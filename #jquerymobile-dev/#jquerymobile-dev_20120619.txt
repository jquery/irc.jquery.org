[03:23:54] <_|Nix|_> Hey d'you guys know of a way to set one select from the change handler of another? À la http://jsbin.com/omacox/231/
[03:24:30] <_|Nix|_> I can't figure out how to set a select ... I mean .val() and then it should be set, right? Well, it seems not.
[03:24:47] <_|Nix|_> ... or rather .val( newValue ) ...

[04:49:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah.
[04:50:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Never figured out how to chain one select to another.
[04:53:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Check out http://jsbin.com/omacox/231/ - can you make it work?

[06:15:06] <MauriceGo> Hi _|Nix|_ !  Have your selects a value?
[06:35:03] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: Check out http://jsbin.com/omacox/231/ I add the values at runtime.
[06:36:25] <MauriceGo> You add a name, no value, or?
[06:38:27] <MauriceGo> _|Nix|_ ^^

[06:41:39] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: I add <option value="sel1op1">Sel 1 Option 1</option>
[06:41:54] <_|Nix|_> mariSo, it has a value and a description.
[06:41:59] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: Y
[06:42:06] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: ^^
[06:42:15] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... My hands are made of clay.
[06:42:49] <_|Nix|_> ... but then when I set .val("sel1op1"), it is not getting set.
[06:43:24] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: Should I use <option name="sel1op1"> ... </option> instead?
[06:43:27] <MauriceGo> _|Nix|_: your code: sel.append( "<option name='" + key + "'>" + value + "</option>" );  there is a name - no value tag
[06:43:42] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: I am an idiot! Thanks!
[06:44:16] <MauriceGo> But changing that, query mobile breaks on a select change ...

[06:46:05] <_|Nix|_> Gah! Pushed a commit that breaks the build ... gotta wait for code.jquery.com/mobile/latest to update.
[06:46:16] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: Yeah, I pushed a broken commit to master :( Fixed now.
[06:49:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: Can you please check if this still happens: http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/popup.png
[06:49:16] <_|Nix|_> ?
[06:49:27] <MauriceGo> on the way ...
[06:50:46] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html seems to be working ...
[06:51:45] <_|Nix|_> MauriceGo: jquerymobile.com/test is great - it has the latest from master much faster than code.jquery.com/mobile/latest
[06:59:03] <MauriceGo> looks great!  no issue anymore.  The popup comes always to the right position no matter where the button is tapped

[07:05:03] <MauriceGo> You're very welcome, _|Nix|_
[07:20:54] <MauriceGo> _|Nix|_: Ready for another odd popup issue? :-)
[07:34:58] <MauriceGo> _|Nix|_: iPhone 4S iOS 5.1 - open popup demo, tap the form popup button and submit the form:
[07:35:08] <MauriceGo> _|Nix|_: all subsequent popup transitions (in and out) bring in the address bar and hide it again
[08:18:58] <agcolom> Hi everyone, _|Nix|_ sorry had to go before I saw your reply!
[08:36:30] <MauriceGo> Hi Anne :-)
[08:37:07] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-)
[08:39:41] <MauriceGo> agcolom: Do you have your iPad with you?
[08:41:50] <agcolom> yes, it's not far... I can get it...
[08:43:05] <agcolom> I've got it...
[08:50:49] <MauriceGo> agocolom: Please try the dialog popup at http://agoserv.ago.local/itouch/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[08:51:20] <MauriceGo> agcolom: please open it and try to close it by tapping outside the dialog
[08:52:42] <MauriceGo> does it work?  if not try the cancel button.  Do you get back to a previous page too?
[08:53:32] <MauriceGo> I sent the wrong link ...  sorry
[08:53:52] <agcolom> ok, I typed the address wrong as well!
[08:54:37] <MauriceGo> just use the test demo
[08:54:51] <MauriceGo> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html   sorry again !
[08:55:32] <agcolom> ok, I'm there
[08:55:48] <MauriceGo> dialog open
[08:56:02] <agcolom> yes
[08:56:06] <agcolom> works for me
[08:56:58] <MauriceGo> If I close the dialog by tapping outside it, it does not close on iPad 2
[08:57:17] <agcolom> but it almost looks like there are 2 dialog popups on top of each other!
[08:57:33] <agcolom> I have an iPad 2 as well but iOS 4.3.3
[08:57:44] <MauriceGo> iOs 5.1 here
[08:57:54] <agcolom> may be an ios issue...
[08:58:06] <agcolom> version ^
[08:59:34] <MauriceGo> i get this just on iPad not on iPhone same OS
[09:01:22] <agcolom> strange. Let me try on iPad 1 iOS 5.1, then i can also try on my iPod Touch iOs5.1
[09:01:46] <MauriceGo> but you got what i mean?
[09:02:44] <MauriceGo> tapping outside the dialog, the popup goes outside the screen and comes back.
[09:03:02] <MauriceGo> then no tap outside it possible anymore
[09:03:21] <MauriceGo> tapping the close button, the browser goes on page back
[09:08:12] <agcolom> yes, that's what I get also on the iPad 1 iOS 5.1
[09:08:35] <agcolom> and I don't get it on the iOS 4.3.3
[09:08:59] <agcolom> But I get this impression that there are 2 popups as well.
[09:10:06] <agcolom> because when it goes on the 4.3.3, it goes smaller first, and moves right and there is another one underneath that disappears when the top one disappears
[09:10:38] <agcolom> and when it appears, it comes from the right, blinks (all gone and comes back).
[09:22:29] <agcolom> MauriceGo, _|Nix|_ this is what happens when you touch outside the dialog popup on the iPAd2 iOS 4.3.3.  http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/popup.png
[09:34:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you see the lint failure and fix it?
[09:35:42] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/162/console
[09:36:00] <johnbender> I might be claiming victory prematurely here, but it looks like the linting already caught something substantial!
[09:36:09] <johnbender> _WORTH IT_
[09:37:21] <agcolom> johnbender: Whaouh! That looks like a very useful message!
[09:37:32] <johnbender> yar
[09:37:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for staying sharp on that
[09:39:09] <agcolom> MauriceGo, _|Nix|_, with that os issue, we need to find out whether this is due to the transition or the content of the popup...
[09:49:32] <MauriceGo> agcolom: I get the same issue with the form popup
[09:51:03] <MauriceGo> but I cannot see a second popup like you above-mentioned
[09:53:49] <MauriceGo> agcolom: please try the photo popup, close, dialog popup: issue away ...
[09:53:50] <agcolom> I don't get the issue with the form popup on iOS 4.3.3. It does blink but I don't get the second popup
[09:54:19] <agcolom> I can't see the picture in hte photo popup!
[09:54:35] <agcolom> let me reload!
[09:54:56] <MauriceGo> yes, same as the jquery mobile logo. Sometimes it's away ...
[09:55:14] <agcolom> oh yes! transition all beautiful after opening photo popup and double popup issue is gone also!
[09:57:34] <MauriceGo> reload page -> dialog popup button -> tap somewhere outside -> tap photo button: two dialogs on the screen
[09:58:44] <gseguin> That's way cool johnbender!
[09:58:49] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[09:58:51] <agcolom> No I don't get that
[09:58:52] <johnbender> it's glorious
[09:59:14] <johnbender> gseguin: now all you suckers without editor modes that detect that crap will be saved from yourselves :D (jk)
[09:59:28] <johnbender> hmm
[09:59:33] <gseguin> I use WebStorm, I'm cool
[09:59:55] <gseguin> it comes for free, I don't have to compile the extension for it ;)
[10:00:00] <johnbender> maybe I can set up a flymake mode that will run the linting in the background for me
[10:00:13] <johnbender> gseguin: heh, fair enough
[10:03:09] <MauriceGo> agcolom: http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/twodialog.png
[10:05:05] <agcolom> very strange!
[10:10:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to get started on addressing these issues today
[10:10:39] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4456#issuecomment-6427957
[10:10:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4456 on jquery-mobile (lthurston; 3w, 3d ago): Static Base Href Value
[10:10:47] <johnbender> there's that one
[10:10:58] <johnbender> but I want to talk with kinblas about some of the other issues
[10:26:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4563
[10:26:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4563 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 2h, 23m ago): The second click on custom selectmenu doesn't work
[10:26:15] <johnbender> did we switch select menus over to the popup?
[10:26:29] <johnbender> it's adding a history entry with a ui-state hash
[10:27:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ^
[11:12:07] <johnbender> anyone have a recommendation of an online xml viewier
[11:12:20] <johnbender> or a free/simple downloadable app
[12:56:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We did.
[12:56:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is that bad?
[12:57:00] * _|Nix|_ go check $4563
[12:57:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... WORKSFORME ...
[13:06:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I made some headway with the perf tests. Added gnuplot as a server-side dependency :) Can we put these into a branch? They kind of assume that they're running inside the jqm git repo.
[13:37:17] <agcolom> johnbender,  I tried this one last year (was looking for something for a guy in Biosciences, so not a developer), seemed nice and simple for him, but not sure that's the sort of thing you're after: http://www.online-xml-editor.com/
[13:39:28] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks
[13:41:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nope just curious - might want to take a look at that issue though :D
[13:41:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hrm, there are so many js graphing libs these days that I guess I'd like to ship some subset of the data and graph the results
[13:42:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hopefully either this week or next week I'm going to address the base tag issue and then I'm going to start looking into setting up some infra for perf monitoring
[13:47:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Alright.
[13:47:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it seems like we need something central so that people can do testing locally and a central location to automate it as well
[13:47:57] <johnbender> like a simple web service with shared secrets, https, and a db
[13:48:08] <johnbender> and we can make the visualization just a client of the data
[13:48:16] <johnbender> since that doesn't really need to be protected
[13:48:51] <johnbender> then a cron/build with some standard deviation math to alert us when things get bad
[13:49:06] <johnbender> still collecting my thoughts
[13:49:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, that's nice, but then we need to group by userid as well, because two different people may well have the same agent string.
[13:49:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: why is that?
[13:49:31] <johnbender> we want to group by the user agent right?
[13:50:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The same agent string running on an Atom will not have the same performance as an agent string running on an Core 7 or whatever.
[13:50:34] <johnbender> indeed
[13:50:48] <johnbender> we could normalize based on some baseline performance number
[13:50:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In fact, I may well have multiple computers from which I run these tests.
[13:51:22] <johnbender> but either way we'd need to have some unique identifier
[13:51:27] <johnbender> which makes this less attractive
[13:51:35] <johnbender> hrm
[13:51:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes, but the unique ID needs to be more than just a username.
[13:51:46] <_|Nix|_> It needs to be machine-specific.
[13:51:48] <johnbender> I'll have to think about that in terms of just automating it to remove that kind of discrepancy
[13:52:16] <johnbender> so confine the recorded data to browser stack stuff
[13:52:21] <johnbender> and just provide the results locally for review
[13:52:35] <johnbender> doing a local regression test for some code change should be easy enough
[13:53:04] <johnbender> that seems like a good balance
[13:53:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. I don't think we can crowdsource this performance testing.
[13:54:12] <johnbender> oh I'm not interested in crowdsourcing it but I thought it might be nice to let the devs do performance testing
[13:54:18] <johnbender> which they can
[13:54:24] <johnbender> the data just won't be recorded
[13:54:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It can be recorded, but it must be done so locally.
[13:55:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OTOH, we could do something like XMPP resources ...
[13:55:16] <johnbender> I'm going to do the server version as a seperate repo
[13:55:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That would identify the machine as well as the person.
[13:55:27] <johnbender> puting it into the library is awkward
[13:55:31] <johnbender> in the same way that the docs are
[13:55:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't want to get too complex
[13:56:00] <johnbender> if I can keep it simple and get 60% of the way there I'll be happy
[13:56:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I guess not.
[13:56:16] <johnbender> the main criteria is making it automatable and being able to report on regressions
[13:56:20] <johnbender> after that it's all icing
[13:56:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: *nod*
[13:57:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, that may be all that's needed - I mean, if I can get a report saying I introduced a performance regression within 15 minutes of pushing a commit, that's not really going to impact the release schedule.
[13:57:37] <johnbender> that's the idea/purpose
[13:57:56] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... that's best, I think ...
[13:58:50] <_|Nix|_> Do jQUI and jQ have perf tests?
[13:58:56] <johnbender> dunno
[13:59:00] <johnbender> that's the other thing
[13:59:10] <johnbender> if we can build something out to help them do the same
[13:59:15] <johnbender> it would be usefull
[13:59:27] <johnbender> just a bunch of pages that serve perf tests and record data
[14:01:21] <_|Nix|_> I think even perf.js is a good step.
[14:02:14] <_|Nix|_> ... but an easy-to-set-up client/server package would be even better. Ideally, they'd have to deploy this on their server and drop in their own tests, and voilà ...
[14:17:47] <_|Nix|_> How serious are we about supporting IE8? There's a problem with popups when they don't have an overlayTheme set. It seems you can't click around the popup to dismiss it. However, if you set an overlayTheme, it works.

[14:24:19] <_|Nix|_> Wow ... in IE8, it seems lack of background also means lack of mouse handling.
[14:24:26] <johnbender> miketaylr: you around?
[14:24:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think we have to support ie8
[14:25:07] <miketaylr> hi johnbender
[14:25:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: *bletch*
[14:25:34] <johnbender> miketaylr: I don't mean to pester you but did you have a chance to take a quick look at that opera syntax_err?
[14:25:45] <johnbender> I also don't meant to dump an issue on you if you're busy
[14:25:49] <johnbender> I can always take a look
[14:26:21] <miketaylr> no worries, there's actually an open issue for it
[14:26:35] <miketaylr> but the suggested fix confuses me... so i'm trying to figure out wtf they mean
[14:26:36] <johnbender> miketaylr: ahh that's right on the forums
[14:26:39] <miketaylr> let me pastie this

[14:30:10] <miketaylr> i don't see how a missing transitionend event would throw that syntax_err
[14:30:23] <miketaylr> but i guess i should build the site with their workaround to really understand it
[14:30:38] <miketaylr> hopefully someone comments tomorrow morning, i've asked how those are related
[14:31:01] <miketaylr> (also i explained to them about the missing css stuff is by design for now)
[14:31:16] <johnbender> yes that's confusing
[14:31:37] <miketaylr> i'll try to follow up when i get a response
[14:32:04] <johnbender> miketaylr: thanks again for looking into it
[14:32:07] <johnbender> we appreciate the help
[14:32:27] <_|Nix|_> From SO: "All it took was a 100% transparent background image and voila!" Very helpful ...
[14:32:29] <miketaylr> np, hopefully it's a simple thing to fix
[14:33:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't think that's going to work for us :(

[14:35:33] <johnbender> :D
[14:35:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Some of these solutions are hairbrained ...
[14:37:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: More M$ bile making a chaotic landscape look like the perfectly still surface of a pond in comparison to IE's state.
[14:37:32] <johnbender> well
[14:37:41] <johnbender> Android has been something of a nightmare
[14:37:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Touché.
[14:38:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Still ... such blatant inconsistency ... it is a very particular kind of madness.
[14:56:04] <_|Nix|_> I'm thinking overlayTheme: ( $.mobile.browser.ie ? "a" : null ) ...
[14:56:14] <_|Nix|_> That'll learn IE ...

[15:15:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4562 on jquery-mobile (noctufaber; 7h, 25m ago): Fixed header overlaps content
[15:16:00] <agcolom> resize the window and the problem is fixed!
[15:16:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am writing a comment on that
[15:16:17] <uGoMobi> yes, but it is still a bug
[15:17:44] <agcolom> I thought i was going mad! because I saw it and then it was gone! Yes, still a bug, but the fact that resizing the window fixes it means it should be easy-ish to fix...
[15:21:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: not so sure... because the padding is there when you inspect the code, but it isn't applied
[15:21:20] <uGoMobi> so I guess it is a timing issue, which can be quite difficult
[15:22:44] <agcolom> I remember someone having exactly the same problem before.... Was that why someone would use settimeout?
