[08:01:37] <toddmparker_> good morning all
[08:02:29] <toddmparker_> Maybe that build failure is the problem with test/...Jankins result is kinda janky, no details
[08:16:48] <toddmparker_> gseguin and johnbender ^^
[08:24:56] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[08:24:57] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #19: FIXED in 2 min 49 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/19/
[08:24:57] <jq-jenkins> * scott: brought back persistent toolbar behavior as an external extension to the fixedToolbar plugin (via option trackPersistentToolbars, default true when included). This also extends persistent toolbar support to headers, whereas previously only footers were supported.
[08:24:58] <jq-jenkins> * scott: buttons tagged with a ui-state-persist class should regain the active button class before page show
[08:24:58] <jq-jenkins> * scott: moved trackPersistentToolbars option into fixedToolbar plugin
[08:24:59] <jq-jenkins> * scott: updated fixed toolbar tests to test the persistent toolbars
[08:24:59] <jq-jenkins> * scott: updated docs to describe that persistent toolbar behavior can now apply to both headers and footers.
[09:01:47] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:01:56] <gseguin> did I miss anything?
[09:02:44] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I think there may have been a problem with github last night
[09:09:59] <toddmparker_> yeah gseguin?
[09:10:31] <gseguin> let me find that email
[09:11:24] <gseguin> oh maybe not with github
[09:11:31] <gseguin> but with git: "hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Could not fetch from any repository"
[09:30:04] <gseguin> I just did a fetch and got this:
[09:30:06] <gseguin> fa0d7bf...bd86a62 toolbar-persist -> upstream/toolbar-persist  (forced update)
[09:30:27] <gseguin> I hope this is not going to create the same trouble at merge than last time
[09:32:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 6 new commits to master: http://git.io/qX4A_w
[09:32:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added depend plugin to handle non-AMD dependencies - Ghislain Seguin
[09:32:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Exclude depend! plugin from the built bundle - Ghislain Seguin
[09:32:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed AMD wrapper from jQuery UI widget base class - Ghislain Seguin
[09:38:45] <gseguin> johnbender: looks like there was a forced push on toolbar-persist branch
[09:39:07] <gseguin> just a heads for the merge
[09:39:17] <gseguin> s/heads/heads up/
[09:39:33] <johnbender> :(
[09:40:06] <gseguin> yeah... :(
[09:40:44] <gseguin> on the bright side I got rid of a circular dependency
[09:42:34] <johnbender> gseguin: yes I saw that
[09:42:40] <johnbender> gseguin: commit link?
[09:43:14] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/65fc59563ed3f1a13c76b147242995f8b1ac362e
[09:43:15] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (12m, 35s ago): Moved $.mobile.gradeA to jquery.mobile.support, it was causing a circular dependency
[09:43:20] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:43:59] <johnbender> gseguin: and that's a very sensible place for it
[09:44:11] <johnbender> +1 for things making more sense after a change
[09:44:25] <johnbender> GO GO DEPENDENCY GRAPH
[09:45:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ok so we have two possible problems with the build here
[09:45:22] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[09:45:33] <johnbender> well two problems period
[09:46:07] <johnbender> 1. the fork for the shell commands, in the case of the most recent failure, that jenkins does is failing because we're running low on memory
[09:46:50] <johnbender> running low on memory for some reason that happens to coincide with the build
[09:47:15] <johnbender> 2. I doesn't appear as simple as I thought it would be to have basecamp be our distribution list
[09:48:53] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the email you'd like to receive alerts at ?
[09:49:01] <johnbender> gseguin: gmail?
[09:49:04] <toddmparker_> the basecamp integration is nice, but not critical
[09:49:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I just wanted an easy way for people to add and remove themselves from a distro list for infra alerts
[09:49:46] <johnbender> not clear on why basecamp didn't send out alerts on that one
[09:50:02] <johnbender> I'll keep that email there so people can check for build failures when things seem off on test
[09:50:32] <johnbender> that is, I'll keep sending emails there for team inspection purposes
[09:50:58] <gseguin> johnbender: yep gmail
[09:51:53] <gseguin> johnbender: switch to node to see if that makes a difference
[09:52:13] <johnbender> gseguin: it's not node
[09:52:23] <johnbender> gseguin: jenkins is forking to run the git command
[09:52:29] <johnbender> long before the build starts at all
[09:52:45] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:53:13] <johnbender> gseguin: hrm
[09:53:57] <gseguin> yeah?
[09:56:21] <johnbender> gseguin: my colleagues tell me I'm wrong because there is no java fork
[09:56:28] <johnbender> though they have infra to creat unix processes
[09:59:17] <johnbender> gseguin: generally speaking this exception happens when, surprise surprise, the jvm can't allocate memory for a given task\
[09:59:30] <johnbender> though I'm a bit worried the external command might be a red herring
[09:59:36] * johnbender stays on his toes
[10:00:33] <gseguin> and you don't think that using node to run the RequireJS will help to reduce memory consumption?
[10:01:01] <johnbender> gseguin: we aren't even at that point when it fails
[10:01:09] <johnbender> gseguin: generally speaking it might
[10:01:18] <johnbender> but only if it's some limit on the jvm and not system memory
[10:01:41] <gseguin> but is it possible that some memory is leaked every time we invoke rhino ?
[10:03:39] <johnbender> gseguin: yes, though it's more likely that jenkins is shitting the bed at a bad time
[10:03:43] <johnbender> gseguin: AND!
[10:03:46] <johnbender> we don't have swap
[10:03:53] <johnbender> which I suspected given the oom
[10:03:59] <gseguin> ouch
[10:04:05] <gseguin> that's not good
[10:04:06] <johnbender> danheberden: rawr we don't have swap space on the jqm server :(
[10:06:52] <danheberden> johnbender it's virtuoso
[10:07:20] <johnbender> danheberden: not sure what you mean
[10:07:46] <danheberden> the virtualization software mt uses effs with fstab/mounts/swap 'n stuff
[10:07:54] <danheberden> i don't know all the details, i just know it's a pita
[10:08:31] <johnbender> danheberden: just to pick that sentence apart so I can go google
[10:08:40] <johnbender> effs is a file system of some sort or another?
[10:08:51] <danheberden> effs == fucks
[10:08:57] <johnbender> lawl
[10:09:13] <danheberden> :D
[10:10:29] <johnbender> danheberden: background - we're getting out of memory exceptions in our jenkins runs
[10:11:05] <johnbender> which is odd since we idle at about half the system memory
[10:11:15] <johnbender> but not out of the question
[10:11:36] <danheberden> johnbender that server is the bitch of the jq servers - for some reason everything ended up on it
[10:11:48] <danheberden> jqm, swarm, builds, etc
[10:12:00] <johnbender> danheberden: yah I noticed :/
[10:12:07] <johnbender> that's ok though
[10:12:24] <johnbender> it's a good opportunity to learn and address the challenges associated with the situation!
[10:12:31] <danheberden> i'm gonna see if i can clone the box to a new server - clarkbox was gonna try to strip out all the non jenkins stuff
[10:12:33] <danheberden> so it was on it's own
[10:12:39] <danheberden> *its
[10:12:58] <danheberden> just catching up with work stuff, and should be able to get back into it soon
[10:16:57] <johnbender> danheberden: which reminds me, It would be amazing to set up some simple monitoring with nagios for the servers
[10:17:03] <johnbender> that's something pretty easy I could do
[10:17:16] <johnbender> and I've got good resources for questions
[10:17:27] <danheberden> johnbender i think the current plan is zabbix,puppet and possible splunk
[10:17:38] <danheberden> feel free to chime in on the issue tho
[10:18:28] <johnbender> danheberden: I'll ask my ops homies about zabbix
[10:18:50] <danheberden> gnarf showed it to me, it looked pretty stellar
[10:26:01] <johnbender> danheberden: if you can't get to cloning the vm, we can just add a swap file to prevent the oom isues
[10:26:15] <johnbender> it won't perform well when it swaps but at least it won't fall on it's face
[10:26:18] <johnbender> though
[10:26:29] <johnbender> I should point out that I'm assuming that's the cause based on my research
[10:26:40] <danheberden> johnbender might be a good idea, though i think snover had tried that to no avail with the box
[10:27:02] <danheberden> don't you have to modify fstab to make a swap file?
[10:27:54] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm under the impression that you can just use mkswap
[10:28:01] <johnbender> danheberden: with a on disk file
[10:28:08] <johnbender> no need to alter partitions
[10:28:20] <danheberden> cool
[10:28:22] <johnbender> I can mess around with it on a local vm before doing anything
[10:30:15] <danheberden> johnbender `ssh root@205.186.153.190`
[10:31:05] <danheberden> do your worst :D
[10:31:40] <johnbender> msg danheberden pass?
[10:31:49] <danheberden> johnbender i added your key
[10:32:51] <danheberden> oh, sorry johnbender messed up
[10:32:57] <danheberden> one sec
[10:35:44] <danheberden> johnbender try now
[10:58:24] <toddmparker_> hi guys...meeting time huh?
[10:58:30] <toddmparker_> be off my call in a minute...
[10:58:35] <toddmparker_> gseguin: can you set up a link?
[11:00:11] * gseguin creates the hangout
[11:01:23] <gseguin> https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/jquerymobile-meeting
[11:09:57] <gseguin> johnbender, kinblas: are you joining the meeting?
[11:10:21] <kinblas> doh sorry, yeah joining
[11:10:24] <johnbender> gseguin: indeed
[11:10:37] <gseguin> just saw you're in johnbender
[11:10:46] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_: kinblas: Wilto: as a heads up there's a build failure incoming
[11:11:11] <johnbender> I think I must have failed to re-enable the build when I set up the version builds
[11:11:17] <johnbender> looks like fixed toolbar failures
[11:11:22] <johnbender> all of which look like timing issues
[11:12:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #432: FAILURE in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/432/
[11:12:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * me: Issue #1524 - Taphold event fired while scrolling on Blackberry Playbook
[11:12:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * me: Issue #1524 - Fixing style - Missing white space
[11:12:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: A new utility: $.mobile.zoom, which as 3 members: enabled [bool], disable [function], and enable [function].
[11:12:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed a duplicate listing
[11:12:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added meta viewport tag
[11:13:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added zoom dependency and removed internal handling of page zoom enable/disable, opting to use the zoom plugin methods instead
[11:13:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed up the unit tests so that they only test the plugin's usage of the zoom methods, not the result of whether those methods are working
[11:13:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: use maximum scale instead of user-scaling, as it's more reliable for restoring zoom
[11:13:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added unit tests for the zoom plugin
[11:13:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added a restore method, similar to a widget's destroy. Restores the meta content back to original value
[11:13:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: moved the iosfocusfix logic over to the selectmenu plugin. It's now toggled via a new option: preventFocusZoom (Default is true).
[11:13:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added files to index php
[11:13:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: switched up this check so it binds the events regardless of initial state, in case it's toggled later
[11:13:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added unit tests for prevent focus zoom option
[11:13:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: This change brings the iOS orientationchange bug workaround up to the latest code from that external project, with an experimental attempt at iOS4.3 support on the 3GS using the devicemotion event, which may be a bad idea to use unthrottled - not sure yet. This code needs to be tested on a device with iOS5, and I imagine the check for deviceorientation will also need a check for the value of evt.gamma. At that point, we may dec
[11:13:05] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated to use only the devicemotion event, for compatibility and less battery battering
[11:13:05] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated to bulletproof further
[11:13:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed the weather experiment
[11:13:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed the google maps experiment
[11:13:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed the converter experiment
[11:13:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated platform support to include Bada and UCweb.
[11:13:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Removed use of order! plugin
[11:13:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Added comment
[11:13:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed ability to set "fullscreen" on the page itself. Instead, this should be set on the fixed toolbar elements.
[11:13:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: renamed togglePageZoom option disablePageZoom
[11:13:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed up the unit tests to ensure the disablePageZoom option works as expected
[11:13:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: some edits to make sure proper classes are toggled for the slide transition to work, if it's set.
[11:13:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: set the default toolbars transition to slide, because it looks kinda nice
[11:13:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added an argument to the show and hide methods to specify that no transition should be used, regardless of the default transition type. This is now used on pageshow, so the toolbar does not use an animated transition when the page is initially shown.
[11:13:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added support for the updatelayout event, so that fixed toolbars can be manually updated through this event alongside other plugins that subscribe to it.
[11:13:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated documentation on the new fixedtoolbar plugin.
[11:13:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: ensure that fullscreen toolbars do not animate in when the page is first shown
[11:13:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: TODO update jquery version in tag replace
[11:13:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: Makefile whitespace
[11:13:25] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: use jquery min for deploy build
[11:13:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mail: Update css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css
[11:13:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: use the pathname and search as the base comparison directory
[11:13:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: whitespace in the fixedToolbar tests
[11:13:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: default class is slidedown
[11:13:38] <gseguin> ARRRRGGHH !
[11:13:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: remove ordering dep
[11:13:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: restored loading icon background color
[11:13:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: brought back persistent toolbar behavior as an external extension to the fixedToolbar plugin (via option trackPersistentToolbars, default true when included). This also extends persistent toolbar support to headers, whereas previously only footers were supported.
[11:13:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: buttons tagged with a ui-state-persist class should regain the active button class before page show
[11:13:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: moved trackPersistentToolbars option into fixedToolbar plugin
[11:13:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated fixed toolbar tests to test the persistent toolbars
[11:13:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated docs to describe that persistent toolbar behavior can now apply to both headers and footers.
[11:13:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Added depend plugin to handle non-AMD dependencies
[11:13:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Exclude depend! plugin from the built bundle
[11:13:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Removed AMD wrapper from jQuery UI widget base class
[11:13:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Moved $.mobile.gradeA to jquery.mobile.support, it was causing a circular dependency
[11:13:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Use depend! plugin to express jquery hashchange plugin's dependency on jQuery
[11:13:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Minimize the number of modules required, let RequireJS do the work for us
[11:13:50] <gseguin> another jqm-jenkins-bot vomiting session
[11:59:58] <johnbender> LUNCH
[12:00:35] <toddmparker_> YUM
[12:00:38] <toddmparker_> starving
[12:00:48] <toddmparker_> just eating now
[12:05:34] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah just confirmed in an old jqm tree, that the orientation test I have works like a charm, while the HEAD reports that orientation is not supported
[12:05:58] <toddmparker_> hrmm
[12:06:05] <toddmparker_> diff?
[12:13:46] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the only difference to the file I touched to fix that bug (jquery.mobile.events.js) was some module define change and some tap changes ... nothing related to orientation, so it's outside of that file
[12:14:20] <kinblas> toddmparker_: johnbender: gseguin: what is the version of jquery.js we have in the repository?
[12:15:17] <kinblas> ah nevermind, I see in commit history that it is now 1.7.1
[12:22:48] <toddmparker_> yep
[12:31:49] <JasonDScott> Hey guys, someone here was asking me JQM ever cleans up the DOM after the page transitions. My gut thought was that it doesn't but can someone confirm?
[12:33:50] <toddmparker_> yes, we delete any pages brought in by ajax when they transition out
[12:33:58] <toddmparker_> ther eis a global option to turn this feature off
[12:34:01] <toddmparker_> domcache
[12:37:36] <JasonDScott> Is the main/first page ever deleted?
[12:51:16] <johnbender> JasonDScott: no
[12:51:19] <johnbender> it's a special case
[12:51:33] <JasonDScott> ok thanks
[12:52:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to punt on solving the memory issues on our server for now
[12:56:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin and I will get emails now directly from the server (though basecamp will still get updated) so we should be able to sort out issues quickly
[12:59:01] <toddmparker_> great
[12:59:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: luckily we haven't seen any build failures with the build itself
[12:59:33] <johnbender> just failures with jenkins :(
[12:59:48] * johnbender sometimes wonders about jenkins
[13:00:30] <toddmparker_> beh
[13:30:06] <gseguin> aaaand we're back
[13:40:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: question for you
[13:40:23] <johnbender> the fixed toolbar default transition is slidedown eh?
[13:40:33] <johnbender> the test had it as fade
[13:40:41] <johnbender> and then it also tested that it had the class in
[13:40:44] <johnbender> `in`
[13:41:01] <johnbender> I'm guessing that `in` is useless with regards to sliding?
[13:43:57] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: ping
[13:44:06] <johnbender> kinblas: pong
[13:44:23] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: is http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js supposed to be blank?
[13:44:32] <gseguin> kinblas: 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.062 ms
[13:44:42] <kinblas> gseguin: heh
[13:44:44] <johnbender> o.O
[13:45:09] <gseguin> no it's not supposed to be blank
[13:46:38] <kinblas> gseguin: ok, so that's a problem eh? That's one reason why I think http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/functional/orientation.html is broken
[13:48:37] * gseguin looks
[13:49:14] <toddmparker_> sure
[13:49:31] <toddmparker_> ah, yes scott changed them to slide in
[13:50:00] <toddmparker_> i'd say that missing code might break some stuff
[13:51:19] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:51:38] <gseguin> johnbender: what does /test point at?
[13:51:54] <kinblas> js/jquery.mobile.docs
[13:52:14] <johnbender> gseguin: /compiled/demos per your recommendation :D
[13:53:29] <kinblas> johnbender: the other reason why I think orientation.html (mentioned above) is broken is because the pageinit callback it registers isn't firing
[13:54:08] <kinblas> what is the voodoo that folks have to do to make sure their event handlers are registered before the framework (loaded via require.js) initializes?
[13:54:23] <kinblas> ... use js/?
[13:54:25] <kinblas> :-D
[13:54:34] <johnbender> kinblas: yah do that and mobileinit imo
[13:54:45] <johnbender> don't waste your time with creating another meta module
[13:54:51] <kinblas> ok
[13:58:59] * gseguin fixes it
[13:59:25] <gseguin> ok it's happening locally too:
[13:59:27] <gseguin> ghislain.seguin@macjiver ~/src/jquery-mobile/compiled/demos/js
[13:59:27] <gseguin> [10282] git:master* $ cat jquery.mobile.js
[13:59:27] <gseguin> ghislain.seguin@macjiver ~/src/jquery-mobile/compiled/demos/js
[13:59:41] <gseguin> it shouldn't be hard to fix :D
[14:00:12] <johnbender> gseguin: are you going to handle it or should I?

[14:01:03] <gseguin> fixed
[14:03:05] <kinblas> aha, js/index.php is broken too
[14:03:13] <kinblas> had ,js instead of .js in there too
[14:03:19] <kinblas> I'll check in the change
[14:04:28] <gseguin> et voila...

[14:09:43] <gseguin> fixing it
[14:10:24] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: I feel a bit bad/weird that this test is using js/ and everything else is using the require.js way
[14:10:38] <kinblas> but switching back to js/ fixes things for me
[14:12:26] <gseguin> kinblas: it should work by pointing at jquery.mobile.js after my next push

[15:40:07] <johnbender> gseguin: what text editor do you use?
[15:40:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are you running the relevant test suite after your changes?
[15:40:33] <gseguin> WebStorm & Sublime Text 2
[15:40:35] <gseguin> why?
[15:40:38] <johnbender> maybe I need to be clear about that
[15:40:41] <johnbender> gseguin: just wondering
[15:40:55] <toddmparker_> errr...not for these because they are content edits
[15:41:02] <gseguin> jrburke: are you there?
[15:41:13] <toddmparker_> if i touch css or js, i do
[15:41:18] <toddmparker_> is that ok?
[15:41:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[15:41:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #433: FIXED in 26 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/433/
[15:41:45] <jrburke> gseguin: hi
[15:41:51] <gseguin> hi
[15:42:01] <toddmparker_> johnbender: did something I do break the build?
[15:42:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: oh no
[15:42:15] <toddmparker_> whew
[15:42:19] <johnbender> scotts changes to the fixedToolbar broke it
[15:42:36] * gseguin is phrasing is question for jrburke
[15:43:04] <gseguin> jrburke: this command line:
[15:43:27] <gseguin> node external/r.js/dist/r.js -o build/docs.build.js dir=../tmp/jquery.mobile
[15:43:39] <gseguin> used to work with r.js 1.0.3
[15:43:56] <gseguin> I just upgraded to 1.0.5 and it's not working anymore
[15:44:14] <gseguin> I get:
[15:44:15] <gseguin> Error: Error: Error evaluating module "undefined" at location "/Users/ghislain.seguin/Dropbox/src/jquery-mobile/compiled/demos/js/../external/requirejs/order.js":
[15:44:15] <gseguin> Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory '/Users/ghislain.seguin/Dropbox/src/jquery-mobile/compiled/demos/js/../external/requirejs/order.js'
[15:44:15] <gseguin> fileName:/Users/ghislain.seguin/Dropbox/src/jquery-mobile/compiled/demos/js/../external/requirejs/order.js
[15:44:33] <toddmparker_> i see
[15:44:50] <toddmparker_> shoot him a BC message about that for sure so he knows
[15:44:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm just wondering if folks run the tests for the section of code they are editing
[15:45:03] <jrburke> gseguin: oh i just got a report of that, that the dir= mixin is not working...
[15:45:05] <gseguin> jrburke: it looks like baseUrl is relative to dir
[15:45:29] <jrburke> gseguin: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/177 i probably just did something silly
[15:45:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #177 on requirejs, reported by DashBDev (2d, 3h ago): dir on command line does not override dir in build.js
[15:45:35] <toddmparker_> johnbender: nice emacs tip, but I don't live in the matrix :p
[15:45:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm pretty sure he does since he seems to always add tests for his new work
[15:45:38] <gseguin> oh crap, ok I'll revert the upgrade and wait for that to land before upgrading
[15:45:40] <jrburke> gseguin: i can push on getting a 1.0.6 out
[15:45:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: :D
[15:45:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it never hurts to learn how to use a decent text editor
[15:45:58] <toddmparker_> yeah, he's very good about writing tests and running 'em
[15:46:05] <toddmparker_> hey, i know textmate
[15:46:07] <gseguin> jrburke: just want to check if it was a user error or not
[15:46:19] <toddmparker_> it even ties into terminal
[15:46:26] <gseguin> I'll wait for 1.0.6 to upgrade then
[15:46:30] <gseguin> thanks!
[15:46:51] <toddmparker_> there are a few other fixed toolbar things he's working on tonight anyway
[15:47:13] <toddmparker_> ok guys, gotta run!
[15:47:20] <toddmparker_> see you tomorrow
[15:47:28] <jrburke> gseguin: ok it will likely be a week before i get to a 1.0.6, but if you want it sooner, I can front load that bug.
[15:48:00] <gseguin> jrburke: no rush on our side
[15:48:15] <jrburke> gseguin: ok
[15:49:43] <gseguin> kinblas: the orientation test should work on iPad only, right?
[15:49:51] <gseguin> not on desktop
[15:49:58] <gseguin> right ?
[15:50:02] <kinblas> gseguin: everywhere
[15:50:12] <gseguin> hmm
[15:50:49] <gseguin> weird
[15:51:22] <gseguin> it now works on iPad but not on desktop, it still says: "Orientation Not Supported" on desktop
[15:53:51] <kinblas> in my version, prior to the requirejs stuff ... it reports landscape/portrait in desktop browsers depending on how wide the browser window was
[15:54:11] <kinblas> gseguin: if you switch to using js/ do you get the same result
[15:54:13] <kinblas> ??
[15:54:22] <gseguin> yep I see that here: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0.1/demos/tests/functional/orientation.html
[15:54:27] <gseguin> I'll make it work
