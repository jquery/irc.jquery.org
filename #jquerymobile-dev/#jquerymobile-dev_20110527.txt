[06:41:30] <StevenBlack> It's a predicate to ?docs#m1555
[06:41:31] <bot-t> [#1555] Implement a global system to control DOM size (open, 6 - Blocker, stevenblack) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1555
[07:13:05] <toddparker> hey stevenblack - i saw that, awesome
[07:13:22] <toddparker> kinblas - can you take a look at this
[07:17:08] <toddparker> he would be the best to review the tech stuff
[07:47:17] <toddparker> working on the blog psot now
[08:18:55] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/?p=719&preview=true
[08:19:02] <toddparker> can you all see this?
[08:24:12] <kinblas> no
[08:24:15] <kinblas> "Not Found"
[08:25:08] <toddparker> hrm
[08:25:14] <toddparker> i'll have to add you
[08:25:24] <toddparker> eddiemonge - was there an issue for this fix? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1723
[08:27:05] <toddparker> kinblas - you're already an editor on the wp install - username is kinblas
[08:27:15] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/wp-admin
[08:27:17] <kinblas> pwd?
[08:27:35] <kinblas> you can private message me the password :-)
[08:27:39] <toddparker> did you try your normal pwds?
[08:27:45] <toddparker> of course!
[08:27:47] <kinblas> normal?
[08:27:55] <kinblas> I seem to remember logging in one time
[08:27:57] <kinblas> hang on
[08:28:32] <toddparker> reset. email send
[08:31:18] <kinblas> blog post looks good
[08:31:24] <kinblas> I need to make one more tiny bug fix
[08:31:36] <kinblas> for loading internal pages
[08:32:21] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:47:58] <toddparker> ok, kinblas
[08:48:07] <toddparker> for the decoupling?
[08:48:18] <toddparker> any other nav features we want to announce this week?
[08:48:57] <toddparker> did you get a chance to review steveblack's pull?
[08:48:57] <toddparker> [irc://chat.freenode.net/#1713] $.mobile.removePage() & Issue irc://chat.freenode.net/#1554 fix (open) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1713
[08:49:11] <toddparker> should that wait for next week?
[08:49:24] <kinblas> I didn't get a chance to do squat this week except fix bugs and unit tests :-)
[08:49:50] <kinblas> this bug I'm fixing has to do with programatic calls to changePage() that developers make
[08:50:05] <kinblas> changePage calls that originate from our internals are all ok
[08:50:17] <kinblas> has to do with stripping a leading # character
[08:50:38] <kinblas> I'm just doing some testing of a couple of things before I check itin
[08:53:55] <kinblas> toddparker: looking at the 1713 fix from StevenBlack, it doesn't look like it walks the entire stack before pruning. It only checks to make sure it doesn't blow away the current page and the first page on the stack
[08:57:07] <StevenBlack> kinblas: that's not the point of 1713.
[08:57:39] <StevenBlack> 1713 is about a generic $.mobile.removePage().
[08:58:13] <kinblas> yeah I understand that
[08:58:29] <kinblas> I'm just wondering what the impact is of blowing something away that's still on the stack
[08:58:35] <StevenBlack> So it would have to walk the entire stack why, exactly?
[08:59:08] <kinblas> is it assumed that if cache=false that there is no state needed on the page about to be blown away, even if it is in the current navigation stack?
[08:59:20] <kinblas> for example, what if the page was showing a dialog
[08:59:27] <kinblas> or a select dialog
[09:01:06] <StevenBlack> Is this a requirement?
[09:01:35] <kinblas> is what a requirement?
[09:02:01] <StevenBlack> removePage removes a passed page by URL or selector.
[09:02:31] <StevenBlack> It won't remove the ui-activepage because that just makes sense.
[09:02:44] <kinblas> I think the problem I have is more with the pagehide callback
[09:02:46] <StevenBlack> it won't remove the home page for many reasons.  Just makes sense.
[09:03:08] <StevenBlack> Oh *that*.
[09:03:45] <kinblas> ya mon, that
[09:03:51] <StevenBlack> Well the removePage() is separate from that.  That's what I'm mostly wondering about because that's predicate to other dev.
[09:04:41] <StevenBlack> See pull requests tend to linger for days without comment and when you have a predicate pull, that sucks.
[09:05:34] <kinblas> it's been a bad few weeks in terms of man hours for all of us ... hence the pull request pile-up
[09:05:52] <kinblas> the whitespace changes are going to especially suck :-P
[09:06:05] <kinblas> if they don't get in right away that is
[09:08:40] <StevenBlack> Offhand I don't see ant way of knowing if a page spawns a dialog.  IOW, pagehide is all or nothing.
[09:09:30] <kinblas> There are other cases aside from dialogs ... the thing I keep harping on in the last few meetings is that we just won't know the intent
[09:09:43] <kinblas> for all we know the user clicked on a help me button that goes to a help page
[09:09:49] <kinblas> if we prune the previous page
[09:10:02] <kinblas> we won't know if we just screwed their app state management or not
[09:10:36] <kinblas> that's why I keep saying ... give them tools, show them how to do it if they need to, but let them be responsible for it
[09:10:48] <kinblas> if we're too smart, we'll inevitably get in trouble
[09:10:50] <StevenBlack> Well exactly+
[09:11:41] * StevenBlack is testing if removing the dialog-issuing page works.
[09:12:28] <kinblas> btw, I really don't like this data-url scheme for lookups that we have ... I'd prefer a dictionary/hash lookup because its faster ... its one of the things I have on my list of things to investigate for performance
[09:14:37] <StevenBlack> a hearty +1 to that.
[09:19:08] <StevenBlack> Whew.  On that branch, setting $.mobile.page.prototype.options.cache=false, then opening a dialog, $(".ui-page").length= 2.  Meaning only the home page and the dialog are in the DOM.  Closing the dialog I get the original page ( yes! ) and $(".ui-page").length=3 (and remains 3 thereafter) which is perfect.  According to current intent anyway.
[09:19:50] * StevenBlack is thinking that dialogs should get scrubbed too if $.mobile.page.prototype.options.cache=false
[09:20:16] <StevenBlack> So the dialog case is safe.
[09:21:10] <StevenBlack> BTW, $.mobile.page.prototype.options.cache is new in this branch, simply a global way of setting data-cache=true/false.
[09:24:50] <toddparker> i just pushed the blog post live...going to tweet now
[09:26:33] <kinblas> StevenBlack: so you tested where navigated from first page, to second page, to dialog? So that there are 3 things on the stack?
[09:27:45] <StevenBlack> When the dialog is showing, there are 2 things on the stack if $.mobile.page.prototype.options.cache=false (which is functionally the same as the second page being data-cache="false") yes.
[09:28:07] <StevenBlack> So pagehide scrubs the dialog-calling page.
[09:28:29] <StevenBlack> closing the dialog has no bad side-effects that I can see.
[09:29:18] <StevenBlack> I see a GET for the page we scrubbed as the dialog came up.
[09:29:48] <StevenBlack> Now if that page contained a form, different story.  Not good.
[09:30:32] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/05/27/jquery-mobile-team-update-week-of-may-23/
[09:30:34] <StevenBlack> How about testing for :input elements and, if present, don't scrub.
[09:32:57] <StevenBlack> kinblas: so far, two things to add: 1) scrub dialogs too, and 2) don't scrub pages/dialogs with any sort of input elements inside.
[09:59:48] <gseguin> _nickel: for your jsHint thinggy did you fork the lintnode project?
[10:00:07] <_nickel> gseguin: no I created a service using express
[10:00:21] <_nickel> the shell script uses curl to check the files
[10:00:22] <gseguin> yeah that's basically what they've done
[10:00:29] <_nickel> interesting
[10:00:32] <_nickel> looking into it
[10:00:50] <gseguin> how do you make the curl script exit an error code when the validation has failed
[10:00:50] <gseguin> ?
[10:01:10] <gseguin> I'm looking into that as well for Jive
[10:01:20] <_nickel> gseguin: its a warning right now
[10:01:26] <_nickel> I want to test it for a while
[10:01:30] <_nickel> but its a just a line count of the output
[10:01:40] <_nickel> if there's output, there's a problem :D
[10:02:31] <_nickel> gseguin: also I added a set of chef recipes for deployment since setting up node is annoying/hard
[10:02:40] <_nickel> gseguin: let me push what I have
[10:02:48] <_nickel> and I'll send you the repo link
[10:02:52] <gseguin> sure
[10:02:58] <gseguin> I've cloned lintnode
[10:03:24] <gseguin> I'll push shortly  you can take a look, you probably are ahead of me
[10:04:01] <gseguin> I think I have to process the output of the curl call with awk or something similar for the curl script to return an exit code different than 0 when validation failed
[10:04:13] <gseguin> but awk gives me a headache
[10:30:20] <_nickel> gseguin: https://github.com/johnbender/jshint-service
[10:30:24] <_nickel> thats what's done so far
[10:30:52] <_nickel> most of the effort (aside from learning express and how to install node properly) went into the bash
[10:31:05] <_nickel> gseguin: https://github.com/johnbender/jshint-service/blob/master/pre-commit.sh
[10:31:28] <_nickel> ugh whitespace fail
[10:31:39] <_nickel> using tabs in jqm is taking a toll on my other projects lol
[10:34:17] <_nickel> gseguin: if you drink my Vagrant koolaid you can have running locally in a minute or two
[10:34:51] <gseguin> _nickel: what's that?
[10:35:05] <_nickel> gseguin: project that a friend of mine and I started vagrantup.com
[10:35:15] <_nickel> gseguin: disqus is using it, tumblr is using it
[10:35:21] <_nickel> gseguin: actually that remind me
[10:35:39] <_nickel> gseguin: does anton frequent any of the irc channels, I'm curious if he's using it
[10:36:04] <gseguin> who's anton?
[10:36:28] * gseguin feels like a n00b
[10:36:50] <_nickel> gseguin: from disqus
[10:36:54] <_nickel> gseguin: jshint author
[10:37:02] <_nickel> ?forker
[10:37:03] <_nickel> lol
[10:37:04] <bot-t> _nickel, Day 52 @ Slashprog Technologies « - http://sraji.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/day-52-slashprog-technologies/
[10:37:22] <gseguin> oh duh! sorry, didn't check the author name, should have
[10:37:22] <_nickel> hmm
[10:37:35] <_nickel> anyone know anything about that bot?
[10:38:18] <gseguin> I whish I did, is there any kind of cheat sheet for bot-t?
[10:38:18] <bot-t> gseguin, Stored "I whish I did,".
[10:38:38] <gseguin> wait, what ?
[10:38:42] <_nickel> lol
[10:38:51] <_nickel> you mentioned his name
[10:38:53] <gseguin> lol
[10:38:58] <_nickel> bot-t go away
[10:39:03] <_nickel> go away bot-t
[10:39:26] <gseguin> maybe you're being too polite
[10:39:41] <_nickel> fuck off bot-t
[10:39:43] <_nickel> ?
[10:39:43] <_nickel> lol
[11:00:31] <kinblas> StevenBlack: I landed the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1712
[11:00:36] <kinblas> thanks for flagging it yesterday
[11:00:45] * kinblas steps out for a couple of hours
[11:01:09] <StevenBlack> Good work, kinblas.
[11:36:19] <gseguin> _nickel: you probably want to add 'debugger' to the list of verbotten words in your pre-commit.sh
[12:04:08] <toddparker> nice work steveblack and kinblas on chasing down that issue 1712
[12:04:15] <toddparker> we had a productive week
[12:04:50] <toddparker> every tie i write a blog post, i'm always surprised at all the goodness we do in a week
[12:05:45] <toddparker> wish i had started blogged weekly earlier. we must have missed so many details between releases. oh well, lesson learned
[12:07:30] <eddiemonge> ?m1712
[12:07:33] <bot-t> [#1712] $.mobile.changePage broken in latest (closed, 6 - Blocker) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1712
[12:08:37] <eddiemonge> scott is never around when i want him to be
[12:08:51] <eddiemonge> gseguin: did you have a chance to test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1723 ?
[12:09:04] <eddiemonge> ?1507
[12:09:08] <eddiemonge> ?m1507
[12:10:53] <bot-t> eddiemonge, test2.html on Ticket #4158 – Attachment – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/4158/test2.html
[12:10:54] <bot-t> [#1507] page change css error (open, 6 - Blocker, Ghislain) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1507
[12:14:37] <eddiemonge> anyone want to double check https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1724?
[12:28:52] <StevenBlack> ?tell eddiemonge he can use the bot-t tell command to say things to Scott.
[12:28:52] <bot-t> StevenBlack, Okay.
[12:29:10] <eddiemonge> i know but the pull was already merged
[12:29:10] <bot-t> (18 secs ago) <StevenBlack> tell eddiemonge he can use the bot-t tell command to say things to Scott.
[12:30:10] <StevenBlack> eddiemonge: in short, what's the trick to incrporating a third-party commit into another pull request, like you did with my commit in 1724?
[12:31:12] <eddiemonge> i honestly have no idea how i did it
[12:31:22] <eddiemonge> i think i pulled it in as a patch
[12:32:13] <eddiemonge> i think the trick was: curl http://github.com/github/jobs/pull/25.patch | git am
[12:32:45] <eddiemonge> so curl path-to-pull-request/number.patch | git am
[12:34:44] <eddiemonge> 		
[12:34:44] <eddiemonge> eddiemonge: it woudl save a lot of space if there was a global  jqmDataPrefix = "data-" + $.mobile.ns	
[12:34:44] <eddiemonge> it's used four times in this one file alone	
[12:34:44] <eddiemonge> eddiemonge	hmm yeah. want to go through and do that? or should i suggest it to the team?	
[12:34:54] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin	maybe a setDataAttr() helper too or instead, that would shorten .attr("data-" + $.mobile.ns + "direction", "reverse") to .setDataAttr("direction", "reverse");
[12:35:06] <eddiemonge> ^^^^ thats a suggestion from DaveMethvin
[12:35:21] <StevenBlack> That's a good suggestion.
[12:35:48] <StevenBlack> (thanks for the git pointer. I try to learn something new about git every day.)
[12:36:24] <eddiemonge> StevenBlack: i learned that after i merged your repo with mine.
[12:36:40] <eddiemonge> got it from http://help.github.com/pull-requests/
[12:37:12] <eddiemonge> only warning would be that currently it will grab changes to $.mobile.ns as they are made, but i would think it's not valid to change that after the page initializes
[12:53:35] <eddiemonge> can we add options to hook into the dialog's create and close methods? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.dialog.js
[12:57:22] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I still need to get to that
[13:00:09] <eddiemonge> can someone assign https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1729 to me please?
[13:15:49] <eddiemonge> toddparker: maybe you should put the week ending May 27 instead of Week of May 23
[13:15:55] <eddiemonge> just me nitpicking though
[13:30:37] <_nickel> eddiemonge: kinblas: toddparker: gseguin_: gseguin: https://gist.github.com/3848fe9157412b21e65c
[13:30:51] <_nickel> gseguin_: I added the debugger per your request
[13:32:29] <_nickel> its a post commit hook the runs files staged in the index for commit through jshint
[13:32:46] <_nickel> it _won't_ prevent a commit
[13:32:55] <_nickel> the console debugger and alert statements will
[13:33:06] <_nickel> let me know if you run into anything
[13:33:10] <_nickel> the only dependency is curl
[13:33:18] <_nickel> I'll put this in an email
[13:33:43] <gseguin> is pre or post commit?
[13:35:33] <eddiemonge> bug or not: if a page is stuck with the loading animation, hitting the browsers back button goes back to the real previous page, not the previous jQM page
[13:35:38] <gseguin> _nickel: looks good
[13:40:51] <eddiemonge> _nickel: i wonder if it would make sense to use node.js with jshint
[13:41:03] <_nickel> eddiemonge: thats waht the service is :D
[13:41:13] <_nickel> eddiemonge: I removed the dependency
[13:41:32] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I tested  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1723
[13:41:35] <_nickel> eddiemonge: https://github.com/johnbender/jshint-service/
[13:41:54] <gseguin> eddiemonge: there is a weird thing
[13:42:04] <eddiemonge> oh, you created that service and are connecting to that?
[13:42:18] <gseguin> check out http://jsbin.com/ijixi4/13/edit
[13:42:27] <gseguin> that one works great
[13:42:54] <eddiemonge> yeah. whats the weird thing though?
[13:43:09] <gseguin> but this one: http://jsbin.com/ijixi4/10/edit which contains both of the modified rules does not work
[13:43:16] <gseguin> nothing shows up
[13:44:47] <eddiemonge> gseguin: you have display: none in there
[13:46:20] <eddiemonge> overriding the display block which was overriding the previous display none
[13:46:39] <gseguin> That might explain the fact that I don't jsee anything :D
[13:47:35] <gseguin> this is copy/paste from your check-in though
[13:49:05] <eddiemonge> see my comment above
[13:52:36] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying
[13:53:10] <eddiemonge> so this one: http://jsbin.com/ijixi4/10/edit
[13:53:21] <gseguin> are you saying that the JSBin is missing something? Or that I should remove the display: none to test?
[13:53:32] <eddiemonge> you have that set of styles with the display: none on the .ui-page element
[13:53:55] <eddiemonge> it overrides a previous style rule that changes it display:block so thats why you arent seeing anything
[13:54:01] <eddiemonge> cascading styles and all that
[13:54:36] <gseguin> oh ok so it's one of these where it's defined multiple times
[13:54:59] <eddiemonge> yeah
[13:55:23] <gseguin> alright so removing the display: none takes us to a situation close to real world
[13:57:24] <gseguin> eddiemonge: tested on BB6, iOS 4.2.1, Android 2.0
[13:57:51] <gseguin> any other platform that you need it tested on?
[13:58:33] <eddiemonge> nope. the testing is retroactive anyway since scott pulled it in already. i just wanted to make sure it looks good across a reasonable amount of devices
[13:59:24] <gseguin> alright, issue resolved then, well done!
[14:00:52] <eddiemonge> lol
[14:14:39] <kinblas> yo did someone checkin something that changed styling for checkboxes and radios?
[14:14:57] <kinblas> I see them hanging out from beneath our styled divs
[14:15:15] <kinblas> If you go here: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/lists/lists-forms.html
[14:15:33] <kinblas> and use FF you can see the native widget poking out below the styled markup
[14:16:21] <eddiemonge> i havent yet but im going to modifying the css for those soon
[14:17:38] <kinblas> to fix that problem?
[14:17:45] <eddiemonge> but the problem for those is the ui-checkbox class is set to display inline instead of inline-block
[14:17:46] <kinblas> or to do something else?
[14:17:57] <eddiemonge> among other styling issues
[14:19:21] <gseguin> kinblas: Could it be https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f929e90a70aa87f5ad55f24e1427b14039fb3ae4 ?
[14:20:10] <kinblas> gseguin: not sure, but I've never seen it do that before
[14:20:16] <kinblas> so this feels new
[14:20:21] <kinblas> can you repro in firefox?
[14:22:09] <eddiemonge> this is the problem: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/themes/default/jquery.mobile.controlgroup.css#L17
[19:00:30] <_nickel> anyone tried the pre commit hook I sent out earlier?
[22:07:01] <gseguin> ?tell _nickel I found a good reason to use a form and upload the file to jshint-service: if you want to provide specific options to the jshint call. I think that can be convenient.
[22:07:02] <bot-t> gseguin, Okay.
[22:27:49] <gseguin> hey _nickel
[22:28:11] <_nickel> gseguin: yo!
[22:28:11] <bot-t> (21 mins 10 secs ago) <gseguin> tell _nickel I found a good reason to use a form and upload the file to jshint-service: if you want to provide specific options to the jshint call. I think that can be convenient.
[22:28:22] <gseguin> thanks bot-t
[22:28:23] * bot-t sighs
[22:28:30] <_nickel> gseguin: we can do that via post params
[22:28:33] <_nickel> :D
[22:28:40] <_nickel> its on my todo list for the service
[22:29:13] <gseguin> I was working on it
[22:29:18] <_nickel> gseguin: also you could make the case that its better for the project if its left as a server setting
[22:29:26] <_nickel> so that its a standard
[22:29:30] <_nickel> and can't be futzed with
[22:29:40] <_nickel> debatable
[22:29:55] <_nickel> still don't need the form though
