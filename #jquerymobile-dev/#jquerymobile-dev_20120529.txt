[01:21:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fix-4423] [popup] Deal with the fact that hashchange will not happen if the page has already had a starting dialog hash key - Gabriel Schulhof
[01:42:08] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ Good morning :-) did you see my comment a few days ago about popups in Opera mini?
[01:59:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey! Yeah, but I didn't get the gist of it. What exactly did you observe?
[02:12:04] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ Hi, yes, when I launch a popup on Opera mini, the page does a slide transition to the same page with the popup on top.
[02:14:06] <_|Nix|_> I see - it doesn't do the special case logic. Well, you know what? With what I'm about to push, it just might ... unless it destroys everything.
[02:15:23] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ ok, will try again when that's ready :-)
[02:17:09] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah ... it's a pretty significant change ... I hope it doesn't botch the whole thing ...
[02:17:24] <_|Nix|_> I've tested it to death, but still ...
[02:18:02] <_|Nix|_> ... and it still breaks on IE8 ... but then, I think a lot of things break on IE8 ...
[02:22:09] <agcolom> Sounds exciting !!!! I'll keep an eye open and will test on my iGadgets ;-)
[02:24:50] <_|Nix|_> OK ... tests are good ... *gulp* ... here goes ...
[02:25:43] <_|Nix|_> OK ... may the Force be with us all ...

[02:27:09] <agcolom> oh yes....
[02:27:23] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Test away ...
[02:27:52] * _|Nix|_ is holding his breath ... turning blue ... turning bluer ... *thud* ...
[02:29:24] <agcolom> ...
[02:29:41] <agcolom> I am getting a back on leaving the popup on iOS
[02:30:13] <agcolom> I have shut down my browser and everything to be sure...
[02:31:59] <_|Nix|_> Oh no ...
[02:32:12] <agcolom> is the change in master already? sometimes it take a few mins...
[02:32:23] <agcolom> Hang on... let me grab an iPAd...
[02:33:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's in master.

[02:33:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We need a way to check the commitid from the main page ...
[02:33:51] <_|Nix|_> Not sure how one would go about adding that though ...
[02:35:32] <agcolom> on the ipad...all good
[02:35:58] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So far so good ...
[02:38:30] <agcolom> yes, all ok on the iPod Touch too now
[02:38:39] <_|Nix|_> Halleluyah!
[02:40:47] <_|Nix|_> It seems testing on Safari/Windoze is a good substitute for iOS ...
[02:41:06] <_|Nix|_> ... except for MauriceG's placement issues ...
[02:42:31] <agcolom> Good.... one tiny easy to fix thing....
[02:43:13] <agcolom> I think you use the width of the collapsible to define the width of the popup container.
[02:43:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Collapsible?
[02:43:37] <agcolom> I thing you should use the heading width (
[02:43:41] <agcolom> yes collapsible
[02:44:03] <_|Nix|_> ... but he was getting the problem with the login form, not the accordion ...
[02:44:57] <agcolom> ui-collapsible-heading is wider by 16px in my case
[02:45:13] <agcolom> ui-collapsible-heading 316px
[02:45:57] <agcolom> ui-popup-container 302 px

[02:46:41] <agcolom> ui-collapsible 300px
[02:47:56] <agcolom> popup form looks perfect for me
[02:49:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe I'll ask MauriceG to reproduce that one ...
[03:01:28] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ did Maurice say on whice device/browser he was experiencing this with?
[03:01:36] <agcolom> which ^
[03:02:34] <agcolom> _Nix|_ sorry, just discovered a very funny bug!
[03:05:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Please, do tell!
[03:06:45] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!

[03:06:46] <agcolom> I need to upload a picture...
[03:07:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ...

[03:18:03] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from agcolom: @agcolom testing http://t.co/URCG59GV ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/Lau3fc
[03:19:18] <agcolom> when I open a popup, I get the overlay... I rotate, and the overlay does not cover the whole screen after rotation. The part that was not displayed when launching the popup is not covered by the overlay.
[03:19:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Aaaah, OK ... I can fix that.
[03:20:22] <agcolom> sorry my description is incorrect
[03:20:36] <agcolom> the screen size is different....
[03:20:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, I check the size of the overlay only when I show it, and not while it's open.
[03:22:30] <agcolom> yes, that's it. it covers the original size, and because now it may be longer because the text wraps differently, the bottom part when going landscape -> portrait or the right part when going the other way has a small piece of screen without overlay.
[03:22:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hwo did you get to that point? Did you start with a small Safari window, and then resize that window?
[03:22:59] <agcolom> it is on hte iPAd and iPod Touch. I did launch the popup and the rotated teh device
[03:24:14] <agcolom> I can reproduce in Safari:
[03:24:28] <agcolom> make your window wide
[03:24:38] <agcolom> launch overlay a popup
[03:24:49] <agcolom> make your safari window narrower
[03:24:59] <agcolom> scroll to the bottom
[03:25:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ...
[03:25:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ... I'm getting it on chrome as well ...
[03:26:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and all this trouble because I'm not using height: 100%; ...
[03:26:23] <agcolom> also in FF
[03:26:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There's never a problem with the width, because that's set to 100% ...
[03:26:40] <agcolom> I see...
[03:26:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I should try setting the height to 100% ...
[03:26:59] <agcolom> what do you set the height to?
[03:28:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Whatever the height of the document at the time the popup appears ...
[03:28:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... but it should be set to 100% in the CSS - of course, it remains to be seen whether that works on all browsers ...
[03:28:55] <agcolom> does it break if you set it to 100%
[03:28:57] <_|Nix|_> Having a height of 100% is notoriously unreliable ...
[03:29:00] <_|Nix|_> Lessee ...
[03:29:24] <agcolom> I've had similar issues with Google maps inside jqm... but I have a trick...
[03:29:37] <agcolom> let me find it... it may help....
[03:30:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It actually seems to work if I cut out the code that calculates the screen height and sets it ...
[03:30:36] <MauriceG> Hi agocolom, Hi _|Nix|_
[03:30:44] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Hey! What's up?
[03:30:52] <agcolom> Hi Maurice...
[03:31:08] <MauriceG> Birthday :-)
[03:31:25] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Is it? Today? Cool! Happy Birthday!
[03:31:41] <MauriceG> Yes, thanks a lot!
[03:32:17] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I'm contemplating removing the code that sets the screen height ... 100% might just work ...
[03:32:26] <_|Nix|_> Needs tons of testing though ....
[03:33:12] <agcolom> In my case I had to set the height of the content div, the page, body and html to 100%
[03:33:20] <MauriceG> I see something else with collapsible in the popup changing orientation on iPhone. _|Nix|_ could you imagine ?
[03:34:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Aaaah, yes ... that's the problem ... if I set the height to 100%, it will be 100% of the document, not 100% of the window.
[03:34:09] <agcolom> but that may not work here as it would be different for all pages, and people may not want their page to be 100%...
[03:34:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, it works nicely on documents that cover more than a page, but it doesn't work on documents that are short.
[03:34:42] <agcolom> yes...
[03:35:12] <agcolom> it was fine for me when I wanted the map to cover 100% of the screen...
[03:35:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, all that remains is for me to listen for resize events and update the height accordingly.
[03:35:26] <agcolom> I suppose so....
[03:35:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: *sigh* ...
[03:35:54] <agcolom> I know, you think you're ready to celebrate and relax.... and "oh no!!!!"
[03:36:24] <agcolom> MauriceG: you've discovered a bug too?
[03:37:15] <MauriceG> cause in landscape the width of the popup is wider than the portrait-screen, rotating to portrait, the hole page-width is resized
[03:40:41] <agcolom> yes I can confirm as well...
[03:41:26] <MauriceG> http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/iospopup2.png
[03:47:37] <MauriceG> agocolom: did I missed something or way every popup close trigger a page-back?
[03:47:45] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ yes and if you go to the top of the page, you can see it's wider than the screen: http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/popup2.png
[03:50:10] <MauriceG> why*
[03:51:27] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Does that happen with every popup that's wider than the portrait screen?
[03:56:10] <agcolom> MauriceG It did for me initially, so I shut down my browser
[03:56:20] <agcolom> then it didn't happen again
[03:56:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I added the code to track the window height. Try to resize it now - should be OK.
[03:57:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The background should cover the window all the time now.
[03:57:17] <agcolom> Where did you change that? I haven't seen a push to master...
[03:57:20] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_ : No. It seems not. The foto popup is nearly resized accordingly the portrait screen width when rotating. Other popups are looking fine.
[03:58:02] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: So maybe there's something wrong with the styling of the accordion popup.
[03:58:11] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Something is forcing its width to be so large.
[03:58:27] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: There may be a min-width hiding in there somewhere.
[03:58:53] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ I don't think you've pushed your change to master
[03:59:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I did: c63796ca6e74448cbf0093c57e0700e307dec315
[03:59:35] <agcolom> on github it seems you have
[03:59:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's the one.
[03:59:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Maybe the branch preview hasn't updated yet.
[03:59:52] <agcolom> but it should come here as wellll
[04:00:17] <agcolom> (you the messages that come here on IRC...)
[04:02:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Oh yeah - the message never showed up ... hmmm ... the hooks may not be working ...
[04:02:06] <agcolom> Fixed on FF
[04:02:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, you /were/ able to test - good!
[04:03:07] <agcolom> yes, but now the window is too big.... hangon
[04:04:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I see it.
[04:04:18] <agcolom> yes, it's a special case...
[04:05:23] <agcolom> if you narrow the window down so much that the menu on the left hand-side goes at the bottom, it seem the height of that menu is added to the height of the page, and you have a long scroll bar that goes well below the footer...
[04:05:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Of course, because the screen is part of the document, so, of course, the document size keeps growing ... I think it needs to take the height of the page ... or the maximum of the height of the page and the height of the window ...
[04:05:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah ...
[04:10:10] <MauriceG> agocolom: the auto go back issue is raised if you deeplink to a popup link (from the browsers history)

[04:11:15] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Give me an example of a link.
[04:11:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Check out the new commit - shouldn't be happening anymore ...
[04:12:05] <agcolom> yes, will try now...
[04:14:11] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_ it seems, this issue is just raised on iOS. If I open a new page and click on a history entry
[04:14:15] <MauriceG> like http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html#&ui-state=dialog
[04:14:35] <MauriceG> all popup close taps raise a history back
[04:15:45] <MauriceG> mmh ... I have to test more ...
[04:17:07] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: OK, that's important, because that's exactly what I've been trying to fix ... also try with dialogs. Open http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#&ui-state=dialog in a new window
[04:17:37] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Then click "Open Dialog" and click the (X) in the dialog.
[04:18:35] <MauriceG> the history back is not triggered, if no history is there. I said wrong before...
[04:18:35] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: I hope I can get my hands on a IOS device really soon - I so need to test these things on there ...
[04:20:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: That's fine. It should never be triggered, so this is a bug.
[04:20:15] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Lemme guess: It happens when you paste in a deep link, right. So, like 1. Go to http://slashdor.org/ 2. Past in the deep link. 3. Open popup. 4. Close popup. 5. You're back at http://slashdot.org/ right?
[04:20:15] <_|Nix|_> s/slashdor/slashdot/
[04:20:15] <_|Nix|_> s/Past/Paste/
[04:21:42] <MauriceG> yes. So it is.
[04:22:16] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: OK, but only on iOS, right? And only with popups?
[04:22:40] <MauriceG> Yes. Safari on Win: no issue
[04:23:48] <MauriceG> FF on Win: no issue
[04:24:03] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: What about dialogs? Do they close OK if you open a deep link?
[04:24:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ I'm not yet getting the updated version... have to wait a bit...
[04:24:48] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: i.e: 1. http://slashdot.org/ 2. http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#&ui-state=dialog; 3. Open dialog. 4. Close dialog ... ?
[04:26:54] <MauriceG> Dialog: no issue
[04:26:54] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: OK, great!
[04:26:58] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: So, at least there's no regression ...
[04:30:30] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: I'm testing it on opera mini emulator on Win this moment
[04:33:56] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: auto go back is not an issue. I always have to tap/click two times to close a popup. But the emulator is may not a reference
[04:34:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Can you please try 1. http://slashdot.org/; 2. http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/index.html#&ui-state=dialog; 3. Open popup 4. Close popup
[04:34:16] <_|Nix|_> ?
[04:34:22] <_|Nix|_> ... on your iOS device?
[04:34:28] <_|Nix|_> Don't be surprised if it's slow.
[04:34:38] <_|Nix|_> I added debug stuff that requires lots of traffic.
[04:37:12] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  no, no.  double-click-to-close-popup-issue -> just on opera mini emulator
[04:37:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: I'm interested in close-popup-goes-back on IOS.
[04:37:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Please test that with the above 4 steps!
[04:39:24] <MauriceG> I've done.  No issue ...  no auto back
[04:39:55] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Then where did you see the issue? I haven't fixed anything :)
[04:40:05] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Maybe the slowdown is the problem ...
[04:40:20] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: I'll try to speed up the debugging ...
[04:40:44] <MauriceG> I see this issue on latest...
[04:41:47] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is too complicated ... I need to get an iOS device and test it myself ... however, I can try to make one improvement to the debug that will make it faster ...
[04:42:21] <_|Nix|_> Are you trying again>
[04:42:22] <_|Nix|_> ?
[04:42:48] <MauriceG> Now I've got it. On second open close
[04:43:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Excellent!
[04:43:42] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: I'll try to speed it up.
[04:43:49] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: ... so we can debug better ...
[04:44:13] <MauriceG> I stop testing on that page?
[04:45:02] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ overlay resize issue is fixed :-) well done ;-)
[04:45:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Awesome!
[04:45:58] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Yes, please ... I'll speed up the debugging a bit, and I'll add some more debug statements and then we can try again.
[04:46:26] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: ok
[04:47:56] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Thanks for testing! I hope to have an iOS device soon, so I can test these things myself ... my boss promised to get me one ...
[05:00:42] <MauriceG> That's fine!
[05:01:11] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_  Safari on Mac: same issue ...

[07:46:43] <agcolom> Yes, it's all getting complicated ;-) but I've learnt a great deal about timezones!
[07:47:10] <agcolom> and my Geography skills are much better too....
[07:48:41] <agcolom> You've missed a good testing session on popups.... lots of bugs got fixed this morning (well when you were asleep ;-) )
[07:49:36] <agcolom> That's what is magic about timezones... Things happen when we sleep... usually good things....
[07:49:51] <TehShrike|Work> Time zones are evil, UTC ftw!
[07:50:18] <agcolom> Sorry Guys, we have to go by GMT!
[07:52:28] <TehShrike|Work> Nah, GMT uses DST, so it's evil too

[11:49:21] <johnbender> agcolom: America - fuck yah
[11:49:37] * johnbender is joking
[11:49:51] <johnbender> I love my country enough to make fun of it
[11:50:37] <johnbender> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcmuPc8_SWQ
[11:50:42] <agcolom> johnbender I never know whether to say America or US or USA.... What is the right way?
[11:50:49] <johnbender> agcolom: USA
[11:51:17] <agcolom> thx :-)
[11:51:19] <johnbender> america is technically disrespectful to the tons of other countries that are part of the americas
[11:51:56] <johnbender> agcolom: ie JasonDScott's Canada
[11:51:57] <agcolom> here the English get very upset of being called British...
[11:52:02] <johnbender> orly?
[11:53:30] <agcolom> orly?? Is that someone? (It is a French Airport in Paris)
[11:54:01] <johnbender> agcolom: orly == Oh Really?
[11:54:03] <agcolom> Maybe I'm just going mad... It's been a looooong day....
[11:54:12] <agcolom> Sorry!!!!!
[11:54:14] <johnbender> agcolom: http://www.bay-of-fundie.com/img/2010/orly-owl2.jpg
[11:54:18] <johnbender> it's a meme
[11:54:23] <johnbender> I'm lame like that
[11:54:30] <agcolom> I love it!!!!
[11:55:02] <agcolom> if gseguin sees what I've said about orly....
[11:55:19] <MauriceG_> _|Nix|_ tested on babulina: first popup open - close: fine!  - popups stop working then. Buttons get animated - no popup is shown right now
[11:56:24] <gseguin> JasonDScott: you cherry pick the merge commit with the -m 1 option
[11:57:35] <gseguin> agcolom: funny
[11:57:40] <agcolom> Right I need to learn git and I need to learn american expressions and acronyms!
[11:57:40] <johnbender> gseguin: JasonDScott: or do a `git log --graph` and find the actual commit that isn't the merge commit
[11:58:00] <johnbender> agcolom: definitely the former, feel free to skip the later
[11:58:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I think finding the actual commit is a bit safer but either way
[11:58:51] <gseguin> not if your cherry-picking a pull request
[11:59:07] <johnbender> gseguin: ah, with many possible commits
[11:59:09] <johnbender> very true
[11:59:38] <agcolom> btw, in the past to be safe I have done the following:
[12:00:07] <agcolom> merge PR 1 cherry pick commit x (for PR1)
[12:00:10] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG_: With every browser?
[12:00:24] <agcolom> merge PR2 cherry pick commit y (for PR2)
[12:00:44] <agcolom> if they are on 2 different files, can I merge PR1 merge PR2
[12:01:00] <agcolom> and then cherry-pick x, cherry-pick y
[12:01:03] <agcolom> ?
[12:06:19] <agcolom> johnbeder: what do you think about adding an entry in the Readme to mention checking device bugs at  https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs before assuming it is a JQM bug?
[12:06:48] <johnbender> agcolom: sure
[12:06:55] <johnbender> agcolom: one sec let me add an issue for notes like this

[13:48:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://goo.gl/rFYkp
[13:49:20] <agcolom> go
[13:49:28] <agcolom> I'm on
[13:49:38] <agcolom> default popup...
[13:49:54] <agcolom> slide page and popup on top
[13:50:00] <agcolom> move out
[13:50:08] <agcolom> slide, popup gone
[13:50:24] <agcolom> one more?
[13:54:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hold on.
[13:55:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I see nothing wrong - this transition may be something opera mini is doing, because it thinks the page has changed completely ... no idea ...
[13:56:03] <agcolom> yes, that's possible....
[14:02:52] <agcolom> That slide transition seems to be standard on Opera mini...
[14:04:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mini/
[14:05:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: This opera mini does not look so different from what I have on my phone ...
[14:06:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: But yeah - wow! That's evil!
[14:06:53] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Woah! What does it look like when you open a menu and then click another menu?
[14:07:07] <agcolom> yes
[14:07:25] <agcolom> exactly perfectly what I see.
[14:07:39] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'm glad I'm not using /that/ browser - yuck!
[14:08:32] <toddparker> Opera mobile and mini are very different _|Nix|_ and agcolom
[14:08:57] <toddparker> mobile os more like a normal browser, mini is a proxy based browser that sends pre-rendered images of the screen
[14:09:25] <toddparker> mini has a built-in slide transition, yes
[14:10:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Have you seen http://jquerymobile.com/branches/custom-select-via-popup/docs/forms/selects/custom.html
[14:10:33] <toddparker> btw - we're down to 439 issues. jasper has been on a tear
[14:10:47] <toddparker> nope _|Nix|_
[14:10:49] <toddparker> looking...
[14:10:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Aside from the obvious bug where the page jumps back to y = 0, the menus tend to be a lot narrower.
[14:11:52] <toddparker> that scroll jump is really odd
[14:11:57] <toddparker> that is a regression
[14:12:03] <agcolom> toddparker: have you had time to look at the "donation" page in Wordpress?
[14:12:06] <toddparker> is this using popup or the original code?
[14:12:14] <toddparker> ah, not yet agcolom
[14:12:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I dunno quite how to handle that. The custom select menu popup was set up to be very wide, which made it necessary to have a max-width to prevent it from going off the screen. The popup has the opposite feature/problem/property: It's as wide as it absolutely needs to be.
[14:12:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, popup-based menus will tend to be narrower than they currently are.
[14:12:49] <toddparker> i see
[14:13:02] <toddparker> so this uses popup
[14:13:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'll fix the jump - NP, but I dunno what to do about the appearance.
[14:13:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah.
[14:13:14] <toddparker> we can set a win-width on them
[14:13:23] <toddparker> maybe 200px or so
[14:13:30] <toddparker> of 160?
[14:13:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK ... sure ...
[14:13:37] <toddparker> a good start anyway
[14:13:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Earlier, the max-width was 350px ...
[14:14:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, they all tended to be 350px ...
[14:14:12] <toddparker> i see
[14:14:17] <toddparker> that seems way too wide tho
[14:14:24] <toddparker> on mobile these fit
[14:14:29] <toddparker> which is narrower than that
[14:14:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But, of course, that's no good for a min-width, because it'll go off the screen in portrait.
[14:14:35] <toddparker> ya
[14:14:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, so ... 160px?
[14:14:50] <toddparker> agcolom: what is the page in WP?
[14:14:57] <toddparker> let's start around there
[14:15:02] <toddparker> 160, 180
[14:15:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Sure ...
[14:15:37] <agcolom> I think you're on it :-)
[14:16:14] <toddparker> i am, just found it
[14:16:16] <toddparker> sorry
[14:16:42] <toddparker> oh nice
[14:17:14] <toddparker> let me fill this out a bit
[14:17:16] <toddparker> looks good

[14:58:42] <agcolom> well funny enough I've always thought the new jqm 1.2 release is going to be a "sexy" release...
[14:58:58] <johnbender> haha
[14:59:05] <johnbender> fair enough

[15:19:28] <agcolom> ok... bedtime for me.... goodnight everyone...
[15:20:26] <agcolom> johnbender btw so nice to see a CV in Latex! I still write my exam paper in latex, but I've been banned from using it for course handbooks :-(
[15:21:23] <johnbender> orly?
[15:21:28] <johnbender> I'm enjoying it
[15:21:37] <johnbender> produces amazing results
[15:22:07] <agcolom> yes, exactly!!!! not like word who tried ot be clever and destroys all your nice presentation...
[15:22:40] <agcolom> and I could do all 4 handbooks in one go.. no need to duplicate uni regulations etc...
[15:22:40] <johnbender> yah I think it's a lot easier for the application to deal with people who know how to use a markup language
[15:23:21] <johnbender> that is, it can expect a lot more form it's users
[15:23:50] <agcolom> it is so logical... does everything for you....
[15:24:26] <agcolom> soem people are afraid of what they don't know... and that's a REAL problem....
[15:24:51] <agcolom> do you then produce pdf or ps?
[15:25:30] <johnbender> agcolom: yah
[15:25:34] <johnbender> pdflatex
[15:25:55] <johnbender> it was super easy to get setup on linux since almost everything is installed with the tex-live distribution
[15:26:10] <johnbender> the math stuff was a sepereate package (diagrams and things) but otherwise super painless
[15:26:25] <johnbender> *separate
[15:28:27] <agcolom> yes... I use it on solaris... my partner installed it at the university... i still use both pdflatex and latex to produce ps files... then the great thing with mac is they convert automatically to pdf... The quality is really good as well..
[15:29:40] <johnbender> emacs has a fairly stunted mode but it does what I need, C-c C-b to compile the buffer and C-c C-v to view it in evince
[15:29:47] <johnbender> makes for a fairly quick itteration cycle
[15:30:55] <agcolom> ah, I'll have to try. I use emacs as well but then I use either pdflatex or latex... then dvips with the options...
[15:31:05] <agcolom> (in the command line)
[15:32:05] <johnbender> agcolom: it
[15:32:12] <johnbender> will probably just work depending
[15:32:18] <agcolom> yes I've seen you're doing a PhD... Latex is really ideal for writing your thesis
[15:32:26] <johnbender> there are a few things I had to customize to get it to do the intermediate in pdf
[15:32:38] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm not a candidate yet
[15:32:43] <johnbender> I'm applying in December
[15:32:53] <johnbender> I'm marshalling my contacts and work though
[15:32:58] <agcolom> Ah... I thought you were doing it now...
[15:33:00] <johnbender> so we'll see
[15:33:01] <johnbender> oh no
[15:33:02] <johnbender> lol
[15:33:05] <johnbender> man I wish
[15:33:10] * johnbender dreams of doing research
[15:34:16] <agcolom> so fingers crossed then ;-)
[15:34:27] <agcolom> Goodnight...
[16:46:38] <LakWork> what's the expected behavior when jquery mobile encounters a 302 redirect?
