[06:21:13] <arschmitz> hey i know there were some open slider issues know what happened to them cant seem to find them?
[06:21:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: slider or rangeslider?
[06:21:37] <arschmitz> rangeslider
[06:21:54] <uGoMobi> I think I added a rangeslider label
[06:22:08] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Rangeslider&milestone=&page=1&state=open
[06:22:15] <uGoMobi> 2 open issues
[06:22:31] <arschmitz> yeah thought so weird im not geting the label
[06:22:37] <arschmitz> but i can see it on those issues
[06:22:40] <uGoMobi> doing triage and bug fixes today and tomorrow
[06:22:53] <uGoMobi> will add label if I run into other rangeslider issues
[06:23:24] <arschmitz> ohh they have no milestone and i was sorted to 1.3.1
[06:23:25] <uGoMobi> that's weird indeed
[06:23:32] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:24:12] <uGoMobi> we also have that issue with the download builder
[06:24:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:24:20] <uGoMobi> doesn't work if you only select rangeslider
[06:24:36] <uGoMobi> maybe gseguin can give that a look
[06:24:42] <arschmitz> was it a dependancy issue?
[06:24:47] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[06:24:49] <arschmitz> i remember the issue but not details
[06:25:14] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/35
[06:26:45] <arschmitz> ah ok 
[06:26:55] <arschmitz> just needs better css scoping it sounds like
[06:29:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well that probably doesn't resolve the original issue
[06:30:41] <uGoMobi> that was about when you select more than just the rangeslider in the DB
[06:31:06] <uGoMobi> if you only select the rangeslider you don't get it at all

[07:20:59] <gseguin> toddmparker: wo what's left to do for the release of 1.3.1?
[07:21:22] <gseguin> s/wo/so/
[07:21:42] <toddmparker> morning all
[07:21:45] <toddmparker> i was just going to ask you all about that
[07:22:01] <toddmparker> i've been going thru the 1.3.1 issues and moving stuff out to 1.3.2 and 1.4.0
[07:22:12] <frequent> morning
[07:23:14] <gseguin> toddmparker: I'm expecting to have to deal with bugs in the grunt deploy tasks but it shouldn't be too bad
[07:24:28] <toddmparker> gseguin: ah, right
[07:25:03] <toddmparker> can you all help me by winnowing this list down to the few things we think we can get done in the next day or two and that are really critical - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=23&state=open
[07:25:11] <toddmparker> i move a bunch out already
[07:25:29] <uGoMobi> hey all
[07:25:39] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: i don't remember seeing that early fix to eliminate the duplicate form elements
[07:25:47] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[07:25:59] <toddmparker> doing some 1.3.1 planning
[07:26:11] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[07:26:17] <uGoMobi> yeah I noticed
[07:27:16] <uGoMobi> just changed the milestone of 2 issues back to 1.3.1 because I am about to fix them
[07:27:32] <gseguin> I'll be back in 15

[07:31:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that adding hidden form elements issue was fixed before 1.3 final
[07:33:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: there was another form issue that was fixed right after 1.3.0 release though
[07:35:38] <uGoMobi> that was this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5655
[07:37:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: oh, ok
[07:37:52] <toddmparker> think that was in my changelog
[07:38:29] <toddmparker> checking...
[07:39:41] <toddmparker> yep, that's in there
[07:40:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sorry i i moved those issues…did I?
[07:40:22] <toddmparker> I was using the github issue app on my phone for triage. works really well
[07:40:38] <uGoMobi> that's ok, you couldn't know I was fixing them right now :)
[07:40:51] <toddmparker> no psychic connection
[07:41:00] <uGoMobi> hey cool, never used that app
[07:41:05] <uGoMobi> will try
[07:41:16] <toddmparker> i think the biggest thing i'd like to get in is refresh for panels and tables
[07:41:29] <toddmparker> if we think that's acceptable, version-wise
[07:42:30] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: removing 1.3.1 from this issue = unconfirmed

[07:45:58] <asheppard> hi all
[07:46:06] <asheppard> so i've been building offline-capable web apps with mustache and azicchetti/jquerymobile-router

[07:46:19] <asheppard> using requirejs for dependencies, which is working great
[07:46:45] <asheppard> but jqm router uses mobileinit to set things up
[07:47:01] <asheppard> which means it must load before jquery mobile
[07:47:06] <asheppard> but after jquery
[07:47:20] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:47:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Git build #4966: FIXED in 1 min 26 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Git/4966/
[07:47:21] <doesallmagic> mail: Panel: Unset transform translate3d for FF where possible. Fixes #5753.
[07:47:49] <asheppard> so i ended up patching jquery mobile with a dependency on router
[07:48:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i was just going to ask about that FF issue. nice
[07:48:55] <toddmparker> asheppard: this channel is for the dev team, not support.
[07:49:02] <toddmparker> mind trying the #jquery channel?
[07:49:30] <asheppard> i'm bringing it up here as i was wondering if something like router could be included in jquery mobile proper
[07:49:59] <asheppard> and if not, perhaps i would work to get jqm router less dependent on mobileinit
[07:50:58] <toddmparker> Including it isn't in the plan for the near future, but working with the folks on the router plugin to improve it is a great idea
[07:51:42] <gseguin> asheppard: doesn't that work: https://gist.github.com/gseguin/1f2decce2f0fb6c602f9 ?
[07:52:13] <asheppard> @gseguin sure, but i want to build a single file
[07:52:30] <asheppard> with all my deps baked in
[07:52:50] <asheppard> i don't think i can do that with nested require (haven't tried recently)
[07:52:52] <gseguin> asheppard: you can run r.js on that
[07:53:08] <asheppard> hmm... i'll give it a go
[07:53:41] <asheppard> any initial pointers on why router would need to use mobileinit?
[07:55:52] <toddmparker> because anything that changes global config options or modifies the library needs to spin up first and hook into mobileinit to do so
[07:57:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4826#issuecomment-15524372 -- if that's still an issue we can probably only fix it by making markup changes, Changing the milestone from 1.3.2 --> 1.4
[07:58:38] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ok. i wasn't sure if it was just a target mismatch issue like we had with vclick
[08:05:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: the demo autocomplete seems to 404 a lot now
[08:05:32] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/forms/
[08:05:38] <toddmparker> search for "panels"
[08:05:52] <toddmparker> we should patch this up for 1.3.1
[08:06:13] <toddmparker> used to work ok but maybe after the switch to view. things got odd
[08:06:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:07:11] <toddmparker> odd tho
[08:07:18] <uGoMobi> I see the issue
[08:07:25] <arschmitz> must be something in the directory structure 
[08:07:37] <uGoMobi> the url got "docs" in it instead of "demos"
[08:07:45] <arschmitz> oh that will do it
[08:07:53] <toddmparker> ah-ha
[08:08:09] <uGoMobi> we renamed the folder and probably forgot to change this in the code somewhere
[08:08:12] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so ff uses unprefixed properties now so that fix may not work
[08:08:33] <uGoMobi> hmm
[08:08:44] <uGoMobi> did they just switch?
[08:09:30] <gseguin> oops
[08:09:34] <uGoMobi> if Android and iOS still use the prefixed property I can change the unprefixed as well
[08:09:48] <toddmparker> worth checking
[08:10:03] <asheppard> gseguin: the other issue with nested require is that i have other modules that depend directly on jqm, so it's hard to guarantee any specific load order
[08:10:04] <asheppard> (esp. now that the 'priority' config no longer exists)
[08:10:32] <asheppard> i'll take a look at improving router and get back to you
[08:10:45] <uGoMobi> but then again... how do we know if they don't switch after our release
[08:10:48] <toddmparker> thanks asheppard 
[08:10:51] <gseguin> asheppard: not sure I understand what you're saying
[08:10:54] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right.
[08:10:57] <toddmparker> it's a mess
[08:11:24] <uGoMobi> asheppard: just had another look at your PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5530
[08:11:46] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of just include margins in the calculation
[08:11:50] <asheppard> @uGoMobi yeah i need to update that
[08:11:54] <gseguin> if you have dependencies on jqm then that code should go in the inner require callback
[08:12:41] <asheppard> gseguin: i have some standalone modules that provide various extensions to jqm
[08:13:04] <asheppard> i include those modules and my router stuff in the final app
[08:13:12] <gseguin> do they have an explicit dependency on jquery.mobile?
[08:13:27] <asheppard> yes, for various reasons
[08:13:36] <asheppard> though i could cheat and reference $.mobile i suppose
[08:13:52] <gseguin> then you can require them along with jquery.mobile in that gist that I sent you earlier
[08:14:27] <gseguin> asheppard: we export $.mobile as our module
[08:15:01] <gseguin> so you can do: require( [ "jquery.mobile" ], function( jqm ) {} );
[08:15:11] <asheppard> by cheating i mean that i could require(['jquery']) knowing that the .mobile object would be assigned eventually
[08:15:15] <gseguin> and use jqm instead of $.mobile

[08:18:36] <asheppard> uGoMobi: at least when above the "desktop" breakpoint
[08:19:04] <gseguin> asheppard: jquery.mobile has an explicit dependency on jquery
[08:19:55] <uGoMobi> asheppard: isn't it easier to just override it in your CSS: .ui-page { min-height: auto !important; }
[08:20:47] <asheppard> uGoMobi: i thought i tried that but i will look again - does !important override explicit styles?
[08:21:07] <asheppard> uGoMobi: i thought explicit styles always won
[08:21:20] <frequent> asheppard: not sure, but can't you just set JQM global-autoinit to false on mobileinit, wait until require has loaded router etc and when everything is on board, trigger JQM manually. Works for me (not using router though).
[08:21:59] <uGoMobi> asheppard: it should
[08:22:12] <asheppard> gseguin: i know, i'm just saying that if i want to do "regular" jquery stuff in a module as well as jqm stuff, i require them both even though i know $.mobile exists
[08:22:46] <asheppard> but knowing $.mobile exists would be a way around my dep issues

[08:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> Why are there so many page events that aren't widget events?
[09:13:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez they are part of navigation
[09:13:56] <arschmitz> but its something we are looking at for 1.4
[09:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> They're not part of the page widget?
[09:14:07] <arschmitz> no
[09:14:20] <arschmitz> the page widget does almost nothing right now
[09:14:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez: I assume you're talking about the events?
[09:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:14:50] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: yes, nav is the garbage dump of functionality 
[09:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[09:14:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I should say "was"
[09:15:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: hopefully we'll get toward rearranging some of that in 1.4
[09:15:29] <johnbender> but we have _a lot_ of refactoring to do
[09:15:36] <johnbender> we're trying to be incremental about it
[09:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:16:55] <arschmitz> moving some of them to the page widget is something we have discussed also
[09:17:03] <arschmitz> but not sure whats going to happen yet 
[09:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just stood out as odd when I was looking at how many standalone events Mobile has.
[09:18:31] <arschmitz> yeah its something thats being looked at for sure
[09:21:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: I would wait
[09:21:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: if we move to many containers
[09:21:45] <johnbender> the event won't be a page*
[09:21:52] <johnbender> it might be a container*
[09:21:57] <johnbender> (possible)
[09:22:00] <arschmitz> yeah i just meant events in general
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> and how they are dumped into nav
[09:22:13] <arschmitz> are being looked at
[09:22:14] <johnbender> haven't thought about it too deeply
[09:22:32] <johnbender> yes, definitely need to get rethought
[09:22:41] <arschmitz> johnbender: you and i already had at least one discussion about it
[09:22:46] <johnbender> yarp
[09:23:03] <arschmitz> so i was just saying basicly its on the radar but no answer in sight yet
[09:23:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker _|Nix|_ I'm going to start in on the transition handlers refactor unless there are objections
[09:23:13] <johnbender> shouldn't be too crazy
[09:23:19] <toddmparker> cool
[09:23:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: good way to frame it
[09:23:40] <arschmitz> johnbender: sounds good to me a good place to start
[09:23:41] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm going to aim to unit test the shit out of if as an example
[09:23:48] <johnbender> it's low hanging fruit
[09:23:52] <johnbender> plain js objects
[09:24:12] <johnbender> rather, it *will* be plain js objects
[09:24:23] <arschmitz> yeah really need to push things into objects that can be easily tested / extended
[09:25:44] <arschmitz> a good side effect too is a lot of feature requests can be answered with well write a custom extension and you will be good to go lol
[09:26:04] <arschmitz> that way we support less but make more possible
[09:27:11] <johnbender> gseguin: you around?

[09:32:15] <uGoMobi> yippie :)
[09:32:21] <gseguin> johnbender: I am
[09:32:31] <gseguin> johnbender: what's up?
[09:32:41] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get anywhere with the split to unit tests?
[09:33:03] <gseguin> I'll push my local branch
[09:33:11] <johnbender> gseguin: how far along are you
[09:33:16] <johnbender> I'm wondering if I can just merge and move on with life
[09:33:28] <johnbender> gseguin: that is merge and then progress as necessary

[09:33:57] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06tests-separation 14eda8efe 15Ghislain Seguin: Tests: split unit and integration tests (WIP)
[09:33:57] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06tests-separation 141fb81b2 15Ghislain Seguin: Tests: split unit and integration tests (WIP)
[09:34:43] <gseguin> johnbender: what needs to happen is adding a testing target for the integration tests
[09:35:29] <johnbender> gseguin: is that it?
[09:35:47] <gseguin> johnbender: nope
[09:36:12] <johnbender> gseguin: it's hard to tell from the diffs what exactly is done and not done 
[09:36:43] <johnbender> gseguin: alternately I can just create a tests/unit/ directory and when the merge happens there isn't likely to be a conflict
[09:36:44] <gseguin> johnbender: there is still navigation and dialog
[09:36:47] <gseguin> to do
[09:36:48] <johnbender> since we don't really have transition tests
[09:37:00] <johnbender> gseguin: can't we just move those into integration 
[09:37:11] <johnbender> ?
[09:37:15] <gseguin> johnbender: not all of them
[09:37:24] <gseguin> you said some are unit tests
[09:37:39] <gseguin> I just could not figure it out so I left it alone
[09:38:13] <gseguin> was going to get back to it but if you have time that would be great as you're much more familiar with those than I
[09:38:31] <johnbender> gseguin: those test are all integration 
[09:38:40] <johnbender> gseguin: or close enough that I don't mind doing it wholesale
[09:38:44] <gseguin> then let's move them
[09:38:58] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'll move them over then work on a test target
[09:39:12] <johnbender> that way when people start refactoring they have somewhere to put unit tests
[09:40:25] <gseguin> yup
[09:41:17] <johnbender> gseguin: we can move them over as necessary
[09:41:36] <johnbender> gseguin: actually I'm just going to setup the build target and then merge
[09:41:43] <johnbender> I'll move them on master as necessary
[09:42:03] <gseguin> ok
[09:42:28] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm doing some minor adjustments to the build system to prepare for release of 1.3.1
[09:46:39] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm ok
[09:46:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I was actually going to ask now that I've looked at it
[09:47:07] <johnbender> gseguin: should I created another target or just provide an option for isolating unit/integration tests
[09:47:23] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like qunit:http is fairly closed
[09:47:45] <johnbender> that is
[09:47:55] <johnbender> we need to use qunit:http it's just a matter of what urls we hand it
[09:48:23] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah that needs some refactoring 
[09:49:05] <gseguin> we might want to add a test.js in build/tasks
[09:49:26] <gseguin> and have test:unit and test:integration
[09:49:35] <gseguin> as well as test:all
[09:49:49] <gseguin> and test being an alias for test:unit
[09:50:02] <gseguin> johnbender: what do you think?
[09:50:49] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what I had in mind
[09:51:11] <johnbender> would they just set the url config for qunit:http depending?
[09:51:11] <gseguin> ok good
[09:51:44] <gseguin> johnbender: pretty much
[09:51:51] <johnbender> gseguin: I looked at the code again and the urls isn't a callback it's just a function invocation
[09:52:04] <gseguin> it is indeed
[09:52:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought it was a callback, and thus my comment about it being "closed"
[09:52:29] <gseguin> that function needs to be moved as a shared function that receives the type in param
[09:52:42] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'll set up something and you can give it the thumbs
[09:52:48] <gseguin> k
[09:52:54] <gseguin> thanks 
[09:53:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#153 (1.3-stable - 8c82cb5 : Ghislain Seguin): The build was fixed.
[09:53:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/1503d8eb119a...8c82cb5100bf
[09:53:21] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/5844381
[09:53:50] <johnbender> gseguin: how can task A that is depended on by task B check the type of task B
[09:54:24] <gseguin> johnbender: say what?
[09:54:25] <johnbender> gseguin: is that part of the grunt.options object?
[09:54:44] <johnbender> gseguin: test:unit will depend on some config task and qunit:http right?
[09:55:03] <gseguin> oh
[09:55:24] <gseguin> hmm
[09:55:27] <johnbender> so the config task needs to know that it's being run as a result of test:unit being invoked
[09:55:32] <johnbender> I had this problem before
[09:55:44] <johnbender> not sure if there's some obvious way to do it
[09:55:49] <gseguin> so you can do something like:
[09:55:53] <johnbender> otherwise there's always flags
[09:56:19] <johnbender> --type=unit|integration|all(default)
[09:56:50] <gseguin> grunt.registerTask( "test:unit", [ "test:_setUnit", "qunit:http" ] );
[09:57:56] <johnbender> gseguin: seems like flags actually work quite well here if you're not totally opposed
[09:58:04] <gseguin> and the _setUnit task will set a var in the scope of the test.js module whih will be consumed by that refactored function
[09:58:25] <johnbender> --type=unit[,integration]|all
[09:58:32] <gseguin> not opposed
[09:58:58] <johnbender> gseguin: ok let me try that
[09:59:04] <johnbender> should be pretty quick
[09:59:07] <johnbender> we can always revert
[09:59:16] <gseguin> k
[10:28:47] <Krinkle> gseguin: What kind of trouble are you having with qunit's phantomjs on OSX? Works fine for me
[10:29:20] <Krinkle> gseguin: by qunit's phantomjs I presume you mean grunt, not qunit? (e.g. grunt-contrib-qunit > grunt-lib-phantpmjs)
[10:29:57] <gseguin> Krinkle: after I do a fresh npm install and then a grunt test
[10:30:03] <gseguin> I get an error message
[10:30:09] * gseguin tries to retrieve it
[10:30:11] <Krinkle> press the any key
[10:30:18] <Krinkle> ;-)
[10:30:41] <Krinkle> brb in 20 min. I'll look for (a link to) the error message from you then
[10:33:17] <gseguin> Krinkle: http://pastebin.com/tzMWBgdc
[10:34:12] <gseguin> Krinkle: after that I have to manually go to node_modules/grunt-contrib-qunit/node_modules/grunt-lib-phantomjs
[10:34:35] <gseguin> Krinkle: and do: `npm install phantomjs@1.8.1-3`
[10:34:47] <gseguin> only then it works
[10:41:00] <Krinkle> gseguin: Can you look at the output after that last command and see which .zip it downloads? 
[10:41:18] <Krinkle> (instead of phantomjs-1.8.2-macosx.zip)
[10:43:25] <gseguin> Krinkle: http://pastebin.com/cuECdnuz
[10:51:05] <johnbender> gseguin: <3 units
[10:51:14] <johnbender> gseguin: had to move the setNameSpace up
[10:51:21] <johnbender> but everything seems to be fine
[10:51:24] <johnbender> should be merging soon
[10:51:27] <gseguin> johnbender: cool
[10:51:33] <gseguin> johnbender: question for you
[10:51:44] <johnbender> gseguin: shoot
[10:52:05] <gseguin> why do we have to have the version in the filename when our files already live in a directory that is the version
[10:52:08] <gseguin> ?
[10:52:39] <gseguin> johnbender: do I make sense?
[10:52:54] <johnbender> gseguin: for the deploy?
[10:52:59] <johnbender> I made teh same argument way back wehn
[10:53:12] <johnbender> it's a project convention that we follow from core was the response iirc
[10:53:36] <gseguin> ok
[10:55:06] <johnbender> gseguin: worth bringing up again imo
[11:00:33] <Krinkle> gseguin: Okay, that's odd.
[11:00:36] <Krinkle> gseguin: Do you have homebrew?
[11:00:44] <gseguin> Krinkle: I do
[11:01:17] <Krinkle> gseguin: Do you have phantomjs installed globally via npm?
[11:01:37] <Krinkle> Assuming not, try installing phantomjs through homebrew and see if that does work properly
[11:02:11] <Krinkle> Nevermind
[11:02:22] <Krinkle> I didn't look at the bottom of your initial paste
[11:02:31] <Krinkle> It doens't even try to run PhantomJS
[11:02:41] <Krinkle> It can't find the local dependency
[11:02:47] <Krinkle> I'd file a bug against grunt-contrib-qunit
[11:02:47] <gseguin> well it tries but it's not there
[11:03:12] <gseguin> ok will do
[11:03:28] <Krinkle> gseguin: I see the npm install output and the problem is that it isn't creating the bin link
[11:03:40] <gseguin> exactly
[11:03:53] <Krinkle> gseguin: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit/issues/26
[11:04:26] <gseguin> alright so I'm not the only one
[11:04:30] <gseguin> Thanks Krinkle 
[11:05:16] <Krinkle> I had the same issue a few months back. Not sure what solved it, but one of the things I did between the two points is upgrading npm and node.
[11:05:30] <Krinkle> gseguin: node --version && npm --version
[11:05:51] <gseguin> Krinkle: v0.8.22
[11:05:57] <gseguin> Krinkle: 1.2.14

[13:17:19] <johnbender> gseguin: next step is to put a moratorium on integration tests
[13:17:34] <johnbender> gseguin: I was thinking something like "no integration tests unless you can convince me otherwise"
[13:17:57] <johnbender> although the subtlety of what goes where probably isn't clear to most folks
[13:18:35] <gseguin> johnbender: I agree, no more integration tests
[13:18:50] <gseguin> too hard to maintain too
[13:18:52] <johnbender> gseguin: grunt test --types=unit,integration
[13:19:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I think they serve an important purpose
[13:19:10] <gseguin> what's the default ?
[13:19:12] <johnbender> but we need fewer of them
[13:19:21] <johnbender> gseguin: --types=unit,integration
[13:19:28] <johnbender> that's the default
[13:19:40] <gseguin> for travis can we just run unit ?
[13:19:46] <johnbender> gseguin: there are somethings we won't be able to test otherwise without a gigantic amount of effort
[13:19:46] <gseguin> so it's faster?
[13:19:57] <johnbender> gseguin: the whole nav suite is integration
[13:20:00] <johnbender> so no :)
[13:20:09] <gseguin> hmm ok
[13:20:23] <johnbender> gseguin: that's always the first thing that breaks
[13:20:31] <johnbender> unit tests give you a better sense of what is actually broken
[13:20:37] <johnbender> integration tests are less fragile
[13:20:40] <johnbender> it's a sliding scale
[13:20:46] <johnbender> "less fragile"
[13:20:50] <johnbender> generally speaking
[13:21:04] <johnbender> I'm generalizing to projects where the preferred platform isn't totally fucked 
[13:21:07] <johnbender> lolol

[14:12:47] <gseguin> heh, it only gets better they say
[14:39:15] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm thinking putting the real version "pre" in $.mobile.version even for git builds
[14:39:33] <gseguin> johnbender: and add a commitHash attribute
[14:39:43] <gseguin> or something in the like
[14:40:04] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: ^ thoughts
[14:51:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: +1
[14:51:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Might look ugly on the front page though.
[14:52:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe the nice, 7 digit git hash.
[15:01:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah I'll take the short SHA
[15:03:53] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the goal?
[15:18:59] <gseguin> johnbender: have the human readable version available event in the git build
[15:19:23] <johnbender> gseguin: "available" where?
[15:19:34] <gseguin> in $.mobile
[15:19:52] <johnbender> gseguin: and what about the sha?
[15:19:57] <gseguin> same
[15:20:10] <gseguin> $.mobile.commitHash
[15:20:18] <gseguin> or something like that
[15:20:24] <gseguin> ( naming is hard )
[15:22:11] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm wondering what the value of the commit hash is on the mobile object?
[15:22:14] <johnbender> value / purpose
[15:22:23] * johnbender steps fully into the bike shed to look around
[15:23:03] <gseguin> johnbender: I guess that's true
[15:52:19] <gseguin> johnbender: any preference for the banner in the unminified version?
[15:52:30] <gseguin> http://pastebin.com/eRSPHAsc is what I'm working on
[15:52:49] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks beautiful
[15:52:54] <johnbender> your mother would be proud
[15:53:44] <gseguin> :D
[15:53:57] <gseguin> be back in 10
[16:01:20] <gseguin> other change I'm doing is right now we put the date of the commit in the banner
[16:01:29] <gseguin> I want to put the date of the build
[16:01:51] <gseguin> _|Nix|_, arschmitz, johnbender: objections?
[16:05:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I guess that's OK. The date of the commit is not that useful anyway, since you have the commitid itself.
[16:05:39] <gseguin> exactly
