[13:36:36] <gnarf> am i just missing something?
[13:36:44] <gnarf> data-theme doesn't work on a controlgroup ??
[13:37:43] <gnarf> i gotta say, this theme swatch stuff is really confusing me... which is kinda sad :)
[13:39:26] <gnarf> why can't you just set data-theme on a container?
[13:39:30] <gnarf> or like a controlgroup
[13:39:31] <gnarf> etc
[13:39:37] <gnarf> rather than every frickin button

[14:08:52] <bot-t> (57 mins 50 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell arschmitz That's the one about flattening fixedToolbar and using ._on() for binding event handlers to the closest page.
[14:13:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. The theme inheritance discussion was related to the controlgroup discussion for other reasons - namely, that both the correct enhancement of the controlgroup and the theme inheritance require that we figure out in which order to enhance our widgets. The order dictated by the order in which the widgets hook up to pagecreate to start enhancing themselves is insufficient for guaranteeing that child widgets inherit the them
[14:13:09] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: let me be lazy and file one for me? :)
[14:13:36] <gnarf> cc me on it and ill add some discuss but like - i was just bitching ;)
[14:13:51] * _|Nix|_ sighs heavily and clicks on "New Issue" ...
[14:14:04] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Are you "gnarf" on github as well?
[14:14:25] <gnarf> gnarf37
[14:14:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ah ok couldn't remember wasent one I was really involved with just remembered there being discussion
[14:14:50] <_|Nix|_> Cool ... how do I CC you? Just mention your name inside the body of the report?
[14:14:58] <gnarf> thanks - im in the middle of working on something
[14:15:01] <gnarf> yeah
[14:15:05] <gnarf> just @gnarf37 somewhere
[14:15:07] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[14:15:36] <gnarf> i'll let arschmitz and you champion my opinion ;)
[14:16:42] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5301 at your service.
[14:17:46] <gnarf> quick thought there
[14:17:49] <gnarf> back to work
[14:20:44] <arschmitz> gnarf: Ha ha noprob we will take care of it
[14:20:49] <_|Nix|_> This request actually raises some interesting challenges: When you set the theme option on the controlgroup, it would call _setTheme() which would set the theme and call refresh(), which would in turn have to call refresh() on any children. However, .buttonMarkup()-type children are not widgets and have no refresh method, so controlgroup would have to pick out which of its children are .buttonMarkup() and re-enhance them manually. For

[14:21:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: I'm on my phone let me jump on laptop I reviewed your pr and have an opinion on this also
[14:22:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool.
[14:25:24] <arschmitz> ok so on your pr first i only noticed one minor thing i would change
[14:25:58] <arschmitz> you dont define _thisPage explicitly
[14:26:11] <arschmitz> you allow it to be created as an expando
[14:26:47] <arschmitz> i cant imagine where it would matter but its in the jQuery style guide to never use expandos
[14:28:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats all on that other then that i really like it better code organization and it will detach all the events properly
[14:29:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i really should have done that when i wrote the extension i noticed it then because i was using _on but i dunno i just didnt do it lol
[14:29:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll $.extend {} it from _create ...
[14:29:48] <arschmitz> or you can even just make it a property that is inatially set to null
[14:30:30] <arschmitz> but either way its pretty minor
[14:31:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... if I make it a property, it ends up in the prototype, but I really don't need it in the prototype.
[14:31:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's only needed in the instance.
[14:31:24] <arschmitz> true yeah just extend it
[14:33:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and about the inheritance? You said you had an opinion ...
[14:33:13] <arschmitz> ok so theme inheritance

[14:33:47] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/fixed-toolbar-handlers 0a77560 Gabriel Schulhof: [fixedToolbar] Declaring _thisPage explicitly -- thanks arschmitz
[14:33:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:i think this is another one that is a result of us not using widgets properly.
[14:34:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? How would our using widgets properly fix the theme inheritance?
[14:34:40] <arschmitz> well if button markup was a widget it could be refreshed
[14:35:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Button markup can be refreshed even so. The problem is that you cannot identify that it is buttonMarkup.
[14:35:11] <arschmitz> and then for inheritance the widgets can just look for the closest parent with a theme defined
[14:35:38] <arschmitz> and then no dependance on initalizeation order
[14:35:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, now that you mention it the button widget breaks buttonMarkup's encapsulation by accessing a data item assigned to the buttonMarkup elements by buttonMarkup.
[14:36:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "the widgets can just look for the closest parent with a theme defined" won't work.
[14:36:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sometimes the theme they should inherit is dictated by data-theme, sometimes by data-content-theme.
[14:37:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ahh yeah didnt think about that
[14:37:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, they tend to just look at the parent's ui-body-* class.
[14:37:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... which introduces the enhancement order problem.
[14:37:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah i see
[14:38:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... continuing my thought on the button widget's shenanigans, we could make the controlgroup widget perform the same shenanigans ...
[14:39:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that would work for a control group an solve gnarf's issue
[14:40:10] <arschmitz> it dosent solve the greater issue of theme inheritance but do what we can for now as thats a much bigger issue in general
[14:40:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could select for all the widgets inside the controlgroup using :mobile-button,:mobile-checkboxradio,:mobile-selectmenu (and any others I might've missed) and set the theme on those using .refresh(). Then we'd select all the children and :not() the widget ones. The remainder must be .buttonMarkup(), but we can make sure by checking that they have that data item.
[14:41:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and our work is not yet done, either, because I think even proper widgets do not re-check theme inheritance during refresh().
[14:41:46] <_|Nix|_> So, gnarf's request is actually quite a doozie ...
[14:41:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i like that easy and quick with out overcomplicating it
[14:42:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on the topic of refresh in widgets
[14:42:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was actually looking at 4990 which involves widget refresh
[14:43:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we have widgets that dont even have refresh methods right now
[14:44:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it seems like this is another place like _destroy _on _setOption that we need to review our widgets and make sure they are actually doing their jobs lol
[14:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: your thoughts?
[14:46:19] * _|Nix|_ was reading #4990 as well as the bug referenced from there.
[14:47:00] <_|Nix|_> Huh ... doesn't autoreplace my https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/nnnn when it's an action ...
[14:47:24] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! It does replace it when it contains letters?
[14:47:30] * _|Nix|_ needs to fix his autoreplace.
[14:47:38] <_|Nix|_> Anyway ...
[14:47:48] <arschmitz> yeah i made a quick fix for it last night but grid needs to to be updated too and we talked about moving that to nav so didnt finish it
[14:47:54] <_|Nix|_> navbar definitely could use a refresh, from the sounds of it.
[14:48:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah for sure
[14:49:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: my thought is should we lump all of these into a more generic "review all widgets to conform with ui standards" issue and tag dev tasks for 1.4?
[14:50:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 1.4 of course also begins our converging with ui so it makes sense as a 1.4 dev task
[14:51:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad ... it'd give us a checklist ... we could even edit the issue description and change [ ] something that needs doing to [✓] something that needs doing -- <commitid>
[14:51:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Indeed.
[14:51:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd file that one.
[14:52:04] <arschmitz> cool and this will also probably roll in the option / default list you have going
[14:52:13] <arschmitz> as part of implementing setOption
[14:52:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... we wouldn't want to implement _setOption on some of those crazy options ...
[14:52:55] <arschmitz> exactly those we say this is a default not an option then dont need to support it
[14:53:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, for example, the controlgroups heading ... imagine have to re-evaluate what tags are considered headings ...
[14:53:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah no thanks lol
[14:53:29] <_|Nix|_> s/controlgroups/controlgroup's/ s/have to/having to/
[14:54:21] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... on that cheery note I think I'm'na hit the proverbial hay ... L8R
[14:54:42] <gnarf> i figured this was complex or it would already work ;)
