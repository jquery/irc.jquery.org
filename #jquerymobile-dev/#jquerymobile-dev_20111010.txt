[07:23:41] <toddparker> hi all
[07:25:26] <aaronmcadam> hiya toddparker :)
[07:26:44] <aaronmcadam> filed that new ff 7.0.1 bug :)
[08:27:36] <toddparker> thanks aaronmcadam
[08:27:51] <toddparker> hey kinblas or johnbender
[08:28:10] <aaronmcadam> no problem toddparker!!
[08:28:31] <toddparker> I'm editing the docs page to tweak Bender's info about disabling mobile.pushState.enabled
[08:28:43] <toddparker> does that need to be added here as a global config option? http://localhost:99/jquery-mobile/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[08:29:01] <toddparker> rather: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[08:34:03] <kinblas> toddparker: Yeah, it should be listed there
[08:35:21] <kinblas> toddparker:
[08:35:59] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding that BB sync up ... that's 4pm EST? So 1pm PST?
[08:36:23] <kinblas> toddparker: maybe you could send out an invite so there's no confusion.
[08:37:17] <toddparker> i can ask him to add you guys
[08:40:34] <kinblas> toddparker: is laurent east or west coast canada?
[08:46:30] <toddparker> think east

[08:55:32] <toddparker> replaceState plugin
[08:55:32] <toddparker> For those browsers that support history.replaceState, an additional optional plugin is provided that will convert the hash change urls mentioned in the previous section into the full document path which is cleaner and makes the Ajax tracking transparent in the URL structure. This is built as an enhancement on top of the hash-based URL system for Ajax links. For browsers that do not support history.replaceState, or
[08:55:32] <toddparker> this feature is disabled, hash-based URLs will be used instead. Note that this feature converts hash-based urls by using history.replaceState (not history.pushState) because this works more reliably across our target platforms.
[08:55:33] <toddparker> Since the plugin initializes when the DOM is fully loaded you can enable and disable it manually by setting $.mobile.pushStateEnabled global configuration option to false anytime before document ready.
[08:55:44] <toddparker> And the note after
[08:55:48] <toddparker> Important: rel="external" and $.mobile.ajaxEnabled=false
[08:55:49] <toddparker> Some browsers have finicky implementations of the (push|replace)State api which can cause odd behavior in some cases (most often when returning to a document onto which state has been pushed or replaced). When building a jQuery Mobile application where the ajax navigation is being explicitly disabled regularly, either though the use of rel="external" on links or by disabling Ajax navigation completely via the
[08:55:49] <toddparker> $.mobile.ajaxEnabled=false , we recommend disabling the pushState feature to fall back to the hash based navigation for more consistent behavior.
[08:56:21] <toddparker> // i re-wrote some stuff, but want to make sure this is better and technically accurate
[09:04:40] <toddparker> kinblas or johnbender - thoughts?
[09:05:01] <toddparker> i updated the global config page to add this info too, and linked to this page
[09:05:11] <johnbender> toddparker: I missed the link :(
[09:05:34] <toddparker> it's local
[09:05:41] <toddparker> that's the content from the page
[09:05:47] <toddparker> if it reads ok, i'll add it
[09:07:02] <johnbender> toddparker: did you link here, I joined after you sent the message I think
[09:07:09] <johnbender> "did you link here?"
[09:07:10] <kinblas> toddparker: I wouldn't say finnicky
[09:07:22] <kinblas> I'd say implementations are inconsistent or buggy
[09:07:23] <toddparker> what's better
[09:07:35] <toddparker> and should we be specific about the Safari or Chrome issues?
[09:07:39] <kinblas> finnicky to me means they must be called a certain way
[09:07:47] <kinblas> called/used
[09:07:52] <toddparker> non-standard?
[09:08:01] <toddparker> buggy?
[09:08:02] <kinblas> problem is I think there are gray areas in the spec
[09:08:08] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[09:08:10] <johnbender> what kin said
[09:08:13] <kinblas> and up to the interpretation oflementor
[09:08:19] <kinblas> of implementor
[09:08:21] <kinblas> which is bad
[09:09:07] <johnbender> kinblas: can you paste the link I still don't have it :(
[09:09:22] <toddparker> The diversity of implementations of the (push or replace)State API in various browsers
[09:09:38] <kinblas> johnbender: what link, I was just reading what todd pasted above
[09:09:48] <kinblas> oh
[09:09:49] <kinblas> heh
[09:09:49] <toddparker> bender - I'm editing this section you added here
[09:09:51] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[09:10:00] <johnbender> can you paste again?
[09:10:02] <kinblas> toddparker: john joined after part of your paste
[09:11:14] <toddparker> saw some typos, but started editing too
[09:11:14] <toddparker> how about "The diversity of implementations of the (push or replace)State API in various browsers can cause odd behavior in some cases (most often when returning to a document onto which state has been pushed or replaced)."
[09:11:14] <toddparker> ah
[09:11:14] <toddparker> how about "Slightly different implementations of the (push or replace)State API in various browsers..."
[09:11:14] <toddparker> re-pasting

[09:11:54] <toddparker> do we even need to mention pushState here at all? we only use replaceState so that single note many be enough
[09:13:00] <johnbender> toddparker: I only added it here because I figured someone would wonder why we're not using pushstate
[09:13:19] <toddparker> johnbender: yeah, agree
[09:13:22] <johnbender> either though the use of => either through the use of
[09:13:26] <toddparker> i think that note makes sense
[09:13:40] <toddparker> but later, we say push or replace state
[09:13:56] <toddparker> I think that second version can just say replaceState
[09:13:57] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: I haven't read the original wording .. but we should explain why we are using replace versus push in there somewhere too
[09:14:27] <kinblas> citing specific platforms if we can ... the more we share with folks, the more they understand our rationale/implementation choices
[09:14:31] <toddparker> ^ End of first paragraph "Note that this feature converts hash-based urls by using history.replaceState (not history.pushState) because this works more reliably across our target platforms."
[09:14:48] <toddparker> i agree about addign specifics
[09:14:57] <toddparker> will help when I link from bug reports
[09:15:03] <toddparker> so what should we say
[09:15:10] <kinblas> ok
[09:15:41] <kinblas> toddparker: I only vaguely remember scott saying there was a bug with pushstate on ios
[09:15:47] <kinblas> I don't remember the details
[09:16:42] <kinblas> but I seem to remember he was collaborating/confirming with someone else? Ben Allman? PPK?
[09:17:15] <johnbender> its a well known bug
[09:17:24] <johnbender> we should be able to google it and reference it if necessary
[09:17:28] <toddparker> ah, you mean the why we used replace rather than push
[09:17:33] <johnbender> but I thought that was a tad too specific for the docs
[09:17:41] <toddparker> maybe we could link out?
[09:17:49] <toddparker> if there's a good article?
[09:17:51] <johnbender> calling out specific vendors is kind of below us isn't it?
[09:18:04] <toddparker> nope
[09:18:06] <toddparker> ;)
[09:18:13] * johnbender stands corrected
[09:18:15] <johnbender> :D
[09:18:21] <toddparker> this isn't to be mean, it's to help people understand the why
[09:18:41] <johnbender> find with me! That's why I left it generic in the first place
[09:18:45] <toddparker> i'm a bit less concerned about explaining why we did replace, not push
[09:18:46] <johnbender> link away!
[09:19:15] <toddparker> i more wonder if we need to explain the type of oddness you may see - browsers, what to expect
[09:19:27] <toddparker> and when to disable this
[09:22:44] <johnbender> toddparker: can we also include the reasoning for enabling it by default
[09:28:59] <johnbender> I'm guessing thats mostly the generic hashs are bad type stuff (js dependency etc)
[09:30:06] <toddparker> yeah
[09:30:15] <toddparker> can one of you help me add a sentence or two
[09:30:26] <toddparker> johnbender: that line front eh issue just now was helpful
[09:30:37] <toddparker> this
[09:30:38] <toddparker> "ome browser implementations (including desktop browsers) implement the `popstate` event differently when linking externally and moving back to a page onto which state has already been pushed/replaced.
[09:32:07] <toddparker> Important: rel="external" and $.mobile.ajaxEnabled=false
[09:32:08] <toddparker> Slightly different implementations of the replaceState API in various browsers can cause odd behavior in specific scenarios.

[09:39:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2588 on jquery-mobile, reported by awoni (1w, 2d ago): Windows Phone 7.5 native select menu problem
[09:40:04] <johnbender> anyone have 7.5 device?
[09:52:10] <kinblas> johnbender: I only have android, bb, and ios
[09:52:58] <kinblas> johnbender: so what do you think about #2644 ?
[09:53:27] <kinblas> johnbender: should we always map site.com/app.html#root to site.com/app.html?
[09:54:17] <johnbender> kinblas: do we ever place the actual string "root"
[09:54:17] <johnbender> ?
[09:54:42] <johnbender> or are you just using the example id
[09:54:43] <kinblas> johnbender: #root is just the example used ... it's the id on the first page in the app document.
[09:54:46] <johnbender> kk
[09:54:49] <johnbender> just wanted to be sure
[09:55:05] <kinblas> johnbender: I gave a workaround in the bug
[09:55:12] <johnbender> yah I'm reading
[09:55:21] <kinblas> but was hesitant because if we fix it, you can't workaround the fix
[09:56:25] <johnbender> ugh this is a tough one
[09:58:51] <johnbender> I guess the hard part in my mind is that the url's are for the most part identical where server resources are concerned
[09:59:00] <johnbender> or they should be
[09:59:23] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah hashes really aren't for server to interpret
[09:59:31] <johnbender> woe betide the developer who does that lol
[10:00:09] <kinblas> johnbender: yet another case where we clean up, but provide a config for leaving it as is?
[10:00:10] <johnbender> but in the client its different
[10:00:29] <johnbender> kinblas: yah maybe you're workaround is an optionn
[10:00:30] <johnbender> ?
[10:00:44] <kinblas> workaround would be default?
[10:00:45] <johnbender> root page as a hash or its original url
[10:00:48] <johnbender> hmm
[10:00:54] <johnbender> I don't like using the hash
[10:01:07] <kinblas> right so default would be "clean"
[10:01:13] <kinblas> disabled would be what we have today
[10:01:13] <johnbender> because its a different place on the page than when the user loaded the page initially
[10:01:23] <johnbender> even if its visually the same
[10:01:29] <johnbender> clean imo
[10:01:37] <kinblas> right, so default is clean
[10:01:39] <kinblas> ??
[10:01:42] <johnbender> yessir
[10:01:46] <kinblas> ok
[10:02:10] <johnbender> kinblas: are there any nav implications or places that we expect the current default behaviour?
[10:02:29] <kinblas> no, we handle finding the first page just fine
[10:02:38] <kinblas> given either the id, or the docUrl or base
[10:02:38] * johnbender is relieved 
[10:02:49] <kinblas> I needed to make sure that worked
[10:02:54] <kinblas> since it was such a special case
[10:02:57] <johnbender> indeed
[10:03:31] <johnbender> kinblas: in your workaround you can consildate the two if's also
[10:03:36] <johnbender> not sure if that was deliberate
[10:03:40] <johnbender> to break up the lines
[10:03:42] <kinblas> heh yeah
[10:03:49] <kinblas> actually that will be simplified
[10:03:52] <kinblas> if I move it into changePage
[10:04:00] <johnbender> brilliant
[10:04:15] <johnbender> kinblas: oh and typeof -> $.type() ?
[10:04:22] <johnbender> might not be necessary
[10:04:29] <johnbender> less overhead the way it is now?
[10:04:44] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, but starting with an 's'
[10:05:20] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I hate making function calls for stuff already built-in to the language
[10:05:22] <kinblas> more overhead
[10:05:27] <johnbender> :D
[10:05:30] <johnbender> I can read your mind!
[10:05:31] <kinblas> but for things like Array where you are doing more than one check
[10:05:32] <johnbender> lol
[10:05:33] <kinblas> it's fine
[10:05:39] <kinblas> johnbender: :-P
[10:07:33] <toddparker> johnbender:  wan a take #2588
[10:08:53] <kinblas> toddparker: we can't take any Windows Phone bugs
[10:08:56] <kinblas> we have no windows phones
[10:09:24] <johnbender> :(
[10:09:47] <toddparker> i know, but this *might* be repro in IE9
[10:09:58] <johnbender> toddparker: ah! good point
[10:10:21] <johnbender> I'm working on the keepNative issue but I'll take that one after, feel free to assign to me
[10:11:53] <toddparker> i did

[10:12:54] <toddparker> yeah
[10:13:00] <johnbender> I'm totally unclear on how arm-twisty MS is being about pushing the new version
[10:13:05] <toddparker> hopefully the IE7 flavor will be gone soon
[10:13:09] <johnbender> yah
[10:13:16] <toddparker> i heard it was going to be pretty twisty

[10:25:47] <toddparker> thanks to nokia

[10:27:40] <toddparker> kinblas and johnbender ^^
[10:30:29] <kinblas> toddparker: hmmm good question, probably if we're not hijacking
[10:38:57] <johnbender> toddparker: possibly but it seems like a low priority
[10:41:08] <johnbender> given the forum post that accompanies the bug
[10:41:19] <toddparker> yeah
[10:41:28] <toddparker> just seems like something we might want to automate

[10:54:58] <johnbender> should I assign the chrome back button + replaceState bug :P
[10:57:06] <toddparker> sure
[11:08:40] <kinblas> toddparker: can we add a flag to our issues tracker
[11:08:46] <kinblas> "Needs unit test case"
[11:09:08] <kinblas> that way we can close bugs that are really fixed, but still track the ones we need to write a test case for?
[11:09:28] * johnbender likes that idea
[11:13:30] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, I want to close 2644, but I feel guilty because I haven't checked in a test case for it yet ... but it is fixed.
[11:20:37] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: gseguin: scottjehl: FYI, I just filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2658

[11:58:29] <toddparker> Hey kinblas just saw #2658
[11:58:45] <toddparker> I agree, but if we made that change, it could cause a lot of ripples
[11:58:55] <toddparker> wish we had just done it from the start
[11:59:06] <toddparker> make everything A
[11:59:12] <toddparker> we over-thought it
[12:02:04] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm wondering if we can fix it, and provide a plugin that can give folks the old behavior
[12:02:09] <kinblas> ??
[12:04:37] <toddparker> not for 1.0 for sure
[12:04:42] <toddparker> sort of a huge change
[12:04:57] <toddparker> if people were relying on defaults and we change 'em all
[12:05:11] <toddparker> there aren't that many in the code
[12:05:30] <toddparker> so we could also have an option to restore the old defaults for a while, then depreciate it
[12:05:32] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, so what does that mean for themeroller, and the fact that we are going to ship the CSS in 3 pieces?
[12:05:43] <toddparker> 3 pieces?
[12:05:48] <kinblas> all, structure, theme
[12:06:09] <toddparker> all is just the current css which we're really going to downplay
[12:06:20] <toddparker> so it will be structure + your theme
[12:06:30] <toddparker> and we'll need to recommend having 3 swatches
[12:06:34] <kinblas> where "your theme" must be "a" and "c" at a minimum?
[12:06:44] <toddparker> if people have less, they will need to set swatches as needed
[12:06:55] <kinblas> toddparker: so then shouldn't TR follow suit?
[12:06:56] <toddparker> i'd say 1-c
[12:06:59] <toddparker> a-c
[12:07:18] <toddparker> TR doesn't let you miss letters
[12:07:45] <toddparker> do you just mean that TR should open with 3 swatches? we can do that
[12:07:46] <toddparker> sure
[12:09:22] <toddparker> hey tbenzige
[12:09:31] <toddparker> kinblas ?
[12:11:32] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah that's what I meant 3 swatches ... it would seem wierd to just start with a and c
[12:12:42] <tbenzige> hey toddparker / kinblas
[12:17:21] <kinblas> toddparker: ^^^
[12:17:24] <kinblas> :-)
[12:26:13] <johnbender> sweet
[12:39:39] <toddparker> hey
[12:40:05] <toddparker> so tbenzige  - we can just start out with 3 gray swatches to start, right
[12:41:08] <tbenzige> sure
[12:41:28] <tbenzige> no problem
[12:45:57] <toddparker> kinblas: i just commented on that ticket

[12:46:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2658 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (1h, 26m ago): All components should default to using the same theme!
[12:48:02] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, I was just adding a toddparker said comment when I saw your update
[12:48:10] <kinblas> ... you beat me to the add comment button :-)
[12:51:10] <toddparker> i'm FAST
[12:51:18] <toddparker> i agree on this tho
[12:51:32] <toddparker> when i was looking at this a few week ago, i had the same thought
[12:51:39] <toddparker> just seemed to late to change
[12:52:03] <toddparker> regrets, i've had a few..like nested lists and theme inheritance...
[12:52:15] <toddparker> (sing in "my Way" tune)
[14:27:22] <johnbender> stepping out for lunch
[14:34:50] <johnbender> kinblas: jorgetaylor: toddparker: I sent my key to dan
[14:35:29] <kinblas> johnbender: right, saw that
[14:37:45] <johnbender> danheberden: did not realize you frequented jqm-dev
[14:37:46] <johnbender> :D
[14:37:50] <johnbender> getting food!
[14:38:10] <danheberden> johnbender not as much as i should, mostly when i get highlights; seems all the fires happen in jq-dev :p
[14:59:46] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: so at what point do we figure out that we need to disable pushstate by default?
[15:00:11] <kinblas> seems like several folks are getting bitten by the back and forth bug
[15:00:15] <kinblas> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jqm-beta3-1-0-rc1-iphone-critical-bug
[15:06:22] <toddparker> kinblas: i guess we can make that call this week
[15:06:39] <toddparker> nice thing is this won't really break anything if we chance defaults
[15:06:50] <toddparker> i gotta jet, be on tonight
[15:07:16] <kinblas> toddparker: turning it off is such a shame since it is really nice .. but I don't think the browsers are ready for prime-time.
[15:09:20] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure what you meant by "chance defaults"
[15:10:39] <johnbender> kinblas: he meant "change defaults"
[15:10:48] <johnbender> or at least I think he did
[15:10:55] <johnbender> danheberden: thanks for helping us out with server access
[15:11:25] <kinblas> johnbender: lol ... thanks I take things way too literally
[15:11:44] * kinblas notes he's a simple man with simple vocabulary and grammar
[15:12:28] <johnbender> kinblas: I just read too fast so my mind filled in for me and I had to go back to see the error :(
[15:12:42] <johnbender> I do that a lot
[15:31:48] <aaronmcadam> woop! my bug got fixed :D cheers toddparker for upgrading the issue :)

[16:16:07] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2558 on jquery-mobile, reported by kurteknikk (1w, 5d ago): Dialog's parent page shouldn't be removed when dialog is open
[16:16:09] <johnbender> I want to close that
[16:16:22] <johnbender> unless others have suggestions
[16:22:30] <johnbender> heading home a bit early, I should be back on in an hour
[16:24:18] <johnbender> danheberden: I'll pester you and eddie tomorrow (either here or via email) about the jqm server deps/setup
