[08:10:09] <scottjehl> hey kinblas
[08:11:25] <scottjehl> quick question about the changepage events. I know we added new events for consistency, which is great, but did we already delete the "changepage" and "beforechangepage" names too? My concern is whether people had adequate warning about that removal. usually we do a deprecation release first... thoughts?
[08:14:46] <kinblas> scottjehl: yes they were deleted ... those events were introduced last release ... and I noticed most folks were still relying show/hide notifications
[08:14:52] <kinblas> so I didn't think it was a big deal
[08:16:39] <kinblas> scottjehl: if you and todd feel strongly, I can put it back, but I removed all other deprecated items that were flagged with comments
[08:20:56] <scottjehl> hmm yeah. I just wanted to ask. So the new names were in B3 then?
[08:21:12] <scottjehl> ..also, awesome that all the old cruft is removed

[08:46:37] <gseguin> hey
[08:59:39] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:00:53] <toddparker> jblas - are you still planning gon adding the page remove event today? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2537#issuecomment-2226695
[09:01:04] <toddparker> kinblas ^^
[09:02:29] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, you made me hesitate, but honestly it makes the notfications/api balanced
[09:03:03] <kinblas> toddparker: ... the whole should we be adding new things at this point talk we had the other day
[09:05:55] <danheberden> toddparker kinblas scottjehl did that demo i posted help about the cache issue?
[09:06:20] <kinblas> danheberden: I guess I'm still confused as to what the issue is.
[09:06:33] <kinblas> is it that when you load a page with a hash appended
[09:06:50] <kinblas> it causes the browser to download the items again?
[09:07:40] <danheberden> kinblas, i'm not sure what's causing it exactly - the issue seems to have more information about the why
[09:08:04] <toddparker> so kinblas, I agree about adding new stuff at this stage, that's why I was asking. If you think it's important, we can do it, but that's pretty much it.
[09:08:18] <kinblas> toddparker: I think it's important
[09:08:42] <danheberden> but whatever it is is preventing the caching from actually working
[09:08:47] <kinblas> toddparker: folks take advantage of the notifications to do custom things ...without the pageremove they have no clue when to clean things up
[09:08:52] <danheberden> like, it's not that i can go to the page and it loads, but switching pages fails - it all fails
[09:09:02] <danheberden> i wish i had an android phone to test against
[09:09:25] <kinblas> danheberden: I was having a tough time just getting things to cache yesterday on my ipad
[09:09:36] <kinblas> when in airplane mode, I would just enter the same URL
[09:09:43] <kinblas> and it would balk that there was no network
[09:09:49] <kinblas> instead of loading the page
[09:10:20] <kinblas> danheberden: I'll give it more of a look today, I need to tie up a checkin I have for the next 15 minutes
[09:10:24] <danheberden> kinblas exactly
[09:10:30] <danheberden> that's the same trouble i'm having
[09:10:46] <kinblas> danheberden: honestly it's always seemed wonky on iOS for me
[09:10:57] <kinblas> danheberden: it should be a no brainer
[09:11:00] <kinblas> but it isn't
[09:11:05] <kinblas> it's just a list of things to preload
[09:11:08] <kinblas> to prime the cache
[09:11:15] <danheberden> i tried a demo of a cache manifest on the phone just to make sure it wasn't my phone/ipad
[09:11:15] <kinblas> but it doesn't cache!
[09:11:19] <danheberden> and it works great
[09:11:34] <kinblas> which phone?
[09:11:39] <danheberden> iphone4 and ipad1
[09:11:45] <kinblas> so it works on both?
[09:11:46] <danheberden> 4.3.2 i think
[09:11:50] <danheberden> caching itself works
[09:11:54] <danheberden> caching via latest jqm? no
[09:12:16] * kinblas is confused now
[09:12:25] <danheberden> this guy has a demo of an older jqm with caching: http://www.roccles.com/?p=207
[09:12:27] <danheberden> and it works great
[09:13:00] <danheberden> the new site/schedule that doug built with jqm just doesn't cache on ios :/
[09:13:37] <kinblas> danheberden: is he switching while the app is still up?
[09:13:45] <kinblas> switching to airplane mode that is
[09:14:00] <kinblas> danheberden: what I was trying to do was load the app from scratch (new browser page)
[09:14:04] <kinblas> while in airplane mode
[09:14:56] <danheberden> i tried a few different things - i tried loading the page, waiting a bit, then switching to settings, turning on airplane mode and going back to safari. Instant 'not online' message and switching pages errors
[09:15:03] <danheberden> i also tried saving to the desktop
[09:15:12] <danheberden> and also tried going to one of the pages via a new window
[09:15:22] <danheberden> but then i found this, so it seemed that was the problem? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2546
[09:15:41] <danheberden> I added some dianostic stuff into it to get events about what's going on
[09:17:57] <kinblas> danheberden: would it be possible to add this include to your app document?
[09:17:57] <kinblas> http://shinarp.com/utils/watch-jqm-nav.js
[09:18:10] <kinblas> that prints out the page nave events so we can see what is going on.
[09:18:11] <danheberden> def - gimme a sec to pop it in
[09:18:15] <kinblas> prints to the console
[09:19:45] <kinblas> danheberden: also, I wasn't sure what page was a sampleI could use for navigation (which is why I started to build my own) the main page under /m/ doesn't have any links ... or at least it didn't when I pulled it down.
[09:21:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #82: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/82/
[09:21:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> maggie: clarified initSelector description
[09:22:19] <danheberden> kinblas i don't understand - http://events.jquery.org/beta/htdocs/m/ doesn't work for you?
[09:22:35] <danheberden> http://events.jquery.org/beta/htdocs/m/index.php, http://events.jquery.org/beta/htdocs/m/speakers.php, etc
[09:23:31] <danheberden> kinblas http://events.jquery.org/beta/htdocs/m/cache.manifest as well
[09:23:48] <kinblas> danheberden: ignore me ... I see the links are in the toolbar ... I was expecting typical listview links
[09:24:13] <danheberden> yeah, it's super basic - just incase the wifi is shitty, though, we wanted the schedule to cache
[09:27:50] <danheberden> kinblas added that script
[09:28:14] <kinblas> danheberden: so that script logs all of the attempts to navigate to another page
[09:28:45] <kinblas> when things fail, what I'm curious about is if the the paths to the file in question is correct or not?
[09:29:01] <kinblas> The absURL is what actually gets loaded via XHR
[09:29:32] <kinblas> danheberden: do I need to add my shinarp script under NETWORK in my local cache.manifest?
[09:40:29] <gseguin> toddparker: looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2527
[09:40:38] <kinblas> danheberden: why aren't you caching the JS files too?
[09:40:56] * gseguin wonders where socialhapy bot went
[09:41:42] <gseguin> toddparker: one way to work around would be to use ui-body-%%swatch%% instead of ui-btn-up-%%swatch%%
[09:42:43] <gseguin> toddparker: I have it implemented here: http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/
[09:44:12] <scottjehl> kinblas nickel agree? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2554
[09:47:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: yup
[10:16:54] <kinblas> danheberden: it's the XHR that's failing ... I see the URL used in both online/offline are identical
[10:21:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #83: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/83/
[10:21:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Fixes #2529 - Transition to the same page
[10:24:50] <danheberden> kinblas the js is cached via network, since it's cdn
[10:25:31] <kinblas> danheberden: hmm, i wasn't able to get things to load properly when offline unless it was in the cache
[10:25:53] * kinblas grumbles about how wonky this app cache stuff is on os
[10:26:22] <kinblas> danheberden: I also figured out that you have to close all windows in the browser that reference the app before clearing the cache
[10:26:22] <danheberden> i may not be following the problem then, properly?
[10:27:03] <kinblas> danheberden: the problem we're tryiing to solve is the page failed error you see when offline right?
[10:27:16] <danheberden> well, that and it not working at all
[10:27:26] <danheberden> like, past the error, it just doesn't cache anything
[10:27:38] <kinblas> danheberden: I was also able to recreate that error by closing the browser window that had the initial load, and then loading it again in a new window
[10:27:40] <danheberden> as if you were offline and tehre was no cache manifest
[10:27:45] <kinblas> even when online!
[10:27:50] <danheberden> that's weird
[10:28:00] <kinblas> yeah its wonky and inconsistent
[10:28:00] <danheberden> so is it a jqm issue?
[10:28:17] <kinblas> danheberden: at this point I'm tempted to write a barebones sample
[10:28:22] <kinblas> no jqm involved
[10:28:29] <kinblas> just to see if there's a problem
[10:28:32] <danheberden> ah
[10:28:36] <kinblas> I saw someone else complaining that their XHR fails
[10:28:39] <kinblas> when using a manifest
[10:28:44] <kinblas> totally unrelated to jqm
[10:29:25] <kinblas> danheberden: so is this a showstopper for the conference?
[10:29:33] <kinblas> I'm trying to balance priorities for rc1
[10:29:37] <danheberden> yeah, we're totally gonna cancel it if we can't get this to work
[10:29:41] <kinblas> ugh
[10:29:42] <danheberden> :D
[10:29:43] <kinblas> that sucks
[10:29:49] <kinblas> cancel what? caching?
[10:29:51] <danheberden> nah, it'd just be nice
[10:29:53] <kinblas> or using jqm
[10:29:55] <danheberden> no, the conference
[10:29:59] <kinblas> lol
[10:30:01] <danheberden> just... tell everyone to go home
[10:30:05] <kinblas> lol
[10:30:11] <danheberden> it'd be really nice to ahve it cache
[10:30:18] <kinblas> I just meant is it blocking you from getting the site live
[10:30:20] <danheberden> and if we can't, we'll just make it one big-ass page
[10:30:25] <kinblas> ugh
[10:30:26] <danheberden> yeah, it's a blocker
[10:30:34] <danheberden> but, we're last minute, so oh wells
[10:30:39] <danheberden> our own fault
[10:31:01] <kinblas> danheberden: in terms of blockage, things work fine without the manifest right?
[10:31:05] <kinblas> it just won't work offline
[10:31:23] <danheberden> ya
[10:54:34] <Wilto> DAN
[10:54:41] <Wilto> Congrats!
[11:00:44] <scottjehl> so any hints at why the ajax is failing offline?

[13:28:28] <kinblas> lol
[13:33:36] <toddparker> key kinblas: thoughts? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2559
[13:34:47] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure what we're going to do about that ... we need to figure out how to cancel the native tap hold from our fake one.
[13:35:50] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm not sure we can tell if the browser is going to fire one of its built-in behaviors
[13:36:21] <kinblas> toddparker: those custom events need some lovin'
[13:36:37] <kinblas> they have other problems, like for example I don't think the events they generate bubble-up
[13:36:47] <kinblas> etc
[13:38:10] <kinblas> toddparker: while you're here, I'm thinking of punting on 1373 for RC1
[13:38:22] <kinblas> that's going to take some testing across *ALL* platforms
[13:38:36] <kinblas> to see what the id support for touch is
[13:38:57] <kinblas> toddparker: something I don't think I have time for between now and noon tomorrow.
[13:46:52] <toddparker> kinblas: sure, no problem
[13:47:34] <scottjehl> I'm not sure if e should support taphold. seems pretty intrusive.
[13:47:41] <scottjehl> but that's for later
[13:50:05] <toddparker> I moved #1373 to RC2
[13:50:22] <toddparker> think i agree with scottjehl on the taphold
[13:50:30] <toddparker> it's flaky at best in our experience on the globe
[13:51:13] <toddparker> only 4 things left not he RC1 issues list: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=8&sort=updated&direction=asc&state=open

[13:51:28] <toddparker> I think he's traveling today
[13:51:50] <toddparker> kinblas: you want to look at any of those if you have time?
[13:53:19] <kinblas> toddparker: Yes, I can look at those after I tie up the documentation updates I've been meaning to do for the last few months?
[13:53:24] <kinblas> are any of those blockers?
[13:53:38] <kinblas> And where does that offline-cache problem fall in priority? RC2?
[13:54:09] <toddparker> the one for dan?
[13:55:13] <toddparker> looking at those
[13:55:18] <toddparker> none are blockers
[14:01:59] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah the one dan is seeing
[14:03:18] <scottjehl> sounds like they'll make it single page if we can't fix it. nooooooo!! :)
[14:07:18] <kinblas> scottjehl: it will be faster that way? ;-P
[14:07:56] <kinblas> documenting is so tedious < sigh >
