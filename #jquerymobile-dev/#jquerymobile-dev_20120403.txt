[10:56:10] <kinblas> toddparker: Wilto: scottjehl: didn't we used to figure out what our initial orientation was at startup by looking at the width to height ratio? Just curious why we stopped that.

[11:05:04] <scottjehl> kinblas hey
[11:05:28] <kinblas> scottjehl: hey, I've been a little behind in making some needed jqm fixes
[11:05:59] <kinblas> in particular, the orientation bug on iPhone/iPod ( iOS 4.2 and up)
[11:06:18] <scottjehl> I think we should try that test again - inner[width|height] should work for that
[11:06:24] <kinblas> basically the iphone/ipod in 4.2 and later *ALWAYS* applies landscape media query
[11:06:38] <kinblas> scottjehl: we used to do that right?
[11:06:49] <scottjehl> you just need to do something like window.innerWidth || $(window).width()
[11:07:13] <scottjehl> well, I think we did maybe
[11:07:14] <kinblas> scottjehl: I guess what I'm wondering is if I should just remove the use of media queries to figure that out or not
[11:07:18] <scottjehl> blame would tell us
[11:07:36] <kinblas> I recall us figuring out this stuff based on width/height in the past in media.js
[11:07:42] <kinblas> but that code is gone now
[11:07:49] <kinblas> was curious if there was a reason we stopped
[11:07:55] <scottjehl> if we can do it more simply and broadly, and without mq's, give it a shot
[11:08:15] <scottjehl> oh well, in the early betas we simulated mqs with classes
[11:08:16] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok ... so what is it looking like for 1.1 in terms of time
[11:08:17] <scottjehl> that's gone now
[11:08:25] <kinblas> we (me) really needs to fix it
[11:08:28] <scottjehl> different
[11:08:40] <kinblas> what's gone?
[11:08:58] <Wilto> Whatup.
[11:08:59] <scottjehl> we decided to just use real media queries instead
[11:09:07] <scottjehl> that was ages ago
[11:09:21] <scottjehl> if you need IE desktop support for them, there's a polyfill :)
[11:09:24] <kinblas> yeah... like I said I was wondering if there was a technical reason why
[11:09:26] <scottjehl> ...was our message
[11:10:01] <scottjehl> well that's unrelated to this though. As for whether we used innerWidth etc in the orientation check ever, I'm not sure
[11:11:38] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok so then I'll try doing something like isLandscape = ( window.innerWidth || $( window ).width() ) < (window.innerHeight || $( window ).height() );
[11:11:43] <kinblas> and remove the mq if I can
[11:11:58] <scottjehl> I think that'd be worth testing broadly, yes
[11:12:05] <kinblas> okie dokie
[11:12:14] <Wilto> what is media queries are those new
[11:12:57] <scottjehl> like, maybe in a jsbin with a logger in the page on load and orientationchange / resize
[11:13:35] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah I always create basic tests for this kind of stuff
[11:13:38] <Wilto> I thought we had one of those kicking around?
[11:13:57] <Wilto> tests/functional/orientation.html
[11:14:01] <kinblas> Wilto: the project has tests/functional/orientation.html
[11:14:11] <kinblas> but it's showing the bug because of the media query
[11:14:22] <Wilto> Ah.
[11:14:27] * kinblas checks if apple even looked at the bug
[11:14:29] <scottjehl> what's the failing test all about?
[11:14:32] <scottjehl>   "clear text" button for search inputs should use configured text"
[11:14:35] <scottjehl> anyone on that?
[11:14:56] <Wilto> All yours. I’m on client stuff/Keynote.
[11:15:01] <scottjehl> k I gotta run. Looking forward to seeing what you find, Kin
[11:15:31] <kinblas> scottjehl: ok thanks

[13:03:26] <toddparker> johnbender: was going to look at this - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3768
[13:03:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3768 on jquery-mobile (haroldneal-cap; 3w, 5d ago): Double transitions with jqm 1.1-rc1 and phonegap 1.4.1 + fixed toolbars
[13:03:38] <toddparker> that zip isn't up on dropbox anymore - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4837669/JQMTest.zip
[13:03:42] <toddparker> i get a 404
[13:07:47] <johnbender> toddparker: crap
[13:07:52] <johnbender> one sec
[13:11:47] <johnbender> toddparker: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4837669/JQMTest.zip
[13:11:51] <johnbender> should be working now
[13:12:00] <toddparker> thanks
[13:13:58] <toddparker> bah. my Xcode is completely hosed
[13:14:30] <toddparker> so johnbender - this issue is looking like a rendering issue more than anything?
[13:14:44] <johnbender> toddparker: it _seems_ that way
[13:14:49] <toddparker> seems like jQM and PG aren't happy together…dunno if it's us or them
[13:15:04] <johnbender> I don't think it's either
[13:15:13] <johnbender> I think it's the browser
[13:15:30] <johnbender> although I didn't try it in the vanilla browser
[13:15:33] <johnbender> or did I
[13:15:39] <johnbender> ... checking the issue
[13:16:39] <johnbender> toddparker: it might be work trying out in the emulator browser too
[13:17:12] <johnbender> but it could be that the webview isn't accelerated in the same way
[13:17:37] <toddparker> right
[13:17:41] <toddparker> that's my thinking
[13:18:02] <toddparker> that the differences between safari vs. embedded
[13:18:04] <johnbender> toddparker: let me turn it into a jsbin real quick and then I'll try it out
[13:18:09] <toddparker> k
[13:18:24] <johnbender> toddparker: last I heard the only difference was nitro
[13:18:26] <johnbender> but who know
[13:18:31] <johnbender> *knows
[13:18:37] * johnbender goes to make a jsbin
[13:18:40] <toddparker> i know that in 5.1, apple took away a lot of the cache/storage stuff in embedded
[13:19:04] <toddparker> notro probably makes a big diff, but not with rendering
[13:21:58] <toddparker> re-downloading a fresh copy of scode
[13:22:01] <toddparker> xcode
[13:22:15] <toddparker> my simulator works tho
[13:22:42] <johnbender> toddparker: ah nevermind there's a jsbin posted in the issue at the top
[13:23:36] <toddparker> ha!
[13:24:42] <johnbender> toddparker: yah it shows the same issue in the emulator browser
[13:24:43] <johnbender> jesus
[13:24:47] <johnbender> why didn't I check that first
[13:24:51] <johnbender> first rule of debugging
[13:24:56] <johnbender> verify the issue first
[13:25:04] <johnbender> then find the easiest environment in which to reproduce
[13:25:09] <johnbender> so I guess it's the second rule of debugging
[13:25:17] <johnbender> but I just made those up right now :P
[13:25:29] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/eyufam/54
[13:25:31] <johnbender> go there
[13:25:36] <johnbender> scroll down
[13:25:51] <johnbender> and hit one of the buttons that changes the link in header
[13:25:59] <johnbender> you'll see the flash
[13:26:04] <toddparker> so i have that page open in my emulator
[13:26:56] <toddparker> and i see a flash sometimes
[13:27:01] <toddparker> but i see the chrome flash
[13:27:10] <toddparker> i don't see double transitions tho
[13:27:11] <johnbender> "chrome"
[13:27:16] <johnbender> the header?
[13:27:23] <toddparker> url bar
[13:27:25] <johnbender> it's not a double transition like 1  .... then 2
[13:27:26] <toddparker> = chrome
[13:27:37] <johnbender> right I have no idea why that would flash
[13:27:47] <johnbender> that's why I asked, that's totally crazytown
[13:27:49] <toddparker> you see that too, right?
[13:27:54] <johnbender> no
[13:27:56] <johnbender> lol
[13:27:59] <toddparker> hrm
[13:29:25] <toddparker> on my 4S, if I save this jsbin to my home screen, i see the URL cash in and out
[13:29:29] <toddparker> flash
[13:29:33] <johnbender> ah
[13:29:38] <toddparker> this seems like a rendering bug
[13:29:39] <johnbender> I'm looking at an ipad per the issue
[13:29:49] <johnbender> but if it's in both places then yah
[13:30:00] <toddparker> i'm sure doing a 3D transform + fixed toolbars = too much
[13:30:04] <johnbender> toddparker: it might be but at the very least it's the animations which are outside my wheelhouse
[13:30:11] <johnbender> toddparker: that's what I was thinking
[13:30:31] <johnbender> toddparker: especially given that it isn't an issue until you scroll down
[13:31:04] <johnbender> toddparker: does the number of z indicies affect rendering performance?
[13:31:16] <johnbender> I wonder if you just add random z-index elements if you can repro
[13:31:21] * johnbender is just curious
[13:34:09] <toddparker> not sure
[13:34:16] <toddparker> i've found the 3D stuff is very taxing
[13:34:32] <johnbender> not surprisingly
[13:34:34] <toddparker> the fact that the app itself is blinking tells me that iOS is losing it
[13:35:30] <toddparker> do you know if saving a web page to your home screen is equivalent to an app w/ web view?
[13:36:57] <toddparker> seems like a web view in both cases = slower
[13:36:58] <toddparker> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8853260/ios-webapp-performance-safari-vs-home-screen-start
[13:37:47] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure, but it the chrome thing is crazytown
[13:38:09] <johnbender> toddparker: that might be an artifact of the scrolling change that scott made recently too
[13:39:52] <johnbender> toddparker: I have to get started on this rails app
[13:43:30] <toddparker> which rails app?
[13:43:58] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm doing a reference app 1) for a blog article for work 2) for part of my RailsConf presentation

[13:50:50] <toddparker> ah, gotcha
[13:50:55] <toddparker> i commented ont hat issue
[13:51:03] <toddparker> not sure what we can do there
[13:51:17] <toddparker> it's clear that some of these new css things are a little flaky
[13:52:47] <johnbender> toddparker: yah that's like a three day expedition into the css
[14:00:49] <aaronmcadam> anyone on?
[14:07:52] <toddparker> kinda :)
[14:19:18] <aaronmcadam> hehe hey todd
[14:19:34] <aaronmcadam> had issues before on android making it show the css icons
[14:19:49] <aaronmcadam> just trying to have another look with the latest snapshot
[14:20:23] <aaronmcadam> now my wifi is playing up ha
[14:21:00] <aaronmcadam> been workin on this project for nearly a year, now it's finally gone live
[14:33:08] <aaronmcadam> hmm still got the issue of the css icons not showing up
[14:51:19] <aaronmcadam> dammit it doesn't seem to be loading the new icons
[14:55:12] <toddparker> huh
[14:55:21] <toddparker> are these our standard icons or a custom set?
[14:55:29] <toddparker> are you live/
[15:00:40] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:00:44] <aaronmcadam> standard
[15:00:50] <aaronmcadam> the site's live yeah
[15:01:13] <aaronmcadam> I'm wondering if it somehow it's not loading the latest copy of the images
[15:01:19] <aaronmcadam> referring to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2136
[15:01:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2136 on jquery-mobile (rubenpal; 8m, 1w ago): data icons positioning off on Android
[15:06:24] <aaronmcadam> sorry toddparker didn't realise you'd responded
[15:36:44] <toddparker> could be
[15:36:49] <toddparker> maybe you can clear cache
[15:37:03] <toddparker> or intentionally edit the sprite
[15:37:14] <toddparker> or add a query param at the end of the img src to force it to re-load
[15:41:57] <aaronmcadam> hmm but that comes from the css file
[15:42:12] <aaronmcadam> I've just removed the images folder, gonna try to redeploy
[15:42:22] <aaronmcadam> touching it didn't make a difference to the file
[16:07:43] <aaronmcadam> hmm still not working
