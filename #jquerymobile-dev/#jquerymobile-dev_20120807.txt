[00:06:04] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[00:06:05] <bot-t> (3 hours 11 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I'm curious if the test suite runs for you locally now
[00:06:05] <bot-t> (3 hours 11 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I'll ping you tomorrow and maybe you can check it quickly
[00:26:25] <uGoMobi> good morning
[00:32:32] <_|Nix|_> Morns!
[00:34:15] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Even after npm install npm -g (to get to version 1.1.46 of npm), a git clean -x -d -f -f, and a make, I still get the same result :(
[00:34:16] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[00:39:12] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender My phantomjs is the latest - 1.6.0 ...
[00:39:13] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[00:40:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: have to go to sleep but that's a bummer
[00:40:34] <johnbender> works perfect here and on the ci :(
[00:40:38] <johnbender> with latest master?
[00:41:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, unfortunately. Good night!
[00:42:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: One more thing: The ROOT_DOMAIN: It's http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile, if that's where I normally look at the docs, right?

[03:43:35] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (2m, 6h ago): Fixes #3983 - Changed display inline-block rule to only be applied to buttons that are direct children of the header/footer.
[07:35:48] <toddparker> good morning
[07:38:13] <toddparker> uGoMobi: re: that bottom glow on the sliders and clear buttons in headers
[07:38:29] <toddparker> i'm wondering if that bottom hit is even a good idea anymore in general
[07:43:51] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: just FYI I'm updating codiqa to 1.1.1, just in case there are any odd issues like last time. I've tested so far and it's fun
[07:43:52] <maxlynch> fine*
[07:47:27] <toddparker> oh good maxlynch
[09:17:14] <toddparker> _|Nix|_:  you around?
[09:18:34] <uGoMobi> toddparker: +1 for removing that bottom glow
[09:19:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: when you run the test suite are you seeing the timeout or errors?
[09:19:51] <bot-t> (8 hours 45 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Even after npm install npm -g (to get to version 1.1.46 of npm), a git clean -x -d -f -f, and a make, I still get the same result :(

[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: seems like you found two issues with using jQuery 1.8, the one with $.attrFn and the selector issue. were there others?
[09:22:20] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: that and we had some tests that relied on the "events" data
[09:22:27] <johnbender> but I pulled those out
[09:22:33] <johnbender> since we're using _on
[09:22:37] <DaveMethvin> just unit tests?
[09:22:41] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yah
[09:22:42] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:22:55] <DaveMethvin> also you can get to them via jQuery._data("events") if you still need it
[09:23:09] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we don't
[09:23:17] <DaveMethvin> good :)
[09:23:23] <johnbender> since switching to the new _on we'd be testing the widget, which is not our job
[09:23:30] <johnbender> err testing the widget factory
[09:23:34] <DaveMethvin> ok just trying to figure out if we could get 1.8 compatible with 1.1.1
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> when does 1.1.2 come out?
[09:23:44] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'd imagine we can
[09:23:50] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[09:23:56] <DaveMethvin> pass-buck
[09:23:58] <johnbender> lol
[09:24:10] <johnbender> we'll have to add this security fix I'm working on for sure
[09:24:18] <johnbender> but other than that I'm not sure what Todd's plans are
[09:24:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can add $.attrFn={} and just ignore what goes in it for now
[09:24:47] <DaveMethvin> and the selector stuff gibson042 is looking at
[09:24:54] <DaveMethvin> oh was that the XSS problem?
[09:25:01] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: were it me, I would release 1.1.2 well after 1.2 so we can get some testing
[09:25:05] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yah
[09:25:13] <johnbender> browser bug turned jqm bug
[09:25:19] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:25:35] <johnbender> add one more onto the "It's all webkit" anti-myth stack
[09:26:00] <DaveMethvin> some webkits are more webkitty than others
[09:26:44] <DaveMethvin> ok well then i'll see if we can get 1.1.1 running so there isn't a deluge of complainers
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> the core team has a saying, "Core ain't done till Mobile won't run"
[09:27:11] <DaveMethvin> so we succeeded!
[09:28:20] <johnbender> lol
[09:28:53] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it should be a matter of cherry picking those 2 or 3 patches over
[09:29:05] <johnbender> or merging the pr from gnarf and then cherry picking
[09:29:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: if you want me to do it I certainly cna
[09:29:14] <johnbender> *can
[09:56:16] <toddparker> 1.1.2 can drop as soon as we want
[09:56:32] <toddparker> if there are just a few fixes that we want to get out, let's land 'em and do it
[09:56:56] <toddparker> one of the corrode fixes didn't make it into 1.1.1 so i'd like to do that sooner than later
[09:57:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to 1.1-stable: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/3bc0656e4994...882c04592ed6

[09:58:03] <toddparker> "Core ain't done till Mobile won't run" <-- nice
[09:58:21] <toddparker> DAMMIT DAVE
[09:58:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:58:55] <toddparker> so what would you fella like to do on 1.1.2 timing
[09:59:19] <DaveMethvin> if it's going to be more than a week, i'd like to get 1.1.1 working with 1.8
[09:59:24] <DaveMethvin> and i think we can do that
[09:59:30] <toddparker> it'll be more than a week
[09:59:39] <DaveMethvin> ok, np
[09:59:42] <toddparker> cool
[09:59:52] <toddparker> be we can start gearing up for it
[09:59:56] <DaveMethvin> all we need to do is add back an empty $.attrFn and fix the selector issue
[09:59:59] <toddparker> 1.1.1 final just landed recently
[10:00:21] <toddparker> but these little maintenance releases can just go to rc then out
[10:00:42] <toddparker> good to hear
[10:01:03] <DaveMethvin> i don't like lots of releases, it takes me a day or two just to write up the release notes
[10:01:04] <toddparker> looks like we shoulda been testing 1.8 sooner. sorry.
[10:01:18] <DaveMethvin> well i tested it a while back but forgot to retest after a few thigns changed
[10:01:29] <DaveMethvin> i think the last time was just before the conf
[10:01:36] <toddparker> yeah, lots of coordination - blog, website, theme roller, download builder, stc.
[10:01:40] <DaveMethvin> and then timmy rewrote sizzle twice :D
[10:01:49] <toddparker> DAMMIT TIMMY
[10:02:10] <DaveMethvin> ok, back to my blog post
[10:02:22] <toddparker> johnbender: how is 1.2.0alpha on 1.8?
[10:04:35] <toddparker> i need to hop into a loooong meeting
[10:04:38] <toddparker> be back later
[10:23:31] <johnbender> toddparker: master passes
[10:30:39] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'm also still working on splitting up manipulations (I haven't spent much time on it recently)
[10:31:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems like youve been busy johnbender :P
[10:31:27] <DaveMethvin> fyi i think timmywil just got that selector bug fixed that you reported
[10:31:54] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: The biggest, and most interesting, issue that I've encountered so far is that there is code executed once for a set or a single element
[10:32:07] <johnbender> or that _can be_ executed once for a set or a single item
[10:32:38] <johnbender> the example I have right now is in checking the $.fn.html value param to see if innerHtml can be used
[10:32:52] <johnbender> in the name of performance some accounting will have to be made for that
[10:33:01] <johnbender> and I haven't figured out what that looks like just yet
[10:33:35] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it could be that the dom alterting methods are all just collection methods without the dependency on the jquery object and with less user friendliness code
[10:34:33] <johnbender> so the could be used like $.dom.html(document.querySelectorAll("div"), "<span>foo</span>");
[10:34:38] * johnbender in rambling
[10:34:39] <johnbender> anyway
[10:34:44] <johnbender> interesting things
[10:34:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll be interested to see how that turns out
[10:34:57] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling it will add size to do that refactor
[10:35:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it does but not a massive amount
[10:35:21] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: there's no need to duplicate methods
[10:35:41] <johnbender> especially not dom manip
[10:35:41] <DaveMethvin> right you get the payback b/c the "wrapper" isn't there i guess
[10:35:46] <johnbender> yes!
[10:36:02] <johnbender> I should be done with manipulations in another couple hours of work
[10:36:07] <johnbender> test are of course all passing
[10:58:58] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I am around.
[10:59:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Same warning as before: "PhantomJS timed out, possibly due to a missing QUnit start() call. Use --force to continue."
[11:01:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Since you landed the slider ._on() stuff in master, can we do likewise for the rest of widget-on-refactor?
[11:19:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I put that in as a concession to testing against jquery git :(
[11:19:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there were some issues with the tests, I could go back and pull it out for now but I'd like to wait on that
[11:20:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that is, I figured out what the issues were after the fact but I guess I'd like to wait
[11:20:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fully realizing that this appears to be a double standard
[11:20:36] <johnbender> but I feel like I had a good reason (we broke with 1.8 core)
[11:20:55] <johnbender> so I wanted to get the tests going so we can avoid that before 1.2 is released
[11:21:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/
[11:21:16] <johnbender> did that yesterday
[11:21:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ok, if it's the timeout we can try to address that
[11:22:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm going to see if I can introduce a sane time to wait and then I might get you to test it

[12:33:31] <jzaefferer> johnbender: when it comes to "hey, mobile should do something UI is doing already!", your course of action should be "how did you solve it?" - in this case, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.js
[12:33:41] <jzaefferer> johnbender: where "this case": testing against jquery-git
[12:59:33] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks, I didn't write the tag inserter
[12:59:58] <johnbender> jzaefferer: also, and I do look to how UI does things in many cases
[13:00:20] <johnbender> s/also, and/and/
[13:00:22] <jzaefferer> johnbender: :-)
[13:00:40] <jzaefferer> I don't know what "tag inserter" is
[13:00:53] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that also assumes that we know upfront that you are already doing that thing
[13:01:21] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I dont have the UI code base memorized nor do I intend to undertake that
[13:01:52] <jzaefferer> johnbender: that's what I said: "hey, mobile should do something UI is doing already!" - not "hey, mobile should do this new thing!"
[13:02:12] <johnbender> jzaefferer: right but your example bears out that assumption
[13:02:23] <jzaefferer> johnbender: okay, sorry about that
