[05:07:06] <ysor> is there any download of jqueryui minified, with all modules separated in files? I dont want to load all modules on each page, but i also dont want to build 30 different setup combinations of jqueryui. i want to place all the files separated and use asset manager serverside (Zend Framework 2 module) to glue the required parts in to a single file
[05:07:30] <ysor> and cache
[05:44:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: did some more poking around
[05:45:21] <mikesherov> looks like the only effects that currently allow their containers to grow and shrink are "blind" and "fold"
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> this is in master
[05:48:42] <mikesherov> and if we wanted to keep this behavior, "clip" isn't appropriate to animate since it keeps the original dimensions...
[05:49:01] <mikesherov> we'd need to animate width and height on the placeholder to achieve the same effect.
[05:49:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[06:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: So do we need a wrapper for those to mimic clip?
[06:40:10] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so the master implementation is for them to shrink
[06:40:19] <mikesherov> which you said you wanted to preserve
[07:00:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're not shrinking to the top left, then don't you need to mimic clip somehow?
[07:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, and this is why we don't announce release dates: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/api-redesigns-the-past-present-and-future/comment-page-1/#comment-3275
[07:40:31] <jzaefferer> :p
[07:42:28] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[07:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Don't say it.
[07:42:41] <_zoggy_> seems to be broken for me in firefox on windows
[07:42:48] <_zoggy_> k
[07:43:37] <_zoggy_> by default it shows the underline select :x (and then theres no space after it)
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[07:44:06] <_zoggy_> ok better.. still missing space though once you show the original combo
[07:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what space is supposed to be there.
[07:44:58] <_zoggy_> http://zoggy.net/jui-3.png
[07:45:17] <_zoggy_> see how they buddy up next to each other
[07:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> Send a pull request?
[07:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> I have a really hard time caring about this demo.
[07:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> I wish jzaefferer never wrote it.
[07:57:53] <_zoggy_> hehe
[07:58:14] <_zoggy_> sure i can, but it will have to be in a few. about to run out to an appointment
[07:59:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: You don't want me to exist? :-(
[07:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You can exist, just not the things you create :-P
[08:00:11] <jzaefferer> Bazinga
[08:09:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: since gnarf isn't around: I just rebased his branch locally, the combobox is now working fine
[08:09:08] <jzaefferer> Can I merge it?
[08:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, can you just double check that no .data() uses are left?
[08:11:28] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:14:34] <jzaefferer> for example, in unit tests like this one? https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/blob/ticket-9030/tests/unit/autocomplete/autocomplete_core.js#L102
[08:14:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that should also be using instance, right?
[08:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe he didn't look at tests.
[08:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> Since he has a commit for demos and a commit for widgets.
[08:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe just tack on a new commit for tests.
[08:16:57] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub and I disagree on what "way too long" means: http://cl.ly/image/3k0N1T0J3o21
[08:24:25] <jzaefferer> I've seen that a few times. It always shows up instantly
[08:25:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I don't understand how this test is passing: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/blob/ticket-9030/tests/unit/widget/widget_core.js#L1429
[08:25:27] <jzaefferer> same in master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/widget/widget_core.js#L1413
[08:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[08:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> typeof null?
[08:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> .data() should be returning undefined though.
[08:27:05] <jzaefferer> its the widget instance
[08:27:16] <jzaefferer> What does this call actually do? $.widget.bridge( "testWidget", TestWidget );
[08:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> This is interesting: https://github.com/styleguide/templates/2.0
[08:27:24] <jzaefferer> Creating the widget without a namespace?
[08:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh... this is just going through the bridge.
[08:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> So, $.widget.bridge( name, obj )
[08:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> If `obj.prototype.widgetFullName` doesn't exist, then it uses `name` for the data key.
[08:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> I did that to reduce the boilerplate required for widgets created directly through the bridge.
[08:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> And $.widget() generates the obj.prototype.widgetFullName property.
[08:29:58] <jzaefferer> So the test is correct and I shouldn't change it to use instance?
[08:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> We should keep that assertion and add another one for the instance method.
[08:32:10] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:33:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: this is an odd one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L723
[08:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, so this is interesting.
[08:34:20] <jzaefferer> Looks like that should also use the instance method, since it'll also take care of the inheritance issue this is like dealing with
[08:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> Inside a widget, you're not allowed to refer to yourself by name.
[08:34:29] <jzaefferer> aka lack of polymorphism in the widget factory
[08:34:48] <gnarf> i wanted to still test .data() in the places it made sense
[08:34:50] <jzaefferer> the instance method mike actually be another step in getting us closer to polymorphism
[08:34:57] <scott_gonzalez> You can't use the instance method.
[08:34:58] <jzaefferer> oh hey gnarf
[08:35:02] <gnarf> also, i'm going to be very AFK today / tomorrow
[08:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Because you don't know your own name.
[08:35:21] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[08:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing will ever get us to polymorphism except http://temp.nemikor.com/worlds-collide/
[08:35:34] <jzaefferer> so yeah, not helping
[08:35:41] <jzaefferer> worlds collide?
[08:35:51] <jzaefferer> ah, right :p
[08:37:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how about this one? Using $.data: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L570
[08:37:44] <jzaefferer> Corey changed the .data call above that
[08:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> That should use instance.
[08:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> Though it will suffer from the dialog polymorphism problem.
[08:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like the problem can't be solved properly right now.
[08:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> Because anything we do will fail if there's a mixture of child and parent instances.
[08:39:44] <jzaefferer> There are no tests for that option
[08:39:53] <gnarf> anything that was using /\.data\( "ui-([^-"]+)" \)/ got changed
[08:40:28] <jzaefferer> except those in tests/unit?
[08:40:50] <gnarf> yeah, i didn't want to mess with the units (other than adding one for instance)
[08:41:27] <gnarf> i figured a second pass over em would be fine at a later date, plus SOME of those uses of .data() in the tests should stay to be testing storage locations

[08:43:05] <gnarf> i got my new nexus 4

[08:43:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there a replacement for find(":data(ui-…")? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js#L154-L155
[08:43:26] <jzaefferer> Its a nice phone, isn't it?
[08:43:33] <jzaefferer> Also, Ingress?
[08:43:47] <jzaefferer> Along with an external battery, the Nexus 4 works pretty well for that
[08:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: No replacement.
[08:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is if the plugin isn't loaded, there's no API to use.
[08:48:06] <jzaefferer> Getting or settings .data no longer triggers any events in newer jQuery versions, right?

[10:06:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I feel like either myself or someone else asked you already, but have we tried doing a manual export of the CLA signatures, then feeding that file into something locally?
[10:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need constantly do that.
[10:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> It would defeat the purpose of automating.
[10:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> There are genearlly multiple signatures every day.
[10:08:39] <jzaefferer> I guess it would only help when working through a backlog of missing signatures..
[10:08:47] <jzaefferer> which is not really worth automating
[10:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly not, since it's equally as fast to search within the document.
