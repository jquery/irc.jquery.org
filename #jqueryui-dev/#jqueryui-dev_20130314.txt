[03:10:58] <legec> hi there
[03:11:56] <legec> " http://jqueryui.com/download/ " gives me a 502 error when I try to download the jquery-ui bundle
[03:13:12] <legec> on the download page itself, I do not see the "Theme" choice menu

[03:27:10] <Dracco> Hello everyone!
[03:27:10] <Dracco> I have problem downloading jqueryui with custom build (no matter is it basic or custom theme). After picking necessary elements I get a 502 Bad Gateway error. Any ideas what could be wrong? Modules I mark are: Core, Widget, Position, Accordion, Button, Tabs, Tooltip, though not working for all marks as well.
[03:46:23] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #214: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/214/
[04:24:54] <rxaviers> last two exceptions were https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5160594
[04:32:00] <Dracco> Ok it works now :).
[05:00:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is simple-log's source hosted somewhere? I didnt find it on github...
[05:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/node-logger
[05:32:08] <rxaviers> Af. I've searched on github for the README words. I should have tried on google as well using "". Thks
[05:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, I guess I should flesh out the package.json so that https://npmjs.org/package/simple-log is more useful
[05:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's bare because it wasn't intended to be published on npm originally.
[05:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> We were just resolving the depencdency with a git URL
[05:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> But we quickly learned about how bad that is.
[05:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably move it out of the jquery org now that it's on npm.
[05:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Download builder is good now?
[05:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> What was happening with all the errors over night?
[05:51:55] <rxaviers> nope
[05:51:56] <rxaviers> 1sec
[05:52:17] <rxaviers> plz
[06:04:46] <rxaviers> sorry for the delay
[06:05:36] <rxaviers> I focused on the last error, which I suppose is why server crashed
[06:05:54] <rxaviers> it's about caching TR images.
[06:06:50] <rxaviers> it's quick to make a fix a prevent server from keep crashing this way. Although, I still did not understand why it happened.
[06:06:54] <rxaviers> fix and*

[08:26:58] <jzaefferer> I can set a few things on fire :p
[08:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[09:16:48] <ryanneufeld> `tell scott_gonzalez I'm gonna take a look at this, https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159 but I don't know what change you made.
[09:16:48] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: I’ll tell scott_gonzalez about that.
[10:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Did you get that fixed?
[10:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> All I did was add https to the URL in config.json.
[10:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No issues since that last deploy, right?
[10:40:59] <rxaviers> right
[10:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:41:05] <rxaviers> :)
[10:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna do one more dry run for the release.
[10:42:17] <rxaviers> ok
[10:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so this base theme still existing actually is an issue.
[10:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> Because now it exists, but is broken.
[10:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you know how to get the base theme out of the cdn zip?
[10:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what is copying it into the zip.
[11:08:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, put me in the loop, how do you get this zip? release_themes?
[11:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> release_cdn
[11:10:09] <rxaviers> thks
[11:10:13] <rxaviers> checking
[11:14:00] <rxaviers> where are you look at dist/jquery-ui-themes-1.10.2pre.zip?
[11:14:29] <rxaviers> the above has no base to me
[11:15:55] <rxaviers> ah, jquery-ui-1.10.2pre-cdn.zip right.
[11:16:00] <rxaviers> yeap this one does.. checking
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 		cdn_min_images: {
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 			src: "themes/base/images/*",
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 			strip: /^themes\/base\//,

[11:20:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I think this is what we need https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5163826

[11:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Are you able to do a tree comparison to verify that's the only thing that changd?
[11:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, you can just run a diff on the MANIFEST file inside the cdn directory.
[11:30:20] <rxaviers> sure ok
[11:40:01] <rxaviers> comparing MANIFEST, I see diff md5 for theme images.. investigating
[11:46:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, base is gone. Although, some theme images got a different md5. https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5164062
[11:46:26] <rxaviers> I've opened some in editor and they seemed the same.
[11:46:29] <rxaviers> visually
[11:46:48] <rxaviers> sizes are the same
[11:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[11:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you run it again, do you get differnet md5s again?
[11:48:17] <rxaviers> let me try (i was looking its exif info..)
[11:50:34] <rxaviers> ha! It did, it's diff
[11:50:55] <rxaviers> making a 3rd run to see if they are all diff among themselves
[11:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:51:35] <rxaviers> (above I compared two post-fix-cdn MANIFEST)
[11:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> silly IM
[11:51:46] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, that's probably always been the case then.
[11:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> Commit that change and I'll do the release for real.
[12:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Are you committing that?
[12:01:33] <rxaviers> just did it

[12:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...probably not the best idea to run the release script on our servers.
[12:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's a super resource hog.
[12:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> At least it's on a stage.
[12:19:32] <rxaviers> :(
[12:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> We use shelljs, which makes everything act as if it were sync.
[12:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> In order to do that, it pegs the CPU.
[12:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well...

[16:41:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: hooray on 1.10.2!
[16:42:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: did you ever get around to writing a test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/054449e214449ec5578fe71bb67b9a670adac828
[16:42:37] <b-ot> mikesherov: Scott González (1d 20h ago): Sortable: Only animate along the specified axis when reverting. Fixes #7415 - Sortable: Incorrect revert animation with axis: 'y'.
[17:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Nope. Did you see my gist?
[17:47:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no, but I'm writing the test for you as we speak
[17:47:46] <mikesherov> did you know that ui.position is undefined in the sortable "start" event?
[17:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> I did not.
[17:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: This is what I was trying to do for a test: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5153256
[17:49:55] <mikesherov> hmmm
[17:51:16] <mikesherov> why are you starting on stop? don't you want to start after the assertion?
[17:51:26] <mikesherov> a failure will fail in the wrong test
[17:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[17:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> The animation should finish before the test finishes.
[17:52:16] <mikesherov> because you've started before the assertion
[17:52:26] <mikesherov> oh, duh
[17:52:27] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:52:48] <mikesherov> I always forget stop fires after the revert anim
[17:53:39] <mikesherov> oh, so then I think that's fine
[17:53:47] <mikesherov> I would also want to check ui.position
[17:54:12] <mikesherov> but there's no way to inspect ui.position during the anim cleanly
[17:54:14] <mikesherov> right?
[17:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> right
[17:54:33] <mikesherov> OK, then I think what you have is fine
[17:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't seem to work :-/
[17:54:54] <mikesherov> except, that'll fail in IE9
[17:55:03] <mikesherov> because left isn't auto there
[17:55:15] <mikesherov> IE is the only one who converts to pixel as of this moment
[17:55:24] <mikesherov> and chrome will be changing to px soon too
[17:56:41] <mikesherov> so I'll debug your test
[17:56:57] <mikesherov> because I'm testing the plain axis options at the moment
[17:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if you can figure out a proper thest, that'd be great :-)
[17:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't figure out how to do it :-(
[17:57:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^ In the tests, I suppose I should be checking ui.position if i can, and then also "visually" by inspecting css properties like you're doing
[17:58:34] <mikesherov> I didn't do that in #8792, I only checked that the events fired properly
[17:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the bug was only about the revert animation.
[17:58:53] <mikesherov> anyway, that's something I'll revisit later
[17:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> So ui.position isn't really relevant for that bug.
[17:58:57] <mikesherov> right
[17:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> But is relevant for testing axis.
[17:59:04] <mikesherov> right
[17:59:16] <mikesherov> in the axis test, I'll test ui.position
[17:59:24] <mikesherov> and for that bug I'll test css position
[17:59:26] <mikesherov> ok, g2g
[18:35:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: quick question… is ui.position supposed to reflect the visual position of the item? because for current sortable, the axis option only prevents styles from being applied… doesn't do anything to prevent mutation of ui.position
[18:35:59] <mikesherov> :-\
[18:36:23] <mikesherov> man, now I know why you wanted to ditch them completely :-\
[18:37:56] <mikesherov> anyway, I'll note it for the future
[18:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well, in 2.0, it should just force the value of ui.position because then the widget will look at that and not move it.
[18:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> But for current, we should probably just do whatever we're doing so that we don't break any code.
[18:48:13] <mikesherov> right, not going to change code to appease tests
[18:48:35] <mikesherov> I'll just make the tests test apparent visual behavior, and note that in 2.0, it'll test that AND ui.position
