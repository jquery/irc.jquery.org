[04:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: This looks like a duplicate, but I can't find the other ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9218
[04:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> Do you remember this?
[04:23:48] <mikesherov> yes
[04:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> The summary is misleading.
[04:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> Since the problem only exists when the element is also resizable.
[04:25:17] <mikesherov> right
[04:25:26] <mikesherov> and the ticket name itself sucks too
[04:25:33] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5912
[04:25:43] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7016
[04:26:16] <mikesherov> and actually, I disagree with tj that it's a real dupe
[04:26:21] <mikesherov> but yeah, those are there
[04:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to re-open 7016 and mark it as blocked by 5912
[04:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> Then close the new ticket as a dupe of 7016
[04:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[04:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> 7016 really is a dupe of 5912
[04:32:43] <mikesherov> right
[04:32:57] <mikesherov> I meant that the name on the ticket dosn't make it a dupe
[04:33:23] <mikesherov> and in fact, I tried changing it and it didn't make a difference for me
[04:33:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you can get the issue to go away by removing scrollWidth?

[05:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sorry, had to get the kids ready. Gonna check now.
[05:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: No, removing scrollWidth doesn't fix it for me.
[05:08:35] <mikesherov> right, so how is it the same?
[05:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to just reversing this and closing 5912 as a duplicate of 7016?
[05:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or even just closing 5912 as invalid and pointing to 7016.
[05:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> Since 5912 is about an implementation detail and the ticket itself is wrong.
[05:11:38] <mikesherov> that's fine
[05:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> I love how Trac is smart about deleting comments.
[05:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> I deleted the comment that said 7016 was a dupe and it automatically reopened the ticket.
[05:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> But it doesn't mark it as reopened, it just reverts the state :-)
[05:26:49] <DasSaffe> hey dudes, someone up for a little shot?  $( "#amount_rate" ).val( $( "#zinscheck_rate" ).slider( "value" ) ); <-- why can't I manipulate my slider afterwards? (not the value, the displayed fill-color of the slider. I can pastebin my complete-code if it'll help

[11:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Hopefully this will bring some sanity to your life ^^^
[11:23:24] <mikesherov> hooray
[11:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't test it, so we'll just have to wait and see.
[11:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> But the names should now be in the form "jQuery UI #xxxxx core 1.8"
[11:24:23] <mikesherov> btw, I'm aware I broke the datepicker tests in old jquery
[11:24:59] <mikesherov> I'm trying to find a cross browser, cross jQuery way of dealing with focus() and blur()
[11:25:16] <mikesherov> the event changes from 1.6 to 1.7 to 1.8 make me slightly nauseous 
[11:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we settled on DOMElement.focus()
[11:25:37] <mikesherov> sure
[11:25:54] <mikesherov> except firefox hates that if you focus then blur then focus
[11:26:04] <mikesherov> and when you do that, you can't use one()
[11:26:16] <mikesherov> because you have to ignore the non jQuery event
[11:26:25] <mikesherov> and you have to feature detect event.OriginalEvent
[11:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:26:51] <mikesherov> so I have something that work now in all IE, FF, Chrome for all supported jQuery
[11:27:01] <mikesherov> EXCEPT IE8 in Windows 8
[11:27:07] <mikesherov> BELIEVE IT OR NOT
[11:27:20] <mikesherov> I'll land something shortly, you'll want to cry
[11:28:04] <mikesherov> https://gist.github.com/mikesherov/5348106 works everywhere except IE8????
[11:28:08] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:28:25] <mikesherov> and what I actually need to do
[11:28:28] <mikesherov> ohhhh
[11:28:30] <mikesherov> I think I got it
[11:28:40] <mikesherov> I need to unbind the specific function
[11:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> $( "*" ).unbind( "*" )
[11:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> WHY DOESN'T MY CODE WORK?!?!?!
[11:30:16] <mikesherov> haha
[12:14:28] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I assume you're aware of the broken tests in Chrome for ui?

[12:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: You should read the backlog in here...
[12:27:23] <Krinkle> Thx
[13:32:55] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez i'm getting ready for "test the web forward", did  you make any progress on touch events?
[13:33:01] <DaveMethvin> if not np
[13:33:19] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling there is a significant learning curve 
[13:33:33] <DaveMethvin> as far as how to write tests in general
[14:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I did :-)
[14:52:42] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[14:52:48] <DaveMethvin> wherezat?
[14:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/
[14:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically in tests/pointerevents-v1/submissions/jQuery/pointerdown.html
[14:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> The assertions we want to test are documented at http://www.w3.org/wiki/PointerEvents/TestAssertions
[14:55:37] <DaveMethvin> awesome, I'll need to study those and see how to build on them
[14:55:59] <DaveMethvin> jacob rossi will be at the event so that will provide some continuity
[14:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> I added the 1.x assertions to pointerdown.html in a second pass.
[14:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> So now I'm thinking of just renaming the file and adding more tests.
[14:56:59] <DaveMethvin> oh man i guess i need to install mercurial? the event seemed to indicate we were using git
[14:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery/ponterdown.html covers everything that Nokia/webidl_pointerevent.html covers.
[14:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> So you can just ignore the Nokia submission.
[14:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> I wish we were using git.
[14:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> I had to install mercurial for this.
[14:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> I still don't understand how it works.
[14:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> But as long as nobody else commits and `hg pull` is a no-op, I'm good :-P
[14:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> When I first tried to push, there were other commits that had been pushed since my last pull.
[14:58:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> And I couldn't figure out how to get into a working state.
[14:58:44] <DaveMethvin> well they seem to be using git for the event 
[14:58:46] <DaveMethvin> http://testthewebforward.org/events/seattle-2013.html
[14:58:52] <DaveMethvin> see "requirements"
[14:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> I ended up deleting and re-cloning.
[14:59:16] <DaveMethvin> maybe they're keeping the work firewalled and importing it later
[14:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[15:00:13] <DaveMethvin> got a meeting in a sec, but I'll take a look at this later
[15:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> The link for Pointer Events does go to mercurial.
[15:00:40] <DaveMethvin> :(
[15:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Even though the "Before you begin" section only mentions git.
[15:01:02] <DaveMethvin> installing anything on windows is always a multi-day challenge
[15:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the Pointer Events link is just for the spec.
[15:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the good news is that pointerdown.html is self-contained.
[15:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> So you can just copy the file and work on it outside of mercurial.
