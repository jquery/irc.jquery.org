[01:30:29] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[02:27:15] <ThiefMaster|work> hi
[02:27:18] <ThiefMaster|work> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7322 - please reopen, that commit did not fully fix it (see the last comment)
[02:27:49] <ThiefMaster|work> ah nvm, looks like someone from #jquery already did it
[02:32:50] <gnarf> yeah
[02:32:55] <gnarf> thx for repasting here anyway
[02:33:13] <gnarf> was gonna ask you more about the problem, but i saw it eventually :)
[02:33:22] <gnarf> read over the word "firefox" a few times

[05:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> it's gone now
[05:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> that bug is blocking 1.8.13
[05:24:22] <gnarf> i think it was 1.9 before it was closed
[05:24:40] <gnarf> yeah
[05:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, not used to having the appropriate milestone to choose for blocker bugs
[05:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> we didn't start creating the 1.8.x milestones ahead of time until we branched
[05:30:49] <ThiefMaster|work> when you are messing with the number of rows.. any chance that you could add an option to override it via an option?
[05:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> ThiefMaster|work: why would you want to override it?
[05:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> datepicker has way too many options as it is
[05:31:19] <ThiefMaster|work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5470805/synchronize-row-count-of-two-jquery-ui-datepickers
[05:31:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: for his start/end date picker :)
[05:31:27] <ThiefMaster|work> yeah
[05:31:41] <ThiefMaster|work> right now i'm patching the code manually
[05:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> can you add a comment on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker
[05:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> we're rewriting datepicker from scratch and it's going to use templating
[05:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> so hopefully that makes this stuff easier to customize
[05:32:49] <ThiefMaster|work> ok
[05:34:04] <ThiefMaster|work> scott_gonzalez: no access to post a comment
[05:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> there should be a sign up link on the top right
[05:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> we give everyone access, but we require logins to control spam
[05:35:24] <ThiefMaster|work> "Your request to join this workspace has been sent to the administrato" hmm. i guess that was the wrong one
[05:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> no, that's right
[05:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> it gets sent to me
[05:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> approved
[05:36:48] <gnarf> ?boom
[05:36:49] <bot-t> Did you are unimpressed? and now?
[05:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> we usually can't tell if someone's a spammer when they sign up, but as soon as they spam a single page, we can delete the account
[05:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> we get notifications for every change
[05:38:35] <ThiefMaster|work> yeah, those spam bots are annoying
[05:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do you have time to look into that datepicker bug?
[05:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> about the year dropdown disappearing?
[05:58:15] <jzaefferer> unless we don't because someone turns notifications off...
[05:58:32] <gnarf> jzaefferer / scott_gonzalez: is there a chance there is a "not in this array" test function?
[05:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> $.inArray() !== -1
[05:59:07] <gnarf> yeah, i was hoping for one in qunit
[05:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> you could do equal( $.inArray(), -1 )
[05:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> nope, QUnit only has the most basic assertions
[05:59:53] <gnarf> was thinking like notPresent( value, [ value1, value2 ], "value is not value1 or value 2" )
[06:00:07] <gnarf> so that the possible "values" could be logged in the test result too
[06:00:33] <jzaefferer> yeah, I'm adding that right after the assertEverythingIsShinyUnicorns assertions :-)
[06:00:58] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sigh, i guess i just write my own alias :)
[06:01:25] <jzaefferer> you can actually hook into QUnit.push and QUnit.equiv to create a nice custom assertion
[06:01:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: doubtful i'll have time for it today
[06:01:48] <jzaefferer> see the explanation of domEqual here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/gg749824.aspx
[06:01:56] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i have a couple of unit tests for effects where i want to assert that it isn't start or end while in the middle
[06:02:31] <jzaefferer> if you use QUnit.push, you'll get correct filename/linenumbers
[06:05:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: thx for the protip, i'll dig into it after breakfast
[08:08:18] <gnarf> jzaefferer: this seem right: https://gist.github.com/968692 ?
[08:20:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just wrote some animateClass unit tests, should I include them in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/154 ?
[08:20:32] <gnarf> or should i just push em over into a separate pull?
[08:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> separate
[08:20:58] <gnarf> one of them tests the new function from that pull
[08:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> you can send a separate pull for tests of existing functionality
[08:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> or you can just do it all in this pull
[08:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> it just makes reviewing the pulls trickier
[08:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> I end up looking at individual commits
[08:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> like that pull already includes whitespace and quote changes
[08:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> which get reviewed separately
[08:25:06] <gnarf> right
[08:25:32] <gnarf> I just don't like fixing a feature in a non-style code block
[08:25:54] <gnarf> i figure you could at least cherry pick the style guidance commits if i keep them style guidance only :)
[08:27:10] <gnarf> so i filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/260 it doesn't include the tests that would fail master currently
[08:27:34] <gnarf> but i need that commit to make the other unit test work :)

[08:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> yay, blocker's fixed
[09:13:39] <ThiefMaster|work> ah nice
[09:14:01] <ThiefMaster|work> so i can finally upgrade to 1.8.12 (with the fix applied) before jquery gets added to our project
[09:21:51] <ThiefMaster|work> aw, found another bug
[09:22:34] <ThiefMaster|work> when the end year is fixed and you press the "next month" button the select field switches back to the lowest year but the datepicker's value is in a higher year than allowed
[09:23:17] <ThiefMaster|work> it even shows the correct year for a short moment but then falls back to the lowest one (and when opening the year list it doesn't contain the "bad" one)

[09:39:32] <ThiefMaster|work> aw, looks like that bug report is a bit too late for 1.8.13 ;x
[12:15:52] <borismoore> Does anyone have access to the jQuery UI Wiki - and know if we can change the meta tag?
[12:16:15] <borismoore> Currently it has <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE8"/> which is leading to some issues for nested IFRAMEs in IE
[12:16:36] <borismoore> If we could change it to <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=9"/> it looks like if would fix the issues
[12:17:03] <borismoore> Specifically for this page http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39761893/Grid-ObservableData
[12:22:13] <RWhitbeck> borismoore rworth might know more but I suspect we would have to talk with pbwiki to get that changed.
[12:23:11] <borismoore> I'll send mail to Richard... thanks...
[12:24:17] <RWhitbeck> borismoore he's in Brazil so it might be a while before he responds
[12:24:49] <borismoore> Yup, I know, thanks. It'll be in his inbox. Not a problem, not really urgent...
[12:25:05] <RWhitbeck> k just setting expectations
[12:27:10] <borismoore> Yes, thanks Ralph, appreciate it :)
[13:58:36] <jzaefferer> borismoore, just contacting their support directly is probably the way to go
[14:36:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm out of reasons not to pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/203 -- I'm still a little wierded out about the whole effect of course, but I think the "toggling" behavior makes sense (so long as I document it)

[18:06:05] <gnarf> if you pull 7356
[18:06:06] <gnarf> that is
[18:06:08] <gnarf> sry
[18:06:12] <gnarf> got my ticket backwards
[18:06:13] <gnarf> oops
[18:07:55] <gnarf> those darn numbers blending together
[18:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> done

[18:10:04] <gnarf> :/ darnit
[18:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[18:10:28] <gnarf> the commit / comment in code was wrong ticket
[18:10:31] <gnarf> i totally failed
[18:10:35] <gnarf> :/
[18:10:44] <gnarf> should be 3939 (children)
[18:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> oh, hehe
[18:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> too late
[18:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> could've been worse
[18:11:13] <gnarf> ill fix it in my next effects_unit branch
[18:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> could've been in a format that Trac would pick up
[18:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok, done for the day
[18:12:57] <gnarf> me too
[18:13:01] * gnarf waves
[18:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> oh, one request for you
[18:13:23] <gnarf> shoot
[18:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> can you tweak the animateClass implementation to check if there are any props to change?
[18:13:57] <scott_gonzalez> could be a big perf improvement for children: true
[18:14:09] <gnarf> not that big
[18:14:12] <gnarf> empty animate
[18:14:18] <gnarf> right?
[18:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> is that _ hack gone?
[18:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> guess so
[18:15:30] <gnarf> i think that map / when owned 3939
[18:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> so what happens on .animate({}) ?
[18:16:34] <gnarf> if empty call complete
[18:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok, yeah, no perf change
[18:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[18:17:00] <gnarf> my only thought
[18:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> just completes immediately, resolving the deferred, which will just wait on the other deferreds anyway
[18:17:09] <gnarf> i could shave a few if i returned null from that second map
[18:17:14] <gnarf> if its empty
[18:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it'd be a bit of an improvement
[18:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> but the big problem I was thinking of doesn't exist
[18:17:48] <gnarf> awesome
[18:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> we used to hack around a bug in core
[18:17:59] * gnarf dodges big problem
[18:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> and we'd always have at least 1 dummy property to animate
[18:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> so that would've been really bad for lots of children
[18:18:24] <gnarf> yeah we droppe that in the huge rewrite b this one
[18:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[18:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> have a good night
[18:18:55] <gnarf> u2
[20:01:03] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano yt?
[20:01:21] <ajpiano> what's up
[20:01:59] <RWhitbeck> do you know what is the latest version of jQuery that jQuery UI 1.8.12 supports?  1.5.2?
[20:02:43] <ajpiano> yes
[20:03:00] <RWhitbeck> k thanks
[23:38:43] <sshaginyan> CAn someone help me?
