[13:58:46] <barraponto> can someone review/commit this patch http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7862 ?
[13:58:52] <barraponto> i mean, it's a oneliner.
[14:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> barraponto: That's already fixed.
[14:12:36] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, hello guys, I'm trying to login in trac, but no success. Actually, I dont even know if I have a user there. I tried to reset my passwd. It says a new passwd has been sent to my email. But got nothing.
[14:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'll fix it.
[14:13:58] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez
[14:14:08] <jzaefferer> on site already?
[14:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> hey jzaefferer
[14:15:08] <jzaefferer> now that rxaviers landed the error handling for the fetchImage method, I'll update that in the grunt task (sometime tomorrow)
[14:15:14] <jzaefferer> or maybe now...
[14:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:19:25] <barraponto> scott_gonzalez: oh, i thought it was still an open bug...
[14:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> It is, that commit is not close to a full fix.
[14:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> By "that's already fixed" I meant the commit you asked about is already merged.

[14:33:36] <scott_gonzalez> This hotel wifi is horrible.
[14:34:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about the logger question at fetchImages, should it logger.log plus keep console.error it?
[14:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> We probably shouldn't console.* anything on servers.
[14:34:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, gnarf, all, When going to the Summit I was wondering paying for a 3G. Is there any 1 month plan in US? Any suggestions?
[14:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer will probably have an answer for that.
[14:35:25] <rxaviers> :)
[14:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The logger module has log, warn, and error.
[14:35:45] <rxaviers> rxaviers, ok, will stick with logger only then
[14:36:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about that ^. Shall I remove `console.error( "Caught exception ...` in server.js then?
[14:36:43] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: in SF, t-mobile was the only option - $50 for 100mb at 4G, then slowed down to 2g or something. $10 more to get 1GB. All (national?) calls included though
[14:36:54] <jzaefferer> for a full month
[14:37:05] <jzaefferer> everyone else claimed they suck
[14:37:15] <jzaefferer> like verizon claims their stuff wouldn't work
[14:37:44] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: when developing, we can launch with --console to get those errors on the console
[14:37:52] <rxaviers> wow cool, in Brazil we barely have a 3G working properly
[14:38:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, how is it like? A pre paid plan? I pay and get a slim card for 1 month?
[14:39:05] <jzaefferer> I can get 200mb 4G flat + national phone calls + text messages flat rate for 25€ here...
[14:39:18] <jzaefferer> sim card for 1 month, pre paid, yeah
[14:39:26] <rxaviers> ops sim*
[14:39:42] <rxaviers> germany rocks
[14:39:46] <jzaefferer> what phone do you have?
[14:39:52] <rxaviers> an iphone 3gs
[14:41:15] <rxaviers> in brazil, I pay ~ R$130,00 for 200mb 3G (which falls down to edge) + 400min phone call
[14:42:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, are you ok with that change?
[14:42:52] <rxaviers> http://pastie.org/4787694
[14:42:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, that should work
[14:43:29] <rxaviers> (R$130 ~= usd 65)
[14:43:41] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, alright
[14:43:44] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, that looks good

[14:46:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers scott_gonzalez: valid error handling inside an async.forEach? https://gist.github.com/ef47aca9e04b40efdafa
[14:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: worksforme
[14:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Are you up to date?
[14:48:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, or you need to callback( error )? checking.
[14:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Shouldn't you call done( false ) and log instead of throwing?
[14:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, done() isn't this.async().
[14:49:38] <rxaviers> https://github.com/caolan/async/#forEach
[14:49:59] <rxaviers> I think callback(err) makes async.forEach handles it properly
[14:50:05] <rxaviers> handle*
[14:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> You should call done( error )
[14:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to change the callback for forEach() though, since this.async() doesn't support the standard error as first param signture.
[14:57:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, how do you want me to comment in the bugs? "Fixed in 1.9.0" is fine for the fixed ones?
[14:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> You can just add a comment "Fixed in the rewrite." But leave them open.
[15:00:26] <rxaviers> Ok thks

[18:30:02] <rxaviers> gnarf, Hi Corey. Just saw your comment
[18:30:42] <rxaviers> You're saying this because we're comparing with 0, right?
[18:32:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: RE the pull - I am pretty sure that "bugfix" was in git only, which is why I merged it without a ticket.  RE the ticket without the version, its so old I don't remember
[18:44:32] <rxaviers> gnarf, approved? http://pastie.org/4788622
[18:44:34] <rxaviers> :)
[18:50:25] <gnarf> rxaviers: !length "has no length"
[18:50:37] <gnarf> i use it a lot
[18:51:30] <rxaviers> rxaviers, yeah pretty good. Better thks
[18:51:42] <gnarf> talkin to yourself now i see
[18:51:46] <gnarf> ;)
[18:52:00] <rxaviers> af!
[18:52:01] <rxaviers> haha
[18:52:16] <rxaviers> time to go to sleep
[18:53:06] <rxaviers> gnarf, thanks to your review, I passed jshints in other .js's and found one more thing
[18:53:18] <rxaviers> ;) so double thks
[18:53:28] <gnarf> yeah the only thing we use == for btw
[18:53:29] <gnarf> is null
[18:53:35] <gnarf> because null == undefined
[18:53:45] <gnarf> so if you want to check for one or the other, you can double equal
