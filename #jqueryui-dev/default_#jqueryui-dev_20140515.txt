[09:07:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[09:08:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping
[09:08:27] <arschmitz> pong
[09:08:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[09:08:36] <arschmitz> something with a small paddle
[09:08:42] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:08:58] <_|Nix|_> What does "check with download builder" mean? Does it apply to existing widgets?
[09:09:02] <_|Nix|_> Can I check that off?
[09:09:21] <arschmitz> it means try making a build with the download builder and make sure it works
[09:09:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, OK.
[09:10:03] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's actually kind of equivalent to adding an entry under tests/unit/individual-modules
[09:10:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i should probably make instructions for that
[09:10:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really that does not test meta comments
[09:10:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, you mean what it looks like in the download builder?
[09:10:55] <arschmitz> i mean actually use download builder
[09:10:59] <arschmitz> to test it
[09:11:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm assuming you mean to create a buid containing exclusively the widget, and build a page with the resulting build. Right?
[09:11:40] <arschmitz> which i should probably add instructions for
[09:11:41] <arschmitz> yes
[09:11:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:11:48] <_|Nix|_> Can do.
[09:12:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Og course, I could use some help deploying DB locally.
[09:12:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you shouldnt need to just jquerymobile.com
[09:13:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do I specify that I wish DB to be based on branch 7360-table-review?
[09:14:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/pages/download-builder.html#L20
[09:14:24] <arschmitz> in your local jquerymobile.com add an entry to that select for your branch
[09:15:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I thought you meant that I could do it on http://jquerymobile.com/
[09:15:19] <arschmitz> oh no sorry
[09:15:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I need to clone jquerymobile.com and deploy it locally.
[09:15:26] <arschmitz> yes
[09:15:32] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[09:15:49] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... this'll be interesting.
[09:18:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nevermind it wont work
[09:19:06] <arschmitz> it will require a local download builder
[09:19:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, that's what I'm trying to get going, but it's not at all like the API docs.
[09:19:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not seeing a Gruntfile.js nor a package.json
[09:19:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no you need to setup gseguin node-amd-builder local
[09:20:15] <arschmitz> and then repoint jquerymobile.com to that
[09:20:26] <arschmitz> and jquerymobile.com is just like api.jquerymobile.com
[09:21:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... except I can't grunt wordpress-deploy, because there's no Gruntfile.js
[09:21:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: use vagrant
[09:22:02] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm lost.
[09:23:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you should always run grunt deploy and it does have a grunt file https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/grunt.js
[09:23:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and yeah you should just use the vagrant box for jquerymobile,com
[09:23:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right. grunt 0.3.
[09:23:51] <_|Nix|_> I must've been blind.
[09:24:17] <_|Nix|_> You guys are speaking in tongues: "use the vagrant box for jquerymobile,com"
[09:24:38] <arschmitz> yeah and package.json is there too or we could not deploy the site live https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/package.json
[09:24:48] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll try with grunt first.
[09:24:53] <arschmitz> read the readme for jquery wp content
[09:25:09] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sorry. I had forgotten that the sites use grunt 0.3.
[09:25:36] <arschmitz> the jquery-wp-content readme explains how to run these using a vgrant box
[09:25:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've been able to grunt deploy
[09:26:02] <arschmitz> and it should be fine if your on linux ( there are some issues ryanneufeld and i are still working on for windows )
[09:26:26] <ryanneufeld> I think those issues were resolved... no?
[09:26:32] <_|Nix|_> Oh, no! It's deploying to api.jquerymobile.com :)
[09:26:38] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: were they i thought we never finished?
[09:27:11] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i thought we hoped they would be with the 32 bit vm but last build i got you had to fix something in 
[09:27:24] <arschmitz> its been a long time though maybe im crazy
[09:31:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I was able to deploy jquerymobile.com locally.
[09:36:19] <arschmitz> node amd builder is the tricky part
[09:36:31] <arschmitz> i had to skype with gseguin before i got it lol
[09:36:41] <arschmitz> i still need to submit a pr to improve the readme for it 
[09:37:02] * gseguin is sorry for the lack of documentation
[09:37:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: thats still on my todo list :)
[09:37:30] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... It was working for a while, but now I'm just getting a spinner.
[09:37:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: my second try was fine when i could refrence the directory structure 
[09:37:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it will work for any tag or master
[09:37:57] <arschmitz> but not for other branches
[09:38:23] <gseguin> it will work for branches too
[09:38:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's been spinning for a while now. Does the PHP connect to github to grab the branch?
[09:38:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: i mean the install for jquerymobile.com
[09:38:48] <_|Nix|_> I dunno what happened. It was working, and I refresh the page, and now it just spins and does not display the list of modules.
[09:38:51] <arschmitz> gseguin: its setup to only have workspaces for tags and master
[09:39:41] <gseguin> if you checkout the branch manually in the staging area it should work
[09:39:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[09:40:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i know but we dont want people logging into the server and manually checkout out branches to test widgets :)
[09:40:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... do I need to give it write permission to some directories?
[09:40:26] <gseguin> arschmitz: true
[09:40:32] <_|Nix|_> I don't understand why it worked and now it doesn't.
[09:40:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you installed node-amd-builder and started it?
[09:40:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, no. Is that a daemon?
[09:40:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the user that runs the service should own the directories
[09:41:24] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm beginning to see the picture.
[09:42:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and you need to change https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/resources/builder/builder.js#L2
[09:42:17] <arschmitz> to point to you local builder
[09:44:59] <_|Nix|_> How do I launch the daemon?

[09:45:45] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I have to deploy the builder as well?
[09:47:16] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: yup totally anytime

[09:47:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: How do I deploy the builder?
[09:47:41] <ryanneufeld> and lemme know what heppens
[09:47:51] <arschmitz> i have meeting at 2 and one at 3 
[09:47:53] <arschmitz> ish
[09:48:11] <arschmitz> but the 3ish one is just with s5fs :)
[09:49:44] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: any news on the css-framework?
[09:50:28] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I started to push commits this afternoon and I will keep doing that until everything is on the repo
[09:50:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i have addressed all your comments in button-icon-span
[09:51:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: still working on adding NEW tests so may want to hold off until i finish that
[09:51:20] <arschmitz> but thought id let you know
[09:51:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay, let me know when the tests are done, seems like a better time to test stuff
[09:52:04] <arschmitz> yup
[09:52:10] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: I should crash your meeting w/ s5fs :p
[09:52:13] <ryanneufeld> just for fun
[09:52:13] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: git complains about CRLF: warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in font/src/LICENSE.txt.
[09:53:09] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: go for it you might be interested in it :)
[09:53:47] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: other then that, nice to actually see something :-)
[09:54:24] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: what do I need to do to see that warning?
[09:55:00] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: are you on a Windows machine?
[09:55:08] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: no, on mac
[09:55:39] <jzaefferer> I get that warning as soon as I run any command, e.g. "git status"
[09:56:42] <jzaefferer> I don't know how to get it to check for that when it doesn't
[09:56:56] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I don't get the warning when I run git status but I do see now that it is listed there as modified while I didn't touch it
[09:57:16] <uGoMobi> I hear gseguin|away always complain about that
[09:59:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: do you know how I can resolve that? ^^^
[10:02:52] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: did you ever got a chance to make a backup of the jquerymobile.com WP database? https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/62#issuecomment-36111038
[10:03:45] <uGoMobi> still have to remove Disqus to prevent those shabby ads 
[10:06:46] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: what are you guys talking about?
[10:07:01] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: I have not. I'll put it on my list
[10:07:11] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ok, thanks
[10:08:12] <ryanneufeld> do you need a regular backup? or a one-shot?
[10:09:15] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: what do you mean by a one-shot?
[10:09:23] <ryanneufeld> a one time backup
[10:09:31] <ryanneufeld> vs a regular scheduled backup
[10:09:43] <ryanneufeld> isn't jquerymobile.com on the new system?
[10:10:00] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: what I need is that when removing Disqus goes wrong I want to be able to replace the database with the backup version
[10:10:28] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I think gnarf said the WP database wasn't part of the scheduled backup
[10:10:44] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/62#issuecomment-35902787
[10:12:56] <ryanneufeld> oh, this is blog.
[10:12:58] <ryanneufeld> right
[10:13:01] <ryanneufeld> gotcha
[10:13:32] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: should it be regularly backed up?
[10:13:56] <ryanneufeld> or do you just want a quick restore in case the disqus removal goes bad?
[10:14:20] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: just a quick restore
[10:14:25] <ryanneufeld> ok
[10:14:30] <uGoMobi> thanks
[10:16:08] <uGoMobi> if I am not mistaken jquery-wp-content uses VaultPress for backup
[10:16:34] <uGoMobi> if so we will probably going to use that for blog.* too in the future

[10:48:18] <ryanneufeld> like, why would you issue those commands in that order?

[10:48:54] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:49:32] <gseguin> 'cause you can't stash those
[10:52:22] <ryanneufeld> and a clean -fdx wouldn't fix it?
[12:14:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[12:14:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, I've started the amd-builder server, and I've pointed builder.js at it.
[12:14:52] <gseguin> _|Nix|: yo
[12:14:59] <gseguin> ok
[12:15:04] <_|Nix|_> Yet I can't display the checklist for my branch.
[12:15:08] <_|Nix|_> It shows up blank.
[12:15:22] <gseguin> did you check out the repo?
[12:15:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The jquery-mobile repo?
[12:15:46] <gseguin> yeah
[12:15:53] <gseguin> these are manual steps
[12:16:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The weird thing is, it produces a checklist for all the tags and master even if I don't check it out.
[12:16:34] <gseguin> hmm...
[12:16:46] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait.
[12:16:55] <gseguin> what's in your <staging>/jquery ?
[12:16:55] <_|Nix|_> It's still pointed at amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[12:17:05] <gseguin> oh that's why
[12:18:14] <_|Nix|_> OK. I've deployed the changes locally. Lessee ...
[12:18:18] <_|Nix|_> Should crash and burn now.
[12:18:27] <_|Nix|_> ... because I haven't checked out jquery-mobile yet.
[12:19:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, now it's just spinning and spinning and spinning ...
[12:19:16] <gseguin> yeah that's normal
[12:19:30] <gseguin> did you check out the bare repo in repo/jquery ?
[12:19:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome! The node-amd-builder is actually outputting it's responses on the console!
[12:19:59] <_|Nix|_> That's great feedback!
[12:20:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I followed the instructions in the README.md literally. I created basedir/repos and basedir/staging off of the repo root.
[12:20:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and I've launched with -r basedir/repos -s basedir/staging
[12:21:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, I need to populate basedir/repos/jquery-mobile with a bare repo, right?
[12:21:25] <gseguin> you need to check out a bare repo in basedir/repos/jquery
[12:21:32] <gseguin> yeah
[12:21:42] <gseguin> basedir/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile.git
[12:21:47] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[12:21:54] <_|Nix|_> Reproduce part of the GH structure.
[12:22:05] <_|Nix|_> That wasn't clear.
[12:22:13] <gseguin> then checkout the branch you want in basedir/staging/jquery/<your-branch>/jquery-mobile
[12:24:16] <_|Nix|_> Nooooo! I deleted my jqm repo!
[12:24:22] <_|Nix|_> *sigh*.
[12:24:36] <_|Nix|_> No big loss. I don't think I had much local stuff.
[12:24:44] <_|Nix|_> Still annoying to have to re-clone.
[12:29:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: How do I check out a branch from a bare repo?
[12:30:16] <gseguin> actually just creating the directory in staging should be enough
[12:30:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: just create basedir/staging/jquery/<your-branch>/jquery-mobile
[12:31:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, cool! That, I can do.
[12:31:26] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: then curl http://localhost:3000/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/<your-branch>

[12:36:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: In staging, is it really /jquery/<branch>/jquery-mobile and not /jquery/jquery-mobile/<branch>?
[12:36:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm getting a 404 for my branch.
[12:36:41] <gseguin> yes
[12:37:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: then curl http://localhost:3000/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile
[12:37:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: then curl http://localhost:3000/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/<branch>

[12:39:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I have this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/71719144e0b1a51fb299 and still just a spinner.
[12:39:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and GET //v1/dependencies/jquery/jquery-mobile/7360-table-review/?baseUrl=js 404 - - 1 ms
[12:40:12] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I don't see /basedir/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile.git
[12:40:25] <gseguin> that's the manual step
[12:40:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. Sorry. I misunderstood. I thought you said staging was enough.
[12:41:00] <gseguin> sorry
[12:41:10] <_|Nix|_> Actually, it's there.
[12:41:21] <_|Nix|_> Oh, the listing was | grep -v '\.git'
[12:41:29] <_|Nix|_> That's why it missed it.
[12:41:39] <gseguin> oh ok
[12:42:19] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: cd staging/jquery/7360-table-review/jquery-mobile && rm -rf .
[12:43:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You mean rm -rf *? rm -rf . gives me rm: cannot remove directory: ‘.’
[12:43:55] <gseguin> yes
[12:43:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I could just cd ..; rm -rf jquery-mobile ; mkdir jquery-mobile
[12:44:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yes that too
[12:45:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: now curl http://localhost:3000/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/7360-table-review
[12:45:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hold on ... I'm re-cloning the repo :)
[12:45:53] <gseguin> ok
[12:46:00] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: --bare, right?
[12:46:15] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[12:48:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The result of curl: {}
[12:48:24] <gseguin> hmm
[12:48:30] <_|Nix|_> OK, now I'm getting 500, not 404.
[12:48:32] <gseguin> it should be OK
[12:48:45] <_|Nix|_> Permissions should be OK as well. It's running as me.
[12:50:34] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Now, the directory listing is real short: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/e98899e3c21298ae3f0e
[12:50:47] <_|Nix|_> Didn't grep out .git either.
[12:51:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I suppose I can node --debug --debug-brk things.
[12:51:40] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ok try: curl  http://localhost:3000/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile
[12:52:02] <_|Nix|_> Same result.
[12:52:11] <gseguin> shite
[12:52:17] <gseguin> did you restart the server ?
[12:52:27] <_|Nix|_> No, but I can.
[12:52:42] <gseguin> just in case
[12:53:16] <_|Nix|_> Gah ... same thing.
[12:54:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll start debugging.
[12:54:20] <gseguin> ok
[12:54:27] <gseguin> I'm sure you're really close
[13:00:18] <_|Nix|_> This is weird. I can'
[13:00:36] <_|Nix|_> t put a breakpoint in the callbacks for //v1/:owner/:repo/:ref ...
[13:00:47] <_|Nix|_> I've even tried with debugger;
[13:14:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think I'm going to upgrade my node or something. It doesn't even seem to be calling the callbacks provided for the various URLs.
[13:15:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Like, I made this modification:
[13:15:04] <_|Nix|_> app.get( '/v1/:owner/:repo/:ref', function( req, res ) { process.stdout.write( "ABC\n" );
[13:15:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Try webstorm for debugging node
[13:15:30] <_|Nix|_> ... and I'm not even getting ABC printed to the console.
