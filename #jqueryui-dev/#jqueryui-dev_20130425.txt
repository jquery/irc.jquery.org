[05:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Is it troll week or something?

[05:15:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: "But how does it affect datepicker??" o_O
[05:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> I want to reply "Who the fuck cares? It's invalid and now it's broken."
[05:15:55] <kborchers> right
[05:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> But instead I'm just not going to respond.
[05:18:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think my favorite part is how they are setting the id via attr() after initializing the datepicker too :D  it would work just fine if they didn't do that
[05:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, what would be the purpose of doing that?
[05:18:55] <kborchers> no idea
[05:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll kborchers jzaefferer anyone else: http://cl.ly/image/30293d2a3O3b
[05:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[05:25:02] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez I prefer that but the <note> tag was stripping <code> tags.
[05:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Yeah, I had to add some code to grunt-jquery-content to make it work.
[05:26:03] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: not sure what I'm looking at
[05:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Wording variation for a note on api.jqueryui.com
[05:26:55] <kswedberg> they both look accurate to me, but I prefer the bottom variation.
[05:26:55] <kborchers> i prefer the second one i think
[05:26:59] <tj_vantoll> Excellent.  While you're at it:
[05:26:59] <tj_vantoll> "This widget manipulates its element's value programmatically, therefore a native change event may not be fired when the element's value changes."
[05:26:59] <tj_vantoll> I wanted <code></code> around "change" in that one as well.
[05:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Ok, I'll add that too.
[05:34:41] <reqq> Greetings. Is there any plans to include the possibility of bigger icons in the future? Like 20x20 and 32x32 sets by using CSS classess ui-icon-32 instead of ui-icon. I don't think this is impossible and I recon it would be a welcomed addition for many. The  progress at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/26308090/ThemeRoller-icon-set seems to have grinded to a halt. 
[05:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> reqq: We're investigating how to move forward with icons.
[05:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> The state of icons on the web is a total mess.
[05:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody has a decent solution for this right now.
[05:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> And we're trying to avoid picking a crippled solution that will just need to be changed again in a year or two.
[05:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, we're investigating all possibilities to figure out what the landscape really looks like.
[05:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> For example: http://temp.nemikor.com/icon-test/ (WebKit only)
[05:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> View source and look at lines 40 and 41.
[05:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how far we can go with polyfills and fallbacks for this approach though.
[05:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> But at some point that will be valid HTML and a workable solution.
[05:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's not clear when "some point" is though :-/
[05:46:48] <reqq> scott_gonzalez: Icons are indeed a challenge, at one point I thought of using the icon font method, but it just seemed too complicated compared to using a stable framework like jqueryUI
[05:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's a bit complicated, plus it presents accessibility challenges, since you end up with a random character in your markup (usually through generated content).
[05:48:54] <reqq> Indeed.
[05:49:07] <reqq> Thanks for the info in any case! The page I linked to can be found high on Google when searching for this stuff, your answers could server a larger audience there instead of just myself, how about adding them as a comment?
[05:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> reqq: I'm going to be creating a GitHub repo to track all of this.
[05:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> And I'll link to it from the wiki page.
[05:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> This <ui-icon> test is brand new. I just created it a few days ago.

[06:19:50] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: in the menu code we apply ui_corner-all to the <a> tag in a menu item
[06:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:20:07] <petersendidit> it current doesn't have any other ui-menu classes applyed to it
[06:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> I never really liked the way that worked.
[06:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> Let's skip it for now, just add a comment on the PR.
[06:20:42] <petersendidit> Add a note in the code too?
[06:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[06:37:27] <petersendidit> any ideas on handling buttonsets rtl direction stuff
[06:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> Let me look.
[06:38:04] <petersendidit> add ui-buttonset-ltr and ui-buttonset-rtl? so the ui-corner-* classes can be on it?
[06:38:56] <petersendidit> and it removes ui-corner-all from button, which is aqward in this new setup
[06:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is awkward.
[06:40:47] <petersendidit> yup
[06:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> So the sane way to handle this (sane being never using .ui-corner-*) would be:
[06:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-button { border-radius: 5px; }
[06:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-buttonset .ui-button { border-radius: 0; }
[06:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-buttonset-rtl .ui-button:first { border-radius: ... }
[06:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> right?
[06:42:25] <petersendidit> yea
[06:42:29] <petersendidit> that seems more logical
[06:42:40] <petersendidit> and means that javascript isn't doing the logic for styling
[06:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the problem is that we don't want to put border-radius rules into button.css.
[06:43:16] <petersendidit> ;-)
[06:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> Because that's supposed to be purely functional.
[06:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> So this is a place where ui-corner would still be an issue.
[06:43:53] <petersendidit> yup
[06:44:14] <petersendidit> for now I can just add a comment to the code and to the pr and we can deal with it later
[06:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I just had a crazy thought.
[06:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't like it though.
[06:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> "add me -but -not -me"
[06:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> Let's not even think about that right now.
[06:48:06] <tj_vantoll> I do think we need some better API for adding classes than what we have right now if we're going to eventually remove dialogClass, tooltipClass, etc...
[06:49:54] <petersendidit> The _classes change should replace both of those
[06:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, assuming we can figure out how to get around these hurdles.
[06:52:23] <tj_vantoll> petersendidit Right, I'm just saying that this isn't very elegant:
[06:52:23] <tj_vantoll> $( "#dialog" ).dialog({
[06:52:23] <tj_vantoll>     classes: {
[06:52:23] <tj_vantoll>         "ui-dialog": "custom-class" + $.ui.dialog.prototype._classes( "ui-dialog" )
[06:52:24] <tj_vantoll>     }
[06:52:24] <tj_vantoll> });
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: But it'll be null to begin with.
[06:53:50] <tj_vantoll> What would?
[06:53:58] <petersendidit> In some cases it would but not all
[06:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> classes[ "ui-dialog" ]
[06:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: We removed the ui-widget* classes from the option.
[06:54:30] <petersendidit> right now ui-dialog has ui-corner-all
[06:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right...
[06:55:16] <tj_vantoll> And you wouldn't want to remove "ui-dialog" probably either.  The use case of dialogClass is just adding a class.
[06:55:57] <tj_vantoll> And I think that's a far more common thing people would want to do than customizing the classes the framework uses.
[06:56:07] <tj_vantoll> So ideally we wouldn't make that harder.
[06:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's already pretty easy without the option.
[06:56:33] <tj_vantoll> True
[06:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> elem.dialog().dialog( "widget" ).addClass( ... )
[06:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming you just want this on a single instance.
[06:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> If you're doing this for all instances, the classes option is easy to use.
[06:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Because you do it once.
[06:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> So even if you had to change it over time for new releases, it's not hard.
[06:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> You can even write the long form and it'd be short
[06:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just change ThemeRoller to inject the corner classes on the appriorate selectors.
[06:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> And stop using ui-corner in our widgets.
[06:59:34] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I agree.  I still think it would be nice to have some syntax sugar to make adding an additional class to the existing list easier.  But I don't have any good ideas on how to do that though :)
[06:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, I really butchered that word.
[07:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's a good thing I don't talk as poorly as I type.
[07:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with not having a preprocessor is that no 3rd party widgets can inline border-radius.
[07:54:33] <petersendidit> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/790
[07:54:40] <petersendidit> should have all the widgets using _classes now
