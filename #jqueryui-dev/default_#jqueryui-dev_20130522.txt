[05:42:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you use jqueryui.com build-demos task? Does it work for you?
[05:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> It runs on every deploy.
[05:44:25] <rxaviers> Hm. Im double checking that nothing breaks after my PR, and Im checking that. But, it fails before and after to me.. perhaps my node version. will check
[05:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test it now.
[05:46:51] <rxaviers> here it "TypeError: Arguments to path.join must be strings"
[05:47:22] <rxaviers> it tries to join a string with an undefined...
[05:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> It worked fine.
[05:48:07] <rxaviers> what's your node version and commit hash plz
[05:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com (master) $ node -v
[05:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> v0.8.23
[05:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com (master) $ git log -1
[05:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> commit db94cec8baec9bfdf536a973901cd4b7c79eb071
[05:48:44] <rxaviers> thks!
[05:55:00] <rxaviers> interesting.. on node 0.8.23 it works just fine
[05:55:31] <rxaviers> on node v0.10.5, it fails.. I will check 0.9 too and file an issue so we remember to update the code, before hitting that issue live
[05:55:42] <rxaviers> whenever we update node live
[06:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there a still a few places where we fail on 0.10.
[06:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> I had switched for a while to fix some. I'll have to get back to doing that.
[06:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> At least this can only happen one more time :-)
[06:38:01] <rxaviers> db also fails running server on >= 0.9.. snif
[06:38:37] <rxaviers> so, it will also need a revision/fix for that
[06:39:50] <rxaviers> the cutoff is taking too long. Im getting crazy. Im feeling urgent to get that done and landed soon, so we can move on
[08:20:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers scott_gonzalez: I think its grunt 0.4.0 that fails on node 0.10.x; 0.4.1 works fine
[08:21:05] <jzaefferer> might also affect older grunt versions
[08:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, 0.3.x will fail, which is what we use for all site repos.
[08:22:14] <jzaefferer> actually 0.3.17 works fine for me with node 0.10.5
[08:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[08:28:34] <rxaviers> interesting
[09:28:47] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, about the __proto__ talk, as soon as I push this PR I am ready to talk about it ok. Will let you know.
[09:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ok
[09:29:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so my simulate "issues" ...
[09:29:46] <kborchers> simulating mousedown works but due to chorded buttons in pointerevents, i am not getting proper button/buttons values in my generated event
[09:30:28] <kborchers> so it breaks a number of things depending on those values in the generation of the pointerdown event
[09:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Is the problem that simulate isn't setting anything or is it setting the wrong thing?
[09:31:57] <kborchers> setting "wrong" thing … it's the correct thing now but wrong in terms of chorded buttons … well and it's not setting buttons at all, only button
[09:32:46] <DaveStein> scott_gonzalez: Crap i missed meeting... 
[09:32:52] <jzaefferer> crap, the one day where I'm actually at home at meeting time and I missed it again :/
[09:33:06] <DaveStein> lol im literally working from home
[09:33:07] <kborchers> double fail :D
[09:33:07] <jzaefferer> hey DaveStein, high five? /o\
[09:33:14] <DaveStein> jzaefferer of course
[09:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: So is simulate producing something different than what an old browser produces natively?
[09:33:56] <DaveStein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov any ETA on those pulls I made?
[09:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm confused by "it's the correct thing now but wrong in terms of chorded buttons"
[09:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> DaveStein: mikesherov said he has time set aside next week for PRs.
[09:35:08] <DaveStein> okay awesome
[09:35:41] <DaveStein> jzaefferer: You know I go nuts sine qunit is result, expected rather than the other way ;) I found some tests where people had it in reverse by mistake too... like jasmine
[09:35:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I think Felix was looking for some more feedback from you on selectmenu. Or is that covered?
[09:36:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm retracing my steps … just a min
[09:36:50] <jzaefferer> DaveStein: I'm sure you can figure it out eventually ;)
[09:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I have two comments from him in my inbox that I need to respond to.
[09:37:22] <DaveStein> jzaefferer haha yeah its not hard for me... only when a test is failing and its in the wrong order... ive been fixing up the tests 
[09:37:29] <DaveStein> like a test i didnt write :P
[09:37:51] <jzaefferer> yeah, been there. 
[09:38:00] <jzaefferer> I blame John Resig, he wrote the original assertions ;)
[09:38:03] <DaveStein> haha
[09:42:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, well it looks like it may just be an issue with my pointer code so i'll have to dig in more later
[09:42:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: one other thing
[09:43:23] <kborchers> thoughts on adding touch simulation? otherwise not sure how i will unit test that
[09:43:58] <kborchers> right now i'm just doing mouse events but eventually i assume we'll want all of the same tests for touch events
[09:43:59] <DaveStein> im out for now 
[09:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to. I want to just get real events with web driver.
[09:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> We already have a ton of flaky tests because of fake mouse events.
[09:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> I can only assume it would be worse with touch.
[09:45:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, so the question is should i spend anymore time on qunit and simulating mouse events?
[09:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not. Let's wait for DaveMethvin to get back and we can figure out what we're going to use.
[09:48:32] <kborchers> ok sounds good … i would like to get this sorted so i can start writing lots of tests because it's really hard to work on the pointerleave/enter stuff without something to test with so decided i should move my focus to writing tests. as soon as we decide where we're going with tests, i'll just dive in and start writing a bunch
[10:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: a88d64514001867b908776e6bfcfac7f1011970d caused a regression in Firefox
[10:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315
[10:17:15] <mikesherov> that's weird, I specifically tested in firefox...
[10:18:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I guess back it out for now?
[10:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see if I can figure out what's going on.
[10:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I'll revert that commit.
[10:56:24] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov scott_gonzalez That commit did fix the test case for #6258 in Firefox. It looks like that test case didn't cover everything though.
[10:56:24] <tj_vantoll> Also worth noting that it's not just a Firefox problem. I could recreate the issue in Opera and the OP said they could in IE as well.

[12:08:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js  is working fine for me too... 
[12:08:29] <agcolom> I think there was an issue recently but can't remember who was involved in the tracking... 
[12:17:31] <agcolom> I think last time gnarf asked the person having the issue to run a traceroute to find out where the problem was... 
[12:21:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think it could be related to https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/47
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Well, they're all going to be one of two problems.
[12:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> Either (mt) has blacklisted the IP or there's a problem between us and them.
[12:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> We can't actually do anything about either of them.
[12:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> If they're blacklisted, (mt) will usually remove them from the list if we ask.
[12:26:47] <agcolom> right... 
[12:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> But if they do that and the IP gets blacklisted again, it's a permanent ban.
[12:27:09] <agcolom> I think this is exactly what Corey said last time...
[12:27:35] <agcolom> Is it because their IP was used for some attack on the server?
[12:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> If they're blacklisted, yes.
[12:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> But that doesn't mean that it was them, since IPs can change.
[12:42:28] <agcolom> oh right! 
[12:42:41] <agcolom> Must be frustrating for them!
