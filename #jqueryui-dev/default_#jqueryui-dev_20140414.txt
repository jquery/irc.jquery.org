[03:25:23] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: sure
[03:25:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Awesome! Thanks a lot!
[03:26:20] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I'm on 7.0.6 Do I need to upgrade first?
[03:28:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Shouldn't matter.
[03:29:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The bug happens on iOS >= 7.0.3
[03:30:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There are encouraging signs that the fix is working (if it can be called a fix), but results from multipe iOS7 devices should provide reinforcement.
[03:32:23] <agcolom> very strange... When I add it to home screen, I launch the page, I just get a blank page!

[03:35:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That is weird.
[03:36:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I've been getting similar results, but then it just magically fixed itself?
[03:36:32] <agcolom> yes! And the strange thing is that the button is on the icon... 
[03:37:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://jsbin.com/omixiliJ/8 has code from master === broken. Can you get that running on the home screen?
[03:37:38] * agcolom trying now...
[03:38:08] <_|Nix|_> Of course, it doesn't help that I can't get a console on any of this just to check for JS errors :/
[03:38:29] <_|Nix|_> Anyhoo, I'm up for a doctor's appointment ... BBIAB
[03:39:38] <agcolom> same with 8... 
[03:57:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Thanks for looking!
[03:57:37] <agcolom> so 7 works 8 is on and off
[03:57:54] <agcolom> you're welcome :-)
[04:02:54] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Wait a sec: In 7, the popup does not close when you focus on one of the inputs inside? If so, that's great news!
[04:03:08] <agcolom> yep :-)
[04:03:47] <agcolom> so it looks like you managed to fix this :-)
[04:41:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Cool! Thanks again for looking :)
[05:18:13] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... I'm an idiot. I fixed it by introducing a JS error. Brilliant :)
[05:18:33] <_|Nix|_> Now, I need to find out what events are happening before the resize that is causing the popup to close.
[05:19:27] <_|Nix|_> It's weird. I'm not getting a vmousedown on the text input before the resize and focus in.
[05:20:08] <_|Nix|_> I can handle it reactively, and not close the popup if I get a vclick on the screen and the popup is hidden.
[05:28:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so what exactly is the issue?
[05:29:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the WebView, the popup receives a resize event before the focusin on the input, so the resize event causes the popup to be momentarily hidden and then moved to the centre of the window and then shown.
[05:29:56] <arschmitz> ok
[05:30:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, when this happens, for some reason, a subsequent vclick is generated and received by the popup's screen, causing the popup to close.
[05:31:07] <tj_vantoll> Anybody know where http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css is generated?
[05:32:24] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: Do you know what builds http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css?
[05:33:21] <rxaviers> hello tj_vantoll, 
[05:33:34] <rxaviers> where's the file from?
[05:33:41] <rxaviers> s/the/that
[05:35:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suspect that the reason the vclick ends up happening on the popup's screen is that, when the focusin on the popup's child input happens, the popup is hidden because of the ongoing repositioning to the centre of the window.
[05:35:42] <arschmitz> sounds about right
[05:35:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In Safari, the focus event is received before the resize event, so there's no problem.
[05:37:10] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: It's generated each day with the latest code from master.
[05:37:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, in Safari you don't even get a resize event at all.
[05:37:31] <tj_vantoll> It's the first link here: http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[05:39:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another angle is trying to distinguish the resize preceeding the focusin from other, genuine resize events. That seems rather difficult.
[05:40:04] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: just found something you might find interesting
[05:40:10] <tj_vantoll> Anyways http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css is missing two files and I have no idea where to report it to.
[05:40:21] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: What's that?
[05:40:40] <arschmitz> im sure you have heard before about webviews being gimped in terms of js performance
[05:40:48] <tj_vantoll> yep
[05:40:54] <arschmitz> there was a lot of talk about it for a long time 
[05:41:00] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: not true in ios 7
[05:41:11] <arschmitz> its actually quite a bit faster in ios7
[05:41:25] <arschmitz> at least on iphone 5s
[05:41:28] <tj_vantoll> wow
[05:41:44] <arschmitz> i just tested it out of curiosity to see if it was still true
[05:42:04] <tj_vantoll> In theory that would make JS faster on Chrome for Android compared to iOS Safari?
[05:42:24] <arschmitz> well in chrome for ios you mean?
[05:42:37] <tj_vantoll> err yeah, whoops
[05:42:55] <arschmitz> tell you in a few seconds
[05:44:21] <tj_vantoll> I don't know if I've seen any good research into that post-iOS7.
[05:44:43] <arschmitz> yeah i had not seen anything recent which is why i was checking
[05:45:13] <tj_vantoll> "For example, Mobile Safari benefits from a JavaScript engine that is 3X faster than UIWebView." April 2013 (http://www.guypo.com/mobile/ios-browsers-speed-bakeoff/)
[05:45:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Any idea how I might tell what kinds of event occur between the user pressing their finger on the textinput and the focusin event? I've tryed vmousemove and even touchstart, and I'm getting no hits :(
[05:45:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/bupak/1/edit
[05:46:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: hmm so i was using sunspider
[05:46:34] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: and it wont run it seems in ios chrome
[05:46:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, lessee ... thanks!
[05:46:54] <tj_vantoll> hmmm
[05:48:16] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: http://iao.fi/myposts/uiwebview
[05:48:59] <tj_vantoll> "What we can see is that Mobile Safari performance has improved slightly and that UIWebView is still about five times slower than Safari. In fact, the UIWebView performance has somewhat regressed. This means that Nitro JIT JavaScript engine is still definitely not enabled in UIWebView."
[05:49:36] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: interesting there is a hardware difference though im on a 5s which has the 64bit processing
[05:49:58] <arschmitz> so my ios7 mobile safari is only 450
[05:50:15] <arschmitz> and in a webview i get like 355 consistently 
[05:50:23] <rxaviers> gnarf, hello Corey. Do you know  what builds http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css (as tj_vantoll asks above)? I'd guess that a process uses DB. But, Im not sure which process does so...
[05:51:12] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: That's odd. I would expect the 5s to be faster, but I wouldn't expect anything that drastic.
[05:51:38] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: it lines up exactly with what apple claimed at release
[05:52:10] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: gotta remember they are on an ipad 2 
[05:52:15] <arschmitz> much slower then a 5s
[05:52:23] <arschmitz> and 5s was double the speed of 5
[05:52:45] <tj_vantoll> True. I would expect the speeds to be way faster, but the difference to still be there.
[05:52:54] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:53:09] <tj_vantoll> Because that part is baked into the software.
[05:53:18] <arschmitz> maybe something changed in one of the 7.x updates
[05:54:56] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: or maybe a homescreen app and a webview are not the same any more
[05:55:26] <arschmitz> i was testing in a homescreen app in the past they were essentially the same thing
[05:59:27] <_|Nix|_> Holy shitsu! I'm getting touchstart events in Chrome/desktop!
[06:00:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you have touch events turned on in inspector?
[06:01:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I dunno ... I might ...
[06:01:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I never turned them on, IIRC ...
[06:02:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well im not seeing them
[06:02:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can't even find the setting to turn them on.
[06:02:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also weird that I'm not getting vmouse events.
[06:05:57] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Sorry. I'm having connectivity issues again.
[06:06:06] <tj_vantoll> That is odd.
[06:06:20] <arschmitz> thats ok and yeah it is odd im going to continue to look into it 
[06:06:25] <arschmitz> try it on some more devices
[06:06:55] <tj_vantoll> My mystery for the morning is why jQuery UI's interactions work on WP8 but not Chrome 35 for Android—which now has touch-action support.
[06:07:04] <arschmitz> see what i see different places i have a couple ipad 2's i just need to charge up so i can try and exactly replicate their tests
[06:07:16] <arschmitz> hmmm
[06:07:40] <arschmitz> yeah iv tried them on wp8 before using touch action and it was always perfect
[06:08:32] <arschmitz> i have not tried 35 for android yet though its on my todo list today
[06:10:21] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm at a loss.
[06:10:54] <tj_vantoll> I should verify the implementation is actually there I guess.
[06:11:00] <arschmitz> ill let you know if i find anything
[06:11:10] <tj_vantoll> Thanks.
[06:21:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, the solution: Listen for vmousedown and, if a vmousedown happens while the popup is open and hits an element contained inside the popup, then ignore resize events for the following 1000ms :/
[06:21:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Fscking jittery iOS ... it'll resize at the drop of a hat :/
[06:31:22] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer kborchers: Any idea what generates http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css?
[06:34:26] <kborchers> tj_vantoll: i'm not quite sure. rxaviers may know
[06:35:18] <tj_vantoll> Thanks. I already asked him :)
[06:35:27] <kborchers> heh, ok
[06:36:09] <rxaviers> Unfortunately, Im not sure either. I bet something uses DB... I've put gnarf on the loop. :)
