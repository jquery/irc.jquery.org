[05:36:06] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez #9242, #9243, & #9244 should really be hard deleted but I don't know how to do that.  I might not have rights.
[05:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: I think you meant that message for #jquery-dev. UI sends the filenames you expect.
[05:40:37] <bot-t> (28 hours 30 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell scott_gonzalez When I attempt to run grunt deploy for api.jquerymobile.com I get "Error: Mismatching versions. grunt-wordpress: 1.0.7; XML-RPC version: 1.0.5"
[05:40:37] <bot-t> (28 hours 30 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell scott_gonzalez How do I ensure that I have the latest "XML-RPC"? I've already installed the latest available xmlrpc packages for my Linux distro.
[05:40:37] <bot-t> (28 hours 20 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell scott_gonzalez Sure enough, if, in package.json I lower the version to grunt-wordpress 1.0.5, it works just fine. It uploads to wordpress without error.
[05:40:37] <bot-t> (28 hours 1 min ago) <_|Nix|_> tell scott_gonzalez I even tried to install the latest and greatest libxmlrpc (01.34.00) from sources and I still get that error.
[05:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: You're so slow...
[05:40:53] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Is that a question?
[05:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: No, it's a fact.

[05:42:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i sent DaveMethvin|away an image last night but here is an update … his pointerdown tests running with my special event impl, in Chrome :) http://cl.ly/image/2f2l2P2Y3m1H
[05:42:56] <kborchers> only two tests that fail are tests that check if it's an instanceof PointerEvent which obviously it's not
[05:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's awesome.
[05:44:26] <kborchers> i plan on forking his repo and getting all of the tests (that are currently written) working with the special events then we can go from there
[05:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: The delete option is super hidden.
[05:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> In the description, there's a link for reply and delete.
[05:51:04] <scott_gonzalez> Top right of the description area.
[05:51:26] <tj_vantoll> Oh wow.  In the description, OF COURSE :)
[05:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oops, deleted the one with your comment.
[05:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> I copied your comment over to the first one.
[05:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> aw crap.
[05:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> And you deleted the first one :-P
[05:52:50] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I started at the first one :)
[05:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> hahaha
[05:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh well
[05:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> He can post for the tenth time if he needs to :-P
[05:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't a bug anyway...
[05:53:46] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, nothing we can do, oh well.
[06:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'm adding a <p> around the note and landing it.
[06:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0q242J2E0m0c
[06:26:55] <tj_vantoll> Cool.
[06:29:40] <tj_vantoll> More feedback: We should probably have this documented on dialog's API page: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#added-ability-to-specify-which-element-to-focus-on-open.  Thinking about adding a section to talk about the various focus things that dialog does.
[06:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[06:39:38] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #38 by tjvantoll (1d 10h ago): Add a note about the ui object passed to events when it contains no properties
[06:41:11] <tj_vantoll> True.
[06:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: BTW, the widget factory forces this to happen.
[06:44:45] <tj_vantoll> The object argument itself.  My concern was more that I could see UI / mobile / whatever wanting to name it something other than "ui" in the docs.
[06:46:06] <tj_vantoll> I guess we could've said get the 2nd argument rather than relying on name="ui", but this is very unlikely to break.
[06:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if Mobile ever decides to change the name, we can update the XSL.

[06:50:19] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #120 by scottgonzalez (1m 18s ago): Dialog: Document focus logic
[06:51:27] <tj_vantoll> Cool.  I should be able to tackle that sometime this week.
[07:36:04] <_zoggy_> Facebook has begun using a Google image format called WebP that could lower its network costs and speed up its Web site. But the move has angered some members. When people upload JPEG photos, the social-networking juggernaut converts them into the WebP format. And now it also apparently has begun delivering those images to people with browsers that can handle them, which today means Chrome 
[07:36:05] <_zoggy_> and Opera.
[08:09:01] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: yes, my bad ;)
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> haha: http://twitter.com/SoupBowlWeb/status/326727941839015937
[09:13:43] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @SoupBowlWeb: Didn't realize how many great customization options are now in jQuery Datepicker http://t.co/R2o1gbrG4N
[09:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, "now"
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> You know, cuz we'd been adding options left and right to datepicker :-P
[09:18:08] <kborchers> :D
[09:45:30] <blittle> Does anyone know if this bug is still in one way or another an issue?
[09:45:30] <blittle> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8996
[09:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> blittle: What do you mean? There was no bug to begin with.
[09:48:17] <blittle> Look at this fiddle
[09:48:24] <blittle> it works with jquery 1.9
[09:48:25] <blittle> http://jsfiddle.net/HTa6D/2/
[09:48:29] <blittle> but not with 2.0
[09:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think you mean not with 1.10
[09:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> Stop using uiAutocomplete.
[09:49:08] <blittle> yes
[09:49:13] <scott_gonzalez> ui-autocomplete
[09:49:34] <blittle> it says that they should be the same in the eyes of .data()
[09:49:39] <blittle> I guess not?
[09:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> That may be a bug in core.
[09:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> But you shouldn't use uiAutocomplete either way.
[09:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> Whether it works or not, it's not correct.
[09:50:36] <blittle> I am using a 3rd party library
[09:50:44] <blittle> Document Cloud's visualsearch
[09:50:49] <blittle> they use uiAutocomplete
[09:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> You should go yell at them :-)
[09:50:56] <blittle> I'll do a pull request
[09:51:11] <blittle> What is the reasoning for supporting both?
[09:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if they're using UI > 1.8, they shouldn't even be accessing it like that.
[09:51:28] <blittle> uiAutocomplete for < 1.8?
[09:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Never use uiAutocomplete.
[09:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's never correct.
[09:51:47] <blittle> k
[09:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> Regardless of whether it works with certain versions of core.
[09:52:14] <blittle> Ok, thanks
[09:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> Starting with UI 1.9, you can create extensions in a sane way.
[09:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> And avoid going down to the instance like that.
[09:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> But that really depends on whether you're creating a new plugin or a one-off.
[09:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> But since this is a 3rd party script, it should fall into the plugin category.
[09:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, just tell them to use the hyphenated version.
[09:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> Since that's the real name that jQuery UI uses.
[09:55:17] <blittle> Thank you
[10:59:44] <benth> anyone know if there's any movement on this bug? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8044
[11:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:02:06] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: with the ._classes stuff. should I deprecate dialogClass in the process?
[11:02:20] <petersendidit> or just remove it
[11:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> Deprecate, but it should be in its own commit.
[11:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, it doesn't need its own commit.
[11:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> As long as dialog is done by itself.
[11:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> We'll add the ticket afterward and just edit the commit message before merging.
[11:03:55] <petersendidit> ok
[11:04:03] <petersendidit> planning to do each widget as a commit
[11:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good

[11:33:00] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Added CONTRIBUTING.md.
[11:53:21] <petersendidit> should I create a dialog_deprecated.js and dialog_deprecated.html to move the tests in to?
[11:58:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Thx for the comntributing.md :-)
[11:59:07] <agcolom> contributing^ 
[11:59:24] <agcolom> I'd like ot check something with you if you are around...
[11:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: yup
[12:00:32] <agcolom> ok, on the page... https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md 
[12:01:14] <agcolom> there is something which can be taken in two ways, so just wanted to check it was correct.
[12:01:58] <agcolom> "You'll definitely want to take a look at the articles on contributing documentation."
[12:02:32] <agcolom> should it be "You'll definitely want to take a look at the articles on contributing to documentation." ?
[12:02:56] <agcolom> (I guess both are correct but mean something slightly different...
[12:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> They are contributing documentation.
[12:03:21] <agcolom> ok. fine then
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to contributing code.
[12:03:24] <agcolom> Thanks
[12:03:52] <agcolom> yes, I get it now... 
[12:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:04:36] <agcolom> English can be a funny language ;-)
[12:06:38] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re "instructions on how to maintain your fork and submit your code. "
[12:07:36] <agcolom> should we make this "instructions on how to maintain your fork and submit your contribution" or are we happy with "code"? (I guess code is used everywhere else) 
[12:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have a strong opinion either way.
[12:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub refers to all repositories as code.
[12:08:13] <agcolom> Same here...
[12:08:28] <agcolom> ok, fine to keep code then.
[12:08:32] <agcolom> Thanks
[12:09:08] <agcolom> (just wanted to be sure these things got discussed :) )
[12:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: https://github.com/jquery/foundation/issues/197
[12:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> I asked ajpiano to write the template this morning.
[12:12:31] <agcolom> Brilliant! 
[12:12:47] <agcolom> This is an excellent idea! 
[13:14:13] <petersendidit> Are we wanting to switch to the _classes for all widgets? autocompete seems like one where we might not "have" to
[13:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, for all of them.
[14:59:15] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov hey guy... im actually actually gonna fix draggable some now for those fialing tests and tomorrow as well... so i take it all these fails are from adding new unit tests frmo master and removing that master_tests branch?
[15:06:44] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov : What's the proper way to know if something is a jquery object? looks like the containment logic is using $.isArray but that isn't right
[15:06:55] <Dave_Stein> i bet that's a RTFM answer ha
[15:08:31] <Dave_Stein> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1853223/check-if-object-is-a-jquery-object
[15:08:47] <Dave_Stein> the more you know... while talking to yourself
[15:12:15] <Dave_Stein> okay apparently i lost privelages so i can't push this fix....
[15:12:47] <gnarf> push to your fork and PR?
[15:12:55] <Dave_Stein> i haven't had to use a fork in ages
[15:13:02] <Dave_Stein> i don't even have a fork anymore
[15:13:17] <Dave_Stein> and my fix is literally adding a "!" haha
[15:15:01] <Dave_Stein> maybe someone who has admin access didnt know me when they reviewed access
[15:35:13] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: How good are you with the test suite in UI?
[15:35:34] <Dave_Stein> i see a bunch of tests failing if the suite runs, but not if i rerun it by itself which would make me think one test is impacting the other but i dont see how
[17:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell Dave_Stein I removed your push access so that you would start sending PRs.
[17:53:14] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell Dave_Stein about that.
[17:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell Dave_Stein the way to check for a jQuery object is obj.jquery
[17:54:05] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell Dave_Stein about that.
