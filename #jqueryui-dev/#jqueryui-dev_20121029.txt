[07:46:43] <gnarf> kborchers: send me your pubkey?
[07:49:32] <kborchers> gnarf: e-mailed
[07:51:36] <mikesherov> .
[07:51:44] <mikesherov> old habits die hard
[07:51:57] <mikesherov> I can't stop doing my stupid "." to see if I have messages
[07:52:24] <kborchers> ?tell mikesherov here you go :P
[07:52:24] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[07:52:40] <mikesherov> But I never have messages
[07:52:41] <bot-t> (16 secs ago) <kborchers> tell mikesherov here you go :P
[07:52:53] <mikesherov> because I'm always online
[07:53:05] <mikesherov> wait, I thought bot-t tells me immediately
[07:53:31] <kborchers> nope, only once you say something as far as i know
[07:53:48] <mikesherov> 143 "new" bugs left!
[07:54:15] <mikesherov> sortable! grrrr
[08:04:28] <gnarf> kborchers: just added your ssh key to kborchers@blog.jqueryui.com
[08:05:04] <kborchers> gnarf: thanks
[08:05:07] <gnarf> kborchers: /var/www/stage.blog.jqueryui.com -- you should find the DB credentials somewhere inside there
[08:05:15] <kborchers> ok, cool
[10:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov tj_vantoll: ticketgraph is looking good :-)
[10:45:04] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: :-)
[10:45:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I think we need to change our view on interaction rewrites
[10:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> How so?
[10:46:03] <mikesherov> we should not be ignoring tickets that come in for interactions
[10:46:19] <mikesherov> I mean, I'm sure you've been doing the right thing for the past year or so
[10:46:39] <mikesherov> maybe I'm just seeing a previous strategy that is no longer applicable because I'm going through old tixx
[10:47:10] <mikesherov> but a lot of the tickets basically tell the OP that they're not going to get looked at because they're being rewritten
[10:47:19] <mikesherov> and those comments are like 20 months old
[10:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> The message there is supposed to be "This is low priority for us right now,"
[10:48:04] <mikesherov> sure
[10:48:12] <mikesherov> I get it
[10:48:21] <mikesherov> and you're taking it block by block
[10:48:25] <mikesherov> one component at a time
[10:48:28] <mikesherov> which makes sense
[10:49:12] <mikesherov> but from an attraction standpoint to potential new contributors, I think we can do better and I'm committed to investigating all the bugs there
[10:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: If you want to do that, feel free.
[10:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> Just be aware that there's an extremely high regression rate with every bug fix in interactions.
[10:49:56] <mikesherov> I figured as much
[10:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we stopped.
[10:50:14] <mikesherov> I see
[10:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> It felt like at least half of the bug fixes resulted in regressions.
[10:50:38] <mikesherov> how much of that is from lack of a good unit test suite and having too many options to contend with?
[10:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's a combination of things.
[10:51:03] <scott_gonzalez> Lack of a good test suite.
[10:51:06] <scott_gonzalez> Conflicting options.
[10:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> Unknown use cases.
[10:51:19] <mikesherov> yeah
[10:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hard to understand existing code.
[10:51:41] <mikesherov> So, let me put it this way… I want to start making a dent here beyond just triage
[10:52:00] <mikesherov> and I always feel like attacking the most broken code is where I excel
[10:52:07] <mikesherov> so I have a plan in my mind
[10:52:23] <mikesherov> and I just want to convey it to you to maybe get your feedback if it's the right approach or not
[10:52:33] <mikesherov> 1. clean up bug tracker so everything is actionable
[10:52:45] <mikesherov> this is easy, and it's like 70% done
[10:53:22] <mikesherov> but even when that happens, no one will be able to take those tickets because of merge freeze due to rewrite
[10:53:42] <mikesherov> so 2. would be to clean up the test suite for interactions
[10:53:56] <mikesherov> but that requires knowing what we want the API to be
[10:54:12] <mikesherov> so really, 2. is decide on the API for the interactions
[10:54:25] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I don't know how to do that, though
[10:55:31] <mikesherov> 1. clean up bug tracker. 2. decide API for interactions. 3. clean up test suite...
[10:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, even with the API redesign, you can't really write the test suite against the current code because there will be differences.
[10:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, you can test the common parts.
[10:56:25] <mikesherov> right
[10:56:29] <mikesherov> yes
[10:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't know how far that will get you.
[10:56:48] <mikesherov> I think pretty far
[10:57:00] <mikesherov> the goal being accessible for contribution
[10:57:05] <mikesherov> not being done
[10:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XFeB_WSh-bynToPwWy9_JHsMHNFxaPYKv20p_sm2Eg/edit
[10:57:35] <mikesherov> OK
[10:57:37] <mikesherov> cool
[10:57:58] <mikesherov> right, so what does it mean that the test suite is cleaned up?
[10:58:22] <mikesherov> It means that the suite passes for all the functionality we want to keep, and that bad practices are removed
[10:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:58:35] <mikesherov> so that new contributions can be asked to come with tests
[10:58:44] <mikesherov> so then, once the test suite is cleaned up, pull requests should always come with tests. I can then start cleaning up the pull request queue by asking the existing pulls to have tests
[10:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Are you able to do a quick call?
[10:59:04] <mikesherov> sure
[10:59:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: loop me in too
[10:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:59:15] <kborchers> mikesherov: would you mind sending me some stats on all of the triage/other bug work you've been doing recently for UI, if you have it? specifically, numbers other than just the graphs which i am already going to show. i want to give you a shout out in my UI talk at jqcon asia
[10:59:28] <mikesherov> cool
[10:59:40] <mikesherov> kborchers: can you email me
[10:59:43] <mikesherov> mike.sherov@gmail.com
[10:59:56] <kborchers> mikesherov: yep, will do that now. thanks
[10:59:57] <mikesherov> so I can remember to do that for you with a bit more info on what you're looking for?
[11:00:04] <mikesherov> gnarf: skype me in?
[11:00:36] <gnarf> i think scott_gonzalez was doin that?
[11:00:40] <mikesherov> k
[11:00:45] <gnarf> if you don't have mike, i can start the call scott
[11:18:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this merge went kind of sideways on me, but I'm pretty sure that as far as jquery.ui.draggable.js goes - interactions wins right?
[11:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Just landed the syntax highlighting fix. Is there anything else that you need fixed for the learn site besdies the drafts re-publishing problem?
[11:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup, interactions always wins for draggable, droppable.
[11:20:18] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: just saw that indeed, and nothing else comes to mind right now as urgent
[11:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll get that fixed in grunt-wordpress, but jzaefferer and I think it makes more sense to move unfinished articles out of master.
[11:22:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: aren't you on vacation this week? :P
[11:23:44] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that kind of leads to low discoverability for things that aren't done yet, or need cleaning up
[11:23:56] <ajpiano> might make more sense to adopt that policy after we do the soft launch
[11:24:18] <ajpiano> so that master and order.yml are in sync at that point
[11:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if the goal is to have all of those published at launch, then they should just be unmarked as drafts and you should file issues.
[11:27:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm, there is something way sideways in this merge it seems... :/
[11:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Feel free to abandon it and I can look into it later.
[11:34:31] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: there are issues, not following what you mean by 'unmarked as drafts'
[11:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I'm saying you shouldn't have any drafts.
[11:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> Everything should be published.
[11:35:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/884c020 looks crazy, but I think it's okay
[11:35:06] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i am trying to think of an easy way for people to work on things that aren't "done" yet but have discoverability for edits
[11:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming the plan is to include all the articles when we launch.
[11:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> Put them in a branch and create an issue for ti.
[11:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> Issues are the road to discovery, not source browsing.
[11:36:18] <ajpiano> fair enough
[11:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That's really hard to review :-/
[11:37:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah i know :(
[11:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose I should just look at the diffs of the conflicted files.
[11:37:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i did some manual merging
[11:37:44] <gnarf> copyright/api links on the headers
[11:37:50] <gnarf> and the demos
[11:38:36] <gnarf> i made master win for demos, then renamed mouse -> interaction
[11:38:56] <gnarf> and i made interactions win for ui.draggable / ui.droppable and altered the headers
[11:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> This merge is bad.
[11:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/884c020#diff-65
[11:40:43] <gnarf> sigh
[11:40:45] <gnarf> demos
[11:40:48] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/jxay6Q
[11:40:48] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/master a688e7c Corey Frang: Mixed spaces and tabs removed
[11:40:52] <gnarf> should interactions win there too?
[11:40:57] * gnarf shrugs
[11:41:04] <gnarf> it was ugly man
[11:41:05] <gnarf> :)
[11:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Demos need manual conflict resolution.
[11:41:32] <gnarf> thats why i pushed it to my fork
[11:42:53] <gnarf> btw, that push on master fixes a lint issue
[11:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh shit, I should not have opened that merge 20 times in Chrome.
[11:44:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think i need to punt that merge over to your plate
[11:44:39] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA, I just closed all those tabs and reclaimed 2.7 GB of RAM.
[11:44:40] <gnarf> I got a little lost following it
[11:44:56] <gnarf> am i the only one with these lint issues on master?
[11:45:13] * scott_gonzalez checks
[11:45:19] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/7e0e22d227bfa24d0e9d
[11:45:24] <gnarf> oh wait
[11:45:42] <gnarf> sigh
[11:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> no errors here
[11:45:49] <gnarf> bitten by lack of npm install
[11:45:54] <gnarf> curse you npm
[11:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[11:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> So, how about that grunt plugin to check npm status? :-)
[11:47:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/isaacs/read-installed/issues/4
[11:47:24] <gnarf> it wouldn't of caught this one anyway
[11:47:30] <gnarf> cuz npm ls doesn't check devDependencies
[11:47:54] <gnarf> but after that
[11:48:38] <gnarf> you could do something as simple as check the exit code of npm ls and throw up early with it's errors
[12:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov tj_vantoll: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3628#comment:13
[12:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> I know this is broken.
[12:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> But I can't prove it :-(
[12:13:37] <mikesherov> Oh
[12:13:42] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that's why I left it open, but I also couldn't get it to happen.
[12:13:45] <mikesherov> I just looked at something similar
[12:14:01] <mikesherov> if it's both resizable and draggable I think is where it shows up
[12:14:21] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6939#comment:5
[12:14:43] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6939#comment:1
[12:14:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> Aha.
[12:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> That would explain it. The workaround I wrote was for a dialog that was both draggable and resizable.
[12:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, adding .draggable() to that fiddle makes it fail.
[12:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess that ticket should be closed as worksforme.
[12:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> And 6939 is the real bug.
[12:18:02] <tj_vantoll> Nice
[12:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> closed
[12:20:11] <Zeiss2020> Hi All. New to IRC. There is a flaw (misc pixels) in the animation gif for the progress bar.
[12:20:51] <Zeiss2020> I have corrected the gif and made some different colored ones. How do I 'donate' them to the jquery-ui?
[12:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020: Which image are you referring to?
[12:26:52] <Zeiss2020> The animated progress bar orange tones in the lower dark section you can see some odd pixels running across the animation
[12:27:10] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #750: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/750/
[12:27:10] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Mixed spaces and tabs removed
[12:27:32] <Zeiss2020> I only picked it up due to editing and blowing the gif up x10
[12:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020: Are you talking about the demo?
[12:28:27] <Zeiss2020> Yes and if you download custom ui it is included
[12:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> The way to share your fix is to send a pull request against https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[12:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> And you should sign the CLA: http://jquery.github.com/cla.html
[12:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: It seems strange asking for a CLA for this :-P
[12:31:44] <DaveMethvin> well that's why i asked a few weeks back about stuff like this ... sometimes it seems not worth the hassle when someone just edits a comment or whatever scott_gonzalez
[12:31:54] <DaveMethvin> but then if you put them in the AUTHORS.txt file for that ... ?
[12:32:03] <Zeiss2020> If you go to the demo and look at the 75% position from the top you will see pixels coming and going
[12:32:06] <DaveMethvin> and if you do then how do you ensure that they signed the CLA later?
[12:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, since we're liberal with AUTHORS.txt, we need to be strict with the CLA...
[12:34:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah, AUTHORS.txt is more like CONTRIBUTORS.txt in some ways
[12:34:42] <DaveMethvin> where some contributions are non-code
[12:35:17] <Zeiss2020> OK CLA Done
[12:35:51] <Zeiss2020> Github - Pull Requests?
[12:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020: Have you used GitHub before?
[12:37:17] <Zeiss2020> Nope
[12:38:32] <Zeiss2020> Just trying to figure out how to register
[12:39:10] <DaveMethvin> Zeiss2020: from the main github.com page its at the top, Signup and Pricing
[12:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> Click the big blue button on http://github.com :-)
[12:39:28] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/plans
[12:39:37] <DaveMethvin> Free, FREEEEEE!
[12:40:43] <Zeiss2020> OK logged in
[12:40:59] <Zeiss2020> How do I add a pull request?
[12:42:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: stop flooding my inbox! :P
[12:42:48] <DaveMethvin> Zeiss2020: it depends ... i can walk you through the long way if you think you'll be contributing more later
[12:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Come on, I'm nothing compared to mikesherov and tj_vantoll lately.
[12:43:22] <DaveMethvin> it takes some time to set up but once you have it set up it's much easier to do pull requests
[12:43:33] <mikesherov> LOL
[12:43:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: heh, i have a filter for trac to go to a folder … not for github notifications
[12:43:54] <Zeiss2020> Well there have been a few requests for different animations. I have a few different colors and an animated email.
[12:44:06] <DaveMethvin> for a one-off it's probably easier for scott_gonzalez to just take the image and commit it in  your name. :D
[12:44:15] <DaveMethvin> what do you say scott_gonzalez
[12:44:22] <DaveMethvin> and weren't you supposed to be on vacation?
[12:44:41] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: i asked that same question and he ignored me
[12:44:44] <kborchers> :)
[12:44:46] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:44:58] <DaveMethvin> if he's still in NC he's kind of trapped there
[12:45:03] <kborchers> yeah
[12:45:24] <Zeiss2020> Up the creek without a paddle so to say
[12:46:03] <DaveMethvin> so Zeiss2020 to get started once you're logged in, find the project you want to change
[12:46:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Oh, my responses to jzaefferer's PR?
[12:46:16] <Zeiss2020> Ok
[12:46:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: YES
[12:46:20] <kborchers> :)
[12:46:37] <DaveMethvin> so for example, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/
[12:46:39] <kborchers> every comment is a new e-mail
[12:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I missed your question :-P DaveMethvin: Yeah, I'm on vacation, but trying to get a few hours in here and there.
[12:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> My inbox is filling up, I don't like that :-P
[12:46:55] <DaveMethvin> blame mikesherov for that
[12:46:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: my favorite e-mail so far was "no idea"
[12:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm in Florida.
[12:46:58] <kborchers> :D
[12:47:05] <DaveMethvin> his internet can be out and he's still filling the inbox
[12:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> Gulf coast, avoiding the bad weather.
[12:47:34] <DaveMethvin> Zeiss2020: so there should be a "fork" button on the project
[12:47:35] <mikesherov> I'm trying
[12:47:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nice! i was just in orlando and it was absolutely beautiful the whole time we were ther
[12:47:41] <kborchers> there*
[12:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> "no idea" pretty much sums things up
[12:47:50] <Zeiss2020> Got it
[12:47:59] <DaveMethvin> click that and it will make a "copy" to your own account
[12:48:17] <DaveMethvin> that will be the one where you make changes, and then you make pull requests from that copy
[12:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020 DaveMethvin: I'm fine commiting with Zeiss2020 as the author if he doesn't want to go through the full process.
[12:48:50] <DaveMethvin> your call Zeiss2020, you will need to install some software on your computer and it will take some time
[12:49:01] <DaveMethvin> if it's mainly just images i'd take scott_gonzalez up on his offer :D
[12:49:17] <Zeiss2020> GitHub @ 80%
[12:49:25] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, ui is big
[12:49:33] <DaveMethvin> well it's not fat, just big boned
[12:49:47] <DaveMethvin> damn, really blowing here now
[12:49:50] <DaveMethvin> baltimore
[12:49:50] <Zeiss2020> phat maybe?
[12:50:45] <DaveMethvin> Zeiss2020: let me find some step by step help pages on github ... are you using a mac?
[12:51:06] <Zeiss2020> LOL - PC
[12:51:11] <DaveMethvin> windows?
[12:51:19] <Zeiss2020> Win 7
[12:51:26] <DaveMethvin> yay, two of us now!
[12:51:54] <DaveMethvin> for what you're doing, the native app might be good
[12:52:03] <DaveMethvin> i only played with it but it's a lot easier to set up
[12:52:04] <DaveMethvin> https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
[12:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 30 emails!
[12:54:10] <Zeiss2020> busy cloning 60%
[12:54:22] <DaveMethvin> hardcore forking action
[12:56:41] <Zeiss2020> OK cloned and all that
[12:56:55] <Zeiss2020> Just need to figure out where the graphics go.
[12:57:03] <Zeiss2020> Thanks for all the help
[12:57:50] <DaveMethvin> Zeiss2020, one of the most important rules is "always do your work on a branch"
[12:58:15] <Zeiss2020> Yip in a branch now
[12:58:29] <DaveMethvin> now find the graphic you want to edit
[12:58:42] <DaveMethvin> drop yours in the directory to replace it
[12:59:23] <Zeiss2020> I will drop it in tomorrow. I just want to make damn sure mine is 100%
[12:59:35] <DaveMethvin> sure, and there's lots of docs on github too
[12:59:57] <Zeiss2020> How do I add different colored ones?
[13:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020: We don't want different colors.
[13:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is just a one-off demo.
[13:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's not part of any themes.
[13:00:48] <Zeiss2020> OK But then how could I make them available for others to use?
[13:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Zeiss2020: umm... host them somewhere?
[13:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> They're just generic repeating images, right?
[13:01:46] <Zeiss2020> Mostly
[13:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> This image is not something we support.
[13:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, it will most likely go away when we redo our demos.

[13:03:37] <Zeiss2020> Ok will try and find some other way to share them then.
[13:03:47] <Zeiss2020> Thanks for the info and help
[13:06:01] <Zeiss2020> Are we allowed to post links here?

[13:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> I remember when I learned that.
[13:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> I had written a bunch of JS to test out an idea someone had, then a designer was like "Why'd you write all that code?" and deleted everything and added 4 lines of CSS.
