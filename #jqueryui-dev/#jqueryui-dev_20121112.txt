[05:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Some back story on stale PRs...
[05:30:38] <mikesherov> I love this back stories
[05:30:45] <mikesherov> it's like story time with scott_gonzalez
[05:30:51] <mikesherov> these*
[05:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> As jzaefferer mentioned, we obviously don't have the manpower to do everything right now.
[05:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> And 1.9 was taking forever.
[05:31:34] <mikesherov> gotta prioritize. I get it
[05:31:38] <mikesherov> so it was heads down time
[05:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> So long, in fact, that jzaefferer got mad and made me cut scope.
[05:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so I was heads down on specific plugins, literally for years.
[05:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> And that trend will continue until we get out of this hole.
[05:32:20] <mikesherov> block by block
[05:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which, luckily you and TJ and doing a great job of helping with :-)
[05:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> So every once in a while, we would actually go through the PR queue.
[05:32:45] <mikesherov> sure, I think that makes sense for a team that doesn't have me and TJ on it
[05:32:55] <mikesherov> right
[05:33:07] <mikesherov> I think we can discuss  Wednesday expanding our reach a bit
[05:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> And the result was generally us taking notes, but not being entirely sure what to do for a lot of them: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/49747935/Pull%20Request%20Reviews
[05:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice there are a lot that say "need CSS review"
[05:33:31] <mikesherov> yeah, that's from that oksoclap doc
[05:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> We used to have a design team, but they defected to Mobile :-P
[05:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:33:57] <mikesherov> so do we need 1 css guy?
[05:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> So those reviews never happened.
[05:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> We've been doing ok since we accepted reality and stopped relying on the old design team.
[05:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> But having someone really knowledgable in CSS would certainly help.
[05:34:42] <mikesherov> right
[05:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then you'll notice that some of them have comments like "can we fix the underyling bug" or "can be addressed by .ui-front?" or "wait until refactor"
[05:36:38] <mikesherov> sure, I mean, my main concern is simply how it looks from an outsider perspective.
[05:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> And I felt like I couldn't prioritize that research ahead of the 1.9 plugins.
[05:36:46] <mikesherov> yeah, I agree 100%
[05:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I've had the same concern for a long time.
[05:36:54] <mikesherov> I understand the choices you guys made
[05:37:08] <mikesherov> it makes total sense
[05:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> Right now it's very hard to contribute to UI if it's not something on the roadmap for the next release.
[05:37:14] <mikesherov> yup
[05:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> And that sucks.
[05:37:32] <mikesherov> and I guess I'm saying that I'd like my contribution to be changing that perception / reality
[05:37:38] <mikesherov> it started with the bug tracker cleanup
[05:37:44] <mikesherov> next it'll be the PR queue
[05:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> Right, and I think they are.
[05:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> So, something like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/185
[05:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> We can't land that, because it'll just add to the pile.
[05:38:14] <mikesherov> right
[05:38:27] <mikesherov> and it makes sens for that to wait for a milestone release
[05:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> lindstroem knows this, so he's just waiting.
[05:38:40] <mikesherov> I get waiting on the features
[05:39:13] <mikesherov> I'm saying that, given tests and and a responsive contributor, we should land any bug fix
[05:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> As I mentioned before, we've had lots of regressions in interactions when landing fixes.
[05:39:18] <mikesherov> that'll tackle 90% of the queue
[05:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which you've now seen first hand with the floating sortable bug.
[05:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> So getting the test suites passing and requiring tests will definitley help there.
[05:39:50] <mikesherov> sure, but I've also seen that happen because the original fix had no tests
[05:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> But I have a feeling that building up the test suite will just bring in even more regressions along the way.
[05:40:09] <mikesherov> I can't tell BlazeCell to fix it, because what he'd need to do first is write tests for the original fix!
[05:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> right
[05:40:41] <mikesherov> Well, I mean, I think it's my duty to speak in defense of tests here
[05:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> So in that case it might be better to just revert the fix and go back to the original fixer and ask for a new patch with tests.
[05:41:06] <mikesherov> sure
[05:41:15] <mikesherov> but I don't personally see how building up a test suite could ever bring in more regressions.
[05:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> Though we should probably add a test for the floating bug before asking him for tests for his fixes.
[05:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Building up the test suite isn't what's going to cause regressions.
[05:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's making a change and testing for that bug fix without knowing about all the other use cases that we're supporting.
[05:41:57] <mikesherov> yup
[05:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> So if this guy had submitted tests with his 3 fixes, they would've all passed, and we'd still have a regression.
[05:42:08] <mikesherov> makes sense
[05:42:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure, but we'd be in the same place anyway
[05:42:42] <mikesherov> I mean, we'd be in the position now for BlazeCell to fix it again with tests
[05:42:48] <mikesherov> and then both cases are covered.
[05:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which unfortunately means long term stable, sort term unstable.
[05:43:16] <mikesherov> yup
[05:43:16] <mikesherov> that might be something we're willing to accept?
[05:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we're willing to act quickly on regressions.
[05:43:56] <mikesherov> I'm probably more aggressive than what you're used to :-)
[05:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> In the past, if I landed an interaction fix and it caused a regression, I'd immediately revert and inform the author of the fix.
[05:44:27] <mikesherov> I'm willing to deal with it for 2 reasons
[05:45:01] <mikesherov> 1. it'll create a test suite that serves as the basis for the rewrite
[05:45:20] <mikesherov> 2. it'll show the community that we're engaged in fixing these plugins through active contribution
[05:45:20] <mikesherov> '
[05:45:50] <mikesherov> I get the scope creep and focused efforts and whatnot
[05:46:06] <mikesherov> I'm saying, let me deal with the community, and the optics of that side of things
[05:46:17] <mikesherov> while you guys keep taking it block by block
[05:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:46:47] <mikesherov> and if it blows up in my face, well then, lesson learned
[05:46:50] <mikesherov> :-P
[05:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, 1.9 was supposed to be this magical thing that finally gave us time to spend some time on things that had gotten stale.
[05:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> But then I went and put a super tight timeline on 1.10 for Drupal.
[05:47:30] <mikesherov> isn't that always the case
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> you've made the right moves
[05:48:18] <mikesherov> we just need a multipronged approach now that we have the manpower again
[05:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:48:53] <mikesherov> like, menubar for example… me fixing that doesn't really get us anything.
[05:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> No, I'd rather you focus on the released code.
[05:49:15] <mikesherov> right
[05:49:33] <mikesherov> on the roadmap, it says "clean up the pull request queue"
[05:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and kborchers_ are mostly on the unreleased side.
[05:49:50] <mikesherov> I've kind of just taken that without really asking for it :-)
[05:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Plus Felix on selectmenu.
[05:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> And rxaviers will be there too once download builder dies down a bit.
[05:50:35] <mikesherov> great
[05:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to go through the 139 emails in my inbox now...
[05:51:20] <mikesherov> so, my approach is, if the contributor is active and responsive, and provides tests… I'll land the fix. That's really the only way I'll learn the codebase too… seeing what they changed and why
[05:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:51:57] <mikesherov> that'll def cause a few regressions,so I'll bring it up at the meeting
[05:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:52:11] <mikesherov> just so everyone knows I'm actively going to break stuff :-)
[05:52:43] <mikesherov> anyway, g2g also. Thanks for filling me in

[05:59:46] <doesallmagic> * rxaviers: Update base fixture of ThemeRoller unit test to release 1.9.1
[06:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8806#comment:5 The old workaround can't be used anymore, but I think this should stay as wontfix.
[06:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> We used to use `.addClass( "ui-tabs-hide" )` and now we use `.hide()`. So there's not clean way for him to stop the `display: none;`.
[06:04:21] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez !important will still trump it http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/cwaA2/
[06:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: so clever.
[06:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if that breaks animations.
[06:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't care if it does, but it'd be interesting.
[06:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Make sure to check milestones when landing pulls since we have them set based on the roadmap: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5295#comment:19
[06:45:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #92: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/92/
[07:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Hey, wanted to run something by you about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/2208
[07:38:14] <petersendidit> yes
[07:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking about this over the weekend (I didn't even realize that Mike had landed it at the time), and I was wondering when people actually do this.
[07:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> I know I told you it was legit and that you should implement it.
[07:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> For a long time we were trying to get parity between accordion and tabs.
[07:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> But we're actually pretty far away from that.
[07:39:37] <petersendidit> Disable individual panes in the accordion?
[07:39:56] <scott_gonzalez> Right, we already closed a ticket for that as wontfix, because we didn't know of use cases.
[07:40:18] <petersendidit> ok
[07:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> And we have different ARIA handling between them (even though they're semantically equivalent).
[07:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> And we use delayed activations on tabs, but not accordions.
[07:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to think of when accordions are used with dynamic panels.
[07:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> So far I've only thought of something like mail clients where each account is in a panel.
[07:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> But those are individually collapsible panels, not an accordion with a single open panel.
[07:42:01] <petersendidit> yea
[07:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> The thing that got me started thinking about this was that the other day I noticed the change is +.5kb
[07:42:32] <petersendidit> the refresh change?
[07:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> For something that probably very few people will use.
[07:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:42:49] <petersendidit> well the refresh change allows you to add remove panels
[07:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so I'm trying to figure out what existing sites/apps do this.
[07:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any.
[07:43:37] <petersendidit> I could see a accodion that is a wizard, and depending on what you choose you might need to add a few steps
[07:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think we've heard that for a few different things and we always say to build a wizard widget on top of accordion.
[07:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's a very specific use of accordion.
[07:44:41] <petersendidit> Yea
[07:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> One in which you can only move in specific directions.
[07:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Also, accordions aren't the best interface for wizards.
[07:44:57] <petersendidit> yup
[07:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> I feel bad telling you to implement this and then questioning the value :-/
[07:45:27] <petersendidit> its all good
[07:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> In my head, I was still in "synchronize with tabs" mode
[07:45:46] <petersendidit> I like the idea of all of our widgets haveing a refresh method
[07:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm starting to think we need to abandon that thought.
[07:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> In reality, people do not use accordions and tabs in the same way.
[07:46:10] <petersendidit> yea
[07:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: In regards to all widgets haven't a refresh method, I'm not sure if all widgets make sense.
[07:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, what would refreshing a dialog do?
[07:47:22] <petersendidit> true
[07:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> Or a progressbar.
[07:47:55] <petersendidit> I am suprized that it added that much
[07:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, how did I type "haven't" instead of "having"?
[07:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> Me too.
[07:48:16] <petersendidit> it was basily moving code around
[07:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> Let me run this again, the source number was huge.
[07:50:17] <petersendidit> no it went up a good chunk
[07:50:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe it was a rebasing issue or something.
[07:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting +127 on the commit in master.
[07:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's not so bad.
[07:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> +1126 in source, which is still kind of surprising.
[07:51:22] <petersendidit> The big part that got added was the logic to figure out the new state of things and handle it correctly
[07:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> But +127 min+gzip isn't nearly as bad the >500 that I saw the other day.
[07:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was probably because I was comparing your branch to master and master had changed.
[07:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> There was probably stuff removed in master that still existed in your branch.
[07:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, for +127 I say we'll keep it :-)
[07:52:31] <petersendidit> ok
[07:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:52:38] <petersendidit> ;-)
[07:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Did you see that I added the style check to domEqual()?
[07:54:28] <petersendidit> yes
[07:54:32] <petersendidit> good stuff
[07:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> And now we've got a bug to fix in accordion in IE8 :-/ http://swarm.jquery.org/result/442882
[07:54:50] <petersendidit> hehe
[07:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> I love how a single browser has a style issue.
[07:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> errr...IE7.
[07:56:11] <petersendidit> overflow visible vs scroll really? weird
[07:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:57:20] <petersendidit> I kinda think we need a async domEqual
[07:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> We could do that.
[07:57:41] <petersendidit> check what the dom is now, do some of the ajax stuff in tabs, then compaire
[07:58:03] <petersendidit> because the tabs logic around the ajax stuff adds/removes classes attributes
[07:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> We can do the lovely `if ( modifier.length )` test and pass a callback to the modifier function.
[07:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let me test that out.
[08:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, for some reason we're passing a jQuery object to the modifier.
[08:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use that anywhere, so I'm going to remove it.
[08:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can see why it was done, but no point in refactoring all the uses of it.
[08:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/ebfa845d657d3174471e
[08:08:25] <petersendidit> nice
[08:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> We should really beef up our domEqual() tests.
[08:09:03] <petersendidit> yes
[08:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> While testing this I noticed that even just doing $( "#tabs2" ).tabs().tabs( "destroy" ) fails the test.
[08:09:44] <petersendidit> what causes the fail?
[08:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> aria-controls on the custom id.
[08:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like .data() isn't being cleared.

[10:29:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: I lost my IRC backlog - what did I miss today?
[10:31:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: while the travis output is a little annoying to parse (I want the last section at the top), its pretty useful here: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/546 - will the mergatron integration look similar?
[10:32:04] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: it'll be the jenkins output
[10:32:31] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: and then what it can do on top of that is comment on the PR inline for violations… but that needs to be built up
[10:33:03] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: makes sense, thanks. Would be nice to output the interesting lines in a comment.
[10:33:33] <mikesherov> mergeatron parses the jenkins output, so that's definitely a possibility
[10:54:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what's your status on download builder? Do you need input somewhere?
[10:54:54] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Im working here https://gist.github.com/4038528

[12:09:27] <rxaviers> ops
[12:09:31] <rxaviers> 5days
[12:09:34] <jzaefferer> ah :-)
[12:09:37] <rxaviers> sorry
[12:09:38] <rxaviers> kk
[12:09:55] <rxaviers> let me fix that
[12:10:02] <jzaefferer> also brake != break
[12:10:56] <jzaefferer> 1h for "show multiple versions" seems optimistic. Will likely need more than one iteration
[12:11:22] <jzaefferer> otherwise looking good. Looking forward to having multi version support next week ;)
[12:13:03] <rxaviers> yeah! We'll probably have more than one iteration in other places too. So, that plan will be a v0 for multi version.
[12:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: When multiple version support lands, it'll still support having just one version listed, right?
[12:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> Multiple version support will hopefully land before 1.9.2.
[12:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> And when we release 1.9.2, we'll still only be showing one version.
[12:17:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeap, it will!
[12:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> great :-)
[12:17:48] <rxaviers> :)
[12:19:16] <rxaviers> Im willing to make DB more consistent on that change
[12:19:59] <rxaviers> the error handling is better, and `grunt prepare` is better
[13:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? petersendidit: The accordion failure is such a mess.
[13:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is the cause of the bug: $( this ).height()
[13:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> How does that possibly change the overflow?
[13:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin mikesherov: ^
[13:12:56] <mikesherov> Never use .height() when you mean .css(height);
[13:14:57] <petersendidit> Because IE7 is magical
[13:15:21] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: I think I can recreate the problem on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8809
[13:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Well, the fiddle shows the problem, I just want him to reduce it even more.
[13:15:56] <petersendidit> ok
[13:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it should be marked valid, but it really needs a better description.
[13:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: So I should change this to .css( "height" ) ?
[13:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L345-352
[13:19:04] <mikesherov> I dunno. Sorry, busy at the moment actually. Will check shortly
[13:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:48:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! I thought you showed me something at summit regarding a note on how to attach event handlers... in the ui docs or the api docs... But I cannot find it again! Did I dream this? Thanks :-)

[21:02:40] <MrMister> Any thought on the right approach to handling top-level links in the menubar plugin?  There are a few notes on the wiki about it, but no formal tickets or discussion that I can find
