[11:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers: I think marking all non-anchored menu items as dividers is too aggressive.
[11:41:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, menu expects a menu item to have an anchor otherwise
[11:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> So you can't have any text that's not a menu item?
[11:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> Like opt groups in a select element.
[11:43:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nope, remember we decided not to do groups
[11:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you tell Felix to push to master?
[11:44:21] <scott_gonzalez> we did?

[11:44:43] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on jquery-ui by fnagel (1h, 28m ago): Autocomplete: make categories work again
[11:45:52] <scott_gonzalez> I remember discussing it, but I don't remember when we decided not to support it.
[11:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> I believe you, but I don't remember it.
[11:46:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I told him that. Apparently not such a good idea, even with such a seemingly simple change
[11:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> He pushed his bad commit and then his fix commit.
[11:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even feel like this is the right fix.
[11:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[11:47:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i remember we decided not to do it because opt groups weren't really anywhere in a desktop menu system, but dividers were so we implemented that. i believe that's how it went
[11:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is refreshing my memory :-)
[11:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> Now that you've mentioned that, this is what I remember:
[11:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> We looked at what selects actually do.
[11:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> And what they do is provide a line in the menu that has text and styling but is not a menu item.
[11:48:35] <scott_gonzalez> And they style the actual menu items differently (with indentation)
[11:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> But from the AT perspective, it's just the menu items.
[11:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> Making all non-anchor elements into dividers seems to make that impossible.
[11:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> Or at least requires style overrides which seem strange.
[11:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what Felix did.
[11:49:46] <kborchers> right
[11:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> So, thoughts on relaxing that?
[11:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe empty menu items or menu items that only contain dashes/hyphens?
[11:52:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so is the goal here to be able to do opt group type styling or just don't like the aggresiveness?
[11:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> Something a little more lenient than /^[-]*$/.test( item.text() )
[11:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> opt group type styling
[11:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the heading.
[11:53:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, wouldn't that require more than just an item without an anchor but instead a whole new structure so you know when the group ends?
[11:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[11:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's not what native selects do.
[11:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why we said that the concept of an optgroup shouldn't exist in menu.
[11:53:58] <kborchers> i see
[11:54:07] <kborchers> so you would just add another empty item after the group
[11:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> No, the optgroups wouldn't be empty items.
[11:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> They'd be the group label
[11:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> <li>Group 1</li>
[11:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> <li><a>g1i1</a></li>
[11:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> <li><a>g1i2</a></li>
[11:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> <li>Group 2</li>
[11:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> <li><a>g2i1</a></li>
[11:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever is generating those items would apply classes to the group lis.
[11:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> In order to style them appropriately.
[11:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> But as far as the menu widget is concerned it's just a menu with menu items.
[11:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> There just happen to be a few list items that aren't menu items.
[11:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> There could be items that are dividers.
[11:56:02] <scott_gonzalez>  /^[-]*$/.test( item.text() )
[11:56:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what if i want a group followed by ungrouped items. or are you saying the actual text of the anchor determines group membership?
[11:56:42] <scott_gonzalez>  /^[-\s<other-types-of-dashes-too>]*$/.test( item.text() )
[11:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> The menu widget shouldn't care about that. It's up to the person creating the lis to care.
[11:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> As far as the menu is concerned, it's a flat structure.
[11:57:53] <kborchers> i'm thinking in terms of styling the grouped items to show group membership
[11:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> Whoever is generating the lis would add classes to the grouped lis.
[11:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> <li class="in-optgroup"><a>...</a></li>
[11:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> <li><a>not in optgroup</a></li>
[11:58:39] <kborchers> i see
[11:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> <li class="optgroup-header">what's up now?</li>
[11:59:00] <kborchers> well, if we're not styling then that shouldn't be too bad. i can hack on that tonight
[11:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> And the menu widget just sees: <li>...<li> or <li><a>...</a></li>
[11:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> And we can keep the divider logic, but instead of just checking for the lack of an anchor, it also checks the text of the anchor.
[12:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> So <li><li> and <li>-<li> and <li>---</li> and <li> - </li> are all dividers.
[12:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> <li>-a<li> is not
[12:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> We should handle em and en dashes too.

[12:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, reverted Felix's commits.
[12:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> Now we've got 4!!! annoying commits.
[12:02:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so if the text is any combination of -, en, em or space, it's a divider.
[12:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, as long as those are the only characters.
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Or if it's completley empty.
[12:02:51] <kborchers> if there is any text, it's just a disabled menu item
[12:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> I supposed that could be simplified to /[^-\s]/.test()
[12:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> Not disabled, it's not a menu item.
[12:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> You should completely skip over it.
[12:03:25] <kborchers> right, sorry
[12:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, sounds like we're on the same page now.
[12:03:53] <kborchers> ok, should be able to knock that and some visual/unit tests tonight
[12:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> You can use the autocomplete categories demo as a test also :-)
[12:04:30] <kborchers> ok :)
[12:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it's lunch time for her.
[12:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> I just pinged her, hopefully she'll reply when she gets back.
[12:07:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: heh, wrong window
[12:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> d'oh
