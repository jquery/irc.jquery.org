[04:42:25] <M4rius> ping scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: For using pointer events in interaction.js, I essentially only changed the ms-pointerevents hook to a pointerevents hook. With PEP.js preloaded, this works really nice so far. Should I write unit-tests/visual tests for interaction.js?
[04:47:49] <M4rius> Or am I totally barking up the wrong tree? I feel like this should have been a lot more than changing 5 lines. >.>
[05:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: The entire abstraction should go away.
[05:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> Event objects should be passed directly to the widgets.
[05:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> There's an old attempt from kborchers in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/interactions-polymer
[05:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> But it's based on an old polyfill.

[05:54:58] <M4rius> scott_gonzalez: ok...sorry, I am really confused now. Are you saying the whole interactions.js abstraction should go away, or just the hooks? Don't event objects get passed to the widgets via _start(), _move() and _stop() ?
[06:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> The hooks should go away.
[06:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: Right now widgets are using an abstraction for the positioning. Instead they should use the event objects directly.
[06:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> That abstraction had to exist because of the differences in event types.
[06:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we have Pointer Events to standardize on, we don't need an abstraction anymore.
[06:06:07] <M4rius> Ah ok. Yeah makes sense, with only pointer events
[06:14:37] <kumarrishav> arschmitz: hey there..
[06:16:53] <M4rius> scott_gonzalez: With the hooks taken out, PEP.js wired in and some test cases, would a pull request for the interactions branch be the next thing to do?
[06:17:32] <kumarrishav> arschmitz: want to discuss https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List#jquery-ui---new-demo-system
[06:18:17] <M4rius> *by wired in, i mean adding it to externals
[06:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> M4rius: yes
[06:28:09] <M4rius> okey dokey
[06:32:52] <arschmitz> M4rius: Hi not all of that issue can be worked on yet
[06:33:07] <arschmitz> but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more
[06:33:20] <arschmitz> M4rius:  also please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[06:33:21] <M4rius> Hi arschmitz, I feel like you have been saying that a lot lately :D
[06:33:53] <arschmitz> M4rius: well if you have seen me say it to every one else why did you ask ? ;-)
[06:34:13] <M4rius> Wait, did I?
[06:34:21] <arschmitz> M4rius: no sorry
[06:34:31] <arschmitz> thats my fault it was right next to your message
[06:34:36] <M4rius> np :)
[06:34:51] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: everything i just said to M4rius
[06:35:00] <arschmitz> :-D
[06:35:05] <M4rius> :>>
[06:38:56] <kumarrishav> arschmitz: is it necessary to build on vm .
[06:39:14] <arschmitz> build on vm?
[06:40:46] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: do you mean deploy jqueryui.com to our vagrant vm?
[06:41:02] <kumarrishav> yeah
[06:41:16] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: if so thats actually unrelated at this point the demos are in jquery-ui repo not the website repo
[06:41:26] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: they are added to the website as part of release
[06:41:48] <kumarrishav> yeah..but this issue https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/94
[06:42:08] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: right as i mentioned not all of the task can be worked on yet
[06:42:19] <kumarrishav> seems to be part of jquery-wp-content
[06:42:23] <kumarrishav> okay..
[06:42:23] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more
[06:44:30] <kumarrishav> so, i want to improve a demo or add new demo, i have file issue first ..right? then go forward with pr
[06:44:46] <kumarrishav> *if i want to
[06:44:52] <kumarrishav> arschmitz: 
[06:45:16] <arschmitz> kumarrishav: yes
[06:45:30] <kumarrishav> oh..cool thanks :)
[08:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: ETA for classes update?
[08:26:32] <arschmitz> oh its done i finished friday
[08:26:40] <arschmitz> forgot i never pushed it just a sec and i will
[08:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[08:33:47] <rusposevkin> Hi guys! I'm interested in creating new demo system for jqueryui.com in the context of GSoC. At first I'm learn info at contribute.jquery.org and try to create workflow for local development. But encouraged with this bug: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/102 . I'd like to create a prototype of new demo system. Is it will be ok if I create an
[08:33:47] <rusposevkin> independent system (not deployed into jquery-wp)?
[08:34:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: done
[08:34:46] <arschmitz> rusposevkin: that part of the task cannot be worked on yet
[08:35:02] <arschmitz> rusposevkin: we already have a plan to use the jsbin api once its available
[08:35:14] <arschmitz> rusposevkin: but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more
[08:35:27] <arschmitz> rusposevkin: also please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students if you have not already
[08:38:12] <rusposevkin> Is there a repository with some code of new demo? Or  new plan is just using jsbin.com for new demo system?
[08:38:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: actually going to push again there have been some changes on master that conflict 
[08:38:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i just fixed them just a sec
[08:38:44] <arschmitz> rusposevkin: all our demos live in the jquery-ui repo
[08:38:56] <arschmitz> and get depolyed to jqueryui.com as part of the release process
[08:39:12] <arschmitz> this will continue to be the case now they wil just deploy to both jqueryui.com and jsbin
[08:39:41] <arschmitz> this will be an automatic process which is why we need the jsbin api which is not ready yet
[08:42:06] <eiroh> i'm a GSoC aspirant and would like to contribute to jquery. can somebody help me with idea : new demo system
[08:42:11] <rusposevkin> arschmitz: ok, thanks. I'll try to improve current demos.
[08:43:15] <arschmitz> eiroh: Not all of that task can be worked on yet. The jsbin integration is waiting on some things. but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more. also please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students if you have not already
[08:44:01] <eiroh> arschmitz: ok thx

[11:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll jzaefferer: Is it time for us to create a function for getting document.activeElement?
[11:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> We have a few places where we do the try/catch and a few places where we don't.
[11:57:42] <tj_vantoll> I think so.
[11:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> $.ui.activeElement( document ) ?
[11:58:24] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Does mobile have one of these?
[11:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> I kind of want to return document.body instead of null if we hit the catch case.
[12:00:11] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: we have a pr for it
[12:00:18] <arschmitz> or a suggestion one of the two
[12:00:22] <arschmitz> from gabriel_schulhof
[12:01:20] <tj_vantoll> $.ui.safeActiveElement( document )
[12:02:05] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: if we add to ui thought i would remove the need in mobile 
[12:02:38] <tj_vantoll> To avoid putting something in core.js this could go in the widget factory, although it's kind of messy there.
[12:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I think you're thinking of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7927
[12:03:10] <tj_vantoll> $.Widget._safeActiveElement
[12:04:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup thats what i was thinking of
[12:04:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on returning document.body instead of undefined?
[12:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: We need this outside of widgets too.
[12:05:15] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: we use it outside widgets
[12:05:50] <tj_vantoll> ah
[12:06:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the only thing with body is you will 100% need to guard anywhere its used with blur like the mobile pr you linked to
[12:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> You have to do that anyway.
[12:06:24] <arschmitz> true
[12:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> The body is the default focused eleemnt.
[12:06:33] <arschmitz> eah
[12:06:39] <arschmitz> ok so that makes since
[12:06:47] <tj_vantoll> agreed
[12:07:29] <arschmitz> if it errors give default makes sense to me
[12:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> So should we add $.ui.safeBlur()?
[12:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> We may only be doing that once in UI right now.
[12:09:36] <arschmitz> they make sense together
[12:09:49] <arschmitz> yeah we use it a lot in mobile
[12:10:04] <arschmitz> well i should not say a lot
[12:10:09] <arschmitz> but i know more then once
[12:10:45] <arschmitz> twice is all i see right now to be fair
[12:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well, once we split core into a hundred files, the bytes won't matter :-P
[12:11:28] <arschmitz> true
[12:11:37] <arschmitz> and they two functions do make sense together
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't put them in the same file.
[12:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> We'll definitely use safeActiveElement() more.
[12:13:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i didnt mean in same file
[12:13:20] <arschmitz> i just meant to have both 
[12:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> This will not work the way that Mobile PR works.
[12:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> It will blur the element that's passed, it won't be searching within windows and documents.
[12:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> The API in that PR is whacky.
[12:15:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: still just a pr :-)
[12:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2dfe85d3e2269a571e07bd550bbd838ee703b833#diff-bd5d7db0e6a3ff783a7ec2ccf261f6b4R190
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the bug #, then scroll up and read the bug # from the commit message.
[12:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's quite a typo ;-)
[12:21:58] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Whoops :)
[12:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> I was hoping the ticket would have a comment like "This works properly in IE11"
[12:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Guess I'll have to do a simple test.
[12:22:56] <tj_vantoll> It does.
[12:23:38] <tj_vantoll> The <body> blur bug is IE9–10, the iframe access one is IE9 only.
[12:23:50] <tj_vantoll> http://tjvantoll.com/2013/08/30/bugs-with-document-activeelement-in-internet-explorer/
[12:24:08] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: of course you have a blog about it ready to go :-)
[12:24:23] <tj_vantoll> I apparently never got around to updating the // Support comments
[12:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, prefect. Thanks tj_vantoll.
[12:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> The introduction of "only" on support comments is so useful.
[12:27:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah we need to land that support comment update on contribute
[12:27:16] <arschmitz> because it does make things very easy and clear
[12:27:23] <tj_vantoll> +1
[12:27:36] <arschmitz> iv just been trying to follow it anyway lol
[12:28:16] <arschmitz> right now the hardest part is that i need to go find the pr every time lol 
[12:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, this whole block: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2dfe85d3e2269a571e07bd550bbd838ee703b833#diff-bd5d7db0e6a3ff783a7ec2ccf261f6b4R184
[12:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> becomes: $.ui.safeBlur( $.ui.safeActiveElement( this.document[ 0 ] ) );
[12:30:33] <arschmitz> oh i guess there is no pr
[12:30:43] <arschmitz> which is why it always takes me so long to find its just an issue
[12:30:48] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/95
[12:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> If there was a PR, then it would already have landed.
[12:31:10] <scott_gonzalez> We're apparently blocked on jQuery 3 :-(
[12:32:36] <arschmitz> oh lame

[12:42:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: absolutely 
[12:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> And just drop them when we drop the browsers.
[12:43:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: id prefer the same
[12:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...we'll probably want a way to signify that a module should not be listed in download builder.
[12:44:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that came up on mobile too last week
[12:45:01] <arschmitz> that we wanted to be able to have certain modules hidden

Yaaay!
[14:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: GitHub is being annoying with commit ordering again.
[14:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's so frustrating.
[14:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's apparently not even sorted by author date.
[14:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> I can't even find a flag in `git log` that will result in this whacky order.
[14:43:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i dont know i always thought it was author order
[14:43:43] <arschmitz> but its not
[14:43:48] <arschmitz> i dont know what it is
[14:44:00] <arschmitz> because i fixed it with a push last week
[14:44:06] <arschmitz> and now i pushed again and its back
[14:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> git log --just-slightly-fucked-order
[14:44:15] <arschmitz> ha ha
[14:44:35] <arschmitz> but you can clearly see if you do git log nothing has changed
[14:44:56] <arschmitz> and that the commits have ALWAYS been in the right order despite github
[14:45:27] <arschmitz> there may have been things within a commit i moved but the commits them selves have not changed in quite some time
[14:46:26] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: its super annoying on long prs like this thoug

[14:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> I notice this on every review, I don't know why I kept putting it off.
[14:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> I know I didn't say anything the first time because there were lots of changes happening in this block of tests and I was waiting to see if it'd stay around.
[14:47:33] <arschmitz> lol
[14:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pointing this out because I'm not sure if my comment is clear.
[14:47:48] <arschmitz> cant answer that one but now that you point it out ill fix it
[14:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you understand what I'm saying in that comment?
[14:48:51] <arschmitz> yes when it prints it prints ( element, keys, null toggle )
[14:49:03] <arschmitz> instead of ( element, keys, null, toggle )
[14:49:25] <arschmitz> or
[14:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> It prints a space before the comma.
[14:50:00] <arschmitz> well not exactly
[14:50:02] <arschmitz> but yea
[14:50:29] <arschmitz> yeah anyway i know what you mean
[14:50:46] <arschmitz> simple fix

[15:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> I was just going through the outdated diff comments.
[15:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't even notice.
[15:13:41] <arschmitz> i made the changes to core and just accidently rebased them into the hasclasses commit instead of the classes commit into the wrong previously existing commit 
[15:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> Good thing you can't slap me through the Internet ;-)
[15:13:54] <arschmitz> lol
[15:14:11] <arschmitz> i think that feeling may often be mutual :-)
[15:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I had a lot of comments on that file.
[15:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid progressbar.
[15:15:14] <arschmitz> lol
[15:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's so simple, what could go wrong :-P
[15:15:53] <arschmitz> right because when you start calculating percentages in chrome everything is always awesome 
[15:17:20] <arschmitz> or really doing math in general in JS
[15:20:34] <apsdehal> Do we want commits like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7986 for prototype of QUnit upgrade for jQuery Mobile project?
[15:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to watch out for a real slap next time I see you https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/9611bb0e4fa52dba38d8b144fcc0c3219d33f462#commitcomment-10110179
[15:28:40] <arschmitz> oh i saw that one already :-p
[15:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, so maany of them.
[15:30:07] <arschmitz> lol
[15:30:10] <arschmitz> copy and paste
[15:31:06] <apsdehal> Anyone, the above question?
[15:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: See apsdehal's question
[15:36:19] <arschmitz> apsdehal: partially
[15:36:33] <arschmitz> apsdehal: leobalter made a tool that will do most of the actual test conversion
[15:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I think in the interest of getting this into master, I'm going to avoid commenting on the lack of widget classes in markup structure tests.
[15:37:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: up to you i dont mind adding them
[15:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well in that case, can you just go through all the widgets and check them?
[15:37:53] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i dont have a link to that right now though
[15:37:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sure
[15:37:59] <apsdehal> So, does that mean the project is going to be scrapped?
[15:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> You'll find them just as easily and there'll be less noise than me commenting.
[15:38:11] <arschmitz> apsdehal: im not sure what you mean?
[15:38:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i started doing that and i think i just forgot at some point lol
[15:38:38] <arschmitz> checking them against the api
[15:38:53] <arschmitz> not the api but the demos
[15:39:04] <apsdehal> So If there is a tool that can do most of the conversion, do we still need a separate upgrade project?
[15:39:20] <arschmitz> apsdehal: thats just the api upgrade for qunit
[15:39:26] <arschmitz> there a LOT more to that task then that
[15:39:33] <arschmitz> thats the small / easy part of it
[15:39:52] <apsdehal> So what do I focus onto next?
[15:42:43] <apsdehal> https://github.com/leobalter/qunit-migrate
[15:42:55] <apsdehal> I think this is the project you are talking about.
[15:45:13] <arschmitz> yup
[15:45:33] <arschmitz> apsdehal: you could start looking at intern
[15:45:50] <arschmitz> we will be looking at using this for cross browser function testing soon
[15:46:51] <apsdehal> Checking out of leobalter's project, it seems to me it just notifies what all has to be changed for migrating from QUnit 1.4 to 2.0
[15:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Done.
[15:49:45] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Next part would be cleanup of tests, as mentioned by you.
[15:50:17] <apsdehal> And the final part would be to make pass tests in every browser (possibly using intern)
[15:50:35] <apsdehal> Am I right?
[15:50:43] <arschmitz> essentially
[15:51:03] <apsdehal> So for prototype, what should I do next? Cleanup?
[15:52:07] <arschmitz> apsdehal: i would start with the pr you have but use the tool to fix the rest
[15:52:27] <arschmitz> apsdehal: then move on to test clean up
[15:53:24] <apsdehal> cool. thanks.
[15:54:07] <arschmitz> apsdehal: ill review that pr in the next day or so
[15:54:14] <arschmitz> what you have so far
[15:55:26] <apsdehal> Thanks. I have upgraded QUnit version in bower.json + migrated some of tests. I will look out for your comments
[16:07:35] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Also any specific area that needs a lot of cleanup?
