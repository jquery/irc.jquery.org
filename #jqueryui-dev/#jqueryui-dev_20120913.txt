[04:00:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf kborchers: updated http://qunitjs.com/ to 1.10 - I've also removed the filesizes, that seemed very much unnecessary
[04:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thanks, that does appear to be a regression.
[04:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add it to my list.
[05:14:45] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: That's weird, I don't know why it worked for me the first time I tested with 1.8.23.
[05:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> This is *not* a regression.
[05:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's been broken for at lesat 3 years.
[05:34:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool, i'll leave it alone then. were you able to reproduce outside of that demo though. a very minimal sortable test didn't seem to do it so i was starting to think it was just a bug in the demo but i could have just been tired and frustrated
[05:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't try to reduce it since it wasn't a regression.
[05:37:17] <jzaefferer> xavier_: I'm now working on a grunt task for building themes for a jQuery UI release
[05:37:42] <jzaefferer> I probably need access to the themeroller module's css function...
[05:37:49] <jzaefferer> not quite sure yet how that works
[05:38:16] <xavier_> jzaefferer, `theme = new ThemeRoller(vars)`
[05:38:29] <xavier_> jzaefferer, `theme.css()` -> outputs the parsed css
[05:38:44] <xavier_> jzaefferer, to get the images, you need to:
[05:38:45] <jzaefferer> where do I get that vars for all preset themes?
[05:39:24] <xavier_> jzaefferer, I got them from the live ThemeRoller and put it here: lib/themeroller.themegallery.js
[05:40:00] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[05:40:38] <xavier_> actually, if you `themeGallery = require("./lib/themeroller.themegallery.js ")`, you get an array of all themes. Where `themeGallery[x].name` is the preset name, and you have access to its css with themeGallery[x].css()
[05:40:44] <jzaefferer> how about I just add another export to download.js, that returns a list with theme names and css content...?
[05:41:09] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[05:41:12] <jzaefferer> that makes it easy
[05:41:15] <xavier_> ;)
[05:41:47] <jzaefferer> have you looked into installing web-base-template yet?
[05:41:57] <xavier_> will do it now
[05:42:19] <xavier_> How would you handle the images for each theme above?
[05:42:29] <xavier_> Are you going to create a subdir with each theme and its images?
[05:43:24] <jzaefferer> good question
[05:43:35] <jzaefferer> I'll start with the css files
[05:44:22] <xavier_> Ok. To get the images, you can use this: `theme.fetchImages(function( imageFiles ){})`
[05:45:08] <xavier_> where imageFiles = {path: <filename>, data: <data>}
[05:47:05] <jzaefferer> okay
[05:47:10] <jzaefferer> data is a Buffer?
[06:00:59] <jzaefferer> xavier_: how do I get at the "encoded" name? For example, "Dot Luv" is encoded as "dot-luv"
[06:01:53] <xavier_> jzaefferer, mm I dont have that. I think we can add a new variable to each entry having that info
[06:02:13] <jzaefferer> so how to you name the folders for the download currently?
[06:03:54] <jzaefferer> xavier_: ^^^
[06:05:10] <jzaefferer> adding this: theme.id = item.name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/, "-")
[06:05:18] <xavier_> jzaefferer, right! we need it anyway. I've reserved a folderName var for this.
[06:06:49] <xavier_> jzaefferer, ok. So, please assume you can access that info with theme.folderName
[06:07:17] <xavier_> actually: theme.folderName()
[06:07:54] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[06:08:24] <jzaefferer> so currently that just gives me "custom-theme"
[06:10:02] <jzaefferer> xavier_: the header in each css() file should include the /themeroller?params url, right?
[06:10:13] <jzaefferer> currently just points to http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[06:10:46] <xavier_> jzaefferer, right.. TODO
[06:10:50] <jzaefferer> kk
[06:51:22] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer created build-themes (+1 new commit): http://git.io/2ol1TA
[06:51:22] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/build-themes] Grunt: New task for downloading themes using new themeroller. Work in progress - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that some of our files don't include the XML declaration.
[06:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> I assume this is like not including a doctype in an HTML page.
[06:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Except that there's no quirks mode in XML.
[07:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Speak now or forever live with a broken XML dump :-P https://gist.github.com/3714624
[07:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> xmllint does not generate the output I would expect.
[07:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> No space between a closing tag and the next tag.
[07:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> For category descriptions should I wrap them in <desc>?
[07:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the description is just dumped in as the full content.
[07:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> <category>description</category> as opposed to <category><desc>description</desc></category>
[07:24:32] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I think it would be better in a <desc>
[07:24:43] <kswedberg> more consistent with other stuff
[07:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:25:25] <kswedberg> yeah, that lack of space between closing and opening tags is weird. oh well
[07:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not currently running it through xmllint for the file that's going on to the site.
[07:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> I just did that so it would be easier to read in the gist.
[07:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> I can run it through xmllint if we want.
[07:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> gist updated with <desc> https://gist.github.com/3714624
[07:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is the first time I've ever seen progress bars for saving a gist :-P
[07:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> I also noticed that it didn't do any syntax highlighting.
[07:27:21] <kswedberg> haha
[07:27:48] <kswedberg> bails on syntax highlighting if it's over a certain line length?
[07:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, it's a 1MB file.
[07:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's my guess.
[07:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> Probably takes too long to process.
[07:28:39] <kswedberg> crazy
[07:28:52] <kswedberg> looks great. awesome work, Scott!
[07:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[07:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> Call time.
[07:29:18] <kswedberg> yep!
[07:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: call time
[07:32:35] <kborchers> wat?
[07:32:39] <kborchers> i thought in 30
[07:32:43] <kborchers> this is crazy
[07:32:46] <kborchers> calling in a min
[07:33:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is there call info?
[07:33:54] <kborchers> nvm goti it
[07:34:42] <kborchers> seriously? sip doesn't work again
[07:54:03] <kborchers> i was too busy this morning and didn't check that e-mail, plus i had the time zones mixed up :/  sorry guys
[08:00:10] <jzaefferer> xavier_: looks like someone published a zipstream fork: https://github.com/ctalkington/node-zipstream
[08:00:24] <jzaefferer> xavier_: also https://npmjs.org/package/zipstream-ctalkington - let's give that a try
[08:01:20] <xavier_> jzaefferer, yeap, just saw that too :)
[08:01:26] <xavier_> jzaefferer, it seems he wants to maintain it
[08:01:34] <jzaefferer> yeah
[08:01:41] <jzaefferer> I don't /o\
[08:01:45] <xavier_> eheh
[08:09:50] <xavier_> jzaefferer, I've deployed wordpress, set up jquery.com virtual host, created db, user, configured, etc. Now, when I run `# npm link` in download.jqueryui.com I'm getting an error.
[08:10:08] <jzaefferer> okay, what are you getting?
[08:10:15] <xavier_> TypeError: path must be a string
[08:10:59] <xavier_> https://gist.github.com/3714973
[08:12:21] <jzaefferer> if node/npm is installed properly, you shouldn't ever have to sudo any npm calls
[08:13:04] <jzaefferer> which probably doesn't help much - I have no idea :/
[08:13:11] <xavier_> mm ok
[08:13:12] <xavier_> thks
[08:13:47] <jzaefferer> you can also install with git url into jqueryui.com, instead of linking
[08:13:50] <jzaefferer> maybe that works?
[08:14:02] <xavier_> ok
[08:19:10] <xavier_> the link worked :)
[08:19:35] <xavier_> jzaefferer, ^ it was a local stuff here :)
[08:19:48] <jzaefferer> ha, okay
[08:19:56] <jzaefferer> so everything good now?
[08:20:06] <xavier_> seems so, proceeding the setup
[08:20:10] <jzaefferer> does `grunt build-download` or even `grunt deploy` work?
[08:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: http://stage.api.jquery.com/add/#add-html
[08:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Now that we're exposing more info (types), we're linking to a type that doesn't exist.
[08:20:56] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: crisis mode here. ping me later?
[08:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: sure
[08:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just file a ticket
[08:22:27] <xavier_> jzaefferer, first Im building this using download.jqueryui.com/origin. It's working.. Then, will check the updates on themeroller
[08:22:47] <xavier_> \/o\
[08:23:28] * xavier_ 's leaving for lunch, brb
[08:25:30] <jzaefferer> okay, let me know if you're getting stuck anywhere
[09:44:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers kswedberg: just published grunt-jquery-content 0.5.0 - includes all the xsl! I just pushed the button, Scott did all the work...
[09:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:44:43] <kborchers> way to go jzaefferer!!! oh and scott_gonzalez :)
[09:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update all the API repos now.
[09:47:55] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/mwDacA
[09:47:55] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Fixed placeholders for option method. - Scott González
[09:47:55] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Upgraded grunt-jquery-content to 0.5.x. - Scott González
[09:52:40] <jzaefferer> I'm currently integrating theme generation into jQuery UI's build process
[10:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://stage.api.qunitjs.com/resources/api.xml :-)
[10:02:58] <jzaefferer> nice :-)
[10:03:28] <jzaefferer> putting an api into api docs
[10:20:55] <xavier_> jzaefferer, I've ran `grunt build-download` and `grunt deploy` on jqueryui.com and it built just fine (actually, with one worning Error: Mismatching versions. grunt-wordpress: 1.0.2; XML-RPC version: 1.0.3)
[10:21:10] <xavier_> jzaefferer, Now, I went to http://dev.jqueryui.com/download. But, I still get "This is somewhat embarrassing, isn’t it?"
[10:21:21] <xavier_> jzaefferer, Should I see the download page there?
[10:24:33] <jzaefferer> if thre's an error, it didn't deploy
[10:25:01] <jzaefferer> in this case...
[10:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> xavier_: jqueryui.com uses grunt-wordpress 1.0.3. You need to update your dependencies.
[10:25:37] <jzaefferer> yeah
[10:25:54] <jzaefferer> `git pull` jqueryui.com again, then `npm install`
[10:26:08] <jzaefferer> looks like our readmes are pretty good otherwise :-)
[10:26:19] <xavier_> they are, I had no problem
[10:26:43] <xavier_> considering one knows how to setup a virtual domain, rest is ok
[10:26:49] <jzaefferer> xavier_: when you run `grunt deploy`, it'll call `grunt build-download`, calling that one its own is useful if you just want to check console logging or the actual generated files, instead of loading it in wordpress
[10:27:06] <jzaefferer> *on its own
[10:27:25] <xavier_> jzaefferer, ok, I just wanna see it live :)
[10:28:08] <jzaefferer> sure
[10:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[10:40:29] <xavier_> jzaefferer, so cool, worked and it's very cool
[10:40:44] <xavier_> jzaefferer, good looking page
[10:40:54] <xavier_> now I can check the changes integration
[10:42:04] <xavier_> jzaefferer, we'll have the same thing for http://dev.jqueryui.com/themeroller I guess
[10:42:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sup
[10:42:49] <jzaefferer> xavier_: yep, which needs support in downloads.js
[10:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Wanted to discuss 1-8.api.jqueryui.com.
[10:42:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure
[10:43:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we use the same XML format and convert and set it up as a wordpress site ala api.jqueryui.com ?
[10:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> My thought is that we'll use the api.jqueryui.com repo and we'll tag with appropriate versions.
[10:43:34] <gnarf> okay
[10:43:38] <gnarf> maybe a 1-8 branch
[10:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we already have the 1-8 branch.
[10:43:46] <gnarf> for the stage.1-8.api.jquery.com
[10:44:02] <gnarf> @nacin to add a new domain to the multisite, what do i need to do?
[10:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> We'll tag 1.8.x for 1-8.api and 1.9.x for api.jqueryui.com
[10:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to track what the current verison is somewhere.
[10:44:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: alright, making me special case some shit, but it wont be hard
[10:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> So that we know when to deploy to the main site instead of a subsite.
[10:44:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i figured two checkouts
[10:45:11] <gnarf> one deploys to 1-8 on 1-8 branch update (stage) or /1\.8\.*/ tag
[10:45:21] <gnarf> the other master /1\.9\.*/ tag
[10:45:29] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a good idea.
[10:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> And the number of checkouts/sites will grow with every major release.
[10:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> so 1-10, 1-11, 2-0, etc.
[10:45:53] <gnarf> sure
[10:46:20] <gnarf> just need to know if i can just add a url to the mapping and not have to like "reinstall"
[10:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> This seems saner than what core does with a single site that serves content for every version.
[10:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure what the process is for adding a new site.
[10:47:08] <nacin> gnarf: yo
[10:47:26] <nacin> gnarf: just add it to domains.php and then head over to that site's URL, it will automatically install itself
[10:47:44] <gnarf> nacin: awesome
[10:48:45] <gnarf> whats the viability of just doing api.jqueryui.com/1.8/.... ?
[10:49:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ?
[10:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> Let me think about that for a while.
[10:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> That could be a good solution.
[10:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to see what needs to be shuffled around to make that work.
[10:50:28] <gnarf> seems saner than having to spin up new sites for each version
[10:50:46] <gnarf> if its plausible
[10:50:53] <gnarf> the new sites thing seems easier atm tho
[10:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll play with this.
[10:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> It would actually bring consistency with othe sites.
[10:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> view., code., etc.
[10:53:17] <gnarf> my thought too
[10:53:21] <gnarf> also most other docs sites
[10:53:28] <xavier_> jzaefferer, if you are ok with, I think somehow we'll integrate themeroller into jqueryui.com (download main as it was before, or changing names as it's now). So, I plan to first finish themeroller, check bug list and fix them if needed, then get ti jqueryui.com integration. Sound good?
[10:53:47] <xavier_> s/ti/to
[10:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> It will also avoid the need to keep all the branches in sync for dependencies, notes, etc.
[10:54:47] <jzaefferer> xavier_: yeah, just keep in mind that all the html is generated just once, so we need to pass everything from /themeroller to /download in the hash, then manipulate with JS, e.g. update the theme select
[10:56:36] <xavier_> jzaefferer, ah ok
[10:56:49] <xavier_> I see now
[10:57:22] <xavier_> what you're saying, alright. Will need to refact some stuff. Good part is that it's all js on server side or client side. Helps a little
[10:57:45] <rworth> so does that mean we're branching my copying?
[10:58:10] <xavier_> brb in 1h30
[10:58:18] <rworth> by copying
[10:58:31] <rworth> scott_gonzalez ^^
[11:07:36] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to build-themes: http://git.io/6RNHKw
[11:07:36] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/build-themes] Grunt: Replace old theme tasks with new generate_themes task. Also drop useless download_docs task. - Jörn Zaefferer
[11:07:36] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/build-themes] Grunt: We don't need request anymore, or those require statements - Jörn Zaefferer
[11:07:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you check out that branch and run release_themes, see if it looks alright?
[11:08:28] <jzaefferer> you'll also have to clone the download repo, checkout themeroller branch, and `npm link` that...
[11:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: This is going to break searching.
[11:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> And categories
[11:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> And probably a lot of other stuff that I haven't thought of yet.
[11:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If it's easier, I wouldn't be against having a separate repo for each version.
[11:17:07] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: you could do separate sites but still do api.jquery.com/1.8/...
[11:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: That sounds good.
[11:17:57] <nacin> could even leave off the version # for current (potentially — depends on desired url permanance)
[11:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> api.jqueryui.com/ and api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ can be separate sites?
[11:18:05] <nacin> yeah
[11:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[11:20:54] <jzaefferer> xavier_: I can work on integrating into the build-download task - once you're done with the other themeroller changes, you can test it yourself to verify the result
[11:37:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez nacin - I'd have to alter web-base-template to make "version" based sites then?
[11:38:04] <gnarf> cuz right now it only checks hostname i believe
[11:42:37] <nacin> gnarf: I'd make a few changes to support it, once you decide exactly what you want
[12:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: stage.blog.jqueryui.com runs on a separate WordPress install from the other stage sites, right?
[12:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't have web-base-template available to it, correct?
[12:18:13] <rworth> this makes me think of translated sites
[12:18:27] <rworth> we're likely going to have a similar concern, and maybe approach, yeah?
[12:18:40] <rworth> nacin thoughts?
[12:19:10] <rworth> and this might come up fairly soon. Korean translation work may start in earnest in Nov and Portuguese in Dec
[12:23:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: correct
[12:26:13] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to themeroller: http://git.io/HULsMg
[12:26:13] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/themeroller] Expose methods for generating themeroller.html in the site repo - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:26:45] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com] jzaefferer created themeroller (+1 new commit): http://git.io/P9mEaQ
[12:26:45] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/themeroller] Generate themeroller.html. Introduces an option to skip the prepare task, useful while testing - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:27:35] <jzaefferer> xavier_: updated both repos to generate themeroller.html in the site - kind of working, but there's issues. For example themeroller tries to load jQuery, jQuery UI and its own files, then the theme loads another jQuery version, overwriting the previous one. themeroller.js then fails due to the missing farbtastic plugin
[12:28:00] <jzaefferer> xavier_: there's also styling conflicts. And we should remove the Firefox Bookmarklet
[12:28:45] <jzaefferer> xavier_: the download button doesn't work, doesn't yet point to the right page. That should be trivial to fix
[12:44:44] <nacin> rworth: translated sites would probably be handled the same way - all depends on your URL structure
[12:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm having problems with release_themes.
[12:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> There are missing steps for setting up download.jqueryui.com.
[14:02:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: clone the download repo, `npm link` that, then `npm link download.jqueryui.com` inside the jqueryui.com repo
[14:02:16] <jzaefferer> that should be all that's necessary
[14:31:51] <xavier_> jzaefferer, farbtastic is embedded in the frontend js
[14:32:35] <xavier_> does it fail on client or building (deploying) server?
[14:36:32] <xavier_> jzaefferer, themeroller loads jquery, jQuery UI (base theme), then specific theme css's (like live does). Anything missing? Should I change it?
[14:39:02] <xavier_> jzaefferer, removing the head tag "New! Bring ThemeRoller into any page: Get the ThemeRoller Firefox Bookmarklet!"
[14:54:18] <jzaefferer> xavier_: it behaves different when embedded into wordpress
[14:54:25] <jzaefferer> that's what I was talking about
[14:54:35] <xavier_> ohoh
[14:55:03] <xavier_> what happens? (or I can investigate later)
[14:57:58] <xavier_> (my question was just if you had looked into it, dont need to if you're doing anything else ok)
