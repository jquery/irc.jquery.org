[05:35:22] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so my solution works for draggable except for the fact that you can't stop widget from cleaning data on remove elements, which includes the instance
[05:35:43] <mikesherov> so when you add plugins, and they access instance options, it's an error
[05:36:28] <mikesherov> and maybe this is going overboard, but is there a reason we don't pass the instance to all events? we currently pass event and a ui hash....
[06:06:20] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, pre-release and download packages have some differences https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5253603
[06:06:43] <rxaviers> some are expected, some I have questions inlined in the gist above
[06:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Because we don't want users interacting directly with the instance if they're using jQuery APIs.
[06:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4320574/why-is-jquerys-email-validation-regex-so-simple
[06:22:25] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so interactions are the last things that use the ui.plugin.call pattern
[06:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's deprecated.
[06:22:43] <mikesherov> right
[06:23:06] <mikesherov> I have two paths… 1. add this.options to the uiHash
[06:23:18] <mikesherov> 2. change the plugin calls to include the instance
[06:23:58] <mikesherov> That way, I can do ui.options in the plugins instead of $(this).draggable("instance").options
[06:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> You can't do ui.options.
[06:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> We've decided that years ago.
[06:25:02] <mikesherov> OK
[06:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to change how the plugins work internally, that's fine.
[06:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> And probably makes a lot more sense than how they're implemented now.
[06:26:10] <mikesherov> well, Dave_Stein already implemented them in the new way in the interactions branch
[06:26:34] <mikesherov> so really, I want to get to a place where I can get the test and feature working with the least impact elsewhere
[06:28:00] <mikesherov> does changing the plugin calls to include another undocumented parameter for the instance make sense?
[06:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, that whole API is undocumented.
[06:28:50] <mikesherov> ok, so rather than messing with the uiHash, I'll add another parameter to the plugin calls
[06:28:52] <mikesherov> Thanks again!

[07:49:34] <evenicoulddoit> Hi all. I'm trying to upgrade my projects jQuery and UI, and I'm running into snags with my tabs. I think it's because tabsTemplate has been removed from the API, but http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation suggests otherwise, should be removed
[08:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> evenicoulddoit: How does that demo suggest otherwise?
[08:07:47] <evenicoulddoit> scott_gonzalez: Oh... yeh completely my bad. I just spotted the var tabsTemplate and didn't notice it was just being used separately and not in the call to tabs
[08:09:00] <evenicoulddoit> But there _IS_ a bug with this example http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[08:09:12] <evenicoulddoit> Even though I know it says it's not supported and not a widget
[08:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's already fixed.
[08:09:39] <evenicoulddoit> Oh, and waiting to go out?
[08:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, demos only update with releases.
[08:10:06] <evenicoulddoit> Okay cool :) - thanks
[08:10:30] <evenicoulddoit> When's the next minor release?
[08:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> evenicoulddoit: We don't set dates for releases.
[08:13:00] <evenicoulddoit> OK thanks for your help

[09:28:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you think you'll be around tonight for pointer questions? if so, how late do you usually work?
[09:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not. My mom is visiting.
[09:31:06] <kborchers> ok, no prob … i'm used to just guessing what i think i should do then you tearing it apart the next day :)
[09:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> hahaha
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's like <base> :-P There's a spec that I get my answers from :-)
[09:32:45] <kborchers> yeah … i was thinking more specific questions about how we're implementing it
[09:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> Though the spec isn't going to tell you about special events.
[09:32:54] <kborchers> i had questions the other night but it was late and now i forget
[09:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> For that I just source dive in core :-(
[09:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Just ask the questions in IRC and I'll see them in the morning.
[09:33:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, that's basically what i've been doing :)
[09:35:02] <kborchers> i hate the week before a conference … too many things going on in my head at the same time
[09:35:24] <kborchers> especially when i'm still working on the demo for what i'm presenting and have 0 slides
[09:35:29] <kborchers> :)
[09:35:42] <kborchers> and it's a 1 hour slot :/
[09:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[09:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> 1 hour is a long presentation.
[09:49:53] <kborchers> yeah
[11:24:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Thank you for the event template :-)
[11:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You're welcome.
[11:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if you have any questions.
[11:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile has way more events than I thought :-P
[11:26:22] <agcolom> yes, will proabably do that after my holiday. I'm going on friday... for 2 weeks... I'll have no internet... 
[11:28:40] <agcolom> Although I might work on the button doc tonight... I need to do something that will make me feel good ;-) bad day at work.... disappointing meeting when we propose to build something useful and they say they'd prefer we did a study of existing tools rather then build the tool we all need!
[11:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:30:03] <agcolom> and didn't have time to do some shopping on my way back, so I think it will be the docs instead ;-) (and I'm making chips for dinner (you call them fries? )
[11:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, fries.
[11:58:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, quick question, do you need `release_themes` task explicitly? It's only used inside `release_cdn`. Do you run it manually or in anywhere else?
[11:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Nope, we never run it directly.
[11:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> Just as a step inside release_cdn.
[11:59:40] <rxaviers> k thks
[12:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> It used to be impossible to do the whole release as one step before.
[12:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> And the theme generation had to be done as its own step.
[12:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> It was super ghetto.
[12:00:42] <scott_gonzalez> And took like 15 minutes.
[12:07:52] <rxaviers> ;) ok
[12:07:59] <rxaviers> by the way
[12:08:02] <rxaviers> > In jQuery UI 1.9.2 works perfectly. Why?

[12:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hey mgifford.
[12:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> #jquery is for general support for all projects, so it can be tough to hold a conversation in there.
[12:53:53] <mgifford> Fine to discuss things here.. I've got too many channels of communication open most days.
[12:54:12] <mgifford> Totally. I just wanted to ensure I reached out on the right server.
[12:55:16] <mgifford> So, from twitter https://twitter.com/mgifford/status/316995397329494016
[12:55:17] <b-ot> mgifford: @mgifford: @scott_gonzalez On a different note, looking at http://t.co/fLompkyOHV & _focusTabbable: function I'd like to know if there's more docs
[12:56:23] <mgifford> If we're trying to replicate and standardize the tab order there's no background documentation or issue queue thread on how it got there?
[12:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't actually deal with tab order.
[12:56:59] <mgifford> Jesse Beach in particular would probably be very interested in your ideas for taking it further.  If there's a common approach.
[12:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> We just assume that DOM order is tab order.
[12:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> For the focus wrapping anyway.
[12:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> We just hope that the first and last focusable element are actually the first and last in tab order.
[12:58:14] <mgifford> This is the stuff here she was looking at:
[12:58:16] <mgifford>        // Set focus to the first match:
[12:58:17] <mgifford>         // 1. First element inside the dialog matching [autofocus]
[12:58:19] <mgifford>         // 2. Tabbable element inside the content element
[12:58:20] <mgifford>         // 3. Tabbable element inside the buttonpane
[12:58:22] <mgifford>         // 4. The close button
[12:58:23] <mgifford>         // 5. The dialog itself
[12:58:32] <mgifford> Sorry, bad for to post multi-line code.
[12:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so that's what we use to set focus on open.
[12:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> Or if we notice that focus somehow moved outside of the dialog.
[13:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> There are two things we're considering
[13:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> 1) If we find an element that would cause the dialog content to scroll, don't use that element.
[13:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> Instead we would focus the dialog itself
[13:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Track the focused element inside the dialog so if focus moves out somehow, then we can restore focus to the previously focused element
[13:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> Instead of using the _focusTabbable() logic again.
[13:04:36] <mgifford> this is useful. I've passed this along.
[13:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> We have this ticket to track the changes: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6006
[13:05:36] <mgifford> Hopefully we'll be in touch as we keep moving this issue along http://drupal.org/node/1913086
[13:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> I also want to resolve the differences between how ARIA and HTML5 say to manage focus for dialogs.
[13:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> I plan on opening a discussion between WAI PF and WHATWG about that soon.
[13:07:02] <mgifford> that sounds great.  If there's any way we can help with that, do let me know.
[13:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa. That script actually kills the tabindex on other elements, huh?
[13:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that's one way to not have to worry about whether DOM order matches tab order.
[13:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it could be slow on a large DOM though.
[13:11:26] <mgifford> glad we could get some more eyes looking over it. Setting the tabindex can be quite important.
[13:13:37] <jbeach> hi scott_gonzalez, everyone's been telling me I need to chat with you :)
[13:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> jbeach: About what?
[13:14:38] <jbeach> we're trying to find a sane way to constrain tabbing scope for Drupal
[13:14:38] <jbeach> http://drupal.org/node/1913086
[13:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:15:08] <jbeach> I'm been going through the jQuery 1.10 dialog approach, looking for inspiration
[13:15:16] <jbeach> you laugh, I understand why
[13:15:36] <jbeach> I heard you're having thing discussion at a higher level?
[13:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> Where is this discussion happening?
[13:15:41] <jbeach> http://drupal.org/node/1913086
[13:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, yes, but clearly you and mgifford (and others)? were chatting about this.
[13:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> Like, just now.
[13:16:06] <jbeach> yes
[13:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> But not in that issue and not in #drupal-contribute
[13:16:31] <jbeach> they a11y folks have a Skype channel they like to use
[13:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[13:17:13] <jbeach> anyways, I don't have anything specific to say now. Just wanted to say hi
[13:17:22] <jbeach> Since your name keeps coming up
[13:17:41] <scott_gonzalez> So, we've come to the conclusion in jQuery UI that trying to actually force modal behavior is more trouble than its worth.
[13:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> So we simplified this quite a bit in 1.10.
[13:18:13] <jbeach> I concluded the same thing
[13:18:22] <jbeach> in your case, you at least have a wrapper to delegate from
[13:18:32] <jbeach> a context to search in
[13:18:47] <jbeach> using the document as a context is difficult
[13:18:55] <jbeach> as you implied
[13:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, wouldn't you always have some container?
[13:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is kinda big, but this covers the change in logic: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/3829a37ca122e923c3a08b964c4b1a946a2a1456
[13:19:36] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Nate Eagle (5mon 1w ago): Dialog: Awesome new stacking and overlay implementation. Fixes the following tickets:  Fixes #3534 - Dialog: Modal dialog disables all input elements on page. Fixes #4671 - Dialog: Modal Dialog disables vertical scroll bar in Chrome & Safari. Fixes #4995 - Dialog: Modal Dialog's overlay dissapears in IE when content is tall. Fixes #5388 - Dialog: Don't change z-index when already at the top. Fixes #5466 - Dialog: "m
[13:19:37] <jbeach> In one case, we have links scattered across the page
[13:19:50] <jbeach> select boxes for contextual actions
[13:19:58] <jbeach> the related to content items
[13:20:25] <jbeach> I like how the jQuery Dialogs "catch" the tabbing
[13:20:30] <jbeach> and keep it once they've got it
[13:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so I was telling mgifford we cheat a bit with that.
[13:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> We assume that DOM order matches tab order.
[13:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> And trap based on the first and last tabbable element in the dialog.
[13:21:08] <jbeach> rather than taking tabindex into account, ya
[13:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, customized tabindex makes pretty much everything painful.
[13:21:49] <jbeach> good to know I'm not the only one running into this pain!
[13:22:02] <jbeach> I feel like I've taken at least 3 false starts in this effort
[13:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> We've got this ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7791
[13:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if we'll ever handle that.
[13:23:34] <jbeach> are you talking with folks up the food chain about this?
[13:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> I don't recall if I did or not.
[13:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, everyone I've ever talked to about roaming tabindex just does 0 and -1
[13:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> I can bring it up with WAI PF.
[13:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> See if they have any comments about it.
[13:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> I also plan on bringing this to WAI PF.
[13:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6006
[13:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's really annoying that ARIA and HTML5 have different rules for what should be focused when you open a dialog.
[13:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> So we want to push for them to sync up.
[13:29:39] <jbeach> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the pointer. 
[13:30:47] <mgifford> Yes, if there's any way we can be involved to get them to use the same rules that would be nice.
[13:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> mgifford: I'll include you in the email.
[13:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> When I finally get around to sending it out.
[14:24:19] <mgifford> scott_gonzalez - Thanks
