[02:31:44] <Changsuk> gabriel_schulhof: Hi~~
[02:51:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Changsuk: What's up?
[03:01:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: meeting today?
[03:06:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No.
[03:07:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We're moving it to Friday.
[03:07:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean Thursday.
[03:08:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Did you have anything for us?
[03:08:54] <arschmitz> yes
[03:08:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[03:09:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll let them know.
[03:09:15] <arschmitz> ok
[03:23:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is it just me or is irc.jquery.org not working?
[03:24:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm getting "Connecting..."
[03:26:01] <gabriel_schulhof> events.jquery.org is OK, but jquery.org is not, and neither is irc.jquery.org
[03:29:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah something is up
[03:30:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh jq01 is down
[03:30:34] <arschmitz> all the wordpress sites
[03:30:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Indeed!
[03:33:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i texted all the infra guys
[03:33:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Which coast are they on?
[03:34:05] <arschmitz> one is in boston 2 are on west coast
[03:35:14] <gabriel_schulhof> That's great!
[03:56:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think I figured out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7177 BTW: The key is that in path.squash(), when getDocumentUrl() returns a URL of the form /path1/#path2/, you first recurse by calling path.squash() on the document URL, and use the result as the resolution URL for the URL you're being asked to squash.
[05:25:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Can you also weigh in on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9960
[05:26:07] <mikesherov> Dave and I weren't sure if we should register a scroll listener.
[05:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: done
[05:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Regarding the offsetFractions test for position, before I left for vacation, I was wondering if we could just drop the whole thing and never round.
[05:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't get a chance to check all browsers though.

[06:26:05] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: Ping!
[06:26:19] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: pong
[06:26:36] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i figured out whats up with http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10544
[06:26:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: had asked me about it earlier
[06:27:33] <tj_vantoll> Awesome. Now I'm curious :)
[06:27:50] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: its an issue in menu because menufocus happens on both hover and click
[06:27:56] <arschmitz> which happen at same time on ios
[06:28:26] <arschmitz> so the parent item gets focus menu opens first child gets focus the click happens and focus goes back to the parent
[06:29:06] <tj_vantoll> I'm not completely following.
[06:29:25] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i need to look for the ticket i swear i opened on in austin on this because jorn and i looked at it because i found it porting to mobile
[06:30:06] <tj_vantoll> So what does Chrome for Android do with hover that it doesn't have this issue?
[06:33:26] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: android does not handle hover really
[06:35:19] <arschmitz> well it does im sorry but totally different
[06:35:31] <arschmitz> its not as sticky
[06:35:39] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/xavefi/1/edit
[06:35:51] <arschmitz> on ios if you tap the button it turns red and stays that way
[06:35:58] <arschmitz> nothing you can do
[06:36:14] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: on android you tap it it turns red but you tap else where and it reverts
[06:37:12] <tj_vantoll> huh
[06:37:16] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: hmm i think im wrong about that being the issue though
[06:37:48] <arschmitz> because ios does not seem to deal with the event only the style
[06:38:30] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: so never mind ill go back to debugging 
[06:39:22] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm curious so I might poke at this too. I wonder if you get to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/menu.js#L80
[06:39:35] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: its menu focus bounce for sure
[06:39:43] <arschmitz> im just need to find the issue
[06:39:56] <tj_vantoll> Ok
[06:40:06] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: if you log menu focus 
[06:40:15] <arschmitz> you always get two when you click on ios
[06:40:44] <arschmitz> which you do on desktop kinda because you get one when you hover then one when you click
[06:44:22] <arschmitz> but mousenter is not a thing on ios lol 
[06:49:53] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: thats exactly what it is
[06:50:09] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: re I wonder if you get to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/menu.js#L80
[06:50:16] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/itixun/14/edit

[11:09:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: this is a fun one: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7778
[11:10:14] <mikesherov> apparently, old IE fires mousemove if you put content under the mouse programatically. So on mousedown, a mouse move is fired without event.button and event.which
[11:10:24] <mikesherov> which triggers some badness in mouse.js
[11:10:46] <mikesherov> ```
[11:10:50] <mikesherov> _mouseMove: function(event) {
[11:10:51] <mikesherov> 		// IE mouseup check - mouseup happened when mouse was out of window
[11:10:53] <mikesherov> 		if ($.ui.ie && ( !document.documentMode || document.documentMode < 9 ) && !event.button) {
[11:10:54] <mikesherov> 			return this._mouseUp(event);
[11:10:55] <mikesherov> 		// Iframe mouseup check - mouseup occurred in another document
[11:10:56] <mikesherov> 		}
[11:11:01] <mikesherov> so mouse up is triggered right away
[11:11:04] <mikesherov> FUN
[11:11:10] <mikesherov> fixing now
[11:23:37] <kborchers> ?paste @ mikesherov 
[11:23:37] <b-ot> mikesherov: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:23:39] <kborchers> :P
[11:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yeah, IE has sane behavior actually.
[11:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to get this behavior standardized. It didn't go anywhere.
[11:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> Check out http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html
[11:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> That says Firefox only, let me dig up the conversation I had with Microsoft.
[11:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I talked to Microsoft because Jacob Rossi is an editor for DOM Events.
[11:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently WebKit fires phantom mousemove events if the page can scroll.
[11:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> "There’s an additional quirk here. When the page can scroll, WebKit fires phantom mousemove events periodically when the mouse is stationary, which makes it pick up layout changes eventually. Try the test page with it resized so it scrolls in Chrome and you’ll see the mouseover fire after a short delay."
[11:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see that behavior in Chrome, so maybe they removed it from Blink.
[11:34:00] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so there's no good way I can see to detect the difference between mouse up having happened outside the document vs. mousemove fired on replaced content
[11:34:16] <mikesherov> kborchers: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7778
[11:44:39] <mikesherov> I think I got it
[12:11:22] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: please check: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1318

[12:13:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to land this as well now that we've discussed it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1313
[12:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[12:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Was this accidentally included? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1313/files#diff-0
[12:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> I started commented on it, then saw that it was a JS Bin and then saw that it was in a random location.
[12:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1318 in Firefox?

[12:25:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, accidental
[12:25:18] <mikesherov> I removed it
[12:25:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: re 1318, not yet
[12:25:39] <mikesherov> I wanna get your feedback first
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> fix seems fine
[12:25:57] <mikesherov> and then I'll test and see if I can even create a unit test, as I'd like this not to regress
[12:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> I just expect the visual test to fail in Firefox.
[12:26:27] <mikesherov> OK, will double check
[13:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> :sigh: Microsoft writes a blog post about 1.11.0 AFTER we released 1.11.1...
[13:21:09] <scott_gonzalez> It actually took them this long to update their CDN.
