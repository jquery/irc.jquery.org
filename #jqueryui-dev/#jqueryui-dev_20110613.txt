[05:47:18] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Datepicker: Don't use .delegate(). Fixes #7470 - Datepicker: 1.8.x can't be used with jQuery 1.3.2 due to use of .delegate(). - Scott Gonz√°lez
[06:34:28] <gnarf> hey kborchers
[06:34:58] <gnarf> lookin at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/353 -- couple of ideas
[06:36:07] <kborchers> ok, what were you thinking
[06:38:06] <gnarf> a) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/353/files#L0R1556
[06:38:41] <gnarf> this diff seems to throw out that whole "numMonths" ternary
[06:39:27] <gnarf> also
[06:39:31] <gnarf> seeing that
[06:39:43] <gnarf> made me think... shouldn't that "max" technically be "per row"
[06:39:45] <gnarf> ?
[06:40:02] <gnarf> but not sure if its worth the effort
[06:41:54] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure what you mean by "per row".
[06:42:11] <gnarf> you can have a datepicker that has 2 rows of 2 months each
[06:44:34] <kborchers> ahhh, i see. forgot about that. that is where the ui-datepicker-row-break comes in. which i removed with that pull. Might be necessary to do per row since there is no break on multi-row datepickers in that solution but if you leave it in, IE adds an extra row every time for some reason.
[06:44:37] <gnarf> kborchers: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/datepicker/multimonth.html
[06:46:17] <kborchers> unless we're ok with not having that row break. i also see your point though on whether or not the per row is worth the effort
[06:47:01] <kborchers> wonder if http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/datepicker/multimonth.html would look funny with different sized rows
[06:47:15] <gnarf> kborchers: doubt we're ok with dropping a documented feature http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-numberOfMonths
[06:47:52] <gnarf> (at least until we drop it ;) )
[06:48:14] <gnarf> not the type of fix that datepicker needs right now
[06:48:29] <kborchers> not suggesting dropping array of months, just the extra break added between rows
[06:49:02] <gnarf> that makes the array of months look like rows/columns right?
[06:49:17] <gnarf> go look at that on your branch
[06:50:34] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/1w0o1D0X0Q1Q12343P2S
[06:51:49] <kborchers> ouch
[06:52:15] <gnarf> kborchers: stop deleting lines of code without understanding what they are doing ;)
[06:52:28] <gnarf> (i happen to do it myself sometimes too, don't worry)
[06:53:30] <kborchers> yeah, get a little hacky when trying to fix IE stuff and should probably be a little more careful
[06:53:53] <kborchers> i will play with that solution some more, reverse that second commit and try to go per row
[06:54:26] <gnarf> no need to "reverse" just checkout 1d984e76b79bfeda15eff392e06d8ed0eab72333 ;)
[06:54:56] <kborchers> right
[06:55:01] <gnarf> looks better there
[07:15:22] <kborchers> gnarf: setting per row seems pretty easy actually, just reset this.maxRows in the row loop. now just have to figure out why IE adds an extra row every time in all versions and other browsers do not
[07:15:56] <gnarf> kborchers: now, the question becomes - what happens if the first month in the row has 4, but the second has 5, and third has 4 ?
[07:16:14] <gnarf> if you are doing a per row loop, if the early month has extra its missing its space right?
[07:23:43] <kborchers> no, seems fine. i'm calculating this.maxRows in the month loop but then resetting in row loop and seems ok. still learning ins and outs of git so not sure if this is right but checked out 1d984e76b79bfeda15eff392e06d8ed0eab72333 and then commited to a new branch in my repo https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/a7997920d3d6fa5896377791a49917cb76be3ad2.
[07:25:45] <gnarf> hrm
[07:42:06] <gnarf> kborchers: you coulda used the old branch, that way it stays in the same pull request
[07:43:10] <gnarf> grrr
[07:43:19] <gnarf> its really damn hard to test effects
[07:45:02] <kborchers> gnarf: i'll try to redo it in the same branch (was a simple change so not a big deal). was having trouble with it keeping the commit i was trying to get rid of. like i said, still learning git. heading to a meeting at 10, hopefully back by 11 CST.
[07:47:30] <gnarf> push -f (to force)
[07:47:42] <gnarf> it "rewrites history"
[07:48:01] <gnarf> but since you aren't dealing with "master" you can get away with that
[07:48:44] <kborchers> i think the issue was actually on my checkout. I wasn't throwing away changes so it kept that commit. I think i got it now. just a sec
[07:50:08] <gnarf> you can use rebase to delete a commit
[07:55:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/m7UnOp
[07:55:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion tests: Don't use deprecated assertion methods. - Scott Gonz√°lez
[07:58:28] <kborchers> gnarf: still something screwy, not letting me force. i'll try after my meeting.
[07:59:59] <gnarf> hrm
[08:00:07] <gnarf> those irc commits look a little cleaner
[08:00:31] <gnarf> are we doing a docs meet today?
[08:57:14] <kborchers> gnarf: ok, this should be better and in the current pull. https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/ed7802090fc6ec8109d69c91a42 5adfffb8cff39 Still have to figure out the extra row in IE though
[08:58:36] <kborchers> gnarf: sory about the link https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/ed7802090fc6ec8109d69c91a425adfffb8cff39
[09:10:16] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/5995175065131d1bec19845a7063de91527d664c  -- that visual tester page is badass
[10:07:23] <kborchers> gnarf: figured out the "extra row" issue in IE. It was the height of ui-datepicker-row-break being thrown off by the font-size inherited from ui-widget. I think this pull should be complete now. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/353
[11:10:05] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/mAwn2L
[11:10:05] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Autocomplete tests: Cleanup. - Scott Gonz√°lez
[11:13:43] <gnarf> hrm
[11:13:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you review a branch for me?
[11:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:14:08] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/compare/scale-tests
[11:14:24] <gnarf> based most of that off of http://jqbug.com/ui/p308
[11:14:55] <gnarf> i just wanted a second set of eyes on it
[11:15:21] <gnarf> and i know - its annoying effects stuff
[11:17:38] <gnarf> so far, -- IE6 has some issues
[11:17:54] <gnarf> but everything else seems to be passing
[11:18:16] <gnarf> but ie6 has some serious issues with positioning :)
[11:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> this file should be outdented: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/blob/07e4f4429205db0b88c736cad5c0cce8fee2c84b/tests/unit/effects/effects_scale.js
[11:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> we don't indent for the main closure, since it's the entire file
[11:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> can you refactor the test so that you call asyncTest multiple times, instead of one test for everything?
[11:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> that should also remove the need to call QUnit.reset()
[11:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> other than that, it looks good
[11:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> should you run it with position: "static" as well?
[11:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> oh, since this is a new file, you'll need to do some cleanup: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/blob/07e4f4429205db0b88c736cad5c0cce8fee2c84b/tests/visual/effects/effects.scale.html
[11:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> lowercase doctype and utf-8
[11:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> no XML
[11:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> no type attributes
[11:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> no media on style
[11:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> outdent the CSS to line up with the tag
[11:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> no charset on script (line 87)
[11:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> outdent the script to line up with the tag
[11:24:07] <gnarf> position "static" doesn't have "left" / "right" issues
[11:24:24] <gnarf> it just stores the position that the wrapper element ended at
[11:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> and move the script from line 87 into the head and use $(function() {}) for the main closure
[11:32:29] <rworth> cleaning up jquery-global, I want to remove the support for using it without jQuery. This is currently done by building in a handful of utility functions copied from jQuery core which are then used internally.
[11:32:31] <rworth> Of course this means 95% of users of the plugin carry that extra code weight as well as whoever is maintaining it needs to keep them in sync and make sure nothing on the $ is ever called but them. yuk
[11:33:09] <rworth> if this is really important to someone, they could do it on their own. Can I get a +1 ?
[11:34:27] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: gnarf: ^^
[11:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> -1
[11:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> what is it using?
[11:37:06] <rworth> extend, trim, isArray, isString, isObject
[11:37:19] <rworth> extend is the biggest, as well as the most significant
[11:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> isString?
[11:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> what type of extending does it do?
[11:37:47] <rworth> it extends culture objects
[11:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, complex deep extending
[11:38:07] <rworth> most cultures inherit from english, so you don't have to repeat things they have in common
[11:38:09] <rworth> yes
[11:38:51] <rworth> plus I'm concerned about circular references, does $.extend handle those? May have to test
[11:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it does
[11:39:06] <rworth> thanks
[11:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> is it always extend( true, {}, obj1, obj2 ) ?
[11:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> we could probably write a much smaller extend implementation
[11:40:55] <rworth> hmm, seems it hasn't copied trim and isObject from jQuery, I assumed it did
[11:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> the files aren't even using the proper extend: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global/blob/master/globinfo/Globalization.af.js#L5
[11:41:38] <rworth> well, so I have that fixed but not yet committed
[11:41:54] <rworth> that's part of how I realized this was an issue
[11:41:59] <rworth> it obviously isn't tested
[11:42:10] <rworth> and if it is to be, it means two sep. test suites
[11:42:56] <rworth> I'd feel a lot better about it, if we were to support both fully if it was developed and maintained as a generaly purpose JavaScript globalization plugin which we then wrapped in a jQuery plugin
[11:43:07] <rworth> rather than the other way around
[11:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> has anyone talked to any other JS libs about sharing code?
[11:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> that's what it's supposed to be
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> MS wrote is as a jQuery plugin and the first thing we said was "don't do that"
[11:44:28] <rworth> agreed, and I was part of that community given that exact feedback
[11:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> so why are you asking for the opposite right now?
[11:45:08] <rworth> problem is, their fix seems to have been "you can provide your own thing called Globalization/jQuery/$ and we'll assume it has a few things on it"
[11:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> we need to fix that
[11:45:32] <rworth> because it exists today as a jQuery plugin and I'm trying clean it up
[11:45:36] <rworth> ok, we can do that
[11:45:49] <rworth> it means a bit more work, but I agree it's the right thing
[11:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:51:29] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/j1T1Km
[11:51:29] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion tests: Cleanup. - Scott Gonz√°lez
[11:54:32] <rworth> http://github.com/jquery/globaljs ?
[11:54:40] <rworth> global alone seems not quite enough
[11:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> we can figure out a name later
[11:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> no need to rename the repo right now
[11:55:57] <rworth> well it's not renaming that repo, because there would be two
[11:56:25] <rworth> one would be not jQuery specific (like QUnit) and the other, if it exists would be the existing jquery-global which wraps that as a jQuery plugin
[11:56:36] <rworth> or that just exists as a utility in the UI repo
[11:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I don't know that we'll have a jquery-global repo
[11:57:15] <rworth> yeah
[11:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> all of the work should continue in the existing repo
[11:57:50] <gnarf> this is really f'ed up
[11:57:56] <rworth> :)
[11:57:59] <gnarf> ie7 is failing some of those tests....
[11:58:11] <gnarf> but the visual page looks perfect
[11:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> failing by a lot?
[11:58:44] <gnarf> nah, 2 cases
[11:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> I mean the pixel values
[11:58:55] <gnarf> position relative : bottom/right
[11:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> oh...hmm...
[11:59:19] <gnarf> strange thing , only the "right" value differs
[11:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> maybe padding or something on the containing element?
[11:59:41] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/3N2g190o0B1U1q1r0m3A
[12:00:16] <gnarf> its off by 25 in the middle and 50 at the end
[12:00:24] <gnarf> 50 happens to be the width of the element
[12:01:12] <gnarf> (pre scale)
[12:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: do you recall a bug with relative positioning in IE 7 and some dimensiony thing being wrong?
[12:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> or was that something like margins in Firefox?
[12:05:59] <gnarf> heh
[12:06:10] <gnarf> its only the horizontal test and that fucks with me
[12:06:22] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: whether or not we rename the repo now we need a new name, as even in the same repo the files all needs names, and I'd rather come up with the right name now and move one. I'm thinking globalize.js
[12:07:04] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: there was a weird webkit bug with right margin I fixed in core recently
[12:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> that's what I'm thinking of
[12:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> obviously not related :-/
[12:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> how about blitzk√§fig
[12:09:21] <rworth> so I could create a new folder in the existing repo called globalize and it would have all the core pure-js files, then the rest of the repo can be the jquery-global plugin. Then at some point in the future we could maybe rename the repo and have it just be that folder, the plugin could become a UI utility
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> bastardized German translation of flash cage
[12:09:31] <rworth> haha
[12:09:49] <rworth> or just flashcage
[12:09:57] <rworth> and each culture file is it translated
[12:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[12:10:06] <rworth> so not flashcage.de-DE.js
[12:10:17] <rworth> but blitzk√§fig.js
[12:10:31] <rworth> unicode WIN
[12:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> haha :-)
[12:10:40] <rworth> that would be the coolest looking folder with 350 files
[12:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> you'll need a gettext implementation just to load the right files :-P
[12:11:12] <rworth> haha
[12:12:06] <rpflo> MAMP's got a bunch of readme's named with unicode, 350 would be mind blowing :D
[12:12:15] <rworth> ok, so sub-folder called globalize that has potential for being upgraded to be the repo on its own in the future?
[12:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[12:12:27] <rworth> thanks
[12:16:38] <rpflo> what's globalize? languages?
[12:17:03] <rworth> rpflo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global
[12:17:19] <rworth> handles dates numbers and currency as well as custom localization
[12:18:36] <rpflo> why not name it localize, or some other form of local (if you're naming it now) Most stuff I"m familiar with uses "local"
[12:21:06] * kborchers[A] is now away - Reason : In a meeting - back around 3:30 CST
[12:24:41] <rworth> rpflo: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalisation_and_localisation paragraphs 3-4
[12:25:47] <rpflo> Good 'nuff :)  the term "global" is just a little loaded in JS, but yeah, globalization seems as appropriate as localization.
[12:26:16] <rworth> yeah, that's why I switched from global to globalize
[13:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> wontfix? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7472
[13:26:17] <rpflo> yeah, accessibility doesn't require assigning keyboard shortcuts
[13:31:00] <toddparker> hey guys - i was just doing some initial sketches for the mobile TR tool because Adobe said they might have an intern available to work on this
[13:31:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Mobile-ThemeRoller
[13:31:27] <toddparker> One idea I had was to try and make this as lightweight as possible and just build it in JS
[13:31:37] <toddparker> so people can tweak the tool and embed it in their apps too
[13:32:12] <toddparker> we're not generating colored icons for mobile - you get black or white so server-side isn't as crucial
[13:32:55] <toddparker> we have a ton more levers in mobile, but a similar tool could be used with UI
[13:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'd be interesting to build it as a standard form that submits to a server, then intercept the submit and generate the theme in JS
[13:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> that way it's easy to have it hit a server and generate colored icons if you want
[13:56:09] <rworth> I think it'd be interesting to start at the command line
[13:56:26] <rworth> and then have a web form call that on the server
[14:11:52] <ioannis> Hi, how can I not to display the little x button on the title bar of jquery ui dialog?
[14:12:01] <rworth> hide it with css
[14:13:20] <ioannis> thats no good, there should be an option where i want to use it or not
[14:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> how is that better than CSS?
[14:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> and why are you hiding it?
[14:15:21] <ioannis> because i want the user to be able to close it when i want
[14:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can only assume that's for some validation reason
[14:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> in which case you should use the beforeClose callback
[14:19:03] <rworth> there's a demo of this on jqueryui.com
[14:19:29] <ioannis> yes but the validation takes lots of seconds
[14:19:34] <ioannis> i am looking at it
[15:46:43] <gnarf> hrm
[15:46:55] <gnarf> outerWidth seems maybe broken?
[15:49:10] <gnarf> i'm getting 20 back from outerWidth
[15:49:14] <gnarf> and 50 back from width()
[16:07:29] <gnarf> is it maybe something about running in the qunit environment that is stopping it from getting offsetWidth of a not on screen element or something?
[16:12:03] <gnarf> yeah
[16:12:14] <gnarf> the .offsetWidth is 20 --- .css("width") is 50
[16:30:24] <gnarf> I'm not sure what, but this seems to be a qunit specific bug
[16:36:11] <gnarf> hrm
[16:36:15] <gnarf> run this in IE 7 http://jsfiddle.net/HJ4ak/1/
[16:40:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: so yeah qunit bug!
[16:49:32] <gnarf> #qunit-fixture needed a width / height --- because it wasn't defined it seemed to be shrinkwrapping the boxes
[16:49:56] <gnarf> compare http://jsfiddle.net/HJ4ak/2/ to http://jsfiddle.net/HJ4ak/1/
[16:50:17] <ryanneufeld> Where is the appropriate place to report bugs for jquery Ui 1.9?
[16:52:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: trac
[16:52:07] <gnarf> or here
[16:52:27] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: trac has versions for 1.9m releases and also has "git" so you can file bugs against "unreleased" versions
[16:53:10] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7264 I filed that a while ago, (just checked up on it now)
[16:53:17] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/114 thats 4 hours of my life i want back
[16:53:23] <gnarf> ^^^ scott_gonzalez / jzaefferer
[16:53:32] <ryanneufeld> so I'm just making sure that if I file a bug it's in the right place.
[16:53:57] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: is it still reproducable?
[16:54:15] <ryanneufeld> yes, and even worse, it's gives off by twos
[16:54:40] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/m57gP/29/
[16:54:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: here is a jQuery-ui GIT version fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rse9K/
[16:55:14] <adoven_> ryanneufeld: scott put a comment with your bug on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138077/Spinner#comment1303701545
[16:55:14] <ryanneufeld> that's what I'm running
[16:55:21] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: coo
[16:55:32] <gnarf> adoven_: yeah - we also opened up trac to allow these
[16:55:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ajpiano had me using that one for testing
[16:55:38] <gnarf> I'll triage it :)
[16:55:41] <adoven_> ok
[16:56:07] <gnarf> actually
[16:56:16] <gnarf> that component isn't even on trac yet
[16:56:17] <gnarf> :)
[16:56:23] <ryanneufeld> Thanks, I was hoping it wouldn't get missed. I'll take a look at the code and see if I can figure out how to fix it. Maybe I even make a pull request (if I can figure that out)
[16:56:25] <gnarf> so i'm gonna leave it invalid
[16:56:30] <ryanneufeld> pshh
[16:56:34] <gnarf> for now
[16:56:39] <ryanneufeld> lol
[16:56:40] <ryanneufeld> k
[16:56:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: bring it up in meeting on wednesday if I forget?
[16:56:59] <ryanneufeld> I'll try
[16:57:07] <ryanneufeld> I can't write to the meeting
[16:57:52] <ryanneufeld> I'm still fairly new to IRC as well, so I could be failing " Error(404): #jquery-meeting Cannot send to channel"
[16:58:17] <gnarf> its moderated when there isn't a meeting
[16:59:07] <ryanneufeld> oic
[16:59:46] <gnarf> but yeah
[16:59:48] <gnarf> go for the patch
[16:59:53] <gnarf> worst case we don't pull it
[16:59:58] <gnarf> just ref the "invalid" ticket :)
[17:00:07] <gnarf> but we probably will
[17:00:45] <adoven_> ryanneufeld: see here for commit styling http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/25941597/Commit-Message-Style-Guide
[17:01:11] <ryanneufeld> Thanks!
[17:01:12] <adoven_> also, i'd recommend creating a new branch in your repo while working on bugs (e.g. git checkout -b ticket-7230 )
[17:01:20] <gnarf> adoven_: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding-standards
[17:01:22] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding-standards
[17:01:23] <adoven_> makes dealing with pull requests easier for the pullers
[17:01:48] <ryanneufeld> not that familiar with the git yet
[17:01:52] <ryanneufeld> I'm more of a SVN guy
[17:02:03] <ryanneufeld> so I've forked the file
[17:02:05] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide
[17:02:11] <ryanneufeld> gonna take a look
[17:02:28] <ryanneufeld> thanks bot-t
[17:02:28] * bot-t sighs

[17:03:03] <bot-t> gnarf, #7808 (META: Investigate Event Object Creation) ñ jQuery Core ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7808
[17:03:59] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez I think I'm gonna merge that branch in now, wanna take one last look: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/compare/scale-tests
[17:06:30] <ryanneufeld> can you drop a fork?
[17:07:13] <gnarf> um
[17:07:15] <gnarf> delete the repo
[17:07:21] <gnarf> if you mean delete a branch
[17:07:23] <gnarf> git branch -d
[17:07:29] <gnarf> or git branch -D to FORCE it
[17:07:40] <gnarf> or git push origin :branch to delete a remote branch
[17:07:45] <ryanneufeld> k
[17:07:45] <ryanneufeld> thx
[17:23:57] <ryanneufeld> Fixed that bug :p
[17:34:50] <ryanneufeld> woot, my first pull request https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/364
[17:40:16] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: check github :)
[17:41:30] <ryanneufeld> I see your comments
[17:41:37] <ryanneufeld> I can't figure out what to do with them though?
[17:41:51] <ryanneufeld> I can't seem to edit my commit, so do I just do another one?
[17:42:25] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: okay
[17:42:29] <gnarf> so you can ammend the commit
[17:42:49] <gnarf> its not "best practice" but for pull requests its pretty easy
[17:42:51] <ryanneufeld> do I have to close the pull request?
[17:42:54] <gnarf> no
[17:42:59] <gnarf> you pulled from a branch right?
[17:43:04] <gnarf> the pull request follows that branch
[17:43:08] <ryanneufeld> oic
[17:43:22] <gnarf> did you already commit it to your local?
[17:43:34] <ryanneufeld> I did it all through github
[17:43:40] <ryanneufeld> I don't have a local copy
[17:43:44] <gnarf> oh - dude, you gotta clone it ;)
[17:44:02] <ryanneufeld> I forked it
[17:44:06] <ryanneufeld> doesn't that count?
[17:45:12] <ryanneufeld> okay, so I'm cloning to my local machine
[17:46:14] <gnarf> cool
[17:46:46] <gnarf> so you have two commits on a branch that reflect a single commit you want right?
[17:47:50] <ryanneufeld> sure
[17:47:55] <ryanneufeld> ;s
[17:48:06] <ryanneufeld> s/;/:
[17:48:29] <ryanneufeld> so when I cloned my forked repo
[17:48:39] <ryanneufeld> it didn' have the changes I made in the pull request
[17:49:06] <gnarf> make them again
[17:49:09] <gnarf> and git commit --amend
[17:49:16] <ryanneufeld> okay
[17:49:56] <gnarf> then git push -f origin patch-1
[17:50:56] <ryanneufeld> wtf, it's saying I modified files I haven't
[17:51:50] <ryanneufeld> error: src refspec patch-1 does not match any.
[17:51:50] <ryanneufeld> error: failed to push some refs to 'https://beatryder@github.com/beatryder/jquery-ui.git'
[17:52:20] <gnarf> okay sry, this is like yer first git use right?
[17:52:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah, pretty much
[17:52:31] <gnarf> moving into PMs to not spam everyone
[17:52:35] <ryanneufeld> k
[17:55:47] <hartfordcyclist> hey J√∂rn - wanted to ask about grid.js
[17:56:31] <hartfordcyclist> love the project, I've been pushing tmpl in asp.net mvc3 projects lately
[17:56:44] <hartfordcyclist> developers want grid, and i want to get them away from telerik
[17:57:11] <hartfordcyclist> be back in 10mins
[18:12:03] <hartfordcyclist> ok so, im looking at combining a few of the examples, sorting, paging, selectable along with the datasource and push for our salesforce.com developers to use it as their grid
[18:12:30] <hartfordcyclist> salesforce has a good javascript api that lets you query objects, and enforces security, so it seems like a good combinations
[18:12:40] <gnarf> hartfordcyclist: you might want to post something on the forums about it i don't think jzaefferer is actually around
[18:12:42] <hartfordcyclist> but i'm a little concerned over how soon to push that pattern
[18:13:11] <gnarf> this channel is usually pretty quiet in this time bracket
[18:13:30] <hartfordcyclist> ok thanks gnarf maybe i'll check back later - he tweeted the channel about half an hour before i came on, wasnt sure :)
[18:17:45] <hartfordcyclist> anyone know if jquery.render.js is the "new" official tmpl library, or was that just an idea? - i don't see it in the branch anymore, only in a couple demos
[18:19:57] <gnarf> afaik there is no new official tmpl
[18:27:12] <hartfordcyclist> this is on the jquery ui planning wiki for grid stage 3 - Template (new template plugin being developed by jQuery UI team, successor to jquery-tmpl)
[18:27:39] <hartfordcyclist> i think boris may be working on it, but it doesnt look like its been included in the extern folder in the grid branch
[18:28:12] <hartfordcyclist> its used in a few examples
[18:43:59] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/iXbC8U
[18:43:59] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Spinner: modified _spin and _setOption to call new method _trimValue to check for min/max values. Fixed #7264 - Spinner returns values beyond min and max, off by one - beatryder
[18:46:55] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ^^^
[18:50:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not sure what to do with that ticket tho... http://jqbug.com/ui/7264 --- Were going to have that "bug fix for something not released" in the patch notes thing going on....
[18:50:29] <gnarf> should i just put it back to invalid?
[18:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I added a milestone and version of "git" to Trac the other day
[18:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> so anything that's a bug in git, but not a released version should get a version of "git"
[19:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> if we release the code and the bug still exists, then we'll bump the version to the release version
[19:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> if it's fixed before a release, we set the milestone to git
[19:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> that will prevent it from showing up in the changelog
[19:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> we really shouldn't be filing any tickets against new components though
[19:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> issues should be reported on the forum or the wiki
[19:02:22] <gnarf> yah
[19:06:15] <gnarf> is there any way to leverage view.jqueryui.com to view a commit in my fork?
