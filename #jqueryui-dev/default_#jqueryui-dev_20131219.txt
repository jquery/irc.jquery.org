[07:57:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think we are ready to release
[07:57:51] <gseguin> uGoMobi: The demos are now up on demos.jquerymobile.com using the github repo demos.jquerymobile.com
[07:58:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah, awesome
[07:58:03] <gseguin> ok
[07:58:17] <uGoMobi> thanks gnarf !
[07:58:27] <gseguin> Yup credits to gnarf
[07:59:01] <gseguin> uGoMobi: os release?
[07:59:09] <gseguin> s/os/so/
[07:59:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping
[07:59:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[08:02:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I just want to check with arschmitz and _|Nix|_ but I think we are good to go
[08:02:22] <gseguin> sounds good
[08:02:50] <gseguin> meanwhile I can try to add the new demos process to the release script
[08:03:10] <uGoMobi> when 1.4 final is on the CDN, demos are up, and ZIP is on the server we can switch to the new site
[08:03:42] <uGoMobi> we need help from gnarf with that
[08:04:13] <uGoMobi> and we need to switch the API docs
[08:05:20] <uGoMobi> and let's not forget to update the DB and TR
[08:12:36] <gseguin> gnarf: question for you
[08:39:10] <gnarf> gseguin: sup
[08:40:51] <gseguin> is the current http://jquerymobile.com/demos redirecting to http://demos.jquerymobile.com
[08:40:58] <gseguin> ?
[08:41:23] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[08:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: No. If it was, you'd know.
[08:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because it'd actually redirect.
[08:42:03] <gseguin> duh! :)
[08:42:30] * gseguin needs more coffee or a brain upgrade
[08:44:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we don't want that because we need a landing page with links to different versions
[08:45:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: no I was asking to know what to do with the current release script whether it should still upload the demos to eol2
[08:45:35] <uGoMobi> in other words.... http://jquerymobile.com/demos/ is a WordPress page
[08:45:59] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[08:47:30] <gseguin> that's fine with me
[08:48:06] <gseguin> but http://jquerymobile.com/demos/* redirects to http://demos.jquerymobile.com/*
[08:49:21] <gnarf> gseguin / uGoMobi: well noone told me that yesterday
[08:49:32] <gnarf> http://stage.jquerymobile.com/demos/
[08:49:46] <gnarf> is /demos/ a wordpress page?
[08:49:57] <gseguin> ah dang!
[08:50:15] <uGoMobi> it is
[08:54:15] <gnarf> http://stage.jquerymobile.com/demos/
[08:54:17] <gnarf> got that fixed

[09:37:39] <gseguin> ok there was a slight issue while updating the package.json
[09:38:04] <gseguin> but the rest seems to have gone smoothly
[09:38:14] <uGoMobi> cool
[09:38:20] <uGoMobi> what about package.json?
[09:38:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you create branche 1-3 in the API docs repo and merge 1-4 into master?
[09:39:16] <uGoMobi> s/branche/branch/
[09:43:00] <gseguin> looking into it
[09:43:09] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[09:43:10] <gseguin> please don't push anything
[09:43:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:43:44] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:44:19] <gseguin> I think there might be a missing chdir in the stable release process
[09:44:43] <gseguin> where did you intend to have the commit "Tagging" in?
[09:44:52] <gseguin> in the release branch or in the master branch?
[09:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> In the release branch.
[09:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> The tag should not exist in master.
[09:45:30] <gseguin> oh really, why?
[09:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> Because tags may contain release-specific artifacts.
[09:46:25] <gseguin> ok, what about the "Updating the package.json version commit" ?
[09:46:33] <gseguin> that should be in master, correct?
[09:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[09:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Dit that end up in the wrong branch?
[09:47:49] <gseguin> ok so I think repo._updateBranchVersion is missing a chdir
[09:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> The directory doesn't change.
[09:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> The repo is in the same place.
[09:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> And there's a `git checkout` for the branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/blob/master/lib/repo.js#L169-L174
[09:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's because you chdir() in the new CDN task.
[09:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> Which is now between two tasks that operate on the same repo.
[09:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess the original implementations wasn't too safe.
[09:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> The tasks assumed they knew which directory we were in.
[09:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> That's an easy fix.
[09:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> But did it screw anything up during this release?
[09:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously that commit isn't in jquery-mobile, but that's easy to add manually.
[09:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> Did it push to the CDN?
[09:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> So we should be good for this release, right?
[09:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> Did it fail and not produce a changelog?
[09:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> There was a manual changelog anyway for this release :-)
[09:52:14] <gseguin> just missing a commit in master
[09:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so that's easy to fix manually.
[09:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix the release script too.
[09:53:09] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1080 (master - f09aae0 : Ghislain Seguin): The build passed.

[12:15:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ohw :(
[12:20:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, scott_gonzalez: I just finished reading your article. There are some things that are unclear to me. How does the handlebars helper deal with dynamic content? Do you not still have to pass it the newly loaded content so that it replaces all those templates?
[12:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> The handlebars template is pre-render.
[12:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> It has no dynamic behavior.
[12:21:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So you couldn't use handlebars templates in AJAX-loaded content?
[12:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> The ajax loaded content would use handlebars on the server to render the content.
[12:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> The content you get back is from the request is a fully rendered widget.
[12:23:20] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ... but that requires server buy-in.
[12:24:01] <_|Nix|_> It's basically equivalent to having the server run jqm's autoinit and having it set data-enhanced="true" on the result.
[12:24:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really
[12:24:40] <arschmitz> because in that case the widget still runs for every instance
[12:24:59] <arschmitz> in this case it does not
[12:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's more efficient than data-enhanced="true"
[12:26:01] <_|Nix|_> Right, I see the difference.
[12:27:17] <_|Nix|_> So, we could achieve the same thing with data-enhanced="true" and adding :not([data-enhanced='true']) to the initSelector, as well as modifying the bridge to not freak at a method being called on a non-initialized widget.
[12:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[12:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> You can't achieve the same thing using JavaScript.
[12:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's the whole point.
[12:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> You can get closer to it by doing that.
[12:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> But you still have overhead on every content load.
[12:28:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this is a whole different way of writing it
[12:28:54] <_|Nix|_> I understand, I'm just trying to avoid the server-side part. On a packaged application (like phonegap) the server /is/ the client.
[12:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing to avoid.
[12:29:15] <_|Nix|_> So it would buy us nothing (that I can see).
[12:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> If the content is fully rendered, it doesn't matter how it was rendered.
[12:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> The whole point is to avoid the step of searching the DOM and initializing widgets.
[12:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> How you get there doesn't matter.
[12:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> Handlebars on the server is just one way to do ti.
[12:30:28] <_|Nix|_> That's true. Good! So, you could actually turn this into a packaging step.
[12:30:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and with enhanced option your still running it for every widget huge over head for nothing
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[12:30:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: is the blog post ready?
[12:31:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the text is, but we have to switch to the new site first
[12:31:39] <gseguin> need help with that?
[12:31:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would be in favour of providing a tool that, given a page and a version of UI/Mobile will spit out the enhanced DOM.
[12:32:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, but I think we need to ask gnarf 
[12:32:13] <gseguin> ok
[12:32:24] <uGoMobi> gnarf: ping
[12:33:30] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: can you help with the API docs?
[12:34:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can check if the site exists in jquery-wp-content.
[12:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> But I can't do the puppet changes.
[12:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, site exists.
[12:35:10] <uGoMobi> yeah, we need to wait for gnarf
[12:35:23] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:35:41] <gnarf> just need to flip dns over?
[12:36:18] <gnarf> whats happening?
[12:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like the puppet updates already exist.
[12:36:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, it sounds like that might be a [flag day](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/flag-day.html), because we couldn't do both autoinit and init-free, because we definitely don't want to iterate over the whole DOM only to find two widgets which have not been pre-rendered.
[12:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: The site is already live: http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.3/
[12:37:22] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: but that's only the 1.3 API docs
[12:37:36] <gnarf> if you push a 1.4 tag for api docs it should deploy to live
[12:37:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you do that ^^^
[12:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: You'll want to update https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/api.jquerymobile.com/functions.php#L3
[12:38:34] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/builder.pp#L72-L73
[12:38:35] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: right, I will uncomment that
[12:40:12] <uGoMobi> done
[12:48:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Using the init-free approach, how would you handle the case where the widget attaches, say, a click handler to one of its elements? Without init, clicking on that element will do nothing.
[12:49:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> Read the article again.
[12:52:24] <uGoMobi> ok I guess I can tag the API docs
[12:52:39] <uGoMobi> do I need to use the -a flag when tagging?
[12:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> No, use `npm version 1.4.0`.
[12:52:56] <uGoMobi> or just git tag v1.4.0
[12:53:05] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[12:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> See the section about Deploying to Staging and Production Environments
[12:55:38] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I wanna be sure I read the article correctly. We attach event handlers that would normally be like _create: function() { var x = $( "<div class='x'>" ); this.element.append( x ); this._on( x, "click", "_handleClickOnX" ); } with $( document ).on( "click", ".x", _handleClickOnX ); right?

[14:15:52] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah,  or "Resources" as component maybe?
[14:15:57] <gseguin> ok

[14:18:37] <gseguin> I just checked stage, it's there
[14:19:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you mean tagging jquerymobile.com 1.4.0-1 ?
[14:19:22] <gseguin> yep
[14:19:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sure
[14:19:34] <gseguin> why is there a v in front of the version?
[14:19:40] <gseguin> is that the new standard?

[14:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: That's just what npm does.
[14:23:37] <gseguin> ok
[14:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Please don't tag as 1.4.0-1
[14:23:56] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so revisions of the same jqm version go as -<rev>
[14:23:57] <gseguin> ?
[14:23:58] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: can you create a WordPress useraccount for me on jquerymobile.com?
[14:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> Please read http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[14:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: no
[14:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody has WordPress accounts.
[14:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> What are you trying to do?
[14:24:28] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: blog post
[14:24:41] <uGoMobi> I thought we still had use accounts for that
[14:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't deploy blog.jquerymobile.com, did you?
[14:25:02] <uGoMobi> nope
[14:25:11] <gseguin> oh so we got it all wrong then ;)
[14:25:25] <gseguin> it should have been 1.0.0 then 1.0.1
[14:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> What should've been 1.0.0?
[14:25:47] <gseguin> the website
[14:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> jquerymobile.com should likely have been 1.4.0.
[14:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Then 1.4.1
[14:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> Though 1.0.0 would be fine.
[14:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't care about tracking versions at all.
[14:27:09] <gseguin> yeah it doesn't have to be aligned on the distributable version
[14:27:12] <uGoMobi> I did it wrong in the API docs too :(
[14:27:30] <gseguin> I just tagged 1.4.0-1
[14:27:56] <gseguin> should we retag ?
[14:28:08] <gseguin> and get it right from now on?
[14:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> Don't retag just to create a correctly version tag.
[14:31:23] <gseguin> ok
[14:50:02] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I think I messed up tagging api.jquerymobile.com :(
[14:50:39] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: first I tagged 1.4.0 but not all commits on master had the 1.4.0 tag
[14:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: I'm not sure what you mean.
[14:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> You have 2 tags at the top of master.
[14:51:33] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I thought my repo was out of sync so I cloned again and taggen 1.4.0-1 (should have asked help by then, sorry)
[14:51:54] <scott_gonzalez> Why did you think you were out of sync?
[14:51:55] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: now I see commits in 1-3 branch that have 1.4.0-1 tag
[14:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> As you should.
[14:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> Everything that's not unique to 1.4 will have both tags.
[14:53:07] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: but how does it work with the two versions 1.3 and 1.4 next to each other?
[14:53:22] <gseguin> blog.jquerymobile.com redirects to jquery.com
[14:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> They're in separate branches, and get separate version numbers.
[14:53:28] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: was reading here http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ about that the tags need to have the version number
[14:53:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes I know
[14:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, everything from master should be 1.4.x and everything from 1-3 should be 1.3.x.
[14:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> And you should delete the 1-4 and 1-4-old branches.
[14:54:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: working on API docs, ThemeRoller, and blog at same time... not a success
[14:56:23] <gseguin> uGoMobi: no worries I just wanted to make sure that was known

[15:27:45] <gseguin> the version in 1.4-stable is 1.4.1pre

[15:28:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:36:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: did you upload to the MS CDN as well?
[15:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi gseguin: Do you not expect a 1.4.1 relatively quickly?
[15:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> I tend to wait for at least .1 before branching.
[15:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise you'll create a lot of cherry-picking for yourselves.
[15:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Just `npm version patch` in the 1-3 branch.
[15:39:11] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I was about to do that but I wasn't sure about "1.3.4"
[15:39:40] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: hmm, good point about the cherry-picking
[15:40:03] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: we won't do 1.5 development on master before 1.4.1 release anyway

[19:09:52] <arschmitz> gnarf: Ping!
[19:11:37] <gnarf> arschmitz: sup
[19:11:58] <arschmitz> gnarf: was looking at why the mobile builder is not working
[19:12:19] <arschmitz> gnarf: its because there was a proxy from jquerymobile.com/amd-builder to jq02
[19:13:02] <arschmitz> but i was thinking there is no need for this proxy i can just point the script at jq02 if you prefer?
[19:13:26] <gnarf> is it pointing to jq02 directly?
[19:13:31] <gnarf> i think that has a hostname?
[19:13:47] <arschmitz> it looked like amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[19:13:56] <arschmitz> but i couldnt get that to work so im not sure
[19:14:02] <gnarf> but no dns
[19:14:03] <gnarf> yeah
[19:14:12] <gnarf> let me add that as dns
[19:15:09] <arschmitz> ok
[19:15:43] <gnarf> dns added for amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[19:15:48] <arschmitz> cool
[19:15:57] <arschmitz> so now ill just update the builder to point there
[19:16:02] <gnarf> we should probably keep that instead of the / yeah
[19:16:08] <arschmitz> gnarf: that way we dont need the proxy
[19:16:12] <gnarf> +1
[19:16:36] <gnarf> wouldn't be too hard to setup the proxy anyway, but i'd prefer to avoid them where possible
[19:16:58] <gnarf> i wonder if the nginx does the right thing for that domain tho
[19:17:01] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah and i know scott wants to avoid them on the jquery-wp-content stuff where possible too
[19:17:20] <arschmitz> gnarf: not sure
[19:17:37] <gnarf> seems to redirect to download builder
[19:17:40] <arschmitz> i know it was working using jq02.jquery.com:3100
[19:17:41] <gnarf> is there a port number?
[19:17:45] <gnarf> :3100
[19:17:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[19:17:51] <gnarf> lemme setup a vhost to proxy that via name
[19:18:27] <arschmitz> i want to keep this as simple as possible too because we wont be using it much longer
[19:18:37] <arschmitz> gnarf: we are switching to the ui builder pretty soon
[19:20:13] <gnarf> sure
