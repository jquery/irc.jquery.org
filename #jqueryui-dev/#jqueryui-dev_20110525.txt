[10:00:44] <jstroem> gnarf: there?
[10:00:52] <gnarf> yah
[10:01:13] <gnarf> you weren't in -meeting ;)
[10:01:27] <jstroem>  i am now ^^
[10:02:01] <gnarf> 11:54 jzaefferer: in regards to new effects like split, that'll have to stay in a fork/branch for a while, until we get all the other priorities done
[10:02:30] <gnarf> any updates on split/text jstroem?
[10:02:35] <jstroem> ohh i thought it was now.. :) but okay
[10:02:49] <gnarf> jstroem: hour late... its the grid meeting now ;)
[10:02:51] <jstroem> im have a question about the _normalizeArguments func in $.effects.core im about to use it .text should i just add it to the $.effects._normalizeArgs ?
[10:02:52] <jstroem> or
[10:02:53] <jstroem> ?
[10:03:06] <gnarf> hrm
[10:03:30] * gnarf ponders
[10:04:14] <gnarf> thats the one that takes the "fxname, duration, easing, callback" / etc and compresses it into a single "effect object" right?
[10:04:15] <gnarf> :)
[10:04:52] <jstroem> yeah and normalizes em like checking if speed is a function and if so it is the callback and all that stuff
[10:05:51] <gnarf> core uses "jQuery.speed" to do that
[10:06:17] <gnarf> we could probably make that a public function just undocumented
[10:06:34] <gnarf> although I don't like using "normalizeArguments" as its kinda generic
[10:06:59] <gnarf> but whatevers clever
[10:07:11] <gnarf> if you move it to $.effects.normalizeArguments -- drop the _
[10:07:18] <gnarf> at a minimum
[10:07:21] <jstroem> okay.. im adding it to $.effects.normalizeArgs
[10:07:44] <jstroem> yep.. also my first idea but i just wanted to be sure
[10:07:49] <gnarf> makeEffect()
[10:07:51] <gnarf> i dunno
[10:08:13] <jstroem> it is normalizing the arguments so it is actually a good name
[10:08:28] <gnarf> trying to think of something shorter since its not going to get minified anymore
[10:08:37] <gnarf> prolly doesn't matter tho
[10:09:36] <jstroem> what is the timeframe on the "other priorities" there is needed before pulling the split branch?
[10:09:50] <jstroem> and what are these priorities can i read about them anywhere?
[10:10:28] <gnarf> widgets
[10:10:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: more comments?
[10:12:00] <jstroem> is it the new tooltip and color?
[10:12:11] <gnarf> well color isn't really a priority either ;)
[10:12:23] <gnarf> im just pushing like hell to land it --- its 6 bugs in my tracker!
[10:12:23] <jstroem> ^^
[10:12:52] <jzaefferer> I'll get back to you here when grid meeting is over
[10:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> jstroem: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[10:13:42] <jstroem> thx
[10:14:27] <gnarf> jstroem: you want me to assign http://jqbug.com/ui/6781 to you?
[10:19:14] <jstroem> yep should just find my debug pw
[10:19:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / jstroem -- opinion... textShow / showText
[10:20:20] <jstroem> showText more readable?
[10:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> I like showText
[10:20:37] <gnarf> what about hideText / toggleText / textEffect
[10:20:46] <gnarf> or do we need the last two methods at all?
[10:20:58] <jstroem> right now i have text in the end on all methods
[10:21:13] <gnarf> effectText?
[10:21:17] <jstroem> yep
[10:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think effectText makes sense to have
[10:21:34] <gnarf> i suppose for consistency that makes sense (and likely is only called internally anyway)
[10:21:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its the workhorse in .effect()
[10:22:01] <gnarf> .show()/.hide() delegate to .effect() with mode show/hide
[10:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, but there's also mode: effect
[10:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> we shouldn't have that for text
[10:22:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well, we might have like "earthquake" that doesn't show or hide
[10:22:36] <gnarf> just wiggles the font
[10:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> unless there's like .effectText( "bounce" )
[10:23:05] <gnarf> not that we have that now.... just sayin, its possible we might do non show/hide animations
[10:23:10] <jstroem> so right now we dont have any "earthquake"s but they will come
[10:23:10] <gnarf> Also, we should try and tackle the potential issue with the "destruction" of the text when it hides... How do we store it if we wanted a toggle?  Do we care?
[10:23:39] <jstroem> gnarf: data attr?
[10:24:09] <gnarf> jstroem: yeah, we could .data("hiddenText", jQueryObjThatContainsOriginalTextHTML)
[10:24:31] <gnarf> and then have show default to reading that if no text is specified or something
[10:24:38] <gnarf> naming i'm not so hot on atm
[10:24:44] <gnarf> but whatever's clever
[10:25:10] <jstroem> i try to use something like the jquery ui class naming syntax!
[10:25:23] <gnarf> ec.storage ?
[10:25:32] <gnarf> thats what we used for save/restore
[10:26:31] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6781#comment:8
[10:28:16] <jstroem> yea but i thought more like $.data('ui-hidden-text', data) or something.
[10:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> what actually gets stored?
[10:29:14] <jstroem> in the save/restore functions or in my example?
[10:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> when you do .showText( "explode" )
[10:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> what needs to get stored?
[10:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> raw text, raw html, jQuery object?
[10:29:46] <jstroem> nothing but .hideText( "explode" ) removes the text
[10:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that's what I meant
[10:30:01] <jstroem> so we would save the old html
[10:30:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: / jstroem: i would save the original nodes
[10:30:53] <gnarf> since we clone/wrap them anyway
[10:31:00] <gnarf> right?
[10:31:18] <gnarf> that way we don't lose actual like click events or whatever on a's?
[10:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we should save the original nodes if we can
[10:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> exactly
[10:31:35] <gnarf> be sure to .detach() instead of .remove()
[10:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> so it is this.contents() that needs to be saved?
[10:31:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: basically
[10:32:30] <jstroem> yep.. hmm so by save them do you mean just hide them? or array-like saving?
[10:33:46] <scott_gonzalez> I think you could do content = this.contents().detach(); content.clone().doActualEffect(); this.data( "effect-text", content )
[10:34:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez++
[10:34:30] <gnarf> that was the approach i had in mind too
[10:34:32] <gnarf> and then in show
[10:34:45] <gnarf> var content = opts.content || elem.data("effect-text")
[10:34:48] <jstroem> great!
[10:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> is there currently an implementation for .showText()/.hideText()?
[10:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> no params
[10:35:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i don't believe so
[10:36:44] <gnarf> unless jstroem wrote one already ;)
[10:39:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok, we'll need those
[10:40:04] <gnarf> expected behavior? detach all textnodes?
[10:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:40:21] <gnarf> what about internal divs/spans that have color/decoration
[10:40:24] <gnarf> they stay?
[10:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> the end result should be the same as using any text effect
[10:41:00] <jstroem> i have wrote something in my last push but i havent tested it yet
[10:41:08] <gnarf> hrm
[10:41:47] <gnarf> theres gonna be some weirdness with divs within divs and text effects isn't there
[10:42:36] <jstroem> there is some regex for detecting tags and other things in the input text
[10:42:52] <jstroem> but im into thoese yet!
[10:44:00] <gnarf> coo - keep me up to date, i gotta run... got like 2 hours to prep an interface I'm still working on to show to the client
[10:44:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if you need my comment on a pull - skype me?
[10:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:44:38] <gnarf> closing IRC to get rid of the distraction
[10:48:54] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez did you see this? http://danheberden.com/share/1c7c.png
[10:49:05] <danheberden> paul_irish just mentioned it
[10:49:10] <danheberden> its for pull reqs and issues
[10:49:14] <scott_gonzalez> no
[10:49:21] <danheberden> ( you have commented on that being an annoyance to you before)
[10:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> I want it to auto-enable
[10:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> but it's good to know that it can at least be manually enabled without commenting
[10:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> hooray, GitHub is breaking the web AGAIN
[10:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> command-click does nothing
[10:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> well, it does the ajaxy thing
[10:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> but it prevents the new tab from opening
[10:51:29] <danheberden> :/
[10:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> FUCK! the URLs doesn't even work
[10:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> so it only works via ajax
[10:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> what a joke
[10:53:06] <danheberden> wat
[10:53:14] <danheberden> that wasn't the case before
[10:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> I copied the URL, pasted it into a new tab and got a 404
[11:04:47] <cjm_> http://jsfiddle.net/mgJf2/2/ -> sorry for the ui paste, is this a known issue? any current fix for it?
[11:08:21] <eddiemonge> whats the problem?
[11:10:50] <danheberden> cjm_, side note: you'll find just linking the ui script and css using the "manage resources" area much easier to work with: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/xspfw/
[11:12:01] <eddiemonge> cjm_: there seems like there is a bug in there but the way you have it setup is just so weird.
[11:15:46] <eddiemonge> simplify: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/xspfw/1/  dragging the box below the fold can cause it to vanish
[11:16:07] <eddiemonge> or actually can cause it to go outside of its container
[11:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: http://gyazo.com/1ff64a7701a720b6434fd766cab9b3fb.png
[11:19:22] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: can you traceroute that? it loads in about 11ms for me
[11:20:31] <kborchers> cjm_: It looks like that bug or one very similar has already been reported http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7278
[11:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/be1aee6748f26b07fbc8
[11:21:26] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez there have been some odd issues with the cdn lately :/ i donno if it's mt's server updates or what
[11:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> it's only the ui js file
[11:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> core and the ui theme load instantly
[11:22:07] <danheberden> the same was happening with js on static.jquery.com
[11:22:26] <danheberden> i'll reload the dns
[11:22:55] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez give it a few mins and try again
[11:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:23:37] <danheberden> "please go to start, click "turn off computer" and then click restart"
[11:23:58] <danheberden> i'd be such a good tech support rep
[11:35:02] <cjm_> thanks kborchers, any idea if there's a fix coming?
[11:45:21] <kborchers> cjm_: i don't see anything submitted on github but someone could be working on it. i may look into it.
[11:47:18] <cjm_> ok thanks, here i made a cleaner recreation http://jsfiddle.net/xspfw/2/ Ill try to keep up with it, id like to figure out a workaround but im not sure what the source of the problem is.
[11:55:52] <eddiemonge> cjm_: you are trying to create a scrollbar right? i think you need to switch from document scroll to scrolling a div
[12:02:57] <eddiemonge> how is drop different from slide in the show effects?
[12:04:39] <gnarf> eddiemonge: overflow: hidden
[12:04:49] <gnarf> drop falls out of the box while being displayed
[12:06:11] <eddiemonge> oh actually, in the demos, drop is the same as slide except it fades in or out. i would expect drop to move horizontally instead of vertically though
[12:06:49] <gnarf> eddiemonge: drop and slide both direction up/down/left/right
[12:06:57] <gnarf> the only difference is hiddenness
[12:08:04] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/effects.all.html
[12:08:12] <gnarf> drop will animate opacity too
[12:08:13] <gnarf> sorry
[12:08:16] <gnarf> slide doesnt
[12:11:05] <eddiemonge> ah ok. that wasnt clear in the demos
[12:11:12] <eddiemonge> i thought it was a bug
[12:22:22] <eddiemonge> ok so in the demos for dialog, it states the option for show is a string but it can be an object as well
[12:22:43] <eddiemonge> same with hide. it should be String, Object
[12:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> eddiemonge: can you file a bug?
[12:27:05] <eddiemonge> are the demos in the source? or something else?

[13:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> the docs live at http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[13:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> they get pulled onto jqueryui.com when we release
[13:09:17] <eddiemonge> ugh. thats still in wiki
[13:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we're getting api.jqueryui.com for 1.9
[13:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> it's a work-in-progress
[13:12:22] <eddiemonge> do you know who is working on that?

[13:46:59] <ruprict> So, question about committing/pull requests (working on jquery-ui bug, first timer)
[13:46:59] <ruprict> I submitted the pull request, and Scott came back and said "Fix your tabs, clean up your test, etc" which I've done, so do I just issue a 2nd pull request?
[13:46:59] <ruprict> Or somehow amend the first? Â (Total noob at contributing with git, etc)
[13:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> ruprict: you can do either
[13:51:33] <ruprict> Kâ€¦I'll go with the former, likely.  Sorry about the messynessâ€¦.hopefully I'll get it right on attempt #2.  Thanks for the help.
[13:52:02] <eddiemonge> ruprict: if you commit/push on the same branch, the pull request will get updated
[13:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, was just finding the pull request again to check the branch
[13:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> if you're going to send a new pull request, you should do it in a new branch
[13:52:56] <ruprict> So, create a branch on my forked repo, issue pull request from there?
[13:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> do you know how to do that?
[13:53:21] <ruprict> Uhhhâ€¦.googling it now.
[13:53:46] <ruprict> (so, noâ€¦but this is exactly why I want to contribute.  I should know this stuff....)
[13:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout -b bug-6711
[13:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> then do your commits
[13:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> then git push origin bug-6711
[13:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> assuming you have origin pointing at your fork
[13:54:32] <ruprict> So, I don't need to start the branch on origin first?
[13:55:06] <eddiemonge> ruprict: no. just do like scott said and you should be fine
[13:55:17] <ruprict> Kâ€¦will doâ€¦thanks gents.
[13:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:57:44] <ruprict> That is pretty neato.
[13:58:05] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: oh and no, i dont have access to the wiki. i could grant myself access if i really wanted to but its not as easy as someone granting me access
[13:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> unfortunately I don't know how to do it (or I don't have permission), I always ask John to do it
[13:59:25] <eddiemonge> i could go dig around and add the permissions in mysql but thats too much effort.
[14:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> just ask John in #jquery-dev
[14:13:58] <ruprict> eddiemonge:  When I issue the new pull request, it's from my branch to jquery-ui master branch, correct?
[14:14:11] <eddiemonge> right
[14:14:23] <ruprict> Thanks.
[14:14:24] <eddiemonge> but if youve submitted the pull request already, you dont have to do a new one
[14:14:59] <ruprict> So, I have one out there from my master branch, but it doesn't have all today's commits.
[14:15:34] <ruprict> so, was gonna do the new one the proper way.
[14:16:46] <ruprict> Should I kill the other pull request?
[14:20:14] <eddiemonge> now im confused
[14:21:00] <eddiemonge> so you cloned the repo, created a branch for your bug fix, made your changes, committed your changes, pushed your changes to your github repo, created a pull request
[14:21:28] <eddiemonge> then made more changes to your branch for the bug fix, committed those changes and then pushed them up to your github repo right?
[14:29:09] <ruprict> I didn't create  branch for the first pull request.
[14:29:34] <ruprict> Which is why Scott was saying, if you're gonna do another one, make a branch.
[14:32:01] <eddiemonge> oh ok then yeah close the first request
[14:32:15] <eddiemonge> have you seen see ? patching
[14:32:16] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Tips for jQuery Bug Patching - There are some assumptions made here, one being that you are set up with some form of "localhost" http server and that it's running. http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching
[14:33:16] <ruprict> Cheersâ€¦will read it tonight
[14:33:19] <mandragorn> I've been listening in (also new to jquery-ui dev).   I'm used to git backed by svn.  "git push <branch-to> <branch-from>" is the same as "git svn dcommit" where branch-to is in another repo and branch-from is the current branch?
[14:34:00] <mandragorn> I'm looking at "git push origin bug-6711" that scott mentioned above.
[14:35:31] <eddiemonge> git push your-repo-github your-local-branch-that-you-are-working-on
[14:36:05] <mandragorn> ooh, not used to having repos defined since we just have our local one here and push from it to svn.
[14:38:12] <eddiemonge> interesting that you have git backed by svn. not sure why though
[14:38:55] <mandragorn> because we had svn to start with and are still in the process of evaluating git.
[14:39:05] <mandragorn> basically we haven't migrated the core repo over yet.
[14:40:16] <mandragorn> its a pain in the butt, and prevents us from fully utilizing git... but it works until we can get the time to switch things over.
[19:12:00] <gnarf> what a long day
