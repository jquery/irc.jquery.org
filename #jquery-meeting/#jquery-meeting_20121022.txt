[08:57:52] <mikesherov> ping
[08:57:58] <mikesherov> ?ping
[08:57:59] <bot-t> mikesherov: pong!
[08:58:20] <DaveMethvin> who left the door open?
[08:58:39] <DaveMethvin> the accounting department stole all the donuts
[09:02:37] * gnarf growls at adam
[09:03:02] <DaveMethvin> zowie!
[09:03:20] <saiwong> sausage?
[09:03:24] <gnarf> you should ping ryanneufeld for these meets too :)
[09:03:25] <mikesherov> saiwong!
[09:03:34] <saiwong> werd dawg
[09:03:35] <gibson042> wooo!
[09:03:38] <mikesherov> while we're waiting to aggregate
[09:03:38] <gnarf> in case infra needs a rep
[09:03:41] <gnarf> and i'm not around
[09:03:55] <mikesherov> saiwong says to close these: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11226 http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12503 http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12120#comment:16
[09:04:04] <saiwong> ya I did
[09:04:17] <mikesherov> I concur
[09:04:17] <DaveMethvin> yeh we'll do that
[09:04:23] <mikesherov> OK, I will
[09:04:44] <mikesherov> marking as fixed, not dupe
[09:04:48] <gnarf> brb quick, also there is a REALLY loud thunderstorm outside
[09:04:55] <gnarf> so if I go offline, blame weather
[09:05:12] <mikesherov> milestone is 1.9 right? not 1.8.3?
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> right... "gnarf, how are your assigned tix doing ...  gnarf, gnarf?  must be thunderstorms :D"
[09:05:54] <DaveMethvin> unless it's critical it should be 1.9
[09:06:16] <DaveMethvin> i want to get 1.8.3 out of the way but i need to check my build script
[09:06:20] <DaveMethvin> never done it on a branch
[09:06:38] <DaveMethvin> so let's git it started
[09:07:08] <DaveMethvin> first, congrats to mikesherov and gibson042, i desperately  needed more help in reverting sizzle :D
[09:07:13] <mikesherov> HAHHA
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> poor timmywil
[09:07:39] <DaveMethvin> i think we got that fixed now, the submodule update task wasn't working but now it should be
[09:07:42] <mikesherov> julian's fault
[09:07:50] <mikesherov> yeah, it's fixed
[09:08:01] <DaveMethvin> even works on WINDOWS
[09:08:07] <gnarf> yay!
[09:08:08] <mikesherov> along with the new awesome version of jshint, and the new compare_size from gibson
[09:08:18] <gnarf> My 2 sizzle reverts haven't been for naught!
[09:08:37] <DaveMethvin> so i think the summit went really well, we got lots of great people including saiwong
[09:08:51] <mikesherov> yeah, and carldanley
[09:08:55] <DaveMethvin> and i had a great time
[09:09:01] <mikesherov> and we rediscovered fracmak
[09:09:10] <carldanley> thnx! haha
[09:09:11] <saiwong> yah.. the best thing to happen since sliced cheese
[09:09:20] <DaveMethvin> our table alone was the most awesomest
[09:09:34] <saiwong> I accept full credit on that
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:09:49] <DaveMethvin> i worked through a lot of tix but still have about 20 in the q
[09:10:01] <mikesherov> yeah, and the bug tracker is looking sexy
[09:10:05] <mikesherov> near all time lows
[09:10:07] <DaveMethvin> so slim
[09:10:13] <mikesherov> plus ticketgraph now has "today"
[09:10:25] <DaveMethvin> ceil > floor
[09:10:35] <DaveMethvin> very nice
[09:10:43] <DaveMethvin> now we don't  have to wait for our gratification
[09:10:46] <mikesherov> actually, it was end + 86400 * 1000
[09:10:52] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph?days=150 near all time lows
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> once we land a bunch of 1.9 stuff that will be low
[09:11:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we should branch 1-8-stable even if we don't end up coming back to patch anything in it... Will save us a little hunting if the time comes
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yes, I'll do that todya
[09:12:02] <mikesherov> gnarf: yes
[09:12:03] <DaveMethvin> today
[09:12:25] <DaveMethvin> on the remaining pulls, does anyone else want to grab some of those
[09:12:37] <mikesherov> I can
[09:12:41] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov you had a comment on the offset one
[09:12:51] <mikesherov> including the ones prepended with [1.9]?
[09:12:56] <mikesherov> on which one?
[09:12:58] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:13:03] <DaveMethvin> lemme find it
[09:13:10] <mikesherov> Oh, yeah, it was like you were seeing jitters
[09:13:20] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/899
[09:13:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah has it been like that for a while and i never noticed?
[09:13:36] <mikesherov> No
[09:13:41] <mikesherov> during the summit
[09:13:44] <mikesherov> Jay Merrifield
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> oh ok
[09:13:55] <mikesherov> added a setup / teardown for offset
[09:14:01] <mikesherov> to set fixed pos
[09:14:04] <mikesherov> test*
[09:14:21] <mikesherov> and introduce scroll for each test
[09:14:27] <DaveMethvin> "I don't think we should get rid of bodyOffset."
[09:14:30] <mikesherov> so that we know it works scrolled
[09:14:33] <mikesherov> we shouldn't!
[09:14:43] <mikesherov> bodyOffset is a thin that needs deprecation firwt
[09:14:45] <mikesherov> first*
[09:14:51] <mikesherov> like all of our fake public stuff
[09:14:55] <DaveMethvin> it's being used externally?
[09:15:00] <mikesherov> which is why I hate fake public stuff
[09:15:01] <DaveMethvin> or at least you fear?
[09:15:04] <mikesherov> I fear
[09:15:14] <mikesherov> I fear that on ANY public function
[09:15:22] <DaveMethvin> well it's not public public
[09:15:25] <DaveMethvin> really private public
[09:15:40] <DaveMethvin> peek through the window public
[09:15:48] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12248
[09:15:53] <gnarf> *cough* jQuery.isNumeric
[09:16:11] <DaveMethvin> what moron would .... oh nevermind :D
[09:16:14] <gnarf> only people like me use those things... :)
[09:16:40] <mikesherov> sure
[09:16:43] <DaveMethvin> on 12248 it wasn't clear whether he was using it directly or just using it to prove a point
[09:16:45] <mikesherov> but they're public
[09:16:51] <DaveMethvin> they're exposed
[09:16:54] <mikesherov> yes
[09:17:08] <mikesherov> I mean, at the end of the day, we should settle on public and private
[09:17:15] <DaveMethvin> i'd be okay with taking them out since they're not part of the documented interfaces
[09:17:16] <mikesherov> and have only those two distinction
[09:17:21] <DaveMethvin> and putting a note in the upgrade guide
[09:17:26] <DaveMethvin> same with .attrFn
[09:17:31] <DaveMethvin> and $.uuid
[09:17:31] <mikesherov> : - \
[09:17:51] <mikesherov> I would make everything that meets that requirement now (public but undocumented) truly private
[09:17:58] <mikesherov> so we can never have this convo ever ever again
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> we should look at that list
[09:18:16] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:18:20] <mikesherov> definitely
[09:18:24] <DaveMethvin> there is a bunch of stuff hanging of $.event
[09:18:28] <mikesherov> Right
[09:18:30] <mikesherov> and offset
[09:18:40] <mikesherov> ok, but anyway, that was my concern for that ticket
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> concern noted
[09:18:57] <DaveMethvin> if it was documented i would feel differently
[09:19:14] <mikesherov> and if it was private, I wouldn't have to feel anything :-P
[09:19:22] <mikesherov> ok, next
[09:19:29] <DaveMethvin> feelings ... whoa whoa whoa feelings
[09:19:35] <mikesherov> hahaha
[09:19:47] <DaveMethvin> so i mentioned a common std for landing stuff
[09:19:54] <DaveMethvin> mainly so we're all on the same page for doing it
[09:20:03] <DaveMethvin> and it won't look like a half-dozen people
[09:20:18] <mikesherov> Yeah, I've very into this
[09:20:25] <DaveMethvin> UI  has a common style for commit msgs as well
[09:20:52] <DaveMethvin> i've tried to use "Fix #11111, short description. Close gh-123"
[09:21:14] <DaveMethvin> obviously not all patches fit that mold but as close as possible
[09:21:19] <DaveMethvin> mention the ticket first
[09:21:35] <DaveMethvin> UI uses the widget name as a prefix
[09:21:44] <DaveMethvin> not quite the same situation as ours
[09:21:48] <DaveMethvin> but they are consistent
[09:22:04] <mikesherov> I don't want to troll, but we could automate this with pulley, or a 1 liner git alias
[09:22:09] <mikesherov> at least both steps
[09:22:21] <mikesherov> like squashing, merging, etc… stop for you to test
[09:22:28] <gibson042> I like the git 1 liner
[09:22:29] <mikesherov> and then one other command to land
[09:22:32] <DaveMethvin> if it lets me git commit --amend 4 or 5 times before a push, fine!
[09:22:58] <DaveMethvin> it takes me that many looks before i get the coding style, commit message, etc right
[09:23:19] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean: git checkout master && git pull upstream master && git checkout -b pr$1 && git pull git@github.com ......
[09:24:00] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:24:08] <mikesherov> get it to the point where you're literally just editing the commit message, and you provide pr number and ticktet number as args (like pulley)
[09:24:20] <mikesherov> but then it would stop and let you poke around
[09:24:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: our format is actually:
[09:24:37] <gnarf> Component: short desc - Fixes #bug - bug title - Closes gh-issue
[09:24:42] <mikesherov> I mean, make it a grunt command actually
[09:24:46] <mikesherov> grunt land-pull
[09:24:56] <mikesherov> but anyway
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: sounds dreamy to me!
[09:25:05] <mikesherov> I'll just put the pulley code into grunt
[09:25:10] <mikesherov> and make it two separate commands
[09:25:11] <gnarf> mikesherov / DaveMethvin: ben_alman already did a pullyish grunt task
[09:25:18] <gnarf> might wanna check with him first
[09:25:26] <mikesherov> gnarf: that's because he looked at the pulley code to do it
[09:25:38] <mikesherov> I was in IRC when we were talking about it
[09:25:46] <mikesherov> so I'll ping him about it
[09:25:51] <mikesherov> good suggestion
[09:25:56] <DaveMethvin> seems like we're in a code-stealing loop
[09:26:02] <mikesherov> sharing
[09:26:06] <mikesherov> it's sharing if it's open source
[09:26:06] <DaveMethvin> "sharing"
[09:26:07] <mikesherov> :-P
[09:26:12] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:26:16] <DaveMethvin> authors file
[09:26:20] <DaveMethvin> thanks for cleaning that up mikesherov
[09:26:25] <mikesherov> NP
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> i have a few to add from responses last night
[09:26:35] <mikesherov> great
[09:26:44] <DaveMethvin> we really added a lot of people
[09:26:47] <DaveMethvin> which is great
[09:26:54] <mikesherov> yeah, at least 9 by my count
[09:27:22] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg isn't here but we can talk a bit about promise/j if you want
[09:27:42] <DaveMethvin> we really do need to explain the differences better
[09:27:48] <mikesherov> My thought is that we write it up anyway, and then publish if we like it
[09:28:04] <DaveMethvin> i want to cover some of this on learn.jquery.com
[09:28:21] <DaveMethvin> i can write most of it but want some input
[09:28:48] <DaveMethvin> promise/a makes it difficult to debug and i don't think a lot of ppl realize it
[09:29:03] <DaveMethvin> like for our promises, an error shows up in the console and you deal with it
[09:29:17] <mikesherov> which is a FEATURE
[09:29:18] <DaveMethvin> but for p/a it gets caught and you're responsible for doing something with it
[09:29:19] <mikesherov> not a bug
[09:29:41] <DaveMethvin> and instead of a line number , you get only a string like "object expected" as your error
[09:29:50] <saiwong> yeah.. that part with p/a always weirded me out
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> so you have like 736 lines of code  where some object is expected
[09:30:03] <DaveMethvin> and you can't tell wehre
[09:30:26] <mikesherov> so I saw a commit that jaubourg did that makes then promises/a but keeps pipe promises/j
[09:30:32] <DaveMethvin> it's great to catch errors, except when you're trying to figure out the error
[09:30:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah he's got a branch going
[09:30:40] <mikesherov> I think he's acquiesced at this point
[09:30:57] <DaveMethvin> well if we do both, people can choose their poisin
[09:31:00] <DaveMethvin> poison*
[09:31:18] <DaveMethvin> the only pain point is the people who are using .then() atm and have changed semantics
[09:31:30] <DaveMethvin> but i am SO TIRED of hearing domenic bitch about this
[09:31:44] <DaveMethvin> let the 1% dictate to the 99%
[09:32:04] <mikesherov> politics, smholitics
[09:32:16] <DaveMethvin> hokay, next thang
[09:32:19] <DaveMethvin> speed tests
[09:32:24] <mikesherov> YES
[09:32:26] <mikesherov> nuke them
[09:32:45] <mikesherov> :-p
[09:32:46] <DaveMethvin> we'd be better starting with timmywil's stuff and changing that
[09:32:53] <mikesherov> right
[09:33:00] <DaveMethvin> i don't think there is anything too valuable there
[09:33:04] <mikesherov> I mean, there's a second thing I wanted to do too though
[09:33:19] <mikesherov> basically, jsperf.com but targetted
[09:33:19] <DaveMethvin> the general idea of checking for version-to-version regressions is very good tho
[09:33:25] <mikesherov> same code, different lib
[09:33:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:33:47] <mikesherov> I'd love to help out here
[09:34:06] <gnarf> so DaveMethvin- AFAIK the big diff between /A and us now is the exceptions issue
[09:34:16] <mikesherov> gnarf: ypu
[09:34:18] <mikesherov> ypu*
[09:34:19] <gnarf> which is one I'm of the opinion noone on this team wants us to solve
[09:34:31] <gnarf> the ".then()" === ".pipe()" is now the case as of 1.8
[09:34:45] <DaveMethvin> pushStack()
[09:35:04] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: if .then() always caught the error and did a .reject(Error object)
[09:35:07] <DaveMethvin> that would fix it
[09:35:18] <mikesherov> right
[09:35:21] <DaveMethvin> but mean that the user HAD to understand their fail handlers would get calle dwith Error
[09:35:29] <DaveMethvin> and not try to reject some other way
[09:35:32] <DaveMethvin> pop
[09:35:48] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: do you want to see what you can put together?
[09:35:55] <mikesherov> for the speed stuff?
[09:35:58] <mikesherov> sure
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> something simple for now with a decent framework would be sweet
[09:36:12] <mikesherov> assigning ticket
[09:36:19] <DaveMethvin> and have it test against 1.7, 1.8, git
[09:36:52] <DaveMethvin> i can imagine we might want to run that in testswarm every so often
[09:37:06] <DaveMethvin> okay
[09:37:24] <DaveMethvin> that link to the google doc is the one gibson042 started for 1.9 notes
[09:37:37] <DaveMethvin> i'll evolve that into the 1.9 upgrade guide
[09:37:48] <DaveMethvin> inspired by scott's guide for ui 1.9
[09:38:02] <DaveMethvin> lots of detail about what changed in any api
[09:38:10] <DaveMethvin> users will need that
[09:38:23] <mikesherov> cool
[09:38:27] <DaveMethvin> so if you want to add some notes there feel free
[09:38:44] <DaveMethvin> i'll go through tickets at some point but sometimes it's easier to write it down as you think of it
[09:40:01] <mikesherov> this is a better assigned link, btw: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&group=owner&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=milestone&col=changetime&report=506&order=priority
[09:40:13] <mikesherov> groups by owner so we know who to shame :-P
[09:40:23] <gibson042> do we want a separate format for no-PR commits? I've got one ready and there's no time like the present
[09:40:31] <DaveMethvin> shame? noooo! "encourage"!
[09:40:42] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: whatcha got?
[09:41:02] <gibson042> adding back $.uuid etc. for 1.8.3, to be removed for 1.9
[09:41:23] <DaveMethvin> i'll be branching from last week so we're good i think
[09:41:24] <gibson042> and a few tweaks in deprecated.js to make it easy on us later
[09:41:27] <gibson042> ah, ok
[09:41:33] <gnarf> gibson042: without PR - Component: short message
[09:41:42] <mikesherov> cool
[09:41:53] <gnarf> if there isn't a ticket, we just leave it out
[09:42:01] <gnarf> although on UI few things happen without a ticket
[09:42:18] <DaveMethvin> in general the same should be true for us
[09:42:29] <gnarf> even fewer without a PR
[09:42:33] <DaveMethvin> if it's something we need to document it shoudl have a ticket
[09:42:47] <DaveMethvin> and yeah, the only person who does a lot without a pr is jaubourg
[09:43:07] <DaveMethvin> he's working with jquery/jquery as his origin
[09:43:20] <DaveMethvin> gotta break him of that
[09:43:29] <saiwong> easy.. deny access
[09:43:40] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:43:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:43:44] <timmywil> ah! I'm here
[09:43:50] <mikesherov> 45 minutes
[09:43:54] <DaveMethvin> soo, assighed tickets
[09:43:55] <mikesherov> not bad!
[09:44:08] <DaveMethvin> oh man, i have another meeting in 1 minute...
[09:44:27] <mikesherov> there's a few tickets I want to close that are on other people
[09:44:28] <DaveMethvin> mondays, y u so busy
[09:44:29] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[09:44:35] <timmywil> srsly
[09:44:43] <mikesherov> how do I do that?
[09:45:05] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: ones you fixed?
[09:45:13] <mikesherov> no, one's that wont ever be fixed
[09:45:19] <DaveMethvin> oh just close them
[09:45:28] <mikesherov> or should be stripped of the current owner because they are doing nothing with it
[09:45:43] <mikesherov> for example: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10485
[09:45:49] <mikesherov> was a good thought
[09:45:56] <DaveMethvin> you should be able to reassign or use the bail out
[09:46:05] <mikesherov> I mean, culturally
[09:46:05] <DaveMethvin> you can bail out on their behalf
[09:46:14] <mikesherov> not procedurally
[09:46:23] <mikesherov> Like I think we should not only review new tickets
[09:46:30] <DaveMethvin> oh, yeah rwaldron's eyes are bigger than his stomach
[09:46:31] <mikesherov> but ask people what the deal is with assigned tixx
[09:46:47] <timmywil> FYI, the speed suite I wrote for sizzle is specially tuned for selector engines (iframe per selector PER engine). May not be quite right for jQuery as a whole, but rwaldron had a suggestion on adapting some existing project
[09:47:11] <DaveMethvin> if someone is holding a ticket for a while they should either fix it or release it
[09:47:19] <mikesherov> right
[09:47:25] <mikesherov> but how do we ensure that happens?
[09:47:28] <DaveMethvin> esp now that we have willing volunteers
[09:47:31] <mikesherov> RIGHT
[09:47:53] <DaveMethvin> let me put a message to that effect into the notes
[09:47:55] <saiwong> can that be automated?
[09:47:58] <timmywil> so we should go through our assigned tix and drop them if we can't get to them before the next release
[09:48:03] <DaveMethvin> saiwong: just thinking about that
[09:48:11] <DaveMethvin> mass-unassign and make people reclaim
[09:48:14] <mikesherov> I think we should once a month go through
[09:48:18] <mikesherov> I'll go first even
[09:48:25] <mikesherov> I have a ticket right now I don't plan on doing
[09:48:29] <mikesherov> I can release it right now
[09:48:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, saiwong: that could get really annoying
[09:48:36] <DaveMethvin> well just this once
[09:48:45] <DaveMethvin> b/c there are a lot that have been assigned for a year
[09:48:51] <mikesherov> Right
[09:48:57] <mikesherov> this is the "new" problem but in reverse
[09:49:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah it prevents others from thinking they can try to tackle it
[09:49:13] <mikesherov> jQuery UI has 350 "new" tickets that aren't new
[09:49:22] <timmywil> sure, they need review, but isn't the best person to review them the one who is assigned?
[09:49:24] <mikesherov> jQuery has 50 tickets that are assigned that no one is working on
[09:49:30] <saiwong> well.. the automation should alert the person prior to doing any actions
[09:49:38] <mikesherov> timmywil: I agree manual
[09:49:41] <mikesherov> and it's easy enough
[09:49:45] <saiwong> and a no response will dictate that the person abandoned it
[09:49:48] <timmywil> unassigning takes them out of a report that conveniently has them all right there
[09:50:05] <mikesherov> I agree with timmywil here
[09:50:18] <mikesherov> and it's gotta be part of our responsibility to each other
[09:50:20] <mikesherov> trust but verify
[09:50:36] <mikesherov> and for people who aren't in this meeting or active, we can unassign manually after a while
[09:50:41] <timmywil> now if there are tix assigned to snover or jitters or something...
[09:50:44] <mikesherov> no need to automate here
[09:51:02] <snover> if that’s the case then you just know they are already fixed
[09:51:07] <snover> and are perfect
[09:51:08] <mikesherov> right, like I went through UI and took rworth off all his tickets, but I did it manually and they were 4 years old
[09:51:14] <timmywil> snover: true facts
[09:51:23] <mikesherov> lol @ snover
[09:51:30] <mikesherov> snover knows the deal here
[09:51:32] <DaveMethvin> gotta find all snover's fixed tickets and mark them broken
[09:51:35] <mikesherov> you need pending automation for noobs
[09:51:41] <mikesherov> but for us, just talk to each other
[09:51:50] <DaveMethvin> okay i added some notes
[09:52:01] <mikesherov> let's just do me right now... I have this ticket that I'm giving up because I'm not going to do it
[09:52:05] <gnarf> I'll go through my own assignments after this meet
[09:52:10] <DaveMethvin> as will i
[09:52:15] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814
[09:52:18] <timmywil> ditto
[09:52:19] <DaveMethvin> we shall set a good eample
[09:52:21] <mikesherov> someone take it if you'd like
[09:52:25] <DaveMethvin> example*
[09:52:45] <DaveMethvin> okay, sorry guys but i have to run
[09:53:02] <DaveMethvin> if you want to talk about other stuff feel free
[09:53:13] <mikesherov> when are we tallying 1.9 votes?
[09:53:19] <mikesherov> I have an itchy close finger
[09:53:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we should be good for now, everyone go through assigned tix. rwaldron and I need to talk about a speed suite
[09:53:33] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: next week?
[09:53:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah next week sounds good, so VOTE
[09:54:21] <saiwong> wondering how I can start taking tickets? just fix and make a PR?
[09:54:35] <gnarf> saiwong: talk over the ticket/approach in -dev
[09:54:44] <saiwong> ahh.. cool
[09:54:51] <gnarf> if its unassigned, there's a good chance we want your PR :)
[09:55:14] <timmywil> thanks all, back to dev then
[09:55:15] <mikesherov> yeah, saiwong: just mention the ticket in IRC, then make a pull, then link to the pull in the ticket, and post the pull link in IRC
[09:55:21] <gibson042> I still don't see the vote widget, btw
[09:55:31] <gibson042> is that one for you, gnarf?
[09:55:45] <mikesherov> gibson042: ask danheberden or gnarf…. it's a hardcoded list
