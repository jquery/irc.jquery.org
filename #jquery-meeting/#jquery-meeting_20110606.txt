[09:00:37] <JohnResig> hey all
[09:00:45] <JohnResig> I'm running the final vote count for 1.7 now
[09:00:51] <jaubourg> k
[09:01:17] <rwaldron> Here.
[09:01:41] <louisremi> ok
[09:01:45] <jzaefferer> okay, guess I can stop voting then?
[09:01:55] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: probably, yeah :)
[09:02:17] <jzaefferer> well, I hope my vote on #7523 still counts
[09:02:31] <DaveMethvin> the polls are closed!
[09:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> we need a better voting system next time
[09:03:29] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: how would you make it better?
[09:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> especially if something that got voted on for 1.7 gets voted on again for 1.8
[09:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> are we removing the vote comments afterward?
[09:03:50] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: no, we're not
[09:03:54] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: well, for one, I should be able to see what I haven't voted on
[09:04:04] <addyosmani> you'd prefer cross-reference support or something along those lines scrott_gonzalez?
[09:04:09] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: patches welcome!
[09:04:15] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:04:30] <JohnResig> OK
[09:04:35] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: you mean more than the description?
[09:04:35] <JohnResig> so I have the votes in the spreadsheet
[09:04:53] <DaveMethvin> did al gore win this time?
[09:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: I know I didn't vote on about 10 tickets, I have no idea which ones
[09:05:03] <jaubourg> Dave: I wish
[09:05:04] <addyosmani> al gore nevar wins
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> to find out, I'd have to look at all 81 tickets individually
[09:05:24] <DaveMethvin> an inconvenient patch
[09:05:33] <addyosmani> lol
[09:05:33] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: ah, ok
[09:05:36] <JohnResig> here is a final vote talley: https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&key=0AuWerG7Xqt-8dG0yTEs2ZTFWQUhDRUp5dzRyc3NwV2c&hl=en&gid=2
[09:06:07] <JohnResig> we have a bunch that didn't get a single down vote
[09:06:14] <JohnResig> we can move through those pretty quickly
[09:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> does miketaylr win a prize?
[09:06:34] <miketaylr> haha
[09:06:34] <JohnResig> (and a bunch that didn't get a single upvote)
[09:07:18] <JohnResig> is everyone OK with me going through all the no downvote ones and just assigning them to 1.7?
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> ok with me
[09:07:28] <jaubourg> fine by me
[09:07:32] <rwaldron> I think thats fine
[09:07:32] <JohnResig> and me going through all the no upvote ones and closing them as wontfix (or similar)
[09:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:07:42] <JohnResig> OK
[09:07:43] <jaubourg> +1 :P
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a good start
[09:07:58] <rwaldron> What an agreeable bunch we are today <3
[09:08:03] <louisremi> it depends whether I reported the bug or not
[09:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: some with no upvotes might have some good commentes
[09:08:06] <timmywil> and all the all downvote ones can be closed?
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> might be worth reading through them before closing
[09:08:33] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: well, we're not deleting the tickets, right?
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> but not in the meeting
[09:08:51] <jzaefferer> is there any long-term plan to "clean up jQuery"? like a jQuery 2.0 that isn't backwards compatible?
[09:08:59] <DaveMethvin> you can always resurrect them if we made some mistakes
[09:09:08] <jzaefferer> if that is a desirable milestone, some of those tickets could get assigned to that
[09:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: sure, go ahead and just close them, I'll check if there were any interesting ones we should circle back on for some reason
[09:09:19] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: k!
[09:09:20] <rwaldron> jzaefferer i think at jQuery Conf SF, there was a definitive "no"
[09:09:23] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: not really, no
[09:09:33] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: most of the no-upvote ones are plugin requests
[09:09:38] <DaveMethvin> i would like to have 1.7 deprecate a list of things that we might be able to pull out or pluginify in the future
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think 1.7 should pull out any features
[09:09:51] <jaubourg> +1 dave
[09:09:54] <rwaldron> $.browser?
[09:09:58] <rwaldron> >:|
[09:10:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah like that
[09:10:04] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: shouldn't we have voted on that?
[09:10:05] <rwaldron> we can take a stand
[09:10:12] <DaveMethvin> we kind of did, with :input
[09:10:13] <addyosmani> was about to mention $.browser - are we deprecating that this time?
[09:10:24] <JohnResig> well, we didn't vote on it, so no
[09:10:24] <rwaldron> be  the first library to _officially_ drop support for browser sniffing
[09:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> there were tickets for deprecating specific features
[09:10:37] <jzaefferer> like :input
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> browser is alrready on the deprecation list but we aren't taking it out now
[09:10:46] <jzaefferer> didn't get to vote on that, but deprecating it makes sense
[09:10:53] <jzaefferer> need to get people of that lawn
[09:10:59] <jzaefferer> even though I originally added that :o
[09:11:10] <JohnResig> ok, let's talk about the contenteous issues
[09:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> what we need is MORE people on that lawn...specifically browser vendors :-)
[09:11:17] <jzaefferer> outerWidth/Height?
[09:11:22] <ajpiano> $.browser is among those :/
[09:11:28] <danheberden> jzaefferer and it got a lot of +1 votes
[09:11:54] <JohnResig> First up: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6652
[09:12:14] <jaubourg> ok, so it's me
[09:12:50] <jzaefferer> config flag sounds like a bad idea
[09:12:58] <rwaldron> 6652 seems to ahve been proposed twice?
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> oh god no config flag please!
[09:13:03] <ben_alman> meh i forgot to join
[09:13:04] <timmywil> agreed
[09:13:10] <jzaefferer> can we assign to 1.7 and try to find a good solution?
[09:13:16] <rwaldron> this ticket and I think scott_gonzalez wrote a similar proposal
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> so I don't think the proposed implementation is what we want
[09:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> as pointed out by a few comments
[09:13:44] <ben_alman> for which ticket?
[09:13:45] <jaubourg> I still don't like it, but if I'm the only one, no biggy
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> but I think we can handle this in specific methods
[09:13:56] <JohnResig> yeah, I wasn't keen on the proposed solution either
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin>  ben_alman http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6652
[09:14:05] <rwaldron> right, scott_gonzalez I had +0'ed this in favor of your proposal
[09:14:06] <timmywil> needs to check if the default opacity would be 1 before removing
[09:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> like fadeIn and fadeOut can specifically remove it
[09:14:11] <jzaefferer> we are voting on tackling the issue, not on the proposed solution, right?
[09:14:13] <timmywil> or save the orig
[09:14:18] <timmywil> which it does
[09:14:20] <timmywil> hmmm
[09:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> but maybe not fadeTo even if it hits 100%
[09:15:15] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I think it could if that's what it will be without the filter (if there's an easy way to know that)
[09:15:27] <jaubourg> I dunno, I feel like it's a lot of trouble for something that will look horrid while animating
[09:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> sure, the more places we can remove it, the better
[09:15:33] <jaubourg> anyway
[09:15:51] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i agree debate is prolly best kept to whether to tackle the issue, and it may turn out we have no tackler or no solution in 1.7 after someone takes a look
[09:15:55] <timmywil> jaubourg: not a really a during-animation issue
[09:16:06] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin jzaefferer +1
[09:16:06] <JohnResig> ok, so yes to 6652, pending solution
[09:16:12] <rwaldron> JohnResig +1
[09:16:15] <addyosmani> +1
[09:16:25] <JohnResig> next up: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8157
[09:16:31] <jaubourg> timmy: well, the rendering problem will occur while animating... I know that first hand by having dealt with it on a site I made
[09:16:38] <JohnResig> jaubourg: you again ;)
[09:16:43] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:17:21] <jaubourg> scott: you confirm it's not a change event trigerred when there's no change we want here?
[09:17:25] <timmywil> it's a little confusing.  not sure jaubourg saw the problem at the time
[09:17:26] <jaubourg> (just saw your comment)
[09:17:36] <jzaefferer> #8157 looks like Julian didn't get it, but everyone else did and +1 ?
[09:17:39] <rwaldron> ( JohnResig I add 6652 to the meeting doc )
[09:17:42] <rwaldron> added*
[09:17:53] <JohnResig> rwaldron: I've been keeping track of the votes in the spreadsheet
[09:17:56] <jaubourg> if it's a real change we fail to detect, then fix
[09:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> jaubourg: did you see the jsbin?
[09:18:06] <rwaldron> ok cool, i'll let you do that
[09:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's a real change that we fail to detect
[09:18:10] <jaubourg> I was confused by how the thing was being presented
[09:18:19] <JohnResig> rwaldron: for example: http://gyazo.com/dcb50d360c9202200a4870dafd3413d8.png
[09:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> our special change event listens to focus and clears a flag
[09:18:29] <rwaldron> JohnResig awesome
[09:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> but if the field is already focused, then the flag shouldn't get cleared
[09:18:36] <jaubourg> ok
[09:18:41] <jaubourg> -1 => +1
[09:18:43] <jaubourg> next
[09:18:49] <JohnResig> K
[09:18:57] <JohnResig> I want to circle back and make sure we're on the same page for: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6362
[09:19:16] <ben_alman> at some point i want to discuss #4446 and #4596 together
[09:19:36] <JohnResig> ben_alman: we'll get there
[09:19:41] <ben_alman> just making sure
[09:19:43] <ben_alman> np
[09:19:50] <JohnResig> ben_alman: we can do it next
[09:19:58] <jzaefferer> after rereading, +1 on #6362
[09:20:13] <ajpiano> what is the exact change we're planning to make for 6362? just changing what .index("selector") does?
[09:20:48] <JohnResig> yeah, I guess we need to figure out exactly what we're changing it to
[09:20:49] <rwaldron> As noted in my +1, I want it named semantically.
[09:20:56] <addyosmani> Didn't vote on it, but agree with rwaldron's comment about a more semantically correct name for the thing.
[09:21:00] <rwaldron> Its like "indexOf"
[09:21:02] <addyosmani> ^ what he said.
[09:21:09] <jaubourg> +1 rick tooµ
[09:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> I wrote .ordinal() years ago
[09:21:23] <rwaldron> all: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/9R9kP/
[09:21:27] <DaveMethvin> well if we create a new name the semantics are a blank slate
[09:21:28] <JohnResig> it seems like it should be the equivalent of doing a filter and finding the position of the first element that matches that
[09:21:30] <ben_alman> it sounds like the requist is to add an additional signature?
[09:21:35] <ajpiano> cause the OP is actually requesting a new signature
[09:21:35] <ajpiano> lol
[09:21:37] <JohnResig> instead of the .children() thing we have now
[09:21:39] <rwaldron> eh, that fiddles sucks
[09:21:59] <JohnResig> rwaldron: yeah, essentially like what you have
[09:22:04] <ben_alman> but there already is a string signature
[09:22:06] <ajpiano> JohnResig, the .children() is only when you do .index() with no args, isn't it?
[09:22:11] <ben_alman> so his request would break back-compat
[09:22:13] <JohnResig> uhhh
[09:22:32] <ajpiano> ben_alman, it's not a "new" signature, currently you can pass a jquery obj and it'll use the first elem
[09:22:51] <JohnResig> ajpiano: you're right - the string does a global selector
[09:22:56] <rwaldron> ajpiano ben_alman http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/9R9kP/
[09:23:02] <JohnResig> a relative filter would make more sense
[09:23:04] <ben_alman> right now $(elem).index(selector) will find elem in selector, he wants $(elems).index(selector) to find selector in elems
[09:23:07] <jaubourg> heh
[09:23:11] <ben_alman> right?
[09:23:18] <ben_alman> or have i got it wrong
[09:23:21] <JohnResig> ben_alman: right, and I agree with that
[09:23:33] <JohnResig> so what we need to figure out is if we care strongly enough about this to break the old API
[09:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://projects.workxpress.com/js/src/jquery/jquery.ordinal.js
[09:23:48] <timmywil> I'm meh
[09:23:57] <JohnResig> considering how much people freak out over API changes, this may have to get a pass
[09:24:02] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:24:05] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:24:06] <JohnResig> (even though I like the proposed change)
[09:24:07] <DaveMethvin> i would not change a sig like that ... deprecate index and replace with indexOf if it's needed
[09:24:08] <ben_alman> i do as well
[09:24:15] <rwaldron> but I'm pretty sure the request is not to break anything
[09:24:20] <addyosmani> +1 DaveMethvin
[09:24:21] <ben_alman> can we put it on a "look at for 3.0" list?
[09:24:24] <rwaldron> or change anything in existance
[09:24:28] <rwaldron> but to _add_ something new
[09:24:37] <rwaldron> they just gave a crappy name for it
[09:24:39] <JohnResig> ben_alman: I'll add a revisit-2.0 keyword to it
[09:24:40] <rwaldron> "indexIn"
[09:24:51] <DaveMethvin> if it's a proposal to add indexOf or indexIn I think it would be nice to prove its value
[09:24:53] <ben_alman> rwaldron, i think he wants to change the existing signature to work as an .indexIn method and change the current .index method
[09:25:03] <ben_alman> to support the new behavior
[09:25:05] <jzaefferer> JohnResig: didn't you say five minutes ago there won't be a 2.0?
[09:25:11] <ajpiano> the way the current string one is designed assumes you're trying to find out the index of a single element you already have, not search a set of element sfor a particular selector
[09:25:15] <ben_alman> jzaefferer, that's why i suggested 3.0
[09:25:17] <ben_alman> :P
[09:25:20] <jaubourg> jorn: shush you :P
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:25:26] <addyosmani> JohnResig, will you be putting together a report for any revisit-2.0 items that get tagged as such?
[09:25:26] <rwaldron> eh. eff breaking things
[09:25:34] <JohnResig> addyosmani: yes!
[09:25:39] <addyosmani> great!
[09:25:48] <ajpiano> rwaldron: jzaefferer i think the "there is no 2.0" thing means "there isn't going to be a gigantic paradigm shift"
[09:25:52] <ajpiano> it doesn't mean there won't be a jquery versoin 2.0
[09:26:04] <ben_alman> moving on?
[09:26:08] <JohnResig> I'm using "2.0" as a metaphor here for "things that'll break stuff"
[09:26:13] <JohnResig> ok, next bug
[09:26:16] <jzaefferer> I mean like a 2.0 where .each and $.each has the right signatureâ€¦
[09:26:21] <jzaefferer> *have
[09:26:40] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: that ship has sailed ... :P
[09:26:42] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8685
[09:26:52] <rwaldron> 27 mins... 3 tickets.
[09:27:00] <JohnResig> wait... this is 6 yes
[09:27:02] <JohnResig> hang on
[09:27:06] <ajpiano> JohnResig: ya.... was... ok
[09:27:07] <ajpiano> :p
[09:27:17] <ajpiano> ps i'm super hapy that got tackled :)
[09:27:20] <JohnResig> oh, nm
[09:27:23] <timmywil> but hot though rite?
[09:27:29] <timmywil> :D
[09:27:36] <ajpiano> timmywil: ya for real :)
[09:27:39] <JohnResig> ok, animate hooks: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8498
[09:27:54] <jaubourg> jaubourg again
[09:27:59] <JohnResig> and DaveMethvin
[09:28:05] <ajpiano> seems like a bunch of people weren't really into animateHooks, per se
[09:28:06] <JohnResig> so I want to be clear what I'm talking about here
[09:28:08] <timmywil> it's cause he's french or something
[09:28:13] <addyosmani> +1 to timmywil's solution.
[09:28:13] <ajpiano> but rather having .animate take a look at cssHooks when animating
[09:28:24] <DaveMethvin> The growth of the animation code has me worried
[09:28:38] <JohnResig> I really like adding hooks for gnarf
[09:28:46] <ajpiano> gnarfHooks?
[09:28:46] <JohnResig> *like what gnarf proposed
[09:28:47] <jaubourg> I think the problem is that cssHooks doesn't provide any string transformation utility... just setting stuff in the element
[09:29:00] <JohnResig> I think we should set hooks for that
[09:29:05] <jaubourg> we should expand cssHooks
[09:29:09] <JohnResig> meta-level hooks for CSS
[09:29:13] <jaubourg> not bury things in effects.js
[09:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> animate can't use cssHooks
[09:29:15] <JohnResig> forget the animate business
[09:29:36] <JohnResig> I want it so that people can make meta-property plugins mapping margin -> margin stuff
[09:29:42] <JohnResig> same thing for border, padding, etc.
[09:29:43] <jaubourg> +1 john
[09:29:45] <JohnResig> and other properties
[09:29:52] <rwaldron> +1
[09:29:52] <timmywil> the problem is some things should really only be for effects (setting margin in css is different than animating)
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> i like that, esp if it keeps them from asking to have core include it
[09:30:09] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: yep!
[09:30:12] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin helllllssss yeah
[09:30:17] <jzaefferer> what does "mapping margin -> margin" mean?
[09:30:35] <louisremi> I think I already ask that question but cannot remember the answer : Can't all that already be achieved through $.fx.step.margin ?
[09:30:35] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: see: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8498#comment:9
[09:30:42] <jaubourg> maring => marginTop, marginRight, marginBottom, marginRight
[09:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> louisremi: no
[09:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> you need to animate individual sides individually
[09:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> wel, maybe, but not in a DRY way
[09:31:30] <JohnResig> ok, so next one
[09:31:32] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9401
[09:31:34] <louisremi> scott_gonzalez: but you could do that in your step function
[09:31:37] <JohnResig> better hooks organization
[09:31:46] <timmywil> maybe add the map thing to cssHooks, but not add the logic in css to read from maps (more of an effects-only map)
[09:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> some props shouldn't animate
[09:32:01] <rwaldron> So, I proposed this, but honestly... its like way too much effort and will likely be a headache
[09:32:05] <JohnResig> timmywil: we can explore both
[09:32:14] <JohnResig> rwaldron: ok yeah, minimal benefit
[09:32:20] <JohnResig> let's cut it!
[09:32:25] <rwaldron> SNIP
[09:32:28] <jaubourg> next :)
[09:32:41] <ajpiano> thanks rwaldron, just saved me a lot of typing
[09:32:41] <ajpiano> :p
[09:32:44] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5684
[09:32:55] <rwaldron> ajpiano secretly, I'm a reasonable guy
[09:33:01] <timmywil> I gotta run to a meeting.  bbl!
[09:33:02] <JohnResig> so it seems like we want to fix this, we're just not sure if a solution exists
[09:33:09] <JohnResig> so yes to this, pending working solution
[09:33:13] <ben_alman> ajpiano, don't you hate having all that typing then just cmd-a, delete ?
[09:33:25] <jaubourg> yep, as long as the original exception is not lost, I'll take any solution
[09:33:40] <ajpiano> ben_alman: didn't get that far ;)
[09:33:45] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6838
[09:33:46] <ben_alman> nice
[09:34:08] <JohnResig> so this is a gnarly sizzle bug
[09:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> we should definitely fix that, I think only priority needs to be discussed
[09:34:20] <JohnResig> positioning semantics inside of :not() has always been weird
[09:34:31] <ben_alman> JohnResig, does .not(':first') work correctly?
[09:35:17] <ben_alman> er
[09:35:20] <JohnResig> there is specific weirdness going on here in IE that's really hard to track down
[09:35:24] <ben_alman> .not('.Item:first')
[09:35:35] <JohnResig> I've seen variations of this issue for years now
[09:35:42] <JohnResig> ben_alman: the actual .not() method works fine
[09:35:42] <addyosmani> is ticket priority going to be discussed in this meeting (as it was just mentioned), or left for another time?
[09:35:50] <JohnResig> addyosmani: in this meeting
[09:35:52] <ben_alman> it just sucks that time has to be spent on non-qsa selectors
[09:35:59] <JohnResig> I agree completely
[09:36:06] <JohnResig> which is why I'm not terribly enthused by this
[09:36:15] <ben_alman> is this a larger problem though?
[09:36:18] <jaubourg> patchwelcome?
[09:36:24] <DaveMethvin> if we leave it borked maybe people will use standard selectors :P
[09:36:28] <ben_alman> like, fuyndamental sizzle bug?
[09:36:57] <JohnResig> I remember weird bugs relating to this even before sizzle
[09:37:07] <JohnResig> it was just weird traversal issues with IE that were hard to pin down
[09:37:25] <DaveMethvin> in the back of my mind i am wondering who will volunteer for this suicide mission
[09:37:32] <ben_alman> i think JohnResig should
[09:37:35] * jaubourg looks at John
[09:37:39] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:37:40] * jaubourg hides
[09:37:42] <addyosmani> there's always that patchwelcome..
[09:37:56] <ben_alman> resigclonewelcome
[09:37:56] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani: +1
[09:38:02] <JohnResig> ha
[09:38:14] <jaubourg> haha, <3 resigclonewelcome
[09:38:35] <jaubourg> patchwelcome and next then?
[09:38:35] <JohnResig> like, right now, I'd be more inclined to rewrite sizzle to extract all the non-qsa selectors and turn them into qsa-compatible stuff then fix that bug
[09:38:39] <JohnResig> so that's saying something
[09:38:39] <DaveMethvin> well you can put it on the list of stufff to look at and we can drop it back off if nobody has time
[09:38:56] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: so it's not a blocker, then
[09:39:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:39:08] <JohnResig> ok
[09:39:14] <ben_alman> +1 complete sizzle rewrite
[09:39:17] <ben_alman> heh
[09:39:17] <ajpiano> it's not like there isn't a workaround
[09:39:27] <ben_alman> ajpiano, yeah, just don't use IE
[09:39:29] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8468
[09:39:41] <JohnResig> similar issue, of sorts
[09:39:45] <JohnResig> only this is a problem with qsa
[09:40:19] <addyosmani> wasn't this mainly an Opera bug?
[09:40:20] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr said it was being addressed by Opera
[09:40:22] <jaubourg> do we have news about any fix Opera-side?
[09:40:31] <jaubourg> k
[09:40:36] <jaubourg> wontfix
[09:40:39] <JohnResig> alright, push to opera
[09:40:40] <ben_alman> ppl should avoid that selector in their code if the yahve opera users?
[09:40:40] <miketaylr> yeah, it's been fixed
[09:40:43] <miketaylr> in CORE
[09:41:03] <DaveMethvin> or upgrade to latest opera that fixes it
[09:41:05] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8921
[09:41:22] <JohnResig> ben_alman: specifically using a comma selector with the right-hand selector including :selected
[09:41:26] <JohnResig> doesn't happen too often
[09:41:40] <ben_alman> JohnResig, heh and standing on your head patting your tummy
[09:41:58] <JohnResig> heh
[09:42:01] <ajpiano> JohnResig: it seems that this and 8909 are inextricably link
[09:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: not specific to :selected
[09:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/286/files
[09:42:50] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: that's not a qsa selector?
[09:42:58] <jaubourg> ok  so we lost timmywil who's the one who -1ed 8921
[09:43:17] <ajpiano> also gnarf explained why it was a problem immediately after to timmy
[09:43:30] <jaubourg> yes, and it makes a LOT of sense
[09:43:39] <ajpiano> like i said, it seems to  part of his cleannup for 8909, which was unanimously +1'd
[09:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: huh? was replying to you saying "right-hand selector including :selected"
[09:43:47] <JohnResig> ajpiano: k
[09:43:53] <ajpiano> well except for jaubourg :p
[09:44:00] <jaubourg> :P
[09:44:08] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: right, what you're pointing to is likely a different bug
[09:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> really?
[09:44:19] <jaubourg> I didn't -1ed it
[09:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> it Opera only
[09:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> extremely similar
[09:44:50] <DaveMethvin> most likely opera isn't throwing ANY exeptions after a comma, even thou it has a custom selector
[09:44:53] <miketaylr> same bug probably, doesn't throw an exception on non-standard pseudo selectors unless they're the first thing passed in
[09:45:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah! :P
[09:45:02] * miketaylr finds bug
[09:45:13] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8951
[09:45:37] <JohnResig> looks like we're making that one not a blocker
[09:45:53] <JohnResig> miketaylr: ah, ok
[09:45:54] <addyosmani> Looks fairly low-priority
[09:46:05] <miketaylr> (querySelectorAll does not throw for an unsupported pseudo-class part of selector if there is a valid part first)
[09:46:27] <JohnResig> k, making 8951 a lower priority
[09:46:39] <DaveMethvin> prio doesn't seem that high i agree, also is there some way to feature detect the issue?
[09:46:41] <miketaylr> (however, fixed in Presto now... so whatever heh)
[09:46:51] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9106
[09:47:08] <rwaldron> i hate this
[09:47:16] <ben_alman> 9106 wat
[09:47:20] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:47:27] <ben_alman> can we kill the submitter
[09:47:34] <JohnResig> yeah, so stupid
[09:47:36] <ben_alman> with an anti-html shiv
[09:47:39] <addyosmani> that looks like it was downboated
[09:47:39] <ben_alman> into the chest
[09:47:46] <rwaldron> its essentially the defaultDisplay bug, but on the html element
[09:47:46] <jaubourg> why on earth did I +1 this?
[09:47:47] <rwaldron> its dumb
[09:47:55] * jaubourg checks what he's smoking
[09:47:58] <addyosmani> perhaps you were drunk, jaubourg :)
[09:48:01] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9399
[09:48:15] <JohnResig> jaubourg: this is your baby
[09:48:19] <jaubourg> ah, touchy
[09:48:31] <jaubourg> I know why I introduced .success and .error
[09:48:50] <jaubourg> but they're confusing because people mix them with deferred semantics
[09:48:55] <ben_alman> i like the relationshipt of jqXHR.success and .error to ajaxOptions success and error
[09:48:58] <ajpiano> how hard is this really to maintain
[09:49:02] <ben_alman> i think it makes it easier for ppl to grok
[09:49:04] <ben_alman> tbh
[09:49:09] <ajpiano> scott, ben, and myself all seem to aggree about ^^
[09:49:13] <jaubourg> it's not hard to maintain, really
[09:49:18] <ben_alman> it just allows them to put 1+1 together
[09:49:19] <jaubourg> it's two affectations
[09:49:36] <DaveMethvin> well like i said in the ticket, it seems like a fast deprecation
[09:49:38] <jaubourg> but it's kind of a mess
[09:49:53] <jaubourg> we encourage people to use done and fail
[09:49:57] <DaveMethvin> we could deprecate now and remove much later
[09:49:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:50:03] <jaubourg> so that they don't get surprised when using $.when
[09:50:10] <ben_alman> jaubourg, makes sense
[09:50:10] <JohnResig> ok, so deprecate - remove later
[09:50:11] <addyosmani> that sounds sensible DaveMethvin.
[09:50:14] <jaubourg> and they don't have success and error
[09:50:29] <ben_alman> too bad .done isn't .pass
[09:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[09:50:38] <ben_alman> symmetry and all w/e
[09:50:44] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7818
[09:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> success and error and such clear names
[09:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> are such...
[09:51:02] <jaubourg> they're not what the deferred semantic means... fail !== error
[09:51:13] <JohnResig> I think we're actually "OK" now for 7818
[09:51:19] <JohnResig> I want to close it as fixed in 1.6
[09:51:49] <ben_alman> so would you use .prop now for plain objects JohnResig ?
[09:51:55] <DaveMethvin> so i forget, what things can have a plain obj passsed to them?
[09:51:58] <ben_alman> $({}).prop('x', 123) ?
[09:52:05] <JohnResig> ben_alman: yeah - and .attr() also works for that as well
[09:52:12] <DaveMethvin> do we still allow .attr for example?
[09:52:13] <jaubourg> I so hate the fact we support this... but meh
[09:52:13] <ben_alman> heh well of course it does :/
[09:52:19] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: attr/prop, animate, bind/unbind
[09:52:35] <ajpiano> like i said, i also don't like the fact that you have to jump between success and ddone
[09:52:44] <ben_alman> it would be nice to have more docs on plain objects passed to $()
[09:53:04] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: yeah this was kind of a placeholder for that
[09:53:18] <DaveMethvin> if it's just the ones john mentioned it should be a short page
[09:53:23] <ben_alman> calling animate on $({}) would be much better done as $.animate tbh
[09:53:25] <JohnResig> ok, so I'll close it as fixed and needsdocs
[09:53:33] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[09:53:53] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8405
[09:54:05] <JohnResig> it doesn't look like anyone cares strongly about this
[09:54:10] <JohnResig> and I think yehuda is quite busy
[09:54:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah turnout was low
[09:54:37] <addyosmani> wontfix?
[09:54:38] <JohnResig> I can close as patchwelcome
[09:54:43] <ajpiano> i like it abstractly, seems like a low priority
[09:54:46] <JohnResig> yeah
[09:54:57] <ben_alman> i still hope we can someday explore subclassing a bit more
[09:54:58] <jaubourg> I can present newInstance as a patch you mean? :P
[09:54:59] <ben_alman> not now tho
[09:55:04] <ajpiano> i think we should take another look at it eventually though
[09:55:09] <ajpiano> not just close wontfix
[09:55:22] <JohnResig> ajpiano: ok, I'll flag for 2.0
[09:55:29] <addyosmani> patchwelcome works too.
[09:55:31] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8792
[09:55:37] <ajpiano> like i said on the ticket, $(".bar", thing) $(".bam", thing) can get tedious
[09:56:02] <ben_alman> iiiinteresting re 8792
[09:56:04] <DaveMethvin> this kinda relates to the other two tix we talked about
[09:56:08] <JohnResig> I totally think that 8792 is feasible, especially if we just turn the global ajax stuff into special events
[09:56:11] <ben_alman> $.support.domData
[09:56:21] <DaveMethvin> but when i looked at it for 1.6 the global events blew it
[09:56:25] <ajpiano> 8792 seems to necessitate rewriting global events, based on what JohnResig and scott_gonzalez said in ticket
[09:56:29] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: special events!
[09:56:36] <JohnResig> it'd be so easy with special events
[09:56:38] <ben_alman> JohnResig, we can't nuke global ajax events?
[09:56:48] <JohnResig> ben_alman: eventually....
[09:56:58] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to deprecate global and move ppl towards $(document).ajaxXXX
[09:57:00] <jaubourg> oh please, nuke them already
[09:57:29] <DaveMethvin> you realize that today you can create an element not even in the document and fire global events on it?? scary
[09:57:45] <JohnResig> ok, how about with morph this bug into "deprecate ajax events"
[09:57:46] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, it truly is global, sweet
[09:57:57] <JohnResig> and revisit this particular bug someday
[09:58:01] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[09:58:03] <ben_alman> are there any benefits to storing all this crap in data?
[09:58:05] <jaubourg> +1
[09:58:11] <addyosmani> +1
[09:58:11] <ben_alman> or is it all just annoying
[09:58:20] <ben_alman> well +1 anyways
[09:58:26] <jaubourg> it's too make things more challenging, ben
[09:58:28] <jaubourg> ;)
[09:58:38] <ajpiano> sounds like we need a new ticket :p
[09:58:39] <JohnResig> next are ben_alman's bugs: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4446
[09:58:47] <JohnResig> wait, right... ben_alman?
[09:58:57] <ben_alman> they aren't mine but they go together
[09:59:07] <ben_alman> that and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4596
[09:59:21] <JohnResig> I definitely want to discuss them separately
[09:59:27] <JohnResig> .findFilter is legit useful
[09:59:30] <ben_alman> yes but i realized that if you implement .andSelf(selector) then you can do $(this).find(selector).andSelf(selector);
[09:59:34] <ben_alman> instead of .findFilter
[09:59:35] <ben_alman> :)
[09:59:50] <ajpiano> i definitely prefer having andSelf("selector") over "findFilter"
[09:59:56] <JohnResig> hmm
[09:59:57] <ajpiano> which is just ASKING for trouble as a method name
[10:00:00] <jaubourg> I have to go, like, right now, all I have to say about new helpers is this: deport them to a plugin, keep the core focussed
[10:00:05] <ben_alman> JohnResig, tell me if my logic is flawed
[10:00:23] <ajpiano> i'm not really a fan of andSelf("selector") though either
[10:00:37] <jaubourg> gotta fly guys, cya around later
[10:00:41] <louisremi> jaubourg: +1
[10:00:41] <ajpiano> but i guess people have made a good case for it
[10:00:44] <JohnResig> ben_alman: no, I think you're good
[10:00:49] <ben_alman> ajpiano, i think it's great. it will save people some writing and it's not like .andSelf() is "pure" in any way
[10:00:50] <ben_alman> really
[10:00:50] <DaveMethvin> both of there are pretty tiny
[10:00:57] <DaveMethvin> these*
[10:01:02] <JohnResig> ok, so andSelf(selector) could be ok, I guess I'm not a huge fan of the current solution
[10:01:10] <ben_alman> if .andSelf() somehow .end()ed the set it would be weird, but it doesn't; it creates a new set
[10:01:14] <JohnResig> so let's do yes andSelf, no findFilter - and for andSelf, think about the API more
[10:01:26] <DaveMethvin> k
[10:01:30] <ben_alman> cool
[10:02:12] <JohnResig> next, outerHTML: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8142
[10:02:15] <JohnResig> noooooooo
[10:02:25] <ajpiano> i'm not sure why you're so opposed to it :p
[10:02:27] <ben_alman> brandon has a plugin for that that i contributed to
[10:02:29] <JohnResig> I'll fight anyone in the thunderdome that tries to land this
[10:02:34] <ben_alman> our solution was pretty robust
[10:02:40] <ajpiano> it seems like your reservation against it is people using it in the way that no one even wants it for
[10:02:57] <addyosmani_> looks like its going to be timmywil vs JohnResig
[10:03:04] <ben_alman> https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-outerhtml/blob/master/jquery.outerhtml.js
[10:03:07] <JohnResig> I can absolutely guarantee that people will abuse this
[10:03:24] <ajpiano> what if it just isn't a setter?
[10:03:24] <JohnResig> they'll use it in place of dom elements
[10:03:40] <ben_alman> yeah we only wrote it as a getter
[10:03:55] <ajpiano> this is just something that comes up with like, alarming regularity
[10:04:01] <addyosmani_> It makes sense as a getter
[10:04:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah not a fan ... ben_alman does that work with table elements in ie?  (Since you're wriapping them in a div)
[10:04:12] <JohnResig> the getter one is the one that I'm against
[10:04:15] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, no idea man
[10:04:18] <ben_alman> probably not?
[10:04:22] <JohnResig> setter doesn't make sense, it's the same as replaceWith
[10:04:31] <ajpiano> right
[10:04:51] <DaveMethvin> i'm gonna drop off in a sec, the plane is landing and they'll shut off the wifi
[10:04:53] <rwaldron> Hypothetic: I guarantee that <24hrs after this is released, we get tickets filed that say: My $(foo).outerHTML("whatever the crap") doesnt set
[10:05:02] <addyosmani_> later DaveMethvin
[10:05:06] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: later!
[10:05:10] <ben_alman> i say -1 on outerhtml
[10:05:18] <rwaldron> bye DaveMethvin
[10:05:19] <addyosmani_> -1 on the whole here too
[10:05:22] <DaveMethvin> -1 outerhtml
[10:05:28] * DaveMethvin  drops landing gear
[10:05:31] <ajpiano> just seems like
[10:05:32] <ben_alman> cya DaveMethvin
[10:05:47] <ajpiano> i donno.
[10:05:51] <JohnResig> so yes, I agree that it can be useful, absolutely - I just think the room for abuse is too high - the reason why people ask for it frequently is because they don't understand the DOM
[10:05:54] <ben_alman> it just seems like, complexity-wise, outerhtml is a lot of work
[10:06:01] <ajpiano> if it can't be done simply
[10:06:02] <ben_alman> to get right across all elements
[10:06:15] <ben_alman> lots of unit tests!
[10:06:22] <ben_alman> unittestswelcome
[10:06:24] <ajpiano> JohnResig: also because they are needing to save html strings for later re-vivification
[10:06:38] <ajpiano> but if the reaon we can't do it is like ben_alman says - complexity, screwing it up on table elements, etc.
[10:06:40] <ajpiano> then that's one thing
[10:06:55] <ajpiano> but there's a lot of things people can do wrong with jQuery - we usually try to doc those things
[10:07:03] <JohnResig> ajpiano: sure - but almost always in those cases you can get away with just storing dom node references
[10:07:08] <rwaldron> also, I can honestly say I've never had a real-world case where i thought "shit man, an outerHTML function would be awesome here"
[10:07:25] <ajpiano> rwaldron: even in building like, all that html and stuff you do for the popcorn export?
[10:07:37] <rwaldron> in Butter?
[10:07:38] <ajpiano> that's the type of situation i'd imagine it having real utility
[10:07:40] <ajpiano> ea
[10:07:40] <ben_alman> rwaldron, i must have, because i created a plugin for it
[10:07:41] <ajpiano> yeah*
[10:07:44] <rwaldron> templates
[10:07:48] <ben_alman> but i don't remember what it was
[10:07:49] <rwaldron> nice try :P
[10:07:57] <rwaldron> <3 ajpiano
[10:08:18] <ajpiano> well
[10:08:19] <ben_alman> i think i was trying to get around an IE bug with absolute vs relative href values or something
[10:08:21] <ben_alman> but it still failed
[10:08:22] <danheberden> rwaldron +1
[10:08:23] <ben_alman> dunnoes
[10:08:25] <ajpiano> i have fought the good fight here
[10:08:26] <ajpiano> :p
[10:08:31] <rwaldron> valiant
[10:08:34] <ajpiano> i don't think i've ever needed it either
[10:08:36] <ben_alman> outerhtml can always be a plugin
[10:08:38] <ajpiano> just... so many people have asked
[10:08:40] <ben_alman> lord knows there are many
[10:08:44] <JohnResig> ajpiano: I know :(
[10:08:59] <JohnResig> can we make a page describing why ouerHTML doesn't need to exist?
[10:09:08] <rwaldron> good idea
[10:09:15] <danheberden> that'd be awesome - api.jquery.com/outerHTML
[10:09:20] <danheberden> "ya,..um... no"
[10:09:21] <ajpiano> haha, let's put it in the api docs as deprecated before it existed
[10:09:22] <rwaldron> "better ways to do what you're trying to do"
[10:09:23] <ajpiano> :p
[10:09:38] <JohnResig> haha, I'm for that :)
[10:09:48] <danheberden> "when good ideas go bad"
[10:09:49] <JohnResig> "New in jQuery 1.7: We removed outerHTML"
[10:10:11] <ben_alman> haha
[10:10:17] <ben_alman> +1
[10:10:19] <JohnResig> now we're getting into the really contenteous bugs
[10:10:20] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5995
[10:10:35] <JohnResig> breaking API, push to 2.0?
[10:10:40] <rwaldron> NO
[10:10:51] <rwaldron> sorry
[10:10:53] <ben_alman> i didn't know what to make of that bug
[10:10:54] <rwaldron> that was dramatic
[10:11:05] <ben_alman> can it, internally use filter and call the internal one swapping the args or something?
[10:11:06] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7194
[10:11:08] <danheberden> rwaldron i'll guess the drama was due to the ticket creator
[10:11:09] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5995#comment:10
[10:11:17] <JohnResig> ben_alman: it'll be a perf hit, most likely
[10:11:22] <ben_alman> well F it
[10:11:25] <rwaldron> danheberden actually, no see my comment
[10:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think .or() reads horribly
[10:11:33] <rwaldron> i didnt even know who the ticket creator was
[10:11:37] <ben_alman> JohnResig, i think .or needs more thought
[10:11:42] <JohnResig> so I think a .or() could be useful eventually, but should be proved as a plugin
[10:11:42] <ben_alman> it's cool, yes
[10:11:47] <ben_alman> JohnResig, +1
[10:11:49] <danheberden> rwaldron i agree
[10:12:09] <ajpiano> my +0 should have been a -1, the semantics of this are so ugly
[10:12:15] <rwaldron> JohnResig ben_alman http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/LNC5m/
[10:12:17] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7523
[10:12:21] <JohnResig> setting outerWidth
[10:12:44] <ben_alman> rwaldron, yours doesn't take into account .end()
[10:12:52] <rwaldron> wooo!
[10:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> for size reference: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L132-174
[10:12:58] <rwaldron> make it so #1
[10:13:34] <JohnResig> hmm
[10:13:46] <JohnResig> that doesn't seem too bad to me
[10:13:54] <JohnResig> anyone opposed to that?
[10:13:55] <ben_alman> rwaldron, like $(sel).or(sel).or(sel).find(other).end() wtf does .end() take you back to anyways?
[10:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> and it'd be even smaller in core
[10:14:01] <ben_alman> which JohnResig
[10:14:05] <ben_alman> 7523?
[10:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> it'd actually be quite a bit smaller in core, at least half the size
[10:14:53] <ben_alman> it would be really sexy to support setters for all the inner/outer width/height variants
[10:15:02] <ben_alman> REALLY sexy
[10:15:21] <JohnResig> yes
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> note that it doesn't support using functions as setters
[10:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> I left that out intentionally
[10:15:44] <ajpiano> i think it would be pretty great to land this in core
[10:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> just use .width()/.height() if you need that
[10:16:00] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez, why not use functions?
[10:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> you wouldn't gain anything with functions here, unless they included the padding/border/margin info
[10:16:20] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9314
[10:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> $.event.fix() ?
[10:16:33] <ben_alman> .innerHeight(function(h){ return h + 10; })); // make the inner height 10px taller
[10:16:34] <JohnResig> vague dom events become jquery events
[10:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: .height(...)
[10:16:48] <JohnResig> julian was the only one in favor
[10:17:10] <gnarf> long meeting
[10:17:11] <ajpiano> julian is also in favour of unicorn puppy races, but like this, they both seem impossible
[10:17:12] <ajpiano> :p
[10:17:13] <JohnResig> and since he folds like a wet paper bag, I say we close it (hehe, jk julian)
[10:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: isn't this exactly what $.event.fix() is?
[10:17:25] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez, hmmn. ok, sure for just + 10 but what if you wanted to * 2? thaere's a difference
[10:17:38] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: probably - although it seems like he wanted it for all events or something vague
[10:17:55] <ben_alman> .innerHeight(function(h){ return h * 2; })); // would this ever be used?
[10:18:00] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9316
[10:18:06] <JohnResig> delegate( null ) becomes bind
[10:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: sure, that actually seems reasonable
[10:18:20] <JohnResig> that one got a MEH from me
[10:18:29] <ajpiano> seemed to get a meh from everyone
[10:18:31] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez, i could see it for innerHeight but i dunno about outerHeight, at least for use-cases
[10:18:33] <ajpiano> my reasonsing is on the ticket
[10:18:38] <JohnResig> ok
[10:18:40] <ajpiano> we don't fix for passing undefined to other methods
[10:18:45] <rwaldron> JohnResig this ticket is precisely what dave's Unify and DRY ticket aims to elminate
[10:18:55] <JohnResig> next: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9386
[10:18:58] <ajpiano> and also dave's solution lets this guy do what he wans
[10:18:59] <ben_alman> rwaldron, +1
[10:19:14] <JohnResig> some random deferreds request
[10:19:15] <ben_alman> .on( optionaldelegateselector, ... )
[10:19:17] * rwaldron nods at ajpiano 
[10:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> we have something similar in UI: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L294-303
[10:19:31] <addyosmani> plugin?
[10:20:02] <JohnResig> addyosmani: yep
[10:20:10] <ajpiano> is it just me or does it seem weird that the deferred that wraps a bunch of deferreds can be resolved before all its sub-deferreds are
[10:20:17] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7441
[10:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> but we don't do what he wants, which is pass all params, but have some undefined
[10:20:18] <ajpiano> as i type that, i realise it doesn't seem that weird.
[10:20:24] <JohnResig> .disable()/.enable()
[10:20:30] <JohnResig> err, .diable() and .check()
[10:20:31] <danheberden> ajpiano heh
[10:20:34] <ajpiano> JohnResig: big time meh.
[10:20:38] <JohnResig> I don't think we need them with the new attr stuff
[10:20:42] <ben_alman> JohnResig, .attr('disabled', true) +1
[10:20:54] <JohnResig> k
[10:21:05] <danheberden> not disable/check please please please
[10:21:05] <ben_alman> i'd say nuke 7441
[10:21:07] <addyosmani> meh + plugin on 7441
[10:21:18] <ben_alman> addyosmani, no plugin needed, just use attr
[10:21:18] <JohnResig> next: oninput: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9121
[10:21:33] <JohnResig> seems like it needs more proof
[10:21:37] <addyosmani> or that. ben_alman's suggestion makes more sense.
[10:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> agreed
[10:21:48] <ajpiano> yup, needs more vetting
[10:22:12] <JohnResig> next: browser.chrome http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9385
[10:22:22] <ajpiano> suppose we should have a 1.8 tag too :p
[10:22:38] <ajpiano> we have to deprecate and remove $.browser or make it work according to users expectations
[10:22:40] <JohnResig> ajpiano: I think we an just use the keywords as a shortcut for that
[10:22:41] <ajpiano> like dave says
[10:22:43] <addyosmani> I would say no. No new additions to it if we're deprecating
[10:22:59] <JohnResig> yeah, no to this, we'll deprecate soon
[10:23:10] <ajpiano> leaving a big lump of useless shit there is even worse than leaving a big lump of vaguely useful shit
[10:23:20] <ajpiano> when is soon?
[10:23:36] <ben_alman> you can't pull it out until ie6 and 7 are totally dead imo
[10:23:37] <danheberden> if we're keeping it core, shouldn't it at least be somewhat thorough?
[10:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> how does adding chrome help?
[10:23:41] <ajpiano> i think moses came down from mount sinai and was like "yo, check out these tablets, ps, we're deprecating $.browser"
[10:23:46] <ben_alman> +1 to adding .chrome
[10:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> wouldn't the version still be the webkit version?
[10:23:51] <addyosmani> At what point do we consider them both dead, though, ben_alman?
[10:23:55] <JohnResig> ajpiano: haha
[10:23:57] <danheberden> ajpiano lol
[10:24:00] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez because chrome is _not_ safari
[10:24:00] <ben_alman> addyosmani, 5-10 years from now tbh
[10:24:12] <rwaldron> but I'm opposed to it anyway
[10:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> so? safari should be Ã¼ber-deprecated
[10:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> $.browser.webkit
[10:24:22] <rwaldron> on the principal that adding to it encourages use
[10:24:23] <ajpiano> i just think that just because WE all know that Browser Sniffing Is Bad
[10:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> already exists
[10:24:24] <JohnResig> OK, so if we're not deprecating then we should add .chrome
[10:24:38] <ajpiano> doens't mean people who don't know that should just be SOL
[10:24:45] <ajpiano> cause we are neglecting it in order to make it useless.
[10:24:49] <ajpiano> ^^ agree
[10:24:52] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez yeah.. but "webkit" is still quite different from chrome
[10:24:59] <rwaldron> have you ever built webkit froim source?
[10:25:06] <JohnResig> right now I have it marked as "Yes, but with stern warnings"
[10:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: sure, but if we add chrome, what version will we report?
[10:25:31] <rwaldron> see above dude, I'm not interested in adding it all
[10:25:39] <addyosmani> are we making the decision that it won't be deprecated? I just feel that updating $.browser at this point might give the impression that our intentions aren't to kill it off soon
[10:25:41] <rwaldron> i'm just saying... i get "why"
[10:25:43] <scott_gonzalez> window.chrome = pretty reliable
[10:25:46] <rwaldron> but i dont endorse
[10:25:51] <rwaldron> that too
[10:25:54] * rwaldron nods
[10:26:00] <danheberden> addyosmani i think a bit "OMG WE'RE DEPRECATING THIS" on the api page might give a hint :p
[10:26:19] <addyosmani> as long as it's in big bold writing, right on ; )
[10:26:20] <JohnResig> we already kind of have that
[10:26:34] <ben_alman> how about instead of depreacteing $.browser we tell people what they should be doing instead of $.browser just like with outerhtml?
[10:26:36] <danheberden> "you will depcreciate that we are deprecating this"
[10:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:26:51] <ajpiano> ben_alman: a bit less cut and dry
[10:27:01] <JohnResig> ben_alman: as we already do
[10:27:05] <ben_alman> wfm
[10:27:08] <JohnResig> and if we do that, then we should have .chrome
[10:27:12] <ben_alman> +1
[10:27:14] <rwaldron> Dear David Mark, Happy Now? We're actually getting rid of it.
[10:27:14] <JohnResig> OK
[10:27:17] <ajpiano> i really think we should just.. have chrome
[10:27:31] <JohnResig> but yeah, we'll need to figure out the version
[10:27:32] <JohnResig> ANYWAY
[10:27:39] <JohnResig> .selector replaced with .selectors: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7389
[10:27:47] <ajpiano> :(((
[10:27:56] <JohnResig> I like this, I think it'll make it way more useful
[10:28:27] <JohnResig> although, I think it should be a different name
[10:28:28] <ajpiano> does it actually change the fundamental problem that some things can't be expressed as a selector??
[10:28:30] <JohnResig> and not just hold selectors
[10:28:35] <ben_alman> i'm going to -1 my own ticket here and say we should do something more like #9469 where we never change the selector after the 1st selection, just pass it through, or don't pass it through at all
[10:28:38] <JohnResig> ajpiano: yes, it does fix it
[10:28:57] <JohnResig> I essentially want to store a stack of methods called with their args
[10:29:01] <ben_alman> and then we can add another prop like .methods or something if we REALLY NEED TO (we don't) that just has method names in the chain (we don't need this)
[10:29:04] <JohnResig> so that people can replay them later
[10:29:06] <addyosmani> ben_alman that sounds like a significantly better idea imo than what's proposed directly in this ticket
[10:29:20] <ben_alman> JohnResig, we don't currently store args, we store a facsimile of them in a string
[10:30:13] <JohnResig> ben_alman: I know!
[10:30:14] <ben_alman> it would probably be easy to write a "debug" plugin that wraps every single traversal/filtering method as well as .pushStack to add method names for debugging
[10:30:19] <JohnResig> which is why I'm proposing this change
[10:30:28] <gnarf> .stack ?
[10:30:32] <JohnResig> gnarf: sure
[10:30:33] <ben_alman> and then streamline pushStack to only accept the new set
[10:30:43] <ben_alman> and remove all that code from core
[10:30:51] <ben_alman> less code in core + debug plugin
[10:31:03] <JohnResig> .stack = [ [ "find", [ "div" ] ], [ "filter", [ Function ] ] ]
[10:31:15] <JohnResig> that way yuo can do the replay
[10:31:19] <JohnResig> it'll be quite useful
[10:31:23] <ben_alman> why not do that in a plugin
[10:31:38] <ben_alman> because right now plugin authors might not be passing 2nd and 3rd args to pushstack
[10:31:38] <JohnResig> ben_alman: because it'd be better to have it baked into core
[10:31:38] <gnarf> as long as jquery knows how to parse the stack later i guess it doesn't matter much... is the idea here to be able to support calling .live() on that second selector?
[10:31:47] <ben_alman> by making it a plugin, you could force this behavior
[10:32:06] <JohnResig> ok, I'll explore this a bit and see if we can make some minor tweaks and deprecate .selector
[10:32:29] <ben_alman> JohnResig, i'd be happy to talk thru some ideas with you and dave, we had already talked about it extensively
[10:32:44] <JohnResig> k
[10:32:49] <JohnResig> ok. last one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9347
[10:33:04] <JohnResig> alright ajpiano
[10:33:19] <ben_alman> wait
[10:33:27] <ajpiano> i mean like, obvs i would also use a wrapper here
[10:33:30] <ben_alman> $.load or $.fn.load
[10:33:40] <ajpiano> i just think it's weird that the promise of a $.fn.load is completely unaccessible
[10:33:44] <ajpiano> even though it's "there"
[10:33:53] <ajpiano> you can get it from $.get etc, which are all very much convenience methods
[10:34:05] <JohnResig> can we treat it like .animate()
[10:34:12] <ajpiano> that's kind of what i was getting at
[10:34:17] <ben_alman> what if $.fn.load stored the jqXHR in data on the element $('div').load('url').data('ajax-load')
[10:34:26] <danheberden> ajpiano doesn't it work like that now?
[10:34:39] <danheberden> $.when( $('whatever').load('url' ).done(...
[10:34:53] <JohnResig> ok, I'm pro-this if it does what .animate() does
[10:35:11] <ajpiano> i'm not sure, but according to jaubourg
[10:35:12] <ben_alman> what if you're animating an element that has ajax loaded into it
[10:35:22] <ben_alman> when is it done?
[10:35:29] * JohnResig shrugs
[10:35:33] <ajpiano> "For instance, by default element.promise() is equivalent to element.promise( "fx" )"
[10:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't like this for animate and I don't like it for load
[10:35:50] <JohnResig> heh
[10:35:53] <JohnResig> ajpiano: oof
[10:36:02] <JohnResig> ok, let's drop this
[10:36:09] <ben_alman> by attaching promises to jquery objects, we're potentially limiting ourselves down the road
[10:36:16] <JohnResig> if julian ever gets excited by it, we can revisit
[10:36:31] <ben_alman> unless there's a specific prop like collection.animate or collection.ajax that is the promise
[10:36:39] <danheberden> it's there
[10:36:42] <danheberden> for .load
[10:36:50] <ben_alman> collection.animate.promise()
[10:36:52] <danheberden> lemme write a better example
[10:37:08] <ben_alman> collection.promise() -> what possible async thing is that promising?
[10:37:19] <JohnResig> ok, so we've accepted 41 tickets, if I counted correctly
[10:37:22] <JohnResig> rejected 40
[10:37:34] <ajpiano> i don't think promise("ajax") is that bad but ya
[10:37:44] <JohnResig> at some point this week I'll go through and assign them all to the right milestone and close them - unless someone else wants to help me
[10:37:47] <JohnResig> (I would appreciate it)
[10:37:57] <rwaldron> I'll help
[10:38:08] <JohnResig> rwaldron: awesome, thanks - ask me if you have any questions
[10:38:13] <rwaldron> Just will do
[10:38:18] <rwaldron> whoops
[10:38:22] <JohnResig> we've gone on for long enough, not sure if we have time for anything else
[10:38:50] <rwaldron> that was going to be "just make a list", then i realized this list was sufficient 0_o
[10:39:00] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: if the closure guys are here, tell them that if they fix it so that jQuery works with adv options, we'll be inclined to use it
[10:39:10] <rwaldron> hahaha
[10:39:17] <ChadHikes> There'd be a little more too it than that
[10:39:41] <JohnResig> speak of the devil!
[10:39:45] <JohnResig> ChadHikes: ?
[10:40:03] <ChadHikes> ChadHikes - > Chad Killingsworth. Member of the Closure-Compiler team
[10:40:35] <ben_alman> JohnResig, vs uglify?
[10:40:37] <louisremi> If we have enhancement requests now, will we have to wait for 1.8?
[10:40:39] <JohnResig> nice - but yeah, let us know what needs to go where
[10:40:43] <rwaldron> Welcome ChadHikes
[10:40:47] <ChadHikes> Thanks
[10:40:49] <JohnResig> louisremi: yep
[10:41:06] <JohnResig> louisremi: well, depending upon the enhancement, I guess
[10:41:17] <ajpiano> ben_alman: it's not really that we ourselves definitely would change, it's more just making it possible for jquery to be run through CC with adavanced
[10:41:27] <ben_alman> ajpiano, well that would be nice
[10:41:28] <JohnResig> right, what ajpiano said
[10:41:34] <JohnResig> OK
[10:41:42] <JohnResig> ChadHikes: keep in touch, let us know if you have any questions
[10:41:44] <JohnResig> OK
[10:41:48] <JohnResig> I think that's it everyone
[10:41:52] <ajpiano> whew*
[10:41:53] <ajpiano> !!
[10:42:02] <JohnResig> THANKS EVERYONE!
[10:42:06] <ben_alman> thx u
[10:42:17] <JohnResig> we'll assign people to issues next week
[10:42:22] <JohnResig> and get it sorted out
[10:42:31] <louisremi> alright
[10:42:34] <JohnResig> if you want to claim one, go to town
[10:42:41] <JohnResig> alright - have a good week everyone!
