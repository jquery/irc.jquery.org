[08:59:50] <danheberden> :p
[08:59:53] <gnarf> danheberden is an evil dictator
[09:00:09] <danheberden> i try really hard to be, at least
[09:00:24] <jzaefferer> did someone do the twitter announcement?
[09:00:32] <danheberden> for 1.8.13?
[09:00:36] <danheberden> or the meeting
[09:00:39] <jzaefferer> meeting
[09:00:47] <jzaefferer> Ralph did 1.8.13 afaik
[09:01:01] <danheberden> i didn't see one about the meeting
[09:01:21] <ajpiano> i can do it  now :p
[09:01:26] <jzaefferer> go for it!
[09:01:26] <danheberden> .tweet jqueryui
[09:01:28] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/kN2iL7 @jqueryui: jQuery UI 1.8.13 Released http://bit.ly/jPhaeJ
[09:01:33] <gnarf> do it now!!! get to the choppa!!!!
[09:01:34] <danheberden> doooooooooo it
[09:02:07] <jzaefferer> alright, today's agenda actually looks different then that of the last two weeks, at least when you scroll down a bit: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[09:02:29] <danheberden> its so big
[09:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> twss
[09:02:44] <danheberden> ?hi5 scott_gonzalez
[09:02:45] <bot-t> ⁵ scott_gonzalez
[09:02:52] <jzaefferer> okay, Scott is back, so let's get started
[09:03:17] <jzaefferer> I couldn't find any -git.js links on jqueryui.com
[09:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> I added the jquery-ui-git links
[09:03:21] <jzaefferer> so still open, right?
[09:03:28] <jzaefferer> where exactly?
[09:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> on the homepage, sidebar (Developer Links): master/WIP build (theme)
[09:04:07] <jzaefferer> I see
[09:04:13] <jzaefferer> can we duplicate those to http://jqueryui.com/development ?
[09:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> where?
[09:05:01] <jzaefferer> sidebar?
[09:05:04] <danheberden> maybe right after teh "jquery ui is on github" part?
[09:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:05:38] <danheberden> also, on this topic
[09:05:43] <danheberden> what about the jquery cdn
[09:05:48] <danheberden> do you wnat to advertise that?
[09:06:09] <jzaefferer> are our releases on there now?
[09:06:13] <danheberden> 1.8.13 is
[09:06:21] <jzaefferer> that's something
[09:06:32] <danheberden> getting all the themes up is a pita :/
[09:06:47] <jzaefferer> ah, there's actually an index now: http://code.jquery.com/
[09:06:57] <jzaefferer> not themed by Doug :p
[09:07:07] <danheberden> yeah, if you go to index.html it looks a _little_ better
[09:07:19] <danheberden> cache will catch up eventually
[09:07:55] <danheberden> but yeah, no doug-esqueness
[09:08:13] <danheberden> tried to get a really cool glossy 3d icon for it
[09:08:14] <danheberden> just for him
[09:08:26] <jzaefferer> well, as long as code.jquery.com doesn't serve content with propery expires headers, I'd rather have people use proper CDNs
[09:08:45] <jzaefferer> all I see is an ETag and Last-Modified
[09:08:52] <jzaefferer> not good enough
[09:09:02] <danheberden> mt tries :/ heh
[09:09:11] <danheberden> but yeah, i'm cool just pushing googles
[09:09:20] <jzaefferer> can we do something about that?
[09:09:26] <danheberden> unfortunately no
[09:09:31] <danheberden> wel
[09:09:35] <danheberden> we can talk to them about it
[09:09:40] <danheberden> and ask them to improve their cdn
[09:09:53] <jzaefferer> considering that jQuery itself is heavily advertising that
[09:09:56] <jzaefferer> we should do that
[09:09:59] <danheberden> but the same issue exists with content-headers too
[09:10:16] <danheberden> jzaefferer we'll see, they're getting odd about it
[09:10:25] <danheberden> but that discussion is better to have in skype
[09:10:30] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:10:45] <jzaefferer> include the infrastructure list if you email them, I'll see that, too
[09:11:00] <danheberden> well it's more eboard stuff ya konw?
[09:11:08] <jzaefferer> so nothing new on Jenkins, here's hoping JD gets back to that sometime soon
[09:11:12] <dougneiner_> hey jzaefferer
[09:11:22] <jzaefferer> hey doug, thanks for joining :-)
[09:11:36] <dougneiner_> np :)
[09:11:43] <danheberden>   /kick dougneiner_
[09:11:50] <jzaefferer> danheberden, anything else on infra? view.jqueryui.com, hotlinking, swarm?
[09:11:53] <dougneiner_> I love you too danheberden
[09:12:11] <danheberden> jzaefferer not really - swarm stuff is part of the (mt) plans/talks
[09:12:15] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:12:16] <danheberden> looking to get someone on view
[09:12:23] <danheberden> was thinking eddie, but he keeps dissapearing
[09:12:24] <jzaefferer> anyone in particular?
[09:12:27] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:12:35] <danheberden> but a new guy that helped with the logging
[09:12:42] <danheberden> he's been realy helpful
[09:12:47] <danheberden> so ya, i think i'm covered
[09:12:50] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:13:02] * gnarf taps danheberden on the shoulder
[09:13:08] <jzaefferer> so I can't tell if there's been anything going on with MS P+P
[09:13:18] <danheberden> gnarf but you're doing so much bad-assness with effects and color
[09:13:21] <gnarf> not that I don't have enough to do already, but if you need some more help ;)
[09:13:23] <jzaefferer> in general I'd say we should get the Widget Factory on jqueryui.com asap
[09:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be starting to review the P+P code this afternoon
[09:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> they project is pretty big
[09:13:46] <jzaefferer> basically everytime I talk to people that know about jQuery UI, they know nothing of the widget factory
[09:13:52] <ajpiano> i spoke to don last night
[09:14:06] <ajpiano> he said he's gonna have a chapter on the WF for us to look at by the end of the week
[09:14:13] <rosshadden> I LOVE the factory. Depend on it even
[09:14:14] <jzaefferer> WF?
[09:14:22] <ajpiano> widget factory?
[09:14:24] <danheberden> haha
[09:14:26] <jzaefferer> err
[09:14:29] <jzaefferer> right
[09:14:30] <ajpiano> :p
[09:14:33] <danheberden> QUIT THROWING AROUND USELESS ACRONYMS
[09:14:37] <jzaefferer> context!!!!1
[09:14:39] <RTPMatt> hah
[09:14:51] <danheberden> so ms p+p is seperate from teh ui docs stuff?
[09:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I are not so good with the acronyms
[09:14:59] <danheberden> i'm not, um, entirely up to speed on what the hell it is
[09:15:06] <danheberden> (though technically and initialism)
[09:15:10] <danheberden> *an initialism
[09:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: it's double-sided
[09:15:17] <ajpiano> danheberden: we are trying to use some of their materials for docs
[09:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> initialisms are acronyms which are abbreviations
[09:15:33] <ajpiano> and also ensure that when they put the material out, it is high quality information
[09:15:45] <danheberden> ajpiano so is that going into the wiki for now?
[09:15:57] <danheberden> or into the mediawiki stuffs
[09:16:01] <ajpiano> just the wiki
[09:16:04] <danheberden> whew
[09:16:28] <jzaefferer> I added some acronyms to the agenda outcome column
[09:16:41] <danheberden> f7u12!!!!
[09:16:57] <danheberden> <3z
[09:17:20] <jzaefferer> so, in general, do we want to make the WF a top-level components, e.g. next to position as a utility?
[09:17:38] <danheberden> that has my vote
[09:17:41] <jzaefferer> we could just create a placeholder for now, to go out with the next 1.8.x release
[09:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[09:17:45] <jzaefferer> and link the the wiki page
[09:17:45] <danheberden> as much as we tote it
[09:17:55] <jzaefferer> then redesign that when we redesign the entire site
[09:18:04] <danheberden> ya
[09:18:14] <danheberden> ajpiano?
[09:18:20] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: yes, i think that is a great idea
[09:18:28] <jzaefferer> can we get away with changes in the demo folder? or does that require some changes to the site? scott_gonzalez?
[09:18:33] <danheberden> since he's the WFBA (widget factory bad ass)
[09:18:55] <gnarf> +1 on widget factory
[09:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: what do you mean?
[09:19:22] <jzaefferer> well, it probably isn't
[09:19:37] <jzaefferer> how to we get the Widget Factory to show up on jqueryui.com/demos/widgetfactory
[09:19:37] <danheberden> jzaefferer you mean to have some demos for WF?
[09:19:37] <jzaefferer> ?
[09:19:53] <danheberden> pretty sure it's just a static list
[09:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[09:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> not sure if it comes from the git repo or not
[09:20:05] <jzaefferer> well, we could even have a default demo with a demo widget
[09:20:15] <jzaefferer> otherwise can we just add a Docs link?
[09:20:23] <jzaefferer> no idea how that works, either :/
[09:20:31] <danheberden> ya - it's killing the "it trying to pull from docs.jquery.com" thing
[09:20:33] <jzaefferer> or a link on /demos
[09:20:46] <ajpiano> not sure how it works from a technical perspective, but just a link to docs from the top level would be fine for now
[09:21:00] <danheberden> that might be the only option
[09:21:15] <jzaefferer> okay, we need to figure that out, Adam, can you keep that on your plate and nag the right people?
[09:21:33] <ajpiano> who am i nagging, dan?
[09:21:40] <ajpiano> :p
[09:21:51] <jzaefferer> dan, scott, me
[09:21:55] <danheberden> one quick thing - where the hell is the site?
[09:21:56] <ajpiano> my pleasure
[09:22:03] <danheberden> the repo just shows an initial commit from 1.19
[09:22:06] <danheberden> is it in svn still?
[09:22:11] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:22:13] <danheberden> ugh
[09:22:22] <jzaefferer> needs to die
[09:22:25] <jzaefferer> but not today
[09:22:36] <jzaefferer> anything on Effects Docs?
[09:22:38] <jzaefferer> gnarf?
[09:22:55] <danheberden> jzaefferer i recommended we wait for richard on the xml needs of it
[09:22:58] <gnarf> I have started putting together a list of options, but haven't gotten very far
[09:23:17] <jzaefferer> on an almost unrelated note, anyone here that is interested in getting Tooltip done? got works to do on demos, tests and docs
[09:23:18] <gnarf> I wanna talk with richard re: how I should properly xmlify them
[09:23:37] <jzaefferer> okay, let's do that on Monday
[09:24:05] <jzaefferer> Monday, 23rd, 1pm EST -> UI docs meeting here
[09:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> I can work on tooltip
[09:24:17] <jzaefferer> or maybe in Skype
[09:24:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, start by getting Adam to update his tests update
[09:24:52] <ajpiano> haha yea sorry about that
[09:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: update your tests pull
[09:24:56] <jzaefferer> I've got some ideas for composite demos, need to write those down
[09:25:01] <ajpiano> i started fixing those tests then i managed to poop all over my repo
[09:25:18] <jzaefferer> noice
[09:25:35] <ajpiano> feels like yesterday, has been a week:
[09:25:36] <ajpiano> :/
[09:25:53] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:25:55] <jzaefferer> we'll get there
[09:26:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, anything on Download Builder rewrite?
[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> no, we're waiting on the front-end/back-end meeting
[09:26:29] <dougneiner_> I'd like to say this meeting lacks the excitedment of when it was on Skype
[09:26:50] <dougneiner_> scott_gonzalez: I'll email Yehuda right now and cc you and richard
[09:26:50] * scott_gonzalez agrees
[09:26:58] <ajpiano> sorry guys,
[09:27:05] <jzaefferer> doug, we can open a backchannel to make you make excited
[09:27:10] <ajpiano> [insert joke about bad grammar in bugs]
[09:27:12] <danheberden> hahaha
[09:27:18] <ajpiano> :p
[09:27:21] * danheberden hugs dougneiner_
[09:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok, CSS stuff...
[09:28:02] <jzaefferer> dougneiner_, cc me too plz
[09:28:11] <jzaefferer> or just ui-dev
[09:28:22] <jzaefferer> (the olde google group list)
[09:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-widget :active { outline: none; } is super slow
[09:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6757
[09:28:37] <jzaefferer> todd_, are you around?
[09:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> scottjehl: you too
[09:28:50] <dougneiner_> jzaefferer: too late
[09:28:55] <dougneiner_> i'll forward it to you
[09:29:08] <jzaefferer> alright
[09:29:13] <jzaefferer> hey, scottjehl is here
[09:29:16] <dougneiner_> sent && forwarded
[09:29:37] <jzaefferer> so yeah, what can we do instead of the :active thing?
[09:29:39] * dougneiner_ hugs danheberden back
[09:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> why are we removing the outline in the first place?
[09:30:13] <danheberden> to remove the dotted selection thingy
[09:30:26] <danheberden> like on tabs 'n stuff, ya?
[09:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I know what it's doing, I don't know why we're doing it thoug
[09:31:46] <danheberden> dots are ugly
[09:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> and we do get outlines on tabs
[09:32:12] <danheberden> (maybe tabs was a bad example)
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> so then the user can turn off outlines
[09:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> we get outlines pretty much everywhere
[09:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> like the rule doesn't even work
[09:33:23] <danheberden> well there's :active outline and :focus outline
[09:33:30] <jzaefferer> sounds like we should remove it, and figure out what, if anything, we should actually do
[09:33:44] <danheberden> dougneiner_ any css godlike feedback on this?
[09:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so what gets an active outline?
[09:35:12] <dougneiner_> yeah, I'd be curious what we use it for
[09:35:24] <dougneiner_> simply scoping it to known elements would probably help as well
[09:35:30] <gnarf> the "a" links
[09:35:33] <gnarf> for tabs
[09:35:36] <dougneiner_> its the implied * that is making the selctor slow
[09:35:42] <dougneiner_> I think
[09:35:57] <gnarf> would be my guess
[09:36:00] <gnarf> but its just a guess
[09:36:32] <danheberden> we should tweet that as "here's a bug to fix for rewardjs!"
[09:36:46] <gnarf> :)
[09:36:57] <dougneiner_> no no, gimme gimme
[09:36:58] <dougneiner_> :D
[09:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> so can we just delete it?
[09:37:25] <dougneiner_> I fixed a bug the other day that was created on purpose by scott mass deleting files
[09:37:28] <dougneiner_> :P
[09:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:37:35] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i think we'll want to at least run through some trials on it, ya?
[09:37:47] <dougneiner_> Spent like 1.5 hours recreating index pages that were intentionally deleted
[09:37:57] <dougneiner_> last time I fix a "bug" without discussing it w/ someone
[09:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like if people care about this, they're doing it in their own CSS anyway
[09:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> since ours is limited to our widgets
[09:39:37] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez but not globally
[09:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> what do you mean not globally?
[09:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure if people care about this, they're doing it globally themselves
[09:40:20] <danheberden> i typically target the elements showing the outline
[09:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> probably with a { outline: none; }
[09:40:45] <danheberden> so if ui could do that itself, i'd be for that
[09:41:20] <jzaefferer> what if people want to keep the outlines?
[09:42:17] <danheberden> i think that'd be the rare case
[09:42:29] <danheberden> in which case they can add it back in
[09:42:42] <danheberden> but if http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[09:42:54] <ajpiano> i don't think we should be putting such a gneeric rule in
[09:42:54] <danheberden> has outlines around the text, imho it'd look ugly
[09:43:04] <danheberden> ajpiano ya, just target the elements
[09:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: it does
[09:43:11] <danheberden> .ui-tab-nav a { outline: none; }
[09:43:19] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez not for me? just .active class?
[09:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, I keep talking about focus
[09:44:52] <danheberden> well sounds like y'all got an idea as to whats best, so i'll just trust ya :)
[09:44:52] <gnarf> a's and inputs are the only things that pick  up :active right?
[09:45:33] <gnarf> we got like 15 minutes for the rest of the items on the agenda btw
[09:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I think we need to focus specific elements
[09:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> like we should apply this to .ui-tabs-nav a, but not .ui-tabs a
[09:46:02] <danheberden> correct
[09:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll update the ticket
[09:46:26] <danheberden> just things like tabs/accordion/datepicker where having the outline when you've clicked it
[09:46:29] <danheberden> would look kinda silly
[09:47:06] <danheberden> plus, there is .ui-state-active a { outline:none} :/
[09:47:14] <gnarf> hrm
[09:47:21] <gnarf> i wonder if its just during the "transition"
[09:47:28] <gnarf> that might be why its there
[09:47:33] <danheberden> ya
[09:48:03] <gnarf> ie8 opacity?
[09:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> let's jump down a bit
[09:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9m5 will go out this week
[09:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> we still need to try to switch fx -> show/hide
[09:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> but we'll do 1.9m5 without that
[09:49:14] <scott_gonzalez> pull requests
[09:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> Jörn and I went though a bunch this morning
[09:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> still need a lot more help
[09:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> over 30 open pull requests
[09:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> there were over 50 this morning
[09:50:14] <danheberden> sounds like rewardjs is working?
[09:50:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: wee!!!!
[09:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> if anyone has time to review pull requests, please do so
[09:50:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if i happen to miss an effects related one - feel free to @gnarf37 comment on the pull :)
[09:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> just make sure you let one of us know since we don't get notified for comments if we haven't commented
[09:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: will do
[09:51:14] <jzaefferer> yeah, so even just checking if the commit message is formatted properly helps a lot
[09:51:24] <ajpiano> is it possible to get an RSS feed of PRs
[09:51:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: i don't think so - but there is an API
[09:52:02] <gnarf> We could prolly turn it into an RSS
[09:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> pubsubhubbub?
[09:52:23] <danheberden> ajpiano: just put https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls in your reader
[09:52:37] <danheberden> e.g. google pulls it in just fine
[09:52:42] <gnarf> awesome
[09:52:47] <gnarf> lets see if apple mail doe
[09:52:47] <gnarf> s
[09:52:49] <ajpiano> sounds good!
[09:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok, ARIA hackathon
[09:53:35] <jzaefferer> danheberden, that gets converted to /commits
[09:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> does anyone know if Google or Opera were contacted?
[09:53:41] <jzaefferer> so not so helpful for pulls
[09:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> I emailed Microsoft, haven't gotten a response yet
[09:53:45] <danheberden> jzaefferer ugh :(
[09:53:53] <gnarf> danheberden: when i put the pull request url into apple mail, i get commits
[09:53:59] <danheberden> :(
[09:54:12] <jzaefferer> I contacted eventmobi, that's it, dunno of anything else
[09:54:43] <jzaefferer> still need to reply to Felix
[09:54:55] <danheberden> so which days are what?
[09:55:05] <danheberden> txjs is on the 11th :/
[09:55:37] <jzaefferer> bad timing
[09:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> 11th and 12th are the main days
[09:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> will continue through the 15th
[09:56:13] <danheberden> k
[09:57:21] <jzaefferer> ping Paul Irish?
[09:57:55] <jzaefferer> maybe Marc Grabanski, he's not that for off from Toronto and got good contacts, see his dayofjs conf at google hq
[09:58:48] <gnarf> before we close down, can I ask opinion on a few effects issues? :)
[09:58:54] <jzaefferer> Adam, could you contact Paul? I'll contact Marc
[09:59:06] <todd_> Hey all, I'm here now sorry!
[09:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I can send you some info
[09:59:35] <ajpiano> yeah, send it along, i'll see if paul can do anything
[09:59:52] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:00:23] <jzaefferer> looks like boris isn't here yet, let's just go on a bit before we go on with grid
[10:00:29] <gnarf> jstroem's split effects are pretty much ready to get pulled in IMO - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/185 - This new version of "explode" could potentially just replace our current "explode" -- Do you think we should perhaps rename .split.js to .explode.js (throw out our old) and just also include pinwheel/blockfade/etc there?
[10:00:51] <jzaefferer> whats pinwheel/blockfade?
[10:01:08] <gnarf> gnarf.net/jquery-ui/tests/visual/effects.all.html
[10:01:14] <gnarf> http://gnarf.net/jquery-ui/tests/visual/effects.all.html
[10:01:19] <gnarf> bottom
[10:01:26] <jzaefferer> ah
[10:01:29] <jzaefferer> oh well
[10:01:32] <gnarf> build - pinwheel - blockfade - shear - sexplode are new "split" effects
[10:01:42] <gnarf> sexplode has random turned on atm
[10:01:45] <jzaefferer> I don't really think we should we adding even more effects
[10:01:55] <gnarf> they are nice nice effects
[10:02:20] <danheberden> gnarf what's the size increase on them?
[10:02:22] <danheberden> roughly
[10:02:46] <gnarf> um, hard for me to calculate in my current detached head
[10:02:49] <gnarf> but i can get that info
[10:03:03] <gnarf> jstroem: you know?
[10:03:06] <jstroem> is it compressed or uncompressed?
[10:03:07] <jzaefferer> todd_, if you look at the agenda, there are the items between :active { outline: none } and Dialog height during drag that we'd appreciate your input on
[10:03:11] <gnarf> how big is split.js after you minify
[10:03:17] <todd_> ok
[10:03:24] <danheberden> jstroem well we really only care about compressed for, like, increased file-size
[10:03:46] <jstroem> yea okay. i could look into that..
[10:03:50] <jzaefferer> if those are seperate files, I'm not worrying about codesize too much
[10:04:29] <danheberden> lets keep that convo going in #jqueryui-dev
[10:04:35] <danheberden> since borismoore is here, ya?
[10:04:37] <jzaefferer> replacing existing ones with better implementations sounds fine
[10:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> file size shouldn't be a concern since each effect is listed out on the download builder
[10:04:46] <jstroem> each effect could easly be seperated out into different files
[10:04:55] <gnarf> right now they are all in .split.js
[10:04:55] <danheberden> then inclusion shoudln't be a big deal, ya?
[10:05:29] <jzaefferer> well, let's defer that / have that discussion in #jqueryui-dev
[10:05:34] <gnarf> k
[10:05:44] <jstroem> they have some common functions but that could be pushed into effects.core.js and then a new file for each of the new effects?
[10:05:58] <gnarf> text effects - if we want them for 1.9 I was gonna try to fill jstroem in on them - but we can move to ui-dev
[10:06:23] <jstroem> is the text effects the same as paul_irish has on his lazy request?
[10:06:28] <gnarf> jstroem: yeah
[10:06:46] <jstroem> acctually i have been looking in to them some time ago..
[10:06:46] <jzaefferer> alright, so let's get started with grid
[10:07:06] <jstroem> i could rewrite them so it matches the jquery-ui setup
[10:08:01] <jzaefferer> if you haven't seen it yet, we've started the list of component to work on for Stage 3 Custom Inputs: wiki.jqueryui.com/Grid-CustomInputs
[10:08:21] <todd_> jzaefferer - the IE8 CSS filters are a good idea to add. i noted in the agenda
[10:08:24] <jzaefferer> so several new components, as mentioned there: "Of these, Selectmenu, Mask, Checkbox and Radiobutton are to be created from scratch, Datepicker to be rewritten (existing prototype), Autocomplete and Spinner polished."
[10:08:30] <jzaefferer> thanks todd_
[10:08:33] <todd_> jzaefferer - what is the toolbar demo link again
[10:08:51] <jzaefferer> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/toolbar.html
[10:09:23] <jzaefferer> for none of those components we have to start completely from scratch, as we have at least prototypes lying around somewhere
[10:09:31] <todd_> ...so that's what this relates to? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/265/files
[10:10:23] <jzaefferer> borismoore, any idea when you get to the pager control?
[10:10:52] <borismoore> I think I need to look at the diff on templates for Mike Samuel's work first
[10:11:09] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:11:12] <borismoore> I put some current tasks I am working on here:
[10:11:18] <borismoore> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid Status and tasks
[10:11:31] <jzaefferer> there's even an id for that: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#StatusandTasks
[10:11:39] <borismoore> So it  would be end of next week probably
[10:11:41] <jzaefferer> so template, then pager?
[10:11:57] <borismoore> Unless I move the priorities to front load it
[10:12:14] <JohnAyers> is the datamodel pretty much baked?
[10:12:42] <borismoore> Data model is pretty orthogonal to Grid in my view
[10:12:55] <borismoore> Grid should not depend on it directly
[10:12:58] <jzaefferer> so the sorting, paging, filtering stuff is in a very good state - we even have an update on the preloader, though that mostly shows that its hard to create a reusable preloader with out current design
[10:13:17] <jzaefferer> its not that much of a priority, so if someone is interested in investigating that..
[10:13:22] <borismoore> Yes, for the datasource part of data model - SPF
[10:13:33] <jzaefferer> otherwise the datamodel work will continue as part of Stage 3 Editing
[10:13:56] <jzaefferer> getting started with that end of the week
[10:14:00] <borismoore> I would like to include some review of datasource as part of looking at the pager
[10:14:42] <vmitnick> For next week's meeting, John Brinkman from Adobe would like to talk about some work he's beeing doing with data models
[10:14:44] <todd_> jzaefferer - most of those changes to toolbar seem ok, but I wish he explained the issues he was trying to solve and on what browsers, looks like IE issues in some cases. No ticket for this? Anyway, I left a few comments. The first padding edit and the zoom:1 are both safe, just not sure what the other two tweaks are for. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/265/files
[10:14:47] <brado23> I'd like to take a closer look at this preloader.
[10:14:54] <vmitnick> could we get him on the agenda?
[10:14:56] <jzaefferer> borismoore, before or after you worked on the extended pager?
[10:15:23] <jzaefferer> vmitnick, sure, though if he could share something before the actual meeting, that would probably be a lot more productive
[10:15:47] <borismoore> jzaefferer: You mean looking at datasource?
[10:15:59] <jzaefferer> borismoore, yeah, the review you mention
[10:16:02] <borismoore> I'd be happy to do it first
[10:16:07] <borismoore> before pager
[10:16:07] <vmitnick> @jzaefferer> - who should he talk to?
[10:16:29] <borismoore> But pager will depend on it
[10:16:33] <jzaefferer> brado23, good! What I'm hoping for is a reusable component that can wrap a remote datasource, and handles the preloading at least for paging
[10:17:13] <jzaefferer> vmitnick, in general #jqueryui-dev - otherwise contact Richard or me
[10:17:18] <brado23> Yes, I remembered that topic from a few weeks back...I didn't realize you'd invested in a preloader...happy to look closer.
[10:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be looking into the preloader as well
[10:17:32] <jzaefferer> borismoore, anything specific that you're looking for in a review?
[10:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> what I found was that the localDatasource couldn't be used as a wrapper
[10:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> but we can probably create something specifically meant to wrap a remote datasource
[10:18:08] <jzaefferer> if the preloader handles only paging, reusing localDatasource doesn't provide that much value anyway
[10:18:17] <borismoore> I had some thoughts based on looking at it already. I can best present them in the context of looking at pager I think
[10:19:18] <jzaefferer> borismoore, could you put that on the Grid-SPF wiki page, on the open issues list?
[10:19:28] <borismoore> Sure
[10:19:55] <todd_> jzaefferer  - I asked scottjehl to take a look at the dialog pull request agenda item to see if he has any ideas. I'm stumped.
[10:20:57] <jzaefferer> todd_, okay, thanks
[10:21:56] <jzaefferer> alright, unless someone has input on all the TODOs we have (as outlined on Grid page), I'd like to discuss intergrations
[10:22:09] <jzaefferer> in the original roadmap we didn't really take integration of the various components into account
[10:22:27] <jzaefferer> for example, the grid-markup work from Stage 1 is currently not at all integrated with anything else
[10:22:52] <jzaefferer> with all the components still upcoming, I wonder if it could make sense to define a Stage 5 - Integration
[10:23:04] <jzaefferer> at which point we'll have all the individual pieces
[10:23:10] <jzaefferer> any thoughts on that?
[10:23:17] <borismoore> Makes sense to me
[10:23:26] <borismoore> It's important
[10:23:50] <jzaefferer> so +1 on Stage 5?
[10:24:07] <ajpiano> that certainly makes sense
[10:24:14] <brado23> sure
[10:24:20] <borismoore> Also, part of that can be looking at end-to-end scenarios to confirm what coverage/wholes we have
[10:24:26] <borismoore> holes
[10:24:59] <borismoore> - best practice patterns for using grid etc.
[10:25:00] <jzaefferer> there are going to be endless small ones - the goal is to cover the big ones and make it possible to later cover small ones as well :-)
[10:25:40] <borismoore> Yeah, it won't ever be complete, but at least some level of sanity testing and best practice for main scenarios
[10:25:55] <jzaefferer> yeah, okay
[10:27:14] <jzaefferer> so, considering that those involved are already pretty busy, any ideas on recruiting?
[10:27:30] <jzaefferer> do you know other's that could help? or have ideas on how we could do better on recruiting?
[10:28:08] <jzaefferer> we want to have enough velocity to keep the project going even when the funding runs out
[10:28:59] <jzaefferer> btw. as I can't tell who's actually looking the agenda, I'm taking notes there: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[10:29:11] <jzaefferer> down at line 64 is the grid section
[10:31:11] <jzaefferer> so yeah, if you've got any input on that, let us know next week, or on #jqueryui-dev, or ping me or Richard (rworth, online next week again)
[10:32:07] <jzaefferer> well, that's it for today then
[10:32:42] <daviferreira> quit
[10:33:20] <gnarf> your grid meeting was much quicker :)
[10:33:59] <jzaefferer> that's how we roll
