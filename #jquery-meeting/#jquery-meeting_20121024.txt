[09:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf kborchers jzaefferer mikesherov
[09:01:48] <gnarf> hey
[09:05:34] <jzaefferer> oh hi
[09:05:36] <kborchers> hey
[09:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> The dev summit went pretty well.
[09:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> We got a lot of tickets triaged and quite a few bug fixes.
[09:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov is now on a triage rampage :-)
[09:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> Nate Eagle started the dialog refactor.
[09:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have been working on that.
[09:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> We're planning to branch 1-9-stable today unless anyone has anything else that should happen before we branch.
[09:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> net splits during our meeting?!?
[09:09:23] <jzaefferer> ping tj_vantoll
[09:09:48] <tj_vantoll> Hey
[09:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll has been triaging tickets too :-)
[09:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> He's doing some triaging here and there in the past, but he's been much more active since the summit.
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> And he has ticket admin privs now, so he can actually triage instead of just leaving comments.
[09:11:05] <tj_vantoll> Yeah the rights are nice.
[09:12:08] <gnarf> :)
[09:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to figure out where old docs are moving: http://docs.jquery.com/mw/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&prefix=UI&namespace=0
[09:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through that list and filter it down to pages that haven't been moved already.
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can figure out where they belong (wiki, jqueryui.com, learn site, etc.)
[09:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> Also, we're thinking about moving away from pbwiki and using the GitHub wiki instead.
[09:15:01] <gnarf> +1 to that
[09:15:23] <gnarf> although pbworks seemed a little better about modification notices
[09:15:40] <gnarf> i don't think github does anything super visable when you modify a wiki
[09:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:15:45] <kborchers> +1 to github wiki
[09:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty important.
[09:16:01] <kborchers> ah, hmmm
[09:16:37] <gnarf> maybe we can feature request it?
[09:16:45] <gnarf> and it might show up before we switch?
[09:16:48] <gnarf> or
[09:16:55] <gnarf> lets do some actual testing of it
[09:17:04] <gnarf> make sure it doesn't send me an email I ignore or something
[09:17:05] <jzaefferer> well, its a git repo
[09:17:09] <mikesherov> hi
[09:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> So, we can build a tool around this.
[09:17:21] <gnarf> yeah, but afaik you can't set up a post-receive on the .wiki.git repo
[09:17:25] <mikesherov> sorry I'm late, never attended this meeting yet
[09:17:27] <gnarf> but we could write a tool
[09:17:47] <gnarf> Maybe the post receive api has more info
[09:18:30] <gnarf> yup
[09:18:31] <gnarf> http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/
[09:18:33] <gnarf> "gollum"
[09:18:38] <gnarf> gives you wiki updates
[09:18:54] <mikesherov> yeah, post receive API has almost everything
[09:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:19:26] <jzaefferer> can we create an issue for that? infrastructure?
[09:20:21] <gnarf> yeah
[09:20:42] <gnarf> I need to solve the deploy script -> IRC notifications anyway
[09:21:17] <mikesherov> also, make sure the deploy script -> trac ticket close actually links to the github changeset instead of just the SHA of the changeset
[09:21:19] <gnarf> also - I wonder if we can't get our IRC bot to start alerting about issues/pulls open/closed as well
[09:21:31] <mikesherov> gnarf: mergeatron
[09:21:51] <gnarf> mikesherov: will that let me aggregate depoly script results from 12 machines? :)
[09:22:31] <mikesherov> mergeatron can be extended to integrate IRC notifications when a pull request passes the initial mergeatron check
[09:22:48] <jzaefferer> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/117
[09:22:50] <mikesherov> at SNAP, we don't even review a PR until mergeatron says its good to look at
[09:23:13] <gnarf> mikesherov: this is about the deploy scripts for like the websites
[09:23:17] <gnarf> when we tag - it deploys
[09:23:23] <mikesherov> oh, nvm
[09:23:29] <gnarf> I want the output of any deploy to show up in IRC so we can look at it
[09:23:32] <mikesherov> sorry, I was thinking something else
[09:23:54] <mikesherov> I mean, I've done enough node-irc integration to get that done
[09:24:04] <gnarf> yeah - I am sure we could figure it out
[09:24:12] <gnarf> I was gonna see if clarkbox thought splunk might help here
[09:24:22] <gnarf> before hacking together a node one
[09:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> There's an atom feed for wiki pages, but it seems useless.
[09:24:33] <mikesherov> splunk notifier… interesting
[09:24:52] <mikesherov> I mean, splunkd is aggregating logs, right?
[09:24:54] <gnarf> yup
[09:25:00] <gnarf> and all the data i want is in the logs
[09:25:01] <mikesherov> Oh, simple enough
[09:25:11] <mikesherov> creating an alert based on logs is easy with splunk
[09:25:14] <gnarf> so theoretically - splunk could notify on any "exit" and link to the report
[09:25:23] <mikesherov> good call
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think that's it for the meeting.
[09:28:22] <gnarf> Dave_Stein:
[09:28:28] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: hey
[09:28:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: said he had something to bring up :)
[09:28:30] <Dave_Stein> what timing :)
[09:28:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any way to lay out what we're looking at for 1.10 and beyond if things are different than on the wiki?
[09:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: What do you mean? The roadmap should be accurate.
[09:29:18] <Dave_Stein> After months of falling off the earth, I finally bagged actual company time to work on UI.... has 2.0 been at a standstill since i disappeared?
[09:29:36] <jzaefferer> I may have suggested that we push things around depending on how much we get done beyond dialog
[09:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Nothing since the end of July.
[09:29:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that ^
[09:30:04] <jzaefferer> or that some new widgets have to wait for post-2.0
[09:30:16] <kborchers> and that ^
[09:30:17] <kborchers> :)
[09:30:21] <mikesherov> cool, how do I get something on the agenda?
[09:30:24] <Dave_Stein> So should I just pick up where I left off?
[09:30:38] <Dave_Stein> I think I had just started on sortable
[09:30:57] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: what's your google account email address?
[09:30:57] <Dave_Stein> I'm pretty sure I still have al lthe right as I still get all the lovely emails ;)
[09:31:04] <mikesherov> mike.sherov@gmail.com
[09:31:16] <mikesherov> I'm looking at this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArIM4UVbwE-3dFg1T0k4VlE1bF82Nm9tbW90cVNxN0E&pli=1#gid=39
[09:31:24] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: okay, you should have write access now
[09:31:29] <mikesherov> Cool
[09:31:31] <Dave_Stein> Starting next week I can probably spend at least 4-6  hours every wednesday
[09:31:36] <mikesherov> , just add something before the meeting?
[09:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I don't think you had started sortable. Just draggable and droppable.
[09:32:11] <mikesherov> I just wanted to discuss current pull request + triage policy (before I triage the remaining 316 tickets)
[09:32:12] <Dave_Stein> unlike when i was doing it i was spending ~3 hours every sunday if i had energy
[09:32:25] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah i never comitted sortable cause i was too ashamed of where i had gotten lol
[09:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:32:37] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: shoot!
[09:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure, let's discuss that :-)
[09:32:59] <mikesherov> OK, so, first off, when we ask for more info from OP's, we should always set to pending
[09:33:15] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: so i guess i should restart it on the interaction branch then? as long as there's no objection to me randomly coming back frmo the dead? :)
[09:33:15] <mikesherov> just saw a few cases where we weren't doing that, and was wondering if there was a reason
[09:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I honestly don't even remember what the state of the code is.
[09:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Go ahead :-)
[09:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> You'll probably want to have master merged in first.
[09:34:03] <mikesherov> yeah, master will be very different now :-)
[09:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We didn't have pending in the past.
[09:34:10] <mikesherov> so, everyone's cool on pending?
[09:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:34:15] <Dave_Stein> okay i'll do that.. i'm a *little* better with git than i was before
[09:34:26] <Dave_Stein> so i'll merge in and see what broke of what i had done already in draggable and droppable
[09:34:41] <mikesherov> great, if I catch people asking for more info and not sending to pending, I'll just manually do it.
[09:35:10] <Dave_Stein> fix that and continue on i suppose
[09:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Sounds good. You should probably send a PR just for the merge.
[09:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> Before working on new stuff.
[09:35:43] <mikesherov> cool, so second: I think pull requests should always have tests, not sure if that's a thing we ask for or not
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: usually
[09:36:26] <mikesherov> I mean even on things we're going to rewrite, especially at that point, good tests matter
[09:36:26] <tj_vantoll> How long do pending tickets stay open before they auto-close?
[09:36:32] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: 14 days
[09:36:36] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: okay i'll be sure to do that when i get started. heading off for now. i'll keep you posted on whatever progress i make
[09:36:39] <tj_vantoll> k
[09:36:40] <mikesherov> there is an avalanache coming :-)
[09:36:51] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that's what I was thinking :)
[09:37:02] <jzaefferer> ping petersendidit
[09:37:12] <gnarf> mikesherov: we don't ask those to write tests, because the example tests are terribad to base on
[09:37:21] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: hopefully you'll also see me in jquery room more again helping out. my schedule is very different over here now
[09:37:25] <Dave_Stein> see ya later
[09:37:28] <jzaefferer> gnarf: terribad?
[09:37:35] <mikesherov> gnarf: fair enough
[09:37:53] <gnarf> mikesherov: so there is like this thing to measure there - 1) ask for a test that will probably turn out to use a bunch of backwards practices started in the suite
[09:38:01] <gnarf> or 2) write a better test ourselves
[09:38:16] <gnarf> and sometimes we aren't even sure if its something that sticks around post-rewrite or whatever
[09:38:22] <mikesherov> as long as a test gets written, even if it's ourselves.
[09:38:32] <mikesherov> so fair enough
[09:38:33] <mikesherov> 3rd, I added a new report: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&keywords=~haspatch&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority&report=35
[09:38:48] <mikesherov> this checks open tickets for the keywords: "haspatch"
[09:38:48] <gnarf> jzaefferer: like do you really want someone to "add a test" to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/datepicker/datepicker_events.js ?
[09:38:58] <mikesherov> gnarf: I do
[09:39:17] <mikesherov> so the haspatch report is open tickets that have a fix in the attachments or github pull requests
[09:39:26] <mikesherov> is that useful? or a waste of time?
[09:39:37] <gnarf> mikesherov: if the current test files are sane i think it makes sense to ask for a test
[09:39:57] <mikesherov> gnarf: let me know which one's aren't sane, and I'll gladly rewrite them as my top priority
[09:40:10] <mikesherov> considering it's holding us back from asking for useful tests
[09:40:18] <gnarf> but if the test suite is a little off kilter in the first place, we should probably just handle writing a test ourselves because I don't think someone could look at the current suite and figure out how to add tests that are useful
[09:40:22] <mikesherov> it'll help the datepicker rewrites when the time comes
[09:40:43] <mikesherov> so I would gladly do that
[09:41:32] <mikesherov> is that something worth doing? It's cool if it isn't, but if it's a good thing, I'll gladly do it
[09:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Datepicker has a good test suite, but I doubt if any interactions have anything useful in the tests.
[09:42:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: are we talking like the nonsense globals in draggable?
[09:42:29] <mikesherov> like, I'm not trying to be pedantic, I'm trying to understand what's wrong with them, and if it's useful to unwrong them ahead of the rewrite
[09:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, draggable has 76 of 233 tests failing.
[09:43:40] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: if I can get them to pass, is that useful? Like I want to do the work that predates the actual rewrite
[09:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> Of the 157 passing tests, 60+ are the auto-generated common tests.
[09:43:47] <mikesherov> but we can talk about this in dev
[09:44:05] <mikesherov> OK, let's talk about that more in dev, as I'd like to help there
[09:44:26] <mikesherov> my goal is get all components to the point where people can contribute in a meaningful way
[09:44:48] <mikesherov> and right now, that's a blocker for the one's we've dictated rewrites on.
[09:44:53] <mikesherov> which is cool, I totally get it
[09:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:45:10] <mikesherov> anyway, lastly
[09:45:19] <mikesherov> 3rd, I added a new report: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&keywords=~haspatch&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority&report=35 is this a useful thing?
[09:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:45:38] <mikesherov> ok, cool
[09:45:44] <gnarf> seems so :)
[09:46:00] <mikesherov> One last thing actually.
[09:46:38] <mikesherov> I can triage the bugs…. but at some point, I need to triage the features. Once I get to that point (316 tickets from now), who do I turn to?
[09:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> You can come to me.
[09:47:10] <mikesherov> k, cool.
[09:47:14] <mikesherov> That's it for me
[09:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> When you get to that point, I'll go over our process for deciding features.
[09:47:28] <mikesherov> OK
[09:47:29] <mikesherov> great
[09:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[09:47:30] <jzaefferer> Generally keep it in #jqueryui-dev
[09:48:06] <mikesherov> If Dave_Stein is working on sortable, should I triage those first?
[09:48:12] <mikesherov> I think I will
[09:48:48] <mikesherov> OK, I'm done
[09:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Dave_Stein is working from scratch with essentially no API :-P
[09:49:17] <mikesherov> which is important though that I capture the bugs that existed with the old one behavior wise
[09:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> His task is basically: Start with nothing, let us know when you think an option needs to be added.
[09:49:25] <mikesherov> otherwise we should just dump all the tixx
[09:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, we should be looking at the old tickets (and we will). I'm just saying that it'll probably be a while before he even looks at those.
[09:50:26] <mikesherov> k
[09:50:29] <mikesherov> makes sense
[09:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> The point being that even if sortable is your lowest priority, you'll probably finish triaging before he looks at bugs.
[09:50:51] <mikesherov> right
[09:50:52] <petersendidit> jzaefferer: whats up
[09:51:27] <gnarf> dialog was the big focus for 1.10 right?
[09:51:49] <jzaefferer> petersendidit: Hey David. You know about our weekly meetings, right? Anything you have to share? What's the status of the classes option implementation?
[09:52:14] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yes, it is
[09:52:21] <petersendidit> yes do know about them, got pulled away with a work issue.
[09:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Correct.
[09:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer and I have been working on it this week.
[09:52:41] <petersendidit> https://github.com/petersendidit/jquery-ui/tree/classes_7053
[09:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> Hoping to merge that into master today.
[09:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> Which will close a ton of tickets.
[09:53:15] <jzaefferer> petersendidit: can you open a "just for code review" PR?
[09:53:20] <petersendidit> sure
[09:53:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer - who was it that was interested in trying to get clip working?
[09:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> Brendan Byrd?
[09:54:02] <petersendidit> Done; https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/790
[09:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/670
[09:54:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: think he wil stick around for it?
[09:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Maybe. Want to ping him about it?
[09:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> We can land them one at a time.
[09:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's not like we have to land all of them at once.
[09:55:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yup
[09:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think mikesherov and other Mike might've been interested too.
[09:56:59] <jzaefferer> Scott just walked away
[09:57:04] <jzaefferer> I think we can wrap this up
[09:57:08] <jzaefferer> Thanks everyone
