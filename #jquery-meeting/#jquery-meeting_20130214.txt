[08:12:46] <gnarf> it would be a testing meeting if there were people here
[08:13:17] <gnarf> just seeing if anyone is around/awake
[08:13:33] <gnarf> jzaefferer Krinkle JamesMGreene scott_gonzalez - do any of us have anything to discuss?
[08:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[08:16:42] <JamesMGreene> Seems like I had something minor but now I'm spacing
[08:17:36] <JamesMGreene> Anyone want to review my PR to help push it along? :)
[08:17:37] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408
[08:17:37] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Pull request #408 by JamesMGreene (1w 5d 17h 43m 23s): QUnit Composite - First round of major cleanup
[08:18:51] <JamesMGreene> It's primarily just a refactor to reduce surface area of the Composite addon's API
[08:20:04] <JamesMGreene> The git diff is pretty worthless, though
[08:20:10] <JamesMGreene> Lots of moved blocks
[08:21:54] <JamesMGreene> Oh, actually, to that point: jzaefferer was mentioning that we were likely going to slice the addons out of the main QUnit repo and give each its own repo
[08:22:42] <JamesMGreene> Anyone have more info on that, e.g. will the new repos remain in the jquery org or be taken on by their active maintainers?
[08:23:31] <JamesMGreene> I'll happily maintain the composite, junitlogger, and phantomjs addons
[08:24:25] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez gnarf jzaefferer
[08:24:29] <JamesMGreene> gibson042
[08:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what his plan was for that.
[08:25:39] <JamesMGreene> I think he said keep them in the jquery org
[08:26:04] <JamesMGreene> Not sure if it will matter either way, since their visibility was apparently nil before anyway :(
[08:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: BTW, you can make the diff more readable by turning off whitespace diffs.
[08:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408/files?w=1
[08:27:49] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #408 by JamesMGreene (1w 5d 17h 53m 35s): QUnit Composite - First round of major cleanup
[08:29:33] <JamesMGreene> Oh, nice, that's a bit better. Thanks for the tip, had no idea
[08:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub likes to hide their features so nobody can ever discover them :-(
[08:34:51] <JamesMGreene> Duly noted. Are there other things like that?
[08:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only one I know of for diffs.
[08:38:38] <gnarf> http://gnarf.net/2012/04/09/github-pro-tip-hide-red-lines-in-a-diff/
[08:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> They have a million keyboard shortcuts.
[08:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can just press ? to see a list of them.
[08:39:08] <JamesMGreene> right
[08:39:11] <JamesMGreene> That I knew
[08:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> If you're looking at a file and the URL has a branch name, you can press y to convert the URL to a SHA.
[08:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> Useful for when you want to share a link to a specific line in a mailing list.
[08:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> So tomorrow, when that branch has changed, the link still points to the correct line.
[08:42:47] <JamesMGreene> Right, I share like that but I wasn't aware of the keyboard shortcut
[08:43:29] <JamesMGreene> So, scott_gonzalez, want to review that PR with the whitespace diffing turned off and gnarf's bookmarklet to hide removed lines? =)
[08:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good, just had a few minor questions.
[08:56:22] <JamesMGreene> thanks
[08:56:37] <JamesMGreene> Should we close out this, umm, "meeting" now? :)
[10:02:56] <ajpiano> content meetinggggg
[10:03:08] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: agcolom kswedberg gnarf rworth
[10:03:17] <gnarf> ping ping
[10:03:28] <gnarf> now without mute
[10:03:31] <agcolom> Hello!
[10:03:32] * gnarf winks at ajpiano
[10:03:34] <ajpiano> oh right
[10:03:40] <ajpiano> power went to my head there i guess
[10:04:03] <kswedberg> hey
[10:04:28] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: so first things first, i'm gonna do a tag of jquery-wp-content and learn and push like, onw
[10:04:31] <ajpiano> now*
[10:05:07] <ajpiano> are you okay with that
[10:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:05:11] <ajpiano> or do you not want stipre
[10:05:12] <ajpiano> ok
[10:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> Stripe is good to go.
[10:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> And it won't be live anywhere until jquery.org ships.
[10:05:30] <ajpiano> yeah, it shouldn't interfere w/ anything certianly
[10:05:31] <ajpiano> exactly
[10:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Stripe is working though. It's fully implemented.
[10:05:55] <ajpiano> that's sweet
[10:06:45] <gnarf> afk a bit
[10:07:03] <ajpiano> great
[10:07:10] <ajpiano> so i'm gonna tag stuff and do my post
[10:07:19] <ajpiano> then this will be done forever™
[10:08:17] <ajpiano> code school should be ready next week, they went back to refilm some segments after the beta
[10:11:59] <ajpiano> based on last night's conversation after i left, it seems like removing the "subtitle" metadata was the right thing here, yes rworth scott_gonzalez ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/pull/30/files
[10:11:59] <b-ot> ajpiano: Pull request #30 by kleinmaetschke (12h 14m 15s): Updating markup conventions.
[10:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we're ripping out the custom page template.
[10:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> klein is working on that.
[10:13:38] <ajpiano> ok
[10:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> I assume he'll have an accompanying commit for jquery-wp-content.
[10:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which just deletes jquery.org/page.php
[10:13:59] <ajpiano> ok
[10:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> We talked about it earlier.
[10:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> Said he'd rather just rip it out and do it the right way than work with it for now and have to clean it up later.
[10:14:54] <ajpiano> yeah, there's really no point to doing things "wrong" at this point
[10:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:15:54] <ajpiano> do we have any standard as to when to do a patch vs minor release on jquery-wp-content ?
[10:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Usually minor for a sweeping change.
[10:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> I think I accidentally typed minor the other day.
[10:16:59] <ajpiano> i have half a mind to make this next tag be 2.2.0 because of the changes to the nav on mobile
[10:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[10:17:17] <gnarf> back
[10:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> The versions are almost meaningless at this point :-P
[10:17:30] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, indeed
[10:17:38] <ajpiano> so basically, at our discretion
[10:17:41] <scott_gonzalez> So it's basically at the whim of the tagger.
[10:19:16] <ajpiano> ok
[10:19:32] <ajpiano> so i guess we are shooting for .org at some point next week then?
[10:20:01] <ajpiano> still an awful lot of placeholder content in the pages
[10:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it.
[10:21:41] <ajpiano> ok
[10:21:49] <gnarf> ajpiano: is/will learn be official before the conf in vienna?
[10:21:59] <ajpiano> learn is gonna be official later today
[10:22:15] <ajpiano> and then i'm gonna just continue working on build process stuff as much as i can
[10:22:25] <ajpiano> unfrotuantely i'm off jq full time after this week :(
[10:22:54] <gnarf> get better at delegating to those of us still on the clock? :)
[10:23:06] <ajpiano> heh ok :)
[10:23:18] <gnarf> been awesome having you on this full time tho
[10:23:30] <gnarf> so much got done in the past weeks
[10:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[10:23:57] <gnarf> so, thanks for rockin it
[10:24:01] <ajpiano> :)
[10:24:21] <ajpiano> that said, wanna make the most of today and tom
[10:24:26] <ajpiano> so unlesss anyone has anything else for now?
[10:25:07] <ajpiano> i think we can take this back to -content
[10:25:33] <agcolom> did my 1st tag thx to scott_gonzalez  :-)
[10:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Speaking of which, feel free to tag as often as you want for the content repos.
[10:26:27] <agcolom> will do :-)
[10:27:21] <ajpiano> agcolom: yeah, i assume that 1.3 tag means 1.3 is close :)
[10:27:42] <ajpiano> agcolom: ping me and scott_gonzalez if you need help with .com or blog.*
[10:27:44] <agcolom> indeed! monday hopefully
[10:28:04] <agcolom> Ralph is working on those I think.
[10:28:16] <ajpiano> ok
[10:28:23] <agcolom> I have to work on my presentation in Vienna also now....
[10:28:48] <gnarf> back to work?
[10:29:17] <agcolom> ajpiano: I've totally stolen and re-adapted your slides btw (not the content but the content holder, if you see what I mean)
[10:29:37] <ajpiano> indeed gnarf back to work?
[10:29:45] <ajpiano> agcolom: awesome! show me in content! gonna close the room now
[11:02:59] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[11:03:03] <arschmitz> Hi
[11:03:04] <gseguin> Hey
[11:03:05] <JasonDScott___> Hi
[11:03:06] <uGoMobi> hi
[11:03:12] <toddmparker> hi all
[11:03:24] <toddmparker> The jQuery Mobile team meeting is starting up
[11:03:38] <toddmparker> Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0gosusDB_s3HN9rwaPUqqXNYvikjID87afLmdUtOIc/edit#
[11:05:00] <toddmparker> arschmitz: do you want to go first?
[11:05:11] <arschmitz> sure
[11:05:24] <arschmitz> finished the h2widget
[11:05:51] <toddmparker> (that is the jump to section panel used in the new demos)
[11:06:04] <arschmitz> working on demos to show how the h2widget and and the deeplinking works in docs
[11:06:06] <toddmparker> See: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/accordions/
[11:06:18] <toddmparker> think a lot of people will find that useful
[11:06:31] <toddmparker> the include is pretty painless
[11:06:53] <arschmitz> yup just a single data-attribute on the page
[11:07:01] <arschmitz> and everything is auto generated from there
[11:07:29] <toddmparker> might be good to release that as a plugin at some point personally
[11:07:42] <arschmitz> yeah would need to add some options
[11:07:52] <arschmitz> but its really pretty simple
[11:07:56] <toddmparker> right
[11:08:09] <toddmparker> makes it really easy to jump around
[11:08:19] <arschmitz> also fixed the links in the global nav panel we include
[11:08:47] <toddmparker> that's great.
[11:08:52] <arschmitz> wrote and extension to panel that on create will make all the links with in the panel absolute
[11:08:59] <toddmparker> so nav.html and the index page are all we need to update
[11:09:08] <arschmitz> yup
[11:09:21] <toddmparker> hurray
[11:09:26] <arschmitz> in nav.html you now make all your links relative to the demos folder
[11:09:32] <toddmparker> current docs are a nightmare, nav-wise
[11:09:38] <toddmparker> oh, uGoMobi - did you have a change to look at why scrolling is kinda bad with a panel open?
[11:09:39] <uGoMobi> the demos and widget folders have an index file as well
[11:09:57] <toddmparker> right. could we use the include on the widget index?
[11:10:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, not yet.. will test it after the meeting
[11:10:23] <toddmparker> ok, just curious. keep noticing it
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> hmmm toddmparker intresting idea ill look into that using a single include for all widget links
[11:10:50] <toddmparker> i did a sweep last night to make sure the h2 stuff is wired up to the widget pages, fixed some styling
[11:10:51] * agcolom is having a boiler problem at home so will be on/off (minor update this week all in the agenda)
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> they are both listview items so it should be easy
[11:11:07] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom
[11:11:12] <uGoMobi> yeah would be nice if you only have to add a new demo or widget page in one menu
[11:11:17] <toddmparker> right, my thought
[11:11:21] <johnbend1r> ...
[11:11:26] <johnbend1r> not sure at all
[11:11:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i can do that no problem.
[11:11:38] <johnbend1r> anyway
[11:11:41] <johnbend1r> I'm here
[11:11:50] <toddmparker> maybe the widget list view is an include so it would work in the panel or homepage or widget index
[11:11:56] <toddmparker> cool
[11:12:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:12:18] <toddmparker> that's ideal
[11:12:18] <johnbender> and now it's working
[11:12:19] <johnbender> ...
[11:12:20] <johnbender> wtf
[11:12:26] <toddmparker> you ok johnbender
[11:12:30] <toddmparker> :)
[11:12:31] <uGoMobi> just have to make sure it still works in the build for zip
[11:12:34] <toddmparker> right
[11:12:52] <arschmitz> yeah once i get it set ill get gseguin to make sure it all gets built right
[11:13:02] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:13:06] <toddmparker> cool
[11:13:14] <toddmparker> demos are in good shape
[11:13:27] <toddmparker> think with a few small fixes, they are in ok shape for 1.3
[11:13:31] <arschmitz> yup
[11:13:31] <gseguin> arschmitz: does it need more than what it's currently doing in grunt-0.4 ?
[11:13:42] <arschmitz> no it will just be 2 files instead of 1
[11:14:33] <gseguin> ok, we can take that offline, I'll merge master soon on grunt-0.4 and we can test
[11:14:46] <toddmparker> thanks gseguin
[11:14:50] <arschmitz> also working on updateing readme about the php include and htaccess
[11:15:03] <arschmitz> for demos
[11:15:17] <toddmparker> so for the switchover to the new demos…what needs to happen?
[11:15:45] <uGoMobi> server redirect
[11:16:07] <toddmparker> I'd like to archive the old docs on Monday, add the re-direct and have view.jquerymobile.com point to the new demos
[11:16:33] <toddmparker> ah, cool
[11:16:36] <toddmparker> view.jquerymobile.com works
[11:16:42] <arschmitz> and just one last thing for me is i wanted to thank everyone for how great everyone has been with support and encouragement since my son was born and has been in icu the amount of careing and support that has come from everyone here has been awesome. Way more then the people i see in person every day and my job i really really appreciate it
[11:16:58] <toddmparker> we don't' have the fancy index page like ui but it's a start
[11:17:21] <arschmitz> awesome view is up and working
[11:17:27] <gnarf> toddmparker: hrm
[11:17:28] <arschmitz> and index is simple enough
[11:17:36] <gnarf> actually http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/
[11:17:48] <gnarf> i think something might just be not deployed to live yet
[11:17:51] <arschmitz> gnarf: even better
[11:17:52] <toddmparker> arschmitz: of course. just glad everything is ok! congrats again!
[11:17:58] <gnarf> and yeah, i know it says jQuery UI still
[11:18:04] <toddmparker> heh
[11:18:10] <gnarf> even view.jquery.com says jquery ui right now
[11:18:11] <gnarf> :)
[11:18:17] <uGoMobi> ah great
[11:18:28] <uGoMobi> we have to clean up some branches
[11:18:34] <toddmparker> indeed
[11:18:55] <uGoMobi> but test will redirect to master branch
[11:19:02] <arschmitz> what do you mean slide panel only has 3 branches :)
[11:19:09] <uGoMobi> so people don't get to see this normally, right?
[11:19:16] <uGoMobi> lol arschmitz
[11:19:19] <toddmparker> it's public
[11:19:26] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[11:19:28] <toddmparker> think we can kill all panel branches now
[11:19:34] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:19:54] <arschmitz> now some are still good like grunt .4 and basetag
[11:20:12] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/branches (look at merged ones)
[11:20:24] <gnarf> prolly a few you can straight nuke there
[11:20:36] <gnarf> >1 month ago, merged branches
[11:20:50] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:20:56] <toddmparker> agreed
[11:21:07] <arschmitz> i think so too
[11:21:11] <uGoMobi> ok will delete panel branches now
[11:21:20] <toddmparker> gnarf: will we use using http://view.jquerymobile.com/test/ as our primary way of viewing master?
[11:21:54] <gnarf> toddmparker: http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/master/
[11:22:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: /test/ and /master/ are same thing it might make more sense to use master from now on
[11:22:06] <gnarf> the view.jquerymobile.com domain atm isn't up to date
[11:22:26] <arschmitz> then it matches the actual branches on github
[11:22:26] <gnarf> look on stage for now
[11:22:26] <toddmparker> right arschmitz - master is clearer
[11:22:48] <toddmparker> gnarf - right
[11:22:51] <gnarf> it should match branches and tags
[11:22:55] <gnarf> for top level folders
[11:23:17] <toddmparker> so: http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/master/
[11:23:20] <gseguin> oh yuck what happened to the styles?
[11:23:23] <toddmparker> seems a little busted
[11:23:33] <toddmparker> C grade, buddy.
[11:23:37] <gnarf> toddmparker: your stuff requires php yeah?
[11:23:39] <toddmparker> you've all been downgraded
[11:23:42] <gnarf> or a build step?
[11:23:50] <gseguin> yeah that's what I was going to say
[11:23:51] <arschmitz> one or the other
[11:23:57] <gnarf> you know which?
[11:24:04] <gseguin> PHP for now
[11:24:10] <arschmitz> either works right now test is a build but the ret are php
[11:24:22] <gseguin> build step later on once grunt-0.4 has landed
[11:24:32] <gnarf> so yeah
[11:24:40] <gnarf> no php included on that vhost yet
[11:24:54] <gnarf> jqueryui and jquery don't really suffer from problems when thats missing
[11:24:58] <arschmitz> some of the demos require php too
[11:24:59] <gnarf> so it never got turned on
[11:25:10] <toddmparker> gotcha. can you flip the switch on that?
[11:25:12] <gnarf> but yeah, need to turn on php
[11:25:21] <gseguin> thanks gnarf
[11:25:27] <gnarf> toddmparker: probably, if i don't get to it by like this weekend, poke me again please
[11:25:28] <toddmparker> thanks!
[11:25:31] <gnarf> super busy today
[11:25:35] <toddmparker> sure
[11:25:56] <toddmparker> we're hoping to switch over the the new server for monday's launch
[11:26:47] <toddmparker> guess that we'll still be publishing urls that are jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/ or whatever so this isn't an issue
[11:26:53] <toddmparker> this is all dev preview stuff
[11:27:14] <toddmparker> ^^ that URL above should be the new demos tho
[11:27:40] <arschmitz> yeah thats something that needs to be done for demos switch
[11:27:49] <gnarf> http://stage.jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/
[11:27:51] <toddmparker> should we go ahead and plan on switching to the new demos and getting the redirect in sooner? maybe tomorrow?
[11:28:01] <arschmitz> is old docs need to get nuked and demos need to move to root
[11:28:09] <toddmparker> right
[11:28:13] <arschmitz> and then all the links will need to be updated
[11:28:25] <toddmparker> which links?
[11:29:12] <arschmitz> right now everything is in /docs/demos/ will just need to make sure all new links account for them moving down
[11:29:20] <arschmitz> like index.html in the repo root
[11:29:30] <arschmitz> will need to go to demos now not docs
[11:29:36] <uGoMobi> right
[11:29:57] <arschmitz> not sure off the top of my head of others but good chance there are  some
[11:31:06] <toddmparker> gotcha
[11:31:16] <toddmparker> probably not too many
[11:31:24] <arschmitz> ok everyone i need to run to another meeting got double booked today should be a short one ill catch up when i get back
[11:31:29] <arschmitz> no should not be too many
[11:31:30] <uGoMobi> we can already copy ../docs/demos/ to ../demos/
[11:31:35] <toddmparker> i'd vote to do this sooner so there's no drama on monday
[11:31:36] <uGoMobi> so they live side by side
[11:31:44] <uGoMobi> and see if everything works
[11:31:48] <arschmitz> they will go bye bye from test if we do
[11:31:54] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good call
[11:31:54] <arschmitz> thats why we didnt do it before
[11:32:11] <toddmparker> can we cut test over to /demos/
[11:32:29] <arschmitz> ok sorry im really out now bye all
[11:32:35] <uGoMobi> I think that is in the index.php file?
[11:32:44] <uGoMobi> later arschmitz
[11:33:54] <toddmparker> by arschmitz
[11:34:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: looks like we have to update this page to make the switch https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/index.html
[11:34:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: L8R
[11:34:53] <toddmparker> be good if any links to /docs/ either goes to a landing page explaining the switch or just routes to the new demos
[11:35:51] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right
[11:36:00] <toddmparker> so let's move /demos/ up a level first
[11:36:07] * gnarf reiterates a point from last week - Start a list/issue for all the redirects you guys one, i can write em out and test on stage
[11:36:11] <toddmparker> then update the index page when we're ready to reveal
[11:36:14] <gnarf> s/one/want
[11:36:25] <toddmparker> thanks gnarf
[11:36:28] <toddmparker> will do
[11:36:43] <gnarf> also
[11:36:54] <gnarf> do you plan on running /demos/ out of view?
[11:37:02] <toddmparker> monday
[11:37:04] <gnarf> or is it gonna be loaded into the website via the repo like we do in ui
[11:37:17] <toddmparker> or sooner really. nobody is using the view url now
[11:37:58] <gnarf> our demos get imported from the jquery-ui repo when you deploy jqueryui.com
[11:38:24] <gnarf> so they are all on http://jqueryui.com/slider for instance
[11:38:24] <toddmparker> same here - right johnbender and gseguin
[11:38:42] <uGoMobi> the /docs/ index file is a redirect,to the index.html one level up, we can do the same for /demos/ but redirect to temp_index
[11:38:54] <gnarf> then you won't need view to do docs
[11:38:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: true
[11:38:56] <gseguin> toddmparker: right
[11:39:00] <uGoMobi> then we just have to rename the file and remove the old index
[11:39:17] <toddmparker> gnarf: our demos won't live on the site like that because the site template is kinda messy on mobile
[11:39:49] <toddmparker> gnarf: a url like this is part of the release process
[11:39:49] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/
[11:40:07] <toddmparker> those are the snapshot demos
[11:40:31] <gnarf> okay, so thats http://stage.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/demos/ ?
[11:40:49] <gnarf> or rather http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/
[11:40:56] <gnarf> once php is working
[11:40:57] <gnarf> ...
[11:40:58] <gnarf> ;)
[11:41:26] <toddmparker> think so if that is the tagged version of 1.2.0
[11:42:03] <gnarf> it should be
[11:42:09] <toddmparker> then yes
[11:42:55] <toddmparker> so there would be a url for each tagged release under view.
[11:43:17] <toddmparker> we're used this convention: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/
[11:43:36] <toddmparker> so we'd want to redirect from that old url convention to the new?
[11:43:47] <gnarf> yes
[11:43:57] <gnarf> there will be a few of those
[11:43:59] <gnarf> im sure
[11:45:58] <toddmparker> gnarf: created a wiki page for these - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Gnarf-redirects
[11:46:02] <toddmparker> :)
[11:46:49] <gnarf> toddmparker: is that pattern 100% accurate for each version you want, or am i just gonna implement it to find out it's wrong for version 1.0.0 ?
[11:46:52] <gnarf> :)
[11:47:22] <gnarf> 1->1 regexp replacement is fine... ;)
[11:47:30] <gnarf> and i can special case any of the ones we need to
[11:47:33] <toddmparker> i'll check
[11:48:02] <gnarf> thanks, thats the leg work i really need done to make it super easy to just plugin a list of redirects that i know are confirmed
[11:48:06] <toddmparker> so if you end up being busy, we should be able to deploy 1.3.0 the old way to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/ on monday
[11:48:24] <toddmparker> and we can get the redirects and view. working whenever
[11:48:31] <gnarf> monday prolly won't be too bad
[11:48:40] <gnarf> but flying to vienna shortly thereafter
[11:48:52] <toddmparker> me too. i'll buy you a beer
[11:48:55] <toddmparker> bier?
[11:49:21] <gnarf> :)
[11:49:34] <gnarf> on my german flight website
[11:49:49] <gnarf> Fluggesellschaft
[11:49:54] <gnarf> that word makes me cringe
[11:49:55] <toddmparker> nice
[11:50:10] <toddmparker> ok, urls were a bit wacko pre-1.0. adding to the wiki
[11:50:16] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Try this one: Donaudampfschiffahrtgeselschaft.
[11:50:19] <toddmparker> rather use consistent names on view.
[11:50:24] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: woah
[11:50:35] <uGoMobi> so the docs from 1.2 final release will be at view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/ and the 1.2-stable branch at view.jquerymobile.com/1.2-stable/   ?
[11:50:41] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: looks like the middle of that work says "fart"
[11:50:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It can be made much longer, too.
[11:51:01] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Yes. Its similar to the word "fare" as in cab fare.
[11:51:17] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Not the price, but the fact that the driver is transporting someone.
[11:51:24] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Like, "he's got a fare".
[11:51:47] <uGoMobi> welcome to German class
[11:52:06] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: In Swedish, the same word /is/ actually spelled "fart".
[11:52:07] * johnbender raises his hand
[11:52:09] <johnbender> can I go next
[11:52:45] * _|Nix|_ digresses.
[11:53:18] * johnbender goes 
[11:53:22] <johnbender> Nav stuff
[11:53:25] <johnbender> perf suite setup
[11:53:33] <johnbender> talking with some folks from intel about setting up a perf suite
[11:53:41] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good question
[11:53:52] <johnbender> oops
[11:53:53] <johnbender> :)
[11:53:58] <toddmparker> gnarf: what is the URL pattern for tagged releases vs. branches?
[11:54:13] <toddmparker> release = view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/
[11:54:31] <toddmparker> branch = view.jquerymobile.com/branches/1.2-stable/
[11:54:35] <toddmparker> ?
[11:54:40] <gnarf> http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/1.2-stable/
[11:54:52] <gnarf> doubt you'll ever have a tag/branch collision
[11:54:56] <toddmparker> man, those seem so darn close
[11:55:16] <toddmparker> probably not, more of a confusion concern
[11:55:30] <toddmparker> but if that's why ui and core do...
[11:55:53] <gnarf> there's not really a perceptible diff between a tag and a branch
[11:55:59] <gnarf> other than tag is like set once
[11:56:02] <gnarf> and branches keep moving
[11:56:16] <gnarf> there was an option in this view script to do a tags/ and branches/ folders
[11:56:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: they're effectively the same thing under the covers in git (iirc)
[11:56:48] <gnarf> they are all just pointers to SHA's
[11:57:16] <gnarf> except a branch has a "head" that follows along with work done on it, where the tags/ should never be changed once they are set
[11:57:39] <gnarf> not that you can't delete/push an update on a tag either
[11:57:44] <gnarf> you just shouldn't
[11:57:55] <gnarf> anyway, non-sequitur today
[11:57:57] <gnarf> bbiab
[11:58:38] <toddmparker> ok, makes sense
[11:59:02] <toddmparker> gnarf: I updated the wiki page https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Gnarf-redirects
[11:59:30] <toddmparker> 1.0 used a less ideal url scheme, fixed that at 1.1.0
[11:59:49] <toddmparker> ok uGoMobi you want to go?
[11:59:54] <uGoMobi> sure
[12:00:02] <uGoMobi> worked on demos
[12:00:12] <uGoMobi> will add a few more today/tomorrow
[12:00:27] <uGoMobi> ones that are listed here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4389
[12:00:27] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #4389 by uGoMobi (8mon 4w 13h 9m 40s): New docs: add demos
[12:00:39] <uGoMobi> disabling AJAX global in demos breaks view source
[12:00:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you give that a look?
[12:00:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[12:01:00] <_|Nix|_> Weird.
[12:01:07] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:01:07] <_|Nix|_> Like, $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false?
[12:01:12] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:01:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Does it break /all/ view source?
[12:01:31] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:01:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or just the AJAX ones?
[12:01:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird.
[12:02:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the demos where we SJAX in script/style are a bit different
[12:02:18] <uGoMobi> there you get to see the file tree
[12:02:33] <_|Nix|_> What?! Weird ...
[12:02:42] <toddmparker> yeah, be good to fix that up
[12:03:10] <toddmparker> or jus decide to leave ajax on?
[12:03:40] <toddmparker> thanks uGoMobi - anything else?
[12:03:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I'm definitely gonna check why turning off AJAX breaks things. It seems totally unrelated.
[12:03:47] <uGoMobi> added some things to 1.4 planning / roadmap
[12:03:49] <toddmparker> (realizing how late it already is!)
[12:03:53] <toddmparker> great
[12:04:01] <uGoMobi> that's it... next
[12:04:09] <toddmparker> who want to hop in?
[12:04:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender ^
[12:04:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You were already in the process ...
[12:04:37] <johnbender> yah
[12:04:40] <johnbender> Nav stuff
[12:04:42] <johnbender> perf suite setup
[12:04:47] <johnbender> which is basically done for now
[12:04:51] <johnbender> there are two examples
[12:04:56] <johnbender> and the kitchen sink is good place to start profiling
[12:05:01] <johnbender> and then the intel folks
[12:05:03] <johnbender> who contacted me
[12:05:29] <johnbender> are working on a full reqression suite between versions but I'm not sure how they're insuring they don't get version overlap
[12:05:32] <johnbender> waiting to hear back
[12:05:40] <johnbender> (noConflict, iframes, somethign else)
[12:05:48] <johnbender> if it's no conflict it won't work for us
[12:05:54] <toddmparker> good to hear you might have some help/collaboration there
[12:06:04] <johnbender> yah we'll see what we learn from them
[12:06:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they know you work on the project apparently
[12:06:19] <johnbender> anyway
[12:06:20] <johnbender> that's me
[12:06:25] <johnbender> if anyone wants to dive in on perf tests
[12:06:26] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender
[12:06:29] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ ?
[12:06:29] <johnbender> feel free
[12:06:31] <johnbender> just ask questions
[12:06:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I told one of them (siovene) about your perf work ...
[12:06:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's the guy who contacted me
[12:07:06] <toddmparker> thanks for making the connection _|Nix|_
[12:07:10] <johnbender> yar
[12:07:11] <johnbender> thanks
[12:07:35] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: want to go?
[12:07:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: NP. siovene is interested in contributing to core, and he started with that, and then I remembered seeing johnbender start a perf branch in our repo ...
[12:07:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[12:07:55] <_|Nix|_> So, I got the popup arrow to work on IE.
[12:08:00] <toddmparker> woot
[12:08:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, looks pretty good.
[12:08:20] <toddmparker> nice
[12:08:28] <toddmparker> did you update the demo?
[12:08:31] <_|Nix|_> Found a rendering bug in chrome which I reported ... maybe in half a year it'll be fixed ...
[12:08:38] <toddmparker> maaaybe
[12:08:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/popups/arrow.html
[12:09:01] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that's not it.
[12:09:10] <_|Nix|_> Sorry, it's a branch preview.
[12:09:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-arrow/docs/demos/demos/popups/arrow.html
[12:09:34] <uGoMobi> reminds me we have to rename the demos/demos/ folder
[12:09:44] <uGoMobi> showcase?
[12:09:53] <toddmparker> was just thinking that
[12:09:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It took them about half a year to fix the corners-poking-through-rounded-corners bug.
[12:10:09] <toddmparker> sure, showcase could work
[12:10:15] <toddmparker> examples?
[12:10:24] <toddmparker> dunno
[12:10:37] <uGoMobi> yeah examples is better
[12:10:38] <toddmparker> progress _|Nix|_
[12:10:45] <toddmparker> ok, examples it  is
[12:10:46] <uGoMobi> not all demos will be fancy
[12:10:50] <toddmparker> heh
[12:10:51] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:11:02] <toddmparker> you going to move/rename folders?
[12:11:04] <_|Nix|_> So, about grade c for IE ...
[12:11:08] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:11:12] <toddmparker> right - where did that land?
[12:11:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: cool
[12:11:37] <toddmparker> unfixable bug in IE& but only for multi-page, right?
[12:11:40] <_|Nix|_> IIRC we agreed to keep it grade A, but to document that multipage docs are to be avoided if support for IE7 is crucial.
[12:11:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[12:11:49] <_|Nix|_> AJAX works fine.
[12:12:08] <johnbender> toddmparker: that works for me
[12:12:17] <johnbender> especially given that it's not a regression
[12:12:21] <johnbender> maybe we should add it to the blog post?
[12:12:22] <toddmparker> right
[12:12:31] <toddmparker> we haven't heard a ton of noise on the issue to date
[12:12:36] <johnbender> I'm worried that people are assuming it works on ie :(
[12:12:49] <toddmparker> so let's just document in the api doc and maybe add a Q&A page
[12:13:03] <toddmparker> sure, we should add it to the blog
[12:13:03] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... it's been around since, probably forever, and only reported about a month ago.
[12:13:17] <toddmparker> mind replying to my blog BC message to remind me?
[12:13:25] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:13:30] <toddmparker> thanks!
[12:13:52] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: can you add the api docs note too?
[12:14:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I was gonna ask ... where in the API docs would I add that?
[12:14:18] <toddmparker> multi page works in IE7, but back button is wonky, right?
[12:14:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yep.
[12:14:57] <toddmparker> yeah, there isn't really a multi-page place in the API docs
[12:15:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If you use multipage, the back button is less than 100% effective in retreating in the history.
[12:15:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Perhaps where we introduce the concept of the page.
[12:15:35] <uGoMobi> the page widget isn't documented
[12:15:52] <johnbender> embedded pages are though
[12:15:57] <toddmparker> seems like it should be documented
[12:16:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Where?
[12:16:11] <johnbender> let me look
[12:16:20] <toddmparker> we could note it here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/navigate/
[12:16:36] <toddmparker> since it's hashchange/popstate/history related
[12:16:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, but be sure to link to that and/or https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5512 whenever you mention the caveat
[12:17:00] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5512 by erikyuzwa (3w 2d 2h 44m 40s): history stack seems to be screwy on IE7 and Firefox, Chrome
[12:17:07] <toddmparker> a simple Q&A would be good for this. "Why is the back button not working consistently in IE7"
[12:17:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[12:17:46] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess that page needs to be transferred to the API docs.
[12:17:49] <toddmparker> newer place :)
[12:17:50] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/pages
[12:18:29] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/pages/#Multi-pagetemplatestructure
[12:19:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, but that's not docs, that's demos, right? So, we need to create something on api.jquerymobile.com ... right?
[12:19:26] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yes, that's why i suggested the navigate API page for now?
[12:20:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm just thinking that maybe we should convert over http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html to the API docs.
[12:20:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Since that's pretty central to jQM.
[12:20:28] <toddmparker> we could
[12:20:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I (think I) can do it.
[12:20:32] <toddmparker> ok
[12:20:33] <uGoMobi> as part of page widget?
[12:20:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, or some section like "Concepts" or something like that. But the page widget will do.
[12:21:06] <gnarf>  /category/markup ?
[12:21:20] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[12:21:27] <toddmparker> why don't we have an API page for page.js?
[12:21:51] <uGoMobi> I don't know
[12:21:59] <uGoMobi> but we should add it
[12:22:26] <_|Nix|_> Definitely. Pages are super-essential to jQM, so it's kind of ironic that it's the one thing lacking docs :)
[12:22:29] <agcolom> hi, yes, we have header and footer but not page...
[12:22:31] <toddmparker> it has a few options that should be documented properly
[12:22:40] <agcolom> sorry about that !
[12:22:43] <toddmparker> (hi agcolom)
[12:22:48] <uGoMobi> right, header and footer is page.sections
[12:22:54] <gnarf> though prolly just a page/page.md would work
[12:22:57] <toddmparker> so let's add that and add the note there
[12:23:08] <toddmparker> and copy over a bunch of anatomy stuff there too if we want
[12:23:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No worries ... I can get started on that ...
[12:23:21] <toddmparker> or at least cover single vs. multi-page
[12:23:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[12:23:25] <toddmparker> cool
[12:23:40] <agcolom> yes please!
[12:23:47] <toddmparker> the sections (header/footer/content) can be light there, it's covered elsewhere
[12:23:51] <toddmparker> great!
[12:23:55] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[12:24:05] <_|Nix|_> OK, so one last thing ...
[12:24:11] <toddmparker> funny we all missed that one
[12:24:17] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[12:24:30] <uGoMobi> are data-dom-cache and data-prefetch options for page, or just something you can set on the page container?
[12:24:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I believe you can set them per-page.
[12:25:13] <uGoMobi> yes, just not sure if they are actually options in the page widget
[12:25:18] <toddmparker> per page
[12:25:43] <toddmparker> i see. markup vs. page widget?
[12:26:06] <_|Nix|_> domCache is an option. Prefetch is not.
[12:26:08] <uGoMobi> dom-cache is an option
[12:26:14] <uGoMobi> right
[12:26:35] <uGoMobi> prefetch has to go on a link
[12:26:43] <uGoMobi> my mistake
[12:26:44] <toddmparker> sorry to do this, but I have a meeting in 4 minutes
[12:26:52] <toddmparker> mind if we catch up in -dev?
[12:27:01] <toddmparker> feel free to keep chatting w/o me!
[12:27:12] <_|Nix|_> The Samsung folks mentioned to me that they'd benefit from a version of jQM that isn't wrapped for declaration as an AMD module, but that simply consists of a sequence of IIFEs (like the output from js/index.php) because that can be JIT-compiled a lot better.
[12:27:38] <_|Nix|_> They want to pre-compile jQM to improve webapp startup time.
[12:28:48] <_|Nix|_> ... but that may not be necessary if jQM would be a collection of independent IIFEs instead of wrapped in a top-level function, because it could be compiled JIT instead of all at once.
[12:29:27] <_|Nix|_> I suggested that they could use the output from js/index.php for that, because that one doesn't have the AMD module declaration wrapper.
[12:30:04] <_|Nix|_> ... but I promised I'd raise the issue, and I'm thinking that other environments might also gain a performance boost from such a setup.
[12:31:22] <_|Nix|_> This was my last item.
[12:31:56] <uGoMobi> anyone else has an update?
[12:33:09] <uGoMobi> ok looks like we are done
[12:33:32] <_|Nix|_> Alright - back in -dev then ...
[12:33:51] <uGoMobi> later
[12:34:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you shut down the room?
[12:35:01] <uGoMobi> ah I see he is away
[12:35:18] <uGoMobi> gnarf: are you still here?
