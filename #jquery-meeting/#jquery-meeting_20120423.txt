[08:54:53] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:00:33] <sindresorhus_> Hei
[09:00:40] <gibson042> hello
[09:00:41] <DaveMethvin> hiyo
[09:00:48] <timmywil> oi
[09:01:10] <DaveMethvin> geez i don't have meetings where everyone shows up on time, what is this?
[09:01:37] <rwaldron> here!
[09:01:59] <sindresorhus_> Late as always :p
[09:02:28] <DaveMethvin> ok, well let's get started then
[09:02:33] <rwaldron> sorry, i was pushing docs to Johnny Five
[09:02:38] <rwaldron> ;)
[09:03:08] <timmywil> he's alive
[09:03:15] <DaveMethvin> well damn
[09:03:18] <rwaldron> timmywil almost.
[09:03:31] <DaveMethvin> so you stayin, gibson042?
[09:03:49] <gibson042> network willing, yes ;)
[09:03:58] <timmywil> hi bot-t!
[09:03:59] <bot-t> timmywil, :)
[09:04:05] <DaveMethvin> since you've been so busy lately we wanted to ask if you wanted an official team-like position
[09:04:14] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 that is
[09:04:44] <DaveMethvin> you seem to be very friendly with that gzip guy, can you get me his autograph?
[09:04:48] <gibson042> yeah, I'd like that
[09:04:51] <gibson042> lol
[09:04:53] <DaveMethvin> cool
[09:05:04] <gibson042> what does it entail?
[09:05:20] <DaveMethvin> the initiation ritual is only minimally painful :P
[09:05:28] <DaveMethvin> you get your name on jquery.org/team
[09:05:28] <rwaldron> Some nails
[09:05:33] <rwaldron> tar... feathers...
[09:05:39] <rwaldron> blind folding
[09:05:42] <rwaldron> the usual.
[09:05:42] <DaveMethvin> poor rwaldron he couldn't sit for a week
[09:05:52] <DaveMethvin> but he got to be very good friends with the goat
[09:05:58] <gnarf> hey
[09:06:02] <timmywil> the goat hates him now tho
[09:06:04] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:06:12] <DaveMethvin> goat never got flowers
[09:06:20] <rwaldron> it got weird.
[09:06:21] <kswedberg> st33l333
[09:06:51] <timmywil> sooooo
[09:06:58] <timmywil> welcome!
[09:07:06] <gibson042> thanks! :D
[09:07:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[09:07:17] <DaveMethvin> and thanks for all your help on this
[09:07:24] <gibson042> it's been a blast
[09:07:45] <DaveMethvin> the changes you have made helped me understand things better so it's not just the smaller size either
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> ok so now that we have another sucke-er-team member
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> i keep looking at the bug pile and it's getting bigger
[09:08:57] <rwaldron> Looking now
[09:09:00] <DaveMethvin> we should whittle those down during our rewrites
[09:09:17] <DaveMethvin> lots of them are just small things, or perhaps even wontfix
[09:09:18] <gnarf> i was gonna take a fresh look at the effects bugs
[09:09:26] <kswedberg> woops. ^^ sorry about that random string up there. wrong window. :/
[09:09:28] <gnarf> hrm, no julian today?
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> so yeah might as well clear out the list since you're in there
[09:09:44] <DaveMethvin> haven't seen jaubourg
[09:10:17] <DaveMethvin> and now for another shot at a schedule :)
[09:10:30] <gnarf> i wanted to ask him if we had any good unit tests for .fn.promise
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> since the next conference is at the end of june, i think we need to have 1.8.0 out by then
[09:11:00] <DaveMethvin> working back from that we have about two months
[09:11:14] <timmywil> it would be a little cool if it was released during the conference imo
[09:11:30] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin blah
[09:11:38] <DaveMethvin> we could do that if it was solid
[09:11:42] <DaveMethvin> but you know  how that is
[09:11:44] <rwaldron> I thoguht we were going to slow the release pace
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> we think it's solid
[09:11:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: true, but if we really rc for a month...
[09:12:08] <DaveMethvin> 1.7 came out in november so it's been a while
[09:12:41] <DaveMethvin> so in the agenda i was making a  list of things that need to happen in those two months
[09:13:44] <DaveMethvin> i think we can get the bulk of the changes done by beginning of june?
[09:13:53] <timmywil> I am so skeptical of ccao
[09:14:06] <rwaldron> timmywil skeptical is kind.
[09:14:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i am too, but i want the ppl who like CCAO to come out of the woodwork to support it
[09:14:33] <DaveMethvin> if they don't i am not going to corner our team into supporting it unassisted
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> that's why it is staying in a branch
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> but there are some low-impact changes to sizzle
[09:15:18] <gnarf> *sigh*
[09:15:29] <DaveMethvin> so we could branch sizzle and have the jQuery CCAO pull that, or just merge it into Sizzle for everyone
[09:15:40] <gnarf> im not sure why but it just feels like if we are pushing 1.8 at the conf - we still might be going "too fast"
[09:16:03] <gnarf> granted, its an extremely convenient time to release
[09:16:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I can accept the ccao sizzle changes on master
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> let's see where things stand in a few weeks, it seems like we don't have anything that would prevent us from releasing?
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> thanks timmywil
[09:17:23] <gnarf> how are people feeling about effects btw
[09:17:46] <gibson042> I love the new hook points
[09:17:59] <DaveMethvin> me too, the code definitely got better
[09:18:09] <gnarf> there were still a few "issues" to look at with it
[09:18:16] <sindresorhus_> I love how it's more readable
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> So I really want to get going on messages about 1.8, esp the deprecation
[09:18:43] <DaveMethvin> i recall someone having concerns about the list I linked to there?
[09:18:49] <gnarf> http://jqbug.com/p731 -- anyone have an opinion on preFilter vs prefilter --- ajax uses ajaxPrefilter()
[09:18:55] <DaveMethvin> I'm going to start the draft of the deprecation list
[09:19:29] <DaveMethvin> also a blog entry on size, bloat, etc
[09:19:30] <timmywil> sizzle uses preFilter
[09:19:33] <timmywil> heh
[09:19:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i didn't have any concerns
[09:19:48] <gnarf> timmywil: hrm, so we do both
[09:19:51] <gnarf> great...
[09:20:00] <kswedberg> fwiw, I like prefilter.
[09:20:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, Sizzle is its own project, it can be a renegade.
[09:20:07] <timmywil> yes but sizzle's doesn't get used much publicly
[09:20:08] <DaveMethvin> i like prefilter too
[09:20:20] <gnarf> I'm indifferent
[09:20:20] <kswedberg> prefilter is a single word.
[09:20:27] <sindresorhus_> prefilter
[09:20:30] <timmywil> i like prefilter
[09:20:32] <DaveMethvin> sizzle is like a crazy uncle we keep in a closet
[09:20:41] <rwaldron> haha
[09:20:44] <gnarf> kswedberg's my authority here then, i'll fix it to "prefilter"
[09:20:47] <kswedberg> we don't do prePend. (BECAUSE PREPEND IS NOT A WORD)
[09:20:58] <kswedberg> ;)
[09:21:03] <DaveMethvin> when i was young we used preFilter and put an onion on our belts, because that was the style in those days
[09:21:03] <gibson042> well said
[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> Pend
[09:21:38] <DaveMethvin> Prep end
[09:21:45] <kswedberg> gotta bail. carry on… :)
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg!!!
[09:22:13] <jaubourg> hey Dave
[09:22:25] <DaveMethvin> gnarf was missing you
[09:22:29] <jaubourg> never sure when the meeting takes place now with time changes (summer time) and all
[09:22:41] * jaubourg hugs gnarf
[09:22:56] <DaveMethvin> so the new animation interfaces should be documented at some point
[09:22:59] <gnarf> jaubourg: hey! did we ever have any unit tests written for the .fn.promise() behavior in effects.js ?
[09:23:29] <jaubourg> yep, implicitely, there is this one big test where I used the promise to sync
[09:23:56] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I started some work on that in my pull description, and I think both gibson042 and mikesherov are up to speed in the code
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> good, i don't think it's too critical since it's hooky things but we should have it documented by the time it releases
[09:25:06] <DaveMethvin> were there any concerns about the new quickReady?
[09:25:06] <gnarf> jaubourg: which test?
[09:25:15] <gnarf> jaubourg: does it deal with "unqueued" promises too?
[09:25:21] <gnarf> jaubourg: cuz i feel like i lost some hook
[09:25:35] <gnarf> in the shuffle
[09:25:51] <gnarf> in particular this concept of mark/unmark
[09:25:59] <jaubourg> line 960
[09:26:03] <jaubourg> when is used
[09:26:16] <jaubourg> it deals with unqueued, yes
[09:26:21] <jaubourg> through mark/unmark
[09:26:50] <jaubourg> which is the less worst thing I could come up with
[09:27:44] <jaubourg> unqueued animation starts => mark (counter++) / unqueued animation stops => unmark (counter--)
[09:28:05] <jaubourg> if counter reaches 0 again, resolve for unqueued
[09:28:55] <gnarf> jaubourg: whats the "noUnmark" argument to opt.complete about?
[09:29:55] <gnarf> anyway - memory/perf testing ideas
[09:29:56] <gnarf> anyone?
[09:30:28] <gnarf> I want to make sure this isn't leaking like a sieve
[09:30:42] <DaveMethvin> would it make sense to run the current animation unit tests in some sort of loop to see if memory increases?
[09:32:31] <gnarf> maybe?
[09:32:40] <DaveMethvin> solid answer :)
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> would also be nice to get them to run right in unit tests, we still get some fails there
[09:33:26] <gnarf> you mean on browserstack?
[09:33:36] <DaveMethvin> when running in testswarm
[09:33:53] <DaveMethvin> due to the crazy out-of-focus timer issues
[09:33:59] <jaubourg> gnarf: iirc noUnmark is there for when animations weren't marked in the first place (no animation prop)
[09:35:24] <mikesherov> Still here?
[09:35:30] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:35:36] <gnarf> jaubourg: hrm
[09:35:39] <DaveMethvin> just talking about animations
[09:35:40] <gnarf> jaubourg: we need to change that
[09:35:42] <mikesherov> Sorry for my lateness
[09:35:44] <DaveMethvin> and how to test
[09:35:58] <mikesherov> Yes!
[09:36:08] <gnarf> jaubourg: my "finish" callback calls with true for "gotoEnd" stop calls
[09:36:13] <gnarf> jaubourg: but nothing else
[09:36:30] <mikesherov> In doing my refactorings, I noticed I could screw things up and the tests pass
[09:36:35] <gnarf> jaubourg: "finish( callback( stopped ) )
[09:36:47] <gnarf> mikesherov: can you help write some tests for those screw ups?
[09:36:58] <gnarf> mikesherov: i had to do that for that one of gibsons
[09:37:14] <mikesherov> gnarf: sure. I can tell you what the problems were too.
[09:37:20] <mikesherov> I'll collect that info
[09:37:22] <gnarf> mikesherov: thanks
[09:37:43] <DaveMethvin> so in terms of timing, do you want to land animations now, or should we wait?
[09:38:07] <mikesherov> I think we should land and manual test a lot.
[09:38:15] <gnarf> jaubourg: i don't see this "noUnmark" being utilized at all in 1.8-pre
[09:38:22] <mikesherov> But gnarf's call obv
[09:38:29] <gnarf> jaubourg: can't figure out where it would be calling complete( true )
[09:38:39] <jaubourg> line 129
[09:38:55] <jaubourg> exactly for the case I described
[09:39:02] <gnarf> hrm
[09:39:11] <gnarf> i was expecting a noUnmark = true
[09:39:13] <jaubourg> someone is grumpy :P
[09:39:30] <gnarf> yeah, not feelin good this morn
[09:39:42] <gnarf> anyway, thanks, I'll make sure I still do that
[09:39:51] <gnarf> the problem is now
[09:40:12] <gnarf> if you .stop() a unqueued it will pass false in i think
[09:40:25] <gnarf> I'll see if I can come up with a cleaner method
[09:40:33] <gnarf> now that the guts are more organized
[09:40:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: as far as landing goes, I leave it up to you, I don't mind maintaining the branch either
[09:41:04] <DaveMethvin> I'd prefer to land it
[09:41:12] <DaveMethvin> so i can do that after the meeting
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> if everyone is okay with it
[09:41:24] <mikesherov> +1 for landing
[09:41:28] <DaveMethvin> kind of gives us a better idea of where we stand
[09:41:36] <sindresorhus_> +1 landing
[09:41:56] <gnarf> easier to work from jquery/1.8pre I suppose
[09:42:00] <DaveMethvin> let me recheck the agenda ... anyone have other issues?
[09:42:07] <mikesherov> I do.
[09:42:18] <DaveMethvin> oh THAT'S why you showed up
[09:42:20] <mikesherov> Maybe it was discussed...
[09:42:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: let me pull mikes last commit and rename to .prefilter
[09:42:31] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[09:42:38] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: k
[09:42:38] <mikesherov> Having a "shared" object.
[09:42:50] <DaveMethvin> oh for our stuff now in sep closures
[09:42:55] <mikesherov> Yeah
[09:43:02] <rwaldron> +1 to landing new animation stuff
[09:43:06] <rwaldron> to get it out of the way
[09:43:21] <mikesherov> And having a prebuild pass to turn into locals.
[09:43:22] <DaveMethvin> what does everyone think about the shared obj?
[09:43:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: You plan to squash it I guess? I'll make a nice single commit for ya if you want
[09:43:32] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i can squash it
[09:43:37] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: coo
[09:44:26] <DaveMethvin> so there was some discussion on that thread about whether we should just bite the bullet and use the build step before any testing
[09:44:35] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm +1 to shared object of proprties, but I hate the idea of it being transformed via a build process
[09:45:01] <jaubourg> I think I missed this whole shared object businee
[09:45:02] <jaubourg> ss
[09:45:07] <mikesherov> +1 on build before test
[09:45:17] <rwaldron> I'd prefer to take the source IIFEs out
[09:45:31] <rwaldron> and return to an age of testing the built code
[09:45:33] <jaubourg> +1 rwaldron
[09:45:38] <mikesherov> +1
[09:45:39] <rwaldron> grunt watch will auto build as you develop
[09:45:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:45:42] <gibson042> +1
[09:45:45] <sindresorhus_> +1
[09:46:00] <jaubourg> we could put common vars in a module
[09:46:00] <DaveMethvin> well looks like we have agreement
[09:46:06] <jaubourg> ooooh, that's what we were talking about
[09:46:38] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron you want to do the honors?
[09:46:50] <rwaldron> Yes, I'd love that
[09:46:58] <gibson042> I'm -1 on leaving a module in dist
[09:47:15] <gibson042> as an object
[09:47:31] <mikesherov> I agree with gibson042. Byte waster.
[09:47:35] <DaveMethvin> yep, and slower
[09:47:46] <jaubourg> yep
[09:47:50] <DaveMethvin> CCAO impacts too :P
[09:47:55] <jaubourg> pfffff
[09:48:02] <rwaldron> well, we may not even need an object
[09:48:20] <rwaldron> especially since we're in consensus on removing the module IIFEs
[09:48:26] <rwaldron> and always testing built code
[09:48:29] <jaubourg> is there anyone active in the core team right now that believes in CCAO for jQuery development?
[09:48:33] <rwaldron> we can just use regular vars
[09:48:49] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: soon you will say there is no Easter Bunny
[09:48:50] <rwaldron> jaubourg -1
[09:49:01] <DaveMethvin> LALALA NOT LISTENING
[09:49:05] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: WHAT?!?
[09:49:09] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:49:12] <mikesherov> +1 on regular vars
[09:49:14] <jaubourg> god, you just crushed me
[09:49:31] <mikesherov> I just like a way of knowing the var isn't in this file
[09:49:41] <gibson042> +1 mikesherov
[09:49:49] <rwaldron> I love tickets that start with...
[09:49:51] <rwaldron> "I have a fixed-width div inside a td element. I'm trying to toggle the width of the div using .toggle(1000) and .animate({width: 'toggle'}, 1000)"
[09:49:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, so how would we do that?
[09:49:56] <mikesherov> If "shared_var" is our convention though, that's fine
[09:50:07] <DaveMethvin> ok, that works for me
[09:50:30] <rwaldron> mikesherov, a simple comment?
[09:50:41] <DaveMethvin> not_in_my_iife somevar;
[09:50:55] <mikesherov> Sure. And convention: shared_realvarname
[09:50:58] <rwaldron> / `foo` is initialized (and assigned [if this is the case]) in core.js
[09:51:02] <rwaldron>  // `foo` is initialized (and assigned [if this is the case]) in core.js
[09:51:07] <rwaldron> stupid irc commands
[09:51:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: pushed https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/7465bf19e95753b23796e28375a1af93b228dac5
[09:51:16] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by gnarf37 (1m, 33s ago): Effects: 1.8 Animation Rewrite - thanks @mikesherov and @gibson042
[09:51:22] <rwaldron> nice
[09:51:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: figured I'd give you a draft commit message too
[09:51:46] <DaveMethvin> you make life easy gnarf
[09:51:48] <rwaldron> ?hi5 @gnarf @gibson042
[09:51:50] <bot-t> rwaldron, Couldn't find "hi5 @gnarf" in jQuery Docs.
[09:51:53] <DaveMethvin> i don't even have to put my mint julep down
[09:51:58] <rwaldron> ?hi5 gnarf gibson042
[09:51:59] <bot-t> rwaldron, Couldn't find "hi5 gnarf gibson042" in jQuery Docs.
[09:52:03] <rwaldron> dumb.
[09:52:11] <gnarf> ?js hi5("gnarf", "rwaldron", "gibson")
[09:52:13] <bot-t> gnarf: "gnarf _o/\o_ rwaldron _o/\o_ gibson"
[09:52:17] <rwaldron> ooooooo
[09:52:18] <rwaldron> yay!
[09:52:24] <gibson042> :)
[09:52:38] <rwaldron> without bot-t.com, I have no idea what I'm doing
[09:53:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also merged to current 1.8pre so it should land without effort
[09:53:40] <mikesherov> So. We need to JSHint entire source and always build before test
[09:53:49] <DaveMethvin> Y E S
[09:53:58] <DaveMethvin> i have forgotten to build several times
[09:54:02] <DaveMethvin> before commits
[09:54:10] * jaubourg spanks
[09:54:27] <DaveMethvin> then we need a real-time commit of the byte size, kind of like an EKG (complete with beeps) :)
[09:54:49] <DaveMethvin> if it reaches 34KB, it flat-lines
[09:54:55] <gnarf> lol
[09:55:02] <jaubourg> sooo, when do we take out ajax and effects and make them official plugins and REALLY gain size
[09:55:03] <jaubourg> ?
[09:55:13] <rwaldron> mikesherov that's easy with "grunt watch"
[09:55:13] <DaveMethvin> .attr() goes first
[09:55:18] <rwaldron> just run it
[09:55:19] <jaubourg> deal
[09:55:22] <rwaldron> get in the habit
[09:55:33] <rwaldron> we need to say "As a core development team, we agree to do smart things"
[09:55:41] <jaubourg> rwaldron: compare-size doesn't seem to work on windows
[09:55:44] <jaubourg> no idea why
[09:55:45] <DaveMethvin> who let that rwaldron guy in?
[09:55:50] <rwaldron> jaubourg hrm.
[09:55:51] <mikesherov> Sure, rwaldron. I'm just saying, we're commiting to only having tests work on built. Making it clear.
[09:56:02] <rwaldron> mikesherov right
[09:56:02] <jaubourg> but it's nice I can ad lotsa byted without being bothered :P
[09:56:05] <rwaldron> but like...
[09:56:13] <rwaldron> I think that's ok
[09:56:18] <DaveMethvin> oh we know jaubourg, we KNOW :D
[09:56:20] <rwaldron> considering jQuery ships built
[09:56:26] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:56:38] <jaubourg> yeah, that and test minified too
[09:56:48] <jaubourg> since we do ship a minified version
