[08:59:33] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:01:26] <timmywil> boosh
[09:01:31] <DaveMethvin> zowie!
[09:01:41] <DaveMethvin> i have not yet washed away
[09:02:04] <DaveMethvin> who cares what happens with jquery, the world is ending on the east coast!
[09:02:14] <gnarf> :/
[09:02:30] <gnarf> Chicago is having like 20ft swells on lake michigan
[09:02:38] <gnarf> forecasted at least
[09:02:40] <DaveMethvin> things look bad for nyc
[09:02:57] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov i assume you are at home?
[09:03:04] <mikesherov> yes
[09:03:39] <DaveMethvin> i guess i could have said "mikesherov i assume you are sane?"
[09:03:59] <mikesherov> HAHAH
[09:04:16] <DaveMethvin> okay, well we can get a lot done since we're trapped inside our homes
[09:04:32] <DaveMethvin> as the black eyed peas said, let's get it started
[09:04:47] <timmywil> chattanooga's fine, just colder
[09:04:56] <timmywil> losers
[09:05:02] <DaveMethvin> not exactly bike weather tho
[09:05:11] <DaveMethvin> so last week i was thinking we'd get a 1.8.3 out but there wasn't that much in the release
[09:05:15] <DaveMethvin> so i punted
[09:05:17] <timmywil> I did ride the bike
[09:05:28] <timmywil> MOTORCYCLES
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> plus it brought up the issue we discussed int he email thread
[09:05:48] <DaveMethvin> about forking
[09:05:53] <DaveMethvin> or branching
[09:06:02] <DaveMethvin> i think we established that master will become 2.0
[09:06:07] <DaveMethvin> and 1.9 will be in a branch
[09:06:18] <DaveMethvin> so let's get 1.9 as buttoned up as we can before branching
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> to save ourselves some hassle
[09:06:37] <timmywil> we should have both in branches to start with imo
[09:07:12] <DaveMethvin> we can land the 1.9 stuff as pull requests, which (if we have botio working) can be tested before merge
[09:07:20] <DaveMethvin> gnarf is botio  just daid?
[09:07:35] <DaveMethvin> wasn't even responding to my /botio calls a coupla days ago
[09:07:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, something broke, and rather than spend time fixing it, I want to just get mergeatron workin
[09:07:57] <DaveMethvin> sounds fine to me
[09:08:04] <DaveMethvin> forward!
[09:08:36] <DaveMethvin> any thought on an eta for that gnarf?
[09:09:31] <DaveMethvin> Are there any things not in 1.9 tickets that anyone thinks need to be done?
[09:09:44] <DaveMethvin> timmywil anything in sizzle?
[09:09:53] <gnarf> I plan on working with it this week, assuming mikesherov thinks it's time for us to start setting up and doesn't want to do any other prep-work for it
[09:10:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's not in tickets, but it's in Sizzle issues
[09:10:13] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:10:28] <DaveMethvin> i
[09:10:28] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I was thinking we should bite the bullet and deprecate $( html, props )
[09:10:42] <mikesherov> right
[09:10:57] <timmywil> I think scott_gonzalez would object to that
[09:10:57] <mikesherov> so, I was finishing up the mergeatron changes to sqlite
[09:11:00] <DaveMethvin> gibson042:  would be fine with me, i think scott_gonzalez and jaubourg had strong feelings about it
[09:11:07] <gnarf> people use it
[09:11:20] <timmywil> gnarf: true nuff
[09:11:21] <DaveMethvin> the part about that sig that causes pain is the part where any unknown methods are treated like attributes
[09:11:25] <gnarf> and we were all like "look at this cool signature"
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg convinced me it could be useful, and he agreed the problem is the auto-attributification
[09:11:53] <gnarf> I have no love for the signature myself
[09:11:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i worded it
[09:12:16] <DaveMethvin> so I'd say let's warn the crap out of it in the docs
[09:12:20] <gibson042> I mean, the "benefits" can be provided with a one-liner $.fn.do = function( obj ) { for ( var method in obj ) { this[ method ]( obj[ method ] ); } return this; }
[09:12:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, if we hadn't already released that cat
[09:13:05] <timmywil> it was one better than attrFn imo
[09:13:12] <gibson042> that's why it's deprecate instead of remove
[09:13:26] <DaveMethvin> it bothers me also that it's so special, like it can't handle two elements
[09:13:36] <DaveMethvin> only one special element
[09:13:37] <gibson042> or an element with an inline attribute
[09:13:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:14:04] <gibson042> or a preexisting element
[09:14:08] <gibson042> the list goes on
[09:14:13] <timmywil> disconnected only
[09:14:15] <gnarf> gibson042: .do seems interesting
[09:14:25] <DaveMethvin> exactly, it would be better as a general method like you did it
[09:14:28] <mikesherov> the problem is simple for attrFn actually
[09:14:43] <mikesherov> collisions between jquery method names and attributes
[09:14:45] <mikesherov> right?
[09:14:55] <mikesherov> or am I missing something?
[09:15:16] <gibson042> yeah; what are everyone's thoughts on an official repository of jQuery one-liners? it would be perfect for stuff like that (core candidates, edge cases, etc.)
[09:15:42] <timmywil> start with plugins
[09:15:44] <petro> what exactly do you mean by "one-liners"?
[09:15:51] <DaveMethvin> simple "plugins"
[09:15:57] <gnarf> out of curiosity, has everyone watched johnbender's talk on category theory and jQuery?
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: i think it would be good
[09:16:12] <gibson042> stuff that we don't want in core but do want to be done the same way everywhere
[09:16:14] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i did
[09:16:18] <gibson042> a collection of microplugins
[09:16:36] <mikesherov> I'm against it actually
[09:16:49] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't have to be an official thing
[09:16:58] <mikesherov> Only because it's increased API surface area
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we want to be responsible for documenting/supporting it
[09:17:05] <mikesherov> oh, unofficial, no problem
[09:17:19] <DaveMethvin> but the idea is that when people say "this isnt' there" we point them to the one liner
[09:17:24] <mikesherov> I wouldn't want it in github.com/jquery/
[09:17:25] <gibson042> bingo
[09:17:33] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: agreed there
[09:17:53] <petro> gibson042: sorta like backbone-like utils for jquery?
[09:18:01] <gnarf> we gave up on "official plugins" a while back didn't we? :)
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: we just haven't had the opportunity to have too many
[09:18:17] <DaveMethvin> that fit the bill
[09:18:36] <gnarf> well like the deprecated / back-compat plugins I think should be the only 'official' ones
[09:18:47] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:18:59] <gibson042> petro: something like that
[09:19:03] <DaveMethvin> but if one of the team wanted to create some that woudl be good
[09:19:06] <gibson042> gnarf what about Color?
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> i was playing around with Array operations for jQuery sets ... $(sel).unshift(x) and such
[09:19:43] <DaveMethvin> same semantics as the Array methods
[09:19:51] <gnarf> gibson042: Color has been in the jquery/ repo for a while - and aside from it's size...
[09:20:05] <DaveMethvin> similar semantics to what we were trying to do with .before() and .after() on disconnected elems
[09:20:10] <gibson042> yeah DaveMethvin, those plus .do are what got me thinking along these lines
[09:20:39] <DaveMethvin> i think we should just do these as individual projects and point to them liberally when people complain
[09:20:55] <DaveMethvin> like, if someone says "but i was using .before() on disconnected lements!"
[09:21:00] <gibson042> :+1:
[09:21:10] <mikesherov> well, tell those people to shut up
[09:21:14] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:21:15] <mikesherov> :-P
[09:21:48] <DaveMethvin> okay, well i like the idea but it's not an official team thing
[09:21:55] <mikesherov> cool
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> i would say let's leave $(html, props) alone for now
[09:22:49] <gibson042> so, don't deprecate?
[09:22:56] <DaveMethvin> not for 1.9 i think
[09:23:02] <mikesherov> +1
[09:23:04] <DaveMethvin> we should tell ppl not to use bare attributes
[09:23:10] <mikesherov> just remove .fn.size
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> since there can be name conflicts
[09:23:15] <DaveMethvin> oh god
[09:23:36] <DaveMethvin> deprecating $(html,props) would be much easier than removing .size()
[09:24:02] <mikesherov> really?
[09:24:06] <DaveMethvin> and ppl can say attr: {size: 123} without any ambiguity
[09:24:16] <DaveMethvin> lots of crazy ppl and PLUGINS use .size9)
[09:24:21] <mikesherov> I see
[09:24:21] <petro> IE barfs with $(html, props) if you try to set a class attribute (on images at least)
[09:24:31] <mikesherov> petro speaks the truth
[09:24:32] <DaveMethvin> that's a keyword issue petro
[09:24:42] <DaveMethvin> oh no that's the className thing
[09:24:46] <petro> no, even if it's quoted
[09:24:47] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> and that's yet another reason
[09:25:16] <DaveMethvin> and if we remove the hook it will suck even more
[09:25:30] <DaveMethvin> which if we ever get to the 1.9 discuss....
[09:25:34] <DaveMethvin> so let's move along
[09:25:48] <DaveMethvin> acutally let's move to 1.9 voting
[09:26:05] <mikesherov> this one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12002#comment:17
[09:27:12] <DaveMethvin> i can't even remember what was going on with that one ... just that it was the one that confused me b/c we have two html single-element parsers
[09:27:18] <mikesherov> right
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> .clean() and .ini()
[09:27:25] <mikesherov> let's move on as you said
[09:27:56] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg isn't here but 11850 seems like a magic thing to me
[09:28:12] <DaveMethvin> if you return a 403 error it seems really strange for jQuery to run script
[09:28:33] <DaveMethvin> this is how ajax got so screwed up, trying to do too much magic
[09:28:42] <mikesherov> I agree
[09:28:55] <DaveMethvin> i'm the only vote, so i guess that's enough
[09:29:03] <mikesherov> I just downvoted too
[09:29:59] <DaveMethvin> 12763,out
[09:30:29] <mikesherov> Wait, so we're closing tixx right now
[09:30:31] <mikesherov> awesome
[09:30:41] <DaveMethvin> might as well
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> if you want to discuss just speak up
[09:31:07] <mikesherov> oh right, we committed to that
[09:31:16] <mikesherov> you copy pasted the agenda, I got confused
[09:31:20] <gnarf> i added a -1 to 11850
[09:31:39] <DaveMethvin> 3827, I'll reopen and assign to me, but it might be re-closed if it's too hard
[09:31:52] <mikesherov> cool
[09:32:07] <gnarf> so if we close up 12763 what about 12380
[09:32:26] <mikesherov> close
[09:32:40] <DaveMethvin> someone do that
[09:32:48] <gnarf> got it
[09:32:55] <mikesherov> did it already
[09:33:00] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10485 we should close
[09:33:02] <DaveMethvin> 11795, gibson042 wanted to tackle and i'd love to see it done
[09:33:06] <gnarf> NVM, mike beat me
[09:33:10] <mikesherov> won't be relevant until IE9 dies
[09:33:27] <mikesherov> someone close that, not me
[09:33:31] <mikesherov> 10485

[09:33:42] <gnarf> PS ^^^
[09:33:45] <gnarf> might be useful ;)
[09:33:50] <gnarf> afk quick
[09:34:16] <mikesherov> ?11115 let's discuss
[09:34:24] <bot-t> mikesherov, 12/29/2011 - Timeline ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline?from=2011-12-29&daysback=30&authors=

[09:35:02] <mikesherov> ".IS()" AND ".FILTER()" DISAGREE ON ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR "[CHECKED]"
[09:35:12] <mikesherov> we said we'd fix this by removing boolHook?
[09:35:22] <DaveMethvin> that's what timmywil said
[09:35:28] <mikesherov> Is there anything else we can do to fix this without removing boolHook?
[09:35:52] <timmywil> not without making things more inconsistent
[09:36:03] <mikesherov> so, is it time to remove boolHook?
[09:36:09] <DaveMethvin> gulp
[09:36:14] <timmywil> I would love to
[09:36:17] <mikesherov> this was the big backlash
[09:36:18] <timmywil> dunno if we can
[09:36:20] <DaveMethvin> but now would be the time
[09:36:38] <DaveMethvin> we've spent 2 years now explaing the diff between attr and prop
[09:36:50] <DaveMethvin> but yeah there's still lots of old code
[09:36:57] <mikesherov> at this point, it's .attr('selected', true) ?
[09:37:17] <mikesherov> or .attr('selected', 'selected') ?
[09:37:21] <timmywil> setting dynamic boolean values with attr instead of prop, yea
[09:37:34] <timmywil> problem we told people to use attr up until 1.6
[09:37:36] <DaveMethvin> people still don't get it
[09:37:38] <timmywil> is*
[09:37:52] <mikesherov> so is it time?
[09:38:06] <timmywil> vote
[09:38:12] <DaveMethvin> how about this
[09:38:26] <mikesherov> my vote will be determined by whether or not jQuery UI still has incorrect uses in it
[09:38:27] <DaveMethvin> we remove it and try an alpha to see how badly it breaks shit
[09:38:30] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:38:37] <mikesherov> if so, the world at large has no shot
[09:38:40] <timmywil> O.o
[09:38:44] <timmywil> i love doing that
[09:38:48] <gnarf> Hrm
[09:38:56] <timmywil> heh
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> we can always put it back
[09:38:58] <gnarf> personal thought - remember 1.4 anyone?
[09:39:08] <mikesherov> I don't
[09:39:10] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: what was the issue there?
[09:39:11] <gnarf> [attr=not quoted] ?
[09:39:25] <gnarf> there was actually a warning that jQuery threw for those
[09:39:30] <mikesherov> OH
[09:39:32] <gnarf> that or it was QSA
[09:39:35] <mikesherov> jQuery.error?
[09:39:43] <gnarf> but basically
[09:39:44] <timmywil> qsa does and we do too now
[09:39:45] <DaveMethvin> i am personally dedicated to having a really good  upgrade guide
[09:39:46] <mikesherov> We can always jQuery.error on it
[09:39:55] <DaveMethvin> so ppl should be able to see what will break
[09:40:04] <gnarf> I think it would be REALLY useful to start adding "yo-this is deprecated, don't use it fool" messages
[09:40:04] <DaveMethvin> and the jquery-compat plugin can do some of that too
[09:40:06] <gnarf> in "dev" mode
[09:40:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: exactly
[09:40:19] <DaveMethvin> the uncompressed compat plugin can whine
[09:40:22] <ryanneufeld> +1 to that
[09:40:24] <mikesherov> but also, we can provide a regex they can use to change .attr('selected' to .prop('selected'
[09:40:42] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: agreed
[09:40:43] <gnarf> mikesherov: cuz regexp solves everything! see ?zalgo
[09:40:43] <bot-t> mikesherov, HÕßÃáÃèÃäÃæÃπÃôÃ¶ÃÆÕâÃ©ÃóÃóEÕ®ÕÜÕíÃÜÕÆÃÉÕèÃ∑ÃÆÃ£Ã´Ã§Ã£ ÃÄÃâÕÉÕ¨ÕëÕ°ÃµÃûÃπÃªÕÖCÕØÃÇÕêÕèÃõÃ®ÕîÃ¶ÃüÕàÃªOÃΩÕÆÕêÕóÃÄÕ§ÃçÕÄÕ¢ÃúÕéÕçÕôÕöÃ¨ÃùÃ£MÃâÃíÃ¥Ã°Õ†Ã≤Ã≠ÕçÕáÃºÃüÃØÃ¶EÕ•Õ§Õ©ÃæÕëÃîÕêÃõÕÖÃ∞ÃôÃûÃ™ÃóTÃøÃøÃìÃΩÕêÃ¥Ã∑Ã∑Ã±ÃóÃºÕçHÃîÃÑÕúÃôÃô
[09:40:48] <DaveMethvin> well for each bitch there can be a guide about what to do
[09:41:02] <timmywil> that's hard to read
[09:41:03] <DaveMethvin> okay so let's go for it
[09:41:09] <mikesherov> +1
[09:41:10] <DaveMethvin> remove the hook
[09:41:22] <DaveMethvin> and if too much stuff breaks we can always put it back before release
[09:41:22] <gnarf> add it to compat with a warn
[09:41:26] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:41:31] <timmywil> dun dun duuuhn
[09:41:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:41:37] <gnarf> as long as its still in "compat" i'm cool with it
[09:41:45] <mikesherov> great
[09:41:50] <timmywil> ok, I gotta run, bbs
[09:42:01] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks!
[09:42:14] <DaveMethvin> continuing the list
[09:42:42] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: i'd love if you tackled the script inconsistencies
[09:42:51] <mikesherov> Yes
[09:42:53] <mikesherov> needs to be done
[09:42:53] <DaveMethvin> it's worth a try

[09:45:32] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:45:34] <gnarf> if it is, we should at least doc it
[09:45:45] <mikesherov> k
[09:46:02] <mikesherov> 9832 is fine
[09:46:04] <mikesherov> let's do it
[09:46:12] <gnarf> 9832: +1 added
[09:46:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah nobody better complain we didn't fix what we could

[09:47:19] <DaveMethvin> the problem with everyone voting now is that we're colliding
[09:47:53] <mikesherov> I have no opinion on 9883
[09:48:08] <mikesherov> did we skip:

[09:48:21] <gnarf> maybe? we can go back to it
[09:48:30] <mikesherov> petro: ye
[09:48:33] <mikesherov> yes*
[09:48:48] <petro> ok got it
[09:48:52] <gnarf> read my last comment on 9384
[09:49:01] <gnarf> I'm kinda +0 leaning toward -1 on it
[09:49:21] <DaveMethvin> on 9384 gnarf you
[09:49:25] <gnarf> though I really do need to sneak in the better .timer() hook to make it a little easier to make it into a plugin
[09:49:30] <DaveMethvin> had talked about just making more extendable
[09:49:32] <DaveMethvin> with less duplication
[09:49:33] <mikesherov> petro, it's for .css('width', 4) automatically does .css('width', '4px')
[09:49:44] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:50:01] <mikesherov> so gnarf: then it's wontfix, but add a separate ticket for 1.9 that accomplshes that goal?
[09:50:01] <petro> right, i'd +1 one that too since it's analogous to cssHooks
[09:50:08] <DaveMethvin> ?9883
[09:50:09] <bot-t> [#9883] Allow users to respond to other ajax event states. (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/9883
[09:50:30] <gnarf> mikesherov: yeah, its actually a simple extension - I'll make my own ticket for 1.9
[09:50:34] <mikesherov> Great
[09:50:36] <DaveMethvin> the problem seems to be that we're asking our "abstraction" to expose the crap out of transport-specific information
[09:50:41] <mikesherov> so close 9384?
[09:50:58] <DaveMethvin> lets close 9384
[09:51:09] <DaveMethvin> since gnarf is gonna clean up the hook for the tick, right?
[09:51:13] <DaveMethvin> that's in a different ticket
[09:51:29] <mikesherov> OK, gnarf: you doing that?
[09:51:40] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12803
[09:52:02] <DaveMethvin> yes
[09:52:38] <DaveMethvin> okay where are we
[09:52:42] <mikesherov> ?9384
[09:52:43] <bot-t> [#9384] jQuery.fx.interval should be replaced by an 'animation-tick' throttling feature. (closed feature: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/9384
[09:52:50] <mikesherov> um, ?9883

[09:53:01] <bot-t> mikesherov, [#9883] Allow users to respond to other ajax event states. (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/9883
[09:53:17] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to see what complexity it adds
[09:53:28] <mikesherov> petro: we're looking at this list btw: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~1.9-discuss&col=id&col=summary&order=priority
[09:53:28] <DaveMethvin> there is so much bulk in our ajax impl now
[09:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm here!
[09:53:38] <gnarf> aww shit
[09:53:41] <DaveMethvin> too late we deprecated UI
[09:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> If everyone wants attropertiethods to die, I'll live with it.
[09:54:06] <gnarf> so, we got 7 minutes left in our time slot, we running long? or should we move specific voting discuss to -dev and finish our agenda
[09:54:28] <mikesherov> I vote to extend!
[09:54:33] <DaveMethvin> I'll close based on votes at 4pm or so
[09:54:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i'd kinda like to go over each one like we've been doin, but maybe there's other business?
[09:54:57] <DaveMethvin> so anything we don't decide here we can deal with it there
[09:55:06] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay time wise for another half  hour
[09:55:41] <gnarf> k
[09:55:43] <DaveMethvin> on 9883 i think we need to know the "cost" in file size and api complexity
[09:55:47] <gnarf> I added a +1 on 9883
[09:55:55] <gnarf> i htink we should at least investigate it
[09:55:56] <DaveMethvin> let's defer that
[09:56:02] <mikesherov> k
[09:56:03] <DaveMethvin> want jaubourgs input
[09:56:10] <mikesherov> ?9885
[09:56:11] <bot-t> [#9885] Add global Ajax beforeSend event (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/9885
[09:56:23] <DaveMethvin> that one i really like
[09:56:28] <DaveMethvin> fired only on document
[09:56:31] <DaveMethvin> not bubbling
[09:56:50] <mikesherov> OK, so adding to milestone
[09:57:06] <mikesherov> ?10417
[09:57:07] <bot-t> [#10417] jQuery.later (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/10417
[09:57:17] <DaveMethvin> okay stop voting on 9883 and i'll assign to 1.9
[09:57:27] <DaveMethvin> oh you did
[09:57:28] <DaveMethvin> good
[09:57:28] <gnarf> heh
[09:57:36] <DaveMethvin> imma let mike edit them
[09:57:45] <gnarf> .later seems to be winning in the votes
[09:57:50] <DaveMethvin> so we liked .later
[09:58:00] <DaveMethvin> didn't seem to save us anything last i looked
[09:58:01] <gnarf> jzaefferer and timmywil had -1's
[09:58:25] <DaveMethvin> i think it would be more compelling if promises were fully async
[09:58:36] <DaveMethvin> since settimeout waits at least 16ms
[09:58:43] <DaveMethvin> but .later could be faster
[09:58:57] <petro> how?
[09:59:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: supposedly they are optimizing for setTimeout( ..., 0 )
[09:59:09] <gnarf> but i keep hearing this
[09:59:12] <gnarf> and it never happens
[09:59:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:59:14] <mikesherov> I'd be +1 if gibson042 found it to be smaller
[09:59:18] <DaveMethvin> they certainly could
[09:59:22] <gnarf> then people do shit like make it 1000ms if the page isn't in focus
[09:59:23] <gnarf> etc
[09:59:25] <gibson042> that depends partly on the name ;)
[09:59:30] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:59:37] <DaveMethvin> jQuery._
[09:59:45] <mikesherov> petro: jQuery.later would pave over setTimeout(fn, 0) and use setImmediate(fn) where available
[09:59:58] <DaveMethvin> or perhaps the postMessage trick
[10:00:09] <gnarf> those all make the size go up tho
[10:00:15] <mikesherov> so, let's try it?
[10:00:16] <gnarf> but actually add a minor benifit
[10:00:20] <DaveMethvin> if someone wants to show it helps and doesn't bloat i'm good with it
[10:00:24] <DaveMethvin> a few bytes is no problem
[10:00:28] <DaveMethvin> 40 bytes would be a lot
[10:00:36] <mikesherov> I'm only for it if it's negative
[10:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> Same here.
[10:00:47] <petro> i'd love to have this functionality (optionally) in deferred resolution as well, but that's another discussion...
[10:00:52] <ryanneufeld> the anon +1 was me
[10:01:00] <gnarf> i mean
[10:01:05] <gnarf> if only we had process.nextTick
[10:01:09] <mikesherov> petro: always async deferred is a can of worms we're not going to discuss at the moment
[10:01:21] <DaveMethvin> tryna make deferreds optionally async is just too crazy, and a global flag is right out
[10:01:21] <petro> i know, i know...
[10:01:40] <DaveMethvin> so anyone want to try an tackle 10417?
[10:01:45] <gnarf> ?10417
[10:01:46] <bot-t> [#10417] jQuery.later (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/10417
[10:01:48] <DaveMethvin> if not let's close as wontfix
[10:01:50] <petro> i can take a look
[10:01:55] <mikesherov> I nominate gibson042
[10:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You have no idea how much discussion there has been around process.nextTick().
[10:01:56] <gnarf> its my crazy plan
[10:02:00] <gnarf> i'll look at it
[10:02:04] <mikesherov> Awesome
[10:02:05] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:02:11] <DaveMethvin> it may be a suicide mission
[10:02:13] <gnarf> perhaps draft gibson042 to help me make it tiny :)
[10:02:43] <gibson042> I'll go for that

[10:05:10] <gnarf> thanks mikesherov
[10:05:15] <mikesherov> It'll be awesome

[10:08:11] <DaveMethvin> he provided code and a decent rationale
[10:08:14] <DaveMethvin> so seems good

[10:09:42] <bot-t> [#12213] Add hook to cleanData to allow cleanup (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/12213
[10:09:54] <mikesherov> I'm ambivalent on this one
[10:10:11] <gnarf> I'm mostly against it
[10:10:14] <DaveMethvin> i can see the utility but it's letting people dig in the guts
[10:10:33] <mikesherov> plugin authors
[10:10:43] <DaveMethvin> i don't like most of the proposed plumbing suggestions in the ticket
[10:10:56] <DaveMethvin> and i know they will make subtree teardown slower
[10:10:59] <gnarf> it's also letting plugin authors slow down some very simple operations
[10:11:19] <DaveMethvin> you can duck punch it now, altho that's undocumented
[10:11:20] <gnarf> I remember when I got yelled at for trying to tackle a problem inside .cleanData
[10:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, it's been a pain to deal with the duck punching in UI.
[10:11:46] <mikesherov> yeah, good point
[10:11:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: would UI benefit greatly from this one?
[10:12:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so now you'd need to deal with duck punching AND whatever we replace
[10:12:16] <mikesherov> and does this slow down the general case where people aren't screwing with cleanData, DaveMethvin ?
[10:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> This is what we do now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L16-24
[10:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> Which is much better now that we don't support jQuery <1.6.
[10:12:49] <DaveMethvin> in 2.0 i was hoping we could just drop the subtree if it didn't have special events
[10:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> We used to do feature detection to determine how to duck punch :-/
[10:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> And since we use events to expose what's going on, we have potential collisions with userland code.
[10:13:29] <DaveMethvin> i haven't thought it all thru to figure out whether it would always slow things down, or just sometimes
[10:13:43] <gnarf> also, that makes fiftyElements.remove() trigger 50 events
[10:13:54] <mikesherov> oh
[10:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it does. At least they don't bubble :-)
[10:14:09] <mikesherov> the duckpunch seems pretty trivial
[10:14:21] <DaveMethvin> events for this is right out
[10:14:23] <gnarf> let alone fiftyElementsWithTenChildren.remove() triggering 500
[10:14:25] <DaveMethvin> way too much overhead
[10:14:34] <DaveMethvin> it would be a callback alone i think
[10:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yes, better than this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L12-41
[10:14:42] <DaveMethvin> but we don't have a mechanism for it
[10:14:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: actually not a lot of overhead
[10:14:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you are already dealing with looking at data on each element
[10:14:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so if we did it inside cleandata
[10:15:01] <DaveMethvin> .triggerHandler("event") ?
[10:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I don't want events, I just want some kind of hook.
[10:15:10] <gnarf> we could just peek at the events and see if it has a remove
[10:15:12] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: right
[10:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> I want to try your suggested workaround with the special event.
[10:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> I just haven't gotten to it yet.
[10:15:26] <mikesherov> OK, so about this ticket....
[10:15:37] <DaveMethvin> if someone wants to try and tackle, great
[10:15:45] <DaveMethvin> it's as much about the design as anything
[10:15:53] <DaveMethvin> we aren't committed to landing anything
[10:15:59] <DaveMethvin> even if it's voted in
[10:16:06] <DaveMethvin> the end result has to make sense
[10:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yes, right now we're looking at the data, but DaveMethvin is hoping that in the future we won't.
[10:16:10] <mikesherov> Right, of course
[10:16:18] <mikesherov> so who's up for looking into it?
[10:16:36] <mikesherov> not me
[10:16:38] <DaveMethvin> not me
[10:16:44] <gibson042> I don't want to come near it
[10:16:47] <DaveMethvin> just a time thing, not opposed
[10:16:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: ?
[10:17:02] <gnarf> I could dig for some inspiration on it
[10:17:08] <mikesherov> Cool
[10:17:11] <gnarf> but i'll prolly punt it
[10:17:11] <mikesherov> thanks gnarf!
[10:17:14] <mikesherov> fair enough
[10:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> As long as cleanData exists, I'm good for now :-P
[10:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to look at the special events idea soon.
[10:17:46] <DaveMethvin> we need to document the undocumnted interfaces
[10:17:51] <DaveMethvin> so we don't break them
[10:17:53] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:18:19] <DaveMethvin> okay, ?12227
[10:18:27] <DaveMethvin> see ?12227
[10:18:28] <bot-t> [#12227]  (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12227
[10:18:51] <mikesherov> there it goes
[10:18:54] <mikesherov> cable is out
[10:19:03] <mikesherov> on my mifi
[10:19:18] <DaveMethvin> ouch
[10:19:25] <DaveMethvin> getting pretty windy here
[10:19:50] <gnarf> We shall forever remember this day as the "sandy vote"
[10:20:09] <gnarf> 12227 - I'd love to see a pull
[10:20:13] <gnarf> who knows
[10:20:20] <gnarf> maybe jdalton would be willing
[10:20:22] <DaveMethvin> it's quite fixable but kind of expensive
[10:20:34] <DaveMethvin> i just hate having to deal with all these general cases
[10:20:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: bytes or ops?
[10:20:41] <DaveMethvin> both kind of
[10:20:53] <DaveMethvin> you have to track which nodes you've visited
[10:21:04] <gnarf> If the fix is "small" I think it's worth fixing
[10:21:07] <DaveMethvin> for our simple uses $.extend is fine
[10:21:19] <mikesherov> hi
[10:21:19] <gnarf> people use our $.extend tho
[10:21:23] <DaveMethvin> but it always seems people are using it for other crap
[10:21:24] <mikesherov> lost power
[10:21:28] <mikesherov> what did I miss
[10:21:36] <DaveMethvin> not much
[10:21:39] <mikesherov> Last I saw was assign gnarf
[10:21:51] <DaveMethvin> we're talking about 12227
[10:21:54] <mikesherov> I see
[10:22:04] <mikesherov> I like leaving it up to lo Dash
[10:22:07] <gnarf> mikesherov: nothing other than me saying that see ?12227 might be worth fixing if the fix is small
[10:22:08] <bot-t> mikesherov, [#12227]  (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12227
[10:22:20] <mikesherov> but the more I think about it, the more I like that it works
[10:22:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah the problem comes when people pass stuff to us that $.extend processes
[10:22:30] <DaveMethvin> like ajax settings, ajax params, etc
[10:22:31] <mikesherov> lots of presentations lately use $.extend
[10:22:55] <gnarf> I still want to try my experimental lo-jQuery branch some day
[10:23:03] <mikesherov> haha
[10:23:04] <gnarf> but like all things... :)
[10:23:15] <DaveMethvin> someone did a fix
[10:23:20] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: do you recall?
[10:23:33] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/665 was for similar work in $.param and would have added +48 gzipped
[10:23:44] <DaveMethvin> i just  hate that we're being pulled into lodash territory
[10:24:07] <mikesherov> plus JDD would gladly help
[10:24:15] <mikesherov> so....
[10:24:22] <mikesherov> well, it's our fault
[10:24:25] <DaveMethvin> mark it for 1.9 and we can ask him
[10:24:29] <mikesherov> don't make $.extend public
[10:24:29] <DaveMethvin> assign it to me
[10:24:29] <gnarf> lets see if jdalton can give us a better $.extend then?
[10:24:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:24:40] <petro> what about making $.extend optionally check for circulars
[10:24:43] <mikesherov> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[10:24:49] <DaveMethvin> no no no optional
[10:24:54] <gibson042> lol
[10:24:54] <mikesherov> not optional
[10:24:59] <gibson042> jQuery.safeExtend :P
[10:25:07] <mikesherov> petro: we're trying to remove options, not add them :-)
[10:25:13] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.extend(true, true, ...)
[10:25:16] <mikesherov> jQuery.quickReady
[10:25:16] <petro> just playing devil's advocate it's such an edge
[10:25:20] <mikesherov> sure
[10:25:22] <petro> *edge case
[10:25:33] <mikesherov> makes sense petro
[10:25:52] <mikesherov> ok, next

[10:27:08] <gnarf> btw - added some columns to http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~1.9-discuss&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority - useful!
[10:27:21] <DaveMethvin> serializeArray dickin around, nay
[10:27:29] <gnarf> see ?12264 hrm
[10:27:30] <bot-t> [#12264] Allow users customize the return obj in the serializeArray (type: ""text""} value: ""1"") - http://jqbug.com/12264
[10:27:46] <DaveMethvin> i have about 3 minutes
[10:27:51] <gnarf> yeah
[10:27:52] <gnarf> .map
[10:27:57] <DaveMethvin> but we got a lot done, so well worth it
[10:27:59] <gnarf> close it
[10:28:04] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:28:35] <gnarf> can i move see ?12397 up cuz its my ticket?
[10:28:36] <bot-t> [#12397] Allow passing a function to .data() as an each style setter. (because you want to set that key to a function... fn ) }}} signature) - http://jqbug.com/12397
[10:29:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah, karl had reservations on this too because it's a unique signature and kind of a pain to doc
[10:29:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its each?
[10:29:25] <DaveMethvin> i think this would be another good sig for the one-liners that gibson042
[10:29:27] <DaveMethvin> mentioned
[10:29:57] <mikesherov> so
[10:30:00] <DaveMethvin> the sig and semantics aren't the same as the getter/settter use of functions as an arg
[10:30:05] <mikesherov> yeah
[10:30:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: but it's each....
[10:30:29] <DaveMethvin> .setter(name, func)
[10:30:34] <DaveMethvin> .data(func)
[10:30:42] <gnarf> i see the point
[10:30:53] <gnarf> but its .each(func) but you get data instead of elem
[10:31:03] <gnarf> index,data instead of index,elem
[10:31:13] <DaveMethvin> it's worthwhile but i don't know it belngs in core
[10:31:23] <DaveMethvin> same with the array ops
[10:31:39] <mikesherov> I liked it. But DaveMethvin makes a good point
[10:31:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: cool - gnarf/jquery-data it is then :)
[10:31:51] <DaveMethvin> i think we just need a place to put stuff like this that isn't core
[10:31:55] <DaveMethvin> but is accessible
[10:32:00] <gnarf> the plugins site?
[10:32:03] <mikesherov> like gibson042 mentioned
[10:32:08] <DaveMethvin> could be, it's almost like mini-plugins
[10:32:19] <mikesherov> ?12530
[10:32:20] <bot-t> [#12530] $.fn.css return values for background-color (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12530
[10:32:23] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we could have a site with a builder that would bjundle them
[10:32:24] <kswedberg> how about learn.jquery.com? there could be a whole section on one-liners with explanations, etc.
[10:32:24] <gibson042> I knew we'd come full circle :)
[10:32:25] <mikesherov> closing
[10:32:32] <mikesherov> kswedberg: +1
[10:32:34] <gibson042> DaveMethvin YES +1
[10:33:03] <DaveMethvin> 12350, the Color plugin?
[10:33:07] <mikesherov> 3 left
[10:33:14] <mikesherov> let's just get through these
[10:33:20] <mikesherov> ?12639
[10:33:21] <bot-t> [#12639]  (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/12639
[10:33:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: $.Color( element, "background-color" ).is( "transparent" )
[10:33:52] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12639
[10:34:01] <mikesherov> MAKE TOGGLECLASS('ACTIVE', FUNCTION() { RETURN BOOL; }) WORK
[10:34:10] <gnarf> mikesherov: i had a concern about the arguments passed to callback
[10:34:13] <mikesherov> I say yes for parity
[10:34:36] <DaveMethvin> consistency, since we already hosed ourselves everywhere else
[10:34:55] <DaveMethvin> does it break the UI toggleclass?
[10:35:00] <mikesherov> wait
[10:35:03] <mikesherov> I read this wrong
[10:35:10] <mikesherov> I thought this was about parity with the getter
[10:35:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, toggleClass duck punch issues scare me on 12639 too
[10:35:48] <DaveMethvin> just like outerWidth again
[10:35:52] <gnarf> only one left DaveMethvin see ?12734
[10:35:53] <bot-t> [#12734]  ( fn);) - http://jqbug.com/12734
[10:36:15] <DaveMethvin> i meant to vote no, will now
[10:36:45] <mikesherov> so what was the decision on 12639?
[10:36:57] <DaveMethvin> no?
[10:37:19] <DaveMethvin> concern about ui duck punch on the same name
[10:37:30] <DaveMethvin> dunno if that might change our desire on that
[10:37:52] <mikesherov> yeah, let's wontfix
[10:37:59] <DaveMethvin> just voted on it
[10:38:11] <mikesherov> we'd have to do same thing for .toggle
[10:38:18] <mikesherov> which god knows doesn't need another sig
[10:38:22] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:38:24] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[10:38:52] <mikesherov> ?12734
[10:38:53] <bot-t> [#12734]  ( fn);) - http://jqbug.com/12734
[10:39:06] <DaveMethvin> i'm no on those
[10:39:15] <DaveMethvin> i don't see a lot of benefit
[10:39:27] <DaveMethvin> how often do you need to trigger multiple synth events?
[10:39:38] <DaveMethvin> it's just extra crap to me
[10:39:45] <mikesherov> Only argument for is feature parity
[10:40:04] <DaveMethvin> but triggering events and setting classes are different tings
[10:40:05] <DaveMethvin> things
[10:40:07] <gibson042> mikesherov with what?
[10:40:08] <mikesherov> sure
[10:40:11] <mikesherov> I dunno
[10:40:13] <mikesherov> other things
[10:40:13] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:40:15] <mikesherov> :-P
[10:40:34] <DaveMethvin> man it's getting BLOWY around here
[10:40:44] <mikesherov> so wontfix?
[10:40:44] <DaveMethvin> cmon power, hold out
[10:40:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think so
[10:41:11] <mikesherov> well, that's it then!
[10:41:14] <DaveMethvin> my meeting got delayed a bit waiting for it to start
[10:41:18] <DaveMethvin> great!
[10:41:30] <DaveMethvin> lessee what else is there
[10:41:37] <DaveMethvin> mainly let's get going on 1.9
[10:41:46] <DaveMethvin> now that we know what tix are open that will help
[10:42:07] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&milestone=1.9&group=status&order=priority&report=507
[10:42:15] <mikesherov> this is all of them
[10:42:28] <DaveMethvin> thanks mikesherov!
[10:42:28] <mikesherov> we should do another triage sweep just to see if there are any stragglers
[10:42:30] <mikesherov> but not now
[10:42:40] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/report/507
[10:42:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, nice work guys
[10:43:16] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta go, i'll be in -dev this afternoon
[10:43:28] <mikesherov> bye!
[10:43:36] <mikesherov> thanks petro for attending
