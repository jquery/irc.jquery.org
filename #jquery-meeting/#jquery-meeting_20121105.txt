[09:02:11] <DaveMethvin> meeting time!
[09:02:28] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov timmywil rwaldron etc etc
[09:04:02] <DaveMethvin> (crickets)
[09:04:07] <mikesherov> hi
[09:04:18] <ryanneufeld> pong
[09:04:24] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov have you been into manhattan yet?
[09:04:35] <mikesherov> I'm there right now
[09:04:37] <DaveMethvin> hey ryanneufeld
[09:05:00] <DaveMethvin> a post-apocolyptic scene?
[09:05:33] <mikesherov> not really
[09:05:36] <mikesherov> midtown is fine
[09:05:52] <DaveMethvin> and i guess they have power south of you now
[09:06:30] <DaveMethvin> okay so the agenda
[09:06:45] <DaveMethvin> gnarf wants to get that animation regression out soon
[09:06:57] <mikesherov> and do a 1.8.3?
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:07:28] <DaveMethvin> so i didn't want to rush it too hard, perhaps put it out next week?
[09:07:34] <mikesherov> sure
[09:07:44] <DaveMethvin> since gnarf is going to be in korea he wanted to say it's fixed
[09:07:59] <timmywil> yo
[09:08:09] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: ho
[09:08:19] <DaveMethvin> ok so 1.8.3 next week
[09:08:36] <DaveMethvin> i created the jquery-compat plugin over the weekend
[09:08:44] <DaveMethvin> still needs lots of cleanup but it's mostly there
[09:08:51] <DaveMethvin> passing the unit tests i stole
[09:09:29] <DaveMethvin> oh did i give everyone commit on it?
[09:09:31] <timmywil> actually I gotta run, I'll be back in about an hour
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[09:09:33] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:10:18] <DaveMethvin> ok all core committers have full access now
[09:10:34] <gnarf> hey hey
[09:10:42] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[09:10:59] <mikesherov> great
[09:11:12] <mikesherov> I haven't been very active on compat yet
[09:11:18] <DaveMethvin> how would you like to triage bugs on this repo?
[09:11:28] <DaveMethvin> we could do Trac or switch to Github issues
[09:11:41] <mikesherov> for compat?
[09:11:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:11:49] <DaveMethvin> i had thought Trac
[09:11:55] <mikesherov> I think only core and ui should continue to use trac
[09:12:05] <DaveMethvin> that's why i asked :D
[09:12:23] <mikesherov> and that's mainly for historical purposes and ticket numbers, and ticket graph
[09:12:26] <DaveMethvin> works for me
[09:12:32] <mikesherov> I love that ticketgraph!
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> okay then, we'll go github issues
[09:13:01] <mikesherov> Gr8
[09:13:38] <DaveMethvin> and take a look when you get a chance, I'll open a few tix related to the undone stuff
[09:14:09] <DaveMethvin> my thought is that the uncompressed dev version should be able to be included with pretty old versions of jquery
[09:14:21] <DaveMethvin> that way you could get console messages to help you upgrade
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> then the minified version will chop that stuff out
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> it's not being chopped out yet but i think Uglify's dead code elimination can do it for free
[09:14:55] <gibson042> how do we want to track compatibility with different jQuery public APIs? branch?
[09:15:13] <DaveMethvin> you mean unit tests gibson042?
[09:15:20] <gibson042> no, the plugin itself
[09:15:34] <DaveMethvin> across different versions?
[09:15:36] <gibson042> i.e., this is a plugin that makes jQuery act like 1.8
[09:15:44] <mikesherov> do what UI
[09:15:46] <mikesherov> does*
[09:16:13] <DaveMethvin> i was figuring we'd have this include all the removed functionality
[09:16:18] <DaveMethvin> so there's only one version
[09:16:31] <DaveMethvin> and, um, "all" is probably the wrong word
[09:16:33] <gibson042> but what about when we need a plugin to make 2.1 act like 2.0?
[09:16:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't know what that will look like yet
[09:16:52] <gibson042> it's still official compat
[09:17:00] <DaveMethvin> but if it's new apis  no problem
[09:17:09] <DaveMethvin> if it's removed stuff the removed stuff would go into -compat
[09:17:32] <DaveMethvin> so, like, i tested jquery-compat with 1.7.2 and it just punches in functionality over the existing stuff
[09:17:44] <DaveMethvin> even tho the existing stuff worked
[09:17:51] <DaveMethvin> but now it will yell at them on the console
[09:18:15] <gibson042> right, we're making jQuery-xxx act like jQuery-1.8.2
[09:18:22] <gibson042> with the latter information being relevant
[09:18:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah, basically
[09:18:44] <gibson042> and in the future we'll want to do the same, but making jQuery act like -2.0 etc.
[09:18:57] <DaveMethvin> so we don't support a plugin to make 1.6 look like 1.4 etc, yeah
[09:19:10] <gibson042> so I'm asking now if it's better to branch or better to name the repository by the jquery version being emulated
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> originally i did that and thought it was too confusing and limiting
[09:19:32] <gibson042> jquery-compat-1.8 etc.
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> in fact i have to remove the jquery-compat-1.9 repo
[09:19:59] <gibson042> so the current plan will be to branch when we come to that bridge?
[09:20:16] <DaveMethvin> i'd say lets try not to branch
[09:20:24] <DaveMethvin> but it depends on what changes are made
[09:20:56] <DaveMethvin> so the idea is that someone would come in with code from jquery 1.x and want to know what they
[09:21:02] <DaveMethvin> have to do to make it run with the current version
[09:21:13] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it will be as easy as putting in the plugin
[09:21:17] <gibson042> I was thinking more in the forward direction, but yeah
[09:21:20] <DaveMethvin> other times we say "you're screwed"
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:21:39] <DaveMethvin> like with .after() on detached elements
[09:22:00] <DaveMethvin> we might tell them it's not supported anymore and point them to a plugin, or we could try to shim it
[09:22:17] <mikesherov> makes sense
[09:22:28] <gibson042> yep
[09:22:40] <DaveMethvin> that is, the jquery-compat plugin would have a message like "JQCOMPAT: .after() on detached elems is deprecated"
[09:23:06] <DaveMethvin> ok next
[09:23:17] <DaveMethvin> so we talked about a one-liner or tiny plugin repo
[09:23:19] <DaveMethvin> last week
[09:23:27] <DaveMethvin> what should we do there?
[09:23:33] <DaveMethvin> i didn't write it down
[09:24:08] <DaveMethvin> learn.jquery.com sounds enticing but it's not a good way to support code vs docs
[09:24:12] <gibson042> IIRC the decision was to keep things in our own repos and not do anything official other than provide links
[09:24:28] <DaveMethvin> i vaguely remembered that
[09:24:36] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's stay with that
[09:25:01] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: anything to report on mergatron?
[09:25:45] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: were you going to do anything on the speed tests?
[09:26:00] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: mergeatron is middle of this week
[09:26:06] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[09:26:10] <gnarf> nope, doubt I'll have much time for it this week, was waiting on mikesherov to finish the sqllite modification instead of mongo
[09:26:28] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:26:31] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: speed tests I held off on because rwaldron wanted to revive dromareooeooeo or whatever it's called
[09:26:44] <DaveMethvin> ok well then we should bug rwaldron
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> i'll take that todo
[09:26:52] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:27:34] <DaveMethvin> okay, tix
[09:28:00] <DaveMethvin> got a few things in the pull q, i had gotten it down pretty low before the weekend
[09:28:24] <mikesherov> coopersemantics signed CLA
[09:28:31] <mikesherov> I talked to him, so that's ready to pull in
[09:28:53] <DaveMethvin> imma hijack docs#11737 for the removal of all the jquery-compat code from core
[09:28:54] <bot-t> [#11737] Remove jQuery.sub (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/11737
[09:29:19] <DaveMethvin> i'd still like to avoid adding a bunch of code to extend on docs#12227
[09:29:20] <bot-t> [#12227]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/12227
[09:30:15] <DaveMethvin> docs#10462
[09:30:16] <bot-t> [#10462] animate with stop calls in succession react synchronously to asynchronous actions (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10462
[09:30:42] <DaveMethvin> fracmak2 has it but i don't think he was planning on a fix, just reported some more useful info
[09:30:53] <gnarf> mikesherov: have you had a chance to review my pull for that toggle bug?
[09:31:01] <mikesherov> Not thoroughly
[09:31:11] <mikesherov> I will in a bit today
[09:32:00] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: all your assigned tix already have pulls i think
[09:32:07] <gnarf> I really think Sinon would make this test case like 100* easier
[09:32:25] <gnarf> but - I suppose the one I wrote works...
[09:32:41] <DaveMethvin> gnarf i'm good with something better for 1.9, don't really want to do a lot of changes for 1.8.3
[09:33:00] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: they aren't like code changes - they are test changes
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> oh and those NEVER go wrong :D
[09:33:16] <gnarf> :)
[09:33:36] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: using a mocking and stubbing framework seems like not a bad idea to at least try out
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[09:33:58] <DaveMethvin> certainly woud seem to get rid of a lot of the timing issues in animation/ajax
[09:34:08] <DaveMethvin> altho we prolly still need to deal with them in ajax
[09:34:10] <gibson042> yeah, I'm going to leave the domManip pull open a little longer, but I'm ready to land the other two (removing .attr( obj, true ) and passing QUnit check for globals) unless someone raises a flag today
[09:34:29] <mikesherov> cool
[09:35:01] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: there are a bunch of open tix in animation, how does your time look for reviewing/fixing those?
[09:35:18] <gnarf> this week is terrible
[09:35:30] <DaveMethvin> next week is korea, right?
[09:35:34] <gnarf> up until I get back from Korea, not much time
[09:35:34] <gnarf> yeah
[09:35:39] <gnarf> should be back late Wed
[09:36:07] <DaveMethvin> ok, maybe we can get some other folks to look at a few of these
[09:36:28] <gnarf> I'll gladly take a quick look and toss any ideas that come to a head
[09:36:43] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: how about your assigned tix? Any eta on those?
[09:37:02] <gnarf> I might have time for a few bugfixes in the air
[09:37:08] <gnarf> 14 hr plane rides and all
[09:37:20] <DaveMethvin> i hope they have ac power
[09:37:46] <gnarf> the air can hold out for about 6 hours, i figure I'll try to nap part of it and also bring a few books :)
[09:38:14] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: one sec
[09:39:05] <mikesherov> I have 4 tixx, should be able to get to both of the actual coding tixx this week
[09:39:17] <mikesherov> ?12267
[09:39:18] <bot-t> [#12267] investigate Making “offset” and “dimensions” modules independent of “css” module (assigned feature) - http://jqbug.com/12267
[09:39:26] <mikesherov> is most likely a wontfix
[09:39:28] <mikesherov> but I'll see
[09:39:31] <DaveMethvin> which is fine if it is
[09:39:52] <DaveMethvin> the important think is the ticket gets closed :)
[09:39:56] <DaveMethvin> thing*
[09:40:11] <DaveMethvin> okay, i think that's about it
[09:40:22] <DaveMethvin> any other issues you guys want to talk about?
[09:40:35] <DaveMethvin> we're making some really good progress
[09:40:53] <DaveMethvin> does it seem realistic to have a 1.9 beta out say the week after Thanksgiving?
[09:41:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: got a report you want me to do a quick review of?
[09:41:18] <mikesherov> we should rebalance the 1.9 tixx next week
[09:41:33] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&milestone=1.9&group=status&order=priority&report=507
[09:42:28] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: agreed on the 1.9 tix review next week, let's figure out what is still left to be done
[09:42:55] <mikesherov> Well, we also have a boatload of tixx on rwaldron
[09:42:58] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to tell people, "load 1.9 and the jquery-compat plugin and see what it says"
[09:43:01] <mikesherov> that aren't 1.9 per so
[09:43:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah that rwaldron
[09:43:14] <DaveMethvin> some of them are metas so they're mainly sittin and thinkin tix
[09:43:29] <DaveMethvin> oh, need to add one for the new "single element api" idea
[09:43:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that
[09:46:30] <gibson042> looking at those tickets, I think a post-Thanksgiving beta makes sense
[09:46:54] <gibson042> but it'll probably mean deferring/wontfixing a lot of the wishlist items
[09:47:00] <DaveMethvin> also, the sooner we get 1.9 into shape the sooner it makes sense to fork it so we can start on 2.0
[09:47:12] <DaveMethvin> i don't have a problem with deferring a lot of the internal stuff
[09:47:15] <gibson042> not that I consider that a bad thing
[09:47:44] <DaveMethvin> we will have plenty of opportunities to reorg and refactor 2.x code
[09:48:11] <DaveMethvin> okay then, i guess we  have nothing left to do but finish all these tickets!
[09:48:39] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys
[09:51:32] * DaveMethvin closes door and turns out light
