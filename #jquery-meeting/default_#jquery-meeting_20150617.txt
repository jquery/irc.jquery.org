[09:07:54] <arschmitz> Hi
[09:07:58] * rxaviers on standby
[09:08:00] <rxaviers> Hi
[09:08:06] <fnagel1> hey
[09:08:26] <jzaefferer> Looks like Scott isn't around again, I haven't yet updated the agenda
[09:08:43] <jzaefferer> arschmitz, can you start with your items?
[09:08:50] <arschmitz> Sure
[09:09:04] <arschmitz> Button is all updated from its last review
[09:09:25] <arschmitz> so it needs another round of review from scott
[09:09:52] <arschmitz> I submitted a PR for fixing the issues with core now that they fixed their part
[09:10:29] <arschmitz> The changes to jqueryui.com are all updated
[09:10:30] <jzaefferer> this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1565
[09:10:36] <jzaefferer> oh, 7 minutes ago
[09:10:43] <arschmitz> yes
[09:10:46] <jzaefferer> that explains why I hadn't yet seen that
[09:10:54] <arschmitz> yeah core was just fixed yesterday
[09:11:31] <arschmitz> spinner i know you said your ok with
[09:11:34] <arschmitz> waiting on scott
[09:12:03] <arschmitz> still working on updating the rest of the demos
[09:12:22] <jzaefferer> this doesn't look updated: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/113/files
[09:12:31] <arschmitz> oh opps i guess i didnt push it
[09:12:33] <jzaefferer> missing push?
[09:12:35] <arschmitz> ill do it after
[09:12:52] <arschmitz> but it cant land until we update the demos in jquery-ui first
[09:13:12] <arschmitz> or we wont be able to build the current demos
[09:13:29] <arschmitz> actually it will need to land on a 1.5 branch i imagine
[09:13:48] <jzaefferer> so we can only land it when we release 1.12 as stable?
[09:14:12] <arschmitz> yes
[09:14:18] <jzaefferer> oh well
[09:14:30] <jzaefferer> should do a beta release very soon then
[09:14:36] <arschmitz> yes
[09:15:08] <arschmitz> i have a PR on mouse wheel you made some minor comments on
[09:15:25] <arschmitz> that gets us closer to testing by default against a custom jquery
[09:15:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how's your schedule to address the DB issues?
[09:15:57] <jzaefferer> fnagel1: how's datepicker doing?
[09:16:30] <rxaviers> busy. I may be able to begin something in 2-3days. But, I expect to have an answer by a week
[09:16:59] <fnagel> jzaefferer: waiting for scott_gonzalez rebase (we need AMD for Globalize)
[09:17:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: once the major UI PRs are in master that seems like the only remaining blocker
[09:17:06] <jzaefferer> so you still have a few days ;-)
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> Yeah i expect at least a few more rounds of review with scott
[09:17:43] <arschmitz> he has only reviewed the first 3 commits so far
[09:17:46] <arschmitz> for button
[09:18:00] <jzaefferer> I see
[09:18:15] <jzaefferer> fnagel1: that is a rebase of the datepicker branch against master?
[09:18:55] <fnagel> jepp
[09:20:35] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:20:46] <jzaefferer> I guess that's still far from automatic...
[09:21:25] <jzaefferer> Afaik we've got the button and spinner PRs on UI and the DB CSS changes before we can do a 1.12 beta.
[09:21:31] <jzaefferer> Any other blockers?
[09:21:54] <jzaefferer> the position/offset fix looks simple enough, that should be long done before those others
[09:22:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:22:32] <arschmitz> demos and core probably should be done
[09:23:03] <arschmitz> breaking up of core that is
[09:23:40] <arschmitz> but both are fairly simple and shoould be able to be done by then
[09:23:45] <jzaefferer> well, we still haven't even started that
[09:24:08] <jzaefferer> demos don't really matter for the beta, since we don't update demos until the final release (for better or worse)
[09:24:21] <arschmitz> yes but its trivial break up into modules and just adjust dependencies
[09:24:35] <arschmitz> its just waiting on the demos
[09:24:43] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:25:17] <arschmitz> i dont mind doing it once demos lands
[09:25:34] <arschmitz> i know scott_gonzalez was going to but id rather him review my stuff lol
[09:26:00] <jzaefferer> yeah, let's not assign more to him
[09:26:29] <jzaefferer> anything new about the toggle button a11y issue?
[09:26:33] <arschmitz> no
[09:26:59] <arschmitz> my gut feeling is we should go with labels[ labels.length -1 ] by default instead of 0
[09:27:30] <arschmitz> but really my test case actually shows its easy enought to get that format even using 0 so eh
[09:27:45] <arschmitz> just requires some fancy floats lol
[09:28:05] <jzaefferer> okay, I don't know enough about the issue to discuss that
[09:29:01] <arschmitz> well what we do and the a11y thread are actually kinda seperate
[09:29:17] <arschmitz> but anyway
[09:31:32] <jzaefferer> well, then go with 0!
[09:31:35] <jzaefferer> whatever that means
[09:32:13] <arschmitz> lol
[09:32:37] <arschmitz> basicly should we make the button out of the first label the last label or make it an option is what we are trying to figured out
[09:32:58] <arschmitz> i dont think any one wants an option
[09:33:26] <arschmitz> we originally decided go with first
[09:33:38] <arschmitz> but that can make some common form layouts kinda tricky
[09:34:19] <jzaefferer> How common is it to have more than one label?
[09:34:22] <arschmitz> like this one with a label on the left http://jsbin.com/muceye/1/edit?html,output
[09:34:27] <arschmitz> its not at all
[09:34:46] <arschmitz> but its the only way to make the first example there work properly
[09:35:08] <arschmitz> well properly if you expect clicking th label to toggle
[09:35:17] <arschmitz> which is what we were asking webaim / fluid about
[09:35:33] <arschmitz> if it should work like the first one or the second one in the jsbin
[09:36:07] <arschmitz> if the answer is the second this is a non issue use 0
[09:36:34] <arschmitz> if the answer is the first it becomes slightly more complicated
[09:37:21] <jzaefferer> I like the first one
[09:37:46] <arschmitz> on webaim one person said they would expect the first one said the second
[09:37:50] <arschmitz> no answer from fluid
[09:37:50] <jzaefferer> I dislike breaking the ability to click the label to focus an input
[09:38:06] <jzaefferer> should also work for checkbox toggling
[09:38:29] <arschmitz> i guess the thing was once it becomes button like people dont see it the same way any more
[09:38:37] <arschmitz> was the justification for why it should be the second
[09:38:57] <arschmitz> so by doing labels.length - 1
[09:39:03] <arschmitz> it makes the first very easy
[09:39:13] <arschmitz> with out lots of custom css
[09:39:32] <arschmitz> but it makes some other hypothetical layouts harder where you want the label on the right
[09:40:09] <arschmitz> and that would be the justification for make an option to specificy exactly what label to use when their are multiple.
[09:40:20] <arschmitz> to accomodate complicated multi label layouts
[09:40:30] <jzaefferer> let's ignore the hypotheticals and adjust later if anyone complains?
[09:40:35] <jzaefferer> Always easier to add options than to remove them
[09:40:46] <arschmitz> yup i agree i dont want to add an option
[09:40:58] <arschmitz> but i am inclined to lean towards length - 1
[09:41:05] <arschmitz> since the layout in the jsbin is pretty common
[09:41:12] <arschmitz> we specificly support it in jQuery mobile
[09:41:29] <jzaefferer> okay, let's do that
[09:41:38] <arschmitz> as a side not screen reader support for multiple labels is pretty terrible
[09:41:51] <arschmitz> but nothing we can do about that
[09:42:20] <jzaefferer> good reason not do use multiple labels
[09:42:28] <jzaefferer> which came up on jQuery Validation, too
[09:42:43] <arschmitz> i dont think we should really advocate using it with multiple labels but for layouts like that i think its important to handle the situation gracefully since it is valid markup
[09:42:57] <jzaefferer> still uses <label class="error"> by default, but will change that in a hypothetical 2.0
[09:43:12] <jzaefferer> yeah, that makes sense
[09:43:46] <jzaefferer> can you work with that?
[09:44:00] <arschmitz> yes its a trivial change
[09:44:06] <jzaefferer> okay, great.
[09:44:08] <arschmitz> we just needed to make a decision
[09:44:10] <jzaefferer> I think that's all for today
[09:44:19] <arschmitz> its just changing 0 to length - 1 basicly
[09:44:30] <arschmitz> cool i have to run in a few minutes anyway
[09:44:55] <jzaefferer> Alright, thanks everyone!
[10:00:11] <arthurvr> hey there
[10:00:24] <agcolom> hey! Good afternoon everyone
[10:00:28] <arthurvr> `contentteam
[10:00:36] <arthurvr> arg b-ot :p
[10:00:40] <agcolom> :-(
[10:00:46] <arschmitz> lost all saved tings
[10:00:49] <arschmitz> need to add them again
[10:01:04] <arthurvr> kswedberg you around?
[10:01:08] <arthurvr> Aurelio doesn’t seem to be here
[10:01:43] <agcolom> let's get started
[10:01:53] <agcolom> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BtIFF5R_djDCAtwJQiIxy3oOxdQeyrogWFoSvybFHA/edit#
[10:01:55] <arthurvr> yeah
[10:02:20] <kswedberg> hey arthurvr. just got in. :)
[10:02:35] <arthurvr> hey hey
[10:02:43] <agcolom> so been busy with work, but Kris pushed his branch for the changes to the various foundation pages,
[10:02:56] <agcolom> and been able to add to that...
[10:03:02] <arthurvr> link?
[10:03:07] <agcolom> Isaac will help also with design and graphics
[10:03:12] <arthurvr> woohoo :)
[10:03:14] <agcolom> hi kswedberg :-)
[10:03:26] <kswedberg> hey hey agcolom!
[10:03:57] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org
[10:04:12] <agcolom> no sorry...
[10:05:14] <agcolom> https://github.com/kborchers/jquery.org/tree/reorg
[10:05:27] <arthurvr> oh on his fork. missed that :) Thanks!
[10:05:29] <agcolom> there are also changes to the jquery-wp-content for that
[10:06:03] <arthurvr> awesome
[10:06:45] <agcolom> so project pages will maintain their own team page
[10:07:29] <agcolom> but as we do not have a project and we're a dept, we will be on the foundation team page with something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7v1mheh3bfl5ux/Screenshot%202015-06-12%2013.57.11.png?dl=0
[10:07:42] <agcolom> (it's a 1st draft ;-) )
[10:07:46] <arthurvr> That looks great
[10:08:31] <kswedberg> nice
[10:08:35] <agcolom> we're still tweaking style etc. and should also get some help from isaac to make some nice punchy graphics to the main .org page
[10:08:56] <agcolom> other than that, nothing from me...
[10:09:10] <agcolom> will be meeting kswedberg soon ;-)
[10:09:26] <kswedberg> yahoo!
[10:09:36] <arthurvr> about the team page, shouldn’t addy be on that as well?
[10:09:39] <agcolom> sorry if I look like a zombie ;-)
[10:09:47] <agcolom> yes, good point!
[10:09:49] <arthurvr> haha :p have fun y’all :) Where?
[10:10:10] <agcolom> I'll add him also... I did pay more attention to the other depts ;-)
[10:10:11] <kswedberg> arthurvr: san francisco (jquerysf.com)
[10:10:13] <agcolom> in SF!
[10:10:22] <agcolom> 8h time difference!
[10:10:37] <arthurvr> should probably ask him if he’s still interested anyways I didn’t see him contributing to content repos for quite a while
[10:10:40] <arthurvr> wooo awesome!
[10:11:45] <arthurvr> how bunch of great speakers at jQuery SF by the way
[10:11:57] <agcolom> ok, Arthur did you put the other items on hte agenda?
[10:12:15] <agcolom> indeed! we'll be meeting sfrisk also :-)
[10:12:21] <sfrisk> :-D
[10:12:29] <sfrisk> I get to meet people!
[10:12:33] <agcolom> yay!
[10:12:45] <kswedberg> cool!
[10:13:19] <agcolom> ok, next item...
[10:13:19] <agcolom> Should we consider setting up http -> https redirects for all sites?
[10:13:29] <agcolom> arthurvr: was this from you?
[10:13:46] <arthurvr> yea I added tow small things
[10:13:51] <arthurvr> we had a really quick discussion on github about that
[10:13:53] <arthurvr> cc gnarf
[10:13:59] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/118
[10:14:13] <kswedberg> seems like more of an infrastructure issue, no?
[10:14:35] <gnarf> It's more of a question
[10:14:39] <gnarf> it's easy enough to actually do
[10:14:41] <gnarf> but do we want to
[10:14:52] <kswedberg> ohaignarf!
[10:14:55] <gnarf> is there an actual benefit to going https only?
[10:15:03] <agcolom> Hey gnarf!
[10:15:05] <arthurvr> well isn’t it just a case of promoting best practices?
[10:15:21] <arthurvr> and to clarify it’s just about the redirect we already have `https` enabled and working
[10:15:58] <gnarf> i don't think it is actually best practice to serve https only on content that doesn't have personal information cookies
[10:16:11] <gnarf> i might be wrong and out of date with those practices tho
[10:16:27] <agcolom> I'm not the best person to answer. I don't know
[10:16:49] <agcolom> who would be the best person to ask?
[10:16:53] <arthurvr> my feeling was that it’s just a case of use it whenever you can and as much as possible
[10:16:55] <arthurvr> http://mashable.com/2011/05/31/https-web-security/
[10:18:07] <gnarf> arthurvr: I don't see any of that applying to cached content on a mostly static webpage that noone "logs in" to
[10:18:17] <gnarf> we don't track personal info in cookies either
[10:18:25] <AurelioDeRosa_> Hi everyone. Sorry, I'm quite late today
[10:18:27] <kswedberg> http://jquerysf.com/speaker/Emily-Stark.html
[10:18:34] <agcolom> Hi AurelioDeRosa_ :-)
[10:18:47] <arthurvr> haha yeah kswedberg
[10:18:51] <arthurvr> hey AurelioDeRosa_
[10:19:09] <AurelioDeRosa_> Did I miss anything important?
[10:19:12] <kswedberg> maybe we should wait and have a talk with Emily Stark first? :)
[10:19:19] <arthurvr> yeah why not
[10:19:40] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa_: you should really ask gnarf if you’re able to join our ZNC club :p
[10:19:54] <gnarf> kswedberg: or would someone e-mail her and ask her to weigh in about it on the issue?
[10:20:14] <gnarf> is anyone actually going to be at jQuery SF to ask her?
[10:20:44] <kswedberg> gnarf: sfrisk, agcolom, and I will be there
[10:20:51] <sfrisk> Nice!
[10:21:09] <AurelioDeRosa_> ZNC stands for? :D
[10:21:09] <gnarf> kswedberg: I'm happy to turn it on, just not sure we need it or want it... :)
[10:21:20] <agcolom> ok, so let's ask her
[10:21:31] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa_: ZNC is a IRC bouncer - it connects to freenode as you, then you connect to it and it keeps a "buffer"
[10:21:46] <arthurvr> and then you’re around when I want to ask you things AurelioDeRosa_ :p
[10:22:06] <AurelioDeRosa_> Seems legit :)
[10:22:48] <gnarf> AurelioDeRosa_: i have a super busy day today, remind me sometime soon to set you up?
[10:22:51] <gnarf> or s5fs ;)
[10:23:02] <AurelioDeRosa_> Sure thing. Thank you @gnarf
[10:23:22] <kswedberg> ok, agcolom or I or both will talk to Emily Stark at jquerysf unless someone gets to her sooner.
[10:23:31] <arthurvr> awesome
[10:23:59] <agcolom> Yes, I added this to the notes also.
[10:24:13] <agcolom> next item: Should we review all our sites on mobile?
[10:24:28] <agcolom> was that from arthurvr or AurelioDeRosa_?
[10:24:34] <arthurvr> yes we should :p many of them are really screwed up
[10:24:49] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/102 is just an example
[10:24:54] <agcolom> yes indeed. and the api sites also
[10:24:55] <AurelioDeRosa_> I agree on that. Mobile is too important to avoid it
[10:25:11] <AurelioDeRosa_> @agcolom
[10:25:21] <AurelioDeRosa_> I think last issue was from m
[10:25:36] <AurelioDeRosa_> But it seems that it's a very well known issue
[10:25:56] <agcolom> yes,
[10:26:00] <arthurvr> yup
[10:26:15] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa_: is that something you're happy to look into?
[10:26:31] <AurelioDeRosa_> Do you mean this specific issue or the whole website?
[10:26:38] <AurelioDeRosa_> I'm fine with both
[10:26:39] <agcolom> the whole websites
[10:26:52] <agcolom> cool!
[10:27:02] <arthurvr> awesomesauce
[10:27:04] <AurelioDeRosa_> Perfect, I'll do that and report any issue I find on GitHub.
[10:27:17] <agcolom> I mean you can obviously ping us all for help and/or testing
[10:27:32] <AurelioDeRosa_> Sure :)
[10:27:43] <agcolom> gnarf: Does Aurelio have an account on browserstack?
[10:27:58] <agcolom> could we get him one if he doesn't already have?
[10:28:08] <agcolom> it might be good for testing purposes...
[10:28:15] <agcolom> and arthurvr also I guess
[10:28:35] <arthurvr> I have one (not a jQuery one just a personal account)
[10:29:33] <agcolom> Is scott_gonzalez around
[10:29:34] <agcolom> ?
[10:30:45] <agcolom> ok, maybe not :-) I'll check with scott_gonzalez and see whether this is something we can arrange
[10:31:13] <AurelioDeRosa_> Sounds good
[10:32:13] <agcolom> ok, anything else we need to discuss?
[10:32:20] <AurelioDeRosa_> I have a couple of FYI
[10:32:24] <agcolom> sure
[10:32:46] <AurelioDeRosa_> 1. As some of you might know, I work as the editor of the JS channel at SitePoint
[10:33:23] <agcolom> nice!
[10:33:31] <AurelioDeRosa_> On Monday I sent the newsletter and I included a message to invite people to vote for us
[10:33:41] <agcolom> thank you!!!!
[10:33:44] <arthurvr> woohoo! thanks
[10:33:48] <AurelioDeRosa_> for the Net awards
[10:33:55] <AurelioDeRosa_> http://sitepointdotcom.createsend.com/t/ViewEmailArchive/y/359B0FE9905C5532/C67FD2F38AC4859C/
[10:33:58] <AurelioDeRosa_> Here you can find the issue
[10:34:05] <AurelioDeRosa_> In case you're interested :)
[10:34:25] <AurelioDeRosa_> This is the most important part:
[10:34:26] <AurelioDeRosa_> Oh...I almost forgot an important note. In case you're a heavy jQuery user, you love jQuery, the library has saved you from dealing with a lot of browsers inconsistencies, or you just think the work of the jQuery team needs to be recognized, please vote the jQuery team as the Team of the year for the Net awards. The whole team, including me, will appreciate your vote!
[10:34:57] <agcolom> Fab! That's great!
[10:35:09] <arthurvr> super-awesome!
[10:35:09] <agcolom> fingers crossed!
[10:35:15] <AurelioDeRosa_> 2. Because I'm now an official member, I've been asked to have an interview that will be published on SitePoint. I'll take the chance to invite more people to vote for us.
[10:35:30] <agcolom> woohoo!!!!
[10:35:35] <AurelioDeRosa_> I'll let you all know when it'll be published
[10:35:37] <agcolom> Congratulations!
[10:36:05] <arthurvr> brilliant
[10:36:07] <AurelioDeRosa_> Well, it was pretty easy being an editor :)
[10:36:13] <AurelioDeRosa_> But thank you anyway
[10:36:41] <AurelioDeRosa_> 3. I don't think the tweet about people helping us has been published yet, but at this point I don't think it's worth.
[10:36:49] <AurelioDeRosa_> It's been a while since the post was published
[10:37:51] <AurelioDeRosa_> And...that's it from me :)
[10:37:57] <agcolom> perfect!
[10:38:02] <AurelioDeRosa_> No blockers
[10:38:07] <agcolom> Sounds great about the interview!
[10:38:27] <AurelioDeRosa_> [Scrum mode off]
[10:38:29] <agcolom> I've sent the link to our marketing director
[10:38:50] <arthurvr> super-duper!
[10:39:33] <arthurvr> oh I had one other thing
[10:39:36] <arthurvr> gnarf you still around?
[10:39:43] <gnarf> arthurvr: kinda
[10:40:14] <arthurvr> if we’re planning to remove/move pages what’s the best way to setup redirects?
[10:40:47] <arthurvr> I guess those kind of settings live in the infrastructure repo so we can’t do it at the moment right?
[10:41:23] <arthurvr> we have this ticket but I don’t think that will get done quick? https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/61
[10:41:26] <arthurvr> gnarf: ^
[10:42:57] <agcolom> Just one item also while we wait, lady3bean has started looking at the learn site which I'm very very pleased about
[10:43:23] <arthurvr> oh that is awesome!
[10:43:27] <arthurvr> how’s it going lady3bean?
[10:43:32] <gnarf> arthurvr: coordinate landing/pushing to live with me, and I'll add redirects at the same time
[10:43:59] <gnarf> arthurvr: we should bump #61 - I could see if I can find someone who can do it
[10:44:22] <agcolom> so big thanks to gnarf also for helping with that :-)
[10:44:28] <arthurvr> perfect. Thanks gnarf!
[10:46:47] <arthurvr> that’s it then I guess. Sorry I wasn’t able to finish that much last week :/ Been crazy busy at other open source and wanted some important things to land
[10:48:53] <arthurvr> anyways I think I gotta leave
[10:49:06] <agcolom> ok, great, thanks everyone!
[10:49:32] <AurelioDeRosa_> Bye bye
[10:49:36] <AurelioDeRosa_> see you next time
[10:50:41] <lady3bean> hey! It's going pretty good. I've gotten a little bogged down though in trying to make the code examples more realistic/useful while also staying simple, and making sure they keep to the rest of the guide. I've been seeing a lot of anonymous functions in click handlers, (which are also written as .click() instead of .on("click", ) and don't know to what extent that stuff should be swapped out.
[10:51:35] <agcolom> Hey lady3bean! Great to have you here!
[10:51:39] <arthurvr> hey hey
[10:52:01] <agcolom> Maybe htat's something arthurvr ans kswedberg could answer?
[10:52:43] <arthurvr> I think a little of inconsistency in there can’t hurt as people should get used to all signatures. Code in the wild uses all kind of methods for that too
[10:53:34] <kswedberg> What arthurvr makes sense. Still, I'd like to see shorthand event methods move to their .on("eventName") counterparts as much as possible.
[10:53:43] <agcolom> I'm +! on making the examples more realistic though and less abstract
[10:53:59] <gnarf> kswedberg: +1 on prefering .on()
[10:54:12] <gnarf> and at least naming the click handler
[10:54:15] <kswedberg> lady3bean: If you have questions about specific examples, feel free to ping any of us.
[10:54:18] <arthurvr> yes, totally! Though we should still teach people about .click() and other things as they’re used all over in the whild
[10:54:24] <lady3bean> cool cool, will do
[10:54:29] <arthurvr> s/whild/wild :p
[10:54:34] <lady3bean> THE WHILD!
[10:54:39] <arthurvr> lol :p
[10:55:39] <agcolom> lady3bean: just for the meeting notes, I add the attendance list... what first name do you use (If that's ok with you)
[10:56:01] <lady3bean> I go by Hawley, though that's not my first name :-)
[10:56:21] <lady3bean> it's pronounced like the normal spelling "Holly"
[10:56:39] <agcolom> yes, that's what I thought your name was ;-)
[11:00:24] <agcolom> ok, so I think we're done for today
[11:00:28] <arthurvr> yea
[11:00:32] <agcolom> Thanks a lot everyone
[11:00:37] <kswedberg> bye all
