[05:22:04] <gibson042> .
[06:06:07] <MacroMan> Does anyone know if there are plans to implement timers into the jQuery core?
[06:06:49] <MacroMan> I find myself making extensive use of setTimer and clearTimer and keep thinking it would be much nicer to have this available in jQuery
[06:06:55] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs
[06:06:56] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[06:07:21] <ajpiano> there's also a bunch of jquery "timer' plugins for instance
[06:07:28] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman dotimeout @ MacroMan
[06:07:29] <bot-t> MacroMan, Ben Alman ª jQuery doTimeout: Like setTimeout, but better - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[06:07:37] <ajpiano> MacroMan: in short, no.
[06:08:07] <MacroMan> OK. thanks. I'll check out that doTimeout though
[07:20:25] <mikesherov> .
[07:20:36] <mikesherov> gibson042: you here?
[07:20:54] <gibson042> yep
[07:21:37] <mikesherov> you did the undefined setters are now chainable thing, right?
[07:22:01] <mikesherov> this bug is starting to rear it's head: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11527
[07:23:23] <gibson042> looking it over now...
[07:24:44] <gibson042> are you able to reproduce it anywhere?
[07:30:22] <mikesherov> I can not repro it
[07:30:44] <mikesherov> and I have a windows XP machine that runs FF11
[07:31:37] <gibson042> same here
[07:32:52] <gibson042> and I can't see anything in our code that would return anything other than a scalar on a single-argument call to fn.attr
[07:42:28] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm not exactly sure either
[07:42:36] <mikesherov> maybe it's in the minified version???
[07:45:01] <Krinkle> .
[07:46:06] <Krinkle> gnarf: LOL! (@"jQuery protip: Object.prototype.nodeType = 1; <-- destroy everything!")
[07:48:49] <gibson042> mikesherov: I don't see anything off in the minified code either
[07:49:08] <mikesherov> I mean attempting to use the minified code to repro it
[07:49:31] <mikesherov> I mean, we've gotten like 5 different reports a bout it
[07:49:39] <mikesherov> at first I thought it was just BS
[07:49:40] <gibson042> from different sources?
[07:49:44] <mikesherov> yes
[07:49:47] <mikesherov> different sources
[07:50:15] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11527
[07:50:17] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11529
[07:50:30] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11516
[07:50:56] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11518
[07:51:18] <mikesherov> so yeah, unless it's one guy trolling us from multiple accounts, different sources
[07:57:29] <gibson042> I just tried with 1.7.2 minified on nix Chromium/Fx and WinXP IE8/FF11 and still can't repro
[08:04:58] <rwaldron> mikesherov wow
[08:05:02] <rwaldron> nice catch on that
[08:05:16] <mikesherov> rwaldron: ?
[08:06:13] <rwaldron> making the possible connection between the bugs and "undefined setters are now chainable thing"
[08:07:08] <mikesherov> It's the only thing I can think of.
[08:07:17] <mikesherov> Now I just need to repro the f'ing thing!
[08:07:22] <rwaldron> and I'm saying...
[08:07:26] <rwaldron> NICE
[08:07:27] <rwaldron> WORK
[08:07:31] <rwaldron> DUDE
[08:07:32] <rwaldron> ;)
[08:07:34] <mikesherov> Haha, yeah! Thanks!
[08:07:46] <rwaldron> the rest of us... baffled.
[08:08:25] <mikesherov> I'm a bug smasher at heart, I feel it's my duty to look at it from every angle
[08:08:31] <rwaldron> +1
[08:08:52] <mikesherov> So, speaking of which, still no one can repro this f'ing thing?
[08:08:55] <rwaldron> I havent had any time and TBH, i thought it was bogis
[08:08:57] <rwaldron> bogus
[08:09:10] <rwaldron> right... which is why i thought it was bogus
[08:09:49] <mikesherov> I was suggesting maybe compatibility view might have something to do with it, but that's just grasping at straws and doesn't explain the supposed FF11 repro
[08:09:50] <rwaldron> I;m running this: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/VZLsH/4/show/light/ in browsers
[08:10:35] <mikesherov> right... maybe it's the HTML5 doctype? I dunno... I'm just improving here
[08:11:02] <mikesherov> That reporters seem to suggest it just happens without much problems
[08:13:53] <rwaldron> mikesherov just tried compat mode in IE8, no luck
[08:14:19] <mikesherov> hmm
[08:14:33] <mikesherov> OK, I'm going to see if I can dig something up
[10:53:02] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from jqueryui: Its been seven months since 1.9m6. Time for 1.9m7! http://t.co/YxqtH8qf Accordion redesign is done, tons of other improvements. ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/Hfi24u
[11:17:33] <Krinkle> I wish there was a way in Chrome Debugger's step-by-stepper to make it skip anything in a certain namespace
[11:17:36] <Krinkle> e.g. jQuery.*
[11:18:08] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Any ideas? It would make debugging of an app that "uses" jQuery a lot easier, to avoid 20 steps at random when something goes into jQuery
[11:19:24] <ajpiano> that sounds complicated
[11:19:46] <Krinkle> I didn't think it was simple since what function belongs to what is very nasty in javascript
[11:20:06] <Krinkle> although I was impressed by the call stack in Chrome (that figures out a nice name for each function)
[11:21:19] <Krinkle> e.g. "jQuery.Callbacks.self.add"
[11:21:32] <Krinkle> Chrome just makes that up afaik, but does a pretty good job at it
[11:22:00] <ajpiano> yea, i love that
[11:22:15] <ajpiano> but it's relatively easy to just like, mentally filter it out of the call stack
[11:22:34] <Krinkle> yeah, but when I'm in the paused mode, I only see what's past and what's next
[11:22:35] <ajpiano> adding it as a UI feature probably would involve so much effort and have a relatively low marginal return
[11:23:14] <Krinkle> I usually click very fast when I get into jQuery (unless I"m debugging jQuery itself), but hate myself when I click one too far
[11:23:17] <Krinkle> there is no back button
[11:23:23] <Krinkle> now *that* would be awesome
[11:23:26] <Krinkle> a back button
[11:23:32] <Krinkle> reverse javascript execution :P
[11:23:32] <gnarf> click step out instead
[11:23:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah, that does help in most cases, you're right
[11:24:08] <gnarf> although it might be interesting to set a whole .js file to "don't stop on stepping"
[11:24:34] <Krinkle> ah right, it knows the source file. no need to figure out by name space
[11:24:58] <ajpiano> i would be so much more interested in actually *getting* a call stack when you use the DOM/XHR breakpoints
[11:25:02] <ajpiano> that would be *incredible* for debugging
[11:25:10] <gnarf> so like when you hit a elem.attr( function() { }); you don't have to put a breakpoint inside the function before hitting it
[11:38:42] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ping
[11:57:27] <paul_irish> Krinkle: yehuda filed a ticket along those lines.. esc.
[11:57:47] <Krinkle> thx paul_irish

[11:58:18] <paul_irish> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80384
[11:58:27] <paul_irish> if you would like that, any more detail you can add would be awesome
[12:00:25] <paul_irish> also should have 1.7.2 on the CDN within a few hours
[12:00:26] <paul_irish> i hope
[12:00:38] <paul_irish> Krinkle-away:  ^ ^
[12:00:44] <paul_irish> ajpiano: ^
[12:48:49] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you here?
[12:48:55] <mikesherov> I think I know what's happening...
[12:48:58] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/7u7cN/2/
[12:49:07] <mikesherov> run that ^^^ in 1.6.4 and 1.7.2
[12:49:58] <gibson042> that's it!!!
[12:50:21] <mikesherov> plugins
[12:50:44] <mikesherov> assuming that undefined will just run the getter and NOT the setter
[12:51:02] <gibson042> and assuming that extra arguments will never be added
[12:52:12] <gibson042> great catch
[12:53:28] <rwaldron> mikesherov looking
[12:53:47] <rwaldron> mikesherov ^5
[12:53:56] <rwaldron> can you make this a core test?
[12:54:15] <mikesherov> I just sent out a email to the core grooup
[12:54:27] <mikesherov> we explicitly changed this behavior
[12:54:51] <mikesherov> passing undefined as a second parameter explicitly calls the setter as a no-op instead of the getter
[12:54:53] <rwaldron> mikesherov maybe
[12:55:01] <mikesherov> this is a big assumption plugin authors are making
[12:55:02] <gibson042> .apply(this, arguments) was and is the safe way to augment methods
[12:55:09] <rwaldron> but not with unanimous agreement
[12:55:12] <rwaldron> i hate that shit
[12:55:18] <mikesherov> Yes, it is
[12:55:19] <mikesherov> rwaldron: i agree
[12:55:26] <mikesherov> I'm not saying it should stay this way
[12:55:40] <rwaldron> i've been opposed to all feature requests for this since forever
[12:55:56] <mikesherov> I'm just saying I can't write a unit test exposing a known behavior change
[12:56:09] <rwaldron> so
[12:56:16] <rwaldron> this unit test should've existed before
[12:56:23] <mikesherov> I think we should revert this change and release 1.7.3 immediately
[12:56:30] <mikesherov> Yes, I can make it exist
[12:56:41] <rwaldron> it supports an expected behaviour retroactively
[12:56:47] <mikesherov> Sure
[12:56:50] <mikesherov> I'll do it
[12:56:53] <rwaldron> thank you
[12:56:56] <rwaldron> great work
[12:56:59] <rwaldron> realy, really awesome
[12:57:03] <mikesherov> No problem
[12:57:19] <mikesherov> I'll write the test for it, but I don't think we should wait for the unit tests before pushing out a 1.7.3
[12:57:25] <mikesherov> I think it's that big of a problem
[12:58:40] <mikesherov> I actually have a bunch of shit I gotta do today, so I'll write the unit tests tonight, but I have to admit that reverting this thing is way over my head
[12:58:49] <rwaldron> I need a DaveMethvin bat phone
[12:58:50] <rwaldron> one sec
[12:59:27] <gibson042> I can't do it right now, but I can tell you how
[12:59:57] <gibson042> jQuery.access has a parameter "chainable" that controls behavior for undefined values
[13:00:24] <gibson042> right now everything assigns to it (arguments.length > 1)
[13:00:38] <gibson042> well, almost everything
[13:01:10] <gibson042> if you make it explicitly false, that call will revert to old behavior
[13:01:24] <mikesherov> Sure, but what other assumptions did we change
[13:01:42] <mikesherov> I want to revert all the behavior changes so we can have a safe release
[13:01:56] <ajpiano> hum
[13:01:58] <ajpiano> what a bummer
[13:02:17] <mikesherov> It's a bit over my head, do you think we should just revert the entire commit and re-evaluate?
[13:02:21] <gibson042> before the change, there was a mix of how undefined was treated
[13:02:28] <ajpiano> if it's now a "breaking change" it means we should have not done it
[13:02:31] <ajpiano> until 1.8
[13:02:32] <rwaldron> ajpiano do you have dave's cell?
[13:02:34] <ajpiano> so reverting makes sense
[13:02:35] <ajpiano> but it sucks
[13:02:41] <mikesherov> sure, it sucks
[13:02:48] <rwaldron> we just called richard but he's at the airport
[13:02:56] <mikesherov> woah
[13:03:01] <mikesherov> batphone indeed
[13:03:23] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i don't, trying to get it
[13:03:43] <mikesherov> Guys, unfortunately, I really gotta run. I'll be on around 9:30 or so to write up some tests.
[13:04:06] <rwaldron> mikesherov no worries
[13:04:16] <rwaldron> you've done all kinds of awesome things
[13:04:41] <mikesherov> haha, thanks. Coming from you that is a major compliment.
[13:04:49] <mikesherov> Later!
[13:05:39] <gnarf> anyone else have the davemethvin batphone
[13:05:40] <gnarf> ?
[13:06:12] * gnarf ponders an "emergency contact" list for team members
[13:06:22] <ajpiano> gnarf: turns out we have one
[13:06:42] <ajpiano> i gave dave's # to rick just in pm :) gnarf
[13:06:57] <gnarf> ajpiano: nice - want my # for it, or am I already there?
[13:07:18] <ajpiano> you are actually already there
[13:07:32] <gnarf> yeah i remember seeing that at the devdays last jqcon
[13:07:36] <gnarf> and adding myself
[13:08:15] <gnarf> so like wtf argument order tweaking
[13:08:29] <rwaldron> I'm gonna tackle a patch
[13:08:35] <gnarf> what benefit was "undefined is a noop setter"
[13:08:44] <rwaldron> none
[13:08:49] * rwaldron grumbles
[13:09:18] <gnarf> and why's it landing in point versions? :)
[13:09:49] <ajpiano> ppl wanted to be able to set with a value they weren't sure is undefined
[13:09:49] <gnarf> always hate when we release a version we need to eat as soon as it is released...
[13:10:01] <ajpiano> but yeah
[13:10:02] <ajpiano> it sucks
[13:10:10] <ajpiano> cause now we're gonna release 1.7.3 and then what, put this back in in 1.8
[13:10:12] <gnarf> ajpiano: they can do that anyway, it just might break the chain
[13:10:17] <ajpiano> or do we just forget it altogether and say
[13:10:23] <gibson042> affected methods: .attr/.prop/.css/.data/.width/.height/.text/.html/.scrollLeft/.scrollTop
[13:10:29] <ajpiano> gnarf: that's what i meant. set something maybe undefined and keep chaining
[13:11:08] <gibson042> behavior should be reverted just by always setting chainable=false
[13:11:09] <ajpiano> this prob should have landed in 1.8
[13:11:12] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure that UI does something like that duck punch on a few functions, but none of those listed
[13:11:24] <ajpiano> but it's essentially the same as what happened with delegate in 1.4.2
[13:11:38] <ajpiano> cause jzaefferer had a delegate with a diff sig in the validation plugin
[13:11:47] <ajpiano> and obvs, we didn't roll that back
[13:12:41] <ajpiano> i don't know how many plugins are *actually* duckpunching attr
[13:14:48] <gnarf> has anyone outside of mike reported it yet?
[13:15:29] <gnarf> rwaldron: seems mike's fiddle was in response to you somehow - were you guys hunting for a bug?
[13:15:46] <ajpiano> gnarf: yea
[13:15:47] <ajpiano> like
[13:15:53] <ajpiano> there's been a rash of filings
[13:18:03] <rwaldron> This is a massive changeset
[13:18:35] <gibson042> rwaldron: you should be able to fix it by updating every call to jQuery.access so that chainable is faly
[13:18:40] <gibson042> *falsy
[13:18:49] <rwaldron> and leave a bunch of useless code?
[13:19:29] <gibson042> it's not a bunch, it's <50 bytes
[13:19:44] <gibson042> the original changeset *reduced* the library size
[13:19:51] <rwaldron> this is a lot of changes for <50 bytes
[13:19:51] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/6c2a501de40a5f6b3ad382e2d309e5a10fce04d0#diff-6
[13:19:52] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (3m, 3w ago): Fix #5571. Setters should treat `undefined` as a no-op and be chainable.
[13:20:44] <gnarf> i think this is a silly change
[13:21:04] <gnarf> if i did elem.data("shit", undefined)
[13:21:10] <gnarf> i'd hope it would elem.removeData("shit")
[13:21:17] <gibson042> it all centers around .access; and the chainable parameter is only used thrice
[13:21:39] <gnarf> like thats what i would expect if i LITERALY passed undefined
[13:21:47] <gnarf> not some noop
[13:24:15] * gnarf doesn't understand why we'd do a noop on undefined - any explain?
[13:25:42] <gibson042> the original complaint was that ("key", undefined) wasn't chainable
[13:25:46] <ajpiano> for data, or for all getter/setters gnarf ?
[13:25:47] <ajpiano> yea
[13:26:01] <gnarf> ajpiano: data in particular, but any of them kinda makes sense
[13:26:04] <gibson042> no one had a great idea of what "safe" chainable behavior would be, so it no-ops
[13:26:06] <gnarf> .attr("abc", undefined)
[13:26:17] <ajpiano> people would always be like wah wah, i want to do $("foo").attr("bar", someobj.somepropthatmightbeundefined).css("wat", "why")
[13:26:17] <gnarf> === .removeAttr("abc")
[13:26:36] <gibson042> bingo
[13:26:39] <ajpiano> but it breaks when its undefined
[13:26:48] <ajpiano> and people kept filing that over the years
[13:28:25] <gnarf> but like - noone knew what they wanted that undefined to do? cuz if "bar" is set to something
[13:28:29] <gnarf> and i tell it to set to undefined
[13:28:32] <gnarf> i want it to remove it
[13:28:40] <gnarf> noop = unintuitive
[13:29:07] <ajpiano> gnarf: i don't people were ever using undefined as a clear-er
[13:29:14] <ajpiano> they always *thought* they had a value
[13:29:29] <ajpiano> but then it would be like, some unstructured data coming from the server wouldn't have a particular key here or there and it would break
[13:29:39] <ajpiano> was at least, how it was reported to me every time i encountered it
[13:29:47] <gnarf> hrm
[13:29:49] <gnarf> i guess
[13:30:24] <gnarf> either way - i still think removal is the goal of setting something to undefined
[13:30:56] <gnarf> but it doesn't solve this duckpunch issue anyway
[13:31:18] <ajpiano> ohhh
[13:31:26] <ajpiano> yeah i don't know why the no-nop is actually part of the question
[13:31:30] <ajpiano> no-op
[13:31:41] <ajpiano> setting it to undefined and chaining, would be reasonable too
[13:31:51] <ajpiano> but yeah, this is a completley different problem
[13:32:11] <ajpiano> which, if it's only affecting people who are duckpunching the method, there is some precedent for not rolling back
[13:32:13] <ajpiano> is all i'm saying
[13:32:19] <gnarf> issues with the behavior of undefined aside... what do we do about the duckpunch problem... because honestly, its pretty easily fixed
[13:32:27] <ajpiano> but it's also a breaking change in a point release :(
[13:33:05] <gnarf> agree
[13:33:10] <gnarf> its not a bugfix
[13:33:18] <gnarf> its a new enhancement/feature
[13:33:29] <gnarf> which i thought we avoided in points
[13:33:40] <ajpiano> yea exactly
[13:33:44] <ajpiano> that's the argument for rolling it back
[13:33:57] * gnarf turns on the DaveMethvin bat-signal and points it at the sky
[13:34:37] <gibson042> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5571 is identified as an enhancement
[13:36:11] <ajpiano> yep
[13:37:01] <gnarf> gibson042: agreed - point releases should only have bug fixes, not potential breaking changes... I'm just not sure why this landed in 1.7.2 -- but since it has, we need to figure out what we want to do
[13:37:33] <snover> d√©j√† vu
[13:37:37] <ajpiano> yeah i think we just need to wait for dave to pop in and settle it once we have a patch that reverts it
[13:38:25] <ajpiano> i think reverting it is the only like, consistent solution. arg
[13:38:35] <ajpiano> got us there snover!
[13:38:57] <gibson042> I agree
[13:39:07] <gnarf> gibson042: can you get a pull assembled that a) adds a test case for this duck punch issue, b) reverts the behavior -- unless rwaldron is still working on it i think it makes sense to have gibson042 tweak his own landed pull
[13:39:34] <gnarf> i also don't want to lose the massive size reduction you landed in that patch either :)
[13:39:37] <snover> I thought that I‚Äôd manage to settle that once and for at with 1.4.4 :)
[13:40:00] <gibson042> I'm not at a computer where I can do it right now...
[13:40:09] <gnarf> fair nuff
[13:40:23] <snover> and by :) I mean ‚Äú:( I hate that this keeps happening‚Äù
[13:40:30] <gibson042> but the way to revert it without losing those savings is via the chainable parameter
[13:40:32] <ajpiano> snover: i think it's settled once and for all, just this one slipped through the cracks and now we are trying to stick to it
[13:40:41] <ajpiano> ohhhh
[13:40:44] <gibson042> make it explicitly false for every call except in fn.css
[13:40:55] <gnarf> if dave shows up - text me or something so i can join the debate
[13:41:13] <rwaldron> gnarf I'm almost done
[13:41:17] <rwaldron> see above please
[14:30:23] <jzaefferer> hey rwaldron, interested in building a validator for jQuery's style guide? The idea is to use jsbeautify ( https://github.com/einars/js-beautify/blob/master/beautify.js ), customize it to format the code as intended, then to validate, format the file to a tmp dir and diff against the input; then integrate that with grunt
[14:32:37] <rwaldron> I just spoke to Dave
[14:32:45] <rwaldron> gnarf ^^
[14:32:56] <gnarf> yeah?
