[03:04:44] <matjas> iz these a bugâ€½ textarea/@maxlength weirdness in IE http://jsfiddle.net/mathias/Vc9ap/
[03:05:47] <matjas> IE9: undefined,undefined,undefined
[03:06:02] <matjas> IE8: undefined,undefined,42
[03:06:40] <matjas> it should say `42,42,undefined`
[03:07:09] <matjas> IE10 gets it right
[03:09:40] <matjas> textareaElement.maxlength and textareaElement.maxLength both fail in IE9â€¦ seems you have to use getAttribute? wtf
[03:33:54] <matjas> addyosmani: ping ^
[03:34:51] <addyosmani> heya matjas
[03:35:07] <matjas> seems to me we need something more complicated than propFix :(
[03:35:13] <addyosmani> :(
[03:35:45] <matjas> iâ€™m using el.maxLength || el.maxlength || el.getAttribute('maxlength') now
[03:35:53] <matjas> i guess jQuery should do something similar
[03:36:56] <addyosmani> I think this calls for a ticket/pull request to be submitted :)
[03:37:03] <addyosmani> does suck that it isn't already taken care of though
[03:37:06] <matjas> on it
[03:37:17] <matjas> just wanted to discuss it here first, thought i was missing something obvious :(
[03:37:20] <matjas> alas!
[03:37:26] <addyosmani> alas indeed!
[03:37:42] <addyosmani> hope internet exploder doesn't cause you too many more woes this morning.

[06:10:05] <timmywil> .
[06:34:26] <timmywil> JohnResig: so we want tickets to start with a 'none' milestone?
[06:34:40] <timmywil> might make 1.next tickets go to the background
[06:37:03] <timmywil> For instance, none gets confirmed, gets changed to 1.next, then when we triage we go through all of the none tickets first and possibly neglect 1.next.
[06:44:16] <timmywil> I'd prefer just to have them all together.  We can filter out pending or others we don't want to see.  Otherwise, 1.next should be always be triaged.
[06:44:30] <timmywil> -otherwise
[07:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: for UI we use 1.next and 1.later where 1.next actually means it's been triaged into the release that will be 2 versions from now (since 1.9 is the next version)
[07:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> and we use pending to tell us if the ticket has been reviewed for quality/validity
[07:29:57] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: thanks, good to know
[07:33:02] <JohnResig> timmywil: the way we're doing it is that everything that's in 1.next is confirmed and triaged
[07:33:16] <JohnResig> stuff with a status of 'none' is not confirmed
[07:34:00] <JohnResig> this gives us a very clear list of things that we need to tackle - everything that's in 1.next is confirmed and needs to be fixed
[07:34:30] <timmywil> JohnResig: I think that was the case before as well, if the ticket was open
[07:35:11] <JohnResig> timmywil: before - all tickets went to 1.next, there was no way to differentiate beteween something we should be actively working to fix in an upcoming release vs not
[07:35:55] <timmywil> JohnResig: ok, I guess I thought open/closed was good enough for that
[07:36:21] <JohnResig> ah, no - since we have an intermediary state of people submitting random tickets that haven't been confirmed yet
[07:36:46] <timmywil> for argument's sake, those are still new tho
[07:37:11] <timmywil> not opened yet
[07:37:19] <JohnResig> possibly - but there is a gap between "this has a test case" and "this is actually something that the team has determined that we want to fix"
[07:37:47] <JohnResig> during the triage meeting we closed a bunch of confirmed bugs that we determined that we couldn't fix or didn't want to fix
[07:38:17] <timmywil> ok, that makes sense. so there's been more review for 1.next tickets
[07:38:26] <JohnResig> yep, exactly
[07:38:58] <timmywil> JohnResig: thanks for clearing that up
[07:39:37] <JohnResig> yep, np!
[07:43:54] <kswedberg> hey all. I got an api documentation report from someone that I'm not sure how to handle. hoping someone here can help.
[07:44:24] <kswedberg> Sent from: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:44:25] <kswedberg> Whatever you think the proper behavior of the function is, the documentation should at least note that serialize() by itself is NOT an appropriate mechanism to prepare data for a POST submission. Most importantly, checkbox and radio controls with names that include square brackets WILL be messed up. Â And don't tell me that square brackets are not permitted in form control names: a) not true-http://dev.w3.org/html5/
[07:47:18] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, timmywil, JohnResig, Bueller â€¦  thoughts? ^^
[07:48:16] <DaveMethvin> I thought it worked, what exactly is broken?
[07:48:56] <timmywil> worksforme
[07:49:00] <DaveMethvin> is this affected by the confounded jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional mess?
[07:49:12] <kswedberg> dunno. that's why I'm a little confused. thought there might be something I didn't know about. do the brackets get serialized oddly?
[07:49:19] <kswedberg> I mean urlencoded?
[07:50:09] <DaveMethvin> i mean i understand that PHP hosed it all up by expecting brackets, but i thought we did support its stupidity to the best of our ability
[07:50:25] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: not sure, but it sounds like he's speaking from the "non-traditional" side of things â€” because I think that change was supposed to support PHP stuff
[07:50:28] <DaveMethvin> we don't have a bug reported against this
[07:50:53] <ajpiano> it doesn't seem like he's saying what the problem is
[07:50:55] <ajpiano> he's just like
[07:50:59] <ajpiano> IT'S NOT DOING WHAT I EXPECT
[07:51:04] <timmywil> I think it needs a ticket & test case :)
[07:51:04] <ajpiano> what i expect === ??
[07:51:08] <DaveMethvin> Y U NO SERIALIZE
[07:51:32] <kswedberg> yeah, ok. I'll just tell him to be more specific and file a bug with test case if he thinks there is a bug.
[07:52:28] <ajpiano> haha
[07:52:56] <ajpiano> ++
[07:56:27] <kswedberg> my reply: "I'm not aware of problems with PHP and brackets. In fact, jQuery 1.4 changed jQuery.param (which is what .serialize() uses) to account for this type of thing with PHP, Ruby, etc. (cf. http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/).Â If you think there is a bug with .serialize(), though, please be specific about what the bug is (you can't just say "square brackets WILL be messed up) and provide a test case on http:/
[07:56:46] <kswedberg> thx for the input, DaveMethvin, timmywil, ajpiano!
[07:57:43] <timmywil> cool np
[08:10:41] <timmywil> docs#9835 that's a whole bunch of stuff we prolly aren't gonna do
[08:10:43] <bot-t> [#9835] anchor link fails when linking to a page that includes jquery 1.6 + (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9835
[08:11:17] <timmywil> maybe the support changes had something to do with it tho
[11:37:06] <rwaldron> has anyone spoken to jaubourg in recent times?
[11:59:11] <clarkbox> anyone know if there is a way to copy/move a branch in git to another non-git directory?
[11:59:19] <clarkbox> i tried  GIT_WORK_TREE but that did not seem to work
[11:59:51] <ajpiano> what if you just copy the entire directory somewhere else while the branch you want is checked out, and then delete the .git directory from it
[12:00:07] <clarkbox> i want to avoid doing checkout branchx, and then a cp/rsync
[12:00:19] <clarkbox> but if thats the only way....
[12:00:46] <ajpiano> you might want to check in with someone with a bit more expertise in these dark arts than i
[12:01:07] <clarkbox> maybe more efficient to do a clone -b branchX
[12:01:13] <clarkbox> to a new dir
[12:01:51] <ajpiano> might take longer though
[12:02:02] <clarkbox> ill just let that Q marinate in everyones scroll buffer
[12:02:12] <ajpiano> mmmmmm
[12:02:15] <Justin_o> clarkbox: if you have the code up in github, then you can just download the zip/tar of the branch
[12:02:55] <clarkbox> that would pull EVERYTHING each time. using git cmds would only pull delta
[12:02:59] <clarkbox> im doing this ever 5 min
[12:03:02] <clarkbox> via cron
[12:05:01] <Justin_o> clarkbox: oh, just out of curiosity, why did you need to strip out the .git directory.. or at least not have it be a git aware directory anymore?
[12:05:13] <clarkbox> i think the best thing will be to keep a clone/directory for every branch
[12:05:26] <clarkbox> dont need to strip that out
[12:06:38] <clarkbox> ...but then ill have repo-size*branches on my disk
[12:08:26] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Hey, don't know if you remember me from last night, where I asked to reopen a ticket?
[12:09:07] <ajpiano> i remember you from like talking to you on irc loooooooooong times ago
[12:09:11] <ajpiano> :)
[12:09:20] <Justin_o> clarkbox: hmm.. maybe something like  this, but it might be too much overhead http://stackoverflow.com/questions/160608/how-to-do-a-git-export-like-svn-export
[12:10:49] <Bubbi> Heh :-) You said that I could post a testcase for the VML error, that I had made a patch for.. I don't have much experience in that, so I was just wondering if you could take a look at it - maybe it is too much or maybe it's not enough :-) http://jsfiddle.net/7p3Yr/23/
[12:11:33] <rwaldron> Bubbi, please see: http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[12:11:42] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i directed him there yesterday
[12:11:44] <rwaldron> specifically: http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[12:11:51] <rwaldron> ajpiano oh, sorry
[12:11:51] <ajpiano> and then i sent him to your post about jquery bug fixing guide
[12:12:05] <rwaldron> didnt mean to duplicate information
[12:12:07] <ajpiano> and said that if he put stuff together that actually worked, we'd look at it perhaps :)
[12:12:08] <ajpiano> no problemo
[12:12:17] * rwaldron will now STFU
[12:12:37] <Bubbi> rwaldron: The thing is that I have made a patch for it, but I would just like to know if the testcase is good enough, as I'm new to it :-)
[12:13:02] <Bubbi> It's a simple one-liner, that have been used earlier in jQuery, but just needs to be placed a few more places..
[12:14:34] <clarkbox> thanks for the link Justin_o
[12:15:17] <Bubbi> rwaldron: By the way, why isn't that guide for windows ppl ;-)
[12:16:25] <ajpiano> Bubbi: yeah, seems like a good testccase ... i got the "Failed" error
[12:19:02] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Great :-) Now I just need to figure out how to get the patched version up.. hmm.. Are there any services, that you developers use, so it won't be on a domain, that might go offline in a year or two..?
[12:19:25] <ajpiano> you  have to file a pull request on github
[12:20:22] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Alright.. I'll see if I can find out how to do that..
[12:20:32] <ajpiano> ok, that is how we accept patches
[12:20:39] <ajpiano> Bubbi: start by forking jQuery :)
[12:20:43] <ajpiano> and then follow the instructions in that guide
[12:20:49] <Bubbi> This is all new to me ;-)
[12:20:55] <ajpiano> you'll have to setup git on windows first, but there are plenty of guides out there on how to do it :)
[12:21:06] <ajpiano> ?g msysgit @ Bubbi
[12:21:07] <bot-t> Bubbi, msysgit - Git for Windows - Google Project Hosting - http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
[12:21:31] <Bubbi> Yeah, I have installed that.. Do I need node.js?
[12:21:38] <ajpiano> http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/
[12:22:24] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:22:27] <Bubbi> I have it all set up and ready to use.. Got it to work last night, but just didn't get any further :-)
[12:22:48] <ajpiano> once you have git installed, make your own fork of jquery and commit your changes on a branch :)
[12:23:03] <ajpiano> there'll probably be some learning pains though ;)
[12:38:33] <Bubbi> ajpiano: a quick question, that I couldn't find an answer to on the github website.. When using the msysgit to fetch an "upstream" of jquery (don't know if that is just a name that the github guide suggested), how long will it generally take? it doesn't have a "counter" of any kind, and it looks like it is still working, but without telling on what :-)
[12:38:47] <ajpiano> clone?
[12:38:52] <ajpiano> shouldn't take *that* long
[12:42:05] <Bubbi> I have already made a clone of jQuery. github suggests that besides your own fork that is an "origin" remote, it is also a good thing to make an upstream remote, that points to the original, that I have forked - in this case jquery. But when I did as is explained in the guide, it just.. well doesn't seem to do anything..
[12:42:43] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:42:46] <ajpiano> it just creates the remote
[12:42:49] <ajpiano> so if you did
[12:43:07] <Bubbi> I wrote this: $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
[12:43:13] <Bubbi> $ git fetch upstream
[12:43:14] <ajpiano> right
[12:43:23] <ajpiano> yeah there's probably nothing to fetch
[12:43:26] <ajpiano> because you just forked
[12:43:34] <ajpiano> and there haven't been any commits to the upstream jquery in the last 15 minutse :)
[12:43:41] <Bubbi> oh heh..
[12:43:54] <Bubbi> Dammit - I thought you were working on it right now ;-)
[12:44:00] <ajpiano> hehe
[12:44:46] <Bubbi> Where the hell does it place the files on my computer.. :S I don't seem to be able to find them..
[12:45:36] <ajpiano> whereever you cloned to, it created a new directory
[12:46:58] <clarkbox> in case anyone is wondering... you can move a branch into seperate dir with ....
[12:47:03] <clarkbox> git checkout-index -f -a --prefix=dest
[12:47:14] <Bubbi> well.. it didn't really ask where to clone to.. just $ git clone git@github.com:[username]/jquery.git
[12:47:58] <kborchers> Bubbi: windows right?
[12:47:59] <ajpiano> right
[12:48:04] <ajpiano> what directory were you in when that happened
[12:48:07] <Bubbi> kborchers: yep
[12:48:15] <kborchers> what version
[12:48:24] <Bubbi> win7
[12:48:50] <kborchers> check c:\Users\your_username
[12:49:30] <Bubbi> fantastic.. thanks kborchers
[12:57:54] <Bubbi> uhm.. quick question.. what if I want to move the folder in my c:\users\ folder to another place. was that the "git checkout-index -f -a --prefix=dest" that clarkbox wrote earlier?
[12:59:15] <ajpiano> no, that was unrelated
[12:59:23] <ajpiano> just take the folder and move it somewhere else
[13:02:48] <Bubbi> okay thanks :-)
[13:11:31] <Bubbi> Dear god..! Okay, small question again.. I have now commited (or so I think) an updated file (events.js) to my fork. How do I see that this works on Github..?
[13:11:50] <ajpiano> did you commit it on master?
[13:12:06] <Bubbi> yep
[13:12:09] <ajpiano> :/
[13:12:32] <Bubbi> [head to table] .. I shouldn't have done that, i presume..
[13:12:36] <ajpiano> yea
[13:12:38] <ajpiano> you shouldn't have
[13:12:53] <ajpiano> it's fixable but not fun to in your first 30 minutes of git use
[13:13:06] <Bubbi> oh boy..
[13:13:25] <ajpiano> you just don't want to be committing to master on a project where you need to keep in sync with an upstream master
[13:13:45] <Bubbi> okay, I should have made some sort of branch?
[13:13:48] <ajpiano> yep
[13:13:54] <ajpiano> as described in the bug fixing guide :)
[13:14:10] <Bubbi> github:help here I come.. :-)
[13:14:15] <ajpiano> since you're not too far down the rabbit hole yet
[13:14:21] <ajpiano> i would just say you should clone the repo again
[13:14:30] <ajpiano> set up the other remotes
[13:14:34] <ajpiano> and this time, commit on a branch
[13:14:48] <ajpiano> this way you don't have to go typing in a magical bunch of git commands you don't understand
[13:15:21] <Bubbi> Would I need to do anything other than just delete the folder on my computer..? There isn't anything in any registry keys..?
[13:15:56] <ajpiano> nothing else.. just baleete away
[13:17:24] <Bubbi> cool.. I'll baleete it ;-)
[13:32:54] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Yay - i've now pushed it to a branch..
[13:32:59] <Bubbi> Then what :D
[13:33:11] <Bubbi> i know... read the guide.. ;-)
[13:39:05] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Okay, I think I have done it correctly.. made a pull request and all..
[13:40:22] <Bubbi> This shit is not for normal ppl :-)
[13:41:55] <ajpiano> lol
[13:42:00] <Bubbi> Well.. I'm off.. Gotta get home from work now..  The cleaning lady is looking weird at me.. it's only 22:40 :D
[13:42:01] <ajpiano> you'll get used to it
[13:42:05] <ajpiano> heh
[13:42:47] <Bubbi> Hope that I did it correctly and that it will be included - or altered to a better state.. After all I just copied some existing code in jquery..
[13:43:17] <ajpiano> yeah it might need some TLC
[13:43:40] <Bubbi> TLC?
[13:44:46] <Bubbi> Ah.. tender love and care.. i presume.. I was starting to think that you wanted some band to look at it :D
[13:45:38] <Bubbi> And now i'm talking jibberish.. Good night and good morning to those of you who just woke up..
[13:45:42] <Bubbi> exit
[13:45:45] <Bubbi> .. dammit..
[15:37:30] <jaubourg> hello
[15:40:49] <jaubourg> rwaldron: you forked ajaxHooks?
[15:42:09] <rwaldron> rgranti did
[15:42:13] <rwaldron> effff
[15:42:16] <rwaldron> yes
[15:42:18] <rwaldron> i did
[15:42:25] <rwaldron> thought i was going to need something
[15:42:27] <rwaldron> but didnt
[15:42:30] <rwaldron> still love you
[15:42:35] <rwaldron> so how about that
[15:42:49] <jaubourg> oh, meh, I was hoping for some pull request action here... but I'll take the lovin'
[15:42:52] <jaubourg> ;)
[15:43:27] <rwaldron> well, if i thinking of anything inspiring, I will certainly contribute :)
[15:44:15] <jaubourg> yeah, I finally get some time to work on it and I'll add some stuff in ;)
[15:45:35] <jaubourg> how's life as a couple btw? :)
[15:48:00] <rwaldron> well... we've been a "couple" for some time now
[15:48:35] <rwaldron> and i basically stayed at her house 345 days between july 1 2010 and july 1 2011
[15:48:48] <rwaldron> (thats when she moved into her place that she just moved out of)
[15:49:01] <rwaldron> but yeah, officially living together is pretty awesome
[15:49:06] <rwaldron> she decorates nicely
[15:49:39] <jaubourg> :)
[15:49:47] <jaubourg> coolness, so happy for you :)
[15:49:50] <rwaldron> she hug one of these over the bed:
[15:49:51] <rwaldron> http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/mattyc1965/mattyc19650811/mattyc1965081100061/3815696-gazelle-skull.jpg
[15:49:53] <rwaldron> hung*
[15:49:56] <rwaldron> thanks dude
[15:50:17] <rwaldron> also, my crappy apartment is really starting to look like a nice place to live
[15:50:23] <rwaldron> i had the maids in yesterday
[15:50:27] <rwaldron> totally worth it
[15:50:34] <jaubourg> man, reminds of when one of my ex redecorated the flat with the most insane giger paintings ever... and I actually liked it ;)
[15:51:07] <jaubourg> yeah, I cleaned up my flat not so long ago... so much more barable now
[15:52:53] <stephenjudkins> anyone have any insights on how one would begin to address http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381?
[15:54:46] <rwaldron> jaubourg ggiger paintings would improve _anything_
[15:54:51] <rwaldron> giger*
[15:55:10] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins thats how requestAnimationFrame works
[15:55:49] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: you're correct, but it's not how jquery animations worked until 1.6, and it's a behavior that I consider broken.
[15:55:59] <rwaldron> thats cool
[15:57:18] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: so you believe this shouldn't be fixed?
[15:57:30] <rwaldron> I can promise you that it won't
[15:57:41] <rwaldron> requestAnimationFrame is a performance win
[15:58:18] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: so, for all eternity, an animation triggered when the browser is minimized will queue up, and only start once the browser is re-opened?
[15:59:20] <rwaldron> yeah. anything else is a perf sink and borderline memory leak
[15:59:36] <rwaldron> I had to re-read your question
[15:59:39] <rwaldron> a few times
[15:59:47] <stephenjudkins> even if simply skipping the animation would, in almost all cases, result in behavior that appears much less broken?
[15:59:53] <rwaldron> i'm not sure i even understand why that would be desirable
[16:00:40] <stephenjudkins> i'll explain: we have a page open that receives events through a comet-like message bus. these events trigger animations
[16:01:05] <stephenjudkins> when a user minimizes her browser window, these animations simply queue up, until the window is un-minimized, and all the animations occur it once
[16:01:34] <stephenjudkins> this behavior seems very broken, and much less correct than how it worked when we used setTimeout
[16:01:43] <rwaldron> there's an easy solution
[16:02:02] <rwaldron> kill the animations if the focus is gone
[16:02:18] <rwaldron> only run them if you can get wndow focus
[16:02:37] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: why not have jquery's animation function do this for us?
[16:02:56] <rwaldron> because your case isnt everyone's case
[16:04:14] <stephenjudkins> it looks like it broke a lot of stuff
[16:04:41] <stephenjudkins> i think most people would prefer correctness--or at least consistency--over performance
[16:10:34] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/KK5mP/
[16:11:10] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: shouldn't this be part of jquery?
[16:11:15] <rwaldron> no
[16:11:25] <stephenjudkins> when I say "animate this, and finish in 2000 ms"
[16:11:48] <stephenjudkins> I don't mean "animate this, starting when the user un-minimizes, and then finish 2000 ms after that"
[16:12:22] <rwaldron> you're missing what I'm saying
[16:12:30] <stephenjudkins> no, i'm not sure I am
[16:12:46] <rwaldron> i'm saying, dont do _anything_ unless the window has focus
[16:12:56] <rwaldron> This channel isn't for support
[16:13:03] <rwaldron> its for development of jQuery core
[16:13:04] <stephenjudkins> i'm not asking for support
[16:13:17] <stephenjudkins> i'm asking for a change in how jquery.animate functions
[16:13:20] <stephenjudkins> which i'd be happy to implement
[16:13:39] <stephenjudkins> i was told to come here in #jquery
[16:14:43] <stephenjudkins> i believe the new behavior of animate constitutes a bug
[16:15:00] <stephenjudkins> i would like to fix the bug, volunteering my own time
[16:15:10] <stephenjudkins> obviously, some people disagree.
[16:15:26] <rwaldron> I dont see anything in the api docs that says animate is supposed to run when the browser doesnt have focus
[16:15:51] <rwaldron> danheberden yt?
[16:17:23] <stephenjudkins> that's ridiculous: I don't see anything in the API docs that says animate is supposed to run when the user is moving the mouse around, or when he has microsoft word 5.1 running in the background
[16:17:45] <stephenjudkins> if animation doesn't work in some cases, it should be clearly state that when it doesn't work
[16:18:40] <stephenjudkins> ok, let me propose a straightforward fix:
[16:18:56] <stephenjudkins> when an animation is triggered for x ms, we also trigger a "setTimeout" call for x ms
[16:19:34] <stephenjudkins> if, when that setTimeout callback is hit, "requestAnimationFrame" has NOT been triggered, we call the fx.tick() method
[16:19:58] <stephenjudkins> if it has, we can safely do nothing
[16:21:04] <stephenjudkins> that way, when an animation is triggered in a minimized, instead of doing (x ms / framerate) callbacks and DOM manipulations, we do 1
[16:21:17] <stephenjudkins> which shouldn't have a profoundly negative effect on performance
[16:21:22] <stephenjudkins> any thoughts on this?
[16:23:02] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: ^^^
[16:25:49] <rwaldron> it sounds like it addresses your problem
[16:25:52] <rwaldron> but not mine
[16:26:19] <rwaldron> and by mine i mean everyone elses
[16:26:59] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: what's the disadvantage here? what does it break
[16:27:36] <stephenjudkins> it changes the worst-case number of callbacks / DOM manipulations in a minimized/hidden window to 1, instead of 0
[16:27:49] <rwaldron> its not that it breaks anything
[16:28:02] <stephenjudkins> a 1-second animation will have dozens of callbacks anyways
[16:28:09] <rwaldron> its that you simply want to throw more code at jquery to suit your needs
[16:28:28] <rwaldron> that bit of code i gave you is LESS code then you want to add to jQuery
[16:29:05] <rwaldron> additionally, how do you intend to test this?
[16:29:17] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: no it's not, i trigger dozens of animations in my code
[16:29:34] <stephenjudkins> i don't know, i'm only familiar with selenium testing, which is really bad at these sorts of things
[16:29:37] <stephenjudkins> how are animations tested now?
[16:30:08] <rwaldron> so, basically it sounds tome like you've got a spaghetti code problem... why didnt you write a single animation handler?
[16:30:20] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: i'm calling jquery.animate
[16:30:31] <stephenjudkins> wasn't aware I need to abstract that away, it's got a pretty nice API
[16:30:36] <stephenjudkins> as well as "delay" and "queue"
[16:34:25] <jaubourg> I dunno rick
[16:35:01] <jaubourg> when I was thinking about an animation rewrite, I came to the conclusion you'd need a timer system to "pass" animations in case requestAnimationFrame is not called
[16:35:07] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins anytime you use something >1 time, you should probably abstract it's usage
[16:35:13] <rwaldron> or it becomes unmanageable
[16:35:40] <jaubourg> I don't think relying solely on requestAnimationFrame is sustainable in the long run
[16:35:43] <rwaldron> either way, I have to get going
[16:35:44] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: but then i'm calling the abstraction multiple times
[16:35:51] <rwaldron> i can't sit here all night long and argue
[16:35:57] <jaubourg> :P
[16:36:04] <jaubourg> go have some fun my friend
[16:36:11] <rwaldron> take your chances with writing a patch
[16:36:22] <rwaldron> and submitting a pull request
[16:36:32] <stephenjudkins> doing so
[16:36:40] <stephenjudkins> i'm guessing I can expect further opposition from you
[16:36:44] <rwaldron> jaubourg thanks dude :)
[16:36:55] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: I do appreciate your work on jquery, BTW
[16:37:15] <stephenjudkins> don't take it personally
[16:37:15] <rwaldron> my concern is not your application
[16:37:24] <stephenjudkins> my concern is the correctness of jquery in general
[16:37:32] <rwaldron> its the other 19,000,000 jquery users
[16:37:38] <stephenjudkins> correctness > performance in most cases, for me.
[16:37:53] <rwaldron> right

[16:38:11] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/mQD6Ar @rwaldron: Just because you think it's a bug, doesn't mean it's a bug. Most of the time you're doing it wrong #softwaredevelopment
[16:38:15] <rwaldron> I stand by what i said
[16:38:25] <rwaldron> stil true, 10 days later
[16:48:52] <kswedberg> jaubourg: yt?
[16:53:12] <jaubourg> yep karl
[16:53:13] <jaubourg> sup?
[16:53:20] <kswedberg> howdy stranger!
[16:53:28] <jaubourg> :)
[16:53:45] <kswedberg> wondering what you think of this documentation request:
[16:54:01] <kswedberg> "When doing jsonp requests, by default the cache parameter seems to be set to false, which causes jQuery to append the parameter &_=<rand> to the query. This may cause some errors when doing calls that do not expect this parameter (for example, calling the Dailymotion api with this parameter will return error 400. Setting cache to false won't append this parameter and will fix the problem). I think this is worth adding to the c
[16:54:44] <jaubourg> I thought we had it covered in the cache option description in the API?
[16:54:51] <jaubourg> or am I mistaken?
[16:54:59] <kswedberg> ah. maybe so. lemme check.
[16:55:24] <jaubourg> yep, in default values
[16:55:32] <jaubourg> maybe it's not "in your face" enough?
[16:56:31] <jaubourg> hey mike :)
[16:56:41] <kswedberg> yeah, I think the issue is the "_" param
[16:57:15] <jaubourg> silly Data API not ignoring parameters they don't understand :/
[16:57:16] <kswedberg> that's what cache: false does?
[16:57:27] <kswedberg> yeah. :/
[16:57:50] <jaubourg> yes, data: false will add &_=timestamp to the url
[16:58:09] <jaubourg> the request seems reasonable to me
[16:58:16] <kswedberg> data: false?
[16:58:23] <jaubourg> cache: false
[16:58:26] * jaubourg spanks himself
[16:58:26] <kswedberg> :)
[16:58:45] <jaubourg> I'm working on a proxy transport for ajaxHooks so everything's mixed up in my poor little head
[16:59:45] <kswedberg> haha. ok. I'll add a note to the cache option about it adding &_=timestamp to the query string
[16:59:59] <jaubourg> coolness, you're the man :)
[17:00:43] <kswedberg> awww
[17:02:30] <stephenjudkins> jaubourg: i have a potential (1-line) fix for the thing i was griping about before
[17:03:08] <stephenjudkins> who should I run this by? just do a pull request?
[17:03:23] <jaubourg> stephen: *1* line? man, I looked at the issue before and I'm eager to see how long this 1 line will be ;)
[17:03:28] <jaubourg> yep, pull request
[17:03:36] <jaubourg> and expect comments from rick ;)
[17:03:43] <stephenjudkins> i'm steeling myself
[17:04:13] <stephenjudkins> i would really like to know how someone would go about writing test-cases for this
[17:04:25] <jaubourg> I doubt it's possible
[17:04:34] <stephenjudkins> it's really pretty browser-dependent, and selenium is really terrible for this sort of thing
[17:05:00] <stephenjudkins> honestly, it would be nice to have a super-elaborate "test harness" mock browser that simulates this stuff
[17:05:24] <stephenjudkins> hmm, looks like it's still falling down on "delay"
[17:05:30] <jaubourg> well, we do as best as we can so far, but yeah, real ui testing would be awesome
[17:05:35] <jaubourg> and hi timmy :)
[17:06:34] <jaubourg> stephen: when I looked at it, I came to the conclusion you needed a timer to handle the queue in parallel to requestAnimationFrame doing the heavy lifting
[17:06:45] <jaubourg> couldn't find any other way
[17:07:26] <stephenjudkins> jaubourg: yeah, i just had a setTimeout set to fire fx.tick() at the end of the animation
[17:08:25] <jaubourg> alternative is to pre-compute timestamps on animation steps so that you know where you are when requestAnimationFrame is finally called... but then you have all queued callbacks called one after the other... how the nightmare
[17:08:28] <jaubourg> how = oh
[17:09:15] <jaubourg> stephen: adding a setTimeout for each queued animation will be really really bad from a performance point of view... and wrong from a timing point of view
[17:09:19] <jaubourg> timing is key here
[17:09:37] <stephenjudkins> jaubourg: for each queued animation? i'm just doing it when the animation starts
[17:09:43] <stephenjudkins> and the setTimeout is only called once per-animation
[17:09:52] <jaubourg> per-animation per-element
[17:09:57] <stephenjudkins> ahh
[17:09:58] <jaubourg> queue is per element, remember?
[17:10:11] <jaubourg> a nightmare I tell you
[17:11:26] <jaubourg> and here comes teh Dave
[17:11:28] <jaubourg> :)
[17:12:31] <DaveMethvin> hey dere!
[17:13:01] <DaveMethvin> okay, i have been really lazy and need to get going on jquery stuff...
[17:13:50] <jaubourg> tell me about it
[17:14:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was thinking about submitting a talk for the conf
[17:14:28] <DaveMethvin> and then i thought "what if i don't get it done?" :)
[17:15:05] <jaubourg> submitted one... I still dunno if I'll go to jsconf.eu but I added in the comments for the proposal to jqcon that I would sync with someone who goes to jqcon in case I can't
[17:15:12] <jaubourg> it's about $.Callbacks
[17:16:10] <jaubourg> sooooo, if I can't make it to boston, I'd gladly sync with you on this, Dave ;)
[17:16:37] <DaveMethvin> you have to come, jaubourg!
[17:16:45] <DaveMethvin> it's just an ocean away
[17:17:25] <jaubourg> yeah, I admit I'm more tempted by boston than berlin but heh, I thought jqcon would not be at the exact same date when I proposed for jsconf.eu
[17:17:26] <jaubourg> :/
[17:17:50] <jaubourg> also, it would be nice if we had someone at jsconf.eu
[17:17:59] <DaveMethvin> i completely understand, and agree we should show the flag there
[17:18:57] <jaubourg> anyway, I intend to make slides about progress callbacks in $.Deferred and about $.Callbacks... think jqcon boston would be ideal to introduce new 1.7 features like this
[17:20:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was thinking the same about introducing the new event changes
[17:20:27] <jaubourg> really not sure I'll be picked up for jsconf.eu anyway, seeing as I proposed a very general Deferred-related talk
[17:20:53] <jaubourg> was short on time and ideas when I needed to make the proposal
[17:21:04] <jaubourg> man, you so should present those changes
[17:23:44] <DaveMethvin> You're right, I'll do a quick writeup
[17:23:56] <DaveMethvin> they're due ... er, right now
[17:34:38] <kswedberg> jaubourg: I added the _=timestamp stuff to the doc for both the cache option and the dataType option (jsonp/script).
[17:36:47] <DaveMethvin> hmm, it occurs to me that JohnResig may want to present the "what's new with jQuery 1.7" in his keynote
[17:37:08] <DaveMethvin> so i don't know if we need a separate session for it
[17:49:09] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[17:49:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: heyhey
[17:49:41] <DaveMethvin> so did you submit a talk for jqcon
[17:50:12] <timmywil> i did, "attributes in jQuery"
[17:50:16] <DaveMethvin> cool
[17:50:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you?
[17:50:31] <DaveMethvin> thinkin about doing on on events
[17:50:35] <DaveMethvin> one
[17:50:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: good, I was hoping you would
[17:50:53] <timmywil> last day is today!
[17:51:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:51:07] <DaveMethvin> what's the hurry, i have 3 hours
[17:51:11] <timmywil> hehe
[17:51:11] <DaveMethvin> :)

[18:24:37] <bot-t> rwaldron, Stored "bugs".
[18:27:26] <stephenjudkins> can anyone point me to a jquery animation benchmark?
[19:49:20] <DaveMethvin> stephenjudkins: I don't know of a benchmark, maybe timmywil or gnarf know?
[19:50:09] <DaveMethvin> I have concerns that https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/435 would negate many benefits of requestAnimationFrame
[19:50:17] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: why?
[19:50:23] <DaveMethvin> if a window isn't visible we shouldn't be animating
[19:50:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin++
[19:50:47] <stephenjudkins> the number of "animations" would be a small fraction of what we see on a visible window
[19:50:57] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins have you been arguing for 3 hours?
[19:51:06] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: chill out
[19:51:15] <stephenjudkins> i've been reading source and writing this patch for 3 hours
[19:51:22] <DaveMethvin> i just got here ...
[19:51:54] <stephenjudkins> anyways, with this patch, animation callbacks will be fired *once* per animation when a window isn't visible
[19:52:23] <DaveMethvin> so the intent is to keep things moving along somehow?
[19:52:40] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: yes, make the necessary changes to the DOM, call the next thing in the queue
[19:53:07] <DaveMethvin> but if the intent was to animate in order to show something to the user, we didn't attain that goal
[19:53:31] <DaveMethvin> i think the slideshow is the perfect example of that
[19:53:41] <DaveMethvin> why should the slides continue to advance?
[19:54:16] <stephenjudkins> my app, for example, is getting triggered by events through a comet-like message bus
[19:54:58] <DaveMethvin> ok but what if the user has the app minimized? why show anything?
[19:55:01] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i had recommended earlier that stephenjudkins could avoid adding animations to his queue while the window was out of focus... http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/KK5mP/
[19:55:09] <rwaldron> which would stop the pile up he was experiencing
[19:55:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah that sounds like a good approach
[19:55:25] <rwaldron> I thought so
[19:55:26] <stephenjudkins> because we have a bunch of animations that actively change the DOM
[19:55:51] <DaveMethvin> oh, like actively modify the content?
[19:56:13] <rwaldron> ^^ to that I still suggest abstracting your animation to ONE method that can handle squashing the animation or playing it
[19:56:16] <stephenjudkins> well, they do on callbacks afterwards
[19:56:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah like decouple the animation effects from the document modifications
[19:56:47] <DaveMethvin> then only do animations when the user sees them
[19:57:06] <DaveMethvin> really though, even the comet polling is a waste while the window is out of
[19:57:17] <DaveMethvin> focus unless you're doing some sort of notifications
[19:57:27] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: we're playing sounds
[19:57:30] <stephenjudkins> for what it's worth
[19:57:49] <DaveMethvin> man, i'm starting to hate this app and i hardly know anything about it :P
[19:58:12] <DaveMethvin> ok so the sounds are like status-related?
[19:58:24] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: it's a poker game
[19:58:36] <DaveMethvin> NOW i hate it :)
[19:58:41] <stephenjudkins> sorry about that
[19:58:59] <stephenjudkins> anyways, the current behavior, IMO, makes http://api.jquery.com/delay/ not follow its contract
[19:59:42] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins here's what I'm talking about, to give you a good idea: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/zGnRx/
[19:59:58] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: thanks, you posted that once before
[20:00:04] <rwaldron> nooooo
[20:00:06] <DaveMethvin> for the purposes of animations, i think the behavior of rAF is good
[20:00:10] <rwaldron> this has MORE stuff
[20:00:12] <rwaldron> smart ass
[20:00:19] <rwaldron> we're volunteers
[20:00:22] <DaveMethvin> but i see how it could hose some designs
[20:00:41] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: i'm volunteering now too
[20:01:20] <DaveMethvin> stephenjudkins: i really do want to understand the use case
[20:01:33] <stephenjudkins> and, that doesn't do much of anything to help me with "delay" or "queue"
[20:01:36] <DaveMethvin> but my thought is that this patch probably isn't one we'd want as-is
[20:01:41] <rwaldron> ...you've been in here since 7 complaining about your app's edge case issue, that frankly, I blame on bad design...
[20:01:52] <rwaldron> pet bugs
[20:01:54] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i think it's more nuanced than that
[20:02:09] <DaveMethvin> we
[20:02:30] <DaveMethvin> 've got the history of setTimeout-based animations and then something better
[20:02:41] <DaveMethvin> comes along and ppl don't like that it behaves differently
[20:03:23] <DaveMethvin> it may be a bad design now that we have rAF
[20:03:28] <stephenjudkins> jquery is a library depended on by a *ton* of people. many people rely on behavior you might not have anticipated, but may really be part of the API's contract
[20:04:11] <DaveMethvin> it's hard enough to keep the documented contract without having to deal with undocumented behavior
[20:04:39] <DaveMethvin> but we need to give people a way to accomplish the goal
[20:04:55] <DaveMethvin> that may not involve reinstating undocumented behavior
[20:05:18] <stephenjudkins> anyways, my use case: we have a table DOM, with tons of code in animation callbacks, and a lot of uses of "delay" and "queue"
[20:06:11] <DaveMethvin> i want to take a look at rwaldron
[20:06:14] <DaveMethvin> 's code
[20:06:57] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: what part of the style guidelines didn't i follow?
[20:07:17] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins whitespace
[20:07:34] <rwaldron> I'd recommend just reading the entire thing before getting stand offish
[20:07:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah spaces around if ( )
[20:07:36] <rwaldron> kthx
[20:09:25] <stephenjudkins> fixed
[20:10:17] <DaveMethvin> imma let gnarf and timmywil weigh in on this, they have been looking at the issue for a while
[20:10:49] <rwaldron> stephenjudkins "many people rely on behavior you might not have anticipated, but may really be part of the API's contract" If we follow this ideal, we should jsut roll back the ajax and attr rewrites.
[20:10:57] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin stop re-writing events...NOW
[20:11:18] <DaveMethvin> well i can guarantee we are gonna break stuff if we change stuff
[20:11:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i was thinking the same
[20:11:30] <DaveMethvin> but stephenjudkins does have some good use cases
[20:11:37] <rwaldron> gnarf is brilliant with this stuff
[20:11:47] <DaveMethvin> i think your code for not doing the anims when not in focus is good
[20:11:48] <rwaldron> i havent seen a shred of code
[20:12:00] <DaveMethvin> but the doc should still update based on comet updates
[20:12:06] <DaveMethvin> so the q is how to do that design
[20:12:11] <rwaldron> that supports saying "some good use cases"
[20:13:01] <DaveMethvin> well lets say you are animating a graph of data fed by a comet feed in real time
[20:13:30] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin if the animation  and document visual state logic have been designed correctly, ie. decoupled, then there is no problem
[20:13:52] <rwaldron> when out of focus, skip animation, jump to updated visual state
[20:13:55] <rwaldron> avoid pile up
[20:14:13] <DaveMethvin> for the animated state, the animation does the change
[20:14:24] <DaveMethvin> like for the bar you're going to animate height:30 or whatever
[20:14:29] <rwaldron> right, but that final state can be a class no?
[20:14:37] <rwaldron> its jsut css?
[20:15:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah most likely you'd need two paths, one for out of focus (.css) and one for in focus (.animate)
[20:15:09] <rwaldron> right, animate({ height: "30px" })
[20:15:18] <rwaldron> css({ height: "30px" })
[20:15:22] <rwaldron> ...?
[20:16:06] <DaveMethvin> hey waitaminit, what happens if you toggle jQuery.fx.off?
[20:16:48] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: i've done that
[20:17:00] <DaveMethvin> well then you're ahead of me :)
[20:17:00] <stephenjudkins> look, my app is fixed
[20:17:06] <stephenjudkins> i'm just trying to fix jquery now
[20:17:25] <DaveMethvin> so what was your fix?
[20:17:29] <stephenjudkins> obviously this is not the lowest-resistance path for me to get my app's bugs addressed
[20:17:49] <stephenjudkins> basically what rwaldron suggested
[20:18:08] <rwaldron> you could even store the animating properties in props...
[20:18:19] <rwaldron> because I like to deliver on my word...
[20:18:20] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/zGnRx/
[20:18:21] <stephenjudkins> but it is, in my opinion, in inelegant solution to a bug in jquery itself
[20:18:22] <rwaldron> updated!
[20:18:32] <rwaldron> now with more problem solving goodness
[20:18:44] <rwaldron> wow, that's insulting.
[20:18:51] <rwaldron> "inelegant"
[20:18:59] <rwaldron> coming from the heavily coupled code guy
[20:19:01] <rwaldron> thanks.
[20:19:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: don't be so easily insulted
[20:19:15] <stephenjudkins> yeah, relax
[20:19:20] <rwaldron> i'm kidding
[20:19:25] <rwaldron> yeesh
[20:19:27] <stephenjudkins> but not about my code
[20:19:36] <stephenjudkins> don't worry i have a thick skin.
[20:19:40] <rwaldron> who knows? i've never even seen it
[20:20:14] <rwaldron> this issue could very easily be duck punched
[20:20:16] <stephenjudkins> you'd probably find a lot of ways to clean it up
[20:20:23] <rwaldron> ...going to do that now
[20:20:55] <stephenjudkins> http://dpaste.com/569555/
[20:20:56] <stephenjudkins> dne
[20:22:41] <stephenjudkins> i have never heard "duck punch" before today
[20:23:17] <DaveMethvin> well anyway, i'm gonna take off but stephenjudkins your particular case seems legit ... dunno if that patch is a solution but thanks for the background about the app
[20:26:38] <stephenjudkins> DaveMethvin: have a good night
[20:26:51] <stephenjudkins> rwaldron: hope you know it's not personal...but you should relax about this
[20:27:10] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/phpXw/
[20:27:35] <rwaldron> $.fn.animate with some added brain
[20:27:52] <rwaldron> ugh... who said anything about personal?
[20:28:12] <rwaldron> I'm arguing for the other 19,000,000 sites using jquery
[20:28:17] <stephenjudkins> sure you are
[20:28:40] <rwaldron> that don't need/want/have use for the changes you want to make
[20:28:48] <rwaldron> in fact, i kind of hate rAF
[20:28:51] <rwaldron> so how about that?
[20:29:41] <rwaldron> i think the vendor prefixed cluster fuck that it adds to the effects module is something to be ashamed of
[20:29:54] <rwaldron> but it gives us great performance
[20:30:05] <rwaldron> and thats important
[20:31:07] <stephenjudkins> so, suppose I come back with a set of benchmarks showing FPS / CPU usage is only marginally worse with this patch. am I correct to guess you'd still be opposed?
[20:31:51] <rwaldron> are you familiar with statistical significance?
[20:33:01] <stephenjudkins> please relax and drop the patronizing tone. yes, i am quite familiar
[20:33:11] <rwaldron> ugh
[20:33:17] <rwaldron> dude, I'm not being patronizing
[20:33:28] <rwaldron> i was asking a question
[20:33:36] <rwaldron> if you didnt know, i would've explained
[20:33:39] <rwaldron> ...anyway...
[20:35:00] <rwaldron> so if the differences arent statistically significant, that I would gladly support exploring a way to make the behaviour more consistent
[20:35:36] <rwaldron> or even provide or find a way to provide the best of both
[20:36:28] <rwaldron> btw, i'm sitting on my bed with my dogs... so i'm pretty relaxed
[20:36:30] <rwaldron> :)
[20:38:23] <stephenjudkins> and i'm very late to something
[20:38:32] <stephenjudkins> so, i want to get this fixed
[20:38:37] <stephenjudkins> let's work to figure out a solution.
[20:38:38] <stephenjudkins> farewell.
