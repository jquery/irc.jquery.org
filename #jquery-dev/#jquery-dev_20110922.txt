[00:36:25] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2sImJA
[00:36:25] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fixes a weird IE7 bug in the unit tests. If anybody can shed some light on this one, I'm a taker. - jaubourg
[00:36:46] <jaubourg> ?tell DaveMethvin http://git.io/2sImJA
[00:36:46] <bot-t> (4 hours 11 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell jaubourg I'm seeing a test fail in IE7 all the way back to 1.6.4 at http://localhost/jquery/test/?filter=jQuery.post%20-%20data ... ideas?
[00:36:47] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[00:39:46] <gnarf> wtf
[05:55:29] <DaveMethvin> .
[05:55:30] <bot-t> (5 hours 18 mins ago) <jaubourg> tell DaveMethvin http://git.io/2sImJA
[05:56:11] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: maybe the Qunit update has something to do with it
[05:56:27] <DaveMethvin> i just realized that in the shower this morning
[05:56:45] <DaveMethvin> do my best thinking in the shower, i should bring my computer in there
[06:03:18] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: hey
[06:03:40] <DaveMethvin> i have an idea for the event fix hooks
[06:03:51] <rwaldron> cool
[06:03:56] <rwaldron> lay it on me
[06:04:15] <DaveMethvin> so if we had some way that the hook could say "don't do your normal fixups, i don't need them"
[06:04:18] <DaveMethvin> like returning false
[06:04:32] <DaveMethvin> that would let it work a lot faster
[06:05:07] <DaveMethvin> so the hook coudl be at the top of fix, before the loop copying props
[06:05:07] <rwaldron> hm
[06:05:17] <rwaldron> yeah
[06:05:24] <DaveMethvin> or something
[06:05:33] * rwaldron digs in
[06:06:23] <rwaldron> morning timmywil
[06:06:34] <timmywil> rwaldron: morning!
[06:07:22] <DaveMethvin> we are getting close to just 100 bugs btw
[06:07:43] <timmywil> rock!
[06:07:47] <jaubourg> afternoon all
[06:07:48] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i'm looking at the code now, but it's not clear
[06:07:50] <DaveMethvin> a few more enhancements, and pending tickets, but we put a BIG dent in it
[06:08:29] <rwaldron> (btw, what is the ticket list your looking at? link? )
[06:09:03] <timmywil> These are all of the open 1.7 tickets http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.7&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&report=206&order=status
[06:09:11] <rwaldron> ok
[06:09:19] <timmywil> but that's something else
[06:09:21] <DaveMethvin> the standard "open bugs by component" shows 110 tickets
[06:09:23] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&component=!datalink&component=!global&component=!templates&component=!web&type=bug&group=component&report=1&order=priority
[06:09:37] <rwaldron> i just changed the title
[06:09:43] <rwaldron> it said "1.6.3"
[06:09:47] <rwaldron> => 1.7
[06:10:12] <timmywil> yea, i had adapted from the 1.6.3 list
[06:10:40] <DaveMethvin> so...can we get all those done by, say, monday?
[06:10:53] <DaveMethvin> some aren't even assigned, stuff keeps appearing on this list :)
[06:11:42] <rwaldron> timmywil i figured :)
[06:11:49] <rwaldron> monday seems reasonable
[06:12:04] <DaveMethvin> oh here's an easy one, docs#9385 ... we just have to begrudgingly re-land it :P
[06:12:05] <bot-t> [#9385] Add Google Chrome to jQuery.browser (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9385
[06:12:08] <rwaldron> what's the deal with jQuery.browser.chrome
[06:12:12] <rwaldron> psst
[06:12:15] <rwaldron> pfftttttt*
[06:12:16] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[06:12:36] <rwaldron> i wonder if my patch will still work?
[06:13:10] <timmywil> ugh
[06:13:27] <rwaldron> timmywil +1
[06:13:34] <DaveMethvin> so was there some discussion in the meeting about this one? the vote was against it but i left before it was discussed
[06:13:49] <DaveMethvin> if we are going to keep $.browser i think it should be there
[06:14:01] <DaveMethvin> and we can split it off later in working order
[06:14:48] <timmywil> I don't think it should be there unless we also want to add $.browser.safari
[06:15:16] <timmywil> which is actually there, but is identical to $.browser.webkit
[06:15:30] <DaveMethvin> well i don't  have a problem with leaving it out for 1.7 since it was voted down, and we can bring up the topic again for 1.8
[06:15:37] <rwaldron> ok
[06:15:44] <rwaldron> that's fine with me
[06:15:48] <timmywil> agreed
[06:15:58] <DaveMethvin> that's why i wondered if there was some discussion in the meeting, i was surprised to see it
[06:16:01] <DaveMethvin> given the vote
[06:16:11] <rwaldron> i moved it to 1.8
[06:16:14] <timmywil> yea, i was confused about that too.
[06:16:19] <rwaldron> and added "1.8-discuss"
[06:16:19] <timmywil> also missed that meeting
[06:16:50] <DaveMethvin> ok so at least we can plead ignorance if someone asks
[06:17:58] <rwaldron> i cant even find notes about it in the roadmap doc
[06:18:00] <rwaldron> so...
[06:18:04] <rwaldron> we're in the clear?
[06:18:31] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin still not really clear about the suggestion for fix
[06:19:13] <DaveMethvin> right now, the hook can only add more stuff to do once the "standard" stuff is complete
[06:19:30] <DaveMethvin> but there might be times when you don't want to do the "standard" stuff
[06:19:31] <rwaldron> righ
[06:19:37] <rwaldron> right*
[06:20:01] <DaveMethvin> two examples: a custom event that has no event properties, and an event that you want to be very fast like mouseover
[06:20:13] <rwaldron> ok
[06:20:15] <rwaldron> so...
[06:20:19] <DaveMethvin> so if there was a way to have the hook return false to say, don't do the rest
[06:20:29] <DaveMethvin> that would make it fast
[06:20:37] <DaveMethvin> if it doesn't return false the normal procesing happens
[06:20:44] <rwaldron> ... a custom event that has no event properties... these get run through jQuery.event.propHooks elsewhere
[06:21:01] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah and i wanted to see why that was
[06:21:22] <rwaldron> same reason I explained previously :P
[06:21:29] <DaveMethvin> the expando is set?
[06:21:34] <rwaldron> custom events don't make it past
[06:21:35] <rwaldron> 		if ( event[ jQuery.expando ] ) {
[06:21:35] <rwaldron> 			return event;
[06:21:35] <rwaldron> 		}
[06:21:47] <DaveMethvin> well the expando got set somewhere
[06:22:06] <rwaldron> jQuery.Event
[06:22:10] <rwaldron> last line
[06:22:14] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[06:22:23] <DaveMethvin> i forgot it does that!
[06:22:51] <DaveMethvin> ok then that makes sense
[06:23:06] <DaveMethvin> now...should the hook be there at alll?
[06:23:24] <DaveMethvin> if we're not fix-ing custom events why would we run them through fix hooks?
[06:23:35] <DaveMethvin> so many questions
[06:24:05] <DaveMethvin> if the hooks are meant to fix native events then it doesn't belong in jQuery.Event
[06:24:14] <DaveMethvin> i would lean towards taking it out rwaldron
[06:24:29] <jaubourg> still need a review of callbacks.js and deferred.js especially since it has been reduced
[06:25:21] <timmywil> jaubourg: that was my only concern
[06:25:30] <timmywil> so you took care of it
[06:26:19] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: I'll make a note to look at it
[06:26:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... well... tbh...
[06:26:28] <rwaldron> so it can be tested
[06:26:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah testing can be a pain
[06:26:55] <rwaldron> i think we need to make use of that simulator plugin
[06:26:57] <rwaldron> or write one
[06:27:00] <rwaldron> or something
[06:27:07] <rwaldron> anyway, i thought it would be useful
[06:27:10] <DaveMethvin> something indeed
[06:27:25] <DaveMethvin> i just slogged through a dozen bugs in ie that unit tests cannot repro
[06:27:41] <rwaldron> but more importantly, i dont like the idea of an api that allows something for only 50% of itself
[06:28:13] <DaveMethvin> but anyway, i don't think the hooks should be in jQuery.Event b/c the idea of the hooks is to normalize native events
[06:28:36] <DaveMethvin> if you trigger a mouseover you're responsible for setting all the event props yourself
[06:29:31] <rwaldron> right
[06:29:58] <rwaldron> i didn't want to put it in jQuery.Event because event prop hooks are a minority use case
[06:30:08] <rwaldron> compared to just, ya know, regs event objects
[06:31:41] <rwaldron> so...
[06:31:49] <rwaldron> what next?
[06:33:50] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to have some way for the hook to short-circuit fix if needed, like by returning false
[06:34:03] <DaveMethvin> and it shoudln't be called in Event
[06:35:03] <rwaldron> i have an idea
[06:35:08] <rwaldron> let me try
[06:35:13] <rwaldron> i'll get back to you
[06:42:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i have something we can remove from fix
[06:42:34] <rwaldron> small... but should come out easily
[06:42:37] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1925
[06:42:41] <rwaldron> a safari 2 bug
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> 		// Fix target property, if necessary
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> 		if ( !event.target ) {
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> 			// Fixes #1925 where srcElement might not be defined either
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> 			event.target = event.srcElement || document;
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> 		}
[06:44:05] <rwaldron> we can also move the code under " Add which for key events " as hooks for _just_ key events
[06:44:24] <rwaldron> and "Add metaKey to non-Mac browsers (use ctrl for PC's and Meta for Macs)"
[06:45:57] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yeah i wondered about a lot of those when i looked through it, it could be that half of that isn't even needed anymore
[06:46:36] <rwaldron> of the 3 i mentioned, the second two are jQuery specific normalizations
[06:46:40] <rwaldron> the first can go
[06:46:48] <rwaldron> or rather, I plan to confirm
[06:47:44] <DaveMethvin> well any time you see a ticket numbered #1925 ....
[06:48:05] <rwaldron> right
[06:48:12] <DaveMethvin> and yeah i wonder about the key events
[06:48:12] <rwaldron> Safari 3
[06:48:15] <rwaldron> no, 2
[06:49:08] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: do you want to be on the google groups bugs list twice? you have a gmail and a gnarf.net
[06:49:21] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: thats preferable actually
[06:49:24] <gnarf> i don't check my gmail
[06:49:28] <gnarf> that often
[06:49:33] <gnarf> but i use it to login to google
[06:49:37] <DaveMethvin> i can leave them both on but it looked funny
[06:49:44] <gnarf> so the gmail is there so i can edit the docs
[06:49:48] <DaveMethvin> so i figured i'd check while i was in here
[06:49:50] <DaveMethvin> k
[06:49:53] <gnarf> the gnarf.net is there so i read the emails
[06:49:53] <gnarf> :)
[06:53:43] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[06:53:46] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/QeNeR/3/ WOOO!
[06:53:54] <rwaldron> we can remove that safari shit
[06:54:17] <rwaldron> bug no longer exists in jQuery supported safaris :D
[06:54:23] <rwaldron> timmywil ^
[06:55:19] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[06:55:24] <DaveMethvin> saves bytes too
[06:55:53] <DaveMethvin> what's the oldest safari on the original iphone? is athat 3?
[06:56:07] <rwaldron> i believe
[06:56:13] <rwaldron> safari 2 is like... pre iphone
[06:56:38] <rwaldron> I've also updated the original ticket
[06:56:43] <rwaldron> noting the removal
[06:56:46] <rwaldron> ...just in case
[06:57:12] <timmywil> nice
[06:57:24] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1925#comment:4
[06:58:10] <timmywil> even says in the ticket that 2.0.4 didn't have the bug
[06:58:24] <timmywil> so that's good
[06:58:58] <timmywil> gnarf: how you feeling about your open 1.7 tickets?
[06:59:10] <timmywil> I'm all done with mine so I can pick up any of them
[06:59:14] <gnarf> timmywil: upset that they are taking bytes :)
[06:59:21] <gnarf> the two blockers have pulls up
[06:59:35] <gnarf> i haven't thought much about the exception one
[06:59:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i ended up owning a sizzle-related bug i'd be happy to give you :)
[06:59:48] <gnarf> if you're just looking for a ticket to work on
[06:59:50] <DaveMethvin> it's the getText one
[07:00:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i can do that
[07:00:42] <timmywil> gnarf: i was looking at docs#4660
[07:00:44] <bot-t> gnarf, [#4660] fadeTo() does not fade-in elements after hide() or fadeOut() is called on them (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/4660
[07:00:44] <timmywil> low priority
[07:01:07] <gnarf> that one should be easy too
[07:01:14] <timmywil> yea
[07:01:17] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: I'll move it to you
[07:01:18] <gnarf> feel free, haven't done anything with any of the tickets other than the blockers
[07:01:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: cool
[07:01:43] <timmywil> alright, I'll take those two for now
[07:01:48] <gnarf> timmywil: Did you ever look more at pull 514?
[07:01:56] <gnarf> the stop hooks stuff
[07:02:19] <timmywil> gnarf: not yet, but I'll take a closer look tonight
[07:02:52] <rwaldron> I've moved all the event.metayKey and event.which to their own prop hooks
[07:03:05] <rwaldron> for key* events
[07:08:23] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: nice
[07:09:30] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin more shaving...
[07:09:37] <rwaldron> jQuery.event.propHooks => this.propHooks
[07:09:43] <rwaldron> inside of jQuery.event.fix
[07:27:54] <rwaldron> ugh
[07:27:57] <rwaldron> scratch all that
[07:28:20] <rwaldron> for some reason i just crashed IE6 and 7 several times
[07:28:25] <rwaldron> (it's consistent)
[07:44:40] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: you are the owner for docs#8142, was that intentional?
[07:44:41] <bot-t> kswedberg, #8142 (outerhtml) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 6 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8142
[07:45:57] <kswedberg> ha. I don't think so. :) but better ask rwaldron, since he's the one who assigned it to me.
[07:46:57] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin kswedberg from 1.7 roadmap vote results:
[07:46:58] <rwaldron> nope, make page explaining why no outerHTML	not closed, but added "needsdocs"
[07:46:59] <DaveMethvin> sneaky little bugger
[07:47:12] <kswedberg> aha!
[07:47:15] <rwaldron> that was copy/pasted exactly as is
[07:47:17] <rwaldron> "nope, make page explaining why no outerHTML	not closed, but added "needsdocs""
[07:47:28] <DaveMethvin> ok, so i'll close it then
[07:47:31] <rwaldron> cool
[07:47:32] <gnarf> rwaldron: that should be a non-saving gziped anyway...
[07:47:34] <DaveMethvin> generally i think we've been closing docs-only tix
[07:47:45] <gnarf> this / jQuery.event are prolly both "strings" in the gzip
[07:47:47] <rwaldron> gnarf huh?
[07:47:56] <rwaldron> o
[07:48:35] <kswedberg> I guess I should figure out how to track issues on trac, esp when assigned to me or when needsdocs is added
[07:48:36] <rwaldron> eh, i'll come back to that
[07:48:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i've identified 2 conditions in fix that will consistently crash IE6,7,8
[07:49:00] <rwaldron> when running the test suite
[07:49:06] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: you can do a search for the needsdocs keyword, addyosmani has been keeping a pretty close eye on it
[07:49:12] <rwaldron> so... unfortunately, those stay
[07:49:18] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: np
[07:49:36] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yeah, but I want, like, notification or something. because I'm lazy. :)
[07:49:54] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron what is the needsdocs for that outerhtml supposed to be?
[07:50:17] <DaveMethvin> "use replaceWith" or something perhaps?
[07:50:36] * rwaldron shrugs
[07:50:47] <rwaldron> sorry, i honestly dont remember
[07:50:52] <DaveMethvin> lol well you quoted the notes
[07:50:55] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:51:00] <rwaldron> because i opened the doc
[07:51:05] <rwaldron> and copy/pasted
[07:51:06] <rwaldron> :P
[07:51:08] <rwaldron> hahahah
[07:51:21] <DaveMethvin> stand still, i gotta shoot the messenger
[07:51:25] <rwaldron> ok
[07:51:25] <DaveMethvin> :)
[07:51:31] <rwaldron> not the face
[07:51:52] <rwaldron> I've added comments to event.js re: dont remove this, it will crash
[07:56:00] <rwaldron> gnarf +9001 dude
[07:56:11] <rwaldron> i just switched BACK to jQuery.event
[07:56:15] <rwaldron> and it compresses smaller
[07:56:22] <rwaldron> gzip*
[07:58:06] <gnarf> rwaldron: sad isnt it?
[07:58:36] <rwaldron> eh, not really
[07:58:42] <rwaldron> well, yeah
[07:58:51] <rwaldron> but i'm too stoked that you caught that
[07:58:53] <rwaldron> to be upset
[07:58:55] <rwaldron> :D
[07:59:05] <gnarf> rwaldron: habbit
[07:59:14] <gnarf> rwaldron: i usually think to golf vars like that
[07:59:21] <gnarf> but it really doesn't do much in gzip counts
[07:59:41] <rwaldron> ps. commit messages dont like !
[07:59:43] <gnarf> i actually would have done like a var jqEvent = jQuery.event
[07:59:55] <rwaldron> hm
[07:59:58] <gnarf> rwaldron: its your shell that doesn;t like the bang most likely....
[08:00:05] <rwaldron> lemme see if i can squash down wit that
[08:00:07] <rwaldron> with*
[08:00:15] <gnarf> but i think even the jqEvent / jQuery.event.
[08:00:21] <rwaldron> like...
[08:00:23] <gnarf> still will be basically similar in gzip
[08:00:34] <rwaldron> var jQueryeventpropHooks = jQuery.event.propHooks
[08:00:37] <gnarf> but it will save property access in exchange for scope access
[08:00:38] <rwaldron> faster lookup
[08:00:47] <rwaldron> and will gzip nicely i bet
[08:01:02] <gnarf> min's better than "this" to
[08:01:03] <gnarf> too
[08:01:18] <gnarf> but gzip you'll prolly gain a byte or two
[08:04:23] <rwaldron> this balances nice...
[08:04:25] <rwaldron> propHook = jQuery.event.propHooks[ event.type ];
[08:04:39] <rwaldron> actually storing the lookup result
[08:05:15] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: re docs#9384 it's tagged for 1.7 but most likely to be addressed in 1.8, no?
[08:05:16] <bot-t> gnarf, [#9384] jQuery.fx.interval should be replaced by an 'animation-tick' throttling feature. (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9384
[08:06:54] <DaveMethvin> it was assigned to louisremi but i think that was before rAF was removed in 1.6.3
[08:07:25] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: that's it
[08:07:33] <louisremi> will see when rAF comes back
[08:08:08] <DaveMethvin> i think gnarf is planning an animation extravaganza for 1.8 so that might be the best time to tackle it
[08:08:28] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I dont really know how to resolve your request from earlier, beyond what I've done so far
[08:08:53] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: what's it look like now?
[08:09:16] <rwaldron> how do you mean?
[08:09:31] <rwaldron> i was only able to refactor the key event prop fixes
[08:10:10] <rwaldron> i dont really see how i can return false from a propHook
[08:10:16] <rwaldron> in the way that you wanted
[08:10:21] <rwaldron> i'll push and you take a look
[08:11:13] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin updated: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/502

[08:14:07] <rwaldron> ugh
[08:14:09] <rwaldron> this conflicts
[08:14:19] <rwaldron> i need to merge in some changes from master :\
[08:17:20] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: here is what i was thinking https://gist.github.com/1235041
[08:20:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin thanks for that, but it only really confirms my previous notion...
[08:20:27] <rwaldron> I guess I don't ahve a current use case is the problem
[08:20:31] <rwaldron> but i can add that in
[08:21:56] <DaveMethvin> well it's mainly a starting point for thought
[08:22:13] <rwaldron> i can add it in now
[08:22:30] <rwaldron> i just can't think of any way to prove it
[08:22:51] <DaveMethvin> the main cases we have here are the special cases already built into fix
[08:23:19] <DaveMethvin> which is fine
[08:23:23] <rwaldron> I feel like I'm missing something
[08:23:25] <rwaldron> sorry
[08:23:34] <rwaldron> i feel like I'm being "thick"
[08:23:39] <rwaldron> or umm.. "dense"
[08:24:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so, i think the problem is that we don't have any cases to prove this is a good way to do things other than the stuff already in fix
[08:24:03] <rwaldron> i just don't see the current use for this. i understand the benefit...
[08:24:10] <DaveMethvin> right
[08:24:33] <DaveMethvin> so the stuff already in fix works with the current implementation
[08:24:42] <rwaldron> yeah
[08:24:46] <DaveMethvin> but we already had that working ... so there must be other cases that can benefit from hooks
[08:24:49] <DaveMethvin> what do they need?
[08:24:50] <rwaldron> i mean.. like...
[08:25:01] <rwaldron> if we had a "*" propHook
[08:25:23] <rwaldron> that had conditions that were opposite of those in fix
[08:25:52] <DaveMethvin> when would that be used?
[08:26:00] <rwaldron> always
[08:26:05] <rwaldron> to return early?
[08:26:36] <rwaldron> actually...
[08:26:38] <rwaldron> i have an idea
[08:26:43] <rwaldron> i think i can make this work
[08:26:45] <rwaldron> one sec
[08:27:16] <DaveMethvin> i have a meeting, i'll be around this afternoon tho
[08:28:01] <rwaldron> ack
[08:28:04] <rwaldron> real quick
[08:28:04] <rwaldron> 		if ( !propHook && ( event.target && event.target.nodeType !== 3 ) && event.relatedTarget ) {
[08:28:04] <rwaldron> 			return event;
[08:28:04] <rwaldron> 		}
[08:28:13] <rwaldron> that will short circuit for ALL events
[13:17:49] <timmywil>  jrburke|away: updated to 0.26. nice work on handling exceptions
[13:40:24] <jrburke> timmywil: :)
[15:47:31] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yt?
[15:47:40] <rwaldron> yep
[15:47:45] <rwaldron> what's up?
[15:47:46] <DaveMethvin> woo hoo
[15:48:00] <DaveMethvin> sorry i had to run off, so fix ...
[15:48:07] <DaveMethvin> you had an idea on that
[15:48:19] <rwaldron> oh right
[15:48:24] <rwaldron> i think this is hot shit
[15:48:25] <rwaldron> one sec

[15:49:13] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (1w, 1d ago): 1.7 Implements event property hooks. Fixes #8789
[15:49:16] <rwaldron> this green block
[15:49:30] <rwaldron> :)
[15:49:50] <rwaldron> if there is no propHook and all the other conditions cannot be met, GTFO!
[15:50:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah but  you have to copy the props :P
[15:50:49] <rwaldron> check it
[15:51:15] <rwaldron> the genius of that line is that it will rarely actually work
[15:51:33] <rwaldron> but when it can, it will
[15:51:48] <rwaldron> either way, it passes the test suite
[15:52:09] <rwaldron> i thought you wanted to avoid that loop if there was ever a possibility to do so
[15:52:44] <DaveMethvin> definitely, but i suspect our unit tests are just sucky enough to not find a problem
[15:53:17] <DaveMethvin> in the docs for event we say that everything in that props list will be copied from originalEvent to event
[15:53:29] <DaveMethvin> but now it won't get copied
[15:53:51] <DaveMethvin> i dunno which ones really *need* to be copied, and it may be that we're wasting time copying them
[15:54:20] <DaveMethvin> like altKey .. okay sure for key* events, does it get passed for mouse ones?
[15:54:52] <DaveMethvin> by the standards, event.bubbles should be true if the event is one that bubbles
[15:56:08] <DaveMethvin> hmm, it looks like we should be able to remove keyCode from props and do it in the code you have in that loop
[15:58:39] <DaveMethvin> and hey, why is "data" in props? that seems strange, is there a w3c data property?
[16:00:18] <rwaldron> i see what youre saying
[16:00:34] <rwaldron> i can move the exit condition to immediately follow that loop
[16:01:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think so, but then again there isn't much following tha tloop
[16:01:52] <DaveMethvin> i think there may be more to be saved by making sure that props doesn't have properties that could be moved into your mouse/key hooks
[16:02:08] <rwaldron> ok
[16:02:11] <rwaldron> i agree
[16:02:17] <rwaldron> so, ditch the loop?
[16:02:25] <rwaldron> i can find homes for a lot of this stuff
[16:03:09] <rwaldron> altKey, ctrlKey, keyCode, charCode
[16:03:12] <rwaldron> can move right?
[16:03:19] <DaveMethvin> i think at this point we've got ppl who expect that they can push on to jQuery.event.props so we need that list :(
[16:03:46] <DaveMethvin> according to the w3c the altKey etc are valid for mouse
[16:03:51] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-TextEvent-data
[16:03:59] <rwaldron> ef
[16:04:04] <rwaldron> i think then, this is it
[16:05:44] <DaveMethvin> here is the post that got me thinking about the early-exit thing: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/fix-is-slow
[16:08:44] <rwaldron> dave what about skipping properties that already exist?
[16:08:55] <rwaldron> do you think that would make a difference?
[16:09:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[16:09:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we might still be able to remove some of those props
[16:10:04] <DaveMethvin> but if we're skipping them in the loop we're just doing more in the loop
[16:10:18] <DaveMethvin> i don't see how anyone can use the event.data that fix copies, since we clobber it with the data that is passed by .bind()
[16:11:09] <DaveMethvin> hell i don't know what about a third of these are... prevValue???
[16:11:37] <rwaldron> mutation events
[16:11:44] <rwaldron> newValue prevValue
[16:11:51] <rwaldron> onpropertychange
[16:11:58] <DaveMethvin> wheelDelta is in there, is that only a mouse event?
[16:12:14] <rwaldron> wha
[16:12:14] <DaveMethvin> onpropertychange is ie-specific
[16:12:21] <rwaldron> http://books.google.com/books?id=GEQlVcVf_zkC&pg=PA543&lpg=PA543&dq=event+object+prevValue&source=bl&ots=itq4DJMRuO&sig=SGwGtpELyxMfRxMyozvTWZdmtK4&hl=en&ei=ncB7ToulBsn00gHsoOHlAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=event%20object%20prevValue&f=false
[16:12:30] <rwaldron> IE5
[16:12:52] <rwaldron> no need for that or newVal
[16:12:57] <rwaldron> newValue
[16:13:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah why are we copying those???
[16:13:07] <rwaldron> no idea
[16:13:13] <rwaldron> those def have to go
[16:13:27] <rwaldron> yeah, wheelDelta is mouse only
[16:13:41] <rwaldron> i can move that to mouse* events
[16:14:49] <DaveMethvin> now i'm starting to wonder how many of these are used
[16:15:06] <rwaldron> attrChange
[16:15:10] <rwaldron> again
[16:15:27] <rwaldron> so, onpropertychange (IE specific)
[16:15:46] <rwaldron> is the only event that uses newValue prevValue and attrChange
[16:16:04] <DaveMethvin> well there's 3 right there, plus 4 with wheeldelta
[16:16:22] <rwaldron> http://books.google.com/books?id=GEQlVcVf_zkC&lpg=PA532&ots=itq4DJMTvR&dq=event%20object%20attrChange&pg=PA530#v=onepage&q=event%20object%20attrChange&f=false
[16:19:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: the mutation events use those, but they all start with DOM
[16:19:34] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-mutationevents
[16:19:50] <DaveMethvin> dunno if ppl are using those properties directly in event or not
[16:20:16] <rwaldron> deprecated
[16:20:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah are the mutation events being supported going forward?
[16:20:35] <rwaldron> no
[16:20:42] <DaveMethvin> i thought so
[16:21:49] <rwaldron> button!
[16:21:59] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: looks like clientx/y are mouse only?
[16:22:00] <rwaldron> er
[16:22:01] <rwaldron> no
[16:22:10] <rwaldron> button is used for which
[16:22:21] <rwaldron> sure, I'll move them
[16:22:50] <DaveMethvin> also layerx/y don't appear in the w3c stds
[16:23:22] <rwaldron> layerX/Y is moz only i think?
[16:23:54] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6934
[16:24:54] <DaveMethvin> looks like we got them via this fix: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2911
[16:25:13] <DaveMethvin> but that was just copying the browser-specific values????
[16:25:38] <rwaldron> 3 years ago?
[16:25:54] <rwaldron> ugh...
[16:26:03] <DaveMethvin> seems like layerx/y got there when they shouldn't have
[16:26:19] <DaveMethvin> but it may also mean ie needs to be normalized to offsetx/y?
[16:26:19] <rwaldron> So, let's preserve them in the mouse* hooks?
[16:26:21] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[16:26:51] <rwaldron> offsetX/Y is non standard
[16:26:57] <rwaldron> i looked into that earlier today
[16:26:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah just figured that out :/
[16:27:18] <rwaldron> it requres the target element's left/top
[16:27:32] <rwaldron> i'm going to send all four to the mosue* hook
[16:27:35] <rwaldron> mouse*
[16:28:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess we have to if it goes back that far
[16:28:14] <DaveMethvin> damn this patch is getting larger
[16:28:28] <DaveMethvin> oh but wait
[16:28:56] <DaveMethvin> is there some way to temporarily push more stuff on the list to copy props?
[16:29:06] <DaveMethvin> that would save having to do it manually in the hook
[16:29:18] <DaveMethvin> and make the code smaller
[16:29:39] <rwaldron> er
[16:29:55] <rwaldron> we'd push, then splice off?
[16:29:58] <rwaldron> or something
[16:30:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah, something
[16:30:08] <rwaldron> why not just put a list and loop?
[16:30:08] <DaveMethvin> the something i haven't figured out
[16:30:12] <rwaldron> in the hook
[16:32:25] <DaveMethvin> so is the most common thing the hook needs to do is just add more props to the list?
[16:32:36] <rwaldron> yeah
[16:32:45] <DaveMethvin> i guess each of those hooks does a little bit more as well to normalize stuff
[16:32:56] <rwaldron> yep
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 			copy = "layerX layerY clientX clientY offsetX offsetY wheelDelta",
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 			i = -1;
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 			while ( i < copy.length ) {
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 				prop = copy[ ++i ];
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 				event[ prop ] = originalEvent[ prop ];
[16:33:18] <rwaldron> 			}
[16:33:24] <rwaldron> or something like that
[16:33:45] <DaveMethvin> we already have that loop in fix tho, it would be nice to reuse it
[16:34:11] <DaveMethvin> by getting the hook to tell fix that we want to add some stuff
[16:34:42] <rwaldron> i'm not sure how I'd do that
[16:34:58] <DaveMethvin> i  have an idea but i don't know if it would be a perf hit
[16:35:05] <DaveMethvin> lemme do a gist
[16:35:15] <rwaldron> propHooks was written to run after
[16:35:50] <rwaldron> i could make propHooks do some weird param hockey
[16:38:19] <rwaldron> what if...
[16:39:26] <rwaldron> var temp = jQuery.event.props.push.apply( null, propHook() )
[16:39:51] <rwaldron> propHook() <-- no params just returns a list of props to add to the list
[16:40:08] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: https://gist.github.com/1236358
[16:40:11] <rwaldron> oh god
[16:40:16] <rwaldron> i can't believe i did that
[16:40:23] <rwaldron> temp would be the length
[16:40:28] <rwaldron> ... tired
[16:40:41] <DaveMethvin> oh copy = copy.concat( ... )
[16:40:49] <DaveMethvin> it creates a new array
[16:40:57] <DaveMethvin> that's the perf part that worries me
[16:41:02] <rwaldron> yeah, so we basically just thought of the same thing
[16:41:05] <DaveMethvin> it might be cheaper to always copy them
[16:41:12] <rwaldron> based on your comments
[16:41:33] <rwaldron> 	// propHook can return an array of props to copy
[16:41:46] <DaveMethvin> oh and a local "copy" var compresses better than "this.props"
[16:41:57] <rwaldron> cool
[16:42:03] <DaveMethvin> i forgot to edit the interior of the loop
[16:42:15] <DaveMethvin> but anyway ... i dunno if the .concat is gonna kill the perf
[16:42:56] <DaveMethvin> but the path we're taking is gonna make this a big patch, b/c we are removing stuff from prop and doing explicit assignments in the hook
[16:43:15] <DaveMethvin> so defiitely need some way to add new props if possible
[16:44:46] <rwaldron> 		jQuery.event.propHooks[ name ] = function( event, original ) {
[16:44:47] <rwaldron> 			
[16:44:47] <rwaldron> 			if ( !event ) {
[16:44:47] <rwaldron> 				return "layerX layerY clientX clientY offsetX offsetY wheelDelta".split(" ");
[16:44:47] <rwaldron> 			}
[16:45:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah...we could even do the split on the fix side
[16:45:55] <DaveMethvin> saves a few more bytes
[16:45:59] <DaveMethvin> OH
[16:46:14] <DaveMethvin> if props were a string we could just concat/split it
[16:46:24] <DaveMethvin> but damn
[16:46:33] <DaveMethvin> i think props are semi-public as an array
[16:47:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm willing to break it tho
[16:47:06] <rwaldron> 		if ( propHook ) {
[16:47:06] <rwaldron> 			copy.push.apply( null, propHook() || [] );
[16:47:06] <rwaldron> 		}
[16:47:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:47:58] <DaveMethvin> maybe that's good enough, keeps props as an array
[16:48:15] <rwaldron> lastly...
[16:48:16] <rwaldron> 		for ( var i = copy.length, prop; i; ) {
[16:48:17] <rwaldron> 			prop = copy[ --i ];
[16:48:17] <rwaldron> 			event[ prop ] = originalEvent[ prop ];
[16:48:17] <rwaldron> 		}
[16:48:29] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if it would be faster making props a string and splitting it
[16:48:31] <DaveMethvin> but yeah
[16:48:37] <rwaldron> propHook() <-- no params can return just an array of shit to add
[16:48:40] <DaveMethvin> fix is gettin tiny
[16:49:03] <rwaldron> you think?
[16:49:16] <rwaldron> concat two strings and split em?
[16:49:16] <DaveMethvin> well we can pass event/originalEvent and it can mangle event AND return an array
[16:49:34] <rwaldron> the problem is that jQuery.event.props has been an array for a long time
[16:49:40] <rwaldron> we have docs that say it
[16:49:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know
[16:49:46] <DaveMethvin> where are those docs?
[16:49:52] <rwaldron> hell.. we have docs that say it's ok to push shit onto it
[16:50:02] <DaveMethvin> i think there's at least a forum post
[16:50:16] <DaveMethvin> but if we were going to break it we're offering something better here
[16:50:31] <DaveMethvin> most of the time ppl want to add a few props for specific events i think
[16:50:34] <rwaldron> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[16:50:37] <DaveMethvin> like dragenter
[16:50:39] <rwaldron> BIG section
[16:51:02] <DaveMethvin> ok
[16:51:04] <DaveMethvin> FUUUUUU
[16:51:07] <rwaldron> yep
[16:51:19] <DaveMethvin> so it's an array concat
[16:51:29] <rwaldron> wellll......
[16:51:34] <rwaldron> look what we have here
[16:51:49] <DaveMethvin> it had better be good news
[16:51:49] <rwaldron> wait nevermind
[16:52:16] <rwaldron> i was just thinking the list of clickable, blue event props was short
[16:52:20] <rwaldron> but then i scrolled up
[16:52:29] <rwaldron> lot's of shit documented
[16:52:42] <rwaldron> lots
[16:52:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah that big list
[16:52:56] <DaveMethvin> it's essentially just copy/pasta from the cod
[16:52:57] <rwaldron> ok
[16:52:59] <DaveMethvin> code
[16:53:06] <rwaldron> yeah
[16:53:07] <DaveMethvin> but
[16:53:22] <DaveMethvin> are some of those props even usable?
[16:53:36] <rwaldron> dunno
[16:53:43] <rwaldron> i'm running out of time
[16:53:52] <rwaldron> going out to dinner with rose in a few
[16:53:59] <DaveMethvin> oh then go, np
[16:54:03] <DaveMethvin> enjoy dinner
[16:54:09] <rwaldron> not yet
[16:54:11] <DaveMethvin> oh but before you go
[16:54:18] <rwaldron> shit
[16:54:23] <rwaldron> something is wrong
[16:54:32] <DaveMethvin> i have a q about a ticket
[16:54:42] <rwaldron> i was get this error earlier when i removed some props
[16:54:48] <rwaldron> event: bind/delegate bubbling, isDefaultPrevented (1, 0, 1)Rerun
[16:54:48] <rwaldron> Expected 2 assertions, but 0 were run
[16:55:19] <DaveMethvin> well put em back! :P
[16:55:23] <DaveMethvin> anyway, docs#10113
[16:55:25] <bot-t> anyway, [#10113] Set internal null flag for data-attrs that are removed (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10113
[16:55:38] <DaveMethvin> see my final comment there, can we close that as a needsdocs?
[16:55:58] <rwaldron> sure, that's cool
[16:56:09] <rwaldron> TBH, i immediately hated that ticket
[16:56:21] <DaveMethvin> don't worry about fix, i think you have some ideas to work on at some point
[16:56:26] <rwaldron> what ben suggested would require some serious bullshit piles of garbage code
[16:56:33] <rwaldron> for basically nothing
[16:56:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i am getting nazi about bytes
[16:56:41] <kswedberg> hmm. I wonder who added that bit about jQuery.event.props to the docs. :/
[16:56:55] <DaveMethvin> was it me?
[16:57:03] <rwaldron> oh snap hahahahaha
[16:57:08] <DaveMethvin> if it was me i hate me
[16:57:17] <DaveMethvin> i always hate the younger me
[16:57:27] <DaveMethvin> he was so damn handsome
[16:57:36] <DaveMethvin> but stupid
[16:58:12] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[16:58:21] <rwaldron> so, i dont know what to do
[16:58:22] <kswedberg> lol
[16:58:25] <rwaldron> fix is borked
[16:58:30] <rwaldron> the code makes sense
[16:58:33] <DaveMethvin> EAT
[16:58:40] <DaveMethvin> always makes me feel better
[16:58:48] <rwaldron> we're obviously doing some kind of retarded shit with properties elsewhere
[16:58:56] <DaveMethvin> honestly, it if wasn't for the shower and walking the dog i wouldn't ever have working code
[16:59:10] <rwaldron> yeah
[16:59:12] <rwaldron> i hear ya
[16:59:16] <DaveMethvin> just don't let rose know you're thinking of fix during dinner
[17:00:13] * rwaldron slaps self
[17:00:16] <rwaldron> this might be ok
[17:01:03] <rwaldron> OH HELL YEAH
[17:01:30] <rwaldron> copy.push.apply( null, propHook() || [] ); <-- NULL was causing exception
