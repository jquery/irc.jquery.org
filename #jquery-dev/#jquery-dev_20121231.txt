[05:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell snover I think I've had this IE issue before.
[05:48:02] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[07:54:09] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron mikesherov sooo, what say we make us a 2.0 today?
[07:54:27] <rwaldron> YAY!
[07:54:30] <mikesherov> oh man
[07:54:43] <DaveMethvin> i'm merging all the pulls locally
[07:54:44] <mikesherov> I was gearing up to land some 1.9 bugs today.
[07:54:57] <DaveMethvin> are they ie-only mikesherov?
[07:55:05] <mikesherov> no
[07:55:11] <mikesherov> we should be fine
[07:55:23] <mikesherov> just saying I won't be able to participate in the festivities :-\
[07:55:24] <DaveMethvin> if they're not major refactors we should be good
[07:55:31] <DaveMethvin> oh no prob on that
[07:55:42] <mikesherov> no prob on YOUR end!
[07:55:45] <DaveMethvin> i do have one question for you guys, and anyone else i missed
[07:56:03] <DaveMethvin> we are going to have two -git builds now
[07:56:29] <DaveMethvin> we could make the 2.0 the -git build and have a jquery1-git
[07:56:38] <DaveMethvin> but it seems like 1.9 will be more commonly used
[07:57:05] <DaveMethvin> so i'm thinking we might have a jquery1-git and a jquery2-git to be explicit about which branch
[07:57:20] <DaveMethvin> we can still have -git 
[07:57:33] <rwaldron> either is fine
[07:57:33] <DaveMethvin> what do you guys think?
[07:57:53] <rwaldron> I would leave 1.x
[07:58:01] <rwaldron> as jquery-git
[07:58:13] <DaveMethvin> we can make jquery-git as 1.9 for now and change it at some point
[07:58:16] <rwaldron> maybe for the next year?
[07:58:20] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:58:29] <DaveMethvin> as long as there is a 1 and 2 so ppl can choose what they need
[07:58:37] <rwaldron> agreed
[07:58:52] <rwaldron> i need to gab coffee
[07:58:53] <rwaldron> brb
[07:59:17] <DaveMethvin> i feel sorry for anyone with the commit log in their feeds, we're gonna land about 100 commits here :)
[08:01:03] <mikesherov> My twitter will blow up
[08:01:59] <rwaldron> nice
[08:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We're using jquery-ui-1-9-git.js for UI
[08:04:59] <DaveMethvin> since we'll only have two lines (1.x and 2.x) I think the single digit should work ... and i hate typing
[08:05:41] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: fat chance on offsetHeight returning a float
[08:05:49] <mikesherov> LOL
[08:06:12] <mikesherov> So, this is where I say, YOU WANT IT, YOU FIX IT
[08:06:27] <DaveMethvin> there ya go!
[08:06:30] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: why fat chance?
[08:06:39] <mikesherov> break the internet?
[08:06:44] <DaveMethvin> seems like a major behavior change thing, yeah
[08:07:32] <mikesherov> I suppose worse has happened in the world though in terms of breaking changes.
[08:08:03] <mikesherov> And if it gets no movement, I can always fix it in 2.0 when I ditch offsetWidth/offsetHeight
[08:18:29] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron, i'm going to land everything but the data changes, which we can do separately
[08:18:41] <DaveMethvin> so far we are at 29906
[08:19:03] <DaveMethvin> let me see if this still runs
[08:23:07] <DaveMethvin> okay, we've got some fails so I will need to look at these, but i need to run off for a dog walk
[08:24:41] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin do it
[08:24:47] <rwaldron> I haven;t left for coffee
[08:24:50] <rwaldron> seems like now is good
[08:24:55] <rwaldron> I'll be right back
[08:25:05] <rwaldron> and ready to dig in with you

[10:07:10] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron: do the change to the browserset and we can let it run to make sure it runs the right group

[10:07:30] <rwaldron> I can't find where this is supposed to be set
[10:07:39] <DaveMethvin> oh just a sec
[10:07:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah it wasn't clear to me
[10:07:53] <DaveMethvin> so i asked :D

[10:12:52] <rwaldron> I wonder if this will make the page look crazy
[10:12:56] <rwaldron> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery
[10:13:13] <DaveMethvin> i think ts can do it
[10:13:30] <rwaldron> I'm getting impatient
[10:13:36] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle set up a job for 1.8-stable so it should be possible
[10:13:38] <DaveMethvin> haha
[10:13:58] <DaveMethvin> stupid safari 5.1
[10:14:05] <DaveMethvin> hurry up and finish!
[10:15:09] <DaveMethvin> if this goes well, we'll hear the cry of a million rss feeds crying out in pain from 100 commits to master
[10:15:26] <DaveMethvin> but it will be so fun to see that list of deletes
[10:15:56] <rwaldron> well, i haven't landed any of the 2.0 stuff
[10:16:05] <rwaldron> just the version and browser set
[10:16:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, best to make sure it's runing the right browsers
[10:16:24] <DaveMethvin> that's the name that supposedly works
[10:16:30] <DaveMethvin> but i will believe it when i see it
[10:16:39] <rwaldron> yeah, I don't get it...
[10:16:46] <rwaldron> is this supposed to be running?
[10:17:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah it is running
[10:17:29] <DaveMethvin> there are some safari tests still running
[10:17:30] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:17:39] <DaveMethvin> this is why i have doubts about using ts for perf tests
[10:17:52] <rwaldron> mikesherov's changes to attributes created a conflict
[10:18:00] <rwaldron> I'm just going to resolve it on my end
[10:18:02] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:18:21] <DaveMethvin> i'll be back in about 5 minutes
[10:23:57] <DaveMethvin> ok back
[10:25:13] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, so when this IE8 is done, it _should_ run the next set with just "popular-no-old-ie"
[10:25:16] <rwaldron> right?

[10:50:27] <DaveMethvin> looking good so far rwaldron http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2113
[10:55:23] <rwaldron> IE 10
[10:56:37] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i can look at that one
[10:56:43] <rwaldron> attributes
[10:56:50] <DaveMethvin> i thought i saw it on my local run as well with ie9
[10:56:56] <DaveMethvin> so let's see if swarmy agrees
[10:57:15] <DaveMethvin> oh did you just reset that?
[10:57:22] <rwaldron> I only tested in one browser locally, my assumption being that testswarm would do this for me :)
[10:57:27] <rwaldron> i did nothing
[10:57:33] <DaveMethvin> i think we're doing pretty well
[10:57:44] <rwaldron> weeeird
[10:57:49] <DaveMethvin> oh that's right, swarm automatically reruns failed tests
[10:57:58] <DaveMethvin> since they're so flakey!
[10:58:02] <DaveMethvin> ok yeah ie9 too
[10:58:11] <rwaldron> looks like those 3 attr fails in IE9, 10
[10:58:11] <DaveMethvin> i think we're doing pretty well
[10:58:13] <rwaldron> woo!
[10:58:28] <DaveMethvin> i can look at that
[11:07:53] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i fixed it, it was simply a matter of looking for the 'interactive' script and attaching the results of its function call to it
[11:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> snover: I was thinking of this: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/js/scripts.js#L122
[11:10:35] <snover> looks like the same behaviour

[15:16:01] <doesallmagic> waldron.rick: Only splice from internal arrays when item actually exists.
[17:54:23] <DaveMethvin> .
[17:55:30] <DaveMethvin> My new year's resolution for 2102 was to have a successful build, and I made it with like 4 hours to spare!
[18:06:54] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm in hour 4 with a problem
[18:07:07] <DaveMethvin> whatsup?
[18:07:07] <rwaldron> an intermittent "Permission Denied" error in the IEs
[18:07:13] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i saw that
[18:07:17] <DaveMethvin> and it's in the focus test?
[18:07:31] <rwaldron> that Ive traced back to this.owners.indexOf( owner )
[18:07:47] <rwaldron> I think when owner is from another frame
[18:07:52] <rwaldron> there are issues...
[18:07:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would make sense i guess
[18:08:01] <rwaldron> but he's the weirdest part.
[18:08:21] <rwaldron> it's only when 'protection' is enabled in IE
[18:08:31] <DaveMethvin> damn condoms
[18:08:52] <DaveMethvin> [ ] Go bareback
[18:09:04] <DaveMethvin> [x] Go bareback
[18:09:10] <DaveMethvin> THEREIFIXEDIT
[18:09:39] <DaveMethvin> ironic, it's in the Tools, Options i guess
[18:10:24] <rwaldron> yeah, I got the tests to pass by unchecking that
[18:10:39] <rwaldron> the worst part...
[18:10:50] <rwaldron> you can run those test alone
[18:10:53] <rwaldron> and they pass
[18:11:28] <DaveMethvin> but not in testswarm?
[18:12:06] <rwaldron> nope
[18:12:21] <rwaldron> when they run in the suite, they fail
[18:12:30] <rwaldron> when run alone, they pass
[18:12:39] <DaveMethvin> the focus tests are so much of a pain
[18:12:52] <DaveMethvin> it's b/c IE has that stupid async focus
[18:13:48] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron which option makes it work? it it in tools/options/advanced?
[18:14:24] <rwaldron> Under the security tab
[18:14:33] <rwaldron> uncheck "Enable Protected Mode"
[18:15:42] <DaveMethvin> just looking at the protected mode docs
[18:15:47] <DaveMethvin> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250462(v=vs.85).aspx
[18:17:14] <DaveMethvin> bla bla bla bullshit bullshit
[18:17:18] <rwaldron> yeah
[18:18:05] <DaveMethvin> well, judging by where it happened i have to guess it is dealing with some other window being focused
[18:18:14] <rwaldron> Yeah
[18:18:16] <DaveMethvin> that is not the current frame's window
[18:18:38] <DaveMethvin> so how do we shut it up :D
[18:19:01] <rwaldron> I'm working through it
[18:19:12] <rwaldron> awful try/catch
[18:19:37] <DaveMethvin> "Understanding Windows Vista's Integrity Mechanism"  no thanks i'd rather understand how my wife thinks, it would be EASIER 
[18:19:53] <rwaldron> for real.
[18:20:59] <DaveMethvin> so if it errored out would you just bail from the set and do nothing"
[18:21:00] <DaveMethvin> ?
[18:21:12] <rwaldron> I tried that
[18:21:24] <rwaldron> but then it fails a bunch of other tests
[18:21:38] <rwaldron> like, we still need to get the data for that node
[18:22:03] <DaveMethvin> well. that sucks.
[18:23:05] <DaveMethvin> so exactly what is owner when this fails?
[18:23:35] <rwaldron> a node from somewhere
[18:23:44] <rwaldron> its so hard to grok what the fuck IE is doing
[18:23:48] <rwaldron> F12 tools are shit
[18:25:47] <DaveMethvin> so let me look at this ... ok, it's the focus-blur order test, right?
[18:26:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see it here
[18:27:06] <DaveMethvin> wow it takes a while to fail
[18:27:21] * rwaldron nods
[18:28:14] <DaveMethvin> well i think this is pretty good 
[18:28:23] <DaveMethvin> i know we can beat this one
[18:28:26] <DaveMethvin> next year!
[18:28:29] <rwaldron> hahaha
[18:28:42] <rwaldron> ok, well I just wanted to make sure I had covered this with you
[18:28:53] <rwaldron> I have some ideas about how to slay this thing
[18:29:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's just one little thing and i bet we can figure it out
[18:29:43] <DaveMethvin> these focus things are SUCH a pain no matter waht
[18:29:56] <DaveMethvin> but if we're having it in unit tests i bet other people will see it too
[18:30:05] <rwaldron> right
[18:30:30] <DaveMethvin> the thing i fear about using ES5 features is they are so lightly tested on just about every browser
[18:30:42] <DaveMethvin> since it's lowest common denominator on so much code
[18:30:48] <DaveMethvin> so we may be dealing with that
[18:31:19] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, take the rest of the year off and we can work on this later
[18:33:10] <rwaldron> ES5 features?
[18:33:14] <rwaldron> like... indexOf?
[18:33:15] <rwaldron> hahaha
[18:36:23] <DaveMethvin> does this debugger even WORK?
[18:36:24] <bot-t> (3 hours 25 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell DaveMethvin i just pushed a fix, should be fine in IE now, I'll be back shortly and will check in on it
[18:36:38] <DaveMethvin> oh thanks bot-t /sarcasm
[18:38:32] <rwaldron> haha
[18:38:45] <rwaldron> no i dont think it does
[18:38:49] <DaveMethvin> HOW IS THIS NOT HITTING A BREAKPOINT!
[18:38:52] <rwaldron> does not
[18:38:58] <rwaldron> yeah...
[18:39:01] <DaveMethvin> so strange
[18:39:04] <rwaldron> i've been in this hell as well.
[18:39:15] <DaveMethvin> i'm putting it at the top of that test in the expect()
[18:39:24] <DaveMethvin> and it somehow skips???
[18:39:33] * rwaldron shrugs
[18:39:50] <rwaldron> this issue should also only appear when the frame is mis-matched domain
[18:39:56] <rwaldron> (port, sub domain etc)
[18:40:03] <rwaldron> no reason for it appear like this
[18:40:07] <rwaldron> to*
[20:12:03] <ralphholzmann> will jqui ever be amd-ified?
