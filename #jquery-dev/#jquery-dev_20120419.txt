[05:29:04] <gibson042> .
[05:47:19] <jzaefferer> ?tell rwaldron qunitjs.com repo got a bunch of content update. Code blocks are rendered properly, tutorial is now cookbook and has somewhat sane markup. There's a grunt task for exporting documents without layout for the wordpress import, that one is not quite done
[05:47:20] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[05:47:51] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ - been working on that this morning
[05:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[05:51:34] <jzaefferer> Once the export is complete, the only step remaining is to import into Wordpress
[05:51:51] <jzaefferer> Once node-wordpress is updated to use the xml-rcp API, that should be pretty easy to do
[05:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Why did core decide to branch for 1.8pre instead of branching for 1.7?
[06:25:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: there was some debate about which would be the branch, that's what we settled on
[06:25:13] <DaveMethvin> is there a big advantage to one way or the other?
[06:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> Having main development occur in master seems to most obvious.
[06:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also avoids needing to follow differnet branches just to keep up with latest.
[06:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of PRs against master instead of 1.8pre from the community.
[06:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> I also assume that when 1.8 is ready for release and you merge 1.8pre into master you might have to resolve a lot of conflicts.
[06:34:24] <DaveMethvin> we're not doing much on master right now ... i don't think it's likely we'll release a 1.7.3 at this point
[06:34:29] <DaveMethvin> so i tend to agree
[06:34:49] <DaveMethvin> it hasn't been much of a problem for me though
[06:35:16] <DaveMethvin> i just commit to 1.8pre, the only unmerged commit from master is a typo fix, and i put it there so I wouldn't clobber master with a push :)
[06:47:56] <gnarf> figures scott_gonzalez would have the good reasons to do it the way UI did it
[06:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:49:05] <gnarf> ?tell rwaldron gratz btw https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/jquery-board-public/oq57aBej3Ps !!!
[06:49:06] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[06:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> The naming of 1-8-stable vs. 1.8stable is from wycats though.
[06:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> He said branches should be instantly distinguishable from tags, it made since so I went with it.
[06:51:02] <nacin> gnarf: DaveMethvin: I'm going to be a pain and ask a question about the jQuery Foundation
[06:51:38] <gnarf> yeah?
[06:51:39] <nacin> according to http://jquery.org/team/, a 2/3 vote is required to add a new member, so you actually need 8 votes
[06:51:59] <gnarf> i was thinking 7
[06:52:02] <nacin> while I was setting up these sites I figured I would read them :-)
[06:52:18] <nacin> either way, the email says 6. 2/3 of 11 is 7.3~
[06:53:08] <DaveMethvin> yes you are right nacin
[06:53:15] <DaveMethvin> i messed up the boilerplate for the votes
[06:53:48] <DaveMethvin> i was planning to go back when the 48 hours passed and confirm that they passed according to the real rules
[06:54:45] <nacin> I was just curious. not trying to derail rwaldron :-)
[06:54:57] <DaveMethvin> he's already off the rails, too late
[06:55:05] <gnarf> bbiab
[06:55:23] <DaveMethvin> oh darn rwaldron isn't here to get that zinger
[06:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> I actually think the number of votes is lower for rwaldron.
[06:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of conflicts of interest :-)
[06:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> Adam, Richard, and Dan are conflicted. 11 -3 = 8, 2/3 of 8 = 5.28, 6 votes to pass
[06:58:24] <DaveMethvin> right, nearly every vote has a different number for different reasons this time
[06:58:33] <DaveMethvin> Leah and Yehuda can't vote for each other
[06:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> And nobody can vote for themselves.
[06:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> Only my vote was correct :-P
[06:59:24] <DaveMethvin> it will take half an hour to analyze and describe all the conflicts
[06:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, I'd wait for you to send your out and then figure out what's wrong before sending mine :-)
[06:59:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah so all your votes are invalid and I rule the jQuery Foundation :D
[06:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:02:51] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez i thought your idea for an AMD stub loader was great
[07:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[07:03:18] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell if you're being serious or trolling me right now...
[07:04:00] <DaveMethvin> hey, it would make the amd complainers go away, we would support amd! :D
[07:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand what the actual complaint is.
[07:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> Are they using AMD locally?
[07:04:35] <DaveMethvin> i think they want AMD built into jQuery
[07:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a reason they can't just use r.js?
[07:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery doesn't even have dependencies.
[07:05:02] <DaveMethvin> no we don't but they do
[07:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> And they don't want to use plugins?
[07:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Or want to use something besides r.js?
[07:05:31] <DaveMethvin> exactly, the bane of our existence
[07:05:59] <DaveMethvin> really let me find one of the threads, it's incredible
[07:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually trying to troll core with the AMD stub loader thinking that it would get the heat off of UI and core would never approve it :-P
[07:06:29] <DaveMethvin> oh no i'm just joking
[07:06:41] <DaveMethvin> but it's incredible how ppl always want crap built in
[07:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh good; you seriously had me worried.
[07:07:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm doing an analysis on southwest.com right now, and they are using CJS
[07:07:18] <DaveMethvin> AMD's brother
[07:07:29] <DaveMethvin> and it is making their site a real mess performance wise
[07:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> But my plan even had a back door. Even if core added it, we couldn't use it for years since we don't track against latest :-P
[07:07:53] <DaveMethvin> lol but you could shim it in yourself
[07:08:00] <DaveMethvin> gotta use those advanced features
[07:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, my argument is that we can't shim it ourselves because we have too many files that don't have other UI dependencies.
[07:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> ui.core, ui.position, ui.widget, effects.core
[07:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to shim in each one.
[07:08:43] <DaveMethvin> sure, you just need ui.amd
[07:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA
[07:09:02] <DaveMethvin> any time you need a solution, come to me
[07:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> That would be really sad.
[07:09:14] <DaveMethvin> if you need a solution real bad, i have a real bad solution
[07:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> People actually using AMD would have files like ui.core saying they depend on ui.amd and ui.amd wouldn't work with AMD :-P
[07:10:01] <DaveMethvin> honestly i am not sure what makes amd so attractive
[07:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not actually sure what happens if you loop a noop script using AMD.
[07:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it would die.
[07:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> s/loop/load/
[07:10:50] <DaveMethvin> it never has made sense to me, in most cases a site knows its dependencies in advance and can load the code quicker as a single file
[07:10:58] <DaveMethvin> i can see it being useful for node perhaps
[07:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, node has a history of saying no to ADM.
[07:11:45] <DaveMethvin> but for a production web site it just makes things slower, more requests
[07:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> That's because people are using it wrong.
[07:12:08] <DaveMethvin> i was working on a project that used AMD, and when i checked at least half their dependency lists were too big
[07:12:17] <DaveMethvin> so like they'd declare a dep on underscore and not use it
[07:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> Even worse is the opposite. They don't declare dependencies they actually have.
[07:12:49] <scott_gonzalez> And it happens to work because the modules are exposing globals.
[07:12:54] <DaveMethvin> right and it manages to work b/c of some other ... yeah
[07:26:58] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: this looks interesting: http://www.symbolhound.com/ Might be useful, now that google code search is dead.
[07:27:57] <addyosmani> seems to work alright kswedberg http://www.symbolhound.com/codesearch/?q=%24.Callbacks&lang=JavaScript
[07:29:09] <kswedberg> lot of people using $.Callbacks! ;)
[07:29:48] <addyosmani> oh, absolutely!
[07:30:55] <addyosmani> btw, is anyone else working on the 'jquery api todo' list?
[07:31:19] <kswedberg> doesn't look like it. :(
[07:31:19] <addyosmani> I was going to leave it be to focus on the triage #needsdocs, but didn't know if we cared about which took priority.
[07:31:35] <addyosmani> that's cool.
[07:31:46] <addyosmani> I can continue going through the doc. They need to be eventually addressed anyway.
[07:32:10] <kswedberg> I'd say, as long as you're getting stuff done, don't worry too much about priority. (I'm a beggar, so I can be a chooser)
[07:32:14] <addyosmani> lol
[07:32:17] <addyosmani> sounds good to me ; )
[07:33:37] <kswedberg> Was also thinking about how we should manage docs issues now that we have github.com/jquery/api.query.com/ all set up. Seems like the github issue tracker would work well for this and keep everything all in one place.
[07:34:11] <addyosmani> I would *love* if we could just use the issue tracker for them
[07:34:53] <kswedberg> cool. let's do it, then. unless someone else objects.
[07:35:10] <addyosmani> If you need help migrating issues over, just let me know. Can prolly help after work.
[07:35:15] <kswedberg> I can move the remaining todo items from that google spreadsheet into the issue tracker
[07:35:51] <kswedberg> and replace the current documentation report form on the api site with a link to said issue tracker.
[07:35:54] <addyosmani> I think that would make sense
[07:36:40] <kswedberg> thx addyosmani! I think I can handle, but will holler if I need someone to bail me out. :)
[07:39:23] <gnarf> what about needsdocs tickets on core trac
[07:39:38] <addyosmani> I think those should be moved over too.
[07:39:56] <addyosmani> so we have a singular location to discuss/work from.
[07:40:01] <addyosmani> but someone might disagree
[07:40:07] <gnarf> not me
[07:43:53] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 1 new commit to 1.8pre: http://git.io/pTWpmA

[07:45:56] <rwaldron> jzaefferer nice, let me update
[08:00:04] <kswedberg> addyosmani: I agree on moving needsdocs over. you wanna handle that, and I'll do the google spreadsheet + replacing api form with link?
[08:01:49] <addyosmani> sounds good!
[08:02:44] <rwaldron> ?tell jzaefferer looks great! I've fixed a few of the code examples where I previously had &lt;div&gt; etc.

[09:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> That should be Copyright 2012 jQuery Foundation
[09:25:14] <rwaldron> jzaefferer is there an automated process for updating qunitjs.com?
[09:25:37] <rwaldron> pushed some changes per feedback from ben_alman, danheberden, addyosmani and scott_gonzalez
[09:25:40] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: nope
[09:25:45] <rwaldron> nuts
[09:25:53] <danheberden> 'n bolts
[09:26:08] <rwaldron> jzaefferer should I just update web-qunitjs-com manually?
[09:26:38] <rwaldron> (with the results of a rendered docpad?)
[09:26:43] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: I'm updating. If we need to keep that repo around longer, I can hand that over
[09:27:35] <rwaldron> I have push/pull on web-qunitjs-com
[09:27:48] <rwaldron> so i dont need to bug you
[09:27:49] <rwaldron> :)
[09:27:54] <addyosmani> thanks rwaldron!
[09:28:06] <rwaldron> I'm just making sure I have this correct
[09:28:14] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: well, I've initialized a git repo inside the out folder
[09:28:22] <jzaefferer> just git-pulled in the parent folder
[09:28:27] <jzaefferer> then ran docpad generate
[09:28:34] <jzaefferer> then commited and pushed changes in the out folder
[09:28:41] <jzaefferer> where the remote is web-qunitjs-com
[09:28:52] <rwaldron> nice
[09:29:20] <danheberden> which needs to get renamed to qunitjs.com one of these days
[09:29:46] <rwaldron> jzaefferer i can honestly say I've never done that before
[09:29:48] <rwaldron> neat!
[09:29:54] <jzaefferer> for style changes, we need to keep in mind that those need to land upstream in https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/
[09:30:09] <rwaldron> ok
[09:30:14] <jzaefferer> danheberden: or rather, we'll just delete it, once we can deploy those files to the wordpress multi site
[09:30:15] <rwaldron> there is only one new thing
[09:30:55] <danheberden> jzaefferer wat? where would the content live/be-edited?
[09:32:41] <jzaefferer> danheberden: where it should be: http://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com
[09:33:12] <jzaefferer> but I'll delete this now: https://github.com/jquery/web-qunitjs-com-source
[09:33:42] <danheberden> oh didn't know there were two
[09:42:33] <rwaldron> kswedberg landed.
[09:44:30] <rwaldron> danheberden 2 col, better now? http://qunitjs.com/cookbook.html

[09:44:38] <rwaldron> also.. lunchtime.
[09:45:48] <danheberden> rwaldron ya easier on the eyes for sure
[10:46:15] <kswedberg> rwaldron: yay! thanks!
[15:57:24] <paul_irish> Krinkle: bro
[15:57:24] <bot-t> (20 mins 50 secs ago) <tbranyen> tell paul_irish can you please fix the link to me on here, <3s forever: http://paulirish.com/demo/multi
[15:57:25] <paul_irish> can you connect me to a developer behind the mobile wikipedia site
[15:57:37] <Krinkle> I can
[15:57:41] <Krinkle> Anything in particular?
[15:58:11] <Krinkle> or skip me, #wikimedia-dev <tfinc>
[15:58:32] <paul_irish> boom
[15:58:37] <Krinkle> He should be in the office (I am not) considering the time it is in SF.
[15:59:02] <Krinkle> if you can't reach him lemme know, I'll find someone else :)
[15:59:35] <paul_irish> boom awesome. that's precisely the due.
[15:59:36] <paul_irish> dude
[15:59:53] <paul_irish> my buddy <smus> is gonna talk to him about Chrome on Android compat
[15:59:54] <paul_irish> thxxx
[16:00:04] <Krinkle> I'm not sure I follow, you already knew him?
[16:00:09] <Krinkle> or just forgot the name?
[16:00:20] <paul_irish> ah, smus and tfinc had met. was tryign to refind him
[16:00:32] <Krinkle> ok, np :) glad I could help
[16:01:53] <Krinkle> Last year the hacked up ruby-powered mobile gateway / proxy  was dismantled in favor of a solution that is actually native in the MediaWiki software (project: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MobileFrontend, the actual plugin for MediaWiki, currently live on m.*.wiki*.org: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend )
[16:02:36] <Krinkle> the ruby gateway was sort of a html sniffer trying to somehow construct a mobile friendly page, but it was awful really
[16:02:47] <Krinkle> it should be a lot better now, not sure if it was visually noticable
[16:06:12] <gf3> Krinkle: cool
[16:06:54] <Krinkle> and now that it is a plugin, any mediawiki site can install it, which was another big goal (to have it not be some hacked up thing on wikimedia's servers)
[16:08:17] <gf3> Krinkle: I suppose it includes the styling too?
[16:08:26] <Krinkle> Yes
[16:08:33] <gf3> (Playing with the mobile version on my Android)
[16:09:30] <Krinkle> It is not a separate installation of MediaWiki. It is using the same install that all the other domains use, but the plugin will detect the user agent and trigger the 'mobile' skin. It is just a different skin for the same content.
[16:10:28] <Krinkle> right now it is not making use of MediaWiki's core resource loader framework, which is somewhat of a debate currently.
[16:11:29] <Krinkle> the mediawiki resource loader is a cool framework that dynamically re-minified/concatenates stuff based on when files were last modified and does so all on the fly. And it makes good combinations of modules that are always used to gather, so doesn't pump everything in 1 file so that there is less cache fragmentation
[16:11:50] <Krinkle> but because that framework also has a l client side, which uses jquery, they decided for now to circumvent it with a build script to minify the js by hand
[16:12:21] <Krinkle> because jquery apparently crashes some older mobile devices.
[16:12:35] <Krinkle> I can't find the exact support for jquery core right now though, is that tracked anywhere ?
[16:12:45] <Krinkle> for mobile browsers that is
[16:12:47] <gf3> Yikes
[16:12:50] <gf3> JQ or JQM?
[16:12:56] <Krinkle> jQuery core
[16:13:42] <gf3> I wouldn't imagine that the mobile version requires too much JS, is JQ even really required at all?
[16:14:14] <Krinkle> Well, yes/no. MediaWiki core uses jquery in various places. We use it and plugins for it quite a lot.
[16:14:43] <Krinkle> Right now it reinvents a lot of stuff jQuery does, in a way that is a little broader supported but also lot closer to vanilla javascript. So right now they check server side whether the mobile device supports js at and either deliver version A or version B
[16:15:30] <Krinkle> I suggested (which they are OK with last I checked, just not implemented yet) to move that bar a little bit up from "supports js" to "supports jQuery level js", and server version A (the non js version) also to less-capable js browsers.
[16:16:25] <Krinkle> once that happens, a lot of core features will automagically be available in mobile such as autocompletion, collapsibility and what not.
[16:16:54] <gf3> Cool, makes sense
[16:17:51] <Krinkle> right now it just overloads the php skin class method that outputs the <head> and bottom of <body> with empty strings, basically.
[16:18:16] <Krinkle> to filter out the core js framework :D
[16:45:16] <jaubourg> that's funny
[16:45:26] <jaubourg> I installed grunt globally using npm on windows
[16:45:43] <jaubourg> and why I type "grunt", it opens grunt.js in a text editor
[16:45:51] <jaubourg> dunno if that's by design
[16:50:41] <gf3> jaubourg: Do you dev full time on Windows?
[16:51:38] <jaubourg> gf3: sadly yes
[16:51:45] <jaubourg> and I use Eclipse to boot
[16:52:07] <jaubourg> so, you need to type grunt.cmd
[16:52:29] <gf3> jaubourg: Just curious
[16:52:40] <jaubourg> but now it asks for grunt-compare-size that I installed globally already
[16:52:45] <gf3> jaubourg: I want to try my hand at some Windows dev, it has been a while
[16:53:07] <jaubourg> oh, I don't develop FOR windows, just ON windows
[16:53:13] <jaubourg> or under rather
[16:55:32] <gf3> Right right, but for me to develop for windows I will likely have to develop on windows
[16:55:35] <jaubourg> ?tell rwaldron so, 1.8 grunt build system complains about grunt-compare-size not being installed... I install it using npm globally... then it still complains. I'm under windows.
[16:55:35] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[17:33:48] <jaubourg> rwaldron: look up
[17:34:00] <jaubourg> or rather, talk
[18:02:40] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to 1.8pre: http://git.io/p3qvug
[18:02:40] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Fixes #8205. Mitigates memory usage by recycling jsonp callback names the safest possible way (no kittens were harmed in the making of this). Doesn't even try to delete window properties (would necessitate a try/catch for IE which makes the cost in size prohibitive). Unit tests added. - jaubourg
