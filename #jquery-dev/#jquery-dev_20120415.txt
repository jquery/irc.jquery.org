[10:40:36] <mikesherov> .
[10:40:45] <mikesherov> ajpiano: you just trolled that thread hard
[10:41:01] <ajpiano> lol
[10:41:03] <ajpiano> that's what he said!!
[10:56:25] <mikesherov> I got way too caught up in the bike-shedding
[11:55:29] <ajpiano> mikesherov: you there
[11:55:36] <mikesherov> yo
[11:56:12] <ajpiano> what are you doing on apr 26th
[11:56:40] <ajpiano> http://www.jqnyc.com/events/59902312/
[11:56:59] <mikesherov> I'm there
[11:57:00] <ajpiano> milan asked if i wanted to do an "experts" panel or whatnot after
[11:57:01] <mikesherov> nice
[11:57:07] <ajpiano> and i said i'd ask if you wanted to join in
[11:57:17] <mikesherov> I definitely want to join in
[11:57:25] <ajpiano> sweeeet, i'll pass it along
[11:58:11] <mikesherov> I'm not sure if I'm an expert on debugging or not, but I'd be glad to pretend to be one :-P
[11:58:26] <ajpiano> haha
[11:58:32] <ajpiano> i think it's just generally gonna be jquery
[11:58:35] <wycats_> does running the core unit tests really require PHP?
[11:58:50] <ajpiano> yes
[11:58:54] <wycats_> really?
[11:58:57] <ajpiano> yep
[11:59:00] <wycats_> are you sure?
[11:59:04] <wycats_> I don't believe it
[11:59:13] <wycats_> it's too ridiculous for me to take seriously :P
[11:59:20] <wycats_> I am downloading MAMP :P
[11:59:29] <mikesherov> wycats_: AJAX requires it
[11:59:52] <mikesherov> wycats_: also, I introduced it so I could test jQuery as a single file
[12:00:19] <wycats_> mikesherov: I am no node guy, but the build already requires node
[12:00:20] <wycats_> sooooo
[12:00:29] <mikesherov> wycats_: unfortunately, we're not fully on grunt yet, which theoretically would create the single file using other means first before running the tests
[12:01:29] <mikesherov> actually, the build requires node, but testing doesn't
[12:01:45] <mikesherov> you should be able to make a change, and test your change without building
[12:01:57] <mikesherov> at least that's how it was explained to me :-P
[12:02:07] <wycats_> the build requires node, but tests require php
[12:02:16] <wycats_> seems good bro
[12:02:30] <mikesherov> I'm personally all for "build-then-test" each time.
[12:02:44] <mikesherov> Come now, no need to be snarky.
[12:02:47] <wycats_> mikesherov: so grunt is cool, but it's not the only way to achieve this goal (historically)
[12:02:54] <mikesherov> oh, of course!
[12:02:55] <wycats_> mikesherov: there's always a need to be snarky :P :P :P
[12:03:39] <mikesherov> wycats_: I had done some work for the unit tests so that I could test a single file version of jQuery. I'm all for porting it all to node
[12:03:39] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  You don't need MAMP. Just download PHP 5.4 and run php -S localhost:8000 in the jQuery folder ;)
[12:03:52] <wycats_> link to the download?
[12:04:06] * wycats_ is a PHP noob
[12:04:23] <mikesherov> But rwaldron had already started on the grunt work, so he put a freeze on more changes to the test suite
[12:04:31] <wycats_> seems ok
[12:04:51] <wycats_> just doesn't seem great that the test suite is non-trivial to run
[12:04:59] <mikesherov> Agreed
[12:05:00] <sindresorhus_> wycats_: Mac Lion?
[12:05:08] <wycats_> sindresorhus: my mac has 5.3.8
[12:05:09] <wycats_> not 5.4
[12:05:19] <mikesherov> wycats_: the tests needed PHP to run the AJAX tests for a very long time
[12:05:27] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  http://www.hirmet.com/mac-os-x-lion-upgrade-to-php-5-4
[12:05:35] <mikesherov> just no one noticed because the test suite excludes those tests if you don't have PHP
[12:05:37] <wycats_> mikesherov: yeah, but as I rarely work on Ajax, it was never an issue for me before ;)
[12:05:42] <wycats_> I always worked on manipulation
[12:06:00] <ajpiano> wycats_ takes a machiavellian approach to jquery development
[12:06:02] <ajpiano> :x
[12:06:20] <mikesherov> right, and I always worked on css, and then I worked on the .ready event, and realized I needed an async download of jQuery as a single file
[12:06:30] <wycats_> why has nobody created brew install php?
[12:06:37] <mikesherov> and I realized that I wanted to make sure my code didn't screw around with AJAX
[12:06:43] <wycats_> "Download and unpack the PHP source archive"
[12:06:49] <wycats_> yuno link?
[12:06:52] <mikesherov> and I realized that if I only tested my tests, I wouldn't know if I had a regression :-P
[12:07:03] <wycats_> c
[12:07:39] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  https://www.google.no/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ix=teb&ie=UTF-8#hl=no&sclient=psy-ab&q=homebrew%20php%205.4&oq=&aq=&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=135cf5f049586257&ix=teb&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1920&bih=1079
[12:08:59] <mikesherov> wycats_: I was at your ember talk on Thursday. Super impressed with it.
[12:09:04] <wycats_> mikesherov: nice!
[12:09:12] <wycats_> all of our build setup is written in Ruby :P :P :P
[12:09:24] <wycats_> so we have things like all in one file, automatic rebuild, etc.
[12:09:36] <wycats_> I'm glad that grunt provides a low-barrier way for more JS projects to do the same
[12:09:38] <mikesherov> yeah, will be nice to get there with jQuery
[12:10:16] <mikesherov> for the time being, we'll manage with MAMP and LAMP
[12:10:23] <wycats_> https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/Assetfile
[12:10:24] <wycats_> hehe
[12:11:58] <mikesherov> wycats_: the secret is that you can still run the jQUery tests without PHP
[12:12:11] <mikesherov> it's just that some of the tests won't run.
[12:12:23] <wycats_> mikesherov: it was halting for me
[12:12:28] <wycats_> not sure why
[12:12:35] <mikesherov> right, it gives you a failing test
[12:12:53] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  PHP 5.4 with homebrew:
[12:12:53] <mikesherov> just ignore that failing test and you're fine :-)
[12:12:53] <sindresorhus_> brew install https://raw.github.com/gist/1957031/c30642d370218f3479d8b21ccc9e8209724585d5/php.rb
[12:13:28] <wycats_> seems good :)
[12:13:36] <wycats_> scumbag homebrew: yuno import
[12:26:52] <wycats_> Error: Failed executing: make
[12:27:20] <wycats_> seems bad
[12:27:22] <wycats_> I'll try again
[12:27:36] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  Hmm, it worked for me...
[12:28:05] <wycats_> I'm sure ;)
[12:28:09] <wycats_> I'm trying again
[12:30:27] <wycats_> ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
[12:31:58] <mikesherov> wycats_: MAMP didn't work for you?
[12:32:59] <wycats_> it was taking too long to download on the shitty hotel wifi
[12:33:22] <wycats_> I'll try compiling manually
[12:33:53] <mikesherov> or you can skip using MAMP and just do your thing without PHP
[12:34:27] <wycats_> seems ok
[12:37:26] <sindresorhus_> wycats_:  You might have better luck with this one though: https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php
[12:37:26] <sindresorhus_> brew install --devel https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php.git
[12:37:26] <sindresorhus_> Haven't tried it though
[12:38:06] <wycats_> I'm compiling manually
[12:38:13] <wycats_> following http://www.hirmet.com/mac-os-x-lion-upgrade-to-php-5-4
[12:39:01] <sindresorhus_> k
[12:39:17] <wycats_> zomg
[12:39:18] <wycats_> $ php -v
[12:39:19] <wycats_> PHP 5.4.0 (cli) (built: Apr 15 2012 15:38:50)
[12:39:25] <sindresorhus_> :D
[12:40:05] <sindresorhus_> php -S localhost:8000 and enjoy
[12:40:30] <wycats_> hm I am getting failures still
[12:40:58] <wycats_> it's blocking on queues
[12:48:53] <wycats_> mikesherov: I'm using php -S and it seems to be screwing up get()
[12:49:07] <wycats_> the tests are expecting XML back, but I'm seeing a string
[12:49:39] <mikesherov> Yeah, not sure about how that works... that's jaubourg's department
[12:50:37] <wycats_> I see
[12:50:42] <mikesherov> I think you'd need port 80 though
[12:50:48] <mikesherov> not port 8000
[12:50:57] <wycats_> it seems bad that we're enlisting Ajax to test isXMLDoc
[12:51:09] <mikesherov> seems that way!
[12:52:25] <wycats_> port 80 didn't fix it
[12:54:18] <wycats_> I bet Apache knows to serve xml files as text/xml
[12:54:22] <wycats_> but php -S does not
[12:55:56] <mikesherov> That would make sense
