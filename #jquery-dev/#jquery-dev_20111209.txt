[04:54:59] <gibson042> .
[05:02:48] <mikesherov> where is bot-t?
[05:02:58] <mikesherov> ?bot-t
[05:03:06] <mikesherov> :-\
[05:45:39] <ajpiano> omg perfect timing
[05:45:41] <ajpiano> see remysharp !!
[05:45:55] <DaveMethvin> see remysharp run
[05:45:57] <ajpiano> haha
[05:45:59] <DaveMethvin> run remysharp run!
[05:46:03] <remysharp> ajpiano: hmm - I'm not 100% sure if this is a bug, but I'll get a jsbin ready to confirm.
[05:46:07] <ajpiano> cool
[05:46:21] <remysharp> or quickly: DaveMethvin: q: can you use delegate with special events ($.event.special.MyEvent)? - it's not seeming to work for me (1.6.2)
[05:46:44] <DaveMethvin> well you can in 1.7
[05:46:57] <DaveMethvin> before that you have to deal with the "live" event
[05:47:46] <DaveMethvin> i'd have to see the fiddle/jsbin to see
[05:48:32] <remysharp> ah - then the version I'm on might be the issue
[05:49:08] <remysharp> hmm - no dice - using latest jQuery: http://jsbin.com/akulej/edit#javascript,live
[05:49:15] <remysharp> probably doing something stupid wrong
[05:49:29] <remysharp> you can enter text in the text box - it's supposed to echo
[05:54:22] <remysharp> oh - wait - I think I've ballz up some code somewhere - doesn't work without delegate. I'll be back if it's still dodgy...
[05:55:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's taking me a while to find where jsbin hides things
[05:57:13] <remysharp> what are you missing?
[05:57:33] <remysharp> I just closed the html tab because it's just jquery in there with input + p tags
[05:58:00] <DaveMethvin> where does jquery get included?
[05:58:05] <remysharp> at the top of the source
[05:58:14] <remysharp> the JS is injected at the end of the source (html)
[05:58:22] <remysharp> so it's what you'd expect for the page
[05:59:03] <DaveMethvin> ok i go to render
[05:59:14] <remysharp> there's a live panel on the left - you don't need render
[05:59:22] <remysharp> (sorry - on the right)
[05:59:58] <remysharp> as in - the code is rendered and refreshed in real-time as you make changes in the live panel (on the right)
[06:00:10] <DaveMethvin> no, i'm trying to use the chrome debugger and set breakpoints on your code
[06:00:19] <DaveMethvin> the edit view wont do that, right?
[06:00:22] <remysharp> ah - then remove "edit" form the url
[06:00:28] <DaveMethvin> i need the honest to god code
[06:00:41] <remysharp> then you have the full page with no jsbin chrome
[06:00:51] <remysharp> *from the url
[06:01:01] <remysharp> http://jsbin.com/akulej/
[06:01:28] <DaveMethvin> great, now where is jquery included ... that is, how do i stop it from including the compressed version which is hard to debug?
[06:01:37] <DaveMethvin> i see the tag of course
[06:01:42] <DaveMethvin> i need to edit that
[06:01:49] <remysharp> aaah
[06:02:10] <remysharp> so in "edit" view - on the HTML panel, just change the jquery include in the source
[06:03:23] <DaveMethvin> oh i didn't have the view html on
[06:03:32] <DaveMethvin> again, i'm more of a fiddle guy
[06:03:53] <remysharp> I don't use jsfiddle, sorry
[06:03:53] <DaveMethvin> you mentioned you were testing on 1.6.4?
[06:04:03] <DaveMethvin> this code has .on and .off in it so that wouldn't work
[06:04:14] <remysharp> my particular example was on 1.6.2 - but the version I put up is running on 1.7.1
[06:04:42] <remysharp> okay, forget it - I've got it working - sorry to waste your time!
[06:04:52] <DaveMethvin> hey waitaminit, what was it?
[06:05:43] <remysharp> not sure yet, but I've got it working --
[06:05:48] <remysharp> now I'm trying to see *what* it was
[06:06:02] <DaveMethvin> your demo seemed like it should work in 1.7
[06:06:04] <remysharp> fuck nuts
[06:06:05] <remysharp> I see it
[06:06:13] <remysharp> wanna take a guess?
[06:06:17] <remysharp> :)
[06:06:27] <DaveMethvin> tell me
[06:06:47] <remysharp> wrapping my special event in a jQuery ready function - so I hook the event handle before the special event exists
[06:06:54] <remysharp> then the DOM is ready, and the special event is created
[06:07:06] <DaveMethvin> oh, well that ain't gonna work :P
[06:07:20] <DaveMethvin> and of course you can set the special event immediately
[06:07:21] <remysharp> http://jsbin.com/akulej/3/edit
[06:07:28] <remysharp> yeah - obviously
[06:07:35] <remysharp> I just dooched up my code :)
[06:07:46] <remysharp> again, sorry for the wasting time :)
[06:07:55] <DaveMethvin> be sure to use namespaces on those events
[06:08:12] <ajpiano> and always backup your databases
[06:08:19] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:08:28] <remysharp> wow - so jsfiddle hides that problem
[06:08:29] <DaveMethvin> brush your teeth after every meal
[06:08:31] <remysharp> interesting
[06:09:52] <remysharp> (because it wraps the JS by default in a $(window).load(<your code>) -- in case you were at all interested)
[06:10:18] <DaveMethvin> right
[06:10:51] <DaveMethvin> i hadn't noticed that the original code had the delegate call outside the ready block
[06:11:07] <DaveMethvin> if possible, delegate to something lower than body
[06:11:16] <DaveMethvin> otherwise it's as bad as .live()
[06:11:21] <remysharp> yeah, that was just a contrived example
[06:11:30] <remysharp> my real code has injected form elements
[06:11:35] <remysharp> which is why I was on delegate
[06:11:47] <remysharp> and I'm loading images on change - but want to ensure the content changes, so hence using a custom event
[06:11:55] <remysharp> don't worry, I know the rules :)
[06:12:28] <DaveMethvin> well let me know if anything looks broken, it's not widely used so i wouldn't be surprised
[06:13:49] <remysharp> nah - appears to work from where I'm sat.
[06:23:06] <timmywil> weird server issues
[06:23:12] <timmywil> forgive the messages
[06:26:09] <remysharp> hi - back - DaveMethvin, yeah, there is a bug...
[06:26:31] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, chicken little ... :P
[06:26:37] <remysharp> when the setup method is called, it's called against the element doing the delegating -
[06:26:45] <remysharp> though...arguably that might be right
[06:26:47] <timmywil> i passed a chicken truck this morning…gross
[06:26:50] <DaveMethvin> no, that's intended
[06:26:57] <DaveMethvin> you need to look at the selector
[06:27:03] <remysharp> okay - gotcha
[06:27:09] <remysharp> ah
[06:27:19] <remysharp> but combined with a delegate I guess it's gonna bork eventually
[06:27:27] <remysharp> I have to use delegate in my setup, right?
[06:27:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah if there is a selector
[06:28:11] <DaveMethvin> here let me get you a link to the docs
[06:28:16] <remysharp> ta
[06:28:20] <remysharp> then I'll leave you alone
[06:28:20] <remysharp> :)
[06:28:24] <DaveMethvin> i've had them finished for a week but we haven't figured where to put them
[06:29:10] <DaveMethvin> see if you can get to this one: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rRFvC51lDU8SBqgcsR5XwVKUeW__RO643iXSEVOdQ4/edit
[06:29:40] <remysharp> got it
[06:29:42] <remysharp> it's long
[06:29:45] <remysharp> remy don't do long
[06:29:47] <DaveMethvin> haha
[06:29:49] <remysharp> :(
[06:30:03] <DaveMethvin> well the problem is, when  you want to do delegated events it's complicated
[06:30:25] <remysharp> that said - the find function in google docs works quite well :)
[06:31:11] <DaveMethvin> so you're attaching your event to document, but since you're using the setup  hook you don't know the selector that will be used to attach the event
[06:31:24] <DaveMethvin> it can be different for each event handler attached
[06:31:37] <DaveMethvin> so you'd probably need to use the add hook
[06:31:50] <remysharp> okie
[06:32:44] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at that code for a sec, there may be some simpler way to do it
[06:33:49] <DaveMethvin> remysharp: take a look at the bindType/delegateType mapped events and the handle hook
[06:34:00] <remysharp> yeah, that's where I was up to in your doc
[06:34:17] <DaveMethvin> really all you want to do is be called at keyup and decide whether to fire updated
[06:34:27] <DaveMethvin> it's VERY siimilar to the multiclick example
[06:34:37] <remysharp> indeed
[06:34:52] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: quick question about the needsdocs + transition to xml/github when you get a chance :)
[06:35:09] <DaveMethvin> sure addyosmani
[06:36:29] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: cool. so, I noticed on one of the needsdocs you mentioned waiting on us transitioning over before the docs for a particular item would get updated
[06:36:38] <addyosmani> are we taking that general approach to updating docs? waiting?.
[06:36:53] <addyosmani> Only ask as I wanted to get back in to clearing the docs backlog this weekend, or at least some of it.
[06:36:59] <DaveMethvin> for now we're just business as usual
[06:37:06] <addyosmani> sahweet.
[06:37:13] <DaveMethvin> at some point we'll make the announcment to hold off on changes
[06:37:21] <DaveMethvin> and then switch to github
[06:37:25] <DaveMethvin> not sure when htat will happen
[06:37:31] <DaveMethvin> i can check with rworth
[06:37:40] <addyosmani> I asked him about it yesterday :)
[06:38:00] <addyosmani> said that we're technically ready just waiting on some licence stuff to clear
[06:38:11] <DaveMethvin> oh okay
[06:38:17] <remysharp> DaveMethvin: gotta bust some moves, but cheers for the help - I'll go over that doc in more detail later today. Adios!
[06:38:25] <DaveMethvin> k thanks!
[06:38:30] * remysharp doesn't leave because he's got some irccloud goodness in his pocket
[06:46:22] <ajpiano> remysharp: yay stay in -dev always plz :)
[06:48:32] <kswedberg> rworth, DaveMethvin: how does the github api docs thing handle "includes" (aka "Reusables") like we have in WP?
[06:48:59] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, good question
[06:49:08] <rworth> kswedberg: I haven't touched that, so currently it doesn't handle it any differently than before
[06:49:13] <rworth> meaning, quite well :)
[06:49:29] <kswedberg> so, that stuff won't be in the github repo?
[06:49:30] <rworth> of course, the question we (may) want to answer, is should we look at moving that stuff into GitHub as well
[06:49:45] <rworth> it isn't today, just because all I've imported so far is each post
[06:49:56] <rworth> but we could figure out a way to do it, I'm sure
[06:50:08] <rworth> those are just posts too, right? the reusables?
[06:50:08] <DaveMethvin> we could have something extra in the build/push process
[06:50:15] <kswedberg> and by post you mean the post body (not custom fields)?
[06:50:16] <DaveMethvin> doesn't have to be reusables really, does it?
[06:50:26] <rworth> I'm not using any custom fields atm
[06:50:57] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: no it doesn't. it would just be nice to have some kind of "include" mechanism
[06:51:06] <DaveMethvin> absolutely kswedberg
[06:51:30] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I'm not a fan of Reusables. even aside from it having a broken img src
[06:51:42] <DaveMethvin> yep it's kind of clunky
[06:51:50] <kswedberg> +1
[06:51:50] <DaveMethvin> and very wp-specific
[06:51:54] <kswedberg> +2
[06:51:58] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:54:27] <kswedberg> rworth: if you have time at some point this weekend, I'd love a walkthrough of setting up the github api docs thingie on my local machine. I always manage to mess up one thing when I do any install of anything ever.
[06:55:08] <rworth> kswedberg: sure, I'd be happy to do that
[06:55:22] <kswedberg> rworth: awesome. thx! I'll ping you later then
[06:55:32] <rworth> in fact, I'll work on a proper README, ala https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/README.md
[06:55:53] <DaveMethvin> ?tell remysharp something like this http://jsfiddle.net/XdAxE/
[06:56:09] <DaveMethvin> lazy-ass bot
[06:56:25] <rworth> on the topic of include mechanisms, we'll need the same for jQuery UI docs
[06:56:39] <addyosmani> kswedberg: remember we discussed an api docs contribution guide at some point? how/where to use reusables etc. would be nice to get something written up for the github api docs repo just to cover it (once we have finalized an import mech).
[06:56:39] <rworth> and there we also have envisioned an xml inheritance model
[06:56:44] <rworth> (yet to be implemented)
[06:57:04] <addyosmani> maybe cover some of the other subtleties of formatting/structuring content that we've had to figure out as we go along anyway :)
[06:57:11] <addyosmani> not high priority or anything
[06:57:19] <rworth> since we have a plugin inheritance model with ui.widget, and we don't want to duplicate the documentation of parts inherited from it into each plugin's docs xml
[06:57:37] <DaveMethvin> that will come in handy
[06:58:13] <kswedberg> addyosmani: yeah, sounds great. if you want to take a stab at it, go for it. or, if you want to hash something out together, that would be fine, too. or if you want to post to the google group and get a discussion going, good too. (I'm easy)
[06:58:31] <addyosmani> just for ajpiano: twss
[06:58:37] <addyosmani> but that sounds like a plan kswedberg
[06:59:00] <kswedberg> lol
[06:59:01] <addyosmani> I'll take a stab at it this weekend and see how far I get. Would love to work on it together/with the group once it has a base
[06:59:10] <rworth> kswedberg: for import, do you think it might make sense to import the full edit history from api.jquery.com's WordPress db?
[06:59:15] <kswedberg> addyosmani: awesome.
[06:59:18] <addyosmani> :)
[06:59:21] <kswedberg> also, remember this? http://oksoclap.com/jquery-api-style-guide
[06:59:25] <rworth> as addyosmani mentioned, I'm waiting on the license to be clear first
[06:59:39] <rworth> and then I planned to do that in a new (yet to be created) api.jquery.com repo
[06:59:56] <addyosmani> kswedberg: I thought that had been lost!
[07:00:02] <kswedberg> ;)
[07:00:09] <rwaldron> oh snap
[07:00:17] <rwaldron> kswedberg THAT is what i was looking for!
[07:00:19] <addyosmani> thanks!
[07:00:33] <kswedberg> rwaldron: orly? well, there you have it. :)
[07:00:39] <rwaldron> when i asked you for "guidance"
[07:00:42] <rwaldron> :D
[07:00:43] <kswedberg> ahhh
[07:00:44] <rwaldron> http://oksoclap.com/jquery-api-style-guide
[07:00:48] <rwaldron> i didnt know it then
[07:00:56] <rwaldron> but seeing this, now I do
[07:00:57] <kswedberg> rock on rwaldron!
[07:01:29] <kswedberg> It's been lying dormant for quite some time and is rough around the edges, so all contributions to it are welcome
[07:01:39] <addyosmani> rwaldron: I'm going to try expanding this into a beefier contribution guide for the docs this weekend hopefully. Feel free to make any changes/additions you see fit!
[07:02:46] <kswedberg> rworth: not sure if all the wp revisions need to be in the github repo. seems like a lot of cruft. but if you have a non-crufty way of doing it, go for it. :)
[07:03:54] <rworth> I figured I'd just write a script to import it as commits to give the repo some history
[07:04:13] <rworth> Would make it possible to go back and create tags for 1.5 1.6 and 1.7 docs, for example
[07:04:25] <rworth> certainly not necessary, but not insanely complex
[07:04:57] <rworth> would help clear up the line of copyright/ownership/license/contribution as well
[07:05:20] <rworth> as far as that period of time, and being able to look at the GitHub repo to get a picture of contributors and size of contribution
[07:05:29] <rworth> which if we started clean would only work from now forward
[07:10:53] <kswedberg> sure. if we can do snapshots, that would be great.
[07:11:31] <kswedberg> if you want to tackle it, I will applaud the effort.
[07:11:31] <DaveMethvin> quite often the changes we make are clarifications that apply to previous versions, not sure how to deal with that
[07:11:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we want to maintain docs for every version
[07:11:46] <DaveMethvin> only archive the old ones
[07:12:00] <DaveMethvin> but that means the latest version of the docs may have better or more accurate info about old versions
[07:12:10] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: true. it's messy
[07:12:35] <rworth> I would propose having a branch for each major version, and only maintain it as much as people care to
[07:12:40] <kswedberg> also rworth, I have raw xml dumps in various guises for many versions if you want them
[07:12:51] <rworth> kswedberg: great, that may be handy
[07:12:58] <DaveMethvin> back in a few
[07:13:09] <kswedberg> rworth: remind me this weekend when I bug you about the other stuff. :)
[07:14:55] <kswedberg> rworth: how do we handle DaveMethvin's scenario? like, clarifying something that applies to versions 1.3.2+? do we need to update it in every branch?
[07:14:59] <kswedberg> sounds daunting
[07:24:42] <matjas> jzaefferer: thanks for your email, i’ll need to think about it
[07:35:05] <rwaldron> gibson042 just a heads up, that dude chad from google is trying to make jQuery work wth advanced mode closure compiler
[07:35:33] <rwaldron> so I'd like to limit the amount of chaos between the master and his working branch
[07:37:37] <gibson042> noted
[07:37:45] <gibson042> when is that work expected to be ready?
[07:38:56] <jzaefferer> matjas: what email was that?
[07:39:09] <matjas> cologne js meetup
[07:45:37] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: good question...atm the closure compiler guys are powering through trying to get jquery to compile successfully
[07:45:52] <DaveMethvin> iow, we don't have any idea :D
[07:46:28] <gibson042> :)
[08:14:35] <remysharp> DaveMethvin: that new structure for special events is actually very nice - a lot more verbose (to me at least) compared to previous use
[08:15:22] <remysharp> though, the event.type switcharoo looks a little ropy, but still - I like it.
[08:15:45] <DaveMethvin> remysharp: it makes some scenarios like that simpler for sure ... and yeah i have been thinking it woudl be good to have one more hook to avoid the switch
[08:15:56] <DaveMethvin> although there are cases where you don't want to change the event
[08:16:05] <remysharp> DaveMethvin: why - though - do you restore the event.type right before the return ret?
[08:16:23] <DaveMethvin> ah, because there may be other events after yours
[08:16:28] <DaveMethvin> esp if you attached to document
[08:16:43] <remysharp> ah, and event is an object - yes
[08:16:45] <DaveMethvin> not in these toy cases but in production code
[08:16:50] <remysharp> that bit me hard in the butt the other day.
[08:17:12] <remysharp> object was travelling deep through my application and getting modified - object cloning fixed that bad boy.
[08:17:34] <DaveMethvin> right, you either need to restore state or clone the object
[08:18:06] <remysharp> if you cloned in your example, you couldn't do the .call(this, arguments) - but yeah, I get what you're saying
[08:18:08] <remysharp> makes sense
[08:19:11] <remysharp> I was going to do a throw away blog post on special events (if I actually find time), but I might talk about this method instead - is your doc going live somewhere that I could link to? ---
[08:19:27] <remysharp> that said - client work + baby = zip all time for writing :)
[08:19:40] <DaveMethvin> i hope so, ive just been waiting to talk with kswedberg to figure out where this belongs
[08:20:28] <kswedberg> and I'm so hard to get ahold of.
[08:20:30] <kswedberg> ;)
[08:20:59] <DaveMethvin> well i just keep forgetting
[08:21:13] <kswedberg> just playing with ya
[08:21:36] <DaveMethvin> i think where we left it was i didn't know whether to put it in a big chunk somewhere or split it up
[08:21:47] <DaveMethvin> and if it needs to be split up, where
[08:22:40] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, ajpiano: how about this? … we could post that events article (or an excerpt) on blog.jquery.com in a week or so and introduce it with a couple paragraphs saying, "hey, we've been working on this new learning site. Here is a taste of the type of article you'll see there."
[08:22:53] <DaveMethvin> that works for me
[08:22:59] <kswedberg> a sneak preview, if you will.
[08:23:36] <ajpiano> hmmm
[08:23:49] <DaveMethvin> i have quite a few that I think I can do, but it would be great if there was just a place I could start on them
[08:24:02] <ajpiano> maybe more of an addeundum than an intro
[08:24:11] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: you can start on them in the learning site repo
[08:24:21] <ajpiano> exporting the markdown to html for putting on current blog is NBD
[08:24:47] <DaveMethvin> so will the authoring for learn. be done in md?
[08:25:03] <ajpiano> yes
[08:25:43] <DaveMethvin> ok, i have those docs in html ...know a good md->html converter :)
[08:29:20] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: seen dillinger.io ?
[08:29:30] <DaveMethvin> no
[08:29:38] <ajpiano> lets you author md, see realtime preview, export :)
[08:29:42] <ajpiano> joemccan rocked it
[08:29:59] <DaveMethvin> whoa.
[08:30:05] <ajpiano> treats linebreaks a little weird, but generally awesome
[08:34:02] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: you on a Mac yet?
[08:34:17] <DaveMethvin> nope
[08:34:29] <DaveMethvin> you say that as if i'm planning to move? ::D
[08:35:04] <kswedberg> bummer. yeah. someday. ;) NVAlt has same realtime preview, export of MD->HTML
[08:35:21] <kswedberg> and it's a nice little note-taking app
[08:36:03] <DaveMethvin> well to convert that doc i have to go the other way, html->md
[08:40:46] <kswedberg> ah yeah. I could probably do that for you with a handful of regexes and a beer.
[08:41:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we're at +219 since 1.7.1 btw
[08:41:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know, going the wrong way
[08:42:05] <DaveMethvin> and that's after landing a few that did shrink things like gibson042's setter(undefined)
[08:42:12] <DaveMethvin> bout time you got here bot-t
[08:43:32] <DaveMethvin> the big one was the split-out of properties like border*Width but both gnarf and mikesherov had changes that depended on it
[08:43:49] <DaveMethvin> so i think we either needed to say we wouldn't fix them or put that in
[08:44:32] <DaveMethvin> frankly i don't think we'll be able to shrink things until 1.8, because we can't remove features or change behavior in a point release
[08:52:12] <timmywil> well, we can hold off fixing any more minor bugs in effects until after the effects rewrite, or accepting any more perf improvements that add to size.
[10:56:31] <rwaldron> .
[12:24:12] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: should we have some specific styling for the deprecated stuff?
[12:24:34] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yes.
[12:24:40] <DaveMethvin> it's a big tricky since sometimes it's the whole method and other times it's just  a signature
[12:24:40] <kswedberg> link?
[12:24:54] <kswedberg> Hey, that's my pimp name! (Big Tricky)
[12:25:13] <DaveMethvin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[12:25:20] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:25:30] <DaveMethvin> biggee smalls
[12:25:47] <kswedberg> :)
[12:25:57] <DaveMethvin> so on that one it is the whole method
[12:26:06] <DaveMethvin> but it would be easy to miss the Deprecated
[12:26:35] <DaveMethvin> i need to add a para to the front to say it will be pluginned
[12:26:41] <DaveMethvin> if you don't mind my verbification
[12:26:48] <kswedberg> yeah. I see your point.
[12:26:56] <kswedberg> nah. please do so
