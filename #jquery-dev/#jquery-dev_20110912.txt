[06:38:51] <rwaldron> <3 jaubourg
[06:39:08] <jaubourg> hey rick
[06:39:13] <jaubourg> sup?
[06:39:21] <rwaldron> oh hai!
[06:39:27] <rwaldron> not much
[06:39:35] <rwaldron> had a great weekend at open video conference
[06:39:46] <rwaldron> did a sweet popcorn.js presentation
[06:39:55] <jaubourg> I'm good... just found myself a punk girlfriend who'll probably come by Boston for a week at one point
[06:40:08] <rwaldron> nice!
[06:40:13] <rwaldron> punk girls are crazy
[06:40:14] <jaubourg> yummy, popcorn prez
[06:40:20] <jaubourg> she's nice punk
[06:40:30] <rwaldron> that's an oxymoron
[06:40:33] <rwaldron> :D
[06:40:42] <jaubourg> like pinup punk if you see what I mean
[06:40:49] <rwaldron> hm.
[06:40:58] <rwaldron> like.. rockabilly
[06:41:06] <jaubourg> yeah, somehow
[06:41:11] <rwaldron> gotcha
[06:41:13] <rwaldron> i think
[06:41:16] <rwaldron> REBASE
[06:41:20] <jaubourg> she's difficult to classify
[06:41:26] <rwaldron> that's the best kind
[06:41:46] <jaubourg> I gotta do something first and I shudder to think of all the conflicts I have to resolve
[06:41:56] <jaubourg> will teach me to dev early
[06:42:04] <rwaldron> just make sure you do it on a scratch first :D
[06:42:06] <jaubourg> and I need to rename a lot of stuff too
[06:42:21] <rwaldron> you can do it
[06:42:25] <rwaldron> i have faith
[06:42:37] <jaubourg> yep... oh an I quit smoking
[06:42:43] <jaubourg> like for more than a week now
[06:43:14] <jaubourg> anyway, gotta go out a bit then rebase then...
[06:43:17] <jaubourg> bbiab
[06:43:21] <rwaldron> YES
[06:43:27] <rwaldron> later
[07:05:27] <gnarf> hey rwaldron you hanging out?
[07:37:01] <jaubourg> man, this'll be difficult
[07:37:22] <jaubourg> I'd probably better be off taking the files I changed and apply them on top of the current jQuery
[07:44:40] <gnarf> hrm
[07:44:41] <gnarf> wtf
[07:44:48] <gnarf> I'm trying to make a new pull request
[07:45:22] <gnarf> best i can tell the only one of these that should really be there is the last one http://cl.ly/1L0H252t2u1V0I1W0d1g
[07:46:09] <gnarf> nvm i figure it out
[07:47:26] <gnarf> so used to working in origin on ui i forget its upstream on core
[08:33:03] <jaubourg> if "selector: pseudo - misc" test failing in origin/master?
[08:33:13] <jaubourg> say yes and make my day, pretty please
[08:33:19] <jaubourg> (chrome)
[08:35:42] <jaubourg> ok, I don't see how anything I did could make this fail, so I'll consider this done
[08:38:08] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg created 1.7/callbacks-sept2011 (+1 new commit): http://git.io/Y_u5Vw
[08:38:08] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.7/callbacks-sept2011] $.Callbacks, $.Topic and notify/progress on $.Deferred. - jaubourg
[08:38:18] <jaubourg> done
[08:43:36] <jaubourg> now I need to try and slim it down to pretty much nothing ;)
[08:43:43] <jaubourg> \o/
[08:48:29] <jaubourg> meeting today, right?
[08:52:48] <JohnResig> jaubourg: yep!
[08:54:28] <jaubourg> \o/ again
[08:54:32] <jaubourg> and hi John
[08:56:40] <rwaldron> hey JohnResig
[08:57:12] <JohnResig> hey all!
[08:57:18] <JohnResig> alright, see you in #jquery-meeting
[09:32:55] <timmywil> if anyone else wants to review the sizzle changes, that's cool too. I'm in your code, messing with your selectors.
[09:33:15] <jaubourg> :)
[09:37:41] <timmywil> sizzle https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/compare/master...1.7%2Fsizzle jquery https://github.com/jquery/jquery/compare/master...1.7%2Fsizzle
[09:40:12] <timmywil> ah, meant to move that fixSpecified var declaration
[09:40:56] <jaubourg> ~(" " + value + " ")
[09:41:07] <jaubourg> just for smaller code?
[09:41:21] <timmywil> oh, heh, yea
[09:42:01] <timmywil> I was doing a breakpoint there at some point.  guess i didn't change it back
[09:42:15] <jaubourg> meh, do we really need such opti? I mean, it's like 2 bytes
[09:42:31] <jaubourg> (just in the idea that jQuery and sizzle's code should be understandable)
[09:42:37] <timmywil> no not really
[09:42:52] <timmywil> that's just what I do when I use indexOf.  didn't really mean to change it
[09:43:00] <jaubourg> no biggy
[09:43:32] <jaubourg> I'm just wondering about gain vs cost here (size vs readability)
[09:44:35] <timmywil> idk, i've done ~ for a while now, but I understand that more people understand >=0
[09:45:30] <timmywil> besides, I would have changed the other indexOf as well
[09:45:45] <timmywil> if I was really wanting to save 4 bytes
[09:45:45] <jaubourg> hehe, the old man I am always have some stop time when he encounters ~ as a mean to >= 0
[09:46:00] <jaubourg> yeah, figured
[09:46:41] <jaubourg> man, we're talking a lot for something that inconsequential, aren't we? ;) :P
[09:46:54] <timmywil> fo shizzle
[09:46:58] <jaubourg> yo man
[09:48:17] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to 1.7/sizzle: http://git.io/8kD-sA
[09:48:17] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.7/sizzle] Move the fixSpecified var declaration to the top - timmywil
[09:49:55] <timmywil> i'll change it back to >=0, but i'll just do that locally and squash when I merge.
[09:50:15] <timmywil> otherwise i'd have to put your name in the commit message for fun
[09:50:28] <jaubourg> haha
[09:50:39] <jaubourg> "Nitpicky jaubourg did it again"
[09:54:40] <jaubourg> k, gotta fly, rpg session tonight
[09:54:45] <jaubourg> see you around guys
[09:55:01] <timmywil> later jaubourg!

[17:28:54] <rwaldron> am
[17:31:46] <gnarf> cool
[17:31:47] <gnarf> so
[17:32:09] <jaubourg> hang on... 1.6.5pre?
[17:33:08] <rwaldron> yeah
[17:33:27] <gnarf> docs#8909 - I'm working on redoing this branch
[17:33:28] <bot-t> [#8909] $(element).data() will scan all attributes more than needed. (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/8909
[17:33:38] <rwaldron> looking
[17:33:56] <rwaldron> jaubourg 1.6.5pre doesn't mean we'll actually have a 1.6.5
[17:33:57] <timmywil> jaubourg: yea, john's wacky
[17:34:23] <gnarf> I'm wondering if there is something better than setting a "parsedAttrs" in _data - because I had to basically make the unit tests ignore the "private cache"
[17:34:43] <rwaldron> er
[17:34:59] <rwaldron> so, you're not changing the tests are you?
[17:35:24] <gnarf> i want to avoid it
[17:35:40] <gnarf> but then i run into the other data bug i have assigned
[17:35:53] <rwaldron> thing is... we cant change them like.. at all
[17:36:02] <rwaldron> or at least the public behaviour
[17:36:06] <gnarf> docs#8921
[17:36:07] <bot-t> [#8921] jQuery private data should (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/8921
[17:36:35] <rwaldron> hm
[17:36:40] <gnarf> the pull from 8909 shows the changes i needed to make
[17:36:51] <rwaldron> i'm way too tired to be any help right now :(
[17:36:54] <gnarf> heh
[17:36:59] <rwaldron> i'm really sorry
[17:37:05] <gnarf> np...
[17:37:11] <rwaldron> i'll look but dont take my word as law
[17:37:13] <rwaldron> ok?
[17:37:47] <gnarf> I'm wondering if I couldn't set like this[0].setAttribute( jQuery.expando+"data", 1 ); and test for that
[17:38:36] <gnarf> it would be "cleaner" from the outside looking in
[17:39:39] <rwaldron> I say try it
[17:39:43] <rwaldron> if it sucks
[17:39:50] <rwaldron> then at least we know it sucks
[17:39:56] <rwaldron> and can say so confidently
[17:39:58] <gnarf> does it suck to make a second attr?
[17:40:04] <rwaldron> it might
[17:40:10] <gnarf> i dunno why I'm trying to avoid doing that
[17:40:17] <rwaldron> timmywil should advise on attr creation
[17:40:39] <timmywil> what's an attr
[17:41:14] <rwaldron> dunno
[17:41:23] <rwaldron> i need to walk alli the dog
[17:41:35] <rwaldron> she's getting needy
[17:41:52] <gnarf> timmywil: so- the goal is to have a flag "per element" that tells .data() that the .attributes have been scaned for data-*
[17:42:05] <gnarf> to avoid looping all the attributes on every call to .data()
[17:42:15] <timmywil> ah yes, ok
[17:42:26] <gnarf> if i use .data() i'm adding a key to the data object - which makes tests fail
[17:42:41] <gnarf> if i use ._data() - the private cache - it adds a property to the data object
[17:42:59] <timmywil> but a private one
[17:43:06] <timmywil> that's not ok?
[17:43:28] <gnarf> i have to change unit tests to "ignore" the "private" data key
[17:43:36] <gnarf> because well, docs#8921
[17:43:37] <bot-t> [#8921] jQuery private data should (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/8921
[17:43:47] <gnarf> the private data isn't really "private" its just .data( jQuery.expando )
[17:44:16] <gnarf> My thought was, perhaps just avoid .data() altogether
[17:44:51] <timmywil> nothing's REALLY private
[17:45:08] <gnarf> and just use another attribute on the DOM element to store the flag
[17:45:29] <gnarf> like elem[ jQuery.expando ] = the numeric index
[17:45:54] <timmywil> well that would replace our data cache
[17:46:00] <timmywil> you mean some other key
[17:46:04] <gnarf> I could do something like if ( !elem[ jQuery.expando + "parsedDataAttributes" ] ) {}
[17:46:31] <timmywil> hmm, yea and i guess that would be quick, but then we have two things on the element when we used to only have one
[17:46:38] * gnarf nods
[17:46:54] <gnarf> its that or we have a 'private' data key in tests where we used to have none....
[17:47:14] <timmywil> we could clean it
[17:47:41] <timmywil> .removeData( 'parsedDataasdfoijwef', true)
[17:47:56] <timmywil> we do that in several places
[17:48:09] <gnarf> in the test?
[17:48:11] <timmywil> it's a way of saying, we know we're leaking memory here, but it's on purpose
[17:48:16] <timmywil> yea
[17:48:53] <gnarf> yeah, if you look at the pull i had on 8909 before - it just ignored / deleted the data[ jQuery.expando ]
[17:49:00] <gnarf> aka "private cache"
[17:49:17] <gnarf> in the tests
[17:49:20] <timmywil> well, no need to delete the entire cache, just the key you are aware of
[17:49:41] <timmywil> the rest should take care of themselves
[17:50:35] <gnarf> its the only thing that should be in the private cache at that point
[17:50:47] <timmywil> perfect
[17:50:56] <gnarf> which is why i just deleted the whole thing
[17:50:57] <gnarf> but
[17:51:38] <gnarf> i still don't like the fact that $("<div>").data() would return { (jQuery.expando): { parsedAttrs: true } }
[17:51:40] <timmywil> an example is in unit/effects.js
[17:51:57] <timmywil> jQuery.checkState removes the olddisplay private data
[17:52:02] <timmywil> cause it leaks
[17:52:15] <timmywil> it wouldn't
[17:52:55] <gnarf> but it does?
[17:53:28] <timmywil> .data() returns private data?
[17:53:35] <timmywil> sounds like a bug
[17:55:09] <timmywil> nah, if you use jQuery._data(), you're fine
[17:56:29] <timmywil> right? i'd be surprised if we returned that.
[17:57:30] <gnarf> timmywil: docs#8921
[17:57:31] <gnarf> :)
[17:57:55] <gnarf> it does return the "private data"
[17:58:00] <timmywil> dang http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/GyK7d/
[17:58:01] <bot-t> timmywil, #8921 (jQuery private data should) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8921
[17:58:17] <timmywil> well, i think that was an oversight
[17:58:38] <timmywil> kinda the point of an internal key
[17:59:20] <gnarf> well
[17:59:28] <timmywil> well, regardless, i don't see a reason why this parsedDataAttributes thing can't be private
[17:59:32] <gnarf> i mean, my thought was to restructure _data to use a second cache
[17:59:44] <gnarf> for 8921
[17:59:47] <gnarf> to avoid passing it back
[18:00:02] <gnarf> but - it will not work on non-nodes, for garbage collection reasons
[18:00:15] <timmywil> I really like that we only infect one property
[18:00:29] <timmywil> the internal key is there to separate off our stuff
[18:00:43] <timmywil> if we want to keep it private, we can just not return it on a full cache call
[18:00:54] <gnarf> timmywil: then we aren't returning the "real object"
[18:01:00] <gnarf> which is a must for .data()
[18:01:10] <timmywil> we're returning all public data
[18:01:42] <gnarf> cuz you wanna be able to $.extend( elem.data(), { some: "new", keys: "to set" });
[18:01:56] <timmywil> my point is, it's more important to have only one property on the element used for data than to make private data a little more private
[18:02:24] <timmywil> gnarf: you're not going to extend the randomly generated internal expando
[18:02:38] <timmywil> and if you are, you know you are
[18:03:06] <timmywil> private data may be on the same cache object, but it's not on the same level
[18:04:52] <timmywil> so i certainly wouldn't worry about parsedAttrs getting overwritten
[18:06:18] <timmywil> anyway, maybe separating the private data from the main cache is a bigger issue than I'm seeing right now
[18:11:18] <gnarf> timmywil: im not so worried about someone overwriting my stuff
[18:11:28] <gnarf> I'm just not a big fan of it being passed back
[18:11:51] <timmywil> i assumed it woudn't be passed back
[18:12:09] <timmywil> it's not particularly useful
[18:12:47] <gnarf> yeah
[18:13:04] <gnarf> i mean, setting the attr on the dom element works too
[18:13:16] <gnarf> but then we are polluting the dom element more than we need
[18:13:24] <gnarf> maybe even making a second cache? *shrug*
[18:16:37] <timmywil> i think put it in the private cache for now (because it really is just private data) and we should discuss how private that data should be
[18:16:58] <timmywil> i'm for just not returning it on .data()
[18:17:49] <gnarf> we can't really disconnect it
[18:17:59] <gnarf> thats my fear
[18:18:07] <gnarf> you want .data() to be the WHOLE data object
[18:18:12] <timmywil> why?
[18:18:18] <gnarf> so you can edit it
[18:18:29] <gnarf> i do that ALL the time
[18:18:30] <timmywil> we don't the user editing private data
[18:18:33] <timmywil> want*
[18:18:33] <gnarf> var data = $(this).data();
[18:18:49] <gnarf> then edit props on data.
[18:19:32] <gnarf> so we have to pass the actual object stored so changes to it are saved right?
[18:19:39] <gnarf> i mean, the _data
[18:19:49] <timmywil> it just clicked
[18:19:50] <gnarf> my thought was just make a second dataCache for internal data
[18:19:55] <timmywil> has to be pass by reference
[18:20:14] <gnarf> right, we can't pass a copy of it without the private data
[18:20:22] <gnarf> so we have to remove private data from the cache
[18:20:36] <timmywil> yea, then there's the question of where does it go
[18:20:44] <timmywil> well, ok
[18:20:59] <timmywil> i guess that's why it works the way it doew now
[18:21:20] <gnarf> now
[18:21:23] <gnarf> problem number 2
[18:21:28] <timmywil> haha
[18:21:30] <gnarf> if we remove private data
[18:21:36] <gnarf> and make a "second cache"
[18:21:58] <timmywil> that makes my spine twitch
[18:22:05] <gnarf> heh
[18:22:11] <gnarf> its not that hard - for nodes
[18:22:19] <gnarf> but this whole concept of .data() on plain objects
[18:22:33] <gnarf> we CANT "cleanup" the cache for them
[18:22:38] <gnarf> they have to be a property
[18:22:55] <timmywil> it's not hard, but it's more DOM manipulation, more potential for memory leaks
[18:23:04] <timmywil> and it's just taboo
[18:23:57] <timmywil> when we added data, we did it in a way that said, we HAVE to put this here, but just this one thing don't worry.
[18:24:14] <timmywil> this how i think about it :P
[18:25:27] <timmywil> hehe, you know what we could do?
[18:25:33] <gnarf> im all ears
[18:25:35] <timmywil> data-parsed-attrs
[18:25:36] <gnarf> i have my ideas
[18:25:39] <gnarf> yeah
[18:25:42] <gnarf> thats what i was thinking
[18:25:50] <gnarf> set an attr on the dom that made sense
[18:26:20] <timmywil> im kinda kidding. should probably more private than that
[18:27:01] <timmywil> i still say the var belongs in our private data cache, but maybe we'll end up moving the whole private cache
[18:31:41] <timmywil> this might fill up the chat

[18:32:40] <timmywil> that's all of the branches, but no pulls yet
[18:33:02] <gnarf> why? i mean - once we set it - /me grins
[18:33:07] <gnarf> woah
[18:33:12] <gnarf> half thought still on the buffer there
[18:33:13] <gnarf> sorry
[18:33:14] <gnarf> lol
[18:33:35] <gnarf> so - I'm gonna rebuild this private data cache
[18:33:38] <gnarf> pull
[18:33:56] <timmywil> well, i'll be interested to see what you do with it
[18:34:09] <gnarf> i think i'm just going to join the fix for both
[18:34:34] <timmywil> i wouldn't do that if you want it in 1.7
[18:34:36] <gnarf> i just made a pull today that should be easy
[18:35:02] <gnarf> they are both blocker 1.7 - i can make it two diff commits
[18:35:41] <gnarf> I'm kinda afraid of whats gonna happen with the private data in the tests
[18:35:44] <timmywil> ok, i thought there would be more controversy over moving private data.  I guess i missed that convo
[18:35:49] <gnarf> but we will see
[18:36:32] <gnarf> timmywil: i didn't even realize that it came up
[18:36:34] <gnarf> :)
[18:36:52] <gnarf> it just doesn't make sense that our "private" data isn't private
[18:37:24] <gnarf> theres no reason to ever put it in the "data cache" for an element
[18:37:34] <gnarf> with the notable exception of "data on an object"
[18:37:35] <timmywil> i understand the need for it.  I'm just not so sure we're going to like the fix when we see it.
[18:47:01] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to 1.7/combined: http://git.io/wkkSSQ
[18:47:01] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.7/combined] Fix inArray for positive start indices - timmywil
[18:49:40] <gnarf> timmywil: random question
[18:49:47] <timmywil> sup
[18:49:57] <gnarf> I don't think we ever use "private data" on non-nodes right?
[18:50:16] <gnarf> do we need to support it?
[18:50:20] <gnarf> its internal only
[18:50:33] <timmywil> hmm, i can't imagine why
[18:50:45] <gnarf> that makes things a little easier
[18:50:56] <timmywil> if it didn't need to be on a node, we'd just scope it
[18:51:14] <gnarf> right
[18:52:29] <timmywil> aight, im all done for today
[18:52:39] <timmywil> i'll do pulls tomorrow
[18:53:11] <timmywil> ttyl gnarf!
[18:53:20] <gnarf> thx for the input
[19:19:44] <gnarf> grr
[22:19:06] <gnarf> oh nice
[22:19:16] <gnarf> i think i finally unraveled this _data
[22:55:55] <gnarf> now for the devil
[22:55:58] <gnarf> does it work in ie
[22:55:59] <gnarf> :)
[23:33:37] <gnarf> hrm
