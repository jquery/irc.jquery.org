[07:12:24] <jaubourg> plop DaveMethvin
[07:12:36] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg!
[07:12:44] <DaveMethvin> let me get a cup of coffee
[07:12:46] <jaubourg> got your mail, got my reply?
[07:12:52] <DaveMethvin> oh lemme look
[07:13:15] <jaubourg> I'll be interrupted by a work rdv at one point though I don't expect it to be long
[07:13:24] <DaveMethvin> ok, we can skype now if you want
[07:13:33] <jaubourg> ok
[07:13:39] <DaveMethvin> just one minute, coffeeeee
[07:13:44] <jaubourg> hahaha
[07:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: ":not( .ui-menu-item ):has( a )" is all busted in IE6/7
[07:36:20] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: ok, I'm pretty sure this pull from gibson042 will take care of it
[07:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have an idea when that will land?
[07:37:56] <timmywil> I need to talk to him about his pull first
[07:38:34] <timmywil> It's a large one.
[07:43:53] <timmywil> rwaldron: u there?
[07:44:44] <rwaldron> timmywil i am
[07:44:50] <timmywil> I'd like to land this...https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/118/files, but this will affect the selector.js build

[07:44:58] <timmywil> linky
[07:56:24] <rwaldron> timmywil looking
[07:56:48] <rwaldron> timmywil have you tested?
[07:57:42] <rwaldron> timmywil so, let's just do it
[07:57:52] <rwaldron> and figure out how to fix it
[07:57:59] <rwaldron> I'm here right now
[07:58:16] <timmywil> all of it can be removed when Sizzle is added to jQuery
[07:58:19] <rwaldron> if you have the time, I doubt it will take much to sort through it.
[07:58:22] <rwaldron> ok
[07:58:44] <timmywil> you're right tho, I'll add a test
[07:59:01] <rwaldron> oooh no, I mean
[07:59:06] <rwaldron> did you "test"
[07:59:16] <rwaldron> as in, did you test what happens when you put this into jQuery
[07:59:37] <timmywil> oh, no, but Sizzle shouldn't be defining within jQuery
[07:59:57] <timmywil> unless jQuery defines itself with a dependency
[08:00:21] <rwaldron> word
[08:00:26] <timmywil> but since it's inserted and part of jQuery, simply removing all of this is the way to go
[08:00:36] <rwaldron> okey doke
[08:03:19] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I hate you, now I can't stop thinking about how awesome it'll be
[08:03:41] <jaubourg> hi timmy, rick :)
[08:03:45] <jaubourg> and scott :)
[08:03:50] <rwaldron> hi jaubourg :)

[08:04:53] <DaveMethvin> damn, timmywil can't stop adding teh awesomes to sizzle
[08:05:45] <timmywil> rwaldron: all yours :)

[08:07:23] <rwaldron> it's on like donky kong.
[08:07:29] <rwaldron> donkey*
[08:07:31] <rwaldron> wtf...
[08:07:56] <rwaldron> timmywil idea...
[08:08:25] <rwaldron> previously, we used a regex because it was one line and easy
[08:08:41] <rwaldron> that's out now
[08:09:39] <rwaldron> if you put "// EXPOSE" before and after that block, this can be split, index 1 replaced and joined
[08:09:42] <rwaldron> boom. done.
[08:10:09] <timmywil> gotcha, I can do that
[08:10:52] <rwaldron> does that sound reasonable?
[08:10:58] <timmywil> totes
[08:11:09] <rwaldron> it's a weird solution "depends on some comments"
[08:11:17] <rwaldron> but I don't see a clean way around it
[08:11:30] <rwaldron> (I don't think there ever was a clean way haha"
[08:11:31] <rwaldron> )
[08:11:49] <timmywil> yea, making it easy to strip this out is a good idea anyway
[08:12:35] <rwaldron> rad
[08:12:39] <rwaldron> do it up
[08:12:54] <rwaldron> It's done on my side

[08:38:43] <timmywil> nobody look
[08:41:10] * jaubourg looks
[08:55:55] <gnarf> timmywil: boo push -f
[08:56:11] <timmywil> gnarf: i know i know, sorry
[08:56:41] <timmywil> won't happen again
[08:56:44] <gnarf> too late to bother fixing now, but like - don't do it - ever --- revert the commit and recommit it with the right author if you were really worried about it ;)
[08:57:09] <gnarf> sizlle prolly has less people tracking it using "git pull" than some of the others
[08:57:40] <timmywil> yea, but it's only an issue if someone's already pulled in the Sizzle changes, which I very much doubt. Still, I can revert next time.
[08:57:42] <gnarf> hey jaubourg
[08:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What versions of jQuery do you think color should support?
[08:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> I added >=1.5 to the repo this morning.
[08:58:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: at this point I believe it supports 1.5+
[08:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> Since 1.5.1 was already in there.
[08:58:31] <gnarf> even then, I think it would still work on 1.4
[08:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to go lower than 1.4.3, we'll need to detect on jQuery.css
[08:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> But that's just one line.
[08:59:29] <gnarf> I just don't really want to be in the habbit of supporting jQuery back that far - 1.5 makes sense, and falls in line with 1.8 right?  1.8 actually requires 1.6+ ?
[08:59:39] <gnarf> er sry
[09:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, UI 1.9 will be 1.6+
[09:00:04] <gnarf> s/1\.8/UI 1.9/g in that last sentance
[09:00:27] <jaubourg> hey gnarf
[09:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> So if 1.5+ is the target, I think we're good. And we can now run tests against all of those versions.
[09:01:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lets call it 1.5+ so people can be forced to at least have Deferred ;)
[09:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:02:12] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: meeting!!!!!
[09:02:18] <jaubourg> :)
[09:02:20] <DaveMethvin> yep!
[09:02:57] <DaveMethvin> meeting time timmywil rwaldron gibson042 jaubourg gnarf anyone else i missed
[09:03:25] <gnarf> hey
[09:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> umm...wtf?
[09:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: I think this is your push -f http://swarm.jquery.org/job/193
[09:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...did that actually make it to the jquery repo?
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> I guess so
[09:04:53] <timmywil> the next job should be fine
[09:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it is.
[09:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, fine in that the tests are running.
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Still has failures :-P
[09:05:27] <timmywil> well, yea, but the expected ones ;P
[09:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess core doesn't do a smoke test in phantom before submitting to TestSwarm :-/
[09:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We need to fix that ^
[09:07:04] <timmywil> actually, it's not the force push
[09:07:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I don't think cores smoke test works right now because of the ajax issue
[09:07:09] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #229: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/229/
[09:07:10] <jq-jenkins> * timmywillisn: Update Sizzle: added EXPOSE comment
[09:07:10] <jq-jenkins> * waldron.rick: Update grunt:selector task to handle new Sizzle EXPOSE block
[09:07:11] <jq-jenkins> * waldron.rick: Fixes indentation in grunt.js
[09:07:14] <timmywil> it couldn't build
[09:08:13] <timmywil> er, maybe, well, it shouldn't have been able to build without rick's update
[09:17:50] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Color build #50: FAILURE in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/50/
[09:17:50] <jq-jenkins> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Grunt: Add authors task.
[09:17:51] <jq-jenkins> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Added ability to run tests against multiple versions of jQuery.
[09:24:46] <timmywil> yea http://swarm.jquery.org/job/193 isn't broken because of the -f. When I added AMD support, it broke the selector.js build as expected, which rick fixed in the next commit.
[09:37:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I think I might start collecting some effects 1.8 plugins together -- like jQuery.rAF.js ;)
[09:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Win8 coming soon. Let's see how much of a roar that makes re: Touch Events. http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/07/09/upcoming-windows-milestones-shared-with-partners-at-wpc.aspx
[09:38:45] <gnarf> timmywil: history doesn't matter much - it was a broken commit, which means it should show up broken in the swarm job log ;)
[09:39:08] <gnarf> if something is submitting broken jobs, we want to fix it - but getting a fail out of swarm for something that was actually failing is a good thing right?
[09:39:12] <timmywil> gnarf: ok, it just seemed to be sucking up browsers unnecessarily
[09:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, onyl sort of. If everything was configured properly, it never would've made it to swarm :-P
[09:40:04] <gnarf> oh - is that why http://swarm.jquery.org/job/195 failed?
[09:40:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - it should have failed the phantomjs smoke test
[09:40:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but we need to get a grunt based server doing whatever needs to be done to test the AJAX shit right correct?
[09:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the smoke test could not run ajax...
[09:41:28] <gnarf> okay
[09:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Having a smoke test against 80% of code is better than not having a smoke test.
[09:42:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this sounds like something you could help core get done then? :)
[09:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if that's configured in jenkins or in the repo.
[09:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> When jzaefferer is around, I'm sure he can get it setup within a few minutes.
[09:43:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so long as the grunt task that pushes to swarm has the phantom test as a pre-req it will work fine in the repo
[09:44:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: or I could add "grunt unit" before the push in the shell script that jenkins runs
[09:44:32] <gnarf> but it seems that it makes more sense to just make the swarm push require it, or even the actual build (but that could be a whole lot of time)
[09:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't seem to be how it works for UI.
[09:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably configured in Jenkins.
[09:46:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: UI's jenkins job runs grunt build
[09:46:27] <gnarf> then copies to CDN
[09:46:37] <gnarf> then runs swarm push / grunt testswarm
[09:46:50] <gnarf> i assume the grunt build fails when the smoke fails
[09:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> grunt.registerTask( "build", "concat min cssmin copy:dist_units_images" );
[09:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> No smoke test in there.
[09:47:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: then we aren't smoke testing UI either
[09:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure we are.
[09:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> I could be wrong though.
[09:47:59] <gnarf> hrm
[09:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to remember a build failing really fast and not existing in swarm.
[09:48:04] <gnarf> it looks like we are in the console
[09:48:14] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #230: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/230/
[09:48:15] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Update Sizzle: fixes author of a previous commit
[09:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh....
[09:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> umm..
[09:48:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what abouit the testswarm task?
[09:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty thinking of a problem doing the actual build.
[09:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> The testswarm task has no deps and just submits jobs to swarm.
[09:49:09] <gnarf> aha here it is
[09:49:10] <gnarf> npm install --color false
[09:49:10] <gnarf> JUNIT_OUTPUT=test-results/ grunt lint csslint htmllint junit --no-color
[09:49:16] <gnarf> ^^^ thats the smoke
[09:49:46] <gnarf> if we can get a junit task in core, i can add that same line
[09:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't look like we have any config for junit.
[09:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just: grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-junit" );
[09:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's built to just hook into the existing qunit task?
[09:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Yeah, that broken build is really killing the browser usage :-/
[09:51:36] <gnarf> thats my guess, i think it just exports a junit xml file for jenkins
[09:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably hitting the max retries on every test.
[09:51:48] <gnarf> and krinkle isn't here
[09:52:19] <gnarf> I'm not really sure how to remove a single job from swarm and/or mark it complete
[09:53:03] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: in this case, the broken build was unavoidable
[09:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:53:28] <gnarf> timmywil: ?
[09:53:47] <gnarf> you couldn't push the change to the external commit id and also the fix to the build process in the same commit?
[09:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> bah
[09:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> I just deleted it in Jenkins, which of course is not what I wanted.
[09:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if you can delete a job in TestSwarm without going into the db.
[09:54:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i'm pretty sure it requires DB access
[09:54:27] <timmywil> gnarf: if I had done it all myself
[09:54:59] <gnarf> timmywil: push to branch for rwaldron to ammend the commit and push clean? ;)
[09:55:29] <gnarf> Lemme see if i can find a way to delete a job
[09:55:39] <timmywil> ok, we could have done that
[09:58:05] <gnarf> delete from run_useragent WHERE run_id IN (select run_id from runs where job_id=193); delete from runs where job_id=193; delete from jobs where id=193;
[09:58:10] <gnarf> lets hope i didn't blow anything else up
[09:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> OMG WHAT DID YOU DO?
[09:58:39] <gnarf> well it looks like i blew everything else up
[09:58:41] <gnarf> damnit
[09:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> TestSwarm is hosed.
[09:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[10:00:23] <gnarf> the history is hosed
[10:00:28] <gnarf> but i think its still working
[10:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even know what's going on right now.
[10:01:01] <timmywil> ok, sorry guys!
[10:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> The project pages are totally broken.
[10:01:06] <timmywil> I feel bad now
[10:01:18] <gnarf> ?swarm
[10:01:19] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[10:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: gnarf's db delete is worse than your push -f and broken build combined :-P
[10:01:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - but it just blew up history
[10:01:43] <gnarf> i don't think its handing out those tests again
[10:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymobile
[10:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, only two browsers...
[10:02:18] <gnarf> sigh
[10:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> The next build will probably be a full build.
[10:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Mobile Branch Preview
[10:04:04] <gnarf> i wonder why that delete failed so badly
[10:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea.
[10:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, gnarf is trying to compete with ajpiano :-P
[10:06:50] * gnarf shrugs
[10:07:28] <gnarf> that souldn't of deleted anything more that job 193 according to everything defined in the schema, which is why I was okay running it
[10:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> "That shouldn't have delete anything more than the spam..." :-)
[10:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the queries look good.
[10:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> I learned a long time ago you never run a DELETE without first running it as a SELECT.
[10:08:39] <gnarf> yeah - i learned to backup databases before you delete too - but like - its just swarm ;)
[10:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> hehe
[10:09:18] <gnarf> and all these jQuery mobile jobs
[10:09:19] <gnarf> wtf
[10:09:30] * gnarf taps foot waiting for mobile to build for the third time...
[10:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what's up with that. It look like they kick off 3 builds per commit?
[10:09:55] <gnarf> yeah
[10:10:22] <gnarf> and because one of them eats up a lot of ram, we can't run more than one at a time or it will barf on itself
[10:10:42] <gnarf> at least until clarkbox gets this new environment ready for us ;)
[10:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> Well, as soon as this phantom build finishes, we'll get a normal UI build.
[10:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then color (which should be fast).
[10:11:43] <gibson042> timmywil: you around?
[10:11:43] <gnarf> ircjsbot: tell Krinkle - I totally hosed swarm today trying to delete a bad job that was causing browsers to hang... Not sure why but: delete from run_useragent WHERE run_id IN (select run_id from runs where job_id=193); delete from runs where job_id=193; delete from jobs where id=193; deleted like every column in run_useragent
[10:11:43] <ircjsbot> gnarf, I‚Äôll tell Krinkle about that.
[10:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can see if UI is passing against jquery-git.
[10:12:02] <timmywil> gibson042: hey there
[10:12:14] <timmywil> let's chat
[10:12:30] <timmywil> you got quite a pull there
[10:14:52] <gnarf> This mobile phantom master job in jenkins is slow as shit :)
[10:16:15] <gnarf> seems like ~70% of the way through tho
[10:16:38] <gnarf> i'll brb while I wait to see if I REALLY fucked up swarm, or just deleted history
[10:17:53] <timmywil> gibson042: still around?
[10:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, what are they doing that makes a phantom build so slow?
[10:19:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems they are testing everything in the suite against 2 versions of jQuery core?
[10:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG
[10:20:58] <gnarf> well we got 3 more suites to go through it seems
[10:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> The navigation test takes 6 minutes o_O
[10:23:23] * gnarf shrugs ask johnbender :)
[10:26:03] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: the tests are at the interaction level
[10:26:08] <johnbender> we don't have many proper unit tests
[10:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/199
[10:26:49] <johnbender> given the way that navigation is built I'm not even sure how we would go about building unit tests
[10:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: 6 minutes of interactions? Sounds a bit intense.
[10:26:58] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: there are a _lot_ of navigation tests
[10:27:04] <johnbender> there's a fair amount of overlap
[10:27:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: we wait for the animations to complete too
[10:27:33] <johnbender> and there are quite a few complex navigation scenarios that we test
[10:27:39] <johnbender> that's where most of the time is
[10:27:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: looks like swarm isn't broken - just history - agree?
[10:28:03] <timmywil> gibson042: you tease
[10:28:17] <johnbender> we can turn off the animations for the phantom build but it seems to me that we should be testing them somewhere
[10:28:32] <johnbender> that is, the timing/event bindings
[10:28:50] <gnarf> johnbender: can you set duration on animations to like 10ms and get the same results?
[10:28:55] <johnbender> hopefully this issue will be resolved when we get a swarm server that can handle more than one executor
[10:29:02] <johnbender> gnarf: not automatically
[10:29:07] <johnbender> we'd have to change the css
[10:29:17] <johnbender> I could be mistaken about that though
[10:29:18] <gnarf> nvm then
[10:29:42] <gnarf> we can just deal with it and I'll light a bigger fire under clark/jzaefferer/krinkle to get us a new server ;)
[10:30:10] <johnbender> gnarf: yah, sorry that my response is "we need a bigger box" - that's super lame
[10:30:16] <clarkbox> my goal is to get it done this week
[10:30:17] <gnarf> johnbender: its true tho
[10:30:24] <gnarf> clarkbox: \o/
[10:30:29] <johnbender> I can always move the tests back over to the adobe box we had them on before :P
[10:30:32] <gnarf> clarkbox: lemme know if you need anything from me
[10:31:02] <clarkbox> as in‚Ä¶ before monday
[10:31:57] <clarkbox> will do. thanks. i am sure ill need a little puppet help
[10:32:09] <gnarf> hrm, why isn't IE6 launched @ swarm yet
[10:32:26] <clarkbox> did any of those puppet dudes who were helping out at the hackathon persist?
[10:33:08] <gnarf> clarkbox: none were really puppet guys - but ryanneufeld might be able to help out here and there, and the other guys were wordpress/automatic server guys
[10:34:17] <clarkbox> ok
[10:35:20] <gnarf> which i've got on my skype contacts now
[10:35:31] <gnarf> and can reach out to if we need, but i doubt they are gonna start lurkin the project
[10:36:51] <clarkbox> ya np. I'm sure we can handle it. ill just keep learning as i go.
[10:37:16] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:37:16] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Color build #51: FIXED in 3 min 17 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/51/
[10:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: confirm
[10:38:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well - i purged history - but I also made it work correctly again rather than timing out forever on timmy's broken commit ;) </passthebuck>
[10:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[10:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> LOOKS SO GOOD http://swarm.jquery.org/job/199
[10:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> crap, still get an effects failure http://swarm.jquery.org/job/201
[10:40:43] <gnarf> um
[10:40:46] <gnarf> in ie9?
[10:40:49] <gnarf> but not in ie7?
[10:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> apparently
[10:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps there were two different errors and I only fixed one of them.
[10:42:32] <gnarf> maybe - I'll look at it later today if you don't beat me to it
[10:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...effects failed in 1.6.2
[10:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason 1.6.2 wasn't in the list before. I assume jzaefferer just missed it when he was typing out the version numbers.
[10:43:28] <gnarf> yeah in opera
[10:43:43] <gnarf> that seems like a strange fail
[10:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it was just a typo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/7419a915b20b7fa4af8f8a33beaebda4a1e49a8d
[10:44:15] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery-ui by J√∂rn Zaefferer (3w, 2d ago): Grunt: Add all jQuery versions to test 1.9 beta against to testswarm-multi-jquery task
[10:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> Funny that the one version he missed has failures.
[10:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to look into all failures right now, so we'll see if I get this resolved before you get to it :-)
[10:45:32] <gnarf> ?glwt @scott_gonzalez
[10:45:32] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[10:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> All of those Opera fails are "Inline CSS Width has been reset after animation ended"
[10:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's not Opera, it must be a 1.6.2 bug
[10:51:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I wonder if we should extend the regular testswarm task to always test against latest and 1.7.2?
[10:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: By latest do you mean git?
[10:55:25] <gnarf> bbl
[10:59:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, something like that. I meant to write latest (aka 1.7.2) and -git
[11:08:54] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[11:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm not sure we need to run against -git on every commit.
[11:12:03] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yep
[11:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> At DevDays we discussed a cron job to run against -git once per day.
[11:12:13] <rwaldron> Yo
[11:12:18] <DaveMethvin> yoyo
[11:12:19] <rwaldron> i just posted to the thread
[11:12:30] <rwaldron> jsut the note about tbranyen's async:false
[11:12:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah i talked with tbranyen about that a while back
[11:12:35] <rwaldron> nbd
[11:12:44] <rwaldron> tbranyen didn't tell me that
[11:12:46] <DaveMethvin> no but possibly the tip of an iceberg
[11:12:56] <rwaldron> i'll booby trap his desk...
[11:13:01] <DaveMethvin> haha
[11:13:10] <tbranyen> O_O
[11:13:20] <DaveMethvin> IT'S A TRAP!
[11:13:26] <rwaldron> :D
[11:13:34] <rwaldron> booty-twaps
[11:13:40] <rwaldron> "booby traps"?
[11:13:48] <DaveMethvin> mmmm, booby
[11:13:53] <DaveMethvin> traps*
[11:13:56] <rwaldron> "yeah! thats what I said! booty-twaps"
[11:19:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we can set that up with Jenkins. Jobs can have a crontrigger instead of push notifications
[11:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Sounds good.
[11:21:19] <jzaefferer> we could add that cron trigger to the coverage job
[11:21:39] <jzaefferer> every two days, and manually whenever we want to?
[11:21:45] <jzaefferer> or just daily
[11:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> I was about to say "that sounds like overkill" but it's actually what we should be doing.
[11:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with daily, we can adjust if we think we should.
[11:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let's run at like 2:00a when no other tests are running :-)
[11:24:31] <jzaefferer> ha, okay
[11:24:48] <jzaefferer> let's see how to set the start time...
[11:25:27] <jzaefferer> There's a "@midnight" option
[11:25:31] <jzaefferer> that sounds good to me
[11:25:38] <jzaefferer> no fiddling with crazy cron lines
[11:26:07] <jzaefferer> let's try that for a start
[11:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We need to improve TestSwarm so that it doesn't constantly update the job page for finished jobs.
[11:26:38] <jzaefferer> yeah, my MBA fan starts spinning on that coverage page
[11:26:56] <jzaefferer> always a good sign of bad software :p
[11:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:28:31] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/213
[11:28:32] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #213 on testswarm (jzaefferer;  ago): Stop updating job page when done
[11:28:48] <jzaefferer> I wonder what timezone jenkins is in
[11:29:07] <jzaefferer> we probably don't want to have UTC midnight
[11:29:47] <jzaefferer> bash command for server time...?
[11:30:04] <jzaefferer> date!
[11:31:03] <jzaefferer> that says PDT
[11:31:18] <jzaefferer> but the time doesn't match what it shows on the jenkins web interface
[11:32:16] <jzaefferer> user.timezone GMT
[11:32:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what timezone do we want for midnight or 2am?
[11:33:04] <jzaefferer> How about PDT midnight?
[11:33:42] <scott_gonzalez> that works
[11:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Your comment is legit, but I couldn't resist.
[11:37:32] <DaveMethvin> lol scott_gonzalez
[11:38:02] <DaveMethvin> now who's getting me that pony?
[11:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We sent a request off to ECMA, so expect it in 2020...
[11:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if a carrier pidgeon can deliver a pony though.
[11:42:57] <rwaldron> haha
[11:42:57] <DaveMethvin> African or European?
[11:43:08] <rwaldron> don't worry... I bite back :D
[11:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> Leave it up to DaveMethvin to derail the subject with the first reply :-P
[11:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You should read the thread I linked to.
[11:44:58] <DaveMethvin> i take it you don't like ponies?
[11:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> I actually haven't been following the window.onerror discussion.
[11:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, I had it muted.
[11:46:54] <DaveMethvin> it would seem that as standards go, getting similar stack trace strings wouldn't be too hard
[11:47:01] <DaveMethvin> but it just goes to show what i know
[11:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Who knows when it comes to anonymous functions.
[11:57:36] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:error_stack looks good, and apparently the author also favors the Chrome/IE format
[11:58:01] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yes
[11:58:06] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: with that in place, what happens next?
[11:58:07] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #231: STILL FAILING in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/231/
[11:58:24] <rwaldron> Well, Erik had really good support for this the last time he brought it up
[11:58:41] <rwaldron> I will email it in to ensure it's on the agenda for july :)
[11:59:09] <rwaldron> (yes, we have to email stuff to a person who prepares the agenda)
[12:00:09] <jzaefferer> cool, that seems like pretty much what I was looking for
[12:00:35] <jzaefferer> next time I'll keep my initial mail short :p
[12:00:48] <rwaldron> jzaefferer dunzo
[12:00:53] <rwaldron> it's on the agenda now
[12:01:14] <rwaldron> TBH, I'm surprised it wasn't already *shrugs*
[12:01:49] <jzaefferer> alright, thanks
[12:01:58] <jzaefferer> when is the meeting?
[12:02:48] <rwaldron> July 24, 25, 26
[12:06:00] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: should we start a separate thread for the window.onerror stuff?
[12:06:48] <jzaefferer> PDT midnight is 7am GMT, right?
[12:07:06] <jzaefferer> whatever that is in a cron tab...
[12:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: possibly, might be 8am.. PDT vs. PST confuses me.
[12:07:56] <ajpiano> ?time greenwich, uk
[12:07:58] <bot-t> ajpiano, greenwich, uk - Weather: Cloudy, 18∞C / 64∞F
[12:08:05] <ajpiano> #fail
[12:08:20] <gnarf> yeah time doesn't work
[12:08:23] <jzaefferer> I'm on PDT (I think) currently, and Jenkins claims to be on GMT, 7pm right now
[12:08:33] <jzaefferer> that's seven hours difference
[12:08:34] <gnarf> yeah, should be 19:00 GMT currently
[12:08:42] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yeah, makes sense to do that
[12:08:57] <ajpiano> jzaefferer:
[12:08:59] <ajpiano> http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/difference-between-London-and-Los%20Angeles.php
[12:09:12] <rwaldron> Also, I'd like to nominate scott_gonzalez as a w3c rep for jQuery
[12:09:23] <rwaldron> (someone second this please)
[12:09:42] <DaveMethvin> how does this affect my pony rwaldron?
[12:10:02] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez is a pony trainer extraordinaire
[12:10:16] <DaveMethvin> okay then he has my vote
[12:10:33] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I don't get this cron mumbo jumbo - need a line that causes it to run once each day at 7am
[12:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Is that like a global rep or something? I'm already a rep for a few WGs.
[12:11:21] <jzaefferer> 01 8 * * *
[12:11:30] <jzaefferer> that should run at 8:01 each day
[12:11:37] <jzaefferer>  so..
[12:11:41] <jzaefferer> 00 7 * * *
[12:11:47] <jzaefferer> James Bond time!
[12:12:04] <DaveMethvin> i like my cron jobs shaken, not stirred
[12:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: correct
[12:12:41] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i think it just means you attend the meetings and be the official pontiff representing us
[12:12:59] <jzaefferer> The official pony?
[12:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: But are there general W3C meetings?
[12:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> Each WG has their own schedule.
[12:13:33] <DaveMethvin> i don't know i've never been invited to a w3c meeting
[12:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/2W3f2h3t3L3Z41203u3A
[12:20:36] <gnarf> 00 7 * * * <---
[12:21:07] <gnarf> * 7 * * * would run every minute during the 7am hour of each day ;)
[12:21:46] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin thanks for the tip! http://gyazo.com/9b44e566dad207a701f0c07a55d80498
[12:22:05] <DaveMethvin> great hookers!
[12:23:38] <Gho5t> DaveMethvin: I'd like to contribute. I read how to get started online and it makes it seem like you first need to submit a bug and then fix said bug.
[12:23:51] <Gho5t> If you wish to contribute code to jQuery core please make sure you've first filed a bug report detailing your specific bug or feature request."
[12:24:05] <DaveMethvin> Gho5t: well, we have lots of existing bugs as well, so don't feel like you have to find new ones :D
[12:24:23] <Gho5t> ok so I just pick one out and submit a fix?
[12:24:30] <DaveMethvin> but yeah if you want to get started it's good to find a "simple" one to fix
[12:24:37] <DaveMethvin> we can help you out on that
[12:24:42] <Gho5t> that sounds great
[12:25:28] <DaveMethvin> there's a lot of getting started stuff, learning the process and style guide, that kind of thing, so don't be frustrated if it takes a while
[12:25:38] <Gho5t> ok
[12:41:24] <gnarf> bot-t: tell mikesherov um - whats with the non-px animation test failing in Firefox? http://swarm.jquery.org/result/42662
[12:41:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[12:43:31] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I mean, you speak as a member of jQuery Foundation who is a member of w3c
[12:43:37] <rwaldron> I can't stand those people
[12:43:58] <rwaldron> you're way better at working with them then I am
[12:46:01] <scott_gonzalez>  I do in fact speak on behalf of jQuery Foundation for the W3C.
[12:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> It was actually quite messy when we joined, because the W3C software doesn't understand the concept of someone becoming a member of an organization.
[12:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> So as soon as I was associated with jQuery Foundation I was dropped from groups that I was already participating in.
[12:49:58] <rwaldron> oh wow
[12:50:12] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez so, that's awesome, I was actually not aware of that
[12:50:20] <rwaldron> but the news makes me happy!
[12:50:27] <rwaldron> so...
[12:50:35] <rwaldron> window.onerror is all yours <3
[12:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> HAH
[12:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> The current discussion is on WHATWG :-P
[12:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> NO REPS!
[12:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can track the discussion though.
[12:51:35] <rwaldron> hahaha
[12:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll unmute.
[12:51:39] <rwaldron> wamp-wamp
[12:51:55] <scott_gonzalez> Though I don't think it's an active discussion.
[12:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> I moved it back to my inbox to read through the discussion.
[12:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've also seen complaints from members that work for browser vendors, because they cannot join a group as an individual.
[12:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> If they join a WG and they're associated with a company (like Google or Apple), then they're assumed to be representing the company.
[12:56:45] <rwaldron> annoying.

[18:24:41] <mikesherov> it's failing because backgroundPositionX is the dumbest css property
[18:25:35] <mikesherov> david_mark: tell DaveMethvin that jquery is dumb and everyone involved is dumb, and sizzle sucks, and did I mention jquery sucks
[18:25:35] <david_mark> mikesherov, I‚Äôll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[18:25:44] <DaveMethvin> hey
[18:25:44] <david_mark> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, just say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.

[18:25:51] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:25:58] <mikesherov> awesome
[18:27:34] <mikesherov> wow, chrome is finally going to fix this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29084
[18:27:52] <mikesherov> looks like I won't need to shim top/left/bottom/right to always return percentage
[18:28:19] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: damn, that will be sweet
[18:28:34] <DaveMethvin> you won;t have to do it yourself
[18:28:39] <mikesherov> sure
[18:28:46] <mikesherov> and I can get rid of the position hack I had in place
[18:28:51] <mikesherov> I just added that is
[18:30:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah, maybe remove in 1.9, since they haven't even landed their fix i guess
[18:31:10] <DaveMethvin> working on the release notes, but let me run and land that patch before it needs more rebasing
[18:31:35] <mikesherov> great, thanks
[18:31:55] <mikesherov> let me know if you need any input from me regarding .ready or css3 or border-box
[18:34:33] <mikesherov> http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/CSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp this file makes me wonder how any browsers ever work at all

[18:48:05] <mikesherov> I'm predicting between 6 and 10 in IE8

[18:53:47] <Krinkle> just log in as jquery and click "delete"
[18:53:47] <DaveMethvin> NOW you tell him :D
[18:53:58] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:54:05] <Krinkle> :P
[18:54:18] <mikesherov> Krinkle, so these IE8 fails are killing me
[18:54:42] <Krinkle> mikesherov: the ones related to position?
[18:54:46] <mikesherov> Can you walk me through exactly how the environment for these test runs are set up? If you could be so kind?
[18:54:49] <mikesherov> yeah, those
[18:54:57] <Krinkle> that has to do with IE being incapable of measuring inside an iframe properly
[18:55:06] <mikesherov> Oh, well ladedah
[18:55:12] <mikesherov> how can I replicate?
[18:55:24] <mikesherov> or do you have a link to something explaining the issue?
[18:55:38] <Krinkle> No, I didn't introduce nor found out about the bug
[18:55:47] <Krinkle> I just know that it does that so I've been told
[18:55:52] <DaveMethvin> i can't repro it locally tho
[18:55:52] <mikesherov> I see
[18:55:55] <mikesherov> and who told you?
[18:55:58] <DaveMethvin> it's something to do with swarm
[18:56:01] <Krinkle> mikesherov: create an html file in jqueyr/jquery/test and embed index.html
[18:56:03] <Krinkle> that should replicate it
[18:56:07] <mikesherov> I did that
[18:56:10] <mikesherov> didn't :-\
[18:56:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah it didn't repro for me either
[18:56:24] <Krinkle> try applying testswarm css to the parent frame
[18:56:32] <Krinkle> and loading inject.js inside the frame
[18:56:33] <mikesherov> link to the css?
[18:56:35] <Krinkle> like testrunner
[18:56:41] <Krinkle> see testrunner.js in jquery/test
[18:56:51] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[18:56:53] <Krinkle> just append ?swarmURL or something like that to the parent window url
[18:56:56] <Krinkle> that'll trigger that part
[18:57:00] <Krinkle> (if that's relevant)
[18:57:26] <Krinkle> <link rel=stylesheet> from view-source:http://swarm.jquery.org
[18:57:28] <mikesherov> whatever will get me to repro the environment the tests are run in...
[18:57:45] <Krinkle> But all that aside
[18:57:50] <Krinkle> repro may not help
[18:57:52] <Krinkle> then what?
[18:57:57] <mikesherov> well, then find a fix
[18:58:07] <mikesherov> rather than stab in the dark and pray :-D
[18:58:27] <DaveMethvin> so Krinkle the testswarm.css has the offending styles?
[18:58:29] <mikesherov> and correct the testswarm css so it doesn't muck with our test environment
[18:58:29] <DaveMethvin> which ones are they?
[18:58:32] <Krinkle> according to jzaefferer these tests could be removed or otherwise written to still test the same functionality without hitting this bug
[18:58:40] <mikesherov> Krinkle: sure
[18:58:46] <mikesherov> we could just remove the tests
[18:58:50] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: mikesherov I don't know, for all I know it is triggered by the letter combination 'jq' in the ur.
[18:58:50] <mikesherov> not really the point though
[18:59:12] <Krinkle> loading css in the parent frame might simulate more of the environment, could be related.
[18:59:15] <DaveMethvin> oh, the url has it in for us? :D just as i thought
[18:59:27] <mikesherov> I'd like to understand how it's specifically munging the test environment so I can be confident in the test suite
[19:00:24] <mikesherov> so Krinkle, if I do this:  	document.write("<scr" + "ipt src='http://swarm.jquery.org/js/inject.js?" + (new Date).getTime() + "'></scr" + "ipt>");
[19:00:54] <mikesherov> into a page, that'll repro the environment?
[19:01:10] <Krinkle> mikesherov: define environmenet
[19:01:32] <mikesherov> yeah, I can't
[19:01:42] <mikesherov> what I mean is, I want to local repro the fails
[19:01:46] <Krinkle> mikesherov: TestSwarm doesn't run tests, it just distributes them to clients which put the url in an iframe, and thats it
[19:01:46] <Krinkle> there is no muning from testswarm pov
[19:01:47] <Krinkle> it just 'does' it and then somehow ie7 doesn't do it
[19:01:53] <Krinkle> of course
[19:01:58] <Krinkle> I've been trying that for weeks :P
[19:02:13] <mikesherov> I'm just trying to brainstorm
[19:02:17] <Krinkle> Please do :)
[19:02:18] <DaveMethvin> maybe jzaefferer can give us an easy workaround, but i actually put in some workarounds for a couple of cases and they were complete hacks
[19:02:29] <mikesherov> yeah, I just want a repro
[19:02:34] <DaveMethvin> i just didn't see any easy fix other than pulling all the tests out
[19:02:43] <DaveMethvin> which would be kind of scary
[19:03:16] <mikesherov> OK, so I also could just append swarmURL to the text index?
[19:03:16] <DaveMethvin> i would like to know the conditions that trigger it, and they definitely have something to do with the way testswarm is running
[19:03:20] <Krinkle> but really testing from inside an iframe is bound to fail at some point. It is simply not a realistic environment. It is nice to make stuff work there too, but not useful as the main test environment.
[19:03:20] <Krinkle> The long term solution is to implement a more client-controlling system in TestSwarm that makes it so we can route the swarm client to a page and then back to the swarm. This is a being feature request that will be worked on at some point.
[19:03:35] <mikesherov> Krinkle: I'm with you
[19:03:41] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Yes, most definitely. But I don't know what it is that triggers it
[19:03:44] <mikesherov> but I'd also like to know, for myself, the IE8 bug that causes this
[19:04:21] <Krinkle> mikesherov: Sure, appending that to a non-frames jquery test suite will include inject.js
[19:04:28] <Krinkle> which is part of the environment
[19:05:04] <mikesherov> So, I have http://localhost:8888/jquery/test/?swarmURL=
[19:05:18] <mikesherov> and that'll load up inject.js, which does what exactly?
[19:05:22] <Krinkle> mikesherov: something else you could do: Install Testswarm locally, go to ./run/Example, then use the inspector to strip the dom a bit and inject your own iframe to localhost/jquery/test/index.html?swarmURL=http://swarm.local.dev
[19:05:36] <Krinkle> mikesherov: it registers a QUnit hook
[19:05:53] <Krinkle> when QUnit is done, it tries to contact the parent frame which then makes an ajax request to store the requests
[19:06:10] <mikesherov> I see... at what point is the testswarm css loaded up?

[19:06:19] <Krinkle> mikesherov: its not
[19:06:32] <Krinkle> mikesherov: there is no css being loaded inside the frame by testswamr
[19:06:36] <Krinkle> just injec.tjs
[19:06:46] <mikesherov> <Krinkle> try applying testswarm css to the parent frame
[19:06:50] <mikesherov> how do I do that?
[19:07:00] <Krinkle> mikesherov: *parent frame*
[19:07:05] <Krinkle> i.e. testswarm itself
[19:07:22] <mikesherov> Right, so that's what I'm after
[19:07:40] <Krinkle> mikesherov: just install testswarm and use the inspector to create your iframe in there, instead of the other way around
[19:07:44] <Krinkle> will save a LOT of time
[19:07:51] <Krinkle> or even use swarm.jquery.org
[19:07:56] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/sandbox
[19:08:03] <Krinkle> dump the error element, put in an ifram
[19:08:06] <mikesherov> testswarm itself loads up an iframe that contains the test suite with swarmURL, which loads up inject.js
[19:08:09] <mikesherov> got it
[19:08:22] <Krinkle> yep
[19:08:28] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/OoDtuQ
[19:08:28] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update Sizzle: compress/edge case pull from gibson and a fix :not/:has with spaces - Timmy Willison
[19:08:47] <mikesherov> so in this sandbox you've given me, I can just create my own iframe
[19:08:53] <Krinkle> and inject.js looks at swarmURL to know where the testswarm is installed (since it could be on a different domain potentially)
[19:09:03] <Krinkle> mikesherov: yes sir
[19:09:27] <mikesherov> what is the IFRAME code as created when a run happens?
[19:10:07] <Krinkle> mikesherov: can you rephrase that?
[19:10:49] <mikesherov> ok, so I'm almost there, I just need to put an iframe on this page
[19:10:57] * Krinkle is in a jet lagged mode after a day that has been artificially expanded with 8 hours - but not tired.
[19:11:12] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org/sandbox <-- I need to add an iframe there with an inspector
[19:11:27] <mikesherov> with chrome dev tools, etc.
[19:11:43] <Krinkle> mikesherov: yes
[19:11:43] <Krinkle> mikesherov: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js#L156
[19:11:48] <Krinkle> regular iframe, but just in case its special, ^ is the code
[19:12:40] <mikesherov> Cool, thanks
[19:12:53] <mikesherov> I append an iframe to #iframes
[19:13:00] <mikesherov> great
[19:13:01] <Krinkle> that won't exist on /sandbox
[19:13:09] <Krinkle> just append to body or whatever
[19:13:17] <mikesherov> ok
[19:13:23] <Krinkle> or create #iframes
[19:13:26] <mikesherov> but rest is the same... add the same classes, etc.
[19:13:37] <Krinkle> (jQuery fails silently when appending to a null element - I hate that personally)
[19:14:00] <Krinkle> expect to get some exceptions or 404 errors though since the test results of this will be rejected but the API (Hopefully)
[19:14:11] <Krinkle> by the API*

[19:15:56] <mikesherov> Krinkle, and I can do the same thing by locally installing testswarm?
[19:16:10] <Krinkle> sure
[19:16:24] <Krinkle> might be slightly overkill, but should work fine
[19:16:37] <Krinkle> clone repo, use README.md
[19:16:58] <mikesherov> Well, not overkill, because I need to save my changes and then open them in IE8
[19:17:22] <Krinkle> then use localhost/testswarm/signup to create a user (e.g. "jquery") then then to do testswarm/addjob to create the job
[19:17:43] <Krinkle> you can reset the job from the job page after each change, no need to create new jobs - which is nice :)
[19:18:53] <mikesherov> I just want to get to a page where I can see the resulting iframe that runs the testsuite
[19:19:42] <mikesherov> is there a url you can point me to that does that?
[19:20:04] <mikesherov> I essentially just want to open that page in IE8 over and over again to see the fail for myself.
[19:20:06] <Krinkle> no
[19:20:14] <Krinkle> well, yes.
[19:20:35] <Krinkle> if you install it locally you can go to localhos/testswarm/run/mike in your IE8 and have it fail
[19:20:48] <Krinkle> then you can click "reset" on testswarm/job/1 and do it again if you want
[19:22:05] <mikesherov> great!

[19:50:26] <mikesherov> So I installed testswarm locally
[19:50:40] <mikesherov> then I signed up as user jquery
[19:50:49] <Krinkle> ok
[19:51:01] <Krinkle> need anything?
[19:51:17] <mikesherov> then I went to /addjob, and added a job called "mike" who's run url was: localhost/jquery/test/?filter=offset
[19:51:37] <mikesherov> what next?
[19:54:30] <mikesherov> success
[19:54:31] <mikesherov> !
[19:54:53] <mikesherov> then I just opened localhost/testswarm/run/mike in IE8!
[19:55:05] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I was able to repro
[19:55:23] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[19:55:33] <DaveMethvin> now, we just have to fix
[19:55:42] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking
[19:55:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe it's the frameborder?
[19:55:56] <mikesherov> Krinkle, how do I reset the test?
[19:56:22] <Krinkle> mikesherov: are you logged in?
[19:56:28] <mikesherov> yup
[19:56:29] <Krinkle> go to user/jquery
[19:56:32] <Krinkle> click the job
[19:56:33] <Krinkle> then reset
[19:56:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah and don't edit the database! :D
[19:56:53] <Krinkle> .rrrright
[19:56:56] <DaveMethvin> afaik there is no way to remove the frameborder in IE with CSS .. you have to put frameborder=0 in the markup
[19:57:03] <mikesherov> great
[19:58:00] <mikesherov> OK, krinkle, can you point me to the testswarm code that creates the iframe in /run/<job-name>
[19:58:33] <DaveMethvin> is this it? https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js#L156
[19:58:42] <Krinkle> yes
[19:58:46] <DaveMethvin> yay
[20:00:21] <mikesherov> frameborder not it
[20:00:27] <DaveMethvin> :(
[20:00:32] <mikesherov> I did iframe.frameborder=0;
[20:00:44] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i am not sure that is the same
[20:00:52] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[20:01:15] <mikesherov> iframe.frameBorder = "no";
