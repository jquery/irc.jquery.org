[06:17:54] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[06:18:06] <timmywil> rwaldron: sup dawg
[06:18:10] <rwaldron> hey dude
[06:18:25] <rwaldron> so, funny that this was brought up...
[06:18:26] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3ad0ba62f03ff3d7aec7d3dfb25492cdf33350a7#commitcomment-669572
[06:18:27] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by timmywil (1w, 5d ago): Do not call getElements on a script tag. Avoids unnecessary execution. Fixes #10176.
[06:18:42] <rwaldron> regarding "using strict comparison causes the function to be executed in IE"
[06:19:00] <rwaldron> I was trying to relate this to someone at Bocoup the other day
[06:19:06] <rwaldron> and he thought I was insane
[06:19:36] <rwaldron> I've been trying find documentation, examples or _anything_
[06:19:37] <timmywil> hehe, yea. i actually learned about it from john.  It sounded crazy when I heard it too.
[06:19:58] <rwaldron> I learned about it from snover, thought he was talking crazy-talk
[06:20:24] <timmywil> lemme see if i can put together a test case
[06:20:30] <rwaldron> so, I want to whip up a demo the illustrates...
[06:20:32] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:20:32] <rwaldron> nice
[06:20:34] <timmywil> it's hard to repro
[06:21:01] <rwaldron> i've been trying to figure out a way to do so for about 20 mins
[06:21:07] <timmywil> but I did see it happen when I wrote that findInputs stuff in manip
[06:21:51] <rwaldron> i ran into it during the clone() rewrite
[06:22:10] <rwaldron> but i'm trying to pinpoint exactly the single point in which it occurs
[06:22:15] <rwaldron> and how to repro only that
[06:23:35] <timmywil> rwaldron: hmmm, just noticed something https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0c2d1aee5421b650159116b6bdcb74a4fe96f9ad

[06:32:22] <rwaldron> No love?
[06:32:59] <timmywil> yea, working on a couple things at once
[06:33:34] <rwaldron> no... NOW.
[06:33:36] <rwaldron> :)

[06:34:29] <timmywil> boosh
[06:35:31] <rwaldron> um
[06:35:52] <rwaldron> timmywil what is the expected output?
[06:36:04] <timmywil> rwaldron: IE6 throws an error
[06:36:13] <timmywil> only one "true"
[06:36:18] <rwaldron> that's what i thought...
[06:36:20] <rwaldron> wtf.
[06:36:23] <rwaldron> OH
[06:36:24] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:36:26] <rwaldron> whoops
[06:36:30] <rwaldron> noooothing
[06:36:44] * rwaldron switches browserstack to test in IE6.. duh.
[06:36:45] <timmywil> er, wait
[06:36:54] <timmywil> only one true is fine
[06:37:00] <timmywil> still throws an error tho
[06:37:20] <timmywil> and yea, IE6 :P
[06:38:20] <timmywil> hmmmmm, i don't see it in browserstack
[06:38:25] <rwaldron> yeaaaahhhh
[06:38:27] <timmywil> ugh
[06:38:28] <rwaldron> nor do i
[06:38:32] <rwaldron> which scares me

[06:39:46] <timmywil> strange, mine still errors
[06:40:46] <rwaldron> I'm emailing
[06:40:47] <rwaldron> Ritesh Arora <ritesh@browserstack.com>
[06:40:55] <rwaldron> Just a quick question regarding IE6, 7, 8 installs - Are these installed on the same machine on your end by any chance? (Or is there any way that you know of that they might be sharing DLLs?)
[06:40:59] <rwaldron> Anything else?
[06:41:07] <rwaldron> or suggestions for edits?
[06:43:24] <timmywil> good question.  I'll try some more examples and see if I can get it failing in browserstack.
[06:44:05] <rwaldron> Should i send this off as is?
[06:44:08] <rwaldron> timmywil: ^
[06:44:16] <timmywil> sounds good to me
[06:44:52] <rwaldron> cc'ing timmywillisn@gmail.com,
[06:45:05] <timmywil> rwaldron: thanks!
[06:51:47] <rwaldron> timmywil have you ever looked at/played with Traceur?
[06:52:09] <rwaldron> I found this over the weekend and I've been poking through the traceur code
[06:52:11] <rwaldron> http://css.dzone.com/articles/future-javascript-today
[06:52:17] <timmywil> rwaldron: i haven't
[06:52:35] <rwaldron> Alex Russell gave a talk about it at JSConf earlier this year
[06:52:47] <rwaldron> it occurred to me that this was the foundation for the Dart "VM"
[06:53:04] <rwaldron> (as it appears when compiled to JS)
[06:53:14] <rwaldron> anyway, interesting stuff to study
[06:53:39] <timmywil> oh, this sounds cool
[06:53:40] <miketaylr> that's the first thing i've heard about traceur since that talk
[06:53:46] <miketaylr> didn't seem to take off
[06:53:54] <rwaldron> it's amazing how well suited to language implementation JavaScript really is
[06:54:24] <rwaldron> miketaylr i think itdidnt take off because it was actually Dart
[06:54:47] <miketaylr> i mean uptake from the community
[06:54:58] <miketaylr> it may be used by dart, i have no idea
[06:55:03] <miketaylr> but it would make sense
[06:55:10] <miketaylr> well, parts of it
[06:55:17] <rwaldron> parts yeah
[06:55:22] <rwaldron> compare...
[06:55:23] <rwaldron> http://www.dartlang.org/docs/getting-started/class.html
[06:55:30] <rwaldron> http://css.dzone.com/articles/future-javascript-today
[06:55:37] <rwaldron> look for the class named "Greeter"
[06:55:42] <miketaylr> heh
[06:55:43] <rwaldron> in the second link
[06:56:15] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron timmywil
[06:56:20] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin
[06:56:23] <miketaylr> i'm still waiting for the dart google wave API
[06:56:31] <DaveMethvin> hey miketaylr
[06:56:35] <miketaylr> hey
[06:56:43] <rwaldron> also, i read about http://opalang.org/learn.xmlt
[06:56:46] <rwaldron> this weekend...
[06:56:47] <timmywil> hi DaveMethvin !
[06:56:57] <rwaldron> very bizarre
[06:56:59] <DaveMethvin> so, i have some stuff that needs to go in today, i marked a couple of tickets as blockers
[07:01:26] <rwaldron> wtf...
[07:01:37] <rwaldron> it seems that I'm not getting bug reports emailed to me??
[07:02:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: yea, we've been having an issue with our notifications
[07:02:55] <rwaldron> :O!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:03:03] <rwaldron> I hate that!
[07:03:07] <DaveMethvin> ?10558
[07:03:09] <bot-t> [#10558] Test Support bug (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10558
[07:03:45] <DaveMethvin> It looked to me like that should have been lastChild
[07:04:05] <DaveMethvin> but i wondered if anyone else knew more about the code
[07:05:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: nice catch, i think that used to be just after div.innerHTML = ""
[07:06:48] <timmywil> so yes, that should be lastChild
[07:08:00] <rwaldron> yeah, i just sanity checked that
[07:08:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's funny b/c some random person seemed to be reading the code and found it?
[07:08:23] <DaveMethvin> yay random people!
[07:09:12] <timmywil> aww, they're like dwarves
[07:09:23] <timmywil> wait, what
[07:11:36] <rwaldron> weird...
[07:11:51] <rwaldron> the firstChild is always text node
[07:12:07] <timmywil> makes sense
[07:12:22] <timmywil> up top, innerHTML = "   </link..."
[07:13:17] <rwaldron> yeah, sorry that was a fragmented thought
[07:13:38] <rwaldron> i'm just wondering how/why/wtf that was "working"
[07:13:49] <rwaldron> as in, it wasnt?
[07:14:01] <DaveMethvin> well it got a boolean value for the support.checkClone
[07:14:09] <DaveMethvin> just not a useful or correct one :P
[07:14:13] <rwaldron> right
[07:14:22] <timmywil> I guess it was always false, so it was always doing the extra work
[07:14:57] <timmywil> rwaldron: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/NzUKW/8/
[07:15:02] <timmywil> THERE we go
[07:15:29] <timmywil> hehe, i just threw all of the test suite html in there, could probably narrow it down
[07:15:52] <rwaldron> yeah...
[07:15:53] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:17:11] <rwaldron> timmywil no dice
[07:17:18] <rwaldron> works fine in IE6

[07:54:48] <timmywil> see above
[07:54:51] <rwaldron> looking
[07:55:13] <timmywil> "wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignment"
[07:55:19] <timmywil> that's the fun error
[08:04:24] <gnarf> .
[08:04:25] <bot-t> (3 hours 41 mins ago) <addyosmani> tell gnarf if you could let me know when you're around I'd like to check on one of the needsdocs before I write them up.
[08:23:23] <addyosmani> Hey DaveMethvin
[08:23:50] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani
[08:23:58] <gnarf> hey addyosmani you wanted to chat?
[08:24:45] <addyosmani> hey gnarf!
[08:24:49] <addyosmani> yes :)
[08:25:09] <addyosmani> So I was looking over the needsdocs for namespaced data on $.data()/$.fn.data()
[08:25:22] <addyosmani> and I noticed that it said the current behaviour would be deprecated
[08:25:25] <addyosmani> then removed.
[08:25:37] <addyosmani> I was wondering if I could get a clarification on that
[08:25:44] <addyosmani> are we completely dropping support for namespaced keys
[08:25:51] <addyosmani> or are we patching so its consistent?
[08:26:14] <addyosmani> across both .data()/.fn.data()
[08:29:02] <timmywil> i don't think we can remove
[08:29:18] <timmywil> oh, namespaced keys
[08:29:19] <timmywil> yes
[08:29:26] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #134: STILL FAILING in 6 min 44 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/134/
[08:29:27] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Don't run direct handlers if delegate did .stopPropagation().
[08:29:27] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Make event.currentTarget the delegate node, always.
[08:29:28] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Don't add an empty list of handlers.
[08:29:28] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Fold dispatch function into main event dispatch.
[08:29:29] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Make jQuery().off(event) work for delegated events.
[08:29:29] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Stop global event bubbling using onlyHandlers flag.
[08:29:30] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Fix #10563. Ensure event.currentTarget==this if delegated.
[08:30:10] <gnarf> addyosmani: so, currently there is some undocumented behavior with regards to using a "." in the key for .fn.data()
[08:30:15] <gnarf> it only affects .fn.data()
[08:30:22] <timmywil> addyosmani: support for namespaced data keys has been sparse since the beginning
[08:30:33] <timmywil> it ain't real namespaces
[08:30:39] <addyosmani> oh of course
[08:30:43] <gnarf> but it tries ;)
[08:30:45] <gnarf> so
[08:30:47] <gnarf> behavior
[08:30:59] <addyosmani> I guess my concern was it didn't appear clear whether we wanted to totally remove support (the sparse support we have now) or actually fix
[08:31:21] <gnarf> we want to remove any special behavior around "." in the data key
[08:31:40] <gnarf> so currently
[08:32:01] <timmywil> but was this documented anywhere?
[08:32:05] <gnarf> .data("foo.bar") will trigger a getData.foo event, and .data("foo.bar", test) will trigger a setData.foo event
[08:32:08] <gnarf> timmywil: no
[08:32:22] <addyosmani> timmywil: this is something we're going to doc soon
[08:32:27] <gnarf> if we want to deprecate it though, we should probably doc it
[08:32:32] <addyosmani> Okay
[08:32:52] <addyosmani> gnarf I think that clears up my question
[08:32:52] <timmywil> wait, we want to add docs for a feature that was never fully supported just so we can deprecate and remove it?
[08:32:58] <gnarf> addyosmani: also .data("foo.bar") will return .data("foo") if .data("foo.bar") is undefined
[08:33:07] <gnarf> addyosmani: thats what the original "bug" was about
[08:33:21] <timmywil> that doesn't make sense to me
[08:33:32] <addyosmani> timmywil: someone previously posted a ticket asking about support and saying X and Y (with namespaced keys) worked in some situations but not others
[08:33:41] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/XIG7qg
[08:33:41] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix 10558. Get the right element for checkClone; thanks zhengzongyi! - Dave Methvin
[08:33:43] <addyosmani> so I guess for the very few people that do currently use it documented just to deprecate makes sense
[08:34:14] <gnarf> timmywil: i thought that was the conclusion you me and DaveMethvin reached when we talked about this ticket
[08:34:30] <gnarf> docs#10544
[08:34:31] <bot-t> [#10544]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10544
[08:34:37] <timmywil> I'm all for deprecating, but adding the docs seems to say we are adding support
[08:34:43] <DaveMethvin> it is my hope that few people use it
[08:35:07] <gnarf> timmywil: how else to we announce a deprecation without documenting the behavior we are deprecating
[08:35:07] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #135: STILL FAILING in 1 min 18 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/135/
[08:35:08] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Fix 10558. Get the right element for checkClone; thanks zhengzongyi!
[08:35:17] <DaveMethvin> right now data names with dots act screwy, i think that is the issue
[08:35:23] <timmywil> gnarf: a blog post saying we are removing something that was never documented
[08:35:38] <timmywil> and HOW on earth do you document this?
[08:35:39] <DaveMethvin> well stranger things have happened :)
[08:36:11] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking wed just tell ppl to avoid names with dots, not to describe the bizarre behavior
[08:36:24] <timmywil> something to that effect yea
[08:36:36] <gnarf> "We will document the current (deprecated) behavior - and then set it up for removal in 1.8."
[08:36:39] <addyosmani> I was thinking of something on a smaller scale timmywil. i.e: Prior to jQuery 1.7, so and so was the behaviour with namespaced keys. This will be deprecated in this release and not be supported in jQuery 1.8 onwards etc.
[08:36:59] <timmywil> addyosmani: that makes sense
[08:37:14] <DaveMethvin> i mean, if ppl want a namespace they should add an object to .data() and namespace to their heart's content
[08:37:18] <timmywil> but adding _documention_ is going overboard
[08:37:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah if we describe it, no matter how bizarre, ppl will say , "Hey neat i could use that'
[08:37:43] <gnarf> we don't need to get overly detailed about the brokenness of the events
[08:37:49] <addyosmani> you think it would make more sense as a post rather than a note in docs?.
[08:37:51] <timmywil> i don't this to be a documented feature.  then it's a bigger deal to deprecate it.
[08:37:57] <timmywil> want*
[08:38:15] <addyosmani> i mean, i dont mind writing either, but I'd feel like a blog post would be a greater acknowledgement about this stuff
[08:38:31] <timmywil> well, we can make it part of the 1.7 release post
[08:38:39] <addyosmani> I think that makes sense
[08:38:42] <DaveMethvin> sounds okay
[08:38:48] <gnarf> "Using data keys that have a "." in them in jQuery 1.7 and below can cause some strange behaviors.  These strange behaviors are being deprecated and will be removed in 1.8."
[08:39:09] <DaveMethvin> "the management apologizes for any inconvenience"
[08:39:16] <JohnResig> fwiw http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/#11
[08:39:22] <timmywil> what you think
[08:39:26] <addyosmani> lol DaveMethvin
[08:39:52] <DaveMethvin> well JohnResig we never really documented it
[08:40:21] <addyosmani> I think we should just add notes to #10544 about adding this to the release post. In reflection, it does make more sense being mentioned there rather than in the docs.
[08:40:22] <JohnResig> sure - but as was the case with .data('events') I talked about it a ton
[08:40:58] <DaveMethvin> i guess it's a question of how widely used this stuff is, and what kind of pain it causes to deprecate
[08:41:33] <gnarf> JohnResig: the behaviors surrounding the "namespaced data" are tricky and confusing
[08:41:40] <DaveMethvin> the impression i got from wycats is that he was up for a spring cleaning in an  upcoming version, and i would like to do that as well
[08:42:05] <DaveMethvin> we should make a big list of stuff going into 1.8 that we feel can be deprecated/removed/pluginned
[08:42:12] <gnarf> its not clear why .data("foo.bar") returns .data("foo") for example
[08:42:14] <addyosmani> Happy to assist with any docs related to that effort DaveMethvin.
[08:42:32] <JohnResig> gnarf: it has the same semantics as namespaced events
[08:42:43] <gnarf> JohnResig: actually it doesn't :)
[08:42:44] <addyosmani> btw, I don't know how well the regex on google code search works, but we could try locating any samples using namespaced keys that way
[08:42:52] <gnarf> .removeData(".namespace") doesn't do what you'd expect
[08:42:59] <addyosmani> as i recall, that was used as a justification for the isNAN/Numeric stuff.
[08:43:02] <gnarf> also, namespaced events are still fired from "standard" events
[08:43:13] <timmywil> same semantics, not real namespaces
[08:43:47] <JohnResig> gnarf: namespaced events firing from standard events is expected
[08:43:52] <gnarf> also, this data events stuff fires "exclusive" events which is also confusing
[08:44:45] <DaveMethvin> i think data events are the only place we use exclusive, at least i've never seen it used elsewhere and we don't document it externally
[08:45:19] <gnarf> JohnResig: having .data("foo.bar") return .data("foo") when undefined also seems unexpected
[08:45:41] <gnarf> and not at all semantically similar to event namespaces
[08:46:03] <JohnResig> it's unfortunate that we did such a poor job documenting all those event changes from that release
[08:46:24] <DaveMethvin> well data events in particular are difficult to document because their semantics are so strange
[08:46:36] <gnarf> JohnResig: i was looking for the trac ticket that defined this behavior too, do you happen to know where it is?
[08:47:20] <JohnResig> not sure
[08:48:06] <timmywil> what does exclusive mean again?  fire getData.foo, but not getData?
[08:48:25] <gnarf> timmywil: yeah, although if you trigger "getData.foo" i believe it already does that
[08:48:33] <gnarf> its more fire "getData" without firing "getData.foo"
[08:50:30] <gnarf> which - yet again - breaks events semantics :)
[08:51:43] <timmywil> i guess that kinda makes sense, but seems like feature creep
[08:52:46] <gnarf> i might be a little late for -meeting, but ill be there
[08:52:48] <gnarf> afk a bit
[09:01:18] <DaveMethvin> matjas: on http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size could you leave out the normal size in the graph? it makes the important numbers easier to see
[09:29:37] <timmywil> http://goo.gl/tQZrq unreviewed tickets
[09:39:33] <gnarf> hrm
[09:40:27] <gnarf> i bet you we could really make an interesting project for some datavis guy
[09:40:40] <gnarf> with the size of jquery per commit
[09:40:41] <gnarf> :)
[09:54:47] <addyosmani> ask matjas to do it :p
[10:30:38] <matjas> DaveMethvin: did you read the disclaimer?
[10:30:41] <matjas> ‚ÄúThis page aims to demonstrate the importance of HTTP compression and minification.‚Äù
[10:31:21] <paul_irish> what page
[10:31:28] <paul_irish> o rite
[10:33:23] <matjas> i‚Äôve used it to convince clients to enable gzip on their server before
[10:33:26] <matjas> great successssss
[10:46:09] <paul_irish> okay this probably took more time than it shoulda
[10:46:10] <paul_irish> but
[10:46:12] <paul_irish> http://paulirish.com/i/12b6e0.png
[10:46:18] <paul_irish> jquery size sans uncompressed.
[10:46:50] <paul_irish> cc matjas DaveMethvin
[10:47:25] <matjas> haha
[10:47:33] <matjas> i could make a separate page for you guys
[10:48:39] <paul_irish> or just a second chart below that one..
[10:49:13] <paul_irish> dataArr = .map(function (arr) { return arr.splice(1, 1), arr; });
[10:49:32] <paul_irish> dataArr.map(function (arr) { return arr.splice(1, 1), arr; });  // there. ez pz
[10:50:23] <matjas> paul_irish: sounds like a user script in the making
[10:50:55] <matjas> i could make the array a global if you want
[10:51:05] <DaveMethvin> thanks paul_irish ... matjas you expect me to *read* when there are pretty graphs on the page? :P
[10:51:18] <paul_irish> matjas: >:|
[10:51:41] <paul_irish> if you're editing the page you can just add in a second chart.
[10:57:07] <matjas> no u.
[12:15:02] <gnarf> hrm
[12:15:13] <gnarf> so - i can't figure out why this announcer isn't sending emails
[12:22:27] <ajpiano> that is bad news
[12:23:01] <gnarf> like it has the same config as jqueryui
[12:23:11] <gnarf> everything seems "right"
[12:24:21] <gnarf> i don't see any relevant logs
[12:25:28] <gnarf> wait
[12:25:31] <gnarf> i think i might of got it
[12:25:38] <gnarf> did that email i just sent make it to you?
[12:25:43] <gnarf> ajpiano: ?
[12:25:58] <ajpiano> yes!!!
[12:25:59] <ajpiano> it did
[12:26:10] <ajpiano> 4 e-mail sjust came through
[12:26:27] <gnarf> im not getting them
[12:26:31] <gnarf> cuz im the one posting
[12:26:59] <gnarf> at least i think so
[12:27:51] <gnarf> can someone comment on docs#1 just to see if i get a copy?
[12:27:52] <bot-t> [#1] SPAM (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/1
[12:32:49] <gnarf> hrm
[12:33:05] <gnarf> it just sent another out to you guys i think
[12:33:09] <gnarf> not sure what it was
[12:33:14] <gnarf> but maybe it seems to be working now
[12:33:22] <gnarf> now i'm not sure why i'm not getting updates
[12:35:52] <DaveMethvin> gnarf did you change anything?
[12:36:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: no, i restarted exim and cleared up some errors
[12:36:21] <gnarf> but that doesn't explain what was wrong
[12:36:25] <gnarf> i also restarted trac
[12:36:32] <DaveMethvin> they don't appear to be going to spam, i just checked
[12:36:48] <DaveMethvin> i only get emails for the tix i own tho
[12:40:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is that normal for you?
[12:40:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't have all notifying me
[12:41:05] <gnarf> alright
[12:41:11] <gnarf> i was trying to setup getting everything
[12:41:11] <DaveMethvin> but i haven't gotten any on my tix so let me check that
[12:41:45] <gnarf> i can comment on one of your tickets to test it
[12:43:08] <gnarf> seems like you got that one
[12:43:10] <DaveMethvin> gnarf yes it works now
[12:43:12] <gnarf> but i didn't
[12:43:14] <gnarf> wtf
[12:43:50] <gnarf> hah
[12:43:52] <gnarf> i think i found it
[12:58:50] <addyosmani> heya DaveMethvin
[12:59:10] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani
[12:59:20] <addyosmani> I was just playing around with $.isNumeric
[12:59:30] <addyosmani> and comparing output from isNaN
[12:59:46] <addyosmani> do we expect $.isNumeric(+10) to be true or false?
[12:59:56] <DaveMethvin> should be true
[13:00:13] <addyosmani> it is with $.isNumeric but not isNaN
[13:00:42] <DaveMethvin> do you mean ("+10") or (+10) ?
[13:00:51] <addyosmani> +10 without the quotes
[13:00:57] <DaveMethvin> the latter is just a number so it will definitely be numeric
[13:01:14] <DaveMethvin> remember that isNaN and isNumeric are kind of opposites
[13:01:19] <addyosmani> ah, of course.
[13:01:46] <DaveMethvin> one of the reasons we changed the name :)
[13:01:56] <addyosmani> I can see why :)
[13:02:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah since isNaN is already a builtin it wasn't a good idea to create a similar name with different semantics
[13:02:50] <addyosmani> absolutely makes sense
[13:03:06] <addyosmani> I was thinking of adding a few more cases to the post (undefined, direct decimals etc) - would you mind? :)
[13:03:27] <DaveMethvin> sure if  you want ... there are a bunch in the unit tests too
[13:03:33] <DaveMethvin> in core.js
[13:03:37] <addyosmani> cool cool. I'll have a look through those
[13:03:47] <DaveMethvin> so addyosmani gnarf rwaldron timmywil are we ready for rc1?
[13:03:54] <timmywil> ready!
[13:04:20] <addyosmani> ready!. If anything additional is required for the release post, always happy to help there.
[13:04:23] <gnarf> aye
[13:04:32] <DaveMethvin> my ie vms are giving me some trouble, i think it passed ie7 with the typical focus-related problems
[13:04:46] <DaveMethvin> i can't try ie8, anyone got one?
[13:04:54] <timmywil> i can
[13:04:55] <addyosmani> can it be browserstack'd?
[13:05:04] <timmywil> that too
[13:05:07] <timmywil> well
[13:05:15] <addyosmani> We're working with the team there to get testswarm integration and a bunch of other stuff, but still manual testing for now
[13:05:17] <timmywil> needs to reference local, but i think that can be set up
[13:05:29] <addyosmani> yep. local tunneling is supported I believe
[13:05:41] <timmywil> i've got it open anyway
[13:06:07] <gnarf> we can point a few browsers at swarm and try to green out that last job
[13:06:31] <DaveMethvin> sounds good ... i am running ie9 right now and can do ie6
[13:07:25] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/142/
[13:07:57] <Krinkle-away> running swarm in Safari now
[13:08:02] <timmywil> <3 browserstack.  i just set it up and am running it there too
[13:09:10] <timmywil> local vm pass
[13:09:49] <DaveMethvin> ie9 pass
[13:09:51] <timmywil> wo, i made the browserstack machine restart somehow
[13:14:43] <gnarf> so hey
[13:14:48] <gnarf> this :focus doesn't match test
[13:16:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf
[13:16:05] <Krinkle> running swarm in Opera 11.10 as well for completion
[13:16:09] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/142/
[13:16:11] <gnarf> it's failing because IE can't "clear" focus using .blur
[13:16:12] <Krinkle> getting greener :)
[13:16:33] <gnarf> so you have to input.ownerDocument.body.focus() or something
[13:16:55] <gnarf> or however you do that
[13:16:57] <DaveMethvin> i thought I had tried a couple of other things like focusing another element
[13:17:07] <BradleyS> speaking of testswarm, anyone notice ios5 safari being rejected? i pinged joern on twitter but didn't hear back. he's usually pretty good about it, i assume he's busy
[13:17:26] <BradleyS> mobilewebkit v. 534.46 fyi
[13:17:34] <gnarf> IE doesn't let you .blur() an input - this i know for sure
[13:17:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez and I ran into that trying to fix up units in UI
[13:17:48] <Krinkle> BradleyS: Latest iOS version is 4.2
[13:18:00] <Krinkle> BradleyS: Just needs an additional entry in user agents.sql for 5.0
[13:18:16] <BradleyS> yeah, i know it ;)
[13:18:23] <Krinkle> just saying..
[13:19:07] <DaveMethvin> speaking of ios5 ... can anyone confirm docs#10546?
[13:19:09] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, #10546 (.live not working on iOS 5) ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10546
[13:20:09] <BradleyS> anyway, until someone adds that ua, (at least my) iphone 4s need not apply
[13:20:17] <BradleyS> no worries, just a heads up
[13:21:27] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf, i would LOVE to get a clean finish on the testswarm, but it seems like we'd need to skip/remove those tests to do it
[13:21:36] <DaveMethvin> i would prefer to leave them in for manual testing
[13:21:47] <BradleyS> Krinkle: i should clarify, i'm assuming that's local config, is it not? sounds like a pull request would be in order if not
[13:21:49] <DaveMethvin> is there some flag we can use/introduce
[13:21:57] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: confirmed
[13:22:01] <addyosmani> just tested on iOS 5
[13:22:18] <DaveMethvin> well damn. addyosmani can you note on the ticket?
[13:22:20] <Krinkle> BradleyS: pull request to the repo is always good in general for people installing new swarms and whenever we reinstall ours.
[13:22:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: kind of - but i would suggest against hiding the failure, considering that a second browser which IS in focus will make it pass green
[13:22:25] <addyosmani> yep. doing now DaveMethvin
[13:22:48] <Krinkle> BradleyS: as for swarm.jquery.org, a git pull doesn't do it. It needs to be executed on the mysql database manually (an insert command for that row, and an update command for the changes)
[13:23:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: and hopefully at some point soonish, browserstack will be donating us the ability to have one of each of these envrionments permanently pointed at swarm
[13:23:22] <BradleyS> ok, that's how i thought it was going down in the past. just didn't want to be wasting anybody's time if it were a patch/pull away
[13:23:56] <DaveMethvin> oh waitaminit addyosmani ... well go ahead and confirm but if that's on an iPhone the problem is that divs don't generate clicks, right?
[13:24:23] <DaveMethvin> if that was a link, then it would generate a click
[13:24:27] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: It sounded like there was a fix for the focus test though, can it still be fixed (instead of hiding the failure)
[13:24:41] <Krinkle> something with ownerDocument.body.focus
[13:24:49] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin: well, it worked fine for the .bind() test on click (touch) so I assume it should have for .live() as well, no?
[13:24:58] <gnarf> Krinkle: for the ie7 failure, yes
[13:25:01] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani: not sure
[13:25:15] <gnarf> there are two tests with :focus
[13:25:18] <gnarf> one tests that it does match
[13:25:23] <DaveMethvin> if someone will send me an iphone5 i can test :P
[13:25:29] <gnarf> which can fail if the browser window is out of foucs and matchesSelector is being used
[13:25:51] <gnarf> one that tests that the input after bluring doesn't match :focus
[13:26:15] <gnarf> this one can fail when the browser doesn't allow bluring an input (like we've encountered with ie)
[13:26:36] <DaveMethvin> The test page has lots of inputs so we can focus to something else
[13:27:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, that should fix the one case - but its only a bug in the unit
[13:27:32] <gnarf> im more concerned with the opera ajax fail, and what seems to be a bad ie8
[13:28:04] <gnarf> and / or ie 9
[13:28:10] <gnarf> still no results for old FF either
[13:29:20] <gnarf> im pointing my ie8 at swarm now
[13:29:46] <DaveMethvin> ie9 ran clean for me here
[13:29:56] <DaveMethvin> i see the opera ajax prob, it rings a bell
[13:30:16] * gnarf gets hungry
[13:31:08] <DaveMethvin> haven't had lunch yet garf?
[13:31:39] <DaveMethvin> there's a browser sniff in that ajax unit test for safari, which ignores the text sent and always sends OK on a 200
[13:34:04] <gnarf> also, those focus tests might want to get delayed a frame
[13:35:22] <DaveMethvin> i think that same thing may be going on with opera now, it's substituting a standard message for the custom one perhaps? doesn't look like a showstopper in any case
[13:35:44] <DaveMethvin> that is, the ajax test fail
[13:36:27] <gnarf> yeah
[13:36:31] <gnarf> anyone hit old FF?
[13:38:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i looked into it.  it's not the same issue as safari
[13:39:03] <timmywil> but idk what it is
[14:06:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: in that issue slex noticed, it seems quickIs is matching more broadly than it should
[14:06:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah i opened a ticket
[14:06:37] <DaveMethvin> docs#10567
[14:06:38] <bot-t> [#10567] Delegated events incorrectly match class names (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10567
[14:07:04] <timmywil> heh, you and i thought the same thing apparently
[14:08:11] <DaveMethvin> good thing alex makes crazy test cases
[14:08:12] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: also, I'm a little concerned about the attr matching
[14:08:27] <DaveMethvin> how so?
[14:08:39] <timmywil> .getAttribute returns properties in IE6/7
[14:08:59] <DaveMethvin> well rememember that we're in a subset situation here, it may not matter
[14:09:08] <DaveMethvin> i thought about a few of them but maybe didn't think it all through
[14:09:21] <DaveMethvin> that is, we don't have to worry about xml for example since this is dom events
[14:09:24] <timmywil> yea, i don't exactly know the code path
[14:10:04] <timmywil> xml is not an issue
[14:11:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: lemme see if i can make it fail :)
[14:11:14] <DaveMethvin> OH NO!
[14:15:28] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well, here's something off the top of my head http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/u3NyG/3/
[14:16:01] <DaveMethvin> nodeName is a property, cheater
[14:16:23] <timmywil> point is, anything that will match as a property that is not present as an attribute will match in ie
[14:16:30] <timmywil> but not in modern browsers
[14:16:40] <timmywil> that is a problem
[14:17:16] <timmywil> lemme figure out a real world example
[14:17:25] <DaveMethvin> well at this point i'm inclined to throw that part overboard, since it's like 4% of all usage
[14:17:36] <DaveMethvin> the main stuff was class and id
[14:17:38] <DaveMethvin> and tag
[14:18:46] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/u3NyG/6/
[14:19:08] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I notice there's some annoying bugs with the tooltips on qunitjs.com when I hover the top left icons and play with it, 9/10 cases they do not hide properly (some error in how it detects mouse out)
[14:19:30] <timmywil> i mean, im not coming up with good ones right now, but it's really wide open
[14:19:39] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: for the id one, i see your point but i didn't see any real-world usage of that
[14:19:47] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure anyone would even think of doing that
[14:19:59] <timmywil> ugh, hold on
[14:20:00] <DaveMethvin> so i am inclined to let someone report it as a bug
[14:20:03] <timmywil> heh
[14:20:53] <DaveMethvin> the attributes one i see your point, and removing it simplifies the code slightly without reducing the performance benefit
[14:21:00] <gnarf> um
[14:21:03] <gnarf> where is this RE?
[14:21:14] <DaveMethvin> its in event.js
[14:21:49] <DaveMethvin> i've got it fixed locally with a test case but am waiting for timmywil to find more bugs :P
[14:23:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: oo, here's one http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/u3NyG/7/
[14:24:03] <timmywil> matches in IE, but not chrome
[14:24:14] <timmywil> i can keep going
[14:24:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can just pull attributes
[14:24:32] <DaveMethvin> so now it would be tag#id.class
[14:25:07] <DaveMethvin> too bad but like i said it wasn't a big percentage of usage
[14:26:29] <timmywil> i think that's best
[14:29:23] <gnarf> how would it handle tag#id\\.boom?
[14:30:31] <paul_irish> http://blog.jquery.com/?p=1566&preview=true&preview_id=1566&public=1&nonce=945885fdfc
[14:30:38] <paul_irish> jquery standards team announcement
[14:30:39] <paul_irish> cc addyosmani
[14:31:20] <timmywil> paul_irish: hawt
[14:31:34] <addyosmani> did my post need any changes paul_irish? reading through
[14:31:59] <paul_irish> addyosmani: group -> team. added screenshot and images. added links. added link to my blog post.
[14:32:04] <addyosmani> cool cool
[14:32:09] <paul_irish> thats about it
[14:32:32] <paul_irish> addyosmani: also.. almost 50% -> over 50%
[14:32:57] <addyosmani> lol. I can't remember if the stats only recently tilted over, but you're right, its over 50% atm
[14:33:06] <paul_irish> builtwith had a tweet a few days ago
[14:33:25] <paul_irish> also i should set you to the author
[14:33:46] <paul_irish> how..... :S
[14:33:55] <addyosmani> lol. I don't know if you can. let me check
[14:34:05] <paul_irish> got it.
[14:34:31] <addyosmani> so you have. thanks paul_irish!
[14:34:37] <paul_irish> npnp
[14:36:31] <paul_irish> shipped it http://blog.jquery.com/2011/10/24/announcing-the-jquery-standards-team/
[14:36:50] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: re: how would it handle tag#id\\.boom?
[14:36:59] <DaveMethvin> it passes anything it can't parse thru to sizzle
[14:37:08] <gnarf> but it can parse that right?
[14:37:23] <gnarf> it assumes id is "id\" and class "boom"
[14:37:29] <gnarf> or not
[14:37:30] <gnarf> nope
[14:37:32] <gnarf> no \\
[14:37:36] <gnarf> nevermind
[14:37:42] <DaveMethvin> no it punts on a non \w\- id
[14:37:44] <gnarf> seems restrictive enough
[14:37:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah i punish bizarre id names!
[14:38:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: cool, that works
[14:38:36] <DaveMethvin> the main thing was to handle the common case since I know sizzle can do the hard stuff
[14:39:36] <timmywil> i think tad#id.class covers most of them
[14:39:38] <gnarf> hrm
[14:39:40] <gnarf> you know
[14:39:45] <DaveMethvin> just gotta finish updating the test case for the loss of [attr=value]
[14:39:47] <gnarf> you might wanna put that $ at the end
[14:39:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: whats the RE at right now?
[14:40:18] <DaveMethvin> 	rquickIs = /^([\w\-]+)?(?:#([\w\-]+))?(?:\.([\w\-]+))?$/,
[14:40:50] <gnarf> right...
[14:40:56] <gnarf> can a tag name ever have a - ?
[14:41:59] <gnarf> but yeah, that RE was wat i was gonna suggest - but you already had it ;)
[14:42:50] <DaveMethvin> on the tag name, good q
[14:43:10] <DaveMethvin> i prolly just copy-pastad it i don't think any html tags have dashes so i shoudl remove it
[14:43:39] <gnarf> in which case /^(\w*)(?:#....
[14:45:59] <Rwhitbeck> Nice blog post addyosmani and paul_irish
[14:46:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i think it's valid in xml
[14:46:37] <addyosmani> thx Rwhitbeck. It's wycats and paul_irish that really deserve praise for starting that sub-team.
[14:46:43] <timmywil> so no
[14:47:13] <timmywil> but no, there are no defined html elements with -
[14:47:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah tag names can have dashes but if they're in xml land i am likely to want to punt to sizzle :)
[14:47:41] <timmywil> like you said, this is just dom events
[14:51:32] <DaveMethvin> damn it takes longer to fix the test case than the code
[15:07:51] <DaveMethvin> ok, running full tests again to be sure

[15:08:29] <rpflo> DaveMethvin: explaining your actions always takes longer than doing them :)
[15:08:56] <DaveMethvin> oh i can always explain them, but rarely justify them

[15:11:00] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Fix #10567. Make sure quickIs matches correct class name.
[15:11:00] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Remove attribute match from quickIs
[15:14:51] <DaveMethvin> ok, as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted ... are we ready rc1 then? :)
[15:16:01] <gnarf> i think so
[15:16:50] <DaveMethvin> well it's only a release candidate so what the heck
[15:17:19] <gnarf> we should do what we can for that focus test too in selector
[15:17:29] <gnarf> try to minimize the false negatives
[15:18:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if you look in swarminject.js (might be somewhere else in jQuery core, i don't remember, but ui has swarminject.js) you can see how to test the swarm envrionment - i believe it actually sets a QUnit flag
[15:19:04] <gnarf> although i think the failure for not having the browser in focus is acceptable
[15:19:19] <gnarf> and it should be "caught" by a valid swarm client

[15:29:19] <ajpiano> ya
[15:29:24] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[15:29:39] <mikesherov_> hello

[15:31:52] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: tag the release?
[15:32:00] <timmywil> brb
[15:32:06] <DaveMethvin> o sorry i forgot to push
[15:32:29] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/JfMKIg

[15:32:39] <DaveMethvin> ahhhh, that's better
[15:32:46] <DaveMethvin> what good is a checklist if you dont check it?
[15:33:52] <mikesherov_> ok
[15:34:13] <mikesherov_> apparently i never registered my name to begin with... next time perhaps

[15:36:27] <mikesherov_> what's the deal with testSwarm?
[15:36:39] <mikesherov_> what is it, and why is it saying there are failures?
[15:36:42] <timmywil_> DaveMethvin: Thanks :) its already on the cdn?
[15:36:52] <DaveMethvin> yep
[15:37:02] <DaveMethvin> the build script does it for us
[15:37:22] <timmywil_> mikesherov_: We're having issues with the swarm test enviro
[15:37:27] <mikesherov_> k
[15:37:34] <timmywil_> DaveMethvin: Right, forgot about that
[15:40:09] <mikesherov_> 1.7rc1 is happening right now?
[15:44:27] <mikesherov_> rwaldron: I updated my PR for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/562
[15:44:28] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 6h ago): fixes #9233, make sure runtimeStyle isn't affected by dimensions
[15:44:43] <mikesherov_> wasn't 100% sure what you meant by making sure the test works in all browsers
[15:44:53] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_:  it's happened, but we can still do bug fixes if they're low risk
[15:45:10] <mikesherov_> so would appreciate some feedback when/if you have time
[15:45:18] <DaveMethvin> after 1.6.3 i've raised my assessment of low risk :)
[15:45:32] <mikesherov_> what happened in 1.6.3?
[15:45:40] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ as in, don't write weird tests that appear to run zero assertions in chrome
[15:46:07] <mikesherov_> ok, so I made the browsers that don't have runtimeStyle just do:
[15:46:19] <timmywil> functionunction
[15:46:19] <rwaldron> figure out a way to write a test that asserts that same, correct, unbroken behaviour occurs in all browsers
[15:46:21] <mikesherov_> ok( true, "this browser doesnt have runtimestyle");
[15:46:27] <rwaldron> no
[15:46:30] <mikesherov_> hmmm
[15:46:31] <rwaldron> thats not what I meant
[15:46:35] <mikesherov_> LOL
[15:46:52] <mikesherov_> so, the behavior only effects 1 browser
[15:47:07] <rwaldron> but jQuery is a _unified_api_
[15:47:37] <rwaldron> I'm not asking you to kick a puppy
[15:47:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the blog post is linking to 1.7b2 btw
[15:47:42] <rwaldron> just write a damn test
[15:47:44] <rwaldron> :P
[15:47:45] <timmywil> aight, gotta run
[15:47:52] <mikesherov_> Yup, I get that, but the API effects a portion of of IE that jQuery doesn't read
[15:48:05] <mikesherov_> I'm not arguing, I'm just confused on what to do
[15:49:03] <mikesherov_> so, jQuery currently writes a runtimeStyle, but doesn't even deal with runtimeStyle on the read side of things
[15:49:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil fixed thanks
[15:49:53] <rwaldron> the OPs test case was contrived at best
[15:50:12] <mikesherov_> Sure, very contrived
[15:50:15] <mikesherov_> and the fix is simple
[15:50:22] <mikesherov_> that's what I said in the notes
[15:50:35] <rwaldron> i read it all
[15:51:06] <rwaldron> maybe it's not that important
[15:51:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin do you care if a test only gets run in IE?
[15:51:48] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron mikesherov_ not if it only works in IE
[15:51:59] <rwaldron> i just went from caring to burnt out
[15:52:01] <mikesherov_> Yeah, not arguing... I'm just trying to get a handle on what can be done to fix this.
[15:52:05] <mikesherov_> LOL
[15:52:16] <mikesherov_> I ask mostly for myself
[15:52:17] <DaveMethvin> sometimes ie just wears you down
[15:52:35] <DaveMethvin> there are a few tests where i've had to do that
[15:52:38] <mikesherov_> I'm trying to get better at my PR's so my contributions don't cause you undue grief
[15:53:01] <mikesherov_> I just love smashing bugs, whether or not they are high priority
[15:53:02] <DaveMethvin> we had an opera 10.6 bug where i just had to say ok( true, "opera can't do that" )
[15:53:16] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ its not you
[15:53:26] <DaveMethvin> blame it on the dog rwaldron
[15:53:27] <rwaldron> I'm just burnt out on dealing with IE
[15:53:35] <rwaldron> IE makes me hate the internet
[15:53:36] <mikesherov_> yeah, I here you
[15:53:38] <rwaldron> seriously
[15:53:55] <mikesherov_> I've dropped IE6 support on all my companies projects
[15:53:55] <rwaldron> makes me want to shovel shit instead of developing for the web
[15:54:18] <mikesherov_> And I'm dropping 7 once it's under 5% of visits
[15:54:38] <mikesherov_> I'm giving them "use chrome frame or GTFO"
[15:54:50] <DaveMethvin> so for the test i guess it depends on whether you think it is an ie-specific thing that we need to test
[15:54:54] <rwaldron> <3 love it
[15:55:04] <DaveMethvin> and also whether you think it is likely to break in the future
[15:55:36] <mikesherov_> well, I mean, jQuery's only real interaction with runtimeStyle is when it writes to it
[15:55:43] <DaveMethvin> those unit tests are gold jerry, GOLD when we're refactoring
[15:55:53] <mikesherov_> it doesn't read froim it
[15:56:16] <DaveMethvin> so if you want to put in an ie-specific test to prevent a regression i think that's fine if theres no reasonable way to make it cross-browser
[15:56:29] <mikesherov_> so my test said: "if you support runtimeStyle, check that jQuery didn't fuck it up", otherwise "ok, we don't have runtimeStyle"
[15:56:35] <mikesherov_> I don't do an IE-specific test
[15:56:45] <mikesherov_> I do a runtimeStyle support specific test
[15:56:46] <rwaldron> it's used as a secret means to calculate px, right?
[15:56:51] <mikesherov_> yes
[15:56:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that's basically what you're doing and i think thats fine
[15:56:55] <mikesherov_> only ever written to
[15:57:08] <rwaldron> but testing the runtimeStyle property is the bogus part
[15:57:13] <rwaldron> because who cares?
[15:57:13] <mikesherov_> if it had effects inside jQuery, well... that's a different story, I'd write that in a second
[15:57:27] <rwaldron> we're _never_ using it elsewhere, right?
[15:57:30] <mikesherov_> Well, I care
[15:57:31] <DaveMethvin> i mean, if the test can run and work fine for everyone else then i'd just run through the case for everyone
[15:57:56] <mikesherov_> I care that the fix is dead simple, is a regression for someone, and I have a valid test for that scenario
[15:58:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin but it cant
[15:58:18] <rwaldron> because only IE has runtimeStyle prop
[15:58:24] <rwaldron> Opera used to have it
[15:58:25] <mikesherov_> right, jQuery has 0 code paths that read from runtimeStyle
[15:58:28] <rwaldron> when it was playing "dress up"
[15:58:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah so an ie-specific test (ya feature checked etc) makes sense
[15:58:42] <mikesherov_> so it's not like the side effect is present INSIDE jQuery
[15:58:59] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: playing dress up makes me think of miketalyr in drag
[15:59:10] <mikesherov_> well, I don't want to anger guys like cinsoft ;-)
[15:59:11] <rwaldron> ahahahahahaahahhahahahaha
[15:59:19] <DaveMethvin> ugh mental picture, must eliminate
[15:59:20] <rwaldron> he sucks
[15:59:28] <mikesherov_> worse than life
[15:59:31] <rwaldron> (not miketaylr)
[15:59:44] <mikesherov_> aggressive, idealistic for no reason
[15:59:46] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin you cant "unlearn" that
[15:59:47] <rwaldron> hahaha
[15:59:57] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ mostly he's just wrong
[16:00:08] <mikesherov_> he thinks we should feature test everything in case a future browser magically supports some crazy thing
[16:00:15] <mikesherov_> it's absurd
[16:00:27] <mikesherov_> but that's a different story
[16:00:32] <rwaldron> his tweets encourage the _worst_ programming
[16:00:41] <mikesherov_> paranoid bullshit
[16:00:44] <rwaldron> I was shocked to learn that he has a CS degree
[16:00:51] <mikesherov_> I'm not
[16:01:04] <mikesherov_> I learned the dumbest shit in school
[16:01:12] <mikesherov_> everyone learns how to write bank software
[16:01:15] <rwaldron> he blatantly disregards programming patterns
[16:01:20] <mikesherov_> but no one is ever writing that
[16:01:44] <mikesherov_> I got my degree 7 years ago, and it's been worthless ever since
[16:01:50] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ he thinks you should feature test, but write a function wrapper for it
[16:02:04] <rwaldron> function maybeIEHasSomeNewDOMAPI()
[16:02:16] <mikesherov_> right, future proof
[16:02:22] <mikesherov_> so bullshit
[16:02:25] <mikesherov_> the opposite of YAGNI
[16:02:47] <rwaldron> btw
[16:02:54] <rwaldron> reheating pizza in the oven FTW
[16:03:04] <mikesherov_> LOL
[16:03:04] <rwaldron> microwaves are for the 80s
[16:03:13] <mikesherov_> convection oven
[16:03:22] <rwaldron> blow dryer
[16:03:38] <mikesherov_> <random heating element>
[16:03:46] <mikesherov_> radiator
[16:04:36] <rwaldron> sometimes, when i try to go to google, i see this http://gyazo.com/0a318bda446e8f2fc9be3232adc05181.png
[16:04:41] <rwaldron> weird
[16:05:55] <mikesherov_> but, back to the PR, I mostly just want the bug fixed. I can't think of a better test than I have already, and it likely effects very few users, but it's the right fix.
[16:06:28] <mikesherov_> yeah, google is kind of iffy today
[16:07:54] <rwaldron> thats like... feedburner?
[16:08:13] <mikesherov_> google apps sucked today too
[16:08:23] <rwaldron> i wonder what the use case is to check an elem's runtimeStyle?
[16:08:57] <mikesherov_> I dunno, it's when you want to be damn sure that's the style that is applied
[16:09:08] <mikesherov_> it's like a super trump card
[16:09:16] <mikesherov_> who the hell really knows
[16:09:36] <mikesherov_> I gotta run, thanks for the chat
[16:10:30] <rwaldron> later
[17:34:07] <jzaefferer> ?tell krinkle the whole theme and site is very much a draft - if you spot issues in the theme, this is the right place to report them: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues
[17:34:07] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
