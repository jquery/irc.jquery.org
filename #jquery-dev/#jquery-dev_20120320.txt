[04:57:27] <bot-t1> (5 hours 33 mins ago) <Krinkle> tell scott_gonzalez I figured as much, since it was still running MediaWiki 1.8 (2006!). But while it exists, I'd be happy to do a little cleaning up and keeping it up to date (assuming content is going to migrated from it in some way shape or form)
[04:57:28] <bot-t1> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[09:18:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Lemme know when you're back, wanna discuss https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commit/f2da2db0ad8b90afcdda93696bbfe5496ab8a296 for a second

[09:18:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on testswarm by jzaefferer (6m, 2w ago): Fix job submission to accept GET and POST parameters for the state-argument. Make sure that the returned location is relative to the current resource, so that a client can append that to the URL of the instance
[09:19:22] <Krinkle> danheberden: :) (regarding wiki access)
[09:21:43] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I'm here
[09:22:05] <Krinkle> I'm trying to figure out what happened to addjob
[09:22:08] <Krinkle> the HTML form version of it
[09:22:24] <Krinkle> the html form is in content/addjob.php
[09:22:36] <Krinkle> if there is a POST then the logic handles it and redirects early
[09:22:51] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure, though that reminds me that I never actually used the form, always did submission from curl or via Jenkins
[09:23:01] <Krinkle> otherwise it returned early so that ./content (included after ./logic) continous
[09:23:06] <jzaefferer> so if I broke something, that might help to explain...
[09:23:10] <Krinkle> Why did you change $_POST to $_REQUEST ?
[09:23:40] <jzaefferer> Might be due to Jenkins sending GET instead of POST requests
[09:23:47] <Krinkle> I understand it from the commit-msg but when it's a post request (e.g. from curl) then state=addjob can (or is) simply part of the query string
[09:24:07] <Krinkle> Aha
[09:24:10] <Krinkle> Hm..
[09:24:18] <Krinkle> Well, I'm fine with removing the html form
[09:24:32] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Progress on the APi is going well so far
[09:25:16] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Once the API allows submissions, we could restore the form to only look for POST
[09:25:22] <Krinkle> Right
[09:25:39] <Krinkle> The plan so far is create a lightweight "RESTFULL" API, like 1/json/job/123 or 1/jsonp/user/jquery
[09:25:42] <jzaefferer> The timing is about the same as my jenkins-testswarm updates at the time..
[09:26:06] <Krinkle> OK, I'll leave it as is for now to avoid breakage
[09:26:24] <jzaefferer> Oh how much I despise Java folder structures by now...
[09:26:24] <Krinkle> version/format/action (option: /argument)
[09:26:32] <jzaefferer> src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm
[09:26:35] <jzaefferer> fuuuuuu
[09:26:37] <Krinkle> yeah
[09:27:16] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: fun http://projects.haykranen.nl/java/
[09:27:32] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah
[09:27:34] <jzaefferer> urlConnection.setRequestMethod("HEAD");
[09:27:40] <jzaefferer> not even doing a GET
[09:27:45] <Krinkle> interesting
[09:27:50] <jzaefferer> I'm pretty sure at the time I tried to change that to a POST and failed :/
[09:28:40] <Krinkle> So for the API I'm planning to detect availability of PATHINFO so that the API can be called like api.php/1/json/getneeded
[09:29:48] <jzaefferer> first part is the version?
[09:29:53] <Krinkle> yeah
[09:30:07] <jzaefferer> will that require more Rewrite rules?
[09:30:16] <Krinkle> Not required
[09:30:34] <Krinkle> It only requires rewrite rules if you want to get rid of 'api.php'
[09:31:21] <Krinkle> like how /login becomes index.php?state=login, that requires a rewrite rule. But path info arguments to a php script are supported without rewrite rules
[09:32:57] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: do you know if anything other than testswarm itself uses state=getjob or state=sendjob?
[09:33:07] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Do you have a comprehensive resource on rights management in mediawiki?
[09:33:38] <jzaefferer> Regarding getjob/sendjob: I don't think so
[09:33:42] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: well, there is me. I know it pretty well as I work on in every day inside out (mediawiki)
[09:34:01] <Krinkle> but there is documentation for sure
[09:34:35] <jzaefferer> Yeah, don't want to bother you with general questions before I dug a bit into the docs - though a place to start would be much appreciated
[09:34:44] <Krinkle> however if you mean specifically for docs.jquery.com, then no because that runs an ancient version of mediawiki, I am not sure how things were back then. The rights system likely has been rewritten since then
[09:35:37] <Krinkle> nope, has last been rewritten in mediawiki 1.5, jquery runs 1.8
[09:36:17] <Krinkle> So basically MediaWiki works like this: Every user is in 1 or more groups. And in the LocalSettings.php you decide which group has which rights via $wgGroupPermissions
[09:36:18] <Krinkle> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgGroupPermissions
[09:36:40] <Krinkle> and on the wiki itself via Special:UserRights you can add/remove a user from a group
[09:37:08] <Krinkle> (only bureaucrat users can do that btw)
[09:37:39] <Krinkle> because $wgGroupPermissions['bureaucrat']['userrights'] = true; by default
[09:37:44] <jzaefferer> Okay, so no web interface editing group permissions
[09:38:09] <Krinkle> well, the default groups should be more than enough for most wikis
[09:38:32] <Krinkle> so you don't need to edit the group permissions, but add or remove a user to it, that you can do from the web interface
[09:38:52] <Krinkle> anything in particular?
[09:39:33] <jzaefferer> Restricting access to certain pages to just certain users is what I'm actually looking for
[09:39:41] <jzaefferer> Not for docs.jquery.com (that's going away!)
[09:39:46] <Krinkle> OK
[09:39:55] <Krinkle> Well MediaWiki has page protection
[09:40:31] <Krinkle> A user in the wikiadmin user group (or some other group that has the 'protect' user right), can protect an individual page against editing
[09:40:31] <jzaefferer> That's just for editing? Or also for viewing?
[09:40:38] <Krinkle> then only other wikiadmins can edit it
[09:40:53] <jzaefferer> Any way to restrict viewing?
[09:40:55] <Krinkle> MediaWiki does not support restricting view access in any way
[09:41:17] <Krinkle> there are plugins that claim to do it, but if its sensitive, don't sue us if you lose your job :P
[09:41:37] <jzaefferer> Haha
[09:41:53] <Krinkle> MEdiaWiki does support restrict viewing of an entire wiki however, with a whitelist of certain pages
[09:42:10] <Krinkle> For example https://office.wikimedia.org/
[09:42:21] <Krinkle> that's a restricted wiki, and that's pure core functionality
[09:42:28] <Krinkle> the home page and login is whitelisted
[09:42:51] <Krinkle> but the other way around is not supported by default
[09:43:01] <Krinkle> It's not very wiki either :)
[09:43:36] <jzaefferer> All the plugins I can find are just patching mediawiki
[09:43:40] <jzaefferer> That's not really an extension :/
[09:44:04] <Krinkle> In general if you want to restrict viewing of a certain set of pages, don't put it on the wiki. Or set up a separate wiki for it
[09:44:20] <Krinkle> e.g. internal-wiki.example.org and wiki.example.org
[09:44:58] <Krinkle> the main problem with restricting some pages is due to the many ways to view a page
[09:45:09] <Krinkle> diff views, history views, API, watchlist, recent changes.
[09:45:20] <jzaefferer> Right..
[09:45:33] <Krinkle> not to mention embedding and transcluding of pages in pages in pages in pages in pages etc.
[09:45:50] <Krinkle> you know how nasty that is from the jquery docs wiki
[09:45:56] <Krinkle> templates in templates in templates ..
[09:46:10] <jzaefferer> I don't even want to think about those
[09:46:46] <Krinkle> btw, back to testswarm
[09:46:57] <Krinkle> if I visit just a plain ?state=addjob
[09:46:57] <jzaefferer> Yeah
[09:47:08] <Krinkle> without anything else
[09:47:13] <Krinkle> I'm redirected to a new job page
[09:47:25] <Krinkle> weird
[09:47:35] <jzaefferer> ukay
[09:47:37] <Krinkle> it creates a job out of nothing
[09:47:38] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=addjob
[09:47:45] <Krinkle> job 53
[09:47:46] <Krinkle> 54
[09:47:47] <Krinkle> oops
[09:48:26] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/137/5c4.jpg
[09:48:37] <Krinkle> O_O
[09:48:52] <Krinkle> LOL
[09:49:45] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Btw. we'll give this a try, at least it doesn't require patching: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PrivatePageProtection
[09:50:01] <Krinkle> Can you elaborate on what you're doing though?
[09:50:24] <jzaefferer> Regarding mediawiki? Really not that important :-)
[09:50:47] <Krinkle> well, you want to restrict read access. I wonder what you're hiding :P
[11:28:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: wow, I really have to get used to git. I'm so used to svn as of lately due to MediaWiki (btw: Wikimedia is moving to git tomorrow). Now with testswarm
[11:28:51] <Krinkle> ...
[11:29:02] <Krinkle> it's happened to me at least 3 times now that I committed without adding first
[11:29:11] <Krinkle> in svn you only have to 'svn add' for newly created files
[11:29:28] <Krinkle> I like that I can change 2 files and 'add' only 1, but still needs getting use dot
[11:29:29] <Krinkle> to*
[11:32:34] <jzaefferer> yeah, takes some getting used to
[11:32:52] <jzaefferer> though don't to `git add .` all the time, that's a really bad habit
[11:33:05] <jzaefferer> `git commit -a` is fine, as that doesn't add new files
[11:33:20] <jzaefferer> I'm mostly doing `git cm "commit message"`
[11:33:38] <jzaefferer> [alias]\ncm = commit -am
[11:37:57] <Krinkle> I don't do "git add ."
[11:38:11] <Krinkle> so git commit -a, adds changed files?
[11:38:19] <jzaefferer> I usually use that when intialzing a new repo
[11:38:26] <jzaefferer> yeah

[17:06:21] <mikesherov> HAHAHAHA
[17:06:26] <mikesherov> nice gnarf
[17:08:09] <ajpiano> mikesherov: my e-mails started again
[17:08:11] <ajpiano> i don't know what you did
[17:08:12] <ajpiano> but i like it
[17:08:23] <mikesherov> I didn't do shit actually, all danheberden
[17:08:46] <ajpiano> oh helly a
[17:09:37] <mikesherov> I'm still figuring out how to beat up MySQL
[17:09:45] <mikesherov> it needs slow query log turned on
[17:09:58] <mikesherov> there are some serious unoptimized queries there
[17:18:38] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[17:19:01] <mikesherov> Hey DaveMethvin, I had a few questions
[17:19:09] <DaveMethvin> fire away
[17:19:11] <mikesherov> bugs.jquery.com is the only place that uses trac right?
[17:19:22] <DaveMethvin> the only place for core
[17:19:28] <DaveMethvin> there's a different install at jqueryui
[17:19:52] <mikesherov> I mean, if I just disable #!html processing in the parser, will that effect tutorials or other pages on bugs.jquery.com?
[17:20:07] <DaveMethvin> that would be a danheberden question
[17:20:12] <mikesherov> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[17:20:17] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure, maybe docs.jquery.com is there too
[17:20:19] <mikesherov> like that doesn't use trac right?
[17:20:30] <DaveMethvin> that uses a wiki i think
[17:20:31] <mikesherov> hmmm
[17:20:34] <mikesherov> trac wiki?
[17:20:37] <mikesherov> grrr
[17:20:52] <DaveMethvin> all the docs.jquery.com stuff is being migrated and discarded
[17:21:00] <danheberden> yo - trac is only at bugs.jquery.com and bugs.jqueryui.com
[17:21:05] <mikesherov> k
[17:21:07] <mikesherov> awesome
[17:21:13] <danheberden> same python lib, but diff installs at /var/www
[17:21:22] <mikesherov> danheberden, if I know what to change in trac, how do I reboot it?
[17:21:23] <danheberden> or wherever the hell it is
[17:21:33] <DaveMethvin> so looks like the spammer has now taken williamk
[17:21:48] <DaveMethvin> but at least we could tell since emails are back :P
[17:21:48] <danheberden>  /etc/init.d/spawn-fcgi-process or something
[17:21:55] <danheberden> restart/stop/start etc
[17:22:11] <mikesherov> Do I need a restart after I modify a .py file?
[17:22:19] <mikesherov> I never screwed around with trac in fcgi
[17:22:21] <danheberden> i don't think so
[17:22:30] <danheberden> but unsure
[17:22:54] <danheberden> it's like any relationship i've had - anytime i think i got something figured out...;
[17:23:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah i woke up with a trac install after a night of heavy drinking and had to chew my arm off once
[17:23:47] <mikesherov> hs
[17:23:53] <danheberden> these cold showers fully clothed scrubbing myself violently with a bar of soap are getting pretty normal now
[17:24:07] <DaveMethvin> so true
[17:24:09] <mikesherov> trac/wiki/formatter.py is the file needing change
[17:24:38] <danheberden> you can't change it mikesherov - it has to want to change on its own
[17:24:58] <danheberden> oh, wait </relationshipanalogy>
[17:25:31] <mikesherov> def _html_processor(self, text):
[17:25:50] <mikesherov> just put return '' on the next line
[17:26:01] <mikesherov> but can't figure out how to get the change to stick
[17:26:27] <danheberden> maybe try rebooting the service then? /etc/init.d/spawn-trac-yadayada restart
[17:26:36] <mikesherov> k, trying
[17:27:06] <danheberden> well, `sudo /etc....`
[17:28:13] <mikesherov> here goes nothing:
[17:28:22] <mikesherov> \/etc/init.d/spawn-fcgi-trac restart
[17:28:42] <danheberden> IJOIJRO@IRH(*# JWO(JF(* UW(*OJO$#HINKJWPOI UR_()@IK<MJ<>HOW(F
[17:28:55] <mikesherov> nope, nothing
[17:29:23] <mikesherov> what's this: trac-bugs.jquery.com
[17:29:32] <mikesherov> in etc/init.d
[17:29:50] <danheberden> it's one someone made but it doesn't work :/
[17:30:05] <mikesherov> hmmm, so
[17:30:06] <danheberden> i had thought gnarf made it and that it just needed a tweak
[17:30:18] <mikesherov> I know exactly where the change is, I don't know how to get it to stick
[17:31:02] <danheberden> maybe the running fcgi processes are sticking?
[17:31:05] <danheberden> like stop trac, kill those
[17:31:10] <danheberden> start trac?
[17:31:37] <mikesherov> sure
[17:31:53] <DaveMethvin> well you KNOW that reboot would cure it, we're just tryna figure out what less drastic thing would do it too
[17:31:57] <danheberden> also, are you restarting the webserver too?
[17:33:23] <mikesherov> etc/init.d/spawn-fcgi-trac stop doesn't really do anything
[17:34:04] <mikesherov> doesn't kill tracd nor fastcgi processes
[17:34:23] <danheberden> why must it be confusing
[17:34:33] <danheberden> i would think restarting the webserver would stop the processes?
[17:34:40] <danheberden> but i know not the ways of the python
[17:34:47] <mikesherov> command?
[17:35:03] <danheberden> sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
[17:36:07] <mikesherov> nope
[17:36:17] <mikesherov> we need to restart tracd
[17:36:35] <danheberden> gnarf any ideas on wtf we're doing wrong?
[17:38:16] <mikesherov> be back in 10 mins
[17:57:22] <mikesherov> back
[17:57:32] <mikesherov> danheberden: still here?
[17:57:45] <danheberden> mikesherov kind of
[17:58:17] <mikesherov> OK, I'm going to kill tracd on the server manually, because that's what it looks like the trac-bugs.jquery.com attempts to do
[17:58:49] <danheberden> ok
[17:59:04] <danheberden> ps aux | grep -e '[t]rac'
[18:06:16] <mikesherov> SUCCESS
[18:06:21] <mikesherov> danheberden:
