[05:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> hey mikesherov
[05:08:52] <mikesherov> so, the effects failure, looks like orkel fixed it?
[05:10:10] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov scott_gonzalez yeah looks like the effects fail is fixed http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2215
[05:10:25] <DaveMethvin> the opera fails jaubourg just fixed i think, waiting on a job to run to confirm
[05:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know what's going on with Opera 12?
[05:10:39] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it won't load jquery-git.
[05:10:48] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg is on it
[05:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:10:58] <DaveMethvin> it was a fix i landed yesterday 
[05:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> good job
[05:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> Stepping up your game, huh?
[05:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> Moving from "let's break a specific method the day before a UI release" to "let's break a whole browser the day before a UI release"
[05:15:27] <DaveMethvin> wait until 2.0, "lets break 3 whole browsers so they fail horribly"

[05:46:41] <jaubourg> hmmmm
[05:47:41] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: OH HAI!
[05:48:39] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: thanks, looking good so far!
[05:49:22] <jaubourg> yeah, didn't react immediately regarding manipulation
[05:50:00] <jaubourg> the swarm has too many commits to digest it seems
[05:50:10] <jaubourg> anyway, my first cherry-picking from 2.x to 1.x
[05:54:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's hope we don't have to do too much of that
[05:54:51] <DaveMethvin> although i'm an optimist
[05:55:23] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: you don't test UI against jQuery Core locally, right?
[05:55:32] <jzaefferer> I wonder if we could set that up...
[05:55:42] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: sometimes i do
[05:55:49] <DaveMethvin> but not as a general rule
[05:55:54] <jzaefferer> We've got enough problems, don't need core to screw things up
[05:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're not going to test every commit against every project.
[05:56:12] <DaveMethvin> hey we're right here for ya if you need screwing :D
[05:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> We need to get our tests consistently passing and TestSwarm running faster.
[05:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's the real problem.
[05:56:49] <DaveMethvin> +1
[05:56:53] <jaubourg> +1 scott
[05:57:29] <jaubourg> and hi guys, how may the core team make your life a nightmare today? Want us to break half of manipulation for you?
[05:57:32] * jaubourg hides
[05:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> In a perfect world, we've have mergeatron running core + UI + Mobile tests and it'd be fast.
[05:57:59] <DaveMethvin> once we get some coverage tools going I'd like to see if we can whittle down our unit tests to eliminate over-tested areas 
[05:58:33] <jaubourg> not certain we over-cover that much
[05:58:36] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15danilsomsikov opened pull request #1122: Update src/data.js (06master...06patch-1)  02http://git.io/0kLWHQ
[05:58:50] <jzaefferer> Well, when tests pass, they finish faster, as we don't have to wait for reruns and eventual timeouts
[05:58:55] <DaveMethvin> patch-1 ... here come trouble!
[06:00:31] <jaubourg> jzaefferer: true but on the other hand, testswarm is here to test stuff... failure can and will happen. What I don't like about the swarm is how unpredictable the ajax tests can get when they're performed concurrently by several browsers at the same time
[06:00:34] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Are you suggesting that mergeatron would run tests faster than Jenkins trigger plugin?
[06:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: No.
[06:00:55] <Krinkle> ok
[06:00:58] <jaubourg> hey Krinkle :)
[06:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm saying that in a perfect world, megeatron would actually be running all three test suites for everything that happens in core.
[06:01:16] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: ajax tests become unpredictable when ran concurrently? How does that happen?
[06:01:35] <Krinkle> yeah, how is concurrency an issue there?
[06:01:37] <miketaylr> scott_gonzalez: pong
[06:01:41] <miketaylr> (was in a mtg)
[06:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> miketaylr: Was going to ask if you knew what was going on in Opera 12.0 with jquery-git, but jaubourg was already fixing it.
[06:02:25] <jaubourg> the 404 load tests tend to fail randomly these days... impossible to reproduce in browserstack. The only explanation I have is the concurrency... but I don't have enough skill to know exactly what the problem is
[06:02:37] <miketaylr> scott_gonzalez: k
[06:03:13] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: can you put together an overview of the issue? E.g. a ticket? Should help me or Krinkle to take a look.
[06:03:50] <jaubourg> well, the tests time out... so I'm wondering if this is not an issue with the number of accepted concurrent requests if that can make sense
[06:03:58] <jaubourg> the trouble is that I cannot reproduce
[06:04:07] <jaubourg> so it would be the worse issue ever
[06:04:16] <jaubourg> issue report that is
[06:05:10] <Krinkle> jaubourg: Example of failure?
[06:05:21] <Krinkle> I assume it is stored in testswarm
[06:05:29] <jaubourg> let me dig it
[06:06:12] <jaubourg> Krinkle: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/891391
[06:07:41] <Krinkle> jaubourg: What is the timeout?
[06:07:57] <jaubourg> this is the one today, not the first time I see something like this. It doesn't happen when you run the test manually. Always some test timing out then the assertions are ran in a test further down.
[06:08:32] <jaubourg> Krinkle: what do you mean?
[06:09:19] <Krinkle> jaubourg: After how long is that test considered timed out? 
[06:09:40] <jaubourg> no idea, I guess it's the default qUnit timeout
[06:10:04] <Krinkle> I doubt that.
[06:10:13] <Krinkle> This is no test timeout, it is an ajax time out.
[06:10:42] <Krinkle> Or..
[06:10:44] <jaubourg> well, there is no specific timeout for this test so...
[06:10:51] <Krinkle> Wait, the wording is confusing.
[06:11:04] <Krinkle> "No AJAX requests are still active" isn't an assertion. It is done from the module callback.
[06:11:06] <Krinkle> Right
[06:11:10] <Krinkle> Yeah, so it is a test timeout
[06:11:25] <Krinkle> testTimeout=20000
[06:11:32] <Krinkle> that should be more than enough
[06:12:36] <jaubourg> yeah, the only explanation I have is that somehow the server is hanging... as to why... all I can summize is that it is too busy hence my feeling the fact ajax tests are ran concurrently by several browsers may be the issue... All browsers request the same physical and logical server, right?
[06:12:49] <Krinkle> Yep
[06:12:59] <Krinkle> TestSwarm Next will address this to some regard
[06:13:13] <jaubourg> now, I clearly dunno enough, so I could very well be completely off base here
[06:13:14] <Krinkle> By not serving them from Apache but from a temporary node server.
[06:13:34] <Krinkle> Well, that is, after we refactor a whole bunch.
[06:13:38] <Krinkle> Long term ideal.
[06:13:59] <jaubourg> heh
[06:14:13] <Krinkle> Actually, we're using NGINX.
[06:14:22] <Krinkle> So it should be better at handling concurrency
[06:14:42] <Krinkle> Maybe gnarf can look into scaling our one server in the mean time. Maybe there are some artificial boundries we can stretch (max connections etc.)
[06:15:36] <Krinkle> What is up with the manipulation test suite?
[06:15:44] <Krinkle> failing 3x in all browsers
[06:15:49] <jaubourg> fixed
[06:16:09] <jaubourg> a change in ajax (exceptions thrown in an event loop so not bubbling)
[06:16:09] <Krinkle> Someone didn't test locally?
[06:16:23] <Krinkle> btw, how are we at at running qunit/phantomjs for jquery core.
[06:16:49] <DaveMethvin> we need to report a bug against phantomjs
[06:16:50] <Krinkle> That would save a lot of resources and make it easy to run locally. (saving resources by running that on jenkins before testswarm)
[06:16:51] <jaubourg> someone being jaubourg + DaveMethvin... totally forgot to run the whole tests before making the PR
[06:17:13] <DaveMethvin> mergatron does it for us ... oh wait ... :(
[06:18:03] <DaveMethvin> all our real 2.0 browsers work fine with .apply( this, NodeList) but phantomjs does not
[06:18:21] <DaveMethvin> even the latest 1.8 doesn't seem to work with this
[06:18:42] <DaveMethvin> so we either need to back out our optimizations for that or get phantomjs to get with the program
[06:20:33] <jaubourg> NEVER GIVE UP! NEVER SURRENDER!
[06:25:27] <DaveMethvin> but we're fighting a PHANTOM!
[06:26:22] <jaubourg> Then we've gotta kill it before it dies... we've gotta go BACK... TO THE FUTURE!
[06:26:26] <jaubourg> err... the past...
[06:28:17] <DaveMethvin> jiggawat?
[06:28:45] <jaubourg> that would be an awesome javascript project name actually

[06:40:13] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Hm.. maybe Function#apply can be overloaded?
[06:40:36] <DaveMethvin> we don't touch objects we don't own
[06:40:46] <Krinkle> inside the test for phantomjs
[06:40:56] <Krinkle> if jQuery doesn't support browsers that don't have it, we don't care, right?
[06:41:27] <DaveMethvin> well i can see it becoming a whining point for people trying to use jquery 2.0 with phantomjs
[06:41:39] <Krinkle> jQuery doesn't support phantomjs
[06:41:43] <Krinkle> It doesn't work now either.
[06:41:56] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't work for our current unit tests
[06:42:04] <DaveMethvin> but it works fine for a jquery-based project
[06:42:07] <DaveMethvin> i use it in jquery-migrate
[06:42:24] <Krinkle> jquery doesn't rely on apply(.. NodeList) ?
[06:42:32] <DaveMethvin> only 2.0
[06:42:38] <Krinkle> that's what I'm saying
[06:42:42] <DaveMethvin> it was an optimization
[06:42:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah the unit tests fail with 2.0 and jquery-migrate
[06:42:59] <DaveMethvin> but don't fail on any supported browser
[06:43:03] <Krinkle> What I mean is, jQuery doesn't support phantomjs (the browser support is public and doesn't include phantomjs)
[06:43:12] <Krinkle> either way, whether we support is out of my interest actually
[06:43:27] <Krinkle> As long as core doesn't support it, it should be okay to hack it in the test suite.
[06:44:02] <DaveMethvin> well either we find phantomjs useful in which case others may as well, or we find it despicable and think nobody should use it :)
[06:44:09] <DaveMethvin> i think it's the former
[06:44:26] <DaveMethvin> like i say, i use it in jquery-migrate so i'm in the first category
[06:45:20] <DaveMethvin> i would hate to back out the apply nodelist optimization because of this so i'll see if we can get phantomjs to make a change
[06:46:00] <Krinkle> Sure, but I don't decide what optimisations are good for jquery core and what the browser support is. All I know is that as long as core doesn't support it, when I get to the point of implementing qunit/phantomjs in our tests for core, I will use Function#apply overload to make it pass. There is no rational argument against that as we'd be merely duckpunching a browser we don't support and ignoring the th
[06:46:00] <Krinkle> ings we don't it doesn't support.
[06:46:32] <Krinkle> we know it*
[06:48:00] <Krinkle> Though I doubt apply(, NodeList) is the only problem. Since that's new in 2.0 and we've been having phantom problems for much longer
[06:48:13] <DaveMethvin> well expecially for 2.0, I'd like to support (at least informally) many of the nontraditional places that jquery is being used like firefox/chome extensions, phantomjs, etc. That's why we're looking to make a npm package as well. Our plans for world domination cannot succeed without it!
[06:49:59] <jaubourg> today the fridge... tomorrow the WORLD!!!!
[06:50:10] <Krinkle> I'm going to make it work one way or another. I will support whatever you (plural) decide. I can understand if you wouldn't support it in core. I can also understand you find it akward that we have a need ourselves and don't admit it in core.
[06:51:12] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: btw, do you know who I can poke regarding https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/128 ?
[06:51:20] <Krinkle> Just making sure its not forgotten about
[06:51:39] <Krinkle> I see design is working actively lately on some redesigns, maybe this can be slipped it on the work to be done.
[06:51:39] <DaveMethvin> maybe ajpiano?
[06:51:54] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea what's going on with the phantomjs stuff failing in core, but really i am not sure having phantomjs running for core is a benefit. this difference highlights that it's not a browser.
[06:52:35] <DaveMethvin> well except for safari 5.1 not starting it looks like we got a clean run for 1.9
[06:52:36] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2219
[06:52:52] <DaveMethvin> so clearly jaubourg  you didn't break it well enough!
[06:52:57] <Krinkle> I'm personally surprised by the number of differences between WebKit and PhantomJS, I've had various bugs in the past. Suggests they're not re-using as much from WebKit as they should be.
[06:53:01] <Krinkle> Reinventing the wheel.
[06:53:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i wondered about that too
[06:53:36] <DaveMethvin> okay, nobody change 1.9-stable, imma make an rc out of that
[06:54:22] <Krinkle> This is your shot to become a millionare. Slip in that XSS you've been dreaming 'bout.
[06:55:23] <Krinkle> fuck, Safari workers been down for almost 48 hours.
[06:55:36] <Krinkle> Doesn't browserstack have tests?
[06:55:54] <DaveMethvin> i'm not even sure browserstack has employees
[06:55:55] <ajpiano> hmmmmmm Krinkle
[06:57:08] <ajpiano> i'll have to think on it
[06:57:49] <Krinkle> re-use the logo template for QUnit and jQuery, pick a color, write TestSwarm, icon [Ts] probably. And a tag line.
[06:58:05] <Krinkle> The only initial creative variable is the color. The rest should be all fixed afaik. 
[06:58:07] <ajpiano> poof
[06:59:00] <ajpiano> i don't think a Ts icon is really the operative move
[06:59:02] <Krinkle> If I had the time I'd be happy to do it myself (know my way around the creative suite, it's actually what I went to college for, programming got in thru the backdoor after that)
[06:59:09] <ajpiano> we don't want to look like creative suite on a slant
[06:59:18] <Krinkle> What would Ts stand for?
[06:59:27] <ajpiano> ....test swarm
[06:59:36] <Krinkle> I know, but why would it be a problem?
[06:59:51] <ajpiano> because look at our logos
[06:59:58] <ajpiano> how many of them are derivatives of other ones
[07:00:13] <Krinkle> I'm not sure I follow. What do you mean?
[07:00:28] <Krinkle> Isn't that the point? To be uniform?
[07:00:36] <Krinkle> (or unicorn)
[07:00:37] <ajpiano> i mean that simply saying "take the qunit logo and put TS" is not th answer for what the logo would be
[07:01:05] <Krinkle> well, that's how QUnit, UI, Mobile and Foundation got their logo
[07:01:35] <ajpiano> qunit, ui, mobile, and core have different logos.
[07:01:48] <Krinkle> From what I see, the latest revisions only made them more alike (straighten out the inconsistencies)
[07:01:50] <ajpiano> foundation is sharing the logo from core
[07:02:06] <ajpiano> i'm talking about the logos, not the lockups with text
[07:02:13] <Krinkle> ?
[07:02:45] <ajpiano> not the part where it says "jQuery Write Less Do More" or jQuery User Interface...
[07:02:52] <ajpiano> the actual logo itself
[07:03:41] <Krinkle> You mean the icon.
[07:03:48] <ajpiano> Krinkle: yes.
[07:03:58] <Krinkle> Right, those are different indeed. Only UI and QUnit are somewhat alike.
[07:05:14] <ajpiano> that's what i'm saying, is that i don't think the testswarm icon should just be the qunit icon with different letters
[07:05:59] <ajpiano> anyway, we'll have to think about it more
[07:06:08] <Krinkle> sure
[07:06:27] <ajpiano> we just went through this whole branding exercise that wrapped up, and i didn't realise we had overlooked testswarm :(((
[07:06:35] <ajpiano> that is* wrapping up
[07:06:52] <ajpiano> e.g. http://stage.brand.jquery.org/colors/
[07:09:25] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Looks like the text is a bit out of sync with the colors on that page
[07:09:35] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: RC without the Deferred fix?
[07:09:37] <Krinkle> e.g. the sizzle description is pasted from others (the tagline is red, not ornage)
[07:09:48] <ajpiano> Krinkle: they pushed that copy yesterday, they aren't finished
[07:09:57] <Krinkle> k
[07:10:20] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: oh darn, yeah that one should land .... can you do that? i'm in a meeting
[07:10:52] <jaubourg> I'll see what I can do but I'm that bad at merging PRs
[07:11:38] <Krinkle> ajpiano: There is an issue with the anchor links on that page, they're reloading the page instead of jumping. 
[07:11:40] <Krinkle> ajpiano: http://stage.brand.jquery.org/logos/
[07:11:45] <Krinkle> ajpiano: the links don't have the trailing slash
[07:11:53] <Krinkle> (in the sidebar)
[07:12:13] <DaveMethvin> if you have probs let me know jaubourg and i can do it in a couple of hours ... just wanted to get a clean run asap
[07:13:24] <ajpiano> Krinkle: thx
[07:14:57] <Krinkle> ajpiano: what repo is brand.jquery.org under? https://github.com/jquery/brand.jquery.org is 404
[07:15:26] <ajpiano> Krinkle: it's still private for a few more days
[07:15:28] <Krinkle> ok
[07:15:43] <ajpiano> though i guess at this point it could be public
[07:16:18] <ajpiano> but i think we wanted to finish our engagement with the company that's been doing the branding work
[07:16:23] <ajpiano> before making it fully public
[07:16:29] <ajpiano> just in order to not make them insane
[07:17:50] <Krinkle> Since when does #jquery-content exist? more channels..
[07:18:13] <ajpiano> since a bit before the dev summit
[07:18:56] <ajpiano> but if you want to talk websites it's the place to be
[07:22:22] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Hm.. there's a weird glitch on stage-org: http://stage.jquery.org/donate/ 
[07:22:31] <Krinkle> to left, stray borders peeking out the bottom
[07:22:39] <Krinkle> and a white border as well
[07:22:46] <ajpiano> i know
[07:22:49] <Krinkle> ok
[07:22:52] <ajpiano> Krinkle: this is still #jquery-dev :p
[07:25:28] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I was just wondering, would it be useful to use npm instead of submodules to load qunit in a repo?
[07:25:56] <Krinkle> It would make it easier to update probably. The downside though is accessing it from html (hardcoding the path to node_modules)
[07:26:46] <Krinkle> though if we start building it, we'll have to choice
[07:26:54] <Krinkle> no*
[07:27:26] <Krinkle> looks like browserstack just got their safari juice back

[07:45:08] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I have no clue how to cherry-pick this back into 1.9-stable... git is asking for a -m option I never heard of :/ (that's how bad I am at this PR business)
[07:45:48] <DaveMethvin> np jaubourg i will get to it soon
[07:46:32] <jaubourg> ok... it's in 2.x already, sorry for being so bad at all this
[08:23:01] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: usually "git commit --amend" is your friend
[08:23:13] <jzaefferer> you can cherry pick without extra arguments, then update as needed
[08:23:28] <jzaefferer> if the commit already exists in the repo, use `-x` to include a reference to that commit
[08:24:02] <jzaefferer> see also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui#for-committers
[08:24:51] <jzaefferer> or http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull%20Requests
[08:25:32] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: We can use `npm install` along with a little grunt-copy task that just copies the two files to where they're expected right now, replacing the submodule with .gitignore entries
[08:31:52] <jzaefferer> 3 1/2 hrs since the QUnit job was submitted: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/ :/
[08:35:38] <Krinkle> jquery ui jobs are extremely slow
[09:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We should probably ping Ariel about this: https://twitter.com/flesler/status/288690956386054145
[09:03:32] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, @flesler: Working on a polyfill for jQuery.css and jQuery.style, not too fond of the internal parameters and "special cases"
[09:04:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah i meant to remove the internal parameters from everything to make them easier to patch
[09:04:52] <DaveMethvin> we got about half of them and the ticket got lost
[09:05:13] <DaveMethvin> but then again, those are not public interfaces are they?
[09:05:50] <DaveMethvin> neither of those are public
[09:06:02] <DaveMethvin> so the patching should go in jQuery.fn.css()
[09:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we might want to find out what he's doing and why.
[09:06:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll ping him
[09:23:07] <gibson042> DaveMethvin the clean/buildFragment commit broke jquery-migrate
[09:24:29] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: yeah i expected that
[09:24:35] <DaveMethvin> we need to reverse the two there
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> orkel had a proposed implementation in a comment on the pull request
[09:25:26] <DaveMethvin> would you be able to fix that/
[09:25:27] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:26:17] <DaveMethvin> it needs a change to warnings.md as well, and i can get the upgrade guide fixed
[09:26:29] <gibson042> I'm trying to work out what form a fix will take, and in which repo
[09:26:40] <DaveMethvin> i think it would be in migrate
[09:26:54] <DaveMethvin> but let me think some more
[09:27:04] <DaveMethvin> ok, if .clean is there, don't patch it
[09:27:25] <DaveMethvin> but if it's not there, use something like orkel's approach
[09:27:36] <gibson042> there are two changes: 1) restrict the signature of buildFragment to require a document `context`; 2) remove .clean
[09:27:52] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah #1
[09:28:14] <DaveMethvin> well heck it's an undocumented function
[09:28:25] <gibson042> yeah, we're on the same page there
[09:28:46] <DaveMethvin> i'd be good leaving #1 unfixed and just providing a .clean if none is there
[09:31:56] <gibson042> I might just restore both... any objection?
[09:32:04] <DaveMethvin> none!

[14:46:51] <jaubourg> the interjection "yo!" popped into my mind
[14:47:14] <jaubourg> the swarm says we have a release \o/
[14:47:30] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[14:47:40] <DaveMethvin> i'm working on the blog post
[14:47:50] <DaveMethvin> and then will generate the code
[14:47:59] <DaveMethvin> and see how jquery-migrate is getting along
[14:48:12] <DaveMethvin> i'm not going to sleep until we have a release
[14:49:33] <DaveMethvin> here's my demo of .finish() http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/AFGgJ/
[14:50:36] <DaveMethvin> not quite sure of the utility of .stop(false, true)
[14:50:52] <DaveMethvin> i've wanted .finish() lots of times but never  .stop(false, true)
[14:53:01] <jaubourg> I worked on the queue and don't even remember what stop( false, true ) is supposed to do... THAT'S HOW GOOD YOUR API IS JOHNRESIG!!!
[14:53:09] <jaubourg> oh hi john
[14:53:12] * jaubourg hides
[14:53:44] <DaveMethvin> clearQueue, gotoEnd  but since we have clearQueue we don't really need that
[14:53:54] <jaubourg> oh wait, I'm supposed to blame this davemethvin character for the shortcomings of jQuery now...
[14:54:04] <DaveMethvin> however, it's the first boolean so it can't be elided
[14:54:18] <jaubourg> heh
[14:54:27] <DaveMethvin> parameter hockey with two booleans is a losing game
[14:54:28] <jaubourg> I like this new api in case I didn't tell already
[14:54:53] <jaubourg> it confuses people and then they need training \o/
[14:55:26] <jaubourg> we should have added a third boolean
[14:55:39] * DaveMethvin goes to get rotten apples
[14:56:07] <DaveMethvin> "enhanced beyond repair"
[14:56:13] <jaubourg> the third boolean would be called invert and would invert the logic of the two first parameters! How cool is that?
[14:56:21] <DaveMethvin> NOOOOO!
[14:56:26] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:56:39] <jaubourg> :)

[15:00:06] <jaubourg> "This plant is 'da bomb... so to speak"
[15:00:55] <jaubourg> hmmm, so I probably need to try and squash ajax and ajax/script

[17:10:26] <jaubourg> it's pretty difficult to check if an oldIE bug is still in there or not
[17:10:33] <DaveMethvin> MS has their own public tracker at connect.microsoft.com but i haven't found it to be very good

[20:09:56] <snover> DaveMethvin: helloooooo
[20:10:05] <DaveMethvin> hey dere
[20:10:08] <DaveMethvin> sooo
[20:10:36] <DaveMethvin> i heard second hand from someone that dojo "didn't work on ie10"
[20:10:43] <DaveMethvin> which sounded fishy to me
[20:11:04] <DaveMethvin> i am assuming that, like jquery, you have some bugs on it
[20:11:11] <DaveMethvin> but "didn't work"
[20:11:12] <DaveMethvin> ?
[20:11:46] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at dojo master and it looks like a bunch of ie9/10 stuff was recently fixed
[20:12:26] <snover> uh, no, it definitely works
[20:12:37] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i knew YOU would say that
[20:12:43] <DaveMethvin> tell davey the truth now
[20:13:00] <snover> well, i was the one that ran the unit tests in ie10 and wrote patches…
[20:13:05] <DaveMethvin> this is the point where i pose some questions to you like i'm oprah and you break down sobbing
[20:13:20] <snover> there was that issue with its JIT breaking stuff
[20:13:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw that one :D
[20:13:31] <snover> i don’t think that fix was backported
[20:13:42] <snover> or, well, its maybe-jit-or-maybe-something-else
[20:13:50] <DaveMethvin> but mainly, it's bizarre
[20:14:19] <snover> yeah
[20:14:21] <snover> not that bizarre
[20:14:24] <snover> if you know what i mean
[20:14:27] <snover> …
[20:14:56] <snover> but yeah i would be happy to receive any and all reports of non-working
[20:15:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm seeing you guys have backported ie10 patches into 1.6 etc
[20:15:51] <DaveMethvin> so i'm not sure what the guy was talking about
[20:16:00] <DaveMethvin> i'll try to get some more info
[20:16:17] <DaveMethvin> it just bugs me when ppl say this kind of stuff
[20:16:42] <DaveMethvin> i think they were just blaming someone other than themselves so they wouldn't need to do ie10
[20:17:09] <snover> well, i’m not saying there aren’t more bugs
[20:17:26] <snover> but as you know, “doesn’t work” is poison
[20:17:44] <DaveMethvin> no, it's a sweet sweet nectar
[20:17:53] <DaveMethvin> kind of like drinking antifreeze
[20:18:02] <snover> hmm
[20:18:11] <DaveMethvin> or eating those little silica gel packets, they're delicious
[20:18:18] <snover> oh
[20:18:19] <snover> yum
[20:18:24] <DaveMethvin> why else would they stamp "DO NOT EAT" on them??
[20:18:43] <snover> i know. reverse psychology
[20:18:52] <DaveMethvin> okay, that's all i needed to know, thanks
[20:18:53] <snover> modernizr has amd now, do you?
[20:19:10] <DaveMethvin> no, we'll get to it after 1.9 and 2.0 ship
[20:19:15] <snover> i think i saw some things about people talking about events in here a while ago and i felt kind of like :(
[20:19:27] <DaveMethvin> we have a bunch of build stuff to do
[20:19:53] <DaveMethvin> but i'm shipping these damn things
[20:19:57] <snover> i can offer advice and a test framework but no other manpower
[20:20:07] <snover> you have more manpower than i do
[20:20:19] <snover> i need to be like jdalton and you and a couple other people combined
[20:20:32] <DaveMethvin> jdalton? i'm not worthy!
[20:20:42] <snover> no COMBINED
[20:20:53] <DaveMethvin> 80% him, 20% me
[20:21:03] <snover> rewriting underscore is like rewriting all the stuff i already rewrote in my dojo2-core branch
[20:21:06] <snover> er
[20:21:07] <snover> repo
[20:21:08] <snover> whatever
[20:21:12] <snover> place of code
[20:21:20] <DaveMethvin> he's so hardcore
[20:21:42] <snover> i am trying some “peach ginger” tea right now
[20:21:48] <snover> what do you think it will be like?
[20:21:54] <DaveMethvin> just peachy
[20:21:55] <snover> i really just wanted ginger but i couldn’t find it
[20:22:18] <DaveMethvin> i really like jasmine tea but it's too much caffeine for after dinner
[20:23:26] <snover> use a green tea base instead of a black tea base
[20:23:29] <snover> silly!
[20:23:48] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, green tea seems to have more caffeine or at least it affects me that way
[20:24:04] <snover> weird
[20:24:13] <snover> must be all the -ininins that are in it
[20:24:19] <snover> you know, the good stuff
[20:24:28] <DaveMethvin> my body rebels against good stuff
[20:24:41] <DaveMethvin> that's why i drink antifreeze and eat silica gel
[20:27:24] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: read through the draft and noticed the upgrade guide for 1.9 could use some style love - it's pretty hard to read
[20:27:44] <DaveMethvin> danzik17: yeah, i really wish i could change that easily, but not at the moment
[20:28:09] <DaveMethvin> someone is working on it , should be done by next week when we ship
[20:28:22] <DaveMethvin> but thanks for reading through it!
[20:30:03] <snover> just an update
[20:30:08] <snover> the tea tastes like hot water
[20:30:13] <DaveMethvin> :(
[20:30:17] <snover> obviously i need to let it steep longer
[20:30:27] <snover> it smells very peachy though
[20:30:33] <DaveMethvin> double-bag it
[20:30:45] <snover> ew, dave
[20:30:50] <DaveMethvin> c'mon, you can afford it
[20:31:45] <snover> sure
[20:31:47] <snover> i CAN
[20:31:49] <snover> barely
[20:35:02] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: cool - one more thing and im out - the upgrade guide states the migrate plugin can be used at far back as 1.7.2, the release draft says 1.6.4
[20:35:27] <DaveMethvin> oh good catch .. i got 1.6.4 support in recently
[20:36:26] <snover> DaveMethvin: did you have your usual winter sabbatical this year?
[20:37:17] <DaveMethvin> well, kinda snover
[20:37:27] <DaveMethvin> somehow it just came and went too quickly
[20:37:40] <snover> i feel that way too
