# IRC Bot
The IRC bot, b-ot, is a helpful little minion that you can use inside the IRC room to get quick access to info from around the web.

## Using the bot
b-ot comes with a number of commands. All commands consist of the <code>`</code> (backtick) plus the trigger word. Most commands also have a shorthand single letter trigger.

You can also direct the bot to answer at someone other than yourself by appending 

	wesbos      `api slideUp @ajpiano
	b-ot        ajpiano: .slideUp(): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
