[00:02:26] <jak2000> JSP question, how click on a button open a new tab and in this new tab open a servlet, how to? thanks
[00:03:17] <xec> jak2000: wrong channel
[00:03:27] <Uhkis> this is #jquery, not #jsp (or whatever their channel is)
[00:03:38] <jak2000> from java redirect to me here
[00:04:02] <Uhkis> lol
[00:04:06] <xec> well, they suck apparently
[00:04:24] <jak2000> because isnt a JSP question right?
[00:04:34] <Uhkis> anyways, what you're talking about is just a plain link, nothing special
[00:04:35] <jak2000> open a new page with a adress? how to?
[00:04:57] <xec> like Uhkis says, if a servlet is a page with a url, just a normal link will work fine
[00:05:17] <xec> <a href="urlToServlet" target"_blank">my link</a>
[00:05:22] <jak2000> understand how to open?
[00:05:23] <jak2000> ok
[00:05:27] <xec> nothing to do with jquery
[00:05:49] <xec> but i don't really know what a "servlet" is
[00:05:56] <xec> sounds like a jsp term
[00:06:30] <Uhkis> if it's opened in a new tab, it kinda has to be some html page
[00:07:02] <hellyeah> hey
[00:07:10] <hellyeah> need some halp
[00:08:24] <hellyeah> all modal windows open right now just cvlose it and open it it wont effect other modal position. But when you refresh the page and when you close small modal windows big modal windows goes up can you help me to find ther reasom? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/135/embedded/result/
[00:09:45] <jak2000> i have this html code: <button onclick='reimpRecibo(this.id); return false;'                                              "type='button'>ReImp Recibo</button> and in the javascript function: window.location = "servletSalida?idocId=" + wxid; how to involve the "_blank" attribute?
[00:10:36] <hellyeah> delaying execution of close can solve problem may be
[00:11:08] <hellyeah> what do you think?
[00:11:16] <xec> jak2000: please don't cross-post. it looks like you're already getting help in #javascript
[00:12:01] <hellyeah> any ideas?
[00:16:23] <jak2000> no answer by moment xec
[00:17:56] <xec> jak2000: you can't "involve the _blank" in javascript, because it isn't javascript. it's html. just make a simple link instead of a button. you can't manipulate tabs from javascript afaik
[00:18:20] <jak2000> and with jquery?
[00:18:37] <xec> jquery is a javascript library
[00:20:12] <jak2000> ok
[00:20:15] <jak2000> goodnight
[00:20:48] <hellyeah> xec: do you have any help for me?
[00:20:54] <xec> hellyeah: no
[00:21:11] <hellyeah> okey
[00:21:15] <xec> :D
[00:21:25] <hellyeah> :XD
[00:21:48] <hellyeah> you may not know modal window not a problem thanks anyway

[00:33:48] * hd1 rages against Javascript
[00:34:27] <symfonyuser> Hi. I need a jquery selector for this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/42k248u8/3/ . Selector is intended to store position of the index (0, 1 or 2 in this case), so then I can capture right value of module if present in the table.
[00:36:01] <hellyeah> pom:
[00:36:16] <hellyeah> do you know the differ3ence between fit and flip and fitflip
[00:36:24] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/position/
[00:36:49] <curses> Hi all. I'm having some trouble getting the offset() values of a dynamically placed element (placed into the dom after the window has loaded), currently it's just returning 0. Is it not seeing this element?
[00:37:43] <pom> hellyeah, I know what it says in the docs.
[01:34:30] <MrButh> test
[01:34:57] <MrButh> is there a way to make all of the children in an element fit to the parent element? if 3 children then 33% each, if 4 then 25% each etc.
[01:35:46] <Uhkis> #css
[01:36:41] <MrButh> yeah I just realized table-cell... for some reason I thought js would be required
[01:36:42] <MrButh> thanks
[02:08:06] <Duikb00t> https://www.weblounge.be/ suggestions how tot first scroll animation is done?
[02:43:52] <tuskkk___> what is the correct way to append loads of html on ajax success?
[02:44:19] <tuskkk___> the task is handled well by php, but need to show the result instantly, and there is loads of html for that
[02:44:32] <tuskkk___> so how do we deal with it?
[02:45:12] <rekahsoft> Hi all, I am having an issue understanding the behaviour of the .load method. I am attempting to use it to insert a fragment of a entire html page but it seems to strip out the html from head and inserts it along with the selected framgement. How do I get just the html in the selected element.
[02:45:38] <tuskkk___> for example, this panel body needs to created on ajax success, http://jsfiddle.net/u847902j/
[02:46:25] <rekahsoft> I am using something like $('#wrap').load('/some-page.html #content')
[03:11:48] <Uhkis> rekahsoft: use $.get and only insert what you need
[03:13:06] <rekahsoft> Uhkis: I was inserting just one div which contained everything I needed..for some reason it would also insert the content of the head of the downloaded document
[03:14:57] <rekahsoft> I managed to solve the issue by using $.ajax (could have used $.get but was using $.ajax before trying .load) and $.parseHTML
[03:15:11] <rekahsoft> Uhkis: Thanks for the tip :)
[03:15:28] <Uhkis> well .get() is just shorthand to .ajax()
[03:16:56] <rekahsoft> yup :)
[03:38:07] <Seldon75> if I execute jQuery("body") in the console, I get an array containing one element, which is the html for the body element
[03:38:17] <Seldon75> instead of an object, which is what I expected
[03:38:26] <Seldon75> can anyone tell me what I've done wrong?
[03:39:23] <Tennis> doesn't sound like you've done anything wrong
[03:39:40] <Tennis> the object isn't too dissimilar from an array
[03:40:11] <Tennis> try a different browser perhaps to get your desired results
[03:40:24] <Tennis> firefox
[03:40:38] <Seldon75> I'm loading the jQuery script, then the blockUI script, then trying to call: jQuery("body").blockUI({});
[03:41:01] <Seldon75> but the object returned from the selector doesnt have any functions
[03:41:40] <Tennis> I wouldn't expect body to contain functions
[03:41:51] <Tennis> but I no nothing about blockUI
[03:41:53] <Tennis> so i'm tagging out
[03:42:31] <Seldon75> shouldnt the selector be returning the body as an element, adorned with the functions that get added by jQuery?
[03:46:03] <Uhkis> Seldon75: what jquery version are you using?
[03:46:22] <Uhkis> i'm getting regular jquery object with jQuery('body')
[03:47:19] <Seldon75> Uhkis: jQuery v2.1.3
[03:49:07] <Seldon75> weird
[03:49:29] <Uhkis> really weird
[03:49:36] <Uhkis> maybe you have some plugin breaking it?
[03:50:32] <Seldon75> maybe I guess
[03:50:37] <Seldon75> in the console it returns:
[03:50:45] <Seldon75> [<body class="not-front" cz-shortcut-listen="true" style="zoom: 1;">...</body>]
[03:51:22] <hellyeah> hey there
[03:51:52] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/173/embedded/result/ when you close modal window on the up it pulls the model up how can i avoid that?
[03:55:57] <tuskkk___> I appended some html on ajax success, now why isnt the previous written ajax working on this new html?
[03:56:43] <tuskkk___> for examaple, there was a href which was getting data using ajax, now this href if formed on a success call of which the ajax isnt working
[04:13:40] <PANTOLON> taplar: are youı ther e can i ask smt?
[04:14:46] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/173/embedded/result/ when you close modal window on the up it pulls the model up how can i avoid that?  or other way around can you check?
[04:15:02] <taplar> i'm semi here, :)
[04:16:05] <hellyeah> okey i am trying already you may give me an idea :)
[04:17:56] <tuskkk___> jquery events arent working on the html returned by an ajax call
[04:18:34] <tuskkk___> tried using delegate instead of on, ajax stopped completely
[04:18:43] <taplar> hellyeah: your positioning things with position relative.  they will adjust if other things change their starting position
[04:18:54] <taplar> tuskkk___: fiddle
[04:18:55] <taplar> ?
[04:19:46] <hellyeah> do same thing when it is position:absolute give me a sec
[04:20:51] <tuskkk___> taplar: the data comes from a php server, I doubt I can show it on fiddle
[04:21:05] <taplar> i just need to see your javascript
[04:21:15] <tuskkk___> basically javascript is not working on the data that comes to that page on ajax success
[04:21:21] <tuskkk___> one sec
[04:22:09] <tuskkk___> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/L1tpxvws/
[04:22:48] <hellyeah> taplar: in the top and right side will ull up at the left and button modal window try to close modal window you will se. http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/174/embedded/result/
[04:22:52] <tuskkk___> and thsi call brings in new html, http://jsfiddle.net/L1tpxvws/1/
[04:24:11] <taplar> tuskkk___: so that click event is the one that is not working?
[04:24:24] <taplar> or what's the event not working
[04:24:28] <tuskkk___> taplar: yes
[04:24:38] <decx> i've got a new project to rebuild an old blogsite
[04:24:46] <decx> it's made with joomla and mootools
[04:24:48] <decx> what a combo
[04:25:09] <tuskkk___> taplar: the delete-folder one
[04:25:11] <decx> party like it's 2008
[04:25:11] <taplar> i've only heard of one of those
[04:28:05] <taplar> ok, so to make sure i understand
[04:28:35] <taplar> the first part gets the contents of a folder and displays it?  and the delete should be bound to elements in the new displayed folder data?
[04:29:03] <taplar> bound to some element in #folder-content?
[04:30:35] <tuskkk___> taplar: yes
[04:30:58] <taplar> ok, in that case what is most likely your problem is your not binding to the new elements, since your binds are not delegates
[04:31:35] <tuskkk___> ok, so how do I correct it?
[04:31:39] <taplar> you'll either need to convert to use delegates, or execute the binds after the new elements have been added to the page
[04:32:09] <taplar> since your adding your content to an existing #folder-content, i'd think you could just delegate off of that
[04:32:31] <tuskkk___> how?
[04:33:00] <taplar> $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, handlerCallback)
[04:33:28] <tuskkk___> ok, let me try that
[04:34:05] <tuskkk___> I do this to all on events?
[04:34:26] <taplar> any that need to be bound to your dynamically added content
[04:35:02] <taplar> the problem is at the point that you try to bind, the elements don't exist yet, so they can't bind to them
[04:35:37] <taplar> using a delegate, it catches the bubbled event on the parent, which then checks to see if it happed on a specific child and if so, applies the handler for the child with the event
[04:35:51] <taplar> and since the parent is doing it, it does not matter if the children change
[04:38:10] <hellyeah> taplar: will you help me little bit .D
[04:38:15] <tuskkk___> taplar: tried this, $('.panel-body').on('click', '.folder-link',function(e) {
[04:38:21] <tuskkk___> but its still the same
[04:38:49] <taplar> is .panel-body a pre-existing parent to the content that will be added?
[04:39:14] <tuskkk___> oh
[04:39:22] <taplar> has to exist, has to be a parent
[04:39:27] <tuskkk___> no, can I add the parent of panel body?
[04:39:40] <taplar> ^ so long as it meets those two criteria, anything is good
[04:40:04] <taplar> well, 'will work', good is relative
[04:40:35] <tuskkk___> awseme! thanks a lot taplar!
[04:41:09] <taplar> ok hellyeah what's yours again?
[04:42:31] <`ULT> hi, I try to join the channel #php

[06:55:48] <Dr-007> anyone uses the bootstrap confirmation script?
[06:56:45] <Vukan> anyone using pjax here?
[06:56:47] <Vukan> i have problem after pjax reloads container succesfuly there are some events missing from DOM
[06:56:51] <Vukan> and some simple jquery is not working, among them $("#w0").submit(); so i can't auto submit my form on checkbox click
[07:19:29] <Dr-007> .find("td.empty.message") this does not find my element. it is a <td class="empty message"></td>
[07:31:57] <scri66le> i keep getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '66' in Array when looping through array
[07:32:01] <scri66le> anyone know why?
[07:37:58] <scri66le> ??
[07:44:30] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  How can I detect if a find() call was successful?
[07:44:50] <MarcGuay> the returned element .length?
[08:04:42] <jimmyff> Hey, I'm just experimenting with the html5 async property on my javascript script tags to reduce blocking on loading. Of course now I've created a race condition and jquery ready is failing with "$ is not defined" - any ideas how to avoid this other than just loading jquery synchronously?
[08:11:43] <jimmyff> bump
[08:11:45] <jimmyff> :D
[08:11:48] <jimmyff> anyone about?
[08:12:39] <shoky> jimmyff i donno much about async tags, but a common way to go is to just put all your <script>s at the end of <body>
[08:15:27] <danieli> jimmyff: you could make a self-calling function (recursive function) which waits until jQuery is defined
[08:15:43] <danieli> also, I suggest just asking and waiting, if people know + want to answer, they will
[08:15:56] <jimmyff> kk
[08:15:57] <jimmyff> thanks guys
[08:17:41] <sqram> When jquery does animations like slideDown, how does it know the height it has to stop at?
[08:17:55] <taplar> i believe the element needs height set on it
[08:19:01] <sqram> it doesn't :(
[08:19:17] <robertmaxrees> check the source.
[08:23:51] <robertmaxrees> iirc it's more complicated than you'd think, sqram
[08:23:55] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[08:24:54] <sqram> it is. and browsing the source is going to take some effort and a half. I'd like to know because i want to use jQuery's slideDown/up methods...but don't want to include the whole library just for that, so i wanted to implement my own, robertmaxrees
[08:25:24] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to implement your own.
[08:26:07] <robertmaxrees> the cheap way would be to grab the height on slideUp and stick that on a data attribute or something.
[08:26:28] <robertmaxrees> and then implement your own animation, etc.
[08:26:29] <sqram> the element starts hidden though.
[08:26:43] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could do a custom build of jquery to just include those bits and pieces.
[08:26:48] <taplar> hidden element should still have offsetHeight no?
[08:27:00] <sqram> im going to try to show, grab heigh, hide, then loop to animate
[08:27:12] <sqram> hopefully the show/grab height/hide will be fast enough to not flick
[08:27:25] <taplar> position it off screen
[08:27:36] <sqram> wai ti could clone the elment
[08:27:51] <sqram> yeah good diea.
[08:28:19] <shoky> jimmyff: wow and after this good read i'd say to indeed stick to my suggestion of putting it at end of <body>. that's the article's conclusion  http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/
[08:28:30] <sqram> and i can't type today. Anyhow, robertmaxrees is that even possible? i looked at the source the jquery doesnt seem loosely coupled. don't think i can just take out what i need
[08:29:38] <shoky> jimmyff: another good option is to use something like browserify and npm modules. jquery is one such module
[08:30:34] <taplar> sqram: i would imagine the jquery library would reuse other written jquery functions as to not reinvent the world every time
[08:31:55] <sqram> correct
[08:49:01] <taplar> blah, playing around http://jsfiddle.net/w93jsvkp/1/
[08:49:24] <robertmaxrees> no but see he doesn't want to use jquery.
[08:49:52] <taplar> i know, just was lazy, heh.  so rip out the jquery and do something like that with plain jane
[08:58:09] <Maarten> Hi, whats your guys' favourite jQuery slider? I'm looking for one where I could apply a grid to and dynamically set the amount of items visible on the screen, that is responsive
[08:58:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean a carousel?
[08:58:37] <onr> synonyms
[08:58:44] <robertmaxrees> i disagree :)
[08:58:48] <taplar> well, it could also be an accordian
[08:58:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[08:58:52] <taplar> so it's clarification
[08:58:54] <robertmaxrees> this is a slider :)
[08:59:18] <Maarten> Oh yeah I mean a carousel :P
[08:59:34] <robertmaxrees> have you considered NOT using a carousel?
[09:00:22] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ for a good arguement to not use one.
[09:00:45] <taplar> lol, it's all the rage that now we have a site against it, ^_^
[09:00:55] <robertmaxrees> i see less and less use.
[09:00:58] <Maarten> I don't have much choice, its in the design, I'm currently experimenting with Flexslider and BxSlider
[09:00:59] <taplar> oh?
[09:01:00] <robertmaxrees> and that site's been around a looong time.
[09:01:21] <Maarten> but the width is either 100% or one in PX
[09:01:31] <robertmaxrees> Maarten oh... welp.  what's this about a grid?
[09:01:34] <onr> i'd love to use a jquery carousel plugin that works without JS enabled
[09:01:49] <robertmaxrees> onr that... can't exist.
[09:02:08] <onr> YES BUT I WANT
[09:02:09] <Maarten> A grid within a carousel, basically each grid element must be slide.
[09:02:27] <taplar> i like how that carosel rotates faster than you can comfortably read the text.  was that intentional?  heh
[09:02:33] <Maarten> So I can set 4 slides to be visible for desktops, and only 1 slide visible for mobile
[09:02:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar too fast for you, maybe.
[09:02:50] <robertmaxrees> Maarten you'll need to look for a responsive carousel, then.
[09:02:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't know of any though.
[09:03:48] <Maarten> Just found http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/ by using 'carousel
[09:03:57] <Maarten> instead of slider in Google, that one seems perfect actually haha
[09:04:03] <onr> doesn't bootstrap3 have a carousel? it's a HTML/CSS framework claims to be responsive
[09:04:51] <dude999> hi i am learning validation on form
[09:04:52] <Maarten> onr, it is indeed responsive but you cannot have a variable amount of grid items within a slide
[09:05:17] <dude999> any recommendation would be appreciated
[09:05:23] <Maarten> I guess using a lot of display:none's would be a possibility but too messy for my liking
[09:05:42] <onr> hmm
[09:06:00] <dude999> i am struggling with it for about three days already, i use bootstrap and jquery, i don
[09:06:00] <taplar> dude999: what kind of validation are you talking about?
[09:06:02] <onr> then i'd need to find a carousel as well. i was planning to use bootstrap's one xD
[09:06:35] <onr> dude999: there are frameworks, or you can just use regex if you need a simple solution
[09:06:44] <dude999> i am struggling with it for about three days already, i use bootstrap and jquery, i don't want to use plugin for validation because i am learning so what are ur guide since i am newbie in term of jquery and javascript
[09:06:53] <robertmaxrees> dude999 jquery validate is a good call.
[09:07:35] <taplar> and still validate on the backend
[09:07:44] <Maarten> dude999 if you want to write your own jQuery Validate plugin you could checkout the source code of existing plugins
[09:07:47] <robertmaxrees> dude999 jquery validate is pretty solid.  you also need backend validation, so start there.
[09:08:14] <dude999> robertmaxrees: wasn't validate() is part of the another validation plugin
[09:08:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking about http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[09:08:41] <robertmaxrees> validation is a big PITA to try to handle on your own.
[09:09:16] <dude999> however i am still learning
[09:09:38] <robertmaxrees> okay?  not really sure how that's relevant :)
[09:09:48] <taplar> you can always dig into the source to see how they do it
[09:09:54] <taplar> but as far as reinventing the wheel, why?
[09:10:28] <robertmaxrees> don't reinvent the wheel in this case.  it's really not worth it.
[09:10:36] <dude999> u would recommend newbie to start by using plugin like that? my senior would not u know appreciate that
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:11:15] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to say that your sr. dev would tell you to try and write your own first?
[09:11:27] <dude999> yes
[09:11:28] <dude999> yes
[09:11:36] <robertmaxrees> as a sr. developer, that's crazy.
[09:11:50] <robertmaxrees> and a waste
[09:12:36] <dude999> i been stressing up myself for days upon that
[09:12:48] <dude999> and i could figure a way out
[09:12:58] <dude999> i mean i could not
[09:12:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate is your way out :)
[09:15:10] <dude999> robertmaxrees: using the plugin would have mean that plugin over plugin right since jquery is already a javascript plugin and then we use another plugin isn't that will make the site slow when implementing on real project
[09:15:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:15:32] <robertmaxrees> using a plugin !== a slow site.
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> if you abuse too many, maybe.
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> but in this case, it's validation.  it's not that intensive.  and somebody already did all the hard work for you - make use of their efforts.
[09:17:02] <dude999> u know am a starter, i just start my career for about three month
[09:17:26] <dude999> so pretty much thing going on in my head, and lots of question
[09:17:43] <robertmaxrees> great!  now's the best time to start learning things like this :)  jquery validate is a great place to start for form validation.
[09:18:13] <dude999> i would try to used it and robertxmaxrees thank you so much i would like to chat u private so i could ask more
[09:18:20] <dude999> u mind if i do that?
[09:18:23] <robertmaxrees> just ask here in the channel.
[09:18:25] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's for :)
[09:18:32] <dude999> okay
[09:24:07] <dude999> robertmaxtrees: could u explain the process about why we have to set boolean true and false when submitting our form
[09:24:21] <robertmaxrees> dude999 not sure i understand what you're referencing.
[09:25:53] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/ncs28kww/ been a while since i've done jq, can anyone tell me what is wrong with this very simple example
[09:26:13] <robertmaxrees> anew that's not how you use jsfiddle.
[09:26:42] <robertmaxrees> anew https://jsfiddle.net/ncs28kww/1/
[09:27:04] <dude999> at first time when i try to do it my way when i suppose to display error message if i don't use the eventPreventDefault(); i could not out error message properly it will come out but it will immediately gone
[09:27:11] <anew> hmm yeah but this is not how it is organized on page, so how do i figure out what is wrong with my site html robertmaxrees
[09:27:44] <robertmaxrees> anew you need to wrap the js with a document ready or place it before the closing body tag.
[09:28:11] <anew> ah... ok ... so if i place <script></script> right before </body> i dont need document ready?
[09:28:19] <robertmaxrees> andrew9183 basically.
[09:28:29] <robertmaxrees> dude999 i have no idea what you're talking about.  make a fiddle or something.
[09:28:37] <anew> is andrew9183 me?
[09:28:44] <robertmaxrees> err, anew - sorry :)
[09:28:48] <anew> lol k thx
[09:28:51] <dude999> okay
[09:31:07] <anew> robertmaxrees, what is the reasoning why it works before </body> ?
[09:31:20] <robertmaxrees> anew same reason document ready works - the html doesn't exist yet.
[09:31:47] <anew> but doesnt the html not exist anywhere before </body> ?
[09:31:53] <robertmaxrees> you could put your js right after your html code, even.
[09:32:21] <robertmaxrees> like, your scipt tag could go right after that <p> even, though that's a terrible idea.
[09:33:35] <anew> so it can go only before </body> no where else... or anywhere else
[09:33:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> you can put it in <head> and wrap in in a document ready.
[09:34:10] <anew> right, but without document ready
[09:34:19] <robertmaxrees> then i'd put it before the closing body tag.
[09:34:24] <anew> why does <script></script> what i have written only work before </body>
[09:34:36] <anew> because other places in the document (without document ready) it doesnt work
[09:34:49] <robertmaxrees> it'll work if you put it right after the <p> tag.
[09:34:53] <anew> weird
[09:35:06] <dude999> hello robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/meily/7j7xofn7/ here is the fiddle
[09:35:12] <robertmaxrees> the document hasn't rendered that part by the time it runs the JS otherwise.
[09:35:44] <robertmaxrees> dude999 i thought you were using jquery validate?
[09:36:27] <dude999> in fact this is the first one that now plugin is used
[09:36:39] <robertmaxrees> you're not using it.
[09:37:23] <robertmaxrees> anew not really.  the document has to be ready.
[09:37:45] <dude999> robertmaxrees: i will use it however please let me know what have i done wrong here first so i can understand my mistake
[09:37:53] <robertmaxrees> you'd normally put some scripts in <head> and others right before </body>
[09:38:05] <robertmaxrees> dude999 you're not preventing the submit when there's an error.
[09:38:42] <dude999> so that's mean i need to declare a variable to be boolean right
[09:38:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:39:23] <taplar_lunch> you could find on the form elements have have the error class. length > 0, don't submit
[09:39:40] <robertmaxrees> but really, use jquery validate.
[09:39:51] <taplar_lunch> ^
[09:40:21] <dude999> okay :)
[09:41:12] <dude999> thanks you so much guys this channel is super helpful
[09:41:18] <onr> jquery validate looks cool
[09:41:29] <onr> i was planning to use regexes
[09:41:36] <taplar_lunch> egh
[09:41:59] <onr> i like jquery for this reason.
[09:42:31] <dude999> if i want to understand the core concept for learning purpose would you guys help to explain more on that plugin
[09:42:32] <dude999> ??
[09:42:47] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[09:42:48] <dude999> i mean the jquery validate plugin?
[09:43:05] <robertmaxrees> we can help you implement it if that's what you mean.
[09:43:13] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy setup.
[09:44:22] <dude999> i mean help to explain the process of how the plugin work behind the scene
[09:44:30] <robertmaxrees> errr..
[09:44:34] <robertmaxrees> then open the source?
[09:44:35] <dude999> am just asking so don't get mad please
[09:44:55] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the beauty - you really don't need to concern yourself much with that part.
[09:45:41] <taplar_lunch> just have you some tests, like jasmine tests, to make sure what you expect to happen happens.  how it happens, not of great importance
[09:46:19] <dude999> i see
[09:46:36] <robertmaxrees> you can treat it basically like a black box.  if you want to dump through the source, feel free, but make sure to ask specific questions in here - don't ask us "how does it validate names?" - does that make sense?
[09:47:11] <dude999> robertxmaxrees: u won't change name would u if i come here next time and yes that make sense i would try to use the right question
[09:47:32] <robertmaxrees> cool - we're all about helping.
[09:47:40] <taplar_lunch> lol, most of the names here are same ol same ol
[09:47:52] <dude999> yes thanks bros cheers
[09:48:18] <dude999> am off to implementing it now and dive in
[09:48:34] <onr> helpful channel <3
[09:48:42] <dude999> <3
[09:48:42] <dude999> <3
[09:49:07] <onr> i hate channels where people refer to Google whenever you ask something
[09:49:27] <robertmaxrees> we don't shy away from telling you to do that when it's a really basic question.
[09:49:35] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise, people usually just need some guidance.
[09:49:51] <taplar_lunch> or confirmation, ^_^
[09:49:56] <onr> sure but more than often i want to talk more on the topic, like adding additional questions
[09:50:01] <onr> yeah, and guidance
[09:50:10] <robertmaxrees> sure - good questions are the impetus behind that,
[09:50:46] <onr> even "search this this this keywords on google" is much better better than "use google"
[09:52:05] <robertmaxrees> if the question is bad enough, i'm not afraid to say that ;)
[09:52:08] <taplar_lunch> lol, hey, use google is not as bad as links to lmgtfy
[09:52:24] <onr> hehe right
[09:53:17] <hlvwrk> hehe.
[09:53:18] <hlvwrk> O_o
[09:53:22] <robertmaxrees> TEE HEE
[09:53:47] <hlvwrk> HEHEHehe
[09:53:52] <robertmaxrees> hue
[09:53:58] <onr> jajaja
[09:54:05] <taplar_lunch> someone spike the punch?
[09:55:35] <taplar> speaking of laughter.  someone mentioned the other day that there were statistics done and now 'hehe' is more popular than 'lol'.  to which i said, 'sadly someone got paid to do that research'
[09:55:50] <hlvwrk> there was punch? :(
[09:55:52] <robertmaxrees> sort of - facebook.
[09:56:21] <hlvwrk> taplar, i'm more concerned with the scientists that are being paid to find cures to diseases but ... making no advances.
[09:56:23] <hlvwrk> tbh
[09:56:40] <taplar> eh, i'm sure it's not an easy job
[09:57:09] <hlvwrk> the amount of money thrown at researching cancer cures... it's a joke that nothing has come out of it yet.
[09:57:28] <hlvwrk> IE: pink fund. what a joke.
[09:58:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not for cancer cures iirc.
[09:58:52] <hlvwrk> they help fund 'finding a cure'
[09:59:01] <hlvwrk> probably not the right forum to talk about this
[09:59:02] <hlvwrk> sorry
[09:59:03] <hlvwrk> ;p
[09:59:11] <robertmaxrees> yep ;)
[09:59:18] <robertmaxrees> really bad topic of convo here ;)
[09:59:22] <taplar> it was a tuesday, when hlvwrk gave everyone a case of the bummers
[09:59:27] <hlvwrk> lol
[09:59:33] <hlvwrk> sorrys.
[09:59:38] * hlvwrk goes away :(
[09:59:50] <taplar> and you wonder why you didn't get any punch
[10:01:33] <onr> related, https://8ch.net/b/src/1439281728169.webm
[10:02:43] <hlvwrk> 8ch. Risky click.
[10:02:47] <hlvwrk> :9
[10:02:48] <taplar> what?  you've never seen a guy beating his pipe before?
[10:03:01] <hlvwrk> another reason why that's a risky click. ^
[10:03:10] <hlvwrk> lol
[10:03:32] <taplar> with...... shoes?  none the less
[10:04:53] <taplar> i have the sound off, but it would be hilarious if he was playing 'don't worry be happy'
[10:05:23] <onr> omh. he's playing that one
[10:05:39] <onr> how could you tell? from rhythms?
[10:05:57] <taplar> yeah right, he's not even trying to do the harmonies
[10:06:10] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[10:06:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd really suggest not linking to nsfw places in general...
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[10:08:23] <onr> right. play the video and close the page. 8ch is far from safe for any place but your basement
[10:09:08] <taplar> 'tornado!  go to the basement!!' 'sweet, 8ch time'
[10:09:42] * onr hehes
[10:11:09] <taplar> much safer place, just peruse thecodinglove
[10:15:47] <oste> anyone out there using hammer.js?
[10:15:56] <robertmaxrees> lots of folks probably are.
[10:16:04] <oste> wondering how to get it so it won’t block vertical events
[10:16:28] <Sal> hi
[10:16:53] <oste> trying to attach a vertical pan event to the document body, but when you do that hammer.js blocks all scrolling
[10:16:56] <Sal> how can i select a previous or next div of same class?
[10:17:12] <Sal> at same level but not necessary right before or after
[10:17:36] <taplar> uh, siblings(selector) maybe?
[10:18:08] <Sal> that get's all
[10:18:18] <Sal> i just want the previous if any and the next if any
[10:18:24] <oste> $(‘.test).next(‘.test’)
[10:18:39] <Sal> let me try
[10:19:04] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/prev/
[10:19:10] <robertmaxrees> "Description: Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector."
[10:20:38] <Sal> ok, but prev and next work on on elements inside the same parent
[10:20:46] <Sal> let me explain better
[10:21:32] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's getting siblings.
[10:21:41] <Sal> i have: <section><header/><list/></section>
[10:21:43] <Sal> <section><header/><list/></section>
[10:21:44] <Sal> <section><header/><list/></section>
[10:21:49] <robertmaxrees> rrr.
[10:21:51] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[10:21:58] <Sal> how can i got from header to header
[10:21:59] <robertmaxrees> multi-line pasts are a no-no :)
[10:22:22] <taplar> so, from one second header to another?
[10:22:27] <robertmaxrees> .index()
[10:22:36] <robertmaxrees> then add one or subtract one and use .eq()
[10:23:04] <Sal> great!
[10:23:17] <Sal> so index returns the index of the current header
[10:23:24] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:23:33] <Sal> and then eq(index -1) gets the previous?
[10:23:39] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:23:51] <Sal> great
[10:24:01] <Sal> and if there isn't any? previous?
[10:24:11] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[10:24:18] <Sal> will it go in error?
[10:24:22] <robertmaxrees> check the docs for .eq() and .index()
[10:24:26] <Sal> if the current is the first
[10:24:34] <Sal> and then i call eq(index-1)
[10:24:49] <Sal> ok, thanks
[10:25:30] <etteba15_> hello
[10:25:47] <taplar> hola
[10:26:01] <etteba15_> hello guys!
[10:26:16] <etteba15_> its my first time on here
[10:26:22] <taplar> welcome
[10:26:26] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[10:26:32] <etteba15_> I am new to jQM AND NEEDING HELP
[10:26:41] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question :)
[10:27:24] <etteba15_> ok
[10:29:05] <sk0al> So, I have a webpage that finds links that has a class of image-viewer and open the image in a colorbox. It works fine for the initial default image that loads. However on mouseenter it loads new images and these images loaded by mouseenter the colorbox does not work it just links to the image. IS there a way I can get this working?
[10:29:47] <taplar> sounds like your handler isn't being attached to the new content
[10:32:18] <sk0al> Yea, not sure what I can do. I don't have access to modify their current jquery that creates the colorbox. But somehow I have to make sure that my dynamic content does work with their colorbox
[10:32:25] <sk0al> Any ideas?
[10:32:29] <etteba15_> I am trying to develop a mobile web app using JQM the app is supposed to have a login page and after the login page a dashboard with the different sections comes up as the index page. Although I have been able to get the login and the index page to show up , I found out that I cannot transition from one page to another . I am using  a multi page format and when I click on the buttons where I use  <a href="#"> nothing happens. The pa
[10:32:38] <robertmaxrees> sk0al re-init on the new stuff?
[10:32:45] <robertmaxrees> Ethylene that cut off - make a fiddle maybe?
[10:32:46] <etteba15_> I am developing this on my Mac using Xampp
[10:32:49] <robertmaxrees> err, etteba15_
[10:33:03] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: You have any example on how that could be done?
[10:33:14] <robertmaxrees> sk0al i have no idea what your current setup looks like, so no.
[10:33:16] <sk0al> so reinit on the mouseenter function ?
[10:33:22] <taplar> sk0al: etteba15_ linking to # just stays on the page
[10:33:33] <etteba15_> yes it does
[10:33:38] <taplar> etteba15_: if you want it to do something you'll have to attach logic to do so
[10:34:41] <etteba15_> but I am using the <a href="#course">Course</a> for the button to navigate
[10:34:50] <taplar> oh
[10:34:56] <taplar> course is an anchor tag?
[10:35:10] <etteba15_> yes it is
[10:35:19] <taplar> so some where you have <a name="course"></a> ?
[10:35:29] <BlueProtoman> Which is faster; adding a bunch of different classes, or adding one class whose effects include those of those individual classes?
[10:35:32] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: There is some current jquery that looks for a.image-viewer and when you click on the link it takes the location in the href and opens the image in a colorbox. This works perfect on the first or should I say default image on the page. But once you use my mouseenter function that updates and replaces the html  element of a.image-viewer it still keeps the same class but updates the image location and changes the image . And 
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> sk0al that cut off.
[10:35:44] <etteba15_> on the page where it gets stuck if I do a refresh surprisingly the links work
[10:35:54] <robertmaxrees> sk0al make a fiddle or something.
[10:36:24] <sk0al> the page from the mouseover no longer seem to be working. I am sure its got something to do when the page loads default it scans and find that first elelment but then when it gets dynamically changed it doesn't re scan for the new updated elements
[10:36:41] <robertmaxrees> sk0al so how does the plugin init then?
[10:36:46] <robertmaxrees> and how are you loading the new content?
[10:36:52] <sk0al> from the a.image-viewer class
[10:37:06] <sk0al> on the a tag that is wrapped around the image
[10:37:17] <taplar> BlueProtoman: can you elaborate?
[10:37:32] <etteba15_> @taplar yes I do have a  <a name="course"></a> ?
[10:37:35] <robertmaxrees> sk0al by doing $('.image-viewer').somePlugin() oooor....?
[10:37:46] <sk0al> let me see if i can find it
[10:37:53] <robertmaxrees> sk0al make a fiddle.
[10:38:02] <taplar> etteba15_: k, not sure then why that link would not work
[10:38:04] <etteba15_> and its on the same page
[10:38:24] <sk0al> Not sure that its possible. Its a huge page and i don't really have access to most of the page. I am only able to access and create html for a small window inside their page.
[10:38:46] <sk0al> and this jquery they are doing to create the colorbox is basically out of my control
[10:38:58] <robertmaxrees> sk0al you can setup a fiddle that includes jq and the lib and then a thing to dynamically create elements to put colorbox on.
[10:39:05] <robertmaxrees> like, you can get the basics.
[10:45:05] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: Can I please private message you just a link to look at?
[10:45:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you didn't :)
[10:45:23] <sk0al> I just don't want url to be public we can talk here
[10:45:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you didn't send me the link, then.
[10:46:06] <sk0al> ugh, =/ not sure how I can show this to you then
[10:46:09] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[10:46:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:46:15] <robertmaxrees> a reduced test case would be perfect.
[10:46:36] <sk0al> There is no way I can dig the function out that is opening the colorbox
[10:46:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:47:05] <sk0al> so that I can create a fiddle.
[10:47:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm not asking for your exact code - i'm asking for a reduced test case.
[10:47:19] <sk0al> I can't replicate their stuff that is opening the image
[10:47:42] <sk0al> I can show what I am doing but I can't get the stuff they are doing that actually makes the image open up in colorbox
[10:48:07] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[10:48:40] <sk0al> Because they load like 200+ javascript files... can't seem to find it and would never be able to link it all together to make that part work
[10:49:08] <sk0al> maybe not quite that many but a TON
[10:49:13] <taplar> i was fixing to say
[10:49:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you could easily recreate that part on a fiddle.  otherwise, all i can tell you is to target newly created elements and reinitialize on them.
[10:51:19] <etteba15_> @taplar: were you talking to me?
[10:51:28] <taplar> nope sk0al
[10:51:33] <etteba15_> k
[10:52:08] <ekz> hey all
[10:54:30] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning!
[10:54:46] <etteba15_> anyone on m y case?
[10:56:22] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: Ok, it doesn't really work but I think you can get a really good idea. I found the stuff where they are creating the colorbox so I am showing their code and then my code and  the basic html. Let me know if this is enough info.
[10:56:24] <sk0al> http://jsfiddle.net/jbkp9pLe/1/
[10:57:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it sounds like you need to reinit the colorbox when you load in your new content.
[10:57:55] <sk0al> you have an example you could show me on how I could go about doing this?
[10:58:25] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea how colorbox is initialized and how you're loading your new content.
[10:58:39] <robertmaxrees> is the new content getting ajax'ed in?
[10:58:57] <sk0al> nope. Its being added from the mouseenter function I have at the bottom
[10:59:19] <sk0al> let me show you how I get it in there
[10:59:21] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not really looking at your fiddle because it's not really helping O.o
[10:59:36] <robertmaxrees> this is why i asked for a test case instead.
[10:59:57] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about $(".bb-image-viewer").imageViewer(); ?
[11:00:16] <sk0al> yes that is the function they have created that is opening the image in a colorbox
[11:00:34] <sk0al> so I am just adding that class to my image tags that I am creating
[11:01:15] <sk0al> so the first default images loaded works fine. But when I mouseover the swatches it changes the top images and those items no longer open in colorbox after they are changed from mouseenter function
[11:01:30] <robertmaxrees> then change that var declaration to var $BCSFrontViewHTMLx = $('<a class="bb-image-viewer" href="' + $colors[selectedColor + 'FrontFull'] + '"><img src="' + $colors[selectedColor + 'Front'] + '"\></a>'); and then do $BCSFrontViewHTMLx.imageViewer() after the .html call.
[11:01:43] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.  if it doesn't, i got nothin'.
[11:01:50] <sk0al> ok thanks let me try that
[11:48:56] <ekz> kinda quiet in here, no/
[11:48:57] <ekz> ?
[11:49:00] <ekz> :)
[11:49:04] <taplar> ups and downs
[11:49:12] <ekz> i sppose.. and people at day jobs
[11:49:41] <ekz> I'm in between... an ex-actioncsript junkie (10-years) dealing with the shift in the RIA world :)
[11:50:30] <ekz> actually had to write some jQuery as part of an 'assessment' for a new gig... turned it in earlier
[11:50:40] <ekz> anyone interested in taking a look and critiquing?
[11:51:07] <nodist> sure
[11:58:36] <rimdeker> Hey folks, can you help me out with this? http://jsfiddle.net/j26hf/101/
[11:58:45] <rimdeker> For some reason I can't show the sidebar after hiding
[12:02:21] <duch_kazatel> <div class=".rsn-toggle-button"> - extra period here :)
[12:03:08] <bango2> anyone use datatables and know what lfrtip means
[12:03:28] <rimdeker> robertmaxrees: Oh man..... thank you so much, couldn't for the life of me find the problem
[12:04:38] <robertmaxrees> bango2 https://www.datatables.net/extensions/tabletools/initialisation - under dom
[12:04:43] <robertmaxrees> show details, it's in there.
[12:05:44] <bango2> thanks robertmaxrees thats what prompted the question, idk what lfrtip represents
[12:06:21] <robertmaxrees> read the desc
[12:06:27] <bango2> i get the T to add in my tabletools buttons, but the clear, im assumking thats some sort of BR tag
[12:06:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to read the docs.
[12:06:55] <bango2> ok thanks
[12:08:12] <gl3am> Please help me, and fund the campaign: http://igg.me/at/safe-social-network/x/10854263
[12:08:15] <bango2> poking around, i believe the sfrtip is the datatable itself.
[12:08:20] <bango2> lfrtip*
[12:08:30] <robertmaxrees> gl3am not the right place to advertise :)
[12:08:52] <gl3am> sorry
[12:13:27] <mynameisbrian> When it hits max, I don't want a person to be able to type anymore except for the backbutton. When they hit the backbutton, they should be able to type again, but they can't. I've tried reversing the preventDefault() by returning true etc etc. but it's not working, any ideas? https://jsfiddle.net/v7tmsdco/
[12:14:01] <mynameisbrian> so once the character limit is below 140 they should be able to type again since they've deleted characters
[12:14:21] <mynameisbrian> It doesn't do anything for onload yet, but I haven't gotten that far
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> $('#customer-review').keydown(function(e) { - this is your problem.
[12:15:36] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're binding a listener every time you hit a key.
[12:17:04] <robertmaxrees> this is closer to what you want: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v7tmsdco/1/
[12:17:08] <robertmaxrees> need to invert some logic though.
[12:17:15] <robertmaxrees> mynameisbrian
[12:19:47] <mynameisbrian> thanks robertmaxrees!! that makes more sense.
[12:28:36] <ovnicraft> hi i am using https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/ to use data from xml file, so i want to know how i can do the same putting data in same html file ?
[12:28:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:28:55] <robertmaxrees> how are you using it?
[12:36:10] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:42:13] <onr> i love you, jquery. i regret terribly that i cheated on you with ugly Angular and React.
[12:42:26] <robertmaxrees> you didn't cheat at all ;)
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> different libraries.
[12:42:42] <SmashingX2> How can I make the legends in this code to take the whole line instead of wrapping to the next line? http://jsfiddle.net/zuda8d4c/1/
[12:42:48] <onr> tell it to angular and react. they try hard to replace jquery
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> onr not at all.
[12:43:14] <onr> please don't be THAT "dis is apples vs oranges" guy, please
[12:43:25] <robertmaxrees> but it is apples to oranges :)
[12:43:52] <onr> i won't argue.
[12:44:25] <robertmaxrees> angular even mentions they support jquery or import their own lightweight version if it's not there already.
[12:45:03] <onr> it's a trap, roberto
[12:45:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:45:34] <theCole> if (Object.prototype.toString.call(error.data.data) === '[object Array]') {
[12:45:44] <theCole> if there a better way to check if variable is an array?
[12:45:47] <onr> "they work together" doesn't mean there are no overlapping features
[12:46:02] <robertmaxrees> onr but they have to completely different purposes :)
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> theCole what's the environment?
[12:46:23] <theCole> browser
[12:46:56] <theCole> @robertmaxrees
[12:47:01] <robertmaxrees> variable instanceof Array, Array.isArray(variable), variable.constructor === Array
[12:47:05] <robertmaxrees> lots of different options.
[12:48:16] <onr> "completely different" yeah bro
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> one is an MV*, the other is a dom abstraction library.  build with different goals in mind.
[12:49:16] <onr> stop it
[12:49:34] <robertmaxrees> pardon?
[12:49:44] <onr> you just try hard
[12:49:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:49:56] <taplar> logic is hard?
[12:50:19] <onr> it's totally obvious that Angular and React are being used where one would use Jquery before
[12:50:31] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery, and sort of?
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> more that people are opting to use the right tool for the job more often now.
[12:50:50] <robertmaxrees> like they would with backbone, riot, etc.
[12:51:11] <ovnicraft> robertmaxrees, $.data('myxml.xml')
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> ovnicraft the docs tell you to avoid using that method for xml documents.
[12:52:34] <onr> i don't care what do people think is right. i use jquery instead of react for dom manipulation, and i use jquery instead of angular for data binding, "app structure", AJAXy stuff
[12:53:00] <shoky> except jquery has no data binding or "app structure"
[12:53:02] <onr> it's not like bicycle vs toothbrush. they're pretty comparable
[12:53:54] <onr> well, my script happens to have both data binding and that structure thing angular claims to have
[12:54:02] <heller__> g30
[12:54:05] <shoky> good for you
[12:54:36] <robertmaxrees> onr that's... kind of the point?  you're using the right tools for the right jobs.
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, the latter portion - that's not something that jquery really handles well.  but okay.
[12:55:59] <onr> anyway. i just don't understand why did you get offended by "jquery instead of angular/react" statement :)
[12:56:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not offended, it's not not an accurate statement.
[12:56:24] <robertmaxrees> *just not
[12:56:54] <saml> given $('<div>\n\n\nabc</div>     <div>a</div>'), how can I pretty printed string representation?   '<div>abc</div><div>a</div>'
[12:57:56] <taplar> regex?
[12:58:26] <robertmaxrees> var myText = $('<div>\n\n\nabc</div>     <div>a</div>').text().trim();
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> unl;ess you're trying to remove the extra whitespace from each element.
[12:59:06] <saml> yah i'm trying to remove extra whitespaces
[12:59:22] <saml> i guess i'll have to walk  tree and remove \s+ text nodes
[12:59:27] <mynameisbrian> why are there even whitespaces there, seems like you have a problem somewhere else
[12:59:30] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use a regex for that.
[12:59:39] <mynameisbrian> and yeah no regex for html
[12:59:54] <robertmaxrees> you should really have a root node in there fwiw.
[13:00:02] <juanjo> hi there
[13:00:34] <juanjo> can you tell me of a jquery plugin that let me do a photos slideshow but reading files from a local path?
[13:00:47] <taplar> i was thinking regex for the string representation, not the $() object
[13:00:48] <juanjo> i want to use it in my local computer, no internet
[13:00:59] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's stiull a bad idea.
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to parse markup.
[13:02:02] <robertmaxrees> you can do something like this: y
[13:02:02] <robertmaxrees> [2015:08:11:13:00:02] <juanjo> hi there
[13:02:02] <robertmaxrees> [2015:08:11:13:00:34] <juanjo> can you tell me of a jquery plugin that
[13:02:04] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:02:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9L1sa4xc/1/
[13:02:11] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[13:02:52] <taplar> hah, beat me to it
[13:03:09] <bryantt23> quick question: what is var $snowflakes = $(), qt = 20;
[13:03:11] <bryantt23> is it a constructor?
[13:03:19] <bryantt23> http://jsfiddle.net/MzVFA/3/
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> bryantt23 nope.  that's setting two vars.
[13:03:21] <bryantt23> thanks
[13:03:39] <robertmaxrees> bryantt23 $slowflakes = $(); iscreating a new, empty jquery object.
[13:04:01] <robertmaxrees> qt = 20 creates a var called "qt" whose value is "20"
[13:04:19] <taplar> initial create is kinda pointless as you create one in the loop
[13:04:28] <bryantt23> so it is instantiating it
[13:04:34] <bryantt23> to put in data later
[13:04:35] <bryantt23> ?
[13:04:43] <robertmaxrees> taplar actually that's a redundant setup.
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> since for loops don't have scope, so that var statement has no business there
[13:05:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/MzVFA/565/ just like this.
[13:05:20] <taplar> ah, snap, i thought it had an s for a second
[13:05:27] <robertmaxrees> bryantt23 it creates a new jquery object, yeah. that's running a constructor under the hood, but you're not directly doing that yourself.
[13:06:07] <taplar> anyway, i'm out peeps.  thanks for the snow
[13:06:11] <bryantt23> ok thanks
[13:06:11] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeee
[13:06:34] <mynameisbrian> bryantt23, a constructor is: var hello = new Greeting(); learn JavaScript, then learn jQuery afterwards if you want to know these concepts
[13:06:50] <mynameisbrian> it's much easier that way
[13:07:08] <robertmaxrees> eh, you can learn jquery and use it up front, but I agree you should still learn javascript, too.
[13:08:37] <mynameisbrian> I like learning it all separate, made it much easier for me. I learned core concepts like variables, objects, constructors, etc etc. then I learned client-side JS, and then other frameworks and libraries like jQuery. but everyone has their own way of doing it
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:09:23] <robertmaxrees> part of what makes jquery fantastic is is empowers and enables people to do things with very little understanding up front.  that's a double-edged sword, but i'd like to think it's mostly a good thing :)
[13:11:22] <juanjo> how can I read the content of a local path?
[13:11:52] <robertmaxrees> juanjo you can't - that's a huge security vulnerability.
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're set on making your slider, set up a basic server on your computer.
[13:12:34] <bango2> im having more issues with jquery datatables tabletools
[13:12:36] <robertmaxrees> you could even use node to do something like that.
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> bango2 feel free to ask, but keep in mind that most people here have little/no experience with datatables.
[13:13:19] <bango2> im defining a path to the swf other than the default, yet my browser tries to load the default path again! ill post pastebin
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> bango2 yeah i'd suggest you check their forums.
[13:13:40] <bango2> http://pastebin.com/gX0JxHcc
[13:34:37] <oste> anyone want to take a stab at this http://jsfiddle.net/mspos8g0/3/
[13:34:51] <robertmaxrees> at what?
[13:34:52] <oste> trying to get inner to first get -20px bottom, then animate that back up to 0
[13:35:11] <oste> notice how right now inner does not move :(
[13:35:29] <robertmaxrees> your CSS applies.
[13:35:30] <oste> i would think that it would get -20px then animate back up
[13:35:41] <oste> right but first it gets -20px
[13:35:44] <oste> then 0
[13:35:46] <oste> that should animate
[13:35:57] <robertmaxrees> no, it just sets the -20px
[13:35:59] <robertmaxrees> nothing happens.
[13:36:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mspos8g0/4/
[13:36:40] <oste> yep, now how can you animate it back up?
[13:36:54] <oste> it should actually quickly go off the screen, then animate back up
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> bind a mouseleave
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> you mean like a bounce?
[13:37:11] <oste> something like that
[13:37:28] <oste> i need to calculate the height of the div, then set it to be that much below the page
[13:37:30] <robertmaxrees> then you need to use a timeout or full .animate().
[13:37:34] <oste> then add that class so it goes to 0
[13:37:47] <oste> i still don’t understand why my first example does not work like that
[13:38:00] <robertmaxrees> css transition - your code does exactly what you're telling it to.
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> you set a style and then immediately set a class that cancels that style.
[13:38:27] <oste> so it should transition!
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> necause your other class breaks things.
[13:38:48] <robertmaxrees> bottom: 0 !important; is your headache.
[13:38:52] <robertmaxrees> use .animate() - it'll be easier.
[13:39:03] <oste> css animations FTW
[13:39:12] <robertmaxrees> then set a timeout to remove the calss.
[13:39:14] <robertmaxrees> *class
[13:39:54] <oste> but this works??? http://jsfiddle.net/mspos8g0/5/
[13:40:05] <oste> notice i have set #inner to -20px in the css
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:40:18] <oste> but i cannot do that via a style attribute it seems
[13:40:19] <robertmaxrees> look at your css.
[13:40:33] <oste> my bottom is dynamic
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> you're setting the bottom to -20px, and then adding a class that sets it to 0.
[13:40:41] <oste> that -20px will be calculated
[13:40:46] <oste> yep
[13:40:52] <oste> so it works in pure css
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mspos8g0/6/
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:41:05] <oste> but this does not work        $('#inner').css('bottom', '-20px');
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:41:14] <robertmaxrees> you're not clear on how css transitions work.
[13:41:35] <saml> how can I wrap $(x)  where x could be '<p>a</p> <p>b</p>' ?
[13:41:43] <oste> css transitions can’t involve direct style?
[13:41:56] <oste> that would be hogwash
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> oste they can, but you said you're going to calculate that value.
[13:42:02] <robertmaxrees> saml not sure what you mean
[13:42:19] <themagician> how can I get the alert() to run when clicking the button? http://jsfiddle.net/dmh1eLun/
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> themagician jQuery("#in").trigger("input"); add that after the .val() call.
[13:43:01] <saml> $('<span>a</span> <p>asdf</p>', document.createElement('div')).html() === '<span>a</span> <p>asdf</p>'    ;  this is what i want
[13:43:27] <robertmaxrees> themagician even better - move the alert into a separate function that you call in both spots.
[13:43:30] <robertmaxrees> saml that doesn't make sense.
[13:43:32] <saml> I could do  $('<div>' +  x + '</div>')   but was wondering if there's better way
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's exactly how you'd do it.
[13:43:58] <oste> robertmaxrees so do you say it’s impossible with css transition?
[13:44:00] <saml> ah thanks
[13:44:09] <oste> since i have to calculate that on my own and thus can’t use a class
[13:44:31] <robertmaxrees> oste not sure if it's impossible, but in this case i'd suggest using .animate() since it'll be a litytle easier.
[13:45:57] <oste> css animations FTW
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd be interested to see what you come up with.
[14:19:09] <bango2> how do I use jquery to get all thead th elements within $(this)  ?
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> .find('thead')
[14:28:16] <robertmaxrees> err, .find('th') i r can tipe
[14:32:37] <bango2> +1 find
[14:33:04] <bango2> worked great.
[14:38:36] <Phoenixz> Can I use domain name that contains things like %20 ?
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:38:57] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could.  i'd avoid it.
[14:42:56] <oste> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/mspos8g0/10/
[14:43:06] <oste> something like that works with css animations
[14:43:10] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:43:22] <oste> notice the timeout - gotta have that for the second one
[14:43:29] <robertmaxrees> i mentioned that earlier.
[14:43:36] <oste> but can’t mix class and inline style properties
[14:43:40] <oste> from what i understand
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> also - document.getElementById('inner').scrollHeight - you can replicate this with $('#test').offset().top
[14:43:55] <robertmaxrees> but nice.
[14:44:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, just .height()
[14:45:31] <Phoenixz> robertmaxrees: I want to avoid them, its just that I have seo-cleaned-city-name.domain.com, and if people type city names it would go to "Real City Name.domain.com"..  I will redirect to the right city string that is cleaned , but on the browser side, I either have to do the cleaning (strip spaces, accents, etc, don't like that option) or encodeURI() the city name, then send that to the server, and then the server redirects it to the correct city name..
[14:45:54] <jquery> any1 here?
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> Phoenixz you should validate that server-side, instead.
[14:46:45] <Phoenixz> robertmaxrees: Thats that I do, but the user can type the city name in a form in the browser, I would like to redirect there directly.. Eiuther that, or go to some processing page first.
[14:47:00] <jquery> my this code is not working: http://sprunge.us/WdLE ; when i write console.log(inside) i get error not defined
[14:47:22] <robertmaxrees> PhonicUK are you sending that data server-side?
[14:47:26] <robertmaxrees> err, Phoenixz
[14:47:38] <PhonicUK> that was confusing for a second xD
[14:47:41] <Phoenixz> robertmaxrees: Never mind, I've been thinking in a wrong circle
[14:47:47] <robertmaxrees> Phoenixz :) sounded like it.
[14:48:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery because inside only exists inside that function.
[14:48:13] <Phoenixz> robertmaxrees: I'll send it as POST request to a page that will redirect to the right location
[14:48:14] <jquery> yes it must fire right?
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery the console.log() will work inside that document ready.
[14:48:33] <robertmaxrees> but not outside.
[14:49:08] <jquery> robertmaxrees: for console.log(outside) i am getting output
[14:49:16] <Sal> doing $el.eq(-1) gives me the last element of the array
[14:49:20] <Sal> is that correct?
[14:49:28] <robertmaxrees> Sal i believe so - check the docs.
[14:49:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery right.
[14:50:40] <jquery> robertmaxrees: how do i get inside var?
[14:50:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery you can't.
[14:50:52] <robertmaxrees> it only exists inside that function.
[14:50:59] <jquery> ok
[14:51:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[14:51:12] <jquery> then how do i debug my script
[14:51:18] <robertmaxrees> a debugger.
[14:51:21] <robertmaxrees> or console.log()
[14:51:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lfoyrodn/1/
[14:51:45] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is a good guide.
[14:51:56] <jquery> robertmaxrees: i am making a slider script: http://sprunge.us/JBSH
[14:52:19] <robertmaxrees> fyi you can replace      slideshowexecution
[14:52:28] <robertmaxrees> err, that last line with setTimeout(slideshowexecution, 3000);
[14:52:56] <jquery> robertmaxrees: i want to fire that function every 3 seconds
[14:53:09] <robertmaxrees> use a recursive setTimeout call.
[14:53:18] <robertmaxrees> also, $('.slide-'.range) isn't valid.
[14:53:29] <jquery> why
[14:53:36] <jquery> i want .slide-1
[14:53:41] <robertmaxrees> then use +, not .
[14:53:46] <jquery> ok
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> you also want to use ===, not ==
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gdg0r0qe/1/
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> this is closer.
[14:54:39] <jquery> ('.slide-'+range) will give me ('.slide-1') ?
[14:54:44] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:54:55] <robertmaxrees> + is how you concat strings in js.
[14:55:06] <jquery> ok thanks
[15:06:54] <afroradiohead> is there a way to convert a jQuery element to it's selector?
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:07:07] <afroradiohead> i mean
[15:07:15] <afroradiohead> get the selector from the $element
[15:07:21] <afroradiohead> or "a" selector
[15:07:53] <robertmaxrees> not really?  you already have the element - why do you need the selector?
[15:10:07] <afroradiohead> hmm
[15:10:21] <afroradiohead> $document.on("mousedown", $element, callback)
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.  how are you getting the element initially?
[15:10:36] <afroradiohead> wait that's wrong
[15:11:00] <afroradiohead> aight let me revise my question to get what i want specifically
[15:11:24] <afroradiohead> basicallly... I was my mousedown event to occur when it doesn't happen inside an element
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[15:12:36] <afroradiohead> closest..
[15:12:37] <robertmaxrees> check if ($(this).closest($someElement)) {}
[15:12:41] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:12:54] <afroradiohead> do it inside the callback?
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code.
[15:13:17] <robertmaxrees> err, if ($(this).closest($someElement).length) {}
[15:13:34] <afroradiohead> oh yeah!
[15:13:38] <afroradiohead> closest traverses up
[15:13:42] <afroradiohead> okie doke gotcha
[15:13:48] <robertmaxrees> it starts at the current element and then goes up/
[15:13:51] <afroradiohead> that makes sense
[15:13:58] <afroradiohead> cool thanks robert
[15:14:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:28:00] <jaggzt> my .animate() doesn't seem to work in ie8
[15:28:09] <jaggzt> (using ie8 in wine to test compatibility)
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[15:28:20] <robertmaxrees> and what are you animating?
[15:28:20] <jaggzt> 1.3.something
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> O.o that's an ancient version.
[15:28:47] <jaggzt> 1.11.3
[15:28:53] <jaggzt> just was animating height
[15:28:53] <robertmaxrees> okay that's not too bad.
[15:29:02] <jaggzt> https://jsfiddle.net/9ta0q3db/16/
[15:29:11] <robertmaxrees> IE8 and jsfiddle don't agree iirc.
[15:29:16] <jaggzt> (ie8 won't load jsfiddle either..  was testing it in a separate page)
[15:29:31] <jaggzt> :)
[15:29:34] <thinkeyP> Hey! Anybody that can help me out with a regex? I want to get the text after "Rationale: " : https://regex101.com/r/qG5pF0/5 . And the text is dynamic and will change...
[15:29:36] <thinkeyP> Any ideas?
[15:29:46] <jaggzt> easy
[15:29:57] <robertmaxrees> .split(':')[1]
[15:29:58] <jaggzt> what kind of regex does jquery support?
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't - javascript does.
[15:30:12] <jaggzt> I mean, javascript :)
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> no need for a regex here.
[15:30:30] <jaggzt> do you want to guarantee it has Rationale: there, or will  "Foo: <something>" be an okay match as well?
[15:30:37] <thinkeyP> hm
[15:30:46] <thinkeyP> ok, perfect!
[15:30:57] <jaggzt> is the text all in one chunk also?
[15:30:59] <thinkeyP> I want to guarantee it has Rationale there
[15:31:05] <jaggzt> one long string?
[15:31:09] <thinkeyP> Yes
[15:31:24] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want everything including and after 'Rationale: '
[15:31:28] <thinkeyP> With the sentence after
[15:31:35] <thinkeyP> oh sorry
[15:31:41] <thinkeyP> only the sentence after Rationale.
[15:32:00] <thinkeyP> G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 09-10 August due
[15:32:00] <thinkeyP> to the influence of a positive polarity coronal hole high speed stream.
[15:32:08] <jaggzt> you'll need to handle the line termination as well then
[15:32:24] <thinkeyP> alright
[15:32:28] <jaggzt> \n\n but it might be \r\n\r\n or even \r\r
[15:32:50] <thinkeyP> okey, i'll take a look at that
[15:33:12] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[15:33:15] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[15:33:27] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the rationale btw?
[15:35:00] <thinkeyP> I need the text for an application i'm making
[15:35:34] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there'd be a better data format out there from NOAA
[15:36:19] <jaggzt> There are other ways of doing this (other than regex):   (?\n|\r)Rationale:\s*(.*?)(\n\n|\r\n\r\n|\r\r)
[15:36:34] <jaggzt> and probably faster
[15:37:23] <robertmaxrees> jaggzt so what part of your code doesn't run in IE8?
[15:38:07] <jaggzt> .split("Rationale:")[1]  will get the chunk after rationale I think.. then you'd need to find the blank line through some means and strip off the later.. but I'd personally just use a regex :)
[15:38:20] <robertmaxrees> there are multiple instances of "rationale: " btw.
[15:38:24] <jaggzt> ohhhh
[15:38:32] <jaggzt> thinkeyP, do you need all rationale's?
[15:38:40] <robertmaxrees> so it'd take a little more doin'
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably do a series of .split() calls, but that's because i hate regex that much.
[15:39:02] <jaggzt> robbyoconnor, hmm.. in ie8, how would I tell what's not running?  when I click the link it expands, but in ie8 it doesn't do anything noticable
[15:39:27] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete, and you have developer tools in IE8.
[15:39:33] <robertmaxrees> so pop them open.
[15:44:03] <jaggzt> robertmaxrees, :)
[15:44:11] <jaggzt> no errors in javascript debug mode.. hrm
[15:44:54] <jaggzt> no step debugger right?
[15:45:42] <jaggzt> looks like they made console logging no fun either
[15:45:48] <jaggzt> alert() debugging it is then?  :)
[15:46:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:46:25] <robertmaxrees> you have a console.
[15:46:30] <robertmaxrees> you have everything.
[15:47:26] <thinkeyP> I only need the first Rationale (G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are likely on 09-10 August due to the influence of a positive polarity coronal hole high speed stream.)
[15:47:59] <thinkeyP> I'll try the split!
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> even easier.
[16:01:57] <undergod> Can anybody help me with something please: http://hastebin.com/enotoxufiz.coffee its explained in the paste code
[16:02:11] <undergod> basically the .remove() is not working
[16:04:32] <robertmaxrees> because it's text.
[16:04:37] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to remove text, undergod
[16:05:00] <undergod> text? :o
[16:05:19] <robertmaxrees> msg[2].toLowerCase(); will give you a string.
[16:06:10] <undergod> and that string value matches the id which i want to remove
[16:06:16] <undergod> its not possible to do that?
[16:06:25] <robertmaxrees> then you want $('#' + canalpart).remove();
[16:07:43] <undergod> robertmaxrees, but the string already starts with #, because its a channel (irc) name
[16:08:05] <robertmaxrees> then try console.log($(canalpart).length) - what do you get?
[16:09:34] <undergod> 0
[16:09:58] <undergod> :o
[16:10:48] <undergod> dont get it
[16:11:05] <robertmaxrees> console.log(canalpart) - what does that give you?
[16:11:48] <undergod> #ola
[16:11:53] <undergod> after doing: /part #ola
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> then that selector isn't working.
[16:12:24] <robertmaxrees> it's not finding what you think it is.
[16:13:22] <undergod> can it be because iam handling that page with socket.io?
[16:13:52] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what your page is doing so i have no way of knowing.
[16:14:09] <robertmaxrees> though stuff like <li onclick="switch_channel( $(this).text() );" id="' + canaljoin + '">' + canaljoin + '</li> is pretty concerning.
[16:19:55] <undergod> robertmaxrees, i am not concerned with security yet, just trying the develop the very bases
[16:20:06] <undergod> to*
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> it's not about security - it's about that being the hard way to do it.
[16:20:52] <undergod> how so? :o
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> just use a delegated listener instead.
[16:35:33] <undergod> ITS WORKING
[16:35:34] <undergod> OH YEEE
[16:35:37] <robertmaxrees> cool
[16:35:38] <undergod> thank you
[16:35:59] <robertmaxrees> you figure it out?
[16:36:19] <undergod> the only think i had to do was define the id like: 'chan_'+canaljoin
[16:36:37] <robertmaxrees> hah, figures.
[16:36:40] <undergod> and in the part code: remove the '#chan_'+canalpart
[16:36:44] <undergod> it worked
[16:48:49] <laphlaw> I can't seem to get this to work: http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[16:49:03] <laphlaw> TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating '$( "div.demo-container" ).html( "<p>All new content. <em>You bet!</em></p>" )')
[16:50:19] <robertmaxrees> is jquery defined?
[16:51:13] <laphlaw> robertmaxrees: not sure what you mean
[16:51:26] <robertmaxrees> are you loading jquery before trying to use that code?
[16:51:30] <laphlaw> i'm able to use jquery to select the element
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.jquery
[16:51:42] <laphlaw> i'm using the safari console
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:52:28] <laphlaw> e.g. this works  --  $( "div.demo-container" )
[16:53:09] <laphlaw> $.fn.jquery gives me an error
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> because jquery is not defined ;)
[16:53:25] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut to querySelectorAll
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> if $ isn't already being used by something else.
[16:53:45] <laphlaw> ok.. how do i define it? again, i'm just testing things out in the Safari developer console
[16:53:51] <robertmaxrees> load it.
[16:54:17] <laphlaw> ..how?
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> include it in the page.
[16:55:29] <laphlaw> interesting...
[16:55:38] <laphlaw> i've never had to load jquery in the console before
[16:55:39] <robertmaxrees> it's not included by default.
[16:55:53] <laphlaw> then how come $( "div.demo-container" )
[16:55:54] <laphlaw> works?
[16:55:59] <robertmaxrees> i just explained that :)
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut to querySelectorAll
[18:58:52] <help_me> Hi everyone
[18:58:59] <help_me> have a tought problem I have been facing
[18:59:05] <help_me> is it okay to paste jfiddle here?
[19:02:05] <MrStubbs> go for it
[19:03:32] <help_me> so I have this
[19:03:32] <help_me> http://jsfiddle.net/mekayx28/
[19:03:39] <help_me> Which works wonderfully
[19:03:49] <help_me> Except it doesn't in my application
[19:04:28] <help_me> the only different
[19:05:09] <help_me> difference between my application and the static page on jsfiddle is that the table on my app is served up dynamically
[19:11:06] <MrStubbs> what is the problem you are observing
[19:13:43] <MrStubbs> also you may want to try ##javascript as well as its more active
[19:27:36] <z1haze> is it possible to autofocus a field on doc ready, and then execute a keypress? because I cant seem to get anything to happen
[19:37:22] <chronos> Hello! I searching for a drag'n'drop plugin and found a lot, including jquery ui draggable/sortable. However I need to build a interface where I will drag a li/td/a/whatever fits better inside a tree, and than update the source and the tree. Thing is, when I finish drag, what plugin allow me to know to where I dragged the object?
[20:00:19] <onr> jquery ui
[21:40:01] <qwertytech> Can anyone help me with my issue.  I can't get my scrolltop  to disappear when I get to my headerSection.  The div's height changes based on the device so I was trying to not use a static number.  https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/j2pLgkxz/
[22:45:35] <tash> is there a way to clear the browser cache in IE programmatically? Some stuff I'm working on works fine in Firefox but not IE ( until I clear the browser cache )
[22:46:16] <Uhkis> i hope not
[22:47:15] <renka> good morning. :)
[22:54:14] <Utils> I'm trying to ste the min-height of a div with the height of another. only problem is it doesnt' quite handle decimals. in a responsive environment where things rely on percentage, rem and em, pxiel decimals are going to happen.
[22:54:15] <tash> sigh, can't get IE to stop freakin' caching
[22:54:36] <Utils> but unfortauntely, due to a border, relying on an integer value instead of a float to set my minHeight can cause issues
[22:54:38] <tash> I have to keep clearing browser cache for some stuff that I don't have to in FF
[22:54:41] <Utils> any idea how to sort?
[22:56:48] <Uhkis> Utils: there's no such thing as pixel decimals
[22:57:36] <Utils> chrome would say otherwise Uhkis ...
[22:57:51] <Utils> also messes up some things as the ywould "round" up or down.
[22:58:04] <Utils> so i end up with what appears to be a 1px gap, all bcause of inconsistencies in decimals.
[22:58:07] <Utils> :(
[22:58:51] <Uhkis> riight, rounding breaks it
[22:59:44] <Utils> http://prntscr.com/83nvd0 prove me wrong.
[23:00:36] <Utils> actual height of #left_column, 358.5px. height returned by $("#left_column").height() is 359px
[23:00:46] <Utils> and i end up with a 1px difference... visually.
[23:01:05] <Utils> subtract 1px, u say? yeah in some profiles, that ends up being 1px too much. :/
[23:02:34] <Utils> http://prntscr.com/83nvxo it would do that if i subtract - 1 from height.
[23:02:40] <Utils> so i can't win
[23:06:32] <undergod> hi there pleople! with node ( http://hastebin.com/dajeqilozo.coffee ) how can i use in client.html <link to css or <script> in other files? RIght now, i have to write everything in the client.html page! thank you
[23:07:13] <Uhkis> undergod: #node.js
[23:07:31] <undergod> oh ye, thank you!
[23:07:59] <Utils> var height = $("#left_column")[0].getBoundingClientRect().height;
[23:08:10] <Utils> not really jquery when you access the ... underlying thing. but that works.
[23:10:31] <Uhkis> Utils: there's also outerHeight()
[23:15:50] <Utils> outerHeight also rounds, i tried tht too.
[23:23:16] <Uhkis> "The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .outerHeight(), may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer"
[23:23:29] <Uhkis> from the api page
