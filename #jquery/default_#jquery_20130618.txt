[00:14:45] <elpidios> hello
[00:15:03] <elpidios> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/ i have this dialog import to my website (see the source code please)
[00:15:12] <elpidios> i want to make cookies for that one but i cant find :9
[00:15:13] <elpidios> :(
[00:19:40] <farmer-duck> Goodmorning!
[00:20:01] <fella5s> did need flag anyway to cover all usecases, is this consired bad practice? .trigger(!e.isTrigger||groupchange?'change':'');
[00:20:20] <farmer-duck> I'm trying to hookup a callback to a jQuery-UI dialog show/hide event, which one should I use?
[00:20:21] <fella5s> old should i do iffing
[00:20:24] <farmer-duck> focus
[00:20:45] <farmer-duck> or open?
[01:22:25] <Krambiorix_> hi, i have to make an application for a customer. I don't want my customer to copy it and use on other computers. Is there any way that i can prevent that?
[01:26:04] <Cork> Krambiorix_: no, and honestly, make the user want to use you instead of forcing them to
[01:26:23] <Cork> s/user/customer/
[01:26:30] <ledinator> joln hello
[01:28:03] <Krambiorix_> Cork, that's not the issue, the issue would be that they copy it for other customers
[01:28:29] <Cork> Krambiorix_: the only thing you can do is obfuscate the code
[01:28:39] <Cork> but no you can't drm it
[01:29:43] <Cork> only thing you can do is have them load the lib from your server and checking that they are "allowed" to do so
[01:29:57] <Cork> but then again, nothing prevents them from saving it and use it either way
[01:30:19] <Krambiorix_> yeah
[01:30:40] <Cork> your best option is to put it in the contract for what they are allowed to do
[01:31:03] <Cork> js is open by nature, so you don't really have much options there
[01:31:28] <Krambiorix_> yeah, i thought so
[01:32:07] <Cork> (and really; the web is open by nature, so you're kinda in the wrong environment if you want to lock things down)
[01:32:26] <Krambiorix_> Cork, true
[01:40:42] <klawd_> hi! is there something like "live" in 2.x?
[01:40:57] <Cork> klawd_: delegate and on
[01:40:59] <klawd_> i'm addin a few elements after an ajax request and want the selector to apply on click
[01:41:02] <Cork> the syntax is different though
[01:41:11] <Cork> so read the documentation
[01:41:12] <Cork> ?.on
[01:41:15] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:43:20] <klawd_> Cork: i looked it over before but i can't find anything on dynamically added elements like with live
[01:43:46] <Cork> klawd_: prob cause you don't know what live did
[01:43:58] <Cork> live bound the event listener on $(document)
[01:44:04] <klawd_> Description: Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future.
[01:44:14] <adman65> Anyone know why jquery is not setting http auth headers when I specify the "username" key for $.ajax?
[01:44:16] <klawd_> _and in the future_
[01:44:21] <Cork> made a search through the dom for the selector, throw away the matches, and use the selector as a filter
[01:45:01] <Cork> klawd_: so if you bind a delegated handler, you get the EXACT same thing if you bind it on $(document), except the useless search through the dom that .live did
[01:45:04] <klawd_> Cork: so how would one handle this now? $(document).on('click', '.selector', function?
[01:45:09] <Cork> yes
[01:45:19] <klawd_> ok, thanks
[01:46:59] <Cork> adman65: you mean through setRequestHeader?
[01:47:20] <adman65> Cork: no, by specifying the "username" or "password" keys
[01:47:58] <Nephro> If I replace a block of a page using an AJAX request to the server, will the document.ready event be triggered up completion of the request and redrawing of the newly received part?
[01:48:14] <Nephro> s/up/upon
[01:49:59] <Cork> adman65: i don't think that works for basic auth
[01:50:24] <adman65> Cork: it should according to the documentation :(
[01:50:39] <Cork> adman65: authenticate, ya, doens't say it for basic auth
[01:50:53] <Cork> adman65: basic auth expects the user and password to be encoded
[01:50:57] <Cork> and i don't think it does that
[01:51:02] <adman65> oh right
[01:51:18] <Cork> though i'm only guessing, haven't used it that way
[01:52:43] <sharpy> hey guys, i am jusing the Raphael Javascript Library to display SVG grafik in IE 8 & 7 and the other browsers the thing is, that i am getting an error in jquery: SCRIPT 87: Invalid Argument, Jquery.js line 8 character 89949
[01:53:07] <sharpy> does anybody had the same error before?  in front, i cannot make a working jsfiddle. sorry..
[01:54:18] <Mr_King> Does anyone have any experience with bootstrap modals?
[01:54:18] <sharpy> http://paste.schredder.me/1419/15456511/
[01:54:30] <sharpy> the line number 3 is the line where the error encounters.
[01:56:45] <Cork> sharpy: use an uncompressed version of jquery
[01:57:10] <sharpy> why ? should that help to fix the bug?
[01:57:14] <Cork> and put a break point there and backtrace out into raphael or you're code
[01:57:27] <JBlitzen> I don't believe so, Nephro, but the ajax callback will get hit.  And jquery ajax also supports a "target" or something option indicating what element's content to overwrite with the response.  But use the callback if you have to do processing on the response output.
[01:57:28] <Cork> sharpy: cause the bug is to 99%+ in you're code or raphael
[01:58:00] <Cork> sharpy: and yes, it much easier to know what the code does if you have the variable names
[01:58:39] <sharpy> okay thanks Cork i will download the uncompressed jquery version
[01:59:06] <Cork> Nephro: and yes, like jBlitzen said, ready is only triggered on the initial full page load
[01:59:15] <Cork> Nephro: ajax doens't trigger any events at all
[01:59:25] <sharpy> Cork: this one right?
[01:59:25] <sharpy> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.js
[01:59:29] <Cork> except for the *Ajax events
[01:59:36] <Cork> sharpy: ya
[02:00:00] <Cork> sharpy: though that is just a generic tip, never develop with the minified version of jquery
[02:02:39] <sharpy> ok :) thanks for that tip :)
[02:02:43] <sharpy> will keep that in mind
[02:03:03] <Cork> but for you're problem you need to backtrace out of the jquery lib
[02:03:21] <Cork> cause the problem is almost guaranteed outside of jquery
[02:09:00] <adman65> Cork: you were right. You have to encode it yourself.
[02:09:17] <sharpy> Cork. now have implemented the uncompressed same version of jquery
[02:09:21] <sharpy> its jwuery 1.8.3
[02:10:27] <Cork> ok, then put a break point where it breaks, and then either check the tracktrace (if the debugger supports it) or code step back out from where you are until you hit your code
[02:10:52] <grocker> hello
[02:11:01] <grocker> i need help with somehting
[02:11:02] <Cork> adman65: ya, i had a vague memory of that
[02:11:08] <sharpy> this is code cork: the error encounters on line 23
[02:11:09] <sharpy> http://paste.schredder.me/1420/13715466/
[02:11:22] <adman65> Cork: when I finally got the auth header right, it told me to change the authorization scheme. Was like...lol.
[02:11:26] <Cork> adman65: tried using basic auth a few years back but through it out cause it works so badly in browsers
[02:11:35] <adman65> silly stripe
[02:12:03] <Cork> adman65: the fact that most browser can't log you out from a basic auth session makes... yuck...
[02:12:09] <grocker> i need help with something, i think i'm in the right channel, i'm new at this and i'm learning by myself
[02:12:34] <grocker> im doing a web page and it has jquery and javascript
[02:12:43] <Cork> sharpy: wait, this looks the same?
[02:12:48] <Cork> sharpy: what lib is this?
[02:14:44] <sharpy> cork: this is weird
[02:15:02] <sharpy> i toook uncompressed development version
[02:15:07] <sharpy> of jquery 1.8.3
[02:15:22] <Cork> sharpy: what file is this in?
[02:16:43] <sharpy> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js
[02:16:47] <sharpy> just copy and pasted it
[02:17:06] <Cork> sharpy: no i meant in the error message from the browser
[02:17:26] <Cork> it says what file is had the exception
[02:17:36] <Cork> *resource
[02:18:06] <sharpy> it is the file where i put my jquery in
[02:18:25] <sharpy> i have a file where i got 3 libraries in it to reduce the number of HTTP requests
[02:18:33] <Cork> sharpy: clear your cache then
[02:18:39] <sharpy> but there is just this jquery, jquery cookie, and raphael in it
[02:18:44] <sharpy> i already cleared it
[02:19:01] <sharpy> with ctrl + F5 and development control, cache => clear cache
[02:19:09] <sharpy> no effect
[02:19:17] <Cork> and you're sure the line you coped is from the jquery section?
[02:19:36] <Cork> i don't recognize it so i don't think it is
[02:19:42] <sharpy> i am sure ;) just checked it
[02:20:54] <Cork> position="absolute" does not exist in jquery
[02:20:56] <Cork> so no
[02:21:01] <Cork> that code is something else
[02:22:11] <Cork> sharpy: it's raphaël thats crashing
[02:22:37] <Cork> so again https://raw.github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/master/raphael.js
[02:23:09] <sharpy> i realised that
[02:23:27] <sharpy> because everything works fine on browsers with svg support
[02:23:40] <sharpy> just where vml is used its crashing so in ie 7 and ie 8
[02:24:00] <sharpy> sorry i didnt mentioned that earlier
[02:24:20] <Cork> it should use vml for ie, and that SHOULD work just fine
[02:24:30] <Cork> (it does for me at least)
[02:28:17] <sharpy> i know, i am checking it out :) thanks for help cork :)
[02:30:18] <sharpy> the good thing about raphael was that you could display svg no matter if the browser supports it or not , if it does not it uses vml
[02:31:31] <Cork> sharpy: well there is limitations
[02:31:49] <Cork> the biggest one is that it has to be generated from javascript
[02:31:52] <Cork> you can't use files
[02:32:17] <sharpy> i am doing this, i was converting my svg with readysetraphael to javascript
[02:32:55] <sharpy> but i think its better solution for event binding and so on
[02:34:02] <Cork> sharpy: well with some luck it won't be needed in 10 months :)
[02:34:20] <Cork> then you can just use svg and it will work
[02:34:23] <grafi> knock on wood
[02:34:33] <sharpy> i need event binding
[02:34:40] <Cork> sharpy: ya?
[02:34:42] <sharpy> :P i am already using it and it works just fnid
[02:34:47] <sharpy> *fine on the other browsers
[02:34:50] <sharpy> yes i do
[02:34:51] <Cork> sharpy: it's dom, so you can bind events just fine without a lib
[02:35:13] <Cork> sharpy: my point is that ie < 9 most will die in 10 months
[02:35:19] <Cork> -most
[02:35:35] <sharpy> why should it?
[02:35:46] <Cork> cause windows xp hits eol
[02:36:04] <Cork> and there is no point for vista or 7 users to use ie7 or 8
[02:36:05] <sharpy> ah okay
[02:36:20] <Cork> xp has no choice
[02:36:23] <sharpy> but what about users that actually work with elder browsers like 7 and 8
[02:36:45] <Cork> sharpy: they most likely work with it cause of those users :)
[02:37:15] <Cork> sharpy: and ya, ie 8 exists for later i think, i don't think 7 ever was on them
[02:37:55] <Cork> for me at lest i will stop caring about ie pre 9 after xp dies
[02:38:16] <Cork> it's there problem if they went out of there way to use an old browser
[02:39:12] <sharpy> yeah sure in private development i am doing that too :)
[02:39:23] <sharpy> so now i got uncompressed code
[02:39:34] <sharpy> as you've said its raphael that is breaking
[02:39:39] <Cork> and include the error message you get
[02:41:12] <sharpy> http://paste.schredder.me/1422/13715484/
[02:41:33] <sharpy> on line 31 it breaks
[02:42:03] <sharpy> on line 48 is the error message
[02:48:05] <sharpy> Cork: in development console of IE , if i am using BrowserMode IE7 and DocumentMode IE9 it works fine
[02:48:12] <sharpy> but with DocumentMode IE7 it does not
[02:50:40] <juria_roberts> How do i change the value of an element and force its change event to trigger?
[02:52:02] <sharpy> $("element").val()
[02:52:08] <sharpy> juria_roberts
[02:52:31] <juria_roberts> sharpy: that doesnt make the elements change event trigger
[02:53:13] <sharpy> you can use the trigger function juria_roberts
[02:53:13] <sharpy> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[02:53:30] <sharpy> than you can trigger it by yourself if you change the value
[02:53:41] <DjMadness> Hi guys, i am trying to make some anchor based navigation, to get an ajax request to a specific page f.ex news.php when the url is ie http://example.net/#news Does anyone know of a plugin to handle this, or maybe know of a good solution to handle this without too much hassle ?
[02:54:38] <DjMadness> most google replies are more for scrolling down a page, but that is not what i am looking for. Maybe i am searching for the wrong name for what i am doing
[02:54:55] <juria_roberts> sharpy: im setting a value to the element like this $("element").val("dsa") how do i trigger that?
[02:55:12] <sharpy> i guess just with
[02:55:34] <sharpy> $("element").val("dsa").trigger("change"); (i am not sure about the name
[03:02:12] <sharpy> Cork: do you have any solution for me?
[03:02:54] <Cork> sharpy: not without the error message
[03:03:33] <sharpy> i posted the error message in the skript
[03:03:35] <sharpy> i was sending
[03:03:46] <sharpy> this is all the error information i am getting
[03:05:01] <Cork> sharpy: so R._g.doc.createElement("div") fails with invalid argument?!?
[03:05:47] <sharpy> yes
[03:06:07] <Cork> no clue what would cause that
[03:06:18] <sharpy> damnit
[03:06:19] <sharpy> :(
[03:06:31] <sharpy> i have no idea why this occurs
[03:06:35] <sharpy> everything worked fine befor
[03:06:36] <sharpy> e
[03:07:47] <Cork> sharpy: googled around a bit and it looks like it might be that the document in R refers to another document
[03:08:12] <juria_roberts> sharpy: that didnt work
[03:08:39] <juria_roberts> sharpy: the change event is defined like this $('.color-picker').miniColors({
[03:08:40] <juria_roberts> 			change: function(hex, rgb) {
[03:08:58] <Cork> juria_roberts: that's not an event it's a callback
[03:09:12] <Cork> and it's not sure you can trigger it externally at all
[03:09:21] <sharpy> Cork: what could cause the reference to another document?
[03:09:37] <Cork> sharpy: an iframe? i donno
[03:09:48] <juria_roberts> Cork: there must be some way of triggering it
[03:09:52] <Cork> sharpy: i can only give you hints to work in; i don't have the code so i can't do much
[03:10:06] <Cork> juria_roberts: save the function in a variable and call it
[03:10:25] <Cork> var change = function() {}; $('.color-picker').miniColors({ change: change });
[03:10:48] <Cork> other then that you would have to look into the plugin for miniColors
[03:12:13] <sharpy> ok thanks cork :)
[03:12:21] <sharpy> but theres no i frame i am using
[03:15:27] <sharpy> when i console.log(R) i just get the message, that it mybrowser dioes not support svg and that it is falling down to vml
[03:15:45] <juria_roberts> Cork: can you make out how to call change event from here http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-miniColors/
[03:15:56] <juria_roberts> Cork: i couldnt figure it out
[03:24:37] <sharpy> i can i do something like that programmatically: if browser is msie and version is below 9 swith to documentmode 9?
[03:24:47] <soee> if i have form with multiple fields etc, can i send using ajax only some selected ?
[03:24:50] <sharpy> what problems could cause i i can do something like that
[03:50:45] <soee> does the change event works similiar for inputs, select, checkboxes ?
[03:51:01] <Cork> no
[03:51:25] <Cork> change triggers on blur for inputs for example
[03:51:42] <Cork> and i don't think it triggers at all on checkboxes
[03:51:50] <Cork> but i might be wrong there
[04:09:36] <mydog2> morn.. if i have multiple jquery files, but i want to have the same "vars" in the file.. would the approach be to create a var.js, declare the vars to be "var foo;" and the use the get_script() in each jquery file to include the master var file?
[04:16:20] <sammich> get_script?
[04:20:19] <mydog2> sammich,  getScript
[04:20:35] <KebabBob> I'm writing a simple chrome extensions (using jquery) and I'm making a few $.ajax() requests in the extensions.. The request don't show up in the network tab tho.. Any idea where I can monitor them?
[04:21:02] <sammich> ah, I've not used that before. Well, as long as you only reference them after they're available
[04:24:28] <sammich> oops, that wasn't a chrome extension. at least my XHR requests show with userscripts
[04:26:09] <KebabBob> console.log() doesn't seem to work either
[04:27:23] <sammich> KebabBob: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3829150/google-chrome-extension-console-log-from-background-page
[04:27:49] <shahin8r> http://pastebin.com/8Zv3C2M6Â <- anyone know why this simple jquery snippet doesnt work?
[04:29:34] <sammich> shahin8r: http://jsfiddle.net/RCQqG/
[04:39:51] <sharpy> hey Cork: i now just figured out which line exactly caused the breaking of the svg: its simply the first line: rsr = Raphael('paper',140, 650, 800, 0);
[04:39:59] <sharpy> what could cause the problem here?
[04:40:22] <Cork> sharpy: most likley someting in the init function
[04:40:28] <Cork> so no i don't think it is that line
[04:41:12] <sharpy> what i did was testing where the error occurs in my script
[04:41:37] <sharpy> i just put a console.log("test") and figured out that after this line the skript breaks
[04:41:40] <sharpy> i mean at this line
[04:41:47] <Cork> sharpy: ya, so it most likely is a problem in raphael
[04:41:51] <sharpy> nothing else is running through the js interpreter
[04:42:12] <Cork> might be a missing dependency, or a pure bug in the lib
[04:42:14] <sharpy> it is so need to figure it out why :)
[04:42:27] <Cork> ya
[04:42:32] <sharpy> because the raphael constructor call, calls the .Create method
[04:42:54] <sharpy> and in the create element when it comes to positioning it with top and left properties the skript breaks
[04:43:13] <sharpy> so i guess i am just setting wrong params
[04:44:58] <Cork> sharpy: ya, that is possiblwe
[04:45:05] <Cork> *possible
[04:45:18] <sharpy> i am just reading the docs currently
[04:45:22] <sharpy> maybe i missed something
[04:45:22] <Cork> one min let me check what i use to call parhael with; was a while since i used it last
[04:45:37] <sharpy> ill keep you informed when i solved the prob
[04:45:52] <sharpy> *hopefully today, this is what keeps me from finishing the project today xD
[04:46:05] <Cork> sharpy: are you sure Raphael takes a string for the target?
[04:46:25] <sharpy> not really, this is what i was getting from ready set raphael
[04:46:50] <sharpy> try converting an existing svg into javascript and it will output construct like that
[04:47:17] <Cork> sharpy: try rsr = Raphael(140, 650, 800, 0);
[04:48:01] <sharpy> damn cork
[04:48:07] <sharpy> i love ya, you are a genius
[04:48:07] <Cork> and then possibly rsr.paper
[04:48:12] <sharpy> fixed it!!!!
[04:48:37] <sharpy> took me 6 hours to fix this :) thanks for help for the day :)
[04:48:39] <Cork> not sure where you got that 'paper' from
[04:48:50] <sharpy> it was from the readysetraphael
[04:48:57] <Cork> ah
[04:51:42] <sharpy> so fyi the readysetraphael page is not a converter that does everything 100% correct :D
[04:52:34] <Cork> ya, doesn't surprise me
[04:53:08] <sharpy> i am glad this is done
[04:53:13] <sharpy> thank you so much :)
[04:53:26] <sharpy> you see, i was scratching my head for this
[05:12:27] <sharpy> Cork: one last question :) when i have a div that has multiple shapes with a class rvml in it (svg in vml converted) how would i select the div?
[05:12:44] <sharpy> i am just trying it with $(".rvml").parent()
[05:12:49] <sharpy> which doesnt work
[05:13:17] <Cork> why do you need to select the div from the content?
[05:13:21] <Cork> just give it a class or id
[05:13:35] <sharpy> thats exactly what i want to do
[05:13:45] <sharpy> i want to give it a class
[05:14:21] <Cork> sharpy: why don't you give it a class before you run raphael on it?
[05:15:08] <sharpy> ah damn i am totally sorry, i am already doing this and the class is set to the element
[05:15:19] <sharpy> but it has no affect so but thanks :p
[05:19:08] <gregtom6> hy all
[05:19:48] <gregtom6> I post an example site for you. I would like to ask about why jquery doesn't work?
[05:20:47] <sharpy> Cork: how do i select the shapes with jquery?
[05:20:57] <gregtom6> where can I paste jquery code?
[05:21:05] <gregtom6> I see now
[05:21:09] <Cork> ?p @ gregtom6
[05:21:10] <bot-t> gregtom6, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:21:22] <Cork> sharpy: by element or class or id, just like any dom element
[05:21:44] <sammich> where can I get a list of these bot commands?
[05:21:54] <sharpy> thanks Cork :)
[05:21:57] <Cork> ?commands
[05:21:58] <bot-t> http://bot-t.com/docs/
[05:22:33] <sammich> that link doesn't work
[05:23:04] <Cork> eh, then you can't
[05:23:10] <sammich> wooo
[05:24:19] <gregtom6> http://jsbin.com/egixac
[05:24:28] <gregtom6> why this doesn't work?
[05:25:39] <Cork> please remove css and javascript not related to the question
[05:25:48] <Cork> and put the javascript in the javascript column
[05:26:12] <Cork> also define "doesn't work"
[05:26:22] <sammich> put me in the basket that doesn't like jsbin
[05:26:54] <Cork> jsbin is actually ok now days, though i like the really old jsbin better
[05:27:25] <sammich> I feel like I need that 1440p screen I ordered to use that
[05:27:30] <sammich> site*
[05:27:45] <soee> when using delegate can i assign click function to several elements ?
[05:27:46] <Cork> you can hide columns
[05:27:50] <soee> *event
[05:27:59] <gregtom6> "doesn't work" means nothing I don't get even the alert messages
[05:28:02] <Cork> soee: that is the point of it ya
[05:28:16] <soee> Cork, ok thank you
[05:29:13] <Cork> gregtom6: uh alert isn't a jquery function
[05:29:43] <gregtom6> well, that doesn't run too
[05:30:25] <soee> if i have function than should have default value for some arguments is this proper way to do it: if(typeof(foo)==='undefined') foo= 'bar;  - inside that function ?
[05:30:47] <Cork> gregtom6: also you have put the code and the loading of jquery in the same script tag
[05:31:12] <Cork> gregtom6: http://jsbin.com/egixac/3/edit
[05:31:22] <sammich> in that regard, tutorial sites generally seem to refer to alert and setTimeout/Interval under the window object. I would think it's pretty safe to assume no one is going to overload(?) those names, no?
[05:32:11] <Cork> ?eval var echo = function(s) { s = s || 'hello'; print(s); }; s(); @ soee
[05:32:14] <bot-t> soee: ReferenceError: s is not defined
[05:32:20] <Cork> uh
[05:32:35] <Cork> opps
[05:32:36] <Cork> ?eval var echo = function(s) { s = s || 'hello'; print(s); }; echo(); @ soee
[05:32:37] <bot-t> soee: "hello"
[05:32:48] <Cork> ?eval var echo = function(s) { s = s || 'hello'; print(s); }; echo('no default'); @ soee
[05:32:49] <bot-t> soee: "no default"
[05:33:11] <gregtom6> Cork: that's already in the same tag
[05:33:20] <gregtom6> alert doesn't work for me
[05:33:27] <Cork> gregtom6: ya, that was one of the problems
[05:33:40] <Cork> you can't both load an external script AND run inline scripts in the same tag
[05:33:45] <Cork> put them into separate tags
[05:33:48] <sammich> what does that bot do for inf loops?
[05:34:00] <Cork> sammich: times out
[05:34:06] <sammich> clefar
[05:34:19] <Cork> though there has been js bots that doesn't :D
[05:34:48] <sammich> totally not surprised :)
[05:34:54] <Cork> setInterval(function() { print('hello'); }, 300); becomes kinda annoying on those
[05:35:54] <sammich> which bot is on this chan?
[05:36:10] <Cork> js bots is bot-t and b-ot
[05:36:22] <Cork> i think there is a few others, but not sure about there name
[05:36:32] <gregtom6> Cork: it works in separate tags, but I would like to test the jquery, so it would be the best if that would work in that tags too
[05:36:51] <Cork> gregtom6: what makes you think they don't?
[05:38:10] <gregtom6> Cork: well, you said I should put the alert() into another script tags. So I think the alert will work only first time, but in jquery functions it won't. Will them work?
[05:38:57] <Cork> uh
[05:39:13] <Cork> gregtom6: the first tag you had there should be to load the jquery library
[05:39:21] <Cork> that should be the only thing you use that tag for
[05:39:38] <Cork> if you want to run more code, jquery or not, but that into a separate tag
[05:39:51] <sammich> if you have something inside the 'src' attribute, nothing (nothing) goes inside the actual script tag
[05:40:11] <gregtom6> so there should be a script tag only with loading the library and nothing else? and the other should consist of alerts, jquery functions, etc?
[05:40:27] <sammich> mm hmm
[05:40:34] <gregtom6> okay
[05:40:36] <Cork> gregtom6: like i said, you can't mix external and inline scripts in the same tag
[05:41:00] <Cork> for js what script tag it comes from doesn't matter
[05:41:08] <pikapika> Hey there, I am making a Timesheet web app, I got stuck trying to figure the implementation of the approval system. So an employee submits hours for approval, the manager can approve or not in which case employee enters it again. after approval the particular day's text entry box gets disabled.
[05:41:24] <Cork> gregtom6: js only cares about scope, and script tags doens't affect that
[05:41:26] <pikapika> I am thinking of making an intermediate log table with the same structure as that of the final one, that maps hours, employees and projects. Display checkboxes next to each for the manager as or no. Any better method?
[05:41:27] <gregtom6> Cork: okay, I asked that question before I scrolled down, since the webchat doesn't have autoscroll now.
[05:42:37] <sammich> Cork: you'd think there would be a list somewhere available to see all setIntervals running. window.timers[id]
[05:42:47] <sammich> sorry, that goes back a few minutes
[05:43:06] <Cork> sammich: there is loads of things you would expect when it comes to those old functions
[05:43:46] <Cork> but ya, a list of all timers in the page (and all event listeners) would be nice
[05:45:48] <Whirl3d> Could you use php to parse javascripts so that you could replace functions with jquery-modified functions? In other words, ever setInterval replace with customSetInterval to register a timer?
[05:51:43] <sammich> hell, you could probably just override window.setIntercal
[05:52:33] <pikapika> Hello
[05:53:35] <Whirl3d> pikapika, sounds good but can the supervisor change hours?
[05:54:12] <sammich> the signature would just be the same, the body would push the timer id to a window.timers[]
[05:54:49] <Whirl3d> pikapika, if not, make the entire line entry the toggle for approval, otherwise, if a change is made, the change has to be approved by employee
[05:56:31] <pikapika> Whirl3d: I am new to jquery, can you point me in the right direction for this?
[05:57:14] <Whirl3d> Actually, that's more of a style suggestion. Not really jquery related.
[05:57:52] <Whirl3d> If you post your code to jsfiddle.net, I could show you what I mean by targeting the row for toggle.
[05:59:11] <pikapika> Havent started doing it yet :P maybe in an hour I can
[06:05:24] <Bloomberg> Hello guys!!
[06:05:28] <Bloomberg> I have a problem
[06:07:03] <sammich> Anything for a Mayor
[06:08:07] <Bloomberg> sammich: Hi
[06:08:32] <Musk> Bloomberg not you :o
[06:08:45] <Musk> >.<
[06:12:34] <Bloomberg_> http://jsfiddle.net/z2dUT/
[06:13:21] <Bloomberg_> That is my problem
[06:14:08] <Bloomberg_> Is like delayed, I onclick one item and show me information of before onclick element and so on
[06:14:30] <robert_> so, how does one select an element if the only thing you know is that it has a data attribute?
[06:15:07] <Whirl3d> Bloomberg, works for me.
[06:15:28] <Whirl3d> Bloomberg, use console.log instead of alert
[06:15:30] <Bloomberg_> I need if I select one alert('one');
[06:16:26] <Whirl3d> Bloomberg, then you should put 'one' in data-info or change your value declaration
[06:17:54] <Whirl3d> If you want the number '0' for the first element, 1 for the second and so on, you could use value:$(this).parent().index()
[06:19:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/z2dUT/2/
[06:20:11] <Whirl3d> if you want the literal string 'one' for 0....etc.
[06:23:23] <samsoft> hello house
[06:23:40] <JimmyXander> Hello
[06:23:43] <Arko455> Hi
[06:23:48] <samsoft> Please i need a snippet to bookmark and make a site homepage
[06:24:34] <Whirl3d> samsoft, did you try the google fairy??
[06:24:38] <Arko455> http://www.abestweb.com/forums/programming-datafeeds-tools-188/bookmark-site-make-homepage-html-javascript-firefox-70049.html
[06:24:46] <Arko455> That one seems legit, and I'm sure you didn't use Google indeed.
[06:25:02] <wallunit> I wonder if there is any reason to use jQuery instead of the plain built-in (DOM) API, if you don't have to care about compatibility with older and non-standart browsers?
[06:25:52] <samsoft> Thanks Arko455: trying to use google but what i'm seen is not okay
[06:26:38] <Whirl3d> wallunit, depends on what you are doing. A text-only webpage with no formatting, use html only. Anything fancy or nice, use css. Anything worthwhile, use jquery...
[06:27:13] <Whirl3d> don't use it if you don't need it. There are lots of uses for jquery besides cross-browser compat
[06:27:43] <samsoft> Whirl3d
[06:29:00] <Whirl3d> samsoft, Trust me I know. I ask here all the time after googling...I find tha tit helps to preface your request with "anybody have a preference for ....." to see if I can get opinions rather than google results
[06:30:03] <samsoft> Whirl3d, trying to check the one Arko455 send to me.. but still not satisfy... can u suggest anyone for me
[06:30:54] <Whirl3d> I wish I could. Unfortunately, I have never had the need for such a thing. Sorry I couldn't be of more help
[06:32:03] <samsoft> Thanks Whirl3d, check out this site... www.careervacancy.com/demo
[06:35:58] <wesleyh_> why does $.getJSON(...).fail(function() { console.log('fail') }); work correctly to output a msg when an external json file fails to load, but this doesn't work with $.ajax({url: '..', dataType: 'jsonp', ... }).fail(function() { console.log('fail'); }); ?
[06:39:45] <samsoft> Whirl3d: need to fix the side bar when the page scrol and follow the page to scroll
[06:40:11] <JimmyXander> Was that english dude?
[06:41:12] <wesleyh_> you can see it here: http://jsfiddle.net/8C7Hb/ -- getjson indicates an error, but the same with .ajax does not. any ideas why?
[06:44:37] <wallunit> Whirl3d: That's the website I'm working on: http://cocktails.djacap.net/. It doesn't has the most fancy layout. But I use a lot of JS features (DOM events, DOM manipulation, AJAX, history API, infinte scroll, media queries, etc.) When I have started I have used jQuery whereever possible. But I just noted that I could probably do all of this for modern browsers with the same amount of plain JS just using the browser's API.
[06:45:42] <JimmyXander> You could do a lot to make that look better with only a small bit of css dude
[06:48:09] <gregtom6> how should I detect if browser window is in full screen/get the resolution of the opsys?
[06:48:09] <wallunit> JimmyXander: In case you are talking to me, I kept the UI simple by intenention.
[06:48:55] <emwat> I want to add a div inside another div.  Shouldn't it be $("div").add("div");
[06:49:13] <JimmyXander> I wants saying to complicate it. I love minimalism. I'm just saying a few lines of css could make it gorgeous. A nicer font, better color and heirarchy.
[06:52:18] <Bloomberg_> http://jsfiddle.net/KLEvQ/
[06:52:58] <Bloomberg_> Always n the onclick event send the same value, the first
[06:53:46] <wallunit> JimmyXander: Acutally I like the font. Note it isn't any standart font, but an external webfont.
[06:54:26] <wallunit> JimmyXander: However, may I ask which browser/version you are using, that to make sure that it isrendered correctly?
[06:54:28] <JimmyXander> It's soso
[06:54:35] <JimmyXander> No offense meant
[06:54:44] <JimmyXander> I get snobby, I'm a designer. Sorry
[06:55:02] <jax> when does something have to go in document.ready?
[06:55:08] <Bloomberg_> works like this:: in the left side in my page  i have a list of options (like a menu), where I can select the type of contact that I should to see in the table, works perfect. but just the first time
[06:55:28] <sammich> Open Sans, +1
[06:55:51] <sammich> jax: when you want it run as soon as the page loads
[06:55:52] <Bloomberg_> so, if the first time I select something works perfect but then If I select another thing it does create like a loop
[06:55:54] <yedimind> i use open sans for ERRYTHING
[06:56:02] <Bloomberg_> and always is the first option selected
[06:56:07] <wallunit> JimmyXander: You might want to check out how the layout scales, when you change the width of your browser window.
[06:56:38] <wallunit> And again, with which browser and version you are looking at my website?
[06:56:47] <JimmyXander> Safari 6
[06:57:11] <sammich> that font looks like, something between Optima and Verdana (?)
[06:57:51] <sammich> okay I'm clearly not a font person
[06:58:32] <JimmyXander> Your very wrong sammich. Sorry
[06:58:37] <JimmyXander> ={
[06:58:45] <sammich> yeah, verdana is absolutely the wrong choice there
[06:58:52] <sammich> I can't pick out the name
[06:59:09] <wallunit> JimmyXander: That explains your expirience with the website. I'm using flexbox (the new draft: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes), which isn't supported yet by Safari and MSIE.
[06:59:27] <sammich> Helvetica Neue Ultralight is coming into fashion, pplz
[07:00:11] <JimmyXander> The website looks just fine
[07:00:21] <JimmyXander> It's just the details that are lacking
[07:01:06] <JimmyXander> I would suggest something clean to compliment the design. Something like Proxima Nova, Source Sans Pro or Lucida Grande Light
[07:01:30] <JimmyXander> These are crisp, well spaced and cleanly designed fonts.
[07:02:10] <sammich> two things are completely beyond my grasp as a web dev: colours and fonts
[07:02:21] <sammich> can't pick either to save my life
[07:02:28] <JimmyXander> That's okay sammich. You'll always have me to fall back on.
[07:02:31] <gordian> that's a job for designers
[07:02:39] <JimmyXander> Which I am
[07:02:39] <gordian> know your strengths
[07:02:45] <sammich> what happens if I'm the best guy for the job at my place :|
[07:02:52] <gordian> i envy people who can do design and dev
[07:03:04] <JimmyXander> Your place needs to hit a job fair then
[07:03:07] <JimmyXander> =P
[07:03:11] <gordian> sammich: then it sounds like you need to hire a designer
[07:03:20] <gordian> at least on a freelance basis
[07:03:26] <gordian> nothing wrong with that
[07:03:34] <gordian> division of labor makes the world go 'round
[07:03:35] <sammich> we don't need one. I'm probably more than enough since it's a small shop
[07:03:48] <sammich> I'll just stick to the tried and true stuff
[07:03:53] <gordian> size matters not
[07:03:55] <sammich> steal stuff from bootstrap
[07:03:55] <JimmyXander> You under estimate the true value of good design
[07:04:04] <gordian> judge me by my size do you?
[07:04:31] <sammich> I don't. But I assure you, they won't hire a designer full time in-house
[07:05:24] <sammich> I fully appreciate good design. I am a minimalist guy where I can be. I do dig up how a nice site does it's layout. But I cannot make a good design from scratch. That's all.
[07:05:25] <JimmyXander> I'm in the same boat. I'm the only person here besides the boss and project manager, they won't hire me a developer
[07:05:34] <sammich> when I say good, I mean astounding.
[07:05:38] <JimmyXander> so I have to make do with figuring out how to code things myself.
[07:05:45] <JimmyXander> This channel has been very helpful to me
[07:05:49] <JimmyXander> =D
[07:05:59] <sammich> I joined here about 5 days ago
[07:06:06] <sammich> figure I may hang around
[07:06:52] <wallunit> JimmyXander: Just to make sure, since I have never tested it in Safari, this is how it is supposed to look like (and scale dependent on the available width): http://imgur.com/a/UFgwG
[07:07:30] <JimmyXander> No It Doesn't look exactly like that
[07:07:43] <JimmyXander> That picture IS a bit better
[07:07:56] <sammich> in chrome, that looks exactly what mine did
[07:08:36] <sammich> safari doesn't have the source selector on the right
[07:08:41] <JimmyXander> it doesn't look like that in firefox for me either
[07:09:47] <wallunit> JimmyXander: It does if you enable flexbox in firefox ( change the about:config preference "layout.css.flexbox.enabled" to true) or if you upgrade to Firefox 22 (beta).
[07:10:02] <JimmyXander> bah no thanks
[07:10:53] <wallunit> However at latest when Firefox 22 is released it will be rendered correctly for firefox users.
[07:11:05] <JimmyXander> I'll wait
[07:11:24] <wallunit> And in Chrome (Desktop and Mobile) it is already right.
[07:12:10] <wallunit>  But it might need some years until Safari and MSIE will implement the new CSS draft for flexible box layouts.
[07:12:33] <sammich> what about all the poor folks on older browsers?
[07:13:02] <wallunit> sammich: Is there any reason to use ancient browsers?
[07:13:26] <wallunit> Or is there any reason for me to support them? ;)
[07:13:44] <sammich> what, firefox 21 is too old? :
[07:13:45] <sammich> :p
[07:14:14] <wallunit> Actually not, you just have to enable flexbox manually in about:config
[07:14:37] <wallunit> However it will be on by default from Firefox 22+.
[07:14:43] <jax> if i have something like <li data-target="#other_element"> how do i get the jquery object for that with $(this) if $(this) is the li?
[07:14:52] <__machine> why does my queue function never get called? $('#someid').queue(function(next) { console.log('xyz'); next(); }); ?
[07:16:45] <sammich> jax: var targ = $(this).attr('data-target'); $(target)....
[07:16:54] <sammich> oops $(targ)
[07:17:41] <jax> perfect, or even .data() i see
[07:18:44] <sammich> yeah, I tended to store that stuff in the markup
[07:18:56] <sammich> actually tag attr
[07:33:29] <yousaf> has anyone come across any plugins that can demonstrate responsive design?
[07:33:49] <yousaf> Looking for something that you can drag/resize to demonstrate what responsive design is on a webpage
[07:35:16] <klawd_> yousaf: http://www.fusion-festival.de/ this site responds to dimension changes
[07:35:56] <yousaf> klawd_ thank you but i am looking for a plugin that i could use within a webpage to simulate responsive design
[07:36:18] <klawd_> yousaf: then sorry, can't help you
[07:36:41] <yedimind> yousaf did you google at all ?
[07:36:46] <yousaf> i did
[07:36:55] <yousaf> but can't find anything i am afraid
[07:36:57] <yedimind> there's a plugin called 'responsive inspector' for chrome
[07:37:01] <yedimind> there are also 230598 sites that do it for you
[07:37:04] <yedimind> what did you search for exactly?
[07:37:21] <yedimind> http://screenqueri.es/
[07:37:27] <yedimind> http://mattkersley.com/responsive/
[07:37:34] <yousaf> yedimind i know of the plugins for browsers but I want to create a landing page and within that landing page i want to have a emulator
[07:37:35] <yedimind> http://responsive.victorcoulon.fr/
[07:37:40] <yousaf> so that my clients could play with it
[07:37:46] <yedimind> http://responsive.is/
[07:38:02] <yedimind> the one one mattkersley.com is on github
[07:38:04] <yedimind> you can grab it
[07:39:09] <yousaf> thank you :)
[07:39:28] <wallunit> yousaf: I don't know what a plugin like that is supposed to do. You have to write your media queries and change the css rules depndent on the available width to make a responsive design.
[07:39:47] <yedimind> wallunit he just need a simple way to show what he's done to his clients
[07:41:06] <yousaf> basically a better more elegant version of this http://jamus.co.uk/demos/rwd-demonstrations/
[07:41:25] <__machine> i have some code that iterates through an array of coordinates and then creates a new element, inserts it to the dom and positions it at the coordinates... but none of the new elements appear on page until the whole loop is finished... how can i get them to display one at a time as it goes?
[07:48:59] <shoky> __machine: uhmm how long does it take the loop to finish..?
[07:50:03] <maxmoore14> anyone know if jquery 2.x has a fix for this problem --> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11461
[07:50:04] <shoky> to display one at a time you'd need to setTimeout each iteration (or delay in some way) which would make everything take even longer
[07:52:32] <shoky> maxmoore14: i don't see why it would. jquery 2.x is same as pre-2.x  except for oldIE support
[07:53:17] <maxmoore14> shoky: yeah, I guess you're right
[07:59:22] <yousaf> yedimind guess what I found!
[08:01:08] <jax> if i define a var outside of the document.ready scope, will it be available to everything?
[08:01:14] <yousaf> any freelancers?
[08:14:37] <karbassi> jax: if you define a var outside of any scope (in the global scope), it will be available within other scopes.

[08:32:56] <groundee> systemfault:  i did the best i can i guess
[08:33:23] <karbassi> gregtom6: I world suggest using console rather than alert.
[08:33:24] <systemfault> Do you want to read json or html?
[08:33:36] <ak5> hi, how can I find this HTML element: <font size="-1" color="#008000">zhidao.baidu.com/question/3360236...&nbsp;&nbsp;2011-11-15</font> ? -OR- is there a way to look for elements based on the color they are rendered as?
[08:35:00] <systemfault> o_O
[08:35:19] <systemfault> Y2K just calledâ€¦ They want their <font> tag back.
[08:35:23] <ak5> yeah souonds weird, but I need to scrape a pages html, and boy this chinese page SUCKS
[08:35:45] <ak5> (it's also the leading search engine)
[08:35:46] <groundee> systemfault: both as i have an html response from the server but i have a small array im encoding with json_encode
[08:35:49] <ak5> in china
[08:36:06] <systemfault> ak5: Perhaps $('font[color="#008000"]')
[08:36:21] <huglester> guys, Is there a way to init ckedit in hidden div? because I need to trigger click on the upload image plugin (in toolbar). Everything works untill I hide ckeditor :(
[08:36:24] <ak5> ok, i'll take a look, thanks
[08:36:32] <ak5> not yet good with selectors
[08:36:35] <systemfault> groundee: You're not answeringâ€¦ what do you send, is it JSON OR HTML?
[08:36:59] <groundee> systemfault: json
[08:37:13] <systemfault> groundee: Then what is the HTML part?
[08:37:32] <groundee> systemfault:  the page it self
[08:39:38] <groundee> systemfault:  http://jsfiddle.net/dzA7w/
[08:40:40] <systemfault> groundee: So what's wrong now?
[08:40:56] <systemfault> Your echo json_encode should "print" the JSON
[08:41:01] <groundee> systemfault:  im sending the output to #ajaxProjectsRep in html but im wondering how to read the json
[08:42:04] <systemfault> groundee: Your code looks good
[08:42:28] <systemfault> Since you set dataType to 'json', resp should be a normal javascript object
[08:42:48] <systemfault> So resp.info and resp.chartdata should be available.
[08:44:30] <groundee> systemfault:  this is the resp im getting {"info":[{"service":"Reparacion 60kVA","status":"2"}],"chartdata":[{"service":"Reparacion 60kVA","status":"2"}]}<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" http-equiv=Content-Type>     <script>
[08:44:50] <systemfault> o_O
[08:45:01] <systemfault> Do you use some kind of framework?
[08:45:22] <groundee> systemfault:  nop
[08:45:23] <systemfault> Or you are manually adding the HTML
[08:46:00] <groundee> systemfault:  nop.. is just the response im getting from the server.. im checking in the console
[08:49:35] <maxmoore14> anyone familiar with the 2.x code? I'm trying to make this modification - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11461
[08:50:05] <maxmoore14> can't figure out where to make the change
[08:51:59] <sysdef> how can i bind all objects with id="foo"? $("#foo").click( ... only trigger the first one
[08:53:23] <systemfault> ...
[08:53:27] <graphettion> ^
[08:53:29] <systemfault> What's the definition of an ID?
[08:54:05] <sysdef> hmm.. sounds uniq, yes
[08:54:11] <graphettion> You wanting to get all elements by tag name or what?
[08:54:12] <graphettion> lol
[08:54:32] <systemfault> sysdef: Basically, if you have more than a single element with a specific ID, your HTML is invalid.
[08:55:30] <sysdef> can i use a wildcard in $("#foo").click(... ?
[08:56:38] <sysdef> name isn't uniq?
[08:57:14] <systemfault> Why don't you use classes?
[08:57:20] <sysdef> i'm not a js/jQuery/zepto-coder as you can see, lol
[08:57:21] <graphettion> or tags
[08:57:45] <graphettion> Got a buncha divs and want to do the samething $('div')
[08:57:55] <graphettion> same thing*
[08:58:10] <systemfault> sysdef: IDs are only useful for <label>s and targets, beside thatâ€¦ you can even forget they exist

[09:11:30] <aftab> I just want to run infinite scroll when the scroll bar is used on a div instead of browser scrollbar

[09:13:05] <Mohsen_Hassani> Hello guys. How can I split a word or sentence into each 4 characters for example?
[09:17:47] <zizzl> Hey has anyone here used Scrollorama http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrollorama/ ? I have a couple questions, 1st) Is there a way to trigger something if an animation starts or completes? I see they have the onBlockChange but it seems like its for every block, I want something specific, when a certain element does something, I want an icon to change
[09:21:50] <fission6> how do i remove all rows in a table that do not have '1570306' in the 3 column
[09:26:38] <Wescotte> I have a response from an ajax() call (from an SQL query) and it's formatted in JSON. I can response.rows[row][i] but is there a way where I can use like response.rows[row]["column name"]  to access the data? I want to prevent breaking my apps if I add a new column to the table
[09:26:53] <BillCriswell> fission6: $('tr').filter(function(){ return !$(this).find("td:contains('1570306')").length; }); maybe?
[09:26:57] <BillCriswell> I might have to play around a bit.
[09:28:12] <fission6> seems like it could be cleaned up a little in one select statement, at least the filter part
[09:28:30] <fission6> using :not() Selector
[09:30:55] <juoru> how can i add slice(0,6) into this? $(par).on("click","th",function()
[09:31:26] <juoru> so that it would select only 6 th
[09:32:42] <BillCriswell> juoru: th:eq(6) I believe
[09:34:10] <juoru> that doesn't seem to work
[09:36:19] <juoru> that works only with the 6th th
[09:36:38] <juoru> how to get the first 6
[09:36:45] <BillCriswell> juoru: Ohhh
[09:37:00] <BillCriswell> th:lt(6) perhaps?
[09:38:40] <fission6> BillCriswell: this works $('#all tbody td:nth-child(3)').not(':contains("1570306")').parents('tr').remove()
[09:39:50] <juoru> lt(6) works too
[09:40:14] <juoru> hoever .slice(0,6) doesn't, i wonder why?
[09:42:32] <BillCriswell> juoru: I'm not sure how you're appling it.
[09:43:21] <juoru> like this $(par).on("click","th:slice(0,6)",function()
[09:43:46] <BillCriswell> juoru: Oh, there's no slice selector in jquery.
[09:44:00] <BillCriswell> $('td').slice(0,3).on('click', foo); would work, though.
[09:44:18] <BillCriswell> Er, $('th').slice(0,6).on('click', foo);
[09:44:49] <juoru> what is that foo in there?
[09:44:56] <BillCriswell> just a function
[09:45:09] <juoru> it doesn't have to exist?
[09:45:20] <BillCriswell> No it does. It's just a fake one.
[09:45:34] <BillCriswell> $('th').slice(0,6).on('click', function(){ ... }); made more sense?
[09:46:03] <BillCriswell> s/made/make
[09:46:31] <juoru> hmm so i don't need to send parent selector to on?
[09:47:06] <juoru> wait a minute, i don't need to send child
[09:47:09] <BillCriswell> juoru: It depends.
[09:47:33] <juoru> just a sec i try
[09:47:36] <BillCriswell> If the elements are being dynamically generated and you need to use event delegation, sure thing.
[09:47:47] <BillCriswell> If they're not dynamically generated that'll work just fine.
[09:50:33] <juoru> they r dyn, but this works $(par +" th").slice(0,6).on('click', function(){...]);
[09:51:03] <juoru> well theres a typo
[09:51:10] <BillCriswell> I understand.
[09:51:42] <groundee> is something wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/pq665/ ?
[09:51:53] <juoru> thanks bill
[09:51:58] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[09:52:44] <Wescotte> I'm performing a SQL query using ajax() and the results are return in a JSON object. How can I access the results by row#, column name instead of response.rows[row#][column#]?
[09:53:36] <BillCriswell> rows[3].field_name
[09:54:11] <BillCriswell> However if response.rows[2][4] is working I don't think something is right lol
[09:54:44] <BillCriswell> You probably have an array of arrays instead of an array of json objects
[09:54:51] <groundee> thought he should use $.parseJSON for that
[09:55:22] <BillCriswell> If the datatype is set and the server is sending the right http headers it should be cool.
[09:56:31] <Wescotte> BillCriswell: yeah rows[3].field_name doesn't work.. rows[3][3] works though..
[09:57:28] <BillCriswell> Wescotte: Try doing console.table( response.rows ) and see if it looks right?
[09:57:37] <BillCriswell> BRB
[09:58:39] <benjaminbenben> came across old jquery code that where the selector is "#element/span" rather than "#element span" - did that used to work?
[10:00:36] <Wescotte> BillCriswell: It displays the contents correctly but the column headers are index numbers not the names... In the reuslts there are two arrays. One is called columns and one is called rows.. The columns contain the index # and the string name of the columns. The rows are just the data itself
[10:01:22] <Wescotte> BillCriswell: So i could make my own array and manually setup the column id # with the string but if I don't have to do that I'd prefer not to
[10:04:11] <fivehead> hi I have a very strange problem. When I go to http://daveyijzermans.nl/jquery/popover/demo.html I get an error in chrome: GET http://daveyijzermans.nl/jquery/popover/jquery.popover-1.1.2.js yet I don't get the error in firefox. In fact, a few minutes ago  when I went to the site in chrome, I wasn't getting an error. Can anyone else duplicate this problem?
[10:06:42] <fivehead> I'm experiencing the same problem when I try to use popover on my own website. It's almost like a phantom bug where on some page loads the popovers work, and then on other page loads they don't
[10:09:10] <shoky> fivehead yeah i'm seeing it too
[10:09:48] <shoky> fivehead: working fine on chrome canary...
[10:20:54] <shoky> fivehead:  you got adblock running?
[10:21:00] <shoky> fivehead: i think it's related
[10:22:39] <shoky> fivehead: yep it's adblock
[10:24:59] <fivehead> shoky ahh
[10:25:20] <fivehead> that's it... thank you
[10:25:45] <fivehead> now the question is how do I do this so adblock doesn't disable functionality on my page
[10:25:57] <shoky> no idea what's the actual cause..
[10:26:09] <fivehead> I'll google around
[10:31:57] <BillCriswell> Wescotte: Sounds like fun haha
[10:32:04] <s2013> any rails dev here?
[10:34:40] <Wescotte> BillCriswell: Did you see the message just before that? It appears the column strings aren't included in the object in a way were console.table() recognizes them. Which I assume is the problem?
[10:35:52] <BillCriswell> Wescotte: It's just returning an array of arrays instead of an array of objects. If it was an array of objects it'd get the proper headers.
[10:36:12] <lamarus> given thisâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/bretterer/CqLsw/   Why do you have to enter the box.. leave the boxâ€¦ and enter again before the slideDown/slideUp begins to work?
[10:38:49] <Wescotte> BillCriswell: Ah well, I can make due. Thanks!
[10:39:56] <zizzl> Hey has anyone here used Scrollorama http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrollorama/ ? I have a couple questions, 1st) Is there a way to trigger something if an animation starts or completes? I see they have the onBlockChange but it seems like its for every block, I want something specific, when a certain element does something, I want an icon to change
[10:41:57] <jacobroufa> zizzl: just do $( element ).on( 'change', function() { /*change icon here*/ });
[10:45:12] <zizzl> jacobroufa awesome thanks, so if i needed the 'change' part to be when #icon-row-wrap .icons .home has top: 200px how would I put that in there?
[10:45:35] <jacobroufa> zizzle just check that at the top of your function
[10:45:59] <lamarus> Any thoughts anyoneâ€¦ Im lost
[10:47:46] <zizzl> jacobroufa, sorry I don't follow, just starting to learn, I understand the rest of your code just not the 'change' part
[10:48:02] <jacobroufa> zizzl: i think the onBlockChange function is what you want though
[10:48:06] <zizzl> how to translate element's css top property
[10:48:52] <zizzl> jacobroufa, actually I think you're on the better track.. I just need an "if css is this, then produce this css"
[10:49:12] <zizzl> because the onBlockChange I think is just for the major blocks and I'm targeting something inside there
[10:49:30] <jacobroufa> $( element ).css( 'top' ) === pixelHeightHere
[10:49:42] <jacobroufa> like that??
[10:52:07] <ql4132> cool
[10:52:40] <zizzl> jacobroufa, but how do I make that an if, then statement

[11:03:13] <imrobert> Is there a "startsWith" function in query?
[11:03:29] <imrobert> i.e. I'm trying to find whether a string starts with another?
[11:03:33] <imrobert> I know how to do it in JS
[11:03:40] <NoiseEee> imrobert: jquery is JS
[11:03:40] <imrobert> It'd just be cleaner with a simple function call
[11:03:44] <danheberden> don't they know that VINs are 17 characters, not 24?
[11:03:46] <imrobert> NoiseEee: I meant pure JS
[11:03:52] <imrobert> i.e. no jquery
[11:04:02] <imrobert> raw js whatever you want to call it
[11:04:17] <NoiseEee> imrobert: you'd still have to use JS string methods for what you want
[11:04:35] <imrobert> NoiseEee: Does jQuery not alter core prototypes anywhere?
[11:04:42] <NoiseEee> imrobert: nowhere :)
[11:04:46] <zizzl> jacobroufa, shouldn't this work 	if ($('.headlines .one').css('top') === '110') { 	    $('#icon-row-wrap .icons .home').css('background-position-y','-418'); 	}
[11:04:46] <imrobert> interesting
[11:05:03] <imrobert> NoiseEee: Then I guess this isn't a query type of thing :)
[11:07:03] <zizzl> ^^ can anyone tell me what's wrong with that line
[11:08:12] <snover> css units have units.

[11:08:53] <imrobert> dominicwatson: ghostjs?
[11:09:17] <zizzl> shoky so add 'px' to each number I have up there?
[11:09:45] <zizzl> if ($('.headlines .one').css('top') === '110px') { 	    $('#icon-row-wrap .icons .home').css('background-position-y','-418px'); 	}
[11:09:50] <snover> dominicwatson: yes, if you actually want to test in real browsers; http://github.com/theintern/intern can help
[11:09:53] <shoky> zizzl:  or parseInt(cssval, 10) to get a number
[11:09:54] <rabx> Hello - can someone suggest a jquery plugin for virtual tour. I'd like to use something like google street view if possible

[11:10:41] <shoky> zizzl: i can't know that just by looking at that one line of code.
[11:10:58] <vinex08> hi, anyone knows whats this effect called http://www.cleanenergycap.com/
[11:11:10] <vinex08> Services and Sectors Hover
[11:11:23] <maxmoore14> could I possibly use a dataFilter to grab the raw response and then abort the rest of the processing?
[11:11:30] <zizzl> shoky but as far as jquery goes there's nothing wrong with it?
[11:11:42] <dominicwatson> ok cool, so Intern says that it has grunt supportâ€¦. but I guess this is only for unit testing without DOM?
[11:12:09] <shoky> zizzl: uhh as far as having no syntax errors or using non-existing API.. sure, nothing wrong
[11:12:16] <maxmoore14> the problem is, jquery is throwing an error on line 7841 because responseText is not available
[11:12:44] <maxmoore14> my preference would be to NOT edit jquery
[11:12:51] <zizzl> shoky I just want to say when  .headlines .one reaches a top: 110px then to change the icon bg of #icon-row-wrap .icons .home using sprites
[11:14:12] <shoky> zizzl: did you console.log it.. does it ever log 110px
[11:14:27] <shoky> zizzl: again, i cant help without seeing it for myself
[11:15:25] <zizzl> shoky it said "345px
[11:15:27] <zizzl> "
[11:15:27] <zizzl> haha
[11:15:46] <shoky> zizzl: btw if im not mistaken background-position-y  doesn't work on firefox

[11:24:47] <RandalSchwartz> then we can fiddle :)
[11:25:05] <sunbeam> ok
[11:26:40] <imrobert> I should be able to variable = $("span .class");
[11:26:41] <imrobert> right?
[11:26:54] <imrobert> then variable.css("color", "yellow");
[11:28:08] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to abort an ajax request within a datafilter?

[11:28:59] <vinex08> anyone?
[11:29:05] <zizzl> shoky oh haha sorry
[11:29:24] <dominicwatson> ok so JS unit tests are usually performed on a separate HTML file. I was thinking they had to be tested in their current environment
[11:30:39] <RandalSchwartz> span..span..span..span..span..span..span..span... beautfiful span, wonderful span... wonderful span, beautiful span!

[11:34:02] <sunbeam> anyone else ?
[11:34:06] <sunbeam>  http://jsfiddle.net/kCnqK/
[11:34:17] <sunbeam> how can i move the <input type="radio"> 3 levels up. so that it is the first child of  <span class="container">
[11:36:01] <imrobert> Shouldn't variable = $("selector"); save the match group in variable?
[11:36:17] <imrobert> So I can use it like variable.attribute("X") later?
[11:36:51] <chovy> .

[11:42:33] <imrobert> It's not working for me, but I figure it might be some other problem.
[11:44:57] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to abort an ajax request within a datafilter?
[12:03:44] <dcherman> maxmoore14: does dataFilter === prefilter?
[12:04:16] <graphettion> sunbeam: This work? - http://jsfiddle.net/kCnqK/2/
[12:06:27] <maxmoore14> dcherman: no, it gets the raw response back before data processing
[12:07:03] <dcherman> maxmoore14: then at that point, no - the request is already successful, you can't abort there
[12:07:29] <maxmoore14> dcherman: is there a way to prevent the rest of the callbacks?
[12:07:36] <danheberden> maxmoore14: https://gist.github.com/danheberden/1641098 might help
[12:08:13] <dcherman> maxmoore14: you'd have to do a custom prefilter, pretty much like danheberden just posted.
[12:10:50] <maxmoore14> danheberden: interesting. so you are basically copying any existing handlers, then aborting the original request?
[12:12:09] <danheberden> maxmoore14: creating a new promise onto the jqXHR `dfd.promise( jqXHR )` and adding additional calls to run the success/error callbacks
[12:12:34] <danheberden> the returned promise from, say, $.ajax() would be this new promise so that's all cool
[12:13:17] <danheberden> it's old and is just for my slide-deck, but might be a good starting point :)
[12:13:39] <danheberden> either way, you can have your way with the jqXHR in the prefilter
[12:14:56] <maxmoore14> danheberden: my problem is that when I request binary data with responseType: 'arraybuffer' the $.ajax complete method calls responseText which throws an error
[12:15:25] <danheberden> maxmoore14: you might want to create a custom transport
[12:15:38] <danheberden> and then $.ajax({... type: 'arraybufferthingy' })
[12:15:41] <danheberden> or whatever
[12:15:54] <danheberden> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport/
[12:16:46] <maxmoore14> danheberden: ok, thanks. I haven't done that before. I'll see if I can figure it out.
[12:16:46] <dcherman> maxmoore14: what version of jQuery are you using?  that was fixed in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/484cea1b5651d215a24d3a6827663a4e16a6a253
[12:17:12] <maxmoore14> I'm using 2.0.2
[12:18:57] <maxmoore14> dcherman: that is different than the code I have - http://jsbin.com/ehadop/1/edit - that is line 7835 in my copy
[12:19:37] <dcherman> maxmoore14: try using 1.9 - it looks like it should work.  ill bet if you report it, it'd be addressed since it seems like a regression in IE9
[12:20:19] <maxmoore14> ok, thanks, I'll give it a try

[12:27:46] <OnceMe> hey yall Im just wondering why this does not show red on scrollÂ http://jsfiddle.net/5D82m/
[12:27:54] <OnceMe> what did I do wrong?
[12:30:50] <c4ptnh00k2> OnceMe: http://jsfiddle.net/5D82m/1/
[12:31:07] <c4ptnh00k2> one condition hit and the others are ignored
[12:32:10] <graphettion> OnceMe: You needed to change your less thans to greater thans. But c4pth00k2's example is better with && for in between.
[12:33:36] <graphettion> I mean greater thans to less thans, fml
[12:33:53] <noregret> I have a <a> inside a <td>, i'm trying to get the first <td> among its siblings, one the <a> click event, i have $(this).parent().first() which is not working, since first() is giving the current <td> how can I get the first <td> among the siblings ?
[12:34:48] <c4ptnh00k2> noregret: step 1. mock up what you have in jsfiddle   step 2. We fix it for you and show you how
[12:34:58] <graphettion> ^
[12:38:04] <Fenikkusu> I'm working on a project that had additions added after the fact. It was built on jQuery, but these additions require classic javascript. Specifically, I need to pass the 'this' object to a function as if I was calling the function from the element's onclick attribute, but from the context of an onclick event. Any thoughts?
[12:38:27] <Fenikkusu> from the context of a jquery click event function*
[12:39:42] <dcherman> Fenikkusu: use .call or .apply - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[12:40:36] <noregret> c4ptnh00k2: http://jsfiddle.net/aC4hr/ i expected this to print 'webui'
[12:41:36] <wizbit> how can i stop 2 jquery libs conflicting on a webpage?
[12:41:39] <noregret> c4ptnh00k2: on any <a> click ie
[12:41:44] <Eviltwin> noregret: this is the <a> tag, <td> is its parent
[12:41:46] <NoiseEee> wizbit: why are there 2?
[12:41:56] <wizbit> i am using a script what uses a older version
[12:41:58] <noregret> Eviltwin: yeah, so ?
[12:42:13] <Eviltwin> So you've selected the <td> and printed its text
[12:42:28] <c4ptnh00k2> yup ^
[12:43:04] <Eviltwin> Here's one way to fix it: http://jsfiddle.net/aC4hr/1/
[12:45:18] <Fenikkusu> dherman, thank you but not quite what I need. The context from which the function is called doesn't matter. It's the object being passed to the function. IE: <a href="#" onclick="myFunction(this)" class="a">A Link</a><script>$(function(){$(".a").click(function(){myFunction(<what goes here>);}); function myFunction(var) { console.log(var);  }</script>
[12:45:53] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[12:46:00] <Eviltwin> Please don't use attributes for event listeners
[12:47:30] <Fenikkusu> ...I did say 'IE'...
[12:47:45] <wizbit> if i use this
[12:47:47] <wizbit> <script>var $jq142 = jQuery.noConflict();</script>
[12:47:54] <wizbit> what else do i need to do?
[12:48:06] <Fenikkusu> Though quite frankly I'm not sure what you mean by using attributes for listeners.
[12:50:38] <Omermuneer> guys
[12:50:50] <noregret> Eviltwin: right, that's what i want..
[12:51:32] <noregret> Eviltwin: you solution doesn't always print 'webui'
[12:51:40] <noregret> Eviltwin: it prints prev
[12:52:26] <OnceMe> c4ptnh00k2:thanks
[12:52:36] <OnceMe> graphettion:thanbs
[12:53:10] <OnceMe> uhm one more question, how would I do this in loop?
[12:53:18] <OnceMe> When it comes to bigger then 1000, to start all over..?
[12:54:42] <noregret> Eviltwin: i want to always print first <td> when any anchor is clicked
[12:55:29] <noregret> c4ptnh00k2: ^
[12:56:25] <Eviltwin> noregret: Dude, try it out
[12:57:08] <Eviltwin> noregret: This: http://jsfiddle.net/aC4hr/2/
[12:57:09] <shoky> wizbit: you shouldn't have jquery included more than once
[12:57:11] <graphettion> OnceMe: Why would you need a loop for that? Wouldn't that be another if statement for 1000?
[12:57:22] <OnceMe> yes
[12:57:31] <graphettion> There ya go.
[12:57:33] <graphettion> :)
[12:57:44] <noregret> Eviltwin: yes, taht worked out :) unlike the previous pasate
[12:59:21] <c4ptnh00k2> sorry for late responses im at work lol they actually pay me, but I see shoky is here so there you go. he's better than I so everyone should bug him lol
[13:00:41] <graphettion> People have so much faith in money, pfff!
[13:01:40] <jedimind> its not really faith so much as it is a necessity of life
[13:02:03] <c4ptnh00k2> what he said
[13:06:54] <spascalb> testing
[13:07:09] <jedimind> failed
[13:07:36] <c4ptnh00k2> server timeout
[13:08:02] <shoky> E_UNEXPECTED_FISH
[13:08:33] <jedimind> what kind of fish is unexpected?
[13:08:36] <jedimind> fish should always be expected
[13:08:39] <c4ptnh00k2> i just hate that error
[13:10:13] <Gho5t> i'm into it
[13:10:53] <c4ptnh00k2> I'm looking for a good looking and extremely customizable alternative to jqgrid.. any ideas?
[13:11:26] <graphettion> jedimind: Oh, you're talking about fiat money.
[13:11:53] <Gho5t> KendoUI perhaps
[13:29:14] <wcwrel> how do i iterate all elements that have a src= attribute?
[13:30:12] <c4ptnh00k2> why would you?
[13:30:30] <c4ptnh00k2> better to add a selector than to use attributed
[13:30:36] <c4ptnh00k2> attribute
[13:30:38] <luxigo> $('[src]') ?
[13:30:59] <foofoobar> Hi. var foo = $('#myId'); how to get now a "subset" of foo ? $(foo).$('.sub') does not work
[13:31:02] <luxigo> $('[src]') .each(function(i,elem)..
[13:32:36] <foofoobar> any hints?
[13:33:25] <samsoft> hello house...
[13:33:43] <c4ptnh00k2> foofoobar: really vague, but .sub() is depricated
[13:34:02] <c4ptnh00k2> samsoft: hello...
[13:34:16] <NoiseEee> foofoobar: a 'subset'?  like a class/element within $(foo) ?
[13:34:48] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/find/ @ foofoobar
[13:34:51] <foofoobar> NoiseEee: I want to get $('#myId .sub')
[13:35:07] <NoiseEee> foofoobar: that'd work, what you just wrote, as well.
[13:35:10] <foofoobar> But the #myId part is saved in a var like this: var foo =$('#myId')
[13:35:28] <foofoobar> NoiseEee: $(foo).$('.sub') this?
[13:35:35] <luxigo> foofoobar:
[13:35:36] <NoiseEee> no.
[13:35:38] <c4ptnh00k2> no
[13:35:44] <NoiseEee> foofoobar: what you JUST wrote, or see http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:35:52] <luxigo> foofoobar: $('.sub',foo)
[13:35:58] <NoiseEee> crist
[13:36:15] <NoiseEee> $(foo).find('.sub') = all element in foo with the class 'sub'
[13:36:39] <luxigo> $('.sub',foo) = all .sub from foo
[13:36:54] <c4ptnh00k2> $('#myId .sub') is what you just typed and it will work
[13:37:11] <foofoobar> c4ptnh00k2: yes but I do not have a string with '#myId' available
[13:37:19] <foofoobar> I have the already selected element
[13:37:20] <luxigo> foo is variable
[13:37:32] <luxigo> can be element
[13:37:42] <luxigo> var foo=
[13:37:55] <wcwrel> luxigo: yep that worked google helped as well
[13:38:02] <luxigo> damn return key too small
[13:38:53] <NoiseEee> $(foo).find('.sub') = all element in foo with the class 'sub' @ fucking foofoobar
[13:38:55] <shoky> strictly speaking a subset would be with .filter(...)
[13:39:00] <shoky> or any filtering method
[13:39:48] <foofoobar> NoiseEee: do you have a problem?
[13:39:53] <Ice_Strike> What the best way that a bar can have different colour of background - a bar can have 4 sets/parts
[13:39:57] <foofoobar> Stop insulting me kid
[13:40:06] <Ice_Strike> also different width of set in a bar
[13:40:16] <mydog2> jquery concatenation --- a dot .  or a plu +
[13:40:38] <shoky> WtF.
[13:42:38] <c4ptnh00k2> oh wow this room has digressed
[13:43:15] <shoky> everybody has eaten some bad fish
[13:43:39] <luxigo> jquery-ui dilaog size and position should be persitent as long  you dont reload the page, as mentioned here... http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4654 ?...    but looks like they dont anymore...  returning false from 'destroy' doesnt help... and hide/show closest .ui-dialog is not working... any idea ?
[13:43:39] <graphettion> They seen my neck beard prolly.
[13:44:16] <c4ptnh00k2> mydog2: This is easily googled, but if you are trying to concatinate a sting just use " " + " "
[13:44:35] <Ice_Strike> I want a bar have like 5 sets - what the best way to do that?
[13:45:12] <shoky> | | | | | |
[13:45:17] <Ice_Strike> Yes like that
[13:45:22] <shoky> that's the best way.
[13:45:39] <c4ptnh00k2> lol
[13:45:41] <Ice_Strike> each set have different background and each size as well
[13:45:42] <graphettion> lol
[13:46:16] <c4ptnh00k2> you did not specify what kind of bar
[13:46:34] <NoiseEee> i'm crossing fingers its an open bar
[13:46:47] <Ice_Strike> Well I want a bar to show memory used
[13:46:59] <Ice_Strike> each set mean each hard drive
[13:47:02] <culh> at least it's not jail bars
[13:47:04] <c4ptnh00k2> like a segmented progress bar?
[13:47:22] <c4ptnh00k2> or 5 different bars?
[13:47:36] <Ice_Strike> segmented progress bar
[13:47:51] <Ice_Strike> let me show u 1 sec
[13:47:58] <c4ptnh00k2> ok there you go i now begin your googling
[13:48:56] <c4ptnh00k2> sorry got bored and did it for you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13623987/segmented-progressbar-jquery-ui
[13:49:05] <graphettion> lol
[13:50:37] <Ice_Strike> Like this: http://s22.postimg.org/nfbmqrzht/bar2.png
[13:51:02] <Ice_Strike> hmm

[13:51:55] <graphettion> c4ptnh00k2: Stop holding people's hand while they shit. It's not attractive.
[13:52:43] <c4ptnh00k2> graphettion: now now even you crapped your own pants at one time or another.
[13:52:49] <c4ptnh00k2> :P
[13:52:53] <graphettion> lmao
[13:53:22] <jedimind> i like providing emotional support with hand holding
[13:53:25] <jedimind> esp when pooping
[13:53:31] <graphettion> ^
[13:53:47] <c4ptnh00k2> Jedimind: Agreed, it's an emotional relief...
[13:53:56] <jedimind> just knowing that someone's there for you helps
[13:54:09] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: I need you in about 15mins, I had a burger for lunch, and it's making me emotional
[13:54:13] <mydog2> c4ptnh00k2,  - i know.. but sometimes.. it's faster to do a uick hit here.. than fire up a browser, etc..
[13:54:23] <mydog2> but yeah.. it's googled!
[13:54:25] <jedimind> ryanneufeld i'm there for you buddy
[13:54:36] <mydog2> c4ptnh00k2, thanks!
[13:54:41] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: I swear it won't be like last time... I hope.
[13:54:41] <c4ptnh00k2> mydog2: Then you are lazy and should go jump off a mountain lol
[13:54:44] <mydog2> hey shoky !!
[13:54:52] <jedimind> ryanneufeld i should hope not
[13:55:00] <mydog2> c4ptnh00k2, as long as you're there to catch me..
[13:55:14] <c4ptnh00k2> I have really bad aim...
[13:55:25] <shoky> halu mydog2
[13:56:23] <c4ptnh00k2> i even miss the keys im trying to press from time to time
[13:56:37] <c4ptnh00k2> like the shift key apparently
[13:58:19] <luxigo> oh i have to hide on beforeclose :-)
[13:59:13] <c4ptnh00k2> luxigo: Oh wow, completely missed your question. sry :P
[14:01:11] <samsoft> Please i need help... can someone share with me the knowledge of MVC
[14:01:19] <jedimind> lol
[14:01:40] <graphettion> jedimind: Get your hand out.
[14:02:45] <c4ptnh00k2> samsoft: I use mvc. what is your desired knowledge
[14:02:50] <c4ptnh00k2> ?
[14:02:58] <jedimind> he wants you to explain to him what mvc is
[14:03:02] <jedimind> 140 characters or less
[14:03:09] <c4ptnh00k2> model view controller
[14:03:11] <graphettion> Twitter style
[14:03:12] <c4ptnh00k2> done
[14:03:24] <graphettion> That was a short shit.
[14:03:39] <c4ptnh00k2> graphettion: thought they used mvvm
[14:03:58] <graphettion> c4ptnh00k2: lol
[14:05:03] <graphettion> Model = database, view = front-end, controller = programming logic
[14:05:12] <graphettion> That's all I got.
[14:05:19] <c4ptnh00k2> ... sorta
[14:05:35] <graphettion> If only models were sexy.
[14:06:03] <c4ptnh00k2> if the model is a db then you would be atleast 90% right lol
[14:06:14] <c4ptnh00k2> and dbs are never sexy
[14:06:16] <samsoft> c4ptnh00k2: Thanks you.. i want to know the arrangement of files.. and how it work together
[14:06:34] <graphettion> c4ptnh00k2: Haha. An A is an A.
[14:06:40] <samsoft> Any resource will be appreciated
[14:06:49] <green-> is there an event function similar to mouseover() and mousenter() that won't refire everytime the mouse moves within an element? I want it to fire when it goes over, but not again until it moves out and back in
[14:06:59] <c4ptnh00k2> samsoft: http://tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/model-view-controller-explained/
[14:07:14] <green-> i could maintain a flag myself, but would rather avoid it if there's something that already does this
[14:07:39] <samsoft> i'm watching a tutorial video now... things are just getting worse... so i decided to talk to you guys
[14:08:18] <graphettion> samsoft: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/mvc-for-noobs/
[14:08:20] <c4ptnh00k2> samsoft: Well this is a jquery channel, but the idea is in the blog i sent you
[14:08:32] <diamonds> heyo
[14:08:56] <diamonds> $.each(window.frames,function(index...
[14:08:59] <c4ptnh00k2> graphettion's example is too long of a read lol
[14:09:16] <diamonds> in zepto this is an array of window frames; index is an int
[14:09:17] <samsoft> and the reason why i'm learning this is because i am working with Jobberbase framework and i need to add additional page which i find hard to do
[14:09:29] <samsoft> Thanks you Graphettion: you are wonderful
[14:09:49] <graphettion> Whatever.
[14:09:51] <graphettion> lol jk
[14:10:02] <diamonds> in jquery 2 it uses the keys of each window frame or something, so indes is top,window,location,external,chrome,intl,v8Intl,etc.
[14:10:25] <samsoft> well, appreciate
[14:10:28] <diamonds> how can I produce the zepto behavior? am I using $.each wrong?
[14:10:48] <graphettion> samsoft: No problem, you're welcome man!
[14:10:53] <pixel_> hi
[14:10:57] <c4ptnh00k2> hey
[14:10:58] <diamonds> hi pixel_!
[14:11:01] <pixel_> :)
[14:11:07] <pixel_> how are you today?
[14:11:42] <c4ptnh00k2> tired, working, annoyed, and frankly a little bloated.. where is jedimind when you need him
[14:11:56] <pixel_> :)
[14:11:59] <jedimind> I CANT BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
[14:12:03] <jedimind> so many people to comfort so little hands
[14:12:03] <c4ptnh00k2> lol
[14:12:52] <graphettion> jedimind: Sure you can, you're a jedi.
[14:13:01] <jedimind> im a jedi, not jesus
[14:13:03] <maxmoore14> danheberden: you still around? I have a question about ajaxTransport...
[14:13:39] <graphettion> Two fictional characters.
[14:13:40] <pixel_> is there a php + jquery library that you can recommend i could use to display a nice panel with tree structure ( folders and files ) of a directory on my server? basically, something that outputs my server   specified folder tree structure to client browser in a form that the jquery script gets as input and shows the foldernames and images in there?
[14:13:53] <maxmoore14> trying to do something like this... http://jsbin.com/utifes/1/edit
[14:14:10] <c4ptnh00k2> graphettion: wo wo wo wait just a second there
[14:14:27] <c4ptnh00k2> jesus is my gardner thank you very much
[14:14:30] <maxmoore14> but it obviously doesn't work - among other things, xhr is just a function to create the xhr object.
[14:14:54] <maxmoore14> so I could do something like var myxhr = options.xhr() and then work with that
[14:14:56] <graphettion> c4ptnh00k2: I pray to those gardners all the time for food on my table.
[14:15:26] <c4ptnh00k2> well he atleast trims the hedges and edges the sidewalk when he comesby every other week
[14:15:36] <graphettion> lol
[14:15:52] <maxmoore14> but my real question is, how do I manipulate the underlying jqXHR and have it apply all the options & send as it normally would?
[14:18:00] <c4ptnh00k2> maxmoore14: did you include jquery
[14:18:02] <c4ptnh00k2> ?
[14:18:51] <maxmoore14> c4ptnh00k2: yes, I'm thinking what I will actually do is just reuse some code within jquery
[14:19:35] <c4ptnh00k2> btw whoever said jquery file upload plugin was easy to implement is a jackass
[14:20:42] <utroda> Any idea on you would you prepend an object to an array to inherit the first index of that array?
[14:21:22] <pixel_> hmm
[14:21:23] <pixel_> i have this folder full of photos, organized in subfolders, on my server. I need to let the visitor of the site choose a foto... what is the best and most beautifyl way to do it? I need to display the folders and photos to the user for him to be easy to chose one of them, i don't want to use a photo gallery that has previsous and next buttons.. instead i want all the pictures inside the selected
[14:21:23] <pixel_> folder to be displayed.. like in an open file windows content
[14:21:48] <c4ptnh00k2> utroda: unshift() i think
[14:22:07] <utroda> c4ptnh00k2: thanks
[14:22:32] <c4ptnh00k2> utroda: np hope that works
[14:23:40] <c4ptnh00k2> pixel_: you should use the jquery file upload plugin...
[14:23:55] <pixel_> c4ptnh00k2 thank you
[14:24:07] <pixel_> but isn't that showing the files on visitor computer?
[14:24:28] <pixel_> i need to display the pictures from my server folder.. and let him choose one
[14:25:20] <jedimind> pixel_ there are several steps you need to take
[14:25:35] <jedimind> between images on a file system to displaying them in a browser
[14:25:48] <jedimind> and most of those steps dont have anything to do with jquery
[14:26:04] <c4ptnh00k2> no wax on wax off?
[14:26:23] <jedimind> i do have a php file i wrote like â€¦ before ww2
[14:26:34] <jedimind> that will list a directory of images, create thumbnails, display them in a list
[14:26:39] <jedimind> using imagemagic to create thumbnails
[14:26:48] <c4ptnh00k2> lol anyways im out guys ttyl
[14:26:53] <jedimind> lates
[14:27:02] <pixel_> i am thinking to create a list of the folders and files from php, output it to my webpage in somevariables, and then use jquery to display them and let user interact with the folder structure displayed
[14:27:18] <jedimind> so once you have them in html
[14:27:25] <jedimind> there are a huge number of jquery based gallery plugins
[14:27:29] <jedimind> that are entirely subjective
[14:27:32] <jedimind> just use the googles
[14:27:34] <pixel_> jedimind that php file you wrote would be great! can you share it with me?
[14:27:43] <jedimind> id have to dig it up
[14:28:13] <pixel_> i googled for jquery based gallery plugins.. but all that i found shows a big foto and then 4 or 5 thunmbnails with the previsious and next buttons
[14:28:50] <pixel_> i need something that does not show any big photo, instead just a matrix of thumbnails plus the subfolders
[14:29:02] <pixel_> so the user can choose the photo
[14:29:20] <pixel_> and this should be stored in a form field
[14:30:33] <pixel_> basically there is a form field, named background.. when user clicks on it i want to display a div with the structure of my background folders, and thumbnails... when the user choses a photo the div will dissapear and the selected fotoname will be placed in the form field value
[14:37:22] <pixel_> i can write a simple php script that outputs to webpage the directory structure.. ex folder1/pic.jpg /folder1/pic2.jpg folder2/pic.jpg etc... i need jquery to create a nice display and let user navigate through folders and select a pic
[14:37:26] <green-> i can't make sense of why mouseover() and mouseout() are being called when mousing over something
[14:40:19] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, I am trying to install datetime-local polyfill. Everything worked great but on internet explorer it had a problem - the box still comes up but shows a bunch of NaN errors.
[14:41:09] <green-> the mouseout event is triggering when moving the mouse *within* the element, not out of it
[14:43:57] <shoky> `demo @ Pinkamena_D
[14:43:57] <b-ot> Pinkamena_D: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:44:25] <shoky> green-: sounds like you might want mouseenter/mouseexit instead
[14:44:42] <green-> shoky: just tried mouseenter/mouseleave and got the same results
[14:44:51] <shoky> oops mouseleave ye
[14:45:01] <shoky> green-: then make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[14:45:09] <alaing> hi I have a line of code which is working in FF21 but not IE7. if(item){}else{}
[14:45:10] <green-> mouseleave actually fires first
[14:45:21] <alaing> i have narrowed it down to that line
[14:45:34] <shoky> alaing: "working"?
[14:45:39] <solancer> hey guys
[14:46:13] <shoky> why is anyone still trying to make shit work on IE7 :\
[14:46:18] <green-> shoky: probably headed out in a minute, won't have time to get it together. was hoping it was something simple i was missing.
[14:46:34] <alaing> shoky its a piece of code from flot jquery plugin which displays a tooltip when a user hovers over a data point on a chart
[14:46:47] <shoky> alaing: i thought it was just if(item){}else{}
[14:46:58] <alaing> shoky: long story but I work for a gov department......enough said :-D
[14:47:15] <shoky> alaing heh k
[14:47:23] <solancer> I have 2 jquery plugins, one creates a bunch of html lists and the other is trying to turn it into a carousel slider
[14:47:29] <alaing> shoky its the testing of item
[14:47:41] <shoky> alaing: notice you still haven't said what the problem is
[14:47:57] <alaing> lol - long day :-D
[14:48:10] <solancer> for someone reason the second plugin is not able find the ul created on the fly
[14:48:11] <shoky> and as usual, a jsfiddle/demo would be best
[14:48:27] <solancer> does anyone know why?
[14:48:48] <shoky> solancer: nobody can read your mind or your code. it's all working great in our imagination
[14:48:49] <devslash> im trying to implement this calendar on my site: http://www.web-delicious.com/jquery-plugins-demo/wdCalendar/sample.php. i want to capture the event when the user clicks on the calendar and prevent a new event from being added. ive done debugging and have the event $("#dvCalMain").click(function(event) but i cant prevent the purple box and bubble from appearing when you click on the calendar
[14:49:52] <alaing> shoky IE  is running the else block when it should be running the if block like it does in FF
[14:49:56] <solancer> shoky, oh right the code
[14:50:24] <shoky> alaing: see what i just told solancer
[14:50:51] <devslash> can anyone help me figure this out ?
[14:51:08] <solancer> shoky, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5778467/
[14:52:00] <GaryOak_> How does jquery toggle() know the previous display state?
[14:52:03] <solancer> shoky, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5778472/
[14:52:12] <monokrome> What can I use for the opposite of jQuery.param()? I want to get an object containing a list of the params
[14:52:53] <alaing> shoky : https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/examples/interacting/index.html its line 67
[14:53:03] <monokrome> so if my URL is http://example.com/?bananas=true&strawberries=false then I would expect { bananas: true, strawberries: false }
[14:53:09] <luxigo> GaryOak_: is(':visible')
[14:53:10] <monokrome> Does jQuery do this or should I just manually regex it?
[14:53:34] <solancer> shoky, #pd-pics is jus an empty div
[14:53:48] <GaryOak_> luxigo: I mean like if it was inline-block before it will change to none, and then it knows to go back to inline-block
[14:54:15] <pixel_> ok
[14:54:16] <shoky> solancer: looks like that flickr plugin is doing ajax requests, but it's not providing an option for you to give it a callback to call when its done doing its thing
[14:54:20] <pixel_> so now i know what i am looking for
[14:54:28] <shoky> solancer: the reason your 2nd script doesnt find the element is because it's not there yet
[14:54:35] <shoky> solancer: (probably)
[14:54:53] <pixel_> i need a treeview component with thumbnails of pictures that shoes the content of specified folder on my server
[14:55:16] <luxigo> GaryOak.: maybe saving css('display') using data()  ... juste check jquery.js uncompressed :-)
[14:55:23] <solancer> shoky, oh thats fascinating how can I fix it?
[14:56:01] <GaryOak_> luxigo: I guess that's why it's open source, thanks
[14:57:52] <shoky> jesus i hate pastebins that dont let you re-paste it
[14:57:56] <devslash> ccan someone help me out ?

[15:02:10] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, I was here asking this before but my computer crashed so I apoligize for asking again.
[15:02:52] <Pinkamena_D> Anyway, I an trying to install datetime-polyfill, but in internet explorer I get a "NaNNaNNaNNaNN" showing up all over the calander
[15:03:22] <devslash> i did

[15:03:33] <shoky> solancer: haven't tested any of that, of course..
[15:04:33] <devslash> chovy i did try that. that prevents the bubble  from appearing but the event apppears in purple
[15:05:55] <solancer> shoky, oh thanks
[15:06:12] <solancer> shoky, ah an error http://paste.ubuntu.com/5778508/
[15:07:30] <shoky> solancer did you replace the flickr.js  code?
[15:07:42] <solancer> shoky, yep I did
[15:07:57] <solancer> shoky, I jus double checked
[15:08:23] <shoky> solancer: mm what jquery version you using..?

[15:24:08] <shoky> yer welcome
[15:24:47] <solancer> shoky, I've always hated javascript but I guess its time for me to start learning it
[15:25:37] <solancer> shoky, I've been shamelessly using open source plugins for all these years it high time I start writing my own
[15:26:28] <shoky> yep you should. it'll make webdev much more fun
[15:27:25] <solancer> shoky, yep I agree
[15:29:25] <Bothering> shud wat
[15:29:27] <Bothering> :\
[15:29:51] <Bothering> solancer: look into backbone

[15:30:14] <Bothering> underscore.js
[15:30:26] <Bothering> iz prety fun
[15:30:26] <solancer> Bothering, wow thats a lot of js
[15:30:38] <Bothering> jus look up backbone js todo app
[15:30:51] <solancer> Bothering, I heard a lot about undrscore
[15:30:59] <Bothering> its a clintside sort of mvc like framework
[15:31:08] <shoky> let the dude learn javascript first..
[15:31:13] <snover> uh
[15:31:14] <snover> yeah
[15:31:26] <snover> putting the (shitty) cart way before the horse here
[15:31:27] <Bothering> not necesarily
[15:31:56] <Bothering> solancer: do u know MVC?
[15:32:03] <shoky> :\
[15:32:27] <Bothering> client side frameworks r a nitemare btw
[15:32:30] <solancer> Bothering, yeah I do
[15:32:31] <Pinkamena_D> b-ot, thank you for the reply
[15:32:33] <snover> no, they arenâ€™t
[15:32:38] <Bothering> but its worth it i guess
[15:32:38] <snover> only the bad ones are a nightmare
[15:32:43] <solancer> Bothering, I work with django
[15:32:50] <Bothering> oh python
[15:32:55] <Pinkamena_D> Internet explorer 10 seems to work fine, but not 9.
[15:33:03] <Bothering> i have used it
[15:33:06] <Bothering> django
[15:33:09] <Pinkamena_D> the site is www.jewellsmusicstudio.tk/newform.php
[15:33:30] <Bothering> solancer: u know jquery?
[15:33:37] <solancer> Bothering, but now I'm jus using flask and webapp2 for the most
[15:33:48] <Bothering> coz u dun realy need to know javascript really
[15:33:52] <solancer> Bothering, nope not really
[15:34:12] <Bothering> ya jus learn how to write ur own jquery code
[15:34:27] <Bothering> ill prety much be forced to learn js
[15:34:30] <Bothering> u
[15:34:37] <solancer> Bothering, I've managed to use javascript plugins and scripts from the internet
[15:34:44] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: i'm in IE9.. where am i supposed to be seeing NaN?
[15:34:48] <solancer> Bothering, but its time I start learning it
[15:34:58] <Bothering> its prety small
[15:35:24] <Bothering> plus if ur writing js u probly shud stop
[15:35:34] <Bothering> and use jquery
[15:35:35] <Bothering> lol
[15:37:21] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: the polyfill seems to be working fine.. i see the jquery-ui datepicker working fine
[15:38:37] <Pinkamena_D> ok, I have just checked again
[15:38:48] <Pinkamena_D> some of the people here still use ie8
[15:38:53] <Pinkamena_D> do you have that around?
[15:39:14] <Pinkamena_D> (I am still downloading all of the vms as we speak to test with)
[15:39:18] <shoky> browserstack does
[15:39:42] <shoky> but no need, IE8 mode shows the NaN
[15:48:31] <Pinkamena_D> so did you think I coded incorrectly, or I should report that as a bug?
[15:50:29] <Bothering> Pinkamena_D: bad coding
[15:50:34] <Bothering> lool
[15:51:33] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: it works ok without the pre-defined value/min
[15:53:49] <Pinkamena_D> bothering, did you find an area where I have screwed up?
[15:54:14] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: i'd say it's a bug with the polyfill
[15:54:27] <Pinkamena_D> shoky, If some features which the github page suggests do not work, I will have to report them
[15:58:39] <charas> I suck at jquery and I am trying to create multi-step form which initiates when user clicks on the orange button at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2986690/test/index.html#
[15:58:48] <charas> Can someone suggest best way to do it
[15:59:01] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: oh
[15:59:27] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: i think you need to put seconds too, in the value/min
[16:00:42] <Pinkamena_D> actually, I just took a look at the demo page on their github in ie8 and most of the boxed display the NaN errors
[16:01:00] <Pinkamena_D> maybe they did not want to support it
[16:01:45] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: if you put seconds in, it works
[16:03:45] <toter> Hi everybodyâ€¦ On the website http://thiagomorais.hcm.com.br, i'm using spin.js. It is loading the spinner just fine, but I can't make it disappear once the page is loaded. Could someone help me?
[16:04:28] <toter> At the bottom of the page, I added $('#spin').data('spinner').stop();
[16:04:34] <toter> But it is not stopping the spinner
[16:09:56] <shoky> Pinkamena_D: but yeah that's also a bug, they're using != null  to test for an empty string
[16:11:43] <__machine> i have some code inside $(function() { ... }); ... it creates a few hundred img elements, adds them to the dom and positions them... that takes a few seconds and nothing is rendered on the page until it is completed... why? shouldnt the page appear first before the on ready function is called?
[16:11:52] <devslash> im trying to implement this calendar on my site: http://www.web-delicious.com/jquery-plugins-demo/wdCalendar/sample.php. i want to capture the event when the user clicks on the calendar and prevent a new event from being added. ive done debugging and have the event $("#dvCalMain").click(function(event) but i cant prevent the purple box and bubble from appearing when you drag your mouse own on
[16:11:52] <devslash> the calendar
[16:25:31] <shoky> devslash: you can't do it without editing the hell out of that plugin
[16:31:23] <__machine> shoky: sorry i asked a question you answered last night but i was afk... the loop takes about 2-3 seconds to complete... but the problem is i just see a white page during that time and then i see everything appear... i want to see the page first... then progressively add elements so its not so jarring for users...
[16:42:38] <RandalSchwartz> yeay - got my custom tabs derivative working
[16:45:20] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://jsbin.com/olisix/2/
[16:45:55] <RandalSchwartz> internal links automatically change the tab
[16:46:12] <RandalSchwartz> and also highlight the tab on hover
[16:54:42] <shoky> good jerb RandalSchwartz
[16:54:50] <shoky> __machine: got a link?
[16:57:20] <Eviltwin> RandalSchwartz: One thing I did in my custom tabs was make it so you could navigate to nested tabs easily
[16:57:38] <Eviltwin> i.e. if you hit an anchor for a tab that was currently obscured inside another set of tabs
[16:57:45] <Eviltwin> It would reveal the appropriate tab
[16:57:57] <Eviltwin> Pretty simple with event bubbling
[17:02:11] <samsoft> hello house, please can someone help me how i can load select dynamically with form
[17:02:41] <Eviltwin> I don't understand what half of that question means
[17:04:11] <samsoft> oh okay.. EvilTwin
[17:04:30] <samsoft> want to load those option dynamically... not typing it
[17:05:20] <Eviltwin> Okay, do you have some server-side code to give you the options?
[17:05:34] <Radar> I have an API endpoint returning a JSON hash and a 422 status when I make a request to it that is invalid. In my $.ajax's error handler I can't seem to gain access to this object, like this: https://gist.github.com/radar/5810639. How do I gain access to that object?
[17:05:46] <Radar> data is returning an xhr object instead
[17:07:07] <Eviltwin> You sure? the XHR should be the third argument
[17:07:12] <samsoft> No, not yet.. thinking of what to use..
[17:07:46] <samsoft> i have use javascript but is not working out
[17:07:58] <Radar> Eviltwin: I get back Object {readyState: 4, getResponseHeader: ...
[17:08:10] <shoky> Radar:  error
[17:08:10] <shoky> Type: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[17:08:12] <Radar> Eviltwin: I expect the actual content from the request.
[17:08:22] <Radar> Like success.
[17:08:39] <shoky> Radar: check the docs
[17:09:04] <Radar> shoky: I have been. I want clarification.
[17:09:23] <Eviltwin> Radar: I'd suggest changing your console.log(data) in the success to be console.log("success: ", data)
[17:09:32] <Eviltwin> And your console.log in the error to be console.log("error: ", data)
[17:09:39] <samsoft> Eviltwin
[17:09:39] <Eviltwin> To make sure you're seeing the right thing in the right place
[17:09:43] <Radar> Eviltwin: Thank you but I am pretty sure it's the error that's coming through. I can see the responses on the server.
[17:09:50] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ samsoft
[17:09:51] <b-ot> samsoft: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:09:51] <bot-t> samsoft, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:10:09] <Eviltwin> ...
[17:10:13] <Eviltwin> Radar: Did you read the signature for error?
[17:10:14] <shoky> Radar: jqXHR.responseText is the response
[17:10:18] <Eviltwin> It's different
[17:10:32] <shoky> you can JSON.parse it if it's json and you want an object
[17:10:33] <Radar> shoky: Do I need to JSON.parse that to get it into an object I can work with?
[17:10:36] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:10:36] <shoky> ;p
[17:10:40] <Radar> Ok then. That's what I wanted clarification on.
[17:10:59] <Eviltwin> Because it's an error, there's no guarantee it's actually going to be json
[17:11:12] <Eviltwin> It might be an error from your load balancer or something
[17:11:20] <Eviltwin> So it doesn't make an attempt to parse it as any particular type
[17:12:21] <Radar> Thank you for your time.
[17:15:00] <samsoft> EvilTwin: http://jsfiddle.net/VyfY6/
[17:15:09] <samsoft> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/VyfY6/
[17:15:44] <shoky> we both get the same link? :(
[17:16:07] <shoky> samsoft: wtf is  title = title['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Miss'];
[17:16:09] <shoky> :P
[17:16:42] <shoky> samsoft:  document.getElementById('#select');   that looks for id="#select"
[17:16:47] <shoky> samsoft: you dont even have id="select"  :P
[17:16:49] <Eviltwin> I forget, is this the guy who refused to learn JavaScript after we told him multiple times to do so
[17:17:02] <shoky> adunno
[17:17:11] <samsoft> laugh at me.... haahahaa...
[17:17:16] <samsoft> no, i am not the guy...
[17:17:33] <samsoft> trying to learn Sirs
[17:17:53] <Eviltwin> I think it was alleZSoyez I got in a heated argument with
[17:18:21] <Eviltwin> Or maybe Draxelis
[17:18:35] <shoky> samsoft: http://jsfiddle.net/VyfY6/1/
[17:19:23] <shoky> assuming you're using jquery..
[17:20:25] <samsoft> thank you guy... i appreciate..
[17:20:29] <Eviltwin> Or if like me you hate variables: http://jsfiddle.net/VyfY6/2/
[17:20:59] <rainabba> I was trying to find all descendants of a dom element and realized that script elements were being returned (with .outerHeight() > 0 if you can imagine) and so I need to filter those out. I expected the following to do that but it does not. Where have I gone wrong?  o.find('*').not('script')
[17:21:03] <shoky> yep but that's harder to understand for beginners
[17:22:35] <shoky> rainabba: that should filter out any script elements, i think.. jsfiddle/demo plz
[17:27:23] <rainabba> This assumes that chaining .find() works as I expect (though that's just for the demo and I'm not using it in my code): http://jsfiddle.net/BAZfm/
[17:27:34] <rainabba> shoky
[17:29:41] <shoky> rainabba: uhh you're doing .find('script') AFTER the .not  ..
[17:30:12] <shoky> rainabba: so it finds the scripts inside non-script elements
[17:31:04] <shoky> rainabba: i think you meant .filter('script') instad of .find('script')  ?
[17:31:20] <shoky> rainabba: http://jsfiddle.net/BAZfm/1/
[17:31:35] <rainabba> Hence my point about the chaining. If not() removes elements, the .find() shouldn't have access to them right? Anyway, in my code I'm not using the .find(). That's just to give you a pretty console output.
[17:32:01] <shoky> not() removes scripts, so you're left with some non-script elements
[17:32:17] <shoky> then you run .find('script') on those elements so it finds all scripts inside the non-script elements
[17:32:26] <rainabba> This is my literal code (won't run there of course): http://jsfiddle.net/BAZfm/2/
[17:32:26] <shoky> you didn't have any point about the chaining.
[17:33:13] <shoky> rainabba: and what's the problem?
[17:33:27] <rainabba> I'm getting script elements inside the each() call
[17:33:39] <shoky> that's what i asked for a demo of.
[17:33:56] <shoky> otherwise, you're lying ;P
[17:37:25] <rainabba> :)\
[17:37:33] <rainabba> I was lying
[17:37:41] <shoky> teehee
[17:37:42] <rainabba> Confusing two functions
[17:37:45] <rainabba> ty
[17:37:50] <shoky> np
[17:38:03] <rainabba> Half the power of IRC is being forced to explain a problem. You're the other half ;)
[17:38:20] <shoky> ;]
[18:22:02] <Bustacap> Can someone help me getting my jquery script to work properly please? http://jsbin.com/amuvuc
[18:29:32] <sc_> Bustacap: how much $$$ u got?
[18:47:18] <shoky> Bustacap: you need to event.preventDefault()  on the event argument
[18:48:08] <shoky> Bustacap: http://jsbin.com/amuvuc/5
[18:51:55] <sc_> shoky: you're too nice
[18:53:14] <shoky> sc_: problem?
[18:53:26] <sc_> negative
[18:54:03] <deckTrout> hi
[18:54:04] <deckTrout> guys
[18:54:09] <deckTrout> i got a question
[18:54:48] <deckTrout> i added some dom to input and i again want to add some dom to dom which is added with jquery,
[18:54:50] <deckTrout> is it possible?
[18:55:11] <sc_> sounds good, in theory
[18:55:11] <deckTrout> so
[18:55:12] <shoky> dom is dom
[18:55:18] <deckTrout> put short,
[18:55:36] <deckTrout> dom added by jquery can be added to again by jquery?
[18:55:44] <sc_> sure
[18:55:56] <sc_> i use live for that
[18:56:01] <sc_> sometimes...
[18:56:20] <deckTrout> can u show me codes?
[18:56:22] <shoky> that has nothing to do with his q.. and live is deprecated/removed
[18:56:28] <deckTrout> like best tutorial about that or so heh
[18:56:29] <sc_> :L
[18:56:50] <sc_> i just FAILED
[18:58:25] <sc_> so now i have to go back and replace all my live items with on
[18:58:38] <sc_> once we go to 1.9 in our framework
[18:58:40] <sc_> great
[18:59:02] <shoky> hope you don't just replace "live" with "on"
[18:59:22] <sc_> yea nice syntax
[18:59:50] <sc_> i don't even remember where that is implemented, it has been so many implementations
[19:04:55] <deckTrout> so there's no solution for my question?
[19:05:12] <frenocha> I have a <a href="#home">go back</a> with a $("a").on("click", and i'm wondering how I can return "home" inside the event
[19:05:16] <Eviltwin> deckTrout: Your question was not understood by me
[19:05:17] <shoky> deckTrout: you just add to the dom as usual
[19:05:33] <deckTrout> ok
[19:05:40] <Eviltwin> frenocha: What does that mean?
[19:05:52] <deckTrout> but already added dom could be again added to with dom by jquery?
[19:05:54] <Bustacap> EvilEmpire, I was wondering the same thing o.O
[19:06:06] <shoky> deckTrout: YES
[19:06:08] <Eviltwin> deckTrout: Yes, elements can be added to the DOM by jQuery
[19:06:29] <Eviltwin> deckTrout: Please read this document: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/traversing-manipulating
[19:06:31] <deckTrout> hmm
[19:06:35] <frenocha> Eviltwin, $(this).text() gives me "go back", but I want to return "home" (the href)
[19:06:37] <deckTrout> thanks
[19:07:07] <RandalSchwartz> $(this).attr('href')
[19:07:07] <Eviltwin> frenocha: Try .attr("href")
[19:08:42] <frenocha> Eviltwin, that does the trick, ty
[19:09:09] <sc_> +@RandalSchwartz
[19:09:55] <RandalSchwartz> I extended $.ui.tabs today!
[19:10:20] <RandalSchwartz> and even overrode _create, and called the super version :)
[19:12:51] <sc_> nice
[19:14:40] <RandalSchwartz> enabled <a href="#tab-3">foo</a> within tab 2 to go to tab 3
[19:14:46] <RandalSchwartz> even with hover coloring
[19:15:47] <RandalSchwartz> here it is live: click "schedule" on http://insightcruises.com/events/sa21_event.html
[19:15:52] <RandalSchwartz> and then mouse-over the links
[19:16:01] <RandalSchwartz> those are "internal" links, pointing at other tabs
[19:17:03] <RandalSchwartz> that should be part of the core... I find it very useful
[19:17:30] <RandalSchwartz> I suppose I could join the jqueryui mailing list :)
[19:32:17] <Bustacap> Can someone tell me what's wrong with this that after a few clicks back and forth it bugs out: http://jsbin.com/amuvuc/2/
[19:34:47] <RandalSchwartz> the code is not symmetric
[19:34:55] <RandalSchwartz> that's a sign that something isn't being set/cleared properly
[19:35:01] <RandalSchwartz> why $other.lenght > 0?
[19:35:10] <RandalSchwartz> you don't have it in the other version
[19:35:32] <Bustacap> I have no idea. I pulled both scripts from different sites, and they looked almost identical lol.
[19:35:32] <RandalSchwartz> do you have more than one id="slider"?
[19:35:46] <Bustacap> Nope, just the one called slider
[19:35:47] <RandalSchwartz> oh - so you're just randomly copy-pasting, and want us to debug?
[19:35:57] <Bustacap> Nah, I've been trying to get it to work myself all day.
[19:36:12] <RandalSchwartz> you should write the code you want then
[19:36:22] <RandalSchwartz> if you don't understand every line of that, ask, or rewrite it
[19:36:58] <Bustacap> I would imagine there is an easier way to do it. Those seem long for no reason.
[19:37:03] <RandalSchwartz> it's never productive for me to debug code that the author doesn't understan
[19:37:56] <RandalSchwartz> it looks like you're reproducing the jquery tabs plugin, sorta
[19:37:57] <Bustacap> I understand what each line does.
[19:38:32] <Bustacap> This is the original that I'm basing it off of: http://jsfiddle.net/sg3s/RZpbK/
[19:39:40] <Bustacap> I'm just having trouble getting it to go both ways kinda like a slideshow would do.
[19:41:05] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/web-development/jquery-slideshow/
[19:41:26] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://www.slidesjs.com
[19:42:00] <Bustacap> But does that just put images in a list and do it like that, or does it base it on div's so I can add content too?
[19:42:28] <RandalSchwartz> dude... you're not paying me enough to even google it for you. :)
[19:42:31] <Bustacap> All of the other slider's I've been trying have been a pain in the ass trying to get to the size I have it at.
[19:42:32] <RandalSchwartz> get good at teh googles
[19:42:37] <RandalSchwartz> slideshows are a dime a dozen
[19:42:39] <RandalSchwartz> go research
[19:42:43] <Bustacap> I have
[19:42:51] <Bustacap> I don't ask questions unless I've researched for a day already.
[19:43:24] <Bustacap> Height: 80% and width 100% margin-top: 10% seems to break every slideshow I've tried.
[19:52:03] <shoky> Bustacap: did you not see my answer before?
[19:53:24] <shoky> <shoky> Bustacap: you need to event.preventDefault()  on the event argument  <shoky> Bustacap: http://jsbin.com/amuvuc/5
[19:59:45] <Bustacap> shoky, I did not.
[19:59:51] <Bustacap> But you fixed it!
[19:59:57] <Bustacap> Now I gotta see how so I remember.
[20:00:38] <shoky> Bustacap: event.preventDefault() is the important bit. other than that i just changed the slide direction to be normal
[20:01:35] <shoky> Bustacap: oh, well and i removed the 'right' css/animation. cause that would fuck up if you have both left and right
[20:01:44] <shoky> and there was no need for 'right' specifically
[20:01:53] <Bustacap> Yeah, I was wondering why it was all left's now.
[20:02:03] <Bustacap> I mean if it works, then it's how I need to learn.
[20:02:18] <Bustacap> How did you change the duration?
[20:02:23] <shoky> if you have both left and right, then left takes precedence
[20:02:26] <shoky> i didn't change the duration
[20:02:40] <Bustacap> Oh
[20:02:46] <Bustacap> I misread.
[20:02:51] <Bustacap> "other than that i just changed the slide direction to be normal"
[20:02:57] <Bustacap> I thought you said duration not direction
[20:02:58] <Bustacap> Lol
[20:03:03] <shoky> ;p
[20:03:16] <Bustacap> I need to google that event.preventdefault thing
[20:03:46] <shoky> it prevents the default action of clicking a link
[20:03:52] <Bustacap> Ohhhhhhhhhh
[20:04:00] <Bustacap> That would make a lot of sense then why it should be there.
[20:04:17] <shoky> but yeah, read about it for sure
[20:07:03] <Bustacap> Well thanks a lot for your help :)
[20:07:11] <shoky> np
[20:07:22] <Bustacap> You're the only person to try and not just yell at me telling me to google.
[20:11:03] <RandalSchwartz> That's because he's smarter than me. :)
[20:12:44] <shoky> i'm sure you could do it better than me in perl ;]
[20:14:15] <RandalSchwartz> I would hope so. :)
[20:14:31] <RandalSchwartz> as the alpha dog in Perl... I should have *some* skills. :)
[20:14:38] <xyxne> manners*
[20:14:44] <shoky> ;)
[20:15:25] <RandalSchwartz> sadly, as cool as jquery is, I'll be doing my next project in Dart, so no need for jquery
[20:15:27] <xyxne> flippantly telling people to google things you don't want to help with has far less to do with skill than it does respect.
[20:15:57] <RandalSchwartz> or it's the most expedient way to get them an answer when you don't have it
[20:16:10] <RandalSchwartz> consider that
[20:16:12] <xyxne> "sorry, I don't know"
[20:16:21] <xyxne> nope, not the most expedient.
[20:16:34] <RandalSchwartz> we will have to agree to disagree
[20:16:41] <RandalSchwartz> I suspect I'm 30 years your senior too
[20:17:00] <xyxne> now you're going to pretend that age is relevant too?
[20:17:07] <RandalSchwartz> and that confirms it :)
[20:17:24] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - the arrogance of youth
[20:17:25] <Eviltwin> Whoa, someone's claiming to be the resident alpha dog in Perl?
[20:17:37] <RandalSchwartz> I had it once
[20:17:39] <RandalSchwartz> finally grew out of it
[20:17:50] <Eviltwin> I used to code almost everything in Perl
[20:17:54] <xyxne> the ironly of you trying to label me as 'arrogant' for calling you out on being disrespectful toward people asking for help.
[20:17:56] <RandalSchwartz> I still do
[20:18:03] <xyxne> irony*
[20:18:05] <snover> telling people to google something is not being unhelpful, it is forcing people to act responsibly and experience the pain of finding and learning something instead of having it given to them for free, where they learn nothing except that they donâ€™t have to do anything
[20:18:08] <Eviltwin> I still do quite a bit of Perl
[20:18:14] <Eviltwin> But I have diversified a lot
[20:18:37] <RandalSchwartz> my current client serves 2 billion hits a day from a rack of 120 24-core servers.  all using mod_perl
[20:18:54] <snover> itâ€™s like asking your professor to just give you all the answers to the test because reading the coursework is difficult
[20:18:59] <shoky> i'll never get used to autovivification
[20:19:08] <RandalSchwartz> yeah autoviv is a bit bizarre
[20:19:14] <RandalSchwartz> but then I miss it in other languages
[20:19:39] <Eviltwin> I think saying just "Google it" isn't super helpful. It's definitely something they should have done.
[20:19:58] <Eviltwin> But not everyone has the skills to use the right search terms
[20:20:01] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - but I sensed a bit of that not yet being done effecitvely
[20:20:02] <Eviltwin> Or to sift through the results
[20:20:05] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - I have good google fu
[20:20:17] <RandalSchwartz> for example, being careful to add "past year" to queries
[20:20:22] <RandalSchwartz> especially about jquery
[20:20:24] <Eviltwin> What I will do routinely is force people to read a bunch of docs
[20:20:33] <Eviltwin> Like I could point them right to a specific passage
[20:20:40] <Eviltwin> But if they're going to be using a function like $.ajax
[20:20:44] <shoky> g'night sirs
[20:20:45] <Eviltwin> They should probably have read the whole page
[20:20:54] <snover> i find it is generally possible to tell who actually bothered to try to search first and who didnâ€™t
[20:21:06] <snover> and, like god, will help those who help themselves
[20:21:08] <RandalSchwartz> I suspect I mostly can as well
[20:21:29] <RandalSchwartz> over the years of helping people, I have developed a bunch of "teach them to fish" strategies
[20:21:41] <Eviltwin> I usually give people one freebie
[20:21:49] <Eviltwin> If I don't recognize the nick / name / host
[20:21:59] <RandalSchwartz> "give a man a fire... he's warm for an hour.  set a man on fire, he's warm for the rest of his life!"
[20:22:00] <Eviltwin> I'll try to help them out if it's something reasonably small
[20:22:17] <Eviltwin> If they keep on going then I start to push them to do more themselves
[20:22:58] <RandalSchwartz> my pain with Bustacap was that it was just "here, FIX THIS!"
[20:23:06] <RandalSchwartz> no questions, just code spew
[20:23:15] <RandalSchwartz> that usually means they don't understand what they copy-pasta'ed
[20:23:30] <RandalSchwartz> and probably hadn't spent much time debugging
[20:23:45] <RandalSchwartz> seen it many times before
[20:24:08] <RandalSchwartz> I don't mind teaching programmers.  but I refuse to code for end users.
[20:24:19] <snover> apparently you are a terrible person
[20:24:23] <RandalSchwartz> apparently!
[20:25:12] <RandalSchwartz> that's why jresig was so horrified when I interviewed him for FLOSS Weekly :)
[20:25:23] <xyxne> rwaldron, if I were a snake I could have bitten you
[20:25:30] <rwaldron> sneak
[20:25:35] <rwaldron> what's the problem?
[20:35:45] <Eviltwin> So what brings you to #jquery, RandalSchwartz?
[20:44:43] <Eviltwin> Ugh, I think I'm trying to be too clever with this project
[20:45:39] <RandalSchwartz> Oops.. missed earlier.  After interviewing jresig, I started lookig at that
[20:45:48] <RandalSchwartz> gave up my use of YUI, moved to jquery for everything
[20:46:09] <RandalSchwartz> of course, now with Dart upcoming, won't need much jq
[20:49:16] <Bustacap> o.O
[20:50:17] <Bustacap> RandalSchwartz, I've been working on this stupid thing all day trying to figure out what shoky did in like 10 seconds. Like I said, JS and I don't usually get along, but I always try for hours to figure something out before I ask. I feel like I achieve more if I figure it out myself.
[20:50:44] <Bustacap> I was just so frustrated at the time of asking here that I can understand why it would come off that way.
[20:52:38] <Bustacap> Oh noes! The internets is breaking!
[20:53:20] <Bustacap> Don't worry, I fixed it.
[21:01:02] <vladikoff> Bustacap, happy to see that you worked it out :) don't be afraid to ask questions here
[21:02:34] <Bustacap> vladikoff, It was shoky, not me. But I'm learning. That's what I'm here for.
[21:03:04] <Bustacap> Me and js/jq will be friends one day. We've been enemies for a while :P
[21:03:09] <vladikoff> Bustacap, :)
[21:04:06] <Bustacap> o.O
[21:22:29] <ztt_> must jq mobile run in a server?
[21:23:40] <ztt_> jQuery let me view this http://localhost/test-jquery/index2.html&ui-page=users
[21:24:07] <ztt_> But I just want to run the script on file:///D:/xampp/htdocs/test-jquery/index2.html
[21:24:36] <ztt_> How to do that?
[21:49:00] <nrogers64> Hey guys, I know this is related to a jQuery plugin (flot) and not jQuery itself, but I could really use some help. If you could spare some time, please check this out. I would really appreciate it! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17128827/flot-zoom-to-far-right-by-default

[22:05:01] <Eviltwin> Using > instead should help

[23:22:44] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/fgBhT/6/

[23:22:56] <JBlitzen> Your h2 tag wasn't closed
[23:22:58] <s2013> i think its the late night
[23:23:02] <JBlitzen> You had <h2>asdf<h2>
[23:23:07] <JBlitzen> Then document.ready was wrong
[23:23:15] <JBlitzen> Maybe a few other issues
[23:23:22] <s2013> yeah
[23:23:30] <s2013> i saw that now. sorry my brain is half fried

[23:25:35] <JBlitzen> Weird

[23:25:43] <JBlitzen> Anyway
[23:25:50] <Eviltwin> Look at his ID
[23:25:55] <Eviltwin> In the element itself
[23:26:06] <s2013> http://jsfiddle.net/fgBhT/8/ how come thats not working its similar to waht you have
[23:26:10] <JBlitzen> Haha
[23:26:14] <JBlitzen> Good call
[23:26:24] <JBlitzen> Excessive #
[23:26:46] <Eviltwin> More importantly, incorrect #
[23:26:56] <JBlitzen> s2013, don't try to dump all the code out at once.  Iterate.  Start with a tiny part and get it working with a simple alert call.  Then add more.
[23:26:59] <s2013> yeah i see. man i was really out of it
[23:27:08] <s2013> ok it works now.
[23:27:51] <fella5s> sometimes i get that mistake myself (including # in id, and also including . in class)
[23:28:08] <s2013> no i know i wasnt supposed to. just had a realy long day
[23:28:08] <JBlitzen> I'm still new enough to jquery that I've never done that one
[23:28:20] <JBlitzen> But I've gone the other way and forgotten # or . in selectors
[23:28:23] <s2013> this is very basic stuff
[23:28:32] <s2013> thats why i was surprised it wasnt working
[23:28:35] <JBlitzen> Yes, we're very disappointed in you
[23:28:42] <s2013> i am disappointed in myself
[23:28:52] <JBlitzen> Haha
[23:28:54] <s2013> i guess tahts what happens when you try to code at 230 am half asleep
[23:29:44] <fella5s> i broke everything by adding logging to my code base -__-
[23:30:17] <s2013> anyone here work with rails?
[23:30:55] <fella5s> i don't work with rails but sometimes do something in my "freetime"
[23:31:31] <s2013> i have trouble understanding how to get jquery to work with rails
[23:31:38] <s2013> i mean ajax stuff
[23:33:44] <chkpnt> $("<span>1</span>").append($("<span>2</span>")) works, but $("<span>1</span>").after($("<span>2</span>")) doesn't. Am I missing something?
[23:34:44] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[23:35:10] <Eviltwin> What's the goal in the second case?
[23:35:45] <chkpnt> To get <span>1</span><span>2</span>.
[23:36:16] <Cork> chkpnt: you can't after to a fragment
[23:36:21] <Eviltwin> Actually
[23:36:29] <Eviltwin> As of jQuery 1.4...
[23:36:38] <Cork> $("<span>1</span>").add("<span>2</span>") should work though
[23:37:20] <Cork> a fragment has no parent, so you can't after/before to it
[23:37:58] <Eviltwin> Then I think the docs need to be updated
[23:38:18] <Cork> if i remember correctly it changed in 1.8 or somewhere like that
[23:38:24] <Eviltwin> $(a).after(b) could simply return $(a).add(b)
[23:38:42] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[23:38:45] <Cork> for a fragment yes, but it isn't the same for in dom
[23:39:17] <Eviltwin> Yes, I meant for a fragment
[23:40:02] <Cork> not sure why the framework should have special case in the common after code path when the user knows they arn't working with an element in the page
[23:40:18] <Eviltwin> Yeah, true
[23:40:25] <Eviltwin> I see it in the 1.7 source but it's gone now
[23:44:30] <chkpnt> Maybe, I should concat first and then call $(...)
[23:44:49] <chkpnt> Other topic: should $("div", $("<div></div>")).html("<span>1</span>") work?
[23:45:23] <chkpnt> Because I'm just getting a weired object
[23:45:56] <chkpnt> (I
[23:46:00] <Eviltwin> Uh....
[23:46:04] <Eviltwin> No you should not
[23:47:40] <chkpnt> I've got several html-fragments which I want to use to define some "templates". But those should be hold in variables first, so I can't work directly on the DOM.
[23:49:22] <chkpnt> something like var container = "<div></div>", frag1 = "<span>1</span>", frag2 = "<span>2</span>" ... And I want template = "<div><span>1</span><span>2</span></div>"
[23:50:02] <Eviltwin> $(container).append(frag1).append(frag2)?
[23:52:20] <Xgear> I have a slight issue. I have two ajax calls made when submitting a form, both on different parts of the code (One trigger on submit and the other one triggers on click for the specified button.
[23:52:35] <Xgear> However the button request is being made before the form request
[23:52:48] <Xgear> Is there anyway in which I could specify I need the form to be sent before the button?
