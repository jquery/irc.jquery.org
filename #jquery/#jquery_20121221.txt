[00:00:57] <trinadh> lasha: 568px, is that what you were looking for
[00:01:35] <lasha> speak of the devil. i JUST came across that haha
[00:01:38] <lasha> thank you! :)
[00:02:26] <trinadh> lasha: welcome
[00:32:43] <quijote> Anyone feel liek helping out a newbie?
[00:35:55] <BuriB> I do. :) good morning exercise instead of coffee!
[00:36:56] <quijote> BuriB, are you saying you cna help me?
[00:37:09] <BuriB> yes.
[00:37:13] <quijote> cool thanks
[00:37:14] <quijote> I have a ul.level1 li ul.level2 li structure setup. I have a function that get executed when somone clicks on the ul.level1 li and another for when someone clicks on ul.level2 li. However when I click on ul.level2 it also executes ul.level1 li
[00:37:41] <BuriB> it's because javascript event delegation.
[00:38:03] <BuriB> when u click on the level2 li, the event bubbles up in the dom tree
[00:38:10] <quijote> i figured
[00:38:13] <BuriB> so u have to stop the propagation
[00:38:14] <quijote> how do i stop this
[00:38:18] <quijote> yes
[00:38:26] <BuriB> by calling stopPropagation() on the event
[00:38:45] <quijote> let me look this up in jquery
[00:38:58] <BuriB> so if u have someting like $('.level2').on('click', function( e ) { e.stopPropagation(); } )
[00:39:00] <quijote> do you call it within the function?
[00:39:07] <quijote> nice
[00:39:28] <BuriB> or instead of on u can use bind
[00:39:34] <BuriB> depends on what version u have
[00:39:37] <BuriB> next question? :)
[00:40:01] <quijote> world not ending ? XP
[00:40:19] <BuriB> in 2 hours 30 minutes 40 secods
[00:41:40] <quijote> What do you mean by bind? i thought $('selector').html() was a form of binding?
[00:42:47] <BuriB> $('.level2').bind('eventName', handlerFunction_);
[00:43:02] <quijote> ahh i see
[00:43:06] <quijote> thank you much
[00:43:07] <BuriB> by bind I mean using jquery bind() method to register an eventHandler
[00:43:13] <quijote> ok
[00:43:45] <BuriB> if u are using latest version, just go with 'on'
[00:44:22] <quijote> on?
[00:44:50] <BuriB> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:45:34] <quijote> thank you again
[00:54:29] <mazzachre> Can I somehow make jqueryui datepicker hide the day selection (so it becomes a month picker) without resorting to generally hiding the ui-datepicker-calendar class?
[01:00:46] <BuriB> mazzachre how about changing the background color of the selected day in css so every day will look the same?
[01:01:12] <fabioportieri> how to group dinamically created links togheter with colorbox?
[01:03:00] <fabioportieri> http://pastie.org/5560622
[01:04:51] <fabioportieri> any help is appreciated
[01:05:10] <BuriB> fabioportieri: you can group items into group by giving the same value to the items' rel attribute.
[01:05:22] <fabioportieri> i tried but it doesn't work
[01:05:36] <BuriB> you've wrote  rel:'imageCboxHandler' but u haven't actually give the imageCboxHandler
[01:06:02] <fabioportieri> not in that code but i tried,, trying again..
[01:06:09] <BuriB> think it should be <img src="/public/fotogallery/<%=rs("foto")%>" class="large_image" rel="rel:'imageCboxHandler'}" />
[01:06:40] <fabioportieri> rel="rel: ?
[01:07:03] <BuriB> ohh sry. just simple rel="galleryGroupName"
[01:07:15] <fabioportieri> just tried.. doesn't work to me
[01:07:42] <BuriB> can u give us a jsfiddle link where all the necessary css, js files are included?
[01:07:51] <BuriB> it's easier to check.
[01:08:16] <fabioportieri> ohh i managed
[01:08:19] <BuriB> http://jsfiddle.net/
[01:08:20] <fabioportieri> to get it work
[01:08:29] <fabioportieri> thanks for the support BuriB
[01:08:40] <BuriB> welcome.
[01:08:44] <fabioportieri> :)
[01:34:50] <Elium-> hello, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13987518/wordpress-widget-jquery-live-or-on-admin-side  , if anyone has an idea :)
[01:42:34] <fabioportieri> difficult to tell, without code
[01:43:24] <BuriB> Elium: if you type on jQuery.on into console
[01:43:42] <BuriB> do you get undefined ?
[01:44:15] <xec> jQuery.fn.on *
[01:44:39] <xec> or: jQuery.fn.jquery to see version number
[01:46:06] <BuriB> it might happend that your jquery gets overwritten. that's why it's worth to check out either the version of your jquery or if the 'on' function is defined
[01:46:08] <BuriB> both works.
[01:46:18] <BuriB> *happen
[01:46:31] <xec> jQuery.on will always be undefined though ;)
[01:47:54] <BuriB> ahh yes. my mistake. xec is right.
[01:54:22] <mazzachre> Why don't I get a "moo" out of this? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/BVbZT/
[01:55:05] <aquatix> *boom*
[01:59:49] <xec> mazzachre: i'm not sure, but likely the jquery UI click handler either does preventDefault or return false
[02:00:15] <xec> s/preventDefault/stopPropagation
[02:00:55] <xec> mazzachre: this line, perhaps? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L230
[02:00:59] <mazzachre> xec: I can make it work, by attaching directly to the item with a setTimeout delay?
[02:01:23] <xec> mazzachre: why setTimeout? why not just do it after the .datepicker() call
[02:01:56] <xec> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/BVbZT/1/
[02:02:33] <mazzachre> Hmm... I tried that in my own application, but the resulting jquery object was empty...
[02:04:16] <mazzachre> OOOoohhh... Damned, Now I found my original error... thx xec :)
[02:04:35] <xec> hehe, yw - what was the error if you don't mind me asking?
[02:05:08] <mazzachre> xec: That the programmer I have taken over from on this project is clinically insane :p Well, it was a scope error...
[02:05:16] <xec> hahah
[02:06:02] <Elium-> xec thanks for your answer :) sorry for multiple editing on stackoverflow, I tried to ident my code on comment
[02:06:06] <mazzachre> xec: I mean it... I got more global functions and implied global values in this thing than I have seen in the "do not do this" textbook examples back when in school..
[02:07:13] <xec> mazzachre: i feel your pain. at least you're going to get a good eye for mistakes with all these error spotting exercises :D
[02:07:58] <BuriB> or better yet, introduce jslint or jshint :)
[02:08:12] <martisj> anybody used adam shaw's fullcalendar.js ?
[02:08:19] <martisj> and styled it to their liking?
[02:08:21] <xec> yeah that's a good idea too. BuriB++
[02:08:58] <xec> Elium-: on SO you can edit your question, code in comments gets really messy
[02:09:21] <Elium-> yes sorry I'm doing it, sorry about that
[02:09:30] <mazzachre> I have run a lint on some of these pages... the output made me cry :)
[02:11:27] <BuriB> worth to fix them, this will most likely save a lot of times on bugfixing when testers / client starts to find the hidden bugs.
[02:11:58] <mazzachre> xec: Well, I have done the sensible thing at some pages, simply rewritten them from scratch and then spent some time adding some of the bugs back, because the users demanded it... sigh
[02:12:12] <mazzachre> At least now the bugs are coded nicely and documented...
[02:13:03] <xec> lol, users demanded their beloved bugs back? that's crazy
[02:13:50] <BuriB> its not a bug, it's a feature :)
[02:14:25] <xec> lunchtime! bbl
[02:15:06] <mazzachre> Well, one form, that uses date fields, had a validation to only allow dates in the future, but if you manually typed the date instead of selecting it, the validation did nothing, so when I did it correctly and the field validated anyway the users cried, because they were used to be able to backdate something...
[02:36:44] <mkoks> Doesnt async:false mean that $.ajax should be submiting like a form? (move to the url page? )
[02:37:04] <granden> Hi, trying to publish an app to the store, or at least get it ready for review.
[02:37:08] <mkoks> I mean like a simple html form
[02:37:14] <granden> But when trying to send in my ap it says it cant find any
[02:37:16] <granden> in xcode.
[02:37:24] <babl_wrk> Happy Doomsday today!
[02:37:34] <granden> My Bundle ID is the same, do I need to enter the SKU number somewhere in xCode?
[02:39:59] <evaluate> Hello.
[02:40:25] <mkoks> babl_wrk You too. But.. nothing is happening right now. Maybe this regions doesnt have world end app.
[02:40:30] <evaluate> Are there any example on how I should echo back data from a php script to a jquery ajax call, so that jquery can interpret it as an array for example?
[02:41:01] <trinadh> mkoks: async:false means , the javascript code after the call should run after the ajax call is finished, i.e synchronously
[02:41:14] <granden> Is the appstore closed now for new submissions of apps?
[02:41:22] <BuriB> mkoks: async false means that browser will hang till the ajax returns
[02:41:29] <BuriB> u should not set that to false.
[02:41:52] <BuriB> what is your goal ?
[02:44:16] <mkoks> BuriB I have php which is generating pdf, I want to send data from another php to the generator and then return pdf file to the sender php.
[02:44:35] <mkoks> I have no idea how to do that
[02:45:01] <mkoks> evaluate do you know about json ?
[02:45:34] <evaluate> mkoks, yeah, just found that using google. I think that's my answer… Thanks!
[02:46:24] <BuriB> mkoks: and what the problem?
[02:46:31] <BuriB> mkoks: and whats the problem?
[02:55:14] <fabioportieri> i have a weird issue with colorbox: it popups fine when a link is clicked, on a group, but always displays as "image 29 of 29" even if i click first image.. how to fix it?
[02:55:17] <mkoks> BuriB Well, maybe thats not the js/jquery related question at all but maybe it is. Problem is as I already said - I dont know how to accomplish what I need.
[02:56:56] <mkoks> pdf generator php shows pdf when it gets the data but how can I make $.ajax understand that on success it should return the pdf?
[02:57:08] <mkoks> like to start downloading it.
[03:00:46] <faraway> mkoks: well .. there are different solutions, you can start the pdf generation with the ajax call, and then when pdf is generated in php save it with some unique name, return the path to the pdf from this script as json response and then trigger the download with window.location = linktopdf; or genearte a download link with the url.
[03:04:31] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm having issues with pushstate. I've been reading a lot, but i'm not sure i get it. I have this site, that pushState on ajaxLoad, and that ajaxLoad onpopstate
[03:04:34] <walidvb> however, it won't really pop more than one state. as in, you can only click 'back' once. also, it doesn't let you 'forward' anymore.
[03:04:47] <walidvb> the easiest to reproduce is to visit  http://moijconnais.com
[03:05:06] <walidvb> and click more or less whatever link
[03:05:13] <walidvb> then try to click back
[03:06:15] <dwarder> in safari, how do i see ajax requests?
[03:06:20] <dwarder> as in firebug for google chrome
[03:06:23] <mkoks> faraway thanks
[03:11:21] <NivenHuH> how do you prevent vertical content from scrolling in jquery mobile?
[03:11:34] <NivenHuH> google has not been kind :( most of the stuff is for really old versions
[03:15:48] <fabioportieri> any help with colorbox? how do i change the caption "image x of y" ? it's bugged to me, whatever link i click is always displaying "image 29 of 29" even if i click first or second image
[03:16:35] <walidvb> ?colorbox
[03:16:51] <walidvb> check the api, there's an option for that
[03:18:38] <fabioportieri> uhm can't find it here: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox
[03:19:11] <evaluate> How exactly does jquery send the data to my ajax url if I use 'dataType: "json"'? It seems that both $_GET and $_POST are empty...
[03:21:15] <evaluate> Ohh, nvm, I set 'type: "json"' too :-\
[03:27:06] <fabioportieri> wtf
[03:28:27] <walidvb> fabioportieri: current 	"image {current} of {total}" 	Text or HTML for the group counter while viewing a group. {current} and {total} are detected and replaced with actual numbers while ColorBox runs.
[03:29:19] <fabioportieri> walidvb: yes, my issue is the values are messed up in my case
[03:29:38] <fabioportieri> it always starts as image total of total
[03:31:03] <fabioportieri> probably i mess up the colorbox instantiation
[03:32:34] <fabioportieri> how can i avoid that caption to be displayed?
[03:36:53] <fabioportieri> ok, figured it out: {current:''} :p
[03:37:10] <fabioportieri> it pisses me off tho
[03:42:21] <fabioportieri> bhetter yet $.fn.colorbox.settings.current = '';
[03:56:10] <walidvb> fabioportieri: smth like that :)
[04:01:43] <dsavi> I have the classic problem of getting data from a callback to a parent function, problem is the object that gets the data is dynamically instantiated so not globally accessible
[04:01:57] <dsavi> is there a way to get the data from the callback without polluting the global namespace?
[04:04:30] <dsavi> For example, if there's some way I could make it do function.call(myParentObject, callbackdata)
[04:09:14] <db42> any reason for an <audio src="blah" id="blah"> html element, and $('#blah').play() not to play the sound ?
[04:11:53] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm having issues with pushstate. I've been reading a lot, but i'm not sure i get it. I have this site, that pushState on ajaxLoad, and that ajaxLoad onpopstate
[04:12:00] <walidvb> however, it won't really pop more than one state. as in, you can only click 'back' once. also, it doesn't let you 'forward' anymore.
[04:12:16] <walidvb> the easiest to reproduce is to visit  http://moijconnais.com . google really isn't helping unfortunately
[04:15:38] <walidvb> is anyone acquainted with html5's history?
[04:18:04] <ravenzz> walidvb try History.js
[04:18:32] <ravenzz> I think you should handle just the onstatechange
[04:19:07] <db42> how can i change the direction of an single listview item in jquery mobile ? (rtl)
[04:19:20] <walidvb> ravenzz: argh exactly what i wanted to avoid ;) thing is i don't need degradation. or state saving, i simply wanted to load my content via ajax and not reload the page.
[04:19:40] <walidvb> do you have any clue why the back button would behave the way it does?
[04:20:02] <walidvb> oh sry haven't seen. the onstatechange you say. lemme check that out
[04:27:32] <Krisostoomus> Hello. I have a probem with tableDnD parameters, they seem not to be working, for example I can't write 'onDrop: function (tb, row) {alert(1);}' into tableDnD. (tableDnD - table drag and drop plugin)
[04:29:39] <Krisostoomus> On http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ is written that it should work, but it doesn't.
[04:30:15] <Krisostoomus> Only initializing works
[04:30:58] <walidvb> ravenzz: hm so you reckon i should push a state when a user clicks on the 'bak' button?
[04:32:17] <db42> argh, any idea why playing an audio file works on safari but not on mobile safari (using <audio> tag) ?
[04:33:06] <ravenzz> walidvb I don't have that much experience with html5 history api, but I used History.js before
[04:33:08] <anew> can i make a spaceship with jquery ?
[04:33:52] <ravenzz> if you are willing to use the native one, without any helper library you should ask on #html I guess
[04:34:13] <walidvb> ok. I really don't want to spend too much time on this, no resources. but i'll give js another try and otherwise switch to history.js. i might be back here ;)
[04:34:33] <walidvb> oh. true, html would be more appropriate. i'll go there. but right now, gotta go :)
[04:34:36] <ravenzz> alright.. good luck ;)
[04:35:30] <db42> argh, so annoying, no sound on mobilesafari :(
[04:40:28] <trinadh_> db42: http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW1 , check this
[04:41:39] <saltcod> I'm trying to use object notation(or something like that) and I want to declare variables.
[04:41:39] <dwarder> i have this .weekCalendar associated with a div $('#mydiv').weekCalendar(); how do i remove this "association"?
[04:41:45] <saltcod> Isn't this:   kitchenSink: $('.site-title, .site-navigation, #primary')
[04:41:56] <saltcod> the same as this:   var kitchenSink = $('.site-title, .site-navigation, #primary')
[04:42:59] <fabioportieri> dwarder: check if the plugin has a method for its removal, like .destroy() or something
[04:44:20] <db42> trinadh_, seen it, still doesn't play.. i tried usin gffmpeg to transcode it to everythig possible ...
[04:44:31] <saltcod> Here's the whole function for more context:   https://gist.github.com/4352569
[04:44:45] <dwarder> fabioportieri: i don't think it has https://github.com/robmonie/jquery-week-calendar/blob/master/jquery.weekcalendar.js
[04:44:48] <saltcod> I'm getting:   Uncaught ReferenceError: kitchenSink is not defined
[04:46:00] <trinadh_> db42: it is something like the user has to explicitly click on a button or something for the audio to play
[04:46:06] <shoky> saltcod: you want this.kitchenSink.hide()
[04:46:13] <db42> trinadh_, an event frmo websocket
[04:46:47] <shoky> saltcod: and no, those 2 things you said are the same, are not the same
[04:47:00] <db42> even the 'error' event for playing the audio doesn't wokr
[04:47:06] <saltcod> how do you mean shoky: ?
[04:47:27] <shoky> saltcod:  var kitchenSink = ...;  declares a new variable in the current scope
[04:47:50] <shoky> saltcod:  kitchenSink: ....    is a key:value pair  inside an object literal, where the key is "kitchenSink"
[04:47:52] <trinadh_> db42: well from what i read it needs to be in stack of click events,I havent used , so might not be able to help you much
[04:48:18] <shoky> saltcod: and the key:value pair becomes a field of the resulting object.  that's why the 'this' is needed
[04:48:27] <db42> in stack of click events ? can i simulate it from an websocket i/o ?
[04:48:31] <muay-guy> I'm getting a "missing : after property id" with this little script and I'm not sure why http://jsfiddle.net/jK9ck/
[04:49:07] <shoky> muay-guy: $.upstream_backend = { ... }   declares an object
[04:49:21] <shoky> muay-guy:  inside an object literal you can only have 'key: value'   pairs
[04:49:27] <saltcod> interesting. thanks shoky: !
[04:50:02] <saltcod> and, shoky: , if I'd declared it like var kitchenSink = ...., I wouldn't need the this?
[04:50:42] <shoky> saltcod: depends where you declare it.. but generally yes. you can't put it inside an object literal instead of a key:value pair tho
[04:50:49] <fabioportieri> dwarder: indeed it has not :|
[04:51:00] <saltcod> But I can't declare a var while already inside a var (technically:   I can't declare a variable inside an object literal?)
[04:51:04] <muay-guy> shoky: I understand. Will I need to assign it to a function and add some extra listener to get this to work?
[04:51:15] <shoky> saltcod: you can only declare variables in the global scope or inside a function
[04:51:22] <saltcod> Right, shoky: , the second part of what you said!
[04:52:12] <shoky> muay-guy: i have no idea what you're trying to do with that $.upstream_backend
[04:52:26] <saltcod> Ok. So for a rule for me to remember:    Just declare variables normally ( using var)  when inside a function, but use key:value when inside an object literal
[04:52:50] <muay-guy> shoky: it was my understanding that it's a good practice to get all your code within a namespace
[04:52:57] <muay-guy> that's all I'm trying to do
[04:53:10] <shoky> saltcod: i guess.. they are different things (variables vs. fields in an object)
[04:53:57] <shoky> muay-guy: sure its good practice.. but even better practice is to write javascript
[04:53:58] <saltcod> Thats' true
[04:54:18] <eshlox> $.ajax({type: 'get', url: 'myurl', dataType : 'jsonp', jsonp : 'jsonp'}); firebug shows POST with status 302, how i can read result after this redirect?
[04:55:10] <db42> how can i debug why playing an <audio> tag via JS in Safari works, but not on MobileSafari on my iPhone ?
[04:55:19] <db42> (tried in multiplate codecs)
[04:56:20] <shoky> eshlox: POST? but you didnt send any POST
[04:57:19] <eshlox> shoky: yes, wrong question.. ;-S
[04:59:45] <db42> shoudl something like <script>var blah = 'a';</script><script>alert(blah);</script> work ok ?
[05:00:12] <eshlox> i use jquery file upload and data.sumbit() send POST data to server and this returns 302, i don't know how get result after redirect
[05:00:14] <shoky> db42 yup
[05:00:54] <shoky> eshlox: afaik redirects are handled by the browser for you.. the ajax response you get should be after the redirect already
[05:07:14] <Krisostoomus> Anyone also had problems with setting up tableDnD, only initialisation works for me, parameters don't work.
[05:07:16] <Krisostoomus> ?
[05:08:05] <faraway> eshlox: is the redirect to another domain ?
[05:09:37] <faraway> eshlox: e.g. domain.tld  to www.domain.tld   or form https to http or the other way round ?
[05:10:12] <eshlox> faraway: no, to the same domain from which comes POST
[05:10:49] <shoky> Krisostoomus: seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/r5eYX/
[05:12:23] <faraway> eshlox: and if you do a normal POST via a form to that url the redirect works ?
[05:13:57] <Krisostoomus> There it works but in my computer not
[05:14:31] <eshlox> shoky, faraway: i have something like this, http://wklej.org/id/903102/ data.submit() returns this POST with 302 status, data == result from this POST, but not from redirect..
[05:15:36] <faraway> eshlox: you have a message body in the 302 response ?
[05:17:52] <eshlox> faraway: hm, i can check this in firebug?
[05:18:02] <tra> is it ok to put some markup into an elements data?
[05:25:23] <shoky> tra: sure, if you must.
[05:26:09] <shoky> eshlox: what do you mean, data == result from this POST
[05:26:15] <shoky> eshlox: what data is that..?
[05:26:31] <tra> shoky: ok, do you know that could it cause any problems, for example with IE? :)
[05:27:01] <shoky> tra: anything can cause problems with IE.  what do you mean by "an elements data" ?
[05:27:46] <tra> shoky: like $().data('xoo', someMarkup);
[05:28:09] <tra> contents for a bootstrap popover
[05:28:12] <Krisostoomus> shoky, now it works..
[05:28:19] <Krisostoomus> unbelievably
[05:28:34] <Krisostoomus> I don't know why
[05:29:03] <shoky> tra: then it should be safe to put any kind of data there..
[05:29:09] <shoky> tra: but again.. with IE, who knows
[05:29:23] <tra> hehe yeah
[05:41:06] <eshlox> shoky: i get this from jquery file upload docs, this is in every callback and i can read this, maybe i should use another variable to get this..
[05:41:14] <Krisostoomus> Is there any way to get tablesorter work with tablednd? tablesorter wants a different table structure (thead, tbody keywords).
[05:44:31] <shoky> eshlox: sry dont really remember how to use that plugin
[06:03:48] <ThoMe> hello
[06:04:14] <ThoMe> $('#field').val($('#field').val().replace(/Ãœ/,'Ue')); <<is it posible to replace all umlauts
[06:04:31] <otherj> :( :( :( :( :(
[06:04:43] <ThoMe> from Ãœ > Ue, Ã¼ > ue, Ã– > Oe, Ã¶ > oe and Ã„ > Ae, Ã¤ > ae
[06:04:45] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[06:05:17] <otherj> sorry to be that guy, but why do it in js?
[06:06:21] <otherj> str.replace(/\u00e4/g, "ae")
[06:16:07] <ThoMe> otherj: thx
[06:16:22] <otherj> bitte
[06:16:35] <ThoMe> otherj: :P
[06:16:48] <Led_Zeppelin> hi
[06:17:18] <Led_Zeppelin> I have some code like this, http://pastebin.ca/2295516 , which refreshes the page after 5 secs and places the content in a div
[06:17:34] <ThoMe> otherj: my solution http://paste.debian.net/218033/
[06:17:37] <Led_Zeppelin> however, it seems I have to wait for 5 secs for the data to come thru, is it possible to get data first and then wait 5 secs?
[06:19:02] <saltcod> This is probably asking a lot, but I wonder if someone could have a quick look at this bit code https://gist.github.com/4353094  ( please? )
[06:19:38] <saltcod> I'm trying to learn how to structure things properly rather than just selecting everything and running show() and hide(), etc on them
[06:19:49] <otherj> ThoMe: if you use the unicode char, you will know it works every time
[06:20:18] <otherj> although personally, i wish the umlaut was not deemphasized. i also wish we keep the esset
[06:20:23] <otherj> now it's all ss everywhere
[06:27:05] <db42> how can i make in jquery mobile a slideable listview item (that will open a button list) ?
[06:30:34] <codepython777> Does anyone know what I am doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/740/ ?
[06:31:21] <codepython777> I just want the file browser to pop up when i click the button
[06:31:29] <codepython777> But on chrome i get an infinite recursion!
[06:34:32] <shoky> codepython777: you're triggering a click on the input which is inside the <div>
[06:34:40] <shoky> codepython777: and youre doing that inside a click handler..
[06:34:44] <shoky> on the same <div>
[06:35:27] <shoky> anyway you can't do what you're trying to do, afaik
[06:36:12] <codepython777> shoky: I just want to click a file upload button using JS. Can't be done? Why not?
[06:36:30] <Saaether> your causing the recursion your self
[06:36:36] <Saaether> just move the field out of the div
[06:36:38] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/741/
[06:36:40] <Saaether> problem sovled
[06:36:43] <shoky> codepython777: because browsers don't allow it. anyway here's a fix for the recursion: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MgcDU/742/
[06:37:34] <codepython777> Thanks. Where can i read about this recursion effect and why its happening.
[06:37:43] <shoky> dude
[06:37:47] <shoky> you triggered a click
[06:37:57] <shoky> so your handler gets triggered, due to event bubbling
[06:38:06] <codepython777> that i understand
[06:38:07] <shoky> because the <input> is INSIDE the same div you're handling clicks on
[06:38:24] <shoky> that's the only recusrion going on...
[06:41:21] <shoky> actually seeing Saaether's fiddle i might be mistaken about what isaid
[06:42:07] <shoky> (about it not being allowed)
[06:43:21] <codepython777> shoky: I am trying to upload a file to the browser, without sending it to the backend. Its an image
[06:43:36] <codepython777> If the user clicks save, then its sent to the backend
[06:43:44] <codepython777> is this something that a browser wont allow?
[06:44:08] <codepython777> So now i have to read the image the user selects using JS and render it on the page
[06:44:37] <shoky> codepython777: sorry i misunderstood what you were doing, and also i guess im wrong about the triggering click on file-input from JS not being allowed
[06:44:49] <shoky> i swear it wasn't allowed a while ago ;[
[06:45:09] <shoky> codepython777: so feel free to ignore anything i said, except about the recursion ;p
[06:45:21] <codepython777> shoky: how do i read the file in JS? I need to read a png or jpeg?
[06:45:41] <codepython777> and i want to render it on the page
[06:46:03] <shoky> i remember the file upload plugin pages had examples of doing that..
[06:48:56] <codepython777> shoky: This example I think --> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[06:49:18] <shoky> welp.. follow the docs & examples :P
[06:49:28] <codepython777> I dont know how to get this information from jquery-fupload thou
[06:49:38] <eshlox> ;->
[06:50:46] <shoky> codepython777 do you have your server side setup for working with the plugin?
[06:51:16] <eshlox> another question, can i get .submit(); response? ;->
[06:51:32] <Saaether> codepython777  http://jsfiddle.net/CuyW7/ here is a preview before upload
[06:51:42] <Saaether> using only javascript
[06:52:24] <Saaether> oops left some extra stuff in there, http://jsfiddle.net/CuyW7/1/
[06:52:25] <untaken> I have some html generated via javascript. How would I hide a button that had been generated? Using jQuery("#id").hide(); doesn't work?
[06:54:25] <dawra> if i send {a: 20} in $.post does jqueyr converts 20 (int) to '20' (string) ?
[06:54:52] <codepython777> Saaether: Thanks a lot!
[06:54:57] <Saaether> np
[06:55:06] <Saaether> untaken you have some sample code?
[06:55:08] <codepython777> Would have taken me a day to research that
[06:56:30] <codepython777> Saaether: what can i read to be able to write that code fast? Any tutorial pointers?
[06:57:44] <codepython777> Saaether: Or do you recommend using something like this: http://bgrins.github.com/filereader.js/ ?
[06:57:51] <untaken> Saaether: http://pastebin.com/E5uiRZEz
[06:58:32] <trinadh> codepython777: http://html5demos.com/file-api , http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[07:01:13] <Saaether> untaken does the html exist on the page at the time you're trying to hide it?
[07:01:36] <untaken> Saaether: no, its generated within jQuery(document).ready(function () { for the rows
[07:01:47] <untaken> within the table row, I add this button
[07:02:17] <untaken> I basically want it disabled, until someone clicks on a text box in that row and alters the text, then the button shows
[07:04:17] <Saaether> when you are generating the button why not set it to disabled, then listen for clicks on the textbox to enable it?
[07:06:01] <untaken> Saaether: I would prefer it hidden. Is that possible?
[07:06:31] <Saaether> sure, just add style='display:none;' to the button when you're creating it
[07:06:37] <NoiseEee> untaken: the only problem with that is it implies the form is not submittable, like wtf is it doing
[07:06:47] <NoiseEee> untaken: its a personal choice but consider what users expect.
[07:07:59] <untaken> NoiseEee: well the idea was a text field would be show on that row, and if they wanted to change the value they can a button would then show up next to it, after they start changing the text. The button then could make some json api call or something
[07:08:17] <untaken> NoiseEee: may need to think a little simpler I guess
[07:08:46] <untaken> Saaether: I'll give that a go. As long as jQuery("#update_price_button").show(); works when I need it :)
[07:09:57] <untaken> which it don't (just tried). I guess the generated html is not adding it to the DOM or something? My understanding on all this is limited
[07:10:46] <trinadh> untaken: need to do it after the code is generated
[07:11:15] <untaken> trinadh: I just did, from the web console. I ran jQuery("#update_price_button").show;
[07:12:06] <untaken> I can see the line in firebug:
[07:12:15] <untaken> <input id="update_price_button" type="button" style="display:none;" name="update_price_button">
[07:13:02] <trinadh> untaken: how are you adding that html to the document.. , would be better if you can fiddle it..
[07:13:48] <untaken> trinadh: its generated in jQuery(document).ready(function () { .... which calls a JS function which does a json api call to obtain the rows, which get built up
[07:16:19] <trinadh> untaken: so do you add them to the page using say $('#something').html(returnedRows)
[07:17:24] <untaken> trinadh: yes
[07:17:25] <untaken> jQuery("#domain_table_div").html(tableHtml + "</table>");
[07:17:35] <untaken> tableHtml is all the content :)
[07:18:46] <trinadh> write the code to show just after it
[07:20:07] <untaken> trinadh: but the code is already generated? I can see it in firebug? I don't think I understand what you mean sorry?
[07:20:22] <trinadh> give me a min..
[07:21:16] <untaken> sure
[07:22:18] <Saaether> untaken heres some sample code i made up quickly which emulates what i think you are trying to do
[07:22:19] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/qnvvq/
[07:22:38] * untaken takes a look
[07:24:18] <untaken> Saaether: thanks for that. I'll try and add it, and see if it works on dev
[07:25:04] <untaken> Saaether: would this go in jQuery(document).ready(function () { })
[07:25:12] <Saaether> yup
[07:26:44] <untaken> ta
[07:29:47] <untaken> Saaether: works a dream :) thank you!
[07:29:53] <Saaether> np
[07:34:08] <trinadh> untaken: http://jsfiddle.net/trinadh/EDh7k/
[07:34:45] <untaken> thanks trinadh will take look too
[07:35:14] <untaken> choices choices :) nice one guys
[07:35:50] <trinadh> untaken: its the same as Saaether: , didnt see he already fiddled it
[07:36:18] <Saaether> pretty much the same, mine allows for more then 1 row though
[07:37:17] <trinadh> Saaether: right.. :) thats the better one
[07:46:34] <jayrads> Hey all. I'm trying to grab some html from my page using .html() function. For some reason that I can't figure out, jquery removes the closing slash on my self closed html elements (ex. <img /> and <input />). The exported html isn't valid xhtml. Is this expected behavior?
[07:47:41] <NoiseEee> are you really concerned/specifically authoring xhtml for a reason jayrads?
[07:47:50] <NoiseEee> its html5 days ya know
[07:48:43] <jayrads> Heh, yeah. This specific xhtml goes to a java class which uses iText to generate a pdf.
[07:53:53] <NoiseEee> are you serving the page as application/xml+xhtml ?
[07:54:53] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1923064/jquery-remove-from-img-tag @ jayrads
[07:56:40] <jayrads> NoiseEee: Yes. Funny thing. jQuery also removes the closing slash in <meta> tags. So those don't validate either. :)
[08:00:35] <NoiseEee> well maybe you want to grab html via the backend then
[08:01:16] <NoiseEee> jayrads: as long as the page is served xml+xhtml, those answers suggest that jquery ops will return the closing slashes on those pages?
[08:01:17] <Cronoh> validate
[08:04:17] <jayrads> NoiseEee: Yeah, it looks like I'll just have to submit to a different jsp page and pass the whole request to the java class. Was trying to do it all ajaxy-like
[08:16:10] <untaken> how I access a <input> with a class and id? If there are multiple buttons for instance, with the same class="" but they have different id's. If I try the id on its own, that doesn't work. ie jQuery("#my_id").val(); doesn't work
[08:16:20] <guy> $.ajax request does not have a callback to indicate that a request was made? (ie. before the response is received)
[08:16:30] <untaken> can I do something like this jQuery(".myclass.myid").val();
[08:17:00] <guy> all I need is to know that the request was made to the server, I don't case about the output.
[08:17:02] <NoiseEee> untaken: whats the point of doing anything but an id lookup?
[08:17:40] <untaken> NoiseEee: thats what I first tried, but didn't seem to work. It came back with undefined.
[08:17:58] <untaken> wasn't sure if you needed to anything special when you have a class="" and id=""
[08:19:10] <NoiseEee> untaken: since there can only be one element with that id, you should be just getting it via $('#theID')
[08:19:58] <untaken> NoiseEee: thats what I was doing. This is JS generated code, but odd its not returning anything, just undefined. I'll make sure there aren't more than one
[08:22:45] <trinadh> guy: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[08:23:35] <untaken> NoiseEee: very odd, there is only one. I can access it via .myclass  but not via #myid
[08:24:13] <NoiseEee> then either you have the wrong ID or the element isn't in the document.  debug/console.log
[08:24:13] <guy> I guess I need ajaxStart. Thank you trinadh.

[08:25:21] <Dr4g> Hey folks.
[08:26:33] <codepython777> I change an image on my page using JS. Now when I issue location.reload() the image is not reloaded.
[08:26:36] <codepython777> How can i fix this?
[08:26:42] <untaken> NoiseEee: ahh the element is there, but when .val() is undefined. Odd.
[08:27:12] <rasu> hello i am trying to show a confirm when the $(widnow).unload event is triggered. but i cant get it to be shownd. how do i fix this problem?
[08:27:18] <NoiseEee> untaken: does it have a value ?
[08:27:27] <untaken> on the page yes
[08:27:40] <NoiseEee> well try to recreate on jsfiddle maybe
[08:28:07] <codepython777> location.reload(true) -- whats the correct way of doing this?
[08:28:21] <thinboy> Hey guys can anyone tell me if this code is correct, if not tell me why. <script type="text/javascript">
[08:28:22] <thinboy> if ($(window).width() < 480 || $(window).height() < 480) {
[08:28:22] <thinboy> / stuff here
[08:28:22] <thinboy> </script>
[08:29:22] <ewaibel> hi, i'm looking for a client-side library that will convert a given webpage into a PNG image?
[08:30:02] <danheberden> thinboy: well, it seems silly to make a jQ object every time, but that is semantically right
[08:31:15] <thinboy> daheberden: what do you mean "silly to make a jQ object everytime"?
[08:31:33] <danheberden> ewaibel: you can look at html2canvas but it's definitely limited
[08:31:38] <Fallout2man> So odd question, but is there a specific DOM event fired when a new element is programatically added?
[08:31:39] <thinboy> danheberden: : what do you mean "silly to make a jQ object everytime"?
[08:31:57] <Fallout2man> I ask because I'm deploying a mobile website/app and the problem is it has to go on a platform that's not 100% mature.
[08:32:01] <danheberden> e.g., if you have images not from your domain you can't use the canvas.toDataUrl() method or whatever
[08:32:02] <Fallout2man> It adds an annoying spinnner
[08:32:17] <Fallout2man> and I have to somehow create a live event that will detect and automatically remove it when their platform tries to add it.
[08:33:29] <danheberden> Fallout2man: DOMNodeInserted and the like, but not on IE 6-8/9 (i *think* not on 9, could be wrong)
[08:33:40] <danheberden> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html
[08:33:51] <Fallout2man> danheberden: Danke! This is mobile safari based
[08:34:00] <danheberden> thinboy: instead of $(window) a bunch, store that in a variable: var $window = $(window);
[08:34:09] <danheberden> that way, you aren't making a new jQuery object around window twice - just once
[08:34:24] <danheberden> $window.height() > 480 || $window.width() < 480 or whatever you were doing
[08:35:00] <thinboy> Got it.
[08:35:19] <trinadh> codepython777: location.reload will reload the page, like hitting refresh button
[08:35:45] <thinboy> danheberden: thanks. I tried to add a simple alert within that statement. But its not working. What do you think is the problem?
[08:35:58] <trinadh> codepython777: so any code made changes should be lost
[08:36:34] <danheberden> thinboy: no idea - store the values in variables and add a `debugger;` statement to investigate
[08:36:39] <danheberden> var height = $window.height(); etc
[08:36:58] <danheberden> tldr; look at each piece to make sure it's the value you're anticipating
[08:39:01] <JSM87> Hi guys, im trying to make it so when someone fills in a <select> box, it will automatically focus to the next one. What im trying is not working: SEE http://pastebin.com/3D2YEvTy
[08:39:31] <danheberden> JSM87: next is assuming the next element is a select
[08:39:42] <JSM87> danheberden: yes, which it is
[08:39:45] <danheberden> you probaly want nextUntil
[08:39:49] <JSM87> oh, let me try
[08:39:58] <danheberden> like - no wrapper or anything?
[08:40:22] <JSM87> danheberden: tried nextUntil, still isnt working. Your right about the wrapper e.g divs etc
[08:40:30] <JSM87> I need it to go to next select field, downwards
[08:40:35] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[08:40:50] <danheberden> is there a common parent structure?
[08:40:57] <danheberden> like - what the selects are in?
[08:41:17] <danheberden> it might be better to find out where your select is in regards to ALL the selects
[08:41:20] <danheberden> and find the next one that way
[08:41:33] <danheberden> like var $selects = $('#yourForm select');
[08:41:43] <JSM87> danheberden: ive just ran my code in jsfiddle and it works, however there is no wrappers etc
[08:42:23] <danheberden> var $index = $selects.index( this ); // assuming this is in your change event and this is the select
[08:42:34] <danheberden> then $selects.eq( $index + 1 ).focus()
[08:42:40] <danheberden> does that make sense JSM87?
[08:42:57] <BillCriswell> JSM87: next() would only work on siblings.
[08:43:18] <JSM87> BillCriswell: Ok. what can I use to make it find the next select downwards, no matter where it is
[08:43:21] <JSM87> e.g in wrappers etc
[08:43:34] <BillCriswell> danheberden's answer should do what you want.
[08:44:07] <danheberden> better than trompsing around the DOM
[08:44:10] <BillCriswell> Just saying "wrappers" gives us no idea of the HTML in place, danheberden's method would work regardless of wrappers.
[08:44:47] <danheberden> keep in mind you could get all the form elements with that technique as well
[08:45:22] <danheberden> var $inputs = $('#myForm *:input');
[08:45:31] <JSM87> danheberden: just trying now
[08:46:37] <s34n> my cycle pager shows only a small dot for each slide, not the large styled dot. And it doesn't mark the dot for the current active slide. And the cursor doesn't change over the dots.
[08:46:45] <thinboy> danheberden : Do you know how will i know the valu of ($(window).width() in my statement?
[08:46:48] <velcrobots> trying to horizontally slide divs inside a container: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/ffAsR/
[08:46:54] <s34n> In short, it seems that I am missing a css stylesheet
[08:47:07] <rakl> anyone used jquery ui-datepicker ?
[08:47:14] <danheberden> ?ask @ rakl
[08:47:15] <bot-t> rakl, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:48:10] <rakl> using ui-datepicker and this is happening: http://minus.com/lL888zT2aujfS
[08:48:22] <rakl> wonder if anyone else has seen that and might know a quickfix
[08:48:32] <JSM87> danheberden: Please check this, Im not 100% on the way youve explained but check to see if this is correct as its not working@: http://pastebin.com/DXbphRUB
[08:48:51] <rakl> it's the morning of the presentation and have no time to delve into the code
[08:49:03] <thinboy> In this statement: if ($(window).width() < 480 || $(window).height() < 480) { how will i know the value of $(window).width()?
[08:49:04] <rakl> using in multiple places and it's only breaking there
[08:49:30] <mr_blue> hi all
[08:49:32] <mr_blue> does someone use the fullcalendar jquery plugin ?
[08:49:52] <rakl> was just asking about ui-datepicker
[08:49:59] <trinadh> thinboy: use a variable, var w = $(window).width(); and use it in the condition as well as to log to console
[08:50:18] <Hapzzz> so i have a .get() that replaces the content of some div, but then other binds won't work
[08:50:33] <Hapzzz> even though i used $('a').on("click", function(){...});
[08:50:51] <thinboy> trinadh: can you put the code here? I am not sure If I get what you've said.
[08:51:05] <trinadh> rakl: may be its an issue in the style sheet.
[08:51:08] <danheberden> JSM87: http://pastebin.com/jy6KwPAi
[08:51:16] <danheberden> added some clean up there
[08:51:29] <iatkotep> Does anybody know of a scroll animation library like Scrollorama.js that will pause the upward motion of my page as the scrolling animation is taking place?
[08:52:00] <danheberden> rakl - we'll need an idea of what you're trying to do. datepicker works with multiple instances, yes
[08:52:10] <danheberden> make a quick demo of what you're trying to do on jsfiddle.net or something
[08:52:29] <JSM87> danheberden: That didnt work...
[08:53:02] <trinadh> thinboy:  var $win = $(window); var w = $win.width(); var h = $win.height(); console.log(w+";"+h); if(w<480 || h<480) console.log('test evaluates to true');
[08:53:09] <JSM87> danheberden: the onchange event is firing as ive just put in alert('it changed'); which fired ok
[08:53:18] <danheberden> oh, JSM87 a small typo you had
[08:53:23] <danheberden> not $(this).eq...
[08:53:26] <danheberden> $selects.eq(
[08:53:30] <danheberden> on that last line
[08:53:46] <danheberden> cuz you want to get the next index of the selects
[08:53:50] <thinboy> trinadh: thanks! I'll try it.
[08:53:59] <Hapzzz> anyone?
[08:54:00] <JSM87> danheberden: worked. super :-)
[08:55:15] <trinadh> Hapzzz: are you writing the code within the get's success function?
[08:55:53] <JSM87> danheberden: Dam. The whole point of this was so when filling in a form on my mobile app, it auto brings up the next select when filled in previos. I can see that its getting the focus as the colour changes but it doesnt actually cause the iphone to bring up the options to select... IS there another way other than focus() that may trigger this
[08:56:06] <Hapzzz> trinadh yes
[08:59:48] <shoky> Hapzzz: $('a').on("click", function..   is the same as $('a').click(function..
[09:00:04] <Hapzzz> the manual says .on is the "new" .live, isn't it?
[09:00:04] <shoky> Hapzzz: you want maybe.. $('#container').on('click', 'a', function() { ... });
[09:00:13] <shoky> Hapzzz: you need to read how to use .on
[09:00:18] <Hapzzz> i will.
[09:00:20] <Hapzzz> thanks.
[09:00:33] <Hapzzz> gotta be missing something ')
[09:00:45] <shoky> Hapzzz: read the section 'event delegation'
[09:10:24] <tangorri> hmm, what the hell mean this console error please ? : 4Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[09:12:15] <Zzaichik> tangorri: probably need to see the code, create something in jsfiddle
[09:12:57] <tangorri> Zzaichik:  here https://github.com/tangorri/Tangorri-web/blob/master/public/index.html
[09:18:59] <Zzaichik> tangorri: it didn't give a line number? Are you sure it's in that file and not a js file? (I'm not going to sift through your entire code base man - I don't have time to do that...
[09:19:32] <Zzaichik> )
[09:27:52] <wroathe> tangorri: Are you getting that when performing an AJAX request?
[09:28:51] <wroathe> tangorri: Or perhaps you're trying to interpret an HTML document as a JS document? <script type="text/javascript" src="this-does-not-work.html"></script>
[09:31:44] <tangorri> wroathe:  well, I got this at page loading
[09:31:58] <tangorri> and it gives me (chrome console) line 1 of index.html
[09:37:19] <NoiseEee> tangorri: basically, search for a lone < character or whatever it is.  that's all anyone else here would be doing with your code.
[09:37:46] <tangorri> I've done it, firebug show me different error
[09:37:52] <NoiseEee> which is?
[09:38:24] <tangorri> http://tof.canardpc.com/view/0725ca6a-d657-4d5b-89d7-c8d6aa9b5e50.jpg
[09:39:36] <NoiseEee> tangorri: figure it out dude.
[09:39:51] <NoiseEee> looks like you've put that into JS?!
[09:39:52] <shoky> most likely what wroathe said. chrome's trying to interpret HTML as JS
[09:39:54] <tangorri> oh I think that's url mistakes
[09:40:27] <shoky> tangorri look at the network tab in devtools when loading the page
[09:40:52] <shoky> look at SCRIPT requests that are not to an actual script
[09:40:58] <shoky> and see where they're coming from
[09:41:26] <wroathe> tangorri: Step 1: Open Chrome Dev Tools, Step 2: Go to Network tab, Step 3: Refresh page, Step 4: Look for 404s.
[09:41:26] <tangorri> I got 302 code for many js
[09:41:37] <shoky> it won't be a 404 i think
[09:41:46] <tangorri> no 404
[09:42:02] <shoky> tangorri: click scripts on the bottom, so it only shows scripts
[09:42:05] <shoky> script requests
[09:42:13] <tangorri> same all 200 ok in script
[09:42:20] <shoky> ok, but their urls
[09:42:23] <shoky> are they all to real .js files ?
[09:42:50] <tangorri> js or json
[09:43:10] <wroathe> tangorri: Probably an incorrect mime type then
[09:43:14] <tangorri> ok
[09:43:15] <shoky> when you view each of them , they contain only JS code ?
[09:43:17] <wroathe> tangorri: Can you link us to the actual site you're working on?
[09:43:21] <shoky> no HTML
[09:43:22] <shoky> ?
[09:43:24] <tangorri> yes
[09:43:54] <shoky> oh
[09:44:00] <shoky> you said its line 1 of index.html
[09:44:04] <tangorri> no html only js or json
[09:44:05] <shoky> there's no script request for index.html ?
[09:44:26] <tangorri> I think that's related to my urlrewrite ....
[09:44:29] <tangorri> sorry guys
[09:45:04] <tangorri> I have something like any adresse redirect to index.html so that's may be the purpose :P
[09:45:16] <shoky> yerp
[09:45:20] <wroathe> ...
[09:45:23] <wroathe> tangorri: https://github.com/tangorri/Tangorri-web/blob/master/web.rb
[09:45:25] <wroathe> seriously?
[09:45:30] <wroathe> That didn't seem like a bad idea?
[09:45:35] <tangorri> https://github.com/tangorri/Tangorri-web/blob/master/web.rb sorry guys
[09:45:38] <shoky> haha
[09:45:42] <tangorri> ^^
[09:45:43] <wroathe> I guess anyone can be a consultant.
[09:46:01] <tangorri> I need to filter it to html
[09:46:50] <tangorri> ok full of 404 now \o/
[09:47:19] <wroathe> "We've brought in a consultant to solve our problems. Tangorri, take it away." "Ok guys, what you need to do with your platform is redirect all get requests to index.html. It's the wave of the future."
[09:47:34] <wroathe> "Brilliant!"
[09:47:43] <tangorri> -_-
[09:47:54] <shoky> and the paradigm was shifted.
[09:47:59] <tangorri> I believed it would filter the route to html
[09:48:08] <tangorri> cause that's for my one page site
[09:48:13] <wroathe> * typically means "ALL THE THINGS"
[09:48:21] <tangorri> I agreee it was a bas idea btw
[09:48:37] <tangorri> again SOOOOORRRRYYYY :)
[09:48:58] <tangorri> firebug console is more explicit than chrome
[09:49:22] <wroathe> tangorri: explicit meaning verbose... Most of the information it spits at you isn't really actionable.
[09:49:34] <wroathe> or useful for that matter
[09:49:49] <wroathe> "ERR MER GERD YOU USED VENDOR PREFIXES IN YOUR CSS"
[09:50:06] <Tales1> is there a different function to detect key inputs? not keypress?
[09:50:13] <tangorri> wroathe:  what ?
[09:50:46] <Terriblist> helo
[09:50:49] <Terriblist> o/
[09:50:51] <wroathe> Tales1: keypress is typically what you want for that
[09:52:33] <katsh> is $('#checkbox').is(':checked') the proper way to check if it's checked?
[09:52:50] <Tales1> ok, and how do i convert the e.which to a char? 65 = A ?
[09:53:19] <wroathe> Tales1: Post code. You're probably attacking this wrong.
[09:53:35] <Tales1> ok, just a sec...
[09:53:50] <wroathe> katsh: yes
[09:54:11] <wroathe> katsh: Make sure #checkbox is the actual input element
[09:54:38] <Tales1> oh... itÅ› working... sorry, iÄºl paste anyway
[09:55:51] <Tales1> $( '#input' ).keypress( function( e ){
[09:55:52] <Tales1> 	$( "#output" ).val( clean_accents( $( "#output" ).val() + String.fromCharCode( e.which ) ) );
[09:55:52] <Tales1> } );
[09:55:54] <wroathe> ...
[09:56:27] <katsh> wroathe: thanks
[09:56:57] <Tales1> itÅ› a function to clean a string and output elsewhere (both are textareas)
[09:57:28] <wroathe> What's the command to tell the bot to tell people to post code on jsfiddle or the like?
[09:57:33] <wroathe> shoky:
[09:57:41] <ajpiano> ?demo
[09:57:42] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:57:47] <wroathe> ajpiano: ty
[09:58:10] <wroathe> Or gist would be good too.
[09:59:54] <wroathe> Tales1: Why not do something like $('#output').val( clean_accents($(e.target).val()) )
[10:00:32] <wroathe> #input is a text field right?
[10:00:52] <wroathe> and #output is a different field and you're just placing the contents of input into output?
[10:01:00] <wroathe> the String.fromCharCode is a really roundabout way of doing that
[10:06:31] <Tales1> keypress doesn't detect backspace?
[10:07:23] <wroathe> Tales1: The way you're doing that is wrong.
[10:08:03] <wroathe> Tales1: https://gist.github.com/798a47b6891a2251402e
[10:08:14] <wroathe> Tales1: I think that's what you're trying to do.
[10:08:26] <Tales1> let me check, thanks :D
[10:09:07] <velcrobots> trying to get a scrolling effect inside a container div: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/ffAsR/
[10:14:14] <wroathe> velcrobots: Looking at it now.
[10:14:46] <velcrobots> wroathe: thanks.  i dunno if the hidden overflow is killing it or what
[10:18:22] <sealeaf> Hi, after using .parents() to get a table, how would I loop through the table's rows?
[10:22:33] <wroathe> velcrobots: #nm12-months {position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width: 400px; height:469px; z-index:99; overflow-y:scroll}
[10:22:54] <wroathe> velcrobots: set a width on that and allow overflow-y: scroll
[10:23:19] <sealeaf> Or more generally, how would I loop through the elements that are part of a jquery object?
[10:23:35] <wroathe> sealeaf: https://gist.github.com/
[10:25:09] <sealeaf> wroathe: I'm trying to loop through the rows in a table jquery object https://gist.github.com/4354749
[10:25:20] <Zzaichik> .each() maybe?
[10:25:21] <sealeaf> The line of code to get the table object is in the gist.
[10:25:35] <Saaether> sealeaf if you have the table you could use .children() to get the rows or what ever it is your looking for
[10:25:55] <velcrobots> wroathe: got that in there, but still seems a bit funky http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/ffAsR/
[10:25:56] <hlve> How would I create a function that finds and checks only 20 checkboxes on a page?
[10:27:11] <kaylee> does .on() work on dynamically generated content? Or do I need to be using .live()?
[10:27:20] <Saaether> yes it works
[10:27:25] <Saaether> .on() replaced .live()
[10:27:33] <wroathe> velcrobots: I pulled the JS fiddle example down and worked with it locally and it works for me. Not sure what's different.
[10:27:35] <kaylee> ok, that's what I thought. Just making sure
[10:27:41] <kaylee> my selector must be bad then
[10:27:46] <wroathe> velcrobots: Anyway, that's the problem. You're trying to scroll an element that isn't scrollable.
[10:27:55] <velcrobots> ok i'll give it a shot.  thanks for your help!
[10:28:04] <lxsameer> how can i iterate all tags inside a certain tag ?
[10:28:29] <wroathe> lxsameer: Post code
[10:28:34] <sealeaf> Saether: Hmm, trying it now.
[10:28:55] <wroathe> lxsameer: lxsameer $('#tag').children().each(function (ind, elem) { // do stuff });
[10:29:21] <optraz_> i have a html select with a few options . when user click on the select, how do i add the selected field to the existing input field?
[10:29:46] <lxsameer> wroathe: thanks
[10:30:00] <wroathe> optraz_: https://gist.github.com/
[10:30:41] <optraz_> wroathe: what?
[10:30:48] <wroathe> optraz_: post an example
[10:30:55] <wroathe> optraz_: of what you're trying to accomplish
[10:31:03] <wroathe> Help us help you
[10:31:12] <optraz_> ohh
[10:31:13] <optraz_> okay
[10:31:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a jquery accordion and after an ajax call I want to refresh it, but it doesn't refresh... in the success function of the ajax call I do $(".folders").accordion("refresh"); - but nothing happens :/
[10:31:15] <optraz_> wait
[10:31:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone know why?
[10:31:41] <wroathe> ?demo
[10:31:41] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:32:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I can't, it's using all kinds of plugin and php scripts
[10:32:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I can paste the ajax code if that would help?
[10:32:39] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: Doesn't have to be working. Just post a https://gist.github.com/
[10:32:48] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: with the markup and the ajax code
[10:34:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Here it is: https://gist.github.com/4354794
[10:34:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Please note that alert("success"); does work... in the ajax success function... so it does get in there
[10:35:02] <optraz> wroathe: https://gist.github.com/407c2e85e59d77addfc5  i want user can select multiples fruits.
[10:35:32] <sealeaf> I'm having trouble getting a table row's parent table and looping through the rows.
[10:36:38] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: Ensure the accordion's panels have content at the time the refresh happens
[10:36:58] <sealeaf> I'm doing this https://gist.github.com/4354817, to try and loop through each table row, but it's not working.
[10:37:15] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: I don't see you adding the returned content from the request into the page anywhere in that code.
[10:37:26] <hazamonzo> hey folks. I have some hover animation set for a div. It looks like this.. http://paste.kde.org/629390/thing is.. my div contains other items like headers and such. When i hover these items in the widget div the animation is toggled off (also when you hover the headers and such inside the div the animation is not executed)
[10:37:42] <hazamonzo> How might i set ANY item within the widget div to fire the animation
[10:38:00] <hazamonzo> But it must only fire one, not everytime you hover a new item in the div
[10:38:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> wroathe: why should I if it refreshes?
[10:38:36] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: I think you're misunderstanding the point of refresh
[10:38:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I could drop the html stuff in there, but won't it be easier to refresh the data of the accordion section?
[10:38:51] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#method-refresh
[10:38:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh sorry..
[10:39:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yeah, that's what i'm using
[10:39:22] <wroathe> ecky--ptang-zoob: In order to recompute the height for the panels the panels are going to need to have updated content.
[10:39:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh, it does not actually re-fezsh?
[10:39:30] <ryanneufeld> ecky--ptang-zoob: NI!!
[10:39:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> refresh*
[10:39:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> damn wroathe, you're right... feel stupid now!!!
[10:39:50] <wroathe> optraz: I have no idea what you're trying to accomplish
[10:39:57] <wroathe> optraz: A multi select?
[10:39:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> WE ARE NO LONGER THE KNIGHTS WHO SAY NI!!! (ni, ni)
[10:40:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> We are now the knights who say ECKY ECKY PTANG ZOOOBOIIINGG (ni, ni)
[10:40:20] <hazamonzo> lol
[10:40:23] <hazamonzo> thoughts? :)
[10:40:25] <optraz> wroathe: a user can select apple, then later he can select orange.
[10:40:37] <wroathe> optraz: http://developers.whatwg.org/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-multiple-attribute
[10:41:20] <ryanneufeld> ecky--ptang-zoob: NI NI NI NI NI NI NI NI
[10:43:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> go find me a shrubbery!
[10:43:42] <hlve> what are the upsides to using jquery 1.9?
[10:43:45] <hlve> when it comes out
[10:43:47] <hlve> u_o?
[10:44:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Noo! Noo!
[10:44:55] <hlve> The changelog just says that they depricated a ton of stuff, and requires a backwards compatibility plugin in order for old plugins to continue to work
[10:45:18] <velcrobots> wroathe: when you took it down locally, you used my html too?  in other words, your container size was the same?  this just isn't working.
[10:46:53] <optraz> wroathe: that is a good link :) but it only allow to select 1. I wuold like to select more than 1, how do i od that?
[10:47:47] <wroathe> velcrobots: I'll post what I have
[10:48:10] <wroathe> velcrobots: https://gist.github.com/d844d65d92787ba9d661
[10:49:45] <wroathe> optraz: Read the example markup they have under that attribute
[10:50:27] <Terriblist> omg
[10:50:34] <velcrobots> wroathe: i just put that code up, it's just sort of twitchign back and forth: http://ainalerts.com/test.htm
[10:50:45] <Terriblist> i h8 drawing letters and lines via X and Y
[10:50:58] <Terriblist> isnt it 2013?
[10:51:06] <popof_> if I have the following json how do I return the reference object with index "-1"? query.pages[0] doesn't do it.
[10:51:06] <popof_> ({"query":{"pages":{"-1":{"ns":0,"title":"University of Florida%","missing":""}}}})
[10:51:15] <popof_> how do I reference*
[10:51:17] <popof_> not return
[10:51:22] <wroathe> velcrobots: Yeah. That's what you're saying in the code. "Scroll this element to the left this many pixels"
[10:51:50] <wroathe> velcrobots: So you need to think about what elements you want to scroll
[10:51:52] <velcrobots> wroathe: oh.  i want to scroll to the respective #ids
[10:52:22] <popof_> nevermind http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4491272/how-do-i-access-the-first-key-of-an-associative-array-in-javascript
[10:52:28] <wroathe> velcrobots: What you're scrolling right now is jQuery("#nm12-months")
[10:52:35] <Terriblist> lol
[10:52:44] <ryanneufeld> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/335/d/0/shrubbery_by_shelldevil-d340lrg.jpg
[10:53:16] <velcrobots> wroathe: right.  and clicking, say, April, on the left, should scroll #nm12-months to the left until #apr div
[10:55:00] <wroathe> velcrobots: velcrobots .offset().left gets the CURRENT offset
[10:55:23] <velcrobots> ah so i need to find the offset #apr before i can scroll to it
[10:55:51] <wroathe> console.log(jQuery(this.hash).offset().left);
[10:55:58] <wroathe> Put that right above your .animate line
[10:56:04] <wroathe> and you can see what I mean
[10:57:38] <velcrobots> so should this.hash go into offset?
[10:59:25] <optraz> wroathe: thank you for the link, i tried using datalist with addition, the first work but subsequent add is not possible, could u take a look please?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZsKKq/
[11:02:57] <hazamonzo> hmmm, http://jsfiddle.net/wpg8j/1/ this works but locally when i hover over a p or H1 tag ect it either doesn't fire the animation or stops it... if you know what i mean?
[11:03:05] <wroathe> velcrobots: one sec
[11:13:07] <kaylee> ok, so if I have some functions in the header, a new div is added to my page by an ajax call. an item in that new div has an onclick that calls the function that's been in the header since the initial loadâ€¦ why would I get a function not found?
[11:13:48] <NoiseEee> kaylee: offhand, no reason.
[11:13:52] <NoiseEee> kaylee: :)
[11:13:57] <kaylee> :/ that's what I thought too
[11:13:57] <NoiseEee> kaylee: got some code?
[11:14:37] <kaylee> maybe I've got some syntax error or html issue getting in the way
[11:15:13] <kaylee> NoiseEee: not super easily available
[11:15:19] <max|2> hello i use fadeout fadeint
[11:15:29] <max|2> how i can add framerate
[11:15:34] <NoiseEee> try console.log/debugging kaylee :\

[11:20:14] <wolfehr> how can i bind to an element changing in height? I assume I'll have to attach to window somehow?
[11:20:31] <wroathe> velcrobots: See, the problem is that at first your elements are at offsets 0 30 60 and after scrolling they're at offsets -30 0 30
[11:21:04] <kaylee> NoiseEee: see pm

[11:29:08] <max|2> how i can add framerate ?
[11:29:15] <Ansikt> does event.stopPropagation() only stop js event listeners, or does it also stop, say, the following of hyperlinks?
[11:30:00] <Ansikt> Just found a better solution, but I'm still curious.
[11:30:11] <velcrobots> wroathe: how about that scrollto plugin? http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[11:30:46] <Ansikt> NVM, just found the answer i was looking for
[11:36:44] <wroathe> velcrobots: Yup
[11:36:46] <wroathe> velcrobots: Do it
[11:37:22] <therealklanni> Can someone take a look at this and explain why $.Callbacks('unique') doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/3m7uX/
[11:40:50] <wroathe> therealklanni: The first callback adds a <div> to your existing <div> and the second callback's selector selects both divs and calls .append twice.
[11:41:36] <therealklanni> Change those to div:first
[11:41:41] <wroathe> therealklanni: http://jsfiddle.net/Qq8nu/
[11:42:00] <therealklanni> The purpose of the example was to illustrate the the "unique" flag isn't working
[11:42:06] <therealklanni> that*
[11:42:40] <sealeaf> Hey, how could I use jquery to remove all elements below a element?
[11:43:13] <sealeaf> Ie, I have <table> <tr1> <tr2> <tr3> <tr4> </table>, and I want to remove all <tr's> after <tr2>
[11:43:54] <therealklanni> wroathe: like I said, $.Callbacks('unique') isn't working
[11:44:41] <therealklanni> I assume this doesn't work with anonymous functions
[11:49:29] <max|2> how i can ad loader for img ?
[11:59:09] <hazamonzo> hmmm... hey folks... how might i find all matching elemnts instead of $(this)? --- $(this) having the same class name as the other elements i want to find
[12:00:00] <sealeaf> Hi, could someone help me debug this https://gist.github.com/4355364
[12:00:10] <sealeaf> It seems right, but I keep getting a parse error
[12:00:12] <max|2> how i can use tis
[12:00:15] <max|2> http://pastebin.com/kyXnGf3Y
[12:00:30] <wroathe> therealklanni: I had to leave for a second. Did someone else help you?
[12:00:53] <therealklanni> No
[12:00:55] <wroathe> therealklanni: The problem is it's checking to see that function pointers are unique. You're passing in anonymous functions.
[12:01:35] <therealklanni> That's what I figured
[12:01:44] <hlve> The changelog just says that they depricated a ton of stuff, and requires a backwards compatibility plugin in order for old plugins to continue to work
[12:01:45] <therealklanni> Just means I can't use anonymous functions
[12:01:47] <hlve> er
[12:01:49] <hlve> wrong paste
[12:01:55] <hlve> How would I create a function that finds and checks only 20 checkboxes on a page?
[12:02:36] <NoiseEee> break up your sentence into tasks
[12:02:40] <NoiseEee> i'm sure you can figure it out
[12:03:48] <hlve> >:/
[12:04:31] <NoiseEee> hlve: take a minute to actually think.  what's the first thing you want to do.
[12:04:53] <hlve> I was looking for an easy out because my brain already checked out for the day.
[12:05:09] <NoiseEee> oh, so easy out means you were hoping someone would write the code for you
[12:05:14] <NoiseEee> sorry, you've got the wrong channel.
[12:05:43] <danielwrobert> sealeaf: i think you have the negation "!" in the wrong place. I think it should be if (!$(this).hasClass('panel')) â€¦ you have it placed outside the statement it's trying to test
[12:06:39] <hlve> NoiseEee, I'm sorry you're being such grumpy douchebag today. I was simply asking the easiest way to do it, and sometimes there are helpful people in this channel who actually want to help instead of "you can do it".
[12:07:10] * hazamonzo gets the popcorn out
[12:07:37] <NoiseEee> hlve: i (was) more than willing to help, but not write code for you.  obviously your first task is to find checkboxes.  good luck.
[12:07:55] <hlve> No you weren't. You started off with "take a minute to think"
[12:08:09] <NoiseEee> as in slow down, break up your english sentence into code chinks
[12:08:12] <NoiseEee> chunks
[12:08:15] <hlve> No. Not at all.
[12:08:19] <hlve> You're wrong and you're rude.
[12:08:42] <hazamonzo> Let the anger flow through you
[12:08:48] <hlve> I'm fuming right now.
[12:08:56] <hlve> All through dat text stuff.
[12:09:30] <hazamonzo> thats weird, im biting my nails andf i can taste vanilla. I don;'t even like vanilla
[12:09:57] <hlve> I'm actually quite calm. I just hate unhelpful pricks who instead of helping out, come into this channel only to reply with "You can do it yourself." and "Take a second to think" like an pretension fuckwit of a human.
[12:10:15] <hlve> hazamonzo, how awkward
[12:10:32] <hlve> Maybe you've morphed into some super human that grows vanilla under his nails.
[12:10:40] <hazamonzo> hlve: I know right??
[12:11:06] <hazamonzo> hlve: but anyway, don't stress. Its Christmas. :)
[12:11:34] <hlve> More the reason to be helpful, and not reply as he did. But to each their own.
[12:11:59] <hazamonzo> Try this. Its kinda working for me. http://cenriqueortiz.com/images/ballmer-effect2-png
[12:13:01] <hazamonzo> And by working i mean i gave up about an hour ago :)
[12:14:14] <hlve> :P
[12:15:42] <hazamonzo> hlve: im thinking... (just read back and im a jquery noob) that you want to first select the checkboxes... then use the each() to set the attribute to ticked or whatever the HTML tick attribute for a checkbox is
[12:16:01] <hazamonzo> but use the index in that .each() to make sure you onlt do it to the first 20
[12:16:11] <hazamonzo> I may be wrong
[12:16:24] <hazamonzo> hlve: consult the image i posted before for verification
[12:17:35] <codepython7771> Is there a good CDN where i can pull .min.js files from ?
[12:17:40] <codepython7771> that is dependable
[12:17:49] <hazamonzo> codepython7771: google?
[12:17:56] <hazamonzo> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery-ui for example
[12:18:16] <hazamonzo> hlve: know what im saying?
[12:22:00] <codepython7771> is it safe to use github as a CDN?
[12:22:45] <codepython7771> ah! thats not a good idea
[12:24:14] <Zzaichik> you think I'd learn, I have a tendency to overcomplicate my code resulting in errors. Start out simple stupid!
[12:25:06] <NoiseEee> codepython7771: why not google?
[12:26:09] <hazamonzo> NoiseEee: you seem like a sharp chap! Say i attached a click function to a div via its class... how might i select every other div with that same class name apart from the one that was clicked? :)
[12:26:56] <hazamonzo> ooooh maybe the :not selector....
[12:27:01] <NoiseEee> indeed.
[12:27:08] <codepython7771> NoiseEee: I dont see many libraries hosted on google - bootstrap for instance
[12:27:22] <hlve> codelahoma, why do you need your CDN's all from the same place?
[12:27:40] <NoiseEee> fwiw, CDNs are better in theory than real life
[12:28:05] <NoiseEee> with so many versions of js libs in the wild, and minified/unminified, its actually *not* so likely that a user has them cached
[12:28:11] <hlve> I prefer hosting my own JS, because then I'm not ever reliant on another website or affected if/when they have any downtime. Clouds fail sometimes ;)
[12:28:16] <codepython7771> hlve: I dont. But i would like to start using CDNs. Currently i server everything from my own server.
[12:28:31] <hlve> What are you trying to accomplish by using a CDN?
[12:28:47] <codepython7771> hlve: speed up loading boostrap/jquery/...other js/css libraries
[12:28:49] <codepython7771> my server is pretty slow
[12:29:15] <hlve> Get better hosting? lol
[12:29:39] <codepython7771> its not my server. Its my customer's server
[12:30:46] <NoiseEee> codepython7771: concatenate before deploying
[12:30:57] <hlve> http://scriptsrc.net/ has a ton of CDN's. Most of which (if not all) are minified.
[12:31:31] <hazamonzo> hmmm, maybe this is too crazy? http://paste.kde.org/629468
[12:31:43] <hlve> http://www.jsdelivr.com/ too.
[12:31:54] <hazamonzo> click a .widgetbox, hide all widgetbox(s) apart from the one clicked?
[12:32:43] <codepython7771> what do these companies gain by providing free CDN storage of JS files? I'm a little skeptical of free servers- hence i ask.
[12:33:02] <hlve> Then you don't understand what a CDN is.
[12:33:03] <hlve> lol
[12:33:15] <codepython7771> hlve: indeed i dont. Please do let me know :)
[12:33:25] <codepython7771> hlve: how does jselivr let me host my files for free?
[12:33:54] <hazamonzo> Blah!!
[12:34:27] <codepython7771> they have to pay for bandwidth, dont they?
[12:34:29] <kripster> could someone tell me why my styling isn't working thanks http://jsfiddle.net/qpGWv/7/
[12:34:31] <Saaether> hazamonzo this is how id do it http://jsfiddle.net/QRKU2/4/
[12:34:53] <hazamonzo> Saaether: Thanks pal!
[12:35:29] <codepython7771> Saaether: nice
[12:36:16] <hlve> Yes they do, but because of the way the JS files are cached on their servers, there is MUCH less bandwidth used because if a user browses to site a with the CDN for jquery, and then goes to site B with the CDN, it doesn't require the browser to redownload the JS file.
[12:37:02] <Saaether> kripster whats wrong with the styling?
[12:37:20] <kripster> the css styling is doing nothing
[12:37:38] <TheTraveler|Work> Hey friends, I'm trying to create a selector that has a wildcard in the attribute name. Ex: <div data-foo-bla="whatever"> <div data-bar-bla="also-whatever"> $('[data-???-bla]');
[12:37:39] <kripster> am I using the wrong class??
[12:41:21] <Brodingo> TheTraveler|Work could probably work out a filter function for that
[12:41:56] <kripster> any ideas what i am doing wrong, saaether?
[12:43:28] <Zzaichik> kripster: yes, a quick search says there isn't a matching class to ui-controlgroup-controls
[12:43:40] <Brodingo> kripster its being overridden
[12:43:47] <Brodingo> Zzaichik its in the output
[12:43:54] <Zzaichik> yeah I found it. hehe
[12:44:12] <Brodingo> but actually its working just fine
[12:45:12] <codepython7771> hlve: thanks
[12:45:59] <Saaether> ya the height style is fine, the color style is being overridden
[12:46:18] <kripster> what do you mean is being overwritten?
[12:47:15] <Zzaichik> kripster: is this what you're wanting? http://jsfiddle.net/qpGWv/10/
[12:48:23] <kripster> yeahhh, thx zzaichick, now what do you mean the colour is being overwritten?
[12:49:28] <Zzaichik> because it was being set explicitly to a child element. So your style was being overwritten
[12:50:15] <Zzaichik> what I gave you should work though.
[12:52:39] <kripster> yeah, great thx for your help
[12:58:40] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:58:54] <popof_> Heya
[13:00:34] <db42> in jquery mobile how do i hide a div on the load itself ?
[13:32:05] <sokie> $("#mydiv").load(function(){ $(this).hide});
[13:32:11] <max|2> hi
[13:32:13] <max|2> why i can t
[13:32:14] <max|2> $("#"+boxtmp).animate( {"opacity": "0.5"}, "normal" ).delay(1000).$("#"+box).animate( {"opacity": "1"}, "normal");
[13:32:48] <NoiseEee> max|2: presumably you want a ';' and not a '.' after .delay(1000)
[13:32:49] <Brodingo> max|2 you dont chain with $ like that
[13:32:53] <dannymick> $("#"+box) isn't a method and you are trying to chain it
[13:32:59] <max|2> how i can
[13:33:00] <max|2> ?
[13:33:14] <dannymick> use a callback in animate
[13:33:35] <max|2> i can use callback with delay ?
[13:33:43] <max|2> delay(1000,callback ?
[13:34:35] <dannymick> can you throw example it in a fiddle?
[13:34:44] <max|2> $("#"+boxtmp).animate( {"opacity": "0"}, "normal" ).delay(1000,function () {
[13:34:45] <max|2>      $("#"+box).animate( {"opacity": "1"}, "normal");
[13:34:45] <max|2> }  );
[13:34:56] <max|2> no i can t :(
[13:35:15] <max|2> hmm one seconde
[13:36:17] <sokie> if you want another animate() in your callback just chain your delay there:  $("#"+box).delay(anyNumenr).animate( {"opacity": "1"}, "normal");
[13:38:07] <Terriblist> i see code

[13:46:08] <NoiseEee> i like eggs
[13:46:09] <Brodingo> max|2 you should look at using .on() so you dont have to use inline handler in your html

[13:46:23] <Brodingo> ?on @ max|2
[13:46:24] <bot-t> max|2, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:46:29] <popof_> db42: then what is it

[14:31:19] <took> hi. is there a german jquery chan somewhere?
[14:32:21] <Terriblist> hahaha
[14:32:23] <Terriblist> no
[14:32:27] <Terriblist> make your own
[14:32:38] <took> ok i ll try in english^^
[14:32:55] <Terriblist> you can call it guttenquery
[14:33:00] <max|2> :(
[14:33:16] <took> im reading the value of a text field using $('#fnord').val()
[14:33:34] <took> within a setInterval(function() {...
[14:34:03] <bil`> max|2: http://jsfiddle.net/R7AkR/
[14:34:42] <Terriblist> ok
[14:34:46] <took> if i chnage the value of the textfield to some other value than the "original" value that is had after page load, $('#fnord').val() still seems to return the "original" value
[14:34:47] <max|2> need background
[14:34:59] <max|2> and 2 div
[14:35:06] <max|2> http://jsfiddle.net/M6atN/17/
[14:36:02] <took> how to i get the actual value of a text field by it's id #fnord?
[14:36:48] <bil`> took: you had it
[14:36:57] <took> $('#fnord').val()?
[14:36:58] <bil`> $('#fnord').val() should return the value
[14:37:48] <took> it seems to return the value defined in the html code <input name="fnord" id="fnord" maxlength="19" value="2012-12-21 21:29:00" type="text">
[14:38:11] <bil`> if you type in the box the value attribute should change
[14:38:21] <took> :-?
[14:38:39] <Terriblist> yes
[14:38:43] <Terriblist> ya
[14:38:45] <took> i'll paste my code to pastebin...
[14:38:51] <Terriblist> no
[14:38:54] <Terriblist> jsfiddle
[14:38:54] <max|2> bil` what do u think ?
[14:39:55] <took> http://pastebin.com/0RkW3VqR
[14:41:24] <bil`> max|2: I think you should clarify what you want to do with sentences so we understand.
[14:41:59] <took> if i type in the ftextfile the value of $('#fnord').val() does NOT change as expected
[14:42:10] <bil`> took: in your JS console play with it
[14:42:13] <took> it seems to return the "original" value
[14:42:21] <max|2> When I hit the button, i want my background to fade to black, and then another background to fade in I made it using the fade in / fade out with jquery: but on safari, the animation is lagging you can't specify the frame rate I need to do this with animate()
[14:42:43] <bil`> took: does val() at least set the value when you try?
[14:42:57] <bil`> ex .val('foosfs')
[14:43:29] <bil`> max|2: Have you explored using CSS to animate it
[14:43:36] <max|2> yes
[14:43:40] <took> alert($('#Kalender_startzeit').val()); returns the new value as expected
[14:43:44] <max|2> can i send my site on private ?
[14:45:25] <shoky> took: then what's the problem
[14:45:29] <Terriblist> telling you this now
[14:45:34] <Terriblist> avoid if ()
[14:45:38] <Terriblist> as much as possible
[14:46:10] <Terriblist> if you can avoid if statements you will see that your logic will get better and you will have less lines of code
[14:46:22] <shoky> ;S
[14:46:44] <Terriblist> but it does take a little more effort to think through the design
[14:47:35] <took> http://pastebin.com/0RkW3VqR -> there is a div id="stechuhr" wich should be .replaceWith the numbers of hours different from the date in the textfield id="Kalender_startzeit" and now
[14:47:53] <took> it does not change if i change the date in the textfield by typing
[14:48:15] <took> it display correct if i save the new value to the database and relaod the page
[14:48:19] <shoky> if you call .val() again you'll get the new value..
[14:48:24] <bil`> took: write in the input, and then look at the attribute of the element in develop tools
[14:48:27] <bil`> does it change there?
[14:48:39] <bil`> in the html view
[14:48:52] <took> the interval-function is "ticking" (i tried to insert an "alert("foo") and it worked)
[14:50:54] <shoky> took:  $('#stechuhr').text(...)   not .replaceWith
[14:51:13] <shoky> took: .replaceWith  removes the #stechuhr element
[14:52:17] <took> :-) yes thank you shoky
[14:52:23] <took> its working now :)

[14:57:08] <shoky> ?learn
[14:57:08] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)

[14:58:40] <took> i want to call the anonymous function in my setInterval once before the interval calls it first after its first delay
[14:59:19] <took> i tried to definve a function updateStartzeit() within jQuery(function($) {...}
[14:59:44] <shoky> setInterval(updateStartzeit, 1000)
[14:59:48] <shoky> updateStartzeit();
[14:59:56] <took> setInterval was not able to call that function since it seems that it not globaly avail (but just within the jQuery(function($) {...})
[15:00:37] <shoky> but you're calling setInterval from inside there too
[15:03:53] <max|2> :'(
[15:05:11] <friskd> Hey all, how can I use the jquery ui progress bar, but extend it just a bit. I would like to have markers throughout the progress bar to indicate goal points.

[15:32:08] <Caelum> if I make an .ajax GET request with data: myobj, but I already appended some query params to the URL, will it add a new '?' to the end or detect that?
[15:35:00] <Terriblist> Caelum: you dont need ?
[15:35:27] <Terriblist> only use &
[15:35:41] <Terriblist> if you are usign string format
[15:36:56] <Caelum> Terriblist: hmm? the query string starts with '?' always
[15:37:10] <Terriblist> but you are using jquery

[15:37:16] <Terriblist> data param
[15:37:31] <Caelum> shoky: yeah I will, just haven't written the API yet :)
[15:37:44] <shoky> dont need to
[15:37:52] <Terriblist> any data params will be treated by jquery
[15:37:59] <shoky> that's what the network tab of devtools is for
[15:38:12] <Terriblist> if you manualy make string it should be

[15:48:44] <shoky> i mean

[16:16:13] <wroathe> db42: Why don't you want to use a textarea for something that is obviously a text area problem?
[16:16:19] <Terriblist> and manipulate height
[16:16:25] <wroathe> db42: Yeah, what Terriblist said.
[16:16:25] <Terriblist> as you type
[16:16:39] <wroathe> db42: But srsly, why u no text area?
[16:16:43] <Terriblist> usually you wrap all your inputs in spans
[16:16:50] <db42> hmm.. guess i would like enter to submit the form
[16:17:04] <Terriblist> that way you can style them better
[16:17:33] <Terriblist> i liek speak like dis
[16:17:40] <Terriblist> iono y freenode admin no liek it
[16:17:57] <wroathe> $('.my-textarea').on('keyup', function (e) { if(e.which === 13) this.form.submit(); });
[16:18:04] <wroathe> Or something like that
[16:18:17] <db42> yeah need to think about that, thanks
[16:18:47] <Terriblist> wait enter will submit form tho
[16:18:52] <Terriblist> by default
[16:18:57] <Terriblist> either way
[16:19:17] <Terriblist> o wait
[16:19:22] <Terriblist> nm lol
[16:19:28] <wroathe> Terriblist: not in a text area
[16:19:33] <Terriblist> i kno hahaha
[16:20:02] <wroathe> Terriblist: I hear banks pay programmers pretty well.
[16:20:34] <Terriblist> umm actually the smaller the company the bigger the pay
[16:20:44] <Terriblist> but they match
[16:22:34] <db42> how do i do an func when losing focus on an DMO element ?
[16:22:35] <db42> DOM
[16:23:41] <Eviltwin> The event is called blur
[16:24:34] <Terriblist> .blur()
[16:24:43] <wroathe> .on('blur'
[16:24:52] <wroathe> you know, in keeping with advancements in syntax
[16:24:55] <wroathe> and such
[16:24:58] <Terriblist> i kno lol
[16:25:04] <Terriblist> tell me bout it
[16:25:10] <Terriblist> whats new with .on
[16:25:13] <wroathe> Terriblist: Alright
[16:25:23] <Terriblist> why shud i use it
[16:25:37] <wroathe> Terriblist: cuz u knwo, iz cul n stuf
[16:25:45] <Terriblist> comon srsly
[16:25:53] <Terriblist> gime ur expertize
[16:26:10] <shoky> well,  .blur(fn) and .on('blur', fn)  are interchangeable
[16:26:14] <wroathe> Terriblist: arigt, iz gud tu uze bcuz is new, u know, n stuf
[16:26:22] <shoky> i'd use .blur(fn) personally
[16:26:31] <Terriblist> me too
[16:26:41] <shoky> just like before .on() came on, you could do .bind('blur',fn)
[16:26:44] <shoky> instead of .blur(fn)
[16:26:45] <Terriblist> i heard it has something to do wiht bubbling
[16:26:50] <shoky> but.. no reason to
[16:26:54] <Terriblist> or wair
[16:26:56] <shoky> it doesn't
[16:26:59] <Terriblist> im thinking of .live
[16:27:04] <shoky> that's only if you add another parameter to .on()
[16:28:20] <wroathe> .on is just the new fangled way jQuery 1.7 chose to implement binding event handlers, the purpose was to provide a consistent api for handling events
[16:28:20] <b-ot> wroathe, memorised â€œonâ€.
[16:28:32] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:28:38] <Eviltwin> rworth: ^
[16:28:52] <shoky> .on replaces .bind/.delegate/.live
[16:28:57] <wroathe> Lol, what did I just tell the bot to do?
[16:29:05] <shoky> doesnt replace .blur/.click/.change etc..
[16:29:19] <wroathe> There are some minor differences
[16:29:33] <shoky> with what?
[16:29:33] <Eviltwin> is is is is is
[16:29:44] <shoky> .is is
[16:29:44] <Eviltwin> Fixed that one
[16:29:45] <wroathe> For instance, with .hover you can pass in two callbacks -- one for mouseover and one for mouseout
[16:29:46] <shoky> .is is is
[16:29:47] <b-ot> shoky, memorised â€œisâ€.
[16:29:52] <b-ot> shoky, is
[16:29:57] <shoky> derp
[16:30:11] <shoky> wroathe: sure, .hover is not like .blur/.click/.change
[16:30:20] <Terriblist> i always naturally do things the best way
[16:30:27] <wroathe> Whereas in order to do that with .on you need to provide a handler mapping for the element
[16:30:27] <shoky> as in, it's not just a shortcut for .on(type,fn)
[16:30:28] <Terriblist> i think like a computer
[16:30:49] <wroathe> shoky: Sure, either way you get the job done.
[16:31:04] <wroathe> I just like the way .on reads :)
[16:31:20] <db42> how can i make .blur() not fire if it's because of a page change
[16:31:21] <db42> ?
[16:31:37] <shoky> ya, nothing against .on :P
[16:31:50] <Terriblist> wroathe: i actualy prefer what shoky said
[16:32:14] <wroathe> Terriblist: That's the cool thing about opinions. Everyone is allowed to have one.
[16:32:15] <Terriblist> i think on syntax is going a little backwards
[16:32:23] <Terriblist> its a bit C looking
[16:32:33] <shoky> o.O
[16:32:55] <wroathe> Terriblist: Well, when you talk to your coworkers about what an element is going to do in an event how does your conversation usually go?
[16:33:15] <wroathe> Terriblist: I think that's the best way to figure out which syntax to use.
[16:33:47] <db42> any ideas o my Q ? :)
[16:33:57] <db42> i need on a page change to unload my blur event ?
[16:34:30] <Terriblist> i helped u
[16:35:13] <db42> on page change ?
[16:35:21] <wroathe> db42: What do you mean by unload your blur event? Do you mean that the same element on a different page needs to not have that handler?
[16:35:43] <db42> i have a .blur() event, i dont want it to be called if the reason for it, is because the user is moving to another page..
[16:35:57] <Terriblist> you cant do anything on unload to take effect on the next page
[16:36:12] <Terriblist> javascript doesnt save any states
[16:36:36] <db42> on this page...
[16:36:45] <Terriblist> make a list of pages you want it on
[16:37:00] <db42> just this one page..
[16:37:11] <wroathe> db42: Can you just post code? It'll be easier to provide you with an answer.
[16:37:13] <Terriblist> so do if page == mypage
[16:37:26] <db42> the .blur() has an alert inside, i dont want alert to pop up if the reason is that the user typing in another URL
[16:37:31] <Terriblist> or beter yet if page != mypage return
[16:37:32] <db42> just if he left this input text
[16:39:42] <wroathe> db42: the alert shouldn't fire on page refresh
[16:39:53] <db42> it fires when it goes to anothe rpage
[16:40:05] <wroathe> db42: Well, like I said, post code.
[16:40:13] <wroathe> http://gist.github.com/
[16:44:45] <laidback_01> http://scsys.co.uk:8002/219997   <-- I'm getting an error from the shown script which I'm not familair with.    Why is comments_86573 an unsupported pseudo?
[16:45:13] <db42> it's easy <input type="text" id="blah"> and i have a JS code $(#'blah').blur(function() { alert('please dont show this alert when browsing to another page'); });
[16:47:56] <wroathe> db42: I've got an example here that doesn't do that when the page refreshes
[16:48:11] <db42> on iphone it does
[16:48:23] <wroathe> db42: See, there's the piece of the puzzle we didn't have.
[16:48:43] <db42> ohh, k
[16:51:01] <Terriblist> ok i gtfo nau
[16:54:57] <wroathe> db42: The reason is because the blur event fires if the keyboard hides itself.
[16:55:02] <wroathe> db42: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5937339/ipad-safari-make-keyboard-disappear
[16:55:16] <wroathe> db42: There's more information out there but this should get you looking in the right direction
[16:56:08] <db42> thanks
[16:56:33] <db42> do you have any idea why an <audio> tag wouldn't play on mobilesafari when doing .play() on it from a websocket event (and not a button) ?
[16:56:36] <db42> it works ok on regular safari..
[16:57:26] <wroathe> db42: i dont someone else might
[16:57:34] <db42> k
[17:29:15] <shoky> anybody know a simple way to get jquery-ui resizable "containment" option, but to be able to specify the actual coordinates, not just a containing element
[17:45:50] <wroathe> shoky: You could assign coordinates for the parent.
[17:49:37] <Eviltwin> shoky: Maybe if I knew what jquery-ui resizable "containtment" ment
[17:49:39] <Eviltwin> meant*
[17:50:06] <shoky> Eviltwin: http://jqueryui.com/resizable/#constrain-area
[17:50:29] <shoky> wroathe: i think i've tried that before with no success. but i don't remember why.. i'll try again ;]
[17:51:09] <Eviltwin> For resizeable or for something else?
[17:51:29] <shoky> resizable yup
[17:51:39] <Eviltwin> Hmm... this demo really isn't working well for me right now
[17:51:51] <Eviltwin> It's not actually staying within that parent
[17:51:56] <shoky> yeah it's resizing too tall
[17:52:05] <shoky> because of the title i guess
[17:52:17] <Eviltwin> Is this something that could be solved with max/min width/height?
[17:52:59] <shoky> hmm i donno, don't think i've tried using those together with resizable
[17:53:15] <shoky> if i don't get it soon i'll make a fiddle
[17:55:35] <shoky> it's annoying, cause draggable's containment option does allow arbitrary coordinates
[17:55:47] <shoky> i need both ;s
[18:11:09] <relipse> how can i get all input elements that have a "placeholder=" attribute?
[18:11:43] <relipse> AND do NOT have a title= attribute?
[18:13:41] <shoky> wroathe: awesome, got your suggestion working, put in a parent in between to serve as the resizable's "bounds". http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ExC28/1/
[18:14:16] <shoky> (i needed to be able to resize 10 pixels further than #container's bounds)
[18:14:25] <shoky> thanks
[18:15:28] <monk3y> relipse: maybe this? $('[placeholder][title]:not()').blah()
[18:16:04] <monk3y> relipse: (from here - http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/)
[18:16:59] <xenome> i'm trying to change the style of buttons and only seem able to figure it out via js using ('#id').children().children() references vice using straight CSS
[18:17:05] <xenome> with JQM
[18:17:28] <xenome> anyone know a good way to reference the id?
[18:19:11] <relipse> monk3y: ok looking into it
[18:19:54] <shoky> relipse: $('[placeholder]:not([title])')
[18:20:34] <relipse> shoky: perfect, thanks
[18:24:05] <monk3y> shoky: thanks for the alles-oop.  And by alles-oop; I mean absolute correction.
[18:24:24] <relipse> yeah it worked great, check it out: $('[placeholder]:not([title])').each(function(index, Element){ $(Element).attr('title', $(Element).attr('placeholder'))});
[18:24:32] <relipse> is there a better way of doing that?
[18:25:32] <monk3y> So you wanna iterate through all elements with placeholder=* but not title=*, and create title and copy placeholder into it?
[18:25:42] <relipse> exactly!
[18:25:53] <relipse> because sometimes the user forgets what field he is typing into
[18:26:26] <monk3y> And .. how  . . ... does this alleviate that?
[18:27:05] <relipse> the title pop up
[18:27:12] <relipse> and shows him what the field is
[18:37:24] <monk3y> relipse: what triggers this script to run?  What event?
[18:47:01] <vali> hi, anyone been using Raphael ?
[18:50:41] <wroathe> vali: I have
[18:50:44] <wroathe> vali: What's up?
[18:51:14] <wroathe> vali: Although I'd definitely recommend Leonardo.
[18:53:43] <vali> I want to make some circle borders like here: http://a.imageshack.us/img818/2617/shot0i.jpg
[18:54:29] <vali> the territory ranges.... can't figure that part out (and I can change to Leonardo/whatever if it works in all browsers, and can add jquery events to some shapes (like the stars))
[18:54:43] <vali> any ideas?
[18:54:50] <wroathe> vali: I was being sarcastic about Leonardo.
[18:55:11] <wroathe> vali: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles
[18:56:04] <wroathe> vali: Anyway, you're looking for fill: http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.attr
[18:56:16] <wroathe> fill-opacity I mean
[18:56:18] <vali> i need tr half transparent
[18:56:34] <vali> and when they meet up, the transpareny gets merged (so it's not the same any more)
[18:56:59] <vali> unless i'm missing something basic somehere...
[18:57:15] <wroathe> vali: You mean you'd like a 50% of one color to mix with 50% of another color and whatever background they are on?
[18:57:21] <wroathe> fill-opacity
[18:57:38] <vali> say 50%red with 50% red, when they meet up, it makes 75% red in the area where they touch
[18:57:44] <vali> i need it to stay 50%
[18:59:03] <vali> here>> http://jsfiddle.net/QQaLf/2/
[18:59:19] <vali> see the part where both intersect, i need that to be the same color
[19:05:31] <wroathe> vali: So what you actually need is a lighter color
[19:05:46] <wroathe> 100% of a lighter color
[19:05:57] <vali> well, this is on a background image :p
[19:06:03] <vali> so i can't make it mate
[19:06:14] <wroathe> Got a demo I can look at?
[19:06:21] <vali> and I actually want 2 things, second beeing just the borders
[19:06:23] <vali> >>  http://jsfiddle.net/QQaLf/2/
[19:06:26] <vali> you see the url?
[19:06:36] <vali> or you want the actual demo?
[19:09:01] <wroathe> vali: So if I'm understanding you you'd like for opacity to not blend colors
[19:09:24] <vali> wroathe: exactly, but while beeing transparent (since this is set on a background image)
[19:09:35] <wroathe> vali: Can I see the actual demo?
[19:10:06] <vali> looking to see how make xampp work on ip instead of localhost only...
[19:10:21] <wroathe> vali: Don't worry about it
[19:10:39] <wroathe> vali: You're attacking it wrong, opacity going to do that no matter what you do
[19:10:53] <wroathe> vali: The best thing to do is to manually set colors at 100% in that situation
[19:13:13] <vali> so... i create 2 papers, one with 100% and set the css opacity to 50%, that's not that retarded right?
[19:14:06] <wroathe> vali: What's retarded is expecting two objects with sub 100% opacity not to blend colors.
[19:15:16] <vali> i end up having 9 layers...
[19:18:27] <vali> ok, now the second part: http://jsfiddle.net/QQaLf/3/ any way I can get ONLY the outside borders? (so i don't get those intersecting ones)
[19:23:42] <wroathe> vali: Can't do that by default with raphael. You'll have to implement your own path intersection algorithm.
[19:24:14] <wroathe> vali: http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Raphael.pathIntersection
[19:24:19] <wroathe> That should help.
[19:25:21] <vali> hm... checking it
[19:29:37] <vali> hm.. not sure i get it... as in get how to use this (say I have 100 circles, i want the outer borders only...)
[20:58:14] <codepython777> Has anyone used chai and QUnit both? Are these for different things, or can they both be used to do unit testing in JS?
[21:01:12] <shoky> gahh
[21:01:41] <shoky> wroathe this is the reason why nothing i do with that resizable eventually works :( http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3815
[21:01:53] <shoky> not that you care, just ranting.
[21:50:39] <popof_> in an input response, can I store an object / associative array in the value: or does it have to be a string?
[21:52:03] <popof_> i.e label is "Florida, United States" value is { c: 'US' , state:'FL' }
[22:53:51] <gates> hi
[22:54:10] <popof_> howdy
[22:54:22] <gates> I have an array (in php) of 20 Images and Captions
[22:54:31] <gates> I'd like to scroll throw them, fade in / fade out auto
[22:54:44] <gates> and then when the 21st image is loaded it ajax a call for 20 more images
[22:55:11] <gates> the images auto progress and pause on hover, as well are clickable to a link thats also in the array
[22:55:34] <gates> I think I kind of get it but I am unsure the best way to make such a thing
[22:56:43] <popof_> gates: theres things like $.getJSON and $.ajax at your disposal... and lots of animations and slide toggles and such within jquery. just have a look around the docs
[23:00:00] <gates> Would I setup all 20 objects
[23:00:04] <gates> and then sort through them
[23:00:12] <gates> and then ajax load a new set of 20 objects
[23:01:23] <popof_> gates: sure
[23:01:29] <popof_> gates: so whats the question :P
[23:01:39] <popof_> oh
[23:01:44] <popof_> I misread WOuld as well
[23:01:46] <popof_> disregard.
[23:01:47] <popof_> um
[23:01:58] <gates> like html objects, image and text
[23:02:13] <popof_> yeah, its up  to you to decide the balance between request frequency and request size
[23:02:38] <popof_> odds are you won't have to worry about being ultra efficient anyway unless you have an important site
[23:02:58] <foobler> could anyone give a look over my tweet-joining script to tell why it's not working? the first two seem to be getting joined, but the third is getting left out for some reason... http://jsbin.com/oyepem/7/edit
[23:03:04] <popof_> you can use a serverside code to dump a format you like (e.g. json) and get that via jquery
[23:03:16] <gates> well its all coming from php
[23:03:23] <popof_> right but its going to jquery
[23:03:25] <gates> so i can json it to an array
[23:03:32] <popof_> other way around you mean
[23:03:37] <gates> and then have it sort the array
[23:03:43] <gates> then request more
[23:04:28] <popof_> gates: still not sure where your question is
[23:30:55] <ussher_> I found this function on stackoverflow that allows location of the next element in the dom just with its class: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12873027/jquery-forget-the-dom-structure-just-find-the-next-element-with-this-class#answer-12873187
[23:31:18] <ussher_> but its failing with "too much recursion" when the next element isnt there.  how can i stop the level of recursion
[23:32:31] <ussher_> even setting up an example in jsfiddle will crash the browser.
[23:35:24] <ussher_> the goal is to get the next ID by finding the next element with a specific class.  "find class, retrieve ID"  if there is any way to do that, love to know.
