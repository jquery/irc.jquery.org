[00:02:21] <Cork> djQuery: i would prob go with an empty mark instead of an x
[00:02:25] <Cork> but the rest looks lice
[00:02:26] <Cork> *nice
[00:02:41] <djQuery> Cork: couldnt find one
[00:05:40] <Cork> djQuery: add a simple css rule like .ui-menu-hide-icon .ui-icon { display: none; }
[00:05:54] <Cork> djQuery: and toggle that class
[00:06:10] <Cork> opps that doesn't work
[00:06:26] <djQuery> Cork: that would shift the text
[00:07:02] <djQuery> would be nice if the first one was a blank instead of the carat
[00:07:20] <Cork> djQuery: it shouldn't
[00:07:31] <Cork> .menu-item a has padding-left: 2em;
[00:08:22] <Cork> djQuery: ui-icon is absolute positioned
[00:09:30] <Cork> djQuery: the css rule should be .ui-menu-hide-icon .ui-icon { display: none; } .ui-menu-hide-icon .ui-menu-icon { display: block; }
[00:10:03] <Cork> i didn't use :not as ie isn't too found about it
[00:12:56] <Demia> Cork: aye, but it's IE so no one cares.
[00:14:16] <Cork> Demia: ie is much of the point of jquery actually
[00:16:27] <Demia> Cork: hmm I have never thought about that though I see how it could be true. I despise IE with all my heart and refuse to develop for it unless I am being paid to do so (and it isn't easy to get me to do it)
[00:17:24] <Cork> Demia: if you ever make a page that aims to get any amount of visitors, writing for ie isn't something you can not do
[00:17:37] <Cork> ignoring older ie is another thing
[00:17:43] <Cork> but ie7+ isn't really posible
[00:19:05] <Demia> Cork: I disagree with that getting visitors part, a majority of people use real browsers now. I test most things I develop in ie8 or ie9 but if something is wrong I usually avoid giving a crap.
[00:19:28] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, adding chrome frame and a nice message seems like a solution
[00:19:29] <Demia> most of the time it works just fine though.
[00:19:47] <blackspotwiggins> also yeah, people tend to use real browsers
[00:20:08] <blackspotwiggins> when given the chance (not at corporate dinosaur slave cubicle)
[00:22:27] <Demia> blackspotwiggins: that is a very good point some people do not have the option to use a real browser. but in that environment they usually cannot get to anything I would develop that I am not being paid for anyway, so it all works out.
[00:23:05] <blackspotwiggins> yeah thats reasonable
[00:23:17] <blackspotwiggins> same for me actually, i dont care about older ies
[00:23:27] <blackspotwiggins> because target audience probably wont use it anyway
[00:24:11] <Demia> blackspotwiggins: exactly. then again a few years ago a company paid me to develop a website that HAD to work in ie6, that was a bloody nightmare.. they paid me well though so it was worth it.
[00:41:35] <Murugaratham> is it possible to log jquery errors on the server side without writing another script on the server end?
[00:42:31] <blackspotwiggins> Murugaratham, you understand the impossibility of that question?
[00:43:07] <Murugaratham> ya, just thinking whether is it possible at all
[00:47:19] <blackspotwiggins> is it possible to create a program without writing code?
[00:47:22] <blackspotwiggins> you tell me
[00:47:48] <SoulRaven> hi
[00:48:04] <Demia> blackspotwiggins: thank you for the laugh sir, it was much needed.
[00:48:06] <SoulRaven> any one use dataTable?
[00:48:12] <SoulRaven> http://www.datatables.net
[00:49:07] <SoulRaven> i want to position the buttons from tabletools in another position on the table, but i don't know
[00:49:35] <SoulRaven> in tutorial is used something like "sDom": 'T<"clear">lfrtip',
[00:49:57] <SoulRaven> where i find more DOM elements like lfrtip
[00:51:06] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins++
[00:51:42] <gnarf> SoulRaven: that looks like some arcane shit there
[00:53:52] <SoulRaven> :(
[00:54:18] <SoulRaven> i don't know where to look for more DOM elemnts
[01:01:38] <dirkpennings> guys, what's the best way to set a checkbox checked? with attr('checked',true) or attr('checked','checked') ? (or something completely different?)
[01:03:37] <Demia> dirkpennings: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/426258/how-do-i-check-a-checkbox-with-jquery-or-javascript
[01:04:09] <Demia> dirkpennings: there isn't really a best way its all about what works in the most browsers and all that jazz.

[01:10:34] <krz> how do i get the first 3 characters from 'foobar' ?
[01:10:36] <krz> so 'foo'
[01:10:58] <Cork> ?mdc string @ krz
[01:11:12] <krz> ?
[01:11:20] <Cork> ah.. the bot is down
[01:11:32] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
[01:11:53] <krz> so vanilla js
[01:11:59] <krz> no jquery way of doing this?
[01:12:01] <Cork> ya
[01:12:11] <Cork> .splice would be what your looking for

[01:12:32] <krz> thanks
[01:12:43] <na3r> hi guys
[01:13:05] <na3r> how can i increase z-index with jquery ?
[01:13:26] <Cork> krz: hmm substr migh actually fitt even better
[01:13:44] <Cork> na3r: css('z-index', '<your new index>')
[01:14:30] <na3r> Cork, i want increase it . like this css('z-index', '+=10')
[01:14:39] <na3r> but it doesn;t work
[01:14:48] <JKarsrud> do it before you set the CSS then?
[01:14:52] <Cork> ya as that would set z-index to +=10
[01:15:01] <JKarsrud> read, increase, and set?
[01:15:35] <Cork> na3r: css('z-index', css('z-index')+1)
[01:16:07] <na3r> Cork, tnx. i got it
[01:17:22] <krz> Cork: slice(0,3) does it fine
[01:18:03] <Cork> krz: yup

[01:20:46] <Demia> dirkpennings: you are most welcome.
[01:22:05] <nostar> .live() catches all the dynamically added links, added with .html(), but i cant get the class or id, any attributes via .attr() on any later added elements

[01:30:42] <is_null> hi all, any idea why my plugin won't load ? http://jsfiddle.net/MA4b7/
[01:31:19] <is_null> ahhh nvm some stupid typo
[01:58:42] <gnarf> ?ping
[01:58:45] <gnarf> boo
[01:59:11] <gnarf> nostar: can you paste some JS Code on like jsfiddle.net or somethin?
[02:12:47] <DragonL> hi all, how do I detect when dynamically loaded css is ready? I don't want to resort to setTimeout :/
[02:14:09] <Aamir> DragonL:  append it to head it will apply soon its loaded so why you want to check its ready state?
[02:14:29] <Aamir> ?theme switcher @DragonL
[02:14:30] <DragonL> Aamir: I want to check the colors in the css and print them on the page
[02:15:04] <Aamir> DragonL:  you want to search the content of the css file?
[02:15:15] <DragonL> Aamir, yes basically
[02:15:17] <Aamir> use ajax?
[02:15:33] <DragonL> that's not a bad idea actually
[02:15:41] <Aamir> lol :P
[02:15:55] <DragonL> I wasn't thinking outside the box.... thanks ;)
[02:16:10] <Aamir> I know, it happen to me all the time :P
[02:22:18] <SoulRaven> anyone use dataTables plugin?
[02:22:25] <SoulRaven> http://www.datatables.net
[02:25:36] <SoulRaven> i nead some info regarding tableTools
[02:28:43] <hExDj> I have a radio button group, I need to know if no value has been checked
[02:28:46] <hExDj> how can I do this?
[02:29:39] <jasl> Can't you check to see if $('$butt').val() is empty, undefined or not set?
[02:30:05] <hExDj> how do I do that?
[02:30:32] <hExDj> if ($('butt').val() != "") ?
[02:30:40] <jasl> I'd first do a console.log($('#butt').val())
[02:31:00] <jasl> See what the value is when the buttons aren't set.
[02:31:38] <hExDj> ok
[02:31:54] <jasl> You are using firebug, right?
[02:33:22] <hExDj> yeah
[02:33:30] <jasl> Great.
[02:33:31] <Aamir> hExDj:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/ZKLbK/
[02:33:40] <hExDj> it is taking the first value of the first radio button
[02:33:44] <hExDj> even though it's not checked
[02:35:25] <Aamir> hExDj:  click the radio button
[02:35:46] <Aamir> try click 2nd
[02:35:52] <Aamir> clicking*
[02:36:29] <jasl> Add a hidden button as the first in the list.
[02:36:54] <jasl> If val is first then none have been clicked.
[02:37:16] <hExDj> jasl: u mean hidden with css?
[02:37:21] <hExDj> or a hidden field?
[02:37:21] <jasl> Right
[02:37:29] <jasl> CSS display:none
[02:37:56] <jasl> Since it can't be seen, it won't be selected.
[02:38:07] <hExDj> okay
[02:38:31] <hExDj> jasl: I just did another test and when no radio is checked
[02:38:35] <hExDj> it is 'undefined'
[02:38:43] <hExDj> I read it wrong earlier
[02:38:46] <jasl> OK test for that.
[02:39:06] <jasl> if (...==undefined)
[02:39:22] <jasl> Not in quotes.
[02:39:56] <hExDj> ah ok, that was my next question :)
[02:40:18] <jasl> undefined is a reserved word in JS
[02:40:52] <hExDj> makes sense
[02:40:53] <jasl> just like true, false etc.  Just another value.
[02:41:00] <hExDj> works perfectly! thanks so much!
[02:41:21] <jasl> Glad to be able to help.
[02:41:25] <fleetfox> Hello. How to select specific element from element if i have it selected by .parent()
[02:41:25] <jayar> can you preload images with jQuery?
[02:41:30] <Anticom> hi all
[02:42:10] <fleetfox> Can i chain selector after .parent() or something
[02:43:41] <fleetfox> oh nvm
[02:50:17] <GreyTrilby> mornin' all - just wondering if I can get a little help with some jquery functions... I'm being told that a variable isn't defined, even when it is (in a previous function) - I suspect I'm missing something in nesting functions
[02:50:47] <GreyTrilby> basically I want one of my divs to fill the height of the window (while resizing images to fit)
[02:50:58] <GreyTrilby> it works, pretty much, but I'm trying to get it all sorted into functions
[02:51:31] <GreyTrilby> The code is here - basically I'm being told by firebug that "divHeight" doesn't exist - any help would be much appreciated! http://jsfiddle.net/Nf4d5/
[02:53:36] <GreyTrilby> The error is being thrown by the second line of function "divFit()"
[02:54:45] * GreyTrilby looks around at the chilling silence, shivering
[02:56:42] <edzjins> hi everyone
[02:57:16] <GreyTrilby> hi edz
[02:57:23] <GreyTrilby> brb - making breakfast!
[03:00:25] <edzjins> i've got an issue. i've made a simple slideshow plugin, which basically just fades to the next slide every 5 seconds. the thing i need to do now is to somehow add the forward/next buttons, so you can navigate through it, but keeping the auto slide change functionality.
[03:00:54] <edzjins> my problem now is that i can't find a way to break my infinite loop with a mouse click or something.
[03:02:12] <edzjins> anybody has been doing something like this before?
[03:02:15] <GreyTrilby> that's a bit above my level I'm afraid!
[03:02:28] <GreyTrilby> I just use the slides.js plugin - why reinvent the wheel!
[03:03:07] <GreyTrilby> ooh - another BE user...
[03:03:43] <edzjins> i'm trying to learn something new, i know i can find something like that already :)
[03:04:11] <Me-Selfe> edzjins: what kind of loop do you have?
[03:04:41] <Aamir> ?next @edzjins
[03:04:46] <Aamir> and prev
[03:04:52] <Aamir> ahh bot-t :/
[03:05:21] <GreyTrilby> Aamir - you any good wih functions?
[03:05:57] <Aamir> no
[03:07:14] <GreyTrilby> bummer!
[03:09:19] <Shazer2> ?next @ edzjins
[03:09:24] <Shazer2> erm
[03:09:39] <Puck`> look at that, a helper? :O
[03:11:29] <GreyTrilby> hehe
[03:11:30] <edzjins> i'll link you to an example of what i've got now
[03:11:53] <gnarf> edzjins: use setTimeout()'s and clearTimeout()s
[03:12:10] <gnarf> the next/prev buttons clear the main timeout and run the anim
[03:12:13] <gnarf> then set a fresh one
[03:12:28] <edzjins> http://www.restorans.lv/en/menu/dinner_menu/
[03:12:33] <edzjins> here's what i've got..
[03:12:50] <gnarf> store the "advancing" timeout in a variable in a wide enough scope and it wont matter
[03:13:07] <edzjins> gnarf: sounds good enough to test it..
[03:13:43] <edzjins> the thing i'm afraid of is that i'll have to remake it totally to add these functions, but as i already have the basic things written, it won't be hard..
[03:14:02] <gnarf> well you should already have the "next" function written
[03:14:07] <gnarf> you just need to make it go backwards
[03:14:08] <gnarf> :)
[03:14:26] <GreyTrilby> gnarf - you seem wise in the ways of the force - could you give me a quick hand with a function issue? I think I'm just being stupid (read "ignorant")
[03:15:12] <gnarf> GreyTrilby: post some code
[03:15:12] <elliotf> What would be the best way to determine if a given dom element is the last child of its parent?
[03:15:19] <gnarf> if bot-t were here
[03:15:22] <gnarf> I'd say "?ask"
[03:15:57] <GreyTrilby>  http://jsfiddle.net/Nf4d5/ - i've got a function that defines a bunch of variables, but when I call that function within another (to utilise said variables) it says the variable is undefined...
[03:16:03] <elliotf> dom_elem.hasClass(':last-child') doesn't seem to work
[03:16:07] <edzjins> elliotf: $("parent child:last-child");
[03:16:12] <gnarf> variables are scoped to their containing function GreyTrilby
[03:16:22] <gnarf> i.e. those variables are only defined in that function
[03:16:38] <elliotf> edzjins: would I have to interpolate the child dom element somehow, though?
[03:16:45] <GreyTrilby> so if I want to use a DOM-wide variable (i.e. window.width) I have to define it every time?
[03:16:54] <gnarf> GreyTrilby: F globals
[03:16:54] <elliotf> as in, I have a dom element, and I want to know if it's the last child.
[03:17:04] <gnarf> GreyTrilby: enclose your code in a closure, and put the vars there
[03:17:08] <elliotf> hrm, grab the parent's last child and do a comparison, I guess.
[03:17:16] <GreyTrilby> ooh - not used globals before
[03:17:22] * GreyTrilby panics and runs off to google
[03:17:23] <gnarf> globals suck
[03:17:27] <gnarf> i.e. F em
[03:17:38] <edzjins> well, if you have your DOM element in a variable, then you can just compare it to $("parent child:last-child")
[03:17:39] <edzjins> like
[03:17:43] <gnarf> perhaps "eff" or just "fuck" globals ;)
[03:17:48] <edzjins> var x = $("your-element");
[03:17:49] <GreyTrilby> lol
[03:18:04] <GreyTrilby> is that the only way to do it?
[03:18:08] <edzjins> if(x == $("parent child:last-child") { do something }
[03:18:26] <edzjins> or even better
[03:18:44] <GreyTrilby> ahh - ok
[03:18:47] <edzjins> if(x == x.children("child:last-child");
[03:18:50] <elliotf> edzjins: ah, okay...  I was going to try x.parent().child(':last-child');
[03:18:59] <elliotf> edzjins: but x is the child.... ?
[03:19:06] <edzjins> x is your DOM element
[03:19:15] <elliotf> edzjins: yes, the child DOM element.
[03:19:18] <edzjins> x.parent() gets us to its parent element
[03:19:21] <gnarf> GreyTrilby: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[03:19:22] <elliotf> yez
[03:19:23] <elliotf> yes...
[03:19:34] <elliotf> edzjins: I want to know if x is the last child of its parent
[03:19:35] <gnarf> http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter2.html
[03:19:50] <edzjins> x.parent().children("item:last-child") gets the last child of your DOM elements parent
[03:20:05] <edzjins> damn, all this looks kinda messy lol
[03:20:05] <elliotf> edzjins: which I should be able to compare against x, no?
[03:20:18] <elliotf> edzjins: hence why I was asking the question in here.  :)
[03:20:23] <gnarf> edzjins: um
[03:20:30] <edzjins> you can compare x.parent().children("item:last-child") to x
[03:20:32] <gnarf> x.nextAll("item").last()
[03:20:45] <GreyTrilby>  cheers gnarf - think I'm going to have to rework this a bit!
[03:20:47] <edzjins> if it's true, then your DOM element is the last child of its parent
[03:21:01] <gnarf> x.is(":last-child")
[03:21:24] <elliotf> gnarf: pretty..  I'll try that.
[03:21:55] <elliotf> gnarf: you are a beautiful being. thank you.
[03:21:57] <gnarf> !x.nextAll().length
[03:22:05] <gnarf> or even
[03:22:08] <gnarf> !x.next()
[03:22:10] <gnarf> !x.next().length
[03:22:20] <elliotf> ah, true..  true...
[03:22:45] <elliotf> edzjins: better solutions...
[03:22:53] <elliotf> edzjins, gnarf : thank you both very much!
[03:23:01] <gnarf> np
[03:23:02] <edzjins> hehe
[03:23:06] <elliotf> going with x.is(':last-child')
[03:23:11] <edzjins> well, it's indeed shorter
[03:23:16] <elliotf> as it's the most communicative.
[03:23:19] <gnarf> yeah, that reads very nicely
[03:23:20] <gnarf> :)
[03:23:23] <elliotf> :)
[03:23:35] <gnarf> kinda slow in older browsers tho
[03:23:35] <edzjins> sorry, i'm hungover today, forgot about $.is() ;D
[03:23:47] <gnarf> !x.next().length is gonna be the cross-browser fastest
[03:23:50] <elliotf> edzjins: you have absolutely no reason to apologize.    I appreciate your help
[03:24:06] <edzjins> you're welcome
[03:24:07] <elliotf> must..  not...  pre-optimize...
[03:24:14] <gnarf> elliotf: :)
[03:25:53] <edzjins> gnarf: well, timeouts are just fine i guess, but i'm wondering how do i control it
[03:26:14] <edzjins> when i initialize the function, i set a timeout of 5 seconds (5000ms)
[03:26:52] <edzjins> huh, it will take a total remake because now i'm using delay() and doing everything in the callback
[03:27:35] <edzjins> i'm wondering how to make it wait for the timeout AND wait for prev/next buttons to be clicked in the same time
[03:28:25] <elliotf> edzjins: as in, reset the timer if additional prev/next buttons are hit?
[03:29:00] <elliotf> which delay() doesn't allow..
[03:29:04] <edzjins> well yes. i don't picture how i should write that
[03:29:11] <edzjins> true, delay() doesn't care what you do
[03:29:17] <elliotf> edzjins: sounds like a standard settimeout, no?
[03:29:21] <edzjins> i tried it before, but it worked quite stupid
[03:29:30] <edzjins> yes, a standart settimeout
[03:30:20] <edzjins> but, when a button (prev/next) is clicked, the timeout is unset and it fades to the next pic
[03:30:41] <elliotf> edzjins: as in, it changes immediately rather than waiting for the timeout?
[03:30:48] <edzjins> or, if i click on a navigation item in the gallery (you should have seen it in the example i linked you to), goes to that picture
[03:30:57] <edzjins> of course changes immediately
[03:31:04] <gnarf> edzjins: var timer; function setTimer() { timer = setTimeout( advance, 5000 ); }; function advance() { // do your advance logic; setTimer() }  $("button").click(function() { clearTimeout( timer); advance(); });
[03:31:07] <edzjins> that's the reason why there are controls needed at all
[03:31:09] <elliotf> edzjins: I showed up after you posted a url
[03:31:15] <gnarf> etc
[03:31:45] * elliotf agrees
[03:31:53] <edzjins> i hope you've had your breakfast elliotf
[03:32:08] <edzjins> because the example is tasty ;D
[03:32:10] <edzjins> http://www.restorans.lv/lv/edienkarte/vakara/
[03:32:13] <edzjins> oops
[03:32:17] <elliotf> edzjins: heh..  nope..  it's 3:30am here
[03:32:32] <edzjins> lol, 1:30 PM here ;D
[03:32:36] <elliotf> .lv == latvia?
[03:32:40] <gnarf> 5:30am
[03:32:40] <edzjins> yes
[03:32:51] <elliotf> gnarf: central, eh?
[03:32:58] <gnarf> yup
[03:33:20] <elliotf> edzjins: I'm not seeing how to skip to the next pic..  or is that what you're trying to add?
[03:33:39] <edzjins> yes, it's what i'm trying to add
[03:33:51] <elliotf> wow, it's fun to watch the opacity go crazy in the developer console in chrome.
[03:33:56] <elliotf> (during transition)
[03:41:40] <edzjins> hehe
[03:42:41] <silv3r_m00n> for an input tag I want to setup a function as its keyup handler such that it executes before anyother keyup handler , is that possible ?
[03:44:14] <guy> is this a valid syntax? [..].bind('touch', $.throttle(1200, $.fn.center(1))); the $.fn.center(1) part; can a parameter be passed like this in such context?
[03:45:58] <Putr> hey ppl. I have a link that downloads an attachmet (so it does not browse away from the site). How would i go about reloading the site after you have downloaded the attachemnt
[03:48:26] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[03:48:28] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[03:48:48] <gnarf> guy: not really
[03:49:17] <gnarf> calling $.fn.anything() is strange at best
[03:49:22] <jayar> Putr: stateChange() function maybe?
[03:49:46] <gnarf> $.fn is usually meant to be "prototype" applied to DOM selections... i.e. $.fn.next -> $("something").next()
[03:49:56] <gnarf> also
[03:50:10] <gnarf> $.throttle (the ben alman plugin) expects a function as its second parameter
[03:50:17] <gnarf> not the result of executing that function
[03:50:20] <guy> gnarf: what's the closest alternative? function(){ $(this).foo( 'param' ) } then?
[03:50:27] <gnarf> guy: yes
[03:50:35] <gnarf> wrap it in closure
[03:51:46] <gnarf> although $(this) is wrong
[03:51:50] <gnarf> most likely
[03:52:21] <gnarf> ben is a smart guy tho, so it probably passes context through
[03:52:28] <gnarf> so you might be able to ignore that warning
[03:52:45] <gnarf> just feels like a bad spot for a $(this)
[03:53:15] <guy> gnarf: I've checked that, he did pass the context. The other thing: so generally I should use $.fn.extend({}) only for prototype functions? that is, that will be applied on [selector].function()?
[03:53:32] <gnarf> guy: yes
[03:53:58] <gnarf> if its a "static" function, just define it in your own closure or whatever
[03:54:05] <gnarf> no reason to even store it on $
[03:54:13] <guy> ok, would you mind looking at this code then. Where should I put search: function()?
[03:54:13] <guy> http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/public/js/jquery.tab-flow.1.0.js
[03:54:14] <gnarf> unless you need it everywhere
[03:54:27] <guy> it doesn't use $(this) anywhere inside it.
[03:54:45] <guy> so anywhere in $(function () {})?
[03:55:10] <gnarf> basicaly
[03:55:22] <gnarf> just "function search(.......)
[03:55:34] <gnarf> or maybe even on your $.hp
[03:55:46] <gnarf> yeah, calling $.fn.zoom()
[03:55:47] <gnarf> and shit
[03:55:58] <gnarf> horrible practice
[03:56:08] <guy> I see. Thank you for making this clear.
[03:56:15] <gnarf> also
[03:56:20] <Kreantos> hi
[03:56:20] <gnarf> no reason to $(this) inside of a $.fn
[03:56:27] <gnarf> "this" is already a jQuery
[03:56:43] <gnarf> so you can just this.hide() etc
[03:57:00] <Kreantos> is it possible to append rules by css classes on jquery validate?
[03:57:53] <is_null> hi all, why is it impossible to get the element my extension is being invoked on, except the first time ? poc: http://jsfiddle.net/kFnvF/
[03:58:56] <gnarf> is_null: i get the feeling the document.write() deleted your <div>
[03:59:15] <gnarf> is_null: http://jsfiddle.net/kFnvF/1/
[03:59:27] <gnarf> try console.log() and firebug or chrome devtools?
[04:00:13] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/053K0e0E2G0b1e3z2S1R
[04:00:25] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/kFnvF/2/
[04:00:27] <is_null> right, thanks
[04:00:35] <guy> gnarf: fn is not reserved or anything, right? I can store functions in hp object, under fn object. Like this: $.hp.fn.search = function(){}.
[04:00:50] <gnarf> guy you could
[04:00:59] <gnarf> but $.fn === $.prototype
[04:01:05] <gnarf> its kinda a convention in jQuery
[04:01:23] <gnarf> i would almost think $.hp.helpers.search()
[04:01:28] <gnarf> or something like that is better
[04:01:31] <guy> but $.hp.fn will have no relation with $.fn;?
[04:01:43] <guy> naturally.
[04:01:49] <gnarf> guy: very true, aside from the fact that they share "fn"
[04:02:10] <gnarf> and your brain, when reading it should translate something.fn into something.prototype if you spend any time working in jQuery
[04:02:46] <gnarf> call it unicorns.search if you want
[04:02:53] <gnarf> in the end
[04:02:59] <gnarf> yer the one whos gonna be using it
[04:04:10] <is_null> which brings us to my second question: how to maintain a registry inside my extension ? i've tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/kFnvF/1/ but hello.registry is being reset at each call... any recommendation ?
[04:04:53] <is_null> oops, update: http://jsfiddle.net/kFnvF/3/
[04:05:42] <gnarf> is_null: "this" is not "hello"
[04:05:51] <gnarf> it is $("#a1")
[04:06:06] <gnarf> which $("#a1") !== $("#a1");
[04:06:14] <gnarf> $.fn.hello.registry
[04:07:28] <is_null> brillant!! thanks again gnarf
[04:07:48] <guy> variables in .merge are passed by reference?
[04:07:57] <gnarf> guy: wtf is .merge ?
[04:08:01] <guy> so there is no point in catching return value for:
[04:08:02] <guy> $.merge($.hp.videos, data.feed.entry);
[04:08:11] <gnarf> ?jQuery.merge
[04:08:12] <bot-t> jQuery.merge(first, second): Merge the contents of two arrays together into the first array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[04:08:20] <gnarf> wow
[04:08:26] <gnarf> never seen that function
[04:08:27] <gnarf> lol
[04:08:28] <Me-Selfe> guy: guess the result is not important
[04:08:59] <gnarf> guy: all objects (which is pretty much everything in JS) are "passed by reference"
[04:09:31] <gnarf> please go into a little more detail about the question if you want a more definate answer
[04:09:45] <guy> gnarf: that's fine enough for now.
[04:09:47] <guy> uh. need to take a break. coffee-launch.
[04:39:02] <dmarkey> is there an option for autocomplete to show results without haveing to start typing? just once it has focus?
[04:39:47] <coldhead> yes, use a <select> menu :P
[04:40:03] <Woet> dmarkey: $("#input").focus(function(){ $("#input").autocomplete("search", 0); });
[04:40:08] <Woet> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#method-search
[04:40:17] <Woet> .autocomplete( "search" , [value] )
[04:40:18] <Woet> Triggers a search event, which, when data is available, then will display the suggestions; can be used by a selectbox-like button to open the suggestions when clicked. If no value argument is specified, the current input's value is used. Can be called with an empty string and minLength: 0 to display all items.
[04:41:05] <dmarkey> Woet: thanks a lot
[04:42:09] <Woet> dmarkey: i'm sorry, $("#input").focus(function(){ $("#input").autocomplete("search", ""); }); should be it
[04:42:18] <Woet> and minLength: 0 where you initialize it
[04:42:28] <dmarkey> cool
[04:42:42] <gnarf> Woet: sigh @ the $("#input") twice
[04:42:55] <Woet> dmarkey: i'm sorry, $("#input").focus(function(){ $(this).autocomplete("search", ""); }); should be it
[04:43:07] * Woet glares at gnarf
[04:43:08] <gnarf> Woet: sigh at the $(this) :)
[04:43:20] <Woet> dmarkey: gnarf has a better idea, he'll explain it right now
[04:43:24] <Woet> go!
[04:43:27] <gnarf> var input = $("#input").focus(function() { focus....
[04:43:33] <gnarf> var input = $("#input").focus(function() { input....
[04:44:03] <gnarf> cache selections!
[04:44:57] <Brklyn> hi guys.... one real quick question....
[04:50:36] <mazzachre> Anyone in here using jquerymobile? The jquerymobile channel is quite dead, and I have a few problem
[04:50:54] <Anticom2> why can't i access my json-object returned from an ajax request using response.tplName and repsonse.tplTitle http://pastebin.com/p0bQ9JvP ??
[04:52:28] <sethetter> Does anyone know of a text expander type alternative I can use with vim?
[04:52:33] <Anticom2> oh, forgott dataType >.<

[05:03:57] <noob480> ablomen did u have a look
[05:03:58] <noob480> http://pastie.org/2242409
[05:04:01] <gnarf> pr0ton: their google group for maps api / dev thing?
[05:04:12] <ablomen> noob480, yes i had in ##javascript too ;)
[05:04:21] <noob480> ohh u rd same guy
[05:04:23] <noob480> lol
[05:04:29] <pr0ton> ablomen, ok
[05:04:31] <gnarf> i haven't
[05:04:34] <gnarf> and I wont
[05:04:34] <ablomen> you still have not said what your actual problem is
[05:04:42] <pr0ton> so basically in google maps, i've render a path, using the directions API
[05:04:47] <pr0ton> now how do i 'unrender' it
[05:04:50] <pr0ton> basically get it off the map
[05:05:03] <pr0ton> gnarf, searching on google paralelly
[05:05:12] <noob480> line 28-35 is where i have defined
[05:05:14] <noob480> for tree
[05:05:15] <gnarf> pr0ton: you should ASK on SO too ;)
[05:05:22] <gnarf> pr0ton: if you ever find the answer, you can post it
[05:05:26] <noob480> function for tree
[05:05:33] <gnarf> pr0ton: then the next guy with that problem will find your question
[05:05:33] <noob480> 27
[05:05:34] <gnarf> and +1 it
[05:05:40] <pr0ton> gnarf, true true
[05:05:59] <gnarf> pr0ton: plus, i think SO's audience is a bit wider
[05:06:04] <gnarf> than #jquery or even ##javascript
[05:06:07] <noob480> and its not working
[05:06:17] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[05:06:18] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[05:06:24] <pr0ton> gnarf, true again
[05:06:30] <noob480> i dont get a tree
[05:06:38] <jquery> noob give me souce
[05:06:38] <noob480> it just dispalys the file name
[05:06:55] <noob480> http://pastie.org/2242409
[05:06:58] <jquery> ok
[05:07:06] <guy> gnarf: got a minute? I've rewritten the code. http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html can you see the http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/public/js/jquery.tab-flow.1.0.js if I didn't make any other stupid mistakes?
[05:07:41] <guy> and, there is this one strange behaviour I've noticed: when I start to drag an element, jQuery adds overflow: hidden on the elements (not sure why.)
[05:08:47] <sethetter> what kinds of projects did you guys work on when you were just starting out? I'm still quite a beginner and can't think of things to build really. I spend too much time reading code and not enough writing it.
[05:08:57] <gnarf> guy: about 100 style based issues there
[05:09:00] <gnarf> but i mean
[05:09:09] <is_null> hi all, i don't understand why, considering such html: <div id="x"><a id="y">foo</a></div>, and such js: $('#x').click(function() { $(this).find('a').click(); }); causes an endless loop
[05:09:10] <gnarf> i only got so much advice per day
[05:09:11] <gnarf> :)
[05:09:25] <gnarf> is that code really double spaced?
[05:09:34] <gnarf> or are u using a windows editor thats saving \r\n's? :)
[05:09:44] <guy> I am editing stuff on OSX.
[05:09:58] <guy> not sure what you mean by double spaced, though
[05:10:08] <jquery> i dont know what about souce error
[05:10:26] <gnarf> like the whole "fn" block on $.hp is "double spaced"
[05:10:36] <gnarf> every line has an empty line betweenit
[05:10:48] <guy> uh.. let me see
[05:10:50] <gnarf> there is no reason to quote most of those object literal keys
[05:10:55] <jquery> gnarf is greate
[05:10:59] <gnarf> ?js {'center': true }
[05:11:00] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: invalid label
[05:11:11] <gnarf> ?js ({ 'center': true }
[05:11:12] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical
[05:11:12] <gnarf> ?js ({ 'center': true })
[05:11:13] <bot-t> gnarf: {"center": true}
[05:11:18] <gnarf> ?js ({ center: true })
[05:11:19] <bot-t> gnarf: {"center": true}
[05:11:20] <guy> gnarf: yeah, I do know that. I don't know why i started, it just makes more sense to me to either quote them all or none.
[05:11:28] <gnarf> a few you need
[05:11:31] <gnarf> like "class"
[05:11:33] <gnarf> but thats about it
[05:11:36] <jquery> .css('center','true')
[05:11:36] <gnarf> :)
[05:12:01] <noob480> jquery did u have a lok ?
[05:12:15] <guy> gnarf: and yeah, I see what you mean by "double spaced" funny, I didn't noticed that the whole code looks like this
[05:13:12] <gnarf> guy: other than that , there seems to be a bunch of wierd stuff going on in there, you might want to bring a lot of the "base functions" outside of your doc ready...
[05:13:28] <gnarf> its just generally ahrd to read that code
[05:13:53] <guy> gnarf: I am mostly interested in anything that'd optimize the perfomance/animation of the script.
[05:14:15] <gnarf> i can't even tell what your performance / animation slow spots would be
[05:14:19] <jquery> me too
[05:14:21] <gnarf> beause i can't follow the code
[05:17:43] <pr0ton> gnarf, ablomen i found it
[05:17:55] <pr0ton> from the source code out here
[05:17:55] <pr0ton> http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-samples-v3/source/browse/trunk/drivingdirections/directions-optimized.html?r=80
[05:17:56] <gnarf> guy: you might want to spend some time looking around inside of the jQuery code
[05:18:12] <guy> gnarf: for?
[05:18:14] <gnarf> guy: and perhaps looking at the style guides
[05:18:19] <guy> I see.
[05:18:24] <gnarf> guy: inspiration of better organizational methods
[05:18:30] <Kichael> I'm using .ajaxForm, how can I have two ajaxForm calls for the same form? One ends up overiding the other, but I want the submit to happen to two different urls
[05:18:50] <pr0ton> Kichael, specify in more detail.
[05:18:50] <Kichael> with seperate callback functions
[05:18:52] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[05:19:00] <seutje> motherfucker, this designer used a different line-height for each character in all titles, depending on which character it is >_<
[05:19:03] <pr0ton> gnarf, thanks! i needed that too
[05:19:07] <seutje> ups, wrong chan
[05:19:13] <kojiro> seutje: haha anyway
[05:19:20] <pr0ton> seutje, lol
[05:19:31] <pr0ton> who has a handle motherfucker!? :D
[05:20:17] <kojiro> pr0ton: dads.
[05:20:19] <BlaDe^> Hi guys - is there a known issue with $('option:selected') not working in ie7/8 ? .length is always 0
[05:20:26] <sadmicrowave> pr0ton, thats obtuse
[05:20:28] <gnarf> BlaDe^: see ?p
[05:20:29] <bot-t> BlaDe^, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:20:29] <Kichael> I have one form, once the user clicks submit, there needs to be two ajax requests, I've tried to simply create two .ajaxForm which target the same id of the form
[05:20:35] <BlaDe^> gnarf why? I asked a simple question
[05:20:39] <Kichael> one ends up overwriting the other
[05:20:41] <BlaDe^> is there a known issue..
[05:20:45] <Kichael> instead of both being fired
[05:21:06] <gnarf> BlaDe^: I'm unaware of one, but if there is one I'd like to see a fiddle of it so i can help you find the workaround / file the bug
[05:21:17] <BlaDe^> ok no problem i'll get right on it
[05:21:20] <sadmicrowave> Kichael, turn async: false in the ajax options
[05:21:31] <pr0ton> BlaDe^, you're using some ajaxForm plugin?
[05:21:42] <pr0ton> sorry***
[05:21:46] <Kichael> yes I am
[05:21:49] <pr0ton> Kichael, i meant that for you... ajaxForm is a plugin
[05:22:09] <gnarf> Kichael: .ajaxSubmit()
[05:22:11] <pr0ton> Kichael, i'm not sure about that plugin
[05:22:18] <pr0ton> why not use your own .ajax requests instead?
[05:22:26] <sadmicrowave> the problem is that since the 'a' in ajax stands for asynchronous they are being fired at the same time
[05:22:28] <pr0ton> i think you want two ajax requests, but the plugin supports only 1 ?
[05:22:47] <pr0ton> sadmicrowave, no i think the issue is that, he's wants two requests, but his plugin overwrites them
[05:23:10] <pr0ton> Kichael, did i get you correctly?
[05:23:23] <gnarf> Kichael:  $("form").bind("submit", function(e) { var frm = $(this); frm.ajaxSubmit( options1 ); frm.ajaxSubmit( options2 ); e.preventDefault(); });
[05:24:03] <guy> is doing something like this resource-expensive?
[05:24:03] <guy> $.hp.li_elements.not(':hidden');
[05:24:07] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: wrong
[05:24:10] <gnarf> ?async
[05:24:11] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[05:24:11] <guy> I did console.time() and I get 1ms
[05:24:19] <guy> which seems not a lot
[05:24:34] <Kichael> thanks gnarf, I figured it had to do with using ajaxSubmit instead of ajaxForm in the plugin, :)
[05:24:54] <s3d_matt> Hi All. I have a jquery powered drop down, and inside the drop down im using Mosaci - a jquery roll over thing.
[05:24:56] <gnarf> Kichael: i'd really investigate that design pattern tho
[05:25:06] <gnarf> double requests should be avoided when possible
[05:25:09] <s3d_matt> the events  are not triggering, how do i rebind them (im guessing that is the issue)
[05:25:22] <BlaDe^> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/HesCX/1/
[05:25:30] <BlaDe^> the problem, upon closer inspection may be the invalid html
[05:25:42] <Kichael> so you're saying I should conscolidate the outputs into one json returned
[05:25:43] <BlaDe^> but it's generated from a jquery plugin
[05:25:56] <BlaDe^> It works in every browser, including IE9, just not IE7/8
[05:25:57] <Kichael> so it's only one request hmmm
[05:26:35] <gnarf> <option>s can only exist inside <select>s i think
[05:27:00] <gnarf> BlaDe^: and WTF document.write
[05:27:13] <s3d_matt> any ideas, hints or pointers?
[05:27:17] <BlaDe^> console.log bugs for some people, and alert() is annoying
[05:27:26] <gnarf> yeah
[05:27:30] <gnarf> but the console.log gives me "2"
[05:27:37] <BlaDe^> in what browser
[05:27:39] <gnarf> document.write() empties the document if its already cosed you know
[05:27:51] <sacre2> any advanced js users?  i've hit some undef behavior with no explanation
[05:28:06] <gnarf> BlaDe^: im pretty sure its the fact that your <option> isn't inside a <select>
[05:28:15] <BlaDe^> i think you may be right.. odd that only ie7/8 care though
[05:28:16] <BlaDe^> hold on
[05:29:59] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HesCX/2/
[05:30:04] <gnarf> that reports "1" for me
[05:30:06] <gnarf> in ie8
[05:30:13] <gnarf> and yer right, 0 in ie8 on yer old one
[05:31:12] <gnarf> and thats not really that strange
[05:31:16] <gnarf> IE has a lot of wierness
[05:31:17] <gnarf> :)
[05:31:28] <hariom> I have dialog box that has two text input fields. When I enter some value in those field and click on submit event, I am able to get the values using $("input#field1").val(). But If I close this dialog and reopen and then enter any input and click on submit, I don't get any value?
[05:31:47] <gnarf> BlaDe^: what plugin is this that generates that html?
[05:31:52] <gnarf> so i can go make fun of it
[05:32:10] <hariom> Should I destroy the dialog box before reopening?
[05:32:39] <hariom> Why I don't get text value from the text field on the dialog fox if I close and open it again.
[05:33:32] <Anticom2> when using jq ui .tabs() with an external resource, are my includes gone then?
[05:33:44] <Anticom2> like <script src="jquery"/> etc
[05:34:06] <gnarf> Anticom2: are you specifying an id on the remote page?
[05:34:34] <Anticom2> gnarf what id? what i got is: <li><a href="tplZuordnen.php">Templates zuordnen</a></li>
[05:35:06] <gnarf> Anticom2: injecting <script> tags w/ jQuery can prove awkward
[05:35:22] <Anticom2> grml
[05:35:42] <gnarf> not to say it isn't possible
[05:35:54] <gnarf> but i really don't have time to dig into the .tabs() specifics right now
[05:36:01] <gnarf> but some info so you can
[05:36:04] <Anticom2> so simply including them in the remote file again would be most simple solution gnarf ?
[05:36:05] <sadmicrowave> hariom, are you using dialog UI?
[05:36:16] <hariom> sadmicrowave: yes
[05:36:23] <gnarf> Anticom2: no, like you mean the scripts on the main page?
[05:36:32] <Anticom2> yep
[05:36:35] <gnarf> the main page scripts should still be there
[05:36:37] <gnarf> of course
[05:36:42] <sadmicrowave> hariom, usually there is no need to destroy it on close
[05:36:49] <sadmicrowave> hariom, just close it
[05:36:52] <Anticom2> becaues my .live('click'...) method doesn't work in the loaded tab
[05:36:57] <gnarf> you cant get rid of a script once its in the ddom - it already run
[05:37:10] <gnarf> look at $(document).data('events')
[05:37:15] <gnarf> in the console
[05:37:19] <Anticom2> kay
[05:37:22] <gnarf> see if that event is still bound
[05:37:26] <hariom> sadmicrowave: This is the actual issue: I have dialog box that has two text input fields. When I enter some value in those field and click on submit event, I am able to get the values using $("input#field1").val(). But If I close this dialog and reopen and then enter any input and click on submit, I don't get any value. Why is so?
[05:37:36] <gnarf> if it is, you're probably not matching the selector
[05:37:57] <gnarf> or - something else is stopping the event propagation
[05:38:13] <gnarf> either way - i wont be around to help you with your next part of this issue
[05:38:23] <gnarf> bout to leave for breakfast than work
[05:38:30] <sadmicrowave> hariom, does 'submit' handle the dialog('close') also?
[05:38:39] <hariom> sadmicrowave: I am able to get the entered text values if I don't close and reopen the dialog box. If I close and reopen the dialog, whatever value I enter in it, I don't get.
[05:38:45] <hariom> sadmicrowave: yes
[05:38:58] <gnarf> hariom: you are probably creating a second dialog
[05:39:01] <gnarf> which creates a second input
[05:39:09] <gnarf> instead of reusing your first dialog
[05:39:11] <sadmicrowave> hariom, can you post your 'submit' code
[05:39:21] <gnarf> HTML ID's are unique
[05:39:21] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, you're probably right
[05:39:24] <hariom> sure.
[05:39:32] <gnarf> so if you have two of the same one
[05:39:35] <gnarf> you get the first one
[05:39:52] <sadmicrowave> very true
[05:40:13] <seutje> I have a bookmarklet to check for duplicate IDs, what does that tell you?
[05:40:19] <gnarf> have you thought about $("input[name=field1]")
[05:40:43] <gnarf> have you thought about dialog.find("input[name=field1]")
[05:40:47] <Anticom2> gnarf got it, plugin i used had a "bad" quality
[05:40:56] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[05:40:57] <blackspotwiggins> "bad"
[05:41:01] <Anticom2> =D
[05:41:18] <Anticom2> used .click() instead of .live('click')
[05:41:21] <Anticom2> (=
[05:45:23] <hariom> gnarf, sadmicrowave: http://jsfiddle.net/VeK5g/
[05:49:43] <hariom> gnarf, sadmicrowave: anything you found that is creating issue?
[05:49:53] <hariom> http://jsfiddle.net/VeK5g/
[05:52:46] <sadmicrowave> hariom, can you put an alert in onLoginFormSubmit and see if it is even getting to that function the second time?
[05:53:28] <hariom> sadmicrowave: Yea, it is geetting to the function. I can see the log message but it gives empty username and password even there are text in field1 an field2
[05:54:01] <sadmicrowave> hariom, so console.log shows empty for the 2 variables?
[05:54:11] <hariom> yea
[05:54:16] <hariom> username: password:
[05:54:20] <hariom> no text
[05:55:05] <asymetrixs> i'm looking for a good ajax Queue plugin, can somone recommend one? google did not send me any plugins which are rated as "good"
[05:56:59] <sadmicrowave> hariom, I don't see anything obviously wrong
[05:57:20] <ax99> hariom what browser are you using? it is showing me the values
[05:57:32] <hariom> ax99: FF5
[05:58:04] <hariom> ax99: close the dialog and reopen and then enter the text and see if you can get the text what you entered.
[05:58:13] <mazzachre> When I have a json object describing an array (from server [{...},{...},{...}] Can I get the length of that somehow?
[05:58:38] <hariom> ax99: don't refresh but just close and reopen and try getting the text back
[05:58:50] <mazzachre> does it adhere to Array.length ?
[05:59:23] <tbranyen> ?json object
[05:59:30] <tbranyen> fu bot-t
[06:03:34] <hariom> ax99: do you still see the values?
[06:04:05] <ax99> hariom: well, I added a button, closed and reopened and still showing me the values.. I dont know if I'm getting your point
[06:05:27] <ax99> hariom: take a look http://jsfiddle.net/VeK5g/3/
[06:07:57] <ax99> privmsg ax99 hola
[06:12:36] <plombardi> Does anyone know how I could use the .remove() function on all children of a definition list?
[06:15:21] <Brklyn> hey guys, I'm currently stuck with a little ajax trouble.... I have a page which loads via ajax a form inside a div. Now when that form is submitted, in the event of success, the div holding the form should be reloaded. For some reason the $.post() is reloading the parent page, and changing the url.... any hints why?
[06:15:28] <plombardi> Nevermind found my answer... apparently I wanted the empty() function
[06:17:51] <Brklyn> BTW the $.post() sometimes posts, sometimes doesn't feel....
[06:18:38] <Brklyn> *feel = send, don't know what I was thinking
[06:19:45] <sadmicrowave> Brklyn, try using $.ajax() instead
[06:20:00] <Brklyn> let me try that
[06:20:41] <BlaDe^> how can I change an <input> to a <select> ?
[06:20:50] <BlaDe^> weird question Iknow, but is it possible?
[06:21:04] <sadmicrowave> BlaDe^, yes, .replaceWith()
[06:21:48] <BlaDe^> sadmicrowave: $('#recpemail').replaceWith($('<select></select>')); ?
[06:22:07] <sadmicrowave> yep
[06:22:39] <sadmicrowave> BlaDe^, short hand of that could be $('#recpemail').replaceWith($('<select/>'));
[06:23:16] <BlaDe^> sadmicrowave my problem is a jquery plugin si creating invalid markup which wont work on IE 7 or IE 8
[06:23:26] <BlaDe^> i've been looking at rewriting it but it's just way too much code. My test case is here: http://jsfiddle.net/HesCX/4/
[06:23:51] <BlaDe^> option:selected is not returning any results on ie7/8 because it's wrapped in an input
[06:25:01] <sadmicrowave> BlaDe^, so you want to append the content of the input's to the select's also?
[06:25:16] <BlaDe^> yes
[06:28:26] <BlaDe^> sadmicrowave should I do .children().clone() before I do the replace with then append that?
[06:28:29] <BlaDe^> or is there a better way ?
[06:29:51] <sadmicrowave> can you not just make it a select box in all browsers? eliminating the need for the input field entirely
[06:31:38] <hariom> ax99: yea, I see it works on the link you sent but not working for me :(
[06:31:48] <codecab> hi there, what is the fastest way to select first TD from all TR in a particular table?
[06:32:23] <sadmicrowave> BlaDe^, one of the problems is that input's can't contain DOM hierarchy like that, you need div's for something like that....so can we use <div name='recpemail'...> </div> instead of <input>?
[06:32:24] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, $("table td:first-child")
[06:32:50] <BlaDe^> sadmicrowave nope.. I wish I could make it a select but the plugin needs an input
[06:33:00] <sadmicrowave> which plugin?
[06:33:01] <BlaDe^> i'm trying to find a way to make it append the options to somethign else but there seems to be a lot of rewriting
[06:33:06] <BlaDe^> fcbk - it's quite highly modified though
[06:33:06] <codecab> blackspotwiggins: this is the fastest possible selector?
[06:33:07] <blackspotwiggins> BlaDe^, what kind of retarded plugin are you using
[06:33:16] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, probably no
[06:33:48] <codecab> but i asked for the fastest way :)
[06:34:04] <codecab> i could iterate over tr using dom core methods
[06:34:12] <blackspotwiggins> that's hardly faster
[06:34:24] <blackspotwiggins> stop worrying about the speed of your selectors
[06:34:25] <sadmicrowave> codecab, an alternative would be $("table tr").first().find('td')
[06:34:31] <codecab> but this way i would have to wrap the TDs with $() again to jquerify it
[06:34:31] <blackspotwiggins> sadmicrowave, no
[06:34:34] <blackspotwiggins> thats wrong
[06:34:45] <sadmicrowave> how so?
[06:34:58] <codecab> selects all td of first tr
[06:35:10] <sadmicrowave> oops
[06:35:19] <blackspotwiggins> sadmicrowave, contemplate on the difference of tds from the first row and the first tds of all the rows
[06:35:42] <sadmicrowave> sorry I didn't read his question well enough I guess
[06:37:40] <codecab> would it be faster to iterate over table[0].tBodies[0].rows[i].childNodes[0] and wrap each returned node with $(node) to make it useable for jquery?
[06:38:05] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, do you really care for 2ms difference?
[06:38:07] <codecab> or is the $(node) selection not that fast
[06:38:12] <codecab> yes
[06:38:21] <blackspotwiggins> try it on jsperf.com if it really gives you a boner
[06:38:23] <codecab> on a 1000 row x 20 column table
[06:39:40] <codecab> i know jquery is not suitable for high performance js, but its so convenient..
[06:39:49] <blackspotwiggins> really
[06:39:55] <blackspotwiggins> how do you know that
[06:43:04] <ax99> haha I agree with that too
[06:43:10] <JustWP> how to "grey out" a section of html so its not clickable on a form?
[06:43:43] <ax99> put a div over it
[06:43:48] <JustWP> so if you click on a radio button that part of form becomes clickable
[06:43:56] <JustWP> so you can enter data
[06:44:09] <JustWP> div? and then what?
[06:44:10] <Me-Selfe> JustWP: .disable()
[06:44:24] <JustWP> Me-Selfe: nice. i'll try that
[06:45:03] <codecab> JustWP: just a webprogrammer mh?
[06:45:18] <JustWP> whats mh?
[06:45:28] <codecab> ever tried html? is fokkin awesome
[06:45:43] <codecab> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.12.1
[06:46:01] <seutje> ?os
[06:46:02] <bot-t> oh snaoâ„¢
[06:46:07] <Me-Selfe> JustWP: seem i making up methods.. try .removeAttr('disabled') instead
[06:46:10] <codecab> "there must be a jquery plugin to do this"
[06:46:39] <seutje> you should add a focus handler that just throws focus somewhere else, just for lulz
[06:47:06] <JustWP> Me-Selfe: thanks and to reenable?
[06:47:32] <codecab> JustWP: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.12.1 + brain and youre done.
[06:47:46] <seutje> .attr('disabled', true)
[06:48:01] <Me-Selfe> codecab: whats brain?
[06:48:03] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, nice but it'd be better to refer to html5 spec now
[06:48:03] <Me-Selfe> :p
[06:48:33] <blackspotwiggins> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/attributes-common-to-form-controls.html#enabling-and-disabling-form-controls
[06:48:42] <codecab> thanks
[06:49:54] <JustWP> codecab: thanks but you still need jquery to remove the html disabled attr.
[06:50:30] <codecab> not necessarily but for convenience, yes
[06:50:40] <codecab> but theres also http://api.jquery.com
[06:52:40] <JustWP> problem now is if useragent has no js then it says disabled :S
[06:52:48] <JustWP> *stays
[06:53:06] <incorrect> i am trying to figure out why something works in ff and not in ie, what is the IE eqiv to firebug?
[06:53:13] <blackspotwiggins> is there a realistic use case where ua doesnt have js?
[06:53:35] <blackspotwiggins> incorrect, there are dev tools in ie8+
[06:53:54] <Anticom> i don't get my ui autocomplete running: http://pastebin.com/TUvz7bUu
[06:53:58] <incorrect> oh thanks
[06:54:08] <Anticom> think there muts be some issue with mapping the results
[06:54:30] <is_null> hi all, why would el.next().next().attr('class') return 'option', wheras el.next('.option').attr('class') returns undefined ?
[06:54:45] <bjhaid1> hi, please can anyone help me have a look @ my code at: https://gist.github.com/1093055 I dont know why its not working
[06:55:08] <blackspotwiggins> is_null, maybe the next node does not have the class option
[06:55:10] <rudi_> hi all
[06:55:23] <is_null> blackspotwiggins: so ? should that stop next() ?!
[06:55:36] <blackspotwiggins> next() is for the next node only
[06:55:56] <blackspotwiggins> so .next("something") when it doesnt match gives emtpy set
[06:55:58] <bjhaid1> I expect a modal to pop-up once polling is completed but it doesnt
[06:56:04] <is_null> blackspotwiggins: ahhh, right ... thanks
[06:56:15] <Dr4g> Good morning :)
[06:56:17] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you want .nextAll(".option:first")
[06:56:25] <is_null> yes!!! thanks blackspotwiggins
[06:56:34] <rudi_> I have dynamic .get function(var) getting string i want to use inside the function ... zodiac.var.text ... where var is "aries" for example
[06:57:08] <rudi_> console.log(zodiac.var.text) outputs nothing :/
[06:57:34] <Me-Selfe> rudi_: whats the exact code?
[06:57:36] <kborchers> ?demo @ rudi
[06:57:37] <bot-t> rudi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:01:05] <SoulRaven> hi
[07:01:11] <rudi_> sorry ... i cant reproduce this ... thanks anyway :)
[07:01:30] <SoulRaven> anyone use Tabletools?
[07:01:36] <SoulRaven> and datatools
[07:01:37] <SoulRaven> ?
[07:01:51] <SoulRaven> Datatable
[07:01:57] <SoulRaven> http://datatables.net/
[07:04:06] <JustWP> can you have one label for two controls? e.g. expiry date on card for month and year inputs?
[07:04:10] <gnarf> seems blackspotwiggins is here to give advice, I'm gonna go back to lurking ;)
[07:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[07:04:28] <blackspotwiggins> im leaving soon tho
[07:10:22] <codecab> SoulRaven: do you have a specific question or are is this something like a statistical survey? :>
[07:10:30] <codecab> -are Oo
[07:13:50] <sacre2> ok i have some jquery that I need to execute after insertRow(), so I load it into a string and then execute setTimeout.. it doesn't seem to run
[07:14:20] <kborchers> ?p @ sacre2
[07:14:21] <bot-t> sacre2, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:15:11] <blackspotwiggins> sacho, the easiest would be blabla.insertRow(); othershit();
[07:15:17] <blackspotwiggins> meh sacre2 i meant
[07:15:29] <sacre2> hey it worked nvm
[07:22:33] <emilkarl> Is it possible to trigger a click on a link that's in an iframe from the parent?
[07:22:35] <codecab> blackspotwiggins: http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-child
[07:23:01] <emilkarl> ex $('iframe a.foo').trigger('click');
[07:25:15] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, ?
[07:25:39] <codecab> <blackspotwiggins> codecab, do you really care for 2ms difference?
[07:25:50] <blackspotwiggins> the question is still valid
[07:26:12] <blackspotwiggins> 25000 / sec vs 38000 / sec
[07:28:40] <codecab> nevermind, thought you might be interested
[07:28:50] <blackspotwiggins> if you are rendering 20column 1000row tble, it will be much slower anyway
[07:29:50] <blackspotwiggins> but yeah, naturally plain dom is much much faster
[07:30:09] <den_> Could someone look at my syntax for this. http://pastebin.com/auCG08KJ
[07:30:12] <codecab> ye its kinda slow, but i dont want to slow it down further
[07:30:39] <den_> The first log returns the object I want but when I run .find() it doesn't return anything
[07:30:40] <blackspotwiggins> if it becomes slower in real life due to selector, things must be quite bad already
[07:31:14] <codecab> and i had some trouble with inefficient jquery selectors in the past, so i wanted to make sure i dont run into the same problem
[07:31:22] <blackspotwiggins> the thing is
[07:31:25] <blackspotwiggins> with qsa
[07:31:34] <blackspotwiggins> the selector performance will change with every browser version
[07:31:55] <codecab> to the better?
[07:32:06] <blackspotwiggins> hopefully ,yes
[07:32:14] <blackspotwiggins> but they can change around both ways
[07:32:57] <codecab> but we cant force our clients to upgrade their browser version, all we can do is recommend something...
[07:33:06] <blackspotwiggins> that's true as well
[07:33:21] <DarsVaeda> hi, I load a html page that has a form which sends to the same html page into a dialog, when the form is send the page is loaded as the whole page, can I load it inside the dialog again somehow?
[07:33:22] <blackspotwiggins> but selector performance is not as static as it seems
[07:33:49] <codecab> so theres some light at the end of the tunnel
[07:35:10] <zerium1> how do you translate an id like foo[8889999] into a javascript object using jq?
[07:35:43] <zerium1> or just an array like foo[0] = 8889999
[07:35:52] <taar779> Is there anyway to find the class instance of a class without having to use the .each() and grab the index?
[07:36:50] <emilkarl> Is it possible to have a Tweet button with the count and then trigger the popup from jQuery? The a is in a iframe which I'm not allowed to trigger click on?
[07:36:56] <taar779> *last -.-
[07:37:12] <codecab> taar779: index of what? which kind of class?
[07:38:55] <dr34mc0d3r> can someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/SKFGC/7/  and help me figure out y the slider locks up after setting an end date.
[07:39:56] <taar779> codecab, lets say I have a bunch of input elements with the class of category. All I want to do is to somehow find the last one, the last instance of that class (category). So for example, there are 4 on the page currently, so the last one would be category[3] in the DOM tree.
[07:41:04] <taar779> codecab, Jquery will be adding more and more so I have to somehow be able to find which one is the last in the DOM tree so I can append another element of that class
[07:41:21] <phlp> $('.category').last()
[07:41:56] <codecab> there u go
[07:42:45] <Kingsy> if I have this on my site..  <p id="seo-more">   with this js --> console.log(jQuery('#seo-more'));  why does it return [ ]
[07:43:50] <phlp> Kingsy: is it in $(document).ready ?
[07:43:51] <taar779> phlp, thank you! I must have been searching for the wrong thing on google since I didn't come across that function >< codecab, thanks for your help as well :P
[07:44:04] <Kingsy> phlp: GOOD THINKING.. no
[07:44:05] <Kingsy> :P
[07:50:44] <lacrymology> hello, I keep seeing $(function(){code}).. what does that do?
[07:51:02] <lacrymology> is it equivalent to $(document).ready() or something?
[07:51:02] <phlp> lacrymology: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/#chapter-3
[07:51:29] <lacrymology> phlp: lol. Thanks
[07:51:41] <phlp> ;)

[07:58:14] <JustWP> hi, how to add an attribute? jquery API not seen there
[07:58:41] <JustWP> http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/ <-- not in here
[07:59:25] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[08:00:21] <Anticom> =(
[08:05:35] <zerium1> how do i get an element when it's id is: value_selected_books[9780073376592]
[08:05:58] <taar779> This works fine on jsfiddle but when I put it on my site, it doesn't work at all ... http://jsfiddle.net/XN4c4/1/ any ideas? I checked to make sure I have all the correct files being referenced too in the header ...
[08:06:04] <yan_nick> hey guys, i've html in an attribute. how can i get only the text of the attribute?
[08:06:13] <zerium1> .text()
[08:06:40] <phlp> zerium1: $('#value_selected_books\\[9780073376592\\]')
[08:06:46] <yan_nick> $(".foo").attr("data-html").text(); doesn't work
[08:06:51] <yan_nick> zerium1: ^^
[08:07:05] <zerium1> yan_nick $foo.text()
[08:07:21] <zerium1> phlp: thx
[08:07:31] <yan_nick> zerium1: $foo = $(this).attr("data-html"); ?
[08:07:42] <phlp> yan_nick: $('.foo').data('html') will get the data-html attribute
[08:08:15] <yan_nick> phlp: this isn't the question, i only want to get the text of html text
[08:08:32] <doki_pen> is there a way to open a link in a background tab/window?
[08:08:33] <zerium1> yan_nick: like strip out the html?
[08:08:33] <JustWP> hi, is it slower to use jquery to do some css?
[08:08:45] <doki_pen> I don't want the new tab/window to steal focus
[08:08:49] <yan_nick> zerium1: how can i do thst?
[08:10:10] <zerium1> $('#foo').text();
[08:10:14] <guy> I need some reviews. what do you think guys about the animation? http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html
[08:10:32] <phlp> yan_nick: $($('.foo').data('html')).text()
[08:16:23] <zerium1> guy: that finger replacing the mouse is annoying
[08:17:02] <guy> I know. Though client insists.
[08:17:11] <bjhaid1> please is this code right?   1 if  (<%=Switchvox.last.exten_number%> == 4101) {
[08:17:12] <bjhaid1>   2 $('#call').dialog('open');
[08:17:12] <bjhaid1>   3 }
[08:17:26] <gnarf> it is so wrong
[08:17:42] <gnarf> ?js if  (<%=Switchvox.last.exten_number%> == 4101)  {}
[08:17:43] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: illegal XML character
[08:18:15] <bjhaid1>  if  ('Switchvox.last.exten_number' == 4101) {
[08:18:15] <bjhaid1> $('#call').dialog('open');
[08:18:15] <bjhaid1>  }
[08:18:23] <gnarf> that will never be true
[08:18:45] <gnarf> your asp echo was probably closer
[08:18:51] <bjhaid1> gnarf: <%=Switchvox.last.exten_number%> is a variable in ruby
[08:18:51] <gnarf> but that is such bad practice
[08:18:57] <gnarf> okay ruby
[08:18:59] <here4thegear> I'm using datatables and within it... "fnServerData": function (sSource, aoData, fnCallback){ajaxy stuffs} How do I find out more info about the three args here... I'm getting null on the aoData
[08:19:01] <gnarf> yer not as bad as i thought
[08:19:03] <gnarf> but
[08:19:08] <gnarf> ruby asp or php
[08:19:09] <gnarf> all the same
[08:19:11] <gnarf> JS is JS
[08:19:15] <gnarf> don't embed ruby in it
[08:19:41] <bjhaid1> gnarf: that's not where I have a problem, it runs, when line 2 is alert
[08:19:52] <bjhaid1> but with the dialog, it doesnt
[08:20:03] <gnarf> is there an error?
[08:20:11] <solidus-river> hey all, on my ajax call when i get a 409 response it sends me back the data i sent not the data recieved from the server, why?
[08:20:15] <gnarf> what is $("#call").length
[08:20:15] <bjhaid1> gnarf: I dont know how to debug
[08:20:18] <solidus-river> and how do i get the data from the server on a 409
[08:20:21] <gnarf> ?ftj @bjhaid1
[08:20:22] <bot-t> bjhaid1, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:20:44] <gnarf> solidus-river: 409 is an error code
[08:20:47] <gnarf> thats all server side
[08:20:50] <solidus-river> gnarf: i know
[08:21:08] <bjhaid1> gnarf: let me check
[08:21:11] <solidus-river> gnarf: but according to my browser agent i get a 409 and a response of { 'id' : '19', 'name' : 'test' }
[08:21:13] <gnarf> it will probably be handled in the .fail() branch of the dfd
[08:21:30] <gnarf> solidus-river: then that means thats what your server is responding with apparently
[08:21:32] <solidus-river> but according to jQuery i get a response (in the .fail branch) of the data i sent
[08:21:45] <gnarf> how are you getting that data?
[08:21:52] <solidus-river> well thats dumb because a 409 doesnt meant the data the server sends back is not interesting to the client
[08:22:03] <here4thegear> usuing AJAX and getting a 409 error? :-) your app wants cleaner code (sorry, just found it funny)
[08:22:30] <gnarf> solidus-river: the fail branch takes diff args than the success branch
[08:23:04] <solidus-river> gnarf: whoops :X i was trying to do it via .error() data, but data isn't valid in error, my fault
[08:23:11] <solidus-river> gnarf: going to get at it through the jqXHR
[08:23:15] <mikeischris> Hey gang, If a secondary menu is present, I want to have the primary menu dimmed. But make in fully visible on hover - I'm thinking jquery will be a good way to do this. Can anyone give me some direction as to how to achieve this
[08:23:20] <gnarf> solidus-river: responseText ;)
[08:24:50] <gnarf> solidus-river: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check out "statusCode"
[08:24:53] <gnarf> it might be useful to you
[08:25:05] <gnarf> nvm
[08:25:08] <gnarf> i didnt finish reading that opt
[08:25:54] <here4thegear> mikeischris: just add a .live("click", function(e){})... and within the function switch the class of the two elements.
[08:26:23] <here4thegear> $(this).addClass("selected");
[08:26:29] <taar779> I'm trying to help out a classmate with his project and for some odd reason  .val() is not grabbing the changed text inside of the <textarea> tag. Any ideas?
[08:27:04] <mikeischris> here4thegear: Thanks for your response. Unfortunately my javascript is very weak.
[08:27:35] <solidus-river> hmm.. i'm having trouble turning the responseText into a JSON object or array, but it is a valid json object. eval( jqXHR.responseText ); doesnt seem to be doing the trick
[08:29:32] <solidus-river> the jqXHR.responseText is {"id":"12","name":"test","persona_id":"63"}
[08:29:35] <mikeischris> here4thegear: can you provide some more specific direction
[08:29:46] <solidus-river> eval(jqXHR.responseText) however errors out
[08:30:00] <phlp> ? $.parseJSON @ solidus-river
[08:30:01] <bot-t> solidus-river, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[08:30:11] <bjhaid1> gnarf: the error is attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope
[08:31:11] <solidus-river> phlp: cool! but how come eval doesn't work, isn't eval supposed to do the same thing?
[08:31:44] <here4thegear> mikeischris: http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[08:33:01] <here4thegear> mikeischris: you'll need to understand event binding and handlers .live() will help you http://api.jquery.com/live
[08:36:40] <oDesk> hello all
[08:37:03] <oDesk> would ajaxstar() work out of iframe ?
[08:38:05] <gnarf> solidus-river: you might need () around the json to eval it
[08:38:28] <gnarf> solidus-river: also, its a gaping security hole
[08:38:34] <gnarf> (eval)
[08:38:39] <gnarf> :)
[08:39:29] <solidus-river> gnarf: good catch, didn't thinkg about the security problems with it
[08:40:03] <solidus-river> but then if eval is a security hole, wouldn't inline functions be as well?
[08:42:34] <gnarf> "inline function"?
[08:45:08] <zoned> is there any way i can take a string variable and evaluate it to use it as the operator in a boolean statement? i'm not sure how to explain this... is there anyway i can achieve something similar to this? http://pastebin.com/iLXiARp6
[08:45:39] <Ariel_Calzada> how to split a html document of one column, into two column html document???
[08:45:43] <Ariel_Calzada> any idea?
[08:46:27] <zoned> Ariel_Calzada: column1 style=float:left width:50%, column2 style=float:right width:50%
[08:46:27] <zoned> lol
[08:46:47] <Ariel_Calzada> zoned: :) i mean how to split the text
[08:47:05] <zoned> i don't understand the question
[08:47:15] <solidus-river> gnarf: functions declaired by function(){};
[08:47:39] <solidus-river> oh, i gtuess its not as much a security risk because they'd have to inject script for that where if you eval they could pass it as a paramenter
[08:49:42] <phlp> Ariel_Calzada: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS3_Columns
[08:50:09] <is_null> hi all, how to know if there is a pending ajax request ?
[08:50:41] <is_null> my bad: how to know if jquery is still waiting for an ajax response
[08:51:11] <solidus-river> is_null: has the ajax response succeded or failed or called its .complete method?
[08:51:31] <solidus-river> probably wait till .complete is called
[08:53:12] <is_null> but i can't hack the complete method from code that is in external plugins
[08:53:36] <is_null> ajaxStop does what i want *in theory* but in practice it's not working
[08:55:53] <zerium1> is_null: you could make the ajax request synchronus...
[08:56:32] <is_null> well my autocomplete users won't like it a lot :D
[08:57:16] <Ariel_Calzada> phlp: what if i can't use CSS3 :(
[08:58:18] <phlp> Ariel_Calzada: good luck ;)
[09:00:04] <yurakeshi> there is any what to see if an element as an :hover style defined in css?
[09:00:06] <here4thegear> jquery ajax success: function()... if the page times out, success still runs but data is null. is there some other method I can add to handle this so that it skips success and lets me do something else?
[09:00:49] <here4thegear> I mean, if the call times out to not flag as a success
[09:03:47] <yurakeshi> here4thegear, timeout should callback the error function
[09:06:05] <bjhaid1> hi, please i am trying to execute  if if  (4101 == 4101) { $('#call').dialog('open'); } but it doesnt work, any reasons why, i expect it to pop-up the content of the call div tag
[09:07:00] <yurakeshi> bjhaid1, there is two ifs in ur code: if if...
[09:07:27] <bjhaid1> yurakeshi: the first if was a mistake, the code is if  (4101 == 4101) { $('#call').dialog('open'); }
[09:08:42] <bjhaid1> yurakeshi: any thoughts?
[09:08:58] <phlp> bjhaid1: has the dialog already been created elsewhere?
[09:09:05] <yurakeshi> bjhaid1, .dialog is an jquery-ui feature, isn't it?
[09:09:09] <emilkarl> Hi
[09:09:31] <bjhaid1> yurakeshi: yes
[09:09:42] <yurakeshi> bjhaid1, try ##jquery-ui or ##jqueryui-dev
[09:09:44] <bjhaid1> phlp: dialog is a jquery-ui feature
[09:09:48] <bjhaid1> okay
[09:09:50] <bjhaid1> thanks
[09:10:01] <here4thegear> yurakeshi: yeah but... it's not.. firefox is triggering success and returning null data
[09:10:23] <phlp> bjhaid1: yes i know but unless the dialog has already been created you need to use .dialog() to create it.. then you can use .dialog('open') or 'close'
[09:10:29] <tbranyen> yurakeshi: pretty sure this is the official support channel for jquery-ui
[09:11:03] <bjhaid1> phlp: thanks
[09:12:02] <Zzaichik> There's a channel called #jquery-ui
[09:17:59] <bjhaid1> phlp: please have a look at http://pastie.org/2243581
[09:25:52] <stuffmc> Hi
[09:26:06] <stuffmc> Is it the right IRC to ask a question about jQuery UI?
[09:26:09] <stuffmc> draggable/dropable
[09:27:36] <stuffmc> actually I found the answer ;-) see you soon folks
[09:29:37] <pLk> hi people
[09:29:42] <swiggy> is there a way to assign the .keyup() event to my document?
[09:29:53] <swiggy> instead of a specific element?
[09:30:03] <bakers> swiggy: You can assign it to "window"
[09:30:03] <swiggy> $(document).keyup()??
[09:30:11] <bakers> $("window").keyup()
[09:30:20] <bakers> wait no
[09:30:25] <bakers> $(window).keyup()
[09:31:24] <bakers> Or you can do document
[09:31:26] <swiggy> $(document).keyup() also works
[09:31:31] <swiggy> yah i just used document
[09:32:51] <swiggy> how do i assign an event to fire for a 2key-press? (ie:   ctrl+a == do something)
[09:33:04] <swiggy> i am logging event.keyCode
[09:33:10] <swiggy> but its not correct
[09:33:28] <gadlol> hi to all. Does .not() takes two selectors? exm: $(this).not('.class1 , .class2'); I use it like this but does not work
[09:34:04] <bakers> gadlol: Chain it $(this).not('.class1').not('.class2');
[09:34:53] <gadlol> xmmm it would be nice if i could put them all in one not()
[09:35:58] <swiggy> bakers, do you know how to do a 2-key event? (ie: ctrl+a)
[09:37:07] <bakers> swiggy: Sure http://www.fpaste.org/WxwJ/
[09:37:39] <swiggy> just wondering - why do you use keydown instead of keyup?
[09:38:07] <bakers> swiggy: I don't think it really matters
[09:38:36] <Cork[home]> swiggy: you sould really use keypress instead of keydown or keyup
[09:38:53] <Cork[home]> as thouse don't trigger on the key repeat
[09:38:59] <swiggy> ah
[09:39:13] <swiggy> yeah i tend to use keyup instead of down, just personal preference
[09:39:17] <Engin> can I sort (swap) children of an element according to a attribute of them ?
[09:39:36] <Engin> I'm looking for a easy way because of laziness
[09:40:10] <swiggy> bakers, in your example you are using altKey -- whats the equivalent for control?
[09:40:12] <swiggy> cntrl?
[09:40:19] <bakers> firebug the event
[09:40:21] <bakers> I think it's ctrlKey
[09:40:28] <swiggy> it returns a keycode
[09:40:32] <bakers> swiggy: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[09:40:39] <swiggy> ty
[09:41:12] <wookiehangover> anyone have a preference of tooltip plugin
[09:42:02] <Cork[home]> Engin: var elm1 = $('elm[your-attribute="1"]'); var elm2 = $('elm[your-attribute="2"]'); var sibling1 = elm1.prev(); elm1.after(elm1); elm2.after(sibling1);
[09:42:38] <Cork[home]> you could make a nice littel wrapper function if you like :)
[09:43:38] <threexk> hello.  How can you prevent infinite recursion with this:   a = foo.myfunc; foo.myfunc = function( a.call(); do_something_else(); );
[09:43:45] <threexk> I am trying to override a function.
[09:43:51] <bakers> wookiehangover: http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/stylish-jquery-tooltip-plugins-webdesign/
[09:43:53] <swiggy> hmmm
[09:44:18] <swiggy> Cork[home], keypress doesnt show the keyCode via   console.log(event.keyCode)
[09:44:25] <swiggy> it returns 0 for every key ..
[09:45:01] <swiggy> $(document).keypress(function(event){ console.log(event.keyCode); });
[09:45:04] <swiggy> returns 0
[09:45:06] <swiggy> weird
[09:45:15] <bakers> swiggy: Just log event
[09:46:22] <threexk> Correction: a = foo.myfunc; foo.myfunc = function( a.call(this); do_something_else(); );
[09:46:32] <swiggy> keycode is still 0
[09:46:43] <swiggy> i have a charCode
[09:46:45] <swiggy> but not a keycode
[09:47:00] <pLk> are questions allowed about jquery plugins that don't want to work? like fancybox, colorbox... :D
[09:47:05] <wookiehangover> bakers: thanks, did you google that
[09:47:12] <mven> Yo
[09:47:18] <Engin> Cork[home], i was imagining a $('#foo>.bar').sortBy('attr') :)
[09:47:20] <bakers> wookiehangover: Yes... I've use qtip and it's decent
[09:47:24] <wookiehangover> I was asking for an opinion, not the first google result
[09:47:41] <Engin> anyway, i think this approach is broken for my design anyway
[09:47:44] <bakers> wookiehangover: My opinion is qtop
[09:47:47] <bakers> qtip
[09:49:05] <mven> can anyone translate the following?
[09:49:07] <mven> $('<ul/>',{'class': 'my-new-list', html: items.join('')}).appendTo('body');});
[09:50:29] <mven> well the latter parts are self explanatory, but is jquery creating a new element by the $('<ul/>' call ?
[09:50:32] <Merrick> does something else need to be done for show() hide() to work in ie7?
[09:50:32] <mikeischris> Hi everyone, so far I have gotten my code working to fade a menu on hover and fade it back in on mouse out....however, I only want this code to execute if a secondary menu is present
[09:50:54] <mikeischris> how can i check if a div is present before this code is executed - http://pastebin.com/TkWatyPr
[09:50:55] <GeO`> hi
[09:51:06] <GeO`> can I use an effect when I change the value of a UI progressbar ?
[09:51:09] <guy> guys, the images on the left side (the small ones) keep jumping (ever second or so) in IE. and I don't understand what is causing it http://anuary.com/svn/hp/pad/index.html# IE7
[09:51:24] <GeO`> with .progressbar({value: 100});
[09:54:00] <yurakeshi> there is any what to check if an element as an :hover style defined in his css?
[09:56:03] <ryrych> hi
[09:57:43] <ryrych> .mouseup() is not fired after a drag in ie8 â€“ it works in Fx and Chrome but won't in ie; what do you suggest?
[09:59:18] <mikeischris> why is my if statement not working - http://pastebin.com/n8UQB94B
[10:00:06] <oxez> $("input[name=someName.something]") Is there a way to use something like that? I get an error in firebug: InternalError: regular expression too complex (jquery 1.4.3)

[10:01:26] <oxez> woops, nvm
[10:02:42] <grid_> hey
[10:02:58] <yurakeshi> oxez, if .something is a class: input[name=someName].something
[10:03:26] <oxez> yurakeshi: I had name="someName.something", using input[name='someName.something'] worked
[10:03:38] <grid_> how do i prefent this modal dialog to autoload when i open this page: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/dialog/modal.html ? i just want to open it with a hyperlink, the hyperlink already works, but i don't want it to open automatically
[10:03:45] <mikeischris> can anyone help with my if statement
[10:04:09] <guy> anyone?
[10:04:37] <Michael> mikeischris, imho you should add a comparison for readability. Treating > 0 as true is a C practice
[10:04:52] <Michael> It's arcane and not as readable
[10:05:21] <yurakeshi> oxez great ^^
[10:06:14] <mikeischris> Michael: Ok...but that shouldnt be stopping the code from working should it
[10:07:13] <Cork[home]> Michael: your sure the events trigger?
[10:07:32] <Michael> Cork[home], I didn't ask any questions
[10:07:34] <Cork[home]> and have you tested that the rest of the code works if you remove the if statement?
[10:07:44] <Cork[home]> Michael: opps sorry wrong nich :x
[10:07:45] <Michael> You directing to the wrong guy :)
[10:07:48] <Michael> np
[10:07:51] <Michael> "you're"
[10:08:00] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: that was for you :)
[10:08:42] <mikeischris> Michael: yes, it runs otherwise
[10:08:52] <Cork[home]> heh
[10:09:03] <Michael> mikeischris, What is the value of length at that point?
[10:09:12] <Michael> That will tell you why the if statement is failing
[10:09:14] <threexk> Why does a = b; b = function(a.call(this);); cause infinite recursion, but if I add the var keyword like "var a = b;", it does not?
[10:09:27] <mikeischris> i have a secondary menu
[10:09:34] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: you think you could create a testcase on jsfiddle?
[10:09:56] <mikeischris> and I just want the primary to fade out if the secondary is present, so I use the if to check if it is
[10:09:57] <grid_> i already solved my question
[10:10:38] <GeO`> guys, can I use an animation to move a progressbar ?
[10:11:13] <Cork[home]> GeO`: you mean a jqueryui or html5 progress bar?
[10:11:26] <GeO`> jquery ui
[10:11:30] <Cork[home]> then yes you can
[10:11:38] <GeO`> I don't find any doc about it
[10:11:52] <Cork[home]> you would have to extend the original plugin
[10:12:07] <GeO`> oh
[10:12:37] <GeO`> how so?
[10:12:38] <thiouzz> hello, any body can help me with this ?
[10:12:39] <thiouzz> uncaught exception: [Exception... "prompt aborted by user" nsresult: "0x80040111
[10:13:18] <Cork[home]> man that error rings so familiar...
[10:14:28] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: your getting this on an ajax call?
[10:14:34] <thiouzz> yes
[10:14:42] <Cork[home]> where do you start it from?
[10:14:50] <Cork[home]> a link, form?
[10:14:55] <Cork[home]> button?
[10:14:58] <thiouzz> link
[10:15:13] <Cork[home]> do you run event.preventDefault() first?
[10:15:31] <Cork[home]> (before the ajax call)
[10:15:47] <thiouzz> no
[10:15:55] <thiouzz> nothing before
[10:15:57] <Cork[home]> .click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.ajax(...); });
[10:16:13] <thiouzz> $("a#mycontacts").mousedown (
[10:16:13] <thiouzz>         	    function () {
[10:16:13] <thiouzz>         			$("#main-content-home").html('<img src="/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading ...');
[10:16:13] <thiouzz>         	        $.ajax({
[10:16:16] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: else the page will unload and the ajax call be stopped
[10:16:24] <gnarf> ?p @thiouzz
[10:16:25] <bot-t> thiouzz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:16:38] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: and you should bind to click and not mousedown
[10:16:40] <gnarf> don't dump more than 1 line in IRC plz
[10:16:48] <thiouzz> yeah I try it
[10:16:50] <thiouzz> the same
[10:16:51] <Cork[home]> so keyboard navigators can still use it
[10:17:09] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: with the reventDefault call?
[10:17:14] <Cork[home]> *prevent
[10:17:20] <thiouzz> click
[10:17:23] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: http://jsfiddle.net/cxGNp/
[10:17:30] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: do both
[10:17:30] <thiouzz> I try your code
[10:17:32] <thiouzz> ok
[10:18:57] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: perfect
[10:19:02] * Cork[home] goes into debug mode
[10:19:02] <thiouzz> that works .. thx Cork (thumb up)
[10:20:13] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: the if statement works
[10:20:22] <Cork[home]> but you effectivly hide them all anyway
[10:20:44] <Cork[home]> as the event queue is mouseout (old element) mouseover (new element)
[10:21:09] <thiouzz> srry was disconnected, was saying thx Cork
[10:22:08] <Cork[home]> thiouzz: ya it got through, and your wellcome
[10:22:21] <thiouzz> you was explaining smth ?
[10:24:08] <g0bl1n> in a Table, can one add a cloned row after a selected TR element ? using appendTo(row) appends as if were TD's
[10:25:03] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: I'm pretty new to JS...I=by itself the code works...so I thought the if statement would cause it not to run unless the parameter was met
[10:25:24] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: In this case, the second menu being present
[10:27:09] <g0bl1n> this is, can one add a new TR element in a table ?
[10:28:26] <fission6> i can't figure out the issue here, looking for help from somewhere "wise" with jquery loading, it looks like jquery-ui is blocking page resources and i cant figure out the optimal way to avoid this or if this is the case at all - http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=ay3wjo&s=7 here is a screenshot of resources loading
[10:29:13] <yurakeshi> how can i check if an element has an :hover style defined or how can i get all elements that have an :hover style?
[10:29:54] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: i'm not sure but this might be what your looking for http://jsfiddle.net/cxGNp/2/
[10:32:35] <g0bl1n> yurakeshi, $('.someRow:hover');
[10:32:58] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: not quite... what I am trying to get right is the conditional statement to only run this code if the .region-community-bar is present
[10:34:19] <jbrokc> what's the best way to determine the selector of an object in a case statement with jquery?
[10:34:23] <g0bl1n> yurakeshi, $('.yourtableRow:hover').length is live, so it even returns 1 or 0. Test in Chrome console
[10:34:23] <jbrokc> or switch block that is
[10:36:47] <fission6> so can i get away with putting jquery-ui at the bottom of my page?
[10:37:01] <g0bl1n> wont .appendto() work in TR elements ? Works fine for Table but tying to add a TR in the middle of a Table won't seem to work. Should not be newRow.appendTo(middleRow) ?
[10:37:13] <systemfault> Wait what? jQuery's selector supports :hover?
[10:37:31] <g0bl1n> systemfault, yes, just tested in Chrome
[10:37:51] <systemfault> Weird.. ok :)
[10:37:53] <g0bl1n> systemfault, returning 0 or 1 if mouse if hovering or not
[10:37:54] <ajpiano> no.
[10:38:18] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: you mean you want to trigger mouseover/out only on them?
[10:38:20] <ajpiano> QSA does, i think
[10:38:22] <ajpiano> but jQuery doesn't
[10:38:41] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, no ? :hover ?
[10:39:00] <ajpiano> jQuery(":hover") is not a supported thing
[10:39:19] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, but works in my example :-)
[10:39:28] <ajpiano> try it in IE
[10:39:47] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, oh ok, I refered it to Chrome
[10:41:03] <Cork[home]> wow temp01, long time no see
[10:41:10] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: Also, it seems that your code doesnt work like my original one
[10:41:53] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: all i got from your original one was a huge bunch of links that flickered then went back to hidden
[10:43:03] <DimmuR> Hello everyone. Is there any ready-to-use widget for input with some button and select with multichoice - that adds values from input to select?
[10:43:23] <jbrokc> so i want to build a switch statement that has case statements for the objects selector. for instance - `case $(this) when ".foo" then do(something) when "#bar" do(something.else)` but I have no idea how to do that, even with jquery. anyone know?
[10:44:33] <ax99> jbrokc: you can use $('.common-selector').each(function(){ evaluate one by one here })
[10:44:44] <ajpiano> jbrokc see ?is
[10:44:45] <jbrokc> ax99: what would that look like with my example?
[10:45:00] <ajpiano> if ($(this).is(".foo")) { }
[10:45:11] <fission6> where should i cinclude jquery? in head or before </body>
[10:45:16] <ajpiano> before body
[10:45:40] <fission6> ok
[10:45:41] <DimmuR> in head and before body :>
[10:46:04] <ax99> jbrokc: you can use $('.common-selector').each(function(){ if ($(this).is(".foo")) { } }) like this?
[10:46:33] <croby> is there any danger in providing just a Number to .text() instead of a string -- ie $(elt).text(1)? it seems to handle the type coercion just fine, but I want to make sure there aren't any hidden issues with it
[10:46:47] <systemfault> ax99: .filter?
[10:47:15] <fission6> ajpiano, what about all my jquery code, like $(document).ready(function() { these can't go in head anymore either
[10:47:39] <jbrokc> i'm trying to see if a given object is one of a multitude of unique id's. is it `switch (obj) { case "#foo" do(something) case ".bar" do(something.else) }`
[10:47:45] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: I'm sorry for the sloppy work...I fixed it up - http://jsfiddle.net/cxGNp/3/
[10:48:15] <systemfault> jbrokc: Ok?
[10:48:17] <jbrokc> so, is there any jquery method that's both hasClass and hasId in one?
[10:48:21] <djQuery> I need to pull an item out of an array and insert it back in a different place in the array
[10:48:57] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: so currently onload, the main menu fades, but on mouseover, it comes back to 100%. Now what I want to do is to make it dependent on the presence of the secondary menu
[10:49:01] <systemfault> jbrokc: .is ?
[10:49:10] <mikeischris> on pages where it is not present, I would not want ot have the fade
[10:49:36] * Cork[home] gives it another try
[10:49:38] <jbrokc> systemfault: you cant' do switch ($(this).is()) { case "#foo" do(something) } far as i know
[10:49:38] <ax99> ahm well, you can use the selector for evaluating the quantity.. and then get if you have to use # or .
[10:49:56] <fission6> ajpiano, any thoughts?
[10:50:12] <systemfault> jbrokc: But that's not what you asked.. :/
[10:50:16] <ajpiano> fission6: you should load scripts at the bottom of the body
[10:50:31] <ajpiano> jbrokc: why do you want a switch
[10:50:33] <fission6> whata bout actual code though, where should that go like $(document).ready(function() {
[10:50:37] <yurakeshi> g0bl1n, thanks, but it only works om Chrome.
[10:50:42] <ajpiano> it seems like a really inelegant place for a switch
[10:50:51] <jbrokc> ajpiano: what would be a better approach?
[10:51:01] <ajpiano> depends on the context
[10:51:29] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: sorry if i miss understood, but is this what your after? http://jsfiddle.net/cxGNp/4/
[10:51:33] <fission6> ajpiano, where should actual jquery code go if jquery is included at th ebottom of body? like for instance $(document).ready(function() { code
[10:51:39] <djQuery> mikeischris: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/cxGNp/5/
[10:51:51] <ajpiano> after it
[10:51:53] <ajpiano> duh
[10:51:59] <fission6> but still inside body
[10:52:08] <systemfault> fission6: actually, if the scripts are at the end of the body, .ready is not even necessary afaik
[10:52:20] <fission6> well sure that could be a reasonable case
[10:52:41] <fission6> so it should look like ....... <script jquery></script><script>my jquery</script></body>
[10:52:56] <systemfault> Yeah.
[10:53:13] <systemfault> As long as jquery is loaded before the scripts using it, it should be fine.
[10:53:14] <fission6> ok let me refactor
[10:53:24] <fission6> thanks ajpiano and systemfault
[10:53:37] <g0bl1n> yurakeshi, yes ajpiano confirmed it. Not supported yet
[10:54:44] <sv_in1> Good evening
[10:56:16] <yurakeshi> g0bl1n, no problem, thanks. i'll try another aproach
[10:57:30] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: your code works
[10:57:41] <mikeischris> djQuery: this doesnt work
[10:57:44] <g0bl1n> yurakeshi, ;)
[10:57:58] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: mouseenter/leave is a life saver ;)
[10:58:44] <fission6> thank god this isn templates and i can move blocks around to the bottom, helps refactoring greatly
[10:58:50] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: However, how do I make it conditional, so it only works when the .region-community-bar is present
[11:00:15] <ryrych> do you know how to trigger .mouseup() after drag (mousedown() and mousemove()) on images?
[11:00:24] <ryrych> in ie8 of coz
[11:00:45] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: what do you want .re to do?
[11:00:53] <jbrokc> is there a character for backspace? something I can escape like "\d" or whatever?
[11:01:37] <g0bl1n> insertAfter() and appendTo() ftw!!
[11:01:42] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: .re is the region that contains the secondary menu....I dont want the main menu all the fade affects running unless the secondary menu is present
[11:02:03] <mikeischris> so if only the main menu is present, tit appears normally
[11:02:14] <mikeischris> if however .re is present, it fades out
[11:03:17] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: is .re a child to #menupbar or what?
[11:03:27] <Cork[home]> *menubar
[11:03:46] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: no, its a div, no relation
[11:03:59] <djQuery> mikeischris: then reverse the logic if(!$('secondmenu').length)
[11:04:10] <Cork[home]> so you want to not do the animation at all if its pressent on the page?
[11:04:36] <djQuery> jbrokc: &nbsp;
[11:05:08] <Cork[home]> mikeischris: http://jsfiddle.net/cxGNp/6/
[11:06:19] <Paolo_CT> Im using a fancybox (Colorbox), it works fine, but when I try to load some code using .load, every link (from the loaded code) that uses the colorbox class doesnt work at all
[11:06:42] <Paolo_CT> Does a fancybox works with the load funtion?
[11:06:53] <grid_> i want to open a javascript event show(); when i close my jquery ui popup, here is a very clear example howto do that http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close , could someone give me a example howto add show(); to it? the name of my ui dialog is #dialog-modal" here is my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/uykjz/
[11:07:40] <djQuery> mikeischris: Cork[home]: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/cxGNp/7/
[11:08:12] <ryrych> anyone please?
[11:08:57] <djQuery> grid_: so if they close it you want to show it? .dialog({close: function(){ $(this).dialog(show); }}
[11:09:07] <djQuery> well show should be in '
[11:10:10] <Cork[home]> djQuery: didn't know how dynamic the menu could be, so didn't go there :)
[11:10:12] <djQuery> grid_: the thing is that close will fire even on buttons that u add to the dialog I think
[11:10:16] <jbrokc> what's the best way of subtracting the last character from a string with jquery
[11:10:43] <grid_> djQuery: show is an external event anyways, it has nothing do to with jquery ui, ok, you mean .dialog({close: function(){ $(this).dialog('show'); }} ? at this moment i have no buttons yet, soon i will add hyperlinks
[11:10:48] <djQuery> ?jsisjs@jbrokc
[11:10:50] <ax99> jbrokc: string.substring(0,string.length-1);
[11:10:59] <ax99> ?!
[11:10:59] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[11:11:00] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 24 minutes and 34 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[11:11:24] <djQuery> every time I come on bot-t leaves
[11:12:19] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: nope....if you change the name of the class and run it, the code still executes
[11:12:58] <djQuery> grid_: you dont need to add hyper links .dialog accepts a set of buttons.   .dialog({close: domyfunc, buttons: [OK: function(){ $(this).dialog('close');}]})
[11:20:05] <M0wLaue> http://tiny.cc/zklti
[11:20:58] <grid_> djQuery: i'm not sure how i will add it to my page source
[11:21:13] <grid_> djQuery: do you want me to setup a jsfiddle post?
[11:25:23] <danut> Hi, can anybody help me?
[11:26:57] <yurakeshi> danut, don't ask to ask, just ask
[11:27:55] <grid_> djQuery: ok, well i only want to execute .show() when i press esc or when i press the right corner little x, this will fire of something that i need
[11:28:11] <danut> I had 4 select boxex and on each ones I bind an event. Aftertahat, I put a "reset button" selecteing first option of each select. But when I click, once of reset each select lance  ther ajax call :( How can I avoid that?
[11:28:47] <danut> Is about change avent I binded
[11:28:56] <djQuery> $(document).delegate('
[11:29:36] <madprops> any idea why this works for videos in the main div and not on others?
[11:29:37] <madprops> http://dpaste.com/572533/
[11:34:02] <Paolo_CT> Finally fix it, for the logs:
[11:34:05] <Paolo_CT> Needed to use .live()
[11:34:06] <Paolo_CT> Here is an example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/907771/need-a-jquery-lightbox-plugin-that-supports-live-and-grouping
[11:35:49] <danut> Seems nobody see my question. I put again: So, I have 4 select boxes, each with change event bind, function containing a ajax call. I have, also a button for reseting selection ( .val('')  ). The problem is, when I click the button, due the value changes, each select run their change code. How can I avoid?
[11:36:40] <danut> I want the change event lanch just once
[11:37:43] <skiz> danut: bind, prevent default, and unbind them within the reset?
[11:37:48] <SoulRaven> any one used dataTables and tabletools?
[11:39:41] <systemfault> danut: Perhaps you could use .click instead of change
[11:39:43] <danut> .. sorry.. too fast for me ;) so, where or when prevent default?  I don't whant to unbind, because, after that I need again bind..
[11:40:09] <abjorn> Penicillin is a wonder drug, I love it.
[11:40:21] <systemfault> abjorn: I love it, my body doesn't.
[11:40:28] <systemfault> Allergic.
[11:40:33] <abjorn> ah man that sucks
[11:40:37] <madprops> any idea why this works for videos in the main div and not on others? http://dpaste.com/572533/
[11:40:41] <danut> Hm.. I'll try with click
[11:42:27] <madprops> how can I turn this var $allVideos = $("iframe[src^='http://www.youtube.com']"), to get videos from a certain div ?
[11:42:31] <fumanchu182> Would there be a reason that .bind() would not work in a plugin?  DOM not fully loaded?
[11:42:32] <danut> No, .click isn't a solution
[11:42:56] <SoulRaven> any one used dataTables and tabletools?
[11:43:08] <danut> Because the event trigger twice, when dropdown the list and when select
[11:45:04] <danut> any other opinion?
[11:45:32] <jayd3e> can anyone point me to an intermediate tutorial on how to properly program in javascript?  I know the syntax and such, I just want to learn how large javascript projects are commonly organized
[11:45:59] <djQuery> danut: $('select').addClass('changeable'); $(document).delegate('select.changeable', 'change', function(){ your origina function here. }); $('#reset').click(function(){ $('changeable').removeClass('changeable').val('').addClass('changeable');})
[11:46:00] <jayd3e> I just would like some kind of project/tutorial that takes me to the next level in javascript
[11:46:34] <KWhat_Work> Is there a way in jquery to handle function overloading easily or should i just write my own code in a function to do it
[11:46:42] <djQuery> danut: by using delegate with a specific class I can basicaly typorarily disable the change event from firing
[11:47:05] <danut> yes... thx I think is a good solution
[11:47:17] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: I havent been able to solve the problem, but just wanted to say thanks for you help thus far
[11:48:31] <Cork[home]> np
[11:49:46] <rudi> i got this object - http://cl.ly/2l3I3X0x2e3M0J0Q0u16 which is not array ... and .each does not work ... how to create array ?
[11:50:08] <tbranyen> rudi: each works on more than arrays
[11:53:18] <fractaloop> If I use a $('#main').load('foo.html #data') I end up with the <div id="data"> in #main. How can I only load what's inside #data into #main?
[11:54:16] <Cork[home]> fractaloop: if you don't absolutly have to you shouldn't load data that way
[11:54:34] <Cork[home]> fractaloop: its waistfull as you still have to download and parse the entire html document
[11:54:35] <fractaloop> Okay, so I'm really just making a Navigation menu....
[11:55:24] <fractaloop> Just trying to make ajax page loads...
[11:55:24] <Cork[home]> fractaloop: if you have so you can use server scripts, make it so you can request just the parts you need
[11:55:41] <Cork[home]> instead of requesting the entire html file
[11:55:53] <fractaloop> I'm using Jekyll to make a static site, so there are no server scripts anywhere
[11:56:05] <Cork[home]> ouch
[11:56:30] <Cork[home]> fractaloop: well back to your question, no thats how .load works
[11:56:43] <fractaloop> Argh~
[11:57:02] <Cork[home]> fractaloop: you could add another element with an id in it and it should work just fine
[11:57:09] <fractaloop> Yea, I guess.
[11:57:18] <fractaloop> divitus for sure
[11:57:23] <Cork[home]> yup :)
[11:58:56] <grid_> djQuery: i made some time to make a jsfiddle post http://jsfiddle.net/T8WMz/ when you open one of the links you will see that the google logo will disappear, this will do the event hide(); with the onlick event, it would show up again with show(); , i want to .show(); it again when i close any of the popups, this has to do with http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close ? maybe you can edit my jsfiddle?
[12:02:57] <phrontist> I've got a bunch of input elements inside "li" elements that I'm validating with the validate plugin
[12:02:58] <phlp> grid_: .dialog({ close: show }) add the option to your others
[12:03:07] <jayd3e> can anyone point me to an intermediate tutorial on how to properly program in javascript?  I know the syntax and such, I just want to learn how large javascript projects are commonly organized
[12:03:25] <djQuery> grid_: then its just .dialog({modal: true, show: false, close: show})
[12:03:45] <phrontist> I'd like to add a certain css class to the parent li element when there is an error, and add a different one (that should replace the previous) when it validates correctly
[12:03:56] <phrontist> what callback should I use?
[12:03:59] <phrontist> errorplacement?
[12:04:56] <djQuery> phrontist: have the li always have the good css class then just toggle the bad one.    $(this).closest('li').toggleClass('bad');
[12:05:15] <grid_> djQuery: i'm not really a good programmer, where do you add that line?
[12:05:30] <phrontist> djQuery: in which callback should I be doing that though?
[12:05:35] <djQuery> grid_: where you declare you dialog
[12:06:51] <djQuery> $('a.dialo').dialog({open: hide, close: show, modal: true, display: false}).click(function(){ $(this).dialog('show');})
[12:06:51] <colin3440> what's the easiest way to check if a string starts with "markerZip"?
[12:07:16] <grid_> djQuery: can you add that line to my post?
[12:07:41] <grid_> http://jsfiddle.net/T8WMz/
[12:08:38] <phrontist> to pose my question different: jquery will add the "error" class to the input appopriately - how can I have it added to the parent class as well? which callback is called?
[12:09:16] <phlp> colin3440: /^markerZip./.test('markerZip123')
[12:10:05] <colin3440> thanks phlp
[12:10:52] <yurakeshi> is possible to use .css() to change the style of an element without killing the css :hover effect? I mean, only change the style to the default state
[12:11:34] <kollapse> Hi. I'm using buttonset to create a set of buttons. This jquery ui function implicitly adds .ui-corner-left and .ui-corner-right classes to the first and last elements of the set to smoothen them out and create that nice effect. But if the set of buttons is too large and it stretches out to multiple lines, the first and last buttons on the newlines are not smoothen the same. Any way to implement this ?
[12:12:05] <fumanchu182> Well I'm officially stumped.  My plugin will bind to some elements and miss others, however debug output on the "this" object shows me they are being hit by the each function.  If anyone has any ideas they would be greatly appreciated: http://pastebin.com/vjS18dcK
[12:12:12] <phlp> colin3440: this also matches if it's exactly the same /^markerZip.*/.test('markerZip')
[12:13:29] <yurakeshi> kollapse, either fix the issue on the source code or extend the function
[12:14:17] <kollapse> yurakeshi: I'm not sure I know how to detect if an element breaks to a newline.
[12:14:24] <grid_> djQuery/phlp: it works already, i didnt know it could be done so easy
[12:14:43] <nerdshark|work> hey guys, i have a jquery ajax call that's requesting some jsonp from a web service i wrote. the ajax call works fine in desktop browsers (tested in firebug on pages w/ jquery, and on jsfiddle), but not in an android phonegap app. are there any caveats i'm missing regarding jquery, ajax/jsonp, and phonegap? here's my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Tsg7t/
[12:14:54] <djQuery> grid the whole thing could probably be done easier
[12:15:48] <yurakeshi> kollapse, check if the width of the line is small then the sum of the elements plus the space between them.
[12:18:56] <grid_> djQuery: you mean the script that will hide my div? i could use a style block or none, but this will not work with windows media player objects, or do you mean something different?
[12:19:15] <grid_> atleast the stream will stop playing with firefox
[12:19:30] <yurakeshi> kollapse, maybe ##jqueryui-dev can be helpfull to you
[12:20:05] <kollapse> yurakeshi: Hmm, possibly I could use the .offset().left
[12:20:05] <swiggy> var id = tinymce.replace('slidetext');
[12:20:12] <swiggy> replace is not a function.... wth
[12:20:40] <kollapse> yurakeshi: Apply it to the first element and then calculate a max variable like I would progress on a line and when the next offset is less than max it means it broke to a newline and thus I can apply to that element as well.
[12:25:56] <kollapse> Hmm. Which one of these would be faster ? for (i=0; i<100; i++) { $("#myDiv"+i).doSomething(); } OR $(".myDiv").each(function(){ this.doSomething(); });
[12:28:02] <phrontist> how can I change the error message for an error type, e.g. "required"?
[12:31:17] <phlp> kollapse: http://jsperf.com/each-vs-for2/10
[12:34:21] <kollapse> phlp: Interesting. Thanks.
[12:34:43] <kollapse> each seems to be much slower.
[12:35:49] <phlp> the 3rd and 4th are what you asked about. they are fairly similar. each is a little faster, but not sure why they put i in an array to send to .eq
[12:37:50] <fumanchu182> Okay I just noticed my custom jQuery plugin initializing twice.  I've followed the pattern in the documentation...
[12:54:16] <colin3440> why is this function (removeZipMarkers) only removing every other array item when run? http://jsfiddle.net/c3aUT/
[12:57:27] <ChampS_> hi
[12:58:34] <ChampS_> http://jsfiddle.net/RNN8Q/ <<< the first alert work but the second not
[12:58:57] <phlp> colin3440: http://jsfiddle.net/c3aUT/1
[12:59:19] <ChampS_> dont know why the alert(result1) is true but if( result1 == "true") is not true ._.
[13:00:12] <ChampS_> anyone a idea?
[13:00:40] <yurakeshi> ChampS_ try if( result1 == true)
[13:01:22] <ChampS_> test it
[13:01:26] <ChampS_> but doesnt work
[13:01:58] <colin3440> phlp: thanks! however, I don't think I can do it that way.. each item in the markersArray that matches the regex also is removed from google maps. So I think I do need to find everything that matches instead of everything that doesn't.
[13:02:29] <colin3440> phlp: http://jsfiddle.net/c3aUT/2/
[13:04:09] <jkarayusuf> @ChampS_ alert(result1) is true because result1 is not 'null' or 'undefined'
[13:04:14] <jkarayusuf> that does not mean it is == 'true'
[13:04:25] <phlp> colin3440: this wont work? http://jsfiddle.net/c3aUT/3
[13:04:30] <ChampS_> no!
[13:05:30] <ChampS_> its true cause there is a echo true in the phpfile if i write the right logindata
[13:05:39] <ChampS_> if not result1 is false
[13:05:52] <m0dmd> what's going on everybody.
[13:06:03] <jkarayusuf> result1 should be a javascript object
[13:06:04] <m0dmd> hope you're all doing good.
[13:06:34] <phlp> ChampS_: maybe if($.trim(result1) == "true")
[13:07:13] <m0dmd> anyone have any links to the jquery tricks that involve making an element scroll down a container elements if it is no longer visible
[13:07:23] <zoned> i'm trying to get a form element from formid="step2Form" where the type is "radio" and it has a "code" attribute of 'H' .... can someone help me with the syntax please?
[13:07:33] <m0dmd> i gotta keep a small navigation on the screen, but don't want it to overlay content
[13:08:24] <ChampS_> owwwww
[13:08:28] <ChampS_> it works
[13:08:29] <ChampS_> arg
[13:08:32] <ChampS_> thanks
[13:08:33] <m0dmd> this stuff is all over the place.
[13:08:44] <colin3440> phlp: that worked! why didn't my first way work?
[13:09:29] <phlp> colin3440: you cant modify the array while you are iterating over it
[13:09:48] <colin3440> well that's good to know. thank you!
[13:10:14] <phlp> zoned: $('#step2Form').find('input:radio[code="H"]')
[13:11:25] <jjb123> Hey guys I need some help with an IE jquery bug I'm having that I can't seem to fix. Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/H5E68fA7 Here's what is looks like in firefox (correct): http://i.imgur.com/xE7BW.png and IE (broken): http://i.imgur.com/2LGd8.png I have no idea how to fix this and any help at all would be appreciated!
[13:11:55] <zoned> phlp: thanks!
[13:12:35] <dr34mc0d3r> looking at http://awesomescreenshot.com/0fcgzc94f   got any ideas on creating the ruler just above the UI slider??
[13:13:01] <dr34mc0d3r> the range is dynamic so the ruler cant be an image.
[13:13:59] <mikeischris> Cork[home]: ++

[13:15:33] <illmatix> is there a simple way to have a menu item that would be the login link if the user is logged out and the "my account" while the user is logged in?
[13:15:47] <illmatix> oops wrong channel
[13:16:06] <dr34mc0d3r> i saw that - but the client has a lot of work in the UI slider - im just wanting to add to the "widget"
[13:17:20] <zulax> I need to fireup constant ajax call when the user is only in a certain page (without doing any clicks from user side), what are good ways to achieve this?
[13:18:02] <kollapse> Hi. If I do $("selector").buttonset(); for(...) { do(); } then the for will get executed while the first command is running rather than after.
[13:18:06] <kollapse> Any way to do this sinchronously ?
[13:18:18] <dr34mc0d3r> <zulax> - fire your ajax call inside a setinterval ?
[13:18:49] <zulax> dr34mc0d3r, to make sure it happends only in the right page, do i just check the url?
[13:18:57] <m0dmd> phlp do you know where i can find the tutorials for how to make an element always visible after scrolling but locked inside certain parent elements?
[13:19:19] <dr34mc0d3r> <zulax> - only include it on the right page...
[13:19:25] <zulax> ok
[13:19:56] <m0dmd> anyone know how i can word this crap so it can be easily understood
[13:19:56] <m0dmd> :)
[13:20:01] <jspath> anyone seen errors like this before using JSONP in IE9? {"jqXHR":{"readyState":4,"status":0,"statusText":"error"},"textStatus":"error","errorThrown":{"message":"Operation aborted\r\n","description":"Operation aborted\r\n","number":-2147467260}}
[13:20:15] <m0dmd> when the page is scrolled, i need an element to remain visible, but only confined to a specific container
[13:20:16] <phlp> m0dmd: there is position:fixed but it wont be locked inside any element
[13:20:23] <m0dmd> i know that
[13:20:37] <m0dmd> i do'nt want the element overlaying any content
[13:20:45] <Cork[home]> jspath: its a comment error number in any borwser
[13:20:47] <Cork[home]> *browser
[13:20:48] <m0dmd> there's bunch of sites that do it but i can't find the examples
[13:20:50] <rod> Hello!
[13:21:12] <Cork[home]> jspath: ajax error 0 means the ajax request has been called with xhr.abort()
[13:21:50] <Cork[home]> jspath: why you would get it as json is more then i know though
[13:22:04] <rod> If i use $.ajax and I do an inline callback function .... what kind of 'scope' does it have? can I reference a VAR that was made within the same scope that the $.ajax was called?  (a var created right before calling ajax)
[13:22:29] <Cork[home]> rod: exactly
[13:22:29] <jspath> Cork[home]: that's just how i ouput the error when i trapped it
[13:22:42] <Cork[home]> jspath: ok, then thats what happend
[13:23:11] <rod> hm awesome, thanks!
[13:23:11] <jspath> Cork[home]: so something is aborting the request?
[13:23:13] <Cork[home]> jspath: i use ajax queue my self, so i always have to catch that error (cause each time i abort an old call for an updted one, i get that one)
[13:23:19] <Cork[home]> jspath: yes
[13:24:27] <jspath> Cork[home]: hm, ok.  i'll have to dig a bit more i guess.  it's weird.  only IE9.  and we can't reproduce it inhouse :(
[13:28:25] <rod> Can anyone give me a hint as to why the statement $("#testDiv").html("REPLACE WITH AJAX!");  works fine OUTSIDE a $.ajax callback function but doesn't do anything inside the ajax callback function?  (The ajax GET is returning an OK 200)
[13:30:15] <KWhat_Work> rod: if i was to guess i would say the context is above where #testDiv is
[13:30:32] <KWhat_Work> context is below *
[13:30:33] <rod> what does 'context' mean
[13:30:50] <KWhat_Work> rod: what did you set context to in .ajax?
[13:31:00] <rod> default, smart guess
[13:31:28] <rod> I will try setting it to JSON
[13:31:42] <KWhat_Work> try setting it to context: document.body,
[13:31:54] <KWhat_Work> dataType is what gets set to json
[13:32:12] <rod> ohhh
[13:33:37] <GeO`> which library/method would you advise me to draw lines ?
[13:33:40] <rod> hmm OKAY, I set context to document.body  (The #testDiv is in the body) , but the statement doesn't work
[13:33:50] <rod> still
[13:34:00] <KWhat_Work> hmmm
[13:34:11] <KWhat_Work> the method getting called ?
[13:35:00] <rod> what do you mean
[13:35:34] <rod> the callback function in the $.ajax is just --- function( data ) {  $("#testDiv").html("REPLACE WITH AJAX!");  }
[13:36:42] <KWhat_Work> which callback you using, complete ?
[13:36:49] <KWhat_Work> paste the .jajax method
[13:36:56] <rod> okay
[13:37:25] <rod> http://pastebin.com/46QujdRX
[13:38:06] <black_warlock> hello guys
[13:38:41] <KWhat_Work> rod: should work, throw a console.log in there see if its actually getting executed
[13:38:57] <black_warlock> when i .load an external element inside a div is there a way to go back without to .load the previous div content ?
[13:39:37] <rod> firebug is telling me that the GET request the ajax is making is OK 200 , I will try and add the console.log and see what that does (never used console.log though)
[13:39:38] <black_warlock> a sorta of back function or referral reload ?
[13:39:42] <Cork[home]> black_warlock: only if you keep the old content alive
[13:40:34] <Cork[home]> black_warlock: you could do that by detaching a container or something like that
[13:40:35] <GeO`> which library/method would you advise me to draw lines ?
[13:41:05] <sacre2> I'm returning a function definition from AJAX and I was wondering how I could make sure that the function was being added to the active DOM after it gets returned by modifying the $.ajax() statement when I request the script
[13:41:05] <black_warlock> so Cork you mean if i charge all the elements i need inside the same page and move/show them from the same page
[13:41:25] <KWhat_Work> rod: console.log shows up in firebugs console
[13:42:13] <Cork[home]> black_warlock: well no, i meant you could "save" them when you replace the content
[13:42:40] <rod> ok i see firebug console, there is NO "hello world" from the console.log statement .... bug now on the firebug console I see my GET request being posted in RED letters with a big red X ... I guess that's bad.
[13:42:55] <rod> but*
[13:43:39] <Cork[home]> black_warlock: something like var old = $('<div/>'); old.append($container.children()); $container.load()
[13:44:00] <KWhat_Work> means yoru respnse was not 200
[13:44:42] <phrontist> I've got a jquery-validate rule set up for a phone number field
[13:44:46] <phrontist> I want the field to be optional
[13:44:57] <phrontist> but if they do enter something, I want it to be checked
[13:45:03] <Cork[home]> black_warlock: and when you want to go back you do $container.html(old.children())
[13:45:10] <sacre2> I'm returning a function definition from AJAX and I was wondering how I could make sure that the function was being added to the active DOM after it gets returned by modifying the $.ajax() statement when I request the script
[13:45:16] <phrontist> right now it's checked, but if I submit with an empty phone field, it throws an error
[13:46:13] <rod> uhh anyone know where I can get a link that returns XML or JSON to make sure it's not my local source of json that's the problem?
[13:46:38] <Cork[home]> rod: jsfiddle has test servers
[13:46:57] <phrontist> why might some validate rules be checked fine on key up, but not when submitted?
[13:47:14] <rod> hm great thanks Cork[home] ... lemme just check that out
[13:49:19] <rod> hmm I can visit http://jsfiddle.net/echo/jsonp/ in my browser just fine and download a JSON file.  But my $.ajax gives me  407 proxy denied error....any ideas?
[13:49:38] <djQuery> ?sop
[13:49:39] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:49:50] <djQuery> but that shouldnt affext a jsonp
[13:54:40] <jbrokc> how do i trigger the :active state of an element very quickly (as in, on and then off) with jquery?
[13:54:54] <imsky> o canada
[13:56:28] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: there is no active off
[13:57:03] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: and as far as i know you can't trigger active only :focus
[13:58:07] <jbrokc> wait - there's no way to trigger active?
[13:58:40] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: if you mean css :active, ya
[13:58:58] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: thats mouse interaction
[13:59:14] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: yeah, and i'm trying to make it show with the keyboard
[13:59:48] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: not posible, add an optional class in your css rule
[13:59:51] <Cork[home]> and toggle that
[14:00:15] <pr0ton> how do i get a tool tip of this type?
[14:00:31] <pr0ton> [.input...text.] <- [... tool tip ]
[14:00:38] <pr0ton> like a horizontal kinda thing
[14:01:25] <Cork[home]> pr0ton: you need a plugin like beautytip or jqtip
[14:01:36] <pr0ton> which is better? :)
[14:01:48] <pr0ton> i'd actually like something which has got active dev...
[14:02:06] <Cork[home]> beautytip can do google like baloons if your interested in things like that
[14:02:12] <Cork[home]> (and its the one i use)
[14:02:18] <Cork[home]> its not very activly developed
[14:02:49] <oDesk> how i can deal with the response data as an object ?
[14:02:59] <oDesk> so $(data).find() would work ?
[14:03:25] <Cork[home]> oDesk: yes
[14:03:35] <oDesk> the data contains   html <div></div> response
[14:04:17] <oDesk> Cork[home]: in my case $(data).find("div.mhs")  doesn't return any result
[14:05:07] <jbrokc> Cork[home]: for some reason, $("#key_spacebar").addClass("active").delay(2000).removeClass("active"); doesn't work for me
[14:06:37] <bot-t> jbrokc, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[14:06:44] <Cork[home]> jbrokc: delay is meant for animations
[14:06:48] <Cork[home]> ah

[14:10:00] <Cork[home]> silo: you your looking for css rules or elements?
[14:10:18] <silo> an element
[14:11:05] <silo> i have a load of divs, all set to height 0, I change their height using animate, when i open another one i need to animate any open one back to 0 height
[14:11:14] <silo> so i need a way of finding any divs that have height > 0
[14:11:25] <silo> just can't think how to do it...

[14:17:12] <black_warlock> Cork how can i save the content of an entire div inside that function
[14:18:01] <black_warlock> exemple : the div id where im working is <div id="superslider">
[14:18:34] <black_warlock> in this div im .loading the video then , after i watch video i have to go back to the slider
[14:18:56] <black_warlock> i did the first part well
[14:19:14] <black_warlock> the video is loaded inside the my div but cant go back
[14:21:10] <swiggy> anyone know of anything similiar to colorbox, but it creates a moveable window within the DOM? i have a page i want to load in a new window (but not window.open -- i need to keep the parent DOM's css)
[14:21:20] <swiggy> but colorbox doesnt let the `window` move
[14:21:33] <swiggy> it would be nice to be able to load pages into a jquery UI dialog
[14:21:39] <swiggy> that would be the ideal solution
[14:24:09] <Rushing> swiggy, you can do that pretty easily
[14:24:20] <Rushing> just make an ajax call and set it as the dialog's content
[14:24:26] <swiggy> i tried that
[14:24:45] <swiggy> i have javascript on my 'ajax' page
[14:24:49] <swiggy> that breaks the dialog
[14:25:10] <Rushing> well that'll probably happen with any overlay then
[14:25:30] <Rushing> you may need to adjust your script on the page if it's breaking the containing page
[14:26:52] <black_warlock> Cork i get error $conteiner is not a function
[14:28:10] <any-key> If I add a click function via $(".foo").click() and add a new element with class "foo" will that listener apply to it?
[14:29:08] <systemfault> any-key: No
[14:29:16] <any-key> damn
[14:29:24] <any-key> systemfault: thanks for the response
[14:29:29] <totallyvinny> anyone here familiar with malsups cycle plugin?
[14:29:34] <systemfault> Depending on your problem, you might want to check for .delegate or .live
[14:29:42] <systemfault> any-key: ^
[14:29:55] <any-key> I'll look into those, thanks
[14:30:15] <totallyvinny> using cycle plugin i am trying to show a preview of the next slide on hover of the next slide trigger. any ideas on how to accomplish this?

[14:32:26] <phrontist> I'm using jquery validate. I have "required" set on several fields, but when I click submit it skips past the first two and only shows error text for third, even though they;re all blank - why might that be?
[14:33:54] <rubyruy> is there a way to hang on to an event object that was stopped (using event.stopImmediatePropagation()) and then resume it later?
[14:34:30] <rubyruy> we're trying to implement a custom confim() dialog (using jquery dialogs, just because real modal dialogs freeze up background tabs which is undesirable)
[14:34:52] <rubyruy> and it would be great if it can be a drop-in solution that simply executes all existing handlers after you click OK
[14:34:56] <rubyruy> we could re-trigger the click event yes
[14:34:57] <snover> you could re-dispatch the event on the original target or on the element holding the handler that stopped it but you canâ€™t â€œcontinueâ€ it
[14:35:20] <rubyruy> the prob with re-dispatching is that i'll catch it again myself
[14:35:31] <rubyruy> in the confirm handler i mean
[14:35:37] <rubyruy> does that make sense?
[14:36:01] <rubyruy> no way to track if onclick i should show the confirm dialog or actually execute the handlers :/
[14:36:10] <rubyruy> well, no way outside globals and other nastyness
[14:36:36] <rubyruy> but fo sure events can't be put on standby and resumed? :/

I'm able to remove the selected attribute, however the browser doesn't change the selection of the option until I click somewhere on the page.  Using $("#newModel option:selected").removeAttr("selected");
[15:09:31] <black_warlock> are you sure it will read the var stored in the main page ?
[15:10:00] <cardguy1000> It's like the control needs to be refreshed.  http://dev.mcbridehomes.com/mockup/test.asp

[15:14:05] <Whirl3d> Good Evenin' all.
[15:14:13] <imsky> whoa wtf
[15:14:22] <imsky> abjorn: isn't that a little retro?

[15:19:01] <Whirl3d> ?ask
[15:19:02] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:19:10] <imsky> hi Whirl3d
[15:19:21] <Whirl3d> hey imsky, how goes it?
[15:19:33] <imsky> in photoshop, designing ;) you?
[15:19:56] <Whirl3d> love/hate photoshop....in NuSphere trying to code a jquery extension..
[15:20:13] <imsky> what's nusphere
[15:20:24] <Whirl3d> It's a php ide that I like a lot.
[15:20:37] <Whirl3d> it's actually NuSphere phped
[15:20:39] <Whirl3d> I think
[15:20:51] <imsky> ah pretty sweet
[15:21:01] <Whirl3d> What are you designing in ps?
[15:21:19] <imsky> social network :P
[15:21:23] <Whirl3d> fernandoaleman, ask your question
[15:21:30] <Whirl3d> icons? or something original?
[15:21:44] <imsky> oh, no, everything. layout, icons, the works
[15:22:02] <Whirl3d> Cool. Starting a new social network, huh?
[15:22:04] <Demia> fernandoaleman: as always the rule is, don't ask to ask, just ask.
[15:22:06] <imsky> shhhhh
[15:22:08] <imsky> shhhhh
[15:22:09] <cardguy1000> Does anyone know if you remove an attribute from an select element, such as removing the selected attribute if you need to somehow refresh the select element?  I've successfully removed the select attribute by $("#newModel option:selected").removeAttr("selected"); but you have to click off the control for it to update in the browser
[15:22:12] <Whirl3d> sry
[15:22:14] <imsky> nobody has to know Whirl3d ;)
[15:22:15] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:22:22] <imsky> SKUNK WORKS
[15:22:54] <imsky> what's your jq extension for?
[15:23:01] <imsky> because i could think of one i need right now
[15:23:08] <Whirl3d> cardguy1000, perhaps you can select nothing to update the item.
[15:23:23] <Whirl3d> imsky, what's that?
[15:23:40] <imsky> making...grids
[15:23:51] <Whirl3d> I'm writing a scrolling plugin, but that involves a bounds plugin, a draggable plugin, etc.
[15:23:53] <imsky> it's a sexy project for sure
[15:23:56] <imsky> gets all the german ladies hot
[15:24:00] <fernandoaleman> I created a jquery function so when I click an html row and put it in edit mode by loading another page. Problem is, once I try to click on the textfields, it reloads the row since it's a "click". How do I fix this?
[15:24:02] <Whirl3d> grids?
[15:24:07] <imsky> yeah, for photoshop, ya know
[15:24:22] <imsky> fernandoaleman: event.target
[15:24:47] <Whirl3d> fernandoaleman, try using $('something').click(function (e) { e.preventDefault();.... might help
[15:24:49] <fernandoaleman> $("col").live("click", function(e) {
[15:24:54] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, when you say select nothing do you mean like $("#newModel select").val("");?
[15:25:09] <Whirl3d> cardguy1000, brb
[15:25:50] <fernandoaleman> Ok cool imsky and Whirl3d, I'll give those a try
[15:25:53] <fernandoaleman> Thanks
[15:25:56] <imsky> np bud
[15:26:39] <Whirl3d> cardguy1000, so, #newModelselect is a drop down menu?
[15:27:03] <black_warlock> uff unbelieveble =\
[15:27:44] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, well #newModel is a table that contains 1 row of 5 columns, each column has a drop down.  http://dev.mcbridehomes.com/mockup/test.asp
[15:27:46] <imsky> wot
[15:28:01] <Whirl3d> I think you mean focus, then.  I'll look brb
[15:28:49] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, nice yeah it looks like focus is what I needed.
[15:29:06] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, thanks
[15:29:16] <Whirl3d> np. Looks good so far, btw
[15:29:57] <Whirl3d> cardguy1000, put a border around the select elements so that when they are focused, they don't change size.
[15:29:59] <cardguy1000> thanks, I owe the props to the developer of toggleEdit
[15:30:59] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, awesome that was bothering me wasn't sure quite how to fix it. Appreciate the tip
[15:31:21] <Whirl3d> imsky, what kind of grids are we talking?
[15:31:33] <imsky> the beautiful kind :P
[15:31:35] <imsky> here
[15:31:49] <imsky> http://www.cameronmcefee.com/guideguide/
[15:31:51] <fernandoaleman> When I alert(event.target), I get [object HTMLDivElement]. How can I get just "HTMLDivElement"?
[15:31:51] <Whirl3d> where you are concerned, I have no doubt. LOL
[15:31:59] <imsky> guideguide is kind of what i want for photoshop
[15:32:14] <imsky> except without all the "install plugin here"
[15:32:20] <thun> Hi guys I have a button I call a function on it and it all works... the button also submits the form which I do not want... i added return false to the function and it works but the button class stays hovered
[15:32:24] <thun> anyway to fix that
[15:35:40] <abjorn> imsky: They do have that, actually :p http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/itdepartment/691f/
[15:36:14] <imsky> good thiking
[15:36:39] <imsky> photoshop just got dominated by one of its own textfields
[15:36:45] <imsky> good job, 20 year old program
[15:36:55] <imsky> you can still be rendered impotent by some lazy gui programming
[15:37:18] <abjorn> c:
[15:39:31] <Whirl3d> Photoshop has completely messed up lately. I wish they would quit adding features that should be extensible and just focus on getting the rest of it right.
[15:40:02] <imsky> you said it brother
[15:40:24] <imsky> down with photoshop, etc
[15:40:45] <Whirl3d> It's absolutely unacceptable that after 20 years of development , they can't recover from a crash without losing all of your work.
[15:40:49] <cardguy1000> Whirl3d, perhaps you know why this is happening.  When the page is first loaded none of the options are set via html with a "selected=selected" attribute.  The select however defaults to the first option.  When I remove the selected attribute and focus the control instead of defaulting to the 1st option it will show an empty selection.  Any idea if the select can be defaulted to the first option without me having to specify the value?
[15:41:10] <imsky> holy wall of text
[15:41:40] <Whirl3d> cardguy1000, brb
[15:42:28] <ajpiano> cardguy1000: you're saying... it defaults to the first optoin, but you want to set it to the first option.... ?
[15:43:43] <cardguy1000> ajpiano, it's a little tricky to explain... see http://dev.mcbridehomes.com/mockup/test.asp change the first combo box to condo click add, then notice how that drop down becomes blank
[15:43:44] <ajpiano> it's not clear what you're trying to do
[15:43:52] <ryanneufeld> cardguy1000: browsers will show that the first item is selected
[15:43:54] <ryanneufeld> however
[15:44:06] <ryanneufeld> if you don't have selected attribute on any option
[15:44:14] <ryanneufeld> getting selected from jquery will be empty
[15:44:35] <ryanneufeld> since it's not explicitly set, also submitting said form will mean that the value of your select won't get passed
[15:45:09] <ryanneufeld> you need to explicitly have <option selected value="somevalue">some option</option>
[15:45:10] <ajpiano> cardguy1000, if you know the value you want to set a <select> to
[15:45:15] <ajpiano> you don't have to screw around with the optoins
[15:45:30] <ajpiano> you can just do $("#select").val(valueOfOption);
[15:45:40] <cardguy1000> oooooook, gotcha
[15:45:51] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: what he's saying is that he's not setting any of them as selected when the html is rendered
[15:45:59] <ajpiano> oh
[15:46:07] <ajpiano> yeah attributes don't realy work like that well in cloning
[15:46:10] <ryanneufeld> so $("#select").val() will be empty
[15:46:30] <Whirl3d> is this a function of toggleEdit? It appears that "stickyFocus" is an option, does that help?
[15:46:38] <ajpiano> but one of them will be selected if there is no <option> ...
[15:46:43] <ajpiano> that has it...
[15:46:44] <breaks_m> hi all, I have a very little question: I have attached a function to handle window resize events, using $(window).resize = myFunction() .. but my function is only executed once, when loading my page, not afterwards when resizing the window...how comes this?
[15:46:51] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: nope
[15:46:56] <ryanneufeld> not in my experience
[15:47:16] <Whirl3d> try $(window).resize(function() {
[15:48:03] <Whirl3d> It's the same as $(window).bind("resize", function ()) whereas $(window).resize=something may try to redefine resize
[15:48:06] <cardguy1000> yeah, I was focused to much on selecting the option instead of setting the value.  Without the value I'm screwed when it comes to posting the results, so that is where I need to focus
[15:48:08] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/vEGcR/ ?
[15:48:08] <Whirl3d> rather than bind it.
[15:48:15] <cardguy1000> thanks
[15:48:41] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: interesting, maybe I'm flashing back to php
[15:48:43] <ryanneufeld> if you submit that
[15:48:59] <ryanneufeld> $_POST['foo'] won't be set
[15:49:37] <ajpiano> i'm not sure about that either
[15:49:37] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/vEGcR/1/
[15:49:41] <breaks_m> Whirl3d, myFunction is actually a function defined elsewhere...is that a problem? at least it gets executed once, I don't get this..
[15:49:55] <cardguy1000> I gtg, thanks for all your help guys
[15:50:05] <Whirl3d> $(window).resize(somefunctionname) will work
[15:50:21] <breaks_m> Whirl3d, well, not more than once ;) but why?
[15:50:23] <Whirl3d> so will $(window).bind("resize", somefunctionname)
[15:50:41] <Whirl3d> $(window).resize=function ()  should only fire once
[15:51:02] <snover> uh
[15:51:15] <snover> $(window).resize = anything will do nothing
[15:51:22] <snover> because you are setting a property on a jquery object
[15:51:23] <aghouseh> oyyy, bouncing slidetoggle menus.. anyone have any tips to resolve that?
[15:51:44] <Yakko> hey, I'm getting errors in many jquery versions in IE7, does it happen to anybody else?
[15:52:00] <Yakko> it's IE8 actually
[15:52:11] <breaks_m> am I now too stupid I don't get it
[15:52:26] <Whirl3d> break_m, what is the name of your function?
[15:53:46] <breaks_m> Whirl3d, "resizeLayout"
[15:54:02] <Whirl3d> breaks_m, try $(window).resize(resizeLayout) ;   letter for letter
[15:54:23] <Whirl3d> that is much different from $(window).resize=resizeLayout
[15:55:07] <breaks_m> Whirl3d, indeed, that works
[15:55:35] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure why it fires once even the other way, like snover said, but that should solve the problem
[15:55:37] <Yakko> hi guys, I'm getting jquery internal errors while running on IE, did it ever happen to anybody? is there a fix?
[15:55:56] <platzhirsch> Are there books around which are suggested to read when get starting with ajax or should I go with some public tutorials?
[15:56:14] <snover> Yakko: itâ€™s almost certainly your code, not jquery code. go up the stack trace.
[15:56:15] <breaks_m> Whirl3d, yes that works..an when I think about it now my attempt was just complete bullshit :)
[15:56:30] <Whirl3d> yakko, it's likely a problem with your code, not jquery--to be honest. It just looks like  it's a jquery error in the debugger
[15:56:58] <Whirl3d> lol, sorry, didn't see snover's post.
[15:57:53] <JustCSS> does .addClass() work when an element already has a class? seems not.
[15:57:54] <Whirl3d> platzhirsch, look on-line. There are tons of great resources. jQuery Ajax API instructions make it pretty easy for the most part
[15:58:48] <Whirl3d> JustCSS, do you mean does addClass(someClass) add someClass again? Or do you mean does addClass() fail if the element already has another class?
[15:58:52] <platzhirsch> Whirl3d: ok thanks, just thought there is something nice out there, I was looking for Ajax head first :)
[15:59:25] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: the second one
[15:59:56] <Whirl3d> $(".someclass").addClass("anotherClass") will add "anotherClass" to all items of class "someclass"
[16:00:05] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: no i mean in html my label has a class. now i want js to add another class to it, and it seems to not work.
[16:00:30] <Whirl3d> should work fine. can you make a jsfiddle about it?
[16:00:44] <Yakko> snover it happens on everything I build
[16:00:44] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: sure
[16:01:09] <Whirl3d> if you want to set the class to another class (replacing the first class), use $(item).attr('class', newclass);
[16:01:12] <Yakko> and it reports to be line 4737 and 2972 in jquery.js file
[16:01:47] <snover> Yakko: An error can occur inside jQuery code because you are passing invalid input to a jQuery function.
[16:01:54] <snover> the problem is still in your code.
[16:01:58] <snover> you need to read the stack trace.
[16:06:35] <Yakko> Message: Unexpected call to method or property access. Line: 4737 Char: 5 Code: 0 URI:  http://.........../jquery.js
[16:07:09] <Yakko> snover you had somebody asking this 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7481
[16:07:10] <snover> Yakko: if you are going to keep ignoring what i am saying you are never going to solve your problem
[16:07:52] <snover> Yakko: yes, as it turns out, lots of people donâ€™t know what they are doing and make mistakes when using jquery :)
[16:07:58] <snover> that does not make it a jquery bug.
[16:08:32] <Yakko> snover: did you ever meet a way out of this situation?
[16:08:33] <htoothrot> Yakko, did you read the comments there? same answer
[16:08:46] <snover> Yakko: I think I have already told you twice what you need to do
[16:09:05] <snover> If you are confused by what I said please say exactly which part confuses you
[16:09:17] <Whirl3d> sounds like maybe more than twice, just twice under the name "yakko", lol
[16:09:17] <snover> after doing a google search for some of the terms I mentioned
[16:10:14] <Yakko> snover the reason I took long and said it twice is because the error was displayied to me in my native language, so I had to translate it for you
[16:10:46] <Yakko> so I had to dig a lot to get the exact terms
[16:11:33] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: is the world disabled a reserved work in jquery becase .addClass('disabled') is not happening.
[16:11:38] <JustCSS> *word
[16:12:28] <Whirl3d> Not sure. But you can do $("something").attr('disabled', 'disabled') to disable it.
[16:12:28] <snover> Yakko: Iâ€™m not going to repeat myself any more. Do what I said and you will be able to fix your problem; donâ€™t do what I say and remain hopelessly broken forever. Your choice.
[16:12:41] <Yakko> JustCSS I think it's ui-disabled if you want jquery-ui
[16:13:48] <aghouseh> anyone run into a hover bounce bug solution? event.stopPropagation() doesn't seem to be thwarting it
[16:13:50] <aghouseh> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCFeImyBzfE
[16:14:36] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: sure, but im using a class to "disable" a label for styling.  i have used what you just said for inputs.
[16:14:54] <Whirl3d> are you using jqueryUI?
[16:15:05] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: no
[16:15:39] <Whirl3d> aghouseh, you may need to look at the fx queue documentation or perhaps call .stop(true, true) before the bounce animation
[16:15:54] <aghouseh> oh, im not calling the bounce animation
[16:16:11] <aghouseh> just using a slidetoggle.. but it gets caught in a loop
[16:16:14] <Whirl3d> JustCSS, have you tried using "anotherDisabled" to test it.
[16:16:15] <aghouseh> so its 'bouncing'
[16:16:52] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: yes that doesn't work either so for some reason its not liking the selector
[16:17:12] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: jQuery('li.creditCardRollout label').addClass('poo');
[16:17:32] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: jQuery('li.creditCardRollout input').attr... <-- worked
[16:17:39] <JustCSS> go figure
[16:17:56] <Whirl3d> perhaps it's in your CSS then. Maybe a conflict in the defs or something.
[16:19:55] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: but im not seeing the class added in the html when i check it with tools
[16:20:46] <Whirl3d> That's why I figure it's gotta be a css thing, not a jquery thing. It sounds like jquery is doing it's part, Just the CSS that's conflicting....maybe?
[16:22:04] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: how can CSS stop a HTML class from being added?
[16:22:16] <chrislabeard> if I'm using .animate() and want to slide something up and down using the height how can I set it to auto height? 100% doesn't work right
[16:22:35] <Yakko> snover thanks dude :)
[16:23:05] <Whirl3d> chrislabeard, have you tried .slideUp() and .slideDown()?
[16:23:13] <Whirl3d> rather than animate?
[16:23:22] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: yeah but I want to fade in on slide down and seems like animate is the best way to do them both
[16:23:33] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: whenever i would do .slideUp().fadein() it wouldn't work correctly
[16:23:43] <chrislabeard> or woops fadeout
[16:23:47] <chrislabeard> either one of those
[16:24:41] <Whirl3d> I never use fadeIn or fadeOut (mostly out of habit), but perhaps slideUp().animate({opacity:0})...would work. I'm not sure how to calculate height and I've asked before with no answer.
[16:25:05] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: i tried that, and it doesn't run the animate for some reason
[16:25:35] <ajpiano> chrislabeard 1 sec
[16:25:53] <Whirl3d> I've even stooped so low as to attach the contents to a child div of a div with opacity:0 to get the height, then reattach it to its original and use the calc value to animate. Ugly ugly ugly
[16:26:08] <chrislabeard> lol yeah
[16:26:13] <chrislabeard> sounds like it
[16:26:14] <skiz> chrislabeard:  look up jquery custom animation queues
[16:27:08] <ajpiano> chrislabeard http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/408
[16:27:23] <ajpiano> there are a number of different solutions that are proposed for doing it in core, one of them should certainly work in your sitation
[16:28:20] <Whirl3d> ajpiano to the rescue...again. Thanks.
[16:31:48] <JustCSS> Whirl3d: solved it - it was a css issue. i changed label { font-color: grey; } to { color: grey; } and it worked. Don't know why it didn't like font-color
[16:32:16] <ajpiano> because "color" is the name of the property, not "font-color"
[16:32:25] <Whirl3d> <--I hate css, for the record.
[16:33:14] <JustCSS> ajpiano: huh? property of what?
[16:33:20] <ajpiano> css
[16:33:22] <ajpiano> the name of the property
[16:33:27] <ajpiano> for the color of the text in an element
[16:33:27] <ajpiano> is color
[16:33:30] <ajpiano> not font-color
[16:33:34] <ajpiano> that is why it didn't like font color
[16:36:42] <daniellopezific> anybody familiar with jquery internals?
[16:36:55] <daniellopezific> trying to understand this: var example = jQuery('<div style="left:'+left+';"></div>');
[16:37:33] <daniellopezific> does it create a document fragment?
[16:37:51] <daniellopezific> if so, what would be more expensiveâ€¦ putting an inline style
[16:38:04] <daniellopezific> or applying the style after the document fragment is created
[16:38:26] <daniellopezific> using example[0].style.left or jQuery(example).css( â€¦ etc
[16:38:36] <daniellopezific> any idea?
[16:38:56] <JustCSS> i'ld say inline style
[16:39:02] <daniellopezific> would be faster?
[16:39:19] <JustCSS> thats my guess
[16:39:37] <daniellopezific> was mine too, just scares me that jQuery would be trying to parse the styles
[16:39:41] <ajpiano> i'm not so sure... when you pass a single simple tag, it is able to do a document.createElement
[16:39:42] <daniellopezific> or maybe its native
[16:39:45] <ajpiano> instead of bothering with the document fragment at all
[16:39:54] <ajpiano> but adding the inline style will probably make it blow past that regex and use a doc frag
[16:39:59] <daniellopezific> *or maybe its a native way of creating the fragment
[16:40:27] <daniellopezific> i'll search around the source, its been bothering me that i don't know for sure
[16:40:51] <ajpiano> daniellopezific https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L125
[16:41:18] <daniellopezific> ah nice
[16:41:22] <daniellopezific> thanks ajpiano
[16:44:00] <daniellopezific> yea looks fine, i'll stick with the inline styles still. seems like it would be faster looking at the code
[16:44:42] <daniellopezific> not doing anything too fancy, and is just using a native createElement, which in theory should be relatively fast...
[16:45:42] <ajpiano> we can find out very easily
[16:47:14] <daniellopezific> jsperf it
[16:47:41] <daniellopezific> you already putting one together? otherwise i'll do it
[16:47:42] <ajpiano> that's what i'm doing
[16:47:42] <ajpiano> :p
[16:47:47] <daniellopezific> ah cool :D
[16:50:48] <ajpiano> so yeah its kind of a push
[16:50:49] <ajpiano> http://jsperf.com/inline-style-vs-css-afterwards
[16:50:58] <ajpiano> .css() is faster in chrome, inline style is faster in ff
[16:51:21] <Whirl3d> what are the jquery css property names for padding? paddingTop?paddingBottom?
[16:51:29] <daniellopezific> about even?
[16:51:47] <systemfault> Whirl3d: jQuery uses the CSS naming AFAIK
[16:52:10] <systemfault> Whirl3d: So.. try 'padding-bottom'
[16:52:10] <ajpiano> daniellopezific: run the tests :p
[16:52:23] <Whirl3d> Right, with camelCase instead of -, I thought
[16:52:31] <daniellopezific> running
[16:52:47] <daniellopezific> yea i am suprised
[16:52:52] <daniellopezific> through it would be ALOT more significant
[16:52:53] <Whirl3d> must be doing something else wrong. thx for the reply, systemfault
[16:52:57] <daniellopezific> well i guess 25% is in firefox
[16:53:23] <ajpiano> but firefox's "slow" handling of the css is faster than chromes where css is faster
[16:53:26] <ajpiano> all in all
[16:53:31] <ajpiano> it's a microoptimisation
[16:53:39] <ajpiano> and i would try to avoid stringbuilding that inline style cause it's mad ug
[16:54:00] <aghouseh> all that saved browser time doesn't add up to the time it takes to code it :)
[16:54:06] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:57:51] <z1000> hey ajpiano
[16:57:58] <ajpiano> sup
[16:57:59] <z1000> how you doing man? still holding it down like usual.
[16:58:08] <ajpiano> harder than usual
[16:58:40] <z1000> so I built this little demo of what I want to do
[16:58:47] <z1000> curious your initial thoughts on best approach to do it, if you have a second
[16:58:55] <ajpiano> ...ok
[16:59:08] <c_t_montgomery> Is there a better method, besides .change() that I can call on an <option> dropdown? I'm looking for when a user makes any selection in the drop box, not necessarily one that's different than the default.
[16:59:45] <ajpiano> that's what change is for, c_t_montgomery
[16:59:50] <Whirl3d> does the line $(item).css("padding-bottom") return a string or a number? and if it's a string (which it appears to be, why?)
[16:59:56] <z1000> c_t_montgomery, I do not have a direct answer but I do have some good links that may help u
[17:00:02] <z1000> http://gerrendesign.com/weblog/2009/06/how_to_make_custom_select_boxe.php
[17:00:27] <z1000> I also used this recently and it worked great... http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ui_selectmenu_an_aria_accessible_plugin_for_styling_a_html_select/
[17:00:55] <c_t_montgomery> @ajpiano .change() only fires when an element other than the current one has been selected. If a user happens to open the dropdown, then realize they want to select the current element, nothing gets fired.
[17:01:34] <ajpiano> c_t_montgomery, hum, i think you're SOL on that
[17:01:39] <ajpiano> unless you start tracking mouse and keyboard events
[17:01:51] <c_t_montgomery> i could just use raw js, i was just wondering if jquery had a method i was unaware of
[17:02:13] <c_t_montgomery> thanks for your help though!
[17:10:47] <z1000> hi gnarf
[17:10:58] <ch3mical> Does anyone know how to make autocomplete list pop up when the input is focused?
[17:13:34] <Whirl3d> ch3mical! how goes it?
[17:13:46] <ch3mical> Good, how about you?
[17:14:10] <Whirl3d> exceptional, thanx. Sorry I don't know about autocomplete at all or I'd help (or try to help).
[17:14:19] <ch3mical> haha thanks
[17:14:20] <ch3mical> :)
[17:16:24] <Whirl3d> some lovin' (murk deep and dark remix) is one of the greatest songs of all time...imho
[17:16:52] <ch3mical> Link
[17:17:23] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: did you finish that project you were working on?
[17:23:26] <Whirl3d> sry, oh hell no. I'm never gonna finnish it. lol. something came up and had to put it aside (like always).
[17:24:23] <glaksmono> is there a way to get the height of a div, without height or CSS attribute?
[17:24:25] <Whirl3d> http://open.spotify.com/track/3IVNFpdHeHeY8QZZSZAfAG - (not the dark and dirty mix, but still a good murk mix)
[17:25:17] <thinkster> Hi, I am using a shopping cart on my site, and basicaly, everypage has a shopping cart total/items info, as well as table showing details, but I hide the table on most pages except the the "view cart" page.  Thing is, when the page loads, you see the cart, when it loads, and then it disappears.  I wish to never see it at all.  so maybe for those pages, instead of jquery hide, I must put in css code to hide it.  So probably it would be bett
[17:25:18] <thinkster> er that, instead of hide is change the css style to display none, would that fix the issue?
[17:26:34] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: sucks.. happens to me all the time too.. also, I don't have spotify
[17:27:23] <ch3mical> thinkster: hide it in css not jquery, use jquery just to show it
[17:27:32] <kborchers> thinkster: seems to make sense that if you want it hidden more often than shown, you would hide it with css by default then use show() when needed
[17:27:50] <Whirl3d> spotify just came to the US. I got it within about 15 minutes of it becoming available and haven't turned it off since.
[17:28:04] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: haven't been interested in trying it
[17:28:21] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: seems like an almost antiquated way of listening to music
[17:28:22] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, why not?
[17:28:32] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: by the way, add me on g+ :P
[17:28:40] <ajpiano> how is spotify antiquated
[17:28:48] <Whirl3d> for real? I am old as dirt, btw
[17:28:53] <thinkster> kborchers, yeah you are right, but at this point, to fix it, cause I have it on like 50 pages, can I just change the $('#somediv').hide(); to $('#somediv').attribute('display', none); or whatever the jquery code for changing css is
[17:29:18] <thinkster> ch3mical, yeah, but I have like 50 files, so I wanted to just change the hide() command to the css command
[17:29:20] <ch3mical> ajpiano: It's a desktop application that doesn't even use the cloud to sync across desktops, for one
[17:29:21] <kborchers> thinkster: but you'll still see it before it's hidden like with hide
[17:29:43] <ch3mical> thinkster: display:none ... ;)
[17:29:48] <thinkster> kborchers, oh bummer, then I will have to edit lots of pages, actually just a few stylesheets,
[17:29:50] <Whirl3d> sure it does. It syncs between all of my devices.
[17:30:08] <ajpiano> i like the fact that it is desktop
[17:30:10] <thinkster> ch3mical, yeah, I just realized, its not big deal, just two three stylesheets, I will set to display none, thx
[17:30:12] <thinkster> kborchers, thx
[17:30:32] <ajpiano> and i also think most people don't really have a situation of wanting to sync the same lib to multiple computers, especially if they don't have most of their media
[17:30:38] <ajpiano> and as someone who *has* a lot of media
[17:30:42] <Whirl3d> I still love pandora, though
[17:30:51] <ajpiano> i can definitely say i don't need hundreds of gbs of mp3s in more than one place
[17:31:01] <ch3mical> ajpiano: exactly
[17:31:01] <Whirl3d> testify!
[17:31:03] <ajpiano> uch i am so not into pandora
[17:31:26] <Whirl3d> I love it. I can't wait for them to open their algorhythm for use in other apps.
[17:31:36] <kborchers> my 2 cents, grooveshark is pretty nice
[17:31:41] <Whirl3d> what don't you like about pandora ?
[17:31:46] <ch3mical> kborchers: ^5
[17:32:06] <Whirl3d> grooveshark? (looking it up now).  Spotify>google music at least
[17:32:07] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: it just plays a bunch of tracks you liked a long time ago
[17:32:27] <ajpiano> Whirl3d, i don't really like radioing, i like to put on a record and listen to it, and then repeat.
[17:32:33] <ajpiano> so pandora is pretty much the opposite of that
[17:32:47] <ajpiano> repeat with a different one*
[17:32:53] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I would rather just upload all my shtuff to google music or something.. I always have several browsers open at a time anyway, what benefit does a desktop app give me? None, considering most of the time I'm not even on windows
[17:33:12] <Whirl3d> Yeah, somethimes I just get overwhelmed with what to listen to. I have a collection of 3000+ dance music cds from 1990 on and it gets tiring trying to decide
[17:33:22] <ajpiano> ch3mical: that's just a matter of preference
[17:33:34] <ajpiano> i abhor the idea of having to go into my web browser and then pick a tab etc
[17:33:42] <ajpiano> to pause my music or put on new tracks
[17:33:43] <glaksmono> is there a way to get the height of a div, without height or CSS attribute?
[17:33:55] <ch3mical> ajpiano: but the fact that it doesn't sync your prefs and data across devices is a huge fail in my book
[17:34:10] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, but it does.
[17:34:31] <ajpiano> i haven't really screwed with syncing yet
[17:34:42] <ajpiano> i just know that i have been suffering along with piece of shit itunes
[17:34:48] <ajpiano> and spotify is way better than that :p
[17:34:50] <kborchers> glaksmono: you mean without a height set or without using see ?height
[17:34:54] <Whirl3d> what is going to be weird, though is the matching system from Apple.
[17:35:05] <kborchers> c'mon bot-t
[17:35:20] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/height/
[17:35:30] <ch3mical> ajpiano: that's what extensions are for, gives you your music controls no matter what tab you're on
[17:35:56] <ajpiano> meh
[17:36:07] <ajpiano> i have always just preferred music to be a desktop app
[17:36:29] <ch3mical> That's fine, I have no problem with people liking that style
[17:36:31] <Whirl3d> if someone wants to get rich, what the world needs is a server that lets people drop music in to a queue from their phone.
[17:36:35] <ch3mical> Just to me it seems a bit antiquated
[17:36:55] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: that's a brilliant idea
[17:36:58] <Whirl3d> so often, my friends are like: "oh, wait have you seen this...." or "check this out" a queuing system would solve that
[17:37:01] <ajpiano> perhaps the service can be some sort of "Drop Box"
[17:37:08] <Whirl3d> right.
[17:37:11] <ajpiano> matter of fact, what about naming it Dropbox
[17:37:15] <ajpiano> .....oh wait...
[17:37:17] <ajpiano> :p
[17:37:18] <coldhead> gramophones, dependable, reliable, hand-cranked gramophones
[17:37:26] <Whirl3d> except you'd need to have it playable
[17:37:33] <ch3mical> coldhead: now that's state of the art
[17:37:34] <ajpiano> coldhead: please stop advertising your brothel in here
[17:38:14] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: I bet that would be easy to do with grooveshark API
[17:38:27] <Whirl3d> checking out grooveshark now. thx
[17:38:27] <ch3mical> Not sure if grooveshark has one, but I'm betting they do
[17:38:40] <ch3mical> That would be pretty sick, too
[17:38:54] <ch3mical> Crowd sourced playlist heh
[17:39:13] <ch3mical> Or probably friend-sourced would be best
[17:39:19] <ajpiano> spotify is pretty bomb for crowdsourced playlists like that
[17:39:21] <kborchers> i think grooveshark is working on an api but not sure
[17:39:44] <ajpiano> like, having a playlist that you and a group of friends contribute to
[17:39:47] <ajpiano> boom
[17:40:09] <ch3mical> ajpiano: from your phone?
[17:40:17] <ajpiano> oh
[17:40:19] <ajpiano> from my phone
[17:40:19] <ch3mical> And on the fly?
[17:40:30] <ajpiano> fuck that, i can't even use gmaps on this busted ass piece of shit
[17:40:35] <ch3mical> haha
[17:40:46] <ch3mical> Feature phone?
[17:40:50] <ajpiano> i literally had to give up using google maps in like  march or april
[17:40:53] <ajpiano> iphone 3g
[17:40:56] <ajpiano> :/
[17:41:09] <ch3mical> lol
[17:41:21] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, you should be rich with all your knowledge...you got kids? drug addicted? what's up with the iphone 3?
[17:41:23] <ch3mical> I have a 3GS from work.. hate it
[17:41:30] <ch3mical> My personal phone is a G2
[17:42:08] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: haha, i got warranty replaced last year and then was brand new when the 4 came out, and now i don't want to get a 4 late in the game so i'm holding out for the 5 or at least 4s
[17:42:59] <ch3mical> So.. any idea how to force an autocomplete (jqui) list to open when the associated input is focused?
[17:43:00] <Whirl3d> 5 should be out soon. I can't wait. THough I am no Apple fanboy, it's supposed to be pretty amazing. And they have ordered more than 100 million according to some reports...maybe they'll be cheaper
[17:43:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:43:23] <Whirl3d> sorry to get us sidetracked y'all. Thanks for the discussion, though.
[17:43:55] <ajpiano> ch3mical, i'm pretty sure it's possible, give me a minute
[17:44:01] <ch3mical> Nothing wrong with a good distraction
[17:44:28] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I've tried binding the focus event and using .show() on the autocomplete list eleemtn
[17:44:31] <ch3mical> element*
[17:44:38] <ch3mical> No such luck
[17:45:13] <ch3mical> Also tried binding it with live just in case
[17:45:35] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, what about trigger?
[17:45:39] <ch3mical> I wish autocomplete had an option like .autocomplete('open') or something
[17:46:24] <Jason_> Checking Here to see if the following is indeed a bug: In draggable, the stack option toggles the z-index of the draggable elements. It starts at z-index of 0, which is a bad idea imho. The element is no longer draggable before of this value.
[17:46:40] <ch3mical> I'm guessing I could extend the widget properties to include such a function, but that sounds like a lot of work
[17:47:19] <ajpiano> ch3mical, it's simple
[17:47:24] <ajpiano> there's a search method
[17:47:37] <ajpiano> i'll make you a demo 1 sec
[17:47:38] <ch3mical> Yeah..
[17:47:53] <ch3mical> I assumed to use that I would have to search FOR something
[17:48:06] <ch3mical> I want the whole list shown, though
[17:48:20] <ch3mical> But if that's possible, that's great
[17:48:36] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/YLdNQ/
[17:49:11] <ajpiano> ch3mical, presumably, that would just be a matter of making your search through the data allow things to pass through if an empty string is the search term
[17:49:26] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's good, but the point of having it open the list on focus is that I want it to double as a "dropdown" style menu, so if the field is empty search doesn't work
[17:49:45] <ajpiano> that is what i'm saying is not necessarly true
[17:49:48] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[17:49:49] <ch3mical> Maybe that will work if I put minLength: 0
[17:49:54] <ch3mical> Hmm
[17:50:11] <ch3mical> Yep!
[17:50:15] <ch3mical> That does it
[17:50:23] <ch3mical> Perfect
[17:50:23] <ajpiano> wooo sweet!
[17:50:26] <ch3mical> Thanks ajpiano
[17:50:32] <ajpiano> no problemo
[17:52:48] <ch3mical> Woot, working like a charm
[17:52:48] <Jason_> @ ajpiano - what if i need a similar script that filtered a list of spans?
[17:52:59] <ajpiano> wat
[17:53:01] <Jason_> (not a drop down form)
[17:53:25] <ajpiano> i think that's what i implement in my like, jquery ui widget tutorial
[17:54:05] <ajpiano> Jason_: like this (click Toggle Filterable) http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide17
[17:57:16] <Jason_> I'll have to sort through that...thanks though!
[17:59:01] <Whirl3d> trying to do a custom scrollbar system and don't quite understand why my drag function isn't working: any suggestions: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/KVSqP/4/
[18:04:25] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: that doesn't seem to display properly for me
[18:04:38] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: tip: combine your var declarations into one
[18:04:58] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I split it all out for easy reading.
[18:05:17] <ch3mical> You can still put them on separate lines
[18:05:39] <Whirl3d> hmm. will do. Does it make a big difference?
[18:05:41] <ch3mical> Just do var whatever = whatever,(newline)whatever2 = whatever2,(newline)....
[18:05:44] <ch3mical> Yes it does
[18:05:53] <jjb1231> Hey guys I need some help with an IE jquery bug I'm having that I can't seem to fix. Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/H5E68fA7 Here's what is looks like in firefox (correct): http://i.imgur.com/xE7BW.png and IE (broken): http://i.imgur.com/2LGd8.png I have no idea how to fix this and any help at all would be appreciated!
[18:05:55] <Whirl3d> wow. Good to know.
[18:06:31] <jjb1231> Whoops, fixed pastebin link: http://pastebin.com/DT1vNHJj
[18:11:19] <dwarder> there is a plugin called centerscreen
[18:11:23] <dwarder> anyone heard?
[18:11:46] <coldhead> someone just mentioned it
[18:11:49] <coldhead> oh wait, that was you
[18:11:52] <coldhead> sorry
[18:11:56] <dwarder> the problem with this plugin is that if you scroll down your browser screen you wont get your centerscreen
[18:12:23] <dwarder> is it possible to actually _center_ it
[18:13:08] <ch3mical> Sounds like a crappy plugin
[18:13:14] <ch3mical> Going home, later guys
[18:14:14] <Whirl3d> gnite. good talking with ya.
[18:14:31] <coldhead> dwarder: unless we're talking about different things, you can generally center with position fixed and margins based on the size of the window
[18:14:45] <coldhead> with resize handlers so you can change them if the user messes things up
[18:15:04] <coldhead> stupid users
[18:17:31] <dwarder> coldhead: i want to have center that is dependant on where user has scrolled current page
[18:18:21] <coldhead> position: fixed is relative to the screen, not the page
[18:18:28] <coldhead> so they can scroll and scroll all they like
[18:18:33] <coldhead> THERE'S NO ESCAPE
[18:19:55] <dwarder> coldhead: thanks
[18:36:09] <gaius65> My understanding of the queue was that the next queued function ONLY starts after a dequeue()!?
[18:36:15] <gaius65> but that seems to not be true
[18:38:26] <gaius65> http://pastie.org/private/shqtnrfovu7xtwtwqsluq
[18:41:31] <lastk> hey guys, how can I know if I have other div.class after this div? I need to know if this box is the last or no
[18:42:13] <ajpiano> .nextAll("div.class").length
[18:49:40] <lastk> ajpiano : thank you, work fine ;)
[18:56:12] <mattalexx> I need to style a select element and it needs to look the same in all browsers. So I was thinking that I'd write some javascript that would convert the select to a UL element so it'd be easier to style. Then I thought that this may be a common request
[18:56:27] <mattalexx> So I'm here to ask you guys if you know any good plugins that will handle this
[19:10:06] <Assimilater> is anyone here familiar with ckeditor?
[19:21:41] <nohorse> a listview in a scrollview. the listviews click event fires when I mouseup from scrolling. and way to not perform the click when i'm really swiping with the mouse?
[19:28:50] <gaius65> Can anyone explain me this queing behaviour? http://pastie.org/private/shqtnrfovu7xtwtwqsluq
[19:31:33] <dreamr> Can anyone tell me why my javascript object method returns the signiture instead of the value? ;)
[19:31:40] <dreamr> https://gist.github.com/1096386
[19:37:18] <Paganini> gaius65 I'm pretty new to all this, but looking at the order of your code, what was returned seemed to be correct other than 'started 2' at the bottom but I presume that should have been 'started 3'? I'm not too sure why you expected a different order
[19:38:18] <gaius65> Paganini: I expected what when I add 2 functions to the queue the second is only called AFTER one dequeue()
[19:38:33] <gaius65>  I expected that when...
[19:38:53] <gaius65> This is more precise: http://pastie.org/2246296
[19:41:00] <gaius65> dreamr: what exactly do you mean? You define in your SolarArray "class" that this.panels should be a function, so the console.debug(mounting_area.solar_array.panels); returns a function...
[19:41:08] <Paganini> gaius65: if you're looking to dequeue before the start of the second function, then I expect you will need to put the dequeue within the function after that queue has been started
[19:42:27] <Paganini>  such as, $("div").queue(function () {$(this).dequeue();}); -- at least looking at the jquery queue help file this seems to be their example
[19:45:13] <gaius65> jquery docs claim: Queues allow a sequence of actions to be called on an element asynchronously, without halting program execution.
[19:45:42] <gaius65> so I expected that the second function be ONLY be executed after a dequeue()
[19:45:55] <Paganini> gaius65: that's exactly what it's returning though
[19:46:09] <Paganini> gaius65: it's not halting the second queue start
[19:47:10] <gaius65> Paganini: I don't get it, so how can I achieve "started1 dequeued started2"?
[19:48:09] <gaius65> I though dequeue mean "Ok, the current function is now finish, so start next one in the queue"
[19:49:00] <Paganini> gaius65: You can have multiple queued within one function, http://api.jquery.com/queue/ look at the example at the bottom of the page, that might be what you're looking for?
[19:54:23] <gaius65> shit, actually I totally understood how queue works... I simple forgot that dequeue() will directly call the next function.. so my example should have looked like this
[19:54:33] <gaius65> ... console.info('dequeued');queue.dequeue();
[19:54:42] <gaius65> then it works as I expected
[19:58:50] <Paganini> awesome :)
[20:15:29] <gaius65> good night guys!
[20:15:42] <K1ng> how did facebook managed to get cross domain ajax working?
[20:16:00] <mixmasterxp> Is there a way I can select an element by id that is somewhere nested in another Id?
[20:16:29] <mixmasterxp> I tried: $('#parent > #somedeeplynestedchild')
[20:16:39] <seancurtis> CSS question: anyone know if you can restore the blue focus ring to form elements in FF after changing their border/background?
[20:16:43] <gaius65> K1ng: search for "script tag proxy"
[20:17:00] <seancurtis> mixmasterxp: remove the >
[20:17:01] <gaius65> e.g. here: http://jaybyjayfresh.com/2007/09/17/using-script-tags-to-do-remote-http-calls-in-javascript/
[20:17:14] <seancurtis> mixmasterxp: using > means the second thing is a direct child of the first
[20:17:40] <mixmasterxp> seancurtis: but without that, It still doesn't find it
[20:18:10] <seancurtis> are your IDs unique?
[20:18:29] <mixmasterxp> yes
[20:18:36] <seancurtis> then I don't know :(
[20:18:43] <seancurtis> it should work fine
[20:18:43] <mwhudson> what is wrong with just searching for the id?
[20:18:52] <mixmasterxp> Thats why I was trying to net them
[20:18:53] <seancurtis> yeah if they're IDs then you shouldn't need to scope at all
[20:19:02] <mixmasterxp> nest*
[20:19:04] <seancurtis> if there is only one on the page
[20:19:11] <seancurtis> then you don't need to find one within another id
[20:19:22] <mixmasterxp> My javascript is in another file, so I may have the same Id on another page
[20:19:50] <Assimilater> anyone here familiar with cleditor?
[20:19:50] <mixmasterxp> So I basically using the parent Id as something like a namespace
[20:20:39] <seancurtis> well what I'd try doing first
[20:21:01] <seancurtis> is doing console.log($('#parent').length);
[20:21:16] <seancurtis> then console.log($('#child').length)
[20:21:21] <seancurtis> you might have dupes
[20:21:32] <seancurtis> verify your markup is valid
[20:21:38] <seancurtis> could stuff up traversing
[20:21:49] <mixmasterxp> ok
[20:22:25] <mixmasterxp> another question, what is the event for when a textbox has a textchange event without blur?
[20:23:01] <Paganini> do you mean keypress?
[20:23:16] <seancurtis> keydown/keyup/keydown
[20:23:28] <seancurtis> keydown/keyup/keypress
[20:23:35] <Paganini> what he said :)
[20:23:39] <mixmasterxp> if they pasted something?
[20:23:41] <seancurtis> or onchange?
[20:23:56] <seancurtis> hard to catch all of those cases mixmasterxp
[20:23:59] <mixmasterxp> onchange seems to use work after blur
[20:24:02] <seancurtis> there are heaps of ways to copy/paste
[20:24:03] <mixmasterxp> ok
[20:24:05] <solidus-river> restfull ajax api done and tested :) later all
[20:24:11] <seancurtis> ie dragging text into the field
[20:28:44] <zangetsu> hello
[20:30:23] <sdwrage> Hey all. Anyone familiar with Columnizer?
[20:31:14] <zangetsu> i have a tabs navigation (from jquerui) with ajax variant, how i can disable tab content update if i click on an link ?
[20:36:50] <bjhaid> I am trying to use a jquery-ui to respond to an ajax request, but the ui doesnt respond, i really do not know where to look at for the error, firebug shows that the request is sent, but I do not get a dialog pop-up as expected my codes are at: https://gist.github.com/1096440 thanks
[20:44:35] <benjaminRRR> has anyone else had focus() problems with safari on the iPhone? It does not seem to take; any workarounds?
[20:53:27] <Assimilater> can anyone help me figure out why this is spitting out an error? I'm trying to use cleditor: http://pastie.org/2246539
[20:54:35] <sdwrage> Anyone here ever use the columnizer plugin?
[20:55:51] <sdwrage> I am having an issue where the paragraph tags are getting carried over entirely instead of it cutting them and carrying the leftovers over
[20:56:06] <radiantstatic> Hey all, I'm attempting to correct some issues I am having with my squares here. I'd like for the drop down to close before the horizontal slide closes and vis-versa. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I could do? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/4MWRp/13/ - Right now I'm using moo tools, but would this be easier in jqueryUI or something?
[21:01:55] <bjhaid1> hi, please I am trying to use a jquery plugin, but how do i ensure it responds to a conditional statement like if 2== 2 rather than respond to a click event
[21:02:54] <jorvis> Does anyone here use the query tooltip plugin?  I'm getting errors when I include the jquery.dimensions.js file from the demo and the popups are just squares with black backgrounds.
[21:04:55] <radiantstatic> Anyone?
[21:07:47] <Paganini> radiantstatic I'm hardly a jquery guru, but after the squares been clicked you could toggle the menu and queue() the slide toggle?
[21:08:35] <Paganini> radiantstatic the queue should go off AFTER the menu animation I think
[21:08:58] <Paganini> btw, sick squares :)
[21:09:00] <radiantstatic> Paganini: I'm not much of a query guy either, but I take it queue is similar to fx chaining in mootools?
[21:09:01] <radiantstatic> ?
[21:09:08] <Paganini> yeah hang about
[21:09:12] <Paganini> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[21:09:37] <Paganini> it has working examples, but if you look at the click function, the show and animation goes off BEFORE queue (change colour) is initiated
[21:09:56] <radiantstatic> Paganini: Thanks, I will take a look and thanks, those squares are my heart and soul at the moment haha. I've been stuck on the same problem for the past 3 months. Just learning jquery/mootools through trial and error.
[21:10:34] <Paganini> tell me about it man, I've been racking my head for the past couple of days just trying to get to grips with jquery, most I've implimented are tooltips :D good times.
[21:10:54] <radiantstatic> Paganini: :-)
[21:11:19] <seancurtis> radiantstatic: read up on the queuing or play around with some of the animation callbacks
[21:12:17] <radiantstatic> seancurtis: Will do. Thanks, I figure it is capable of  accomplishing what I am looking to do. Question isâ€¦will "I" accomplish what I am looking to do.
[21:13:00] <seancurtis> $(dropdown).slideup('slow',function(){ $(menu).fadeOut(); });
[21:13:11] <seancurtis> something like that would work
[21:13:31] <seancurtis> but learning queuing and extracting stuff out to named animations would work better
[21:13:56] <radiantstatic> seancurtis: Thanks a ton, I will try it out.
[21:14:05] <seancurtis> so no one knows how to restore the focus glow on input[type=text] fields after changing the border/background?
[21:15:11] <Assimilater> anyone know how to retrieve the html value of a cleditor?
[21:16:54] <Paganini> seancurtis how to restore it? are you toggling a css class or using :focus on your dom at all?
[21:18:50] <seancurtis> Paganini: no - if you have a textfield/textarea and you change either the border or the background colour via CSS you lose the blue glow on focus
[21:18:54] <seancurtis> only in FF
[21:19:02] <seancurtis> wondering if there's some funky way to restore that
[21:20:08] <Paganini> seancurtis how are you creating the blue glow in the first place?
[21:20:21] <seancurtis> it's part of the browser/os
[21:20:24] <seancurtis> default
[21:20:32] <seancurtis> do you have FF on OSX there?
[21:20:48] <Paganini> nah sorry :/ I don't get a blue glow by default
[21:21:10] <seancurtis> what about on Chrome?
[21:21:18] <hariom> How to wait for few seconds before closing a dialog box? I have a button on the dialog box, on click of that, it does an ajax call. I need to show the result of that for few seconds and then close the dialog. How to wait before closing?
[21:21:33] <Paganini> no, chromes my main browser too
[21:21:47] <seancurtis> hariom: put the close function in the callback of the ajax call
[21:21:51] <styol> hariom: delay(3000)
[21:21:57] <ajpiano> hariom: in the callback of the ajax call, setTimeout(function() { $("#yourDialog").dialog("close"); }, 5000);
[21:22:27] <hariom> I tried $mydialog.delay(4000).dialog('close'); but it doesn't work
[21:22:33] <hariom> Trying out setTimeout
[21:25:02] <Assimilater> ajpiano: for always watching you must have been giving me the cold shoulder lately :P
[21:25:29] <ajpiano> ??
[21:25:39] <ajpiano> always watching was a bit of hyperbole
[21:25:44] <ajpiano> i am often watching
[21:25:46] <Assimilater> :P
[21:25:55] <ajpiano> sometimes i have to ya know, work
[21:26:04] <Assimilater> ya that's why i asked your irc hours :P
[21:26:06] <Demia> ajpiano: nah dont be ridiculous!
[21:26:09] <Assimilater> (i'm also joking)
[21:26:10] <ajpiano> heh
[21:26:14] <ajpiano> hehe :)
[21:26:33] <Assimilater> well you happen to be familiar with cleditor?
[21:27:50] <ajpiano> i've used it
[21:28:34] <Assimilater> You think you can help me figure out how to retireve the html content so i can send it through $.post()? This is what i tried: http://pastie.org/2246539
[21:28:56] <hariom> ajpiano: setTimeout works great.
[21:28:58] <Assimilater> for some reason even though $(this) returns what *i swear* is a cleditor object it doesn't recognize the method
[21:29:00] <hariom> thank you all
[21:29:37] <ajpiano> Assimilater: CKEditor has an API
[21:30:15] <Assimilater> ajpiano: are we talking different things? I looked at CKEditor but couldn't get it to create an object after an ajax call?
[21:30:25] <Assimilater> the textarea's in question i'm looking at appear after an ajax call
[21:30:46] <Assimilater> and i couldn't find half as much documentation on CKEditor as CLEditor
[21:31:01] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/jQuery_Adapter
[21:31:14] <Assimilater> jquery adapter?
[21:31:17] <Assimilater> :S
[21:31:27] <Assimilater> where have you been, ajpiano? lol
[21:31:27] <ajpiano> Code Interaction with Editor Instances
[21:31:27] <ajpiano> etc
[21:31:51] <ajpiano> i was just making ill advised quarterbacking decisions in madden
[21:32:02] <Assimilater> lol
[21:32:03] <ajpiano> now i am back to burn the midnight oil
[21:32:45] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/
[21:33:46] <Assimilater> i was gonna say it's uncharacteristic for open source stuff to be undocumented...but for some reason i couldn't find it
[21:33:58] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide etc
[21:34:04] <Assimilater> i swear it's a game with a lot of these plugins: can you find our download link? can you find our documentation? lol
[21:34:11] <ajpiano> heh
[21:37:13] <Assimilater> ajpiano: so if i understand this right, the content area is a textarea which has the class added 'editor'
[21:38:38] <ajpiano> iirc what ckeditor does it replace the original textarea with a CKeditor instance
[21:39:13] <ajpiano> but apparently it makes it so .val() works fine
[21:39:36] <Assimilater> on the origional textarea?
[21:39:44] <ajpiano> yup
[21:40:22] <Assimilater> maybe i can use this after all :)
[21:41:34] <ajpiano> many have :)
[21:41:51] <Paganini> no wonder ajpiano's been keeping quiet ;)
[21:42:02] <Assimilater> ya for the longest time i couldn't get this to work
[21:42:02] <ajpiano> lol
[21:42:06] <Assimilater> then i gave up and started searching
[21:42:10] <Assimilater> and lol @ Paganini
[21:42:39] <Paganini> I can't talk I'm sure I'll be bugging him over the next few days :)
[21:42:50] <Paganini> or her...
[21:42:52] <ajpiano> lol have we even met :p
[21:43:08] <Paganini> nope, but it seems as though you're first point of contact :D
[21:43:11] <ajpiano> ...guess not
[21:43:12] <ajpiano> :p
[21:47:57] <seancurtis> ajpiano: know how to reset focus glow for text inputs/textareas in FF on OSX?
[21:48:26] <ajpiano> uh, not off hand :p
[21:48:34] <seancurtis> damn k
[21:48:36] <ajpiano> where did it go that it has to be reset?
[21:48:37] <ajpiano> :p
[21:48:58] <Assimilater> ajpiano: so can i remove buttons one at a time?
[21:49:00] <seancurtis> changing the border or background colour on them removes the default blue glow in FF
[21:49:13] <ajpiano> Assimilater: which buttons?
[21:49:32] <seancurtis> wondering if there was any weird :moz-appearance style wizardry I could do to get it back
[21:49:43] <Assimilater> well i'm looking at email composition
[21:49:54] <Assimilater> so a lot of the form elements aren't needed
[21:49:57] <Assimilater> hidden inputs
[21:50:05] <Assimilater> etc
[21:50:17] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you're assuming i have way more context than i do
[21:50:25] <ajpiano> you can customise the buttons on CKEditor yes
[21:50:49] <Assimilater> sorry, I'm not sure exactly, i haven't completely familiarized myself with the buttons
[21:51:01] <Assimilater> but no need for hidden fields, buttons, text boxes, radio buttons check boxes etc
[21:51:23] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Howto/Toolbar_Customization
[21:54:40] <magn3ts> Um... is DatePicker broken? http://jsfiddle.net/ZbCTa/
[21:55:22] <magn3ts> never mind, I'm an idiot
[21:59:28] <Assimilater> ajpiano: so do i put a toolbar somewhere in the constructor
[22:00:26] <Assimilater> ajpiano: sorry to bog you with questions that are in this doc, i just can't seem to find them :S
[22:00:32] <ajpiano> ... did you go to http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Toolbar
[22:00:55] <Assimilater> i went to this: http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html#.toolbar
[22:00:59] <ajpiano> right
[22:01:02] <Assimilater> first visible portion of screen looks the same
[22:01:03] <ajpiano> well read the page i sent you
[22:09:28] <sluther> hi guys, i have the following HTML & jQuery: http://pastebin.com/t2tUHRDz I'm trying to remove the 'li' when the button is clicked. I know I have to use .remove(), but I can't seem to figure out how to target the li from the e.target DOM. e.target.attr('id') doesn't work, and e.target.parent() doesn't either.. any ideas?
[22:10:21] <ajpiano> $(e.target).parent()
[22:10:26] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("li")
[22:10:27] <ajpiano> etc
[22:10:42] <sluther> ajpiano: thanks, i just saw in the docs $(event.target) right as you said that
[22:10:44] <sluther> but thanks :D
[22:10:56] <ajpiano> this == e.target
[22:10:57] <ajpiano> fyi
[22:11:20] <sluther> so $(this).parent() would work, too?
[22:11:44] <ajpiano> yep
[22:11:54] <ajpiano> your problem was you were calling jquery methods on a DOM element before
[22:12:06] <sluther> yeah, i gotcha
[22:12:27] <sluther> I just didn't know how to select the DOM object using jquery
[22:20:03] <Whirl3d> how do I set the zindex with jquery? $("#item").css("zIndex",20); doesn't seem to work. Neither does $("#item").css("z-index",20);
[22:21:07] <Assimilater> ajpiano: does the toolbar *have* to be in the config.js file? I tried putting a toolbar identified by config.toolbar= 'emailToolbar' in assimilater.jquery.js and this appears to create the standard toolbar: $('.Email textarea').ckeditor({}, {toolbar: 'emailToolbar'});
[22:21:39] <ajpiano> i don't know
[22:22:10] <Assimilater> this look about right? http://pastie.org/2246806
[22:22:13] <versatiletech> Whirl3d: did you set position in the CSS to relative or absolute?
[22:22:42] <Whirl3d> versatiletech, not sure. Lemme check . Thanks for the reply.
[22:23:51] <Whirl3d> versatiletech, they are not explicitly declared, but the images are in an absolutely positioned div
[22:24:19] <ajpiano> Assimilater: according to the docs
[22:24:34] <ajpiano> the first arg to the ckeditor() method is supposed to be a function
[22:24:56] <Assimilater> oh i'm missing the keyword...
[22:24:59] <Assimilater> oops :S
[22:25:15] <ajpiano> you might be able to use that function to add your config parms or something
[22:25:24] <Assimilater> really?
[22:25:30] <Assimilater> i wasn't quite getting the need for that function...
[22:25:36] <ajpiano> i have no idea, i'm just guessing
[22:25:39] <Assimilater> k
[22:26:25] <ajpiano> Assimilater: it looks like it *does* have to be in the config.js
[22:26:45] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Setting_Configurations
[22:27:07] <versatiletech> Whirl3d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Understanding_CSS_z-index/The_stacking_context
[22:27:08] <ajpiano> If the customConfig setting has been set "in-page", that file is loaded, otherwise the default config.js file is loaded. All settings in the custom configuration file override current instance settings.
[22:27:11] <Assimilater> oooh
[22:28:02] <versatiletech> whatever you are applying the z-index to, make sure it has a position of absolute or relative
[22:28:28] <Assimilater> ooh there we go
[22:28:33] <Assimilater> hello hello
[22:28:33] <versatiletech> I'm not sure what you want to do
[22:28:36] <Assimilater> thanks ajpiano :)
[22:28:48] <ajpiano> welx :)
[22:29:13] <ajpiano> i think you've used up your me-reading-the-docs-for-you allocation for now ;)
[22:29:29] <ajpiano> but i'm glad it's working
[22:29:57] <Assimilater> lol, sorry i'm really not very experienced at finding docs....
[22:30:04] <Assimilater> i finally got used to jquery's documentation
[22:30:08] <Assimilater> and then i find this new thing....
[22:30:19] <Assimilater> i've also gotten good with php.net
[22:30:35] <seancurtis> booo - I can't do .foo:after { content: ""; display: table-cell; }
[22:30:42] <seancurtis> that sucks
[22:30:43] <seancurtis> :(
[22:31:55] <Whirl3d> versatiletech, I decided to check the zindex of the image I am fading in. If it's > than the new image, I show the new image and fade out the old. If not, I fade in the new and then hide the old. It kind of works, but not really.
[22:34:58] <versatiletech> seancurtis: hmm should be able to, let me check
[22:35:40] <seancurtis> versatiletech: nm - I was doing it wrong
[22:35:57] <seancurtis> didn't realise that it puts the pseudo element inside that one
[22:36:03] <seancurtis> thought it went "after" the element
[22:36:10] <seancurtis> not after the content of the element
[22:36:36] <seancurtis> was trying to do equal height rounded panels using display table/table cell
[22:36:47] <seancurtis> and using the pseudo elements as gaps between the cells
[22:37:02] <seancurtis> can't use margins on display: table-cell :(
[22:39:56] <versatiletech> seancurtis: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/tables.html
[22:40:05] <versatiletech> try border-spacing
[22:40:34] <seancurtis> oooh
[22:53:58] <Assimilater> can i determine how tall an object *would* be if it were visible while it's hidden?
[22:54:22] <ajpiano> position it off screen and show it
[22:54:29] <ajpiano> and get it's .height()
[22:54:31] <ajpiano> at that point
[22:54:43] <Assimilater> position it off screen?
[22:54:55] <ajpiano> position:absolute;left: -1000px;
[22:55:07] <Assimilater> oh
[22:55:24] <Assimilater> and this will work for display: block as well?
[22:55:56] <Assimilater> i guess real question is would it retain the width based on its parent container
[22:56:00] <ajpiano> that's pretty much what it's designed for
[22:56:03] <ajpiano> no
[22:56:04] <ajpiano> it wouldn't
[22:56:09] <ajpiano> if it was just auto
[22:56:26] <ajpiano> well, it could potentially
[22:56:30] <ajpiano> you have to test and experiment
[22:57:00] <dsdeiz> hi! say i have $('#foo').submit(function() { $('#foo input').somefunction(); } is it the same when it's $(this + ' input').somefunction()?
[22:57:17] <ajpiano> well, the second thing doesn't work
[22:57:31] <ajpiano> you can't concatenate an object to a string
[22:57:37] <dsdeiz> yea
[22:57:43] <dsdeiz> do i have to use children or sth?
[22:57:49] <ajpiano> $(this).find("input"{)
[22:57:56] <dsdeiz> ahh
[22:57:57] <dsdeiz> thx
[23:04:17] <Assimilater> huh go figure it works
[23:04:24] <Assimilater> thanks again ajpiano :)
[23:04:40] <coldhead> no one is talking about clojurescript
[23:05:33] <coldhead> sup JSBracher
[23:05:41] <coldhead> >: |
[23:05:52] <hrwath> fail
[23:05:56] <coldhead> seriously
[23:06:01] <coldhead> gone self harm, brb
[23:06:48] <coldhead> sup oodavid
[23:06:49] <Whirl3d> remember, down the alley, not across the road
[23:06:58] <coldhead> bahahah thanks Whirl3d
[23:07:03] <Whirl3d> np
[23:07:32] <Whirl3d> of course you know it scares me that you know that reference and all.
[23:08:56] <coldhead> i don't, it's just immediately intuitive
[23:09:04] <Whirl3d> pfew
[23:11:15] <ajpiano> yeah all i had to do was think about that for a sec and i got the chills
[23:11:48] <coldhead> that's because you love life
[23:11:53] <coldhead> it gives me a peaceful feeling
[23:11:58] <Whirl3d> I just hate sewing idiots up
[23:12:04] <coldhead> hahahaha
[23:12:15] <coldhead> that is the human condition right there
[23:14:33] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/3B77Y/.. having an issue with the last line.. trying to pass .text() to a data object
[23:14:44] <danieliser> if i console.log that value returns correct.. but doesnt get passed into my .load()
[23:16:47] <danieliser> anybody there?
[23:19:16] <Whirl3d> danieliser, use a "," instead of a ":"
[23:19:30] <Whirl3d> oh wait,
[23:20:19] <danieliser> no that throws a flag
[23:20:54] <Whirl3d> what are you using the data object for. I thought you were using $(item).data(someobj);
[23:21:01] <coldhead> don't quote clientid
[23:21:10] <coldhead> or do
[23:21:12] <coldhead> i dono
[23:21:19] <danieliser> $(this.children('td').eq(0).text() is the problem.. the clientId variable posts empty
[23:21:19] <coldhead> the point is i looked at your code
[23:21:22] <coldhead> give me a medal
[23:21:33] <Whirl3d> +1 coldhead
[23:22:05] <danieliser> clientId works eitherway quotes or not.. just shows up emtpy.. and if i console.log() $(this.children('td').eq(0).text() it returns the right value i need.. but wont return it into the data object
[23:22:07] <danieliser> lol
[23:22:34] <coldhead> are you sure you need to provide a nested object?
[23:23:25] <danieliser> yea.. it needs to accept more parameters if i need it to..
[23:23:46] <danieliser> using this to call different options panels into a modal..
[23:24:47] <danieliser> but im also setting up the emodal plugin for expansion later
[23:25:48] <danieliser> any ideas how to pass that value through?
[23:26:06] <coldhead> it really looks like the right way to do it
[23:26:10] <donCams> hi... how to do this? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/ are they loading the pages before displaying them?
[23:26:15] <coldhead> but i don't know emodal
[23:26:30] <coldhead> might have to debug the damn thing
[23:27:08] <Paganini> Something ridiculously simple, how can I convert my .html() value to an integer? or is there a better method of getting the int from the span?
[23:27:30] <danieliser> coldhead: thats what i thought.. but its not returning anything.. and emodal is just something im working on for myself and a WP plugin i released Easy Modal
[23:27:50] <jazzy_> Hi All, How could I navigate to `anchor` part of the link if the part of the page that needs to be navigated appears as a response to an xhr request?
[23:28:00] <danieliser> coldhead: how to debug it better?
[23:28:09] <coldhead> console.log(options)
[23:28:15] <coldhead> where options is where you expect to see that data
[23:28:32] <danieliser> tried that.. returns horribly or empty..
[23:28:51] <coldhead> horribly sounds promising
[23:28:53] <coldhead> try more of that
[23:30:24] <coldhead> ?mdc parseint @ Paganini
[23:30:34] <danieliser> returns empty object
[23:30:49] <coldhead> Paganini: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[23:30:57] <coldhead> danieliser: what you have there should not be empty
[23:31:14] <coldhead> include something else as well, lol: 'aids' or soething
[23:31:23] <coldhead> if you can't see that then you may have the wrong variable name
[23:31:33] <donCams> help! i need to load an external html in an iframe but I need to know first if the page has loaded before I start the animation and append the iframe in a div and I want the iframe to have the height and width of the external page. as this is homework, hints/tips would be awesome...
[23:31:54] <danieliser> i console.log(data) inside the dbclick function
[23:33:14] <Assimilater> hey does anyone know if firebug has a limit on how much post data it will show? with this code: http://pastie.org/2247038 i only see the to and message values in the post tab of the logged ajax event in the console and i'm wondering if it's something to be concerned about
[23:34:24] <danieliser> other var passes correctly.. wtf
[23:34:42] <donCams> T_T
[23:34:48] <danieliser> anyway to convert it to string inline?
[23:35:12] <coldhead> .toString()
[23:35:27] <coldhead> or JSON.stringify ()
[23:37:22] <Assimilater> just verified in php
[23:37:29] <Assimilater> post data for 'subject' is not being received
[23:37:33] <Assimilater> any ideas why not?
[23:38:30] <Assimilater> oh wait, nvm
[23:38:39] <ghufran> Hi. i have a form which is posted through ajax. now i want to add file upload functionality to it as well. is it easily possible ? or would i have to use some custom plugin?
[23:38:49] <Assimilater> about .find() returning an empty object because i didn't put that attr comparison in [ ] 's.....
[23:38:52] * Assimilater facepalms
[23:39:18] <coldhead> ghufran: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[23:39:24] <coldhead> not easy, use that guy ^^
[23:40:02] <coldhead> Assimilater: you should read the jQuery source to see how it actually parses your selector. you'll make fewer mistakes like taht :)
[23:40:52] <ghufran> coldhead, problem is i don't want to just upload a file.. also want to store other data in the form .. do i just put that in data?
[23:40:54] <danieliser> coldhead: could it be the selector? since im selecting the table its not finding the children properly i think
[23:41:09] <ghufran> actually, let me read the documentation or something
[23:41:28] <coldhead> danieliser: sounds worth checking out
[23:41:52] <coldhead> ghufran: good luck. ajax file uploads are hard. that plugin has the best reputation i think
[23:42:00] <coldhead> so lean as hard as possible on it
[23:42:07] <ghufran> okay
[23:42:27] <ghufran> i'm inclined to switch to classic form instead
[23:42:41] <ghufran> don't want to get into this mess..
[23:42:45] <coldhead> that's fine with me :)
[23:44:08] <mekwall> donCams: was that even a question, or just a statement?
[23:44:54] <Assimilater> coldhead: i'm not sure what you mean...it's just a css selector that i goofed up on?
[23:45:11] <danieliser> is it because im trying to call $(this) outside of a function?
[23:46:50] <coldhead> Assimilater: i mean once you see the actual string processing jQUery uses to turn your selector into actual DOM elements, you have a much better idea of what does what
[23:47:17] <coldhead> it helps you write faster selectors and more correct selectors
[23:47:29] <mekwall> ghufran: uploading with ajax is handled just as if you were posting it traditionally
[23:47:33] <coldhead> but hey, you probably have better things to do than read the jQuery source
[23:47:34] <Assimilater> coldhead: maybe, but i don't know about 'less mistakes'
[23:47:40] <coldhead> fewer mistakes*
[23:47:48] <coldhead> well it worked for me :D
[23:47:52] <Assimilater> coldhead: well only because i'm going to mongolia for two years in august :P
[23:48:01] <Assimilater> coldhead: otherwise i would
[23:48:19] <coldhead> take a print out!
[23:48:25] <mekwall> jquery and internet doesn't exist in mongolia? :)
[23:48:26] <Assimilater> lol
[23:48:30] <Assimilater> no they do
[23:48:46] <coldhead> enerel is #jQuery's resident mongolian
[23:48:46] <Demia> take a kindle with the source of jquery on it.. i like this idea
[23:48:50] <coldhead> you should talk to him
[23:48:52] <coldhead> he has a cute kid
[23:49:00] <mekwall> I bet that's where the Khan Academy has its HQ ;)
[23:49:07] <Demia> coldhead what does his kid have to do with it? haha
[23:49:08] <Assimilater> but technological access is limited under the rules i'll be follwing
[23:49:47] <coldhead> mongol babies are cuties
[23:49:53] <coldhead> it's not my fault
[23:50:02] <Demia> haha i didnt deny that it just seemed... well random
[23:51:01] <coldhead> enerel is a bit random
[23:51:03] <coldhead> it's fine
[23:51:11] <coldhead> we're all brothers and sisters in jquery here
[23:51:34] <coldhead> however closely we;re related to ghengis khan or gypsies
[23:51:35] <Demia> truth fact.
[23:52:01] <mekwall> or hitler
[23:52:05] <coldhead> OR HITLER
[23:52:18] <mekwall> just sayin'
[23:52:20] <Demia> ...... OMG!
[23:52:47] <Whirl3d> what rules will you be following. since no one else will ask
[23:53:03] <Whirl3d> Are you going to a monestary or prison?
[23:53:03] <mekwall> Whirl3d: that's one of the rules
[23:53:14] <Whirl3d> aha! I should've known
[23:53:24] <mekwall> :D
[23:54:19] <Whirl3d> Never been on that side of the planet before.
[23:55:06] <djQuery> why are my droggables not dragable after the first time? http://jsbin.com/apesih/8/edit
[23:55:17] <Whirl3d> Though I plan to head to Helsinki and then to St. Petersburg in a month...
[23:56:02] <Demia> djQuery: well for one you called them droggables.
[23:56:17] <djQuery> .draggable
[23:56:35] <systemfault> How about druggables :/
[23:56:42] <Demia> djQuery: any errors in firebug or chrome console?
[23:56:51] <djQuery> nope
[23:57:04] <Whirl3d> <--definitely enjoys the druggables.
[23:57:46] <djQuery> appears that it is something in my stop
[23:58:25] <Demia> Whirl3d: who doesn't!
[23:58:36] <Whirl3d> djQuery, what am I supposed to do to see the problem?
[23:59:06] <djQuery> drag 1 of the tables around
[23:59:21] <djQuery> then do it again and see that u cant
[23:59:22] <Demia> djQuery: doesn't work even from the beginning for me.
[23:59:29] <Whirl3d> no tables here
