[00:17:13] <rgr> in a jQuery.fn function I have a line 'this.find(".disabledevent").each(function() {'... but its not finding anything despite me knowing there are elements with a class .disabledevent. Am I doing something obviously wrong in the context of jQuery.fn .
[00:19:14] <pajo> how can i prevent input click propagation in jquery ui accordion's header? $('input').click(function(e){e.stopPropagation()}) doesnt work with that
[00:21:07] <pajo> nvm, got it to work :D
[00:23:52] <jarco> This rule is not working in chrome. The box shadow is not applied. When i add the css by hand on the element it does get added. What am i doing wrong? $(this).parent().css({'border':'3px solid #fff','box-shadow':'2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.09'});
[00:25:26] <jarco> nvm :)
[00:25:28] <jarco> stupid me
[00:40:40] <bigLanky> http://screencast.com/t/LtyoJTwh5
[00:40:55] <bigLanky> anyone know of a jquery plugin that i can use that will let me pass in latitude/longitude coordinates and generate a map like this?
[00:41:20] <geekie> Ooh, looks like risk *wants to play*
[00:44:18] <majd> hey #jquery - i have a callback function to an ajax call that for some reason is being called twice
[00:44:44] <majd> how can i find out where is the function being called?
[00:44:46] <olly_c> bigLanky might not be perfect but you could have a look at http://jqvmap.com/
[00:45:01] <Allan_> hello verybody
[00:45:24] <Allan_> jquery 1.8.1 has been released,
[00:46:04] <bigLanky> http://www.red-team-design.com/image-map-with-css3-jquery-tooltips
[00:53:12] <Guddu_> Should i call .parent().parent() twice or is there a way to find the previous <tr> using something else?
[00:53:42] <rgr> is there a shorter syntax for this : this.each(function() {if($(this).hasClass("disabledevent")){
[00:56:16] <Guddu_> Please help
[00:57:41] <NodeX> Guddu_ : you can use parents();
[01:00:41] <Guddu_> NodeX, Thanks for your help. In my case, the html is http://dpaste.org/54wk6/ ... Using $parent.find('.quantity').val() I am getting the quantity....But when i use $parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').val() all i get is blank :(
[01:02:05] <Guddu_> NodeX, In this case the jquery is called when i edit this element <input type="text" name="quantity" size="20" class="quantity" value="1">
[01:03:12] <rgr> is there a shorter syntax for this : this.each(function() {if($(this).hasClass("disabledevent")){
[01:04:16] <bastetmilo> Quick question - I have script that check if screen resolution is portrait or landscape and do something. But I want it to refresh page after portrait is change to landscape - but ofcours only once after the orientation is changed. To reload page i will use location.reload(); - but how to make it reload once?
[01:04:27] <rgr> or in other words I just want to each on the current selector for thos elements having a certain class.
[01:05:56] <Guddu_> I just noticed that $parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').val() does not work but $parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').html() works on This simple html <td width="10%" class="reg_item_inventory" style="width: 77px; ">-18</td>
[01:06:11] <Guddu_> Could someone please telll why val does not work?
[01:06:52] <opalepatrick> trying to target the submit button of a form inside a div with id 'notes_form' - $("#notes").on("submit", function(){ - any pointers? or even links re. targetting form elements
[01:07:09] <opalepatrick> sorry id notes
[01:07:54] <seutje> Guddu_: table cells don't have a value
[01:07:58] <seutje> ?val @ Guddu_
[01:07:59] <bot-t> Guddu_, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[01:08:13] <seutje> it's for inputs n stuff
[01:08:20] <Guddu_> seutje, So i should stick to html () only?
[01:08:28] <seutje> well, .text will suffice
[01:08:37] <seutje> but I guess html is more performant
[01:08:44] <seutje> or wait
[01:09:20] <Guddu_> seutje, Is it ok to compare result of .val() to  .html() like in if ($parent.find('.quantity').val() > $parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').html())
[01:11:11] <Guddu_> seutje, One more question. If i call 3 Functions and 1st Function returns False then 2nd and 3rd functions will still be called? Here is my code to call those three functions.
[01:11:11] <Guddu_> $(document).on('keyup', 'table#register input.quantity', function(event) {checkInventory();sumPrice();submitDiscount();});
[01:11:34] <seutje> Guddu_: you should parseInt or parseFloat them
[01:11:45] <seutje> otherwise ur comparing strings
[01:12:18] <Guddu_> seutje, Ok. I just checked that even val and html comprison works as if those were integers. But parseint or parsefloat is the best to use.
[01:12:19] <seutje> Guddu_: yeah, unless you add operators in between
[01:12:35] <seutje> are you asking which to use or making a statement?
[01:13:02] <Guddu_> seutje, Making a statement. I will use parseint as suggested by u. Just telling u my findings.
[01:13:15] <seutje> oh ok, can't tell, haven't had a full cup of coffee e
[01:13:17] <seutje> yet
[01:13:41] <Guddu_> seutje, To not call all 3 functions in that example, shall i call 2nd or 3rd based on return value of first and second only?
[01:13:46] <seutje> also functionThatWillReturnTrue() && functionThatWillReturnFalse() && functionThatWillNeverRun();
[01:14:29] <rahmen> Hi! Is it possible to attach a function to an element? Say I want to be able to edit a table row by clicking edit. Instead of having a global function editRowWithId(id) I'd like to do something like tr.edit = function () { ... }
[01:14:29] <seutje> but functionThatWillReturnFalse() || functionThatWillReturnTrue() || functionThatWillNeverRun();
[01:14:40] <seutje> ... I think
[01:14:57] <Guddu_> seutje, I am confused :)
[01:15:08] <radiodario> morning
[01:15:40] <seutje> Guddu_: also, when using on, try to limit the scope, in your example, if your table will always be in the page, call on like $('#register').on('keyup', 'input.quantity', function() {});
[01:15:57] <seutje> Guddu_: && will run until it hits false
[01:16:04] <seutje> || will run until it hits true
[01:16:07] <seutje> ... I think
[01:16:49] <opalepatrick> tried $("#notes form").on("submit", function(){ - but this isnt triggering either - (form has #notes id)
[01:17:42] <Guddu_> seutje, I am using document selector because that elemtns is added dynamicallly....I read somewhere that we need to do it that way.
[01:19:15] <seutje> Guddu_: the && || stuff illustrated: http://jsfiddle.net/E8b9y/
[01:19:26] <Guddu_> Thanks seutje
[01:20:17] <seutje> Guddu_: the form itself is added dynamically as well? then I guess that's fine, but try to limit the context to the closest wrapper that never changes
[01:20:35] <seutje> opalepatrick: remove the " form"
[01:20:42] <nVee> hey guys, is there a way that I can set the $.post() command to not append the full url to the url: parameter?
[01:21:00] <pllx> Hi ! I'm learning jQuery using the starterkit tutorial, and I'm failing at the 1st ajax post : using $.post("http://myServer/rate.php" ,   send data to my server, but I dont get any xml result ...
[01:21:11] <seutje> IDs are suppose to be unique anyway, and if the form has that ID, u'd need "form#notes" instead of "#notes form" anyway
[01:21:21] <nVee> we're using cakephp and I need to post to a different controller
[01:21:29] <nVee> but it appends the url with the controller, so I cannot change it
[01:26:31] <pranavrc> I'm reading a JSON file and assigning its contents into a string inside a getJSON function nested within another function. When I try to return this string from the outer function, it fails. How do I fix this?
[01:30:34] <opalepatrick> Thanks seutje, so that should target that form by its id. I am still getting the form submitted in a manual way so that it refreshes. Better do a paste
[01:31:15] <rgr> I'm getting a little confused as to $(this) and this. if I have something lke $(".myclass",this).hover(function(){}); inside hte hover function $(this) is the single element instance right?
[01:31:30] <seutje> opalepatrick: are u doing a event.preventDefault()?
[01:32:00] <opalepatrick> no that was next :-) - like event.stopPropagation(); ?
[01:32:03] <opalepatrick> seutje,
[01:32:08] <seutje> rgr: inside that handler "this" is the element triggering the event, $(this) is just a jQuery collection with just that element
[01:32:26] <seutje> opalepatrick: stopPropagation isn't the same as preventDefault
[01:32:29] <rgr> yeah , thats what I thought (or knew), The error must be elsewhere. Thanks for the confirmation.
[01:32:43] <seutje> stopPropagation stops the event from bubbling up iirc
[01:33:47] <Guddu_> seutje, is it important to put a ; after every if and else like if {};
[01:34:52] <seutje> Guddu_: no, use a tool like JSHint and it'll tell you it's an unnecessary semicolon :)
[01:34:59] <Guddu_> Ok :)
[01:35:01] <seutje> Guddu_: what editor do you use?
[01:35:09] <Guddu_> seutje, notepad ++
[01:35:13] <seutje> oh
[01:35:16] <seutje> I'm sorry :P
[01:35:17] <postoy> preventDefault typically works on events that will normally occur without JS. Say, if you click on a link, you prevent it from doing what it normally does.
[01:35:58] <seutje> ?g npp jshint plugin
[01:35:59] <bot-t> seutje, JSLint Plugin for Notepad++ | Free Development software ... - http://sourceforge.net/projects/jslintnpp/
[01:36:02] <seutje> :D
[01:36:09] <seutje> although lint can be a bit brutal :(
[01:36:21] <tocka> hey guys
[01:36:21] <Guddu_> brutal? Why? :(
[01:36:42] <tocka> wanted to ask, I have 5 divs being generated by bx-slider, how could I remove the last one with all its contents? http://pastie.org/4627516
[01:36:57] <postoy> .remove
[01:37:12] <postoy> $(div:last).remove();
[01:37:12] <tocka> postoy
[01:37:18] <tocka> and it will remove all the contents also?
[01:37:21] <postoy> yes.
[01:37:22] <tocka> inside it?
[01:37:24] <opalepatrick> thanks seutje
[01:37:25] <postoy> yes.
[01:37:25] <tocka> thanks :)
[01:37:35] <postoy> I didn't look at your code, so tailor it.
[01:38:06] <tocka> oh ok
[01:38:12] <tocka> and if I wanted to remove 2nd div?
[01:38:23] <postoy> what do you think?
[01:38:44] <postoy> How do you select the second div?
[01:38:53] <seutje> Guddu_: jshint is more loose and allows for more configuration
[01:38:58] <Navyman> kk
[01:39:01] <Guddu_> Oh ok
[01:39:02] <seutje> jslint will sometimes make you cry
[01:39:09] <seutje> s/sometimes/often
[01:39:38] <tocka> and is it possible to change places? lets say 5 goes to 2nd place and 2nd goes to 5th?
[01:39:41] <Guddu_> seutje, Not ready for anything brutal as yet :)
[01:39:55] <postoy> tocka: You can use css selectors or treat it like an array.
[01:39:57] <Guddu_> In a while i will be not now :)
[01:40:13] <seutje> Guddu_: you can use the site to check with jshint
[01:40:18] <Tram> Good morning all, anyone here knows if its possible to communitate events between tabs?
[01:40:24] <seutje> it'll just flag with warnings
[01:40:43] <postoy> tocka: maybe use clone();
[01:41:10] <postoy> clone the contents of 2nd and 5th, then replace.
[01:41:21] <postoy> remove and replace.
[01:42:27] <postoy> or you can simply switch the order.
[01:43:04] <seutje> postoy: try to avoid the faux-css selectors -> http://jsperf.com/faux-css-vs-method
[01:43:13] <rgr> I can use find to locate an element. But whats he jquery way to say "if you dont find this element then do something"? First select and then if the length is not > 0 or is there a sharper find() way?
[01:43:24] <Guddu_> seutje,  I am totally doomed. On line 15 I am getting that alert and returning false also but somehow it is still going to line 38 where it asks me to confirm order http://dpaste.org/4p0ZW/
[01:45:17] <seutje> Guddu_: avoid using alert, and returning false inside an .each() loop just bails out of the loop
[01:45:42] <Guddu_> seutje, Ok. So i will try to set some variable and check for value of variabe outside loop :)
[01:46:02] <Guddu_> seutje, If not alert then what shall i use for informing errors to my users?
[01:46:10] <seutje> rgr: $(element).length && doSomething();
[01:46:29] <seutje> Guddu_: oh, to the user, I thought this was debugging
[01:46:48] <Guddu_> seutje, I added some alert to debug also. Then i have some for user also.
[01:46:53] <seutje> Guddu_: perhaps a lovely modal window with the massage? :D
[01:47:10] <seutje> problem with alert is that it halts execution and sometimes causes shit to break
[01:47:29] <Guddu_> seutje, I always wanted to use modal windows but then i could not figure out how to incorporate those instead of alerts.
[01:48:06] <seutje> Guddu_: also, instead of using an anonymous function the size of arkansas, try abstracting it to a re-usable function, it makes the whole lot a ton more readable
[01:48:59] <seutje> like $('#foo').on('click', myHandler); function myHandler(e) { /* COADZ */ }
[01:49:24] <postoy> seutje: I can't believe it's that much faster to use .last versus :last.
[01:49:27] <seutje> cause trying to read this is quite painful
[01:49:29] <Guddu_> seutje, Ok
[01:50:14] <seutje> postoy: why not? saves jQuery a function call to abstract that faux-css selector and I think it'll use .last internally anyway
[01:50:49] <postoy> sure, but more than half the time? hey zeus.
[01:51:12] <pllx> ll
[01:51:29] <pllx> oops. sorry
[01:53:39] <seutje> postoy: afaik, sizzle needs to run a regex to abstract that, and regex in js are costly
[01:54:36] <faraway> postoy, seutje: yes  :last is not known by querySelectorAll  so sizzle needs to be run if :last ist used
[01:54:44] <postoy> seutje: so the faux css is traversed with regex?
[01:55:27] <faraway> postoy: every selector that is not known by querySelectorAll or known to be buggy is traversed with sizzle
[01:56:05] <postoy> faraway, seutje: thank you. you both just gave me a lot of insight.
[01:56:54] <seutje> postoy: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L80
[01:57:05] <seutje> not entirely sure if that's the correct reference though :D
[01:57:32] <postoy> thanks so much for that!!
[01:57:57] <seutje> (reason even/odd are in there are cause of IE failing at dynamically looking those up, I think)
[01:57:59] <postoy> this is my first time in the room trying to help. who knew, i got helped!!
[01:58:00] <faraway> postoy: you can always do a document.querySelectorAll with your selector to see it it is supported nativly by the browser (but even it it is sizzle could be triggered cause of some bugs in the querySelectorAll implementation)
[01:58:30] <Guddu_> seutje, Can i replace alerts with modal without changing  alot of codE?
[01:58:45] <seutje> Guddu_: sure, depending on the modal plugin you use
[02:01:27] <postoy> faraway: Thanks! You guys are great. I need to be learning all the innards of the library itself and how to improve.
[02:03:11] <Guddu_> seutje, Which one is the best according to you?
[02:03:52] <pangelovski> hi guys
[02:04:57] <pangelovski> I'm followed andy matthew's guide for creating custom button icons. however when i apply his example, the images in the icon are not aligned correctly, the are too up. is there  a way to move them down a bit?
[02:04:59] <postoy> Guddu_: modal plug-in?
[02:05:04] <bastetmilo> can anyone could tell me why this http://pastebin.com/XmDmx2yE don't work after chagne from landscape to portait orientation?
[02:05:11] <Guddu_> Thanks postoy Will try that now
[02:05:33] <postoy> Guddu_: Just a question, didn't give you a link. ;)
[02:05:58] <postoy> Guddu_: I think colorbox (?) is still supported and light weight.
[02:05:59] <Guddu_> postoy, yes. Will google. I was basically looking to change my alerts with something without changing my code too much :)
[02:06:17] <Guddu_> postoy, Yes.. i want a modal plugin
[02:06:49] <postoy> Guddu_: Colorbox‚Ä¶ http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/example2/
[02:07:02] <postoy> Guddu_: or you can use the modal in jQuery ui.
[02:07:16] <q[corwin]> Howdy.  I don't know if jQuery really offeres a solution for this, but it was my first thought.  I have two websites.  a let's you download a file, b lets you upload a file.  Is there a clever way to use jQuery to unite these?
[02:07:21] <seutje> Guddu_: for simple stuff, I usually use simplemodal, it's very lightweight
[02:07:30] <seutje> haven't used it in a while though
[02:08:02] <Guddu_> Thanks will evaluate
[02:09:29] <postoy> a[corwin]: unite them how? what do you mean?
[02:10:38] <q[corwin]> I mean, I'd like to have the user click button on site B and have the file automagically be downloaded from site A and uploaded to site B
[02:10:58] <postoy> you have control of both sites?
[02:11:12] <q[corwin]> Mostly.  More control of site B.
[02:11:37] <postoy> I think you need to do something server-side.
[02:12:18] <jarco> Window load does wait untill the browser is done right?
[02:12:33] <postoy> no.
[02:12:42] <postoy> not the browser.
[02:12:45] <postoy> just the window.
[02:12:50] <postoy> do something like this...
[02:12:52] <q[corwin]> The really trickly bit is that site A has internally implemented authentication and I don't want to put any Site A authen info into Site B.
[02:13:07] <postoy> jQuery(window).bind('load', function(){});
[02:13:39] <jarco> postoy, I am trying to get the height of a div. But it gets 0 so I guess the div is not build yet when I ask for its height. Will your funtion avoid that?
[02:13:48] <q[corwin]> I want it to work if the user has already authenticated with Site A, and not otherwise.
[02:13:53] <postoy> jarco: yes.
[02:14:05] <jarco> postoy, great i will try it now.
[02:14:29] <postoy> jarco: it will also wait until all images are loaded, so pay attention.
[02:14:48] <jarco> postoy, that actually exactly what I want
[02:15:00] <postoy> jarco: you're all set!
[02:15:35] <jarco> I was folliwing this blog. But seems the info aboput window.load is not accurate thenhttp://4loc.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/documentready-vs-windowload/
[02:16:22] <postoy> It's accurate.
[02:16:34] <jarco> That confuses me
[02:16:40] <postoy> lol.
[02:16:53] <PlasmaBunny> what is the best way to implement free will?
[02:16:59] <anli_> What up with those checkboxes with checked="checked" that does not appear to be checked?
[02:17:03] <jarco> If it waits for the images etc why do I get a result of height 0 on (window).load
[02:17:23] <postoy> jarco: good question.
[02:17:43] <jarco> PlasmaBunny, LEt the subject (or element) be completely alone for its entire life. It is the only way to ensure free will
[02:17:46] <jarco> :)
[02:17:54] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: nope.
[02:18:02] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: i have a neural net implemented in jquery
[02:18:06] <PlasmaBunny> it can predict and classify
[02:18:14] <PlasmaBunny> but it can't 'want' to do something
[02:18:17] <PlasmaBunny> or decide to do something
[02:18:19] <PlasmaBunny> on its own
[02:18:31] <PlasmaBunny> how can i implement this feature?
[02:18:36] <PlasmaBunny> ( random won't do )
[02:18:40] <jarco> Ah then the better response is. Motivate it to make a choice
[02:18:51] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: and what is motivation in terms of neural net?
[02:19:00] <postoy> jarco: I can guess at a lot of factors. Sorry I don't have specific answers for you right now. Maybe someone else can jump in. But I know if you bind 'load', it will work.
[02:19:01] <jarco> That my sir I do not know
[02:19:15] <jarco> Will try that postoy
[02:20:22] <q[corwin]> PlasmaBunny, you sure you aren't looking for #lsip?
[02:20:27] <q[corwin]> *lisp
[02:20:28] <postoy> jarco: binding load pretty much acts like a preloader. I'm guessing that's what you want.
[02:21:14] <jarco> postoy, even with binding it it still gives the result of 0
[02:21:39] <jarco> AUCH
[02:21:44] <jarco> my selector might be off!
[02:22:11] <faraway> PlasmaBunny: it is a long time that i looked a neuronal networks, but i'm sure as long as you don't have something to learn or an aim, it won't do anything. cause it needs input to do something
[02:23:00] <bartmax> you smart people (i know is not the channel, but im desperate):  this rule: rewritecond %{http_host} !^www\.promosamba\.com [nc] is not getting www.promosamba.com.py which i need. anyone can light my way?
[02:23:11] <bartmax> it's 6:23 am in the morning ... be kind pls
[02:23:55] <PlasmaBunny> faraway: i give it input
[02:24:07] <PlasmaBunny> but this doesn't spawn free will
[02:24:07] <Phil-Work> bartmax, that's a rewritecond
[02:24:13] <Phil-Work> have you told it what to do if the condition is met
[02:24:16] <bartmax> Phil-Work: yes
[02:24:17] <Phil-Work> +?
[02:24:25] <PlasmaBunny> q[corwin]: no, why?
[02:24:25] <bartmax> Phil-Work: then i have a simple redirect rule
[02:24:32] <bartmax> Phil-Work: but it's not matching
[02:24:34] <postoy> jarco: it might be. ;)
[02:25:13] <postoy> jarco: throw it on pastebin if you can't sort it out.
[02:25:37] <jarco> postoy, I got it now
[02:25:44] <postoy> jarco: works?
[02:25:47] <jarco> Yes.
[02:25:50] <jarco> With your funtion it did
[02:26:03] <postoy> jarco: have a beer!
[02:26:43] <jarco> you have one also. When you are near Limburg, belgium. I will buy you one :‡)
[02:27:22] <postoy> jarco: Can I take your word on that? I've been wanting to head back to Europe.
[02:27:26] <postoy> lol.
[02:27:36] <jarco> Of course you can :)
[02:27:50] <postoy> awesome!
[02:28:16] <jarco> I live in Genk, Belgium. Come see me :)
[02:28:17] <PlasmaBunny> hi. i need to implement a free will with jquery
[02:28:23] <PlasmaBunny> what is the easiest way to do it?
[02:28:24] <jarco> I will get you that beer and order some pizza
[02:28:44] <jarco> PlasmaBunny, You aren't kidding are you?
[02:29:17] <Guddu_> seutje, Found a very weird issue. On my text input box, if i enter 0100 then the parseint method is returning 64 to me when i do parseInt($parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').html())
[02:29:27] <postoy> I've never been to Belgium, I would love to see it. Wow. Now I just have to convince my colleges to work with me a different timezone. If I can, I'll take you up on it.
[02:30:00] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: no.
[02:30:10] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: free will is the last thing i need to implement
[02:30:16] <Guddu_> postoy, U r welcome to Chile whenever u feel like.
[02:30:17] <jarco> I am always here in this channel so just give me a heads up and it will be ok :)
[02:31:05] <jarco> PlasmaBunny, I am sure you are aware that this has never been done before. And If you would achieve it in any language  it would a breakthrough bigger then man going to the moon.
[02:31:12] <Guddu_> All...is there a way to strip leading Zeros from my quantity input field?
[02:31:13] <postoy> Guddu_: I spent a few months in Argentina and loved it! Though the tea thing and the girls confounded me. Where are you at in Chile?
[02:31:23] <Guddu_> postoy, Santiago
[02:31:38] <seutje> Guddu_: you must pass the thing... whatchamacallit... like the base
[02:31:50] <seutje> Guddu_: it's parsing it as a binary
[02:31:55] <seutje> ?mdn parseint
[02:31:57] <bot-t> seutje, Cara Membuat Slideshow Gambar Ala Yahoo - Blog Ansyari? - Yes - http://blog-ansyari.blogspot.com/2012/03/cara-membuat-slideshow-gambar-ala-yahoo.html
[02:31:58] <postoy> Guddu_ Santiago always reminded me of the city Voltaire wrote about. I've never been there, but geographically it's what I imagine.
[02:32:02] <Guddu_> postoy, Girls confounded you? Why would that be?
[02:32:03] <seutje> bot-t: NO!
[02:32:03] <bot-t> seutje, #10660 (no transport error on Windows Phone 7) ñ jQuery Core ... - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10660
[02:32:12] <seutje> shaddap!
[02:32:25] <postoy> Guddu_: Argentine girls confounded me.
[02:32:32] <seutje> the radix, that's it!
[02:32:34] <seutje> Guddu_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference%2FGlobal_Functions%2FparseInt
[02:32:42] <seutje> should always pass that radix argument
[02:32:50] <seutje> for decimal, use 10
[02:33:32] <Guddu_> seutje, Awesome. Thanks :)
[02:35:13] <Guddu_> seutje, I still get 64...here is what is happening in my case....
[02:35:14] <Guddu_> parseInt(0100,10)
[02:35:15] <Guddu_> 64
[02:35:15] <Guddu_> parseInt('0100',10)
[02:35:15] <Guddu_> 100
[02:37:03] <PlasmaBunny> jarco: well, maybe somebody has ideas about it>
[02:37:58] <Guddu_> Do i need to cast it to string first before doing parseint?
[02:40:22] <seutje> Guddu_: 0100 is already considered a number
[02:40:52] <Guddu_> seutje, But it comes as 64 for me...it is not striping that leading 0
[02:40:57] <seutje> so yeah, I suppose, but where is this coming from? and input field or something, coz then it should probably be returned as a string
[02:40:58] <Guddu_> I tested it in console also
[02:41:11] <Guddu_> seutje, yes. Input field.
[02:42:39] <Guddu_> seutje, Yes...it comes as a string....I just doublechecked. i was confused earlier. Sorry about that. But the radix helped me a lot :) Thanks
[02:43:12] <seutje> Guddu_: hm, hang on
[02:44:26] <techouse> jQuery 1.8.1 already out?
[02:44:47] <techouse> did the fix that nasty SCRIPT5 access denied error with IE?
[02:44:57] <techouse> they*
[02:45:29] <seutje> Guddu_: http://jsfiddle.net/EkbZj/1/
[02:46:26] <xec_> techouse: you can check out the http://blog.jquery.com/ for changelog
[02:46:40] <techouse> will do
[02:46:57] <techouse> that nasty bug required me to load 1.7.2 in ie9 or lower
[02:47:10] <techouse> otherwise it b0rked my js :/
[02:47:26] <Ukto> hey guys.. i created a custom function right before teh $(document).ready(, I can call it from within a .click function inside of the ready... but if I try calling it outside of the click, but right after the ready.. JS shits itself
[02:47:41] <Ukto> any ideas?
[02:49:03] <xec_> ?demo @ Ukto
[02:49:03] <bot-t> Ukto, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:49:09] <techouse> Ukto: function as in function myStuff() {} or $.fn.myStuff = function() {}; ?
[02:49:11] <PlasmaBunny> is there a way to divide by zero in jquery?
[02:49:16] <Ukto> trying to atm
[02:49:25] <Ukto> as in: function () {}
[02:49:32] <Ukto> i have 2 of them. one works fine
[02:49:34] <techouse> PlasmaBunny: u can't  be serious :P
[02:49:34] <xec_> PlasmaBunny--
[02:49:39] <Ukto> doenst havy any argumentws, teh 2nd has 1 arguments
[02:49:47] <Ukto> function blah(id) {}
[02:50:30] <PlasmaBunny> techouse: X / 0 = infinity
[02:50:38] <PlasmaBunny> is it implemented in jquery or maybe some plugin?
[02:50:54] <techouse> PlasmaBunny: no such thing as infinity in computers
[02:51:02] <PlasmaBunny> why?
[02:51:09] <techouse> although there is something like 2^64-1
[02:51:12] <xec_> ?eval 5 / 0
[02:51:15] <bot-t> xec_: Infinity
[02:51:52] <techouse> PlasmaBunny: why not make an infinite while loop?
[02:51:53] <techouse> xD
[02:52:21] <techouse> Ukto: u sure you don't have anything wrong in your functions?
[02:52:37] <techouse> say some var callde before it's defined and stuff
[02:53:41] <Ukto> sigh
[02:53:46] <Guddu_> Thanks seutje ... U helped a lot today. Really appreciate it
[02:53:55] <Ukto> no i foudn the problem, async json call
[02:54:05] <seutje> Guddu_: no problem! so... buy me some food? :$
[02:54:09] <Ukto> json not getting pulled before load always causes a problem. :P
[02:54:24] <techouse> k
[02:54:24] <Guddu_> seutje, I owe you.
[02:54:29] <Ukto> thanks tho
[02:54:42] <Guddu_> :)
[02:55:08] <seutje> Guddu_: like my previous employer!
[02:55:24] <postoy> lol
[02:55:27] <Guddu_> seutje, LOL....no Way.....
[02:56:06] <Guddu_> This reallly comes straight from inside....Its 6 AM here and i was struggling....If it was not for u, i would have carried only till the sun rise....
[02:56:16] <Guddu_> LOL
[02:58:26] <Guddu_> Why do sometimes values show up as NaN
[03:01:07] <postoy> Guddu_: I think this is something to do with JS and not jQuery, but I can't remember. It's late.  Maybe someone else has insight.
[03:02:50] <postoy> Guddu_: If the value is infinite or zero it can show up as Nan I think.
[03:03:14] <Guddu_> postoy, I think the selector is doign something wrong as well... Value is -18
[03:03:34] <seutje> Guddu_: if the first char cannot be parsed as a number, it'll return NaN
[03:03:39] <postoy> I know if you divide a number by zero, it returns NaN.
[03:03:55] <seutje> ?eval parseInt('-18', 10);
[03:03:55] <bot-t> seutje: -18
[03:04:04] <seutje> ?eval parseInt('lolfail-18', 10);
[03:04:05] <bot-t> seutje: NaN
[03:04:27] <PlasmaBunny> ?eval console.log('asd');
[03:04:27] <bot-t> PlasmaBunny: "asd"
[03:04:47] <PlasmaBunny> ?eval while (true) i=i+1;
[03:04:47] <bot-t> PlasmaBunny: ReferenceError: i is not defined
[03:04:52] <PlasmaBunny> ?eval var i=0; while (true) i=i+1;
[03:04:56] <bot-t> PlasmaBunny: No output. (Process Killed)
[03:04:58] <seutje> -_-
[03:05:03] <seutje> no abusing bot-t
[03:05:29] <postoy> lol
[03:06:14] <seutje> if u wanna make infinite loops, use ur own JS console
[03:06:35] <PlasmaBunny> seutje: my hardware is not fast enough
[03:06:46] <postoy> bot-t is too fast.
[03:06:47] <PlasmaBunny> loop is going for too long
[03:07:02] <PlasmaBunny> can somebody remove 'Process Killed' stuff so i could test?
[03:07:08] <Guddu_> I have these 2 lines. The second line is returning NaN sometimes
[03:07:09] * seutje backhands PlasmaBunny
[03:07:09] <Guddu_> var qty = parseInt($(this).find('.quantity').val(),10);
[03:07:09] <Guddu_> 			var inventory = parseInt($parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').html(),10);
[03:07:13] <postoy> Guddu_: what are you trying to get the value from?
[03:07:14] <postoy> ah!
[03:07:44] <postoy> Does .html return a value?
[03:08:03] <Guddu_> And my html is this http://dpaste.org/pUC40/
[03:08:09] <Guddu_> postoy, I will check that now
[03:08:21] <postoy> I didn't think it did.
[03:08:45] <postoy> That might be why you're getting a NaN.
[03:09:04] <Guddu_> console.log($parent.find('.reg_item_inventory').html()) is returning null....
[03:09:37] <postoy> take the text from it and convert it to an integer.
[03:09:56] <postoy> maybe?
[03:10:10] <Guddu_> My function is simple. Not sure why it would return null...my sleector seems to be corrrect. here is my function http://dpaste.org/XmUNw/
[03:10:35] <postoy> instead of .html() try .text()
[03:10:40] <Guddu_> postoy, Checking
[03:10:53] <wingy> could D3 be used instead of jQuery or do they have different functions?
[03:12:24] <Guddu_> postoy, That doe snot work either. If i play around with the input field then it starts giving -18....but when the screen loads for the first time it keeps giving nan. This is dynamically created td rows....may be that's why?
[03:12:44] <postoy> paste bin your JS, I'll try it out.
[03:14:19] <Guddu_> postoy, I can share a EC2 link if that is ok?
[03:14:39] <postoy> sure
[03:20:40] <postoy> Guddu_: you got something wrong with your script.
[03:21:05] <postoy> Guddu_: .text() works just fine for me and then parseInt().
[03:23:47] <tocka> is it possible to change the position of a div element? I mean lets say I have 3 divs and I want to change 1st with 3rd?
[03:25:24] <seutje> var $cont = $('.container'); $cont.find('div').eq(2).appendTo($cont); ?
[03:25:25] <postoy> tocka, tocka, tocka‚Ä¶ yes,
[03:25:43] <seutje> replace $cont with your container element
[03:25:47] <postoy> you can also clone each one.
[03:25:49] <tocka> thanks!
[03:26:14] <tocka> its just I'm using bxslider one div is being added with jQuery, it should be the last slide but now its first
[03:26:46] <postoy> I don't know what bxslider is. Is that some slideshow plugin?
[03:27:14] <tocka> yeah :)
[03:27:17] <tocka> a pretty good one
[03:27:27] <tocka> seutje what does eq(2) do?
[03:27:28] <postoy> For a homepage or a module/widget?
[03:27:36] <postoy> It gets the third element.
[03:27:48] <postoy> It starts at 0.
[03:27:52] <tocka> right :)
[03:27:58] <tocka> yeah its for jiggoshop
[03:28:00] <tocka> jigoshop*
[03:28:16] <seutje> ?eq @ tocka
[03:28:17] <bot-t> tocka, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[03:28:28] <tocka> thanks!
[03:28:29] <postoy> But like seutje explained, the pseudo filters are costly in performance and use regex to traverse.
[03:28:55] <postoy> You might want to do something like ()[2]
[03:30:37] <tocka> this is thingy is going to be at the checkout so I doesn't matter that much
[03:31:51] <postoy> tocka: you are trying to set it to the first element instead of the last, correct?
[03:32:10] <tocka> Im trying to set the first element to be the last one
[03:33:49] <postoy> $('.slide').clone().remove().appendto('.container');
[03:33:54] <postoy> or something like that.
[03:34:41] <postoy> var ele = $('.element').first().clone();
[03:34:59] <postoy> or :first-child
[03:35:14] <postoy> $('.element').first().remove();
[03:35:21] <seutje> doesn't .clone().remove() remove the clone?
[03:35:27] <postoy> $(ele).appendTo('.container');
[03:35:31] <seutje> oh ok :)
[03:35:52] <postoy> Yeah, I'm working against a few vodkas. ;)
[03:36:04] <seutje> lucky bastard
[03:36:05] <majd> i want an function to be executed only once, when the user clicks on an element. should i be doing $("#element").trigger('click', my_function), or $("#element").click(my_function).unbind() ?
[03:36:07] <postoy> lol
[03:36:14] <seutje> I'm working on water and... well, just water rly
[03:36:23] <postoy> try one()
[03:36:30] <postoy> or i think there is once()
[03:36:51] <postoy> or just set your own timer, dude.
[03:36:52] <seutje> once is a plugin that looks like an event binder but secretly isn't
[03:36:59] <seutje> it's very confusing imo
[03:37:05] <postoy> it is.
[03:37:47] <seutje> majd: generally it's better not to unbind (or .off) but change the conditions for execution
[03:38:21] <postoy> seutje: is that because of performance?
[03:38:25] <majd> seutje: hmmm - why so?
[03:38:28] <seutje> yesh
[03:38:35] <seutje> I try find a reference
[03:38:38] <tocka> posty
[03:39:09] <tocka> so I should $(lee).clone().append().remove();
[03:39:09] <tocka> ?
[03:40:00] <seutje> yeah, can't find a reference :/
[03:40:58] <klj613> on a click event handler, how can i get the element which was clicked?
[03:43:08] <klj613> nevermind
[03:51:48] <EnderMB> Hey all. I have some JS attached to a checkbox that will check and uncheck all other checkboxes. It works well, except that it never checks the clicked "all activities" checkbox. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/X9YXe/
[03:52:07] <mazzachre> Is the std. way of finding the form a button is part of $(this).closest('form') ?
[03:52:21] <nVee> hey guys, I need to change the disabled status of another input anytime the an opposite input value is enabled (the input fields works in pairs)
[03:52:27] <caddoo> inside a click handler can you access 2 different versions of 'this'
[03:52:29] <nVee> so if the one is enabled, the other should be disabled
[03:52:40] <caddoo> one for the item clicked, one for the outer model
[03:52:40] <nVee> can anyone assist with a basic idea on how I could approach this
[03:54:09] <mazzachre> nVee: add an event handler?
[03:54:36] <nVee> mazzachre: sorry, i havent done that before, do you have a reference perhaps?
[03:56:43] <mazzachre> nVee: I don't know if there is a std. event, but then you can create handlers that disable/enable and fire these custom events... That way the elements are not strongly bound etc...
[03:56:50] <mazzachre> nVee: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[04:03:47] <sjeijk> he all should this: link = link.replace("&","%26");	replace all & chars in my link or just 1?
[04:09:47] <ablomen> just one
[04:10:20] <sjeijk> is there an fast way to replace m all, or should i just loop
[04:10:55] <ablomen> sjeijk, you can use regex, but if you want to encode an url you can also use encodeURI and encodeURIComponent
[04:11:32] <ablomen> (regex would be /&/g instead of "&")
[04:13:49] <sjeijk> he thanks that encodeURIComponent did it
[04:18:00] <mazzachre> Which is better? Assuming we are currently on a form element... $(this.form).submit(); or $(this).closets('form').submit(); ? Would they both work in all circumstances?
[04:18:49] <postoy> tocka: ignore my first line and follow the rest, I've been drinking.
[04:19:05] <tocka> will do thanks again :)
[04:20:13] <postoy> something like this:
[04:20:14] <postoy> var ele = $('.element').first().clone();
[04:20:15] <postoy> $('.element').first().remove();
[04:20:16] <postoy> $(ele).appendTo('.container');
[04:20:41] <postoy> you might be able to do this by chaining them...
[04:20:50] <mazzachre> postoy: isn't that watch detach is for?
[04:21:28] <faraway> holy crap, i think i need to sell my car and buy a boat to come home -.-
[04:21:32] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance jQuery/Node.j/Qt developer? PM me :)
[04:21:36] <postoy> mazzochre: is that new?
[04:21:55] <mazzachre> postoy.. well as of v1.4 so no...
[04:22:03] <mazzachre> postoy: http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[04:22:19] <postoy> mazzochre: that's kind of new to me. sad face‚Ä¶ :(
[04:22:51] <postoy> tocka: you might be able to use detach instead like mazzochre mentioned.
[04:23:33] <postoy> tocka: it means that you won't have to clone or remove.
[04:23:56] <tocka> I will look into it, thanks a lot guys!
[04:23:57] <postoy> no idea on the performance boost.
[04:23:58] <mazzachre> postoy: It does exactly that, removes the element but keeps all data and handlers attached and returns the element to be attached somewhere else
[04:24:25] <nVee> so is there an .on() "disabled" event or something?
[04:24:42] <postoy> mazzachre: thanks for the insight!
[04:24:51] <postoy> night all!
[04:24:57] <mazzachre> $('.element:first').detach().appendTo('.elsewhere');
[04:25:06] <mazzachre> nite nite
[04:25:15] <mazzachre> (at 13:25)
[04:25:53] <mazzachre> nVee, not that I could find... so you would probably have to do it with custom events
[04:27:44] <postoy> damn. yeah, .detach() makes it so much smoother. okay, i'm out. night.
[04:32:50] <EnderMB> Hey all. I have some JS attached to a checkbox that will check and uncheck all other checkboxes. It works well, except that it never checks the clicked "all activities" checkbox. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/X9YXe/
[04:35:09] <pangelovski> hi guys, I have two buttons on a page for choosing language, how can i pass the button value that was to the next page?
[05:02:44] <rgr> whats the story with clone() and css? Im cloning an element but the positon of the original is absolute bur $("clonedelement").css("position") is evaluating to "", Why is this?
[05:03:09] <rgr> (the clone has the same classes a the original too)
[05:03:37] <mazzachre> rgr: Something that is not attached to the dom does not have a size or position
[05:03:56] <rgr> the template I copy is attached to the dom
[05:04:20] <kzrdt> hi
[05:04:22] <rgr> $("#template").css("position")="absolute"
[05:04:51] <mazzachre> rgr: Yes, but did you attach the cloned element already?
[05:05:06] <rgr> what do you mean "already"? I attached it after I clone the template.
[05:05:35] <rgr> can you explain more please.
[05:07:06] <kzrdt> is there something wrong with this line? "$('.LvlSelectRome1').next('.LevlSelectRome2').removeClass('displaynone');"
[05:07:44] <juha_> kzrdt: depends on what you want to accomplish
[05:07:52] <mazzachre> kzrdt: Not per se.
[05:08:12] <rgr> ?
[05:08:59] <mazzachre> rgr: Hmmm, not sure then... Have you googled it? :)
[05:09:05] <seutje> having a class called "displaynone" seems kinda "wrong" though :P
[05:09:26] <rgr> so how can I clone the css of the original and attach it to the the clone after I attach it?
[05:09:31] <rgr> oh so you dont know?
[05:09:33] <kzrdt> I have many parts of form with these elements and I want individually change the second element on these parts when I change the first element
[05:09:41] <rgr> Yes I did google. And cant find anything.
[05:10:21] <kzrdt> Don't know if it's very clear but... http://pastebin.com/MwmbwwGt here is my code
[05:11:17] <Patabugen_> kzrdt, What's it not doing which you expect it to do?
[05:11:34] <kzrdt> yes, it don't :S
[05:11:42] <kzrdt> does'nt
[05:11:44] <kzrdt> *
[05:11:46] <Patabugen_> It doesn't what?
[05:11:58] <mazzachre> rgr: I can't reproduce your error... Is this what you are doing? http://jsfiddle.net/3jQxY/
[05:12:09] <topriddy> hello good people, i am trying to code jquery for when i have two <select> drop down boxes, in which when one changes, i get new values json from server (through ajax calls). can anyone point me to a sample anywhere please?
[05:12:36] <topriddy> also, if a select triggers a change, how can  i get access to the new value? $(this).value fails
[05:12:55] <kzrdt> Patabugen_: I don't understand your question
[05:12:58] <mazzachre> topriddy: Attach a 'change' handler to select box, do ajax in that
[05:13:23] <Patabugen_> kzrdt: Tell us what you expect to happen which is not happening
[05:13:33] <kzrdt> ah ok
[05:14:13] <topriddy> mazzachre: trying that, dont know how to get  the value when select box changes though
[05:14:16] <topriddy> new value*
[05:14:37] <mazzachre> topriddy: $(this).val()
[05:17:12] <topriddy> mazzachre: okay thanks. would do that now. hope you can show me how to parse json in js.
[05:17:19] <topriddy> would return json from server
[05:17:45] <mazzachre> topriddy: Easiest way is to use $.ajax('dataType: 'json') then the data value in success will be json
[05:18:11] <mazzachre> rgr: Are you cloning something by ID?
[05:19:36] <topriddy> mazzachre: any links to example please? i can parse/learn from code easily. my server has to return json right. thinking of a json array for ease on server
[05:22:19] <mazzachre> topriddy: Just look at the ajax documentation on jquery page, plenty of examples there... it is the easiest thing to do really
[05:24:05] <topriddy> mazzachre: oh cool. would try that. :)
[05:25:10] <kzrdt> it doesn't remove the class on my select with class LevlSelectRome2 which is just after my LvlSelectRome1 select
[05:36:47] <pranavrc> I'm reading a JSON file and assigning its contents into a string inside a getJSON function nested within another function. When I try to return this string from the outer function, it fails. How do I fix this?
[05:37:53] <ravenz> ?demo @ pranavrc
[05:38:11] <pranavrc> sec
[05:38:57] <gym_jane> hi all
[05:39:06] <gym_jane> anyone used W3 Total Cache on wordpress?
[05:39:24] <ravenz> totally off topic
[05:39:32] <ravenz> gym_jane #wordpress
[05:39:37] <gym_jane> i meant to say
[05:39:42] <gym_jane> jquery with*
[05:39:53] <ravenz> what do you mean??
[05:40:27] <gym_jane> basically i loading jquery from Google CDN using a wp_enqueue function and when minify is on it doesn't load at all
[05:40:43] <rgr> whats the best/most efficient jquery approach to selectors to do something like "if this element does not contain a child (not necessarily and immediate child either)  of class X then append an element of class X"?
[05:40:46] <gym_jane> but if i put jquery on my local server and use the same function and minify it is fine
[05:41:22] <ravenz> dunno seems a wp related issue anyway
[05:43:18] <ravenz> rgr var foo = $('#container'); foo.find('.whatever').length && foo.append('<span class="whatever">foo</span>')
[05:43:20] <ravenz> ?
[05:43:47] <alex88> hi guys, i need to set background-color with jquery, does it works the same if i put 555555 or black?
[05:44:30] <ravenz> rgr but I am not sure if it is the best/most efficient approach
[05:44:50] <rgr> yeah, ugly.
[05:44:59] <superlukas> alex88: $('body').css('background-color', 'black');
[05:45:31] <alex88> superlukas, works the same if i set .css('background-color','555555') or do i need #555555?
[05:45:58] <superlukas> i guess you need the hashbang
[05:47:01] <pranavrc> ravenz, http://jsfiddle.net/AkmUq/1/
[05:48:24] <pranavrc> if i alert(randomString) within the getJSON function, it shows 200 fine
[05:48:34] <alex88> superlukas, ok, so i need to find a regex or similar to distinguish the 2 cases
[05:48:38] <superlukas> alex88: http://jsfiddle.net/8EwZm/
[05:48:41] <pranavrc> but the randomString that's returned outside of the function doesn't seem to be 200
[05:48:46] <pranavrc> it returns undefined
[05:48:56] <alex88> superlukas, yeah correct, thanks
[05:50:46] <topriddy> looking at some sample jquery codes, confused with vars named like $name etc
[05:51:18] <ajpiano> ?$prefix @ topriddy
[05:51:22] <ajpiano> damnit
[05:51:46] <Woet> that bot has serious reliability issues
[05:51:47] <ajpiano> it's just a common convention to prefix vars that refer to jquery objects with $, it's not anything special and you can choose to use it or not
[05:51:52] <ajpiano> Woet: we know and are replacing it
[05:51:58] <ajpiano> ...slwoly
[05:51:59] <Woet> the bot or the host?
[05:52:22] <ajpiano> we dont' controlt he bot or the host, someone who used to be active in the community does but he has sort of disappeared
[05:52:27] <ajpiano> so the bot just comes and goes
[05:52:52] <alex88> oh, nice :)
[05:53:04] <Woet> nobody has the source code, ajpiano?
[05:53:20] <ajpiano> nope, aparently it's all AutoHotKey scripting or something
[05:54:08] <Woet> i can take a stab at it
[05:54:15] <Woet> is there a list of definitions somewhere?
[05:54:37] <ajpiano> like i said we already have something in the works, https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot
[05:54:39] <qom2> http://www.danielsachsstiftelse.se/ ‚Äì won't load the images properly in chrome (mac), and not in firefox on a hard refresh either (mac), this is what's causing it I think, but it's needed, how can I work around it? http://pastebin.com/gdL55r2L
[05:55:00] <ajpiano> and there's some very outdated lists, one thing we were planning to do was just scrape the logs to figure out what needs to be there
[06:01:58] <pranavrc> If i type var a = ("#form"), is a bound to the #form value throughout?
[06:02:19] <msch> hi, how do i detect during a mousedown/mousemove/mouseup event series when the user has dragged the cursor outside the browser window?
[06:02:19] <Nomikos> no, you can assign it some other value later
[06:02:28] <pranavrc> because i have an onsubmit attribute in the form, but it seems to be updating the variable whenever i change the input
[06:02:33] <pranavrc> without even clicking submit
[06:07:10] <topriddy> combo boxes seem to post twice on change when i do ajax calls. why?
[06:08:21] <xec_> pranavrc: i assume you meant $("#form") -- if so, what you got is a jquery collection with a reference to the (live) element
[06:08:24] <topriddy> mazzachre: anyone know why ?
[06:11:43] <Palanivel> Hi Hi .........when ever am calling ajax funtion and append the data in the html page in IE 8 is not working..........am seen in developer too html tab there is showing loading that meaning refreshing the page.............so can't able to append the content.................but IE 9 is workin fine............what is the issue??????????
[06:12:11] <Palanivel> any idea
[06:12:14] <Palanivel> ???
[06:14:00] <xec_> Palanivel: no, we need more punctuation to understand what you mean.
[06:14:10] <pachet> yeah that's a code wat
[06:14:12] <pachet> wat
[06:14:12] <b-ot> Boom! Did you are unimpressed? and now?
[06:15:28] <tocka> So I have 3 Divs, is it possible to move the 1st div in down to the bottom of them other 2 divs?
[06:15:46] <Palanivel> simply whenever calling ajax function html page is refreshing.....it's only IE 8
[06:15:49] <tocka> <div1><div2><div3> -> <div2><div3><div1>
[06:15:49] <tocka> ?
[06:16:01] <Palanivel> @xec_simply whenever calling ajax function html page is refreshing.....it's only IE 8
[06:16:23] <alex88> Palanivel, checked for js errors?
[06:16:46] <xec_> Palanivel: calling an ajax function does not refresh a page, even in IE8 - can you show us your code?
[06:16:47] <Palanivel> @xec_............only one error am found in jquery.js file
[06:16:59] <pachet> and that might be your problem, there :[
[06:17:22] <Palanivel> @xec_............object is not found
[06:17:22] <b-ot> Palanivel, memorised ‚Äúxec_............object‚Äù.
[06:17:31] <xec_> sigh

[06:17:50] <Palanivel> @b-ot...........ya ys
[06:18:27] <snover> Palanivel: dude stop leaning on your keyboard
[06:18:51] * alex88 *facepalm*
[06:20:11] <pranavrc> xec_, i'm trying to acquire data from a form, and send it over a bunch of sequential ajax requests. While these requests are being sent, when I type something else in the form, the ajax requests send the new stuff that I've typed.
[06:20:31] <pranavrc> though I'm not reading the form data between the requests
[06:20:37] <pranavrc> only once before the requests are sent
[06:21:22] <pachet> ?paste @pranavrc
[06:21:23] <bot-t> pranavrc, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:21:24] <xec_> pranavrc: you mentioned "sequential"? i take it that means the second request doesn't happen until the first is done?
[06:22:04] <pranavrc> xec, yup
[06:22:10] <pranavrc> i'm not sure how to put that in jsfiddle
[06:22:13] <pranavrc> let me read the docs
[06:22:32] <pranavrc> i'm basically recursively calling the same function within the ajax onsuccess function
[06:22:54] <xec_> pranavrc: so that means form info is gathered, request1 is sent, you edit form, form info is gathered again, request2 is sent
[06:23:22] <xec_> pranavrc: can you spot the error in this pattern?
[06:23:45] <pranavrc> xec_, yeah, but I don't actually get the form data when I send the second request. I get the value of the form in a separate function first, assign it to a global variable, and in every ajax request, I send globalvariable.serialize()
[06:24:02] <pranavrc> that's why i asked if the variable is bound forever to the form data
[06:24:29] <xec_> pranavrc: that's exactly what i answered earlier. what you have in your var is NOT the form data, it is a reference to the LIVE FORM ELEMENT
[06:24:56] <pranavrc> ah, excuse my brain fart :/
[06:24:59] <pranavrc> so how do I fix that?
[06:25:48] <xec_> pranavrc: gather all the actual data you need up front
[06:26:15] <xec_> pranavrc: without knowing the specifics about your form and js, that's all i can say
[06:27:55] <pranavrc> xec, alright, i'll try that, thanks
[06:28:24] <pranavrc> also, i'm having trouble returning a variable modified inside an inner function, from the outer
[06:28:25] <pranavrc> http://jsfiddle.net/AkmUq/1/
[06:29:02] <pranavrc> the variable inside the getJSON function is proper, but it seems to return 'undefined'
[06:29:04] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ pranavrc
[06:29:05] <bot-t> pranavrc, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:29:13] <Nomikos> pranavrc: the alert() code runs before the ajax function has finished
[06:29:35] <Nomikos> ooh, a diagram :)
[06:32:20] <Nomikos> ("Don't feel bad, everybody tries this once" .. hrm. I might have, yess...)
[06:32:35] <pranavrc> alright, i'll put that inside a success function :)
[06:32:37] <pranavrc> thanks!
[06:36:51] <kzrdt> Can i call a jQuery .ajax with arguments? I mean if on a change on a select I want to pass the id of the select and the value of it, how to do it?
[06:37:28] <Nomikos> kzrdt: .ajax has some shortcuts, a nice one is $.post()
[06:37:56] <Nomikos> you can pass it a url, data (objcet), callback and expected return data type
[06:38:06] <Nomikos> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:38:23] <Patabugen_> kzrdt: There may be a more correct way of doing it, but the callback you pass to $.ajax has access to the variables you define just before calling $.ajax
[06:38:24] <Nomikos> there, the id would go in the data object
[06:39:02] <Nomikos> Patabugen_: but that doesn't make them go to the server, which is what I thought he wants
[06:39:09] <Patabugen_> kzrdt, Are you talking about passing parameters to the server for the Ajax request or using them in the callback?
[06:39:34] <Patabugen_> haha Nomikos, I realised after I wrote that we didn't actually know where he wnted them
[06:39:39] <Nomikos> :)
[06:39:48] <kzrdt> Nomikos: Thx I look at it
[06:40:45] <kzrdt> I need to populate a children select after a choice on the first
[06:41:21] <kzrdt> so I think I need to pass parameters to the server
[06:41:29] <Nomikos> hm, dynamic selects are always fun
[06:41:41] <Nomikos> yeah, it's perfectly possible
[06:42:04] <kzrdt> but I also want to hide these children select depending on the action on the parent
[06:42:16] <kzrdt> there is until 4 level of select
[06:42:44] <kzrdt> and they can be added n times to the form...
[06:44:27] <kzrdt> I'm not very goot in js but I think that I can put an event listener on all first select level with a class, get the id and the value chosen, I will be able to populate the direct child select with these infos... no? :S
[06:44:49] <Nomikos> kzrdt: that will work, yes
[06:45:34] <kzrdt> so the jQuery post can do that?
[06:46:53] <Nomikos> kzrdt: yes. if the select changes, you gather the data you want to send to the server, and pass them to the .post() as an object. They'll arrive at the server as POST parameters
[06:47:06] <Nomikos> kzrdt: in PHP that'd be $_POST['id'], for example
[06:47:53] <mweichert> hello! I'm trying to use jquery ui sortable within a lightbox. If the page content is longer than the size of the lightbox, scrolling is required. However, when I'm sorting elements vertically, the page won't scroll down
[06:47:59] <mweichert> any ideas of how to fix?
[06:48:07] <kzrdt> I do that in ajax method with get for my first level
[06:51:14] <karimer> good morning gents
[06:53:57] <topriddy> got an issue with an ajax call i wrote, i keep getting [object Object] back.
[06:58:31] <nFFF> topriddy log it console and see whats in your object
[06:59:18] <Jon47> [object Object] is the toString result of pretty much any object literal
[07:08:02] <sjeijk> Hi All, does anyone know a fast way to generate a pdf using jquery or in combination with php maybe
[07:09:17] <sjeijk> I have to do it with ajax probably cuz most of the data on my page that has to be in the pdf is generated with ajax calls
[07:09:24] <pangelovski> hi guys, If i have two separate html pages, can i execute script on the second page?
[07:09:30] <Nomikos> sjeijk: http://www.tcpdf.org/
[07:09:38] <topriddy> quick one though. after doing something like:$("#zone").change(function(){}); i need to avoid writing $("#zone") again in function when the need to reference arise. $this doesntt work
[07:10:18] <pachet> ?eval ''+({toString:function(){return 'pikachu';}})
[07:10:19] <sjeijk> ever used it Nomikos?
[07:10:20] <bot-t> pachet: "pikachu"
[07:10:41] <Nomikos> topriddy: $(this) should work, and to avoid unnecessary lookups you can do var _this = $(this); first
[07:11:03] <Nomikos> sjeijk: I've used the code on which it was based, fpdf, a Long time ago
[07:11:35] <topriddy> Nomikos: thanks. where can i look up little things like how to cleare a select option box etc
[07:12:23] <Nomikos> topriddy: silly as it sounds, google :-) When I want to figure out how to get the option label from a select, I just google "jquery select option label" and it's usually a stackoverflow question
[07:12:37] <sjeijk> ok thanks Nomikos
[07:12:40] <Nomikos> topriddy: it saves browsing the docs for 15 minutes
[07:18:29] <Guim> Hi Guys!
[07:20:38] <topriddy> NomadJim: quick one please. in "" and '' which is evaluated as is? i.e which can i supply a var inside? like: var sex = "male";  lga.append("sex is sex");
[07:20:40] <pangelovski> is it possible to get which button was clicked in query?
[07:20:49] <topriddy> i want the var to ve evaluated as is
[07:21:25] <ajpiano> topriddy: there isn't string interpolation of vars in javascript, you ahve to break the literal and concatenate
[07:21:45] <topriddy> ajpiano: _lga.append('<option value="">' + data.name ...
[07:21:51] <ajpiano> yep
[07:22:05] <topriddy> ajpiano: apologies for my naive...i have to break the value part too? :'(
[07:22:15] <code_ph0y> hey guys
[07:22:22] <ajpiano> any time you want to insert the value of the var into the string, yes, you need to break the literal
[07:22:29] <topriddy> ajpiano: thanks man
[07:22:48] <code_ph0y> know for the data: param on the $.post call can it be an array?
[07:22:52] <topriddy> ajpiano: doing some jsp code, usually a web framework takes care of all this trouble for me. now have forgotten
[07:22:57] <code_ph0y> like new Array();
[07:24:07] <ajpiano> code_ph0y: no it has to be key value pairs
[07:24:40] <ajpiano> you can send an array in one way by doing like {foo: JSON.stringify( [a, b, c ] );
[07:24:47] <ajpiano> }
[07:24:57] <code_ph0y> like {bla: example}
[07:30:28] <bytephilia> Can you recommend good autosuggest scripts?
[07:42:59] <Nomikos> What's the status quo on jQuery & templates?
[07:43:17] <Guim> Hi, I'm trying to reuse a variable in my code that is actually the number of an array that defines wich background image to show in my carousel, for the first count of the array the script works but as soon as the images start to loop my text stays at my last argument of my array
[07:44:21] <Guim> you can see my development page there, the titles change after the fifth change it doesnt loop http://vultur.ca/project
[07:44:40] <Guim> anyone can tell me what i'm doing wrong? :(
[07:47:05] <johnkpaul> Guim: you have an error on that page if you look at your console
[07:47:11] <johnkpaul> I don't know if it is related, but look into that first
[07:48:56] <Guim> okay I'll look into it, thank you for pointing it out
[07:51:48] <d4ndy> hello
[07:51:50] <d4ndy> i am using $.ajax on a form and while the <input  type="file"> data is coming through, the rest of the fields in my  form are not. any reason why this might be please?
[07:52:29] <d4ndy> here's my call: http://pastebin.com/4RzabKFw
[07:54:21] <Guim> johnkpaul, the error has been looked into, it's unfortunately not related and does not display in the console anymore
[07:54:50] <johnkpaul> Guim: I don't actually see your title change at all
[07:54:59] <johnkpaul> what line of code in what file should be changing your title?
[07:55:28] <Guim> it's on the main page
[07:55:56] <sahbeewah> Guim: you're not modding the indices to your array, and currImg is increasing indefinitely
[07:56:38] <Guim> sahbeewah, though the currImg seemed to be looping correctly displaying the right backgroung?
[07:56:44] <johnkpaul> oh, when you say titles, you don't mean the _page_ title
[07:56:47] <johnkpaul> you mean something else
[07:57:11] <Guim> yes sorry johnkpaul, I'm not fluent english, I meant the header and subheader h1 that display texts change
[07:57:24] <sahbeewah> Guim: that's because you are modding it on the background change
[07:57:47] <bgummadi> while doing count like this $(".MyClass").length, how do I specify a container where it should search? I don't want to search whole DOM for performance reasons
[07:58:27] <johnkpaul> yeah, Guim, sahbeewah is correct
[07:58:36] <johnkpaul> you should be incrementing at the top of changeImg
[07:58:40] <johnkpaul> and modding
[07:58:45] <johnkpaul> and using that throughout
[07:58:55] <NoiseEee> bgummadi: $('#container .class').length;   //see http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[07:59:16] <bgummadi> thanks NoiseEee will check that. appreciate it.
[07:59:27] <NoiseEee> where was that new sizzle doc, hmm
[07:59:54] <NoiseEee> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation
[07:59:59] <Guim> johnkpaul  would you be kind enough to provide me with an example of a correct code? I'm fairly new to jQuery
[08:00:16] <Guim> for incrementing at the right place
[08:01:10] <johnkpaul> it is not a jquery problem, Guim, it's pure JS
[08:02:07] <Guim> yes you're right
[08:02:30] <johnkpaul> Guim: http://jsfiddle.net/BwaFR/
[08:03:39] <Guim> johnkpaul, thank you.
[08:03:47] <johnkpaul> no problem Guim
[08:04:30] <Guim> I've been at it since yesterday, I told myself I could make it work XD you're my hero
[08:09:44] <d4ndy> is it ok to send two data objects via $.ajax?
[08:09:52] <d4ndy> or should i just setup two separate $.ajax calls?
[08:10:10] <johnkpaul> d4ndy: what do you mean two data objects?
[08:11:41] <johnkpaul> d4ndy: if you set your content type to appplication/json, you can send an array of objects
[08:11:50] <d4ndy> mm, sorry, i figured it out, thank you tho :)
[08:26:43] <defaultro_> you guys familiar with this error? "This is most likely due to security restrictions on reading canvass pixel data with local or cross domain images"
[08:29:29] <pachet> defaultro_: yes, it's from EaselJS
[08:29:37] <pachet> are you working with local files?
[08:30:18] <defaultro_> i am not sure where it's coming from
[08:30:27] <defaultro_> it's on a webserver
[08:34:12] <defaultro_> pachet, I do see EaselJS and it's being called from one of the js files. What should I do?
[08:36:54] <pachet> i havent really worked with it enough to give you a super targetted answer
[08:37:06] <pachet> use devtools to try and suss out what context is causing the error, i suppose
[08:37:12] <pachet> context being canvas context
[08:41:21] <zduffy> What would be the proper syntax to nest two change functions with two if statements?
[08:42:56] <seutje> zduffy: sorry, what?
[08:43:04] <zduffy> let me show you an example
[08:44:28] <zduffy> seutje: http://pastebin.com/t91EXd21
[08:45:08] <seutje> zduffy: whoa, yea, binding handlers within handlers is almost always a bad idea
[08:45:48] <zduffy> how can I use two change functions then?
[08:45:56] <johnkpaul> seutje: zduffy sometimes it's necessary, but I would be more explicit in your code if you need to do that
[08:46:17] <johnkpaul> zduffy: you mean you want two change functions to run every time?
[08:46:29] <zduffy> I need both select options to be something, and then display the div
[08:46:40] <zduffy> foo and bar need to be selected before showing the div
[08:47:14] <johnkpaul> zduffy: this is a multiple selection box?
[08:47:44] <zduffy> johnkpaul: two different dropdowns
[08:47:57] <seutje> I'd put a single change handler on both and do my checks in there
[08:48:27] <zduffy> I tried, but the problem is, the second drop down is dynamic based on what the first selection is
[08:49:49] <johnkpaul> zduffy: why does that matter?

[08:49:57] <johnkpaul> that's what seutje is suggesting
[08:50:33] <zduffy> Ok. Makes sense now. I will try that. Thank you both

[08:55:05] <cedrichurst> edge case question‚Ä¶ let's say i have a div that, for whatever reason, looks like this <div class="someClass someClass"/>
[08:55:28] <cedrichurst> is there a way to call $(el).removeClass('someClass') such that both instances of 'someClass' are removed
[08:55:29] <cedrichurst> ?
[08:55:45] <cedrichurst> right now, jq appears to be only removing the first one
[08:56:05] <cedrichurst> i can, of course, do regex with attrs, but that seems sloppier

[09:43:28] <Blubberbob> So I am a little confused here. I am working on a mobile site using jQuery and jQuery mobile. Right now I am having this problem where if a second page opens (by clicking a link, for example), jquery mobile, shows that page, and all of the sudden, jQuery is no longer working. I found that it actually finds elements in the dom, it can modify properties of the dom, say, width.. but if I check that same element in chrome elements list, it still has the old
[09:43:30] <Blubberbob> property value, while a console.log($('#foobar').width()); shows the new value
[09:43:48] <Blubberbob> It is almost as if there is a new DOM tree, and my jQuery is left with an old, not visible, one...
[09:43:53] <slick-> after a click event, i want this to happen jQuery(".station").css({"top": e.offsetY + "px","left": e.offsetX + "px"}).fadeIn(75);
[09:43:59] <Blubberbob> Anybody who might have a clue as to what the heck this is?
[09:43:59] <slick-> but iw ant this to be draggable
[09:44:01] <slick-> not working :(
[09:49:09] <hariom> How to find 'div' element that appears immediately after another element? consider that I have current element in $(this) and I need to find <div> appearing immediately after $(this)
[09:49:45] <gkatsev> .find('div') ?
[09:50:14] <hariom> gkatsev: Will this find the div immediately after $(this)?
[09:50:39] <gkatsev> it'll actually find all divs that are children of $(this)
[09:52:22] <hariom> gkatsev: I don't mean the div is children of $(this). It is something like:  <div id='main'><label>Test <input type='checkbox'/></label><div id='find-it'/></div>
[09:52:57] <gkatsev> and this refers to main? or the label?
[09:53:02] <NoiseEee> hariom: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:53:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $(this > div:first)
[09:54:59] <hariom> ecky--ptang-zoob: are you sure it is $(this > div:first)? I am error - missing )
[09:55:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no, just a guess
[09:55:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> something like that
[09:55:26] <gkatsev> hariom: yeah, .next is probably what you are looking for then, as NoiseEee suggested
[09:55:48] <Blubberbob> Basically, with jQuery mobile, so far, after a second page has been loaded, jquery fails to work because it is working on a DOM that is not visible. There is a page visible, but its not the page jquery is working on, why is this?
[09:58:33] <Guddu> Which tool can i use to see the POST Data when transitioning fro one HTML screen to another?
[09:58:59] <hariom> NoiseEee: It doesn't seem to work
[10:00:05] <astropirate> Guddu, for firefox there is a plugin just type http and you should find it
[10:00:15] <NoiseEee> hariom: fwiw the markup you pasted in channel is missing tags, and you have an <input> within your <label>.... clean up markup, show me a case on jsfiddle.com where its not working.
[10:00:20] <Guddu> Thanks astropirate
[10:01:18] <Guddu> astropirate, HttpFox is it?
[10:01:24] <hariom> NoiseEee: That was just a quick example. and I made a mistake covering input inside label.
[10:01:47] <hariom> NoiseEee: I don't have it in my file.
[10:01:50] <astropirate> Guddu, no... but i cant remember its name. might as well try that one

[10:07:29] <Raydiation> i got this https://pastee.org/sr99q
[10:08:51] <slick-> this should make the object resizable and draggable yes? jQuery(".station").resizable().draggable();
[10:13:46] <tankblergh> hey fellas! I have a problem with ".on() and .bind() in IE. I use them on input fields and they trigger the first time I start typing in them, but only 1 time
[10:13:59] <tankblergh> in Firefox it triggers every time
[10:15:08] <tankblergh> is there a workaround?
[10:18:55] <chovy> anyway to get the css properties of a :hover rule with jQuery?
[10:19:10] <chovy> w/o actually hovering on the target?

[10:32:28] <fourcolors> has anyone be able to use underscore's _.sortBy to sort an array of jQuery objects alphabetically based on one of it's properties?
[10:33:00] <wachpwnski> In terms of table elements, say you have an event that catches a click on a <td> element. How do you select that elements parent table?  Right now I do .parent().parent() but is there a way to do something like .parent(:table)
[10:34:55] <LakWork> $('td.foo').parents('table')
[10:35:12] <LakWork> that will climb up the ancestory until it finds a table
[10:35:21] <wachpwnski> Sweet, thanks LakWork
[10:35:24] <LakWork> np
[10:36:21] <jimbo> wachpwnski you can use closest()
[10:37:37] <Blubberbob> Anybody who can tell me why jquerymobile pageload stops jqyery $('button').on() events?
[10:37:53] <LakWork> jimbo good idea, is that more performant?
[10:38:30] <jimbo> That's a good question LakWork, we can try running it through jsperf and find out
[10:38:49] <jimbo> I know they're both relatively fast
[10:39:10] <LakWork> Blubberbob what's your binding syntax? you'll need to emulate live() with on() bindings in jqm because your page object changes everytime a page load occurs
[10:39:28] <LakWork> it should be $(document).on('click', 'button')
[10:39:55] <LakWork> $(document).on('click', 'button', function() { })   rather
[10:40:42] <slick-> anyone know why draggable is not working with this code http://jsfiddle.net/kQmyT/
[10:41:43] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Im actually using $('parent').on('tap', 'item', functionb(){});
[10:41:48] <Blubberbob> LakWork:
[10:41:53] <LoneStar99> trying to get the following div scrollable --> http://jsfiddle.net/Kw2Ry/1/
[10:42:15] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Just found that if I just use .tap() that it actually works okay.. its the .on that is not working
[10:43:03] <LakWork> what are you using as the parent? is it outside of your current data-role="page" ?
[10:43:32] <jimbo> according to jsperf, closest is about 1% faster than parents
[10:43:43] <LakWork> interesting
[10:43:56] <LakWork> so it's neglible :p
[10:43:59] <jimbo> yep
[10:44:55] <jimbo> i would like to see results from a test done on a large DOM though. That might be a bit more revealing. Probably still negligible though
[10:45:35] <LakWork> the numbers i got from your test case http://jsperf.com/closest-vs-parentsjquery suggest closest is 88% faster
[10:45:42] <LakWork> if i'm reading that right
[10:46:07] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Correction, that now also seems not to work.. I'm going a bit crazy here :( It works fine on first page load, when I click a link, the page slides in place, and all button events are off..  Better even, all jquery selectors seem off, becaues if I in javascript console type $('somediv').css('width', '500px'); it happily shows the <div> with style="width: 500px" while the element navigator in chrome shows that very same div without it and with
[10:46:09] <Blubberbob> width 100px
[10:46:29] <LakWork> jimbo ^
[10:46:37] <Blubberbob> It is as if after the 2nd page load, jquery is stuck with the dom of the previous page, while jquery mobile is showing me the second page...
[10:47:16] <LakWork> hmm that doesnt sound right
[10:47:27] <LakWork> without seeing an example it's kind of hard to debug
[10:47:36] <jimbo> that's interesting
[10:48:07] <Blubberbob> LakWork: one second, let me see if I can popup an example
[10:48:18] <jimbo> 89% slower
[10:48:19] <jimbo> yep
[10:48:24] <jimbo> so use closest
[10:48:29] <LakWork> definitely! wachpwnski
[10:48:52] <jimbo> i was looking at the error margin.... i think i need a break lol
[10:51:59] <LakWork> interestingly, in the scenario wachpwnski described, it looks like the performance gain from closest() is a little less dramatic (47%)
[10:52:03] <LakWork> http://jsperf.com/closest-vs-parents-table
[10:52:27] <LakWork> jsperf is cool jimbo, thanks for showing me it
[10:53:57] <Blubberbob> LakWork: http://m.sven.dnsdynamic.com/
[10:54:05] <Blubberbob> You should be able to open that one
[10:54:21] <Blubberbob> It has some messed up images, but it has the JS
[10:54:43] <subsume> how do I update a particular selector's html every 1 second, regardless of whether it was created via a template or later ajax?
[10:55:01] <Blubberbob> Click the "menu" button, then you see a menu popup.. Click the first link in the menu, it opens the second page, and then suddenly all buttons (menu, back and search) are no longer working
[10:55:54] <LakWork> give me a couple minutes Blubberbob and i'll take a look
[10:56:26] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Would mean a lot, thanks!
[10:56:28] <LakWork> subsum wouldnt a setTimeout() work?
[10:56:48] <LakWork> setInterval() rather
[10:57:17] <subsume> LakWork document.ready(function(){   setTimeout(function(){$("span.timer").html(someval)})} or something?
[10:57:38] <subsume> aka would $("span.timer") bring in this that were created in the DOM later?
[11:03:37] <shahraship> hey guys, i have a question about websockets. It's more of a conceptual question. From a given webpage if we open up a websocket connection, don't we need to close it, when user navigates away from the page?
[11:05:45] <LakWork> shahraship i think this answers your question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812686/closing-websocket-correctly-html5-javascript
[11:06:03] <duck11231> shahraship: are you trying to do cleanup when the websocket closes?
[11:06:57] <shahraship> yes, just thinking that it would be necessary to do so right?
[11:07:05] <LakWork> indeed
[11:07:16] <LakWork> Blubberbob looking at your code, i see you're not using the ON syntax for tap binding
[11:07:52] <LakWork> likewise, you're using an ID selector on your button. because of how jqm works, if you load a new page there will now be two elements with the same ID
[11:08:05] <LakWork> you need to use a class identifier and scope it to the current page
[11:08:36] <LakWork> sorry, no dont scope it to the current page. you want it to be live() so $(document).on('click', '.className', function() { });
[11:08:39] <LakWork> that SHOULD work
[11:09:14] <shahraship> if have two different web pages that require complete datasets, should i open socket connection with two different ports or should I pass different identifiers to the same port socket connection and just load different data from there? or is that even possible?
[11:09:56] <LakWork> that i can't answer, personally
[11:10:56] <duck11231> I don't know about anything that jquery has, but using the GClosure websocket lib, when I navigate away, the close handler is called for me without needing to do anything
[11:11:09] <duck11231> that might just be gclosure
[11:12:30] <shahraship> thanks, I'll look into gclosure
[11:12:33] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Okay, I WAS using .on() actually, exactly because of those reasons.. Maybe the problem is that I am using id's yea, I'll change that..
[11:12:52] <LakWork> ids dont play nice in jqm
[11:13:08] <LakWork> this my jqm site by the way: http://m.scorebig.com
[11:13:45] <duck11231> shahraship: Gclosure is a beast of a library. Just so you know. The only reason I use it is because ClojureScript uses it
[11:14:06] <Blubberbob> LakWork: They might want to add that in cow sized fonts on they doc pages then :) Changing to class names, and retrying..
[11:14:51] <LakWork> you just have to change the way you think with jqm
[11:15:02] <LakWork> every page "load" is really a page append
[11:16:53] <Blubberbob> LakWork: thanks for THAT information, that is clear :)
[11:17:12] <shahraship> duck11231: ya, just saw it's pretty huge. I'll instead just try to implement both ways and see which one works best for me :) thanks
[11:17:13] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Just another detail then, it also means that its *adding* a new menu for every page, right?
[11:19:25] <LakWork> http://imgur.com/a/3Vodd
[11:22:15] <ScottG> Does jquery escape things like the following for malicious html? $('#foo').attr('value', '<some malicious html')
[11:24:31] <LakWork> i dont think so scott
[11:24:32] <LakWork> http://jsfiddle.net/aL3ER/
[11:25:12] <LakWork> i dont know that it's likely to cause a problem though
[11:26:47] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Cautiosly optimistic here, it *seems* to work now..
[11:27:36] <LakWork> yay!
[11:29:05] <Blubberbob> LakWork: Just another quick question.. Since jqm adds all pages.. It would also mean that if I do a $('menu').show(); it would internally show ALL menus from ALL pages, right? If I have 5 pages in memory, it would basically try to show 5 menus (though only 1 would be visible)
[11:29:14] <Blubberbob> Just asking so that I understand how it works
[11:31:59] <stan_man_can> Is there any way to capture the paste event
[11:32:01] <chewbranca> hey any jquery.com people here, looks like the google and microsoft CDN urls aren't uploaded yet: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery
[11:32:18] <chewbranca> specifically https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js is broken
[11:32:20] <stan_man_can> i can use keyup for all typing and control+v pastes, but not mouse pastes
[11:32:24] <chewbranca> and http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.8.1.min.js
[11:34:32] <banderon1> wouldn't something like this work for paste event? $("#temp").live('input paste',function(e){});
[11:35:42] <ravenzz> banderon1 live is old
[11:35:45] <ravenzz> use on()
[11:36:02] <wachpwnski> I noticed in html5 doms they don't always put a starting <head> tag, but they do use a </head> tag
[11:36:05] <banderon1> yep, my code isn't using the latest
[11:36:19] <wachpwnski> Is this correct, or a consistent typo?
[11:36:45] <Justus> hey, how should I go on about toggling the selected attribute of an input type="select"
[11:37:32] <ravenzz> banderon1 anyway paste is the event you are looking for
[11:37:35] <NoiseEee> Justus: $(selectEl).val(valueOfOptionToBeSelected)
[11:37:48] <wachpwnski> Justus: you need catch an event or something. select the element and use .prop or .attr
[11:38:06] <Justus> Ah, misunderstanding, it's allready a caught event, I have the input and all
[11:38:12] <Justus> I just want to toggle the selected value
[11:38:29] <Justus> unset if it's checked check if it's unset
[11:38:46] <ravenzz> wachpwnski the validator would tell you the truth
[11:38:47] <NoiseEee> Justus: what does toggling a selected value of a <select> element mean?
[11:39:03] <Justus> NoiseEee: <input type="select"> not <select>
[11:39:51] <NoiseEee> Justus: i have no idea what crazy markup that is.
[11:40:53] <Justus> NoiseEee: sorry, I meant checkbox
[11:40:55] <TelFiRE> ... Why doesn't this work?? http://jsfiddle.net/ML2vY/ thx in advance... something dumb im sure
[11:42:05] <radify> TelFiRE: there is no next element (I think next is used to refer to siblings)
[11:42:15] <TelFiRE> oh
[11:42:32] <TelFiRE> is there a way to say "the next div.popover in the document" not just inside current object?
[11:42:48] <radify> TelFiRE: $(this).parent().next('div.popover').css('display','block');
[11:42:56] <TelFiRE> fair enough
[11:42:57] <TelFiRE> lol
[11:42:58] <radify> notice the call to parent()
[11:43:00] <TelFiRE> thanks
[11:45:04] <NoiseEee> Justus: something like $(checkbox).checked = !$(checkbox).checked
[11:45:39] <slick-> hey i have to edit this raphael vector file

[11:46:39] <chilversc> slick-: inkscape perhaps?
[11:47:31] <TelFiRE> Is there a way to say, whenever they click outside this element
[11:49:28] <Blubberbob> LakWork_: All works fine, thanks a lot!
[11:49:47] <radify> TelFiRE: you mean when they click anywhere in the doc that is not in the div?
[11:49:57] <TelFiRE> correct
[11:50:09] <summerX> hi
[11:50:17] <TelFiRE> I saw some people suggesting using .not but I'm worried about performance, wouldn't that make a seperate bind for everything on the page
[11:50:24] <summerX> is anyone here heard about PhantomJS and want to help me?
[11:51:34] <TelFiRE> summerX: not that there wouldn't be anyone in here with that knowledge, but you might have more luck in the #phantomjs or #javascript rooms since it's not jquery
[11:51:35] <radify> TelFiRE: I would bind an event to the document and then unbind it after it fires (if you only need it to fire once)
[11:52:20] <TelFiRE> radify: no I am making popovers, they should be able to click the link to bring the popover up then click anywhere to kill it. But would stopPropagation() work and use that method?
[11:52:26] <TelFiRE> gonna try it out, anyway
[11:52:39] <summerX> TelFiRE: i've asked at phantomjs and i'm waiting for their response kinda long. Moreover, it's related to JQuery. I'm trying to use Jquery over PhantomJS
[11:53:33] <ajpiano> summerX: jQuery and PhantomJS are not interchangable things

[11:55:27] <summerX> ajpiano: yup, I know, I use PhantomJS to simulate the browser. I put a simple $.post in Jquery to send post-forms. When i visit the by my browser, the POST is sent, but when i visit it via phantomjs - there is no results
[11:56:19] <ajpiano> summerX: jQuery doesn't provide support for the phantomJS environment.
[11:56:31] <ajpiano> imsky: can you PLEASE just leave your inner monologue out of this channel
[11:57:08] <imsky> lol
[11:57:29] <radify> TelFiRE: http://jsfiddle.net/ML2vY/2/
[11:58:05] <imsky> i get easily irritated if people don't talk about only the things i want, ajpiano, on account of my aspergers
[11:58:49] <TelFiRE> radify: appreciate the help. that one doesn't work for me though :/ at any rate I'm rethinking this because I was just informed they want a hover not a click
[12:00:13] <ajpiano> imsky: i get irritated when i have to repeatedly give people gentle reminders that they are out of line, all the time
[12:00:23] <imsky> you got mad about one line of throwaway text
[12:00:29] <imsky> lol at you
[12:00:36] <ajpiano> it's insane that you think i would judge that in a context free way
[12:00:43] * imsky diagnosis confirmed
[12:02:00] <ajpiano> imsky: i've tried to give you a long leash cause you are helpful sometimes but like, it's just a constant thing
[12:02:11] <ajpiano> i don't know how you expect someone to react
[12:02:11] <bot-t> (5 secs ago) <imsky> tell ajpiano its ok my friend u can achieve zen
[12:02:18] <ajpiano> ok
[12:02:49] <imsky> i dont expect _you_ to react to _my_ single line of text. why would you think i do
[12:03:23] <ajpiano> because you know that i have ASKED you to stop that type of behaviour into the channel, over and over again
[12:03:32] <imsky> adam are you from the uk?
[12:03:37] <imsky> or australia/nz?
[12:03:49] <ajpiano> oh here we go, let's have a discussion about my spelling
[12:04:10] <imsky> lol my frend you woke up on a bad foot today
[12:09:48] <linuxR> hello everyone. hello everyone. I have an effect I don't understand: I have an object having two methods, an ajax request function and an ajax callback handler (the handler being referenced in the request function). When creating an object instance and triggering an ajax request on it, it is executed and the callback function called. However, when I associate the request function to a button click event, the request function is executed but the callback is never
[12:09:48] <linuxR> reached (no error). Can someone provide a little explanation? Thanks
[12:10:51] <johnkpaul> linuxR: any chance you are using "this." in your handler?

[12:11:19] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:11:32] <gnarf> i forget who made that one
[12:11:39] <gnarf> but they were obviously having a bad #jquery day
[12:11:40] <gnarf> :)
[12:12:02] <johnkpaul> ha, yeah, I also feel like fixee.org is new
[12:12:05] <linuxR> johnkpaul, yes I do
[12:12:11] <johnkpaul> I've never seen it before
[12:12:19] <ajpiano> no it's old
[12:12:20] <johnkpaul> linuxR: take a look at the link that ajpiano sent you
[12:12:22] <ajpiano> i love me some fixee
[12:12:29] <johnkpaul> ah, I didn't notice then
[12:14:19] <gnarf> johnkpaul: fixee is alright, the new jsbin is pretty darn hot tho
[12:14:43] <gnarf> still so used to the fiddle interface
[12:15:00] <johnkpaul> yeah, I've started using jsbin a bit, every once in a while when I find jsfiddle too slow
[12:15:55] <linuxR> johnkpaul, ajpiano okay I see the slides but I think I don't entirely understand what's going on :(
[12:16:18] <gnarf> linuxR: then please refer to the "please paste some code"
[12:16:29] <gnarf> oh johnkpaul - i like see ?demo
[12:16:30] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:16:44] <johnkpaul> ah, yes, ?demo is what I usually use
[12:16:55] <johnkpaul> it's funny, I switch between here and ##javascripot
[12:17:02] <johnkpaul> and ecmabot has !code

[12:17:25] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery CDN - provided by (mt) Media Temple - http://code.jquery.com/
[12:18:03] <linuxR> I'll have a look at the slides from the beginning, maybe this helps. will return with code if still unclear :)
[12:18:06] <TelFiRE> Is there a way to target the next instance of a class in the document, regardless of where it is in the tree?
[12:18:19] <ajpiano> linuxR: click handlers, ajax requests, all change what 'this' is
[12:18:30] <ajpiano> somewhere along the line, that is likely what's happening
[12:18:38] <johnkpaul> TelFiRE: next meaning with refernece to an existing jqobject?
[12:18:42] <johnkpaul> ?next @ TelFiRE
[12:18:43] <bot-t> TelFiRE, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[12:18:53] <TelFiRE> No, not the eaxtual next selector, that only selects within the current element
[12:19:05] <gnarf> TelFiRE: thats not a selector
[12:19:14] <TelFiRE> beside the point
[12:19:33] <johnkpaul> hmm, perhaps find TelFiRE?
[12:19:33] <gnarf> are you iterating a collection?
[12:19:50] <gnarf> you can combo two methods together to pull it off TelFiRE
[12:19:52] <gnarf> ?index
[12:19:52] <linuxR> ajpiano, yes I see there is some "magic" going on :)
[12:19:58] <gnarf> damnit bot-t
[12:20:01] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/index
[12:20:09] <gnarf> and http://api.jquery.com/eq
[12:20:14] <TelFiRE> I have <a class="popover"> in the page and I want something to happen to the <div class="popover"> that follows that a. It will sometimes be outside the a's parent, and sometimes inside.
[12:21:16] <gnarf> var popups = $(".popups"); .... popups.eq( popups.index( this ) + 1 );
[12:21:58] <gnarf> TelFiRE: but TBH - that sounds like terrible html ;)
[12:22:07] <TelFiRE> uh no not really
[12:22:08] <gnarf> also
[12:22:13] <gnarf> a should have an href
[12:22:15] <TelFiRE> it's standard, semantic code
[12:22:18] <TelFiRE> it does
[12:22:34] <toddWork> i'm trying understand this design pattern and am getting stuck:   $(window).on('DataModel:success', $.proxy(this.addData, this));
[12:22:42] <gnarf> TelFiRE: index/eq whill do it for you, but its kinda crazy
[12:22:44] <toddWork> soory: here is the link: http://floatleft.com/notebook/backbone-has-made-me-a-better-programmer
[12:22:46] <TelFiRE> gnarf: I think you are imagining something much more complex than what I am doing
[12:23:16] <toddWork> but, how does that proxy function get the data from the AJAX call?
[12:23:23] <gnarf> better would be <a class='popover' data-target='#popover1'> <div id="popover1"> IMO
[12:23:48] <gnarf> but whatevs
[12:24:04] <linuxR> these slides are really neat ajpiano :)
[12:24:20] <gnarf> var popovers = jQuery( ".popover" ); popovers.eq( popovers.index( element ) ); should work
[12:24:34] <gnarf> jsut make sure its a DOMElement, not a jQuery that you pass into index
[12:24:42] <gnarf> also, +1
[12:25:09] <gnarf> jQuery returns selections in "document order"
[12:26:08] <toddWork> here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dsT8f/1/
[12:26:22] <toddWork> when you hit that button, i wans to see the twitter json but data isn't making it there.
[12:27:45] <gnarf> um toddWork because you have debug=false ?
[12:28:18] <gnarf> oh nvm
[12:28:20] <gnarf> sry
[12:29:08] <toddWork> clearly i'm missing something and i think it's in OutPut.prototype.bindEvents
[12:29:27] <toddWork> how do i get that attached data off of 'DataModel:success'
[12:29:40] <gnarf> toddWork: yeah, function args are event, data not data
[12:29:45] <gnarf> so your logging the event
[12:29:48] <gnarf> not the data
[12:31:57] <toddWork> gnarf: how do i get the data?
[12:32:02] <gnarf> its the second param
[12:32:06] <toddWork> oh.
[12:32:08] <gnarf> to the event handler
[12:32:15] <gnarf> event is the first param
[12:32:15] <johnkpaul> toddWork: http://jsfiddle.net/dsT8f/3/
[12:32:19] <toddWork> got it!
[12:32:40] <toddWork> thank you gnarf , johnkpaul
[12:32:54] <gnarf> toddWork: i'd suggest using a second function though
[12:33:03] <gnarf> "addData( event, data )" is a bad method name
[12:33:42] <toddWork> gnarf: ok give me a minute and i'll refactor
[12:33:44] <gnarf> rename, or bounce it through something like OutPut.prototype.dataHandler = function ( event, data ) { return this.addData( data ) ; };
[12:34:10] <gnarf> or even, when binding
[12:34:27] <gnarf> bind to $.proxy(function( event, data ) { this.addData( data ); }, this)
[12:34:37] <gnarf> prolly the quick/short/easy way
[12:35:54] <gnarf> toddWork: +1 on using a : tho
[12:35:54] <johnkpaul> I wish that there was a syntactically light weight way to mess with arguments in js
[12:36:08] <gnarf> johnkpaul: you can write that
[12:36:12] <gnarf> johnkpaul: curry/etc
[12:36:27] <johnkpaul> oh, sure, it's flexibile enough that we can write everything on our own
[12:36:46] <johnkpaul> but it's not like pythons *args[1:]
[12:37:04] <johnkpaul> I've had a fairly pythonic day today is all
[12:39:38] <toddWork> http://jsfiddle.net/dsT8f/4/
[12:39:52] <gnarf> johnkpaul: _.compose( function(_,a){return a}, _.bind(this.addData, this) )
[12:40:05] <toddWork> the purpose of dataHandle is to deal w/ that event param?
[12:40:24] <gnarf> toddWork: i'd just annonymize it, its just chomping the event param anyway
[12:40:27] <Flam9> I'm struggling with binding events to dynamic markup.   For example "$('.navBar > a').live('mouseover', function() {...});" works, but "$('#tabs').on('mouseover', '.navBar > a', function" does not
[12:40:36] <johnkpaul> gnarf: ah, interesting, I have never used _.compose
[12:40:37] <gnarf> toddWork: but yes
[12:40:40] <Flam9> Does anyone know if I'm missing something for my "on" to work?
[12:40:44] <johnkpaul> not completely lightweight, but very useful
[12:40:51] <toddWork> gnarf: that event param came form .on() ?
[12:41:06] <toddWork> *From
[12:41:10] <gnarf> toddWork: yes, all event handlers take an event as their first param
[12:41:38] <johnkpaul> Flam9: you're sure that .navBar > a are children of #tabs?
[12:41:44] <eph3meral> (function(foo, bar, baz) { ‚Ä¶ }(document, 'script', 'mysdk'));
[12:41:49] <eph3meral> what's up with that syntax?
[12:41:55] <eph3meral> and or what's it called or where can I read about it?
[12:41:58] <gnarf> eph3meral: IIFE
[12:42:01] <gnarf> ?iife
[12:42:01] <bot-t> Immediately Invoked Function Expression: http://bit.ly/js-iife
[12:42:02] <Flam9> they are.  I think I solved it by replacing "#tabs" with "document"
[12:42:06] <Flam9> I guess tabs is dynamic itself
[12:42:07] <eph3meral> ok cool thanks
[12:42:15] <Flam9> (I'm using jquery ui)
[12:42:20] <eph3meral> gnarf++
[12:42:26] <linuxR> okay, could someone look at my example and explain why this does not work: http://pastebin.com/hCrz9qmh
[12:42:52] <toddWork> ok. thanks gnarf
[12:42:58] <Heather_> whats the best to user between $.post() / $.ajax() ?
[12:43:06] <johnkpaul> linuxR: because you are using "this" in methodA
[12:43:30] <linuxR> john-dev, what would be a solution to this problem?
[12:43:35] <johnkpaul> linuxR: http://jsfiddle.net/xWUc5/
[12:43:37] <gnarf> johnkpaul: compose is pretty awesome
[12:44:06] <gnarf> johnkpaul: you should watch johnbender's talk from SF - he kinda covers how amazing it can be
[12:44:12] <johnkpaul> gnarf: yeah, it's a nice utility, always surprised with things in _ that I don't know
[12:44:25] <johnkpaul> gnarf: oh yeah, I did when I was there, I didn't know _ had it available
[12:44:25] <ravenzz> gnarf is that on youtube?
[12:44:37] <gnarf> ravenzz: yeah - all the talk videos are up now
[12:44:54] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: http://confreaks.com/videos/1009-jqcon2012-faster-jquery-with-category-theory
[12:45:27] <ravenzz> thanks
[12:45:30] <gnarf> ravenzz: what johnkpaul said - but i was gonna say you could find a link on http://facebook.com/jquery :)
[12:45:37] <linuxR> johnkpaul, I mean sorry john-dev
[12:45:49] <gnarf> i remember someone posted that there
[12:46:05] <johnkpaul> linuxR: take a look at the fiddle that I sent you
[12:47:38] <ravenzz> oh wow just 122 likes, that is cool
[12:47:41] <linuxR> johnkpaul, what does that proxy do? can this be explained in simple words? :/
[12:48:00] <johnkpaul> linuxR: sure, it overrides what "this" means inside a function
[12:48:12] <johnkpaul> ?proxy @ linuxR
[12:48:13] <bot-t> linuxR, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:48:13] <johnkpaul> for more info
[12:49:14] <gnarf> ravenzz: there is another jquery page before jquery made an official page
[12:49:20] <gnarf> ravenzz: we need more likes :)
[12:49:25] <linuxR> thanks johnkpaul  that is very interesting. would I have the same problem with "plain" javascript w/o jquery?
[12:49:38] <johnkpaul> linuxR: yes, but you wouldn't have a nice $.proxy to help fix it
[12:49:53] <johnkpaul> you'd have to write something custom unless you don't need to worry about IE < 8
[12:50:58] <linuxR> johnkpaul, is there a simple way to determine the "this" context at runtime?
[12:51:24] <ravenzz> gnarf it is a good thing to have few followers / likes in these cases in my opinion. It means more effort from the curator on publishing good content
[12:51:48] <ravenzz> what do you need the likes for anyway
[12:51:51] <johnkpaul> linuxR: what do you mean determine?
[12:52:01] <johnkpaul> this === myObj //true?
[12:53:31] <KWhat_Work> Is there a way to track event delivery?  I am loosing an event somewhere and I cant seem to figure out why.
[12:53:55] <johnkpaul> KWhat_Work: delivery?
[12:54:03] <johnkpaul> perhaps http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/chrome-developer-tools-monitorevents
[12:54:11] <dorgan> ok so quick question I am using  .bin() inside of a loop and I need to pass some data to the bind event...the problem is the data that i need to pass is inside arrays and I am using the loopIndex to reference the data, so when the event gets triggered it passing in the data from the last element to all the items listening to that event
[12:54:12] <linuxR> johnkpaul, maybe it's possible to make it somehow "visible"? return the actual function or something like that?
[12:54:27] <KWhat_Work> thanks ill give it a look
[12:54:40] <johnkpaul> linuxR: sorry, I don't understand what you mean
[12:55:14] <johnkpaul> this is a keyword in javascript that has a fair bit of complexity attached to it
[12:55:21] <johnkpaul> it would be worthwhile to learn though
[12:56:04] <ravenzz> what is the advantage of using proxy against apply or call?
[12:56:15] <johnkpaul> linuxR: http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
[12:56:21] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: apply or call actually invokes the function
[12:56:28] <linuxR> thanks johnkpaul   I'll read some more about that. I wonder however if this "proxy" solution is considered good programming practice
[12:56:30] <johnkpaul> proxy just binds it to a context for future execution
[12:56:32] <ravenzz> proxy bind^?
[12:56:36] <ravenzz> ok
[12:58:09] <johnkpaul> linuxR: yes, it is a best practice to bind functions to contexts, there are other methods, besides $.proxy, but you have jQuery available, and it has this utility available for you to use
[12:58:12] <ravenzz> so why not bind() ?
[12:58:34] <johnkpaul> I can't think of any way to effectively write complex programs in js without the ability to override the context of functions
[12:58:46] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: $.bind or FUnction.prototype.bind?
[12:58:53] <ravenzz> the latter
[12:59:16] <ravenzz> Function.prototype.bind
[12:59:36] <ravenzz> does it conflict with $.bind ?
[12:59:47] <johnkpaul> yes, so ravenzz, that would work too, but it is unavailable in IE<=8
[12:59:53] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: no, it does not conflict
[13:00:25] <ravenzz> ah yes of course
[13:00:28] <ravenzz> that shit
[13:01:31] <linuxR> okay johnkpaul , thanks for all the help and explanations! I'm going to think about 'this' now :)
[13:01:32] <ravenzz> why isn't jquery adding it to the Function prototype then?
[13:01:47] <astropirate> ravenzz, it is
[13:01:55] <astropirate> $.fn = jQuery.prototype
[13:01:56] <ravenzz> I mean, the fallback
[13:02:04] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: $.proxy has some extra features that Function.prototype.bind does not have
[13:02:08] <johnkpaul> ?proxy @ ravenzz
[13:02:08] <bot-t> ravenzz, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[13:02:46] <ravenzz> if (Function.prototype.bind !== "function")  { /* add it (what proxy does actually)*/ }
[13:03:25] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: you're free to write that into your own app
[13:03:32] <johnkpaul> it might be better just to use the es5 shim
[13:03:44] <ravenzz> no well I am not complaining about that
[13:03:47] <ravenzz> I am just curious
[13:04:23] <johnkpaul> ah, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's because $.proxy does more than bind
[13:04:31] <johnkpaul> but perhaps there are more reasons
[13:06:30] <ravenzz> okk
[13:08:02] <linuxR> oh I have another small question: registering a callback function (e.g. in ajax call :  "success: this.handleResponse", ...  how can I pass arguments to that function as well? this.handleResponse() executes the function which is not what I want...
[13:08:04] <Heather_> can someone help me understand the "bridge" between php and js. How do I send back a json encoded php variable? Through die(); in php?
[13:09:24] <ak> Heather_: echo out some json string
[13:09:43] <ravenzz> Heather_ echo json_encode($yourArray); exit;
[13:09:48] <ak> maybe use the json_encode function
[13:09:53] <Heather_> I do
[13:10:24] <ravenzz> so what is your question about?
[13:10:39] <jrockjiggz> need moar info
[13:10:51] <Heather_> the echo part. Did not know that going to try brb
[13:12:07] <ravenzz> moar beer
[13:13:29] <johnkpaul> linuxR: you can actually use $.proxy for that too
[13:13:47] <johnkpaul> $.proxy(func, context, arg1, arg2, arg3)
[13:14:08] <linuxR> I really start liking this proxy thing :)
[13:14:50] <monstordh> how do i check to see if an img is a specific filename?
[13:15:32] <MistuhKurtz> I don't see anything about passing arguments with proxy johnkpaul ?
[13:17:56] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: hmm, you mean in the docs?
[13:18:00] <MistuhKurtz> correct
[13:18:15] <johnkpaul> hm, I didn't realize this was undocumented behavior
[13:18:23] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone have a preferred plugin to convert a <select> into a dropdown with every option having a checkbox?  Having trouble working with dropdowncheckbox.
[13:18:28] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.proxy
[13:20:04] <jrockjiggz> FunnyLookinHat: google turned up: http://www.1stwebdesigns.com/blog/development/multiple-select-with-checkboxes-and-jquery
[13:20:18] <FunnyLookinHat> thanks jrist
[13:20:19] <FunnyLookinHat> err
[13:20:21] <FunnyLookinHat> jrockjiggz,
[13:20:24] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah, I wouldn't use undocumented behavior johnkpaul
[13:20:41] <jrockjiggz> FunnyLookinHat: seems to be a textview, not dropdown -=/
[13:20:41] <johnkpaul> yeah, I didn't realize that it was undocumented until now
[13:20:48] <Heather_> ravenzz is the json_encoded array saved to data in function(data) ?
[13:20:48] <johnkpaul> I wonder why it's not
[13:21:06] <ravenzz> Heather_ if everything went fine, yes
[13:21:09] <NexHD> hi look at this please and verify is any of } this missing in that code? i cant find the error
[13:21:12] <Heather_> kk
[13:21:13] <NexHD> http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/8gPXD/
[13:21:25] <silverwind> jQuery proxy is well documented
[13:21:29] <MistuhKurtz> I'm curious as to what other solution could work for linuxR johnkpaul
[13:21:30] <aleminio> hey guys
[13:21:41] <jrockjiggz> FunnyLookinHat: i also found: http://code.google.com/p/dropdown-check-list/
[13:21:44] <silverwind> Some people here take bad drugs
[13:21:48] <johnkpaul> MistuhKurtz: you could just write that arguments juggling behavior yourself
[13:21:57] <FunnyLookinHat> jrockjiggz, Yeah that's what I'm currently trying to get to work...
[13:22:00] <johnkpaul> silverwind: yes, it is well documented, but there is a feature of $.proxy taht isn't documented
[13:22:05] <aleminio> Is there a way to find the absolute position of an element compared to 2 different parents?
[13:22:07] <FunnyLookinHat> I'm having some issues with layers and styling ti seems.
[13:22:22] <LoneStar99> how would i replace text in <div id="foo">replace text</div> ??
[13:22:48] <ravenzz> ?position @ aleminio
[13:22:58] <ravenzz> aleminio http://api.jquery.com/position/
[13:23:02] <aleminio> it gets me the position of the first parent
[13:23:21] <ravenzz> use some logic then
[13:23:34] <ravenzz> parent offset - element offset ?
[13:23:36] <jrockjiggz> FunnyLookinHat: url i can look
[13:23:43] <FunnyLookinHat> local test for now  :-/
[13:23:51] <FunnyLookinHat> Thanks though
[13:23:56] <NexHD> can someone help me?
[13:23:56] <LoneStar99> .replaceWith ...
[13:24:01] <denelius> i have a file upload function $('#fileupload').fileupload({});  i would like to bind to a button element returned from an ajax call any assistance much appreciated
[13:24:49] <slitch> hi
[13:24:58] <jrockjiggz> add , before focus:
[13:25:20] <jrockjiggz> NexHD: focus: is missing , before:    }, focus:
[13:25:28] <slitch> Can someone tell me why the spinner ui isn't downloadable from the main website?
[13:25:48] <jrockjiggz> NexHD: and remove }; because you are still inside obj
[13:26:05] <jrockjiggz> NextHD: http://jsfiddle.net/8gPXD/1/
[13:27:58] <jrockjiggz> denelius: you'd need to find the event name that fileupload() uses, and $('button').bind('fileuploadevent') or something.. its hard to say without given proper information
[13:28:16] <slitch> Can someone tell me why the spinner ui isn't downloadable from the main website?
[13:28:29] <rgr> is there a jquery shortcut to centering an absolute div relative to the parent if you dont know width of the div you wish to center?
[13:28:49] <arielserafini> um
[13:28:54] <jrockjiggz> rgr, no
[13:29:25] <arielserafini> can't you just get the width dinamically?
[13:30:02] <jrockjiggz> rgr: can be done with css though, http://css-tricks.com/centering-in-the-unknown/
[13:30:04] <agu10^> hey!
[13:30:25] <rgr> I can do anything, but thats not what I'm asking;) Im asking if jquery has something. I found a fex functions to achieve it though.
[13:30:35] <denelius> jrockjiggz: thanks for response - as a static element on page i currently have <input id="fileupload" type="file" name="files[]" value="upload image" data-url="uload/server/php/index.php" multiple> and it works as it should however i need a second element to be returned by ajax to bind to that same function
[13:31:32] <agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com.ar/
[13:31:34] <jrockjiggz> denelius: just an idea.. but you can $('newElement').click( function( $('#fileupload').trigger('click'); });
[13:31:44] <agu10^> I need to emulate the clicking of "spanish" in the translate toolbar
[13:31:47] <agu10^> using jquery
[13:31:50] <ravenzz> data-url="uload/server/php/index.php" you are doing something wrong
[13:32:10] <denelius> jrockjiggz: thank you I will give that a try
[13:32:13] <slitch> Can someone tell me why the spinner ui isn't downloadable from the main website please?
[13:32:18] <ravenzz> agu10^ http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[13:32:41] <agu10^> ravenzz, i don't know exactly what to emulate
[13:32:52] <agu10^> how can I "inspect" what events are really being raised?
[13:32:54] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: posting your website isn't helpful to me. if you want, ask for example, or post a segment of your code
[13:33:13] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, don't you see the translate toolbar on top?
[13:33:37] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: sure do.
[13:33:46] <agu10^> ok
[13:33:46] <ravenzz> ah you are using google translate
[13:33:59] <agu10^> well I just want to hack it so that users don't know I'm using the toolbar
[13:34:18] <agu10^> just want to emulate the clicking of the dropdown option (or maybe just call the google methods myself)
[13:34:25] <agu10^> and just hide the google bar
[13:34:28] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: $('#google_translate_element').hide();
[13:34:33] <agu10^> I did that
[13:34:47] <agu10^> but that doesn't help unless I choose the option to translate, manually
[13:34:48] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: but its on spanish by default
[13:34:57] <agu10^> nope. it's english by default.
[13:35:03] <MistuhKurtz> agu10^, google translate has an API
[13:35:04] <agu10^> you HAVE to click on it to change it
[13:35:05] <agu10^> right?
[13:35:11] <agu10^> MistuhKurtz, not anymore
[13:35:17] <MistuhKurtz> agu10^, I'm using it on a site
[13:35:32] <ravenzz> agu10^ but even if you select it by hand it doesn't work
[13:35:38] <agu10^> MistuhKurtz, what API? I read of one that's no longer working since december 2011
[13:35:42] <ravenzz> and google's translate api are not free
[13:35:46] <agu10^> ravenzz, it does for me
[13:35:46] <jrockjiggz> denelius: you may need to use on(), as click() wouldn't bind to the element because it doesnt exist yet.
[13:35:51] <MistuhKurtz> https://developers.google.com/translate/
[13:36:11] <ravenzz> only the widget
[13:36:12] <agu10^> ahh that explains it
[13:36:18] <MistuhKurtz> It says it's a paid API...but I think if you have a low-traffic site it doesnt' matter
[13:36:27] <agu10^> well I'm ripping off google services (?)
[13:36:33] <MistuhKurtz> We're using it on a site without paying, heh.
[13:36:38] <MistuhKurtz> no, you're not.
[13:36:39] <agu10^> MistuhKurtz, that makes sense
[13:36:43] <ravenzz> MistuhKurtz you need an api key
[13:36:52] <denelius> jrockjiggz: thanks I was looking at the on() but struggling with the correct syntax
[13:37:02] <ravenzz> they are still supporting the old one, which will be putted offline iirc
[13:37:17] <agu10^> maybe because you built the website when it was free, MistuhKurtz
[13:37:24] <agu10^> you now have an API key
[13:37:29] <MistuhKurtz> I didn't build the website
[13:37:32] <MistuhKurtz> I don't have an API key
[13:37:38] <agu10^> ah I don't want mine to be put offline soon...
[13:37:45] <agu10^> I just want to hack google's free one.
[13:37:45] <MistuhKurtz> a client just asked me to set up a translate plugin on their wordpress site and it just worked
[13:37:46] <MistuhKurtz> heh
[13:37:50] <jrockjiggz> slitch: this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m6/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[13:38:06] <ravenzz> MistuhKurtz that is the old API
[13:38:18] <grantg> Kill the IE hax with fire: http://i.imgur.com/vsYgD.jpg
[13:38:21] <MistuhKurtz> but I agree I don't think it's a good idea to not use something documented
[13:38:22] <agu10^> "Is there any free quota?
[13:38:23] <agu10^> No, the Google Translate API is only available as a paid service. Please see Pricing and Support for more details. However we do offer the Google Website Translator gadget, which will translate your website without charge."
[13:38:30] <jrockjiggz> google translate is no longer free
[13:38:41] <ravenzz> noone is free anymore
[13:38:50] <jrockjiggz> facebook isss
[13:38:51] <slitch> Can someone tell me why the spinner ui isn't downloadable from the main website please?
[13:38:58] <jrockjiggz> slitch: this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m6/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[13:39:00] <jrockjiggz> slitch: this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m6/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[13:39:01] <ravenzz> maybe some unknown services can provide it, but I don't know one
[13:39:02] <jrockjiggz> slitch: this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m6/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[13:39:15] <ravenzz> jrockjiggz I think he got it :D
[13:39:20] <agu10^> "Google Translate API v1 is no longer available as of December 1, 2011 and has been replaced by Google Translate API v2. Google Translate API v1 was officially deprecated on May 26, 2011. The decision to deprecate the API and replace it with the paid service was made due to the substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse."
[13:39:39] <slitch> thank you :)
[13:40:12] <agu10^> OMG, google killed this website :(
[13:40:12] <jrockjiggz> microsoft translator: http://www.microsofttranslator.com/dev/
[13:40:18] <agu10^> http://translationparty.com/
[13:40:24] <MistuhKurtz> http://www.microsoft.com/web/post/using-the-free-bing-translation-apis
[13:40:28] <MistuhKurtz> there's also MS/Bing
[13:40:38] <agu10^> ^ It used to use google translate API v1 to convert between english and japanese, and back.
[13:40:41] <agu10^> it was really fun
[13:40:42] <jrockjiggz> or you can just, pay for google translate
[13:40:56] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, not an option
[13:41:42] <MistuhKurtz> Translation Party works for me agu10^
[13:41:44] <agu10^> microsoft's is limited to a few characters or something.
[13:42:05] <agu10^> oh it works
[13:42:26] <agu10^> just not from my chrome session
[13:43:00] <agu10^> anyways, how can I hack google's toolbar to hide it and yet make it translate my page?
[13:43:36] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: use the function,
[13:43:56] <ravenzz> agu10^ I don't remember how does it works, and the thing is that your website has only one language (spanish) which is the default
[13:44:02] <jrockjiggz> GoogleTranslate('en')
[13:44:30] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, does that work with the toolbar?
[13:44:45] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: you dont need the toolbar, remove or hide it
[13:45:00] <agu10^> I mean does that work with the widget?
[13:45:12] <jrockjiggz> tias
[13:45:47] <agu10^> Uncaught ReferenceError: GoogleTranslate is not defined
[13:46:57] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: see step 1 http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466251-how-to-install-google-translate-tool-to-translate-disqus-comments
[13:50:03] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, I already had step 1...
[13:50:57] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, I do not know what you're trying to say. I already have the widget. It does NOT automatically translate. I have to manually make it translate...
[13:51:48] <agu10^> which means I have to click on the dropdown and select spanish. Which I don't want the user to do. I need to emulate that so that the user doesn't have to do anything!
[13:54:05] <agu10^> OHHH, translation party moved to Microsoft Translator!!!
[13:57:33] <Xtreme> hey guys, is there any way to get a <input> by name attribute?
[13:57:48] <Xtreme> similar to ("#id").val()
[13:58:51] <jrockjiggz> $('input[name=piano]')
[14:07:47] <jacta> Can anyone help me?
[14:08:05] <arielserafini> that depends, what are you having problems with?
[14:08:28] <arielserafini> it's better to just ask your question directly :)
[14:09:52] <Nomikos> I'm looking at the docs for the UI datepicker widget; $('#datefield').datepicker( "option" , options ) -- Set multiple datepicker options at once by providing an options object.
[14:10:18] <Nomikos> but that simply doesn't work - if I only pass the options object, it does. Am I reading this wrong?
[14:11:18] <shoky> Nomikos: you can set an option like that only after you've already initialized with a call to .datepicker() or .datepicker(options)
[14:11:36] <shoky> er oh i misread
[14:11:37] <jacta> arielserafini, http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/RPFMh/3/ I have this right now - and when its on last element go back to 0 again
[14:12:01] <jacta> I can say some more if its not understandable :)
[14:12:57] <jacta> if a span is height=17 - i want foreach 50ms top go be current top height - 17 more - so its like "scrolling" them in the overflow box
[14:13:26] <Nomikos> shoky: it confused me, the syntax examples all just pass the object, too
[14:14:25] <shoky> Nomikos: seems to be working for me..
[14:14:30] <Nomikos> shoky: I'd just filed a bug report on .sortable() the other day which uses similar syntax, was wondering if that was just a doc error too for a bit..
[14:14:43] <Nomikos> hrm. I'll try other browsers in jsfiddle
[14:14:48] <shoky> Nomikos: how exactly are you calling it?
[14:15:01] <shoky> and did you already initialize it before
[14:15:12] <shoky> oh, share the fiddle..
[14:15:29] <Heather_> if I return a json from php to the callback function is data an array in js? And I extract the dataitems like data['somekey'] ?
[14:16:36] <jrockjiggz> data is string, you would convert it to json
[14:17:45] <jrockjiggz> Heather_: jQuery.parseJSON(data)
[14:18:06] <Heather_> okay save it to a variable and I have my array
[14:18:36] <jrockjiggz> yup, you should read http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:19:08] <ekpyrotic> Guys, I have a single button that submits two forms (using the same action) with $.ajax.
[14:19:08] <Nomikos> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/CbFAn/
[14:19:40] <ekpyrotic> Can I easily integrate the validator plugin to check those two forms before it submits them?
[14:19:43] <shoky> Nomikos: right, you didn't initialize the datepicker on #datum2
[14:20:14] <Nomikos> I .. didn't?
[14:20:48] <shoky> Nomikos: nope
[14:21:08] <Nomikos> shoky: when I take out the first param 'option' of the $('#datum').datepicker line, it works
[14:21:28] <Nomikos> how is it not initialized?
[14:22:09] <Nomikos> This is initializing: $('#datum2').datepicker(_options); but this is not? $('#datum2').datepicker('option', _options);
[14:22:19] <Sicp> anybody know anyone in #sysadmin?
[14:22:32] <agu10^> how can I find all <font lang='us'> ?
[14:22:47] <shoky> Nomikos: lets first load the proper jqui css - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CbFAn/1/
[14:22:55] <agu10^> $("font lang=us") ??
[14:22:56] <shoky> it was getting a 403
[14:23:28] <Nomikos> odd, it worked for me, but that was FF vs Chrome I guess
[14:24:09] <shoky> Nomikos: and now lets initialize it before setting its options: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CbFAn/2/
[14:24:27] <agu10^> sorry, how can I find EVERY element with the parameter lang='es' ??
[14:25:05] <shoky> agu10^: $('[lang=es]')
[14:26:09] <Nomikos> ok. that's not confusing at all or anything :-p
[14:26:19] <shoky> not to me ;p
[14:26:21] <agu10^> great!
[14:26:35] <agu10^> shoky, if i wanted only font elements with lang=es?
[14:26:39] <shoky> Nomikos: you can only call methods (such as 'option') on UI widgets _after_ they've been initialized
[14:26:39] <Nomikos> so object in initialization works, but ('option', object) only works after initial init
[14:27:53] <shoky> agu10^: $('font[lang=es]')
[14:28:12] <Nomikos> shoky: did I mess up here as well or is this legitimately wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/Knhnd/2/
[14:28:19] <ekpyrotic> From earlier: Guys, I have a single button that submits two forms (using the same action) with $.ajax. Can I easily integrate the validator plugin to check those two forms before it submits them?
[14:30:05] <agu10^> suppoes I have <div parent> <font lang='es'> heello </font> <img blabal /> </div> and I want to end up with <div parent> heello <img blabal /> </div>, which means, eliminate all <font lang='es'> but KEEP the inner text. How would I go about it?
[14:34:25] <shoky> Nomikos: yea it looks like a potential bug
[14:34:46] <shoky> as far as i can tell, at least..
[14:34:59] <Nomikos> shoky: thanks for checking
[14:35:11] <jrockjiggz> agu10^: var fontEl = $('font[lang=es]'); var fontText = fontEl.text();  fontEl.replace(fontText);
[14:36:01] <agu10^> ahhh thanks!
[14:36:14] <agu10^> .replace was the key
[14:38:52] <ekpyrotic> In particular, here's my current script: http://pastebin.com/3pLuiQDs
[14:39:15] <ekpyrotic> The defined vars come from w/in two different html form tags.
[14:40:04] <ekpyrotic> And I want to integrate the validator plugin to validate these defined fields.
[14:41:19] <agu10^> jrockjiggz, Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLFontElement> has no method 'replace'
[14:44:58] <mikepj> ekpyrotic: you'd be better off putting the form values in a json object, running that through a validator and then using it for the data property in the ajax call
[14:48:40] <shoky> agu10^: try .replaceWith
[14:49:18] <shoky> though that would only work good if you only had one such <font>
[14:49:42] <ekpyrotic> mikepj, thanks, also realised the jQuery validator plugin has a .form() method that returns false if not valid.
[14:50:13] <shoky> agu10^ for multiple ones you'd need sometjhing like:  $('font[lang=es]').replaceWith( function() { return $(this).text() } );
[14:50:26] <wachpwnski> I'm trying to catch an event on a selector that is generated with google apis.  I tried live, it still isn't catching it.
[14:50:30] <shoky> just go with that its shorter anyway ;P
[14:51:08] <timeturner> anyone
[14:51:10] <timeturner> here
[14:51:12] <agu10^> nice
[14:53:15] <agu10^> shoky, http://potentialstudio.com.ar/ -> this translates my page to spanish. I want to REMOVE the text highlights when the cursor is on top of a translated text. Any ideas?
[14:53:32] <agu10^> removing the attribute lang='es' does not help.
[14:53:58] <agu10^> I bet the microsoft script has a variable where it saves each element or has events on them. what can I do?
[15:05:01] <ogk1000> is it possible to make a loader percentage bar for a page.. like in flash?

[15:20:40] <bung> Clex: i thought so too
[15:20:49] <johnkpaul> Clex: no, mobile browsers make a distinction
[15:21:01] <rythmic> Clex, it doesn't respond so I guess no
[15:21:02] <johnkpaul> and they all have slightly different definitions, especially if you have a hover event
[15:21:05] <Clex> How do you click with an Ipad then?
[15:21:15] <johnkpaul> you tap and hold for a specific amount of time
[15:21:21] <johnkpaul> there are many events
[15:21:35] <johnkpaul> touchstart, touchend, touchmove, click, mouseover, mouseout
[15:21:37] <halim> oi, a little question about ajax: do $.post and $.get call the global ajax events (like ajaxSuccess) too?
[15:21:49] <bung> ? post @ bung
[15:21:49] <bot-t> bung, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[15:21:59] <bung> success is in there
[15:22:14] <johnkpaul> halim: yes, they do call the global ajax events
[15:22:21] <agu10^> how can I trick microsoft to think I speak another language?
[15:22:24] <johnkpaul> post and get are just wrappers around $.ajax
[15:22:26] <agu10^> it will ALWAYS translate to spanish
[15:22:27] <agu10^> wtf
[15:22:28] <halim> thank you, johnkpaul
[15:22:31] <agu10^> even if I use a proxy
[15:22:32] <johnkpaul> halim: np, have fun
[15:22:50] <johnkpaul> agu10^: http://www.bing.com/worldwide.aspx ?
[15:23:07] <agu10^> i'm not using bing.
[15:23:27] <bung> agu10^: microsoft what
[15:23:29] <agu10^> i'm using bing translation for my own website
[15:23:29] <johnkpaul> :) I don't know, just a suggestion
[15:23:45] <rythmic> johnkpaul, is there a more like out of the box way. I tried to use on touchend, but on is not supported until 1.7
[15:23:48] <agu10^> so I just want to test if it gets translated ok to... say... german?
[15:24:20] <johnkpaul> rythmic: you mean is there an out of the box way of supporting an event that was not made until after your version of jquery was released?
[15:24:29] <johnkpaul> that's almost not possible by deifnition :)
[15:24:45] <bung> agu10^: http://translate.google.com/m
[15:24:54] <agu10^> lol
[15:24:55] <bung> you can put a web address there and change "English" to whatever
[15:25:08] <agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com.ar
[15:25:24] <bung> http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_m&sl=auto&tl=de&twu=1&u=http://potentialstudio.com.ar/
[15:25:27] <agu10^> I want to know if that ^ gets trasnlated to german BY ITSELF
[15:25:29] <johnkpaul> rythmic: you can .bind('touchstart', handler')
[15:25:29] <rythmic> johnkpaul, :) that's not what I meant. What I meant was is there a way to catch a touchend event without resorting to some little js "hack" while using jquery 1.6
[15:25:37] <bung> you mean if someone was in germany?
[15:25:41] <agu10^> yes exactly
[15:25:47] <johnkpaul> rythmic: ah, yes, you can bind directly
[15:25:54] <bung> agu10^: what happens when you go to a german website
[15:25:55] <agu10^> but even if I use a proxy, it will translate to spanish ony
[15:26:11] <bung> because your computer is set to spanish right?
[15:26:11] <agu10^> to a german website? i see that website... ??
[15:26:20] <agu10^> no. it's english.
[15:26:26] <agu10^> my chrome is set to english also.
[15:26:39] <agu10^> so I do not know where it gets my 'spanish' from
[15:27:08] <bung> im pretty sure people in germany will be asked by chrome if they want to translate your site to german
[15:27:15] <rythmic> bind worked :)
[15:27:30] <johnkpaul> :) great rythmic
[15:27:44] <bung> a proxy wouldnt work because translate alert is not ip based
[15:27:59] <rythmic> johnkpaul, I went with touchend though as that feels closer to an onclick event
[15:28:12] <johnkpaul> yeah
[15:28:26] <johnkpaul> rythmic: http://sitr.us/2011/07/28/how-mobile-safari-emulates-mouse-events.html
[15:28:29] <johnkpaul> ^ @bung Clex
[15:29:48] <Clex> Sorry johnkpaul, I try to act like if Apple were never born.
[15:30:11] <johnkpaul> Clex: ha, then don't y ou worry about touch events until you come across an _Google_ android user
[15:30:29] <agu10^> bung, I do not want translate alert. i don't know what you're talking about
[15:30:39] <agu10^> my website translates automatically by itself!
[15:30:53] <agu10^> I want to know if it works for germany too
[15:30:53] <bung> agu10^: then your browser is f'd up
[15:31:04] <agu10^> nope. I do not need help from any browser.
[15:31:12] <agu10^> MY WEBSITE DOES IT.
[15:31:29] <rythmic> johnkpaul, nice reference, Got diigoed
[15:31:36] <bung> agu10^: by php or something?
[15:31:44] <johnkpaul> rythmic: diigoed?
[15:31:49] <agu10^> microsoft's gadget
[15:32:03] <agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com.ar
[15:32:05] <bung> is that the name of a program "microsoft's gadget" ?
[15:32:29] <johnkpaul> bung: http://www.microsofttranslator.com/
[15:32:30] <rythmic> johnkpaul, my bookmarkcollector. like google bookmarks or similar
[15:32:35] <johnkpaul> so it is bing, agu10^ :)
[15:32:43] <johnkpaul> ah, I see rythmic
[15:32:49] <agu10^> yes it is, in the background.
[15:32:54] <agu10^> but it is not bing.com
[15:33:20] <agu10^> it's microsoft translate gadget.
[15:33:43] <agu10^> i do not care about what happens when i enter my url in bing translate, at all.
[15:34:04] <johnkpaul> agu10^: this is #jquery, I don't think we have any idea
[15:34:15] <johnkpaul> perhaps there is a support email for bing translate?
[15:34:24] <rythmic> it's past midnight here so I'm off to bed now. I can now achieve my dev goal for the weekend really easily thanks to this new insight :)
[15:34:25] <agu10^> ah
[15:34:36] <johnkpaul> rythmic: no problem, have a good night
[15:34:52] <agu10^> I use a german proxy and it STILL translates to spanish :(
[15:35:56] <bung> agu10^: i doubt its ip based
[15:35:58] <johnkpaul> agu10^: http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/is/translator/thread/daa3774d-68c2-4bd6-ba6f-ea6ec53fadfc
[15:36:02] <bung> why would a translator ever be ip based
[15:36:02] <johnkpaul> Accept-Language header
[15:38:04] <agu10^> bung, google is IP based
[15:38:07] <agu10^> microsoft is too
[15:38:13] <agu10^> they all change language based on IP.
[15:38:24] <defaultro> the person I interviewed today was so-so although his resume was so decorated, lol
[15:38:45] <agu10^> well at least google.com changes its language based solely on IP.
[15:41:21] <acxty> Hi guys. I want to parse a search from google into my page. Is it possible to do it only with JQUERY or do I need a server side script ?
[15:43:49] <bung> acxty: should be able to
[15:44:19] <LessSeen> yea jquery should be enough
[15:44:19] <johnkpaul> acxty: not necessarily anything to do with jquery, but http://code.google.com/p/google-api-javascript-client/wiki/Samples#CustomSearch_API
[15:44:28] <johnkpaul> you have to pay $ for anything more than 100 requests though
[15:45:05] <acxty> johnkpaul: I want to use maps.google.com/maps and return the search into javacript
[15:45:47] <acxty> johnkpaul: I already try with .get and .ajax but doesn't return anything
[15:46:12] <johnkpaul> acxty: you need to use the google maps javascript api
[15:46:17] <johnkpaul> ?g google maps javascript sdk
[15:46:18] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Maps JavaScript API v3 - Google Developers - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
[15:47:07] <defaultro> i'll ask again, is someone really skill in jquery/javascript and ok on php that is willing to apply for a job in Chicago?
[15:47:19] <defaultro> really skilled
[15:47:34] <defaultro> i have the power to refer
[15:48:18] <johnkpaul> defaultro: ask in #css-lance
[15:48:31] <defaultro> ok
[15:48:32] <johnkpaul> the chances of you finding someone here is very slim and that's not what this channel is for
[15:48:40] <defaultro> ok
[15:49:33] <defaultro> i just posted there
[15:49:45] <defaultro> the person will be working with me :)
[15:50:21] <LessSeen> good luck defaultro :)
[15:50:43] <defaultro> it's ok if I won't find one
[15:53:07] <acxty> johnkpaul: Is there a way to get the html generated but any webpage?
[16:04:36] <defaultro> just posted it in meetup.com about the job i mentioned here
[16:15:18] <Fernandos> hi
[16:16:38] <Fernandos> Is there an ETA for the new jQuery Plugin Repository?
[16:18:07] <Fernandos> I wondered how the admin managed to oversee the fame jQuery got through the Repo
[16:20:05] <Fernandos> Are there plans to develop a YUI or Google like Plugin API and CDN Network? Would be awesome to see that coming before jQuery 2.0
[16:23:05] <Fernandos> Even a rather simple UI like jsfiddle.net with versioning would suffice to ressurect the Plugin Repo... grrr
[16:53:08] <wachpwnski> how do you return an ajax respose as a string?
[16:53:25] <wachpwnski> If i do alert(data) it will return the string
[16:53:46] <wachpwnski> But if I do var r = $.ajax and return data
[16:53:51] <defaultro> no
[16:53:52] <wachpwnski> r becomes an object not a string
[16:54:13] <defaultro> read ajax on api.jquery.com, very good example
[16:54:29] <defaultro> search for ajax function then search for success:
[16:54:44] <defaultro> success: function(theresponse) {}
[16:54:46] <defaultro> something like that
[16:55:07] <defaultro> then you can play with the variable theresponse
[16:55:13] <defaultro> you can name it whatever you like
[16:56:23] <defaultro> $.ajax({
[16:56:23] <defaultro>   url: 'ajax/test.html',
[16:56:23] <defaultro>   success: function(data) {
[16:56:23] <defaultro>     $('.result').html(data);
[16:56:23] <defaultro>     alert('Load was performed.');
[16:56:24] <defaultro>   }
[16:56:26] <defaultro> });
[16:56:49] <defaultro> data gets populated with the result from retrieving test.html
[16:57:40] <NexHD> how i add regex to a input with .match ?
[17:02:32] <NexHD> is somebody here
[17:02:33] <NexHD> ?
[17:06:44] <wachpwnski> defaultro: I am using it to populate a google api table draw
[17:07:07] <wachpwnski> it returns nothing
[17:09:28] <defaultro> then your file is doing wrong
[17:09:36] <defaultro> exclude google first then troubleshooting
[17:09:40] <defaultro> use firebug
[17:09:48] <defaultro> it's all there, response, post, etc
[17:26:53] <wachpwnski> defaultro:  how do you use jquery.ajax on jsfiddle?
[17:27:15] <defaultro> i haven't tried but I guess it hsould work
[17:27:21] <defaultro> choose jquery on left column
[17:51:35] <Heather_> whats the best approach/function to use if I want an icon to show depending on a php variable just since a page laods before the javascript loads right?
[17:56:45] <jrockjiggz> Heather_: what
[17:57:15] <jrockjiggz> page loads before javascript loads yes
[17:57:28] <jrockjiggz> load image as html
[17:57:36] <jrockjiggz> remove image with jquery when dom is ready
[17:57:42] <jrockjiggz> $('#preloadImg').remove();
[18:00:23] <Heather_> ok ty
[18:20:13] <Heather_> if I have a php controller file with switch case statement that looks for a variable. How do I pass an action when e.g clicking image. like $.post('index.php?action=action'); the request is passed when I look in firebug.
[18:20:40] <Heather_> but it does not do what its supposed to (carry out certain statements)
[18:23:29] <astropirate> Heather_, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/   look at the "data" variable
[18:23:49] <astropirate> a key-value object with your post data
[18:26:29] <Heather_> yehah I've tried seperating the query string like $.post('index.php', '?action=makeunanonymous');
[18:26:55] <Heather_> but that looks correct to you?
[18:28:06] <arielserafini> Heather_, you need to pass an object, not a string
[18:28:11] <arielserafini> with your parameters
[18:28:39] <arielserafini> (I just joined, so I have no idea what your problem is or what you said before that)
[18:28:55] <Heather_> I see
[18:29:14] <Heather_> so I have to user get
[18:29:17] <Heather_> use*
[18:29:30] <arielserafini> $.post('index.php', {action: "makeunanonymous"});
[18:29:59] <arielserafini> no, you don't
[18:30:05] <arielserafini> that will work with post
[18:33:51] <Heather_> yeah your right object literals I rem.
[18:35:39] <wachpwnski> Why does this ajax request not populate my rows? http://jsfiddle.net/sh5hF/1/
[18:35:44] <arielserafini> Heather_, did it work?
[18:38:53] <aJacom[ghost]> Weird. I'm not getting anything on ie9 with animate({ left:"+=30"},1000);
[18:39:02] <aJacom[ghost]> any clues ?
[18:44:38] <Heather_> question: does a phhp variable persist when send to a page and then used in a ajax request?
[18:44:57] <Heather_> or do I have to send a new js variable?
[18:49:42] <aJacom> anyone's had trouble with .animate() on IE9 ?
[18:52:39] <arielserafini> aJacom, can you post your code on a jsfiddle?
[18:58:41] <aJacom> arielserafini, http://jsfiddle.net/9uxzT/
[19:01:01] <aJacom> alright.. uhm. works on the jsfiddle & not on the localhost file
[19:03:44] <arielserafini> aJacom, yeah, it runs perfectly for me
[19:03:59] <arielserafini> probably something else is interferring?
[19:04:54] <aJacom> wow chrome doesn't render it either. i'm just double clicking the file. only FF works. you can see my code there.. can you think of any reason why that wouldn't work from file:// ?
[19:05:57] <arielserafini> not at first glance, no
[19:06:20] <arielserafini> but if you run jslint (on jsfiddle) there are a few things to fix/improve
[19:06:26] <arielserafini> maybe you could try that
[19:06:41] <arielserafini> i honestly don't know that that would solve your problem
[19:07:02] <arielserafini> BUT file:// is not very reliable for testing anyway
[19:08:24] <aJacom> i know chrome has a thing with file:// and LESS, but who knows. maybe with jQuery as well .
[19:08:51] <aJacom> tyhx
[19:08:59] <aJacom> *thnx
[19:09:22] <arielserafini> did you try the jsling thing?
[19:11:16] <arielserafini> jslint*
[19:49:04] <defaultro> hey guys, there is a function that saves the information. interface.changes.submit(); I can see the response in json format in Firebug. I need one of the fields. Any ideas how I can grab the info?
[19:49:28] <rev_icon> The function returns JSON?
[19:49:52] <defaultro> i don't konw where this function is defined but I can see the output in firebug and format is in json
[19:50:19] <rev_icon> ‚Ä¶ is it doing an AJAX submit to a server, is that where you're seeing it in firebug?
[19:50:38] <defaultro> i am not sure if it's an ajax call but definitely it connects to the server
[19:50:52] <defaultro> let me step into it
[19:51:09] <defaultro> it's minified code
[19:55:10] <djshotglass> is $('select').onchange(function(){$('input[name="select_page"]').click();}); the same as is $('select').onchange($('input[name="select_page"]').click);
[19:56:21] <defaultro> i didn't see any $.ajax code
[20:00:13] <arielserafini> no, djshotglass, it's not
[20:01:27] <arielserafini> djshotglass,  well, that might work actually. have you tried it?
[20:05:36] <Peter_lee> I'm using this token input plugin http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/ but it's not working in ie8 or Safari OS 5.1. What is the best way to test cross browser?
[20:06:33] <Jester831> rawr
[20:54:20] <NexHD> somebody here ?
[21:09:02] <astropirate> NexHD, no
[21:09:46] <rev_icon> nobody here but us chickens
[21:10:30] <gkatsev> a cow-orker of mine made hubot in hipchat spit out random pictures of chickens whenever someone says checkin
[21:11:12] <rev_icon> hadn't heard of hip chat before
[21:11:37] <rev_icon> is it better than just straight irc?  checking out it's website now
[21:11:59] <gkatsev> well, it's private chat
[21:12:09] <gkatsev> so, you'd use it for your company
[21:12:39] <rev_icon> at my last company we just ran an IRC server, I guess this is a hosted solution.
[21:12:53] <gkatsev> yeah, it's similar to it
[21:13:08] <gkatsev> I guess this has more GUI oriented features?
[21:13:18] <gkatsev> also, it comes with a webclient
[21:13:24] <rev_icon> got it
[21:14:12] <astropirate> ohh I had to use that
[21:14:14] <astropirate> its rather nice
[21:14:21] <astropirate> if you can shell out the $$
[21:31:07] <bung> anyone here ever do anything like cascade an args object down functions
[21:31:22] <bung> pros/cons
[21:31:31] <bung> just curious if im doing something insanely stupid lol
[21:31:41] <astropirate_> bung, what do you mean
[21:31:46] <bung> adding to my data as i go through logic
[21:31:55] <bung> and passing it down different function calls based on logic
[21:32:23] <bung> i guess it will be hard to describe without a huge code sample
[21:32:31] <astropirate_> aye
[21:32:36] <bung> sry m8 :)
[21:33:12] * bung tries to decide if its worth the 10minutes to type a sample
[21:33:14] <bung> hmmm
[21:38:29] <bung> astropirate_: maybe something like this http://pastebin.com/9wk8njGP
[21:38:50] <bung> where privateMethod() might actually need more of the data from args and so I piggy back for free the args object i already have
[21:39:05] <bung> rather than calling it with some new {...} data object
[21:39:40] <bung> it seems intuitive to me
[21:40:24] <astropirate_> bung, ohh, i dont know if you know this, but objects are passed by refrence in JS
[21:40:46] <astropirate_> when you pass them to another function, you are passing a refrence. the data doesnt' get copied to a memory location
[21:40:59] <bung> thats fine
[21:41:05] <bung> thats eactly what im using
[21:41:30] <astropirate_> ohh i thought you were micro-optomizing as to not copy data. ok ignore my last statement
[21:41:31] <bung> im passing by reference something that exists already, adding to it if i need
[21:41:38] <bung> no worries
[21:41:52] <bung> ive got the logic there, but no real good use-case so its still not a great example
[21:42:32] <astropirate_> bung, i wouldnt do it that way. but i see no roblem with that
[21:43:23] <astropirate_> var bool = true;     args.bool = bool;  is redundent :p
[21:43:47] <bung> here maybe this is better http://pastebin.com/ayievEib
[21:44:07] <bung> well lets say var bool = true:false depends on some other logic
[21:44:10] <bung> i know it looks stupid as it is
[21:44:25] <bung> so here privateMethod gets $a for free
[21:44:55] <astropirate_> what do you mean for free?
[21:45:22] <bung> well i dont have to call privateMethod({ $a: args.$a, bool: bool});
[21:45:38] <bung> which again sounds retarded, but i dont have to create a new 'args' variable
[21:45:45] <bung> thats what im thinking is nice about it
[21:46:00] <bung> whenever you call a function( args ), you usually create a new args object for it
[21:46:17] <bung> but when you have something like this that just digs down some functions, you can just pass it on through to all
[21:46:26] <bung> sorry man, i guess im tired and drunk and not making sense
[21:46:47] <bung> weeee
[21:46:58] <bung> i owe you 5minutes of your life back
[21:47:03] <coldhead> what kind of voodoo is this
[21:47:06] <bung> xD
[21:47:23] <astropirate_> lolol
[21:47:29] <coldhead> you are way past the ballmer peak, bung
[21:47:42] <bung> ?g ballmer peak @ bung
[21:47:43] <bot-t> bung, xkcd: Ballmer Peak - http://xkcd.com/323/
[21:47:54] <bung> ouch.
[21:48:01] <bung> is it that bad?
[21:49:27] <bung> i think i forgot to put jQuery into my anon-space, oh well whatever
[21:49:31] <bung> i should get back to work
[22:00:29] <LoneStar99> what you all recommend for autocomplete from php/ mysql backend?
[22:01:56] <rev_icon> jqueryUI's autocomplete works pretty well from the client side.  Assuming you're asking from that perspective
[22:04:37] <Lucky|Dev> I was watching a MSDN lecture on Channel9 with their head of the web division. Nobody seemed to notice, but when he was showing slides and web pages, it was with chrome :-)
[22:07:44] <LoneStar99> rev_icon: yeap strictly front-end
[22:08:11] <rev_icon> LoneStar99:   http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[22:09:34] <LoneStar99> jqueryUI is different not included in jquery core codebase?
[22:10:08] <rev_icon> correct.  it's a UI library that relies on the query core.
[22:10:45] <rev_icon> *jquery core
[22:11:56] <LoneStar99> rev_icon: ok thanks
[22:13:53] <bung> is it possible to change $('a[class*="sid_"]') to $anchor.hasClass() if you're only getting one anchor object at a time
[22:18:19] <bung> ah-ha

[23:08:40] <coldhead> http://t.co/SlFvC16C
[23:09:46] <versatiletech> coldhead: this yours?
[23:10:06] <coldhead> some of it is mine!
[23:10:13] <coldhead> not the butterfly
[23:10:41] <versatiletech> looks interesting
[23:11:48] <versatiletech> I'm looking at the JS. So it's just changin the background-position?
[23:12:20] <coldhead> yes, all the fancy stuff is in the css
[23:12:36] <versatiletech> yeah I'm looking at that
[23:13:46] <versatiletech> man all of it looks tedious
[23:14:27] <versatiletech> did they use math to come up with all of the degrees? I would bang my head if I had to do this by hand.
[23:16:45] <coldhead> its generated from about 100 lines of SASS
[23:17:04] <versatiletech> Oh! now that's a whole lot more manageable
[23:19:52] <versatiletech> coldhead: how much SASS have you worked with?
[23:19:58] <coldhead> this is my first time
[23:20:07] <coldhead> i suck at it
[23:20:12] <versatiletech> cool. I've been reading up on it.
[23:20:57] <versatiletech> been doing it the old fashion way for too long, I need an upgrade
[23:27:22] <wilornel> Is someone here?
[23:28:38] <versatiletech> I don't know
[23:29:00] <versatiletech> ? ask
[23:29:00] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:30:31] <wilornel> how to manipulate a google maps map?
[23:31:00] <wilornel> It is a class, right? So there should be a "variable" to which I can execute functions, right?
[23:31:41] <gloomer> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/
[23:32:37] <versatiletech> Thanks gloomer. wilornel: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/wiki/jquery_ui_map_v_3_tutorial
[23:43:09] <LoneStar99> anyone have a good link for styling jquery autocomplete?
[23:43:53] <gloomer> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[23:45:27] <LoneStar99> thank you sir!
[23:45:38] <gloomer> nces
[23:45:42] <gloomer> ur welcome
[23:47:31] <LoneStar99> gloomer: what if i just want to make something simple changes to autocomplete behavior myself?
[23:48:00] <gloomer> jquery.autocomplete.css
[23:48:12] <gloomer> just edit it there
[23:48:51] <versatiletech> LoneStar99: behaviour or styling?
[23:51:16] <LoneStar99> styling
[23:53:06] <LoneStar99> versatiletech: styling
[23:56:08] <pneftali> hi all - do you know any data-table plugin that has this kind of feature: http://pcx.com.ph/accessories/cpu-fans.html?mode=list ... basically it has two options to display data, in list or grid view...
[23:57:06] <versatiletech> LoneStar99: ok yeah then what gloomer said. Sometimes your autocomplete css is compiled into a giant ui theme css file. You could just override the CSS in a new css file.
[23:57:37] <LoneStar99> oh ok
[23:57:40] <LoneStar99> thanks
