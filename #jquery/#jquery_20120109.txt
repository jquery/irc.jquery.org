[00:00:01] <lc3> it's always .val()
[00:00:42] <raj> ah ok, thank you
[00:00:46] <raj> that explains that
[00:01:08] <lc3> awesome
[00:01:21] <lc3> hey are you any good at debugging ajax stupidity?
[00:01:35] <lc3> i mean i know it's something i have screwed up somewhere
[00:02:12] <raj> sure I'll take a look, but I'm not so great
[00:02:15] <lc3> the mystery is: works in chromium locally, doesn't work in chromium on the live site, doesn't work in any other browser i've tried on either
[00:03:29] <raj> what's your backend?
[00:04:24] <lc3> raj: a hand-rolled django app, if you mean what's running on the server
[00:04:36] <raj> yeah
[00:04:53] <lc3> here's the weird thing: it's meant to be posting an XHR to /questions/ask/ajax/
[00:05:16] <lc3> chromium on the live site and firefox, randomly decide to GET /questions/
[00:05:34] <raj> can you see your data using console?
[00:05:39] <lc3> yup
[00:05:55] <lc3> it's just randomly GETing an unrelated page which i don't understand :(
[00:05:59] <raj> so what happens?
[00:06:19] <raj> you have to stop the submission from POST/GET
[00:06:25] <raj> e.preventDefault
[00:06:55] <raj> e.preventDefault()
[00:07:05] <raj> if you show me some code, I can tell you where perhaps
[00:08:25] <lc3> raj: i tried that just now
[00:08:33] <lc3> i show you!
[00:09:01] <lc3> http://nickhird.com/questions/
[00:09:16] <lc3> (i only maintain it, i'm not nick hird :P)
[00:09:44] <nVee> hey guys, using $.post(), I am getting a list of banners from a server. I need to use that list (array) outside of the $.post() function, how do I do that?
[00:10:22] <lc3> shove it into a global like a real man
[00:10:42] <raj> under $("#ask_form").submit(
[00:10:49] <raj> and before the function
[00:10:53] <raj> i think
[00:11:05] <lc3> raj: just tried that locally, no dice
[00:11:29] <lc3> function(e) {  e.preventDefault();
[00:12:14] <lc3> but the thing is, the original form doesn't even post to /questions/, it posts to /questions/ask/ (and is set to /questions/ask/ajax/ by jquery)
[00:12:27] <lc3> so why the shit it's deciding to get /questions/ is beyond me
[00:17:08] <aple> How can you save $.each data into an array?
[00:17:50] <Cork> ?.map @ aple
[00:17:50] <bot-t> aple, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[00:18:15] <Cork> bah
[00:18:19] <Cork> ?jquery.map @ aple
[00:18:19] <bot-t> aple, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[00:19:54] <aple> Thanks
[00:21:34] <lc3> raj: now do you see why i am confused? :)
[00:29:40] <aple> Crap. I'm dying here. Anyone know how to iterate over  a list of anchors and put each <a> value as a class for it's container <li>?
[00:30:19] <aple> So for instance, I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/LGnm7/
[00:30:35] <aple> And I want to put all the values of the <a>'s as a class within their respective <li> containers.
[00:30:54] <aple> So the first <li> would be <li class="red apple">
[00:31:14] <MagePsycho> guys can you help me iin finding best infinite scroll jquery pagination?
[00:31:29] <lc3> aple: sec
[00:31:59] <aple> lc3: Thanks man. Been working on this filtering thing for hours now. Sucks being a newb. :)
[00:32:45] <mindis|wurk> hai. i was wondering how i should approach the following: i have an array where i store data for my buttons which i generate in a loop. i also add a click event for the buttons using the corresponding data as parameters for the function the click calls. but if i use something like button.click( function(){myfunction(myvalues[i]);}); it keeps using the last index for every button when calling myfunction
[00:36:29] <lc3> aple: blugh, this is straightforward, i'm a noob too
[00:36:54] <nisseni> I'm trying to search for a "saving animation" - but not sure what to search for... any hints?
[00:37:42] <mindis|wurk> nisseni like this http://www.ajaxload.info/ ?
[00:38:20] <nisseni> mindis|wurk: perfect, thanks
[00:39:25] <aple> It's not straightforward to me.
[00:39:38] <aple> Did you get it?
[00:40:14] <lc3> aple: one sec
[00:44:49] <mindis|wurk> shit. this loop used to work, i don't get it
[00:44:57] <ppcano> hi, i am having problem getting the real height of an element. The element has assigned ( position: absolute and height 100%) and its placed inside a element with (absolute-top:50px), when i do $('#id').height ---> get the window height, instead of window height - 50px. I read about 100% height jquery problem, but i didn't still figure out how to fix my problem. ideas/hints/recommendations?????
[00:45:34] <LordThumper> apl
[00:45:37] <LordThumper> aple
[00:45:39] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/LGnm7/2/
[00:46:18] <LordThumper> ups
[00:46:19] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/LGnm7/3/
[00:46:24] <LordThumper> ^^
[00:46:51] <lc3> yeah, that
[00:48:42] <rknLA> how do you do something like var someStr = "#foo"; $(someStr) ?  i'm getting nothing =\
[00:49:35] <LordThumper> var someStr = $("#foo")
[00:49:48] <LordThumper> You probably want something like var someStr = $("#foo").text()
[00:50:07] <LordThumper> then just someStr
[00:50:22] <aple> LordThumper: Awesome! Works like a charm!
[00:50:32] <LordThumper> yw
[00:50:54] <rknLA> can't do that.
[00:50:59] <rknLA> it's more complicated..
[00:51:35] <LordThumper> What do you want to store in someStr?
[00:51:40] <LordThumper> An element?
[00:51:42] <LordThumper> Or just text?
[00:51:44] <rknLA> var ix = comesFromSomewhereElse(); var str = "foo" + ix; $("#" + str).whatever
[00:52:11] <lc3> that should work
[00:52:15] <rknLA> it's not.
[00:52:22] <lc3> then something else is going wrong
[00:52:45] <LordThumper> What is the contents of str ?
[00:52:45] <rknLA> nope,
[00:52:49] <rknLA> doing this all in console.
[00:52:51] <LordThumper> Check with console
[00:53:02] <LordThumper> after var str = "foo" + ix;
[00:53:07] <lc3> make sure 1) ix is what you want it to be 2) "foo" + ix is what you want it to be 3) $("#whatever").whatever() is valid
[00:53:30] <lc3> as for me, i'm just going to sit here and punch myself in the head
[00:53:43] <rknLA> i literally typed "foo" + ix in the console, copied the string that was output, and put it into the $() and got the right element
[00:53:59] <rknLA> but when i do $("foo" + ix) i get an empty array
[00:54:08] <LordThumper> Ofcourse
[00:54:10] <LordThumper> there is no #
[00:54:31] <rknLA> http://imgur.com/Jsydg
[00:54:45] <rknLA> ok, error in translating to irc.
[00:54:50] <rknLA> there was a #
[00:54:57] <mindis|wurk> if i want to create 10 buttons that each alert their corresponding number from 1 to 10, but don't want to do them one by one, how do i do it?
[00:55:11] <LordThumper> Can you put that in jsfiddle?
[00:55:30] <rknLA> ugh. it's coffee script, kindof a pain in the ass.
[00:55:52] <LordThumper> Ah np
[00:55:58] <LordThumper> Could it be the escape characters?
[00:56:04] <rknLA> and i couldn't get autocomplete to work in jsfiddle earlier
[00:56:10] <rknLA> ah, maybe..
[00:56:17] <rknLA> it could be iterpretting them..
[00:57:38] <rknLA> nope,
[00:57:41] <rknLA> not the \\'s
[00:58:04] <Cork> jsfiddle donesn't support coffie no
[00:58:14] <rknLA> i wrote it in JS for fiddle
[00:58:22] <rknLA> http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/A7tEm/5/
[00:58:40] <rknLA> it's dated, i was trying to get the individual input from the class,
[00:59:32] <rknLA> i think it's related to this: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_select_elements_when_I_already_have_a_DOM_element.3F
[01:00:08] <rknLA> where instead of "[object HTMLElement]" it's putting something like "[object String]"?
[01:00:35] <LordThumper> rknLA: I have to go for 15 mins brb, if you haven't found the problem when I'm back I'll try to help
[01:00:41] <rknLA> k
[01:00:42] <rknLA> thanks
[01:07:05] <mindis|wurk> hmh, jsfiddle seems pretty broken
[01:07:30] <Woet> jqfiddle!
[01:07:35] <Woet> www.jqfiddle.com
[01:11:52] <mindis|wurk> http://jsfiddle.net/Sy6RQ/ how do i change this so that it alerts the right number instead of the last index?
[01:12:14] <mindis|wurk> assuming you can't use the val of the button itself
[01:12:50] <rknLA> change alert(i) to alert(this.val())?
[01:13:03] <mindis|wurk> i just said you can't do that ;)
[01:14:00] <mindis|wurk> for some reason i had something similar that worked but now it doesn't so i'm a bit stuck
[01:14:49] <rknLA> same time.
[01:14:55] <rknLA> http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/Sy6RQ/5/
[01:15:41] <mindis|wurk> nope sorry, that won't do either. nothing that retrieves the value from the button
[01:15:51] <rknLA> uhm..
[01:16:07] <rknLA> did you try the link i posted?
[01:16:17] <mindis|wurk> yes
[01:16:24] <mindis|wurk> isn't that the same thing?
[01:16:24] <rknLA> what browser are you using?
[01:16:27] <rknLA> uh no.
[01:16:35] <rknLA> did you actually click on a button?
[01:17:05] <mindis|wurk> i did but isn't that doing the same thing as calling $(this).val()?
[01:17:12] <rknLA> no.
[01:17:25] <rknLA> $(this) and the passed in event aren't the same thing.
[01:17:48] <aaronmcadam> in most cases they point to the same obj tho
[01:17:58] <mindis|wurk> and precisely why it won't work for me
[01:18:14] <rknLA> http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/Sy6RQ/8/
[01:18:14] <aaronmcadam> what does this.value give u
[01:18:35] <mindis|wurk> it retrieves the value from the button yes but i don't want the value from the button itself, i'll be using an array
[01:18:53] <aaronmcadam> fiddle's takin ages
[01:18:58] <rknLA> suddenly your cannonical example is not your cannonical example.
[01:19:07] <mindis|wurk> ypi
[01:19:10] <mindis|wurk> gah
[01:19:24] <mindis|wurk> this was in reference to what i said earlier
[01:19:52] <rknLA> post a fiddle with what you're actually trying to accomplish
[01:23:11] <mindis|wurk> well it should be something akin to this http://jsfiddle.net/Sy6RQ/9/
[01:24:00] <rknLA> http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/Sy6RQ/10/
[01:24:03] <rknLA> really easy
[01:24:44] <mindis|wurk> nnnoooooo
[01:25:45] <mindis|wurk> sigh, let me change it so you can't use the damn button for the value
[01:26:19] <rknLA> you do understand that the function is called long after the for loop has executed, right?
[01:26:29] <mindis|wurk> i do
[01:26:33] <rknLA> and you understand that the value for i when the for loop is done is going to be the max value, right?
[01:26:41] <mindis|wurk> yes
[01:28:03] <rknLA> this: http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/Sy6RQ/11/  is roughly equivalent to what you posted
[01:29:51] <mindis|wurk> so it seems to be. and?
[01:31:12] <jac0bz1> Anyone here from Enland or US? I have an non-related question :)
[01:31:41] <rknLA> mindis|wurk: sorry, i don't understand your problem.
[01:31:45] <rknLA> jac0bz1: i'm in the US
[01:32:00] <jac0bz1> My wife has a problem with here wedding-dress. the seams(?) in the dress is coming out
[01:32:10] <jac0bz1> How would you describe that in proper english
[01:32:27] <jac0bz1> The seams come undone?
[01:32:40] <mindis|wurk> rknLA the problem is that i need to be able to be able to refer to the corresponding cell in the array when clicking a button made in the loop
[01:33:05] <mindis|wurk> but as you said yourself, the looping index can't be used
[01:33:21] <rknLA> i gave you a solution to that problem and you said it didn't solve your problem,
[01:33:30] <rknLA> so either that's not your problem, or you have other, larger problems
[01:33:49] <mindis|wurk> we have some serious communication error here
[01:34:04] <jac0bz1> rknLA: The tread/line/seam are beeing pulled out of the dress.. But i cant figure out how to explain that in English to the store we got the dress..
[01:34:49] <rknLA> oh that's what you meant by non-related..
[01:34:55] <jac0bz1> :)
[01:34:56] <jac0bz1> yes
[01:35:15] <rknLA> yes, the seam is coming undone
[01:35:29] <jac0bz1> Ok. Thank you! :D
[01:35:35] <rknLA> mindis|wurk: yes, i don't understand why you can't use event.target.value.
[01:36:04] <mindis|wurk> rknLA because the buttons won't have value that's an index in the array
[01:36:38] <rknLA> put that in the fiddle then!!
[01:36:41] <rknLA> what values will they have?
[01:36:59] <mindis|wurk> arbitrary words
[01:37:00] <Eising> Hi there
[01:37:51] <rknLA> mindis|wurk: at all related to the data?
[01:38:07] <mindis|wurk> rknLA pretty much not related
[01:38:42] <Eising> I'm trying to get the .each() function to manipulate with .children, with no real luck. An example of what I'm doing looks like this: $(".myfieldset").each(function() { $(this).children(".someclass").hide() });
[01:39:37] <Eising> when I type it in the javascript console, I get no errors, but nothing happens
[01:39:57] <mindis|wurk> that's because there's nothing wrong semantically
[01:40:03] <Cork> Eising: why don't you just select the child in the selector?
[01:40:41] <Cork> $(".myfieldset > .someclass").each(function() { $(this).hide() });
[01:40:44] <aple> I'm trying to make a checkbox filterable portfolio. I expect these options to return 1 result ("SweetCo"), but they're returning EVERY "award winning" and "logo design" result. Anyone care to help a brutha out? http://jsfiddle.net/dE2Zw/1/
[01:42:01] <Eising> Cork: because in my real code, I check for stuff before, with an if ($(this).children(".somecheckbox").is(":checked")...
[01:42:14] <Cork> aple: you have an or select, not an and
[01:42:36] <Cork> Eising: ok, your sure you want children and not .find?
[01:42:53] <Cork> Eising: as it, are the children your looking for direct assentent?
[01:42:56] <Cork> *as in
[01:43:01] <Eising> Cork: yes, it needs to be the children
[01:43:10] <Cork> *decentent >_<''
[01:43:51] <rknLA> mindis|wurk: http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/Sy6RQ/15/
[01:43:53] <Cork> Eising: children will return span in <div><span></span></div> but not in <div><div><span></span></div></div>
[01:44:10] <rknLA> mindis|wurk: relies on html5 data- though…
[01:44:15] <Cork> Eising: if you want span in both situations you need .find
[01:44:24] <Eising> Cork: I have a dynamic number of fieldsets that have the same elements, and I want to iterate through them and see if they have a certain checkbox checked. If the checkbox is checked, then it needs to add a number of classes to futher child elements
[01:44:46] <Eising> ah, so find is the way
[01:44:51] <Cork> yes
[01:44:53] <rknLA> LordThumper: you back by chance?
[01:45:08] <aple> Cork: I don't see where I have an or-select.
[01:46:08] <Cork> aple: in the .each you loop over each checkbox and sow all the elements it matches
[01:46:20] <Cork> it doesn't check if any checkbox doens't match
[01:46:37] <Cork> thats an or filter
[01:46:51] <Eising> Cork: perfect! That works. Thanks :)
[01:47:00] <Cork> Eising: np :)
[01:47:01] <aple> Hm, k, will look into it. Thanks Cork
[01:47:08] <Cork> good luck :)
[01:47:15] <mindis|wurk> rknLA mmmyes i was considering some kind of custom attributes if nothing else works
[01:47:48] <rknLA> data-foo is part of the html5 standard.  i thought about it cause i saw twitter using it all over the place when i was poking around their source
[01:48:05] <rknLA> imho it's actually a quite elegant approach
[01:48:07] <aple> So tired. All text is blurring together. :)
[01:48:26] <Cork> rknLA: if you ever want to put extra data on an element, thats the only way to do it :)
[01:48:43] <Cork> rknLA: and even better $(selector).data() reads it by default
[01:48:52] <rknLA> ah, nice
[01:48:55] <Cork> (doesn't set it though)
[01:48:56] <rknLA> TIL
[01:49:43] <rknLA> Cork:  did you happen to catch the weird issue i was having earlier with using a string in a variable as a selector?
[01:49:52] <Peeter> Hello
[01:49:54] <Cork> nope
[01:50:03] <Peeter> Does anyone have any idea how I could get the URL from the jquery ajax object?
[01:51:15] <Cork> Peeter: i don't think you can
[01:51:26] <rknLA> Cork: here's a screenshot of my console.. http://imgur.com/Jsydg  basically, the value of the string works when put directly into $(), but not when it's in a variable
[01:51:36] <Peeter> If Im writing an ajax error handler, how am I supposed to log out which url failed :P?
[01:52:29] <Cork> rknLA: you have \\ in your variable
[01:52:35] <rknLA> yes,
[01:52:41] <Cork> it shoudl be \
[01:52:46] <rknLA> i've tried various combinations of \\, \\\\, \\\\\, etc
[01:53:02] <Cork> "\\[" converted to input string is => "\\\\["
[01:53:31] <Cork> it should be inputed as "\\[" and the variable should contain "\["
[01:53:50] <rknLA> son of a...
[01:53:53] <rknLA> thats it!
[01:54:14] * rknLA praises Cork.
[01:54:24] <rknLA> i tried more \\\\\s, but not fewer
[01:54:31] <Cork> :)
[01:54:43] <Cork> you could put a few \ in your id tag ;)
[01:55:02] <rknLA> lolol
[01:55:09] <rknLA> unfortunately it's autogen'd by rails.
[01:55:10] <raj> is $('#position') without .val() sent as json?
[01:55:18] <Cork> rknLA: ya i know
[01:55:21] <rknLA> i could change them all by hand, but then my template would get reallly realllly fugly
[01:55:23] <Cork> been there done that :)
[01:55:29] <raj> position is a textbox
[01:55:52] <aple> Cork: So what would the alternative be to $.each?
[01:56:04] <Cork> raj: no it will be a html element converted to text "<HTML Element>"
[01:56:06] <raj> {value: $('#position')} ?
[01:56:32] <Cork> raj: what type of element is #position?
[01:56:38] <rknLA> yesssss!!!!!
[01:56:41] <raj> input box
[01:56:43] <rknLA> motherfucking autocomplete!!!
[01:56:58] <rknLA> (two movies and two glasses of whiskey later…)
[01:56:59] <rknLA> =D
[01:57:07] <raj> good exercise
[01:57:10] <Cork> raj: simplest would prob be to use .serializeArray see ?serializeArray
[01:57:11] <bot-t> raj, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[01:57:53] <raj> Cork, hmm,, for autocomplete as well?
[01:58:27] <Cork> not sure, prob not even
[01:58:37] <Cork> but in that case you need .val()
[01:59:15] <Cork> aple: var arr = $.map($(selector), function(elm) { return $(elm).something_that_returns_what_you_want(); });
[02:01:33] <rknLA> ok, with that, it's time for bed.  goodnight ya'll
[02:03:30] <raj> what's somethingthatreturnswhatyouwant?
[02:03:41] <raj> ()
[02:04:10] <raj> like .val() or .text()?
[02:04:16] <Cork> ya
[02:04:26] <Cork> what ever you want the array to contain from each element in the selector
[02:06:23] <raj> $('#position') returns an array literal?
[02:06:39] <raj> can I not just throw {} on that and send it back to my server to unpack?
[02:06:43] <Cork> no it returns a jquery object
[02:06:58] <aple> Thanks Cork! :
[02:07:00] <aple> :)
[02:07:05] <sedavand> is the UI autocomplete broken?
[02:07:09] <Cork> raj: and it contains an array of dom elements
[02:07:26] <Cork> raj: dom elements can't be converted to a string of element values
[02:07:45] <raj> they aren't key/value pairs, right?
[02:07:48] <raj> it's just a list
[02:07:57] <Cork> raj: mainly cause it might varly what value you want (the class name, (as in dom class, not the class attribute)
[02:08:05] <Cork> raj: or text or html or val
[02:08:13] <Cork> raj: no they arn't
[02:08:26] <Cork> its a list of dom element pointers
[02:08:45] <Cork> as in the same kind of object you get from document.getElementById()
[02:08:47] <raj> ah
[02:14:43] <LordThumper> raj: You can do var elements = $(".position"). Then elements.each(function () { console.log($(this).val() });
[02:15:56] <LordThumper> Or just $(".position").each(function () { $(this).html() } )
[02:16:16] <LordThumper> * $(".position").each(function () { console.log($(this).html()) } )
[02:18:23] <LordThumper> or $(".position").each(function () { arraylist.push($(this).html()) } ) To store the contents in an array
[02:18:35] <anli_> Last time I created an event handler for when text in an input type="text" had been changed, I used a timer, is there some other ways thats better?
[02:18:44] <anli_> Like keydown or something
[02:20:48] <steveccc> can anyone recommend a good plugin that has an image banner and immediately by the side has selections which alter what is displayed in the ad banner
[02:30:25] <raj> thank you LordThumper, that was excellent
[02:32:41] <mayhem93> is it possible to bind the same event on the same element twice?
[02:33:56] <quicksilver> yes
[02:37:10] <blimey> If i have <table id = "myTable"><tr id = "row1">... how can i reference row1 to change it's contents? tried  $('row1').text("xxxx");
[02:37:59] <bjensen> its #row1
[02:38:03] <bjensen> not row1
[02:38:14] <ravenzz> $('#row1')
[02:38:18] <blimey> thanks :)
[02:38:20] <bjensen> right
[02:39:56] <quicksilver> although you can't have "text" on a <tr>
[02:41:04] <Cork> quicksilver: you can't?
[02:41:43] <blimey> should  i be using innerhtml or something then?, not looked a javascript for a while.
[02:41:50] <ravenzz> html()
[02:42:02] <ravenzz> ?html @ blimey
[02:42:03] <bot-t> blimey, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[02:42:10] <Trisox> could someone take a look what i'm doing woring with this regex ?
[02:42:12] <Trisox>         $.validator.addMethod("preventhash", function(value, element){return this.optional(element) || /^[#]+$/.test( value );}, "# no hashtags plz");
[02:42:16] <quicksilver> Cork: don't think so. <tr>s can only contain <td>s, not text elements directly.
[02:42:31] <Cork> quicksilver: it runs innerText
[02:42:37] <Cork> so it should work just fine
[02:42:46] <mayhem93> is there a selector to filter to n-th ancestor?
[02:42:53] <Cork> quicksilver: http://jsfiddle.net/w3aVJ/
[02:43:11] <mayhem93> i have an element which is known, and another element which is a 2nd grade ancestor
[02:43:16] <mayhem93> and i want to select that ancestor
[02:43:32] <quicksilver> Cork: yes, but setting it doesn't make sense
[02:43:38] <quicksilver> although in chrome at least, setting it seems to work
[02:43:45] <Cork> heh true, missed that :)
[02:43:50] <quicksilver> but leaves you with a DOM which is no longer HTML compliant
[02:43:53] <quicksilver> which is a bit odd
[02:43:57] <quicksilver> chrome-- # full of odd
[02:44:09] <Trisox> Cork: any idea how to do the regex
[02:44:35] <mayhem93> is .parents() good for my case? :)
[02:44:42] <blimey> thanks, another simple one, the table row will be a variable so should i escape like $("'#"+variable+"'").text("HI")?? seems messy
[02:45:06] <raj> what is $("#loggedin_js").tmpl(data).appendTo("#loginarea") within a success(function(data){
[02:45:09] <Cork> Trisox: i suspect you want /[^@]/g
[02:45:25] <raj> basically, what is $("#loggedin_js") doing there?
[02:45:26] <Trisox> more like /[^#]/g ?
[02:45:27] <Cork> opps
[02:45:35] <Cork> Trisox: no i should be /[@]/g
[02:45:35] <Trisox> then
[02:45:41] <Trisox> for preventing #
[02:45:45] <Cork> uh... wrong char :)
[02:45:46] <raj> the data just gets appended to #loginarea
[02:45:55] <Cork> Trisox: the selector has to see if it exists
[02:46:01] <Trisox> ill try  /[^#]/g ?
[02:46:02] <raj> so what's the other object for?
[02:46:04] <Cork> Trisox: else it just checks if theres anything else
[02:46:09] <Cork> Trisox: won't work
[02:46:10] <Trisox> right
[02:46:32] <Trisox> oke but what do i have to use then
[02:46:38] <Trisox> now it validates only when using #
[02:46:39] <Trisox> :P
[02:46:42] <Trisox>        $.validator.addMethod("preventhash", function(value, element){return this.optional(element) || /^[#]+$/.test( value );}, "# no hashtags plz");
[02:47:11] <Cork> !(/\#/g.test(value))
[02:47:53] <Trisox> k
[02:48:37] <Cork> heck you prob don't even need the g
[02:49:09] <Trisox> mm i need to remove the ^ cause it needs to check whole value
[02:49:22] <Cork> !(/\#/.test(value)) should do it
[02:49:30] <Trisox> let me try
[02:49:36] <raj> better question--> how do I extract the json array returned by my server?
[02:49:50] <raj> it's returned as `data`
[02:50:09] <Cork> or if you want to check for more values !(/[\#agb]/.test(value)
[02:50:12] <Trisox> thnx
[02:50:13] <Trisox> http://c9.io/trisox/jqueryhashtagvalidation/workspace/index.html
[02:50:14] <Cork> )
[02:50:15] <Trisox> works
[02:50:16] <raj> Say I want the array to show up in a div
[02:50:21] <Trisox> :D
[02:50:55] <raj> data.deserialize?
[02:50:58] <raj> data.deserialize()?
[02:51:13] <Cork> raj: you mean like append the values or what?
[02:51:28] <raj> yes sir, but into a div
[02:51:33] <raj> will I have to custom create the html around it?
[02:52:06] <raj> i just want the array listed, perhaps the first 8 things
[02:52:09] <ecdu> some patch for "event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future." in jqueryui 1.8.X?
[02:52:15] <Cork> raj: $.each(arr, function(text) { $div.append(text + '<br/>'); });
[02:52:28] <Stooge> raj put it into <ul> also then?
[02:52:34] <raj> good idea
[02:53:13] <raj> cool, thanks Cork, that looks good
[02:53:18] <Cork> ecdu: webkit has warned for that for years
[02:53:31] <raj> Cork, would it be very difficult to do it without $.each?
[02:53:56] <Stooge> raj do you know the array size?
[02:54:00] <Stooge> is it fixed size?
[02:54:02] <Cork> raj: $div.append(arr.join('<br/>'));
[02:54:17] <ecdu> cork: i saw it for first time this morning when i upgraded my chrome
[02:54:30] <Cork> ecdu: its been there for a long long time
[02:54:44] <raj> it's not fixed
[02:55:01] <raj> I can guarantee a max of 8 though
[02:55:17] <Cork> raj: if you use .join it doesn't matter
[02:55:45] <raj> Cork, ohhh, very clever
[02:55:47] <Cork> the '<br/>' is whats put inbetween, so if you don't want rows, use space or something
[02:55:47] <raj> ok, cool
[02:56:03] <raj> gotcha
[02:56:10] <ecdu> cork: so, just ignore it for now right?
[02:56:25] <Cork> ecdu: ya
[02:56:38] <ecdu> cork: thx
[02:56:46] <raj> funilly, I'm actually gonna use $.each, just cuz I think it might be more durable
[02:56:51] <raj> maybe for highlighting or something
[02:57:28] <Cork> raj: it will be slower so if you handle large arrays it matters, if not... not really :)
[02:58:19] <raj> is the only way to highlight them individually to put each item in the array within a div?
[02:58:23] <js-irc> ohai iaj

[03:39:43] <dean[w]> Hi guys, quick question. This: $(".rating-t", popup).attr("class") returns this: 'rating-t icon-28x28 r5' so why does this: $(".rating-t", popup).attr("class").split("/\s+/") return this: ["rating-t icon-28x28 r5"] <-- I would expect 3 elements, not one
[03:46:29] <mindis|wurk> ugggh. i so hate arrays in js
[03:49:59] <blimey> Hi, I want to use a variable in $('#container').text("HI"), should i escape it like so $("'#"+variable+"'").text("HI")??
[03:54:45] <angelkoilov> blimey: no
[03:54:50] <angelkoilov> $(variable) work
[03:54:59] <angelkoilov> $('#' + variable) work too
[03:59:47] <blimey> angelkoilov, first one didn't seem to work but second one did, you saved me loads of time thank you very much.
[04:00:15] <donCams> anybody here have experience with facebook javascript sdk?
[04:01:34] <angelkoilov> blimey: it depends what variable is
[04:01:41] <angelkoilov> try variable.toString()
[04:03:14] <mindis|wurk> what the...i managed to write a loop that doesn't go through itself every time but doesn't cause errors either
[04:03:32] <ecdu> dean[w]: don't use regex syntax, just the space
[04:03:38] <ecdu> dean[w]: console.log("hello stupid world".split(' '));
[04:04:05] <dean[w]> ecdu, sometimes developers put in more than one space between classnames
[04:04:30] <ecdu> dean[w]: bad devs
[04:04:42] <ecdu> dean[w]: so, sanitaze before parse
[04:04:54] <xec> dean[w]: dont put your regex in quotes
[04:06:31] <xec> ?eval 'rating-t icon-28x28 r5'.split(/\s+/);
[04:06:33] <bot-t> xec: ["rating-t", "icon-28x28", "r5"]

[04:26:28] <mayhem93> w3 should have thought about that back in 99 -.-
[04:31:07] <blimey> I want to change the whole row of a table, the variable is the row i.d.. $('#'+variable).text('<tr id = '+variable+'><td>'+variable+'</td></tr>') doesn't work properly, it replaces row with raw text. can someone point me in the right direction please?
[04:31:59] <ecdu> blimey: use html() instead of text() method
[04:32:55] <blimey> I tried that, it works but the rest of the table rows disappear :(
[04:36:02] <blimey> ecdu, o.k. working thanks with html, i shouldn't have replaced the tr id by the looks of it.
[04:38:30] <Guest7157> Hello! I'm realy stuck on a problem in IE7 and I hope you can give me some pointers. Did you ever face the problem that jQuery cannot identify any elements by class in IE7?
[04:39:20] <Sonderblade> Guest7157: no
[04:39:23] <xec> Guest7157: can't say I have. do you get the same results in IE8?
[04:39:36] <Guest7157> nope, IE8 works fine
[04:39:39] <ecdu> Guest7157: no
[04:39:45] <Guest7157> no errors, nothing :(
[04:40:04] <ecdu> Guest7157: are you using some multiple ie or something like that?

[04:46:25] <raj> how do I find all html elements with an "asdf" attribute?
[04:46:45] <SugaSlide> $("el[attr='this']")

[04:47:06] <raj> what's el?
[04:47:10] <LordThumper> element
[04:47:14] <ecdu> lol
[04:47:23] <SugaSlide> $("div[attr='asdf']")
[04:47:26] <SugaSlide> etc
[04:47:45] <SugaSlide> or just
[04:47:53] <SugaSlide> $("*[attr='asdf']")
[04:47:55] <SugaSlide> i think
[04:48:01] <raj> cool
[04:48:03] <gao>  is div:first the same as div.eq(1)?
[04:48:03] <raj> i like that

[04:48:14] <SugaSlide> altho ive never done it that way before :(
[04:48:21] <Guest7157> ecdu Sry dot missing - I was trying to say that although I can find the element in the dom the method .attr("class") returns undefined
[04:48:30] <ecdu> gao: depends on the context
[04:49:12] <ecdu> Guest7157: but you are using two jquery selectors
[04:49:30] <ecdu> Guest7157: $('body').find('div:first').attr("class")
[04:50:01] <ecdu> Guest7157: are you sure the selector matches the /div that has the @class?
[04:50:39] <Guest7157> ecdu: Jep, just one of my samples testing around. $('div:first').attr("class") is the same
[04:51:15] <ecdu> Guest7157: this is not the same: $($('body'))
[04:51:29] <ecdu> Guest7157: note the two $ lol
[04:52:47] <Guest7157> @ecdu ah yeah... copy paste is better the remeber from brain... I used the second $ as I adressed the children with $(...)[x] and then I need the second $

[05:17:28] <lugzer> hi
[05:18:23] <lugzer> is there any way to beautify/simplify such piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/dU9RP/1/ -- i can't stand it.. ;)
[05:18:32] <becom33> I need a page which separate in to cart and corp site. like this http://itgallery.lk/
[05:18:52] <Guest7157> ecdu: done, alert message: undefined
[05:19:15] <ecdu> Guest7157: that means that the dom is not fully loaded
[05:19:17] <becom33> but that is not catchy enough so . I want somthing animated . like in flash . bt I thoughtsomthing to do with JQuery
[05:19:20] <becom33> any help ?
[05:20:15] <ecdu> Guest7157: why are you loading the js via append?
[05:20:35] <Guest7157> ecdu: When I execute alert(SIBE('.seekdaPortalWidget')[0]); directly in the console (after everything is loaded) alert message is still undefined
[05:21:05] <ecdu> Guest7157: try the same in chrome
[05:21:07] <becom33> anyon for me ?
[05:21:24] <Guest7157> ecdu: The small form is meant to be a widget
[05:21:47] <xec> becom33: what exactly is your question, and how does it relate to jQuery?
[05:21:58] <Guest7157> ecdu: chrome says: [object HTMLDivElement]
[05:22:04] <xec> also, what is "shooping" and "coparate" :P
[05:23:21] <ecdu> Guest7157: the dom is not really ready in ie7. When are you executing the selector? I mean, documet ready, onload...? or it is just called as it is loaded?
[05:24:03] <becom33> xec I just somthing animated eye catching. I dont even know what they call that type of websites
[05:24:08] <becom33> I mean webpage
[05:24:34] <Guest7157> ecdu: right now it is loaded on $('document').ready but I also tried (function() { ...})() and to exectue it in the IE console
[05:25:02] <xec> becom33: i'm not sure what you want, if you want to animate using jQuery you can see ?animate
[05:25:03] <bot-t> becom33, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:25:42] <ecdu> Guest7157: $('document').ready of the first loaded js or the in-time loaded js?
[05:26:17] <becom33> xec: what do u call web pages links in to other pages like this http://itgallery.lk/
[05:26:31] <xec> becom33: splash page perhaps?
[05:26:44] <Guest7157> ecdu: I added document.ready at the end of the in-time loaded js
[05:27:34] <ecdu> Guest7157: .seekdaPortalWidget is loaded from server response or created via js?
[05:28:55] <becom33> xec I dont thats what is it called . Im looking for a better eye catchig example
[05:29:02] <Guest7157> ecdu: creaded from js with document.createElement("div")
[05:32:43] <ecdu> Guest7157: for some reason the createElement is kind of slow in ie and the in-time js is trying to use an element that may be is not fully loaded o created. I supose that you are loading the in-time js after you create the /div element right?
[05:33:33] <fotoflo> hmm, is there a $.cookie() function? I am looking at some stuff that says their is but i don't see it in official docs
[05:34:09] <fotoflo> oh, sorry, looks like it's a plugin?
[05:34:27] <ecdu> fotoflo: it's a plugin. Try this https://github.com/elchacaldelutero/jecookie
[05:35:04] <ecdu> fotoflo: cookie with json support lol!
[05:35:37] <Guest7157> ecdu: Yes, I'm loading the in-time js after creating the element
[05:35:45] <midnight88> hey guys, could yuo help with troubleshooting http://pastebin.com/WKVCbY96 ? My Goal is to cope a bunch of html elements and specify handler for each of them, for some reason this handler gets executed proportionally to the number of times the original-template chunk is copied
[05:36:07] <fotoflo> also q #2, if i have some globals (like the username, user ID), should i set them in document.globalVarName or in the cookie?
[05:36:15] <fotoflo> or does it not matter?
[05:37:12] <ecdu> fotoflo: this info is for each session or do you want to save it for the next session?
[05:37:44] <fotoflo> it will be cross session - but i need fast access to it
[05:37:50] <fotoflo> right now i am am putting some info in both places
[05:38:05] <fotoflo> document.user.id  and cookie ID, for example
[05:38:26] <fotoflo> is the cookie slower then a variable?
[05:38:28] <ecdu> fotoflo: document info is faster
[05:38:55] <fotoflo> ok, thanks
[05:39:37] <fotoflo> that link has still not fully loaded
[05:39:37] <JKarsrud> But it's not cross session.. You could use localstorage too, I guess?
[05:39:43] * fotoflo HATES his ISP
[05:40:06] <fotoflo> are there advantages to storing in localstorage/cookie/global?
[05:40:59] <ecdu> fotoflo: localstorage is html5
[05:41:10] <fotoflo> ecdu: that's a disadvantage
[05:41:46] <ecdu> Guest7157: i think there is a problem when loading the new js
[05:42:40] <ecdu> Guest7157: try to use a library that load the in-time resources for example: http://labjs.com/
[05:46:20] <ecdu> fotoflo: cookies are unsafe (because some browsers, or physical attacks) but they are cross session, javascripts objects are faster and secure but not cross session (SESSION.id) and localstorage is html5, cross-session, slower than javascripts variables and not fully implemented in all browsers.
[05:46:46] <fotoflo> ecdu: THANKyou!
[05:48:43] <jvargas> hi
[05:49:35] <jvargas> Which selector to use for getting a specific input with ID="status" from form "myForm"?
[05:50:26] <jvargas> I can get the form, and all inputs in form (":input"), but I am not able to select a specific input in that form.
[05:50:47] <blimey> I have a table and the rows have an onclick, when i update the row and onclick as below, both the old and new onclick's fire, how do i remove the old one please?     var newrow = $('<td>'+unit.idid+'</td><td>'+unit.time+'</td></tr>');
[05:50:49] <blimey>     newrow.click(function() {alert(unit.time)});
[05:50:51] <blimey>     $('#'+unit.id).html(newrow);
[05:51:37] <Guest7157> ecdu: hmm... they are doing it the same way except the setTimeout : https://gist.github.com/603980
[05:52:14] <ecdu> Guest7157: this setTimeout is just what you need, it's the time that Ie needs to fully render the elements
[05:53:04] <Guest7157> ecdu: ok, I'll try it this way. Thank you a lot for your help!
[05:53:07] <ecdu> I have to leave. CU
[05:53:19] <ecdu> Guest7157: you're welcome ;)
[05:53:21] <ecdu> bye
[05:53:29] <Guest7157> Thx ecdu ! bye!
[05:54:13] <Trudko> Guys I am have elements with id = someting_unknownNumber_knownnumber and I need selector for it ->  <div id="Something_555_333" ></div> How to find this element if I don't know  middle number(555)
[05:55:42] <t4nkd> hey jQ, is this the correct syntax(or approach?) for binding two functions for an ajax.success? https://gist.github.com/2946fe00e4e4a20149a2
[05:55:46] <blimey> trudko I think grep will do what you want but I am no expert.
[05:56:04] <t4nkd> It seems like the functionality isn't working in IE9 so I assume there's some kind of typo
[05:57:50] <Trudko> blimey: grep?
[05:58:03] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/0rdlw0hgtnxkneaxpgr8a - I'm trying to make a show "link" here not sure what I'm doing wrong, I'm not getting errors
[05:58:49] <xec> ?demo @ t4nkd
[05:58:50] <bot-t> t4nkd, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[05:59:12] <xec> i don't see anything wrong at first glance
[06:00:18] <blimey> Trudko, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/  think it will do what you want but as i said I am no expert.
[06:00:24] <t4nkd> Hrm, not sure how I can 'fake' the ajax source there though...
[06:00:43] <Zogot> on the left menu, should be a button named Ajax
[06:01:52] <xec> t4nkd: just do an echo with dummy data, theres an expanation at the bottom left menu iirc
[06:02:00] <t4nkd> ah okay sweet ty
[06:02:19] <astropirate> HELLOO #JQUERY!
[06:03:35] <James13433> I am completely baffiled by this, am I doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/PZjw4/
[06:03:41] <Spuddy> Hi. I'm having trouble with FF not triggering a click event using live(), I've tried using delegate as well to no avail.
[06:03:55] <mayhem93> try .on()
[06:03:56] <James13433> sometime that alerts woop, which should no be possible ?
[06:03:59] <xec> Trudko: you can probably use http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[06:04:06] <Spuddy> I'll try on real quick, thanks.
[06:04:12] <xec> Trudko: and ends with
[06:04:27] <mayhem93> Trudko use what xec said, then a filter with attribute ends with
[06:05:44] <xec> something like $('[id^="Something_"][id$="_333"]')
[06:05:49] <xec> should work
[06:05:53] <xec> i think... :D
[06:06:37] <Spuddy> mayhem93: on() is also not working. :|
[06:07:38] <James13433> I am completely baffiled by this, am I doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/PZjw4/ sometimes it alerts "woop", which shouldnt be possible right?
[06:08:27] <James13433> ahh dm, && not ||
[06:08:34] <xec> :D
[06:08:38] <xec> was about to say
[06:08:52] <mayhem93> Spuddy give us some code :)
[06:08:59] <James13433> thanks
[06:09:47] <Spuddy> mayhem93: http://pastie.org/3154420 Excuse my messy code, I am new to JS.
[06:09:51] <midnight88> hey guys, could you help with troubleshooting http://pastebin.com/WKVCbY96 ? My Goal is to copy a bunch of html elements and specify handler for each of them, for some reason this handler gets executed proportionally to the number of times the original-template chunk is copied
[06:10:53] <mayhem93> omg.... stop censorship thingies
[06:10:53] <mayhem93> -.-
[06:11:08] <astropirate> ?
[06:11:28] <mayhem93> so you're saying it doesnt work in FF?
[06:11:33] <mayhem93> what about chrome ?
[06:11:42] <Spuddy> Not in Chrome now.
[06:12:13] <Spuddy> The whole thing can be found here: http://jjtileandmarble.com/tile/virtual-designer/
[06:13:57] <mayhem93> which line ?
[06:14:23] <blimey> I have a table and the rows have an onclick, when i update the row and onclick as below, both the old and new onclick's fire, how do i remove the old one please?   var newrow = $('<td>'+unit.idid+'</td><td>'+unit.time+'</td></tr>');    newrow.click(function() {alert(unit.time)});     $('#'+unit.id).html(newrow);
[06:14:32] <Spuddy> mayhem93: 45 is where it starts.
[06:14:41] <JohnLe> Spuddy: you're sure the event doesn't fire rather than the code doesn't always perform correctly?
[06:14:59] <Spuddy> I had it originally just ("a#vertical").click and it worked fine in Chrome but not FF.
[06:15:24] <Eviltwin> blimey: You can unbind all click listeners by doing .unbind("click")
[06:15:44] <mayhem93> stepcarousel.js ?
[06:16:11] <Eviltwin> blimey: So if you do that before you bind the new one
[06:16:19] <Eviltwin> blimey: You've effectively replaced the old ones with the new one
[06:16:48] <blimey> thanks Eviltwin
[06:17:16] <Spuddy> mayhem93: Unfortunately I'm coming into this after someone else has done the rest of the site, no idea what that is.
[06:17:31] <mayhem93> yes
[06:17:37] <mayhem93> but i can't find that on line 45
[06:18:09] <Spuddy> Oh my apologies, forgot about WP's crap, the JS is on line 34.
[06:18:44] <mayhem93> on 34 it's getoffset:function(what, offsettype){
[06:18:55] <mayhem93> ah
[06:18:56] <mayhem93> never mind
[06:18:58] <mayhem93> i found it
[06:19:11] <mayhem93> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[06:19:16] <mayhem93> on is from version 1.7+
[06:19:26] <Eviltwin> see ?.on
[06:19:27] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:19:39] <Eviltwin> It shows which version the syntax was added
[06:19:45] <Spuddy> Let me change version number real quick.
[06:20:14] <JJMalina> Can anyone point me to a decent guide on form validation with jQuery?
[06:20:31] <Spuddy> No luck after upgrading.
[06:20:59] <mayhem93> i don't know how it should suppose to work :P
[06:21:39] <Spuddy> Basically if you click a grout color, and then vertical, it should switch to a different image.
[06:22:37] <JJMalina> Is the http://jquery.com loading really slowly for anyone?
[06:22:39] <Spuddy> Hmm...
[06:22:49] <Spuddy> I seem to have gotten it working (a bit) in Chrome again.
[06:23:02] <Spuddy> But not in FF again.
[06:23:34] <astropirate> Spuddy: whats your browser support like
[06:23:39] <mayhem93> i see
[06:23:46] <mayhem93> the element doesn't have any attached event
[06:23:48] <mayhem93> listener
[06:24:42] <Spuddy> Hm?
[06:25:00] <astropirate> Spuddy: you should also look into preloading the images so they dont' load when you click on them
[06:25:27] <JohnLe> Spuddy: What element should have its background change?
[06:25:39] <Spuddy> JohnLe: #groutPreview
[06:25:53] <mayhem93> i usually have use on like this: $("#login_button").on("click", adminLogin);
[06:26:04] <JohnLe> In chrome on my machine the event fires
[06:26:08] <mayhem93> looks like .bind()
[06:26:12] <JohnLe> but the selector doesn't match
[06:26:23] <Spuddy> Yeah Chrome seems to work again, FF still doesn't. The selector doesn't match?
[06:26:35] <Spuddy> (Like I said JS noob here, appreciate all the help.)
[06:26:43] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Spuddy
[06:26:43] <bot-t> Spuddy, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[06:26:44] <mayhem93> so you could use like like $("a#vertical").on("click", function(){})
[06:26:59] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: I highly suggest reading resources there
[06:27:12] <astropirate> ?learn @ Eviltwin
[06:27:12] <bot-t> Eviltwin, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[06:27:26] <Spuddy> I will definitely do that, I was kind of thrown into this from my usual backend work.
[06:27:34] <Spuddy> And it's "urgent."
[06:27:37] <Spuddy> -_-
[06:27:47] <mayhem93> Spuddy try my approach :P
[06:27:49] <mayhem93> see if it works
[06:31:21] <Spuddy> Interesting.
[06:31:24] <JohnLe> Spuddy: it doesn't look like #groutPreview is an ancestor of the link elements
[06:31:36] <Spuddy> .bind worked in Chrome, not FF, but I did alert("testing") and it fired in FF
[06:31:37] <JohnLe> why use closest()?
[06:32:22] <Spuddy> closest is there from when I was attempting body.delegate("click"
[06:32:39] <Spuddy> That's been commented out
[06:33:28] <Spuddy> So now that with bind I know FF does know when I click, it must be something wrong with what's inside.
[06:38:52] <JohnLe> so, parsing the existing background css attribute assumes the value is valid. At some point along the sequence of clicks, the value becomes invalid for me, and the only way to fix it is to click the grout image again, which more explicitly sets the background
[06:41:20] <Spuddy> All right so it sounds like I just need to think of a cleaner solution to changing the background.
[06:41:35] <JohnLe> Spuddy: if it was my code, and I was trying to keep the existing work, I'd probably change the 'var grout' to a public variable like 'activeGrout' and use it when building the background tag
[06:42:00] <JohnLe> if keeping the existing code wasn't as important, I probably do this with named classes
[06:42:15] <supertrue> how do I chain back  to the original selector at the end of this: $(target).siblings().doSomething().???
[06:42:22] <erichynds> .end(), supertrue
[06:42:34] <supertrue> thank you!
[06:42:35] <Spuddy> Thanks JohnLe, that sounds like a good idea.
[06:44:43] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to detect attibute changes across browsers
[06:55:33] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: No
[06:56:56] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: that kind of sucks donkey hooves
[06:58:23] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Some browsers have had events for DOM manipulations
[06:58:39] <Eviltwin> And we all say, "Oh, wow, that'd be fantastic. Why don't they have that any more?"
[06:58:56] <Eviltwin> The reason is that a lot of those event listeners went and made DOM changes
[06:59:18] <Eviltwin> At which point, another DOM event was generated for each change
[06:59:41] <Eviltwin> And if you weren't really, really careful, you quickly ended up in an infinite loop
[06:59:45] <jeffsmykil> ok, and that is bad?
[06:59:52] <Eviltwin> Infinite loops?
[06:59:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[06:59:58] <jeffsmykil> ah
[07:07:01] <sasori> question: what javscript snippet to use, in order for me to redirect the user to a particular page ? let's say e.g i have an href="catalog.php?view=add_to_cart&id=1"  ..once that link is clicked, i want it to get redirected to cart.php ? how's that?
[07:07:11] <sasori> wi/o indicating the domain at all
[07:07:24] <sasori> is that possible ?
[07:07:35] <HarryJ> hi
[07:07:55] <Eviltwin> sasori: window.location = "http://page.to/go/to/"
[07:08:07] <HarryJ>  can i validate a textbox in html page using jquery
[07:08:21] <Eviltwin> Or window.location.assign("http://page.to/go/to/"
[07:08:21] <Eviltwin> )
[07:08:40] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ ?
[07:08:47] <Eviltwin> If you're looking for form validation
[07:08:55] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin:  where am I going wrong?
[07:08:56] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/9MWKQEuY
[07:09:01] <sasori> is it not possible to use only the name of the page without having to include the http and domain ?
[07:09:18] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: You're using the string form of setTimeout
[07:09:21] <Eviltwin> Which is considered a bad practice
[07:09:38] <jeffsmykil> i should call a function?
[07:09:56] <Eviltwin> setTimeout(function(){$('...')...}, 300);
[07:10:08] <JohnLe> sasori: If it's on the same site, yes
[07:10:14] <JohnLe> just use the relative path
[07:10:20] <Eviltwin> sasori: Yeah, it can be a relative path
[07:10:28] <sasori> lemme try ..1 sec..
[07:10:35] <Eviltwin> Works just like a href for an <A>
[07:10:43] <HarryJ> <Eviltwin> do i have to download it. Is there any other way
[07:11:04] <codercube> hi guys, anyone knows when jquery ui 1.9 is coming out?
[07:11:11] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin:  setTimeout(function () { "$('.text inline').addClass('ui-state-error error')", 300 });
[07:11:13] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: Well two things, A) What kind of validation are you trying to do B) Is it just one text field or will you be trying to validate other stuff
[07:11:17] <HarryJ> Eviltwin :do i have to download it. Is there any other way
[07:11:19] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Drop the ""'s
[07:11:26] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[07:11:31] <Eviltwin> And move the } to the right place
[07:11:35] <Eviltwin> Like in my example
[07:11:51] <sasori> didn't work..it got stuck with this catalog.php?view=add_to_cart&id=1
[07:12:18] <sasori> http://jsfiddle.net/xTveT/
[07:13:13] <HarryJ> Eviltwin :i have two text box first one have name and second one have email. The name textbox should not be empty. and i also what to validate weather the email is valid or not.. It should be in the form of string@string.string
[07:13:33] <Eviltwin> sasori: Read this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[07:13:33] <ytre4k0> http://sergey-mavrodi.com/op/view_485.html - your invite: 245006 - invite to take part in a free lottery from Sergey Mavrodi on a site MMM-2011.

[07:13:34] <ytre4k0> great deal!
[07:14:01] <codercube> kick ytre4ko
[07:14:22] <sphinxxx> sasori, window.location overrides whatever you have in the href
[07:14:42] <sphinxxx> you don't need the jquery click handler at all
[07:14:59] <HarryJ> <Eviltwin> i have two text box first one have name and second one have email. The name textbox should not be empty. and i also what to validate weather the email is valid or not.. It should be in the form of string@string.string
[07:15:16] <codercube> none of jquery dev team here?
[07:15:25] <codercube> jquery ui*
[07:15:32] <Eviltwin> codercube: If you're talking dev, #jquery-ui-dev I believe
[07:15:41] <sasori> i don't get it...my objective was, once the user clicks the add to cart button..it gets redirected to the same page..because apparently, when i click the add to cart button, it gets stuck witth catalog.php?view=add_to_cart&id=1 page  :S
[07:15:48] <Eviltwin> Sorry, #jqueryui-dev according to the topic
[07:15:50] <sasori> what should i do ?
[07:16:03] <codercube> Eviltwin : thankz
[07:16:09] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: You're going to use regular expressions to do this
[07:16:25] <sphinxxx> sasori, are you trying to do it with ajax
[07:16:45] <sasori> sphinxxx: nope, just a simple page redirect
[07:16:46] <sphinxxx> if it's a GET request, you should just use a submit button (in a <form>) instead of <a>
[07:17:10] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: I'll make you an example
[07:17:28] <sasori> sphinxxx: we have a custom graphics/button that's why am using an image href instead :S
[07:18:49] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/xTveT/1/
[07:19:12] <sphinxxx> you can still style it with a custom image if its a button
[07:19:40] <jeffsmykil> can i change a span to a p?
[07:19:52] <Guest63102> !ciao
[07:19:56] <codercube> jeffsmykil : use replaceWith
[07:20:01] <Guest63102> !list
[07:20:18] <Eviltwin> Guest63102: no warez here
[07:20:18] <jeffsmykil> do i have to replace the content too codercube ?
[07:21:20] <codercube> jeffsmykil : replaceWith replaces whole element, try something like $("span").replaceWith($(this).html().wrapAll("p"))
[07:22:00] <jeffsmykil> k so i cant just swap out the element types got you
[07:22:51] <codercube> jeffsmykil : i guess you can't, no sure for 100%
[07:24:06] <HarryJ> <Eviltwin> please help
[07:24:19] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: Sorry, interrupted by work work
[07:24:30] <Eviltwin> Will get back to you in a sec
[07:24:34] <HarryJ> <Eviltwin> ok
[07:24:36] <HarryJ> sure.

[07:35:37] <Spuddy> One can hope.
[07:36:04] <Sserg> yeah
[07:37:40] <NoiseEee> Spuddy: $(this.attr("id")); line 7
[07:37:45] <NoiseEee> er 11
[07:38:00] <mantas322> Hi guys!
[07:38:01] <Sserg> I want to make a drop down list which at first contains only one option "Move". Once the user clicks it, it will load the other options from a database through php. I have done something, but it does not show the options until I close it and open it again
[07:38:10] <mantas322> im on the main jquery site
[07:38:26] <mantas322> just curious .... (im new to jquery)   but how different are the different versions
[07:38:40] <PeterB> I'm struggling to remove classes with a regex - it works in the console (printing the correct result), but doesn't update the page
[07:38:40] <PeterB> http://pastebin.com/EBzQvGys
[07:38:53] <Spuddy> NoiseEee: What's wrong it?
[07:38:57] <Spuddy> with*
[07:39:13] <sean`> juha_, ping
[07:39:50] <Eviltwin> HarryJ: http://jsfiddle.net/MEgVY/
[07:39:51] <NoiseEee> Spuddy: don't you mean $(this).attr("id")  or $('#'+this.attr("id"));
[07:39:51] <NoiseEee>  
[07:40:12] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: I think you need to see ?learn
[07:40:12] <bot-t> Spuddy, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[07:40:19] <Eviltwin> Big time
[07:41:15] <Spuddy> I do like I admitted earlier.
[07:41:22] <HarryJ> <Eviltwin>  Thnx..
[07:41:37] <Spuddy> I'm a backend guy, was thrown into this.
[07:42:48] <NoiseEee> Spuddy: just that you've got a lot of useless logic and/or misunderstanding of scope... line 22 for example, whats the point of lines 23 /25 after that?
[07:44:10] <Spuddy> Right.
[07:46:19] <Spuddy> Why would groutId not work later on though?
[07:46:44] <NoiseEee> scope
[07:46:55] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: This is why I tell you you need to learn JavaScript
[07:46:55] <NoiseEee> its defined in the closure, but not anywhere else
[07:47:42] <Spuddy> Eviltwin: I understand your concern, I really do, and I will be doing so at home on my own time.
[07:48:04] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: Those links I sent have lots of fantastic resources
[07:48:13] <Eviltwin> What you're doing right now is coding by trial-and-error
[07:48:23] <Spuddy> Unfortunately, yeah.
[07:48:29] <Eviltwin> Just throwing things together until you get the result you're looking for
[07:48:39] <Eviltwin> Which means you don't understand why something does and doesn't work
[07:48:50] <Eviltwin> Which you will if you actually learn JavaScript first
[07:49:16] <Spuddy> That frustrates me to no end as well.
[07:54:16] <Spuddy> So I figured out that earlier I HAD done var groutId = 0; globally, I just had a syntax error when I was changing it later. Thanks for the help guys, I'll be reading those links tonight Eviltwin. I hate working like this.
[07:56:51] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: JavaScript's scope functions a lot like most languages at the basic level
[07:57:04] <Eviltwin> But it has some scope properties most languages don't
[07:57:09] <Eviltwin> Which is where people tend to get confused
[08:04:42] <cybersholt> good morning all
[08:20:15] <bakers> Is this valid? var qs = document.querySelectorAll;
[08:20:24] <bakers> I want to alias QSA to a simpler easier to type function
[08:20:31] <quicksilver> bakers: yes.
[08:20:38] <quicksilver> it's valid
[08:20:47] <bakers> qs("#body") Error: Could not convert JavaScript argument [Break On This Error] qs("#body")
[08:20:52] <quicksilver> but it won't work the same as document.querySelectorAll
[08:20:58] <quicksilver> because it won't set "this" to document.
[08:21:05] <gnarf> qs.apply( document, "#body" )
[08:21:05] <bakers> ya?
[08:21:22] <gnarf> or sorry qs.call( document, "#body" )
[08:21:25] <Eviltwin> Use bind
[08:21:28] <Eviltwin> If you have it
[08:21:29] <quicksilver> please go directly to Javascript 101, do not pass go, do not collect 200, and learn the language :)
[08:21:34] <Eviltwin> Or $.proxy if you have that
[08:21:46] <gnarf> but you could always use $.proxy / Function.prototype.bind as Eviltwin suggests
[08:21:47] <Eviltwin> var qs = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document)
[08:21:54] <bakers> I'm writing a small bookmarklet and I want to simplify/minify it
[08:22:01] <Eviltwin> var qs = $.proxy(document.querySelectorAll, document);
[08:22:03] <bakers> I was going to make a poor mans selector language
[08:22:35] <Eviltwin> Or var qs = function(){return document.querySelectorAll.apply(document,arguments)}
[08:22:59] <bakers> Eviltwin: Is any of those any more cross browser compliant than the others?
[08:23:18] <gnarf> the last will work unless qsa is missing
[08:23:37] <gnarf> im pretty sure that things that have qsa also have Function#bind
[08:23:40] <gnarf> but i'm not 100% sure
[08:23:51] <gnarf> ?tias
[08:23:51] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:24:01] <bakers> Ok cool thanks
[08:24:13] <Eviltwin> bakers: The last two are the most compliant
[08:24:16] <Eviltwin> Wel
[08:24:17] <Eviltwin> l
[08:24:19] <Eviltwin> Not compliant
[08:24:23] <Eviltwin> But the most supported
[08:24:34] <Eviltwin> The second-to-last requires jQuery though
[08:24:50] <Eviltwin> The second-to-last does what the last one does
[08:24:54] <bakers> Trying to avoid a 30k jquery request for my 1k bookmarklet
[08:25:38] <Eviltwin> Then do the last one
[08:26:29] <Eviltwin> If you're going to use jQuery already, then use $.proxy
[08:29:53] <shwaiil> hi
[08:32:13] <shwaiil> Q: I'm doing .delegate to a class .active. This helps me to see what element is currently to work with. when changing I remove .active from previous el, and add it to new. The problem is that, when running the function, it works strange. I'm wondering if there's a way to remove function association to elements or some function from memory or something like it :P It's because when I run directly on console, it  works. Thanks for looking
[08:32:43] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ shwaiil
[08:32:43] <bot-t> shwaiil, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[08:32:57] <nmee> Hi, I want a jquery event to run when new elements matching a selector appears on the page - what event should I attacht to? Using $(document).on(...
[08:33:12] <Eviltwin> nmee: What you're asking for is not possible
[08:33:48] <Eviltwin> However if you'd like to bind a click etc listener to elements matching a selector (present and future), you can use $(document).on
[08:34:18] <nmee> ok, any common workarounds for it? The JS is stored on the main page, while I want to loop through all elements matching the selector adding some additional information (and those elements are created dynamically)
[08:34:18] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: tks.
[08:34:22] <gnarf> nmee: the event you create yourself....
[08:34:30] <shwaiil> I've used .delegate
[08:34:44] <gnarf> nmee: anytime you add new content, trigger a custom event
[08:35:04] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: What I'm saying is I didn't quite understand what you were asking but if I saw a demo of what you're talking about, it might help me understand.
[08:35:28] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: yes thanks, i'll do that. its quite complex so i'll try to do that later
[08:35:33] <gnarf> ?demo @shwaiil
[08:35:34] <bot-t> shwaiil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:35:38] <nmee> gnarf: will do, it's fairly straightforward. I was hoping something already existed though, it would remove a dependency between different parts of the JS code
[08:35:45] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ shwaiil
[08:35:45] <bot-t> shwaiil, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[08:35:51] <Eviltwin> Keep it small
[08:36:07] <gnarf> jdb? whats that stand for? :)
[08:36:17] <Eviltwin> gnarf: It's a play on GDB
[08:36:25] <gnarf> fair nuff
[08:36:38] <Eviltwin> JavaScript Debug
[08:36:53] <shwaiil> there must be something i'm doing that I dont know about. I've got a .live() call to a function, and this function has stuff bind to class names. When it runs more then once stuff goes wrong :P
[08:37:00] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[08:37:04] <shwaiil> i'll do the jsfiddle thing later
[08:37:06] <shwaiil> yeah "live"
[08:37:17] <shwaiil> "live" was just to explain :)
[08:37:17] <shwaiil> but i'm using .delegate
[08:37:25] <Eviltwin> Then say "delegate" :P
[08:37:30] <gnarf> use .on() if you are using 1.7
[08:37:51] <gnarf> are you binding the event multiple times?
[08:38:00] <gnarf> or is it dependant on a global/unscoped var?
[08:39:06] <Eviltwin> Are you asking about .undelegate?
[08:39:10] <Eviltwin> see ?.undelegate
[08:39:10] <bot-t> .undelegate(): Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[08:39:35] <shwaiil> gnarf: yup, multiple times
[08:39:45] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: yes found right now undelegate, going to try it
[08:39:52] <gnarf> shwaiil: you should only need to bind the event once
[08:40:02] <Eviltwin> (I just finished parsing your question)
[08:40:11] <shwaiil> gnarf: can I check if its already bind ?
[08:40:17] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: Why?
[08:40:20] <Eviltwin> Just bind it once
[08:40:23] <gnarf> shwaiil: why? why not just bind it once?
[08:40:31] <Eviltwin> In $(document).ready
[08:40:40] <Eviltwin> Or if it's on document, even outside
[08:40:44] <shwaiil> because I've wraped this inside a function
[08:40:47] <gnarf> Eviltwin: im gonna step away - we keep echoing ;)
[08:40:51] <shwaiil> when somethig is clicked, its called :X
[08:40:51] <gnarf> and you seem to be typing faster
[08:40:54] <Eviltwin> Then unwrap it from that function
[08:41:52] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: If you're repeatedly adding the same delegate event listener, you're (almost certainly) doing something wrong
[08:42:08] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: thanks for the tips :)
[08:42:13] <shwaiil> I'll work that out
[08:42:18] <nmee> I don't seem to be able to select $('a.specific-class') when those links have been added during runtime by an ajax call - is this common? I didn't expect the selector to treat static/original elements any different from elements dynamically created  (I run the selector in a click event AFTER the elements have been added, so that's not the problem)
[08:42:53] <Eviltwin> nmee: Add a console.log/alert right before you're calling that selector and also right after you're adding them via AJAX
[08:43:09] <Eviltwin> Make sure they've actually been added
[08:43:21] <Eviltwin> Odds are those two things aren't happening in the order you think they are
[08:46:03] <lugzer> hi guys, i have a very simple function here: http://jsfiddle.net/DETYS/1/ -- that makes the #preview-panel stay in fixed position as i scroll the page. however now whenever i scroll past the 69px point, the whole page gets scrolled UP to top, so in fact I can't scroll past that 69px point at all.. any clues please? :/
[08:46:59] <Pilate> theres no real point putting it in jsfiddle if its not an actual example
[08:47:35] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: Consider this example: http://jsfiddle.net/KRJXH/
[08:47:43] <shwaiil> ;)
[08:47:58] <gnarf> shit, Eviltwin - kborchers said you're near us ;)
[08:48:12] <gnarf> we need a Chicago/Suburbs #jquery meetup
[08:48:18] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: yeah, I see your point. I removed from function scope. now trying to work it out this way
[08:49:15] <Eviltwin> gnarf: While I'm a born & raised Chicagoan, most of my time is spent in Urbana-Champaign these days
[08:49:45] <kborchers> Eviltwin: really ... i thought you worked at U of Chicago ... Urbana?
[08:50:04] <Eviltwin> I work remotely during the academic year
[08:50:09] <kborchers> aaahhhh
[08:50:12] <kborchers> gotcha
[08:50:20] <Eviltwin> They like me that much :D
[08:50:20] <gnarf> Eviltwin: my friend Tim lives in Champaign
[08:50:30] <gnarf> I'm in Rockford myself
[08:50:48] <kborchers> Eviltwin: that explains your ability to constantly help in here ;)
[08:50:56] <Eviltwin> Yup
[08:51:10] <andrew9183> http://jsbin.com/exokak/edit#javascript,html
[08:51:18] <andrew9183> how come both tabs return 'background' on click ?
[08:51:50] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: You didn't scope your vars
[08:51:53] <Eviltwin> So they're considered global
[08:52:11] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Throw var in front of the instantiations
[08:52:23] <Eviltwin> (the first time you use them)
[08:52:25] <nmee> Inside the success handler from a $.post call, can I somehow access $(this) from the context that called the $.post? Or pass it to the $.post success handler in an easy way?
[08:52:41] <Eviltwin> nmee: Either set the "context" setting of the $.ajax
[08:52:47] <Eviltwin> Or put it in a var outside the $.ajax call
[08:52:57] <Eviltwin> var foobar = this;
[08:53:02] <Eviltwin> Refer to foobar inside
[08:54:08] <orentanay> I have a page that contains an iFrame. I'm trying to call a jQuery function on the parent page from the iframe. But this is not working when the iframe url is a sub domain of the parent window url, and thought? here is what I'm trying to use: try { parent.$(parent.document).contactUsOverlayCloseDeActivate(); } catch(e) {}
[08:54:09] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Just so you know, you've done a couple things here that aren't considered good practices
[08:54:24] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: For one thing '[id*="tab"]' means '*[id*="tab"]'
[08:54:26] <nmee> Eviltwin: perfect, thanks!
[08:54:40] <Eviltwin> Which means it traverses every element inside there
[08:55:00] <Eviltwin> And then checks if their attrs
[08:55:03] <andrew9183> ah
[08:55:10] <Eviltwin> Meaning it's slow
[08:55:17] <Eviltwin> If you know the element type
[08:55:19] <Eviltwin> Throw that in front
[08:55:35] <andrew9183> k thanks!
[08:55:40] <andrew9183> any other ones ?
[08:55:44] <NoiseEee> does ui.sortable depend on the 'sortable' thing being <li>s or using <ul>s ?
[08:56:05] <Eviltwin> The other thing is sort of an unfortunate side effect of your arrangement
[08:56:10] <Eviltwin> Possibly unavoidable
[08:56:35] <Eviltwin> But when possible, it's better to cut apart and splice together IDs to find related elements
[08:56:44] <Eviltwin> And to use short DOM traversals instead
[08:56:47] <Eviltwin> But in this setup
[08:56:59] <Eviltwin> Since your tabs aren't linked to your content directly
[08:57:08] <Eviltwin> (i.e. not part of the same distinct parent)
[08:57:14] <Eviltwin> You'd have a hard time doing that
[08:57:17] <Eviltwin> So I'm going to let that one slide
[08:57:18] <andrew9183> yeah
[08:57:34] <Eviltwin> I guess see ?alert too
[08:57:34] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[08:57:45] <andrew9183> i should have used <ul>
[08:57:46] <gx> i'm trying to figure out how to refresh a page with some new GET variables, on click. what's the best method to do this?
[08:58:02] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Whole page? Part of a page?
[08:58:12] <Eviltwin> Err
[08:58:16] <gx> the whole page
[08:58:16] <Eviltwin> gx: Whole page? Part of a page?
[08:58:27] <Eviltwin> window.location = window.location
[08:58:29] <andrew9183> thanks Eviltwin
[08:58:45] <gx> that will just refresh the page?
[08:58:45] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Have you worked with Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools?
[08:59:00] <gx> i want to add some new get vars to the url as well
[08:59:27] <Eviltwin> window.location = "http://the.new.page/you/want?plus=vars"
[09:00:12] <bizzone_marc> if a button has an onclick param set, then I bind a click handler to that button, is there a way to find the result of the onclick param?
[09:00:15] <gx> ok, i get that much... but what i also want to do is detect what the current getvars are, and if they're one value, make them another
[09:00:29] <Eviltwin> gx: Look at window.location.search
[09:00:42] <gx> i have a list of "deals", and i'm making a button you can press that will sort by price ascending, and then on another click, descending
[09:00:45] <Eviltwin> bizzone_marc: Not directly
[09:00:51] <gx> ok, ill check that out
[09:01:06] <Eviltwin> gx: You could also see ?g tablesorter
[09:01:07] <bot-t> gx, jQuery plugin: Tablesorter 2.0 - http://tablesorter.com/
[09:01:12] <bizzone_marc> Eviltwin, thanks
[09:01:23] <gx> yeah, ive looked at that, it wont work for this particular site tho, thanks
[09:02:58] <mantas322> wassup with stuff starting with $ in jquery
[09:03:04] <mantas322> what kinda corky syntax is that
[09:03:15] <Eviltwin> Give an example
[09:03:45] <mantas322> $.ajax({
[09:03:58] <gx> Eviltwin how can i detect the current url? i want to do window.location = <currentURL>;
[09:04:02] <Eviltwin> So you can write jQuery.ajax({ instead
[09:04:09] <mantas322> $( appCache ).bind(
[09:04:18] <mantas322> No, I'm just talking smack :P
[09:04:19] <Eviltwin> Or jQuery("ul li")
[09:04:30] <Eviltwin> $ is a convenient alias for it
[09:04:30] <mantas322> i've never used jquery before this is my first day
[09:04:38] <Eviltwin> gx: window.location is the current URL
[09:04:41] <mantas322> :>
[09:04:55] <Eviltwin> If you set window.location, the browser is moved to that URL
[09:04:56] <gx> hmm, if i do window.location = window.location; it doesnt work though
[09:05:07] <Eviltwin> Try window.location = "" + window.location;
[09:05:15] <Eviltwin> That should work
[09:05:24] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ mantas322
[09:05:24] <bot-t> mantas322, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:05:30] <gx> nope, nothing
[09:05:34] <snover> window.location.reload guys
[09:05:43] <mantas322> Oh I know javascript
[09:05:44] <Eviltwin> snover: In some cases he's going to change it
[09:05:46] <mantas322> brah
[09:05:51] <gx> snover i want to change the url tho
[09:05:57] <gx> well, add getvars to it
[09:06:00] <snover> then set window.locaiton.href
[09:06:13] <gx> as well as detect what the current getvars are, and if they are case 1, change them to case 2
[09:06:29] <snover> then use window.location.replace
[09:06:30] <gx> i'm trying to find an example of this being done as a guide, coming up short
[09:07:17] <Eviltwin> mantas322: var z = "foo"; function x(y) { this[y](z); } x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[09:07:22] <Eviltwin> mantas322: What does that do? :P
[09:07:38] <mantas322> sets z to foo
[09:07:46] <Eviltwin> And then?
[09:07:49] <mantas322> makes a function x that accepts y as a param
[09:07:57] <Eviltwin> Good so far
[09:07:58] <mantas322> then some voodoo
[09:08:03] <mantas322> takes y
[09:08:20] <mantas322> apply something to somewhre
[09:08:36] <Eviltwin> So you don't know what the end result of that is
[09:08:46] <mantas322> foo?
[09:09:12] <orentanay> is Jquery capable of allowing a script from within an iframe to call a function from the parent window, even if they are different sub-domains? thanks.
[09:09:43] <Eviltwin> orentanay: Rather than $(parentDocument)... I think you need to do parentWindow.$(...)...
[09:10:14] <orentanay> This was my first attempt: try { parent.$(parent.document).contactUsOverlayCloseDeActivate(); } catch(e) {}
[09:10:32] <Eviltwin> contactUsOverlayCloseDeActivate is jQuery plugin?
[09:10:40] <orentanay> yes
[09:10:46] <orentanay> primative, but yes
[09:10:52] <Eviltwin> Why?
[09:11:55] <orentanay> no specific reason, should they just be regular old functions?
[09:12:02] <Eviltwin> Probably
[09:12:14] <orentanay> testing now, thanks.
[09:14:08] <cybersholt> anybody know why when i call getJSON sometimes i get a undefined mime type ? im forcing the correct headers
[09:15:30] <gx> Eviltwin i needed window.location = document.location.href;
[09:15:33] <gx> that works
[09:15:34] <gx> fyi
[09:15:42] <xckpd7> sorry I got booted so I'll ask my question again
[09:15:48] <xckpd7> question: inside of a form, whenever someone enters a field, I want to append information after the submit button in that same form, based on that specific input element. What's the best way to traverse that? It needs to be vanilla so it works with all different inputs in different forms
[09:15:56] <gx> so now i just need to figure out how to grab the get variables, do a little if/then, and then append them to the new url
[09:19:03] <Eviltwin> gx: see ?.deparam
[09:19:04] <bot-t> gx, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[09:19:07] <Eviltwin> gx: see ?g .deparam
[09:19:08] <bot-t> gx, Ben Alman  jQuery BBQ  Examples  jQuery.deparam - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[09:19:09] <Eviltwin> That
[09:19:22] <gx> i found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/439463/how-to-get-get-and-post-variables-with-jquery
[09:19:24] <gx> which seems to work
[09:19:34] <gx> creates a variable called $_GET
[09:19:48] <gx> and i can just access the variable by calling $_GET["price"]
[09:20:33] <SandmanNet> So, when using $.get("url", {properties}....);  <- I want to create the properties like a normal JS object first, but I can't seem to do it correctly. "var args = new Array(); args["id"] = myid; console.log(args)" gives me "[]"... what am I doing wrong?
[09:20:33] <quicksilver> gx it sounds like you're trying to learn PHP
[09:20:43] <SandmanNet> Trying to google javascript properties/associative arrays
[09:20:43] <quicksilver> this is not the right channel to teach you php :)
[09:20:55] <gx> the only thing im unsure of now is how to "replace" the get vars when i do window.location = document.location.href + $_GET["price"];
[09:21:15] <quicksilver> SandmanNet: args = {}; args.id = myid; or just args = { "id" : myid }
[09:21:17] <gx> instead of just appending the variable to the end, cuz i'll get http://site.com/?price=1&price=2 instead of just /?price=2
[09:21:27] <SandmanNet> quicksilver: Oh! I'll try it
[09:21:49] <gx> quicksilver: i know php, thanks bud... if you clicked on the example i showed you, you'd see that the function creates a variable called $_GET
[09:22:01] <SandmanNet> quicksilver: Thanks! Just a basic thing that totally flew past me
[09:22:26] <quicksilver> gx: oh, that's a bit nutty (using the PHP names in javascript!)
[09:22:37] <gx> yeah, whatever works though i guess
[09:22:56] <gx> i'll rename it getVariable[] for you ;)
[09:23:25] <SandmanNet> quicksilver: How would I populate args.id if "id" is the value of an array, like "args.parts[0] = parts[1];" <- error
[09:23:56] <quicksilver> SandmanNet: not to be rude, but these are not jQuery questions. Find yourself a good javascript book or tutorial.
[09:24:14] <snover> ?101
[09:24:14] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[09:24:41] <Eviltwin> I prever to direct people to see ?learn
[09:24:42] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:24:44] <SandmanNet> quicksilver: Indeed, I went to JS first, but realized I was dealing with a JQ function call, so I assumed it would be easier for you guys to get what I was on to, but I'll try in JS, thanks :)
[09:24:54] <PeterB> I've got a loop which stopPropagation() stops, but also breaks my code: any help please? http://jsbin.com/iyixos
[09:24:56] <Eviltwin> Because that MDN link has a bunch of resources including a link to eloquent
[09:25:28] <Eviltwin> PeterB: Don't bind listeners inside listeners
[09:25:45] <Eviltwin> Unless you're adding it to newly-created elements
[09:26:13] <PeterB> Eviltwin: use trigger instead?
[09:26:31] <PeterB> I need to check the radio button, and thought 'click' was the way to do that
[09:26:56] <Eviltwin> What?
[09:27:04] <Eviltwin> What's the goal?
[09:27:15] <Eviltwin> For the inner .click
[09:27:52] <mantas322> lol
[09:27:54] <mantas322> u know what
[09:28:01] <mantas322> I dont care for this exception 11 at all
[09:28:04] <mantas322> not 1 bit
[09:28:08] <PeterB> Eviltwin: so that the radio input gets checked
[09:28:16] <PeterB> and its value submitted when the form is submitted
[09:29:35] <Eviltwin> PeterB: http://jsbin.com/iyixos/2
[09:29:58] <Eviltwin> Do you know why there was a loop?
[09:30:30] <PeterB> Eviltwin: yes, because click() on the input bubbled up and fired .click() on test-button
[09:30:38] <Eviltwin> Yup
[09:30:50] <PeterB> I hoped catching and stopping propagation in the input would prevent it, but then the input never got checked :|
[09:30:55] <notbenh> is there a simple way to exclude a class in a selector or is grep going to be my best bet? I wanna do something like $('ul#menu li.!hidden')
[09:31:07] <Eviltwin> One solution for resolving loops like that it to communicate some data with the event
[09:31:28] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").bind("click", function(event, extraData) { alert(extraData) });
[09:31:35] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").trigger("click", "Hello, World!");
[09:31:43] <Eviltwin> Will cause an alert of "Hello, World!"
[09:31:45] <Eviltwin> If #foo exists
[09:31:52] <texinwien> I'm looking for tips on setting up QUnit testing on a JQuery Mobile project.
[09:32:08] <Eviltwin> So you can use that data as a flag to your handlers
[09:32:26] <PeterB> ah, and return false if the data says it's already been called?
[09:32:30] <Eviltwin> And have them opwerW ONSIRIONllt
[09:32:35] <Eviltwin> Woah
[09:32:38] <Eviltwin> And have them operate conditionally*
[09:32:45] <Eviltwin> Actually just return
[09:32:55] <Eviltwin> Just returning is equivalent to ignoring the eevent
[09:33:07] <Eviltwin> Where as returning false cancels the bubble and prevents the default
[09:33:17] <Eviltwin> (Obviously do that if that's your goal)
[09:33:23] <Eviltwin> But it's not really hands off
[09:33:24] <texinwien> Specifically, I'm trying to figure out how to trigger a pageinit event so that code bound to the event will be fired (and become testable)
[09:34:28] <gx> looks like i can use the query plugin: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object but how do i download it?
[09:34:56] <Eviltwin> gx: Scroll down to "View all releases"
[09:35:06] <Eviltwin> And click
[09:35:11] <gx> yeah, then it sends me to another page, that has the relaeses, but nowhere to download that i can find
[09:35:40] <cybersholt> it is confusing i hope they fix the plugins section  soon
[09:35:48] <PeterB> ok, thanks Eviltwin !
[09:37:08] <joshsmith> I'm trying to select text in an input on focus
[09:37:09] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/joshsmith/keVPf/
[09:37:24] <joshsmith> but it seems to select it and then unselect it immediately thereafter; any thoughts?
[09:37:51] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: I think you need to see ?.select
[09:37:52] <bot-t> joshsmith, .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[09:37:53] <Eviltwin> And what it does
[09:39:07] <joshsmith> I looked at that Eviltwin and I'm not sure it does what I want, but I've seen others implement it
[09:39:53] <joshsmith> for example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/480735/select-all-contents-of-textbox-when-it-receives-focus-javascript-or-jquery
[09:40:20] <LukeNukem> so i have a jquery function
[09:40:22] <Eviltwin> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/04/select-text-in-input-box-on-user-select.html
[09:40:25] <LukeNukem> how do i run it in a page?
[09:40:30] <LukeNukem> in <script> tags or?
[09:40:51] <Eviltwin> jQuery is JavaScript
[09:41:19] <cybersholt> :)
[09:41:20] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I know why it's happening
[09:41:21] <LukeNukem> ok well how do i run a function
[09:41:24] <LukeNukem> im using a plugin
[09:41:31] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/joshsmith/keVPf/1/
[09:41:43] <joshsmith> the mouseup is causing it to get unselected
[09:41:43] <LukeNukem> i tried in between script tags and i get an error saying it is not a function o.o
[09:42:04] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Alternatively, delay the selection: http://jsfiddle.net/keVPf/2/
[09:42:11] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: pastebin
[09:42:15] <joshsmith> yeah, I considered that
[09:42:27] <joshsmith> that's probably better, actually
[09:42:28] <joshsmith> thanks Eviltwin
[09:42:32] <Eviltwin> NP
[09:42:37] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/W6rDRbgq
[09:42:49] <LukeNukem> Error: $(".delete").jConfirmAction is not a function
[09:42:49] <LukeNukem> Source File: http://localhost/bb/forum.php
[09:42:49] <LukeNukem> Line: 20
[09:43:11] <Eviltwin> Which plugin defines that?
[09:43:39] <Eviltwin> And is it compatable with jQuery 1.4.2?
[09:43:46] <cybersholt> Luke i would use google fonts
[09:44:02] <cybersholt> thats what u r trying to do is call a custom font?
[09:44:13] <LukeNukem> no?
[09:44:40] <cybersholt> oh ok thought ya said line 20
[09:45:03] <LukeNukem> well thats the error from error console in firefox, it looks at view source
[09:45:08] <LukeNukem> the php tags are not rendered
[09:45:09] <cybersholt> my bad
[09:45:22] <cybersholt> yea i know
[09:45:26] <LukeNukem> its actually at line 28
[09:46:52] <cybersholt> can't really tell what it is from the source u posted try and post a demo @ jsfiddle.net
[09:47:48] <KWhat_Work> What is the correct way to get the document.body?  $('body') ?  $(document.body) ?
[09:47:56] <Eviltwin> $("body") is fine
[09:48:21] <Eviltwin> Internally it checks to see if the string exactly matches "body" and then proceeds with document.body
[09:48:28] <KWhat_Work> ahh ok thanks
[09:48:31] <Eviltwin> Doesn't try to search for it or anything
[09:49:14] <gnarf> yeah - $( document.body ) works too, but "body" is less typing ;)
[09:50:40] <cybersholt> heres an idea eviltwin.com jquery questions and answers $0.50 each lol
[09:51:18] <Eviltwin> Here's a better idea: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[09:51:28] <LukeNukem> cybersholt, ok the js file was not loaded properly, its loaded now :D
[09:51:31] <cybersholt> even better!!!
[09:51:58] <cybersholt> thats good Luke it always helps to double check
[09:52:32] <LukeNukem> firebug ftw
[09:52:48] <LukeNukem> but the plugin is not still doing what its supposed to be doing -_-
[09:52:49] <xckpd7> ftw - for the wimps
[09:53:24] <cybersholt> like i said its hard to debug just a raw paste like that jsfiddle is your friend
[09:53:54] <cybersholt> + seeing php reminds me i have other stuff to do lol
[10:22:44] <fatninja> how to make fancy box title show up ?
[10:22:51] <fatninja> I mean, above the opened fancy box
[10:25:09] <LukeNukem> fatninja, see if this helps
[10:25:38] <LukeNukem> <script>jQuery("<div'></div>").attr("id", "divMessage").attr("title", "TITLE_HERE").addClass("error_message_dialog").html('FANCY TEST').dialog({modal:true, resizable: false, height: 500, width: 600});</script>
[10:28:42] <fatninja> where did you get that from ?
[10:28:45] <fatninja> it makes no sense
[10:29:18] <LukeNukem> someone who knows jquery showed me :3
[10:29:27] <LukeNukem> you need jquery UI to use it
[10:32:07] <fatninja> lol..
[10:32:14] <fatninja> I've done it way way simpler
[10:34:19] <fatninja> in the css file
[10:36:10] <LukeNukem> fatninja, care to share?
[10:36:33] <LukeNukem> fatninja, that script i gave you was actually to echo out arrays from php :D
[10:36:38] <LukeNukem> it works with normal msgs too
[10:37:19] <fatninja> .fancybox-title-float {
[10:37:30] <fatninja> changed bottom: -20px to top: -25px
[10:37:36] <sako> hey guys whats a good way to get all input[name=person_first_name] but exclude any inputs where id matches *unreg*
[10:38:06] <sako> basically if there is any instance of unreg in the id, i don't want that element returned
[10:38:39] <z0n3d> the easiest way would be loop through them and check and make a new list
[10:40:02] <z0n3d> sako, .not()
[10:40:11] <sako> _zoggy_: thanks
[10:40:14] <sako> oops
[10:40:20] <sako> z0n3d: thanks
[10:44:31] <NackNick> does jquery not work for ie7 and 8?
[10:47:00] <shadykhan> does it matter if i print my resume out on normal paper or cardstock paper?
[10:49:16] <dabear> shadykhan: wait - you actually PRINT your resume?
[10:49:42] <dabear> I've been to tens of job interviews and never done that
[10:49:58] <nail_> hence the "tens of" ;)
[10:50:00] <shadykhan> yeah
[10:50:11] <xckpd7> dabear: it's normal
[10:50:12] <dabear> nope
[10:50:19] <shadykhan> its not really
[10:50:23] <dabear> actually they prefer emails
[10:50:30] <shadykhan> all my interviews they never asked me to print it out
[10:50:33] <shadykhan> this is my first
[10:50:47] <xckpd7> dabear: but when you come in for the actual interview, you are supposed to bring a printed copy so you can review it in an interview
[10:51:01] <xckpd7> as usually the employer isn't expected to memorize, nor have a computer in front of them in said interview
[10:51:11] <dabear> ahok. the usually print it for me if they need to do that
[10:51:14] <xckpd7> so you and him can go down the line and go over your experience...
[10:51:24] <shadykhan> so normal paper or cardstock? lol
[10:51:32] <xckpd7> shadykhan: just white printer paper
[10:51:50] <xckpd7> not lined....
[10:51:52] <sako> why wouldn't this be working? $('input[name=person_first_name]').not("input:regex(id,*unreg*)")
[10:51:57] <sako> can you not use :regex in not()?
[10:52:21] <danzik17> sako: where did you read that you could?  you can use ?filter for that
[10:52:22] <bot-t> sako, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:52:34] <sako> ah great
[10:52:34] <sako> thanks
[10:52:38] <shadykhan> also how should i bring my resume
[10:52:43] <shadykhan> should i get some folder thing
[10:55:32] <xmaddness> I just print them on regular paper
[10:55:37] <xmaddness> no folder
[10:55:45] <xmaddness> they get 2 sheets of paper and a staple
[10:56:43] <sako> danzik17: hmm that didn't seem to work either.. keeps complaining about regex not being a function
[10:58:29] <nail_> :regex is not part of stock jquery is it?
[10:58:36] <nail_> ?regex
[10:58:36] <bot-t> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I'll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
[10:59:10] <BillCriswell> nail_: Regular expressions are stock javascript so you can use it all you want with jquery.
[10:59:21] <nail_> BillCriswell: I meant the :regex selector
[10:59:31] <nail_> that sako is trying to use
[11:01:21] <BillCriswell> nail_: Got it. The only thing I can think of doing is using filter with a regex.
[11:02:44] <Danny_Joris> Hi all, I'm using jquery ajax. This is my response in the data var: https://skitch.com/dannyjoris/gaepw/d6theming   and this is my function: http://pastebin.com/vWMsCNSf  ... I should be able to print that html snippet using data.items, right? It's not working ...
[11:04:45] <nail_> sako: (and BillCriswell) if what you want is really input:regex(id,*unreg*) (which is not a valid regexp btw) you probably want [id~="unreg"]
[11:04:47] <NoiseEee> Danny_Joris: what does your console say?  is the ajax request being sent/received?
[11:05:06] <NoiseEee> Danny_Joris: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:05:36] <sako> nail_: thanks i just figured that out i was actually using id*=
[11:05:51] <sako> whats the diff between *= and ~=, let me look it up
[11:05:52] <BillCriswell> Danny_Joris: It might not be aware it's JSON data? I'd try setting the dataType to 'json' and see if that's different.
[11:06:39] <nail_> sako: err my bad, that's * not ~ :)
[11:06:54] <sako> oh ya ~= looks for words delimited by spaces, i need *= in this case as im doing [id*=_reg_]
[11:06:57] <sako> thanks!
[11:07:49] <Danny_Joris> BillCriswell: Yes !! that's it - thank you! :)
[11:08:03] <Danny_Joris> BillCriswell++
[11:08:40] <BillCriswell> Glad it worked.
[11:08:56] <BillCriswell> I'd definitely read through those slides that NoiseEee pointed out. Excellent stuff.
[11:10:55] <Danny_Joris> NoiseEee: yeah thanks for the slides
[11:21:26] <sako> BillCriswell: interesting, though if it's properly formatted json jQuery will usually know it came through as json?
[11:22:48] <NoiseEee> sako: usually depends on the headers of the server response
[11:22:59] <sako> i see, good to know
[11:23:06] <sako> should come in handy debugging in the future ;)
[11:23:35] <NoiseEee> "content-type: application/json" is a good header to use
[11:24:41] <xrated> If it's json
[11:24:49] <BillCriswell> I also think it has something to do with it now returning an array of JSON objects... but I could be completely wrong.
[11:25:14] <BillCriswell> I think it expects [{ "foo" : "bar" }] and not just { "foo" : "bar" }
[11:36:06] <Azareth> Hi
[11:36:52] <Azareth> is there a difference between $('my_link').click(function(){my_func()}) and $('my_link').click(my_func)
[11:37:08] <rknLA> Azareth: as written, only philosophically
[11:37:25] <rknLA> if there are arguments involved, it's a different story
[11:37:43] <Azareth> my_func does not accept any arguments
[11:37:54] <JAAulde> please refresh my memory...what are the preferred events for detecting mouse over and mouse out?
[11:37:56] <BillCriswell> Azareth: You don't need to have the function(){ my_fund() })
[11:38:19] <Azareth> JAAulde : hove and ...
[11:38:23] <Azareth> *hover
[11:38:25] <BillCriswell> You can just do (function() { /* The code inside my_func() */ })
[11:38:29] <Azareth> thanks rknLA & BillCriswell
[11:38:59] <Azareth> BillCriswell : I call my_func from 2 places that why I moved it to func
[11:39:09] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:40:04] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[11:40:34] <JAAulde> Azareth: hover is not an event. also, I would use the hover method, but I am delegating this behavior as the elements I am concerned about are transient
[11:40:49] <JAAulde> I can never remember whether I should use mouseover, mouseenter, etc
[11:41:05] <Azareth> sorry JAAulde my mistake
[11:41:06] <Azareth> is anyone here familiar with fullCalendar
[11:41:11] * JAAulde is
[11:42:29] <fission6> this doesnt seem to be working but feels correct - any ideas, http://dpaste.org/YP3AL/
[11:42:32] * JAAulde is familiar with fullCalendar, Azareth
[11:43:43] <Azareth> JAAulde : anyidea how I can reload the data and change the source variables after the calendar is initialized?
[11:43:51] <BFranks> Anyone good with arrays? http://jsfiddle.net/F9QQZ/9/   .. If you uncomment the second definition of 'acdata' the drop down works.. but with the JSON parse setup it doesn't work.. ? (Locally I'd get an auto-complete with the raw JSON text in it no some other variable from another JSFiddle project)
[11:44:13] <BFranks> er by 'drop down' I mean 'auto complete'
[11:45:02] <JAAulde> Azareth: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/ Look at the "Event Data" section -- the last 6 items on the list are methods you can call
[11:45:33] <Azareth> thanks JAAulde
[11:45:38] <JAAulde> yep
[11:45:52] <Lann> How come this always returns true even if $j(this).facebox was not defined?  $j.isFunction($j(this).facebox)
[11:46:55] <Emperorlou> does anyone have the Pretty Pie Menu download? the page is gone on the jquery site
[11:47:30] <BinaryKitten> what was the url Emperorlou?
[11:47:44] <Emperorlou> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ppmenu
[11:51:32] <Danny_Joris> this is a bit of a noob question, but how do I figure out what $_POST variable to use to capture this data in my php function? https://skitch.com/dannyjoris/gae9x/d6theming
[11:52:54] <xmaddness> could always echo $_REQUEST and see what you are getting back
[11:54:41] <Syco54645_work> how can i get the bottom right corner of a div?
[11:55:21] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: Absolute positioning.
[11:55:51] <Danny_Joris> xmaddness: it says undefined="undefined" ...
[11:56:16] <Danny_Joris> the response works though, but I'm not using anything that I posted...
[11:56:53] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i think i may have figured out how to do it. i wanted to use jquery to position something at the bottom right corner of an existing div
[11:57:10] <ravenzz> Danny_Joris var_dump($_POST); ?
[11:57:44] <ravenzz> maybe it should be lat_lons['something']
[11:57:59] <BillCriswell> Are you animating to the bottom right corner of a div or do you just need it to be there
[11:58:01] <BillCriswell> ?
[11:58:25] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i just need it to be there
[11:58:53] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: and to update as the window changes size too i guess
[11:59:15] <Syco54645_work> but first just hhave it there, i guess i can get the top with offset then add the height to that to get the bottom
[11:59:22] <Syco54645_work> then left with the width for the right
[11:59:27] <Syco54645_work> thus giving me the bottom corner
[11:59:31] <BillCriswell> put position: relative on the parent <div> then on the element inside do position: absolute; bottom: 0; right: 0;
[11:59:47] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i need to do it with jquery
[12:00:51] <BillCriswell> $element.css({ position: "absolute", right: 0, left: 0 }) you mean?
[12:01:08] <BillCriswell> right: 0; bottom: 0 * i meant
[12:02:09] <BillCriswell> Confusing syntaxes on myself haha.
[12:02:23] <BillCriswell> $element.css({ position: "absolute", right: 0, bottom: 0 }); is correct.
[12:02:42] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i suppose that would work but was asked to place it based on the current bottom right corner using jquery
[12:02:54] <Syco54645_work> i like your method better
[12:03:22] <Emperorlou> I'm hoping for some api documentation on the Pretty Pie Menu...or the original download
[12:03:38] <Emperorlou> the jquery site just shows it as "Page Not Found"  :(
[12:03:48] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: I think I'm missing something you said.
[12:04:18] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: im probably not explaining it well
[12:05:15] <xsamurai> Is there a plugin that plays nicer with custom css errors on forms aside from jquery validate
[12:06:29] <BillCriswell> Syco54645_work: Do you have an empty <div></div> that you need to insert this positioned div into?
[12:07:09] <makeshiftwings> Hello everyone! Looking for a little help. I am trying to create a web page that shows twitter feeds for various people all on one page. Think little different modules that show the last, let's say, 3 feeds for an individual. Then that module would be tiled, the only thing changing is the twitter account. Can anyone point me in the right direction to achieve this. Any input would be greatly...

[12:20:02] * Lann flips out at jquery
[12:20:29] <Lann> i have a function getting defined multiple times at document.ready :-(. I can't stop it
[12:25:06] <nicholasschulz> whats wrong with this: $("#addImagetoAd").click( function () { alert(Hello); });
[12:25:34] <nicholasschulz> I get this error : Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[12:25:51] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: quote the "hello"
[12:26:03] <BillCriswell> It might be the space after function.
[12:26:05] <BillCriswell> Oh.. or that.
[12:26:22] <nicholasschulz> The quote didn't work
[12:26:39] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:27:15] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: $("#addImagetoAd").click( function (){ console.log( "hello" ); } );
[12:27:46] <nicholasschulz> skamikaze: so now i can't use alert anymore?
[12:27:59] <skamikaze> you can it's alert what suxx
[12:28:00] <skamikaze> :)
[12:28:50] <nicholasschulz> well, if its the alert thingy thats doing no good I'm out of trouble :-) Not supposed to be alert there, but just used it because its fast
[12:29:17] <skamikaze> console.log/warn/trace/dir is a lot faster
[12:29:21] <jspath> Is there a known issue measuring the height of checkboxes via .height()? http://jsfiddle.net/TSevU/1/
[12:30:52] <nicholasschulz> Well, the console.log doesn't work either kamikaze, so something else must be wrong. But from the debugger i know its on that specific line
[12:32:23] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: you need firebug/chrome console turned on
[12:33:05] <nicholasschulz> i have the chrome console. it says: "testdrive.php:386 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier"
[12:33:07] <skamikaze> firefox: 12 (you maybe have to install the debugger first) or chrome : control + shift + j
[12:33:24] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: paste your real code please
[12:33:31] <nicholasschulz> ok 2 sec
[12:34:35] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: will you read this please? ;) http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:35:18] <nicholasschulz> i read it with no result. i have debugging tools if thats what you're trying to say?
[12:35:31] <nicholasschulz> http://jsfiddle.net/FQjrP/
[12:35:34] <skamikaze> you read it in 5 seconds?
[12:35:43] <skamikaze> use right key to slide
[12:36:44] <skamikaze> firebug would tell you that $ is not defined
[12:37:13] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Doesn't seem like you have jQuery included.
[12:37:29] <BillCriswell> When I choose jQuery from the left side it works fine.
[12:37:38] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/FQjrP/1/
[12:37:43] <nicholasschulz> hehe, http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php
[12:37:53] <nicholasschulz> click "Sell" and continue to the last step
[12:37:59] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: don't be lazy
[12:38:26] <BillCriswell> $("#addImagetoAd").click( function ()Â { warn( "hello" ); })
[12:38:26] <eddiemonge> nicholasschulz: no need to click
[12:38:37] <eddiemonge> ^^
[12:38:38] <nicholasschulz> How come it works in jsfiddle and not on my page?
[12:38:58] <BillCriswell> It's the bad character in the source.
[12:38:58] <eddiemonge> because you are pasting in an invalid character and jsfiddle strips it out
[12:39:23] <nicholasschulz> oh, ok. How do I know what gets stripped out eddiemonge?
[12:39:43] <BillCriswell> You should see it if you're pasting it in there... It's not a lot of code to look at.
[12:39:49] <eddiemonge> nicholasschulz: why do you have that character in there? where did it come from?
[12:40:23] <nicholasschulz> eddiemonge: What character? Im still not sure what is wrong.
[12:40:25] <eddiemonge> just delete it
[12:40:33] <eddiemonge> Â
[12:40:50] <eddiemonge> $("#addImagetoAd").click( function ()Â { warn( "hello" ); })
[12:40:57] <eddiemonge> function ()Â { }
[12:41:06] <eddiemonge> ()Â {}
[12:41:10] <BillCriswell> () Â {}
[12:41:13] <BillCriswell> damn, beat me to it.
[12:41:14] <eddiemonge> Â
[12:41:17] <eddiemonge> see it now?
[12:41:23] <skamikaze> :)
[12:41:35] <ch3mical> I believe that's a carriage return badly translated from a non-UTF charset, just FYI
[12:41:50] <nicholasschulz> it doesn't show here :-p
[12:41:59] <nicholasschulz> or am i being blind…..
[12:42:15] <ch3mical> nicholasschulz, if you're not using a UTF charset, you won't see it
[12:42:16] <BillCriswell> View Source in your browser, ignore your text editor.
[12:42:34] <ch3mical> nicholasschulz, switch to UTF-8 :)
[12:42:52] <eddiemonge> nicholasschulz: $("#addImagetoAd").click( function () { warn( "hello" ); })
[12:42:57] <nicholasschulz> Okay I can see it it the source
[12:42:58] <eddiemonge> just copy and paste that
[12:43:52] <BillCriswell> You could try to "viewing invisibles" to see if it's there in your editor. ( maybe? )
[12:44:54] <eddiemonge> or switch to a real text editor? what are you using?
[12:45:58] <nicholasschulz> I am using Coda on my Macbook. I got rid of the unknown character - still not working… Annoying.
[12:46:32] <eddiemonge> likes fine now
[12:46:35] <BillCriswell> nicholasschulz: Weird... Do they have settings for saving files you can change?
[12:47:10] <nicholasschulz> Now I get this error though: "Uncaught ReferenceError: warn is not defined"
[12:48:12] <BillCriswell> console.warn('Hello')
[12:48:13] <skamikaze> nicholasschulz: use console.warn instead (with debugger turned on)
[12:48:20] <nicholasschulz> BillCriswell: I would be weird if this changed overnight because everything I did yesterday worked fine...
[12:49:55] <BillCriswell> nicholasschulz: Did you upload the file and download it or something that might effect it in that way?
[12:50:22] <Syco54645_work> BillCriswell: i got it working with jquery for the most part
[12:50:40] <nicholasschulz> BillCriswell: Nope, just logged into my FTP server as usual and it won't cooperate anymore....
[12:50:45] <Mopsy> Howdy
[12:51:00] <eddiemonge> im still waiting for the jquery part of all this
[12:51:09] <Mopsy> I actually came on to discuss jquery
[12:51:18] <Mopsy> I'm having a problem with the parents() function
[12:51:25] <Mopsy> in that I can't get it to work
[12:51:34] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do with it?
[12:51:38] <Mopsy> I'm trying to use the examples found here:
[12:51:39] <BillCriswell> Mopsy: Use closest() instead.
[12:51:39] <Mopsy> http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[12:51:52] <Mopsy> Does closest go all the way up?
[12:51:56] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:52:03] <Eviltwin> Mopsy: What are you trying to do?
[12:52:14] <Mopsy> Okay, thanks, I'll look up the documentation on closest
[12:52:17] <nicholasschulz> If I replace "alert" or whatever with "$("#somediv").hide();"  it works, so something is up with alert or whatever. Not important since Im not using that.
[12:52:17] <Mopsy> and Eviltwin
[12:52:29] <eddiemonge> closest stops at the nearest matching selector
[12:52:35] <Mopsy> I have a bunch of tables and rows being output onto a page by json
[12:52:37] <eddiemonge> parents goes all the way up the DOM tree
[12:52:41] <Mopsy> it's for the channels in a voice server
[12:52:52] <Mopsy> however, there are a LOT of channels
[12:53:06] <Mopsy> because the channels and information are being updated via AJAX reading that JSON
[12:53:25] <Mopsy> it's difficult to collapse the channels, probably impossible with standard CSS, which I'm no stranger to
[12:53:32] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: lets start with your question. what specifically is not working in what context? a demo helps see ? demo
[12:53:32] <bot-t> Mopsy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:53:37] <Mopsy> However, I changed the PHP to give users in channels a "user" class
[12:54:00] <Mopsy> Okay, give me a second to get it back to where I had it
[12:54:35] <Mopsy> http://kefkaspeak.emulysianfields.com/
[12:54:43] <Mopsy> Basically, I want channels without users in them to collapse
[12:54:49] <Mopsy> however, there is no CSS parent selector
[12:54:49] <nicholasschulz> How do I make a div slide in sideways? Is there something like slideRight :-P ?
[12:54:49] <Eviltwin> Mopsy: Let's say I have <div><ul><li><span><b><a id="#foo">Hi</a></b></span></li></ul></div>
[12:55:00] <Mopsy> I *have* given the users a .user class
[12:55:01] <Eviltwin> And I do $("#foo").magicFunction("li")
[12:55:05] <Eviltwin> What do you want to be in that colleciton?
[12:55:08] <Eviltwin> collection*
[12:55:10] <Eviltwin> What should be selected?
[12:55:28] <eddiemonge> nicholasschulz: look at jqueryui
[12:55:38] <Mopsy> Basically, everything above it, to the top
[12:55:43] <Mopsy> the best solution i can think of for my problem
[12:55:54] <Mopsy> is to display:none the divs/table elements
[12:56:12] <Mopsy> and then re-enable display of elements with users in them, all the way up so that they display
[12:56:14] <BillCriswell> Mopsy: .user:empty { display: none; } maybe?
[12:56:41] <Mopsy> I did not think of that selector, however, .user is *only* for users that display
[12:56:48] <Mopsy> there aren't ever empty .user elements
[12:56:58] <Mopsy> there are elements above them lacking a user
[12:57:05] <Mopsy> however, that wouldn't collapse the channels above them
[12:57:14] <Mopsy> that would only collapse the lowest levels, were it to work
[12:57:33] <Mopsy> I'm happy to pursue that path if you think it more wise than what I'm trying, though I don't yet see how it's feasible for my case
[12:57:42] <velts> what is the best way to append something to the same location where the code is being executed
[12:57:47] <velts> without using document.write
[12:57:58] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: heres your code in fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/Qcfb3/
[12:58:21] <fris> is the best way to get the base url for any url on the domain document.location.hostname?
[12:58:23] <Eviltwin> Mopsy: So $("#foo").magicFunction("li") should be [ a, b, span, li, ul, div] or [ li, ul, div] or [ ul, div ]?
[12:58:27] <Mopsy> Thanks. This seems liek a neat little tool.
[12:58:30] <Eviltwin> Or something else?
[12:58:41] <Mopsy> Give me a second to take that all in.
[12:59:00] <eddiemonge> velts: the best way would be to give it an id and append to that id and concat the scripts
[12:59:09] <eddiemonge> velts:  but it sounds more like you are making ads
[12:59:11] <Mopsy> Eviltwin, what do you mean by b?
[12:59:21] <Mopsy> like, bold...?
[12:59:42] <Mopsy> I don't believe I have any <b> tags in there, I try to use strong if I absolutely can't use css
[12:59:46] <Eviltwin> <div><ul><li><span><b><a id="#foo">Hi</a></b></span></li></ul></div>
[12:59:52] <Mopsy> oh, right, sorry
[12:59:54] <Mopsy> I forgot your example
[12:59:56] <jedimind> oh dear that's a lot of tags
[13:00:05] <Mopsy> the first option, eviltwin
[13:00:09] <Mopsy> a, b, span, li, ul, div
[13:00:28] <Mopsy> I intend to use display none, and I want a cascading upward effect to re-enable display for parents of .user
[13:00:35] <Mopsy> or in this case, #foo
[13:01:25] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: what are you trying to do? in one tweet or less
[13:01:41] <Mopsy> I'm using the example found on the parents() page
[13:01:43] <Mopsy> http://kefkaspeak.emulysianfields.com/test.php
[13:01:55] <Mopsy> The code for parents() outright doesn't seem to work for me
[13:02:04] <Mopsy> I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
[13:03:01] <Mopsy> I'm using Firefox, for what it's worth.
[13:03:04] <Mopsy> 9.0.1
[13:03:32] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: no, dont give solutions. give your problem. what is your end goal?
[13:04:08] <Mopsy> With the example I've given, at http://kefkaspeak.emulysianfields.com/test.php , I'd like to make all parents of the element "item-a" have red for background-color
[13:04:10] <eddiemonge> and in that test case you need see ? ready
[13:04:10] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:04:29] <eddiemonge> and its going to make the page red with what you have
[13:04:40] <Mopsy> it's doing nothing, with what I have
[13:05:16] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: thats because you are trying to change the background of elements that dont exist. again, see ? ready
[13:05:16] <bot-t> Mopsy, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:05:39] <Mopsy> What do you mean by "see ? ready"
[13:05:39] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:05:42] <Mopsy> oh
[13:06:03] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/w4ZXw/1/
[13:06:45] <Mopsy> Thank you, I'll try to figure this out.
[13:07:06] <eddiemonge> sorry, that was normalized. this is your example with a .ready() block added http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/w4ZXw/2/
[13:07:33] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: is this what you want it to look like: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/w4ZXw/3/
[13:07:57] <Mopsy> No
[13:08:03] <Mopsy> The page where it is all red is what I want
[13:08:12] <Mopsy> I indeed meant to use parents()
[13:08:16] <eddiemonge> like the whole page?
[13:08:22] <Mopsy> Right
[13:08:27] <eddiemonge> why?
[13:08:27] <manisabri> Hi ... specifying the width option of the jquery ui dialog change the dialog site but the Iframe inside the dialog is smaller than the dialog width (near half the size)... with no width option there is no problem.. any idea?
[13:08:36] <Mopsy> I'm using it as a proof of concept in order to use display, as I explained earlier
[13:08:38] <manisabri> site=size
[13:08:59] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: then why not make the page red to begin with?
[13:09:03] <Mopsy> In your examples, though, I don't see a ready block?
[13:09:15] <Mopsy> http://kefkaspeak.emulysianfields.com/
[13:09:20] <Mopsy> That is my actual problem
[13:09:28] <BillCriswell> $(function() { }); is the ready block.
[13:09:28] <Mopsy> I want to collapse channels that don't have users in them
[13:09:40] <Mopsy> @BillCriswell, Okay, thanks, I understand now.
[13:09:56] <eggnogg> I have something like this: $window.resize( positionColumns ); var positionColumns = $.debounce(500, false, function(){ etc..
[13:10:07] <madsara> Hey, is there an easy way to JSON encode an array in jquery?
[13:10:08] <eggnogg> any way I can call the positionColumns function standalone?
[13:10:15] <madsara> I'm thinkint there is.
[13:10:25] <BillCriswell> Mopsy: Can you just use .user:empty { display: none; } ?
[13:10:31] <Mopsy> @eddiemonge The method I chose was to hide subchannels with display:none, and then unhide parents of any element with .user
[13:11:15] <Mopsy> BillCriswell I answered that earlier, I don't think so, considering that I'm not checking for empty .user classes, I'm checking for elements that don't contain an element with .user
[13:11:21] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: i like how you are loading everything into a table column
[13:11:25] <eddiemonge> for no reason
[13:11:49] <Mopsy> I did not design that; I don't use tables generally
[13:11:57] <Mopsy> mumble-reader, it's on google code
[13:12:18] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: do you want channels with no users to be visible or not even be in the list? like not toggle-able?
[13:12:19] <Mopsy> I've modified the PHP, CSS, HTML, icons, and javascript up until now to get it doing what I wanted
[13:12:43] <Mopsy> I want them to collapse up to the top-most channel that is sibling to any channel with a user as some descendent
[13:13:01] <Chopps> anyone here has used jqgrid??
[13:13:17] <eddiemonge> Mopsy:  any chance you could mark up what you want the end result to look like?
[13:13:38] <Mopsy> @eddiemonge Basically, I want it to function like the application. Consider: http://mpql.net/i/p/ss/screen_2012-01-09_1180.png
[13:14:56] <Mopsy> In any event, the ready block seems to have me understanding this code finally
[13:15:00] <Mopsy> I'm new to jquery.
[13:15:05] <eddiemonge> i can tell
[13:15:17] <Mopsy> I apologize for the difficulty.
[13:15:21] <eddiemonge> that mumble plugin could use a lot of optimization
[13:15:24] <Mopsy> Thanks for taking the time.
[13:15:27] <Mopsy> Absolutely
[13:15:39] <Mopsy> But I generally want to get things working the way I want them to before optimizing
[13:15:44] <eddiemonge> i would suggest you look at templating to output what you want. it will make things easier
[13:16:11] <eddiemonge> and add/remove classes instead of directly manipulating .css()
[13:16:13] <Mopsy> It has a lot to do with DBUS and ICE, and I don't know those well enough to make my own from scratch. So, I'm settling for modifying what appears to be the standard. Why re-inevtn the wheel?
[13:16:23] <whoever> i am tring to assign $(".toggleSubDiv:visible").each(function(){ $(this).attr("id")}) to a var and alert the var and all i get on the alert is[object] . can someone asist
[13:16:49] <Mopsy> Well, the only method I can think of for adding/removing classes would be to give parents that had no child user a separate class
[13:17:00] <Mopsy> however, there doesn't seem to be a method for that with the script I'm working on
[13:17:13] <Mopsy> that gets into PHP, though, and I don't want to take this channel off-topic
[13:17:19] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: if you are getting json, work with that
[13:17:57] <eddiemonge> whoever: what do you want that variable for?
[13:18:38] <whoever> eddiemonge: so that i can set the elemend visible or not
[13:19:17] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: It's PHP outputting as json, and it's doing it largely thanks to ICE. Like I said, the Mumble DBUS/ICE doesn't really provide a method for discerning which channels have users as descendents, and I'm not too handy with JSON
[13:20:16] <eddiemonge> whoever: ok so what do you need to save the id for? toggle the visiblity in the loop
[13:21:06] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: what is DBUS/ICE? JSON is just "objects" in js notation
[13:21:55] <whoever> eddiemonge: just to make refering to it an using the id a little easier than having to use a long string every time
[13:23:21] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: ICE is something that talks to the Mumble binary, and it uses DBUS to get information from that program and communicate that to PHP, which outputs it as JSON. I'm sure you're right regarding messing with the JSON, but the whole javascript area is something I'm generally inept with. I'd love to know more, but I don't. I really need to just sit down and learn absolutely everything...
[13:23:24] <Mopsy> ...about javascript and its kin. But for now, this is a bit over my head.
[13:23:27] <eddiemonge> whoever: can you give an example? i have a feeling what you are doing could be optimized
[13:24:08] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: is this for a client or personal use?
[13:24:54] <eggnogg> Anyone know of a good/recent implementation of debounce?
[13:25:20] <Eviltwin> eggnogg: It's called "debounce"
[13:25:30] <whoever> eddiemonge: i have getting the id of the visible dive and then in an if block hiding or showing it
[13:25:46] <Eviltwin> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-debounce/
[13:26:06] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: It's for personal use. It's just for a forum I run.
[13:26:25] <eggnogg> thanks
[13:26:26] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: I enjoy coding, though, I just need to spend more time learning some of the languages.
[13:26:54] <eddiemonge> whoever: why cant you do the if block in the each statement?
[13:27:01] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: link to the site again?
[13:27:03] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Either way, I appreciate the help you've given. I'm going to work on getting what I want to happen to work.
[13:27:14] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: http://kefkaspeak.emulysianfields.com/
[13:28:10] <whoever> eddiemonge: just thaught that it might be less code the other way
[13:28:36] <eddiemonge> whoever: not really, most likely
[13:29:40] <Mopsy> Our of curiosity, would $('.class').parents().css('attribute', 'value!important'); work, or even be necessary?
[13:29:43] <Mopsy> Out of*
[13:29:52] <eddiemonge> eww no
[13:30:10] <Mopsy> no it wouldn't work, or no it wouldn't be necessary?
[13:30:19] <Mopsy> I don't intend to *use* this code, I just found myself wondering.
[13:34:15] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: geez that is a lot of nested channels
[13:34:30] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Yeah, I know.
[13:35:07] <ProLoser|Work> hello people, i am trying to figure something out: http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/nTzRA/7/
[13:35:27] <ProLoser|Work> try typing something into an editor and then moving the cursor focus to another editor
[13:35:31] <ProLoser|Work> then check your console log
[13:35:38] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: any chance you can easily/quickly see which has users?
[13:35:44] <ProLoser|Work> what i don't understand is why element.html() shows me something different from element
[13:35:50] <ProLoser|Work> why is the actual element empty?
[13:35:58] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: I don't understand what you're asking.
[13:36:28] <eddiemonge> which channel actually has a user right now?
[13:36:28] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Seems like an issue with this angularjs
[13:36:38] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Chat
[13:36:55] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Toward the bottom.
[13:37:20] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: I have them a class called "user"
[13:37:29] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: gave*
[13:37:30] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: what makes you think that?
[13:39:35] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: 'Cause we don't speak angular here which means you'd have to go somewhere else: P
[13:41:35] <ProLoser|Work> but you speak jquery
[13:41:49] <ProLoser|Work> i'm using jquery to set the contents
[13:42:01] <Mopsy> brb
[13:42:08] <ProLoser|Work> i was curious if you might know why .html() gives me different results than echoing the el itself
[13:42:17] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Did you look at this? http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:onchange_callback
[13:42:24] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[13:42:32] <Eviltwin> Did you see how it's different?
[13:42:44] <ProLoser|Work> they used alert?
[13:43:11] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: because .html() isnt what you think it is. its a custom function looks like
[13:43:21] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/nTzRA/8/
[13:44:38] <ProLoser|Work> it's not the jquery defined html() fn?
[13:44:52] <eddiemonge> no

[13:46:00] <sarspazam> i've no idea
[13:46:07] <Mopsy> NoiseEee: Nope, sorry.
[13:46:08] <rupl> NoiseEee: I need frog porn, got any frog porn?
[13:46:19] <sarspazam> it looks like it was designed by a child
[13:46:27] <Eviltwin> Who wants frog porn?
[13:46:30] <sarspazam> hopefully the videos dont say the same
[13:46:38] <Mopsy> Also, back. XD
[13:46:48] <Eviltwin> I'm opening them one by one but they're all bringing me to the same page
[13:47:22] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: Damn. I'll never understand the internet if that's what's happening.
[13:49:18] <Mopsy> Nice. XD
[13:49:59] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: Anything yet?
[13:50:04] <Patabugen> What's the difference between using $('#button').click() and $('#button').trigger('click') ?
[13:50:18] <eddiemonge> Patabugen: one function call
[13:50:44] <Patabugen> trigger() just called .clck() ?
[13:50:51] <eddiemonge> Patabugen: read the .click() api page see ? click
[13:50:51] <bot-t> Patabugen, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[13:51:52] <Patabugen> Ah yeah, I read the Trigger() page but not the click)= one.
[13:51:54] <Patabugen> fair enough, so trigger() is marginly more efficient but there's no functional different
[13:52:33] <eddiemonge> right.
[13:52:46] <badbandit> hello, is it acceptable to load javascript/jquery at the bottom of my page inside just a <script> tag?
[13:53:01] <eddiemonge> badbandit: yes. maybe. depends.
[13:53:01] <badbandit> will it not run if I dont include the $(document).ready(function()...?
[13:53:43] <eddiemonge> badbandit: you should always include the .ready block but if its at the end of your page, you may not need it
[13:54:08] <Patabugen> badbandit: It'll run but it might run before the DOM is properly loaded
[13:55:05] <Lann> arrrgh!
[13:55:16] <badbandit> dev-www.sosd.com, I wrote a small script that sizes the menu button padding properly to fill the parent container in the nav, problem is that you could see it being resized, so I set it to hidden and then threw the code at the bototm of the page and also set the css back to visible at the end
[13:55:33] <badbandit> pretty sure this can be better though and not sure if im loading the js properly
[13:55:49] <Lann> i'm defining a function with jquery. $('#something').facebox more than once. This results in multiple executions of the facebox function when it is called. How can i prevent them from stacking?
[13:56:08] <Lann> it seems to be executing them in a similar way as stacked binded events
[13:56:18] <eddiemonge> badbandit: can you make a simplified demo please?
[13:56:22] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Actually, I'm still having trouble. I think it has something to do with the content being loaded dynamically. If I try the same exact code on a page where I've copied the content statically, it works. When I try to apply that code to the stuff loaded from JSON, it doesn't work.
[13:56:46] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: you probably need  see ? delegate
[13:56:46] <bot-t> Mopsy, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:56:48] <badbandit> http://jsfiddle.net/anrL8/4/ was what i doodled at home yesterday
[13:56:57] <badbandit> but of course my work nav is like 3 layers deep
[13:57:05] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: I'll look into it, thanks
[13:57:30] <badbandit> ended up using outerWidth() to get the list item width bc the anchors have borders set
[13:57:53] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: Actually, it says delegate has been superseded by .on() - should I try going with that intsead?
[13:57:59] <MoTiOnXml> this selector: *[data-jsonID!=''] doesn't filter correctly; it still selects nodes with an empty attribute of data-jsonID - anyone?
[13:58:12] <MoTiOnXml> is it the "-" that throws off the parser?
[13:58:34] <eddiemonge> Mopsy: if you are using 1.7 yes. delegate is to get you the idea
[13:58:48] <Mopsy> eddiemonge: I am. And okay, thanks.
[14:00:02] <MoTiOnXml> anyone on the selector above?
[14:00:06] <Mopsy> see ? events
[14:00:06] <bot-t> Docs: Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/Events/
[14:00:16] <MoTiOnXml> i can't figure out why *[data-jsonID!=''] still selects empty attributes
[14:00:26] <MoTiOnXml> i'm not using a meta-character
[14:00:26] <BillCriswell> MoTiOnXml: You might need to use filter()
[14:00:38] <MoTiOnXml> BillCriswell: hmm
[14:00:58] <MoTiOnXml> BillCriswell: because it doesn't support empty strings? it works with other values
[14:02:37] <BillCriswell> $('*[data-jsonID]').filter(function() return $(this).attr('data-jsonID').length > 0 ? true : false; }).magic(); maybe?
[14:03:28] <MoTiOnXml> BillCriswell: yea, that's an option but i'm surprised slick doesn't support this
[14:05:10] <BillCriswell> MoTiOnXml: Yeah, a little weird that is isn't working.
[14:05:27] <eddiemonge> badbandit: why do you get the padding just to change it again?
[14:05:28] <MoTiOnXml> we must be missing something
[14:05:40] <BillCriswell> Try a \ before the - /
[14:05:46] <MoTiOnXml> hang on ..
[14:05:49] <badbandit> bc as a fall back I have an initial padding set
[14:05:53] <BillCriswell> the / should be a ?
[14:05:55] <badbandit> that will look "ok" in most browsers
[14:06:14] <whoever> ephemerian: i am tring to use fadeout fade in ,is there a predefind function that will wait untill fade out is amost complete before fadein will start or do i need an if to check display of element
[14:06:17] <MoTiOnXml> BillCriswell: ?!
[14:06:27] <badbandit> I have to then get the total width of the existing list/anchors and subtract it from the total container width
[14:07:01] <eddiemonge> badbandit: whats wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/anrL8/6/
[14:07:05] <badbandit> then divide the remainder by the number of list items which gives the amount of pixels that need to be added to each item in order for them to all add up to the total container width
[14:07:23] <badbandit> dividing that by 2 gives what to add to each side of padding
[14:07:33] <MoTiOnXml> BillCriswell: no dice, also according to docs it wouldn't make a difference - but thanks
[14:08:36] <BillCriswell> $("div[data\-jsonID!='']") works for me...
[14:09:03] <Eviltwin> $("div[data\-jsonID]")
[14:09:08] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:09:15] <binni> doesn't "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'sortable'" mean that I'm missing the Jquery UI sortable code?
[14:09:44] <Eviltwin> Probably
[14:09:53] <Dave_Stein> heyo guys i haven't seen in a while
[14:10:02] <BillCriswell> Actually it works without the \ as well.
[14:10:05] <eddiemonge> badabim: yes no?
[14:10:07] <Dave_Stein> i have returned with a fun bug that i think is IE8's fault but i found it on jquery
[14:10:08] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/xKzyV/2/
[14:10:45] <eddiemonge> badabim: oops sorry not for you
[14:10:57] <badabim> np
[14:11:29] <Eviltwin> I blame IE
[14:11:38] <Dave_Stein> im chanign it to a for loop to do the same blame
[14:11:57] * WebDragon just ran into an unusually high amount of dislike for jquery (vs mootools/dojo) over in #css just now and is somewhat perplexed by this attitude
[14:12:45] <BillCriswell> Haters gonna hate.
[14:14:56] <andornaut> Can anyone recommend a simple html5 multiple-file uploader plugin w/ progress bar support?
[14:15:44] <NoiseEee> andornaut: really, take the 20 minutes and follow a tutorial and make one yourself
[14:15:54] <jeffsmykil> is length the best way to find if a span has text in it?
[14:16:06] <NoiseEee> it'll be less than searching for a plugin, implementing it, working it out, etc... imho anyways andornaut
[14:16:09] <andornaut> NoiseEee: yeah, i think i'll do that
[14:16:36] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: no
[14:16:53] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: care to enlighten me sir
[14:18:21] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/xKzyV/5/ yeah its def IE8 but I actually get the bug in IE9, in IE8 mode, on Windows 7 when I use native JS
[14:18:32] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: If I use $.map, I only see the bug in actual IE8
[14:18:35] <Dave_Stein> weird eh
[14:18:47] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: Changing the keys while iterating should not cause the set you're iterating over to change
[14:18:55] <Eviltwin> Or the iterator to change
[14:19:10] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: Yeah, but it looks like, based on the results, that jq knew about the IE bug and got it fixed, but not for actual IE8
[14:19:13] <Dave_Stein> within .map
[14:19:38] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: are you trying to find out if there is just text, no text, or other spans and text inside or anything inside?
[14:20:09] <jeffsmykil> text inside the span
[14:20:20] <jeffsmykil> content really i suppose
[14:20:24] <jeffsmykil> but has to go down to text
[14:21:53] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: if($.trim(el.text())=='') { //oops, no text content
[14:22:44] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: I think I'll post this one as a possible jq bug, what do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/xKzyV/8/
[14:23:27] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: Not sure I understand
[14:23:56] <jeffsmykil> like where my selector goes
[14:25:58] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: Try a for(var k in x)
[14:26:25] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: "el" is a reference to your <span>,  ie:  var el = $)
[14:26:35] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: "el" is a reference to your <span>,  ie:  var el = $('span .withSelector')
[14:26:47] <jeffsmykil> ah
[14:27:50] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: still no good.... my solution for time being is var copy = $.extend({}, x ) and then iterate over copy but manipulate x
[14:28:02] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: Right, so it's an IE bug, not a jQuery one
[14:28:41] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: correct, if jQuery isn't trying to fix it through abstraction. if jQuery did nothing to fix it, how do you explain map working correctly for Windows IE9's IE8 mode
[14:28:54] <Dave_Stein> because that's the most confusing part for me
[14:28:55] <Eviltwin> Wait, it does work correctly?
[14:29:08] <Dave_Stein> in IE9's IE8 mode
[14:29:12] <Dave_Stein> in actual IE8, it doesn't
[14:29:14] <y3di> can you give append an array of dom elements? the jquery page says so but when i try i get an error
[14:29:15] <Dave_Stein> $.map
[14:29:34] <NoiseEee> Dave_Stein: likely because "IE8 mode" doesn't quite do what you think it does
[14:30:26] <Dave_Stein> NoseEee: right, but shouldn't $.map give the same results no matter what? its diff depending on real IE8 vs IE8 mode
[14:30:30] <Dave_Stein> that's why i think it's a jq bug
[14:30:32] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ y3di
[14:30:32] <bot-t> y3di, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[14:31:53] <NoiseEee> Dave_Stein: no, because IE8 mode probably doesn't mean much in the 'real world'.... IE8 mode or not, it's still going to use the JS version in IE9
[14:32:11] <NoiseEee> Dave_Stein: it's not like "IE 8 mode" replaces the browser JS library with IE8's
[14:32:38] <jeffsmykil> are you sure?  I get IE 8 errors all the time in stuff I dont get in IE 9
[14:32:50] <Dave_Stein> right, but if IE8 mode works fine for $.map, and doesn't work with native JS, how can you say jquery didn't try to compensate for that bug?
[14:32:51] <jeffsmykil> for instance console.log working in IE9 but not IE 8
[14:33:08] <Dave_Stein> jeffsmykil: it would work if you had the developer tool open in IE8
[14:33:21] <jeffsmykil> ah
[14:33:31] <Dave_Stein> because i do agree the mode and the actual are diff engines
[14:33:46] <Dave_Stein> but if jquery didn't do anything it should still error in ie8 mode
[14:33:57] <Dave_Stein> unless map is not iterating using for in... i should check that possibly
[14:34:12] <Dave_Stein> but i'm not sure how else they'd loop... am i forgetting a way? :)
[14:35:37] <Dave_Stein> catch what i mean now? im not a good explainer

[14:44:06] <Guest8911> what's the relationship between that and jQuery(document).ready(function($) {....}
[14:44:09] <Guest8911> and
[14:44:18] <imsky> Guest8911: it's a shortcut for .ready
[14:44:48] <Guest8911> $(function() {
[14:45:04] <Guest8911> are all 3 equivalent?
[14:45:20] <Guest8911> i've just inherited some non-working code
[14:45:24] <coldhead> they are equivalent, Guest891, but you should use the full form $(document).ready()
[14:45:41] <Guest8911> the page has all 3 in it in 3 separate places
[14:45:45] <coldhead> because otherwise someone will be reading your code later and they will come to jQuery asking what it means
[14:45:53] <Guest8911> ;-)
[14:45:54] <coldhead> and i die inside a little more everytime that happens
[14:46:00] <coldhead> and imsky laughs
[14:46:04] <coldhead> he's such a trooper
[14:46:04] * imsky laughs
[14:46:06] <whoever> eddiemonge: ?? need somehelp on a callback, you around
[14:46:27] <imsky> i wonder if it's idiomatic to do $(document).on("ready"...
[14:46:28] <Guest8911> so they need to be combined into one $(document).ready
[14:46:57] <coldhead> that should work, Guest8911
[14:47:15] <whoever> i am tring this call back and the fadeout does finish but the alert does not happen $("#"+$(this).attr("id").fadeOut(1000), function(){alert("sometext");});
[14:47:19] <coldhead> imsky: when that becomes idiomatic i'm retiring
[14:47:28] <imsky> GET READY FOR FLORIDA BABY
[14:47:43] <Guest8911> what's the expected behavior when a page has 3 separate .ready fuctions?
[14:47:50] <Guest8911> so they all get fired?
[14:48:01] <Guest8911> or fubar?
[14:48:20] <imsky> coldhead: $(document).on("ready",function(){alert("\:D/"); });$(document).trigger("ready");
[14:48:21] <coldhead> they should all work, Guest8911
[14:48:39] <imsky> i guess you can combine the two statements
[14:48:50] <Guest8911> what if 2 are in <head> and one is in <body> ?
[14:48:53] <Guest8911> same same?
[14:49:04] <imsky> .ready handlers are queued up, Guest8911
[14:49:09] <Guest8911> ah
[14:49:09] <imsky> there can be only 1+
[14:49:28] <imsky> coldhead: that should be an interview question
[14:49:34] <Guest8911> so that's ugly, but probably not the source of the problem
[14:49:43] <imsky> what's wrong with this code: $(document).on("ready",function(){});
[14:50:02] <imsky> IT'S NOT A TRICK QUESTION
[14:50:09] <coldhead> the function doesn't do anything?
[14:50:14] <Guest8911> doesn't do anything?
[14:50:15] <eddiemonge> document doesnt have a ready state?
[14:50:27] <imsky> how is "not doing anything" wrong lol
[14:50:31] <Guest8911> good question
[14:50:31] <coldhead> phew, nice save eddiemonge
[14:50:39] <imsky> eddiemonge: wut
[14:50:57] <Guest8911> ready is just shorthand for another state
[14:51:00] <eddiemonge> whoever: can you rewrite that line?
[14:51:01] <Guest8911> cool question
[14:51:24] <Guest8911> hmmm
[14:51:30] <imsky> wait
[14:51:32] <Guest8911> dom is loaded, but not content
[14:51:32] <imsky> coldhead
[14:51:37] <imsky> it's right, it's idiomatic bro
[14:51:51] <imsky> http://jsfiddle.net/9wHcA/
[14:52:12] <coldhead> you cant make things idiomatic just by saying they're idiomatic, babe
[14:52:13] <imsky> time to retire for youse
[14:52:16] <coldhead> it's a cultural thing
[14:52:18] <jedimind> rofl imsky
[14:52:19] <coldhead> it has to emerge
[14:52:32] <coldhead> like a tender seedling
[14:52:39] <coldhead> that grows into a mighty cactus
[14:52:40] <imsky> are you trying to argue your way out of retirement
[14:52:43] <eddiemonge> imsky: i get two alerts
[14:52:45] <coldhead> yes
[14:52:46] <Guest8911> thanks for the help guys
[14:52:56] <imsky> jedimind: i thought it was wrong, but noap
[14:53:01] <imsky> GOOD TO GO JQUERY
[14:53:03] <coldhead> i can't retire now, i have too much to do
[14:53:32] <whoever> eddiemonge: you mean pastebin so that it is easier to read ? or just re-type it
[14:53:41] <imsky> apocalypse orchestra doesn't need jquery coldhead
[14:53:45] <eddiemonge> whichever, it looks like you have a typo
[14:54:00] <coldhead> I HAVEN'T EVEN REGISTERED THE DOMAIN NAME YET
[14:54:09] <imsky> eddiemonge: you shouldn't get 2 alerts, your browser's broken man
[14:54:24] <whoever> eddiemonge: $("#"+$(this).attr("id").fadeOut(1000), function(){alert("sometext");});
[14:54:46] <interopc1p> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/vbpDS/708/ I don't understand.  Help?
[14:54:51] <imsky> $("#"+$(this).attr("id")) is a cruel joke
[14:55:07] <interopc1p> I may not be using jsfiddle correctly
[14:55:16] <imsky> interopc1p: how did you know i'm a highcharts pro
[14:55:17] <imsky> did we work together
[14:55:42] <interopc1p> nah I couldn't remember the jsfiddle pg so I remembered that Highcharts uses it so I went there...
[14:55:52] <eddiemonge> imsky: i know its the definitive source, but i dont see ready here: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html
[14:55:59] <imsky> what don't you understand brother, interopc1p
[14:56:07] <imsky> eddiemonge: i hope you're not trolling me bud
[14:56:13] <eddiemonge> whoever: yeah that looks like its missing a closing paren. whats it supposed to do? jsfiddle it
[14:56:25] <interopc1p> imsky: I don't understand how to use .html() or .text()
[14:56:41] <eddiemonge> imsky: just saying, i dont see a "ready" event in native js
[14:56:46] <imsky> interopc1p: easy. .html() gets or sets html contents. .text() only gets the html stripped of any tags, just text
[14:56:57] <imsky> eddiemonge: there isn't one, we're in #jquery. you must have some browser craziness
[14:57:00] <interopc1p> is my code visible in thaqt jsfiddle?
[14:57:07] <imsky> yes
[14:57:26] <interopc1p> nah I hit refresh and I see Highcharts stuff again
[14:57:35] <imsky> coldhead: plz surrender your vim/emacs and your gun
[14:57:38] <interopc1p> I whacked all the highcharts stuff to put in my crappy code
[14:57:45] <imsky> interopc1p: did you hit save?
[14:57:59] <interopc1p> nah
[14:58:23] <imsky> something tells me that's important
[14:58:26] <coldhead> i'll turn them in at the end of the day, imsky
[14:58:33] <coldhead> gotta shoot some fools first
[14:58:39] <coldhead> SUCH AS YOURSELF
[14:58:43] <imsky> OH DAMN
[14:58:49] <imsky> \D:/
[14:59:29] <imsky> hope you don't elisp me to death
[15:00:03] <interopc1p> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/XbvFq/ I don't understand why this doesn't work.
[15:00:13] <interopc1p> probabl something stoopid
[15:00:46] <imsky> you can't use .text() to set anything
[15:00:49] <imsky> especially an input
[15:00:53] <imsky> for inputs, use .val()
[15:02:03] <imsky> also you're not using jquery
[15:02:10] <imsky> so you're not even seeing it being broken
[15:02:47] <interopc1p> zoom all that just went way over my head

[15:06:04] <sean`> interopc1p, go!
[15:06:14] <sphinxxx> fatninja, that is the shortcut
[15:06:19] <sean`> use that brain of yours
[15:06:24] <fatninja> :)) ok ok
[15:06:36] <coldhead> use the power of mental thought, make it dynamic

[15:06:45] <sean`> fatninja, don't give us fake shit plz
[15:07:07] <supsup> fatninja u can make a jquery var and use .attr on it to make it shorter ~~
[15:07:45] <fatninja> sean`: excuse me ?
[15:07:59] <sean`> why are there two ppl starting with 'fat'
[15:08:03] <fatninja> supsup: yes I know, but since 'value' is a very used attribute I thought it would have a shortcut
[15:08:06] <AfroTurf> $("table tr:not(:eq(0)) td").not(":eq(5)") only works on the first row of the table.. how do i make it work on all rows
[15:08:13] <sean`> fatninja, .val() is the shortcut
[15:08:40] <fatninja> sean` : it is not
[15:08:44] <sean`> fatninja, it is
[15:08:45] <imsky> lol
[15:09:04] <supsup> fatninaja u could make a var  v = 'value' and then make attr(v)!

[15:10:11] <sean`> hi coldhead
[15:10:23] <fatninja> I know I tried .val() once and didn't work as I expected
[15:10:40] <sean`> fatninja, 'bla bla' is not your _real_ selector I assume
[15:11:08] <fatninja> are you a black magician ?
[15:11:11] <sean`> AfroTurf, that selector should _not_ work on the first row

[15:11:57] <sean`> AfroTurf, yes
[15:12:00] <AfroTurf> sean` it should work on the rest of the rows though correct?
[15:12:07] <sean`> yes
[15:12:25] <sean`> tr:gt(0) td:not(eq(5))
[15:12:32] <sean`> will work on all except the 1st row
[15:12:43] <AfroTurf> k let me try that

[15:14:46] <AfroTurf> sean` 3rd and 4th rows i meant

[15:42:53] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query and wonder how i could solve this: i have a div which id like to hide when clicking on the body but not on itself. someone a hint for me? or isn't this possible because its the body?
[15:44:17] <nicholasschulz> $('#body').click ( function () {    $(#div).hide();  });
[15:44:46] <nicholasschulz> sorry, should be $('body').click

[15:47:51] <imsky> no problem mightym
[15:48:26] <mightym> nicholasschulz: sry, but thats not working cause clicking on the div is also a click on the body

[16:00:24] <ibodi> why html5 has tag such as header ? is it useful? why not just use <div id='header'>  instead
[16:00:37] <ibodi> sorry off topic, but #html can not chat
[16:01:41] <lc2> ibodi: because id='header' could as well be id='dongs' or id='footer' used as a header
[16:02:05] <lc2> the idea behind it is because it's structural markup
[16:02:22] <imsky> ?g html5 header tag why
[16:02:22] <bot-t> imsky, HTML5 header Tag - http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_header.asp
[16:02:29] <imsky> bot-t you bastard
[16:04:26] <ibodi> imsky: i have use <div id='footer'> for many years. i can not see why there is a tech reason to have <footer>. it is exactly same as <div> result
[16:04:58] <imsky> ibodi: yeah i see where you're coming from, but let's say you wanted to create a content-heavy site with lots of blog posts
[16:05:08] <imsky> and let's say later on someone wanted to parse your source code
[16:05:10] <ibodi> unless it is used by search engine to ignore
[16:05:22] <imsky> if you have a footer tag and a header tag, you just made that person's job easier
[16:05:28] <imsky> they just search for <article> tags and extract them
[16:06:19] <imsky> or they strip header and footer, etc
[16:06:31] <imsky> where as with divs, you just have undifferentiated div tags everywhere
[16:06:35] <shadykhan> what do you guys think is a reasonable starting salary for an entry level front end developer?
[16:06:44] <xrated> I come in here adn the first thing I read is strip
[16:08:27] <ibodi> imsky: ok thanks i value guys' work, however we can use it when our sites need them.
[16:08:53] <imsky> ibodi: really though, if you're thinking about html5, then you should use these tags. otherwise, stick to html4/xhtml
[16:10:16] <ibodi> imsky: it is still html5 code without <header> do you agree ? we do not have to use it , am i correct ?
[16:11:01] <imsky> yeah sure, but then that's like buying a ferrari and going 30 miles per hour all the time
[16:11:13] <imsky> you're coding like it's 2003, essentially
[16:13:11] <ibodi> imsky: sorry, lost meaning of your joke :D i m coding html5 page, which does not have tag <header> because i do not have special contents treated as a <header> yet :)
[16:13:39] <imsky> ok so don't put it in yet
[16:13:43] <imsky> it's not a _requirement_
[16:13:46] <imsky> but it's a good practice
[16:13:54] <ibodi> imsky: ok
[16:15:42] <ibodi> imsky: <b><u> are good tags as they produces special output. <header> will be good tag when it is handy for many reasons.
[16:15:57] <imsky> hmm
[16:16:02] <imsky> we don't really use <b> or <u> anymore
[16:16:42] <badbandit> hello
[16:17:07] <badbandit> Im having an issue where webkit browsers are not calculating the width of list items the same as FF
[16:17:17] <ibodi> imsky: <b><u><i><a><s> are really useful tags. sadly some of them have to exit
[16:17:29] <badbandit> anyone have knowledge of this?
[16:17:55] <ibodi> imsky: i love one-char tags which produce different results :)
[16:18:02] <imsky> lol
[16:18:18] <mightym> imsky: in your solution if(e.target.id!="wafflefries"){ … is it possible to combine several id? like i have x elements i don't want to be clickable?
[16:18:35] <imsky> yep absolutely
[16:19:21] <imsky> probably give them a class though ;)
[16:22:06] <ibodi> imsky: let's bet in 5 years, html5 has <b><u>,or not :)
[16:22:18] <imsky> ok, i bet not
[16:22:23] <mightym> imsky: the elements are all in #wafflefries , maybe i can use something like " select childs" ?
[16:22:25] <ibodi> i bet yes.
[16:22:52] <imsky> mightym: ok, then it's easy: $(this).parents("#wafflefries").length>0
[16:22:59] <imsky> err
[16:23:05] <imsky> $(e.target) instead of $(this)
[16:23:26] <ibodi> imsky: whoever lost, donate $50 to your local charity :)
[16:23:32] <imsky> will do buddy
[16:23:37] <ibodi> LOL
[16:24:05] <ibodi> imsky: that's a lucky reason we will survive 2012

[16:28:48] <Eviltwin> And those first two mean different things
[16:28:58] <Eviltwin> But I think you can figure that out
[16:29:16] <Eviltwin> Also "a error" is not terribly helpful
[16:33:33] <mightym> imsky: hmm (this).parents("#wafflefries").length>0 seems not to work … what i like to have is if(e.target.id!="the-settings"){ but also for every child element of #wafflefries

[16:38:42] <mightym> imsky: sry i don't get it :( if have this http://pastie.org/3157517 but it returns me TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '(e.target).parents("#the-settings")')
[16:39:01] <imsky> not (e.target), $(e.target)
[16:40:50] <mightym> imsky: ah :) but this is exactly the opposite what i want, it removes #the-seetings on click on its child elements but not on click on the body f.e
[16:41:26] <jedimind> seetings eh
[16:41:27] <bot-t> (25 mins 40 secs ago) <gf3> tell jedimind Yo!
[16:41:33] <jedimind> what? i didnt do it!

[16:50:56] <solidus-river> is there a way to have a div centered and stuck to the bottom of a page and still count towards the pages width / height as far as scrolling is concerned?
[16:51:25] <ari5av> is there a jquery function to get the number of elements returned?  like $('#mydiv').children().count() or something?
[16:51:25] <solidus-river> i know i can use position: fixed and stick it to the bottom, but that makes the actually width / height of the page non responsive to its height

[16:53:01] <muzone> At my dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FEstp/ - I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone by moving the clicked link from the dropdown into the main menu to act as a temporary h1. But where do I start?
[16:53:04] <muzone> I'll gladly let you borrow my beach hut in French Polynesia for about a month or two if you help me out: http://imagecache6.allposters.com/LRG/36/3628/JNXEF00Z.jpg - thanks in advance!

[16:55:14] <texinwien> ari5av: np
[16:56:20] <pimperle> hi
[16:56:33] <ari5av> what I'm doing is dynamically adding radio buttons.  the first one has value="0", and the next one which is added by cloning the first one should get value="1", then the next value="2", and so on
[16:56:46] <pimperle> somehow my keydown events handled by jquery end up with metaKey set to true, when only the ctrl-key is pressen
[16:56:49] <pimperle> -n+d
[16:57:14] <pimperle> i noticed, that this does not happen on the example on api.jquery.com
[16:57:52] <pimperle> i immediately log the event with console.log(event) in the event handler
[16:58:03] <pimperle> how can i debug where those meta keys come from?
[17:01:27] <mightym> hmmm or maybe someone else can tell me how i can catch all child elements plus the origin element like this: if(e.target.id!="the-settings") … i need to say "if everything except the id and its children"
[17:01:38] <pimperle> i'm using jquery 1.6.2. Can i somehow print the version jquery.com is using?
[17:01:46] <pimperle> $.version would be nice but doesn't work
[17:03:30] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/mrdwW/ - how do I move a link from the dropdown into the main menu when clicked?
[17:03:43] <pimperle> $().jquery prints the version
[17:03:51] <pimperle> and indeed it seems to be a bug in 1.6.2
[17:05:06] <pimperle> is 1.6.2 still active and should i report that bug?
[17:05:10] <pimperle> or is it outdated anyways?
[17:06:46] <imsky> lol

[17:42:18] <pringlescan> Hey all, I need some help with namespaces. I'm trying to include my debug code using getScript, however, when I do so, it can't call any of the functions in my application. I'm not sure how to fix the problem. Calling using the full name, window or is incorrect in this context.
[17:43:35] <mattp_> is anyone familiar with pjax?
[17:44:20] <pringlescan> mattp, phlapjax is my favorite thing eat for breakfast. the two might be related.
[17:56:01] <pringlescan> How can I include an external file into the current namespace/scope?
[17:57:33] <texinwien> pringlescan: more info please.
[17:57:45] <texinwien> pringlescan: sample code?
[18:00:22] <pringlescan> texinwien: http://pastebin.com/DjKSxxWQ
[18:07:13] <texinwien> pringlescan: one thought - getScript is just a shorthand for $.ajax()
[18:07:39] <pringlescan> would appending a <script> to the head at runtime accomplish this?
[18:08:30] <texinwien> you may be able to do this if you pull in debug.js as JSONP
[18:09:32] <texinwien> which would be basically the same thing as appending a <script> to the head at runtime.
[18:09:44] <DofLeFou> I m doing an AJAX POST … in my data my trying to pass in some javascript content
[18:09:52] <texinwien> except that you'd wrap the debug code in a function
[18:09:56] <DofLeFou> and shit is not working
[18:10:51] <DofLeFou> how do you pass in a JS content in your DATA
[18:11:14] <pringlescan> texinwien, javascript and jquery is very fun and easy to pick up, but finding the proper way to create manageable code seems to be up for debate
[18:17:33] <texinwien> you want to ask for it as JSON - it'll be returned as an object, which you can then assign to something in your namespace
[18:18:03] <texinwien> getScript() won't do the trick - the docs state specifically that scripts returned that way are executed in the global context.
[18:18:18] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: You around?
[18:19:34] <texinwien> no I'm sorry, that also won't work for more complex code.
[18:22:02] <pringlescan> texinwien, also, why can't I call the code in my namespace from the global context of getscript when I explicitly use the full name (ns.function)
[18:22:15] <pringlescan> I tried window.ns.function this.ns.function and none of them resolve properly...
[18:23:07] <texinwien> pringlescan: I believe you want to wrap your debug code in a named function that returns everything in a way that you can append it to an object in your namespace
[18:23:44] <texinwien> pringlescan: Not sure how you're setting up the namespace, but I haven't had a problem with calling namespaced code from the global context
[18:24:46] <texinwien> then, at getScript.success(), set this.debugger = named_function();
[18:25:02] <texinwien> make sense? named_function() just returns all of your debug code. Now it should be in your namespace.
[18:26:22] <pringlescan> the fact that it doesn't is a testimate to what two days of 17 hour coding binges does to your mind
[18:26:35] <pringlescan> it's very close to making sense
[18:27:58] <pringlescan> I don't see how putting all of my debug.js in a function and then calling it will introduce it to the right scope… because if I put it inside a name function isn't that executing in the scope of that funciton
[18:29:06] <DofLeFou> hey what am i doing wrong here https://gist.github.com/1586474
[18:29:14] <texinwien> I don't know what your debug code looks like, but if it's contained in an object, you can simply write a function that returns that object, then call it on success
[18:29:30] <DofLeFou> content .. alway come back null
[18:30:20] <DofLeFou> if i console.log of it i get the correct
[18:30:22] <pringlescan> I define functions in my debug code though so unless I prototype them in my main code and then assign them as variables in my debug code I'm not sure how that works
[18:30:39] <Eviltwin> DofLeFou: For one thing, I would look at JSON.stringify
[18:30:48] <texinwien> In your debug.js: function return_debugger() {return {//this is the object that holds your debug code}}
[18:31:48] <DofLeFou> Eviltwin .. thanks for the pointer  .. more food
[18:31:53] <texinwien> Now at getscript.success you say hf.debugger = return_debugger()
[18:32:28] <pringlescan> why would it be hf.debugger?
[18:32:32] <texinwien> then you should have an object called 'debugger' in your 'hf' namespace containing the debug object defined in the external script.
[18:33:00] <pringlescan> inside my namespace I get to call things locally
[18:33:10] <pringlescan> i'm just confused as all hell why when I try to call things from hf. from global it doesn't work
[18:33:24] <pringlescan> this shouldn't even be an issue other than my debug code poisoning the gloabl scope
[18:33:29] <texinwien> I'm saying you organize your debug code into an object
[18:33:53] <texinwien> then you write a function that returns that object
[18:34:06] <texinwien> you add a stub function called 'debugger' to hf
[18:34:23] <texinwien> and set that hf.debugger = the function that returns the object
[18:34:50] <pringlescan> i guess i just don't understand how to object is going to call things in hf
[18:34:58] <texinwien> then you have all of your debug object in hf.debugger, executing in the hf. namespace.
[18:35:29] <texinwien> pringlescan: Sorry, it's a bit theoretical without knowing what's in your debug.js
[18:35:31] <pringlescan> ok, so i'll try to figure that out, but, the question i have is why can't I call things in the hf. space from global anyway?
[18:36:16] <texinwien> pringescan: just from the script you pull in via getScript, or you can't call hf.code from the global scope, in general?
[18:37:15] <pringlescan> yes
[18:37:37] <pringlescan> if I could do that, which is how I thought it'd work, i wouldn't be trying to inject my code into the current scope
[18:38:08] <pringlescan> that was my initial question, but since it was too complicated, i decided to dumb it down, in which case I completely misdescribed the problem I was even having, which is my fault
[18:38:15] <texinwien> so you are unable to call hf.code from the global scope, in general?
[18:38:19] <pringlescan> yes
[18:38:48] <pringlescan> BUT the code that calls debug.js code and has the error is in the hf.code… so that means the hf object should exist in javascript...
[18:38:59] <pringlescan> OR does the hf object not exist until it's contents are executed?
[18:39:21] <texinwien> that shouldn't be the case. Try a simple jsfiddle?
[18:41:33] <pringlescan> i mean i have a debugger running in chrome and firebug, the functions don't resolve
[18:41:52] <pringlescan> oh you mean try what i'm doing in js fiddle and see if it works
[18:41:53] <pringlescan> … duh
[18:42:05] <texinwien> http://jsfiddle.net/YgESv/
[18:42:29] <texinwien> pringlescan: make sure your console is open when you run that.
[18:45:32] <pringlescan> texinwien, that works thanks, i have a migraine, i'm going to re-read some stuff on scope and if i still have questions, i'll come back, i must be doing something seriously wrong.
[18:45:49] <pringlescan> did you see my pastebin? that was an okay way of defining my hf. namespace, correct?
[18:45:49] <aitiba> hi
[18:46:23] <aitiba> how can I do the efect when the scrolls down please? http://lamoulade.com/

[18:47:50] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/ - I have some main menu links (#main-menu li a's) containing some dropdown links (#main-menu li li a's). How do I make it so that when a user clicks on the dropdown links, they temporarily replace their parent main menu link (to sorta act like a breadcrumb)?

[18:52:47] <jon30> hi. when i scroll my mouse over certain div, i'd like a little box to popup with information and possibly follow the mouse. how can i achive this?
[18:55:26] <texinwien> pringlescan: not if you expect to be able to call hf.initialize_debug_mode()
[18:56:31] <Patabugen> jon30: it sounds like you want a tooltip plugin, there's several. Stick "jquery tooltip" into your favourite search engine
[18:59:54] <shintaku> are there advantages / disadvantages to these:  $("#foo .bar") and $(".bar", "#foo")
[19:01:58] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:02:44] <shintaku> what are they?
[19:02:57] <shintaku> i've always assumed they were equivalent, but see the latter more often
[19:02:59] <shintaku> is it faster
[19:03:11] <shintaku> or are they not equivalent in what they do
[19:03:56] <Eviltwin> They produce the same result but get there slightly different ways
[19:04:07] <Eviltwin> The second is marginally faster
[19:04:29] <shintaku> interesting
[19:04:32] <shintaku> i'll need to look up why
[19:07:29] <Eviltwin> Well, huh
[19:07:32] <Eviltwin> It's more than marginally slower here: http://jsperf.com/selector-vs-context-vs-find
[19:10:19] <Eviltwin> And it's the opposite in Opera
[19:11:21] <donCams> is there  a jquery plugin that does something similar to this http://doodletops.tumblr.com/
[19:12:37] <Eviltwin> Wouldn't be hard to make assuming you had access to CSS3 animations or at least transformations
[19:13:49] <Eviltwin> This is done using entirely CSS
[19:14:16] <Eviltwin> (CSS3)
[19:43:12] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm trying to apply some kind of fade in when I use a .load() function … it's not working though… any ideas ? https://gist.github.com/11d2568a078fd5f26821
[19:47:46] <Eviltwin> MrGando: Looks like it should work to me
[19:47:52] <Eviltwin> What's happening?
[19:48:02] <MrGando> Eviltwin: I just don't see the fadeIn happening
[19:48:41] <MrGando> Eviltwin: The page is loaded correctly into my div … but the fadeIn is not happening
[19:48:41] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/ - I have some main menu links (#main-menu li a's) containing some dropdown links (#main-menu li li a's). How do I make it so that when a user clicks on the dropdown links, they temporarily replace their parent main menu link (to sorta act like a breadcrumb)?
[19:50:20] <MrGando> :(
[19:52:33] <Eviltwin> MrGando: I think you need to do .hide().fadeIn(...)
[19:52:44] <MrGando> Eviltwin: let me try :)
[19:53:42] <MrGando> Eviltwin: Great :)
[19:53:43] <Eviltwin> You could also do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QeGNc/
[19:56:45] <muzone> Eviltwin: you got any word of advice on how to achieve this type of nav menu?
[19:59:42] <muzone> Eviltwin: hello?
[20:00:08] <Eviltwin> muzone: Which?
[20:00:25] <troubleman> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/1/
[20:00:52] <troubleman> muzone: i tried but im not really sure what to do, sorry
[20:01:04] <muzone> Eviltwin: yeah http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/1/
[20:01:08] <muzone> troubleman: its cool thanks for trying though
[20:01:53] <tga> hello
[20:02:00] <Eviltwin> So they need to click Category A then click Test 1?
[20:02:08] <Eviltwin> Not mouseover and click Test 1?
[20:02:45] <muzone> Eviltwin: sorry yeah mouseover and click Test 1
[20:03:56] <shadykhan> eviltwin ur always on irc lol
[20:04:21] <troubleman> shadykhan: or always working because he's got his eyes on the good life
[20:05:00] <saliak> How would i serialize the values of a given form by it's #id?
[20:05:01] <troubleman> shadykhan: wealth, fame and peace of mind doesn't come easy - but irc is the best medium for harvesting business intelligence
[20:05:15] <GranMal> Quick question: Is it considered a best practice to use $.isPlainObject ? Or is this not necessary, if anyone has a good article on it, I would love to be able to read more about it if it is considered a best practice
[20:05:45] <tga> what's the proper way to change an <a> element's behaviour while keeping its original src?
[20:05:51] <tga> this is what I'm trying http://jsfiddle.net/g8aUh/2/
[20:07:07] <GranMal> tga: are you trying to prevent the default behavior?
[20:07:10] * tga wants to keep srcs normal but to redirect to a wrapper page on click
[20:07:10] <tga> yes
[20:07:22] <tga> I tried e.preventDefault() but it didn't help
[20:07:43] <GranMal> use this.preventDefault();
[20:07:43] <tga> I mean keep hrefs normal
[20:07:49] <GranMal> hmm
[20:08:12] <tga> doesn't work
[20:09:10] <saliak> ok, nevemind, my multiselect array was screwing serialize up. geez.
[20:09:42] <tga> GranMal, it doesn't work, right?
[20:10:12] <muzone> Eviltwin: so what you reckon, how should one go about this?
[20:10:17] <GranMal> Are you trying to load to a div, or a frame?
[20:10:47] <GranMal> That question was for you tga
[20:11:42] <tga> GranMal, I have regular links that I'm trying to send through a wrapper page
[20:11:42] <Eviltwin> muzone: Working on it. Give me time.
[20:12:00] <tga> GranMal, so I'm changing window.location, no div or frame
[20:12:07] <GranMal> tga: What exactly do you mean by wrapper page
[20:12:12] <GranMal> That's my question
[20:12:24] <tga> basically I want to change the url of the link
[20:12:27] <tga> append something to it
[20:12:39] <muzone> Eviltwin: sweet, awesome man..
[20:12:46] <GranMal> tga: onClick?
[20:12:49] <tga> but without changing the href
[20:12:50] <muzone> matter of fact lemme call my maid and have her prepare your beach hut right away :-)
[20:12:53] <GranMal> ok
[20:12:54] <tga> GranMal, yes
[20:12:55] <GranMal> 1 sec
[20:13:39] <tga> GranMal, so if I have <a href="google.com">, on click I want to redirect to http://me.com/a=google.com
[20:13:40] <muzone> aint nothing sitting with ones macbook, a bottle of whiskey and staring out over the pacific ocean
[20:13:43] <tga> GranMal, something like that
[20:14:26] <SeanJM> I have an event like this $(".click tr").click(function() { }); and I need to check if something inside .click tr was clicked, only because of $(".click tr").click(function() { }); -- I can't get a click event for that element
[20:16:03] <SeanJM> tga: you want to convert all a href="google.com" links to open that other page?
[20:17:38] <Eviltwin> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/4/
[20:18:06] <tga> yeah
[20:18:16] <tga> GranMal, SeanJM  thanks, I got it
[20:18:24] <tga> the script was running before the page was ready or something
[20:18:29] <tga> it works now
[20:18:49] <SeanJM> tga: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript <--- basically $("a").click(function() { if $(this).attr("href") == some address) { window.location.href = http://me.com/a=google.com"; });
[20:18:57] <SeanJM> tga: k, well, there it is pasted anyways
[20:19:02] <Eviltwin> muzone: Was that what you were looking for?
[20:19:02] <SeanJM> tga: :-)
[20:19:28] <muzone> Eviltwin: damn.. for real man..
[20:19:32] <muzone> that is some real shit
[20:19:37] <muzone> yes exactly like that!
[20:19:46] <tga> SeanJM, thanks, I might actually use that actually
[20:20:38] <muzone> Eviltwin: any chance it could switch (and hide the dropdown) immediately after clicking the link?
[20:20:42] <SeanJM> tga: sounds good, glad it ended up being useful
[20:21:18] <muzone> Eviltwin: and also change colors?
[20:21:32] <Eviltwin> muzone: All in the bottom block there
[20:24:10] <muzone> Eviltwin: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/5/
[20:24:15] <muzone> i mean obvious not but..
[20:25:12] <Eviltwin> Do you want to temporarily change the color or "permanently"
[20:25:43] <Eviltwin> Not sure why you thought this would work
[20:27:19] <muzone> Eviltwin: permanently, but only for the TEST N when they appear in CATEGORY X's place
[20:27:23] <muzone> if that makes sense
[20:27:44] <muzone> sorta to like distinguish them from the rest
[20:31:43] <SeanJM> http://jsfiddle.net/jrB64/13/ <--- this sums up my problem pretty simply
[20:39:51] <Eviltwin> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/7/
[20:40:20] <Eviltwin> And as always, I'm accepting donations at http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[20:41:18] <Eviltwin> It should be pretty easy to tweak from here
[20:43:36] <muzone> Eviltwin: goodness gracious :-)
[20:44:25] <muzone> Eviltwin: thanks a LOT
[20:44:37] <muzone> ill make a small donation when i get my paycheck later this week
[20:44:46] <Eviltwin> Thanks :D
[20:45:13] <Eviltwin> Also, I'd suggest switching these from setting the background and color properties to adding and removing CSS classes
[20:45:19] <GranMal> Anyone know of a good (and currently operating) jquery challenge site? I want to learn more, and books only get me so far ... Want to hone my skills.
[20:45:41] <tga> http://jsfiddle.net/g8aUh/16/
[20:45:46] <Eviltwin> GranMal: Solve muzone's problem again
[20:45:52] <tga> what's the correct way of getting an element's data inside its click() function?
[20:45:55] <muzone> hehehe
[20:45:58] <muzone> Eviltwin: yeah thats a great idea
[20:46:02] <tga> http://jsfiddle.net/g8aUh/16/
[20:46:19] <muzone> Eviltwin: what does elem mean?
[20:46:19] <tga> this is what I'm trying
[20:46:28] <muzone> Eviltwin: ah element
[20:46:28] <Eviltwin> tga: This is covered on http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[20:46:44] <GranMal> Eviltwin ... Do you have the original link handy?
[20:46:44] <Eviltwin> muzone: I broke them out so they can be manually triggered
[20:47:00] <tga> $(this), bingo
[20:47:20] <Eviltwin> GranMal: http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/
[20:47:25] <tga> thanks Eviltwin
[20:47:27] <GranMal> Thank you sir
[20:51:11] <muzone> Eviltwin: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/8/
[20:51:54] <Eviltwin> muzone: Dude, you need to learn JavaScript
[20:52:15] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ muzone
[20:52:15] <bot-t> muzone, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:53:18] <muzone> hehe yeah.. i sure do
[20:53:29] <coldhead> i quibble with that factoid
[20:53:39] <Eviltwin> Why?
[20:53:56] <coldhead> because you can do nice stuff with only shreds of javascript expertise
[20:54:12] <coldhead> jquery is a good crutch to lean on while you learn JS
[20:54:55] <coldhead> but different strokes, right? my aim in #jQuery is usually to send people on their way, Eviltwin prefers to make them better people :D
[20:55:23] <Eviltwin> I'd say that at least 70% of errors I see in here are either pure JavaScript errors or would have been trivial to diagnose if they knew advanced JavaScript
[20:55:36] <Eviltwin> i.e. what's possible and what's not
[20:55:50] <coldhead> yeah, i'm with you there
[20:56:00] <coldhead> i just feel like you can do js + jq together
[20:56:15] <coldhead> rather than sequentially
[20:56:20] <Eviltwin> The problem is that jQuery takes advantage of advanced JavaScript right off the bat
[20:56:37] <coldhead> good jquery does that
[20:56:38] <Eviltwin> At least intermediate from the first line
[20:56:40] <Eviltwin> With chaining
[20:56:46] <coldhead> right
[20:56:50] <coldhead> and anonymous functions
[20:57:03] <TofuTurkey> sorry how do I trap the cancel action without an init function, as in something like : $("#newFolder").submit(function(event) { for for cancel action ?
[20:57:10] <coldhead> well i defer to your superior wisdom, Eviltwin
[20:57:18] <coldhead> i'm glad we had this talk
[20:57:31] <versatiletech> TofuTurkey: event.preventDefault()?
[20:57:40] <wookiehangover> TofuTurkey: or `return false;`
[20:57:44] <TofuTurkey> not that but the actual cancel
[20:58:05] <versatiletech> huh?
[20:58:12] <TofuTurkey> hmm
[20:58:31] <TofuTurkey> how can I know via jquery when the cancel button is pressed
[20:58:42] <versatiletech> oh
[20:58:48] <TofuTurkey> something like $("#newFolder").submit(function(event) {  but for cancel
[20:58:48] <versatiletech> that depends on a variety of things
[20:59:30] <TofuTurkey> hard to google it sends me to the prevent default as well
[20:59:42] <Eviltwin> TofuTurkey: Don't believe there's a cancel event
[21:00:11] <versatiletech> yeah, just add a click handler for the cancel button then do event.preventDefault()
[21:00:16] <TofuTurkey> ok how do I know which button is used to submit the form then ?
[21:00:25] <TofuTurkey> i dont want to init nothing
[21:00:38] <TofuTurkey>  versatiletech: as in ?
[21:00:44] <Eviltwin> TofuTurkey: submit and cancel are different things
[21:01:12] <TofuTurkey> Eviltwin: correct I want jquery to do something when the cancel is pressed
[21:01:17] <versatiletech> $('.myCancelButtonSelector').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault() } );
[21:01:34] <Eviltwin> TofuTurkey: $("#myform input[type=cancel]").click(function(event) { ... })
[21:01:44] <TofuTurkey> amazing , thanks guys
[21:02:24] <TofuTurkey> versatiletech: thank you
[21:02:32] <versatiletech> if you look at the HTML it'll probably say something like <input type="reset" value="Cancel" />
[21:02:33] <TofuTurkey> Eviltwin: thank you
[21:02:51] <Eviltwin> Sorry, then [type=reset] instead
[21:02:52] <versatiletech> I'm just assuming since I have no idea what you're HTML looks like
[21:03:03] <versatiletech> np
[21:03:13] <TofuTurkey> I can write any html for it, is not typed in
[21:03:41] <TofuTurkey> infact can be xname button that is trapped
[21:03:45] <TofuTurkey> thanks again will get right on it
[21:06:04] <muzone> Eviltwin: any chance you can help me seal off http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/11/

[21:06:24] <muzone> also we need to talk about how to get you to french polynesia

[21:10:23] <muzone> Eviltwin: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/12/ - also the last offHover has onHover's colors, I was a bit confused by that. also any idea what to do with point 2. in the HTML (regarding NEW) - and also any chance you can help me write those comments for your fly ass blocks so that i can get a better understanding of what's going on?
[21:10:58] <Eviltwin> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/13/

[21:12:21] <muzone> right on brother..
[21:12:28] <muzone> yeah im definitely buying that book
[21:13:12] <coldhead> which book?
[21:13:19] <muzone> how'd you comment those various blocks? in ways kids would understand
[21:13:39] <Eviltwin> How'd I comment them?
[21:14:06] <muzone> coldhead: any book will do
[21:14:06] <Eviltwin> I used //
[21:14:07] <Eviltwin> :P
[21:14:22] <muzone> Eviltwin: i mean like
[21:14:32] <muzone> i always like to comment "my" code in non-technical terms
[21:14:45] <coldhead> this is nice, muzone http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[21:15:19] <muzone> cheers coldhead !
[21:17:09] <kelly1212> can someone please help me understand why this code is not working?
[21:17:10] <kelly1212> https://gist.github.com/1587144
[21:18:31] <Eviltwin> kelly1212: You can't have more than one element with the same ID
[21:19:41] <GranMal> Eviltwin: wow ... you're a busy man
[21:20:22] <kelly1212> :( i changed from id to class and still no cigar
[21:20:45] <Patabugen> kelly1212 you'll need to specify which ul you want to be opening
[21:20:59] <Patabugen> perhaps using .siblings()
[21:21:28] <kelly1212> $('drop', this) ===== would that work?
[21:21:33] <Patabugen> (You might also want to give the parent's a class, since you'll probably want to give the appearing items anchors too)
[21:21:53] <Patabugen> With a . before 'drop'
[21:22:01] <muzone> Eviltwin: any thoughts on the comments, and if possible point #1? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/14/
[21:22:04] <Patabugen> $('.drop')
[21:22:43] <muzone> amazing code though
[21:22:48] <muzone> eloquent like obama, damn !!
[21:26:54] <garbas> hey guys, how can i get document/window out of selected element? is there even a way to do this?
[21:27:48] <Patabugen> garbas How do you mean?
[21:29:20] <garbas> Patabugen: lets say code is located in iframe and is doing something with top frame
[21:29:43] <garbas> Patabugen: or consider more iframes
[21:30:12] <Patabugen> Ah, you want to get the parent window from inside an iframe? Or the contents of an iframe from the parent?
[21:30:24] <garbas> Patabugen: none of this :)
[21:30:33] <garbas> Patabugen: i need to get document out of elemnt
[21:30:40] <Cork> garbas: as far as i know, a jquery selection can't have elements from different documents
[21:30:48] <garbas> $('.some-el').getDocument()
[21:31:25] <garbas> something like above … if exists
[21:31:28] <Patabugen> Ah I see
[21:31:44] <Patabugen> perhaps .closest(document) is possible?
[21:32:25] <garbas> Patabugen: doesn't work
[21:32:36] <Patabugen> I'm all out then I'm afraid
[21:32:55] <garbas> Patabugen: tnx … was nice try, didn't thought of that
[21:33:34] <garbas> Cork: $('.some-elem', document) and $('.some-elem', window.parent.document) works
[21:34:15] <Cork> ya, but that will be separat selectors
[21:34:24] <Cork> though i've never tried merging them
[21:34:47] <garbas> Cork: i don't need that feature .. just document from selected element
[21:35:23] <Cork> garbas: in what way do you need it?
[21:35:26] <garbas> Cork: i believe it must me avaliable somewhere … at least for inner things
[21:35:35] <Cork> that is, do you need to filter on it, or use it or what?
[21:35:37] <Patabugen> garbas: Try console.log-ing the element and browsing through the firebug tabs
[21:36:47] <garbas> Patabugen: did that the last hour :) … i said maybe somebody knows
[21:36:55] <coldhead> ?mdc ownerdocument
[21:36:59] <bot-t1> coldhead, Node.ownerDocument - MDN - The ownerDocument property returns the top-level document object for this node. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node.ownerDocument
[21:37:07] <coldhead> garbas: ^^
[21:37:17] <Cork> coldhead: cheater ;P
[21:37:24] <garbas> Cork: i need to access document and only elem is passed
[21:37:31] <Cork> so $(selector).each(function() { this.ownerDocument });
[21:37:37] <garbas> coldhead: let me give it a try ...
[21:38:03] <coldhead> var doc = $('.someselector')[0].ownerDocument;
[21:38:09] <coldhead> or $(el)
[21:38:12] <garbas> coldhead: worked .. tnx
[21:38:16] <coldhead> hooray!!
[21:38:29] <coldhead> not sure how that goes across browsers though, have fun testing :D

[21:45:22] <coldhead> ah
[21:46:32] <abjorn> I suppose it makes sense
[21:46:50] <abjorn> it's better than what some sysadmins do ._.

[21:49:51] <Beginner> Anyone know of any great books for jQuery available from places like Barnes?
[21:50:45] <abjorn> idk find some O'Reilly book
[21:50:48] <abjorn> those are usually good
[21:50:58] <abjorn> there's at least 30248572309485 O'Reilly books on jQuery
[21:51:02] <Beginner> I've checked out a few of those.
[21:51:07] <coldhead> i'm not sure there are any print books on jQuery > 1.4
[21:51:12] <Beginner> I'll have to look into those books more for more web development.
[21:51:18] <abjorn> there isn't
[21:51:35] <abjorn> hasn't been a jQuery book published in awhile, most of the books coming out these days are more general javascript
[21:51:35] <coldhead> and resig's secrets of the JS ninja seems to be staying secret
[21:51:42] <abjorn> very seekrit
[21:51:49] <abjorn> plus that's another general js book i believe
[21:51:58] <Beginner> What's that?
[21:52:14] <coldhead> eloquent javascript is good
[21:52:18] <coldhead> ?g eloquent javascript
[21:52:19] <bot-t1> coldhead, Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming - http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[21:52:48] <coldhead> i guess the thing to do is get jQuery in Action or somesuch and then hunker down with the changelogs to see what's new since 1.4
[21:53:11] <coldhead> would be nice if someone did a book with deferred()s
[21:53:13] <Beginner> Sounds like a plan.
[21:53:26] <coldhead> jQ in Action is pretty good, Beginner
[21:53:28] <Beginner> So why don't you go for it?
[21:53:34] <coldhead> i make my minions read it
[21:53:45] <coldhead> i'm too old to write a book
[21:53:46] <Beginner> LOL
[21:53:53] <rfw> hi there, just a question about jquery.Deferred --- i'm piping stuff through it but the doneFilter may throw an exception
[21:54:19] <rfw> and so i can't catch it and it doesn't get passed out as a deferred.reject
[21:54:22] <Beginner> How old is too old?
[21:54:26] <coldhead> ?g jqfundamentals @ Beginner
[21:54:27] <bot-t1> Beginner, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[21:54:34] <coldhead> that's not a printed book but it's pretty great
[21:54:42] <rfw> is there any way to get around this?
[21:54:48] <coldhead> 30something going on 80something
[21:55:00] <rfw> or do i have to just make a new deferred and use .then
[21:55:30] <abjorn> coldhead is new 'round here
[21:55:50] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:55:54] <abjorn> ^
[21:56:03] <Beginner> Fundamentals looks pretty straight forward and easy enough for me.
[21:56:07] <abjorn> I've been using jQuery since 1996
[21:56:14] <abjorn> trufax
[21:56:35] <Beginner> I didn't even know it's been around since then
[21:56:46] <abjorn> thatsthejoke.jpg
[21:56:58] <Beginner> lol
[21:57:11] <coldhead> JPEGs were around then
[21:57:17] <abjorn> That they were
[21:57:24] <Beginner> and jokes have been around since before
[21:57:25] <abjorn> and they were usually file.JPEG
[21:57:31] <coldhead> let's pause a moment to reflect on the JPGs of yesteryear
[21:57:33] <abjorn> because file extensions need to be uppercase.
[21:57:40] <abjorn> they needed to be uppercase back then
[21:57:42] <abjorn> no one remembers that
[21:57:43] <rfw> anyone? i come from twisted where exceptions in deferreds turn into errbacks
[21:57:43] <abjorn> but I do
[21:58:03] <Beginner> I didn't get into computers until 2004 probably
[21:58:03] <abjorn> your first mistake was using twisted
[21:58:20] <abjorn> I didn't use computers in 1996 because I was 5.
[21:58:25] <coldhead> danheberden: you know about deferreds, help rfw
[21:58:33] <Beginner> I've been doing IT since and programming. Up until last year I started getting into webdevelopment
[21:59:08] <abjorn> anyways, time for bed. gots work in the morn'
[21:59:19] <Beginner> Alright thanks for your help!
[21:59:20] <coldhead> goodnight babe
[21:59:30] <Beginner> lol
[22:01:33] <coldhead> sorry, rfw, i guess none of the deferred experts are conscious at the moment
[22:01:42] <coldhead> the US is sleeping and europe is waking up
[22:01:46] <TofuTurkey> When I use: $("#newFolder input[type=reset]").click(function(event) {  even tho I am using event.preventDefault();, I get empty values on the the form input fields, even on hidden fields, any ideas ?
[22:01:48] <rfw> coldhead: aw, okay
[22:01:50] <coldhead> and everyone else is terrible
[22:01:57] <rfw> thanks for trying :)
[22:02:18] <coldhead> rfw: try either posting to forum.jquery.com or asking again here in about 8 hours
[22:02:25] <rfw> alright
[22:02:33] <coldhead> ajpiano and danheberden know the score
[22:02:38] <coldhead> if you can catch them
[22:04:48] <makeshiftwings> Hey all! I was just here asking about the jquery tool "Masonry" to stack divs. I got it working... except for animation. I think I am not properly calling the proper jquery UI... what do I need to call to get the animate() function?
[22:11:50] <SeanJM> how do I select an element I just created/prepended to another element?
[22:14:12] <SeanJM> basically, I am creating a new table row, only--the event isn't being triggered for that new element
[22:14:46] <SeanJM> I've looked around and what I am trying to do now is select it, assign it an .on event to achieve the same thing
[22:25:58] <SeanJM> anyone ever ran into that problem with new dom elements not triggering events?
[22:26:47] <mindis|wurk> errrrm, if you mean when using live(), on() etc. then no
[22:29:32] <troubleman> coldhead: whats up with your spine?
[22:30:51] <coldhead> i think this office chair was designed for invertebrates
[22:31:15] <troubleman> hehe
[22:35:27] <SeanJM> yeah, I'm trying to use on
[22:36:09] <SeanJM> so I create an element using prepend, then I am trying to select that element. That is where I am having trouble
[22:43:30] <guy> $('#wrapper').on('resize', function(){
[22:43:57] <guy> doesn't seem to be triggered. It is not implemented in jQuery by default?
[22:44:29] <Cork> guy: it is, its the dom that doesn't have it
[22:44:40] <Cork> guy: resize only exist on the window object nativly
[22:44:46] <guy> so I need to user interval to check it manually?
[22:44:54] <guy> use*
[22:44:55] <Cork> guy: jquery.ui adds it to many of its elements though
[22:45:27] <Cork> guy: you sould trigger it when you change the content of the page, and listen for window.onresize
[22:45:41] <Cork> guy: that way you should catch all changes to its dimentions
[22:46:09] <guy> what will actually trigger window.onresize? (well, I will debug that in a minute) But will any content-height change trigger it?
[22:46:22] <Cork> guy: if the browser window changes size
[22:46:48] <guy> Exactly, which will never happen unless user does that by stretching the window.. how is that useful?
[22:47:19] <Cork> guy: cause thats the only thing you as a developer can't know yourself
[22:47:25] <Cork> guy: you have to be notified about it
[22:47:44] <Cork> guy: if you change the content of the page, you know you do, and then you know you need to check the dimentions
[22:48:19] <guy> Is there a simple way to bind to detect the number of visible elements?
[22:48:21] <Cork> guy: you can still handle it as an event
[22:48:29] <Cork> guy: not bind no
[22:48:56] <guy> well, interval would work, though in that case I'd prefer to simply check height of the wrapping element.
[22:49:08] <coldhead> SeanJM: you generally want to do your on() bind before you add the elements, like somewhere else complely
[22:49:37] <Cork> guy: interval sucks, big time, why force wake up of the users computer when nothing happen
[22:49:38] <coldhead> SeanJM: and then your selector just needs to be whatever you'll eventually be adding: $('#dynamic_table tr').on(.. or whatever
[22:50:00] <Cork> guy: use the event system, and do $(elm).trigger('resize') when you do things that modify the sizes
[22:50:01] <guy> "06:48 Cork: guy: not bind no" then I am not sure how to do that otherwise
[22:50:15] <guy> I was referring to the number of visible elements, just in case.
[22:50:19] <Cork> guy: by making sure you know when it happens
[22:50:41] <Cork> guy: it should be farly simple to know when an element is shown or hidden
[22:50:56] <guy> oh. right. well, this is just pain in an.. though, I see the point. It is coder friendly vs user friendly experience.
[22:51:14] <mindis|wurk> coldhead what if you define the event when the new element is added with just click() instead of on()? does it cause problems if the element is removed?
[22:52:32] <Cork> guy: i do agree it would be sweet if all elements had resize, but i realize easily, that it would cost loads of performance to trigger all those events everytime something on the page changes
[22:52:51] <coldhead> mindis|wurk: no, that's fine
[22:52:56] <Cork> guy: and thats why they don't have it
[22:53:03] <guy> most likely.
[22:53:36] <guy> was just hopping to out smart FB.Canvas.setAutoGrow (Facebook JS SDK method).
[22:55:42] <makeshiftwings> Can anyone think of a way to feature multiple feeds from twitter users on one page? Like a wall of various people's most recent tweets.
[22:55:53] <makeshiftwings> One module for person a, one for person b, etc...
[22:57:44] <coldhead> makeshiftwings: can you just use multiple instances of a twitter widget?
[22:57:48] <coldhead> one per user?
[22:58:36] <makeshiftwings> yeah
[22:58:44] <makeshiftwings> with their 3-4 most recent tweetsw
[22:58:47] <makeshiftwings> tweets*
[22:59:01] <coldhead> i am trying to recover a link i saw yesterday with something like that, makeshiftwings
[22:59:32] <makeshiftwings> awesome, thatd be great. i've tried just using the Twitter Profile widget and customizing it... but it has stopped working (I don't think that was the best way to do it anyway)
[22:59:42] <coldhead> makeshiftwings: http://daniel.brockman.se/
[23:00:03] <coldhead> oh, that's not as similar in reality as it was in my memory
[23:00:34] <coldhead> something like this: http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/
[23:00:38] <coldhead> there are lots of plugins that do that
[23:02:12] <makeshiftwings> well, I've seen the seaofclouds one before
[23:02:20] <makeshiftwings> i wonder though, is it okay to just copy the code over and over again?
[23:02:58] <SeanJM> solved my selection problem. var newTr = document.createElement('tr'); <---- using $(newTr) to select it. Problem solved.
[23:03:14] <coldhead> makeshiftwings: i assume so, they have multiple instances on their demo page
[23:03:22] <coldhead> they probably know what the hell they're doing
[23:03:37] <coldhead> good work, SeanJM
[23:03:42] <coldhead> that's a nice solution
[23:04:17] <coldhead> i'd do var newTr = $('<tr />') and get it in one
[23:04:21] <coldhead> but that's just me
[23:04:26] <jaequery> how can i change jquery library to use a different variable jQuery to something else, like xQuery?
[23:04:43] <coldhead> ?noconflict @ jaequery
[23:04:44] <bot-t1> jaequery, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[23:04:52] <jaequery> no without using noconflict
[23:05:00] <jaequery> i want to completely have my own namespace
[23:05:25] <coldhead> var xQuery = jQuery.noConflict(true)
[23:05:31] <coldhead> that should do what you want
[23:05:41] <coldhead> or i misunderstand
[23:06:09] <jaequery> yea like i said without using no conflict
[23:06:19] <jaequery> i want my own library
[23:06:56] <coldhead> you want to s/jQuery/xQuery/ in jquery.js then?
[23:06:59] <jaequery> for some reason, just doing search/replace jQuery to xQuery doesn't work
[23:07:06] <coldhead> that really should work
[23:07:13] <jaequery> well try it
[23:07:17] <coldhead> like if there string 'jQuery' doesn't appear in the file
[23:07:31] <coldhead> it shouldn't be able to call itself jQuery
[23:07:40] <jaequery> thats what i thought
[23:10:59] <DofLeFou> content is is this correct? …. data: JSON.stringify({ url: url, asset: asset, content: content }),
[23:11:25] <DofLeFou> the syntax
[23:11:43] <Cork> DofLeFou: yes
[23:12:03] <DofLeFou> finally
[23:12:10] <Cork> DofLeFou: is this arguments to ajax?
[23:12:19] <DofLeFou> yes
[23:12:24] <DofLeFou> ajax post
[23:12:32] <Cork> then you can simplify it alot
[23:12:37] <Cork> data: { url: url, asset: asset, content: content },
[23:12:50] <DofLeFou> won't wrok
[23:12:54] <Cork> it does
[23:12:57] <DofLeFou> some escape issue
[23:13:12] <Cork> oh wait, the first one won't work
[23:13:24] <Cork> and it wouldn't be the same as the last
[23:13:30] <DofLeFou> data: JSON.stringify({ url: url, asset: asset, content: content }), working for me
[23:13:51] <DofLeFou> content can have any special caracter
[23:13:51] <Cork> you want samething like data: { json: JSON.stringify({ url: url, asset: asset, content: content }) },
[23:14:16] <DofLeFou> yeah the data type is already specified as Json in my request
[23:14:32] <Cork> DofLeFou: ya, but your sending data as params
[23:14:36] <coldhead> it works for me, jaequery http://jsfiddle.net/AVrE5/1/
[23:14:38] <Cork> and params is key:value pare
[23:14:46] <coldhead> that's including: http://coldhead.ninth.su/xquery.js
[23:14:47] <Cork> just encoding json and sendint that won't work
[23:15:19] <Cork> DofLeFou: alternativly you can do data: "json=" + JSON.stringify({ url: url, asset: asset, content: content }),
[23:15:27] <Cork> DofLeFou: but thats what needed
[23:15:32] <Cork> *whats
[23:15:48] <DofLeFou> ok
[23:15:58] <DofLeFou> thank you cork
[23:16:01] <Cork> np
[23:16:21] <DofLeFou> very new w Jquery
[23:20:56] <muzone> coldhead: nice site
[23:22:45] <coldhead> muzone: which one?
[23:23:01] <muzone> the one with the tshirt art
[23:23:31] <coldhead> ha! you must be the first person in history to know what that was meant to look like
[23:23:33] <coldhead> well done
[23:25:00] <muzone> :-)
[23:28:05] <jaequery> coldhead ah thx, my problem was one of the plugin, was still looking for jQuery :/
[23:31:21] <cactuss> anybody here looking for work? maybe living in nyc?
[23:33:15] <coldhead> cactuss: NYC people are mostly asleep now
[23:34:43] <cactuss> haha yeah i'm over worked, need to hire more people :)
[23:35:18] <cactuss> where are you based coldhead
[23:36:35] <slide> is the Mouse Wheel Extension still supposed to be used? It says its from 2009
[23:36:47] <coldhead> sydney, cactuss
[23:36:50] <cactuss> was that brought into core?
[23:37:09] <coldhead> maybe they got it right the first time, slide
[23:37:14] <coldhead> mousewheels haven't changed much
[23:37:24] <slide> coldhead, i suppose, though id like jquery might have changed since then
[23:37:50] <coldhead> cactuss: you should try pasting a link about the work you're offering here (in a few hours when NYers are conscious)
[23:38:10] <Cork> theres prob better channels to ask in though
[23:38:19] <coldhead> here is fine, Cork
[23:38:24] <Cork> like one of those for-hire channels
[23:38:29] <coldhead> i love reading how much more i should be paid
[23:38:34] <coldhead> and how much more interesting my work should be
[23:38:35] <Cork> lol
[23:38:44] <coldhead> AND ON THAT BOMBSHELL
[23:38:57] <cactuss> what are you doing now?
[23:58:27] <rummik> So, I think I've spotted a glitchy effect in jQuery UI's .sortable(), but I'm not really sure if it's that, or if I'm missing something O.o
[23:58:56] <rummik> http://dnd.dev.rummik.com/ (script: http://dnd.dev.rummik.com/a/d )
[23:59:31] <rummik> Elements are sortable, and may be dragged between other sortables.  The issue comes in with nesting, it seems to bubble up to the parents for whatever reason
