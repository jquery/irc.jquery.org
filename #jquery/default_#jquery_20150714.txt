[01:08:42] <SlexAxton> i have no idea what you're saying
[01:08:43] <rand0m> I've wrote this plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/9krnt5oq/27/
[01:08:57] <rand0m> how can I optimise it ?
[01:09:38] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  did you follow :D
[01:10:00] <Xatenev> hellyeah: lol ye

[01:11:00] <rand0m> idk, when i close it, it folds the div
[01:11:09] <hellyeah> if you have something to make this code better pls tell me i am newbie
[01:11:25] <SlexAxton> rand0m: vertical centering, better indicator of disabled buttons, clean out lines like:
[01:11:26] <SlexAxton> if(($($($gallerySourceItems)[i]).attr("src")) === currentItem){
[01:11:41] <SlexAxton> but there doesn't seem to be a big perf problem
[01:11:46] <hellyeah> rand0m:  i try to do "effect"
[01:11:48] <SlexAxton> if that's what you mean by optimizing
[01:12:15] <hellyeah> when you click button pop up will apear with some animations
[01:14:08] <rand0m> noo

[03:42:38] <Xatenev> rkrara: https://jsbin.com/qokidirupe/1/edit?html,output
[03:42:44] <Xatenev> solution
[03:42:51] <Xatenev> u had a closing div too much on the second page :)
[03:43:08] <Xatenev> so u closed the <div data-role="page" id="two"> instantly after the "This is page two"
[03:43:19] <Xatenev> errors of missing/wrong indention :)
[03:43:25] <Xatenev> indentation*
[03:43:26] <rkrara> @Xatenev thanks
[03:43:34] <rkrara> could you tell me what was wrong
[03:43:37] <Xatenev> I did
[03:43:38] <Xatenev> xD
[03:43:43] <rkrara> thanks a lot
[03:44:26] <Abhijit> i tried to do $("#id").val("new") but this wont add value "new" to my input field?
[03:45:05] <rkrara> @Abhijeet try $("#id").html("new")
[03:45:06] <Xatenev> Abhijit: it does
[03:45:22] <Xatenev> Abhijit: something else is the problem
[03:45:24] <Xatenev> that should work^^
[03:45:26] <rkrara> with ; at the end
[03:45:47] <Xatenev> Abhijit: can u show a fiddle of ur problem?
[03:45:56] <Abhijit> its not working.
[03:46:14] <Xatenev> Abhijit: show a jsfiddle of ur problem plz, cause ur example works :P
[03:46:14] <Abhijit> and its a <input> field . can it use html? or it needs val?
[03:46:22] <Abhijit> let me try
[03:48:16] <rfc19> Hello, is it possible to change the text in an anchor with a class of "link" once clicked? Could I do something like: $(this).text('Changed');
[03:49:23] <Xatenev> rfc19: think so ye
[03:49:48] <Abhijit> nvm. found the problem!
[03:49:57] <Xatenev> Abhijit: :)
[03:49:58] <rkrara> @Xatenev did you used the footer two times to solve my persistent footer/navbar problem
[03:50:14] <Xatenev> rkrara: I took exactly ur example and removed the closing div which was too much
[03:50:17] <rfc19> I keep getting a "cannot read property undefined" error
[03:50:21] <Xatenev> changed nothing else rkrara
[03:50:27] <Xatenev> rfc19: can u show the code on a fiddle or smth?
[03:50:31] <Xatenev> or js bin
[03:50:43] <rfc19> sure
[03:51:03] <rkrara> thanks, but the problem I wanted to fix was to use footer and navbar declaration once and it should work on both page
[03:51:28] <Xatenev> rkrara: what I need is the navbar in footer stays when I navigate to second page, but it does not
[03:51:30] <Xatenev> thats what u wrote
[03:51:39] <rkrara> https://jsbin.com/qokidirupe/edit?html,output
[03:51:54] <rkrara> yes exactly
[03:52:27] <rkrara> according to documentation, I can use the navbar outside so it displayes for all pages
[03:52:31] <rkrara> but its not working
[03:52:32] <rfc19> it works in the fiddle :(
[03:52:51] <Xatenev> rfc19: that helps you :)
[03:52:54] <Xatenev> now u know its something else
[03:52:58] <rkrara> please check the last link
[03:53:01] <Xatenev> or u wrote the wrong testcase
[03:53:06] <Xatenev> rfc19: like not having the same variable names
[03:53:11] <rkrara> actually I meant this
[03:53:17] <Xatenev> rfc19: try to replicate ur problem as good as u can :P
[03:53:35] <Xatenev> I often had that I wanted to show others my problem but left out important things cause i thought they are not important
[03:53:38] <Xatenev> which is just dumb :P
[03:53:40] <rfc19> Xatenev: got it, thank you! I just defined a variable: var $this = $(this) and used it later in my code
[03:53:51] <Xatenev> naise
[03:54:00] <rkrara> here is the link to documentation http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/navbar/#Persistent
[03:54:01] <Xatenev> Im a rubber duck :]
[03:54:01] <Xatenev> xD
[03:55:09] <Xatenev> rkrara: no idea
[03:55:13] <Xatenev> never worked with jquery ui yet
[03:56:08] <rkrara> thats jqmobile not ui
[03:56:42] <Xatenev> or that
[03:56:42] <Xatenev> :d
[03:57:00] <rkrara> anyways thanks for helping, I will figure it out
[03:57:19] <Xatenev> rkrara: but just as an advice, stop working in that jsbin thing
[03:57:21] <Xatenev> and take a proper IDE
[03:57:21] <Xatenev> :P
[03:57:24] <ueber> please help
[03:57:38] <Xatenev> ueber: no idea about ur problem sry^^
[03:57:53] <ueber> Xatenev: ok
[03:58:27] <rkrara> what IDE would you suggest
[03:58:28] <ueber> Xatenev: I need to filter ignoring words order
[03:58:59] <rkrara> I hate when IDE want me to make projects and stuff making text ediing complicated
[03:59:18] <rkrara> i use notepad++ at the moment
[03:59:21] <ueber> if the word is "java test 2000", and the user types "java 2000", it should return it
[04:00:37] <Xatenev> rkrara: PHPStorm
[04:07:50] <rkrara> thanks
[04:08:35] <mdev> <3 notepad++ I use for all my stuff
[04:10:15] <amtrivedi> Hello Everyone,
[04:10:16] <amtrivedi> I have 2 input fields one is for latitude and the other is for longitude, how do I ensure that the value entered by the user in these fields is strictly a number ?
[04:10:44] <taplar> amtrivedi: you could do !isNaN on it
[04:11:45] <Abhijit> how can I know if <video> source exists "Before" rendering that video source on page? In other words render only if exists.
[04:12:35] <taplar> Abhijit: maybe hit a backend endpoint first that returns true or false if the file exists?
[04:13:03] <taplar> Abhijit: well, not true or false, but 200 or 404
[04:13:07] <Abhijit> taplar, that will be a lot of client-server communication because there may be more than 10 or 20 files
[04:13:41] <amtrivedi> taplar: http://dpaste.com/1HHEN0N
[04:13:49] <taplar> Abhijit: only other way i would guess to do that would be to do an ajax call to try to get it first, but if they are large files that could be a non-good thing
[04:14:01] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay this works when I hit enter, but not when I hit tab.
[04:14:20] <taplar> amtrivedi: trim your strings
[04:14:21] <metno> hi guys, i've got a little simple function to fade in between some images, but i want to make it " cross-fade" but cant seem to find out how: http://jsfiddle.net/t2s10rz6/
[04:14:24] <Abhijit> ok
[04:14:36] <metno> the fading now starts, when the first item has ended which results in a black space in between the fades
[04:14:50] <amtrivedi> taplar: What strings, sorry?
[04:14:53] <metno> blank space*
[04:15:05] <taplar> amtrivedi: your input field values are strings
[04:16:38] <taplar> amtrivedi: or wait, does tab add a tab to the value or move you out of the field like normal?
[04:17:12] <amtrivedi> taplar: Hitting a tab takes me to the next input field.
[04:17:37] <taplar> do a console.log to make sure your going in the logic conditional.  you may have the tab keycode incorrect
[04:19:05] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, trying it out.
[04:20:02] <kokut> Hi, is there a plugin or something to monitor the events being fired/captured?
[04:20:29] <taplar> kokut: what's the use case?
[04:20:44] <kokut> taplar not relevant
[04:20:45] <amtrivedi> taplar: YEah, looks like I have the wrong keycode.
[04:21:15] <taplar> i'm never relevant
[04:21:19] <taplar> the question is though
[04:21:44] <kokut> the events as in which script/function is capturing in which line etc
[04:22:19] <taplar> ah, not that i know of.  other than debugging
[04:22:32] <kokut> i dont care if its a click or anything i need to see whats actually happening, using chrome dev tools seems like a good start but you need to play detective
[04:22:58] <amtrivedi> taplar: But the keycode for tab is 9, as evident from various links that I could find.
[04:23:58] <taplar> amtrivedi: i'm getting a zero in my fiddle
[04:24:10] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/wpv335hm/
[04:25:01] <taplar> ah, hold on
[04:25:28] <taplar> yeah, it's keyCode nine
[04:25:48] <taplar> which is zero though
[04:26:52] <peterson_> maybe slightly off-topic, but why can't i do <input name="foo[<script>document.write(counter);</script>]" /> ?
[04:27:06] <amtrivedi> taplar: Still doesn't works :(
[04:27:12] <amtrivedi> Tried 0 this time.
[04:28:34] <amtrivedi> taplar: The if condition isn't satisfied when I hit TAB.
[04:28:46] <taplar> checking
[04:29:21] <rand0m> quick question, when I use a plugin I made in my project, it doesnt work. any clue why ?
[04:30:01] <rand0m> when use the plugin in my script.js file, it works; when I separate it in different file and use grunt to concatenate, it doesnt work
[04:30:07] <taplar> checkLon is misspelled in the conditional
[04:30:15] <rkrara> @amtrivedi http://jsfiddle.net/wpv335hm/ this returns ascii keycode and thats correct code
[04:32:21] <amtrivedi> taplar: Thanks for correcting me, though I am afraid that is still not the solution as it is not entering in the outer if, where I am checking for the keycode values
[04:32:47] <amtrivedi> rkrara: Yes, that is correct, however it isn't working for me :(
[04:33:54] <rkrara> not working in what sense
[04:34:24] <rand0m> nvm it works :)
[04:34:57] <amtrivedi> rkrara: http://dpaste.com/1HHEN0N
[04:35:22] <amtrivedi> When I am on the first input field and if I hit TAB, it takes me to the next input field.
[04:35:45] <amtrivedi> I don't want that. I want to stay on the same input field.
[04:35:50] <Caelum> are animations like fadein done by jqueryui or jquery core?
[04:36:42] <rkrara> use e.preventdefault
[04:36:48] <taplar> amtrivedi: sorry, got distracted with work gossip
[04:36:50] <rkrara> event.preventdefault
[04:37:16] <amtrivedi> taplar: np
[04:37:25] <rkrara> so it should theoritically prevent the default action of tab button
[04:37:30] <taplar> amtrivedi: http://jsfiddle.net/wpv335hm/1/
[04:37:35] <amtrivedi> rkrara: exactly
[04:37:54] <taplar> amtrivedi: i just changed the typo and bound in the javascript rather than the html and it seems(?) to be ok
[04:38:10] <taplar> amtrivedi: also stays on the input on tab
[04:38:16] <rkrara> did you try it already
[04:38:44] <amtrivedi> taplar: Seems line something is wrong with my laptop's tab, still takes me to the next field when I hit tab.
[04:38:53] <amtrivedi> On your fiddle.
[04:39:05] <taplar> amtrivedi: huh, browser?
[04:39:11] <amtrivedi> taplar: Chrome
[04:39:46] <taplar> ok, yeah not working in my chrome
[04:39:49] <taplar> is in firefox
[04:39:57] <Caelum> is there a slideRight() or some such? or only slideDown() ?
[04:41:03] <Caelum> aha jqueryUI can do it
[04:41:25] <taplar> amtrivedi: ok, tab is not firing the keypress event in my chrome
[04:41:51] <amtrivedi> taplar: yes, same with me, so its a browser issue.
[04:42:40] <Caelum> taplar: keypress is not supported on all browsers, try keyup
[04:43:10] <taplar> that did it
[04:43:20] <taplar> still navigated away though, but I did see the alert
[04:48:11] <taplar> amtrivedi: http://jsfiddle.net/wpv335hm/12/
[04:48:30] <taplar> seems to work in both chrome and firefox, though chrome on a failed validate adds a tab space at the end
[04:49:49] <amtrivedi> taplar: Yeah, this is working, thanks a lot :)
[04:49:51] <taplar> part of me wonders if it would just be easier to prevent them from entering non numerics in the first place, :P
[04:50:25] <amtrivedi> taplar: Yeah, I was looking for that earlier, can you suggest away to implement that?
[04:50:31] <amtrivedi> *a way
[04:50:46] <taplar> bind on the 'input' event and evaluate the value, if bad, cancel the event
[04:50:57] <taplar> was what i was thinking
[04:51:31] <amtrivedi> taplar: Can you share a pseudocode, if possible ?
[04:51:37] <amtrivedi> Or a SO link?
[04:51:42] <taplar> hold on
[04:53:17] <taplar> room, is it stopPropagation?
[04:54:47] <taplar> amtrivedi: http://jsfiddle.net/wpv335hm/13/  <-- added some pseudocode to bottom
[04:55:26] <taplar> though that is really close to the actual implementation, lol
[04:56:31] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, looks nice, one question though, this would disable entering of a variable in the input field, right?
[04:56:31] <taplar> typo in the binder, the ) after the second input shouldn't be there
[04:56:57] <taplar> amtrivedi: any input.  you'll most likely want a more granular element selector
[04:57:33] <amtrivedi> taplar: Okay, trying that out.
[04:57:40] <taplar> amtrivedi: like maybe put a class 'numericOnly' on the elements you want to protect and select on that
[04:58:04] <amtrivedi> taplar: yeah, on it.
[04:59:05] <hellyeah> i know it is really simple question
[04:59:14] <taplar> hellyeah: i love those
[04:59:34] <hellyeah> can i write as many function as i like to write inside document.ready function
[05:00:08] <taplar> hellyeah: sure, though you do not have to have your function definitions in a document ready
[05:00:30] <taplar> hellyeah: since function definitions are not executions
[05:00:51] <hellyeah> so just writing lines of code and you are done
[05:00:53] <hellyeah> _
[05:01:01] <hellyeah> no need to function name
[05:01:10] <hellyeah> you can do local var
[05:01:13] <hellyeah> ?
[05:01:21] <taplar> oh, anonymous functions?
[05:01:24] <Caelum> you can have local functions
[05:01:42] <Caelum> var functionName = function(arg) {...};
[05:02:00] <taplar> yeah, your not limited, except for system memory which unless your doing something crazy isn't an issue, or maybe if your on mobile
[05:02:01] <Caelum> then you call it as functionName(arg)
[05:02:21] <hellyeah> i am just new bie
[05:02:33] <hellyeah> i wonder i can define function inside document.ready
[05:02:37] <taplar> sure
[05:02:54] <taplar> document ready is primarily for preventing code from executing until the resources are loaded
[05:03:01] <taplar> it's primary purpose
[05:03:29] <hellyeah> like that http://dpaste.com/17WY9D7
[05:03:40] <taplar> sure
[05:03:48] <taplar> it doesn't care what the code is, :)
[05:03:56] <taplar> it is an uncaring bastard
[05:04:08] <hellyeah> is it good practice to collect all function inside document.read think i have 100 seperate function
[05:04:42] <hellyeah> hope you understand
[05:04:43] <hellyeah> ?
[05:05:18] <taplar> question, what is your intent with doing so?
[05:05:41] <hellyeah> just wondering
[05:05:46] <hellyeah> try to learn stuff
[05:05:53] <hellyeah> writing practical code
[05:06:07] <hellyeah> i am just discovering new world
[05:06:35] <taplar> well it all depends.  i believe functions inside the document ready would be local to that closure/function so if that is fine, then your good
[05:08:05] <hellyeah> well
[05:08:33] <hellyeah> llet me say i write a function which return a number then write another function use return value of pervious function. Still okey doing like that?
[05:08:55] <taplar> sure
[05:10:06] <hellyeah> ic
[05:11:44] <hellyeah> i guess the advantage of document.read function is automatically called. You dont need to call function manually it loads all dom including html, js and css
[05:12:13] <taplar> no, document ready does not invoke functions
[05:12:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:12:26] <hellyeah> function inside document.ready
[05:12:31] <hellyeah> it doesnt invoke it
[05:12:35] <taplar> correct
[05:12:44] <taplar> it executes the creation of the definition
[05:12:56] <taplar> your code inside it will have to actually execute that definition
[05:13:16] <hellyeah> def
[05:13:28] <hellyeah> definition you mean content of document.ready right
[05:13:39] <taplar> yes
[05:13:57] <taplar> well, ok
[05:14:19] <taplar> so document.ready(function(){ /* blah */ })
[05:14:38] <taplar> all document ready does is delays when that internal logic is executed, whatever it is
[05:14:58] <taplar> as far as what the logic inside does, it functions as normal as if it was outside the ready
[05:15:33] <taplar> with the exception that it is inside a function so scope differences do apply
[05:16:59] <hellyeah> ic
[05:18:07] <taplar> confusing as mud?
[05:18:20] <taplar> *clear
[05:18:44] <hellyeah> i am clear
[05:21:20] <hellyeah> taplar:  why it gave rgb(0,0,0) wwhen you change checkbox, checkbox2, checkbox or checbox4 it always gave rgb(0,0,0); https://jsfiddle.net/f24mfe1u/
[05:22:03] <hellyeah> sorry it is so noob question
[05:22:17] <taplar> hellyeah: no need to apologize, :)
[05:22:47] <hellyeah> some people on freenode dont like those type of question :D
[05:23:10] <hellyeah> i expect to get rgb values of blue or orange or red or gray
[05:23:41] <taplar> let me play with it, but I believe it may be looking for the attribute instead of the actual color
[05:24:00] <hellyeah> ic
[05:24:16] <taplar> did you mean to do a conditional on checkbox2 but console log checkbox3?
[05:24:24] <hellyeah> i started using 1.5 weak ago
[05:24:51] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[05:24:53] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/f24mfe1u/1/
[05:25:10] <hellyeah> i forgot to fix it
[05:25:15] <taplar> hellyeah: have you browsed over the jquery basics pages?
[05:25:29] <hellyeah> yes
[05:25:41] <taplar> good deal
[05:26:17] <samssh> hellyeah, Also, before you ask a question, have you tried googleing, and looking up the functions in question on jQuery and MDN?
[05:26:29] <hellyeah> sure
[05:26:33] <hellyeah> i am always there
[05:27:33] <taplar> oh, lol
[05:27:36] <taplar> i think i may know
[05:27:45] <hellyeah> you know?
[05:27:57] <samssh> You're checking the input for color, not the label.
[05:28:03] <taplar> heh, yeah ^
[05:28:07] <hellyeah> oh
[05:28:10] <samssh> :D
[05:28:10] <taplar> you need to do .parent() off of the checkbox
[05:28:11] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[05:28:17] <hellyeah> it is .parent()
[05:28:18] <samssh> ain't I a stinka
[05:28:20] <hellyeah> :D:DD:,
[05:28:38] <samssh> I don't see .parent() anywhere.
[05:29:14] <hellyeah> i forgot
[05:29:24] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/f24mfe1u/2/ here it is
[05:29:40] <hellyeah> actually i did similar thing and use .parent() not i forgot
[05:29:45] <hellyeah> still need pactice
[05:29:48] <notchris> Morning
[05:29:53] <hellyeah> thank you for understanding
[05:29:55] <samssh> Lo and behold, it works!
[05:30:00] <taplar> btw, this --> $('input[id=checkbox2]')  could be simply $('#checkbox2')
[05:30:00] <hellyeah> and being polite
[05:30:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am pacticing actually i know that usage
[05:30:30] <hellyeah> just try to learn every possible way
[05:31:21] <samssh> hellyeah, In the case of ids, it should always be '#foo', rather than 'el[id="foo"]'.
[05:32:53] <hellyeah> samssh:  got it
[05:32:58] <hellyeah> can i ask why?
[05:33:12] <taplar_> bah, stupid network
[05:33:49] <samssh> '#foo' doesn't make the assumtion that there could be more than one id. Since there should never be more than one of an id, that is the correct assumtion.
[05:34:12] <hellyeah> assumption?
[05:34:21] <samssh> Yeah, that word.
[05:34:21] <taplar_> hellyeah: only one element on a page can have a given id
[05:34:33] <hellyeah> yes
[05:34:39] <hellyeah> what about this
[05:34:50] <taplar_> hellyeah: there are no exceptions to that
[05:34:52] <slax0r> no, more elements CAN have the same ID. there SHOULD be only one element with an ID per page though
[05:35:02] <hellyeah> var x = $('checkbox'); produce a NodeList
[05:35:13] <taplar_> slax0r: go and get technical, :P
[05:35:18] <samssh> Also, '#foo' can be faster because it uses getElementById(), which is a very speedy method.
[05:35:20] <slax0r> nothing is stoping you from having multiple elements with same ID, which is sad actually
[05:35:33] <slax0r> if that happens browser should just decide not to show your page, done
[05:35:40] <samssh> slax0r, lol
[05:36:03] <samssh> I like the recent call for Adobe to completely depreciate flash.
[05:36:10] <notchris> There are instances where two elements can exist with the same ID temporarily
[05:36:48] <slax0r> you should burn in hell if it happens to you then :P
[05:37:06] <slax0r> and ID is an ID...in no other branch can there be multiples of same ID on anything
[05:37:08] <taplar_> samssh: i so wish it would die.  it seems every week my firefox is disabling my adobe cause i need to update to the latest
[05:37:09] <slax0r> except html
[05:37:10] <notchris> That‚Äôs a harsh punishment for a minor action
[05:37:24] <hellyeah> nice !
[05:37:27] <hellyeah> i did that
[05:37:36] <slax0r> notchris: what can I say, I'm harsh :P
[05:38:00] <hellyeah> folks function i try to write between line 190 and 199 care to look? http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/93/
[05:38:18] <hellyeah> btw
[05:38:32] <hellyeah> i wouldnt same id for different element ever.
[05:38:52] <hellyeah> i a using asp.net and asp.net probably didnt produce any code like that :D
[05:39:41] <taplar_> hellyeah: i don't see an html element with an id of 'checkbox'
[05:40:43] <hellyeah> check line 177 on html part
[05:41:17] <taplar_> huh, firefox find failed me
[05:42:18] <taplar_> looks like it is executing
[05:42:20] <taplar_> what's the issue?
[05:43:12] <hellyeah> no issue
[05:43:21] <hellyeah> i just want to show it .D
[05:43:30] <hellyeah> code is litte messy sorry about that
[05:43:46] <hellyeah> html table part does not belong to me btw
[05:44:03] <hellyeah> the only problem i may have this works all on browser
[05:44:08] <taplar_> you got document readies in your document ready...
[05:44:25] <hellyeah> i will seperate my functions into files
[05:44:32] <hellyeah> seperate file
[05:44:37] <taplar_> k
[05:44:42] <hellyeah> just a quick info click not active button
[05:44:46] <hellyeah> you can click me
[05:44:52] <hellyeah> or image button
[05:44:52] <rkrara> sorry if I am late here is the tab preventing function https://jsbin.com/munahu/2/edit?html,output
[05:44:53] <taplar_> woah, i barely know you
[05:45:07] <taplar_> i don't click strangers
[05:45:16] <hellyeah> no problem :D
[05:45:19] <hellyeah> thanks anyway
[05:45:22] <rkrara> it prevents action of tab key on input field
[05:45:24] <taplar_> :)
[05:47:24] <taplar_> rkrara: it is recommended to not do the binding in your markup to segregate your markup and your business logic
[05:50:21] <notchris> How would I trim an array so that it only shows every x items ?
[05:51:09] <taplar_> notchris: you mean get a subset?
[05:51:24] <notchris> taplar_: Well here‚Äôs an example
[05:51:35] <samssh> notchris, How about running .filter, and using a modulus of the index.
[05:51:58] <notchris> http://rocketb.in/paste/VzZq3R
[05:52:15] <notchris> The issue is that, the pattern is the same, although the first time there is a ‚Äú‚Äù as the first item
[05:52:39] <notchris> Basically, I want to remove ‚Äú#‚Äù ‚ÄúTickets‚Äù ‚ÄúTicket‚Äù ‚ÄúType‚Äù ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù
[05:52:54] <notchris> Which happens every‚Ä¶ 5 times
[05:52:59] <notchris> Every 5 items
[05:53:40] <taplar_> notchris: in that case, yeah it might be easiest to do a filter and return false if the value is one of those
[05:53:52] <notchris> Hmm
[05:54:23] <taplar_> notchris: otherwise you'd have to do some sort of looped slice() ing of the array
[05:54:29] <taplar_> to get only what you want
[05:54:42] <notchris> right
[05:54:48] <notchris> I‚Äôm making a fiddle to test filter
[05:57:30] <samssh> notchris, Can be done the way I said, though your example paste doesn't reflect these items being every 5. filter(function(v, i, arr){ return (i - 1)%(repeatingLength) < (where the sequence starts) ? true : false });
[05:57:51] <samssh> That solution won't work out of the box, but you get the idea.
[06:01:06] <notchris> return value != "";
[06:01:17] <notchris> How do I specify multple things that it is not equal to
[06:01:42] <taplar_> notchris: you can do ["value1", "value2"].indexOf(value) < 0
[06:01:44] <rkrara> @notchris use &&
[06:01:52] <notchris> Hmmm
[06:02:25] <notchris> return value != "" && "Tickets";
[06:02:26] <notchris> ?
[06:02:39] <taplar_> no you'd have to repeat the value != also
[06:02:43] <notchris> Ohh
[06:02:55] <notchris> That seems like it could have been made simpler in the language
[06:03:07] <taplar_> see my example, :P
[06:03:54] <samssh> notchris, Having to list the comparison multiple times is pretty common in programming languages.
[06:04:34] <notchris> taplar_: Works like a charm
[06:04:38] <notchris> TY samssh taplar_
[06:04:59] <notchris> So now that my array is how I would like
[06:05:05] <notchris> How do I do something with every 5 items
[06:05:55] <samssh> notchris, Loop with modulus
[06:06:25] <samssh> (Where loop is any loop or iterator, depending on what you need to do.)
[06:07:21] <zfmf> hi whats the best way to show jqueryui resizable handles as icons or a circle
[06:40:58] <ueber> hi there
[06:41:20] <hellyeah> hey
[06:42:15] <ueber> I'm using combobox with autocomplete, and I need to filter rows with typed words in "any" order
[06:42:27] <ueber> I made a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/v2zhhsjd
[06:45:11] <ueber> latest is here http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/v2zhhsjd/1
[06:48:27] <ueber> I need to make combobox autocomplete work like google, it should search words typed in "any" order
[06:48:45] <piXonix> sorry I never got back to you yesterday...meeting went way longer than it was supposed to
[06:48:58] <piXonix> I was close on a solution nd will try and find some time to send you a fiddle today
[06:50:03] <notchris> How do I split 1 array into 3 arrays
[06:50:16] <notchris> With 5 items per array
[06:51:28] <piXonix> @notchris: can you jsut store the data from the beginning in a multi-dimentional array?
[06:51:41] <piXonix> rather than splitting it?
[06:51:47] <notchris> I need to split it
[06:51:53] <ueber> piXonix: ok thank you
[06:51:53] <notchris> I just want 3 arrays from one array
[06:52:04] <notchris> the array being split has 15 items
[06:52:08] <notchris> So each one should have 5
[06:52:48] <piXonix> you will need to use array.slice
[06:53:11] <piXonix> basically it ells the array to slice based on a starting position and end count
[06:53:37] <notchris> But if I do arr.slice(0,5)
[06:53:45] <notchris> I will only get the first array with 5 items
[06:53:50] <notchris> Not the last 2 arrays
[06:53:57] <samssh> notchris, So you do it three times.
[06:53:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:54:09] <notchris> OK but what if there are 25 items
[06:54:11] <piXonix> you need to loop through 3 times,and incrememnt your last by x + 5
[06:54:15] <notchris> And I‚Äôve only told it to do it 3 items
[06:54:30] <samssh> notchris, Then that's beyond the scope of the question you asked before.
[06:54:45] <notchris> No, I said I wanted every 5 items in one array into separate arrays
[06:54:47] <notchris> Which would be
[06:54:49] <notchris> array / 5
[06:55:01] <samssh> "<notchris> How do I split 1 array into 3 arrays"
[06:55:22] <samssh> "<notchris> the array being split has 15 items"
[06:55:41] <samssh> We answered the question you asked.
[06:56:08] <notchris> notchris	OK but what if there are 25 items
[06:56:13] <notchris> notchris	And I‚Äôve only told it to do it 3 items
[06:56:23] <samssh> Now, as for splitting into an arbitrary number of arrays of five items, then you do need to do it a little differently.
[06:57:03] <notchris> hmm
[06:57:12] <samssh> I'd recommend looping splice until you run out.
[06:57:27] <notchris> How do I loop slice?
[06:57:33] <BillCriswell> notchris: If you're using lodash or underscrore you can use chunk.
[06:58:02] <samssh> A simple while() should do.
[06:58:12] <notchris> Hmm
[06:59:38] <samssh> notchris, Look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/x6jqffeL/
[07:00:13] <samssh> newArrs is an array of your new (5 long) arrays.
[07:00:26] <notchris> Do you need the [] on newArrs
[07:00:29] <notchris> the second time
[07:00:41] <samssh> Yep.
[07:00:47] <samssh> Otherwise you would overwrite it.
[07:01:06] <samssh> You want to push to newArrs, not overwrite it.
[07:01:24] <notchris> Keep getting a js error
[07:01:27] <notchris> from the example
[07:01:32] <samssh> It's equivalent to this: http://jsfiddle.net/x6jqffeL/1/
[07:01:54] <samssh> I didn't write it as a working example. You need data for it to work.
[07:01:58] <BillCriswell> I don't think that syntax is supported in plain js
[07:02:03] <BillCriswell> need .push()
[07:02:15] <samssh> Hrm. Perhaps I've been writing too much PHP.
[07:02:29] <BillCriswell> samssh: haha
[07:02:32] <samssh> >>var ar = []; ar[] = "first";
[07:02:48] <samssh> b>var ar = []; ar[] = "first";
[07:03:01] <BillCriswell> splice is also destroying the original array, otherwise you would need to use slice and upset the start param.
[07:03:10] <samssh> ... This isn't #javascript is it.
[07:03:11] <BillCriswell> update* not upset.
[07:03:23] <BillCriswell> Tis now.
[07:03:26] <BillCriswell> not*
[07:03:44] <notchris> hmm
[07:04:41] <notchris> IT LIVEs
[07:04:46] <notchris> TY BillCriswell samssh
[07:05:15] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure that would get the left overs, so if you have a multiple of 5 it works, but if you have like 14 it would leave off the last 4.
[07:05:44] <samssh> That it would.
[07:05:53] <samssh> *That, it would.
[07:06:02] <notchris> I have multiples of 5 :D
[07:06:06] <BillCriswell> Oh ok wasn't sure if that was the desired result, jumped in late.
[07:06:11] <notchris> TY BillCriswell
[07:06:19] <notchris> now I just need to take each array and create a list
[07:06:24] <notchris> But I think I can handle that
[07:06:45] <samssh> Is there a V8 bot in #jquery?
[07:07:09] <BillCriswell> I have no idea haha... I see a bot used very rarely in here.
[07:07:20] <BillCriswell> .js> 'foo'.slice(-2) + 'h'
[07:07:24] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[07:07:31] <BillCriswell> Haha, somehow remembered it.
[07:07:37] <BillCriswell> .js> print 'foo'.slice(-2) + 'h'
[07:07:39] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[07:08:10] <samssh> .js> console.log("hello?");
[07:08:14] <b-ot> samssh: No output.
[07:08:20] <samssh> .js> 1+!
[07:08:21] <BillCriswell> It's being a butthole.
[07:08:24] <samssh> .js> 1+1
[07:08:24] <b-ot> samssh: No output.
[07:08:29] <b-ot> samssh: No output.
[07:08:38] <samssh> Yeah
[07:08:45] <samssh> b-ot, stop being rude.
[07:09:44] <Uhkis> js> print 1-1;
[07:09:47] <b-ot> Uhkis: No output.
[07:10:07] <samssh> js>.$%^&$>%^>^$%^$%^*(#%^(#
[07:10:16] <Uhkis> js> print 'im a rude bot';;
[07:10:19] <b-ot> Uhkis: No output.
[07:10:31] <samssh> Now it's just ignoring me!
[07:10:38] <Uhkis> :)
[07:11:10] <prohobo> js> console.log('mexico');
[07:11:14] <b-ot> prohobo: No output.
[07:11:30] <prohobo> js> print 'mexico';
[07:11:33] <b-ot> prohobo: No output.
[07:11:36] <prohobo> oh you're a dick
[07:11:43] <Uhkis> js> print('im a rude bot');
[07:11:46] <b-ot> Uhkis: im a rude bot
[07:11:50] <prohobo> wow
[07:11:50] <Uhkis> HAHAA
[07:11:54] <arc_> i was wondering how long it would take someone to figure that out
[07:12:55] <samssh> I was wondering about using print like that, but I don't use b-ot, so I wasn't going to say anything.
[07:13:18] <Uhkis> guess the syntax game is always fun
[07:13:21] <samssh> js>print('this ain't python (2)")
[07:13:27] <samssh> js>print('this ain't python (2)')
[07:13:37] <samssh> js> print('this ain't python (2)')
[07:13:40] <b-ot> samssh: No output.
[07:13:44] <samssh> js> print('this ain't python (2)');
[07:13:48] <b-ot> samssh: No output.
[07:13:57] <Uhkis> syntax error there
[07:13:59] <samssh> js> print("this ain't python (2)");
[07:14:01] <b-ot> samssh: this ain't python (2)
[07:14:08] <samssh> Yeah, I'm a moron.
[07:14:54] <prohobo> double quotes only?
[07:14:56] <prohobo> what is this
[07:15:15] <Uhkis> no, it had unescaped apostrophe
[07:15:16] <samssh> prohobo, I used a single quote in my phrase.
[07:15:26] <samssh> *apostrophe
[07:15:34] <prohobo> oh -_-
[07:15:35] <samssh> demothenese.
[07:15:49] <prohobo> i was about to go on a tirade
[07:21:16] <ueber> please help me modify autocomplete combobox
[07:22:34] <pzlz> Thoughts on the jQuery 3.0 release?
[07:22:34] <ueber> it should match entered keys in any order
[07:30:50] <samssh> pzlz, deferred being promise compatible is a nice step.
[07:39:45] <hellyeah> hey
[07:39:48] <hellyeah> anyone around
[07:41:16] <Uhkis> ?anyone
[07:41:16] <b-ot> Uhkis: Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[07:42:40] <hellyeah> can you take a look between 180 and 200 all checkboxes is market default and row need to be animated but it doesnt wokr http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/98/
[07:47:13] <peterson_> i have: var $forms = $('form'); and then iterating over them, and in the loop i have $f = $forms[$i]; why can't i do $f.parents('foo') - as it complains that .parents is not a function?
[07:50:33] <Uhkis> you want f = forms.eq(i) probably
[07:55:15] <peterson_> uhkis, thanks, it wasn't parents that i wanted, but a child! so stupid mistake!
[07:55:39] <peterson_> is it possible to trigger an event function for a different element, passing in a particular element?
[07:57:07] <Brodingo> ?trigger
[07:58:47] <Cork> ?api trigger
[07:58:47] <b-ot> Cork: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[08:01:02] <hellyeah> this way ($("#checkSurfaceEnvironment-1").prop('checked') == true)
[08:01:04] <hellyeah> or
[08:01:15] <hellyeah> ($('#checkbox').is(":checked"))
[08:01:21] <hellyeah> whic one is more handy
[08:01:42] <peterson_> thanks
[08:01:43] <Cork> hellyeah: the former
[08:02:05] <Cork> hellyeah: also if you have the dom element just do elm.checked
[08:02:09] <hellyeah> formet?
[08:02:17] <hellyeah> former?
[08:02:24] <hellyeah> what does that mean
[08:02:28] <Cork> former, as in the prior
[08:02:37] <Cork> as in the first one you listed
[08:03:01] <hellyeah> ic
[08:04:40] <ueber> hey guys
[08:05:08] <ueber> ever modified autocomplete combobox
[08:05:29] <ueber> ?
[08:05:41] <Cork> by combobox do you mean the dropdown from the autocomplete or what?
[08:07:26] <hellyeah> Cork:  are you available for a moment
[08:07:49] <Cork> hellyeah: not for bigger thinks no
[08:08:00] <ueber> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/v2zhhsjd/1/
[08:09:19] <ueber> Cork: here is the official page https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[08:09:44] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/101/ can you check between 188- 200 click button you will see al row animated "orange, red, grey" and click "click me" you will see all checkbox is checked i try to reach else condition for disabling animation when i unchecked first checkbox but not able to do it can you take a look?
[08:11:04] <ezek2k4> Hi, I have a field that has an "Id" ex: <input name="dev[12345][devusername]" type="text" id="dev_12345_devcompany" value="" size="38" class="auto_dev_company" onChange="populateDev(12345)"> is there a way to add something like data-id="12345" to the field and get that with jquery instead of doing onchange
[08:11:09] <Cork> ?ask @ ueber
[08:11:28] <ueber> Cork: ?
[08:14:14] <Cork> ueber: that trigger is meant to give you:
[08:14:18] <Cork> ueber: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:14:40] <ueber> Cork: I asked many times
[08:14:43] <Cork> but as always the bot is broken
[08:15:02] <Cork> ueber: you asked if someone knew about combobox == topic experts
[08:15:23] <Cork> and yes you will sometimes have to ask multiple times to get an answer on irc
[08:15:30] <Cork> it comes with the communication form
[08:15:52] <ueber> I need to make it match rows containing entered words, no matter in which order
[08:17:03] <Cork> ezek2k4: not sure what you mean, yes you can add a data-id, but what would that have to do with onchange?
[08:17:22] <ueber> for example, "java" "java 2000" "java test" "java test 2000" should match all
[08:17:23] <ezek2k4> i mean with jquery how i get the id
[08:19:14] <Xatenev> !ask @Xatenev
[08:19:18] <Xatenev> ?ask @Xatenev
[08:19:23] <ezek2k4> it works this way, that field has an autocomplete list, when someone select the contact name it makes an ajax call and then populate the name, address, phone etc fields
[08:19:48] <ezek2k4> but its dynamic thats why i need to get the id to complete the good fields
[08:21:08] <ueber> the autocomplete combobox should "contain" entered values...
[08:21:24] <ezek2k4> so basically i need that when the selection is made i need to set the id to a var so i can populate the correct fields
[08:21:29] <ueber> any idea how to fix my fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/v2zhhsjd/1/
[08:21:39] <Cork> ueber: the code you have to modify is on line 76 and 79
[08:22:28] <ueber> Cork: no loop required ?
[08:22:32] <Cork> i don't remember from the top of my head what regex string $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRege generates
[08:22:36] <Cork> but that is where you come from
[08:22:42] <Cork> ueber: not really
[08:23:08] <ueber> Cork: please edit it
[08:23:15] <Cork> no i don
[08:23:20] <Cork> don't have time for that
[08:24:04] <ueber> Cork: :(
[08:25:35] <ezek2k4> something like this on the autocomplete, var thisid = $this.getAttribute('data-id') or ui.item.getAttribute('data-id')
[08:26:34] <Cork> ezek2k4: in the data for the autocomplete you can store the extra values
[08:26:43] <Cork> then you can just reference that value on select
[08:27:19] <Cork> [{ label: "", value: "" myCustomID: 1 },{...}]
[08:27:22] <Cork> opps
[08:27:26] <Cork> [{ label: "", value: "", myCustomID: 1 },{...}]
[08:28:15] <ezek2k4> the thing is that the autocomplete list is shared so i cant give a custom id
[08:28:33] <Cork> uh...
[08:28:36] <ezek2k4> like i will have maybe 3 time a field that will share the same list
[08:28:40] <Cork> then what would it have to do with ui.item??
[08:29:27] <ezek2k4> nothing hehe that was a bad example because i use that for the ajax call
[08:29:37] <Cork> ezek2k4: ok, back up a bit, what exactly are you trying to do?
[08:29:58] <Cork> why can't you just use the selects .val() for example?
[08:30:06] <Cork> opps the inputs val
[08:33:15] <ezek2k4> ok i have a form where i can select users from an autocomplete list, when i select the user i do an ajax call and populate the user information fields... like name,address,phone etc.. i can add the users dinamycally, example i decide i want 3 users i will have 3 times the username field and 3 time the user information fields
[08:33:28] <ezek2k4> so the username list is shared for the autocomplete
[08:34:08] <ezek2k4> now to complete the good userinfo field when i select from the autocomplete i need to get the id
[08:34:34] <Cork> why not just do this in the select event?
[08:34:55] <Cork> then you have access to all the data
[08:35:06] <ueber> Cork: should I make a matcher RegExp for each "keyword" ?
[08:35:23] <ueber> var searchKeys = request.term.split(' ');  ??
[08:35:37] <Cork> splitting the term is one option ya
[08:35:41] <xochilpili> hi all
[08:35:42] <Cork> hmm
[08:35:51] <Cork> and with any order...
[08:36:01] <Cork> you might actually need a loop there
[08:36:07] <Cork> regex doesn
[08:36:16] <Cork> doesn't handle reordering well
[08:37:20] <xochilpili> i have a $('#oFrm').on('submit',function(){ }); there's a button in that form, but i have nothing in the code, why does it go back ? is like there's a "history.back();"
[08:37:37] <ezek2k4> thats what i want, i mean if i can select the data-id of the selected field(username field where the autcomplete list is) i can just make the ajax call and simple do $("#devemail"+ thisid +).val(data4[0].email);
[08:37:56] <Cork> xochilpili: if the form doesn
[08:38:01] <ezek2k4> and so on
[08:38:10] <xochilpili> Cork, what?
[08:38:12] <Cork> xochilpili: doesn't have an url it takes the current url by default
[08:38:29] <Cork> stypid ' key... why are they always positioned right next to the enter key...
[08:38:53] <Cork> ezek2k4: i don
[08:38:55] <Cork> GAH
[08:38:59] <ueber> please take a look here http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/v2zhhsjd/2
[08:39:07] <xochilpili> Cork, but the current url is modUsr.php and the prev page is user.php and always go to user.php
[08:39:09] <Cork> ezek2k4: i don't get where the data-id gets into the picture
[08:39:32] <Cork> xochilpili: then you must have something redirecting you or something
[08:39:38] <Cork> that isn't default behavior
[08:40:32] <ezek2k4> ok found a way, var this_id = this.getAttribute('data-id'); did the job. Is to autocomplete the rest of the fields. after the ajax call, like know the sets of fields to autocomplete.
[08:42:21] <ezek2k4> ty
[08:42:41] <ueber> Cork: ?
[08:43:44] <xochilpili> Cork, but i have nothing else
[08:44:41] <xochilpili> ah! damn! now i get it!
[08:44:43] <xochilpili> lol
[09:00:10] <ueber> "my search keywords" should be searched like this on sql "%my%search%keywords%"
[09:01:09] <robertmaxrees> lol this again.
[09:01:12] <taplar> :D
[09:16:10] <taplar> boom!
[09:17:58] <De0Sama> Hello, I'm trying to redirect to a page and grab a get variable on that page, however, the get variable i have contains spaces which come through as '%20'.
[09:18:03] <De0Sama> Is there a way to prevent this?
[09:18:08] <taplar> ueber: http://jsfiddle.net/v2zhhsjd/3/
[09:18:15] <De0Sama> I've tried doing a straight up .replace('%20', ' ');
[09:18:19] <De0Sama> that doesn't seem to work
[09:18:27] <De0Sama> and i've also tried encodeURI();
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> De0Sama you need to use a regular expression to replace all of them.
[09:18:37] <robertmaxrees> or do a decodeURIComponent
[09:18:42] <De0Sama> oh
[09:18:44] <De0Sama> component?
[09:19:03] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[09:19:05] <De0Sama> encodeURIComponent/decodeURIComponent
[09:19:06] <De0Sama> ?
[09:19:09] <robertmaxrees> and you want to decode, not encode.
[09:19:14] <De0Sama> oh
[09:19:17] <De0Sama> i thought you had to do both...
[09:19:18] <De0Sama> haha
[09:19:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:19:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  just decode it.
[09:19:33] <De0Sama> ah, ok. I'll try that. :)
[09:20:08] <ueber> taplar: wow! good solution thanx :)
[09:23:21] <ueber> taplar: excellent
[09:23:29] <De0Sama> robertmaxrees, so, this is a little strange. If i include the get variable into the actual URL it works great!
[09:23:41] <robertmaxrees> De0Sama i have no idea what you're talking about.
[09:23:42] <De0Sama> however, i'm redirecting to the same page, and trying to refresh the iFrame
[09:23:45] <peterson_> i've been battling this for an hour - why doesn't the parent work properly here: ?http://pastebin.com/Y6KvLf4U
[09:23:45] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify?
[09:24:02] <De0Sama> robertmaxrees, the decodeURIComponent thing. :)
[09:24:19] <robertmaxrees> De0Sama right, i don't know what you mean "include the get variable into the actual URL"
[09:24:40] <taplar> peterson_: you know your missing a closing " on your inner div class?
[09:24:49] <De0Sama> robertmaxrees, basically, i have an order form and at the very end of it I want to redirect back to the first step and include the street address of the previous order (so sales people don't have to enter the same information multiple times for apartment buildings)
[09:25:06] <robertmaxrees> De0Sama 'kay.  i'm talking about your code, but okay :)
[09:25:20] <peterson_> taplar: ?
[09:25:23] <De0Sama> robertmaxrees, the quickest way I could think to do this was to do a full page "refresh" by reloading the page, and including the previous order's address as a get variable
[09:25:34] <De0Sama> which works, but it has those '%20' in it
[09:25:40] <taplar> <div class="template-container></div>
[09:25:44] <peterson_> taplar - ahh ignore the html at the top - it was just context
[09:26:03] <peterson_> nil points :p
[09:26:21] <peterson_> got me all excited for a second there
[09:27:04] <robertmaxrees> peterson_ try checking $(this).closest('.dynamic-container') - what do you get?
[09:27:46] <peterson_> robertmaxrees: null
[09:28:04] <robertmaxrees> petersendidit then something else is up.
[09:28:08] <robertmaxrees> your HTML is not what you think it is.
[09:29:07] <taplar> console.log($(this).parent().prop('outerHTML'))
[09:29:22] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(this).prop('class')) - what does this give you?
[09:29:35] <peterson_> robert oh but it is
[09:29:53] <peterson_> robertmaxrees rather
[09:29:57] <robertmaxrees> peterson_ no, it's not.  either your $(this) is wrong, or you have broken markup somewhere :)
[09:30:07] <peterson_> oh, so now it's two things?
[09:30:11] <peterson_> keep going ;)
[09:30:15] <robertmaxrees> i said "either" ;)
[09:30:34] <peterson_> i've just done console.log($(this)) and it's outputting the div
[09:30:55] <taplar> console.log($(this).parent().prop('outerHTML')) <--- what does that give you
[09:34:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ you try this yet, peterson_?
[09:35:04] <peterson_> taplar: not what i expected at all!
[09:35:07] <peterson_> thanks, i'll investigatre
[09:35:12] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[09:35:14] <taplar> :)
[09:35:38] <quarkx> haello
[09:36:03] <taplar> aloha
[09:36:13] <robertmaxrees> ... welp
[09:55:02] <kayyy> Does someone know a jquery plugin like the bootstrap affix plugin? only not for bootstrap
[09:55:54] <robertmaxrees> what does affix do?
[09:56:03] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm.
[09:56:15] <kayyy> if you scroll a bit down then your for example mainmenu is pined to the top of the browser
[09:56:20] <robertmaxrees> http://www.jozefbutko.com/stickynavbar/
[09:56:34] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of "sticky nav" plugins out there.
[09:57:07] <kayyy> awesome! thank you. Didnt searched for "sticky nav" - i searched for "affix menu" :)
[09:57:43] <robertmaxrees> hah
[10:06:42] <gtristan> hi, say I am animating 2 separate elements with calls to $(elt).animate()... is there a simple way I can get a single completion callback for 'whenever both of them are complete' ?
[10:07:18] <robertmaxrees> iirc animations are run with promises, so any technique you'd use for the same concept with ajax calls would work with animate.
[10:07:29] <robertmaxrees> .when(animatePromise1, animatePromise2);
[10:08:00] <shoky> you can also do  $(elements).promise().done(function(){...})
[10:08:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too.
[10:11:03] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, oohhhh... so what is that... var promise1 = $(elt1).animate ({...}); ?
[10:11:23] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:12:06] <gtristan> I havent delved into the promise pattern really... thanks for the tip :)
[10:12:38] <gtristan> I suppose it's something I can also do with a jqXHR object returned from $.get() or such ?
[10:12:48] <gtristan> that is also considered a 'promise' ?
[10:14:38] <taplar> i think jqXHR is the result of a promise, not really a promise itself
[10:15:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR - it implements the promise interface.
[10:16:29] <gtristan> aha ! .promise() is nice... question: Will it trigger some method when an element which has animations queued/running has .stop() called on it ?
[10:16:29] <taplar> oh snap, i was thinking that was one of the parameters available to like done()
[10:16:30] <shoky> gtristan: so yes, it is considered a promise ;]
[10:16:59] <taplar> disregard the crazy taplar
[10:17:00] <robertmaxrees> gtristan should, yes.
[10:17:02] <gtristan> as the .animate() callback does /not/ fire when the given animation is stopped
[10:17:06] <robertmaxrees> .stop() resolves it iirc.
[10:17:20] <robertmaxrees> wait .stop() doesn't resolve it?
[10:17:35] <shoky> it doesn't by default i believe
[10:17:38] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[10:17:43] <shoky> depends on the arguments you pass
[10:17:49] <robertmaxrees> funky.
[10:18:03] <gtristan> depends ?
[10:18:07] * gtristan double checks
[10:18:12] <shoky> cause by default if it's stopped, then the animation has not completed, i guess
[10:18:59] <gtristan> I see
[10:19:05] * gtristan missed that very important bit
[10:19:15] <shoky> .stop(true, true) will call the callbacks,  not sure about .stop(true)
[10:19:24] <gtristan> right
[10:19:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah
[10:20:19] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, indeed
[10:22:38] <shoky> actually sorry, it depends if you're tlaking about the .animate() callback or the $.when/.promise() callback
[10:23:04] <shoky> .stop()  will resolve the $.when/.promise()
[10:23:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay
[10:44:37] <Abhijit> hi
[10:44:44] <Abhijit> how to stop ajax call once it fails?
[10:44:52] <robertmaxrees> it's already stopped?
[10:45:11] <Abhijit> the server logs gives me more than one line saying file 404 not found
[10:45:16] <Abhijit> it should only happen once
[10:45:29] <robertmaxrees> correct.  are you sure you're not calling it more than once?
[10:46:10] <Abhijit> on ajax success i am colling recursive function if ajax fails i am not doing anything
[10:46:41] <robertmaxrees> what's your response on failure?
[10:46:47] <Abhijit> nothing
[10:46:48] <Abhijit> no line of code
[10:46:58] <robertmaxrees> your server response, i mean.
[10:47:20] <Abhijit> "HEAD //static/videos/output.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 404 0
[10:47:22] <Abhijit> so many times
[10:47:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't call more than you tell it to, so it sounds like you might not be responding correct to the client.  can you share an example of the code?
[10:47:56] <Abhijit> I cant. Not my code.
[10:48:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:48:17] <Abhijit> this is just a small function in the whole code. its a whole application in javascript
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> i just want the ajax function.
[10:48:40] <Abhijit> ok
[10:48:47] <gambl0re> hey robertmatrix....would i use ajax to gather data from a google api?
[10:49:12] <Abhijit> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11878785/ robbyoconnor
[10:49:16] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, ^
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  Abhijit check your network tab in your browser to see what's up.
[10:49:57] <Abhijit> ok
[10:50:48] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i don't see that guy active.
[10:50:51] <robertmaxrees> did you mean me?
[10:54:34] <robertmaxrees> oooor not.
[10:58:28] <gambl0re> what exactly is an api?...i've still dont have a clear idea of what it is
[10:59:04] <robertmaxrees> short for "Application Program Interface"
[10:59:08] <gambl0re> ajax allows the browser to retrieve data and update the page without reloading the page...
[10:59:26] <gambl0re> yes i know...
[10:59:31] <robertmaxrees> you know how you call jquery functions like $('something').on()?  or $.ajax()?
[10:59:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery exposes an API for you to use.
[11:00:08] <robertmaxrees> an API is just a set of methods/functions/objects that you can use.
[11:00:17] <gambl0re> the api is what you connect to in order to retrieve data?
[11:00:17] <gambl0re> so you connect to google's api in order to collect and use their data?
[11:00:46] <robertmaxrees> you can set and recieve data, behavior, etc.
[11:00:59] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you can connect to google's apis to access whatever they expose.
[11:01:01] <gambl0re> i want to get weather information for my city from http://openweathermap.org/api
[11:01:37] <robertmaxrees> ijay,
[11:01:39] <robertmaxrees> *okay
[11:01:49] <robertmaxrees> read their docs, then.
[11:02:05] <gambl0re> does my site need to be running on a webserver?
[11:02:12] <robertmaxrees> that'd be ideal.
[11:02:19] <gambl0re> so it wouldnt work on localhost?
[11:02:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:02:38] <robertmaxrees> you can make localhost point to a server.
[11:02:39] <gambl0re> would it work on github-pages?
[11:02:46] <gambl0re> how do i do that..
[11:02:49] <robertmaxrees> could, yeah.
[11:02:55] <gambl0re> ok...
[11:03:01] <robertmaxrees> search google for information on setting up a local webserver.
[11:03:10] <gambl0re> i know apache...
[11:03:15] <robertmaxrees> you can use that, then.
[11:03:23] <gambl0re> i had job interview today...
[11:03:34] <gambl0re> asked me bs questions..
[11:04:08] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[11:05:28] <gambl0re> they're gonna send me some quiz to test my knowledge...you mind if you do it for me?
[11:05:38] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[11:05:47] <robertmaxrees> really?
[11:05:58] <robertmaxrees> do you not see the problems with tha?
[11:06:00] <robertmaxrees> *that
[11:06:48] <gambl0re> ok...
[11:08:05] <gambl0re> ok i got api key...
[11:09:42] <gambl0re> this is exciting..
[11:09:50] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[11:14:44] <gambl0re> in order to retrieve data from an api i can use ajax?
[11:14:52] <robertmaxrees> that depends on the API
[11:15:10] <gambl0re> http://openweathermap.org/api
[11:15:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:15:26] <robertmaxrees> do they offer information about AJAX?
[11:16:23] <gambl0re> whats the name of that plugin where they display json info nicely formatted
[11:16:32] <robertmaxrees> the developer tools?
[11:16:47] <gambl0re> no its a chrome/firefox plugin
[11:16:58] <robertmaxrees> the developer tools work pretty well.
[11:17:05] <robertmaxrees> console.dir() and console.table() are two good options.
[11:21:32] <gambl0re> i dont see anything about ajax...wtf
[11:21:50] <Pizentios> hello
[11:23:52] <Pizentios> i have a jquery mobile project where i have some listviews where the li are appended to the listview (which i have working). I also have click events for the li, which are working for all listviews except one. The code looks exactly the same to me, yet the click event is not firing for one of the listviews. Would there be a reason for this?
[11:24:10] <Pizentios> i have peer'ed over my code all moring with out finding anything
[11:26:00] <gambl0re> i dont see anything about ajax in their api docs
[11:26:08] <piXonix> Pizentios make sure that you are not using $().click
[11:26:23] <piXonix> try using $(document).on(click,[element],function(){});
[11:26:38] <piXonix> that will bind your click to all current and future elements if they are added dynamically
[11:27:07] <Pizentios> piXonix: I am currently using $('#listview_selector).on('click', 'li', function()
[11:27:14] <piXonix> weird
[11:27:16] <piXonix> hmmmm
[11:27:16] <Pizentios> yeah
[11:27:22] <Pizentios> bugging the crap out of me
[11:27:29] <piXonix> wait
[11:27:33] <Pizentios> i can pastebin some code if needed, but it's a pretty large app now
[11:27:38] <piXonix> sorry, switch your outer to $(document).
[11:27:49] <piXonix> it needs to attach to the document level
[11:27:54] <piXonix> or something that remains consistent
[11:27:57] <piXonix> try that
[11:28:05] <Pizentios> so $(document).on('click', '#listview_selector li', function() ?
[11:28:29] <piXonix> yeah, try that
[11:28:42] <Pizentios> k
[11:29:03] <Pizentios> odd part is that syntax works in other parts of my code
[11:29:20] <Pizentios> for almost the same type of situation (just different content)
[11:29:31] <piXonix> perhaps in this case, the elemnt you are binding to in the outer is being changed in the DOM
[11:29:35] <piXonix> for whateverreason
[11:29:37] <Pizentios> kk
[11:29:40] <Pizentios> i am loading it now
[11:30:09] <robertmaxrees> fwiw  $(document).on(click,[element],function(){}); doesn't bind more than once.
[11:30:16] <Pizentios> piXonix: nope, didn't work and i have actually tried this before :(
[11:30:23] <piXonix> even weirder
[11:30:27] <Pizentios> yup
[11:30:30] <robertmaxrees> it binds a single listener to the document that fires if a child element emits that event.
[11:30:52] <Pizentios> 	$(document).on('click', '#site_inventory li' function(e) {
[11:30:58] <Pizentios> thats the exact code
[11:31:06] <piXonix> correct
[11:31:14] <robertmaxrees> how are you seeing if it works?
[11:31:23] <Pizentios> logging to the console
[11:31:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[11:31:42] <Pizentios> hang on and i will make a paste
[11:31:45] <piXonix> that is a common design that we use on a lot of projects where we load data  in and out dynamically, and it hasn't failed us yet
[11:32:04] <Pizentios> i know, i have used the code i posted before in the project on other listviews....
[11:32:08] <robertmaxrees> wonder if the markup is invalid causing issues.
[11:32:10] <Pizentios> i will post and example of both
[11:32:14] <piXonix> if you can bin it, I can have a look
[11:32:22] <Pizentios> kk i will get something to gether
[11:32:29] <Pizentios> pastebin.org ok?
[11:32:49] <Pizentios> #perl doesn't like it lol so i am used to asking what paste people like
[11:32:51] <robertmaxrees> bpaste would be better
[11:32:53] <Pizentios> kk
[11:32:59] <piXonix> that's fine
[11:33:06] <piXonix> I can pull the code out

[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand that spambot.
[11:38:51] <gambl0re> so i would do something like this -> $.ajax([url: 'api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=35&lon=139'])
[11:39:02] <gambl0re> ?
[11:39:08] <robertmaxrees> you'd use curle brackets.
[11:39:11] <robertmaxrees> {}, not []
[11:39:21] <robertmaxrees> try it out in a fiddle or a dev environment.
[11:39:24] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[11:39:35] <gambl0re> i could use jsfiddle?
[11:39:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:41:03] <Pizentios> piXonix: https://bpaste.net/show/ac2107a77586
[11:41:17] <Pizentios> tried to include as much info as i could
[11:41:29] <Pizentios> had to snip it as it would be a huge paste
[11:41:36] <Pizentios> i can paste the entire thing if needed
[11:41:55] <robertmaxrees> and you only have a single site_inventory on the page?
[11:42:00] <Pizentios> yup
[11:42:14] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="site_inventory"]').length <- this gives you 1?
[11:42:29] <Pizentios> i will add that and tell you
[11:42:45] <Pizentios> i do a search in gvim and only finds one
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[11:43:01] <robertmaxrees> run that code on the page itself.
[11:43:04] <robertmaxrees> i care about what gets rendered.
[11:43:13] <Pizentios> kk
[11:43:16] <Pizentios> i will run it now
[11:46:30] <Pizentios> console.log($('[id="site_inventory"]').length); doesn't display anything
[11:46:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#site_inventory').length); <- ?
[11:47:01] <Pizentios> trying now
[11:47:10] <robertmaxrees> if neither of those display naything, you're not even calling that code.
[11:47:43] <Pizentios> i know i am as the click function i have it in is adding to the given listview
[11:47:49] <taplar> holy cow, i missed a the spambot...
[11:52:03] <gambl0re> robertmatrix...what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/dgp02e1s/
[11:52:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't think robertmatrix is around round now...
[11:52:48] <gambl0re> why am i getting error? the url i provided is valid..
[11:53:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to provide a full url.
[11:53:31] <taplar> put http:// at the start
[11:53:32] <robertmaxrees> generally you need to include the protocol.
[11:53:33] <gambl0re> i did..
[11:53:38] <robertmaxrees> not in that fiddle.
[11:54:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dgp02e1s/2/
[11:54:10] <taplar> without that in the fiddle it is trying to hit: http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=524901&APPID=8f937ad714240677c1e258cdef573bb7
[11:54:13] <gambl0re> oh...you're genius..
[11:54:19] <robertmaxrees> don't include body tags in jsfiddle btw.
[11:54:20] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[11:54:54] <gambl0re> ok i fixed it....now how do i get the data to display on the page?
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> write the data oput.
[11:55:10] <gambl0re> do i just jquery? like .append()?
[11:55:20] <gambl0re> or .html
[11:55:50] <robertmaxrees> check the docs to see how you access the returned data.
[11:56:04] <gambl0re> jquery docs or the api docs?
[11:56:09] <robertmaxrees> the jquery api docs.
[11:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you basically want to use .done() here.
[11:57:26] <piXonix> Pizentios did any of the other suggestions help figure out what is going on?
[11:57:51] <Pizentios> trying one now
[12:04:00] <Pizentios> piXonix: currently trying to get confirmation that there is only one #site_inventory element
[12:04:28] <Pizentios> via console.log($('#site_inventory').length);
[12:04:43] <robertmaxrees> that will always only say 1 or 0 fwiw.
[12:04:46] <robertmaxrees> but you said it's not logging anything.
[12:04:51] <Pizentios> yeah
[12:04:58] <Pizentios> even tried to put it in an alert
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> the other version i showed you will show you if there's more than 1.
[12:05:02] <Pizentios> and in different spots
[12:05:09] <Pizentios> still nothing
[12:05:13] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have bigger problems then?
[12:05:15] <Pizentios> yeah
[12:05:21] <Pizentios> trying to figure that out currently
[12:06:15] <gambl0re> robertmatrix...its not wokring http://jsfiddle.net/dgp02e1s/4/
[12:06:37] <gambl0re> its making successful request but im not seeing any data
[12:06:54] <robertmaxrees> lol please get my username right, dude.
[12:07:14] <taplar> gambl0re: the data element your getting is an object
[12:07:23] <gambl0re> im trying man...
[12:07:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dgp02e1s/5/ check this out, gambl0re
[12:07:28] <taplar> Object { city: Object, cod: "200", message: 0.0114, cnt: 40, list: Array[40] }
[12:07:28] <gambl0re> its not working
[12:07:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dgp02e1s/6/
[12:08:05] <robertmaxrees> ypou need to give it strings, not complex objects.
[12:08:51] <gambl0re> your code isnt working also...
[12:09:01] <gambl0re> can you give me an example...this is confusing
[12:09:22] <taplar> looks like robertmaxrees's is working.  it's appending Moscow
[12:09:36] <robertmaxrees> i gave you an example that functions just fine.
[12:09:37] <gambl0re> are you looking in the console or jsfiddle outpuit?
[12:09:42] <robertmaxrees> both
[12:09:42] <taplar> output
[12:11:40] <gambl0re> how did you end up with moscow?
[12:11:58] <taplar> lol
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> open your console and browse the object.
[12:12:09] <gambl0re> is that the city id?
[12:12:11] <gambl0re> haha
[12:13:57] <gambl0re> city.name is a xml parameter. i thought we're using ajax
[12:14:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:14:09] <taplar> it's an object
[12:14:13] <robertmaxrees> you're getting JSON back.
[12:14:19] <taplar> city and name are properties on objects
[12:15:16] <robertmaxrees> also: AJAX is actually short for "asynchronous javascript and xml"
[12:15:18] <gambl0re> you wrote ('p').append(data.city.name);
[12:15:21] <robertmaxrees> even though nobodyuses it for that any more.
[12:15:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:15:27] <gambl0re> city.name is an xml property name
[12:15:34] <robertmaxrees> not in this case.
[12:15:43] <robertmaxrees> they're properties on the JS object you're getting back.
[12:15:58] <gambl0re> in the weather api docs it gives oyu a list of parameters
[12:16:10] <gambl0re> city.name is a JSON paraemter
[12:16:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:16:17] <gambl0re> is not a JSON parameter i mean
[12:16:19] <robertmaxrees> you're using JSON.
[12:16:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:16:29] <robertmaxrees> that's the object coming back from the service duder.
[12:16:33] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[12:16:42] <gambl0re> yes im using json so why are you using xml paramter
[12:16:51] <taplar> it's object notation, not xml
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[12:16:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm using JSON
[12:17:00] <taplar> in this case
[12:17:04] <robertmaxrees> because you're getting back JSON from the service.
[12:17:20] <taplar> you could also do data["city"]["name"]
[12:17:30] <robertmaxrees> which maps to the one i gave you.
[12:18:00] <gambl0re> so you specify which part of the data you want to select by doing data.city.name?
[12:18:12] <gambl0re> then whats the url for $.ajax("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=524901&APPID=8f937ad714240677c1e258cdef573bb7")
[12:18:12] <taplar> yep
[12:18:16] <robertmaxrees> yes.  that's how you access properties in JS objects.
[12:18:20] <gambl0re> i thought that was the point of the url
[12:18:32] <gambl0re> to specify which data you want to retrieve
[12:18:32] <robertmaxrees> the point of the URL is to tell the service what data you want back.
[12:18:35] <robertmaxrees> it then sends you that data.
[12:18:43] <robertmaxrees> in an object.  you then pull data out of that object.
[12:18:46] <gambl0re> but you're specifying the data in the data.city.name
[12:18:59] <robertmaxrees> right, because that's the format they send back.
[12:19:56] <robertmaxrees> they tell you the city name and lots of other useful information.
[12:20:40] <gambl0re> so i do data.(object parameter) to display whichever info i want to show./
[12:20:49] <robertmaxrees> data.propertyName
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:22:52] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/dgp02e1s/8/
[12:23:02] <gambl0re> wtf im trying to show the temperate.value property and its not working
[12:23:39] <gambl0re> how do i see the objects data??
[12:23:47] <gambl0re> http://openweathermap.org/current
[12:23:51] <taplar> in the console or http://jsfiddle.net/dgp02e1s/9/
[12:23:59] <gambl0re> im looking at the JSON parameters....it lists all the different parameters
[12:24:10] <gambl0re> im using main.temp
[12:24:18] <gambl0re> so im trying to use data.main.temp
[12:24:21] <gambl0re> but its not workiong..
[12:24:29] <taplar> gambl0re: what browser are you using?
[12:24:38] <gambl0re> firefox
[12:24:45] <taplar> alright, are you looking at the console?
[12:24:50] <gambl0re> yes
[12:25:02] <taplar> k, do you see the print of the Object {....blah ....} ?
[12:25:08] <gambl0re> no
[12:25:24] <gambl0re> in the jsfiddle?
[12:25:29] <taplar> in your console
[12:25:42] <gambl0re> im seeting Using //@ to indicate sourceURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead
[12:25:52] <robertmaxrees> leave your console open and refresh the page.
[12:25:53] <taplar> with the console open, click the run button in js fiddle, it should console the object
[12:26:00] <gambl0re> TypeError: data.main is undefined
[12:26:04] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:26:24] <gambl0re> yea but why is it undefined...its one of the json parameters
[12:26:30] <gambl0re> specified by the weather api docs
[12:26:32] <taplar> do you see the object print now?
[12:26:45] <gambl0re> no...
[12:26:50] <gambl0re> im running the jsfiddle
[12:26:54] <taplar> in the console, not the fiddle
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> there is no "main".
[12:27:04] <gambl0re> yes im looking in the console
[12:27:10] <gambl0re> let me change it back to data.city.name
[12:27:22] <taplar> run this one with the console open: http://jsfiddle.net/dgp02e1s/9/
[12:27:23] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/NRyxCMR.png
[12:27:33] <robertmaxrees> there's a "main" within each object in .list
[12:27:38] <robertmaxrees> data.list[0].main
[12:27:41] <taplar> you should see this printed: Object { city: Object, cod: "200", message: 0.0114, cnt: 40, list: Array[40] }
[12:27:49] <gambl0re> ok i changed it back to data.city.name and its showing moscow again
[12:27:56] <gambl0re> but i dont see the objects properties
[12:27:58] <gambl0re> in the console
[12:28:03] <taplar> hmm
[12:28:14] <robertmaxrees> take a screenshot.
[12:28:18] <robertmaxrees> because something here is way off.
[12:28:25] <gambl0re> ok wait
[12:28:42] <taplar> or we could have him go to the network tab.  can see the parsed response there too
[12:28:52] <robertmaxrees> their dev tools are broken.
[12:28:54] <gambl0re> TypeError: data.temperature is undefined show:25:2
[12:28:54] <gambl0re> TypeError: data.temperature is undefined _display:25:2
[12:28:54] <gambl0re> TypeError: data.main is undefined _display:25:2
[12:28:54] <gambl0re> TypeError: data.main is undefined
[12:28:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:28:59] <gambl0re> that is the last couple lines
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> a screenshot.
[12:29:05] <robertmaxrees> a picture.
[12:29:08] <gambl0re> screenshot is not necessary
[12:29:12] <gambl0re> thats what its showing
[12:29:13] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[12:29:22] <gambl0re> ok fine!...wait
[12:29:22] <robertmaxrees> you're not understanding something basic about your developer tools.
[12:30:54] <gambl0re> theres a really hot girl sitting in front of me..
[12:31:06] <taplar> we'll take that screenshot too
[12:31:21] <gambl0re> im not a pervert..
[12:31:28] <gambl0re> http://imgur.com/CjY5JjP
[12:31:35] <gambl0re> theres your screenshot
[12:32:07] <cannap> noob
[12:32:36] <taplar> gambl0re: click your "Logging" option to toggle it
[12:32:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah you disabled the log.
[12:33:13] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/fRa2dfz.png enable all of these.
[12:33:16] <gambl0re> oh yes...
[12:33:18] <gambl0re> i see it now
[12:33:19] <robertmaxrees> and read http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:33:21] <taplar> now
[12:33:32] <taplar> if you click the left most Object it will bring up the entire response on the RHS
[12:33:41] <taplar> so you can see the structure
[12:34:27] <gambl0re> its the same info if i just type in http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=524901&APPID=8f937ad714240677c1e258cdef573bb7 in the browser
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:34:39] <robertmaxrees> just easier to read and browse.
[12:35:13] <gambl0re> ok so i want to get the temperature....
[12:35:21] <gambl0re> thats the whole point of this weather api
[12:35:27] <gambl0re> how do i do that?
[12:35:32] <robertmaxrees> browse the object.
[12:35:51] <robertmaxrees> the docs might explain where, too.
[12:37:35] <cannap> step for step console.log(thing.bla);
[12:38:18] <gambl0re> and basically you have to stylize all the info?
[12:38:39] <robertmaxrees> yes you will.
[12:38:40] <taplar> api's generally give you data.  it's up to you what you do with it
[12:39:04] <taplar> more flexible that way
[12:39:05] <gambl0re> isnt there a way to retrieve the data and have it automatically stylized with graphics like with a sun, or clouds, rain, snow etc... depending on the weather like as if you see it on the weather forecaset on tv
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:39:19] <robertmaxrees> then you want some kind of widget from them.
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> which they may or may not support.
[12:39:40] <cannap> you got text
[12:39:43] <cannap> only
[12:39:55] <cannap> the other one costs money
[12:40:09] <cannap> or s
[12:40:13] <taplar> hah, really?  lol
[12:40:15] <cannap> o fuck my ennglish
[12:41:18] <gambl0re> and ajax automatically updates the data at a fixed time?
[12:41:34] <cannap> no
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> ajax runs once.,
[12:41:52] <gambl0re> i thought that was the whole purpose of ajax
[12:41:56] <gambl0re> asynchronus
[12:41:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:42:03] <robertmaxrees> you call it once, it runs once.
[12:42:12] <robertmaxrees> you can call it more than once if you'd like.
[12:42:22] <gambl0re> yea but if its snowing tomorrow i dont want my forecast to still show that its sunny
[12:42:22] <cannap> pls
[12:42:29] <taplar> so call it tomorrow
[12:42:33] <cannap> -.-
[12:42:45] <robertmaxrees> it'll call it every time you load the page.
[12:42:57] <gambl0re> heh??
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> you can also use timeouts to call it again.
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> (don't use intervals btw - manually do timeouts)
[12:43:16] <cannap> ever 5s
[12:43:21] <cannap> every
[12:43:29] <taplar> does weather change that fast?
[12:43:33] <cannap> yes
[12:43:37] <cjohnson> you're right. every 0.5s
[12:43:39] <cannap> ^^
[12:43:39] <cjohnson> be safe
[12:43:41] <taplar> lol
[12:43:42] <robertmaxrees> forecasts can.
[12:43:50] <iCHAIT> Hello everyone, the conventional jquery hide and show aren't working for this code -
[12:43:52] <iCHAIT> http://dpaste.com/3Y9KFFW
[12:43:57] <cjohnson> you'd prob want like a 5m interval realistically
[12:44:05] <iCHAIT> What am I doing wrongly here?
[12:44:13] <cjohnson> in my experience as a consumer of these services it seems like 5m is about how often they actually updated
[12:44:16] <taplar> phsss, just immediately call it again in the done and be..... done with it
[12:44:18] <robertmaxrees> iCHAIT no clue, but use .val() instead of .attr('value', ...)
[12:44:28] <robertmaxrees> and we'd need to see your html, as well.
[12:44:30] <cannap> .val() works
[12:44:42] <cjohnson> iCHAIT: what do you mean it doesn't work? is it unemployed?
[12:44:49] <gambl0re> so the info will load every time the user refreshes the page
[12:44:50] <gambl0re> ?
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re as it is right now, yes.
[12:45:21] <cannap> he append all the shit
[12:45:28] <cannap> woa looks so ugly^^
[12:45:30] <cjohnson> use setTimeout to continually run the refresh function gambl0re
[12:45:41] <cjohnson> at the end of refresh, setTimeout to call refresh again in a few mins
[12:45:49] <gambl0re> ok...
[12:45:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> or just call the ajax again.
[12:46:05] <robertmaxrees> since you didn't want to reload the page.
[12:46:07] <cjohnson> that's what I mean by refresh function
[12:46:11] <gambl0re> what do you mean call ajax again???
[12:46:12] <cjohnson> refresh data
[12:46:24] <cjohnson> call whatever function it is that does that
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson "refresh" can confuse people because they might think you're talking about the window.
[12:46:43] <cjohnson> well I did say refresh function
[12:46:48] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re put the ajax call in a function.
[12:46:53] <robertmaxrees> and call that function.
[12:47:41] <cannap> and cache the damn thing ;)
[12:47:42] <gambl0re> and use setTimeout to call it at a set interval?
[12:47:58] <robertmaxrees> use setTimeout to call it from within the .done() of the ajax call.
[12:48:02] <taplar> if he wants the latest values, why would he cache it?
[12:48:28] <gambl0re> i want it to update atleast every hour or so
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> then use a timeout to call it again in an hour.
[12:49:06] <cjohnson> gambl0re: exactly. function loadWeather() { ... ajax call ... update DOM ... setTimeout(loadWeather, (1000 * 60 * 30) /* 30 mins */); } loadWeather()
[12:49:20] <cjohnson> obviously nest the setTimeout within the callback from the ajax call
[12:51:21] <gambl0re> i see. ok...
[12:51:31] <cannap> how you update the dom with jquery?
[12:51:41] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.
[12:51:56] <robertmaxrees> .html(), .prop(), .attr(), .append(), .text(), .val()...
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to update?
[12:52:16] <taplar> still here iCHAIT ?
[12:52:23] <gambl0re> i always thought it would provide nice graphics for you when you pulled data from a weather api
[12:52:33] <cannap> two way
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re nope.  that API just gives you data.
[12:52:37] <iCHAIT> taplar: yes
[12:53:03] <gambl0re> so it depends on the api then? sometimes they will provide graphics?
[12:53:07] <taplar> iCHAIT: briefly glancing over your code.  i see an error with " $(('#inline_product').append( "
[12:53:13] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re not usually.
[12:53:18] <taplar> iCHAIT: your missing your $ on that selector
[12:54:23] <iCHAIT> taplar: You mean it should be $($('#inline_product')
[12:54:24] <iCHAIT> ?
[12:54:47] <cannap> $ is the same as jQuery
[12:54:56] <taplar> iCHAIT: definately need the inner one, not sure about the outer at this point
[12:54:58] <cannap> it gives you a scanned object from jquery
[12:55:10] <cannap> and then you can go deeper
[12:55:11] <cjohnson> gambl0re: an API is usually for data. if you want it to be the entire UI that would generally be called a "widget"
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we explained that earlier, cjohnson
[12:55:45] <cjohnson> doesn't seem to be getting it :P
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:55:49] <cjohnson> gambl0re: https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+widget&oq=weather+widget&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i65.1060j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#q=weather+widget+javascript  try something like this
[12:55:58] <cjohnson> for a google search
[12:56:35] <gambl0re> i know what a widget is...
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> then that's what you want.
[12:56:46] <gambl0re> i played with wordpress before...
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> sure, and I've trimmed my dog's nails.  doesn't make me a vet ;)
[12:58:16] <cannap> show
[12:58:47] <gambl0re> i have a dog also..
[12:59:01] <cannap> wordpress is php using jQuery but you can use wp without jquery..
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not the point i was trying to make.
[12:59:17] <iCHAIT> taplar: Well, it kind of works, the problem looks like that when i=0 it shows that div, but when the value of i != 0 the hide() overrides the .show()
[12:59:18] <cannap> jquery its only on the FRONT
[12:59:27] <iCHAIT> taplar: I hope you got the problem
[12:59:54] <taplar> right, hide will happen last
[13:00:05] <taplar> provided there are > 1 elements
[13:00:36] <iCHAIT> taplar: exactly, when their is only one element show() works.
[13:00:43] <taplar> so what is the intended result?
[13:01:34] <iCHAIT> taplar: When i=0 it should show the div , but when i != 0 it should hide the div.
[13:01:35] <taplar> are you trying to show/hide the inner elements, or the outer inline_product object?
[13:02:03] <iCHAIT> I want to show/hide the select that you can see in that paste.
[13:02:30] <taplar> the select(s) are nested children.  you are showing and hiding the outer most parent
[13:03:16] <iCHAIT> taplar: Okay, so should I hide particularly the select using their id's? Will that work?
[13:03:34] <taplar> that would be one approach
[13:04:07] <taplar> or create the select(s) in question in a fragment, append it to the result, and then depending upon the i, hide the fragment
[13:04:43] <taplar> technically as you may be doing alot of appends in this as it is, fragments would be a good thing anyway
[13:04:52] <taplar> create your results and append them all at the end
[13:05:56] <iCHAIT> taplar: I think functionality wise it is essentialy same as hiding only the selects via their id's, however the code will definitely get cleaner :)
[13:06:37] <taplar> true.  the point though with making fragments and appending them at the end though is your limit your interactions with the dom
[13:06:47] <taplar> thus limiting the number of times the browser has do redraw
[13:06:53] <taplar> and all the other things it does
[13:07:47] <iCHAIT> taplar: Oh I see, that means my current setup has too much overhead
[13:08:00] <taplar> no, not -bad-.  just could be better
[13:08:02] <taplar> :)
[13:08:13] <iCHAIT> taplar: Sure, trying it.
[13:08:53] <taplar> hope you get it iCHAIT.  i'm actually out for the evening.  catch you all tomorrow
[13:09:36] <iCHAIT> taplar: Yeah, thanks :D
[13:16:18] <gambl0re> so the bare minimum you need to make an ajax request is the url and .done()? everything else is optional?
[13:17:18] <Crucials> you dont really need .done either
[13:21:05] <cjohnson> You can use $.get('/foo.json').done(...)  also gambl0re
[13:21:08] <cjohnson> to type even less
[13:23:08] <squeakita> http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/2pza5/ How can I pass and use a 2nd value for country, like I want to use an abbreviation as the option value. How can I do that?
[13:23:32] <gambl0re> oh ok..
[13:23:53] <cjohnson> squeakita: use a different variable for the value="' + lcn + '" bit...
[13:24:30] <squeakita> how do i add that 2nd var in the country array?
[13:25:09] <squeakita> sorry, locations array
[13:25:19] <cjohnson> You would have to restructure it
[13:25:55] <squeakita> can you give me an example of what that would look like
[13:25:59] <cjohnson> var locations = [ {name: 'Germany', value: 'DE', cities: ['Duesseldor', 'Leinfelden-Echterdingen']} , ... ];
[13:26:23] <cjohnson> you'll probably have to slightly change lines 14-16 too
[13:27:08] <squeakita> cjohnson thanks - lets see how far i can get with that
[13:30:04] <quuxman> How do I filter out elements from a jquery object that match a selector?
[13:30:20] <quuxman> sort of the opposite of $foo.filter('.bar')
[13:30:28] <thinkeyP> Hey! How do i change the text of currentkpindex: <div data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right"> <h1 id="currentkpindex">Change this text</h1> from javascript?
[13:30:47] <quuxman> $('#currentkpindex').text('foo')
[13:31:07] <cjohnson> quuxman: have you tried .not?
[13:31:17] <quuxman> You can also put markup in there with: $('#currentkpindex').html('foo<b>bold</b>bar')
[13:31:22] <thinkeyP> did not work
[13:31:22] <quuxman> cjohnson: thanks
[13:31:41] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why $(window).outerWidth() is returning a smaller value than the actual browser viewport width?
[13:31:44] <thinkeyP> it removes the button but displays the text
[13:32:09] <cjohnson> thinkeyP: paste your actual HTML markup. using a pastebin
[13:32:10] <thinkeyP> i want to change the text in a <div data-role="collapsible">, which is a h1
[13:32:42] <quuxman> thinkeyP: you mean you want to change the text in the <h1> tag?
[13:32:58] <quuxman> the .text() method naturally only applies to text, not elements
[13:34:08] <Pizentios> piXonix robertmaxrees: i have it figured, had a syntax error in the file that for some reason wasn't causing an error directly, but was nuking my code...frustraiting as hell lol
[13:34:58] <Pizentios> thanks for your help thoguh guys
[13:36:36] <piXonix> Pizentios: ouch, I hate that!
[13:37:25] <Pizentios> no kidding
[13:37:38] <Pizentios> was about to put my fist through one of my monitors
[13:37:39] <Pizentios> lol
[13:38:08] <thinkeyP>  $('#currentkpindex').text('foo'); do not work if it is inside a function
[13:38:11] <Pizentios> i'd rather have errors that crash it, then show nothing
[13:38:13] <thinkeyP> can that be correct+
[13:39:31] <thinkeyP> hm
[13:40:16] <thinkeyP> inside like this: function myFunction(inputText) { $('#currentkpindex').text('foo'); } changes the text but removes the button
[13:40:24] <thinkeyP> outside, it works perfectly
[13:43:27] <thinkeyP> any ideas?
[13:43:38] <Trisox> whats the question
[13:45:26] <Trisox> thinkeyP: it should do the text change when executing the function
[13:46:05] <Cork> thinkeyP: .text() doesn
[13:46:17] <Cork> doesn't just replace text in an element
[13:46:23] <Cork> it also replaces all child elements
[13:46:35] <Cork> so if the button is in the same element, then ya it will also be removed
[13:47:18] <thinkeyP> hm
[13:47:40] <thinkeyP> i'll get you a pastebim
[13:47:42] <thinkeyP> bin*
[13:50:14] <theskillwithin> I start a  new job next week, any books / video I can watch to touch up my jQuery chops?
[13:50:19] <thinkeyP> http://pastebin.com/jNNLNXUm
[13:50:20] <Trisox> yep you have to select the wrapper like Cork said
[13:50:21] <thinkeyP> at the bottom
[13:50:30] <thinkeyP> that do not work
[13:50:56] <thinkeyP> but if I move $('#currentkpindex').text('KP' + matches[0][2]); outside its function and rmeoves matches[0][2] it do work
[13:51:12] <thinkeyP> does*
[13:51:50] <Trisox> try moving you function above onreadystatechange
[13:52:25] <Trisox> what you want only works if you do thi
[13:52:26] <Trisox> this
[13:52:36] <Trisox> var myFunction =  function ()
[13:52:39] <Cork> thinkeyP: don't put scripts after </body>
[13:52:41] <Trisox> since var's get scoped
[13:52:48] <Trisox> also that
[13:52:58] <Trisox> var thets hoisted i mean
[13:53:07] <thinkeyP> okey
[13:53:26] <Cork> and no the definition of the function shouldn't matter
[13:53:38] <Trisox> well it can ;)
[13:54:02] <Cork> no, not as long as the js parser follows the spec
[13:54:22] <thinkeyP> hm, that did not help unfortunately
[13:54:32] <Cork> no, that is just a correctness change
[13:54:36] <thinkeyP> okey
[13:54:43] <Cork> the browser will do that in it's error correction anyway
[13:55:14] <Cork> thinkeyP: what's the button that get's removed?
[13:55:42] <Trisox> try http://pastebin.com/w9Vxm6Tf
[13:56:24] <thinkeyP> hm that did not work either :/
[13:56:38] <thinkeyP> this one disappears:  <div data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right">
[13:56:42] <Trisox> or http://pastebin.com/qTXx9jFL
[13:56:43] <thinkeyP> the design...
[13:57:00] <thinkeyP> just the new text shows up but the button disappears
[13:57:09] <Cork> thinkeyP: also you're html isn't valid
[13:57:16] <Cork> you aren't closing one of the divs
[13:57:54] <Trisox> oh haha cork
[13:58:28] <thinkeyP> hm
[13:58:57] <Trisox> thinkeyP: what editor you using?
[13:59:26] <thinkeyP> notepad++
[13:59:35] <thinkeyP> is there any autoindent-function?
[14:00:21] <Trisox> use like webstorm or something or sublime
[14:00:26] <thinkeyP> okey
[14:00:27] <Trisox> sublime text
[14:00:43] <Cork> thinkeyP: what would be in the inputText when it is triggered?
[14:00:56] <Cork> (i need it to try to reproduce the problem)
[14:00:56] <Trisox> better help with thouse validation problems http://www.sublimetext.com/
[14:00:59] <theskillwithin> I start a  new job next week, any books / video I can watch/read to touch up my jQuery chops?
[14:01:11] <Trisox> codeschool
[14:01:11] <theskillwithin> http://www.sublimetext.com/3
[14:01:28] <Trisox> theskillwithin: codeschool ;)
[14:01:32] <Cork> thinkeyP: http://jsfiddle.net/mfckgo08/
[14:01:35] <thinkeyP> thanks... this will be in input text: http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/text/3-day-forecast.txt
[14:01:35] <Trisox> they have a free one
[14:01:38] <thinkeyP> inputText
[14:03:33] <thinkeyP> hm
[14:03:38] <Cork> thinkeyP: if you could add what is needed to the function call at the end of that fiddle it would be nice
[14:03:48] <thinkeyP> tried to
[14:03:58] <thinkeyP> I guess this aint working? http://jsfiddle.net/mfckgo08/1/
[14:04:20] <Cork> oh it expectes the entire string...
[14:04:24] <Cork> jikes
[14:04:28] <thinkeyP> :/
[14:04:43] <thinkeyP> yes unfortunately :/
[14:04:58] <Trisox> oeps   '' + '' + ''
[14:05:01] <Trisox> HAHA
[14:05:26] <Trisox> thinkeyP: you got controll over this  3-day-forecast.txt thing
[14:05:39] <Trisox> if you do convert it to json
[14:05:42] <theskillwithin> no books?
[14:05:42] <thinkeyP> nope, sorry
[14:05:51] <thinkeyP> yes i know. that would be so much easier!
[14:06:03] <thinkeyP> but they only provide their data in these .txt files which sucks
[14:06:23] <thinkeyP> and i've tried to email them without getting any answer
[14:06:48] <thinkeyP> but
[14:06:55] <thinkeyP> does the inputtext really matteR?
[14:07:19] <Cork> thinkeyP: http://jsfiddle.net/mfckgo08/2/
[14:07:53] <thinkeyP> hm
[14:07:59] <thinkeyP> but the button is removed, or?
[14:08:05] <thinkeyP> and only text is showing up
[14:08:16] <thinkeyP> collapsible*
[14:10:05] <Cork> thinkeyP: you mean that <div data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right"> that is wrapping the h1 tag?
[14:10:29] <thinkeyP> yes
[14:10:46] <thinkeyP> that one disappears when changing the h1 text from javascript
[14:10:53] <Trisox> thinkeyP: you could get the txt file like this $.get("http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/text/3-day-forecast.txt", function (response) { console.log(response); });
[14:11:07] <Trisox> this way you got it in a var already
[14:11:35] <Cork> thinkeyP: the element is still there
[14:12:27] <Trisox> any way shady code and resources at the least :)
[14:12:42] <Trisox> one is result of the other for sure
[14:13:24] <thinkeyP> hm
[14:14:03] <Cork> thinkeyP: ah, did you enable jquery mobile?
[14:14:26] <MrDigital> can i ask a json question here?
[14:14:32] <thinkeyP> yes
[14:14:39] <Cork> cause ya, jqm does lots of weirdness and might be what is breaking things for you
[14:14:54] <thinkeyP> but it does not get removed for you?
[14:14:55] <Trisox> sure MrDigital
[14:14:57] <thinkeyP> when running the code
[14:15:02] <Cork> MrDigital: sure, why not; though just ask don't ask to ask
[14:15:11] <MrDigital> https://www.aftership.com/docs/api/4
[14:15:14] <Cork> thinkeyP: nope the element is still there
[14:15:21] <Cork> with a ton of classes though
[14:15:26] <MrDigital> i don't understand the url format to get info for a tracking #
[14:15:37] <Cork> <div class="ui-collapsible ui-collapsible-inset ui-corner-all ui-collapsible-themed-content ui-collapsible-collapsed" data-role="collapsible" data-iconpos="right">
[14:15:44] <MrDigital> i have a json rest tester
[14:16:07] <thinkeyP> huh
[14:16:35] <thinkeyP> nowai
[14:17:00] <MrDigital> is it /trackings/?tracking_number= ?
[14:17:36] <Cork> MrDigital: as far as i can tell it isn't documented there
[14:17:40] <MrDigital> sure it is
[14:17:54] <thinkeyP> using this?  http://jsfiddle.net/mfckgo08/2/
[14:17:59] <MrDigital> https://www.aftership.com/docs/api/4/trackings/get-trackings-slug-tracking_number
[14:18:25] <Cork> ah
[14:18:32] <MrDigital> Notice that you can always use/:id to replace /:slug/:tracking_number
[14:18:41] <MrDigital> i don't understnad the :id part
[14:18:58] <Trisox> its prob from wordpress
[14:18:59] <thinkeyP> check this out: http://imgur.com/ZYmaMd4
[14:19:17] <Cork> MrDigital: so /trackings/<id>
[14:19:25] <MrDigital> <id> = ???
[14:19:27] <MrDigital> tracking?
[14:19:30] <thinkeyP> does it look the same way for you?
[14:19:31] <Trisox> anything ..
[14:19:33] <Cork> the id you want to request
[14:19:37] <Trisox> id = identifier
[14:19:50] <MrDigital> see i am looking at a php example
[14:19:54] <Cork> MrDigital: meaning the tracking number
[14:20:01] <Trisox> slug is like cattegory
[14:20:02] <MrDigital> return $this->send('trackings/' . $slug . '/' . $tracking_number, 'PUT', json_encode(array('tracking' => $options)));
[14:20:13] <MrDigital> so that means /trackings/324017498179239847
[14:20:15] <MrDigital> right?
[14:20:19] <Cork> MrDigital: its a get request not a put
[14:20:22] <Trisox> yep for example
[14:20:27] <MrDigital> i know it is
[14:20:29] <Cork> also... this is getting really of topic
[14:20:30] <Trisox> get ;-)
[14:20:31] <MrDigital> i took that from the example
[14:20:35] <Cork> = ##php
[14:20:57] <MrDigital> but when i use my tester and i do /trackings/tracking#here it says invaild id
[14:21:03] <MrDigital> is their api broken?
[14:21:22] <Cork> thinkeyP: check the dom structure not the rendering
[14:21:40] <Trisox> https://api.aftership.com/v4/tracking/3443 <--
[14:22:02] <Trisox> very normal rest api if you ask me ;)
[14:22:09] <Trisox> even good feedback
[14:22:14] <MrDigital> i have creds
[14:22:31] <MrDigital> which are supplied on the request
[14:22:34] <Trisox> any way like Cork said not realy a jquery topic
[14:22:40] <MrDigital> i know
[14:22:47] <MrDigital> but i plan on use jquery :)
[14:22:49] <thinkeyP> aah true!
[14:22:52] <Trisox> or a json topic
[14:22:54] <MrDigital> with the response
[14:22:54] <thinkeyP> the collapsible is t
[14:22:58] <thinkeyP> still there*
[14:23:09] <thinkeyP> but the css design of the collapsible disappearS?
[14:23:38] <Cork> MrDigital: my suggestion is that you look up restful urls
[14:24:04] <Cork> ah Trisox already said this :)
[14:24:23] <Cork> thinkeyP: ya, that is jqm for you
[14:24:37] <Cork> check what it does to the dom structure when it runs
[14:24:44] <thinkeyP> how do i check the dom?
[14:24:48] <Cork> you most likely is removing something with the .text() call
[14:24:56] <Cork> right click the page and inspect
[14:24:58] <thinkeyP> using chrome debudding?
[14:25:00] <thinkeyP> ok
[14:26:08] <thinkeyP> hm under elements?
[14:27:58] <Cork> thinkeyP: if you right click the element and selects inspect, you should end up in the correct place in the developer tools
[14:28:18] <thinkeyP> yep
[14:28:30] <thinkeyP> it adds a class to the h1?
[14:29:22] <thinkeyP> class="ui-collapsible-heading ui-collapsible-heading-collapsed"
[14:35:58] <Jabberwock> Has anyone here used Typeahead.js and been caught off guard by the fact that it modifies the width of the input field?
[14:39:50] <EricBB> if I have a jquery script retrieving a string through ajax from php that gets it from a database, and when jquery adds it to the page live it displays \r\n all over the place, but when php outputs it serverside it does not, what is going on?
[14:40:44] <Trisox> EricBB: thouse are end of line char;s
[14:40:57] <Jabberwock> Sanitize all output for a whitelist of acceptable characters.
[14:41:01] <Trisox> \n is used in creating new lines
[14:41:58] <Trisox> that Jabberwock said
[14:42:08] <EricBB> well why wouldnt .replace("\r\n",''); be fixing it?
[14:42:17] <Jabberwock> Replace it with PHP.
[14:42:25] <Jabberwock> Imagine if the database returned <img src=x onerror=alert('pwned')
[14:42:43] <Jabberwock> and if onerror was actually href=http://evil.tgt/beef/hook.js
[14:42:57] <Cork> EricBB: how are you adding the output to the page?
[14:43:15] <EricBB> using append
[14:43:41] <Cork> EricBB: and you get \r\n visibly in the page?
[14:43:48] <EricBB> cork: yes
[14:43:55] <Cork> replace(
[14:43:57] <Cork> opps
[14:44:04] <Jabberwock> then something is encoding it
[14:44:18] <Cork> replace('\\r\\n', '') then
[14:44:19] <Jabberwock> Does the database have \\r\\n ?
[14:44:31] <EricBB> jabberwock no
[14:44:39] <EricBB> cork ah let me try, that makes sense
[14:45:07] <Cork> but ya, you should check the http response from the server
[14:45:24] <Cork> and if the \r\n is in there you should fix the server code
[14:45:26] <Jabberwock> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_PHP_Filters
[14:54:13] <mdev> #jquery woooo!
[15:02:53] <EricBB> trisox, jabberwock, cork thanks for being awesome, later guys
[15:03:08] <Trisox> have a nice one
[15:03:51] <Jabberwock> bye :)
[16:02:09] <theskillwithin> any good short videos explaining jquery ajax?
[16:21:02] <peterson_> bah - it only took me 8 bloody hours to solve one stupid little problem :/
[17:10:18] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[17:12:14] <robertmaxrees> si
[17:15:46] <mdev> this is america
[17:15:52] <mdev> we speak american in here
[17:17:45] <hellyeah> mdev:  hey sup
[17:17:51] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:18:32] <hellyeah> i want to refresh the page without chaging the appearence of page https://css-tricks.com/examples/DynamicPage/#contact.php like that click Contact and refresh the page you see you are still in contact
[17:18:34] <mdev> lol i'm just joking
[17:18:37] <mdev> and hi :)
[17:18:50] <hellyeah> is it possible to do that with http://www.javascriptmvc.com/
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery for that.
[17:20:15] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax()
[17:21:19] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  like partial refresh?
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> you use ajax.
[17:21:34] <robertmaxrees> when you're done submitting, you change part of the page.
[17:44:52] <SimbaLion`> Hi I'm trying to build a dynamic form that will calculate fields, I've got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/5/ most of the code is borrowed, and works, except I'm not sure how to display the calculated value. You can see the function at the bottom of the jquery is all derpy. Can someone help?
[17:56:01] <mdev> SimbaLIon jquery is a DOM manipulator
[17:56:15] <mdev> meaning you can .append or modify the .html of an element and tons of other things
[17:56:32] <mdev> so give your div, or whatever an id, or class then use jquery to mess with it, example
[17:56:59] <mdev> <div id="whatever"></div> then for jquery can $("#whatever").html('new value');
[17:57:09] <mdev> or .append('new stuff');
[17:58:28] <SimbaLion`> I figured that much out, and I think I got the hang of using append.. but now I'm running into a variable issue http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/6/ it says total_price is undefined in console, but if I define it as 0 at the begining, it never changes
[17:58:52] <Mottie> you need to bind to the input change
[18:00:49] <mdev> define it outside of $(function() {
[18:00:51] <mdev> so that it's globally accesible
[18:01:11] <mdev> do var price; then inside functions just do price = or price++ or whatever
[18:04:02] <SimbaLion`> okay that fixes the error, but now it says NaN instead of 0, even tho the .price input has a default value of 0
[18:04:40] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/7/ to see
[18:05:37] <SimbaLion`> Mottie, I'm sorry I dont know what that means, can you show me an example? None of the samples I looked at used .bind at all
[18:06:56] <Mottie> SimbaLion: one sec, updating your demo
[18:07:05] <SimbaLion`> thanks
[18:07:48] <Mottie> ok SimbaLion, this demo uses jQuery 1.11.0 so some things have changed: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/xvchqphd/8/
[18:08:18] <Mottie> SimbaLion I also removed all the IDs since they weren't unique
[18:10:44] <SimbaLion`> ah I'm not looking for a way to calculate quantity * price, I just need to sum up a number of items, but the number of items is dynamic.
[18:11:36] <Mottie> SimbaLion same idea
[18:18:54] <pyCasso> in js or jquery is there a way to say if ( foo in bar ){ ..this..} ?
[18:31:17] <SimbaLion`> Okay here's what I've got http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/10/ but I'm getting an undefined variable error, I think my syntax is off somewhere..
[18:32:44] <SimbaLion`> the 'remove' function is broken
[18:32:45] <Mottie> SimbaLion: I renamed "lineItems" to "$lineItems" to indicate that it is a jQuery object - more of a personal preference thing
[18:34:05] <Mottie> SimbaLion: again, id's should be unique... you should change that to a class, and use a deferred event binding
[18:34:41] <SimbaLion`> Ah ok.. the id's are messed up from when I adapted borrowed code
[18:34:46] <SimbaLion`> thank you for your help
[18:35:22] <Mottie> SimbaLion, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/xvchqphd/12/
[18:38:19] <SimbaLion`> hrm, it mostly works, but does not update when a line is removed, however if a line is removed and then an item is changed, it updates
[18:40:21] <Mottie> SimbaLion: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/xvchqphd/14/
[18:41:54] <SimbaLion`> Awesome, thanks so much! :)
[18:42:00] <Mottie> np
[18:42:19] <mdev> you the man Mottie
[18:42:24] <Mottie> :P
[18:43:03] <Mottie> I'm just trying to figure out where these errors in jQuery UI + jQuery v3.0.0 are coming from =/
[18:43:26] <mdev> debugging can be tricky
[18:43:37] <mdev> i've spent countless hours debugging things over the yeras
[18:44:33] <mdev> I derp hard sometimes, recently I spent hours frustrated because what was happening was I was making changes to the wrong file, because has copies of the files in a few different folders
[18:44:37] <mdev> took forever to realize that
[18:44:40] <mdev> lol
[18:44:56] <Mottie> lol been there, done that
[18:45:00] <Mottie> got a crappy t-shirt
[18:45:06] <mdev> lol
[18:47:56] <Mottie> Now, I need a t-shirt that says "I <3 ‚ò∞"
[19:00:26] <brazil_cwb> hi
[19:45:58] <messianic> askjn
[21:33:12] <SimbaLion`> Hi, I'm nearly finished with this quote generator, http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/20/ how can I make it deal in dollars and cents rather than whole numbers only? Currently it is rounding the deposit and remainders.
[21:35:35] <SimbaLion`> nvm found the answer, got to use parseFloat() instead of parseInt()
[22:42:26] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/26/ I want this to add a new input line when I tab out of the second input field in each, and I want focus to jump to the next "Item Name" field, but it doesn't seem to be working as I expected, any help is appreciated :)
[22:51:19] <SimbaLion`> also, .keydown() doesn't seem to work on the created rows, only the initial row.. hrm, maybe they're related
[23:18:28] <Cork> SimbaLion`: something like http://jsfiddle.net/xvchqphd/29/ ?
[23:23:09] <d3m0n> Hey guys, does this look correct http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VLdddb ?
[23:23:33] <d3m0n> For some reason it's not adding console logging has class when a page in the array has that body class
[23:25:19] <d3m0n> Updated : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VLdddb
[23:27:22] <d3m0n> AH!
[23:27:38] <d3m0n> It's because I was adding "." I forgot anything with class function you dont need to add the '.'
[23:32:44] <Cork> d3m0n: if($('body').is('.' + pageArray.join(',.'))) {}
[23:32:49] <Cork> no need for the each loop
[23:33:32] <d3m0n> Cork: jQuery knows to run an each on that array?
[23:33:46] <d3m0n> Since I know PHP would reject that and say it's an array.
[23:33:49] <Cork> no, it isn't an array when jquery gets it
[23:33:58] <Cork> .join(',.') <--
[23:34:06] <d3m0n> Ahhhhhh
[23:34:12] <d3m0n> I see what you did, made it into a string
[23:34:22] <Cork> made it into a selector
[23:34:24] <Cork> not just a string
[23:34:28] <d3m0n> Yea
[23:34:31] <d3m0n> String of selectors
[23:34:46] <d3m0n> Thanks!
[23:36:35] <becom33> Im trying to add a uitableviewcontroller into a view . but it view seems like showing the middle of the uitableview controller
[23:43:33] <hellyeah> hey there
[23:43:47] <hellyeah> can anyone help me to figure it out why i can console.log("da") in else statement. Normally checkbox is checked by default but when i uncheck it i want to reach else statement http://jsfiddle.net/rodtd7wz/
[23:45:25] <slax0r> instead of pasting in your whole script, maybe just re-create the relative script/html that you are having trouble with?
[23:51:26] <SimbaLion`> do jquery selectors only apply to the first element found? I'm trying to use $(.athing) and it seems like it's only matching the first element with class="athing"
[23:51:56] <SimbaLion`> what I want it to do is apply the same behavior to every element with that class
[23:52:32] <jak2000> hi all friends, any plugin for take photow with my webcam?
[23:58:05] <Cork> jak2000: not sure if there is a plugin for it
[23:58:17] <Cork> but there are plenty of code snippets for how you do that
[23:58:29] <jak2000> Cork thanks
[23:58:53] <Cork> SimbaLion`: no, $() finds all elements with the class
[23:59:05] <Cork> SimbaLion`: some functions only work on the first element though
[23:59:19] <Cork> SimbaLion`: so, show the code
