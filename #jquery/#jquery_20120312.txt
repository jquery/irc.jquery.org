[00:15:47] <SuperRoach|> heres a jsfiddle question - what's the shortest piece of code you can have for "click here to run a function" .   this one is having problems: http://jsfiddle.net/WS5WH/1/
[00:16:14] <SuperRoach|> In that one, I was trying to use onClick  in the a tag.
[00:16:15] <mindis|wurk> hola. anyone got any ideas how to automate sprite cutting from an icon set? i have something like 80 icons and i wouldn't want to manually create an id and css for each icon
[00:17:22] <SuperRoach|> spriteright mindis|wurk ?
[00:18:06] <mindis|wurk> no i already have my sprites in a set, i just need some way to get the css without writing an id entry for each icon manually
[00:18:28] <mindis|wurk> i could generate a css bit with php but that doesn't sound very nice
[00:18:54] <SuperRoach|> try spriteme ?
[00:20:11] <mindis|wurk> i already thought i had solved the problem by using inline background-position or clip:rect but due to someones genius neither are actually supported
[00:25:46] <atxq> I am trying to return the name of all the html tags inside a div.
[00:26:15] <atxq> any ideas how I can do this?
[00:26:47] <mindis|wurk> someelement.get(0).tagName
[00:27:12] <Cork> $.map($div, function() { return this.tagName; });
[00:27:15] <Cork> opps
[00:27:24] <Cork> $.map($div.find('*'), function() { return this.tagName; });
[00:28:45] <mindis|wurk> is there a specific benefit of using map instead of each here?
[00:34:28] <gst123> document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML= hyperlink; it's possible in jquery
[00:34:53] <Cork> $('#demo').html(heperlink)
[00:35:04] <Cork> *hyperlink
[00:35:08] <gst123> i want to load external html page into inside of main html page....its possible in jquery
[00:35:37] <gst123> any 1 clarify my doubt........
[00:35:49] <Cork> uh.. i've already answered you
[00:36:07] <gst123> wt u answered yaar
[00:36:47] <gst123> k ill try and get back to u @cork................
[00:36:57] <gst123> thank for reply me
[00:38:13] <fr0ggie> How would i do something like <a onclick="singlet();" id="auth.login"> so that singlet() will make sure only one instance of a window (by URL) exists, showing it if requested
[00:38:54] <Cork> fr0ggie: you need to explain that a bit more
[00:39:39] <fr0ggie> Cork: I need to access the id for the link from singlet()
[00:39:51] <fr0ggie> So i can construct a URL from it (to use as a window-ID)
[00:40:08] <Cork> and the event handler needs to be inline?
[00:40:09] <fr0ggie> if the window exists, raise it, else create it. But allow precisely one window for that URL
[00:40:37] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, I'm very new to Javascript/jQuery and am trying to echo the text value of a selection in a drop-down. Here's my page: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing on the 3rd drop-down (#attribute129) I want to echo out whatever's selected above the table just in plain text for use later on. Here's my code: http://pastie.org/3575901 What am I doing wrong :x
[00:41:08] <fr0ggie> Cork: well-- singlet() ideally for id="auth.login" would create a url like /auth.login/ and either create or a show a window for with that request in it
[00:41:49] <Cork> fr0ggie: i mean what prevents you form ex adding a class="something" and then have a global event listner instead?
[00:42:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: could you reduce the code to just the part your asking about; preferable making it a live demo
[00:42:31] <Cork> ?demo
[00:42:47] <Cork> oh... lovely, the bot is down
[00:43:03] <fr0ggie> Cork: lack of jq knowledge? ;)
[00:43:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: use jsfiddle.net
[00:43:22] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I can't I'm working in Magento :x
[00:43:25] <fRAiLtY-> for my sins
[00:43:32] <fRAiLtY-> I've supplied a demo site and a very tiny piece of code :x
[00:43:34] <fr0ggie> there's lots and lots of modules, however and some are created on-demand (virtual)
[00:43:36] <Cork> fr0ggie: ok, then my recomendation is: add a class that identify the links you care about
[00:43:44] <Zogot> fRAiLtY-: bring the :selected next to the text and use .val() and ur missing the closing )
[00:44:09] <Cork> fr0ggie: then use $(document).on('click', '.your-class', function(event) { this.id == your elements id });
[00:44:13] <fr0ggie> Cork: hmm.. i dont know how i'd make jquery able to get that information
[00:44:53] <atxq> $.map returned a bunch of undefineds
[00:45:26] <fr0ggie> Also-- is it 'bad form' to use a form element (a checkbox) that's not actually part of a form?
[00:45:53] <fr0ggie> i want to use it to toggle autohiding my dock (shows running apps)
[00:46:18] <fr0ggie> am i wiser to just use an image?
[00:47:08] <Cork> atxq: http://jsfiddle.net/ysWyL/
[00:47:22] <Cork> atxq: forgot that map doesn't set this
[00:47:29] <fRAiLtY-> Zogot: Think I'm misunderstanding, just looked up val on jquery API and have come up with this, still wrong though I'm guessing? http://pastie.org/3575901
[00:47:40] <fr0ggie> Cork: im making a simple web-desktop for interacting with my project
[00:47:46] <Cork> fr0ggie: no its not bad practis
[00:48:18] <Cork> i would argu that its a bad practis to use it for design, but not if you actually want a checkbox :)
[00:48:35] <Cork> (yes there ar ppl that use unchecked checkboxes for design)
[00:49:25] <atxq> so any other suggests on how I can return all the tag names within a div?
[00:49:39] <Cork> atxq: see the pb, it works
[00:50:06] <Es0teric> how do i make javascript work in a jqueryui dialog box?
[00:50:21] <atxq> pb?
[00:50:26] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ysWyL/
[00:50:50] <Cork> Es0teric: you can't really make anything work inside a jquery ui dialog, its just dom elements
[00:51:09] <Cork> Es0teric: but when you append script tags to the document it should be parsed
[00:51:15] <amirite> how do i blur a select w/ jquery
[00:51:35] <Cork> $('select').blur()
[00:51:39] <atxq> thanks again Cork
[00:51:42] <Es0teric> Cork script tags inside the document html?
[00:51:48] <amirite> nope doesn't work cork
[00:51:56] <Cork> Es0teric: document?
[00:52:11] <Es0teric> Cork, right now i am using .dialog() with .load()
[00:52:11] <Cork> no jquery ui dialogs take html fragements not full webpages
[00:52:22] <amirite> anyone know how to blur a select?
[00:52:29] <Es0teric> so its $('#div').dialog().load('path/to/container #container')
[00:52:37] <Cork> amirite: read the response
[00:52:44] <amirite> cork read my response
[00:52:50] <amirite> anyone know how to blur a select?
[00:53:13] <Cork> amirite: that will trigger the blur event on the select element yes
[00:53:15] <amirite> i can use .find('option').each(function(){ this.selected=false; }) but i don't know if that's cross browser
[00:53:22] <amirite> i don't want the blur event
[00:53:24] <amirite> i want it to blur
[00:53:31] <amirite> to lose focus
[00:53:33] <amirite> to not be selected
[00:53:40] <Cork> then you need to put focus on something else
[00:53:50] <Cork> like $('body').focus()
[00:54:20] <amirite> nope doesn't work
[00:54:33] <amirite> you're just making yourself out to be knowledgable but you don't know shit
[00:54:36] <Es0teric> so, Cork i am trying to get tooltips to work inside the dialogbox
[00:54:36] <Cork> Es0teric: if you have script tags inside #container it should be parsed and added to the current javascript pool
[00:54:44] <Cork> amirite: ok
[00:54:44] <Es0teric> i see...
[00:54:47] <Es0teric> intresting
[00:55:17] <fubhy> amirite it is .blur()
[00:56:29] <fubhy> amirite ah you want to unfocus it
[00:56:37] <fubhy> well you can only do that by giving the focus to something else
[00:56:37] <amirite> yes
[00:57:09] <Es0teric> Cork, adding the script tag inside the container didnt parse the tooltips
[00:57:10] <amirite> this is a multiple select
[00:57:17] <amirite> i want to unselect all options
[00:57:30] <Cork> Es0teric: how are you referencing the tooltips?
[00:57:59] <Es0teric> Cork via twitter bootstrap
[00:58:01] <Es0teric> but i have the file loaded
[00:58:27] <fubhy> amirite you want to unselect all options? well thats something completely different then
[00:58:28] <Cork> Es0teric: i meant how are you finding the elements you want the tooltips on?
[00:58:33] <fubhy> that has nothing to do with "blur"
[00:58:56] <Es0teric> Cork id's
[00:59:00] <Es0teric> well classes
[00:59:20] <Es0teric> Cork -> $('.message_container li a').tooltip({animation: true});
[00:59:26] <Cork> hmm
[00:59:32] <Cork> that should work
[00:59:57] <fubhy> amirite try this: $("option:selected").removeAttr("selected");
[01:00:03] <Xotix> If you have an ul within an contenteditable div, you can extend this list easily by pressing enter to create a new li. What's the best way for checking if a li was added?
[01:00:10] <Es0teric> and its IN the div that i am referencing on the .load()
[01:00:26] <Cork> Es0teric: that doens't matter
[01:00:50] <Cork> only thing that matters is that the html parser finds the script and hands it over to the js engin
[01:01:33] <Es0teric> i see, Cork.. well its not working i mean i tried using twitter bootstrap modal
[01:01:39] <Es0teric> but it was a fuckin pain to get to work
[01:03:44] <Cork> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/dP2fX/ yup it works
[01:04:13] <Cork> run some debugging in the script tag and make sure the script finds the html your looking for
[01:04:15] <Es0teric> Cork use jquery ui .dialog()
[01:04:20] <Cork> doens't matter
[01:04:49] <Cork> that just moves the elements around and adds some wrapper around it + classes
[01:05:44] <Es0teric> intresting… i am on the original page the container is in and the js isnt even active...
[01:09:04] <Es0teric> Cork, it works on the full page… but when i do the modal, it doesnt show the tips
[01:10:12] <fRAiLtY-> I'm getting an uncaught exception, token ILLEGAL error in this code, why: http://jsfiddle.net/4rxEE/
[01:11:49] <Xotix> is there a difference between $(input).focus().click() and $(input).click()?
[01:12:20] <Cork> Xotix: shouldn't be both should return the jquery object
[01:12:47] <Cork> browsers sometimes handle it differently if an element you click on doens't have focus though
[01:13:44] <Es0teric> Xotix, it should be… $(input).on('click', function() { $(this).focus();  }); //etc
[01:14:01] <Cork> Es0teric: .click() triggers the click event, its not a listner
[01:14:11] <Es0teric> oooh
[01:14:11] <Es0teric> ok
[01:14:23] <Es0teric> hmm
[01:14:28] <Es0teric> i still dont know whats going on with this
[01:14:33] <Xotix> hmm ok thanks
[01:14:54] <Zogot> fRAiLtY-: change find('selected') to .find(':selected')
[01:14:55] <Zogot> sorry :p
[01:16:01] <fRAiLtY-> Zogot: Same error mate Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL it's pointing towards the end of the script where the close tags are which is odd?
[01:17:35] <Cork> fr0ggie: $(this).val() should give you the currently selected value in the dropdown
[01:17:49] <Cork> no need to hunt down the option
[01:18:23] <fr0ggie> dropdown?
[01:19:03] <Cork> fr0ggie: sorry wrong nick
[01:19:08] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that was for you
[01:19:39] <eddiemonge> Xotix: the difference is one first focus it then triggers click on it while the other just triggers click. if you are just trying to focus an element, then do .focus()
[01:20:05] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Still getting the same ILLEGAL token error :x
[01:20:28] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you have the html to go with that script?
[01:20:36] <Cork> or rather could you provide it :)
[01:20:55] <fRAiLtY-> Sure, it's rather lengthly as it's Magento and some of it is dynamically created, 2 secs
[01:21:10] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: just the select part is enough
[01:21:12] <Xotix> eddiemonge: i know I'm asking that because someone said n stackoverflow it should prefent ie from not subbmiting the form when doing a click on an input, what it usually does
[01:21:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the #attribute129 element
[01:21:25] <beasty> mornings all
[01:23:13] <aro> OHAI
[01:24:17] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I think my problem is that the drop-downs are created by javascript also, but I could be wrong? http://pastebin.com/y0RGRxD5
[01:24:32] <fRAiLtY-> As such I've included from the source what that bit is
[01:24:53] <eddiemonge> Xotix: no, that is see ? preventDefault
[01:25:16] <Xotix> eddiemonge: what? I was talkign about some security "feature" of ie
[01:26:06] <eddiemonge> Xotix: no. to prevent IE from submitting a form when clicking on a input type=submit, you use preventDefault. focus has nothing to do with it
[01:26:15] <soee> hi, how can i make some action to be triggered every time when some elements with class XYZ are added into code?
[01:26:21] <Xotix> eddiemonge: thats what ie does ITSELF
[01:26:23] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: whats your code?
[01:26:29] <eddiemonge> Xotix: what?
[01:26:39] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3575901
[01:26:44] <eddiemonge> soee: after you add XYZ, call your code
[01:26:46] <Xotix> If you auto click a file input, you are not able to submit  this form
[01:26:54] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: drop the find
[01:27:03] <fRAiLtY-> Have done, no change
[01:27:06] <fRAiLtY-> ILLEGAL token eror
[01:27:21] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: for one, you only need .val(), two, there is no element called selected so thats an invalid selector
[01:27:36] <eddiemonge> Xotix: autoclick a file input?
[01:28:04] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: new code http://pastie.org/3575901 same issue
[01:28:09] <Xotix> eddiemonge: http://tinyw.in/rXHw
[01:28:21] <fRAiLtY-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[01:28:30] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: because you cant use $
[01:29:34] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what in that object is meant to be the value of the option?
[01:29:58] <eddiemonge> Xotix: why would you auto-open it? its a security risk. but $("#yourElementID").click() should do it
[01:30:21] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: you called noConflict so you cant use $. You have to use jQuery()
[01:30:24] <Xotix> eddiemonge: thats not possible.. Because of nice user experience.
[01:32:35] <eddiemonge> a nice user experience doesnt auto -open a file input
[01:32:54] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3575901 still same error, Chrome Javascript Console points to the very end of the script, in the closing tags?
[01:33:04] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: The drop-down list is populated by javascript
[01:33:19] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I'm not sure hwo
[01:33:24] <fRAiLtY-> hence why Included the JS below
[01:33:28] <Xotix> eddiemonge: i got a handler for it. itt is a nice suer experience. im not opening anythign without an action of him.
[01:33:44] <eddiemonge> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/cNy6n/
[01:33:53] <eddiemonge> Xotix: you have to have an action for it to open
[01:34:12] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you could serialize the html generated on the page and use that
[01:34:28] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Really? How so?
[01:34:36] <fRAiLtY-> As I think that's my issue
[01:35:06] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: console.log($('<div/>').append($('#attribute129').clone()).html())
[01:35:26] <fRAiLtY-> Anywhere in the script?
[01:35:49] <Cork> in the browsers js console
[01:35:53] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: jshint.com
[01:36:04] <eddiemonge> no no no
[01:36:09] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: just lint your code
[01:36:18] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: I did, says it's valid
[01:36:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: TypeError: Cannot call method 'clone' of null
[01:36:34] <fRAiLtY-> interesting?
[01:36:35] <Xotix> eddiemonge:  If user does X I'm opening a form. In a context which makes sense. Instead of having that ugly form, i have nice handlers. e.g. to change an img, you click on the image. Thats why i needed to open that input. Which is not possible in IE.  I just had a little question, don't want to start a whole discussion about it but thanks.
[01:37:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: looks like something is replacing jquery for you
[01:37:22] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what does $.fn.jquery show? (on the console)
[01:37:36] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/Ga949/1/
[01:37:44] <fRAiLtY-> TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[01:37:59] <eddiemonge> Xotix: i just showed you how to do it
[01:38:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ok.. so $ isn't jquery
[01:38:12] <Cork> something is replacing it
[01:38:16] <fRAiLtY-> prototype?
[01:38:21] <fRAiLtY-> That's magento standard
[01:38:25] <Cork> if your loading it, then yes
[01:38:30] <fRAiLtY-> hence why I'm trying noConflict?
[01:38:38] <Xotix> eddiemonge: you CAN'T!! open a form like that in IE. :)
[01:38:47] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: JSLint Valid!
[01:38:47] <fRAiLtY-> Close window
[01:38:48] <fRAiLtY-> Your JS code is valid.
[01:39:10] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what variable are you using for jquery?
[01:39:19] <eddiemonge> Xotix: you CAN
[01:39:22] <Cork> (the return from noConflict
[01:39:23] <Xotix> IE will block the form from getting submited. :) On stackvoerflow, someone said, i could do $(input). focus().click(); that's why i asked, if there's some difference behind it.
[01:39:24] <Cork> )
[01:39:27] <Xotix> eddiemonge: try it
[01:39:39] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://pastie.org/3575901
[01:39:43] <fRAiLtY-> Looks like $ :x
[01:39:44] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[01:39:46] <Xotix> eddiemonge: with submiting it
[01:39:59] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ah, ok
[01:40:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then that means you need to use jQuery in every place your using $
[01:40:23] <fRAiLtY-> so jQuery.noConflict ?
[01:40:31] <Cork> its prob safer ya
[01:41:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but that code you pasted there throws too?
[01:41:13] <eddiemonge> Xotix: works for me in IE8
[01:41:18] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, changed it, still getting same 2 errors in console too and yes, the ILLEGAL error :x
[01:42:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what happens if you comment out that entire block?
[01:42:42] <Xotix> eddiemonge: you do a file input! click it via js, so it opens. then you submit it. this does not work due to security reasons. for sure in ie9
[01:42:43] <Cork> so you still get the iligal error?
[01:43:30] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: link to your site
[01:44:58] <eddiemonge> Xotix: did you read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1829774/jquery-simulating-a-click-on-a-input-type-file-doesnt-work-in-firefox ?
[01:45:45] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[01:45:52] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: comment out all the Jquery?
[01:46:03] <Xotix> eddiemonge: why? i've read lots of stuff about it, tried to do a few workarounds. clone the input etc
[01:46:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes, to check if its what causes the error, so its not from somwhere else in the code
[01:46:28] <fRAiLtY-> Yes commented out and error has gone
[01:46:43] <eddiemonge> Xotix: did you read the article about faking the file input?
[01:47:10] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: you need the noconflict because of prototype
[01:47:26] <Xotix> eddiemonge: which one? Im not interested in styling the input
[01:47:27] <fRAiLtY-> eddiemonge: I'm using noConflict, yes.
[01:47:37] <eddiemonge> fRAiLtY-: also, why are you using 1.6?
[01:47:53] <fRAiLtY-> It's already included, that's all. I'm just testing
[01:48:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: could you enable the jquery part again?
[01:49:26] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Error returns, ILLEGAL token. According to Chrome js tool, it's pointing at line 745 which is RIGHT at the end of the script, even after the last }); ?
[01:49:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: looks like you have a trailing none printable character there
[01:50:25] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Could this be because of a copy/paste somewhere? What's the best method of removal ?
[01:51:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: make sure your saving your files as utf8 and as plain text
[01:52:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and then remove every thing from the //}) to the end of the script tag
[01:52:12] <Cork> and type that out again
[01:52:18] <Cork> that should fix you up
[01:53:19] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Wahey, error gone! How weird!?
[01:53:58] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: not really, it was something that got in there from where ever you c&p it from
[01:54:27] <Cork> but ya, its always as confucing when that happens
[01:54:38] <fRAiLtY-> jsfiddle lol, never mind. In any case, my code still doesn't echo anything out, why do you think that is? latest code: http://pastie.org/3575901
[01:55:40] <optraz> i have a checkbox , now how do i check if the checkbox has the attribute checked ?
[01:56:24] <jmaister> I'm unable to retrive the selected index of my form select using $(<select element>).attr("selectedIndex"); Any idea why?
[01:56:25] <asher^> .is(":checked")
[01:57:30] <fRAiLtY-> cork: jsfiddle lol, never mind. In any case, my code still doesn't echo anything out, why do you think that is? latest code: http://pastie.org/3575901
[01:57:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i get value == "24" here
[01:58:02] <Cork> if i select 300gsm Gloss that is
[01:58:58] <fRAiLtY-> it echo's that somewhere?
[01:59:14] <Cork> no i put a breakpoint in the event handler
[01:59:29] <Cork> add console.log(value) after the var value = line
[01:59:38] <Cork> and you should see it in the console
[02:01:43] <fRAiLtY-> Lol, Cork console is blank for me: http://pastie.org/3575901
[02:04:46] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Are you using standard chrome console?
[02:04:54] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: gah.. something is overwriting console in your page...
[02:05:11] <fRAiLtY-> So how come you can see it and I can't ?
[02:05:23] <Cork> cause i didn't use console.log
[02:05:34] <optraz> asher^: i wanna do the if test to check if the checkbox is check, what's the correct construct?
[02:05:42] <Cork> all the console functions is overwritten with function() {} in the page
[02:05:48] <Cork> so you can't use them
[02:06:07] <fRAiLtY-> :(
[02:06:08] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ok... so... back to using alert i guess >_<
[02:06:18] <Cork> alert(value)
[02:06:39] * Cork morns the dying kittens
[02:06:56] <fRAiLtY-> lol Cork
[02:07:15] <fRAiLtY-> That works, I see 24 too, next question, why does it show 24 and not the actual text value, i.e. 300gsm Gloss ?
[02:07:21] <fRAiLtY-> is that an ID number it's showing?
[02:07:45] <Cork> cause it shows the value of the selected element
[02:07:54] <Cork> its whats sent to the server
[02:08:08] <fRAiLtY-> hmm, I need it to show the textual value ?
[02:08:16] <sjaak_trekhaak> I'm trying to have some sort of generic script to cancel all events for any anchor which has class disabled. Currently, I have something like $('.disabled').live('click',function(e) { e.stopImmediatePropagation() }.... however this doesn't always work, especially when its second in line to be handled.
[02:08:17] <fRAiLtY-> so I can pass that to PHP for my Mysql query
[02:08:38] <Sinner> Hi there
[02:08:39] <sjaak_trekhaak> Is there a proper way to cancel ALL events before a handler gets executed
[02:08:44] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text() should give you that
[02:09:02] <Sinner> Can someone pls. tell me where I''m doing it wrong: $('.level_1 li').hover(function() {console.log($(this).next('.level_2').height()); $(this).next('.level_2').css("top",0 - ($(this).next('.level_2').height+38))});
[02:09:22] <optraz> anyone?
[02:09:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: or jQuery(this).find('option[value="+ jQuery(this).val() +"]').text() if you prefer that
[02:09:26] <optraz> i have a checkbox , now how do i check if the checkbox has the attribute checked ?
[02:09:49] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Is one better than the other, the first works fine, just curious
[02:10:17] <Cork> optraz: $(this).prop('checked') or $(this).is(':checked')
[02:10:43] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the second one should be a tiny bit faster if your working with big select boxes, but your not
[02:10:52] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Cool thanks
[02:10:58] <optraz> Cork: i ahve this    $("#check").is(":checked") {
[02:10:58] <optraz> 	   $(".user_new").show();
[02:10:58] <optraz>        $(".user_existing").hide();
[02:11:02] <optraz>    }not sure if tis  correct
[02:11:25] <Cork> optraz: please use a pb site
[02:11:33] <optraz> !pastebin
[02:11:36] <optraz> ~pastebin
[02:11:41] <Cork> the bot is dead
[02:11:50] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is nice
[02:12:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Because I'm using conflicting libraries, is there a website I can use to just type in my URL and check for errors in JS etc?
[02:12:43] <fRAiLtY-> I just want to be sure
[02:13:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that would really be nice, but not that i know of
[02:13:10] <fRAiLtY-> kk
[02:13:13] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: js testers only allow the js code
[02:13:21] <fRAiLtY-> Gotcha
[02:13:29] <optraz> Cork: $(this).is(':checked') <== how does it execute other statement? i want to execute a few statements if the checkbox is checked.
[02:13:43] <Cork> optraz: if($(this).is(':checked'))
[02:13:46] <asher^> use an 'if'
[02:14:20] <Sinner> I'v added the code to jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U37dG/
[02:14:27] <optraz> if ( $("#check").is(":checked") ) <<== is that correct?
[02:14:47] <Cork> yes
[02:15:02] <Cork> you might want {} to wrap the following code
[02:15:14] <optraz> ohh noted
[02:15:27] <Cork> Sinner: whats your question?
[02:15:39] <Cork> Sinner: btw you have an undeclared variable there
[02:15:49] <Cork> should prob do var position = 0...
[02:15:50] <Sinner> I'm trying to get the hight of an ul
[02:16:01] <optraz> feel foolish
[02:16:02] <optraz> :(
[02:16:07] <optraz> sorry for stupid question
[02:16:10] <optraz> thanks Cork
[02:16:16] <Cork> Sinner: http://jsfiddle.net/U37dG/1/
[02:16:21] <Sinner> but i always get null in return
[02:16:34] <Cork> your calculating the the function reference
[02:16:40] <Cork> not the return value :)
[02:17:01] <Sinner> mhm?
[02:17:03] <Sinner> :)
[02:17:20] <Cork> .height instead of .height()
[02:17:28] <Cork> its a function
[02:17:44] <Sinner> ah, ok, let me try that
[02:17:57] <Cork> don't for get the var infront of position
[02:18:38] <Sinner> is that realy needed? i thought vars ar just the same even without var?
[02:18:52] <Cork> its global if you don't declare it
[02:19:16] <Cork> position = something; is the same as window.position = something;
[02:19:29] <Sinner> ah… ok
[02:19:49] <Sinner> now i get Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[02:21:02] <Cork> Sinner: is .level_2 a sibling to .level_1 li ?
[02:21:12] <Sinner> yep
[02:21:18] <Cork> or is it a sibling to .level_1 ?
[02:22:34] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: So, I'm moving onto the next step in my script now. I have a matrix table below the options that I'm attemtping to reload based on the value of the drop-down. So, here's my script. It's all part of the same page, is this likely to be a problem? The function is getMatrix so I guess I pass my variable to the file that has the function in? Or would it be better to have the argument as part of the function and pass it in the same file?
[02:22:34] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/3575901 for table reload
[02:22:48] <Sinner> <ul class="level_1"><li class="has_sibling"><ul class="level_2">
[02:23:05] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just thinking of the url: ajax command
[02:23:53] <Sinner> </ul></li></ul>
[02:23:53] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: thats php, you can't pass anything there
[02:24:03] <Cork> you need to use ajax and handle the response
[02:24:14] <Cork> or you need to do it in js
[02:24:35] <Cork> Sinner: ah, so its a child of the li?
[02:24:45] <Cork> Sinner: then next won't work
[02:25:27] <Cork> Sinner: next only works if .level_2 is the sibling directly following the li
[02:25:42] <Cork> <ul class="level_1"><li class="has_sibling"/><li class="level_2"/></ul>
[02:26:03] <Cork> so you need to use .find instead
[02:26:13] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: So my PHP table is useless?
[02:26:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you can't have it inline at least
[02:26:29] <fRAiLtY-> It generates the table, I just want to change the variable it acts on in ajax and reload ?
[02:26:54] <Cork> you could handle it as a form post that replaces the entire page
[02:27:06] <fRAiLtY-> Or I could put it as part of the function ?
[02:27:09] <fRAiLtY-> php function that is
[02:27:24] <Cork> you need to get the value from js to server side somehow
[02:27:30] <fRAiLtY-> idd
[02:27:31] <Cork> or convert the redraw to js
[02:28:12] <fRAiLtY-> So if I place the table code in the PHP function, can I call the php function file "again" when the drop-down is selected thus redrawing the table ?
[02:28:30] <Cork> sure, through ajax
[02:28:31] <Sinner> ok thx… meeting now.. will be back after with one more question :)
[02:28:38] <Cork> and then replace the table with js
[02:28:55] <fRAiLtY-> A whole js table ?
[02:29:02] <Cork> no
[02:29:22] <Cork> wither do a normal post and reload the entire page the php writes the new table
[02:29:34] <fRAiLtY-> I don't want to reload the entire page if I can help it
[02:29:41] <Cork> or you do a ajax call to a separat php file that renders the table, and js replaces the old one with the new
[02:30:07] <Cork> then ajax is prob what you want
[02:31:04] <fRAiLtY-> Yes, option 2 sounds good. so I could use the "seperate php file" which is my function file, it only has 2 functions in it, 1 for this table and 1 that does something else. I could place the PHP table code in there, then pass the variable "value" to that php file which using ajax will reload that table only with new values ?
[02:32:08] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('#table-container').load('/table/generator.php, { value: option });
[02:32:15] <Cork> thats prob the simplest form to do it
[02:32:37] <Cork> add the table in a wrapping div or simipar and just replace it with .load
[02:33:47] <LukeNukem> How can i detect a click inside a textarea?
[02:34:33] <Cork> normal .click should work
[02:34:48] <LukeNukem> does not
[02:34:49] <LukeNukem> :\
[02:34:50] <tankbuggie> Hi guys! Im using Tinysort, and want to sort tables, but I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to sort the rows based on an "value"-attribute of an input inside the rows, Have anyone here used Tinysort this way before?
[02:35:02] <LukeNukem> maybe onfocus?
[02:35:03] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Presumably I still need a PHP call to call that function within that div initially though, right? else it won't display anything?
[02:35:57] <ascii`> Hi, i have a slideshow like this http://pastie.org/3576364 that change the image using a timer, now i would like to switch to a specific image when the user clicks a link. What is the best practice in this case?
[02:36:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the call happens in the php file
[02:36:15] <LukeNukem> Cork, is focus an event?
[02:36:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: .load is what executes the file
[02:36:24] <Cork> LukeNukem: yes
[02:36:38] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/f78rn/
[02:36:44] <Cork> click works fine here
[02:36:47] <ascii`> Normally i would use onclick or the javascript: handler but my quess is that's not the JQuery way to do things
[02:37:15] <Cork> ascii`: actually thats the 20 year old legacy way to do it :=
[02:37:22] <Cork> *;)
[02:37:43] <ascii`> Cork, i'm a little late :)
[02:38:21] <Cork> ascii`: $('container for the links').on('click', 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $(this)... });
[02:38:32] <LukeNukem> so Cork im expanding the elements height on click and yes now it works..so once clicked it expands, but second time also it expands
[02:38:36] <LukeNukem> how can i avoid the second time expand?
[02:39:02] <Cork> LukeNukem: add a class to the element when clicked?
[02:39:10] <metasin_tactic> hola
[02:39:18] <ascii`> Cork, thanks! did not know about event.preventDefault()
[02:39:21] <Cork> LukeNukem: then check .hasClass('expanded')
[02:39:37] <LukeNukem> what?
[02:39:59] <Cork> heh or just use a class
[02:40:38] <metasin_tactic> anyone have time for a jquery mobile css question?
[02:40:51] <Cork> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/f78rn/1/
[02:41:09] <LukeNukem> i did this instead :P
[02:41:09] <LukeNukem> var height = $(this).css("height");
[02:41:10] <LukeNukem>    if(height != '80px'){
[02:41:19] <xec> metasin_tactic: we will never know if you don't post the question ;)
[02:41:26] <metasin_tactic> lol
[02:41:54] <SoulRaven> anyone use dataTables plugin?
[02:41:55] <Cork> LukeNukem: uhh, thats kinda nasty
[02:42:07] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: But, surely I'll still need echo getMatrix() to display a table on loading of the page, then the dropdown manipulates it further/
[02:42:16] <fRAiLtY-> when the table is part of the function
[02:42:17] <xec> SoulRaven: most likely
[02:42:26] <metasin_tactic> I'm new to jquery mobile and trying to achieve a splitscreen effect the same as http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[02:42:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: js gets what you echo in the separat php file yes
[02:42:35] <metasin_tactic> but not having any luck finding documentation for it
[02:42:40] <xec> SoulRaven: just post your question, maybe someone can answer
[02:42:49] <metasin_tactic> I'd rather not use a plugin
[02:42:56] <SoulRaven> xec: i have a few question regarding some parameters and variabiles
[02:43:09] <xec> SoulRaven: that's not a question :)
[02:43:11] <metasin_tactic> I'm assuming it's something to do with css, but not sure
[02:43:14] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: So I should have NO PHP regarding this table, not even a function call, inline with the JS in the same file, this should all be handled in the seperate php file ?
[02:43:25] <SoulRaven> i try to make a server side processing, but i don't know what is "sEcho" => intval($_GET['sEcho']),
[02:43:41] <xec> SoulRaven: this is a PHP question?
[02:43:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: well if you want to pre render something when you first send the initial page, that should be there yes
[02:43:52] <Cork> xec: not really
[02:44:05] <xec> Cork: looks like php to me?
[02:44:06] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: But this won't effect the js/ajax
[02:44:20] <SoulRaven> xec: a dataTables question, because i don't know what is processed by the datatables
[02:44:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: buit php is run before something is sent to the browser, so it doens't matter when you want to update it
[02:44:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: exactly
[02:44:35] <fRAiLtY-> gdgd
[02:44:37] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: cause its not part of the page anymore
[02:44:39] <SoulRaven> sEcho is part of a json response to datatable
[02:45:35] <xec> SoulRaven: looks like its a counter http://datatables.net/usage/server-side
[02:45:38] <SoulRaven> i have find my sele:) http://datatables.net/usage/server-side
[02:46:03] <xec> :)
[02:47:18] <xec> metasin_tactic: i don't see a "split screen effect" at the url you gave... unless you mean the left hand menu?
[02:47:27] <amirite> how do i bind an event for elements that don't exist in the dom yet
[02:47:30] <amirite> it used to be .live
[02:47:34] <metasin_tactic> xec: yeah. that's what I mean
[02:48:11] <amirite> i tried jQuery('.non-existant').click(function(){stuff});jQuery('.foo').append('<div class="non-existant">more stuff</div>') with no luck getting the vent to fire
[02:49:52] <xec> metasin_tactic: yes, this is css - and it won't be split screen on your mobile
[02:50:04] <amirite> why is .live deprecated w/out a replace
[02:50:10] <metasin_tactic> xec: it works okay on my tablet
[02:50:13] <metasin_tactic> via the website
[02:50:22] <xec> metasin_tactic: yes, it depends on the screen width
[02:50:31] <xec> metasin_tactic: but if you want two cols, have a look at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-grids.html
[02:51:01] <metasin_tactic> xec: hmm. I'd rather have it work based on device width, rather than using grids
[02:51:08] <metasin_tactic> just like the page I posted
[02:51:54] <metasin_tactic> which I presume is why jquery's site uses that method rather than grids
[02:51:57] <xec> metasin_tactic: ok, maybe this can help? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/mediahelpers.html
[02:52:21] <xec> specifically the breakpoint classes
[02:52:46] <metasin_tactic> xec: tx. I'll give it a shot.
[02:52:58] <xec> you can of course also use plain css media queries
[02:53:53] <xec> amirite: .on() can do exactly what live does
[02:54:06] <metasin_tactic> xec: thanks. :)
[02:54:50] <xec> amirite: $(document).on("click", ".selector", func) is the same as $(".selector").live("click", func)
[02:54:57] <xec> iirc
[02:56:13] <xec> amirite: all you need is on (and love)
[03:02:35] <soee> someone familiar with validator plugin and positioning error messages ?
[03:11:38] <D4> Hm, if I have "main.js", can I include other files in it? Like jQ UI, jQ ScrollTo, etc etc instead of having like 5 <script src="" type="text/javascript"></style> etc?
[03:12:04] <D4> Or "call" on them in main.js and only do <script src="main.js">..?
[03:12:45] <Cork> D4: you can use getScript to load script dynamically
[03:12:58] <Cork> D4: but you prob want to use something server side to concatinalt the script files
[03:13:05] <Cork> to reduce the load time of your page
[03:14:54] <D4> Cork : Something server side? I'm not entirely sure what you mean, the scripts are located on the server, except for jQuery (grabbed from google) but I can dl that as well - but how do you mean? :)
[03:15:31] <Cork> D4: if you include files as <script> or through getScript they are loaded as separat connections to the server
[03:15:46] <Cork> D4: there is a limit to the number of those the browser will open at any given time
[03:15:54] <Cork> D4: that results in load delay
[03:16:23] <Cork> D4: so normally when you put a site in production you run a script that combine the different js files to one long file
[03:16:49] <D4> ah, "minified" as well I guess? Any tools for this?
[03:17:16] <Cork> well minification is additionally
[03:17:28] <Cork> there is a few scripts out there
[03:18:40] <D4> Thanks
[03:19:06] <Cork> np
[03:30:17] <soee> how can i detemrine id element with class X is radio input?
[03:32:38] <Cork> soee: you want to identify the id or the element type?
[03:33:02] <bluenavajo> hello everyone
[03:33:27] <soee> Cork, type. just found that i can obtain it by calling attr method
[03:35:45] <bluenavajo> Maybe someone can help me. I am looking for a js effect (jquery or not) where photos are displayed in a carousel. It should be like photos placed on a desk overlapping each other and if the user clicks on one of them the photo should be on top. Does somebody know of something like this?
[03:37:01] <faithlove> hi. anyone experienced with jqgrid?
[03:37:59] <ShawnRisk> when I use any jquery code to change a textbox text to uppercase, and when to use that on the site elsewhere it is still thinking I am in lowercase.  How do I fix this?
[03:41:15] <Xotix> I'm having a bar at the left, if i hover ov er it, a div should appear. IWhat should i use for this?
[03:45:39] <Cork> Xotix: mouseenter and mouseleave if you want to bar to only show when you hover it
[03:46:15] <Cork> Xotix: if you want to be able to hover the div and still see the div, make it a child of the bar and it should work
[03:46:28] <Xotix> I mean which effect. slide? Should look nice.
[03:48:26] <Cork> ah
[03:48:49] <Cork> the normal show('slow') effect should look ok too
[03:49:00] <Cork> depends on what should show it
[03:49:55] <Xotix> actually, it is a ul. It also is draggable (or it's lis are draggable). applying the slide effect does nothing somehow. Isn't it possible to apply a effect onto an draggable?
[03:50:35] <nathansmith> Does anyone know of a script that allows for multiple sliding div panels on a page?
[03:50:36] <nathansmith> I c
[03:50:47] <nathansmith> I can't find one that copes with varying panel quantities
[03:51:17] <Cork> Xotix: it should allow it, animations doesn't really have anything with draggable to do until the user actually drag them
[03:51:43] <Xotix> hmm ok
[03:55:52] <thesolidsnake> Whats the easiest way to make a div swap places with another div. For example if I drag a div on top of a droppable . I then want the original location of the draggable to turn to a droppable ? Basically the draggable and the doppable swap places ?
[03:55:57] <thesolidsnake> Easiest way to implement ?
[03:56:37] <Blaster> Why would I be getting Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[name=subscriptionTotal
[03:59:36] <fubhy> thesolidsnake get both parents, then move element a into element b parent, then move element b into previous element a parent
[04:00:12] <Xotix> Cork, i have e.g. 4 images. I'm also having edit icons. THe edit icons are position: absolute and then i get the position of the images and set the position of the edit icons. So they are in the left upper corner of the images. If you now resize the browser window. The edit icon's position is wrong, is there a better way to position them?
[04:00:47] <aadilcifer> If i want my page to scroll to a div on some event what to use
[04:00:57] <ShawnRisk> when I use any jquery code to change a textbox text to uppercase, and when to use that on the site elsewhere it is still thinking I am in lowercase.  How do I fix this?
[04:01:00] <Cork> Blaster: add quotes around your attribute
[04:01:17] <xec> thesolidsnake: i would make two droppables, one in each position, and the div draggable
[04:01:17] <Cork> Blaster: 'input[name="subscriptionTotal"]'
[04:01:38] <xec> thesolidsnake: then you can just drag it back and forth
[04:01:54] <Cork> Xotix: through pure css
[04:02:09] <Cork> Xotix: you mean you put the edit icon as an overlay over the image?
[04:02:20] <Xotix> yes
[04:02:40] <Xotix> Cork i can achieve that via css?
[04:02:45] <Cork> then add a wrapper display: inline-block; position: relative; div around the image
[04:02:46] <thesolidsnake> when a draggable is placed on a droppable does the droppable disappear ? Where does it go ?
[04:03:09] <Cork> and then position the image with something like position: absolute; top: 5px right: 5px;
[04:03:09] <xec> thesolidsnake: it's still there, you can do what you want with it though
[04:03:27] <Cork> Xotix: and no need to recalculate :)
[04:03:37] <xec> thesolidsnake: but, i might have misunderstood what you need
[04:03:49] <xec> thesolidsnake: what is the use case?
[04:03:54] <Xotix> Cork, hmm I'm gonna try that thanks
[04:04:20] <thesolidsnake> xec  - here :  http://oi44.tinypic.com/dr4ili.jpg
[04:04:41] <thesolidsnake> When A gets dragged onto white space. the white space div moves to the location where a was
[04:04:49] <ShawnRisk> Any ideas with my problem?
[04:06:10] <Cork> ShawnRisk: what are you using to make the text upercase?
[04:06:13] <xec> thesolidsnake: ah, i see. i'm not sure what the best implementation would be. i might do something like have 9 droppables ( one for each spot ) and only allow you to drop if empty
[04:06:17] <Cork> *uppercase
[04:06:43] <xec> thesolidsnake: and the 8 tiles would be draggables
[04:07:03] <ShawnRisk> Cork: $(function() {   $('#edit-panes-delivery-delivery-postal-code').focusout(function() { this.value = this.value.toLocaleUpperCase(); }); });
[04:07:17] <thesolidsnake> hmmm how do you implement to only drop if empty
[04:07:26] <Patrik> Hi, is there a way to fetch all POST/GET data generating elements in a form so I can send it with AJAX. I don't want to build the data string / map manually for every form submit.
[04:07:55] <thesolidsnake> is there an option
[04:08:34] <Cork> Patrik: .serialize() or .serializeArray()
[04:09:19] <Patrik> Cork, Ah sweet, thanks!
[04:09:38] <ShawnRisk> Cork: ideas?
[04:09:43] <xec> thesolidsnake: yes, i think its called "accept"
[04:10:07] <xec> thesolidsnake: which takes a function
[04:10:11] <Cork> ShawnRisk: weird...
[04:10:26] <ShawnRisk> why?
[04:10:38] <Cork> ShawnRisk: try using setTimeout to give the element some time to update before you fiddle with it
[04:10:41] <thesolidsnake> so i have to create a function to check if empty ?
[04:10:47] <jobbmon> so like, whats the best way to get rid of 'px' from css results?
[04:10:48] <Cork> ShawnRisk: your code looks like it should work just fine
[04:11:10] <ShawnRisk> Cork: yes but other parts of the site are rendering this as lowercase
[04:11:11] <xec> thesolidsnake: right - at least that's what i would do - there might be a better way
[04:11:32] <Cork> ShawnRisk: yes, thats why i said try setTimeout
[04:11:32] <mindis|wurk> jobbmon you can use parseint, though you could just use .height() etc. for certain properties which return a numerical value
[04:12:12] <Cork> ShawnRisk: var self=this; setTimeout(function() { self.value = self.value.toLocaleUpperCase(); },0);
[04:12:18] <Cork> that MIGHT solve the problem
[04:12:53] <thesolidsnake> xec whats wrong with getting the position left and position top for the div when I start to drag, then when I drop on the white square div, i change the position of this white square div to the position i stored earlier so it moves to where the div I dragged from ?
[04:12:56] <ShawnRisk> Cork: within the focusout?
[04:12:59] <jobbmon> mindis|wurk, is there a height() equivalent for offset().top ?
[04:13:00] <Cork> yes
[04:13:30] <xec> thesolidsnake: that sounds feasible too
[04:13:33] <jobbmon> uhm
[04:13:39] <thesolidsnake> cool
[04:13:52] <jobbmon> nvm
[04:13:56] <Xotix> does te slide effect has a option revers? so it goes back?
[04:14:12] <jobbmon> it was css('padding-top') that gave me the 'px'. i guess parseInt is the way to go then
[04:14:24] <mindis|wurk> hehe
[04:14:28] <xec> thesolidsnake: do you have the html for the starting point (the image) ?
[04:14:36] <mduerksen> http://dev.jquery.com/ is down?
[04:14:42] <Sinner> back :)
[04:14:48] <thesolidsnake> xec what do you mean ?
[04:15:05] <xec> thesolidsnake: the screenshot, is that html?
[04:15:14] <thesolidsnake> yeh
[04:15:27] <xec> thesolidsnake: could you paste it in a fiddle?
[04:17:14] <ShawnRisk> Cork: that didn't work out for me.
[04:17:16] <thesolidsnake> xec 1 sec
[04:17:53] <Sinner> can someone pls take a look at that? (http://jsfiddle.net/U37dG/2/)
[04:18:17] <Sinner> Basically I want to place the subnavi on top of the main nav
[04:18:38] <xec> Sinner: <ul level_1> <-- did you mean to write <ul class="level_1"> ?
[04:18:50] <Sinner> oh… yep :)
[04:19:01] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if you echo the value from the console does it show it as lower case there too=
[04:19:04] <Cork> *?
[04:19:38] <Xotix> Cork, if i have a div with position: fixed; if i hover over it, some other element slides in. the page gets a big height and i scroll down. if i now hover over my div, the element appears, but in the top, on the wrong position. Is there a nice trick for this? or do i need to update the position on Scroll or something?
[04:20:05] <Sinner> Cork said: next() aint working in this case..
[04:20:18] <Xotix> Cork i got it, forgot something… sry
[04:20:27] <Sinner> how do i find the ul(level_2) belonging to the li
[04:21:00] <Cork> Sinner: if .level_2 is a child of li use .find('.level_2')
[04:22:36] <Sinner> mhm.. still returning Unexpected token ILLEGAL#
[04:22:40] <ShawnRisk> Cork: it is outputted as uppercase in console, and the first time I enter text into that textfield, this seems to work, but afterwards nope.
[04:24:05] <Cork> ShawnRisk: weird, no clude then
[04:24:30] <ShawnRisk> Cork: let me try something
[04:25:06] <thesolidsnake> xec lol - http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/3/
[04:25:12] <thesolidsnake> it doesnt work at min tho
[04:25:12] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[04:27:30] <thesolidsnake> Think i will use this
[04:27:31] <thesolidsnake> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8545230/prevent-clone-floating-back-when-swapping-items-with-jquery-ui
[04:28:36] <xec> thesolidsnake: i don't think it should be too hard, fixed the start of your attempt slightly http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/4/
[04:29:38] <thesolidsnake> xec then the other problem is that you can only move the squares that are next to the white square and you can't move diagonally
[04:29:49] <thesolidsnake> so i have to implement that
[04:29:52] <xec> thesolidsnake: yes, that's another hurdle ;)
[04:30:37] <ShawnRisk> Cork: do you want to see where the problem is?
[04:35:17] <Sinner> got it.. just had to re-write every line.. cause there was some invisible character
[04:36:27] <thesolidsnake> xec so I can do something like this to swap =   http://jsfiddle.net/7BGjD/2/
[04:37:32] <xec> thesolidsnake: that doesn't look like it's working - did you write this?
[04:38:07] <thesolidsnake> try this now
[04:38:08] <thesolidsnake> http://jsfiddle.net/7BGjD/4/
[04:38:22] <xec> thesolidsnake: this is just positioning using top/left pixels - would make it hard to figure out what tiles you are allowed to slide later on
[04:38:43] <thesolidsnake> so wat do you recommend to do it like ?
[04:38:55] <thesolidsnake> i dont know whats best way to implement like what method to use
[04:39:04] <xec> thesolidsnake: i would suggest using grid-like markup and swap the DOM elements
[04:40:13] <xec> thesolidsnake: that way you can find neighbours and add "valid move" classes
[04:40:16] <xec> for instance
[04:40:32] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/ if you hover over the blue div, drag an item, and drag it around. it disapepars but you still got it. if you hvoer back to the div, you see, you still got it. How can i make it visible/relative to the body?
[04:41:31] <thesolidsnake> its meant to be simply :P Its for a university coursework and this restriction business is only worth like 3 marks out of 30 :P . The guy said it was simple to do lol
[04:42:44] <xec> thesolidsnake: well.. i wouldn't call this basic, really
[04:43:19] <mindis|wurk> i haven't followed the conversation but from what i saw in the beginning seemed pretty trivial
[04:44:50] <xec> mindis|wurk: well, it is a basic idea, simple slider puzzle - but implementation with jquery ui isn't very hard, it's just not trivial either ;)
[04:45:25] <mindis|wurk> dunno, isn't it just jqueryui draggables with a couple of simple checks
[04:47:09] <xec> mindis|wurk: maybe you know some tricks i don't
[04:47:45] <mindis|wurk> i'm a goddamn wizard
[04:47:51] <xec> i'm quite new at draggables, only implemented one for production use so far ;)
[04:47:52] <mindis|wurk> no, actually i'm pretty much a jquery noob
[04:48:12] <Xotix> Can i disconnect a draggable from it's parent? So it doesn't get's hidden if the parent gets hidden?
[04:48:25] <thesolidsnake> xec   ok so i have this (lets forget bout restrictions at the minute )  - http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/7/    . Is there an easy way to change this so that when I drag a square theres white space and not a duplicate under it ?
[04:48:46] <xec> thesolidsnake: sure, just don't use clone as helper
[04:49:04] <thesolidsnake> if i take away clone helper it doesnt work :P
[04:49:29] <xec> thats true :D
[04:49:48] <thesolidsnake> so whys that :P
[04:50:30] <xec> thesolidsnake: because you're hiding it after it's done
[04:50:39] <xec> thesolidsnake: comment out the $(ui.helper).hide();
[04:50:44] <Xotix> thesolidsnake:  what do you mean, under it?
[04:51:15] <thesolidsnake> like when you drag square A  , there is another square A there , i want there to just be one square A when dragging
[04:51:34] <thesolidsnake> so if you drag square A it will be white space underneath
[04:51:34] <xec> thesolidsnake: http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/12/
[04:52:25] <thesolidsnake> xec that works :) but why does it have to do this weird annimation thing :P
[04:53:25] <thesolidsnake> can you stop the animation from happening
[04:53:25] <xec> you know what, i'm not sure
[04:53:39] <xec> i don't see why it would animate it
[04:53:44] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/ If you hover over the blue bar, drag an item and drag it around, the bar somehow wil ldisappear. The nthe item also disappears. How can i prevent the item from disappearing?
[04:54:45] <thesolidsnake> Its  to do with   " revert: true  "  its because its reverting back but you've moved the location of it or something
[04:54:55] <thesolidsnake> if you take out   revert: true from draggable it doesnt do it
[04:55:32] <xec> ahh
[04:55:38] <xec> thesolidsnake: revertDuration: 0
[04:56:09] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/15/
[04:56:35] <thesolidsnake> sorted
[04:56:36] <thesolidsnake> :)
[04:57:31] <thesolidsnake> right i need to understand this code now :P . See for the part thats -    left: dragPos.left + 'px'    .  Whats the px referrring to ?
[04:58:12] <mindis|wurk> is it even necessary to tinker with the css...
[04:59:21] <thesolidsnake> ?
[04:59:57] <xec> mindis|wurk: my thought exactly
[05:00:22] <thesolidsnake> So i dont need to mess with the css?
[05:00:32] <luffha> guys, anyone knows an alternative to this plugin for page slide? http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/pageslide/
[05:01:18] <xec> thesolidsnake: like i said earlier, you should be able to just swap the DOM elements rather than keep overwriting position
[05:01:48] <mindis|wurk> btw were you required to use divs and not use a table?
[05:01:50] <thesolidsnake> how do you swap dom elements :P
[05:01:58] <thesolidsnake> yeah meant to use divs
[05:02:03] <mindis|wurk> k
[05:02:29] <thesolidsnake> http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/18/
[05:02:33] <thesolidsnake> I took away the css stuff
[05:02:45] <thesolidsnake> so now is it just swapping them and not writting position ?
[05:02:50] <xec> yes
[05:02:54] <xec> much better ;)
[05:04:34] <xec> thesolidsnake: simplified a bit http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/21/
[05:06:37] <thesolidsnake> Thanks :) . So does the function  jQuery.fn.swap , which i didnt write. Just basically remove the div your dragging, then insert it again before a certain div and the droppable div is removed and inserted before a certain div too >
[05:06:38] <thesolidsnake> ?
[05:07:25] <Bartzy> Hi
[05:07:32] <Bartzy> if I have calls to a slider plugin
[05:07:52] <Bartzy> $('#slideshow1').nivoSlider({..}); $('#slideshow2').nivoSlider({..});  $('#slideshow3').nivoSlider({..});
[05:07:57] <Bartzy> Can I somehow make all 3 start at the same time ?
[05:09:29] <gob> $('#slide1, #slide2, #slide3').nivoSlider({...});
[05:09:32] <xec> thesolidsnake: the .swap() just swaps elements placement in the DOM, i believe
[05:12:38] <Bartzy> gob: This does it in the same time ?
[05:13:28] <gob> more or less, the plugin probably has an internal loop for the element arguments
[05:14:58] <gob> Bartzy: or you can try setting up the various sliders, and then calling start() on them all
[05:15:04] <gob> that might be closer
[05:15:07] <gob> $('#slider').data('nivoslider').start();
[05:26:54] <thesolidsnake> how do i create my own function in jquery
[05:29:52] <xec> thesolidsnake: you mean plugin?
[05:30:28] <thesolidsnake> i just want to make a function like checkblocks  then when i call  checkblocks(); it does the function
[05:30:35] <thesolidsnake> like in c# lol
[05:30:47] <mindis|wurk> you can use regular javascript functions
[05:31:48] <xec> thesolidsnake: what mindis|wurk said - jQuery is just a javascript library - to create a function just write plain old javascript: function checkblocks(args) { ... }
[05:32:40] <thesolidsnake> I no nothing about javascript or jquery :P  . Only c# and programming languages and html and bit of php
[05:32:43] <thesolidsnake> know*
[05:34:47] <xec> thesolidsnake: http://eloquentjavascript.net/ is a good book, and https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/ is a good reference
[05:35:02] <xec> if you really want to learn ;)
[05:35:44] <mindis|wurk> blasted iframe keeps covering my toolbar div
[05:36:32] <mindis|wurk> i wonder what trickery could be used to prevent that. pointer-events: none; did the trick but then you can't do anything with the iframe, not even use the scrollbar
[05:37:23] <Bartzy> gob: What does that mean? the start ?
[05:38:30] <gob> it only runs the start function. basically if you're worried about them all being started at exactly the same instant, do the setup routine first. (which might take a few miliseconds) and then start them all at the same time

[05:45:22] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: ?
[05:45:29] <Cork> sup
[05:46:46] <fRAiLtY-> Yo, I've managed to get the php in a seperate file, so I need some assistance AJAX'ing up my drop-down from earlier. Here's my code http://pastie.org/3577321 I need to pass the variable "stock" to my PHP file
[05:46:50] <fRAiLtY-> Configurable.php
[05:47:35] <elfrancesco> I have in my environment (sp2010), many jquery instances running on the same page (which is bad ... i know) and a few jQuery plugins attached to differents instances. My pb is i am trying to create a sort of loop which iterate through each instance of jquery using noConflict() to find which one has my plugin attached. I have written the code http://jsfiddle.net/SrnHS/7/ but i have troubles because sometimes (dunno when) i end the
[05:48:01] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: .load('url', { stock: stock });
[05:48:05] <elfrancesco> i understand my explaination is certainly not very understandable but i would appreciate anyhelp
[05:48:13] <Cork> $_GET['stock']
[05:48:21] <fRAiLtY-> Where do I put that?
[05:48:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: did you put your table in a container element?
[05:48:50] <fRAiLtY-> Yes, in matrixContainer div
[05:48:57] <Cork> an id?
[05:49:02] <Cork> or class?
[05:49:52] <aqeel> hi room
[05:50:21] <fRAiLtY-> id
[05:50:37] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then put $('#matrixContainer').load('<url>', { stock: stock }); after line 9 (replace <url> with the url to your php file)
[05:50:49] <creati29> would it be a bad idea to create a function that has an ajax call within it and send it parameters for data, url etc to save me having to write an ajax call each time a form is submitted on my page?
[05:51:07] <creati29> or would it be better to keep them all seperate?
[05:51:30] <Cork> creati29: code deduplication is usually good, makes the code simpler to manage
[05:53:06] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Do I not need all the .ajax stuff below?
[05:53:10] <fRAiLtY-> That's commented out?
[05:53:26] <Cork> not for this no
[05:54:44] <thesolidsnake> When dragstart function is fired how can I stop a drag from happening
[05:54:54] <Fire-_-Fly> hi can anyone give me a quick solution? I have a image who's hover event is set. now I have another link hovering on that I want to trigger the hover event of the image. But it is not working as expected: http://pastebin.com/skiQqMJY
[05:55:35] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: What's the syntax for using that variable in the PHP now?
[05:55:49] <Cork> $_GET['stock']
[05:56:59] <liampotter_> @fire-_-fly you need to trigger the mouseover or mouseout event
[05:57:27] <Fire-_-Fly> liampotter_: ok, lemme try.
[05:59:39] <liampotter_> remember to assign the function to the mouseover event before triggering
[05:59:41] <Fire-_-Fly> liampotter_: thanks. It works. But don't understand why hover doesn't work the same way. That is also an event, right?
[06:00:33] <liampotter_> well, it has two events attached, mouseover and mouseout if you were to trigger hover, it wouldn't know when to trigger the mouseout event.
[06:01:18] <Fire-_-Fly> ok, makes sense. and works perfectly.
[06:03:32] <elfrancesco> I have problems with the following code if somecan help... http://jsfiddle.net/SrnHS/12/
[06:06:54] <crazydiamond> Hi. What's best way to convert regular array/dict into JSON (i.e. it's string representation)
[06:07:58] <Cork> elfrancesco: your releaseing $ and then your trying to reference it on $
[06:08:06] <Cork> *reference .fv on it
[06:08:13] <Cork> ... *.fn
[06:08:59] <gob> crazydiamond JSON.stringify
[06:09:49] <creati29> i'm trying to handle the success of the ajax call by returning data from the server like so -
[06:09:50] <Cork> elfrancesco: and next itteration your trying to use $.maphilight where $ isn't jQuery
[06:10:02] <crazydiamond> gob: thanks
[06:10:17] <creati29> success: function(data) {  obj = $.parseJSON(data); return obj; };
[06:10:48] <Cork> creati29: use dataType: 'json' and jquery will do that for you
[06:10:52] <gob> creati29: it already gets parsed
[06:11:05] <gob> data is already the object
[06:11:20] <gob> but you can't just return it
[06:11:29] <gob> cause it's an async call
[06:11:30] <creati29> I think its because i havnt set json header on the server side, its formatted as json but isn't actually if that makes sense
[06:12:04] <creati29> gob: that's where i was going, how can i return it as everything else is firing around it leaving me with lots of things undefined :P
[06:12:12] <Cork> you can't
[06:12:17] <gob> you gotta call doSomethingWithTheData(data)
[06:12:22] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/1/ if you drag an item around and the list disappears, the element also disappears. HOw can i make is visible? doing $(this) in the start event, gives me the origin item and not my dragged one
[06:12:47] <Cork> creati29: your function can take a callback as an argument and you can use that for example
[06:13:05] <gob> creati29: show me your code
[06:13:18] <creati29> cork: i've tried that too, but its the callback function isn't firing
[06:13:29] <creati29> i'll do a pastebin in just a mo, thanks for your help guys
[06:13:59] <elfrancesco> Cork: i know but i don't understand how i can leave the loop when there are no more instances of $ ?
[06:14:28] <Cork> elfrancesco: if($ !== jQuery) { break; } ?
[06:17:09] <elfrancesco> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/SrnHS/18/  i don't think this statement is ok because when i call noConflict() the jQuery var stay the same whereas the $ is poped out of the "stack" so in my case it leave the loop but there are still others instances of jquery in $
[06:20:54] <smudge> On website when I press download (on the homepage) I get "/*! jQuery v1.7.1 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */ (function(a,b){function cy(a){return f.isWindow(a)?a:a.nodeType===9?a.defaultView||a.parentWindow:!1}function cv(a){if(!ck[a]){var b=c.body,d=f("<"+a+">").appendTo(b),e=d.css("display");d.remove();if(e==="none"||e===""){cl||(cl=c.createElement("iframe"),cl.frameBorder=cl.width=cl.height=0),b.appendChild(cl);if(!cm||!cl.create
[06:21:07] <smudge> anyone know who I should report that to?
[06:21:25] <Cork> elfrancesco: http://jsfiddle.net/SrnHS/20/

[06:22:30] <Xotix> Shouldn't $('.ui-draggable-dragging') return me the element i'm czrrently dragging?
[06:22:50] <Trisox> check documentation ;)
[06:23:38] <Trisox> Xotix: events part
[06:23:47] <Trisox> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#event-drag
[06:23:48] <mindis|wurk> i'd question if you even need to get that element that way
[06:24:07] <smudge> It says "minified and gzipped on the button. I just get the code. I would expect it to prompt to save the file. Looks broken to me.
[06:25:15] <Xotix> Trisox so?  This event is triggered when the mouse is moved during the dragging.  I want to get the object which is currently getting dragged around, to manipulate its css.
[06:25:23] <Cork> smudge: is that the download for jquery or jquery-ui?
[06:25:31] <elfrancesco> Thanks Cork for the loop  there still seems to be a pb since my if ($.maphilight) doesn't permit me to check wether the plugin is attached to the current $ instance...
[06:25:54] <Cork> elfrancesco: how does the plugin work?
[06:26:01] <Cork> elfrancesco: does it take a selector?
[06:26:10] <Cork> $('seletor').maphilight =
[06:26:13] <Cork> *?
[06:26:14] <elfrancesco> it attach a maphilight() function to fn
[06:26:34] <Cork> ah, then you need to check $.fn.maphilight
[06:27:05] <elfrancesco> Thanks Cork i am just stupid
[06:27:13] <elfrancesco> that works well now thanks again
[06:27:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/SrnHS/27/
[06:27:23] <Cork> uh...
[06:27:30] <Cork> ya
[06:27:45] <smudge> download for JQuery. http://jquery.com/ - "download button" under "Grab the latest version"... It just dumps the .js onto 1 line... I would have expected a file (from the prompt "jquery-1.7.1.min.js Production (31KB, Minified and Gzipped)"
[06:27:48] <Cork> elfrancesco: np
[06:28:22] <Cork> smudge: Content-Encoding	gzip
[06:28:26] <Cork> it is gziped
[06:29:51] <smudge> hey Cork... Aha, now I get it.. Now I clicked on the "uncompressed" version and I see something that looks more familiar - sorry for the time waste :-(
[06:30:15] <Cork> smudge :)
[06:30:22] <Xotix> How can i access the dragged item?
[06:30:28] <Cork> minimized means they remove linebreaks and so on
[06:30:41] <Cork> Xotix: you should have an event when you drag element
[06:31:25] <smudge> Thanks Cork .. appreciate the support... now I am off to play :)
[06:31:32] <Cork> o/
[06:31:52] <Xotix> Cork, i want to accees the thing which lies under my cursor.
[06:32:07] <Xotix> Not its parent
[06:33:05] <Cork> Xotix: the attribute should give you that
[06:33:44] <Cork> Xotix: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ > events > drag
[06:34:27] <Xotix> ah i forgot to pass the ui… thanks to you two

[06:48:15] <thesolidsnake> Anyone any ideas with this  - http://jsfiddle.net/zMBht/31/  . It works but things change even if you don't move a square
[06:48:31] <ascii`> numeric id -> position in the array or object
[06:48:35] <Pumi> gives me this error : XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=536151&u=c&callback=?. Origin http://10.0.1.19 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[06:48:50] <aqeel> use each() to iterate individually ascii
[06:49:37] <ascii`> aqeel, thanks, have i to iterate on the parent to get my position?
[06:50:01] <aqeel> can see my page.....jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html

[06:51:35] <dannN> Hi. I'm new to jquery. i try to use jquery with mootools. The Contaolove.js file works perfect, but in the CvUserInterface i can't use Contaolove.showBox(); http://pastebin.com/N2VxdQ9y
[06:51:58] <aqeel> escape $ with noconflict
[06:51:58] <joedj> Pumi: specify dataType: 'jsonp'
[06:52:18] <Pumi> that link outputs an xml file
[06:52:30] <Pumi> and if i specify it as json it gives me another error
[06:52:35] <aqeel> 2 js libraries will conflict.....dannN
[06:52:51] <Pumi> but ill see if yahoo weather api, supports json format output
[06:52:54] <Xotix> aqeel can't f ind such a slide but i also can't find any options list...
[06:53:03] <dannN> aqeel: but there are a few tutorials which works with 2 libraries
[06:53:03] <Cork> Pumi: you can't load xml cross domain
[06:53:04] <aqeel> wait...
[06:53:15] <creati29> hi again guys, this is a paste of me trying to create a generic ajax call that I can pass parameters to so that I only actually need to write the ajax call once, but for some reason the callback function won't fire, can anyone please tell me why? > http://jsfiddle.net/ABsna/
[06:53:20] <Pumi> oh
[06:53:23] <Pumi> didnt knew that
[06:54:51] <Cork> Pumi: you can't normally load anything from script cross domain
[06:55:10] <Xotix> creati29:  maybe pass the obj through the function?
[06:55:15] <Cork> Pumi: thats why there is jsonp, as it works around it through loading a <script> tag
[06:56:02] <Pumi> ok let me check yahoo api
[06:56:29] <Pumi> im sure it can output the data as json
[06:56:48] <dannN> aqeel: so there is no solution for my problem?
[06:56:54] <Cork> Pumi: doens't help
[06:56:59] <Cork> Pumi: it needs to be jsonp
[06:57:12] <aqeel> dannN use noconflict for jquery
[06:57:22] <Pumi> ok they should support jsonp then
[06:57:22] <Xotix> where do i find the options list for each effect?
[06:57:34] <dannN> aqeel: i do. jquery.noConflict.js
[06:57:49] <dannN> aqeel: Hi. I'm new to jquery. i try to use jquery with mootools. The Contaolove.js file works perfect, but in the CvUserInterface i can't use Contaolove.showBox(); http://pastebin.com/N2VxdQ9y
[06:57:53] <creati29> Xotix: how do you mean sorry?
[06:58:57] <microhxo> I am unfamiliar with adding a watch for $('.check_div'), i was told this would be a probable solution. Could anyone point me in the right direction for making watchfor?
[06:59:13] <Xotix> creati29: if you do console.log("test"); within the success event, does it get  triggered? Also, you might want to do var $success = function(obj) { console.log(obj); };
[06:59:36] <Cork> microhxo: what do you mean with a watchfor?
[06:59:44] <faithlove> hi guys. how can i select this in jquery? <td aria-describedby="grid_Record">

[07:05:48] <Xotix> aqeel:  trying
[07:06:02] <aqeel> eas it helpful??
[07:06:10] <aqeel> was*
[07:06:16] <Xotix> creati29: does the post get fired at all? does it return anything? php error? json ?
[07:06:21] <faithlove> if i have an <td aria-describedby="grid_Record"><a href="...">demo</a> </td> would $('td[aria-describedby="grid_Record"] a') work ?
[07:06:33] <aqeel> hope so what u looking for is covered in it
[07:06:34] <SoulRaven> anyone ho worked with dataTables plugin, how i get a value from a row that is hidden, when i make a live event
[07:06:58] <Adamantus> When I do this: <select name="p_id"></select> var options = $("#p_id"); options.empty(); It says options = undefined. Code is quite lengthy but will post if requred.
[07:07:03] <Adamantus> required*
[07:07:16] <Xotix> aqeel:  yeah, i think i got it.
[07:07:33] <Adamantus> sorry it says, id="p_id" on select as well
[07:07:58] <aqeel> gr8
[07:08:01] <Cork> Adamantus: it shouldn't be undefined anyway
[07:08:09] <crashev> hello I have <form id="formid"><inpu type="text" name="a"/><input type="text" name="b"/></form> why $('#formid > input').remove() does not remove input elements from it ?
[07:08:13] <Cork> Adamantus: $() always return a jquery object
[07:08:29] <Xotix> creati29: you now firebug, dev toolbars etc?
[07:08:45] <Vorspire> doesn't that means options is undefinied/does not exist in the scope of console.log's call?
[07:09:10] <Adamantus> Cork: So why will an object pointing to the select element with .empty() return undefined?
[07:09:19] <Adamantus> I think I'll post 2mins.
[07:10:10] <Cork> crashev: change inpu to input :)
[07:10:28] <BillCriswell> "inpu" sounds cute.

[07:27:42] <aqeel> This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.       <p>Sorry, nothing found for animate({http://www.learningjquery.com/wp-content/themes/ljq/docs-1.7.php?fn=width:</p>
[07:28:00] <aqeel> xotix...i got error
[07:28:48] <Xotix> aqeel: got it working, but if i use $('#elementsContainer').animate({width: 'toggle'}); can i somehow defined how it should start? "hidden" or not "hidden"?
[07:29:15] <aqeel> yes you can
[07:32:12] <aqeel> make use of fade()
[07:32:20] <creati29> xotix: sorry about the long reply, yeah the ajax call fires correctly, I can even see the correct response in the post tab in console, just the success function not firing
[07:32:51] <Rushing> anyone had issues with html5 elements in IE7/8 even with the html5 shiv?
[07:32:52] <Xotix> aqeel thanks seems to work properly. :)
[07:33:21] <aqeel> u r welcome
[07:34:06] <Cork> Rushing: you need some hack for ie < 9
[07:34:20] <Xotix> creati29: hmm, it should work if you do success: $yourFunc, if success event does get triggered of course.
[07:34:41] <Rushing> Cork: that's what the html5shiv is for
[07:34:51] <D4> What's the easiest way to accomplish a "position: fixed" after scrolling Xpx Y-wise ;p
[07:34:51] <Rushing> using modernizr, actually
[07:34:51] <Rushing> y
[07:35:04] <Cork> Rushing: whats your problem then?
[07:35:53] <Rushing> still seems like IE7/8 doesn't like those elements. doesn't want to style them or select them in the dom all the time
[07:36:31] <Rushing> works perfectly in Chrome/FF, so i know my css selectors and all are correct
[07:36:44] <Cork> Rushing: that is the document.createElement() hack
[07:36:54] <Cork> Rushing: your sure thouse fixes runs that?
[07:37:19] <microhxo> Is there anyway to expand the clickable area of a checkbox?
[07:37:41] <creati29> is it because im essentially doing success: function(){ myFunction() } ?
[07:38:54] <DerekPioneer> how do i get ui's draggable() to recognize when it's just being clicked and when it's just being dragged? http://jsfiddle.net/6Rtw8/
[07:39:19] <Rushing> Cork, modernizer is in the page and applying its styles to the html tag, so i have no reason to believe it's not running correctly
[07:39:34] <Cork> Rushing: css isn't enough
[07:39:47] <Cork> Rushing: this is needed for ie<9 http://jsfiddle.net/5M6pD/
[07:40:49] <Rushing> i know. that's the html5shiv and included with modernizer. i'm saying i have that in place and it's not working, and i also have my css declaring respective html5 elements with display:block
[07:41:09] <Cork> thats all thats needed
[07:41:29] <Rushing> i have seen this before on a site, where a majority of them worked fine, but when i started working with the elements dynamically, it wouldn't even select some of the html5 elements sometimes
[07:41:37] <Rushing> so i just went back to divs

[07:46:04] <Xotix> Does .animate({width: 'toggle'}); just affect the width?
[07:46:55] <Cork> Xotix: yes
[07:46:59] <aqeel> looks like yes no other change
[07:48:55] <Xotix> so, if you have a div, position: absolute with some draggable li's. On start: (of the draggable) ou hide the container. then the dragged item also gets hidden. You can now get it an set e.g. display: block; or visibility: visible; to see it again althought the container is hidden. But now i hide the contaienr with animate(), how can i achieve the same with this?

[07:53:17] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/DTJzE/2/ <-- examples explain pretty much what i'm attempting :)
[07:53:20] <Xotix> it's connected to a sortable,

[07:54:12] <aqeel> nice going Xotix
[07:54:43] <starsinmypockets> What's a good way to set a variable when an element is being hovered...

[07:55:37] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/DTJzE/3/ <-- updated. any help would be awesome.
[07:55:40] <aqeel> set an variable?
[07:55:52] <Xotix> aqeel: there is no too complexity ;) there is just no background knowledge.
[07:56:08] <aqeel> ok Xotix...
[07:56:18] <starsinmypockets> like, on mousenter, var hover = 1, on mouseleave var hover = 0
[07:56:33] <starsinmypockets> maybe that's the best way?
[07:56:41] <aqeel> y use var simply make use of addClass...removeClasss
[07:56:54] <starsinmypockets> no, it's to fire a function
[07:57:07] <aqeel> then simply put the function???
[07:57:25] <aqeel> hover(function on over,function on out)

[07:58:54] <microhxo> Is there anyway to make the clickable area of a checkbox bigger?????
[07:59:05] <aqeel> use css
[07:59:09] <D4> What am I doing wrong ? I think I might not be able to use show but perhaps animate but I'm not sure :: .css({'position':'fixed', 'top':'0'}, function() { $(this).show('slow') } );
[07:59:26] <microhxo> aqeel, i just want the clickable area to be larger, not the checkbox it self.
[07:59:38] <microhxo> also i've been told that many browsers ignore styling of checkboxes.
[08:00:12] <D4> I'm trying to apply position fixed with top 0 but when doing so, animate this
[08:00:29] <aqeel> quie true...but what u mean by area and not checkbox itself?
[08:00:47] <microhxo> http://www.2shared.com/photo/9gDormke/checked.html
[08:00:56] <Aidanie> How would I get a h3 with a particular attribute? i.e <h3 index='0'> Greetings </h3>
[08:01:01] <microhxo> users try to click the checkbox but often miss it and end up expanding the row accidentally.
[08:02:00] <VioByte> i guess my issue is out of the scoope of the channel.
[08:02:05] <aqeel> set the width and height explicitly...
[08:02:15] <aqeel> that might resolve your out of cli8ck issue
[08:03:10] <Xotix> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/2/ it is stil la bit buggy but doesn't matter. If you drag a number around. it disappears. How can i stop doing it? I don't how t get's hidden by Jquery.
[08:03:34] <aqeel> and for expanding when hover over the divider will only expand or reduce the column
[08:04:25] <asher^> hmm, how do i capture a click on any radio button? what im doing isnt working

[08:05:50] <D4> How'd I do .css() with .animate()? Trying to do position: fixed; top: 0; but with animation effect 'slow'. Tried a couple of different approaches like .animate({'position':'fixed', 'top':'0'}, 'slow'); and .css({}, function(){ $(this).animate() }); <-- what am I doing wrong? :)
[08:05:51] <aqeel> Xotix if u drag and release it goes back to its original position
[08:06:21] <aqeel> what are u trying to achieve exactly
[08:07:40] <CharlieM751> is it legal to do something like: jQuery(this + ' :selected')
[08:07:46] <CharlieM751> or is that not going to work out
[08:08:04] <aqeel> not work out
[08:08:13] <CharlieM751> how can I achieve the desired result?
[08:08:25] <aqeel> use each
[08:08:42] <aqeel> it will iterate and giver condition for selected...
[08:09:47] <nFFF> VioByte, whats the iussue?
[08:10:11] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/DTJzE/4/
[08:10:25] <nFFF> try including jQuery for first, and second what are you trying to actually attempt ?
[08:10:34] <Xotix> aqeel: if you drag a number around. at some point, the container gets hidden and also the item you were dragging. But actually, you are stil ldragging it. It just is hidden because its parent is hidden. You can now get it on start: or drag: and change it's css or whatever so it is shown. But i don't know how animate() works. What does animate set to get my container hidden? I need to know that to make my dragged element visible
[08:12:01] <nFFF> Xotix, perhaps just hide all siublings
[08:12:05] <nFFF> rather than the parent
[08:12:36] <CharlieM751> jQuery(this).find(':selected').html() seems to do the trick
[08:12:41] <CharlieM751> for my situation
[08:12:45] <CharlieM751> no need for the each
[08:13:28] <nFFF> Xotix, something like $('.parent ul').not($(this));
[08:13:36] <aqeel> xotix...
[08:13:48] <aqeel> click hold for a while and then drag....it will not DISAPPAER
[08:13:59] <nFFF> or siblings() mnethod
[08:14:10] <aqeel> if u cli8ck and drag too fast will disappaer..
[08:16:59] <Xotix> aqeel: i want to achieve this http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/4/ but with such a style as i get with toggle.
[08:17:20] <SoulRaven> anyone ho worked with dataTables plugin, how i get a value from a row that is hidden, when i make a live event
[08:17:53] <Xotix> here I'm just using css, visibility. i setting the parent ( the container) hidden and my dragged item to visible. I can't to this with toggle, since i don't know what get's changed with toggle.
[08:18:54] <aqeel> toggle....uses add/remove.....or remove.......or add.......well 4 options
[08:19:08] <aqeel> why not use click
[08:19:18] <aqeel> while clikc and drag
[08:19:27] <aqeel> click is relase do the event
[08:20:04] <Xotix> aqeel i meant this: $('#elementsContainer').animate({width: 'toggle'}); i've tried setting the width back for the dragged item, doesn't work.
[08:27:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: ?
[08:29:41] <nFFF> Xotix
[08:29:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/6/
[08:33:55] <Xotix> nFFF: the container still gets shown, he's just jumping around. This is how it should be, but with a nice toggled animation. http://jsfiddle.net/HuEGa/7/
[08:34:19] <fRAiLtY-> Guys, here: http://pastie.org/3578283 I have an ajax script that calls ajax.php for the script, however I'm working within Magento and this external request loses all the classes from within Magento. Is there a different way of going about this so's not to lose all the classes and load it from within the page so to speak?
[08:35:27] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: you can setup the mage app inside your ajax.php using Mage::app() and Mage::run()
[08:35:30] <johnkpaul> but you should ask this in #magento
[08:35:37] <johnkpaul> because I hate that I know the answer to that ;)
[08:37:23] <fRAiLtY-> johnkpaul: can i PM?
[08:37:35] <fRAiLtY-> Just if you know the answer... :D
[08:37:43] <johnkpaul> :) ask in #magento
[08:37:48] <johnkpaul> I'll talk to you there
[08:38:35] <creati29> if im adding a large chunk of html to a document with jq, is it better to concatenate a string or to create the html and insert into the dom on the fly?
[08:39:05] <aqeel> fly....
[08:39:31] <aqeel> but i refer use another html page and load into the container
[08:39:54] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[08:40:00] <johnkpaul> creati29: it's really whichever is easier for you, just make sure that you only modify the dom once
[08:40:15] <johnkpaul> if you can leave out concatenating long strings in js, it will be much easier
[08:40:18] <aqeel> see source no content there yet you hover over and by default the text is there
[08:40:34] <crazydiamond> Hi. How must I change 3rd line to do both vars work separately? http://dpaste.org/UEQwH/ I want 5th line to alert 15
[08:41:35] <creati29> string concatenation is easier for me but thats more down to a lack of understanding of dynamically creating markup
[08:41:54] <johnkpaul> creati29: jquery doesn't have anything to make that easier OOTB, perhaps look into jquery-tmpl which is a plugin
[08:42:11] <johnkpaul> or another templating library liek mustachejs or handlebars or one of the million others
[08:42:33] <creati29> i'll give them a look, thanks
[08:43:12] <Hawkee> I'm overriding the autocomplete source function and I'm trying to figure out how to reference ths object, $(this) or this don't work
[08:43:42] <johnkpaul> crazydiamond: you want deep copy?
[08:44:16] <asher^> does jqueryui have a 'blank' icon?
[08:44:21] <creati29> you have a paste hawkee?
[08:44:32] <aqeel> data1 = {"a":15, "b" : 10} alert(data1.a) // 15 data2 = data1 data1.b = 20 alert(data2.a) // 20
[08:44:34] <Hawkee> sure, hang on
[08:44:56] <crazydiamond> johnkapul: my object is only array/dict like thing
[08:45:34] <aqeel> after swiucthing u must specify 2.a and not 2.b
[08:45:41] <aqeel> switching*
[08:46:29] <aqeel> crazydiamond............http://jsfiddle.net/tWFkY/
[08:46:53] <Hawkee> creati29, http://pastebin.com/Evb6rx3Z
[08:47:00] <Hawkee> the cursorPos is always 0
[08:47:09] <Hawkee> and I have checked this function, it works
[08:47:44] <polerin> I don't have a publicly accessable page for this atm, but does anyone have a starting place for why a radio button set would require two clicks?
[08:47:45] <aqeel> crazydiamond...............http://jsfiddle.net/tWFkY/1/
[08:48:31] <crazydiamond> hmm... yes
[08:48:49] <crazydiamond> but data2's b changes
[08:49:03] <johnkpaul> crazydiamond: I think you want deep copy
[08:49:25] <aqeel> no never
[08:49:29] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/ @ crazydiamond
[08:49:36] <aqeel> data2 = data1
[08:49:51] <crazydiamond> johnkapul: thanks, I'll check it out
[08:49:51] <polerin> rephrase, it occasionally requires two clicks to activate a button the first time, every following click registers correctly
[08:50:05] <aqeel> this implies data 2 as data 1 and thus data 2b is never touvhed
[08:50:15] <aqeel> touched*
[08:50:38] <johnkpaul> ?eval obj1={"hello":"world"};obj2 = obj1;obj2.hello = "aqeel";obj1.hello;
[08:50:42] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "aqeel"
[08:51:38] <Hawkee> if I use document.getElementById it works fine
[08:51:57] <Hawkee> there has to be a way to pass the calling object to a function
[08:52:29] <blurryEars> got a question for you guys... my client uses IE7 and I'm experiencing some problems using the .load function... IE7 keeps complaining that unsecure data may be pulled .. .(you that stupid message you get when something on the page is using http on a https page).
[08:52:48] <blurryEars> However everything is over https.... any ideas what can be causing this... I'm using the latest version of jquery
[08:52:54] <aqeel> u see...data2=data1......=> and when u say data1.b = 20 this automagically says......data2.b is ALSO 20
[08:53:33] <johnkpaul> aqeel: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass
[08:54:12] <microhxo> Is there anyway to make the clickable area of a checkbox bigger?????
[08:54:25] <Hawkee> how do I convert $(this) to a normal document object?
[08:54:34] <Hawkee> I need to pass it to an external function
[08:54:43] <Whirl3d> $(this)[0]
[08:55:07] <Hawkee> Whirl3d, that's what I thought.  I must be doing something wrong here.
[08:55:42] <aqeel> jhonkpaul that is true as u see the PLACING of variables....
[08:55:45] <Whirl3d> console.log($(this), $(this)[0])
[08:55:49] <Hawkee> I've got a textarea with autocomplete and I'm overriding the source function
[08:56:01] <Hawkee> but when I reference $(this) it doesn't seem to refer to the textarea
[08:56:20] <Hawkee> I'm guessing I need to do something with parent possibly
[08:56:59] <Whirl3d> Often, autocomplete features are done by wrapping the input/textarea element in an object that manages input.
[08:57:25] <ajpiano> uhhhh
[08:57:26] <bot-t> (11 hours 10 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell ajpiano WORLDS COLLIDING wat http://miketaylr.com/post/6e771a2f.png
[08:57:31] <Hawkee> yes that's apparently what's happening
[08:57:34] <ajpiano> use 'this' not $(this)[0]
[08:57:43] <Carlitta87> hey guys, I'm trying to implement a button in my jquery slide show. its a very simple one but i want to implement only a next button so that images can rotate as the user clicks the button... how do i go about this?
[08:57:45] <Hawkee> I just did your console log and $(this) is the function, not the object
[08:58:07] <Whirl3d> do what ajpiano says. He won't steer you wrong.
[08:58:45] <ajpiano> not germane to the problem, just shouting down crazy when i see it
[08:58:48] <ajpiano> :p
[09:00:52] <blurryEars> any idea on what could cause IE7 to throw an insecure data prompt when using the load method (when all data is over https)?
[09:02:08] <Hawkee> ajpiano, I did this console.log(this, document.getElementById('post2')); and "this" is an object while getElementById shows me the html of the element
[09:02:12] <Hawkee> the latter works for my function
[09:03:12] <Hawkee> I'm overriding by the source and select methods of autocomplete and "this" is different for both
[09:03:16] <ajpiano>  Hawkee i have no context to make sense of that problem,
[09:03:27] <Hawkee> I have a pastebin, hang on
[09:03:34] <Hawkee> http://pastebin.com/Evb6rx3Z
[09:03:44] <tankbuggie> Hi guys, could you take a loot at this? I want to sort my tables using Tinysort, however, it's not that easy when the text im sorting on are value attributes of Inputs that are in each row of the table. http://jsfiddle.net/Bazkt/   The trick is to modify the second "tsort()" parameter I think, but I can't get it to work properly. Please take a look, thanks!
[09:04:05] <ajpiano> Hawkee: 'this' there is the autocomplet widget instance itself
[09:04:41] <Hawkee> okay, so how can I accomplish document.getElementById('post2') without referring to the object ID?
[09:05:05] <Hawkee> "this" does work for the "select" method of autocomplete
[09:05:23] <Hawkee> so there's a difference between select and source
[09:06:56] <ajpiano> Hawkee: something like this will work likely http://pastebin.com/KtPepAjM
[09:09:08] <burg> hello. as i understand, if i have a jquery ui widget called jqwidget, i can call its functions with $('elem').jqwidget("aFunction") , right? but what do i do if i need to pass a parameter to aFunction?
[09:09:42] <ajpiano> you can just do jqwidget("someFunc","some", "argz") etc
[09:11:19] <Hawkee> ajpiano, I tried your suggestion and that doesn't quite do it although it's closer
[09:11:32] <Hawkee> the console is showing the <textarea tag and not [Object] anymore
[09:11:45] <burg> ajpiano, thank you
[09:12:25] <ajpiano> Hawkee: not that this is the problem, but the fact that results is a global variable probably ain't helping
[09:12:58] <Hawkee> ajpiano, actually I removed that.. I'm handling the results differently now
[09:13:15] <ajpiano> k well you clipped the func in the middle in your paste so i have no idea
[09:13:41] <zolek> Hi, I want to use $('sth').children().hasClass('active').next().toggle() - basically to toggle the next element of those that have the 'active' class but that doesnt work
[09:13:52] <ajpiano> ?next2 @ zolek
[09:13:53] <bot-t> zolek, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[09:14:37] <Hawkee> ajpiano, I'll make a jsfiddle
[09:15:34] <Hawkee> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/tHwVf/
[09:15:52] <Hawkee> this is the working example using getElementById
[09:16:15] <Hawkee> now switch getCaret(document.getElementById('post2')); to use "status_update"
[09:16:16] <ajpiano> define woring
[09:16:24] <Hawkee> and the cursor position will always show 0
[09:16:35] <Hawkee> working in that it shows the cursor position in the testing div
[09:16:42] <ajpiano> Hawkee: i don't think autocomplete even works on a textarea
[09:16:48] <Hawkee> yes it does
[09:16:49] <DeeTah> http://wklej.org/id/707814/ - why doesn't it call the alert() even though it does a request?
[09:17:06] <Hawkee> and autocomplete will work in a contenteditable div when UI 1.9 is released
[09:17:37] <ajpiano> Hawkee: you'd have to use status_update[0]
[09:17:40] <sweb> i want to add new row as JSON data to jqGrid
[09:17:44] <sweb> any one do this ?
[09:17:51] <ajpiano> Hawkee: or make your getCaret method know how to deal with a jquery object as input
[09:17:57] <aqeel> http://yepnopejs.com/...................is this a good choice???

[09:18:58] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: !$(".foo").hasClass("bar")
[09:19:03] <ajpiano> aqeel: .has("class") is not even right
[09:19:15] <aqeel> ???
[09:19:21] <ajpiano> ?has
[09:19:22] <caniuse> ajpiano: callbacks.has(): Determine whether a supplied callback is in a list http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.has/

[09:19:48] <DeeTah> i called $.ajax(), it reads the url, but doesn't call success even though server returns 200. why might be that?
[09:19:49] <ajpiano> "Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element."
[09:19:51] <aqeel> does this not check if there is class element?
[09:19:53] <DeeTah> http://wklej.org/id/707814/
[09:20:00] <Hawkee> fris, you use the site?
[09:20:02] <ajpiano> aqeel: there's no such thing as a "class element"
[09:20:10] <aqeel> or attr('class')
[09:20:29] <ajpiano> aqeel: .has() checks for descendant elements. hasClass and .is check if something has a class or generally matches a selector
[09:20:30] <aqeel> no i mean to see if class is specified or not
[09:20:43] <aqeel> say#
[09:20:48] <karstenk1977_> I need a selector which select all elements of class item without class quote
[09:21:00] <ajpiano> aqeel: you use .hasClass("foo") or .is(".foo") for that
[09:21:21] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: $(".foo:not(.quote)")
[09:22:02] <aqeel> why attr("id") checks for id then?
[09:22:26] <karstenk1977_> jQuery('.item').not('.quote').each(function(n) {};
[09:22:32] <karstenk1977_> that it´s
[09:22:33] <ajpiano> aqeel: returning the value of something is differnt than checking whether something exists
[09:23:12] <aqeel> so if nothing is avalable it will not check is true that class is absent?
[09:23:54] <ajpiano> i don't even know what you're saying anymore
[09:24:13] <ajpiano> aqeel: play around with it in jsbin or jsfiddle or your console and you'll understand
[09:25:47] <DeeTah> anyone here farmiliar with jquery ajax?
[09:26:57] <aqeel> well i could be wrong here .just making logic if possible...
[09:27:13] <asher^> while going through .children is there a way i can get the position/index of each particular child?
[09:27:21] <aqeel> yes
[09:27:49] <asher^> how would i go about that?
[09:28:19] <aqeel> each().......iterates over every child specified in its container
[09:28:33] <Carlitta87> I was able to implement my jquery button but i think its kinda freaking out... firstunionconnect.jamaica876.com/home how can i stop this?

[09:29:43] <asher^> ajpiano thanks!
[09:30:23] <DeeTah> http://wklej.org/id/707814/ - any ideas why doesn't this code work, even though the request is called, and 200 is returned?

[09:33:17] <ajpiano> karstenk1977_: you could probably google this #js
[09:33:29] <AdvoWork> If i'm doing: var row = $(this).closest("tr").get(0);  and then row basically contains the html of that row, how can I get the contents of cell 9 from that row?
[09:33:33] <Hawkee> I'm surprised there hasn't been a solid solution to this released
[09:33:52] <ajpiano> Hawkee: i've definitely seen one before
[09:34:04] <ajpiano> can't remember where but you aren't the first person i've seen doing it
[09:34:20] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: it doesn't "basically contain the html for that row" it has a TR element
[09:34:33] <ajpiano> TR.children().eq(8) would be the 9th td
[09:34:43] <ajpiano> row.children().eq(8) etc
[09:35:31] <AdvoWork> ahh, thanks
[09:37:07] <SoulRaven> using selector, how i select table tag, when i have only the tr td element
[09:37:27] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, im doing: var row = $(this).closest("tr").get(0); and then tried: console.log(row.children().eq(9));  but it says: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLTableRowElement> is not a function  does this mean my row definition is incorrect or something?
[09:37:45] <ajpiano> why are you doing .get(0)
[09:38:10] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: AdvoWork $(row).children().eq(8)
[09:38:12] <AdvoWork> just saw it on an example to be honest and it appeared to work, maybe incorrectly then
[09:38:17] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: 8 will be the ninth
[09:38:21] <ajpiano> it's 0 indexed
[09:39:37] <AdvoWork> got ya, it returns the column now: <td class="editable_unit_price" title="">67</td>  but not the value, whats the best way to get this, just .html() ?
[09:39:56] <ajpiano> yep
[09:39:58] <ribot> hi
[09:40:43] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, and what about setting the contents of the column for that row, same process?
[09:40:51] <ajpiano> yes\

[09:44:57] <aqeel> good night tw2113......midnight here
[09:47:09] <burg> in a sortable (jquery ui), how can i also register click event for sortable items, but only trigger it if there is no drag
[09:47:16] <Hawkee> ajpiano, I found a handful of them but they each had flaws
[09:47:54] <ajpiano> burg: set the 'distance' option on sortable to a higher number than 1
[09:48:04] <ajpiano> that way 'dragging' won't be triggered until they move the mouse a little bit
[09:48:09] <ajpiano> and then you can have normal click events as well
[09:50:09] <burg> ajpiano, i also want click not to be triggered if i only want to sort the items
[09:50:21] <burg> using your method, i believe click will be triggered all the time
[09:50:44] <ajpiano> hm,
[09:50:53] <ajpiano> burg: another approach would be to use a handle element
[09:50:58] <ajpiano> instead of the whole element being sortable
[09:51:04] <TehShrike2> This question has an awful lot of "likes" and no answer: http://api.jquery.com/append/#comment-49107490
[09:51:46] <ajpiano> TehShrike2: neither of the options he asks about are accurate
[09:52:01] <ajpiano> TehShrike2: .append returns the element you had before you appended it
[09:52:30] <TehShrike|Work> ajpiano: sorry, I'm having trouble parsing that
[09:52:34] <ajpiano> $("#foo").append("<div>hi</div>") returns foo
[09:52:44] <TehShrike|Work> ajpiano: aah, thanks
[09:52:50] <peol> $('<div/>').appendTo('#foo') returns <div>
[09:53:06] <joedoe> hello
[09:53:09] <TehShrike|Work> ajpiano: I think that's what that commenter meant by "target element"
[09:53:09] <peol> (if you wondered about that as well)
[09:53:12] <TehShrike|Work> But that's just a guess
[09:53:20] <joedoe> f = function () { var hello = 5; $([1, 2, 3]).each(function(k, v) { alert(v*hello); }); }
[09:53:31] <joedoe> is it correct code? (it works of course)
[09:54:04] <joedoe> my problem is that minifiers minify first "hello" and leave second one untouched
[09:55:00] <joedoe> hm
[09:55:03] <joedoe> ignore it for a while
[09:55:04] <TehShrike|Work> ajpiano: in the case of your first example, do you know of any tricks to easily get a jQuery object for the new div that was created there, short of giving it a unique id and using a selector to find it again?
[09:55:25] <ajpiano> TehShrike|Work: var foo = $("<div>").appendTo("#bar");
[09:55:34] <TehShrike|Work> ajpiano: <3
[09:55:40] * peol is invisible
[09:55:44] <ajpiano> :p
[09:56:04] <TehShrike|Work> peol: woah hey, my bad
[09:56:19] <TehShrike|Work> peol: thanks for being psychic and telling me what I wanted to know, though I was apparently too slow to catch it
[09:56:23] <peol> heh, no worries
[09:56:27] <Whirl3d> how could this happen:   var gallery=$("#gallery"); gallery.data("series","test"); console.log(gallery.data("series");  ...returns undefined
[09:57:16] <peol> Whirl3d: no element matches #gallery
[09:57:19] <Florian_> joedoe: which minifier? Tried another?
[09:57:20] <peol> i.e. your collection is empty
[09:58:01] <Whirl3d> I swear I am retarded.
[09:58:35] <Whirl3d> Too many versions of a project and I get lost. Thanks peol.
[09:58:43] <peol> Whirl3d: you're welcome
[09:59:36] <asher^> how would i select a particular element by its index if i was using .find?
[10:00:12] <ajpiano> .find(":nth-child(9)") or .find(":eq(8)") but those could all give nested elements inside
[10:00:12] <peol> asher^: .eq(index)
[10:00:27] <peol> or what ajpiano said
[10:00:45] <TehShrike|Work> Is the general principle that jQuery functions return the jquery object that they were called on?
[10:00:50] <asher^> thanks
[10:01:03] <ajpiano> TehShrike|Work: ye
[10:01:08] <TehShrike|Work> Cool, thanks
[10:01:10] <joedoe> Florian_: forget about it
[10:01:13] <joedoe> I had typo!
[10:01:14] <joedoe> sorry
[10:01:15] <joedoe> bye
[10:02:29] <peol> TehShrike|Work: I wrote an article a few weeks ago on some basics if you're interested. http://andreehansson.se/the-basics-of-jquery/
[10:03:53] <TehShrike|Work> peol: hey, that looks like a thing I should read.  Thanks!
[10:08:01] <AdvoWork> i'm doing: var current_row = $(this).closest("tr").get(0); but how do I get the row number at all?
[10:08:21] <ajpiano> stop doing .get(0) unless you actually need a DOM element bro
[10:08:30] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("tr").index()
[10:08:36] <ajpiano> will tell you the index of the row among the other rows
[10:09:32] <AdvoWork> ahh, ok, sorry, what exactly does get(0) do? i assume get row 0? which is fail for multiple?
[10:10:19] <ajpiano> it gives you a DOM element instead of a jQuery object
[10:10:43] <AdvoWork> so just remove .get(0) basically?
[10:11:13] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: no. stop looking for magic prescriptions. understand the problem, and understand the methods
[10:11:18] <ajpiano> and figure out what is appropriate for your situation
[10:14:05] <AdvoWork> out of interest, do you know why in chrome.log  it shows output in red, but then something in blue?
[10:15:12] <dogarrhea2> hi all

[10:15:33] <dogarrhea2> how do you do it via jquery?
[10:15:45] <dogarrhea2> change background image?
[10:15:45] <asher^> why not use css?
[10:16:01] <dogarrhea2> hrm. is there a way to set the button style as none and place custom image

[10:26:23] <Ezek2k5> i have an autocomplete in a form and im trying to figure if im doingsometing wrong because i want to make the autocomplete on some input fields but this isnt working $( "#member_spouse","#membre_child_1","#membre_child_2" ).autocomplete({
[10:26:34] <Ezek2k5> is there someting wrong with my syntax or i have to make them 1 by 1
[10:26:43] <Ezek2k5> if i leave only 1 it works
[10:26:45] <ajpiano> Ezek2k5: put it all inside the same string literal when you want to select multiple elements
[10:26:54] <Ezek2k5> ah okk
[10:26:57] <ajpiano> $("#member_spouse, #member_child_1, #member_child_2")
[10:26:59] <Ezek2k5> thank you :)
[10:27:03] <ajpiano> alternatively give them all a class
[10:27:10] <Ezek2k5> i c
[10:27:14] <Ezek2k5> ty very much
[10:29:28] <dogarrhea2> what kind of library would I use to produce an oscillating effect animation?
[10:29:55] <dogarrhea2> the kind of effect you'd see on an oscilloscope
[10:31:04] <peol> ?g oscilloscope jquery plugin
[10:31:06] <bot-t> peol, need an oscilloscope plugin - Gearslutz.com - http://www.gearslutz.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-electronic-music-production/390729-need-oscilloscope-plugin.html
[10:31:26] <TehShrike|Work> What is the correct way to test to see if a jQuery object is empty (as in, my selector found no matches)?  Is it .length?
[10:31:43] <peol> TehShrike|Work: yeah
[10:31:46] <jita> I have a class of divisions which contain the numeric value, I want to find out the maximum of all the divisions of a class, how can i do that ?

[10:33:56] <Hawkee> I tried this: var status_update = $('#post'); status_update.data('id_map', new Array());

[10:37:44] <magic_hat> Hi everyone. I'm trying to implement a jquery autocomplete where selecting one of the returned items directs the user to a new link. I'm having trouble accessing properties of the selected item: http://pastie.org/3579063 Line #5. Anyone know how to do this?
[10:37:46] <erichynds> jita: .get() before reversing
[10:38:07] <magic_hat> I've also tried $(this).photo_id, which is undefined.
[10:38:10] <erichynds> or .last()[0]
[10:39:02] <peol> erichynds: jita: $('.foo').map(function() { return +this.innerHTML; }).sort(function(a,b) { return a < b; })[0]
[10:39:12] <peol> erichynds: .map() returns an array
[10:39:23] <erichynds> peol: it returns a jQuery object
[10:39:49] <erichynds> sort() just happens to be on the jQuery prototype
[10:40:17] <peol> erichynds: hah, rightt, my bad
[10:40:38] <creati29> has anyone ever experienced firebug suddenly saying that there are no javascripts on the page even though there are?
[10:40:57] <creati29> and if i view source and click on the link to the script i can see the script source
[10:42:16] <jita> thanks peol, erichynds
[10:42:23] <peol> .uglify $('.foo').map(function() { return +this.innerHTML; }).sort(function(a,b) { return a < b; })[0]
[10:42:23] <socialhapy> ★ $(".foo").map(function(){return+this.innerHTML}).sort(function(a,b){return a<b})[0]
[10:42:31] <peol> heh, guess it couldn't do better
[10:42:35] <peol> jita: np
[10:43:15] <bitwise_> isnt a < b the default sort?
[10:43:42] <ag4ve> i need to deviate from the base autocomplete (or possibly a bug?) here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:44:34] <peol> bitwise_: probably :p
[10:45:00] <ag4ve> it seems that if i enter a search, click away, double click on what i typed (so that the value clears or thing.val('') in my case) and then try to type the same thing again, it doesn't trigger the data method again
[10:45:31] <bitwise_> its a little more complicated: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[10:46:53] <ParanoidGal> Can I use slideDown() and slideDown() to make a div open on clicking but then be hidden again when next div is clicked on?
[10:46:53] <peol> bitwise_: guess return b-a should be the correct one here. cc jita
[10:49:09] <ag4ve> ParanoidGal: i'd just do a slideUp() (or whatever) an all other elements when (right before) you slide the other option down.
[10:50:10] <warrenparsons> ag4ve: That could give an undesirable result. I believe slideUp() on a hidden element will Show -> SlideUp that element.
[10:51:52] <bitwise_> peol also is +el.innerHTML as reliable as parseInt(el.innerHTML ,10)?
[10:52:12] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: You could do $('mainElement').on('click', function(){ $(this).slideDown(); $('.otherElements:visible').slideUp(); ); );
[10:52:19] <peol> bitwise_: yes, but it's slower. parseFloat performs best afaik.
[10:54:07] <peol> bitwise_: shouldn't really matter here, unless he has a lot of elements, which would be slow any way… but here's a test i did recently. https://twitter.com/#!/peolanha/status/178433010209796097

[10:54:22] <ChuckieChan> trying to prevent form submit. my code: $("input[type='submit']").click(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[10:54:26] <AdvoWork> Don't suppose anyone knows how to hide a column in a datatables table, yet still use its value? I can hide it no problem, but then if i try and reference it, it fails as its not visible :S
[10:54:36] <ChuckieChan> i doesn't work :/
[10:54:44] <ajpiano> ChuckieChan: you prevent submit by using the submit event, not the click event on the input
[10:54:58] <ajpiano> $("form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[10:55:20] <ag4ve> warrenparsons++ $('.otherElements:visible').slideUp(); - probably need .each( function () { this.slideUp(); }; ); but something like that should work for them
[10:55:28] <warrenparsons> ag4ve: Just checked, looks like I was wraong about .slideUp
[10:55:44] <magic_hat> Anyone know how to access properties of the selected item in autocomplete? http://pastie.org/3579063 Line #5 is returning undefined.
[10:55:45] <ag4ve> either way :)
[10:55:53] <ChuckieChan> think i tried that, I could try again :)
[10:55:58] <bitwise_> peol: nice, good to know. also, this: http://twitter.com/#!/dlsspy/status/178043578457661440

[10:58:39] <Whirl3d> I need to tween a "background" (just a div in behind all the others, not the background property) over 8 seconds, but the foreground elements need to tween much quicker. Do I need to use custom animation queues or is there a better way to do this?
[10:58:53] <ag4ve> also, if you aren't too invested init, you might try doing it with the jquery template library - looks easier to use.
[10:58:55] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: Sure. There are a number of approaches to that problem.
[10:59:03] <bitwise_> peol: :)
[10:59:03] <ajpiano> ChuckieChan:  impossible to diagnose without a live demo

[11:13:13] <darkangel> When you use a rating widget, do you generally display the overall rating until the active user rates the item, and then display his/her rating from that point on, or how is it usually done?
[11:20:52] <ericincoldohio> I need to make a link that pops up another window, the new window submits login info to another site(not mine).  So in the end the user clicks a link, new window with them logged in.  The login/password isn't unique per user, its setup for our entire site to use.  Is there a best approach so the login/password doesn't get stuck in the page or in javascript?
[11:21:24] <ericincoldohio> I can't really encrypt it since the site it's submitting to doesn't decryp
[11:22:14] <ericincoldohio> and I didn't think I could do a jquery post to another site...or could I?
[11:23:15] <AdvoWork> if i'm doing: $(nRow).attr('id',iDisplayIndex ); and i've already got a class, is it best doing .attr('data-test',...  or .data('test',... ?
[11:25:17] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: what do you mean "you've already got a class"
[11:25:51] <johnkpaul> ericincoldohio: you can't jquery post to another site, no. You could submit a form to another site, but then you lose control of the page
[11:26:14] <ericincoldohio> its okay to lose control
[11:26:28] <nights> hi guys. to close a modal i have to press <a class="close" data-dismiss="modal">.  how can i close it by jquery?
[11:26:38] <nights> on pageready
[11:26:56] <ericincoldohio> I guess I need to make an in between page that just holds the form...
[11:27:11] <warrenparsons> nights: If you don't have direct access to the JS to modify it, you can use $('.close').trigger('click');
[11:27:28] <johnkpaul> ericincoldohio: then you can use a regular form, no js required
[11:27:48] <nights> warrenparsons: thats very useful. let me try that. i actually have access to the JS though.. this is a twitter bootstrap modal
[11:28:13] <ericincoldohio> cool...was trying to it all in one click, back to original plan, thanks
[11:28:42] <warrenparsons> nights: Ideally you'd have direct access to the close method that you could activate as a function call. .trigger() works in a pinch to fire an event.
[11:28:48] <johnkpaul> np ericincoldohio, have fun
[11:29:23] <nights> warrenparsons: hm, thanks. though the modal could be clicked in many ways, essentially i want the click on the background which closes it. does your method warrent this?
[11:29:27] <Carlitta87> is it possible t use jquery expander so that every 500 words then it coudl expand?
[11:30:09] <nights> warrenparsons: essentially i will return this from a dynamic page and it will be executed in the ajax functions success by using eval on the returned code.
[11:30:23] <warrenparsons> nights: It should. All .trigger() does is fire an event programatically, rather than physically. In other words .trigger('click') does the same as physically clicking on the element, without the actual mouse click happening.
[11:30:46] <warrenparsons> ?trigger
[11:30:46] <caniuse> warrenparsons: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/

[11:31:34] <nights> ah
[11:31:41] <nights> warrenparsons: but how do i know where the click will happen?
[11:31:45] <nights> i dont want it to submit anytihng
[11:31:57] <nights> some area of the modal will trigger another ajax page
[11:32:16] <nights> wow
[11:32:17] <nights> it worked
[11:32:23] <nights> i tried in firebug JS console
[11:32:41] <nights> great
[11:32:42] <nights> :)
[11:32:45] <nights> probably im fine then
[11:32:50] <nights> this was more than i expected
[11:33:02] <nights> is that .close some general class?
[11:33:06] <nights> magic to me how this can work
[11:33:08] <nights> but it does
[11:33:22] <Carlitta87> trying to use expander to slice up a paragraph by a certain length of text but i can only do 2 slices....not sure how to do dynamic slices...can anyone help?

[11:34:30] <nights> this saved my day!

[12:06:11] <RedAlert> or at the end
[12:06:23] <RedAlert> ie - 1 can result in 110 or 101
[12:06:26] <eddiemonge> then look at the value
[12:06:31] <RedAlert> depending on where they type

[12:06:58] <TehShrike|Work> melvster: I think most people just drop a minimized copy of jQuery at the top of their extension
[12:07:04] <[jasper]> hej guys, anyone here who can help me?
[12:07:08] <eddiemonge> redalert if ( bad input ) { return false; }
[12:07:17] <eddiemonge> ?ask [jasper]
[12:07:19] <bot-t> eddiemonge, jQuery.support - A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[12:07:25] <RedAlert> but the input is just 1 keypress
[12:07:55] <RedAlert> restrction is based on the result
[12:08:07] <melvster> TehShrike|Work: great thanks, we tried that ... but there's a slight complication we load an xpcom component before that that uses jquery ... was wondering if there's a standard way to get it in there too ?
[12:08:12] <[jasper]> eddiemonge I have this page <-- http://www.warfields.net/test/index.php?page=wars
[12:08:32] <[jasper]> when you press urbanterror for example...the game div should be hidden using hide
[12:08:33] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: try what i said
[12:08:43] <RedAlert> if I have the location they are trying to type to I can use a simple algorithm to figure out the result
[12:08:46] <[jasper]> that works...the div gets hidden..but for some reason the rest slides up weirdly
[12:08:47] <TehShrike|Work> melvster: why not move the jQuery code to the top?
[12:08:52] <[jasper]> causing double entries in the list
[12:09:01] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: you are making it harder than it needs to be methinks
[12:09:09] <thesolidsnake> Woooo hooooo - http://thesolidsnake.comuf.com/puzzle.html  :)
[12:09:19] <melvster> TehShrike|Work:  jquery is at the top, but xpcom kind of kicks in before it starts on the xul
[12:09:29] <DerekPioneer> how do i send array-like $_POST values with ajax(). values like login['username']=asdfsadfsaf
[12:09:39] <RedAlert> edditmonge: I don't know if the input is bad or not until I can evaluate the result
[12:09:58] <DerekPioneer> i don't mean how do i send an array, i mean how do i send $_POST values that actually look like asdfsadf['asdsadfasdf']
[12:10:08] <[jasper]> eddiemonge see what i mean
[12:10:15] <RedAlert> if I want them to only type in numbers below 50, and there's currently a 4 in the box
[12:10:17] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: thats why you look at the value
[12:10:30] <RedAlert> if they type in a 7, it will be valid or invalid depending on w here they type it
[12:10:54] <RedAlert> so you are saying i have to show it in the textbox and then revert if it's invalid?
[12:11:11] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: add this to your code and start typing $('textarea').on("keydown keypress keyup", function(e){ console.log(e.type, this.value) });
[12:11:33] <RedAlert> ok
[12:13:44] <DerekPioneer> do i have to append success() data from ajax in order to read parts of it with jquery. ex: success: function(data) { var messages = $(data).filter('ul.messages') }
[12:15:12] <RedAlert> edditmonge: this.value has what's in the text box, when it's too late to restrict the input
[12:15:23] <RedAlert> eddiemonge*
[12:16:52] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: you should be getting three logs for each keypress. two should have the value with the key pressed and one should have the value without the key. do you see that?
[12:17:36] <RedAlert> yes
[12:17:53] <RedAlert> if I type a restricted character, all of the values are the same though
[12:20:01] <RedAlert> what I want to do is get the result the text field after a keypress before it is output in the textarea
[12:20:51] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: http://jsfiddle.net/vMHHn/
[12:21:41] <ncooley> @eddiemongle looks like you can't type "05" either
[12:22:17] <eddiemonge> not if 5 is in there already
[12:22:33] <ncooley> right but you're only trying to restrict "50"
[12:22:34] <RedAlert> eddiemonge: that is close, but I want to be able to type 05 if I want
[12:22:40] <eddiemonge> but this wasnt meant to be a catchall example. it was meant as a "this is what ive been trying to explain example"
[12:24:05] <RedAlert> even though 05 isnt very useful, in other cases it would be
[12:24:12] <RedAlert> 51 vs 15 for example
[12:24:31] <ncooley> @RedAlert - what are some examples of allowed vs disallowed combinations?
[12:24:44] <ncooley> and what are some combinations of default values?
[12:24:49] <ncooley> er examples
[12:25:03] <ncooley> we can certainly build on this example to get you to where you want to be
[12:25:23] <RedAlert> well
[12:25:37] <RedAlert> lets say i want a max of 24 for the input
[12:25:42] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: http://jsfiddle.net/vMHHn/1/
[12:25:44] <RedAlert> they cant type anything bigger than that
[12:26:13] <ncooley> so you want to compare the "before" value to the "after" value?
[12:26:15] <RedAlert> would be simple to restrict if I could grab the keypress location as well as the keypress charcode
[12:26:20] <LukeNukem> Hello, i have href on click runs ajax scripts
[12:26:29] <LukeNukem> href='#' makes the user scroll to the top of page after click
[12:26:38] <LukeNukem> so i need to remove #, but then the link does not work anymore
[12:26:45] <LukeNukem> i tried e.preventDefault(); but its not working
[12:26:55] <ncooley> kind of like @eddiemonge's second fiddle?
[12:27:17] <ncooley> I imagine it could get tedious to map all possible keycodes to values
[12:27:17] <RedAlert> eddiemonge: that's one way to do it, though the issue with that is fast typers will bypass your revert
[12:27:37] <RedAlert> its not
[12:27:44] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: http://jsfiddle.net/vMHHn/2/
[12:27:51] <eddiemonge> RedAlert: no they wont
[12:27:52] <warrenparsons> LukeNukem: Are you placing an "e" inside the function parentheses? $('myelement').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[12:27:59] <RedAlert> charCode - 48 = int value
[12:28:07] <LukeNukem> warrenparsons, yeah i just tried that and now it worked :>
[12:28:12] <RedAlert> i just typed in 501 quickly and it went through
[12:28:23] <RedAlert> trying to backspace after that kept replacing my 1
[12:28:46] <warrenparsons> LukeNukem: Yeah, the "e" is just shorthand for "event", but it needs something to reference. Hence the function(e){}
[12:30:34] <RedAlert> at this point it seems best to just leave it as a check on submit
[12:31:00] <ncooley> or a check onBlur()
[12:31:34] <badbandit> hello, if I have say 5 div elements with class content (eg <div class="content">), how can I select the nth one?
[12:31:47] <badbandit> all in the same containter
[12:31:49] <RedAlert> yeah that would be good as well
[12:31:49] <badbandit> *container
[12:32:07] <RedAlert> use [n]?
[12:32:13] <eddiemonge> ?eq @ badbandit
[12:32:14] <caniuse> badbandit: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/

[12:33:37] <StevenCodes22> RedAlert: ty
[12:35:41] <Itrace> How can I auto select a drop down select field in a form by passing a query string?
[12:37:27] <SashaGrey89> What's a good lightweight plugin for playing FLV videos?
[12:37:30] <gehsekky> Itrace: set the .val() of the drop down list
[12:38:04] <Itrace> gehsekky: like this: $('#myDropdown option:selected').val("foo")
[12:38:34] <silverwind> SashaGrey89, you could try adobe strobe
[12:38:37] <gehsekky> Itrace: you don't need the option:selected
[12:38:57] <gehsekky> Itrace: just $('#myDropdown').val('value');
[12:38:58] <warrenparsons> Itrace: $('#myDropdown').val(queryStringValue);
[12:39:37] <gehsekky> Itrace: you need to extract the querystring value and set the dropdownlist value in a document.ready() block
[12:40:39] <Itrace> Perfect thanks all.
[12:43:09] <Hawkee> what would be a good event to attach to a textarea to make sure every time it's updated the event gets called?
[12:43:28] <johnkpaul> Hawkee: keyup or change
[12:43:34] <johnkpaul> ?change @Hawkee
[12:43:34] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .change(): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/

[12:44:00] <Hawkee> thank you johnkpaul, those are the two I've been considering
[12:44:15] <Hawkee> will keyup not trigger when text is pasted into the textarea?
[12:44:44] <jlebrech> what's wrong with this callback? https://gist.github.com/5aab61ff19c16115b83f
[12:45:25] <johnkpaul> no, the paste event does not trigger a keyup
[12:45:55] <StevenCodes22> anyone know why this isnt working just does nothing at all http://jsfiddle.net/hhWxa/
[12:46:00] <johnkpaul> jlebrech: extra right paren
[12:47:16] <jlebrech> johnkpaul: i can count the right amount of paren, I think they're in the wrong place
[12:47:41] <XOXO1> hello. I have a bunch of draggable elements. If I do a middle click on those elements I want to change the image file of that element but it also causes every other draggable element to move up/down a bit
[12:47:45] <XOXO1> how can I fix that?
[12:48:04] <XOXO1> i suppose it has something to the with the positioning of those elements
[12:49:24] <subdesign> guys if i get json data from a php method, why i appear the json data  on top of the page?
[12:49:38] <subdesign> it*
[12:50:57] <subdesign> ok its an echo but the javascript routine calls it with get
[12:59:37] <subdesign> ok solved, i have to check if its a $_GET
[13:01:16] <tankblergh> Hi guys! Im trying to get my Tinysort to work on tables, but I can't figure out why it won't work on tables, can you guys take a look at this example? http://jsfiddle.net/Bazkt/2/
[13:01:34] <tankblergh> the point is to click the column headers to sort the rows
[13:10:36] <Mkop> I have a <select> with a few hundred elements. I am finding that .val(some_string) behavior is very slow. anyone know how to speed it up?
[13:11:13] <jedimind> yeah, dont have a few hundred elements
[13:11:14] <jedimind> :)
[13:11:23] <warrenparsons> Mkop: What jedimind said.
[13:11:24] <ravenzz> so i have this share widget, and I have an send by email link. As I can't know the recipient it is a regular link. Does this could fail? http://pastie.org/3580156
[13:12:00] <Mkop> at some point I want to replace this dropdown with a calendar widget, but for now it's a dropdown with a few years of dates
[13:12:23] <warrenparsons> Mkop: So you're putting several years worth of individual dates into a single dropdown?
[13:12:33] <Mkop> yes
[13:12:49] <warrenparsons> Mkop: That's terrible design. Split it up into Day / Month / Year dropdowns.
[13:14:06] <Mkop> for our purposes, it works. changing it will require retraining users :-(
[13:14:16] <Mkop> and reworking back-end code
[13:14:24] <Mkop> (though I guess that part is super easy)
[13:14:26] <warrenparsons> Mkop: Are you saying your users won't be able to understand how to input a simple date on a form?
[13:15:52] <Mkop> point is, I didn't come here to discuss UI design. I came with a performance question. if the answer is there's no way to do it faster without changing design, then so be it
[13:16:13] <warrenparsons> Mkop: That's pretty much the answer.
[13:16:28] <Mkop> ok, thanks. much appreciated
[13:16:41] <Mkop> could I do it in raw js?
[13:17:12] <warrenparsons> Mkop: Sure, but you'd probably end up duplicating what jQuery does internally, or making it even less performant.
[13:20:22] <Mkop> actually, this works well (for my specific use case): $(this).get(0).selectedIndex = $("#other_dropdown").get(0).selectedIndex;
[13:22:18] <blendedbychris> anyone around to point me in the right direction with this froogaloop js… i'm not sure how to setup the click event properly (it doesn't work in firefox with this code).http://pastie.textmate.org/private/yu5uwzjk59mmvuac7bmwa
[13:22:30] <timwis> Hey guys, does anyone know if this jQuery code is necessary or if it's possible to do with just CSS?
[13:22:31] <timwis> http://jsfiddle.net/A59tP/
[13:22:34] <Mkop> or more jquery-ish: $(this).prop('selectedIndex',$("#other_dropdown").prop('selectedIndex'));
[13:26:04] <johnkpaul> timwis: you can't have that logic expressed in css alone
[13:27:05] <timwis> johnkpaul c'mon, i bet georgekringo could figure it out ;)
[13:27:32] <johnkpaul> :) probably them, but not I
[13:27:46] <johnkpaul> if you're using a server side to generate your html, it should be pretty easy
[13:28:00] <johnkpaul> I don't think that you should use your javascript to hide something from users that aren't meant to see it
[13:28:27] <DerekPioneer> i've got four lines of jquery here, can't get hasclass() to respond the way i would have thought it would. http://jsfiddle.net/k8nnw/
[13:29:08] <Mkop> timwis: yes, I agree that this is something that should probably be on the server-side
[13:29:11] <ajpiano> DerekPioneer: hasClass checks if the element you currently have has a particular class
[13:29:16] <ajpiano> not whether it contains something that has that class
[13:29:22] <DerekPioneer> aw
[13:29:24] <DerekPioneer> ah*
[13:29:26] <ajpiano> DerekPioneer: you want .has(".my-account")
[13:29:39] <timwis> MKop I wish I could :/ I don't have access to filter it server side. I only have access to the front end and to change the actual content of the page
[13:30:01] <Mkop> anything hidden in javascript should be considered visible (security-wise) to everyone
[13:30:02] <ajpiano> DerekPioneer: oh wait no you don't want .has()
[13:30:26] <ajpiano> uch i'm being so confusing
[13:30:48] <DerekPioneer> ajpiano: haha, what do i want?
[13:30:54] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/k8nnw/1/
[13:31:08] <ajpiano> has reduces the set so you stil have a jquery object, not a boolean
[13:31:09] <johnkpaul> .has isn't a bool?
[13:31:20] <johnkpaul> oh wow, I'd have never guessed that
[13:31:21] <ajpiano> correct
[13:31:22] <johnkpaul> ?has
[13:31:22] <caniuse> johnkpaul: callbacks.has(): Determine whether a supplied callback is in a list http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.has/
[13:31:22] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/

[13:31:26] <ajpiano> omg
[13:31:30] <johnkpaul> :/ sorry
[13:31:34] <johnkpaul> didn't think that there'd be 4
[13:31:36] <ajpiano> lol that's not on you
[13:31:38] <ajpiano> smplstk: !!!
[13:31:42] <ajpiano> what the crap is going on
[13:31:45] <Mkop> oh my gosh, what's with these bots
[13:32:23] <ajpiano> there's a new one he is still needing some kinks worked out obvis :)
[13:32:26] <ajpiano> it's showing al the results for has
[13:32:46] <DerekPioneer> ajpiano: ty!
[13:32:50] <Mkop> seemingly that is better behavior, right? only problem is that we got four instead of three
[13:33:46] <bartmax> how can i filter a js object literal (no jQuery) using a property ?
[13:34:00] <bartmax> can I use jquery to set the object back to literal ?
[13:34:19] <johnkpaul> bartmax: what does that mean?
[13:34:33] <bartmax> have an obj with an array of items, some items have isDeleted = true
[13:34:45] <bartmax> i want to create an array with those ONLY.
[13:35:17] <johnkpaul> obj.arr.filter(function(item){return !item.isDeleted})
[13:35:26] <bartmax> var list = [{id:1,isDeleted:true}, {id:2, isDeleted:false}]
[13:35:50] <Mkop> ?grep
[13:35:50] <caniuse> Mkop: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[13:35:50] <bot-t> jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[13:35:56] <johnkpaul> ?eval var list = [{id:1,isDeleted:true}, {id:2, isDeleted:false}];list.filter(function(item){return !item.isDeleted});
[13:35:57] <bot-t> johnkpaul: [{"id": 2, "isDeleted": false}]
[13:36:13] <bartmax> nice
[13:36:39] <johnkpaul> bartmax: that might break in early IE's, but you can find a shim/shiv/whatever by googling
[13:37:03] <Mkop> ?eval var list = [{id:1,isDeleted:true}, {id:2, isDeleted:false}];$.grep(list,function() {return !this.isDeleted;});
[13:37:04] <bot-t> Mkop: [{"id": 1, "isDeleted": true}, {"id": 2, "isDeleted": false}]
[13:37:17] <Mkop> hmm, what'd I do wrong?
[13:37:36] <Mkop> oh, you can't use this, need to use item param
[13:37:37] <johnkpaul> hmm, I don't know if this is set to be the obj
[13:37:38] <microhxo> How can i make my Links appear directly to the right of my filler content? http://jsfiddle.net/QBbPU/90/
[13:37:49] <microhxo> wrong window, sry
[13:37:49] <Mkop> ?eval var list = [{id:1,isDeleted:true}, {id:2, isDeleted:false}];$.grep(list,function(item, index) {return !item.isDeleted;});
[13:37:50] <bot-t> Mkop: [{"id": 2, "isDeleted": false}]
[13:38:13] <Mkop> $.grep I believe is portable including to old IEs, right?
[13:40:41] <bartmax> thank you johnkpaul & Mkop, works like a charm, using $.grep just in case works better with IE :D
[13:40:57] <bartmax> didn't know jQuery got a GREP ... nice to learn something new :D
[13:41:04] <DerekPioneer> can i run standard jquery fn's on data returned by ajax. ex: var dataObj = $(data);   if(dataObj.find('.col-1').has('.box').length) return true
[13:41:11] <johnkpaul> no probem, yes, it will work in old IE's, I'm pretty sure that grep delegates to filter if it's available
[13:41:18] <DerekPioneer> or do i need to append to a div first
[13:41:23] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: you can if data is an html string
[13:41:44] <johnkpaul> no, it doesn't need to be appended to the dom yet
[13:42:03] <johnkpaul> ?eval $("<div class='test'></div>").hasClass("test");
[13:42:03] <bot-t> johnkpaul: TypeError: div is undefined
[13:42:17] <johnkpaul> ?eval jQuery("<div class='test'></div>").hasClass("test");
[13:42:18] <bot-t> johnkpaul: TypeError: div is undefined
[13:42:29] <johnkpaul> hmm, that's weird
[13:42:56] <Mkop> ?eval jQuery("&lt;div class='test'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;").hasClass("test");
[13:42:57] <bot-t> Mkop: false
[13:43:08] <Mkop> bot-t: who owns you?
[13:43:09] <bot-t> Mkop, Signs point to yes.
[13:43:14] <johnkpaul> haha
[13:43:20] <johnkpaul> hmm, I guess I'm wrong DerekPioneer
[13:43:25] <johnkpaul> I was pretty sure though, let me make a fiddle
[13:43:43] <Mkop> no, you can definitely do stuff without appending to the dom
[13:43:47] <Mkop> bot is being weird
[13:44:04] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[13:44:12] <johnkpaul> what's the world coming to
[13:44:15] <johnkpaul> when you can't trust your own bot
[13:44:52] <kanzie> is there any clever way to redo a ajax-call where the error:-clause is running?
[13:45:20] <kanzie> so when I do $.ajax() and get the error() I want to retry the same $.ajax() again
[13:45:52] <Mkop> johnkpaul: are you the botmaster?
[13:46:04] <johnkpaul> ha, no
[13:46:18] <Mkop> ?eval jQuery("&lt;div class=\'test\'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;").hasClass("test");
[13:46:18] <bot-t> Mkop: false
[13:46:20] <johnkpaul> I meant, mine, as in I'm a participant in the jQuery channel
[13:46:26] <Mkop> ?eval jQuery("&lt;div class=\'test\'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;")
[13:46:27] <bot-t> Mkop: []
[13:46:55] <DerekPioneer> what have i started...
[13:48:01] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: just a big :'( about the bot
[13:48:22] <johnkpaul> kanzie: no, I don't believe that you can, perhaps make a factory for your jqXHR's
[13:48:49] <kanzie> johnkpaul: I did something similar to that and passed the callback-method to use but it started leaking memory
[13:48:54] <kanzie> perhaps unrelated
[13:49:11] <Mkop> yeah, bot is weird
[13:49:24] <Mkop> ?eval $('<div></div>')
[13:49:25] <bot-t> Mkop: [<div>]
[13:49:32] <Mkop> ?eval $('<div>a</div>')
[13:49:33] <bot-t> Mkop: TypeError: div is undefined
[13:49:34] <johnkpaul> ??? what
[13:50:16] <johnkpaul> kanzie: perhaps you can get the url and the post parameters from the jqXHR object passed to the error callback
[13:51:10] <kanzie> johnkpaul: Im investigating passing this to itself
[13:51:14] <kanzie> $.ajax(this)
[13:51:29] <johnkpaul> in the error callback?
[13:51:48] <kanzie> yeah, trying
[13:51:57] <DerekPioneer> doesn't seem like i can return true or false inside ajax() http://jsfiddle.net/CEnd5/
[13:51:59] <Mkop> that sounds like a delicious recipe for spaghetti :-)
[13:52:02] <DerekPioneer> just always returns false
[13:52:24] <Mkop> ajpiano: do you know who "owns" bot-t?
[13:52:37] <bartmax> anyone knows how can i set a bool flag isEdited to a knockout object whenever i edit any property of the object ?
[13:52:40] <ajpiano> Mkop: i'm trying to deal with the bot issues
[13:52:43] <johnkpaul> kanzie: I think yo're on to something
[13:52:50] <ajpiano> Mkop: temp01 does but he has disappeared into the earth
[13:52:55] <ajpiano> or something
[13:52:58] <johnkpaul> "this" seems to be set to the jquery config sent to $.ajax
[13:52:59] <ajpiano> so bot-t is kind of like a free agent
[13:53:08] <bartmax> lol
[13:53:19] <ajpiano> Mkop: smplstk made the new caniuse bot to be a backup and also provide some other info but it's new so still some kinks
[13:53:41] <Mkop> bot-t.com has expired, despite being linked to from http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[13:53:43] <smplstk> lol "kinks"
[13:53:51] <ajpiano> Mkop: yes, we are aware of this
[13:54:12] <Mkop> ?cache bot-t.com
[13:54:12] <bot-t> Mkop, Google Cache - http://google.com/search?q=cache:bot-t.com
[13:54:13] <ajpiano> i should just take factoids off of there i guess

[13:54:31] * smplstk nods
[13:54:54] <Mkop> bot-t's cache link also doesn't work (404)
[13:55:07] <xp_prg> If I do a JSON call and I want to somehow report the progress to the user, can I analyze what is being returned in realtime?
[13:55:10] <Mkop> although, google's 404 is slightly amusing
[13:58:20] <kanzie> johnkpaul: seems to work!
[13:59:15] <johnkpaul> awesome,
[13:59:22] <johnkpaul> taht's a really good tip
[13:59:29] <johnkpaul> not necessarily because you should re-request on error
[13:59:37] <johnkpaul> but it's good that you have all of the original parameters at your disposal
[13:59:40] <johnkpaul> in both sucess and error
[13:59:52] <johnkpaul> I wonder if that's true if you use the deferred versions
[14:00:18] <Mkop> smplstk: is caniuse gonna have ?eval capabilities?
[14:00:25] <Mkop> it would be cool if he could
[14:00:29] <Mkop> (she?)
[14:00:44] <DerekPioneer> ajax() success always returns undefined. http://jsfiddle.net/3FejV/
[14:00:45] <DerekPioneer> i
[14:00:45] <DerekPioneer> rea
[14:00:45] <DerekPioneer> la
[14:00:48] <DerekPioneer> whoa
[14:00:55] <jedimind> easy on the enter key there
[14:01:05] <DerekPioneer> i realize ajax() is async but can't figure out how to do anything differently
[14:01:14] <kanzie> johnkpaul: my problem now is if I put that in a setTimeout() then this changes to DOMWindow instead of Object
[14:01:18] <smplstk> Mkop: it already does
[14:01:23] <smplstk> eval 2+2
[14:01:23] <caniuse> smplstk: 4
[14:01:25] <Mkop> oh it does?
[14:01:35] <safani> hello all
[14:01:36] <Mkop> eval $('<div></div>')
[14:01:36] <caniuse> Mkop: 'ReferenceError: $ is not defined'
[14:01:43] <Mkop> eval jQuery('<div></div>')
[14:01:43] <caniuse> Mkop: 'ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined'
[14:01:50] <smplstk> Mkop: no jQuery :(
[14:02:16] <safani> what is the best way to read and display data from a json object through ajax
[14:02:22] <Mkop> if your goal is to replace bot-t, you should make it respond to ?eval instead/in addition to eval
[14:02:38] <safani> or some good ways
[14:02:50] <smplstk> Mkop: it does, but only if bot-t isn't around (at least I think it does)
[14:03:01] <Mkop> oh, that's funny
[14:03:20] <smplstk> that was the idea with the jQuery api as well, but it apparently failed.
[14:03:27] <smplstk> atleast in the case of ?has
[14:03:28] <johnkpaul> kanzie: you need to use the var self = this pattern or bind it to the context of it's definition
[14:04:03] <fission61> how do i do a wild car in a selector such as $('#company-carousel-*')
[14:04:10] <kanzie> yeah, but how do I pass self to the anon function in setTimeout
[14:04:50] <johnkpaul> well, you could not make it anonymous anymore if that's your worry
[14:04:55] <johnkpaul> but it doesn't have to be named
[14:05:01] <johnkpaul> you could use a IIFE
[14:05:35] <johnkpaul> can you show your code kanzie?

[14:08:01] <johnkpaul> neumino: does your url include callback=?
[14:08:15] <johnkpaul> getJSON by itself doesn't support cross domain, you need to make it jsonp
[14:08:27] <johnkpaul> which means that the server needs to cooperate, and provide that way of accessing it
[14:08:44] <neumino> johnkpaul, no, why ?

[14:17:07] <davidthedrake> Hello. I'm trying to do $("#element").append(new Option('someVal', 'someText')); but this is not working in IE8. Only the value comes through, not the text. Any help?
[14:17:17] <Mkop> tetradon: huh?
[14:17:19] <jajmon> Mkop, now?
[14:17:50] <Mkop> jajmon: what do you mean? var obj = $("<div>foo</div>");
[14:18:02] <tetradon> Mkop: when I use toggle to "untoggle" the word class remains? what's up with that?
[14:18:24] <jajmon> so its that simple, huh
[14:18:27] <jajmon> :)
[14:18:34] <Mkop> tetradon: where does it remain? in Firebug? who cares if it's visibile?
[14:18:39] <Mkop> visible*
[14:19:19] <TehShrike|Work> tetradon: http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[14:19:22] <davidthedrake> Nevermind.
[14:19:45] <Mkop> the representation in firebug doesn't mean much. care about what's on the page, not what's in firebug
[14:19:53] <tetradon> so for instance, if I have no class attribute and toggle a class, i get class="className" (cool). but when I untoggle the class it leaves "class"
[14:20:01] <TehShrike|Work> tetradon: http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[14:20:03] <Mkop> tetradon: why do you care?
[14:20:13] <TehShrike|Work> tetradon: >:-|
[14:20:16] <tetradon> Mkop: because it's ugly and bad html
[14:20:23] * TehShrike|Work coughs loudly
[14:20:41] <tetradon> toggle should also remove the class attribute too
[14:21:26] <tetradon> i mean there's .removeClass which makes sense that it doesn't remove the class attribute...that's what .toggle should be for
[14:21:28] <tetradon> but it doesn't lol
[14:21:43] <Mkop> you are misunderstanding the role of HTML
[14:21:53] <Mkop> HTML is markup that the browser uses to construct the DOM
[14:22:06] <Mkop> once the DOM is constructed, you are manipulating the DOM not the underlying HTML
[14:22:12] <tetradon> yeah and having the word "class" in your html is not validated html
[14:22:14] <Mkop> Firebug gives an HTML representation of the DOM
[14:22:15] <tetradon> it's bad html
[14:22:40] <Mkop> but the DOM is not actually HTML
[14:22:47] <Mkop> your HTML never has the word class in it
[14:22:48] <tetradon> well i know that but still it's ugly
[14:23:09] <Mkop> then complain to firebug devs. it has nothing to do with JS/jQuery behavior
[14:23:25] <tetradon> it has nothing to do with firebug either lol
[14:23:33] <Mkop> of course it does.
[14:23:35] <tetradon> i'm using google chrome
[14:23:38] <tetradon> lol
[14:23:45] <Mkop> ok, then complain to chrome inspector devs
[14:24:04] <tetradon> No I should complain to jQuery devs

[14:25:31] <thomedy> and getting a null
[14:25:36] <thomedy> it def has content in it
[14:25:54] <thomedy> because there is alwasy at least another div inside it as well as a label
[14:25:57] <thomedy> but im getting a null
[14:26:07] <thomedy> i also tried '#div', this
[14:26:08] <TehShrike|Work> thomedy: you have an element with id="div"?
[14:26:11] <thomedy> as a selector
[14:26:17] <thomedy> no its jsut an example
[14:26:22] <thomedy> that describes a div
[14:26:38] <tetradon> lol...i was about to say
[14:26:41] <thomedy> its a long name for a div and div gets the idea of the id accros
[14:26:57] <Mkop> is #div actually a descendant of $(this)?
[14:26:57] <TehShrike|Work> aah, I prefer #some-div-name in cases like that :-P
[14:27:15] <thomedy> okay thats fine however why am i getting a null
[14:27:26] <thomedy> im doing my selectors right arent i
[14:27:41] <thomedy> in my googling it said that will be fine
[14:27:41] <Mkop> thomedy: without showing us your markup, we can't possibly know if your selectors are right. see ?jsfiddle

[14:27:50] <thomedy> okay ill do a quick js fiddle
[14:28:00] <thomedy> i just dont have alot of ttime thats all

[14:34:12] <thomedy> its nothing like the complexity of my other set.. however its the pertinant code
[14:34:46] <thomedy> in the past i would pass in an e and run an event
[14:34:54] <thomedy> but i think thats prob newb

[14:35:13] <thomedy> ha ya
[14:35:14] <thomedy> thanks
[14:35:23] <Mkop> once you do that it works fine for me
[14:35:32] <thomedy> see now it works fine for me too
[14:35:32] <thomedy> ha
[14:35:47] <thomedy> okay let me check my actuall thing
[14:35:55] <thomedy> and maybe past it
[14:35:55] <Mkop> that's the beauty of jsfiddle. it takes care of any ego issues.
[14:36:28] <Mkop> you thought you were smart? well, guess what, a stranger on IRC will find a bug in your 3-line snippet of code
[14:36:33] <Mkop> does that to all of us :-)
[14:37:04] <Mkop> I don't mean to insult, but rather to sympathize :-)
[14:38:10] <thomedy> i dont take that as an insult i dont have time
[14:38:13] <thomedy> next question
[14:38:18] <thomedy> wait maybe not
[14:40:22] <badbandit> hello, I am using jquery UI tabs and I want to swap out the content of an adjacent div based on the tab selected... I started writing something like this http://hastebin.com/lavutayuro.django, but wasnt sure what the best method to actually swap the divs is? I hide all of them on page load
[14:40:36] <thomedy> i just figured out my problem
[14:40:41] <thomedy> its not a child its a sibling
[14:40:56] <thomedy> is there a sibling  selector reaal quick
[14:41:20] <ravenzz> there is
[14:41:21] <ravenzz> :)
[14:41:32] <ravenzz> guess what is its name?
[14:41:37] <thomedy> sibling
[14:41:39] <thomedy> ?
[14:41:52] <ravenzz> +s
[14:42:32] <ravenzz> or siblings/next/nextAll/prev/prevAll
[14:43:13] <xp_prg> nobody will answer my question :(
[14:43:37] <thomedy> alright that did it thank you

[14:49:29] <SoulRaven> the problem is on success method in $.ajax, when the close method for the dialog must be called, and sometimes the dialog is closed, sometimes is not, any history about this problems?
[14:50:09] <chovy> xp_prg: i don't think you can get a percentage complete, but you can load a spinner until the request comes back.
[14:50:25] <xp_prg> chovy how do I load a spinner easily in jquery?
[14:50:33] <xp_prg> also I don't except the non-feedback argument
[14:50:37] <Mkop> just put a spinner.png somewhere
[14:50:43] <chovy> $("form").submit(function(e){
[14:50:54] <chovy>   //load spinner
[14:51:15] <chovy>  $.post('/foo', $(this).serialize(), function(d){ //unload spinner });
[14:51:17] <Mkop> using raw XMLHttpRequest you can get basic status information, but it's nowhere near as informative as you'd need to be helpful to a user
[14:51:17] <chovy> });
[14:51:58] <xp_prg> chovy I don't understand the //load spinner approach
[14:52:01] <xp_prg> I want real code there
[14:52:09] <Mkop> ok, I'm heading out. good luck y'all
[14:52:28] <chovy> xp_prg: i usually give my container a class of "loading" and then remove the class when the response comes back.
[14:52:45] <chovy> and show a spinner.gif in css for .loading
[14:52:51] <xp_prg> I was hoping for a more generic easy way then that
[14:53:18] <chovy> that's probably as easy as you're going to get.
[14:53:33] <chovy> you could use fadeTo()
[14:56:53] <Emn1ty> Is it possible to get this to print whats in the new window upon opening it? http://jsfiddle.net/VAbPW/29/
[14:57:20] <dschuett> anyone willing to take a stab at why this page is giving the following error on my show more link "SCRIPT1002: Syntax error index2.php, line 2 character 1" it's weird because the show more button works about the first three clicks. then fails. http://www.trucktirewholesale.com/tires/index2.php
[14:57:58] <dschuett> ^^ only in IE9
[14:59:23] <smplstk> Emn1tyn, you can print with window.print()
[15:01:19] <Emn1ty> yes, but how do I get that into the new popup?
[15:02:25] <oojacoboo> so, I have this autocomplete input and I'm using keyboard commands (up, down, etc) to move around the dropdown list.  The issue is that when I hit up, it takes the cursor to the beginning of the input.  Is there a way to disable this within an input, or any ideas here?
[15:04:31] <oojacoboo> n/m I'm just going to leave it alone as this could conflict with some intended behavior and it's a minor issue
[15:06:18] <neumino> When I'm using $.getJSON(url, callback) how can I send extra arguments in my callback ?
[15:06:24] <Emn1ty> got it working: http://jsfiddle.net/VAbPW/32/
[15:06:39] <oojacoboo> nebbie``: use a callback function?
[15:06:47] <oojacoboo> pass the arguments in the function
[15:07:03] <oojacoboo> neumino:
[15:07:08] <neumino> so $.getJSON(url, callback(answer, extra_data)
[15:07:10] <neumino> just like that ?
[15:07:17] <oojacoboo> yea
[15:07:18] <xp_prg>  $("#type_tbl_data tr").live("click", function() { I want to add the id: #aff_tbl_data_tr
[15:07:21] <neumino> Ok, thanks
[15:07:31] <xp_prg> can I somehow combine both?
[15:08:16] <oojacoboo> xp_prg: $(this).attr();
[15:08:42] <xp_prg> I am trying to avoid this: $("#aff_tbl_data tr")
[15:08:50] <chovy> .
[15:09:12] <xp_prg> can I somehow specify more than one id I want to bind a .live function to?
[15:09:18] <oojacoboo> yes
[15:09:24] <oojacoboo> use a comma
[15:09:29] <oojacoboo> just like css
[15:09:50] <oojacoboo> also, look into the .on() function if you're using 1.6+
[15:09:57] <xp_prg> but then I have to do this right?  $("#type_tbl_data tr, #aff_tbl_data tr").
[15:10:22] <xp_prg> I want to use like a regular expression so I can just do something like: #*_tbl_data tr).
[15:10:29] <xp_prg> is that possible?
[15:10:56] <ajpiano> ?attributestartswith @ xp_prg
[15:10:56] <bot-t> xp_prg, [attribute^="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[15:11:45] <xp_prg> ajpiano you play on my keyboard any time!
[15:11:58] <xp_prg> do you know the jquery selector I would use?
[15:12:31] <ajpiano> oh you want ends with
[15:12:56] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: why use an efficient selector?
[15:13:03] <oojacoboo> inefficient*
[15:13:17] <ajpiano> $("table[id$='tbl_data']")
[15:13:18] <oojacoboo> ends with is $
[15:13:36] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: with table tag it shouldn't be that bad
[15:13:39] <ajpiano> even with, it isn't
[15:13:54] <ajpiano> a huge deal
[15:14:01] <ajpiano> but def should include the tag
[15:14:12] <xp_prg> its inneficient?
[15:14:13] <oojacoboo> I would specify a common parent before it regardless
[15:14:24] <oojacoboo> closest one
[15:14:45] <ajpiano> i really wouldn't sweat it
[15:14:46] <xp_prg> do these kind of element selectors work in css as well?
[15:14:56] <oojacoboo> xp_prg: 2.1 yes
[15:15:01] <ajpiano> the regex selectors aren't in css
[15:15:03] <oojacoboo> caniuse.com
[15:15:09] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: ??
[15:15:13] <oojacoboo> yes they are
[15:15:24] <ajpiano> oh whoops that was dumb
[15:16:11] <xp_prg> ok, stupid question, lets say I had control over what browsers I wanted to develop for, which browser would I choose if I want to handle the most current stable html5, css3, jquery etc... functionality
[15:16:15] <xp_prg> would it be chrome or firefox?
[15:16:29] <oojacoboo> webkit xp_prg
[15:16:44] <oojacoboo> chrome probably
[15:17:32] <oojacoboo> xp_prg: actually, Opera
[15:17:38] <oojacoboo> that'd be a pretty good choice too
[15:17:43] <oojacoboo> they're amazing at following spec
[15:17:52] <Vorspire> develop for IE, then if it works in IE, everything else works, or supposedly works, then you don't have to make an awesome site for chrome and firefox, then boot up IE to find out it looks like a Picasso piece. I hate IE.
[15:19:26] <xp_prg> ok I heart you all
[15:19:46] <Whirl3d> So in the animation engine, there's the "step" option that passes a value to a callback. If you want it to pass a percentage complete, how would you go about doing that without storing the current state and comparing the next "step" callback to it?
[15:20:19] <chovy> xp_prg: either should work fine.
[15:20:25] <chovy> it's older versions of IE that are the problem.
[15:21:28] <ShawnRisk> what is wrong with this code: jQuery(function() { alert(jQuery("div#block-block-1.content p a").text); });, this is coming out as html not text?
[15:23:00] <xp_prg> on the jquery selector I need the id that was selected, any idea how I get it?
[15:23:20] <xp_prg> I think its like $(this).parent.attr('id') ?
[15:23:20] <jugglinmike> ShawnRisk: $.fn.text is a function--you'll need to invoke it, Try jQuery(function() { alert(jQuery("div#block-block-1.content p a").text()); });
[15:23:54] <jugglinmike> xp_prg: it depends on the value of "this" in your example, but that's the general idea
[15:24:16] <Vorspire> </3 alert()
[15:24:35] * xp_prg hearts jugglinmike, you can juggle me any time :>
[15:26:00] <jugglinmike> Alright I'll let you know
[15:27:09] <ShawnRisk> what jugglinmike did didn't work out as I get a blank alert now
[15:27:26] <ericdfields> i'm attempting to muck w/ the html the jquery ui date picker produces. i see it has a 'beforeShow' event, which i can get to fire off alerts, but can't seem to do things like inst.dpDiv.wrap('<div class="foo"></div>')… anyone ever work w/ this?
[15:31:48] <xp_prg> I am trying to find the closest table, I try .closest('table') but it give me tbody
[15:38:40] <Robbo_> I have a transition and when it ends I want to basically reset it. I am doing this with jQuery.... when ended it will remove the class with the transition, set the css and then add the class again. I thought this would simply reset it but it doesn't do near that, it tries to use the transition again
[15:38:45] <Robbo_> How can I use jQuery to move something (left: 0 in this case) and not use the transition?
[15:40:24] <pifantastic> ?css @ Robbo_
[15:40:25] <bot-t> Robbo_, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[15:41:17] <Robbo_> Oh ya think?
[15:41:34] <Robbo_> I have tried that
[15:42:39] <oojacoboo> ?testcase

[15:42:45] <oojacoboo> Robbo_: ^^
[15:43:28] <bartmax> in knockout.js, how can i make to do a bool value isModified if I changed any other value of an item ?
[15:43:44] <confounds> bartmax you must think this is #knockoutjs
[15:44:10] <confounds> easy to get confused
[15:44:16] <bartmax> confounds: no, #knockoutjs is an empty channel ... i don't like talking to nobody :D
[15:44:37] <bartmax> confounds: if anyone here knows i know he/she will be willing to help, that's it.
[15:45:43] <confounds> bartmax sure except the topic is jquery here, not knockout ;) they prob have a mailing list too
[15:45:49] <miznitic> How does one change the value/selection of a dropdown? I thought it would be something akin to $('#mySelect').val('option1'); //Assuming choice 1 has a value="option1"
[15:46:38] <bartmax> confounds: like never answered an html/css question here....
[15:48:33] <confounds> bartmax fair point, though that's way broader & often overlaps with jquery. just saying you'll prob have better luck some other way
[15:49:04] <bartmax> ko works on top of jquery... sometimes ko answers are to use jquery solutions.
[15:49:16] <bartmax> confounds: nevermind, it's ok if noone answers :D
[15:49:32] <confounds> bartmax cool :)
[15:49:51] <bartmax> confounds: and btw, i would love if a ko.js channel exists, but couldn't find any. and I'm not the mailing-list type guy :D
[15:50:12] <confounds> bartmax there is one, seems to be only 5 or 6 members
[15:50:21] <confounds> maybe a sign to switch to a diff mvc framework
[15:50:37] <bartmax> where is it ?
[15:51:09] <bartmax> confounds: nah, MS is supporting jQuery & Knockout. that's more than enough
[15:51:10] <bartmax> :d
[15:51:16] <confounds> #knockoutjs
[15:51:40] <confounds> i know, very unintuitive name for the channel :P
[16:08:15] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[16:08:33] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Coldhead (http://home.no/reddvinylene/coldhead.mp3)
[16:08:59] <coldhead> the fuck!
[16:09:05] <mikkelb> muzone: nice
[16:10:25] <muzone> hehe thanks yall
[16:10:34] <muzone> coldhead didnt mean to put u on the spot, ill change the name
[16:11:02] <coldhead> naw that's fine
[16:11:12] <youngin> daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
[16:11:16] <coldhead> i was worried it was a private recording of me molesting children
[16:11:18] <youngin> muzone how you get that sound?
[16:11:20] <coldhead> but it isn't
[16:11:22] <coldhead> so we're good
[16:11:29] <muzone> lol
[16:12:21] <coldhead> how DID you get that sound?
[16:13:22] * youngin puts muzone on the spot
[16:13:48] <muzone> hehe i dunno
[16:13:55] <muzone> i just think of girls i guess
[16:14:03] <muzone> well ofcourse some knowledge of tape and vinyl wont hurt
[16:14:24] <mikkelb> sounds like dilla
[16:14:27] <mikkelb> or flying lotus
[16:14:43] <muzone> now THAT
[16:14:48] <muzone> really means a lot
[16:14:57] <coldhead> i would listen to dilla if he sounded more like this :P
[16:15:24] <muzone> group hug, beer and weed passing around for y'all
[16:15:42] <muzone> i never expected positive vibes like these
[16:15:51] <mikkelb> :^)
[16:16:01] <nFFF> always positie vybez
[16:16:13] <coldhead> well it's not all positive: my media player showed a visualiation that displeased me while i listened
[16:16:25] <coldhead> i don't blame you for that
[16:16:29] <coldhead> but someone must pay
[16:16:36] <youngin> heh
[16:16:38] <youngin> i can pay
[16:16:43] <youngin> as long as this dude gets to do his thing
[16:36:50] <fr0ggie> is there a good example of the right way to do a web-desktop (with windowed applications)?
[16:38:57] <fr0ggie> I have a bunch of small modules (php, python, or ruby usually) which emit the partial HTML for the window. IDs are to be like mod/instance id (cam.inputs/abcdef0123456789) for example -- Some windows can only exist once so have no ID
[16:39:47] <youngin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVnNrbtLuoM
[16:44:57] <xboi209> How do I display different images based on browser?
[16:48:05] <mikkelb> youngin: fierce :^)
[16:48:28] <xboi209> How do I display different images based on browser?
[16:49:45] <youngin> dunno i just heard muzone was into that stuff so
[16:50:11] <coldhead> ?$.browser @ xboi209
[16:50:11] <mikkelb> yeah probably explains why he know his drums so well
[16:50:12] <bot-t> xboi209, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[16:53:16] <scr3am> guys i got a serious problem, the jquery.cookie version on github got problems with arrays, always returning "null"... anyone a working one?
[16:59:53] <coldhead> scr3am: cookies are strings
[17:00:03] <coldhead> i would use JSON to encode the array into a string
[17:00:07] <coldhead> and store that string
[17:00:17] <coldhead> and decode it upon recovery
[17:00:18] <scr3am> i found out 2 minutes ago ;-)
[17:00:25] <coldhead> thanks for letting us know :P
[17:00:31] <coldhead> good luck buddy!
[17:00:44] <scr3am> well i'm not sure, still testing
[17:00:53] <scr3am> try join, split
[17:01:25] <scr3am> we'll see... night is long ;-)
[17:01:58] <coldhead> you COULD use join and split
[17:02:01] <coldhead> buuut
[17:02:09] <coldhead> what if later you want to store an object, instead of an array
[17:02:13] <coldhead> or an array of objects
[17:02:19] <coldhead> json works now, and for the future
[17:02:23] <coldhead> like early devo songs
[17:03:30] <mikkelb> coldhead: devoooooooooo
[17:03:49] <mikkelb> for life girl
[17:04:35] <xboi209> Is there a way to simultaneously load multiple .src files?
[17:05:24] <coldhead> what are .src files?
[17:05:30] <xboi209> source
[17:05:35] <xboi209> source files
[17:06:22] <coldhead> oh right
[17:06:25] <coldhead> in that case, no
[17:06:30] <coldhead> they must be loaded one at a time
[17:07:19] <xboi209> :/
[17:07:26] <xboi209> A custom script can do it
[17:09:14] <coldhead> xboi209: <script async="true" ...> ?
[17:09:35] <xboi209> is that jquery or javascript?
[17:09:45] <coldhead> that's HTML
[17:10:08] <xboi209> o ya
[17:10:11] <coldhead> http://caniuse.com/#search=async
[17:10:31] <coldhead> good support outside of IE
[17:10:52] <xboi209> (and opera_
[17:11:11] <coldhead> pfft, who even uses opera
[17:11:13] <coldhead> weirdos
[17:11:18] <xboi209> lol
[17:11:22] <coldhead> those guys expect everything to work wrong anyway
[17:11:25] <xboi209> anyways, this is html5?
[17:11:32] <coldhead> sure, why not
[17:11:39] <xboi209> no wonder i never heard of it :P
[17:13:03] <nickwiscool> HI I WANT MAKE FACEBOOK WITH JQUERY FOR MY 6TH GRADE PROJECT!!!!!!!!!!!! I KNOW HTML ALOOT PLS I NEED IT BY TOMARROW MORNING
[17:13:18] <nickwiscool> WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME~!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?
[17:13:24] <xboi209> lol good luck
[17:13:28] <xboi209> html is simply not enough
[17:13:45] <coldhead> nickwiscool: start by drawing a state diagram
[17:13:51] <coldhead> and a UML flow chart
[17:13:56] <coldhead> use colored crayons
[17:13:58] <coldhead> be speicifc
[17:14:01] <coldhead> give examples
[17:14:13] <xboi209> html and jquery is simply not enough*
[17:14:16] <coldhead> name the users "Alice" and "Bob"
[17:14:54] <bartmax> on kojs, <button data-secret="12341234" type="button" data-bind="click: model.save">save</button>
[17:14:55] <bartmax> can i get the 'secret' value on the click binding ?
[17:17:16] <coldhead> bartmax: from jQuery's perspective it should just be $(this).data('secret')
[17:17:25] <coldhead> oh well fuck you then buddy
[17:17:27] <coldhead> fuck you
[17:17:41] <coldhead> NIIICO
[17:17:53] <nickwiscool> here is what i have so far, i am good with html
[17:17:55] <nickwiscool> want proofs?
[17:18:03] <nickwiscool> http://66.27.69.142
[17:18:08] <nickwiscool> i know lots html
[17:18:57] <nickwiscool> like my site?!
[17:19:02] <nickwiscool> i wanna make it like facebook
[17:19:02] <coldhead> nickwiscool: http://coldhead.miketaylr.com/
[17:19:10] <coldhead> wanna join my web ring?
[17:19:44] <chovy> nickwiscool: that rocks.
[17:19:45] <nickwiscool> oh mah gawd
[17:19:48] <nickwiscool> surew
[17:19:54] <chovy> web ring :)
[17:19:56] <nickwiscool> ive neaver been on one of them
[17:20:19] <chovy> web ring was the precursor to stumbler
[17:21:11] <coldhead> web ring will never die
[17:21:16] <coldhead> it's like a marriage
[17:21:24] <coldhead> of heaven and hell
[17:21:28] <coldhead> but with nachos
[17:23:27] <coldhead> bartmax: $(this).data('secret') but that depends on this being the element, your framework may have other ideas
[17:23:42] <bartmax> coldhead: yup
[17:23:50] <bartmax> coldhead: for the other ideas :D
[17:24:27] <bartmax> is it safe to use srcElement in event ? [i mean, ie will have it? ]
[17:25:00] <chovy> bartmax: $(e).target
[17:25:03] <Phizes> nickwiscool, coldhead: I have not seen such repeating gif backgrounds for so long that they are again nauseating
[17:25:33] <bartmax> chovy: that's safe ?
[17:25:42] <chovy> should be.
[17:25:46] <chovy> that's how I do it.
[17:26:02] <Aylham> Hello everyone
[17:26:26] <chovy> bartmax: it might be $(e.target);
[17:26:39] <chovy> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[17:26:48] <xboi209> hey coldhead, are you sure the async tag will simultaneously load src files?
[17:26:48] <bartmax> chovy: yea figured it out. still not sure if it's safe enough :D
[17:27:26] <chovy> try it and see
[17:27:59] <coldhead> xboi209: of course i'm not sure, i just read about it on a reputable site
[17:28:11] <coldhead> can we ever really be sure of anything?
[17:28:13] <coldhead> what IS certainty?
[17:28:17] <xboi209> oh great, looks like I gotta do some googling
[17:28:24] <chovy> unfortunately it doesn't say whether e.target works in IE or not.
[17:28:27] <imsky> la la la
[17:28:34] <coldhead> i was "certain" we were going to get married, and then i found her in a threesome with my dad and my best friend
[17:28:52] <imsky> coldhead, the "real life story" troll maestro
[17:28:54] <coldhead> sup caniuse
[17:28:57] <chovy> that's just wrong.
[17:31:42] <Aylham> can I ask for some help? First I have to say I looked for at least 4h on the web and on the documention (RTFW,RTFM etc...). I know it will probably look a noob question but thats what I am :/ And I know Im using an old version but its the version provided by my teacher and I dont want any compatibility problem
[17:32:03] <thang> go on
[17:32:34] <coldhead> less apologies, more substance
[17:32:38] <steveoh> does jquery polyfill JSON.stringify
[17:32:39] <coldhead> fewer*
[17:33:07] <xboi209> hey coldhead
[17:33:31] <xboi209> is it possible i can do like <script src="1" src="2" src="3">?
[17:33:53] <Aylham> first my code http://pastebin.com/tMvwP4Wj My problem is on the draggable(start) function I can put the parent element droppable but my selector is working for the addClass so I dont understand what to do
[17:34:18] <coldhead> steveoh: it must do, to work everywhere it does
[17:34:31] <ajpiano> steveoh: no it doesn't
[17:34:32] <coldhead> xboi209: no, one src per script tag
[17:34:39] <ajpiano> ?stringify @ steveoh
[17:34:40] <bot-t> steveoh, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[17:35:03] <steveoh> thanks ajpiano
[17:35:12] <steveoh> get a haircut :)
[17:35:17] <steveoh> j/k
[17:35:20] <xboi209> coldhead: So if I use 3 separate script tags with async in them, they'll all load as if they were in 1 tag?
[17:35:34] <nickwiscool> ive neaver been on one of them
[17:35:34] <nickwiscool> ive neaver been on one of them
[17:35:49] <coldhead> xboi209: it will allow them to load simultaneously
[17:35:55] <xboi209> cool
[17:35:55] <coldhead> but they're still 3 separate tags
[17:36:02] <coldhead> what is all this for, anyway?
[17:36:05] <xboi209> ok then

[17:39:33] <Aylham> thanks coldhead, will check this :)
[17:42:49] <zanberdo> I am using a very simple $.get() to retrieve a record count from my server. When I trace the call in firebug the GET terminates with status 200. However, when I cut-and-paste the http call reported by firebug of the $.get() the server return the record count. Question: why would $.get() not go beyond a status 200?  Please see http://jsfiddle.net/EmSuE/
[17:43:47] <xboi209> coldhead you still here?
[17:43:59] <coldhead> zanberdo: are you trying to do a get() to a different domain?
[17:44:19] <coldhead> xboi209: apparently
[17:44:43] <zanberdo> coldhead, no. I am specifying the FQDN but it's the same server as the script is being called from (obviously I can't simulate that in jsfiddle unfortunately)
[17:44:53] <rajkosto> any idea why my getJSON handler never fires ? http://blog.livenewschat.tv/test/
[17:44:53] <xboi209> when using the async tag, is it possible for some parts of the page to load first than the source file?
[17:44:57] <zanberdo> but jsfiddle exhibits the same results
[17:45:38] <zanberdo> coldhead, hmm... let me think about that question a little further.
[17:46:59] <coldhead> xboi209: for that kind of complexity you should look at require.js or similar
[17:47:06] <coldhead> you'll go mad doing it manually
[17:47:36] <coldhead> zanberdo: i would lose the FQDN for simplicity (and to rule that out as an issue)
[17:47:59] <zanberdo> coldhead, yeah, I'm looking at that now. thanks
[17:48:05] <coldhead> then if you're definitely getting a 200... i would maybe try specifying a dataType
[17:48:13] <coldhead> so jQuery doesn't try to guess
[17:50:13] <zanberdo> coldhead, gah! That was it. Of course, in my dev environment the FQDN didn't seem to throw any errors, but once I deployed to a qa server (or live) it does. Stupid mistake on my part. Thanks!
[17:51:31] <coldhead> have fun zanberdo

[18:00:50] <xp_prg> any ideas what I am doing wrong?
[18:01:57] <aaairc> Does anyone know what is causing the error in this simple example i made on jsfiddle?
[18:01:57] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/C8nfg/1/
[18:02:25] <aaairc> I'm getting an Unexpected token Illegal SyntaxError, when trying to define a fairly simple javascript object
[18:04:12] <xp_prg> figured it out, type o
[18:08:31] <xp_prg> can I use a regular expression and get the text out of it right away?
[18:08:47] <coldhead> xp_prg: it's okay with me
[18:09:05] <xp_prg> can you show me an example like this: 1_2_3_4 I want to get 2 out of there

[18:11:15] <coldhead> now you have two problems lolol
[18:11:36] <mikkelb> muzone: i wanna hear more
[18:12:49] <muzone> oh man
[18:12:52] <aaairc> here is a simpler example. the problem is, is that description definition is coming from my controller, and dropped directly into the template... it seems like it drops it in with these hard returns that screws up the variable definition
[18:12:52] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/C8nfg/6/
[18:13:14] <muzone> im flattered but i aint really got that much, i spend all my time trying to make this money, aint got much time for beats
[18:13:16] <aaairc> not exactly sure how to combat this... i guess in the controller before it gets to the view i have to replace any hard returns with a "\n"
[18:13:36] <mikkelb> pffft
[18:13:38] <mikkelb> i know u got some :P
[18:13:57] <muzone> hehe
[18:13:59] <muzone> alright man fine
[18:14:36] <Aylham> coldhead: looked about the us.helper but its the object currently being dropped, and Im looking to put the parent div of my draggable element droppable at the start of the dragging. Which dont know why accept an addClass and apparently the droppable because the ui-droppable class is set but I still cant drop other elements after :/

[18:17:21] <cincinnatus> Is it "dirty" to use getattr/setattr with property names that aren't valid identifiers (e.g. setattr(foo, 'My Awful Property', 'Bar')?
[18:18:20] <mikkelb> holy mother of
[18:19:42] <mikkelb> what the fuck is this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[18:19:52] <mikkelb> oh its just jizz in my pants
[18:19:57] <mikkelb> my brain was making love to itself
[18:20:33] <cincinnatus> I'm trying to have a non-developer generate a form, save it in mongodb and then dynamically generate a mongoengine model based off of it...
[18:20:53] <cincinnatus> I'm debating whether I should "normalize" the field names i.e. "First Name" -> "first_name"
[18:21:31] <muzone> haha you're too much man
[18:21:55] <muzone> thank you really
[18:22:42] <youngin> i bet muzone is running outta ways to thank people but damn
[18:22:46] <youngin> yeah that shit is hot
[18:23:19] <coldhead> cincinnatus: the best reason not to do that is if you're going to support other languages at some stage
[18:23:29] <coldhead> but if you can rule that out, sure, why not
[18:24:58] <cincinnatus> coldhead: Do you mean other than Python?
[18:29:48] <coldhead> cincinnatus: i mean Primo_Name
[18:29:55] <coldhead> except in italian
[18:29:58] <coldhead> which i don't speak
[18:30:01] <coldhead> actual italian
[18:30:08] <coldhead> Ze_firsta_namea
[18:33:02] <cincinnatus> coldhead: I want to keep this simple. The person generating the form will be like your average MS Office user who doesn't know how to use formulas in Excel.
[18:33:14] <astkfour> anyone help me with a count up timer? http://pastebin.com/2MecfFvW
[18:33:25] <astkfour> it coutns up randomly i need to go from 0 to 10
[18:34:15] <cincinnatus> coldhead: But I'm more concerned about future versions of Python or some API (e.g. mongoengine) borking up on a special character
[18:34:34] <coldhead> oh right
[18:34:53] <coldhead> i thought you meant html name="first_name"
[18:35:27] <cincinnatus> coldhead: Yeah, that too - but it will be auto-escaped.
[18:35:41] <cincinnatus> coldhead: But if I normalize it for Mongo, I'll normalize it for HTML too
[18:36:20] <scr3am1> it's driving me crazy... JSON.stringify, JSON.parse... does it make sense use this function when actually needing an array!!!!1

[18:40:08] <Whirl3d> is that the best thing? php

[18:43:41] <tw2113> i'm usually an observer in here
[18:43:57] <astkfour> whats the most simple way to count upward?

[18:45:10] * tw2113 cheers for himself
[18:45:11] <astkfour> ok but what does it mean when it counts from 0 to 60 to 200 each time it counts up its a larger random number
[18:45:28] <tw2113> foreach loop?
[18:45:31] <tw2113> for loop?
[18:46:18] <astkfour> i'm trying to make a timer using setTimeout
[18:46:31] <tw2113> ah
[18:46:36] <tw2113> context :)
[18:48:01] <youngin> coldhead: u should do something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY8nhHH_Zb0 to muzones music
[18:48:06] <ringotwo> you might wanna use setInterval() instead of setTimeout
[18:48:20] <astkfour> here is my code http://pastebin.com/2MecfFvW
[18:48:41] <astkfour> in the update function i have sessions variable counting up
[18:48:59] <ringotwo> astkfour, what isn't working right?
[18:49:23] <astkfour> it kind of works but it wont count up from 0 to 10 1..2..3.. like that
[18:49:31] <aaairc> i don't understand where a hard return is coming from
[18:49:59] <astkfour> in  $('#countup').html(session); it shows a whole lot of random numbers that get larger and larger
[18:50:02] <aaairc> when i look at page source my text appears as:    "diam.&lt"

[18:56:41] <youngin> if u aint got no phat on your behind all you gotta do is eat right and sleep right
[18:56:43] <astkfour> ringotwo but would that bypass my original countdown timer?

[18:56:58] <ringotwo> you're counting up, not down, i don't understand

[18:59:33] <coldhead> like fight the patriarchy
[19:00:32] <rhizmoe> noble.
[19:00:34] <astkfour> ok so right now it gets a random time between 10 minutes to 30 minutes and once this counts down to 0 it displays text in a div
[19:01:14] <astkfour> and my purpose of the count up is to make it only do 10 processes of the search function and then stop
[19:02:33] <ringotwo> this code needs to change a lot, i think
[19:02:55] <ringotwo> so you want to search 10 times, right?
[19:03:00] <ringotwo> and stop after ten times?
[19:03:34] <astkfour> yes
[19:04:05] <ringotwo> why a random number between 10 and 30 minutes?
[19:04:11] <ringotwo> why not just choose 20 minutes
[19:04:19] <ringotwo> it has to be random?
[19:04:50] <astkfour> no reason just something i used from a previous script it can be a fixed time
[19:05:08] <ringotwo> so you want to getJSON() every few minutes, right
[19:05:16] <astkfour> yes
[19:05:29] <ringotwo> you want to update the div every few minutes, 10 times
[19:06:03] <astkfour> yes
[19:06:07] <ringotwo> i think you just want to use a setInterval()
[19:06:23] <ringotwo> get rid of all these functions, just have one called update()
[19:06:40] <ringotwo> inside the update(), just have a setInterval() loop that increments each time through
[19:06:51] <astkfour> so somethin g like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2064186/how-can-i-make-a-jquery-countdown
[19:06:54] <ringotwo> set the interval to 2 minutes
[19:07:13] <ringotwo> and when you get to the tenth time, use clearInterval() to stop the interval
[19:07:29] <ringotwo> it's not really a countdown
[19:07:33] <ringotwo> that's the wrong idea
[19:08:30] <ringotwo> you just want to run the getJSON() function, increment the counter, wait two minutes, check the counter... repeat
[19:08:44] <ringotwo> you're incrementing the counter, there's no countdown
[19:10:33] <ringotwo> do a little reading on setInterval() and clearInterval(), i think that's the answer
[19:11:50] <ringotwo> setTimeout() can cause trouble in loops if you don't understand it well

[19:18:50] <smplstk> SORRY FOR ALL THE SPAMS EVERYONE
[19:19:02] <ringotwo> really? ;-)
[19:19:32] <Hawkee> how can I tell an autocomplete drawer to withdraw?
[19:20:11] <Hawkee> while I'm still in the box
[19:21:36] <ringotwo> are you using a plugin
[19:21:39] <ringotwo> hawkee
[19:22:01] <Hawkee> no, I'm writing a triggered autocomplete
[19:22:19] <Hawkee> so when I type @.+ the drawer comes down
[19:22:24] <Hawkee> but if I press space it should go back up
[19:24:05] <ringotwo> not sure exactly what you mean, but you might want to capture the keystrokes
[19:24:23] <Hawkee> I'm doing my own function for the source
[19:24:37] <Hawkee> and I just want to tell the autocomplete to slideUP
[19:25:18] <Aylham>     $('.cell div').draggable({
[19:25:19] <Aylham> grid:[100,100] ;
[19:25:19] <Aylham>  start: function ( event, ui ) {
[19:25:19] <Aylham> $(this).closest('.cell').droppable().addClass('emptyCell').removeClass('cell');  }
[19:25:19] <Aylham>     }); I cant write this?
[19:26:23] <ringotwo> i'd google keydown or keypress and check the keycode for the space key
[19:26:30] <ringotwo> i'm not sure what type of autocomplete you're talking about
[19:26:48] <ringotwo> browsers have their own autocomplete, which you wouldn't have much control over, if any
[19:26:54] <rajkosto> why is .html = "stuff" NOT DOING ANYTHING
[19:26:59] <Hawkee> I'm using the Jquery UI autocomplete
[19:27:01] <ringotwo> but if you've written your own autocomplete lib
[19:27:10] <Hawkee> and I am checking the string in the input box
[19:27:34] <Hawkee> I have certain criteria for when I return a list of suggestions
[19:27:38] <Hawkee> otherwise I don't offer a list
[19:28:03] <Whirl3d> aylham, you need to lo see if droppable is chainable...it might invoke the droppable behavior, but it looks like you are trying to use it as a selector. Of course, I am just guessing, really.
[19:28:05] <ringotwo> i'm sure the jqueryUI autcomplete api has a method to hide the autocomplete
[19:28:07] <Hawkee> but once I've offered a list and I want to dismiss it it won't dismiss unless I click outside the box
[19:28:17] <Hawkee> yes, that's what I'm trying to figure out
[19:28:32] <ringotwo> lemme see
[19:29:08] <Hawkee> aha, got it
[19:29:11] <Hawkee> this.close()
[19:29:13] <Hawkee> simple enough
[19:29:24] <ringotwo> nice
[19:30:13] <Aylham> Whirl3d: my problem was much more with the grid followed by the start: which is seems crashing ><
[19:31:15] <Hawkee> this has been a good challenge
[19:31:50] <Hawkee> not many solid @mention autocompletes available
[19:31:56] <Whirl3d> maybe you need a comma after the grid statement instead of a semi colon
[19:32:37] <Whirl3d> since it appears that grid:[10,10] is a parameter of the init object for draggable....
[19:33:30] <VioByte> Is there any plugin that would move draggable objects according the the width+height of the browser when resized? Say i move a draggable object to the corner of the browser, then i make the browser window smaller, but in the process the draggable is now out of view and i would have to scroll the page just to get to it.
[19:33:43] <Aylham> tried both before, but since I put the draggable appart its working with a coma. hmmm must sleep I think...
[19:35:17] <Whirl3d> sounds like you just need to bind the window.resize event to your draggables and have themadjust their positions when triggered
[19:35:53] <VioByte> yea i was thinking of that.. just take away the difference in pixels
[19:37:04] <Hawkee> argh, jQuery binds keyCode.UP/DOWN to preventDefault on textareas when using autocomplete
[19:37:15] <Hawkee> I wonder if they've addressed this in 1.9
[19:37:46] <Whirl3d> what about kepress?
[19:37:51] <Whirl3d> keypress
[19:39:38] <VioByte> So does anyone know if IE9 is actually up to internet standards? I hate working with IE it since it's so damn picky.
[19:39:51] <VioByte> IE since*
[19:43:24] <Es0teric> i have this $.ajax request for a form.. but its passing the serialized data as GET when the type is POST
[19:44:51] <rhizmoe> is there a jquery flipper that will display the outgoing/incoming content during rotation?
[19:46:17] <rhizmoe> Es0teric: have you tried type: 'POST' ?
[19:46:44] <Es0teric> rhizmoe yes
[19:47:10] <Es0teric> OH thats why its doing that
[19:47:10] <Es0teric> ok
[19:47:11] <Es0teric> i get it
[19:47:18] <Es0teric> its not parsing the PHP
[19:50:12] <Es0teric> what the hell? its still doing it
[19:51:17] <abc123> hi
[19:51:48] <Guest67416> ??
[19:51:59] <Guest67416> hi, everybody
[19:53:12] <Es0teric> rhizmoe
[19:56:27] <xp_prg> if I am using the tabbed interface, how can I know what tab is currently active?
[20:03:15] <Logikos> xp_prg: the one you click on
[20:03:28] <xp_prg> but programitcally
[20:03:36] <Logikos> well click is an event
[20:03:48] <Logikos> so when clicked set a class
[20:03:55] <xp_prg> chrome console says unrecognized expression: $("form[id$~='choose_type_type_frm choose_afftype_type_frm']");
[20:03:58] <Logikos> remove class from other tabs
[20:04:06] <Logikos> maybe call the class .activetab
[20:04:23] <xp_prg> I just thought there would be a global variable I could use
[20:04:28] <xp_prg> what is wrong with my selector?
[20:04:54] <Logikos> sorry, i'm not a js guru ... i know how to set an active tab .. but i dont have a clue whats wrong with your line of code...
[20:05:02] <systemfault> xp_prg: It doesn't exists
[20:05:12] <xp_prg> the forms do exist
[20:05:49] <systemfault> xp_prg: ~= and $= both exist
[20:05:59] <systemfault> But not $~=
[20:06:02] <xp_prg> this returns a form: $("form[id$='choose_type_type_frm']"); as well as this: $("form[id$='choose_afftype_type_frm']");
[20:06:02] <systemfault> AFAIK
[20:06:18] <xp_prg> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/
[20:06:35] <xp_prg> [att~=value] The attribute’s value needs to be a whitespace separated list of words (for example, class=”title featured home”), and one of the words is exactly the specified value.
[20:06:45] <systemfault> And?
[20:06:59] <xp_prg> and I am using that syntax but it is not working
[20:07:02] <systemfault> It's either ~= or $= , not both
[20:07:26] * xp_prg hides in intense embarassment
[20:07:45] <xp_prg> that was an imposter who asked that question, someone stole my nick ok?
[20:07:51] <systemfault> Cool
[20:08:07] <xp_prg> I just came back, hi, was someone typing here?
[20:08:12] <xp_prg> :>
[20:08:57] <xp_prg> my brain was in php land where all vars start with $
[20:09:06] <systemfault> PHP rots the mind :P
[20:09:16] <xp_prg> like if you say toast a bunch of time and someone asked you what you put in a toaster
[20:09:37] <Logikos> php rots the mind? if thats true it sure explains alot
[20:09:44] <Logikos> i cant seem to remember anything anymore .. except php
[20:09:45] <Logikos> lol
[20:09:47] <systemfault> :P
[20:14:28] * xp_prg hugs Logikos
[20:14:40] <xp_prg> don't be ashamed you can let your php'ness come out of the closet
[20:14:43] <xp_prg> your among friends now
[20:14:49] <xp_prg> your in a "safe" zone
[20:15:08] <Logikos> uhhh ... little to close man lol
[20:15:23] <Logikos> but.. i do code php .. and i am unashamed!
[20:15:25] <Logikos> lol
[20:15:45] <Logikos> wana get beter at js/jquery though
[20:15:47] <systemfault> Logikos: Well.. there are good PHP programmers, they're just rare..
[20:16:11] <Logikos> thats not a language thing, its a person thing
[20:16:18] <Logikos> there are good programers, they are just rare
[20:16:20] <Logikos> period
[20:16:45] <systemfault> Logikos: Sure.. but unfortunately, the fact that PHP is easy to learn makes it a mediocre programmer magnet
[20:16:57] * systemfault is working in a php shop.
[20:17:26] <Hawkee> heh, PHP is a mediocre programmer magnet, what about mIRC
[20:17:28] <Logikos> yeah, php can be light weight or hard core... most ppl i've seen code php just dabel .. i wouldnt call them programers really
[20:17:43] <Hawkee> I know a lot of mIRC coders and I wish they'd at least move on to PHP
[20:17:44] <Logikos> hey now, mIRC is where it all started (for me anyways)
[20:17:50] <systemfault> Hawkee: :P
[20:17:58] <systemfault> I started with TRS-80 Basic..
[20:18:10] <Hawkee> I started with BASIC on my Apple IIC
[20:18:14] <Logikos> i was 'thee' mIRC coder back in the day... and i should have moved on a lot earlier than i did
[20:18:15] <systemfault> :)
[20:18:28] <Hawkee> you release a scrip Logikos
[20:18:30] <Hawkee> ?
[20:18:38] <Logikos> nope, never released it
[20:18:46] <Hawkee> I had "the" mIRC script site back in the day
[20:18:50] <Logikos> but if you were huge into mIRC back then, you might have known me as Cobra^
[20:18:55] <Hawkee> actually, it still kinda is..
[20:19:13] <xp_prg> damn it to hell, can someone show me an example of this kind of approach as a selector: [att~=value]
[20:19:16] <Logikos> former founder of #mIRC on webchat and former beta tester
[20:19:17] <Logikos> lol
[20:19:27] <xp_prg> $("form[id~='choose_type_type_frm choose_afftype_type_frm']")
[20:19:31] <xp_prg> what is wrong with this?
[20:19:39] <Hawkee> doesn't sound familiar, I was big into the public script scene when it came to mIRC
[20:19:45] <xp_prg> this works: $("form[id$='choose_type_type_frm']")
[20:19:50] <Hawkee> I used to review tons of mIRC scripts
[20:20:02] <Hawkee> you remember CTFire or Xcalibre?
[20:20:07] <systemfault> xp_prg: It's "one" word
[20:20:14] <Logikos> yep, although i didnt use other ppls scripts
[20:20:28] <Hawkee> you remember my site?
[20:20:31] <Logikos> yep
[20:20:36] <systemfault> xp_prg: I guess you could use 2 attributes...
[20:20:38] <xp_prg> how do I make it two words besides using a chainsaw on my monitor right now?
[20:20:43] <systemfault> xp_prg: I haven't tried it though.
[20:20:45] <Hawkee> well, it's still going, but I'm trying to get more diverse coders
[20:20:48] <Logikos> i havent done mIRC scripting now for over 10 years lol
[20:21:10] <Hawkee> same here, last thing I did for mIRC was a centipede game back in 1998
[20:21:17] <Logikos> i made everything from port scaners to a chess game in mIRC
[20:21:18] <Hawkee> when picwins were brand new
[20:21:28] <Hawkee> my claim to fame was a "leech proof fserve"
[20:21:32] <Logikos> do you know Talon?
[20:21:38] <Hawkee> was the first one to incorporate a ratio
[20:21:43] <Logikos> he made a 3d rendering script in picwins lol
[20:21:55] <Logikos> he has a mIRC script rubicks cube you can move any which way
[20:21:56] <Logikos> lol
[20:21:57] <Hawkee> not sure, I generally forget handles after 10 years
[20:22:41] <Hawkee> I've seen some picwin coders move on to Processing
[20:22:52] <Hawkee> seems to be an easy transition
[20:23:14] <systemfault> xp_prg: Seriously.. what do you want to do?
[20:23:18] <Logikos> yeah
[20:23:53] <Hawkee> but even better is to transition to Obj-C or Java
[20:24:01] <xp_prg> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/
[20:24:02] <Logikos> i didnt go far in picwins .. cschess was the best i did in that, made a client/server chess game that allowed you to connect to a hosted games ip .. many could connect, you'd challenge eachother and play chess .. included text chat etc
[20:24:04] <Hawkee> that's where the young coders should be poking around
[20:24:13] <xp_prg> I want to use the ~= css attribute selector in jquery
[20:24:16] <Logikos> not much by todays standareds .. but back then ... lol
[20:24:22] <Hawkee> that sounds neat, I may have seen that script
[20:24:31] <xp_prg> but I want to match two form ids
[20:24:32] <Hawkee> you didn't post it anywhere?
[20:24:39] <Logikos> yeah, i didnt release it publicly on a site, but it got passed arround alot
[20:24:46] <systemfault> xp_prg: A node cannot have 2 ids...
[20:24:57] <Hawkee> I stopped using mIRC years ago
[20:25:05] <Logikos> i got the chess board and peice images from yahoo back then, if you recall what yahoo chess looked like in th elate '90's
[20:25:05] <Hawkee> ever since I stopped using Windows
[20:25:28] <Logikos> i'm useing mIRC right now just because i'm in windows .. i have dual boot and usualy i'm in linux
[20:25:32] <xp_prg> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/
[20:25:40] <xp_prg> this is what I want to do
[20:25:43] <Hawkee> I'm on X-Chat Aqua
[20:25:46] <Logikos> sadly i cant seem to do graphics in linux .. cant get the hang of gimp...
[20:25:51] <Logikos> i hate graphics anyways
[20:25:58] <systemfault> xp_prg: Then do it.. it's straightforward.
[20:26:06] <Hawkee> I went ahead and just bought Photoshop Elements
[20:26:15] <Hawkee> it's cheaper than the full thing and does everything I need
[20:26:28] <Aylham> Logikos: why not using pChat on Windows?
[20:26:35] <Hawkee> but I'm with you, I also hate doing graphics
[20:26:40] <Logikos> i'm not much into graphics but obviously in webdesign i need to do some graphics
[20:26:45] <Logikos> i always use paintshop pro
[20:26:46] <Hawkee> you have a site?
[20:26:51] <Logikos> not the new corel version though
[20:26:54] <Logikos> the older jase version
[20:27:01] <xp_prg> wait I think I know what I am doing wrong now
[20:27:04] <Logikos> hi tal
[20:27:10] <Talon_> hiya lol
[20:27:11] <Logikos> not live right now
[20:27:17] <Hawkee> working on one?
[20:27:22] <scr3am1> Logikos: what linux?
[20:27:30] <Logikos> hey tal, i was telling hawkee about your picwin 3d renderer
[20:27:33] <Hawkee> I just have my one site, just celebrated 15 years
[20:27:45] <systemfault> xp_prg: If you told me what you wanted to do instead of giving me a selector that I already understand how to use... it would be easier to help if you still need.
[20:27:45] <Logikos> scr3am1: mint
[20:27:54] <Logikos> cool
[20:28:02] <Logikos> i will be starting logikosministries.org soon
[20:28:06] <Hawkee> Talon_, you post your picwin thing anywhere?
[20:28:13] <Talon_> long time ago
[20:28:17] <Talon_> on mircscripts.org
[20:28:24] <Hawkee> what sort of ministry Logikos?
[20:28:31] <Hawkee> mirscripts.org is still hanging in there it seems
[20:28:41] <Logikos> makeing websites for churches and missionaries
[20:28:54] <Logikos> i've done several sites already
[20:28:58] <Logikos> just havent done mine lol
[20:29:03] <Hawkee> great, I help out with some of my church sites from time to time as well
[20:29:06] <systemfault> Logikos: Welcome to the club...
[20:29:13] <unseensoul> Hi
[20:29:14] <Logikos> great
[20:29:20] <Hawkee> its the best having your own site, especially when it pays the bills
[20:29:20] <systemfault> Logikos: I also need to write my own website..
[20:29:21] <Logikos> systemfault: which club?
[20:29:29] <Logikos> oh lol
[20:29:31] <Talon_> I had a 3d object renderer for a 1st attempt at 3d stuff, then I did more complex things with it such as a rubiks cube game, then I got into some fake 3D and made a raycaster that completely mimiced old original wolfenstein 3d's 1st level tho I never implemented doors, it did however do wall and sprite casting flawlessly.
[20:29:36] <Logikos> yeah, i've done many for others .. need to do mine
[20:29:37] <systemfault> Logikos: The club of web programmers without website.
[20:29:50] <Hawkee> very cool Talon_
[20:30:18] <Hawkee> I'm working on a sort of Google+/Twitter for coders
[20:30:32] <Hawkee> rather than post about the news you post about your code
[20:30:48] <systemfault> Hawkee: Hmm.. how is that any different than let's say... github?
[20:30:51] <Logikos> that'd be cool
[20:30:52] <Hawkee> been working on @mention autocomplete
[20:31:04] <xp_prg> ok figured it out
[20:31:14] <Hawkee> systemfault, github is more of a tool than a social hub
[20:31:15] <Talon_> http://talon.linux.sh/ray.png <== old sshot, the FPS is very low cause the window size is so huge, so when you got 800x600 thats 800 individual loops to find a vertical slice on a 2d grid lol, the smaller the window the better the performance, and that wasn't even counting for the sprite casting for objects and items.
[20:31:15] <xp_prg> I was just so confused it said a white space separated list of words
[20:31:21] <xp_prg> I thought that was what I supplied to it
[20:31:25] <xp_prg> but that is what it is searching
[20:31:42] <Hawkee> I'd actually like to incorporate github somehow
[20:31:47] <unseensoul> $('img').attr('src', 'www.example.com/image.jpg'); - Will jQuery stop at this point and wait until the image is loaded or will carry on to the next statement?
[20:32:03] <Hawkee> maybe offer a way to import projects
[20:32:03] <systemfault> xp_prg: Ah
[20:32:15] <systemfault> unseensoul: Carry on.
[20:32:20] <Talon_> so, you're the founder of hawkee.com?
[20:32:26] <Hawkee> Talon_, yes
[20:32:32] <Talon_> cool
[20:32:36] <Hawkee> heard of it?
[20:32:37] <unseensoul> systemfault, thanks.
[20:32:55] <systemfault> :)
[20:33:06] <Talon_> I visited it a couple of times but most the posts I seen were foreign, and I only knew english so I didn't browse very long.
[20:33:25] <Hawkee> when was that? everything is English
[20:34:08] <Talon_> heck it was so long ago I can't remember
[20:34:20] <Hawkee> systemfault, anyway my goal is to give developers a more human face to their users, github is very mechanical
[20:34:38] <systemfault> Hawkee: I agree
[20:34:50] <Hawkee> just like jeb_ uses Twitter to talk about his work on Minecraft
[20:35:04] <Logikos> what serverside web lang you useing hawkee?
[20:35:08] <Logikos> php, or some other?
[20:35:11] <Hawkee> PHP
[20:35:24] <Hawkee> but lately I've found myself doing more and more javascript/jQuery
[20:35:34] <systemfault> Javascript is fun :)
[20:35:38] <Talon_> hopefully still having similar tools tho Hawkee, I find myself git cloning a lot of projects to compile, I dislike those ones where you haveto download each and every file individually lol
[20:35:38] <Logikos> i wish i'd have goten into php earlier, i waisted way to much time in mIRC way back when...
[20:35:44] <Hawkee> gotta use javascript to stay modern in web development
[20:36:16] <Hawkee> git has its place, I'm not trying to replace it
[20:36:23] <Hawkee> if anything I'll just link to git repos
[20:36:46] <Logikos> yeah, i always avoided javascript .... but now i've seen the light
[20:36:47] <Logikos> lol
[20:36:51] <Hawkee> Logikos, heh, that's what I keep telling my users.. learn PHP, Java, anything! stop with the mIRC code
[20:36:51] <Logikos> so i'm trying to learn it
[20:36:54] <Hawkee> they don't listen though
[20:37:10] <Hawkee> they keep posting mIRC code
[20:37:13] <systemfault> Java is clearly a better choice to learn OOP
[20:37:22] <Logikos> mIRC scripting can be addicting
[20:37:27] <Logikos> untill you run out of ideas
[20:37:34] <Hawkee> Java is great for OOP, but PHP just has so much more support as a server side platform
[20:37:35] <Logikos> finaly i stoped after i had no more challenge....
[20:37:39] <systemfault> But PHP definitely get things done faster.
[20:37:51] <systemfault> Hawkee: Hmm.. What kind of support?
[20:37:59] <Hawkee> we have a great reason to learn Java now.. Android
[20:37:59] <Logikos> what a waist though .. i no longer even remember how to script mIRC
[20:38:07] <coldhead> waste*
[20:38:26] <Logikos> sorry, if that was to correct my spelling .. i dont spell
[20:38:30] <Hawkee> systemfault, support as far as scripts, plugins, mods, snippets, solutions
[20:38:38] <Logikos> so if your gonna try to keep up with my mistakes you have a big job ahead of you
[20:38:45] <Hawkee> if anybody wants to start a fresh site I usually suggest just going with Wordpress
[20:38:49] <systemfault> Hawkee: Hmm... Seems you're not familiar with the Java ecosystem...
[20:38:55] <Hawkee> and just use mods to make it do custom things
[20:38:58] <Hawkee> so much support
[20:39:00] <Talon_> I'm a perl junkie myself, I've tried to move to php but i just get frustrated with some limitations that I'm so used to doing with perl, and they both are more than capable of doing the same thing. I don't flame php devs but I can still do what they do with perl :)
[20:39:27] <Hawkee> systemfault, not so much.. I've only done a single Android app and have never done server side Java
[20:39:48] <Hawkee> Talon_, I'll be happy if I never do perl again :)
[20:39:56] <Aylham> personnaly waiting B2G
[20:39:56] <Hawkee> I did perl for years early on
[20:40:01] <Hawkee> my site was originally done in perl
[20:40:07] <systemfault> Hawkee: The amount of tools is crazy in java.. Frameworks that PHP can only dream of etc...
[20:40:24] <systemfault> Hawkee: Symfony2 is nice though for a PHP framework
[20:40:27] <coldhead> this is all very tedious
[20:40:36] <Cstdenis> I am trying to use ajaxSetup() to set my CRSF token in the post data of all forms. This seems to work fine for queries that have data: set, but for ones where data is "" it does not work.
[20:40:37] <Cstdenis> I have tried 2 different methods for this and neither work correctly. Method 1 just sets data parameter in ajaxsetup. Method 2 use beforeSend() to change/set the data.
[20:40:40] <Hawkee> systemfault, don't know that one.. I'll have to check it out
[20:40:41] <Cstdenis> In the case of method 2, chrome's developer tools show the data as "request payload" instead of "form data"
[20:40:43] <Cstdenis> Pastebin with code segments: http://pastebin.com/NED743D3
[20:41:08] <Hawkee> anybody ever use Sphinx Search?
[20:41:15] <Hawkee> it's a fulltext engine, very cool
[20:41:31] <Hawkee> they have a plugin for mySQL that lets you query the engine through mySQL
[20:41:38] <slb_> i have a non modal dialog, is there a way i can perform a post and have it post to that dialog without using an ajax post
[20:41:57] <systemfault> Hawkee: I heard good things about it, never used it though
[20:42:11] <Hawkee> I started using it last year, just love it
[20:42:31] <Hawkee> jQuery autocomplete + Sphinx Search = *drool*
[20:42:42] <Hawkee> you can pull off some really snappy search results
[20:42:59] <coldhead> Cstdenis: in my mind, the CSRF token is a part of the form, not of the ajax request. i would replace serialize() with myOwnSerialize() which serializes AND adds the CSRF stuff
[20:43:06] <systemfault> Hawkee: Is it another software based of Lucene?
[20:43:11] <slb_> i thought sphinx was only best for full text searches
[20:43:27] <Hawkee> it's separate from Lucene, same type of software but totally different codebase
[20:43:32] <slb_> i suppose thats what u would use with an autocomplete
[20:43:41] <Hawkee> I considered Lucene as well, but it didn't have a mySQL plugin
[20:43:49] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[20:43:50] <slb_> postgresql++
[20:44:18] <systemfault> slb_: I will try it one day... I'm just used to mysql
[20:44:19] <Hawkee> sphinx is really fast with any type of search, even a simple wildcard exact match
[20:44:28] <systemfault> (And I'm not a DB guy...)
[20:44:35] <slb_> postgres has some nice features
[20:44:43] <Hawkee> so you can get some snappy dynamic autocomplete lists with sphinx
[20:45:04] <Talon_> are there any half-decent jquery tutorial sites? I've looked at the ones on w3schools.com I've followed javascript since before I ever even knew about IRC, I remember doing things in old original netscape navigator. I still tend to do oop-style JS with functions for various things I want to do with JS and can do them, but from what i've read jquery is supposed to help take the guesswork out of
[20:45:04] <Talon_> cross-browser compatibility.
[20:45:13] <Cstdenis> coldhead: the serialize() is just added by the framework (Yii) if I don't set anything for data. In this case there is no underlying form so the value of data in that query ends up being "". This is fine, but using ajaxSetup() to set the CSRF breaks when .ajax() sets data to ""
[20:45:26] <Hawkee> I've heard a lot of good things about postgresql
[20:45:34] <Hawkee> but I haven't had a need to switch from mySQL yet
[20:45:47] <slb_> sqlite is fabulous for lightweight stuff also
[20:45:59] <Hawkee> Talon_, I always end up at stackoverflow for jquery solutions
[20:46:13] <Hawkee> ah yes, I use sqlite for my Android app
[20:46:21] <Hawkee> pretty neat little engine, so small
[20:46:25] <slb_> yea
[20:46:27] <slb_> it is quite nice
[20:46:41] <slb_> have u done much droid development?
[20:46:48] <Hawkee> not a ton
[20:46:50] <slb_> i know java pretty well and have read a few of the docs
[20:46:55] <Hawkee> I have an app out there called "App Inbox"
[20:47:15] <Hawkee> you subscribe to keyword searches and categories and it delivers app results
[20:47:16] <slb_> the sdk looks pretty freakin robust
[20:47:23] <Cstdenis> I've been using postgresql for years now. It's much more powerful than mysql and in my experience more relible, but also more work to tweak/optimize and requires some heavier hardware because of the overhead associated with the better data integrety
[20:47:34] <slb_> i love the custom datatypes in postgres
[20:47:40] <slb_> bloody handy
[20:47:43] <Talon_> I spent a little bit of time making a progress-bar web-upload using multi-part form data and ajax, when it was all done and working, I come to find that the XMLHttpRequest object methods I was using to display percentage of the uploads was only supported by firefox, and that just dissapointed me to no end lol.
[20:48:15] <Hawkee> I've spent the past several years just learning how to tweak/optimize mySQL.. I can't imagine "more work" to optimize postgresql
[20:48:25] <systemfault> I hate DBs :P
[20:48:36] <Hawkee> I love dbs
[20:48:46] <slb_> if your model is f'd it doesnt matter what engine you use
[20:48:47] <Hawkee> I don't know what it is about them, just dealing with tons of data
[20:49:05] <Hawkee> slb_, so true..
[20:49:06] <Cstdenis> Probably not more work in the long run, but a somewhat higher learning curve
[20:49:28] <slb_> the function scripting is sweet
[20:49:37] <slb_> different langs
[20:49:44] <slb_> another big plus in my opinion
[20:49:55] <Cstdenis> pluggable languages.
[20:49:57] <Hawkee> there have been a couple cases over the years where that might have come in handy
[20:50:04] <Hawkee> but I usually just do all that in PHP
[20:51:07] <Talon_> Hawkee: http://www.mircscripts.org/comments.php?cid=2852 <== ancient renderer, my 1st attempt at 3D calculations, back face culling, sorting objects by distance for render order, etc.. finally found it lol.
[20:51:47] <anphonic> Has anyone had any exp with wunderground's API ?
[20:51:52] <Hawkee> doesn't look like there's a postgresql plugin for sphinx, that would be the deal breaker for me
[20:52:27] <Hawkee> Talon_, nice, you do all the matrix multiplication?
[20:52:34] <Talon_> anphonic: I'd be curious about that, I think weather.com now wants money for their weather api
[20:52:56] <Hawkee> I did a little 3D stuff with glut years ago
[20:53:03] <Hawkee> that was fun
[20:53:07] <Talon_> Hawkee: yeah, it uses the same 4x4 matrices as openGL even tho the last one is pretty much useless
[20:53:30] <anphonic> Talon_: wunderground does too a key, but not as much and you get a decent amount of requests with the dev api
[20:53:54] <Hawkee> I took a 3D class in college, made an ocean simulator
[20:54:08] <Talon_> I just cheat with weather.com by parsing their rss feeds.
[20:54:09] <Hawkee> you could control the choppiness of the waves
[20:54:16] <Hawkee> and it had clouds floating over head
[20:54:21] <anphonic> I have to figure out how to get this to work with a user submitted url
[20:54:42] <Talon_> your own engine or part of some dev tool like lightwave or something using dx or opengl?
[20:54:48] <anphonic> ah I 'd love to do that but the boss... oh the boss... it's not "pretty" or "poppy" enough lol
[20:55:17] <anphonic> Hawkee: That's over my head, literally lol
[20:55:17] <Hawkee> I used OpenGL
[20:55:49] <Hawkee> so it wasn't too difficult I don't think
[20:55:54] <Talon_> the funny thing is I understand the math behind it, yet I can't for the life of me grasp openGL. I've tried.
[20:56:02] <Hawkee> I also made a little 1st person adventure demo
[20:56:10] <Hawkee> had trees and a cabin to walk around
[20:56:11] <anphonic> ^_^
[20:57:28] <Hawkee> here's my ocean app: http://www.hawkee.com/profile/img/2115/
[20:57:33] <Hawkee> and the game: http://www.hawkee.com/profile/img/2112/
[20:57:37] <Hawkee> they might still run
[20:58:10] <cesaro> can you delcare two fancyboxes in different parts of the same code and acutally epxect it to work.
[20:58:16] <cesaro> it seems to unexplicably not load
[20:58:17] <systemfault> Hawkee: Oh noes, not MFC :P
[20:58:25] <Hawkee> hahah, yes MFC :)
[20:58:35] <Hawkee> and I used DirectX for sound
[20:58:35] <Talon_> that is pretty sweet
[20:58:41] <systemfault> :D
[20:59:18] <Hawkee> I remember it was getting toward the end of the term on that game so I hard coded all the collision boxes
[20:59:23] <Hawkee> I felt so dirty
[20:59:28] <anphonic> lol
[20:59:39] <Talon_> I never did try mfc. I wound up writing a wrapper class to windows api to mimic mIRC dialogs and events.
[20:59:55] <Hawkee> I think I bought a book on MFC, I thought it was really cool at the time
[20:59:58] <systemfault> MFC was ugly as hell..
[21:00:06] <systemfault> I prefered classic win32
[21:00:12] <systemfault> Even though I was using C++
[21:00:13] <anphonic> Y'all, Talon_ and Hawkee, make my programming ability feel kindergartnerish lol
[21:00:38] <Hawkee> anphonic, I don't even do this sort of thing.. these were class projects
[21:00:54] <anphonic> of course, I'm trying to combined java, javascript, php, asp.net, cobol and whatever else gets thrown at me
[21:00:56] <anphonic> lol
[21:00:57] <Hawkee> I went into web development thinking I'll take the easy way out, game dev was too tough
[21:01:14] <Talon_> lol its just a hobby for me, I dabble in anything that interests me. as of late, most of my time is spent in C++ using the QT Framework cause so far its the best cross-platform framework I've used. I can't stand others like gtk+ or wxWidgets.
[21:01:31] <anphonic> <-- just did the same thing
[21:01:36] <anphonic> but from programming to web dev
[21:01:45] <systemfault> Talon_: I agree with you :)
[21:01:52] <Hawkee> I remember thinking web dev is such a low brow form of development
[21:02:00] <Hawkee> this was 10 years ago
[21:02:03] <systemfault> I'm a c++ addict.. converted to web dev..
[21:02:22] <Hawkee> I felt like a failure because I didn't get into desktop application development
[21:02:24] <systemfault> Hawkee: I remember thinking that about front-end dev.
[21:02:33] <systemfault> Not backend.
[21:02:36] <anphonic> I do the same thing Talon_, but between honeydo's, work, class and etc
[21:02:39] <anphonic> I have no tome
[21:02:41] <anphonic> time*
[21:02:59] <anphonic> Hell, Been working on a degree since 99 lol
[21:03:00] <Hawkee> systemfault, heh.. well front end is more fun
[21:03:06] <anphonic> ^^
[21:03:15] <systemfault> Hawkee: It's getting fun these days...
[21:03:20] <systemfault> It used to be hellish
[21:03:22] <systemfault> IMHO.
[21:03:32] <Hawkee> jQuery makes front end dev a joy
[21:03:39] <slb_> jquery is a blessing
[21:03:41] <Talon_> hah, now everything is entirely web-oriented. I dunno if it still is but even programs like VMWare used a pseudo httpd to serve configuration pages and launch your virtual machines. Most of these IRC networks I'm on now have almost removed all client commands and replaced it with a web-panel interface.
[21:03:44] <systemfault> Not having to support IE6 too..
[21:03:52] <Hawkee> although this latest challenge had me working hard
[21:04:05] <Hawkee> just implemented @mention autocomplete like facebook/twitter/google+
[21:04:21] <systemfault> :)
[21:04:22] <anphonic> I'll be glad to get rid of IE <9
[21:04:42] <Hawkee> might be a while anphonic.. XP doesn't support IE 9
[21:04:52] <anphonic> I know :(
[21:04:56] <Hawkee> but I can see Chrome taking over all those old XP machines
[21:04:59] <systemfault> Hawkee: Well.. XP will die... one day..
[21:05:03] <Talon_> I gave up on supporting any version of IE, that was always a nightmare. I concentrate mainly on firefox/chrome/opera.
[21:05:06] <anphonic> hence we still build to IE 8 at a min
[21:05:09] <systemfault> Hawkee: EOL is April 8th 2014
[21:05:29] <Hawkee> fortunately my users are mainly coders so IE is the smallest piece of the pie
[21:05:41] <systemfault> :)
[21:05:48] <Talon_> but then again its a hobby, if I had a contract for a website I can see why a client would want backwards compatibility for older browsers.
[21:05:51] <Hawkee> I don't even like to boot up Windows to test IE 8
[21:06:07] <systemfault> Hawkee: I have a vm for that :/
[21:06:11] <anphonic> we're watching IE drop on all of our sites too, down to ~14% overall
[21:06:33] <Talon_> what do you run Hawkee?
[21:06:41] <Hawkee> I *had* a VM, but then VMware decided I need to buy it again to make it work on Lion, *sigh*
[21:06:47] <Hawkee> OS X Lion
[21:06:50] <systemfault> Hawkee: Sucks :(
[21:07:22] <Hawkee> so now I just use Bootcamp
[21:07:46] <Talon_> always wanted to try mac. I run debian wheezy/sid and trying to get accustomed to gnome shell, shell extensions are kinda cool but it's still really incomplete to be a good desktop environment.
[21:08:12] <systemfault> OSX is the best :P
[21:08:21] <slb_> oh god im going to faint
[21:08:22] <Hawkee> yeah, 14% IE here as well
[21:08:29] <systemfault> A unix shell.. with proprietary software support..
[21:08:30] <anphonic> <-- runs the red headed stepchild :(
[21:08:40] <Hawkee> 41% IE9, 47% IE8
[21:08:56] <Hawkee> so more like 7% without real CSS
[21:09:14] <Hawkee> I use CentOS on my servers
[21:09:23] <systemfault> Debian here..
[21:09:29] <slb_> do you use plesk
[21:09:30] <Hawkee> used to use RHE
[21:09:37] <slb_> very common on centos vd's
[21:09:38] <anphonic> plesk... :P
[21:09:43] <Hawkee> and I used to use cPanel, happy to be done with that
[21:09:47] <slb_> plesk is horrid
[21:09:55] <Hawkee> I'm bare bones now
[21:10:03] <anphonic> our servers use directAdmin and cpanel
[21:10:06] <slb_> hope u all that use plesk patched that big security bug
[21:10:09] <anphonic> DA sucks too
[21:10:16] <slb_> directadmin lots of security problems
[21:10:23] <Hawkee> I hesitated to drop cpanel for several years
[21:10:28] <Hawkee> so happy I did
[21:10:43] <slb_> what host co do u use
[21:10:51] <Hawkee> now I just yum yum yum
[21:10:53] <Talon_> Hawkee: you should give virtualbox a try, I switched to it from VMWare. It's actaully really nice now in these latter builds, tho I do have support for IOMMU but I can't seem to get attached devices working properly on the VM, they crash my vm, but I'm sure it will be fixed eventually. Aero runs perfectly on my w7 VM. I'm a sucker for effects lol, I stuck with VMWare until VirtualBox finally
[21:10:53] <Talon_> got flaky 3D support :)
[21:11:11] <anphonic> WHM is nice, being able to restart services from the menu, without having to hunt
[21:11:26] <Hawkee> Talon_, I'll check it out.. how's the cost?
[21:11:31] <Talon_> free
[21:11:49] <Hawkee> anphonic, "service mysqld restart", "service httpd restart"? easy enough :)
[21:11:58] <anphonic> lol, true
[21:12:01] <Hawkee> that's the best cost
[21:12:07] <anphonic> but scroll, click, done
[21:12:32] <Hawkee> I prefer to minimize my clicking
[21:12:38] <Hawkee> the more I can do with my keyboard the better
[21:12:45] <Hawkee> that's why I still use vim
[21:12:58] <systemfault> I love vim :P
[21:13:08] <Hawkee> I absolutely love macvim
[21:13:12] <Talon_> the side-by-side comparisons, VMWare beats Virtualbox in most cases, but the winning margin is so minimal, unless you really need EXTREME performance, I think virtualbox is more friendly and just as good.
[21:13:14] <systemfault> I use an IDE when I need to deal with larg applications though..
[21:13:23] <Hawkee> I'm still learning new commands in vim after 10+ years
[21:13:24] <anphonic> boss calls me a "click-a-holic" cause when he's in there ranting about something, I'm trying to follow his topic and click on what he's going off about
[21:13:25] <systemfault> Talon_: Not on mac..
[21:13:34] <systemfault> Talon_: Vmware fusion is lightyears ahead.
[21:13:42] <slb_> vmware has serious money behind it
[21:13:49] <Hawkee> Talon_, well the side by side cost comparison is what matters to me.. I only need windows to check IE
[21:13:53] <systemfault> But on linux.. and windows, vmware or virtualbox are pretty much the same.
[21:14:08] * anphonic sighs
[21:14:26] <systemfault> Hawkee: Then vbox should be enough.
[21:14:33] <Talon_> Xen is another one but I've never heard much about it or even used it.
[21:14:35] <Hawkee> we'll see how it runs on OS X
[21:14:37] <anphonic> well, gotta get back to making this thing pretty
[21:14:41] <Hawkee> downloading it now
[21:14:51] <systemfault> Talon_: Too low level..
[21:15:07] <Hawkee> systemfault, you know the > and == commands in vim?
[21:15:19] <systemfault> Hawkee: > is indent, no?
[21:15:24] <Hawkee> yes
[21:15:26] <systemfault> == is format?
[21:15:36] <Hawkee> believe it or not I just learned that > indent command the other day..
[21:15:38] <systemfault> gg=G is format the whole file ;)
[21:15:42] <Hawkee> I've always used ==
[21:15:51] <Hawkee> but sometimes > is what I need
[21:15:55] <systemfault> Right :P
[21:16:19] <Hawkee> neat, didn't know gg=G
[21:16:29] <Hawkee> but sometimes that doesn't do things right
[21:17:03] <systemfault> Right.. that's why I only use it on files with messed up formating..
[21:17:10] <Hawkee> I just love command mode
[21:17:25] <Hawkee> dd, p, J
[21:17:35] <systemfault> My fingers are still often moving to the arrow keys..
[21:17:36] <systemfault> :(
[21:17:45] <systemfault> I should always use hjkl
[21:18:01] <Hawkee> yeah, I use the arrows as well
[21:18:07] <Hawkee> I think that's fine
[21:18:15] <Hawkee> because I still do use normal editors from time to time
[21:18:27] <Hawkee> I already hit esc all the time in those
[21:18:38] <Hawkee> don't need to be seeing hjkl all over
[21:18:59] <systemfault> I remapped capslock to esc
[21:19:02] <systemfault> Works well
[21:19:19] <systemfault> esc is a bit far on the keyboard
[21:19:38] <Hawkee> I reach for esc with my middle finger, seems like a good reach
[21:19:44] <Hawkee> don't need to move my palm
[21:19:50] <Hawkee> my pinky gets too much of a workout anyway
[21:19:56] <Hawkee> holding shift all the time
[21:21:42] <Hawkee> installing this virtual box
[21:21:49] <systemfault> :P
[21:23:17] <Hawkee> need to go dig up my XP install disk
[21:24:03] <Hawkee> all for those poor 7% of my visitors who are still on IE8
[21:24:34] <arlink> http://pastebin.com/1KRYsquq will console.log() output all the data inside project?
[21:25:48] <Hawkee> arlink, it should.. give it a try
[21:26:02] <Aylham> $('#t[i]') syntax error in a for loop, but dont find an example on the net ><
[21:48:17] * anphonic celebrates in his greate success!
[21:48:55] <anphonic> ok, so not so great but for holding on to the tip of a long tiger tail?
[21:51:20] <Aylham> gg anphonic
[21:54:07] <Aylham> I fail to use the increment of a for loop as a part of a class anyone can help me? :$
[21:55:05] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:55:07] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[21:55:15] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[21:55:16] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[21:56:30] <Aylham> for (var i=0;i<8;i++)  {
[21:56:30] <Aylham> $('#t1').find('h1').empty(); }; would replace #t1 by #t[i]
[21:57:07] <Nomikos> what fires first, a blur or a change event? and is that for all browsers?
[21:58:12] <Aylham> after a click event but the event is working well just a error in my sintax I think
[21:58:35] <Eviltwin> Nomikos: Pretty sure it's universally blur before change
[21:58:47] <Nomikos> thanks
[21:59:04] <Eviltwin> Nomikos: Usually they go in order first by what happens chronologically then the most "primative" first
[21:59:55] <Nomikos> Hm, makes sense I guess, you can't have a change event without a blur having happened
[22:02:25] <Eviltwin> Yup
[22:02:34] <Eviltwin> That's the idea
[22:08:02] <Aylham> i have some css classe #t1
[22:08:15] <Nomikos> (that's an id, not a class)
[22:08:48] <Aylham> i know typing mistake enter instead of backspace :/
[22:09:09] <Nomikos> np, just sayin' :-)
[22:10:31] <Aylham> so have some ids #t1 to #t8, want to loop the number but I miserably fail it :/ tried $(t.[i])  in a for loop with i as increment
[22:10:51] <Aylham> miss the good syntax :/
[22:12:43] <Aylham> there is some online bible for JS where I can found an awesome tuto with examples or stuff like that?
[22:12:50] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Aylham
[22:12:51] <bot-t> Aylham, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:12:52] <Eviltwin> Many
[22:13:04] <Nomikos> for(i..) ${'#t'+i) should work
[22:13:15] <Nomikos> ehr, scratchs that {, that's an (
[22:14:55] <Aylham> its working thx Nomikos
[22:15:10] <Nomikos> Aylham: in $('#t1'), the '#t1' part is just a string that you can manipulate before jQuery takes over (where string indeed falls under basic JS, but this can be confusing at first :-)
[22:16:01] <Aylham> And thx too Eviltwin didnt have time to really study before my coursework deadline, will study deeply after it :)
[22:16:14] <Eviltwin> What course?
[22:16:51] <Aylham> Beng Computer System and Networks, but have a Web Technologie module
[22:21:58] <anphonic> argh!! just when I think I have a handle on pulling values out of this json string...
[22:24:06] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to pull values out of a JSON string?
[22:24:18] <Nomikos> I think he does mean object
[22:24:27] <Eviltwin> I really hope so
[22:24:39] <anphonic> haha yeah
[22:24:45] <muzone> Eviltwin: hey man
[22:24:57] <muzone> i havent forgotten about you!
[22:24:59] <anphonic> getting hard to type, eyes crossed
[22:25:13] <Eviltwin> muzone: What does that mean?
[22:25:17] <muzone> *just know that*
[22:25:46] <muzone> it means this week or the next, but this time for real
[22:25:51] <muzone> come on
[22:25:56] <muzone> we're just talking petty change
[22:26:05] <muzone> its no big deal, right?
[22:26:25] <Eviltwin> I suppose it depends on your definition of petty change
[22:26:32] <Eviltwin> And that fact that you're like 3 months late on delivery
[22:26:42] <muzone> hehe
[22:26:50] <muzone> well 50 dollars
[22:26:59] <muzone> i got my application approved
[22:27:04] <Eviltwin> Congratulations
[22:27:10] <muzone> since im having my tumor removed next month
[22:27:47] <muzone> yeah its cool. its been occupying half of my frontal lobe all my life. getting it removed is most likely gonna make me a new person
[22:28:13] <Nomikos> better backup your passwords
[22:28:15] <muzone> no doubt though im gonna remain poor until i launch my app (which u helped me make)
[22:28:33] <muzone> but at least the state will help me provide for my livelihood due to this thing
[22:28:36] <muzone> Nomikos: haha
[22:28:50] <muzone> man i most certainly will
[22:29:08] <muzone> i just hope i remember y'all after i wake up
[22:29:30] <anonym00se> I'm having an issue binding a function to my form submit event when it is nested inside of colorbox modal window, does any one have experience with submitting forms asynchronously in colorbox windows (using the jquery colorbox plugin)
[22:29:32] <muzone> y'all should have seen the thing its fucking huge, been squeezing half of my brain all my life, theres no telling how it's changed me
[22:29:38] <anonym00se> also hello all o/
[22:30:01] <mikkelb> muzone: how about u show us who u are now
[22:30:10] <mikkelb> and then u do the same thing after the op
[22:30:13] <mikkelb> and we can compare
[22:30:32] <muzone> alright man that sounds fair enough!
[22:30:41] <anphonic> so, http://jsfiddle.net/JMr98/ i have that json object (thats just partial) how would i pull each perion "day" out ?
[22:31:09] <anonym00se> hmm maybe my question should be rephrased
[22:31:23] <anonym00se> is there any way to reinistialize bound events on an event trigger?
[22:31:32] <aqeel> hi room
[22:31:37] <mikkelb> muzone: so?

[22:32:12] <anonym00se> halp
[22:33:11] <mikkelb> anonym00se: not now
[22:34:02] <anonym00se> lol
[22:34:10] <anonym00se> is it a bad time
[22:34:14] <anonym00se> got a lady friend over?
[22:35:59] <Nomikos> x = forecast.txt_forecast.forecastday, which is an array of objects, so you'd run through that with say, for(i=0;..) x[i].period
[22:36:04] <Nomikos> anphonic: ^
[22:36:26] <Nomikos> assuming forecast is the name of the JSON object, and not part of it
[22:36:56] <Nomikos> Then it'd be jsonobject.forecast.etc
[22:37:34] <mikkelb> anonym00se: no listening to muzone
[22:37:40] <mikkelb> anonym00se: ladyfriend is sleeping
[22:37:56] <anonym00se> heh, k :)
[22:39:31] <anphonic> Nomikos: ty
[22:40:27] * Nomikos points gid0_ at jsfiddle
[22:41:33] <aqeel> how is everyone
[22:47:41] <Nomikos> what the hell?
[22:48:06] <Nomikos> wtf's going on, anyone?
[22:48:38] <foo> is there a way to compare two jsfiddles together? can't seem to figure it out for the life of me.
[22:48:43] <foo> (and I thought someone did this to me in the past)
[22:50:37] <coolfactor> DeLorean731 isn't getting a clue here
[22:50:43] <Nomikos>  /ignore ftw
[22:51:22] <Nomikos> There were so many at the same time though, strange
[22:52:06] <coolfactor> @Delorean731, what happened?
[22:54:02] <Nomikos> http://paste.ubuntu.com/881483/ spot the common factor
[22:55:54] <Nomikos> dr0id: I'm pretty sure I remember you being a human, any idea what caused these excess floods?
[22:56:11] <gf3> must be some Freenode thing
[22:56:19] <gf3> I was disconnected as well
[22:56:26] <dr0id> skynet
[22:56:32] <gf3> fuuuuuuu-
[22:56:36] * Nomikos takes off his tinfoil hat again
[22:57:08] <gf3> remysharp: ohai
[22:57:18] <gf3> remysharp: Y U NO -ot?
[23:00:36] <foo> Any reason why this doesn't work? It's not showing me what I want http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/
[23:02:13] <Nomikos> eval only takes & runs complete statements, you can't use it as part of one
[23:02:13] <caniuse> Nomikos: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[23:02:24] <Nomikos> that too :-p
[23:03:49] <Nomikos> foo: on the last line you're "running" thisName, which is not returning anything, therefor nothing is printed either. TL;DR: don't use eval(), there's always a better way
[23:03:59] <foo> Nomikos: http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/1/
[23:04:01] <foo> Nomikos: ahhh
[23:04:08] <Nomikos> (In javascript much more so than in PHP fwiw)
[23:04:19] <foo> Nomikos: haha, yeah, PHP is bad.
[23:04:28] <foo> Nomikos: Open to a better way if you see what I'm trying to do
[23:05:24] <Nomikos> foo: instead of a variable, can you use an object with a property 'thisName' ?
[23:06:18] <foo> Nomikos: hm, can you code out how that might look? Sorry, not too familiar with javascript OOP
[23:06:19] <Nomikos> then you could just do test = "thisName"; Obj[test] = "show me this"; etc
[23:06:27] <foo> Nomikos: that might work, hmm.
[23:07:11] * Nomikos plays a professional JS dev on TV
[23:08:04] <foo> Nomikos: hmm, was that for me? :)
[23:08:13] <Nomikos> ignore that :)
[23:08:18] <foo> Nomikos: oh ok :)
[23:08:46] <Nomikos> foo: notice there's a subtle (or actually, not so subtle) difference between obj[test] and obj['test']
[23:09:20] <Nomikos> obj[test] is the same as obj['thisName'], which is the same as obj.thisName
[23:09:21] <foo> Nomikos: I hate to be a beggar, but a working jsfiddle of this will make things click faster for me :) Been trying to tackle this for the past hour and it's driving me crazy, hah.
[23:09:43] * Nomikos copy/pastes the irc screen into jsfiddle :p
[23:09:59] <foo> Nomikos: thanks a ton, appreciate this
[23:12:14] <Nomikos> I must be way off, can't get that to run
[23:12:44] <foo> Nomikos: hmm, strange
[23:13:10] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/2/ that should work
[23:13:24] <Nomikos> Yeah, it looks better on tv
[23:14:25] <Nomikos> Forgot you can't just go assigning properties to objects like foo.bar = ''  without telling JS it's an object first.
[23:15:49] <foo> Nomikos: Hm, the reason "thisName" was an element in an array test, was because we might add more to this. Can we do that with this set up?
[23:17:54] <Nomikos> foo: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/3/
[23:27:09] <foo> Nomikos: why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/6/
[23:28:05] <Cork> foo: your setting array values on undefined object members
[23:28:45] <foo> Cork: I want Obj.test[0] = "show me this" to equate to Obj.thisName="show me this";
[23:29:04] <Nomikos> Obj[test[0]] = 'that thing'
[23:29:15] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/7/
[23:29:46] <Nomikos> Obj.test wasn't defined yet, so you can't go adding items to it. Obj[test] != Obj.test
[23:30:11] <Cork> ah, sorry i miss understood a bit
[23:31:09] <Cork> foo: is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/uMDBx/8/
[23:32:06] <foo> Cork / Nomikos - yes, thanks, I think this is it. /implementing into larger code base now
[23:32:27] <Nomikos> gl,hf :)
