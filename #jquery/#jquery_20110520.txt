[00:14:28] <blkcat> hey guys, quick question from a jquery newbie - i've got a link element running a subroutine when it's clicked. how can i pass that element into the subroutine?
[00:14:57] <Murugaratham> this
[00:15:15] <blkcat> javascript:foo( this )?
[00:15:23] <blkcat> i tried that but it gave me some crazy domwindow object, haha
[00:15:37] <Murugaratham> can show me wat u have done?
[00:15:49] <blkcat> do you mind a pm?
[00:18:12] <Murugaratham> pastebin?
[00:25:55] <intellilogic> hello
[00:29:55] <ngharo> is it just me or does anyone else see those accented A's in topic
[00:30:03] <ngharo> prolly lack of utf8 on my part or something
[00:30:50] <Lunders> morning everyone, anyone know why Im getting a undefined error? http://lundy.me.uk/GFA/datePicker/datepickBasic.html
[00:32:54] <ngharo> you want .datepick()
[00:34:30] <Lunders> poo connection :(
[00:34:31] <Lunders> morning everyone, anyone know why Im getting a undefined error? http://lundy.me.uk/GFA/datePicker/datepickBasic.html
[00:35:03] <ngharo> you want .datepick()
[00:35:36] <Lunders> :)
[00:36:50] <Lunders> ngharo: doesnt add on 3 days though
[00:36:56] <Lunders> all the functions messed up?
[00:40:21] <ngharo> sorry Lunders i need my beauty sleep
[00:49:21] <bumba82> I guys, I know this is not the channel for jquery mobile, but there is much more people connected here ... Anyone that can help me with jqm?
[00:52:55] <coldhead> go ahead and ask your question, bumba82
[00:53:04] <coldhead> and see if anyone jumps in
[00:54:17] <bittyx-laptop> if i want to do something only if an element exists on the page, is it enough to just do: if ($('#elementID')) { bla bla; }
[00:54:43] <coldhead> if ($('#el').length)
[00:54:55] <coldhead> because even $('doesnotexist') is true
[00:56:14] <bittyx-laptop> ah, okay, thanks. and for stuff where i do something like $('#elementID').click( ... ), if that element doesn't exist, it won't throw any errors right? because i'd like to use one .js file for most of the (front-end) pages, and obviously not all of them have all the elements
[00:57:25] <coldhead> yes that will safely have no effect
[00:57:37] <bittyx-laptop> cool, thanks for the info
[00:57:43] <dr0id> Hello
[00:57:52] <coldhead> hey dr0id
[00:57:58] <coldhead> no more lsthemes!
[00:57:59] <dr0id> heyo :)
[00:58:01] <dr0id> LOL
[00:58:30] <bittyx-laptop> hiya dr0id
[00:58:32] <dr0id> .seen lsthemes
[00:58:33] <hsbot> lsthemes was seen 2 days, 23 hours and 19 minutes ago, joining #jquery
[00:58:53] <dr0id> pauper bot
[00:58:58] <bittyx-laptop> okay, another question - i have this (simple) slideshow on http://nsnight.levacic.net/
[00:59:27] <dr0id> yeah, quite simple
[00:59:30] <dr0id> skylamer: yo
[00:59:32] <bittyx-laptop> when i open firebug and look at the HTML, each time the slide is triggered by the timer, i get for new divs with class .ui-effects-wrapper
[00:59:35] <anli_> I want to store some values across page loads, is using window.name still the way to go?
[00:59:44] <bittyx-laptop> s/for new divs/four new divs/
[00:59:44] <anli_> I want to keep some non string data as well
[01:00:02] <bittyx-laptop> is this normal, and can it lead to problems? they just keep replicating all the time...
[01:00:06] <bittyx-laptop> or am i doing something wrong?
[01:00:50] <dr0id> it could be better and faster. regenerating the divs, a's everytime seems not so good
[01:00:55] <dr0id> look at some other simple sliders.
[01:02:12] <bumba82> ok
[01:02:43] <bumba82> local images (bundled with the app) are not displayed anymore, remote ones work as usual ...
[01:02:58] <bumba82> it seems related to the wrong path generated by jquery mobile ...
[01:03:13] <bittyx-laptop> dr0id: okay, i'll search for some other sliders, but i have this same behavior in another page: http://nsnight.levacic.net/dogadjaji <--- in the two top boxes labeled "Vrsta dogadjaja" and "Vrsta muzike", if you click on all the little tags, the events listed below get filtered. now, every time a filter is actually activated (when some events need to be hidden/shown), i'm still getting new divs. i've got *no* idea how i'd do this differently.
[01:03:23] <bumba82> has anyone experienced this problem (I have this problem since beginning of may)
[01:04:50] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[01:07:58] <coldhead> do you have a link bumba82 ?
[01:08:11] <coldhead> someone who knows jQM might be able to help if they can see the problem
[01:08:39] <coldhead> anli_: can you use cookies?
[01:08:44] <coldhead> or html5 local sotage?
[01:08:49] <coldhead> storage* lol
[01:09:29] <bumba82> I use local storage (SQL lite) + local files for images
[01:10:12] <coldhead> bumba82: if you open the page in chrome or firebug or somesuch you should be able to see where it is trying to load the images from
[01:10:49] <bumba82> yes
[01:10:54] <bumba82> Wait I'll explain
[01:10:55] <bumba82> ok
[01:11:01] <coldhead> live demo is better :)
[01:11:06] <coldhead> i'm not very expert in jQM
[01:11:58] <wkmanire> Why does 1 am come so early.
[01:12:04] <bumba82> I know, but the problem is that it is not up to me (my boss doesn't want the app to be shown)
[01:12:04] <wkmanire> :(
[01:12:05] <coldhead> also i am a recreational drug user
[01:12:11] <bumba82> before it is released
[01:12:13] <bumba82> ...
[01:12:25] <bumba82> the fact is that i link to images in the index file
[01:12:28] <coldhead> blergh
[01:12:29] <bumba82> as follows:
[01:12:46] <bumba82> data/img/mypicture.png
[01:13:08] <bumba82> I use the one page template in jqm
[01:13:20] <bumba82> (it is a kind of card layout)
[01:13:39] <bumba82> index.html#firstpage
[01:13:54] <bumba82> activate the div with id = firstpage
[01:14:34] <bumba82> the problem is that when jqm render the page it tries to get the images under firstpage/data/img/mypicture.png
[01:14:44] <bumba82> sorry
[01:14:54] <bumba82> MY_URLfirstpage/data/img/mypicture.png
[01:15:13] <coldhead> and if you add a / before the data?
[01:15:14] <bumba82> between MY_URL and firstpage there isn't the character '/'
[01:15:17] <bumba82> :(
[01:15:53] <bumba82> I think I already tried this ... but let's try again
[01:16:13] <wkmanire> coldhead: What's he building?
[01:16:27] <coldhead> some kind of doomsday device
[01:16:36] <coldhead> NO UM i mean a mobile app
[01:16:39] <wkmanire> Oh, I thought it was something special.
[01:16:43] * wkmanire has like 10 doomsday devices.
[01:16:49] <coldhead> hahah
[01:16:58] <coldhead> please shelter me when the rvolution comes
[01:17:02] <coldhead> i forgot to build any
[01:17:06] <wkmanire> he he he
[01:17:44] <anli_> coldhead: maybe thats the way to do it
[01:17:48] <bumba82> same problem
[01:18:03] <coldhead> it ignores the / ?
[01:18:10] <coldhead> this might be a bug in jQM
[01:18:14] <coldhead> or an unsupported feature
[01:18:32] <anli_> coldhead: what I want is a checkbox that if the user checks it, it will stay checked within the session, even if the user loads another page
[01:18:45] <coldhead> bumba82: you won't like this but i think the best thing you can do is post your problem on forum.jquery.com
[01:18:53] <coldhead> then you can link to that from here to ask for help
[01:19:08] <coldhead> we can get wookiehangover to look at it but it's 3am for him just now
[01:19:25] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have a text, when hovering it, it should turn into a textbox (<input type="text">)...is there already an jquery ui effect for the transition?
[01:19:33] <coldhead> anli_: i can't think how to do that without cookies
[01:19:49] <wkmanire> Other than serverside.
[01:19:53] <anli_> but on the other hand, the server side session needs to keep track on the checkbox then
[01:19:58] <timing> DarsVaeda: If I were you put it in a textbox up front
[01:20:06] <timing> DarsVaeda: then style the textbox like there is none
[01:20:08] <coldhead> the cookie can be ignored by the client
[01:20:14] <O0ddity> Question about JQ selectors
[01:20:24] <timing> DarsVaeda: and then animate to a style which looks like a textbox
[01:20:34] <O0ddity> $('class1 subclass2').function
[01:20:45] <O0ddity> how can i make this work?
[01:20:46] <DarsVaeda> that sounds complicated ^^
[01:20:55] <coldhead> $.cookie['clicked'] = true; if ($.cookie['clicked']) { $(':checkbox').attr('checked', 'checked') }
[01:21:05] <anli_> maybe I could modify the urls of my menu so that information about the checkbox being checked follows with menu item clicks
[01:21:07] <O0ddity> i have an element with class="class subeclass"
[01:21:33] <coldhead> O0ddity: $('.class.subclass')
[01:21:33] <anli_> would not be very hard to do, I think
[01:21:42] <O0ddity> lol
[01:21:43] <coldhead> that selects elements that have both classes
[01:21:44] <O0ddity> cheers
[01:21:48] <O0ddity> yeah
[01:21:52] <O0ddity> thanks
[01:21:55] <coldhead> good luck!
[01:22:29] <coldhead> anli_: it still sounds like more work than just using cookies
[01:22:36] <wkmanire> anli_: You can't rely on cookies for your app?
[01:22:47] <anli_> Well, I am using php sessions
[01:23:00] <coldhead> you can ignore the cookies on the serverside
[01:23:07] <anli_> aha?
[01:23:10] <coldhead> they're persistent storage for the client
[01:23:13] <anli_> so php echoes them automatically?
[01:23:20] <wkmanire> Not raelly
[01:23:22] <coldhead> they'll get sent with every page request but so what
[01:23:23] <wkmanire> really*
[01:23:37] <coldhead> i'll do a quick demo i guess
[01:23:51] <anli_> ah, but if the client sends a cookie and gets back a webpage without the cookie, the cookie will not be cleared on the client side+
[01:23:59] <coldhead> right
[01:24:06] <coldhead> the client doesn't give a shit
[01:24:21] <coldhead> and you can get on with your life
[01:24:22] <coldhead> it just works
[01:24:28] <coldhead> you can even use cookies with static html
[01:24:35] <coldhead> the server won't even notice
[01:27:52] <coldhead> anli_: http://jsfiddle.net/hDTMt/
[01:28:00] <coldhead> note that jsfiddle doesn't give a rat's arse
[01:28:03] <coldhead> <3
[01:28:15] <anli_> :)
[01:31:20] <wkmanire> Damned PHP includes drive me nuts. Why can't I set a default root directory for my site and get to everything with a root /
[01:31:30] <anli_> The cookie plugin was really nice to I can use $.cookie just as  element.data
[01:31:45] <anli_> $.cookie('foo', 'bar'); <-- really nice
[01:31:59] <coldhead> yeah its one of the oldest and best jquery plugins
[01:32:07] <wkmanire> anli_: Sure is, so much so that it comes included with jquery-ui
[01:32:23] <wkmanire> In the externals directory you get in the download archive.
[01:32:25] <anli_> Aha, but I got a script error, maybe I did not include that then
[01:32:37] <anli_> I thought I bloated by build a lot
[01:32:38] <coldhead> wkmanire: maybe you could chroot your PHP process on the server and tell it which dir to use as root ?
[01:32:42] * coldhead guesses
[01:33:13] <coldhead> anli_: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/jquery.cookie.js
[01:33:19] <anli_> I use favicon.ico as a marker for whats the root directory
[01:34:00] <wkmanire> coldhead: Maybe, but my server is also my work machine and I'm using netbeans to build this little toy app. Mostly so I can have a visual debugger.
[01:34:21] <anli_> $file = 'favicon.ico'; then I use file_exists($file), if not, I add ../ to the beginning of $file
[01:34:32] <anli_> And try again
[01:34:59] <anli_> This makes it possible for me to have the main menu of the webpage in a separate include.php
[01:36:48] <anli_> Maybe I should use cookies more
[01:37:34] <wkmanire> anli_: Thats actually a pretty good idea for me. I'm fortunately only 1 directory deep in all cases.
[01:39:39] <wkmanire> anli_: It depends on if you want your site to depend on cookies or not. Its usually completely fine but sessions can still be made to work without any client side dependencies.
[01:40:44] <anli_> I use php sessions anyway
[01:42:46] <wkmanire> I think by default PHP sessions are round-tripping a session id in the cookie, but you can also put the session in the query string for instance to transfer sessions across domains or support cookieless clients. (I'm just blathering)
[01:43:41] <coldhead> the favicon idea is cute except that your site breaks if someone deletes your site icon
[01:43:49] <wkmanire> he he
[01:43:55] <coldhead> which is unexpected to say the least
[01:43:59] <wkmanire> Seems like a bad idea to spin the disk to figure out where your files are.
[01:45:31] <coldhead> phpisaghetto anyway, there i said it
[01:45:34] <wkmanire> Seems like I should be able to tell PHP in my configuration somewhere "Hey, the first '/' starts at /var/www/mysite" and go for there.
[01:45:45] <wkmanire> from*
[01:46:22] <wkmanire> I suppose I could just write a function for it myself and quit my bitching.
[01:46:39] <coldhead> http://php.net/chdir ?
[01:50:33] <wkmanire> coldhead: How'd you get so smart?
[01:51:56] <coldhead> google
[01:52:33] <wkmanire> Your google-foo is stronger than mine.
[01:52:53] <wkmanire> Apparently.
[01:53:30] <coldhead> i have been using php since version 3
[01:53:35] <coldhead> it's not something to be proud of
[01:53:43] <coldhead> in fact it's like that bit near the end of bladerunner
[01:53:45] <coldhead> in the rain
[01:54:11] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[01:54:12] <bot-t> Not much dude, jusâ€™ hanginâ€™ â€™nâ€™ chillinâ€™
[01:54:21] <wkmanire> I'm still new at it. This will probably be my last personal project using it to be honest.
[01:54:42] <wkmanire> PHP is a nice language but the tools are killing me. I'd much rather be working with Python.
[01:54:51] <coldhead> very sensible
[01:59:11] <Wipp> Why doesn't onchange js event see functions that are defined inside $(document).ready()?
[01:59:32] <wkmanire> Wipp: sounds like you're asking the wrong question
[01:59:40] <timing> Wipp: it's in a different scope
[01:59:44] <wkmanire> Wipp: Can you paste your code?
[01:59:56] <timing> wkmanire: his questions is pretty clear :-)
[02:00:08] <coldhead> Wipp: i have nothibg to add, just wanted to say hi
[02:00:12] <timing> Wipp: is your onchange in the document.ready to?
[02:00:14] <Wipp> So how do I access .ready()?
[02:00:24] <wkmanire> timing: good timing.
[02:00:28] <Wipp> no, onchange is simply inside an input tag
[02:00:35] <markj> you bind the events inside document ready instead of using inline javascript
[02:00:39] <Cork> Wipp: define the onchane event inside the ready block
[02:00:40] <coldhead> are you using onchange="" ?
[02:00:41] <markj> so that theyre in the same scope
[02:00:47] <coldhead> ?change @ Wipp
[02:00:47] <bot-t> Wipp, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[02:00:54] <coldhead> don't ever use onchange again
[02:00:57] <coldhead> or i will cry

[02:04:55] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/1930716
[02:04:57] <Zeddy> so whats up? :p
[02:05:05] <coldhead> rapture
[02:05:18] <Zeddy> makes no sense that the myCars[object.deviceID].active is undefined
[02:05:31] <Zeddy> when i print the object itself and inspect it, i clearly see the active parameter set to 2
[02:06:05] <sac> Zeddy, are you really certain it returns that object and not something that has that object inside it or that the object has a property that contains object that has the active property?
[02:06:23] <sac> phew what a sentence
[02:06:58] <Zeddy> :D
[02:07:19] <Zeddy> in the inspect when i click the object, right under it are all the variables
[02:07:24] <Zeddy> but none of them are accessible
[02:08:03] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/1930724
[02:08:09] <Zeddy> thats what it looks like in the console
[02:08:30] <coldhead> works for me, Zeddy http://jsfiddle.net/LK7Tw/
[02:09:22] <Zeddy> wtf
[02:09:25] <Zeddy> yeah makes no sense now
[02:09:41] <coldhead> looks like you're doing complex stuff
[02:10:00] <wkmanire> Zeddy: http://pastie.org/1930729 can you run something like this and then post the console output?
[02:12:13] <Zeddy> uhm
[02:12:14] <Zeddy> for (prop in myCars[object.deviceID]) {
[02:12:19] <Zeddy> it doesn't even enter the loop
[02:12:20] <_ramo> hi
[02:12:40] <_ramo> is it possible to retrieve the height of the content of an iframe dynamically with jquery ?
[02:12:48] <wkmanire> is myCars[object.deviceID] undefined?
[02:12:53] <coldhead> typeof myCars[object.deviceID] ?
[02:13:19] <Cork> _ramo: only if the content of the iframe is the same domain
[02:13:34] <Zeddy> nope typeof returns object
[02:13:59] <_ramo> Cork: yes it is
[02:14:07] <_ramo> same domain and same port
[02:14:18] <Cork> _ramo: then ya, you can
[02:14:25] <_ramo> Cork: how do i implement this?
[02:14:30] <_ramo> i've got currently the follwoing code
[02:14:41] <wkmanire> Zeddy: Jeese, this is weird.
[02:14:42] <Zeddy> solved it
[02:14:44] <_ramo> http://privatepaste.com/ae2f9073b3/akj455k6mn that's resizing the iframe only on first pageload
[02:14:45] <Zeddy> jesus im stupid
[02:14:50] <Zeddy> i reset the object a few lines up
[02:14:53] <_ramo> but not, when the hight in the iframe changes
[02:14:57] <Zeddy> but why did the console output it correctly?
[02:15:06] <Cork> _ramo: bind an even in the page of the iframe for resize
[02:15:17] <wkmanire> Your watch might have got picked up before the object was reassigned.
[02:15:17] <Cork> let it trigger a resize of the iframe
[02:15:17] <coldhead> that's one for the philosophers, Zeddy
[02:15:53] <_ramo> Cork: i don't understand, how do i do that? in the iframe i have an accordeon,
[02:16:08] <_ramo> this accordeon is implemented in another application, which pages are shown in the iframe
[02:16:17] <wkmanire> Or you checked object in a different scope whose closure hadn't had object bashed yet.
[02:16:26] * wkmanire likes guessing games :D
[02:16:45] <Cork> _ramo: something like this $('body', document.iframes[0].contentDocument).bind('resize, function() {});
[02:17:07] <Cork> its not tested so you would have to make sure it find the correct document
[02:18:28] <bumba82> ok solved by myself (as usual), use location.href to build the full url  :S
[02:20:39] <wkmanire> coldhead: Damn, thanks again. chdir ftw.
[02:35:58] <coldhead> thanks for fixing that bumba82
[02:36:00] <coldhead> good work
[02:36:19] <bumba82> well ... I fixed in my app ...
[02:36:28] <coldhead> yes
[02:36:33] <coldhead> good work
[02:36:40] <bumba82> if you need the code I can share it
[02:36:44] <bumba82> :)
[02:36:49] <bumba82> many thanks
[02:37:22] <coldhead> can you pastebin it or put it on a blog or something?

[02:45:27] <wkmanire> ProLoser|Mobile: Does @@ appear more than once?
[02:45:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> wkmanire: yes
[02:45:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> is this not compatible with .replace()?
[02:46:01] <wkmanire> String.replace will only replace the first occurance of @@ closes to index 0.
[02:46:16] <ProLoser|Mobile> hmm
[02:46:18] <wkmanire> by default. You need to use a regex
[02:46:22] <ProLoser|Mobile> how do i replace every single one?
[02:46:33] <wkmanire> /@@/g I think
[02:46:49] <dxgriffiths> wkmanire: yup.
[02:47:50] <wkmanire> ? /(@Y@)

[02:49:04] <ProLoser|Mobile> wkmanire: didn't work?
[02:51:13] <wkmanire> ProLoser|Mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/9eARZ/
[02:51:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> oh i don't encapsulate it, gotcha
[02:51:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> so why can't i do a direct string replace?
[02:51:55] <wkmanire> What do you mean by direct?
[02:52:47] <TC_> Hey.
[02:52:56] <wkmanire> Howdy
[02:52:59] <xec> hey TC_
[02:53:01] <TC_> Hey some more.
[02:53:08] <TC_> Oh.. xec, its you!
[02:53:17] * xec hides
[02:53:21] <TC_> For instance, if I had... containerCss: {height: "100px"},
[02:53:29] <TC_> I would access the css with... s.o.containerCss
[02:53:33] <TC_> how would I access the height?
[02:53:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> wkmanire: not using regex, thanks you got it working though
[02:54:37] <dxgriffiths> General JS help > #jsmentors
[02:54:54] <xec> TC_:  im not sure what containerCss is, but if you want to return height of en element you can simply call .height() on it iirc
[02:55:05] <xec> s/en/an
[02:55:17] <MatthiasVance> dxgriffiths: Or ##javascript?
[02:55:48] <TC_> Yes but that returns "px" but I need the height set... if you remember my main.php code
[02:55:49] <TC_> I have..
[02:55:50] <TC_> containerCss:{backgroundColor:"#fff", border:"5px solid #fff", height:"90%", padding:0, width:"90%"},
[02:55:53] <dxgriffiths> Either / or.
[02:56:07] <TC_> so I need to grab those percentage heights, and reassign them
[02:56:21] <wkmanire> ProLoser|Mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/9eARZ/1/
[02:56:22] <wkmanire> like that
[02:56:27] <wkmanire> The regex is much cleaner
[02:56:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> touche
[02:58:24] <dxgriffiths> I was freaked out by regexes in JS at first, but now I kind of miss them.
[02:58:56] <wkmanire> ProLoser|Mobile: I suppose if you really wanted to you could write a character for character replace algorithm and do a single pass through the string, but only if you like doing that sort of thing. There would be no practical benefit for most use cases.
[02:59:05] <dxgriffiths> regexbuddy.com is a god send.
[02:59:08] <ProLoser|Mobile> no i'm fine lol thanks
[02:59:14] <dxgriffiths> no, regexpal.com.
[03:00:02] <xec> TC_: i dont think you can get the percentage after its been converted to px, because you probably want to retrieve it outside of the scope where you defined it
[03:00:46] <xec> TC_: what you could do is create variables to hold your configuration values
[03:00:55] <wkmanire> dxgriffiths: I hate that JS doesn't have a built in verbose mode for regular expression. So I love to write and use them, or use someone elses. I just hate having to debug/modify one that I wrote 6 months ago.

[03:12:35] <xec> TC_: you got it working? :)
[03:12:50] <wkmanire> Man, the google web fonts resource is awesome. I don't know why I took so long to get around to using it.
[03:12:58] <TC_> i think so
[03:13:43] <TC_> im not sure if it's cross browser compliant but...
[03:13:44] <TC_> Yes I have.
[03:13:44] <TC_> yeah
[03:14:08] <wkmanire> doesn't really matter. You can use it conjunction with whatever you normally would use for font-family
[03:14:36] <wkmanire> Only antiquated browsers like IE9 might be a problem
[03:14:36] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/Pi6ZRAHs thats my code now, xec
[03:14:39] <iamtony> Hey all. Does anyone know about using ICanHaz within a jQuery plugin? It's not finding my template when the plugin is first run, but it does on a button click. Any ideas?
[03:14:41] <wkmanire> Not sure since I don't have it on my machine
[03:15:15] <TC_> minus some css...
[03:15:19] <wkmanire> iamtony: Is it too late to use jQuery.tmpl?
[03:15:41] <xec> TC_: yeah that looks promising
[03:15:47] <wkmanire> There probably isn't any probles with using ICanHaz though.
[03:15:51] <wkmanire> aren't any problems
[03:16:00] * wkmanire is shocked with the horror of that grammar.
[03:16:59] <Kambfhase> TC_: line 5 is awful :S
[03:17:03] <TC_> line 5.
[03:17:12] <TC_> var id = $(this).attr("id");
[03:17:13] <TC_> ?
[03:17:23] <Kambfhase> var id = this.id; // done.
[03:17:33] <TC_> let me try that
[03:18:04] <TC_> yeah :P
[03:18:10] <TC_> i dont' need that var then
[03:18:13] <TC_> chuck it in with the iframe
[03:18:17] <coldhead> Kambfhase: if those are the same operation, why are there 2 different ways to do it then?
[03:18:34] <xec> TC_: your next problem is gonna be the nested iframe, iframe resizing is a pain!
[03:18:45] <TC_> huh?
[03:18:47] <TC_> nested iframe?
[03:19:01] <xec> well, i say nested because its inside your modal
[03:19:05] <iamtony> wkmanire: Want to avoid switching while jQuery.tmpl is still in beta.
[03:19:10] <TC_> it's resizing fine i believe.
[03:19:22] <wkmanire> iamtony: Thats understandeable.
[03:19:23] <no5thdimension> jquery seems to be malbuilt when it comes to <select>
[03:19:33] <Kambfhase> coldhead: a) this.id is a native prop b) its faster than the jquery way
[03:19:40] <no5thdimension> ids and classes don't work
[03:19:41] <iamtony> malbuilt - word of the day :-)
[03:19:45] <Kambfhase> coldhead: do you know the difference between props and attrs?
[03:20:02] <wkmanire> That sounds like a fish species.
[03:20:10] <iamtony> lol
[03:20:29] <no5thdimension> lal. sorry, i have my own special words that I only share with special people
[03:20:30] <xec> TC_: oh right, nevermind me, i was being silly, thought you would need to resize depending on content, but you dont
[03:20:32] <wkmanire> iamtony: Can you make a jsfiddle with your widget and your ICanHaz template?
[03:20:47] <TC_> phew. Don't worry me xec!
[03:20:49] <iamtony> wkmanire: Will do
[03:21:07] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's the best way to populate a droplist with json response?
[03:21:10] * wkmanire firmly believes that anyone who knows what IRC is, is very special indeed.
[03:21:21] <TC_> ProLoser, what mobile do you have?
[03:21:39] <xec> TC_: i just still have a headache from my last project with iframes ;)
[03:22:04] <TC_> I don't like the use of iFrames, but I'm only using them for this damn modal
[03:28:23] <iamtony> wkmanwire: jsfiddle.net/dU5nn
[03:28:41] <iamtony> not sure how I include the icanhaz lib in that
[03:28:49] <wkmanire> I'll do it, just a sec
[03:29:28] <wkmanire> Any reason why you're still using jQuery 1.5.2?
[03:30:10] <wkmanire> iamtony: http://jsfiddle.net/dU5nn/1/ this one haz ICanHaz.
[03:30:10] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Nope :-)
[03:31:47] <wkmanire> iamtony: Just a sec, linting the javascript.
[03:35:58] <wkmanire> iamtony: http://jsfiddle.net/dU5nn/4/ I got rid of several syntax errors.
[03:36:06] <wkmanire> iamtony: Now we can start to troubleshoot.
[03:38:50] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Thanks. Should this run now? I'm not familiar with jsfiddle
[03:39:03] <wkmanire> iamtony: I'm not sure what you're expecting it to do.
[03:39:30] <coldhead> Kambfhase: i think i understand the difference, i just don't understand why jQuery has its own slower way of doing the same thing
[03:39:33] <wkmanire> jsFiddle is just a convenient place for us to collaborate.
[03:41:19] <Kambfhase> coldhead: in order to not support .attr('id') jQuery would get even slower by adding an if. also, you might want to hear the latest jquery podcast episode.
[03:41:29] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Ah sorry, I missed a load of stuff! - http://jsfiddle.net/du5nn/5/
[03:41:57] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Although it seems to be working there  - creating the divs from the template, one for each selected option.
[03:42:05] <coldhead> cool thanks Kambfhase
[03:42:12] <Kambfhase> :)
[03:43:22] <wkmanire> iamtony: Should I be seeing stuff in the HTML output box?
[03:44:10] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Yes, there should be two divs, and a select. The divs were added by icanhaz
[03:44:30] <wkmanire> I don't see anything rendering.
[03:44:59] <wkmanire> but your plugin is only being declared in this fiddle
[03:45:05] <wkmanire> I don't see it being called anywhere
[03:45:36] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Sorry, I didn't realize I had to update jsfiddle - http:/jsfiddle.net/cVtqD
[03:45:58] <wkmanire> Thats better :)
[03:46:42] <wkmanire> Wk the manwire
[03:46:59] <wkmanire> iamtony: So anyway, if it is working in fiddle it can and should be working in your site.
[03:47:15] <wkmanire> Just need to dig around see where the problem is.
[03:47:57] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Yeah, the only difference is that I'm running the plugin in a document.ready on an external js file - It must be down to the order it runs them in.
[03:48:23] <wkmanire> Yeah, the plugin needs to be loaded before it is used (stating the obvious)
[03:48:51] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Yep, I think the problem is that it's being loaded before ICH is grabbing it's template list.
[03:49:14] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Actually forcing ICH to refresh before I grab the template works - Weird
[03:49:36] <wkmanire> I've only ever read about ICanHaz to be honest.
[03:49:49] <wkmanire> How does it grab the templates?
[03:50:38] <wkmanire> I see, it looks for any script element with type="text/html"
[03:50:54] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Yeah, looks like it just searches the dom for script tags - It seems to do it on document.ready too, so must be running after my code. Seems a bit flimsy :-) Thanks loads for your help though - sorry it was pretty much a non-issue.
[03:50:56] <eldho> irc://freenode/prosody
[03:51:12] <eldho> oops.i am sorry
[03:51:57] <wkmanire> Race issues like that can be tough to deal with.
[03:53:03] <dtach> hi there, im trying to create an effect like most video players have where if you move your mouse the controls appear, when using mouse over/out this does not work the same unless you take your cursor far away from it, i need it to show a div when you are actually moving your mouse (not just have it on the div in question) any ideas?
[03:53:18] <coldhead> this podcast is boring
[03:53:24] <coldhead> so much talk about version numvers
[03:53:31] <coldhead> numbers*
[03:53:45] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Yep. I kind of expected ICH to force itself to the front - you pretty much always need it run first. Guess that's not possible tho.
[03:53:57] <wkmanire> iamtony: you can do something like $(function () { if  (typeof ich.templateName === 'undefined') { setTimeout(arguments.callee, 100); return; } /* do my page load */ });
[03:54:35] <wkmanire> obviously how you detect if the template is available yet may need tweeking, but the pattern stands.
[03:55:08] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Cool, that's a good idea. Cheers!
[03:55:28] <wkmanire> 100ms is a long time as far as page loads go. So that should be shortened as much as possible.
[03:57:24] <wkmanire> iamtony: I found a better option
[03:58:07] <wkmanire> iamtony: The last 3 lines inside of the ICanHaz script look like // init itself on document ready $(function () {ich.grabTemplates();});
[03:58:31] <wkmanire> iamtony: Delete them. Then on your page load just call ich.grabTemplates() before you try to use ich templates anywhere.
[03:58:53] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Ha perfect!
[03:59:17] <wkmanire> iamtony: After you delete them you can use http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs to minify the script.
[03:59:44] <wkmanire> alright, it just turned 4am. Time to sleep. Good night folks.
[03:59:59] <iamtony> wkmanwire: Good night - Thanks againa for your help

[04:13:36] <madjoe> ... but it jumps at the end in IE8.
[04:32:11] <deuterium> does .append create a copy or replace sth?
[04:34:51] <Kambfhase> deuterium: it moves the current element. no copying
[04:38:39] <deuterium> Kambfhase: thanks. somehow http://dpaste.com/544646/ doesn't seem to work.
[04:39:17] <Kambfhase> what does not work?
[04:39:35] <LSshock> can anyone help me out with a damn IE8 error? its failing to use my Array, http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/ is the code bits
[04:40:09] <deuterium> Kambfhase: that div doesn't get appended
[04:40:24] <deuterium> if i inspect the dom tree after executing this
[04:40:38] <Kambfhase> deuterium: is your page online?
[04:40:52] <deuterium> Kambfhase: unfortunately not
[04:41:17] <Kambfhase> deuterium: pas everything, html, js and css to http://jsfiddle.net/ then, please.
[04:41:20] <deuterium> Kambfhase: if i understand you correctly, this should work, from a code point of view?
[04:41:27] <Kambfhase> yes
[04:41:31] <deuterium> ok
[04:43:10] <ravenzz> deuterium you shouldn't use "title" "div" as variable name
[04:43:20] <dr0id> anyone used tinymce ?
[04:43:34] <dr0id> it forces p tags, I used force_p_newlines : false, , but no luck

[04:45:55] <dr0id> I don't want to force br for newlines btw
[04:46:00] <ravenzz> ok
[04:46:01] <ravenzz> :P
[04:46:09] <deuterium> unfortunately, i don't really know how to use jsfiddle, but it looks like a very powerful tool
[04:46:09] <JeanM> How could I write this in a shorter way? $("div[contenteditable=true], span[contenteditable=true], p[contenteditable=true]")
[04:46:39] <JeanM> i.e. something like $("div, span, p, &:has[contenteditable=true]") or something?
[04:46:50] <ravenzz> mh
[04:46:53] <Kambfhase> ?filter @ JeanM
[04:46:54] <bot-t> JeanM, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:47:29] <quicksilver> JeanM: you could just use $("[contenteditable=true]")
[04:47:39] <quicksilver> admittedly that will pick up other elements but maybe that doesn't matter?
[04:47:42] <JeanM> quicksilver: but I only want it for div, span and p
[04:47:47] <quicksilver> otherwise, what Kambfhase said.
[04:47:57] <ravenzz> $('div, p, span').has("[contenteditable=true]")
[04:47:58] <ravenzz> ?
[04:48:03] <quicksilver> JeanM: you could just use $("[contenteditable=true]").filter("div, span, p")
[04:48:23] <quicksilver> ravenzz: not has, no, that looks for children.
[04:48:23] <Kambfhase> ravenzz: has is wrong here, filter is the way to go
[04:48:30] <ravenzz> oh i see
[04:48:35] <ravenzz> i don't try it
[04:48:46] <JeanM> quicksilver: Thanks that seems to do the trick, I guess sorting by contenteditable and then by div/span/p is faster than first getting all the div/span/p tags?
[04:49:02] <Kambfhase> i doubt it matters
[04:49:02] <quicksilver> JeanM: not sure. If I had to guess, I'd guess the other way around would be faster.
[04:49:21] <quicksilver> if you really want to know, test it on your page :)
[04:49:24] <JeanM> okay, thanks, I was indeed using has before, that's why it failed
[04:49:28] <quicksilver> unless you have a huge huge page it won't matter.
[04:49:55] <deuterium> ravenzz: if i click on "run" on http://jsfiddle.net/CSTkt/1/, nothing happens to the code in the "html" field. means: code=bad?
[04:50:28] <ravenzz> on open it automatically runs
[04:50:33] <ravenzz> you should inspect
[04:50:51] <ravenzz> the code in the Result frame
[04:51:41] <ravenzz> or add some debugging text o console.debug($('#map'));
[04:52:13] <deuterium> ravenzz: ok, i try it again using ff. with iron (a chromium variant), it doesn't seem to work.
[04:53:04] <deuterium> ravenzz: no output in the results frame either. does that snippet really work for you?

[04:55:45] <rubydiamond_> What is the best jquery plugin for doing i18
[04:56:07] <shomon> meanwhile I'll ask: I have thickbox windows all over the place and a project to hand in today...
[04:56:19] <shomon> and basically on a small screen it doesn't show up
[04:56:25] <shomon> you can't scroll to the top and save
[04:56:31] <deuterium> hm there's just a warning in the console, no error
[04:58:12] <rubydiamond_> What is the best jquery plugin for doing i18
[04:58:52] <shomon> is there a thickbox hack that maybe checks window size and makes the thickbox resize to it, or just gives you scroll bars?
[04:59:02] <shomon> the background page scrolls, but not what's in the thickbox frame
[04:59:31] <shomon> meanwhile I'll look up how easy it would be to switch the problematic thickboxes with a jquery ui dialog

[05:18:09] <coldhead> ask easier questions
[05:18:13] <coldhead> talk about simpler things
[05:18:23] <deuterium> Kambfhase: so, it's the $(div) vs. div? or that you put the various css statements into one .css?
[05:18:33] <Kambfhase> both
[05:18:43] <deuterium> oh
[05:19:01] <deuterium> what was wrong with the multiple .css?

[05:37:47] <LSshock> CoolCoder: forgot to select jquery on the site http://jsfiddle.net/TuQbc/1/
[05:38:39] <EdwardIII> hey
[05:38:43] <CoolCoder> no that code is just a part
[05:39:01] <CoolCoder> LSshock: added jquery. it was just a function
[05:39:22] <EdwardIII> so i've created a nice little vertical tab set with jquery-ui-tabs, but now i want to modify it a bit. after jquery turns the links into hover events... i want to make it so that when a user clicks it takes them to another url
[05:39:39] <LSshock> CoolCoder: hm there doesnt seem to be a error at least not seeing it
[05:39:46] <EdwardIII> how can i build on top of what jquery's already done? can i just access elements it's creating dynamically in <script> on my page?
[05:40:06] <LSshock> CoolCoder: not sure if this would freak out on jsfiddle if the pages cant be loaded though
[05:40:16] <LSshock> CoolCoder: are you using something like firebug or the dev tools in chrome?
[05:40:21] <CoolCoder> yes
[05:40:25] <CoolCoder> firebug
[05:40:28] <CoolCoder> its not error
[05:40:30] <LSshock> hm
[05:40:39] <CoolCoder> i need to get correct code for this side
[05:41:06] <CoolCoder> there is no error in this. but i am not able to find the correct code to show the content as slide from right to left with html()
[05:42:05] <dxgriffiths> CoolCoder: html() returns a string, not a jQuery object.
[05:42:18] <dxgriffiths> Oh wait, I'm an idiot. Ignore.
[05:42:20] <CoolCoder> LSshock: best example is http://www.helloweb.co.uk/ezine/index.html check this link. here on click of button u can see the content loading with animation. i need to get the that working.
[05:42:49] <Chib> strike: tradingtime[1] needs to be double quoted
[05:43:01] <strike> Chib thanks!
[05:43:53] <CoolCoder> $("#inner_area").html(data).animate("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1500); like this any other command for loading html in an animated way
[05:44:22] <LSshock> CoolCoder: your example isnt working, its missing two js files and clicking doesnt do anything here
[05:44:50] <CoolCoder> check my last line please
[05:45:46] <LSshock> looks fine to me but im no expert, how about checking data in your log, add above that console.log(data);
[05:45:59] <LSshock> see if it even loads properly
[05:46:38] <CoolCoder> LSshock: Its ok. Its not issue with loading the content. but i need a solution to animate this content on load.  leave it.
[05:46:51] <LSshock> oh right
[05:47:03] <LSshock> then dont use slide
[05:47:08] <CoolCoder> then

[05:48:45] <SpecialEmily> jsfiddle ftw
[05:48:52] <sean`> emily ftw
[05:48:55] <LSshock> CoolCoder: i dont think animate has slide, its a thing on its own
[05:48:58] <LSshock> i could be wrong but try
[05:49:11] <LSshock> $("#inner_area").html(data).show('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000);

[05:55:57] <JeanM> in js, is it somehow possible to do a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 ? This seems not to work, but is there some other way to mass-assign variables?
[05:56:04] <Whirl3d> Has anyone had a problem with jquery reporting incorrect values for window width/height?
[05:56:25] <Whirl3d> JeanM, a for loop? or .map
[05:56:35] <kojiro> JeanM: think about the fact that variables in javascript are always properties of some object or another...
[05:58:45] <EdwardIII> i mean let's say we changed this example from event: click to event: mouseover, how can we hijack 'click' again to do something totally different? http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/tabs/vertical.html
[05:58:49] <djQuery> JeanM: is var a=1,b=2,c=3; realy that much different than what u had?

It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[05:59:37] <Whirl3d> EdwardIII, you can have multiple binds to the click event I think
[06:00:05] <EdwardIII> Whirl3d: how can i inject my event? all the loopy stuff is happening behind the scenes in jquery
[06:00:28] <Whirl3d> EdwardIII, what are you trying to inject?
[06:00:41] <EdwardIII> Whirl3d: redirect to a url
[06:01:00] <EdwardIII> so if they hover over the tab, it changes the content, but if they click it it whisks them off somewhere else
[06:01:17] <Whirl3d> $("element").click(function (e) { e.preventDefault()....redirect
[06:01:56] <EdwardIII> ho hum, let me think
[06:02:03] <dxgriffiths> CoolCoder: are you still there?
[06:02:08] <LSshock> anyone know how i can make this array work in IE(8)? trailersQ[playIndex].url (trailersQ contains title+url) works fine in ANY other browser :(
[06:02:18] <Whirl3d> EdwardIII, preventDefault stops the Click Event from continuing on to the element
[06:02:40] <EdwardIII> if you imagine there's a <a class="redirector" href="http://yahoo.com">Somewhere</a> in the content area, that's where i need to get the src for the redirect from
[06:02:48] <EdwardIII> in each content area, for each tab
[06:02:54] <dxgriffiths> LSshock: CoolCode's problem was that show/hide("slide" requires jQuery UI.
[06:03:17] <EdwardIII> Whirl3d: i don't want 'em to all goto the same place
[06:03:47] <LSshock> dxgriffiths: ah of course
[06:03:48] <Whirl3d> $(".redirector").click(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); var href=$(this).attr("href"); window.location=href;})
[06:03:50] <djQuery> EdwardIII: somethign like this $( "#tabs" ).tabs({event: "mouseover"}).find('li>a').click(fucntion(e){e.preventDefault(); widnow.location = this.href; });
[06:06:17] <djQuery> EdwardIII: that is actualy a little harder. you dont want to get the href from the <li><a href="#divid">Whatever</a></li> that typicaly makes up the tab but from the div divid?
[06:06:33] <djQuery> morning ravenzz
[06:06:58] <EdwardIII> hrm djQuery it's actually in the place where the content is coming from ... i'm just thinking
[06:07:12] <EdwardIII> djQuery: like you say i can't use href as that already has #link-to-id in it
[06:07:30] <EdwardIII> i could just put another <a href="my-desired-location.html"> after it - would that be easier to locate in jquery?
[06:07:48] <djQuery> EdwardIII: you do know that tabs can load that content dynmamicaly into the tab dont you?
[06:08:24] <EdwardIII> so i'd have <a class="tab-1" href="#content-1">Tab 1</a><a href="associated-real-link.htm">More info</a>
[06:08:47] <EdwardIII> djQuery: using ajax you mean? i actually want to send the user off to another page - it's not really tab nav, you see - you hover over a tab and it shows you this sexy picture and a little bit of text
[06:08:57] <EdwardIII> but when they click the link after they've hovered on it i want to send them off to the real content on another page
[06:09:15] <kbni> 3
[06:09:53] <EdwardIII> 4?
[06:10:26] <djQuery> fucntion(e){e.preventDefault(); var divid = this.href, href = $('#' + divid).find('a:first')' if (href){window.location = href.attr('href);} }
[06:10:52] <EdwardIII> i tried adding this for testing, but clicking doesn't seem to take me anywhere and i get no errors in the j.s. console: http://www.pastie.org/1931577
[06:10:58] <LSshock> trailersQ[playIndex].url the problem it has is with .url  my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/
[06:11:28] <ravenzz> hello djQuery !
[06:12:47] <djQuery> EdwardIII: you should be able to slap those 2 together and get it to work
[06:13:26] <EdwardIII> djQuery: any thoughts why clicking on these links isn't sending me to redirection heaven? http://www.pastie.org/1931577
[06:13:46] <djQuery> EdwardIII: honestly I would just make it to where it opens on hover and shows the thumbnail then fire the redirect on click of the thumbnail instead of click of the tab
[06:13:56] <EdwardIII> heh
[06:14:06] <EdwardIII> i can do that easily enough - there's an href on the thumbnail that i can change
[06:14:08] <EdwardIII> (it's wordpress)
[06:14:23] <EdwardIII> but i just thought that might be confusing to users
[06:14:37] <EdwardIII> although having said that if i change the mouse cursor to arrow rather than hand that might clear things up for them
[06:14:52] <djQuery> I would think that having the redirect happen on the tab click would be more confusing

[06:18:10] <ravenzz> hasClass
[06:18:12] <ravenzz> :?
[06:18:18] <DarsVaeda1> not really
[06:18:40] <ravenzz> so what?
[06:18:41] <DarsVaeda1> that checks if a specific element has a class, I just want to know if there is a class in general
[06:18:49] <ravenzz> uhm
[06:18:53] <ravenzz> then select it
[06:19:02] <ravenzz> and check his lenght
[06:19:14] <DarsVaeda1> if thats null then it doesnt exist?
[06:19:24] <jeffsmykil> how do i do if this value == a regex
[06:19:27] <ravenzz> if ($('.foo').length) { /* do someghitn */ }
[06:19:43] <ravenzz> it returns 0 (also false)
[06:19:44] <markj> he did just say not a specific one
[06:19:58] <ravenzz> not a specific Element

[06:20:07] <csaunders> I have a jquery mobile application that when it transitions between pages, appears to sort of flicker
[06:20:07] <ner0x> How can I test my jquery/javascript without using selenium (Main browser is chromium/chrome)
[06:20:14] <DarsVaeda1> a specific class but not a specific element :)
[06:20:45] <csaunders> The content of these pages are (usually just once) dynamically generated
[06:21:29] <csaunders> ner0x: There's some tools out there like zombie, phantom and jasmine I believe
[06:21:49] <csaunders> ner0x: I personally haven't gotten to working with any of them yet, but they should provide a headless way of testing your application
[06:22:24] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: if val.match(/ /) isn't null
[06:22:45] <jeffsmykil> that work in 1.4.1?
[06:22:58] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: That's JS.
[06:23:14] <jeffsmykil> kk
[06:23:48] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: else if ($(this).val().match(([a-fA-F0-9]{8})) != 'null')
[06:24:24] <jeffsmykil> actually\
[06:24:26] <jeffsmykil>                             else if ($(this).val().match('([a-fA-F0-9]{8})') != 'null') //if the first two charachters are 00
[06:24:35] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: just null. And it's match(/stuff/)
[06:24:54] <dxgriffiths> If it doesn't start and end with / / it's not a regex.
[06:25:36] <Whirl3d> if I want a menu to disappear after a short delay once moused off, but to cancel the delay if remoused over 8) , what's the best way to handle that?
[06:26:10] <jeffsmykil> thank you
[06:26:54] <sero|work> Whirl3d, try whateverevent().stop().animate()
[06:27:01] <sero|work> for your remouse
[06:27:01] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: No prob.
[06:27:44] <Whirl3d> sero|work, but how do I set the delay? I thought I would use setTimeout, but then how do I clear it?
[06:28:20] <smik> I've seen website download all the icons, images as one big file and then slice it up and place it. I believe this reduces the time to download all the file individually (time wasted in HTTP handshake). How is it done?
[06:28:29] <sero|work> That's a good question my friend, I've got no trick for that one ;(
[06:29:03] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  something like  timer=0;    $( 'menu'  ).hover(function(){   clearTimeout(timer); $(this).fadeIn()  }, function(){    timer=setTimeout(function(){  $(this).fadeOut() },1000)  }))
[06:29:19] <jeffsmykil> ah i needed a ^ and a $
[06:30:10] <Whirl3d> Aamir, so by setting timer=0 outside the hover function, I can still access it inside. Don't know why I didn't think of that. Thanks.
[06:30:25] <Aamir> Whirl3d: wait
[06:30:45] <Whirl3d> Aamir, waiting....
[06:31:20] <CoolCoder> Please check this http://jsfiddle.net/F8tNK/  I need $("#inner_area").html(data); this line to load data to the div in an animated way right to left? Is it possible?
[06:31:25] <ner0x> csaunders: Zombie looks appealing.
[06:32:23] <smik> Got it, I think it is called CSS sprites
[06:32:33] <dxgriffiths> CoolCoder: The problem with your code before was that it needed to be show, not animate... and it needed jQuery UI.
[06:35:00] <CoolCoder> dxgriffiths: not clear.
[06:35:17] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  http://jsfiddle.net/98VFV/
[06:35:36] <LSshock> CoolCoder: the line i gave you is the way to use slide and it requires jQ UI
[06:35:37] <dxgriffiths> CoolCoder: you were using animate(), and it needed to be show()... and the show("slide" method relies on having jQuery UI present.
[06:36:27] <sero|work> Aamir, very nice
[06:36:28] <CoolCoder> k will check
[06:37:35] <Aamir> sero|work, Whirl3d  you can add mousemove & mouseleave events to h1 itself to clear the timer and keep the menu visible if user hover the menu itself
[06:38:14] <CoolCoder> dxgriffiths: Its loading from an AJAX call. thats 'data', will it be able to show this data to a div container with show()?
[06:38:26] <LSshock> CoolCoder: you can do it without jquery UI and with animate but just not slide instead animate the position
[06:40:45] <CoolCoder> LSshock: But not working dear. I am trying this for long. i found the same way in cycle plugin. but it is not working with ajax calls.
[06:41:00] <CoolCoder> fro a single element
[06:41:59] <CoolCoder> dxgriffiths: hey.. thanks man. for it with UI plugin.
[06:42:06] <CoolCoder> i will fix it now
[06:42:08] <CoolCoder> thankssssssssss
[06:42:09] <LSshock> CoolCoder: the animate doc has an example that animates it from the left, all you'd need to have is set the div to have a negative left value or margin-left minus value and animate that into the plus
[06:42:19] <Whirl3d> Aamir, sorry for the delay. THanks for your help. Here's what I was trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6hxys/6/
[06:42:35] <LSshock> CoolCoder: to load jquery UI just for the slide is kinda ridiculous
[06:42:42] <buggraph> LSshock: could you please locate the source for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph    ?
[06:43:27] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: how come /^([=W0369])/ wouldnt match anything starting with =W0369?
[06:43:50] <jeffsmykil> it just matches the =
[06:44:00] <AlexC_> morning
[06:44:21] <LSshock> buggraph: 5seconds work mate, but here http://code.google.com/p/flot/
[06:44:35] <AlexC_> if I have an element positioned absolutely ... how can I get the position/offset that it's really at?
[06:44:53] <Whirl3d> Aamir, I can't get the menu to drop, only fade out. Any ideas why? It's likely just a CSS issue, but it escapes me.
[06:44:58] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  busy, wait
[06:45:05] <dtach> AlexC_: theres both a position() and offset() function in jq
[06:45:22] <Whirl3d> Aamir, take your time. No rush. Thanks for the help
[06:45:23] <AlexC_> dtach: yes, both will return 0 for the left value for elements positioned absolutely
[06:45:26] <dtach> AlexC_: http://api.jquery.com/offset/ http://api.jquery.com/position/
[06:45:35] <dtach> AlexC_: oh
[06:45:43] <CoolCoder> LSshock: will check this later. now got the things what i needed. will research the solution later
[06:45:50] <CoolCoder> thanks for your elp
[06:45:52] <CoolCoder> help
[06:46:33] <AlexC_> dtach: indeed, so I'm a little stuck =\ I just need to see if this element is "sticking out" from another DIV, if so I need to move it to the left by how ever much it's hanging out
[06:46:39] <buggraph> dtach: cheers mate
[06:47:21] <dtach> AlexC_: hm afraid i cant help you
[06:47:33] <AlexC_> ok, thanks anyway
[06:47:46] <Whirl3d> What are the CSS requirements to make it possible to animate the position of a div? is it position:relative inside of a postion:absolute? or what about absolute inside absolute?
[06:47:49] <MatthiasVance> You know, yesterday I was trying to find out a way to capture the "ready" / "onload" of an iframe document.
[06:48:13] <MatthiasVance> It took me an hour (I tried .load() first, then figured that was for the ajax load only), but I really love jQuery for the simplicity!
[06:48:38] <MatthiasVance> $("#bla").load(function() { /* do stuff here */});
[06:51:14] <dtach> buggraph: yeah looks great, its okay i was actually looking for something like this too haha
[06:54:21] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  remove overflow:hidden and float:left
[06:56:38] <EdwardIII> hrm where did ravenzz go? he says he had the secret to everlast life and hover/clickable tabs
[06:57:21] <Whirl3d> Aamir, that doesn't work at all actually. I must be misunderstanding you.
[06:58:03] <Whirl3d> Aamir, here it is without float left/hidden....http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6hxys/11/
[06:58:10] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  dont update fiddle on each of ur change. just click RUN once, its working than click update :|
[06:58:13] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/6hxys/12/
[07:00:02] <Whirl3d> Aamir, will do. I am trying to make the horizontal menu appear inside the header and after a short delay to appear to drop down like the header was a window and the contents dropped out of sight
[07:00:46] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  i recon do it with css
[07:01:01] <Aamir> ?g css dropdown menu @Whirl3d

[07:01:10] <Whirl3d> thx
[07:01:36] <astropirate> anyone know what documentation generator jQuery uses?
[07:02:08] <Whirl3d> Aamir, not exactly what I was looking for, but I appreciate your time none the less. I'll figure it out
[07:02:49] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  try it, make a clean fiddle example n will b happy to help.
[07:03:47] <EdwardIII> although i'm probably not going to go down this route now i would appreciate any input as to why this doesn't seem to send me to clicking heaven: http://www.pastie.org/1931577
[07:03:55] <Whirl3d> Aamir, this looks almost perfect, the only thing is that the menu doesn't animate it's position--only it's opacity. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6hxys/13/
[07:03:58] <EdwardIII> i don't seem to get any errors when i click
[07:04:23] <Aamir> damnn fiddle is painfully slow :x
[07:04:44] <Whirl3d> Aamir, gimme a sec and I'll give you a better url
[07:05:52] <dtach> can anyone help me out with a damn IE8 error? its failing to use my Array, http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/ is the code bits problem is the .url part
[07:06:50] <r3v3rb> hi all
[07:07:53] <r3v3rb> can someone have a quick look at this http://m-spacehosting.com/~e14s3m11/
[07:08:31] <r3v3rb> and explain why the mouseenter doesn't always catch the first time you rollover the menu ?
[07:11:56] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/6hxys/14/
[07:12:08] <Whirl3d> Aamir, try: http://www.ldwolfe.net/test/menuTest.html
[07:22:02] <letsgojuno_> anyone got a min to help, I'm just trying to send two values lat and lng to the server using ajax.. http://jsfiddle.net/letsgojuno/3WJpt/
[07:23:10] <na3r> is there any problem to use multiselector like this
[07:23:18] <na3r> $(".posts_item > h2 > a, .nav a").click(function(e){
[07:23:21] <dxgriffiths> letsgojuno_: what's the issue?
[07:23:35] <dxgriffiths> na3r: shouldn't be.
[07:24:45] <na3r> dxgriffiths, u mean it doesn't make prob
[07:24:52] <letsgojuno_> dxgriffiths : im not really sure tbh, its resulting in error each time, im not sure if im creating the json correctly
[07:25:12] <dxgriffiths> na3r: right, it is ok to have a list of selectors.
[07:25:22] <dxgriffiths> letsgojuno_: what's the error?
[07:26:06] <letsgojuno_> i just have the console.log in req.error()
[07:26:15] <letsgojuno_> so not really sure where the errors coming
[07:27:09] <dxgriffiths> Oh, right. Well, maybe try grabbing the HTML error code. And check to see if search.php is logging any errors.
[07:27:38] <letsgojuno_> im creating both files.  im just not 100% on how the communication work
[07:28:05] <letsgojuno_> the js and the php
[07:28:07] <dxgriffiths> letsgojuno_: Your JSON looks fine to me, so long as those two values exist.
[07:28:44] <Whirl3d> Aamir, I can't figure this out. Here is what should happen, same file, mostly the same script and yet it works in the block in the middle, just not at the top?
[07:29:11] <letsgojuno_> yea they do, in the php to test im just echoing $_POST
[07:29:15] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  tried it but not working for me either, try asking someone else :(
[07:29:20] <dxgriffiths> The error function will be able to receive an error code argument, that'll help diagnose what's actually happening.
[07:29:22] <letsgojuno_> could that be causing problem?
[07:31:03] <letsgojuno_> got it wasn't json_encoding in php
[07:31:26] <dxgriffiths> letsgojuno_: Ok cool. So what effect was that having?
[07:32:01] <letsgojuno_> im assuming because the return value wasnt in json format the ajax call was resulting in error.
[07:32:19] <EdwardIII> ah, figured it - i had a bad selector
[07:32:38] <Whirl3d> Aamir, so I just tried it without opacity and it works perfectly. Why would adding opacity to the animation break the position?
[07:32:46] <dxgriffiths> letsgojuno_: makes sense.
[07:34:22] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  no idea mate, this should work but dont know why its failing http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/6hxys/15/
[07:34:29] <jeffsmykil> is matching regex done with != null or !=true
[07:35:32] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: !== null
[07:35:43] <jeffsmykil> that seems like to many =
[07:36:25] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: !== is called strict inequality, it won't try to perform any datatype conversion.
[07:36:33] <jeffsmykil> huh
[07:36:35] <jeffsmykil> interesting
[07:36:39] <jeffsmykil> never heard of that
[07:36:50] <jeffsmykil> that was the problem
[07:36:51] <Whirl3d> Aamir, guess we found a bug. Works perfectly with 1.5.1, but breaks in 1.6
[07:37:03] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: ===/!== are usually recommended because they give more consistent results.
[07:37:22] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  make test cases and report it if u r sure )
[07:37:24] <Aamir> :)
[07:37:28] <jeffsmykil> ty
[07:37:48] <zivester_> $.each("somevar",function(i,v){});  is that the same as $.each(["somevar"],function(i,v){});
[07:38:40] <Aamir> zivester:  what is somevar? array? jquery object ?
[07:39:05] <Aamir> zivester_:  ^
[07:39:08] <zivester_> a string literal
[07:39:47] <zivester_> s/somevar/somestring/
[07:40:19] <gnarf> ?js $.each("string", function ( i, k) { console.log(i+": "+k+";"); });
[07:40:20] <bot-t> gnarf: "0: s;""1: t;""2: r;""3: i;""4: n;""5: g;""string"
[07:40:28] <Kambfhase> i doubt that $.each is supposed to be passed into $.each
[07:40:30] <Aamir> zivester_:  somevar can be > array, object here
[07:40:45] <Kambfhase> *a string
[07:41:22] <gnarf> seems it does character by character because strings are "array like" (have length) - but thats undocumented and not its purpose
[07:41:34] <gnarf> if you really wanted that "string".split("") is better to $.each
[07:41:34] <zivester_> ha my test case was a single letter... well that was dumb... ok it strings the string as an array of chars
[07:41:39] <dtach> what could cause my global var to not work in all my functions? it's only working for one of my buttons
[07:41:53] <zivester_> sees the string*
[07:42:16] <dtach> uhh, so clicking the button fills the variable (array) but in my other functions i can't use that array no more
[07:42:53] <dtach> var trailersQ = [] and in the button click it fills it var trailersQ = $('.movie').map(function () {}
[07:44:04] <guy> when I use jquery.hide()
[07:44:25] <guy> I want it to hide on horizontally. how to do that?
[07:44:39] <dtach> guy: hide doesnt animate or anything it just sets it to display:none;
[07:44:54] <guy> dtach: you are wrong, read the spec.
[07:45:31] <guy> anyway. I found the answer. ("blind", { direction: "horizontal" }, 1000)
[07:46:11] <dtach> :P
[07:46:43] <seutje> bah, why does lightbox fiddle with my shit after the onComplete fired? >: |
[07:46:47] <seutje> colorbox*
[07:49:20] <EdwardIII> hrm the alert shows [Object object]... how can i find out a bit more? toString shows that too
[07:49:23] <EdwardIII> http://www.pastie.org/1931986
[07:49:36] <gnarf> EdwardIII: what browser?
[07:49:41] <EdwardIII> gnarf: chromium
[07:49:47] <gnarf> console.log
[07:49:50] <gnarf> console.dir
[07:49:51] <gnarf> etc
[07:50:15] <EdwardIII> gnarf: hrm, do those *in* the js console on chrome you mean?
[07:50:23] <EdwardIII> i basically want to dump the object, or at least see it's methods
[07:50:36] <EdwardIII> because href.href returns undefined, so does href.id for that matter
[07:50:37] <gnarf> EdwardIII: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide15 --- thats what console.log does dude
[07:51:05] <EdwardIII> oh i see, it's jquery
[07:51:07] <EdwardIII> thanks
[07:51:15] <gnarf> no
[07:51:17] <gnarf> it isn't
[07:51:19] <gnarf> its debugger
[07:51:25] <gnarf> built into chrome
[07:51:28] <gnarf> firebug in firefox
[07:51:32] <gnarf> dev tools in ie
[07:51:54] <gnarf> you might want to just read that whole presentation
[07:52:30] <EdwardIII> cheers
[07:52:37] <EdwardIII> console.dir is great
[07:56:24] <ch3mical> Morning
[08:02:27] <Fox`> does the click event not work on elements loaded with ajax?
[08:02:57] <dxgriffiths> Fox` you might need to use live, or make sure you're setting the click event after the element is created.
[08:02:59] <gooddesignusa> Fox`:  that is correct
[08:03:06] <Fox`> ok
[08:03:12] <MatthiasVance> gooddesignusa: That's not correct.
[08:03:14] <MatthiasVance> Sure it works.
[08:03:19] <MatthiasVance> You just need to be sure it's actually added.
[08:03:27] <gooddesignusa> yeah like dxgriffiths said. if you add it after
[08:03:42] <littulb> whats the website where you can let others look at your script????
[08:03:49] <gooddesignusa> i just assumed he was talking about adding the click event first and than loading something with ajax
[08:03:50] <MatthiasVance> You mean jsfiddle?
[08:04:11] <MatthiasVance> gooddesignusa: I didn't mean to nitpick, I think we were all right. :D
[08:04:51] <guy> how to get element opacity?
[08:06:02] <eml> Element opacity is a CSS attribute no? so .css('name') would be my guess
[08:06:28] <gooddesignusa> .css('opacity')
[08:08:29] <littulb> http://jsfiddle.net/TYfzs/   <--- can someone tell me the best way to clone that to another div and display only its value??
[08:13:13] <Whirl3d> Good morning ch3mical.
[08:14:45] <Trisox> any one an idea how to do this ?  i got data-aanhef="dhr" which needs to be used as radio-button value. I want to make the radio-button with that value checked
[08:15:21] <Whirl3d> Aamir, I tried to make a test case for the bug we found earlier, but it ended up being a complete mess. Not really sure why, but it's as though toggle(), hover(), and animate() are not working together...I dunno what is going on. lol
[08:15:47] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  :)
[08:15:49] <Whirl3d> Aamir, http://www.ldwolfe.net/test/menuTest.html
[08:16:12] <Aamir> littulb:  clone what? which div? value of what?
[08:19:08] <Trisox> got it
[08:19:08] <Trisox> var val = 'mw'; $("input:[value="+val+"]").attr('checked',true);
[08:22:21] <jklmnop> does anyone know if there is a finished version of the official jq tooltip plugin tutorial? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:28:37] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: How's it going?
[08:29:20] <joikus> you guys,
[08:29:27] <joikus> is there away to re-render an img src?
[08:29:41] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: with opacity on, it still drops out for me (Chrome)
[08:29:45] <joikus> example, I do obj.attr('src', imgSrc);
[08:29:58] <joikus> but then later, I upload an image on the server, the imgSrc is the same
[08:30:19] <guy> do I need to serialize data if I want to send all form variables?
[08:30:28] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: when I do the random number of clicks it starts acting funny though
[08:32:43] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: in your hover event, try adding () after those function calls
[08:33:02] <ch3mical> showFadeMenu(), hideFadeMenu()
[08:33:07] <Phoenixz> When I want to have all elements of a form, I should be able to use $('#formid').serialize(), right? If I get nothing (empty string), went wrong?
[08:33:30] <ch3mical> Functions get executed differently with and without the ()
[08:34:28] <ch3mical> I think without them it delays the function or something, I'm not entirely sure what the difference is, but I know that with () it should always fire immediately (when it's called, i.e. hoverin and hoverout appropriately)
[08:34:47] <ch3mical> That's the theory anyway
[08:35:14] <ch3mical> Phoenixz: is the form filled out?
[08:35:22] <gnarf> joikus: you can try changing the src attr again, but likely it will be "cached"
[08:35:44] <gnarf> joikus: add like ?1 or something to force it
[08:36:06] <Phoenixz> ch3mical: yes, I have "name" and "pass", using both the name="" and id=""...  weird thing is, it worked before, but now it doesnt.. the $('#formid').html() does show the form correctly, so the form selector should be okay
[08:36:40] <gnarf> Phoenixz: are the inputs children of the form?
[08:37:05] <guy> anyone?
[08:37:11] <Phoenixz> gnarf: <form><input name='email'><input name='password'></form>
[08:37:58] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, I tried the functions without () like you suggested and the menu just drops off to never return. I tried the () in the toggle events and it  messed everything up.
[08:38:06] <Phoenixz> gnarf: the actual form tag is <form id='signin' accept-charset='utf8'> , this should suffice, right? Since it doesnt have to do an actual submit (jQuery is doing that)
[08:38:11] <gnarf> Phoenixz: http://jsfiddle.net/FVLJJ/20/
[08:38:23] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: No I wasn't saying without
[08:38:39] <Whirl3d> *with, sorry
[08:38:45] <Whirl3d> I tried it both ways
[08:38:49] <ch3mical> $('#headerPanel').hover(showMenu, hideMenu); this is what you have, this is what i was suggesting: $('#headerPanel').hover(showMenu(), hideMenu());
[08:38:55] <ch3mical> Or try
[08:39:11] <Whirl3d> tried that way, had the dropoff never return effect
[08:39:12] <Fox`> ;)
[08:39:16] <ch3mical> $('#headerPanel').hover(function() { showMenu }, function() { hideMenu });
[08:39:22] <janthony> Is there a way to do an archive rewrite for posts, kind of like you can do with a custom post type when registering it with rewrite?
[08:39:26] <Whirl3d> lemme try that.
[08:39:38] <gnarf> ch3mical: that will fail
[08:39:45] <gnarf> ch3mical: both options
[08:39:53] <ch3mical> gnarf: why?
[08:40:20] <janthony> i.e. i can add rewrite => array('slug' => 'reviews') for my custom post type, and when I go to myblogurl.com/revriews, it will load the archive.php template for that post type. Is there a way to do this with posts?
[08:40:22] <ch3mical> I've never called another function from an event function, but it seems syntactically correct
[08:40:26] <gnarf> ch3mical: the first --- showMenu() hideMenu() call the functions and put their return values as the hovers... unless those functions are returning event handler functions - it wont do what you want
[08:40:41] <Phoenixz> gnarf: checking..
[08:40:46] <gnarf> the second option function() { showMenu } is basically a no operation function...
[08:40:51] <Whirl3d> same thing with the (), disappears immediately
[08:40:57] <ch3mical> gnarf: the problem is the showMenu() etc functions themselves, then?
[08:41:09] <gnarf> ?js function test() { console.log("test") };   test
[08:41:10] <bot-t> gnarf: <function test() {console.log("test");}>
[08:41:23] <gnarf> notice, that doesn't actually execute test, it just references it
[08:41:42] <SuRfDeMoN> hi, is there a way to have a site ask a user a question and then remember the answer while the user is on the site but then forget when the user leaves, so it will ask them again when they come back?
[08:42:03] <ch3mical> gnarf: right, that's the problem I thought was caused by not having the () on the function call
[08:42:10] <Whirl3d> +gnarf, http://www.ldwolfe.net/test/menuTest.html
[08:42:40] <ch3mical> gnarf: which is why I told him to try with ()
[08:42:47] <Whirl3d> +gnarf, this all started because I noticed that as soon as I added opacity to an animation, it would fade out, but the position broke.
[08:42:54] <gnarf> ch3mical: sometimes you want to pass the function itself, not execute -- like when you are binnding....
[08:43:31] <ch3mical> gnarf: and that's why I later suggested putting it in an anonymous function, but he still needs to put (), right?
[08:43:39] <ch3mical> on the showMenu
[08:43:40] <Whirl3d> and then in trying to produce a working model of the problem, I made all kinds of weird things happen. LOL
[08:44:21] <ch3mical> So, $('whatever').hover(function() { showMenu(); },function() { hideMenu(); }); ?
[08:44:25] <janthony> Anyone?
[08:44:36] <ch3mical> Should that work?
[08:44:38] <gnarf> ch3mical: and now, that makes even less sense, but might work...
[08:44:55] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, that doesn't work either. It drops off completely never returns
[08:45:27] <ch3mical> What happens if you take the contents of those show/hide functions and drop it in an anonymous functions straight in the bind?
[08:45:29] <gnarf> the only difference between .hover( showMenu, hideMenu ) and what you have is that showMenu and hideMenu will never get passed the "event" param, and won't be called in the context of the hovered element
[08:45:50] <ch3mical> $('whatever').hover(function() { code here },function() {code here});
[08:45:53] <gnarf> ch3mical: that is equivalent to defining showMenu and passing it
[08:46:22] <ch3mical> gnarf: alright, well what is the CORRECT method? lol
[08:46:38] <gnarf> .hover( showMenu, hideMenu )
[08:46:45] <gnarf> and debug the actual funcitons that are breaking
[08:46:45] <ch3mical> I usually just use anonymous functions with the code directly inside
[08:46:46] <janthony> Oh wrong channel, my bad.
[08:47:00] <gnarf> ch3mical: ever feel bloated?
[08:47:07] <ch3mical> Right now I do ;)
[08:47:17] <ch3mical> gnarf: what are you getting at?
[08:47:19] <Phoenixz> gnarf: ch3mical: gottit, I accidentally had a double "id" attribute..
[08:47:36] <ch3mical> Phoenixz: good debugging
[08:47:38] <gnarf> Phoenixz: nice find
[08:48:05] <gnarf> ch3mical: that anonymous functions are awesome, but have their places... if you have a function in a function in a function you're prolly doing it wrong
[08:48:22] <gnarf> we don't wanna reinact inception with anonymous functions
[08:48:30] <EdwardIII> that's where you're wrong heh
[08:48:42] <ch3mical> gnarf: are you implying it's bad to do .hover(function() { some code },function() { some other code }); when you don't plan to use the "some code" anywhere else?
[08:48:45] <ch3mical> reuse*
[08:48:49] <Phoenixz> gnarf: Question (for best practices).. it is best only to assign "id" attribute to html tags that I'm somehow going to use in jQuery (and just maybe in CSS), right?
[08:49:04] <EdwardIII> i've got this sexy little ditty: http://www.pastie.org/1932264
[08:49:15] <EdwardIII> but how can i make it so the 'click' is on the li rather than the a?
[08:49:31] <ch3mical> and by "some code" I mean it's not just a function call, it's the code itself
[08:49:36] <gnarf> ch3mical: i'm not saying its bad, I'm saying organizationally, it usually makes things read better if you define them as functions first, then bind them
[08:49:55] <EdwardIII> if i just chop back the .find( to "li" then i can't get the 'href' - but once i'm inside the function i'm not sure how to drill down to it
[08:50:10] <littulb> is jsfiddle down???
[08:50:12] <Whirl3d> +gnarf I just stripped everything out and wrote a simple animate in and out function that should animate both position and opacity--doesn't work: http://www.ldwolfe.net/menu-opacity.html
[08:50:14] <gnarf> Phoenixz: *shrug* :)
[08:50:22] <gnarf> Whirl3d: 1.6.0?
[08:50:29] <ch3mical> gnarf: hmmm ok. Something to consider.
[08:51:14] <ch3mical> Phoenixz: there's nothing wrong with putting IDs on just about anything
[08:51:48] <ch3mical> Phoenixz: you never know if you end up wanting to easily reference that element by ID later, so why not?
[08:51:50] <littulb> anyone else having issues with jsfiddle.net?
[08:52:06] <gnarf> Whirl3d: cuz i just tracked down an animate issue with opacity defined as the last property causing things to stop working
[08:52:14] <ch3mical> littulb: looks to be down
[08:52:38] <ch3mical> gnarf: yeah 1.6
[08:52:42] <Phoenixz> ch3mical: Thing is, you can easily end up with double id's.. specially on larger pages..
[08:52:48] <gnarf> ch3mical / Whirl3d try 1.6.1
[08:53:03] <Whirl3d> gnarf, so what is the appropriate live link to the latest version?
[08:53:04] <ch3mical> Phoenixz: not if you give the IDs unique values

[08:55:27] <ch3mical> I have an issue where every time I load data into a table via AJAX, the table shifts a few pixels down... not sure what's going on there
[08:55:45] <littulb> ch3mical: yeah ... it takes about 3 mins to refresh
[08:56:53] <EdwardIII> the object 'this' doesn't seem to have access to 'parent'
[08:57:14] <ch3mical> Try $(this)
[08:57:46] <JeanM> How come this works: $("div").filter("[contenteditable=true]") but this doesn't (i.e. it only applies the filter to the last element): $("div, span").filter("[contenteditable=true]")? Feels like a bug, or am I missing something?
[08:58:46] <ch3mical> Only one has that attribute?
[08:59:04] <gnarf> JeanM: [contenteditable="true"] help?
[08:59:51] <JeanM> ch3mical: well, what I really want is to _only_ return the div or span if it has the contenteditable=true attribute, so yes some don't have it, but they are still returned.
[09:00:34] <ngnp> Some of my LI are visited twice with $ul.find('li.expanded').each(function()   .. any ideas?
[09:00:38] <JeanM> gnarf: still no go
[09:01:15] <gnarf> wow jsfiddle is slow today
[09:01:37] <JeanM> this is what is returned as the selector, which shows jquery isn't applying the filter properly to all elements: "div, span.filter([contenteditable=true])"
[09:01:47] <JeanM> this way, it selects all divs, and only filters the span?
[09:02:10] <gnarf> JeanM: http://jsfiddle.net/MY8L2/2/
[09:02:28] <gnarf> $("div,span").filter("[contenteditable='true']")
[09:02:34] <JeanM> gnarf: Yes, it works for a single attribute, but not two or more
[09:02:44] <gnarf> or $("div[contenteditabe='true'], span[contenteditable='true']")
[09:03:09] <gnarf> always - and i mean ALWAYS - use quotes for attribute selectors btw
[09:03:33] <JeanM> gnarf: that works, but I need to check 10 elements (div, span, h1, h2, h3, etc) so I want to use filter if possible
[09:03:43] <gnarf> JeanM: so use the filter
[09:03:58] <JeanM> gnarf: but it doesn't work on multiple selectors...?
[09:04:16] <gnarf> JeanM: $("div,span").filter("[contenteditable='true']")
[09:04:38] <gnarf> i dunno what "div, span.filter([contenteditable=true])" is supposed to be, but its not a css selector :)
[09:04:58] <JeanM> gnarf: nope, doesn't work
[09:05:11] <JeanM> I didn't type that, it's what's returned as the selector in the console: "div,span.filter([contenteditable='true'])"
[09:05:43] <Kambfhase> o.O
[09:06:01] <gnarf> JeanM: prove it... http://jsfiddle.net/MY8L2/3/
[09:06:13] <gnarf> JeanM: seems to work to me
[09:06:24] <gnarf> ?doesn't work

[09:35:04] <bigman_randy> can anyone help me with this? http://pastie.org/1932455
[09:35:26] <bigman_randy> The first part works, it breaks on the rollover
[09:37:36] <innociv> I'm a bit confused about ui autocomplete.
[09:38:03] <innociv> I have hundreds of tags, so I guess I should use ajax?
[09:38:04] <innociv> but...
[09:38:13] <innociv> Does it cache or what?
[09:38:28] <innociv> I don't want a new ajax request every time you type in a new letter.
[09:38:38] <innociv> it should just pull out the "a"s "b"s so on.  How would I do that?
[09:39:48] <djQuery> innociv: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[09:40:20] <innociv> Oh I was looking at the wrong section
[09:40:45] <innociv> .. yeah it does an ajax request every keypress? That's TERRIBLE.
[09:41:07] <innociv> If you type "ab" you have 4 results.  Why would it do another request instead of just narrow down from those 4 results?
[09:41:22] <innociv> Is there an autocomplete that works better?
[09:41:33] <guy> quick help needed
[09:41:34] <guy> http://guy.lt/gideon/
[09:41:41] <guy> press "Sign up or Sign in"
[09:41:46] <guy> then the lightbox comes up.
[09:41:58] <guy> I need to bind .overlay element to close on click
[09:42:21] <guy> however, simple $('.overlay').click(function(){ $(this).remove() })
[09:42:38] <guy> will also be triggered when lightbox is clicked since it is within .overlay
[09:42:42] <guy> so how do I it?
[09:42:49] <Michael> http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[09:43:33] <innociv> $(".overlay").click(function(){ $(this).remove(); }); worked for me, guy
[09:43:39] <turbolihis> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/ check if the target is overlay
[09:43:49] <innociv> You must not be binding it after it's created.
[09:43:52] <bigman_randy> is there something wrong with this line?
[09:43:52] <bigman_randy> 		var matchTitle = $(this).child().child().attr("title");
[09:44:06] <guy> innociv: the problem is that (".overlay").click(); will also trigger when ligtbox element is clicked.
[09:44:46] <bigman_randy> it seems to breaking everything
[09:44:55] <bigman_randy> I can't even get an alert to run after this line;
[09:45:07] <djQuery> $('.overlay').click(function(e){ console.log(e);}); investivate e and you will see an attribute of e like e.srcEleement then you check if $(e.srcEelemtn).hasClass('.overlay')
[09:45:14] <innociv> guy, check if ev.target hasClass("overlay")
[09:45:42] <innociv> $(ev.target).hasClass("overlay")
[09:46:06] <innociv> or srcElement as it may be.
[09:46:44] <djQuery> innociv: I forget which one it is myself which is why I suggested do a console.log of it so you can investigate
[09:47:15] <djQuery> bigman_randy: ?children
[09:47:20] <djQuery> ?.children
[09:47:21] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[09:47:28] <innociv> Does anyone know an ajax autocomplete that's actually good?  Not something that queries the server EVERY keypress(or after you stop typing.)  If "ab" only returns 5 returns, it should search off that 5 results list not do another ajax request when you add more to it.
[09:47:31] <djQuery> ?.child
[09:47:32] <bot-t> parent > child: Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[09:47:36] <guy> did you mean currentTarget?
[09:47:43] <innociv> It seems ridiculous that I have to code a working autocomplete myself..
[09:47:52] <Ely2> hi how can I append the % sign only when he started to count, so in the beginning you don't see the % sign alone? http://jsfiddle.net/Ely2/ZVWKZ/
[09:47:52] <innociv> There can't not be one that works /correctly/ with how many there are.
[09:48:12] <djQuery> innociv: no you have to code a working automplete to work the way you want it to work
[09:48:20] <opalepatrick> not understanding loops in jquery/javascript could I get a hand with http://fiddle.jshell.net/pwmZH/ getting an output from getJSON?
[09:48:34] <bigman_randy> so is this more accurate?
[09:48:34] <bigman_randy> 		var matchTitle = $(this).children(["a"]).attr("title");
[09:49:02] <innociv> djQuery, I would think the way I want it to work would be the way everyone wants it...
[09:49:05] <trovster> Hi, does anyone have experience with jQuery Tool plugins? Specifically overlay (at this second in time). I want to be able programmitcally set the content in an overlay, then open it. (I am doing the click handling and ajax requests myself.
[09:49:14] <tman> what's up with z-index not working properly in ie
[09:49:16] <innociv> I can't believe no one has made a working plugin after all this time.

[09:50:43] <trovster> You have to escape then.
[09:51:07] <trovster> IDs with dots aren't a great idea. jQuery uses CSS selectors to target the DOM. in CSS dot is a class
[09:51:17] <djQuery> callumacrae: look at the explanation at the top of the selectors page. see ?selectors

[09:53:14] <Swimming_bird> what good is .live()? Seems much slower than $(document.body).delegate()
[09:53:55] <Kambfhase> Swimming_bird: it was before .delegate() and it binds to the document instead of a specific element
[09:54:23] <Swimming_bird> but it first has to do a query for that element. which is unneccisary
[09:54:52] <Kambfhase> correct

[09:57:23] <Swimming_bird> systemfault: live has to find whatever element you're looking for, whether it exists or not. delegate just has to "find" document.body then just applies sparkle to bubbled events.
[09:58:08] <systemfault> Swimming_bird: Yes and no.
[09:58:22] <systemfault> Swimming_bird: Don't forget that $ has two parameters.

[09:59:00] <systemfault> Swimming_bird: Anyway.. just check the src, delegate uses live.

[10:01:00] <systemfault> Kambfhase: Hehe :P
[10:01:45] <Swimming_bird> systemfault: lets say i do a live on ".foo". it has to crawl the dom (on older browsers) to find, or not, all instances of '.foo'. if you do $('body').delegate(".foo",...) should be way faster shouldn't it?
[10:02:13] <Kambfhase> depends on how you define "faster"
[10:02:36] <trovster> http://jsbin.com/epuru4 -- anyone got thoughts on this? The Validate plugin now doesn't apply required to inputs with required="required" because jQuery returns it as a boolean.

[10:25:00] <djQuery> Blueoak: yes without the css it wont hide changing your cancel to Cancel:Â function()Â {Â $(Â thisÂ ).dialog("destroy"Â );}  makes it go away
[10:26:21] <Blueoak> djQuery That works perfectly; but are you referring to the jQuery UI CSS file?
[10:26:55] <djQuery> Blueoak: yes
[10:27:26] <ravenzz> Blueoak http://jsfiddle.net/AL4QE/3/
[10:27:38] <ravenzz> the problem is that
[10:27:43] <ravenzz> Cancel..is a button too
[10:27:54] <KillGuta> What's the best plugin for styling <select>?
[10:28:04] <ravenzz> and you add     $('button').click(function() {    $('#dialog-confirm').dialog('open'); });
[10:28:14] <ravenzz> so it will never hidden
[10:28:49] <Blueoak> ravenzz Ahh, that's it! Thank you
[10:29:07] <ravenzz> Blueoak than replace destroy with close
[10:29:13] <ravenzz> -then +also
[10:29:14] <ravenzz> :P
[10:29:23] <Blueoak> ravenzz okay, thanks for your help
[10:31:00] <necromancer`brb> this might not be a jquery question...but if i have a function in a .each() loop within a .submit() call, and that function returns ANYTHING othe than false, why is it that the form submits?
[10:31:16] <necromancer> like why does the form.submit() action take that return false as a cue to just disregard the rest of the code??
[10:31:19] <necromancer> err return true
[10:31:43] <necromancer> here's my code: https://gist.github.com/983372
[10:31:57] <innociv> this autocomplete doesn't seem documented that well for me :/
[10:32:03] <innociv> For using an ajax request
[10:32:46] <ravenzz> necromancer 1st of all i suppose that you can use preventDefault() instead of return false
[10:33:57] <djQuery> necromancer: of use any 1 of a # of validation plugins
[10:33:58] <necromancer> hmm that wasn't working
[10:34:01] <ch3mical> necromancer: because that's what return false does
[10:34:11] <necromancer> oh i know
[10:34:11] <denysonique> hey guys, if I would like to chose elements which have a paritcular css value e.g. width==800, is the most appropriate way to filter them by using.filter with a css value checking callback?
[10:34:14] <necromancer> i need e.stopPropagation
[10:34:23] <denysonique> or there is a simpler way of doing this?
[10:35:17] <airstrike> so, i'm back
[10:35:20] <airstrike> from the past
[10:35:42] <opalepatrick> Can anyone give a hand with http://fiddle.jshell.net/pwmZH/ ? looping data returned from getJSON
[10:36:10] <windsurf_> what happens when you just pass an function to jquery, like $(function foo(){}); I just saw that usage and I don't get what it does
[10:36:14] <ch3mical> opalepatrick: that's an array, not JSON
[10:36:15] <airstrike> i have two select fields. i need to filter values in select #two based on the selected option in #one. i want #two to be reset to the first option everytime #one is changed.
[10:36:35] <Kambfhase> windsurf_: thats a shortcut for $(document).ready()
[10:36:36] <airstrike> the $.get() part works, the resetting, selecting, etc does not
[10:36:36] <ch3mical> ?g jsonlint @ opalepatrick
[10:36:37] <bot-t> opalepatrick, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[10:36:51] <windsurf_> Kambfhase: ah, thanks
[10:37:06] <opalepatrick> ch3mical, well thanks for that, that could explain a lot. Of to investigate
[10:37:12] <ravenzz> denysonique maybe $('div').filter(function(){ return $(this).width().match(/800/); })
[10:37:18] <ch3mical> opalepatrick: however, you can easily loop your data with $.each(data, function() { ...  });
[10:37:49] <denysonique> ravenzz: thanks, I was thinking about a similar solution just right now
[10:38:10] <ravenzz> you should try that, i am not sure
[10:38:24] <opalepatrick> I have tried all sorts of those types of loops but get nada. I better check that array as it is coming from a php json_encode
[10:38:54] <ch3mical> opalepatrick: must not be a 2D array that's getting json_encoded, then
[10:39:28] <opalepatrick> thanks ch3mical - I think it is because I triied to format it before encoding it.
[10:39:38] <opalepatrick> gonnsa have a mooch
[10:39:48] <ch3mical> o_O
[10:40:26] <Ely2> is it possible on first load to run a script and when the user refreshes the page another script is executed?
[10:41:13] <littulb> with .removeAttr(), how do you remove multiple attributes??
[10:41:21] <djQuery> Ely2: not with a pure javascript solution.
[10:41:35] <Ely2> ok
[10:41:38] <Ely2> what else do i need ? :p
[10:42:31] <djQuery> Ely2: the last thing in the script do an ajax request back to the server. have the server put in a session variable. test for the session variable on load of the page to see which script to load
[10:42:35] <Ely2> what i want to do is: i have a load that is running from 0 tot 68 and stops .. when a user reloads that page because he thinks the page is stuck the loader should run again but stopping at another number
[10:43:28] <ch3mical> Ely2: I'm sure you can easily accomplish this by setting a cookie
[10:43:43] <Ely2> i was thinking the same
[10:43:52] <Kambfhase> littulb: you need to call .removeAttr() for each attribute individually.
[10:43:53] <ch3mical> ?g jquery.cookie.js @ Ely2
[10:43:54] <bot-t> Ely2, Cookie | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[10:43:56] <Ely2> when cookie is first time change the end number, and so on :)
[10:43:57] <djQuery> Ely2: or give the user some indication that it is making progress bar so the user knows how much longer they need to wait
[10:44:22] <Ely2> well now djQuery it's a fake website
[10:44:24] <Ely2> something for a commercial
[10:44:39] <Ely2> the numbers and progress bar stop
[10:44:44] <Ely2> and nothing you can do but reload the page
[10:45:01] <Ely2> but to make it less fake other ending number after refresh
[10:45:26] <djQuery> then I would just use a cookie like ch3mical suggested
[10:45:37] <Ely2> ch3mical: do you tihnk i could make the end number be something else for 5 times ? maybe a callback after the end number is reached create acookie, when a user reloads the page the cookie changes the number
[10:45:42] <Ely2> should work i'll try that
[10:46:01] <Ely2> ok thx for the help :)
[10:47:05] <innociv> The heck. My autocomplete is as wide as the window, not the input
[10:47:15] <denysonique> ravenzz: console.log $('#myGallery').children().filter -> this.width == 800
[10:47:17] <djQuery> Ely2: so you are trying to prevent them from ever reaching the end? check to see if the cookie exists then just add to that #
[10:47:20] <denysonique> ravenzz: this did the trick for me
[10:47:33] <denysonique> ravenzz: CoffeeScript btw
[10:48:01] <Ely2> well they never reach the end because the end number is something i put by default
[10:48:12] <Ely2> but i could create cookie on load and one on reaching the end
[10:48:21] <Ely2> and put thatlast cookie everytime in place of the default end value
[10:48:27] <ravenzz> denysonique this.width == 800 within filter=
[10:48:28] <ravenzz> ?
[10:49:06] <denysonique> ravenzz: nope, it translates into .filter(function() { this.width == 800 })
[10:49:14] <Ely2> tricky but i'll try
[10:49:23] <ravenzz> yes
[10:49:29] <ravenzz> that's what i mean
[10:51:21] <ravenzz> denysonique http://jsfiddle.net/z3Df4/6/ it still don't work
[10:52:42] <carlodell> I think you need a return
[10:53:22] <ch3mical> Ely2: just set a cookie with nothing but an integer (1 the first time), then increase that integer every time.. do different things depending on what that integer equals when the page loads
[10:53:52] <ravenzz> it don't work both with and without
[10:54:14] <carlodell> What are you trying to do?
[10:54:56] <ravenzz> he would select each element of a specific width
[10:56:35] <ch3mical> something like function loadCookie () { if ($.cookie('iterations')) { cookie = $.cookie('iterations'); switch (cookie) { case "1": .. break; case "2" ... break; } $.cookie('iterations',++cookie); } else { $.cookie('iterations','1'); } }
[10:56:39] <ch3mical> Ely2: ^
[10:56:44] <Ely2> ah ok
[10:56:49] <carlodell> http://jsfiddle.net/z3Df4/6/
[10:56:59] <carlodell> @ravenzz
[10:57:00] <djQuery> ravenzz:   http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/z3Df4/8/
[10:57:02] <Ely2> i was just asking how i could + 1 each time on the cookie $.cookie("load", 1, expiredate);
[10:57:42] <ch3mical> You don't really need to supply expiration, unless you want to store it for more than 1 day (i think that's the default)
[10:58:46] <ravenzz> oh ok
[10:59:41] <ravenzz> djQuery that was my first idea, but i did something similar with $(this).width().match()
[10:59:41] <Ely2> ok
[10:59:44] <Ely2> well http://jsfiddle.net/Ely2/NSHVz/
[10:59:47] <Ely2> something more like this
[10:59:52] <Ely2> the loader unction is not included now
[11:00:24] <Ely2> ow the callback is not correct

[11:08:22] <Ely2> djQuery: what is it doing at the moment
[11:08:34] <Ely2> it's checking for something finding it and at the end adding 1 ?
[11:08:39] <lecsiy> So i assume its something to do with the datepicker
[11:08:59] <sokie_de> you cant, metap0d - cuz when javascript is started, all php had already happened
[11:09:04] <djQuery> Ely2: if the cookie doesnt exist it sets the var cookie = 1

[11:17:52] <Ely2> ow ok
[11:18:20] <djQuery> ner0x: download the git of jquery ui and see how they do thier testing. think they are using node.js though
[11:18:25] <Kambfhase> lecsiy: looks ok to me
[11:18:39] <ner0x> I've heard of Jasmine and Zombie.js . If anyone has any other ideas please let me know.
[11:18:40] <lecsiy> In whatt way?
[11:18:46] <djQuery> however testing in different browsers is gonna be a comercial app probably
[11:19:20] <Kambfhase> lecsiy: in that the ddatepicker appers when i foxus the input
[11:19:22] <ner0x> Just that jquery validate sends the right errors where they should be, page redirects, etc.
[11:19:36] <nail_> lecsiy: it's because of your css
[11:19:44] <nail_> the css you use for jquery-ui
[11:19:56] <nail_> normally ui-datepicker should be display: none;
[11:20:14] <ner0x> djQuery: Should I even bother testing the JS?
[11:20:27] <nail_> it's not in yours, so it gets a display block from the ui-helper-clearfix
[11:20:37] <lecsiy> I seee. So how could i get that to work seeing as my CSS is the hosted version on google.
[11:20:39] <nail_> looks like it's outdated :)
[11:20:46] <lecsiy> Hmmm
[11:20:59] <lecsiy> Does google host the CSS cause act were i found out it was on some forum
[11:21:12] <lecsiy> Maybe you could link me to the most current version?

[11:32:57] <BlackArts> Hey, any idea why this won't work? $.cookie("cartHtml", $('#cart').html());
[11:33:31] <ch3mical> Too big?
[11:33:41] <ch3mical> Try putting it in a var first
[11:33:47] <BlackArts> I have
[11:33:48] <Engin> sokie_de, if you mean lazyload.js that is for scripts
[11:33:50] <Engin> ?
[11:33:52] <BlackArts> but I get null
[11:34:03] <Engin> what I wonder is how to make this loading process non blocking
[11:34:23] <BlackArts> what's the limit of characters for cookie?
[11:34:28] <Engin> it is totally browser dependent... I request images from same host ... I suppose most browsers allow 4 connections per tab
[11:34:33] <Engin> and 1 or 2 connections to same host
[11:34:36] <sokie_de> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[11:34:43] <Engin> so all my image loads should occupy 1 or 2 connections
[11:35:01] <Engin> though I don't believe it is a bandwidth issue anyway, IE is not responding to mouse events
[11:35:15] <Engin> oh let me look at that
[11:35:32] <ch3mical> BlackArts: maybe $('#cart').html() is null
[11:35:54] <BlackArts> no, I added some products
[11:36:06] <BlackArts> and I'm trying to save html of thoose products
[11:36:23] <BlackArts> you can take a look

[11:36:31] <ch3mical> lol
[11:36:41] <sokie_de> we cant see your harddrive :-D
[11:36:43] <BlackArts> functions for saving cookie are on the bottom of custom_logic.js
[11:36:48] <BlackArts> sorry
[11:36:52] <BlackArts> wrong file

[11:38:10] <BlackArts> try adding couple of products by clickong on "dodaj" button
[11:38:21] <BlackArts> and than run cartHtmlSave()
[11:38:34] <ch3mical> BlackArts: I think it's too big to store in a cookie. Why don't you just store something like... what items and quantities?
[11:38:38] <fructose> djQuery: Looks useful, but it says that it just lets you consume vertical space first instead of horizontal space. I pretty much want to do the opposite, but without specifying width... just have it automatically keep vertical alignment
[11:38:40] <ch3mical> -_-
[11:38:45] <BlackArts> I was to lazy
[11:38:59] <ch3mical> Laziness is bad juju
[11:39:06] <BlackArts> I'm generating content from json
[11:39:18] <BlackArts> and I'm to lazy to write restore function XD
[11:40:48] <BlackArts> but still, I should be able to save the json object, since it only contains id and ammount of products, and It won't do either
[11:41:29] <BlackArts> try jsonCartCookieSave(); after adding a product, and than $.cookie("jsonCart")
[11:41:43] <ch3mical> No thanks
[11:41:44] <BlackArts> I get null
[11:41:50] <BlackArts> XD
[11:42:00] <BlackArts> no problem
[11:42:36] <ch3mical> Sorry, lost all motivation to help you when you said you were being lazy :)
[11:43:54] <Mazenwrq> hi
[11:44:04] <dtach> can anyone help me out with a damn IE8 error? its failing to use my Array, http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/ is the code bits problem is the .url part
[11:44:48] <Guest647> br?
[11:44:57] <BlackArts> I guess I'll have to write restore function after all -.-
[11:45:44] <Guest647> br?
[11:45:46] <Mazenwrq> i have question
[11:46:00] <BlackArts> ch3mical: but.. you are aware that lazines is the best thing for creative productivity, right?
[11:46:01] <sokie_de> just type it in
[11:46:02] * ch3mical sneaks away
[11:47:08] <Mazenwrq> i download accordion
[11:47:12] <sokie_de> if you find someone to fix your problems caused by your lazyness that is
[11:47:21] <Mazenwrq> from jqueryui
[11:47:22] <thm> how do I run a function when the user toggles a checkbox?
[11:49:11] <Mazenwrq> i download accordion from jqueryui
[11:49:13] <Mazenwrq> it very good. but how i can change the height to tab?
[11:49:13] <mixmasterxp> If I turn an anchor into an ajax link, how do i prevent the browser to redirect?
[11:49:23] <mixmasterxp> do I need to do: e.PreventDefault?
[11:49:39] <mixmasterxp> I used .click and $.get
[11:49:47] <coachz> hi
[11:50:31] <Mazenwrq> help me please
[11:50:50] <sokie_de> .click(function(e){ e.preventDefault() } will prevent your page being preloaded
[11:51:09] <coachz> Anyone know how set an end to my treeview expansion?  I can build my tree fine but it keeps looking to ajax for the next node when it reaches the end.   http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Treeview
[11:51:36] <sokie_de> *relaoded :-D
[11:51:45] <sokie_de> well my typing...
[11:55:22] <halcyon1234> I'd like to hide an element when the user clicks outside the element (in the same way JQueryUI Autocomplete hides the result list when you click elsewhere).  Is there a JQueryUI class I can give my element to make that happen automagically, or do I need to roll my own code on the $("body").mouseup handler?
[11:55:25] <clockwize> guys, I've made a little image preloader, is there any way
[11:56:18] <clockwize> guys, i'm preloading some images, i know they are loaded when the 'load' event is fired, is there any easy way to say 'once all X load events have been called....'
[11:56:21] <Engin> sokie_de, this looks amazing, thanks for the pointer, hope it will work good in practice :)
[11:57:45] <sokie_de> Engin you would've notice the mesage, doesn't work as expected in modern browsers
[11:57:58] <Engin> :O
[11:58:12] <sokie_de> just limit the usage to the IE and you'll be fine i guess
[12:01:35] <sokie_de> anyway, if it solves your problems for the IEs it'll be ok
[12:03:32] <snowBlind_> Hi, does anyone know if there's an issues with using addClass in IE9 and FF4? This code works great in Chrome, just not IE or FF4. http://pastebin.com/19uQUymD   When the user clicks a link <a href> it adds the 'selected' class to that link using the this keyword. Again, works in Chrome, but not IE or FF4. Any ideas? Thanks
[12:04:33] <snowBlind_> It also doesn't seem to work in Safari 5.05
[12:05:19] <Kambfhase> ?p @ snowBlind_
[12:05:20] <bot-t> snowBlind_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:05:56] <snowBlind_> What's that kambfhase?
[12:06:01] <snowBlind_> Oh, nevermind.
[12:06:06] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:06:07] <snowBlind_> triggering the bot..  let me go post in jsfiddle
[12:06:19] <snowBlind_> (haven't been on irc much lately)
[12:08:57] <sokie_de> snowBlind, you could just used teh '#heading li a' selector for removing. this way you simply cant select a wrong child.
[12:09:53] <TuxIce> How can I change the content of a <div> with jquery?
[12:10:06] <innociv> .html()
[12:10:14] <TuxIce> thnx
[12:10:21] <sokie_de> ?replaceWith @TucIce
[12:10:21] <bot-t> TucIce, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[12:12:24] <snowBlind_> Sokie_de: If I change it to #heading li a, and change children to siblings, it doesn't remove the class.
[12:12:54] <innociv> replaceWith would change the div, not its contents
[12:13:53] <sokie_de> as i see your function, you add a class to that element clicked on (this <a>) so simply remove that class from the a elements (not siblings nor children)
[12:14:35] <snowBlind_> Ok, I see what you mean.
[12:14:42] <sokie_de> ;)
[12:16:11] <snowBlind_> sokie_de: Will the function work through the list of things I have in order, or at random?
[12:17:09] <snowBlind_> sokie_de: I have the removeClass on top, and then $(this).addClass after it.. however it seems the first button I click works correctly (has the selected class), then if I click another links the class is removed as it should be. However, the next link I click doesn't stay lit up (from having the selected class applied to it).
[12:17:53] <rasher> I'm in what seems to be a common situation in that I want to encode a date as JSON (which has no date type, of course), and do as little work as possible to load it with getJSON and end up with a Date javascript object. What's the preferred route to go to do this?
[12:17:53] <sokie_de> you first need to remove the class "selected" from ALL <a> Elements of your collection - then addClass("selected") to the element clicked on ($(this)
[12:18:20] <juha___> anyone done text borders with css?
[12:18:39] <sokie_de> well if you reload the pace, your previous action are discarded

[12:21:25] <ah||> Hi@all, is it a knwond feature that .serialize() doesn't serialize the actual content but the initial one? I didn't find any hint about that in the net...
[12:22:08] <ah||> I mean the serialize function from the jquery UI.
[12:25:59] <halcyon1234> I whipped up a quick bit of code that, when the user clicks anywhere, it will hide all ".ui-auto-hide" elements (except for the ui-auto-hide that was clicked on).  Is there anything particularly stupid about it?
[12:26:00] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/h5dMf/
[12:26:43] <ch3mical> You mean other than the fact that it doesn't work?
[12:27:30] <Kambfhase> halcyon1234: .not() takes a native element as an argument.
[12:27:46] <halcyon1234> ch3mical:  Well, that'd be something.  I'm in FF3.6, and it seems to work. Whatcha using?
[12:28:27] <Kambfhase> halcyon1234: you do not follow the javascript code conventions, like declaring variables with var
[12:28:40] <Kambfhase> or puttin { on the same line as if
[12:29:03] <halcyon1234> Kambfhase: Normally I do, this was a very quick throw together to see if it'd work.
[12:29:22] <Kambfhase> well it doesnt
[12:29:35] <rasher> For the record, http://blog.activa.be/index.php/2010/03/handling-dates-in-json-responses-with-jquery-1-4-the-easy-way/ seems to be working for me
[12:30:25] <ch3mical> halcyon1234: It does work, it was because I wasn't clicking in the "body"... I changed $("body") to $(document) and it works much better... nice work
[12:30:52] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: You don't have to declare variables with var, unless you want them to remain in scope
[12:31:07] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: declaring it without var just means it becomes global
[12:31:20] <ch3mical> (if it's not already defined)
[12:31:21] <halcyon1234> ch3mical:  I thought it might be that. I noticed it only worked when I was clicking in the table. That whole jsfiddle whitebox doesn't count as the body. I'll update to $(document), thanks for the test.
[12:31:47] <ch3mical> halcyon1234: is this a potential plugin, or something?
[12:32:01] <Kambfhase> ch3mical: that is ... wrong. (sometimes)
[12:32:02] <halcyon1234> ch3mical: Yup, I learned about scoping the hard way:  I made a recursive function that used an inner loop counter with a global scope. That was a frustrating afternoon. =)
[12:32:22] <halcyon1234> ch3mical: I wouldn't mind making it into a plug in. I'm starting to get into plugin development, so it'd be good practice.
[12:33:28] <halcyon1234> Now with $(document):   http://jsfiddle.net/h5dMf/2/
[12:34:25] <Kambfhase> ch3mical: you are wrong in es5 strict mode. plus you cannot declare a variable without var.
[12:35:29] <Kambfhase> or maybe you can if you count let
[12:35:45] <dtach> i know its going to sound weird but is it possible to have info about the post in the actual post? like a php tag? i want to show the post date in an element in the post, but i cant use the template (i do host the wordpress myself)
[12:35:49] <dtach> woops
[12:35:51] <dtach> can anyone help me out with a damn IE8 error? its failing to use my Array, http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/ is the code bits problem is the .url part
[12:35:58] <dtach> iv been trying to figure it out all day
[12:36:00] <halcyon1234> Kambfhase:  Like all things Javascript, it's wrong except when it isn't (and even then it is, sometimes, but not always-- maybe)
[12:36:39] <Kambfhase> halcyon1234: haha, n1 gonna tweet that!
[12:37:00] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: sorry, you're wrong... please read: http://www.mredkj.com/tutorials/reference_js_intro_ex.html
[12:38:39] <ajpiano> ch3mical: are you saying that implied globals are somehow a good idea to use in your code, and that using var to create a local variable is some kind of special case?
[12:38:50] <Kambfhase> ch3mical: the last update of that tutorial is from 2006. which means stone age in internet times.
[12:38:51] <ch3mical> ajpiano: not at all
[12:38:56] <ajpiano> oh ok, phew :)
[12:39:11] <ch3mical> ajpiano: just defending the position that declaring without "var" is "ok"
[12:39:22] <ajpiano> well that is not something you should be doing either ;)

[12:39:53] <ch3mical> Just saying you can, not that you should
[12:40:23] <ajpiano> personally i think that if you really really really really want to set a global variable, to use window.whatever to  make it clear what your intention is
[12:40:48] <Kambfhase> declaring withou var is not declaring. afaik. Its morre like Setting a prop on the global object.
[12:41:01] <ajpiano> yah
[12:41:11] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: it's just an example illustrating variable being declared without "var", sorry to jolt your internet fashion sense with "stone age" websites ;)

[12:43:04] <CoolCoder> i am not getting the right function for this
[12:43:43] <Engin> hmm it turned out that it is not the loading of images that stalls the IE...
[12:44:01] <Engin> should figure out what is causing the freeze... I'm only doing element insertion actually
[12:44:06] <Engin> like 160x5 elements
[12:44:08] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: agreed
[12:44:08] <Engin> too much ?
[12:44:43] <sokie_de> oh, so lazyload doesn't fix anything, Engin?
[12:45:09] <Engin> i looked at its code and and decided to apple to core logic to myself... since it is not doing anything special
[12:45:18] <sokie_de> i don't thing its the "attaching" part, its the rendering
[12:45:24] <Engin> it is merely putting src attribute on demand, nothing special to make it async or something like that
[12:45:32] <Engin> the funny thing is, it is not rendered
[12:45:44] <ch3mical> Engin: it's because if you're using a loop to do that, the browser is not free to do anything else during that
[12:45:49] <Engin> it is another hidden "carousel slide" of mine
[12:46:13] <Engin> ch3mical, you are suggesting that inserting that elements takes several seconds
[12:46:32] <Engin> but that's precisely how it looks like -- though it shouldn't

[12:46:46] <Engin> manipulating DOM tree shouldn't be that expensive
[12:47:01] <ajpiano> Engin: creating 800 elems at once could potentially be slow
[12:47:07] <ch3mical> Engin: it's not asyncronous, and yes it would be slow
[12:47:08] <ajpiano> and manipulating dom tree is one of the more expensive things you can do
[12:47:11] <K1ng> hi
[12:47:15] <Engin> it is zero overhead in chrome and ff
[12:47:17] <Kambfhase> make sure you manipulate a fragment, 800 times and then include that into the dom

[12:48:16] <K1ng> thanks
[12:48:44] <sokie_de> so you think it's better just to create the html for those images, and insert that 'in whole' into the DOM, ch3mical?
[12:48:55] <ch3mical> Absolutely
[12:49:27] <ch3mical> If you can't have it on the page in advance, you might look to php or something serverside
[12:49:32] <ch3mical> Then just load the whole chunk
[12:50:27] <sokie_de> so you might have your solution afterall, Engin
[12:50:34] <Engin> yup
[12:50:35] <ch3mical> If you were talking a dozen images it wouldn't be a problem. Or if each image was asyncronously loaded it would be less of a problem... but probably the best way is to load it all as one chunk

Has anyone managed to make the datepicker be in the correct size while being used in a css framework? I do have searched the web for a solution, but I have not found any solution (yet)
[13:32:20] <Coderiffic> @occi - are you using jquery for anything else in that piece of code/page?  Perhaps it's not even loaded?  does typeof($) == "function" return true?  what about typeof(jquery) == "function" ?
[13:33:07] <Occi-> hmm - do I have to have the <script>-loader below the html-code maybe? it's in the head now

[13:33:50] <reedyseth> have any of you use jQuery inside of Wicket (wiquery) ??
[13:34:33] <Coderiffic> all that matters is that the load of the jquery library happens before the call to the $().css() function

[13:44:38] <Ely2> it won't :p
[13:44:44] <Kambfhase> ok
[13:44:50] <Kambfhase> too bad
[13:44:57] <Ely2> invalid asignment :D
[13:45:09] <Kambfhase> i though that was a typo :|
[13:45:40] <Ely2> >_>
[13:45:44] <Ely2> anyway == works :)
[13:45:59] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:46:29] <reedyseth> come on guys, have any of you use jQuery inside of Wicket (wiquery) ??
[13:46:53] <Occi-> does document.getElementById("login") return null even if it's found? if not, what would it give if it is found (testing with alert)?
[13:48:34] <Kambfhase> Occi-: a) if an alement with the id "login" exists it will be returned b< document.getElementById()
[13:48:40] <Kambfhase> b) alert is not a debugger
[13:49:14] <jeffsmykil> match() is javascript not specifically jquery?
[13:49:43] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: if you mean .match() on strings, then yes.
[13:50:12] <jeffsmykil> doing val().match(/regex/) Kambfhase
[13:50:24] <Kambfhase> yeah, thats native.
[13:50:43] <jeffsmykil> any reason it would work with jquery 1.5.1 but not 1.4.1?
[13:51:43] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: are you sure that .val() returns a valid string? and not null or something crazy
[13:52:06] <Engin> <div onclick="foo(this)"> this is Window ?
[13:52:13] <Engin> I'd expect it to be div :)
[13:52:38] <ngharo> yucky
[13:53:51] <ngharo> Engin: $(div).click(function() { })
[13:54:05] <Occi-> ok Kambfhase - does javascript/jquery have any var_dump-like function or something else that is better to use than alert() ?
[13:54:15] <Engin> yeah but I'M generating a bunch of html and inserting it via .html()
[13:54:20] <Kambfhase> ?ftj @ Occi-
[13:54:21] <bot-t> Occi-, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:54:21] <Engin> and that onclick is in that string
[13:54:24] <Kambfhase> readd that.
[13:54:26] <ngharo> ?delegate @ Engin
[13:54:27] <bot-t> Engin, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:54:56] <bakers> What do you guys use to detect if console.log isn't supported? I'd like to prevent older IE from throwing an error, but still works in IE8+
[13:55:00] <ngharo> Engin: but to answer your question, this should be div in your example
[13:55:18] <Engin> yeah looks promissing
[13:55:30] <Ely2> if i use var $procent = $('.procent').append('%');
[13:55:34] <Ely2> can i just $procent alone ?
[13:55:40] <Ely2> or does it need more to function ?
[13:55:49] <ngharo> bakers: if(typeof console === 'object') ..
[13:56:35] <Kambfhase> bakers: you might want to have a look at
[13:56:37] <Kambfhase> http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[13:56:45] <skylamer> ely2 u can use CSS for that ?
[13:57:07] <Ely2> actually just html
[13:57:09] <Ely2> my bad :o
[14:01:01] <Engin> I think i misdiagnosed this situation again
[14:01:04] <Engin> many times!
[14:01:23] <Engin> first I though IE was stalling because of img loading...
[14:01:40] <Engin> then I though it is DOM manipulation
[14:01:58] <ch3mical> Ely2: good job on that page... however it looks like it doesn't update the cookie unless you let the "loading" finish... if I refresh the page before it's done counting up it doens't increase the cookie value. Just FYI. Don't know if you need it to do that or not
[14:02:15] <Engin> now I've supposedly fixed the DOM manipulation expense -- but I forgot that during that IE freeze there was no CPU consumption of IE... hence that shouldn't be the reason
[14:02:22] <Ely2> well it would be good if it did
[14:02:27] <Ely2> i can creat the cookie at the beginning
[14:02:30] <Ely2> ofcourse
[14:02:34] <Ely2> an not at the end in the callback
[14:02:56] <ch3mical> Definitely. Also apparently the cookie value is sometimes null
[14:03:04] <ch3mical> Doesn't seem to break the functionality, though
[14:03:10] <Ely2> it loops
[14:03:17] <Ely2> null 1 2 3 null 1 2 3
[14:03:19] <Engin> any idea how to diagnose this IE problem
[14:03:27] <ch3mical> ok
[14:03:39] <Ely2> it will be till 5 and loops al over
[14:03:41] <Engin> now I'm inserting almost all DOM elements at once as string... and there's no img to be loaded... still it freezes
[14:03:42] <Ely2> nothing more needed for this
[14:03:57] <Kambfhase> Engin: is your site online?
[14:04:14] <Engin> it is very complicated, in short you can't look at it
[14:04:29] <Kambfhase> which IE are you testing in?
[14:04:34] <Engin> 8
[14:04:38] * ch3mical goes back to lurking
[14:04:43] <Ely2> :D
[14:04:46] <ch3mical> ;)
[14:04:52] <Ely2> sorry i unlurked you :D
[14:05:26] <Kambfhase> ok, I have two ideas, a) you manipulate the dom in the page b) your strings suck
[14:05:50] <Engin> there's no CPU consumption
[14:07:24] <michaelt1> http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/160669/160669,1279288811,1/stock-photo-business-man-eating-a-computer-57501847.jpg
[14:07:48] <Ely2> ch3mical: fixed ;) http://amessos.yougodigital.be/
[14:07:49] <Ely2> cheers
[14:10:18] <Engin> holy shit whole IE is frozen
[14:10:24] <Engin> including the menus etc
[14:10:38] <Engin> I've ended up coding a malware!
[14:11:47] <Kambfhase> Engin: welcome to JavaScript!
[14:12:18] <solsTiCe> hi. When I swithc to jquery 1.6.1, some code does not work. the one involving .attr(). It was supposed to wrok as before from what I read in the changelog. It is not the case. Even if I use .prop() instead =, it still does nto work. it breaks in another way.
[14:14:20] <AaronCampbell> Does anyone know whats going wrong when you get an error like "jQuery161060048468496140251305925163793 is not defined"?  It's being caused from a call like jQuery.getJSON('http://api.example.com/?callback=?', function (data) { /*do something with data*/ });
[14:14:29] <AaronCampbell> using jQuery 1.6.1
[14:15:43] <Kambfhase> ?p @ solsTiCe
[14:15:44] <bot-t> solsTiCe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:18:26] <solsTiCe> most of the time the bug is. it works the first time ad the follwoing time when checking/uncheking a checbox
[14:18:34] <solsTiCe> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/392469/ just a snippet
[14:19:23] <solsTiCe> the first time remvoeProp works. the next time it does not. when the checkebox is checked
[14:20:36] <skylamer> AaronCampbel yty newer version
[14:21:27] <solsTiCe> what is supposed to happen when you removeProp a prop that is not set/true ...
[14:21:46] <Kambfhase> solsTiCe: i doubt is you can remove the property checked
[14:22:00] <Kambfhase> fu, english >:(
[14:22:14] <Kambfhase> do you want to set it to false?
[14:22:59] <solsTiCe> there is no jquery 1.6.1 on jsfiddle :-(
[14:23:11] <orolo> i need to add a sliding drawer just below a table header that shows up over the table; i'm thinking about getting the DOM pixel location of the TH and then absolutely positioning the drawer just below.
[14:23:38] <solsTiCe> Kambfhase: yes; Ok i set it to false instead
[14:24:00] <KWhat_Work> is there somewhere i can get more information on event properties specifically fromElement?  Is that the dom element that produced the event?
[14:24:28] <ravenzz> solsTiCe removeAttr('checked')
[14:24:29] <ravenzz> or .attr('checked', false)
[14:24:29] <orolo> how do i get the positions of that TH element?
[14:24:29] <ravenzz> ?
[14:25:01] <innociv> on jquery ui autocomplete, with the select event how do I see what was selected?
[14:25:23] <dtach> can anyone help me out with a damn IE8 error? its failing to use my Array, http://jsfiddle.net/RGcHT/ is the code bits problem is the .url part
[14:25:26] <orolo> innociv: i think it's either 'item' or 'this'
[14:25:53] <ravenzz> innociv http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete#events
[14:26:53] <orolo> ravenzz: ui.item it looks like in the custom-data example
[14:27:14] <orolo> oops
[14:27:23] <orolo> innociv:  ^^
[14:27:40] <solsTiCe> ok. better use prop('checked', false) than removeProp('checked')
[14:27:41] <ravenzz> innociv debut it
[14:27:54] <ravenzz> innociv debug sorry
[14:28:33] <ravenzz> dtach where is the html?
[14:29:25] <dtach> ravenzz: i added comments, its working perfectly in any browser but horrible IE, and the error is on the JS and my html is too big
[14:30:10] <dtach> when i make a test array IE8 doesnt error, but thats with a normal 1 'dimension' array
[14:30:15] <ravenzz> i can't test it without an html snippet
[14:31:13] <dtach> like i said the array is working, but i dont know why IE8 errors on it
[14:31:23] <SEJeff_work> Does anyone know how (in CSS), to have a container div that is anywhere on the page, but then have 2 rows of divs inside that container that are set with position: absolute, where they are offsets from the relative position of the container
[14:31:53] <SEJeff_work> I've got a div that has a picture of a cisco switch as the background, and am using small divs + position:absolute to put them over each port
[14:32:13] <SEJeff_work> Then I want to use jquery for elements inside of each "port"
[14:32:23] <dtach> ravenzz: i mean i understand showing a good example on JSfiddle but in this case i dont think its relevant since my code works in ANY other browser without error
[14:35:52] <ngharo> code is always relevant to debugging
[14:36:00] <innociv> Okay, one more problem.
[14:36:02] <ravenzz> dtach then try to debug trailersQ
[14:36:13] <mekwall> SEJeff_work: putting an absolute positioned element inside another absolute positioned element will place it according to the parent
[14:36:30] <ngharo> SEJeff_work: have you considered just floating fixed width/height divs inside your container
[14:36:39] <innociv> When I select in ui autocomplete I want to clear out the input and do something else, while jquery ui wants to copy the label/value of what's selected into the input.
[14:36:51] <innociv> So while my clear is working, it's just adding that value right after.
[14:37:08] <dtach> ravenzz: i read that it might be because of a trailing ',' at the end? but im not sure how to show my array in something to see if thats true? console.log(array); doesnt give me that, unless of course there really isnt a ',' at the end of the array
[14:37:20] <SEJeff_work> ngharo, Well The "port" divs need to be positioned exactly inside of the image
[14:37:31] <SEJeff_work> mekwall, I'll try that, thanks for the idea
[14:37:36] <mekwall> I'm on a boat!
[14:37:36] <innociv> ah ev.preventDefault works on select event.
[14:37:38] <innociv> That's cool.
[14:37:52] <SEJeff_work> mekwall, Riding on my dolphin doing...
[14:37:55] <AaronCampbell> Does anyone know whats going wrong when you get an error like "jQuery161060048468496140251305925163793 is not defined"?  It's being caused from a call like jQuery.getJSON('http://api.example.com/?callback=?', function (data) { /*do something with data*/ });
[14:37:57] <AaronCampbell> using jQuery 1.6.1
[14:38:10] <mekwall> SEJeff_work: Motherlover!
[14:38:26] <AaronCampbell> Someone earlier said "AaronCampbel yty newer version" but then disconnected and I have no idea what they meant
[14:38:51] <ngharo> AaronCampbell: that is the name of a jquery automagic jsonp callback method
[14:38:59] <ngharo> can you paste an example?
[14:39:13] <ravenzz> dtach yes a comma could cause that error
[14:39:31] <AaronCampbell> ngharo: jQuery.getJSON('http://api.example.com/?callback=?', function (data) { /*do something with data*/ });
[14:39:32] <ravenzz> but that's not your case
[14:39:50] <ngharo> AaronCampbell: you may want to try overriding the jsonp callback (see the docs)
[14:42:09] <ngharo> could be a problem with the webservice. have you compared the callback in the response with that sent in the request headers?
[14:43:31] <ravenzz> dtach maybe trailersQ should be an object to get his .url
[14:43:48] <Engin> fucking IE is driving me crazy
[14:43:58] <dtach> ravenzz: im sorry, be an object?
[14:44:11] <ravenzz> i'm not familiar with map()
[14:44:16] <dtach> hm
[14:44:29] <dtach> well its working in any other browser so i havent looked at it
[14:44:34] <dtach> i was just happy it worked
[14:45:22] <dtach> Engin: that makes two of us
[14:48:24] <Engin> I'm so disappointed, jeez
[14:48:39] <Engin> I put so much effort in this to make it PERFECT on IE, Chrome, FF
[14:49:05] <Engin> I thought I'd solve this IE freeze later... now it got worse!
[14:49:40] <ngharo> Engin: you could paste some code instead of complaining?
[14:52:31] <Engin> ngharo, :) after I do some more research I can take the trouble to make it more public
[14:52:46] <Engin> it is a facebook app, so it is quite some trouble to show it to you
[14:54:06] <ngharo> how much data are you inserting into the dom?
[14:54:56] <Engin> like 800
[14:55:29] <ngharo> you're writing to the DOM 800 times?
[14:58:16] <AaronCampbell> ngharo: It seems that the webservice only allowed /[a-z0-9]+/i in the callback.  In 1.4.4 that seemed to be fine, but in 1.6.1 it uses an _ in the callback as well.  Getting this fixed in the api, but do you know when that change occured?
[14:59:20] <ngharo> AaronCampbell: no sorry, i do not
[14:59:43] <ngharo> i'd contact the webservice though.  they're going to want to support native jquery no doubt
[15:00:00] <ngharo> kinda silly to strip _ when it's valid in JS
[15:00:04] <ch3mical> ^_^
[15:00:44] <ngharo> oh nm, i see you're on top of that :D
[15:02:46] <ch3mical> Engin: I hate IE :(
[15:02:56] <ch3mical> I wish I never had to support it.
[15:03:11] <ravenzz> dtach http://jsfiddle.net/29VCA/8/
[15:03:20] <systemfault> IE8 and later are fine :P
[15:04:03] <dtach> ravenzz: let me have a look thanks
[15:05:03] <ch3mical> systemfault: still have a lot of issues in 8.. 9 is better, but still not great
[15:05:04] <Engin> ngharo, no I'm writing very few times
[15:05:17] <Engin> and even when I did 800 times... there was no CPU consumption
[15:05:26] <Kambfhase> ZOMG RAPTURE
[15:05:38] <systemfault> Are people dying yet?
[15:05:40] <AaronCampbell> ngharo: It was at api.wordpress.org, and we already rolled out a fix (in the last 5 minutes)
[15:06:06] <ravenzz> dtach finally i learn how map() works thank to your help ask :D
[15:06:20] <AaronCampbell> It's still interesting that jsonp callbacks didn't use to have an _ and now they ALL do...but I can't find the ticket where it happened.
[15:06:34] <Kambfhase> systemfault: people dont die on rapture day.
[15:06:46] <systemfault> Ah :/
[15:06:48] <ngharo> AaronCampbell: cool!  yeah "why fix it if it aint broken" right?
[15:06:53] <systemfault> Kambfhase: You're the pro, I'm not :/
[15:07:00] <Kambfhase> :)
[15:07:33] <Kambfhase> its the wother way round. Dead people come alive again.
[15:07:46] <systemfault> Ahhh
[15:07:49] <systemfault> Zombies then?
[15:08:17] <Kambfhase> yeah, but the fast ones.
[15:08:23] <ravenzz> just reincarnation
[15:08:32] <Kambfhase> + they dont eat brains
[15:08:44] <systemfault> So the movies lied to us?
[15:08:46] <systemfault> :(
[15:09:47] <systemfault> God killed Macho Man!
[15:09:50] <ch3mical> Damn you, John Romero!
[15:09:59] <ch3mical> Damn youuuu
[15:10:35] <ngharo> Engin: do you still get a long delay if you inject into a div with display:none?
[15:10:47] <Engin> it is already a div with display:none
[15:10:51] <dtach> ravenzz: im trying to apply it to my code now, thanks already :)
[15:11:32] <Engin> ok I've really nailed the delay... the delay happens when I do $('#foo').html(htmlchunk)
[15:11:34] <ravenzz> dtach you should check if it find what you are looking for
[15:11:40] <ravenzz> anyway
[15:11:59] <Engin> htmlchunk is like 22*4 elements
[15:12:25] <Engin> and the delay is like 4-5 seconds
[15:12:46] <Engin> whole IE freezes
[15:12:53] <Kambfhase> Engin: try $('#foo').detach().html(htmlchunk).appendTo(#foosparent)
[15:12:55] <ngharo> you could split them up and update loading status every call
[15:13:00] <Engin> including the menu etc the IE window becomes deresponsive
[15:13:09] <Engin> hmm
[15:13:14] <ravenzz> i'll whatch an x-files episode
[15:13:15] <ravenzz> bye
[15:13:24] <Engin> that could fuck ordering maybe but let's try
[15:13:50] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/VzCnJ/3/ This works just how I want it to in chrome, but in firefox it's adding an empty "addTag()" when you type something(like ja), then arrow down, and press enter to select
[15:13:59] <innociv> rather than submitting by a click, enter on the feild.
[15:14:16] <Engin> Kambfhase, it still freezes!
[15:14:18] <Engin> unbelievable
[15:14:36] <innociv> And my firebug isn't working in firefox 4.0..
[15:14:47] <systemfault> Then update.
[15:14:48] <Kambfhase> innociv: got the latest version?
[15:15:03] <innociv> I keep trying to install different versions and the console never works
[15:15:41] <innociv> the console shows GET requests and stuff, but not javascript errors
[15:17:38] <Kambfhase> Fx 4 give me jaclose whereas Chrome says javaclose
[15:18:09] <innociv> for me FF4 gives me javaclose close while chrome says javaclose(correct).
[15:18:45] <innociv> for me FF is appending a blank tab along with a correct one.  just your partial string is a new one for me
[15:21:50] <Kambfhase> innociv: i guess it has to do with the order the events get triggered
[15:23:19] <dtach> my site is an unbelievable wreck in IE8 :( while any other browser runs it 100% no errors or problems
[15:23:25] <innociv> That's why I put that bit in to check the events.  Not working how i want though apparently
[15:24:05] <Kambfhase> innociv: in chrome select will be trigger last, but in firefox one keypress follows the select
[15:24:24] <Whirl3d> good afternoon all. how do I remove the css attribute "left" from a div?   .removeAttr?
[15:24:49] <innociv> But I put a if ( $(this).val != '' ) in the keypress and if( ui.item.value != '' ) in the select event
[15:25:00] <innociv> Which fixed it in chrome, but not FF.
[15:25:13] <ngharo> Whirl3d: .css('left', '') i believe
[15:25:28] <ngharo> or whatever default is, inherit maybe
[15:25:33] <coldhead> .css('left', window)
[15:25:38] <coldhead> might work
[15:26:02] <Whirl3d> ngharo, I'll try it, thanks. Coldhead, I'll try yours second. Thanks as well.
[15:26:41] <innociv> i'm curious why the keypress of $("#autocomplete") is even firing on the ui-menu though..
[15:31:15] <Kambfhase> grml, why is there no good vector library for js?
[15:31:30] <innociv> Isn't there?
[15:31:49] <coldhead> isn't that what raphael is?
[15:32:18] <Kambfhase> no, i mean math :)
[15:32:41] <innociv> http://raphaeljs.com/ this isn't good?
[15:32:56] <innociv> Oh.
[15:32:58] <innociv> Too late
[15:33:04] <coldhead> you should write one that uses webGL to do the vector math on the GPU
[15:33:13] <coldhead> i would endorse that
[15:33:31] <Kambfhase> you mean, like http://blog.vlad1.com/2010/02/05/mjs-simple-vector-and-matrix-math-for-js/
[15:33:53] <Kambfhase> that one is pretty fast but fugly
[15:34:13] <coldhead> fix it fix it fix it!
[15:34:21] <coldhead> it seems like a promising start
[15:34:45] <Whirl3d> btw, ngharo, your solution worked perfectly. I finally am getting close to having the animation done. Now just the content/resizing/footerpanel/ etc. LOL
[15:34:58] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/test/mainTest-1.html
[15:36:47] <ngharo> wolf get out of the way, im trying to read
[15:37:09] <Kambfhase> lÃ¨ pwnz
[15:39:19] <Kambfhase> ar, fuckit, i rewrite my own
[15:39:44] <coldhead> itchy boob
[15:39:47] <innociv> why don't firebug 1.7.1 console report javascript errors in firefox4? D:  This is driving me crazy.
[15:40:28] <Kambfhase> innociv: it does for me. try ctrl+shift+k
[15:40:39] <Kambfhase> that opens the native cosnole though
[15:46:09] <blindMoe> is this a valid selector:  $('#order-items-grid table.items:not(thead, tfoot)')   ?
[15:46:20] <blindMoe> just want to get everything inside a table instead of the thead and tfoot elements
[15:47:27] <dtach> i know its adumb question but anyone see why this>> alert('url:'+ trailersQ[playIndex].url + qualitySetting +'p.mov'); << wouldnt work in IE8 but in ANY other browser it will
[15:47:48] <dtach> its just to test but i get the line it should create just fine in every single browser except IE
[15:48:00] <ngharo> blindMoe: looks legit.  else couldnt you just grab tbody instead of the not clause?
[15:48:13] <dtach> Message: 'trailersQ[...].url' is null or not an object
[15:48:28] <blindMoe> ngharo: good point.. let me look at the table structure and see if it properly uses tbody ( it is created by a widget )
[15:48:57] <Kambfhase> ?p @ dtach
[15:48:58] <bot-t> dtach, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[15:49:17] <Kambfhase> datch, also you might want to use a proper js console, see ?ftj
[15:49:17] <bot-t> datch, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:49:54] <dtach> i get no error or anything, and the alert/line works so does the rest of my code, EXCEPT in IE8
[15:50:01] <ngharo> paste!
[15:50:23] <ngharo> does ie8 have console obj?
[15:50:32] <dtach> i get an error when i tried
[15:50:33] <dtach> got..
[15:50:48] <dtach> maybe if i turn the dev tool on but it gives me the same 'useless' error
[15:51:11] <ngharo> maybe just just do a plain old for loop over the trailersQ array and compare across browsers
[15:51:12] <dtach> and its hard to see something's wrong with my code if it works in every single browser except theirs
[15:51:31] <ngharo> im guessing your problem lies where trailersQ is populated
[15:51:52] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/VzCnJ/7/ this isn't right.. at the bottom, the keypress function.  It logs "val" when I have if( (ev.which == 32 /*space*/ || ev.which == 13 /*enter*/) && $(this).val != '' )
[15:52:13] <ngharo> dtach: unless IE doesnt like [].foo syntax in which case you could try trailersQ[playIndex]['url']
[15:52:24] <dtach> iv only found some info that the error might mean it has a trailing ',' but im not sure how to find that out since console.log(array) doesnt show me that, just shows me whats inside
[15:52:50] <Engin> well, intersting... I copied the exact same str I'M html()ing
[15:52:58] <Engin> built a test case... and it works very fast on IE
[15:53:04] <Engin> as expected, to be honest.
[15:53:06] <djQuery> ngharo: it does if you have the developer tools open (f12)
[15:53:37] <dtach> ngharo: been trying all sorts of things all day seriously
[15:53:46] <ngharo> dtach: there ya go, console.log the array and compare
[15:53:50] <dtach> IE will always ruin the web
[15:54:31] <Engin> oh waittttttttttttttttttt
[15:54:39] <Engin> background has a giant sprite
[15:54:49] <Engin> maybe that's the reason
[15:55:06] <Engin> that 22*5 element, almost all has background-image which is a giant sprite
[15:55:21] <Engin> ie could be tthat dumb ?
[15:56:21] <Engin> exactly......
[15:56:29] <hobs> lol
[15:56:43] <Engin> good thing i finally nailed the culprit
[15:56:44] <Engin> now
[15:56:53] <Engin> I hope there's a workaround to this
[15:57:03] <Kambfhase> yeah, use Fx4
[15:57:12] <Engin> ff4 sucks worse
[15:57:26] <Engin> chrome is the unquestionable leader
[15:57:30] <Engin> anyway
[15:57:36] <ngharo> amen bro
[15:57:38] <Engin> any idea ?
[15:58:13] <Engin> my whole design depends on giant sprites
[15:58:16] <ngharo> im suprised so many devs are using ff4 primarly honestly.  I find firebug clumsy and slow
[15:58:21] <Engin> that i slice with css
[15:58:24] <sokie_de> browserdiscussion are neither here nor there - all visitors come with their browser of their choice
[15:58:42] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/VzCnJ/7/ why isn't "if( (ev.which == 32 /*space*/ || ev.which == 13 /*enter*/) && $(this).val != '' )" working in firefox?  It's continueing on when $(this).val == ''
[15:59:00] <Engin> I insist that only one browser engine should be left
[15:59:04] <pifantastic> innociv: val()
[15:59:05] <m0dmd> hello everyone.
[15:59:09] <pifantastic> it's a function not a property
[15:59:13] <innociv> oops lmao
[15:59:33] <sokie_de> yes most definately not trident
[15:59:37] <Engin> any idea on the problem ? where would be the correct place to look for a workaround ?
[15:59:45] <dtach> ngharo:it wont even show console.log(trailersQ) after its been created, just get the error on me using it below that
[16:00:31] <ngharo> dtach: you still haven't pasted any code ;)
[16:00:54] <dtach> cant believe how many hours itse been now :s on IE fault not mine since it works in any other browser :@
[16:01:04] <dtach> ngharo: because it;s huge
[16:01:08] <dtach> :x
[16:01:18] <dtach> but sure
[16:01:19] <ngharo> make a test case
[16:03:53] <dtach> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/NAwTE/ is pretty much it
[16:06:22] <dtach> Ie8 breaks before it gets to the good stuff so i dont even see what could influence it's decision to not work
[16:08:06] <dtach> all my code even works in that monstrosity that is Opera
[16:08:10] <dtach> im going nuts here
[16:09:35] <KWhat_Work> anyone notice that :selected doesnt work on radio buttons that are selected ?
[16:11:02] <pifantastic> KWhat_Work: :checked
[16:11:26] <KWhat_Work> pifantastic: that doesnt seem to work either with <input type="radio" name="gender" id="male" value="male" selected="selected"/>
[16:12:30] <pifantastic> KWhat_Work: ********checked
[16:12:33] <pifantastic> stop using selected
[16:12:50] <pifantastic> http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html
[16:12:56] <KWhat_Work> yah that doesnt work either
[16:13:16] <KWhat_Work> never mind firefox doesnt know what refresh means
[16:27:07] <cool123> can anyone fix the pagination problem if yes how much
[16:27:09] <cool123> http://www.clickstudio.info/edilalwebsite/search-result/
[16:33:16] <dtach> after i have given a div a class with addClass how can i target it? .originalClass.addedClass or .originalClass addedClass .. neither seems to work so im not sure if its me or im not using the right target
[16:33:30] <dtach> dev tool shows me class="originalclass addedclass"
[16:50:01] <Engin> omg
[16:50:03] <Engin> update
[16:50:11] <Engin> the reason is not the giant sprite
[16:50:19] <Engin> but some other css class!
[16:50:32] <Engin> with some tricks to display beautiful fonts
[16:50:35] <Engin> can you believe it !
[16:51:22] <MistuhKurtz>  I BELIEVE BROTHA

[17:20:42] <strike> Ã¶euyaha
[17:26:58] <iammerrick> Is there anywhere in the jquery docs that will show you what file a method is defined in for development?
[17:28:39] <ngharo> no
[17:29:04] <ngharo> grep or use the search in chrome scripts tab
[17:41:03] <quuxman> can jquery event functions be used for arbitrary objects?
[17:43:20] <ngharo> can you expand on that thought
[17:52:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[17:53:11] <ngharo> hellu
[17:53:41] <quuxman> ngharo: I just created a Funcs constructor that creates a function that calls a list of functions
[17:54:31] <ngharo> yo dawg i hear you like functions...
[17:55:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> yo dawg, i hear you like to debug other people's code
[17:55:03] <m0dmd> I heard functions make the world go round!
[17:55:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> how can i make it so clicking on the checkbox ALSO works: http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/yxPcQ/
[17:55:35] <ngharo> making things work is overrated
[18:00:34] <ngharo> ProLoser|Mobile: you're doing if(isChecked) { uncheck }
[18:00:38] <ngharo> which makes no sense??
[18:00:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> that's not the issue
[18:01:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm trying to only detect clicks that ARENT on the inputbox
[18:01:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> if you click on anything inside the <tr> except for a link or a input, it should work
[18:01:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> but it's still triggering the td event
[18:04:43] <jamesdean77> Hello fellow nerds
[18:04:57] <jamesdean77> How big can a jQuery.parseJSON be ?
[18:05:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> as big as your face
[18:05:46] <jamesdean77> Im getting a error when using a long string but short strings work
[18:05:50] <jamesdean77> missing ) after argument list
[18:06:03] <jamesdean77> ^ lols
[18:06:20] <ProLoser|Mobile> don't ask arbitrary questions for debugging without showing code
[18:06:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> we can't mead rinds
[18:07:10] <jamesdean77> Ummm ^ ks
[18:07:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> use jsfiddle
[18:08:17] <jamesdean77> Any place to error check json format
[18:08:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> i just ceck json in my browser
[18:08:41] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint
[18:08:42] <bot-t> coldhead, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[18:08:50] <woopwoop> hi, I need help figuing out what's the best way to do something like this? I wanna check an array for duplicates, and if there are, count them. eg var somearray = ['2', '2', '1', '2']; the function would find 2 as a duplicate, with a count of 3
[18:08:56] <jamesdean77> ^ hope they accept long string
[18:09:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> it doesn't sound like the length is the isue
[18:11:37] <jamesdean77> my json string is in one line cause jquery ony excepts one line json code as far as I can tell
[18:12:03] <jamesdean77> So Jsonlint just says error in line one. lols
[18:12:28] <wallerdev> can jQuery do ranges or something? like if i want the first 10 elements back from a selector?
[18:12:29] <ProLoser|Mobile> i don't know why you think jquery only accepts 1line json
[18:12:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> i don't even know what '1 line json' is
[18:12:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> since jsons an object
[18:13:04] <jamesdean77> Thanks for helping ^
[18:13:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> are you using \
[18:13:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> for multiline strings?
[18:13:34] <jamesdean77> I have my jason opject in one line
[18:13:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> nvm
[18:14:02] <wallerdev> ah the lt selector
[18:14:03] <ProLoser|Mobile> wallerdev:
[18:14:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> yes
[18:14:09] <jamesdean77> ^ would that not break JsonLint Validator
[18:14:21] <ProLoser|Mobile> iunno
[18:14:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> i don't know why you're trying to validate 1 line though
[18:14:36] <ProLoser|Mobile> you should break it apart and get back to us
[18:14:46] <ngharo> ProLoser|Mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/yxPcQ/2/ ??
[18:14:58] <jamesdean77> thought it would give me the char thats fing up
[18:15:10] <wallerdev> ProLoser|Mobile: thanks :)
[18:15:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> lol looks like you found it though
[18:15:50] <jamesdean77> br
[18:15:59] <MistuhKurtz> wallerdev, http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[18:16:36] <wallerdev> ProLoser|Mobile: well thanks for trying to help at least :)
[18:16:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> ngharo: is the stopPropagation the key?
[18:17:33] <ngharo> that's one way of doing it
[18:17:39] <ngharo> events bubble up the DOM
[18:18:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> but click won't detect a change event
[18:18:06] <ngharo> that prevents click event on input from reaching the other click handler
[18:18:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> like if you highlight the box and hit space
[18:18:26] <ProLoser|Mobile> nvm
[18:18:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> thanks though
[18:18:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> so what's the major advantage of delegate over live?
[18:19:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> sweeeet, thank you!!
[18:20:06] <ngharo> i like delegate cuz you can chain it
[18:20:18] <ngharo> but google for endless live vs delegate discussions
[18:21:40] <ProLoser|Mobile> chain it?
[18:21:53] <ProLoser|Mobile> i find it interesting that you used delegate deliberately to scope it to the form, which makes sense
[18:23:52] <ngharo> chain as in $(form).delegate('.foo', ...).delegate('.bar', ...)
[18:24:08] <wafflesburger> don't use delegate its slow
[18:24:13] <wafflesburger> as balls
[18:24:24] <ngharo> vs $(form .foo).live( .. ); $(form .bar).live( .. )
[18:24:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> wtf
[18:24:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> he joined and then left
[18:24:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> his delegate() sense must have been tingling
[18:25:01] <ngharo> lol
[18:25:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> is there any evidence to his claim?
[18:25:09] <ngharo> ?source function delegate
[18:25:10] <bot-t> (Result for ' ') Line#17 - "var document = window.document;" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#17
[18:25:22] <ProLoser|Mobile> 404
[18:26:00] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyway i understand you, thanks
[18:26:08] <ngharo> delegate calls live
[18:26:10] <ngharo> 		return this.live( types, data, fn, selector );
[18:26:25] <ngharo> so no, waffles is silly
[18:27:19] <ProLoser|Mobile> wtf something on my laptop won't stop making a noise
[18:27:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyone here use colloquy + mac?
[18:32:01] <jamesdean77> LOLs The JSON Data field can not exceed 300000 characters in length.
[18:32:08] <jamesdean77> http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
[18:37:17] <jamesdean77> Dam you jQuery.parse for not excepting multiline json objects
[18:38:32] <ProLoser|Mobile> why are you passing that much data?
[18:38:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> have you considered optimizing?
[18:40:00] <jamesdean77> Im trying to off load data from server to client
[18:40:12] <ProLoser|Mobile> i don't follow
[18:40:17] <ajpiano> why would you have newlines in a JSON
[18:40:18] <ajpiano> ?
[18:40:38] <jamesdean77> I will show ..................................
[18:40:56] <ngharo> the suspense!
[18:40:58] <snover> with that much of an ellipsis I bet you will
[18:41:09] <ajpiano> freal
[18:42:32] <jamesdean77> http://pastebin.com/syfQXXMv
[18:42:40] <jamesdean77> ^ lols
[18:42:46] <jamesdean77> you guys are fun
[18:42:49] <ajpiano> bra
[18:42:56] <ajpiano> Y U HAND ENCODIN UR JSON
[18:43:10] <ajpiano> use php json_encode
[18:43:10] <jamesdean77> mind you I only been coeing in javascript for a few months
[18:43:39] <jamesdean77> ^ jason encode would break jQuery.parse No ?
[18:43:44] <ajpiano> no
[18:43:57] <jamesdean77> Anyway I dont have jquery in the embeded hardware
[18:44:11] <ajpiano> handwriting your json will break jQuery.parseJSON, using solid language builtins for encoding JSON will not
[18:44:16] <ajpiano> what does that even remotely mean
[18:44:21] <ajpiano> there's a php function for encoding json
[18:44:49] <snover> oh man
[18:44:51] <snover> ajpiano
[18:45:00] <ajpiano> wasspu
[18:45:01] <snover> I shouldnâ€™t have clicked thatâ€¦
[18:45:13] <ajpiano> yea probz not man
[18:45:20] <ajpiano> it's friday you deserve better mon ami
[18:45:30] <snover> youâ€™ve been drinking so itâ€™s more OK for you to see it
[18:45:36] <jamesdean77> I wish I code use json encode
[18:45:36] <ajpiano> amen to that
[18:45:42] <ajpiano> why can't you jamesdean77
[18:45:43] <ajpiano> either way
[18:45:52] <ajpiano> you def shouldn't put newlines in your json
[18:46:14] <jamesdean77> @ajplano the device that Im working with does not have joson encode
[18:46:29] <snover> jamesdean77: wat
[18:46:34] <ngharo> it has php, but doesnt have json_encode?
[18:46:36] <ngharo> WAT
[18:47:38] <jamesdean77> Yes its a firewall allpience they removed it
[18:48:35] <ajpiano> jamesdean77: that doesn't mean you have to put newlines into the json you're writing
[18:48:57] <snover> notwithstanding the issue of how a â€œfirewallâ€ can remove core php functions
[18:49:21] <ajpiano> or how unicorns literally are the ones who bring leprechauns the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
[18:49:39] <jamesdean77> ^ ahhh Im lost here, lols
[18:50:20] <ajpiano> jamesdean77:
[18:50:35] <ajpiano> you should know that it actually isn't faster to offload the processing to the client in this case really
[18:50:47] <ajpiano> outputting a few more strings on the server barely takes any time
[18:50:59] <jamesdean77> ^ ajpiano it is with vary larg datasets
[18:50:59] <ajpiano> whereas processing lots of data on the client side does
[18:51:13] <ajpiano> that just makes it even more likely to crap out on the clientside :(
[18:51:15] <jamesdean77> I timed it counting with my hands
[18:51:23] <jamesdean77> lols
[18:51:31] <ajpiano> that only goes to 11`
[18:51:36] <ajpiano> if you're like me at least
[18:51:52] <ajpiano> jamesdean77: the bottom line is like
[18:51:52] <jamesdean77> But alas firebug NET is for suckers
[18:51:59] <ajpiano> don't put \n
[18:52:02] <ajpiano> into what you're echoing
[18:52:10] <ajpiano> cause... why are you doing that in the first place
[18:52:21] <coldhead> lol 11
[18:52:24] <coldhead> so many levels
[18:54:02] <jamesdean77> Thankls for helping fellas
[18:55:54] <ngharo> jamesdean77: please try this: http://pastebin.com/Gv9dg1ai
[18:56:44] <jamesdean77> ^ dude you think Im a code bum, Ant using your code
[18:56:49] <jamesdean77> lols jk
[18:57:08] <ngharo> i agree with ajpiano though
[18:57:21] <ngharo> i bet "offloading" this to the client will be even slower
[18:57:48] <snover> I donâ€™t see any antipatterns in this code at all, oh no
[18:58:20] <jamesdean77> @ngharo what did you change
[18:58:23] <ngharo> use pagination and only show x rows at a time, rather than blasting 10000 rows at the user
[18:58:34] <gnarf> cursors ftw!
[18:58:36] <snover> ugh, the previous paste already expired?!
[18:58:47] <ngharo> jamesdean77: is it not obvious?
[18:58:48] <ajpiano> would you also agree that wondering why jQuery.parseJSON doesn't parse newlines when you're putting newlines in your JSON is like putting a tutue on an elephant and wondering why it fails to star in swan lake?
[18:59:23] <snover> ajpiano: I must insist that you stick to food analogies at this point
[19:00:20] <snover> but if you want, we can use elephant poop as a food
[19:00:20] <ajpiano> would you also agree that wondering why jQuery.parseJSON doesn't parse newlines when you're putting newlines in your JSON is like putting roadkill on your bagel and then wondering why there is roadkill on your bagel?
[19:01:02] <`teh1> anyone know of any grid-style carousel plugins?
[19:01:09] <`teh1> i.e. 3x2 or something
[19:01:21] <`teh1> each page has a grid and infinite pages
[19:01:22] <snover> I was thinking itâ€™s more like putting poop on your bagel and then wondering why people vomit on your shoes when they try to eat your bagels
[19:01:23] <jamesdean77> @helper theres lot of food references in you comments, just saying
[19:01:28] <jamesdean77> :)
[19:01:39] <snover> I DONâ€™T GET IT WHY DONâ€™T YOU WANT TO EAT POOP?
[19:01:46] <jamesdean77> lols
[19:01:51] <`teh1> snover:  poopie is yum yum
[19:02:21] <ngharo> snover: my irc client hates your apostrophies!
[19:02:24] <ajpiano> jamesdean77: at this point i hope it is abundantly clear that you should not echo the \n into your json
[19:02:45] <snover> ngharo: Iâ€™m sorry that your IRC client is Unicode-deficient :)

[19:03:02] <ngharo> there goes my term
[19:04:06] <snover> Finally, â€œI could have used a php loop to build the table but off loading to client is fasterâ€ makes no sense because YOU ARE STRING BUILDING FROM THE SAME DATA NO MATTER WHAT
[19:04:16] <snover> oh well, facts are boring
[19:04:17] <snover> letâ€™s go to the mall
[19:04:23] <snover> gnarf: do you want to go to the mall with me?
[19:04:27] <woopwoop> hi, I need help figuing out what's the best way to do something like this? I wanna check an array for duplicates, and if there are, count them. eg var somearray = ['2', '2', '1', '2']; the function would find 2 as a duplicate, with a count of 3
[19:04:29] <ajpiano> can we go to the limited too
[19:04:41] <gnarf> snover: sure, i need to get some new skirts
[19:05:22] <jamesdean77> @ajpiano here you with the echo
[19:06:06] <snover> woopwoop: for (var i = 0, j = arr.length, hash = {}; i < j; ++i) { if (hash[arr[i]]) hash[arr[i]]++ else hash[arr[i]] = 1; } nb. only works for data that can be converted to string
[19:06:46] <gnarf> ?js var somearray = ['2', '2', '1', '2'], out = {}; $.each(somearray, function() { out[this] = (out[this] || 0 )+1; }); out @woopwoop
[19:06:47] <bot-t> woopwoop: {"2": 3, "1": 1}
[19:07:08] <woopwoop> thanks
[19:08:04] <userbound> Hey is there anyway to detect a link being clicked within an iFrame from the page the iframe is on w/ jquery
[19:08:31] <gnarf> snover: just to make sure, is this like, a date?
[19:08:33] <gnarf> :)
[19:09:23] <snover> whoa no way, what do you think a mall is, an airport?
[19:09:39] <jamesdean77> @snover you mad bro, heres a link to cheer you up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0
[19:09:45] * gnarf hides in the corner
[19:10:07] <Whirl3d> can someone suggest a plugin (other than BBQ) that allows me to modify browser history without changing the loaded page?
[19:10:16] <jamesdean77> No need to type in caps, makes me nerves like walking alone
[19:10:22] <gnarf> Whirl3d: BBQ
[19:10:25] <gnarf> :)
[19:10:37] <snover> gnarf: I forgot the secret floor tapping signal, but as soon as I remember, I will ask you out!
[19:10:57] <gnarf> floor tapping signal?
[19:11:10] <Whirl3d> BBQ's custom implementation of hash values for simulated urls doesn't work for me. I was hoping someone knew of another option
[19:11:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d: just use the hashchange and parse it yerself?
[19:11:35] <snover> custom whowhahohwa?
[19:11:55] <Wulf> Hello
[19:12:00] <gnarf> is that like a whosawhatsit?
[19:12:44] <Whirl3d> gnarf, thx for the input. I'll try it out and probably end up using bbq regardless... just thought I'd ask.
[19:13:07] <Wulf> I'm a bit lost. I have <div></div> and I'm inserting a text into it: $(this).append('text'); Now how would I change the text color to red? I tried $(this).contents().css('color','red'); but nothing happens
[19:13:28] <gnarf> Wulf: $(this).css('color','red')?
[19:13:42] <Wulf> gnarf: but this is the div, not the text node
[19:13:54] <gnarf> Wulf: so? you apply styles to divs, not text nodes...
[19:13:55] <snover> text nodes donâ€™t have styles.
[19:14:06] <Wulf> snover: oh.
[19:14:14] <gnarf> snover: with the assit!!!! POW!
[19:14:34] <Wulf> yay, it's all red! thanks
[19:14:50] <jamesdean77> Tryied you code, I dont have json encode
[19:15:02] <innociv> Is there a placeholder plugin for inputs that'll add the placeholder like a live()?
[19:15:07] <snover> jamesdean77: stop using an ancient version of php then
[19:15:24] <jamesdean77> ^ embeded device
[19:15:24] <snover> LIMIT BREAK
[19:16:05] <gnarf> innociv: no, but its not hard to implement something.....
[19:16:23] <innociv> I don't want to call the function every time I add an input..
[19:16:39] <gnarf> innociv: then give up
[19:16:53] <gnarf> I have a pattern
[19:17:40] <gnarf> $.fn.newContent = function() { return this.find("input[placeholder]").each(makePlaceholder); };
[19:17:51] <gnarf> $(function() { $(document).newContent(); });
[19:18:06] <gnarf> but it gets a little funky
[19:18:30] <Wulf> $(this).contents().replaceWith("x"); `this' is my <div>; It appears to work, but is it the right way to replace my text with another text?
[19:18:33] <gnarf> just cuz you can't $("<input placeholder=''>").newContent().appendTo("body");
[19:18:40] <gnarf> because "find" instead of "is"
[19:19:42] <gnarf> hrm, i just had a random idea...
[19:27:58] <Engin> .stop() does not stop an ongoing .effect()  ?
[19:42:17] <gnarf> random pattern/idea: http://jsfiddle.net/NJV5d/
[19:43:39] <Wulf> can I set an arbitrary attr on a node to attach some (invisible) information to a node and expect to be able to retrieve the value later? Or may I get into trouble with attr names which aren't defined for the node type?
[19:45:23] <ngharo> ?data @ Wulf
[19:45:23] <bot-t> Wulf, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:46:09] <gnarf> innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/NJV5d/1/ -- thats kinda the idea I just had in response to your question...
[19:46:17] <Wulf> ngharo: thank you!
[19:46:50] <gnarf> innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/NJV5d/2/ without console.log()s
[20:04:45] <innociv> Neat
[20:05:21] <innociv> How efficient would it be?  Is it just something that gets called when an element is appended?
[20:15:53] <gnarf> innociv: sry, got disconnected
[20:15:55] <gnarf> innociv: yeah - you just call it on new content anytime you add "newContent()"
[20:17:18] <chrismlyle> anyone know how how accomplish a fixed position div on the y-axis only while still scrollable horizontally?
[20:17:21] <innociv> Oh.  You call it before appending.  Or you could modify  jquery's append to do that automatically.
[20:19:01] <gnarf> innociv: you can call it after appending too
[20:19:10] <gnarf> innociv: just call it on new elements when you create em
[20:19:11] <gnarf> from html
[20:20:35] <innociv> But if you add it to append itself, you don't even have to think about it :p
[20:20:49] <gnarf> innociv: you want to think about it
[20:20:51] <gnarf> it takes time
[20:20:56] <innociv> Oh
[20:21:03] <gnarf> you don't neccearily need to bind every time you append either
[20:21:10] <gnarf> you can append elements already in dom to move them for instance
[20:21:17] <innociv> True
[20:21:31] <gnarf> this way, when you MAKE NEW CONTENT - you call .newContent() :)
[20:21:37] <innociv> But you could have had a check if it's a new element or not.
[20:21:57] <innociv> There is livequery, but I hear that's slow.
[20:21:59] <gnarf> innociv: which is a little more time.... ;)
[20:22:23] <gnarf> innociv: is it really that hard to call .newContent() when you inject new data? :)
[20:22:42] <innociv> Time for you to write?  Yeah, though it's something a lot of people would like.
[20:22:53] <innociv> Well, it's not hard, just can be forgetful with thousands of lines of code.
[20:26:57] <gnarf> innociv: i'm just sayin -- trying to hack it into append/etc is just a nightmare waiting to happen...
[20:27:21] <gnarf> better to be discreet
[20:27:39] <innociv> http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/ :3
[20:28:04] <gnarf> innociv: nightmare waiting to happen.....
[20:30:03] <corning> hey everyone, I'm having trouble calling an image path in this js file I'm working with
[20:30:59] <gnarf> ?p @corning
[20:30:59] <bot-t> corning, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:33:11] <corning> http://fixee.org/paste/kagjhrc/
[20:33:18] <corning> ok so line 81 is where I'm having trouble
[20:33:52] <corning> obviously the way its set now will look for just root URL, so yourdomain.com/images
[20:34:07] <gnarf> corning: actually, it seems it will use document relative url
[20:34:20] <corning> thats what I would want
[20:34:26] <corning> i want to just have the images in the same folder
[20:34:28] <gnarf> so if youre on yourdomain.com/somepage/hah.html - it will use /somepage/images/
[20:35:11] <corning> well here's my issue, this is for a WordPress theme, so I need it to call from a very specific folder
[20:35:33] <gnarf>  /rootFolder/images/whatever/ ?
[20:36:20] <corning> there's a problem though if the user is running the theme in another folder on the domain, for example setting the path to /wp-content/themes/themename/images works great if the person is using the theme on yourdomain.com
[20:36:31] <corning> however if they're installing it on yourdomain.com/wordpress
[20:36:58] <corning> it doesn't work and tries to find the image in yourdomain.com/wp-content/... instead of yourdomain.com/wordpress/wp-content/...
[20:37:57] <corning> in all my php files i use the wordpress function get_template_directory_uri() to call the template directory url which works perfectly, but this is a js file
[20:38:34] <corning> so yeah I'm kind of stumped at how to do this, im a total JS noob so this stuff is out of my realm of experience
[20:42:24] <corning> is there any way to tell it to call from the same directory that the file is located?
[20:43:04] <littulb> wow.... does ANYONE know how to reference (what is the selector for) a cloned object???
[21:15:20] <ngharo> var clone = $('#foo').clone();
[21:23:52] <amirite> can anyone suggest a solution for embedding vector graphics i.e. svg
[21:31:39] <Tallisman> Euhm, noob question, if I have an array, and want to remove a random element and not get the result NaN instead of the original value, how would I do that?
[21:35:44] <Tallisman> Back to googling :).
[21:38:17] <Tallisman> random behaviour.. splice isn't even supposed to leave NaN :\
[21:38:25] <amirite> shh
[21:38:28] <amirite> no talking allowed
[21:38:49] <Tallisman> oh, silenced*, (why*)?
[21:38:58] <amirite> don't use negative constructs in your sentence
[21:39:08] <amirite> " and not get the result NaN"
[21:39:13] <amirite> instead say what it is you want
[21:40:31] <Tallisman> well, pretty much all I want, remove an array item and have the array returned without that value :), and ofcourse the indexes shuffled.
[21:45:04] <Tallisman> bla = new Array(1, 2, 4, 8, 16); bla.splice(2, 1); result: bla = 1, 2, NaN, 8, 16
[21:45:34] <Tallisman> That is basically the problem i'm trying to solve :)
[21:46:33] <amirite> you need to create a new array
[21:46:46] <snover> ?mdc array splice @ Tallisman
[21:46:46] <bot-t> Tallisman, splice - MDC Docs - Changes the content of an array, adding new elements while removing old elements. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[21:47:53] <snover> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.splice(2,1); alert(arr);
[21:47:54] <bot-t> snover: [1, 2, 4, 5]
[21:48:08] <snover> works like a champ
[21:49:34] <Tallisman> (i know it should work like that :p, I don't even get why the result is NaN actually, splice is supposed not to do that)
[21:49:47] <snover> I just showed you that it does not do that
[21:49:53] <snover> whatever you are doing is not correct if it is
[21:50:36] <Tallisman> yea :p
[21:53:37] <Tallisman> I see.. I (slow motion captured lol) found the problem.. splice deletes the element but leaves a blank spot at the end of the array, then other elements get added to that element resulting in a blank index :)
[21:56:36] <snover> eh?
[21:56:55] <snover> ?eval var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; arr.splice(2,1); arr.push(6); alert(arr);
[21:56:56] <bot-t> snover: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
[21:57:22] <snover> Tallisman: again, splice doesnâ€™t work that wayâ€¦
[21:57:41] <Tallisman> and ofcourse the problem to that was the fact that I am to incapable to use push :p
[21:57:48] <Tallisman> >.<
[22:17:27] <abjorn> You may call me...Lord Abjorn.

[23:03:49] <coldhead> good job, dxgriffiths
[23:04:51] <dytrivedi> it's no time to code

[23:06:21] <mykul> i've ben recursing since i started writing code
[23:06:37] <mykul> damn it, there was a joke in there somewhere
[23:06:44] <mykul> rushed the delivery
[23:08:00] <coldhead> everyone clear your screens and let mykul try again
[23:08:10] <mykul> forget it
[23:08:25] <mykul> freenode is large
[23:08:30] <mykul> i'll find another audience
[23:09:10] <dytrivedi> go to dalnet
[23:10:19] <coldhead> NO U
[23:10:25] <dxgriffiths> coldhead: why thank you.
[23:10:38] <coldhead> just 1 hour 50 minutes until my rapture
[23:10:52] <coldhead> and i guess that means new zealand is 10 minutes into the rapture already
[23:12:00] <shaggy_> lag
[23:12:01] <snover> they are so lucky
[23:12:08] <mykul> fucking lag is the worst
[23:12:40] <shaggy_> It's a rapture, No one will remember the lag anyway
[23:13:59] <mykul> http://www.dangerousminds.net/images/uploads/advertising_files/Rapture_prank_clothes.jpg
[23:15:20] <abjorn> coldhead: nah, it's supposed to happen at I think 9 PM UTC
[23:15:46] <coldhead> no sah, it's 6pm
[23:15:46] <dytrivedi> ?wa time until 9 PM UTC
[23:15:47] <bot-t> dytrivedi, WolframAlpha - Currently Disabled
[23:15:53] <dytrivedi> wa time until 9 PM UTC
[23:15:54] <coldhead> 6pm local time
[23:15:56] <coldhead> wherever you are
[23:16:10] <abjorn> according to?
[23:16:22] <coldhead> THE BIBLE
[23:16:24] <coldhead> apparently
[23:16:32] <abjorn> lol
[23:16:35] <coldhead> and the official rapture wbsite
[23:16:38] <abjorn> rofl
[23:16:39] <snover> Iâ€™m really really disappointed
[23:16:44] <abjorn> "official rapture website"
[23:16:45] <snover> I was looking forward to it
[23:16:59] <coldhead> have you heard from any new zealanders?
[23:17:02] <snover> yes :(
[23:17:04] <coldhead> they might already be taken up
[23:17:08] <coldhead> oh no :(
[23:17:23] <coldhead> well maybe there are no righteous in nz
[23:17:38] <snover> thereâ€™d still be the, er, what was it this time? earthquakes?
[23:18:30] <coldhead> i guess the earhtquakes will politely wait for 6pm in their timezones to start
[23:18:41] <coldhead> god checking his wristwatch
[23:18:46] <coldhead> i love it
[23:19:24] <dytrivedi> Last minute reading - "11. "The Kama Sutra" by Vatsyayana. If the rapture happens without you, why not enjoy yourself? The ancient Hindu guide for lovemaking includes practical advice for sexual intercourse, including a number of illustrations."
[23:19:54] <dytrivedi> so it's like 6 hours from now here
[23:20:00] <abjorn> SQUEEZE MY LEMON TILL THE JUICE RUNS DOWN MY LEG
[23:20:02] <abjorn> sup
[23:20:06] <dytrivedi> I think my torrent will be finished downloading
[23:20:13] <abjorn> in time for the rapture!
[23:22:02] <abjorn> Well I guess at least I'll have watched the new Pirates movie by the time the rapture comes? So...that's something.
[23:22:26] <abjorn> But I think I haven't wiggled enough.
[23:22:38] * abjorn wiggles
[23:23:05] <dytrivedi> haha
[23:30:17] <dr0id> each part of the world ends on its own timezone
[23:30:44] <coldhead> convenient isn't it!
[23:30:56] <systemfault> Because Jesus cares about timezones.
[23:31:03] <systemfault> Amen.
[23:31:04] <coldhead> and to think that the world's timezones are in the bible

[23:40:57] <snover> gnarf: I am pretty sure that will end up being a bad thing in the long run
[23:40:59] <abjorn> howdidyouknow
[23:41:11] <gnarf> snover: i kinda agree, but #jqueryui-dev is lonely
[23:41:15] <dr0id> abjorn: and your surname is Frang ?

[23:42:03] <dr0id> http://i.imgur.com/bTFEQ.jpg
[23:42:05] <snover> gnarf: also, I have to say, Iâ€™m feeling rather :| that the jQuery â€œteamâ€ page has been replaced with a list of voting members only
[23:42:16] <abjorn> that dog is rapture-ready
[23:42:20] <gnarf> snover: :/
[23:42:23] <coldhead> abjorn do you did you incur some kind of brain injury during childbirth? #justsaying
[23:42:35] <gnarf> snover: at least UI still has the team page ;)
[23:43:10] <abjorn> well, no, coldhead, although my dad did hit my head on a ceiling fan blade (while the fan was on) when I was baby
[23:43:25] <abjorn> but that's totally unrelated
[23:43:47] <snover> totally unrelated
[23:43:56] <abjorn> not even relevant at all
[23:43:57] * abjorn wiggles
[23:44:28] <bl1nk7> hi all
[23:44:41] <coldhead> lol
[23:44:46] <coldhead> thanks for clearing that up abjorn
[23:44:50] <coldhead> wiggle on
[23:44:55] <abjorn> I don't think I cleared anything up!
[23:45:06] <abjorn> the sad part is my dad really did do that
[23:45:08] <coldhead> well i have no further questions
[23:45:18] <coldhead> least you got a dad!
[23:45:32] <abjorn> Well, considering your existence, I would assume you do too
[23:45:47] <snover> coldhead is jesus
[23:45:49] <bl1nk7> i'm trying to create a jQuery slider, I have a div with a overflow:hidden; and with very large content inside; i'm trying to create buttons to slide from left to right and from right to left, using margin-right + var + 'px' is okay for scrolling from right to left, but from left to right?
[23:45:51] <abjorn> o ok
[23:45:55] <dytrivedi> haha
[23:45:57] <abjorn> I can see that
[23:46:06] <snover> the rapture isnâ€™t happening because heâ€™s lazy and unemployed
[23:46:11] <abjorn> rofl
[23:46:15] <coldhead> feels good man
[23:46:21] <dytrivedi> http://theoatmeal.com/comics/rapture
[23:47:00] <gnarf> ?scrollLeft @bl1nk7
[23:47:00] <bot-t> bl1nk7, .scrollLeft(): Get the current horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[23:47:52] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure the UI slider demos has a scrollbar demo
[23:47:55] <gnarf> ?slider
[23:47:56] <bot-t> gnarf, UI/API/1.8/Slider - The jQuery UI Slider plugin makes selected elements into sliders. There are various options such as multiple handles, and ranges. The handle can be moved with the mouse or the arrow keys. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider

[23:49:38] <gnarf> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll @bl1nk7
[23:50:03] <bl1nk7> gnarf, thanks a lot
[23:50:11] <gnarf> bl1nk7: seems they use margins
[23:50:16] <bl1nk7> yeah
[23:50:20] <bl1nk7> hmm
[23:51:17] <bl1nk7> it's not going to work with just margins
[23:51:26] <bl1nk7> because it should be capable of scrolling from two sides
[23:51:30] <bl1nk7> kind of rotating it
[23:55:11] <abjorn> lol "@HappyMarriedMe:Â Considering the loan I just took out, the world better be ending."
[23:57:12] <dr0id> and I need to pay my water bills @ http://i.imgur.com/GHuUI.jpg
[23:58:28] <abjorn> lol what.
[23:59:04] <Wulf> function Foo() { this.keyDown = function(ev) {}  this.func = function() { $(document).keydown(function(ev){this.keyDown(ev);}); } }   That doesn't work, because the `this' in the handler function is probably not the `this' I mean. What would be the typical "fix"?
[23:59:18] <dr0id> can I haz help ?
