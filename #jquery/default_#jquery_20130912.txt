[00:00:22] <Anes> Cork: i installed it GNU stuff
[00:00:37] <Anes> Cork: Where i got that stuff
[00:00:39] <sdwrage> Cork, it works though so why mess with what isn't broken?
[00:00:55] <sdwrage> is there a big diff?
[00:00:58] <sdwrage> just curious
[00:01:07] <Cork> sdwrage: winner will be a pure dom element
[00:01:20] <Cork> sdwrage: that that is why you need to wrap it
[00:01:21] <sdwrage> yeah thats fine. I needed to pull items out from it anyways :)
[00:01:38] <sdwrage> Cork, https://github.com/sdwrage/randomactsofrandom
[00:01:44] <sdwrage> if you know how to use node.js
[00:02:01] <doug65536> sdwrage: line 20 is a no-op
[00:02:21] <sdwrage> doug65536, explain what you mean
[00:02:24] <Cork> sdwrage: cause you arn't wrapping it you will have to rewrap it every time you access it
[00:02:26] <sdwrage> oh hah
[00:02:37] <sdwrage> yeah I planned on adding something there
[00:03:00] <Cork> sdwrage: if you do .eq() you won't to recreate the jquery object every time you want to use it
[00:03:07] <Cork> *need to
[00:03:16] <sdwrage> Cork, but would it matter if it isn't browser based?
[00:03:42] <Cork> sdwrage: you will create more memory garbage so you might trigger gc much earlier
[00:03:45] <Cork> so yes it matters
[00:03:46] <doug65536> sdwrage: if you use .eq then it will wrap it for you
[00:03:49] <sdwrage> okay
[00:03:50] <sdwrage> ;)
[00:03:52] <sdwrage> ill try it
[00:03:56] <sdwrage> thanks
[00:04:06] <sdwrage> if you want to fork the project, you are more than welcome to
[00:04:10] <sdwrage> ill make the fix
[00:06:49] <sdwrage> Cork, gave credit to you in my last commit
[00:06:51] <sdwrage> :)
[00:07:00] <Cork> heh, not needed
[00:07:09] <sdwrage> meh, I wanted to
[00:09:19] <doug65536> sdwrage: you don't need to wrap 'winner' on line 19. winner.find('.author').text() will work now
[00:17:25] <sdwrage> doug65536, okay, will test that
[00:19:01] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented various jquery countdowns in my web, but these not works. If I implement only one, works, but with multiple no. Anyone can help me?
[00:20:23] <chovy> is there anyway to get effective height of a div? even if the css has max-height rule applied?
[00:20:32] <chovy> i mean 'real height'
[00:21:12] <Cork> chovy: does the element have overflow set?
[00:21:38] <Cork> or rather is the scroll area of the element the full height?
[00:24:30] <chovy> Cork: yeah
[00:24:39] <chovy> it has max-height and overflow-y: auto
[00:24:50] <chovy> i jsut want to know if the div is invoking the overflow.
[00:24:55] <Cork> chovy: $(elm).prop('scrollHeight')
[00:25:16] <chovy> what will that give me?
[00:25:30] <Cork> the height of the scroll area in the element
[00:26:42] <chovy> ok, so it tells me 61
[00:27:09] <chovy> what can i do with that?
[00:27:23] <chovy> i don't have a visible scrollbar, so not sure why its 61
[00:27:27] <chovy> i would have expected 0.
[00:28:10] <Cork> height() + scrollHeight should be the total height
[00:29:05] <chovy> why would scrollHeight be greater than 0 if i have no visible scrollbar?
[00:29:45] <sdwrage> doug65536, https://github.com/sdwrage/randomactsofrandom/blob/master/index.js
[00:29:53] <Cork> chovy: if the element has overflow
[00:30:03] <Cork> scrollbar or no scrollbar doesn't matter
[00:31:29] <Cork> chovy: opps sorry no scrollHeight is the full height
[00:31:34] <Cork> not just the overflow height
[00:31:49] <chovy> ok, that makes sense.
[00:31:58] <chovy> I can just assume that is the real height of the el?
[00:32:41] <Cork> chovy: yes
[00:32:54] <Cork> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/EqptG/
[00:32:55] <chovy> does not take into account padding/margin/border does it?
[00:33:11] <Cork> it includes padding
[00:33:16] <Cork> but not border and margin
[00:33:29] <Cork> (as padding is included in the scroll area)
[00:33:42] <chovy> ok
[00:33:51] <chovy> this is great. thanks
[00:34:08] <Cork> np
[00:51:25] <Qantourisc> Whoever maintain the website: OPERA is not a mobile browser, they DO have a desktop version ... cheeze, it's "You must have IE6.0 all over..."
[00:52:02] <Cork> Qantourisc: honestly, who cares, opera throw in the towel anyway
[00:52:44] <Qantourisc> Cork: and i'm also about to give up with using opera (still have to decide which one i'm going to move to and transfer bookmarks)
[00:52:50] <Qantourisc> Cork: but that's a bad excuse :(
[00:53:28] <Cork> Qantourisc: what i meant is opera only develops theming for chromium now days
[00:54:08] <Qantourisc> Cork: I know, but then it will most likely still identify as Opera, resulting in the same issue :p
[00:54:25] <Cork> Qantourisc: most likely not
[00:54:39] <Cork> ua's is normally about the engine not the interface
[00:54:41] <Qantourisc> (depends on detection code)
[00:54:45] <Cork> ya
[00:55:27] <Cork> suspect they will do the nice mozilla 5.0 <blupp> Opera like Gecko like Safari like Chrome thing
[00:55:37] <Cork> i just LOVE ua:s now days :)
[00:55:59] * Qantourisc doesn't know "ua" ...
[00:56:09] <Cork> ua == User Agent
[00:56:17] <Cork> the string the browser sends in the request header
[00:56:17] <Qantourisc> A
[00:56:21] <Cork> what servers normally sniff
[00:56:24] <Qantourisc> Well that I know :)
[00:56:31] <Qantourisc> was the short of it i didn't knew
[01:03:50] <chovy> Qantourisc: i use xmarks for bookmarks. then you can use all of them.
[01:04:01] <chovy> chrome/ff/saf
[01:04:26] <Qantourisc> Ow god, no thank you cloud
[01:04:48] <Qantourisc> I'd prefer a html page then or a dir with .url files(if I was on Windows)
[01:05:06] <chovy> Qantourisc: i think you can run it on your own server if i'm not mistaken.
[01:05:18] <Qantourisc> Feels like overkill :)
[01:05:25] <Qantourisc> Maybe I should write a simple webapp :)
[01:07:31] <Sergey> Hello. Can anyone suggest nice articles/tutorials on how to handle big jquery projects?
[01:08:05] <chovy> i find it indespensible
[01:08:10] <chovy> that and lastpass
[01:08:33] <chovy> Sergey: define "big"?
[01:10:25] <pepijndevos> how can I construct a request with ?key=1&key=2&key=3
[01:10:28] <Sergey> chovy: about 10-15 pages, all consists of different forms (input fields, custom tables, tree controls, chats).
[01:10:51] <chovy> Sergey: single page app, or server side pages
[01:10:56] <Cork> peper: ?.params()
[01:11:09] <Cork> ?api jquery.params
[01:11:09] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:11:12] <Cork> ?api jquery.param
[01:11:14] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.param(): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[01:12:23] <Sergey> Server side pages (Django)
[01:13:00] <pepijndevos> ok, let me try that....
[01:13:30] <chovy> Sergey: i usually just organize my re-usable code into mini libraries and then include the ones i need on the page.
[01:13:42] <Sergey> Probably i need some MVC approach, but from the first impression seems like backbone.js and similar frameworks are not straightforward
[01:14:14] <chovy> Sergey: if you have an API only, then go with SPA framework.
[01:14:15] <chovy> https://github.com/chovy/bmr/tree/master/app/js
[01:14:25] <chovy> checkout ui.js
[01:15:00] <chovy> then in my page.js i can just call ui.whatever()
[01:15:17] <chovy> like in inbox.js
[01:19:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hello, what does this do? $("p").css({ "height" : "hide"  });
[01:20:58] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: it would reset height as "hide" isn't a valid value for it
[01:21:15] <Sergey> chovy: Thanks! And what is "_.extend(app, {" really does? You are using this technique in the app everywhere.
[01:21:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> not valid for css, but valid for animate?
[01:21:37] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: for either
[01:22:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> are you sure? I have a jquery book that uses this a lot
[01:22:06] <Sergey> Can you share some links about this mothodology? (Except the jQuery website ) )
[01:22:36] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: well if the css sets p { height: 0; }
[01:22:43] <Cork> then "hide" would do just that :)
[01:23:37] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: animate does have a few funky strings, but as far as i know hide on height isn't one of them
[01:24:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> they also use "height" : "toggle"
[01:24:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> very confusing
[01:24:40] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: hmm just checked again
[01:24:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:24:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> here they use it too
[01:24:52] <Cork> and eys animate actually takes show/hide/toggle on it O_o
[01:24:54] <Cork> ya
[01:25:01] <Cork> *yes
[01:25:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so what does it do then? hide is same as 0?
[01:27:21] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animation-properties
[01:27:31] <Cork> read the "In additional" section
[01:27:49] <Cork> uh "in addition"
[01:28:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I read that, I don't get it
[01:28:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hiding a height, that doesn't make any sense
[01:28:42] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: it means it will mainly do the same thing as .show() .hide()
[01:29:01] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: ya, i agree it doesn't make much sense
[01:29:29] <Cork> but it would depend on what field it is run on, and flip it to the state the is hiding
[01:29:36] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: and for height it would be 0
[01:29:57] <Cork> not sure what it would be on margin or border though...
[01:29:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so what would height toggle do then?
[01:30:17] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: starting value and 0?
[01:30:19] <Cork> not sure
[01:30:30] <Cork> i would never use those things
[01:30:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> me neither, but I can't follow the book i'm reading because of this :(
[01:30:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> they use it so often
[01:31:02] <Cork> lovely
[01:31:09] <Cork> time to find another book? :D
[01:31:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> heheh maybe

[02:06:02] <BillTheButcher_l> hey folks. Trying to figure out how to determine a winner in jQuery following a guide. Created a post on stackoverlfow. Would appriciate if you could check it out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18759632/tic-tac-toe-qjuery-algorithm and maybe help
[02:22:39] <xqo> hi, how can I store variables until after a page-refresh?
[02:22:59] <Cork> xqo: you can't
[02:23:12] <Cork> you can store a string through a few different means though
[02:23:24] <xqo> without making it visible to the user?
[02:23:32] <xqo> i dont wanna put it in the address-bar
[02:24:00] <Cork> like: 1. sending it over the server; 2. using the hash, 3. using indexDB, 4. using sessionStorage, 5. using cookie
[02:24:21] <Cork> xqo: you can't ever prevent the user from being able to find it
[02:24:35] <xqo> thats ok, i meant i dont want it in the address-bar
[02:24:38] <xqo> what does #1 mean?
[02:25:02] <Cork> that is basically that the server holds the data
[02:25:10] <Cork> and when the user requests the server it sends it
[02:25:16] <Cork> like though ajax, or in page
[02:25:27] <xqo> ok
[02:36:22] <xqo> is it possible to do delay a page-load and do an animation or whatever before it?
[02:37:06] <Cork> xqo: on domready set what you want to animate to hidden (.hide())
[02:37:11] <Cork> and then animate it to what you want
[02:38:04] <xqo> i dont think i understood how that works
[02:38:32] <Cork> domready triggers before anything is visible
[02:38:44] <Cork> so if you set things to hidden there they will start out hidden
[02:38:51] <Cork> and from there you do the animation you want
[02:39:06] <xqo> i think i phrased it badly
[02:39:11] <xqo> in my webshop i have buy-buttons which put products in the shopping-cart. the button is a <a><div></div></a>, which hrefs to a python-function. the python-function redirects to HTTP_REFERER when it returns.
[02:39:31] <xqo> i want to animate something right when the button is clicked, and i want that to delay leaving the page and going to the python-function
[02:39:46] <Cork> xqo: ah, that is harder
[02:39:50] <xqo> so you can see the animation before the page looks like it has refreshed
[02:40:01] <Cork> you could override the page load, and block the normal link
[02:40:06] <Cork> then do the animation
[02:40:33] <Cork> and finnaly when your done do window.location = '<original href>';
[02:41:02] <Cork> won't give exactly the same effect as clicking the link
[02:41:05] <Cork> but close enough
[02:41:23] <xqo> will onclick "override" the <a>, kinda?
[02:41:38] <Cork> uh don't use inline event attributes
[02:41:43] <Cork> use event listeners
[02:41:51] <xqo> bind("click", ...) etc then
[02:41:55] <Cork> yes
[02:42:15] <xqo> so if jquery works, this method works, but if scripts are disabled or whatever, the <a href> will still work?
[02:42:29] <Cork> that is the point of it yes
[02:42:33] <xqo> great, thanks
[02:54:27] <raj> can my browser tell when the url goes from www.mysite.com/somepage to www.mysite.com/somepage#test
[02:54:30] <raj> ?
[02:54:47] <raj> specifically, I'm using History.js
[02:55:12] <raj> window.onstatechange is not triggered by that change
[02:56:03] <Cork> ?mdn hashChange
[02:56:04] <b-ot> Cork: hashchange - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/hashchange
[02:56:05] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn hashChange" in jQuery Docs.
[02:56:27] <Cork> oooh, didn't know b-ot had mdn support :)
[02:57:47] <raj> oh, that's pretty good support
[02:58:08] <Cork> doesn't really matter ?g mdn does the same thing
[02:58:33] <raj> so window.hashchange = somefunc; window.onstatechange = somefunc ?
[02:58:58] <raj> Cork, i meant the hashchange event has good support :)
[02:59:09] <Cork> ah
[02:59:51] <Cork> raj: and no it's window.onhashchange or window.addEventListener('hashchange',
[02:59:55] <raj> thank you for the info, good sir :)
[03:00:06] <Cork> heh np
[03:00:08] <raj> oh
[03:00:10] <raj> ok
[03:37:45] <itatitat> ey guys, I have a problem, Im using dialog, in jquery, the problem is that in the dialog I open I have to bind some events, but this bind only work for the first time I open the dialog, if I close and open again, all the events doesn work
[03:37:57] <itatitat> someone might explain to me why?
[03:56:53] <MrBaz> itatitat, are you binding on page load ?
[04:05:58] <Christer> Any idea why it doesnt see 1 as a value of ["1"] in the method $.inArray() ?
[04:06:13] <Christer> i tried doing a toString() as well.
[04:08:58] <Christer> nvm :)
[04:11:34] <Tumulte> hey ! Is there a way to avoid reloading jquery in an iframe ? I've used window.parent.$, but it doesn't work
[04:13:19] <Tumulte> (doesn't work as in "I don't have errors anymore, but the player (using jquery) is not displayed")
[04:14:03] <Tumulte> it works when the library is loaded in situ
[04:15:59] <BillTheButcher_l> question: what does $("someTag")[0] refer to?
[04:17:22] <BillTheButcher_l> I have a row that is var cell = $("<td height=50 width=50 align=center valign=center></td>"); and then cell[0].indicator = someValue; I fail to understand what indicator is here
[04:18:41] <xqo> BillTheButcher $(".someClass")[0] refers to the first item found with class "someClass" i think
[04:19:20] <stigma> xqo: Wouldn't it be $(".someclass:eq(0)") ?
[04:19:49] <xqo> i dont know, im guessing its like slicing in python. so {1,2,3,4,5}[2] will yield 3
[04:19:50] <stigma> Oh sorry, didn't read the first question :)
[04:21:57] <xqo> Im trying to move one div to go ontop of another div, but instead the first div pops up onto the second, and starts moving from there.. whats wrong? http://hastebin.com/vesijiqofe.coffee
[04:23:52] <Cork> xqo: i would recommend setting a class and do the special css trick there
[04:24:10] <Cork> xqo: you don't have z-index set and that is most likely what causes the problem
[04:24:38] <xqo> you mean i should move it with css instead?
[04:25:04] <xqo> Cork you mean i should move it with css instead?*
[04:25:09] <Cork> xqo: have a class set absolute and the z-index there
[04:25:14] <jop008> I have this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-12_at_1.22.51_PM-IKwVwrEX.png as header bar I don't want the border around in every 1/3 of the total width. This is my fiddle where I miss login  http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/13/
[04:25:15] <Cork> and set the top and left in js
[04:25:39] <xqo> Cork how do i get and set the z-index?
[04:25:50] <Cork> xqo: if you CAN set the position from css definitely, but if it needs to be dynamic then do it in js
[04:26:00] <Cork> xqo: you don't need to get it
[04:26:09] <Cork> just set it to a "high enough" number
[04:26:17] <Cork> something like 500 should normally be way enough
[04:26:27] <Cork> possible something as low as 1 or 2 might work too
[04:26:45] <xqo> oh z-index is "on top of things" index? so div1 with z-index 2 gets hidden by div2 which has z-index 3?
[04:27:37] <Cork> xqo: if you have no z-index sat all content is z-index 0
[04:28:04] <Cork> xqo: the z-index accumulate cross the parents
[04:28:34] <Cork> so if you have z-index sat to say 5 on a parent and then set to 2 on a child
[04:28:49] <Cork> if a sibling to the parent want to cover it it needs to be higher then 8
[04:29:35] <Cork> (man it is soo nice that old broken ie z-index bugs are gone...)
[04:30:03] <xqo> alright so i made the class and gave it z-index 500 and positon:absolute
[04:30:17] <xqo> but it still starts animating from where i want it to end up
[04:30:36] <xqo> Cork http://hastebin.com/rodupuvani.avrasm
[04:30:49] <Cork> ah
[04:30:53] <Cork> i missed the animation call
[04:31:01] <Cork> xqo: you need to set the start position of the element
[04:31:08] <Cork> you can't animate from inline to absolute
[04:31:20] <slax0r> there wouldn't happen to be any idangero.us devs here, would there?
[04:31:36] <xqo> Cork ?
[04:32:06] <Cork> xqo: you will have to set the top, left in the css() call
[04:32:16] <Cork> xqo: else animate will not know what to animate from
[04:32:28] <Cork> cause top and left will be ""
[04:32:47] <xqo> Cork i dont understand, please could you edit my paste to illustrate?
[04:33:17] <Cork> xqo: you don't understand "set the start value"?
[04:33:55] <Cork> xqo: if you are to animate from undefined to 1625, where are you to start?
[04:34:51] <xqo> Cork http://hastebin.com/jikenakiwo.avrasm like so?
[04:35:07] <xqo> (lines 4 and 5)
[04:35:40] <Cork> xqo: sure if the start position is a static position you can define it in css
[04:35:57] <Cork> xqo: but i got the impression you didn't know the top/left cause it was in context
[04:36:10] <Cork> and that would mean you would have to get the elements top and left position
[04:36:15] <xqo> oh, yeah its not static
[04:37:01] <xqo> link.css("top",link.position().top); like so?
[04:37:31] <Cork> xqo: yes
[04:40:34] <xqo> Cork almost working, except instead of going up and right it goes up and left, hehe..
[04:40:43] <xqo> Cork http://hastebin.com/tapimahiwa.avrasm
[04:41:07] <Cork> xqo: so portlet_position.left is the wrong value
[04:41:36] <xqo> i tried * -1 to reverse, but that just shifted it slightly
[04:42:19] <xqo> i think i can google for a solution to this.. thanks!!
[04:43:10] <BillTheButcher_l> http://pastebin.com/GWKC3t2R could you take a look at this and explain the condition on line 7
[04:45:26] <xqo> BillTheButcher if (condition1 evaluates to true AND condition2 evaluates to True) {dostuff};
[04:45:27] <Cork> xqo: well check what the start value is and what the end value is
[04:45:52] <Cork> no
[04:45:56] <Cork> & is bitshift
[04:45:59] <xqo> derp.
[04:46:14] <Cork> js > print(3 & 1)
[04:46:23] <Cork> js> print(3 & 1)
[04:46:31] <Cork> <_<
[04:46:32] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[04:46:40] <Cork> good boy
[04:47:08] <Cork> or if you prefer binary 11 & 01 == 01
[04:47:32] <Cork> it's a common pattern to store multiple binary values in one value
[04:48:36] <BillTheButcher_l> cork could you explain?
[04:49:03] <BillTheButcher_l> First it compares two ints with bitwise operator? What does that mean and how is the comparison made?
[04:49:55] <Cork> BillTheButcher: 2 is binary 10 and 3 is binary 11
[04:50:11] <Cork> 3 & 2 == 2 cause 11 & 10 == 10
[04:50:32] <Cork> BillTheButcher: binary and or bitwise and is the term
[04:50:53] <Cork> and the bit that are sat on both side of the & is the only ones that are kept
[04:51:19] <Cork> 111011 & 011000 == 11000 (binary)
[04:51:47] <xqo> BillTheButcher_l if both conditions are true, the result is true, if not it is false
[04:51:58] <Cork> or might be more interesting 1010101 && 011000 == 010000
[04:52:07] <Cork> xqo: no
[04:52:17] <Cork> that is logical and
[04:52:21] <Cork> it's TOTALLY different
[04:52:36] <Cork> && is logical and & is bitwise and
[04:52:43] <xqo> okay
[04:52:55] * xqo will not speak again, lol...
[04:53:35] <Cork> BillTheButcher: from common code practise if(flags & 0x01) {}
[04:53:54] <Cork> that will check if the first bit is set and do a kind of true/false check based on that bit
[04:54:24] <Cork> 0x02 is the second bit 0x04 is after that and so on
[04:56:01] <BillTheButcher_l> Must say I dont understand. The example 111011 & 011000 == 11000. You mentioned that the bit that are sat on both side of the & is the only ones that are kept. Could you point out wich one it is and how does it result to 11000
[04:56:49] <Cork> 111011 & 011000 == 11000
[04:57:50] <Cork> or a tiny bit clearer (maybe) 111011 & 011000 == 011000
[04:59:05] <shoky> 111011 &
[04:59:07] <Cork> BillTheButcher: but this might be a better example 1010101 & 0011000 == 0010000
[04:59:08] <shoky> 011000 ==
[04:59:12] <shoky> 011000
[04:59:28] <MacDada> hi, my page reads ?url=http://xyz GET parameter and does $('<img src="' + url + '" />'); â€“ this obviously is bad, I can inject js from URL. How do I escape the url?
[05:00:12] <Cork> MacDada: $('<img/>').prop('href', url)
[05:00:36] <MacDada> Cork: thx
[05:00:47] <Cork> that isn't working with html so you can't parse random things with it
[05:02:53] <MacDada> Cork: why $.parseHTML() instead of $() doesn't  help?
[05:03:16] <Cork> MacDada: $.parseHTML is what $() uses
[05:03:24] <Cork> MacDada: the problem comes from actually parsing html
[05:03:43] <Cork> MacDada: $('<img/>') does the same thing as $(document.createElement('img'))
[05:03:47] <Cork> so no html parsing there
[05:04:04] <MacDada> ok, thx!
[05:16:56] <TelFiRE> Hey all, I like the way jQuery App Folders works (http://app-folders.com/) and I want to make something similar, but JAF requires you to put your rows in separate divs, which makes it difficult to make responsive (rows would be of 3 in one view, 4 in another, etc) any suggestions?
[05:21:18] <d0den> noob question - what parameters do I pass to .split to get it to split the string every 2 characters?
[05:22:01] <Cork> d0den: you can't use split for that
[05:22:18] <d0den> Cork, will I have to use a regex instead?
[05:23:41] <Cork> d0den: well split(/(..)/) might do it on second though
[05:24:11] <Cork> d0den: but ya i would prob go with something like a loop or similar instead
[05:24:39] <d0den> I'm reading a series of values from a query string. I can't decide if I should just always write '-' into the string as a separator and use split(), or go through the hassle of learning to do it in a more elegant way :P
[05:24:53] <d0den> thanks for that suggestion, I'll test it
[05:25:27] <Cork> d0den: what is it your trying to do?
[05:26:19] <d0den> on a page where the user can move 6 sliders to different positions, I want to generate a url with a query string that encodes the position of each slider so that they can share it and new visitors to that url get the same slider positions
[05:26:38] <d0den> I'm working on decoding first, I think generating the urls will be easier
[05:27:47] <Cork> d0den: why not just use a json array?
[05:28:06] <d0den> Cork, I don't know what that is or how to use it I'm afraid :|
[05:28:06] <Cork> [sl1,sl2,sl3,sl4,sl5] ?
[05:28:34] <Ricaz> not sure where to ask this question, but I'm having trouble with websockets.. Here is the code: http://pastie.org/8319740 and a scrot of the error: http://i.imgur.com/ciUOzyr.jpg?1
[05:29:03] <d0den> Cork, how would I encode that in a query string?
[05:29:03] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify([10,68,15,27])
[05:29:07] <bot-t> Cork: "[10,68,15,27]"
[05:29:50] <Cork> so just do window.location.search('s' + JSON.stringify([10,68,15,27]));
[05:29:52] <Cork> for example
[05:30:36] <Cork> d0den: opps sorry meant hash not search
[05:31:07] <d0den> Cork, I will look into that, thank you for the advice
[05:37:03] <amcsi_work> hi
[05:37:43] <amcsi_work> is it a good idea for 2 js files to communicate to each other by made-up events on HTML elements that are guaranteed to exist (such as the <body tag>)?
[05:38:19] <Cork> amcsi_work: generically no
[05:38:48] <Cork> amcsi_work: you should only use the fake event solution if you want to message unknown scripts
[05:38:59] <amcsi_work> how should they communicate then?
[05:39:07] <Cork> amcsi_work: if it is just for these two scripts to communicate internally, just use callback
[05:39:27] <Cork> amcsi_work: have one of the (the one loaded first) provide an api for the second to call
[05:39:39] <Cork> amcsi_work: alternatively you could use a global variable
[05:40:20] <amcsi_work> ok
[05:40:29] <Cork> amcsi_work: though just to make that clear; js don't have file/resource scope
[05:40:50] <Cork> so unless your scoping the code in the resources you can just use them in the second one
[06:01:20] <xqo> Cork i cant get the animation to go the right way :|
[06:01:39] <Cork> xqo: try make an example on jsfiddle
[06:01:58] <xqo> cork can i pm  live code?
[06:02:19] <Cork> xqo: i most likely won't have time digging through a full page to find what happens
[06:02:31] <xqo> ok...
[06:05:50] <d0den> can I use Number.toPrecision(x) on a hex value?
[06:06:34] <Cork> d0den: hex is a way to enter the number
[06:06:41] <Cork> it isn't a format
[06:07:10] <Cork> and as hex can't be a decimal, i don't really follow what precision would have to do with it
[06:07:41] <d0den> as in, return 0A rather than A
[06:07:54] <Cork> that isn't percision
[06:08:07] <Cork> and no if you want leading zeros
[06:08:15] <Cork> you will have to pad that your self
[06:08:25] <d0den> Cork, ok, thanks
[06:08:31] <Cork> d0den: to print hex, the simplest is to do toString(16)
[06:15:57] <alexfu> can someone point me to the source code for fadeIn & fadeOut methods? I can't seem to find it...
[06:17:50] <Cork> alexfu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L579
[06:25:16] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to implement a jquery script called countdown, but I it not works. I think I have everything right, but someone could help me?
[06:26:23] <Cork> what's with all these countdown script questions recently, is there a test somewhere or something?
[06:26:38] <Cork> abailarri: don't ask to ask, just ask
[06:27:51] <abailarri> Cork: I implemennted the script, but it not works, does not perform the action. I have the pastebin prepared
[06:28:03] <Cork> ?p
[06:28:03] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:28:23] <Cork> don't use a dead pastebin site
[06:28:37] <d0den> so I guess you can't declare variables like this? http://jsbin.com/aziQofA/2/edit
[06:29:12] <d0den> I was hoping the function would declare the variables for me
[06:29:17] <Cork> d0den: you can, but not sure what it would do
[06:29:23] <abailarri> is this http://fixee.org/paste/s7naoal/
[06:29:33] <Cork> dodthe functions will be locally in the function
[06:29:38] <Cork> *d0den:
[06:29:41] <NoiseEee> d0den: why even ask for parameters in that case?
[06:29:43] <Cork> sigh..
[06:29:50] <Cork> *the variables will be local in the function
[06:30:14] <Cork> NoiseEee: i THINK he wants to pass by reference
[06:30:20] <d0den> Cork, oh I see, I didn't realize that's how variables worked
[06:30:22] <Cork> but i might be guessing
[06:30:40] <Cork> d0den: it's called variable scopes
[06:30:51] <Cork> d0den: and each function will create a scope for the variables inside it
[06:31:19] <d0den> Cork, ty
[06:31:25] <Cork> abailarri: please make an example without server code and use one of the live sites
[06:31:37] <Cork> ah, he left
[06:38:23] <doug65536> alexfu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/73fe17299a840a8a7f3ffffcac15e32a88bd3d66/src/effects.js#L579
[06:41:09] <d0den> Haha, despite being fairly dim and being woefully ignorant about what I'm doing, I've gotten everything working :D
[06:42:29] <Thoams> love that feeling
[06:44:30] <d0den> Me too! I get it quite a lot. I don't really know what I'm doing, but there's so, so much to learn that I feel like the only thing I can do is concentrate on building something that works, even if it's extremely inelegant
[06:45:06] <NoiseEee> d0den: thank goodness the architects who built cities didn't think that way
[06:45:10] <Velveeta> that's always a good starting point, then tweak it to make it more and more elegant, until you eventually arrive at good development style :)
[06:45:17] <NoiseEee> d0den: a/k/a/ what have you got to fear by learning
[06:45:41] <d0den> NoiseEee, I agree, but you have to be really sure you want to be an architect before you spend seven years learning how to do it
[06:46:22] <d0den> And when you don't know anything, you don't even know what it is you need to learn and what you can leave for later
[06:47:22] <d0den> I feel like if I'd set out to really understand every piece of the machinery I'm using, I'd have hundreds of hours of reading to do before I built anything, and I'd probably just give up
[06:48:09] <Thoams> this stuff generally follows patterns, and few people do programming without referring to specifc documentation
[06:48:34] <Thoams> good luck, it does rock to get it working but NoiseEee and Velveeta both have a point
[06:48:55] <Velveeta> well, aside from the library functions themselves, the nuts and bolts of javascript can be learned in a fairly short time, most people just jump right in and start learning a particular library/framework without learning the way javascript itself works...
[06:48:56] <Thoams> I was being more camaraderie and less oppression
[06:48:58] <Thoams> (Y)
[06:49:11] <Velveeta> on top of that, once you start learning good patterns and when to use them, that's the part that's a longer learning period :)
[06:50:07] <jeffszusz> hey guys; I'm having some trouble with a jquery UI dialog; I have one particular dialog that will not come to the top of the visual stack of dialogs if multiples are open; I've checked and "movetotop" is called and the order in the stack does change, and focus is called, but still the dialog remains beneath the others. any ideas what i should look into next?
[06:50:51] <jeffszusz> the dialog visibly focuses and has the title bar blue, just doesn't move 'upward' in the z-axis
[06:51:29] <Velveeta> but its zindex value is actually updating as it should?
[06:53:25] <Thoams> does it have position: relative set?
[06:55:00] <jeffszusz> Velveeta, the z-indexes do not change, but I don't know why
[06:55:32] <Velveeta> so what were you referring to when you said "the order in the stack does change"?
[06:56:41] <jeffszusz> crap
[06:56:41] <Velveeta> let me get that dialog code up in front of me and see if i can spot what might be going wrong if it's not even setting the zindex
[06:57:11] <jeffszusz> this _stack attribute is something added by my team then isn't it, rather than belonging to the dialog
[06:57:25] <Cork> if you are talking about jquery ui dialog it DOES change it z-index
[06:57:37] <Cork> it has an internal count and it adds to it every time you open a dialog
[06:57:44] <Cork> (and uses it for the z-index)
[06:58:04] <Velveeta> do you have the modal option set on that dialog?
[06:58:09] <jeffszusz> no
[06:59:30] <Velveeta> hmmm, that's the only thing i see immediately in the moveToTop function that might cause it to exit early
[07:01:05] <Velveeta> outside of that, it looks like it should always be grabbing the maxZ, incrementing it, and applying it to the dialog zIndex, as long as it's not already greater than maxZ
[07:02:30] <jeffszusz> Velveeta, when looking at _moveToTop in jquery.ui.dialog on github, I don't see where it increments z-index
[07:02:35] <Velveeta> you might want to make sure your team didn't override the moveToTop function and hose a portion of it, set a breakpoint in the original function and see if it hits
[07:03:09] <jeffszusz> I'm looking at lines 201 through 206 in jquery.ui.dialog.js
[07:03:13] <Velveeta> what version are you all running on btw? i'm just looking at my own version that we're running internally, but we're on 1.9.2
[07:03:54] <Velveeta> also, my version doesn't have a private _moveToTop, it's a public function "moveToTop" (no underscore), so it definitely sounds like we're on different versions
[07:03:55] <jeffszusz> 1.10 which is hella old but should have the moveToTop method
[07:04:30] <Velveeta> ok let me go take a look at a 1.10 version real quick
[07:04:35] <jeffszusz> yeah i guess i"ll look at the old version too
[07:05:53] <doug65536> jeffszusz: works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5NwP5/
[07:06:53] <jeffszusz> ok
[07:06:54] <jeffszusz> so
[07:06:59] <jeffszusz> MOST of our dialogs do work
[07:07:08] <jeffszusz> it's just this one dialog has something different about it that i can't determine
[07:07:56] <jeffszusz> i'll talk to my team and see if there's something weird going on ; even the dialogs that visibly change are all reporting the same z-index of 100 at any given time, except forthis one dialog that reports a 10
[07:07:57] <jeffszusz> lol
[07:09:30] <Velveeta> so, here's what it looks like is trying to set that moveToTop condition: var moved = !!this.uiDialog.nextAll(":visible").insertBefore( this.uiDialog ).length;
[07:09:52] <Velveeta> it's grabbing all visible dialogs that come as next siblings of the current dialog, and move them to before the current dialog in the dom tree, as previous siblings
[07:10:17] <Velveeta> adjusting the actual dom order of the nodes to set one visible instead of mucking with the zindex
[07:10:24] <doug65536> yes, I knew it wasn't using z-index http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5NwP5/1/
[07:10:47] <Velveeta> however, that's gonna require all of those dialogs being siblings of each otherâ€¦ the one that's not working, is it at the same dom level as those other dialogs that *are* working?
[07:12:33] <doug65536> jeffszusz: did you say what version of jquery ui you are using?
[07:13:01] <Velveeta> he said 1.10, not sure of the patch version, i just checked 1.10.0 for my response
[07:15:00] <doug65536> Velveeta: it doesn't appeat to matter what order they are in the dom http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5NwP5/2/
[07:15:02] <doug65536> appear*
[07:15:10] <rgr> how can I do a jq select for elemtns who dont contain children of a certain class?
[07:15:55] <Velveeta> $('div:not(:has(.className))')
[07:16:33] <Velveeta> doug: if you look at the dom inspector on that jsfiddle link you sent, you'll see that they shift their order around in the dom as you click to bring each one to the top
[07:16:50] <rgr> that selects the div if that div doesnt have a *child* of the specified class?
[07:16:55] <Velveeta> when those elements have the same zindex, the last one wins for stacking order
[07:17:09] <doug65536> Velveeta: oops I did the buttons lol. but this works anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5NwP5/3/
[07:17:14] <Velveeta> rgr: yep yep, anywhere in its descendants
[07:17:20] <rgr> cool. thanks so much.
[07:17:48] <Velveeta> no problemo
[07:17:50] <BillCriswell> Never realized there was a :has, only used .has().
[07:17:56] <doug65536> Velveeta: yes I know
[07:17:58] <Velveeta> the has() function is faster than using it as a pseudo-selector though
[07:18:35] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I figured, just wasn't aware of the pseudo-selector!
[07:18:59] <doug65536> Velveeta: on initialization it seems to .detach() them all, making their starting position in the hierarchy irrelevant
[07:19:05] <Velveeta> although you'd have the not (!) the logic and run it through a filter function for something like that: $('div').filter(function () { return !$(this).has('.className'); });
[07:19:35] <doug65536> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5NwP5/4/
[07:20:09] <jeffszusz> thanks guys, figured it out. had nothing to do with the jquery ui internals
[07:20:39] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented the countdown function on my website but I can not be displayed. I have the code into a paste. Somebody help me? http://pastebin.com/X90F5LWz
[07:20:50] <rgr> Velveeta: thanks. worked a treat and I learnt to read a little better (has v hasClass)!
[07:21:10] <Velveeta> doug: ok i think i see what you're saying, yes, at init time it doesn't matter where they live in the document, as they'll be appended to the body itselfâ€¦ i just figured it was possible that at some point after a cluster was initialized, maybe the body children were wrapped in some container element, and then more dialogs init'd, which would put them at a different dom level
[07:21:26] <doug65536> abailarri: line 12 has an invalid selector
[07:21:31] <Velveeta> rgr: glad to hear it :)
[07:21:36] <ohcibi> hi i'm trying to add a callback for onloadedmetadata event of a <video> element... somehow the callback is not firing. the device runs android 2.3 with its default webview... does anyone know something about compatibility issues?
[07:21:38] <Velveeta> jeff: so what was going on with it?
[07:22:28] <doug65536> abailarri: $('#expireMessageStart')   <-- should look like that
[07:22:40] <abailarri> doug65536: yes I changed it but it is not the problem
[07:23:42] <slax0r> I'm losing my mind in some code, is this ok: .setData('something',true)? can you pass a bool value to setData?
[07:23:46] <doug65536> abailarri: you load jquery itself before the plugin?
[07:24:02] <doug65536> slax0r: setData??
[07:24:14] <abailarri> doug65536: yes
[07:24:16] <doug65536> slax0r: you sure you don't mean .data('something', true)
[07:24:38] <slax0r> if (i<_this.loopedSlides || i>=_this.slides.length-_this.loopedSlides) _this.slides[i].setData('looped', true);
[07:24:38] <Velveeta> well crap, i have to go give 2 hours of interviews now, so i'll be back to help out as i can later :)
[07:24:40] <slax0r> it;s not my code
[07:24:45] <slax0r> it's from a swiper plugin
[07:24:52] <slax0r> I'm debugging it, because it's buggy as hell
[07:25:15] <doug65536> slax0r: you can store anything if setData calls .data
[07:25:41] <slax0r> yeah
[07:25:45] <slax0r> it's an internal function
[07:26:08] <slax0r> anyway, this peace of crap is so buggy... is there any other apple store-like swiper?
[07:27:07] <slax0r> http://www.idangero.us/sliders/swiper/plugins/3dflow.php that's the one I'm using now, but it has just too many bugs
[07:27:23] <slax0r> and I kind of don't have the time to write everything from scratch
[07:34:30] <beaky> hello
[07:34:35] <beaky> should I use jquery?
[07:34:46] <grafi> no
[07:34:54] <beaky> why not?
[07:35:35] <grafi> why should you?
[07:36:14] <beaky> I want to use jquery so that I have an elegant and uniform API for DOM manipulation across all modern browsers
[07:36:27] <beaky> for making sweet webpages
[07:37:31] <NoiseEee> so go for it :)
[07:37:53] <Ricaz> having some problems with WebSockets. if I do: var conn = WebSocket('ws://...'), shouldn't I be able to just conn.send() immediatly after?
[07:38:57] <Cork> Ricaz: no you need to wait for onopen
[07:39:04] <beaky> what is the best way to install and use jquery
[07:39:12] <Cork> Ricaz: the net takes a bit of time to answer after all :)
[07:40:14] <Ricaz> Cork, oh, that explains it, thanks
[07:40:22] <soee> hi, how can i use selector thats class starts with 'foo-' and can have more random characters ?
[07:40:25] <doug65536> beaky: easiest way is to lookup a cdn for jquery then simply add a script tag to head
[07:40:28] <BillCriswell> I smell a troll.
[07:40:45] <beaky> ah thanks
[07:40:54] <beaky> or maybe I should serve my own copy?
[07:40:59] <grafi> oO
[07:41:11] <grafi> no
[07:41:18] <doug65536> beaky: well that wouldn't be the "easiest" way would it
[07:41:21] <Cork> soee: you shouldn't use classes for that
[07:41:27] <NoiseEee> yes i'm on the 'serve your own copy' tip
[07:41:39] <NoiseEee> but yes, just include it is a script and start using it
[07:41:47] <beaky> right I will try it out first
[07:41:53] <doug65536> beaky: but yeah, why let google spy on your users
[07:42:05] <Cork> soee: a class should be used to find a group of elements, if you need to store data use a data- attribute
[07:42:18] <abailarri> doug65536: I aisled the problem. I quit the onExpiry and works
[07:42:32] <Cork> soee: so foo-random makes no sense
[07:42:55] <Cork> soee: an alternative you can do if you need primary and secondary groups is to separate them into two classes
[07:42:56] <fghd> hi all
[07:43:04] <fghd> sorry for my english
[07:43:09] <fghd> i have a question
[07:43:19] <Cork> soee: cause then you can do like .find('.foo') and .find('.foo.additional')
[07:44:13] <fghd> i have this code http://pastebin.com/hbpFgBKy
[07:44:31] <fghd> but why lengths of cats is 0?
[07:44:38] <soee> Cork, i need classes i used: $(".bar div[class*='foo-']")
[07:44:58] <fghd> but cats contain some objects
[07:45:06] <doug65536> I use to think, "wow, google is doing us all such a nice favor by serving jquery for us! google loves us all"... until I realized the bastards are tracking everything you do and matching the referrer up with your IP and your last gmail logon to spy on exactly what pages you visit
[07:45:09] <Cork> soee: that isn't a class selector though
[07:45:35] <NoiseEee> fghd: callbacks. async programming.  gonna have to grasp that to write javascript.
[07:45:50] <Cork> soee: that's an attribute selector and that means the browser has to loop all elements in the dom to find them
[07:46:06] <Cork> soee: and it also generically means you have constructed your classes wrong
[07:46:08] <NoiseEee> fghd: move line 11 to line 8.
[07:46:09] <grafi> NoiseEee dropping truth bombs left and right
[07:47:37] <soee> Cork, why all elements if it there is .bar class at the begining, it should search only in elements with class .bar
[07:48:10] <Cork> soee: css works from left to right
[07:48:11] <soee> and as i have only 2 elements with class .bar that shouldnt take long
[07:48:17] <Cork> opps
[07:48:19] <Cork> sorry right to left
[07:48:28] <moura> is there any way to capture a click on a element inside iframe?
[07:48:45] <fghd> NoiseEee, cats have objects, but cats length is 0
[07:49:02] <Cork> soee: so first it finds all divs in the page, then it check that they have a class attribute, then it check if the attribute has 'foo-' in it
[07:49:12] <Cork> soee: then it check that it has a parent with the class bar
[07:50:13] <NoiseEee> fghd: on the contrary, "cats" does not contain anything at all when its executed on line 11, immediately after executing line 4.  but if you asked for the length *after* the operation of line 4 was *finished*, it would have a length.
[07:51:07] <NoiseEee> fghd: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40 etc
[07:56:08] <Swayz> is it normal I have to use preventDefault right after stopPropagation
[07:56:50] <Thoams> you could just return false
[07:56:54] <Thoams> after doing stuff
[07:57:26] <Swayz> if only it were that easy ;/
[07:57:53] <Swayz> it's not a form i'm preventing from submitting but rather the bootstrap carousel
[07:58:16] <NoiseEee> Swayz: sure, they're used together sometimes if appropriate ?
[07:58:26] <Swayz> ie. <button id="continue" data-target="#myCarousel" data-slide-to="1">Continue</button>
[07:58:51] <Swayz> okay.. I was under the impression that stopProp would prevent the bubble from even reaching the submit action
[08:00:50] <NoiseEee> it would
[08:01:30] <fghd> NoiseEee, i understand, but i need global variable cats and filling this variable
[08:01:41] <NoiseEee> fghd: then you don't understand
[08:01:44] <Swayz> It worked last week.. but I revamped the page and now it was trying to submit it..  I use both and it works now..
[08:02:13] <NoiseEee> fghd: it *will* fill the 'cats' variable, but its simply not finished 'filling' it when you're asking about its length
[08:02:29] <fghd> NoiseEee, what i need to do to have a filled glob var?
[08:02:36] <NoiseEee> fghd: CALLBACKS
[08:02:41] <NoiseEee> ASYNC PROGRAMMING
[08:02:56] <NoiseEee> you must grasp these ideas if you are to have any hope, fghd
[08:03:22] <NoiseEee> Swayz: also putting a type="button" will prevent the button from submitting the form in the first place
[08:04:12] <Swayz> button type="button" .. go figure
[08:04:21] <beaky> what version of jquery should I use as a beginner
[08:04:34] <beaky> are they the same, or are they different the way python2 and python3 are
[08:04:40] <NoiseEee> beaky: always the latest... if you are targetting IE < 10, stay on the 1.x branch
[08:05:00] <beaky> yes my pc is ie9
[08:05:28] <beaky> damn ie always not letting people using the shiny new toys
[08:05:57] <NoiseEee> you're going to want to develop on something other than ie9 fwiw
[08:06:10] <beaky> ok I will get chromium
[08:06:19] <beaky> it has a nice debugger and inspector thing
[08:06:38] * techslice applauds your choice
[08:10:45] <BillCriswell> I'm going to rip my eye out.
[08:11:08] <BillCriswell> If it doesn't stop twitching.
[08:11:40] <NoiseEee> i've had a twitch going in my right eye for like 3 weeks now
[08:11:44] <NoiseEee> i think its the latest jquery version
[08:13:54] * grafi puts his hand on BillCriswell 's face ... and stabs BillCriswell in the throat with a hunting knife. BillCriswell bleeds to death on the pavement.
[08:14:10] <doug65536> grafi: lmao

[08:19:53] <abailarri> does anyone used jquery countdown script? I'm trying to implement onExpiry function but it not works. Anyone used it?
[08:20:31] <grafi> cool stuff

[08:26:06] <moura> is there any way to capture a click on a element inside iframe?
[08:34:02] <bil_> so height() returns the value in px, but is there a way to get it's value in em?
[08:34:48] <yaymukund> can I get an empty selector? how?
[08:34:56] <doug65536> yaymukund: $()
[08:34:56] <NoiseEee> moura: sounds like a great question for google
[08:35:09] <yaymukund> ha, thanks doug65536 . JUST saw the note in the docs :D
[08:35:21] <yaymukund> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#returning-empty-set
[08:35:52] <bil_> yaymukund what would you do with an empty jquery object anyway?

[08:38:55] <abailarri> Is you can see, the button not shows when the count expires
[08:39:10] <doug65536> abailarri: you didn't fix the selector
[08:39:40] <yaymukund> bil_: hacking on an api that uses jQuery stuff. I want a method that always returns a jQuery selector
[08:39:52] <yaymukund> and sometimes there's nothing to select
[08:40:13] <yaymukund> I mean, I'm sure jQuery uses it all the time internally.
[08:40:30] <abailarri> o yes doug65536
[08:40:32] <abailarri> sorru grafi
[08:40:37] <abailarri> *sorry

[08:40:54] <cusco> hi
[08:41:02] <cusco> how do I set several properties at once using .css()
[08:41:17] <yaymukund> can't you pass in an object?
[08:41:22] <grafi> yup
[08:41:34] <yaymukund> cusco: http://api.jquery.com/css/#css-properties
[08:41:45] <doug65536> cusco: .css({position: 'relative', color: '#DDD'})
[08:41:59] <cusco> ahh.. perhaps.. like {color':'green','width':'10px'}
[08:42:02] <cusco> right?
[08:42:16] <doug65536> cusco: .css({position: 'relative', color: '#DDD', 'border-color': '#F00'})

[08:42:58] <yaymukund> (e.g. a '-')
[08:43:22] <yaymukund> actually, I didn't even know js supported quoted keys
[08:43:37] <d0den> nevermind, used indexof()
[08:46:05] <yaymukund> oh yeah, you can. doh, getting mixed up with ruby's new hash style hahaha
[08:50:06] <Ricaz> So I have this: http://pastie.org/8320207 - trouble with events being appended with .on(), not being able to use .off() to remove them. Help, please? :)
[08:51:11] <grafi> btn-delete misses a . ?!
[08:51:14] <doug65536> Ricaz: missing dot in off selector
[08:51:45] <cusco> i'm trying to set the divs appended to tabs
[08:51:47] <cusco> to overflow
[08:51:56] <doug65536> Ricaz: also, that won't work...
[08:52:03] <cusco> when I use 'refresh' the style properties get overwritten it seems
[08:52:11] <doug65536> Ricaz: you are passing a different function. omit the function in the off call
[08:52:17] <cusco> also seems I cannot set it in css to .ui-tabs-panel
[08:52:21] <Ricaz> doug65536, grafi, yeah, sorry, i fixed that, doesn't change anything
[08:52:32] <Ricaz> will try that
[08:52:51] <Ricaz> Oh, that works! Thanks! :D
[08:53:07] <doug65536> Ricaz: passing a function to off means, remove the handler that uses this exact callback function
[08:53:40] <Ricaz> doug65536, I see. I tried without it first, but I guess it didn't work the first time cus I was missing the dot :p
[08:55:09] <Changa> * why is my jqui datepicker not working on this page? any ideas? -> http://sumvision.com/index.php?p=supportfill
[08:57:31] <doug65536> Changa: wow you don't need all that code repetition
[08:58:35] <doug65536> Changa: one comma separated list selector, an each, and use of $(this) could do them all in a few lines
[08:58:45] <Changa> I see doug65536
[08:58:49] <Changa> any idea on the datepicker?
[08:59:05] <doug65536> I don't see where you initialize it. do you?
[08:59:15] <Tumulte> hey again... I've been trying to use jquery from an iframe's parent, but I caqn't
[08:59:46] <Tumulte> did someone succeed with that ?
[08:59:58] <Changa> doug65536 should do , towards end of scripts.js , might have removed it for a sec to try
[09:00:01] <Changa> its there now
[09:04:26] <grafi> Changa put it on top of scripts.js
[09:05:08] <Changa> its there not grafi, still no luck
[09:05:12] <Changa> now*
[09:05:23] <doug65536> Changa: this works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uGMrB/
[09:05:58] <Changa> yes I know doug65536 I'm trying to figure out why doesnt mine work
[09:06:00] <doug65536> Changa: it looks like everything is hidden at the moment you initialize it. I wonder if that causes a problem
[09:06:14] <doug65536> Changa: where do you unhide everything?
[09:06:26] <Changa> hmm yeah maybe thats it
[09:06:36] <Changa> I think I messed up yesterday :()
[09:07:17] <Changa> its fixed now ^_^
[09:07:27] <Xander1> hello
[09:07:35] <Changa> thanks doug65536 / grafi
[09:07:51] <Xander1> question - is it possible to open up a new tab and prefill certain fields in the new opened tab?
[09:09:08] <doug65536> Xander1: you can't open a new tab, you can only open a new window. if the user's browser happens to be configured to use tabs, it will be a new tab
[09:09:26] <doug65536> Xander1: and I suggest not even trying to do that, it's ugly to get it working
[09:09:38] <grafi> opening windows?
[09:09:45] <doug65536> Xander1: use css tabs
[09:09:50] <Xander1> my bad, that's what i mean - open new window
[09:09:58] <Xander1> window.open - works
[09:10:09] <Xander1> im trying to figure out how to prefill form fields
[09:10:21] <grafi> your form?
[09:10:43] <Xander1> our business partner - affiliate
[09:11:07] <grafi> so no control over how the new window behaves?
[09:11:28] <doug65536> Xander1: my_window.document.documentElement is the popups document
[09:11:41] <doug65536> Xander1: but you can't touch it unless the popup is in the same domain as your page
[09:12:01] <Xander1> they have a form - so with a click, we need to open up their link and prefill certain fields with an info that customer filled out on our site
[09:12:02] <grafi> cant touch this
[09:12:11] <Xander1> can't touch what?
[09:12:24] <grafi> what doug65536 said
[09:12:29] <doug65536> Xander1: you cant "reach into" a popup in another domain
[09:12:48] <doug65536> it will throw an access denied exception
[09:13:37] <doug65536> Xander1: if you window.open a url that is in the same domain as your page, you can
[09:14:41] <doug65536> Xander1: if you could do it, it would be used for exploits
[09:14:55] <Xander1> @doug65536 - hmmm i c
[09:15:34] <doug65536> Xander1: you could possibly hack around it though
[09:15:39] <Xander1> is there somethign that could be done like that?
[09:15:44] <Xander1> like a "hack"?
[09:15:57] <doug65536> Xander1: request it from your own server, have the server side code fetch it, and send it
[09:16:05] <doug65536> Xander1: then it will be in your domain
[09:16:14] <grafi> hm
[09:16:23] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4?
[09:16:25] <grafi> baaaaaaad
[09:16:27] <grafi> :P
[09:18:25] <doug65536> Xander1: depending on how poorly implemented their security is, you could even use http://corsproxy.com/the-popup-url.com/ for your window.open url, to see if it works
[09:18:55] <Xander1> damn it
[09:18:59] <doug65536> and use a blank popup and populate it using that url with ajax
[09:19:36] <doug65536> also depends on your customers not being security conscious and double-checking the popup's url
[09:19:52] <doug65536> it will look pretty legitimate if it is from your domain though
[09:20:02] <doug65536> using server side thing I mentioned earlier
[09:20:37] <Xander1> i c
[09:20:48] <Xander1> damn, i thought there would be somewhat of an easy solution/hack
[09:20:57] <doug65536> Xander1: it is easy
[09:21:34] <doug65536> Xander1: what language do you use on the server side?
[09:22:13] <Xander1> serverside - PHP
[09:22:24] <Xander1> not sure what the affiliate is going to use yet
[09:23:09] <doug65536> Xander1: ok, then make a php page that uses curl to fetch the popups url, and echo it to your page from there. have the popup point to that proxy page with a get parameter like /something.php?page=popup-url.com
[09:23:35] <doug65536> Xander1: or hard code it for extra security so that php page specifically gets that popup only
[09:24:12] <doug65536> Xander1: and to refresh your memory about why: the browser will let you manipulate a popup page that came from your domain
[09:24:56] <doug65536> Xander1: it's not a perfect solution, there could be small issues to resolve, dpeending on the content of the affiliate's page
[09:25:16] <doug65536> a <base> tag would solve several of the issues
[09:25:56] <doug65536> Xander1: real solution is not to try to touch the affiliate's page ;)
[09:26:22] <nhulea> yo!
[09:26:48] <Xander1> yeah, i understand that - i've told my management about it and they still insisted on fiding a solution to pre-fill a form on another site
[09:26:59] <nhulea> I am having trouble accessing a variable outside an .each() closure
[09:28:26] <doug65536> nhulea: can you show the code?
[09:28:42] <nhulea> doug65536: yeah I am putting it together right now
[09:29:53] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to do a form with calculated fields so it calculates prices. It works fine except for one thing, i need to multiply some fields and the multiplication is not working.

[09:30:56] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AVLgA/
[09:31:12] <doug65536> dieguezz: you multiply the id? why?
[09:31:28] <doug65536> dieguezz: don't use ids for data. use data attributes
[09:32:00] <dieguezz> [doug65536] i did this with lot of google help, i am noob. what u mean with data attributes?
[09:32:09] <doug65536> dieguezz: <div data-foo="123">    then use .data('foo') on that element
[09:32:15] <nhulea> doug65536: I am trying to get the array of dates to pass to the if condition but when it gets passed it looks like 05/08,15,22,29/2014

[09:34:35] <jethr0> or even 2.x.x
[09:34:54] <doug65536> nhulea: how does your code know which think in arrS to use?
[09:34:58] <doug65536> thing*
[09:35:14] <nhulea> doug65536: I tried arrS[i] but it only resturns the last value in the array
[09:35:33] <nhulea> returns*
[09:36:21] <smallfoot> ahhahaha, jquery.com uses jquery-migrate.js, lol suckers!
[09:36:34] <doug65536> smallfoot: lol
[09:36:57] <smallfoot> they need to upgrade
[09:37:08] <smallfoot> or they think 1.9.1 is better than 1.10.2?
[09:37:13] * doug65536 removes jquery.com from his bookmarks bar in disgust
[09:38:09] <nhulea> doug65536: I want to return all 4 dates to compare against the 3 date values for a match
[09:38:54] <diverdude> Is  this not a valid html element id? rate[3][1]
[09:39:37] <doug65536> diverdude: it is if you make your selector ugly as hell: $('#rate\\[3\\]\\[1\\]')
[09:39:57] <NoiseEee> diverdude: its definitely a huge sign of "code smell" regardless of whether its valid
[09:40:26] <diverdude> doug65536, hmm ok i see...its because i need to create element id's based on 2 numbers
[09:40:46] <diverdude> NoiseEee, ^
[09:40:55] <NoiseEee> diverdude: still code smell.
[09:41:38] <diverdude> NoiseEee, problem is with a limited jquery plugin im using
[09:41:48] <diverdude> NoiseEee, so i have to make a workaround :S
[09:41:52] <NoiseEee> so use "rate_3_1"
[09:42:59] <diverdude> yes...that was also my next plan hehe
[09:43:01] <doug65536> nhulea: you lost me at 3. where does the code do 3 date values? did you mean 4?
[09:43:09] <diverdude> but i totally agree...its sucky code :(
[09:43:55] <doug65536> nhulea: oh I see it
[09:44:23] <doug65536> nhulea: I don't see date1 date2 or date3 anywhere
[09:44:40] <nhulea> doug65536: I have 3 dates that I am trying to compare against 4 dates when I use arrS[i] I get one and then when I use arrS I get the comma deliniated value

[09:45:23] <nhulea> its values from a datepicker
[09:51:39] <vedic> Hello friends, I have about 50 values show on screen. These values are result of the selection of checkboxes and select drop down (i.e. there are 50 checkboxes and select dropdowns). For each of them I have id values.
[09:51:44] <vedic>  I want to write a function such that when I click on any of the values show on the screen, it removes those select and checkboxes values from the respective variables. Something like:
[09:51:48] <vedic>   function onAgeRefineRemove() { $("div#main").on("click", "span#age_refine", function(e) { ageMin = ''; ageMax = ''; }); }. My question is how to avoid writing 50 such functions?
[09:52:59] <nhulea> doug65536: you see what I mean
[09:55:45] <doug65536> nhulea: one moment
[09:55:59] <nhulea> cool

[10:04:39] <BillCriswell> Would you guys say a 3 month contract to full time for a new job is pretty common in the industry?
[10:07:20] <krawchyk> BillCriswell: 6 months is more common probably
[10:07:26] <krawchyk> dont think 3 is uncommon though
[10:13:15] <Tingle> $('main').animate({height:$('main div.accountBodyHeight').attr('value')}, 250); This is choppy, can someone tell me why? When it goes from 600 to 250 its smooth but from 250 to 600 it like delay starts and then jumps/is faster.
[10:21:04] <krawchyk> Tingle: http://kellegous.com/j/2013/01/26/layout-performance/
[10:22:37] <Tingle> mm I just looked through that, how does it help me?
[10:29:25] <BillCriswell> Tingle: How can I trigger the animation?
[10:29:26] <nhulea> why does this only return the last value ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/AVLgA/
[10:31:43] <krawchyk> Tingle: have an example?
[10:31:52] <nhulea> I want to be able to have that var loop through outside of the .each ?
[10:32:16] <krawchyk> nhulea: because you are overwriting the value of springDay each time the loop runs
[10:32:27] <krawchyk> nhulea: so you only alert the lasts value since that is the last value that was assigned
[10:33:02] <krawchyk> nhulea: what do you mean "loop through outside of the .each"?
[10:33:41] <nhulea> krawchyk: I want to be able to loop thru the values when that var i called
[10:33:44] <nhulea> is*
[10:33:56] <nhulea> would that be a funtion
[10:34:02] <nhulea> function
[10:34:18] <krawchyk> so you want to alert each value in arrS?
[10:34:36] <nhulea> yes vut outside the closure of the .each
[10:35:14] <krawchyk> what why? that is what the each is for... im confused at what you need to accomplish
[10:36:03] <nhulea> cause I use it multiple times
[10:36:22] <nhulea> I guess I thought it might something I could call
[10:36:38] <nhulea> so I didint have to wrap all my code in the .each
[10:43:17] <thesisb> Where can I find the source for how DOM selection works in jquery (basically $('.className')
[10:44:25] <thesisb> nvm found it
[10:48:35] <doug65536> nhulea: because it runs the loop to completion before it runs the alert
[10:49:05] <nhulea> doug65536: damn ok cool
[10:49:51] <doug65536> nhulea: you can "break out" of an each loop by returning false from the function
[10:53:29] <doug65536> nhulea: what is that code really trying to do?
[10:54:37] <doug65536> 8, 15, 22, 29 are 7 days apart... I figured that much out. why does it start at 8?
[10:55:02] <nhulea> doug65536: I am trying to compare days for a match
[10:55:20] <nhulea> cause its every thurs in may except 1
[10:56:35] <doug65536> nhulea: js can figure that out for you

[10:57:32] <b-ot> nhulea: No output.
[10:57:38] <doug65536> ?
[10:58:01] <doug65536> js> var now = new Date(); print(now.getDay()); @ nhulea
[10:58:01] <nhulea> doug65536: thanks yeah it is makign sense now

[11:07:11] <doug65536> nhulea: moment probably returns objects, and == won't work on objects
[11:07:29] <doug65536> nhulea: well, it might not work, depending on how moment.js works
[11:07:47] <nhulea> yeah I got it to work before
[11:07:57] <nhulea> with >=

[11:17:47] <nhulea> thanks !
[11:20:04] <doug65536> nhulea: you might want to try: if (date3.diff(springDay) === 0) { ...

[11:27:14] <doug65536> hron84: what does the handler do?
[11:28:44] <hron84> doug65536: currently just pops up an alert window. There is only one form on the whole page, i tried to reach it via standard CSS queries, but submit event does not firing.
[11:29:32] <hron84> doug65536: i tried this to what i do wrong
[11:29:52] <hron84> *to figure out
[11:30:25] <otiuk> any ideas on how to update the slider button with the value the slider is on when the value's changed. see http://jsfiddle.net/LMpGC/ ..
[11:30:56] <doug65536> hron84: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SKWhw/
[11:32:30] <doug65536> hron84: where does your code get loaded? in head?
[11:32:41] <doug65536> hron84: if so it needs to look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SKWhw/1/
[11:33:09] <doug65536> hron84: $(function() { ... this runs when the document is ready ... });
[11:33:40] <doug65536> hron84: also, the code uses preventDefault() to stop the page reload that would happen with a normal submit
[11:34:46] <hron84> doug65536: hmm... i try it out
[11:36:02] <hron84> doug65536: thanks, i missed document ready hook from js header
[11:40:46] <Manusoftar> doug65536: Hey pal, i'm trying to use the bootstrap framework, i choose the slate theme, but it does not include any js and it's not working as it should, what to do now?
[11:41:02] <alexisabril> Is there a document outlining the jquery versioning scheme? Early I know it was revolution.major.minor, but it's unclear if jquery is semantic these days(eg: major.minor.patch)
[11:42:25] <doug65536> Manusoftar: here's a cdn //netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js
[11:42:40] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you must load jquery befpre that though
[11:43:38] <lukasz4> in html code, in id parameter i have '.' in name, how can i use this id in jquery?
[11:43:56] <lukasz4> $('#name.name') doesnt work
[11:44:05] <doug65536> lukasz4: 1) don't do that, 2) $('#\\.something')
[11:44:35] <lukasz4> thanks
[11:45:13] <doug65536> is today "bad id day" :D
[11:45:34] <doug65536> lukasz4: someone earlier had a similar problem, but with [] characters
[11:46:00] <Kambfhase> why would you want to name something `foo[bar]`?
[11:46:22] <Manusoftar> never mind, it was just the Dreamweaver preview, it seems like dw just cant preview the bootstrap design!
[11:46:30] <Manusoftar> it works fine on browser
[11:46:36] <thesisb> if you have an obj foo with a property bar
[11:47:22] <doug65536> Manusoftar: the embedded browser might be choking on the lack of a protocol in your src attributes (when loading from file://)
[11:47:39] <doug65536> Manusoftar: try putting http: before any src or href that begins with //
[11:47:50] <Kambfhase> I find your lack of protocol disturbing.
[11:49:06] <doug65536> Manusoftar: what happens is, if you omit the protocol and begin the path with //, it uses the same protocol as the page. in that case it might try to find file://... and not find it
[12:01:46] <nhulea> doug65536: its workign great !
[12:03:39] <doug65536> nhulea: nice
[12:04:45] <dllama> hi guys
[12:05:45] <nhulea> doug65536: so is it possible to compare js objects ?
[12:06:00] <nhulea> I was looking around it seems like it is possible
[12:08:55] <doug65536> yes, but unless the object implements it, equality will check whether they refer to the same instance of the object

[12:31:46] <tofra> I expect no text at all..
[12:31:53] <tofra> or am I missing something?
[12:32:50] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[12:32:51] <Bloomberg> Someone here has wored with mpdf?
[12:33:51] <doug65536> tofra: you use $.parseXML?
[12:36:12] <doug65536> tofra: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Yk8b4/1/
[12:37:10] <dllama> whats the most effective way of keeping track of whether or not a select option has already been selected?  i have a bunch of product select's and i'm keeping track of the total with jq.  so what i'm doing now is adding a "counted" class to a to a select once its been changed, but added to the total, but am having some trouble figuring out how to keep a track in case it changes, for instance product 1 is selected @ $8.99, but then 
[12:37:31] <snover> donâ€™t use the DOM as a data store and you wonâ€™t have problems like that
[12:37:45] <tofra> doug65536: let me check..
[12:37:56] <alexfu> Is there a way to remove a fadeIn effect permanently from an element?
[12:38:06] <dllama> snover, was that to me or to someone else?
[12:38:18] <snover> it was to you
[12:38:50] <dllama> sorry, i'm not following what you mean.
[12:39:00] <doug65536> alexfu: there is no fade in "effect" on an element. it animates the opacity, then sets the display to whatever it was when it got hidden
[12:39:12] <doug65536> s/then/and/
[12:39:38] <snover> you are trying to store application state within the dom. this is wrong. store the application state inside javascript objects, modify those objects in response to events on the dom, and update the dom in response to changes to the objects
[12:40:01] <Velveeta> are you asking if, once you bind say, a click event to something to fadeIn another element, how can you unbind the fadeIn effect as part of that at a later time?
[12:40:39] <dllama> snover, thast actually where i was headed towards, but am a little confused with the logic.  i was thinking of maybe storing an array of select id's & their respective values and checking against that on change.
[12:41:48] <tofra> doug65536: I see, I don't use .parseXML().. I just do:  $(response).find('test')
[12:42:29] <doug65536> tofra: yeah, that won't work correctly. an xml document is not the same thing
[12:42:54] <Velveeta> dllama: you can store a list of references to select nodes themselves in a jquery collection, such that when an option is selected, you add the select element to the collection (it should return the same collection if the element is already in it) and then loop through the collection and re-tally the total each time you get a change event
[12:43:03] <plambwk> so I'm trying to get the browser to transition 'slow' on an anchor link click
[12:43:09] <plambwk> can someone tell me why this code doesn't work
[12:43:09] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/YWshq/3/
[12:43:22] <tofra> Should I always use .parseXML for the response?
[12:43:23] <Velveeta> then you don't have to figure out what's already been selected and added to the total or not, you just recalculate the whole thing with direct dom handles, to minimize parsing
[12:43:47] <Velveeta> which is pretty much was shover just said, store a collection of data and refresh your view (total) from that collection
[12:44:00] <Velveeta> snover*
[12:44:01] <plambwk> nevermind
[12:44:50] <dllama> Velveeta, thanks for the explanation!  snower thank you as well
[12:45:04] <menikmati> i'm trying to parse json after using an ajax request is there a reason why the top request does not work and the bottom does? http://pastebin.com/a3wSY1wB
[12:45:23] <dllama> sorry if this is a silly follow up question, but how would i go about storing the a list of references?  (haven't really touched jquery in a little bit due to focusing mostly on rails)
[12:46:30] <doug65536> plambwk: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YWshq/7/
[12:48:01] <plambwk> appreciate it doug
[12:48:24] <Velveeta> dllama: you can just do like selectedItems = $([]);
[12:48:43] <Velveeta> and then add a change event to each select that says selectedItems = selectedItems.add(this);
[12:48:55] <Velveeta> and then loop through selectedItems and recalculate the total
[12:49:10] <dllama> Velveeta, thanks!  trying that now, started already on something similar, jsut wasn't sure on the terminology :)
[12:49:12] <doug65536> plambwk: return false is a bit aggressive, it also stops propagation. updated: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YWshq/8/
[12:49:18] <Velveeta> good luck :)
[12:49:18] <dllama> the thought process was similar thoug
[12:49:23] <dllama> though*
[12:49:24] <dllama> ha thanks

[13:06:02] <plambwk> doug65536: do you find that way better than this one?

[13:06:25] <guideX> how do you append a video tag in ie8?
[13:06:33] <dllama> Velveeta, just to be clear, is this what you had in mind? https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/1732f872a55878ce8361
[13:06:47] <doug65536> plambwk: the one I just linked won't even attach click handlers unless it is a link to an anchor within the page
[13:07:13] <plambwk> and thats a better solution?
[13:07:27] <doug65536> plambwk: yes, yours puts a handler on every a
[13:07:30] <plambwk> okay
[13:07:49] <doug65536> plambwk: and yours uses return false, not a good practice
[13:08:32] <plambwk> hmm
[13:08:34] <doug65536> plambwk: your life is easier when propagation isn't mysteriously stopped. it's a pain to figure that out when events are mysteriously disappearing
[13:08:44] <plambwk> i just stuck it in my html and it doesnt appear to be working
[13:08:49] <plambwk> did you change the html in that fiddle as well
[13:09:01] <doug65536> why html,body
[13:09:05] <doug65536> no I didn't touch the html
[13:09:11] <plambwk> mind if i pm?

[13:27:04] <doug65536> BillCriswell: yes
[13:33:03] <nafta> Hello, I would like to ask what does this do? $.getJSON('/fruit-varities.php', {fruitName:$('#fruitName').val()}, function(data) { I mean, I know what the $.getJSON part does but the {fruitName:$('#fruitName').val()} is what's driving me insane
[13:33:07] <nafta> is it a conditional?
[13:33:31] <BillCriswell> nafta: Probably grabbing the value of an input and passing it as a get parameter.
[13:34:03] <BillCriswell> nafta: So in your PHP you could do <?php echo $_GET['fruitName'] ?>... just throw that bad boy right in a SQL query!
[13:34:12] <BillCriswell> Just kidding don't do that, but the first part is serious.
[13:35:08] <nafta> basically what I'm trying to achieve is to populate a dropdown with data from mysql and make the next dropdown dependant of that first select...
[13:35:53] <bigLanky> anyone know how to disable a set of checkboxes with similar class when a master checkbox is checked
[13:36:04] <bigLanky> ie) checkbox 1 gets checked... the other 5 are grayed out
[13:36:08] <nafta> BillCriswell you think that part {fruitName:$('#fruitName').val()} could be asking for a parameter of the select with the class fruitName?
[13:36:18] <NoiseEee> well what your code is doing is sending the value of the <input id='fruitName'> to the /fruit-varities.php page as a $_GET parameter
[13:36:30] <BillCriswell> nafta: If $('#fruitName') is a select it's just the value of that select.
[13:36:45] <nafta> man, that clarifies a lot
[13:36:48] <nafta> thanks to both of you
[13:36:53] <BillCriswell> No problemoooooo

[13:38:30] <nafta> BillCriswell you ready for another challenge?
[13:38:31] <nafta> :D
[13:38:42] <ppppp> haha, this is hilarious
[13:38:42] <BillCriswell> nafta: Ehhh, I'm so god damn lazy.
[13:38:52] <nafta> :(
[13:38:55] <ppppp> BillCriswell: take that man's money!
[13:39:38] <BillCriswell> ppppp: My laziness knows no bounds.
[13:40:00] <grafi> go team criswell
[13:40:19] <BillCriswell> nafta: It's a very good thing to get comfortable with. I feel like people try to accomplish what you're trying to accomplish a lot
[13:40:21] <grafi> nafta explain why you cant do that tiny thing yourself
[13:40:37] <NoiseEee> plus nafta, learning is good for you, you know?
[13:41:19] <p3lim> Anyone here experienced with indexeddb? I've got a question about the transaction API
[13:42:03] <BillCriswell> nafta: I guarantee a half ass google will pretty much spoon feed you the answer.
[13:42:10] <nafta> learning is amazing...and I apreciate it...and love it..the problem is that I've learned to value the work of others as I value my time. I can't spend too much time learning on how to do this...it is more valuable for me to have it done by an expert.
[13:42:44] <nafta> since I'm on schedule
[13:42:59] <NoiseEee> and your long-term goal is to just keep hiring out people instead of learning to do things yourself?
[13:43:31] <grafi> sounds good to me
[13:43:38] <nafta> NoiseEee I don't plan to know it all, I know how to do certain things...I count on others to do the things I don't know how to do
[13:43:45] <nafta> it is fair for everyone...don't you think?
[13:44:06] <NoiseEee> well considering freenode is a learning/teaching network really
[13:44:17] <nafta> if you are DAMN good with jquery...I'll prefer to pay for your work and give value to it..instead of trying to do it myself
[13:44:24] <NoiseEee> what certain things do you plan on knowing?  how to delegate to people?
[13:44:28] <nafta> NoiseEee touchÃ©
[13:44:36] <Velveeta> project management
[13:44:37] <grafi> thats a valuable skill though
[13:44:38] <grafi> ...
[13:44:50] <nafta> that's one Velveeta
[13:45:44] <nafta> there should be a hiring network
[13:45:53] <grafi> there probably is ^^
[13:45:57] <Velveeta> there are several of them
[13:46:04] <Velveeta> rentacoder.com, scriptlance.com, guru.com, etc
[13:46:05] <nafta> but on irc
[13:46:28] <nafta> I've found people coming to freenode...to grab pieces of code made by others and charge to clients
[13:46:39] <nafta> I don't understand why that's normal
[13:46:40] <BillCriswell> rentacoder is a real thing? whoa.
[13:46:59] <grafi> you could be rich BillCriswell
[13:47:00] <grafi> :P
[13:47:10] <BillCriswell> Haha I missed the boat.
[13:47:20] <grafi> to richland?
[13:47:21] <grafi> xD
[13:47:33] <ppppp> why's everyone hassling the person who wants to pay us?
[13:47:41] <Velveeta> nafta: if people are grabbing code samples here and charging to clients, i don't know if i would consider that normal
[13:47:42] <nafta> I'll keep reading guys, I apreciate the amazing help
[13:47:47] <NoiseEee> teach a fish to learn, ppppp
[13:47:51] <NoiseEee> or something like that
[13:47:55] <grafi> swim
[13:47:57] <grafi> you mean
[13:47:58] <ppppp> I mean, I'm here to learn and share my knowledge, but I also have a job with a boss who pays me for my abilities
[13:47:58] <Velveeta> i'm not quite sure what you're looking to accomplish
[13:47:59] <BillCriswell> I bet there's a lot of people charging far too little and cranky clients trying to get good coders trying to fix what they screwed up.
[13:48:00] <grafi> oÃ´
[13:48:08] <Velveeta> i didn't read back far enough, i'm sitting in a meeting right now :D
[13:48:19] <ppppp> I don't hassle my boss or a client if they ask me to do something for money
[13:48:22] <grafi> yeah BillCriswell thats the new business
[13:49:00] <ppppp> also, this person's username is nafta = north american free trade agreement. lol
[13:49:02] <nafta> the idea of this network blows my mind...it is amazing that people are more into teaching that charging
[13:49:05] <nafta> really nice
[13:49:12] <ppppp> it is nice
[13:49:21] <grafi> well its not really the same thing oÃ´
[13:49:23] <nafta> that* = than
[13:49:44] <BillCriswell> Mastery is a big motivation for me... I know I'll never master it, but trying is fun.
[13:50:26] <BillCriswell> autonomy, that's the word I'm looking for.
[13:50:28] <grafi> BillCriswell will one day be a master pokemon trainer
[13:50:29] <grafi> !!!
[13:50:45] <BillCriswell> Wait.. is that the right word?
[13:50:54] <grafi> pokemon trainer?
[13:51:03] <grafi> dolphinately
[13:52:20] <Velveeta> i'll typically hand out an answer in here, but i like to try to educate about the "why" at the same time
[13:52:22] <BillCriswell> I never got into Pokemon. My brother was into them for a bit, being the older brother I think I had to assume they were stupid.
[13:52:43] <BillCriswell> nafta: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc
[13:52:45] <grafi> :D
[13:52:47] <BillCriswell> ah, he left.
[13:52:53] <BillCriswell> Wondering why my tab wasn't working.
[13:53:09] <grafi> he didnt even tell us waht the problem was
[13:53:10] <grafi> ^^
[13:53:23] <Velveeta> and at my company we're big on the educational factor internally, even going so far as our front-end engineers organizing courses for our back end engineers to take, so when they inevitably have to touch our code since they outnumber us, we don't have to refactor it all later :D
[13:53:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah. I try to do that as well. Wish I was more like NoiseEee who kind of yells at them and makes them thing for themselves.
[13:53:31] <BillCriswell> them think*
[13:53:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That's interesting. I like that.
[13:53:56] <NoiseEee> i only do that because i can't physically spank them
[13:54:04] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I know. I admire that.
[13:54:09] <Velveeta> well that's definitely one approach, shame them into learning :D
[13:54:10] <grafi> NoiseEee missed a great career in teaching
[13:54:22] <grafi> in 1930
[13:54:23] <grafi> ...
[13:54:25] <grafi> :D
[13:54:54] <Velveeta> bill: yeah, it's one selling point for us with interview candidates, it's hard to find qualified front end engineers
[13:55:29] <BillCriswell> I'd be cool with a teacher kicking my hypothetical kids ass if he was being a dick.
[13:55:31] <grafi> who would have thought
[13:57:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, when we've interviewed we'd had a lot of people show up who are pretty bad.
[13:58:06] <Lobosque> anyone know of any script that helps doing this scrolling thing here? http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/
[13:58:08] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I get most annoyed when they have things on their resume, and you ask them about it and they're clueless.
[13:58:45] <BillCriswell> Lobosque: You could get something class with .animate() and .scrollTop()
[13:59:09] <Velveeta> yeah there's a handful of us that pre-vet resumes, then do phone screens, then face to face interviews for the people that get that farâ€¦ it's not *often* that people squeak through with false credentials, but there are definitely people that lack any depth in most categories
[13:59:28] <Velveeta> and we usually break them down into a quivering puddle by the end of our grill sessions :D
[13:59:32] <Lobosque> BillCriswell I think the biggest pain here is making sure each "state" fills the viewport
[13:59:38] <nhulea> Lobosque: try this https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr
[13:59:54] <Lobosque> I mean... it's totally doable, I just feel like there's something like that out already
[14:00:21] <Lobosque> nhulea thank you
[14:00:27] <Lobosque> I will take a look at that
[14:00:35] <nhulea> Lobosque: you got that library is super fun to use
[14:00:42] <nhulea> you got it
[14:02:03] <nhulea> Lobosque: http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/examples/snapping.html
[14:02:47] <Lobosque> nhulea perfect!
[14:02:53] <nhulea> wrd
[14:06:22] <doug65536> Lobosque: there are hundreds of plugins for that. it's called a slider
[14:07:11] <doug65536> the one on the apple site is pretty poor. it forces you to look at each slide for a full second before you can scroll again
[14:07:25] <Lobosque> doug65536 skrollr does exactly what I want, and I woulnd't call it a slider
[14:07:37] <Lobosque> yeah I got annoyed by that too
[14:07:41] <timwis> Help! I'm losing a silly argument about programming!   A friend of mine is using $.ajax() with datatype "jsonp", and somehow his error callback is being triggered instantly when he doesn't get a successful response back. How is that possible?! I thought you couldn't detect the error with jsonp?!!
[14:07:42] <doug65536> Lobosque: who cares what you would call it. it's called a slider
[14:07:48] <Lobosque> also the last 2 "slides" are weird
[14:08:45] <doug65536> Lobosque: https://www.google.ca/search?q=jquery+slider
[14:29:59] <nafta> BillCriswell would you mind on taking a look at a piece of code?
[14:30:11] <BillCriswell> Sure thing!
[14:30:13] <nafta> I'm trying to figure out why it won't work
[14:30:16] <nafta> hold on a sex
[14:30:18] <nafta> err sec
[14:31:46] <prc3webs> newer to jquery. If i just want this fucntion (SortableTable.find) to run when an element on a page loads how would I do that?  The element does not load at the same time the rest of the page does.  It loads after because as data changes on the page it has to reload and I need that function to run each time it reloads
[14:32:52] <nafta> BillCriswell http://pastebin.com/pnWF90E0
[14:33:10] <nafta> it is divided by the javascript part, the html part, and the php part
[14:33:33] <nafta> I'm trying to populate the select from that query
[14:36:02] <BillCriswell> nafta: Are you getting an error?
[14:36:10] <nafta> no, just nadda
[14:36:29] <BillCriswell> Are you actually calling populateBanks() ?
[14:36:38] <nafta> BillCriswell if I run the php by itself...it gets all the data
[14:36:54] <nafta> BillCriswell no LOL
[14:37:00] <nafta> wtf
[14:37:05] <nafta> wait
[14:37:08] <BillCriswell> nafta: Haha.
[14:37:57] <nafta> you mean something like $(document).ready(function) {populateBanks() }?
[14:38:19] <nafta> I don't get it, where should I make the call?
[14:38:39] <BillCriswell> nafta: That can work, if your scripts are in the footer just populateBanks() can work.
[14:38:52] <nafta> no, it is at the header
[14:39:03] <nafta> err after the header
[14:39:29] <BillCriswell> nafta: Then putting it in the document ready should be good.
[14:40:50] <maxmoore14> anyone know when theme roller will be updated for jqm 1.4?
[14:42:17] <nafta> BillCriswell I don't know how to call it correctly, doing the document ready thing is not working
[14:42:17] <nafta> hehe
[14:42:39] <BillCriswell> Is there an error in the console?
[14:43:48] <nafta> no error in firebug console
[14:45:39] <BillCriswell> nafta: What is you just do console.log( data ); in the getJSON callback?
[14:46:43] <BillCriswell> What if you*
[14:47:37] <nafta> nadda
[14:47:53] <BillCriswell> Do you see the request being made in the Network tab?
[14:48:00] <nafta> I'm pretty sure I'm doing something stupid
[14:48:01] <nafta> haha
[14:49:11] <nafta> I only see GET transaction.php
[14:49:15] <jhoffmcd> hi guys, my first .change() event does nothing, only subsequent events do anything
[14:49:51] <BillCriswell> nafta: Then the call function doesn't appear to be getting called.
[14:49:55] <raj> window.onhashchange doesn't seem to be catching the hash update from History.js--> `History.pushState(null, '', 'http://www.mysite.com/raj#bottom')`
[14:49:57] <nafta> in Javascript I see nothing related to the function populateBanks
[14:50:23] <BillCriswell> What if you just type: populateBanks(); into the console.
[14:50:29] <BillCriswell> Does Chrome try to auto fill it?
[14:51:04] <nafta> BillCriswell yay! I get errors!! nice
[14:51:14] <BillCriswell> So you're not actually calling it haha.
[14:51:17] <nafta> data is not defined...rows is not defined
[14:51:23] <BillCriswell> Hmmm.
[14:51:43] <jhoffmcd> nevermind!!!
[14:52:16] <BillCriswell> nafta: rows should be data.
[14:52:32] <nhulea> later
[14:52:37] <BillCriswell> and not sure why data isn't working. From the console.log() earlier is it showing thew hole string?
[14:52:38] <nhulea> have a fun
[14:52:40] <BillCriswell> Later!
[14:52:45] <BillCriswell> I hope to have two funs.
[14:54:14] <BillCriswell> nafta: I'd make sure that request is not 404ing. I'd also make sure the content-type is correct. In your PHP file you might have to put like header("Content-Type: application/json"); at the top.
[14:54:22] <nafta> BillCriswell I GET SOMETHING!
[14:54:29] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome.
[14:54:31] <grafi> Wohooo
[14:54:34] <BillCriswell> I assume it's just sending it as text.
[14:54:36] <grafi> welcome back nafta :P
[14:54:45] <BillCriswell> The header() should make it listen right?
[14:54:52] <nafta> if I change row to data
[14:54:57] <nafta> and run it thru the console
[14:55:01] <nafta> I get the data
[14:55:09] <nafta> but not filled in the select
[14:55:40] <grafi> is the page accessible from the web?
[14:55:41] <grafi> Ã´o
[14:55:41] <nafta> filled...is that an english word?
[14:55:41] <nafta> wtf
[14:55:59] <nafta> grafi I can upload it
[14:56:00] <nafta> :D
[14:56:06] <grafi> if you dont mind
[14:56:08] <grafi> :o
[14:56:11] <nafta> yes hold on
[14:56:27] <grafi> with the database stuff?
[14:56:28] <grafi> :P
[14:56:31] <BillCriswell> nafta: I'd console.log( item ); and make sure it's what you think it is.
[14:56:41] <BillCriswell> I have to run  though. It's 6!
[14:56:45] <BillCriswell> Good luck!
[14:56:51] <grafi> Basically RUN
[14:56:57] <grafi> bb BillCriswell
[14:56:58] <grafi> :)

[15:04:45] <grafi> dont thank me yet ^^
[15:05:51] <raj> window.onhashchange doesn't seem to be catching the hash update from History.js--> `History.pushState(null, '', 'http://www.mysite.com/raj#bottom')`
[15:06:40] <nafta> grafi
[15:06:42] <nafta> uploading
[15:06:53] <nafta> grafi thanks a lot btw
[15:07:28] <grafi> time travel
[15:07:29] <grafi> oÃ´
[15:08:16] <nafta> grafi uploading bootstrap is a PAIN
[15:09:07] <grafi> i feel like you are going overboard with the uploading xD
[15:14:14] <nafta> grafi ready
[15:15:19] <grafi> give it up
[15:15:24] <grafi> url
[15:15:25] <nafta> http://www.fostnet.net/blot/transaction2.php
[15:15:28] <grafi> woooo
[15:15:39] <nafta> and http://www.fostnet.net/blot/banks.php
[15:15:49] <nafta> there's the json data
[15:16:12] <nafta> what I'm trying to do is...populate the "Contraparte" field
[15:16:13] <nafta> :P
[15:17:01] <nafta> if you could give me a hint or two...I might give you a kidney
[15:17:17] <dwarder> which template engine would you suggest?
[15:19:16] <nafta> please grafi do not insult me
[15:19:17] <nafta> haha
[15:19:23] <grafi> ok
[15:19:24] <grafi> so
[15:19:44] <grafi> its working fine for me, when I enter the javascript you posted in the pastebin into the console
[15:20:04] <nafta> are you getting the field populated?!
[15:20:06] <nafta> how?!!
[15:20:07] <nafta> haha
[15:20:09] <raj> While on `http://www.mysite.com/raj` and clicking an `<a href='http://www.mysite.com/raj#bottom'>`, `window.onhashchange=URLlistener` doesn't seem to trigger. The url's hash is being updated using History.js--> `History.pushState(null, '', 'http://www.mysite.com/raj#bottom')`
[15:20:13] <grafi> but you have somekind of select magic in there that turns the select into html
[15:20:23] <grafi> and thats not getting updated
[15:20:56] <nafta> I have no idea what I did really
[15:20:58] <nafta> lol
[15:21:14] <grafi> cool
[15:21:16] <grafi> :P
[15:21:21] <nafta> you think there's a solution?
[15:21:29] <grafi> probably
[15:21:33] <grafi> im looking for it
[15:21:34] <grafi> :P
[15:21:37] <nafta> thanks a lot
[15:22:00] <nafta> after this..I need to make the next select dependant on what I select in the first select
[15:22:02] <nafta> hahaha
[15:24:44] <dwarder> is there an official template engine
[15:24:44] <dwarder> ?
[15:24:49] <dwarder> for jquery?
[15:26:07] <JimmyXander> Okay here is what I am trying to do. $'.button' on (click) ver code = get('document.html'); $('article.class').html(code) when(finished loading) then($'article.class').slidedown
[15:26:12] <JimmyXander> how do I do that?
[15:26:53] <JimmyXander> In plain english. I want to click a button and fill an element with html from a different document. then when everything is loaded I want it to show
[15:28:02] <JFranks> So if I want to use 'blind' or another effect to 'show' an item when a cursor is hovering over another item, I cannot 'display:none' I have to 'hide' it first then 'show' it with an effect? Why are the examples always the opposite of what I want to figure out? :)
[15:29:28] <nafta> grafi maybe bootstrap?
[15:29:48] <JimmyXander> yeah cool, but my question?
[15:29:51] <JimmyXander> =D
[15:30:10] <talntid> dwarder http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/
[15:30:21] <grafi> and then what?
[15:30:49] <nafta> then what what?
[15:30:50] <nafta> hehe
[15:30:53] <nafta> :P
[15:30:57] <grafi> bootstrap
[15:31:00] <grafi> and then what?
[15:31:22] <nafta> no lol
[15:31:27] <nafta> that bootstrap is giving the problem
[15:31:37] <nafta> maybe
[15:31:53] <grafi> no
[15:32:02] <grafi> i dont think so
[15:32:05] <JimmyXander> woah, smack down in the web channel
[15:32:10] <JimmyXander> it's getting hot in there
[15:32:18] <grafi> lol JimmyXander
[15:32:19] <grafi> :P
[15:32:25] <JimmyXander> I'm so bored
[15:32:46] <JimmyXander> I should really take up a hobby...
[15:32:52] <JimmyXander> like knittingâ€¦or php...
[15:33:11] <talntid> you could do my javascript work. haha :)
[15:33:28] <JimmyXander> I don't know shit about javascript
[15:33:38] <JimmyXander> I can barely make jquery stuff work.
[15:33:46] <JimmyXander> That's why I'm here in the first place
[15:34:03] <JimmyXander> Got something I'm supposed to finish tonight, and no idea how I'm going to accomplish it
[15:34:32] <JimmyXander> omg they are throwing BIG words like grenades over there...
[15:34:36] <mike_f> Inline anonymous functions
[15:34:44] * JimmyXander makes boom sounds 
[15:35:18] <mike_f> $(html_element_specifier).bind("action", function(stuff) { ... });
[15:35:51] <shoky> JimmyXander:  $('.mybutton').click(function() { $('article.class').load('document.html', function() { $(this).slideDown(); }); });
[15:37:08] <JimmyXander> wait fo shizzle?
[15:37:13] <JimmyXander> that's it?
[15:37:22] <JimmyXander> I don't need like deferred objects and shit?
[15:37:44] <grafi> so nafta any reason for the chosen plugin to be on this page (yet) ?
[15:37:45] <shoky> nah
[15:37:48] <grafi> or at all
[15:38:24] <grafi> hm you are using it
[15:38:26] <grafi> at least
[15:38:28] <nafta> grafi what plugin?
[15:38:31] <nafta> the bootstrap?
[15:38:31] <grafi> chosen
[15:38:36] <JimmyXander> and it won't slide down until its all finished loading then?
[15:38:45] <grafi> <script src="vendors/chosen.jquery.min.js">
[15:38:51] <nafta> grafi no
[15:39:03] <nafta> where the hell is that?
[15:39:04] <nafta> hahaha
[15:39:13] <grafi> at the bottom of the page
[15:39:14] <grafi> :P
[15:39:28] <nafta> grafi remove it?
[15:39:33] <grafi> comment it out
[15:39:54] <grafi> maybe you should find another plugin that is less buggy afterwards
[15:40:51] <nafta> I don't even know what that plugin does
[15:40:52] <nafta> haha
[15:40:58] <nafta> it is all downloaded from bootstrap
[15:41:18] <grafi> really oÃ´
[15:41:34] <JimmyXander> I've got the rugrats theme song stuck in my head.
[15:42:09] <nafta> grafi only the call to the script? or the function also?
[15:42:19] <plambwk> how did the rugrats theme song go again
[15:42:43] <grafi> well the function will only error without the script, so comment it out
[15:42:54] <nafta> done
[15:42:59] <nafta> now it all looks ugly
[15:43:00] <nafta> haha
[15:43:09] <grafi> in the same step you should probably also put the getjson stuff inside document ready or something
[15:43:22] <grafi> assuming you want to fetch tha bank data on page load?
[15:43:28] <JimmyXander> plambwk: it's all like "dun dun dun DUN DUN DUN DUN dun dunnnnnn"
[15:43:29] <nafta> yes of course
[15:43:58] <grafi> ok, then do that
[15:44:16] <grafi> after that the select will be updated with the information
[15:46:27] <nafta> you think?!
[15:46:29] <nafta> let's see
[15:46:30] <nafta> :D
[15:46:34] <grafi> works for me
[15:46:38] <nafta> :O
[15:46:51] <grafi> when I do it manually ^^
[15:47:49] <dwarder> talntid: which one is easyer to use?
[15:48:16] <talntid> i like underscore
[15:50:44] <guideX> anyone know how to add a video tag to the ie8 dom?
[15:52:22] <duch_kazatel> guideX huh?
[15:52:30] <duch_kazatel> add a tag...
[15:52:31] <duch_kazatel> done.
[15:53:08] <guideX> hmm it's not working with the <video> tag
[15:53:12] <guideX> in the end, it's just not in the dom
[15:53:30] <JimmyXander> end your misery.
[15:53:30] <JimmyXander> <!--[if lt IE 9]><html style="display:none;"><![end if]-->
[15:53:34] <JimmyXander> =)
[15:53:36] <grafi> :D
[15:53:39] <guideX> i'm doing it like this... completedTemplate.appendTo(this._idOfLocationToPlace);
[15:53:44] <guideX> heh
[15:53:45] <guideX> I wish
[15:53:48] <grafi> thats great JimmyXander
[15:54:01] <JimmyXander> =P
[15:55:35] <grafi> still there nafta?
[15:55:42] <guideX> other ideas?
[15:55:45] <JimmyXander> Actually that was wrong of me
[15:55:49] <guideX> no its ok
[15:55:50] <guideX> I agree
[15:55:51] <JimmyXander> I shouldn't have used inline styles
[15:55:55] <guideX> oh heh
[15:56:10] <guideX> no but really, how do I do it? i've been at it for too long
[15:57:15] <JimmyXander> <!--[if lt IE 9]><html class="oldie"><![end if]-->   and then in your CSS .oldie body{ display:none; } .oldie html:before{content:'Get a real browser';}
[16:14:32] <dwarder> i like this template engine https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl what is so bad about it?
[16:14:54] <dwarder> does it work with the latest jquery?
[16:15:23] <dwarder> i like it 'cause i wachter the video and how easy it was to create a template
[16:15:27] <dwarder> watched*
[16:15:42] <dwarder> and saw how easy .... *
[16:16:29] <Velveeta> so for one thing, i'd say it's bad that it's no longer being actively developed
[16:16:45] <guideX> can someone help me with this? I can't get ie8 to load the <video> tag http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39573
[16:17:00] <Velveeta> but on top of that, at my company, we previously used jquery templates, and are transitioning everything over to handlebars
[16:17:17] <grafi> wohhooo handlebars
[16:17:26] <dwarder> i see
[16:17:27] <Velveeta> and some of the negative w/ jquery.tmpl is that debugging them is a friggin nightmare
[16:17:48] <dwarder> i guess i need to watch a handlebars tutorial
[16:17:51] <Velveeta> but outside of that, they're much slower in general than something like handlebars, i'm sure there are jsperf tests out there to demonstrate that
[16:18:12] <Velveeta> handlebars is a pretty simple conversion for the most part, but the biggest thing you have to get over is that it's mostly logicless
[16:18:36] <Velveeta> so you can't do some things in it that you could do in jquery.tmpl like {{if someVar == 7}} or whatever
[16:19:05] <Velveeta> you have to register helper functions with it and do your logic there like {{#if isEqual someVar 7}}
[16:19:58] <dwarder> Velveeta: so it is like smarty
[16:20:01] <dwarder> Velveeta: for php
[16:20:41] <Velveeta> it's been a long time since i worked w/ smarty templates, or php for that matter, i can't remember if smarty was logicless or not
[16:21:04] <dwarder> not sure i understand logicless in this context
[16:21:21] <dwarder> what is logicles in this context?
[16:21:36] <Velveeta> logicless as in you're supposed to keep conditional-type program flow out of your templates as much as possible
[16:21:37] <saganbyte> Hello there
[16:21:58] <Velveeta> so don't render chunks based on whether statements pass evaluations or not
[16:22:29] <saganbyte> I ve got a jquery plugin called 'a' and i want to initialize it on a div element which is in a variable called 'div'. How can I call 'a' on 'div'?
[16:22:30] <Velveeta> instead, create helper functions to test that logic for you, and reference those functions from your template, don't embed the logic directly into your template
[16:23:24] <dwarder> Velveeta: i see, so it is smarty
[16:23:26] <Velveeta> saganbyte: how do you normally invoke a? does it expect 'this' scope to reference the div element, like a $.fn function would typically, or does it expect to receive div as a parameter, like a $ function would?
[16:23:26] <dwarder> Velveeta: :)
[16:23:32] <Velveeta> dwarder: i guess so :D
[16:23:43] <saganbyte> Velveeta: yes that s right
[16:23:56] <Velveeta> saganbyte: those were options :D
[16:23:57] <saganbyte> Velveeta: I d call it like this $('div').a()
[16:24:02] <nafta> oh mygod..I can't seem to make this work
[16:24:16] <Velveeta> ok, but instead you want to use a div variable reference to invoke it?
[16:24:24] <saganbyte> Velveeta: :D I meant it does use this as a scope to reference
[16:24:32] <saganbyte> Velveeta: 'this'
[16:24:39] <dwarder> Velveeta: so you have created helpers for "for loop" and "if" , right?
[16:25:05] <Velveeta> is div a raw dom node reference, or is it a jquery version of that, as in, is div == document.getElementById('someDiv') or is div == $('#someDiv') ?
[16:25:10] <dwarder> Velveeta: this is what needed often
[16:25:20] <saganbyte> Velveeta: var pluginName = 'a'; var div = 'div'; // I d like to evalutate that to $('div').a() without having to use eval()
[16:25:29] <Velveeta> oh ok
[16:25:31] <dwarder> Velveeta: to iterate over your json
[16:25:41] <dwarder> for example
[16:25:46] <Velveeta> so if div is a string representation of the literal tag name 'div' you can just say $(div).a()
[16:25:46] <doug65536> saganbyte: use square brackets
[16:26:05] <doug65536> saganbyte: $('div')[pluginName]()
[16:26:22] <saganbyte> doug65536: 'div' is in a var too
[16:26:22] <Velveeta> dwarder: there are built in helpers for for loops and if statements, handlebars isn't completely logic less, just mostly logicless
[16:26:31] <ElysiumNet> Question: Is there any way to override default browser behaviour regarding shortcuts, but to continue bubbling up to the keypress event?
[16:26:41] <saganbyte> doug65536: i ve tried square brackets already :(
[16:26:43] <Velveeta> $(divVarName)[pluginName]()
[16:26:46] <dwarder> Velveeta: haha i see, thank you
[16:26:50] <ElysiumNet> the reason I want to do this is because keypress can actually tell me what character I intended to press
[16:27:05] <Velveeta> dwarder: there are a few tutorials out there that'll demonstrate that kind of stuff, let me dig up a link real quick to the first one
[16:27:05] <doug65536> saganbyte: ok, I know a way that will definitely work
[16:27:19] <saganbyte> doug65536: cool :)
[16:27:35] <Velveeta> elysium: have you tried e.preventDefault() ? i don't know that it'll work for keyboard shortcuts or not
[16:27:50] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: the problem is that that will prevent default browser behaviour
[16:28:00] <doug65536> saganbyte: $.fn[pluginName].apply($(divVarName), [])
[16:28:03] <Velveeta> are you talking about using something like cmd-f or alt-f as a shortcut key, without it executing e.g. a file menu being opened?
[16:28:07] <ElysiumNet> the default browser behaviour would be keydown -> keyup -> keypress
[16:28:16] <saganbyte> doug65536: very interesting, i ll try that
[16:28:20] <grafi> very hip doug65536
[16:28:27] <ElysiumNet> preventing default browser behaviour will prevent keyup and keypress from being called
[16:28:46] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: and yes
[16:29:18] <Velveeta> hmmm, interesting question, i'm a) not sure if you can prevent default actions on shortcuts that are meant for the application level vs the web page level
[16:29:21] <nafta> well grafi...nothing..I couldn't do it
[16:29:40] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: I can on keydown
[16:29:43] <JimmyXander> OMG I'M GETTING AN ANNOYING ERROR IDK WHAT IT MEANS!
[16:29:47] <Velveeta> gotcha
[16:29:48] <ElysiumNet> but it will prevent bubbling up to keyup and keypress
[16:29:48] <grafi> why not nafta ?
[16:29:56] <nafta> I don't know..
[16:30:02] <nafta> look at this
[16:30:02] <nafta> http://pastebin.com/MWSxhs0Y
[16:30:02] <ElysiumNet> and I cannot prevent default browser behaviour regarding shortcuts in keyup and keypress
[16:30:04] <Velveeta> what if you kill it on keydown, and manually trigger keyup and key press?
[16:30:21] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: it doesn't seem to be properly forwarding the event information
[16:30:39] <grafi> whats up with that nafta ?
[16:30:50] <ElysiumNet> the thing with keypress is that it will know what character I intended, while keyup and keydown only know what keycode I pressed
[16:30:52] <nafta> grafi..that I don't see anything wrong in there..it should work
[16:30:53] <nafta> :(
[16:31:13] <Velveeta> something like keyDownHandler = function (e) { e.preventDefault(); var keyUp = $.Event(e); keyUp.type = 'keyup'; var keyPress = $.Event(e); keyPress.type = 'key press'; $(this).trigger(keyUp); $(this).trigger(keyPress); }; ?
[16:31:20] <grafi> seems to me like you are still never actually calling populate banks, no?
[16:31:26] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[16:31:46] <nafta> grafi..where should I call it?
[16:31:53] <JimmyXander> pls help. http://jsfiddle.net/wxrhU/ This won't run right is jsfiddle I'm calling the .load function but this is the error I'm getting. (Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: # )
[16:32:06] <grafi> gotcha
[16:32:14] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: I haven't tried it like that
[16:32:19] <ElysiumNet> but that doesn't seem to be doing anything either
[16:32:20] <Velveeta> jimmy: $('#' + ' .preloader')
[16:32:33] <JimmyXander> ah
[16:32:33] <Velveeta> my guess is you're missing 'set' in that concatenation
[16:32:34] <JimmyXander> ty
[16:32:37] <Velveeta> which you have in the other lines
[16:32:38] <ElysiumNet> yeah, same result as just calling $(this).keypress();
[16:32:38] <nafta> like..how do you suggest that I call it grafi?
[16:32:39] <Velveeta> np
[16:32:44] <JimmyXander> it was driving me NUTS
[16:33:13] <grafi> nafta http://pastebin.com/yH5q8MQ4
[16:33:23] <Velveeta> elysium: hmmmmm, you can try creating a generic $.Event('keyup'); event object, and then looping through e's properties and manually setting them all (except type) on the new object and triggering that maybe
[16:33:37] <grafi> you will probably have to adjust the banks.php url for the example thats online
[16:33:44] <Velveeta> ok, now i have to migrate home or my wife will kill me
[16:33:48] <saganbyte> doug65536: I get 'Cannot call method apply of undefined' :( I ve created a pastebin with my test code, http://pastebin.com/2Gfh4qTU I d really appreciate if you could take a look...
[16:33:53] <Velveeta> so elysium: i'm out of ideas after that, but good luck :)
[16:34:07] <saganbyte> doug65536: I ve defined plugins in this format for this test $.fn.a = function() { this.html( 'a' ); };
[16:34:11] <grafi> its something like /blot/banks.php if i remember correctly
[16:34:17] <ElysiumNet> I've had this working up to a point, but the library I was using was limited to a latin alphabeth :(
[16:34:17] <saganbyte> doug65536: that s inside a file called  a.js
[16:34:37] <ElysiumNet> and it relied on keyup/keydown rather than keypress
[16:34:52] <nafta> grafi I get a ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:35:04] <Velveeta> saganbyte: try console.logging $.fn[pluginName], because it doesn't seem to be set in your $.fn namespace
[16:35:10] <grafi> use jQuery instead
[16:35:20] <saganbyte> Velveeta: alright
[16:35:32] <Velveeta> ok, now i really must away, but will be back on later
[16:35:41] <Velveeta> my first day helping in here was fun :D
[16:35:42] <JimmyXander> Velveeta weren't you the one who tried to help me last night?
[16:35:51] <saganbyte> Velveeta: you re right, i m getting 'undefined' on logging it
[16:35:53] <doug65536> saganbyte: where is the code that puts in the plugins?
[16:35:55] <Velveeta> jimmy: possibly, i was in here briefly last night
[16:36:10] <JimmyXander> were you the one who told me to research deferred objects?
[16:36:11] <Velveeta> i never thought about sitting in this room until the jquery convention here for the last 2 days
[16:36:13] <grafi> nafta i see you include your jquery in the bottom of the page, so move the script tag down there too
[16:36:15] <saganbyte> doug65536: its adding the script tags dynamically
[16:36:20] <Velveeta> when it was recommended to jump in and help if you were interested in contributing
[16:36:24] <saganbyte> doug65536: i ll try by static adding them
[16:36:25] <Velveeta> well, here and in the -dev channels
[16:36:50] <grafi> good on you Velveeta :)
[16:36:55] <ElysiumNet> screw it, I'll just change my shortcuts
[16:36:58] <Velveeta> saganbyte: yeah if you're adding script tags dynamically, those injections fire asynchronously, so you may be dealing with a race condition
[16:37:08] <ElysiumNet> eventually someone will volunteer to fix it
[16:37:12] <doug65536> saganbyte: in each onload you do them all?
[16:37:15] <ElysiumNet> right?
[16:37:15] <Velveeta> there ya go :)
[16:37:30] <Velveeta> ok i'll be back!
[16:37:34] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: are you texting on the road?
[16:37:34] <ElysiumNet> ah
[16:37:36] <doug65536> saganbyte: line 40
[16:37:45] <Velveeta> elysium: nah, i still have yet to leave my desk at work :D
[16:38:02] <Velveeta> i have a release on our internal product due monday, and i have had 0 time to work on it in the last couple of weeks
[16:38:17] <nafta> grafi it works...but it won't populate the select...this is so weird.
[16:38:27] <nafta> I mean in the console...the error dissapeared
[16:38:31] <Velveeta> i presented at the jquery convention here the other day, so most of the run up time was spent practicing my presentation and working on unit tests for our own library, with no actual feature development
[16:38:38] <Velveeta> and today was entirely meetings and sitting in here :D
[16:38:44] <saganbyte> doug65536: i m adding a script tag there and on load of that script tag i m trying to apply the plugin to the appropriate div(s)
[16:38:50] <doug65536> saganbyte: you have a bug on line 39
[16:38:58] <nafta> grafi in Response at the console I get [{"bank_id":"1","name":"Bank Jacob Safra"},{"bank_id":"2","name":"Pershing"},{"bank_id":"3","name":"Credit Suisse"},{"bank_id":"4","name":"Goldman Sachs"},{"bank_id":"5","name":"Julius Baer"}]
[16:39:05] <doug65536> saganbyte: where is the p inside the function parens: ---> function(p) {
[16:39:07] <nafta> same on HTML
[16:39:20] <saganbyte> doug65536: ah!
[16:39:35] <grafi> i dont see it online :o
[16:39:37] <grafi> :P
[16:39:54] <nafta> oh..I don't have it online, let me upload this file
[16:39:57] <nafta> only one file
[16:39:58] <nafta> hehe
[16:40:12] <grafi> :)
[16:41:38] <nafta> grafi http://www.fostnet.net/blot/transaction2.php
[16:42:03] <doug65536> saganbyte: actually, I think you need one more nesting to properly capture the p
[16:42:36] <doug65536> saganbyte: fileref.onload = (function(p) { return function() {
[16:42:42] <doug65536> and one more closing }
[16:43:48] <grafi> nafta I think i copy pasted wrong selectors ^^
[16:44:15] <doug65536> saganbyte: yes, definitely
[16:44:28] <nafta> grafi oh I hope is that
[16:44:29] <nafta> haha
[16:44:32] <grafi> $("select.bancos") should of course be $('#select01') in the $.each nafta
[16:44:37] <saganbyte> doug65536: i tried that. before and after trying that i m getting $ is not defined.
[16:44:47] <saganbyte> doug65536: maybe my sample plugins are not defined correctly?
[16:44:57] <doug65536> saganbyte: can you show one?
[16:44:58] <grafi> also the chosen plugin stuff is back ^^
[16:45:03] <grafi> nafta ^
[16:45:04] <saganbyte> doug65536: this is how i m definging them $.fn.a = function() { this.html( 'a' ); };
[16:45:39] <nafta> grafi lemme comment it out
[16:45:43] <grafi> k
[16:45:50] <doug65536> saganbyte: well that is not an entirely correct plugin. it will break if the user of jquery uses noConflict
[16:46:15] <grafi> function()()()()
[16:46:33] <saganbyte> doug65536: i m just using that style for this sample
[16:47:24] <nafta> grafi! IT WORKS!
[16:47:28] <nafta> it is ugly but it WORKS!
[16:47:35] <grafi> :P
[16:47:55] <saganbyte> doug65536: i m sorry that was happening coz i had statically defined the plugins a min ago
[16:48:03] <nafta> haha..now I have to create a second drop down that depends on the data of the first dropdown
[16:48:04] <nafta> haha
[16:48:05] <saganbyte> doug65536: i think it s about to work
[16:48:12] <nafta> thanks a lot bro
[16:48:56] <grafi> np
[16:48:59] <saganbyte> doug65536: it worked!!! thank you so much!
[16:49:04] <saganbyte> doug65536: sincerely :)
[16:49:07] <doug65536> saganbyte: np
[16:49:12] <grafi> yeah doug65536 you are the man
[16:49:40] <grafi> http://cutestuff.co/2012/06/this-kitten-loves-you-this-much/
[16:49:51] <JimmyXander> in this instance, would it be better to pass the "loadset" function an array, instead of individual strings?
[16:49:54] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/wxrhU/1/
[16:51:08] <grafi> cruel
[16:51:17] <JimmyXander> cruel?
[16:51:32] <grafi> cruel cruel cruel
[16:51:36] <JimmyXander> what is?
[16:52:14] <grafi> your christmas tree
[16:52:43] <JimmyXander> okay okay yeah, BUT, I don't know how else to make sure each function triggers after the previous one is complete
[16:52:48] <ElysiumNet> ugh, I've been going at this keydown/keypress for ages now
[16:53:00] <grafi> yeah
[16:53:22] <ElysiumNet> let's say I want to override ctrl+f, but I also want to know when I attempt to use a question mark... what would be the best way to go about this?
[16:53:51] <grafi> how are those 2 related oÃ´
[16:54:03] <JimmyXander> inorite?
[16:54:17] <ElysiumNet> grafi: ctrl+f is easily overrided in keydown. the questionmark is not so much easily distinguished in keydown, but it is in keypress
[16:54:30] <ElysiumNet> however I need to override in keydown so the default browser behaviour does not kick in
[16:54:38] <JimmyXander> can you guys get into the php channel?
[16:54:43] <JimmyXander> I can't seem to get in
[16:54:55] <ElysiumNet> JimmyXander: you need to be authenticated
[16:54:59] <JimmyXander> I am
[16:55:01] <ElysiumNet> it's also ##php
[16:55:35] <JimmyXander> how do I Reidentify?
[16:55:46] <ElysiumNet> JimmyXander: by normally identifying
[16:55:58] <JimmyXander> no idea whatcha mean there mate
[16:56:01] <JimmyXander> =/
[16:56:13] <JimmyXander> not an irc regualr
[16:56:47] <doug65536> JimmyXander: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#identify
[16:58:01] <doug65536> JimmyXander: and if you haven't done it yet: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#userregistration
[17:00:22] <grafi> im inside ##php
[17:00:26] <grafi> its not worth it :P
[17:00:32] <doug65536> lol
[17:00:44] <grafi> would you say otherwise doug65536 ?
[17:00:50] <doug65536> no
[17:01:56] <nesoi> does anyone here know how to scroll to the bottom of a scrolling region? I see a lot about how to scroll down n pixels, but I have no idea how long the region is and just need to scroll to the bottom of it.
[17:02:14] <doug65536> I can't remember once getting a legitimate reply to something in ##php
[17:02:57] <nesoi> hi doug65536
[17:03:00] <doug65536> nesoi: .prop('scrollHeight') should return it
[17:03:45] <doug65536> nesoi: hi
[17:04:22] <JimmyXander> get the scroll height and scroll to it - the height
[17:05:20] <doug65536> nesoi: $(something).scrollTop($(something).prop('scrollHeight'));    <-- that should do it
[17:05:43] <nesoi> so something like $('#div1').scrollTop($('#div1').prop("scrollHeight")); ?
[17:05:50] <doug65536> yes
[17:05:57] <nesoi> cool, thanks!
[17:19:25] <JimmyXander> anyone know how to reset a password?
[17:21:40] <JimmyXander> nvm I remembered my password
[17:21:41] <JimmyXander> thnx!
[17:22:03] <doug65536> JimmyXander: I never remember, they pretend you can't but SENDPASS or something works :)
[17:22:11] <doug65536> EMAILPASS?
[17:22:14] <doug65536> something like that
[17:22:45] <JimmyXander> thnks
[17:23:48] <aMoniker> How can I tell if a given element has a tooltip applied?
[17:24:16] <ElysiumNet> when did this turn into #help ?
[17:24:17] <aMoniker> calling $element.tooltip('foo'); if one hasn't been applied already stops my script from running
[17:24:44] <aMoniker> ElysiumNet: Talking to me?
[17:25:06] <doug65536> look out guys, we got a topic cop here
[17:25:10] <JimmyXander> no he's talking to me
[17:25:18] <JimmyXander> Fair enough ElysiumNet
[17:25:32] * JimmyXander bows his head in deep shame.
[17:25:33] <ElysiumNet> aMoniker: no
[17:26:14] <JimmyXander> BUT, to my defense, no one was terribly busy answering any jQuery related questions so...
[17:26:37] <aMoniker> I want to remove a tooltip if one has been applied... but $el.tooltip('destroy'); stops the script if a tooltip hasn't been initialized for that element.
[17:26:48] <ElysiumNet> JimmyXander: what jquery question?
[17:27:06] <ElysiumNet> aMoniker: tooltip? is this jquery UI?
[17:27:06] <JimmyXander> ElysiumNet: Exactly
[17:27:20] <aMoniker> ElysiumNet: Yes.
[17:27:26] <ElysiumNet> JimmyXander: it got drowned out by your irc questions :P
[17:27:32] <ElysiumNet> aMoniker: I think we have a #jqueryui channel
[17:27:40] <JimmyXander> ElysiumNet: Damnit, fair enough.
[17:27:44] * JimmyXander cries in the corner
[17:27:46] <aMoniker> ElysiumNet: It's in the topic
[17:27:52] <aMoniker> ElysiumNet: Do you know though?
[17:27:58] <ElysiumNet> no, I avoid jqueryUI
[17:28:12] <aMoniker> What do you use instead?
[17:28:31] <ElysiumNet> I usually write it myself
[17:28:41] <aMoniker> also, just from guessing in the console... it appears $el.data('tooltip') will indicate the state :)
[17:28:47] <aMoniker> ElysiumNet: Wow, you've got lots of time on your hands.
[17:29:04] <ElysiumNet> no, I just write what I need
[17:29:08] <ElysiumNet> 30-60 minutes tops
[17:29:20] <aMoniker> Small projects then.
[17:29:25] <ElysiumNet> large projects
[17:29:44] <aMoniker> Link?
[17:29:49] <ElysiumNet> NDA
[17:29:51] <aMoniker> uh huh
[17:29:54] <aMoniker> ok later!
[17:29:58] <ElysiumNet> pff :/
[17:30:50] <doug65536> I add topic cops to my ignore list
[17:31:06] * JimmyXander stops crying
[17:31:13] * JimmyXander breaks into dance
[17:37:50] <nesoi> hey doug65536 that scroll command isn't working. What would you try?
[17:38:10] <doug65536> nesoi: what is it? a div with overflow: scroll?
[17:39:46] <nesoi> it's a jq mobile page with a scrolling listview
[17:40:22] <JimmyXander> you know what's ironic? On an iPhone, it takes 13 keystrokes to write: 1 - 2 - 3
[17:40:49] <Velveeta> i remember that line from that alanis song
[17:42:04] <grafi> its like raaaaaaaaain
[17:42:27] <tw2113> for you talking about alanis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qVIbEwCgC4
[17:42:58] <Velveeta> damn, i can't watch that with volume right now because the wife is watching the master chef finale, but i'll save it for later :)
[17:43:32] <doug65536> nesoi: do $('#div1').prop("scrollHeight") in the console
[17:43:49] <tw2113> your wife should hear it too, tell her to pause the tv
[17:44:18] <tw2113> it's worth it imho
[17:44:22] <Velveeta> i can't, i already told her to pause it once so i could catch her up on some photoshop fun that went out via work email earlier :D
[17:44:35] <Velveeta> but maybe i'll watch it during a commercial
[17:46:08] <nesoi> doug65536:  there's not console. it's on a phone
[17:46:14] <nesoi> I did this though http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/
[17:47:31] <dwarder> who is john doe?
[17:47:39] <dwarder> is it like a foo bar baz?
[17:47:41] <nesoi> or http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/1/
[17:50:05] <nesoi> doug65536:  should I be using overflow scroll?
[17:50:49] <doug65536> what is it that you are trying to scroll? the page?
[17:51:04] <nesoi> No, check out that fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/1/
[17:51:11] <nesoi> just the area with the balloons
[17:52:38] <nesoi> or http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/2/ even
[17:57:57] <nesoi> doug65536:  rather http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/3/
[17:58:06] <doug65536> nesoi: it can't scroll unless it is overflow scroll afaik
[17:58:21] <doug65536> or you have a div inside it and move it up and down
[17:58:31] <doug65536> and make the outer one overflow hidden
[17:58:36] <doug65536> but then it won't have a scrollbar
[17:58:48] <nesoi> I mean http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/4/
[17:59:03] <nesoi> hmâ€¦ that's odd
[17:59:08] <nesoi> it does scroll on the phone
[17:59:13] <nesoi> just not automatically to the bottom
[18:06:20] <doug65536> nesoi: sorry I'm in a call...
[18:06:27] <doug65536> I'll be back in a bit
[18:06:48] <nesoi> np, thanks doug65536
[18:07:08] <Velveeta> maybe i can take over where he left off, what are you trying to accomplish there?
[18:07:57] <nesoi> hey Velveeta
[18:08:19] <Velveeta> hey there
[18:08:27] <nesoi> this fiddle is like what I have, but for some reason in chrome it doesn't  scroll as it does on the phone http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/5/
[18:08:38] <nesoi> I'm trying to make it scroll to the bottom when it's displayed
[18:08:47] <nesoi> but the code I'm using doesn't do anything
[18:08:51] <nesoi> wait 1 correction before you look
[18:09:15] <nesoi> http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/6/
[18:10:12] <Velveeta> taking a look now
[18:10:17] <nesoi> thanks Velveeta!
[18:10:26] <Velveeta> don't thank me yet :D
[18:14:50] <nesoi> hm. I think I figgred it out actually
[18:14:58] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[18:15:19] <nesoi> although it doesn't work in the fiddle
[18:15:25] <Velveeta> so in my dom inspector, your #cEventView element didn't seem to have any height, so i was looking into that at first
[18:15:31] <nesoi> $.mobile.silentScroll($('#div1').prop("scrollHeight"));
[18:15:37] <Velveeta> but trying to drill my way down into the iframe to get to it first
[18:15:56] <nesoi> yeah, I think it's a bug somewhere
[18:16:13] <nesoi> but that seemed to work
[18:16:36] <Velveeta> well that's good to hear
[18:16:46] <nesoi> now I have another problem :(
[18:16:47] <nesoi> :)
[18:17:04] <Velveeta> bring it on :)
[18:17:43] <nesoi> heh
[18:17:55] <nesoi> it's the same setup though so I don't know how to show it
[18:18:24] <nesoi> the problem is: what I pasted scrolls to the bottom
[18:18:38] <nesoi> but if I have a div with only 1 or 2 messages in it, they scroll right off the screen
[18:18:58] <nesoi> because somehow the div includes a bunch of empty space under it
[18:19:18] <nesoi> how would I eliminate that? It only seems to be the case if there isn't a screen  full of messages
[18:20:13] <Velveeta> hmmmm, you could try calculating the height of the individual bubbles to set the scrollTop, but that'd be more expensive than your current solution
[18:20:34] <Velveeta> let me brainstorm for a minute
[18:22:39] <Technical_13> How can I get a count of how many times an indexOf is matched on a page?
[18:23:29] <Velveeta> nesoi: i'm drawing a blank on why you have empty space there
[18:23:41] <Velveeta> technical: what do you mean by matching an indexOf?
[18:24:00] <Technical_13> I know .firstIndexOf() and .lastIndexOf()  how do I get a count of how many are in the middle?
[18:24:06] <nesoi> hmm
[18:24:29] <nesoi> could I detect the bottom of the last <li> and set the div length to that?
[18:24:35] <nesoi> Velveeta
[18:24:41] <Velveeta> you could run a regular expression to get all matches, and then subtract 2 from it
[18:25:10] <Technical_13> So .match(/FooBar/I) ?
[18:25:11] <Velveeta> nesoi: you can try that
[18:25:18] <nesoi> how would I do that though? :)
[18:25:27] <Technical_13> So .match(/FooBar/i).length-2 ?
[18:25:33] <Velveeta> technical: /g to get all matches
[18:25:42] <doug65536> nesoi: so what did you do? put that top and bottom thing fixed or something?
[18:25:58] <nesoi> $.mobile.silentScroll($('#div1').prop("scrollHeight"));
[18:26:01] <doug65536> nesoi: why screw around? make it a div and put overflow scroll on it
[18:26:01] <Velveeta> yeah, that sounds about right, if you're only concerned about the number of internal matches vs the locations
[18:26:19] <doug65536> nesoi: have fun pounding a round peg into a square hole
[18:26:22] <nesoi> doug65536:  apparently overflow scroll only works on andriod 4 or above
[18:26:32] <Velveeta> does overflow auto work?
[18:26:41] <Technical_13> I have a script that is suppose to add an item to a list and drop the bottom item.
[18:26:45] <doug65536> then make it a div and move it
[18:26:51] <nesoi> I don't think so Velveeta
[18:27:34] <Technical_13> Someone blanked the page on me (on a wiki) and I realizes it shouldn't drop the bottom if the list isn't at 10 items
[18:27:34] <Velveeta> when you say a list, do you mean like a ul/ol, or like a comma-separated string list?
[18:27:39] <nesoi> what's odd is that since adding that $.mobile.silentScroll, there's a screen flash of the listview when leaving that screen
[18:27:44] <Technical_13> Neither
[18:28:10] <doug65536> nesoi: so if overflow scroll doesn't work, why are you even talking about scrolling it
[18:28:18] <Technical_13> \n delimited list
[18:28:19] <nesoi> doug65536:  the thing is, it scrolls without the overvlow scroll
[18:28:27] <nesoi> it doesn't work in chrome, but it works on the phone
[18:28:29] <doug65536> nesoi: what is "it"
[18:28:39] <nesoi> scrolling
[18:28:50] <doug65536> what scrolls
[18:28:59] <nesoi> the area with the message bubbles.
[18:29:00] <tw2113> I want to grab the ID of a clicked element. If i do el = $(this), should I need to dig in to el.context.id ? or is there a shorter path with the el object I can use?
[18:29:09] <doug65536> what is the area with the message bubbles
[18:29:21] <nesoi> http://jsfiddle.net/EjATB/8/
[18:29:50] <Velveeta> technical: you could also split that string on \n, check the length, and pop the last value, then join("\n")
[18:29:51] <doug65536> nesoi: that page has invalid html
[18:30:08] <doug65536> nesoi: children of ul must be li
[18:30:17] <Velveeta> tw2113: this.id should work
[18:30:40] <tw2113> instead of wrapping it in $() ?
[18:30:41] <raj> how can I unset the js assigned css using .css()? I want the actual css stylesheet to be used again
[18:30:42] <Velveeta> this should be a reference to the dom node itself, which you can directly reference the id property of
[18:30:46] <Velveeta> right
[18:30:55] <doug65536> nesoi: what I think is the page gets a scrollbar and you're scrolling the page
[18:31:14] <nesoi> doug65536: I have to do that to make the bubble work
[18:31:20] <nesoi> otherwise it doesn't display properly
[18:31:25] <nesoi> maybe there's a better way to do it?
[18:31:34] <tw2113> awesome, i'm game for less characters
[18:31:37] <tw2113> thanks Velveeta
[18:31:42] <Velveeta> raj: i don't think there's a way to revert custom styles applied via js automatically, you'd have to know what you applied and undo itâ€¦ i *think*
[18:31:51] <nesoi> yes I think so too doug65536 but it doesn't have a scrollbar there
[18:32:00] <Velveeta> tw: no problemo
[18:32:03] <Technical_13> Velveeta: I'm not that familiar with .split() & .pop()
[18:32:26] <nesoi> (in chrome)
[18:32:30] <nesoi> or rather in jsfiddle
[18:32:32] <Velveeta> technical: split is like php's explode, just blows a string up into an array based on a delimiter character
[18:32:37] <tw2113> i don'ce care much for using jQuery to set css
[18:32:42] <Velveeta> pop will pop the last value off of that array
[18:32:44] <tw2113> i'd much rather use it to toggle classes
[18:32:58] <Velveeta> the join will rejoin that array into a string with a delimiter character you provide
[18:33:21] <Velveeta> tw makes a good point
[18:33:32] <nesoi> is there a way to scroll to the the bottom of the last element, rather than the bottom of the div?
[18:33:40] <raj> Velveeta, that includes setting it equal to an empty string, right?
[18:33:54] <doug65536> nesoi: what is 20px / 10px supposed to do in the css?
[18:34:11] <nesoi> where's that doug65536?
[18:34:28] <Technical_13> I'll try it both ways in a fiddle.. thanks Velveeta
[18:34:37] <doug65536> nesoi: .bubble
[18:35:01] <nesoi> dunno, I didn't write the bubble css. Just found it online
[18:35:04] <Velveeta> raj: i believe so, because you're acting on the computed style set, which includes css properties, so setting to an empty string will blank out that computed set rather than falling back to the css value
[18:35:15] <Velveeta> oh, here's an idea
[18:35:26] <doug65536> nesoi: all that before after junk is totally unnecessary
[18:35:26] <Velveeta> .removeAttr('style') @raj
[18:35:37] <Velveeta> .css just applies those values as inline styles
[18:35:40] <nesoi> how do I find the position of the bottom of the last <li>?
[18:35:50] <Velveeta> removing the style attribute should force it to fall back to css
[18:36:07] <Velveeta> technical: good luck
[18:37:39] <doug65536> I wouldn't recommend nuking the entire style attribute
[18:38:00] <doug65536> .css({property: ''}) will restore a single thing to normal
[18:38:29] <Velveeta> but i think he's wanting to nuke all element-level styles and revert to just the css stylings
[18:38:40] <raj> Velveeta, very smart!
[18:38:41] <raj> thank you!
[18:38:55] <doug65536> ok, what he want's is not advisable - it's an awful hack
[18:39:14] <Velveeta> yeah doug's right about the individual property thing, i was thinking wrong when i said you were working on the computed style set
[18:39:54] <doug65536> hides shows fades animates slides etc, all rely on stable style attributes
[18:40:38] <Velveeta> so do you have a suggestion for how to programmatically determine what all to zero out at the element level?
[18:40:51] <Velveeta> just grab the style attribute and regex the properties out?
[18:41:02] <Velveeta> or is there something i'm not thinking of
[18:41:08] <duch_kazatel> why are you setting the style attribute for that in the first place?
[18:41:15] <duch_kazatel> make a class and apply/remove that class as needed.
[18:41:36] <Velveeta> duch: yeah, someone already mentioned class swapping a few minutes ago, which is definitely safer
[18:42:06] <duch_kazatel> and preferred.  editing the style attribute is asking for pain.  if you're mucking with more than 1 property, do a class.
[18:42:24] <Velveeta> although sometimes it's much easier to do something like, programmatically setting the top or left offset of something in relation to something else, which you can't necessarily known in advance to create a css class out of
[18:42:54] <duch_kazatel> sure, a single property "fix" like that is safe, but avoid it where possible.
[18:43:00] <Velveeta> rightio
[18:46:26] <nesoi1> oops
[18:46:35] <nesoi1> I was just askingâ€¦
[18:46:37] <Velveeta> you blowed it up?
[18:46:42] <nesoi1> so how would I find the position within the div of the bottom of the last <li>?
[18:46:51] <nesoi1> .position?
[18:46:55] <nesoi1> I guess
[18:47:28] <duch_kazatel> the position css property?
[18:47:31] <Velveeta> .position().top + element.outerHeight()
[18:51:23] <doug65536> nesoi1: $('li').last().position().top
[18:51:55] <Velveeta> oh whoops, i misread that, i thought you wanted the bottom of the last div
[18:52:53] <doug65536> oh yeah, forgot to add height
[18:53:23] <Velveeta> well it depends on if he just wants the position of it or the bottom of it
[18:53:35] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i guess he did say the bottom of it
[18:53:38] <nesoi1> the bottom of the last li
[18:53:53] <doug65536> he probably wants to get the size of the viewport and subtract the height of that to get desired scroll offset
[18:54:00] <Velveeta> so yeah, what he said, plus height.. if there's border involved, you want outerHeight()
[18:54:05] <doug65536> nesoi1: lol I'm talking in 3rd person a lot tonight
[18:54:49] <nesoi1> my thought was to see whether the last position is longer than the available scrolling area on the screen
[18:54:52] <nesoi1> and if it's not, don't scroll
[18:55:30] <nesoi1> this goes back to a different problem which is that I can't get the messages to display starting from the bottom
[18:56:50] <doug65536> nesoi1: I removed that mess of before after content stuff in the css. and fixed the invalid html: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EjATB/11/
[18:58:37] <nesoi1> thanks doug65536. what did you actually change?
[18:58:58] <nesoi1> the bubbles no longer have directional triangles...
[18:59:22] <doug65536> yeah, that is a problem
[18:59:40] <doug65536> I'm sure it is one that can be solved without invalid html
[18:59:48] <nesoi1> oops I just got an urgent call and have to run
[18:59:51] <nesoi1> thanks for the help!
[18:59:53] <nesoi1> ttyl
[19:01:02] <doug65536> I wonder if browsers will implement dithering someday
[19:01:19] <doug65536> gradients have heavy banding look like crap in all browsers
[19:01:36] <doug65536> when the color change is small
[19:02:07] <Velveeta> yeah i think we're looking to drop gradients altogether in our products
[19:03:32] <otiuk> what's the best way to count the amount of elements with a certain class within a certain div... i'm trying to use $('#div_id .classtocount').length .. but it seems to be counting all the classes on the page not just the ones within that particular div
[19:04:01] <doug65536> otiuk: that should work. perhaps you have invalid html (unbalanced tags)
[19:04:21] <Velveeta> what do you get if you output $('#div_id').length ?
[19:04:33] <otiuk> ya i'm going thru all that now.. just wanted to make sure
[19:04:42] <otiuk> Velveeta: the count for all of them on page
[19:05:03] <Velveeta> i mean without the .classtocount
[19:06:18] <otiuk> Velveeta: just 1 .. which is good
[19:06:29] <shoky> $('#any_id').length will always be 0 or 1
[19:06:38] <doug65536> otiuk: what number do you expect, and what number do you get?
[19:07:07] <otiuk> there are 8 on the page.. and and it should be returning 5 within that specific div
[19:07:08] <Velveeta> shoky: oh yeah, good point, even with multiple instances it'll just return the first one
[19:08:12] <doug65536> otiuk: you're using this right? http://validator.w3.org/
[19:08:18] <Velveeta> otiuk: what happens if you try chaining those selectors like $('#div_id').find('.classtocount').length ?
[19:08:37] <shoky> `demo
[19:08:38] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:08:53] <tw2113> js is so handy
[19:09:51] <shoky> innit
[19:10:17] <doug65536> otiuk: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7y7ks/
[19:11:25] <doug65536> otiuk: you don't have any nesting involved that you haven't mentioned, do you?
[19:11:28] <tw2113> shoky, i have a good one for you
[19:12:17] <tw2113> would i be able to succeed in making a variable out of the property of one object, and then use that variable as a property reference in a different object?
[19:12:19] <shoky> i'm falling asleep, i might drool all over it
[19:12:45] <tw2113> var foo = bar.val;
[19:12:50] <doug65536> tw2113: what type is it?
[19:13:01] <shoky> didn't understand the 2nd half of the question
[19:13:03] <tw2113> bar.foo.length //1
[19:13:34] <tw2113> as short as can be, i have 2 objects being passed into a function
[19:13:54] <doug65536> tw2113: objects are by reference
[19:14:13] <tw2113> one holds a value of what was selected, the other holds properties of all sorts regarding the file that was selected
[19:14:27] <tw2113> lots of image data
[19:14:39] <Velveeta> so, example: bar.foo == 'myProperty', and foo.myProperty = someValue
[19:14:39] <shoky> "use that variable as a property reference"    que?
[19:14:40] <Velveeta> ?
[19:14:56] <Velveeta> and you want to know if you can use the value 'myProperty' to reference the myProperty property on the other object?
[19:15:18] <tw2113> yeah
[19:15:22] <Velveeta> totally
[19:15:30] <Velveeta> use bracket notation
[19:15:34] <shoky> foo[bar.foo]  ?
[19:15:40] <Velveeta> yepyep
[19:15:42] <tw2113> so object 1 has a propery value of "thumbnail"
[19:16:09] <tw2113> object 2 has sizes { full {}, medium {} thumbnail{} }
[19:16:29] <tw2113> and inside the thumbnail property is height/width/url for that size
[19:16:29] <doug65536> js> a={ x: { test: 10 } }; b = { x: {} }; b.x = a.x; b.x.test = 20; print(a.x.test); @ tw2113
[19:16:38] <b-ot> tw2113: 20
[19:16:50] <Velveeta> tw: look at shoky's answer above
[19:16:57] <tw2113> will do
[19:17:02] <Velveeta> you don't even need a variable reference, just use the property reference itself
[19:17:16] <tw2113> *scampers off to test*
[19:17:17] <Velveeta> object2[object1.propertyName]
[19:18:46] <tw2113> eggcellent
[19:18:55] * Velveeta drums his fingers together like Mr. Burns.
[19:18:58] <tw2113> thank you fine gentlemen and ladies
[19:19:31] <Velveeta> anytime (â€¦â€¦i'm here)
[19:20:00] * shoky drool tw2113
[19:20:01] <otiuk> doug65536: ya the classes are inside of divs of that one specified div
[19:20:30] <doug65536> otiuk: so in my fiddle, the bar div is inside the foo div?
[19:21:36] <doug65536> otiuk: is it like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7y7ks/   or is bar inside foo
[19:22:57] <otiuk> doug65536: i'm going to throw it into jsfiddle so i can play with it a bit.. if i get it setup i will paste it here :)
[19:27:58] <otiuk> doug65536: i love when i put it into jsfiddle and it just works.. and not in the actual app hah.. keeps it interesting
[19:33:26] <doug65536> hey if jquery is AMD-compliant, does that mean you can use require in your own code without explicitly loading it?
[19:33:58] <Velveeta> without explicitly loading what?
[19:34:02] <Velveeta> jquery itself?
[19:34:02] <doug65536> require.js
[19:34:12] <Velveeta> oh gotcha
[19:34:40] <Velveeta> so do you mean does jquery load its own require version so that you don't have to explicitly load it yourself?
[19:35:24] <doug65536> no I mean, does it just use require.js if it is there, or does it now provide 'define' and 'require' just by loading jquery
[19:36:01] <Velveeta> i think it still requires r.js
[19:36:19] <doug65536> I just stumbled upon jquery using define and require in the source
[19:36:20] <Velveeta> or almond if you want it lighter
[19:37:08] <BillCriswell> Do you guys use require.js?
[19:37:11] <Velveeta> so we have and wrappers on our internal widgets, which check for the existence of define, and use it if present, otherwise fall back to a factory method
[19:37:20] <Velveeta> is it something like that maybe?
[19:37:39] <Velveeta> bill: we do in some of our products, but not allâ€¦â€¦â€¦yet
[19:37:42] <doug65536> BillCriswell: I'm trying to start using it, instead of making a global and plugging everything into that
[19:37:56] <Velveeta> it's beautiful
[19:38:25] <Velveeta> once i started writing backbone modules and bundling them w/ require, it opened up a whole new world for me
[19:38:36] <BillCriswell> doug65536: That's what I do, haven't looked into using require that much.
[19:38:48] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: You're aiming to do it everywhere?
[19:39:18] <Velveeta> well it depends on the nature of the app, we have some single page apps that do just use require to bundle up all of its dependencies
[19:39:24] <BillCriswell> Everything I read about mobile performance leads me to think just concatenating the files is a safer bet. Haven't run too many tests.
[19:39:50] <BillCriswell> By too many I mean like... any.
[19:39:57] <Velveeta> they bundle the libs separately from the custom modules, so that as new releases are pushed out, w/ libs that have probably not changed, the cache-busting doesn't force a download of everything fresh, just the changed custom modules
[19:40:33] <BillCriswell> Ahh. That could make sense.
[19:40:50] <Velveeta> when you say safer, do you mean safer as in less buggy?
[19:41:23] <Velveeta> i've only done limited work on smartphones w/ one of our apps, but the bundled amd modules haven't caused problems for them that i've noticed
[19:41:40] <BillCriswell> I guess I mean... consistent? The latency on mobile devices can be a bitch sometimes.
[19:42:11] <Velveeta> right, for sure
[19:42:47] <Velveeta> so there you have 2 options, lazy load those modules w/ something like client side r.js, or just take that hit on the first request and rely on caching thereafter
[19:43:37] <Velveeta> i think the lazy load method would lead to more perceived latency because the setup/teardown of connections on (especially some older) cell networks is a pain in the ass, and r.js makes sure all modules are loaded before dependent code is run
[19:43:43] <doug65536> BillCriswell: require.js has a tool that scans through the source and combines modules all into one for you, by parsing the defines/requires
[19:43:47] <Velveeta> so it still has to wait for them all to load before it uses any of it
[19:44:02] <doug65536> BillCriswell: so you get the convenience without the perf hit
[19:44:10] <otiuk> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/v8yZm/1/ ... if you count the amount of "reqd" in the HTML you will count 7 but when you activate jquery's count (keyup on the first text field) you will see it counts 8
[19:44:13] <Velveeta> right, on top of that, you can minify and uglify and gzip to crunch the bytes as much as possible
[19:44:38] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Oh I thought require just kind of did what yepnope does in a way.
[19:44:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: True, true.
[19:45:10] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[19:45:13] <Velveeta> r.js can work either as a server-side or client-side process
[19:45:13] <BillCriswell> I think I'm tired.
[19:45:18] <Velveeta> i think i am too
[19:45:27] <Velveeta> we pre-build our js bundles server-side
[19:45:46] <Velveeta> and like i said, we bundle the libs separately from the custom modules we write, which are more likely to change from release to release
[19:45:53] <doug65536> BillCriswell: roughly what it does is, when you "require" something that isn't loaded, it adds a script tag to head, and in the onload event of it, it calls the callback in the require, starting execution of the code that needed that dependency
[19:47:07] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Ah, nice.  Maybe I should mess with that.
[19:47:13] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Awesome.
[19:47:49] <BillCriswell> I read this and kind of felt like it's a better bet to concat and minify: http://www.igvita.com/slides/2013/breaking-1s-mobile-barrier.pdf but I'm sure it varies on situation.
[19:47:52] <doug65536> BillCriswell: when the browser loads that dependency (that it injected into head), that code has a "define" which plugs that dependency into require, so next time it knows that it has already been loaded. that's a rough idea of how it works anyway
[19:48:07] <Velveeta> and if you use grunt as part of your development process, you can have a watch task to auto bundle your modules for you as you make changes and save, it's pretty awesome
[19:48:18] <otiuk> Velveeta: here's a portion of the code.. http://jsfiddle.net/v8yZm/1/ ... there is 7 "reqd" classes in the HTML and js is counting 8 .. you activate the count by entering a character into the first text field
[19:48:48] <Velveeta> otiuk: i'll take a look
[19:49:12] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That's what I do. I've been using codekit to do all the stuff cause I usually use a Mac. I thinkt he next gig will be using a windows machine so I started playing with Grunt.
[19:49:27] <BillCriswell> doug65536: That makes sense.
[19:49:58] <doug65536> otiuk: e_460 has some invalid option tags
[19:50:39] <BillCriswell> This pdf suggests putting some of the "header css" inline. That feels so weird to me, but his explanation makes sense.
[19:50:55] <doug65536> otiuk: the whole page is inside q_1 in the fiddle
[19:51:12] <doug65536> otiuk: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/v8yZm/2/
[19:51:52] <BillCriswell> ALF is on TV. All these years of paying for cable finally seems worth it.
[19:52:00] <doug65536> lol
[19:52:01] <Velveeta> gordon shumway?
[19:52:03] <otiuk> ya i understand that.. the thing is the count is wrong
[19:52:10] <otiuk> doug65536: ^
[19:52:26] <doug65536> BillCriswell:  squeezing the last few cents out of ALF
[19:52:36] <Velveeta> no doubt
[19:53:41] <otiuk> doug65536: & Velveeta -- the thing is if you remove jquery mobile from the external resources or basically don't load it.. it counts the right amount... but with the jquery mobile loaded it counts 8 "reqd" instead of 7
[19:53:53] <doug65536> otiuk: oh!
[19:54:03] <doug65536> otiuk: jqm screws with your html heavily
[19:54:35] <otiuk> ya i understand that.. but even in developer tools.. i'm not seeing an extra reqd anywhere
[19:55:40] <Velveeta> input.s_text_field text_field reqd ui-input-text ui-body-c, textarea.s_textarea_field textarea_field reqd ui-input-text ui-body-c ui-corner-all ui-shadow-inset, input. radio_button_field reqd, input. radio_button_field reqd, input. checkboxes_field reqd, input. checkboxes_field reqd, span.s_dropdown_list_field dropdown_list_field reqd, select.s_dropdown_list_field dropdown_list_field reqd
[19:56:00] <Velveeta> those are all the instances of read that it found, which one looks out of place?
[19:56:01] <doug65536> otiuk: in that dropdown it added a span with reqd
[19:56:05] <Velveeta> my guess is the span
[19:56:48] <otiuk> oh shit
[19:59:22] <doug65536> Is it really necessary for jqm to screw with the page so much? I doubt it
[19:59:57] <Velveeta> right, it's very opinionated
[20:00:32] <Velveeta> i had to pass on it for a mobile project of my own, i just wanted touch events, but it jacked w/ all my styling.. i dropped it and went w/ hammer.js
[20:00:33] <otiuk> doug65536: probably not.. we are liking using it as long as you don't have to do much customization..
[20:02:05] <doug65536> I would definitely like it if it didn't cause so many problems and had a more complete API for doing stuff after things are created. Whenever I see it I wonder why they didn't call it JQVI (jquery for the visually impaired) :D
[20:04:45] <Velveeta> yeah i think their thought process is to give a config to transform the bulk of sites to looking decent on mobile
[20:04:57] <Velveeta> it just comes with a lot of transformations that some sites don't need
[20:05:21] <Velveeta> they also said at the convention that most people don't take advantage of the custom builds they offer, which they'd like to see change
[20:05:44] <Velveeta> so maybe if you use the custom build process, you can escape some of the stuff it does to the dom
[20:06:56] <doug65536> Velveeta: yes, they accomplished a lot, whenever I criticize it a voice in my head reminds me that it is easier said than done
[20:07:43] <Velveeta> rightio, it probably works just fine for a lot of sites, i just didn't like those mods for my own purposes, and really only wanted it for the touch events
[20:08:04] <Velveeta> i've heard touch punch works beautifully for adding touch support also, without any jquery mobile inclusion
[20:09:11] <Velveeta> they have to plan for a lot of performance stuff that i don't ever have to worry about also, with desktops and laptops having so much more power than smartphones
[20:09:25] <doug65536> funny how youtube messes up your head... whenever someone mentions touch events, I am reminded of a video where a guy tried to smash his samsung phone with a hammer, and failed. after pounding on it for a while he got a drill and drilled a hole in the display, it continued to work!
[20:09:43] <Velveeta> lol
[20:13:14] <otiuk> Velveeta: i've used touch punch and it was good :)
[20:13:35] <Velveeta> nice
[20:13:45] <Velveeta> i haven't tried it out myself yet, just heard a good recommendation for it
[20:26:48] <Velveeta> adios, i'm out for the night, falling asleep in my chair
[20:28:59] <BillCriswell> Have a good one!
[20:29:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta ^^
[20:29:21] <BillCriswell> I always want to append "Shells & Cheese"
[20:30:25] <Velveeta> :D
[20:38:04] <BillCriswell> Thinking about selling my iPad Mini and getting one of those Kindle Paper Whites...
[20:40:41] <BillCriswell> I want to play with iOS7 on it first though. =(
[20:41:29] <bobdobbs> I've got a form stored in $("#myform"). What the cheapest way to access the submit button?
[20:41:54] <Velveeta> do you need the actual button or just the event?
[20:41:54] <BillCriswell> bobdobbs: .find('#button-id') I guess? Think that's fastest.
[20:42:27] <bobdobbs> Velveeta: good question. I hadn't thought of that
[20:42:44] <Velveeta> if you just need the event, you can  bind it on the form itself
[20:42:54] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[20:43:03] <Velveeta> and that way if they submit via something like pressing enter in a text field, it catches that also
[20:43:10] <bobdobbs> what do you mean by 'binding it to the form'?
[20:43:26] <Velveeta> $('#myform').on('submit', callback);
[20:43:48] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[20:43:56] <bobdobbs> sounds like I need to do more homework.
[20:43:57] <BillCriswell> I thought they just wanted to find the submit button haha.
[20:43:57] <Velveeta> if you grab the submit button and do something like bind a click handler to it, it won't catch something like the user pressing enter in a text field
[20:44:01] <bobdobbs> thanks guys :)
[20:44:20] <Velveeta> bill: right, that's why i figured i'd ask :)
[20:44:39] <Velveeta> most of the time you don't need the actual button, just the actual submit event
[20:44:41] <bobdobbs> well, I haven't worked with binding events before.
[20:44:53] <Velveeta> welcome to jquery! :)
[20:44:55] <bobdobbs> sounds like I need to figure that out
[20:45:02] <Velveeta> event-driven development is awesome :)
[20:45:08] <bobdobbs> yeah?
[20:45:11] <Velveeta> yessir
[20:45:22] <bobdobbs> darnit. You just added more homework to my homework
[20:45:29] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[20:45:39] <bobdobbs> brb, bacon
[20:45:42] <Velveeta> and on that note, i have to go to sleep now, so i can live on coffee alone tomorrow
[20:51:03] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Good night again!
[21:23:27] <Ericx2x> hey guys
[21:23:45] <Ericx2x> i have a slider which has three slides
[21:24:00] <Ericx2x> i need to generate different text for each different slide that overlays on the slides image
[21:24:11] <Ericx2x> can someone help me figure out how to do this?
[21:24:24] <Ericx2x> i.e. if the slide changes new text is generated on top of it
[22:08:57] <SDr> howdy,
[22:09:02] <SDr> video.js or flowplayer?
[22:41:35] <czytacz2> http://jsbin.com/ipipENU/1/edit
[22:42:21] <czytacz2> can somebody tell me how can I extract id value from <tr> element after clicking it? the above functin does not work
[23:44:18] <Cork> czytacz2: $(this).attr('id')
