[00:00:02] <doug65536> raj: yes. also, detach preserves event handlers
[00:01:20] <doug65536> raj: if you don't need to preserve event handlers, I can show a way that makes it easier to put them back where they came from
[00:01:30] <raj> although I find the return value unreadable, I like the assigning of a and b
[00:01:51] <raj> so if you don't detach, eventhandlers are lost when doing .append?
[00:01:51] <doug65536> you see the pattern though right?
[00:02:03] <doug65536> if you .remove() event handlers are lost
[00:02:15] <raj> but if we append, the DOM element is moved
[00:02:20] <raj> so why detach?
[00:02:23] <raj> or remove
[00:02:25] <doug65536> what?
[00:03:04] <doug65536> why remove? to make it possible to change the order without extreme screwing around
[00:03:18] <raj> if I $('#somecontainer').append('#someelement')...it's just gonna move the existing element
[00:03:22] <doug65536> you have to remove them to change their position
[00:03:36] <doug65536> raj: go for it. good luck
[00:04:12] <raj> so it shouldn't be an issue?
[00:05:23] <doug65536> raj: what you are saying doesn't make sense
[00:05:28] <raj> why not?
[00:05:33] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/EGygs/16/
[00:06:35] <raj> why is that any worse?
[00:06:38] <doug65536> no difference
[00:07:19] <raj> so then .detach() is unneccessary, no?
[00:07:31] <doug65536> my code makes it clear what's happening. yours is completely unclear
[00:07:43] <raj> by removing .detach()?
[00:08:21] <doug65536> to me, appending something that is already in the dom is borderline nonsense
[00:08:40] <raj> ah, so that's the stigma
[00:09:10] <doug65536> does yours preserve event handlers? who knows?
[00:09:22] <doug65536> I know my version does
[00:10:02] <raj> ya, mine does
[00:10:17] <doug65536> raj: are we really arguing about this. dude, you're welcome
[00:10:24] <raj> arguing?
[00:10:33] <raj> I'm learning
[00:10:56] <doug65536> I prefer to be explicit than implicit
[00:11:12] <raj> fair enough
[00:11:12] <doug65536> If I can say what to do rather than letting it magically happen behind the scenes, I say it
[00:11:44] <doug65536> then the next guy who looks at my code and doesn't need to be a wizard, he can see that the nodes get removed and readded
[00:11:55] <doug65536> without knowing the ins and outs of append's behavior
[00:12:42] <doug65536> that's why explicit is better, it doesn't force the person maintaining the code to have to know everything
[00:14:09] <doug65536> aka POLS, or principal of least surprise. another dev might see your code and go, "wtf??" he's appending something that's already in the dom? I've never seen that before. does it duplicate it? does it move it? idk... guess I have to run it and see...
[00:14:58] <raj> gotcha

[00:51:56] <jsmonkey> is there a way to group two or more elements to behave like one using hover or mouseenter etc?
[00:52:02] <jsmonkey> or do I have to wrap them in a parent?
[00:52:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: what do you mean?
[00:52:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grouping
[00:52:38] <xec> you could simply select two elements and attach the same handler to them?
[00:52:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> like as in calling the same hover event on multiple items that have same class
[00:53:09] * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with xec
[00:53:35] <xec> something like $("#idone, #idtwo").on("mouseenter", func...)
[00:54:08] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: I have a menu. when I hover over a element I want to slidedown a sub menu. When the mouse leaves either the sub menu or the top menu item I want it to slide up again. but when moving from top menu item to the slided down sub menu I get an event onleave
[00:54:26] <jsmonkey> should I use a delay? wrap in parent and filter out the outer classes?
[00:54:31] <jsmonkey> all suggestions are welcome!
[00:54:58] <xec> if you make the submenu a descendant of of the toplevel one, you won't get the leave event
[00:55:09] <xec> (until you've left both)
[00:55:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: first i would use a ul-li structure: do you have that
[00:55:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: i have idea but i need to get some info from jsmonkey
[00:56:45] <xec> jolly good :)
[00:57:14] <Dudi> hello I have some div in array and I want remove last div form that array in containing div
[00:57:17] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: it's a UL but it's wrapped in divs etc and I can't change that
[00:57:20] <Dudi> http://jsfiddle.net/5jMPW/
[00:57:22] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: what do you have in mind?
[00:58:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: i wrote a menu for a client a few weeks ago that has a dropdown menu but strictly in css
[00:59:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: so i ask you what is your structure for your menu
[00:59:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it ul-li
[00:59:17] <xec> Dudi: what is that demo supposed to do? remove th "dudi"?
[00:59:25] <jsmonkey> I see, I need to have js because of the control for mobile and tablet features
[00:59:32] <jsmonkey> it behave somewhat different (are going to)
[00:59:34] <Dudi> xec yes
[00:59:53] <DevAntoine> hi
[01:00:02] <xec> Dudi: http://jsfiddle.net/5jMPW/1/
[01:00:06] <jsmonkey> $('.someEl').not('.aChildOfSomeEl') does not work. I get the top item .someEl along with all children and .aChildOfSomeEl. shouldn't that be filtered out?
[01:00:46] <DevAntoine> Why this two lines remove the html from the first selector? var content = $('table', $(this).attr('href')); $('.modal-body', '#logsPrepaStorelandModal').html(content);
[01:00:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: well try
[01:01:09] <xec> jsmonkey: .not() is opposite of .filter(), and only looks at the top level elements in the selection
[01:01:23] <jsmonkey> xec: that figures! thanks
[01:01:24] <xec> jsmonkey: if you want to look at the children, use .children()
[01:01:35] <xec> jsmonkey: if you want descendants, try .find()
[01:01:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> $('.someEl :not(.aChildOfSomeEl)')
[01:01:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: : that should work
[01:01:51] <Dudi> xec oooo I didn't know that selectedUser is reference :D
[01:01:52] <Dudi> coool:D
[01:02:39] <xec> Dudi: in that demo you don't need the .last() of course, but since that's what you asked about ;)
[01:03:22] <Dudi> xec ofc.. but in real there will be more than one :)
[01:03:41] <jsmonkey> hm it does not solve my problem
[01:03:57] <jsmonkey> how to best make two elements beahve like one in the context of moseenter/hover event?
[01:04:22] <jsmonkey> when adding more elements I get both enter and leave when moving from two elements that should be grouped
[01:04:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> youre question isnt clear
[01:06:06] <xec> jsmonkey: can you show us a jsfiddle with what you have so far?
[01:07:18] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: if you have two divs called id A and id B. they are on top of each other, stacked. lets say I do $('#a, #b').hover.. or mouseenter. the event is triggered when I am moving to id A but without leaving id A and going to id B, a event is triggedred for leaving id A when going to id B that is next to it
[01:07:31] <jsmonkey> I don't want it to say "leaving" when I am moving the mouse from div A to div B
[01:08:09] <jsmonkey> but the events are added seperated so I get something like onEnter, onLeave, onEnter when moving the mouse to div A and then to div B
[01:08:16] <xec> jsmonkey: i take that as a "no"?
[01:08:27] <jsmonkey> xec: yes sorry no fiddle
[01:08:30] <xec> ?demo @ jsmonkey
[01:08:30] <b-ot> jsmonkey: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:08:55] * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with xec to make fiddle
[01:09:09] <jsmonkey> forget the menu and all, I want to group elements and not retrigger element
[01:09:17] <xec> you can't do that
[01:09:39] <jsmonkey> xec: ok so then I will stop trying to group element and stuff
[01:10:01] <jsmonkey> what about hover element on div A. which makes div B slidedown (hidden from start)
[01:10:26] <jsmonkey> no, Im stuck :P
[01:10:27] <xec> don't type out what your structure looks like, make a small fiddle
[01:10:39] <jsmonkey> I am thinking I can make a slight delay in time? so the mouse can move between?
[01:10:43] <xec> it's a hundred times easier to see what you mean
[01:10:51] <jsmonkey> I see, I will make a simple fiddle
[01:13:01] * Rohan_Bhangui is happy
[01:24:55] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui , xec : http://jsfiddle.net/ZhXYH/5/
[01:25:06] <jsmonkey> when you press test. a sub menu is slided down.
[01:25:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> and what is the intended behavious
[01:25:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> *behaviour
[01:25:37] <jsmonkey> I want that behavior but when someone hovering a top menu item AND it should toggle back up when leaving either the top menu item or the sub menu item
[01:26:09] <jsmonkey> my problem is that when I try using hover or mouseenter etc I get a mouseenter event when going from top menu item to sub menu item
[01:26:17] <jsmonkey> get mouseEnter, mouseLeave, mouseEnter
[01:26:24] <jsmonkey> when going from top menu item (#A) to sub menu item (#B)
[01:29:08] <patchy> how can i eliminate the max-height in a css file? (greasemonkey) code --> div.ui-accordion-content.contentPanel{ max-height: 550px; }
[01:29:52] <_rgn> !important?
[01:32:42] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: understand what I try to do?
[01:32:55] <jsmonkey> like this but without the fail :P
[01:32:55] <jsmonkey> http://jsfiddle.net/ZhXYH/6/
[01:33:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsmonkey: how is it failing
[01:34:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: a bit of help
[01:34:40] <xec> and you can't change the html?
[01:34:46] <xec> may i ask why?
[01:35:00] <jsmonkey> Rohan_Bhangui: when you move from the top to the bottom
[01:35:06] <jsmonkey> it does not stay open
[01:35:13] <jsmonkey> because it triggers a leave event
[01:35:31] <jsmonkey> I need them to behave like two elements and as you guys said, that is not possible with the hover event
[01:35:37] <jsmonkey> so you said for me to make a jsfiddle :)
[01:35:47] <jsmonkey> maybe I should try to use a timer delay
[01:35:58] <jsmonkey> so it does not trigger right away and there is time move from A to B

[01:50:48] <xec> patchy: .css() will set an inline rule, which overrides whatever selector
[01:51:45] <patchy> xec: aha..hmm i will check that out ..tanks
[01:52:58] <_rgn> the problem might be that you have to always apply the css to new elements somehow

[02:00:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> we are thinking
[02:01:04] <xec> jsmonkey: can you change the html structure?
[02:01:35] <jsmonkey> xec: go ahead
[02:02:21] <jsmonkey> xec: making the sub menu a child of the top menu item?
[02:02:52] <xec> yes
[02:03:58] <xec> jsmonkey: i realise this isnt exactly what you want, but it will circumvent the loss-of-focus issue http://jsfiddle.net/ZhXYH/7/

[02:06:42] <jsmonkey> xec: ye, that is exactly what I was thinking. I will try to see if this will work with my other layout as you can imagine the menu is a bit more complicated than that with 4 levels etc
[02:06:50] <jsmonkey> but maybe will work, thanks for your input!
[02:12:10] <xec> jsmonkey: another option: http://jsfiddle.net/ZhXYH/10/
[02:22:32] <patchy> xec: it doesnt work..hmm

[02:25:36] <xec> patchy: the css selector doesnt match the html
[02:26:59] <xec> patchy: also, you should close a div with </div> instead of <div> :P

[02:39:24] <patchy> xec: well..it works in your editor..but not on my site..
[02:39:48] <patchy> but i think i know what the problem might be..the menu i want to enlargen is loading after the greasemonkey code

[02:49:58] <bergi9> its seems the data-role="panel" still doesnt work outside of data-role="page"
[02:50:30] <no_gravity> Cork: what do you mean? the error is in jquery.
[02:50:37] <no_gravity> Cork: you can see it on jquery.com for example.
[02:50:57] <bergi9> if i push the panel container into the page container, its work

[02:52:52] <bergi9> for me, the new freature of jquerymobile beta 1.4 isnt the truth
[02:53:06] <RageYL> i am doing an ajax request that update a database
[02:53:17] <RageYL> if i resend the same request, i abort the first one
[02:53:32] <RageYL> it is possible that i cancel the request during the update of database
[02:53:43] <RageYL> (is it possible i make a double insert ?)
[02:54:43] <no_gravity> RageYL: mysql?
[02:54:58] <RageYL> in fact i update an access database
[02:55:30] <no_gravity> RageYL: well, check first if the record already exists, then if not - insert.
[02:55:50] <no_gravity> RageYL: doesnt sound very jquery related.
[02:55:55] <Thoams> ^
[02:56:07] <RageYL> yes but it's for having some of your advice ^^

[02:59:53] <jcrawford> hello everyone, anyone here have much experience working with Indeterminite checkbox states?  I have to make this work with a table column of check boxes but the only samples I can find require the use of ul elements, if anyone could assist I would appreciate it.  I need to convert this to use a th/td/checkbox and tr/td/checkboxes.
[03:00:19] <jcrawford> I am not looking for someone to implement the solution but to tell me if it is possible and how to go about doing it.  Here is the example I am working from: http://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/

[03:07:09] <jcrawford> doug65536: ......?
[03:07:31] <doug65536> jcrawford: what?
[03:07:55] <jcrawford> I know how to set the property.. the issue is the code at css-tricks works on ul/li elements. I need it to work on thead/tr/th and tbody/tr/td just not sure how or if it is possible to do with that code
[03:08:48] <jcrawford> a page can have many tables, each table will have a header checkbox and a column of checks, each table should work independently of each other blah blah.  Not quite sure how to go about making these changes and could use some guidance
[03:11:23] <doug65536> jcrawford: what are you talking about? I don't see any code on there that works with any table
[03:11:46] <jcrawford> doug65536: i found this code: http://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/
[03:11:55] <jcrawford> it works with a ul/li list
[03:12:00] <doug65536> where
[03:12:22] <jcrawford> doug65536: sorry my bad: http://css-tricks.com/examples/IndeterminateCheckboxes/
[03:12:27] <jcrawford> have to go to the demo.
[03:12:58] <jcrawford> this works on ul/li elements i need to know is it possible to rework this to use a thead/tr/th and tbody/tr/td structure instead
[03:13:32] <doug65536> jcrawford: what you probably want to do is walk up the parents, and see if all the siblings are the same value. if not, then the parent is indeterminate, if all checked, parent is checked, if all not checked, parent is not checked
[03:14:06] <doug65536> jcrawford: a table is not a tree. how are you planning to convert a tree to a grid
[03:14:24] <jcrawford> thats what i am wondering if it is even possible
[03:14:48] <jcrawford> i have 2 requirements one to use a table for this data output with a column of checkboxes the other to implement this indeterminite ui stuff
[03:15:16] <doug65536> jcrawford: it is possible sure
[03:15:23] <doug65536> jcrawford: just not as elegant as lists
[03:15:47] <jcrawford> thats understandable, now to figure out how i can get this done :)
[03:16:15] <doug65536> so if you are in column n, then the all of the children of it would be in column n+1
[03:16:38] <doug65536> this is homework, right?
[03:16:39] <jcrawford> why would it be n+1 wouldn't that send it to the next column?
[03:16:45] <jcrawford> not homework at all
[03:16:57] <jcrawford> my boss likes this UI element and wants it in place on some admin screens we have
[03:17:14] <doug65536> it sounds like an exercise in recursion
[03:17:21] <jcrawford> i am a backend developer :)
[03:17:30] <jcrawford> so this front-end stuff is a bit tricky for me
[03:17:53] <doug65536> so it must be a table then
[03:17:54] <_rgn> don't put a label on yourself!
[03:18:04] <jcrawford> _rgn: im working on breaking that label :D
[03:18:25] <jcrawford> its the realm ive been pushed to at most of my employers now time to get a grip on the front end stuff.
[03:18:26] <greg_f> :)
[03:18:37] <jcrawford> doug65536: unfortunately yes he wants this data in tables as it is tabular data
[03:22:23] <doug65536> jcrawford: like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/yuHXZ/
[03:22:43] <doug65536> jcrawford: it's a bad idea to use a table for a tree
[03:24:51] <doug65536> jcrawford: because a grid is not a tree. you are pounding a square peg into a round hole
[03:26:31] <jcrawford> hmm
[03:26:48] <doug65536> jcrawford: a more appropriate but ridiculous approach would be nesting tables, but what good would that be?
[03:27:17] <doug65536> you would be faking lists with a bunch of unnecessary overhead
[03:27:25] <jcrawford> doug65536: moment i will show you my exact structure
[03:27:50] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/yuHXZ/1/
[03:29:20] <doug65536> jcrawford: so that top checkbox is like a "select all" checkbox? like a webmail implementation?
[03:30:12] <jcrawford> doug65536: formatted better: http://jsfiddle.net/yuHXZ/2/
[03:31:20] <doug65536> jcrawford: click tidyup at the top. it will auto format it
[03:31:20] <jcrawford> oh very nice
[03:32:15] <jcrawford> doug65536: here it is with the css in place: http://jsfiddle.net/yuHXZ/4/
[03:37:48] <doug65536> jcrawford: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/yuHXZ/5/
[03:38:41] <jcrawford> thats almost perfect
[03:38:55] <jcrawford> except when i click the header checkbox it should check and uncheck all others
[03:39:05] <jcrawford> right now clicking it seems to do nothing not even check itself :)
[03:39:47] <doug65536> np
[03:40:46] <jcrawford> love how you set this up very clean
[03:40:53] <jcrawford> and easy to understand as well

[03:46:59] <jcrawford> that is perfect, now i need to digest this to understand it all
[03:47:35] <doug65536> jcrawford: I'll write in some comments to help
[03:48:00] <jcrawford> i understand most of it, just the filter on the parent i am not grasping

[03:51:16] <doug65536> jcrawford: I could also make it more strict, in case there are other unrelated checkboxes around
[03:51:32] <jcrawford> there could be on the page yes
[03:51:36] <jcrawford> tyvm doug this is greatly appreciated
[03:51:41] <doug65536> no, I mean within the table
[03:51:43] <doug65536> np
[03:52:24] <jcrawford> oh hmm i guess he could come up with that requirement
[03:53:36] <doug65536> jcrawford: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/yuHXZ/18/
[03:53:54] <doug65536> I don't see how things inside a "checkbox" classed element would be any more specific
[03:54:08] <doug65536> but I did make it only put handlers on tables with class 'journal'
[03:54:48] <jcrawford> ok cool
[03:54:50] <jcrawford> looking now
[03:55:57] <jcrawford> doug65536: whats the best way to learn more about JQuery would you suggest books, this channel, online training video's etc.  I need to ramp up on this, while I understand what you just wrote understanding how to write it or where to begin is another story :)
[03:56:24] <doug65536> jcrawford: this is my favorite jquery documentation viewer http://jqapi.com/
[03:56:35] <jcrawford> it's second nature for me when it comes to server side stuff, but the front-end is not
[03:56:52] <doug65536> this channel is pretty good. I learned a lot solving random issues
[03:57:16] <doug65536> how well do you know css selectors?
[03:57:28] <doug65536> having a solid understanding of css selectors helps a lot
[03:57:36] <jcrawford> awesome i will add that to my list of reference
[03:58:03] <jcrawford> i understand css selectors when it comes to id's and classes when you start getting into nth-child etc that's where i will get lost
[03:58:15] <doug65536> jcrawford: this is good http://learn.jquery.com/
[03:58:59] <jcrawford> *bookmarked
[03:59:20] <jcrawford> i'll spend some time going through this today
[03:59:51] <doug65536> jcrawford: definitely go through these exercises http://try.jquery.com/
[04:00:32] <doug65536> I'd say do that last one first
[04:00:40] <doug65536> it will make the rest make a lot more sense
[04:02:28] <jcrawford> ok will do
[04:02:44] <jcrawford> something is not working when i put that js into my page heh
[04:02:55] <doug65536> where is it?
[04:03:31] <doug65536> jcrawford: if you load it in head, nothing exists yet. change it to be like this: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/yuHXZ/20/
[04:03:36] <tedster> Is this a support page for jqm aswell?
[04:03:48] <doug65536> jcrawford: that $(function() { ... }) thing will run ... when the document is ready
[04:04:23] <Guest33529> Hi, I need to load 10 JSON files, is it possible to load them with 1 ajax call? Because I need a success function that runs when all the files are loaded
[04:04:28] <jcrawford> oy i should have noticed it didn't have the dom ready bit
[04:04:32] <jcrawford> thanks doug65536
[04:04:35] <tedster> im running a basic page with a left sided panel. On document ready i check if the window width is above 400px, if so i open the panel. Problem is, when i open a dialog from my basic page, the document ready gets fired for that aswell, and then it throws me an error because it cannot open my panel (cos it doesn't exist in my dialog)
[04:04:51] <tedster> So should i use something else then document ready?
[04:05:35] <doug65536> jcrawford: np
[04:05:50] <patchy> my code works here: http://jsfiddle.net/Vj9Dy/ but it doesnt work on the actual webpage with greasemonkey. I think its because the menu with the html code is appearing some secounds after the greasemonkey code has been run.. can this be the case?
[04:06:49] <doug65536> tedster: I don't think it is possible to get document ready twice. can you make a fiddle or show code?
[04:07:36] <tedster> http://192.168.0.9/My/tickets.php
[04:07:38] <tedster> oups rofl
[04:07:44] <tedster> www.smartload.eu/My/tickets.php
[04:07:53] <tedster> as you see the panel opens when u open the page
[04:08:04] <tedster> but after that, if u click the button on the bottom of the main page, you get an error
[04:08:46] <tedster> oh no sorry, u don't get the error right away, but after the address bar is changed to : tickets.php#&ui-state=dialog
[04:08:51] <tedster> and you refresh the page, you get the error
[04:09:06] <tedster> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on panel prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[04:09:32] <tedster> http://pastebin.com/w5b0RrwR
[04:09:35] <tedster> this is the code that is causing it
[04:09:48] <tedster> line 5 to be exact
[04:09:57] <doug65536> tedster: you are invoking it repeatedly
[04:10:03] <tedster> how so?
[04:10:35] <jcrawford> wow i wonder if code school is worth the cost, seems they don't have a lot of paid courses just yet
[04:10:35] <doug65536> tedster: here's how document ready works: if the document isn't ready yet, it remembers your function and ignores it. if the document is already ready, it runs your function immediately
[04:10:44] <jcrawford> 250/yr isn't that bad though
[04:11:23] <tedster> yeah, but why does it behave differently if i have #&ui-state=dialog in the addressbar?
[04:11:45] <doug65536> tedster: if it ignored your function, it runs it when the document is ready. does that make sense?
[04:12:08] <tedster> well yeah, but that error makes 0 sense
[04:12:26] <doug65536> tedster: every time pageinit happens it runs that document ready handler again
[04:12:46] <tedster> yeah, does the dialog invoke pageinit?
[04:13:46] <tedster> but seriously, that error only happends if i have that annoying hashtag parameter in my url
[04:13:53] <tedster> why?
[04:14:44] <doug65536> tedster: wait a second... the chrome messed up the autoindent. forget that last thing I said
[04:15:36] <doug65536> tedster: your page breaks chrome debugger lol
[04:15:46] <tedster> wtf :D
[04:16:49] <doug65536> tedster: it's easily broken. maybe I should restart the buggy piece of crap :P
[04:19:52] <doug65536> tedster: it would be helpful if you switched to the debugging version of jquery and jquery mobile
[04:20:09] <doug65536> tedster: it's all gibberish where the error happens
[04:20:48] <doug65536> tedster: cannot call methods on panel prior to init
[04:21:05] <tedster> yeah
[04:21:15] <tedster> i dont see why the hashtag parameter causes that
[04:22:07] <tedster> my thought was that it was looking for the panel element within the dialog
[04:22:11] <doug65536> tedster: who cares why? put that stuff in pageinit callback
[04:22:50] <doug65536> I've come to expect jqm to do the unexpected. I don't bother trying to figure out why it does what it does anymore
[04:24:27] <doug65536> tedster: the answer is fairly self-evident. you can't open that panel until it is initialized. it is evidently not initialized. if that were in pageinit, it would be, right?
[04:26:11] <doug65536> tedster: apparently, document ready is too early. it appears that you can get away with it when that hash tag isn't there
[04:28:14] <doug65536> tedster: my guess is, it has to do something async in that scenario, so the document becomes ready before pageinit happens
[04:30:56] <tedster> yeah well that worked
[04:30:57] <tedster> thx doug
[04:31:03] <doug65536> tedster: np
[04:31:28] <tedster> so difference between pageinit and document ready is still quite hard for me to understand
[04:31:48] <doug65536> tedster: think of pageinit as jquery-mobile-is-ready
[04:31:59] <tedster> owever, in jQuery Mobile, Ajax is used to load the contents of each page into the DOM as you navigate. Because of this $(document).ready() will trigger before your first page is loaded and every code intended for page manipulation will be executed after a page refresh
[04:34:55] <doug65536> tedster: yeah, so while it is waiting for that ajax response, the document becomes ready before jquery mobile is "ready" (pageinit)
[04:35:32] <doug65536> I think
[04:40:22] <tedster> great
[04:40:43] <tedster> now it somehow broke the responsivness on my page when i programtically open the left sidebar panel
[04:41:29] <tedster> http://pastebin.com/mwxRLTEJ
[04:41:39] <tedster> if i open the panel using the menu button
[04:41:53] <tedster> the main content is resized
[04:42:02] <tedster> but when i open it programtically, the content isn't resized
[04:42:23] <tedster> www.smartload.eu/My/tickets.php
[04:42:26] <tedster> heres the link again
[04:43:28] <tedster> i tried, and this issue is gone if i move $("#mypanel").panel( "open" ); under document.ready instead of pageinit
[04:43:49] <tedster> but then im back to my original error :D
[04:44:01] <doug65536> tedster: what issue? the button works for me
[04:44:47] <tedster> the issue being, i want the panel to open every time the page is refreshed
[04:45:04] <tedster> and when the panel is opened i want the content to be resized so that the page is usable even though the panel is visible
[04:45:26] <tedster> this works if i open the panel by click the menu button up in the left corner
[04:45:44] <doug65536> tedster: I see
[04:45:46] <tedster> but it doesn't work when the page loads, elements in my main page get pushed offset
[04:47:33] <tedster> pageload sounds right, but its not invoked at all
[04:48:37] <tedster> pageshow did the trick
[04:48:38] <tedster> wtf
[04:48:50] <tedster> there needs to be a book on these events, not 5 lines of explanations :D
[04:56:57] <tedster> how do you add options when creating this
[04:56:57] <tedster> $("#mypanel").panel( "open", {"dismissible":false});
[05:00:15] <Cork> redbrick: what options?
[05:00:49] <Cork> uh..
[05:00:59] <Cork> *tedster:
[05:02:26] <tedster> LOL!
[05:02:31] <tedster> in order for this to work
[05:02:33] <tedster> i have to add
[05:02:34] <tedster> data-dismissible=""
[05:02:37] <tedster> to the markup
[05:02:54] <tedster> apparently if its not "defined" there, you can't change it afterwards
[05:03:09] <tedster> <div data-role="panel" id="mypanel" data-dismissible="">
[05:04:47] <anli_> What is $("form").on("submit.validate", and how can I have it run only on validation?
[05:05:14] <Cork> anli: it's a namespace for events
[05:05:38] <anli_> I did not find that namespace in the entire project except where I use it
[05:05:47] <anli_> Should mean that jquery validate builds up strings magically
[05:06:05] <Cork> anli: that is in jquery core
[05:06:12] <Cork> you can add what ever string you want after .
[05:06:16] <Cork> and it will be a namespace
[05:06:17] <anli_> I have it all in my project
[05:06:31] <anli_> Searching in the entire project should give me some definition of it
[05:06:36] <Cork> $('').on('click.my-handler')
[05:06:47] <Cork> anli: you are looking at the definition
[05:06:53] <anli_> The usage
[05:06:56] <Cork> $('').on('click.my-handler', function() {})
[05:07:02] <Cork> $('').off('.my-handler')
[05:07:05] <anli_> ah
[05:07:29] <anli_> So I can expect to find .validate then, at least on the definition place and on 1000 other places
[05:07:41] <Cork> yes
[05:07:51] <Cork> it is a way to group event listeners together
[05:07:52] <anli_> You are always a helping hand
[05:07:55] <anli_> ok
[05:27:53] <icjs> hi, i have an accordian widget defined with $( "#accordion" ).accordion(..) but i use that in multiple rows where i reference that widget with <div id="accordion" ..> - obviously this means only the first such div. but what if my divs are in a loop which is producing multiple rows?
[05:30:12] <sunbeam> I'm looking for a plugin that is able to create the jquery bricks effect,
[05:30:22] <sunbeam> so that all li's with their content fill up the max available width
[05:30:26] <sunbeam> any idea what i can best use?
[05:36:12] <eeezkil> I'm using a jquery dialog and everything works fine.. but when I move it in an app it gets buggy.. when I try to move it the top position of the element gets multiplied by itself for example (1,2,4,16...)
[05:36:33] <eeezkil> the 1 is wrong there.. :D
[05:47:34] <jned> You know the zazar weather feed plugin, well yahoo's feed isn't free for commercial use, so how easy is it to adapt to accuweather or weather.gc.ca
[05:51:35] <sunbeam> all bricks/ tiles or whatever its called need to be have the same height/width and the same proportions
[06:20:20] <anli_> Using jquery validate, if I have validation errors in my form and that is detected by the client side validation, dom modifications that I have done dissapears, why?
[06:20:47] <anli_> Is the form cloned in some way?
[06:22:37] <patchy> i am trying to make a menu follow when you are scrolling down the page..any idea what i am doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/RCKCA/
[06:24:02] <patchy> update: http://jsfiddle.net/RCKCA/1/
[06:35:17] <doug65536> patchy: you didn't enable jquery in the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RCKCA/2/
[06:37:03] <anli_> For some reason, tr.find(':hidden').remove() is interpreted as tr.remove(), why?
[06:37:12] <anli_> There is a :hidden selector, right?
[06:38:09] <doug65536> anli_: there is
[06:38:23] <patchy> doug65536: thanks
[06:38:32] <anli_> The whole tr as removed as a result of me running that
[06:38:40] <anli_> s/as/was
[06:42:28] <doug65536> anli_: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/UwVpt/
[06:42:37] <anli_> ok!
[06:42:42] <anli_> should take a loook
[06:42:42] <doug65536> anli_: is it in the dom?
[06:42:44] <anli_> look
[06:42:46] <anli_> yes
[06:42:53] <anli_> If there is no hidden, nothing should happen
[06:43:02] <doug65536> correct
[06:44:50] <anli_> ah, :hidden is of course not what I should select for
[06:44:55] <anli_> Its an input type="hidden"
[06:44:55] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/UwVpt/1/
[06:44:59] <anli_> Isnt there a shortcut for those?
[06:45:06] <anli_> Like :text
[06:45:19] <doug65536> shortcut? input[type=hidden]
[06:45:27] <anli_> thats a longcut ;)
[06:45:40] <anli_> I like your descriptive example
[06:45:42] <doug65536> they don't have shortcuts for everything
[06:46:00] <doug65536> :input is a shortcut
[06:46:11] <anli_> But for a hidden element
[06:46:16] <anli_> not a hiddenelement ;)
[06:46:51] <anli_> Changing to input [type=hidden] then
[06:47:01] <doug65536> without a space
[06:47:03] <doug65536> :)
[07:10:27] <dwarder> there is console.dir to output object stucture to browsers console, is there a way i can add the output to an element i.e. $("#debug").html(console.dir(myObject));
[07:10:30] <dwarder> ?
[07:11:15] <doug65536> yes
[07:11:55] <doug65536> dwarder: depends on what you mean though. you mean simple text output?
[07:11:57] <dwarder> doug65536: so the way i wrote it?
[07:12:07] <doug65536> dwarder: no
[07:12:20] <dwarder> doug65536: i need console.dir's output in my element
[07:12:34] <doug65536> dir?
[07:12:37] <doug65536> don't you mean log?
[07:12:42] <dwarder> doug65536: no, dir
[07:12:49] <dwarder> doug65536: as print_r in php
[07:12:58] <dwarder> doug65536: this is what console.dir does
[07:13:25] <dwarder> doug65536: the more you know ;)
[07:14:05] <doug65536> well, the documentation on mdn doesn't say it returns anything. your code will just empty the #debug element's contents
[07:14:57] <doug65536> dwarder: with a bit of work you could come up with something that works like that
[07:15:41] <doug65536> dwarder: sounds like a "make work" project though. something wrong with the console that's already there?
[07:17:05] <dwarder> doug65536: just need to output this stuff to an element
[07:17:25] <dwarder> doug65536: well, i remember i can highjack the console output ... soooo
[07:17:35] <doug65536> sure you can
[07:17:48] <doug65536> I doubt console.dir calls console.log
[07:18:20] <doug65536> sounds like you have all the answers. go for it
[07:20:09] <dwarder> doug65536: thank you
[07:20:15] <dwarder> i use slice(-1)[0] to get the last element of my array, how do i push() to this last element?
[07:20:39] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/Y6qAc/
[07:21:14] <dev11> pls confirm if this will work always 100% sure on all browsers? becasue I am about to use it on a production live website
[07:21:19] <dev11> I can't let something bad happen
[07:21:35] <dev11> $('#bb-widget-promobox-0').load(function() {  //your code (will be called once iframe is done loading)
[07:21:35] <dev11> });
[07:21:44] <doug65536> nothing works 100% sure on all browsers
[07:21:59] <dev11> ok ie8+
[07:22:07] <dev11> but this will work 100% for sure always?
[07:22:09] <dev11> is this ok
[07:22:17] <dev11> what I want is to do something after iframes are loaded
[07:22:21] <dev11> to chagne their margins
[07:22:30] <dev11> because the yare dynamically loaded
[07:22:34] <NoiseEee> dev11: i have an idea, why don't you test?
[07:22:37] <dev11> so to avoid margin I have to use javascript
[07:22:42] <dev11> how
[07:23:02] <dev11> NoiseEee, pls englihte me
[07:23:06] <dev11> how can i test um
[07:23:07] <dev11> ?
[07:23:12] <dev11> damn people
[07:23:13] <NoiseEee> at the very least, why not TRY IT
[07:23:18] <dev11> HOW HOW HOW
[07:23:20] <NoiseEee> on DIFFERENT BROWSERS
[07:23:22] <NoiseEee> what do you mean how?!?
[07:24:05] <doug65536> dev11: you want .on('load', function() ... ) don't you?
[07:24:43] <doug65536> dev11: and no need to get mad at NoiseEee , there are testing services, if you bothered to look
[07:25:19] <dev11> im not sure how to ttest it
[07:25:20] <dev11> im not mad
[07:25:27] <dev11> what are those testing services man
[07:25:38] <dev11> I am not sure this cant be tested
[07:25:45] <doug65536> here's one http://browsershots.org/
[07:25:52] <NoiseEee> dev11: well i mean, at minimum, have you tried that code on your test site / development site/etc?
[07:26:28] <doug65536> lol
[07:26:32] <doug65536> I think he's mad
[07:26:45] <NoiseEee> i think he's completely unfamiliar with JS
[07:27:23] <doug65536> maybe jquery is *too* easy to use :P
[07:28:23] <jned> see here http://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-77_metric_e.html at the bottom is the weather atom feed link, but it has 'city' in the link so not sure about that, and why I try to load the feed using http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/ it says 'cannot load feed'

[07:39:32] <sebsen> hi, know anyone a smart method to display the response of an ajaxcall?
[07:39:42] <juboba> sebsen, jSmart
[07:40:15] <jned> doug65536, ooooh man, you are too kind
[07:40:28] <sebsen> damn, thanks juboba...
[07:42:22] <juboba> if I load a partial using ('#div').load(url) can I call $(document).ready(function(){}) to check if the div is done loading or should I use something else?
[07:42:58] <doug65536> juboba: pass a function to load as the 2nd parameter, it will call it when the load is done
[07:43:48] <juboba> doug65536, that wont work in my script
[07:43:57] <doug65536> $('#div').load(url, function() { ... load is done when this runs ...});
[07:43:58] <juboba> I'm loading lots of pages through this method
[07:44:07] <sebsen> juboba if u load a dialog u have to init it when its finished
[07:44:28] <juboba> I need to do this from the partial that is loading
[07:44:37] <juboba> sebsen, yes, that's my issue
[07:44:52] <doug65536> juboba: there's no reason that that won't work for an unlimited number of loads
[07:44:53] <sebsen> $('#div').load(url, function() { $(selector').initDialog()});
[07:46:18] <sebsen> but u have to get sure that u only init the Dialog of the new data not the old one who have been loaded before
[07:46:55] <juboba> uhmm
[07:47:21] <juboba> isn't there a way that I can check from the loading partial if it is ready loading?
[07:47:31] <doug65536> juboba: yeah, I told you already
[07:47:40] <juboba> doug65536, ?
[07:47:58] <juboba> you're telling me that the LOADER runs a function when the LOADED is ready
[07:48:02] <doug65536> juboba: it's not a document, it doesn't "become ready" it is simply a fragment
[07:48:06] <juboba> I want the LOADED to do this
[07:49:09] <doug65536> juboba: do you understand what "it will call it when the load is done" means?
[07:50:02] <juboba> yes doug65536
[07:50:13] <doug65536> juboba: you have the wrong idea about what .load does. it does an ajax request, takes the response and slaps it in as a child of #div
[07:50:19] <doug65536> there is no "document ready" or any of that
[07:50:29] <juboba> I know
[07:50:58] <juboba> ok
[07:51:16] <barryhjames> So I have a page (http://sfys.jameswebdevelopment.com/performers.php) where when someone clicks on a photo or link, it moves that photo to the top of the other photos and displays a biography under it. The problem is when it does this, it leaves a big blank space where the photo was instead of adjusting the position of the other photos.
[07:52:33] <barryhjames> If you click on "Deb Debenport," and then scroll down the page, you'll see what I mean.
[07:52:42] <doug65536> juboba: if you really need all that document ready stuff, an iframe would do that. you would set the src of it to that url. what's inside it will act like a full blown web page
[07:54:53] <barryhjames> I know it is doing it because some of the names are too long, and I need to clear the first photo in each line with CSS, but because the jQuery still considers the photo that was moved to be part of the order, it doesn't reorder the rest of the photos. Does that make sense?
[07:55:28] <doug65536> juboba: if you had a script tag near the bottom of the thing that gets loaded, I think it will run when it is "ready". not sure though
[07:56:08] <doug65536> juboba: I vaguely remember scripts getting stripped out, but I'm not sure if I'm confusing it with something else
[07:58:03] <juboba> doug65536, I tried that
[07:58:22] <jned> $('<p/>').text is a sortcut to .text("<p>"+yourstring+"</p>"); ?
[07:58:24] <doug65536> juboba: maybe if I knew more details I could give a more specific answer
[07:58:39] <doug65536> jned: no, the first one is secure, the 2nd one is a security hole
[07:59:00] <juboba> doug65536, I'll define a on_readyfunction in the LOADED part and I
[07:59:03] <doug65536> jned: also, & and < could cause major problems
[07:59:23] <juboba> doug65536, I'll define a 'on_ready' function in the LOADED part and I will execute that function from the parent
[07:59:24] <doug65536> jned: oh! sorry
[07:59:45] <jned> ?
[08:00:03] <doug65536> jned: yeah I see what you were saying. this should clear it up:
[08:00:31] <jned> in the script you  made, I never knew you could do that
[08:00:36] <doug65536> jned: $('<p/>').text('something')       <-- creates a document fragment containing a 'p' tag, and sets the content of the 'p' to the text
[08:01:06] <doug65536> jned: .text securely escapes < > & etc, so it will always work correctly
[08:01:07] <jned> doug65536, thx
[08:02:04] <doug65536> jned: the "security hole" is when you are putting user-entered text on the page. a malicious user could type in <script src="www.malicioussite.com/evil.js"></script> and run code on every visitors browser
[08:02:42] <jned> doug65536, when I view the page, I see all the weather data, but I was expecting to see it in the source too, but its not there
[08:02:56] <jned> doug65536, thx for the security advise
[08:03:03] <doug65536> jned: so if you didn't know what you were doing, and used .html you would end up putting that malicious user's script on your page
[08:03:49] <doug65536> jned: in what source
[08:04:04] <doug65536> jned: view source on your page? view source won't change
[08:04:12] <jned> doug65536, well, I fun the $.get script and get the weather data
[08:04:12] <doug65536> jned: use the elements debugger. press F12
[08:04:19] <jned> doug65536, ok
[08:04:27] <Mrgoose2> With Jquery Mobile is it possible to make the side panel independently scroll?  I have a menu in my slide panel and i need to be able to scroll up and down
[08:04:46] <jned> doug65536, yep, there it is, thx again
[08:05:10] <xrosnight> hello guys
[08:05:35] <xrosnight> anyone knows any free API about how to pick up WHOIS???
[08:05:41] <sonja> does ajax have a "listen" mode... where jquery waits for a json file from the php server?
[08:06:05] <sonja> would it be a post... and then wait a minute to receive, if required?
[08:06:20] <doug65536> xrosnight: free? no. pay services exist
[08:06:43] <xrosnight> what API doug65536
[08:06:58] <doug65536> xrosnight: typically it would be an ajax request that gets xml
[08:07:12] <doug65536> or json
[08:07:30] <doug65536> so, no api really, you just use $.get and pass appropriate data
[08:07:39] <xrosnight> doug65536:  yeah
[08:07:59] <xrosnight> doug65536: but where is the URL then for json
[08:08:24] <doug65536> xrosnight: whatever service you use would provide that
[08:08:41] <Ziber> Is anyone familiar with the sortable plugin able to tell me why initializing it with items: "> ul li:not(.someclass):not(.orAnother)" does not let me sort the items?
[08:08:46] <juboba> doug65536, if I try $('#div').load(url, on_ready) it tells me on_ready is not defined
[08:09:02] <juboba> doug65536, I defined an on_ready function in the loaded page
[08:09:07] <juboba> doug65536, any ideas?
[08:09:34] <xrosnight> doug65536:  shall we find it on godaddy ?
[08:09:42] <jned> doug65536, how'd you figure out how to write that script.  I want to selectively display data, and I also supply icons for different weather conditions, so I would need to find a list of all possibilities so I can have an icon for each
[08:11:48] <doug65536> jned: how'd I figure out which part? I looked at the xml to find the "entry title" thing. my selector means, find every "title" that is under an "entry"
[08:12:57] <jned> doug65536, thx, do you mind also giving me a quick/simple explanation of corsproxy, I read the website but maybe your explanation might help some more
[08:13:17] <doug65536> jned: for icons, I don't see any data in the xml that is in a perfect format for determining that. I would suggest looking for specific words in the string
[08:13:50] <jned> doug65536, yeah, like sunny is easy, if it says sunny I can show an icon for that
[08:14:00] <doug65536> jned: cross-domain ajax requests are blocked by your browser, unless the response says it is ok to do a cross domain request
[08:14:40] <jned> doug65536, yeah, but I am confused, how isn't then using cdn's crossbroswer too
[08:14:44] <doug65536> jned: www.corsproxy.com does the request for you, and it doesn't care if it says cross domain is ok or not. then it sends it to your browser, and tells your browser that cross-domain is ok
[08:14:47] <Ziber> Any people here familiar with sortable mind helping me figure out why specifying items to sort is having trouble.
[08:15:03] <doug65536> jned: you are allowed to get scripts cross-domain
[08:16:16] <jned> doug65536, oh the difference is, one is a get request, and other is ajax.  cross-domain get is allowed, but cross-domain ajax is restricted for security, right?
[08:16:27] <doug65536> jned: no. get requests are ajax
[08:16:55] <jned> you mean ajax requests are get requests
[08:17:16] <jned> not the $.get, I mean http get
[08:17:23] <doug65536> jned: well, not necessarily GET requests, it can be POST or HEAD, etc
[08:17:31] <tedster> Hi, http://www.smartload.eu/My/ can someone explain why the background gradient stops after content stops?
[08:17:41] <tedster> ugly and pointless imo
[08:17:51] <doug65536> jned: "ajax" is when a script asks the browser to do a request
[08:18:15] <NoiseEee> juboba: if that function is in the document being loaded, then you'll need to access it that way
[08:18:40] <doug65536> jned: it is a (kind of stupid) acronym: asynchronous javascript and xml
[08:18:57] <doug65536> jned: it was invented when xml was "cool"
[08:18:58] <NoiseEee> juboba: also, you can't load a document into a <div> but whatever
[08:19:01] <jned> doug65536, oh I see, so browsers can do cross-domain requests, but scripts are restricted
[08:19:14] <jned> doug65536, xml is dying out?
[08:19:26] <doug65536> jned: no, but ajax has nothing to do with xml
[08:19:47] <tedster> its this god damn ui panel
[08:19:47] <tedster> :P
[08:19:53] <jned> oh ok, I see what you mean, the X is there just cause of all the xml hympe back then
[08:19:55] <doug65536> jned: ajwc would have made sense: asynchronous javascript web request
[08:20:17] <doug65536> r
[08:20:29] <doug65536> ajwr doesn't roll off the tongue though :)
[08:20:47] <doug65536> yes
[08:20:59] <jned> its all websockets in a year or two eh
[08:21:51] <doug65536> jned: well, websockets only add value if you need to keep a bidirectional communication channel open, where each side can send more at any time. it's not likely to replace ajax though
[08:22:02] <juboba> NoiseEee, no?
[08:22:07] <juboba> NoiseEee, what should it be?
[08:22:26] <doug65536> jned: the internet is still based around a "give me this" model
[08:22:27] <NoiseEee> juboba: you can't load a document within a document, unless you're talking about iframes.
[08:22:32] <jned> doug65536, yeah, if you dont need it, it would be overhead
[08:23:01] <jned> if you need bi-directional talk, then use it, but otherwise its overhead
[08:23:41] <juboba> NoiseEee, the jQuery load function allow you to load content in any element
[08:24:00] <doug65536> jned: POST = here, take this unlimited amount of data, and reply to me if you want, and bypass the cache, GET = take these parameters and tell me what it gives me, cache is ok
[08:24:05] <NoiseEee> juboba: well try doing stuff after makign the DOM totally invalid.
[08:24:58] <jned> doug65536, what/where is the cache exactly
[08:25:50] <doug65536> jned: the browser stashes a copy of all the requests you do, if you repeat the exact same request, it can just ask the server if it has changed since then, and if the server says it hasn't you can skip the download - your browser already has it stored in the cache
[08:26:17] <jned> doug65536, oh yeah, I noticed that
[08:26:59] <jned> doug65536, thx
[08:27:09] <doug65536> np
[08:27:20] <juboba> NoiseEee, but my response is not an html page but a partial
[08:27:34] <juboba> NoiseEee, my DOM is still valid
[08:28:20] <BillCriswell> Why do I feel like an idiot when I try to read coffeescript?
[08:28:22] <doug65536> tedster: where did min-height 300px come from?
[08:28:31] <NoiseEee> juboba: okay, and you're including a function in that response as well?
[08:28:56] <juboba> NoiseEee, yes, under a <script> tag
[08:29:15] <doug65536> juboba: it's a chicked and egg problem. it prepare to call a funciton that doesn't exist yet
[08:29:30] <tedster> doug65536: no idea
[08:29:39] <doug65536> juboba:  it can't*
[08:29:42] <tedster> thats something that happends to the sibling of the panel element i think
[08:29:45] <tedster> because i never defined it
[08:30:22] <NoiseEee> juboba: not really an ideal set-up by any means.
[08:30:36] <juboba> NoiseEee, suggestion?
[08:30:44] <NoiseEee> change your approach if you can.
[08:30:55] <juboba> NoiseEee, to what?
[08:31:12] <NoiseEee> juboba: the idea of sending back a javascript function to execute amidst other data
[08:32:29] <doug65536> tedster: I never use gradients. no browsers use dithering, so you get heavy banding artifacts
[08:32:51] <doug65536> tedster: but that's beside the point, can you css it to min-height 100%?
[08:34:22] <jned> doug65536, is doug your real name by chance, and are you located in Ontario?
[08:34:26] <juboba> NoiseEee, doug65536 I've never worked this way before. I want to load just partials of my application through ajax to reduce the server load
[08:34:30] <doug65536> jned: yes, yes
[08:34:37] <tedster> doug65536:  i tried, and no
[08:34:39] <jned> doug65536, hamilton?
[08:34:44] <doug65536> jned: oshawa
[08:34:56] <jedimind> im in toronto
[08:34:57] <jned> doug65536, ever lived or worked in Hamilton?
[08:34:57] <d21> hi. how can i append data to localStorage? is it possible?
[08:34:59] <jedimind> but my name is not doug
[08:35:06] <jedimind> canada represent?
[08:35:08] <jned> jedimind, haha
[08:35:13] <jned> canada!
[08:35:13] <doug65536> \o/
[08:35:38] <doug65536> jned: I haven't
[08:35:42] <jned> 36 M Hamilton
[08:35:47] <jedimind> haha
[08:35:57] <doug65536> d21: of course you can. you mean append to a key?
[08:36:18] <doug65536> d21: er, the value stored under a key
[08:36:21] <d21> i want to put multiple elements to localstorage and get them at once
[08:36:35] <doug65536> d21: define "elements"
[08:36:36] <jned> doug65536, there was an IT tech named Dough who used to work where I work, and we are picking up a lot of his code so I thought I'd just ...I knew it was a long shot
[08:36:47] <jedimind> earth
[08:36:47] <jedimind> fire
[08:36:48] <jedimind> water
[08:36:59] <BillCriswell> You forgot wind.
[08:37:12] <doug65536> jned: no, I haven't worked in hamilton
[08:37:23] <jedimind> air benders are mostly extinct though, so they slipped my mind
[08:37:54] <doug65536> d21: text?
[08:38:04] <jned> doug65536, ok so its a different Doug, hehe
[08:38:18] <d21> text
[08:38:30] <jedimind> there is more than one doug in ontario?
[08:38:34] <jedimind> well now ive seen everything
[08:38:36] <jned> so everyone is corsproxy for rss feeds?
[08:39:04] <jned> jedimind, yeah I know, hehe, it was silly of me to think he might be the same Doug
[08:39:11] <doug65536> d21: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage#localStorage
[08:39:46] <jned> my boss loves the old Doug, be he quit
[08:40:04] <doug65536> d21: note that that block of code there is just a simulation of localStorage - to give you an idea of what it does
[08:40:43] <d21> ok ill have a look thanks
[08:42:51] <NoiseEee> juboba: thats fine, but why are you loading scripts to be executed via JS?
[08:42:57] <NoiseEee> juboba: content is one thing...
[08:43:08] <doug65536> d21: wow, I'm looking at some localStorage "tutorials". they all make it look 10x harder than it really is...
[08:43:35] <juboba> NoiseEee, because I don't know other way
[08:44:34] <NoiseEee> juboba: well its the same page/app, so define the function as part of the script of the main page/app
[08:44:35] <Abhay> hi everyone....anybody there?
[08:44:35] <doug65536> d21: localStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myvalue')   or   localStorage.getItem('myKey'). note that you can also JSON.encode or JSON.decode to store js objects in there
[08:45:07] <rumpel> which browsers do support localStorage?
[08:45:18] <doug65536> `caniuse localStorage
[08:45:20] <b-ot> doug65536: You can use Web Storage - name/value pairs with: Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, Safari 4, Opera 10.5, iOS Safari 3.2, and Opera Mobile 11. http://caniuse.com/#search=namevalue-storage
[08:45:47] <juboba> NoiseEee, I'm changing my app from standard php to a more ajaxy fashion
[08:46:04] <NoiseEee> juboba: fine
[08:46:05] <juboba> NoiseEee, I don't want to have all the scripts possible loaded beforehand
[08:46:26] <NoiseEee> juboba: ask yourself if you're doing it because it will enhance the user experience, or just because you want to do it
[08:47:06] <juboba> NoiseEee, I want to do it mainly to lower the server load
[08:47:28] <NoiseEee> juboba: well if the user is hitting the server for each script/content is it really reducing server load?
[08:47:46] <d21> doug65536 thanks
[08:47:51] <juboba> NoiseEee, yes, because my sidebar is very heavy to calculate
[08:48:03] <juboba> NoiseEee, it does heavy queries
[08:48:09] <juboba> to database
[08:48:16] <d21> im trying to append multiple text values to localstorage
[08:48:21] <d21> seems like it takes only one value
[08:48:27] <juboba> so it is much faster to load the sidebar just once
[08:48:31] <NoiseEee> juboba: well if thats where your issue is, why not focus on more efficient queries / data?
[08:49:04] <juboba> NoiseEee, not possible to change that
[08:50:31] <NoiseEee> juboba: look, load the scripts you're going to use in your app/page when your app/page loads.  concat and minify if you like.  or you can load scripts indivdually when needed... but you can't send back data and JS to execute in an ajax response.
[08:52:42] <NoiseEee> juboba: but imo i'd focus on optimizing the right thing, and that appears to be your DB queries.
[08:53:30] <shafox> hi, while doing $.ajax({url: <?php echo BASE_URL; ?>}) it raises syntax error on this "<" . how to overcome this ?
[08:53:51] <juboba> NoiseEee, the queries are fine, the heavy thing are the tables. I have to check logs that may have thousands of entries
[08:54:16] <BillCriswell> shafox: Your php doesn't seem to be parsing. You also don't have quotes around the url.
[08:54:47] <skpp> hi, I want to select all textareas and input from a div#form-editor *except* those that are contained within a div.template. I've got this but it doesn't work as intended: $('#form-editor textarea, #form-editor input, #form-editor select, :not(div.template)')
[08:55:01] <shafox> BillCriswell: do i have to put quotes around url? like this $.ajax({"url": <?php ?>}) ??
[08:56:55] <NoiseEee> juboba: again, the issue is the DB.  indexing, retreiving info, ways to make the DB part more efficient.  re-doing your app to avoid loading a sidebar that calls the offending functionality is a neat workaroud, but it is a workaround and is not solving the real problem of your app.  but good luck!
[08:57:09] <skpp> nevermind, div.template has display:none so $('#form-editor textarea:visible, #form-editor input:visible, #form-editor select:visible') works. is there a more concise way to express that?
[08:57:35] <BillCriswell> shafox: No. Around <?php echo BASE_URL ?>
[08:57:55] <Mrgoose2> With Jquery Mobile is it possible to make the side panel independently scroll?  I have a menu in my slide panel and i need to be able to scroll up and down
[08:58:00] <shafox> ok BillCriswell thanks
[08:58:11] <BillCriswell> shafox: I think your PHP isn't parsing. IF you view source do you see <?php echo BASE_URL ?> or do you see http://baseurl.com ?
[08:58:29] <juboba> NoiseEee, I also have a chat in my app, with a node.js server. That works neat as long as the user stays in a page. When the user reloads or changes pages I have to reconnect to the chat server, so this is another big reason.
[08:59:00] <shafox> BillCriswell: I am seeing <?php ?>
[08:59:16] <shafox> Yeah its not parsing. I have to call the function name to render the json data
[09:00:14] <BillCriswell> shafox: Sounds good.
[09:03:13] <juboba> NoiseEee, another question, is it possible to create a jqueryui dialog exclusively from javascript?
[09:08:28] <Mrgoose2> Anyone seen this error in jquery 1.4 beta? Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined
[09:08:37] <Mrgoose2> wrong channel
[09:14:13] <knuth> Any lawnchair users?
[09:17:17] <ThemNuts> hi guys
[09:18:29] <ThemNuts> i got a radio group that i want to add to the total. it works but when i change the selection it adds the second value aswell instead of replacing it. Don't know if this makes sense. the sollution i have in mind is probably way to far fetched but im not a jquery guy
[09:18:35] <ThemNuts> http://jsfiddle.net/cse_tushar/d2xpc/
[09:18:57] <ThemNuts> the thing is that the actual radio doesn't have the value i need, its in a td next to it.
[09:19:28] <ThemNuts> i got a couple of these groups and a select. the select works but can't get the radio's to work properly
[09:23:13] <niix> Hello, I'm using jQuery validation and on my form submit it is only highlighting the first errored field and not all of the `required` ones.  Anyone have any idea what this may be?
[09:25:12] <rumpel> niix, need more data
[09:25:50] <niix> rumpel: can you expound on that?
[09:26:25] <ThemNuts> niix show an example of your code on jsfiddle.net
[09:26:28] <ThemNuts> is what he means

[09:30:26] <niix> ThemNuts: ok thanks :)
[09:32:16] <xinming> Hi, WHen we use .on, Is it possible to bind multiple selectors?
[09:32:39] <xinming> for example, $('dom').on('click', '.class1 a, .class2 a', function (e) { blabla });

[09:53:12] <LoneSoldier728> has anyone here work with fetchmail or backing up emails locally
[09:56:18] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: that doesn't sound like a question for jquery...
[09:57:13] <tacajushi> hello, can you help me with this? https://gist.github.com/dolohow/b9d71d7fd2fadda3f74e
[09:57:56] <LoneSoldier728> sorry cork
[09:58:01] <Cork> tacajushi: you're trying to assign a value to a function call
[09:58:02] <LoneSoldier728> where should i talk about this
[09:58:24] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: no clue, check for a community for fetchmail
[09:58:55] <Cork> tacajushi: what you doing is similar to function some() {} some() = "hello"
[09:59:29] <tacajushi> Cork: ok, so what can I do about it?
[09:59:40] <Cork> tacajushi: what are you trying to do?
[09:59:40] <tacajushi> what is the simplest way to clone jquery object
[09:59:48] <Cork> none of those lines makes any sense
[09:59:54] <Cork> $().clone()
[10:00:16] <Cork> tacajushi: that clones the dom elements though
[10:00:21] <tacajushi> well, I changing the values of cells in tables after document is ready and then then someomes hit the 'h' button on keyboard the values of cells should be restored
[10:00:23] <Cork> not the jquery object
[10:00:46] <Cork> ya, .clone() sounds like what you want
[10:01:40] <Cork> var cloned = $('.gridDane').clone(); $('.gridDane').replaceWith(cloned.clone())
[10:01:47] <Cork> opps no that won't work
[10:02:04] <Cork> tacajushi: do you have a container for this?
[10:02:17] <Cork> like is it all the rows in the tbody?
[10:02:50] <tacajushi> Cork: just have a look at that script, it's the first revision of it https://gist.github.com/dolohow/6713383
[10:03:08] <aitiba> hi
[10:03:14] <Cork> tacajushi: the script doesn't tell me the structure of the html
[10:04:04] <tacajushi> well I've got <tr>'s with class="gridDane"
[10:04:10] <tacajushi> and <tbody> of course
[10:04:33] <Cork> tacajushi: is the tr's with the class all the rows in the tbody?
[10:05:09] <Cork> interesting...
[10:06:01] <aitiba> why having this html and jquery each, I dont see any alert message? http://pastebin.com/r3medBTH
[10:06:12] <aitiba> any errors too
[10:06:34] <Cork> aitiba: don't put tag names infront of your id's
[10:07:05] <Cork> it isn't the cause, but it is bad for a selector
[10:07:30] <Cork> aitiba: when it the script running?
[10:07:32] <tacajushi> Cork: i was kicked due to spam, but I did var cloned = $('.gridDane').clone(); $('.gridDane').replaceWith(cloned.clone()); and it works well, thanks :)
[10:07:57] <Cork> tacajushi: replaceWith should not work, cause you should get a lot of duplicates
[10:08:20] <Cork> you should get a set of cloned for each .gridDane in the page
[10:08:21] <tacajushi> Cork: but it does in fact ;)
[10:08:39] <tacajushi> Cork: I undestand why shouldn't but it's working
[10:09:16] <aitiba> Cork: you say that use $("#homeslider li a img") instead of $("ul#homeslider li a img") right?
[10:09:45] <Cork> aitiba: yes, cause right now you select all ul's in the page, and then filter the list based on the id hash
[10:09:51] <Cork> and that is a waist of performance
[10:10:16] <Cork> aitiba: but like i said, it isn't the cause of the problem
[10:10:19] <Cork> just a sidenote
[10:10:40] <Cork> aitiba: when it the script running? <-- the cause is most likely this
[10:10:56] <Cork> *when is the
[10:11:30] <Cork> js> var square = x => x * x; print(square(5))
[10:11:36] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[10:11:44] <Cork> hmm sad
[10:12:04] <aitiba> I have this jquery after <script type="text/javascript"> tags Cork
[10:12:19] <Cork> aitiba: ok, and where is the script tag?
[10:12:24] <Cork> in head?
[10:12:27] <Cork> or?
[10:12:27] <aitiba> on a html file
[10:12:31] <Cork> heh
[10:12:32] <aitiba> in head
[10:12:36] <Cork> ok
[10:12:40] <Cork> ?api ready
[10:12:40] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[10:12:50] <Cork> you need to wrap you script in that call ^
[10:13:02] <Cork> $(function() {}); is a shorthand for the same thing
[10:13:17] <Cork> add that around your call and it should work fine
[10:14:27] <aitiba> Cork: I have a jQuery(function($){ after the code that I pasted, but I put an alert inside jQuery(function($){ I dont see the alert on that page
[10:14:50] <Cork> aitiba: do you have a link?
[10:16:15] <aitiba> http://95.16.186.241/prestafinal
[10:16:59] <Cork> ehh, it tries to access localhost...
[10:17:04] <Cork> :)
[10:17:06] <aitiba> ways
[10:17:08] <aitiba> wait
[10:18:55] <aitiba> Cork: try now. give some f5
[10:20:38] <Cork> aitiba: to start of, use console.log for debugging not alert
[10:20:46] <Cork> also $() always returns an object
[10:20:52] <Cork> so you need to check $().length
[10:24:28] <Cork> aitiba: you have an error from a missing library in custom.js, i THINK that is why your code is not working
[10:24:43] <Cork> (btw another sidenote, you have two doctypes at the top of the page)
[10:25:51] <jned> you know weather apps, how do you get a list of all the different weather conditions, like 'party cloudy', 'mostly sunny', 'scattered rain'? so that you can make a list of corresponding icons
[10:26:16] <Cork> aitiba: also i recommend running the page through w3c validate you have a few errors there to handle
[10:27:32] <aitiba> Cork: which is the library you is missing? autocomplete.js?
[10:27:56] <Cork> aitiba: check your error console
[10:31:19] <nhulea> I was trying to filter out some items of an array but it keeps replacing the removed items with next one that was there is there any way to just remove the items without replacing it with the preceding value ?
[10:32:20] <Cork> nhulea: arrays is a continuing list of values, there can't be holes in it
[10:32:57] <lacrymology> there was a way to do "run this code whenever an element that responds to this selector is added" (as in oposed to "elements that already exist").. can someone remind me what it was?
[10:33:22] <Cork> ?api delegate
[10:33:22] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:33:31] <Cork> you can also use ?api on
[10:33:36] <Cork> ?api on
[10:33:36] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:33:49] <Cork> (read the page BEFORE using on)
[10:35:47] <lacrymology> Cork: I don't understand how .on helps with elements that don't yet exist
[10:36:12] <Cork> lacrymology: what you talk about is the bind syntax for on
[10:36:28] <Cork> lacrymology: on is a combo function that is why i said to read the page
[10:36:35] <Cork> delegate is another syntax for on
[10:36:40] <Cork> and THAT is what you want
[10:37:21] <lacrymology> Cork: ah, yes, I know 'on' =). Do you know if there's a list of events anywhere? is there a 'created' event, or similar?
[10:37:35] * Cork starts to really hate on cause of it beeing so hard to explain for developers...
[10:37:56] <Cork> lacrymology: no there isn't any dom modifications events
[10:38:08] <Cork> ?mdn event types
[10:38:08] <b-ot> Cork: event.type - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.type
[10:38:26] <Cork> bah
[10:39:17] <Cork> lacrymology: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Event#DOM_event_subclasses
[10:40:02] <Cork> is a fairly exhaustive list of events
[10:40:12] <lacrymology> THANK YOU
[10:40:14] <lacrymology> =)
[10:40:18] <Cork> lacrymology: there are a few jquery specific events
[10:40:26] <Cork> you will find them in api.jquery.com
[10:40:49] <Cork> like mouseenter/mouseleave and a few like that
[10:42:12] <nhulea> Cork:so maybe I should php to filter it out before it even gets to the js probably
[10:42:46] <Cork> nhulea: i can't even answer that, too little information
[10:45:34] <lacrymology> hm, there doesn't seem to be a 'creation' event, or anything that can be used for that
[10:45:41] <nhulea> Cork:  I have an array that from php that is creating a list of values that catergorize calendar entries then I use jquery to create a calendar that shows those calendar entries based off the criteria I am adding 2 more categories and removing 2 so I was trying to preserve the data of the 2 I am removing by just hiding them
[10:45:56] <Cork> lacrymology: like i said, there isn't any events for dom modifications
[10:46:13] <Cork> lacrymology: events is for user interactions, not for tracking scripts
[10:46:26] <Cork> lacrymology: at least the ones the browser provides
[10:47:13] <Cork> nhulea: there are many ways you could solve this
[10:47:41] <Cork> you could for example set null or undefined for the point in the list you don't want it in
[10:47:58] <Cork> though that will technically be a point in the list
[10:48:14] <Cork> or you could use objects instead of an array
[10:48:26] <Cork> though that will lost some of the functions from arrays
[10:49:31] <jned> where the heck is the rss icon http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/canada/ontario/hamilton it says it supposed to be there but I can't find it http://past.theweathernetwork.com/rss/
[10:50:41] <Cork> jned: no icon but check the foot
[10:52:36] <nhulea> Cork: this gives me undefined instead of removing them http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/CKuCy/ could I just hide the undefined ?
[10:53:06] <Cork> nhulea: didn't you just say you wanted to keep the space in the list?
[10:53:36] <Cork> nhulea: never ever use [] in assigning values to an array
[10:53:38] <Cork> use .push()
[10:53:53] <nhulea> Cork: yeah I do but I also dont want the this to come up <img src=undefined/>
[10:54:16] <Cork> nhulea: then you have to handle if the value is undefined
[10:54:24] <Cork> or stop using arrays
[10:55:06] <Cork> though if you stop using arrays you can't use splice
[10:55:08] <nhulea> that what I was saying above I was just going to hide () if == undefined
[10:55:29] <nhulea> would that work ?
[10:55:33] <Cork> ya
[10:55:40] <nhulea> ok let me see
[10:55:44] <Cork> a cleaner option would prob be to have a second array
[10:55:50] <Cork> with elements not to show
[10:56:05] <Cork> and if index exist in the array skip it
[10:56:27] <Cork> or use objects in the array
[10:56:35] <Cork> [{},{},{}]
[10:56:42] <Cork> and have the index in the object
[10:56:51] <Cork> and just ignore the index of the array
[10:57:01] <Cork> (would prob be my solution)
[10:58:25] <nhulea> Ive never check 2 arrys against each other do you have an example ? thanks
[11:00:09] <jned> Cork, it just links back to the instructions for rss
[11:04:12] <Cork> jned: ex http://rss.theweathernetwork.com/weather/cabc0308
[11:04:27] <Cork> it is in the footer like the text says
[11:04:27] <jned> Cork, how did you find that?
[11:05:03] <jned> Cork, my brain is shit, I still can't find it
[11:06:22] <Cork> jned: you first go to the site you want weather from
[11:06:29] <Cork> and then look in the footer
[11:06:31] <jned> done
[11:06:38] <jned> http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/canada/ontario/hamilton
[11:06:49] <jned> blue background footer,
[11:07:19] <jned> 1 row 5 cols and another row below it
[11:08:13] <Cork> jned: there isn't one for that location
[11:08:43] <jned> oooooooh, ok, so I'm not blind, thank God
[11:08:59] <jned> Cork, what location did you check?
[11:09:00] <Cork> jned: ex. http://past.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caab2122
[11:09:09] <Cork> jned: i just picked a random one :)
[11:09:22] <Bloomberg> guys I'm trying to join a channel and it show me I need to join like host
[11:09:25] <Bloomberg> how is that?
[11:09:38] <Cork> "like host"?
[11:10:32] <Cork> Bloomberg: can you show the exact message?
[11:10:46] <Cork> (also you might be better of asking in #freenode)
[11:15:19] <jned> There isn't one for Toronto either
[11:15:48] <jned> Cork, what city did you search?
[11:16:38] <Cork> jned: i didn't i used http://past.theweathernetwork.com/navindex/forecastsindex/
[11:18:25] <jned> Cork, that helped, looks like there is an old and new site running
[11:18:46] <adrian_berg> for this simple html, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=XYKemAaA $('li') returns the first list item, however, $('li').each(function(){console.log(1)}) returns "TypeError: Object #<HTMLLIElement> has no method 'each'"
[11:18:50] <adrian_berg> why is this?
[11:19:00] <krambiorix> how can i change a date format from 27/09/2013 to 2013-09-27   ?
[11:19:07] <Bloomberg> #php Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
[11:19:36] <Bloomberg> Crok : this is the msg that it show me when I trying to enter to  that channel
[11:19:38] <Cork> adrian_berg: sounds like you arn't using jquery
[11:19:51] <Cork> Bloomberg: ##php not #php
[11:20:21] <Cork> Bloomberg: single # is normally for the group or organization
[11:20:21] <adrian_berg> Cork: the script tag is on the page, maybe i should add http://
[11:20:25] <Cork> ## is for the community
[11:20:34] <adrian_berg> that worked
[11:20:44] <Bloomberg> cork : now it show me this :: ##php Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[11:21:04] <adrian_berg> why wouldn't         <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[11:21:07] <adrian_berg>  work?
[11:21:24] <Cork> Bloomberg: you need to register your nick
[11:21:34] <Cork> Bloomberg: check /ns help register
[11:21:44] <Cork> Bloomberg: and ask in #freenode if you don't know what to do
[11:22:08] <Cork> adrian_berg: is your current protocol http or https?
[11:22:23] <Cork> if no then you know why
[11:22:43] <adrian_berg> if not http, then i know why? okay.
[11:22:57] <adrian_berg> i wonder if https everywhere is the issue
[11:23:11] <Cork> adrian_berg: // means "use my current protocol"
[11:23:22] <Cork> adrian_berg: no
[11:23:23] <adrian_berg> should it be https or http?
[11:23:31] <Cork> adrian_berg: depends on what you want
[11:23:54] <adrian_berg> okay, since it's a local file, it isn't using http or https, there's the issue
[11:23:54] <Cork> if your site is http or https you use // to make sure the script is loaded with the same protocol
[11:24:03] <Cork> if you load from ex. file your need to specify it
[11:24:14] <adrian_berg> /home/adrian/file.html is how i'm loading the test file
[11:24:14] <b-ot> adrian_berg: memorised home/adrian/file.html.
[11:24:20] <Cork> adrian_berg: also that said, you should not use local files
[11:24:20] <jned> doug65536, it does seem to work with the theweathernetwork rss: http://rss.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0289
[11:24:21] <NoiseEee> herp
[11:24:28] <adrian_berg> Cork: why is that?
[11:24:38] <blackmesa> Hi all. I wanted to show() and hide() a div when a form checkbox is clicked. Is this a good approach? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9327363ac7d9fa2bfde7 thx for feedback
[11:24:49] <Cork> adrian_berg: cause the web isn't built to work from that scope
[11:25:14] <Cork> adrian_berg: you won't have correct headers for one, and there is lots of other caveats too
[11:25:27] <Cork> adrian_berg: get a small webserver and use that on localhost instead
[11:26:17] <adrian_berg> that's a good idea Cork, thanks for suggesting it
[11:26:31] <Cork> blackmesa: it's ok but you can just do $().toggle(this.checked)
[11:27:00] * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with Cork
[11:27:01] <Cork> and skip all the if/else lines
[11:27:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> blackmesa: next time make a jsfiddle
[11:27:48] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: why ctcp?!?
[11:28:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: ???
[11:28:35] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: you sent a ctcp line to the channel instead of a normal action message
[11:28:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ctcp?
[11:29:01] <Cork> ?g irc ctcp
[11:29:02] <b-ot> Cork: CTCP - IRChelp  http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html
[11:29:20] <Cork> looks like your client is a bit messed up
[11:29:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> which line
[11:29:28] <Cork> * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with Cork <--
[11:29:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[11:29:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause on my side its fine
[11:30:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> i typed "/ me" (without space) and then the message
[11:30:04] <Cork> well the network sent a ctcp to the channel instead of a normal msg action
[11:30:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry not as familiar with irc tech lingo
[11:30:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> englsih please
[11:30:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> *english
[11:30:43] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: you client is using wrong commands for /me
[11:31:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> im using chatzilla
[11:31:06] <Cork> ugg...
[11:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> on win7
[11:31:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> any alternative you suggest
[11:31:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is simple
[11:31:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> and minimalistic
[11:31:28] <MaSOuD> It was an action message
[11:31:34] <MaSOuD> how did you see that as a CTCP?
[11:32:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: see what i mean
[11:32:15] <Cork> MaSOuD: * CTCP: Rohan_Bhangui [ACTION agrees with Cork] to [#jquery]
[11:32:36] <MaSOuD> Cork: I guess your client is messed up
[11:32:47] <Cork> MaSOuD: no, my client is just fine
[11:32:54] <Cork> ctcp isn't meant for actions
[11:32:58] <MaSOuD> No it's not. Because it was just an action message
[11:33:07] <Cork> check the raw message
[11:33:18] <jned> the theweathernetwork feed doesn't seem to be xml I guess: http://jsfiddle.net/cHbvv/5/
[11:33:21] <Cork> that is from logging
[11:33:35] <MaSOuD> Cork: What client are you using?
[11:33:46] <Cork> MaSOuD: the logging is done by znc
[11:33:53] <blackmesa> Cork: thx but I dont really know how you meant it http://jsfiddle.net/34zzL/
[11:33:57] <Cork> and yes it warns when i get ctcp sent
[11:34:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> blackmesa: i got this
[11:34:08] <MaSOuD> Then the ZNC is messed up. It was just an action message without any CTCPs
[11:34:21] <Cork> MaSOuD: no it's not
[11:34:29] <MaSOuD> lol
[11:34:49] <Cork> MaSOuD: do you even check the raw data?
[11:34:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> blackmesa: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/34zzL/1/
[11:34:53] <Cork> most users don't
[11:35:34] <MaSOuD> Cork: I'm an mSL scripter, so I know what I'm talking about
[11:35:37] <Cork> MaSOuD: * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with Cork <-- this isn't the raw data, it's the parsed and outouted one
[11:35:47] <Cork> MaSOuD: so do i
[11:35:59] <blackmesa> Rohan_Bhangui: oh so easy? thank u both Cork
[11:36:01] <MaSOuD> OK, you win.
[11:36:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> blackmesa: yes its that easy
[11:36:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: how oges it
[11:36:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> *goes
[11:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> MaSOuD, Cork: whos right?
[11:38:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> im confused
[11:38:33] <Cork> who cares...
[11:46:30] <Kaylors> The .toPrecision() method formats a number to a specific number of digits. So 8 becomes 8.0. What do I do to make 8 become 08?
[11:47:39] <Cork> (variable / 100).toPrecision(2)
[11:47:51] <Cork> ah no
[11:47:55] <Cork> you want padding
[11:48:08] <Cork> Kaylors: js don't provide tools to zero pad
[11:48:23] <Cork> simplest is to do something like
[11:48:53] <Kaylors> Cork: Write my own function for it?
[11:49:26] <Cork> js> var num = 8, padding = '000000000'; print(padding.slice(0, 3 - num.toString().length));
[11:49:30] <Cork> bah
[11:49:32] <b-ot> Cork: 00
[11:49:39] <Cork> js> var num = 8, padding = '000000000'; print(padding.slice(0, 3 - num.toString().length) + num);
[11:49:45] <b-ot> Cork: 008
[11:50:39] <Kaylors> Alright, thank you :)
[11:50:45] <Cork> np
[11:51:14] <Cork> Kaylors: and yes, a function would be nice to keep the code clean
[11:51:40] <Cork> though it almost a one liner :)
[11:58:05] <Kaylors> Okay, next problem. Its a bit of a doozy (for me, anyway).
[11:58:48] <Kaylors> Okay, so I need to create a system for entering items in a list. Each list item will consist of four fields: size, mass, color, price.
[11:59:43] <Kaylors> Now I made four fields for the four items and used a script to add the fields to a form.
[11:59:50] <Kaylors> And then I submit the form.
[12:00:08] <Kaylors> But what I cant seem to be able to do is write a script to remove any particular field.
[12:00:43] <Kaylors> I grouped each set of four fields in a div and added a 'x' span with a click event to remove that particular div.
[12:00:50] <Kaylors> Hang on, I'll put it in a fiddle.
[12:01:02] <Cork> Kaylors: i think i know what the problem is
[12:01:38] <Cork> Kaylors: if your event listener is added directly to the elements, it will only work on the elements that exist in the dom when the listener is added
[12:01:43] <blackmesa> I use this function to reset form data after submit. but it doesnt work for radio button/checkboxes. http://jsfiddle.net/Rt5VX/ any suggestions?
[12:01:50] <Cork> Kaylors: so you want delegated event listeners
[12:02:16] <Cork> blackmesa: you run reset on the form, not the fields
[12:02:31] <HenryCH> Hi guys, I have exactly this in my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Eqjb8/  but for some reason it's not working as it does in the fiddle, it just takes me to the href page.. any ideas what could be causing this?
[12:02:48] <Cork> blackmesa: also this is the object in fn functions, so you don't need $()
[12:03:13] <BillCriswell> HenryCH: There's a lot of things.
[12:03:48] <HenryCH> can you think of the most likely?
[12:03:48] <Cork> HenryCH: to start with, don't use return false; that will break other scripts if ever more then one script is interested in an element
[12:03:59] <blackmesa> Cork: thx, but cant I reset a checkbox?
[12:04:01] <HenryCH> I've been trying to find the cause for hours now
[12:04:19] <HenryCH> should I use preventdefault instead?
[12:04:24] <Cork> blackmesa: $('form').each(function() { this.reset(); });
[12:04:29] <Cork> HenryCH: yes
[12:04:42] <HenryCH> ok, I was using that before, but have the same problem
[12:04:51] <Cork> HenryCH: though the cause to why it doesn't work for you is most likely that you run the selector before the element exists
[12:05:10] <HenryCH> how would I prevent that
[12:05:15] <Cork> $() builds a list of the elements th match the selector
[12:05:23] <HenryCH> oh I see, because I include the <script> at the top of the page where the element gets created
[12:05:25] <Cork> .click adds an event listener to each element in the list
[12:05:46] <Cork> HenryCH: do you create the link dynamically?
[12:05:52] <Siecje> Is it possible to put the cursor in a field when the page loads?
[12:06:07] <Cork> Siecje: sure, $(elm).focus()
[12:06:11] <HenryCH> yes, I have a php page get some data from a database and then echoing out the link
[12:06:23] <Cork> HenryCH: that isn't dynamically
[12:06:32] <HenryCH> oh
[12:06:35] <Cork> HenryCH: is the html in the original page load
[12:06:43] <Cork> or is it added through js later on
[12:06:48] <Cork> (ex. ajax)
[12:07:04] <Cork> if not, you just need to wait for ready
[12:07:07] <Cork> ?api ready
[12:07:08] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[12:07:16] <HenryCH> no, the html is always created through the .php, but I use ajax to request the .php periodically
[12:07:30] <Cork> HenryCH: uh...
[12:07:44] <Cork> HenryCH: if the php generates the content or not doens't matter
[12:07:51] <Cork> if you load it through ajax it does
[12:08:18] <blackmesa> Cork: my checkbox is still checked after $('form').each(function() { this.reset(); }); After page reload its reseted
[12:08:22] <HenryCH> hm, I guess I do then
[12:08:24] <Cork> HenryCH: if you load it through ajax you need to either bind the event after you've added the element, or use a delegated event
[12:08:28] <Cork> ?api delegate
[12:08:29] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:08:35] <Cork> read that page
[12:08:48] <Cork> and then if you like you can use .on() (mentioned in that page)
[12:08:58] <HenryCH> ok, will do, thanks Cork
[12:10:27] <HenryCH> so delegate would work with a specific id?
[12:11:18] <Cork> blackmesa: http://jsfiddle.net/wymDW/
[12:11:19] <Cork> wfm
[12:11:33] <Cork> blackmesa: note though reset resets the form to the state it was when the html was loaded
[12:11:38] <Cork> it doesn't empty the form
[12:12:02] <Cork> HenryCH: yes ex. $(document).on('click', '#id', function() {})
[12:12:08] <blackmesa> big thx Cork
[12:12:24] <Cork> HenryCH: or $(document).delegate('#id', 'click', function() {}) for delegate
[12:13:29] <HenryCH> ok, trying it now
[12:13:46] <HenryCH> yessssssssssss
[12:13:51] <HenryCH> thanks!
[12:13:56] <Cork> :)

[12:20:44] <b-ot> Cork: 2013-09-27
[12:21:41] <Cork> krambiorix: if you mean the format used by date picker, i think it's done through the translation files

[12:22:28] <alaing> any grunt experts?
[12:22:41] <skpp> alaing: i know a little
[12:22:57] <alaing> could you join me #grunt?
[12:23:20] <alaing> I'm trying to get some plugin installed and to learn how to use it
[12:23:21] <skpp> alaing: sorry a little busy
[12:23:32] <alaing> ok no problem thanks anyway
[12:24:24] <skpp> alaing: it is a little confusing in the beginning but basically you just install plugins with npm and then go ahead and use the in your gruntfile
[12:26:18] <skpp> I've got a bunch of elements input and textarea elements which each have a "data-xpath" attribute which in turn have values like e.g. "pattern/problem". the elements themselves have values like "My problem". i would like to create a DOM tree on the fly that would look like "<pattern><problem>My problem</problem></pattern>. how would you go about that?
[12:27:24] <Cork> skpp: so, your talking about xml here?
[12:27:39] <alaing> I ran this sudo npm install -g grunt-contrib-sass
[12:27:47] <alaing> but when I run grunt --help it wasn't listing
[12:27:53] <alaing> https://gist.github.com/aliuk2012/6733120 this is my Gruntfile.js
[12:28:24] <skpp> Cork: no, I just happen to have those XPath selections which I thought might be useful in this endeavor
[12:28:56] <Cork> skpp: i meant <pattern><problem> isn't valid html
[12:29:08] <Cork> so if it isn't xml where are you planing to use it?
[12:30:44] <skpp> Cork: I know but jQuery can create valid html from $('<pattern><problem>'). basically, the idea is to create a document from the xpath values and the values of the elements. theoretically, that is all that one would need
[12:30:59] <skpp> alaing: sorry I don't know
[12:31:18] <Cork> anyway '<' + $(this).data('xpath').split('/').join('><') + '>' + $(this),val() +  + $(this).data('xpath').split('/').join('></') + '>'
[12:31:20] <Cork> opps
[12:31:27] <Cork> anyway '<' + $(this).data('xpath').split('/').join('><') + '>' + $(this),val() + '</' + $(this).data('xpath').split('/').join('></') + '>'
[12:31:36] <Cork> that should give you what you want
[12:31:52] <Cork> skpp: no jquery can't create valid html from that
[12:31:57] <Cork> cause those tags are invalid
[12:32:10] <Cork> it can add the invalid tags to the dom, but they are still invalid
[12:32:27] <Cork> (and you should NOT add made up tags to the dom)
[12:32:39] <Cork> unless it is an xml document
[12:32:51] <shoelessone> question: i need to support IE 9 and above and am making a javascript "thing" taht needs to support uploading images without page reload. Every browser that I'm working with works with the File API for HTML5, EXCEPT for IE 9
[12:33:20] <shoelessone> I'm wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation, and if so if you can recommend a specific jquery plugin that will allow me to use IE 9 with ajax file uploads without a ton of overhead
[12:33:25] <Cork> shoelessone: you would have to have a flash/silverlight fallback for ie
[12:33:25] <skpp> $('<pattern><element>') creates valid DOM, try it. not valid HTML but that's a different question
[12:33:41] <shoelessone> Cork: yeah, I know :( - I'm looking for a recommendation on a particular plugin
[12:33:49] <Cork> skpp: no that was the hole point
[12:34:19] <Cork> shoelessone: i've used jqupload
[12:35:09] <Cork> shoelessone: but there are a ton of plugins for it out there
[12:45:07] <ramesh> hello
[12:45:14] <ramesh> need some help
[12:45:42] <ramesh> how can i make two of the elements in array one?
[12:46:19] <ramesh> for example x = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]
[12:46:39] <ramesh> to x = [ 'ab', 'cd' ]
[12:46:42] <jned> I think does it for strings
[12:46:46] <jned> join
[12:48:30] <ramesh> join does it makes it a string i suppose ... i still want it to be array
[12:48:48] <ramesh> sorry for that typo ....
[12:49:08] <ramesh> join makes it a string i suppose ... i still want it to be array
[12:55:37] <shoelessone> Cork: yeah, that's part of the problem - there are lots of them, and many of them were designed for older versions of ie, etc. So I'm trying to find the most modern, lightweight, fast, awesome, plugin that's "modern"... Anyway, I'll just jquploader or whatever, thanks!
[12:56:23] <BillCriswell> ramesh: You can do var n = []; while( x.length ){ n.push([ x.shift(), x.shift() ]); }
[12:56:52] <BillCriswell> Ah, left.
[13:01:28] <Kaylors> Cork: Thanks for all your help. I figured it out :)
[13:01:32] <Kaylors> Cork:Seeya
[13:05:05] <exothermc> I'm using height() to get the height of an element, but it seem like it is returning a lower value, than actual.  When I run the function in the console after the page is rendered then the correct size is returned though.
[13:05:17] <BillCriswell> exothermc: You might want .outerHeight()
[13:05:29] <BillCriswell> exothermc: Oh. Then there's probably images in there.
[13:05:38] <exothermc> BillCriswell: yup
[13:05:49] <BillCriswell> You have to wait for them to load, or set a height on them.
[13:06:18] <exothermc> ok I'm kinda javascript/jquery dummy.  How do it "wait"?
[13:06:29] <exothermc> err how do I wait.
[13:06:39] <Cork> exothermc: listen for the onload event
[13:06:44] <BillCriswell> exothermc: $(document).load(function(){ /* Now get the height */ });
[13:07:00] <exothermc> BillCriswell: thanks
[13:07:52] <BillCriswell> ramesh, should you read the logs and come back I actually think this way is better: for( var i = 0; i < x.length; i += 2 ) twos.push(x.slice(i, i + 2));
[13:27:49] <exothermc> BillCriswell: I'm not clear on exactly how to use that in the context I have here:  http://pastebin.com/u3t0GyjJ  that is an excerpt out of my function.js file which is linked into my html of course.
[13:28:22] <exothermc> BillCriswell: Basically it is just the first line I have a question about.
[13:56:22] <guideX> is it bad to call jQuery over and over?
[13:56:49] <guideX> I hear you create a jquery object everytime you use jQuery
[13:57:46] <guideX> is there some additional benefit of using a $ instead of jQuery, as far as creating the object?

[15:02:05] <jlig> Having issues with ThemeRoller
[15:02:45] <jlig> tried IE, Chrome, and Firefox and tried multiple computers
[15:02:57] <jlig> http error 414
[15:03:06] <snover> maybe its broken
[15:03:25] <jlig> does anyone here fix these things?
[15:03:31] <jlig> I need to find someone who can fix it
[15:03:43] <jlig> well, that would be nice anyway
[15:16:29] <Sepho> hi guys
[15:17:29] <duckgoose> hello
[15:18:09] <Zy> hello
[15:19:01] <Zy> anyone here?
[15:19:09] <Zy> I'm having trouble with the themeroller
[15:20:22] <jlig> me too
[15:20:38] <jlig> I already reported it, but doesnt seem anyone in here who can fix it
[15:20:39] <Zy> when i click Gallery > Click to preview this theme ... nothing happens
[15:21:03] <Zy> I'm new to jquery
[15:21:25] <jlig> themeroller is nice, when it works :)
[15:21:30] <Zy> sure doesn't inspire much confidence if the main site where you get ui doesn't work
[15:21:36] <jlig> jquery is awesome
[15:21:44] <jlig> dont let that ruin your impression
[15:21:59] <jlig> its super easy to use and powerful
[15:22:20] <Zy> so if I download a css theme from the site, it should in my app even if it isn't working on the site?
[15:22:38] <jlig> it would probably work
[15:22:50] <jlig> I am receiving a 414 error from their site
[15:22:53] <Zy> LOL, love that word "probably"
[15:23:16] <jlig> I think there is a prob with their server processing the requests
[15:23:23] <Zy> ic
[15:23:32] <jlig> the file should come down fine I would think
[15:23:46] <jlig> you cant customize it on themeroller though
[15:23:56] <jlig> and that is the nice part about themeroller
[15:23:59] <Zy> well, I suppose I'll download a gallery theme and if it looks strange, just tweak the css myself
[15:24:01] <jlig> customize before you download
[15:24:27] <jlig> yeah, you can do that
[15:24:38] <jlig> it will give you a start
[15:24:55] <Zy> all I need right now is just some place to start, so I can test modals, etc.
[15:25:06] <Zy> so ... I'm jumping in!
[15:25:22] <jlig> have fun!
[15:25:39] <Zy> thx jlig ... it's nice to have a real person to talk to
[15:26:09] <jlig> I think we are the only real people in here lol
[15:26:21] <jlig> Its fixed!
[15:26:24] <jlig> btw
[15:26:30] <Zy> right now?
[15:26:33] <jlig> It appears to be working now
[15:26:34] <jlig> yes
[15:26:39] <Zy> ok, let me see
[15:26:44] <jlig> guess there are other real people in here too :)
[15:27:09] <Zy> oh wow, that's amazing!
[15:27:12] <jlig> So, first go to the gallery tab
[15:27:19] <jlig> find one that you kinda like
[15:27:31] <Zy> yeah, I see it! so cool
[15:27:35] <Sepho> I'm learning JQuery and I just put a button on my page to test click() function, but it does not working... here is the simplest code ever: http://pastebin.com/0pA0GDKr what am I doing wrong?
[15:27:39] <jlig> click on it to open it, and then go to the Roll Your Own tab
[15:28:55] <Zy> Sepho, did you do the document ready thing?
[15:29:14] <Sepho> hum nop, my own.js has just that function
[15:29:27] <Sepho> do I need to do something on document ready function?
[15:29:52] <Zy> well, jquery only works when the entire library is loaded
[15:30:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> document ready is needed
[15:30:03] <Zy> (from what I understand) I'm new too!
[15:30:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> other thanif your wokring in jsfiddle
[15:30:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> which will automatically include it
[15:30:14] <jlig> click needs to be initialized so that it will know to look for your click action
[15:31:04] <Sepho> so, all my code must be inside document ready, isn't it?
[15:31:26] <Zy> this is a good site, and this page explains document ready:  http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[15:31:48] <Zy> lots of good stuff on that site
[15:32:28] <Sepho> thanks!
[15:33:20] <jlig> you should be able to put your code in document ready
[15:35:33] <jlig> document ready for that button you are pretty much setting up an event listener on that button and you need to do that when the page loads
[15:36:51] <Zy> good luck, Sepho! and jlig,, I've got my theme! I'm off to PLAY!
[15:36:57] <Zy> you folks have a great weekend
[15:37:16] <jlig> Have fun! You guys too!
[15:37:56] <sunbeam> how can i best update the line-height of an element as the element resizes?
[15:57:45] <HenryCH> Hi guys, I have a function handling the click event on links with a certain class, how can I make it such that while the function is running all other clicks are discarded/ignored instead of queued?
[16:04:16] <sahbeewah> HenryCH, essentially, have an "isRunning" flag and check that on your handler
[16:05:10] <sahbeewah> from a ux perspective you should probably disable those links, and re-enable them when it will actually do something again
[16:06:34] <HenryCH> hm, but if several links have the same class, how would I go about disabling them
[16:07:02] <HenryCH> if they had an ID I guess I could delete the html first thing on the click function
[16:07:35] <HenryCH> I mean, how would I go about disabling just the one that's already been clicked
[16:09:14] <sahbeewah> the context of your click handler is the element being clicked
[16:09:31] <sahbeewah> i.e. you can type "this" inside your handler and it will refer to the element being clicked
[16:10:01] <HenryCH> I see, so can I just do this.html("");?
[16:10:26] <HenryCH> and then when I finish processing I put it back this.html("link");
[16:11:37] <sahbeewah> "this" will refer to the dom element, not the jquery object, so you'll have to wrap it - $(this).empty();
[16:13:13] <sunbeam> i'm updating line height on resize, somehow this doesnt work "live"
[16:13:47] <HenryCH> don't quite understand what you mean sahbeewah
[16:14:02] <HenryCH> why can I not work with the dom element
[16:15:35] <sahbeewah> HenryCH, you can, you just can't use any jquery methods on it. so alternatively you could do - this.innerHTML = '';
[16:15:53] <HenryCH> ah, understood, thanks
[16:29:26] <sunbeam> whats the best way to vertically align a div?
[16:29:35] <sunbeam> (i dont know the height of the div and its parent)
[16:32:01] <sahbeewah> sunbeam, fairly certain that's not possible
[16:32:06] <sahbeewah> you can ask at #css
[16:33:41] <sunbeam> hmm
[16:34:34] <tw2113> flexbox would do it
[16:34:40] <tw2113> though it's still kind of spotty in support
[16:36:11] <sunbeam> tw2113: great!
[16:36:14] <sunbeam> which function should i search for?
[16:36:36] <sunbeam> hmmm it hasnt been updated since 2010
[16:36:54] <tw2113> it's not a function
[16:36:56] <tw2113> it's css
[16:37:07] <tw2113> ?g mdn flexbox css3
[16:37:08] <b-ot> tw2113: Using CSS flexible boxes - Web developer guide | MDN  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes
[16:37:10] <guideX> shouldn't jquery be able to select this class?  icheck0.08734836266376078
[16:37:50] <sunbeam> tw2113: the problem is
[16:37:53] <sunbeam> i dont know the height
[16:38:03] <tw2113> sunbeam, you won't need to if you use flexbox
[16:38:12] <sunbeam> really wow
[16:38:13] <sunbeam> ok lets try
[16:38:32] <tw2113> don't automatically use it, weigh the pros and cons in regards to the browser support
[16:39:44] <tw2113> different browser versions of the same browser may use previous versions of the flexbox spec as well, so prefixes may be needed too
[16:39:56] <sunbeam> hmm
[16:40:01] <sunbeam> IE10 only supports it
[16:40:03] <mitzev_> i have a list of linkes, when a user clicks one, i want to disable the other links, as the page will load the first link clicked
[16:40:06] <mitzev_> how?
[16:40:54] <tw2113> all of the browsers support it at some level sunbeam
[16:42:24] <sunbeam> tried box but IE9 doesnt seem to
[16:42:37] <sunbeam> display: -ms-box; -ms-box-pack: center; -ms-box-align: center;
[16:42:59] <tw2113> http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox
[16:44:22] <sunbeam> see :( no ie9
[16:44:28] <sunbeam> should use js for this
[16:45:04] <tw2113> which is why i said weigh pros and cons
[16:46:32] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: i got it working
[16:46:43] <i8igmac> thanks for your advise
[16:46:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: i saw have been monitoring website
[16:46:54] <i8igmac> lol
[16:46:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: hope you dont mind
[16:47:02] <i8igmac> i only get a few hours a day at it
[16:47:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: 1 issue as i scroll i would rpefer from user perspective to have images load row by row
[16:47:38] <i8igmac> i was thinking the same
[16:47:58] <sunbeam> tw2113: yep ok
[16:48:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: also your images when you click still the iframes......get rid of them
[16:57:54] <jacoluta> http://jsfiddle.net/h5MgS/ can someone tell me why the .push is pushing multiple times to each array
[17:10:13] <mitzev_> how can i display the the layer of an element?
[17:35:11] <guideX> anyone know how to handle the click event of jquery icheck?
[18:15:34] <banzounet> Hey guys, why is this not working : $(this).children('img').css("opacity", "0,7"); ?
[18:16:10] <banzounet> Am i doing something wrong?
[18:16:42] <tw2113> comma instead of period
[18:16:51] <boytoy> Hey
[18:17:08] <tw2113> banzounet
[18:17:31] <banzounet> tw2113: Thanks ! (Getting late :D)
[18:17:37] <boytoy> That Gmail compose window. What's that called really, I mean what's the technical term for it? Just "window"?
[18:19:22] <boytoy> Not sure where to ask this one. I'll try #web
[18:20:22] <T13|sleeps> Textarea what you're looking for?
[18:22:46] <boytoy> T13|sleeps: no like when you're in gmail and you click the Compose button, you get that window in the lower right corner..
[18:23:06] <boytoy> T13|sleeps: is that just a "window" or is there another technical term for it?
[18:23:28] <T13|sleeps> It's technically an html <textarea>
[18:24:17] <boytoy> T13|sleeps: not just a textarea since it has text inputs, a Send button and a whole host of other options?
[18:24:55] <boytoy> i.e. is it an "expandable window" or a "window widget" or something like that?
[18:25:06] <tw2113> popup?
[18:25:18] <boytoy> hmm..
[18:25:27] <boytoy> yeah popup window sounds nice
[18:26:37] <boytoy> yeah..
[18:27:25] <tw2113> psyching yourself up for popup windows boytoy ?
[18:28:17] <T13|sleeps> Ahhh then you want the whole <form>
[18:29:16] <boytoy> tw2113: hehe yeah im scheduled for a 5 round fight :)
[18:30:17] <boytoy> T13|sleeps: im not sure what you mean. have you seen the gmail compose window? i was just curious what people normally would call it, no biggie
[18:58:40] <juboba> how can I append 2 elements to a selector?
[18:58:46] <juboba> 2 or more
[19:00:40] <RRR2> to a selector?
[19:00:58] <tw2113> you mean select multiple things at once?
[19:00:58] <RRR2> you use 2 selectors
[19:01:15] <tw2113> $('#idone, #idtwo').something()
[19:06:45] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know how to import bulk emails from gmail to outlook, it only does like 2-500 a time
[19:08:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> LoneSoldier728: sry to be upfront this is not general win7 tech support channel its for jquery
[19:09:46] <doug65536> juboba: do you mean to a selector or to an element?
[19:10:23] <juboba> to an element
[19:10:48] <doug65536> juboba: add elements to a selector: .add, add elements to an element: .append. yes you can append multiple at once if you append something that contains multiple
[19:12:11] <juboba> what's the difference between add and append?
[19:13:52] <jayar> so if the % resets to zero when it gets to the end, how do i have it not do that? i want it to just iterate back n forth within a small array... counter = (counter + 1) % stuff.length;
[19:14:24] <doug65536> juboba: var things = $('.red'); if(blueToo) { things.add('.blue'); } ...
[19:15:02] <doug65536> makes "things" also refer to the .blue things if blueToo is true
[19:16:26] <doug65536> juboba: .add: add elements to a selector, .append: appends elements as children to an element
[19:17:08] <juboba> ohh
[19:17:40] <juboba> so if I add: <div/> to <a/> I get: <div></div><a></a>
[19:18:25] <doug65536> juboba: not quite. .add doesn't modify the document or anything - it makes a selector also select the thing you add
[19:20:08] <Decalmo> is there a way to get the post action from my form instead of having to specify the action URL in my jQuery?
[19:20:31] <jayar> how do i get this counter to get to 5 and stop?
[19:20:41] <doug65536> Decalmo: read the attribute. $(event.target).closest('form').attr('action')
[19:20:58] <Decalmo>  ah lovely
[19:21:05] <Decalmo> many thanks
[19:21:11] <Decalmo> quite new to jQuery here
[19:21:56] <doug65536> Decalmo: I made assumptions about where you are doing the submit though, in that example. I'm assuming you are doing it in an on submit handler and your callback takes a parameter called "event"
[19:23:20] <Decalmo> yes that is correct
[19:23:33] <Decalmo> so if I do this on form submit, it'll grab the nearest form element and yada yada
[19:23:37] <Decalmo> as it travels up the DOM
[19:23:42] <Decalmo> this will do nicely methinks
[19:23:44] <doug65536> yes
[19:23:50] <Decalmo> Doug, you rule
[19:23:52] <Decalmo> thank you
[19:23:56] <doug65536> np
[19:23:58] <Decalmo> :D
[19:45:12] <jayar> how do i write this so it doesnt reset to zero? counter = (counter + 1) % stuff.length;
[19:45:28] <jayar> i want it to step back n forth between 0-5
[19:50:15] <jayar> does next() only traverse through elements in the dom or can i use it to step through an array...
[19:55:39] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: my search bar gave command execution lol
[19:55:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: ?
[19:56:06] <i8igmac> if you search for topic' & cat /etc/passwd
[19:56:13] <i8igmac> i fixed it
[19:56:15] <i8igmac> sorta
[19:59:44] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/PwrMg/1/ -- how do I remove .active from the div when clicking anywhere outside it?
[20:02:27] <doug65536> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/PwrMg/2/
[20:03:00] <doug65536> boytoy: event.stopPropagation();
[20:03:14] <boytoy> doug65536: much obliged =)
[20:03:22] <boytoy> ill read up on that one right away
[20:03:33] <doug65536> boytoy: what was happening was, the click in the div was bubbling up and hitting the other one that removes the class
[20:04:16] <doug65536> boytoy: event.stopPropagation() tells the browser, "don't bubble this event up anymore"
[20:04:52] <boytoy> oh yeah, now i understand
[20:04:57] <boytoy> great!! =)
[20:05:04] <doug65536> boytoy: there is another, probably better approach though...
[20:05:47] <boytoy> doug65536: as long as it's not http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-outside-events/examples/clickoutside/ :P
[20:06:03] * boytoy scratches head
[20:06:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: cool
[20:06:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: its a plugin right?
[20:06:16] <boytoy> how can it get any better than this? i mean like your fiddle
[20:07:16] <i8igmac> no,its my goofy foolish way of doing things
[20:07:42] <doug65536> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/PwrMg/5/
[20:07:55] <boytoy> doug65536: by the way should i check if the element has class active before removing it like line 7 at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/PwrMg/6/ ?
[20:08:18] <boytoy> holy.. whats going on here =)
[20:09:06] <doug65536> boytoy: don't check, removeClass checks already
[20:09:10] <tw2113> $()
[20:09:15] <boytoy> oh ok
[20:09:48] <boytoy> brilliant
[20:09:56] <doug65536> boytoy: what that does is say, start at what they clicked and look through the parents and tell me how many of them are #click_me
[20:10:08] <doug65536> if none are, remove the class
[20:10:24] <doug65536> it would be more useful if you had a class instead of an id
[20:11:37] <boytoy> very cool..
[20:12:09] <boytoy> but if its id http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/PwrMg/2/ will suffice right?
[20:12:37] <doug65536> yes
[20:13:01] <doug65536> boytoy: I try not to stopPropagation when possible though
[20:13:43] <doug65536> it basically kills the ability to do click event delegation for children of that div
[20:14:38] <boytoy> i see i see.. ill keep that in mind too, thanks
[20:15:59] <T13|sleeps> doug65536: how does someone go about changing the right click list options? Is there a tutorial for that?
[20:17:39] <T13|sleeps> I want to add a site specific section for when I'm on Wikipedia to be able to quickly navigate to other pages/wiki functions.
[20:18:01] <T13|sleeps> When I right click on a link.
[20:45:06] <jayar> how do i change the css property of the parent of an element?
[20:45:13] <jayar> i have 		$('#nav0, #nav1, #nav2, #nav3, #nav4, #nav5').css("background-color", "#eee");
[20:45:20] <sammich> $().parent().css()
[20:45:39] <sammich> for more than one element it's not so easy
[20:45:47] <jayar> yea how would i do that
[20:45:55] <jayar> parent(#nav0)
[20:47:38] <sammich> um, yeah you can just go
[20:47:40] <sammich> $().parent().css()
[20:47:58] <jayar> yea i just got it :)
[20:47:59] <jayar> thanx

[22:35:41] <murloclinux> I am trying to get a basic Bootstrap template to show up in Google App Engine (with python), and it loads fine by opening the html file itself, but not through Google App Engine
[22:36:04] <murloclinux> It cannot find the resources in the bootstrap/ directory for some reason
[22:36:27] <murloclinux> Does anyone know about this?
[22:38:28] <jphase> murloclinux: This sounds more like a problem with loading resources rather than anything with jQuery. Do you have a jQuery-related error?
[22:39:38] <murloclinux> Yeah I don't think it's really a jQuery related error, I have asked in the #appengine and ##twitter-bootstrap channels waiting for a response. Just thought I would post here in case in the mean time, don't expect a response here.
[22:40:15] <jphase> generally speaking, I'd just toy around with your GAPP Engine resources. I'm doing similar things with SalesForce right now and had to change a cache setting from private to public for example
[22:40:40] <jphase> do you have a public URL for this?
[22:41:06] <murloclinux> Not yet :P I have been meaning to push it to a git repo
[22:41:50] <x-finite> what would be the most effective way to populate a select box with sequential numbers using jquery .. i am trying to use this but it throws me an unexpected token error http://pastebin.com/FBy3rUNc
[22:42:00] <jphase> well normally my first step with failed to load resource errors is viewing source and clicking on the link of the resource in question, which will 404 probably, but then I just try to make that path right.
[22:45:25] <jphase> x-finite: there's a few syntax problems here, but here's a basic fix for you: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6yHsf/
[22:45:41] <jphase> when you use .append()    nothing inside the .append(    should end in ;
[22:45:59] <jphase> there was also an extra } at the end of your for loop
[22:46:05] <jphase> or ) or something, can't remember
[22:50:22] <shafox> hi, i have a $.ajax query. when i do $.ajax get method to get certain json object from my controller how to show the content that i fetched in a particular div ??
[22:50:56] <jphase> shafox: first you have to do something like data = $.parseJSON(data);
[22:51:02] <jphase> then you should have an object
[22:51:14] <jphase> you can check if the length of the object is > 0 and iterate through it with .each
[22:51:27] <jphase> if(data.length){
[22:51:39] <jphase> that kinda thing
[22:52:47] <jphase> it's really depending on your JSON object when you do with it in the .each
[22:53:03] <shafox> jphase: I am sending the json object from my php with json_encode($var). i am getting the result in the view page in $.ajax({type:"get", and then storing that value in another variable . but then i want to populate that data in the content area that is a divwith id xyz . ? i want that particular section to reload nothing else
[22:54:19] <x-finite> jphase works great
[22:54:20] <jphase> sec, let me show you
[22:55:02] <shafox> ok
[23:06:14] <jphase> shafox: http://pastebin.ws/eb1vul is a loose example
[23:06:20] <jphase> you'd need to put that in your success function
[23:06:49] <jphase> and replace my .append with however you want to build content
[23:11:16] <jphase> also might want to add a check in that if to see if it's also not undefined as well as length > 0 or that will throw an error if there's ever no response from your server side script
[23:14:50] <aro> is there a way to make $.getScript() use cached copies?
[23:15:23] <jphase> aro: cache: true
[23:16:00] <jphase> you can also define your own cache script method too if you needed to get fancy
[23:16:22] <aro> where does that setting go?
[23:16:34] <aro> jQuery.getScript( url [, success(script, textStatus, jqXHR) ] )
[23:16:42] <aro> i just see the url and a callback as params
[23:16:45] <jphase> aro: before your .ajax() call you use something like $.ajaxSetup({cache: true});
[23:17:06] <aro> right
[23:17:07] <aro> saw that too
[23:17:12] <aro> but thats going to screw up the rest of our ajax
[23:17:33] <jphase> you can set it to false right afterwards as well
[23:17:42] <jphase> .ajaxSetup just modifies static values
[23:17:45] <aro> ok
[23:18:29] <aro> if i did it like this... function getsc() { $.ajaxSetup({cache: true}); $.getScript(...); }
[23:18:38] <aro> would that just change the ajaxSetup scope within that function
[23:18:42] <aro> or globally?
[23:19:15] <jphase> it would be a static value so globally yes
[23:19:20] <aro> ok
[23:19:26] <jphase> for all subsequent .ajax calls that is
[23:21:51] <shafox> jphase: this is my whole code. http://pastebin.ws/7en9qx . but dunno how to render that in the div
[23:23:09] <jphase> shafox: no script tag or doc ready or anything
[23:23:19] <jphase> I assume you have those in your full script?
[23:24:03] <shafox> yes doc ready in the full script.
[23:24:30] <jphase> so yeah, I gave you the example of what to put in your success function
[23:25:37] <shafox> do i have to parse the json to text to render ? ?
[23:25:55] <jphase> that will give you the json object for you to iterate through with .each
[23:26:05] <jphase> so you need something like I gave you in your success function
[23:26:28] <jphase> like this:  http://pastebin.ws/eenyeq
[23:26:36] <jphase> whoa, tabs are all messed up there
[23:26:45] <jphase> but at least you can see my addition heh
[23:27:05] <shafox> yeah
[23:27:15] <jphase> so in your case, you'll obviously change the span and br tag to whatever you want
[23:27:38] <jphase> perhaps build <li> elements or something
[23:28:23] <jphase> woops, the doc ready was just in there from something else
[23:29:03] <jphase> oh and remove that var result = result
[23:29:13] <jphase> and the other stuff below that too
[23:29:31] <jphase> I typically just build out my elements in jQuery DOM objects and then append them
[23:29:38] <jphase> but you can do it however you want really
[23:29:40] <shafox> ok.. but still its not loading up the content
[23:29:57] <jphase> do you have a live URL so I can see the JSON object?
[23:31:14] <shafox> let me give you the json object https://gist.github.com/shadow-fox/6739123
[23:31:34] <shafox> this is the json object that i am getting , i am developing locally so cant give you any live link
[23:35:16] <shafox> jphase: ^^
[23:35:18] <jphase> shafox: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6yHsf/1/
[23:36:01] <jphase> so if you take the if statement there, replace data with result in that example you can just paste that into your success function
[23:36:45] <jphase> then change the markup however you want
[23:37:17] <shafox> i know , i tried there must be something wrong with the php side, its giving me the json object but when i am console.log(result) inside success i am not getting anything
[23:37:48] <jphase> shafox: what's in the response from your network tab?
[23:41:20] <shafox_> jphase: sorry got disconnectedd
[23:41:34] <shafox_> the network tab shows me that its type is text/html
[23:42:09] <jphase> but in the response tab of that response specifically
[23:42:18] <jphase> just the JSON object string?
[23:42:37] <shafox_> yes just the json object jphase
[23:44:04] <jphase> shafox_: and when you do result = $.parseJSON(result); can you console.log(result) after and it looks good like the object you need?
[23:45:38] <shafox> jphase: back with the nickname
