[01:24:00] <Hilton> Are values set using jQuery: .data('oomph', 5) visible to CSS: [data-oomph=5]? Or do I have to use .attr('data-oomph', 5)...in which case, does the latter become visible to calls to .data('oomph') - ?

[05:31:19] <hillpig> why pagecreate function is continuously called on mobile device, yet only called once in desktop browser?http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26673106/answer/submit
[05:33:58] <Jandje> apparently there arent any people here :P
[05:37:39] <hillpig1> hi
[05:37:45] <hillpig1> anybody here?
[05:38:34] <hillpig1> hi,anybody here?
[05:44:07] <hillpig1> hi
[05:48:16] <hillpig1> hi,anybody here?
[05:48:21] <daylum> yes, ask.
[05:49:04] <daylum> i'm trying to find a way to architecture my app. i'd like to have all my functions in a common namespace (not window) and i was asking myself if there is one (or more) generally accepted solutions for doing this?
[05:49:24] <hillpig1> when i use this example,
[05:49:25] <hillpig1>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26673106/how-to-make-jquery-mobile-tab-header-as-fixed
[05:49:25] <hillpig1> pagecreate function is called several times on mobile device
[05:49:25] <hillpig1> pagecreate function is called only once on desktop browsers, such as firefox
[05:50:16] <daylum> (and could'nt come up with anything, thats why i ask you, #jquery <3)
[05:51:34] <hillpig1> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="vendor/jquery.mobile-1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css" />
[05:51:34] <hillpig1> <script type="application/javascript" src="vendor/jquery-1.11.2/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
[05:51:34] <hillpig1> <script type="application/javascript" src="vendor/jquery.mobile-1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js" ></script>
[05:52:18] <daylum> i think youre not supposed to paste code/markup in here.
[05:52:43] <daylum> put your code and all markup in a jsfiddle.com and paste that url in here
[05:52:55] <daylum> thats how people can help you
[05:53:10] <hillpig1> thank you
[05:53:15] <daylum> yw
[05:53:33] <hillpig1> http://jsfiddle.net/ezanker/k8jhLzks/
[05:53:44] <hillpig1> i use this same code
[05:56:53] <daylum> is this reloading constantly only for me?
[05:58:48] <hillpig1> hi
[06:01:01] <hillpig1> i need help, i use:http://jsfiddle.net/ezanker/k8jhLzks/,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26673106/how-to-make-jquery-mobile-tab-header-as-fixed, but it seems pagecreate function called many times on mobile device, which is hoped only once.
[06:01:10] <daylum> why aren't you using the standard jqm navigation system?
[06:02:52] <daylum> your tab pages, why aren't they jqm pages?
[06:03:26] <daylum> try having each of your tab pages a jqm page then you won't need any code for navigation
[06:05:22] <hillpig1> i tried to use tabs in content(<div role="main" class="ui-content"><div data-role="tabs" id="tabs" ></div></div>), but if the tab content is too large, there is a scroll bar for the whole content, I cann't see the navbar:)
[06:05:23] <daylum> check this, which is what you're working with i guess? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/tabs/tabbed-content.html
[06:05:41] <daylum> i see.
[06:05:58] <daylum> i overcome this by having my navbar position:fixed
[06:07:13] <hillpig1> thank you @daylum
[06:07:27] <daylum> welcome
[06:08:07] <hillpig1> i have tried postion:fixed, it works.
[06:08:53] <hillpig1> another question, which pull-to-refresh lib you use?
[06:09:19] <daylum> i never needed pull to refresh yet
[06:09:31] <hillpig1> ok
[06:09:35] <hillpig1> thank you
[06:10:01] <daylum> but i'm looking into it as i'll doing it in the future for sure
[06:10:03] <daylum> yw
[06:10:09] <Duvdevan> hi
[06:10:15] <Duvdevan> how to execute this code once:
[06:10:28] <Duvdevan> $('body').on('click', '.something', function() {}); ?
[06:10:37] <Duvdevan> shoule $.one() do the trick?
[06:11:02] <Duvdevan> $('body').one('click', '.something', function() {});
[06:11:04] <Duvdevan> like that?
[06:11:37] <daylum> you want to fire the event only 1 time?
[06:12:14] <Duvdevan> yes
[06:12:20] <daylum> .one( events [, data ], handler ): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element per event type.
[06:12:46] <Duvdevan> I've just saw on jquery docs this:
[06:12:59] <Duvdevan> .one( events [, selector ] [, data ] )
[06:13:01] <Duvdevan> so?
[06:13:57] <daylum> i guess so if it's in docs
[06:14:19] <Duvdevan> good
[06:14:21] <Duvdevan> thanks daylum
[06:14:23] <Duvdevan> :)
[06:14:26] <daylum> welcome
[06:52:56] <daylum> variable names starting with $ simply indicate that it's a jquery object, right?
[06:55:20] <sash_> daylum: It's more kind of a convention.
[06:55:28] <daylum> yeah
[06:55:32] <daylum> ment that
[06:55:41] <daylum> indicate to oneself
[06:55:43] <sash_> daylum: Angular uses it, too.
[06:56:09] <daylum> i shaped up with angular.
[06:56:13] <sash_> daylum: Angular Prefixes $ and $$: To prevent accidental name collisions with your code, Angular prefixes names of public objects with $ and names of private objects with $$. Please do not use the $ or $$ prefix in your code.
[06:56:26] <sash_> From the docs
[06:56:58] <daylum> i havent had the chance yet to convert my brain to angular.
[06:57:03] <daylum> i know i have to.
[07:00:43] <Duvdevan> is there a callback for "data" attributes after the value has been set?
[07:05:16] <buzzlewoo> hello?

[07:13:32] <buzzlewoo> trying to build some samples PDQ for recruiters
[07:21:54] <buzzlewoo> is it correct procedure for styling to snake the CSS from firebug and use that in my style.css file?

[09:56:28] <mozzarella> guys
[10:04:29] <adavia> is it ajax a good option for a small poll chat?
[10:06:57] <Valduare> what other options do I have for the effect of  mouseenter   that works on touch screen devices as well
[10:08:44] <reynierpm> hi, happy new year to every one, I have this code http://jsbin.com/gisibamage/1/edit?js as you can see there is two vars htmlFabricanteBody and htmlSelFabricanteBody the only difference between the code where I set the content of each var is the line with class .modalAgregarPaises the last one before end the htmlFabricanteBody var content, my question, in order to avoid DRY how I can remove it from the content and append to the #selFabricanteBody?
[10:33:35] <Valduare> quite dead channel lately
[10:39:53] <OnceMe> I need small help
[10:40:02] <OnceMe> How can I make a delay on hover function: http://pastebin.com/wrubbeDF
[10:40:22] <OnceMe> so when mouseenters, I don't want to call ajax/show profile box instant, I want some delay, because user might accidently hoveerd over thumbnail
[10:40:30] <Valduare> $('#quickcart').slideUp("500");
[10:40:31] <OnceMe> I need about 2s before calling ajax, how to do this?
[10:40:49] <Valduare> oh a delay nm
[10:41:00] <RizziCR> use setTimeout
[10:41:04] <OnceMe> I did
[10:41:07] <OnceMe> you can see Im using it
[10:41:15] <OnceMe> on timer
[10:41:37] <OnceMe> but on hover, if previous event is idling, I need to kill that one restart it and run this again
[10:41:41] <OnceMe> Im not sure why, but it does not work
[10:42:49] <RizziCR> a clearTimeout don’t stop the ajax if it is already called
[10:43:25] <RizziCR> its just stop the timer
[10:43:49] <Nialcen> Hello all, I have a function calling a page with some arguments, then wait for 1sec before change window.location.href. (see here http://www.codeshare.io/SMHrb ) I would like to wait for a king of signal that my called page finished its job before changing location instead of using setTimeout. How can I do that ?
[10:43:53] <OnceMe> ok so what to do add then and where
[10:44:09] <OnceMe> $updates.on('mouseenter', '.callprofile_box', function( event ) { setTimeout(2000); } ?
[10:46:09] <RizziCR> $updates.on('mouseenter', '.callprofile_box', function( event ) { setTimeout(function(){your_ajax_call}, 2000); } ?
[10:49:04] <OnceMe> hmm RizziCR not works
[10:49:07] <OnceMe> you can check my code
[10:49:14] <OnceMe> I use two events mouseenter and mouseout
[10:49:49] <RizziCR> $updates.on('mouseenter', '.callprofile_box', function( event ) { timer=setTimeout(function(){your_ajax_call}, 2000); }
[10:50:04] <RizziCR> on mouseout event do a clearTimeout(timer);
[10:51:08] <Valduare> speaking of mouseenter mouseout   how have that functionality but with touch devices as well
[10:52:10] <coach_McGuirk> anyone answering jquery questions today?
[10:53:38] <OnceMe> RizziCR:not work again :(
[10:53:47] <OnceMe> I have two mouseenters and mouseleave's as you can see
[10:53:54] <OnceMe> on one I have setTimeout
[10:53:58] <OnceMe> and when I clear it, nothing shows up
[10:54:10] <RizziCR> as aspected or?
[10:54:50] <RizziCR> your code is removed
[10:55:39] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/X7aFLACp
[10:55:58] <OnceMe> see the last 4 lines
[10:57:38] <beefKitten> coach_mcguirk: whats the ?
[10:58:21] <RizziCR> OnceMe: if you need a delay before call the ajax request.. you need to surround the ajax request with the setTimeout
[10:59:00] <coach_McGuirk> beefKitten: Im trying to set the width and height of image using jquery that i gathered from jquery ui draggable
[10:59:15] <OnceMe> I understand that
[10:59:18] <OnceMe> but why does it not work?
[10:59:21] <OnceMe> I did what you told me
[10:59:27] <RizziCR> no
[10:59:28] <coach_McGuirk> i dont know if that makes much sense or if i need to elaborate
[10:59:50] <Valduare> anyone know about mouseenter mouseleave on touch devices
[10:59:56] <RizziCR> OnceMe: you set the setTimeout on mouseleave event
[11:00:01] <coach_McGuirk> beefKitten: im doing a jquery ui drag and drop
[11:00:14] <OnceMe> yes I did
[11:00:15] <RizziCR> OnceMe: but there you have to clear the timeout
[11:00:16] <beefKitten> coach_McGuirk: gotcha, what's the problem?
[11:00:35] <OnceMe> but I want on mouseleave to delay leaving of showed profile box
[11:00:41] <OnceMe> its basically the same thing as what facebook does
[11:01:12] <OnceMe> hover on thumbnail, wait 1s show profile box/cover pic and info in profile box, inside profile box, nothing happens, and hover out profile box, wait 1s then hide it.
[11:01:19] <RizziCR> OnceMe: then i don’t understand what you are trying to do :D
[11:01:44] <coach_McGuirk> beefKitten: well im dragging and dropping thumbnails into a droppable area, once the thumb is dragged there it should change the droppable to that thumbnail image.  However i need to readjust the size of the image because its showing the full size image.  I need to change the size of the image to the same size as the droppable area's size
[11:01:57] <OnceMe> RizziCR:.realshow is a profilebox inside thumbnail
[11:02:13] <beefKitten> coach_McGuirk: do you have any code?
[11:02:58] <coach_McGuirk> beefKitten: sure, i can do a jsfiddle
[11:04:02] <beefKitten> coach_McGuirk: cool
[11:04:57] <OnceMe> RizziCR:more cleAR?
[11:05:35] <RizziCR> i think :D
[11:05:39] <RizziCR> one moment
[11:08:39] <RizziCR> OnceMe: http://pastebin.com/6s19WMsH
[11:08:58] <RizziCR> you have a logicial mistake in your plan :)
[11:09:14] <RizziCR> take a look my correction
[11:09:23] <RizziCR> *at
[11:09:33] <OnceMe> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[11:09:38] <OnceMe> I would fix syntax error
[11:09:47] <OnceMe> but since its your work, you might want to re-factor it :D
[11:10:34] <RizziCR> i don’t test it.. just modify your code inside pastbin
[11:12:18] <Valduare> damn it stackoverflow is down for maintenence lol
[11:12:25] <Valduare> now I have to rely on you guys for help :P

[11:14:12] <Valduare> RizziCR: im working on making a panel that slides down into view and back up when mouse leaves   I got that part working but then I thought… hmm this sould probably work on touch devices too  so I started
[11:14:23] <Valduare> graphettion: any ideas to this question as well?
[11:14:44] <Valduare> tinkering around with touchstart / touchend but not getting it functional yet
[11:14:54] <RizziCR> OnceMe: http://pastebin.com/TsCAY5cH
[11:15:11] <RizziCR> OnceMe: try this one
[11:18:08] <OnceMe> hmm richardwhiuk
[11:18:13] <OnceMe> RizziCR:that might work
[11:18:34] <OnceMe> however, when I hover on thumbnail, for a 100ms and asap move out cursor, profilebox still shows after 1s
[11:18:51] <OnceMe> I want to profile box show only if my cursor stays on thumbnail for more than 1s
[11:18:56] <OnceMe> thats how FB does it I guess
[11:22:15] <OnceMe> hmm second
[11:24:55] <RizziCR> OnceMe: sorry.. must go.. good luck
[11:24:58] <OnceMe> heh nope
[11:25:00] <OnceMe> still does not work
[11:25:33] <RizziCR> OnceMe: try mouseout then mouseleave
[11:25:47] <factor> What is a good method to test if an page loaded, if not try again?
[11:26:02] <factor> A retry method for jquery.
[11:28:09] <OnceMe> RizziCR:you know whats now the issue
[11:28:11] <OnceMe> all works fine
[11:28:23] <RizziCR> ^^
[11:28:23] <OnceMe> however only thing which does not work, is that profile box shows after 1s
[11:28:40] <OnceMe> even if I had cursor pointer inside thumbnail for 100ms
[11:28:47] <OnceMe> when I use fully your code
[11:28:49] <OnceMe> that thing works
[11:28:55] <OnceMe> but 4 other things does not work :(
[11:48:12] <AcidRain2012>   cxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcx.
[11:48:24] <OnceMe> can someone help me
[11:48:24] <OnceMe> halp
[11:54:17] <OnceMe> SOLVED FINALLY
[11:54:23] <OnceMe> WOOHOO RizziCR
[13:04:23] <dokma> damn... .append() is busting up my HTML entities...
[13:04:49] <dokma> I've got some CLI stuff that spits out HTML and get's picked up by AJAX poll
[13:05:19] <dokma> it comes in in chunks and sometimes it's split in the middle of an HTML entity. Specifically &#x279b;
[13:05:39] <dokma> and when that happens and I .append() it the entity is busted
[13:06:20] <dokma> is there any way to tell .append to not do that?
[13:12:41] <dokma> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ut9obpph/
[13:15:02] <dokma> .append() seems to escape the ampersand when the entity is not complete so that when I append the next chunk it does not for a valid entity any more
[13:15:14] <dokma> *form*
[13:15:35] <shoky> dokma: no you can't tell append not to do that. (it's the browser doing it anyway, you can't have incomplete html in the dom)
[13:15:39] <shoky> dokma: http://jsfiddle.net/ut9obpph/1/
[13:18:23] <dokma> shoky, yeah, just found that out
[13:19:15] <dokma> shoky, the problem is I can't do what you're suggesting
[13:19:53] <dokma> it's a part of a large poll that picks up output from CLI and displays it in the browser. If I wait for all of it to come in it will be a horrid user experience.
[13:24:49] <shoky> dokma: well you can't do it the way you want either. and you'll have even bigger problems with incomplete html tags like..  .append('wow <b')  .append('>this should be bold</b>')
[13:24:51] <dokma> shoky, ahhh... simple fix. I used fgets instead so that the split is always on the new line...
[13:25:28] <shoky> new line doesn't assure you that you don't do   .append('<div> wow')   .append('hey</div>')
[13:25:32] <dokma> shoky, instead of fixing the problem just don't cause it :D
[13:25:47] <shoky> you're still causing it ;)
[13:25:50] <dokma> it does in my case
[13:26:05] <shoky> for the specific html you're checking now, sure....
[13:26:12] <dokma> the CLI outputs only HTML entity that I specified and nothing else other than palin text
[13:26:16] <shoky> if you don't care about any other html, fine
[13:26:38] <dokma> shoky, there won't be any
[13:26:46] <dokma> thanks a bunch!
[13:26:47] <shoky> very error prone anyways
[13:27:06] <Duvdevan> shoky matok
[13:27:13] <shoky> ey
[13:27:36] <Duvdevan> I still haven't figure out to use websocks or long polling :/
[13:27:45] <Duvdevan> boss is furious and investing a lot :P
[13:27:54] <shoky> did you read docs & tuts
[13:28:11] <Duvdevan> hm...
[13:28:19] <Duvdevan> loo :D
[13:28:20] <dokma> Duvdevan, he's investing a lot? That's good...
[13:28:39] <Duvdevan> just some little about long polling with php + $
[13:29:08] <shoky> yack
[13:29:10] <Duvdevan> I need to move to Python as soon as possible too...
[13:35:23] <jim_j> I have $(document).ready(function () { $.getJSON('json_url', function(data){ ...  however, the getJSON doesn't seem to be running, any idea what I'm missing?
[13:36:52] <shoky> jim_j anything in the console? check the browser's network tab see if it makes the connection. add an error handler, console logs. etc.
[13:37:12] <jim_j> shoky, thanks let me check that
[13:38:15] <jim_j> shoky, you were right, 404 not found!
[13:38:33] <shoky> awesome

[15:00:21] <keksike> ¨function even
[15:06:32] <Snerf> keksike, use a callback() function, because its an async call, it wont work like such
[15:06:33] <Snerf> keksike, like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20047163/how-to-get-return-value-in-a-function-with-inside-ajax-call-jquery
[17:21:28] <jim_j> why would $("a").click(function () { alert("Hello evrbdy"); }); give the error:  yntaxError: missing } after property list ?
[17:22:55] <jim_j> ah it's in the wrong place

[20:26:23] <limbera> it isnt' working though
[20:26:33] <limbera> _but_ what it is doing (and i don't really understand how) is displaying the progress in a little status bar on the bottom (almost like it's part of the browser)

[21:06:30] <jim_j> hi
[21:06:31] <jim_j> how do you change the endpoint of a jquery ajax call?
[21:16:30] <Valduare> how can I take a class and apply the class as an ID   ie if it sees class menu-item-1   then add that as an id to the element.
[21:16:49] <beefKitten1> jim_j: set the endpoint as the ajax function's first argument, or pass a settings object with a url param
[21:16:56] <Valduare> working with wordpress menu and only lets me add custom class but not a custom id for some reason
[21:17:09] <jim_j> thanks beef!
[21:17:45] <beefKitten1> valduare: .attr('id', whateverYouWant)
[21:18:13] <Valduare> i need it to mimic the class it finds
[21:19:41] <beefKitten1> valduare: .attr('id', $(whatEverYouNeed).attr('class'))
[21:20:17] <Valduare> stay with me im very new, can you walk me through what that line does?
[21:20:58] <beefKitten1> sure, the .attr allows you to get or set  an attribute on a DOM element
[21:21:43] <beefKitten1> if you want to return a value, get, you only pass the name of the attribute you want from the node
[21:22:00] <beefKitten1> if you want to set an object, the second parameter of .attr is the value the attribute will be set to
[21:22:36] <beefKitten1> Here we set the ID="" attribute to the value returned by .attr('class')
[21:22:40] <beefKitten1> if that makes sense
[21:28:33] <Valduare> hmm
[21:28:41] <Valduare> are you familiar with wordpress menus
[21:28:48] <beefKitten1> not at all
[21:29:05] <beefKitten1> but if you have code to throw in a jsfiddle I'll check it out
[21:29:47] <Valduare> basically it auto generates a menu for you
[21:29:56] <Valduare> so i dont have control over the id’s it genrates
[21:30:28] <Valduare> and I dont have control over the id of the sections as they are generated too - but I can set custom classes in the menu
[21:30:57] <Valduare> so I was thinking maybe if I can append the custom class to the section and my scrollspy will work that way
[21:33:40] <Ayub_> In IE is there a hack to set headers for a cross domain request ?
[21:33:54] <Ayub_> In IE is there a hack to set headers for a cross domain request ?
[21:34:06] <beefKitten1> Valduare:  So you need to append the class name to the section's existing id?
[21:34:41] <Valduare> ya im thinking this thorough now and that would break things.
[21:34:45] <Ayub_> In IE is there a hack to send headers for cross domain request ?
[21:35:40] <SirLagz> Ayub_: In older versions of IE, you could just set the security settings to allow it. Not sure about the newer versions though
[21:36:47] <Ayub_> SirLagz: I am trying to set $.support.cors = true; but it does not seem to work
[21:36:55] <beefKitten1> Valduare: what is the menu doing with ids?
[21:38:38] <Valduare> basically i need to setup anchor tags so takes you to different parts of the page and menu signifies where your at on the page.
[21:38:45] <Valduare> one min I may have something working
[21:43:01] <shebbi> hi, is it still impossible to open a select box with jquery? google says .trigger won't work nor mouseenter or mouseleave.
[21:44:36] <Valduare> woot got it working
[21:44:49] <beefKitten1> Valduare: radd good luck
[21:53:43] <shebbi> anyone?
[21:56:33] <shebbi> awesome worked it out!
[23:17:47] <GodLikeFaker> hi there
[23:17:52] <GodLikeFaker> anyone?
