[00:00:34] <rodd> 4am better go sleep
[00:00:36] <rodd> take care
[00:13:47] <Lyfesaver> hey gloomer =)
[00:33:46] <pandu101> Hi all, newb jquery user. Trying to understand some code. Can u tell what is happenning in line 7 and 9? Code --> http://bpaste.net/show/nq6A2xn5oGPXVIuKwNRu/
[00:38:07] <pandu101> anyone here?
[00:38:30] <systemfault> Yeah
[00:39:28] <systemfault> Looks like the guy who wrote that doesn't know what the hell he's doing
[00:40:32] <pandu101> oh really?
[00:40:44] <systemfault> But basically‚Ä¶ line 7 makes the results element disappear
[00:41:07] <systemfault> Line 9 shows some kind of loading text caption
[00:41:34] <systemfault> And when the ajax transaction ends.. he makes the loading text disappear‚Ä¶ and shows the result.
[00:41:39] <pandu101> the funny thing is there is no such HTML or CSS element with those names
[00:42:23] <pandu101> I got that code from here --> http://www.99points.info/2010/10/ajax-domain-checker-application-with-ajax-and-php/
[00:43:21] <systemfault> That's bad code, find something else :)
[00:44:02] <systemfault> He also mixes up pure dom with jquery‚Ä¶ so his code lacks consistency
[00:44:55] <pandu101> ok thanks. Im new to jquery so I was looking to take existing code and modify it. The only other site that does what I need is http://ajaxwhois.com
[00:48:22] <systemfault> pandu101: ajaxwhois.com sucks less
[00:48:37] <Whirl3d> don't suppose there's any easy way to write something like doFunc(target).done(continue) is there?
[00:48:40] <systemfault> Not sure they give their code
[00:49:03] <systemfault> Whirl3d: What would that do?
[00:49:39] <Whirl3d> basically wait for an async thing to happen before continuing. Right now I have to encapsulate all the code after and put it in an anonymous function
[00:50:35] <Whirl3d> like maybe it could do some ridiculous internal loop and that it would break out of once the deferred was resolved or rejected, for example. LOL
[00:50:45] <systemfault> :/
[00:52:14] <Whirl3d> Like I just realized that my animation wasn't working because I was starting it before it was finished preparing it. I have a resize function that resizes the content that I need to finish before I go on and animate...not I have to split it up into more pieces to implement the deferred on the resize method
[00:52:37] <Whirl3d> now*
[00:52:41] <systemfault> :/
[00:53:04] <systemfault> Seems like you're doing something complex
[00:53:37] <Whirl3d> not at all. LOL I am sure I am blowing this way out of proportion and making it way more difficult than I need to. That's my specialty
[00:53:43] <Whirl3d> 8)
[00:53:44] <systemfault> Ahhh
[00:56:01] <Whirl3d> You know how in a slideshow, before you show your images, you need to get them configured to fit the screen. I encapsulated that function and do something like resizeElement(el); el.animate(..... and it's animating before the resizing is finished
[00:56:55] <systemfault> I wish jQuery had a serialWhen :P
[00:57:07] <systemfault> You could use .pipe‚Ä¶ but it's not elegant IMGO
[00:57:11] <systemfault> IMHO
[00:57:42] <systemfault> I guess you could play with queues‚Ä¶ but I never did it.
[00:58:12] <Whirl3d> have you ever written a gallery or slideshow script?
[00:58:26] <systemfault> Only simple ones..
[00:58:40] <Whirl3d> how did you manage the "current' state
[00:59:06] <systemfault> classes or attributes or data...
[00:59:23] <Whirl3d> oh my
[00:59:28] <systemfault> Yeah.. I know..
[00:59:34] <Whirl3d> no wait, that's lions, tigers, or bears....
[00:59:44] <systemfault> I wasn't that great at that time..
[01:00:21] <Whirl3d> I am trying to code the most basic model that is highly extensible. So that every option is a plugin
[01:00:58] <Whirl3d> That way you can cook up your own gallery using my core and any number of options..roll your own
[01:01:20] <systemfault> It must stay simple or nobody will use it..
[01:01:31] <Whirl3d> sure, that's the idea
[01:01:33] <systemfault> Simple but extensible :)
[01:02:02] <Whirl3d> I am using a custom pub/sub method to attach information handlers to the core
[01:02:13] <systemfault> Why custom?
[01:02:22] <systemfault> Just use jQ events FFS :/
[01:03:38] <systemfault> $('#myPluginNode').on('lulz:slidechange', function(e) {‚Ä¶.
[01:03:54] <Whirl3d> I wanted to create a relationship between the plugins and the core...not a leach-sort of thing where a bunch of outside scripts suck the life out of my gallery. but rather an agreement between the publishing event and the subscriber
[01:04:14] <systemfault> I see
[01:04:51] <systemfault> BTW. have you found a nice base on which to build plugins?
[01:04:54] <Whirl3d> so you would have to have permission to access a method,,,permission only being granted to those scripts that handle the parameters of the callback
[01:05:00] <systemfault> The authoring section tutorial is crap.
[01:05:21] <Whirl3d> Do you have any advice?
[01:05:58] <Whirl3d> I've been looking at jq++
[01:05:59] <systemfault> Not really except that like you said yourself a few minutes ago.. you seem to overcomplexify
[01:06:17] <Whirl3d> totally I do.
[01:07:01] <Whirl3d> Even when I am proud to show my 20 lines of code that do so much, I post them here and 4 minutes later, someone has rewritten tthose 40 lines in 3 and theirs works better
[01:08:54] <systemfault> I see :P
[01:09:06] <converge> I have this catalog http://www.fortunata.com.br/catalogo/ , but it opens 30 images first time you open the page, how could I improve it ?
[01:10:20] <Whirl3d> if you were really massochistic, you could reproduce most of those images as svg files and they would load quick as shit. LOL
[01:11:22] <converge> Whirl3d: I'm thinking about load 3 images each time the user click next page
[01:11:28] <converge> but dont know how to do that
[01:13:13] <Whirl3d> I don't know easySlider, but perhaps you could bind to the click events for the fwd and back buttons and use those to load the next page of images
[01:13:54] <Whirl3d> oh wait, each page is a single image
[01:13:54] <pandu101> hey guys - i want my jquery ajax to be initiated as soon as a user starts typing into a search box. Sort of like google instant search or ajaxwhois.com. What is the json command to do that? Is there something like $.donetyping?
[01:14:27] <systemfault> pandu101: The keyup event..
[01:14:35] <Whirl3d> that should be easier. in the markup, put the urls in a data-url attribute rather than the src attribute
[01:14:46] <pandu101> Thanks Systemfault! :)
[01:15:05] <systemfault> pandu101: You could add a timeout so it doesn't lookup at every keypress
[01:15:12] <converge> Whirl3d: do u know how can I find an example ?
[01:15:35] <Whirl3d> Gimme just a minute to check something. brb
[01:15:38] <pandu101> systemfault: U read my mind! Is the timeout a part of the keyup event?
[01:16:11] <systemfault> pandu101: No, you will need setTimeout and do it yourself :(
[01:16:53] <converge> Whirl3d: ok
[01:16:57] <pandu101> ok thanks. Good to know.
[01:17:20] <systemfault> Sleep time...
[01:17:48] <Whirl3d> gnite systemfault
[01:26:44] <ejo> So... setting the "readonly" attribute on an HTML <select> element makes it greyed out but the user can still make selections and it's still submitted as a successful control in a form?
[01:26:55] <Whirl3d> so, converge, what I would do is this: I would go through your markup and change all of your src= attributes to data-url attributes. This will prevent the images from loading
[01:27:36] <ejo> Is "readonly" on <select>s just an oversight, then?  Or is it kind of there but not really supposed to be used for anything other than greying-out -- since the element does remain active
[01:29:01] <Whirl3d> Then I would write a script that would make a jquery collection of your images and starting with the first, I would make the image's src attribute=url and wait for it to fininsh using a load handler...img.load(do stuff).attr('src', img.attr('data-url'));
[01:29:08] <ejo> Found my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/368813/readonly-select-tag
[01:29:49] <converge> Whirl3d: thanks ill try that
[01:30:14] <Whirl3d> then I would bind a function to the "next and prev" buttons that said nextbutton.click(function () {loadNextImage}...so it would pop the next image on your collection and do the same, keeping one or two ahead eah time
[01:35:13] <converge> Whirl3d: solutuin saved. ill try thanks
[01:39:22] <Whirl3d> what is the best way to handle input parameters that could be of more than one possible type.  In other words, it could be a String, Number, jQobject, Array, etc.   What's the best way to handle all these different possible (and valid) paramter types?
[01:39:44] <ejo> In your backend, for some
[01:40:07] <ejo> there is such a wide range of opinions and practices on input validation, conversion, etc
[01:40:52] <Whirl3d> sure. I was hoping someone could give me some insight into how jquery handles it without having to look throught the source...
[01:40:56] <ejo> some people want it all on the client side... but no matter how much you do it on the client side, you're still not safe to not have the same machinery on the server side
[01:41:07] <sacho> you're talking about something completely different
[01:41:10] <ejo> oh i see, I missed that aspect of your question.
[01:41:43] <ejo> or the main force of it :O
[01:42:17] <Whirl3d> Still, I was listening to what you had to say about form validation and enjoying hearing your opinion...
[01:42:47] <sacho> Whirl3d, they tend to use typeof.
[01:43:15] <Whirl3d> the javascript method of a jquery method?
[01:44:37] <Whirl3d> *or
[01:46:42] <sacho> typeof is not a method
[02:08:24] <tomoyuki28jp> When I append an element and scroll bar appears, It seems like contents area moves to left a little because the scroll bar area created. How can I make it not to move the left?
[02:11:14] <tomoyuki28jp> this does the trick, thanks guys. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6466344/how-to-make-body-tag-to-adjust-for-scroll-bar
[02:36:38] <Whirl3d> could you loop a series of pipes? something var def=someFunc(elem); var funcs=[func1, func2, func3]; var i=-1; while (i++<funcs.length) {def.pipe(funcs[i]);}
[02:38:18] <Whirl3d> maybe def=def.pipe(funcs[i])
[02:51:46] <sacho> huh?
[02:57:34] <selector> http://bpaste.net/show/Sb2jTAJ4e1kmtCjEdFHs/ - want to insert a rowspan after every first td in every table, but I can't. I started searching and made this code. It doesn't work, but may tell more about thing I need.
[02:59:29] <Whirl3d> $("table").each(function () {var tbl=$(this); var ftd=tbl.find("td:first"); td.after(rowspanhtml);});
[03:01:06] <mikkelb> Anybody good with RaphaelJS?
[03:13:39] <nisseni> I'm using .dialog, in this dialog I have an ajaxForm which opens a new view in a div. In that div I'm having a jquery crop plugin. The script doesn't seem to load. Running the same view outside the dialog works fine
[03:35:45] <|RicharD|> hello
[03:36:25] <Whirl3d> hello
[03:37:25] <|RicharD|> i have a problem with bind ajax:successÖ i have done this with coffee script: http://pastie.org/4060924
[03:37:39] <|RicharD|> anyway the first params data not have the response of call
[03:38:14] <|RicharD|> i'm wrong to use (data,status,xhr) ?
[03:40:36] <Whirl3d> that doesn't appear to be a valid method signature for bind
[03:40:41] <Whirl3d> ? bind
[03:40:42] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[03:41:28] <|RicharD|> for a ajax callback what is better use ? maybe bind isn't good
[03:41:33] <bot-t> |RicharD|, #11374 (Maybe jQuery v1.7.1 's a bug.) ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11374
[03:41:47] <Whirl3d> ignore that.
[03:41:57] <Whirl3d> bot-t gets excitable first thing in the morning.
[03:42:22] <Whirl3d> it's not that bind is or isn't the correct thing to use here, it's that you aren't using it correctly.
[03:42:40] <Whirl3d> bind should look like $(element).bind(event, handler)
[03:43:46] <Whirl3d> you have $(element).bind  'string', (malformed array maybe?) ->   ?
[03:47:56] <|RicharD|> umm no I'm seeing the docs
[03:48:33] <Whirl3d> cool. then you should have it squared away
[03:50:25] <|RicharD|> umh but with: $("#new_comment").bind 'ajax:success'
[03:50:30] <|RicharD|> i pass the events to bind method
[03:53:44] <Whirl3d> I've never seen it written like that
[03:53:51] <Whirl3d> so I am of no help
[03:54:16] <Whirl3d> I've never seen a jQuery method that didn't use () to encaps it's params
[03:55:11] <Whirl3d> and I wasn't aware that you could pass a string that looks like an object of sorts to the bind method without () and it would figure it out for you
[03:55:26] <Whirl3d> learn something new every day
[03:55:45] <poppiez> any way to do this using less methods? http://pastie.org/private/rrp3flcefvm8q6ngbgkraa
[03:56:02] <sahbeewah> it is coffeescript
[03:56:19] <sahbeewah> the malformed array are the args to an anonymous function
[03:56:40] <Whirl3d> I don't/haven't used coffeescript, so, like I said, I'm no help here
[03:56:41] <Whirl3d> sorry
[03:57:13] <Whirl3d> i didnt know they made jquery for coffeescript. LOL
[03:57:32] <Whirl3d> you'd think that would be coffeeQuery or something. LOL
[03:59:06] <scathen^C> hey guys, if i switch a div to contenteditable, it does it smoothly, but when switching contenteditable off any embedded content flickers. does anyone know of any reading i can do regarding this?
[03:59:15] <Whirl3d> pfew that's a lot of methods, poppiez...I mean you almost took up a full line of code with that...
[03:59:54] <poppiez> Whirl3d: I'm always trying to optimize my code as much as possible - don't see nothing wrong with thtat
[04:00:03] <Whirl3d> me neither
[04:01:39] <Whirl3d> all I can think is that you could use .map to iterate them. remove the page flip ones and show the others
[04:16:59] <Sebah> hello! does anybody knows if there's a script for jquery which does that mouse following thingie like on this page http://www.blacknegative.com/#!/sanofi/ ?
[04:18:34] <K3|Chris> what's the point?
[04:19:01] <Sebah> K3|Chris you talking to me?
[04:19:09] <K3|Chris> no, your mom
[04:19:36] <Sebah> K3|Chris there's no reason to be rude fella...
[04:20:13] <K3|Chris> easy enough to compare the mouse's coordinates compared to half the width and half the height of the page
[04:20:20] <K3|Chris> aka the middle
[04:21:46] <Sebah> yup, got it! thanks ( aside from the mom remark )
[04:22:39] <paullik> Hi. I have a question: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery somewhere down that page it says "// if you need the context of the original handler, use apply:" I don;t get that, can somebody explain what it means? I;m new to JS & jQuery
[04:23:11] <paullik> the context of handler is the global scope as I see there
[04:23:25] <paullik> but why would one need the context?
[04:23:35] <paullik> and how is the call different
[04:23:35] <sacho> no
[04:23:37] <sacho> it's not
[04:23:46] <sacho> you should learn what apply does
[04:23:58] <sacho> it's not really related to jquery
[04:24:00] <sacho> it's
[04:24:03] <sacho> just javascript.
[04:26:38] <paullik> ok, so the this argument there says to handler which object called the function right?
[04:27:03] <paullik> in this case the callback for click()
[04:27:38] <paullik> but isn't it the same thing with the above example (the one without apply)
[04:27:39] <paullik> ?
[04:30:14] <Whirl3d> paullik, setup a jsfiddle with both examples and add the line: console.log(this); in the middle
[04:30:26] <Whirl3d> it will show you the context of each handler
[04:31:53] <Whirl3d> And though those examples don't demonstrate it perfectly, it's much more obvious when you use an object literal to organize your functions and then you start getting "object object has no method...." ugg
[04:33:37] <Whirl3d> perhaps there is better information on the api.jquery pages rather than the docs.jquery pages as well.
[04:34:07] <Whirl3d> because I just noticed a link to the interface plugin v1.2   is that the beginning of jquery UI? wow
[04:35:05] <Whirl3d> 14 jan 2007...
[04:49:01] <paullik> Whirl3d, oook, got it now
[04:49:54] <paullik> the difference was the context where the handler saw the click event, on a specific link or on the whole window
[04:50:05] <paullik> sacho, Whirl3d ty
[04:57:13] <martisj> is there a way to temporarily disable/unbind an event from being triggered for the duration of an animation?
[04:58:20] <Posterdati> hi
[04:58:39] <Posterdati> please I need help writing code with jquery to make an svg pic clickable
[04:59:48] <martisj> Posterdati: that's very specific right there
[05:03:22] <Posterdati> martisj: ?
[05:20:19] <Whirl3d> martisj, which event are you talking about?
[05:20:27] <martisj> Whirl3d: inview
[05:20:51] <martisj> i saw an article about unbinding and that it had performance issues.
[05:20:53] <martisj> hmmm
[05:21:45] <martisj> We have a scrollTo plugin and it's acting up because the inview is firing during the scroll animation, thus the position indicator bounces around between the correct positions.
[05:21:53] <Posterdati> please I need help writing code with jquery to make an svg pic clickable
[05:22:00] <martisj> SO i want to hinder the event from firing when scrolling to a specific position
[05:22:07] <martisj> Posterdati: be more specific mate.
[05:22:14] <Whirl3d> inview is supposed to fire during the scroll. that's it's purpose
[05:22:16] <martisj> which part is not working
[05:22:22] <martisj> what have you tried and so forth
[05:22:48] <martisj> yes but i don't want to listen to it when the user has initiated a specific ScrollTo call.
[05:22:55] <Posterdati> martisj: I did a page with an svg on it (a map), then I'd like to add points as svg on the map svg
[05:23:25] <martisj> Whirl3d: as it is now the inview event would fire multiple times if the user was at the top of the page and clicked on the bottom scrollto button.
[05:23:32] <martisj> do you see what i'm sayhing?
[05:23:38] <Posterdati> those points have to be clickable: I added the jquery lib to load svg and I added some effects to the points like mouseover and mouseout
[05:23:41] <Whirl3d> you could set a variable on the scroll event and have inView check for that variable before handling it
[05:23:54] <Whirl3d> sure
[05:24:02] <martisj> Whirl3d: hmmm
[05:24:05] <martisj> interesting
[05:24:10] <martisj> i'll fiddle it
[05:24:18] <Whirl3d> so, whenever calling a "scrollTo" method, set a flag that inView can get to
[05:24:57] <martisj> oh yeah I like that :)
[05:25:00] <martisj> thanks Whirl3d
[05:25:10] <Whirl3d> and it says in the docs $("div").unbind("inview") should work
[05:25:17] <martisj> I had it on the tip of my tongue, nice to have someone yank it out of my face :)
[05:25:33] <martisj> Whirl3d: but isn't that a bit heavy unbinding and binding all the time?
[05:25:47] <Whirl3d> dont' do it all the time. LOL
[05:25:47] <martisj> better to just check the boolean in the event handler right?
[05:26:01] <Whirl3d> sure if you need to inView a lot
[05:27:21] <martisj> yeah
[05:27:26] <martisj> need to inview a lot :)
[05:27:29] <martisj> i think
[05:27:29] <martisj>  :D
[05:27:33] <martisj> what is al ot?
[05:27:37] <martisj> how much is a lot?
[05:32:20] <_DZ> guys have you ever experienced any weirdness with getting IE8 to recognize a 'mouseleave' event?  My scenario is this: I have a container div in which I've attached a mouseleave event to.  THe div contains a bunch of images.  WHen you leave the DIV the mouseleave event changes the opacity of all the images.  Some images those when hovered over pop up a tooltip.  THis is where the ie8 problem arises.  Moving outside of the contai
[05:32:20] <_DZ> ner div while over the tooltip does not register the mouseleave event for the div container in IE8.  Works fine in 9 & other browsers.  Any ideas?
[05:33:28] <Whirl3d> _DZ, post some code to jsfiddle so we can look at it
[05:34:00] <_DZ> whirl - alright give me a second
[05:34:43] <Whirl3d> Posterdati, did you setup a fiddle with your code?
[05:34:59] <Posterdati> what is a fiddle?
[05:36:06] <Whirl3d> go to jsfiddle.net...you'll see four panels: html js, cs, blank (result) put your html in the html, you javascript in the js and your css in the css panels and then click save. then share the url here
[05:36:28] <Posterdati> ok
[05:39:06] <Posterdati> http://jsfiddle.net/NEgkR/
[05:39:34] <Posterdati> but I don't know how to add the svg's
[05:41:02] <Whirl3d> okay, you are close..here's how you do this with plugins and such. See the addResources tab on the left, you add your plugins there.
[05:41:21] <martisj> Whirl3d: dude this is doing my head in.
[05:41:22] <Whirl3d> no need for anything except the body markup in the html panel
[05:46:08] <Whirl3d> anybody else getting weird errors in jsfiddle this am?
[05:46:46] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/Pcgan/
[05:46:51] <martisj> nope
[05:47:20] <martisj> the small round buttons should take you to the various parts of the page.
[05:47:31] <martisj> but it's jumping round or not updating when you scroll manually
[05:48:22] <Whirl3d> Posterdati, you are going to have to find wher eyou got the plugins for svg and see what's all required to make them work. It looks like you need aSingleton SVG Manager instance and a couple of other things...
[05:51:34] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: I've got jquery and svg plugins
[05:51:37] <Posterdati> what else?
[05:53:08] <Whirl3d> http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[05:53:24] <Whirl3d> did you look through all of this ? it's a lot to study
[05:54:16] <Whirl3d> And what is it that you are trying to accomplish?
[05:54:41] <Posterdati> a clickable svg image
[05:55:25] <Whirl3d> under the examples tab in the SVG Examples selector, choose interactivity and copy that code
[05:55:35] <Posterdati> ?
[05:55:37] <Posterdati> where?
[05:55:57] <Whirl3d> http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[05:56:16] <Posterdati> ok
[05:57:05] <Posterdati> I got a size changing red circle
[05:57:19] <_DZ> Whirl - sorry about the delay, had to get all the images and stuff setup somewhere: http://breakdown.menasor.com/tiles/Tests/new/Index.html
[05:58:15] <Whirl3d> that's a clickable svg. Use that code to figure yours out. Replace his svg with yours, etc.
[05:58:25] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: shall I take the SVG jQuery code?
[05:58:32] <Whirl3d> _DZ_ np
[05:58:45] <Whirl3d> I'd take it all until I understood it
[05:59:18] <_DZ> the line in question is line 66 in the jsquares js (which is the jsqures plugin i did some mods too)
[05:59:22] <Whirl3d> _DZ, what's the issue now?
[05:59:38] <_DZ> so the issue is i have a mouseleave event attached the js-container div
[05:59:41] <_DZ> which contains all the tiles
[05:59:49] <_DZ> some images pop up tooltips as u can see
[06:00:04] <_DZ> in IE8 when you exit the container DIV while a tooltip is up
[06:00:12] <_DZ> the mouseleave on the js-container doenst fire
[06:00:31] <_DZ> i assume its getting confused since the tooltip is 'up over' the js-container div?
[06:00:35] <Whirl3d> probably because your tooltip is handling the mouseleave event and returning false
[06:00:57] <Whirl3d> then the event never propogates to the parent
[06:01:06] <_DZ> the tooltip does have a mouseleave event handler yes, that removes its visibility
[06:01:51] <_DZ> its just calling $('#js-overlay-id-' + index).remove(); in its mouseleave
[06:01:58] <_DZ> which just removes the tooltip from the screen
[06:02:12] <_DZ> im not explicitly returning false tho
[06:02:19] <_DZ> so wouldnt propagation continue?
[06:02:28] <_DZ> and this is only happening in IE8
[06:02:52] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: this example didn't work either I already tested it, scripting in the svg seems to not work
[06:03:16] <Whirl3d> Posterdati, you are gonna have to find another way to do whatever it is you are doing
[06:03:45] <Posterdati> ehehe I know...
[06:04:10] <Posterdati> onmouseover and onmouseout actually working
[06:04:36] <Whirl3d> than wtf, why you gonna sit here and spam the funk out of everyone here...making it sound like you got a gun to your head if we don't help and then " eheh I know...actually it works.."
[06:04:40] <Whirl3d> comeon
[06:05:21] <Posterdati> what
[06:05:46] <Posterdati> I told you that on mouse over and out works but onclick seems dead and I don't know why
[06:05:50] <Whirl3d> DZ_ gimme just a minute
[06:06:02] <_DZ> sure thing Whirl
[06:10:15] <m8> Hi, how i can make a GET call passing data with .load() function?
[06:10:39] <m8> if i pass a data = {'item': item}, there will be a POST call
[06:16:41] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: I added onclick in the svg and it didn't work, so may the event be captured by another object?
[06:22:17] <puchacz> hi, how do I add gray text to a input type="text" as a hint? like here, right side: http://jqueryhints.codeplex.com/
[06:22:25] <_DZ> if you call .remove() on an element does it stop propagation upwards through the DOM?
[06:22:34] <puchacz> it says: "Search Wiki & Documentation"
[06:24:12] <puchacz> (got it I think)
[06:35:16] <sahbeewah> _DZ: no, it doesn't
[06:35:30] <_DZ> sah - its exhibiting that problem in IE8
[06:36:09] <_DZ> i have a tooltip im calling .remove on itself on mouseleave
[06:36:22] <_DZ> and the mouseleave isnt propagating up to a div i have mouseleave attached to
[06:36:38] <_DZ> no issues with IE9 or other browsers
[06:37:05] <_DZ> if i call .hide() on itself rather then .remove(), the event propagates up correctly
[06:37:21] <_DZ> but I want to call .remove()  (I also tried .detach(), same problem)
[06:40:07] <sahbeewah> sorry i don't have ie8 to test, maybe someone else can help you
[06:41:46] <martisj> I'm trying to achieve a scroll to effect with an indicator showing which element is in view. and the problem is when the screen is big two elements of the different parts and inview at the same time and the last always "wins".
[06:42:00] <martisj> i.e showing the indicator at one spot below the top.
[06:42:07] <rethus> tach
[06:50:24] <ScottG> Could $('p').find('em') be shortened to $('p em') ?
[07:01:35] <rethus> ScottG: tas - but i think yes
[07:01:57] <ScottG> tas?
[07:04:37] <rethus> try and see
[07:04:47] <rethus> maybe jsfiddle.net
[07:26:37] <Afflicto> How can I remove a div without removing its children?
[07:33:11] <rethus> get the content of the div, save it in a js-var, and asign it to the parent element of your div, than remove your div
[07:38:28] <tmerrill99s> darn it!  I've got this working in jquery 1.6.4 but the selected attribute refuses to get set in 1.4.4 (which is the version I need this to work in).

[08:48:20] <christo_m> yoDon: why wouldnt it be $(this)
[08:48:34] <christo_m> console.log both of them see which ones undefined
[09:01:43] <tmerrill99s> alright.  is this a jquery bug?  (in 1.4.4?) You can't set the 'selected' attribute on a dropdown's option????  http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/41/
[09:02:02] <tmerrill99s> ^ it works in 1.6.x.  not in 1.4.4.

[09:08:20] <poncha> hi. i've got some trouble with :visible selector... take a look: http://pastebin.com/ceBU4e4B <- #container has fixed width and height and overflow:hidden; #slider has absolute position and left: -1000px , however, when i fetch $('#slider').children(':visible') i get all of the items, not just those really visible on screen
[09:08:28] <poncha> what am i missing?
[09:33:33] <tmerrill99s> damn!  disconnected.  (go century link....sigh).  jquery bug in 1.4.4?  can't set selected attribute of drop down?  http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/41/
[09:37:47] <thomedy> ithink there is something im missing about the details of the dom right now
[09:38:13] <thomedy> because straight out i feel like what i have created should work provided its a simple event
[09:38:22] <thomedy> but tthere must be a missing detail

[10:17:54] <shoky> oops
[10:17:58] <shoky> i meant tmerrill99s
[10:19:15] <thomedy> yeah it wasn't quite right
[10:19:24] <thomedy> it was off just a bit and i need perfect but its good now
[10:19:38] <thomedy> i was lazy in my selector and now im  better
[10:19:40] <thomedy> but thank you
[10:19:50] <abjorn> sacho: yeah, 12 <.< >.> IT'S BEEN A LONG WEEK OKAY
[10:40:52] <thomedy> is anyone here i could use some help and im not sure what to google cuz i dont know what the problem is
[10:41:00] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[10:41:22] <unomystEz> I want to do an light asynchronous POST when a user clicks on a hyperlink.  is using the ajax() function the recommended way?  I don't need to return any data, just perform the POST
[10:47:26] <thomedy> is anyone working im stumped
[10:51:17] <species> HERROW
[10:53:16] <species> thomedy: the suits container seems to have rolled over the end of the line.
[10:53:26] <thomedy> agreed
[10:53:29] <thomedy> i just dont know why
[10:53:31] <species> thomedy: this uses css right?
[10:53:37] <species> i would blame that
[10:53:39] <thomedy> css the event
[10:53:44] <thomedy> or effect i mean
[10:53:49] <thomedy> im using animate
[10:53:50] <species> but what about before the event runs?
[10:53:51] <thomedy> and css
[10:53:54] <thomedy> yeah
[10:53:59] <thomedy> css before and then animates
[10:54:15] <species> if you disable the animation does it look right
[10:54:24] <thomedy> yeah
[10:54:30] <thomedy> it looks great
[10:54:38] <thomedy> cuz its all %'s
[10:54:45] <thomedy> so its perfect
[10:54:51] <thomedy> the css is fairly straight forward
[11:03:44] <granden> Hi, got a bit of a strange problem, this website, http://europeantrophy.com/mobile/site/index2.php it gets a box at the bottom where it says
[11:03:47] <granden> loading
[11:03:55] <granden> But looking at the source code it is no where to be found.
[11:05:15] <ryanaz> ok so it would have been nice to know that buttonset()'s don't automatically update when you set their attr('checked', true) ... and you have to re-run buttonset() ...
[11:05:24] <ryanaz> coulda used the last two hours of my life for something else.
[11:05:35] <ryanaz> am I missing something?  Or is that how it works?
[11:09:06] <ryanaz> anyone here used buttonset before?    Apparently you have to re-run it if you change the attr()'s to true or false or else it won't update the display??
[11:09:14] <shoky> ryanaz here's a paste from some of my code :P :
[11:09:15] <shoky>             setTimeout(function() { $('#actionRadioDiv').buttonset(); }, 0);
[11:09:17] <shoky> er
[11:09:29] <ryanaz> shoky: what's that for?
[11:09:31] <shoky> first line was supposed to be:  // i'm not sure why jqueryui doesn't redraw the buttonset automatically
[11:09:31] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[11:09:45] <thomedy> my animation is almost there but my last container floats when i click a link
[11:09:50] <thomedy> and rols to the bottom
[11:09:59] <ryanaz> shoky: so the browser is constantly updating buttonset?
[11:10:10] <tw2113> brief writeup on $.data() vs $.attr(), not my own, just sharing http://www.peterbe.com/plog/data-and-attr-in-jquery
[11:10:13] <shoky> ryanaz nah i run that only when i need to refresh it
[11:10:19] <shoky> ryanaz like you said..
[11:10:21] <ryanaz> got it..
[11:10:35] <ryanaz> shoky: dumb
[11:10:44] <shoky> yeah or maybe we're both missing something ;P
[11:10:45] <ryanaz> like I said .. coulda' used the last two hours of my life back
[11:11:17] <ryanaz> i was ripping my code to shreads until finally by dumb luck I went and looked at the element in the page and saw it said "checked" but the button wasn't pressed
[11:11:32] <ryanaz> I was like... "mother ......"
[11:11:50] <shoky> yea it took me a while too
[11:12:28] <Lyfesaver> btww shoky, i have moved that code all over my site... and it works perfectly every i use it =)
[11:12:33] <ryanaz> right now all I'm doing is re caling:     $('#fuel_options').buttonset();
[11:12:40] <Lyfesaver> everywhere* I use it
[11:12:42] <shoky> sweet Lyfesaver ;>
[11:12:42] <ryanaz> I don't know why you need a timeout thing on it
[11:13:01] <granden> Anyone know why I get a loading box at the bottom of this page? http://www.europeantrophy.com/mobile/site/index2.php?
[11:13:11] <granden> I dont have anything that should generate one.
[11:13:13] <shoky> ryanaz i needed it in my case, didn't mean to say that you need it to
[11:13:14] <shoky> too
[11:13:17] <thomedy> okay thats it i got no more ideas
[11:13:27] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[11:13:42] <ryanaz> shoky : what's the difference? just a slight delay?
[11:13:50] <thomedy> my animation floats the last div to the bottom
[11:13:58] <thomedy> which is less than ideal
[11:15:02] <shoky> ryanaz: i ran that code inside a callback which ran just before the actual checked attribute was set, or something. so without the "timeout" it would run synchronously with the old value
[11:15:08] <granden> anyone?
[11:15:30] <shoky> granden: what loading box
[11:15:39] <shoky> oh
[11:15:40] <ryanaz> shoky: makes sense.
[11:16:00] <shoky> weird, didnt load css until i refreshed
[11:16:17] <granden> shoky: You dont get any at that url?
[11:16:28] <granden> At the bottom of that page there is a box where it says, loading
[11:16:29] <granden> for me
[11:16:44] <granden> http://europeantrophy.com/mobile/site/index2.php
[11:16:48] <granden> Check it now?
[11:17:16] <shoky> yea i see it
[11:17:24] <shoky> i think its the jq mobile
[11:17:33] <granden> hmm
[11:17:40] <granden> damn it, why would it add that.
[11:18:21] <unomystEz> in my a tag's onclick action, I'm calling $.post() but it seems the connection doesn't stay open long enough to complete, is there a way to wait until the post returns before continuing with the click?
[11:19:59] <ryanaz> what's the syntax to do a for loop on a group of id's like:   #so_type_*  ?
[11:21:56] <shoky> granden i guess you need $.mobile.loading( 'hide' )
[11:21:58] <shoky> donno why
[11:22:38] <shoky> ryanaz there's no "syntax" for that..
[11:23:06] <ryanaz> shoky:  you can't do anything with "#so_type_* "   ?
[11:23:11] <shoky> if you've selected them in a jq obj you can just do .each  ..
[11:23:21] <ryanaz> how do you select them ?
[11:23:47] <granden> shoky: Ok, will try it, strange though.
[11:24:16] <thomedy> okay... i am going to ask.. i have an animation that is almost complete in its appearance...
[11:24:26] <shoky> ryanaz:  $('[id^=so_type_]')  i guess
[11:24:41] <ryanaz> it doesn't need a * after that?
[11:24:43] <thomedy> but my problem is i click a link and then the last div breaks off from the herd and then goes to the bottome
[11:24:44] <ryanaz> is it regex?
[11:24:44] <thomedy> no good
[11:24:58] <shoky> ryanaz: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[11:25:17] <ryanaz> nice.
[11:25:24] <granden> shoky: Added that, still loads :(
[11:25:35] <granden> rather, still showing message for loading.
[11:25:48] <shoky> granden: not that i see any, but do you have any ajax loading in that page?
[11:26:06] <shoky> oh, there is ajax
[11:26:24] <shoky> er
[11:26:30] <shoky> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'loading'
[11:26:52] <shoky> you're using an old jq mobile
[11:27:02] <shoky> try  $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg();   instead  ;S
[11:28:33] <granden> shoky: Hmm no ajax, just some php to connect to a mysql db, retrive some data, and then generate the list of news.
[11:28:54] <shoky> yea i got confusd by ajax-loader.gif
[11:29:27] <granden> maybe the links that points to non mobile sites needs that thing added to them
[11:29:31] <granden> dont remember what its called.
[11:30:07] <granden> rel="external" thing
[11:30:15] <granden> or data-ajax="false"
[11:30:44] <ner0x> Using json, do you *need* double quotes around all params?
[11:31:53] <granden> shoky: Hmm, really strange, added both of those, that hidePageLoadingMsg and it is still showing up
[11:31:56] <tw2113> aren't they getting more strict with json formatting?
[11:32:06] <ner0x> I thought they were.
[11:33:01] <ner0x> But I do it the "correct" way, still doesn't work. I'm wondering if the never jquery broke jstree.
[11:34:14] <shoky> granden: yea.. sorry i dont rly know jq mobile
[11:34:28] <granden> ok thanksy anyway
[11:41:18] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I bind event for $('#connection'), but not inside $('#wrapper')? HTML: <div id="container"><div id="wrapper"></div></div>
[11:43:47] <ryanaz> shoky:  Why isn't this working?   $('[id^=so_type_]').attr('checked',true);
[11:44:06] <shoky> tomoyuki28jp: you can check event.target inside the handler
[11:44:19] <tomoyuki28jp> shoky: thanks!
[11:45:14] <shoky> ryanaz: it does..
[11:45:41] <ryanaz> shoky: mm

[11:55:47] <ryanaz> shoky: hit by the buttonset() stick again... lol
[11:55:54] <Es0teric> eventhough that was kinda douche
[11:55:55] <arungpt> systemfault: im thinking about sending the url and then working from there
[11:55:56] <systemfault> arungpt: What people usually do in your case is to use an hidden iframe
[11:55:56] <Es0teric> that was still funny
[11:55:57] <ryanaz> systemfault:  hey there
[11:56:08] <systemfault> ryanaz: Hey :)

[12:46:29] <mansuk> Hi all, I am trying to build a dom Inspector like firebug using jquery. After some googling, I found that the right way to highlight an element on a page on a mouseover is to size it and them "move it to rect.lect and rect.top" etc.. I am wondering how I can move a div in jquery? The whole algo I am trying to implement is here http://pastebin.com/2tya9bbL
[12:48:31] <gowie> Hey all, I am new to jQuery, and js in general but more so to jquery, but I am writing a jqm app with backbone js and am running into trouble. I have things working in a hacked together kind of way but I am running into problems with emptying a list view, populating it with data with from a backbone collection, and then calling .listview('refresh') on it. I am using pushState, and so it doesn't like .ready() function is what I want to
[12:48:31] <gowie> be using. I am basically wondering how I should deal with calling 'refresh' once the dom is updated with my data and jqm is ready.
[12:48:37] <gowie> Anybody have any ideas?
[12:49:26] <mansuk> Corrected version... I am trying to build a dom Inspector like firebug using jquery. After some googling, I found that the right way to highlight an element without altering page layout is to inject 4 divs, size them to bounding rect on a page and then "move it to rect.lect and rect.top" etc.. I am wondering how I can move a div in jquery/css/js? The whole algo I am trying to implement is here http://pastebin.com/2tya9bbL
[12:52:32] <shoky> mansuk you can move a div with $('div').css({left: 0, top: 0})
[12:54:21] <mansuk> shoky: thanks so in this case I say $('div).css({left:rect.left, top:rect.top}) for above move it to rect left and rect top?
[12:54:43] <shoky> if that's where you wanna move it, sure
[12:55:02] <shoky> and you need to actually select the div you wanna move.. not just $('div')
[12:55:44] <mansuk> shoky: ok also is $(div).css({left:0}; $(div).css({top:0}; same as $('div).css({left:rect.left, top:rect.top})
[12:55:55] <shoky> hm
[12:55:58] <shoky> ? no
[12:55:59] <bot-t> http://smplstk.ca/_/no.gif
[12:56:38] <mansuk> shoky:  ok no worries... thanks...
[13:11:38] <andrewhl> If I have a div.dropdown > h2, and I want to toggle a sibling div.dropdown-text (just beneath it) using .slideToggle, how do I tell jQuery to only toggle 'this' + .dropdown-text? So it only toggles the sibling of the clicked H2, and not all elements with .dropdown-text?
[13:24:38] <shoky> andrewhl: $(this).next('.dropdown-text')
[13:43:51] <Chirag> hooloowoo: you there?
[13:45:32] <Chirag> Can anyone help me? Its regarding $.getJSON.
[13:46:58] <systemfault> Ask...
[13:47:38] <Chirag> I have problem working with loop in $.getJSON()
[13:49:15] <Chirag> for(var i=0, j=items.length; i<j; i++) { 			$("#i").append(items[i]); 	//<---This is not working	}. Any idea what's wrong?
[13:49:31] <BinaryKitten> yep
[13:49:41] <BinaryKitten> $('#i').append(items)
[13:50:09] <Chirag> Ok. Let me check it
[13:50:10] <BinaryKitten> you don't need to add each item, just add them all
[13:50:26] <AskMP> depends what items are
[13:50:52] <BinaryKitten> if you can append 1, in a loop like that, then you can append all
[13:51:19] <Es0teric> i have a $.each() looping through  a variable that has an array... how do i reference properties in the loop more than once to display the info in them?
[13:51:21] * BinaryKitten returns to her game
[13:51:49] <Chirag> BinaryKitten : Its not working yet
[13:52:42] <Chirag> AskMP: any idea?
[13:52:59] <AskMP> what are the array items of the ‚Äúitems‚Äù variable?
[13:53:03] <AskMP> are they dom elements?
[13:53:48] <Chirag> They are array elements
[13:54:52] <AskMP> are you wanting to append the contents of the arrays to the DOM #i?
[13:54:54] <Chirag> AskMP: They are coming from a jSON file
[13:55:12] <AskMP> yes, but I want to see what it is that you are looping over and trying to add to the contents.
[13:56:01] <Chirag> ASkMP: They are checkboxes
[13:56:32] <Chirag> AskMP: Should I provide the URL?
[13:56:56] <AskMP> so the JSON is an array of HTML strings like: ‚Äú<input type="checkbox" ‚Ä¶ />‚Äù?
[13:57:10] <AskMP> or is it just IDs and the data to make them?
[13:57:11] <Es0teric> when looping through an array of objects, how do you reference the property more than once? because if i do obj.prop1 + " " + obj.prop2, it shows the content for prop2 but the content for prop1 ends up as [object, object]
[13:57:37] <Chirag> Ids and data
[13:57:59] <AskMP> Then you need to create the input DOM element in query and then append it
[13:58:24] <Chirag> Like?
[13:58:37] <Chirag> Can you give e.g.?
[13:59:11] <AskMP> $('<input type="checkbox" id="' + item[i].id + '" name="‚Ä¶" />').appendTo('#i');
[13:59:32] <AskMP> simply add the attributes you need to the input field then appendTo
[14:00:11] <Chirag> If I write outside the loop, they work fine.
[14:00:11] <AskMP> Somebody may have a more efficient way but that should solve your problem.
[14:00:44] <AskMP> is item[i*n] an object?
[14:01:12] <Chirag> $.getJSON('myjSon.json', function(data) { 		var items = [];				   		$.each(data, function(key, value) { 			items.push('<input type="checkbox" id= "' + key + '" />' + value); 		});
[14:01:22] <Chirag> Check out the statements
[14:01:38] <Es0teric> uh... i wonder how do i solve my problem..
[14:03:14] <Chirag> AskMP: Should I delete the statement $.each & and write as you stated?
[14:04:06] <Chirag> Es0teric : Any idea?
[14:04:54] <Es0teric> Chirag, i am just trying to access properties in an object more than once in an $.each() loop
[14:05:11] <Es0teric> there are two different properties i want to access in an object
[14:05:22] <Chirag> Hmm
[14:05:37] <Chirag> Which are they?
[14:05:50] <tw2113> why not jsfiddle
[14:05:55] <AskMP> instead of items.push, use $('#i').append('‚Ä¶');
[14:05:55] <Es0teric> Chirag well i am looping through multiple objects
[14:06:12] <Es0teric> Chirag plus, i am using the lastfm api
[14:06:20] <Es0teric> so i want track name, and track artist
[14:06:35] <Es0teric> *song name, song artist, album art
[14:06:40] <tw2113> mmm last.fm
[14:07:27] <Chirag> AskMP : ok. Let me check
[14:07:40] <Es0teric> whats up tw2113
[14:07:52] <tw2113> just throwing in random comments
[14:08:08] <Es0teric> i see
[14:08:25] <tw2113> but the jsfiddle part was legit advice
[14:09:40] <AskMP> Chirag: so?
[14:09:45] <Es0teric> yeah i know, tw2113 but i am using the lastfm api like i said
[14:09:48] <tw2113> if you're worried about your API key, i'm sure you could get a new one later if necessary
[14:09:57] <Es0teric> i have one
[14:10:02] <Es0teric> i am using ajax long polling for this
[14:10:06] <tw2113> and how is that stopping you? you're using js right?
[14:10:07] <Chirag> AskMP : Its not working
[14:10:51] <Es0teric> dude... its simple -- loop through the array of objects, when i access multiple properties in the same object one property shows up and the other shows up as [object, object]
[14:11:08] <tw2113> doesn't mean it's necessarily simple to debug
[14:11:40] <vandunk> Hello.. Not sure if this is the place to ask.. I'm using isotope to build a sort of image gallery. I need to randomly select 40 images from 70 artists (no duplicates), then choose one of their images to display (each has a varying amount) . At the moment I am using single table in a mysql database to store their names and number of images. I'm trying to retrieve 50 names (and one number each) at once using php, then place them into individua
[14:12:53] <Chirag> If I write 		for(var i=0, j=items.length; i<j; i++) { 			$("#i").append(items); 		} Its not working. But if I write: $('#1').append(items[0]); 		$('#2').append(items[1]);. Its working. Hows that possible?
[14:13:05] <Es0teric> damn i love textexpander...
[14:13:07] <Es0teric> so userful
[14:13:10] <Es0teric> *useful
[14:14:11] <Es0teric> here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/AWP9k/
[14:14:20] <AskMP> I haven‚Äôt forgot you Chirag, I‚Äôm making a pastbin‚Ä¶
[14:14:41] <AskMP> OH!
[14:14:48] <Chirag> AskMP : What?
[14:14:50] <Es0teric> updated http://jsfiddle.net/AWP9k/1/
[14:15:09] <AskMP> take your first selector out of the quotes‚Ä¶
[14:15:21] <AskMP> $('#' + i).append
[14:15:35] <Chirag> Wait
[14:16:09] <AskMP> or at least $('#' + (i + 1)) since you are starting with 0
[14:18:37] <Chirag> AskMP : I owe you a beer. Thanks. It worked. What a silly mistake it was!. I sholud have taken care of the same.
[14:19:16] <AskMP> Sorry, would have had it earlier but I thought you had a DOM element with an id of ‚Äúi‚Äù
[14:19:38] <AskMP> event still with a numeral like that, I would recommend not having only a number as an ID
[14:19:52] <AskMP> have what the item is plus ‚Äú-‚Äù plus the number
[14:20:17] <AskMP> ‚ÄúawesomeListItem-1‚Äù
[14:20:19] <AskMP> as an example
[14:20:39] <Chirag> NP buddy. "Der aaye durust aaye". & I'll take care of the thing you just wrote
[14:21:10] <arungpt> can i ask a dumb question? trying to select the image types in this html doc with jquery https://gist.github.com/2907366. for some reason cant do it. can someone else verify that im not crazy?
[14:21:31] <arungpt> is my first jquery function totally off?
[14:21:58] <Chirag> AskMP: Is there anything I can help you with?
[14:22:30] <AskMP> Nope‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm in 7 rooms just helping others out‚Ä¶ where I can.
[14:23:27] <Chirag> AskMP : You are doing a great job. Keep It UP dude. Can I ask your name?
[14:24:02] <AskMP> Chirag: it‚Äôs in my info‚Ä¶ Also, AskMP is my web alias for most things too.
[14:24:32] <AskMP> arungpt: try input[type="image"]
[14:25:23] <arungpt> AskMP: no good unfortunately. the weird thing is its working in jsfiddle

[14:25:32] <Chirag> Potter as in Harry Potter! Just kidding . Thanks a lot anyway bro
[14:26:14] <arungpt> but i cant get it working on my web page
[14:26:25] <Chirag> AskMP : Bye have a nice weekend Matthew
[14:26:53] <AskMP> $('.images input[type="image"]').click(‚Ä¶
[14:26:58] <AskMP> that didn‚Äôt work?
[14:27:02] <AskMP> By Chirag
[14:27:10] <AskMP> Bye*
[14:27:25] <arungpt> AskMP: nope :9
[14:27:27] <arungpt> :(
[14:27:28] <DukeDrake> hi
[14:27:50] <DukeDrake> a webservice offers to request data via JSON
[14:28:11] <DukeDrake> but isn't crossdomain ajax ... problematic?
[14:28:14] <arungpt> AskMP: any idea why it would be working in jsfiddle btu not my site?
[14:29:01] <AskMP> Are there any console errors on your site version?
[14:29:19] <arungpt> nope
[14:30:20] <ragnok> hi, what frontend developers javascript/jquery ppl usually use as a backend for that lil functionality?
[14:31:35] <AskMP> That is a strange on arungpt, I don‚Äùt know what to say‚Ä¶ aside from‚Ä¶ is there anything else that may be capturing the click of inputs that may be loaded or running after? I notice that the jsFiddle isn‚Äôt a complete HTML document.
[14:32:13] <arungpt> AskMP: its not complete?
[14:32:21] <arungpt> it should be the whole thing
[14:32:51] <AskMP> No closing body or html tags‚Ä¶
[14:33:01] <ragnok> should i use php? i see most of tutorials out there with ajax for php...
[14:34:09] <AskMP> Are you sure that you are pasting in all your code into jsFiddle?
[14:34:37] <AskMP> ragnok: it is what I use
[14:35:09] <ragnok> mm, it seems that the learning curve goes toward that
[14:35:15] <shoky> ragnok if you dont know php then no you shouldn't ;S
[14:35:24] <shoky> if all you know is javascript, try node.js
[14:35:24] <gloomer> ragnok, its really just preference
[14:35:30] <arungpt> AskMP: oh i see some api stuff got left off at the end. i added it in but still works http://jsfiddle.net/S5BcW/2/
[14:36:21] <ragnok> well, i just want to focus in the frontend really, i don't like backend. i just need something to give that LIL functionality
[14:38:22] <AskMP> Interesting arungpt , it works on my local‚Ä¶
[14:38:28] <arungpt> arghhh lol
[14:38:43] <arungpt> im going to try restarting my server
[14:38:48] <arungpt> what selector are you using?
[14:38:54] <AskMP> your original
[14:39:44] <AskMP> Remove all those javascript loaded elements in the header and try again.
[14:39:56] <AskMP> all the ones that are /assets‚Ä¶
[14:40:05] <arungpt> ok will do
[14:40:20] <AskMP> If it works, add them back, one at a time to see where and if there is a conflict
[14:40:41] <arungpt> nope, still no love
[14:41:04] <arungpt> lol i feel like im going insane
[14:41:44] <AskMP> Just so I am clear, it should be running the console.log("help!"); correct?
[14:41:51] <AskMP> and in your version it isn‚Äôt?
[14:41:51] <arungpt> yup
[14:41:55] <arungpt> thats right
[14:42:00] <AskMP> yea, every version I try, it works great
[14:42:02] <AskMP> what browser?
[14:42:09] <arungpt> chrome
[14:42:13] <arungpt> let me try safari
[14:42:14] <AskMP> ‚àö
[14:42:22] <AskMP> chrome
[14:42:41] <AskMP> I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you‚Ä¶
[14:42:46] <AskMP> should have worked.
[14:42:50] <AskMP> It works in jsf
[14:42:54] <arungpt> so weird right?
[14:42:56] <AskMP> it works on my local.
[14:43:12] <AskMP> ‚Äúhave you tried turning it off and on?‚Äù
[14:43:17] <arungpt> hahaha
[14:43:27] <arungpt> maybe ill restart my machine
[14:43:39] <arungpt> or maybe ill just go watch it crowd instead
[14:43:55] <arungpt> still nothing in safari!
[14:43:59] <AskMP> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing right now‚Ä¶
[14:44:08] <arungpt> haha nice
[14:44:20] <AskMP> 0205 smoke and mirrors
[14:44:43] <arungpt> sweet
[14:44:57] <arungpt> ghosts in the machines man
[14:46:37] <AskMP> ‚ÄúWho am I? I‚Äùm a ghost, I‚Äôm a shadow, pffffttt‚Ä¶‚Äù
[14:47:05] <arungpt> ahh tried a server/chrome restart
[14:47:07] <arungpt> nothing
[14:47:10] <arungpt> this is the worst
[14:47:21] <arungpt> i feel like the past couple days of dev nothing has gone right
[14:47:25] <arungpt> \rant
[14:47:39] <arungpt> now i cant even get this simple thing to work
[14:48:41] <arungpt> AskMP: can i try selecting everything with a src attribute?
[14:49:06] <AskMP> you can but try not to‚Ä¶
[14:49:09] <AskMP> that would be a lot
[14:49:17] <arungpt> well all images right?
[14:49:23] <arungpt> yeah thats dumb
[14:49:29] <arungpt> grrr
[14:49:39] <arungpt> other elements on the page work
[14:49:59] <arungpt> can i launch jquery from inside html?
[14:50:05] <arungpt> i want to scroll to the top
[14:50:10] <arungpt> when the image gets clicked
[14:50:26] <AskMP> why not just $('.images input')?
[14:50:36] <arungpt> can i put an onclick = window.scrollTo in the html?
[14:50:40] <arungpt> ill try that
[14:51:15] <arungpt> AskMP: no good
[14:51:28] <arungpt> AskMP: i wonder if its because those images are coming in from a .load() call?
[14:51:43] <AskMP> ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[14:51:46] <arungpt> maybe i should try putting the script on that page
[14:51:51] <arungpt> oh is that it
[14:51:53] <AskMP> are you running the ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[14:51:56] <AskMP> yea
[14:51:59] <AskMP> that‚Äôll do it
[14:52:05] <arungpt> god damn lol
[14:52:07] <arungpt> im an idiot
[14:53:00] <arungpt> AHH  it still isnt working
[14:53:59] <AskMP> Just for giggles, use $('.images input:image').live('click', function‚Ä¶
[14:54:57] <arungpt> THAT WORKED
[14:54:59] <arungpt> AskMP: why?
[14:55:25] <AskMP> because you are creating event listeners for items that don‚Äôt exist, then making the elements‚Ä¶
[14:55:55] <AskMP> if you waiting until after you‚Äôve added the DOM elements into the document, then created the click event listener, it should work
[14:55:57] <engaged> How can I change which radio button i selected (they have separate id's and same class)
[15:00:28] <arungpt> AskMP: why does it matter when you create the event listeners if youre calling them after the elements have been created?
[15:00:49] <arungpt> AskMP: should when you reference them be more important then when they were created?
[15:00:57] <arungpt> shouldnt*
[15:01:12] <AskMP> you can‚Äôt reference something that doesn‚Äôt exist yet
[15:01:28] <arungpt> but its not actually being referenced until the click event right?
[15:01:37] <arungpt> the code is just sitting there, its not being run
[15:01:47] <arungpt> (i know im wrong, just trying to understand)
[15:03:37] <AskMP> You can‚Äôt create event listeners for items if they don‚Äòt exist yet. It‚Äôs like saying: tell me when somebody picks up all the pencils that are sitting on the table‚Ä¶ you then look to see no pencils and think: ‚ÄúSure, that‚Äôs easy!‚Äù then somebody drops a box of pencils on the table. You would say, well those pencils weren‚Äôt in the list of pencils I have to watch!‚Äù
[15:03:50] <arungpt> ahhhh i see
[15:03:56] <arungpt> that makes perfect sense
[15:04:02] <arungpt> thank you!
[15:04:06] <AskMP> np
[15:04:19] <arungpt> the second thing you said, "if you waiting until after you‚Äôve added the DOM elements into the document, then created the click event listener, it should work"
[15:04:23] <arungpt> is that possible?
[15:04:53] <AskMP> after you run the load function, run the listener.
[15:05:00] <arungpt> ah smart
[15:05:26] <arungpt> does it have to be nested inside the load, or just after it?
[15:06:06] <AskMP> You can have it afterwards for sure, but make sure that it is indeed after they have been made. If you are running the function async then they may not be made yet
[15:06:33] <arungpt> oh interesting how do i know if im doing asynch?
[15:06:37] <AskMP> If you are creating the dom elements via javascript, you should be able to create the listener.
[15:08:26] <AskMP> Have a callback in the load to run a new function that does the event listening once the dom elements have been completely loaded
[15:09:08] <AskMP> the second variable in the load() function is the callback area.
[15:09:44] <arungpt> would you mind showing me some example code? https://gist.github.com/2907494
[15:13:37] <AskMP> try this: https://gist.github.com/2907507
[15:17:53] <vandunk> Can anyone suggest a way to generate masonry/isotope items with random class names from a list of words? The words have to have a corresponding random number which has a variable range depending on the word.
[15:18:11] <vandunk> As in, how do I store/retrieve that information?
[15:21:03] <arungpt> AskMP: that works! thanks, i feel like i understand it much better now!
[15:21:44] <AskMP> good luck

[15:26:13] <systemfault> Someone flooding with nice words‚Ä¶. :/
[15:33:43] <Guest_> hi
[15:34:03] <Guest_> any1 has any idea wen the plugins site will b up
[15:37:41] <Guest_> any alternative source for jquery plugins
[15:38:11] <godbyk> I have two dropdown boxes and a link on my website.
[15:38:12] <godbyk> The contents of the second dropdown box are replaced when you select a different item in the first dropdown box. This part is working well.
[15:38:12] <godbyk> I'd like to now find which item is selected (by default) in the second dropdown box and use that value to change the link URL.
[15:38:12] <godbyk> Is there a way to change the link URL at the same time as the second dropdown box is populated?
[15:43:36] <JayKaa> godbyk, how dyu populate the second dropbox?
[15:43:52] <godbyk> JakeSays: It's populated with the results of an ajax function.
[15:44:27] <JayKaa> well, cant u change the .attr('href') of the link in the same ajax function?
[15:46:30] <godbyk> JayKaa: After the ajax call returns, I read the .val() of the dropdown box, but it refers to the previous value (of the old dropdown contents).
[15:47:04] <tomoyuki28jp> why textarea.val() returns placeholder?
[15:47:43] <tomoyuki28jp> sorry I was wrong.
[15:48:28] <JayKaa> godbyk, are u using asynchronous requests?
[15:49:13] <godbyk> JayKaa: It appears so.
[15:50:26] <godbyk> JayKaa: I see in the documentation that async: false is deprecated. What's the proper method to use synchronous requests now?
[15:51:25] <Storm3y> Hi, I have multiple images on my website, I'm wondering if anyone has any JQuery code that would resize the image to a certain size keeping it's aspect ratio or cropping it to fit.
[15:51:40] <JayKaa> godbyk, and at which point do u read the .val() of the dropdown? i think u should do it after u received the response from the ajax request, so u better use a callback
[15:52:25] <JayKaa> godbyk, asynchronous is not the problem, but i think u use .val() before u receive the ajax response, and therefore before the second dropdown content has changed
[15:52:53] <godbyk> JayKaa: That makes sense.
[15:52:57] <Jax> hello
[15:53:46] <JayKaa> godbyk,  how i see this > on first dropdown change > u send an ajax request and set callback to handle the response > when the responses arrives u populate the second dropdown and then u read its .val()
[15:53:48] <Jax> is it legitimate to add own attributes to html for jquery?
[15:54:23] <Jax> like <select name="x"> <option value="y" myvar="uhuh">Hello</option> </select>
[15:54:47] <JayKaa> Jax, i often ask me the same question, not sure yet
[15:54:51] <AskMP> Jax: use the data attribute
[15:55:05] <AskMP> data-myVar=""
[15:55:09] <Jax> ah, thanks
[15:55:33] <godbyk> JayKaa: Here's the gist of the code I'm using at the moment: http://jsfiddle.net/GCRSj/
[15:55:37] <AskMP> jquery will be able to capture it by $('selector').data('myVar');
[15:55:42] <Jax> awesome
[15:56:36] <godbyk> JayKaa: If I understood you correctly, you think I should read the new dropdown2 selected item from within the success function and not outside of the $.ajax call, correct?
[15:57:31] <JayKaa> godbyk, yes i think it is the better choice
[15:57:55] <JayKaa> AskMP, didnt know about that, is it xhtml/html5 compliant ?
[15:57:57] <godbyk> JayKaa: I just tested it and it appears to be working well.  Thanks for your help!
[15:58:13] <JayKaa> godbyk, ure welcome :)
[15:58:17] <AskMP> it‚Äôs why it was created
[15:59:38] <Jax> how would i select the current selected option in a <select id="myselect"> ?
[15:59:40] <AskMP> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/global-attributes.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes
[16:00:00] <AskMP> that was for JayKaa
[16:01:28] <JayKaa> thx
[16:06:33] <JayKaa> Jax, $('#myselect').find('option[selected=selected]') ?
[16:06:44] <pacci> hi
[16:07:00] <pacci> !list
[16:11:23] <Posterdati> please I need help writing code with jquery to make an svg picture clickable
[16:20:07] <coldhead> More prices slashed!
[16:37:08] <ckoning> Is there any way to know which element the focus is going to during a blur or focusout event?
[17:24:18] <someprimetime> i'm trying to get the offset of an element relative to the window size, which offset() should do right? but it's giving me the offset relative to the parent container
[17:24:39] <someprimetime> how can i just find out out where a div is located relative to the window?
[17:27:52] <styol> someprimetime: var divoffset = $('element').offset().top - $(window).scrollTop(); or something like that
[17:28:47] <styol> but actually those values will change as you scroll yeah, so may need to use $(window).scroll(function(){});
[17:29:02] <someprimetime> styol: awesome thank you
[17:54:48] <martisj> Is there a way to check whether two events have been triggered?
[17:54:51] <martisj> at the same time?
[18:26:48] <SuperRoach> good morning all
[18:27:42] <Es0teric> hi SuperRoach
[18:30:36] <martisj> morning
[18:35:04] <donkeycongo> I .mouseout() supposed to be triggered when the mouse moves outside the actual element, but remains above a child-element?
[18:38:23] <donkeycongo> Worked with .mouseleave()
[18:58:06] <mustefaj> could someone take a look at this paste http://pastebin.com/EL0b5ed9
[18:58:33] <mustefaj> I'm having some confusion on defining the object and its arrays
[18:58:49] <mustefaj> So I think I've got a templates object
[18:58:58] <mustefaj> that has a list of objects inside of it
[18:59:09] <mustefaj> argumentation and informational in this case
[18:59:35] <mustefaj> and each of those has 3 objects inside of it
[18:59:46] <mustefaj> i'm getting confused on [] versus {}
[19:00:34] <mustefaj> maybe i'm missing an entire set of { } after analysis, comparisson etc
[19:01:38] <mustefaj> i think thats it :)
[19:01:39] <mustefaj> maybe
[19:02:50] <mustefaj> got it
[19:03:18] <mustefaj> http://pastebin.com/bB3BRG1f
[19:03:20] <mustefaj> something like that
[19:13:40] <mustefaj> why use arrays when everything can be treated as an object?
[19:14:07] <runvnc> Here is a platform I have been working on, let me know ifyou have any feedback or interest https://vimeo.com/43784316
[19:14:58] <mustefaj> @runvnc: let me know if you want a ux designer to work with on that
[19:15:47] <runvnc> mustefaj, if you would consider watching the video, or most of it, then I would really value any ideas your have
[19:15:55] <mustefaj> i'm watching it now
[19:16:07] <runvnc> or did you glance at it and instantly hate the way it looks and that is your comment
[19:16:17] <mustefaj> both man, both
[19:16:18] <mustefaj> lol
[19:16:23] <mustefaj> this is pretty awesome
[19:17:30] <runvnc> thanks
[19:20:21] <mustefaj> np. it has a whole lot of stuff going on that you can do
[19:23:27] <runvnc> ok such as?
[19:30:36] <trollboy> am I allowed to ask for support on jquery's fullcalendar plugin here, or is this the channel to ask?
[19:35:28] <sonnie> hi there. i want to know which jquery's event function has similar effect like onpropertychange ?  i tried keypress, it behaves strange
[19:38:17] <trollboy> sonnie, http://old.nabble.com/how-to-bind-onpropertychange-event-in-jquery--td7085408s27240.html
[19:39:10] <sonnie> is there another URL? i cannot access it :(
[19:39:47] <trollboy> behind some weird firewall?
[19:40:00] <trollboy> if you google jquery onpropertychange, you'll find tons of links
[19:40:15] <trollboy> I'm sure whatever search engine you use will provide the same
[19:40:19] <sonnie> ok.
[19:40:33] <trollboy> where are you geographically sonnie ?
[19:40:39] <Es0teric> has anyone here used the lastfm api?
[19:40:47] <trollboy> Es0teric, not I
[19:41:16] <tw2113> i have briefly
[19:41:43] <Es0teric> tw2113 ok.. well i am trying to detect whether a song is currently playing
[19:41:45] <trollboy> anyone here use full callendar?
[19:41:49] <sonnie> i'm in the Great FireWall
[19:42:03] <trollboy> Zhongguo?
[19:42:08] <tw2113> is there anything regarding it in the json output?
[19:42:14] <sonnie> hand trollboy
[19:42:14] <Es0teric> tw2113 yes
[19:42:20] <tw2113> then use that
[19:42:32] <Es0teric> its in the loop... its a @attr property
[19:43:11] <Es0teric> but... tw2113 i need to do val["@attr"].nowplaying === "true"
[19:43:14] <tw2113> can't figure out how to grab that in js?
[19:43:16] <Es0teric> but it doesnt work like that
[19:43:16] <trollboy> sonnie: http://jsfiddle.net/Nw4rA/
[19:43:42] <sonnie> thank you i just googled it
[19:43:53] <trollboy> bu ke qi sonnie
[19:44:22] <trollboy> you don't happen to know jquery fullcalendar do you sonnie ?
[19:45:11] <tw2113> have you tried .attr() ?
[19:45:28] <Es0teric> tw2113 no.. not the method
[19:45:34] <Es0teric> tw2113 theres a actual property
[19:47:01] <tw2113> i know what part you're talking about
[19:47:38] <tw2113> in my time of use, i've run into the #text part of last.fm returned data
[19:47:48] <tw2113> and had to find a way to get through it, however mine was done with php
[19:49:53] <tw2113> @attr": { "nowplaying": "true" } right?
[19:50:18] <Es0teric> tw2113 yes
[19:50:46] <tw2113> a fiddle would be awesome
[19:50:54] <tw2113> you can even leave the api key part blank and i'll put in my own
[19:53:38] <Es0teric> tw2113 yeah, i'll put up a fiddle real quick
[19:56:37] <Es0teric> tw2113 http://jsfiddle.net/e24dS/1/show/
[20:07:22] <tw2113> got it
[20:07:38] <Es0teric> tw2113 cool
[20:07:51] <tw2113> wanna know what the issue is with your original fiddle?
[20:08:27] <Es0teric> tw2113 well i knew what it was
[20:08:28] <Es0teric> lol
[20:08:29] <tw2113> the attempt to retrieve the @attr stuff, is in the wrong .each()
[20:08:37] <Es0teric> wait what?
[20:08:38] <Es0teric> o.O
[20:08:46] <tw2113> it's not in the track array
[20:08:48] <tw2113> it's below it
[20:09:01] <Es0teric> tw2113 so i have to make another $.each()?
[20:09:06] <tw2113> nope
[20:09:34] <Es0teric> tw2113 when theres a currently playing song
[20:09:43] <Es0teric> the 0 id will have the @attr
[20:11:42] <tw2113> managed to get "NP: [object Object]"
[20:12:00] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/e24dS/2/
[20:12:53] <tw2113> so you'll want something like np = val["@attr"].totalPages;
[20:13:55] <Es0teric> no, tw2113
[20:14:07] <Es0teric> the only property in @attr is "nowplaying"
[20:14:08] <Es0teric> thats it
[20:14:11] <Es0teric> thats all im looking for
[20:14:26] <tw2113> then do np = val["@attr"].nowplaying;
[20:14:32] <tw2113> and you'll get the value
[20:14:39] <Es0teric> no, tw2113 it shows up as "undefined"
[20:14:43] <Es0teric> i already tried that
[20:14:50] <tw2113> in YOUR version
[20:14:57] <Es0teric> i tried it in yours too
[20:15:46] <tw2113> eh, i'm part wrong
[20:18:02] <tw2113> looks like maybe a scope issue
[20:18:40] <Jakx> hi
[20:20:36] <Es0teric> tw2113 yeah... i figured i just dont know which scope
[20:26:14] <tw2113> i give up at the moment, sorry :D
[20:26:26] <tw2113> i tried
[20:28:24] <Es0teric> lol its alright, tw2113
[20:28:31] <Es0teric> i actually gave up on it too lol
[20:30:21] <Es0teric> tw2113 how would you deal with the duplicate track names though?
[20:31:12] <tw2113> not sure
[20:31:24] <tw2113> i put in my own feed data and wasn't seeing duplicates
[20:32:08] <Es0teric> tw2113 i see... well if you put in my username then you'll see theres duplicates
[20:52:14] <Whirl3d> Good evenin all. In setting up the initialization function for my "gallery" script, I want to store the default animation properties in the gallery object. The problem is that I need to resolve a deferred in the complete callback that doesn't exist at the time I need to setup these properties...is there any way to handle it?
[20:55:19] <tw2113> what a helpful error "TypeError: a is undefined"
[21:02:25] <tga> hey, any idea how I can get the browser to stop caching ajax-loaded pages?
[21:02:56] <tga> in a jqmobile app I load all my pages from individual files and I need to hit the raw page to get it to refresh
[21:12:40] <sgo11> Hi, I never really study javascript in detail. can anyone suggest me some good online tutorial/books that I can learn javascript/ajax before I can use jquery? thanks a lot.
[21:12:55] <systemfault> !eloquent
[21:13:06] <systemfault> Err wrong channel :/
[21:13:17] <systemfault> Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[21:13:18] <systemfault> :P
[21:13:26] <systemfault> sgo11: Start with that :D
[21:14:02] <sgo11> systemfault, thanks a lot for the link. :)
[21:15:11] <sgo11> systemfault, which javascript interpreter that people normally use for debug in linux? thanks.
[21:15:11] <Joshibros> Hello friends
[21:15:44] <systemfault> sgo11: They use the javascript console of their favorite browser
[21:16:02] <systemfault> sgo11: In my personal case, it's the Chrome Dev Tools
[21:16:37] <sgo11> systemfault, yeah, I am using chrome as well. but never use the dev tools. are they built-in?
[21:16:58] <systemfault> sgo11: Yeah ctrl+shift+J IIRC
[21:17:12] <sgo11> systemfault, got it. thanks a lot for your kind help.

[21:18:38] <Es0teric> i have multiple items in a array.. how do i remove duplicates?
[21:19:12] <tga> I need a sanity check
[21:19:16] <systemfault> Es0teric: An array of what?
[21:19:20] <shawn> tga: check.
[21:19:20] <tga> pipe can be used to chain deferreds, right?
[21:19:31] <systemfault> tga: Yeah
[21:19:43] <Es0teric> systemfault array of... objects
[21:20:03] <systemfault> Es0teric: do these objects have an id?
[21:20:14] <Es0teric> systemfault well actually i have an array of objects but i want to remove duplicate properties
[21:20:39] <tga> self.loadPages().done(function() { console.log('wtf'); }).pipe(self.authenticate())
[21:20:56] <tga> my console output is like 'loading pages‚Ä¶ authenticating‚Ä¶ wtf'
[21:21:02] <systemfault> tga: pipe happens before the done
[21:21:05] <systemfault> usually :/
[21:21:08] <systemfault> I might be wrong.
[21:21:11] <tga> oh
[21:21:27] <Es0teric> systemfault http://jsfiddle.net/e24dS/4/ <--
[21:21:39] <Es0teric> so as you can see, theres duplicate items
[21:22:18] <tga> systemfault: still weird though, when I resolve the loadPages() deferred I log a message to the console
[21:22:27] <tga> systemfault: that message shows up _after_ authenticate()
[21:22:44] <tga> afaict, the function in pipe() executes _before_ the first one is resolved
[21:23:15] <tga> aw nm
[21:23:26] <Joshibros> i want to learn to use youtube chromeless player, i found this code [http://jsfiddle.net/sz4FF/1/]  ..... but when i use it on when load it from local computer it's not working.... and also i think there is some problem with VIDEO SCRUB controller .... can anyone please help
[21:23:40] <tga> pipe(self.authenticate()) <-- too many brackets, I was executing the function instead of passing it
[21:24:00] <tga> this explains a million problems
[21:24:45] <shawn> a million problems? whoah.
[21:24:53] <systemfault> tga: Ahh :D
[21:25:10] <tga> timing issues, sometimes everything would just go wrong
[21:25:14] <tga> yay async
[21:26:00] <Joshibros> someone please at least guide me in right direction PLEASE
[21:26:24] <shawn> Es0teric: just use underscore uniq()?
[21:26:25] <tga> <--- that way
[21:26:32] <Jakx> tga, lol
[21:27:58] <Es0teric> shawn what?
[21:28:34] <shawn> Es0teric: you should be able to use underscorejs to filter your duplicates out
[21:29:14] <shawn> Es0teric: maybe jquery has something similar, but I consider underscore to be a library that should have been just bundled in javascript the language
[21:29:27] <shawn> http://underscorejs.org/
[21:29:37] <Es0teric> shawn, well jquery has unique()
[21:30:38] <shawn> Es0teric: jQuery.unique is a nice toy, underscore is the real deal.
[21:31:14] <Joshibros> $('Please').show('me some light');
[21:31:55] <shawn> Es0teric: according to the jquery docs, it wants an array of DOM elements, which isn't your intent, right?
[21:32:34] <shawn> Es0teric: anyway, underscore is a more industrial strength collections utility - I strongly recommend it as your problem would be solved with a single line of code (roughly)
[21:32:34] <Es0teric> shawn, well... its this right here -> http://jsfiddle.net/e24dS/4/
[21:36:32] <Es0teric> shawn, did you see the fiddle?
[21:36:44] <shawn> umm, let me take a look
[21:39:04] <Es0teric> shawn alright
[21:43:03] <mansuk>  div1.css({"left":rect.left,"top":rect.top,'border-top':"1px solid blue", 'width':rect.width}); ... Is there something wrong with is statement? I am trying to apply a border for a div, but the border doesn't show up...
[21:51:18] <Whirl3d> can I bind a function to an element so that it it is "animated", it fires?
[21:51:36] <Whirl3d> is there an animation event?
[21:54:35] <box> hi
[21:55:13] <rags> can a callback be added to elements with the same id ?
[21:56:16] <Whirl3d> rags, two elements can't have the same id
[21:56:34] <shawn> Es0teric: ok, it's gonna take more than one line
[21:57:02] <Es0teric> thats fine, shawn.. i just need to figure out how to do it
[21:57:02] <Es0teric> lo
[21:57:04] <Es0teric> l
[21:57:27] <rags> Whirl3d, hmm, ok, can a callback be added to a css class then? I have a list of links which should perform the same action when clicked on.
[21:57:45] <Whirl3d> yes.
[21:57:55] <rags> Whirl3d, thx!
[21:57:59] <Whirl3d> but it's often better in that case to find a common parent element and use .on
[21:58:35] <Whirl3d> then you have one function handling the callbacks for all your x class elements, for example.
[21:58:52] <rags> oh, didn't know about .on, will read about it
[21:59:13] <box> how do i replace the text of the body tag?
[21:59:19] <Whirl3d> .on is the new preferred way to handle event delegation...
[21:59:27] <mansuk> div1.css({"left":rect.left,"top":rect.top,'border-top':"1px solid blue", 'width':rect.width}); ... Is there something wrong with is statement? I am trying to apply a border for a div, but the border doesn't show up..
[21:59:29] <Whirl3d> $("body").text("text");
[21:59:56] <Whirl3d> mansuk, if you want help, go to jsfiddle.net and setup a test case. then post the link back here.
[22:00:18] <Whirl3d> }
[22:08:22] <mansuk> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/dHwUf/
[22:09:01] <mansuk> mansuk: http://jsfiddle.net/dHwUf/ hi all, can some one tell me why the border doesn't show up in the code in the link above. It's just a 2 line program. Thanks!
[22:12:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHwUf/4/
[22:12:55] <Whirl3d> not the exact same thing, but it works.
[22:13:16] <Whirl3d> first: live has been deprecated
[22:14:28] <Whirl3d> I'm no expert at css, but I have never see a border applied like you did...not saying it's wrong, just never seen it
[22:15:30] <Whirl3d> I see wher eyou get the rectangle (though I have never see getBoudingClientRect();
[22:15:51] <Whirl3d> but then you create a div (not attached to the dom) and apply a border to it
[22:16:09] <Whirl3d> it's never added to the dom, so there's no way to know if it worked
[22:16:45] <Whirl3d> you could say div1.appendTo("body"); and it would append the div to the dom and it might have your border....
[22:17:15] <Whirl3d> What are you trying to accomplish?
[22:20:38] <ENQ> good morning
[22:21:33] <Whirl3d> Mornin'
[22:21:42] <ENQ> im trying to make a plugin, where should i declare options witch should be used from all instances of plugin? like config or smth like that, and i could access it like $.plugin('config', {}) or so
[22:22:00] <ENQ> im using jquery plugin authoring article as reference
[22:23:32] <trollboy> so I'm using the full_calendar plugin, and I'm trying to load it 100% programmatically but its only loading events on google chrome, not in FF or Safari
[22:23:43] <trollboy> no errors on FF
[22:25:04] <Whirl3d> ENQ, that's a hard one to articluate. You'd create a closure that would encapsulate your shared variables outside the literal plugin def.
[22:26:33] <Whirl3d> trollboy, you'll need to create a test case on jsfiddle for help
[22:26:40] <mansuk> Whirl3d: may be I am not appending to DOm
[22:26:51] <Whirl3d> you aren't
[22:26:52] <mansuk> I am trying to create a prototype DOM inspector
[22:26:55] <ENQ> like $fn.plugin.config? and put it there?
[22:27:03] <mansuk> Whirl3d: let me try that...
[22:27:17] <trollboy> Whirl3d, can I link you to the application?
[22:27:53] <Whirl3d> ENQ, that's the plugin's namespace...more likethis (function ($) { var shared=50; $.plugin=function () .....})(jQuery);
[22:28:09] <ENQ> oh, got it thanks
[22:28:39] <mansuk> damn that was dumb..
[22:28:41] <Whirl3d> and you get the difference between $.fn.plugin and $.plugin, right?
[22:29:19] <Whirl3d> mansuk, that's an interesting coding style that I have never seen before. What is your main coding language?
[22:29:32] <coder2> can i append some dynamic data in a list, as a link?
[22:29:40] <Whirl3d> yes
[22:30:13] <coder2> show me some way
[22:30:14] <ENQ> Whirl3d, i noticed that there is no fn in that function, its probably so that i could call $.plugin('config', {})
[22:30:16] <trollboy> that yes to me Whirl3d?
[22:30:49] <Whirl3d> sure trollboy...no guarantees here I've never used the plugin in quesiton.
[22:31:02] <trollboy> noticing you now
[22:32:03] <Whirl3d> ENQ, my understanding is that $.fn.plugin ()    should try to always return a jquery object. So that it's chaninable. Furthermore inside $.fn.plugin's definitio, "this" is the jquery object that is calling the plugin..
[22:32:22] <Whirl3d> with $.plugin, the first param is often the target of the plugin
[22:33:09] <coder2>  can i append some dynamic data in a list, as a link?
[22:33:18] <tmerrill99s> jquery 1.4.4:  How does one change the 'selected' attribute to 'selected' in a drop down?  This should be extremely easy.  Apparently (in 1.4.4), it's not.
[22:33:19] <Whirl3d> so, I have seen it done a lot where someone will write $.fn.plugin=function () {  return this.each(function () {$.plugin($(this),arguments)});
[22:33:19] <tmerrill99s> http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/41/
[22:34:20] <tmerrill99s> my fiddle works in 1.6.x
[22:34:34] <lotus> hey
[22:34:40] <lotus> how does jquery get elements by attribute?
[22:34:43] <tmerrill99s> everything BUT adding the 'selected' attribute to the option does though.
[22:34:46] <ENQ> ill try to check for an article about this :) and use case, got idea of what to look
[22:34:49] <lotus> i.e. how does the attribute selector work?  I can't find it in the core
[22:35:06] <trollboy> Whirl3d, you see anything?
[22:35:07] <tmerrill99s> LotR, attr('theOneImLookingFor')
[22:35:21] <Whirl3d> ENQ, one minute I have a good link for you...
[22:35:24] <tmerrill99s> crap....lotus
[22:35:30] <ENQ> thanks man
[22:35:35] <Whirl3d> http://bitovi.com/blog/2010/10/writing-the-perfect-jquery-plugin.html
[22:35:44] <lotus> tmerrill99s, nono, I mean... how does it work in the core?  ;)
[22:35:45] <Es0teric> how do i remove duplicate items?
[22:35:48] <Whirl3d> it's one guys opinion, but it's pretty thorough
[22:35:55] <tmerrill99s> oh.....not too sure.  sorry
[22:36:20] <Whirl3d> trollboy I never saw a link
[22:36:33] <trollboy> ah I noticed it to you
[22:36:33] <Whirl3d> sorry. I see it now
[22:38:05] <tmerrill99s> dudes.  i have the quiz of the century here.....http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/41/
[22:38:20] <tmerrill99s> my hair is starting to come out in clumps!
[22:38:38] <tmerrill99s> maybe (just maybe) I've found a bug in 1.4.4???
[22:38:38] <trollboy> tmerrill99s, radium is not a toy
[22:38:42] <Whirl3d> trollboy, I am afraid I have no idea where the problem is. I see it's not working in FF, but no idea why?
[22:38:49] <trollboy> likewise
[22:38:52] <trollboy> no errors either
[22:38:52] <tmerrill99s> trollboy, that's what they WANT you to believe.  ;-)
[22:39:29] <Whirl3d> tmerrill99s, what is it not doing?
[22:39:49] <tmerrill99s> it's doing everything BUT putting the 'selected' attribute on the option in the drop down.
[22:39:57] <tmerrill99s> it happens in 1.6.x, Whirl3d .
[22:40:03] <tmerrill99s> just not in 1.4.4.
[22:40:18] <tmerrill99s> so the question is, what dance must one do to make it happen in 1.4.4?
[22:40:32] <tmerrill99s> inquiring minds, etc..........
[22:41:10] <Whirl3d> I'm still not getting you. break it down real slow and simple for me. I'm not too bright. What do you expect to see in the console that you aren't seeing?
[22:41:56] <tmerrill99s> Whirl3d, if you inspect the dropdown in firebug and click on a picture, the 'selected' attribute will NOT get set on the correct option (in fact, it doesn't get set at all).
[22:42:15] <tmerrill99s> i mean 'inspect an option within the dropdown'
[22:42:28] <tmerrill99s> the dropdown is under the pictures (just in case you couldn't see it)
[22:43:08] <Whirl3d> try attr('selected','selected')?
[22:43:29] <tmerrill99s> Whirl3d, change the version to the 1.6.(whatever) and it'll work.
[22:43:50] <tmerrill99s> like i said.....hair.....clumps.
[22:44:12] <tmerrill99s> console log looks great, however.
[22:44:31] <tmerrill99s> tried it.
[22:44:34] <tmerrill99s> didn't work.
[22:45:03] <Whirl3d> don't use 1.4
[22:45:09] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:45:19] <tmerrill99s> unfortunately, i'm stuck
[22:45:29] <Whirl3d> did you look in the bug logs?
[22:45:38] <tmerrill99s> no.
[22:45:52] <tmerrill99s> is there one place to go for that?
[22:45:57] <tmerrill99s> or should i just google search it.
[22:46:13] <Whirl3d> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7889
[22:46:17] <Whirl3d> first google result
[22:53:04] <ENQ> i read the article, and my pattern is similar, but there is nothing about plugin settigns
[22:53:45] <Whirl3d> how do you mean, like defaults?
[22:53:54] <ENQ> like $.ajax
[22:54:19] <ENQ> has some predefined configs, witch applie to every subsequent calls
[22:54:42] <Whirl3d> that's prototyping isn't it.
[22:54:54] <ENQ> might be
[22:54:55] <ENQ> idk
[22:55:19] <Whirl3d> protoypical inheritance means that it will share those methods/variables with all instances of the plugin
[22:55:42] <ENQ> would be good to share methods
[22:55:49] <coder2> can i dynamically append links in list of links?that is i want to append links from my database,is it possible? then how?
[22:56:26] <Whirl3d> often you'll see someone do var plugin=new PluginFunc(opts)   then they'll do $.extend(plugin.protoptype, {bunch of methods});
[22:57:11] <Whirl3d> coder2, setup a test case in jsfiddle and i'tll be a lot easier to anser your question. There are a million ways...it depends on your implementation
[22:57:37] <ENQ> found it, its ajaxSetup()
[22:58:03] <Whirl3d> lol I thought you were talking abstractly, not specifically about ajax. LOL
[22:58:11] <ENQ> its example
[22:58:13] <ENQ> :)
[22:58:37] <ENQ> would be good to do prototype somehow, too google!
[22:59:22] <coder2> Whirl3d, i have a variable in which data from database is retrived each time, i just have to put that in a href of <a href></a>, so is it possible?
[22:59:43] <Whirl3d> coder2, setup a test case in jsfiddle and i'tll be a lot easier to anser your question. There are a million ways...it depends on your implementation
[23:00:03] <Whirl3d> how is the data retrieved.
[23:00:11] <Whirl3d> how is it presented.
[23:00:15] <Whirl3d> is it JSON format
[23:00:50] <Whirl3d> is this something that is going to require a regular expression and no jquery? is it just javasccript String methods that you need.
[23:01:14] <Whirl3d> without a concrete example (prefereably in jsfiddle), it's all gonna be conjecture.
[23:01:58] <coder2> Whirl3d, its not json, i call a fuction and it returns the data in variable myContact.number ,just tell me can we insert html code like <a> in append function?
[23:06:17] <Whirl3d> you can
[23:06:22] <Whirl3d> why not jsut try it?
[23:07:13] <coder2> okay
[23:13:41] <ENQ> Whirl3d, is this a good read
[23:13:42] <ENQ> http://alexsexton.com/blog/2010/02/using-inheritance-patterns-to-organize-large-jquery-applications/
[23:18:29] <snover> by the time you‚Äôre thinking about patterns to structure large apps you probably should be using a toolkit like dojo which defines well-tested patterns that are designed to make it easy to perform large app development instead
[23:20:21] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I try not to should all over myself...it's okay if others should all over me--you get used to it.
[23:20:54] <ENQ> i prefer jquery tho
[23:21:15] <snover> ENQ: that statement is meaningless. it is like talking about types of meat and saying ‚Äúi prefer oranges‚Äù
[23:21:26] <snover> oranges are not a meat. jquery is not an application development toolkit.
[23:22:00] <ENQ> sorry for my missleading link, was reading it to better understand inheritence
[23:22:17] <mawhtin> anyone here like jqtouch?
[23:24:49] <coder2> Whirl3d, succeeded :)
[23:26:11] <Whirl3d> told ya it was easy!
[23:26:22] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:26:37] <coder2> Whirl3d, :) :P
[23:33:44] <billy_> hi
[23:34:14] <billy_> is there any way to find the control through mouse position
[23:36:01] <Cork> billy_: hover?
[23:36:52] <billy_> cork :yes
[23:37:26] <Cork> i meant bind a mousemove/hover/mouseenter event on the element and it will be triggered when the mouse moved over it
[23:57:02] <billy_> cork: thnx
