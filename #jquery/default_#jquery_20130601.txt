[00:05:02] <SeanJM> beboo: this doesn't work locally?
[00:05:23] <SeanJM> beboo: The ID is returning a unique element and that element is on the page--only the event binding is off
[00:05:34] <beboo> SeanJM, using a private server atm. Should I test locally?
[00:05:38] <SeanJM> beboo: it's possible that you'll need to attach to a jQuery UI method
[00:06:15] <beboo> Why is this giving me problems? Haven't had issues with this before.
[00:06:27] <SeanJM> beboo: I honnestly don't know, :-/
[00:06:44] <beboo> I tried setting the value to make sure I had the right element and it's not working either.
[00:07:27] <SeanJM> beboo: http://jsfiddle.net/qJXzg/ <--- here is my little fork and I log the actual element When you hover over the element in the console, it doesn't highlight that text input there
[00:08:16] <ankush> SeanJM: can you please help me with my query
[00:08:56] <SeanJM> beboo: turning off jQueryUI fixes the problem
[00:09:03] <beboo> SeanJM, yeah, not sure what is going on. It's not like the id is changing or anything.
[00:09:18] <beboo> Hrm, interesting. So it's UI doing it.
[00:09:27] <SeanJM> beboo: so it's probably being detached and reattached at some point destroying the event listener
[00:09:37] <unnu> im addicted to this tiberium alliances game
[00:09:38] <beboo> Ok, i'll have to see if there is something I need to do for that. Thanks.
[00:09:56] <SeanJM> ankush: sure, what's the issue?
[00:11:57] <ankush> My form submits to an iframe, I need to knw when the form submit occured, so that I can take the result and do something with it. How can I do that?
[00:13:08] <horrror> i need a simple way to create a simple modal/overlay popup on click. any suggestions?
[00:13:22] <ankush> I basically used http://pastebin.com/Wkix1xh6, but couldnt understand
[00:14:53] <beboo> SeanJM, for future, need to use $(document).on('pageinit') not .ready for jquery mobile :)
[00:14:57] <beboo> Working great.
[00:16:22] <SeanJM> beboo: awesome
[00:17:34] <SeanJM> ankush: you can monitor changes on the iframe--so when it's 'src' attribute changes you can check to see if it's pointing to the address where the form is submitted
[00:21:54] <ankush> SeanJM: but, in my iframe there is no src attrib
[00:22:02] <SeanJM> ankush: and I just tested that idea, and it wont work
[00:22:05] <Rinthe> I have <div class="post' data-href="url"><div class="overlayhidden"><div class="postmeta"></div></div> content</div> I'm using javascript to push the url when .post is clicked. Right now I want to make it so that .postmeta is clicked, it wouldn't go to the link. anyone know how i can do this?
[00:22:52] <ankush> if I can just understand  how this works, http://pastebin.com/Wkix1xh6 .
[00:23:02] <tw2113> $('.postmeta').on('click',function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[00:23:23] <SeanJM> ankush: well--there is probably a better way to do this however, when your button is pressed and it submits to an iframe Is there an element on that iframe page that is unique? You could set a timer to check for that element, when it's there--run your function and clearInterval on the timer
[00:27:29] <SeanJM> ankush: Go line by line slowly on that--take your time I'm off to bed Good luck
[00:52:32] <Abhijit> how can i get the data if a single json obj when i know the obj id ?
[00:52:38] <Abhijit> of*
[00:58:15] <Rinthe> I have <div class="post' data-href="url"><div class="overlayhidden"><div class="postmeta"></div></div> content</div> I'm using javascript to push the url when .post is clicked. Right now I want to make it so that .postmeta is clicked, it wouldn't go to the link. anyone know how i can do this?
[01:00:52] <brendal> Rinthe, with ajax?
[01:01:17] <Rinthe> brendal: huh? how?
[01:01:34] <Rinthe> the postmeta is positioned relative to the very top of overlay
[01:01:45] <Rinthe> but its still inside the overlay
[01:02:06] <meowcat> JSON is so cool
[01:02:13] <meowcat> wifacebook's graph API
[01:02:21] <meowcat> with*
[01:03:46] <brendal> Rinthe: what exactly are you trying to submit?
[01:04:07] <Rinthe> brendal: im not trying to submit anything
[01:04:21] <Rinthe> brendal: right now when i click the .overlay, it'll go to that link, thats fine
[01:04:32] <Rinthe> but i want to make it so that when i click on .postmeta, it doesnt go to that link
[01:04:44] <Rinthe> i want it to do nothing
[01:04:47] <Rinthe> if its possible
[01:06:16] <brendal> Rinthe: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[01:06:41] <brendal> Rinthe: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ I mean
[01:06:42] <Rinthe> hmm i dont see how that could help me
[01:07:06] <Rinthe> dont htink that'll help either
[01:08:24] <brendal> Rinthe, then you'll have to show me more code so I understand what you're doing.
[01:08:59] <Rinthe> brendal: mind if i PM you a link?
[01:09:08] <brendal> Rinthe: that's fine
[01:23:15] <Abhijit> how can i get the data of a single json obj when i know the obj id ?
[01:25:50] <sacho> Abhijit,
[01:25:51] <sacho> <ecmabot> JSON object is an often misused buzzword that does not have a well-defined meaning. See https://github.com/killdream/screw-the-buzzwords/wiki/JSON for alternatives to express what you mean.
[01:26:53] <brendal> Abhijit, what do you mean obj id? from where?
[01:35:46] <Abhijit> brendal, i have data in json file. it is array. each single array element has data a:1 or a:2 or a:3 . Now i read this json array in jq. now i create css div of height 1, 2 or3 depending on value of "a". hence each single json array has its own css dive. now in loop through all this divs checking if any of thew overlaps with another div called "targetdiv". now if it does overlap THEN I want to know which json array this currend css div corresponds
[01:35:46] <Abhijit> to?
[01:35:52] <Abhijit> do you got it? brendal
[01:36:00] <Abhijit> sacho, ^
[01:36:42] <sacho> Okay, but what's the problem in doing that?
[01:37:09] <Abhijit> sacho, "how" do i find which json array element the currend div corresponds to?
[01:37:25] <sacho> well, mark your divs somehow.
[01:37:31] <Abhijit> "how"
[01:38:16] <brendal> Abhijit: When you create the div set the div's id to the index of the array
[01:38:22] <sacho> You could use a data-* property. Or an id, with a prefix if you're worried about collisions. Or a class. Or you could check the height(since it's what you mentioned was in the data).
[01:38:48] <brendal> Abhijit: something like "mydiv-37"
[01:39:25] <Abhijit> brendal, when i tried to do that i end up getting more than one representation for each div. that mean there are multiple divs of same div
[01:39:44] <Abhijit> sacho, ok
[01:40:18] <sacho> It's a really broad question - pick one way, and if there's a problem working it in, ask a question about it
[01:40:28] <Abhijit> ok
[01:40:45] <javalover> well sql is kinda dead right now so i figured i'd ask you lovely coders
[01:40:46] <brendal> Abhijit, I didn't mean set the id to the value. I meant the index of the list.
[01:41:15] <javalover> I have a simple pm system setup that i'm using, but the person who set it up uses ID as in the index ID  as the key for communicating user to user
[01:41:30] <javalover> my question is, my thought is you use more of a unique ID to track the messages, is this a good idea or a bad one?
[01:41:53] <javalover> and further more, shouldn't I be encrypting the messages...kinda messed up if I can just read anything anyone writes....
[01:42:00] <Abhijit> brendal, whats the diffrence?
[01:43:00] <brendal> Abhijit, if you do for(i=0;i<length;i++) set the id to i.
[01:43:13] <Abhijit> ok
[01:43:19] <Abhijit> got it
[01:47:13] <brendal> javalover: you're messages should have a unique id if you're storing them. whether you should use encryption or not depends on what it's use is.
[01:56:19] <Abhijit> brendal, and now i have id in hand as 2 then how can i access the 2nd array elemend from json?
[01:57:38] <brendal> my_array[1]
[01:57:54] <brendal> Abhijit, array indexes start at 0
[02:00:47] <Abhijit> brendal, my array is this http://paste.opensuse.org/98331950 it do not work if i do $.getJSON('json/eventData.json', function(json) {alert(json[indx]);});
[02:01:51] <brendal> Abhijit, you have to parse it first to turn it into an array with eval(json); there are no such things as json objects. they're just strings.
[02:02:09] <Abhijit> ok
[02:11:06] <cha> hello
[02:11:16] <boytoy> hi
[02:11:55] <boytoy> i was wondering -- what do u guys think of this "Back to top" scroll approach? http://jsfiddle.net/mnQb6/
[02:12:03] <boytoy> (got it off stackoverflow)
[02:21:36] <cha> suppose I have a looped div
[02:21:41] <cha> having the same classname
[02:29:25] <cha> how will I handle scroll to bottom automatically in an overflowing class
[02:35:32] <meowcat> is JSONP a hack for ajax?
[02:35:53] <meowcat> to allow cross domain requests, or is it entirely its own thing?
[02:39:20] <brendal> it's not ajax because you cant do it dynamically
[02:41:10] <brendal> meowcat: actually I guess you can, but it's still not ajax
[02:42:00] <meowcat> ajax uses it as a dataType JSONP but ajax is limited by SOP
[02:42:51] <brendal> I think you can only use it if the server is set up for it
[02:44:10] <meowcat> its not about the server though its about the clien as it happens client side.
[02:44:27] <meowcat> client*
[02:45:18] <brendal> yes, but you cant use the data if it's just json being executed
[02:48:43] <meowcat> i object your reality and substitute my own
[02:51:24] <brendal> meowcat, if you can write a funtion that arbitrarily substitutes realities then fine.

[08:41:51] <BillCriswell> not_mike: div:hover img { display: block; }
[08:43:52] <BillCriswell> not_mike: It seems like you're making this very complicated, but I'm also not sure I understand the big picture.
[08:44:29] <not_mike> div:hover img { display: block; } did not work
[08:45:02] <LEU> can anybody help me ?
[08:45:12] <LEU>  http://jsfiddle.net/UgJfE/1/ this is my code i try to make divs to spam in the same place tell me how if you can
[08:46:44] <not_mike> (@billcriswell)
[08:47:11] <BillCriswell> not_mike: Is this what you're trying to accomplish? http://jsbin.com/eqonaz/1/edit
[08:48:10] <not_mike> yes. I can get it to work without javascript. however I am trying to do the same on my website, which creates divs/elements with js.
[08:48:24] <not_mike> that's why i did it like that on jsfiddle.
[08:50:07] <BillCriswell> not_mike: Do div:hover img { visiblity: visible !important; }
[08:50:39] <BillCriswell> SHould remove all that styling going on in the script and move it to CSS so you can avoid things like !important in this situation.
[08:50:55] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/958/ Damn dude.. 958?
[08:51:15] <not_mike> Yea idk.
[08:51:19] <not_mike> thanks bro!
[08:51:22] <BillCriswell> Oops, sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/959/
[08:51:26] <BillCriswell> Forgot the >.
[08:51:42] <not_mike> exactly what i wanted man
[08:51:45] <not_mike> thanks so much
[08:52:02] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:52:13] <Rinthe> say i got all the contents of a new page, how do i find only the <div class="post"></div>'s ?
[08:52:34] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: Just .post
[08:52:52] <Rinthe> billcriswell: no i mean to parse it out
[08:53:31] <Rinthe> using $.get('url', function() { }
[08:53:31] <not_mike> and it works on my site. I spent like 8 hours yesterday trying to figure out why it wouldn't work
[08:53:38] <not_mike> thanks again, BillCriswell
[08:54:01] <BillCriswell> not_mike: Overriding inline styles can be a pain.
[08:54:10] <Rinthe> billcriswell: this is for endless scrolling, i got al the contents of the new page, now i need to only take whats needed
[08:54:53] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: If you just want .post you'd do $('.post'). I feel like I may be missing something.
[08:56:04] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: I'm not trying to select on the current page: http://pastebin.com/PV6JJbnf
[08:56:24] <Rinthe> i could do data.html(.post
[08:56:29] <Rinthe> but that'll only get me the first one right
[08:56:45] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: If data is HTML you can do $(data).find('.post');
[08:57:01] <BillCriswell> Which would return an array of posts.
[08:58:10] <RK> Hi guys, we're reinventing the wheel. Can you help us out (check the link) ? Cheers : http://goo.gl/zLgfD
[08:59:15] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: var foo = data.find($('.post'));
[08:59:15] <Rinthe> console.log(foo);
[08:59:37] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: What?
[08:59:40] <Rinthe> getting error: Uncaught TypeError: Object <!DOCTYPE html>
[09:00:20] <BillCriswell> Are you doing data = $(data); before hang?
[09:00:24] <Rinthe> billbriswell: and the all of the html is displayed in the error, what does that mean
[09:00:25] <BillCriswell> before hand*
[09:00:33] <Rinthe> no, what does that do?
[09:00:51] <BillCriswell> jQueryizeseseses it.
[09:00:57] <Rinthe> lol let me try
[09:01:49] <BillCriswell> var $posts = $(data).find('.post'); $container.append($posts); or something along those lines.
[09:02:24] <Rinthe> i did that, now console returns some stuff i dont understand
[09:02:30] <Rinthe> billCriswell: but its not an error haha
[09:02:42] <Rinthe> billcriswell: [prevObject: x.fn.x.init[158], context: undefined, jquery: "2.0.0", constructor: function, init: function…]...
[09:02:46] <Rinthe> does that sound right?
[09:04:31] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: im trying to use https://github.com/fredwu/jquery-endless-scroll with the html i got, do you know where I pass the html to?
[09:06:52] <BillCriswell> I'll actually brb.
[09:08:37] <screamingbanshee> @Rinthe - you append the returned html - the new divs to add - to the bottom of wherever your main content displays, like $("#content").append(loadedDivs)
[09:09:09] <Rinthe> screamingbanshee: Im trying to use that endless scroll tho, would that do the appending?
[09:09:24] <screamingbanshee> hold on I am looking at it now
[09:11:13] <Rinthe> screamingbanshee: i think it does, because I would do $('#index').endlessScroll({
[09:13:00] <screamingbanshee> ok
[09:13:01] <screamingbanshee> I see
[09:13:07] <Rinthe> i did var $posts = $(data).find($('.post')); im not sure if the data is correct, when i do console log
[09:13:10] <Rinthe> it shows some function
[09:13:10] <not_mike> why doesn't the image in hoverq.innerHTML show whenever I add a link? (it works without the a href) -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/960/
[09:13:28] <Rinthe> is there a way to check?
[09:13:39] <screamingbanshee> ok - I need to know more to tell you what to check, lol
[09:14:25] <screamingbanshee> let me see where these load from
[09:15:21] <Rinthe> screamingbanshee: ill pm you is that ok?
[09:15:48] <screamingbanshee> ok
[09:15:52] <toumiax2> is it possible to serialize a dynamically loaded html-form? I just can't get it to work.
[09:16:08] <screamingbanshee> toumiax2 - yes
[09:16:10] <toumiax2> I use $.append('<form .... )
[09:16:20] <toumiax2> in an click-eventhandler
[09:16:21] <toumiax2> to add the form
[09:16:52] <toumiax2> is it not added to the DOM this way? are there any "common" mistakes when trynig to do something like this?

[09:22:35] <FrameFever> I have an object literal with keys and values
[09:22:59] <dabear> FrameFever: wow!
[09:23:02] <FrameFever> when I know iterate through it with $.each(function(key,value).. I get not the same order like it is shown in firebug
[09:23:09] <dabear> :p
[09:23:22] <FrameFever> -know + now
[09:28:10] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: http://jsbin.com/acimew/1/ is a quick demo.
[09:28:43] <BillCriswell> If the posts aren't wrapped with a container you'll probably have to use .filter().
[09:29:04] <FrameFever> what am I doing wrong?
[09:29:04] <FrameFever> http://jsfiddle.net/5AEYk/
[09:29:10] <FrameFever> I don't get any console.log output
[09:29:28] <BillCriswell> For instance with that example .find('.foo') won't work since it's a direct child of <body>, but .filter('.foo') will.
[09:30:50] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: What happens if you refresh?
[09:30:53] <BillCriswell> I'm seeing it just fine.
[09:31:00] <BillCriswell> Never seen keys used like that before.
[09:31:35] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: http://jsbin.com/acimew/1/edit sorry
[09:32:09] <not_mike> why doesn't the image in hoverq.innerHTML show whenever I add a link? (it works without the a href) -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/960/
[09:32:38] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: ok you see, that the 668 is called at second iteration?
[09:32:55] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: theres nothing int he output?
[09:33:02] <Rinthe> or what am i supposed to look at? ><
[09:33:05] <FrameFever> ok what is the problem here?
[09:33:06] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: Look at the console.
[09:33:30] <BillCriswell> not_mike: You changed the structure of the HTML. > img would only find immediate children, not grandchildren.
[09:33:44] <BillCriswell> If you put a class on each div you can do .whatever:hover img { } safely
[09:34:07] <not_mike> ok let me try that
[09:34:08] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: Ah, I do.
[09:34:56] <BillCriswell> Guess it just sorts it when they're numeric?
[09:35:02] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: Ya that works, but im getting context: undefined
[09:35:04] <Rinthe> on my own thing
[09:35:27] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: So show me what you have.
[09:35:35] <Rinthe> BillCrisWell: http://pastebin.com/BAv7U4W3
[09:35:54] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: but they are already sorted
[09:35:56] <Rinthe> BillCriswell: I could PM you a link if you dont mind
[09:36:21] <BillCriswell> Rinthe: Is post a direct child of <body>?
[09:36:51] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: Huh, I dunno.
[09:37:09] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: are you with me?
[09:37:15] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:37:22] <FrameFever> maybe it is a jquery bug?
[09:37:32] <Rinthe> billcriswell: direct meaning under it?
[09:38:04] <Rinthe> billcriswell: post is inside body
[09:38:06] <BillCriswell> Is it <body><div class="post"></div></body> or <body><div class="wrapper"><div class="post"></div></div></body>?
[09:38:11] <Rinthe> no
[09:38:34] <Rinthe> billcriswell: <body><div container><div index><div post><div post><divpost>......
[09:38:38] <Rinthe> something like that
[09:39:44] <Rinthe> ohh
[09:39:53] <Rinthe> Billcriswell I need to find within #index
[09:39:56] <Rinthe> right?
[09:40:01] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: Does that with a regular for as well.
[09:40:03] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: http://jsfiddle.net/5AEYk/1/
[09:40:22] <BillCriswell> You can PM me the link.
[09:40:58] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: mhm ok
[09:41:24] <FrameFever> so what do you think? this is not correct behaviour, IMO
[09:42:55] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: I just always assume someone a lot smarter than me did it some way for a really good reason lol
[09:44:33] <CocoStorm> hey guys i wanna make my own image slider, is it hard?
[09:44:42] <BillCriswell> Could be a good question for stackoverflow FrameFever.
[09:45:16] <BillCriswell> CocoStorm: There's so many already out there and "hard" is a very relative term.
[09:45:31] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, but I wanna learn my own? can you give me some examples?#
[09:45:41] <FrameFever> I found it
[09:45:45] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: http://javascript.info/tutorial/objects
[09:46:03] <FrameFever> "In theory, the order of iteration over object properties is not guaranteed. In practice, there is a de-facto standard about it."
[09:46:50] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, I mean, I'm more of an android programmer and I'm trying to make a cool website. THrowing in a load of plugins won't let me learn anything right? I wouldn't be able to call myself a web developer
[09:49:07] <BillCriswell> It can be a good learning experience. Most people seem to just want to get the job done. You can do a very simple one in a few lines of code to one with way more features that's a couple thousand lines.
[09:49:45] <BillCriswell> FrameFever: Also, all keys are typeof string as well.
[09:50:24] <BillCriswell> CocoStorm: Meant the one two up by me for you.
[09:50:39] <FrameFever> BillCriswell: so it seems to be that 133.5999755859375 is a string
[09:50:49] <FrameFever> and 668 a number
[09:51:00] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, when applying for a job as a web developer is it acceptable to say that I know how to use plugins?
[09:52:29] <BillCriswell> CocoStorm: I don't see why not. They can save tons of time. I also think understanding how the plugin works is very important.
[09:53:30] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, I see!
[09:54:00] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, should I download compressed or uncompressed Jquery btw?
[09:54:05] <CocoStorm> *jQuery
[09:54:21] <BillCriswell> CocoStorm: In development I use uncompressed, production I use compressed.
[09:54:34] <BillCriswell> If you're building something chances are you want to use uncompressed.
[09:54:50] <CocoStorm> oh i se
[09:54:51] <CocoStorm> thanks
[09:57:11] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:57:39] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, I've downloaded the nivo slider a plugin, how do I use it?
[09:57:45] <CocoStorm> I'm pretty new to this
[09:58:15] <BillCriswell> CocoStorm: http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/#/documentation
[09:58:49] <CocoStorm> oh thanks
[09:58:59] <CocoStorm> I thuoght it was the same for all
[09:59:08] <virgo> hello
[09:59:53] <virgo> i have this issue: i have bind mouseenter events to both, parent and child element
[10:00:19] <virgo> now when i mouseover from outside the parent, only parent mouseenter triggers
[10:00:31] <virgo> and the child where i olse enter the mouse, does not trigger
[10:01:41] <virgo> is only way to fix it by making parent a bit larger, so mouse goes first to parent and then to the child
[10:02:03] <virgo> sorry, if this is offtopic
[10:02:56] <BillCriswell> virgo: Just having a hard time following
[10:06:43] <screamingbanshee> @virgo that sounds like a bubbling problem actually
[10:07:00] <screamingbanshee> if I followed correctly
[10:09:48] <virgo> ok, but is there any way i get both of the events triggered?
[10:13:43] <BillCriswell> virgo: If you have a mouseenter on a parent and you mouse over the child, the parent one fires off.
[10:15:16] <virgo> is there difference between mouseover, mouseenter and hover? Maybe i can then bind mouseover to parent and hover or mouseenter to the child?
[10:15:52] <BillCriswell> mouseenter fires when the mouse enters the element, mouseover fires as you mouse around in the element.
[10:18:02] <BillCriswell> I think...
[10:19:01] <BillCriswell> Demo at the bottom here seems helpful: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[10:23:21] <virgo> ok, the mouseover triggers also when i go out with the mouse
[10:27:22] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, Hey so I've successfully installed the slider, but it is massive. like gigantic.  I haven't specified a height and width for my webpage, could this be why?
[10:27:43] <CocoStorm> BillCriswell, how would I best specify a width and height? just in the css body { } ?
[10:31:32] <Kev-> Anyone spot a reason why this doesn't work for me? The <select> is displayed, but no options: field = $('<select>').attr('name', key); c = $('<option value="test">test</option>'); field.append(c); $('#div').append(field);
[10:31:35] <super_proxy> hello
[10:34:33] <virgo> Kev, shouldnt you define filed as $('<select></select>')   ?
[10:38:54] <virgo> Kev you should make it like this instead: $('<select name="'+ key +'" ></select>').append('<option value="test">test</option>').appendTo($('#div'))
[10:42:21] <supper> My script doesn
[10:42:55] <supper> My script doesnt work unless there is a href (either a css or js script call) with a question mark in it. Does anyone know what could be causing this?
[10:50:14] <Cork> supper: what does your script do?
[10:58:16] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/Luq4Gdtt trying to get endless scroll to work any help?
[11:00:29] <Cork> Rinthe: are you sure you want to add the content of .post to #index?
[11:00:58] <Cork> Rinthe: i suspect what you really want is $index.append($newElems)
[11:01:08] <Rinthe> Cork: I have <div #index><div .post><div.post><div .post>
[11:01:42] <Cork> and you want to add <div #index><content of first .post, but not the post div></div> ?
[11:02:36] <Cork> also if so i would recommend doing $index.append($newElms.children())
[11:02:48] <Cork> no point serialize them to html and then back again
[11:03:05] <Rinthe> i took out .html() and it worked
[11:03:14] <Rinthe> whats teh children() for
[11:03:52] <Cork> append($newElms.html()) does the same thing as append($newElms.children()) (except the serialize part)
[11:04:10] <Cork> it adds what is inside the .post elements instead of the .post elements
[11:05:01] <Rinthe> cork: i think i need the .post elements
[11:05:06] <Cork> ya, i do too
[11:05:31] <screamingbanshee> Cork, when I helped him with that, I gave him $("#index").append($newElems.responseText)
[11:06:04] <Cork> screamingbanshee: responseText is for the xhr data, not dom elements
[11:06:06] <screamingbanshee> it was outputting like, an entire iframe's html doc
[11:06:23] <FernandoBasso> I need something that when I hover a link (or other element), an image preview shows up in the muddled of the viewport. What would you advise?
[11:06:26] <screamingbanshee> (it's evolved quite a bit since I helped him with it.)
[11:06:28] <CocoStorm> hey guys, currently my layout looks like this http://oi44.tinypic.com/307nd50.jpg As you can see they're not alligned to the centre.  How can i fix this? I have margin:0px auto; on everything to do with the navbar
[11:07:10] <Rinthe> cork: now it only loads the first page, i scroll more it doesnt load anymore
[11:07:35] <screamingbanshee> @Rinthe - that was the purpose of the event listener bound to the mouse scroll...
[11:07:37] <Rinthe> screamingbanshee: lol its crazy..
[11:07:50] <Cork> Rinthe: does the callback trigger?
[11:07:58] <Rinthe> cork: only once
[11:08:10] <Cork> ?g jquery endlessscroll
[11:08:11] <b-ot> Cork: fredwu/jquery-endless-scroll · GitHub → https://github.com/fredwu/jquery-endless-scroll
[11:11:36] <Cork> Rinthe: ugg... it's based around setInterval :s
[11:12:10] <Cork> eh... they don't even listen for the scroll event >_<
[11:13:16] <Rinthe> cork: wrong scroll thing to use then?
[11:13:38] <Cork> Rinthe: honestly i wouldn't touch that thing with a 10 foot pole...
[11:14:06] <Rinthe> lmao
[11:14:10] <CocoStorm> hey guys, currently my layout looks like this http://oi44.tinypic.com/307nd50.jpg As you can see they're not alligned to the centre.  How can i fix this? I have margin:0px auto; on everything to do with the navbar
[11:14:13] <Rinthe> how about http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll/
[11:14:26] <Cork> the browser has an event to tell the script when the page is scrolled for some reason
[11:14:33] <Cork> all the script has to do is bind the event
[11:14:56] <Cork> but instead that script sets an infinite timer to check if the scrollTop has changed; and in what direction >_<
[11:15:15] <Cork> it's beyond silly
[11:15:47] <Rinthe> lol
[11:18:17] <Cork> Rinthe: that one looks A LOT saner yes
[11:18:38] <Cork> it looks for resize and scroll events and works from there
[11:19:09] <Rinthe> cork: do u have a suggestion for which infinitescroll i should use? I do already have waypoints tho, using it for sticky
[11:20:07] <Cork> Rinthe: not really i usually just bind the scroll event and go from there
[11:20:51] <torbjorn> is there any way i can stop alert boxes from popping up?
[11:21:10] <Cork> Rinthe: $(window).on('scroll', function() { if(window.scrollTop > window.scrollHeight - 50) { $.get() } })
[11:21:29] <Cork> (it's a bit more complicated then that, but basically that is what i do)
[11:21:44] <Cork> torbjorn: window.alert = function() {};
[11:22:05] <torbjorn> thanks!
[11:25:59] <Cork> wow
[11:26:11] <Cork> that is a long list of killed users...
[11:26:39] <verism> ?
[11:26:53] * Cork points at the long list of k-lined nicks
[11:27:59] <verism> i shall pretend to understand, and nod
[11:28:44] <Cork> verism: k-lined means a process or an admin ordered the irc server to disconnect them
[11:28:59] <Cork> and normally server ban them from the network
[11:29:21] <verism> thanks
[11:29:44] <verism> i think this is maybe my 3rd time on irc
[11:30:04] <Rinthe> cork: woul di use onBeforePageLoad for all that .get() stuff and append?
[11:30:27] <Cork> Rinthe: in... waypoint?
[11:30:34] <Rinthe> cork: yeah, sorry
[11:32:17] <Cork> Rinthe: not really sure, but i think you need the handler and a $.get call
[11:32:52] <Rinthe> yah
[11:33:19] <Cork> O_o
[11:33:31] * Cork waits for a spam flood
[11:34:32] <Rinthe> cork: i think im gonna do what u suggestioned with the window on scroll thing
[11:34:42] <Rinthe> ive tried so many infinite scroll they all disappoint me somehow...
[11:38:20] <virgo> if i use bind method two times
[11:38:23] <torbjorn> for a particular div, is there a way to undo a float: left on all <div>'s in a css sheet?
[11:38:28] <virgo> will it trigger two times?
[11:38:51] <Cork> yes
[11:38:55] <Cork> virgo: ^
[11:39:07] <virgo> great, thanks :)
[11:39:11] <Cork> torbjorn: float:none;
[11:39:50] <torbjorn> ah yes
[11:40:37] <torbjorn> thanks
[11:41:05] <CocoStorm> hi how do i make it so that the navbar is in the damn middle?> http://jsfiddle.net/8LADp/
[11:43:26] <Cork> CocoStorm: http://jsfiddle.net/8LADp/2/
[11:43:30] <screamingbanshee> O.o
[11:43:37] <screamingbanshee> what's going on...?
[11:44:11] <Cork> screamingbanshee: an irc cloud service got banned and then it got lifted again
[11:44:26] <Cork> irccloud.com
[11:45:22] <Cork> screamingbanshee: "You are banned from this server- (Clearing #kinkyclient) Please do not run gaming hubs from freenode. (2013/6/1 14.25)"
[11:45:37] <Cork> (copied from #freenode)
[11:46:30] <Cork> CocoStorm: btw you have two body elements in your page...
[11:48:47] <Rinthe> cork: what is the window.scrollHeight you mentioned earlier?
[11:49:58] <Cork> Rinthe: the max value the scrollTop can get
[11:50:09] <CocoStorm> Cork, im cnofused whatdid you just do :S
[11:50:20] <Rinthe> cork: how do i get that?
[11:50:22] <toshiba> hi friends
[11:50:39] <toshiba> not able to download jquery....
[11:50:43] <Cork> Rinthe: window.scrollHeight + window.clientHeight ~ the full height of the content on the page
[11:50:44] <toshiba> any resolution?
[11:50:53] <Cork> Rinthe: just window.scrollHeight
[11:51:06] <Cork> Rinthe: it should be there by default
[11:51:21] <Rinthe> .scrollheight is not a function in jquery is it
[11:51:32] <toshiba> on the download option, I get the code of the jquery...but no downloading starts up....
[11:51:37] <Cork> toshiba: works fine here
[11:51:45] <Cork> toshiba: so right click and save as
[11:52:06] <Cork> Rinthe: no not $(window).scrollHeight just window.scrollHeight
[11:52:37] <toshiba> nope...
[11:52:38] <Cork> or $(window).prop('scrollHeight') if you want to make the browser do extra work
[11:52:56] <Cork> toshiba: nope what?
[11:53:04] <Cork> just save the page
[11:53:15] <toshiba> okay
[11:53:29] <Cork> it's sent as text/blank and the browser can render that, so you don't get a download window
[11:53:33] <Cork> just save it
[11:53:40] <Rinthe> cork: so this? http://pastebin.com/NPhVvTAP
[11:54:01] <Cork> var $index = $()
[11:54:09] <Cork> other then that, ya
[11:54:13] <kraljev4> Is this a bug, .css() reports different values as DOM .style
[11:54:15] <kraljev4> a = $('circle'); [a.get(0).style['top'], a.css('top')]
[11:54:17] <kraljev4> ["395.80207082643363px", "auto"]
[11:54:20] <Rinthe> ops
[11:54:34] <toshiba> ohh oki...Cork!
[11:54:39] <toshiba> got that man!
[11:54:41] <toshiba> thanks
[11:54:47] <Rinthe> cork: it doesnt console log anything tho
[11:54:50] <Rinthe> or append for that matter
[11:54:52] <Cork> kraljev4: .css doesn't use style, so ya
[11:54:52] <toshiba> and now that I can link into scripts....
[11:55:10] <kraljev4> what does it then use?
[11:55:36] <kraljev4> than DOM style property
[11:57:19] <kraljev4> a = $('circle:eq(0)'); [a.get(0).style['top'], a.css('top'), a.attr('style')]
[11:57:19] <Rinthe> cork: console.log(window.scrollHeight); shows undefined
[11:57:20] <kraljev4> ["395.5294330606472px", "auto", "left: 435.2794806751233px; top: 395.5294330606472px;"]
[11:57:22] <Cork> kraljev4: it tries to grab the computed style
[11:57:53] <Rinthe> asme with window.scrollHeight
[11:58:13] <Cork> CocoStorm: i just changed the bar to inline, and set the body to text-align: center;
[11:58:25] <Cork> CocoStorm: and then added margin: auto to the bar
[11:58:25] <CocoStorm> Cork, yeah i got it now, thanks cork worked a charm
[11:59:39] <kraljev4> so, auto is computed value for top
[12:00:06] <kraljev4> smart
[12:00:23] <Cork> Rinthe: opps sorry my memory failed me it's document.documentElement.scrollHeight
[12:01:01] <Rinthe> cork: I just did if ($(window).scrollTop() > ($(document).height() - $(window).height() - 50)) {
[12:01:04] <Cork> kraljev4: check the computedStyle attribute (i think that's what it's called)
[12:01:22] <Cork> Rinthe: document.height isn't the same as scrollHeight
[12:01:38] <Rinthe> $(document).height() - $(window).height() = scrollHeight
[12:02:10] <Rinthe> cork: anyways, right now it's loading the same page over and over again, any ideas?
[12:02:32] <Cork> Rinthe: you need to not use id's
[12:02:51] <Rinthe> what ids?
[12:02:59] <Cork> for the next link hrefas id is uniq
[12:03:02] <Cork> opps
[12:03:07] <Cork> *for the next link href
[12:03:22] <Rinthe> what diference deos that make?
[12:03:25] <Cork> id's is unique
[12:03:39] <Cork> so if you load new links with the new href, it won't find it
[12:03:49] <Cork> cause it will still find the old link
[12:04:08] <Rinthe> but it's looking in a new page right?
[12:04:15] <Cork> no
[12:04:26] <Cork> your just adding new parts in the current page
[12:04:37] <Cork> the .post elements to be exact
[12:04:46] <Cork> everything else in the page is the old page
[12:05:15] <Rinthe> cork: i changed it to a class instead of ID, samething
[12:05:36] <Cork> ya, cause you arn't adding the link to the page
[12:05:56] <Rinthe> hmm
[12:06:12] <Rinthe> how can i do that?
[12:06:22] <Cork> include the class in the .find()
[12:06:25] <Cork> for example
[12:06:54] <Cork> and don't forget to change .attr('href') to .last().attr('href')
[12:07:33] <Cork> or you could simply do $('#next').replaceWith($(data).find('#next'))
[12:07:46] <Cork> depending on how you prefer to solve it
[12:07:55] <Rinthe> cork: ahh okay
[12:07:56] <Rinthe> is it
[12:08:13] <Rinthe> .find('.post, .nav-next') ?
[12:09:03] <Cork> for example ya
[12:10:55] <Rinthe> cork: hmm now im getting undefined http://pastebin.com/uWT61SX5
[12:11:16] <Rinthe> i mean its not getting data
[12:13:44] <Rinthe> ops.
[12:14:24] <Cork> don't forget the $('.nav-next').last().attr
[12:14:47] <Cork> uh... wait no no no
[12:15:06] <Cork> you don't want to replace the new post data with your next link >_<
[12:15:37] <Cork> Rinthe: ok, lets back up a bit and redo this in a safer solution
[12:15:47] <Cork> revert to an id for the link
[12:15:57] <Rinthe> okay
[12:16:05] <Cork> keep var $newElems = $(data).find('.post'); as that
[12:16:53] <Cork> well actually do var $newData = $(data); var newElms = $newData.find('.post');
[12:17:28] <Cork> and then $('#next').replaceWith($newData.find('#next')); after the console.log line
[12:17:50] <Cork> remove the $newElems.replaceWith($(data).find('.nav-next')); completely
[12:18:10] <Cork> and revert $('.nav-next').attr('href') to $('#next').attr('href')
[12:18:12] <Cork> and it should work
[12:19:59] <Rinthe> cork: http://pastebin.com/H5UTbnEp it's still loading the same content did i do something wrong?
[12:20:48] <Rinthe> wait no
[12:22:33] <Rinthe> cork: its var $newElems = $newData.find('.post'); right?
[12:22:47] <Cork> yes
[12:23:04] <Cork> ya
[12:23:08] <Cork> i missed your e there
[12:23:38] <Rinthe> cork: it works, but there are SOME repeated posts
[12:23:43] <Rinthe> not repeated pages tho
[12:24:27] <Rinthe> cork: oh crap, so many problems.. it'll reload the posts from the beginning when it gets to the end lolllllllllll
[12:24:37] <Rinthe> it really is infinite
[12:24:45] <Cork> lol
[12:25:02] <Cork> well it just does what the html tells it to do so... :)
[12:31:57] <Rinthe> cork: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ should i use the jqXHR object?
[12:33:13] <Cork> Rinthe: for what?
[12:33:39] <Rinthe> cork: for this infinite scroll im trying to make haha
[12:36:28] <Cork> Rinthe: no everything you need from the ajax call is the data
[12:50:31] <annaaaaa> hi, my naked photos;d www.fajnania.rox.pl free and hard
[12:51:31] <dokma> I load some html that contains script tags via ajax call and insert in the document. after that the functionality in those scripts stops working and my hunch is that it's because those scripts were included originally. So my question is if I have a script tag in the original document and then I dynamically load code that contains that same script tag will it break the script functionality?
[12:54:14] <msoa> this expression is true?: $(this > "li").show();
[12:55:00] <msoa> i need select li inside the current element.
[12:55:05] <msoa> $(this > "li").show();
[12:55:09] <msoa> dont work
[12:55:10] <msoa> ?
[13:01:40] <ravenzz> msoa only its children?
[13:02:07] <msoa> yes
[13:02:42] <Rinthe> cork: whats the equavlent of success of $.ajax in $.get ?
[13:03:11] <Cork> Rinthe: the third argument
[13:04:45] <Rinthe> cork: should i use $.ajax instead of $.get ?
[13:05:10] <Cork> Rinthe: it's up to you $.get is calling $.ajax
[13:05:39] <Cork> Rinthe: $.get is a convenience method, for the more powerfull $.ajax
[13:06:47] <msoa> ravenzz: Thanks solvd.   $(this).children('li').show();
[13:06:54] <ravenzz> yup
[13:11:16] <dannydagger> hey.. is it possible to "change width if background=white" with jquery?
[13:12:10] <HarryPitfall> filter by CSS... never see before...
[13:12:37] <dannydagger> huh?
[13:12:49] <HarryPitfall> I believe that .filter accepts a function, so you can grab all the relevant element, and .filter it
[13:12:53] <Cork> dannydagger: it's possible, though not recommended
[13:13:10] <dannydagger> hmm HarryPitfall sounds interesting.. gonna look into it
[13:13:16] <dannydagger> Cork: why is it not recommended?
[13:13:39] <Cork> dannydagger: cause you have to grab all elements, loop over them and grab the background value
[13:13:39] <HarryPitfall> isn't just better that you also add a class when change/make these elements?
[13:13:48] <Cork> and then check the value of the background
[13:13:55] <HarryPitfall> like... js-white-bg
[13:13:58] <Cork> what you SHOULD do is just add a class to them instead
[13:13:59] <dannydagger> HarryPitfall: if i add another then the jquery seems to go out of control
[13:14:07] <dannydagger> if add another class*
[13:14:28] <Cork> O_o
[13:14:30] <dannydagger> http://colorworld.se/avion/index.html
[13:14:32] <HarryPitfall> just to say, all classes that deals with script, i just prefix with js-
[13:14:36] <dannydagger> there I have added another class
[13:14:40] <dannydagger> for the white divs
[13:14:54] <dannydagger> but the button doesnt work properly then
[13:15:13] <Cork> dannydagger: your html is broken
[13:15:19] <Rinthe> whats the difference between POST and GET requests
[13:15:30] <dannydagger> Cork: oh? how?
[13:15:41] <Cork> ?g http verbs wiki $ Rinthe
[13:15:44] <b-ot> Cork: Norwegian dialects - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_dialects
[13:15:44] <bot-t> Cork, Proto-Indo-European verbs - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_verbs
[13:15:48] <Cork> uh...
[13:16:12] <Cork> dannydagger: read a page defining what the different http verbs mean
[13:16:32] <Cork> dannydagger: data-stellar-vertical-offset="-53"alt="" <--
[13:16:55] <Rinthe> huh
[13:17:03] <Cork> opps the first one was for Rinthe there
[13:17:13] <Cork> Rinthe: read a page defining what the different http verbs mean
[13:17:39] <Cork> Rinthe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods
[13:18:40] <dannydagger> Cork: hmm, how did you find out so fast that the code is broken? is there any checker for that? and I cant even find that vertical offset in my html where did u find it?
[13:18:55] <Cork> dannydagger: source view in firefox :)
[13:19:03] <dannydagger> ah found it now
[13:19:13] <Cork> "No space between attributes."
[13:19:27] <Cork> and the entire line is read :D
[13:19:33] <Cork> uh *red
[13:19:42] <CocoStorm> Cork, hey I thought it worked until I look closer and it looks like the navbar is too much to the right http://oi41.tinypic.com/2wprm94.jpg
[13:20:05] <dannydagger> Cork: ah ok, but I dont think that is what messes up the button from working
[13:20:18] <Cork> dannydagger: nope
[13:20:28] <Cork> CocoStorm: king?!?
[13:20:35] <CocoStorm> Cork, huh?
[13:20:52] <Cork> ah, sorry missed the real part :D
[13:21:03] <CocoStorm> the photo? oh it's from a job fair
[13:21:09] <Cork> CocoStorm: can't tell what happens there without the dom
[13:21:20] <Cork> in other words an image is pointless
[13:21:44] <Cork> CocoStorm: but i suspect you have some extra spaces there or something similar
[13:21:47] <dannydagger> Cork: but you do see on my site what I want to accomplish right? the picture divs are 100% height, I want the white divs to be 50% height.. is that possible in any other way than adding another styleclass?
[13:22:18] <dannydagger> because all buttons work if I have only 1 class
[13:22:28] <Cork> dannydagger: ya, it seams to be a common theme nowdays
[13:22:52] <Cork> this is like the 4-5'th page with this solution i've seen in the last few weeks
[13:23:25] <dannydagger> I bet its popular :D
[13:24:01] <CocoStorm> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/8pXLD/
[13:25:04] <Cork> CocoStorm: you removed the comments around the <li> elements
[13:25:35] <CocoStorm> Cork, oh didn't realise they were there for a reason
[13:25:38] <Cork> as the li's is inline elements now, the space becomes significant so you need to either remove all of them, or have them in comments
[13:26:19] <CocoStorm> Cork, have the spaces in comments you mean, ah I see
[13:26:41] <CocoStorm> understood! didn't realise the formatting affected the spacing when the elements are  inline
[13:26:47] <CocoStorm> I'll try it out thanks
[13:27:14] <Cork> dannydagger: and what is the problem with just checking for .slidewhite ?
[13:28:09] <Cork> dannydagger: also have you though about solving it in an easier way?, like with text-shadow?
[13:28:53] <dannydagger> Cork: checking for .slidewhite? what do u mean?
[13:29:06] <Cork> yes
[13:29:40] <dannydagger> when i added the class .slidewhite, the buttons stopped working, thats the problem
[13:30:04] <dannydagger> I'm not sure I understood your question though
[13:30:15] <Cork> dannydagger: .navigation li { text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black; } looks good to me
[13:30:24] <Cork> why not just do that?
[13:30:27] <CocoStorm> Cork, I can't seem to resolve the spacings to the left and right of the navbar.  Any change in the formatting affects only the spacing between the li elements
[13:30:55] <Cork> CocoStorm: ok, looking again
[13:31:04] <HarryPitfall> there is a channel for "jquery plugins" ?
[13:31:13] <CocoStorm> Cork, thanks
[13:31:25] <dannydagger> Cork: hmm smart, but can I then define the shadow part as a seperate div? so I can put text and stuff in there?
[13:32:34] <Cork> CocoStorm: http://jsfiddle.net/8pXLD/1/
[13:32:43] <Cork> you missed a padding: 0;
[13:32:57] <dannydagger> and also, I will not be able to center the white div then.. I dont want it to be exactly underneath the picture divs, i want it to be centralized in height.. like they have on this site http://www.spotify.com/se/
[13:33:26] <Cork> dannydagger: the text-shadow doens't care
[13:33:33] <Cork> you can set it on any element
[13:33:48] <Cork> any text in the element or a child of it will get the shadow
[13:34:03] <Cork> all other css rules apply like normal
[13:34:25] <Cork> HarryPitfall: your in it
[13:34:42] <dannydagger> ah cool.. but will I be able to seperate the shadow from the picture? so it is in the center of picture slides and still be 50% height? like the spotify site?
[13:35:12] <HarryPitfall> Cork, everytime I ask something about a jquery( ou jquery.ui ) plugin, someone slaps me about "this is just a jquery channel, no plugins attached..."
[13:35:15] <dannydagger> like.. margin-top or something?
[13:35:18] <CocoStorm> Cork, ah I see thanks!
[13:35:22] <Cork> dannydagger: uh, like i said if you can center the text you can center the text; the shadow doens't matter
[13:35:40] <Cork> HarryPitfall: O_o
[13:35:46] <Cork> that's really wrong
[13:36:16] <Cork> HarryPitfall: just take it as they not knowing then
[13:36:33] <HarryPitfall> I'm asking 'cause I'm working with flexigrid, and want to know if someone here is the admin of github repository of that plugin
[13:36:53] <dannydagger> Cork: it is not the text i want to center.. it's the shadow.. so when i press a downbutton, the button will take me to the center of the shadow
[13:37:04] <Cork> HarryPitfall: that isn't verry likely though
[13:37:10] <Rinthe> cork: I want the html data type right?
[13:37:37] <Cork> Rinthe: you don't need the dataType at all
[13:37:43] <Cork> just use the default
[13:37:50] <Cork> (aka don't include it)
[13:38:10] <Cork> dannydagger: center of the shadow?!?
[13:38:28] <dannydagger> Cork: yes, you will understand it if you look at https://www.spotify.com/se/
[13:38:58] <Cork> you can through css grab the position and height of the element, and from that calculate the center of the element
[13:39:06] <Cork> and yes you can move things based on that
[13:39:40] <dannydagger> cool, I will try to figure it out :D thanks alot
[13:40:24] <Cork> dannydagger: and yes you can center text horizontally though plain css
[13:40:36] <Cork> vertically is possible too, though it is tricky
[13:41:01] <dannydagger> that i know :D
[13:42:15] <haleys> I am doing AJAX and I am using HTML as a datatype, but I want to split the success response (the html returned) into two vars as I want to append part of the html to one part of the dom, and the other part of the html to another part of the dom. Any ideas on how I could split the html into parts in the ajax response to be applied in different areas of the dom?
[13:42:37] <Cork> dannydagger: and no the spotify link didn't help explaining what you wanted
[13:42:54] <Cork> dannydagger: it just gave me a big install flash banner >_>
[13:43:07] <Cork> and centered area with a header and a button
[13:43:41] <dannydagger> hmm that's strange
[13:45:20] <adamsilver> Why the alert is showing but cr_box is not: http://bpaste.net/show/kMYLKrcMeU6ybmhhIaky/
[13:45:44] <Cork> haleys: send json, and json encode the html into two variables
[13:46:21] <Cork> adamsilver: alert($(this).closest('.cr_box').length);
[13:46:22] <haleys> Cork: I thought about doing that, but php script I'm sending it to is already pulling it in as HTML as it's used in other parts of the application. I didn't want to duplicate the html.
[13:47:10] <adamsilver> Cork: 0
[13:47:23] <adamsilver> Cork: what does that mean?
[13:47:31] <Cork> haleys: you could do var domData = $(data); $('#1').append(domData.find('something')): $('#2').append(domData.find('other'))
[13:47:58] <Cork> adamsilver: it means there is no child in .show_cr with a class called cr_box
[13:48:34] <Cork> and that is why show() doesn't do anything
[13:48:58] <Cork> uh... child...
[13:49:02] <Cork> sorry parent >_<
[13:49:17] <Cork> man it's way to late i shouldn't be sitting here :/
[13:49:50] <adamsilver> Cork: thanks it worked with next(…)
[13:54:02] <Rinthe> this infinite scroll thing im working on: http://codebin.org/view/4f0eea11 any ideas why its stopping after just the first .get() page?
[13:55:18] <haleys> Cork: Good idea. I keep getting domData.find is not a function though
[13:55:44] <haleys> for some reason, it's not recognizing domData as a jquery object I would assume
[13:55:46] <Cork> haleys: var domData = $(data);
[13:56:10] <haleys> Ahh, let me try that< I left out the $() on data.
[13:56:56] <Cork> Rinthe: you never replace the #nav-next element
[13:57:00] <Cork> that might be the cause
[13:57:09] <Cork> anyway i really need to hit the sack now
[13:57:10] <Cork> o/
[13:57:24] <Rinthe> cya
[13:57:32] <Rinthe> btw
[13:57:34] <Rinthe> is var total_pages = $('.totalpages').contents(); correct?
[14:00:29] <Rinthe> <span class="foo">content</span> How do i get the content?
[14:01:50] <ravenzz> Rinthe .text() or .html()
[14:09:32] <JohnnyCache> http://palletown.net/tf/tf/lineups.asp - Once i drag a player from the right menu to the field, it's snapped to grid good. but when i move it again (the same player), it doesnt work. help?
[14:19:32] <afahim_> hey y'all !
[14:20:22] <afahim_> I have text within a paragraph. each sentence is in a span element
[14:20:40] <afahim_> I want to be able to replace one sentence with another one which is hidden
[14:20:49] <afahim_> I want to do it such that when I click on a sentence
[14:21:00] <afahim_> it slides out from the bottom, out of view
[14:21:12] <afahim_> while the other text this sentence is being replaced with
[14:21:16] <afahim_> slides in in its place
[14:21:23] <afahim_> anyone have an idea how I can do this?
[14:21:46] <afahim_> i've tried a lot w/ slidetoggle / toggle / etc but it hasn't been much help
[14:21:51] <afahim_> thanks :)
[14:31:39] <adamsilver> what's wrong with this: http://bpaste.net/show/jk5WglWdjhC50wcigp4C/ … Only line 5 and 6 are working
[14:41:36] <shoky> adamsilver:  $(this).siblings().next('.credit_box')    seems like a really odd thing to do
[14:42:52] <adamsilver> shoky: i just want to slideup all .show_credits then slidedown the clicked one
[14:43:21] <shoky> what's the .siblings().next('.credit_box')  for?
[14:44:43] <shoky> make a jsfiddle..
[14:45:56] <shoky> $(this).siblings().next('.credit_box') means:   select all .credit_boxes that are next to all siblings of the current element . .
[14:51:46] <adamsilver> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/j95pZ/
[15:10:04] <bluefunk> If I am having multiple input fields, how can I select only the input from those which were entered and update my database accordingly?
[15:10:30] <bluefunk> can I achive this dynamically using jquery?
[15:10:56] <bluefunk> basically get the input only form those whose default value changed
[15:11:19] <JohnnyCache> Can I know when the user drops the draggable element NOT on a droppable element?
[15:11:53] <JohnnyCache> *How can i know..
[15:14:40] <momomomomo> bluefunk: sounds like you want to make an ajax call to your db
[15:14:46] <anew> what do u guys do when jq doesnt load
[15:14:50] <anew> like what backup plan do u have for ur site
[15:15:03] <anew> if it's a validation jq or something, if jq doesnt load, nothing gets validated
[15:15:05] <anew> for example
[15:15:13] <anew> but i have jq all over the site, if it doesnt load a lot of things break
[15:15:23] <momomomomo> JohnnyCache: That's vague - which plugins are you using, and where's your code? Paste it to gist.github.com
[15:15:39] <momomomomo> anew: CDN
[15:16:00] <JohnnyCache> http://palletown.net/tf/tf/lineups.asp
[15:16:09] <JohnnyCache> just jqueri-ui
[15:16:14] <anew> cdn ?
[15:16:17] <momomomomo> anew: http://www.websanova.com/tutorials/jquery/loading-jquery-from-google-with-graceful-fallback
[15:16:24] <anew> yeah but sometimes stuff doesnt load
[15:16:27] <anew> even with cdn
[15:16:50] <anew> like i cant cdn everything, that doesnt really work
[15:17:49] <momomomomo> then fallback and load it from your site
[15:17:58] <momomomomo> or are you saying if someone just straight up disables javascript?
[15:18:08] <bluefunk> momomomomo: So I have multiple fields for days in a week, and each day i take the input as an integer. all 7 can be filled up or only one can be filled up. How do I get the data of only those that are filled up and assign the corresponing input field names to them, updating to db after this won't be an issue.
[15:18:37] <anew> no i mean like you can cdn jq and some other plugins but stuff that is written by me there is no cdn for that
[15:18:42] <momomomomo> bluefunk: Post your code to http://gist.github.com/ (all related code and errors), and then come back and explain: What you're trying to do, what the issue is, and what you think has gone wrong. This will help people be able to digest/understand your problem. Also check this out when you get a chance: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:19:06] <momomomomo> anew: if you don't want to host it on your own site, then you can use any number of services as your cdn. many people use amazon's web services
[15:19:51] <anew> i just dont think cdn is the fix all
[15:22:04] <momomomomo> anew: So, if your jquery doesn't load from your site, you want to gracefully fall-back to a no-javascript solution? I don't understand what the question is anew
[15:23:19] <anew> yeah i guess fallback to js, suppose i have to just write backups in php ?
[15:23:27] <anew> *fallback to no js
[15:23:34] <anew> how can i detect that something did not load tho
[15:24:24] <momomomomo> anew: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828237/check-if-jquery-has-been-loaded-then-load-it-if-false
[15:36:00] <grantbow> ravenzz: thanks for answering Rinthe earlier - I need the same thing and I'd spent quite awhile trying to find .text()!
[15:38:56] <bluefunk> momomomomo:http://pastebin.com/sC1MqwLT This code echoes out the input fields with each one having a different "name" tag. This is the output ---> http://imageshack.us/f/607/88370963.jpg/ . Problem -> How can I check which of the hours fields have been chaned and have a value and how can I use the corresponding name tag of the input field to assign variables and update db. You can suggest a better method if you like.
[15:41:08] <momomomomo> bluefunk: one second, I'll paste one of my functions
[15:45:14] <momomomomo> bluefunk: https://gist.github.com/momer/5691968
[15:45:59] <momomomomo> bluefunk: note: IE8 doesn't always play nicely with the JQ $.on() function, so I've used 'propertychange change' here, which works across browsers
[15:47:11] <Austin> .contents seems to be excluding &nbsp; text nodes
[15:47:48] <Austin> any way to get text nodes including &nbsp?
[15:48:15] <momomomomo> Austin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7676747/jquery-get-raw-html
[15:49:00] <Austin> but then I have to go about parsing the html myself?
[15:51:04] <metateck> i dont know if this is the right channel for this, but im using the jquery addon colorbox to overlay an iframe on a page.  however, the iframe is transparent.  how can i make it a white background?
[15:51:12] <metateck> http://metateck.com/jobs
[15:51:22] <metateck> that is the link.  when you click on link to listing it fails miserably.
[15:51:58] <toshiba> hi friends....
[15:52:29] <toshiba> where do i paste the code?
[15:52:50] <metateck> topic
[15:52:59] <shoky> ?p
[15:53:00] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:54:01] <metateck> is this the right channel for my question?
[15:54:31] <momomomomo> metateck: yes and no - try adding a style to your iframe.
[15:54:45] <momomomomo> metateck: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[15:55:16] <momomomomo> Though, I'm not sure how you're adding it into the DOM, so that might be the issue. But that's a complex problem that might require more reading of the JQ docs on your part
[15:55:35] <virgo> is it possible to change anything inside the iframe?
[15:55:39] <metateck> yeah im not really sure what colorbox is doing behind the scenes to be honest
[15:55:49] <metateck> yes i have total control over the content inside
[15:56:05] <momomomomo> virgo: basically what he's doing is adding some elements to the DOM. I just changed style on the 'article' element that was added
[15:56:14] <momomomomo> Doesn't look like an iframe at all actually
[15:56:22] <metateck> yeah i was just looking at the dom and you are right
[15:56:38] <bluefunk> momomomomo: thanks! would you say that using simple PHP isset for this will suffice?
[15:56:41] <metateck> i just assumed it was because i had to pass in an "iframe" parameter into colorbox, but that would make too much sense
[15:57:06] <metateck> oh i commented out the iframe line
[15:57:13] <metateck> illl try it again i guess
[15:57:15] <momomomomo> bluefunk: No idea how to do the backend in PHP, but that's just a few google searches away for you :p
[15:57:45] <metateck> that went terribly
[15:57:46] <bluefunk> ait, thanks man
[15:57:51] <momomomomo> no problem
[15:58:59] <Rinthe> http://swell.stylehatch.co/ when you click on each post, it changes the url, but doesn't reload the page, the pages comes up as a 'popup'. how do i achieve that?
[15:59:00] <momomomomo> bluefunk: remember, if you add more elements to the DOM after this function executes, you'll need to call this function again. If that's the case, you'll want to make this a named function, and call it on document.ready
[15:59:25] <momomomomo> Rinthe: Post your code to http://gist.github.com/ (all related code and errors), and then come back and explain: What you're trying to do, what the issue is, and what you think has gone wrong.

[15:59:53] <Rinthe> momomomomo: what...
[16:00:00] <Rinthe> I just asked the question
[16:00:07] <kloose> someone has any idea ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16878045/refreshing-div-without-page-reload-with-ajax
[16:02:01] <Rinthe> anyone?
[16:17:43] <Rinthe> http://swell.stylehatch.co/ when you click on each post, it changes the url, but doesn't reload the page, the pages comes up as a 'popup'. how do i achieve that?
[16:19:29] <momomomomo> Rinthe: I already asked you to paste your code somewhere where I can easily read it with code highlighting - like jsfiddle OR gist.github.com
[16:19:40] <Rinthe> i dont have code dude
[16:19:51] <Rinthe> did you read my question?
[16:20:00] <Rinthe> momomomomo.
[16:20:17] <momomomomo> Rinthe: Did you add any javascript to the page to make it do something special when you click on a post?
[16:20:46] <Rinthe> thats not my page
[16:20:51] <Rinthe> im asking how to achieve that
[16:20:54] <Rinthe> momomomomo
[16:21:46] <anew> i'm sending an ajax call and it's working, the problem is i'm .show() an input on success, and there is some php inside that input tag. is it not possible to do a server call to show that php ?
[16:22:10] <momomomomo> Maybe read the second link I pasted earlier, your question wasn't very clear. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6303964/open-an-url-in-a-new-tab-when-click-a-button
[16:22:39] <momomomomo> anew: code
[16:23:29] <Rinthe> momomomomo: no that has nothing to do with it
[16:23:36] <anew> it all works, but i am saving sessions in my db, and part of that session i'm saving username.  when i echo the username from the session it is blank after i .show()... when i refresh the page it's all fine
[16:23:48] <anew> dunno let me see
[16:24:07] <momomomomo> Rinthe: I finally gave in and visited your sketchy url link. That's a modal
[16:24:26] <momomomomo> Rinthe: IE: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[16:25:21] <Rinthe> momomomomo: whats so sketchy about it?
[16:25:33] <momomomomo> anew: I'm having a hard time following your exact issue
[16:25:57] <Rinthe> momomomomo: modal doesnt change the URL tho.
[16:26:20] <momomomomo> Rinthe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10953792/change-url-in-browser-address-bar-without-reload-existing-page
[16:27:02] <momomomomo> Rinthe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/352343/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-browsers-address-bar-without-refreshing-the-page
[16:27:04] <momomomomo> Google
[16:33:36] <anew> i'm getting this from console.log(json); Object {success: false, dump: ""}  how would i retrieve 'false' from this ?
[16:35:55] <anew> momomomomo
[16:36:32] <momomomomo> json['success']
[16:36:58] <anew> if ( json['success'] === 'false'){}
[16:36:59] <anew> ?
[16:37:11] <momomomomo> if it always returns a string, yes
[16:37:18] <momomomomo> I'd do a check to see that if it exists, though
[16:37:35] <anew> hmm didnt work
[16:37:45] <momomomomo> anew: post your code to gist.github.com
[16:37:46] <momomomomo> also

[16:43:44] <anew> i used json.success
[16:53:37] <momomomomo> anew: even better :p
[17:05:51] <_Cody> want to get this classic text-color change on mouseover effect
[17:06:12] <_Cody> is there a way that does not need an extra class (for doing via toggleclass)
[17:06:59] <systemfault> You would use css
[17:07:35] <systemfault> <a href="#">My Link</a>            a { color: green; }  a:hover { color: hotpink; }
[17:08:25] <_Cody> I want for all text of course
[17:08:25] <introspectr3> if contact_id is a javascript variable, how should I be writting the following? $("#potential_contacts option[value=contact_id]").remove();
[17:08:52] <_Cody> systemfault: i think evreyone knows this color change on modern websites when u move the cursor over text
[17:08:56] <systemfault> introspectr3: No, JS doesn't support string interpolation
[17:09:12] <introspectr3> oh really? nasty
[17:09:30] <systemfault> introspectr3: Yeah.. it sucks… so you're stuck with string concatenation
[17:10:03] <introspectr3> systemfault: concat? I can just $("#potential_contacts option[value="+contact_id+"]").remove(); ?
[17:10:06] <j_wright> or a js sprintf library
[17:10:15] <systemfault> introspectr3: That's concatenation :P
[17:10:27] <introspectr3> i know, you said im stuck with concat, would that work?
[17:10:30] <introspectr3> i don't mind it being ugly
[17:10:37] <systemfault> introspectr3: It works :)
[17:10:41] <introspectr3> thank you
[18:40:35] <Roundaround> how do I force code execution to wait until a set of images are loaded?
[18:40:45] <Roundaround> there's an event I can bind to, right?
[18:47:16] <Pinkamena_D> what would be the best way to add a duplicate <select> element after a selection is made?
[18:48:02] <SeanJM> Roundaround: img.src = 'url'; img.ready(function () {});
[18:49:01] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: select.on('change',function () { newselect.insertAfter(select); });
[18:49:45] <Roundaround> SeanJM: ah yes, ready.  thanks
[18:50:01] <SeanJM> Roundaround: you're welcome
[19:06:46] <Roundaround> SeanJM: does this work if my selector contains a set of multiple images?
[19:06:52] <Roundaround> will it wait for all of them to be ready?
[19:07:20] <SeanJM> Roundaround: this is where it can get tricky
[19:08:30] <SeanJM> Roundaround: create an array of images, and run that basic command with the ready for each Once ready, push to another array: named complete for example Once the size of complete is equal to the size of the loaded images--they are all loaded
[19:08:42] <SeanJM> Roundaround: or rather, an array of src names
[19:09:17] <Roundaround> lol ow, that's so jank
[19:09:46] <Roundaround> though, not sure why you wouldn't just keep a counter of how many are complete
[19:09:51] <Roundaround> less memory and faster
[19:11:24] <SeanJM> Roundaround: so you would loop. var complete = []; var arr = ['image.png','image2.png']; for (var i=0;i<arr.length;i++) var img.src = arr[i]; img.onready(function() { complete.push(img); if (complete.length==arr.length) { imagesloaded() } });
[19:12:08] <SeanJM> Roundaround: something like this should get you started
[19:12:28] <Roundaround> SeanJM: yeah I understand the concept, but why not just keep an integer counter instead of a separate array to push them onto?
[19:12:48] <SeanJM> Roundaround: because I need to append them to the page once they are ALL loaded
[19:13:02] <SeanJM> Roundaround: so I store a jquery object in an array which I will use to add them to the page in one shot
[19:14:43] <Roundaround> right but I mean something like this: car complete = 0; var arr = ['image.png','image2.png']; for (var i=0;i<arr.length;i++) var img.src = arr[i]; img.onready(function() { if (++complete==arr.length) { imagesloaded() } })
[19:14:47] <SeanJM> Roundaround: you can do it any way you want, and if you're way is done with less steps, I'd like to see it
[19:15:01] <Roundaround> var * not car lol
[19:15:18] <SeanJM> Roundaround: yeah, that is better
[19:15:37] <SeanJM> Roundaround: except where did you store the img's?
[19:16:01] <SeanJM> Roundaround: imgs*
[19:16:48] <Roundaround> SeanJM: well you could make your array hold the jquery objects instead of src strings, right?
[19:17:18] <Roundaround> no wait
[19:17:20] <Roundaround> nevermind
[19:17:24] <Roundaround> I understand now
[19:17:36] <SeanJM> Roundaround: yeah, then it's like [$('<img src='image.png'>'),$('<img src='image2.png'>)]
[19:17:57] <Rinthe> how do i get the last one history url?
[19:18:33] <SeanJM> Roundaround: this way it would be arr[i].ready(function () {});
[19:18:43] <Roundaround> mhm
[19:19:06] <Rinthe> previous page url
[19:19:21] <SeanJM> Roundaround: the nice thing about the other one is you can just pass it an array with image names Which is user friedly
[19:21:42] <Roundaround> SeanJM: true, but I'm working with a list of images passed from the server-side.  I can pass whatever, it doesn't really matter :P
[19:21:44] <Roundaround> \(_o)/
[19:23:14] <SeanJM> Roundaround: those darn servers!
[19:23:19] <SeanJM> Roundaround: ^^
[19:23:56] <Rinthe> anyone?
[19:26:46] <SeanJM> Rinthe: what was your question?
[19:27:03] <Rinthe> seanJM: how do i get the prevous page url
[19:27:07] <Rinthe> history
[19:27:24] <SeanJM> Rinthe: window.history.back();
[19:27:43] <Rinthe> that goes back or gives me the url? seanJM
[19:30:04] <SeanJM> Rinthe: I am testing it out
[19:30:11] <SeanJM> Rinthe: www.jsfiddle.net
[19:30:34] <SeanJM> Rinthe: console.log(document.referrer); <--- may be what you are actually looking for
[19:31:46] <Rinthe> SeanJM: im trying to do some pushstate, i think window.history.back() is what i need
[19:32:57] <orospakr> Hey, I'm using 1.8.2 and I notice that under conditions i can't quite yet identify $.ajax() with dataType set to "jsonp" will sometimes still use XHR, and predictably fail due to SOP. What's the story?
[19:33:23] <orospakr> browser version is Chrome 27, if that matters.
[19:34:32] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/hS8etz0j anyone know why this works only once?
[19:34:50] <Rinthe> its a thing for pushstate, loading a url in a div
[19:38:14] <orospakr> (interestingly, a request does show up on my other server hosting the JSONP endpoint, although the expected callback= URI parameter is missing. a SOP error is still logged in Console)
[19:48:08] <SeanJM> Rinthe: http://pastebin.com/hS8etz0j <-- unknown ID If you put it on codepen.io of jsfiddle.net we can test it together
[19:48:29] <Rinthe> seanJM: http://codebin.org/view/545ec463
[19:49:33] <SeanJM> Rinthe: is there a reason you want to attach to 'document'? as opposed to attaching to the classes you wish to select?
[19:50:07] <Rinthe> seanJM: where?
[19:50:09] <SeanJM> Rinthe:  $('.post-overlay-link').on('click',function() {
[19:50:27] <SeanJM> Rinthe: as opposed to  $(document).on('click', '.post .overlay-link', function() {
[19:50:56] <Rinthe> steanJM does tha tmake a difernce?
[19:51:11] <SeanJM> Rinthe: yes--it should work
[19:51:19] <SeanJM> Rinthe: (hopefully)
[19:51:20] <Rinthe> both works?
[19:51:33] <SeanJM> Rinthe: typically, you don't attach to the document
[19:52:18] <SeanJM> Rinthe: you would do this instead $(document).on('click,function (event) { if ($(event.target).hasClass('.post-overlay-link)) { do stuff() } })
[19:52:41] <SeanJM> Rinthe: err minutes the on post-overlay-link
[19:53:03] <Rinthe> seanJM Minutes?
[19:53:20] <SeanJM> Rinthe: minus the .
[19:53:22] <SeanJM> Rinthe: ;-)
[19:53:24] <Pinkamena_D> I am looking to make a duplicate of an element after selecting something from it. I tried to apply someones solution who posted here before
[19:53:25] <SeanJM> Rinthe: typeo
[19:53:33] <Pinkamena_D> heres what I have so far: http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[19:54:30] <Rinthe> seanJM: but the clicking works
[19:54:39] <Rinthe> steanJM i think somethings wrong with the lodaContent()
[19:55:11] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/viyEg
[19:55:53] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: location.pathname should be window.location.pathname
[19:56:29] <SeanJM> err
[19:56:31] <SeanJM> wrong person
[19:56:49] <SeanJM> Rinthe: loadContent($(this).attr('href'));
[19:57:13] <SeanJM> Rinthe: post to a code pen so we can actually test it
[19:59:04] <Pinkamena_D> sean
[19:59:23] <Pinkamena_D> is this an acceptable solution: http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[19:59:48] <Pinkamena_D> how many methods are you allowed to string before using a variable is better?
[20:00:29] <Roundaround> Pinkamena_D: there's not really an answer to that
[20:00:43] <Pinkamena_D> lol, ok
[20:01:00] <Roundaround> Pinkamena_D: it depends on your coding style.  line length is really the only limiter
[20:01:11] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: even better
[20:01:15] <Pinkamena_D> another problem with what I just put, is that it creates a new element every time you change it
[20:01:39] <Pinkamena_D> like, change ones you already changed once
[20:01:56] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: then use my solution
[20:02:05] <Pinkamena_D> but then you can only have two
[20:02:12] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: How many do you want?
[20:02:16] <Pinkamena_D> infinite
[20:02:42] <Pinkamena_D> usuallythe user will only choose two or three maybe
[20:02:53] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: ah, you want to create a number of them based on a selection?
[20:03:12] <Pinkamena_D> well, its going to be for equipment they can rent
[20:03:24] <Pinkamena_D> they might want more of the same one, but most likely not
[20:03:37] <Pinkamena_D> so instead of numeric values i thought thie would work better
[20:03:49] <Pinkamena_D> I already have the php working fine
[20:04:05] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: so walk me through this process, step by step so I can understand what you want to do
[20:04:36] <Pinkamena_D> well, its pretty good now, unless they go back to select something different after they made a selection
[20:04:48] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: okay, :-)
[20:05:00] <Pinkamena_D> basically they would choose one selection, and a new one would pop up, then another if they made another selection, and on and on
[20:05:45] <Pinkamena_D> and of course their would be a remove button, making the problem even more minute, but still
[20:06:32] <SeanJM> ah
[20:10:24] <Pinkamena_D> how about instead of selecting by change, we select somehting like: if value not equal to "pleast select"?
[20:12:32] <haleys> I'm setting a var in the success of an ajax call, where the datatype is html, but I'm getting a "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:" error. I tried using $.parseHTML() while setting the var in the success, but getting a weird object that I don't think I can use
[20:13:48] <shoky> haleys: pastebin your code, and check what the response is exactly in your browser's devtools network tab
[20:15:43] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/lyfnz
[20:16:38] <SeanJM> Pinkamena_D: so what is happening here is I am checking to make sure that I am selecting an option that is more than the first one (your default/placeholder text)
[20:18:22] <haleys> shoky: http://pastie.org/7995133 (line 8 is where the issue is being created) and in console.log it displays Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <table class="table table-striped table-bordered item-orders-table"> and below the rest of the html that was returned (as part of the error in red)
[20:20:19] <haleys> It doesn't like me setting my var to the raw html, or it seems there are characters in my HTML that jquery doesn't like when setting the var
[20:21:41] <haleys> The error goes away if I uncomment line 9 and comment out line 8, but I get an object that I don't think is usable
[20:23:06] <Pinkamena_D> it was a good idea, but it does not work as intended, because, silly me selecting everything except "please select" still allows editing to create new boxes
[20:23:16] <Pinkamena_D> ill figure this out someday
[20:24:00] <Pinkamena_D> until then, this works pretty good:
[20:24:02] <Pinkamena_D> http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[20:29:36] <haleys> It looks like my error is related to 1.9+ as anything starting with a < or space (new line) is not considered HTML, which is creating the error.
[20:32:29] <Pinkamena_D> updated version, works pretty nice if anyone needed something like it:
[20:32:30] <Pinkamena_D> http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[20:32:53] <lpdahito> guys i have a question
[20:32:58] <Pinkamena_D> yyyeeesssss?
[20:33:01] <lpdahito> i have this:
[20:34:00] <lpdahito> input = form.children("input[type='checkbox']")
[20:34:09] <lpdahito> when i call this
[20:34:15] <lpdahito> input.checked
[20:34:25] <lpdahito> in an if statement it doesn't work
[20:34:36] <lpdahito> normally i should call:
[20:34:40] <lpdahito> this.checked
[20:34:49] <lpdahito> this without the dollar sign
[20:35:06] <lpdahito> how do i remove this wrapper from a variable?
[20:35:22] <SeanJM> form.find("input[type='checkbox']")[0].checked <--- boolean
[20:35:35] <lpdahito> haha!
[20:35:40] <lpdahito> thx man
[20:35:57] <SeanJM> lpdahito: welcome, :-)
[20:39:18] <haleys> Anyone know?
[20:44:38] <haleys> Yeah, it's totaly a space issue. If I remove the extra space in my HTML where the first character is a <, the error goes away
[20:49:19] <Rinthe> how can i select for a $(document).on('click', both #post && not #entry ?
[20:52:58] <Rinthe> $(document).on('click', '#post-view-overlay && !#post-view-overlay', function() { isnt working eh
[20:53:08] <Rinthe> i have no idea what the syntax would be, anyone?
[20:59:02] <haleys> Ok, got it working, but seems sketchy: http://pastie.org/7995234 - I had to do something like var htmlResponse = $(data); var itemOrders = htmlResponse[0]['outerHTML']; - which seems like it would break and not as sturdy as a find() and look for the specific class
[21:15:40] <Pinkamena_D> ok, to anyone looking for the type of "cascading selection boxes" from earlier, I finally found a pretty nice solution
[21:15:45] <Pinkamena_D> http://www.codepen.io/seraphzz/pen/xHLgu
[21:16:00] <Pinkamena_D> Thats it, I guess I will take a break now, but it you want to use it, feel free
[22:49:33] <not_mike> why doesn't the image appear on mouseover whenever I add afref (it works without the ahref)? -> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9V8e/960/
[22:51:34] <Woet> not_mike: why are you using jQuery and regular JS in the same code?
[22:52:03] <not_mike> no one told me not to
[22:52:20] <Woet> it's quite weird to mix it up
[22:52:24] * not_mike is still learning
[22:52:29] <Woet> anyways, oizn has a . in front - there shouldn't be
[22:52:40] <Woet> it's class="oiz-1" not class=".oiz-1"
[22:54:32] <not_mike> still doesn't work lol
[22:55:35] <lenswipee> hi, is there a better way than this because i think it's not right. see <a id="contactUs" href="#">Contact Us</a>
[22:56:20] <lenswipee> plan to do an ajax call to load contact us content into a dialog.
[22:56:40] <lenswipee> my main concern is the href="#" part
[22:57:56] <not_mike> woet, thanks for the protip anyway though
[22:58:21] <Woet> not_mike: I would recommend rewriting it, using jQuery for everything
[22:58:27] <Woet> and try to reduce variables
[23:00:01] <not_mike> someone in here earlier recommended that I put everything in divs or something
[23:00:08] <not_mike> because of the !important in the css
[23:00:15] <not_mike> overriding inlines
[23:00:32] <not_mike> And that would make the img on hover work
[23:01:00] <not_mike> i was not able to make it work, do you see why that would work?
[23:21:40] <lenswipee> hi, is there a better way than this because i think it's not right. see <a id="contactUs" href="#">Contact Us</a>
[23:21:45] <lenswipee> my main concern is the href="#" part
[23:23:56] <meowcat> thats fine
[23:27:47] <Blaster> lenswipee: it's very common
[23:28:39] <lenswipee> I remember some pro told me long ago that it's no longer the right way to do it but i forgot to write it down.
[23:29:05] <Blaster> <a id="contactUs" href="javascript:void(0)">Contact Us</a> is also common
[23:29:54] <Blaster> just # is more standard practice though
[23:30:28] <Blaster> The current HTML5 draft also allows ommitting the href attribute completely.
[23:32:46] <Rinthe> I have <div #overlay><div #post></div></div>. And have $(document).on('click', '#overlay', function() { close/hide both #over and #post } the problem is when i click on the contents of #post, it will close everytyhing. Is there a way to prevent this?
[23:35:50] <lenswipee> Blaster: will ommitting the href attr be compatible on all browsers on all versions?
[23:36:19] <Blaster> lenswipee:  Maybe, but probably not.  Just stick with href="#" and move on to learning something more worthwhile.
[23:52:02] <Rinthe> I have <div #overlay><div #post></div></div>. And have $(document).on('click', '#overlay', function() { close/hide both #over and #post } the problem is when i click on the contents of #post, it will close everytyhing. Is there a way to prevent this?
[23:52:23] <ufk_> hi
[23:53:32] <ufk_> how do i specify headers when i wanna send an ajax request using $.ajax ?
[23:55:28] <listenrighthavey> hello
