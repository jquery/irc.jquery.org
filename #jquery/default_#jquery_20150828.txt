[00:04:12] <Duikb00t> Cork When you would like to add an effect as in opacity or something, would you just use css for that?
[00:04:23] <Cork> yes
[00:04:37] <Uhkis> is offsetX property of click event supported in all browsers?
[00:06:02] <Cork> Uhkis: it isn't in any standard yet so i would say no
[00:06:11] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/offsetX
[00:09:24] <Uhkis> hmm, clientX seems to be, so offsetX would be element.position().left + clientX, right?
[00:09:45] <Duikb00t> Cork What kind of version do you mostly use for jquery?
[00:09:46] <Duikb00t> 1.9?
[00:16:52] <Korvacs> hello
[00:16:56] <Korvacs> I have a question
[00:17:34] <Korvacs> Good day
[00:17:55] <Korvacs> I have input1 and input2
[00:18:02] <Korvacs> on the same row
[00:18:23] <Korvacs> how can i pass the value of input1 to input2
[00:19:05] <Korvacs> hello
[00:19:05] <Duikb00t> clone?
[00:19:22] <Korvacs> I have a question
[00:19:54] <Korvacs> I have input1  and input2 on the same row. How can I pass the value of input1 to input2? using jquery
[00:21:44] <Uhkis> $(input2).val($(input1).val());
[00:32:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: currently i use 1.x series
[00:32:14] <Duikb00t> Ok me too.
[00:32:38] <Cork> so that would be... 1.11.3
[00:44:03] <Kirito> Can you not chain selectors using first or eq? e.g. "li:first > span"
[00:44:54] <Cork> Kirito: sure you can
[00:49:20] <Uhkis> Cork: turns out offsetX works even on ie11 compability mode
[00:59:03] <surianup> Hi all
[00:59:10] <surianup> I need a help please
[00:59:48] <surianup> I want the sum of the 2 value when fill the input box
[00:59:49] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/
[01:00:23] <Uhkis> before i click that, i bet you need parseInt()
[01:00:38] <Cork> ya
[01:00:44] <Cork> or parseFloat
[01:01:03] <Cork> also you need to handle the calcualtion in the events
[01:01:47] <surianup> Cork you are saying to me?
[01:01:53] <Cork> yes
[01:02:21] <surianup> I need to calculate the 2 numers when enter in the input box
[01:02:28] <surianup> no idea what I have to do
[01:07:08] <Cork> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/1/
[01:08:02] <surianup> Thanks Cork
[01:18:49] <surianup> Cork can I use the id or some else in this code
[01:19:18] <Cork> surianup: replace docuemnt with a wrapping parent
[01:19:33] <surianup> because I think it has takes previous input and sow the huge input value in that outpit
[01:20:22] <Cork> also you want to restrict the $('input') selector
[01:25:29] <surianup> Cork
[01:25:29] <surianup>  I have wrap the div with these inputs
[01:25:52] <surianup> and replace the doument with that class
[01:26:29] <surianup> but no change
[01:26:45] <Cork> update the fiddle with the html you need to work with
[01:26:55] <Cork> (leave the js as is for now)
[02:19:52] <blinky_> Hi all,  Wondering if someone could help please.  I have a php script creating a list of results.  I am then trying to use jquery to collect and store the ID number for which every is clicked by the user.  If I used the span ID to locate the click then I only get the first ID number and if I use the span class then I get all the ID numbers.  How can I collect only the ID from the click and nothing else? - http://pastie.org/10381061
[02:20:48] <norc> Hi Im making a cross-origin ajax call. When the server is down the ajax call fails, rejects the promise properly. In my debugger I see a net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED - but I cannot figure this out in my fail callback.
[02:21:19] <norc> All Ig et is "error" as statusText and no further information as to why the ajax call failed.
[02:21:34] <Cork> norc: check the third argument
[02:21:45] <norc> Cork: Empty.
[02:21:51] <Cork> hmm
[02:22:12] <norc> This is on jQuery 1.7.2 by the way (kill me if you want, but Im stuck with it)
[02:22:15] <Cork> might have to check the xhr object directly (as long as you're not using jsonp)
[02:22:28] <norc> Cork: Ive been poking that object in my debugger for a while and havent found anything interesting yet
[02:23:03] <norc> Cork: Its direct properties are Object {readyState: 0, responseText: "", status: 0, statusText: "error"}
[02:24:00] <Cork> you should have a statusCode
[02:24:19] <Cork> hmm actually that is for when the server responds...
[02:24:43] <Cork> i just realized i've never death with a server dropping off...
[02:24:53] <norc> Cork: Except the server does not respod because a connection is never made.
[02:25:14] <norc> Yeah.
[02:25:47] <Cork> ah
[02:25:48] <norc> Albeit granted, this is a special case since you are only likely to get this with CORS.
[02:25:57] <Cork> norc: you should have xhr.status == 0
[02:28:28] <norc> Cork: The official jquery documentation does not thoroughly document the jqXHR object
[02:30:24] <Cork> norc: cause it just returns what the browser gives it
[02:30:33] <Cork> norc: https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#response and https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-network-error
[02:30:47] <Cork> haven't read through them, but you should find what you need there
[02:31:14] <norc> Cork: Oh beautiful. Thanks for spoonfeeding the xhr specs. :)
[02:31:35] <Cork> norc: i've read the specs enough to know how to find them quickly :)
[02:31:39] <norc> Cork: It is a shame I cannot get more detail about the cause, but it is close enough.
[02:31:43] <Cork> so it wasn't much work
[02:32:19] <Cork> norc: browsers are intentionally vague about this info sometimes cause it can be used to attack the user
[02:32:35] <Cork> not sure if that is the case here, but it might
[02:33:44] <norc> Cork: Or it might be the vastly outdated jQuery version. :o)
[02:34:06] <Cork> norc: no jquery is completely Innocent
[02:34:20] <Cork> norc: it jqxhr is just xhr wrapped with deferred
[02:34:29] <norc> Cork: Thats what everbody says here!
[02:34:32] <Cork> to allow things like .done/.fail/.always
[02:34:43] <Cork> norc: 1.7 is old, but not THAT old
[02:35:09] <norc> Cork: That is what my dad has been saying for a long time too. I stopped believing him. ;-)
[02:35:11] <Cork> if you still where on 1.3 or so i would complain
[02:35:21] <norc> Hehe alright
[02:35:34] <Cork> but 1.7 works fine as long as you don't use the new event selectors
[02:36:02] <norc> Cork: I was extremely surprised to find out that Promise is a new thing in browsers, and aside from Edge, IE does not have support for it yet. Another reason to keep jQuery around for a long time. :o)
[02:36:09] <Cork> so events performance will be a bit sub optimal, but that's about it
[02:36:37] <Cork> norc: it is a new things in all browsers actually, not just ie
[02:36:47] <Cork> norc: and new dom apis use it heavily
[02:37:00] <norc> Im just saying Chrome and FF support it already.
[02:37:03] <Cork> one of the links i gave you was for one of them "fetch"
[02:37:17] <Cork> it is meant to replace xhr when it is done
[02:37:36] <Cork> well ya, but that is cause they stamp out new versions much quicker then ie
[02:37:42] <Cork> they still haven't supported it that long
[02:38:39] <norc> I see
[02:39:08] <norc> It is quite surprising though considering the popularity of XHR
[02:39:26] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:39:37] <Cork> they aren't removing xhr, just deprecating it
[02:39:49] <Cork> (meaning it won't get any new features)
[02:40:13] <norc> Oh I was talking about Promises. Considering the major annoyance of callback hell I would have expected Promises in JS directly a lot earlier.
[02:40:27] <Cork> promise has little to nothing to do with xhr
[02:40:36] <Cork> promise is a way to provide callbacks from async code
[02:40:46] <norc> Which indirectly has a lot to do with XHR.
[02:40:52] <Cork> not really
[02:40:53] <norc> XHR is a major source of async code in the JS world.
[02:40:58] <norc> Or am I wrong here?
[02:41:02] <Cork> yes
[02:41:18] <Cork> events, animations, onmessage, websocket the list is long
[02:42:24] <Cork> anything that does something in a manner that means you can't return the value from it is the gartget of promise(or deferred)
[02:42:35] <norc> Fair enough. Well, I do have $.Deferred which seems to get the job done nicely so far.
[02:42:46] <Cork> lol gartget?!?
[02:42:50] <Cork> i meant target :)
[02:43:14] <norc> I read gadget but still figured out the meaning you were trying to convey. :)
[02:43:20] <Cork> norc: you might want to read up on $.Callback it is a simpler form of Deferred
[02:43:43] <Cork> for when you don't need .reject support
[02:44:51] <norc> Oh that might be neat when I work with events. All my asynchronous actions stem from XHR though, so Deferred is what I need.
[02:50:29] <norc> On a side note, for the callback for say each, why does it set this to the element, when it is already provided in an argument of the callback?
[02:51:02] <Cork> norc: so you don't have to define an attribute
[02:51:21] <Cork> $().each(function() { $(this).doSomething(); });
[02:51:43] <Cork> (that explicit example is kinda bad but you get the idea)
[02:52:13] <norc> Cork: Sure. Why why not $().each(function(i, v) { $(v).doSomething(); }) ?
[02:52:30] <Cork> cause why not?
[02:52:37] <Cork> you normally want to access the element you loop
[02:52:48] <Cork> so why require that you define arguments for it?
[02:52:59] <norc> With each day Im beginning to realize more and more how horrible ´this' is, and how encouraging the usage of it seems like a bad idea.
[02:53:10] <Cork> (it also imitates how native events works in dom)
[02:53:24] <Cork> norc: what's so bad about it?
[02:54:28] <norc> Cork: The implicit nature of it. Can be window, can be the object, can be something entirely else when using .bind - it is way too magic for my taste.
[02:54:43] <Cork> norc: no it isn't implicit at all
[02:55:01] <Cork> this is always something, so if the function doesn't have one you get window
[02:55:25] <Cork> that is all the "simplicity" you have
[02:55:28] <Cork> uh...
[02:55:37] <Cork> stupid autocorrection...
[02:55:45] <norc> Cork: I suppose it is just really annoying when you come from C++ and start with that assumption from the this pointer...
[02:56:19] <Cork> norc: ya, javascript isn't very close in how the model works to c++
[02:56:35] <madk|chrome> okay so I'm trying to use jquery to save me some time, I have no clue if this is possible honestly.
[02:56:55] <madk|chrome> But I have a massive table loaded and I need to approve a bunch of things. I don't want to manually click the links, so I wrote this
[02:56:55] <Cork> it is prototype based and specially, it has variable inheritance
[02:56:57] <madk|chrome> jQuery('a[href*="manageInvoke"]').each(function(index, value) { jQuery(this).trigger('click');})
[02:57:12] <madk|chrome> Why doesn't it click the link and approve them all?
[02:57:32] <Cork> madk|chrome: js can't fake click links
[02:57:42] <Cork> it is explicitly forbidden by the browsers
[02:58:02] <norc> Cork: I suppose that is a core security feature to make XSS attacks far less dangerous?
[02:58:13] <madk|chrome> oh. I thought that but I just wanna save some time :( I'm doing it in the js console so I thought it might be allowed
[02:58:15] <madk|chrome> oh well
[02:58:27] <Cork> madk|chrome: you have to options: 1. window.open(url), this will trigger the popup blocker if you run it outside a user event
[02:58:46] <Cork> madk|chrome: 2. window.location = url, this will unload the page you run it on, so can only do it for one url
[02:59:03] <Cork> madk|chrome: nope, the console is still in the context of the website
[02:59:17] <Cork> norc: you mean the click part?
[02:59:36] <norc> madk|chrome: Is this for some task that you want to do? Something like Watir might be better suited.
[02:59:39] <norc> Cork: Yeah
[02:59:54] <Cork> norc: if they didn't have that, all sites with adds would have $('.ads').click()
[03:00:07] <Cork> and you would constantly have to close new tabs with ad links in them
[03:00:07] <madk|chrome> Yeah it's for a task I want to do (literally once). What's watir?>
[03:00:31] <Cork> madk|chrome: the simplest solution is to use window.open
[03:00:43] <Cork> and add an exception in the browsers popup blocker for the site you run it on
[03:00:44] <madk|chrome> alright, thank you very much!
[03:00:48] <norc> madk|chrome: It is an extremely simple to use toolkit to directly drive a browser, faking all interactions as if you used your mouse and keyboard.
[03:01:09] <Cork> norc: it isn't THAT simple actually
[03:01:25] <Cork> cause faking a click won't actually do the click action unless the browser marks the event as trusted
[03:01:44] <Cork> some browsers goes to extra length to catch that too
[03:01:58] <arc_> ok, i was going to say
[03:02:00] <emporio> haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[03:02:07] <arc_> i have done click() on links before
[03:02:11] <emporio> meine dames und heren
[03:02:12] <norc> Cork: Well it does not really "fake" a click, as it uses web driver to cause the same thing as if you used your mouse.
[03:02:22] <emporio> I've got this script running in the footer of my site
[03:02:27] <emporio> http://www.morerentalcars.com
[03:02:29] <norc> It actually clicks on it. :)
[03:02:41] <emporio> It's simply supposed to hide the 'Find Cars' button
[03:02:47] <emporio> but the script is not detecting the ndoes
[03:03:02] <norc> emporio: I as said in ##javascript, make a test case in jsfiddle.
[03:03:04] <emporio> NB: the button is loaded through AJAX request
[03:03:32] <emporio> no, this si site specific
[03:04:07] <emporio> i am googling this
[03:04:07] <emporio> jquery on ajax loaded content
[03:04:10] <emporio> 'jquery on ajax loaded content'
[03:04:30] <emporio> i thihnk this is the answer
[03:04:30] <emporio> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4226316/running-jquery-scripts-on-ajax-loaded-content
[03:06:05] <norc> emporio: All problems are special, which is why making a use case is so important. Strip half the code away, see if the problem remains - keep doing it until you end up with the smallest amount of code possible - then the problem becomes apparent.
[03:06:38] <surianup> Cork I have implemented the code which you provided but I am gettin gan issue
[03:06:50] <surianup> you tols me to update the fiddle
[03:06:52] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/5/

[03:07:15] <emporio> norc: simply put?
[03:08:21] <surianup> Cork you there ?
[03:09:00] <norc> emporio: 1) Clicking on some random website is not the brightest idea, so most people will refuse to. 2) You ask people to look at page, understand the context, understand the code, and then debug it for you - which is your job.
[03:09:42] <norc> emporio: If you cannot be bothered to provide a test case, then people cannot be bothered to help you find a solution.
[03:10:06] <emporio> norc: dude, this is the way i choose to solve this problem

[03:20:01] <norc> surianup: https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[03:20:19] <norc> surianup: You need to register your event handlers after the DOM is ready, otherwise a lot of things will not work properly.
[03:20:56] <surianup> norc: have you  see the code of mine ?
[03:23:30] <norc> surianup: Yes which is why I am telling you.
[03:24:10] <norc> surianup: Your DOM elements might not exist at the time the JavaScript code gets executed. If that happens, the selector on ".two_inputs" will not yield any elements, so it cannot register any input event handlers.
[03:25:49] <surianup> then what  I have to do buddy
[03:25:52] <Nightline_> Can anyone see any problem with this script, it will not go into the success function part. - http://pastie.org/10381182
[03:25:53] <surianup> please let me know
[03:26:11] <norc> surianup: Though I guess its fine with jsfiddle when you use onLoad
[03:26:35] <norc> surianup: Your code works fine though: http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/6/
[03:27:07] <surianup> norc
[03:27:07] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/5/
[03:27:35] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/ou0q307s/5/

[03:28:24] <surianup> there is the green button
[03:28:31] <norc> surianup: I cannot and will not debug 2,000 lines of HTML code with tons of inline JavaScript code. Your jsfiddle with the supplied JavaScript works fine with a simple test case HTML.
[03:28:32] <surianup> "reedem"
[03:29:13] <surianup> there is only 8 line of code in java script
[03:29:38] <surianup> just see once
[03:30:17] <norc> surianup: If that is all you care about, then the jsfiddle I linked to you shows that it works. Anything else is contained in the 2,000 lines of HTML code with lots of inline JavaScript.
[03:32:19] <blinky_> Can anyone see any problem with this script, it will not go into the success function part. - http://pastie.org/10381182
[03:32:28] <norc> surianup: The point of jsfiddle is not to dump the entire website code into it, but to provide a minimalistic setup to test bits of HTML, CSS and JS pieces together. Here too a test case would be useful.
[03:33:26] <norc> blinky_: Dont use success, use the promise.fail and promise.done solutions as its deprecated. Also the fail will tell you the reason for why.
[03:34:04] <blinky_> norc, cheers will have a look now
[03:34:09] <norc> blinky_: So $.ajax().fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { /* you can inspect your error here */ })
[03:38:23] <norc> blinky_: Also since I just spotted it, try to avoid == and use === instead.
[03:38:47] <norc> blinky_: == causes implicit type conversions, and as with all implicit things it leads to bugs sooner or later.
[03:39:16] <blinky_> norc, ok cheers, struggling with the fail function at the moment, a little new to ajax :)  cheers for the info on the ===
[03:39:32] <norc> blinky_: Feel free to ask about ajax/fail if you want. :)
[03:40:30] <palpatas> hello
[03:40:40] <norc> blinky_: Ideally you can use jsfiddle with ajax (it provides various /echo/ URLs to interact with) - that way you can share a working example with us.
[03:41:18] <blinky_> oh, did not know I could use jsfiddle for that, will try now
[03:41:36] <palpatas> I'm beginner in JS and trying to use jquery, part of my script is working but I have a bug and can't find where is the problem, please is there someone who can help me ?
[03:42:05] <palpatas> (sorry for my english I'm french :p)
[03:43:04] <norc> blinky_: http://jsfiddle.net/dyzroky4/  there is a simple working example for you to get started
[03:43:51] <norc> blinky_: fail is used identically (and it can be chained after done since it returns the same promise), except the arguments change as per documentation.
[03:44:13] <blinky_> so straight after the done I can place the fail?
[03:44:20] <norc> palpatas: got a fiddle to share with us?
[03:44:34] <norc> blinky_: Sure. Or before. Or after then.
[03:44:50] <blinky_> ah, that is great, thank you very much
[03:44:52] <dot8> Hi,
[03:44:52] <dot8> I play arround with the demo for google maps. It works fine for me. But now I want to call the map, when I click on the link in the listview. But href="#map-switch" does not work.
[03:44:52] <dot8> How can I do that? http://paste.ubuntu.com/12213314/
[03:44:58] <palpatas> norc: I think my problem is very simple for ppl using jquery ;)
[03:45:30] <palpatas> I have a main page, in this page I'm loading content of other files using .load
[03:45:41] <palpatas> from other files*
[03:45:50] <norc> blinky_: ajax returns a promise object which have then/done/fail/always (each of which accepts a callback), and each returns the same promise object again.
[03:45:55] <blinky_> norc, Is the obj variable still supplied via the json_encode from the php file?
[03:46:32] <norc> blinky_: You cannot use your php file there unfortunately because of the Same-Origin Policy.
[03:47:12] <dot8> in line 92 I want to call line 38
[03:47:21] <palpatas> in these files I have a div in wich a JS script loads content (firebase chat). When I'm loading the first page, the message from caht are displaying, when i load another page (using .load) the messages in the chat are duplicated
[03:47:21] <norc> dot8: href="#map-switch" is a bad thing to do in the first place.
[03:48:43] <palpatas> norc: to make it shorter, my problem is that when i use  .load to switch pages, it looks like the script in the pages I load is sort of "stacked"
[03:49:30] <palpatas> norc: so I think I have to load the JS after page load but when I try to use getscript nothing happens, as if the script can't load or find my dynamically loaded div
[03:51:35] <palpatas> norc: any idea ?
[03:52:44] <dot8> norc: how can I do that?
[03:52:47] <norc> dot8: Register your event handler when the dom is ready, not on pagecreate
[03:52:53] <norc> dot8: Not use <a> ;)
[03:53:56] <norc> dot8: Wait. I take that back. This is jQuery Mobile is it not?
[03:54:17] <dot8> norc: yes
[03:54:25] <dot8> mobile
[03:56:10] <norc> dot8: You register your event handler on an input element, which has no click event.
[03:57:23] <norc> Or does it? Im confused and Ill stop before I utter more senseless things
[04:09:16] <palpatas> so ? anybody can help ?
[04:12:37] <palpatas> I'm trying to dynamically load content from other pages and execute a js script on the part that's loaded, if I put the script in all the files I load, it "works" but seems to be stacking the js script on every page load (4 page load = 4 times the same message in the firebase chat, 5 page load = 5 etc...) So I want put the js script outside the loaded file, but when I do this, the js script seems to be unable to find the DOM element 
[04:13:47] <Pazician> Sup everyone, is there anything I need to download for the fullscreen API to work?
[04:13:49] <km4> http://pastebin.com/BwbrNs9U this is the same code ? array ?
[04:14:30] <idontcare1> hello();
[04:14:54] <palpatas> please anybody can help ? norc or anyone else, I'm sorry I'm beginner with jquery, tried googling it but the answers I found didn't work for me :/
[04:15:13] <BlaXpirit> how to select a 'span' that has 'ul' as its sibling? (it always goes right after the span).  I want something like  span+ul  but select the span
[04:15:40] <palpatas> Tried with getscript
[04:16:30] <idontcare1> BlaXpirit: $('span+ul').prev()
[04:16:37] <BlaXpirit> thanks, idontcare1
[04:16:47] <BlaXpirit> i'm actually also doing  .parent()
[04:17:01] <BlaXpirit> so i'm considering just   'li:has(span+ul)'
[04:17:09] <BlaXpirit> wait, what... that's not right
[04:17:27] <palpatas> lol, are my messages displaying ? ;)
[04:17:34] <taplar> li > span+ul?
[04:17:55] <idontcare1> $('span+ul').closest('li') ?
[04:18:32] <taplar> palpatas: i see you
[04:18:32] <BlaXpirit> no, I do need the span, and only then its parent. what idontcare1 first suggested is the best. thanks
[04:18:53] <palpatas> taplar: yeah thx ;)
[04:19:00] <idontcare1> great:)
[04:19:05] <palpatas> so is this code correct ? > https://jsfiddle.net/e6ugmpLu/
[04:19:32] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[04:19:43] <taplar> correct is subjective
[04:19:59] <palpatas> I have a main page, in wich I'm loading content dynamically from other files
[04:20:29] <palpatas> the other files have a js script inside to display chat messages (firebase chat)
[04:20:49] <palpatas> after 2 or more page load, all messages are duplicated
[04:21:25] <palpatas> if you do 3 page load : 3 messages, 4 page load: 4 messages
[04:21:46] <palpatas> so I think the probleme is that the script is loaded each time and then stacks
[04:21:52] <taplar> when you say page load you mean ajax load, not complete page reload, right?
[04:22:12] <palpatas> the conteneur .load thing you saw in the jsfiddle
[04:22:22] <taplar> k
[04:22:23] <palpatas> so I thins I have to load separately
[04:22:29] <palpatas> the page, then the script
[04:22:43] <palpatas> but when I do this, the script doesn't do anything
[04:22:59] <taplar> well if things are being duplicated it sounds like the same process is running multiple times
[04:23:17] <palpatas> Also, tried to put the script in the main page, same result, the script seems to ne "see" the dynamically loaded div
[04:23:20] <taplar> so it sounds more like a figure out how to tell if it is already running and not start another one if it is
[04:24:58] <palpatas> yes but don't know how to do it :p
[04:25:04] <palpatas> sorry I'm beginner with jquery
[04:25:38] <taplar> i need to look more at this load function.  how is that get script invoked?
[04:25:40] <palpatas> I tried to use getscript to make it load the script and then load the page (thinking it would execute the script on the loaded content)
[04:25:55] <palpatas> it replaces the classic link
[04:26:06] <palpatas> instead of a <a href...
[04:26:23] <taplar> i was looking for if it replaced content or appended content
[04:26:32] <palpatas> I use onclick, calling the function of the fiddle
[04:26:44] <palpatas> replace
[04:26:55] <palpatas> i use it to replace the "maindiv" content
[04:27:03] <palpatas> with content from others php files
[04:27:26] <taplar> ok, and doing it this way it still gets duplicates?  or it's not working at all
[04:27:57] <palpatas> with the function in the fiddle nothing happens
[04:28:11] <palpatas> no messages, the firebase script don't execute/load
[04:28:41] <taplar> what fiddle?
[04:28:44] <palpatas> if I put the firebase script directly into the pages I load, it diplays messages but duplicate
[04:28:46] <taplar> crap
[04:28:55] <palpatas> https://jsfiddle.net/e6ugmpLu/
[04:29:50] <taplar> well the fiddle is not working as you haven't included jquery and your urls are most likely broke
[04:29:59] <palpatas> oh sry
[04:30:06] <palpatas> no it's just the function
[04:30:08] <taplar> and even then you may hit cors errors on the getScript
[04:30:13] <palpatas> Jquery is working and loaded
[04:30:45] <palpatas> url are ok in my environnment
[04:31:11] <palpatas> hit cors error ? sry did not understand
[04:31:17] <palpatas> (I'm french ^^)
[04:31:36] <taplar> cors errors can happen when you try to access scripts across different domains
[04:31:48] <taplar> a protection method browsers implement
[04:31:50] <palpatas> it's a file on the same domain
[04:31:52] <palpatas> same directory
[04:32:06] <taplar> right, but I was talking about for jsfiddle
[04:32:30] <palpatas> yes but the fiddle isn't workng, I made it ony to not paste it here :p
[04:32:46] <Pazician> How do I make a function? Do I need to define it like $.fn.name = function()...
[04:32:50] <palpatas> to not paste the code :p
[04:33:08] <taplar> Pazician: you can just do function name() {}
[04:33:15] <taplar> if you want to
[04:33:20] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, thanks
[04:33:49] <taplar> ok, so lets see.  if you comment out the load and put in like a console.log, do you see that?
[04:34:17] <palpatas> taplar: I also tried with .append, loading content form the 'external' page then appending the script file, don't do anything
[04:34:58] <palpatas> sorry I'm a noob with js lol :p How do I do this ?
[04:35:09] <taplar> console.log('hi there');
[04:35:16] <taplar> then check your browser console to see if you see that
[04:35:21] <palpatas> mdn tells me to use console.log(obj) but what is my object then ?
[04:35:32] <palpatas> ah just for debug ok
[04:35:35] <taplar> anything, string, a variable, anything really
[04:35:42] <palpatas> okok I'm trying
[04:37:08] <palpatas> if it works it should display in console ?
[04:37:13] <taplar> yep
[04:37:14] <palpatas> it is displaying
[04:37:31] <taplar> alright, so your get script worked, maybe.  next
[04:37:31] <palpatas> then the getscript seems to works
[04:37:51] <taplar> in that function change your parameters to (data, textState)
[04:37:57] <taplar> and console.log(textStatue)
[04:37:57] <palpatas> so, if it loads, maybe it doesn't execute or it cannot find the DOM element ?
[04:37:59] <taplar> and console.log(textStatu\s)
[04:38:01] <taplar> crap
[04:38:04] <taplar> and console.log(textStatus)
[04:38:23] <taplar> textStatus also in the parameters.  may i can't type this morning
[04:39:02] <emporio> my site: https://www.morerentalcars.com/
[04:39:16] <emporio> I'm trying to hide that button 'Find Cars'
[04:39:20] <emporio> please cehck the console log
[04:39:39] <emporio> you will see I'm asking to provide .length of that button element
[04:39:46] <palpatas> https://jsfiddle.net/e6ugmpLu/1/ is it what you asked me to do ? (sry prefer to be sure)
[04:39:55] <emporio> how it's possible I get 1 sometimes and 0 other times?
[04:40:01] <taplar> palpatas: yep
[04:40:18] <taplar> emporio: 0 means it was not found, provided your doing $(selector).length
[04:40:25] <emporio> taplar: yes but sometimes i get 1
[04:40:34] <palpatas> I get "success"
[04:40:35] <emporio> refresh a couple of times
[04:40:38] <palpatas> in the console
[04:40:41] <emporio> yes
[04:40:47] <taplar> is the button being created dynamically?
[04:41:06] <emporio> yes, it is being created through another jquery script i believe
[04:41:29] <taplar> then if the process that is creating that is asyncronous, and your checking the length outside of that async's callbacks, then the results will vary
[04:42:06] <emporio> taplar: sounds spot on ;)
[04:42:15] <emporio> Going to do some research, thanks!!
[04:42:20] <taplar> gl
[04:42:42] <taplar> palpatas: alright so yes that getscript was good
[04:42:49] <taplar> now, put your load back in
[04:43:05] <palpatas> deleting the console.log ?
[04:43:22] <taplar> your discression
[04:45:18] <palpatas> "succes" displaying but many errors with firebase
[04:45:28] <taplar> what errors?
[04:46:25] <palpatas> TypeError: $(...).reload is not a function
[04:46:41] <palpatas> then FIREBASE WARNING: Exception was thrown by user callback. @https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js line 2 > eval:57:5
[04:47:00] <palpatas> then TypeError: $(...).reload is not a function
[04:47:27] <palpatas> and TypeError: $(...).reload is not a function is thowing continuously
[04:47:35] <taplar> huh
[04:47:35] <palpatas> lol don't know if it's english
[04:47:58] <palpatas> it's "looping" TypeError: $(...).reload is not a function
[04:48:27] <palpatas> do you want to see the firebase script ?
[04:48:30] <taplar> just so i'm certain, you did do: $('#conteneur').load('alt_accueil.php');
[04:48:46] <palpatas> yes
[04:48:59] <palpatas> the firebase script is in chat.js
[04:49:03] <taplar> k, sure.  though i'm not familiar with firebase so this will be interesting, :)
[04:49:48] <palpatas> https://jsfiddle.net/e6ugmpLu/2/
[04:53:24] <taplar> nothing in there jumps out at me.
[04:54:48] <taplar> lets try this.  on your load, add a callback function like you have for the get script, and console log the textState there too
[04:57:35] <ml22> Hi. When getting an event (for example click event) will the event.target.type return the specific type or a string of the type?
[04:58:40] <palpatas> taplar: sorry I don't understand exactly
[04:58:46] <taplar> ml22: the type of the element?
[04:59:03] <isthisreallife> is there any jquery plugin to resize images proportionally?
[04:59:26] <ml22> taplar Yes the type can be undefined
[05:00:10] <taplar> ml22: you may want e.target.tagName
[05:00:16] <palpatas> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/e6ugmpLu/3/ is this what you asked me to do ?
[05:00:55] <taplar> palpatas: yeah, see what that gets you
[05:01:29] <palpatas> taplar: exactly the same result
[05:01:47] <taplar> so that inner console didn't display?
[05:02:33] <palpatas> taplar: can I pv you to give you the url of the site ?
[05:02:39] <ml22> taplar: I could do that but that was not a part of the question.
[05:02:59] <palpatas> taplar: this way, you can see the error ine the real environment
[05:03:12] <taplar> ml22: it does not look like e.target.type is a valid property off of type
[05:03:13] <ml22> taplar: I wanted to know if it returned undefined if the event.target.type is undefined and it seems like it does return undefined
[05:03:27] <ml22> taplar: It is..
[05:04:07] <taplar> it does not appear to be in chrome atleast
[05:04:36] <ml22> taplar: Never mind you don't understand.
[05:05:14] <taplar> ml22: i'm console logging the event in chrome and browsing it's structure.  there is no type property off of target.  that is what i am seeing
[05:05:33] <ml22> taplar: because it's undefined.
[05:05:42] <taplar> right, that's what there is no property means
[05:05:45] <ml22> talpar: if it's defined you would see it
[05:06:03] <taplar> right....
[05:06:09] <ml22> talpar: the event object contains target which contains a type if its defined.
[05:06:27] <isthisreallife> :>
[05:06:31] <ml22> taplar: I've answered my quesiton myself.
[05:09:09] <palpatas> taplar: can I pv you ? to give you the url ?
[05:10:09] <palpatas> taplar: I think you can understand theses errors better than I do ;)
[05:10:32] <taplar> sorry, distracted here.  got to go afk for a bit
[05:10:40] <km4> how can I convert only time (12:12:59) to unix timestamp ?
[05:11:19] <palpatas> km4: mktime() ;)
[05:12:00] <palpatas> km4:  but this is PHP ;)
[05:12:14] <ml22> km4 you should'nt convert to unix timestamp if its only time.
[05:12:26] <Cork> km4: you can't convert time only to unix time
[05:12:50] <Cork> unix time is seconds since the 1970 epoc so time only can't become unix time
[05:13:14] <km4> ok thanks
[05:15:56] <isthisreallife> anyone?;d
[05:16:23] <ml22> isthisreallife: search google? if not then there might not be any..
[05:16:56] <Cork> isthisreallife: yes there are, i don't have a list though
[05:26:26] <toomus> Hi all
[05:27:12] <toomus> How to get current cursor position in input field?
[05:29:21] <Cork> toomus: you will have to fiddle with the selection (they behave differently in old ie and rest of the browsers)
[05:29:37] <toomus> By position, I mean how many characters from beginning it is.
[05:29:51] <Cork> ya, that is what i answered
[05:30:41] <toomus> eg. this doesn't work in chrome https://jsfiddle.net/22jvof06/
[05:31:31] <Cork> toomus: that's propriatary mozilla as far as i know
[05:32:41] <Cork> toomus: have a read at this http://blog.vishalon.net/index.php/javascript-getting-and-setting-caret-position-in-textarea/
[05:32:56] <Cork> hmm no that's too old
[05:33:45] <BlaXpirit> stackoverflow is filled with different kludges for this
[05:33:51] <BlaXpirit> no easy way for sure
[05:34:03] <Cork> ya, and so is a really bad source
[05:34:11] <Cork> i would not use it as one
[05:34:39] <toomus> How about this http://help.dottoro.com/ljikwsqs.php
[05:36:41] <Cork> toomus: that only exists on the window/document object
[05:38:37] <lemonsparrow> I want to highlight a row=$('table').last().children('tbody').find("tr")[0]  for couple of seconds... using jQuery.. how can I do it ? pls help
[05:39:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: set a class and then a setTimeout and remove the class again
[05:42:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I did
[05:42:36] <lemonsparrow>                         element = $('table').last().children('tbody').find("tr")[0];
[05:42:36] <lemonsparrow>                         element.css("background-color", "red");
[05:42:37] <lemonsparrow>                         setTimeout(function() {
[05:42:37] <lemonsparrow>                             element.css("background-color", "aqua").effect("highlight", {}, 3000);
[05:42:37] <lemonsparrow>                         }, 2000);
[05:42:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I get element.css is not a function
[05:42:51] <lemonsparrow> Im doing this inside directive
[05:42:56] <lemonsparrow> of angular.js
[05:43:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: don't dump code in the channel
[05:43:13] <Cork> also [0] returns the raw dom element
[05:43:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork, .. oh sorry
[05:43:21] <Cork> you want eq if you plan to do jquery calls on it
[05:43:56] <Cork> toomus: https://github.com/accursoft/caret
[05:44:00] <Cork> try that one
[05:44:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork, https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/978b6ed15ec93e35f715 didn't get you.. can you show me her
[05:44:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: [0] => .eq(0)
[05:44:20] <soft_delete> hi ! I have question about jquery autocomplete. Lets say i want to type 'jo doe' and to retrieve 'john doe' as a result. Is that possible with  jquery autocomplete ?
[05:44:59] <Cork> soft_delete: didn't you ask this yesterday and got several answeres?
[05:45:16] <Cork> or is this yet another class assignment ppl come here to get it done for them?
[05:45:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork, got it thanks
[05:48:21] <arc_> same guy
[05:49:26] <soft_delete> Yes I did ask yesterday. I dont wanna get it done for me. I just wanna know if its possible. As far as I remember you said that is possible, so i tried the example here https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#folding by typing 'Sc González' in order to retrieve 'Scott González' but seems like its not possible
[05:50:00] <arc_> not the same question though as far as i can tell
[05:50:24] <arc_> yesterday he wasn't asking about autocomplete in the middle of a string
[05:55:33] <toomus> Cork: yeah, Caret plugin works :) THX :)
[05:57:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork, https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/978b6ed15ec93e35f715 this works.. but the highlight color isn't changing after 2 seconds .. I want it to be back to previous background after 2 seconds
[05:57:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: firstly don't add css in you're js
[05:57:57] <Cork> css should go into your stylescheat and you should control the existence of a class instead
[05:58:08] <Cork> secondly you didn't add the setTimeout to remove the class again
[05:59:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok but effect("highlight", {}, 3000) should remove highlight after 3 seconds right ?
[05:59:33] <Cork> i never use the effect library from jquery-ui so not sure
[05:59:41] <Cork> i'm not a fan of them, too buggy
[06:01:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok but where should I add setTimeOut here ?
[06:01:33] <Cork> like i said add the class and directly after start the timer to remove it again
[06:01:46] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/978b6ed15ec93e35f715 here ? ok..
[06:13:01] <fas3r> hello
[06:14:38] <blinky_> Hi guys, I have a pair of scripts on my page, both script work fine by themselves, however, if I place both on the page together then the first one does not work, any ideas? - http://pastie.org/10381536
[06:15:55] <Cork> blinky_: just a guess, but are .callID inside #resultsExpand?
[06:16:07] <blinky_> Cork, yes mate
[06:16:13] <Cork> there you go then
[06:16:26] <Cork> #resultsExpand replaces the elements inside it when the ajax call fires
[06:16:38] <Cork> so the event handlers you add in the first block gets removed
[06:16:48] <Cork> (as the element they bind to gets removed)
[06:17:03] <blinky_> Is there any way of being able to collect the ID from the span within the #resultsExpand?
[06:17:12] <fas3r> I'm using nav tabs with AJAX. each tab is loaded when clicking on the tab. However, how can I do to load the first tab when the page is loaded the first time ? I did some test like checking the name of the active tab ( LI ), but it does not seems to do the trick.
[06:17:27] <Cork> blinky_: not event sure what you mean by that
[06:17:38] <Cork> blinky_: it might be simpler to just make a jsfiddle of the problem
[06:17:47] <Cork> so ppl can look at the context of the problem
[06:18:00] <arc_> Cork well the purpose of this seems to be to get the id of whatever he clicks on
[06:18:19] <arc_> blinky_ you need to use a delegated event handler
[06:18:23] <Cork> more like the content, but ya
[06:18:27] <arc_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:18:27] <blinky_> The problem is the list I am using is created by php
[06:18:56] <Cork> blinky_: the problem is without the html structure we have very little to base the answer on
[06:20:03] <blinky_> Does this help at all? - http://pastie.org/10381547
[06:20:37] <toomus> I have some string, eg. 'this is some string :some_text', and I want to replace ':some_text' with ':another_text:'
[06:22:14] <arc_> toomus https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[06:22:52] <toomus> arc_: Oh, THX :)
[06:25:48] <morphyeys> Hello guys, how to override an attribute of a button?
[06:34:23] <Cork> morphyeys: uh you mean change it?
[06:34:59] <morphyeys> I want to change the value of $('.multiselect-selected-text').val(); ?
[06:35:04] <morphyeys> tried
[06:35:07] <morphyeys> $('.multiselect-selected-text').val('test);
[06:35:08] <morphyeys> not working
[06:35:29] <Cork> should work just fine
[06:36:20] <Cork> morphyeys: http://jsfiddle.net/afkmL4n4/
[06:38:51] <morphyeys> yeah, but maybe the problem is from somewhere else ;d
[06:39:10] <Cork> well then you would have to show an example of the problem
[06:39:49] <morphyeys> I am trying to translate this library for myself https://github.com/davidstutz/bootstrap-multiselect
[06:52:45] <arc_> morphyeys what specific property are you trying to change
[06:54:45] <morphyeys> ahh I've found it in the docs
[06:55:13] <morphyeys> http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/#configuration-options nonSelectedText
[06:59:15] <anom> I'm faking a <select> click on it's parent element: https://jsfiddle.net/Lqh31ugq/ - I have a bug where if I click the dropdown it doesn't go away.
[06:59:18] <anom> How may i fix this?
[07:01:13] <Cork> anom: you could just do $(this).trigger('click')
[07:01:23] <Cork> it would do the same as the code you have there
[07:02:12] <Cork> not sure why you would feel you have to trigger an additional click on the element when it is clicked though...
[07:04:11] <anom> Cork that won't work
[07:04:39] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[07:04:52] <anom> I'm faking a <select> click on it's parent element
[07:05:04] <anom> So click .parent and select triggers
[07:05:15] <Cork> no you don't
[07:05:32] <arc_> you are using e in some places and event in other places. you named it event, so it needs to be event everywhere
[07:05:35] <Cork> you might intend to do, but that isn't what the code does
[07:05:55] <Cork> arc_: e is defined in the var section
[07:06:02] <Cork> so e != event
[07:06:21] <arc_> i see
[07:06:23] <arc_> missed that
[07:06:53] <anom> Click the orange block, you see how teh select opens? Now click one of the options and it doesn't close the select
[07:06:57] <anom> it keeps it open
[07:07:11] <Cork> ah... now i see
[07:07:23] <Cork> i completely missed the . in the .select class name
[07:07:33] <Cork> ok, then this makes a little more sense
[07:09:22] <Cork> anom: https://jsfiddle.net/Lqh31ugq/1/
[07:09:40] <Cork> though note at least in firefox you can't bring up the dropdown in this manner
[07:10:54] <anom> That's not working in chromium
[07:11:33] <Cork> i'm still trying to figure out what you're trying to do
[07:12:13] <Cork> i see that you're trying to generate events when the label is clicked, but not sure why
[07:12:53] <anom> What don't you understand? Click the orange block will trigger a click onto the <select> element within in, this will open the select dropdown. The bug is I can't close the select dropdown from clicking on an option
[07:13:05] <Cork> nope
[07:13:20] <Cork> neither https://jsfiddle.net/Lqh31ugq or https://jsfiddle.net/Lqh31ugq/1 opens the dropdown when you click the orange
[07:13:21] <ZackZarap> Hi, is it possible to extend the ui.datepicker? I tryed this: http://pastie.org/10381646 but getting "TypeError: base is not a function" at jquery.ui.js:398 (usign ui at version 1.11.4)
[07:13:56] <anom> The first opens the dropdown for me
[07:14:40] <Cork> so you've found a browser inconsistency
[07:14:47] <Cork> it isn't cross browser, so ya...
[07:16:57] <arc_> works in chrome, not in firefox. although firefox does show an on click for the down arrow as if it's being clicked, but doesn't do anything
[07:19:57] <anom> hmmph
[07:22:21] <anom> Seems to be just firefox that it's not firing in
[07:22:28] <anom> works in opera and chrome for me
[07:24:05] <Cork> you mean it works in webkit
[07:24:42] <Cork> opera is just a chromium theme
[07:26:00] <arc_> does opera also use blink?
[07:26:17] <Cork> opera is chromium
[07:26:23] <Cork> it doesn't just use the engine
[07:26:39] <Cork> it takes the chromium browser and puts a different ui on it
[07:26:52] <Cork> unless you use the old version
[07:26:58] <arc_> i see
[07:27:14] <arc_> i haven't used opera in a long time, didn't know they did that
[07:27:35] <arc_> kinda weird they would do that instead of just giving up
[07:27:38] <Cork> they dropped presto (and the rest of the browser with it) a few years back
[07:27:53] <Cork> well that is basically what they did
[07:28:27] <Cork> they fired every rendering enginere at the company at the time
[07:28:49] <Cork> so.. ya... opera is just a bunch of ppl styling a browser
[07:28:59] <taplar> wow
[07:29:03] <Cork> kinda sad
[07:29:30] <Cork> i could never come to like the opera interface
[07:29:43] <Cork> but i had a ton of respect for there rendering correctness
[07:30:06] <taplar> i never really saw it promoted, personally
[07:30:10] <Cork> now days i don't even count opera as a browser vendor
[07:30:33] <arc_> so it doesn't have any quirks vs chrome?
[07:30:36] <Cork> taplar: you've never bin in a conversation where rendering bugs was talked about then :)
[07:30:45] <Cork> arc_: how could it, it is chrome
[07:30:59] <Cork> wel chromium
[07:31:06] <taplar> no i mean like media promotion.
[07:31:10] <Cork> chromium has quirks compared to chrome
[07:31:16] <Cork> cause those two aren't the same
[07:31:24] <taplar> i've seen ie ads, chrome ads
[07:31:28] <Cork> opera is closer to chromium then chrome is
[07:31:37] <arc_> i wouldn't rule anything out as far as browser incompatibility :p
[07:31:50] <Cork> taplar: oh i've seen opera ads, it was a while ago though
[07:31:50] <arc_> people do some amazing things
[07:32:09] <Cork> arc_: if they don't modify the engine, why would it get new quirks?
[07:40:10] <anom> People are so trigger happy to mark questions as duplicates on stackoverflow
[07:40:23] <anom> just had someone mark mine as duplicate as link it to a completely different question
[07:40:30] <anom> and*
[07:41:00] <taplar> the question is?
[07:41:06] <anom> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32273286/trigger-select-click-onclick-of-another-element/32273301
[07:41:15] <anom> to be fair it's obviusly been asked before lol
[07:43:01] <taplar> gah, i haven't messed with them alot, but have you tried making your label use it's for attribute?
[07:43:18] <taplar> <label for="something">
[07:43:26] <taplar> forget if it goes to the name or an id, but that may do it
[07:43:50] <anom> Yeah tried label, they don't play well with selects
[07:43:58] <anom> because selects are OS specific or w/e
[07:45:09] <taplar> ah, it just focuses it
[07:48:23] <django_> hey guys looking at this structure: http://pastebin.com/2MrPtJY4 id like to get the height of parent and contWrapper and based on that difference add a margin-top so it stick to the bottom of parent
[07:57:29] <morphyeys> have a great weekend and a nice evening guys ! see you !
[08:07:46] <mhlio> Hi
[08:08:30] <hlvwrk> Hi
[08:10:45] <taplar> greetings
[08:12:10] <hlvwrk> Hoi
[08:26:26] <geoid> greetz
[08:27:05] <taplar> aloha
[08:27:09] <geoid> .parent('fieldset') doesn't seem to work? Even just .parents() doesn't pick up fieldset elements.
[08:27:49] <taplar> is fieldset the direct parent?
[08:27:59] <wheeei> how can I get the ID from a specific option-element inside a select ? I got multiple lists and it only chosing the first list that are selected
[08:29:12] <taplar> wheeei: how are you determining which option element you want to get the id of?
[08:29:25] <wheeei> taplar, the one that are selected
[08:30:02] <wheeei> $("select option:selected")
[08:30:30] <taplar> and you want id of it
[08:30:35] <wheeei> I have tried loads of different ways to get the specifik one Im after but I can't
[08:30:36] <wheeei> yes
[08:30:40] <taplar> .prop('id')
[08:30:50] <wheeei> I manage to get the id of the first list but I can't get the other lists
[08:31:04] <django_> jquery do something after viewport size has changed
[08:31:09] <taplar> you may have to do a .each off of it
[08:31:14] <wheeei> I've used attr('id');  is there a big difference?
[08:31:32] <geoid> taplar no it's not the direct parent
[08:31:45] <taplar> geoid: try using closest('fieldset')
[08:31:59] <geoid> but neither .closest('fieldset') nor .parents('fieldset') return an element
[08:32:16] <geoid> and if I just do .parents(), fieldset is not in the list.
[08:33:55] <django_> http://pastebin.com/RH7QUe3z
[08:34:07] <taplar> geoid: check your html.  i just did this fiddle and it is listing fieldset: http://jsfiddle.net/x80gudeg/
[08:34:29] <geoid> taplar, here's mine: http://jsbin.com/qisifayapu/2/edit?js,console,output
[08:34:35] <geoid> I don't get fieldset
[08:35:08] <taplar> right what i'm saying is if it's not listing it as a parent, that would seem to say that it is not a parent
[08:35:17] <taplar> so check your markup to verify
[08:35:30] <geoid> taplar I have, that's what I'm sayin'
[08:35:37] <geoid> You can see it in my jsbin above
[08:36:08] <django_> anyone?
[08:36:52] <robertmaxrees> gooooood morning #jquery
[08:37:12] <taplar> geoid: i moved the fieldset outside of the table and it printed the html
[08:37:50] <geoid> taplar ok.. so it looks like putting a field set to group rows in a table is not valid html :(
[08:37:54] <taplar> it may be that the dom does not recognise tr's as being valid children of fieldsets and have to belong to tables
[08:38:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:38:11] <geoid> Is there any other way to group rows other than just a single thead and tbody?
[08:38:19] <taplar> give them a class
[08:38:44] <geoid> hmm.. bit clunky but it would work
[08:38:56] <robertmaxrees> tables are clunky in the first place ;0
[08:39:08] <geoid> aye, tell me 'bout it.
[08:39:21] <geoid> I should move to a div layout I guess :-/  (just kidding)
[08:39:46] <taplar> not a bad idea
[08:39:52] <taplar> especially with the css things now days
[08:39:54] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[08:39:57] <taplar> display: table and such
[08:40:07] <robertmaxrees> do you actually have tabular data?
[08:40:14] <geoid> not familiar with display: table?
[08:40:26] <taplar> googles, can make divs act like tables
[08:40:30] <taplar> and rows and cells, etc
[08:40:30] <geoid> Yes, I do have tabular data
[08:41:12] <robertmaxrees> how are these groups of TRs related?
[08:42:32] <geoid> Well I'm just noticing that to get the layout I want I've ended up with single cells containing left and right floated divs. So the table is just giving me standard stuff like borders, alternating rows and such.
[08:43:02] <geoid> It's a budget... so there's labels and input fields and summing fields... all in a tabular container.
[08:43:15] <geoid> So it's a form, in a table.
[08:43:25] <robertmaxrees> kind of like a spreadsheet?
[08:43:46] <geoid> JS will sum values of inputs in a group of TRs
[08:44:02] <geoid> and put them in a TOTAL row at the bottom of the group.
[08:44:16] <geoid> A bit like a 2 column spreadsheet, with the first column being labels, ya.
[08:44:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd almost argue doing that layout manually instead of using a table.
[08:44:32] <robertmaxrees> especially if it's just 2 columns.
[08:44:56] <robertmaxrees> <label>SOME MONIEZ: <input type="number"></label>
[08:45:31] <geoid> It is a bit more complicated than that because some of the fields are grouped.. so there's two levels of grouping going on.
[08:45:43] <geoid> Which I guess makes me a groupie :D
[08:45:53] <robertmaxrees> sure - wrap a container around groups of what i posted ;)
[08:45:56] <taplar> grouper
[08:46:00] <taplar> make sure there's a u there
[08:46:11] <geoid> idd
[08:47:19] <geoid> so... The table is dead, long live display:table
[08:47:38] <geoid> es6 is coming...
[08:47:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need display: table;
[08:49:15] <geoid> hmm.. ok don't feel like re-doing this dang layout AGAIN... already had to rewrite dodgy outsourced code :-/ grumble grumble but thx, I learned something.
[08:50:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h132k0u6/1/
[08:50:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff :)
[08:51:17] <robertmaxrees> could tweak that a little to get a true 2-column layout.
[08:51:45] <geoid> aye
[08:52:53] <robertmaxrees> #boom http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h132k0u6/3/
[08:53:08] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[08:54:38] <geoid> tx guys :0)
[08:58:33] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, or anyoine who may know, if I have a ton of code that is dependent on the (window) or viewport and I need to "shrink" the code and ultimately the emulator it creates, into a small frame, how would you recommend doing that?
[08:58:47] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:59:13] <claytonzaugg> I have done a lot of maniupulation, but what I'd like to do is keep the code as it is, and just put it inside of a div, any div, and have that div pretend it's the browswer window
[08:59:30] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense.,
[08:59:34] <taplar> browser developer tools can simulate different window sizes
[08:59:42] <django_> hey robertmaxrees do you know bootstrap?
[08:59:46] <robertmaxrees> django_ ish?
[08:59:53] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire channel for it iirc.
[08:59:54] <django_> good enough :D
[08:59:58] <django_> well its more jquery
[09:00:08] <robertmaxrees> just ask the room.
[09:00:11] <robertmaxrees> don't ask me ;)
[09:00:20] <django_> bro im always in bootstrap and no one is there
[09:00:34] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change the topic of this channel :D
[09:00:37] <django_> wow
[09:00:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:00:45] <robertmaxrees> feel free to put it out there.
[09:00:47] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.
[09:00:47] <taplar> and if you are there, someone is there, :P
[09:00:55] <django_> lol taplar
[09:01:09] <taplar> makes you the resident expert
[09:01:41] <claytonzaugg> Okay, I have an emulator for a physical control panel our company makes.  The panel was coded out into javascript, but it's aspect ratio is based on the browser window. What I need to do, is be able to take the created emulator and place it into a div of my choosing, and its own respectiv height and width, but have all the code of the emulator still work.
[09:02:28] <taplar> is this control panel going to be like a sub view of a page?
[09:02:42] <robertmaxrees> then put the control into a div.
[09:02:43] <claytonzaugg> The only way for me to do it now, is to do a LOT of manipulation to many aspects of the CSS and javascript itself.  Instead of doing all that, I'd like to just make a div that "pretends" it's the window and so no matter how I size the div, or the pretend "window", the code will manipulate itself to fit that div
[09:02:56] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[09:02:57] <claytonzaugg> I tried the stupid simple approach
[09:03:06] <robertmaxrees> "window" is a special concept, so that's out.
[09:03:07] <django_> how do you pause for 1 second after window.resize
[09:03:10] <django_> before you run code
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> django_ you want a debounce.
[09:03:28] <claytonzaugg> This code is based on so much window, it's not even funny
[09:03:36] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg then use an iframe.
[09:03:55] <django_> pretty much i want my code to execute 1 second after window.resize
[09:03:57] <claytonzaugg> Okay, haven't really dabbled much with them, is there a good google search to find what I need to do?
[09:04:25] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg make a new page.  on this new page, put <iframe src="yourOldPageURLHere">
[09:04:26] <robertmaxrees> done.
[09:04:36] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
[09:04:46] <robertmaxrees> django_ yeah, you want a debounce.
[09:04:55] <django_> i cant find it on jquery
[09:05:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery thing.
[09:05:01] <django_> found this
[09:05:01] <django_> https://api.jquery.com/delay/
[09:05:10] <robertmaxrees> debounce, not delay.
[09:05:16] <django_> bro its not on jquery
[09:05:19] <robertmaxrees> rioght.
[09:05:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not apart of jquery.
[09:05:26] <django_> topic here is jquery :D
[09:05:49] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, there's a lot of depricated features or HTML 4 only, is it still safe to use iFrames with modern browsers and mobile devices?
[09:06:09] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg *iframes, not an apple product, and they're still safe to use for now.
[09:06:14] <robertmaxrees> lots of ads rely on them.
[09:06:35] <robertmaxrees> django_ i was giving you that suggestion because often people are better able to get assistance if they ask in a channel specific to the topic./
[09:06:38] <claytonzaugg> lol I know it's not an apple product :)  Just haven't used them in a very long time is all :)
[09:06:41] <robertmaxrees> no need to be a jerk to me about it.
[09:06:53] <django_> sorry
[09:06:58] <robertmaxrees> and http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[09:07:15] <robertmaxrees> could to a simple google search for javascript debounce functions.
[09:07:36] <momomo> is there a way to if elsa on a browser in a css file ?
[09:07:46] <robertmaxrees> momomo nope.
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> django_ http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ this is another options.
[09:07:55] <robertmaxrees> *option
[09:09:08] <django_> this is my current js: http://pastebin.com/9s2GMS7z
[09:09:47] <robertmaxrees> so use a debounce.
[09:09:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what's not clear about the advice?
[09:10:14] <robertmaxrees> also - $(document).ready(setDivHeight);
[09:10:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to put in an anonymous function :)
[09:10:51] <django_> i should use the jquery resize instead of the window.addEventListener('resize', myEfficientFn);
[09:11:11] <robertmaxrees> then do that with a debounce?
[09:11:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:11:18] <robertmaxrees> also, this is really inefficient code.
[09:11:27] <robertmaxrees> you don't add wrappers or columns, right?
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:12:39] <django_> .column is added to the divs that i want to get heights
[09:17:04] <taplar> i think what robert may have been eluding to is that, if your not adding columns or wrappers, then the only reason you'd need to change dimensions on a resize is if they are static.  if they were percentage based, then they could auto change depending on their parent's change.
[09:19:03] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:19:22] <taplar> was i close?
[09:24:57] <robertmaxrees> do you really need to reselect those elements is what i'm asking.
[09:26:47] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're munging in heights, but i'm not really sure why.
[09:31:40] <smgs> if(form1.Ecom_Captcha_Value.value == "" ) ; this is the correct id, but this does not work that is -> var captcha = document.getElementsByName('form1.Ecom_Captcha_Value')[0].addEventListener('keyup', function() ; This also does not work -> var captcha = document.getElementsByName('Ecom_Captcha_Value')[0].addEventListener('keyup', function() ; this also does not work already tried.
[09:31:54] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[09:32:07] <robertmaxrees> reading a big blob of text and unformatted code is really difficult.
[09:32:13] <smgs> okies. trying

[09:38:38] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't work?
[09:38:56] <robertmaxrees> also, your html isn't valid - you have </div> as the first thing.
[09:39:02] <smgs> does not press the submit button
[09:39:22] <smgs> robertmaxrees, ignore the html.
[09:39:28] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:39:31] <robertmaxrees> the html needs to be valid.
[09:39:35] <taplar_lunch> can select element by name take a nested naming structure? 'form1.Ecom_Captcha_Value', should it not just be the actual name?
[09:39:36] <robertmaxrees> your js is also invalid.
[09:39:49] <robertmaxrees> var captcha = document.getElementsByName('form1.Ecom_Captcha_Value')[0].addEventListener('keyup', function() {
[09:39:53] <robertmaxrees> what is this even trying to do?
[09:40:06] <smgs> counting keyup ?
[09:40:12] <robertmaxrees> what's with the var?
[09:40:25] <smgs> :(..
[09:40:46] <robertmaxrees> also, getElementsByName expects just a name - you're passing a selector in there.
[09:41:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/20/
[09:41:30] <smgs> checking
[09:41:30] <robertmaxrees> that's successfully clicking the button.
[09:41:42] <robertmaxrees> your code already works - we went over this the other day.
[09:41:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the focus in there.
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> here - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/22/
[09:45:43] <robertmaxrees> complete with an event binding for clicks on SubmitBtn that proves that it's getting clicked.
[09:46:54] <smgs> WAIT! the second last one worked. :). checking the last one :)
[09:47:13] <robertmaxrees> i already sent you code that does that a few days ago.
[09:47:39] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/20/ one works! but how to add 5 count ?
[09:47:46] <robertmaxrees> we already went through this dude.
[09:47:58] <robertmaxrees> and ditch the focus.
[09:48:02] <smgs> no.. :( i might have missed.. in excitement.
[09:48:26] <smgs> robertmaxrees it works that way only. please let it be..
[09:48:28] <robertmaxrees> we already showed you how to check the length of an input's value.
[09:48:49] <smgs> okies. trying. :)
[09:51:37] <smgs> https://bpaste.net/show/28d626a68af6 trying this
[09:51:46] <robertmaxrees> mp[e/
[09:51:47] <robertmaxrees> *nope.
[09:52:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery on the page you're running this on, remember?
[09:52:03] <smgs> checking history again...
[09:52:11] <smgs> on browser.
[09:52:26] <robertmaxrees> we went over all of this a few days ago.
[09:53:03] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/ ?
[09:53:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery on the page you're running this on..
[09:53:47] <robertmaxrees> if (this.value.length >= 5) {
[09:54:02] <smgs> checking.
[09:55:32] <smgs> https://bpaste.net/show/b3c17363dcd5
[09:55:33] <smgs> ?
[09:55:44] <robertmaxrees> ... why do you have var $this = $(this);?
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> it's just going ot make your code throw an error.
[09:56:00] <robertmaxrees> since you don't have jquery on the page you're running it on.
[09:56:02] <smgs> so.. what to put there ?
[09:56:05] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[09:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't need var $this = $(this);
[09:56:16] <robertmaxrees> just the other parts.
[09:56:18] <smgs> nothing... wo! wait..
[09:56:38] <robertmaxrees> just delete var $this = $(this);  do you understand what that does?>
[09:57:35] <smgs> https://bpaste.net/show/11c6fbfd7144 ?
[09:57:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:58:02] <robertmaxrees> are you even trying any of this?
[09:58:09] <robertmaxrees> and what's wiuth the var captcha?
[09:58:19] <smgs> if (captcha.value.length >= 5) ?
[09:58:42] <smgs> because it is working on 1 character press. i want it for 5
[10:06:53] <robertmaxrees> helluva morning.
[10:08:05] <km4> ;D
[11:05:26] <Guddu> G'day All
[11:05:32] <robertmaxrees> goooooooood morning
[11:05:37] <Guddu> Are the following supposed to be compatible with IE 9 and above?
[11:05:38] <Guddu> jquery-1.11.2
[11:05:38] <Guddu> jquery-ui-1.11.3
[11:05:38] <Guddu> jquery-1.9.1
[11:05:38] <Guddu> jquery-ui-1.10.1
[11:05:49] <Guddu> Good Morning robertmaxrees
[11:06:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:06:15] <robertmaxrees> why do you have 2 versions of each?
[11:17:20] <Voyage> Hi
[11:17:38] <Voyage> I am having a strange problem. I cannot run jquery scripts. http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/v9/index-sp-1.html
[11:17:43] <Voyage> Any clues?
[11:18:05] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[11:18:23] <robertmaxrees> two errors on open.
[11:18:26] <robertmaxrees> fix 'em.
[11:18:37] <Voyage> see line 52 to line 60
[11:18:45] <robertmaxrees> see your console.
[11:18:47] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  hmok
[11:18:50] <robertmaxrees> those are causing all your headaches :)
[11:19:53] <Voyage> really?
[11:20:03] <robertmaxrees> errors like that can break the rest of the page.
[11:20:40] <robertmaxrees> also, $ is undefined.
[11:20:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like jquery is in noconflict mode
[11:24:07] <Guddu> Is it ok to use this in IE?
[11:24:07] <Guddu> if (event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault(); } else { event.returnValue = false; }
[11:24:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:24:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:26:25] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I am trying to throw a popup error on form submit without actually having to submit the form.
[11:26:34] <Guddu> But IE is throwing that error :-(
[11:26:58] <robertmaxrees> what error?
[11:27:10] <robertmaxrees> also, if you're in jquery, just do event.preventDefault();
[11:31:22] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, This is the error http://imgur.com/5cR8egb
[11:31:44] <robertmaxrees> .click(function(event) {
[11:32:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass the event object.
[11:32:41] <Guddu> Thank u so muchhhhhh
[11:32:57] <Guddu> It is safe to pass event object always right?
[11:34:09] <taplar> typically you don't pass them.  the event handling creates them and provides them
[11:34:35] <taplar> via the parameters
[11:35:18] <robertmaxrees> *you need to define the argument.
[11:35:19] <robertmaxrees> happy?
[11:35:36] <taplar> i'm not really sure what his concern is
[11:35:56] <robertmaxrees> he was doing .click(function() {}); and expecting event to work just find.
[11:35:57] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, http://dpaste.com/2K6V1F7 is it required to pass event only in click function or in ready function too?
[11:35:58] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[11:36:03] <taplar> ah
[11:36:11] <robertmaxrees> Guddu ready dosn't need it.
[11:36:15] <robertmaxrees> just the event hanlder in this case.
[11:36:19] <Guddu> Thanks robertmaxrees
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> if you aren't using event, no need to worry.
[11:38:23] <HighOctane> I have a multi-page jQuery Mobile site. When I load the site and browse to a particular page, everything works fine. But when I press reload, it reloads that page (the base site with the Hash to the page that I was last viewing), but the page has "fallen apart" so to speak. My menu and other pages are visible and everything is in the wrong place. Anyone else ever run into something similar?
[11:39:09] <Voyage> robertmaxrees, I cant fix those. those are a lot of issues and related to the banner. If I comment that, the banner is screwed. What can i do to run both my scripts?
[11:39:27] <HighOctane> In order to show that page correctly again I have to (1) remove the hash + page id from the address bar of the browser, then press Enter to load the page, then navigate to the page I wanted to view.
[11:39:31] <robertmaxrees> Voyage you need to fix the js errors.
[11:39:34] <robertmaxrees> not sure what elkse to say.
[11:39:58] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  it says "not a function" but the banner is runing on those functions......
[11:40:00] <robertmaxrees> Voyage also, use jQuery instead of $
[11:40:19] <Voyage> what do you mean by  use jQuery instead of $
[11:40:25] <robertmaxrees> jQuery() instead of $()
[11:40:37] <Voyage> when did that change happened?
[11:40:43] <robertmaxrees> it didn't.
[11:40:45] <robertmaxrees> if you go to the console and type $.fn.jquery you'll get an error.
[11:40:53] <robertmaxrees> if you do jQuery.fn.jquery, it works.
[11:41:00] <Voyage> k
[11:41:02] <robertmaxrees> means your site is in noConflict mode
[11:41:09] <momomo> anyone knows if this is possible in less or sass? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32277755/lesscss-generate-css-from-parent-class-until-nested-caller
[11:41:21] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  is there a work around?
[11:41:26] <Voyage> to my problem
[11:41:37] <robertmaxrees> try using jQuery instead of $#
[11:41:39] <robertmaxrees> * $
[11:41:41] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  I just need to show/hide some dives
[11:41:43] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[11:41:51] <robertmaxrees> if not, you need to fix your JS errors.
[11:43:12] <Voyage> I did <script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js">
[11:43:12] <Voyage> </script>
[11:43:12] <Voyage> <script> alert( "Handler for .click() called." ); and it works But its not working for the second line which is:jQuery( "#button-show-circles" ).click(function() {
[11:43:13] <Voyage> 	alert( "Handler for .click() called." );
[11:43:24] <robertmaxrees> hey don't paste code in the channel.
[11:43:25] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[11:43:32] <Voyage> ...});
[11:43:38] <Voyage> ok
[11:43:39] <robertmaxrees> and sound slike you've got a bigger problem then.
[11:43:42] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[11:44:45] <robertmaxrees> I'm not getting that alert fwiw
[11:45:37] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  see line 9 to 22 http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/v9/index-sp-1.html
[11:45:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your issue is those errors.
[11:46:17] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're trying to use those plugins before they exist.
[11:46:31] <Voyage> but those application.js is not even loaded yet (why line 9 to 22 runs
[11:46:36] <robertmaxrees> oh looks like jquery was aliased to gfx
[11:47:48] <Voyage> but those application.js and errors are not even loaded yet (when line 9 to 22 runs)
[11:48:32] <robertmaxrees> 9 to 22 on what?
[11:48:35] <robertmaxrees> the page source?
[11:48:43] <Voyage> yes
[11:48:44] <robertmaxrees> because i don't see any js there.
[11:48:47] <Voyage> page source
[11:49:13] <robertmaxrees> and your code would need to run after jquery is loaded.
[11:49:36] <Voyage> yes. jquery is loaded on line 7
[11:49:37] <robertmaxrees> $( document ).ready(function() { -> jQuery( document ).ready(function() { or gfx( document ).ready(function() {
[11:49:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any of that here.
[11:49:55] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/KTUMSHd.png
[11:50:16] <Voyage> refreh
[11:50:19] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[11:50:22] <Voyage> refresh*
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> hah
[11:50:32] <robertmaxrees> there it is.
[11:51:02] <robertmaxrees> kill the alert - try console.log(jQuery( "#button-show-circles" ).length);
[11:51:05] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[11:52:00] <robertmaxrees> is all of this generated via js or something?
[11:54:50] <Voyage> I got it working. let me upload it again
[11:55:34] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix?
[11:56:20] <Voyage> robertmaxrees,  refresh again and see line 9 afterwards
[11:56:30] <robertmaxrees> how about you just tell me :)
[11:56:40] <Voyage> click the 'show more' text
[11:56:45] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix?
[11:56:47] <Voyage> dont know.. really.
[11:56:55] <Voyage> thats what I wanted to ask you...
[11:57:01] <robertmaxrees> so what did you do?
[11:57:27] <robertmaxrees> also, you're loading jquery twice on that page it looks like.
[11:58:09] <Voyage> let me see
[11:58:38] <Voyage> no, jquery is only once
[11:58:51] <Voyage> i just did a jQuery()..
[11:58:56] <Voyage> instead of $
[11:59:12] <robertmaxrees> thought application.js was loading it.
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[12:23:38] <Voyage> I have  a problem I cant solve with transparency or opacity. or css transitions. See http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/v9/index-sp-1.html it has a 'show more' text below circled icons. I want the exact current feature (implemented already when you click it) but linearity / ease/fade/appear kind of thing. (the 'show more' text should move up and down on clicks)
[12:23:54] <robertmaxrees> hey so we ask for fiddles in cases like this.
[12:32:18] <HighOctane> just in case....
[12:32:20] <HighOctane> I have a multi-page jQuery Mobile site. When I load the site and browse to a particular page, everything works fine. But when I press reload, it reloads that page (the base site with the Hash to the page that I was last viewing), but the page has "fallen apart" so to speak. My menu and other pages are visible and everything is in the wrong place. Anyone else ever run into something similar?
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might be doint something funky with your setup?
[12:42:09] <taplar> its been a debug friday, :/
[12:56:16] <os-11258> hello; is there a way to have an alertbox pop up, but the jquery script continue running?
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:56:33] <robertmaxrees> this is why alerts are bad/
[12:56:36] <os-11258> clearly
[12:56:40] <os-11258> :(
[12:56:59] <robertmaxrees> use a modal instead.
[12:57:03] <os-11258> I suppose I could just display a hidden div of sorts
[13:00:28] <Voyage> I have  a problem I cant solve with transparency or opacity. or css transitions. See http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/v9/index-sp-1.html it has a 'show more' text below circled icons. I want the exact current feature (implemented already when you click it) but linearity / ease/fade/appear kind of thing. (the 'show more' text should move up and down on clicks)
[13:26:47] <os-11258> oh man, robertmaxrees thanks a million; that was very easy to figure out once you told me what I should be using!
[13:26:50] <os-11258> have a great weekend
[13:43:48] <Scriptonaut> hi, I have $(document).on 'submit', form, (e) ->. It works when I hit enter, but now when I click the submit button, anyone know why this could be?
[13:44:09] <Scriptonaut> ah sorry, just realized the form was closed early
[14:14:52] <roger1> Hi, Why would: docuement.getElementById("#profile_foo@foo.com"); work but: $("#profile_foo@foo.com") returns: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #profile_foo@foo.com ?
[14:15:27] <snover> i don’t know why you think the first one would work, it would not
[14:15:37] <snover> unless your id literally started with #
[14:15:59] <roger1> sorry the first snover typo i don't have the # on the first one.
[14:16:10] <roger1> document.getElementById("profile_foo@foo.com")
[14:16:29] <snover> the string passed to jQuery is a CSS selector, which has different rules
[14:16:48] <snover> so you have to correctly escape any special characters if you are going to use it
[14:16:58] <snover> but if you can get an element with getElementById then you don’t need jquery
[14:17:45] <roger1> snover:  i'd rather just use all jquery. Is there a method i can call which will escape this stuff more me?
[14:18:18] <snover> no
[14:19:06] <roger1> thanks for the info snover!
[14:19:28] <roger1> oh sorry one more question.
[14:20:22] <roger1> I have $('.foo').click(function() { console.log($(this).parents());  } but it's not detecting the parents.
[14:21:15] <roger1> I have : <div class='bar'><span class='foo'></div> ; I would expect it to return the outer parent div?
[14:24:39] <mentoc> I have an ajax call. This ajax call gets html. Once the callback ".done" is called with the response from the server, it populates an html element with the response. The response gets rendered fine as you can use $("#renderedStuff").val(1234) and it works fine. The problem is I'm trying to call datetimepicker on the response html and it's just not having it. Any ideas?
[14:27:01] <claytonzaugg> How would I keep an image with a square hole in the middle centered with a div inside the hole, no matter how the user adjusts the browser the image from the div inside the square hole always stays lined up inside it
[15:20:16] <TwstdElf> hey all, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here:  $("img").wrap("<figure class='figure-image'></figure"); $("img.do-add").parent("figure").addClass("added-class"); ?
[15:20:57] <TwstdElf> the 'wrapping' part works fine, but I can't get it to add the class in the 2nd part?
[15:21:01] <robertmaxrees> .do-add?
[15:21:09] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[15:21:10] <TwstdElf> just a class name
[15:21:16] <TwstdElf> k
[15:23:51] <TwstdElf> oh, strange? now it's working as standalone - must be a conflict interfering. Sorry about that, but breaking it out at least showed me that, so I appreciate it. :)
[15:24:00] <robertmaxrees> try some console logs and things
[15:24:03] <robertmaxrees> see if it becomes apparent there.
[15:26:41] <TwstdElf> will do, thanks!
[15:51:01] <tasaif> mentoc, was your question answered?
[15:51:14] <anom> hai bros
[15:51:27] <anom> $('.notesform textarea').val(); - is there a jquery function that will convert new lines to brs?
[15:51:36] <anom> in php we have nl2br()
[15:55:48] <anom> nevermind
[15:57:19] <tasaif> Voyage, was your question answered?
[15:57:35] <larzen1> Folks... If i have to register something like this in a component that may have multiple instances... jQuery(document).on('click', function(e) { ---- how do i "unregister" it after?
[15:57:54] <larzen1> is there some unique ID or something I can store to .off it after?
[15:57:57] <robertmaxrees> don't - use a delegated listener.
[15:58:11] <larzen1> robertmaxrees: how would I do that?
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[15:58:36] <robertmaxrees> or bind lower than document.
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:58:51] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[16:00:26] <tasaif> welcome to #jquery where the solution is usually event delegation and the points dont matter
[16:00:37] <larzen1> ;) perfect!
[16:09:19] <larzen1> tasaif: but this solution is the same problem no?
[16:09:34] <larzen1> if i run off('evemt
[16:09:50] <larzen1> off('event', child) -- what happens?
[16:10:12] <larzen1> consider that i have multiple instances of the object that registers this click event
[16:11:40] <larzen1> if i destroy two objects,and one remains, I am concerned that all the delegate events will be deleted
[16:11:43] <expedion> Howdy
[16:13:52] <expedion> I built this little function for tables. What it basically does is add for each th and td a class that is equal to the index of it. So first TD would be td-1, second td would be td-2 etc etc. Same applies to th (th-1, th-2, etc etc). Thing is though, if I have multiple tables on one page it just basically applies the index count from all the tables. So if I have table 1 that has 12 td's wherin the last td would have a class of td-12,
[16:13:53] <expedion>  the next table would have its td start with td-13 instead of td-1.
[16:14:22] <expedion> Any idea how I could prevent that from happening? If it was on click it would've been easier :D but it's not in this case :(
[16:15:32] <expedion> Here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/ZyS1QwzA
[16:20:30] <tasaif> larzen1, what?
[16:21:07] <tasaif> I don't quite understand the problem, but would using a combination of event delegation and changing the class on the objects fix your problem?
[16:21:43] <tasaif> expedion, can I ask why you're doing this? (I'm worried you might be reinventing wheels)
[16:21:47] <larzen1> tasaif: if i register a click event using this event delegation method... in say 12 identical objects
[16:22:20] <larzen1> tasaif: then i destroy one of them, will the 11 remaining objects still have their click register event fire?
[16:22:27] <tasaif> yes
[16:22:52] <tasaif> events bubble through their parents until they reach the root of the DOM
[16:23:05] <tasaif> (or if they're stopped manually)
[16:23:20] <tasaif> and because you're binding to the parent, it doesn't matter what the children are
[16:24:33] <tasaif> expedion, I think you can do what you want by using the nth-child pseudo-selector
[16:24:48] <tasaif> without having to put a specific class on each element
[16:27:45] <larzen1> this is how I am now registering my event: jQuery(document).on('click', '#trafficApp', function(e) {
[16:28:03] <larzen1> were #trafficApp is an ID of a container that sits right under the body.
[16:28:16] <larzen1> On destroy, I am doing this: jQuery(document).off('click', '#trafficApp');
[16:29:26] <tasaif> why do you want to remove the binding?
[16:29:43] <larzen1> no longer required by that instance
[16:29:56] <larzen1> or are you saying I shouldn't remove the binding?
[16:30:05] <tasaif> I believe that would be best
[16:30:07] <larzen1> the issue is that as I create/delete these controls, I am going to get new bindings created each time
[16:30:17] <tasaif> is the behaviour going to change?
[16:30:23] <expedion> Tasaif, I am trying to add classes to a table so that I can later on adjust certain td's and th's through CSS.
[16:30:36] <expedion> Certain tables are a bit custom tailored and using nth's in CSS would be a dangerous practise.
[16:30:47] <larzen1> tasaif: well, i create my controls dynamically.
[16:30:52] <expedion> So I'd prefer to target td's by classes through CSS :)
[16:31:16] <larzen1> I am going to call this jQuery(document).on('click', '#trafficApp', function(e) {  potentially every time that the little popup comes up.
[16:31:21] <expedion> Sorry for the late reply, darn xChat isn't notifying me :/.
[16:31:29] <larzen1> so I am wondering if destroying the popup/dom element automatically cleans this up?
[16:34:57] <tasaif> You are binding to the document object. When you click on #trafficApp, a 'click' event is triggered on #trafficApp and each of its parents (in order). When the document object receives this event, it checks to see if the source came from #trafficApp. If it did come from #trafficApp, it runs the callback function that you provided when you ran "jquery(obj).on(event, childclass, callback)"
[16:35:58] <tasaif> So the binding exists on the document object, not on the children. Removing and creating new children will not effect the binding.
[16:37:03] <tasaif> Does that answer your question or am I off the mark?
[16:39:18] <tasaif> expedion, I see
[16:39:37] <expedion> :)
[16:39:38] <tasaif> you want to do .each on the tables, not on the ths/tds
[16:39:46] <expedion> Hmmm
[16:39:50] <tasaif> I don't agree with what you're doing, but gimme a sec
[16:40:24] <expedion> Ok, and I am absolutely  open to the solution you might have in terms of a different approach as well mate.
[16:41:33] <tasaif> expedion, http://jsfiddle.net/nhvg8bzk/
[16:43:10] <tasaif> Can you give more details about how many tables there are or how the rows are 'custom tailored' or any context that you think might be relevant.
[16:44:24] <expedion> Sec Tasaif let me have a look at your fiddle first :)
[16:45:05] <tasaif> the problem was that you were aggregating all of the tds into a single container
[16:45:52] <expedion> Your code makes absolute sense.
[16:47:00] <expedion> Hmmm only one thing with the TD's that I see is that it continues to the next tr with the last index of the previous tr's td.
[16:47:25] <expedion> So if top tr had td-8, the td on the next tr would have td-9 instead of td-1
[16:47:35] <tasaif> that's the same problem
[16:47:45] <tasaif> you're aggregating all of the tds into a single container
[16:48:28] <expedion> Hmmm yeah, trying to find a way around that issue.
[16:48:41] <expedion> Aaaaaah I think I know :). Sec.
[16:50:12] <expedion> Fixed, all I had to do is $('table tr').each(function() instead of $('table').each(function()
[16:50:55] <tasaif> cool
[16:51:31] <expedion> So in regards to your question about why I want to do this. It's because the tables in my dashboard are sort of not the usual bootstrap jazz. It varies in its design, some tables have a certain element in them that requires to be targetted specifically per td, like an image in a TD for example that's displayed in a certain way.
[16:52:06] <expedion> Some tables would need to display the image differently then the other one. So the best way I figured would be to give a .tableName and from there on target the td/ths
[16:52:32] <expedion> <--- I really fucking hate bootstrap :)
[16:52:44] <tasaif> language please
[16:52:47] <tasaif> there are adults in here
[16:53:30] <expedion> Yeah can't change what's written unfortunately. Sorry.
[16:53:49] <tasaif> Why not just give the specific cells you're targeting their own classes?
[16:53:54] <tasaif> instead of everything?
[16:54:51] <expedion> I could perhaps do that later on once we get the backend coding going. So that the td's in a row that have a specific styling would only generate a class to it.
[16:55:15] <expedion> I agree of course it would be silly to have a class to a td that serves no purpose.
[16:55:47] <expedion> The data is going to be dynamically generated as well.
[16:56:07] <expedion> Could do that yeah have to see :)
[16:57:23] <expedion> Thanks Tasaif for helping me out, really appreciate it.
[16:57:37] <tasaif> no worries
[17:54:14] <subsonic> IS there a preferred js chart making framework?
[18:08:09] <Jckf> I'm encountering a weird problem with jQuery Mobile running under a PhoneGap application on Android 4.4. Some times when the app is opened, the pagecontainer changes the page to undefined, which leaves the user with a white screen. This does not appear to be caused by our own code, as we log to console every time we change the page, and nothing is logged besided the handler for pagecontainerchange saying it's changing to undefined.
[18:15:46] <Guest2296> Sometimes should never happen
[18:16:26] <Guest2296> Narrow it down to an always
[18:26:05] <Jckf> Guest2296, always after changing page to register, then closing a reopening the app
[18:26:27] <Jckf> *and
[18:26:58] <Guest2296> is there an error in the console?
[18:27:07] <Jckf> Nope. Only my log messages
[18:27:09] <Guest2296> does it happen when refreshing the page?
[18:27:29] <Jckf> Yes, doing window.location = 'index.html'; in the console also triggers it
[18:28:49] <Jckf> Even if I force stop the application and then reopen it, it'll happen. However, clearing the app's data and reopening it fixes the problem until I do the routine to trigger it again
[18:29:10] <Guest2296> maybe the problem is PhoneGap?
[18:29:28] <Jckf> How could PhoneGap trigger a page change event in jQuery Mobile?
[18:29:28] <Guest2296> Have you tested the app in a normal browser?
[18:29:37] <Jckf> Nothing about my app works in a browser
[18:30:02] <Guest2296> Can you give the parts of the app that require a device fake data?
[18:31:16] <Jckf> What is the simplest way to detect if I'm on a phone or not? I could simply skip the phone specific bits
[18:31:18] <Guest2296> that way you can elimate the possibility of the error existing underneath the browser
[18:31:29] <Guest2296> good question
[18:31:37] <Guest2296> maybe you can check the browser string?
[18:31:46] <Guest2296> there's probably a js library that does it for you
[18:32:04] <Jckf> Hm, or check for the existence of the cordova lib
[18:32:11] <Jckf> No cordova.js means no phone
[18:32:34] <Guest2296> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11381673/detecting-a-mobile-browser
[18:32:36] <Guest2296> take your pick
[18:33:51] <Guest2296> if the problem still exists, would you mind putting the version that runs in a browser in a repo and letting me fork it?
[18:34:16] <Guest2296> (removing sensitive data of course)
[18:35:51] <Jckf> That's going to be so much work :/
[18:36:08] <Guest2296> it's hard to help without being able to see the code :|
[18:36:21] <Guest2296> especially because i'm not a jquery mobile pro
[18:36:28] <Guest2296> maybe someone else here is more familiar
[18:36:49] <Guest2296> robertmax* is the next person I would ask
[18:36:54] <Guest2296> but it doesn't seem like he's here right now
[18:36:56] <Jckf> Yeah I understand how hard helping "blindly" is. I very much appreciate it though
[18:42:31] <Jckf> New info
[18:42:38] <Jckf> It's not trying to load undefined
[18:42:52] <Jckf> It's just unloading other pages, going back to the index page
[18:43:15] <Jckf> And my index just happened to have no ID. It does now.
[18:43:40] <Jckf> So something is triggering a history.back() or similar
[18:48:23] <Guest2296> weird
[18:48:45] <Guest2296> is this in the browser, or are you still debugging on phonegap?
[18:49:26] <Jckf> Still in PhoneGap. Set a break point in the page change event handler, and all points in the stack up until the handler itself are jquery
[18:49:29] <Jckf> Nothing external
[18:53:48] <Guest2296> Well, it's 7PM on a Friday
[18:53:50] <Guest2296> I'm going home
[18:54:08] <Guest2296> I wish you the best of luck hunting the bugs of yore
[18:54:56] <Guest2296> if you want to fork it later send to saif.tareq@gmail.com
[18:55:18] <Guest2296> also look for the user whose name begins with robertmax*
[18:55:23] <Guest2296> he may be able to assist
[18:55:28] <Guest2296> I don't know if he's online weekends
[18:55:36] <Jckf> Thank you, guy
[18:55:40] <Jckf> Have a nice weekend
[18:55:50] <Jckf> Too late :(

[19:51:49] <arc_> wow ...
[20:03:57] <tyy> #javascript sent me over here, I'm having some trouble getting .toggleClass to work on a dynamically generated div, could someone help me please? (:
[20:17:14] <Jckf> arc_, my brain
[20:20:19] <tyy> anyone here?
[20:22:01] <arc_> tyy jsfiddle or pastebin
[20:22:24] <fas3r> hello
[20:23:07] <fas3r> is it possible to execute a function only once from init: ?
[20:23:10] <tyy> https://jsfiddle.net/uqbh4y3m/92/embedded/result/ Here you go arc
[20:23:38] <arc_> what line of your code are we looking at
[20:23:39] <tyy> basically, I can't get the toggle class to fire to close the modal once opening the div
[20:24:07] <tyy> right at the top
[20:24:14] <tyy>    $(document).on('click', "a.btn", function (e) {            $(e.target).parents('.image-container').prev('.modal').toggleClass('modal--show');         });          $(document).on('click', '.overlay', function (e) {             $(e.target).prev('.modal').toggleClass('modal--show');         });          $(document).on('click', '.modal__close', function () {             ('.modal').toggleClass('modal--show');         });
[20:24:24] <tyy> oops, let me format that better
[20:25:03] <tyy> https://jsfiddle.net/uqbh4y3m/94/ You can see where I commented it out
[20:27:21] <arc_> change line 8 to use parent instead of prev
[20:27:34] <arc_> prev searches for siblings
[20:28:02] <arc_> div.modal is the parent element
[20:29:29] <tyy> Ah I see
[20:29:49] <tyy> the prev was from a colleague because it was having trouble pulling the correct text in
[20:30:18] <arc_> unless it matters that it's the directly preceding element, i would use find instead of prev
[20:30:22] <arc_> or next
[20:30:39] <arc_> like if you're just trying to select something that's unique on the page anyway
[20:30:40] <tyy> one last question, is there a way to make it so when you click `modal--close` to also close the div?
[20:31:05] <tyy> so say I was trying to select by an ID, you think find or next would be better?
[20:31:06] <arc_> where is that element on the page
[20:31:25] <arc_> sorry, i meant "find instead of prev or next" not "find or next instead of prev"
[20:32:04] <tyy> ah, my mistake, misunderstood!  and the .modal--close  appears in the .overlay when you enlarge an image, should be top right corner
[20:32:21] <arc_> hang on i have to open the result page
[20:32:45] <arc_> no, this is appearing off the page so i can't see it. what browser are you testing this in
[20:32:56] <tyy> sure thing, take your time
[20:33:35] <arc_> .modal__close doesn't seem to be appearing in chrome
[20:35:08] <arc_> you seem to have a div inside your anchor element
[20:35:30] <tyy> hmm, try this link: https://jsfiddle.net/uqbh4y3m/96/embedded/result/    click the imapal (second car in top row) you'll see it
[20:35:38] <tyy> impala*
[20:35:53] <arc_> font-awesome doesn't seem to be loading for me
[20:36:05] <tyy> oh, that'll do it! haha
[20:36:14] <arc_> i wonder why
[20:36:56] <arc_> well, line 13 should be working. problem is there's no $ at the beginning of the line
[20:37:09] <arc_> try fixing that and see if it works
[20:38:23] <tyy> no dice, sorry for the basic error.. I have this thing opened in a couple windows and lost track
[20:41:29] <arc_> something weird is going on here
[20:42:11] <tyy> what's up? here is the most updated version: https://jsfiddle.net/uqbh4y3m/100/
[20:42:24] <tyy> this has the close working when you click the overlay
[20:43:45] <arc_> ah, it's because you have given both the anchor and the inside div the class modal__close
[20:43:49] <arc_> so both of them are firing each time you click
[20:43:53] <arc_> therefore toggling it twice
[20:43:57] <arc_> and changing nothing
[20:44:47] <arc_> so remove modal__close class from the font-awesome div and it will work
[20:44:53] <tyy> ah, I see
[20:46:04] <tyy> I think that broke something haha
[20:46:07] <tyy> https://jsfiddle.net/uqbh4y3m/101/embedded/result/
[20:46:18] <tyy> open something and then close with the font-awesome icon
[20:46:52] <arc_> yeah. your selector
[20:47:14] <arc_> on line 13 use $($(this)).closest('.modal') instead of $('.modal')
[20:48:14] <arc_> i'm not entirely sure why that's happening but it's toggling multiple modals at once. it doesn't seem like there should even be more than one, but that's what's happening
[20:48:39] <tyy> well it generates x-amount based on the amount that are in my google docs
[20:48:53] <tyy> it's done off of a sheetrock.js / handlebars.js
[20:49:14] <arc_> it's not just loading the correct elements into one modal based on which image you clicked?
[20:49:46] <arc_> well, w/e. if you change it to be what i said it will work
[20:50:15] <tyy> I did and I can't thank you enough, i've been racking my brain for the past 5 hours and Stackoverflow wasn't much help
[20:50:29] <tyy> This was my last ditch effort haha
[20:50:29] <arc_> yeah.. it generally isn't
[20:52:37] <tyy> Everyone seems pretty pretentious over there, it's annoying. They also don't want anyone except their 'friend group' getting a ton of karma/upvotes lol
[20:56:34] <tyy> Well, I'm off to pack uo and get ready for a move. Thanks so much for the help arc_ !
[20:58:47] <arc_> np
[21:22:18] <fas3r> is it possible to call a function which is usually executed in the init  ? like instead doing myFunc.init() .. I would call the function   myFunc.TheFunc(). thanks bye advance.
[21:38:03] <acidjazz> fas3r: on tuesdays after about 6pm
[21:38:16] <fas3r> cool
[22:04:34] <jak2000> how to: if user click on back button say: leave the page? with 2 buttons: 1) stay on page or 2) leave the page  how to?
[22:07:26] <arc_> there's no back button click event. the browser automatically does that if you have filled some part of a form and didn't submit your changes before going back
[22:08:05] <arc_> i think, anyway
[22:08:37] <jak2000> arc_ is possible while user capture fields save into a cookie? if user by accident press backbutton, can recover the info captured?
[22:08:37] <arc_> in order to run some function when a user clicks back, you have to do some nonsense with hashes and use onhashchange
[22:09:16] <arc_> i'm sure that is possible
[22:10:32] <jak2000> arc_, if you access hotmail and start typing a email and you decide click back button you receive a message right?
[22:22:58] <jak2000> arc_?
