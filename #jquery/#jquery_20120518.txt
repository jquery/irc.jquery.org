[00:05:06] <IamTrying> How can i tell jQuery e.g: root.find('iframe').attr('src', 'www.google.com'); whileLoadingthisIFrame (please show something, normally 10 seconds it takes to load that);
[00:07:56] <IamTrying> it works: .attr ('src', function(i, v) { return 'www.google.com'; };
[00:09:02] <IamTrying> Not working
[00:09:17] <IamTrying> it works: .attr ('src', function(i, v) { how can i tell something starts/end ; return 'www.google.com'; };
[00:21:57] <IamTrying> But this is fake its not real/event listen: root.find('iframe').attr('src', function(i, val) {  Show("loading", "please wait...");   Timer(2500);    return 'www.google.com';  });
[00:22:20] <IamTrying> Is there no way i can really listen when its complete loading?
[00:23:25] <anli_> Is there a jquery function to read the contents of a querystring variable?
[00:24:58] <Yancy> bot?
[00:29:55] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: well you are correct e.preventDefault is working now.
[00:36:42] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: Thank you for spending time on this problem.  You are quite patient.
[00:36:57] <Back2Basics> I need to turn in it's 2:30
[00:46:25] <Whirl3d> np, goodnight
[00:46:37] <ravenzz> morning :]
[00:46:52] <Whirl3d> that too. 3:45 here.
[00:53:48] <Whirl3d> anli, sorry I missed you question earlier. Check out Ben Allman's Hash Decode methods...you'll have to google it.
[00:55:38] <Joshua_Lastdon> Hi. I created an a jquery SlideDown event but what I want to slide down already appears as soon as I load the page but I want it hidden when the user first visits the page. how do I go about that/
[00:55:49] <Joshua_Lastdon> *?
[00:56:03] <Whirl3d> set the element hidden in css
[00:56:18] <ravenzz> in js
[00:56:21] <ravenzz> you mean :p
[00:56:43] <Whirl3d> I mean in css. Then unset it in js when you want to show them
[00:56:53] <ravenzz> no buddy
[00:57:15] <Whirl3d> if you set it in js, you will get the dreaded flash of content
[00:57:23] <ravenzz> you won't see it if js is not running
[00:57:35] <ravenzz> working or whatever
[00:57:39] <Whirl3d> Then the slideDown won't work for you anyways
[00:57:42] <Whirl3d> so its moot
[00:57:50] <ravenzz> that could be painful
[00:58:10] <Whirl3d> if people aren't enabling js, then they are used to the paint
[00:58:13] <Whirl3d> *pain
[00:58:28] <ravenzz> say that you have an error in your js, the script will be broken and it won't work
[00:58:33] <jamesdotnet> maybe a css hover effect in addition to hiding, and you can remove it with js
[00:58:43] <ravenzz> you won't be able to see the element/use it
[00:59:02] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, lets say an airplane hit the user's house...they will never see it.
[00:59:30] <Whirl3d> I mean, one has to take for granted that the developer isn't going to publish broken codee.
[00:59:41] <Whirl3d> otherwise the number of possible variables becomes endless.
[00:59:57] <ravenzz> boh do whatever you want
[01:00:05] <ravenzz> that's not the way I like to do things
[01:00:27] <Whirl3d> Cool. Can we see some examples of your work? I'd love to see how you do things
[01:00:35] <Joshua_Lastdon> Thanks! I used display:none for my CSS and it was hidden but my Jquery event brought it out
[01:00:46] <ravenzz> progressive enhancement is important to me
[01:01:38] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[01:01:46] <globe_tmp> any good jquery soap client ?
[01:02:16] <ravenzz> Whirl3d I am not saying that I am better than you. The thing is..if you are aware of possible problems, why wouldn't you prevent them to occurs?
[01:05:51] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, though I respect your opinion (and I wasn't looking to compete), I was just stating that for the most part, folks in here are asking questions with the notion that js is enabled already
[01:06:04] <Whirl3d> otherwise, this would be something like #nojsjquery
[01:06:09] <Whirl3d> which doesn't really make a lot of sense
[01:06:32] <Whirl3d> if someone asks specifically how to accomodate browsers with js disabled, that's another question.
[01:06:58] <ravenzz> but basically they keep using the whole sstack html/css/js so the should be aware of best practices and stuffs
[01:07:28] <ravenzz> np anyway
[01:07:46] <ravenzz> it is not a problem of mine actually
[01:08:16] <Whirl3d> And to be honest, the biggest problem is that once you start trying to accommodate those special cases, you open up a whole can of worms that keeps the people from getting their project solved.
[01:08:54] <Whirl3d> And if the truth be known, I like to get the stuff done with my presumptions in tact and THEN go back to figure out how to accommodate special cases (like IE anything, for example)
[01:14:10] <ic_josh> I am trying to make a quora-type "add question request. I used a Jquery SlideDown event. Is that the best
[01:14:16] <ic_josh> way to go?
[01:15:23] <Whirl3d> do you have a link?
[01:16:01] <ic_josh> No, but it is a relatively short piece of code. I could post it here?
[01:16:17] <Whirl3d> post it to jsfiddle.net, please
[01:17:54] <ic_josh> I just did
[01:19:58] <Whirl3d> then click on share and copy the link. Post it here (make sure you save it first)
[01:21:32] <ic_josh> http://jsfiddle.net/DJ25J/
[01:22:48] <ic_josh> http://jsfiddle.net/DJ25J/1/
[01:23:27] <Whirl3d> ic_josh...here are a couple of things since you may not have ever used JSfiddle before:
[01:23:52] <ic_josh> ignore the first link
[01:24:02] <Whirl3d> You don't need anything but the body markup in the top left panel...no <body> tags, or <head> or <script> etc.
[01:24:11] <lucasw> Hi, does anyone have a example file if i want to load my suggestions from an external file? its for the jquery UI autocomplete. How should the javascript of the external file look like?
[01:24:19] <Whirl3d> All of your javacript code goes in the lower left hand corner
[01:24:22] <Xotix> if i have a plugin which attaches some logic to the change event of an element, how can i add additional logic to the same element on its change event which checks something and aboards (if the check failed) everything attached by additionals change() event?
[01:24:27] <Whirl3d> all of your CSS the upper right hand corner
[01:24:45] <Whirl3d> And from the panel at the left, select JQUERY , not mootools...
[01:25:02] <ic_josh> Got it. Thanks. The 2nd link is the correct one.
[01:25:02] <ColKurtz> Xotix
[01:25:21] <Xotix> ColKurtz:
[01:25:28] <Whirl3d> ic_josh, great. I'm checking it out now
[01:27:08] <ColKurtz> Xotix http://pastie.org/3929397
[01:27:16] <ColKurtz> does that help?
[01:27:49] <Whirl3d> ic_josh, you might want to consider using .toggle  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/DJ25J/2/
[01:28:00] <Xotix> that's so simple that i didn't think about it. probably nothing wrong about it. hm thanks
[01:28:12] <ColKurtz> cool np
[01:28:13] <Xotix> ColKurtz:
[01:29:06] <Whirl3d> ic_josh, it might not work with your design, but I just wanted to show you another way to approach it.
[01:29:44] <kbotnen> Hi, How would I go on strong a list of select option in a variable and restore it at a later time? Ive tried data(), clone, and just variabelName = $selector.
[01:30:25] <ColKurtz> What's that kbotnen ?
[01:30:34] <ic_josh> Whirl3d: okay. Yes, I didn't really come out well. But please check out quora.com and the add question button at the top. That's what I am trying to do. Do you know the perfect way to achieve that/
[01:30:39] <ic_josh> *?
[01:30:58] <Whirl3d> Let me look at quora.com...
[01:32:01] <Xotix> kbotnet later time? different script, domain, 1month later? same script?
[01:34:49] <kbotnen> it goes as this: page load, I save select list, attach a handler onSelect, onSelect does modify the select list. It theres another onSelect I want to reload the select list from "clean" copy.
[01:35:01] <Whirl3d> ic_josh, though I am not sure, I thnk they may be using jqueryUI's tabbed panel interface with the initial panel collapsed
[01:35:14] <kbotnen> so later time is same page, but on succeeding events, like onSelect.
[01:37:42] <ic_josh> Whirl3d: I'm sorry I am quite new to Jquery. Can you point me to a link with some form of documentation on Jquery's tabbed panel interface?
[01:38:19] <Whirl3d> Let's see if bot-t can help...

[01:57:36] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by dmethvin (1m, 1w ago): Fix #8653, .param() undefined/null values become empty strings
[02:18:14] <emilsedgh> im a bit confused... i need client side templating, what plugi should i use?
[02:18:39] <emilsedgh> plugin*
[02:18:59] <Dodfr> back with my weird javascript problem and finally I found that if I do a .getSCript that contain a .dialog() setup then if I change for exemple de title inside .dialog() definition then the title will not change (whenever new verison of javascript has been loaded) un less I do the .dialog() definition twice one after other !
[02:21:41] <recentlydeceased> hey peeps, experiencing a weird issue, this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/rbP8Q/3/ gives an example of the code used, though it doesn't highlight the issue - it works perfectly.  The problem I'm having is that the toggle is jerky and the search button doesn't slide it just appears in it's final slid down location.  Also, it randomly toggles straight back up on a macbook air test machine.  The actual page is a jquery modal where this takes place.  Any
[02:21:41] <recentlydeceased>  ideas?
[02:30:06] <Whirl3d> don't use .live?
[02:30:20] <Whirl3d> try using .on instead.
[02:31:12] <Whirl3d> .live attaches the event handler to the dom whereas .on can be more specific and less likely to bog down.
[02:33:09] <Whirl3d> btw, for me the search button appears with the postcode rather than just appearing.
[02:33:34] <tbharath> can anyone please help me out with animate() function
[02:33:48] <Whirl3d> And perhaps you should consider css3 transforms and transitions to enable hardware acceleration for your animations.
[02:34:03] <Whirl3d> tbharath, what is your question?
[02:35:35] <tbharath> Whirl3d: in the https://github.com/unique1D/UID , I have a div element  and I want to animate the div element with id="web" ,but it not functioning as I want
[02:37:54] <Whirl3d> tbharath, if you could setup a working example by pasting your code into jsfiddle.net and sharing the url here, It would be easier to troubleshoot with you
[02:38:15] <tbharath> Whirl3d: ok
[02:40:16] <recentlydeceased> Whirl3d, cheers, turns out I had absolute positioning set on the button @.@
[02:41:52] <Whirl3d> i hate css. LOL still you should look up .on ---it's a lot better than .live and .live is being deprecated.
[02:43:18] <tbharath> Whirl3d: I can't get the same output in jsfiddle
[02:44:02] <Whirl3d> that's usually a good place to start..
[02:44:18] <Whirl3d> turn of normalize CSS on the left panel?
[02:45:08] <Zhy> Is it possible to do something like $('#divthatcontainstheform form').submit() ?
[02:45:57] <Whirl3d> there is not likely a submit event for the div. What are you really trying to do?
[02:47:16] <Azra-el> hey guys.. anybody using latest version of jqtouch that comes with compass theming?
[02:49:16] <Zhy> Whirl3d well in general I need a submit button above my form. The  thing is, as far as I can tell, I need to put the button markup inside the form tags, now with absolute positioning it's possible to put the button on top but it's supposed to be inside a toolbar, so absolute positioning is not really an option. I thought maybe I could put a "placeholder" button in the toolbar via which to call
[02:49:17] <Zhy> a javascript function (or click event on the button) in which th  form is submitted
[02:49:59] <tbharath> Whirl3d: but  I am getting different output when I tried in my local computer  , let me show you the image
[02:49:59] <Zhy> and document.form["formID"].submit() (that's what I found should be possible) is not really an option since there are quite a few forms in my application with different ids
[02:50:01] <Whirl3d> trigger
[02:50:32] <Whirl3d> give your form an ID and $("#formid").trigger("submit");
[02:50:46] <tbharath> http://imagebin.org/212826 , http://imagebin.org/212827, this is my output
[02:51:40] <Zhy> hmmm I will try that, thanks, gotta extract the form id dynamically but that shouldn't be a problem
[02:51:44] <Whirl3d> tbharath, and what is the issue?
[02:52:49] <Whirl3d> Zhy, you should be able to create a button (or an anchor element with an href attribute that indicates the form id) and submit that way
[02:53:22] <tbharath> Whirl3d: when I press login the login window will appear and at the same time the div element with white background should also move to the left
[02:53:25] <recentlydeceased> Whirl3d, yeah, thanks I'll take a look!
[02:54:08] <Whirl3d> tbharath, that sounds like a css issue to me.
[02:54:47] <tbharath> Whirl3d: I mean using animate()
[02:55:11] <Whirl3d> The thing is that without the correct CSS, you aren't going to get it to work.
[02:55:27] <angelazou> I'm getting the $ and jQuery is not defined error
[02:55:28] <angelazou> what's the cause of such an error?
[02:55:38] <Whirl3d> You could try applying step-based callbacks to maually reposition the main div
[02:55:55] <angelazou> i have a jquery script right in the same directory
[02:56:00] <Whirl3d> angelazou, jquery isn't loading
[02:56:36] <angelazou> okay, but what can be the causes? Whirl3d
[02:56:41] <tbharath> Whirl3d: can you please check it out in http://jsfiddle.net/bKPnP/4/
[03:04:20] <Whirl3d> tbharath, gimme a minute to write some notes for you
[03:07:45] <Azra-el> anybody using the latest jqtouch? if so ... anybody had any issues with compiling the scss with compass??
[03:27:04] <Funkt> Hi there I have an html page where I am displaying several jquery scripts I am getting very weird errors with div's not showing how they should be styled if that makes sense has anyone come across this?
[03:28:01] <dezzz> Hi
[03:28:19] <dezzz> I'm having trouble using .remove() on a form that has dynamic content
[03:28:31] <NodeX> Funkt : perhaps a link to the page owuld help
[03:28:41] <NodeX> dezzz : please be more specific
[03:29:01] <Funkt> Yes of course it's all done locally
[03:29:16] <Funkt> :(
[03:29:39] <dezzz> well I have declared some html in a variable. I use jquery ui dialog on it. and then I have soom loops that make the text inputs
[03:29:45] <dezzz> it's to input a matrix
[03:30:13] <dezzz> but in the .on('submit', function(e) {   $(this).remove()});
[03:30:17] <NodeX> Funkt : not sure what help we can be then
[03:30:31] <dezzz> problem is the next time you open the dialog, it will have the previous text inputs
[03:30:40] <Funkt> No that's what I thought but thanks anyhow all the same!
[03:30:50] <NodeX> dezzz : that's probably a caching issue
[03:31:00] <dezzz> oh
[03:31:48] <NodeX> I am not familier with jquery ui dialogue but I'm assuming your loading the dynamic content via ajax get ?
[03:33:09] <dezzz> i'm getting the values of a previous form with $("#inputid").val()
[03:33:21] <dezzz> here's the code if you want to look http://pastebin.com/226dXEKx
[03:34:03] <dezzz> line 40
[03:34:48] <NodeX> and this happens after page refresh /.
[03:34:49] <NodeX> ?
[03:35:29] <dezzz>  no when you finish with the matrice
[03:35:39] <dezzz> if you click the button again and restart the process
[03:36:27] <NodeX> these inputs ... "<input id="matricesubmit" name="matricesubmit" value="input" type="submit" />" ?
[03:36:57] <dezzz> no the previous currentinput
[03:37:07] <dezzz> line 66
[03:38:05] <NodeX> wehat happens when you explicitly give it a value
[03:38:34] <NodeX> what*
[03:38:46] <Jax> can i check if an element is toggled or not?
[03:38:51] <Jax> i.e if toggle() is applied or not
[03:38:57] <NodeX> is(":visible") iirc
[03:39:20] <NodeX> if($(foo).is(":visible")) { ...
[03:39:50] <Jax> i'll try that, thanks
[03:40:34] <Jax> and is not visible?
[03:40:37] <Jax> sorry, js is a bit rusty
[03:40:52] <Jax> if(!f$(foo).is(":visible")) { i guess?
[03:41:05] <jorick> Hi all, I'm trying to debug a problem with draggables and sortables. the problem only manifests on chrome: when i move the draggables around they don't appear nicely under mouse pointer like I'd expect (and firefox does), instead they appear to be placed in a static position underneath the placeholders. does anyone know what could cause this?
[03:42:06] <NodeX> if(!$(foo).is("visible")) {
[03:45:57] <dezzz> NodeX> I put it online here http://94.23.154.145/
[03:46:26] <dezzz> if you click the open file button you get the matrix dialog that asks you to specify the dimensions
[03:46:32] <Jax> you sure it is is("visible") ?
[03:46:54] <dezzz> the you get the matrix dialog that  asks you to specify the values
[03:47:03] <Jax> ah :
[03:47:19] <dezzz> if you repeat the process you get the previous inputs with the values, and so the matrix dimensions are not respected
[03:48:25] <NodeX> right I see now
[03:48:35] <NodeX> It's not destroying the dialogue
[03:48:48] <dezzz> and i verified the html is being removed ok
[03:49:03] <dezzz> it just comes back the next time I access #matriceTable
[03:49:18] <NodeX> the dialogue is not bound to $(this)
[03:49:19] <NodeX> $(this).dialog('destroy');
[03:49:28] <NodeX> $(this) in that context is the form
[03:50:17] <dezzz> i changed it to $(matriceinput).dialog('destroy'); to the same effect
[03:50:27] <dezzz> but it is being destroyed because the form goes away
[03:50:38] <NodeX> you're binding a submit to a dov not a form
[03:50:40] <dezzz> the $(this) is inside  $(matricecreation).on('submit', function (e) {
[03:50:49] <NodeX> div *
[03:51:02] <dezzz> ah yeah
[03:51:35] <NodeX> you probably want ... $(matriceinput).find('form')
[03:51:45] <NodeX> $(matriceinput).find('form').on....
[03:52:20] <NodeX> but be careful because $(this) will not be the form
[03:52:48] <dezzz> ?
[03:53:12] <NodeX> you're trying to bind a dialog to a form
[03:53:22] <NodeX> make sure you can do that and it doesn't expect a div
[03:53:38] <NodeX> I don't use jquery UI so I am not sure what it expects
[03:53:54] <dezzz> yeah I think I got it will try out a few things. Thanks!
[03:54:43] <NodeX> ;)
[03:56:12] <vladyn> hello guys can I ask a simple question - how can I empty an html element from his contents ?
[03:56:35] <quicksilver> ?empty @ vladyn
[03:56:42] <bot-t> vladyn, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[03:57:08] <vladyn> ...and then to app new content ?
[03:57:25] <vladyn> empty off course many thanks !
[03:57:57] <vladyn> add new content ? just asking as I'm more familiar with mootools - .adopt() was there
[03:59:20] <quicksilver> vladyn: take a browse over the API docs, there are lots of ways.
[03:59:23] <Jax> how can i show a loader when using load()
[03:59:24] <quicksilver> insert, append, etc.
[03:59:48] <vladyn> I will - load seems to do the job
[03:59:55] <vladyn> many thanks once again
[04:02:49] <quicksilver> vladyn: load is different from insert and append, it's for asynchronous loading via ajax
[04:03:00] <vladyn> yeah I just reading
[04:03:07] <vladyn> it's loading html content
[04:03:31] <vladyn> im my case I want to change an YTube iframe src to switch another video
[04:04:12] <vladyn> appendTo is what I need
[04:07:48] <quicksilver> vladyn: I don't think so
[04:07:57] <quicksilver> vladyn: if it's an iframe you just want to change the src?
[04:08:10] <quicksilver> $('blah').attr('src','new src...')
[04:08:22] <vladyn> I've tries
[04:08:24] <vladyn> tried
[04:08:26] <vladyn> but
[04:08:26] <vladyn> hmm
[04:08:33] <vladyn> that was the first thing
[04:09:05] <Jax> is it correct to use "this" when passing an element to a function, as in: <tr onclick="myfunction(this, 'myurlâ€¦')" to a function myfunction(element, url) { â€¦ }
[04:10:24] <vladyn> it actually - when I create a new element 'frame' (two new elements with the whole embed code from youtube) and appending them to some div - it works
[04:10:35] <ravenzz> Jax don't use inline code
[04:11:00] <Jax> i'm using inline so i can generate the correct urls
[04:11:12] <Jax> you think it is better to add the 'id' i need to the element and extract it?
[04:11:27] <Azra-el> anybody using the latest jqtouch by any chance ?
[04:11:52] <ravenzz> Jax I don't know what you are trying to do
[04:12:19] <Jax> ravenzz: i just have a table of orders, each order has an id. when i click a row (which represents an order) i want to load the details in a row under that order
[04:13:02] <Jax> so basically just: $('thattr').click(function(){ $(this).next('tr').toggle() and $(this).next('tr').load(url_to_order_details)
[04:13:17] <Jax> so i need the order id for the url_to_order_details of course
[04:14:14] <ravenzz> <tr><td>data</td></tr>   <tr><td><a href="whatever">Details</a></td></tr>
[04:14:31] <Jax> yes
[04:14:38] <Jax> that's what i'll have in the end. just testing on the row for now
[04:15:03] <ravenzz> you click on data, get the url from the next row, load the content e replace the Details link
[04:15:05] <ravenzz> ?
[04:15:32] <Jax> ah i see
[04:15:34] <Jax> very clever
[04:15:34] <Jax> <3
[04:15:36] <ravenzz> provide the user with the link that point to the details
[04:15:39] <ravenzz> anyway
[04:15:45] <Jax> of course in case js doesn't work
[04:15:46] <ravenzz> you can easily hide it
[04:15:57] <Jax> actually, i'll just add it to the parent row
[04:16:12] <ravenzz> yep, if you don't want to do that... then you should show me your markup at least
[04:16:43] <ravenzz> but I think that i suggested to you to have nested tables yesterday
[04:17:32] <Jax> that's what i'm doing
[04:17:50] <ravenzz> eh ok
[04:19:38] <Jax> how do you block the link so it can't be clicked in case js works?
[04:20:22] <ravenzz> ?preventDefautl
[04:20:24] <bot-t> ravenzz, event.preventDefault() - If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[04:20:55] <Jax> awesome. thanks
[04:21:02] <ravenzz> yw
[04:22:34] <Jax> properties are just accessible as elem.href, correct?
[04:23:08] <ravenzz> where?
[04:23:27] <ravenzz> if it is a jQuery object you should use the attr() method
[04:23:53] <ravenzz> like $('a').click(function(){ console.log($(this).attr('href')) })
[04:24:01] <Jax> if i do something like: <a class="collapse-link" href="myurl"â€¦> then $('a.collapse-link').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); $(this).next('tr').load(this.href) ...
[04:24:58] <ravenzz> you could append a new row
[04:25:15] <ravenzz> with the content
[04:25:21] <Jax> what is the advantage
[04:25:32] <Jax> nicer markup i guess
[04:25:55] <Jax> ok so i would append to the row where the <a> is contained in
[04:27:23] <ravenzz> but it is very hard to me to give you suggestions without  having had a look at your code
[04:27:38] <Jax> of course. one second, i'll get the bits together.
[04:27:44] <ravenzz> ok
[04:27:45] <Jax> how can i select the surrounding tr ?
[04:27:52] <Jax> <tr> <td><a ...
[04:28:24] <ravenzz> depends on "where you are"
[04:28:52] <ravenzz> are you willing to select the TR from the click callback?
[04:28:59] <Jax> yes
[04:29:18] <ravenzz> so you can use the closest() selector or the parent one
[04:29:22] <Jax> well i want to select the <tr> where the "Details" link is contained. basically just the parent element
[04:29:32] <ravenzz> $(this).closest('tr') or $(this).parent().parent()
[04:29:50] <Jax> and appendTo works with load() ?
[04:31:18] <Jax> $(this).closest('tr').append($('<tr>').load(myurl)) i guess
[04:31:31] <ravenzz> you cannot append a tr to a tr
[04:31:50] <ravenzz> $(this).closest('tr').after($('<tr/>').load(yoururl)) i guess
[04:32:12] <Jax> will give it a shot
[04:32:24] <ravenzz> supposing that your script return a bunch of tds
[04:32:51] <Jax> it returns a new row with a td with full colspan, and the nested table
[04:33:01] <Jax> <tr><td colspan="5"> <table with details ...
[04:34:41] <ravenzz> so use $.get() instead
[04:37:02] <Jax> ok, seems to work now
[04:37:08] <Jax> probably pretty ugly though
[04:37:11] <Jax> one sec
[04:39:39] <Jax> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/Z2VT5/
[04:43:34] <Jax> guess it made your eyes bleed
[04:43:34] <Jax> ;)
[04:43:35] <ravenzz> so what are you getting back ?
[04:43:44] <Jax> well it works
[04:43:46] <ravenzz> an entire new table?
[04:43:58] <ravenzz> or just a row
[04:44:09] <Jax> ah yes, sorry. an entire table with the surrounding <td> of that empty row
[04:44:37] <Jax> the url returns: <td colspan="X"> <table> with order details â€¦â€¦ lots of row and tdsâ€¦ </table> </td>
[04:45:07] <ravenzz> ok
[04:45:14] <Jax> so it just add that's <td colspan="X">â€¦ of the script in to the <tr class="hide"> HERE </tr>
[04:45:35] <Jax> makes sense?
[04:45:46] <ravenzz> it does
[04:46:35] <Jax> is it possible to do without the <tr clas="hide"> ?
[04:46:42] <Jax> with the append approach
[04:47:13] <ravenzz> but cannot you do this http://jsfiddle.net/Z2VT5/3/
[04:47:20] <ravenzz> ?
[04:47:27] <smykes> Does anyone have a recomendation for a popup besides twitter's bootstrap?
[04:47:59] <Jax> ravenzz: i could, but then you can't close it again when you click details
[04:48:20] <ravenzz> why not?
[04:48:36] <ravenzz> hold on
[04:48:38] <Jax> well, toggle needs to be in there, doesn't it
[04:48:44] <Jax> and what about clicking details twice
[04:48:55] <Jax> gotta try
[04:51:34] <Jax> it does work ravenzz but if you click details twice, it'll append more rows obviously
[04:52:23] <Jax> could do the same with remove though
[04:52:25] <Jax> might be nicer
[04:52:51] <Jax> but then you'll have to somehow detect if the next row is an order row, or a details row
[04:54:06] <ravenzz> one sec
[04:54:26] <Jax> sure, take your time if you have any
[04:57:54] <smykes> ugh qtip2 doesnt have a stable build
[05:00:44] <ravenzz> Jax try this with real data http://jsfiddle.net/Z2VT5/6/
[05:02:11] <jianmeng> is  jquery support touch event?
[05:03:01] <Jax> that works ravenzz
[05:03:05] <smykes> i think jquery mobile does jianmeng
[05:04:51] <ravenzz> Jax yep
[05:04:55] <Jax> though the slidetoggle doesn't work, it just pops open. but that's normal i guess
[05:05:14] <ravenzz> eh yes
[05:05:41] <Jax> i'm not sure yet if i don't want it to reload
[05:05:42] <ravenzz> anyway I would use $.get() and add the new row only on success
[05:05:50] <Jax> because it could be that others are working on something and the updates should be here when they open it
[05:06:05] <Jax> but this is a good appraoch
[05:06:13] <Jax> thanks a million
[05:06:17] <ravenzz> yw
[05:06:27] <Jax> hm, one concern: does the jquery stuff i applied also apply to the stuff loaded with load() ?
[05:06:32] <ravenzz> as I said, try to redo that using $.get
[05:06:59] <Jax> say i have more links inside the stuff i load with class="collapse-link"
[05:10:45] <Jax> hm seems not, gah
[05:11:11] <Jax> is it really true, that jquery in the main file does not apply to dynamically loaded content?
[05:11:28] <Jax> i guess jquery is only initialized once when the file is loaded the first time
[05:20:13] <Xploderman90> hi! someone knows how to disable scrollbars leaving the scrolling with the mouse wheel?
[05:20:33] <Jax> for anyone with same issue: check out live()
[05:21:26] <quicksilver> Jax: no, don't do taht.
[05:21:30] <quicksilver> Jax: live is deprecated.
[05:21:59] <Xploderman90> delegate is better i think
[05:22:02] <quicksilver> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[05:22:17] <quicksilver> although, haha, the faq answer is out of date.
[05:22:20] <quicksilver> Just use 'on'
[05:22:28] <quicksilver> ?on @ Jax
[05:22:28] <bot-t> Jax, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:22:43] <Jax> thx, checking
[05:24:08] <Xploderman90> quicksilver, do you know how to hide scrollbars and have anyway the mouse wheel scroll effect?
[05:28:18] <smykes> Does anyone have any experience with Twitter's Bootstrap
[05:34:21] <Jax> quicksilver, is there a problem doing: $('body').on('click', 'a.detail-collapse-link', function ...
[05:34:36] <Jax> should the first element be as close as possible to the newly inserted element
[05:35:24] <Jax> btw, do you still have to use type="text/javascript" in html5 ?
[05:35:29] <Jax> for your scripts
[05:35:43] <ravenzz> you don't
[05:36:26] <quicksilver> Jax: not really, no. The code only gets run once per click
[05:36:36] <quicksilver> so it's perfectly sane to have it on 'body'
[05:36:47] <Jax> why isn't that the default for .on then?
[05:36:53] <Jax> then it would work with later inserted elements as well
[05:37:14] <quicksilver> because it's not always what you want for a variety of reasons
[05:37:20] <Jax> ok ;)
[05:37:23] <quicksilver> sometimes you need to trap in parent elements on child elements or in a particular place
[05:37:29] <quicksilver> or allow default behaviour
[05:37:35] <quicksilver> or do things in a certain order
[05:37:46] <quicksilver> and with an event like mousemove, which is called every time the mouse moves 1 pixel
[05:37:52] <quicksilver> you might not want over-large delegations
[05:38:03] <Jax> true
[05:38:05] <ravenzz> you can use this btw
[05:38:10] <ravenzz> ?newContent
[05:38:10] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[05:53:02] <joshauh> hello, excuse my ignorance, but if someone could please point me into the right direction, please. I am looking at making a form which saves the data to a MYSQL database, but one of the topics is "Service:" and this could potentially have 3-10 different lines of text, I would like to dynamically populate these lines by simply clicking "+Add new line", and at the end of it, the processing form
[05:53:02] <joshauh> should understand that there was "x" lines created... is that possible?
[05:54:57] <walidvb> hi guyys, i'm going crazy here... apparently i must have bound an event to a div, but i really can't find where, at all! I don't know the debugger too well, how can I check where a function is called?
[05:55:43] <angelazou> Hi this is my first ajax attempt using jquery and I've run into quite a few troubles.
[05:55:47] <angelazou> I have a paste here http://pastie.org/3930386
[05:55:57] <angelazou> it contains the 3 parts of script from different files
[05:56:21] <angelazou> in the html, I have a form and a button tag that's suppose to trigger the jquery function when clicked
[05:57:41] <donnaR> how can make a form submit without refreshing ?
[05:58:01] <Hooloovoo> donnaR: you can't
[05:58:16] <nail__> walidvb: set a breakpoint in your function, once you'll hit it you can see the call stack (chrome)
[05:58:49] <donnaR> Hooloovoo, ? aint that what is ajax used for?
[05:58:50] <Hooloovoo> donnaR: or i guess you could set the action="#", maybe that'll work.
[05:58:53] <Logikos_> donnaR: this is probably what you want: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:58:57] <walidvb> nail__: yes, sorry, i just did this actually. only to notice that when I click on a link, it triggers the event twice...?
[05:59:05] <Hooloovoo> donnaR: well yes but then you're not submitting the form
[05:59:38] <donnaR> Hooloovoo, ok so how do i 'post' a form without refreshing?
[06:00:09] <Hooloovoo> donnaR: Logikos_ sent you a link, have a look at that =)
[06:00:23] <walidvb> link is here, but u need to click on the tab, then on the 'cook', then compose a meal. you will then be able to confirm, but when you click confirm it is as if you clicked twice
[06:00:26] <walidvb> file:///Users/Gaston/Dropbox/School/Master/Master2/PIS/SugarBalance/web/sb2/index.html
[06:00:43] <walidvb> errr.... oops
[06:01:16] <walidvb> http://vbbros.net/sb/index.html
[06:01:47] <donnaR> Hooloovoo, is there any way getting around manually creating the headers?
[06:05:39] <nail__> walidvb: is that the right page? I'm not sure which tab you mean, there's some dino blinking at me with lunch/phone/puzzle buttons
[06:06:01] <walidvb> nail__: yes, sorry, i had some issue with my app that syncs to server, should stop using it... :/
[06:06:04] <walidvb> now it should be ok
[06:06:30] <nail__> still the same :)
[06:06:36] <walidvb> there should be a tab 'header' at the bottom, if you click on it 4 icons come up. top left is a cook
[06:06:37] <walidvb> hm
[06:07:34] <walidvb> nail__: ps: it's meant for mobile, as a prototype, so i looks like s*** on big windows, but that's not my point
[06:07:39] <nail__> walidvb: that's what I get http://i.imm.io/pGvK.png
[06:07:45] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/HDGM8/ this snippet has a little issue with the hover. It's suppose to show 2 more links when hovering over the second name
[06:07:55] <walidvb> ok, that's cause of the reso. anyways, click on the cloud
[06:08:12] <angelazou> I'm following the example from the documentation
[06:08:13] <walidvb> (which is a cook's hat, btw ^^)
[06:08:24] <angelazou> but it seems to not work very well
[06:08:50] <angelazou> but I'm pretty sure it's not that the div can't be hovered, right?
[06:08:57] <angelazou> so any ideas?
[06:09:56] <walidvb> nail__: then you can add items(the big ugly buttons), and a 'confirm' button will appear. that is the one that is weird.
[06:11:00] <angelazou> btw, how do you access the POST variables passed by ajax?
[06:11:10] <angelazou> the docs said it's passed as an object
[06:11:36] <walidvb> angelazou: feed-meta has size 0
[06:11:37] <angelazou> so does that mean I can't use the $_POST['var'] to access it?
[06:12:05] <walidvb> angelazou: so you can't hover it
[06:12:21] <angelazou> walidvb: do you mean that it should have content inside the div?
[06:12:32] <walidvb> either this, or set a height
[06:12:37] <walidvb> height is 0 ftm
[06:13:20] <angelazou> I see
[06:13:42] <angelazou> but I also noticed the unhovering actions are not removing the links
[06:14:32] <Dodfr> angelazou: $_POST as for any standard posted variable
[06:15:08] <Dodfr> angelazou: so if you post "var1" then you'll get it with $_POST['var1']
[06:15:19] <angelazou> well, I had some difficult time getting it. what kind of methods can I use to echo it or var_dump it?
[06:15:39] <angelazou> i mean anything special? cuz if I can't var_dump it, I don't know where it went wrong
[06:15:56] <angelazou> kind of why I think javascript is hard, cuz you'd rely only on the console to tell you what's wrong
[06:16:05] <Dodfr> angelazou: did you serialize it before sending ?
[06:16:55] <Hooloovoo> donnaR: there are plugins, but they're quite messy imho
[06:16:57] <varnie> Hi there.
[06:17:15] <angelazou> Dodfr: here is a paste http://pastie.org/3930386
[06:17:20] <varnie> is it possible to take selector for class ".foo" but not for ".foo bar"?
[06:17:20] <Dodfr> angelazou: if it's a form then $.post("sendForm.ajax.php", $("#formData").serialize(),function(data){...}
[06:17:32] <varnie> not for ".foo .bar"
[06:17:35] <Hooloovoo> varnie: check out .not()
[06:17:55] <Hooloovoo> varnie: or :not(), samt thing
[06:18:27] <walidvb_> nail__: any clue?
[06:18:42] <angelazou> Dodfr: well, it is a form, but I have return false on when the button is clicked, should I still use that?
[06:19:08] <angelazou> btw, can I use this keyword when trying to select its children like this > .classname?
[06:19:45] <Dodfr> angelazou: try my sample the serialize form first and use .get instead of .load
[06:20:33] <angelazou> okay, but there is also a input file field
[06:20:59] <Dodfr> angelazou: so ? serialize will keep care of all
[06:21:53] <Dodfr> angelazou: oups.. I said use .get, but of course it's .post as in sample
[06:22:02] <angelazou> okay
[06:22:10] <nail__> walidvb_: your pageinit handler gets called multiple times
[06:22:21] <walidvb_> hehe i was correcting that atm
[06:22:25] <nail__> but I don't know much about jquery mobile, that's about all I can say
[06:22:37] <walidvb_> but i don't really see how this is meant to be done, though.
[06:22:49] <walidvb_> never mind, need something fast and dirty, it'll do
[06:22:58] <walidvb_> (plz don't look at the rest of my code :/ ;))
[06:23:16] <varnie> and if I have it written as "$('body').on('click', '.foo', function(){...}); will it be possible to add that :not filter there?
[06:24:13] <Dodfr> but for now I am still stuck with my .dialog() declaration not refreshed when reloaded from an external .js but if I double declare it in the .js then the second one finally make the .dialog() definition change ?!?
[06:25:01] <walidvb_> nail__: that was it
[06:25:03] <walidvb_> thanks!
[06:26:06] <nail__> welcome =)
[06:27:10] <angelazou> I had to make a change to the snippet because I realized that I wanted to append to the children of the div
[06:27:25] <angelazou> I updated the script here http://jsfiddle.net/HDGM8/2/
[06:28:22] <angelazou> seems like it's no longer appending
[06:28:36] <angelazou> even though both the selected element and its children have height
[06:30:05] <angelazou> thoughts please?
[06:33:51] <Keir_> Is there a way to change the get request that autocomplete makes?
[06:34:00] <Keir_> so it sends something other than 'term'?
[06:37:01] <angelazou> I had to make a change to the snippet because I realized that I wanted to append to the children of the div
[06:37:09] <angelazou>  seems like it's no longer appending
[06:37:13] <angelazou> even though both the selected element and its children have height
[06:37:15] <angelazou> thoughts please?
[06:37:24] <Dodfr> angelazou: but in your sample, .feed-user has no sibling so it never go into to .append
[06:38:24] <angelazou> it's the feed-meta I'm after, .feed-user is a sibling to .feed-meta Dodf
[06:39:08] <angelazou> Dodfr and .feed-pic is the child of .feed-meta and that's where I want to append and delete
[06:39:28] <Christer_> Is there any way to make a ajax call wait until the loading document is ready before it throws success? i got a sleep(5) inside the loading page and it doesnt get loaded.
[06:40:42] <VictorCl> how can with jquery take a link and send it as it was a button from a form?
[06:40:46] <VictorCl> hi :D
[06:42:02] <Dodfr> VictorCl:  ??? post the form ?
[06:42:10] <Christer_> what do you meen VictorCl ? That when a users clicks on it and it acts like a submit button or do you want to send it in an e-mail or something?
[06:42:32] <Dodfr> angelazou: so you want to add a "add/delete" after "some content Today" ?
[06:43:31] <Keir_> Does anyone know if there is a way to change the get request of UI autocomplete so it's not 'term' I am trying to use 2 autocompletes on different pages but would like the same php to handle both requests, so checking the get request isset
[06:44:24] <johnkpaul> Keir_: you can override the "source" option I believe
[06:44:33] <angelazou> Dodfr: just after Today in fact
[06:45:42] <johnkpaul> Keir_: view the source of this http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[06:47:46] <ezio> what's the proper way to pass a custom variable into a call back?
[06:47:57] <ezio> what's the proper way to pass a custom variable into a call back?
[06:48:09] <Keir_> johnkpaul: thanks, that looks like what i was after, sorry for being lazy!!
[06:48:24] <johnkpaul> Keir_: :) no problem
[06:49:16] <johnkpaul> ezio: in javascript, you can use variables that are defined previously inside the scope of  anewly defined function

[06:51:02] <Christer_> Is there any way to make a ajax call wait until the loading document is ready before it throws success? i got a sleep(5) inside the loading page and it doesnt get loaded.
[06:51:45] <johnkpaul> Christer_: you could make the ajax call inside document.ready
[06:51:53] <ezio> function(context){ $(.host_widget_input').autocomplete({source:function(request,respons){ context.addClass ...
[06:52:01] <ezio> johnkpaul, ^ ?
[06:52:08] <johnkpaul> Christer_: or, you could add a new function to $(document).ready() in your success callback

[06:52:52] <Christer_> johnkpaul: What do you mean ? If the script doesnt sit around and wait for the external sleep() to finish then there is nothing to get back..
[06:53:05] <ezio> johnkpaul, that was just a sample to talk about scope ...
[06:53:28] <johnkpaul> ezio: :) well it wasn't self explanatory
[06:53:47] <ezio> johnkpaul, is that how i pass context down to that call back?
[06:54:01] <johnkpaul> Christer_: I don't think I understand what you're trying to do. You're making an ajax call before the dom is ready, and you want the callback to fire only _after_ the dom is ready
[06:54:07] <johnkpaul> ?tias @ ezio
[06:54:07] <bot-t> ezio, Try It And See
[06:55:17] <Christer_> johnkpaul: No, i got a ajax call that starts on the click event for a link. It requests another script to run before it reloads the page.
[06:55:58] <Christer_> but the ajax request doesnt sit around and wait for ther other script to finish loading before its comes back to me.
[06:57:05] <johnkpaul> Christer_: when you say "the other script"
[06:57:10] <johnkpaul> you mean some backend service
[06:57:11] <johnkpaul> ?
[06:57:54] <Christer_> i mean the page that the ajax script requests.
[06:58:28] <johnkpaul> hm, so Christer_, why is that page "coming back to you" before it has finished loading
[06:58:28] <johnkpaul> ?
[06:59:38] <Christer_> That is what i am wondering about asweel.. The ajax requests throws the "success:" right after it starts, and the sleep() inside the other script is for 10 seconds.
[06:59:57] <Christer_> so i would think it would wait those 10 seconds before it did "come back"
[07:01:29] <johnkpaul> hm, Christer_, I have  a feeling you're passing in the callback incorrectly
[07:01:34] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @Christer_
[07:01:34] <bot-t> Christer_, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[07:03:52] <Christer_> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/KMSjE/
[07:04:37] <Christer_> that #update should say #film_list btw... just a typo from my part in the fiddle.
[07:05:04] <johnkpaul> ok, so does "List Updated" appear immediately, or after the 10 seconds?
[07:05:23] <Christer_> Immediately
[07:05:34] <Christer_> but i i go to it manyally, it takes 10 seconds.
[07:05:40] <Christer_> manually*
[07:06:42] <johnkpaul> hm, nothing in your javascript seems to point to why that is the case, Christer_, are you sure that it is the same url? maybe console.log the response
[07:07:41] <Christer_> well, if its not the correct url it throws me a 404 in the console and an error one the callback. so that one is double checked.
[07:09:59] <johnkpaul> Christer_: maybe not just the url, what is your backend? it could be expecting accept content type
[07:10:17] <johnkpaul> just make sure that you are actually getting the data that should take 10 seconds, immediately
[07:12:02] <Christer_> Well, its actually a database update script for some movies that gets uploaded trough the FTP - and even tho i can maybe tune it down a bit - i still need some delay to check if the filesize is changing to see if the user uploads the file or if i can move the file to a safe location.
[07:12:07] <Christer_> and update the database.
[07:13:54] <Christer_> So thats why i am having the delay.
[07:15:43] <Hippie__> how do i select a input where the type is file
[07:16:31] <johnkpaul> Hippie__: $("input[type=file]")
[07:16:39] <Hippie__> thanks
[07:17:05] <johnkpaul> Christer_: so the request doesn't necessarily always take 10 seconds
[07:18:05] <Christer_> Its either taking 10 seconds, if there is any new files in the folder - or its done in milliseconds if the folder is empty.. But the 10 seconds is something i have specified.
[07:19:08] <johnkpaul> Christer_: so it is not working correctly when you go to the url directly
[07:19:34] <Christer_> it _is_ working correctly when i go to the URL directly - but not trough ajax.

[07:41:19] <johnkpaul> Jax: if you want to replace all other classes you need to use the dom element itself $().get(0).className="new-class-name"
[07:41:43] <Jax> well my element just has a class, and i want to toggle between two
[07:42:01] <johnkpaul> ?toggleClass @Jax
[07:42:02] <bot-t> Jax, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[07:43:14] <Jax> how do i get the element <i> within an <a><i>â€¦</i></a>
[07:43:26] <Jax> i already have <a> as $(this)
[07:43:36] <Jax> thought it was $(this).next('i')

[07:50:11] <ezio> is there a way to append a child to a div and add an event handler to the child without a selector
[07:52:53] <Rickardo1> How do I check if a return from jquery select is false?   with console.log it give me [] and if($('#class')) give me true
[07:54:37] <thang> Rickardo1: you could do something like if ($('.class').length == 0)
[07:55:10] <Rickardo1> thang: ok, hmm, seems a bit clumpsy?
[07:57:07] <ravenzz> var collection = $('.class'); if (!colletion.length)
[07:57:08] <ravenzz> :?
[07:58:50] <thang> Rickardo1: well you could shorten it to if ($('.class').length)
[08:00:09] <thang> in terms of it being clumsy is debatable, a selector returns a list of matches and if there are no matches the list should be empty; so how else would you check if a jquery selector exists
[08:06:22] <pflock> why does the $().on('click',...) stop working when I have a function executed at document.ready or window.onload ?
[08:08:39] <ezio> is there a way to append a child to a div and add an event handler to the child without a selector
[08:13:41] <ezio> how do you append a child and get a reference to the child so you can add an event?
[08:15:09] <ravenzz> $('.foo').append($('<a/>').bind('click', function(){})); very simplified
[08:15:52] <ezio> ravenzz, but that gives me a reference to foo
[08:16:01] <ezio> that binds a click on foo
[08:16:01] <ravenzz> or var bar = $('<a/>'); $('.foo').append(bar); /* later */ bar.bind('event', function(){});
[08:16:20] <ezio> ah
[08:16:21] <ezio> k
[08:16:27] <ravenzz> damn split
[08:21:13] <ezio> ravenzz, var el = $(html); context.find('.host_list_area').eq(0).append(html); el.click(function () { $(this).parents('.host_list_host').eq(0).remove(); });
[08:21:36] <ezio> it's not hitting the callback
[08:22:10] <ravenzz> are you appending el to the dom?
[08:22:31] <ezio> yes with append
[08:22:34] <ezio> and it is showing
[08:22:51] <ravenzz> am i blind or what

[08:23:19] <ezio> no ... the problem is that el doesn't have a way to be selected
[08:23:26] <pflock> As soon as I execute code at window.onload (even if it's only console.log()), my $().on() functions stop working. somebody knows why?

[08:26:17] <pflock> it is a very long $('div.class').on('click', 'div#id') function. normally it works, but when I have a window.addEventlistener or I write code directly behind the $(document).ready, the click event isn't registered anymore and the function isn't executed

[08:33:06] <javalover> this is fine but what happens is inside the div i'm loading to, it creates this new div
[08:33:20] <javalover> what I want to do is simply load the new inner html directly into the new div
[08:33:46] <javalover> now if I do this using php what I do is echo "<p> hello world<p>" is there anyway to just echo back using javascript?
[08:34:52] <ravenzz> ezio the thing is that you have to append el not html
[08:35:07] <ravenzz> because you will bind the click event to el
[08:35:12] <ezio> OH FOR CHRIST SAKES
[08:35:15] <ravenzz> anyway i have to go
[08:35:17] <ravenzz> ahha

[09:19:41] <ezio> how can i get autocomplete to not update the input box on select?
[09:21:28] <rroelofs> ezio:  iirc there is a 'select' function that you can define
[09:21:46] <ezio> yes but if i set the value of the input, it over writes it
[09:23:00] <rroelofs> ezio http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select  you can cancel the event
[09:25:28] <ezio> rroelofs, how do you cancel?

[09:35:11] <skylamer`> huglester, if jquery looking for that somwhere u can
[09:35:25] <rroelofs> fusion27: .val() will return an array of selected values.  your back end is responsible to handle that.  what lang is your back end in?
[09:35:35] <fusion27> PHP
[09:36:06] <rroelofs> php requires the select name to end with [] in order to automatically make that into an array
[09:36:36] <fusion27> thanks rroelofs
[09:36:45] <skylamer`> maybe
[09:36:49] <skylamer`> select.serialize() to the arraY?

[10:44:13] <philsalesses_> copy what google maps dpes
[10:44:19] <philsalesses_> yeah lacry
[10:45:17] <lacrymology> philsalesses_: what's the point of the callback? what I mean is, yeah, I know I'll need to put any initializing code in a callback, but just trying this from the webkit console, to see if it works, it's not "code" that is failing
[10:45:29] <philsalesses_> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

[11:18:01] <thomedy> but im getting a 302 error which i read means that the url might have been changed
[11:18:10] <thomedy> or a 405 error which is prohibitied
[11:18:21] <thomedy> depending on what url i try
[11:18:27] <thomedy> or what method i chose to ajax it
[11:18:40] <thomedy> right now im focusing on the 405 error which si
[11:18:49] <thomedy> more systematic if i can get around it

[11:44:15] <PhonicUK> hey all
[11:46:52] <captbrogers> Is there a preferred way to apply a plugin to a future element or should I just add a "DOMNodeInserted" event listener on the body tag?
[11:50:43] <salmonete> @captbrogers: you can't initialize the plugin on the element when you're adding it to the page? or you can't fire an event which can bind the plugin init after you add the element?
[11:51:22] <captbrogers> Can't initialize the plugin when adding it to the page...I think.
[11:51:36] <salmonete> do you have a demo?
[11:52:17] <captbrogers> I do, but it's behind a login. Got a minute to wait for me to get it public?
[11:52:50] <salmonete> sure, but before you do that, how are you adding the "future element" to the page?
[11:53:16] <salmonete> is it loaded via ajax, created when the user interacts with something, etc?
[11:53:29] <captbrogers> .load() in a lightbox
[11:54:16] <salmonete> and your load returns html?
[11:54:22] <captbrogers> Yes
[11:54:37] <salmonete> and then in your load's success callback you append the html to the page?
[11:54:48] <captbrogers> Yes
[11:55:05] <MrGlass> Hi, I'm having a weird issue. Jquery is loading & working earlier in my page (i have a working jcarousel), but my onclick lightbox keeps throwing a $ does nto exist error
[11:55:17] <salmonete> but you can't initialize the plugin on that html when you're appending it to the page?
[11:55:42] <catcher> MrGlass, are you using jQuery.noConflict?
[11:55:48] <captbrogers> salmonete: correct
[11:56:03] <salmonete> can you explain why you can't initialize it at that point?
[11:56:04] <MrGlass> catcher: um, i dont think so?
[11:56:30] <MrGlass> (i didn't write the whole page)
[11:56:32] <smykes> Anyone have a sugestion for a production ready popover solution besides Twitter Bootstrap
[11:56:34] <catcher> MrGlass, that may help you. Sounds like a namespace issue. Maybe a prototype library stealing $, etc.
[11:56:46] <MrGlass> fun, k
[11:57:08] <catcher> MrGlass, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[11:58:46] <captbrogers> I'm sorry, I misunderstood you earlier. I can initialize it then, and that is what I am trying. However, it doesn't seem to firing right.
[11:58:56] <captbrogers> Sorry I wasted your time with that other line of questions.
[11:59:09] <salmonete> np. what do you mean it doesn't seem to be firing right?
[11:59:24] <salmonete> when you call the plugin on your returned html, what happens?
[12:00:05] <captbrogers> Nothing, and I expect it to just print something in the console. It should fire on a .change() event
[12:00:33] <MrGlass> catcher: I replaced my code of $.colorbox(...) with jQuery(document).colorbox(...), but now i get a jQuery is not defined error
[12:01:02] <salmonete> yeah it'd probably be helpful to see a demo of it
[12:01:09] <catcher> MrGlass, that's different than using jQuery.noConflict, but may still indicate another problem.
[12:01:20] <catcher> MrGlass, can you pass me a link to the page with the problem?
[12:02:08] <MrGlass> Mind if I pm?
[12:02:12] <catcher> MrGlass, np
[12:04:35] <smykes> Anyone have a production ready popover solution?
[12:05:46] <captbrogers> Ok
[12:35:56] <captbrogers> salmonete: It was a scoping issue, thanks for the help
[12:36:57] <salmonete> sure
[12:37:10] <salmonete> glad you figured it out
[12:42:57] <sorush20_> hi I want to create a menu that wehn I select and <a> in an li the addclass works and changes the css..
[12:43:07] <sorush20_> is there a simple script
[12:43:14] <sorush20_> this would be my first script
[12:44:02] <ascii``> hi, if i do $('#tabs div').hide(); it hides all the divs, even subchilds, how do i limit it to child divs only? thanks!
[12:44:35] <Back2Basics> sorush20_: I don't want to get in the way of your first script.  There is a sanctity to it.
[12:44:46] <tw2113> #tabs>div maybe?
[12:45:30] <ascii``> tw2113, thanks! :)
[12:45:38] <sorush20_> ascii``: I think you just do $(#tabs > div).hide()
[12:45:40] <tw2113> worth a shot
[12:47:07] <Tekth> Hello, Im trying to use appendTo() to show a div when a link is pressed, but I am loosing css style for the new div when its shown.
[12:48:03] <sorush20_> Tekth: what is your code?
[12:48:07] <Tekth> http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/1/
[12:48:23] <Tekth> its weird becuase I loose some style but not all of it
[12:49:06] <brianfreud> Anyone know any sites with a similar service to http://api.online-convert.com/ ?  ie, send them an image in any format via a ws API, get back an image in the format you specify?
[12:52:46] <tw2113> like this? http://image.online-convert.com/
[12:53:07] <shoky> buttt thats likeeee the same domainnnnn
[12:53:10] <tw2113> ah, you want api style so yo ucan ajax it
[12:53:13] <tw2113> you can*
[12:53:40] <tw2113> you said butt
[12:53:42] <tw2113> *snicker*
[12:53:50] <shoky> *smirk*
[13:00:11] <Tekth> Im wondering if perhaps im trying to load the wrong div with appendto()
[13:02:51] <shoky> Tekth its cause you take the div's .html()
[13:03:30] <sayd> im trying to build jquery as a submodule in a git repo with make. i can make -C jquery, but i end up with some cruft in the build process (build/.sizecache.json) is that expected?
[13:04:29] <shoky> Tekth: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/uEtSX/2/
[13:05:26] <Tekth> uhh what you do? lol
[13:05:58] <shoky> removed the .html()
[13:06:08] <Tekth> yeah i see that.. i wonder why that works
[13:06:09] <shoky> and the $()
[13:06:25] <shoky> .html() takes only innerhtml
[13:06:44] <Tekth> I also got it to work by doing <div id="homepage"><div class="homepage"></div></div>
[13:06:57] <Tekth> but think thats unneeded markup
[13:07:00] <shoky> that's just weird
[13:07:08] <Tekth> haha yah
[13:07:26] <andr0id1> anyone familiar with jquery plugin?
[13:07:32] <andr0id1> anyone familiar with jquery validation plugin?
[13:07:54] <shoky> no one
[13:08:35] <andr0id1> :(
[13:15:33] <andr0id1> i just need to do some styling on it, i dont need change in the code
[13:16:29] <brianfreud> shoky, I missed the first bit you said, but you tried http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml ?
[13:17:02] <nFFF> andr0id1, #css ?
[13:19:12] <andr0id1> found it :D
[13:19:24] <nFFF> brianfreud, that presumes your outerhtml is a div element though?
[13:19:28] <andr0id1> sorry for disturbin :D

[13:21:58] <Chopps> hi guys, i need help, i display a gif while the page content is loading in the background, and when the content is fully loaded the gif is removed and the data is displayed, or at least is what i tried to do, but i get this: http://gyazo.com/ce0af57477bd4f3b6674fad4cf17f61e.png the data is displayed before the gif is hidden, can anyone pls tell me what i did wrong?? http://jvholik.info/test/
[13:21:59] <Chopps> < live demo
[13:23:42] <Tekth> I have updated my code with the new version of the jquery code but I am not getting the correct result still.
[13:24:32] <Tekth> http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/4/ is not the same as my version for some reason (http://wwwtheworkingcollegestudent.com/swc/demo/index.html)
[13:26:11] <ehudokai> Chopps: It looks like you are doing your swap on window.load instead of when your content is done loading... can you attach your .load to your content?
[13:26:58] <nFFF> brianfreud, I think this may work better: http://jsfiddle.net/ERvDW/
[13:27:02] <nFFF> leaves markup intact
[13:33:27] <Chopps> ehudokai what do u mean "atach yout .load to your content"?? sorry im not good with jquery
[13:37:16] <ben_m> Hey everyone. I'm reading the accordion docs at the moment and it says the default for header is  "> li > :first-child, > :not(li):even". What does the first part of that mean?
[13:37:34] <clockwize> hey, I want to use document.querySelector to find an <option> containing a certain text, how can I do that? I can see attributes with option[value='123'] but how would I look at the content?
[13:37:39] <ben_m> I'm especially confused about the leading >
[13:39:15] <tw2113> showing us the cotnext would help
[13:39:22] <tw2113> link to the docs page?
[13:39:50] <ben_m> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[13:39:58] <ben_m> Options tab
[13:41:09] <tw2113> ah
[13:41:21] <tw2113> i'm betting it's whatever you put in for the selector
[13:41:26] <tw2113> say #mydiv
[13:41:50] <tw2113> it'd be #mydiv > li > :first-child, > :not(li):even"
[13:41:59] <tw2113> minus that last double quote
[13:42:13] <tw2113> and add in the #mydiv after the comma
[13:42:26] <tw2113> #mydiv > li > :first-child, #mydiv > :not(li):even
[13:44:21] <ben_m> So if the accordion's ID is #mydiv, the default for the headers would be the first child of a <li>? That makes very little sense to me :D
[13:44:44] <ben_m> Actually, that's smart.
[13:44:46] <ben_m> Nevermind :D
[13:44:46] <tw2113> it's my guess, i could be wrong
[13:44:57] <ben_m> I'll try something in a jsfiddle, then come back with results.
[13:46:45] <ben_m> Yep, it's for this: http://jsfiddle.net/ben_m/s67gM/
[13:47:22] <ben_m> Thanks for helping me understand, I would've never figured out the default uses the accordion's id.
[13:52:49] <mordof> I'm trying to extend jquery to include a timer thing, but i want it to also have some private methods. used as such: $.jsTimer.start(); $.jsTimer.stop(); etc.. having a bit of trouble with it. Will post jsfiddle of it in a sec, but does anyone have any links to articles on this?
[13:55:09] <mordof> http://jsfiddle.net/wt69R/1/  what i'm trying to get to work..
[13:55:27] <Lundy> hi guys, im not sure if this is the right channel ..... im trying to produce a search result for some products iv got stored in a database...... but the problem im having is that im going to have "view product" link so if my REPS click back they get that "you need to re-submit" the form .... is there a way of bypassing that, so it just brings back up my search result?
[13:56:01] <mordof> likely doesn't work because of what the extend is doing (i'm assuming it's moving the methods and placing them somewhere else, hence making it out of scope)
[13:57:14] <mordof> Lundy: well, i think there's a couple different ways. the only way i can think of off hand isn't going to be one you're going to enjoy though :p
[13:57:43] <Tekth> Hi, Im trying to see why this (http://jsfiddle.net/Y5LnU/) isnt working like this (http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/4/)
[13:57:47] <mordof> Lundy: if you catch the submit and place the form submit using ajax, and retrieve the results / populate the page on success, and use hashing to remember history - that would solve it for you
[13:57:56] <mordof> Lundy: but there may be easier ways, i'm really not sure
[13:58:24] <mordof> the url hash*
[14:00:23] <Lundy> was thinking of using GET on the form submit ......
[14:00:43] <mordof> Lundy: why wouldn't you be in the first place?
[14:00:49] <mordof> Lundy: you're retrieving information
[14:01:11] <Lundy> could use POST ?
[14:01:28] <mordof> Get = retrieving information. Post = submitting information
[14:01:40] <mordof> there's no reason to use POST if you're retrieving information from the server
[14:02:34] <Lundy> i would post information to search my DB  to then retrive the answers
[14:02:37] <mordof> Lundy: as far as i'm aware they're implemented basically the same - but if using GET solves your problem, there's no reason why you shouldn't be using it
[14:02:58] <mordof> Lundy: nah - you're retrieving information from your database
[14:03:56] <Validatorian> what's the best way to get the cumulative height of several elements?
[14:04:06] <Validatorian> I'm considering using .map, but not sure if that's the best way
[14:04:11] <dany_> I am trying to load a piece of a page with .load. But the href attribute is a variable. When i try tohe following code it says 404 not found ant the variable wont turn into a link > " $(".region-menu .content a").click(function(event){
[14:04:11] <dany_>             var url = $(this).attr("href");
[14:04:11] <dany_>             $("#content").load("url #content");
[14:04:11] <dany_>             event.preventDefault();"
[14:04:31] <dany_> Does anyone know what i am doing wrong?
[14:04:51] <mordof> dany_: read the documentation on .load
[14:05:01] <dany_> allready tried that
[14:05:06] <sayd> dany_: .load(url + "#content")
[14:05:07] <mordof> dany_: you're using it *very* wrong :\
[14:05:33] <NoiseEee> dany_: what sayd said.  url is a variable.
[14:06:12] <mordof> "#content" still shouldn't be in there
[14:06:17] <dany_> yhank you very much. ust a beginner so trying to learn
[14:06:33] <mordof> there's no point in appending a hash to a server request
[14:06:48] <mordof> dany_: .load(url)
[14:07:29] <dany_> Ok thank you i think i can figure the rest out with the docs
[14:08:02] <NoiseEee> mordof: you can indeed use it that way
[14:08:04] <dany_> It works :D
[14:08:07] <Tekth> If I use the code of the result page from http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/5/ it doesnt work.
[14:08:23] <Tekth> I just get the div sections stacking vertically on teh page
[14:09:07] <mordof> NoiseEee: o.O .load takes a url as an argument. to my knowledge #information at the end of a url gets pretty much ignored by the server
[14:09:35] <NoiseEee> mordof: http://api.jquery.com/load/ "Loading Page Fragments"
[14:10:07] <mordof> ahh
[14:10:17] <mordof> so it's not something related to the server, that makes more sense
[14:10:39] <mordof> ahh that's so sloppy!!!
[14:11:02] <mordof> NoiseEee: that's encouraging some very bad practices right there ;_;
[14:11:19] <mordof> it could have it's uses.. but really that's not a good idea imo
[14:11:49] <NoiseEee> mordof: <shrug> :)
[14:11:56] <mordof> heh
[14:14:23] <mordof> still haven't figured out why this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/wt69R/1/  x.x;
[14:15:08] <mordof> well, i have a general idea, but no idea how to fix it to make it work as i want it to

[14:27:55] <Validatorian> does jQuery have a method of selecting the first occurance of an element that is _currently visible_ in the view? (that is to say, others may be visible, but above/below the current view, and they won't be selected) -- I'm dealing with a _lot_ of elements here, so checking their offsets individually isn't going to be very efficient

[14:51:17] <catcher> andr0id1, you'll get more response if you get a working model in jsfiddle
[14:52:00] <andr0id1> well, it is pulling data from a db...
[14:53:11] <catcher> andr0id1, it'll also help if you tell us what's not working, any reported errors/warnings, etc.
[14:54:18] <andr0id1> i dont get any errors or warnings , nothing, when i click + or - in the script, it doesnt happen anything, but it works fine in chrome or firefox
[14:54:22] <andr0id1> but not in ie
[14:55:23] <catcher> andr0id1, can you give us a link?
[14:55:42] <andr0id1> its on my local server, thats the big thingie
[14:58:08] <andr0id1> catcher: here's a link : http://slavcho.php-dev.net/tintar/
[14:58:22] <Driftwood> Hi everyone, I was looking through the jQuery api and docs and net.tutsplus.com and I can't fifure out how to make sure my variables are getting POST'ed correctly when I'm submitting a form using jquery to a php file
[14:58:54] <Driftwood> Normally I would let the php script/page load then use vardump, but I can't use that now...
[14:59:46] <andr0id1> catcher: thats my original demo
[15:01:05] <andr0id1> can you tell me why it is not working only in IE?
[15:02:05] <eddiemonge> Driftwood: why cant you? look at the response in the inspector
[15:02:27] <krz> is there a plugin/lib that capitalizes first letters in a sentence?
[15:03:17] <Driftwood> eddiemonge: I'm going to sound really dumb, how do I use Firebug to do that? (I'm assuming that's the inspector you're talkikng about)
[15:03:25] <rycar> I know how to see if one of an element's parents has an attribute, but how do I get the value of that attribute?   For example <div data-test="yay"><ul><li><span>Hi</span></li></ul></div>   I have $('span') already and from there I need to get the value of data-test
[15:03:56] <rycar> also I don't know how far up the parent chain it is
[15:03:59] <krz> is there titleize for query?
[15:04:41] <eddiemonge> Driftwood:  i use chrome developer tools. see http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:05:39] <eddiemonge> rycar:  $("span").closest("div[data-test='yay']").data('test')
[15:05:46] <eddiemonge> krz: a who?
[15:06:44] <krz> or some kind of inflections library
[15:06:59] <krz> "foo bar" I'm trying to convert to "Foo Bar"
[15:07:24] <andr0id1> what about my problem?
[15:08:00] <eddiemonge> krz: have you looked at phpjs?
[15:08:18] <krz> no. i don't use php
[15:08:31] <Driftwood> eddiemonge: Got it, thanks. I didn't realize the dev tools could do that. Also I appreciate the tutorial on debugging!
[15:09:21] <eddiemonge> andr0id1: 1) .live() is deprecated. 2)upgrade your jQuery. 3) I dont know what your problem is
[15:09:32] <eddiemonge> krz: thats not what i said. i said have you looked at phpjs?
[15:09:43] <eddiemonge> Driftwood: thank ajpiano
[15:10:08] <eddiemonge> andr0id1: 4) cache $(this)
[15:10:11] <catcher> andr0id1, change application/javascript to text/javascript
[15:10:33] <krz> eddiemonge: yea and i don't use php
[15:10:51] <eddiemonge> andr0id1: 5) parseInt needs the second param
[15:10:54] <krz> and i rather stay away from anything that has to do with it
[15:11:16] <eddiemonge> krz: really? wow ok then i wont say anything more
[15:11:24] <eddiemonge> even though it has nothing to do with php really
[15:11:31] <catcher> andr0id1, and also everything eddiemonge said
[15:11:45] <krz> its a port of php functions to js. how does that have nothing to do with php?
[15:12:18] <krz> now if it was rubyjs or railsjs. then i would definitely give it a go
[15:12:54] <krz> anything involving php is icky
[15:13:44] <eddiemonge> krz:  that attitude just sucks and really irks me. php is a fine language for the most part. and the fact that you are completely ignoring a fine toolkit just because it has "php" in its name is super-elitist
[15:14:38] <eddiemonge> especially when it solves a problem you are asking about
[15:15:37] <eddiemonge> again, it has absolutely nothing to do with php other than bring some functions that it has to javascript. basic functions that are pretty langauge agnostic
[15:15:48] <krz> eddiemonge: its not that php isn't a fine language. phpjs is a port of PHP functions into JS. have you looked at the lib? do i really want to use this bulky library just for a titleize feature?
[15:15:52] <eddiemonge>  </rant>
[15:16:10] <eddiemonge> krz:  then look at how they do that function and just use that
[15:16:46] <eddiemonge> http://phpjs.org/functions/ucwords:569
[15:16:49] <krz> AND php is a fine language for the most part is debatable
[15:17:14] <eddiemonge> literally 4 lines of js code
[15:17:29] <eddiemonge> same can be said about ruby/rails
[15:17:34] <eddiemonge> and python
[15:17:37] <eddiemonge> and perl
[15:17:49] <eddiemonge> and C/C++/C#/Objective-C
[15:18:01] <eddiemonge> and every other programming language ever created
[15:18:18] <krz> i take it you code on php
[15:19:22] <zoned> is there a better way to populate a select box from an ajax call than just generating/injecting the html?
[15:19:30] <krz> try ruby or python and you'll see what i mean
[15:19:53] <krz> perl for web dev? you gotta be nuts
[15:19:56] <eddiemonge> zoned:  not really
[15:20:33] <eddiemonge> krz:  you are either new to web dev or someone who has been doing it for decades
[15:21:22] <krz> neither. I've been in the business long enough to differentiate between the merits of php and all its frameworks compared to something like ruby and its framework rails
[15:21:34] <snover> php sucks, but so does rails
[15:21:44] <snover> so enjoy arguing which one sucks less
[15:21:47] <snover> in the meantime
[15:21:51] <snover> JQUERY ANYONE?
[15:22:13] <krz> snover is clearly on django :-P
[15:22:27] <krz> or nodejs :-D
[15:24:02] <eddiemonge> django
[15:24:26] <eddiemonge> and yes django sucks, rails sucks, python sucks, ruby sucks and even php sucks
[15:24:43] <eddiemonge> but people like each of them and use them all so they obviously have their strengths or they wouldnt
[15:24:52] <eddiemonge> why do i always get sucked into these arguments?
[15:25:03] <eddiemonge> every week even???
[15:25:13] <eddiemonge> andr0id1: get it figured out?
[15:28:34] <Danwe> is there a way to select all elements in the dom having data() with a specific key?
[15:29:11] <Danwe> I mean not a way, I mean a selector or other predefined thing by jQuery. Of course I could write my own
[15:29:44] <eddiemonge> you mean like all elements that have data-something as an attribute?
[15:29:46] <johnkpaul> Danwe: not without serious hacks, why not add a class or something?
[15:30:23] <Danwe> johnkplaul: Alright, I guess a class would do it as well
[15:30:51] <eddiemonge> Danwe: what do you mean though, can you give an example of what you are looking for?
[15:31:28] <johnkpaul> if it's a data attrbute, you can use the attribute selector directly but if it's what you've set with $.data(el,name,value), you'll need to hack around with $.cache
[15:31:46] <Danwe> eddiemonge: I use $( myelem ).data( "myplugin", mydata ) and later I want all elements in the dom having data with the key "myplugin"
[15:33:10] <eddiemonge> Danwe:  you could add them to a collection and track that collection
[15:33:28] <Danwe> My problem with using a class is, that I only want to get the elem as long as remove() wasn't called on it. Data will vanish after remove(), the class won't...
[15:33:43] <Danwe> same with the collection^^
[15:33:55] <ajpiano> Danwe: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L195-198
[15:34:03] <ajpiano> Danwe: there are better ways to tell if an element is in the DOM or not than that
[15:34:06] <ajpiano> if that's what you're trying to do
[15:34:45] <ajpiano> Danwe: $(".foo").filter(function() {  return !!$.data( elem, "dataKeyName" ); });
[15:34:55] <ajpiano> is a data search
[15:35:16] <ajpiano> and you can use see ?$.contains
[15:35:17] <bot-t> ajpiano, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[15:35:22] <ajpiano> if you want to see if something is in the dom or not
[15:35:23] <ajpiano> danit
[15:35:26] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains
[15:35:26] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[15:35:28] <ajpiano> ^^
[15:35:31] <ajpiano> ok shower
[15:35:33] <ajpiano> sorry!
[15:35:36] <ajpiano> for jumping in!!
[15:37:30] <Danwe> so how about $( "*").filter( function() { return !!$.data( elem, "dataKeyName" ); }); or is it too expensive?
[15:39:03] <ajpiano> it's pretty expensive
[15:39:11] <ajpiano> why do you need to check for whether it's data has been removed
[15:39:43] <ajpiano> its*
[15:40:10] <johnkpaul> :) ajpiano, it's not a problem
[15:40:20] <johnkpaul> Danwe: I think you'd be better served by storing your data differently
[15:40:39] <Danwe> I wrote an ui thingy and have to handle some stuff on each window.resize event
[15:40:46] <johnkpaul> rather than searching through the dom, or the data, for where your plugin has been added, keep some other record of your plugin elements
[15:40:54] <ajpiano> or using .detach() instead of remove()
[15:40:58] <ajpiano> so that you don't lose handlers and data
[15:41:00] <ajpiano> ok seriously
[15:41:06] <ajpiano> goodnight :)
[15:41:28] <johnkpaul> :) good night
[15:41:32] <Danwe> good night and thanks!
[15:41:58] <johnkpaul> Danwe: so you need to update all of your plugin sinstanes when the window resizes?
[15:42:00] <johnkpaul> instances*
[15:42:06] <Danwe> yes
[15:42:49] <Danwe> how would I keep record, when one uses remove() this would also remove the plugins functionality on the object but I couldn't remove the thing from my collection when it is called
[15:43:06] <locojay> hi i m using datatables all works fine server side and displaying. but i can't press next previous button. no css nothing just script jquery.dataTables.js . any idea?
[15:43:07] <johnkpaul> so then when your plugin is initialized, why not store a refernece to this somewhere accessible from outside
[15:43:20] <johnkpaul> Danwe: so override the remove() to remove from your data store
[15:44:10] <Danwe> johnkpaul: thought about that, some people consider it hacky but I'd consider it
[15:44:28] <johnkpaul> it's your plugin, why would that be hacky?
[15:44:45] <eddiemonge> locojay:  code helps to debug
[15:44:47] <Danwe> remove() is a jQuery base functionality
[15:45:07] <johnkpaul> oh, your calling remove directly on the dom elements?
[15:45:24] <johnkpaul> why doesn't all of your code know about your plugin
[15:45:27] <Danwe>   and there are other ways to remove an element from the DOM, not sure what would happen to the data then though
[15:46:16] <johnkpaul> ideally, I think that's what you'd be changing
[15:46:30] <johnkpaul> if it's a plugin, use the plugin's own remove functionality
[15:47:37] <Danwe> now I don't understand, guess I should read more about jQuery plugins. So far its just an additional function $.myplugin initializing some stuff, pretty similar to tipsy() for example
[15:48:11] <eddiemonge> Danwe:  what are you trying to do exactly with your plugin?
[15:48:24] <johnkpaul> the word "jquery plugin" is slightly ambiguous, that's why
[15:48:37] <Danwe> eddiemonge: its for input boxes, so they grow or shrink when typing
[15:48:45] <johnkpaul> it can be as complicated as you'd like
[15:48:58] <johnkpaul> Danwe: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[15:50:17] <locojay> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/2727973. server return first pagination. but i can't press nothing or nothing get sent to server...
[15:51:24] <eddiemonge> Danwe:  ok so why are you setting data on the elements and checking for them?
[15:52:05] <eddiemonge> locojay:  jsfiddle/jsbin examples are better
[15:52:15] <Danwe> eddiemonge: because as long as the data exists, remove() wasn't called and my plugin is suppose to do its job
[15:52:47] <Rajko> im trying to use the jquery file upload ajax thing
[15:52:53] <Rajko> and it works in chrome but not firefox on my page
[15:52:57] <Danwe> if the element isn't in the dom, it would still work, just having a break until the element in back to the dom
[15:52:59] <Rajko> on it's default page, with the same config works on boths
[15:52:59] <Rajko> wtf
[15:55:38] <eddiemonge> Danwe:  maybe you should post your code so we can help you?
[15:55:58] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  what jquery file upload ajax thing?
[15:56:12] <Rajko> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[15:58:30] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  did you file an issue for it?
[15:58:45] <Rajko> if i gave you the url could you check for obvious errors ?
[15:58:52] <Danwe> eddiemonge: If you'd like to look at it: http://pastebin.com/MUmwJBS7
[15:59:31] <Danwe> line 80 is the interesting part
[15:59:45] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  sure i guess
[15:59:54] <eddiemonge> ugh i hate pastebin but ok
[15:59:57] <Danwe> how I handle the resize right now. But I'd rather just register one resize and handle all inputs from there
[16:00:21] <Danwe> sorry
[16:00:31] <johnkpaul> Danwe: do you have control in the code where .remove() is called?
[16:00:44] <johnkpaul> if so, why not call something like .inputAutoExpand("remove")
[16:00:56] <Danwe> johnkpaul: I have, but I'd like to do it generic and re-usable for any case
[16:01:27] <johnkpaul> then add an event listener for a custom event to the dom element
[16:01:33] <johnkpaul> and trigger it after every removal
[16:01:41] <Danwe> johnkpaul: I think its ugly. What if one does $( elem ).remove(); ?
[16:02:47] <johnkpaul> hm, Danwe, you're going to need to standardize your API somewhow, someone could elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem) too
[16:03:21] <Rajko> eddiemonge, http://wan.rajkonet.info/index2.html is their sample, stripped of everything i dont need, and it works fine in both firefox and chrome
[16:03:33] <johnkpaul> if you're useing a widget, I don't think it's unreasonable to enforce that the widget is torn down correctly, Danwe
[16:03:35] <johnkpaul> using*
[16:03:42] <Rajko> http://wan.rajkonet.info/index.html is their sample in my page, and everything is identical except for the DOM and styling
[16:03:50] <Rajko> doesnt work in FF (clicking on add file does nothing)
[16:03:56] <Danwe> johnkpaul: thats exactly why I don't want to simply override remove()
[16:04:10] <johnkpaul> Danwe: I'm not telling you to override remove()
[16:04:18] <Danwe> that's why I thought the checking for .data() would be a nice approach
[16:04:19] <johnkpaul> 19:00 johnkpaul: if so, why not call something like .inputAutoExpand("remove")
[16:05:06] <Danwe> ^^ so the user had to call that when he is calling remove()
[16:05:11] <johnkpaul> no
[16:05:13] <johnkpaul> call that instead of remove
[16:05:29] <johnkpaul> and your widget can handle however it needs to remove itself
[16:05:55] <Danwe> that's what I don't like. It still would be broken when calling elem.parentNode.removeChild(elem) or just remove()
[16:06:15] <Danwe> you would force the user to call.inputAutoExpand("remove")
[16:06:28] <Danwe> its wouldn't be integrated nicely
[16:06:34] <Rajko> how do i figure out why the "add files" button doesnt react to clicks ?
[16:06:50] <johnkpaul> yeah, I guess that's an opinion, IMHO, that's much more nicely integrated and it is not unreasonable to make sure that a widget is torn down correctly
[16:06:53] <johnkpaul> if you're using a widget
[16:07:13] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't automatically know if you do things that hack around it's API
[16:08:11] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  i would start with the example that works and then add pieces one by one until it no longer works to see whats breaking it
[16:08:21] <Rajko> i DID.
[16:08:29] <eddiemonge> so what broke it?
[16:08:35] <Rajko> surrounding it in my html
[16:08:46] <eddiemonge> which part specifically?
[16:08:56] <eddiemonge> the DOM, adding in CSS, adding in other JS?
[16:09:03] <Rajko> i tried without the js, without the css
[16:09:12] <Rajko> it works fine in chrome
[16:09:28] <Danwe> jonkpaul: yeah, as so often these are rather idealistic questions. Basically my code works within my project and for everyone reading the docs, so I am just searching the perfect pattern which probably doesn't exist ;)
[16:09:53] <Rajko> ive been at this for an HOUR
[16:10:31] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  i mean literally, add in each line one by one testing to see if it still works with that line
[16:10:39] <Rajko> that would break the dom
[16:10:51] <eddiemonge> how so?
[16:10:59] <Rajko> adding html line by line isnt a good idea
[16:12:06] <johnkpaul> Danwe: :) yes, there is no perfection, just approximations. I think that once you get used to the encapsulation that a widget allows for, you'll find that having a widget handle it's own setup and tear down make more sense, but many other options work
[16:12:49] <eddiemonge> Rajko: why not? you also have a random closing span on line 35
[16:13:46] <Rajko> eddiemonge, my style breaks it.
[16:13:51] <Rajko> what...the..hell
[16:14:25] <Rajko> not even the link tag, the actual file
[16:14:46] <eddiemonge> ?
[16:14:55] <Rajko> if i rename the file.css to something so it doesnt include
[16:14:58] <Rajko> the form works.
[16:15:48] <krz> $('#top_hits ul li:eq(0)').data('created-at', 'foo'); firebug doesn't display the new data attribute in the li element
[16:15:56] <krz> am i doing it right?
[16:17:03] <eddiemonge> Rajko:  looks like you took out the less stuff
[16:17:08] <Rajko> yes
[16:17:09] <johnkpaul> krz: .data() doesn't write to attributes
[16:17:11] <Rajko> i did
[16:17:14] <johnkpaul> it only reads to attributes
[16:17:15] <eddiemonge> krz:  because it stores it in memory
[16:17:16] <Rajko> but just mystyle.css which is just CSS
[16:17:19] <johnkpaul> reads from*
[16:17:22] <Rajko> if included, breaks it
[16:18:05] <Rajko> can you click on add files on index1.html ?
[16:18:15] <krz> hm
[16:18:21] <Rajko> if in firefox
[16:18:39] <eddiemonge> try adding type="text/css"  to your css link
[16:19:16] <johnkpaul> krz: if you need it in an attribute, use ?.attr
[16:19:16] <bot-t> krz, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[16:19:33] <krz> ah
[16:19:47] <Rajko> eddiemonge, doesnt matter, and if you see, all of "their" css doesnt have it
[16:20:36] <johnkpaul> krz: if you read the ?.data documentation, it explains the differences
[16:22:27] <Rajko> its the css override of the form file input thing breaking i think
[16:30:00] <Tekth> is it possible to use appendto() and animate({opacity: #.#}, "slow"); together?
[16:30:41] <sunbeam> any flexslider users around here?
[16:30:53] <sunbeam> I'd like to know how i can define that the arrows are for back and forth between the img slides
[16:49:36] <hillct> Good evening all. Can someone recommend a jQuery plugin that implements a resize/crop interface similar to this: http://www.trepmag.ch/z/jrac/example/ that works effectively on touchScreen devices like an iPad ?
[16:51:06] <oojacoboo> jcrop?
[16:58:31] <`Korvin> Is there a way to match against multiple names at once?
[16:58:59] <oojacoboo> $("$foo, #bar").method();
[16:59:11] <oojacoboo> $foo = #foo
[17:03:36] <z1000> anyone know how to officially use after callback for jquery cycle
[17:08:13] <z1000> is there a way to know which # slide is active for cycle plugin
[17:09:53] <SunSparc> A Google Map shows up fine the first time a page is viewed, but then after jQuerying off the page and back to it again, the Google Map will not show up.
[17:10:18] <z1000> is there a way to set a variable to the child count
[17:10:38] <z1000> $('.hb span:nth-child(1)') but use a variable so like $('.hb span).childNum($var)
[17:10:56] <z1000> what is the call for childNum ?
[17:11:37] <Esailija> well you could just concatenate it in the selector string in the first place
[17:11:44] <AwesomeGarethMan> .removeClass() - any gotchas with it?
[17:11:59] <Esailija> '.hb span:nth-child('+num+')'
[17:12:46] <AwesomeGarethMan> i'm trying to use .removeClass() to remove a nice little hilighted border from a button and long story short it ain't working
[17:14:23] <Tekth> Id like to know if the opacity animation that I have used in conjunction with  appendto() can occur everytime and not just the first time its used. http://jsfiddle.net/uEtSX/11/
[17:15:47] <z1000> http://codepad.org/PJP7m3m6 I just want the 3 spans to fade to a color individually when relevant slide is active... any ideas?
[17:15:50] <bmanz> AwesomeGarethMan: what about using removeAttr()?
[17:16:07] <AwesomeGarethMan> never mind actually, i'm a moron
[17:16:13] <bmanz> nah
[17:16:15] <AwesomeGarethMan> i never defined the class, it's inline CSS
[17:16:18] <bmanz> ok
[17:16:23] <AwesomeGarethMan> someone gimme a good slap
[17:16:32] <bmanz> You probably didn't do what I just got through
[17:16:34] <bmanz> lol
[17:16:35] <AwesomeGarethMan> i literally just hit myself here....
[17:17:14] <z1000> can someone help me figure this out :? http://collabedit.com/8cjby
[17:17:28] <z1000> just need the after function to animate the next span color
[17:17:28] <bmanz> I beat my brains out for 2 days, trying to figure out why in a Drupal site, I couldn't get data to appear
[17:17:29] <bmanz> lol
[17:17:41] <bmanz> I didn't have the div there to recieve it
[17:17:49] <AwesomeGarethMan> bmanz: we all have our stupid moments
[17:17:52] <hillct> oojacoboo: thanks. When last I'd seen jCrop It didn't include touch support
[17:17:55] <bmanz> aye, we do
[17:18:04] <oojacoboo> hillct, sure
[17:18:35] <z1000> any tips anyone?
[17:19:22] <hillct> oojacoboo: the trick will be incorporating the zoom functionality seen in jRAC, which I imagine is basically some math related to css scaling
[17:41:25] <bobbytek2> anyone have opinions as to how to organize js files in project? Specifically, does one move a jquery plugin's css and images to css/ and img/ or within a folder such as js/?
[17:41:36] <bobbytek2> Just curious what the convention is
[17:42:25] <Dr-Bombay> yes, everyone has an opinion :)
[17:43:15] <bobbytek2> Great
[17:43:25] <bobbytek2> Lets hear em :)
[17:48:46] <tw2113> some thing deserve folders
[17:49:13] <Dr-Bombay> opinion: don't duplicate code
[17:50:19] <bobbytek2> I guess my question is, where do jquery plugins go, and should they be decomposed by asset type?
[17:50:46] <tw2113> sure, why not
[17:51:10] <tw2113> there's no "best practice", it's all personal opinion and styles
[17:51:14] <systemfault> bobbytek: That's what I personally do
[17:51:20] <bobbytek2> tw2113, because image references in css need to chage, upgrading is harding, etc.
[17:51:33] <bobbytek2> *change
[17:51:48] <tw2113> so plan well before you start and stick to it afterwards
[17:51:55] <systemfault> Changing the path of a few images in a CSS file isn't that difficult
[17:52:07] <bobbytek2> that's not the point
[17:52:27] <bobbytek2> I'm trying to understand the benefit
[17:52:46] <tw2113> organization?
[17:52:49] <bobbytek2> I can only see downside, except for the organization it provides
[17:52:52] <bobbytek2> right
[17:52:57] <tw2113> what downside?
[17:53:24] <bobbytek2> having to merge changes to an updated lib
[17:53:28] <Klevre> $("#test") <-- how can I get "test" as text ?
[17:54:04] <systemfault> Klevre: .attr('id') ?
[17:54:05] <bobbytek2> Klevre, the element text or the selector value?
[17:54:17] <Klevre> bobbytek: selector val
[17:54:30] <tw2113> $('#text').attr('id');
[17:55:05] <bobbytek2> well, that works in this case, but perhaps not in general
[17:55:16] <bobbytek2> there is a .selector property as well
[17:55:25] <bobbytek2> (of jquery objects)
[18:05:49] <ragnok> hi, what is the most used by jquerians...less or scss ?
[18:06:43] <ragnok> scss seems more supported...
[18:06:51] <bobbytek2> anyone using jquery with backbone? Just curious on when one might create a jquery plugin vs. a backbone component
[18:08:32] <snover> ragnok: neither because they are both terrible. use stylus and welcome to happiness.
[18:08:42] <tw2113> for some reason, i decided to dump less for sass
[18:08:55] <tw2113> despite not a lot of direct interest in ruby
[18:10:23] <tw2113> i even had node set up for compiling
[18:10:50] <ragnok> thanks for the input. i was thinking in stylus, aslo because my server is node, but, it just seems too much for me, too much logic. i was just really looking for the variables and mixins for @media queries. i think scss is easier, i mean, ore basics.
[18:11:17] <ragnok> yes, i've seen it. saas.js
[18:11:26] <snover> ragnok: like all of them stylus is just a superset of cxss
[18:11:28] <snover> css*
[18:11:32] <snover> any valid css is valid stylus
[18:11:34] <snover> so just use the variables
[18:11:39] <snover> and keep everything else the same
[18:12:01] <snover> you do not need to, nor would I recommend, omitting braces, etc.
[18:12:59] <ragnok> mm, and how would i go about doing responsive design with stylus?any link, tut?
[18:13:43] <ragnok> i was thinking to use www.semantic.gs , it runs native with less, but it supports stylus and scss also
[18:13:46] <tw2113> meh @ dropping brackets and semicolons
[18:14:25] <tw2113> keeping them makes it easier to debug where's going wrong
[18:14:55] <ragnok> yes, i prefer the normal syntax.
[18:16:11] <Dr-Bombay> my reaction is more severe than "meh"
[18:16:30] <ragnok> k, i will go for stylus with normal syntax, and just use the var and mixins
[18:16:30] <Dr-Bombay> it's more like "begone, unclean spawn of hell"
[18:16:38] <Less_Seen> ^ lol
[18:17:50] <Dr-Bombay> I mean f------ h---, do people think they're just writing code for themselves
[18:18:23] <ragnok> i've done something wrong? x.x
[18:20:27] <anusx4> why prefer the normal css syntax, I mean it's true all those braces and semicolons are meaningless
[18:31:31] <ragnok> i got dc..thanks for the tips
[18:31:58] <ragnok> just creating an app with express, socketio and stylus
[18:33:38] <ragnok> and jquery ofc :)
[18:55:17] <minijupe> is there a way to get a stack trace for an error in chrome?
[18:55:22] <minijupe> or anywhere?
[18:56:11] <shoky> you can usually expand the error in the console to see the stack trace
[18:59:01] <minijupe> shoky: where do I click to expand the error, if I click it it takes me to the js script that caused it, but since it's a VERY long line of code (uglified) I really don't know how to troubleshoot
[18:59:52] <tw2113> unminify
[19:00:32] <shoky> you can click 'pretty print' button in chrome
[19:00:58] <shoky> and, when i expand errors in the console i see the stack trace
[19:01:13] <shoky> click the little arrow on the left..
[19:01:18] <devinceartas> Hard to debug mini died code -- but if it's showing the bug in jquery, chances are that's not really it
[19:04:54] <minijupe> no the bug is in a jquery pligin
[19:05:13] <minijupe> I don't have a little arrow to expand, where is the pretty print?
[19:07:39] <nlogax> there should be something like this, minijupe http://i.imgur.com/wO3LE.png
[19:09:53] <minijupe> nlogax: tnx for that, but mine looks very different. What version of chrome are you running?
[19:10:18] <nlogax> minijupe: only had safari at hand, but both use webkit inspector
[19:11:39] <minijupe> nlogax: are you saying the little green arrow expands?
[19:13:04] <tw2113> chrome 18 has  { } for pretty print
[19:13:06] <nlogax> minijupe: that's just the line... which is quite useless :) but you ave the call stack, can step around, inspect vars etc
[19:14:45] <tw2113> at least on linux
[19:16:31] <minijupe> i updated chrome and the inspector has changed. Guess I was out of date.
[19:16:35] <minijupe> lemme look around
[19:17:00] <shoky> minijupe: the devtools have to be open when the error occurs, if you wanna see the stack trace
[19:18:08] <shoky> and that's the arrow: http://i.imgur.com/GjRvR.png
[19:18:37] <shoky> and im on chrome 20 ;p
[19:19:44] <minijupe> i think the error is coming from actionscript inside the flowplayer swf
[19:19:53] <shoky> o_O
[19:20:10] <minijupe> the error only shows up when I reference the player via https :(
[19:20:16] <minijupe> it's a pretty strange error.
[19:20:22] <shoky> what error
[19:20:45] <minijupe> Uncaught Error: Error in Actionscript. Use a try/catch block to find error. flowplayer-3.2.0.min.js:24
[19:20:46] <minijupe> Uncaught Error: Error calling method on NPObject.
[19:20:57] <shoky> eek
[19:21:28] <minijupe> but I need the player on an https page, and all resources have to be referenced w/ https
[19:21:28] <minijupe> :(
[19:22:07] <minijupe> took me 2 hours to track down what was causing the error in the first place
[19:25:56] <Aquilas> hmmm why does my javascript work in FF and chrome but not internet explorer 9...
[19:28:56] <systemfault> Because you use features that are not available on IE9...
[19:29:07] <systemfault> What else it could be?
[19:29:20] <systemfault> Look at your debugger...
[19:29:36] <systemfault> So you can find the statement that errors on IE9
[19:30:28] <tw2113> helps to state what isn't working Aquilas
[20:27:18] <krz> how do i execute something after fadeOut?
[20:27:28] <krz> is there a callback for fadeout()
[20:27:37] <shoky> yes
[20:28:28] <systemfault> docâ€¦ is the key
[20:28:43] <tw2113> .fadeOut().something() ?
[20:28:52] <shoky> LoL
[20:29:06] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:29:13] <systemfault> documentationâ€¦ is the key
[20:29:13] <oojacoboo> shoky, come on man, don't always have to be a dick
[20:29:25] <shoky> tf? how was i a dick
[20:29:30] <tw2113> i'm alright with shoky being a dick to me
[20:29:35] <oojacoboo> ha
[20:29:41] <oojacoboo> tw2113 likes the dick
[20:29:42] <tw2113> i deserve it and know it most of the time
[20:29:52] <shoky> the first line in the docs for fadeout is: .fadeOut( [duration] [, callback] )
[20:30:06] <shoky> derrrr does fadeout have a callback derrr?!
[20:30:16] <systemfault> shoky: WHOA! You found it!
[20:30:20] <systemfault> shoky:++
[20:30:29] <shoky> it was quite a struggle
[20:30:47] <systemfault> shoky: I guess that's because you're mentally challenged..
[20:31:07] <shoky> i probably am
[21:18:21] <psyolus> Anyone have any tips for working with 64 bit integers in javascript?
[21:28:32] <Dr-Bombay> psyolus: It's not part of the language yet. You'll have to use a library.
[21:28:42] <psyolus> That's what I thought
[22:09:14] <ruby_on_tails> hey peeps
[23:58:34] <_helpPlz_> hey am i doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/9RfSL/ .. why .closest() isn't working?
[23:59:04] <_helpPlz_> ? closest
