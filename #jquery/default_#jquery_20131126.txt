[00:00:00] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem here: if you go to https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm press VM, then say Win 2008, and then click on "Details" text to open a jQuery UI dialog, then close it, reopen and repeat few times - eventually it starts to get stuck, leaving parts of the dialog open - why is that happening?
[00:07:36] <Serdar> hi
[00:09:33] <lite_> $('a').not(".overlay").on('click', function... this would set a click trigger on all anchors that do not have the class overlay correct?
[00:10:13] <Serdar> which tab plugin is the most stable one?
[00:12:35] <_rgn> lite_: how about logging the expression without .on() and seeing what it returns
[00:14:47] <Whiskey> $(id).eq(0).find("td").not(":last-child").css("width", "1px") <- what does last-child mean?
[00:16:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: your back
[00:16:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> what up
[00:16:56] <grafi> busy doing stuff ^^

[00:43:21] <tables> how do i reload a div in jquery?
[00:43:25] <tables> it's not an ajax request
[00:45:57] <mehrdad_> wtf wtf
[00:46:11] <mehrdad_> i can't drop button using draggable
[00:46:19] <mehrdad_> yet same code works for textbox
[00:46:41] <mehrdad_> any ideas?
[00:48:50] <mehrdad_> anyone?
[00:48:59] <mehrdad_> i can't fathom why
[00:53:43] <m0sphere`> http://pastebin.com/qZsWtaeA why won't clicking the cancelbtn set display:none but it will put the borders around the cancelbtn and parent?
[00:56:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: im doing some java stuff myself. you see updates?
[00:57:21] <grafi> looking now
[00:57:42] <grafi> hm i wonder if we can make an example page accessible via github :o
[00:57:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[00:57:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> mind looking into it if you have time
[00:57:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> im a bit tied right now
[00:58:24] <mehrdad_> is there some fuckin weird caveat with using Draggable with buttons?
[00:58:39] <grafi> will do, should work with the pages feature, somehow :P
[00:58:48] <grafi> lets hope github has good documentation
[00:58:49] <grafi> :P
[00:58:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol

[00:59:30] <grafi> is see, you also added some transitions
[00:59:37] <grafi> very slick
[00:59:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya, basica transtions
[01:00:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic
[01:00:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wanted to add soem stuff for the inputs
[01:00:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the placeholder color changing is
[01:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> not standard
[01:02:18] <mehrdad_> mother fuckers
[01:02:21] <mehrdad_> not you
[01:02:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:02:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: scare me there for a se
[01:02:37] <mehrdad_> why the fuck doesn't it work reliably?
[01:02:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> *sec
[01:02:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> you tell me
[01:03:04] <mehrdad_> one time it works , next it doesn't
[01:03:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i need to work on styling custom radio buttons which is gonna be tricky
[01:03:18] <grafi> ^^
[01:03:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: when in doubt rewrite
[01:03:35] <mehrdad_> i mean what the huge fuck, i just put a console.log and it works
[01:03:45] <mehrdad_> completely fuckin unrelated
[01:04:06] <mehrdad_> is Draggable a piece of shit?
[01:04:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: empty cache
[01:04:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> just to be on safe side
[01:05:04] <mehrdad_> i don't get that, ctrl + f5 doesn't read from cache
[01:05:19] <mehrdad_> :(
[01:05:39] <mehrdad_> developers tools = off  = no console = draggable doesn't drop buttton
[01:05:42] <mehrdad_> omfg
[01:06:07] <mehrdad_> give me a fuckin break computers
[01:06:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:07:10] <mehrdad_> i wish i could lol as well
[01:07:25] <mehrdad_> it's unlolable now
[01:09:08] <mehrdad_> get this, on firefox draggable works like a ...
[01:09:12] <mehrdad_> piece of crap
[01:09:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[01:09:20] <mehrdad_> i.e , it doesn't drop at all
[01:09:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that is why i use chrome
[01:09:30] <mehrdad_> on IE, it works sometimes
[01:09:48] <mehrdad_> that's not sensible though is it
[01:09:51] <mehrdad_> it's jquery ffs
[01:09:54] <mehrdad_> cross browser
[01:10:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> it should but it doesnt
[01:10:22] <mehrdad_> any solution?
[01:10:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: that is why i am liking mobile dev more and more
[01:10:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> one standard
[01:10:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> i suggest you dig through documentation
[01:10:42] <mehrdad_> nothing there
[01:10:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery ui draggabbles?
[01:10:51] <NeogeneEpoch> ctrl-alt-del
[01:10:54] <mehrdad_> as one would expect from a cross browser api
[01:11:01] <mehrdad_> yes
[01:11:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> what version of jquery and jquery ui
[01:11:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: are you using 2.X
[01:12:10] <mehrdad_> jquery 1.9 , ui 10
[01:12:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have migrate plugin attached?
[01:12:56] <mehrdad_> my head is nearly exploding with all this messy programming
[01:12:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> move to jquery 1.10.2 and ui 1.8.5
[01:13:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> if that doesnt work
[01:13:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> or ui 1.8.9
[01:13:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how sit looking?
[01:13:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> *hows
[01:13:26] <mehrdad_> you sure?
[01:13:30] <mehrdad_> no jquery 2 ?
[01:13:53] <grafi> dont yet see pages ^^
[01:14:52] <grafi> "Tip: After the first push, it can take up to ten minutes before the content is available." lets wait ^^
[01:15:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: trust 1.10.2 is fine
[01:15:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol
[01:15:51] <grafi> ^^
[01:16:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: did it work
[01:16:28] <mehrdad_> i just put jquery 2 in place for the heck of it, and now it says $ undefined , why?
[01:16:38] <mehrdad_> IE9
[01:16:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> placement of script vs library
[01:16:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh
[01:16:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:16:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> 2 doesnt support <ie8
[01:17:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> and i suspect has issues with ie9 as a result
[01:17:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: use 1.10.2
[01:17:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> trust
[01:17:24] <grafi> fuck ie ^^
[01:17:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what did they mean by that tip?
[01:17:28] <mehrdad_> really? issues with ie9? weird...
[01:17:32] <mehrdad_> ok
[01:17:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i would like to say that too but that is not the case right?
[01:17:45] <grafi> that the content wont be accessible instantly
[01:17:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: you didnt understand
[01:18:00] <mehrdad_> so jquery ui 1.10.2 ?
[01:18:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> *jquery 2.x GOT RID  of <ie8 support*
[01:18:14] <grafi> im afk for a bit, grocery shopping :p
[01:18:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[01:18:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: use juqery 1.10.2 and ui 1.8.5/1.8.9
[01:18:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol
[01:18:45] <mehrdad_> ok
[01:18:50] <mehrdad_> worth a shot
[01:19:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:19:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i actually create my own ui stuff now
[01:20:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> or use external plugins when needed
[01:20:22] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui http://jqueryui.com/download/
[01:20:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know you can downlaod what you need but still
[01:20:51] <mehrdad_> i sense the solution isn't that
[01:20:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont like it
[01:20:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think its messy
[01:21:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think its firefox
[01:21:08] <mehrdad_> no version 1.8 of ui
[01:21:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> what version?
[01:21:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> there is
[01:21:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: jsfiddle.net
[01:21:30] <mehrdad_> what
[01:21:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> switch js library to 1.10.2
[01:21:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you will see option for 1.8.5
[01:21:44] <mehrdad_> no, i mean for downloading
[01:21:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> try 1.8.9 in that case
[01:22:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: add the following line: <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.5/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[01:23:19] <mehrdad_> no
[01:23:30] <mehrdad_> that can't be the solution
[01:23:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> no it did work or no you are stupid rohan
[01:23:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh okay
[01:23:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> try 1.8.9?
[01:23:46] <mehrdad_> the ui site lists the up to date version
[01:23:51] <mehrdad_> same with qquery
[01:23:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know
[01:24:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> im checking legacy version if they work
[01:24:07] <mehrdad_> why revert to olders versions on new browsers?
[01:24:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> some of these are most stable with jquery 1.10.2
[01:24:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^^ thats why
[01:24:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[01:24:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> try latest
[01:24:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think its ui 1.10.3
[01:24:33] <mehrdad_> i have
[01:24:36] <mehrdad_> yes
[01:24:43] <mehrdad_> and jquery 2.0
[01:24:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> and
[01:24:48] <mehrdad_> with IE /9/
[01:24:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> try 1.10.2
[01:24:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> juqery
[01:25:02] <mehrdad_> so i don't see how this is a problem of versions
[01:25:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> and jquery ui 1.101.3
[01:25:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> *1.10.3
[01:25:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was trying to isolate that
[01:25:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think it has to do with how various browsers handle draggables
[01:26:08] <mehrdad_> omfg
[01:26:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: are you geting any errors in console
[01:26:22] <mehrdad_> can you believe it, on firefox it doesn't work at all
[01:26:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[01:26:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> try the main site and see if it works
[01:27:26] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui in firefox console= [12:56:30.461] Unknown property 'box-sizing'.  Declaration dropped.
[01:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> thas just a warning right
[01:27:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> or error
[01:27:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay do me a favour
[01:27:56] <mehrdad_> it hasn't to do with draggable though does it?
[01:28:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> try the demos on jquery ui site
[01:28:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> and see if it works
[01:28:06] <mehrdad_> in IE, no error
[01:28:12] <mehrdad_> ok
[01:28:24] <mehrdad_> i tried it with ie before and it worked
[01:28:26] <mehrdad_> now with ff
[01:29:19] <mehrdad_> it does, as expected
[01:29:45] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem here: if you go to https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm press VM, then say Win 2008, and then click on "Details" text to open a jQuery UI dialog, then close it, reopen and repeat few times - eventually it starts to get stuck, leaving parts of the dialog open - why is that happening?
[01:30:02] <mehrdad_> but that's using default options
[01:30:14] <mehrdad_> i have customized the options Rohan_Bhangui
[01:30:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[01:30:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> try jquery 1.9.1
[01:30:55] <mehrdad_> fuck ff
[01:30:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> with ui 1.10.3
[01:31:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> just to make sure
[01:31:10] <mehrdad_> can you explain how an open console makes it work?
[01:31:14] <mehrdad_> can ANYONE?
[01:31:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> wnat to make sure its all same parameters
[01:31:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> befoer we go digging
[01:31:23] <mehrdad_> ok
[01:31:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> so go use jqeury 1.9.1
[01:31:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> and ui 1.10.3
[01:31:55] <mehrdad_> one minute
[01:32:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> yh
[01:32:24] <mehrdad_> where get it?
[01:32:42] <mehrdad_> okay, just saw
[01:34:12] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui no go :(
[01:34:16] <mehrdad_> same as before
[01:34:27] <mehrdad_> while console is open, the button can be dropped
[01:34:35] <mehrdad_> otherwise , it gets removed
[01:34:37] <mehrdad_> no dropping
[01:34:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[01:34:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> what extra stuff you added
[01:34:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> you mod anything in libraries
[01:36:30] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui http://codepaste.net/fw8yko
[01:36:59] <Serdar> which Tab plugin is the most stable one?
[01:37:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: that is a mod you made to library?
[01:37:17] <mehrdad_> it's just the options
[01:37:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[01:37:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> why do you need those options?
[01:37:43] <mehrdad_> if i remove console.log(elem) button doesn't drop
[01:37:54] <mehrdad_> because i need it for my case?
[01:38:02] <mehrdad_> what's wrong with them?
[01:38:07] <mehrdad_> unusual stuff?
[01:38:29] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui ha, it worked :P
[01:38:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ????
[01:38:52] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui anything wrong with them?
[01:38:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: i am just curious
[01:39:16] <mehrdad_> point is, it's not non standard code
[01:39:20] <mehrdad_> just pure js
[01:39:21] <grafi> i forked your repo, and fiddled around on my copy of the repo, no on to bringing it to our "main" i suppose i could just make a pull request oô
[01:39:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[01:39:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> your a collab so
[01:40:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: i am not an expert at jquery ui but i suspect that there is a mix up since your using half qjeury and half js
[01:40:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what are you doing?
[01:41:05] <mehrdad_> but isn't jquery just js?
[01:41:15] <mehrdad_> i thought that's completely alright
[01:41:23] <Serdar> what is similar to modal dialog but not modal?
[01:41:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> Serdar: dialog??
[01:41:47] <Serdar> to not block what is behind
[01:41:48] <mehrdad_> so can you please tell me the alternatives to those js code in jquery ?
[01:41:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: i said I *suspect*, they are the same but that is my guess
[01:42:02] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui well i should be able to push right to your repo too though shouldnt I?
[01:42:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[01:42:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> go ahead push
[01:42:25] <seutje> default dialog doesn't block, does it?
[01:42:43] <seutje> only if you use modal: true
[01:42:45] <Serdar> Rohan_Bhangui, because I read that modal dialog is evil
[01:42:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> creat your own?
[01:43:39] <seutje> oh, ok, you read it
[01:44:15] <Serdar> my own dialog?
[01:44:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure why not?
[01:45:04] <doug65536> Serdar: don't believe every superstition you read
[01:45:05] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui ?
[01:45:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: dunno...im out of ideas...as i said before i dont have much xp with jquery ui
[01:45:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> *EXP
[01:45:59] <mehrdad_> oh well, thanks anyway
[01:46:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> your showing me a small snippet for toher people to also help
[01:46:15] <Serdar> doug65536, http://stackoverflow.com/a/361684 this sounds reasonable
[01:46:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> your gonna need to reveal more code
[01:46:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> and tell us how to replciate your errors
[01:46:44] <mehrdad_> well that's basically all i have on document.ready
[01:47:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: any luck?
[01:47:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> im a bit confused why it isnt working either
[01:47:33] <doug65536> Serdar: so? first off, it's a mistake to take stackoverflow as an authority. second, the entire point of a modal is forcing the user to answer and blocking use of the rest of the page, so his point is foolishness
[01:47:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> mehrdad_: seems straight forward but ff is having issues
[01:48:13] <mehrdad_> ie too, with buttons
[01:48:15] <Serdar> doug65536, than modal is not what I am looking for, expect for the login.
[01:48:27] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui well the branch is there, so the pages should appear in a bit
[01:48:31] <doug65536> Serdar: you seem to be confusing a *real* modal dialog, like confirm, and a faked modal, like jquery ui. which one are you talking about?
[01:48:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i see 2 branches
[01:48:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> not the branche itself though
[01:48:57] <Serdar> doug65536, I am using the jquery one
[01:49:30] <mehrdad_> Rohan_Bhangui what's boggling my mind is this:
[01:49:33] <Serdar> aaah
[01:49:34] <doug65536> Serdar: the "evil" he refers to is the real modal, confirm. He says "In the most common implementation, this means you can't access any other windows."
[01:49:36] <Serdar> modal: false
[01:49:38] <Serdar> that's it
[01:49:48] <doug65536> Serdar: he isn't talking about jquery ui modal
[01:49:49] <Serdar> wah
[01:50:03] <mehrdad_> closing IE developer tools makes button undroppable
[01:50:20] <mehrdad_> how they are related, i can't figure out
[01:50:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it possible when devloper tools something is being injected into page
[01:51:48] <Serdar> doug65536, I was looking in one direction and couldn't see that modal: false is the solution for my problem
[01:51:58] <grafi> ie devtools are probably terrible xD my ie always crashes with devtools open
[01:52:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> they have actually become quitegood
[01:52:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> what sort of shitty system you have grafi :P ?
[01:52:32] <grafi> win7 on a laptop
[01:52:36] <grafi> nothing fancy
[01:52:45] <grafi> but also nothing too ancient ^^
[01:53:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:58:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb brafi
[01:58:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *grafi
[01:59:03] <xqo> how do you type <>?
[01:59:15] <xqo> var x = "<"+Nick+">" is what i want
[01:59:20] <xqo> but the <> disappear
[02:00:18] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui boing http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[02:00:47] <mehrdad_> i think i have to checkout #jaavasceipt

[02:02:40] <grafi> xqo &lt; &gt;
[02:02:56] <xqo> grafi thanks
[02:10:46] <veloek> Could anyone review my plugin and tell me if this is a bad idea and if so, how it may be done in a more "right" way: https://github.com/veloek/jquery.if-else
[02:13:09] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem here: if you go to https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm press VM, then say Win 2008, and then click on "Details" text to open a jQuery UI dialog, then close it, reopen and repeat few times - eventually it starts to get stuck, leaving parts of the dialog open - why is that happening?
[02:13:55] <grafi> veloek thats sounds very useful to me :o
[02:21:23] <veloek> grafi: Thanks. I would really like to see something like this built into jQuery, but I want to be sure it's done right before I start thinking about making a pull request.
[02:23:25] <HexSquid> Veloek that looks pretty cool
[02:24:03] <HexSquid> Does it nest?
[02:25:44] <veloek> HexSquid: Yeah it should. You mean like: $(sel).if().else().fi().if().else().fi() right?
[02:26:28] <veloek> Or $(sel).if().else().if().else().fi().fi() ?
[02:26:46] <midori-rus> any body know any plugin for horizontal menu, which hides extra items to subsection? like this http://gyazo.com/a792a60af96fbe3528b3dcb5e5d381fc
[02:27:15] <HexSquid> $(e).if(cond).if(cond2).thing().fi().thing().  errgh
[02:27:42] <HexSquid> Not quite sure why I wouldn't just use regular if / else
[02:30:03] <veloek> HexSquid: It has a benefit over regular if/else in that you don't have to break the chain to do the check.
[02:30:15] <grafi> yeah
[02:30:33] <veloek> I will take a look at making it work with chaining if's
[02:30:37] <grafi> :P
[02:31:30] <grafi> veloek I like it, I will definately find use for it ;)
[02:31:40] <veloek> :)
[02:40:10] <seutje> veloek: you fi() method is essentially a less flexible end()
[02:42:32] <seutje> also, this seems weird: return this === $undef ? orig : $undef;
[02:42:45] <seutje> js> print(jQuery() === jQuery())
[02:42:49] <b-ot> seutje: No output.
[02:42:50] <veloek> The plugin is now updated to support nesting
[02:43:11] <seutje> anyway, point is, an empty jQuery collection will never be equal to another empty jQuery collection
[02:43:12] <veloek> jquery() !== jquery() because that created two (unequal) objects.
[02:43:44] <seutje> yeah, so return this === $undef ? orig : $undef; will never ever return orig
[02:43:55] <veloek> var obj = jQuery(); obj === obj
[02:44:07] <veloek> Yes, it will
[02:44:11] <seutje> oh yeah, it's  a reference to the same obj
[02:44:16] <veloek> Yup
[02:45:23] <doug65536> seutje: on a site note, NaN === NaN is false
[02:45:50] <doug65536> oops. wrong person
[02:47:21] <Cork> js> print({} == {})
[02:47:30] <b-ot> Cork: false
[03:01:32] <nights> ok, this is getting annoying so im going to ask
[03:01:44] <nights> im making my own <select>
[03:02:00] <nights> and on pressing one of its options
[03:02:16] <nights> i want to add selected for that option
[03:02:19] <nights> $(this).attr("selected", true);
[03:02:32] <Cork> ?api prop
[03:02:32] <b-ot> Cork: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[03:02:44] <Cork> nights: attr is for attributes not properties
[03:02:48] <nights> hm
[03:02:50] <nights> yes
[03:02:58] <nights> ive read a lot of definitions of the differences
[03:03:20] <nights> but
[03:03:23] <nights> prop doesnt work
[03:03:34] <nights> although i also believe it should be pop
[03:03:35] <Cork> what is "this" in this case?
[03:04:03] <nights> a div
[03:04:13] <Cork> div's don't have a property selected
[03:04:19] <nights> yes
[03:04:23] <nights> so its a custom property
[03:04:26] <Cork> no
[03:04:42] <Cork> if you want to store custom things you should use data- or .data()
[03:04:47] <nights> hm i tried data
[03:04:49] <nights> but it also doesnt work
[03:04:55] <seutje> did you mean $(this).find('input').prop('selected', true)?
[03:05:07] <ignus> Hi I have a question, I have a div#draw where the user can draw boxes by clicking and dragging the mouse. every box that gets rendered is .draggable and resizable on a 20x20 grid. The problem is that I don't know how to "initialize" the grid at top:0 left:0 of the div#area, right now the grid gets initialized wherever the box gets rendered so if it
[03:05:08] <ignus> 's in the middle of the grid (let's say at 10,10) it snaps from that point on, on pixels 30, 50, 70 etc (instead of 0, 20, 40, 60)
[03:05:11] <nights> seutje: no
[03:05:12] <Cork> seutje: don't use "doesn't work" as a definition
[03:05:15] <seutje> deeerp, option, not input
[03:05:15] <Cork> opps
[03:05:18] <Cork> nights: ^
[03:05:23] <nights> seutje: all of it is divs
[03:05:26] <Cork> nights: it doesn't mean anything
[03:05:29] <nights> $('#timecomp_minute').attr( "value", $(this).attr("value") );
[03:05:31] <nights> this works
[03:05:33] <grafi> if your doing your own "select" i think you should have a real select you can set properties on ;)
[03:05:37] <Cork> ...
[03:05:37] <nights> although a div doesnt have "value"
[03:05:52] <Cork> nights: don't use unprefixed custom values on an element
[03:05:52] <seutje> nights: so you are recreating native behaviour?
[03:06:01] <seutje> break all the webs!
[03:06:03] <nights> sort of
[03:06:13] <seutje> I will have no part in this, sorry
[03:06:27] <nights> but as im not using anything other than divs and js i dont see how it will break anything
[03:06:35] <nights> maybe you are right
[03:06:42] <nights> but so far it works fine
[03:07:03] <Cork> nights: and what happens if the browsers in a little while want to add selected on divs?
[03:07:07] <Cork> or value
[03:07:15] <nights> why would it want to do that?
[03:07:16] <nights> :S
[03:07:16] <Cork> nights: data- is used for custom values
[03:07:17] <Cork> use it
[03:07:28] <nights> maybe data doesnt work because selected is reserverd?
[03:07:29] <nights> reserved
[03:07:31] <Cork> nights: it is for the standards to decide
[03:07:49] <Cork> nights: all values outside of data- is reserved for the browser
[03:07:55] <Cork> data- is reserved for websites
[03:08:13] <Cork> just so you don't get name conflicts
[03:08:20] <Cork> and YES it is a BIG problem on the web
[03:08:23] <seutje> be sure to let a blind person decide if it works fine :D
[03:08:28] <nights> hm
[03:08:29] <nights> ok
[03:08:32] <nights> but data doesnt work
[03:08:35] <nights> $(this).data("highlight", 1);
[03:08:35] <Cork> they have been forced to back out changes over and over cause of sites using stupid names
[03:09:00] <Cork> nights: you might want to use attr('data-highlight', 1) if you want it actually attached in the dom
[03:09:04] <nights> i dont to purposely break html
[03:09:07] <grafi> seutje have you never tried some graphical representation of a select oô
[03:09:12] <Cork> .data() just associates it
[03:09:18] <grafi> just because it looks better than the original?
[03:09:41] <Cork> grafi: 90%+ of them are broken though
[03:09:43] <grafi> seutje or something like chosn
[03:09:50] <grafi> Cork sure
[03:09:56] <nights> Cork: i see, so it didnt work because the word was reserved..
[03:10:04] <Cork> nights: no
[03:10:12] <seutje> grafi: only as... a graphical representation of a satellite element that is still accessible... and then I still do it reluctantly
[03:10:42] <grafi> i'd imagine that would be how chosen works ...
[03:10:49] <seutje> if only inputs supported proper pseudos, I'd prolly stick it entirely in the CSS
[03:10:57] <grafi> styling selects is just way too hard
[03:10:58] <nights> Cork: but with "selected" the result is different from "highlight"
[03:11:00] <grafi> :p
[03:11:04] <Cork> nights: though if you go into this area, remember to cater for all the areas you most likely broke: special design for mobile, accessibility for users that don't see
[03:11:11] <Cork> keyboard navigation
[03:11:19] <Cork> and users that don't have a mouse
[03:11:29] <nights> hm yes
[03:11:31] <nights> of course
[03:11:32] <Cork> nights: if you create your own dropdown you have to cater for all of those problems
[03:11:34] <nights> but upside is bigger i think
[03:11:35] <Cork> and it is HARD
[03:11:48] <nights> select is too limited
[03:11:57] <nights> i need custom color for each option
[03:11:58] <Cork> nights: well like i said almost all dropdown replacements fail at this
[03:11:59] <seutje> how many billable hours is it worth?
[03:12:08] <nights> hm
[03:12:12] <nights> maybe 200?
[03:12:13] <Cork> nights: it is really hard to do it right
[03:12:19] <seutje> cause you are taking on a project for life, probably
[03:12:19] <Cork> nights: try a month
[03:12:31] <nights> hm
[03:12:42] <Cork> and then you will still have edge cases you missed
[03:12:46] <nights> what cases will i break besides blind people and keyboard nav?
[03:13:30] <Cork> users that don't 1. no mouse users, 2. no keyboard users, 3. keyboard users, 4. mobile devices, 5. users that don't see but hear what is on the web
[03:13:32] <Cork> and so on
[03:13:46] <Cork> ?g mdn aria
[03:13:46] <b-ot> Cork: ARIA - Accessibility | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Accessibility/ARIA
[03:14:06] <ignus> Guys, sorry to interrupt but is there anyone who knows how to initialize the grid option for .draggable and .resizable at top:0, left:0 of the container div? Right now the grid get initialized wherever I draw a rectangle
[03:14:18] <Cork> all this you get for free with the native element, don't think it is easy to get that right
[03:14:20] <Cork> cause it isn't
[03:14:21] <nights> 4. mobile devices, what do you mean by this? doesnt touch emulate click anyway?
[03:14:31] <seutje> might also be more interesting to contribute to one of the more tested "solutions"
[03:14:51] <seutje> nights: some mobile devices are heavily speech driven
[03:14:53] <Cork> nights: mobile normally show an overlay cause the dropdowns work REALLY bad on a touch device
[03:15:06] <nights> cork: i understand there is a lot of legacy to implement, but like i said if it works for 99% of my users then the upside win
[03:15:15] <nights> ah
[03:15:19] <Cork> nights: legacy?!?
[03:15:19] <nights> yeah that's true
[03:15:24] <Cork> this is not about legacy at all
[03:15:26] <nights> well
[03:15:27] <nights> not legacy
[03:15:29] <nights> bad word
[03:15:32] <nights> but inheritance
[03:15:36] <nights> or standard
[03:15:38] <nights> or something
[03:15:40] <nights> to implement
[03:15:41] <Cork> compatibility and accessibility
[03:15:45] <seutje> all the words!
[03:15:51] <Cork> actually letting the user use the form
[03:15:57] <nights> there is no form either
[03:15:58] <nights> lo
[03:16:01] <seutje> oh boy
[03:16:02] <Cork> >_<
[03:16:11] <nights> you guys would likely sacrifice me on the altar of html
[03:16:12] <Cork> why not just use <canvas> and be done with it
[03:16:21] <seutje> swf all the things!
[03:16:28] <Cork> nights: the standards are there for a reason
[03:16:35] <nights> would it be a better choice to use <select> and fuck around inside there instead?
[03:16:40] <nights> atleast that wouldnt break as much maybe
[03:16:40] <Cork> cause if you ignore them things break
[03:16:49] <nights> you guys dont understand
[03:16:51] <nights> im not breaking
[03:16:55] <Cork> you are
[03:16:56] <nights> selects will still work
[03:17:02] <nights> but this is a new componenet
[03:17:03] <Cork> if you don't have forms the page is broken
[03:17:04] <nights> component
[03:17:10] <nights> i dont want to call it select
[03:17:13] <nights> although it is similar
[03:17:36] <seutje> that's the problem, it has no real relation to a regular select
[03:17:43] <seutje> the browser doesn't know you are trying to extend it
[03:17:50] <nights> but people invent components all the time
[03:17:52] <seutje> it just see it as a bunch of divs with handlers
[03:18:08] <nights> ill show you an example
[03:18:25] <Cork> don't think you need to i've seen a ton of those
[03:18:31] <nights> http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/ddSlick
[03:18:37] <Cork> and it is always about design before anything else
[03:18:43] <seutje> I was expecting the Bootstrap nightmare
[03:19:00] <nights> Cork: what you say is correct
[03:19:12] <nights> but html doesnt cover what i want to do
[03:19:15] <Cork> nights: meaning == broken by design
[03:19:16] <nights> what are the options?
[03:19:28] <seutje> wow, this thing actually changed the input types
[03:19:32] <Cork> nights: don't break functionality to make it pretty
[03:19:36] <nights> seutje: yes
[03:20:12] <nights> ive used that components with paying customers
[03:20:17] <nights> and had very little complains
[03:20:22] <Cork> nights: if you go into extending functionality do the research on what you need to do to make it work correctly
[03:20:24] <nights> and a lot of happiness
[03:20:43] <nights> Cork: yes. what you said interested me, i do actually want mobile browsers to treat it as a select
[03:20:56] <Cork> nights: customers is the ones that normally don't know the cost
[03:21:03] <nights> but im afraid of going into the territory to call it a select as then i might actually break stuff
[03:21:07] <Cork> nights: it is YOUR job to cater for it
[03:21:31] <Cork> hack you could sell doing everything in canvas, sure only users that do exactly what you expect can use it
[03:21:34] <Cork> but it looks good
[03:21:42] <nights> i mean
[03:21:48] <Cork> looking at a web problem that way is the mean to kill it
[03:22:00] <nights> atleast not calling it a select wont make it mess around with things that i wont implement
[03:22:15] <Cork> cause only the fraction of the web that works exactly as you expect works, everyone else is screwed
[03:22:22] <nights> but if i make it a select, then my feeling is that is more dangerous
[03:23:28] <nights> ill try to change it to a select and see what happens
[03:23:33] * nights blows up
[03:23:40] <intellix> helloooo. I'm using pushstate/history.js and am having issues with history states with an iframe that is loading for a long time
[03:24:20] <intellix> I'm doing History.back(); to go back, but the previous state is still there
[03:30:29] <Anticom> intellix could it be, that you're pushing something on the website you are going back to?
[03:30:54] <Anticom> that's a propblem i experienced when implementing my own history wrapper ;)
[03:31:02] <intellix> well it's the same site. I think it must be something to do with the history wrapper I'm using
[03:31:35] <intellix> I'm seeing a parameter in the wrapper for queueing, setting that to false and thought it was fixed :P seems not as easy as that
[03:32:03] <Anticom> working with browser history seriously sucks^^
[03:32:48] <Anticom> took me ages to get something, that worked at least the most i wanted it to
[03:43:36] <ribot> ¨hi
[03:44:15] <ribot> i have a set of elements $set, and a subset containing some of the elements of $set, called $subset, now how can i select all elements of $set which are not in $subset?
[03:44:21] <intellix> I think........ popstate doesn't work properly in Chrome when an iFrame is loading
[03:45:45] <intellix> my thing works in Firefox, but when using Chrome, pop state isn't removing the history state
[03:46:10] <intellix> yeah working with history states sucks.... I wish I used AngularJS from the start of this project :P
[04:06:40] <nights> Cork: i thought about what you said and i decided to revert back to select, found some hidden css3 gems for it i didnt know about
[04:06:42] <nights> thanks for the advice
[04:07:01] <Cork> np
[04:07:06] <Cork> css3 gems?
[04:08:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: sry that was a long brbr
[04:08:21] <airdem> if i select a file via <input type="file"> will it trigger change() or another function?
[04:08:50] <lintguy> Hello.
[04:08:55] <airdem> Hello.
[04:09:43] <lintguy> I just want to say to Cork, thanks for providing great support on jQuery for so many years and i am very happy to still see that you are active here. That's all, again. Thanks!
[04:10:01] <airdem> Cork needs a medal or smth
[04:10:11] <lintguy> Many.
[04:10:15] <Cork> lintguy: np :)

[04:11:26] <Cork> lolcat huh :)
[04:11:26] <lintguy> If there where a top user board on freenet, Cork would be at the top :)
[04:12:55] <hekin> hi, guys, i found it sometimes the "focus" method is not working on mobile safari
[04:13:11] <hekin> i have to trigger it several times to get the input focused
[04:13:22] <hekin> any idea why it is like that?
[04:14:28] <Cork> hekin: might be the input element vs overlay thingy
[04:14:47] <hekin> Cork: i am not sure what you mean
[04:14:48] <Cork> mobiles puts an overlay over the input element for the user to type in
[04:15:07] <Cork> so there is actually two elements in the page
[04:15:28] <Cork> and then they propagate the events from the overlay to the original input element
[04:15:33] <Cork> and a lot of other messes
[04:15:45] <hekin> ahhh, :D
[04:15:50] <hekin> you enlighten me
[04:15:50] <Cork> it causes some problems, this can sometimes be one of them
[04:16:02] <airdem> have a stupid question. how do i convert $(this) to this again?
[04:16:03] <hekin> any idea how to beat it?
[04:16:08] <Cork> not saying it is the case this time, but likely
[04:16:15] <Cork> airdem: [0]
[04:16:22] <airdem> i got served
[04:16:23] <hekin> @Cork any idea how to fix this issue?
[04:16:34] <lintguy> airdem: Served?
[04:16:35] <Cork> hekin: carefully :)
[04:16:42] <hekin> ?
[04:16:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: Cork is at the top of his game
[04:16:57] <Cork> hekin: i don't remember how you handled it, what i meant with carefully is that it is tricky to make it stable
[04:17:06] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, slow down buddy, he already got a medal.
[04:17:11] <airdem> :)
[04:17:12] <hekin> @Cork: yeah
[04:17:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[04:17:22] <Cork> hekin: i can't give you the solution from the top of my head sorry
[04:17:22] <lintguy> :-D
[04:17:39] <Cork> hekin: there are forum questions about it if you google though
[04:17:39] <hekin> @Cork no worry, you have enlightened me, :)
[04:17:53] <lintguy> airdem: hard to stop loving a jquery knight of the round function
[04:18:48] <hekin> Cork: there's a "touchstart" event

[04:20:23] <lintguy> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6800591
[04:20:32] <lintguy> Cork: Dustin
[04:20:43] <Cork> ah
[04:20:57] <Cork> well i know a few other that does it too
[04:21:04] <Cork> don't really care too much
[04:21:36] <lintguy> There have been a few hacks on other companies, so they should care.
[04:22:08] <lintguy> If it where me running such a large company and storing passwords in text, i'd be embarrassed
[04:23:39] <Cork> lintguy: well they do care, the statement says that quite clearly
[04:24:09] <MalMen>  hello i need to add a value to an object that have expecific value, can anyone take a look please http://jsbin.com/eXETeTu/1/edit
[04:24:10] <Cork> but replacing a data system takes time
[04:24:20] <lintguy> It does indeed.
[04:24:58] <Cork> lintguy: but i consider passwords entered to a site a volatile, so i don't care too much if it is plain text or not
[04:25:04] <lintguy> I wonder what ERP they use
[04:25:22] <Cork> wouldn't supprice me if it is visma or similar
[04:25:55] <lintguy> Cork: Since they store private personal information, it is quite serious to store it badly.
[04:26:23] <Cork> well the answer was about passwords
[04:26:27] <Cork> not about the rest
[04:26:29] <lintguy> Cork: Hm, but Visma haven't had a shop that long
[04:26:40] <Cork> uh
[04:26:49] <Cork> the system i'm talking about is from the 90's
[04:27:07] <Cork> and it was when dustin opened shop
[04:28:40] <lintguy> Cork: Ah.
[04:30:16] <lintguy> Cork: What system specifically? Because i only see one visma

[04:32:51] <lintguy> Cork: So Visma Avendo Webshop then?
[04:33:08] <Cork> lintguy: don't think so, not sure
[04:33:14] <lintguy> Cork: Anyway, if they are changing away from that - it must be a huge undertaking.
[04:33:26] <Cork> that is kinda what i meant :)
[04:33:30] <lintguy> Cork: Visma is not known for having open systems.
[04:33:52] <lintguy> Understood.
[04:34:12] <lintguy> I guess they are changing towards Microsoft Dynamics then.
[04:35:09] <Cork> there is a lot of options today
[04:35:19] <Cork> back then there wasn't really much choice :)
[04:38:15] <lintguy> Well, the front-end can be any language these days.
[04:38:37] <lintguy> So i hope they build the front in-house and uses a proper ERP in the back-end
[04:39:09] <lintguy> I recently built a shop that connects to MS dynamics, it works superbly.
[04:39:15] <lintguy> Even for global sales
[04:39:33] <lintguy> Wouldn't be possible without cloudflare though
[04:40:24] <nights> cork: -webkit-appearance: none; for example
[04:40:28] <nights> not gems maybe
[04:40:39] <nights> but useful and i didnt know about their existance
[04:40:55] <Cork> nights: well ya, don't forget the other prefixes too
[04:41:16] <Cork> (kinda sad that -moz- isn't used for apperance when they where the ones comming up with the idea))
[04:56:49] <fosser_josh> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.  error
[04:57:16] <fosser_josh> On button press this error occoured
[04:57:45] <fosser_josh> while inspecting in chrome its pointing out to the jquery
[04:57:55] <tboerger> hi
[04:58:13] <fosser_josh> anyone know how to tackle this error
[04:58:17] <tboerger> is there anay jquery method to check for a specific query string?
[04:58:24] <shoky> fosser_josh: that's fine. an update to chrome causes it with jquery, it's fixed for jquery 1.11 / 2.1
[04:58:29] <shoky> fosser_josh: ignore it
[04:58:42] <tboerger> i need to find out if "?nopoll" or "?nopoll=1" is appended to the url.
[04:59:05] <fosser_josh> shoky: but its showing pop up undefined
[04:59:27] <shoky> fosser_josh: it doesn't have to do with that warning
[04:59:36] <fosser_josh> k
[05:01:35] <mrchris> Hi All.  I'm been using Jquery UI autocomplete ($('.div').autocomplete({..}))  but now i need more advanced functionality so that I can filter the items by more than one word, e.g. If I type 'Chicken face' then it should bring back 'The Chicken has no face'.   Does anyone have experience with this to send me in the right direction?
[05:11:57] <shoky> mrchris you can do that with jquery ui, using a custom "source" callback
[05:12:54] <Serdar> does anybody got an Idea how to stack jquery.dialog?
[05:13:26] <Serdar> http://www.jonn8.com/fwm/images/screenshots/windows_stacked.jpg like this
[05:27:17] <seutje> Serdar: just open them one after another
[05:28:04] <ghostlines> gafternoon, is it possible to send an ajax request(type GET) with json data that I can later process? or does the request type always have to be post in this case?
[05:30:27] <Serdar> seutje, this does not work, they are covering the old ones
[05:30:44] <shoky> ghostlines you can send json with GET if you really want to, encoded somehow.. will be one ugly url
[05:30:47] <Serdar> I opened 3 and can only see the last one because the others are behind
[05:31:28] <seutje> Serdar: that's where the docs come in handy
[05:31:33] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/ZuW7A/
[05:31:56] <shoky> ghostlines: but there could be limitations on the json length
[05:32:08] <ghostlines> I don't need the url the use won't see it, just the data to process later with a django view
[05:32:17] <ghostlines> ohh k I'll have to go with POST  then thanks
[05:32:36] <seutje> Serdar: should be quicker to cry "it doesn't work" though
[05:32:47] <joroci> pressing Esc will trigger the keypress event?
[05:33:31] <joroci> guess not
[05:34:03] <shoky> joroci nah just keydown/keyup
[05:34:25] <seutje> yeah, just use keyup
[05:34:28] <seutje> 27 is esc iirc
[05:34:36] <seutje> yeah
[05:34:40] <joroci> yea found out the hard way :)
[05:34:47] <Serdar> seutje, what you want to tell me, is that it is not supported out of the box and needs to be done manualy
[05:35:13] <seutje> Serdar: wow, really? I gave you a working example using the *DOCUMENTED* api and you return with this?
[05:35:16] <Serdar> and which is not working on IE11
[05:40:57] <shoky> Serdar: it's working, just not in jsfiddle's iframe with jq2.  http://jsfiddle.net/ZuW7A/show/
[05:40:58] <Serdar> seutje, I didn't want to offend you.
[05:41:42] <Serdar> I was hoping I didn't need to calculate the new position from old
[05:42:30] <Serdar> because this could led to errors if I reach the bottom end of the window
[05:42:45] <seutje> Serdar: looking at the docs really helps http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[05:42:58] <seutje> you'll see it's rather flexible on defining a relative position
[05:43:18] <seutje> you can even position them relative to eachother
[05:43:57] <seutje> my: 'left top', at: 'right bottom', of: referenceToPreviousDialog
[05:57:19] <gianiaz> hi, I0m using jquery+jquery ui in a site, now I want to create an accordion withot style. There's a way to do id?
[05:57:47] <Typos> Hello, anyone know how i can make a countdown to today,s date from a datetime i have in php ?
[05:58:07] <gianiaz> sorry, I'm*, without* do It*
[05:58:23] <gianiaz> Typos, in php do you have a timestamp?
[05:58:46] <Serdar> seutje, I don't get it, is xy[0] == my?
[05:58:48] <Typos> gianiaz in php i have a date from database
[05:59:00] <gianiaz> in wich format?
[05:59:25] <Typos> gianiaz in mysql its "datetime" and in php i call it also with "datetime"
[06:00:41] <Serdar> seutje, err forget the question
[06:02:32] <gianiaz> http://pastebin.com/gpFqQumX
[06:02:35] <gianiaz> Typos,
[06:02:53] <gianiaz> here's the code to convert a mysqltimestamp to a php timestamp
[06:03:11] <gianiaz> php timestamp are the numbers of second from 1st jan 1970
[06:03:25] <gianiaz> javascript uses the same format, but counts milliseconds
[06:04:35] <Typos> gianiaz ok and the js countdown is hard to do ? is there a library for that ? that i see the countdown in real time expiring
[06:05:08] <gianiaz> typos it's very basic, but you have to know a little bit of javascript
[06:05:16] <fabioportieri> hi, i need a plugin or something that can render a 3d partial pie chart.. i'm looking google charts but till now it seems i can't render a partial pie
[06:05:48] <gianiaz> Typos, try looking at this : https://mindgrader.com/tutorials/1-how-to-create-a-simple-javascript-countdown-timer
[06:05:50] <Typos> gianiaz i found this library http://momentjs.com/ is this gona be easier ?
[06:06:35] <gianiaz> Typos, personally I would not choose a library for a task simple like this
[06:11:28] <Typos> can i also disable my website for users that has no javascript enabled ? i don,t want visitors with no javascript enabled
[06:11:48] <seutje> lol
[06:12:05] <seutje> quote for the archives!
[06:12:22] <Bauer> I have a problem here: if you go to https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm press VM, then say Win 2008, and then click on "Details" text to open a jQuery UI dialog, then close it, reopen and repeat few times - eventually it starts to get stuck, leaving parts of the dialog open - why is that happening?
[06:13:27] <Serdar> is it me or does this sounds racist?
[06:14:09] <seutje> dialogs getting stuck doesn't sound all that racist to me
[06:14:36] <Serdar> seutje, I meant Typos message :)
[06:14:56] <Bauer> hehe, he was meaning discriminating no JS users :)
[06:14:58] <fabioportieri> d3.js does partial pie charts, amCharts does 3d pie charts, i want a 3d partial pie chart...
[06:15:12] <Bauer> seutje: any idea why the dialogs are getting stuck?
[06:15:20] <seutje> nosir
[06:15:24] <Typos> Serdar racism would be if i have a script in my website which would check if the user is black or white or even yellow  don't you think ?
[06:15:52] * Bauer would buy a script which checks IQ level, and blocks access :P
[06:16:04] <Typos> Serdar i simply don't want that people see wrong dates and than they will cry becuase some visitors don't know what is javascript and they has it disabled
[06:16:28] <seutje> Bauer: I don't even really know which one is "VM" so I can click it :x
[06:16:42] <Serdar> and they will not cry why then cannot access your website?
[06:16:42] <Bauer> seutje: the yellow one
[06:16:42] <seutje> oh, just noticed lol
[06:16:47] <Bauer> err green seutje
[06:16:56] <seutje> yeah, didn't notice the few characters I can recognize :P
[06:17:00] <FrankDWork> whats the best way to add an arbitrary number of input fields on-demand? (ie user is presented with "Add Another" button)
[06:17:54] <Typos> Serdar my website relies on correct dates its better when they see nothing than incorrect dates.
[06:18:13] <Serdar> why not using php?
[06:18:57] <seutje> Bauer: looks like you have multiple handlers on every details link
[06:19:03] <Typos> Serdar ok another question when my users has disabled javascript how i make that they see php date instead ?
[06:19:10] <FrankDWork> i thought of clone, but the inputs will need unique IDs wont they?
[06:19:28] <seutje> Bauer: are you unbinding and rebinding?
[06:19:29] <shoky> Bauer: the problem is you're re-creating the dialog element each time
[06:19:43] <Bauer> seutje: how do you see that? and no seutje, didnt think of that
[06:19:49] <seutje> clicking a couple times and I'm up to clikc handler 25-26
[06:19:51] <shoky> Bauer: you need to either destroy it and re-create it, or just call .dialog('open') on it after it's closed
[06:19:56] <shoky> Bauer: and hey ;P
[06:20:44] <seutje> Bauer: well, ur using an old version on jQuery, so I can still inspect $.data(element, 'events').click
[06:21:04] <Serdar> Typos, what exactly you need?
[06:21:30] <Serdar> Typos, do you want to know if it is the correct time to begin with?
[06:21:38] <NoiseEee> Typos: you always start with providing the 'current' info (date/time/stats) via backend, then enhance/update on the front-end, thats the theme to follow throughout
[06:21:40] <Serdar> or do you know what time it is on client side?
[06:21:43] <seutje> kinda uncool to make us debug concatenated code though :(
[06:22:10] <shoky> chrome solves that with a click of a button ;p
[06:22:23] <Bauer> seutje: I use $('#vmlevels div').remove(); when switching between sections. but the problem exists even if I dont recreate the dialogs - and only switch between the different dialogs, reading the details
[06:22:46] <Typos> Serdar no forget about times i simply want to know this : if(js is enabled) {show js date}else {show php date}
[06:23:31] <Serdar> you know the difference?
[06:23:42] <shoky> Bauer: the dialog element is moved by jquery, it's no longer where you put it originally
[06:23:52] <Serdar> JS date will be the date on client side, php on server side
[06:23:54] <shoky> Bauer: and to destroy a dialog properly you call .dialog('destroy') on it
[06:26:04] <seutje> Typos: so... just show the php date and replace it with JS
[06:26:14] <seutje> guess what, that doesn't do anything when JS is disabled...
[06:26:29] <seutje> or hell, go all <noscript> crazy!
[06:26:48] <Bauer> shoky: but I dont do any destroy events, only clicking on one Details, reading it, clicking X to close, and clicking another Details (rinse and repeat until it breaks)
[06:26:57] <Bauer> without moving a section which recreates the dialogs
[06:27:49] <shoky> Bauer: ok but you're not destroying the dialog widget, nor removing the dialog element from the DOM
[06:28:16] <shoky> Bauer: then you end up having two elements with the same ID
[06:28:37] <seutje> Bauer: this happens on every click of the details thingy: function CreateDialogPopup(ItemID,DomData){$('#'+ItemID).after(DomData);$('#'+ItemID+'-PopUp').dialog({closeOnEscape:true});}
[06:29:00] <seutje> looks to me it does some shuffling in the DOM
[06:29:16] <shoky> the .dialog call moves it elsewhere
[06:29:27] <seutje> it also does this on every click: function (){$('#'+DescID).dialog("option","closeOnEscape");}  which... is setting the same option? o.O
[06:29:37] <shoky> it's not really setting anything :P
[06:29:45] <seutje> oh, descID vs itemID...
[06:29:48] <seutje> them scopes...
[06:31:54] <Bauer> one sec, let me paste the relevant function in jsfiddle, I fail to see the problem
[06:33:49] <Bauer> here: http://jsfiddle.net/PV985/ hmmm as I read it I understood I think - line 11 is essentially a duplicate line causing the problems?
[06:34:06] <shoky> line 11 is not doing anything
[06:34:18] <shoky> you're calling it as a getter, not a setter
[06:37:02] <seutje> Bauer: also, $('#foo').click(function() { $('#foo').doSomething(); }); is a bit silly, and in some cases error-prone
[06:37:14] <seutje> "this" usually references the element that was clicked
[06:37:24] <seutje> so $('#foo').click(function() { $(this).doSomething(); });
[06:37:58] <seutje> if it were a class with multiple occurrences, you'd be triggering them all by clicking only 1 trigger
[06:41:16] <shoky> Bauer: line 12 also doesn't make sense. again you're callling it as as a getter, and also $('#'+DescID)  is not even a dialog
[06:42:20] <Bauer> one sec, I am trying to fix things :)
[06:42:26] <Bauer> its a bit messy, yeah lol
[06:43:13] <daveaway> im having problems removing the ui-draggable class
[06:43:31] <daveaway> using jqueryUI, is there a specific way to remove the draggable/resizable attR?
[06:44:29] <shoky> .draggable('destroy') ?
[06:47:45] <Bauer> seutje, shoky: I remembered why I recreate it all the time: because damn jquery removes the original popup and never "returns" it back :D
[06:47:54] <Bauer> once you close the dialog, the content is gone
[06:47:59] <shoky> it's not gone
[06:48:03] <shoky> it's just moved
[06:48:08] <shoky> you don't have to recreate it
[06:48:24] <shoky> just call .dialog('open') on it after it's closed
[06:48:30] <Bauer> moved where? the "DEtails" button disappears
[06:48:42] <shoky> well, you've changed it now
[06:48:48] <shoky> you're doing .dialog on the "Details" button
[06:48:54] <Bauer> one min, I will post a new code, cleaner.. one min
[06:48:54] <shoky> is that what you want? ;p
[06:49:32] <Bauer> no, the goal is to pop up some content when that button is clicked
[06:50:00] <shoky> right, so the way you had it before was better
[06:50:13] <shoky> calling .dialog on the -Popup element, not on the details button
[06:50:19] <Bauer> yup, I started changing until I realized why it was so messy :)
[06:50:23] <Bauer> I forgot since last night
[06:50:50] <shoky> remove the first  $('#' + DescID).bind("click", function() {..
[06:53:18] <shoky> ok, now in CreateDialogPopup do:  if (  $('#' + ItemID + '-PopUp').length ) {   $('#' + ItemID + '-PopUp').dialog('open');   } else {  $('#' + ItemID).after(DomData);  $('#' + ItemID + '-PopUp').dialog({closeOnEscape: true});   }
[06:53:19] <Bauer> done shoky, but its still buggy.. sec I paste newer code
[06:54:02] <Bauer> shoky: this is current version: http://jsfiddle.net/PV985/1/
[06:54:17] <shoky> i'm looking at your site anyways
[06:54:26] <shoky> try making the last change i showed
[06:54:30] <Bauer> hmmm, what would .length check? yeah but you see it minified if I am not mistaken
[06:54:43] <shoky> it checks if the element already exists in the DOM
[06:55:00] <shoky> if the .length is not 0
[06:55:16] <Bauer> hmm, wouldnt that solution double open the dialog?
[06:56:11] <shoky> mm nope. and calling 'open' on an open dialog doesn't do anything anyway
[06:56:32] <shoky> how you had it before was trying to double open it
[06:57:34] <shoky> o and your code on the site isn't minified, just the whitespace is removed. chrome has a button in the devtools to "pretty print" so no problem ;p
[06:58:24] <Bauer> where is that button? :o
[06:58:44] <shoky> Bauer oh i see now you're creating all the Popup elements before clicking Details ?
[06:59:02] <shoky> Bauer: in the Sources tab on the bottom, the { }  button
[06:59:38] <Bauer> thanks, never noticed it hehe :) hmm sec
[06:59:46] <shoky> Bauer: remove the line:   $('#' + Item.Level).after(DomData);
[06:59:57] <shoky> Bauer: from ShowPriceForCloudOptions
[07:00:31] <shoky> Bauer: er the last one i mean
[07:01:17] <Bauer> it seems good now shoky! that was the faulty line which created duplicates :P
[07:01:53] <shoky> cool ;p
[07:02:11] <Bauer> thanks, again :) all that left is to reposition the dialog better, and another guy will style the Details thing :)
[07:02:43] <shoky> np ;]
[07:03:01] <hfp> Hi all! I'm a bit confused about the .dialog() method and its modal option. Am I supposed to set something specific on the css for the modal overlay to show?
[07:03:03] <hugo_m> if you have an iframe added to the body, and the iframe is a lot smaller than the body and is centered, how can i disable touchmove on the iPhone when someone places their finger on the area outside the iframe (on the body)?  I've tried to add event handlers for touch move on the body, but it seems that the context is the iframe?
[07:03:23] <shoky> hfp: nope
[07:03:35] <hugo_m> when i place my fingers on the area outside the iframe, the touch move handler is never fired
[07:04:20] <hfp> shoky: so I just do $('selector').dialog({modal: true}); and the page should be overlaid?
[07:05:03] <Bauer> yes hfp, but I think you will need the jquery UI CSS parts for this
[07:05:26] <hfp> Bauer: Oh... Could you expand on that please?
[07:05:33] <shoky> hfp: yep  http://jsfiddle.net/4q9JC/
[07:05:52] <seutje> but u added the jQuery UI css
[07:05:55] <seutje> cheats!
[07:06:02] <shoky> lulz
[07:06:33] <seutje> fun fact: lul is dutch slang for male genitalia
[07:06:54] <shoky> i'm dancing with joy
[07:07:04] <seutje> so you might wanna check your motivations when "doing it for the lulz"
[07:07:09] <hugo_m> shoky: any idea?
[07:07:28] <shoky> hugo_m: no idea about iphone stuff sry
[07:08:31] <FrankDWork> how can I iterate through the children of a div to rename their ID? Ie to change "InputXYZCloneable" to "InputXYZ" + n
[07:10:24] <shoky> FrankDWork: here's one way:  $('div').children().prop('id', function(i, id) { return id.replace(/Cloneable/,'') })
[07:14:02] <xtristan> Greetings all.  I was hoping to get some help with jquery and getting values from an input box.  I'm using the method as per the jquery docs (box.val()), but this is returning an error.  I think this is because I'm trying to access the DOM by tree indice.  http://jsfiddle.net/8xW54/1/  Can someone point me in the right direction?
[07:16:35] <FrankDWork> shoky, great thanks
[07:18:10] <shoky> xtristan: use .eq(0) instead of [0] if you want a jquery object
[07:18:27] <FrankDWork> that worked wonderfully for the IDs -- is there an easy way to correct those for the "for" attribute in a label tag as well?
[07:18:45] <shoky> xtristan: then you can call .val() on it. alternatively you can do ...[0].value = whatever;
[07:19:01] <xtristan> shoky, yep! just tested your suggestion.  works perfectly.  thank you so much
[07:19:28] <shoky> FrankDWork: sure, change 'prop' to 'attr'  and 'id' to 'for' :P  (except don't name the variable for cause js won't allow it ;p)
[07:19:36] <Bauer> shoky: now tried playing with the position property, but getting jquery UI errors, when adding this: position: { my: "left top", at: "left bottom", of: "button" } and different with just button like in docs example...
[07:19:58] <FrankDWork> ahh ok, i have to look up prop/attr now
[07:19:59] <FrankDWork> thanks a lot shoky
[07:21:42] <shoky> Bauer: well, you don't have any button :P
[07:28:20] <limpc> hi guys
[07:28:49] <limpc> im trying to implement drag/drop uploading from web sources to my page.  it seems to work if i drag/drop urls, but not when i try to drop images
[07:29:07] <limpc> the 'drop' event doesnt appear to fire.  is there another way im supposed to be doing this for image drops?
[07:29:22] <Bauer> shoky: thanks, solved that one :P final remaining problem: how do I subscribe to some event, to close a popup when user clicks anywhere outside the dialog?
[07:29:33] <Bauer> I dont know of such event
[07:30:36] <myosotis> Bauer, if you are using a modal popup, you should be able to capture a click event on the overlay element
[07:31:01] <Bauer> myosotis: I dont use modal dialog, but  a normal one
[07:31:20] <FrankDWork> argh
[07:31:31] <myosotis> if you want to close the dialog when the user clicks off of it
[07:31:36] <myosotis> perhaps you should use a modal instead
[07:31:40] <FrankDWork> somehow i broke autocomplete :\
[07:31:46] <myosotis> because that's precisely the use case it's designed for
[07:31:53] <shoky> Bauer: you can set a click handler on $(document), and also set one on the dialog element in which you call event.stopPropagation() on te event argument, so clicks inside the dialog don't bubble up to the document
[07:32:04] <shoky> Bauer: or yeah, myosotis has a point
[07:32:56] <Bauer> only as a last resort shoky, I dont want to fade out the rest of the site
[07:33:06] <FrankDWork> if i clone a div/element is there anything else I have to do? it seems that autocomplete broke around the time I started doing that
[07:33:09] <myosotis> Bauer, style the overlay to be complete transparent
[07:33:13] <shoky> Bauer: you can set the overlay's css however you want
[07:33:45] <Bauer> hm, thats an idea :)
[07:33:56] <myosotis> This solution is much cleaner and easier to understand / maintain than not using an overlay between the content and the dialog
[07:35:37] <FrankDWork> http://pastebin.com/ERQ7kV5b
[07:35:43] <FrankDWork> is there any reason autocomplete should be broken there?
[07:35:44] <fabioportieri> can anyone suggest a plugin for generating a 3d partial pie chart?
[07:36:09] <FrankDWork> it worked fine before I started re-writing the ids for the cloned input fields
[07:36:12] <shoky> FrankDWork: didn't see your paste yet, but about your question - you can't clone a jquery-ui widget usually and expect it to work
[07:36:16] <FrankDWork> the classes look OK on them though
[07:36:46] <FrankDWork> eek :(
[07:37:32] <FrankDWork> if I apply the ui-widget class after its cloned would it work?
[07:37:40] <Bauer> myosotis: how do I hook up to a click on the modal overlay? API doesnt say
[07:37:47] <FrankDWork> or is there something i can trigger to get it to re-do the ui-widget magic?
[07:38:37] <shoky> FrankDWork: you can clone the input (which doesnt have the jquery-ui widget initialized yet)  and call .autocomplete on it to initialize it
[07:41:37] <shoky> Bauer: it has a "ui-widget-overlay" class so $(".ui-widget-overlay").click(...) would do it. or maybe better to use event delegation so you don't have to worry if the overlay exists yet or not, e.g.  $(document).on('click', '.ui-widget-overlay', function(){ ... })
[07:42:22] <JonathanNeal> I see the "example.com" part of the URL "http://example.com/awesome" referred to as the host or host name, but the "example.com" part of the email "awesome@example.com" referred to as the domain - why is that? And aren't they both the host?
[07:43:36] <limpc> im trying to implement drag/drop uploading from web sources to my page.  it seems to work if i drag/drop urls, but not when i try to drop images.  the 'drop' event doesnt appear to fire.  is there another way im supposed to be doing this for image drops?
[07:43:52] <krambiorix> hi, i have a page with some divs with class "bookmark" in it... How can i check if a bookmark div appeared in the viewport?
[07:44:07] <limpc> $('.bookmark')
[07:44:34] <joeseph> Hey guys, I'm looking for a plugin or code that is a visual confirmation for a user that an ajax call was made.  It needs to work well on mobile.  Ideas?
[07:44:57] <limpc> joeseph: just use confirm()?
[07:45:27] <shoky> confirm("An ajax call was made. Are you pleased?")
[07:45:35] <limpc> yeah
[07:45:50] <shoky> yeah, not really
[07:46:07] <joeseph> I'll take a look, but I think I want something less obtrusive to the flow of the user.
[07:46:08] <limpc> well then give more info. because that fits your need as described
[07:46:25] <krambiorix> limpc, you didn't understand my question
[07:46:33] <krambiorix> i mean when scrolling
[07:46:46] <limpc> shoky: er.. not yours.. joeseph's :)
[07:47:17] <FrankDWork> shoky, hmm I tried $('#dest' + newNum).autocomplete;  and no change
[07:47:32] <FrankDWork> also tried adding ui-widget class after cloning, no change in behavior
[07:47:42] <limpc> joeseph: less obtrusive.. jquery has its own dialog which does work on mobile.
[07:47:50] <shoky> FrankDWork: the class won't help.. make a jsfiddle and we can fiddle with it
[07:48:44] <joeseph> limpc: I've got checkboxes that a user clicks to add things to a list, and I just want to show to the user that their click actually saved it without stopping them from moving on to clicking the next checkbox.
[07:48:51] <shoky> FrankDWork: also when i said call .autocomplete on it i meant call the function, with the options you want
[07:49:19] <FrankDWork> oh -- sorry I haven't really done any JS, very noobish there
[07:50:57] <krambiorix> hi, i have a page with some divs with class "bookmark" in it... How can i check if a bookmark div appeared in the viewport when scrolling?
[07:51:20] <fps> hi, how do i integrate a plugin like DataTables into a page?
[07:52:06] <fps> [it's a node.js project and we serve the jquery.js itself without problems - i just have no clue about how to use DataTables]
[07:53:10] <fps> i have the package extracted to a location where we can serve any or all of it to the client
[07:56:30] <FrankDWork> ahh got it
[07:56:31] <fps> ah found it
[07:56:34] <fps> ;D
[07:56:47] <FrankDWork> just had to copy the same autocomplete stuff into the click handler
[08:00:28] <Bauer> myosotis: how do I make this overlay transparent: .ui-widget-overlay { background: #5c5c5c url(images/ui-bg_flat_50_5c5c5c_40x100.png) 50% 50% repeat-x; opacity: .80;filter:Alpha(Opacity=80); }
[08:00:51] <Bauer> nvm
[08:01:06] <Bauer> it was hilglighted in sorce and I couldnt see lol
[08:01:09] <myosotis> my job normally doesn't let me touch css =)
[08:01:49] <BillCriswell> Ugh, landscape mode.
[08:02:34] <shoky> Bauer: just don't edit the jquery-ui css itself ;p
[08:03:51] <krambiorix> hi, i have a page with some divs with class "bookmark" in it... How can i check if a bookmark div appeared in the viewport when scrolling?
[08:04:17] <Sal> hi, i need to replace 5 columns of a table row with only 1 column using colspan and then be able to restore all 5 columns + data
[08:04:40] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Look at the scrollTop of the window and the offset().top of the element you want to check.
[08:04:52] <Sal> i was thinking on saving all columns in an array, then remove all children of tr and add a new td colspan 5
[08:04:59] <Sal> is there a better way?
[08:06:59] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/ifAGuYEF/2/edit made this up yesterday, should be able ot help... there's a great plugin called "waypoints" that may be able ot help you if you need to do some trickery
[08:09:51] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, but that only works with one 'special' element
[08:10:08] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i have .bookmark and there are minimum 10 of them on my page
[08:10:58] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Well you can modify it to your needs or use waypoints... I'd probably use waypoints.
[08:11:18] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[08:13:42] <BillCriswell> Sal: You can just keep a clone of the 5 elements and just switch them out as you need to?
[08:14:35] <Sal> BillCriswell, you mean save each of the 5 columns in a variable coning them and then restore them when needed?
[08:14:54] <Sal> coning=cloning
[08:15:29] <BillCriswell> Sal: I think so... I'd definitely listen for someone elses approach though haha.
[08:15:57] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, waypoints doesn't work for me, i work with 2 static positioned divs ...
[08:16:15] <Sal> if i colspan the first column to 5, will it automatically cover the other 4 columns?
[08:17:01] <Sal> but maybe this way i can get different results depending on browser
[08:17:13] <Sal> ok, i'll go with the cloning
[08:18:08] <BillCriswell> Sal:I think if I could see the before -> after views of the table it would help a lot. I'm rereading the question and not sure I'm following 100%.
[08:18:41] <Sal> i have 5 td, and i need to replace them with 1 td colspan="5"
[08:18:47] <Sal> and then restore back all
[08:18:51] <Sal> thats all
[08:20:10] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, waypoints doesn't work for me, i work with 2 static positioned divs ...  -->  any idea if it's possible?
[08:20:15] <sunbeam> <h2><span class="icon phone"></span>Our phone</h2> - is this bad / not semantically correct ?
[08:22:02] <Sal> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/Lts8e/
[08:30:38] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://jsbin.com/AHEYeYid/1/edit?html,js,output this seems gross... kind of feel like it's something that should happen progrmatically but with the details I have it should be ok?
[08:31:08] <Sal> thanks, let me look
[08:31:15] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Aren't divs by default static?
[08:32:47] <Sal> great! thanks
[08:32:53] <Sal> just what i was looking for
[08:33:00] <Bauer> myosotis: still here? :) how do I select the div <div class="ui-widget-overlay".....>? I tried ('div ui-widget-overlay') but no results
[08:33:03] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i mean position:static    to keep them at the same place when scrolling
[08:33:24] <myosotis> prepend the class with a .
[08:33:35] <myosotis> '.ui-widget-overlay' or 'div.ui-widget-overlay'
[08:33:36] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I think you mean fixed?
[08:33:43] <myosotis> Bauer,
[08:33:59] <Bauer> I did that, tried ('div .ui-widget-overlay') and ('div.ui-widget-overlay')
[08:33:59] <zizzl> Hey guys trying to trigger an addClass on a div when it's scrolled to.. on this http://jsfiddle.net/Gu5ZY/1/ the first example works but I want to generalize it, I have ".section" on all my sectional divs, but when I try that second script, it adds the class to all .section's when scrolling starts, How can I make it work so that it's specfic to the section that it's scrolled to, I tried ('this') but it didn't work.
[08:34:07] <myosotis> second form
[08:34:30] <myosotis> you *may* be assigning the click event handler BEFORE the element exists (it's created when the popup is called)
[08:34:52] <Bauer> myosotis: no, I am testing it manually first in console, before writing it in code
[08:34:58] <carbon60> When using .submit on, is there a way to get the form being submitted from the event?
[08:35:33] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, ow my appologies fixed yes
[08:35:47] <myosotis> Bauer, http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/modal.html jQuery('div.ui-widget-overlay');
[08:35:55] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, you have any idea how to use waypoints that way?
[08:36:34] <Bauer> myosotis: on https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm click green VM pic, then  purpple 2008 img, and then the small text lable
[08:36:38] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: If it's fixed it's in the viewport isn't it? Don't think you can scroll to a fixed element.
[08:36:47] <Bauer> then run the selector myosotis, and it comes up empty
[08:38:01] <myosotis> Bauer, I think I'm clicking on the wrong last thing. it links me to a checkout screen
[08:39:20] <Bauer> myosotis: try now, sorry
[08:39:31] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, no, my navigation bars are fixed, and i think waypoints has problems with that
[08:40:15] <zizzl> Anyone?>
[08:40:15] <myosotis> Bauer, you mean the more details link right?
[08:40:38] <Bauer> myosotis: yes the text next to price
[08:41:15] <myosotis> jQuery('div.ui-widget-overlay'); <div class=​"ui-widget-overlay" style=​"width:​ 1285px;​ height:​ 1475px;​ z-index:​ 1001;​">​</div>​]
[08:41:25] <myosotis> seems to work correctly for me
[08:41:54] <Bauer> myosotis: using what selector?
[08:42:08] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I don't understand how you'd need to know if it's scrolled into view if the element is fixed. Can you explain when you're trying to accomplsih?
[08:42:10] <myosotis> the one I just typed
[08:43:12] <Bauer> LOL myosotis, I found out why it works for you.. I was missing the $ :P
[08:43:20] <Bauer> damn, I should go home asap
[08:43:22] <Bauer> thanks :)
[08:43:28] <myosotis> np
[08:45:41] <sunbeam> is it possible to use only a small part of an image sprite?
[08:46:50] <zizzl> Someone help por favor?
[08:47:34] <myosotis> sunbeam, http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp
[08:49:26] <sunbeam> myosotis: that way I can only use <h2><span class="icon phone"></span>Our phone</h2>
[08:49:30] <sunbeam> myosotis: is that bad?
[08:50:06] <myosotis> what are your criteria for "bad" ?
[08:50:58] <sunbeam> semantically not correct or bad for seo
[08:51:24] <myosotis> ah, no that is fine
[08:51:27] <zizzl> Can anyone tell me how to modify this code to target just the one 'section' and not all 'section's http://jsfiddle.net/kygzK/ should be a very easy fix
[08:51:29] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i have a vertical(left) and horizontal (top) fixed div's ... in the space between i have a div that's very long (high) and in that div i want to use waypoints...But that doesn't seem to work...
[08:52:35] <sunbeam> myosotis: is that not bad semantically?
[08:52:47] <myosotis> seems fine to me
[08:54:07] <bigbugjava> hi, rendering an object from server-side to broswer, now I need to add it to datatable, cant succeed!! any ideas on why?
[08:56:33] <zizzl> BillCriswell, you able to check my issue, I'm sure you'll be able to fix it in seconds
[08:56:47] <_rgn> bigbugjava: imagine your question from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about your code or environment. what do you think anyone could say?
[08:58:48] <bigbugjava> _rgn true, let me pull it together
[08:58:50] <bigbugjava> sec
[09:00:14] <bigbugjava> _rgn if you get an object from server that looks like this : Object->Object->Property, how can you add that Property's onto a jquery dataTables
[09:02:01] <Bauer> myosotis: it works now from JS :) except that, after a few times you close the popup by clicking outside the dialog, it gets stuck...
[09:05:53] <Bauer> myosotis: actually it happens on the second click on the same details dialog opening
[09:07:46] <Bauer> also myosotis: when using modal dialog, apparently F5 doesnt work, F12 doesnt work.. many normal browser functions are frozen like async: false.. its not good
[09:07:47] <myosotis> try attaching the click handler to the document once instead of the overlay every time a popup is created, like this: $(document).on('click', 'ui-widget-overlay', function(ev) {});
[09:08:17] <BillCriswell> zizzl: I'd probably just use http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/ to do this since I'm not sure what I'm thinking would be more efficient, but here it is anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/kygzK/1/
[09:08:34] <Bauer> myosotis: I didnt understand that one, when to attach it? what it does again?
[09:12:32] <Bauer> myosotis: I get Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on'
[09:12:39] <Bauer> keep in mind I use jquery 1.3
[09:13:19] <myosotis> oh
[09:13:28] <joroci> why are you using 1.3:
[09:13:29] <myosotis> maybe live function? don't remember when it was deprecated
[09:13:34] <shoky> 1.3 would need .live :\
[09:13:37] <joroci> 1.8 if i recall
[09:14:23] <Bauer> joroci: out of no choice atm
[09:15:04] <shoky> Bauer: then $('.ui-widget-overlay').live('click', function(e) { ... })  would do the same in 1.3
[09:15:23] <BillCriswell> There's something going on in mobile webkit where I'm getting a border radius on an element, but it's not showing up in the styles... it's so weird.
[09:15:43] <Bauer> shoky: whats inside the function? the closure of the dialog?
[09:16:14] <shoky> Bauer: the event handler, same as you'd write for .on or .bind
[09:16:25] <myosotis> yes, that's where you would close the dialog
[09:16:34] <shoky> Bauer: but, make this call only once on page load or something, not everytime a dialog is opened
[09:16:48] <shoky> otherwise you'll be adding up click handlers
[09:18:05] <utroda> How can I write a selector that would get any element that has input- in it. $(ele).closest('.input-*') is what I'm trying to do.
[09:18:27] <Bauer> thanks shoky! you are my hero in the last 24 hours :P
[09:18:49] <Bauer> shoky: like this you mean right? http://jsfiddle.net/K4qrY/
[09:18:54] <Bauer> its being called only on creation
[09:20:04] <shoky> Bauer: no i mean only call it ONCE exactly ;P  you can do something like:  $('.ui-widget-overlay').live('click', function() { $('.ui-dialog-content').dialog('close'); })
[09:20:44] <shoky> Bauer: call it once on page load, then you don't need to think about it or call it agian when opening some dialog
[09:20:45] <zizzl> BillCriswell, why if i change that to addClass instead of toggle, it triggers every <section> I want it to trigger separately like you had it but I don't want it to remove the class after
[09:20:48] <joroci> why not make a button for close :)?
[09:21:11] <shoky> utroda: what is input- ?
[09:21:28] <Bauer> joroci: there is a button in the dialog itself, but the higher ups think they know better, and think the user must have a way to close the dialog like this, by clicking anywhere else :D
[09:21:45] <utroda> shoky: its a class prefix, i just want to get every element that has that prefix
[09:22:05] <utroda> shoky: so i have input-foo, input-bar, input-baz
[09:22:37] <shoky> utroda: better to separate the classes.  class="input foo"    class="input bar"   class="input baz"
[09:22:37] <utroda> shoky: so i want to get the closest input- regardless of the foo, bar, baz
[09:22:50] <BillCriswell> zizzl: You could just do addClass() and have the if like you did before.
[09:23:24] <zizzl> BillCriswell I tried on your code http://jsfiddle.net/kygzK/2/ and it doesn't work, applies it to all sections at once http://jsfiddle.net/kygzK/2/
[09:23:30] <shoky> utroda: then you could just use ".input" and not mess your code and html with prefixes
[09:23:41] <zizzl> not sure why I copied that twice
[09:23:47] <shoky> utroda: and it should make the css easier too
[09:24:05] <shoky> utroda: that's how you're supposed to use classes, anyways
[09:24:13] <BillCriswell> zizzl: http://jsfiddle.net/kygzK/4/
[09:25:29] <shoky> Bauer:  but change the inside to what i said ;p
[09:26:13] <Bauer> I just did shoky :) but one problem remains
[09:26:22] <Bauer> when the modal dialog is open, you cant even click F5
[09:26:34] <Bauer> as if it sets some kind of async: false
[09:26:51] <shoky> mm works for me
[09:27:06] <shoky> there's nothing like that going on in jquery ui
[09:27:32] <Bauer> you are right :) previously it didnt work
[09:28:22] <Bauer> thanks a lot :) only thing remains is for the design guy to properly place the buttons.. its a bit hard because they said they wanted those buttons AFTER we designed everything else.. they just dont fit in well in CSS now
[09:28:58] <shoky> np. i'd recommend making the overlay at least a tiny bit visible, otherwise it's not clear why i can't click on stuff when the dialog's open
[09:29:07] <shoky> it's bad UX
[09:29:50] <Bauer> hmmm, but if you (try) clicking on something, the overlay will disappear.. but yeah you got a point
[09:30:02] <shoky> well nothing disappears if it's not visible ;p
[09:30:15] <shoky> as far as the user is concerned
[09:30:44] <Bauer> hehe, true :) well tomorrow - the CSS is on another server not under my direct control
[09:31:02] <shoky> heh bummer
[09:31:35] <Bauer> ohh actually not, we uploaded it to the linux server eventually :) one sec
[09:40:58] <hlve> shoky: how would you capture if someone is holding the shift key and pressing the up arrow key?
[09:41:12] <hlve> event.which == 40 && shiftKey?
[09:42:11] <shoky> hlve: something like that ;p
[09:42:33] <hlve> it's not capturing it. Is there a keynumber for shift?
[09:42:34] <hlve> :s
[09:46:39] <hlve> ah. 16.
[09:47:46] <shoky> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/zf45A/
[09:48:37] <hlve> why === and not ==?
[09:48:51] <shoky> because you shouldn't use ==
[09:49:03] <shoky> because it's prone to bugs
[09:49:37] <shoky> === means you know what you want. you're a real man
[09:49:40] <hlve> lol
[09:49:46] <hlve> I love how you explain things :o)
[09:49:58] <shoky> ;]
[09:52:31] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/zf45A/2/ ^^ ?
[09:53:01] <hlve> it's only taking the first if
[09:53:02] <shoky> i'll zap you
[09:53:07] <hlve> lol
[09:53:10] <shoky> yes, that's what "else" means
[09:53:31] <hlve> am i just broken when it comes to jquery?
[09:58:31] <shoky> or jquery is broken when it comes to you, equally possible
[10:07:50] <grafi> impossible
[10:07:51] <grafi> !
[10:10:13] <grafi> shoky what do you think about a plugin like this https://github.com/veloek/jquery.if-else
[10:14:18] <Fallout2man> Can I ask questions related to jQuery mobile here or is there a better channel for that?
[10:20:52] <rocky> anyone have a favourite free-for-commercial-use jquery based photo slider?
[10:23:37] <hugo_m> how can I make a function block until an ajax get is completed using query deferred + promises?
[10:23:50] <grafi> oO
[10:24:24] <grafi> "how can i make a car stop by accelerating?"
[10:24:39] <grafi> you could drive into a wall i suppose
[10:24:40] <hugo_m> you cant?
[10:25:13] <grafi> why would you want to block in the first place?
[10:25:35] <hugo_m> why not?
[10:25:39] <_rgn> lol
[10:25:55] <_rgn> "why not?" because that's not how you do things in javascript
[10:26:11] <grafi> maybe because the a in ajax stands for asynchonous as in non-blocking?
[10:26:14] <grafi> or something
[10:26:19] <grafi> what do I know
[10:26:22] <Joey__> I don't think driving into a wall qualifies as accelerating
[10:26:24] <hugo_m> have you ever used deferred promises?
[10:26:42] <grafi> Joey__ well you could drive into a wall while accelerating
[10:26:46] <grafi> and you would stop
[10:26:48] <grafi> ^^
[10:27:08] <hugo_m> have you ever used deferreds?
[10:27:30] <grafi> have you?
[10:27:36] <hugo_m> have you?
[10:27:43] <grafi> have you?
[10:27:47] <hugo_m> i asked first
[10:27:48] <Joey__> if you drive against the rotation of the earth, and accelerate to the speed of rotation, you would stop the movement of the car
[10:28:08] <grafi> Joey__ i love where you are taking this ^^
[10:31:18] <Fallout2man> Well I'm just going to ask then. Is there any way in jQuery Mobile to have smooth scrolling (I.E. Panning like in a native UIScrollView) between pages in a multi-page template that doesn't use ajax?
[10:31:57] <Fallout2man> I've got a potential project in the works but smooth scrolling is a must-have and I'm not sure if that's possible on the html side of things or if we'd have to roll our own native client to do it.
[10:32:47] <FrankDWork> Is there a reason that this should give me 'undefined' as a result?: alert("My id is " + $(this).attr('id'));
[10:32:47] <FrankDWork> element definitely has an id
[10:34:07] <FrankDWork> if i alert($(this)) it gives me "object Object"
[10:36:32] <hugo_m> don't ask for grafi's help, he'll just make a dumb analogy to belittle you
[10:37:08] <_rgn> you're the one being difficult
[10:37:21] <hugo_m> I'm done
[10:37:25] <_rgn> yeah. bye
[10:39:27] <grafi> i for one found the analogy rather awesome
[10:40:52] <hugo_m> because you have a napoleon complex
[10:41:03] <hugo_m> are you short in real life?
[10:42:03] <grafi> only 1,87
[10:43:25] <hugo_m> then it must be something else that must be short on you
[10:44:58] <grafi> must be
[11:20:56] <counter> I'm using jquery with backbone and marionette.  I have a navbar here: http://dpaste.com/1483880/
[11:21:44] <counter> I'm looking to make the <li> with the appropriate <a> to be set active when on that page.  How would I go about this with jquery.
[11:38:04] <doosdan> I try to do this? `var singer = $('#singer');` and then I want to do `singer.hide()`
[11:38:22] <doosdan> but its not working.. what is the correct way to do that
[11:38:44] <NoiseEee> doosdan: perhaps you are doing it before the DOM is ready
[11:40:32] <doosdan> NoiseEee oh so its correct syntactically? i haven't run it yet, I working on netbeans and when i write `$('#singer').` the hide option appear but when i write `singer.` the hide is not listed
[11:41:13] <NoiseEee> doosdan: then complain to netbeans
[11:41:32] <doosdan> NoiseEee ok thank you
[11:41:50] <NoiseEee> doosdan:  if all you're doing is hiding it, then there's no need to assign to 'singer' first, you can just do $('#singer').hide()
[11:42:54] <doosdan> NoiseEee I using $('#singer') several times so I stored it in variable
[11:43:01] <NoiseEee> doosdan: sweet
[11:50:30] <FrankDWork> is there a good way to act on an input box changing other than keyup?
[11:50:44] <FrankDWork> er act on an input box change
[11:50:57] <FrankDWork> ie if someone paste via mouse, or clicks an autocomplete result
[11:51:26] <fps> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[11:52:32] <fps> FrankDWork: that was for you
[11:52:47] <FrankDWork> i tried .change, doesnt seem to trigger
[11:53:01] <fps> show code
[11:53:05] <fps> would be a bug i guess
[11:53:10] <fps> either in jquery or in your code
[11:53:52] <FrankDWork> http://pastebin.com/4pSH9TVG
[11:53:56] <FrankDWork> that works for keyboard events
[11:54:15] <FrankDWork> if i make it change instead of keyup and put an alert in the first line th alert never does anything
[11:54:26] <FrankDWork> jQuery 1.10.2
[11:57:14] <FrankDWork> .change fires once if I reload the page
[12:00:17] <FrankDWork> fps, thats under $(document).ready, should it be somewhere else?
[12:02:48] <FrankDWork> ah on('input', function(
[12:03:26] <FrankDWork> or not
[12:03:58] <fps> FrankDWork: oh, sorry, was looking at hotels to book my vacation
[12:04:06] <FrankDWork> fps nice :)
[12:04:17] <fps> yes, the right place to register functions is usually in document.ready
[12:04:39] <doosdan> I have 2 radio buttons and the first one have event listener `if(singer.is(':checked')){//working}else{//not working}` when I click on the second radio I expect the first radio to fire and execute the else statement but its not. I expecting anything wrong?
[12:05:00] <fps> FrankDWork: there's an example at the bottom of the page for a text input
[12:05:43] <FrankDWork> is there a reason keyup would fire and change wouldnt?
[12:06:03] <fps> FrankDWork: in your code snippet i don't see any use of change()
[12:06:34] <fps> ah ok
[12:06:38] <fps> it says so in the docs:
[12:06:45] <fps> "For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus."
[12:06:50] <fps> sorry for misleading you
[12:07:04] <FrankDWork> yeah and it isnt firing every time
[12:08:06] <fps> FrankDWork: also try oninput like in answer #9 here:
[12:08:08] <FrankDWork> and it looks like if it fires once it doesnt fire again for some reason
[12:08:09] <fps> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6153047/jquery-detect-changed-input-text-box
[12:08:15] <FrankDWork> yeah i tried on input too haha
[12:08:19] <FrankDWork> ugh
[12:09:18] <FrankDWork> on input works great for keyboard input!
[12:09:33] <FrankDWork> but not if it changes because you clicked an autocomplete entry
[12:09:46] <FrankDWork> is there a better way to solve validation that im missing?
[12:10:13] <fps> hmm
[12:10:19] <fps> let's see how google does it ;D
[12:11:03] <fps> meh, obfuscated code
[12:11:18] <FrankDWork> yeah i looked as you said that, scurry
[12:11:18] <FrankDWork> haha
[12:11:54] <FrankDWork> they dont use .on, .change or .keyup though1
[12:13:17] <fps> FrankDWork: an ugly workaround would be to just use a timer
[12:13:25] <FrankDWork> blech
[12:13:27] <fps> FrankDWork: and regularly check for changed content
[12:13:28] <FrankDWork> there has to be a cleaner way
[12:13:34] <fps> it would work for all cases though
[12:13:43] <FrankDWork> the text box knows when its changed :P
[12:13:46] <FrankDWork> this would be easy in C haha
[12:13:58] <fps> depends on the GUI toolkit
[12:13:59] <fps> but yeah
[12:14:24] <doosdan> I wrote a test example on http://jsfiddle.net/4Kd9V/ can some tell me why else statement is not executing when the condition is false?
[12:15:33] <doosdan> there was a small syntax mistake on first one http://jsfiddle.net/4Kd9V/1/
[12:17:05] <FrankDWork> i wonder how the validate thing does it.. that doesnt update immediately with a change either
[12:17:14] <FrankDWork> but atleast it actually fires when the textbox loses focus
[12:17:32] <FrankDWork> which isnt happening when i use change / on('input')
[12:17:34] <fps> doosdan: look at the ids of your spans
[12:18:05] <fps> still doesn't seem to work though
[12:18:06] <fps> hmm
[12:18:42] <fps> oh he left
[12:21:00] <FrankDWork> $('.cmts').bind("change keyup input focus focusout"
[12:21:02] <FrankDWork> kind of sort of works
[12:21:46] <fps> i'm clueless
[12:23:55] <FrankDWork> hmm
[12:24:22] <FrankDWork> hmm to trigger "change" on all elements with the cmts class is that $('.cmts').change();
[12:24:23] <FrankDWork> ?
[12:25:49] <NoiseEee> you were closer with trigger
[12:26:21] <NoiseEee> $('.cmts').trigger('change') iirc
[12:29:37] <Jeab> Anyone have any idea why this works in this fiddle but the click function wont work on the site? http://jsfiddle.net/v4SNc/
[12:30:35] <jedimind> because your site uses potato instead of jquery
[12:30:58] <Jeab> no i disabled potato
[12:31:13] <jedimind> oh, then im all out of ideas
[12:31:45] <FrankDWork> hmm autocomplete select isnt firing either
[12:31:45] <FrankDWork> wtf
[12:32:03] <daslicht> whats is the best way to create such a wizard : https://www.disney-content.de/login/
[12:32:11] <daslicht> i found http://mstratman.github.io/jQuery-Smart-Wizard/
[12:32:23] <daslicht> but it has no validation for a select
[12:32:30] <daslicht> how would you solve this ?
[12:33:04] <daslicht> i was asked to add such kind to a wordpress project , but their form use some kind of own validator
[12:33:40] <daslicht> they use jqForm
[12:38:18] <FrankDWork> hrmm well it triggers in firefox andnot in chrome.. nice
[12:38:23] <FrankDWork> glad to see web development has progressed so far
[12:48:25] <shoky> ?
[12:51:56] <guideX> jquery foundation custom forms 1.0 dropdown, it seems like tabbing to/from it doesn't work, any ideas
[13:00:45] <NickNack> i know this isnt the channel for this but is anyone here familiar with soundmanager2?
[13:12:51] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, youstil there?
[13:13:33] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:13:43] <BillCriswell> Physically, at least.
[13:14:03] <krambiorix> about that waypoint thingy ...
[13:14:05] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/
[13:15:20] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i can't seem to make it work
[13:16:25] <jtal> why cant I see variables defined above an $.each(... ?
[13:16:27] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, you are not loading the proper waypoint.js file
[13:16:37] <clarkfischer> try linking to the 'raw' link
[13:17:59] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/2/
[13:18:01] <jtal> maybe I'm confusing a callback function and a closure
[13:18:50] <clarkfischer> jtal, you should be able to reference vars within a parent scope. example of the issue?
[13:19:55] <jtal> http://pastie.org/8510898
[13:20:50] <jtal> oops sorry
[13:20:53] <clarkfischer> and you are attempting to access the value of peopleWithRole within the $.each callback?
[13:20:54] <moijk> I need to compare two nested json trees, if nodes is moved etc. Now any idea how to do that the least "reinventing the wheel" way?
[13:21:16] <krambiorix> clarkfischer, any idea?
[13:21:36] <jtal> http://pastie.org/8510902
[13:21:49] <jtal> clarkfischer: I cant access "role" from inside the callback function
[13:22:03] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, under the 'external resources' section you've listed an HTML document as a JS dependency.  link to github's 'raw' URL
[13:22:41] <krambiorix> clarkfischer, http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/2/
[13:23:50] <shoky> jtal: that works fine.. you've got something else going on
[13:23:57] <clarkfischer> jtal, http://jsfiddle.net/8Ukkc/
[13:24:10] <jtal> whhaaa
[13:24:47] <shoky> what do you mean by "cant access" ?
[13:25:15] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, it looks like (at least in chrome), that the JS won't execute because github is serving it without a Content-Type header.
[13:25:47] <grafi> silly chrome
[13:25:48] <grafi> :p
[13:27:06] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, also you aren't loading jQuery
[13:27:43] <krambiorix> clarkfischer, http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/3/     :-)
[13:28:46] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, I take it it's working for you?  Chrome is still refusing to execute waypoint.js
[13:29:37] <krambiorix> clarkfischer, in firefox no error or something, it just doesn't work
[13:30:42] <shoky> don't use raw.github.com in jsfiddle
[13:30:47] <shoky> change it to rawgithub.com
[13:31:43] <krambiorix> shoky, clarkfischer , BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/4/
[13:32:03] <shoky> might wanna include jquery too
[13:33:01] <krambiorix> shoky, clarkfischer http://jsfiddle.net/gQqt6/5/
[13:34:13] <shoky> krambiorix: ok?
[13:34:20] <clarkfischer> krambiorix, are you totally sure you're using this lib right?  the docs seem to suggest that the callback only fires when the selected elems hit the TOP of the viewport. your title element is like the last thing there
[13:34:25] <krambiorix> shoky, it doesn't work
[13:34:37] <shoky> krambiorix: it doesn't hit the top of the viewport. works fine
[13:37:25] <krambiorix> shoky, ok, changed that, but on my computer it stil doesn't work
[13:38:12] <shoky> bummer
[13:39:55] <krambiorix> shoky, could it be the reason that all elements are created by ajax?
[13:40:23] <shoky> could be. could be many reasons though
[13:41:02] <shoky> calling $('.bla') when the element doesn't exist will not find anything
[13:41:02] <krambiorix> shoky, any debugging ideas?
[13:41:39] <shoky> so if you're adding them by ajax, you'll probably need to initialize the waypoints thing then. unless it has a way to delegate events i donno
[13:42:16] <krambiorix> shoky, ow damn that was it
[13:44:06] <krambiorix> shoky, that's really stupid of me
[13:44:11] <krambiorix> shoky, clarkfischer thanks a lot!
[13:54:25] <shredding> Hey all.
[13:57:19] <jtal> hey
[14:05:45] <Beg_> 
[14:06:46] <arkore> hello.  i followed the jquery plugin tutorial for creating a plugin.  after i load it $('.post').EnhanceIt({template:'test',refresh:function(){console.log('refreshing');}); in my $(document).ready(function() {...}); -- when i try to use it later with code like $('#post-1').refresh()  it says "has no method 'refresh'" --
[14:07:44] <HexSquid> join #ubuntu
[14:07:45] <Zak> arkore: please don't paste so much code in here. better to put it in jsfiddle or somewhere else
[14:08:49] <Zak> arkore: can you show us the code where you are creating your plugin?
[14:09:12] <arkore> k
[14:10:50] <Zak> to simplify it, if you're trying to create a plugin, somewhere you'll need a line that says jQuery.fn.yourFunction = function() { ...
[14:13:35] <Zak> Also, just be careful that your function names aren't too common. e.g. "refresh". Most plugins don't detect collisions and dealing with collisions is a little annoying
[14:13:55] <Zak> although it's not the end of the world
[14:14:07] <tw2113> wouldn't namespacing alleviate that?
[14:14:34] <Zak> sure, if you're not extending the jquery facade
[14:15:03] <Lewix> I have a list of link and content. i want to simply hide/show the content when a link is clicked. What am I doing wrong?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dff75705880ee1959f39 (class toggle is for the links)
[14:15:54] <Zak> Lewix: why not just use hide() and show() methods?
[14:16:26] <Zak> or is this toggling expanded?
[14:17:16] <Lewix> Zak: oh should have thought of that.. but still what's the difference? my gist should work right
[14:18:28] <Zak> Lewix: lemme just try it. sec
[14:18:45] <Zak> sort of not sure about the $(this).next
[14:20:41] <Lewix> Zak: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a17afa38789b14fe1a57
[14:20:54] <Lewix> Zak: next for the next element
[14:20:58] <Lewix> which is the content
[14:21:36] <Matthew__> $(this).next => is a function and should be $(this).next()
[14:22:42] <Lewix> Matthew__: ahhh thanks. let me try it
[14:22:52] <Lewix> Matthew__: im stlll new to jquery i dont do the obvious
[14:23:23] <Lewix> Matthew__: nope still not working
[14:23:30] <arkore> ok, my code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/RL7Tg/4/  in the Console, it says: has no method 'refreshPost'
[14:24:40] <Lewix> Matthew__: Zak: that was a parenthesis issue
[14:25:22] <Lewix>  Matthew__ Zak: what's javascript:void(0) is for exactly
[14:25:37] <Matthew__> for creating anti-patterns
[14:25:42] <Zak> lol
[14:25:48] <Zak> hang on. i'm having issues with jsfiddle
[14:26:02] <Zak> but yeah, i got your example to work
[14:27:44] <Zak> man, what is going on with jsfiddle
[14:27:44] <Matthew__> @Lewix to answer you, when I have a question I don't fully understand in Javascript, I search for it on Google and append MDN on my search.  This will get you to an excellent wiki hosted by Mozilla.
[14:27:52] <arkore> Zak, you talking to me?
[14:28:01] <Zak> arkore: no. hang on. i'll check out your code in a sec
[14:28:01] <Matthew__> Just you /Zak
[14:28:06] <arkore> oh ok
[14:28:22] <Zak> Matthew__: jsfiddle just isn't working for me :P
[14:28:43] <Matthew__> I'm new to IRC Zak, how do I mention?
[14:29:02] <Zak> depends on your client. i just have tab autocompletion
[14:29:03] <Jon47> just type their name, if their client is any good it will notify them
[14:29:12] <Jon47> (if they want to be notified)
[14:29:14] <Matthew__> I'm using Hexchat
[14:29:21] <Matthew__> is that good?
[14:29:24] <louism2wash> Hey guys, if I have an event listener bound to an object that is removed from the dom using "$(dom_el).remove()" does that cause a memory leak?  Should be unbinding listeners before removing elements from the DOM?
[14:29:51] <Jon47> louism2wash: read the docs for .remove
[14:29:54] <Jon47> it's all in there
[14:30:08] <Zak> Lewix: get rid of next()
[14:30:27] <Lewix> Zak: why? it works
[14:30:32] <Lewix> Matthew__: thanks ill check it out
[14:30:41] <louism2wash> Jon47: right you are
[14:31:02] <Zak> Lewix: if it's working, then it's probably not working as you think it is

[14:31:59] <Zak> arkore: looking at your code now
[14:32:08] <arkore> cool thx
[14:32:20] <Matthew__> Zak, he may have a sibling that he wants to apply the css to.
[14:32:23] <Zak> Lewix: btw, it might be working for you, because you've got multiple matches being returned
[14:32:50] <Lewix> Zak: i dont think you understood what I was trying to do. a simple list of links. Whenever I click on  one those it shows the content directly below
[14:34:11] <arkore> Lewix, that's how you do it.  he gave you the code.
[14:34:35] <Matthew__> I'm thinking Lewix wants to apply the css to a sibling.
[14:34:45] <Lewix> arkore: I did it already. he was suggesting that I remove next(). And this is my code by the way with next() removed and the css changed
[14:35:00] <Zak> ok guys chill
[14:35:03] <Matthew__> LOL
[14:35:04] <arkore> each link with a classname of "toggle" will have "open" class added.  use CSS to style for revealing your text with .toggle.open { }
[14:35:10] <Lewix> Anyways it works. thanks a lot Zak Matthew__

[14:36:11] <Lewix> https://gist.github.com/6ewis/90c0f10e59bd4f1cfb19
[14:37:17] <Zak> arkore: what error are you getting?
[14:37:31] <Zak> oh nm, i see what you mean
[14:37:43] <arkore> Zak, when clicking the button, i get: has no method "refreshPost"
[14:40:14] <Zak> when you're assigning the function "refreshPost", it looks like you're trying to assign it to the jquery facade?
[14:43:04] <arkore> i dont really know what that means
[14:44:48] <Matthew__> test Zak,
[14:44:53] <Matthew__> Zak, test
[14:44:57] <Matthew__> bahhhh
[14:45:00] <Zak> Matthew__: what are you trying to achieve
[14:45:08] <Matthew__> mentioning
[14:45:18] <Zak> what is mentioning
[14:45:53] <Matthew__> When you comment and my name appears before your comment.
[14:46:04] <arkore> Zak, or anyone, know what i need to do to get that button to work as expected?
[14:46:43] <Zak> arkore: are you familiar with debugging?
[14:47:19] <Zak> if you are, put in a debugger; statement before this.refreshPost = . You'll see what I mean
[14:47:23] <arkore> some forms of debugging.
[14:47:48] <Zak> if you're writing a fair amount of JS, you should put aside 10 mins and learn how to debug properly
[14:48:04] <Matthew__> true dat
[14:48:34] <Zak> there's a few things you're doing which seems a bit odd
[14:49:45] <Zak> arkore: imho, i would be creating another class that wraps a DOM element
[14:50:51] <Zak> $('#foo').extender({/* options go here */})
[14:51:07] <Zak> then that on that object, you would call all your methods
[14:52:16] <Zak> this is also cleaner, because you'll only then have 1 property which can potentially collide
[14:52:20] <seancurtis> what's happening with the jQuery bugtracker?
[14:53:20] <Zak> arkore: let me try and throw something together, so you know what i mean
[14:53:43] <arkore> Zak, debugger is neat, but im still trying to figure it out
[14:53:46] <arkore> ok
[14:54:07] <Zak> arkore: if you've got a half decent browser, you can just set breakpoints immediately
[14:54:13] <Zak> *directly
[14:55:32] <krambiorix> how can i find a previous element of the same type?
[14:55:49] <krambiorix> i tried $("a#myid").prev("a") but tht doesn't do it
[14:56:59] <Matthew__> $("#myid").parent().find("a")
[14:57:16] <Matthew__> but you said element, so do you want the 1?
[14:58:42] <seancurtis> krambiorix: is there prevAll()?
[14:58:47] <seancurtis> not sure the ordering of that
[14:58:56] <seancurtis> prevAll("a").first()
[14:58:59] <seancurtis> maybe?
[14:59:17] <krambiorix> Matthew__, i want the previous element of that type
[15:01:30] <Matthew__> so you want $("#myid").prevUntil("a").eq(0);
[15:02:11] <krambiorix> Matthew__, why eq(0) ?
[15:03:10] <Matthew__> gets the first one, I don't know what is in your DOM, so I have to write it in a way that you get the first one. If it works w/o it, great!
[15:03:22] <Zak> arkore: i'm still here. hang on.
[15:03:35] <arkore> :)
[15:06:40] <malibu> I have a model class that I need to retrieve subsets of based on one of the fields.  How do I get all the children of the set of parent classes?
[15:06:43] <needlz_> can anyone help me debug/find out why this jquery lib is not loading: http://jsfiddle.net/fdDkL/5/
[15:07:51] <needlz_> console log doesn't show me anything either and I'm too dumb to figure out why
[15:08:03] <seancurtis> krambiorix: use .prevAll("a").first()
[15:09:14] <Matthew__> @seancurtis, I'm thinking that'll return something different.
[15:09:47] <Matthew__> @needlz What is wrong? The accordian is working for me.
[15:10:29] <needlz_> Matthew__: the accordion, yes :) there is a wizard plugin (acc-wizard.js) which should function like this: http://sathomas.me/acc-wizard/#addwizard
[15:12:28] <Zak> arkore: http://jsfiddle.net/DzdgM/
[15:13:16] <verysoftoiletppr> hello
[15:13:17] <Zak> arkore: i would do something like this. create an object which is associated for each DOM element
[15:13:38] <arkore> Zak, interesting.  that's quite different from all the other docs i've been reading.  ok, thx
[15:14:35] <verysoftoiletppr> Is it expensive to do $(alreadyJqueryObject)? What is the best way to handle functions which expect jquery elements as parameters?
[15:14:53] <Zak> arkore: there's probably a large improvement for that code, but it gives another approach
[15:14:54] <seancurtis> Matthew__: works fine here: http://jsbin.com/UnamOfo/2/edit
[15:15:04] <Matthew__> you have a typo
[15:15:21] <Matthew__> there was two `z` in your class in the html
[15:15:30] <Matthew__> http://jsfiddle.net/fdDkL/6/
[15:17:27] <needlz_> Matthew__: you won't believe how much time I've spent on this.. :s thank you so much!
[15:17:53] <Matthew__> no worries... that little edit I put in there has save me lots of time. Definitely use it. :)
[15:18:20] <jtal> oh, I see now
[15:20:58] <krambiorix> seancurtis, that was it, thanks all!!!
[15:21:30] <jtal> http://pastie.org/8511121
[15:21:40] <jtal> ok, so I cant access the var 'data' that is sent into the function
[15:21:44] <jtal> from within the each
[15:22:39] <Matthew__> you are right @seancurtis!  It sorts them starting with the closest element.  Didn't know that...
[15:24:03] <seancurtis> well it makes sense right, it'll iterate back up the siblings and will stuff them into an array in the order they're found (as normal jquery selection does) and then .first() pulls out the first one :)
[15:24:50] <Matthew__> I was looking to learn something today and BAM! there it is!
[15:28:19] <Matthew__> @jtal What's in your getStuffs() function?
[15:34:04] <Foo-Bar> hey guys
[15:34:06] <jtal> Matthew__: its an object with key/values that are strings
[15:34:24] <Foo-Bar> I have an issue with using the fadeOut() on flash objects
[15:34:36] <Foo-Bar> the problem only occurs in Firefox and Opera ... perhaps safari too
[15:35:21] <Foo-Bar> oh yeah ... its worse in safari, it doesn't even hide the flash objects when the fadeOut is completed
[16:01:06] <otherj> anyone extended stripe's jquery.payment to validate the name and email field, or used jquery's validate in conjunction with it?
[16:05:22] <ryanneufeld> otherj: jquery doesn't have a validate, there is a validate plugin that was written by a jquery maintainer
[16:05:38] <otherj> ...
[16:05:58] <otherj> what was the point of writing that? hoenstly
[16:06:39] <ryanneufeld> You had it wrong
[16:07:03] <otherj> look kid, i'm not going to tell you off
[16:07:06] <otherj> but imagine that i did ok?
[16:08:03] <ryanneufeld> otherj: I'm sorry, you were saying?
[16:08:04] <otherj> yeah, i'm worried
[16:08:15] <ryanneufeld> I was going to help you
[16:08:29] <ryanneufeld> but clearly you're more interested in being a dick
[16:08:30] <otherj> no
[16:08:35] <otherj> you're arguing semantics for no reason
[16:08:39] <otherj> we both know it's not part of core
[16:08:42] <otherj> that doesn't matter
[16:09:02] <ryanneufeld> it does to many noobs, who assume that all jquery plugins are maintained by jquery
[16:09:11] <otherj> so being like "you have it wrong" does nothing except make you look like an pedantic dork
[16:09:13] <otherj> you know?
[16:09:31] <otherj> and then opping up and saying that?
[16:09:41] <otherj> whatever. i'm not interested in your bullshit. ban me if you want
[16:09:47] <snover> i have a huge erection right now
[16:09:51] <snover> just saying
[16:09:53] <tjf26> When using ajax loaded tabs, is there any way to have the newly loaded data automatically inherit the css of the parent loading page? It seems like the only way is to include the stylesheets again in the ajax loaded html which is an extra call and also causes a momentary flash on the screen while the browser upgrades from standard html buttons, text boxes, etc to the stylized versions.
[16:10:25] <ryanneufeld> just because
[16:10:31] <snover> for no reason
[16:10:43] <snover> oh it’s gone now
[16:10:44] <snover> weird
[16:10:49] <otherj> god. so pointless.
[16:10:52] <snover> oh now it’s back again
[16:10:58] <snover> thanks vladikoff
[16:11:08] <vladikoff> snover, hello!
[16:11:59] <snover> +o stands for orgy
[16:12:04] <snover> i assume
[16:12:12] <otherj> i wish!
[16:12:19] <snover> sup guys
[16:12:24] <ryanneufeld> oh, it's back
[16:12:51] <snover> how am i supposed to be a voyeur when you do that
[16:12:52] <snover> i mean
[16:12:54] <snover> exhibitionist
[16:12:54] <snover> sorry
[16:12:56] <otherj> keep up the good work ryanneufeld
[16:13:04] <otherj> i'm sure you feel very powerful
[16:13:11] <otherj> can we get back to code now?
[16:13:11] <snover> he’s the dominatrix
[16:13:18] <snover> i don’t know what else you came in here asking for
[16:13:25] <snover> it’s all abuse all the time
[16:13:26] <ryanneufeld> get back to? I didn't see any code
[16:13:38] <otherj> this guy.
[16:13:48] <snover> HURTS SO GOOD
[16:13:50] <ryanneufeld> just someone asking a group of people a vague question with out actually stating what his problem was
[16:15:01] <ryanneufeld> vladikoff: but I was having so much fun with him
[16:15:12] <ryanneufeld> I was gonna keep kicking him until he left on his own :p
[16:33:15] <ryanneufeld> vladikoff: now I'm less upset you banned him
[16:33:32] <snover> ban vladikoff
[16:33:33] <snover> what a jerk
[16:44:08] <tehopeologist> hey all
[16:44:23] <tehopeologist> how do i have .text update from a variable that should be changing its value?
[16:44:33] <tehopeologist> so, say i have a var that's the offset of an image i'm moving around
[16:44:46] <tehopeologist> how do i output the offset.top in text so i can see that the number is changing?
[16:44:57] <tehopeologist> i thought it was just .text(var);
[16:45:02] <tehopeologist> and it'd auto-update =/

[16:52:18] <HowardwLo> I'm trying to make next cycle through the different paragraphs, displaying then not displaying each as it goes through
[17:15:31] <clarkfischer> HowardwLo, make sure you have jQuery loaded (left bar, select a jQuery version)
[17:24:52] <HowardwLo> clarkfischer: how did i forget that… thanks alot.
[17:25:15] <HowardwLo> clarkfischer: do you have tips/suggestions? its not working as i expected it to
[17:29:21] <clarkfischer> works for me
[17:55:33] <OptimizedCoder> Hello, is there a really easy way to get a script on a web-browser that I can use to achieve this : if I just type this specific text : FEEDxxxx in the URL bar --> this should automatically open up a unique URL: http://abcd/FEEDxxxx. This seems to be really easy to me. Is there something I can use? I guess what I'm asking is an easy way to map (could be browser-specific) a specific string to an URL.
[17:56:07] <OptimizedCoder> To expand on what I need : this is exactly what I need : Just so I make this clear, if I type this in the URLbar of the web-browser : FEED4452 --> this needs to open the specific URL : http://abcd/FEED4452. If I say, type FEED3211, this needs to open http://abcd/FEED3211..
[18:44:59] <Jeab> anyone experienced able to help me out?
[18:45:34] <BillCriswell> Jeab: Just ask a question. If someone can help they will.
[18:46:25] <Jeab> I'd like help with a specific page, don't really just wanna post it
[18:47:00] <ahhughes> Is there a way I can determine if window.open(url); will be blocked? Currently this is trying to open a pdf but it is being blocked.
[18:47:16] <ahhughes> or alternatively, is there a workaround for this problem?
[18:47:57] <BillCriswell> Jeab: You can try to isolate the issue at jsbin.com, which actually ends up making the problem really obvious a lot of the time.
[18:49:14] <BillCriswell> ahhughes: You can do like... var popup = window.open(url); if( popup ){ /* Yay! */ } else { /* Shit */ }
[18:49:58] <ahhughes> BillCriswell: shit yeaaaah! thanks
[18:50:08] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:50:58] <BillCriswell> This Salinger documentary is awesome.
[18:51:40] <Jeab> Bill: It works on jsbin, and not on the site :(
[18:52:04] <BillCriswell> Jeab: That should make tracking down the issue much easier, eh?
[18:53:24] <Jeab> Not really :(
[19:03:03] <BillCriswell> Jeab: Are there any errors in your console?
[19:03:37] <Jeab> none
[19:03:46] <Jeab> which is the really confusing part
[19:04:54] <BillCriswell> Jeab: Hmmm... selector issue?
[19:06:42] <Jeab> literally copy and pasted into the jsbin and it worked :/
[19:11:47] <BillCriswell> Jeab: Are you trying to access files locally?
[19:21:59] <Jeab> BillCriswell: Can I send you a link?
[19:27:25] <m0sphere> http://pastebin.com/qZsWtaeA why won't clicking the cancelbtn set display:none but it will put the borders around the cancelbtn and parent?
[19:28:51] <monokrome> Hey. Does anyone know why my carousel's call to jQuery.fadeOut doesn't do any actual fading? http://meganlees.com
[19:29:05] <monokrome> Script is at: http://meganlees.com/scripts/main.js
[19:29:15] <monokrome> Script is at: http://meganlees.com/scripts/main.coffee if you prefer coffee.
[19:36:20] <shoky> monokrome: it's the last <li> that is shown at front, not the first
[19:36:39] <shoky> monokrome: the fadeOut is working (though the 'hide' parameter is wrong)
[19:37:40] <shoky> monokrome: so you probably want to change the appendTo  to prependTo  and the :first-child to :last-child
[19:38:38] <monokrome> shoky: Thanks, I did that in a demo I worked up and didn't realize it'd cause this issue. :)
[19:38:44] <monokrome> I was confused that it worked in one place and not the other!
[19:39:11] <asymm> ban me OP, i fucking dare u!!!!!!!!!!!
[19:39:31] <shoky> asymm: ok?
[19:39:44] <asymm> show urself OP
[19:41:48] <vladikoff> `shrug
[19:41:48] <b-ot> vladikoff: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:42:38] <jarray52> I made the following modification to jquery.reveal to attempt to enable a translucent background, but I'm getting an error message. What's wrong with this code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7670361
[19:42:59] <jarray52> The problem is the '-ms-filter'
[19:43:54] <shoky> don't try to animate that ;P
[19:44:08] <jarray52> shoky: Was that to me?
[19:44:16] <shoky> yeah
[19:45:55] <shoky> also that unlockModal() as argument looks suspicious
[19:47:03] <jarray52> shoky: That was previously there. The only thing that is new is "-ms-filter" :  "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=100)" stuff.
[19:49:16] <shoky> people on IE8 don't deserve opacity
[19:50:34] <lamarus> Why does <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (max-device-width: 768px)" href="/css/768.css" /> not work... if I remove the media="" it works
[19:52:14] <lamarus> sorry wrong channel
[19:54:21] <livingstn> What would be the best approach to fading in a background color for a certain class?
[19:54:39] <livingstn> certain element, that is
[19:55:27] <livingstn> when my header scrolls past a certain point, I want to fade in a background color on it
[19:57:11] <m0sphere> seriously, someone needs to look at my pastebin and solve this for me, i am going insane
[19:58:00] <m0sphere> i can't hide this f'ing div after displaying it
[19:58:21] <m0sphere> all the possible ways to remove classes, add classes, toggle display, none of them work
[20:00:37] <cam> Can I make an async function bob so that $("#id").bob().foo() will execute foo() after bob? or should I do a when/done?
[20:02:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how goes it
[20:10:18] <Jeab> what would cause a click event to not go off if there are no errors in console
[20:11:02] <randomdrake> Jeab: maybe you attached it to the wrong element.
[20:11:10] <randomdrake> Or misspelled it.
[20:13:02] <Jeab> nope, works in a fiddle just not on the site
[20:13:04] <Jeab> hm
[20:24:59] <shoky> m0sphere: code looks ok. make a jsfiddle
[20:38:18] <m0sphere> http://jsfiddle.net/q4CFH/
[20:38:30] <m0sphere> i don't get itttttttt :(
[20:39:40] <m0sphere> ffs i think i just realize why
[20:40:17] <m0sphere> its because cancelbtn is still within the rowcontainer class which onclick shows it
[20:40:24] <m0sphere> so it hides then shows immediately
[20:40:47] <m0sphere> what a fucker
[20:41:03] <shoky> m0sphere:  http://jsfiddle.net/q4CFH/1/
[20:41:59] <m0sphere> so the e.stopPropagation(); is what fixes it?
[20:42:12] <shoky> yes
[20:42:24] <shoky> the click event was bubbling up and triggering yyour other listener too
[20:42:34] <m0sphere> yeaaaa
[20:42:36] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/q4CFH/2/
[20:43:13] <m0sphere> ty!
[20:43:32] <cam> can I use a jquery object as a key for a value in a relational array?
[20:43:45] <m0sphere> i've seriously been trying to display and hide that shit all the ways i could find for like 5 hours
[20:43:52] <m0sphere> i was wanting to punch something
[20:43:52] <m0sphere> lol
[20:44:02] <shoky> cam: only strings can be keys
[20:44:39] <cam> Hrm...
[20:44:44] <cam> Well it's /working/ using an object as a key.
[20:44:51] <cam> But it's not letting me retreive the value.
[20:45:03] <cam> Is there a way to generate a unique hash from an element?
[20:45:27] <shoky> what for?
[20:45:43] <shoky> maybe you just need .data() ?
[20:45:47] <cam> I need a unique way to refer to an element.
[20:45:51] <shoky> so store data related to an element
[20:45:55] <cam> I have {object1 : object2}
[20:46:16] <cam> no not .data.
[20:47:16] <shoky> well you can give them ids or some unique class or attribute
[20:47:36] <cam> I want to account for elements that do not have classes or attributes or idies.
[20:47:38] <cam> *id's
[20:49:04] <shoky> you can add data to them yourself
[20:49:33] <cam> hrm... shoky I have one function that takes an item and sticks it in a relational array using "this" (the caller) as the key. I want to have another function that can pull out the element using the caller again.
[20:50:00] <shoky> code speaks better than words
[20:50:16] <cam> The code doesn't exist because jquery doesn't have a damn hashing method for objects.
[20:50:33] * randomdrake blinks.
[20:51:52] <cam> ah, .uniqueId().... there we go.
[20:52:36] <cam> forget it, it's time for bed, gn all.
[20:52:42] <shoky> that's what i said - add your own data to them
[21:38:39] * Jeab blanks
[22:39:37] <Nuro-> anyone want to plaY?
[22:39:42] <Nuro-> besides marth players
[23:01:47] <moldy84> with a jquery deferred will $.when resolve after the .then finishes or before?
[23:17:58] <SuperTyp> hi all
[23:18:22] <SuperTyp> i have a menu that slides on click hidden content in
[23:18:48] <SuperTyp> for this I use the jquery UI function .slide()
[23:19:32] <SuperTyp> no I have 5 menu points and this would mean 5! combinations I have to cover with if clausels
[23:20:12] <SuperTyp> is there a better way to identify which content is currently shown and which should be slide in?
[23:22:10] <Cork> SuperTyp: i would use classes on the outer most element in the slide
[23:28:25] <SuperTyp> cork and then?
[23:28:52] <Cork> SuperTyp: well you can select elements based on if they have the "expanded" class or not
[23:28:57] <SuperTyp> i do use ids to slide them in and out but these are 60 combinations to cover
[23:29:17] <Cork> ya, if you use class you can just use relation selectors
[23:29:42] <SuperTyp> whats that?
[23:29:43] <Cork> menu.find('.expanded').slideUp(300).removeClass('expanded').addClass('collapsed')
[23:29:53] <Cork> (for collapsing)
[23:30:33] <SuperTyp> so I set and remove classes?
[23:30:39] <Cork> yes
[23:31:30] <SuperTyp> well thx its the solution :D
[23:32:17] <SuperTyp> now I only have 5 posibilities to cover, awesome mate
[23:41:58] <SuperTyp> anybody knows a gooid iOS irc client
[23:45:35] <_rgn> irccloud, but it costs money
[23:46:09] <SuperTyp> jailbreak lawl
[23:46:55] <_rgn> doesn't matter
[23:47:30] <SuperTyp> ah its a online thing right?
