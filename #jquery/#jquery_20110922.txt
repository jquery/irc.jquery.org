[00:06:53] <is_null> hi all, how come after slideDown(), an element is not is(':visible') ?
[00:07:21] <is_null> after it's down sliding down of course ... i'm checking is(':visible') in another, later click event
[00:08:01] <is_null> hell, even with show() instead of slideDown the issue persists ...
[00:08:01] <chrislabeard> Is there a way to calculate the width of some li's floated left so I can center the UL?
[00:08:56] <thomedy> oddly enough i havent found 1 single example to help me through this... basically what im trying to do is once my mouseup event fires i want the current e.pageX cursor position to be remembered...  everytime i thinkk i have an idea  i realize that im retarded
[00:09:40] <coldhead> is_null: that really shouldn't be so
[00:12:18] <thomedy> the only waythat i  can think of to remember is to create a varialble and then when i want to start from that place again and let e.pageX build more again i would have to subract e.pageX - e.pageX. and then after to use the cursor movement to build it again is e.page + all that... do you see the problem im having.. i would like to think its a lack of language skills i have i think its more i cant focus
[00:13:28] <coldhead> is_null: http://jsfiddle.net/dEaRb/
[00:14:00] <coldhead> thomedy: try putting something together on jsfiddle and someone will ehlp
[00:14:02] <coldhead> help*

[00:14:42] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/psRS7/3/
[00:16:00] <coldhead> try harder :)
[00:16:10] <coldhead> some comments or something around the relevant parts
[00:16:45] <thomedy> what youll see is the foundation... but what i need is for the block to stay there... and then where ever i click it should start from where its at
[00:17:24] <bobdobbs> Hi all. Weird problem: loading jquery locks up my browser. Testing on firefox and chrome.
[00:17:36] <laidback_01_> hey, I'd like to load a snippet of html to a div on a right click.  What function do i read about to do the loading and placement?
[00:17:48] <bobdobbs> Sometimes trying to stop the script execution in ff even crashes ff.
[00:18:04] <bobdobbs> Has anyone encountered this before?
[00:18:40] <coldhead> god no, bobdobbs
[00:18:44] <coldhead> that's a massive showstopper
[00:18:50] <coldhead> do you have a link to this behaviour?
[00:19:15] <bobdobbs> coldhead: If it would help, I can put up a jsfiddle.
[00:19:21] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[00:19:26] <ProLoser|Work> i found a relatively annoying bug in tmpl
[00:19:49] <bobdobbs> coldhead: I'm still doing some local testing at the moment. I'm testing on the latest version.
[00:20:00] <ProLoser|Work> apparently, on webkit and when looping and issuing multiple templates using similar keyed data, i get a bunch of problems with non-existent keys
[00:20:04] <ProLoser|Work> it's very hard to describe
[00:20:19] <bobdobbs> coldhead: the behaviour occours with both the normal and the compressed version.
[00:20:49] <bobdobbs> I was getting the freezes with cdn's, so I started loading the script locally.
[00:21:11] <bobdobbs> But I'm getting the freezes from a local load of jquery as well.
[00:21:13] <coldhead> how latest?
[00:21:24] <coldhead> 1.6.4 or git?
[00:21:29] <bobdobbs> jquery-1.6.4.js
[00:21:43] <coldhead> link it up
[00:21:55] <coldhead> you'd think if it was crashing browsers someone would have noticed
[00:21:58] <coldhead> before the release
[00:22:00] <coldhead> :\
[00:22:20] <bobdobbs> Well, I haven't tested older versions yet.
[00:22:48] <bobdobbs> I haven't concluded that it's the lib causing the problem. It might be me doing something dumb. Or interesting. Or both.
[00:23:00] <newnick12345> bobdobbs: jsfiddle it .. ?
[00:23:13] <bobdobbs> newnick12345: k. One minute...
[00:25:22] <bobdobbs> newnick12345: actually, it might be more useful to put it on an actual server.
[00:25:37] <bobdobbs> I'll put it up on a server. This will take me about 5 mins...
[00:25:49] <newnick12345> ok
[00:29:01] <coldhead> doo do doo dee
[00:29:14] <bobdobbs> uploading now...
[00:30:12] <coldhead> oh uh ohhhh uh ohhhh
[00:30:57] <bobdobbs> coldhead: http://testing.sunil.co.nz/index2.html
[00:31:41] <bobdobbs> note, I haven't tested with older version of jq. I haven't tested on IE or safari yet either.
[00:31:54] <bobdobbs> Just firefox and chrome on linux so far.
[00:32:34] <coldhead> bobdobbs: probably has something to do with your infinite looop here
[00:32:35] <coldhead> while($("ul#master_menu li#list2").hover()){
[00:32:35] <coldhead> $(this).addClass('visible');
[00:32:35] <coldhead>     }
[00:33:01] <bobdobbs> doh.
[00:33:16] <bobdobbs> I'll remove the link to that script...
[00:34:03] <bobdobbs> aw man. I'm a dumbass.
[00:34:08] <bobdobbs> I think that fixes it.
[00:35:51] <newnick12345> :))
[00:36:19] <bobdobbs> Yeah - that fixes it.
[00:36:27] <bobdobbs> *self facepalm
[00:36:46] <bobdobbs> I'll be over here in the dunce corner
[00:37:05] <newnick12345> silly mistakes :)
[00:37:35] * bobdobbs dons dunce cap. 
[00:37:56] <coldhead> infinite loops are the bane of all programming languages
[00:38:11] <coldhead> the real take away message is how impressively quick i was to diagnose that
[00:38:21] <coldhead> i'm like a modern day joan of arc
[00:38:30] <coldhead> except male, old, obsese, alive and not french
[00:38:34] <coldhead> but in every other respect...
[00:38:37] <newnick12345> lol
[00:40:17] <discorpia> coldhead: constantly hearing the voice of god in your head and wielding a sword?
[00:41:00] <bobdobbs> Maybe looking like milla jovovich, while hearing the voice of dustin hoffman in your head?
[00:41:06] <coldhead> yes! exactly!
[00:42:19] <bobdobbs> I kinda liked that version. First half was boring. The second half was intensly weird and provided a kind of mirror for the myth to look back t itself.
[00:42:44] <bobdobbs> Also, cool armour and weapons
[00:44:43] <muzone> coldhead: would you have done this any differently? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jgVFj/2/
[00:51:20] <thomedy> is there a way to get the cursor position out side of mousemove
[00:54:11] <nail_> thomedy: pageX/Y are available no matter what's the event
[00:57:11] <lazyPower> coldhead: that is by far the most obtuse reference i've seen all day.... I'LL BUY IT!
[00:58:44] <muzone> At my world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map (http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jgVFj/6/) - why won't my new SVG map render? My code is a complete mess also - is thre anything you guys would do to tidy it up?
[00:58:46] <thomedy> yeah i know i got that in now
[00:58:51] <thomedy> i found that googling
[00:58:52] <coldhead> muzone: i would have avoided whatever is causing this: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[00:59:14] <thomedy> what im attempting is to use pageX in mouseup()
[00:59:27] <thomedy> and save the cursorposition ina variable up top
[00:59:41] <thomedy> then add pageX to it in mouse move again
[00:59:45] <muzone> coldhead: does it say what line thats at?
[00:59:50] <thomedy> that makes sense to me... but its not quite wroking right
[00:59:58] <coldhead> 41?
[01:00:01] <coldhead> i closed the window
[01:04:27] <muzone> coldhead: its gone now right? http://home.no/dwaynie/map
[01:06:40] <DarsVaeda> Hi, I try to add a datepicker to one element, I log the selector return for that element and it gets selected correct but if I attach a datepicker to it, nothing happens, the field of the datepicker is inside a $.dialog() and a normal <input type="text"> ... any idea?
[01:10:51] <coldhead> no it's still there muzone
[01:10:54] <coldhead> it's this
[01:10:55] <coldhead> scandinavia = xml.find({
[01:10:56] <coldhead>           "#no", "#se", "#dk", "#is";
[01:11:04] <coldhead> that's no kinda syntax
[01:11:45] <muzone> i see..
[01:12:02] <muzone> what would you do in this case coldhead?
[01:12:20] <ProLoser|Work> How would you do this if there were more than 2 peices??? var peices = this.name.split('.'); obj[peices[0]][peices[1]] = this.value
[01:12:39] <ProLoser|Work> like, how can i make it more flexible?
[01:16:50] <muzone> mr coldhead?
[01:16:58] <coldhead> miss
[01:17:13] <muzone> alright miss coldhead
[01:17:29] <coldhead> i don't know what the funcion is expecting
[01:17:47] <coldhead> an array is "foo", "bar", "pants", "aids", "lol"
[01:18:14] <coldhead> an object is {"foo": "bar", "pants": false, "aids": "lol"}
[01:18:24] <coldhead> you probably want one or the other
[01:20:29] <muzone> coldhead: basically im trying to group together the different countries in the SVG into regions
[01:20:59] <muzone> coldhead: adapted, if you will, from an email i received yesterday from the raphaeljs-worldmap author: "denmark = xml.find('#dk path')  //get all paths in denmark group"
[01:21:50] <muzone> (i gotta use this xml stuff because i wanna load an external svg as opposed to an inline one like in the raphaeljs-worldmap demo)
[01:25:11] <muzone> coldhead: pants => aids => lol?
[01:25:28] <muzone> damn that is dark and twisted..
[01:26:27] <red> Can I somehow prevent DOM changes for an certain #wrapper and every children element of it via JS?
[01:27:20] <red> I've a problem of Colorbox clashing with one Drupal module, basicly when clicking a Colorbox thumbnail, it triggers some additional non-Colorbox events that duplicate some thumbnails and form submit/cancel buttons.
[01:27:27] <red> Can't figure out what for the life of me :/
[01:28:20] <coldhead> muzone: i don't know what the lib is expecting but if it's in {} it needs to be key: value, key:value, key:value form
[01:28:41] <muzone> nah i made the {}
[01:29:14] <muzone> figured it would be better than scandinavia = xml.find("#no path", "#se path", "#dk path", "#is path")
[01:29:36] <muzone> coldhead: you want a head massage?
[01:29:40] <muzone> i got warm hands
[01:30:01] <muzone> warm up that head of yours a little.. my way of saying thanks i guess
[01:30:27] <muzone> ravenzz! hey man
[01:30:40] * muzone funwrestles ravenzz before he goes to grab more coffee
[01:31:17] <coldhead> muzone: you probably just want .find("#thing, #thing, #thing")
[01:31:20] <coldhead> keep it simple
[01:31:59] <ravenzz> hey muzone sup
[01:33:06] <muzone> nice one coldhead, imma go for that

[01:47:34] <ProLoser|Work> or whomever
[01:47:49] <ProLoser|Work> something wrong with my syntax?
[01:48:43] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work the event must be within quotes
[01:48:47] <ravenzz> "click"
[01:49:12] <ravenzz> I would replace slideUp() with slideToggle()
[01:49:39] <ProLoser|Work> hmm... still not working
[01:49:47] <ProLoser|Work> maybe it's being unbineded?
[01:49:51] <ProLoser|Work> not sure
[01:50:22] <ravenzz> sorry the form should slide on click?
[01:50:32] <ProLoser|Work> that exaample works
[01:50:35] <ProLoser|Work> but mine doesn't
[01:50:46] <ProLoser|Work> i copied and pased the fix back too
[01:50:49] <ravenzz> Is it hosted somewhere?
[01:50:49] <muzone> ravenzz: actually whats wrong with var region(scandinavia = find("#no, #se, #dk, #is"); benelux = find("#be, #nl, #lu");); ?

[01:52:53] <ProLoser|Work> no it's not ruby
[01:52:56] <ProLoser|Work> all client side
[01:53:01] <ProLoser|Work> was hoping for dev tool
[01:53:07] <muzone> aha..
[01:53:23] <ProLoser|Work> cuz i'm dealing with iframes and single sign ons and bs like that
[01:53:24] <ravenzz> so var scandinavia = $('#no, #se, #dk, #is"'); if (scandinavia.length) region['scandinavia'] = scandinavia;
[01:53:25] <ravenzz> :o?
[01:53:27] <ProLoser|Work> or i mean single logins
[01:54:14] <muzone> ravenzz: cool! whats with the if though?
[01:55:29] <ravenzz> is a sort of exists? if it found those elements then it will add them to the region array

[02:20:21] <tktiddle> Hi im using jquery post() to submit a form but the http request is showing up as get on the back end, does anyone know why this might be?
[02:20:42] <Cork> ?p @ tktiddle
[02:20:43] <bot-t> tktiddle, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:24:21] <tktiddle> here it is http://pastie.org/2572862
[02:26:50] <Cork> tktiddle: do you see a get request in the net console too?
[02:27:03] <Cork> (btw, what browser are you using?)
[02:27:54] <tktiddle> Im using chrome, whats the net console?
[02:28:31] <Cork> toos > developer tools > Network
[02:30:38] <juha_> anyone got any good js snippet to detect what ie version user is running?
[02:31:11] <Cork> $.browsers.msie && $.browsers.version isn't enough for you?
[02:31:23] <Cork> *browser
[02:31:26] <juha_> oh there is .version, thanks!
[02:31:56] <juha_> should've checked the api docs first.. :P
[02:32:28] <tktiddle> Hmm chrome shows it as a get request
[02:32:48] <Cork> weird
[02:33:01] <Cork> try doing it with $.ajax
[02:33:32] <shomon> hi, how do I change the language used in yes no alerts?
[02:33:55] <shomon> does it depend on the language the server is in?
[02:34:27] <ravenzz> it depends on the browser language
[02:34:29] <Cork> ther should be reanslations js files if i remember correctly
[02:34:33] <ravenzz> so you can't
[02:34:42] <Cork> and ya, it depends on the users prefered language
[02:34:43] <shomon> aah so can I change the language on the browser to test that?
[02:34:59] <shomon> I've got someone in portugal who wants it in portuguese...
[02:35:15] <blackspotwiggins> shomon, they should install portuguese language browser then
[02:37:20] <shomon> and I can't hard code it? it's portuguese only really
[02:37:25] <blackspotwiggins> nope
[02:37:32] <shomon> :) thought not
[02:37:35] <shomon> thanks...
[02:37:36] <blackspotwiggins> you can use non-native popups/alerts
[02:40:07] <tktiddle> Does this look right? http://pastie.org/2572931 Its still submitting as get
[02:42:41] <tktiddle> OK i got it working now, for some reason it wanted all the inputs of the form before it would use POST
[02:43:52] <blackspotwiggins> tktiddle, couple of things
[02:44:09] <blackspotwiggins> you are binding to submit button. maybe the user just presses enter in one of the fields?
[02:44:18] <blackspotwiggins> bind to the forms submit handler
[02:44:45] <blackspotwiggins> and since you dont cancel the original submit event, you get two requests
[02:44:53] <blackspotwiggins> and form method="" -> get
[02:46:26] <tktiddle> does submit() cancel the original submit event?
[02:47:26] <blackspotwiggins> if you do e.preventDefault()
[02:47:31] <muzone> ravenzz: at http://home.no/dwaynie/map - any idea whats with the syntax error in :69?
[02:50:57] <lng> hi! how can I run ajax in loop with timeout?

Each region should be black when hovered, and launch .region_box when clicked. But so far, the map won't even show. Anybody know?
[02:51:50] <domcat> how cna I get pure html from this simple loop in the "images" variable instead of object? http://pastebin.com/GEe6t86K
[02:53:17] <domcat> any ideas?
[02:54:26] <ProLoser|Work> how can i see if $(this) is the descendant of something?
[02:54:50] <blackspotwiggins> ?.contains @ ProLoser|Work
[02:54:51] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:54:58] <blackspotwiggins> damn..
[02:55:02] <blackspotwiggins> ?$.contains
[02:55:04] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:55:20] <ProLoser|Work> but i want to go in reverse
[02:55:21] <blackspotwiggins> ProLoser|Work, http://www.jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.contains
[02:55:22] <ProLoser|Work> i have a subnode
[02:55:29] <ProLoser|Work> i want to inspect properties of a parent
[02:55:39] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, could not get the bot to cooperate on that one
[02:56:13] <blackspotwiggins> it works with pure dom elements
[02:56:18] <ProLoser|Work> only?
[02:56:21] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[02:56:25] <blackspotwiggins> it's crazy fast tho
[02:56:25] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[02:56:33] <blackspotwiggins> so just go this instead of $(this)
[02:56:50] <blackspotwiggins> and $("#container")[0] instead of $("#container")
[02:56:55] <ProLoser|Work> $.contains($('.someclass')[0], this)
[02:57:10] <ProLoser|Work> like that?
[02:57:42] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, provided you need the first of the ".someclass" selector
[02:57:58] <ProLoser|Work> :/
[02:58:02] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure
[02:58:04] <ProLoser|Work> i hope so lol
[02:58:14] <blackspotwiggins> if you want to know if it's under _any_ ".someclass" you need something else
[02:58:32] <blackspotwiggins> you're not sure?
[02:58:51] <nFFF> any ideas why console.log() isn't working for me?
[02:59:46] <ProLoser|Work> i hope there's only one instance of that class on the page lol
[03:00:08] <blackspotwiggins> you don't know that?

[03:00:38] <ProLoser|Work> lots of shitty devs on my team
[03:01:08] <maltray> i actually managed to make it work with position: fixed; on div #img, but that would show that div on the bottom
[03:03:20] <nFFF> any ideas why console.log() isn't working for me in Chrome is there a different syntax?

[03:12:49] <ProLoser|Work> i need to echo out the index of the loop i'm on in the template, including the mutual, sub-included template
[03:13:16] <maltray> lng: for what i know, i have used it that way, let me see i used it somewhere before
[03:13:50] <maltray> but try it, var to = setTimeout("foo()", 5000);
[03:13:58] <maltray> without the while
[03:14:07] <lng> ok
[03:16:27] <nFFF> Guys I need to pass a variable between two functions
[03:16:31] <nFFF> how do I do this?
[03:16:37] <lng> maltray: asignment doesn't make any difference
[03:17:45] <maltray> oops wrong lang on the pastie, anyways, this is how i did it before, and worked :p http://pastie.org/2573069
[03:18:32] <maltray> ur using that code on the $(document).ready(function(){ ... right?
[03:18:38] <lng> yes
[03:18:57] <maltray> try to adapt my version to yours and see if it works
[03:19:05] <discorpia> nFFF: what kind of variable? you can do it in several ways, how are the functions called?
[03:19:11] <lng> ok
[03:19:11] <maltray> it worked for me (sometimes idk why in chrome the timeout wont set, havent fixed that yet..)
[03:19:12] <lng> thanks
[03:19:19] <maltray> np
[03:23:11] <maltray> guys im gonna ask again, im sry :p but i just cant find the answer, i want that the image thats showing in here: http://190.134.61.33/conaprole/ when u click any of the items of the bottom, slide down (from top to down) and the slide up (from down to up) how can i do that?
[03:24:10] <smftre> Is it possible to modify a jquery dialog's title after it is shown on the screen?
[03:28:00] <IamTrying> How can i click action only after 80 seconds it was kept on press? e.g: $(TOUCH).live("click", function() { /*you pressed the touch screen for 80 seconds. now you get*/ alert(); } );
[03:28:47] <maltray> hum im thinking about set a timeout, and if he stops pressing it just clear the timeout
[03:29:12] <blackspotwiggins> who the hell clicks for 80 seconds
[03:29:21] <IamTrying> maltray, its a touch screen. So if you keep pressed on for 80 seconds > it shows a secret menu.
[03:29:42] <juha_> it's funny that jquery.com runs 1.4.2
[03:29:42] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, i am writing a bank touch screen application.
[03:31:10] <maltray> IamTrying: idk if the live("click" stays there if someone just clicks it and stand there, but i think that yah, so, in the function u would add a timeout for 80000, then as a callback function, u just clear that timeout
[03:31:29] <maltray> i dont know if u can do a callback function on live
[03:31:33] <maltray> but probably yes
[03:31:38] <blackspotwiggins> IamTrying, you can use click event
[03:31:45] <blackspotwiggins> you need touch events
[03:31:56] <blackspotwiggins> click happens instantly and only once
[03:32:12] <maltray> so it doesnt remain there black?
[03:32:21] <maltray> like, the event wont get stuck until the user leaves the click?
[03:32:27] <blackspotwiggins> you can't*
[03:32:30] <blackspotwiggins> i meant
[03:32:41] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, in the touch screen left top, right top, bottom right, bottom left if you press and hold 20 seconds, i have secret menu.
[03:33:02] <blackspotwiggins> that's fascinating..
[03:33:16] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, i am doing this with crestron/extron  maltray with pressed event.
[03:33:56] <maltray> so i guess pressed event has a callback, and remains in the function until u unpress it, right?
[03:34:04] <blackspotwiggins> wtf is pressed event?
[03:34:28] <maltray> idk, i dont know it but if it exists, there are so many things i dont know about jquery, lol.
[03:34:30] <IamTrying> never mind i will fix it, just wanted to avoid timeouts..
[03:34:46] <maltray> u has to love timeouts :p
[03:34:56] <maltray> and btw, its not secret if its on js though
[03:35:11] <blackspotwiggins> IamTrying, you dont need timeouts
[03:35:14] <maltray> if someone can reach the code, then he/she can also see the secret menu
[03:35:22] <blackspotwiggins> you need to record when the touch started and ended
[03:35:31] <blackspotwiggins> i think you can figure out the rest
[03:35:42] <maltray> that was a good one black
[03:36:11] <maltray> black, btw do u know anything about slideup and slidedowns?
[03:36:14] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, there will be hundreds of touch which one has which parameter?
[03:37:58] <blackspotwiggins> IamTrying, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Touch_events
[03:38:04] <blackspotwiggins> educate yourself
[03:38:39] <IamTrying> blackspotwiggins, thank you that was wise trigger :)
[03:43:23] <maltray> anyways..

[04:08:07] <reesefrancis> and I've modified the function header like this: addTinyMCE: function(parameter){ ... }
[04:08:13] <reesefrancis> how can I pass the additional parameter? shouldn't my code work?
[04:15:47] <lng> how to disable basic layout for some actions?
[04:23:33] <mourad> can any one tell me what is wrong with this selector $('label[for*="Vue_de_dessus_coupe"');
[04:26:13] <ProLoser|Work> why is it that if i have selected multiple items, but only trigger the event for ONE item, it still runs the number of items originally selected?

[05:07:13] <timing_> Guys, I need some advice :-). I have a user/groups page where an admin can drag and drop users in certain groups. The whole thing is ajax, so when you add a group it makes a call and updates the dom. However, now I have this in php: echo '<li>Cool Group</li>'; and when dynamically add a group I do append('<li>Cool Group</li>');
[05:07:20] <timing_> But now I want to add a span in the element
[05:07:23] <lng> oops
[05:07:26] <lng> sorry
[05:07:28] <lng> :-)
[05:07:44] <timing_> this means I have to update my php AND javascript. Isn't there a neat way to do this only ones?
[05:07:55] <timing_> Some best practices?
[05:08:23] <seutje> timing: doesn't ur js just append whatever php returns?
[05:08:56] <timing> seutje: my php returns json not html
[05:09:36] <seutje> still don't get the problem, but templates are prolly ur answer
[05:09:39] <timing> the <li has an attribute: data-groupid="" which I also fill in the callback
[05:10:05] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[05:10:08] <timing> seutje: the problem is that I have two places where I render the list of groups

[05:19:39] <big-os> it doesn't have to be left:100%, just any setting outside current viewport

[05:22:29] <w4r10ck> asdfasf
[05:24:57] <yogurt_truck> did they really make a PHP (the language) vs. Rails (the framework) comparison, and made a video of it?
[05:25:26] <yogurt_truck> is that what i just saw?
[05:26:05] <markz> had anybody else had problem with $(el).removeAttr("disabled") in ie6? cant solve this in any way ...
[05:26:27] <whoru> anyone had used Twitter Bootstrap here?
[05:26:45] <whoru> I am getting error $.fn.twipsy is undefined
[05:27:04] <muzone> yogurt_truck: Yes
[05:27:21] <muzone> yogurt_truck: But it's a fair assessment. They might as well compare CakePHP vs Ruby, and the case would still ring the same.
[05:27:29] <whoru> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[05:27:44] <muzone> * SymphonyPHP vs ruby
[05:27:55] <muzone> or whatever you catch my drift
[05:28:07] <whoru> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#twipsy
[05:28:31] <muzone> But I understand the point of view of those who immediately blurp out "DID THEY REALLY COMPARE PHP TO A FRAMEWORK"
[05:28:52] <yogurt_truck> muzone: Not a fair assessment at all. The guy specifically talks about the sql + html spaghetti code that is commonly found in crappy plain no-framework PHP code. A fair comparison would be something like Kohana vs. Rails, and the case would not ring the same at all. So yeah, they pretty much fail at comparisons
[05:29:13] <muzone> These are people who have spent their entire lives learning PHP, and who are too proud to admit something better has come along. Perfectly understandable - the ego is a powerful thing.
[05:30:02] <yogurt_truck> muzone: nope, i think the video is idiotic, and I do both rails and php frameworks, and love both things
[05:30:16] <yogurt_truck> and i also prefer ruby as a language
[05:30:35] <yogurt_truck> and i still think the video is ultra retarded
[05:31:37] <lz> php was never designed to operate the way people use it these days
[05:32:02] <yogurt_truck> lz: php was never designed :>
[05:32:29] <lz> it was designed to run one guys home page
[05:32:29] <big-os> what a bold statement on a channel about JAVASCRIPT
[05:34:15] <yogurt_truck> it started as a bunch of C libraries to make templating easier, and over time they added more functionality, and eventually the current OOP features which give people the capabilities to implement MVC and separation of concerns, so nowadays there's no excuse for writing spaghetti code in PHP
[05:37:33] <yogurt_truck> hell, there was no excuse back then either... when it didn't have OOP stuff...

[05:51:42] <Azrael_-> any hints?
[05:53:48] <flochtililoch> hi guys
[05:54:03] <Cork> Azrael_-: a quick look looks like it might be a bug in there minizimed release
[05:54:12] <flochtililoch> struggling to find an answer to my question, regarding .post() method
[05:54:15] <Cork> Azrael_-: try there uncompressed version
[05:54:32] <Cork> Azrael_-: and check for js errors
[05:55:24] <flochtililoch> i would like to post some data to an url, without having an existing form on my page, and let the browser follow the post url (so no ajax call), any idea what's the best solution and if jquery can come handy in that scenario ?
[05:56:11] <Cork> flochtililoch: you have to construct a form through js
[05:56:15] <Cork> and then submit it
[05:56:53] <flochtililoch> ok i was expecting that the post method would let me do this somehow
[05:56:57] <Etcha> part
[05:57:17] <Cork> flochtililoch: nope, the elements are needed
[05:57:28] <flochtililoch> cool thx for your help
[05:57:30] <Cork> flochtililoch: there isn't a pist method
[05:57:37] <Cork> *post
[05:57:51] <Cork> if you mean $.post, its a short hand for $.ajax
[05:58:05] <flochtililoch> yeah i was talking about this one indeed
[05:58:07] <flochtililoch> ok
[05:59:55] <Azrael_-> Cork: no js errors occur. otherwise i'd have reported them
[06:01:20] <Cork> Azrael_-: try the uncompressed library

[06:10:46] <elwardi> any one good with selectors and can help me out in the following :
[06:12:41] <elwardi> i wish to select some labels that have just the attribute "for" and i tried $('label[for*="Some_text_Here"') but it is just not working
[06:12:50] <elwardi> any other suggession on how to do it
[06:12:52] <elwardi> ?
[06:17:26] <quicksilver> elwardi: $('label[for]') is correct, yes.
[06:17:36] <quicksilver> what you pasted had a mssing ]
[06:18:42] <elwardi> right, how dumb i am, thank you thank you quicksilver
[06:19:17] <elwardi> haha jacky-chan like thanks :)
[06:19:52] <johnline3> i have thise line: $('#home #overlay').hover(function() {
[06:20:01] <johnline3> can i do this $('#home #overlay') (function() {
[06:20:57] <quicksilver> johnline3: why would you want to? what are you trying to do?
[06:21:06] <quicksilver> incidentally '#home #overlay' is the same as '#overlay'
[06:21:43] <johnline3> nvm, im an idiot :Ð
[06:21:53] <johnline3> setTimeout(function() { i'll use this
[06:23:43] <phrearch> hey
[06:24:06] <Azrael_-> Cork: debugging didn't show any errors. the opacity is set to the group.group.fill elements. also works but i don't see any visual change
[06:24:10] <phrearch> is it possible to assign css class values for future elements?
[06:24:21] <phrearch> like $('.CodeMirror-selected').css('background-color',ce.editor_colors[user.id]);
[06:24:31] <phrearch> but then automagically, like delegate
[06:25:33] <quicksilver> phrearch: how about you put an entry in your CSS, like ".CodeMirror-selected { background-color: .. blah ... } " ? ;)
[06:25:44] <Azrael_-> one of the strangest things: the script works locally when run on the included webserver of visual studio but when i run it on a remote server it doesn't work. the spiner itself standalone works just fine. dunno where to continue searching
[06:26:56] <kavillock> it jQuery('#usc-'+val).attr('checked', true); works ??
[06:29:57] <phrearch> quicksilver: yea the only option and the best probably
[06:30:20] <guy> I don't understand why [selector].show() doesn't work in this scenario. It is not a first time that I get into such problem, therefore, I thought I will just come here and ask!
[06:30:20] <guy> http://dev2.anuary.com/peter-joseph/2011%2009%2015%20membership%20form/
[06:30:40] <guy> see the very bottom of the page :the radio select. and then refer to default.js
[06:30:53] <sr972> could someone please take a look at http://sr972.privatepaste.com/581071d485 ... i got a "getCustomers is not defined" in firebug..
[06:30:58] <guy> .show() doesn't work, but! removeClass('hidden') does work just fine.
[06:32:40] <guy> sr972: it is because var func =$("#Filter").attr('rel'); returns string. not sure though how to make it work. try func + '()'
[06:32:56] <sr972> guy: tried and failed ^^
[06:33:24] <guy> are 100% sure that the function is defined in the scope?
[06:33:30] <sr972> yeah
[06:34:07] <guy> try window["functionName"](arguments);
[06:34:16] <guy> so, instead of "functionName" fucn
[06:34:19] <guy> func*
[06:35:24] <jeffsmykil> where am i going awry?  var clickedClass = this.id.attr("class");
[06:35:44] <sr972> still getCustomers is not defined
[06:35:44] <sr972> [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten] search_timer = setTimeout(func, delay);
[06:35:58] <guy> sr972: live demo link?
[06:36:18] <sr972> can give ya one
[06:36:21] <sr972> mom
[06:36:55] <guy> jeffsmykil: pastebin the context.
[06:37:36] <jeffsmykil> guy: http://pastebin.com/xmMgPwt3
[06:38:02] <guy> jeffsmykil: just $(this).attr('class') instead of this.id.attr('class')
[06:38:11] <jeffsmykil> oh wow
[06:38:12] <jeffsmykil> im a moron
[06:38:14] <jeffsmykil> i knew that
[06:38:48] <sr972> guy .. check query ^^
[06:38:49] <jeffsmykil> someone hit me with a clue stick
[06:39:55] <guy> sr972: search_timer = setTimeout(func, delay);  replace with search_timer = setTimeout(window[func], delay);
[06:40:32] <sr972> guy: i did oO mom
[06:40:37] <guy> p.s. don't use rel="" to pass that information. use html5 data-*, e.g. data-callback="[..]"
[06:40:55] <guy> no, you didn't. I don't see it anywhere in the code.
[06:41:37] <guy> Andy-: afaik, you are smart with jQuery. Mind looking at my code?
[06:42:20] <jeffsmykil> which function lets you split a string at a certain charachter?
[06:42:34] <guy> jeffsmykil: substr
[06:42:34] <jeffsmykil> lol split
[06:42:37] <sr972> guy: cant use html5 cause not all will have a html5 compatible browser
[06:42:59] <guy> sr972: data-* will work cross browser. It is just HTML5 standard.
[06:43:08] <sr972> guy: and wired.. changed the code serveral times, but still the same old ***.. mom
[06:43:38] <guy> no idea what "mom" means in your language, though stop saying that.
[06:44:34] <Segaja> guy: but not every browser uses the HTML5 standard yet
[06:44:53] <sr972> mom = moment pls :)
[06:44:54] <guy> Segaja: will it make data-* to stop loading the page/causes errors? no.
[06:45:47] <guy> ew. Found a disgusting feature of jQuery. Seems like if .hidden{display:none!important;} $('.hidden').show() won't work.
[06:47:39] <nwb001> hey there, can some one tell me why are my object properties getting undefined in the event's function on this snipet http://snipt.org/xnmY ? tnhx!
[06:47:53] <smplstk> guy, that makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
[06:48:10] <sr972> guy: useless setTimeout call (missing quotes around argument?) search_timer = setTimeout(window[func], delay);
[06:49:36] <guy> smplstk: not to me. Javascript makes changes on CSS-applied dom. Therefore, any !important rule should be ignored.
[06:50:48] <erichynds> ?gl
[06:50:49] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[06:52:24] <sr972> guy: any other ideas?
[06:52:33] <smplstk> guy: you should check out the API
[06:52:35] <smplstk> Note: If using !important in your styles, such as display: none !important, it is necessary to override the style using .css('display', 'block !important') should you wish for .show() to function correctly.
[06:52:37] <smplstk> ^^
[06:52:42] <Brodingo> guy author important declarations supercede inline user declarations
[06:53:02] <Brodingo> so it makes perfect sense
[06:54:19] <guy> Brodingo: didn't know that inline declaration is superceded by !important; sr972 no idea. It should work as far as I know JS.
[06:54:44] <Brodingo> just because two guys in IRC didnt know doesnt mean it should work how you think
[06:54:58] <Brodingo> JS
[06:55:09] <Seus> getting a text area's height isn't returning with $('#id').height(); do I need to use something different??
[06:55:42] <scribe> Hey guys.  Basic jquery / js question for you.  what's the difference between var $dialog = $('#mydialog'); and var dialog = $('#mydialog')
[06:56:04] <Brodingo> theres a dollar sign in that first variable
[06:56:07] <Brodingo> WHAT DO I WIN?
[06:56:20] <miketaylr> a sandwich
[06:56:23] <Brodingo> WOOOOO
[06:56:24] <Seus> lol a cookie?
[06:56:27] <scribe> Brodingo, :)  yeah.  And an accidental missing ';' at the end.
[06:56:28] <miketaylr> scribe: no difference
[06:56:34] <scribe> ok, cool.
[06:56:35] <scribe> thanks
[06:56:40] <Brodingo> ill take a california club
[06:56:45] <Brodingo> and dont skimp on that guac
[06:56:45] <miketaylr> some people like to put $ on their jQuery collection vars
[06:56:47] <miketaylr> just a convention
[06:57:00] <miketaylr> jeeze, that's gonna cost me like 8 bucks
[06:57:00] <scribe> miketaylr, thank you.
[06:57:07] <Brodingo> and i want my bacon crispy godamnit
[06:57:13] <discorpia> scribe: nothing. $ is simply a valid character for variable names. some people use it designated for specific types of variables but there is no "standard"
[06:57:54] <scribe> discorpia, ok, so it actually becomes part of the variable name?  so, i couldn't access $dialog with simply dialog?
[06:58:14] <discorpia> scribe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1661197/valid-characters-for-javascript-variable-names
[06:58:18] <discorpia> scribe: exactly
[06:58:28] <nwb001> hey there, can some one tell me why are my object properties getting undefined in the event's function on this snipet http://snipt.org/xnmY ? tnhx!
[06:58:36] <scribe> discorpia, perfect.  Thanks.  That's helpful to know about js.
[06:58:50] <discorpia> scribe: most unicode (some restrictions applies) are valid characters for variables in javascript, check the third reply for funky examples =)
[06:59:08] <Brodingo> scribe if you want to learn more about other conventions/fundementals of jquery

[07:05:43] <nwb001> hey
[07:06:06] <nwb001> anyone know how to pass object attributes to a jquery event function?
[07:18:35] <darcyclarke> nwb001 $("a").click(function(theEvent, theElement){ theElement = $(this); var someAttribute = theElement.attr('href'); }); <-- an example
[07:20:19] <b-lew> am I declaring this right? var three = "stuart"; "three".substring(0,3);
[07:21:58] <muzone> Brodingo: hello
[07:21:59] <discorpia> b-lew: you probably wnat   three.substring(0,3) not "three", or else you get "thr" instead of "stu" returned
[07:22:09] <muzone> Brodingo: is it true i cant import svg files to raphaeljs?
[07:25:28] <anli_> Is it true that it is problematic to receive null values in json using internet explorer?
[07:25:43] <anli_> they seem to become "null", although it may be something in my code thats wrong rather
[07:25:46] <Brodingo> muzone i used that site, readysetraphael.com
[07:26:21] <muzone> Brodingo: but what if you need to use an .svg file?
[07:26:47] <Brodingo> uhh im not sure i havent done that
[07:26:50] <muzone> Brodingo: i found https://github.com/wout/raphael-svg-import but it seems kinda, i dont know
[07:27:33] <muzone> i dont understand why something like this isnt in raphaeljs. and curious if it will be in raphaeljs 2.0?
[07:27:44] <muzone> nobodys answering in #raphaeljs or in their google group though
[07:28:17] <b-lew> See if you can save those letters to a variable named three using the substring()method from above.
[07:28:28] <b-lew> var three = "bryan"; three.substring(0,3);
[07:28:32] <b-lew> thats right isn't it?
[07:29:05] <discorpia> b-lew: yes, to get bry
[07:29:15] <discorpia> "bry"
[07:29:28] <b-lew> yea, i'm getting a "Oops, try again."
[07:29:33] <b-lew> wonder why
[07:29:58] <StPiere> how to submit form again after using e.preventDefault() in .onsubmit() ?
[07:30:09] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[07:30:27] <aaronmcadam> been trying to make jquery cycle not show all slides at once and nothing is working
[07:31:31] <johnline3> all slides at once?
[07:31:46] <johnline3> dont you have to set them all to display:none; in the css?
[07:32:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah :(
[07:32:09] <aaronmcadam> but it keeps bloody showing em
[07:32:15] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying a custom effect
[07:32:39] <aaronmcadam> and if I don't put display : block in the cssBefore, they don't show at all
[07:32:48] <aaronmcadam> so I dunno
[07:33:09] <StPiere> anyone?
[07:33:25] <aaronmcadam> I'll make a fiddle
[07:33:42] <StPiere> anyone?
[07:33:44] <johnline3> im looking to abandon cycle on my site, i have a simple fadeshow, im pretty sure a few lines of jq can do the same
[07:33:57] <johnline3> less http requests
[07:35:04] <Aamir> ?submit @StPiere
[07:35:04] <bot-t> StPiere, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[07:35:45] <Aamir> StPiere:  to catch the submit event use  yoruform.submit(function(e){ .. }); to submit a form  yourform.submit()
[07:36:51] <aaronmcadam> johnline3: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/xpxce/
[07:36:55] <aaronmcadam> any ideas?
[07:37:34] <Aamir> aaronmcadam: its working
[07:37:38] <aaronmcadam> no
[07:37:43] <aaronmcadam> it works after a few second
[07:37:47] <aaronmcadam> it's the inital load
[07:38:06] <aaronmcadam> the text all displays over each other
[07:39:18] <aaronmcadam> Aamir, johnline3 http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/xpxce/
[07:39:48] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/E5S4p/  I want to get the user name of the current div when I drop from available to languages
[07:40:10] <aaronmcadam> I've tried loadsa shit
[07:41:00] <aaronmcadam> trying to figure out what I'm missing
[07:42:00] <webdev5> aaron, what is wrong with what you have?
[07:42:10] <aaronmcadam> watch it when it loads
[07:42:15] <aaronmcadam> all the slides display over each other
[07:42:34] <webdev5> ahh yes ok
[07:42:40] <guy> how to check if radio input is checked?
[07:42:41] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[07:42:47] <aaronmcadam> is(':checked')
[07:43:45] <ajpiano> StPiere: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/5tCp3/6/
[07:43:48] <ajpiano> something like that should work
[07:44:03] <ajpiano> prevent the default and then trigger the underlying submit later
[07:44:25] <aaronmcadam> hiya ajpiano, can you have a quick look at this please for me: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/xpxce/ I'm using a jquery cycle custom effect and the slides all appear over each other on load
[07:44:36] <aaronmcadam> I've added the css but it's not effecting it seemingly
[07:45:54] <Aamir> ajpiano:  .submit() will not trigger .submit(functionâ¦ ?
[07:45:58] <aaronmcadam> it's as if it's applying the cssBefore option before it actually starts the cycle
[07:46:13] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: not if you trigger native submit
[07:46:18] <ccmonsters> morning folks.
[07:46:27] <seutje> ajpiano: u clever dog
[07:46:27] <Aamir> ah ok..
[07:46:41] <ajpiano> seutje: :D
[07:46:47] <Aamir> :)
[07:46:50] <ajpiano> this why i save all my useful pastes so i can use again later
[07:47:03] <seutje> I usually put a class on the form to make it in the process of submitting
[07:47:13] <Aamir> ajpiano:  save it as  ?delay submit
[07:47:14] <ccmonsters> a particular way suggested to handle cookies? certain plugin?
[07:47:14] <Aamir> ?
[07:47:15] <seutje> and then I just check for the presence of that class
[07:47:50] <Aamir> ?g jquery cookie plugin
[07:47:51] <bot-t> Aamir, Cookie | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[07:47:57] <Aamir> @ccmonsters  ^
[07:48:06] <seutje> like if (!$this.hasClass('submitting')) { e.preventDefault(); }
[07:48:12] <ccmonsters> I believe i can do this with basic js though.
[07:48:18] <ccmonsters> document.cookie .... etc
[07:48:22] <nwb001> darcyclarke:  tnhx!
[07:48:27] <ccmonsters> didn't know if anything was built into jquery
[07:48:35] <dpy> hi guys
[07:48:47] <Hooloovoo> hi dpy
[07:48:51] <aaronmcadam> anyone tried to use a jquery cycle custom effect?
[07:49:00] <aaronmcadam> having an issue with mine
[07:49:07] <Aamir> seutje:  thats another good idea :)
[07:49:08] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: i think it's something to do with this cssBefore thing
[07:49:10] <aaronmcadam> all slides load over each other
[07:49:10] <dpy> Say, does anyone know how to reference the iterated data within a nested template?   (see: http://jsbin.com/epulec/2/edit#source )
[07:49:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah me too
[07:49:26] <aaronmcadam> I dunno if malsup frequents this place
[07:49:30] <Hooloovoo> seems like jquery templates are hot now
[07:49:37] <Hooloovoo> need to have a look at them later
[07:50:53] <aaronmcadam> any idea at all ajpiano, I've tried messing with a few things
[07:51:14] <aaronmcadam> maybe there's a beforeStart callback
[07:51:34] <ajpiano> not really, i'm just poking at things
[07:51:41] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[07:51:43] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, you are at linux right?
[07:51:46] <aaronmcadam> ye
[07:51:49] <blackspotwiggins> mind if i pm?
[07:51:51] <aaronmcadam> k
[07:52:28] <dpy> any jquery template gurus hanging around ?
[07:52:46] <ccmonster> dpy, plenty. Just ask your question and someone will help you if able.
[07:52:59] <dpy> ccmonster: the question was already asked...
[07:53:10] <dpy> "[...] does anyone know how to reference the iterated data within a nested template?   (see: http://jsbin.com/epulec/2/edit#source )"
[07:54:07] <ccmonster> I've not messed with templates. Someone will help you if able/time willing
[07:55:32] <darcyclarke> nwb001 no problemo
[07:55:33] <seutje> what do u guys usually use to get the same input elements on every browser?
[07:55:34] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: could u take a quick look at this for me: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/xpxce/
[07:55:46] <aaronmcadam> jquery cycle custom effect
[07:56:07] <ccmonster> what you want me to critique?
[07:56:18] <aaronmcadam> no, I'm trying to fix an issue
[07:56:30] <aaronmcadam> it ignores the css because of cssBefore callback i think
[07:56:50] <aaronmcadam> trying to think of a way round it
[07:57:10] <ccmonster> what's it ignoring. Sorry, im multi tasking.
[07:57:19] <aaronmcadam> the cssBefore function
[07:57:23] <ccmonster> and ive not messed with cycle to much.
[07:57:28] <aaronmcadam> ok
[07:57:33] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: it isn't a function :p
[07:57:36] <ccmonster> display:block
[07:57:37] <aaronmcadam> i kno
[07:57:44] <aaronmcadam> you know what i mean adam :P haha
[07:57:47] <ccmonster> lol
[07:57:56] <aaronmcadam> yea
[07:58:11] <aaronmcadam> it's only meant to use that for each slide in the slideshow
[07:58:24] <aaronmcadam> but it's as if it's applying it before it even starts
[07:58:46] <ccmonster> Yea. they are all listed block
[07:59:03] <aaronmcadam> hmm actually I may be confused, it might be setting them all up before it runs
[07:59:13] <aaronmcadam> i might need the before callback instead
[07:59:23] <ccmonster> It might apply apply CssBefore to all elements in the cycle?
[07:59:31] <aaronmcadam> it might do!
[07:59:37] <aaronmcadam> looks like that's what's happening
[07:59:42] <jeffsmykil> So changing the value of a select via select.val("foo") does not trigger the .change() event?
[07:59:43] <aaronmcadam>   cssBefore:     null,  // properties that define the initial state of the slide before transitioning in
[08:00:01] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: correct
[08:00:12] <ccmonster> yea, they all get set as pos: absolute,display:block, and its just altering zindex opacity and margins
[08:00:15] <muzone> Brodingo: do you know if theres a filesize limit to readysetraphael? i cant seem to convert http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World8.svg
[08:00:20] <aaronmcadam> yeah dude
[08:00:27] <ccmonster> that sucks.
[08:00:27] <aaronmcadam> thanks for looking :)
[08:00:42] <ccmonster> np. It's always something ...*sigh*
[08:00:49] <aaronmcadam> but I got the idea from the demo site
[08:00:55] <aaronmcadam> dunno how he's getting around it
[08:01:06] <ccmonster> does the animation look correct?
[08:01:21] <ccmonster> not sure what the desired effect is
[08:01:25] <aaronmcadam> oh ye
[08:01:34] <aaronmcadam> after a couple of secs it goes right
[08:01:39] <Brodingo> i dunno muzone
[08:01:50] <aaronmcadam> it's the bloody css that's messing the final touch :D
[08:01:57] <ccmonster> :/
[08:02:22] <ccmonster> That's a good sized svg muzone , that's all i know.
[08:02:38] <muzone> hehe
[08:04:15] <aaronmcadam> dammit this is a pain
[08:04:59] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster:
[08:05:02] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/adv.html
[08:07:15] <aaronmcadam> trying to see what malsup's doing that I'm not
[08:11:57] <aaronmcadam> ah i got it, sort of, set a bg on the list item
[08:12:09] <aaronmcadam> and set left : 0, top : 0 so they all stack on each other
[08:15:25] <kayam> hey sup guys
[08:15:49] <smplstk> sup sup
[08:19:07] <ccmonster> back
[08:19:21] <ccmonster> so what's it looking like now aaronmcadam
[08:19:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah working
[08:19:45] <aaronmcadam> bit of a hack but works
[08:19:50] <ccmonster> got a fiddle updated?
[08:19:51] <aaronmcadam> for this instance
[08:19:53] <aaronmcadam> nah
[08:19:57] <aaronmcadam> it's just setting a bg
[08:20:04] <aaronmcadam> on the list item
[08:20:17] <aaronmcadam> and using left : 0, top : 0 so they stack
[08:20:28] <aaronmcadam> now I want to find the height of a div's contents
[08:20:36] <aaronmcadam> $('#slide_up').contents().height() doesn't work
[08:21:29] <jeffsmykil> does anyone have anything regarding click/versus touch?
[08:21:53] <aaronmcadam> most of the time you can get away with a click on mobile
[08:22:19] <jeffsmykil> doesnt work on the ipad
[08:23:21] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[08:23:22] <jeffsmykil> some do
[08:23:24] <jeffsmykil> some dont
[08:25:27] <ccmonster> might depend on the element?
[08:25:54] <foldedcat> I'm using Jquery UI Accordion and I want it to collapse when I hover away from it
[08:26:10] <ccmonster> blur event?
[08:26:11] <jeffsmykil> i think my elements are too close together honestlu
[08:26:19] <ccmonster> that could be it jeffsmykil.
[08:26:34] <ccmonster> causing some sort of 'double tap'
[08:27:40] <ccmonster> jeffsmykil, i dont think you want to do a blur event collapse. That would get really crazy.
[08:28:02] <ccmonster> combined with mouseover expands, and blurs, the accordian would be potentially jumping all around and get confusing.
[08:31:23] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: the performance is rather lackluster :/
[08:31:45] <ccmonster> That's what I would have guessed.
[08:32:10] <jeffsmykil> that kind of sucks...
[08:32:15] * Industrialist wants to start a web site factory in Detroit.
[08:32:33] <Industrialist> I'm imagining there's this really long assembly line -- essentially a conveyor belt -- with programmers standing along it wearing hard hats and safety glasses.
[08:33:17] <aaronmcadam> crap
[08:33:18] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster wonder if its the animation qeue
[08:33:24] <aaronmcadam> i need the height of all children combined
[08:33:58] <aaronmcadam> but contents returns DOM elements
[08:35:10] <ccmonster> why do you need the height?
[08:37:02] <Industrialist> Laptops are coming down the line, each one is a web site. Programmers code furiously, mashing the keys hard, as the laptop moves from coder to coder
[08:38:32] <timing> Industrialist: what is that? Simultaneous Web-devving?

[08:43:44] <timing> shaun_: use the source luke :-)
[08:44:05] <timing> shaun_: he uses css position: absolute;
[08:44:19] <shaun_> yeah its some DHTML solution
[08:44:23] <timing> shaun_: pretty neat idea, those pages

[08:44:27] <timing> what is dhtml ?
[08:44:40] <shaun_> was just wondering if there was a query solution
[08:44:45] <timing> the stacked divs is nothing D, it's just html
[08:44:46] <shaun_> dynamic html ?
[08:44:51] <jedimind> hey, i have a noob question
[08:45:04] <jedimind> i have a html5 data attribute where im attempting to contain a json object i can reference within js
[08:45:21] <ZeBigDuck> Hello guys
[08:45:21] <jedimind> and i grab the data value etc just fine, but i cannot use it as a json object, what do i have to do to to the string to do so ?
[08:45:37] <ccmonster> Yea, its most likely just relative/absolute positioned divs that are staggered and stacked via z-index
[08:45:44] <ZeBigDuck> here is a small gift : https://gist.github.com/1235092 =)
[08:45:48] <shaun_> yeah
[08:45:58] <shaun_> dynamically or just hard coded?
[08:46:13] <ccmonster> could be either.
[08:46:46] <ccmonster> doing programmatically would probably be easier, just because if you change the content the site would still handle it accordingly
[08:47:03] <shaun_> yeah
[08:47:07] <ccmonster> the only thing I assume would be the catch is getting your order down.
[08:47:27] <ccmonster> each time someone triggers the draggable, that z-index needs to come to the front,
[08:47:40] <ccmonster> and everything else needs to remain stacked, behind it
[08:48:20] <shaun_> yeah
[08:48:22] <shaun_> shit
[08:48:26] <shaun_> sorry
[08:49:06] <shaun_> guess it doesn't have to be stacked like that
[08:49:23] <shaun_> cheers for the help
[08:49:42] <ccmonster> np. There code looks like A LOT
[08:50:01] <ccmonster> not sure if it's overkill or how much is uneeded in your situation, but likely the code could be MUCH MUCH smaller.
[08:50:18] <bEEEviz> short question: (function(foo) { })(this);
[08:50:34] <bEEEviz> is foo a reference to the window object or a copy?
[08:50:43] <ccmonster> log it out
[08:50:54] <ccmonster> console.log('foo',foo);
[08:52:19] <bEEEviz> looks like a reference
[08:52:34] <kpettit> I need to merge two objects using "  $.extend(obj1, obj2)"  Object two is json data, how can I merge that json data?
[08:53:51] <kpettit> I'm fairly new to this.  The json data looks good and my initial object looks good.  Just having a hard time trying to figure out how to merge the two
[08:54:18] <ccmonster> ?extend @ kpettit
[08:54:18] <bot-t> kpettit, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[08:54:25] <ccmonster> check the api
[08:54:47] <kpettit> ccmonster, that's what I've been using.  But it hasn't been working.
[08:55:09] <ccmonster> are you trying to merge obj2 into obj1?
[08:55:16] <kpettit> I tried doing jQuery.parseJSON(obj2) in case the data was ugly, but still didnt' work
[08:55:17] <ccmonster> or trying to create a new obj that is the result of the merger?
[08:55:37] <Exnor> is there a way to dynamically initialise a class in JS/jQuery?  i.e. var ferarri = new $car();
[08:55:42] <ccmonster> var newobj = $.extend(true,{},obj1,obj2);
[08:55:48] <ccmonster> then log out newobj
[08:55:55] <Exnor> $car being the var, obviously not valid syntax
[08:55:58] <kpettit> merge obj2 into obj1.   Obj 1 is a array of variables,  obj2 has some updates that will overwrite a few things in obj1 if I merge correctly
[08:55:59] <blackspotwiggins> i dont think you can extend true very much
[08:56:17] <blackspotwiggins> you cant merge object into an array
[08:56:20] <ccmonster> there is a part in the api that i believe discusses how to do that exactly Exnor
[08:56:58] <ccmonster> i think $.extend(obj1,obj2) merges 2 into 1, and overwrite anything in 1 with what is in 2
[08:57:06] <Exnor> ccmonster any idea where?
[08:57:09] <Exnor> ah
[08:57:12] <ccmonster> the true will do a deep copy
[08:57:18] <ccmonster> or deep merger*
[08:57:35] <Exnor> well im not looking to combine classes, just eval() basically
[08:57:49] <ccmonster> ?demo @ Exnor
[08:57:50] <bot-t> Exnor, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:58:06] <Exnor> $new would be a string that represents the name of a class
[08:58:12] <Exnor> $car even
[08:58:21] <kpettit> ccmonster.  That's what it did in my tests if I manually create obj1 and obj2.  But getting obj2 as JSON seems to mess me up with that.
[08:58:44] <ccmonster> ?demo @ kpettit
[08:58:45] <bot-t> kpettit, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:58:46] <kpettit> I haven't done alot of JSON, so I'm not sure if there is something else I need to do to convert the json data so I can merge it correctly.
[08:58:59] <kpettit> ccmonster, ok, will do.  Thanks.
[08:59:54] <ccmonster> np
[09:06:38] <Altreus> if I use the selector 'option[selected]', it returns an option, even if none actually has the attribute 'selected'; that is, it returns whichever one is currently active in the select, even if I have not explicity set it to have the attribute. Is this correct behaviour?
[09:06:46] <Altreus> If it is correct behaviour, how does it differ from :selected ?
[09:07:05] <jcrawford> hello everyone, I have a span button that when clicked executes a JQuery clicked event.  This method is supposed to change the value of a drop down and then execute an ajax request to update the page.  I am using $("#id").click(function() { $("#transactionCodes").val(0); }) <-- this seems to work in the fact that it makes the proper ajax request but the drop down is never visually changed to the proper value.  Am I missing something?
[09:07:55] <jcrawford> i am using the JqueryUI selectmenu plugin
[09:09:36] <ccmonster> ?demo @ jcrawford
[09:09:37] <bot-t> jcrawford, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:09:53] <jcrawford> will try now, one moment
[09:10:30] <jcrawford> kinda hard to do a working demo when there are so many components in play here :)
[09:12:24] <johnline3> had this issue that i've been putting off for a while, http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/design/ .. the galleria(s) on this page on chrome and firefox bug out when using the tabs and interacting with another galleria, i cant seem to get around the bug
[09:15:55] <jcrawford> ok so it seems to be an issue with the selectmenu plugin because when I remove that it works just fine
[09:16:09] <jcrawford> when I have it enabled and I click the reset button the value is nev er visually reflected
[09:16:27] <jcrawford> only found that out because I didn't have UI selected in jsfiddle.net
[09:23:09] <muzone> At my world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map (based on http://backspace.com/mapapp/javascript_world/)- why do most countries flash during hover, and remain black when the mouse is off?
[09:24:41] <muzone> Brodingo?
[09:27:22] <ccmonster> muzone, you aren't using the script right
[09:27:40] <ccmonster> you need more propertys in the attr piece
[09:31:39] <muzone> ccmonster: like what?
[09:31:50] <ccmonster> you didnt completely copy their code
[09:31:52] <mohadib> hello
[09:31:55] <ccmonster> hi
[09:31:56] <muzone> yes i did
[09:31:57] <muzone> check it
[09:32:08] <Xeon06_> Can anyone link me to somewhere listing the browser support for jquery ui?
[09:32:19] <muzone> the only other attribute http://backspace.com/mapapp/javascript_world/ uses is stroke, but i've disabled my strokes so i figured i didnt need them in the first place. even with the strokes, the result is the same..
[09:32:26] <mohadib> where can i get animated gifs for the jquery ui progress bar? so it looks animated
[09:33:07] <sgrover> Inside a blur event, how do I know what object got clicked to trigger the blur event?  I can't use e.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget due to an older version of jQ (1.3.2) that can't be updated in this project....
[09:33:20] <muzone> ccmonster: as soon as i changed the main fill to #ccc, the onmouseover fill to #000 and the onmouseout to #ccc, things became like this. when i revert those 3 changes my version functions exactly like the original (flawless)
[09:33:50] <ccmonster> change one thing at a time, see what happens
[09:33:51] <muzone> i tried to put up an example on jsfiddle for easier access but apparently it wouldnt work due to cross-site scripting or whatever
[09:34:01] <muzone> ok sure
[09:34:46] <smftre> how do I hook into the dialog close event?
[09:35:35] <smftre> Thought I could do $(".mydialog").dialog({close:function(ev,ui){alert("called");}}); but that doesnt seem to do the trick!  :S
[09:35:39] <ccmonster> its on the events under diag
[09:35:55] <ccmonster> $( ".selector" ).bind( "dialogclose", function(event, ui) {
[09:37:09] <smftre> ccmonster: thanks, will give it a go
[09:37:36] <smftre> ccmonster: and so it works, thanks very much :)
[09:37:45] <ccmonster> np
[09:38:32] <ccmonster> muzone, your mouseout color is wrong
[09:38:58] <muzone> ccmonster: http://home.no/dwaynie/map/index2.html theres the original basically right
[09:39:05] <johnline3> had this issue that i've been putting off for a while, http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/design/ .. the galleria(s) on this page on chrome and firefox bug out when using the tabs and interacting with another galleria, i cant seem to get around the bug
[09:40:10] <muzone> ccmonster: so now im gonna change fill: "#333" in var attr to #ccc" ok?
[09:40:32] <ccmonster> ok.
[09:40:38] <muzone> thanks
[09:40:39] <muzone> 2 sec
[09:41:25] <muzone> ccmonster: http://home.no/dwaynie/map/index2.html
[09:41:27] <muzone> weird
[09:41:37] <ccmonster> ok. so the default color needs to be changed
[09:41:46] <ccmonster> so whatever that mouseout is, you need to change it to your base color or w/e
[09:41:53] <mohadib> anyone have a progress bar gif to match smoothness theme?
[09:42:58] <ccmonster> change your mouseout fill to #ccc
[09:42:59] <muzone> ccmonster: At http://home.no/dwaynie/map both var attr fil and the mouseout fill are set to #ccc..
[09:43:48] <ccmonster> im still seeing  current && map[current].animate({fill: "#333", stroke: "#666"}, 300);
[09:43:52] <ccmonster> st.animate({fill: "#333", stroke: "#666"}, 300);
[09:44:06] <muzone> ccmonster: http://home.no/dwaynie/map/index.html ?
[09:44:18] <muzone> the original one i just put up was http://home.no/dwaynie/map/index2.html
[09:44:40] <muzone> i can do it to index2 too, 2 sec
[09:45:33] <ccmonster> you need a fill
[09:45:35] <ccmonster> and just make it ''
[09:45:39] <ccmonster> not none
[09:45:45] <ccmonster> and put it in the mouseover and mouseout
[09:46:01] <muzone> a stroke you mean?
[09:46:42] <muzone> ccmonster: http://home.no/dwaynie/map/index2.html still the same problem
[09:46:47] <ccmonster> you seem to be missing this line st.animate({fill: "#333", stroke: "#666"}, 300);
[09:46:55] <ccmonster> map[state].color = Raphael.getColor(); that line i mean
[09:47:23] <muzone> not in index2.html
[09:47:34] <muzone> i took it out in index.html because i didnt need random fancy colors
[09:48:07] <muzone> its still in index2.html and the problem is still there unfortunately
[09:48:58] <ccmonster> that's odd. if you hilight one place, then go to the next, the LAST mousedover spot goes black,
[09:49:05] <ccmonster> if you re-hilight the same place, it works correctly
[09:49:45] <muzone> hmm
[09:49:50] <ccmonster> change the body css to white
[09:49:52] <ccmonster> not black
[09:49:56] <ccmonster> curious bout something
[09:50:10] <Ziggy`> http://jsfiddle.net/fpNEA/ - I'm trying to figure out how I can manage this to go easily further and further down this tree, and be able to toggle show/hide elements under each ,,category" .. I'm thinking what is my best option here? To be able to show/hide what goes under each category clicked.
[09:50:28] <muzone> done ccmonster
[09:50:41] <Brodingo> hopefully no one points out that there is no jquery involved in any of this
[09:51:54] <muzone> no no no dont say..
[09:52:27] <ccmonster> ...?
[09:52:41] <muzone> nevermind, problem is still there ccmonster
[09:54:32] <muzone> ccmonster: do you notice anything
[09:54:59] <ccmonster> change your fill color from #000 to something else
[09:55:11] <ccmonster> on the mouseover
[09:55:29] <muzone> lets try 222
[09:55:46] <ccmonster> try something heinous so you can see where it happens
[09:55:58] <muzone> done, please refresh
[09:56:00] <muzone> hehe
[09:56:00] <antihero> Hey, can I make a localised dom and edit it? I want to replace an element with a generated select
[09:56:20] <ccmonster> and also do a console.log of current inside the function
[09:56:27] <ccmonster> not sure what you mean antihero
[09:56:29] <ccmonster> please explain
[09:57:09] <ccmonster> muzone, log out current and state
[09:57:17] <ccmonster> I am curious what's happening when those get set/used
[09:58:35] <muzone> ccmonster: working on it
[09:58:39] <muzone> ccmonster: never used console.log before
[10:02:02] <muzone> ccmonster: like this?
[10:02:10] <thansen> so I have some datepicker code that runs on .ready and grabs everything matching a particular class...how can I override the default settings 'inline' in code instead of putting some case statment in the initialization sequence?
[10:03:51] <ccmonster> is the pink color 222 ?
[10:04:06] <muzone> you wanted something heinous
[10:05:01] <ccmonster> it looks like its not referencing the last/current pages right
[10:05:09] <ccmonster> pages = countries, and then applying the colors
[10:05:28] <antihero> if I do preventDefault on $(form).submit(...)
[10:05:34] <antihero> how do I then have it submit after I've done my shit
[10:06:38] <muzone> ccmonster: is there a quick fix?
[10:06:39] <ccmonster> form.submit(e){e.preventDefault()
[10:06:42] <nFFF> Guys I'm using Ajax to load the next page and creating a new Ajax.Request(, -> transport.responseText -> which contains all the data of the new page looks like html, but I onyl need a certain aprt of thisd ata, any idea on here to parse this?
[10:06:54] <muzone> ccmonster: or a regular fix :D
[10:07:05] <ccmonster> ha
[10:07:20] <ccmonster> where is the green coming from ?
[10:07:40] <muzone> no idea actually..
[10:07:58] <muzone> probably map[state].color = Raphael.getColor();?
[10:09:00] <ccmonster> change your stroke to ccc
[10:09:30] <muzone> ccmonster: all of them?
[10:09:54] <atxq> how can I setInterval/setTimeout to different times?
[10:09:57] <ccmonster> well change it from none, for sure
[10:10:19] <muzone> ccmonster: please refresh
[10:10:25] <eddiemonge> atxq: after its called? or before?
[10:10:26] <Elephant> atxq: once you run setTimeout, afaik, if you want to change it, you have to cancel it, then start it oveer.
[10:11:15] <ccmonster> log out st.color inside mouseover, and then again in mouseout
[10:11:23] <atxq> so to change the setInterval time, I would have to cancel it first and then call it again with the new time?
[10:11:56] <Elephant> afaik, that is the case.
[10:12:08] <Elephant> so when you make your call, just be sure to put it in a var
[10:12:18] <Elephant> so you can clearTimeout(variable);
[10:12:20] <atxq> I had set a vaiable var t=5000 before the setInterval, and changing the t value inside setInterval, but did not work
[10:12:28] <ccmonster> also, muzone , log out current && map[current]
[10:12:35] <ccmonster> i think i see what's happening
[10:12:45] <muzone> ccmonster: 2 sek
[10:13:15] <Elephant> atxq: yeah, I think you need "var t=setTimeout('alert("lol");', 1000;clearTimeoute(t)"
[10:13:30] <Elephant> missing some ) action
[10:13:35] <Elephant> but that is the jist
[10:13:45] <muzone> ccmonster: current && map[current] in mouseover and mouseout?
[10:13:54] <ccmonster> yea
[10:13:56] <atxq> Elephant, let me try it here
[10:14:03] <ccmonster> i want to see whats going on there, but i think i know what you need to do
[10:14:36] <ccmonster> mouseover needs a fill of #ccc, and a stroke of whatever the default is
[10:14:38] <muzone> hey thats great news
[10:14:39] <Elephant> I just did this the other day actually :)
[10:14:39] <muzone> please refresh
[10:15:16] <muzone> ccmonster: refresh again please
[10:15:28] <muzone> mouseout had no stroke, sorry
[10:15:33] <muzone> added it now though
[10:15:58] <Elephant> brb
[10:15:59] <ccmonster> ok, remove the console .log
[10:16:18] <muzone> done!
[10:16:22] <ccmonster> change the mouseover fill to #ccc and stroke to whatever the default is
[10:16:52] <ccmonster> so i'd made the stroke #fff perhaps
[10:16:59] <ccmonster> so fill #ccc, stroke #fff
[10:17:18] <muzone> ccmonster: like this?
[10:17:29] <ccmonster> boom
[10:17:31] <ccmonster> like that
[10:17:44] <ccmonster> done
[10:18:17] <muzone> ccmonster: so there was no bug?
[10:18:24] <ccmonster> im not sure what was up
[10:18:28] <muzone> hehe
[10:18:45] <muzone> what if i need the strokes to be gone, and mouseover fills to be black?
[10:18:49] <ccmonster> change the stroke on those to #fff
[10:19:23] <ccmonster> then some variation of current && map[current].animate({fill: "#ccc", stroke: "#fff"}, 300); needs to be split up
[10:19:36] <muzone> done
[10:20:04] <ccmonster> the colors look good too, they help the user recognize regions
[10:20:47] <muzone> some variation needs to be split up what you mean?
[10:20:54] <muzone> cant have those colors im afraid.. my designer she'd kill me
[10:21:02] <muzone> with her eyes
[10:21:12] <ccmonster> haha
[10:21:40] <ccmonster> current && map[current].animate({fill: "#ccc", stroke: "#fff"}, 300); needs to be split up - that lines is basically setting both the current and the last to your base grey, then the next line is animating the current to the color
[10:22:01] <ccmonster> so actually, the next line could just be changed from st.color to #000 perhaps
[10:23:15] <ccmonster> you HAVE to have a stroke
[10:23:21] <muzone> like this ccmonster?
[10:23:23] <ccmonster> just make the stroke the same as the fill
[10:23:24] <muzone> yeah..
[10:23:37] <ccmonster> there you go.
[10:23:42] <ccmonster> dunzo
[10:23:46] <muzone> boom
[10:24:03] <ccmonster> boom goes the dynamite
[10:24:41] <muzone> seems to work well commenting // map[state].color = Raphael.getColor();
[10:24:53] <muzone> oh yeah we about to take over the world now man=)
[10:25:16] <firespeaker> if I want to attach a named function to inputs' blur events, is this one right way to do it?  $('input').blur(myfunction($(this)));
[10:25:39] <ccmonster> sure
[10:25:47] <muzone> ccmonster: you want me to hook you up with my designer? shes single
[10:25:54] <ccmonster> LOL
[10:25:56] <muzone> long black hair, wears glasses
[10:26:23] <ccmonster> I'm very taken
[10:26:49] <muzone> i havent seen her with her pants off - im taken too - but im guessing not far from http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/No_Photos765.htm
[10:26:54] <muzone> ah ok
[10:27:28] <ccmonster> lol, im at work, watch what you send lol
[10:27:37] <ccmonster> gotta throw the SFW, or NSFW on there
[10:27:51] <muzone> hehe whats that?
[10:27:55] <jrockjiggz> i don't think anyone could have a problem with that pic ;)
[10:27:56] <muzone> so fine woman / not so fine woman?
[10:28:27] <ccmonster> sfw/nfsw = safe for work, not safe for work
[10:28:36] <muzone> aah
[10:28:44] <muzone> never was good with acronyms
[10:29:33] <necromancer> i'm sure your designer will like that reference
[10:29:44] <necromancer> "hey i have this cute guy you should talk to. I MET HIM ON AN INTERNET CHATROOM"
[10:29:58] <danzik171> ccmonster: It's probably a safe assumption that any sentence beginning with "seen her with her pants off" and ending in a link is probably NSFW =P
[10:30:08] <ccmonster> this is true.
[10:30:09] <ccmonster> just saying
[10:30:31] <ccmonster> however, I wouldn't mind having that to roll out of bed to :)
[10:30:42] <firespeaker> ROFL
[10:31:19] <ccmonster> i wouldn't kick her out of bed.
[10:31:29] <ccmonster> that is, unless she wanted to get busy on the floor. :D
[10:31:50] <muzone> hhhhhhhhhh:)
[10:34:29] <Aristata> If I have an array of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] how do I reject items not divisible by 2?
[10:34:49] <Aristata> I need some kind of a reject function that only keeps items that eval to true
[10:35:12] <firespeaker> sounds like a loop :(  but maybe someone can think of something better
[10:35:24] <firespeaker> gg
[10:35:27] <ccmonster> um, just do a divisible, then return true, or false, and if(true), push it to your new array
[10:37:13] <ccmonster> var good;if(this % 2 === 0 ){ good.push(this)} ..
[10:37:14] <ccmonster> or something
[10:37:21] <ccmonster> then return good
[10:37:33] <ccmonster> and good should contain only what was what you wanted, and proceed with good
[10:39:50] <enapupe> ?ready
[10:39:51] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[10:41:57] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html - what's the right way of grouping countries into various regions and allowing the user to hover and select them instead? I tried with http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map2.html but I must be missing something.
[10:44:20] <danagin> I'm getting an object not found error for a script that is setup on my .js file. The object isn't always going to be there, so how to I suppress this error?
[10:46:30] <necromancer> don't reference it if it's not there?
[10:46:50] <necromancer> "object not found" means you are trying to reference an object that doesn't exist
[10:50:28] <ccmonster> muzone, not sure what you mean
[10:51:45] <muzone> ccmonster: well, many countries are too small for a user to select, so i figured id group them together into regions
[10:52:13] <muzone> belgium, netherlands and luxembourg together into the "benelux" region, norway, sweden, denmark and iceland into "scandinavia" etc.
[10:53:09] <muzone> ccmonster: world.js has every country identified with its two-letter countrycode, so i made an attempt with var regions = {};
[10:53:37] <muzone> ccmonster: and changed state to region, and st to rg, in that for loop
[10:54:26] <Ziggy`> I need to count spaces inside a string, before the word starts, e.g.: "  Hello" = 2, How can I go about doing this?
[10:55:44] <dabear> Ziggy`: how is that related to jquery? (  ##javascript would be better)
[10:55:51] <Ziggy`> Sorry, figured..
[10:55:52] <Ziggy`> Of course.
[10:56:07] <ccmonster> and, how'd that work muzone
[10:58:22] <dabear> muzone: trouble is, the definitition of scandinavia might be different from each person you ask. for example, I would not count icelandic as scandinavian
[10:59:51] <SEJeff_work> What is the best way to get a list of "keys" in a javascript object which looks like a python dictionary? I'm trying to take an object like this: devices = {"cr01a": {"output": "cr01a OUTPUT"}, "cr01b": {"output": "cr01b OUTPUT"}} and return an array containing ['cr01a', 'cr01b']
[10:59:59] <muzone> ccmonster: basically group multiple states together into regions, and instead of for (var state in map) { do for (var region in map) { instead?
[11:00:16] <ccmonster> well, how do you know what is included in what region?
[11:00:23] <SEJeff_work> I tried adding a small function to that specific variable ala device.__proto__.keys which iterates over this with a for loop, but that still prints the name of keys
[11:00:25] <Jason[Groupon]> question.  How do I run jquery in this : http://pastebin.com/0dMGatTH
[11:00:37] <Jason[Groupon]> when I try to, it doesn't recognize dom objects
[11:00:51] <muzone> dabear: yup, this is why it is very ideal for me to be able to organize this grouping nicely in js, as opposed to having to load up illustrator and group them together and merge and convert to raphaeljs etc.
[11:01:00] <Jason[Groupon]> when I wrap it with the jquery ready function, I get "activeNavigation is not a constructer"
[11:01:03] <Industrialist> So anyway, I'm starting a new business.
[11:01:07] <muzone> dabear: iceland is basically a norwegian state though
[11:01:15] <dabear> lol
[11:01:15] <dabear> no
[11:01:16] <Industrialist> It's a code factory. I'm imagining there's this really long assembly line -- essentially a conveyor belt -- with programmers standing along it wearing hard hats and safety glasses.
[11:01:23] <SmartTowel> you wouldn't have it in a function like that Jason
[11:01:25] <Industrialist> Coffee comes from above from tubes running along the ceiling of the factory.
[11:01:26] <ccmonster> it's 'owned' by the netherlands or something, right?
[11:01:36] <Industrialist> Laptops are coming down the line, each one is a web site. Programmers code furiously, mashing the keys hard, as the laptop moves from coder to coder
[11:01:43] <Industrialist> It will be in Detroit, so I'm sure I can make a deal with Bob King to get all the bought out UAW workers into our plant.
[11:01:43] <muzone> ccmonster: iceland is owned by the netherlands?
[11:01:49] <muzone> i dont think so
[11:01:52] <SmartTowel> @Jason, you would be doing all the same code but wrapped in the ready function OUTSIDE the PHP code.
[11:01:53] <ccmonster> denmark and norway have some govermental influence i think
[11:02:00] <SEJeff_work> Industrialist, Except instead of programmers, it will have code monkeys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYodWEKCuGg
[11:02:01] <muzone> yeah something like that
[11:02:06] <Jason[Groupon]> SmartTowel: this is javascript :p
[11:02:11] <muzone> iceland was populated by norwegians though
[11:02:24] <muzone> their language is old norwegian and their flag is the norwegian flag in inverted colors
[11:02:33] <SmartTowel> hmmm, so ur saying wrapping that in ready is giving you error?
[11:02:58] <Jason[Groupon]> indeed, I need to access items in the dom, and I would like to use jquery
[11:03:07] <Jason[Groupon]> but it doesn't seem to have an updated view of the dom
[11:03:34] <SmartTowel> also, lines 3-5, why not just write: this.getCurrentLocationÂ =Â document.location.href;
[11:03:45] <Jason[Groupon]> good call
[11:03:46] <erichynds> what exactly are you trying to access in the DOM
[11:03:54] <Industrialist> Any advice for hiring foremen to run my code factory's jquery assembly line unit?
[11:04:18] <muzone> dabear: for the same reason israel is allowed into the eurovision song contest
[11:04:27] <muzone> ccmonster: so you think it can be done?
[11:04:31] <Jason[Groupon]> erichynds I am going to need to write to divs, and I would prefer to use jquery
[11:04:38] <dabear> huh?
[11:04:41] <erichynds> so what's the question?
[11:04:44] <erichynds> how to use jquery?
[11:04:52] <dabear> iceland was under denmark for a long time, but is independant today
[11:04:56] <Jason[Groupon]> doing $(".whatever").html(stuff) doesn't render
[11:05:09] <Jason[Groupon]> it doesn't recognize that "whatever" is in the dom
[11:05:19] <muzone> oh indeed
[11:05:21] <Jason[Groupon]> trying to wrap this in a ready breaks the code
[11:05:22] <firespeaker> Jason[Groupon]: you've got an extra symbol in there
[11:05:38] <firespeaker> Jason[Groupon]: between the h and the a
[11:05:40] <muzone> dabear: are you from iceland?
[11:05:47] <dabear> I am from norway
[11:05:53] <muzone> if so i hope i didnt offend you by s.. oh
[11:05:59] <erichynds> Jason[Groupon]: $(function(){ $(".whatever").html(stuff); }); breaks?
[11:06:14] <Jason[Groupon]> erichynds: one sec, let me check
[11:06:16] <ccmonster> i didnt realize they only had 300K people in iceland.
[11:06:31] <ccmonster> DC is more populus than the whole coutnry. wild
[11:06:58] <muzone> hehe
[11:07:18] <SmartTowel> Jason, how are u calling activeNavigation in ur application?
[11:07:22] <muzone> yeah and despite that they got a pretty wild and unique culture
[11:07:27] <muzone> nightlife is crazy
[11:07:50] <ccmonster> I've heard they have quite the culture.
[11:07:50] <firespeaker> if I want to attach a random named function to e.g., inputs' blur events in jquery, is this one right way to do it?  $('input').blur(myfunction($(this)));   or do named/already-defined functions work differently?
[11:08:05] <ccmonster> I hear it's quite the pleasant place.
[11:08:24] <ccmonster> ironically, greenland is the hell hole, and iceland is the pleasant place
[11:08:31] <Jason[Groupon]> erichynds: nope
[11:08:35] <firespeaker> ccmonster: blame it on the Norse
[11:08:47] <ccmonster> Yea, they named it that way on purpose, so i've been told.
[11:08:48] <firespeaker> ccmonster: they wanted to advertise Greenland to potential settlers
[11:09:05] <ccmonster> haha, well Greenland isn't exactly very hospitable.
[11:09:09] <jedimind> is there a built-in jquery func that will give me a full .width() ? including all margins/paddings ?
[11:09:22] <domino14> i am trying to split up an enormous JS file that consits of $(document).ready (function() { â¦. } )    where the â¦ is 4 JQuery plugins defined one after the other (using the suggested notation where the jQuery object is passed into an anonymous function)
[11:09:37] <ngharo> firespeaker: you gotta wrap it.  I like using call() which passes on `this' to your func: $('input').blur(function() { myfunc.call(this); });
[11:09:41] <domino14> my question is why do the jquery plugins need to be defined inside the document.ready ? can i just put them in separate files? how do i 'call' them from document.ready?
[11:09:44] <muzone> ccmonster: i heard that too
[11:09:47] <Jason[Groupon]> SmartTowel:  http://pastebin.com/cmV3V7pk
[11:09:50] <firespeaker> ngharo: thanks!
[11:09:53] <muzone> ccmonster: supposedly everyone there are miserable alcoholics
[11:09:55] <ccmonster> there's only ~55K people there.
[11:10:01] <ccmonster> crazy.
[11:10:11] <muzone> ccmonster: heres a really cool film from iceland though, nice intro to the whole place http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFb-SL01iC0
[11:10:24] <Jason[Groupon]> missed a couple characters towards the end, but they are there :)
[11:10:24] <muzone> grab it off tpb if you fancy it
[11:12:08] <Jason[Groupon]> correction...
[11:12:21] <Jason[Groupon]> jquery works... as long as it is already in the dom... I think I can live with it :/
[11:12:27] <Jason[Groupon]> just use live for new stuff
[11:14:58] <firespeaker> ngharo: the variable being passed (elem, from var elem = $(this); ) is an Object before it gets passed to the function, but once in the function it's undefined.
[11:15:25] <firespeaker> ohhh, I can use it straight as "this" in the function.  sweet
[11:15:30] <domino14> do jquery plugins need to be defined in $(document).ready ?
[11:15:42] <ccmonster> apparently they banned hard liquor but allowed beer and wine and that did a lot to curb alcohol related problems.
[11:16:14] <ccmonster> or free sale of beer wine ( i gues sthat means tax free )
[11:18:19] <domino14> hello
[11:18:28] <muzone> ccmonster: greenland?
[11:18:42] <muzone> its kinda weird too, about greenland, those people look chinese
[11:19:00] <domino14> i have four plugins defined in $(document).ready  (by defined i mean they have the (function($){ â¦.}) (jQuery);  â there's four of them. how do i split them up? why do they need to be in $(document).ready ?
[11:19:17] <muzone> imagine they went all the way from africa, through to japan, alaska, across canada and into greenland
[11:19:27] <muzone> that is a LONG JOURNEY, damn
[11:20:53] <dabear> domino14: in your code there, I don't see any document.ready call
[11:21:21] <dabear> that code is just an immediately invoked function that accept $ as it's first parameter
[11:21:44] <ccmonster> they are inuit. Like many who are in northern canada, and alaska.
[11:21:51] <ccmonster> essentially, eskimo.
[11:22:06] <Endeson> hi
[11:22:09] <domino14> dabear â no, the code looks like   $(document).ready(function () { â¦.. } )   and the â¦. is 4 jQuery plugins one after the other
[11:22:10] <dabear> hola
[11:22:36] <ccmonster> http://www.sikunews.com/News/Denmark-Greenland/Here-she-is%3A-Miss-Inuit-2009%21-6891
[11:22:38] <dabear> domino14: maybe they depend on the document being ready then
[11:22:43] <ccmonster> thats a damn pretty inuit :)
[11:22:56] <domino14> but thats bad, i have four of them, and the file has like a million lines
[11:22:59] <domino14> how do i make it better
[11:23:14] <domino14> can i call multiple document.readys in different files?
[11:23:26] <ccmonster> yes domino14
[11:23:45] <Endeson> I'm using .error function to handle $.ajax Requests that failed. However, in case of fail the backend sends me a status code 500 with detailed error description as json encoded esponse body - it's possible to access this data?
[11:23:55] <Trisox> coldhead
[11:23:58] <dabear> domino14: you can
[11:25:27] <muzone> daamn ccmonster !!
[11:25:39] <muzone> she looks..  i dunno turkish or something :P
[11:25:44] <ccmonster> haha.
[11:25:56] <dabear> and she's a mom
[11:25:58] <ccmonster> naw, she looks native american (american indian / eskimo)
[11:26:07] <ccmonster> haha. iilf :O
[11:26:12] <ccmonster> miiilf*
[11:26:17] <muzone> and ive always had a weak spot for turkish women, especially after seeing ahu turkpence
[11:26:20] <ccmonster> miilf* only 2 i's, woops
[11:26:26] <muzone> ah yeah
[11:26:32] <muzone> kinda indian too, thats right
[11:26:33] <muzone> lol
[11:26:38] <muzone> i want me an inuit son
[11:27:06] <ccmonster> haha
[11:27:08] <domino14> this is adumb question, but how can i tell if the plugins need the document to be rady?
[11:27:11] <ccmonster> find one. They are rare haha
[11:27:31] <dabear> domino14: contact the author. or post your code in jsfiddle

[11:27:41] <muzone> first things first though, at http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map2.html - can somebody take a look at my syntax and tell me how I'm doing grouping the various countries into regions? http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html for the working version.
[11:27:46] <muzone> ccmonster: not in greenland :D
[11:28:00] <mbtez> how do i use jquery to do a cross-browser compatible resize of a div ?
[11:28:00] <muzone> they must be dying for some tourism over there
[11:28:01] <muzone> lol
[11:28:45] <mbtez> is that even possible
[11:29:05] <muzone> ccmonster: !!!
[11:29:11] <muzone> ccmonster: miss inuit is on facebook! http://www.facebook.com/paarma
[11:29:23] <muzone> *add add add add add* :P
[11:31:23] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/ would anyone be interested in me turning that into a real plugin ?
[11:34:27] <ccmonster> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=34268483755&set=a.34262893755.42969.549878755&type=1
[11:34:42] <jedimind> ... ok?
[11:35:02] <ccmonster> jedimind, we alreayd have some very powerful, good, validator plugins
[11:36:00] <jedimind> yeah but they're largely bloated
[11:36:36] <muzone> ccmonster: beautiful
[11:38:50] <muzone> ccmonster: she only half inuit though
[11:39:02] <ccmonster> boo, weak
[11:42:35] <muzone> lol
[11:42:42] <muzone> hahaha
[11:43:37] <domino14> i dont understand how the jquery plugin include would require the code to be ready. Doesnt the plugin just 'register' a bunch of functions but not actually call them until it is needed by the rest of the code later?
[11:43:51] <domino14> i meant to say why would the jquery plugin require the document to be ready
[11:45:16] <ccmonster> the jquery plugin does not, the code you are trying to execute that uses the jquery library runs once the document is ready, meaning the document, all the scripts attached to .html file, images etc, have been loaded and are in the dom
[11:46:00] <ccmonster> but you cannot assure the jquery framework is loaded unless the document is ready, and therefor couldn't expect to execute and js that needed the jquery lib as a result.
[11:46:23] <ccmonster> which = fail
[11:46:27] <kanzie> Im trying to figure out a good build-process for a fairly big js-application. Is JsDoc the main tool for documentation generation?
[11:46:46] <ccmonster> no clue, haven't done any doc generation

[11:47:07] <ccmonster> oops, no dice
[11:47:12] <gooddesignusa> Is it possible for one page to run a javascript function on another page ( same domain ). I know if javascript opens the window you can do parent.functionname
[11:47:17] * muzone is having fun hovering at http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html
[11:47:23] <muzone> i feel like doing some backpacking
[11:47:39] <ccmonster> to greenland? or iceland?
[11:47:47] <domino14> ccmonster: so - jquery plugin code would look like (function($) { â¦ } ) (jQuery);   â then what you are saying is that this block would always need to be wrapped in $(document).ready  because else this 'jQuery' object that is being passed to this plugin code function would not be guaranteed to be something that is defined?
[11:48:11] <muzone> ccmonster: iceland first
[11:48:24] <muzone> they got inuits too though
[11:48:29] <ccmonster> gooddesignusa, not sure. just load that .js script that the function you want is in.
[11:49:00] <ccmonster> and then there's the whole bit about cross-domain restrictions
[11:49:05] <gooddesignusa> well i simplified my question so i wouldn't have to go into detail about what i'm doing
[11:49:11] <ccmonster> and 5/6x the people :)
[11:49:53] <gooddesignusa> its on the same domain. its b/c of the damn ipad not being able to upload files. i need to use this dumb app and it posts to a window. i'm trying to get that new window to run a function and pass the file name / location so i can fill it in a textarea to attach the file
[11:49:58] <muzone> ccmonster: one last thing though, at http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html when you hover quickly in between two counties you can get a slight glimpse of their borders - any way to prevent that?
[11:50:44] <muzone> apart from disabling that fading
[11:50:53] <ciss> hi, what is the minimum version of jquery required by jstree?
[11:52:08] <enjoycrf> hai
[11:52:13] <enjoycrf> !
[11:52:27] <Whirl3d> Good day all. If you bind the keypress event to an input field and in the kepress handler you unbind keypress, shouldn't it only fire the handler for the first keypress?
[11:52:52] <enjoycrf> how come the ajax complete doesnt run if i try to reload the page
[11:53:03] <enjoycrf> and have an ajax run on unload
[11:53:17] <muzone> np ill fix it later
[11:53:26] * muzone goes back to hovering for fun
[11:53:27] <domino14> just help m e understand something for a sec
[11:53:34] <muzone> this shit is hypotizing
[11:54:23] <muzone> like bubblewraps
[11:54:32] <daninma> I'm trying to ignore checkboxes on a specific form when using .serialize() but it keep ssubmitting them anyways. any clue what I'm doing wrong here? : $('#form1 input:not(":checkbox,.ignore")').serialize()
[11:54:49] <ccmonster> what is ?
[11:55:07] <ccmonster> and you could probably do some callbacks with your animation to make sure things fire forrectly.
[11:55:39] <daninma> i also tried $('#form1 input:not("[type=checkbox],.ignore")').serialize()
[11:56:46] <daninma> any thoughts on this one?
[11:56:48] <muzone> ccmonster: wait i fixed it
[11:56:52] <ccmonster> ok
[11:57:13] <muzone> just added a black stroke to the st.animate as well
[11:57:40] <ciss> 1.4, as it seems: http://jsfiddle.net/JfR5g/1/
[11:57:41] <ccmonster> sounds good.
[11:58:00] <muzone> yup
[11:58:05] <muzone> i owe you one ccmonster
[11:58:08] <muzone> http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html
[11:58:08] <ccmonster> have you figured out how to have regions?
[11:58:14] <muzone> this baby is damn near perfect now
[11:58:46] <muzone> im getting close, http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map2.html, i got like var region = {}; region.no = "Scandinavia"; region.se = "Scandinavia"; now
[11:59:23] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/u3nAr/
[11:59:40] <ccmonster> how do you know the region?
[11:59:49] <ccmonster> just put it in the world.js perhaps
[12:00:10] <daninma> is thsi a hard questions perhaps?
[12:00:38] <ccmonster> no.
[12:00:39] <Whirl3d> daninma, try the other form of not...$("#form1 input").not(":checkbox, .ignore").serialize()
[12:01:05] <ccmonster> bingo
[12:01:17] <ccmonster> was typing that out , saved me some trouble
[12:01:19] <daninma> hrmpf. tried that too, maybe ive got a syntax problem I'm not seeing
[12:02:00] <ccmonster> got a demo danima?
[12:02:03] <muzone> ccmonster: ill define the regions myself in the js im thinking
[12:02:10] <muzone> a friend of mine gave me this info
[12:02:11] <ccmonster> why?
[12:02:22] <muzone> because i want custom regions
[12:02:37] <daninma> no i didnt make a mockup yet. just needed to make sure i was using the correct selectors at least.
[12:02:39] <jedimind> question, if i have $('form').submit({ ... }); can i then submit the form from within there? or will it go into a loop
[12:02:44] <jedimind> because that's the submit event
[12:02:50] <ccmonster> well, unless you do a region and do something like, africa = [KE,EY,......]
[12:02:52] <ccmonster> then do a find later
[12:03:03] <ccmonster> when they click the country, and look through your region piece
[12:03:10] <ccmonster> which isn't a bad idea
[12:03:56] <muzone> ccmonster: cool
[12:04:01] <ccmonster> what was your thinking muzone ? what was your approach going to be ?
[12:04:03] <muzone> ccmonster: another friend of mine suggested this:
[12:04:06] <muzone> <Beoran> for (var region in map) should obvously be for(var country in map)
[12:04:06] <muzone> <Beoran> then , based on region[] look up the name of the region
[12:04:06] <muzone> <Beoran> you'll also need the inverse of the region table
[12:04:06] <muzone> <Beoran> to look up which countries are in what region.
[12:04:08] <muzone> <Beoran> the idea is like this -> onclick on every country - look up country -> look up countries for that region -> color/animate/whatever all these countries
[12:04:23] <Elephant> jedimind: afaik, it will continue with the submit if your action/method is set, just fire the JS specified before.
[12:04:29] <Whirl3d> jedimind, you can't call the submit function from within it's callback without a loop but you could $.post() or $.get() your results inside the submit handler without looping
[12:04:44] <ccmonster> basically muzone
[12:04:45] <jedimind> yeah, i was hoping to just submit it without resorting to an ajax submit with response etc
[12:04:54] <muzone> ccmonster: seem fair or?
[12:05:28] <jedimind> so if i have $('form').submit({ this.submit() }); it will basically loop ?
[12:05:35] <Whirl3d> jedimind, you could unbind submit within the submit handler or rebind it to another handler from within the first handler.
[12:05:36] <jedimind> $(this) obv but you get what i mean
[12:05:45] <ccmonster> Yea.
[12:06:01] <jedimind> hrm that's a possible option, unbind, then submit
[12:06:05] <StanlySoManly> i'm trying to get the contents of an iframe (on the same domain) and put them into a div on the page. here's my pastebin (didn't think this would work too well in jsfiddle) :  http://pastebin.com/qjYEib5K  it works in firefox, but not ie. ie complains about something actually in the jquery code. i'm using 1.5.1 currently. since this works in firefox, am i just doing something silly in my jq that i shouldn't be?
[12:06:17] <Whirl3d> What if you said, var secondSubmit=function () { your actual submit handler] and then $("something").submit(function () {
[12:06:53] <Whirl3d> $(this).unbind("submit").each(secondSubmit);
[12:07:11] <ccmonster> basically a json obj, that is key(region): value(array of 2 letter country codes) and do a lookup, retrieve the key:value pair if you match it, then store the region and do a value (all the matching countries).hilight
[12:08:09] <jedimind> cant ijust $(this).unbind('submit').submit(); ?
[12:09:04] <Whirl3d> when you say $("something").submit() it's the same as $("something").bind('submit',function)...so you would lose your original submit handler.
[12:09:28] <ccmonster> does that make sense muzone
[12:09:49] <Whirl3d> by assigning a variable name to your original handler, you can then unbind and rebind to your original handler.
[12:10:47] <Whirl3d> Same is true with a button....$("button").click(function () {$(this).unbind("click").click();}) wouldn't do anything
[12:11:42] <enjoycrf> can some one tell me
[12:12:34] <enjoycrf> whirled there are other ways to do that
[12:12:42] <jedimind> Whirl3d, i dont care about losing the binding at this point because im submitting and the page is refreshing anyway
[12:13:05] <jedimind> but $(this).unbind('submit').submit(); worked just fine
[12:13:16] <Whirl3d> I'll be the first to admit that I am not the best with forms.
[12:13:21] <jedimind> because .submit() is i guess a self contained function, and not so much a binded event
[12:13:29] <enjoycrf> wat he trying to do?
[12:13:33] <Whirl3d> That would make sense.
[12:13:51] <Whirl3d> So you had submit defined inline on your submit button or something?
[12:14:23] <jedimind> nope, it's just the global submit funcion for any form, i ... here one sec
[12:14:32] <orolo> i'm trying to abort() an xhr request made via $.ajax.
[12:14:39] <orolo> heres the pattern i'm trying: http://jsfiddle.net/BXHDp/
[12:14:51] <orolo> the return still returns even when i've hit the esc key.
[12:15:01] <ccmonster> i lose ya muzone
[12:15:18] <ccmonster> ?
[12:15:31] <jedimind> hrm it seems to hang firefox
[12:15:33] <jedimind> bastard
[12:15:33] <jedimind> lol
[12:15:41] <mbroadst> hi I'm trying to make use of my frameworks form validation (web2py in this case), however I'm trying to have the form submission all occur in an ajax-loaded div. as a result, when the server side validation succeeds, and wants to redirect to another page it doesn't seem to work with the jQuery ajax call I'm using
[12:16:14] <jedimind> but works fine in chrome
[12:16:18] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/
[12:16:43] <mbroadst> I've overloaded the form's submit method to post the data (with form.serialize as the data), and the callback method success has a variable (data) returned, which is not the redirected page
[12:16:49] <mbroadst> is there any way to do this? or is it too convoluted
[12:17:38] <jedimind> Whirl3d, problem is i dont know how to define my own event because i dont know how to submit the form as a standard form submit
[12:17:52] <jedimind> though i guess i could just return true and let it submit anyway
[12:17:54] <jedimind> duh
[12:18:44] <muzone> ccmonster: back, had to tend to the doggie
[12:19:16] <ccmonster> got ya.
[12:19:23] <ccmonster> so you want to do a $.inArray() i believe
[12:19:30] <muzone> ccmonster: that makes a little bit of sense yeah
[12:19:32] <ccmonster> and do a find on the 2 letter coutnry code inside the regions array
[12:19:37] <ccmonster> or, a regions jsonobj
[12:20:12] <johnline> you can almost spell that word backwards and it'd be the same
[12:20:20] <jedimind> Whirl3d, my own stupidity got in my way, i just let the form submit by returning true and that's that
[12:20:21] <jedimind> duh
[12:20:44] <Whirl3d> Looks good, too.
[12:20:52] <Whirl3d> Nice contact form, jedimind
[12:21:27] <jedimind> thx, i like making pretty [functional] things :)
[12:22:32] <muzone> ccmonster: you wouldnt happen to be itching to show everybody how it's done?
[12:22:39] <ccmonster> haha.
[12:22:46] <ccmonster> prob using a map or grep function perhaps
[12:23:22] <Whirl3d> I have a field that when it's blank, a button should be disabled. As soon as a single character is entered, the button should be enabled. Keypress is capturing the event before it adds the value to the input. Any suggestions?  http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/u3nAr/
[12:24:48] <Wizywig> so, any of u guys know, is jq ui just a deprecated bastard child of jquery?
[12:25:45] <orolo> Wizywig: my understanding is that jQuery is a best practices for all browsers of javascript.
[12:26:26] <orolo> *for javascript; not 'of'
[12:26:30] <jedimind> jquery UI is an addon to jquery (current and supported fully w/ latest version) that gives you some user interface stuff thats helpful
[12:26:40] <ccmonster> muzone, you need a recursize json search i think
[12:26:44] <orolo> oh, didn't see the UI, sorry.
[12:26:55] <nF{> Guys using Ajax, how do I prase .responseText() to insert certain div id's back into the page
[12:26:58] <nF{> eval()?
[12:27:14] <muzone> hmm
[12:27:29] <orolo> Wizywig: i think jqueryUI's widget factory is a lightweight framework pattern for javascript.
[12:27:41] <jedimind> $('.hiddendiv').html(response).find('#customid').appendTo('#response');
[12:27:43] <jedimind> something like that
[12:28:04] <jedimind> but there could be better ways to do that
[12:28:06] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(data:'html', url:someurl, success:function (data) {$(someDiv).html($(data));});
[12:28:08] <LoG1c\0x\> preloading 10 images in a div using a progress bar, and make them visible after it loads , how?
[12:28:25] <LoG1c\0x\> I didnt like what I did
[12:28:46] <jedimind> Whirl3d, i think he's looking for a specific element within 'data'
[12:28:54] <jedimind> but that could just be my interpretation of the question
[12:29:33] <Whirl3d> Oh, in that case, I almost always use .load or if I have to use .ajax, I put the contents in an invisible div and pull out the pieces I want that way.
[12:30:05] <jedimind> yeah thats what i suggested, dump it into something invisible, find what you're looking for and then move it out of there
[12:30:06] <muzone> ccmonster: i think im on to something 2 sec
[12:30:11] <nF{> Basically I need to update a div with id catalogfilters_layer
[12:30:15] <nF{> $('catalogfilters_layer').update(resp.layer);
[12:30:23] <nF{> thats whatIm using right now but it's not quite working
[12:30:35] <nF{> ormore
[12:30:36] <nF{>  resp = eval('(' + transport.responseText + ')');
[12:30:37] <Whirl3d> LoG1c\0x\, do you want to display them after they all load? or after each loads?
[12:30:42] <nF{> $('catalogfilters_layer').update(resp.layer);
[12:30:47] <nF{> these two lines
[12:31:34] <Whirl3d> ? update
[12:31:35] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .html() - Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:33:44] <muzone> ccmonster: https://gist.github.com/1235781 still working on it though
[12:33:50] <gnarf> wtf is .update() nF{
[12:34:16] <nF{> prototype framework
[12:34:17] <gnarf> also, $("#catalogfilters_layer")
[12:34:28] <nF{> http://pastebin.com/mVcPjbJn
[12:34:29] <gnarf> are you using jQuery or prototype?
[12:34:32] <nF{> here's the function
[12:34:53] <Wizywig_> so what i was saying about jq-ui is that it seems more of a framework for making widgets and such, not an end-point as many behaviors are left unimplemented intentionally. I can't seem to find a good set of extensions to it either, almost a tumbleweed community... maybe im majorly wrong
[12:35:28] <nF{> Im willing to re-write it in jQuery
[12:35:45] <ngharo> did you seriously expect prototype support in #jquery ?
[12:36:13] <ajpiano> Wizywig_: yr in the right place though, there's a bunch of people who develop jquery ui in this very channel
[12:36:21] <ajpiano> and someone else who is planning an extension lib
[12:36:23] <ajpiano> etc.
[12:36:40] <nF{> ngharo, it's my first time with javascript et al today
[12:36:43] <nF{> so bare with me
[12:37:39] <necromancer> Wizywig_: it's great to play around with but in a professional setting there aren't too many widgets that are useful without tons of customization
[12:38:15] <ajpiano> the whole *idea* is that it's customizable
[12:38:18] * necromancer is personally fond of twitter's bootstrap.js: twitter.github.com/bootstrap
[12:38:24] <Whirl3d> can someone tell me the ascii code range of visible characters?
[12:38:30] <ajpiano> i don't know of a lot of plugins that you can just magically drop into a project and boom, app.
[12:38:55] <necromancer> Whirl3d: google can
[12:39:04] <Whirl3d> I've been looking.
[12:39:08] <Whirl3d> seriously
[12:39:16] <necromancer> ajpiano: a lot of the time, it's faster for me to write a completely custom bit of code than to use jQuery UI
[12:39:28] <necromancer> Whirl3d: you searched for "ascii character table"?
[12:39:49] <ajpiano> congrats!
[12:40:05] <Whirl3d> http://www.laughtergenealogy.com/bin/header/ascii.html
[12:40:07] <Whirl3d> wtf?
[12:40:13] <necromancer> well i'd rather use jQuery UI! :)
[12:40:16] <nF{> ngharo, is prototype a good/bad framkework to use?
[12:40:29] <necromancer> nF{: depends on if you like debugging or not ;)
[12:41:03] <necromancer> ajpiano: it's more about the simplicity of the design and UI than the actual look & feel of jQuery UI. i know it's all styled
[12:41:56] <nF{> can I mix query and prototype?
[12:42:02] <necromancer> nF{: i never liked prototype because it didn't quite embrace what browser JS is good at
[12:42:11] <enjoycrf> nf yes
[12:42:11] <necromancer> (rather, all JS)
[12:42:13] <enjoycrf> ive done it
[12:42:28] <enjoycrf> just noconflict jquery to $j
[12:42:29] <necromancer> yeah you can but why do you want to, nF{? everything you can do in jQuery is possible in prototype as well
[12:42:42] <muzone> ccmonster: am i moving in the right direction?
[12:42:57] <ccmonster> sorda yea.
[12:43:02] <enjoycrf> ajpiano
[12:43:04] <enjoycrf> !!!
[12:43:07] <muzone> been looking for examples of recursive json searches but
[12:43:14] <ricardo_bb|home> anyone have an idea how to condense/improve this: http://pastebin.com/sUcaugDf
[12:43:14] <muzone> kinda hard since its my first time
[12:43:46] <enjoycrf> why does the ajax event complete code not runing when i run the ajax even on unload
[12:43:50] <gnarf> necromancer: I think that autocomplete has saved me from writing loads of code alone
[12:43:57] <gnarf> necromancer: position utility, another load of code
[12:44:06] <muzone> ccmonster: where do i go from here?
[12:44:16] <Nachtwind> I have a $.ajax({ ... } call that works as supposed. Yet i wnated to start returning messages based on the PHP file and i always end up in the "error:" part of the ajax file.. what triggers it to go there and not to success?
[12:44:21] <gnarf> then theres shit like dialog - which well, makes things too easy
[12:44:50] <gnarf> Nachtwind: error code responses, invalid json
[12:45:05] <Nachtwind> invalid json as in what the website prints?
[12:45:17] <gnarf> Nachtwind: if its a json ajax request
[12:45:18] <gnarf> yes
[12:45:33] <Nachtwind> hm, sounds good..
[12:45:50] <hlveheart> Anybody have a better solution for mobile OS detection than the jQuery.client plugin?
[12:45:51] <gnarf> if your output doesn't pass http://jsonlint.com it wont pass successfully in jQ either
[12:46:18] <gnarf> hlveheart: what kinda of mobiles?
[12:46:27] <hlveheart> namely iOS, and Android
[12:46:32] <necromancer> gnarf: i absolutely *love* Draggable, Droppable, etc.
[12:46:34] <gnarf> "orientation" in window ?
[12:46:42] <hlveheart> but iOS being split into two (iphone, and ipad)
[12:46:43] <necromancer> gnarf: but the only actual component i use regularly is datepicker
[12:46:48] <necromancer> tokenInput > autocomplete imo
[12:47:05] <hlveheart> jquery client has ipad and iphone detection combined, so that doesn't work for me
[12:47:23] <ricardo_bb|home> is there an jquery pro in here?
[12:47:33] * hlveheart blinks
[12:47:36] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: nope, just a bunch of newbies around here
[12:47:38] <hlveheart> is that a serious question?
[12:47:39] <hlveheart> ;o
[12:48:34] <ccmonster> muzone, im doing something here,should get you most of the way
[12:48:57] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: seriously? just need a bit of help with this bit: http://pastebin.com/sUcaugDf
[12:49:17] <ricardo_bb|home> it works but it could be cleaned up a bit
[12:49:24] <hlveheart> ricardo_bb|home, I wouldn't blame anybody if they didn't want to help you.
[12:49:34] <hlveheart> :S
[12:49:59] <hlveheart> you started off all condescending-like. and that's a no-go with programmers. lol.
[12:51:19] <gnarf> ?ask @ricardo_bb|home
[12:51:20] <bot-t> ricardo_bb|home, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:51:24] <ricardo_bb|home> the thing is, I have no idea, and I thought I could to find someone with experience in here to help a bit
[12:51:28] <gnarf> hard to help you if you don't tell us whats wrong
[12:51:40] <hlveheart> Sigh
[12:52:02] <Nachtwind> alright.. my ajax function looks like: http://pastebin.com/k5xefdUd and i echo  json_encode(array("result"=>"ok", "chain"=>$cid)); from my file... what the hell is bringing me to the ERROR section? the code runs fine
[12:52:04] <hlveheart> Less Ricardo, more gnarf.
[12:52:11] <hlveheart> == win.
[12:52:28] <ricardo_bb|home> troll
[12:52:31] <gnarf> Nachtwind: whats the response look like in firebug/chrome inspector?
[12:52:33] <ricardo_bb|home> more
[12:52:41] <Nachtwind> dont have firebug installed
[12:52:48] <gnarf> Nachtwind: then i'm not helping
[12:52:52] <Elephant> lol
[12:52:55] <gnarf> Nachtwind: try chrome, its builtin
[12:52:57] <Elephant> firebug is marvelous!
[12:53:10] <gnarf> no addon, just open the inspector
[12:53:16] <gnarf> look at the network tab
[12:53:20] <gnarf> and inspect the response
[12:53:20] <Elephant> you're doing ajax dev blind without it imho.
[12:53:25] <gnarf> is it what you expect?
[12:53:37] <gnarf> or is there some random <html> code i there
[12:53:40] <Nachtwind> hm
[12:53:48] <ricardo_bb|home> g(narf)
[12:53:50] <Whirl3d> how do I disable a button when input is blank, but enable it if input is not blank--as keys are pressed?
[12:53:50] <Nachtwind> ok, should install firebug
[12:54:02] <muzone> ccmonster: very excited
[12:54:20] <hlveheart> ricardo_bb|home, hardly a troll man. We can't help you help yourself. Read the topic and just ask your friggen question.
[12:54:23] <hlveheart> :|
[12:54:30] <ajpiano> he asked his question
[12:54:36] <Elephant> Whirl3d: have a function check the input strlen every time it changes.
[12:54:37] <ajpiano> it was "can anyone give me advice on how to clean up this code"
[12:54:44] <Elephant> Whirl3d: and then disable/enable accordingly.
[12:54:44] * hlveheart sighs
[12:54:48] <gnarf> it was?
[12:54:54] <gnarf> you just want a vaccum?
[12:54:56] <hlveheart> after he asked if anyone was smart enough to help him.
[12:55:00] <Elephant> get a dyson
[12:55:04] <Elephant> they're on woot today
[12:55:06] <gnarf> stop calling $() all over the place and cache your results....
[12:55:09] <Elephant> for cheap.
[12:55:12] <hlveheart> No way. Dyson's aren't durable!
[12:55:21] <Elephant> but woot rules
[12:55:23] <Whirl3d> Elephant, thanks for the input. Unfortunately, the change event only happens on blur, not on keypress. and keypress happens before the value of the input is affected
[12:55:49] <gnarf> Whirl3d: keyup?
[12:56:03] <Whirl3d> I'll try it. thanks.
[12:56:19] <gnarf> Whirl3d: var button = $("button"), input = $("input"); input.bind( "keyup", function( e ) { button.prop( "disabled", input.val().length > 0 ); }); ?
[12:56:33] <Elephant> so purdy
[12:56:43] <muzone> ccmonster: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57cxOMgMnP4 crazy movie about inuit bitches
[12:56:53] <hlveheart> inuit?
[12:57:03] <muzone> the ending will leave you hanging for days
[12:57:12] <muzone> hlveheart: is my spelling wrong
[12:57:19] <hlveheart> I don't know what the word means
[12:57:20] <hlveheart> lol
[12:57:22] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: $( this ) is called 3 times in the same function
[12:57:24] <gnarf> useless
[12:57:35] <hlveheart> Ah, arctic regions of canada
[12:57:35] <hlveheart> o.o
[12:57:55] <gnarf> also, you can clean up with a chain var elem = $( this ); elem.prepend(...).css(....).click();
[12:58:02] <Nachtwind> ok, might go a bit too deep now.. but may someone tell me how i can observe the stuff being send arround with firebug?
[12:58:09] <gnarf> also
[12:58:16] <gnarf> instead of creating imgs with ids
[12:58:25] <Elephant> Nachtwind: use the network tab for watching get/post, and the console for JS issues.
[12:58:40] <Elephant> you can see all the get/post action, with headers and responses.
[12:58:42] <gnarf> you can just var heading = $(this), img = $("<img....>"); then reference "img" later instead of $("#colimg"+i)
[12:58:42] <Whirl3d> gnarf, thanks...that was really stupid of me. Don't know why I didn't try that first. thanks.
[12:58:45] <hlveheart> indi movie trailers always seem to piss me off.
[12:58:53] <Elephant> albeit, it will refetch the response.
[12:58:53] <Nachtwind> oki, thanks
[12:58:57] <Elephant> :>
[12:59:02] <hlveheart> that fucking upbeat classical music in the background, in ALL OF THEM.
[12:59:07] * hlveheart slams head repeatidly
[12:59:26] <gnarf> ajpiano: thanks for pointing out that i missed one of his messages where he was saying "help clean up"
[12:59:40] <gnarf> also
[12:59:45] <gnarf> why do you need an array to store collapse?
[12:59:51] <Nachtwind> ok.. it returns {"result":"ok","chain":"33"} and afterwards the whole code of my page.. is that so?
[12:59:55] <gnarf> you're in a closure, var collapsed = false;
[13:00:09] <gnarf> unless you want to be able to see which is collapsed outside of that closure, there is no reason
[13:00:16] <hlveheart> it was pretty easy to miss, between him crying and stupid question asking.
[13:00:31] <Elephant> Nachtwind: well, if you're expecting just the JSON data, can you pop a lil exit() action right after it?
[13:00:39] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: any of that help you clean up?
[13:00:44] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: that's the thing, just reading the examples and out of this I try to figure out what to do
[13:00:50] <Elephant> inside whatever if/switch/for action you have going on specifically for that ajax request.
[13:01:00] <ricardo_bb|home> thank you very much
[13:01:05] <Nachtwind> hm, will try
[13:01:26] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: no prob - didn't realize you were asking for a general review/cleanup - just missed your line, sorry for pushing ?ask down your throat
[13:01:46] <Elephant> I don't really know best practices, but I usually like to have my pages, and then a "backend.php" that handles all the ajax calls.
[13:01:57] <hlveheart> but pushing ?ask is sometimes just a good reminder to prevent stupid questions.
[13:01:58] <Elephant> usually just a huge switch{case} block
[13:02:03] * hlveheart high fives ?ask
[13:03:22] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: trying to start with jquery, haven't done anything with javscript jet, just some c
[13:03:25] <hlveheart> Does navigator.userAgent.match(/Term/)/i) look for EXACT matches? Or does it check the entire useragent for said term?
[13:03:25] <Nachtwind> oh, wonderful - it works :0)
[13:03:30] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: lets see
[13:03:35] <Nachtwind> thanks people
[13:03:42] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: so, inside of a function - var's are scoped
[13:04:02] <gnarf> so for each call to the function gets its own copy of that var
[13:04:09] <Whirl3d> aha, what about auto-fill contents? When the contents of a field are auto-filled, the keyup event doesn't fire and my button is disabled still.
[13:05:39] <hlveheart> ^^?
[13:06:21] <manizzle> could someone take a look at this script for me?
[13:06:24] <sphinxxx> with the jquery ui datepicker, how can I do this custom format "Monday, August 29"
[13:06:56] <manizzle> im not sure i am sending the POST request properly with the jquery form module, as i am getting a error on my console
[13:07:03] <hlveheart> Is this the BEST way to detect mobile browsers?
[13:07:03] <hlveheart> http://jsbin.com/amolaz/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:08:27] <sphinxxx> its good h1veheart yeah
[13:08:39] <sphinxxx> on non html5 browser it'll rely on screen width
[13:08:56] <hlveheart> do new androids support HTML5?
[13:09:12] <Woet> define android
[13:09:16] <gnarf> also ricardo_bb|home
[13:09:17] <Woet> seeing there are 837498349839834 versions of it
[13:09:20] <hlveheart> I heard some android versions worked with screen width, and some didn't.
[13:09:21] <hlveheart> lol
[13:09:27] <gnarf> regarding the collapsed boolean you have there
[13:10:02] <gnarf> you might / should be able to just bind two events with .toggle( function, function )
[13:10:04] <gnarf> ?toggle
[13:10:05] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[13:10:08] <ccmonster> hey muzone , i have a meeting. I will have to get back to you on this.
[13:10:19] <muzone> sure ccmonster
[13:10:22] <sphinxxx> are media queries more reliable than the navigator object?
[13:10:51] <gnarf> and with your mouseover/mouseout down below
[13:11:04] <gnarf> you can shorten that use ?hover
[13:11:04] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:11:26] <gnarf> you could make it using a single hover function too
[13:11:34] <gnarf> since the effect is the exact reverse
[13:12:52] <manizzle> how can i add to http post headers in javascript?
[13:13:41] <hlveheart> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Add+to+HTTP+headers+jQuery o.o
[13:14:09] <gnarf> .hover( function( event ) { var mode = event.type === "mouseenter" ? "+=" : "-="; $( this ).closest( "li" ).animate({ paddingLeft: mode+padding+"px" }, speed); });
[13:14:15] <gnarf> ^^^^ @ricardo_bb|home
[13:14:28] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: see ?closest
[13:14:29] <bot-t> ricardo_bb|home, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:14:29] <hlveheart> Why the HELL is my jQ not validating?! >:|
[13:14:30] <hlveheart> http://jsbin.com/amolaz/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:14:35] <gnarf> its better than .parent for that use
[13:14:47] <gnarf> .parent( "li" ) can't find grandparents
[13:15:23] <ngharo> hlveheart: you're missing the closing parenth
[13:15:27] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: thanks so much, try to follow your input
[13:17:03] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: is the <ul> after the <h2> in the html?
[13:17:13] <gnarf> or are the disconnected ?
[13:17:37] <hlveheart> harro?
[13:18:53] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/RqiZBU6r
[13:19:08] <hlveheart> WHY YOU NO USE JSBIN?
[13:19:59] <nF{> Ok, Im recieve a response from an ajax request as txt
[13:19:59] <ricardo_bb|home> hlveheart: until now i didn't know it exists, started yesterday writing jquery
[13:20:10] <hlveheart> relax man, I joke.
[13:20:16] <nF{> I want to insert part of this text into div id 'filter_list'
[13:20:27] <nF{> whats the jquery? ;\
[13:20:35] <mohadib> jquery is a library
[13:20:41] <mohadib> figured you would know this already
[13:20:42] <hlveheart> jquery is a framework!
[13:20:47] <nF{> ^^
[13:20:50] <nF{> its a framework
[13:20:51] <necromancer> not true
[13:20:56] <hlveheart> I'm very true.
[13:20:57] <Elephant> its a birthday cake
[13:20:59] <nF{> but whats the function to insert into div
[13:21:02] <Elephant> I know this for a fact.
[13:21:06] <mohadib> lol
[13:21:10] <necromancer> a framework changes the way you code. jquery does not
[13:21:12] <hlveheart> ?append
[13:21:12] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[13:21:16] <hlveheart> o.o
[13:21:23] <nF{> I want to replace content
[13:21:24] <necromancer> jquery is an addition to javascript
[13:21:26] <Connor_> Hi, if I am invoking multiple anonymous setTimeout's can there only be one instance?
[13:21:29] <necromancer> and mimics the way JS does things
[13:21:29] <hlveheart> ?html
[13:21:30] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[13:21:30] <nF{> Im trying to load a new set of products
[13:21:31] <mohadib> rtfm
[13:21:35] <mohadib> er
[13:21:51] <necromancer> unlike something like rails
[13:22:24] <gnarf> http://pastebin.com/qWMrmtnx
[13:22:29] <gnarf> @ricardo_bb|home ^^
[13:22:33] <_dave_h_d> hi all, anyone know any good canvas js library which makes it easier to draw shapes
[13:23:17] <danieliser> need to select the next <a> with a class of 'abc' but often each <a> will be the child of its own containers, ie list items or divs.. how can i do something like previous and next
[13:23:46] <Connor_> @danieliser .closest()?
[13:23:48] <necromancer> _dave_h_d: a lot of people like Raphael
[13:23:52] <gnarf> ricardo_bb|home: oops, forgot ro remove line 15 from that paste but yeah
[13:24:01] <hlveheart> (_dave_h_d): http://goo.gl/A9u0g
[13:24:02] <danieliser> can you control the direction? up down in the code?
[13:24:11] <Connor_> It will just find the closest one
[13:24:14] <_dave_h_d> necromancer: thank you, is this open source?
[13:24:15] <Connor_> So not really
[13:24:19] <Connor_> At least I don't think so
[13:24:31] <necromancer> _dave_h_d: http://raphaeljs.com/
[13:24:33] <hlveheart> aren't most libraries, dave?
[13:24:33] <hlveheart> lol
[13:24:35] <danieliser> Connor_: yea i need this for a image gallery next/previous buttons
[13:24:43] <necromancer> pretty sure it's <canvas> compatible though it says W3C SVG on there
[13:24:53] <_dave_h_d> hlveheart: ;-)
[13:25:01] * hlveheart winks.
[13:25:15] <hlveheart> ...did we just flirt in public?
[13:25:19] * hlveheart gets all bashful.
[13:25:32] <Connor_> @danieliser so the issue is you have <a></a> * 5 but sometimes there will be stuff in the <a></a> and doing .next() won't work?
[13:25:42] <Elephant> who flirts in public
[13:25:47] <Elephant> I only flirt solo
[13:25:50] <Elephant> in private
[13:26:00] <necromancer> actually
[13:26:02] <mohadib> yeah hand, looking mighty fine tonight
[13:26:03] <hlveheart> you hit on yourself, ... LITTERALLY
[13:26:04] <gnarf> danieliser: var abcs = $( "a.abc" ); abcs.eq( abcs.index( yourA ) + 1 );
[13:26:07] <necromancer> i don't think it's possible for JS to *not* be open-source
[13:26:23] <Connor_> Question: if I am invoking multiple anonymous setTimeout's can there only be one instance?
[13:26:29] <danieliser> Connor_: more like <li><a><img></a></li><li><a><img></a></li>. and i need to go from <a> to <a>
[13:26:29] <hlveheart> if you encrypt it, it sure can make it LESS open source.
[13:26:31] <hlveheart> but eh.
[13:26:38] <necromancer> that's true
[13:26:47] <hlveheart> alert solves that headache.
[13:26:49] <necromancer> facebook's JS is minified and the filenames are encrypted
[13:26:54] <nF{> $('productlist').html(responseText); isn't working :<
[13:27:08] <danieliser> gnarf: that seems so simple.. yet powerful
[13:27:11] <nF{> Im trying to replace div id="productlist" with new content
[13:27:11] <gnarf> nF{: #productlist
[13:27:23] <Elephant> if you can reverse compiled code, something tells me minified JS isn't a huge hurdle.
[13:27:24] <gnarf> nF{: css selectors inside jQuery()
[13:27:29] <mohadib> nF{: did you look at even the most basic selectord?
[13:27:33] <hlveheart> Lol
[13:27:46] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: thanks, trying it, dosn't seem to work.
[13:27:59] <gnarf> ?doesnt work
[13:28:00] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[13:28:11] <Connor_> @danieliser one sec, will pastebin
[13:28:14] <Elephant> hey its broken
[13:28:23] <hlveheart> I don't know why, bot-t. But you come off as VERY aggressive, and I couldn't be more arroused.
[13:28:26] <danieliser> Connor_: did you see gnarfs solution?
[13:28:29] <kborchers> gnarf: would you mind reading my mind and doing this entire project for me so i don't have to figure it out myself?
[13:28:30] <hlveheart> (sorry to interupt.)
[13:28:51] <gnarf> kborchers: i think i just did that, although you tested all my code
[13:28:56] <Connor_> Ah, that may work if +1 on the last index goes to the originakl
[13:29:00] <gnarf> kborchers: btw, am I clear to push that ?
[13:29:19] <gnarf> kborchers: got any suggestion for commit message? :)
[13:29:28] <kborchers> heh ... i got us part of the way there ... just not the solution
[13:29:45] <kborchers> clear to push yes ... as for a message "Unicorns" ?
[13:30:02] <kborchers> jk
[13:30:20] <ricardo_bb|home> don't think I'm not trying to understand
[13:30:30] <danieliser> Connor_: i can check the length and if it is 0 go to index 0 to go back to the begining
[13:30:57] <ricardo_bb|home> but it's kind of hard to get into this thought model (maybe just for me)
[13:30:59] <danieliser> also allows me to do a filmstrip of thumb nails that when clicked go to the proper index..
[13:31:51] <_dave_h_d> hlveheart:seems to work pretty well :-)
[13:32:02] <Connor_> Yeah gnarf's solutions should work
[13:32:13] <Connor_> I just started writing what came to my head and its exactlly the same :)
[13:32:37] <gnarf> danieliser: yeah, if your doing any sort of slideshow, saving off the collection of slides is pro
[13:32:38] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[13:32:47] <gnarf> you can .eq() it all day long for almost free
[13:32:53] <ricardo_bb|home> pasting it to jsbin gives me warnings, should I ignore it?
[13:33:46] <Connor_> eq() is starting to make sense to me and it is so useful
[13:33:48] <Connor_> <3 it
[13:33:58] <giallu> hi. I'm trying to understand how/if it's possible to do a firebug like hover effect where block elements are highlighted
[13:34:01] <Aquaguy> is there any way to open a file that's on the user's computer with its preferred app from the browser itself? I've made a file browser with a php backend and it works great but I would like to open the files on double click is that even possible?
[13:34:06] <nF{> whats the jquery function replace a set of elements?
[13:34:14] <Connor_> Anyway, question. find() will return an array or object if it finds more than 1?
[13:34:29] <nF{> .html doesn't work
[13:34:41] <kelthar> http://www.drawastickman.com/
[13:35:38] <necromancer> nF{: $('.your-elements').each(function() { $(this).html('stuff'); });
[13:35:39] <aro> is there a good mask plugin for credit card fields? I'd like to mask the input field but still preserve the data.. if that makes sense
[13:35:44] <necromancer> will work
[13:35:47] <nF{> f$('#catalogfilter_list').html(responseText); <--- should replace the htmlright?
[13:35:55] <nF{> necromancer but .html should do this?
[13:36:05] <mohadib> #catalogfilter_list is a div?
[13:36:09] <nF{> its an id
[13:36:13] <necromancer> nF{: you're only selecting one element there
[13:36:17] <mohadib> but what type of element is it
[13:36:23] <necromancer> #catalogfilter_list can only be 1 element
[13:36:26] <mohadib> div span? ul
[13:36:26] <necromancer> since it's an ID
[13:36:34] <nF{> ol class
[13:36:37] <gnarf> Connor_: .find() alwyas returns a jQuery
[13:36:49] <mohadib> then .html wont work on it
[13:36:57] <necromancer> nF{: that's not a class, that's an ID
[13:36:59] <mohadib> as you have discovered
[13:37:04] <gnarf> Connor_: which is to say, it always returns an "array"
[13:37:19] <nF{> err sorry
[13:37:20] <Dykotomee> I've been using "setTimeout(function() { /* code here */ }, 50);" after modifying the DOM to manipulate the added elements. Is there a better way to do this? Seems like waiting 50ms is a little sketchy...
[13:37:21] <nF{> pasted the wrong thing
[13:37:25] <nF{> <div class="category-products" id="catalogfilter_list">
[13:37:29] <Connor_> So this would work: var a = $('.abc').find('li'); a.remove();
[13:37:32] <necromancer> mohadib: why wouldn't something like $('ol').html('<li>something</li>'); work?
[13:37:32] <Connor_> Or something like that?
[13:37:42] <gnarf> Dykotomee: your changes should be available immediately
[13:37:43] <Connor_> So I can use the methods without doing $(a).remove()
[13:37:51] <gnarf> if they aren't you're doing something else wrong
[13:37:52] <necromancer> nF{: what exactly do you want to do?
[13:37:52] <Dykotomee> gnarf: No, they're not.
[13:37:55] <nF{> <div class="category-products" id="catalogfilter_list"> ->>> $('#catalogfilter_list').html(responseText);
[13:37:59] <gnarf> ?p @Dykotomee
[13:37:59] <bot-t> Dykotomee, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:38:00] <mohadib> necromancer: ah that looks legit i guess
[13:38:04] <gnarf> because yes - they are
[13:38:07] <Dykotomee> Okie.
[13:38:13] <gnarf> dom changes reflect IMMEDIATELY - ALWAYS
[13:38:15] <nF{> replace the current document elements with new set of elements
[13:38:17] <mohadib> its not even an ol
[13:38:18] <nF{> i.e. new products
[13:38:21] <mohadib> not according to what was pasted
[13:38:36] <mohadib> did you use firebug and see that anything was being returned?
[13:38:52] <mohadib> or if a js error occured
[13:38:54] <nF{> me?
[13:38:57] <mohadib> yes
[13:39:03] <sphinxxx> anyone know if its possible to get a json or xml string of all the files (the URLs as string) in an amazon s3 bucket?
[13:39:22] <necromancer> nF{: do you want to change every .category-products to responseText?
[13:39:28] <nF{> responsetext is the repsonse of an ajax call which is valid and working
[13:39:28] <necromancer> (the value of responseText)
[13:39:44] <gnarf> nF{: and $ === jQuery ?
[13:39:52] <gnarf> you aren't still using prototype?
[13:39:58] <nF{> no Im using both
[13:40:09] <nF{> Im using prototype to generate the Ajax call
[13:40:15] <gnarf> $ === jQuery ?
[13:40:17] <nF{> s/request
[13:40:28] <hlveheart> navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) {
[13:40:28] <nF{> and now im using jQuery to pass the data back to the client
[13:40:29] <necromancer> nF{: right...but i think you're selecting it wrong
[13:40:34] <gnarf> DOES $ === jQuery ?
[13:40:43] <hlveheart> Would search the entire useragent for android in it, right?
[13:40:50] <Umren> gnarf: why not
[13:40:57] <Connor_> Should I cache every single query result, no matter how many times im going to use it?
[13:41:00] <gnarf> Umren: prototype also uses the $
[13:41:04] <necromancer> if you want to do .html() on a SET of objects, you CAN'T use an id
[13:41:13] <Umren> gnarf: yes, theres compatibility mode if u want use 2
[13:41:21] <gnarf> Umren: orly?
[13:41:37] <danzik171> So this is more of a javascript question, but why not because this is just dumb  (All of this is done in Chrome).  I have a large array (4000 items).  I'm doing a lot of iteration, sorting, whatever on it.  It's taking around 1.5 seconds.  I then do array = JSON.parse( JSON.stringify ( array ));  That same iteration I was doing earlier now takes under 500ms.  W T F?
[13:41:47] <Umren> but why u need outdated prototype anyway gnarf ?
[13:42:08] <nF{> the correct response is being generated within responsetext
[13:42:09] <gnarf> Umren: i'm trying to help someone else
[13:42:19] <gnarf> nF{: console.log( $===jQuery)
[13:42:24] <gnarf> is that shit true or false
[13:42:25] <gnarf> damnit
[13:42:55] <nF{> I know need to replace 'catalogfilterfalse
[13:42:58] <nF{> false :<
[13:43:01] <gnarf> nF{: because if $!==jQuery then that would totally make sense
[13:43:03] <Connor_> Lol
[13:43:07] <aro> is there a good mask plugin for credit card fields? I'd like to mask the input field but still preserve the data.. if that makes sense
[13:43:17] <gnarf> jQuery( "#yourid" ).html( responseText );
[13:43:20] <necromancer> gnarf: he'd get an error, that's obviously not the problem
[13:43:31] <necromancer> iirc prototype doesn't have an .html() method
[13:43:45] <necromancer> nF{: try selecting the class rather than the ID, if you actually want to put the responseText into multiple divs
[13:43:49] <necromancer> which is how this whole bullshit started
[13:44:13] <nF{> necromancer, actually it's one div
[13:44:17] <nF{> with a bunch of li's
[13:44:42] <necromancer> [4:34 PM] <nF{> whats the jquery function replace a set of elements?
[13:44:55] <necromancer> nF{: okay so your responseText includes those <li>'s, right?
[13:45:29] <nF{> yes
[13:45:43] <nF{> it includes the full requested url as text

[13:48:25] <Dykotomee> Fair enough.
[13:48:26] <Connor_> @Dykotomee use .css('width') / .css('height' if you want to get the dimensions when the image is set to auto

[13:52:06] <Dykotomee> Hold on, I'll go get it...
[13:52:16] <StanlySoManly> any ideas why this is broken?  http://jsfiddle.net/sMegL/2/   trying to take stuff from a same-domain iframe and stuff it into a div. it works on firefox and ie8+, but not ie7 and lower. is my code wrong and i'm just lucky that firefox and ie8+ are doing it right?
[13:52:32] <nF{> guys its not working
[13:52:36] <nF{> however
[13:52:44] <nF{> I think it could be prototype
[13:53:14] <Dykotomee> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/jYykT/
[13:53:26] <gnarf> danieliser: are you greying out the screen behind it too?
[13:53:33] <Dykotomee> Not sure whether or not this is a silver bullet, but it works for me.
[13:53:38] <danieliser> yea
[13:53:43] <gnarf> danieliser: because if you don't need to be concerned with events on the background shit
[13:54:02] <danieliser> with a background image centerd of a loading spinner.. so i fade out the container and it shows loading
[13:54:54] <Dykotomee> Does anybody know if jQuery caches selectors?
[13:55:21] <Dykotomee> e.g.: "var $a = $(window); var $b = $(window);" only finds $(window) once?
[13:55:24] <danieliser> Dykotomee: thats basically what i have but if i quickly change the modal to a new width it has to then be recentered.. i want to position it so that its middle point is attatched to the middle point of the window
[13:55:46] <nF{> Guys should this work:
[13:55:47] <nF{> jQuery.ajax({
[13:55:47] <nF{>   url: geturl,
[13:55:47] <nF{>   success: function(){
[13:55:47] <nF{>     jQuery( "catalogfiler_list" ).html( responseText );
[13:55:47] <nF{>   }
[13:55:47] <nF{> });
[13:56:03] <danieliser> could do var $a = $(window); var $b = $a
[13:56:15] <Dykotomee> danieliser: You can recall .center() on it when you resize it.
[13:56:40] <Dykotomee> And re: $a, $b, I know that, it was a for-example.
[13:56:55] <danieliser> i do that but you see the movement on the screen.. it moves across the screen if the change is drastic
[13:57:06] <Dykotomee> Wow, really?
[13:57:07] <Dykotomee> Hmm.
[13:57:11] <Dykotomee> I never noticed with mine.
[13:57:24] <Dykotomee> Maybe you need animation?
[13:57:38] <kborchers> ?ui.position @ danieliser
[13:57:38] <bot-t> danieliser, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[13:57:39] <Dykotomee> Like a jQueryUI resizeTo animation?
[13:58:14] <Layke> Often, people have smooth drags and moving of elements from one area to another. How is that done?
[13:58:32] <Connor_> @Dykotomee, just going back to your image load issue, if you have control over the images you are using you could use a version trick to force the browser to download the image from the server and that would always trigger the load event, I believe
[13:58:44] <Layke> Likie, if you drag something somewhere, then let go, it might pop back elegantly. Or it might do something else.
[13:58:49] <Connor_> Not sure if it works in all browsers but just a thought
[13:59:02] <kborchers> ?draggable @ Layke
[13:59:03] <bot-t> Layke, UI/Draggables/draggable - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/draggable
[13:59:13] <kborchers> ?ui.draggable @ Layke
[13:59:13] <bot-t> Layke, The jQuery UI Draggable plugin makes selected elements draggable by mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[13:59:25] <kborchers> ?ui.droppable @ Layke
[13:59:26] <bot-t> Layke, The jQuery UI Droppable plugin makes selected elements droppable (meaning they accept being dropped on by draggables). http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[13:59:34] <kborchers> ?ui.sortable @ Layke
[13:59:35] <bot-t> Layke, The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[13:59:38] <danieliser> maybe an example is best.. give me a few..
[14:00:36] <Layke> Thanks kborchers. I'm  thinking of the movement like in here. http://worldofsolitaire.com/ and also the "flipping" of cards etc.
[14:02:00] <kborchers> Layke: those things i just showed you will do all of that but the flipping and you can do that with animate i would imagine
[14:02:27] <Connor_> http://css3playground.com/flip-card.php
[14:02:33] <Connor_> CSS3 ftw
[14:02:36] <Aquaguy> Is there any sort of plugin that let's you edit a doc(x), something like google docs?
[14:03:01] <Layke> kborchers, How about being able to do the "soft" drop. Like lets say you were to drag something where it should be. How could I have it move back in an elegant way.
[14:03:36] <nF{> http://pastebin.com/S5z6w2NU I'd be grateful if someone could help -> it's all jQuery
[14:03:36] <kborchers> Layke: did you read those docs?
[14:03:45] <nF{> It's not updating the site with products
[14:03:59] <kborchers> Layke: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#revert
[14:04:02] <nF{> <div class="category-products" id="catalogfilter_list"> is what im trying to replace
[14:05:34] <ShaunR> I'm able to get the value of a input by it's id, what if that input doesnt have a id, anyway to get the value of that input by it's name?
[14:05:45] <Layke> Thanks kborchers. Finally, can the "revert" be a different location. ie, Lets say that I have an Icon of a "Pirates Chest" and I click on it to drag it to my character. After it is dropped, I would like to have an animation which makes the "Chest" fade out and move to the top of the screen where the persons inventory isstored.
[14:05:54] <phzbOx> hi, quick question: When I do $('some-form').submit(function() { console.log('test'); return true; });, it prints 'test' twice. Is it normal?!
[14:05:55] <Layke> Or would I just use move for that.
[14:06:33] <nF{> replaceWith()
[14:06:37] <nF{> will this work for me?
[14:08:12] <kborchers> Layke: at that point i would just make the character a droppable then in the drop event of the droppable, move the item to the new location
[14:08:31] <nF{> ok Im getting somewhere
[14:08:40] <nF{> It's now replacing the right elements
[14:08:43] <nF{> but with the whole new page
[14:08:46] <nF{> not matching element set
[14:09:04] <Layke> cheers kborchers  :)
[14:10:01] <phzbOx> Because I'm trying to avoid "dual posting" the same form.. but for a weird reason, when I do "return true;", it seems to post it again, and recursively call my submit() function. (But only one time)
[14:11:44] <ShaunR> anybody?
[14:12:09] <Connor_> @ShaunR $('input[name="myname"]").val():
[14:12:12] <Connor_> ;*
[14:12:14] <Connor_> Should work
[14:12:42] <ShaunR> k, let me try
[14:13:04] <nF{> http://pastebin.com/S5z6w2NU -> <div class="category-products" id="catalogfilter_list"> is what im trying to replace with new content
[14:13:08] <nF{> nothing is happening
[14:14:15] <gnarf> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/m3qpk/
[14:14:16] <prgmctan> hi, I'm wondering how I access my original element after an event and ajax call?
[14:14:19] <gnarf> danieliser: mostly css only
[14:14:26] <Connor_> how many #catalogfiler_list are on the page @nF{
[14:14:29] <nF{> one
[14:14:35] <Connor_> What is in it
[14:14:35] <gnarf> the only lynch pin is setting the height of the outer wrap to be equal to the height of the inner content
[14:15:19] <SEJeff_work> On a select, $("select").serialize() is returning name=value&name=value2&name=value3, is there a way to make it return name=value,value2,value3?
[14:15:20] <danieliser> gnarf:looks interesting.. will try it when i get back. Ty.
[14:15:31] <nF{> Connor_ bunch of li's
[14:15:37] <SEJeff_work> Because my server is only seeing the very last name= and not all of them
[14:15:38] <gnarf> danieliser: basically you abuse the hell out of css
[14:15:40] <nF{> (list of products for ecommerce store)
[14:15:49] <gnarf> Dykotomee: you should look at that fiddle too :)
[14:15:55] <Connor_> And you are trying to replace all those products with the data right?
[14:15:57] <danieliser> gnarf: thats what i figured had to happen..
[14:17:05] <nF{> yes
[14:17:10] <nF{> sorry theres also a few div's in here
[14:17:12] <nF{> there*
[14:17:24] <Connor_> Pastebin what is in ResponseText
[14:17:30] <danieliser> gnarf: working example. http://sandbox.wizardinternetsolutions.com/
[14:18:04] <nF{> http://pastebin.com/kQ7Y1666
[14:18:30] <nF{> ignore first 11 lines
[14:18:32] <nF{> :>>
[14:19:05] <gnarf> danieliser: the #wrap2 in that fiddle gets the size of the relative .content, so it doesn't need to be told the width of the content
[14:19:12] <Connor_> Error logs not showing anything?
[14:19:30] <nF{> nope
[14:19:43] <nF{> it's returning the correct responseText
[14:19:47] <Connor_> What if you don't do html(responseText) just do some random string
[14:19:59] <Connor_> html('This is my amazing awesome suprt string');
[14:20:16] <Connor_> That is supposed to say super
[14:20:20] <Connor_> Anyway
[14:20:23] <Connor_> Try that and see if it works
[14:20:51] <nF{> ok, nothing
[14:21:02] <nF{> but if I change it to match the id of the div
[14:21:04] <nF{> it works
[14:21:20] <nF{> <div class="category-products" id="catalogfilter_list"> using 'category-products'
[14:21:33] <nF{> but now its just replacing it with the whole of responseText, not matching elements
[14:21:38] <danieliser> gnarf: looks about right.  css needs an additional position method grid
[14:22:02] <gnarf> danieliser: its dirty on top of dirty tricks going on there
[14:22:05] <danieliser> where 0,0 referes to the center of the object
[14:22:08] <Connor_> It's not supposed to match elements
[14:22:24] <Connor_> It is essentially destroying anything inside category-products and replacing it with responseText
[14:22:24] <nF{> http://armor101.com/store/bullet-proof-vests.html -> 'click 1,2 or next'
[14:22:32] <nF{> oh ok
[14:22:37] <Connor_> That is what html does
[14:22:39] <nF{> I thought it replaced it with matching elements
[14:22:47] <nF{> or matching div
[14:22:58] <Connor_> Nah, it would be easier to make up the list in the file you are getting and then html'ing it in
[14:23:20] <Connor_> + HTML'ing in a full page is gonna be slow as shit
[14:23:32] <nF{> ok so what should I do?
[14:23:36] <gnarf> danieliser: its a 100% wide outer container, position absolute, height set to content height...
[14:23:40] <Connor_> Are you querying a php file or something?
[14:23:55] <Connor_> Or just a html page
[14:23:57] <nF{> no a .html page
[14:24:00] <gnarf> danieliser: stack inside of it a inner container, 50% top, 50% right, position absolute
[14:24:12] <Connor_> In an ideal world you would query a file that generates JUST the li's you need
[14:24:15] <nF{> literally trying to replace the main content of page1.html with page2.hml
[14:24:17] <gnarf> oh outer container is 50% bottom
[14:24:33] <gnarf> then the content itself floats left, position relative, left: 50%
[14:24:37] <nF{> can we not generate this inline?
[14:24:46] <danieliser> thanks all gotta get outa here or ima be late.. will let you know how that works out.
[14:25:02] <nF{> is there no way to easily parse the response text data?
[14:25:07] <Connor_> Uh, I guess you could if you had all the products on the page and instead of querying a file you just hide/show ul's
[14:25:09] <nF{> or no function suitable in jQuery to replace it
[14:25:28] <nF{> I presumed jQuery had a replace function
[14:25:37] <Connor_> Tbh querying a whole file is so bad it makes my eyes bleed
[14:25:48] <ricardo_bb|home> gnarf: thanks again. have a good day.
[14:26:10] <Connor_> It will be extremlley slow and your bandwidth with double,,tripley,quadruple etc
[14:26:13] <nF{> Connor_, appreciated
[14:26:19] <nF{> Help me do this the best way
[14:26:33] <Connor_> Find whatever function or class generates the product list
[14:26:51] <Connor_> Then create a seperate PHP file that class that class/function with a query parameter and then query that on each click
[14:26:55] <kborchers> gnarf: did i miss something earlier or was he just trying to keep something centered on scroll?
[14:27:01] <Connor_> So eg you would quey get_products.php?page=x
[14:27:06] <hlvehearttraffic> There's going to be a lot of it.
[14:27:16] <hlvehearttraffic> Anywho guys. have a good rest of your day :}
[14:27:23] <Connor_> It's not really something I can tell you step by step how to do
[14:28:07] <zivester> is there a way to search backwards from a particular place in the DOM.. so basically I want to find if '.needle' exists before a particular element anywhere
[14:28:29] <Connor_> .prev('.needle')
[14:28:35] <Connor_> Or
[14:28:35] <kborchers> ?closest @ zivester
[14:28:35] <bot-t> zivester, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:28:43] <Connor_> prevAll('.needle')
[14:29:11] <nF{> Connor_, actually I think Im already doing this
[14:29:34] <Connor_> Could be, but at least not on the page you are showing me
[14:29:40] <nF{> Im basically on: /blah?p=1 and Im calling /blah?p=2
[14:30:08] <Connor_> Test
[14:30:10] <Connor_> Silly IRC
[14:30:11] <Connor_> Anyway
[14:30:20] <zivester> ill try closest.. i dont know if that's right though
[14:30:21] <Connor_> blah?p=2 returns the fully generated page
[14:30:24] <Connor_> You don't want that
[14:30:29] <Connor_> You want just the li's
[14:30:55] <Connor_> Is an ajax pagination something that you have to do? Tbh it would be much easier just to make it a normal pagination :P
[14:31:02] <manizzle> can someone help me figure out how to modify the http headers on a form post request?
[14:31:05] <nF{> Yea
[14:31:12] <nF{> it's for a Magento eCommerce store
[14:31:18] <Connor_> I see
[14:31:28] <nF{> in prototype you can do innerHtml
[14:31:35] <nF{> and it replaces only the matching elements
[14:31:49] <Connor_> I mean sure, you could find a function that does something similar
[14:31:53] <Connor_> It's an option
[14:32:00] <Connor_> Not a very good one, but an option
[14:33:00] <nF{> Is anyone aware of a function
[14:33:04] <nF{> I know its not optimal
[14:33:08] <nF{> but atleast i can go to bed :P
[14:33:33] <Connor_> Not sure sorry
[14:33:35] <jedimind> im aware of several functions
[14:33:35] <Danielss89> Hi..
[14:33:49] <nF{> jedimind ...
[14:33:50] <jedimind> you can now sleep easy
[14:34:01] <nF{> what are they? ;\
[14:34:04] <Danielss89> i have a menu drop down on click on a div, but how can i say "if clicked outside drop down menu, then hide the menu"
[14:34:20] <jedimind> all the functions that i know? there are lots of them
[14:34:24] <jedimind> i dont know what specific one you're looking for
[14:34:30] <Danielss89> i have a drop down when nu which is shown with click on a div *
[14:34:36] <Danielss89> nu = menu -.-
[14:34:45] <jedimind> when nu = menu
[14:34:52] <nF{> jedimind, that will replace a block of html
[14:35:09] <jedimind> $('#container').html('some new html here');
[14:35:13] <nF{> Yes
[14:35:22] <nF{> but the new html is a complete page
[14:35:27] <nF{> and I need only matching elements
[14:35:28] <Industrialist> The skilless masses are my people, and I have come to torture them.
[14:36:10] <Connor_> @Danielss89 create an overlay when on he dropdown that is z-indexed above everything except the dropdown
[14:36:14] <jedimind> $('#container').load('newpage.html #somesection');
[14:36:48] <jedimind> nF{, http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:36:49] <Connor_> Then do $('.overlay').click(function() { $(this).remove(); closemyDropdownfunction(); });
[14:36:58] <Danielss89> connor ok.. is that the best method?
[14:37:03] <Connor_> Probably :P
[14:37:04] <Connor_> Easiest
[14:37:12] <Connor_> I wouldn't add the overlay in via js though
[14:37:15] <nF{> jedmind, the page is a reponse from ajax request
[14:37:16] <Connor_> That would cause a refloow
[14:37:18] <nF{> responseText
[14:37:19] <Connor_> And reflows are bad!
[14:37:20] <nF{> will this work?
[14:37:36] <jedimind> use load instead of .ajax
[14:37:43] <Connor_> It would be a fast and optimial way of doing it
[14:37:46] <jedimind> im guessing you're submitting a form ?
[14:37:49] <Connor_> Don't see any reason why not to do it that way
[14:37:59] <nF{> jedimind, no Im replacing a list of products
[14:38:03] <nF{> in the main content
[14:38:11] <jedimind> so just use .load instead of .ajax
[14:41:04] <Connor_> If am doing $('.manyElements').each(function() { setTimeout(someFunction, 123); }); will that run someFunction every 123 seconds?
[14:41:29] <Danielss89> hmm Connor_ i still want the user to be able to click other places
[14:42:00] <Connor_> Uhm, then z-index them ontop too
[14:42:25] <Danielss89> well then its not the click on the overlay is it=
[14:42:27] <nF{> jedimind jQuery( 'div.category-products' ).load(geturl 'div.category-products');
[14:42:30] <nF{> should this work?
[14:42:35] <enjoycrf> how come my ajax complete is not firing when in unload
[14:42:39] <nF{> im getting: missing ) after argument list
[14:42:45] <Connor_> Well it depends where you are clicking
[14:43:02] <Danielss89> if i position a link on top of overlay, does the click then apply to overlay?
[14:43:14] <Danielss89> if the link is clicked?
[14:43:21] <Connor_> Not if you click the link, but clicking anywhere other than the link then yes it will register as an overlay click
[14:43:32] <jedimind> no its
[14:43:41] <Danielss89> well i want the user to be able to click the link and hide the menu :D
[14:43:47] <Connor_> Wat
[14:43:48] <jedimind> .load(geturl + ' div.category-products') (pay attention to the space as well
[14:43:49] <Connor_> What does the link do
[14:44:01] <Danielss89> change som html
[14:44:25] <Connor_> Then keep it z-indexed on top but create a function hide the overlay and then call that function when the lnik is clicked in JS
[14:44:29] <Connor_> Make sense?
[14:44:40] <Connor_> And when the overlay is clicked
[14:44:49] <Connor_> So you could bind multiple elements to that function
[14:45:04] <nF{> jedimind, load works like ajax?
[14:45:13] <Danielss89> that seems like a lot of work if i have many different links on many page.. it can't be optimal
[14:45:18] <Connor_> $('.element, .element2').click(closeOverlay());
[14:45:20] <jedimind> similar to it, read the documentation
[14:45:36] <Connor_> Create a class for the links that you want to close the overlay on click
[14:45:56] <nF{> jedimind
[14:46:03] <nF{> you are awesome, thank you so much
[14:46:13] <Danielss89> wouldnt it be easier to bind a function to the click event and then check if the click happened inside the menu?
[14:46:14] <jedimind> no problem brother
[14:46:22] <nF{> it works, thats perfect, Ive been stuck on this for hours
[14:46:26] <Connor_> Wait, the links are inside the content?
[14:46:30] <nF{> Can't beleive its one line of code
[14:46:33] <Connor_> inside the dropdown sorry
[14:46:33] <Danielss89> no
[14:46:42] <nF{> :<
[14:46:52] <Danielss89> but the drop down is showed on every page
[14:46:56] <nF{> I wrote 20 line functions in prototype and for hours it didnt work
[14:46:57] <jedimind> nF{, thats the beauty of jquery :)
[14:47:03] <nF{> and one line of code
[14:47:05] <nF{> crazy
[14:47:08] <nF{> I feel like crying :P
[14:47:10] <jedimind> you always start with like 100 lines of code and then go backwards and end up with nothing
[14:47:15] <Connor_> Okay, but are the links you want clickable in the dropdown?
[14:47:19] <Connor_> Or somewhere else on the page
[14:47:21] <jedimind> i jsut wrote a form validator that ended up being 1.56kb in total
[14:47:35] <enjoycrf> prototype is kinda old hehe
[14:47:35] <Danielss89> somwhere else..
[14:47:46] <enjoycrf> but was cool
[14:47:50] <Connor_> Well you could bind a function to EVERY click event but damn that would be expensive
[14:47:55] <nF{> basically i bought a module fo some russians for magento, written in prototype
[14:48:05] <nF{> but didnt work prperly so decide to fix it myself =\
[14:48:30] <Connor_> Faster just to check if a certain class has been clicked
[14:49:24] <enjoycrf> hey guys!!!!!
[14:49:28] <enjoycrf> which is better
[14:49:34] <enjoycrf> BBQ or RSH
[14:49:48] <Connor_> Wat
[14:49:54] <Aristata> jQuery is cool
[14:50:10] <Brodingo> YEAH!
[14:50:11] <jedimind> enjoycrf, depends on what you need
[14:50:13] <Aristata> :)
[14:50:16] <enjoycrf> both are history hashing plugins
[14:50:26] <RoosterJuice> if i had a form
[14:50:29] <enjoycrf> jedi they serve the same purpose
[14:50:30] <RoosterJuice> that added things to a list
[14:50:32] <enjoycrf> wat u mean?
[14:50:36] <enjoycrf> wat i want
[14:50:48] <enjoycrf> ive used RSH
[14:50:50] <RoosterJuice> what would I use to do that without a page load?
[14:50:51] <jedimind> well, BBQ is more robust, but RSH is more lightweight and fine for most simple implementations
[14:50:53] <enjoycrf> but havent used bbq
[14:51:03] <RoosterJuice> er post back
[14:51:04] <RoosterJuice> rather
[14:51:22] <enjoycrf> yeah it looked like rsh was more light to me too
[14:51:46] <enjoycrf> but i like how bbq uses jquery
[14:51:46] <jedimind> though ... now that i look at it again after a while, it seems liek it's bloated
[14:51:54] <enjoycrf> exactly
[14:51:59] <enjoycrf> hahaha
[14:52:05] <jedimind> yeah go bbq route if you're using jquery anyway
[14:52:09] <enjoycrf> i am at bbq download page
[14:52:11] <jedimind> its' 4k vs 22k
[14:52:24] <enjoycrf> but was giving it a final thot
[14:52:55] <jedimind> ive only ever used bbq in production, i played with rsh a while ago but never found a real usage for it if you've already got jquery you're using
[14:52:56] <enjoycrf> i might as well use bbq just to learn it
[14:53:01] <enjoycrf> since i already know rsh
[14:53:24] <enjoycrf> fuk it amirite?
[14:53:30] <Aristata> The name bbq turns me off
[14:53:34] <enjoycrf> me too
[14:53:46] <enjoycrf> but its prety nice code
[14:54:00] <jedimind> haha
[14:54:01] <Aristata> I am the type of person that would never use a library if it was named something I don't like. And I hate bbq sause.
[14:54:09] <Aristata> Makes me feel icky jsut thinking about it
[14:54:20] <enjoycrf> and bbq stands for back button query
[14:54:37] <Aristata> Well, if it was written out that way all the time I would use it!
[14:54:43] <jedimind> haha
[14:54:43] <enjoycrf> so it actually makes sense
[14:55:11] <maria_zk> hi, i was wondering if someone could help me? I have a search form and on submit it displays the resilts in a div at the bottom. How could I have an auto scroll to the results div after the form submit?
[14:55:37] <jedimind> maria_zk, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[14:55:45] <enjoycrf> ok bbq officially going in
[14:56:12] <enjoycrf> the creator says he got help in this room here lol
[14:56:24] <enjoycrf> perhaps i helped him lol
[14:56:32] <maria_zk> jedimind: yes i am there, thank you.
[14:56:38] <maria_zk> only that, i cannot make it work :(
[14:56:55] <maria_zk> I am not sure I understand the documentation...
[14:57:12] <jedimind> ah i gotta jet in 3 minutes so cant really help, sorry, someone else help this person?
[14:57:14] <maria_zk> jquery is fine and the scroll to js iloaded.
[14:57:33] <maria_zk> ah. well, thank you for responding :)
[14:57:44] <Connor_> Sorry don't know anything about the plugin to be of any use :(
[14:58:04] <maria_zk> is this the only way to scroll to a dom?
[14:58:56] <enjoycrf> yo maria wats the problem
[14:59:10] <maria_zk> hey :)
[14:59:15] <maria_zk> here's the thing:
[14:59:30] <maria_zk> i have a form that submits reasults with ajax on a dom
[14:59:44] <maria_zk> i need to scroll to this dom automatically after form submit
[15:00:10] <maria_zk> am I explaining this correctly?
[15:01:23] <Connor_> What about http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jquerylocalscroll-10.html
[15:01:28] <Connor_> Seems pretty easy to implement
[15:01:58] <Layke> If you were going to make something like tetris, what would you use? Canvas? or just use the DOM to manipulate positions etc. I've never used canvas.
[15:02:38] <Connor_> I can only imagine canvas would be better
[15:02:40] <Connor_> But never used it
[15:02:52] <maria_zk> Connor: yes but, on form submit?
[15:03:14] <maria_zk> I mean, I do not have a link to use as an achor...
[15:04:19] <Connor_> I take it the form submit isn't actually going anywhere?
[15:04:25] <Connor_> Not reloading the page?
[15:04:31] <enjoycrf> its ajax
[15:04:40] <enjoycrf> wat u mean scroll the dom lol
[15:04:49] <maria_zk> yes
[15:04:51] <Connor_> So you can just create an anchor and then use localScroll to scroll to that anchor
[15:05:03] <Connor_> In the submti function
[15:05:18] <Connor_> submit(function() { manyCodesGoHere });

[15:05:46] <DofLeFou> Greetings
[15:05:52] <maria_zk> Connor: yes, this was my question :)
[15:06:06] <maria_zk> i didn;t know how to handle the event
[15:06:20] <Connor_> It's just an event, so you can do it like that or use bind()
[15:06:21] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: scroll toward the dom, i mean
[15:06:25] <Connor_> Like click and hover etc
[15:06:36] <enjoycrf> what does that mean
[15:06:39] <maria_zk> tried clicked but couldn;t make it
[15:06:40] <ravenzz> maria_zk do you need effects?
[15:06:46] <enjoycrf> dom is a tree of html
[15:06:58] <Connor_> Well submit is what you need anyway
[15:06:59] <nF{> Any idea why Im getting ught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'CreateBubblePopup'
[15:07:05] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: imagine a form. on submit, it shows the results in a div.
[15:07:12] <enjoycrf> ok
[15:07:14] <nF{> could this be due to prototype being loaded as well as jquery/
[15:07:23] <maria_zk> the q is how to scroll automatically to that div after a user clicks submit
[15:07:30] <maria_zk> ravenzz: just the functionality
[15:07:39] <enjoycrf> i see
[15:08:07] <Connor_> @nF{ CreateBubblePopup isn't a standard jquery function, you need to make sure that you have the plugin related to that function included
[15:08:11] <Connor_> And configured properly
[15:08:12] <enjoycrf> scroll or just go to
[15:08:17] <nF{> yes it's included at the top
[15:08:22] <nF{> Im trying to use a jquery plugin
[15:08:23] <maria_zk> it is an ajax form btw, but the div is already there, having some other stuff in it. after submit, contents are being replaced with the search results
[15:08:31] <maria_zk> whatever is easier
[15:08:38] <enjoycrf> cause if its a simple go to just use a anchor
[15:08:55] <Connor_> Got a link nF{
[15:09:09] <enjoycrf> and then in ur submit ajax complete
[15:09:15] <maria_zk> how to handle the trigger?
[15:09:40] <nF{> http://armor101.com/store/bullet-proof-vests.html
[15:09:50] * zackiv31 test
[15:09:50] <enjoycrf> do u know how to put code in oncomplete:
[15:10:12] <maria_zk> i have this function here: 	function ajaxComplete (request, textStatus) { $("#search_results").removeClass ("semi-transparent"); }
[15:10:38] <enjoycrf> yeah in there i guess
[15:10:55] <enjoycrf> but u have to make an anchor first
[15:11:11] <enjoycrf> in that result div
[15:11:16] <Connor_> @nF{ try and use the un-packged version of bubblepopup, it may be that the methods are being renamed
[15:11:28] <sparuvu> does anyone know the fix for "table.config.parsers is undefined " with the table sorter plugin
[15:11:33] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: ok, so i create the anchor
[15:11:48] <enjoycrf> paste it
[15:11:50] <maria_zk> and call the scrollto local in the above function?
[15:12:01] <nF{> Connor_ have you used this plugin before?
[15:12:06] <Connor_> No
[15:12:23] <Connor_> @maria_zk only if you want the actual animation of scrolling
[15:12:35] <sparuvu> I found couple of work arounds for it here â¦.http://code.google.com/p/tablesorter/issues/detail?id=2#c6 but no luck
[15:12:38] <sparuvu> its not working
[15:12:39] <sparuvu> for me
[15:13:03] <Connor_> @sparuvu do you have a demo/link?
[15:13:23] <sparuvu> you mean my code ????
[15:13:30] <maria_zk> and if not?
[15:13:57] <Connor_> Or the page that it isn't working on
[15:14:06] <Connor_> @maria_zk there shoudl be a way to just jump to the anchor
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> /get the top offset of the target anchor
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> 14	        var target_offset = $("#"+trgt).offset();
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> 15	        var target_top = target_offset.top;
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> 16	
[15:14:09] <enjoycrf> 17	        //goto that anchor by setting the body scroll top to anchor top
[15:14:10] <enjoycrf> 18	        $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:target_top}, 500);
[15:14:18] <ccmonster> enjoycrf, dont paste in the room please
[15:14:36] <enjoycrf> its not prety but i guess thers no prety way yet
[15:14:43] <sparuvu> Connor_ : it works fine if the data is static but it wouldn't if the data comes from an ajax call
[15:14:51] <bsod2> there is always pastebin
[15:14:59] <enjoycrf> seems like simple grunt work there
[15:15:00] <sparuvu> its a straight copy paste from the plugin home page....
[15:15:04] <Connor_> What does the actual call look like
[15:15:15] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: trying it...
[15:15:16] <Connor_> Is it doing something like $('.someClass').amazingPlugin(); ?
[15:15:27] <ccmonster> var target = $('#"+trgt); $('html,body').animate({scrollTop:target.offset().top},500)
[15:16:03] <sparuvu> connor_: http://pastebin.com/kNNJeMcR
[15:16:47] <Connor_> And you are ajaxing in another #myTable?
[15:17:36] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: $("#"+trgt).offset(); that should be $("#myanchor"+trgt).offset();
[15:17:38] <maria_zk> right?
[15:18:06] <enjoycrf> ya
[15:18:10] <sparuvu> yeah â¦.my ajax call fills the data at some other function
[15:18:21] <enjoycrf> ur trying to find where ur anchor is on the page
[15:18:22] <sparuvu> once the table is filled then I am making a call to this trigger
[15:18:26] <ravenzz> maria_zk http://jsfiddle.net/98NW5/
[15:19:37] <Connor_> Uhm, my only suggestion is using delegate instead of trigegr
[15:19:43] <Connor_> Because you are adding elements into the DOM
[15:19:45] <jcrawford> anyone here that may be able to assist with an issue I am having with the daterangepicker plugin from fillamentgroup?  The outline of my issue is posted here: http://pastebin.com/TXEgzitP
[15:19:46] <enjoycrf> precisely
[15:19:53] <Connor_> But if #myTable is always there then I don't that it is it
[15:20:00] <Connor_> I don't really know the plugin so I am not sure
[15:20:38] <Vaidotas> hello
[15:21:02] <Vaidotas> how to set for all componenets with some class other class
[15:21:04] <Vaidotas> $(\".links\").toggleClass('active');
[15:21:07] <Vaidotas> is not working
[15:21:55] <Connor_> Are those \ there by accident?
[15:22:09] <Connor_> @jcrawford looking now
[15:22:27] <jcrawford> I will be happy to paypal whomever can assist me with resolving this issue a donation for your time, this is something I really really want to fix lol.  I contacted the plugin author and the response I got was try online, never had that response from a company/person who put out OSS lol
[15:22:35] <DofLeFou> I have Table A and Table B â¦. Now I m trying to hide Column 5 of Table A and I added the following statement â¦ $('td:nth-child(5),th:nth-child(5)').hide(); â¦ My issue is that statement also hides Table B column 5
[15:22:36] <jcrawford> thanks Connor_
[15:23:06] <DofLeFou> How do I pass in the Table I want to hide its column?
[15:23:15] <jcrawford> if you get confused I can explain it more clearly for you, basically the text box shows the proper value but $("#datepicker').val() is returning an incorrect value
[15:23:17] <DofLeFou> Can I use the Table ID?
[15:24:03] <Vaidotas> Connor_ its for php
[15:24:31] <jcrawford> DofLeFou: give each table an id then call $('#table td:nth-child......
[15:24:48] <jcrawford> you would need to try it though, i am just starting with Jquery so i may be wrong :)
[15:25:07] <maria_zk> enjoycrf: ravenzz it works
[15:25:07] <Connor_> If you are trying to select multiple tables using an ID will only return one element
[15:25:17] <maria_zk> thank you soooooooooo much
[15:25:20] <enjoycrf> nice
[15:25:25] <maria_zk> Connor thanks you as weel
[15:25:28] <maria_zk> well
[15:25:28] * ravenzz work
[15:25:42] <maria_zk> i really appreciate this ...
[15:25:43] <Connor_> Np
[15:25:52] <maria_zk> you guys are amazing :)
[15:26:05] <enjoycrf> ravenz lick my toes plz
[15:26:15] <maria_zk> haahaahahha
[15:26:49] <jcrawford> Connor_: the way i understood DofLeFou he didn't want to select both tables which is why I had suggested the use of ID's
[15:26:57] <Connor_> Ah I see
[15:27:06] <DofLeFou> jcrawford: That did it
[15:27:09] <DofLeFou> thank you
[15:27:22] <jcrawford> good to hear DofLeFou, no problem glad I could help lol
[15:27:25] <delfis> [01:24:06] <Vaidotas> Connor_ its for php
[15:27:25] <delfis> [01:24:28] <Vaidotas> $(\".links\").show(1000);  this works
[15:27:25] <delfis> [01:24:33] <Vaidotas> $(\".links\").toggleClass('active');
[15:27:25] <delfis> [01:24:34] <Vaidotas> this not
[15:27:25] <delfis> [01:24:36] <Vaidotas> why :?
[15:27:30] <delfis> sorry, internet down
[15:27:55] <Connor_> What is the active class actually do
[15:27:57] <jcrawford> Vaidotas: could you show the PHP code with the JS so I could see how it is getting generated?
[15:28:27] <jcrawford> Vaidotas: I would suggest using single quotes around your php strings so that you won't have to escape the double quotes like you are showing above
[15:28:40] <delfis> maybe
[15:28:44] <delfis> i`ll paste in bin
[15:28:53] <delfis> source code
[15:29:00] <jcrawford> oh sorry delfis just noticed the nick change :)
[15:29:24] <jcrawford> Connor_: any chance you see anything obviously wrong with my code?
[15:29:38] <Connor_> Just trying to figure it out the actual issue atm
[15:29:51] <Connor_> Don't understand what 'selecting the last 7 days' means
[15:30:01] <delfis> http://paste2.org/p/1665716
[15:30:04] <delfis> this is all the script
[15:30:23] <jcrawford> Connor_: one moment will get an online demo to show you
[15:30:27] <delfis> $(".links").toggleClass('active'); this is not working for compactAll and expandAll
[15:30:31] <jcrawford> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/
[15:30:45] <jcrawford> delfis: looking now, moment
[15:31:30] <jcrawford> delfis: is this online where I can hit the url and see it?
[15:31:56] <delfis> no
[15:32:23] <jcrawford> delfis: does expandAll, compactAll I mean when you click does that function get executed?
[15:32:33] <nF{> Any idea why Im getting ught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'CreateBubblePopup' <----- calling a function within an included JS file, possible cross comaptibiltiy with prototype?
[15:32:41] <LuckySMack> im calling a method, function Foo(){}  that should return a "string". Foo gets the string by doing $.post('path', function(data){ ...some stuff...} . I have determined that data does actually = "string" but whenever I try to return it, the calling method just gets undefined. So when using $.post how can I return data's value back to the calling method.
[15:32:45] <delfis> yes
[15:32:46] <delfis> it works
[15:32:47] <delfis> :)
[15:32:58] <enjoycrf> does jquery set doc titles as well?
[15:33:00] <jcrawford> so its just the toggleClass that does not appear to work?
[15:33:06] <enjoycrf> i mean page titles
[15:33:06] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: you don't.
[15:33:11] <enjoycrf> <title>
[15:33:38] <ajpiano> you can't return the return value of a callback that is passed to an asynchronous function as the value of the function to which it was passed
[15:34:07] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[15:34:15] <jcrawford> delfis: is .links a single element on the page or does every link have that class?
[15:34:15] <enjoycrf> # $(document).attr('title','Whatever');
[15:34:25] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: just use document.title = "foo"
[15:34:27] <delfis> every
[15:34:28] <jcrawford> if it is more than one item you might have to use each to iterate over them to toggleClass
[15:34:34] <enjoycrf> why
[15:34:36] <LuckySMack> ajpiano, ok, reading.
[15:34:40] <jcrawford> but I am not sure on that someone else here might be able to explain that
[15:34:50] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: because title isn't an attribute of a document
[15:35:03] <ajpiano> it's clearly the simplest and most right way
[15:35:05] <delfis> could you show me how to iterate? :)
[15:35:08] <enjoycrf> is that crossbrowser
[15:35:09] <ajpiano> i'm not sure why you'd entertain any other option
[15:35:12] <ajpiano> yes
[15:35:47] <jcrawford> I *THINK* $('.links').each( this.toggleClass('active') );
[15:35:49] <enjoycrf> window.location.hash = o.id;
[15:35:49] <enjoycrf> 		document.title = o.name;
[15:35:50] <enjoycrf> ?
[15:35:55] <jcrawford> but that could be VERY wrong, wait for someone else to confirm
[15:36:02] <ajpiano> jcrawford: that is wrong
[15:36:06] <ajpiano> for two reasons
[15:36:07] <jcrawford> ajpiano: thanks :)
[15:36:16] <jcrawford> i am still very new to jq
[15:36:19] <ajpiano> a) $("foo").each( function() { //doStuff });
[15:36:30] <ajpiano> b) things that are on the jQuery prototype hit all the elements in the set
[15:36:32] <ajpiano> so you can do
[15:36:40] <ajpiano> $("div").toggleClass("bar") and it will do it to all divs
[15:36:55] <delfis> this.toggleClass is not a function
[15:36:58] <delfis> firebug
[15:37:02] <jcrawford> oh that i was not aware of, in that case delfis I was wrong about having to iterate
[15:37:17] <jcrawford> ajpiano: explained why what i said would not work :)
[15:37:27] <ravenzz> delfis this is not a jQuery element
[15:37:27] <abjorn> asdf
[15:37:31] <delfis> shit
[15:37:32] <ajpiano> jcrawford: you have to pass a function reference to an iterator like .each, not "What would be the body of a function"
[15:38:01] <delfis> why this is not working
[15:38:04] <jcrawford> and your $('.links').toggleClass('active'); should be working but if it is not, maybe ajpiano or another member here can assist....  I tried :( sorry
[15:38:08] <delfis> neverming, going to sleep
[15:38:17] <ravenzz> best choice
[15:38:17] <delfis> *nevermind
[15:38:21] <ravenzz> \o
[15:38:22] <ajpiano> delfis: is it in side of a document ready block?
[15:38:22] <LuckySMack> ajpiano, ok so if I need to do *anything* with data, it has to be done inside the $.post call method. Right? once it leaves the $.post the variables are then cleared and out of scope.
[15:38:30] <delfis> yes
[15:38:36] <jcrawford> ajpiano: his code looks fine to me: http://paste2.org/p/1665716
[15:38:43] <ajpiano> LuckySMack: not necessarily inside of an anonymous callback right there
[15:38:47] <jcrawford> the .shows seem to be working just not the toggleClass
[15:38:54] <delfis> yeah
[15:38:55] <jcrawford> if i understood him correctly
[15:38:56] <ajpiano> but in some sort of flow that is invoked *by* the callback, not the calling function
[15:38:59] <delfis> everything else works
[15:39:16] <rogeruiz> Hey everyone. I'm having a really strange jquery ui datepicker bug. Can I just ask it here?
[15:39:25] <ajpiano> yes
[15:39:34] <rogeruiz> The issue is happening in ie7
[15:39:41] <nF{> Anyone wanna helpme debug a plugin :DDDDDDDdd
[15:39:42] * ajpiano leaves
[15:39:43] <jcrawford> rogeruiz: does it have to do with .val() returning the wrong value?
[15:39:50] <rogeruiz> Nope
[15:39:51] <ajpiano> :p
[15:39:52] <jcrawford> because that's the issue I am having :)
[15:39:57] <jcrawford> bye ajpiano
[15:40:04] <abjorn> don't ask if anyone wants to help, just ask away
[15:40:07] <jcrawford> Connor_: any ideas ?
[15:40:07] <rogeruiz> The datepicker freezes after a selection
[15:40:22] <rogeruiz> Thanks. I wasn't sure if I was in the right room
[15:40:29] <Connor_> Still looking at it, think it is something to do with the core plugin code
[15:40:33] <rogeruiz> But the other is the dev channel
[15:40:38] <delfis> oh shit
[15:40:41] <delfis> sorry everyone
[15:40:45] <jcrawford> hmm so it is the 3rd party plugin that has the issue, good to know it's not my code :)
[15:40:48] <delfis> i really need sleep
[15:40:55] <delfis> $(\"h4.highlight\").toggleClass('active');
[15:41:00] <jcrawford> delfis: lol what was the issue?
[15:41:02] <enjoycrf> yeah bbq is good
[15:41:05] <delfis> links wasn`t what i want
[15:41:05] <delfis> :D
[15:41:12] <jcrawford> HAHA
[15:41:15] <Connor_> Think it saves it in .data not in .val when it has a custom option
[15:41:18] <nF{> abjorn, jQuery(".button").CreateBubblePopup is not a function
[15:41:18] <nF{> [Break On This Error] jQuery('.button').CreateBubblePopu...erHtml: 'This is a Bubble Popup!' });
[15:41:19] <enjoycrf> most things that i had to type out in RSH is automated in BBQ
[15:41:25] <nF{> even though the right js file is included
[15:41:30] <delfis> good night :)
[15:41:36] <jcrawford> let me see what happens when I use data, do i use that just like val >?
[15:41:46] <Connor_> Should do yes
[15:41:55] <Connor_> Probably won't work :P
[15:42:12] <jcrawford> ok well data returns [object Object]
[15:42:23] <rogeruiz> By freeze. I mean that the datepicker loses the ability to select a date. Currently it's attached to a div inside of a container div that is being hidden and shown
[15:42:42] <jcrawford> rogeruiz: is it online where I could load the page?
[15:42:46] <Connor_> Try data('dateStart')
[15:43:17] <enjoycrf> $(window).bind('hashchange', function(e) {
[15:43:18] <enjoycrf> 	StockModule.LoadStock($.param.fragment());
[15:43:18] <enjoycrf> 	
[15:43:18] <enjoycrf> });
[15:43:21] <enjoycrf> WOW!
[15:43:30] <enjoycrf> can it be less code?
[15:43:33] <rogeruiz> Not at the current moment. I'll be online later tonight and I can put up a sample f the code. This issue is only happening in ie7
[15:43:34] <enjoycrf> exactly
[15:43:49] <jcrawford> undefined Connor_
[15:44:04] <rogeruiz> I'm currently on my phone. Thought maybe someone knew of some specific ie big
[15:44:08] <jcrawford> rogeruiz: oh sorry i missed the IE7 portion i won't be of any use lol
[15:44:09] <rogeruiz> Bug*
[15:44:23] <Connor_> Kai
[15:45:08] <rogeruiz> jcrawford: Thanks anyway then.
[15:46:30] <rogeruiz> I am running xp in parallels so maybe it's me. But our client testing is giving us the same bug
[15:46:30] <rogeruiz> Wishful thinking :(
[15:47:05] <enjoycrf> wait so how does one seet the hash via BBQ
[15:47:11] <enjoycrf> cause im still using
[15:47:20] <enjoycrf> window.location.hash = o.id;
[15:47:35] <jcrawford> Connor_: I have to run, can i catch up with you tomorrow on this?
[15:47:53] <Ricoshady> is there a jquery function for creating a JSON? I see them for parsing, but not encoding
[15:47:55] <Connor_> Sure, want my email just in casE?
[15:47:57] <nF{> how do I set my document to use jQuery
[15:48:04] <jcrawford> sure notice it to me please
[15:48:06] <nF{> I think it's being overrun by a different framework
[15:48:14] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: jQuery.bbq.pushState
[15:48:14] <jcrawford> i will shoot you an email before I go so you have my contact as well
[15:48:16] <nF{> console.log($==jQuery) is false
[15:50:03] <pizzach> guys, does addclass/removeclass work fine for allthe IEs?
[15:50:16] <pizzach> I think I remember if you do it manually, the knew styles don't show up automatically
[15:55:49] <Dave_Stein> pizzach ive never had an issue
[15:57:22] <nF{> is there anyway to specify current script is jQuery when prototype is loaded also
[15:58:35] <enjoycrf> ajpiano
[15:58:54] <enjoycrf> bbq pushstate wont let me use a simple hash like #123
[15:59:03] <enjoycrf> it wants me to do #id=123
[16:01:11] <ajpiano> you can just set hash manually then and use the hashchange stuff it gives you i guess
[16:02:08] <enjoycrf> weird that he didnt add that
[16:03:08] <ajpiano> the whole thing is built off there being fragment params instead of just a simple fragment
[16:03:26] <ajpiano> because having a fragment works fine until you're trying to use the hash for more than one thing at a time
[16:03:28] <enjoycrf> yeah well
[16:03:33] <enjoycrf> what a half of fragment?
[16:03:36] <enjoycrf> what is a
[16:03:40] <enjoycrf> exactly
[16:03:58] <enjoycrf> what is half of a name value pair?
[16:04:03] <enjoycrf> value
[16:04:28] <ajpiano> very astute
[16:04:38] <enjoycrf> wth is astute?
[16:04:50] <ajpiano> observant
[16:04:53] <ajpiano> hm
[16:04:58] <ajpiano> we might also be ... wrong
[16:05:03] <enjoycrf> i kno im a robot
[16:05:41] <ajpiano> yeah it seems to be pretty keen on the whole k/v pairs in the fragment if you set it
[16:06:30] <enjoycrf> actually let me test as string
[16:13:08] <saimon69> hello greetings
[16:13:24] <riscarrott> Does anyone know if the jQuery UI mouse widget might ever get rewritten using the jquery special event API?
[16:14:00] <saimon69> ok got a kinda problem. need to check/uncheck two checkboxes at the same time, and the only common thing between them is the value, how to handle it?
[16:14:05] <ajpiano> riscarrott: i'm not sure if the plan is to use the special events api, i know it's going to be refactored
[16:14:43] <enjoycrf> ok this is what hapens when its not a pair
[16:14:43] <enjoycrf> #test=
[16:14:51] <enjoycrf> $.bbq.pushState("test"); //only takes name value pairs
[16:15:07] <enjoycrf> i dun want no = lol
[16:15:33] <riscarrott> ajpiano: It would seem the jQuery way to use it? - I think the mouse widget extension is quite clever but I'm not sure it produces the most reusable API...
[16:16:01] <ajpiano> riscarrott: i think rworth is the one doing it, you should talk to him more about his plan when you can
[16:17:32] <riscarrott> okay, perhaps I'll drop him a message - any idea if the refactor has been started yet?
[16:19:10] <riscarrott> and what's the most appropriate way to get in touch with him would you say?
[16:21:10] <ajpiano> i'm not sure if it's started
[16:21:23] <ajpiano> i guess the best place to ask about mouse specific stuff would be http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/21320947/Mouse
[16:21:30] <ajpiano> you can comment there or try to catch him in #jqueryui-dev
[16:22:44] <rworth> riscarrott: yeah, you can comment on the wiki or post in developing jquery ui forum, or catch me in #jqueryui-dev
[16:25:17] <riscarrott> okay, I'll leave a comment on the wiki to get your thoughts, thanks.
[16:30:26] <gebbione> is this correct to change the left property of all the divs having a aClass css class? $("div.aClass").css('left', moveLeftTo);
[16:36:12] <gebbione> is anybody awake?
[16:36:21] <coldhead> on the whole planet?
[16:36:23] <coldhead> yes
[16:36:27] <coldhead> billions of people
[16:36:32] <enjoycrf> cold head
[16:36:47] <enjoycrf> cccccooooooooldddd
[16:36:48] <coldhead> hi enjy
[16:36:56] <enjoycrf> hhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaaddddddddd
[16:38:12] <gebbione> coldhead, prove it
[16:38:21] <gebbione> is this correct to change the left property of all the divs having a aClass css class? $("div.aClass").css('left', moveLeftTo);
[16:38:23] <gebbione> ?
[16:38:38] <coldhead> yes
[16:38:50] <coldhead> assuming moveLeftTo is sane
[16:39:00] <coldhead> that should work fine
[16:39:06] <gebbione> great thanks
[16:51:12] <gebbione> coldhead, is i want to select only the first one of the matching $("div.block") what can i do?
[16:51:21] <gebbione> coldhead, if i want to select only the first one of the matching $("div.block") what can i do?
[16:51:50] <coldhead> $('div.block:first')
[16:52:00] <gebbione> great t
[16:52:05] <gebbione> thanks :D
[16:52:22] <coldhead> you should read the jQuery selectors docs, there are a lot of awesome ones
[16:53:38] <gebbione> this does not look so extended as you say http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/
[17:02:58] <Kamakazi> will $(".classname:checked") get me all of the checkboxes of that class that are checked?
[17:04:27] <danieliser> any way to get the size of a hidden element? or a way to hide it so that its not visible but still renders a height and width.
[17:06:10] <ajpiano> danieliser: moving it offscreen (left: -9999px) and then showing it is one way
[17:07:29] <danieliser> ajpiano: example at sandbox.wizardinternetsolutions.com.. click a gallery image.. the first centers great.. then clicking the white boxes for next and prev i want to fix the transition from one image to the next.. ideas?
[17:07:41] <ajpiano> aw man
[17:07:50] <danieliser> images are different sizes..
[17:08:06] <ajpiano> "recommend a specific approach for a particular problem" is so different than "brainstorm solutions for how to make some effect work"
[17:08:07] <ajpiano> :pp
[17:08:39] <danieliser> lol.. no just need any ideas..when the images change they get recentered but its not very pretty..
[17:08:46] <kanzie> what is the best way to use closure-compilers with jQuery. Is it to take the unminified version of the code together with all my source and run through the compiler as one big chunk?
[17:10:16] <danieliser> ajpiano: sorry not trying to put you on the spot just trying to get more oppinions
[17:10:24] <Panora200> hey all!
[17:10:36] <Panora200> is it possible to get a dialog() without drawing it in the DOM?
[17:10:46] <ajpiano> danieliser: you could include the jquery ui position plugin standalone
[17:10:49] <ajpiano> and use it to well, position things
[17:10:55] <Panora200> or one has always to feed the DOM with the dialog html ?
[17:11:07] <ajpiano> Panora200: it is indeed possible
[17:11:13] <ajpiano> $("<div>").dialog();
[17:11:23] <ajpiano> it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new div
[17:11:33] <Panora200> ajpiano, lol
[17:11:53] <Panora200> ajpiano, doesnt that need a <div> in the DOM?
[17:12:05] <ajpiano> $("<div>") creating a new div
[17:12:20] <Panora200> oh. i thought it would be "searching for" a div
[17:12:22] <kanzie> Am I better off trying to group my functions into objects they refer to and use prototype. to extend or should I just leave my app as it is with all functions in the global scope and all variables in a made up namespace ie. var MyApplication = {}; MyApplication.foo = 'x'; etc.
[17:12:24] <Panora200> let me see..
[17:12:35] <Panora200> ajpiano, and how do i put some text in it?
[17:12:40] <Panora200> $('div').append?
[17:12:59] <ajpiano> $("<div>", {text: "foo"}) or $("<div>foo</div>") or $("<div>").text("foo")
[17:13:05] <ajpiano> Panora200: a new div is like an old div
[17:13:07] <ajpiano> in that it is a div
[17:13:39] <Panora200> *perfect*
[17:13:44] <Panora200> ajpiano, thank you so much
[17:13:47] <kanzie> and would this mean I get better output from services such as the google closure compiler
[17:14:24] <Panora200> ajpiano, oh, uh..... my dialog content is html...... isn't it drawn as such?
[17:14:31] <ajpiano> kanzie: generally minification tools work best when there aren't long scope chain lookups
[17:14:34] <Panora200> i mean, it actually starts with <html></html>
[17:14:34] <Panora200> ..
[17:14:39] <ajpiano> Panora200: that isn't good
[17:14:46] <Panora200> dialog() doesnt seem to render it...
[17:15:00] <Panora200> ajpiano, so what do you advise?
[17:15:03] <ajpiano> you can't put an <html> inside of the body
[17:15:07] <enjoycrf> background:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
[17:15:12] <enjoycrf> so sick
[17:15:15] <Panora200> ah ok, so it's just a matter of ripping it out?
[17:15:16] <ajpiano> Panora200: *not* using an entire html document?
[17:15:17] <Panora200> let me see
[17:15:18] <ajpiano> yep
[17:15:20] <enjoycrf> background:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
[17:15:21] <enjoycrf> try it
[17:15:23] <kanzie> ajpiano: meaning the way I have it now with  most of the code inside document.ready and all functions in the global scope is better than if I start creating objects and attach the functions to corresponding objects?
[17:15:31] <ajpiano> uh
[17:15:39] <Panora200> ajpiano, well, yes actually fetching html content from a remote location
[17:15:45] <ajpiano> having all your functions in the global scope sucks
[17:15:46] <Panora200> let me rip the protocol stuff
[17:16:21] <ajpiano> Panora200: you can do something like var newDiv = $("<div>");  $.get("someStuff.php", function(data) {  newDiv.html(data).dialog();  })
[17:16:22] <ajpiano> etc
[17:16:39] <kanzie> ajpiano: yeah Its iffy looking at it coming from a OO background but it is how its been developed. Im thinking of re-factoring it as such, but I need to find some advantages to be gained from it except just "nicer looking code".
[17:16:48] <Panora200> ah! *perfect*
[17:17:04] <kanzie> it will be quite a project so I need to be able and justify it
[17:17:06] <ajpiano> kanzie: you should also be aware that jQuery itself won't run through CC with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS
[17:17:38] <ajpiano> kanzie: not having your entire app leak every single function into the global namespace is its own reward
[17:17:41] <kanzie> ajpiano: ah, since my code rely on jQ for pretty much everything it does then I won't see much gain from any of the CC then?
[17:17:48] <Panora200> ajpiano, you're a genius mate :D
[17:17:48] <ajpiano> also... users not being able to like... publicly invoke your entire application logic is nice
[17:17:59] <ajpiano> kanzie: that's not what i'm saying at all
[17:18:15] <ajpiano> i'm saying that the jQuery library file itself cannot be run through CC with a partricular mode on at all
[17:18:30] <kanzie> ajpiano: but if you can't have CC make shorthands for the functions then most calls in my code will rely on the long names etc.
[17:19:18] <ajpiano> thats why it's good to have local references for long property lookups
[17:19:30] <ajpiano> var localthing = foo.bar.baz.bang.bat;
[17:19:35] <ajpiano> and then use localthing
[17:19:39] <kanzie> ajpiano: so you recommend I try to group functions into objects that I do prototype on and create a place all these objects under a made-up namespace?
[17:19:55] <ajpiano> and CC or any other minifier would be able to change that var to something else when minifying
[17:20:07] <ajpiano> kanzie: i don't know what "do prototype on" means but yet
[17:20:08] <ajpiano> yes
[17:20:18] <ajpiano> you should organize your code and your app should all live inside of one top level namespace
[17:20:40] <ajpiano> now, that doesn't mean that within your app, every piece of code is like MYAPP.module.whatever.watever
[17:20:48] <ajpiano> it just means that that's where it lives
[17:20:58] <kanzie> var Alarm = function(); Alarm.prototype.raiseAlarm = function(x) { do y };
[17:21:04] <kanzie> ajpiano: something like that
[17:21:12] <ajpiano> i guess
[17:21:26] <ajpiano> having reusable classes and avoiding the global scope are not necessarily interrelated
[17:21:34] <ajpiano> but they aren't... not interrelated
[17:21:37] <kanzie> and I place Alarm under var MyNamespace = {};
[17:21:48] <ajpiano> yeah
[17:22:08] <kanzie> but then I would get a lot of MyNamespace.Alarm.raiseAlarm(x); calls
[17:22:15] <ajpiano> yeah you don't want that at all
[17:22:22] <kborchers> ajpiano: gnarf and i kicked some popup/menu ass today ... mostly just menu though (meaning a bunch of my code :p )
[17:22:22] <bot-t> (2 hours 10 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell kborchers that works just great :) thanks
[17:22:24] <kanzie> do I make a shorthand for MyNamespace
[17:22:52] <kanzie> like var mm = MyNamespace; and call mm.Alarm.raiseAlarm(x)l
[17:23:18] <ajpiano> what you really want is like var myNamespace = {};  myNamespace.module = (function() { function Alarm(){};  Alarm.prototype.whatever = fn;  new Alarm();   })(); etc
[17:23:24] <Panora200> ajpiano, is it possible that the dialog wraps the text?
[17:23:27] <ajpiano> so that like, there are private small chunks of functionality
[17:23:34] <Panora200> it has put a hscroll in there
[17:23:36] <ajpiano> that aren't necessarily exposed on the global object
[17:24:21] <kanzie> ok, but how do I call "whatever()" then
[17:25:38] <ajpiano> var thing = new Alarm();  thing.whatever();
[17:25:44] <kborchers> ajpiano: does that app you're building need to support IE6?
[17:25:49] <ajpiano> kborchers: no
[17:26:01] <ajpiano> its just a prototype
[17:26:08] <ajpiano> kborchers: thanks a lot for bangin that out
[17:26:15] <ajpiano> again :)
[17:26:15] <kborchers> ok, cool. there's an issue with IE6 and menus inside of popups
[17:26:18] <kanzie> and where do I store private vars related to Alarm-objectâ¦ do I put them in the Alarm() {} construct like this.foo ='bar';
[17:26:19] <Panora200> ajpiano,  is it possible that the dialog wraps the text?
[17:26:19] <kborchers> no prob
[17:26:23] <coldhead> gebbione: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[17:26:28] <Panora200> ajpiano, i don't find any option for that.. :S
[17:26:36] <ajpiano> Panora200: i don't know what you mean, "wraps the text"
[17:26:49] <Panora200> break the text in multiple lines
[17:27:02] <kborchers> er menus as popups is what i meant. the submenus are hidden. about to work on that now
[17:27:09] <ajpiano> the contents of the dialog would do whatever they would do if they were in a container the size of the dialog
[17:27:20] <ajpiano> you have to use css or the dialog size options to control the dialog's dimensions
[17:27:27] <danzik17> Not specifically jQuery related, but http://jsperf.com/ridiculous-json-perf-case/3 - can anyone explain that behavior?  It's killin me :(
[17:27:35] <danzik17> kanzie: You should give this a read: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[17:27:42] <kanzie> danzik17: thanks
[17:27:45] <Panora200> ajpiano, yeah i've set a width
[17:28:03] <ajpiano> danzik17: thanks for droppin that link
[17:28:07] <Panora200> ajpiano, but it doesn't seem to break the text,.... but I see what you mean
[17:28:08] <ajpiano> kanzie:  thats what i was explaining :)
[17:28:09] <kanzie> need something to explain those self-executing methods that you use to set scopeâ¦ not sure I fully get the structure yet
[17:28:37] <kanzie> ajpiano: yeah totally, no I know this is what I need. Im just not 100% on the details of how to set it up and I need to get that before starting the re-factoring
[17:28:47] <kanzie> it will help documentation as well so I feel good about this
[17:28:52] <ajpiano> kanzie: read about the module pattern
[17:28:55] <ajpiano> however you can
[17:29:05] <kanzie> ajpiano: yep, Im reading the link now
[17:29:28] <kanzie> thanks for the help
[17:29:43] <kanzie> but first, some climbingâ¦ :-)
[17:30:00] <ajpiano> danzik17: i have *no idea* why that would be the case
[17:30:06] <ajpiano> ask aruss
[17:30:08] <ajpiano> lol
[17:30:42] <ajpiano> http://twitter.com/#!/slightlylate
[17:30:43] <socialhapy> â Tweet from slightlylate: @joehewitt canonical formats will emerge, particularly if we spec a &lt;datasource&gt; to grok a default few â http://bit.ly/oRisXz
[17:33:23] <danzik17> ajpiano: I know, I spent a crapload of time on it, then just resigned myself to browser checking chrome and running that hack =P  I could feature detect it, but takes too long to just run the test
[17:33:41] <ajpiano> what would you even be feature detecting for?
[17:34:28] <danzik17> it's a significant difference enough where you could just use new Date() to detect if the "ridiculous" mode is worth running
[17:34:45] <danzik17> Timewise, that takes about 400ms - non-optimized, 1600ms
[17:34:55] <johnline> having trouble fixing a bug with tabs and galleria in firefox and chrome http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/design/
[17:35:34] <johnline> the slideshows on the secondary tabs dont function, interacting with them breaks the functionality of the first tab's slideshow too
[17:36:14] <danzik17> That said, I may not implement it period - to actually encounter that edge case, someone would have to be doing something that would be me (and quite a lot of other people at my company) want to punch them in the face =P
[17:36:24] <ajpiano> danzik17: unless you're doing masssssssssssive datasets and in chrome only, it seems like an absurd thing to try and implement
[17:36:44] <fede_arg> hi
[17:36:57] <ajpiano> danzik17: if the speed at which chrome sorts an array in place is your application bottleneck
[17:37:00] <ajpiano> you are a fuckin great coder
[17:37:05] <ajpiano> :)
[17:37:20] <danzik17> ajpiano: For this specific feature it is =P
[17:41:46] <Dave_Stein> what are you guys talking about?
[17:41:54] <Dave_Stein> just hopped back in
[17:43:24] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein http://jsperf.com/ridiculous-json-perf-case/3
[17:45:00] <Dave_Stein> ha i guess they cache something once you access it ?
[17:45:28] <Dave_Stein> and if you dont access it, they have to do wahtever they did before + sorting
[17:45:31] <Dave_Stein> that's my wild guess
[17:45:35] <Dave_Stein> that is def funny tho
[17:46:05] <paul_irish> danzik17: bro
[17:46:07] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: Can't be - that first case always happens unless you do the workaround
[17:46:12] <paul_irish> you on twitter?
[17:46:24] <danzik17> paul_irish: for the first time in about 2 years =P
[17:46:44] <johnline> twitter is 2 years olds?
[17:46:45] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's what i mean, your workaroudn is accessing the object after definition so they must do soemthing internally
[17:46:56] <chovy> I saw an oddity in chrome today.
[17:47:08] <Dave_Stein> but man is that screwed - i just looked on FF and its 12,475 to 4,613
[17:47:19] <chovy> appears that setInterval() builds up a queue when the tab is not in focus.
[17:47:20] <Dave_Stein> it makes sense that "Normal" should be faster
[17:47:23] <danzik17> johnline: No idea, point is I signed up a long, long time ago and never logged back in
[17:47:32] <imsky> fiiiiind yourself
[17:47:32] <bot-t> (21 hours 50 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky why is every single brazilian league of legends player fucking atrocious at the game. :(
[17:47:34] <Dave_Stein> but man that's a lot faster in general
[17:47:46] <johnline> lol i never understood the attraction of it
[17:47:46] <chovy> then when you refocus the tab, all the events in the queue fire.
[17:47:56] <abjorn> it's true imsky
[17:47:56] <bot-t> (8 secs ago) <imsky> tell abjorn hahaha i saw that chart you posted
[17:47:57] <abjorn> they are
[17:48:01] <Dave_Stein> that is interesting chovy
[17:48:11] <Dave_Stein> chovy, is that posted anywhere?
[17:48:16] <imsky> what up abjorn you sleazy bitch
[17:48:21] <abjorn> was just playing LoL
[17:48:25] <abjorn> trying the new beta game mode
[17:48:29] <abjorn> no brazilians!
[17:48:34] <ajpiano> chovy: i think thats some new thing
[17:48:35] <imsky> racist
[17:48:37] <Dave_Stein> abjorn how do you make bott tell peple things?
[17:48:43] <ajpiano> that setInterval is throttled to once every 1000ms
[17:48:46] <paul_irish> chovy: setInterval is clamped to 1000ms when in a bg tag
[17:48:49] <abjorn> bot-t: tell Dave_Stein he should figure it out
[17:48:49] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:48:50] <ajpiano> blam
[17:49:07] <paul_irish> i added this to the setInterval (or setTimeout) mdc page
[17:49:19] <chovy> paul_irish: yeah, that's what I was thinking, but they queue up I guess.
[17:49:26] <chovy> I think I can send a link
[17:49:58] <paul_irish> queue up....
[17:50:09] <chovy> http://www.chegg.com/jobs/
[17:50:11] <abjorn> QUEUE UP
[17:50:12] <bot-t> (50 secs ago) <Dave_Stein> tell abjorn whatever man
[17:50:15] <paul_irish> setInterval is kind of like a queue....
[17:50:16] <abjorn> lol
[17:50:21] <imsky> ROLL OUT
[17:51:00] <chovy> open a new tab, and go to Yahoo.com or something. Then just wait about 2-3 minutes, then go back to the tab w/ Chegg Jobs, and watch the slideshow -- it starts processing them differently for a few seconds, then the queue clears.
[17:51:44] <Dave_Stein> so instead of throttling to once a second, it does it once a second and then runs all thel eftovers when you return?
[17:51:49] <ajpiano> i'm going to espn.com, i hope this works
[17:51:53] <Dave_Stein> or am i mis-understanding?
[17:51:55] <chovy> Dave_Stein: that's what I'm seeing.
[17:52:06] <paul_irish> chovy: are you using jquery for the timers
[17:52:18] <Dave_Stein> chovy looks like the "is it a bug or a feature" game
[17:52:23] <chovy> not sure.
[17:52:30] <abjorn> yaaaayy, imsky, they rewrote the chat program at work and now it isn't completely awful :D
[17:52:40] <imsky> by they do you mean you?
[17:52:43] <Dave_Stein> http://www.spatiallyrelevant.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/bug-feature.jpg
[17:52:44] <abjorn> I wish
[17:52:45] <ajpiano> chovy: upgrade to jquery 1.6.3
[17:52:49] <ajpiano> i mean 1.6.4
[17:52:51] <abjorn> I didn't get the job, someone else did
[17:52:56] <abjorn> https://chat.hostgator.com:5000/js/in_chat.js
[17:52:57] <imsky> abjorn: lolol, that's sweet anyway
[17:53:06] <imsky> oh shit https on that .js
[17:53:11] <imsky> NEVER CACHE
[17:53:14] <abjorn> rofl
[17:53:19] <paul_irish> chovy: waht ajpiano said
[17:53:19] <chovy> Dave_Stein: it could totally be a bug, it just only happens in Chrome. And I was reading about chrome and background tabs yesterday w/ setTimeout
[17:53:29] <abjorn> caching? who needs caching?!
[17:53:37] <Dave_Stein> caching is for geeks and i'm not a geek
[17:53:41] <paul_irish> requestAnimationFrame in the wrong hands.
[17:53:41] <abjorn> rite?
[17:53:44] <Dave_Stein> i'm a maverick
[17:53:47] <ajpiano> chovy: ur doin some jquery animtions in a setInterval loop
[17:53:49] <ajpiano> ?
[17:53:59] <imsky> abjorn: not me wtf is that shit
[17:54:02] <chovy> ajpiano: i have to look. I didn't write it.
[17:54:08] <imsky> MY STATIC FILES ARE ENCRYPTED ALL THE TIME
[17:54:13] <ajpiano> chovy: in that case just try upgrade to 1.6.4 first
[17:54:14] <ajpiano> :)
[17:54:17] <ajpiano> and see if behaviour persists
[17:54:38] <Dave_Stein> ugh i just moved to 1.6.2... now i gotta upgrade on a zillion sites again :(
[17:54:44] <frio_> quick q; I have an object defined (var Obj = function() {}; Obj.prototype.on_success = function() {}), and it appears jQuery is supplanting the "this" inside the object
[17:54:51] <chovy> Dave_Stein: exactly :)
[17:54:55] <abjorn> They're still using setInterval for the chat system tho, imsky >.>
[17:54:58] <Dave_Stein> on my list of todos, make a js library that all my sites build from.. almost there!
[17:55:00] <imsky> abjorn: this new source has a lot less to make fun of :\
[17:55:02] <ajpiano> frio_: use see ?proxy
[17:55:02] <chovy> can't they just give us a jquery-latest.cdn
[17:55:02] <bot-t> frio_, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[17:55:12] <ajpiano> chovy: there is that
[17:55:15] <abjorn> imsky: But this time around they have the sense to use clearInterval
[17:55:25] <frio_> so when I do this.templates.whatever from within the on_success call, it's referring to jQuery rather than the object
[17:55:26] <ajpiano> chovy: but then you get upgrades your jqueries before your app is maybe ready for these jquery
[17:55:27] <chovy> i think google jsapis does that with /1/
[17:55:27] <imsky> if it ain't ben alman
[17:55:30] <imsky> it ain't interval
[17:55:33] <abjorn> ^
[17:55:37] <frio_> OK thanks for the ref ajpiano, will look at that now :)
[17:55:39] <chovy> ajpiano: yeah, that's one drawback
[17:55:45] <abjorn> is ben alman a meme yet?
[17:55:48] <chovy> wrap everything in try catch heh
[17:55:54] <ajpiano> because these jquery don't fright back
[17:56:00] <imsky> abjorn: let's work super hard this year to make it one
[17:56:06] <imsky> ajpiano: you a goon?
[17:56:06] <abjorn> it's a plan
[17:56:21] <imsky> FIIIIIND YOURSELF
[17:56:58] <imsky> abjorn: for (var i = 0; i < response['msgs'].length; i++) {
[17:56:59] <imsky> >:|
[17:57:16] <abjorn> lol
[17:58:16] <abjorn> I remember I had been hired to debug some js for a company awhile back and every single for loop had this
[17:58:16] <abjorn> // this makes the for loop go faster
[17:58:16] <abjorn> var len = someArray.length;
[17:58:16] <abjorn> for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
[17:58:24] <abjorn> that same comment
[17:58:25] <abjorn> everywhere
[17:58:31] <Dave_Stein> i actually laughed at that one
[17:58:33] <imsky> abjorn: $("#panic-tooltip").one('click', function(){
[17:58:36] <imsky> what's this lovely thing?
[17:58:41] <abjorn> fuck if i know
[17:59:04] <abjorn> psh you kiddin me, i never use the front end of this thing
[17:59:08] <imsky> haha
[17:59:11] <abjorn> i use some shitty perl application on our work machines
[17:59:12] <imsky> you have your own client
[17:59:20] <imsky> the BEN ALMAN 3000
[17:59:28] <abjorn> it locks up like 10 times a day
[17:59:40] <imsky> lol
[18:00:02] <abjorn> although that has more to do with the fact that we use a netboot that has 50+ people on it at any given time
[18:00:09] <abjorn> actually, more like 100+
[18:00:25] <abjorn> the whole thing locks up at least once a day
[18:00:35] <imsky> how is that even
[18:00:38] <imsky> acceptable
[18:00:44] <abjorn> That's my thought
[18:00:48] <Dave_Stein> #lost
[18:00:49] <imsky> i think that's like the standard for third-world offshore shit
[18:00:54] <abjorn> I mean, when it locks up it usually only does it for like
[18:00:55] <imsky> but in america, our shit is bug-free
[18:00:57] <abjorn> 20-30 seconds
[18:00:59] <chovy> i think it has to do with recursion.
[18:01:00] <abjorn> but every few weeks or so
[18:01:15] <chovy> and all the setTimeouts building up
[18:01:18] <abjorn> the managers freak out because it locks up so hard you can't do anything for like 20-30 minutes
[18:02:15] <abjorn> and don't get me started on the day the network on one of our server farms went out. Suddenly 10,000+ people in chat, 1,000 calls. Everything broke lol
[18:02:27] <imsky> my god
[18:02:50] <abjorn> To put it in perspective, busy for us is 180 chats and 70ish calls
[18:02:58] <imsky> well you know
[18:03:03] <imsky> the solution to all that is simple
[18:03:10] <imsky> just attach a chatbot to the front end
[18:03:11] <abjorn> don't let the network go out?
[18:03:14] <abjorn> rofl
[18:03:20] <imsky> and run it on the front-end
[18:03:26] <imsky> so no server load ever happens
[18:03:47] <frio_> ajpiano: excellent, that worked, thankyou :)
[18:03:47] <abjorn> our chat system front-end isn't equipped to handle when our system goes down either, so all the customers see is a failed connection
[18:03:51] <imsky> just imagine grandma auntpaw typing away in duluth, minnesota
[18:04:00] <imsky> talking to an automaton in blissful ignorance
[18:04:12] <Dave_Stein> Hello Dave, I am afraid, Stop it.
[18:04:12] <abjorn> I've had customers who thought I was a bot
[18:04:13] <imsky> abjorn: that's the advantage of a frontend chatbot, it's always on :D
[18:04:17] <frio_> why is it that jQuery replaces "this" on object functions it's calling though?
[18:04:29] <imsky> frio_: wat lol
[18:04:36] <abjorn> Like event callbacks?
[18:04:37] <imsky> abjorn: how did they get confused
[18:04:41] <imsky> were you too formal
[18:04:41] <Dave_Stein> do you mean like {}.each ?
[18:04:44] <abjorn> dunno
[18:04:47] <abjorn> well we kinda need to be
[18:04:47] <abjorn> ish
[18:04:51] <frio_> hang on a sec, ill pastebin
[18:04:53] <abjorn> We get some leeway but still
[18:04:57] <imsky> abjorn: don't you have scripts?
[18:05:03] <abjorn> sort of
[18:05:05] <ajpiano> frio_: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide28
[18:05:21] <ajpiano> frio_: it does it because that's how it's always done it and it's not unreasonable
[18:05:23] <imsky> lol you failed the turing test :(
[18:05:26] <abjorn> I mean, we don't have a script to follow for every situation or anything, but we have "QA Approved" responses for certain things
[18:05:28] <ajpiano> you just have to know that it does it and how to combat it
[18:05:49] <frio_> it's not $(this) though, it's just this.
[18:05:51] <frio_> hang on :)
[18:05:53] <abjorn> most of them are for things we can't really talk about, like when someone asks how we secure our servers
[18:06:07] <imsky> abjorn: tell them "we store backups through a trojan horse on your computer"
[18:06:13] <abjorn> all we can say is we protect DDOS and have a large set of mod_sec rules
[18:06:17] <abjorn> *protect against
[18:06:26] <ajpiano> frio_: when you put a wig on an organe, it's still an orange
[18:06:36] <frio_> http://pastebin.com/eZgLp9QX
[18:06:36] <abjorn> what's an orange
[18:06:43] <abjorn> *organe
[18:06:44] <imsky> wig on orange:    8(   )
[18:06:46] <abjorn> wow
[18:06:46] <Dave_Stein> abjorn, what company are you talkin about?
[18:06:49] <frio_> where now im using proxy, before it was the same as on_error
[18:06:55] <imsky> organe?
[18:06:57] <abjorn> I can't even misspell purposefully
[18:07:02] <frio_> referring to this.templates.success in the on_success function would fail
[18:07:04] <abjorn> HostGator
[18:07:06] <imsky> FIIIIIIND YOURSELF
[18:07:08] <frio_> because "this" was a jQuery obejct
[18:07:17] <imsky> frio_: wut
[18:07:19] <frio_> so it's like jQuery wraps the on_success call
[18:07:26] <ajpiano> frio_: you can use context: this
[18:07:29] <ajpiano> when you're doing ajax
[18:07:38] <ajpiano> and it sets the scope of all the ajax callbacks
[18:07:41] <ajpiano> error, success, etc.
[18:08:08] <frio_> ok ajpiano
[18:08:19] <frio_> im guessing i just dont understand javascript objects very well
[18:08:20] <Dave_Stein> ah do you know why you had such an explosion that day?
[18:08:36] <abjorn> which day, the day we had 10,000 people in support chat suddenly?
[18:08:39] <frio_> but it seemed odd to me
[18:08:45] <Dave_Stein> yeah :)
[18:08:52] <abjorn> yeah, server farm network outage
[18:08:59] <Dave_Stein> lol
[18:09:18] <danzik17> frio_: Generally this === window which is pretty pointless, so jQuery makes it useful (at least that's what I figure)
[18:09:30] <imsky> generally, this !== window
[18:09:30] <imsky> wtf
[18:09:33] <abjorn> at least thats all i can tell you
[18:09:39] <abjorn> (that's all I know, but even if I did)
[18:09:50] <imsky> abjorn: god damn you're secretive
[18:09:58] <frio_> danzik17: in an object prototype though, wouldn't "this" refer to the object?
[18:10:00] <danzik17> imsky: Other than constructors, when does it not?  (Not counting .call or .apply here)
[18:10:01] <Dave_Stein> inside a random function this is the window
[18:10:02] <abjorn> honestly I know very little that I could tell you that I'm not allowed to
[18:10:03] <abjorn> lol
[18:10:07] <imsky> danzik17: tons of other places
[18:10:09] <frio_> the same way it would in java, or python's self, etc.
[18:10:19] <imsky> frio_: yes you're exactly correct
[18:10:30] <imsky> bitches talking about this like they know it
[18:10:42] <Dave_Stein> the only time i really use $.proxy is on callbacks of event handlers cause i can just use event.target anywho in most cases
[18:10:51] <Dave_Stein> the rest of the time jquery does a fine job of putting this to better use
[18:10:51] <frio_> :p
[18:11:18] <abjorn> I've never really needed to $.proxy a callback
[18:11:23] <ajpiano> lol
[18:11:35] <Dave_Stein> do you do an anonymous function with "self" scoped outside it?
[18:11:37] <abjorn> woah chrome updated
[18:11:37] <frio_> then imsky, in http://pastebin.com/eZgLp9QX line 20, why does "this" refer to jQuery, rather than the object? (at least, without the proxy call)
[18:11:40] <abjorn> the home screen changed
[18:11:48] <imsky> abjorn: you're slow bud
[18:11:50] <frio_> im more than willing to look at my design again if it's retarded
[18:11:51] <imsky> it's been updated a while now
[18:11:53] <abjorn> 15 beta!
[18:11:56] <imsky> 16 son
[18:11:58] <frio_> i'm not really a javascript programmer :)
[18:12:05] <abjorn> I literally just had chrome open lol
[18:12:06] <abjorn> then closed it
[18:12:08] <Dave_Stein> im on 14
[18:12:11] <abjorn> then opened it again
[18:12:20] <imsky> welcome to delta updates
[18:12:28] <abjorn> psh whatever, i dont go for the dev build
[18:12:30] <imsky> here's a fun tip
[18:12:32] <abjorn> ive had too many issues with it
[18:12:45] <imsky> windows can patch software that hasn't been installed yet
[18:12:49] <imsky> due to some shit inside function calls
[18:12:55] <imsky> so when you install it, it's already patched
[18:13:00] <imsky> that's chromelicious
[18:13:20] <abjorn> i...c
[18:13:22] <imsky> ye ye
[18:13:39] * abjorn wiggles
[18:13:43] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano sending off http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide29 to my dev etam haha
[18:13:46] * imsky wiggles horde
[18:13:57] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: awesome :)
[18:14:22] <frio_> ah... unless calling "this.x" actually translates to a static-style call of Query.x, in which case, "this" would be nonsensical and jQuery replaces it.  that'd make sense
[18:14:36] <frio_> (where Query != jQuery, but the name of my stupid object)
[18:14:38] <abjorn> oh yeah
[18:14:39] <abjorn> imsky
[18:14:40] <imsky> frio_: ok wtf is that code
[18:14:41] <abjorn> i found out
[18:14:47] <abjorn> we have a blind perl programmer at work
[18:14:56] <imsky> abjorn: oh lawd
[18:14:56] <ajpiano> frio_: jQuery doesn't magically just make a judgment call as to whter or not to do it
[18:15:01] <frio_> *sigh* i was worried thatd be the reaction imsky
[18:15:13] <ajpiano> frio_: are you sure that 'this' is the instance of the Query when you *call* ajax and pass it to $.proxy
[18:15:22] <ajpiano> frio_: it looks pretty reasonable to me
[18:15:24] <imsky> frio_: i think you're trying super hard to make it into a legit app...where it just needs to be a simple script
[18:15:27] <abjorn> yeah its kinda ridic, imsky
[18:15:33] <ajpiano> bros
[18:15:40] <Dave_Stein> i looked at the paste and blinked a bit and then went away
[18:15:40] <abjorn> Of all languages to program while blind...perl?
[18:15:43] <imsky> abjorn: how did he learn it
[18:15:44] <ajpiano> can you stop hating on this guy for wanting an object oriented request wrapper
[18:15:49] <ajpiano> :)
[18:15:51] <imsky> ajpiano: i love my RAM
[18:15:54] <imsky> do you love your RAM?
[18:15:54] <frio_> imsky: i need to do about 10 different queries, all to slightly different URLs that match the same general style
[18:16:00] <abjorn> I was saying ridic to something completely different ajpiano
[18:16:03] <Dave_Stein> abjorn that's really your question about that?
[18:16:05] <imsky> frio_: so write a function
[18:16:13] <abjorn> yes, dave, yes it is
[18:16:16] <Dave_Stein> abjorn how the oeff do you program blind haha that must suck
[18:16:23] <abjorn> I can't imagine
[18:16:23] <abjorn> lol
[18:16:24] <frio_> function doesn't quite fit imsky; they all need context
[18:16:32] <imsky> frio_: O_o
[18:16:33] <frio_> and i wasn't aware jQuery had a specific way of passing context to functions
[18:16:42] <imsky> just out of curiosity
[18:16:47] <imsky> how do you call this thing, two times
[18:16:53] <ajpiano> imsky: you need to get a way better sense of like, what actually causes bloat beofre you start getting all high and mighty like he's trying to rebuild the pyramid at giza on every call
[18:17:06] <imsky> ajpiano: are you condescending right now
[18:17:10] <ajpiano> yep
[18:17:11] <Dave_Stein> brb dont miss me too much
[18:17:16] <abjorn> sir pls my websights
[18:17:19] <imsky> ajpiano: y u do it? :'(
[18:17:20] <abjorn> i will dave
[18:17:21] <abjorn> i will

[18:17:47] <frio_> the templates are just dummies atm; i need to get things working before i make it look pretty
[18:17:52] <abjorn> jaboqwery
[18:17:58] <imsky> yes yes!
[18:18:08] <imsky> a jaboqwery story
[18:18:56] <abjorn> sir pls my websights
[18:18:58] <abjorn> u fix, i wait
[18:19:06] <imsky> lol sir pls, i pay 5 dollars
[18:19:21] <frio_> ajpiano: re: "this" meaning something different in the get call
[18:19:27] <frio_> i think you've just hit the nail on the head
[18:19:36] <imsky> frio_: well if you're still confused about this, i suppose you should have defined it before $.ajax and then passed it in
[18:19:50] <Dave_Stein> why are we still talking about this
[18:19:52] <Dave_Stein> ahhhh
[18:19:52] <imsky> although it looks like you're building way too much shit
[18:20:07] <frio_> no doubt imsky, im just surprised that "this" doesn't refer to the object itself by default, like in other languages
[18:20:13] <frio_> the fact it can be replaced is strange to me
[18:20:20] <frio_> and sorry for taking your time up; it's working now, i just don
[18:20:23] <imsky> frio_: you're in a different scope, not strange at all
[18:20:24] <Dave_Stein> it's not strange in JS or apply and call woudln't exist
[18:20:39] <frio_> (or didn't) understand why it'd not be what i expected
[18:20:43] <Dave_Stein> jquery changes it to things that make sense
[18:20:51] <imsky> well you get off scot-free because you're not a js programmer, frio_
[18:20:54] <imsky> but if you were...
[18:20:57] <imsky> >:|
[18:20:59] <frio_> hah :p
[18:21:00] <Dave_Stein> although i dont understand why jquery chose to make it the dom node vs a jquery object dpeending on like $.fn vs $.click
[18:21:01] <ajpiano> frio_: typically when i do a request wrapper, i end up with something more like .... function request( options ) { return $.ajax( $.extend( DEFAULTS, options) );   }
[18:21:14] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano, any ideas on that one?
[18:21:23] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: it's better to let you $(this) it than create the jquery object no matter what
[18:21:23] <frio_> ok, cheers ajpiano
[18:21:26] <ajpiano> and then let it go to waste
[18:21:43] <Dave_Stein> so shouldnt $.fn plugins do the same thing?
[18:21:47] <imsky> abjorn: anyone ever ask you to fix websights?
[18:21:52] <frio_> if next, you guys could fix google so "jQuery this" was a meaningful search, i'd apprecate it
[18:21:53] <abjorn> yes
[18:21:54] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: people can do anything they want
[18:21:57] <abjorn> every day
[18:22:00] <imsky> hahaha
[18:22:01] <frio_> and pls remember your TPS cover sheets on all future memos
[18:22:06] <Dave_Stein> i think im scrambled oh no
[18:22:15] <abjorn> we get a lot of foreign customers
[18:22:20] <imsky> frio_: watch some javascript talks by crockford and paul irish first ;)
[18:22:28] <abjorn> it's worse during night/graveyard shifts, but we get it plenty on day shift too
[18:22:40] <frio_> will slap that in my todo imsky :)
[18:22:43] <frio_> is "eloquent javascript
[18:22:47] <frio_> " a decent book?
[18:22:55] <imsky> sure, but books are kinda...not that great
[18:22:55] <ajpiano> yes
[18:22:58] <frio_> (FUCK i hate this shithouse work keyboard and it's stupidly large return key)
[18:23:00] <kborchers> frio_: yes, very good
[18:23:03] <ajpiano> its our see ?101
[18:23:03] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[18:23:21] <abjorn> books r gud imsky
[18:23:23] <frio_> excellent, thanks
[18:23:26] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/eGsDd/ what i mean is, I always thought both cases shuold spit DOM node
[18:23:30] <imsky> frio_: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/ this will jog your brain a bit more than a 101 book
[18:23:35] <abjorn> books are how I learned HTML 4 back in 2000!
[18:23:38] <imsky> abjorn: i no rite, i read like 2 a week :(
[18:23:45] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano; and i always thought it was weird that one case is jQuery and other isn't since what you said makes perfect sense and means it shuold alawys be dom
[18:23:50] <abjorn> and by books i meant one really, really large book
[18:23:58] <imsky> the phonebook?
[18:24:01] <abjorn> all the html was written in uppercase
[18:24:07] <abjorn> <HTML>
[18:24:12] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein, those aren't logically equivalent things
[18:24:14] <imsky> <HTML><BODY></BODY><FUCKYOU></HTML>
[18:24:18] <frio_> painful memories abjorn
[18:24:19] <abjorn> ^
[18:24:31] <frio_> thanks for the link imsky, ill look at that too
[18:24:35] <imsky> np bud
[18:24:42] <abjorn> the book also came with a disc that had mosiac on it
[18:24:47] <imsky> oh lawd
[18:24:49] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: when defining a method on jquery prototype, the point is to... get the collection and do stuff to it
[18:24:57] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i guess the argument is $.fn is made to be chained all the time, based on common framework of jquery whereas a click is just a one-off callback
[18:25:00] <abjorn> I got the book at Half Price Books lol
[18:25:01] <ajpiano> it already *is* a jquery
[18:25:08] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:25:16] <Dave_Stein> also i dont think framework was the right word there but you know what i mean
[18:25:31] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: in other words, the click handler is sort of like being $.fn.foo = function() {   return this.each(function() { //HERE  }); }
[18:25:32] <ajpiano> already
[18:25:43] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:25:44] <ajpiano> yeah i have way beter things to do with my time than argue framework vs library semantics
[18:25:52] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:25:53] <ajpiano> :)
[18:26:01] <ajpiano> like PLAY SCRABBLE
[18:26:04] <Dave_Stein> right so .bind and click always returns the collection
[18:26:05] <Dave_Stein> oh man
[18:26:08] <ajpiano> i mean ... work
[18:26:08] <Dave_Stein> ill crush you on words with friends
[18:26:11] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:26:18] <Dave_Stein> Shawazi5 - add me if you have it
[18:26:22] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: challenge me
[18:26:23] <Dave_Stein> i'm addicted
[18:26:24] <ajpiano> i'm over the games limit
[18:26:27] <Dave_Stein> lol

[18:26:58] <Dave_Stein> i just said "im gonna play words with friends with a jquery developer" and my front end dev goes "i cant believe how much of a nerd you are"
[18:26:59] <Dave_Stein> lol
[18:27:12] <ajpiano> haha
[18:27:29] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: i also play on http://isc.ro
[18:27:36] <ajpiano> which is the real underground realness
[18:27:43] <ajpiano> for hardcore timed scrabblenesses
[18:27:55] <Dave_Stein> thats insane
[18:27:58] <ajpiano> yea

[18:28:19] <Dave_Stein> its okay i just like to play people i know anywho i used to play random peopel but its not as fun
[18:28:37] <ajpiano> abjorn: srabble is for real men ... and wome
[18:28:42] <ajpiano> all these pretenders are just... pretenders
[18:28:49] <ajpiano> wordsquared is really baller though
[18:28:49] <imsky> calling attention to nerdery means you're not a nerd
[18:28:51] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano youre officially challenged and i started with a sucky word so make the msot of it haha
[18:28:55] <abjorn> eloquently spoken, ajpiano

[18:31:04] <Dave_Stein> not again!!!! NOOOOO
[18:31:12] <abjorn> wordsquared doesn't accept tiamat as a word :(
[18:31:13] <imsky> ?js parseFloat((.1+.2).toFixed(2))
[18:31:14] <bot-t> imsky: 0.3
[18:31:19] <imsky> Dave_Stein: watch and learn
[18:31:24] <Dave_Stein> lol
[18:31:28] <Dave_Stein> wtfjs.com <3
[18:31:44] <Dave_Stein> man i haven't gone there in a while
[18:31:48] <ajpiano> wordsquared has gotten so much better since when they made it
[18:31:54] <Aquaguy> hey there
[18:31:54] <abjorn> ?js 0.01+0.02
[18:31:54] <bot-t> abjorn: 0.03
[18:31:58] <abjorn> thats the real mind fuck
[18:32:00] <Dave_Stein> ?js typeof NaN
[18:32:01] <bot-t> Dave_Stein: "number"
[18:32:13] <abjorn> ajpiano: yeah it has
[18:32:18] <Dave_Stein> JS is like a politician: hypocritical
[18:32:22] <ajpiano> remember when it was scrabb.ly
[18:32:22] <abjorn> its all fancy and wooden now
[18:32:23] <ajpiano> ?
[18:32:25] <abjorn> yeah
[18:32:30] <abjorn> simpler times
[18:32:38] <abjorn> also smaller dictionary
[18:32:44] <abjorn> but damnit I think I deserve Tiamat
[18:32:51] <Dave_Stein> hey did you guys know in PHP that comparing an int to a string automatically casts the string as an int in some weird way?
[18:32:57] <imsky> and marduk amirite abjorn
[18:33:01] <Dave_Stein> i for some reason first foudn that out this week and i've done PHP for 10 years lol
[18:33:04] <abjorn> that too
[18:33:06] <Dave_Stein> 0 == 'my string' // true
[18:33:09] <abjorn> i tried cthulhu once, it wouldn't let me
[18:33:24] <Aquaguy> I'm adding an iframe to my page using jquery and I don't know why it applies a green color to the background body[bgcolor=rgb(38,38,38)]{ background-color: #008038 } and I can't get rid of it
[18:33:28] <Aquaguy> anyone, please?
[18:33:29] <imsky> saving wordsquared.com to my faaavs
[18:33:35] <imsky> Aquaguy: holy shit you're desperate
[18:33:55] <Dave_Stein> Aquaguy jQuery has nothing to do with background color of an iframe
[18:34:12] <abjorn> would depend on the content the iframe is loading
[18:34:24] <Dave_Stein> Aquaguy either your iframe is transparent and your site is green, or your iframe is a green page and you've forgotten
[18:34:45] <Aquaguy> it's a embeded pdf
[18:34:51] <abjorn> lol
[18:34:56] <imsky> you know they're building pdf.js right
[18:35:20] <abjorn> why do you need to make an iframe to insert an embedded pdf?
[18:35:35] <abjorn> just use the google docs thingy to embed, or something like pdf.js
[18:35:38] <imsky> abjorn: when's the last time you checked your bank statements
[18:35:50] <abjorn> uh like the other day, why
[18:35:55] <imsky> they don't use pdf at all?
[18:36:04] <abjorn> yeah they do
[18:36:09] <abjorn> I download them.
[18:36:14] <abjorn> it's not embedded
[18:36:15] <imsky> paypal embeds them in an iframe
[18:36:19] <Aquaguy> 'cause if I insert it inside of a div instead of an iframe the pdf doesn't fits the div's width and always appears a horizontal scroll (of course when you manually zoom out, the scroll goes away)
[18:36:20] <imsky> or a frame, which is worse
[18:36:58] <abjorn> that's why you use a pdf viewer like google docs to embed :)
[18:37:11] <Dave_Stein> that's why i don't have PDFs on any of my sites except to download / open in a new window
[18:37:14] <Dave_Stein> :)
[18:37:14] <abjorn> actually i guess for something like bank statements that wouldn't fly
[18:37:17] <imsky> abjorn: from a https domain?
[18:37:21] <imsky> think man think
[18:37:32] <abjorn> PSH
[18:37:39] <abjorn> SSL, schmeshSL
[18:37:40] <imsky> oh yeah
[18:37:48] <imsky> how many of your IRL friends signed up for G+?
[18:37:54] <imsky> since it's gone public
[18:37:56] <abjorn> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[18:37:58] <abjorn> like
[18:38:00] <abjorn> 15-20
[18:38:01] <Dave_Stein> too many before it was public and zero since it has
[18:38:06] <imsky> god damn
[18:38:12] <imsky> that's a lot
[18:38:21] <abjorn> no one uses it though
[18:38:24] <Dave_Stein> is there really ap oint to join?
[18:38:27] <abjorn> except linus torvalds apparently
[18:38:27] <Aquaguy> how can I read the pdf hosted in my server with google docs and show it on my page
[18:38:29] <Dave_Stein> they just wanna fight facebook is all
[18:38:31] <imsky> i wonder if G+ is skewed towards the geek social set
[18:38:39] <abjorn> seems like it
[18:38:45] <Dave_Stein> G+ = the next version of Wave
[18:38:47] <abjorn> most of my coworkers have one
[18:38:49] <Dave_Stein> just wait a year and it will be saying bye
[18:38:52] <imsky> Dave_Stein: wtf are you talking about
[18:38:56] <imsky> i use wave daily
[18:39:01] <abjorn> wave was useful
[18:39:05] <abjorn> people still want to use wave
[18:39:12] <abjorn> that's why they open-sourced it
[18:39:13] <imsky> hence why it got jabopensourced
[18:39:17] <imsky> oh shit legit mates
[18:39:33] <abjorn> no, the better analogy would be google buzz
[18:39:42] <abjorn> except google buzz failed even harder
[18:39:46] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah i forgot about that one even
[18:39:48] <Dave_Stein> that did fail harder
[18:39:54] <imsky> G+ is gonna stick around i think
[18:40:10] <Dave_Stein> i didnt even know that wave had an open source project haha
[18:40:26] <Dave_Stein> are masses of non-coders using it though?
[18:40:28] <frio_> i miss wave
[18:40:38] <imsky> frio_: it's still open... http://wave.google.com
[18:40:44] <Dave_Stein> i can make a failed project and release it to developers but that doesn't make it better, just means the target audience shuold have  been prorgammers and not the world
[18:40:48] <Dave_Stein> excuse typos :)
[18:41:08] <Dave_Stein> You can still log in, edit and export your waves, and wave.google.com will remain in service until there is another way to access your data. To learn more, visit our blog.
[18:41:10] <frio_> yeah imsky, but im in a new flat now where we dont spend good chunks of our day hating on eachother via wave
[18:41:19] <imsky> you hate on people via wave?
[18:41:19] <Dave_Stein> its still there just cause google refuses to let data die since that would be against them.
[18:41:23] <imsky> i get shit done with my team on wave
[18:41:32] <frio_> its the ideal hate ether
[18:41:45] <imsky> 0_o
[18:41:45] <Dave_Stein> i use digsby? :)
[18:42:11] <imsky> lol
[18:42:28] <imsky> abjorn: when they ask you to fix their websights, do they ever offer to pay
[18:42:29] <abjorn> wave is great for getting shit done
[18:42:33] <abjorn> no
[18:42:35] <abjorn> they dont
[18:42:38] <imsky> loool
[18:42:41] <abjorn> they feel very entitled
[18:42:48] <Dave_Stein> ya know on that note, "The Wave" was a real good book back in high school haha
[18:42:50] <abjorn> and think i should do everything always
[18:42:51] <abjorn> right away
[18:43:01] <imsky> abjorn: lol PLZ SIR
[18:43:14] <imsky> my wife will starve if my websights r not fixed
[18:43:31] <Dave_Stein> that's a lie
[18:43:34] <Dave_Stein> she's fat so she can lasta while
[18:43:37] <frio_> reminds me of a former life in residential dsl support
[18:43:51] <frio_> plz sir fix my residential interwebs connection IMMEDIATELY because I AM RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE
[18:43:56] <imsky> hahahah
[18:43:58] <Dave_Stein> dear god let my build finish so i can leave here
[18:44:09] <imsky> frio_: plz YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
[18:44:17] <s34n> http://api.jquery.com/submit/   claims that $("form").submit() will cause onsubmits to fire
[18:44:25] <imsky> s34n: god damn right
[18:44:27] <s34n> but that does not seem to be the case
[18:44:27] <Dave_Stein> it does
[18:44:30] <Dave_Stein> or my life would be over
[18:44:43] <Dave_Stein> s34n you probably have a JS error before it hits that line :)
[18:44:51] <frio_> imsky: one guy once called asking for help with his broken email
[18:44:59] <frio_> while he was using a wifi connection at a hotel
[18:45:08] <frio_> and using third party email for his hosted website
[18:45:19] <frio_> I AM PAYING YOU PEOPLE FOR SUPPORT AND YOU ARE REFUSING TO SUPPLY IT
[18:45:19] <imsky> ahahaha
[18:45:26] <s34n> Dave_Stein: the form is submitting, so the line gets executed
[18:45:37] <Kamakazi> doing calendar/event stuff would be easier if the whole world just ran off of UTC
[18:45:57] <frio_> oh god agree Kamakazi
[18:45:59] <Dave_Stein> if the form is submitting isn't it doing the thing you want it to?
[18:46:03] <imsky> ?"gnipoop".split("").reverse().join("")
[18:46:04] <bot-t> imsky, Couldn't find ""gnipoop".split("").reverse().join("")" in jQuery Docs.
[18:46:14] <frio_> you havent suffered until you've been subjected to java's raw calendar/date libraries though Kamakazi
[18:46:18] <imsky> ?js "gnipoop".split("").reverse().join("")
[18:46:19] <bot-t> imsky: "pooping"
[18:46:24] <imsky> abjorn: wanna code golf?
[18:46:26] <s34n> Dave_Stein: I want all my submit handlers to fire
[18:46:39] <abjorn> wat
[18:46:39] <Dave_Stein> ?js ( typeof imsky === "useful" )
[18:46:40] <bot-t> Dave_Stein: false
[18:46:41] <abjorn> golf?
[18:46:53] <imsky> abjorn: yeah get the above shit down to less bytes
[18:47:00] <saimon69> still trying to make act two checkboxes together binded by value, can select it/unselect it once but then does not work second time - http://jsfiddle.net/TM5mp/
[18:47:01] <imsky> Dave_Stein: holy crap you're full of bile
[18:47:33] <Dave_Stein> hahaha
[18:47:38] <Dave_Stein> it took you that long?
[18:47:56] <imsky> i just assumed you're an asspie with retarded social skills
[18:48:04] <paul_irish> :)
[18:48:08] <Dave_Stein> i think you're describing everyone in the room
[18:48:08] <Kamakazi> frio_: I'll take your word for it and hope it never happens
[18:48:14] <imsky> Dave_Stein: no just you sweetheart
[18:48:25] <saimon69> using jquery 1.4.3 for compatibility reasons
[18:48:44] <Dave_Stein> <3333
[18:48:48] <frio_> Kamakazi: if you're not a religious man, take it up and start praying you're never exposed to them
[18:48:51] <s34n> I want any handler I have bound to the form's submit even to fire when I $(form).submit()
[18:48:53] <frio_> they're an exercise in ritualistic self-abuse
[18:48:57] <s34n> *event
[18:49:04] <Dave_Stein> imsky i like that paul_irish first statement in like 20 minutes was a smiley to that
[18:49:31] <imsky> i like how you talk about minutiae
[18:49:32] <paul_irish> who doesn't love asspies?!
[18:49:32] <Dave_Stein> if you're not preventing default on submit, you're getting taken away from the page on submit
[18:49:39] <imsky> paul_irish: i love me an asspie
[18:49:43] <paul_irish> ++
[18:49:45] <imsky> made with real ass
[18:49:52] <imsky> no preservatives
[18:49:53] <Dave_Stein> imsky: it's the little things in life
[18:50:02] <imsky> Dave_Stein: wrong
[18:50:04] <abjorn> 20 lbs of pussy and ass
[18:50:06] <Kamakazi> frio_: Roger that
[18:50:14] <imsky> abjorn: you got donkey and cat meat?
[18:50:17] <Dave_Stein> imsky: disagree

[18:54:38] <imsky> lmao
[18:54:44] <saimon69> actually is on firefox that click does not work
[18:54:45] <paul_irish> i think you should just bind to click
[18:54:51] <paul_irish> also
[18:54:55] <paul_irish> .removeAttr('checked')
[18:54:56] <saimon69> in mine at least -3.6
[18:55:06] <imsky> or should it be
[18:55:10] <paul_irish> and .attr('checked','checked')
[18:55:11] <imsky> .prop("checked",false)
[18:55:19] <paul_irish> or that.
[18:55:47] <imsky> abjorn: what japonese sight did you paste that from
[18:55:55] <abjorn> none
[18:55:56] <Dave_Stein> saimon69: http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/fQSLt/1/ click isnt broken on ie

[18:56:57] <Dave_Stein> saimon69: it works in all browers
[18:57:30] <Dave_Stein> saimon69: .click will always work its a pretty basic event... checking for checked can be screwy and they already pointed out you should be using prop these days

[18:58:56] <saimon69> @dave_stein i am using jquery 1.4.3 for compatibility reason
[18:59:06] <saimon69> changed on http://jsfiddle.net/TM5mp/2/
[18:59:17] <saimon69> now not even try to check
[18:59:46] <Dave_Stein> hold on doing work
[19:00:27] <abjorn> they're going nuts cause he sounds a lot like freddy mercury
[19:00:33] <paul_irish> he does.
[19:00:37] <imsky> yeah i got that
[19:00:49] <abjorn> and freddy mercury is a bawss
[19:00:50] * imsky doesn't listen to queen at all
[19:00:54] <Dave_Stein> but im pretty sure on an old version you can do .is(':checked') safely and then do $('#el')[0].checked = true
[19:00:55] * imsky or any rock
[19:00:59] <Dave_Stein> that should do it
[19:01:01] <Dave_Stein> right?
[19:01:25] <abjorn> well, whether you like rock or not,you should be able to tell that freddy is/was a bawss hogg singer
[19:01:45] <imsky> he was a country boy?
[19:02:40] <abjorn> no just british
[19:02:52] <imsky> sounds good brah
[19:03:07] <imsky> i do recall brohemian rhapsody from wayne's world
[19:03:16] <abjorn> everyone does
[19:03:27] <abjorn> and everyone should
[19:03:36] <danieliser> ajpiano: still on?
[19:03:43] <abjorn> wow how long has that new yayquery episode been up?
[19:03:49] <saimon69> imsky; dave_stein: http://jsfiddle.net/TM5mp/3/ with html this time
[19:03:51] <ajpiano> since it was recorded
[19:03:52] <abjorn> i stopped checking the site because it had been so long :(
[19:03:53] <ajpiano> danieliser: wassup
[19:04:04] <saimon69> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/TM5mp/3/ with html this time
[19:04:34] <imsky> saimon69: wtf are you trying to do
[19:04:50] <danieliser> ajpiano: found a solution.. opacity:0.01. Invisible to the eye.. but rendered enough to get the widht and height for centering
[19:05:03] <ajpiano> danieliser: you could have like
[19:05:05] <ajpiano> used visibility:hidden
[19:05:08] <ajpiano> i should have said that
[19:05:10] <ajpiano> i assumed you knew
[19:05:16] <saimon69> click one checkbox, the other one got selected/unselected too - that is what am trying to do
[19:05:29] <saimon69> imsky: click one checkbox, the other one got selected/unselected too - that is what am trying to do
[19:05:42] <imsky> saimon69: you're doing it wrong
[19:06:07] <danieliser> no.. i needed to center the a hidden div.. without the height than width you cant do it right.. if its hidden height and width are returned 0
[19:06:15] <saimon69> well i only can retrieve the value to doing that, not ID
[19:07:01] <Dave_Stein> saimon69: why arent you using radios?
[19:07:27] <saimon69> mean the boxes in the original are generated via PHP and mysql and this is a (stupid) requests of my boss
[19:07:38] <imsky> saimon69: your name and value attributes are backwards too
[19:07:40] <saimon69> because need to have multiple choices
[19:08:37] <saimon69> and this is a special case of an article that has to appear in two categories and be checked in both at once (not my idea)
[19:09:31] <abjorn> v8, y u so hrd to compile on win7????
[19:09:39] <imsky> r u using msys?
[19:09:46] <abjorn> nofuckthat
[19:09:53] <imsky> haha GOOD LUCK BRO
[19:10:07] <abjorn> it doesn't matter, it's a scons build
[19:10:13] <saimon69> dave_stein because need to have multiple choices
[19:10:16] <abjorn> it uses the vc++ compiler
[19:10:29] <saimon69> dave_stein: because need to have multiple choices
[19:10:36] <saimon69> dave_stein: and this is a special case of an article that has to appear in two categories and be checked in both at once (not my idea)
[19:10:37] <Murugaratham> how do  i get all functions that are bound to the element
[19:10:52] <Dave_Stein> $('#el').data().events
[19:10:54] <Dave_Stein> but thts kinda lame
[19:11:00] <imsky> saimon69: http://jsfiddle.net/TM5mp/4/
[19:11:11] <Murugaratham> hmm doesnt work..
[19:11:15] <Dave_Stein> saimon69 sorry my build is done so its time to go home, hopefully imsky will be of use
[19:11:30] <imsky> abjorn: sounds shady, i'm sure it compiles with gcc too
[19:11:40] <abjorn> well course it does
[19:11:44] <abjorn> on win its meant to compile with vc tho
[19:11:56] <imsky> why are you doing it anyway
[19:12:01] <imsky> there are .dlls you can just link in
[19:12:15] <Dave_Stein> oh whoops tis in data under the jquery randomly named object
[19:12:18] <abjorn> cause I need the .lib as well?
[19:12:20] <Dave_Stein> Murugaratham
[19:12:22] <Dave_Stein> but yeah im outta here
[19:12:23] <abjorn> chrome isnt gonna give me the .lib
[19:12:26] <imsky> abjorn: :(
[19:12:27] <Dave_Stein> see you later
[19:12:29] <Dave_Stein> especially you imsky
[19:12:33] <Dave_Stein> for the asspies
[19:12:37] <abjorn> also i need debug lib and dll
[19:12:51] <abjorn> also the revision i have may not be the one my chrome has
[19:12:56] <abjorn> so the header files may not match
[19:12:57] <paul_irish> i dont understand how HE will see YOU later for the asspies when he IS the asspie

[19:40:14] <imsky> awww ye
[19:40:18] <imsky> is this with philogl
[19:40:38] <paul_irish> nah
[19:40:56] <imsky> well it crashed firefox
[19:40:58] <imsky> so good for it
[19:41:31] <ngharo> when we getting WebRTC paul_irish? :)
[19:41:57] <paul_irish> soon
[19:42:40] <ngharo> do you think google will develop the components for firefox also?
[19:49:57] <paul_irish> ngharo: google essentially is doing that yes.
[19:50:15] <paul_irish> goog is building the tech . moz is already working on plugging it in
[19:50:47] <Heshanh> if i do .serialize() on a form. is there way to encode the data into json format? do i have to build it manually
[19:50:49] <ngharo> awesome.  i think it's going to be a huge thing
[19:57:50] <manizzle> hey guys. I am using ajaxForm to submit a form. what do i have to have it redirect with the servers response?
[19:58:40] <coldhead> cant you do that most simply by just not using ajax?
[20:00:09] <manizzle> i guess.
[20:01:33] <frio_> window.location.reload manizzle?
[20:02:20] <frio_> or refresh or replace or w/e it is
[20:02:23] <frio_> :<
[20:07:53] <coldhead> window.location = 'aids.com';
[20:08:08] <coldhead> but just do without the ajax and \o/
[20:13:00] <oojacoboo> /add support tab inside <body>
[20:13:01] <oojacoboo>         $('body').add('<a id="support-tab" onclick="script: Zenbox.show(); return false;" href="#">Support</a>');
[20:13:07] <oojacoboo> can someone tell me why that wouldn't be working?
[20:13:21] <oojacoboo> is 'body' no good selector?
[20:16:21] <oojacoboo> do I need to do something like appendChild?
[20:16:29] <oojacoboo> b/c it's the <body> tag?
[20:18:19] <coldhead> oojacoboo: firstly, what is add?
[20:18:24] <coldhead> it doesn't do what you think it does
[20:18:28] <coldhead> you want append()
[20:18:31] <coldhead> or html()
[20:18:40] <oojacoboo> html would replace, no?
[20:18:50] <oojacoboo> looking at the api on append() now
[20:19:08] <oojacoboo> coldhead: I really want it at the top of the <body>
[20:19:14] <oojacoboo> not appended to the bottom
[20:20:29] <coldhead> do you know the antonym for append?
[20:20:33] <coldhead> ?prepend
[20:20:33] <bot-t> .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[20:20:35] <oojacoboo> prepend
[20:20:49] <oojacoboo> yea, I saw that, but I thought that was the same as before()
[20:21:05] <oojacoboo> which would not put it INSIDE the <body> but before it
[20:21:22] <coldhead> no, they're different
[20:21:39] <oojacoboo> k
[20:21:39] <coldhead> but the next whole terrible thing we have to deal with is this onclick busienss
[20:21:53] <coldhead> you just can't do that anymore, oojacoboo
[20:22:00] <coldhead> those days are gone
[20:22:09] <coldhead> you'll need to use ?click
[20:22:09] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[20:22:21] <oojacoboo> coldhead: tell that to zendesk.com :/
[20:22:44] <coldhead> bot-t: tell zendesk.com IF YOU DON'T STOP USING ONCLICK I WILL BREAK EVERY FINGER IN YOUR MASTURBATION HAND
[20:22:45] <bot-t> coldhead, Invalid nick: "zendesk.com".
[20:22:50] <coldhead> damn
[20:22:53] <coldhead> well i tried
[20:22:56] <oojacoboo> ha
[20:23:29] <oojacoboo> coldhead: for the record, we use the event handlers
[20:23:34] <oojacoboo> not onclick()
[20:23:40] <coldhead> may it continue
[20:32:04] <saddishwasher> hey guys
[20:33:57] <Aristata> How can I make the map draggable when i want it to be? I can't find a method or option anywhere
[20:34:27] <kborchers> sadistwasher!!!
[20:34:50] <Aristata> not quite the answer i was hoping for
[20:34:53] <Aristata> :p
[20:35:03] <kborchers> sorry, i just can't resist saddishwasher
[20:35:17] <Aristata> lol
[20:37:33] <saddishwasher> kboardshorts!
[20:37:59] <kborchers> :)
[20:38:12] <kborchers> no rest for the wicked eh?
[20:38:19] <saddishwasher> Aristata, map like this? http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/7CYAc/
[20:38:32] <saddishwasher> kborchers, definitely not
[20:38:53] <kborchers> saddishwasher: i still love that map ... need to find a use for it
[20:39:03] <saddishwasher> Aristata, thats probably not what you're looking for, but I like showing that off when applicable
[20:39:24] <saddishwasher> kborchers, EXACTLY, so do I!! right now it just sits in fiddle limbo
[20:40:31] <Aristata> saddishwasher:  Thanks!
[20:41:08] <saddishwasher> Aristata, now back to your question......what was it?
[20:41:09] <Aristata> saddishwasher:  lol but yeah not quie what I was looking for
[20:41:16] <kborchers> it would be really good for one of those live election results things next year
[20:41:32] <Aristata> I want to enable dragging at a specific point in my "workflow", and disable it after
[20:41:35] <saddishwasher> lol, yea, get obama's staff to use it
[20:41:39] <Aristata> I can't find anything to do it though
[20:41:48] <Aristata> I thought I could do map.setDraggable or something
[20:42:51] <saddishwasher> Aristata, are you using coordinates?
[20:43:33] <Aristata> I am using pretty much everything in the toolbox
[20:43:45] <saddishwasher> not sure what that means
[20:43:50] <Aristata> lol
[20:43:58] <Aristata> Here is the thing
[20:44:10] <Aristata> I have regions, sub regions, schools, leaderboards, heatmaps, etc
[20:44:17] <Aristata> click a region, it zooms to it
[20:44:25] <Aristata> click the subregions, it zooms to it
[20:44:34] <Aristata> at that point I want to enable map dragging
[20:44:47] <Aristata> when not on the subregion, I want to disable it
[20:44:59] <Aristata> so I just need to know how to make that little grabby hand enable and disable
[20:45:08] <Aristata> ya know?
[20:45:23] <saddishwasher> ?demo
[20:45:24] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:45:37] <saddishwasher> give me something to test
[20:45:41] <saddishwasher> paleze
[20:45:55] <saddishwasher> kborchers, you already looked into this problem?
[20:46:34] <kborchers> nah, just lurking and grabbing the easy one ;)  pretty busy tonight
[20:49:24] <saddishwasher> creeper
[20:50:30] <Heshanh> ive got a strange question. strang prob cos im a noob at jQ. if i change the src of a img. is there way to know when the new image is loaded? i want to show some sort of a loading msg untill the new image is loaded
[20:51:38] <saddishwasher> ?load @ Heshanh
[20:51:39] <bot-t> Heshanh, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:52:41] <saddishwasher> and .error() will even let you change the src to an error img if the original img errors out
[20:52:47] <saddishwasher> ?error @ Heshanh
[20:52:47] <bot-t> Heshanh, .error(handler): Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/error/
[20:53:06] <Heshanh> Thanks :)
[20:54:03] <kborchers> ?imagesloaded @ Heshanh
[20:54:04] <bot-t> Heshanh, imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[20:54:22] <saddishwasher> ahh nice one
[20:54:41] <saddishwasher> kborchers++
[20:55:08] <saddishwasher> never used that (still all sorts of plugins I've never seen before)
[20:55:26] <kborchers> i haven't either but remember seeing it some time
[20:55:30] <Heshanh> hmm the img is under 50k i wonder if its worth coding that bit in
[20:55:47] <Heshanh> 43.3 to be exact

[21:25:14] <slavka`2> hey guys... if i have an element that is the 4th table column... how can i grab the content of the 2nd table column of the same row?
[21:30:56] <saddishwasher> slavka`2, where $(this) is your 4th table column cell - $(this).parent().find('td:nth-child(2)')
[21:31:11] <kborchers> slavka`2: $("fourthColumn").prev().prev() or $("fourthColumn").parent().children().eq(1) or $("fourthColumn").prevAll().eq(1) and i'm sure there are more ;)
[21:31:57] <saddishwasher> kborchers, you didn't mention mine :(
[21:32:25] <coldhead> enough talk
[21:33:11] <kborchers> that was in my i'm sure there are more part ... but those : selectors are slow so i try to do those last
[21:33:38] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[21:33:39] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[21:34:46] <kborchers> but optimisation is so much fun :p
[21:35:00] <saddishwasher> and also in my job description
[21:35:46] <saddishwasher> kborchers, $("fourthColumn").parent().children().eq(1) will give the first column td cell....not the second...right?
[21:35:52] <janthony> How do you find the index of an element? I'm trying .index() but it's returning a -1
[21:36:16] <Cork> saddishwasher: no arrays is zero based
[21:36:20] <kborchers> no 0 based
[21:36:44] <saddishwasher> oh yea, and boom goes the dynamite
[21:36:46] <Cork> janthony: is the element added to the dom?
[21:37:11] <janthony> Cork: via jquery or ajax? no, it's just a standard element that loads with the dom
[21:37:30] <Cork> janthony: what type of element?
[21:37:45] <janthony> Cork: $("#hb0 div a").click(function(){ console.log($(this).index());
[21:38:36] <janthony> Cork:  #hb0 contains 4 div's, which is what I really want to grab the index of, if that's possible, so maybe $(this).parent().index() or something
[21:39:14] <janthony> Cork: Other words, I want to find the index of of the div inside #hbo as each div only contains one anchor
[21:39:40] <Cork> janthony: $(this).closest('div').index()?
[21:39:59] <Cork> janthony: i'm just testing it, but it might be that inline elements doesn't work with index
[21:40:35] <janthony> Cork: Div is a block element though.
[21:40:55] <Cork> janthony: and the line i just gave you should work ya
[21:41:05] <janthony> Cork: Yeah, just tried it, still -1
[21:41:25] <Cork> janthony: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/9cBDL/
[21:41:36] <Cork> janthony: you need to pb example code
[21:44:20] <janthony> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/9cBDL/1/ - yeah, this works, not sure why it isn't working on mine, hrm.
[21:47:17] <Cork> janthony: run it through w3c validate and jshint
[21:47:29] <Cork> should prob point you to the problem
[21:53:28] <muzone> I just made this really cool vector map here: http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map.html - what y'all think of the code though?
[21:54:47] <muzone> As usual it started out pretty rough. Hopefully in the end though it'll be real tight like http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/Miss_Chatterbox.htm
[22:09:23] <danieliser> ajax loading images in a modal with next/prev buttons.. anyway to cache the images if theyve been loaded and use the cached if they view it again?

[23:04:29] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[23:04:34] <Double_Rainbow> i have a select box
[23:04:52] <Double_Rainbow> how do i set its values dynamically with jquery?
[23:05:16] <Double_Rainbow> possible options are values 0,1,2,3,4
[23:05:46] <Double_Rainbow> i want that each time the user hits reload, the values automatically set to 0
[23:06:17] <Double_Rainbow> i do not have this problem with Chrome, but in Firefail, the forms values remains
[23:06:30] <Double_Rainbow> even when you reload the page
[23:06:50] <coldhead> there's no need to talk about firefox in that way
[23:07:06] <coldhead> it's easy to forget how long it was our only hope

[23:42:15] <johnywp> hey all
[23:42:23] <dismist> sup mothafucka
[23:42:27] <johnywp> i am using wp
[23:42:30] <johnywp> and buddypress
[23:42:40] <johnywp> together with a jquery plugin for an animation
[23:43:24] <johnywp> for some reason, there is a conflict between the animation plugin and buddypress because when active, some BP links don't work, and when I don't load the jquery with the animation plugin, the BP links work. any ideas?
