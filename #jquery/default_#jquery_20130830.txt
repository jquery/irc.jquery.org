[00:00:00] <doug65536> Whirl3d: sorry, I mean $('.test')...
[00:01:09] <Whirl3d> filter checks to see if it matches the filter contents...right.   so event.target has to match the selector contents....$("div") checks all the divs to see if inside them a ".test" class matches
[00:01:21] <Whirl3d> put a div around the testclass and it should work
[00:01:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/LCFPD/8/
[00:02:11] <WG1337> Oh, found one. If anyone else needs something like that: Simple Tooltip jquery
[00:02:12] <Whirl3d> see, now the outside div runs the filter and sure enough, it finds .test inside it, so it filters true
[00:02:23] <doug65536> Whirl3d: right, which means it is like $('div').find('*').filter('.test').length > 0
[00:02:49] <Whirl3d> when he said "selector" he was referring to the internal selector,,,not the outside selector
[00:03:41] <Whirl3d> $(".test").on("mousemove", "selector", function (e) { if ($(selector).filter(event.target).length>0....
[00:03:52] <doug65536> Whirl3d: yes, so lesson learned is when you specify that selector as a parameter to on, it can only work of that selector is a child of the thing to which you are binding the event
[00:04:05] <doug65536> s/of that/if that/
[00:04:56] <Whirl3d> yeah. I think of it like this:  $(element).on   is saying,   "element should listen for any bubbled events that happen within  it
[00:05:24] <Whirl3d> and the target of that event can be found $(e.target)....but only in the scope of element. Just like you said.
[00:06:21] <Whirl3d> I find that I never use the selector paramter in on....I just check inside myself by if ($(event.target).is(myWatchedElement)) { do stuff
[00:07:05] <doug65536> Whirl3d: but this:  "if ($(selector).filter(event.target).length>0"  is wrong though, because $('.test.').filter(event.target).length>0  is true when you mouse around in .test
[00:07:32] <doug65536> s/\/'/'/
[00:07:46] <celtiore_> hi, i need help to adapt css for jquerymobile, i can't find the solution : http://www.demo.projetpos.fr
[00:08:13] <celtiore_> need help in header to align icons thk
[00:08:29] <doug65536> Whirl3d: which is why I'm saying it is more like if ($(selector).find('*').filter(event.target).length>0
[00:08:32] <Whirl3d> write out the full .on statement for me... because the term selector is getting bandied about
[00:08:51] <doug65536> Whirl3d: which is why I'm saying it is more like if ($('.test').find('*').filter(event.target).length>0
[00:09:27] <doug65536> Whirl3d: this: $('div').on('mousemove', '.test', function() ...
[00:09:27] <Whirl3d> that is true for $("element").on("mousemove",".test", function() {
[00:09:48] <Whirl3d> that sets up the on handler for every div
[00:09:56] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: your link results in a blank page
[00:10:05] <Whirl3d> so as long as you have an div wrapped around .test it will work
[00:10:19] <Whirl3d> but not if test is the outermost div
[00:10:39] <doug65536> Whirl3d: I'm not trying to fix it, I am trying to completely understand why it doesn't work. as long as it has to be a child, that explains it
[00:10:41] <Whirl3d> because "selector" in that case is .test and test is not a child of an element with .on applied
[00:11:21] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, i check
[00:11:23] <celtiore_> thk
[00:12:15] <Whirl3d> so think about it like this:   the inner div does this: $("div div").on("mousemove", function (e) {if ($(e.target).is(".test")) {do stuff
[00:12:23] <Whirl3d> which will never happen
[00:12:54] <doug65536> Whirl3d: normally, I always use that form of on to filter bubbled events... in this case I attempted to use it to do the opposite, get non-bubbled events, which made no sense, so it didn't work
[00:13:23] <celtiore_> hi, i need help to adapt css for jquerymobile, i can't find the solution : http://demo.projetpos.fr :)
[00:13:46] <Whirl3d> $("div div").on("mousemove", function (e) { e.stopPropogation();});
[00:14:27] <doug65536> Whirl3d: yes but that would require hard coding. anyway, I understand now. thanks :)
[00:14:46] <Whirl3d> use css to position the child element outside the test and seee if it fires...
[00:15:18] <blade> anyone know a php channel?
[00:15:46] <obert> ##php
[00:15:50] <doug65536> Whirl3d: it does

[00:16:22] <blade> ty

[00:17:01] <blade> does this mean I need to register?
[00:17:10] <doug65536> blade: yes
[00:20:20] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: what i the problem?
[00:21:05] <celtiore_> icon right in the header, and icon on the collapse list farm animals, not aligned correctly
[00:21:51] <celtiore_> originally theme have 18x18 icon,
[00:21:54] <blade> ##php Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services does this mean I need to reigster my account?
[00:24:29] <blade> obert: ##php Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services does that mean I need to be registered on irc?
[00:25:00] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: you set height 40px for the header in your custom CSS
[00:25:10] <fn> blade: yes
[00:25:11] <obert> blade: dunno
[00:25:22] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: the right button in the header is 38px high
[00:25:23] <blade> thanks you
[00:25:28] <blade> thank you fn:
[00:25:36] <blade> to google I go to figure out how to register
[00:25:54] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: but you set top 2px for the right button
[00:26:06] <fn> blade: /ns help register
[00:27:59] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: what you can do is setting top: 50% and margin-top: -19px (half the height of your button)
[00:28:50] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: that way your button will be aligned in the middle (vertical)
[00:28:53] <blade> how do I change my name?
[00:29:13] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, it's not my theme, i try to adapt others icons
[00:31:21] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: I don't see how that is relevant
[00:31:54] <camelCapsDay> any idea on how to get the NAME from this object? The value is printing now:             {{each $.parseJSON(page.attr)}} ${$name} ${$value} <br/> {{/each}}
[00:32:05] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, i fix the right icon header, now how can i have the same height in header, with button with text and button notext
[00:33:13] <celtiore_> you can find in jquerymobile 132 css at /*(line 2080)*/
[00:37:25] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: .ui-header .ui-btn-inner { padding: 8px 11px 5px; min-height: 22px; }
[00:38:38] <le_gars> hello. Im wondering if anyone here could help me debug some code of mine? Im responding to a rails 3 remote form with ajax:succes and such. Ive been over the code several time. Right now Im able to send the form show errors is any.
[00:39:15] <le_gars> What I would like to do is when successful fade out the form and show a thank you text briefly
[00:41:38] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, i check thk
[00:41:46] <uGoMobi> yw
[00:43:42] <doonie> hi
[00:44:13] <grafi> le_gars show some code
[00:45:33] <le_gars> grafi: coming right up
[00:46:56] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, .ui-header .ui-btn-inner { /*padding: 8px 11px 5px;*/ min-height: 22px; } works, but now need to align text in header button ;)
[00:48:07] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: why did you comment out the padding? I added that custom padding for you so the text would be aligned
[00:48:43] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, try now, i put the padding
[00:49:10] <le_gars> bare in mine if been over it several times so not so pretty
[00:49:15] <celtiore_> text are not correctly aligned and icon right notext is wrong too
[00:49:16] <le_gars> grafi:
[00:49:34] <le_gars> http://git.io/ObjTnQ
[00:51:23] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: change the selector to .ui-header .ui-btn-icon-left .ui-btn-inner to target the button at the left only
[00:52:20] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: what browser do you test on? the text in the left button appears aligned in the vertical middle to me
[00:52:42] <celtiore_> chromium debian7
[00:53:30] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: anyway, if you want to adjust it... padding: 8px 11px 5px; <<< increase/decrease the 8px and 5px but make sure they are 13px in total
[00:53:41] <celtiore_> ok thk
[00:53:44] <celtiore_> and last thing
[00:54:12] <celtiore_> probs with control-group and collapsable icon
[00:54:28] <grafi> le_gars wuah coffescript oô
[00:54:30] <grafi> :D
[00:54:54] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: yeah, if you use bigger icons you have to adjust the padding
[00:55:26] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: the padding is set for .ui-btn-inner
[00:55:40] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, i know but i'm not expert in jquerymobile
[00:56:14] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: don't need to be expert in jQuery Mobile, just need to know how to set padding with CSS :)
[00:56:36] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: just use code inspector to see for what element the padding is set
[00:56:49] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: and what selector is used for that rule
[00:57:01] <le_gars_> grafi: I got disconnected, did you have time to look at the code I submitted?
[00:57:12] <grafi> [09:54:36] <grafi> le_gars wuah coffescript oô
[00:57:14] <grafi> [09:54:38] <grafi> :D
[00:57:16] <celtiore_> not expert in css too ;)
[00:57:33] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: copy the selector to your custom CSS and add a new padding rule for it
[00:57:55] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: because your CSS comes after jQM CSS it will override
[00:58:32] <grafi> le_gars_ so when the form submit has validation errors they show up with this code?
[00:58:44] <grafi> but the thankyou text doesnt?
[00:59:32] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, i do it
[00:59:39] <le_gars_> ypu
[00:59:41] <le_gars_> yup
[00:59:45] <celtiore_> but i have understand how to read css file
[01:01:25] <grafi> have you checked the arguments that get passed into the function? because as far as im aware there are only three, or where does the evt come from?
[01:01:32] <celtiore_> this selector : .ui-header .ui-btn-icon-left .ui-btn-inner , only modify btn-inner if it is in icon-left and if icon-left is in header ? tight ?
[01:01:38] <grafi> le_gars_ success
[01:01:39] <grafi> Type: Function( PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[01:01:59] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: correct
[01:02:33] <le_gars_> so remove the evt argument then?
[01:02:33] <celtiore_> now i have to find icon-left in controlgroup .. and change the padding
[01:02:35] <celtiore_> ?
[01:02:59] <grafi> le_gars_ i would at least console log the arguments and see of they contain what you expect them to
[01:04:25] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: you will find .ui-btn-icon-left .ui-btn-inner { padding-left: 40px;} on line 2055 of JQM CSS
[01:04:39] <didiergm> @le_gars not sure if this is the exact code you're using; but your tests e.g. if xhr.responseText == "" should ne in brackets like if (xhr.responseText == "")
[01:04:53] <le_gars_> yea, that makes sense. But what I dont understand is if I can read the error and output them I then send the form when valid. Why cant I fade it out and show the text?
[01:05:10] <uGoMobi> celtiore_: so that's what you can copy to your own CSS and then change the 40px to what works with your icon size
[01:05:35] <dnsdds> Is there a way to reproduce background-size: cover; in jQuery/JS?
[01:05:45] <grafi> le_gars_ hm yeah thats true
[01:06:12] <didiergm> @le_gars fadeout : typo should be .fadeOut(200) not .fadeout 200
[01:06:37] <le_gars_> didiergm: well Im using coffeescript so brackets are not required actually
[01:06:43] <celtiore_> uGoMobi, ok
[01:06:50] <didiergm> ah OK
[01:07:02] <le_gars_> they are omitted
[01:07:29] <didiergm> @le_gars do you have any error in the console ?
[01:09:18] <le_gars_> no, none
[01:09:21] <le_gars_> all dandy
[01:10:21] <didiergm> @le_gars not using coffeescript - I won't be of use then sorry
[01:12:52] <grafi> le_gars_ checked the arguments then?
[01:13:29] <ericx3x> Here is a question. What is the "2.7 Z bytes" thing on http://adayinbigdata.com/...? Is it an image or generated by some javascript? I can't tell.
[01:13:42] <le_gars_> grafi: Im on it
[01:13:48] <le_gars_> thanks gonna check now
[01:15:29] <seutje> ericx3x: http://adayinbigdata.com/img/sprite-infographics01@2x.png
[01:15:49] <ericx3x> ah thanks
[01:16:23] <ericx3x> found it myself just now actually
[01:17:11] <ericx3x> here is another question
[01:17:14] <ericx3x> on this website http://www.waynehelix.com/
[01:17:16] <ericx3x> there is some flash
[01:17:26] <ericx3x> how difficult woudl that be to replicate in jquery?
[01:20:21] <slax0r> ericx3x, what, that movin gas pump?
[01:20:24] <slax0r> moving*
[01:21:06] <_rgn> if it's an animated presentation like that you necessarily wouldn't use just jquery
[01:21:11] <_rgn> there are probably good libraries for doing something like that
[01:22:20] <faraway> ericx3x: for such an animation a library like https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-JS/  would probably fit better.
[01:23:02] <_rgn> http://www.jstween.org/
[01:23:53] <_rgn> http://www.greensock.com/jquery/
[01:24:56] <_rgn> greensock just seems sketchy,  "Club GreenSock membership" are you kidding me
[01:27:36] <beachandbytes> it is pretty awesome tho
[01:30:37] <MiracleBoogie> Hi, how would i get every child that matches X from whitin a .each? Neither find nor children seems to do it. :/
[01:33:38] <beachandbytes> filter
[01:34:01] <Kallgard> Hi! If I want to write my own js plugin, which pattern do you recommend?
[01:34:15] <le_gars_> I have been checking the arguments, it turns out that evt cant be removed otherwise I cant catch the errors.
[01:34:39] <MiracleBoogie> Even that wouldn't have helped. My "entry point" for the search was wrong. An element which doesn't have childs would have it hard to return anything.
[01:34:58] <Guest4733> whoami
[01:35:31] <le_gars_> grafi:
[01:35:41] <beachandbytes> MiracleBoogie, $('.class').children().filter(function () { $(this).attr('whatever') == 'whatever'; }).each(function () { $(this).whatever(); });
[01:35:41] <grr> and the rest of the arguments are what you expect them to be?
[01:35:48] <kev5> hi
[01:36:24] <kev5> anyone online that's familiar with datepicker ???
[01:36:59] <MiracleBoogie> Thansk beachandbytes. :) Already got it working but your solution might be the nicer one!
[01:37:26] <beachandbytes> cool
[01:38:33] <kev5> beachandbytes: Flush from that success -hows about turning your hand to datepicker :-)
[01:39:12] <beachandbytes> what do you need on datepicker?
[01:39:25] <kev5> He bites !
[01:39:53] <kev5> Two instances attached to datepicker - I want to trigger an onblur event
[01:40:36] <kev5> when I attach the onblur to the selector the blur triggers as soon as I click the calendar
[01:41:06] <kev5> $('#something').datepicker(parms).
[01:41:36] <kev5> $('#something').onblur   -   fires when I click on the calendar and not when the calendar closes
[01:45:27] <grafi> le_gars_ so whats xhr.responseText then when the input validates?
[01:45:41] <grafi> i mean there must be a reason you cant step into the if?
[01:47:05] <kev5> http://www.visitfyldecoast.info/jquery/
[01:47:21] <kev5> beachandbytes: ^
[01:47:29] <kev5> example

[01:57:20] <imgrey> how to force it to display dialog only when user clicks on link
[01:59:11] <kev5> beachandbytes: shoots and scores.
[01:59:42] <kev5> beachandbytes: sure I tried the onClose - must have had some other garbage in there interfering - thanks
[02:01:35] <rynkan> I have the worrt fracking architects...
[02:01:56] <faraway> Is there a special reason why the "remove" event that is added by jquery-ui is not part of jquery itself?
[02:06:11] <dan2k3k4> I have an xml string that I want to perform an xpath on, how can I do that in jquery? seems selectors were removed in 1.2 or something?
[02:08:09] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you can't do xpath through jquery, but you can do css queries
[02:09:36] <m8> Hi, in jquery ui.sortable i can clone an element in a connected list?
[02:09:45] <dan2k3k4> Cork: css queries in jquery?
[02:10:14] <Cork> dan2k3k4: yes, $(xml).find('[attribute]') or .find('element name')
[02:10:23] <Cork> #id or .class
[02:10:28] <Cork> and so on
[02:10:55] <dan2k3k4> so if I needed to do .//scene/hotspot[data-is-bar="0"] it would be
[02:11:01] <m8> connectToSortable
[02:11:03] <m8> Good!
[02:11:26] <Cork> dan2k3k4: $(xml).find('scene hotspot[data-is-bar="0"]')
[02:11:31] <dan2k3k4> ah
[02:11:40] <dan2k3k4> much easier (was chaining 3 finds...)
[02:11:50] <dan2k3k4> thanks Cork
[02:11:53] <Cork> np
[02:12:06] <dan2k3k4> so that would return the list of nodes that match that?
[02:12:11] <Cork> yes

[02:23:28] <Whirl3d> how do I select all elements with index greater than n?
[02:24:12] <Whirl3d> *maybe not all...$("li") greater than 5
[02:24:27] <Cork> "index"?
[02:24:32] <Cork> ah
[02:24:56] <Cork> $('ul').children().eq(4).nextAll()
[02:25:30] <Whirl3d> $("li").gt(5)    gives me lis with index >5   $.fn.gt=function (num) { return this.filter(function (i, elem) {
[02:34:11] <Whirl3d> $("li").slice(4) ?
[02:34:51] <imgrey> I found that this example does not work correctly with Jquery 1.9: http://jsfiddle.net/cdeutsch/CaGB4/
[02:34:54] <Cork> ah, yes that is a nice option
[02:34:58] <imgrey> could someone say how to fix that ?
[02:35:02] <imgrey> it opens dialog on page load
[02:50:51] <jop008> I want to have 7 times in my header bar how to do this?
[02:51:06] <jop008> THis is a trial to create a fiddle I want to have 7 times in my header bar how to do this?
[02:51:12] <Cork> jop008: 7 times what?
[02:51:18] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/114/
[02:51:29] <jop008> but document.write i snot allowed
[02:51:37] <jop008> 7 items in a header
[02:51:48] <jop008> <ul> <li 7 times
[02:52:04] <Cork> what what is "header" in this case?
[02:52:40] <Cork> sounds more like your doing server side code in js
[02:53:02] <jop008> a header bar on the page
[02:53:19] <jop008> see the fiddle
[02:53:29] <Cork> it's not in the fiddle
[02:53:45] <Cork> $('selector for the header').append() instead of the write
[02:54:44] <jop008>    strVar += "  <div data-role=\"navbar\" data-grid=\"d\">";
[02:54:50] <jop008> I updated the fiddle
[02:55:02] <Cork> jop008: no it's not in there
[02:55:06] <Cork> cause you don't have any target
[02:55:24] <jop008> target?
[02:55:41] <Cork> for where you want to append the li's
[02:55:50] <Cork> or what you generate in general
[02:55:54] <jop008> to the body
[02:56:01] <Cork> O_o
[02:56:10] <Cork> why would you want to append it to the body?
[02:56:18] <jop008> strvar must be appended
[02:56:18] <Cork> it the body empty?
[02:56:23] <jop008> yes
[02:56:29] <Cork> what are you doing?
[02:56:31] <jop008> for the fiddle it is
[02:56:43] <jop008> trying 2 make a header on a page
[02:56:45] <Cork> jop008: so you want it at the end of the body?
[02:56:51] <Cork> well it would be a footer
[02:56:55] <jop008> top of page
[02:57:04] <Cork> so add a header element, and then append to it
[02:57:17] <jop008> I try see the fiddle

[02:59:25] <jop008> I wasn't a ware of the heaer tag
[02:59:54] <Cork> well you could call it <div id="header"></div> if you like
[03:00:09] <Cork> and replace $('header') with $('#header')
[03:03:42] <mls_> hi guys
[03:04:06] <mls_> anyone with jquery valide plugin knowledge can say me if this is alright ?
[03:04:20] <mls_> success: function (label) {label.nextAll("label.validZone").addClass("valid").removeClass("error");}
[03:15:22] <jop008> Why is the laoyout of the header not conforming my page ? http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/122/
[03:17:23] <seutje> wow
[03:18:56] <jop008> THis is my layout http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-08-30_at_12.17.57_PM-4PDFpFKB.png
[03:19:35] <jop008> using this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/122/
[03:21:31] <seutje> jop008: the CSS or markup differs
[03:27:58] <jop008> Apparently I but my personal CSS in it the rest must be standard jquery
[03:29:05] <jop008> my-header-grid ui- comes from jquery
[03:29:28] <jop008> but not okay on the page
[03:34:08] <jop008> I try to add css with a link rel on the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/124/
[03:35:17] <clocKwize> hey guys
[03:36:33] <clocKwize> When I call this method, it doesn't send any of the custom headers: https://gist.github.com/brightbits/48a2fb9142edaf779677
[03:36:37] <clocKwize> any ideas why?
[03:38:55] <Cork> clocKwize: are you doing cross domain calls?
[03:39:00] <clocKwize> yes
[03:39:32] <Cork> try setting crossDomain: true
[03:39:51] <Cork> hmm no that's the wrong pref
[03:39:57] <clocKwize> that defaults to true when the domain != current domain
[03:40:01] <Cork> (we want the oposite)
[03:40:12] <Cork> ya i know
[03:40:24] <Cork> so set it to crossDomain: false
[03:40:41] <Cork> if the server supports cors it should work
[03:40:45] <Cork> clocKwize: if the server doesn'
[03:40:56] <Cork> *doesn't support cors, then you're out of luck
[03:41:10] <Cork> cause then the browser uses <script> tags
[03:41:15] <Cork> and that can't send headers
[03:41:27] <clocKwize> yeah
[03:42:01] <clocKwize> yeah :/
[03:46:27] <clocKwize> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.just-eat.com/restaurants?q=se19. Origin http://localhost:4567 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[03:46:29] <clocKwize> it is returning that
[03:46:45] <Cork> so you're out of luck
[03:46:53] <Cork> unless you can add response headers to the server
[03:47:20] <clocKwize> nope
[03:47:30] <clocKwize> but they've asked me to write a javascript app to talk to their api
[03:47:31] <clocKwize> lol
[03:47:48] <Cork> only option you have left is to proxy it over another server
[03:48:05] <Cork> clocKwize: then ask them to add the header
[03:48:13] <Cork> should be easy enough
[03:50:56] <clocKwize> hmm, its their code test for jobs.. I thought hey, write a jquery app to talk to their api and get info.. simples
[03:51:07] <clocKwize> surely their API can handle clients already lol
[03:51:25] <Cork> heh nope :)
[03:51:45] <clocKwize> I've started chrome with --disable-web-security
[03:52:00] <clocKwize> to let the requests go through, still doesn't append the headers to the request :/
[03:52:52] <clocKwize> oh man.. I just looked at the gist and the - was missing in the header names
[03:52:59] <clocKwize> rewrote them and it sends them
[03:53:08] <clocKwize> maybe some dodgy characters as i copied them from their PDF
[03:54:33] <Cork> wouldn't surprise me if you got a zero space space or something like that in there
[03:54:39] <Cork> pdf likes those
[04:00:15] <clocKwize> got those headers eating now, except Accept-Charset: utf-8 which doesn't show up (and I get an error back from server saying error accept-charset must be utf-8)
[04:01:31] <Cork> clocKwize: you might have to use beforeSend
[04:01:55] <clocKwize> yeah, trying that
[04:01:57] <clocKwize> :) thanks
[04:02:54] <clocKwize> that doesn't work either, but when I set X-Accept-Charset it shows .. hmm
[04:03:31] <Cork> clocKwize: might be the browser sets the header by default
[04:03:46] <Cork> i have a vague memory of that
[04:03:57] <Cork> try setting the page to utf8
[04:04:01] <clocKwize> it isn't set at all though :/
[04:04:13] <clocKwize> how do you mean?
[04:05:20] <Cork> <meta charset="utf-8"> in the header
[04:05:26] <Cork> (the html files header that is
[04:05:29] <Cork> )
[04:05:47] <clocKwize> oh, have that already :)
[04:06:15] <clocKwize> oh, actually I get this in console: Refused to set unsafe header "Accept-Charset"
[04:08:39] <clocKwize> thats lame
[04:08:45] <Cork> most likely cause the only header supported is utf8
[04:09:13] <Cork> and if you get the server to send/expect something else it can be exploited
[04:11:20] <clocKwize> well, it should send Accept-Charset: utf-8 then
[04:11:23] <clocKwize> not nothing at all
[04:11:37] <clocKwize> because the server is erroring because I'm not sending that! :(
[04:12:04] <Cork> clocKwize: it sends in the accept heder
[04:12:06] <Cork> *header
[04:13:13] <clocKwize> well, it didn't specify charset in Accept
[04:13:30] <clocKwize> it was Accept: application/json; q=0.1 or something
[04:13:43] <Cork> hmm ya, i just noticed...
[04:13:59] <Cork> i could have sword i've seen ; charset=utf-8 in there...
[04:14:51] <clocKwize> it can be in there, maybe some case it is :/
[04:15:56] <Cork> oh, well the server should be the one controlling the charset in my book so...
[04:16:19] <Cork> and i find it kinda silly to have to set the header if it only accepts one value
[04:16:38] <clocKwize> yeah
[04:23:56] <clocKwize> just emailed the recruiter with the reasons I can't complete the task… 1) no CORS header means browsers drop the request considering it a security risk 2) asking me to set Accept-Charset, a unsafe header, which browsers won't allow javascript to set
[04:23:58] <clocKwize> :/
[04:24:02] <clocKwize> maybe its a new code test
[04:24:03] <clocKwize> lol
[04:24:23] <Cork> :)
[04:24:37] <clocKwize> maybe my app could proxy it
[04:24:38] <clocKwize> :/
[04:30:24] <intellix> people using jQuery UI Widget factory… there anything for destroying all binded widgets on an element? I don't know what's on it at runtime, I just want to destroy all
[04:31:06] <Cork> intellix: no, there isn't
[04:31:07] <intellix> actually, I'm removing the element from DOM, wondering if it calls destroy on binded stuff automatically
[04:31:19] <Cork> intellix: you could serialize the dom to html, and parse it again
[04:31:32] <Cork> but that would leave all modifications any widget might have done
[04:31:49] <intellix> I just want to call my _destroy method to cleanup myself
[04:32:07] <Cork> intellix: if you want to clean up your own call do .yourPlugin('destroy')
[04:32:12] <intellix> for instance, I have $('.overlay') and when I close, I remove it from the DOM, but I also attach other stuff to it…. so would like to destroy anything on there as well
[04:32:40] <intellix> aye, I'm doing that, but want to .allPlugins('destroy')… unless it happens automatically on DOM removal
[04:33:17] <intellix> figured maybe theres something like.......
[04:33:42] <intellix> $('.overlay').ui.widget with an array of binded plugins so I can loop through it destroy each one
[04:34:05] <nitram201000_> anyone used jquery mobile with phonegap? I am using an iframe to embed a site within the app, but this is not workign for me. anyone know of the best way to embed a website into a phonegap app. phonegaps inappbrowser does not seem to let me retain the header and footer
[04:36:31] <faraway> intellix: i don't use jquery-ui much, but currently exploring its source. The jquery-ui adds an "remove" event that is injected into the 'cleanData' part  that is called when the element is removed form dom. the the widget listens to this and calls 'this.destroy()'
[04:36:58] <rynkan> how would i go on creating/defining a new object: clicky:{x=0,y=0}? new Object() seems wrong to me
[04:37:48] <rynkan> so i can use it like console.log(clicky.x)
[04:38:19] <intellix> so it is possible to listen for a removal… so it would be doing that automatically
[04:39:17] <faraway> intellix: to me it looks like it is doing it. but as i said i don't use jquery-ui much so i can say for sure. You coud look into the source of 'jquery.ui.widget.js'  at _createWidget to check yourself
[04:41:02] <intellix> yeah it's automatic… awesome
[04:41:16] <faraway> intellix: and at the beginning of the file you see the replacement of $.cleanData. cleanData should be called for every element that is removed from dom
[04:41:20] <intellix> I wasn't sure if it was possible in JS to know if an element was removed or not
[04:41:28] <intellix> perfetto!
[04:42:32] <faraway> intellix: well it is a jquery feature. only if you call .remove jquery does a check for the element and all is descendants if there is any data or event listeners attached to clean this up
[04:43:21] <faraway> intellix: that why you should not remove elements with pure javascript if you have data or event listeners attached with jquery
[04:43:59] <slartsa> I've found it to be a tricky task to have multiple images automatically scale with correct proportions as new images are added to same area
[04:44:37] <faraway> intellix: and in this cleanup process '$.cleanData'  is called and jquery-ui triggers a remove event at that place
[04:44:39] <slartsa> they should as well be aware of the proportions of their parent to fill as much space of their parent element
[04:44:49] <doug65536> I'm trying to find a straight answer in google but I haven't had much success. is bootstrap a jquery plugin or not
[04:45:04] <pt> after googling a lot i have came here

[04:45:56] <pt> does any one have idea how to give such animation effect?
[04:46:24] <pt> using jquery - how can we display scrolling effect? images are overlapped
[04:46:46] <blackmesa> Hi all. anyone can tell me why the 'beforeSend:' in my code only works in firefox, not chrome or ie10? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d277a9d8bec14476dd29
[04:46:53] <doug65536> jop008: good luck with navbar - it's one of the worst things in jqm
[04:48:30] <jop008> keep the faith
[04:49:09] <doug65536> jop008: 5 items per row is documented max, see http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html
[04:50:43] <jop008> If I resize the items to 10% still it doen't fit
[04:50:44] <doug65536> jop008: same demo, newer version, same limit http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html
[04:50:55] <doug65536> jop008: by design. navbar sucks. 5 items per row max
[04:51:44] <jop008> okay so I must do a redesign of my page :-)
[04:51:46] <doug65536> jop008:  "jQuery Mobile has a very basic navbar widget that is useful for providing up to 5 buttons with optional icons in a bar, typically within a header or footer
[04:51:57] <doug65536> key word: very
[04:52:22] <jop008> Okay clear
[04:52:33] <doug65536> jop008: jqm is awesome. navbar is probably the worst part of it

[04:55:06] <MalMen> i want remove and convert to a number
[04:55:15] <MalMen> to stay with -0.0003 only

[04:55:57] <Cork> .replace(/[()]/g, '')
[04:57:37] <jop008> Solved
[04:58:03] <jop008> change of gui
[04:59:25] <pt> hello
[05:01:03] <doug65536> MalMen: to convert it to a number, put + before it, or use parseInt
[05:02:18] <doug65536> js> print(typeof "(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, "")); print("(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, "")); print(typeof +"(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, ""));
[05:02:24] <b-ot> doug65536: string -0.0003 number
[05:02:36] <doug65536> js> print(typeof "(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, "")); print(+"(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, "")); print(typeof +"(-0.0003)".replace(/\(|\)/g, ""));
[05:02:43] <b-ot> doug65536: string -0.0003 number
[05:03:42] <doug65536> MalMen: and ya, cork's regex is 1 character shorter, go with that
[05:04:14] <Cork> remember to always use a base if you use parseInt though
[05:04:27] <MalMen> hmmm, thank you :)
[05:05:44] <_Propheteus> hi guys
[05:05:52] <xec> hi _Propheteus!
[05:05:53] <_Propheteus> can i get help on this code plz
[05:06:20] <xec> nobody knows!
[05:06:26] <_Propheteus> http://paste.laravel.com/MPf
[05:06:39] <xec> sorry, i'm in a weird mood
[05:06:56] <doug65536> _Propheteus: don't pass empty strings to getElementById?
[05:06:56] <_Propheteus> no worries xec no worries :)
[05:07:12] <xec> _Propheteus: what does the calling code look like?
[05:07:33] <_Propheteus> doug65536: i dont even know wich one is triggering that error, when i click somewhere in any page it keep yelling me that
[05:07:37] <xec> like, if you break on errors and step out to the code you've written
[05:07:48] <xec> or give us a url
[05:08:00] <_Propheteus> unfortunatly it's localhost
[05:08:17] <doug65536> _Propheteus: my 1st guess is you have a selector that looks like $('#')
[05:08:39] <_Propheteus> doug65536: gonna check for that right now :)
[05:09:47] <xec> jquery isn't that dumb, passing "#" as a selector just returns an empty set
[05:09:52] <xec> afaik
[05:10:06] <doug65536> yeah, just tried it. empty set
[05:10:50] <_Propheteus> i dont have $('#') :/
[05:11:07] <Cork> _Propheteus: put a breakpoint with a check for the error
[05:11:07] <xec> _Propheteus: do you know what i meant by "step out" earlier?
[05:11:10] <doug65536> _Propheteus: you have chrome?
[05:11:17] <Cork> and then back step out to where it comes from
[05:11:25] <_Propheteus> i'm at work, i works on safari
[05:11:31] <_Propheteus> i miss the dev tool in chrome
[05:11:42] <xec> there are dev tools in safari too
[05:11:50] <xec> but you need to enable it, under advanced or something
[05:11:54] <xec> in the preferences
[05:12:12] <xec> called "developer menu" iirc
[05:12:19] <_Propheteus> yeah i know xec but i'm behind a proxy and cannot install the pluggin for that :(
[05:12:25] <xec> there's no plugin
[05:12:35] <xec> it's part of safari
[05:12:49] <doug65536> _Propheteus: sounds like your network admin needs a hug
[05:12:49] <_Propheteus> did i said safari ? i mean firefox
[05:12:53] <_Propheteus> what dumb i am
[05:13:13] <_Propheteus> doug65536: yeah lol i'll pass on that :p
[05:13:22] <xec> ah, well, download chrome then? it doesnt need admin rights i think
[05:13:44] <_Propheteus> i does xec, i tried :)
[05:13:53] <_Propheteus> life sux lol
[05:14:10] <xec> upload your page somewhere?
[05:14:26] <xec> short of that, there's little we can do i'm afraid
[05:14:48] <doug65536> you could hook into jquery and trace out every selector used...
[05:14:49] <xec> if you know what part bugs, you can paste at jsfiddle.net for instance
[05:14:49] <_Propheteus> i know xec, i'm asking something that you cannot even see and i ask for help
[05:15:40] <_Propheteus> i'll be right back
[05:15:53] <_Propheteus> thx xec and doug65536 :)
[05:16:14] <xec> no love for Cork? :(
[05:16:36] * xec hugs Cork
[05:16:42] <Cork> <_< heh
[05:16:59] <seutje> http://www.loveincork.com/
[05:17:11] <xec> lol what the hell
[05:17:13] <seutje> love *in* Cork o.O
[05:17:30] <Cork> ya, lots of love in me
[05:17:31] <doug65536> selector trace http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/55L26/
[05:17:51] <seutje> Cork: the trick is getting it out :P
[05:17:57] <Cork> :)
[05:18:23] <Cork> doug65536: your better overriding .find
[05:18:33] <Cork> as it is what all the selectors goes though
[05:18:38] <xec> you're* better off*
[05:18:41] <doug65536> $.fn.find ?
[05:18:43] <Cork> yes
[05:18:43] <doug65536> ok, yeah
[05:19:10] <xec> seutje: isn't that what corkscrews are for?
[05:19:17] <Cork> lol
[05:19:18] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/55L26/1/
[05:19:27] <seutje> xec: RIMSHOT!
[05:20:09] <seutje> although one might argue that a corkscrew gets the cork out of the love instead of vice versa
[05:20:23] <xec> yeah it doesnt really work
[05:20:35] <seutje> maybe the corkscrew is broken?
[05:20:38] <xec> you get the "love" out of the bottle though
[05:20:43] <xec> by removing the cork :/
[05:20:45] <Cork> but it does get me out of a tight position!
[05:20:50] <xec> lol
[05:20:56] <xec> nice one
[05:21:25] <xec> you also get screwed, unfortunately
[05:21:26] <seutje> dipping ur ankles for years until finally! stabbed in the skull and pulled to elongation
[05:21:40] <doug65536> lol, I hadn't made that connection before. I assume Cork doesn't smell like wine all the time though :)
[05:21:42] <Cork> xec: well you can argue if that's a good or bad thing ;P
[05:21:47] <xec> true
[05:21:50] <seutje> with a little luck, u'll break and ruin it for everyone involved
[05:22:11] <seutje> leaving everyone with a bitter taste in their mouth
[05:22:29] <Cork> doug65536: i used to have all kind of cork response scripts in my irc client :)
[05:23:06] <Cork> hides in fear, when someone says "corkscrew" or corks up the channel and what not
[05:23:19] <Cork> back in my mirc days :)
[05:23:28] * xec still runs mirc
[05:23:34] <doug65536> my alias has the nice side effect of making people actually call me by my name. I do get kids complaining about digits in my name in games though. not sure how the idiotic fad of complaining about numbers in names got started
[05:23:48] <xec> although my awesome scripts are long gone

[05:31:28] <doug65536> if you get the "page has hung" warning, pick wait. it finishes... eventually
[05:34:07] <Cork> doug65536: modifying strings really costly
[05:34:20] <doug65536> yeah right
[05:34:40] <Cork> yes, cause to reduce memory usage, they generate a new full string every time
[05:34:54] <doug65536> if you mean a crap implementation that copies the whole thing to a new string at every modification, the sure O(n^2) is costly
[05:34:57] <Cork> else you would get memory fragmentation problems
[05:35:10] <Cork> doug65536: yes, that is what i mean
[05:35:42] <Cork> doug65536: and the alternative is to risk having large memory sections just sitting around for no reason
[05:36:15] <Muhyee> Hey all
[05:36:24] <doug65536> ah, but my CPU has 12MB L3, and it runs @ 3.46GHz, and 65536^2 ~= 4 billion, explain how it takes 30 seconds?
[05:36:54] <Cork> doug65536: i suspect gc is a large part of it
[05:37:11] <Cork> doug65536: try replacing it with an array where you join them when your done
[05:37:29] <Muhyee> Here is one for you...i have a popup div with multiple divs inside...I want to close the popup if user dont click on any of the children divs!
[05:37:30] <doug65536> array is awful in chrome too, but I'll try it
[05:38:09] <doug65536> Cork: that's instant
[05:39:30] <doug65536> Cork: you don't need "large sections of memory". you need to expand the memory in increments so it won't realloc/copy every single time. that causes it to bang on the gc since 1st gen will fill up rapidly/repeatedly
[05:40:08] <Cork> doug65536: that doesn't work for js
[05:40:36] <doug65536> there's no reason the implementation has to do it with a naive algorithm
[05:41:13] <Cork> doug65536: if you allocate them in one int (unicode 16) you would have a string not in sequence
[05:42:00] <Cork> doug65536: there is a reason why most modern language doesn't allow string manipulation
[05:42:32] <dan2k3k4> ok so parsing xml using 'css queries' works well except when I need to get the attribute value of the 'top level node'
[05:42:56] <dan2k3k4> I do a search for a node named 'scene' -> but then I need to get that nodes' attribute for 'data-id'
[05:42:58] <Cork> dan2k3k4:  $(xml).attr()
[05:43:05] <dan2k3k4> ah so not .find()?
[05:43:18] <dan2k3k4> I was doing .find([data-id])
[05:43:18] <Cork> attr is to get the attribute on an element
[05:43:34] <dan2k3k4> find(sub_node[attribute]) works fine
[05:43:42] <dan2k3k4> k thanks again Cork
[05:43:47] <[E]sc> i'm trying to get information data i've inserted in the last li in a ul li, I can get the li:first, but li:last is returned undefined. any suggestions? li:last-child does not work either.
[05:43:47] <Cork> dan2k3k4:  $(xml).find('sene').attr('data-id')
[05:44:11] <Cork> dan2k3k4: yes, but that get's you the element with the attribute
[05:44:24] <Cork> dan2k3k4: if you want the attribute value you use attr
[05:45:10] <Cork> dan2k3k4: xpath and xml document sees attribute as a second set of children
[05:45:21] <Cork> dan2k3k4: that's not how html dom or css sees it
[05:45:36] <Cork> there the attribute is directly on the element they belong to
[05:46:04] <hnsr> I want to dynamically append an element to a static element like so: "$('#messages').append('<p>my message</p>');". and after some timeout I want to remove the appended element again - but in the timeout callback I am not sure how to get a handle to the added element, is there an easy way to do that other than having to use a unique ID on each message I append?
[05:46:34] <dan2k3k4> and if I have an array with 2 objects that have 2 key-values, that I iterate over, should I do array[i].key or array[i][key] ?
[05:46:47] <dan2k3k4> (I know the key that I want to get the value for)
[05:47:09] <doug65536> hnsr: append returns the added element
[05:47:26] <doug65536> hnsr: wait, actually no
[05:47:27] <Cork> dan2k3k4: depends on what you want to do, .each(function() { $(this).attr() }) is one option
[05:47:34] <hnsr> doug65536, oh, ah :P
[05:47:39] <Cork> dan2k3k4: alternatively you can do .eq(num).attr()
[05:47:56] <dan2k3k4> eq(num) ? equals(typeof number) ?
[05:49:03] <Cork> dan2k3k4: no it grabs the element matching the index (num)
[05:49:21] <dan2k3k4> the array would have something like: [{sceneID: 1, resultCount: 3}, {sceneID: 2, resultCount: 0}]
[05:49:28] <doug65536> hnsr: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Aav32/
[05:49:37] <Cork> ah, ok so it isn't jquery results
[05:49:54] <dan2k3k4> neg
[05:50:08] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you could build a selector from it, or use .filter
[05:50:11] <hnsr> doug65536, thanks!
[05:50:14] <dan2k3k4> I could probably refactor the code I've done given what you've mentioned but for now I understand this way a littler better
[05:50:17] <dan2k3k4> little*
[05:58:25] <blandzi> hi
[05:58:36] <blandzi> I have problem with wrapping single number
[05:58:49] <blandzi> I have html code like http://pastebin.com/64Ucv7uP
[05:59:05] <blandzi> and I want wrap '3' in <a>
[05:59:16] <blandzi> any idea how to do that?
[06:00:56] <Cork> blandzi: serialize the content of pagination and regex replace the number
[06:01:01] <Cork> then parse everything back to dom
[06:03:51] <blandzi> but in place where is number '3' there can be any other number/letter/sentence
[06:05:03] <blandzi> is it possible to do it easier and 	
[06:05:03] <blandzi> irrespective of
[06:05:03] <blandzi> 	
[06:05:12] <blandzi> number/letter
[06:05:42] <Cork> blandzi: the problem comes from dom not really identifying text
[06:05:52] <doug65536> .wrap
[06:05:57] <seutje> clone it, remove the children and grab the remaining html?
[06:06:00] <Cork> doug65536: but for what?
[06:06:23] <Cork> seutje: hmm that might work, but it will be hard getting the new element in the correct place
[06:06:33] <doug65536> ah sorry I didn't look at paste
[06:06:38] <mikecmpbll> rofl
[06:07:20] <seutje> yeah
[06:08:16] <Cork> var p = $('.pagination'); var current = p.clone(); current.children().remove(); p.children().eq(2).after($('<a/>').text(current.text()));
[06:08:21] <Cork> something like that might work
[06:08:30] <Cork> though it would be fragile
[06:08:32] <seutje> magic numbers :P
[06:08:35] <Cork> ya
[06:08:50] <Cork> blandzi: really you are better of adding something around the number server side
[06:13:42] <limpc> hi, how do i force a html5 error validator message to appear?  I'm doing a manual validation (iterating through $('#myform :input:visible')), but although (!this.validity.valid || !this.validity.valueMissing) detects whether a field is valid, i cant seem to trigger the notice you usually get with html5 forms
[06:14:15] <Cork> limpc: html form validation errors can't be faked
[06:14:29] <limpc> i dont want to fake it, just trigger it
[06:14:37] <Cork> that is faking it
[06:21:18] <mikecmpbll> blandzi ^might just be easier to regex it, if changing the html isn't an option
[06:22:14] <intellix> when documenting code, what do you specify for the parameter of a jQuery DOM element?
[06:22:39] <intellix> I mean, when a parameter of a function is a jQuery DOM Element
[06:28:00] <imgrey> $.mobile.changePage( "#myDialog", { role: "dialog" } );
[06:28:04] <imgrey> why that does not work ?
[06:28:17] <imgrey> I append dialog contents to page with javascript
[06:30:21] <doug65536> imgrey: try $(..page selector..).trigger('create') should do it (do it after you add the new stuff to the page)
[06:30:54] <doug65536> imgrey: or on a selector that is a parent of where you added stuff
[06:32:55] <doug65536> intellix: jquery documentaton uses (jQuery object). see http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:33:03] <intellix> cheers big ears
[06:34:03] <imgrey> doug65536, does not work : (
[06:34:50] <doug65536> imgrey: you add content to a dialog?
[06:35:28] <imgrey> doug65536, http://pastie.org/8283411
[06:35:30] <imgrey> doug65536, yes
[06:37:49] <blandzi> Cork: thanks for help, I changed a little yours answer and now all works properly
[06:38:44] <imgrey> doug65536, I added $(): $.mobile.changePage($("#search-menu"), { role: "dialog" });
[06:38:57] <imgrey> and now it opens blank page in new window
[06:39:05] <imgrey> URL: #&ui-state=dialog
[06:39:35] <doug65536> imgrey: what do you add?
[06:40:09] <doug65536> imgrey: in this test it styles it by itself http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B6pmJ/
[06:41:26] <doug65536> imgrey: ah sorry. I was thinking jq ui, not jqm

[06:43:31] <pt> anyhelp?
[06:43:50] <doug65536> imgrey: this seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B6pmJ/3/
[06:43:56] <doug65536> imgrey: am I off track?
[06:45:06] <imgrey> doug65536, I'm trying to display dialog when user clicks button
[06:45:09] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B6pmJ/4/
[06:45:27] <imgrey> doug65536, when I add dialog to page body, it displayed on page load
[06:45:36] <imgrey> and I need to display it only when user clicks on link
[06:47:02] <doug65536> imgrey: it's kind of awful to plaster your js with that huge chunk of html isn't it?
[06:47:31] <doug65536> imgrey: is what you really want to put it in the html then show it from code?
[06:47:36] <imgrey> doug65536, yeah, but all other methods failed
[06:47:45] <imgrey> doublerebel, yes
[06:55:31] <doug65536> imgrey: this works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B6pmJ/9/
[06:57:02] <doug65536> imgrey: I think you need to make the dialog a page
[06:58:00] <imgrey> doug65536, when I assign data-role="page" attribute to div with my content, I receive blank page
[06:58:10] <imgrey> with no content shown in it
[06:58:52] <doug65536> that's what my fiddle was doing
[06:58:57] <imgrey> oh, when I remove dialog div, content appears
[06:59:00] <doug65536> whole page becomes dark gray
[06:59:39] <doug65536> imgrey: yes, I think the role: 'dialog' in the changePage call makes it act as a dialog
[06:59:48] <rethus> how can i catch "click, mouseover and mouseout" on an li in one command
[07:00:13] <rethus> now i only have: $('.langSwitch').click(function(){
[07:00:27] <doug65536> rethus: $('li').on('click mouseover mouseout', function() ...
[07:00:37] <rethus> cool, thanks
[07:00:59] <imgrey> doug65536, btw, example on jsfiddle does not work with jquery 1.9.1 ( my version )
[07:04:10] <gerep> Hi all. I'm using datatables and I have it's configuration already defined. I need to add another configuration to it, how can I do that? https://gist.github.com/gerep/6390189
[07:04:33] <imgrey> doug65536, http://jsfiddle.net/B6pmJ/10/
[07:04:38] <gerep> It will be added via ajax request
[07:05:06] <gerep> So when I make a request I'll generate a JSON an I need my dataTable to render it
[07:05:33] <doug65536> imgrey: your fiddle doesn't include jqm
[07:06:04] <imgrey> doug65536, right. fixed
[07:06:32] <imgrey> now it do the same as in my application: displays empty page
[07:07:04] <inspiral> hey guys, I have this javascript which works in the fiddle, but on the page i am trying it it does not account for a delay in the image loading so upon a hard refresh the height is counted as '0' rather than the actual height of the image
[07:07:05] <inspiral> http://jsfiddle.net/reF88/1/
[07:07:19] <doug65536> imgrey: that version of jqm crashes
[07:07:25] <inspiral> it works when soft refreshing so the image is alreach cached
[07:07:28] <inspiral> already*
[07:07:31] <doug65536> imgrey: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[07:07:47] <alexr2> inspiral, use an image preloader to load the images ni before the javascript runs
[07:08:08] <imgrey> doug65536, weird. works here
[07:08:09] <inspiral> any suggestions ?
[07:08:14] <inspiral> for an image preloader i mean
[07:08:17] <doug65536> imgrey: what version of jqm?
[07:08:49] <imgrey> doug65536, jQuery Mobile 1.3.0b1
[07:09:10] <imgrey> doug65536, btw, when I close dialog, it display only contents of my second "page"
[07:09:11] <doug65536> imgrey: ok that one doesn't crash
[07:09:18] <imgrey> without headers, defined outside
[07:10:15] <alexr2> inspiral, I forget the one that i normally use
[07:10:53] <doug65536> imgrey: how do you close it?
[07:11:13] <doug65536> imgrey: do you changePage back to other one?
[07:15:58] <doug65536> imgrey: sorry, this problem is far beyond my knowledge of jqm
[07:16:11] <doug65536> imgrey: stuff like this is why I don't use it
[07:16:23] <imgrey> doug65536, what changePage do ?
[07:16:42] <imgrey> doug65536, thank you anyway
[07:16:43] <doug65536> imgrey: $.mobile.changePage ?
[07:16:49] <imgrey> doug65536, yes
[07:17:24] <doug65536> imgrey: I guessed that if you changePage back to the other one after closing the dialog it might help
[07:26:10] <dangerousdave> noob question I am sure, how do I replace "placeholder" with the contents of my "path" variable please? http://pastie.org/8283566
[07:26:28] <dangerousdave> concatenation with a + is not working
[07:31:21] <slax0r> $('<img id="image" alt="" src="'+path+'">').insertAfter('div#lightbox a.close');
[07:31:22] <slax0r> ?
[07:31:27] <doug65536> dangerousdave: why do that at all? $('<img id="image" alt="">').attr('src', my_src).insertAfter('div#lightbox a.close');
[07:32:05] <slax0r> or even better: img#image as the selector...
[07:32:36] <dangerousdave> nice, thanks!
[07:36:27] <jedimind> why do img#image ?
[07:36:30] <jedimind> #image is faster
[07:36:40] <jedimind> since it's an ID only one will exist anyway
[07:42:05] <doug65536> jedimind: what? he's inserting it after an 'a' tag with class 'close' that is a child of #lightbox
[07:42:30] <jedimind> i was talking to slax0r who was the person who said img#image .
[07:42:40] <doug65536> jedimind: oh ok
[07:46:18] <slax0r> jedimind, yeah, like we've never seen IDs reused by some devs
[07:46:43] <jedimind> so instead of getting them to write not shitty code, this is the solution?
[07:46:55] <jedimind> or in fact code that doesnt validate
[07:49:01] <slax0r> if people don't understand the concept of an ID, it's not my problem...
[07:50:19] <dangerousdave> using just the id now
[07:50:39] <Krambiorix> hi, is it possible to get all elements with class "myclass" that are currently hidden?
[07:52:45] <doug65536> Krambiorix: $('myclass:hidden') should do it
[07:52:48] <doug65536> oops
[07:52:51] <doug65536> Krambiorix: $('.myclass:hidden') should do it
[07:53:49] <Krambiorix> doug65536, i tried that but   $('myclass:hidden').length  is 2854 and $('myclass').length is 287 ...
[07:54:14] <doug65536> Krambiorix: dot is missing
[07:54:19] <doug65536> Krambiorix: typo?
[07:54:32] <Krambiorix> doug65536,  dot is in my code
[07:54:46] <doug65536> Krambiorix: if that really doesn't work, try $('.myclass').filter(':hidden')
[07:55:18] <Krambiorix> doug65536, jquery doesn't like me
[07:55:39] <Krambiorix> doug65536, filter() works!
[07:55:42] <Krambiorix> doug65536, thanks man!
[07:55:48] <doug65536> Krambiorix: np
[08:01:37] <Tingle> Hi, I use this jqtransform plugin to modify how form items look like and I'
[08:01:39] <Tingle> ..
[08:01:56] <Tingle> I'm currently using it to modify a SELECT dropdown menu.
[08:02:20] <Tingle> thats works fine, but I want to modify how the scrollbar looks inside the dropdown menu, and to do that I have been trying to integrate jscrollpane
[08:02:27] <Tingle> but I cant get it to work
[08:02:37] <kev> hi
[08:03:14] <Tingle> ive tried applying it to the ul of the dropdowns list and wrapping that ul with a div and applying the jscrollpane to that, but both result in the dropdown menu not appearing/breaking
[08:03:53] <Tingle> anyone have an idea what I need to do to make jscrollpane (custom scrollbar) work with jqtransform select/dropdown item?
[08:05:39] <dangerousdave> I have been using insertafter() which works fine, however if the user clicks the thumnail image multiple times, multiple blocks of the same code get inserted, as one would expect. How would I go about adding the html only on the first click?
[08:07:42] <kev5> BillCriswell - hi
[08:07:46] <BillCriswell> ayyyyyyy
[08:07:52] <kev5> :-)
[08:08:11] <kev5> Remember our datepicker chat yesterday
[08:08:20] <doonie> eyyy
[08:08:31] <BillCriswell> ayyyy Mr. K.
[08:08:38] <BillCriswell> kev5: Yes.
[08:09:34] <kev5> well .... todays problem - managed to add the extra html, but when you page / select a new month - it scraps the extra html.
[08:09:45] <dangerousdave> figured it out
[08:10:01] <kev5> fancy taking up the challenge ?
[08:10:08] <kev5> mr b
[08:13:10] <kev5> BillCriswell: You up for the challenge? ^
[08:14:48] <BillCriswell> kev5: Not in particular. I'm thinking the CSS option I suggested at first could help in this situation though?
[08:14:55] <Tingle> does anyone know how to make jScrollPane work on a jq dropdown menu (jqtransform)?
[08:15:12] <Tingle> jScrollPane is to modify scrollbars
[08:15:40] <kev5> BillCriswell: Not to worry - recognise anyone else here with the expertise ?
[08:16:05] <BillCriswell> kev5: I'd just ask in general. Lots of smart people in here.
[08:17:19] <kev5> OK - here goes - who can help with Datepicker UI events etc ??
[08:17:31] <kev5> That should get some takers eh?
[08:22:35] <kev5> All - trying to modify the Datepicker UI - does anyone know how to modify / extend a function within (_updateDatepicker: function(inst) ........)
[08:22:47] <BillCriswell> kev5: For best results I'd link right to an example with a clear description of what the problem is.
[08:22:59] <kev5> OK
[08:27:24] <kev5> So about this datePicker UI - http://www.visitfyldecoast.info/jquery/
[08:27:46] <kev5> The appended scroll bar allows the time to be entered - works great
[08:28:09] <kev5> except when you change month / next / prev / or year
[08:28:29] <kev5> the function that that calls - rebuilds the html
[08:28:59] <kev5> I dont get chance to copy the slider html outside and reapply
[08:29:49] <kev5> Seems to be trashed by _updateDatepicker: function(inst)
[08:30:13] <kev5> All you smart guys step forward for the challenge !
[08:36:52] <kev5> http://us.123rf.com/450wm/limbi007/limbi0071303/limbi007130300033/18278465-orange-cartoon-character-with-sheet-of-paper-and-text-help-me.jpg
[08:36:53] <Krambiorix> is it possible to get all divs with a class name that starts with 1 ?
[08:39:22] <kev5> $('div[class*="1"]')
[08:39:37] <kev5> Krambiorix ^
[08:39:55] <Krambiorix> thanks kev5
[08:41:12] <kev5> $('div[class^="1"]')   - sorry previous was 'contains' checkout selectors in the documentation
[08:41:35] <kev5> this one is - begins with
[08:43:19] <kev5> datePicker UI help needed - Example - http://www.visitfyldecoast.info/jquery/
[08:43:41] <kev5> see comments above.
[08:44:12] <kev5> Just off for 'T' I challenge you to fix it b4 I get back :-)
[08:53:52] <Krambiorix> kev5,  and all divs with an id of 2 numbers and classname "myclass" ?
[09:01:47] <Krambiorix> anyone? get  all divs with an id of 2 numbers and classname "myclass" ?
[09:03:59] <grafi> an id of 2 numbers? so like 10-99?
[09:04:06] <grafi> kev5 http://jsfiddle.net/hKcTL/ ?!
[09:09:04] <grafi> Krambiorix [18:04:08] <grafi> an id of 2 numbers? so like 10-99?
[09:14:23] <BillCriswell> Can running selectors on an element affect the DOM? I'm having the weirdest issue right now.
[09:14:42] <BillCriswell> Nevermind. I'm a fucking idiot.
[09:15:13] <grafi> Was just about to suggest that solution BillCriswell :P
[09:15:37] <BillCriswell> grafi: Usually the case.
[09:16:08] <grafi> Yeah
[09:16:10] <BillCriswell> I was running $('.ProductAddToCart texarea') with no luck but $('.ProductAddToCart .DetailRow .Value textarea') was working.
[09:16:36] <grafi> what a nice selector
[09:16:37] <grafi> ^^
[09:17:00] <BillCriswell> It sucks having to work around HTML you can't change.
[09:17:08] <Krambiorix> grafi, yes
[09:17:49] <Krambiorix> grafi and id of 2 numbers and a classname "myclass" -> is that possible?
[09:18:21] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: you'd have to first grab the element with .myclass, and then loop to find the ID based on a regex
[09:18:22] <grafi> i think ids starting with numbers is not valid html
[09:18:33] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: not very efficient, why not give them a new class if you can?
[09:18:38] <grafi> Krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/YDNrB/
[09:18:58] <jcooper_> given this html how could i select the 2ND a tag
[09:18:59] <jcooper_> <span id="ctl00_breadcrumbContent"><span><a href="/">Home</a></span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span><a href="/vases.aspx">Vases</a></span>
[09:19:23] <Krambiorix> nice , thanks grafi!
[09:19:42] <grafi> Never gonna give you up
[09:19:46] <grafi> Never gonna let you down
[09:19:47] <grafi> ^^
[09:19:50] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, hmmm, they are not used to calculate things... They are just unique
[09:19:55] <Krambiorix> grafi, how romantic
[09:20:02] <Krambiorix> grafi, i know that song
[09:20:11] <Krambiorix> 80's song, right?
[09:20:47] <jcooper_> does anyone know?
[09:21:24] <Krambiorix> jcooper_, grafi i think Rick Astley or something
[09:22:02] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: whats the second tag?
[09:22:14] <jcooper_> <a href="/vases
[09:22:56] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: do you always want that "a" tag, or do you always want the "2nd" tag?
[09:23:03] <jcooper_> i always want the 2nd
[09:23:10] <jcooper_> first will always be Home
[09:25:08] <jcooper_> NoiseEee, do you have any idea
[09:26:20] <NoiseEee> $('#ctl00_breadcrumbContent').find('*:eq(1)');
[09:26:27] <grafi> :D
[09:26:41] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: understand whats happening
[09:26:42] <NoiseEee> ?
[09:26:53] <grafi> NoiseEee wont all the spans interfere with that?
[09:26:54] <jcooper_> sort of
[09:27:11] <jcooper_> not really
[09:27:24] <jcooper_> i had tried $('#ctl00_breadcrumbContent a:eq(2)')
[09:27:29] <jcooper_> let me try
[09:28:06] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: you said the 2nd element always; dont' confine it to a:eq(2)
[09:28:12] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: unless you want the 2nd <a> tag
[09:28:17] <grafi> xD
[09:28:20] <jcooper_> yes i want the a
[09:28:50] <NoiseEee> well perhaps next time ask a clearer question, but you should have enough to get going there
[09:29:06] <jcooper_> its not working :/
[09:29:08] <grafi> damn fresh out of new media to consume ._.
[09:29:19] <jcooper_> $('#ctl00_breadcrumbContent').find('a:eq(2)').html(); alerts nothing
[09:29:43] <grafi> alert, *cringe*
[09:30:31] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: sigh
[09:30:37] <jcooper_> i did ask a clear question
[09:30:37] <grafi> jcooper_ i think eq is 0-based so you are actually trying to find a third "a"
[09:30:44] <NoiseEee> that, for one
[09:30:49] <jcooper_> you are just bad at getting me the answer :D
[09:30:52] <jcooper_> hehe
[09:31:03] <grafi> ...
[09:31:16] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: what you want is the first <a> then, isnt it?
[09:31:20] <NoiseEee> ie: nothing to do with a "2nd child" at all
[09:31:45] <jcooper_> there are two a's within the div
[09:31:47] <jcooper_> i want the second one
[09:32:15] <NoiseEee> so we'll leave you to figure out with number to put in eq() based upon my example and grafi's comment.
[09:32:32] <jcooper_> it doesnt work :/
[09:32:38] <grafi> it does
[09:32:38] <jcooper_> it might be becdause im using jquery 1.7
[09:32:39] <grafi> :)
[09:33:06] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: prolly got the wrong number then.
[09:33:09] <NoiseEee> so we'll leave you to figure out with number to put in eq() based upon my example and grafi's comment.
[09:33:38] <NoiseEee> (and your restriction to the <a> tags within your parent)
[09:34:57] <jcooper_> well this does not work and im at a loss
[09:35:03] <jcooper_> var moo = $('#ctl00_breadcrumbContent a').find('*:eq(1)').html(); alert(moo);
[09:35:29] <jcooper_> ill search s.o
[09:36:06] <NoiseEee> jcooper_: $('#ctl00_breadcrumbContent').find('a:eq(1)');
[09:36:08] <NoiseEee> GAH
[09:36:11] * NoiseEee shoots self
[09:36:15] <NoiseEee> good luck
[09:36:20] <jcooper_> haha thanks
[09:36:24] <jcooper_> i did try that tho
[09:39:13] <petey> So html5boilerplate includes a link to jquery but for some reason I get an error in devtools that says its missing?
[09:39:19] <petey> because I'm using // instead of https://
[09:44:20] <jcooper_> im very confused
[09:45:19] <jcooper_> im a retard, i apologize
[09:45:26] <jcooper_> it was because i didnt wrap it in document.ready
[09:45:41] <jcooper_> thanks for giving me the answer
[09:46:13] <NoiseEee> happy friday jcooper_
[09:48:22] <Tingle> has anyone gotten jScrollPane to work with dropdown scrollbars that are created through other jqplugins like jqtransform
[09:49:25] <alcuadrado> I have to submit some data via ajax, and some of the fields are files. how can I do this? firefox & chrome only is OK
[09:49:29] <spilliams> good morning! I think I have found a bug in jQuery-ui1.10.3 and I wanted a sanity check before I reported it
[09:50:15] <NoiseEee> alcuadrado: with xhr2 (google)
[09:50:42] <spobat> is there a show/hide method where only the height is animated?
[09:50:49] <spilliams> The minified js file contains an instance of "this.id="ui-id-"+ ++a", which gets shortened to "this.id="ui-id-"+++a" in Firefox 23
[09:51:23] <alcuadrado> thanks NoiseEee :D
[09:51:31] <alcuadrado> exactly the kind of answer I was looking for
[09:52:09] <spilliams> The corresponding code in the non-minified is "+ (++uuid)". Is it weird that this minifies to "+ ++a"?
[09:56:37] <alcuadrado> read it, thanks NoiseEee :D xhr2 <3
[09:56:48] <NoiseEee> np alcuadrado
[09:58:50] <spobat> hi
[09:58:57] <spobat> how can i create a fluent animation here?
[09:58:57] <spobat> http://jsfiddle.net/LANC8/
[09:59:21] <spobat> using show/hide is jiggling a lot
[09:59:37] <spobat> it first reserves some place and *then* starts the animation
[09:59:49] <spobat> the red div should smoothly animate big :)
[10:05:14] <spilliams> @spobat: try showing/hiding a parent element to the input
[10:05:15] <spilliams> http://jsfiddle.net/spilliams/LANC8/1/
[10:06:11] <spobat> ah, that's exactly what i wanted! thank you :)
[10:14:53] <Ericx2x> Hey can someone tell me why this java errors out?

[10:25:10] <kev5> grafi: Just back from T - checking out your solution thanks
[10:25:13] <raj> I have `$(document).on('click', function(){alert('hi')})` and it's not working when clicking within a particular div
[10:30:14] <spobat> why did it come to this effect spilliams?
[10:32:39] <Technical_13> How do I add "disabled" to textarea? It's an attribute that has no ="value"
[10:32:52] <grafi> it has
[10:32:57] <grafi> disabled="disabled"
[10:33:05] <Technical_13> Ahh. Ok
[10:33:31] <Technical_13> w3schools doesn't mention that..
[10:33:42] <kev5> readonly?

[10:34:13] <Technical_13> Same thing kev5 I assume
[10:34:21] <Technical_13> Lol
[10:34:24] <spobat> why in gods name has the top selector a higher priority than the one at the bottom? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-30%20at%207.32.58%20PM.png
[10:34:24] <spobat> *it is the blank id*! Nothing has a higher prio than the blank id
[10:34:35] <kev5> grafi: You are really are a smart guy - tested the code you sent for datetime - works perfectly!
[10:34:53] <kev5> just catching up :-)
[10:35:51] <fission6> how do i hide something, but not let the height change
[10:36:03] <fission6> sort of like hold the position but not display
[10:37:21] <spobat> fission6: display:none
[10:37:25] <Technical_13> Hrmmm.
[10:37:29] <spobat> :3
[10:37:34] <spobat> opacity: 0
[10:37:46] <kev5> grafi: That's the second time I have seen setTimeout used to wait for content to be available - what's the idea behind it ??
[10:37:47] <spobat> visibility: hidden
[10:37:55] * Technical_13 has wanted to start a new MediaWiki wiki...
[10:38:00] <fission6> is there a short cut for that spobat ?
[10:38:03] <fission6> hide()
[10:38:05] <fission6> will collapse space
[10:38:15] <kev5> grafi: Last time it was delay 0 and still worked ??
[10:38:21] <spobat> fission6: unfortunately, there isn't :/
[10:38:26] <fission6> k
[10:38:29] <spobat> css('visibility', 'hidden');
[10:38:33] <fission6> also i am using attr("disabled", "disabled") for a button
[10:38:39] <grafi> i wonder if it would work without the timeout then
[10:38:43] <fission6> is there a way to remove :hover css
[10:38:54] <kev5> nope
[10:39:15] <Technical_13> w3.wikipedia.org

[10:40:17] <nicetry> Hey there - is it possible to create a custom event listener on something jquery isn't doing?  I want to know when a plugin inside TinyMCE recieves a response to an Ajax Post (specifically After The Deadline).  Is that just crazy or is it theoretically possible?
[10:41:07] <kev5> grafi: just reading ....
[10:41:16] <grafi> if you have a way to trigger the event nicetry
[10:41:58] <nicetry> I don't...except through a tinyMCE command which then calls another function which eventually makes the ajax call
[10:43:02] <grafi> hm
[10:43:16] <grafi> could still be possible, wouldnt know how though :P
[10:43:38] <kev5> grafi: all make perfect sense now - thanks
[10:43:44] <grafi> np
[10:48:29] <dcherman> nicetry: does that plugin use jquery or tinymce's xhr?  what does invoking the command return?  does it have any callbacks that you could hook into?
[10:48:47] <nicetry> dcherman: yes it does use xhr!
[10:49:00] <nicetry> tinymce.util.XHR.send
[10:49:34] <dcherman> nicetry: ok, that rules out using a jquery prefilter.  what about the other two questions?
[10:52:49] <nicetry> dcherman: as for ccallbacks to hook into - thats where I get lost. I really don't have a good idea about how jquerys event listening features work.  Upon success it passes the the results of the xhr to an anon function.  one sec
[10:53:19] <nicetry> dcherman: I found the code on github - this is what I'm looking at https://github.com/wp-plugins/after-the-deadline/blob/master/tinymce/editor_plugin.js#L118
[10:54:12] <nicetry> dcherman: which calls /passes a function to: https://github.com/wp-plugins/after-the-deadline/blob/master/tinymce/editor_plugin.js#L445
[10:55:12] <nicetry> btw the comments in this code are great: "/* create the nifty spinny thing that says "hizzo, I'm doing something fo realz" */"
[10:55:40] <grafi> xD
[10:55:47] <grafi> documentation at its finest
[10:56:02] <nicetry> later: " /* turn off the spinning thingie */"
[10:57:09] <nicetry> dhruvasagar: Anyway - it seems like everything is encapsulated in the plugin, so I'm struggling to get a read on its state from the outside (would like to not edit the src for AtD as much as possible)
[10:57:15] <dcherman> nicetry: without ever having used this plugin, i'd imagine you could do something like this - http://jsfiddle.net/kEGNb/
[10:57:51] <dcherman> although triggering events on `window` is meh.  a custom pubsub solution would be better - there's an implementation on jquery's site in the ?callbacks section
[10:58:17] <dcherman> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/#pubsub
[10:59:11] <nicetry> dcherman: I wish I could do a callback like that! but this is the doc for execCommand http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/API3:method.tinymce.execCommand
[11:00:53] <dcherman> nicetry: try tinymce.execCommand( "mceWritingImprovementTool", false, callback ).  the 3rd parameter is probably the callback.
[11:01:02] <dcherman> since that's the only value the command takes

[11:29:00] <naschurm_> hey guys
[11:30:45] <naschurm_> i'm connecting to an API, so i'm using jsonp in ajax function $.ajax. on the complete function, it throws "Uncaught ReferenceError: rj8v53pqn40bum9ac704spmd571377887109 is not defined", and that is the string that i actually need to capture, any thoughts?
[11:32:06] <NoiseEee> naschurm_: seems its being interpreted as a variable and not a string, ie: see about quotes?
[11:33:56] <naschurm_> solved it putting quotes on the server-side, now, when i log the data, it returns and xhr object, but with no data in it
[11:34:06] <naschurm_> is like it didn't capture the data
[11:34:31] <NoiseEee> not on the server side?
[11:34:58] <NoiseEee> naschurm_: its a JS error.  maybe pastebin your callback?

[12:02:13] <Anickyan> grafi, ?
[12:02:40] <grafi> afaik offset returns undefined for objects that hidden
[12:02:49] <grafi> like visibility: hidden or display: none
[12:04:07] <Anickyan> grafi, this is the CSS code: http://hastebin.com/hudetamaku.css
[12:04:53] <grafi> so it should probably work
[12:05:38] <grafi> i notice however that the css is for a class and you try to select by id, I guess the element has the id too then?
[12:06:14] <Anickyan> Yes.
[12:06:24] <Anickyan> Oh.
[12:06:35] <Anickyan> Apparently, the code was getting executed before the elements were loaded entirely.

[12:27:42] <grafi> button type button?
[12:27:53] <grafi> whats the type of buttons without type button?
[12:28:38] <mad_mode_on> I meant  <input type="button" id="myFancyButton" />

[12:29:34] <grafi> lucky guy
[12:29:35] <grafi> :P
[12:29:50] <mad_mode_on> I meant  <input type="button" id="myFancyButton" />
[12:30:45] <grafi> the hardest button to button oô
[12:31:26] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: why not use a <button>
[12:31:35] <grafi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLESpHrtvxs
[12:32:21] <NoiseEee> grafi: a <button> that does not specify "type='button'" will submit a form.
[12:32:42] <grafi> hm
[12:33:02] <NoiseEee> but all of this is because i'm guessing he doesn't want the enter key to submit the form
[12:33:20] <NoiseEee> if i'm wrong and he just wants to kill the enter key, its about capturing the key event and cancelling it @ mad_mode_on
[12:33:55] <mad_mode_on> NoiseEee: not the case. I have an <input type="text" /> and an <input type="button" /> within a <form>. The problem is not changing the button but the input in such a way it can't allow ENTER to perform as usual.
[12:33:59] <grafi> interesting that i never stumpled upon that ...
[12:34:24] <grafi> then again i rarely have buttons that are not supposed to submit forms i guess
[12:34:25] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: "as usual" meaning what?
[12:34:58] <NoiseEee> meaning you don't want the form to submit?1
[12:35:07] <mad_mode_on> NoiseEee: when you press ENTER just after editing the input text (without leaving it) then it submits the form viaGTE
[12:35:18] * NoiseEee sighs audibly
[12:36:02] <mad_mode_on> NoiseEee: meaning you're clueless ?
[12:37:00] <NoiseEee> its about capturing the key event and cancelling it @ mad_mode_on
[12:37:06] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/895171/prevent-users-from-submitting-form-by-hitting-enter has some approaches.

[13:16:14] <Technical_13> <input type="button" onClick="alert('message');">
[13:16:40] <Tumulte> cause I got an if/else into the on(click, class, function, and both are triggered !
[13:16:49] <Technical_13> Just a message telling me what is the value of a couple things.
[13:24:02] <Technical_13> Okay.. I got that it is .val() instead of .value()
[13:24:53] <Technical_13> But, I'm still having trouble with [name="foo"] not working as I expect
[13:26:31] <naschurm_> guys, do you know a good open source bug tracking system? :)
[13:29:06] <grafi> not mantis

[13:34:41] <grafi> Technical_13 you know that there is a syntax error?

[13:39:02] <Technical_13> ^^^ if I remove that it works... so, the issue is in there.
[13:40:22] <Technical_13> Is it because of the nested ' & " ?
[13:40:50] <grafi> that probably doesnt help
[13:41:00] <Technical_13> Escaping them didn't  work.
[13:41:05] <grafi> i find it hard to find out where it fails though
[13:41:19] <grafi> why arent you binding the events in the javascript?
[13:42:30] <Technical_13> Because it is temporary debuging code
[13:43:08] <Technical_13> There is another function it will end up calling later

[13:51:20] <guest___> hi i would like to output all array values (arrayname[num].obj) with a <br> so i have this code:  function outputValues(){ 		for (var i = 1; i < arrayname.length; i++) {   		 	$("#value_output").append(arrayname[i] + '<br>'); this code however does not work. Can anyone tell me how to fix it?
[13:51:52] <guest___> the function is called on click
[13:53:00] <Maoz> Hey, Could anyone please help me? I have a several rows like: <td my_attr="aaa">1</td><td my_attr="aaa">0</td>, I would like to get all the "td" that has [my_attr="aaa"] and their value is 1... what is the correct selector?
[13:53:20] <Technical_13> Removing the ' around Select_summary made the alert come up.
[13:53:51] <Technical_13> It's returning the wrong value, but I can get that.
[13:56:11] <guest___> @Maoz I would give the TDs a class(or another one if you have 1 already) and use that class as your selector
[13:57:28] <Maoz> ok, thanks guest___, but what if I would like to keep the same structure?
[13:57:50] <guest___> I am looking into that right now
[13:57:56] <Maoz> :) thanks
[13:59:53] <guest___> give this a try $( "[my_attr~='aaa']" )
[14:01:27] <Maoz> guest___, but what about the "1"?
[14:01:58] <guest___> oh sorry i didnt see that
[14:02:04] <guest___> one sec
[14:04:34] <guideX> is there some way for waiting for an asp.net updatepanel to complete in jquery? and then execute code at the end of the updatepanel completion?
[14:04:45] <guideX> I tried like ajaxComplete, but it isn't working
[14:04:48] <guest___> this can find the value of the cell $('tr').find('td:contains('1')'); but i dont know how to combine the two yet
[14:05:23] <Maoz> Thanks guest___
[14:06:21] <guest___> no problem but again if you would change "my_attr" to class you should beable to use $('.aaa.tr').find('td:contains('+cell+')');
[14:06:27] <guest___> (i think)
[14:06:49] <Technical_13> Got it.
[14:07:33] <guest___> change +cell+ to '1'
[14:08:05] <guest___> so can anybody help with my problem?
[14:08:10] <Technical_13> $( '[name=Select_summary]:checked' ).val() got what I wanted.
[14:23:01] <rpcesar> asked in jqm but not getting any replies there: Is it possible to control whether or not a select-menu opens up in a popup or an overlay? I am having some massive issues in a large existing codebase, when using it as a menu and binding javascript to it, due to the fact that it may or may not require waiting around for a page transition.
[14:26:38] <rpcesar> *crickets*
[14:27:56] <rpcesar> anyone? noone?
[14:59:54] <d0den> With HTML5 audio, if I want to get foo.currentTime how come using " var foo = document.getElementById("foo"); " works, but using " var foo = $('#foo'); " doesn't?
[15:02:51] <grafi> try var foo = $('#foo')[0] d0den
[15:05:44] <d0den> grafi, fantastic, that works. Thank you. What does the [0] do please?
[15:06:44] <grafi> gets you the "raw" dom element, $('#foo') gets you a jquery object thats holds the elements and some other stuff, so you dont have direct access to things like currentTime
[15:08:25] <d0den> great, thanks. It what kind of circumstance would things be the other way around? I.e. where things would work *without* [0] and *not* work with it?
[15:11:37] <grafi> well anything that uses jquery methods wont work without the jq object
[15:11:41] <grafi> obviously
[15:17:56] <majuscule> I thought variables were closed over in function definitions? I'm confused why this code outputs "2" instead of "0":
[15:18:01] <majuscule> >> fns = []; for (var i in [1,2,3]) { fns.push(function() { return i })  } fns[0]()
[15:18:17] <majuscule> whoops, sorry, meant to ask in #js
[15:21:59] <d0den> Given this code snippet, is there a way I can generalize it for variables other than foo and bar? I currently have it copy/pasted ten times with different variable name pairs in each function
[15:22:06] <d0den> http://pastebin.com/dptNxgCx
[15:22:48] <d0den> I think I need a function that takes in the variable name and inserts it where needed, but I don't know what that kind of function would look like
[15:23:27] <grafi> exactly like what you have?
[15:24:50] <grafi> http://pastebin.com/cG60ubDd
[15:26:30] <d0den> grafi, what I mean is that say I want the same timeupdate function to bind to baz and trigger qux and bind to axe and trigger kug and so forth, for a long list of triggers each triggering a different audio play
[15:27:11] <grafi> yeah
[15:27:45] <grafi> but i dont see the problem
[15:28:08] <grafi> you substitute the objects/values that change with variables you pass into the function
[15:28:15] <grafi> and your done
[15:31:12] <d0den> grafi, OK, thank you, I am trying very hard to understand. I realize I am being quite stupid
[15:31:33] <grafi> no worries
[15:58:55] <gry> How do I retrieve RSS to display it inside of a web page, using jQuery?
[16:00:45] <Sjee> Maybe: http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/
[16:09:27] <defaultro> what does max connection mean when we see it in http headers?
[16:23:12] <d0den> grafi, I apologize but I just don't get this even though you are explaining it patiently. If you have time, could you take one last look? This is the actual code, I just became more confused as I tried to substitute example var names. I just don't follow the mechanism of recycling the function: http://pastebin.com/GtP7VzcL
[16:30:10] <Whirl3d> when you perform a query using WP_Query()...is the content formatted? How do you declare how the content should be formatted and where?
[16:31:17] <grafi> d0den you still here? was afk for a while there, i can take a look in a sec
[16:32:37] <d0den> grafi, yes, thank you!
[16:36:41] <grafi> d0den so its looks like you have 3 "things" that change from function to function, the respective playerobjects and the time thingie
[16:36:56] <d0den> yes that's right
[16:40:05] <grafi> d0den http://pastebin.com/tyF8Fh2H so something like this should work
[16:40:49] <grafi> i've replaced the first 2 with the function call
[16:42:33] <d0den> grafi; I understand! Thanks so much for taking the time to explain this to me, I really appreciate it
[16:44:39] <grafi> no problem :)
[16:45:19] <d0den> ok, bed time for me. Thanks again, really was very kind of you to spend so much time with me

[16:49:40] <guideX> what do I do if the jquery qtip is appearing behind my popup
[16:50:19] <tw2113> fix the z-indexes on one of them
[16:50:46] <guideX> hmm
[16:51:01] <guideX> I did change the zindex, perhaps I haven't found the real offending zindex, i'll check again
[16:52:32] <grafi> devtools ftw
[16:53:32] <tw2113> make sure you specify a position attribute
[16:53:39] <tw2113> even if just "relative"
[16:53:49] <tw2113> it has to be set by the stylesheet instead of the browser defaults
[16:54:28] <guideX> hmm ok
[16:59:11] <guideX> hmm I don't get it.. it's always behind no matter what I do..
[16:59:17] <guideX> i'm using a fancybox with the qtip
[17:00:35] <guideX> it's like behind the overlay and popup
[17:00:41] <guideX> I can see it poking through the side
[17:00:44] <Saunt> hey there
[17:01:39] <Saunt> gotta question to you.. anybody there who know how to use Prototype and switch it to jQuery?
[17:02:51] <Saunt> nobody?
[17:03:24] <guideX> I haven't tried prototype
[17:03:51] <Saunt> hm ok^^
[17:04:06] <Saunt> seems there are not a lot awake at this time
[17:04:19] <guideX> what do you mean switch it to jquery?
[17:04:45] <guideX> the act of removing prototype and putting jquery seems easy enough, am I missing something
[17:04:46] <Saunt> i mean the source is different to jQuery and i dont know how to handle it
[17:05:19] <Saunt> no no i mean some code made for prototype
[17:05:25] <guideX> oic
[17:05:48] <Saunt> oh i see? :D
[17:06:05] <Saunt> dont know this proposal
[17:06:11] <guideX> well with jquery, it's pretty simple, $("#myid").hide(200);
[17:06:36] <Saunt> yeah but it's a little bit more difficult like that
[17:06:39] <Saunt> i show u what i mean
[17:06:41] <guideX> depends what you want to do really
[17:07:01] <Saunt> var Shoutbox = Class.create({ 	/** 	 * Inits Shoutbox. 	 *  	 * @param	string		shoutboxID 	 * @param	Hash		entries 	 */ 	initialize: function(shoutboxID, entries) { 		this.shoutboxID = shoutboxID; 		this.lastEntryID = 0; 		this.standby = false; 		this.options = Object.extend({ 			langDeleteEntry:	'', 			langDeleteEntrySure:	'', 			imgDeleteEntrySrc:	'', 			entryReloadInterval: 	0, 			entrySortOrder: 	'ASC', 			unneededUpdateLimit:	1 		
[17:07:10] <Saunt> this is just a quick overview
[17:07:18] <guideX> oh that's way different from jquery
[17:07:50] <guideX> I guess i don't know prototype well enoguh
[17:07:52] <Saunt> ya that's why i ask^^
[17:08:26] <Saunt> ugh but thanks for trying to help me
[17:08:26] <Saunt> ^^
[17:09:14] <defaultro> good afternoon folks, I'm having a hard time creating an 8 column div with a 100% height. The width should be width of browser div 8. It will also shrink when we resize the width of the browser. Here is my code, http://jsfiddle.net/tcaVN/767/
[17:09:46] <Saunt> hey there
[17:10:40] <Saunt> for which reason do you need that much columns in this order^^?
[17:14:05] <guest_______> hi i would like to output all array values (arrayname[num].obj) with a <br> so i have this code:  function outputValues(){ for (var i = 1; i < arrayname.length; i++) {   $("#value_output").append(arrayname[i] + '<br>'); this code however does not work. Can anyone tell me why?
[17:15:02] <defaultro> Saunt: I'm going to put pictures on each
[17:15:11] <defaultro> as an opening to my homepage
[17:15:58] <defaultro> Saunt: each column will expand to full if I hover on an area then go back to original size when mouse is out
[17:16:19] <Saunt> cool :D
[17:16:21] <defaultro> only 1 column expands per time
[17:16:39] <Saunt> just like an accordeon effect
[17:16:40] <defaultro> i thought it's cool but i couldn't figure out the css, lol
[17:16:46] <defaultro> i haven't seen accordion effect
[17:17:01] <defaultro> maybe, I don't have to recreate it. maybe someone has already written it
[17:17:26] <guest_______> defaultro: the css?
[17:17:26] <Saunt> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[17:17:47] <defaultro> guest_______: , yes, the css is only the cause why it's displaying it incorrectly
[17:18:00] <defaultro> but that's only to display it properly
[17:18:19] <defaultro> guest_______:  http://jsfiddle.net/tcaVN/767/
[17:18:25] <guest_______> have you tried this http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[17:19:39] <defaultro> looking
[17:19:48] <guest_______> ok
[17:20:12] <defaultro> different from what I am looking for
[17:20:20] <guest_______> I would help with your jsfiddle but i am not sure what you want
[17:20:23] <Saunt> yea your right..but thats nearly an accordion^^
[17:20:31] <defaultro> k
[17:20:55] <defaultro> guest_______: right now, I just want equal width of 8 columns on a full opened browser
[17:21:15] <defaultro> i don't want to use specific width of column like 200px
[17:21:26] <guest_______> I have done that before but I forget the code:(
[17:21:37] <defaultro> i want it dynamic so that when I resize the browser, the columns also shrinks
[17:21:59] <defaultro> I'm sure dreamweaver will help me, but I don't have it anymore. lol
[17:22:13] <guest_______> have you tried float with width xx%
[17:22:26] <guest_______> I have dreamweaver
[17:23:13] <defaultro> i haven't tried it yet
[17:23:21] <defaultro> will look for internet how to use it
[17:23:50] <guest_______> ok i am working on the fiddle
[17:24:06] <defaultro> i'll try too
[17:27:42] <royalty> hello
[17:27:52] <royalty> this selector doesn't seem to be working for me #tab-btns > li
[17:28:01] <royalty> #tab-btns is on a ul
[17:28:08] <royalty> ul#tab-btns li a
[17:28:21] <royalty> I want to select the as
[17:29:19] <hellojamiemorgan> hello. I'm looking to contribute to jquery, and I was wondering if anyone had some suggestions for basic bugs I might try fixing?
[17:30:24] <guest_______> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/tcaVN/768/ closer (i think)
[17:30:30] <defaultro> looking
[17:30:32] <defaultro> thanks
[17:30:37] <guest_______> yup
[17:30:44] <defaultro> yup
[17:30:49] <defaultro> awesome, I'll try to fix it :)
[17:31:05] <guest_______> ok if you need anything let me know
[17:34:42] <guest_______> hi i would like to output all array values (arrayname[num].obj) with a <br> so i have this code:  function outputValues(){ for (var i = 1; i < arrayname.length; i++) {   $("#value_output").append(arrayname[i] + '<br>'); this code however does not work. Can anyone tell me why?
[17:35:27] <shoky> guest_______: arrays are 0-based (the first index is 0)
[17:35:43] <guest_______> this one is set to start at 1
[17:36:33] <shoky> guest_______: make a jsfiddle showing your problem
[17:36:46] <guest_______> ok one second
[17:39:56] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/RdCT8/2/
[17:40:00] <royalty> what am I doing wrong?
[17:40:01] <doug65536> is bootstrap a jquery plugin? (if you exclude the css stuff)
[17:40:17] <guest_______> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/6yBM8/6/
[17:41:02] <guest_______> then i want to write the array later on
[17:41:44] <doug65536> guest_______: don't do that. put a data- prefix on custom attributes
[17:41:53] <doug65536> guest_______: then use .data('dis')
[17:42:33] <doug65536> guest_______: attribute names that begin with data- are reserved for custom attributes - they will never conflict and should always work
[17:42:45] <royalty> guest_______, http://jsfiddle.net/6yBM8/7/
[17:42:53] <royalty> that might be a little better
[17:42:54] <guest_______> ok one sec
[17:43:33] <royalty> anyone want to help with this simple one? http://jsfiddle.net/RdCT8/2/
[17:43:37] <shoky> guest_______: text_arr is not an array, it's an object
[17:43:51] <shoky> guest_______: so it doesn't have a .length  for example
[17:44:04] <doug65536> royalty: there is no $this variable
[17:44:23] <guest_______> that was just an example.
[17:44:34] <doug65536> royalty: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RdCT8/4/
[17:44:51] <shoky> guest_______: i asked you for a jsfiddle showing your problem
[17:45:05] <royalty> doug65536, thanks
[17:45:11] <royalty> doug65536, too much php lol
[17:45:19] <doug65536> royalty: :)
[17:47:58] <guest_______> here recoded to reflect more: http://jsfiddle.net/6yBM8/8/
[17:49:01] <shoky> guest_______: i told you, myArray is not an array, your loop is wrong
[17:49:17] <shoky> {} is an object, [] is an array
[17:49:18] <guest_______> how do i make it an array then?
[17:49:25] <guest_______> nvm
[17:49:41] <guest_______> how do i do that with the object then?
[17:50:07] <guest_______> I need two objects stored in the array/object thing
[17:50:10] <shoky> for both cases you could use $.each  or $.map
[17:50:35] <shoky> or a for..in loop for the object, if you wanted to
[17:51:19] <guest_______> could i use $("#output").append(myObject[numDis].name + '<br>') in the click function?
[17:52:39] <guest_______> shoky?
[17:53:05] <doug65536> guest_______: what is 'dis' for?
[17:53:36] <guest_______> its a way to give me a number predefind in html and use in js
[17:53:50] <doug65536> guest_______: something wrong with the id?
[17:54:21] <guest_______> i needed pure number not 'text1'
[17:54:56] <doug65536> guest_______: what is the code trying to accomplish? an array of all of the 'old' values?
[17:55:10] <guest_______> if it is not in the way of anything I would prefer to keep it as to not rewrite all my code
[17:55:25] <guest_______> it is supposed to store for later use
[17:56:18] <doug65536> guest_______: so the '1' is there for no purpose other than you want it there
[17:56:28] <guest_______> kind of
[17:56:49] <guest_______> part of my other code does rely on it
[17:57:19] <guest_______> I just need a way to print out the object when the user is done typing
[17:57:39] <guest_______> it doesnt have to me a loop or anything fancy
[17:57:45] <guest_______> *be
[17:58:27] <guest_______> shoky said something about .map and .each what do they do?
[17:58:44] <doug65536> guest_______: this is about as much sense as I could make of it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6yBM8/11/
[17:59:39] <doug65536> fixed dup ids http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6yBM8/12/
[18:00:14] <guest_______> with a little reworking it should work thanks
[18:01:12] <guest_______> nvm it won't :( i need objects not arrays
[18:01:54] <doug65536> guest_______: sorry, not a mind reader. I can't show how to use an array with imaginary data
[18:02:07] <guest_______> it must hold. ex. name and phone for user[1].name and user[1].phone
[18:02:23] <doug65536> guest_______:  ok, that I can work with...
[18:02:39] <guest_______> yes i understand that and i thank you for your help as i am new to this
[18:08:01] <guideX> I figured it out, the z-index for the qtip was set by js
[18:08:56] <guest_______> doug any thing working yet?
[18:09:00] <doug65536> guest_______: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6yBM8/18/
[18:10:19] <guest_______> ok thanks
[18:10:19] <doug65536> guest_______: also... I would change the event handling slightly... 1 sec
[18:10:45] <doug65536> guest_______: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6yBM8/19/
[18:11:05] <guest_______> ok thanks
[18:20:37] <RRR2> is array.push slower than arr[i]= ?
[18:21:24] <doug65536> RRR2: array.push is pretty fast. make a test on http://jsperf.com
[18:21:56] <RRR2> I'm pretty sure there should be an index containing that already..
[18:22:02] <doug65536> RRR2: if your intent is to append, then I would say .push is much more readable
[18:22:03] <RRR2> where can you search on jsperf
[18:22:22] <doug65536> http://jsperf.com/js-push-vs-index11/2
[18:22:48] <doug65536> RRR2: push is faster on chrome
[18:23:01] <RRR2> push is faster on firefox, neato
[18:23:03] <doug65536> RRR2: firefox is fast as hell, both the same
[18:23:12] <RRR2> I guess I'll use push
[18:23:34] <doug65536> RRR2: it's funny though. for lots of things ff blows away chrome, but not others
[18:24:01] <RRR2> Yeah
[18:24:06] <doug65536> RRR2: to search just put jsperf <search terms> in google
[18:24:19] <RRR2> I would contriboot firefox if I knew how to compile it
[18:24:33] <doug65536> RRR2: are you on linux? it's dead easy on linux
[18:24:43] <RRR2> that's the reason
[18:24:45] <RRR2> I'm not
[18:24:47] <RRR2> HUE
[18:25:34] <RRR2> Also shouldn't I download a nightly repository instead of a stable one?
[18:25:51] <RRR2> It might take a very long time getting the pull request checked.
[18:26:46] <doug65536> RRR2: I hope you have a fast machine. I have a super fast cpu and it takes quite a while to clean build
[18:27:40] <RRR2> Well
[18:27:51] <RRR2> I could turn on my other computer..
[18:27:56] <RRR2> I'm just a laptop guy
[18:28:29] <RRR2> doug65536: well, I still don't know how to compile on... Windows
[18:28:54] <doug65536> RRR2: can't be that hard
[18:29:04] <doug65536> RRR2: it's a pretty clean project
[18:29:53] <doug65536> RRR2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Simple_Firefox_build
[18:33:15] <doug65536> RRR2: there is #firefox channel too if you need help. I'm sure they can answer build questions
[18:33:29] <RRR2> hmm
[18:34:45] <RRR2> doug65536: Step 1, install visual studio 2010
[18:35:18] <doug65536> RRR2: express probably works
[18:35:56] <doug65536> RRR2: starting at 2010, express isn't missing much
[18:36:11] <RRR2> I actually don't know how to do it, at max I use GCC for windows, lel, although file size ends up bigger than when compiling it on visual
[18:36:45] <doug65536> RRR2: ok. who cares about file size. you want to make a patch and submit it right?
[18:37:05] <RRR2> doug65536: (it probably won't compile in gcc)
[18:37:11] <doug65536> if you can handle gcc, msvc is a piece of cake
[18:38:30] <doug65536> RRR2: they support VS right? meaning - they probably generate a solution file and you just go into vs and hit build. otherwise, they use command line compiler and it runs cl.exe. what's the difference?
[18:39:33] <RRR2> Visual Script?
[18:39:38] <RRR2> what is vs
[18:39:44] <RRR2> visual studio
[18:39:45] <RRR2> oh..
[18:39:50] <RRR2> I just herp derped
[18:47:10] <{{Guy}}> Hey guys.... can someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/NNMyt/ and tell me why it's telling me my functions are undefined?
[18:51:07] <insel> which js-pattern-writing-style is compatible to jquery? and how to encapsulate events like jqm.on()?
[19:03:31] <doug65536> Guy ping timeout
[19:03:57] <doug65536> if IRC join/part spam is any indication, the internet is falling apart
[19:04:31] <doug65536> thanks crappy wireless technology!
[19:04:33] <Zak> i have all parts/joins on ignore
[19:04:33] <greg5green> all the internet depends on damascus
[19:05:01] <RRR2> I had all parts/joins ignored
[19:05:09] <RRR2> but I wanted to check out who joined
[19:56:02] <Glasswalker> Hey, I'm trying to do this: http://pastebin.com/2Ls3hCvK but the alert on line 2, and line 8 fire, but the ones on 4 and 5 never fire. (nor the chart render)
[19:56:25] <Glasswalker> Any thoughts as to why? (I'm fairly new to jquery)
[19:57:07] <Glasswalker> if I go to that relative url, I see the json output.
[19:57:30] <Glasswalker> and chrome's javascript console shows no errors...
[19:57:35] <Glasswalker> not really sure how to debug this
[19:59:18] <doug65536> Glasswalker: add $.ajaxSetup({error: function(xhr,status) { alert(status); }});
[19:59:57] <Glasswalker> ok cool I'll try that now
[20:02:23] <Whirl3d> How do I use the ternary operator in php to correctly write: $link_lbl=$topic->get_meta('label")?$topic->get_meta("label"):$topic->the_title;
[20:02:41] <Whirl3d> I don't wan to call get_meta twice...
[20:03:34] <doug65536> php> <?php echo 32 || "false"; ?>
[20:03:41] <b-ot> doug65536: 1
[20:03:43] <Whirl3d> wrong channel, sorry about that...
[20:04:30] <Glasswalker> Parse error. http://pastebin.com/iHaSae59 that is the json the url outputs
[20:05:26] <Glasswalker> doug65536, thanks for the tip by the way, that helped nail down the problem quick! Now just need to figure out what the parse error is
[20:08:02] <tieTYT> I have an image by going $("image").  Is there any way I can set this as the background image of another element?
[20:08:33] <tieTYT> i meant $("#image")
[20:09:15] <doug65536> use .attr to read 'src' and use css("background", "url(" + that_src + ")")
[20:09:18] <greg5green> Glasswalker, idk what your issue is exactly, but comments aren't technically allowed in json
[20:09:29] <tieTYT> doug65536: thanks, I'll try that
[20:09:39] <greg5green> (that doesnt mean that is your issue, ik some js engines dont care)
[20:10:01] <doug65536> comments are illegal
[20:10:20] <greg5green> of course, what you pasted isnt actually json, so i guess i shouldnt have even brought that up
[20:10:28] <doug65536> json is not javascript, it just happens to look like javascript
[20:12:57] <greg5green> the issue is in the last node there
[20:13:05] <Glasswalker> yeah there is html entities in there
[20:13:07] <Glasswalker> I fixed that
[20:13:10] <Glasswalker> still throwing parse error
[20:13:13] <Glasswalker> might be the comments
[20:14:13] <greg5green> I assume you are trying to JSON.stringify?
[20:14:21] <greg5green> in chrome, it will work with the comments in there
[20:14:35] <greg5green> it gets rid of them when it stringifies, but it doesnt throw an error
[20:15:29] <Glasswalker> no, this is code from the high charts example
[20:15:31] <T13> doug65536: what is the touchscreen equivalent to onKeyUp()?
[20:15:32] <Glasswalker> which is in javascript
[20:15:33] <doug65536> it doesn't matter what chrome does. comments are illegal
[20:15:42] <Glasswalker> they point out you can just output it as json
[20:15:52] <Glasswalker> so I had my php app spit out the whole thing
[20:16:01] <Glasswalker> turns out there is a bunch of javascript, comments and so on in there
[20:16:04] <greg5green> yes, they are illegal doug65536, but it isn't the issue with his parse error
[20:16:14] <Glasswalker> I need to figure out how to spit that out as actual json from my php template
[20:16:17] <Glasswalker> ugh
[20:16:17] <doug65536> can you show the json? my telepathic powers are not strong tonight
[20:16:37] <Glasswalker> I don't understand
[20:16:45] <Glasswalker> that's a raw copy and paste of the plain text output of the php script
[20:16:57] <Glasswalker> basically I took the example code on the high charts page
[20:17:00] <Glasswalker> and copied and pasted
[20:17:05] <Glasswalker> and replaced the pertinent parts
[20:17:09] <Glasswalker> and am outputting that from PHP
[20:17:20] <greg5green> why do you have {&quot;type&quot;:&quot;area&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;GHash\/s&quot;,&quot;pointInterval&quot;:311040000,&quot;pointStart&quot;:&quot;Date.UTC(2006, 0, 01)&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:... ?
[20:17:34] <greg5green> it looks to just be an encoded version of everything else
[20:17:35] <doug65536> use json_encode(array) in php
[20:17:42] <Glasswalker> it's not an array
[20:17:43] <Glasswalker> it's plain text
[20:17:53] <doug65536> preferably exit(json_encode(array))
[20:17:57] <doug65536> it has to be an array
[20:18:06] <doug65536> json is either an object or an array at the top level
[20:18:09] <greg5green> yeah, thats not a valid name or string or whatever
[20:18:12] <Glasswalker> I took the example, it's a twig template, which php is just editing
[20:18:20] <Glasswalker> it's not generating json
[20:18:32] <Glasswalker> I'm using a template plain text file as the json and just subbing out plain text values
[20:18:49] <doug65536> totally wrong
[20:18:49] <T13> Objects rock.
[20:18:52] <doug65536> use json_encode
[20:19:06] <Glasswalker> I don't even know where to start in getting that entire structure in php in a way that would generate what it wants
[20:19:12] <Glasswalker> I don't understand json structure well enough
[20:19:21] <Glasswalker> so I wanted to use an example that worked and just "adjust" it
[20:20:05] <Glasswalker> I unterstand object oriented programming in PHP extremely well, but I know jack about javascript and json
[20:20:23] <Glasswalker> so I don't know when it wants a certain format what types of data in php result in that output
[20:20:30] <Glasswalker> is it an array? is it a field? is it an object?
[20:20:32] <Glasswalker> and so on
[20:20:43] <greg5green> forgive me, not terribly familiar with php
[20:21:04] <greg5green> but what you put into json_encode should be an array or idk what they call it in php
[20:21:07] <greg5green> hash?
[20:21:12] <doug65536> you have two options with json. an array, or an object. take your pick and use json_encode
[20:21:13] <greg5green> that doesnt sound right
[20:21:27] <greg5green> multi-dimensional array?
[20:21:32] <Glasswalker> right, my point is the framework I'm using expects a specific layout
[20:21:35] <doug65536> IT CAN be nested
[20:21:37] <Glasswalker> (that specific layout to be exact)
[20:21:41] <greg5green> either one of those can go into json_encode
[20:21:48] <Glasswalker> I get that, I just don't know which should be arrays, which should be objects, and so on
[20:22:00] <doug65536> an array is not an object
[20:22:02] <greg5green> for starters, your framework DEFINITELY does not expect what you just put on the internet
[20:22:06] <greg5green> because the last bit
[20:22:14] <greg5green> {&quot;type&quot;:&quot;area&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;GHa... is 100% invalid
[20:22:52] <Glasswalker> Right I got that, and fixed it
[20:22:54] <Glasswalker> not the problem
[20:22:55] <Glasswalker> ok...
[20:22:58] <Glasswalker> lets step back a bit
[20:23:01] <Glasswalker> http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series
[20:23:04] <Glasswalker> I'm using that example
[20:23:11] <Glasswalker> hit the "view config" button to see the config code
[20:23:18] <Glasswalker> I literally copied and pasted that
[20:23:31] <doug65536> I've already stepped all the way back and what I see is completely utterly invalid json
[20:23:41] <Glasswalker> If I need to do that with json_encode
[20:23:50] <Glasswalker> then I need to know what php structures will result in that exact layout
[20:23:56] <Glasswalker> because that's what the framework requires
[20:24:15] <doug65536> in json, an "object" is a bunch of key/value pairs. an array is an ordered sequence of things
[20:24:59] <doug65536> the value can be an array, an object, a number, a string, a boolean true/false, or null
[20:25:14] <doug65536> an array is a bunch of values
[20:25:33] <Glasswalker> ok...
[20:25:35] <Glasswalker> one sec
[20:26:20] <Glasswalker> http://pastebin.com/ipzcm6et
[20:26:35] <Glasswalker> That is the example javascript for creating the chart with the framework I'm using
[20:26:52] <greg5green> glasswalker
[20:27:00] <Glasswalker> what I want to do is replace all the contents of the $('container').highcharts() call
[20:27:12] <Glasswalker> to do $('container').highcharts(config)
[20:27:16] <greg5green> and you're just outputting it inline?
[20:27:21] <Glasswalker> with config containing all that json stuff they had
[20:27:25] <greg5green> not making some ajax call to get it?
[20:27:29] <Glasswalker> (config being a variable)
[20:27:33] <Glasswalker> I want to call it all in ajax
[20:27:42] <Glasswalker> the example code has it inline
[20:27:45] <Glasswalker> I want to do it with ajax
[20:27:50] <Glasswalker> that's what I'm trying to do
[20:27:58] <Glasswalker> so I copied that into a plain text file
[20:28:05] <Glasswalker> and used getJSON to try and load those contents
[20:28:16] <greg5green> ok
[20:28:17] <Glasswalker> but that fails because it has a bunch of comments and inline javascript
[20:28:26] <Glasswalker> so the straight-up method won't work
[20:28:32] <Glasswalker> you are saying use json-encode
[20:28:34] <Glasswalker> that's fine I can do that
[20:28:43] <Glasswalker> but I don't understand for example chart:
[20:28:45] <Glasswalker> is that an object?
[20:28:49] <Glasswalker> or a nested array?
[20:29:02] <greg5green> in js, thats an object
[20:29:10] <Glasswalker> or a more complex one plotOptions
[20:29:15] <Glasswalker> has many nested structures
[20:29:23] <greg5green> objects in objects
[20:29:31] <Glasswalker> so the reason I used the plain text approach is that I didn't understand the php structures required
[20:29:34] <greg5green> and some arrays inside objects too
[20:29:43] <Glasswalker> ok
[20:29:47] <Glasswalker> how do I distinguish them?
[20:30:02] <greg5green> you need to figure out exactly what you actually need to pass
[20:30:06] <greg5green> because you cant send all of that via php
[20:30:23] <greg5green> well, i guess you could
[20:30:34] <greg5green> but it would be messy
[20:30:38] <Glasswalker> ok well I kind of need to pass all of that via php :)
[20:30:46] <doug65536> object: array("name" => "doug", "age" => "37")
[20:30:54] <doug65536> array: array(1,2,3,4,5)
[20:31:05] <greg5green> text: document.ontouchstart === undefined ?
[20:31:05] <greg5green>                     'Click and drag in the plot area to zoom in' :
[20:31:05] <greg5green>                     'Pinch the chart to zoom in'
[20:31:13] <T13|sleeps> Your 37 doug65536 ?
[20:31:16] <T13|sleeps> :p
[20:31:21] <greg5green> thats going to be tough to pass via php
[20:31:43] <Glasswalker> right in that specific case I can get around that one with a simple string
[20:31:49] <Glasswalker> I don't care about detecting the touchscreen
[20:32:06] <Glasswalker> and the javascript that pulls the colour from the array
[20:32:09] <Glasswalker> I can get around that too
[20:32:15] <Glasswalker> (store the colour arrays in the php)
[20:32:28] <Glasswalker> ok I think I've got my head around this
[20:32:30] <greg5green> you'll need to make something like the object doug just put up there
[20:32:30] <Glasswalker> thanks for your help
[20:34:07] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: how old did you think I was?
[20:34:35] <T13|sleeps> 65,536?
[20:34:41] <doug65536> lol
[20:34:42] <doug65536> not yet
[20:34:43] <T13|sleeps> xD
[21:05:58] <shoerain> Is there a synchronous version of $.getJSON()?
[21:06:42] <doug65536> if there was only an idiot would call it. just sayin
[21:07:30] <doug65536> you never have to use synchronous. if you think you do, you're doing it wrong
[21:08:02] <doug65536> if you want to make your page suck, you can use $.ajaxSetup({async:false})
[21:10:38] <shoerain> asked because what I wanted wasn't working inside the callback for some reason. But it's working fine now, hm..
[21:17:27] <doug65536> everything works in a callback, it's never that
[21:17:34] <doug65536> due to how closures work
[22:25:52] <LoneSoldier728> hey how do u clear a session id on logout with jquery
[22:26:01] <LoneSoldier728> I have the logout button clearing the cookie currently
[23:53:47] <ravenzz> good morning
[23:56:58] <juboba> Hey, I built a chat system for my application and I'm stuck trying to animate the user name div when a message arrives. I'm trying $('the_div').effect('bounce', {distance: 10, times: 3}, 500); but I have the problem that if many messages arrive quickly the effect occurs one after another. I would like that if a message arrives while bouncing that new bounce never occurs.
[23:57:26] <juboba> any ideas?
[23:58:41] <ravenzz> code?
[23:59:08] <ravenzz> just a snippet/testcase that reproduce the behaviour
[23:59:15] <juboba> uhm
[23:59:24] <juboba> let me try
