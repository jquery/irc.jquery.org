[00:01:20] <nafg_> Hi, anyone here using select2?
[00:01:26] <nafg_> It's "blowing up"
[00:02:04] <nafg_> select2 3.3
[00:02:07] <nesoi> hm. so I create some buttons (jqm), and I give them IDs, but it's not one element that jqm creates, it's a bunch, and only one of them has the ID  I gave the button. So how do I remove the button? If I remove the element with that ID, it won't remove the whole button, only that element of the button which jqm created which has the id
[00:02:24] <nafg_> As soon as I start typing I get a huge white rectangle
[00:02:50] <nafg_> <div id="select2-drop-mask" class="select2-drop-mask" style="width: 1265px; height: 53459px;"></div>
[00:04:27] <nafg_> What is drop mask? And why is it so big?
[00:07:15] <Petazz> I have a link(<a>) in a div which is connected to toggle. How can I prevent the toggle of fireing when pressing the hyperlink?
[00:07:17] <nafg_> Is there some other channel that's more appropriate for select2 questions?
[00:07:34] <nafg_> Or, is there another infinite-scroll autocomplete someone can recommend?
[00:09:13] <Cork> Petazz: you mean the toggle is on click on the div?
[00:10:20] <Petazz> Cork: Yes
[00:10:24] <Cork> Petazz: $('div a').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[00:10:40] <Cork> recommend replacing the selector :)
[00:10:47] <Petazz> I tried that but it didn't seem to work. Let me try that again :)
[00:10:53] <nafg_> Anyone here know select2?
[00:12:54] <Cork> nafg_: from https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/blob/master/select2.js#L1085 it looks like its an element used to cover the select box with
[00:13:12] <Cork> and https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/blob/master/select2.js#L1125
[00:13:58] <nafg_> Thanks Cork.
[00:14:01] <nafg_> So why is it exploding?
[00:14:06] <nafg_> All I have is this:
[00:14:20] <Cork> nafg_: read the code, i have no clue
[00:14:33] <Cork> never heard of it before
[00:15:02] <nafg_> function format(item) { return item.tag; };
[00:15:02] <nafg_> $('#eqpItems').select2({data: { results: [{id:0,tag:'enhancement'},{id:1,tag:'bug'}], text: 'tag' },
[00:15:02] <nafg_> formatSelection: format,formatResult: format})
[00:19:17] <nafg_> OH NO WONDER
[00:27:38] <nafg_> Now I have another select2 issue
[00:27:49] <nafg_> Anyone know select2?
[00:44:35] <talntid> http://pastebin.com/KxnqeMWN
[00:44:52] <talntid> if I want to change the "events" part of that dynamically, how would I redefine it?
[00:45:48] <djQuery> event: funciton(){ do dynamic stuff here? }
[00:51:57] <Parsi> I have a button with webAddNew id, and this script  $('#webAddNew').click(function () {   window.location.href = 'category.aspx?section=blah&lang=en';        });
[00:52:08] <Parsi> but when i click the button nothing happens
[00:53:09] <djQuery> Parsi, why not just a <a href =   and style it like a button?
[00:53:31] <Cork> Parsi: are you running the selector before or after you added the button to the page?
[00:53:33] <Parsi> djQuery: it should be a button, they are two other buttons
[00:53:34] <djQuery> Parsi, open the console and see if yo uhave errors
[00:53:47] <Parsi> Cronoh: before
[00:53:58] <Cork> then you need to use a delegated listener
[00:53:58] <Parsi> djQuery: there is no error/warning
[00:53:59] <djQuery> Parsi, see ?on
[00:54:00] <bot-t> Parsi, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:54:14] <Cork> $(document).on('click' '#webAddNew', function() {})
[00:54:29] <Parsi> djQuery: this script works on other pages!
[00:55:15] <Parsi> Cork: worked!
[00:55:25] <nafg_> Can someone please help me with select2?
[00:58:27] <nafg_> Whew, thank G-d it's working now
[01:02:42] <talntid> http://pastebin.com/KxnqeMWN
[01:02:53] <talntid> I need to change the "Events" part of that, on click of another item. advice?
[01:06:50] <talntid> nevermind. found a better method

[01:23:51] <ermajn_> hi there, I have problem.. that i bind context event, but on IE there is also default context menu visible when I right click. So on IE i have two menus. I have tried e.preventDefault(), with no help
[01:23:59] <ermajn_> any suggestions?
[01:30:06] <Cork> ermajn_: its most likely a setting in the browser (same as for the other)
[01:30:21] <Cork> ermajn_: if the user don't allow the webpage to replace the menu, you can't do it
[01:30:53] <ermajn_> Cork: it's default browser setting, tested on 3 different computers
[01:31:08] <Krisostoomus> How is right to use or in phpquery: $qq4=$pq2->find("[class=Item ItemComment]:or([class=Item Alt ItemComment])"); or how?
[01:32:18] <Cork> Krinkle|detached: 1. don't select classes based on the attribute, and 2. its comma
[01:33:19] <Cork> find(".Item.ItemComment, .Item.Alt.ItemComment"); is what you want
[01:33:49] <Cork> though find(".Item.ItemComment") looks like it should work just fine
[01:34:22] <Krisostoomus> thanks
[01:34:51] <rakl> hey jquery experts, why is this http://imgur.com/b8zZP1I
[01:35:04] <rakl> why is .data() doing funky things with my string
[01:36:10] <Cork> rakl: data is for reading intended values
[01:36:24] <Cork> ex it can read json, numbers and so on
[01:36:41] <Cork> if you want the raw data use attr('data-user-id')
[01:37:16] <rakl> Cork ok that works thanks
[01:37:40] <Cork> rakl: also if you modify the attribute after reading it with .data() jquery won't catch it
[01:37:54] <Cork> when you query .data() jquery will cache internally whats in the attribute
[01:38:01] <Cork> and not ask it again
[01:38:34] <rakl> learn something every day
[01:38:36] <rakl> even at 2 am
[01:38:39] <rakl> thanks Cork
[01:38:52] <rakl> not needing to modify luckily
[01:54:50] <lejocelyn> hey, can someone help me with a beginner's issue ? http://jsfiddle.net/FN88m/12/
[01:55:21] <lejocelyn> I would like to add an input after the button I click on
[01:57:20] <Cork> lejocelyn: $(this).after('<input type="text"><br>')
[01:57:45] <lejocelyn> ahh, thank you
[02:00:50] <Cork> lejocelyn: alternatively var input = $('<input type="text"><br>'); $(this).after(input); input.focus()
[02:01:32] <lejocelyn> Cork: definitly more readable :)
[02:13:16] <jammanbo> I'd like to be able to listen for any events that change my DOM. I was thinking of extending the following functions to raise a custom event that I could bind to: 'after', 'append', 'attr', 'before', 'html', 'prepend', 'prop', 'val', 'wrapAll'.
[02:13:20] <jammanbo> a) Is that every relevant function, b) Is this a terrible idea?
[02:14:32] <Cork> jammanbo: its a terrible idea, cause its costly to propagate all the data
[02:14:46] <Cork> and its way to easy to miss things if you do it manually
[02:14:50] <jammanbo> Cork: This was my feeling :/
[02:15:07] <Cork> (if you append a string with multiple elements and children, what should it propagate? )
[02:15:17] <Cork> jammanbo: there is a reason why its not supported natively
[02:15:39] <hagb4rd> and for the 2nd: you wouldn't win anything by creating event listeners you don't need.. anything but a buch of useless eventlisteners of course
[02:15:41] <Cork> jammanbo: there is something on the way though, though cause of ie its going to be a few years away
[02:15:50] <jammanbo> Cork: Is it not what DOM4 Mutation Observers are for?
[02:15:54] <hagb4rd> just bind on demand
[02:15:55] <Cork> ?ndc mutations observers
[02:15:57] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "ndc mutations observers" in jQuery Docs.
[02:16:00] <Cork> jammanbo: exactly
[02:16:09] <hagb4rd> -> observable pattern
[02:16:17] <hagb4rd> i prefer knockout.js
[02:16:30] <Cork> jammanbo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/MutationObserver
[02:16:37] <hagb4rd> in which i can .subscribe() to any obervable
[02:16:46] <hagb4rd> so it reacts on change
[02:16:49] <Cork> jammanbo: it differs from events in that it doesn't propagate
[02:16:55] <jammanbo> I see
[02:17:16] <Cork> so you don't get all those harry problems from dom modification events (and earlier draft)
[02:18:44] <hagb4rd> jammando: check this out.. it's worth 10 minutes of investigation.. watch for .subscribe()
[02:18:52] <hagb4rd> http://knockoutjs.com/
[02:19:26] <jammanbo> hagb4rd: Am on Backbone
[02:19:42] <hagb4rd> node.js?
[02:35:14] <otiuk> can you not grab the value of a tel or email input type like:  $('input:tel[name=phone]').val()?
[02:36:21] <Cork> yes
[02:36:27] <Cork> well not :tel
[02:36:48] <Cork> but $('input[type="tel"][name="phone"]')
[02:38:43] <otiuk> cork, so you can't using the colon method i guess like you can for text
[02:39:04] <Cork> otiuk: well you can if you write a function for it
[02:39:20] <Cork> otiuk: but those functions is slow so if you can its better to not use them
[02:39:34] <otiuk> ya i'm grabbing an error from the jquery file
[02:40:06] <otiuk> what's the better way to get a value of a field without them having an id but by their name?
[02:40:49] <Cork> [name="value"]
[02:42:13] <otiuk> $('[name="phone"]').val()?
[02:42:25] <Cork> yes
[02:42:32] <Cork> well input before that
[02:43:02] <Cork> $('input[name="phone"]').val()?
[02:43:46] <otiuk> what other options are available as far as where input is?
[02:43:46] <talntid> this is insanity
[02:43:58] <Cork> otiuk: what do you mean?
[02:44:06] <talntid> i started with jquery tonight, and i have already about 40% rewritten an app that took me a few months to build initially.
[02:44:11] <Cork> its nothing special with inputs when it comes to selectors
[02:44:42] <Cork> talntid: ya, its fun to see how much code melts aways when you go from native to jquery :)
[02:44:43] <otiuk> does input in that example you put refer to <input> tag?  if so.. can you switch it to textarea.. so like $('text area[name="name"]').val()?
[02:45:02] <Cork> otiuk: yes
[02:45:17] <talntid> Cork, aside from that, I didn't have much JS in the original app... now that I am mostly JS... it's insanely cleaner.
[02:45:33] <Cork> otiuk: or $('input[name="name"], textarea[name="name"]')
[02:45:59] <talntid> now I do need to go rewrite a bunch of the back-end stuff, but, it's not going to take a ton. I could complete it tonight if I really want to
[02:46:54] <otiuk> wow that's excellent
[02:47:22] <Cork> otiuk: jquery uses standard css selectors
[02:47:30] <Cork> otiuk: so it works mostly the same way
[02:47:35] <Cork> with a few extensions
[02:48:59] <otiuk> right.. i was just curious if i'm validating a form if it was necessary to give every a field an id instead of a name or both or if i give them a name if i could just call their value that way
[02:50:16] <Cork> otiuk: you could validate a form based on the form + classes on the elements
[02:50:36] <Cork> class="required" for fields that can't be empty class="email required" and so on
[02:50:42] <otiuk> sorry i also meant processing the form
[02:50:48] <Cork> its quite easy to make a nice validator based on that
[02:50:59] <ravenzz> Cork why?
[02:51:01] <otiuk> i understand the whole putting a class to make it required or whatever
[02:51:13] <Cork> ravenzz: one validator and then you control it based on the html
[02:51:20] <ravenzz> Cork why don't use the required attr/type
[02:51:22] <otiuk> but i'm also having jquery process the form
[02:51:29] <ravenzz> no extra stuff
[02:51:36] <Cork> ravenzz: heh, well mostly cause i wrote it before html5 :)
[02:51:37] <ravenzz> (classes in this case)
[02:51:44] <ravenzz> oh k
[02:51:46] <otiuk> haha
[02:51:53] <Cork> but ya, today i prob would have used the attributes instead
[02:51:54] <otiuk> i was going to say it probably predates html5
[02:52:29] <Cork> first time i wrote it is close to 6 years old now >_>
[02:52:42] <Cork> and is still in use ^^
[02:52:59] <otiuk> if it's not broke don't fix it?
[02:53:08] <Cork> kinda :)
[02:53:11] <ravenzz> otiuk every field need a name attribute though
[02:53:30] <Cork> and its so basic jquery functionality that its hard to break it actually
[02:53:41] <ravenzz> and an ID if it is not wrapped by a label
[02:53:44] <otiuk> right.. that's why for processing i was wondering if i could just grab values per their name and/or loop thru all form elements or what have you
[02:54:11] <otiuk> i am not well-versed in the capabilities of jQuery; however, i am doing my best to absorb as much as I can as I start using it a bit
[02:54:24] <Cork> otiuk: $(form).find('input, textarea, select')
[02:54:29] <ravenzz> otiuk usually I would loop, and avalidate all the required and not blank fields
[02:54:41] <ravenzz> validate*
[02:55:15] <otiuk> i'm just throwing together a simple mailing list add script so i only have 3 fields so i just wanted to grab fields quick.. without trying to learn if i could loop thru them all lol
[02:55:58] <ravenzz> otiuk tbh the loop thing is the easiest one :p
[02:56:34] <otiuk> not when you have to research to do it.. i knew how to pull values.. or thought i did :)
[02:56:53] <otiuk> the way i was using it didn't support tel, email, etc fields
[02:57:03] <anew> anyone using require and backbone ?
[02:57:08] <ravenzz> also considering that you have a small and easy form, it is a good way/occasion to learn how to do that properly
[02:57:48] <otiuk> ravenzz, i agree if i didn't have other crap to do before i have to start the non-developer part of my day hah
[02:58:07] <otiuk> but i will definitely get there eventually as things progress
[02:59:17] <otiuk> i really appreciate all the help and input Cork & ravenzz
[03:02:06] <ravenzz> yw
[03:02:29] <yura_> Hello

[03:08:48] <anew> doesnt make sense i cant visualize it
[03:09:19] <mathijspb> if no one can help you here maybe try it at #requirejs
[03:09:37] <esk_> hey everybody, did someone use a good javascript music player with playist support?
[03:14:37] <mathijspb> esk_: maybe you could use peepcode-tunes: https://github.com/angular/peepcode-tunes
[03:17:21] <anew> oh didnt even know there was a requirejs channel
[03:17:26] <anew> thanks mathijspb
[03:17:28] <bahamas> is it normal for jquery to return an error when calling .css() on an element that doesn't have a "style" attribute?
[03:17:34] <jammanbo> anew come over to documentcloud
[03:17:45] <anew> jammanbo already asked there :(
[03:17:51] <anew> no one ever answers questions in there
[03:19:05] <MOSLIM> Hello every one , please i look for a way to read the url content in jquery ?
[03:19:10] <MOSLIM> i need examples
[03:20:01] <bahamas> MOSLIM: url content?
[03:20:27] <raygerrard> window.location.href
[03:20:34] <MOSLIM> for ex : http://domain.tld  prin in web browser 'Hello world'  i want to read this content with jqeury and print it in a <div>
[03:22:29] <bahamas> MOSLIM: you can't because of the same-domain policy. retrieve the content in the backend
[03:23:31] <MOSLIM> not from the same domain : the script may be hosted anywhere !
[03:23:56] <MOSLIM> but it must read the content of another url using jquery
[03:26:37] <bahamas> MOSLIM: yes, that's what I'm saying. you can't do it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[03:27:57] <esk_> mathijspb: i dont feel like adding angularjs jsut for the sake of a music player, any other suggestions
[03:28:38] <Ricaz> I have a game writting purely in js/jQuery (with no libs or anything). I want this to work as a jQuery plugin (i.e. you call $('canvas').myGame();) and it just works. Any good articles on this?
[03:29:15] <Ricaz> written* lol
[03:53:24] <Fernando1asso> I'm trying to get the length of all checked check boxes. var num_checked_elems = $('#table_list input[name=user_arr]:checked').length; It always returns zero.
[03:55:49] <sCoRpi> Fernando1asso: provide an example on jsbin please
[03:55:53] <Fernando1asso> H'm. The html looks like <input type='checkbox' name='user_arr[]'. I just replaced name=user_arr to name=user_arr[] in that jQuery query, and it works. I find that strange. Why would [] be needed?
[03:58:12] <sahbeewah> because it's part of the name
[03:59:01] <Fernando1asso> Okay, but I always thought that was just to denote that it is an array, and that wouldn't be necessary in javascript. But it makes sense anyway.
[04:01:07] <bahamas> Fernando1asso: it wouldn't be necessary. you're doing something else that's different
[04:01:21] <Fernando1asso> Also, I see that some people use attribute='value' whereas others use attribute=value. Is there any practical difference. Is one more correct than the other?
[04:01:59] <bahamas> Fernando1asso: the former allows spaces in 'value'
[04:02:09] <Fernando1asso> Alright. Thanks.
[04:04:30] <Fernando1asso> bahamas: This is the html: <td class='checkbox_button'><input type='checkbox' name='user_arr[]' value='<?php echo $id; ?>'></td> and I had to do this to get the length of checked input fields: var num_checked_elems = $("#table_list input[name='user_arr[]']:checked").length;
[04:05:23] <Ricaz> is this possible?: var someImg = new Image().src = "bla.jpg";
[04:05:25] <Rufus> Greetings. Does any one know of a jquery virtual tour/panorama viewer with zoom-in and Y axsis movement too ?
[04:05:51] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at this --> http://jsfiddle.net/xy2GQ/1/ <-- why does the jquery not wait for the fade before it alerts?
[04:05:53] <bahamas> Fernando1asso: and if you replace user_arr[] with user_arr in both places, it doesn't work?
[04:05:57] <Petazz> Cork: Could it be that the toggle is triggered first and the a click afterwards?
[04:05:57] <bahamas> Ricaz: did you try it?
[04:06:21] <Kingsy> surely the execution is sequential ?
[04:06:26] <Fernando1asso> bahamas: Yep, but I need user_arr[] so that I can get an array in php.
[04:06:46] <Fernando1asso> The user may want to delete multiple records at once.
[04:07:08] <Cork> Petazz: toggle?, you mean the old toggle(func, func, func) call?
[04:07:23] <chilversc_> Kingsy: because fade is asynchronous
[04:07:29] <bahamas> Kingsy: it's not
[04:07:37] <Cork> Petazz: that code is depricated, and you should prob avoid it to make upgrading to 1.9 easier
[04:07:50] <Cork> (its removed in 1.9(
[04:08:03] <sahbeewah> Fernando1asso, as far as html/javascript are concerned, user_arr and user_arr[] are two completely different names
[04:08:22] <sahbeewah> the conversion of the duplicate names into arrays because there are square brackets is a server-side dependent behaviour
[04:08:27] <sahbeewah> in this case, php allows for that
[04:08:54] <FernandoBasso> All right.
[04:09:10] <Kingsy> what other functions are asyncronous ? I have something like the following --> http://pastie.org/6125136 <-- its basically just a snippet from a js library I am using, but I NEED it to run sequentially, otherwise I get some strage effects on slow browsers..
[04:09:20] <FernandoBasso> Okay.
[04:09:30] <Cork> Kingsy: timer calls, event calls, network calls
[04:09:35] <Petazz> Cork: Ah ok so what would be the newer way :D
[04:09:41] <bahamas> I don't know exactly how php works but it shouldn't depend on attribute values like that
[04:09:57] <Cork> Petazz: bind a click handler and use a variable to trace the state
[04:09:59] <Kingsy> Cork: which specifically would help me here?
[04:10:01] <chilversc_> Kingsy: any method can be asynchronous, the only way to know is to read the documentation for that method
[04:10:06] <Cork> $(this).data('state') for ex.
[04:10:26] <Cork> Kingsy: what was the original question?
[04:11:30] <Cork> Kingsy: and every thing there should run in sequence
[04:11:36] <Kingsy> Cork: that snippet I pasted, basically, it hides and image, changes it, sets a height and width and displays it, but because some of the code is asyncronous it is say displaying the image before it has changed the height and width for example.. (the results seem to vary from browser to browser)
[04:11:54] <Cork> Kingsy: nothing in there is async
[04:12:22] <Kingsy> hrm really??? man o man, I am get some really weird image "stacking" on IE8
[04:12:38] <Kingsy> where the image will shift around for about half a second then settle
[04:12:42] <Cork> well possibly with exception of CloudZoom($("#zoom1"), opts)
[04:12:46] <Cork> not sure what that call does
[04:12:56] <bahamas> Kingsy: fade takes as an argument a function that can be called once the effect is complete
[04:13:23] <Kingsy> bahamas: yeah I am not using a fade here, it was just an example to illustrate my point.
[04:13:26] <Cork> bahamas: there are no fade in that code
[04:13:39] <Kingsy> Cork: yeah I used a fade in a little exmaple eariler
[04:13:51] <Kingsy> Cork: how would I check to see if that CloudZoom call is async ?
[04:14:12] <Cork> Kingsy: btw, seriously, no, just NO => eval('var    a = {' + $("#zoom1").attr('rel') + '}');
[04:14:36] <bahamas> Kingsy: look at its docs. maybe it supports a similar 'complete' argument as well
[04:14:37] <Kingsy> Cork: haha yeah, this is just a library I downloaded
[04:14:51] <Cork> Kingsy: var a = JSON.parse('{' + $("#zoom1").attr('rel') '}');
[04:14:57] <chilversc_> Kingsy: read the CloudZoom documentation
[04:17:48] <Kingsy> hrm let me see
[04:21:02] <Kambfhase> bot-t: Long time, no see
[04:21:05] <bot-t> Kambfhase, jQuery Mobile Docs - Prefetching & caching pages - http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/pages/page-cache.html
[04:21:16] <Kingsy> chilversc_: yeah as it turns out it says <static> CloudZoom.cloudzoom_ready() is fired when images have loaded...  how so you hook into an event?
[04:23:11] <chilversc_> Kingsy: depends on how the event is implemented, you'll have to check the docs
[04:23:36] <bahamas> chilversc_: couldn't he use $(document).on()
[04:23:38] <bahamas> ?
[04:25:06] <chilversc_> bahamas: if the api raises it as a dom event
[04:25:22] <chilversc_> but it could mainatin its own array of event handlers and have a register handler method
[04:25:37] <chilversc_> or it could be implemented as a callback you provide by calling a function, or when setting up the object
[04:25:43] <chilversc_> there are loads of ways it can be implementd
[04:26:42] <Petazz> Cork: I have a list where I toggle open (animate then with more height), what would be the best way to save into the var which of them is open currently. Var curOpen = $(this)?
[04:27:11] <bahamas> chilversc_: I see
[04:27:18] <iksik> hello
[04:27:24] <Cork> Petazz: thats one option, or set a variable on a parent
[04:27:39] <Cork> Petazz: it depends on how generic you want it
[04:27:57] <Petazz> I'm having problems testing if curOpen == $(this)
[04:28:09] <jammanbo> Does anyone know anything about the disappearance of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global? Is it gone, core, renamed, …?
[04:28:21] <seutje> Petazz: u can't compare jQuery collections like that
[04:28:27] <Petazz> Setting a variable on parent? So put a new attribute to a parent element?
[04:28:27] <Cork> Petazz: curOpen = this; if(curOpen === this)
[04:28:32] <seutje> $() !== $()
[04:29:09] <iksik> i'm using .draggable from jquery-ui, i'm trying to implement my custom drag limiter inside of drag:function(){}, and i'm trying to use $(ui.helper).css('left','200px') to force left position of drag helper, but it doesn't seems to work, so i think i'm doing it wrong, how should i handle that?
[04:29:48] <Petazz> seutje: Yep, so what could work insted..?
[04:30:06] <seutje> u can compare DOM elements instead
[04:30:24] <seutje> curOpen[0] == this for instance
[04:30:30] <Petazz> So equally looking DOM-elements have a unique ID under the hood?
[04:31:08] <Cork> Petazz: or just save the "this" directly
[04:31:22] <Petazz> Yea I'll do that
[04:31:22] <seutje> no, each spawned jQuery collection is a separate instance
[04:31:23] <Petazz> thx
[04:31:24] <Cork> Petazz: yes dom elements references can be compared
[04:31:28] <seutje> so they're inherently not equal
[04:31:38] <iksik> anyone? :(
[04:31:51] <seutje> $('*')[0] === $('*')[0]
[04:32:30] <Petazz> Cork: Hmm ok now if one is open but I click another which is of the same kind (but not the same exact element) it still counts curOpen == this -> true
[04:32:42] <seutje> ?eval new Object() == new Object()
[04:32:49] <bot-t> seutje: false
[04:32:56] <Cork> Petazz: no, it has to be the exact same dom element
[04:33:06] <seutje> Petazz: it's comparable to that object example
[04:33:28] <seutje> they aren't the same thing, they're different instances of the same thing
[04:33:29] <bahamas> Petazz: say again what you're trying to do on a higher level
[04:33:57] <Cork> bahamas: a replacement for toggle(func, func, func)
[04:34:15] <Petazz> I have a list of items which have hidden content. When I click them, they open up (I increase height). But I only want one item to be open at a time
[04:34:35] <Cork> Petazz: why not set a class on them when you show them
[04:34:45] <Cork> the first thing you do is hide them all, then show the current?
[04:34:53] <bahamas> right
[04:34:59] <Petazz> Hmm true. I actually have a class to hide it
[04:35:09] <seutje> or just make it instanciable and keep a reference around?
[04:35:27] <bahamas> the class solution sounds more simple
[04:35:30] <Petazz> Make it instanciable?
[04:35:41] <seutje> so u can like this.$elements.not(this.$active).doShit()
[04:36:32] <Petazz> Hmm I don't quite get what that does
[04:36:36] <Cork> seutje: it would be a lot more complicated then just adding a class
[04:36:41] <seutje> true
[04:36:51] <seutje> but it would allow multiple on the same page with only half the DOM fiddling
[04:36:52] <Cork> Petazz: this in that case referes to a "class"
[04:36:55] <Petazz> I'll try that, seems easy
[04:37:13] <Cork> seutje: so can the class actually
[04:37:19] <Cork> all you need is to limit it on a parent
[04:37:28] <seutje> there u go
[04:37:44] <seutje> and then ur doing the traversing over and over again, right?
[04:37:48] <Cork> and it has another up side, its accessable to other code snippets
[04:38:22] <Cork> seutje: well ya, but its only on user actions, and that is NORMALLY not a problem
[04:38:26] <seutje> u could fuck with the prototype... :P
[04:38:43] <Petazz> Noo monkey patching.. :D
[04:38:47] <seutje> I guess it might be a bit over-engineered for a one-time solution
[04:38:58] <Cork> ya :)
[04:39:08] <seutje> no, I'm just saying it would still allow monkey-patching like a regular classname based solution would
[04:39:16] <Petazz> Yea just a simple solution is great :D I don't have to be that general
[04:39:33] <seutje> so just use a class then :)
[04:39:42] <Petazz> Yep I will thx :D
[04:39:56] <Cork> and normally its very nice to have indications in the dom of what happens
[04:40:19] <Cork> unless the code gets heavy, then you need to remove the "niceness" to gain speed
[04:40:19] <seutje> true, but again, that's a limit you could easily not impose
[04:41:03] <Cork> additionally, you do lose in memory usage instead of the limited speed gain
[04:41:42] <seutje> depends on what u keep around, and it'll still be pretty marginal :P
[04:41:50] <seutje> but yeah, just go with the class thing
[04:42:07] <seutje> I'ma go back to beating IE7 into submission
[04:55:48] <xdjuj_> Hi :)
[04:56:00] <xdjuj_> What is actually the best Custom Select jQuery plugin ?
[04:58:47] <talntid> xdjuj_, i like chosen
[05:03:41] <solars> hey, does anyone know what these 2 errors mean? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4ad62bc115c67f542d58 property msie undefined and no method getAttribute... how can I fix this?
[05:05:21] <Kingsy> hrm damn.. it doesnt look like this library has an event that is triggered when its complete... I am using an old version.
[05:07:03] <bahamas> Kingsy: try to find a different, better library
[05:08:02] <bahamas> solars: you've messed up something when including the libraries
[05:08:10] <enzyme> hello
[05:08:13] <enzyme> anyone about?
[05:08:17] <enzyme> thought i'd report a minor bug
[05:08:45] <talntid> http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket?redirectedfrom=
[05:08:45] <talntid> :)
[05:09:20] <enzyme> i can't do it here?
[05:09:38] <enzyme> meh i'll do it there then
[05:09:42] <bahamas> enzyme: not officially. but you can mention it here and maybe realize it's not a bug
[05:09:52] <enzyme> ok
[05:09:56] <talntid> you can, but it's unlikely anyone will do anything about it until it is done through official channels
[05:09:58] <enzyme> it may have already been flagged
[05:10:11] <enzyme> well i came here via the jquery website
[05:10:18] <enzyme> it instructed me that i'd get a quicker response in here
[05:10:18] <enzyme> so
[05:10:43] <talntid> whatcha got?
[05:10:51] <bahamas> enzyme: sure. people might confirm that it's a bug or something wrong with your code
[05:10:59] <enzyme> as i said, its no big deal, but these things work by people helping out right?
[05:11:18] <enzyme> anyway, a jqueryui dropdown box in a jqueryui dialog.  pull down the drop down menu, move the dialog around. the drop down detaches from the textbox
[05:11:41] <talntid> can you provide a jsfiddle example?
[05:13:36] <enzyme> i'd have to create one, i'm not sure i cba to be honest
[05:15:16] <bahamas> enzyme: what part do you find difficult?
[05:19:09] <xdjuj_> talntid thx :)
[05:19:19] <xdjuj_> Seemed to be a little bit old no ?
[05:21:43] <ionas> Hello
[05:21:52] <ionas> I am having an issue with jqXHR.status === 0
[05:22:09] <ionas> Described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4807572/jquery-ajax-error-handling-to-ignore-aborted
[05:22:10] <ionas> "I get the same status and readyState if ajax could not connect to the server to begin with. But this is the error I want to handle. Only aborted not. – Mitar Feb 1 '12 at 13:36"
[05:23:13] <ionas> I am developing using vbox and when I shutdown my server the error gets triggered
[05:23:19] <ionas> e.g. no connection available
[05:23:43] <ionas> issue is: when the client connection (or server) is very slow (I add a sleep(5) to my php) ...
[05:23:50] <ionas> and the client clicks a link, the error is also shown
[05:24:16] <ionas> e.g. it throws "abort" but it does though when both a.) the user really aborts the XHR and b.) the user cannot connect to the server at all
[05:24:33] <ionas> any directions?
[05:30:07] <ionas> ok while the task is a different this one helped me: http://paulrademacher.com/blog/jquery-gotcha-error-callback-triggered-on-xhr-abort/
[05:30:19] <ionas> just check for if ((jqXHR.status === 0) and (exception !== 'abort')) {
[05:31:01] <v0lZy> hello
[05:32:17] <v0lZy> I'm pretty much a newb at jquery, and i'm trying to have a custom horizontal scrollbar that would scroll unordered lists
[05:32:54] <v0lZy> I've tried some plugins but no success getting them to work with what I want to achieve
[05:33:19] <v0lZy> (my idea is to have an infinite horizontally shown <ul>
[05:33:57] <v0lZy> any helpful pointers as to which jquery plugin to go with for this or how to write my own scrollbar (probably too compliated for me though)
[05:36:38] <Antiga> v0lZy: Check Slider Scrollbar in jQueryUI
[05:41:44] <iksik> anyone can help with jquery-ui draggable?
[05:42:28] <benjick> http://jsfiddle.net/s2zWK/1/ How can I expand the box upwards instead?
[05:43:35] <iksik> ehh ;/
[05:49:19] <soxofaan> Hi all, quick question:  I'm using jQuery.ajax with an url and addition data settings and jsonpcallback, is there a way to get the resulting URL that  jquery will/did request?
[05:50:06] <iksik> http://jsfiddle.net/DwFKV/ - this is a fiddle of my problem :/
[05:53:05] <Jon47> I am trying to use jquery's css method to _remove_ an inline style for a particular property, i have found that setting the property to empty string accomplishes what I'm after -  `$element.css(property, '');` - does this sound like a hack or do you think it can be counted on to continue to work?
[05:54:21] <v0lZy> sorry, pc crashed
[05:57:54] <v0lZy> you mentioned jqueryui
[05:57:59] <v0lZy> is that a plugin for jquery?
[05:59:19] <mikecmpbll> I have a div that is hidden on $(document).click(), but inside that div I have a jQuery datepicker. when I click on a date within the calendar popup for the datepicker, it triggers my $(document).click() event and the original div closes
[05:59:24] <mikecmpbll> how can I prevent this happening?
[06:00:31] <seutje> Jon47: that's intended functionality
[06:00:39] <seutje> Jon47: I do believe NULL also works
[06:00:44] <Kambfhase> mikecmpbll: why do you bind .click() to the document?
[06:01:00] <Raydiation> is there a proper way to detect clicks outside of an area?
[06:01:02] <Jon47> seutje: i tried null and it didn't seem to work, but thanks!
[06:01:07] <Jon47> couldn't find anything in the documentation about it
[06:01:09] <mikecmpbll> it was the only way that came to mind that i could ensure the div closed when i clicked outside of it.
[06:01:20] <Raydiation> i want to slide up a div if i click outside of it
[06:01:35] <seutje> "Setting the value of a style property to an empty string — e.g. $('#mydiv').css('color', '') — removes that property from an element if it has already been directly applied, whether in the HTML style attribute, through jQuery's .css() method, or through direct DOM manipulation of the style property."
[06:01:37] <Raydiation> atm im using stopPropagation when i click on the div
[06:01:40] <seutje> - El Docs
[06:01:52] <mikecmpbll> i think me and Raydiation are on the same page here.
[06:01:52] <Raydiation> the problem is that this also affects other divs that are outside of it
[06:02:00] <mikecmpbll> heh.
[06:02:04] <Kambfhase> mikecmpbll: there is a ben alman plugin for that http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[06:02:07] <Raydiation> hehe coincidence
[06:02:23] <seutje> Kambfhase: that phrase is copyrights :P
[06:03:11] <Kambfhase> Ben Alman dot com.
[06:03:30] <nFFF> Debug experts, Im trying to follow some code, I need to figure out when I click on an image what javascript is bound to that event
[06:03:34] <nFFF> Any easy way of doing this
[06:03:36] <mikecmpbll> this doesn't help me specifically though, as what i've done works
[06:03:42] <mikecmpbll> except this problem with the datepicker
[06:04:20] <mikecmpbll> if i have ben alman's "click outside" event on the div, and i click on the datepicker, it will trigger that event also?
[06:04:22] <seutje> nFFF: chrome (maybe only canary build) allows u to break on *all* events
[06:04:48] <seutje> nFFF: also, see ?g visualevent
[06:04:49] <Raydiation> i kinda hate that this is a lib :)
[06:04:55] <bot-t> nFFF, Allan Jardine | Reflections | Visual Event - http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[06:05:24] <nFFF> thanks seutje shall look into it
[06:05:35] <seutje> it's a lil bookmarklet that marks regions that have event handlers, exposing the  handler upon hovering
[06:05:59] <seutje> it doesn't work for everything, but I do believe jQuery events and good ol' DOM events are supported
[06:07:16] <seutje> nFFF: also, for jQuery events: $(element)._data('events') shows an object of all event types and their handlers and such, like $(element)._data('events').click[0].handler would show you the function for the first click handler bound to that element by jquery
[06:09:54] <Cody__> Sorry for disturbing you here, but I am just a jquery beginner (noob) and don't understand why I cannot chose a CSS span class with jquery…
[06:11:25] <jost> Cody__, can you give an example or code snippet?
[06:11:43] <Cody__> yes! It is very simple, only five lines:
[06:11:59] <Cody__> 		$(function() { 			$(".lista").next(".list")();  			$(".lista").click(function(){ 				$(this).next(".list").slideToggle(); 				}); 		});
[06:12:14] <Cody__> .lista and .list are span classes
[06:12:17] <seutje> what's that extra () after the next?
[06:12:53] <Cody__> this is a span class that should be displayed again after  a click
[06:13:03] <seutje> what's this suppose to do: $(".lista").next(".list")(); ?
[06:15:13] <Cody__> seutje: mmh indeed something's missing. Just noticed that isnt my latest version
[06:15:22] <bahamas> Cody__: putting your code in a paste would make it easier to read
[06:16:19] <Cody__> ok, here is my last try:
[06:16:21] <Cody__> 		$(function() {
[06:16:25] <seutje> Cody__: http://jsbin.com/ayijol/1/edit
[06:17:28] <Cody__> mmh seutje thanks for your help
[06:17:36] <Cody__> I will check if this can help me
[06:21:32] <bamarni> hi, I have a modal form using the jquery ui dialog plugin, it contains a textarea and has a submit button (configured through the plugin "buttons" option) and I'd like to set this button disabled unless the textarea is not empty, but I don't have any clue on how to do that, because this button is created by jquery, I don't know which selector to apply when 'm on textarea's change event callback.
[06:23:37] <Cody__> seutje: Ok I will help myself now I think. Thank you for helping n00bs as me
[06:24:09] <seutje> Cody__: it's the least I can do while photosoup is loading up this PSD from hell
[06:26:20] <Raydiation> mikecmpbll: solved it
[06:26:36] <Raydiation> mikecmpbll: is it already working for you?
[06:30:02] <mikecmpbll> nope.
[06:30:23] <mikecmpbll> :)
[06:33:41] <Raydiation> mikecmpbll: im using this: http://dpaste.org/tpIfk/
[06:33:41] <Kingsy> Cork: you still around?
[06:34:14] <mikecmpbll> Raydiation: cheers, i'll take a look.
[06:34:14] <Raydiation> mikecmpbll: can be applied by using <div click-slide-toggle="{selector: '.add-new-popup',	hideOnFocusLost: true }">
[06:34:22] <mikecmpbll> ok
[06:34:26] <Raydiation> youll need angularjs
[06:34:45] <mikecmpbll> looks a bit overkill for me.
[06:35:21] <Raydiation> angularjs?
[06:35:41] <mikecmpbll> the whole solution, as i only have one very specific problem at the mo'
[06:35:57] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/WmZtd/ -- When clicking both "Test 1" and "Test 2", is there any way to reduce the space between the two paragraphs? I could switch from padding to margin so that the space collapses, but then I lose the background. I could add another wrapper and put the background on that instead, but then I don't know how to do the whole slideToggle thing?
[06:36:02] <boytoy> The problem is that the order of the two paragraphs changes depending on which link is clicked first, so I can't just assign different paddings to each paragraph.
[06:36:15] <Raydiation> mikecmpbll: well ive generalized the slideup thing because we need it a lot in oC
[06:36:15] <Kingsy> if I have a function that seems to run async to the rest of the code once its called, whats the best way of waiting for that async code to finish before you move on? I.e decide if you want the code to run async or not...
[06:36:38] <Raydiation> Kingsy: callback
[06:36:59] <Raydiation> theres also the promise pattern
[06:37:49] <delboy1978uk> anyone here use pajinate?
[06:37:54] <solars> hey, I've got a function (codemirror) that accepts an argument returned with document.getElementById - how can I insert a jqyery object like $("#fu") there? (e.g. returned with .each?)
[06:38:48] <Kingsy> Raydiation: I think the offending function is --> $("#zoom1").data('zoom', new CloudZoom($("#zoom1"), opts)); <-- so how would I add a callback to that?
[06:39:18] <delboy1978uk> solars $("irc://irc.freenode.org/#fu").html('stuff to put in #fu');
[06:39:43] <delboy1978uk> ? dont know where that link came from it should just say #fu :-P
[06:39:44] <Raydiation> Kingsy: is CloudZoom async?
[06:39:50] <bot-t> delboy1978uk, #10160 (AJAX errors are not reported in Firefox Error console ... - Opened 18 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10160#fu :-P
[06:39:55] <solars> hm but thats not what I want to do
[06:40:13] <Kingsy> Raydiation: I really don'tknow tbh, but I am getting VERY stange results in a browser, so it kinda has to be
[06:40:13] <solars> I just want to get the same thing returned by $(fubar).something as document.getElementById() gives me
[06:40:41] <Raydiation> Kingsy: check if it takes a callback function
[06:41:10] <Kingsy> Raydiation: it doesnt
[06:41:19] <Raydiation> Kingsy: then youre fked
[06:41:42] <Kingsy> Raydiation: so there is no way of executing it, waiting until its finished then moving on?
[06:41:42] <delboy1978uk> $('#idhere');  is like document.getElementById('#idhere') is it not?
[06:42:01] <Raydiation> Kingsy: only if it returns a promise
[06:42:06] <solars> if I use it, codemirror returns no such function .getAttribute
[06:42:19] <solars> with document.getElementById it seems to work
[06:42:32] <Raydiation> Kingsy: basically something that allows you to pass in a callback
[06:42:35] <Alexandru> Hey there :)
[06:42:35] <Kambfhase> delboy1978uk: exactly
[06:43:18] <Alexandru> Short question: IS there any way to write a jQuery script that executes something IF the <body> of a document contains a <div> having a certain .class ?
[06:44:16] <Kambfhase> if( $('div.class').length > 0){ doStuff(); }

[06:48:42] <Kingsy> Raydiation: you cant edit the function to do what is needed?
[06:48:52] <ionas> any reason that /* $.ajaxSetup({error: function(jqXHR, exception) {  */ …. exception == "error" if the user presses escape or navigates to another page while an XHR request is going on?
[06:48:57] <ionas> should it not be == "abort"?
[06:49:02] <Kingsy> Raydiation: see, I cant really think of another way around this, its a really really strange problem.
[06:49:05] <masentinel900> I need to know how can I put a simple loading bar while to do a proccess with ajax jquery?
[06:49:08] <Alexandru> Okay, it works great Kambfhase. Ty :). Just be sure, is there a server-side alternative?
[06:49:32] <Kingsy> Raydiation: if you have a few moments I can explain the issue in full? perhaps you could offer some guidence?
[06:49:59] <Kambfhase> Alexandru: sure, debending on your serverside language that should be doable. but dont ask me, how.
[06:50:04] <Raydiation> Kingsy: what is CloudZoom
[06:50:15] <Alexandru> ok :)
[06:51:30] <Kingsy> Raydiation: its basically a library that allows a user to have a zoomed window of a larger image.
[06:51:45] <josuebc> Hi there, I am trying to retrieve a timeline from a twitter user. I already have the api correctly constructed. I know this because if I type it in my web browser's address bar I get the JSON object. I am using $.getJSON(url); the thing is that it doesn't get anything back, firebug shows it only stays trying to proces the answer but theres nothing there. Until a tmieout occurs. any ideas why this is happening?
[06:52:39] <ionas> this makes me insane
[06:52:48] <delboy1978uk> solars dont use getAttribute, use .attr()
[06:53:00] <Kingsy> Raydiation: check this out --> http://pastie.org/6130926 <-- that is the click function with the issue..   basically if you add   alert("HELLO");   calls at various points throughout the call it works great.
[06:53:51] <Kingsy> Raydiation: you can see the code execute from point to point, it basically hides the image, gets a new wdith and height, sets them, enables the zoomer for the new image after destroying the old one, then displays... it works great. (with alerts)
[06:54:38] <Raydiation> Kingsy: i cant help you if i dont see the CloudZoom source
[06:55:07] <Kingsy> Raydiation: well its pretty long, but sure I can pastie it for ua
[06:55:08] <Kingsy> ya
[06:55:09] <Kingsy> 1 sec
[06:55:11] <Raydiation> if thats the stuff that does async stuff
[06:56:22] <Kingsy> Raydiation: ok, here --> http://pastie.org/6131051 <-- the click function I am dealing with is on line 365 of that pastie... that is the entire file encluding the source and the event bindings.
[06:57:07] <ionas> if ((jqXHR.status == 0 && jqXHR.readyState == 0) || exception == 'abort') { return } is ok?
[06:57:14] <mikecmpbll> ok chaps, this is my problem in a nutshell
[06:57:16] <mikecmpbll> http://jsfiddle.net/6UnLa/
[06:57:18] <ionas> it seems query is buggy here :E
[06:57:20] <ionas> :(
[06:57:30] <mikecmpbll> when you click on the date picker calendar, the div closes.
[06:57:57] <ionas> and then: what's the standard timeout for query XHR ?
[06:58:17] <mikecmpbll> argh, nevermind
[06:58:26] <mikecmpbll> got it..
[07:00:29] <Kingsy> Raydiation: what do you think ?
[07:00:39] <ionas> is 30 seconds timeout ok?
[07:00:41] <Raydiation> Kingsy: is line 97 important
[07:01:05] <Kingsy> Raydiation: yes, the control loop manages the zoom window.
[07:01:23] <Raydiation> so your stuff has to execute after this
[07:01:52] <dblosevn> josuebc: is the domain your api resides on the same as the domain the api resides on?
[07:01:52] <Kingsy> hrm, no, thats not what I thought
[07:01:58] <brend_> dblosevn: ..
[07:02:09] <Kingsy> Raydiation: basically, the init process needs to be complete before my code does.
[07:02:10] <dblosevn> yay brend_ :-)
[07:02:12] <Kingsy> thats about it
[07:02:23] <Kingsy> Raydiation: the actual use of the zoomer doesnt not matter.
[07:02:36] <brend_> dblosevn: need ur assistance
[07:02:48] <dblosevn> got a lil hotty commin over in a few minutes for some quality break time, so it will have to be fast
[07:02:56] <Kingsy> Raydiation: so I would say, like 147 was important, I need to execute AFTER it has init
[07:03:02] <brend_> oookok
[07:03:22] <Raydiation> Kingsy: then you need to pass a callback function to that function
[07:03:33] <Raydiation> and execute it at the end of the code
[07:03:38] <Kingsy> Raydiation: yeah, I am kinda unsure how to do that.
[07:04:10] <Raydiation> Kingsy: http://recurial.com/programming/understanding-callback-functions-in-javascript/
[07:04:12] <dblosevn> brend_: well spit it out
[07:04:24] <brend_> dblosevn:  im generating fields automatically.. each field is an autocomplete.. for some reason when it loops it only gets the first field id http://jsfiddle.net/W9EUQ/2/
[07:04:47] <brend_> dblosevn:  in the autocomplete
[07:05:09] <dblosevn> brend_: show me an example response
[07:05:27] <brend_> dblosevn:  what do u mean
[07:05:43] <dblosevn> what does this response look like? http://localhost:8080/tesis/controllers/addprojectsController.php?employee=1
[07:05:57] <brend_> dblosevn:  [{"id":"1","value":"Andres"},{"id":"2","value":"Fede"}]
[07:06:48] <Kingsy> Raydiation: hrm ok I THINK I see.
[07:07:08] <chris____> On my page I have a gigantic form with many repeated elements.  Is there a jquery plugin that will allow the page to keep posting in the background as the user is entering information?
[07:09:46] <NoiseEee> chris____: i guess that would just be a regular XHR/ajax post ?
[07:13:24] <arkiver> I want to add font color to the  bold "required" field in : $('#required_'+elements[i]).append('<b>   Required!</b>'); How can I specify style within this ?
[07:14:24] <arkiver> Basically I want "Required" should be in red.  I defined style inline in the <b> element but is not working.
[07:14:52] <arkiver> How can I do that ?
[07:15:47] <NoiseEee> arkiver: you should be using a stylesheet, to be honest
[07:15:55] <NoiseEee> and then you add <b class='required'>Required!</b>
[07:16:30] <arkiver> NoiseEee, I am using. But I am trying to add validations on form submit and give notice for fields which are left blank.
[07:16:50] <NoiseEee> arkiver: so have a class called "required" that can be defined as red text, and add/remove it when necessary
[07:16:56] <NoiseEee> arkiver: inline styles should be avoided
[07:17:23] <NoiseEee> $(myElement).addClass('required');
[07:17:35] <arkiver> NoiseEee, hmm. will do that.  Thanks
[07:17:43] <ionas> <em>Required</em>
[07:17:55] <ionas> <strong>required</strong>
[07:18:48] <Antiga> You shouldn't be using b or em tags if you have the class in there.
[07:18:55] <Antiga> Use a span or div and bold it with the CSS.
[07:19:19] <NoiseEee> its funny that both <b> and <i> have made it to html5
[07:19:25] <Antiga> Means nothing.
[07:20:33] <snagnever> hey! how/where can i find the instance of a plugin so i can change some attributes on the fly? for instance, i'm using the RATY plugin to a star rating. i wanted to change a configuration onmouseover of that
[07:31:52] <brend__> wrapper
[07:36:07] <scarlet_razor> hi...
[07:36:10] <scarlet_razor> good night...
[07:37:02] <scarlet_razor> i load new html page after ajax post... my question why the previous jquery script that i wrote is not available again ?
[07:41:39] <AdamPDotty> new site, new script
[07:41:41] <AdamPDotty> no xss
[07:41:50] <Kingsy> this is impossible.
[07:42:42] <scarlet_razor> AdamPDotty:  sorry guy are u talking with me ?
[07:44:01] <gotwig> good morning USA :D
[07:44:34] <gotwig> basicly I want to apply that here on my website
[07:44:38] <gotwig> but I have a few problems
[07:44:39] <gotwig> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2867479/limiting-number-of-characters-in-a-contenteditable-div
[07:45:15] <gotwig> www.bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[07:45:20] <gotwig> dblosevn, hello Mister :D
[07:51:51] <brend__> uf
[07:52:28] <gotwig> omg
[07:52:29] <gotwig> onkeypress="return (this.innerText.length <= 256)"
[07:52:35] <gotwig> is such a perfect solution
[07:52:40] <gotwig> have never thought about that
[07:53:56] <JesterJ85> this may or may not be a dumb question...I'm in the process of debugging my script...but is there a default timeout that the ajax function of jquery uses? Back story: I'm writing a php script that goes out and gets information, and returns the information to jquery, which spits it out to the page. Since I incorporated an image feature in the php script, I've been getting returned to the error function of my ajax call. The image featu
[07:54:51] <JesterJ85> if* the ajax call has a default timeout
[07:56:49] <gotwig> JesterJ85, have you tried that? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2507355/jquery-ajax-call-default-timeout-value
[07:57:54] <JesterJ85> actually I have (Kind of funny because I have that exact page up in a tab) Which is actually what led me to the possible conclusion
[07:58:12] <JesterJ85> err...sry..haven't tried it yet as I'm running my script one last time before I try it
[07:58:20] <eaz> Is it possible to append trust badge scripts with jquery? I have tried numerous ways but the scripts don't place a badge on the page.
[07:59:39] <codecowboy> should it be possible to add additional fields to a form inside the submit function i.e. $('#form').submit(function(add field here;)   ?)
[08:02:38] <JesterJ85> codecowboy: What if you did it on a click function? $("#form").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $("#this_selector").append("<input type='text' name='new_field' />");
[08:04:47] <mandarks> $('#elem').css('height'); returning nothing in ie8. I thinks its probably because the element is set to display none, How can i get the height of this element without positioning it outside the window or doing something really hacky???
[08:08:38] <mandarks> Anyone?
[08:08:46] <codecowboy> JesterJ85, its for mobile devices. Are you saying its not possible?
[08:09:00] <jcp_> mandarks: maybe set opacity to 0 instead of none?
[08:09:58] <fRAiLtY-> Is there an easy way to get this to count to midnight from midnight ? http://jsfiddle.net/pPKX2/1/
[08:10:08] <gotwig> folks, can you tell me if there is an event, that happens when you like focused out an element? Like after entering text..?
[08:10:29] <mandarks> jcp_: but as the elements relative, and has accordion functionality, in its closed state it will display as opened.
[08:10:32] <JesterJ85> gotwig: onBlur
[08:10:40] <JesterJ85> codecowboy: it is definitely possible
[08:10:54] <gotwig> JesterJ85, thanks mister
[08:10:57] <JesterJ85> just depends on how you want to accomplish it
[08:12:14] <jcp_> mandarks: take a look at this may give you some ideas: https://github.com/dreamerslab/jquery.actual
[08:12:36] <gotwig> JesterJ85, Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'onBlur'
[08:13:11] <mandarks> jcp_: Thanks man
[08:13:13] <JesterJ85> gotwig: perhaps check your selector
[08:13:31] <gotwig> JesseC, its a contentEditable thing
[08:13:36] <gotwig> in a p tag
[08:14:23] <JesterJ85> and actually sorry I believe the actual event is just $("#selector").blur(function(){})
[08:14:33] <JesterJ85> http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[08:14:41] <JesterJ85> onBlur was javascript
[08:15:03] <gotwig> isnt it like The event handler can be bound to the first input field:
[08:15:03] <gotwig> $('#target').blur(function() {
[08:15:03] <gotwig>   alert('Handler for .blur() called.');
[08:15:03] <gotwig> }); ?
[08:15:10] <gotwig> yeah
[08:15:51] <JesterJ85> yes every time you leave an input field, the blur event is called
[08:16:06] <JesterJ85> if you call it on a class, then all elements with that class would call the blur event once you leave it
[08:16:07] <gotwig> but it works with every thing, not just input..?
[08:16:35] <JesterJ85> anything that can be focused on, once it loses focus I would imagine calls it yes
[08:17:33] <gotwig> JesterJ85, hm do you want to look at my code?
[08:17:52] <gotwig> of course, everyone here wants =)
[08:18:13] <JesterJ85> sure, throw it in a pastebin
[08:18:13] <gotwig> better look at the whole document, here: www.bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[08:18:24] <gotwig> JesterJ85, there are a lot of dependencies.. so
[08:18:25] <JesterJ85> gotcha
[08:18:40] <gotwig> like going here and there
[08:18:56] <gotwig> JesterJ85, before that, I actually used .save , but now I want to replace it
[08:19:01] <fRAiLtY-> dblosevn:  o/
[08:19:06] <gotwig> with only the text field, as I think that is way more sexy
[08:19:23] <Teduardo> How can I get the id tag off of the button clicked for .click?
[08:20:11] <JesterJ85> gotwig: wheres the selector that has the blur function?
[08:20:14] <gotwig> Teduardo, something like var id = $(this).id('content-id'); ...
[08:20:17] <gotwig> or var id = $(this).data('content-id');
[08:20:23] <gotwig> but here I used data as attribute
[08:20:40] <gotwig> JesterJ85, $(".text").blur
[08:21:19] <JesterJ85> Teduardo: $("#selector").click(function(){ var id =  $(this).attr('id'); } );
[08:21:34] <gotwig> yeah...
[08:22:07] <gotwig> JesterJ85, actually, if you focus another text element, it works
[08:22:11] <gotwig> JesterJ85, see?
[08:22:22] <gotwig> JesterJ85, it says, text saved
[08:23:08] <JesterJ85> gotwig: I see that, it doesn't do it on the class quote
[08:23:16] <gotwig> yeah
[08:23:22] <gotwig> I havent added that yet
[08:23:26] <JesterJ85> gotcha
[08:23:38] <JesterJ85> well the blur functionality seems to be working though
[08:24:42] <JesterJ85> the jquery site says you can apply it on a paragraph, I just don't see how it can be 'focused' on that element
[08:24:58] <brend__> is there anyway to check why $(this).next().val(ui.item.id); is not getting the corresponded id in this code http://jsfiddle.net/W9EUQ/3/
[08:25:27] <gotwig> JesterJ85, or better, how it can be not focused
[08:25:46] <gotwig> JesterJ85, when you focus it, its focused, if you choose another text field, its unfocused
[08:25:52] <gotwig> and not after you select the background
[08:26:07] <_dave_h_d> hi all anyone knows a good touch slider plugin, i am after one similar to m.techcrunch.com
[08:26:39] <v0lZy> guys, I have a <div><a></a><span></span></div> setup and I animate something when I mouseouver div ... My entire block is an anchor, however, if i move over the <span> which is also a block, i seem to trigger the animation again... ... I dont want to do that. Help?
[08:26:41] <JesterJ85> hmmmm
[08:27:08] <Teduardo> gotwig: this is what I came up with? basically it should pop a confirm that says "are you sure that you wish to shutdown 209.190.1.122?" http://jsfiddle.net/DPf7R/ any clue what i'm doing wrong?
[08:28:05] <gotwig> JesterJ85, do you like the look of the site?
[08:29:11] <gotwig> Teduardo, I never did confirms, sry
[08:29:16] <gotwig> I only used alert windows
[08:30:07] <Brodingo> Teduardo .id() is not a method
[08:31:04] <JesterJ85> In this case I don't think blur would be your friend...you wouldn't be able to track when they click into another box. Perhaps a click even on the background wrapper, that if text was changed in .text then display the message
[08:31:12] <gotwig> Teduardo, yeah use (this).attr('id');
[08:31:30] <gotwig> Teduardo, I gave you before that a wrong code... I said its only for data attributes, like data-id
[08:31:31] <gotwig> not id
[08:31:47] <brend__> ?
[08:32:17] <gotwig> JesterJ85, and save as well, huh?
[08:33:25] <JesterJ85> Gotwig: yea...you could run another function on the click event of the background
[08:33:51] <gotwig> JesterJ85, but that is crazy :D
[08:35:45] <gotwig> JesterJ85, lol, sometimes it works
[08:35:47] <gotwig> JesterJ85, ?
[08:36:08] <gotwig> well it doesnt save XD
[08:36:11] <gotwig> but I get the message :D
[08:36:58] <JesterJ85> hmmm...did you try to pull the saving functionality into a separate method, and then calling that method on the background click?
[08:37:31] <gotwig> JesterJ85, no, I do something other :>
[08:37:37] <gotwig> JesterJ85, anyway, thx for the help
[08:37:43] <JesterJ85> anytime!
[08:37:45] <gotwig> I think I can build a kingdom from here :>
[08:37:59] <gotwig> JesterJ85, do you like the site?
[08:38:03] <gotwig> JesterJ85, the look...
[08:38:24] <JesterJ85> anything is possible with the right amount of determination...and money. Yea I mean it's not bad...I don't quite know the purpose or anything
[08:38:31] <jasonthesensei> Quick question I have an ordered list of 40 items and I want to group them in 2s but in a random order
[08:38:39] <gotwig> JesterJ85, well, its my college work
[08:39:46] <JesterJ85> good luck with it! it does look like it has potential...a lot more dynamic than my college stuff....which basically made me hate forms
[08:41:16] <gotwig> JesterJ85, I guess you had XHTML or so :D
[08:42:16] <JesterJ85> yea...and straight javascript..jquery not allowed
[08:42:31] <jasonthesensei> hmmm thinking I could take the ol and turn it into an array then randomize it
[08:43:11] <awc737> why can't I use .on('click'... with a cloned element?
[08:44:10] <JesterJ85> awc737: are you sure it is getting properly selected?
[08:44:26] <awc737> yeah definitely, $("a").on('click', function(e) {
[08:44:45] <awc737> all other links are alerting, and I have one copy of the element, which is not a clone
[08:44:48] <awc737> only the cloned elements don't register
[08:45:23] <jasonthesensei> something like this
[08:45:25] <jasonthesensei> var item = items[Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)];
[08:45:37] <jasonthesensei> am i on the right track?
[08:46:26] <JesterJ85> awc737: how are you cloning them?
[08:46:46] <awc737> var clone = $(thisDiv).find('fieldset:first').clone();
[08:46:52] <awc737> clone.appendTo(thisDiv);
[08:46:52] <jasonthesensei> nm  got it working thanks
[08:47:39] <awc737> .clone(true); seems to have fixed it
[08:47:41] <brend__> is there anyway to check why $(this).next().val(ui.item.id); is not getting the corresponded id in this code http://jsfiddle.net/W9EUQ/3/

[08:56:45] <sarathdr> Hi All
[08:56:51] <gotwig> sarathdr, jo
[08:57:01] <gotwig> JesterJ85, how can I select more than one class?
[08:57:10] <gotwig> like $(".text" + ".quote")
[08:57:11] <gotwig> ?
[08:57:30] <sarathdr> I need to impplment a slider for touch devices same like jquery mobile slider
[08:57:30] <Brodingo> $(".text, .quote")
[08:57:36] <JesterJ85> like css, $(".text, .quote").
[08:57:43] <v0lZy> Guys, can somone give me some advice on how to prevent a animation trigger when hovering from child to parent element or from parent to child element?
[08:58:15] <sarathdr> but I do not need all properties of jMobile
[08:58:16] <gotwig> thx
[08:59:14] <sarathdr> is there anyway to extract the slider code from jquery mobile
[08:59:17] <gotwig> works
[08:59:17] <gotwig> thx
[08:59:38] <evaluate> Hello.
[08:59:50] <gotwig> evaluate, WELCOME
[09:00:05] <sarathdr> any idea ?
[09:00:24] <evaluate> I have multiple elements on my page that have a class like 'validate[something]', is there a way to select these elements with jQuery? $('.validate') doesn't seem to get these...
[09:00:31] <JesterJ85> sarathdr: anything is possible...just highly not recommended...if you were to use a minimized js it shouldn't have that much of an effect
[09:00:43] <awc737> is there a way to say $(each).(div).EXCEPT:first
[09:01:20] <sarathdr> but it overrides some other events
[09:01:26] <evaluate> awc737, there's a :not selector, might want to have a look at that...
[09:01:39] <sarathdr> JesterJ85: it overrides some other evevnts
[09:01:39] <awc737> evaluate: :not:first?
[09:01:41] <Brodingo> awc737 $('div:not(:first)').each(fn)
[09:02:06] <awc737> hmm, its wierd sometimes .each comes before selector, sometimes after?
[09:02:14] <Brodingo> it depends
[09:02:29] <Brodingo> theres an each utility that jquery has
[09:02:32] <Brodingo> $.each()
[09:03:19] <JesterJ85> I mean you could open the script and parse it out manually, but you may ommit something or leave out a dependancy...I'd look into possibly running the events, or including the over-ridden scripts after you include the mobile script
[09:03:51] <awc737> Brodingo: thats different than $('div').each(fn) ?
[09:03:56] <awc737> $.each('div', function(k, v){
[09:04:03] <awc737> same statement?
[09:04:21] <Brodingo> no, $.each() is a 'generic iteration function'
[09:04:42] <Brodingo> .each() is for iterating over a jquery collection
[09:04:45] <sarathdr> JesterJ85: I tried to import the file and added the jmobile compoent
[09:05:07] <sarathdr> but it never works for specific contril we should use the whole frame work
[09:05:13] <awc737> ok Brodingo so for dom elements, I need the other way?
[09:05:29] <Brodingo> yep its best that way
[09:11:28] <sarathdr> Please let me know if there is  a way to implement jquery touch mobile slider control wihtout jquery mobile framework
[09:13:40] <JesterJ85> try using jGestures instead. http://jgestures.codeplex.com/
[09:16:19] <sarathdr> is there any quick way to integrate ?
[09:17:18] <JesterJ85> to be honest I haven't used it personally...but it should follow the same conventions
[09:19:57] <Tixz> I recently (< 3 months) saw a new date picker script on HackerNews which had a very clean UI and decent API. Does anyone have a clue or can recommend other lightweight candidates?
[09:20:40] <jme> Hi,  I need to find the correct way to select only the first child element? I have some nested <ul> tags, and I'm trying to figure out how to expand just the first level of each set of hidden children, so it works kind of like a CSS menu, but only on click of the menu item's list icon. Any thoughts?
[09:20:51] <beasty> hi guys
[09:21:03] <beasty> i' m pondering if there is a way to transfer a large amount of data
[09:21:22] <beasty> crossdomain using jsonp
[09:22:00] <Tixz> jme: $('ul li').first() ?
[09:22:24] <Tixz> beasty: Care to elaborate?
[09:24:07] <awc737> how can I do something like this: $(thisDiv + ' fieldset:not(:first)').each(
[09:24:12] <awc737> concatonate within the element selector
[09:24:34] <BillCris_> beasty: Are you sending data to another domain or receiving it?
[09:24:35] <jme> Tixz: I thought I tried that, but I may have typoed
[09:25:18] <Tixz> awc737: $(thisDiv).find('fieldset:not(:first)').each()
[09:25:53] <awc737> thanks Tixz , but what is the difference between that and $('#thisDiv fieldset etc...
[09:26:07] <Tixz> awc737: Arr I misuderstood you
[09:26:49] <Tixz> I thought thisDiv was a variable holding an element, and you then wanted to restrict your selection to that
[09:26:53] <awc737> Tixz: I believe your answer is correct. thisDiv is a variable.
[09:27:05] <BillCris_> awc737: You can use :gt() as well.
[09:27:10] <awc737> yes your right, but doesn't '#thisDiv fieldset do the same thing?
[09:27:13] <rasta> Sympa son blog http://camille.serveblog.net/ :)
[09:27:27] <Tixz> $('thisDiv') refers to the html element with id thisDiv?
[09:27:44] <awc737> yes, the variable holds an element
[09:27:52] <Tixz> But you're inside a string
[09:28:43] <awc737> true
[09:28:51] <BillCris_> awc737: The first thing Tixz suggested would be right, I think thisDiv.find('fieldset:gt(0)') is easier to read, though.
[09:29:20] <Brodingo> awc737 if its a jquery object use thisDiv.find() if its an element use $(thisDiv).find(), if its a string use the selector concatenation
[09:29:52] <awc737> thanks guys, I get it now
[09:30:02] <awc737> but Brodingo on your last example, whats the difference between a jquery object and an element
[09:30:12] <awc737> both cases are variable objects correct
[09:30:27] <Brodingo> a jquery object is created with $(), and element is a raw HTML element
[09:30:38] <awc737> which one is this: http://paste.laravel.com/hnW
[09:30:48] <awc737> a raw HTML element store in a JS variable, you mean?
[09:30:59] <Tixz> it's a jQuery object
[09:31:00] <BillCris_> awc737: It's a jQuery object.
[09:31:06] <Brodingo> .find() is a jquery method that returns a jquery object
[09:31:10] <Brodingo> so the var is a jquery object
[09:31:19] <Brodingo> so you can use jquery methods without rewrapping it with jquery
[09:31:22] <BillCris_> awc737: You don't need to do $(thisDiv), thisDiv.find() is is better.
[09:31:49] <awc737> I am just curious to understand. how would I get an element instead of jQuery object from my example
[09:31:56] <BillCris_> thisDiv.find('fieldset:gt(0)').remove()
[09:32:39] <BillCris_> awc737: If you want the element without jQuery do thisDiv[0], but you probably don't want that.
[09:33:15] <awc737> oh ok, yeah so case 2 will probably never be the case
[09:33:25] <awc737> in your 3 case example
[09:34:20] <asac_> In JQM, If I execute code in here "$(document).delegate('#page-slideshow', 'pageinit', function() { ...  });" it is only the run first time, If the same page is loaded again with ajax it wont get run the second time. How do I execute code each time a page is loaded with ajax in JQM?
[09:34:58] <brend__> is there anyway to check why $(this).next().val(ui.item.id); is not getting the corresponded id in this code http://jsfiddle.net/W9EUQ/3/
[09:35:29] <brend__> for some reason this way it does work fine http://jsfiddle.net/pK78z/2/
[09:38:04] <asac_> also some of the docs for JQM are still using .live()
[09:38:27] <BillCriswell> brend__: Just be careful you know what this is.
[09:38:53] <brend__> BillCriswell:  what do u mean
[09:38:57] <limpc> i have a problem with a colorbox, where I am trying to implement an autocomplete which uses divs to build the autocomplete dropdown list.  However, they get hidden inside the colorbox content div.  How do I make them pop outside of that?
[09:39:33] <Brodingo> limpc overflow:hidden is set on colorbox
[09:40:46] <BillCriswell> brend__: Do console.log(this) in both cases and and make sure "this" is what you think it is.
[09:40:48] <limpc> Brodingo: its set to auto, not hidden
[09:41:18] <Brodingo> limpc you sure about that?
[09:41:27] <limpc> yes i checked via firebug
[09:42:03] <limpc> i have div:after .. div:before css on divs to avoid needing to use overflow:hidden
[09:42:04] <Brodingo> limpc did you check all of the container elements?
[09:44:03] <limpc> Brodingo: yes, only the popup window container itself has overflow:hidden still set.  however, although that will be a problem, it's not whats currently causing the issue, since content is disappearing underneath the cboxContent container which doesnt have overflow:hidden set
[09:44:10] <brend__> BillCriswell:  i have never used the console.. but is this the response i should get Object[input.input-medium] ?
[09:44:25] <limpc> maybe because it's overflow:auto?
[09:45:30] <Brodingo> limpc anything besides visible will clip the visual area
[09:45:39] <asac_> never mind I tnink pagebeforeshow is what i'm looking for..
[09:45:54] <maxmoore14> with jqm, when does the url get updated in the page lifecycle?
[09:46:07] <maxmoore14> I'm trying to pass a param through the querystring
[09:46:25] <maxmoore14> test.htm?id=1
[09:46:57] <maxmoore14> if this is not the suggested method, what is? Should I set a global var before changing the page?
[09:48:44] <BillCriswell> How about for the other example?
[09:49:14] <maxmoore14> I was just reading that query params are not supported, I figured
[09:49:27] <maxmoore14> but what is the best practice for passing a param to a page?
[09:50:28] <maxmoore14> or should I use data-ajax=false for the link?
[09:52:01] <brend__> BillCriswell:  same thing.. i have tried using a css selector and works but only with the first field generated since these fields are generated dinamically.. so when i add a second one the first field change it value for the second one
[09:53:01] <brend__> BillCriswell:  still wonder why works in jsfiddle and not in my code
[09:53:30] <BillCriswell> brend__: Hard to tell without a live example. Are there any errors?
[09:55:30] <brend__> BillCriswell:  algo this is the respond i get with the source..[{"id":"1","value":"Andres"},{"id":"2","value":"Fede"}] which is the same json i setup in the example
[09:55:56] <BillCriswell> Yeah that looks cool, but are there any other errors?
[09:56:05] <brend__> BillCriswell:  no errors
[09:57:39] <limpc> Brodingo: i changed every overflow: to 'visible' and it still hides content
[09:58:13] <limpc> ah nm found one last item
[09:58:18] <Brodingo> i think color box also sets overflow hidden as a style on cboxLoadedContent
[09:58:28] <Brodingo> so you might need to !important that
[10:03:42] <goddard> I was using on focus out to do some confirmation on my form to show a next button
[10:03:48] <maxmoore14> anyone know about page linking in JQM? I need to know best practice for passing params to pages.
[10:03:49] <goddard> but i get to the last step a checkbox
[10:03:58] <goddard> and it doesn't register a focusout
[10:04:25] <goddard> what is universal event for input text boxes selects and check boxes when they are focus out type event
[10:05:48] <gotwig> goddard, focus out?
[10:05:53] <gotwig> goddard, normally blur I guess
[10:05:58] <gotwig> .blur
[10:06:42] <gotwig> goddard, http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[10:07:16] <goddard> blur isn't working for me
[10:07:25] <goddard> the event never gets triggered
[10:07:41] <goddard> i am using var fields = $("#js_form :input");
[10:07:52] <goddard> to loop over all my elements and make sure they are completed
[10:10:13] <boytoy> Anybody know why this simple Masonry image gallery http://bit.ly/VR7Lt7 crashes on the default Android browser as soon as all the images are loaded?
[10:10:32] <goddard> normally i would just do an attr('checked')
[10:10:39] <goddard> but that doesn't wanna work
[10:10:59] <goddard> since it is inside the blur event
[10:11:07] <goddard> or the focus out event
[10:11:39] <goddard> i mean we have $('input[type="checkbox"]').on('change', function() {
[10:11:47] <goddard> but that won't work for a input text box
[10:14:03] <bahamas> goddard: why wouldn't it work for a text box?
[10:14:45] <goddard> bahamas because the event would fire every time you type
[10:14:52] <goddard> that is a little much
[10:15:44] <goddard> right?
[10:17:33] <bahamas> yeah, you're right
[10:18:17] <bahamas> goddard: why don't you loop when the user presses a button? or you're already doing that?
[10:19:04] <goddard> bahamas, I'm doing now with the change function and that works great no speed decrease but i am wondering about my users with slow computers
[10:19:45] <bahamas> goddard: what change function?
[10:20:34] <goddard> query has a change function
[10:23:22] <goddard> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:23:29] <bahamas> goddard: ok, so what's the problem again? I missed the beginning of what you said
[10:24:03] <goddard> just wondering about speed on js
[10:24:13] <goddard> will it hit slow computers hard or how does that work?
[10:25:54] <bahamas> goddard: well, you're attaching a handler to an event. I don't see anything exceptional about it
[10:26:04] <goddard> ok
[10:26:11] <goddard> then i guess its fine
[10:26:13] <goddard> thanks
[10:26:33] <maxmoore14> what is the best practice for passing a param to a page in jqm?
[10:32:06] <bahamas> maxmoore14: what do you mean? jqm=jquery mobile, btw?
[10:32:07] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:32:36] <maxmoore14> bahamas: jqm=jquery mobile, yes
[10:32:58] <maxmoore14> query string params are not supported by jquery
[10:33:04] <maxmoore14> jqm that is
[10:33:23] <maxmoore14> so, I need to be able to pass some data to a page for dynamic load
[10:33:32] <maxmoore14> if I can't do page.htm?id=1
[10:33:36] <maxmoore14> then what is the best way?
[10:34:11] <maxmoore14> one option that works is using data-ajax="false" on the link
[10:34:18] <maxmoore14> just not sure that is the best way to go
[10:38:08] <goddard> i got another hard one
[10:38:11] <goddard> at least for me
[10:38:34] <goddard> i can click on a select box and change the option selected and it loads another select box
[10:38:52] <kamo> Does anyone have a good reference for jquery and iframes
[10:39:08] <goddard> but if i select the option manually using .attr('selected', true); and then .trigger('change');
[10:39:21] <goddard> it doesn't load the other select box
[10:39:41] <maxmoore14> goddard: try .triggerHandler
[10:40:02] <goddard> ok
[10:40:40] <Antiga> also probably need .live
[10:41:56] <goddard> maxmoore14, that worked just not on page load
[10:41:57] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:42:35] <goddard> m
[10:43:14] <kamo> What cow?
[10:47:43] <kamo> Does anyone have a good reference for jquery and iframes?
[10:48:38] <goddard> kamo, the internet
[10:48:48] <goddard> i heard its really good :D
[10:49:57] <bahamas> goddard: are you using .on() to bind to the event?
[10:50:10] <goddard> no
[10:50:26] <goddard> never used that before
[10:51:32] <bahamas> goddard: .live() is its older equivalent, which has been deprecated in newer versions
[10:53:03] <kamo> @goddard yeah Internets is ok but not the best when I am looking for something to read when I am on the road
[11:04:08] <henn1nk> jquery masoonry: does someone know what is wrong if the containers are just floated?
[11:07:00] <pallet> hi all
[11:07:46] <Shubham> Hi guys i need some help in wrappng textarea around image
[11:08:29] <pallet> I've got a tabbed box with the following code in the function $(this).addClass("active"); how can I get any information out of "this" ie I need to know what tab is now active
[11:08:37] <djQuery> Shubham, dont think it can be done.
[11:08:55] <Shubham> @djquery but it is done in a site can i post a link ?
[11:09:10] <djQuery> sure
[11:09:35] <Shubham> http://www.someecards.com/usercards/create this is the link actually it's very very imp. i got a wrong proejct in my hand
[11:10:02] <Shubham> in this site when you check a image it will wrap text aroung it
[11:10:08] <Shubham> around*
[11:10:18] <djQuery> pallet, are you trying to remove active from the other tabs?   $(this).addClass('active').siblings('active').removeClass('active')'
[11:11:51] <JohnB12> I have a site I built. The background image is fullwidth, auto height and fluid with the browser. I want to change it from a static image to a couple of images that'll fade into one another. I'm not sure where to start. http://interactivitymarketing.com/~dev/mlodge/
[11:11:54] <pallet> djQuery, no that's ok and working, but what I'm not sure is I need to understand in    $("ul.tabs li").click(function() { for example, which one of the tab ids are actually being clicked
[11:11:58] <henn1nk> http://3hsu.localtunnel.com/ads/ ... jquery masonry seams not working right, any idea why?
[11:12:24] <djQuery> pallet, you know ui.tabs has an even for when a tab is clicked
[11:13:19] <pallet> djQuery, can I PM for a moment ?
[11:13:32] <djQuery> Shubham, go inspect the element, the text are is just over a div, and the transparency is set to show the divs background image behind it
[11:13:36] <djQuery> pallet, no
[11:13:50] <pallet> ah, sorry
[11:13:56] <pallet> ignore that then ;)
[11:14:04] <pallet> djQuery, http://pastebin.com/0J1JFfjh
[11:14:23] <djQuery> pallet, http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[11:14:42] <pallet> got it
[11:14:44] <pallet> thanks
[11:15:05] <Shubham> djQuery but it's wrapping i don't understand when i check their javascript they have a canvas and my client want's it  exactly like that and i am shocked that how the textarea can be wrapped around image
[11:15:16] <Shubham> checking inspect element..
[11:15:33] <djQuery> Shubham, I was able to type a long string and it over wrote the image
[11:15:50] <djQuery> it did not wrap around the image
[11:15:55] <maxmoore14> what is the best practice for passing a param to a page with JQM?
[11:16:10] <Shubham> @djquery no give a space like jquery is a cool language and it will wrap
[11:16:27] <Shubham> if you write full string it will not wrap
[11:18:02] <djQuery> Shubham, thats pretty cool don't understand how they are doing it but cool
[11:18:45] <Shubham> hehe i know it's cool but see they are using some type Canvas HTML5 and my client will just... :)
[11:23:55] <Gho5t> so we're not supposed to do browser detection and instead we should do feature detection. so if I determine that I don't want to use my custom radio buttons for IE, what's my course of action?
[11:24:34] <djQuery> Gho5t, why dont you want to do them?
[11:24:58] <djQuery> ?migrate@gho5t
[11:24:58] <bot-t> gho5t, jquery-migrate: Migrate older jQuery code to jQuery 1.9+ - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/tree/1.0.0#download
[11:25:10] <Gho5t> because I can't get them to function correctly
[11:25:14] <Gho5t> in ie 8 on win xp
[11:25:17] <Gho5t> for some reason
[11:25:44] <Gho5t> not sure what migrating to 1.9 has to do with anything
[11:25:55] <jedimind> being able to stlye somethign properly is not exactly consiered "feature"
[11:26:01] <jedimind> so feature detection doesnt really apply here
[11:26:11] <Gho5t> well it uses JS to style it
[11:26:15] <Gho5t> and for functionality
[11:26:23] <Gho5t> JS to add classes
[11:26:50] <jedimind> yeah, but its te CSS that's failing (well its interpretation in IE8)
[11:26:56] <Gho5t> no
[11:26:59] <jedimind> so its not like a feature is not being supported by IE8
[11:27:00] <Gho5t> the click handler isn't firing
[11:27:07] <Gho5t> for the label
[11:27:09] <Gho5t> or the input
[11:27:09] <jedimind> again, not feature, just shitty code then :)
[11:27:17] <jedimind> anyway all im trying to get at
[11:27:25] <jedimind> is that in THIS CASE (and thre are very few), i would just browser sniff
[11:27:37] <Gho5t> yeah cause it's so hard to write $('.custom-radio input').click()
[11:27:56] <Gho5t> ok
[11:28:08] <Gho5t> so there are use cases
[11:28:11] <Gho5t> is my point
[11:28:19] <Gho5t> but they removed $.browser
[11:28:33] <Gho5t> so we have to write our own
[11:29:49] <dcherman2> Gho5t: they had good reason to do so - it's bad practice.  can you make a jsfiddle of your bug, and can it be reproduced in IE8 mode in IE9/Win7 ( don't have WinXP )
[11:30:07] <Gho5t> can't repro it on win 7
[11:30:12] <Gho5t> it's a fun one
[11:30:15] <Gho5t> only xp on 8
[11:30:28] <dcherman2> can you describe what's happening?
[11:33:27] <Gho5t> my radiobuttons are wrapped in <div class="custom-radio">. They all have labels. The input is set to position: absolute; left: -99999px; The label background is the faux radio button. When the label is clicked it selects the radio. For some reason in my popup the radios won't work in IE 8. It's not an issue of reinitializing them. I click on the label and nothing happens. If i remove "left:...
[11:33:28] <Gho5t> ...-99999px;" I can click on the input and the updated style is applied
[11:34:27] <dcherman2> so write a test that reproduces those conditions and trigger a click event like you're doing, then you have an assertion of whether or not that bug exists in your browser, no?
[11:35:43] <Gho5t> I can trigger the click in the console
[11:35:49] <Gho5t> well actually the url bar
[11:35:55] <Gho5t> since IE 8 doesn't have a fn console
[11:36:02] <Gho5t> it works fine that way
[11:36:09] <Gho5t> maybe it is a stupid css issue
[11:36:18] <Gho5t> with the popup being positioned absolutely
[11:36:23] <Gho5t> messing up something
[11:36:26] <digitrig> can anyone recommend a quick/lean search query autocomplete (with ajax capability)?
[11:38:06] <digitrig> ?
[11:39:53] <Sweeetie> is the mobile framework chat here?
[11:40:16] <djQuery> yeppers
[11:41:26] <Sweeetie> anyone who actualy deved the mobile llib
[11:41:40] <Sweeetie> coz u fools fkd up on all the overlays
[11:41:41] <bahamas> digitrig: there is something in jqueryui
[11:41:42] <Sweeetie> and popups
[11:41:48] <Sweeetie> scroll the screen lol
[11:41:53] <djQuery> Gho5t, think u can install the dev tools there
[11:42:18] <Gho5t> I have them
[11:42:26] <Gho5t> yeah there is a console in the script pane
[11:42:28] <Gho5t> my bad
[11:42:42] <bahamas> digitrig: you implement the ajax part yourself, but it shouldn't be too hard
[11:45:14] <digitrig> bahams, I will check it out, thanks...
[11:46:50] <boytoy> What's the best way of checking whether the user is connecting from mobile or desktop inside my jQuery application.js file? The jQuery script at http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/?

[11:47:09] <spobat> *g*
[11:48:14] <johnkpaul> boytoy: for what purpose are you checking if it's mobile or desktop?
[11:48:46] <spobat> to exploit users
[11:50:47] <bahamas> hmm, isn't this kind of check better done in the backend?
[11:51:47] <jedimind> exploit users?

[12:02:47] <djQuery> Sweeetie, I know android has one
[12:03:02] <Sweeetie> android is pooopy
[12:03:10] <Sweeetie> kaka
[12:03:28] <NoiseEee> so by mobile you meant
[12:03:38] <NoiseEee> not the #1 mobile OS
[12:03:39] <NoiseEee> gotcha
[12:03:48] <Sweeetie> hahaha dun make me laf
[12:03:56] <Sweeetie> like the gaico lizard
[12:04:19] <Sweeetie> unless u mean #1 buggy OS
[12:05:02] <bahamas> Sweeetie: go somewhere else and annoy people
[12:06:48] <Sweeetie> thats bullshit
[12:07:12] <Sweeetie> i asked a valid question
[12:07:18] <jedimind> no you didn't
[12:07:23] <jedimind> it didn't even include valid english
[12:12:45] <Trudko> what is selector if I want to find out if option in select by text, not my value
[12:12:53] <pmercado> wich is the reason for plus sign here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js line 401 ........ ?
[12:13:02] <NoiseEee> check out :contains Trudko
[12:13:23] <NoiseEee> sorry .contains() http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[12:13:49] <NoiseEee> my bad twice; :contains.  http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ @ Trudko
[12:17:18] <jost> pmercado, I don't know for sure, but probably its there for type casting. val is a string, that needs to be casted to a number.
[12:20:16] <Tixz> pmercado, jost: That's defineatly a typecast to Number
[12:21:57] <Tixz> I guess the Globalize.parseFloat removes common number formatting characters before casting to base 10 (our normal decimal system)
[12:24:46] <boytoy> johnkpaul: hello
[12:25:47] <boytoy> johnkpaul: i want to check to see whether the user is desktop or mobile so that i can enable/disable animation for jquery masonry
[12:26:02] <boytoy> trying to do a simple seamless image setup like http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/
[12:27:49] <Brodingo> boytoy you can disable global animation with $.fx.off
[12:28:15] <djQuery> boytoy, if(typeof window.orientation !== 'undefined){}
[12:28:45] <djQuery> boytoy, havent seen a desktop browser yet that supports window.orientation
[12:30:19] <djQuery> boytoy, opps chrome supports it  http://caniuse.com/#search=orientation
[12:30:39] <Brodingo> i would think ie10 does with that surface thing
[12:30:50] <djQuery> Brodingo, noppers
[12:31:04] <boytoy> hmmm
[12:31:16] <boytoy> so no need for http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ etc.?
[12:32:00] <djQuery> boytoy, well unless they have installed chrome on thier phone
[12:32:09] <djQuery> or on thier desktop
[12:32:30] <Brodingo> boytoy are you doing this for performance reasons?
[12:33:41] <boytoy> It's the $("#test").slideToggle(); and jQuery Isotope's animationEngine: "jquery" at http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ that crashes on my Android browser
[12:34:11] <boytoy> I was hoping to find an easy way to go like "if mobile, use $("#test").show() and animationEngine: "css" instead
[12:34:28] <knucklevertz> Greetings. Jquery question: what's the fastest way to check if a dom element is in another element
[12:34:49] <Gho5t> size() or length
[12:35:00] <Brodingo> length
[12:35:48] <boytoy> so i should use $.fx.off together with if(typeof window.orientation !== 'undefined){}?
[12:35:53] <Gho5t> what's the deal with size() anyways...the docs say to use it but it seems like no one does
[12:36:01] <bahamas> knucklevertz: why do you want to know? there might be a better way
[12:36:42] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Hi All, I know there's something wrong with my syntax, but I'm not sure what it is. Why doesn't #input1 reflect the value of #input2 times 4? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4773138
[12:37:00] <djQuery> knucklevertz,    if ($('#domElement').closest('whateverselectror').length){}
[12:37:28] <djQuery> knucklevertz, or you might try see ?parents
[12:37:29] <bot-t> knucklevertz, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[12:37:38] <pmercado> Tixz: but how, what if window.Globalize do not exist?
[12:37:44] <ajpiano> knucklevertz: the fastest way is jQuery.contains
[12:37:50] <Gho5t> djQuery: is that really that more performant
[12:37:51] <knucklevertz> bahamas: I basically want to check if the current element that needs to be appended, is already in that div. I could just always call append, but if there are other elements, it'll just cause a redraw by adding it again likely. my guess is compare its parent
[12:38:01] <knucklevertz> oh contains, thanks!!
[12:38:07] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains @ knucklevertz
[12:38:08] <bot-t> knucklevertz, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[12:38:13] <ajpiano> takes two DOM elem references
[12:38:15] <pmercado> finally, sentence will be something like var = +var; when var is a string
[12:38:28] <knucklevertz> cool. thanks
[12:38:50] <Tixz> pmercado: Check line 11 - 14 of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[12:39:06] <Tixz> pmercado: It's got dependencies, and I bet that core contains Globalize
[12:40:30] <knucklevertz> how do I ask questions that waste peoples time because they have to read through the entire question before they get to the question mark?
[12:41:27] <bahamas> knucklevertz: can you tell me what these elements represent? maybe there's a different solution, that you shouldn't need to check at all
[12:41:59] <Jim__> I am new to jquery and am trying to keep my code as clean as possible.  Can I define the parameters of an $.ajax function using json?
[12:42:12] <pmercado> but seems is a javascript syntaxis issue
[12:42:37] <knucklevertz> bahamans: I appreciate your expertise, the contains seems like the easiest, i just have an element, and want to see if it's currently in another, if not, append it. so what i did was if (!parent.contains(element)){ element.appendTo(parent) } ...unless you have a faster way
[12:42:55] <Gho5t> take it easy bahamas
[12:45:09] <Brodingo> Jim__ you mean an object literal?
[12:45:27] <codepython777> whats a good replacement for jquery-jeditable?
[12:46:03] <Brodingo> knucklevertz you have to check contains().length
[12:46:21] <Brodingo> .contains() is a jquery method that will always return true
[12:46:47] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Can anyone tell me why #input1 doesn't reflect the value of #input2 times 4? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4773138
[12:47:13] <Gho5t> Brodingo: that is incorrect
[12:47:28] <Gho5t> it is a boolean
[12:47:45] <Brodingo> oh I'm sorry you're right
[12:47:49] <Brodingo> i was thinking closest
[12:47:54] <Brodingo> my bad yo
[12:47:55] <Jim__> could be....I am pretty new to anything javascript.  I have many jquery grids, listboxes, etc.  I am wanting to create some functions that I can pull the parameters from a database to define or something similar.  I just want to have one function for a grid, one for a list box, etc.  is object literal what I need to look into?
[12:48:18] <bahamas> Gho5t: what do you mean?
[12:48:22] <Sweeetie> im jquery mobiling
[12:48:23] <Sweeetie> :D
[12:48:31] <Sweeetie> on the move boiz
[12:48:44] <knucklevertz> i select a div with jquery, and it doesn't have the function contains
[12:48:58] <Gho5t> it's a utility function
[12:49:06] <Gho5t> $.contains(dom element, dom element)
[12:49:10] <Gho5t> read the docs
[12:49:18] <knucklevertz> thx
[12:49:25] <bahamas> m0nk_gr3g0r: what do you get?
[12:49:36] <m0nk_gr3g0r> bahamas: i get nothing
[12:50:20] <m0nk_gr3g0r> bahamas: #input1 stays blank
[12:50:53] <Sweeetie> how do i center h1
[12:50:56] <Sweeetie> in mobile
[12:51:36] <Gho5t> via css
[12:51:38] <Gho5t> like anything else
[12:51:51] <Jim__> brodingo....looks like that is what I am after.  Reading more about it now.  Thanks
[12:51:57] <Brodingo> cheers
[12:52:02] <bahamas> m0nk_gr3g0r: can you show more code?
[12:52:04] <Sweeetie> Gho5t: no
[12:52:07] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r your syntax isn't quite right
[12:52:11] <Sweeetie> thers gota be a data tag
[12:52:22] <Gho5t> a data tag to center an h1?
[12:52:25] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: i know, but i'm not sure what needs to change
[12:52:33] <Gho5t> maybe there's a color tag too
[12:52:46] <mdedetrich> is there a version of find which only finds a single node (instead of every node in the sibling)
[12:52:46] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r well if you're using a function it needs to return the value
[12:52:49] <m0nk_gr3g0r> bahamas: that's all the code that's affecting this piece
[12:53:00] <Sweeetie> sorry if u r idiot
[12:53:05] <Sweeetie> maybe others know
[12:53:20] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r return $('#input2').val() * 4;
[12:53:22] <Gho5t> me too
[12:53:37] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: ok… trying that - thank you
[12:53:45] <Brodingo> or really just
[12:54:02] <Brodingo> $('#input1').val($('#input2').val() * 4);
[12:56:14] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... $('input[data-max!=""]') would you guys expect this to grab elements that don't have a data-max attribute?
[12:57:04] <Gho5t> no
[12:57:20] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: neither of those worked
[12:57:33] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Not at all..
[12:57:50] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Oddly enough it does. I'd expect it to grab all elements that have a data-max that's not empty.
[12:57:53] <Brodingo> BillCriswell $("input:not([data-max])")
[12:57:54] <BillCriswell> Setting up a test thingie.
[12:57:54] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I'd expect input:not([data-max])
[12:58:13] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r post some more code or something
[12:58:58] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: the only other related code is $(document).ready(function() { at the beginning and the closing tag
[12:59:40] <Gho5t> BillCriswell: yeah actually...according to the docs that is a way to check
[12:59:59] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[13:00:14] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhh.
[13:02:18] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r $('#two').val($('#one').val() * 4); works for me
[13:03:07] <djQuery> how can I cause jquery mobile to navigate to a certain page. http://jsbin.com/abufew/3/edit
[13:03:35] <djQuery> onload I check to see if a setting has been saved to local storage and if it is not I need to direct them to the settings page
[13:06:06] <shoky> djQuery: $.mobile.changePage('#settings')  seems to work
[13:06:21] <djQuery> shoky, thanks
[13:12:18] <andres_d> $('.id_client').next().val(ui.item.id); will get the next element after id.client?
[13:12:29] <codepython777> I want to open up a panel on the left side of the html for notifications. How can I do this?
[13:12:48] <Brodingo> andres_d the next sibling of .id_client
[13:13:56] <andres_d> umm
[13:16:23] <Gho5t> yes
[13:16:31] <Gho5t> if it's a sibling
[13:17:48] <fgh`> hi
[13:18:00] <fgh`> if i have a file called main.js
[13:18:10] <fgh`> can i let main.js load other libary's
[13:18:13] <fgh`> like jquery
[13:19:28] <andres_d> Gho5t:  how do i know if its a sibling?
[13:19:40] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3773195/how-do-i-check-for-empty-attr-in-jquery wonder if it was true at some point.
[13:19:42] <Gho5t> does it belong to the same parent
[13:20:09] <BillCriswell> Nevermind. Was confused for a second.
[13:20:15] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: I had to do: $('#input1').change(
[13:20:15] <m0nk_gr3g0r>                 function(){
[13:20:16] <m0nk_gr3g0r>                   $('#input2').val( ($('#input1').val() * 4) );
[13:20:17] <m0nk_gr3g0r>             });
[13:20:28] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: thanks for all your help
[13:20:36] <Brodingo> no prob m0nk_gr3g0r  cheers
[13:20:41] <m0nk_gr3g0r> cheers
[13:24:30] <scar> is there a way to check for GET vars via js or jquery?
[13:24:53] <scar> just yes or no lol
[13:24:58] <Gho5t> no
[13:24:58] <scar> :D
[13:25:14] <Gho5t> i hope you'll allow this
[13:25:15] <scar> Crazy JS can't grab the URL that'
[13:25:18] <Gho5t> but you could use ajax
[13:25:25] <scar> wait, me?
[13:25:35] <scar> how can i use ajax?
[13:25:50] <Gho5t> maybe you could parse the current url
[13:25:50] <scar> maybe i can jusst have the URL given inside a var
[13:26:09] <Gho5t> yeah nvm
[13:26:13] <Gho5t> just parse the current url
[13:26:25] <scar> Well, maybe I should ask: Can I access the FULL, current URL with js/jquery?
[13:26:43] <scar> ok cool
[13:26:47] <Gho5t>  window.location.href
[13:28:28] <andres_d> Gho5t:  if u can take a look thanks http://jsfiddle.net/W9EUQ/3/
[13:36:47] <andres_d> My goooodd
[13:37:09] <andres_d> Gho5t:  it was due to the jquery version
[13:41:13] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to create a plugin https://gist.github.com/gogogarrett/3ae6bbc64545de8fd47f    but I want to be able to take an array of selectors similar to $.each( [], func(){});
[13:41:18] <GoGoGarrett> Any idea how to go about that?
[13:41:52] <narkeeso> I'm passing dataType html to an event handler, it seems elements retrieved this way do not have any width/height attributes since, how do i pass the object so it's more like a jquery object and not plain text
[13:42:25] <narkeeso> sorry, i'm using .ajax for this
[13:42:42] <Gho5t> you wrap it
[13:42:44] <Gho5t> in jquery
[13:43:28] <narkeeso> Gho5t: even after doing that, the element doesn't possess any width/height properties
[13:43:52] <Gho5t> what do you mean
[13:43:54] <MarcGuay> infinite scroll, when I click on "load more" it browses to that page.  Any ideas?
[13:43:57] <Gho5t> it's returning undefined?
[13:44:01] <narkeeso> returning 0
[13:44:31] <agib> does anyone know if there's a way to unset a $(document).ajaxSend handler?
[13:44:38] <Gho5t> The element must be present in the DOM in order for the width to be calculated
[13:45:08] <Gho5t> narkeeso: it's computed. Maybe try .css('width')
[13:46:23] <djQuery> to fake getting the width add it to the dom but set the left to -99999999999999999
[13:46:40] <djQuery> then check the width
[13:46:43] <narkeeso> Gho5t: that worked wonderfully
[13:47:55] <narkeeso> Gho5t: doesn't doing something like html.append() add the elements to the dom?
[13:48:34] <narkeeso> oh i know what the issue is
[13:48:44] <narkeeso> Gho5t: thanks a lot
[13:48:50] <Gho5t> sure
[14:06:44] <skypce> hello guys
[14:06:47] <skypce> can you help me please
[14:06:57] <skypce> i want change the background color of a code :http://pastebin.com/wN6Q5TVP
[14:07:05] <skypce> the background color of euro
[14:07:11] <skypce> and value
[14:15:14] <Mottie>  skypce: can you set up a demo
[14:15:25] <skypce> ok
[14:16:52] <skypce> Mottie: http://jsfiddle.net/hR5Cj/
[14:16:57] <skypce> it is from jquery ui library
[14:17:36] <skypce> i want add background color and other properties to euro sign
[14:19:13] <Mottie> skypce: fyi, when someone asks for a demo, they usually want you to include HTML, javascript and css... I'll go ahead and add that, but I need to know is #amount an input?
[14:19:55] <Mottie> skypce: actually it might be better to make it a span or div
[14:20:57] <skypce> Motiie, now check http://jsfiddle.net/hR5Cj/1/
[14:24:24] <Mottie> skypce: is that what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/hR5Cj/2/
[14:24:45] <boytoy> At http://bit.ly/VR7Lt7 -- slideToggle() and Isotope's animationEngine: "jquery" crashes my Android browser. What's the best way to check if the user is on mobile so I can then do show() and animationEngine: "css" instead? http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/?
[14:25:32] <skypce> Mottie: i want add background color to Euro sign
[14:25:45] <Mottie> skypce: just the euro sign?
[14:26:05] <skypce> and color:white
[14:26:07] <skypce> to letter
[14:26:18] <skypce> but only in euro sign and value
[14:26:22] <skypce> not in all input
[14:26:36] <skypce> only in start eugo sign and end euro sign
[14:27:56] <skypce> Mottie: only background in start of euro sign and value and end of euro sign value, and a empty white space between both
[14:31:40] <Mottie> skypce: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/hR5Cj/3/
[14:32:19] <Mottie> skypce: I ended up switching it to a <pre> because of all the spacing you wanted. It would be better to just add two elements and space them with css though
[14:34:03] <shoelessone> Is there a good way of iterating over an object and going in the alphabetical order of the "keys" in that object?
[14:34:22] <shoelessone> (writing a quick example)
[14:34:29] <skypce> very thank you Mottie
[14:34:40] <Mottie> skypce: wait

[14:35:06] <skypce> ok :D
[14:39:41] <Mottie> stupid internet... one more sec
[14:39:51] <Sweeetie> ay

[14:44:33] <skypce> if some day you need convert basic html to drupal or psd i can help you :D
[14:44:38] <ozette> shoelessone, maybe try a for .. in loop on that object, push each key on an array and .sort() this array?
[14:45:05] <Mottie> skypce: hehe thanks :P

[15:23:13] <kamoricks> I'm calling $('#select_date').datepicker('show'). It doesn't show a datepicker. Why not?
[15:23:33] <kamoricks> It also doesn't give any sort of error.
[15:24:03] <shoky> kamoricks: did you initialize it with .datepicker() or .datepicker({..options...})
[15:25:50] <Tunner> I'm using scrollTop(); to determine the scroll of elements, but it always shows 0
[15:25:58] <CannabisToke> why hasn't this irc link to jsfiddle been updated with a better site like cssdeck?
[15:26:20] <kamoricks> shoky: Yes. (And if I didn't, shouldn't that cause an error or return something else?) $('#select_date').datepicker().datepicker('show'); also doesn't show a datepicker.
[15:26:38] <shoky> kamoricks: welp, fiddle it
[15:27:43] <shoky> kamoricks: cause it works for me
[15:28:03] <kamoricks> shoky: It works on one of my pages. It does not work on another one of my pages.
[15:28:38] <shoky> kamoricks: ok..
[15:30:20] <kamoricks> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ZEFsD/ . No datepicker.
[15:31:13] <shoky> kamoricks:  #select_date is a button
[15:31:33] <kamoricks> shoky: Yes.
[15:32:30] <shoky> kamoricks: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[15:33:56] <kamoricks> shoky: There's nothing on that page that says it can't be a button, and the presence of a 'showOn' option in the API suggests that a button is perfectly valid. In fact, the other page it works on also uses a button.
[15:34:16] <kamoricks> shoky: No, it uses a hidden form field that fakes that it's a button. Thanks.
[15:35:06] <shoky> "The datepicker is tied to a standard form input field"  maybe it's not explicit enough, but they don't mean a button by that
[15:35:32] <shoky> but with jquery-ui, the way to go is to follow the examples
[15:37:38] <CannabisToke> I can't believe I can't find this but I've been looking for an hour now. How do you get the element of something being dragged regardless of whether or not its being dropped?

[15:42:15] <CannabisToke> ok, founnd it under event.scrElement.Attributes... isn't there a way to just get the element ie <div>blah</div>
[15:42:58] <CannabisToke> sorry, I'm learning =/
[15:43:57] <shoky> CannabisToke:  ui.helper
[15:44:12] <CannabisToke> thank you man
[16:04:12] <CannabisToke> why does a function inside drop fire before anything has been dropped?

[16:06:28] <Foxhoundz> coldhead: wha..what's this?
[16:07:05] <coldhead> aj and mr murphey telling you how to do conference talk proposals
[16:11:23] <StephenS> Hello I use this http://jsfiddle.net/hGTPp/ howeever when I add new element it does not work, why?
[16:12:15] <Tixz> StephenS: What do you mean by "new element"?
[16:12:23] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/hGTPp/199/
[16:12:34] <Tixz> Arr
[16:12:45] <Tixz> It's because id has to be unique
[16:13:10] <Tixz> Give me 2 min and I'll make an example from your code
[16:13:14] <StephenS> Tixz, yes but how I am going to change ID every ..
[16:13:29] <StephenS> I mean I cannot make 100 jquery scripts
[16:13:35] <StephenS> for every display :(
[16:13:40] <StephenS> ok
[16:14:34] <Foxhoundz> Use a class instead of an ID
[16:17:07] <Tixz> StephenS: Check this code: http://jsfiddle.net/Zw7j9/ You did a couple of things wrong, and I also gave the different elements more meaningful classes and removed some redundant markup
[16:18:00] <Tixz> StephenS: This one is better with styling: http://jsfiddle.net/N3zbB/
[16:19:26] <Tixz> StephenS: You use the id attribute when you have something to uniquely identify. If you want to classify something (as in share common styles/functionality/properties) you use the class attribute
[16:19:38] <StephenS> ah ok thanks
[16:19:39] <StephenS> lemme check
[16:19:49] <Foxhoundz> Even more better with styling! http://jsfiddle.net/xBUVX/
[16:20:21] * Foxhoundz crawls back under his rock
[16:20:22] <Tixz> Foxhoundz: Well, doesn't really add anything to the UX
[16:20:31] <Tixz> :p
[16:20:49] <Foxhoundz> Tixz:  I made an awesome menu out of it in chrome dev tools
[16:20:54] <Foxhoundz> but forgot to paste the CSS when forking
[16:20:56] <Foxhoundz> oh well
[16:21:09] <Tixz> I tip my hat for you sir
[16:21:40] <Foxhoundz> ok
[16:27:38] <rup3rt> hi in jquery1.9 $.browser is removed.. so how do i get to check if the browser is IE? previously i just do $.browser.msie
[16:28:42] <systemfault> Why do you need to check that?
[16:28:53] <systemfault> There's a reason why it was removed..
[16:29:21] <CannabisToke> http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/wprqxwe2/0 - could someone collab with me on this? I don't think it will be as simple as it should be
[16:29:49] <StephenS> Foxhoundz, no need for stylying
[16:29:55] <StephenS> I use it for something third...
[16:29:59] <StephenS> anyway its working now :)
[16:30:09] <Foxhoundz> StephenS: I was just messing around with it
[16:30:17] <StephenS> k
[16:33:01] <StephenS> Tixz, now when I have that url displayed, how can I call ajax url and remove something from db?
[16:33:11] <StephenS> I need unique identifier for that?
[16:34:12] <jqlearner> hey, can anyone explain to a noob what the difference between decodeURIComponent() and decodeURI() is?
[16:34:14] <Tixz> Yeah, but you'd probably save that database id in another way, like a <input type="hidden" /> or something like that :)
[16:34:42] <Tixz> jqlearner: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/747641/what-is-the-difference-between-decodeuricomponent-and-decodeuri
[16:34:47] <StephenS> Tixz, well what do you mean?
[16:35:00] <StephenS> If I have <a href="#">hidden button</a>
[16:35:14] <StephenS> Where should I add id to the url? Since its hidden button
[16:35:24] <Tixz> No no, hang on
[16:35:26] <StephenS> aka class="menu" according to your code
[16:36:07] <Tixz> You can save the database ID however you want. You could put it in the id attribute as it will be unique
[16:36:23] <Foxhoundz> StephenS: Have you considered trying out Backbone.js?
[16:36:25] <StephenS> yes
[16:36:32] <jqlearner> say i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/MSfgy/
[16:36:32] <StephenS> no
[16:36:40] <jqlearner> I need to develop a form that captures the e-mail address and return it as a query string parameter.
[16:36:42] <Tixz> Foxhoundz: Relax, he's only just grasping HTML
[16:36:46] <jqlearner> The query string parameter must display the @ symbol used in the email address.
[16:37:00] <StephenS> Tixz, ok I have <input type="hidden" value="10" name="remove">
[16:37:00] <jqlearner> should is use decodeURIComponent() and decodeURI() ?
[16:37:09] <Tixz> jqlearner: Then you use encodeURIComponent
[16:37:13] <Foxhoundz> oh
[16:37:18] <StephenS> So how would I call ajax url with that input field via url class="menu" ?
[16:37:55] <jqlearner> Tixj: the code i posted is incorrect then?
[16:38:12] <Tixz> StephenS: Don't you think it's going forward a bit rapidly, implementing ajax straight away? I'd first implement it using forms, and then sugar it with ajax after
[16:38:31] <StephenS> Tixz, I already have forms
[16:38:38] <StephenS> but now I want something sleeker :D
[16:39:05] <Tixz> jqlearner: decode is when it already has been encoded. Decode is what you'd likely do on the receiving end :)
[16:39:13] <StephenS> I want when on Close button clicked to remove it from db and to hide it from page, hiding I already know because its easy, but for button I have problems L:(
[16:39:23] <Tixz> StephenS: Then why don't you just do the form submission using ajax?
[16:39:33] <StephenS> how?
[16:40:01] <Tixz> You listen for the form's submit event and then intervene and do it by ajax instead
[16:40:12] <Tixz> then you can sprinkle all the javascript effects on top
[16:40:28] <StephenS> hmm
[16:40:38] <jqlearner> Tixj: so if i change the decodeURI in the code i posted to encodeURIcomponent, it will work?
[16:40:56] <StephenS> <a href="#" class="menu" id="remove">close/remove</a>
[16:40:56] <Tixz> Oh, I didn't see your code, can you post a link again?
[16:41:10] <jqlearner> http://jsfiddle.net/MSfgy/
[16:41:18] <Tixz> StephenS: No, id wouldn't be remove
[16:41:20] <StephenS> so I am just calling remove with jquery and storing hidden value in field and sending via ajax
[16:41:33] <StephenS> ugh
[16:42:30] <Tixz> jqlearner: What exactly are you trying to do?
[16:42:51] <Tixz> jqlearner: Your code doesn't really make sense to me, as in I don't see its purpose :)
[16:42:51] <StephenS> I can have >a href="remove.php?id=2" class="menu">remove</a>
[16:42:56] <jqlearner> i'm trying to create a form
[16:42:58] <Tixz> StephenS: Yep!
[16:43:05] <StephenS> and this will work, but person is seeing remove.php?id=... and I want him to see only #
[16:43:14] <StephenS> to does not know which ID nor with which language is removing..
[16:43:19] <jqlearner> as i said it needs to captures the e-mail address and return it as a query string parameter.
[16:43:33] <jqlearner> and the query string parameter must display the @ symbol used in the email address.
[16:43:50] <Tixz> StephenS: If you're doing it for security it won't help, you'll still have to make the request
[16:44:17] <StephenS> ok so lets say I do it this way
[16:44:20] <StephenS> remove.php?id=2
[16:44:26] <StephenS> remove.php will have ajax code right?
[16:44:32] <StephenS> and I just add .hide div from page?
[16:45:02] <Tixz> StephenS: Try and sketch it out in a fiddle. I have no idea what you mean
[16:45:34] <Tixz> jqlearner: Alright, you want to grab the email, and encode it so it can be used in a querystring?
[16:45:40] <jqlearner> yes
[16:45:56] <StephenS> erm for hiding I use $("p").hide();
[16:46:04] <StephenS> but p is not unique, so what should I use?
[16:46:10] <StephenS> some unique identifier id="2"
[16:46:12] <Tixz> But why do you want to encode it manually? jQuery encodes it for you if you're thinking of ajax, and the browser will do it for you if its form submission :)
[16:46:27] <Tixz> StephenS: Do the fiddle, then I'll help you
[16:46:48] <StephenS> Its little late in here 2 AM almost\
[16:46:54] <StephenS> and I have exam tomorror morning :(
[16:47:05] <zoned> $el.find("myClass")  selects a bunch of divs. of this "myClass" div list, i'd like to only select the ones that do not also have the "hidden" class. what does this selector look like?  $el.find("myClass > :not(hidden)")  still selects a bunch of "myClass" divs' children that don't have a hidden class
[16:47:16] <Tixz> StephenS: Then do this after your exam :)
[16:47:34] <Tixz> Go to bed, it's better to be refreshed for an exam than code on this
[16:47:47] <Tixz> jqlearner: But why do you want to encode it manually? jQuery encodes it for you if you're thinking of ajax, and the browser will do it for you if its form submission :)
[16:48:02] <jqlearner> so this code is unnecessary?
[16:48:23] <Tixz> jqlearner: Yes pretty much :)
[16:48:36] <jqlearner> but will it work?
[16:48:48] <Tixz> Yes, of course it will
[16:48:49] <shoky> zoned:  .find("myClass:not(.hidden)")
[16:49:21] <shoky> er ".myClass..
[16:49:30] <StephenS> Tixz, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/4cP8h/
[16:49:40] <StephenS> for every div I have that button which needs to close that div  and so on..
[16:49:46] <jqlearner> so i change the decodeURI in my code to encodeURIComponent and it will work, but the code is unnecessary?
[16:49:54] <zoned> ha i was missing the . before hidden
[16:50:00] <zoned> no wonder
[16:50:24] <Tixz> jqlearner: Yes
[16:50:55] <jqlearner> Tixz: much thanks
[16:51:18] <Tixz> jqlearner: No worries. Ask anytime
[16:51:56] <jqlearner> and by the way, what difference would it have been if i used encodeURI instead?
[16:52:08] <StephenS> maybe I need to use JSON interaction between js and php with jquery ?
[16:52:47] <Tixz> StephenS: I think you need to brush up on your HTML :) But here's how I'd do it: http://jsfiddle.net/ZSybm/
[16:53:07] <Tixz> This way it also works if the user has js disabled, or you have a fatal bug in your js
[16:53:21] <StephenS> uhm your code removes everything
[16:53:28] <StephenS> I need to remove only div with id=1 lets say..
[16:54:46] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/ZSybm/4/
[16:54:54] <StephenS> see id's for every div, I need that to be hidden...
[16:56:22] <jqlearner>  Tixz: by the way, what difference would it have been if i used encodeURI instead in the code?
[16:57:00] <Tixz> jqlearner: encodeURI doesn't encode URI seperators such as @ : / and those kind of chars
[16:57:06] <Tixz> encodeURIComponent does
[16:57:27] <Tixz> because you're encoding a, you guessed it, an URI component
[16:57:54] <jqlearner> so for practical purposes, i'll have to use encodeURIComponent so that every thing gets encoded?
[16:58:18] <Tixz> StephenS: just change $(this).dispose() to $(this).remove();
[16:58:49] <StephenS> still removes everything
[16:58:52] <StephenS> on jsfiddle..
[17:00:31] <Tixz> jqlearner: Just your URI components. That means that if you want to transfer an email address then yes, but if you just want to encode say, < > then you use encodeURI
[17:01:02] <Tixz> jqlearner: Though I'd say that escape() is much more common
[17:01:26] <Tixz> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/ZSybm/13/
[17:01:43] <jqlearner> but encodeURIComponent will still work in all cases? (even for encoding just < >)
[17:01:50] <Tixz> Yep
[17:02:16] <jqlearner> thanks again!
[17:02:21] <StephenS> yeah but this random close divs :D
[17:02:47] <Tixz> jqlearner: No worries, I'm off to bed
[17:02:54] <Tixz> StephenS: No it doesn't: http://jsfiddle.net/ZSybm/14/
[17:04:12] <StephenS> Tixz, yes but on every linl click Ill get removed div.. :(
[17:04:23] <Tixz> Then just remove .parent()
[17:04:47] <Tixz> But I really think you should go to bed. I know I am... (We're in the same timezone)
[17:04:55] <jqlearner> Tixz: good night
[17:05:08] <StephenS> Well now is only button hiding nothing else :(
[17:05:36] <Tixz> StephenS: Yes, but I have no idea what you want
[17:05:49] <StephenS> to hide specific div
[17:06:13] <xenaxon> guys
[17:06:16] <StephenS> lets say every <div class="bla" id="2">bla close</div> <div ... id="3">close</div>
[17:06:20] <xenaxon> http://arborjs.org/
[17:06:25] <StephenS> so thos divs with text in it, hide.
[17:06:32] <xenaxon> can someone help me with implementing arbor.js ?
[17:06:56] <Tixz> StephenS: Yes, and that's exactly what it's doing now?
[17:07:10] <StephenS> not really
[17:07:18] <StephenS> its hiding only close button but not the content
[17:08:17] <Foxhoundz> xenaxon: the day people stop suffixing JS libraries with ".js" is the day I will the lottery.
[17:08:31] <Tixz> StephenS: That's why I had the .parent() in there
[17:08:47] <Tixz> Then it goes up from the clicked "a" to the parent "div" and removes that
[17:09:28] <StephenS> nope, it removes every href
[17:09:34] <xenaxon> foxhoundz: :)) do you know how to work with it?
[17:10:00] <Tixz> xenaxon: It seems very complicated to get started with. I'd recommend D3.js instead as a beginner
[17:10:04] <Foxhoundz> xenaxon: No. I never used this library in my life.
[17:10:18] <StephenS> Tixz, here http://jsfiddle.net/ZSybm/15/
[17:10:23] <Foxhoundz> And from the looks of it, I never will.
[17:10:32] <StephenS> I have on page menu, so if somene click login, it will remove everything lol :(
[17:10:35] <xenaxon> foxhoundz: I don't see any arbor
[17:10:38] <xenaxon> in D3
[17:10:51] <Tixz> StephenS: arr, it's because you have to be more specific in your remove links
[17:10:59] <Tixz> Like give them all a class of remove
[17:11:09] <StephenS> where to add that class?
[17:11:29] <StephenS> with .find() ?
[17:11:48] <Tixz> xenaxon: I thought you wanted to do a force directed graph layout?
[17:12:12] <Tixz> No, in your html
[17:12:21] <xenaxon> no, I want to do a force directed arboreschent sitemap
[17:12:49] <Tixz> Anyway StephenS, you're on your own now. I'm going to bed, and the first thing you should do tomorrow is go to W3School's html section and get a refresher
[17:13:11] <StephenS> :D
[17:13:14] <StephenS> Where are you from?
[17:13:30] <pachet> w3fools :[
[17:13:33] <Tixz> xenaxon: Is that fancy for tree layout?
[17:13:59] <xenaxon> yes
[17:14:09] <Tixz> pachet: It's not that bad for getting the basics down when you already have a general idea
[17:14:22] <xenaxon> Tixz: Actually I want it to be like a cluster
[17:14:23] <Tixz> xenaxon: They got that in D3 as well :)
[17:14:25] <xenaxon> which is extremely fancy
[17:15:00] <Tixz> xenaxon: http://bl.ocks.org/4063570 you control all styling with css, and you can do a vertical one as well
[17:15:26] <Tixz> StephenS: Denmark
[17:16:05] <xenaxon> Tixz: It's not what I'm trying to do
[17:16:22] <Tixz> xenaxon: Out of luck then
[17:18:10] <xenaxon> Tixz: can you check out arbor.js? Maybe you can figure out how to replicate the demo on the homepage
[17:18:18] <sirspazzolot> can I select something using only part of its selector? eg $('#privacy_group_*')
[17:18:32] <Tixz> xenaxon: Yeah, all the demos can be done with D3
[17:18:44] <Tixz> xenaxon: they're simply force directed graphs
[17:18:56] <xenaxon> nah, there is more to arbor
[17:18:59] <xenaxon> it's adaptive
[17:19:07] <Tixz> xenaxon: http://bl.ocks.org/4062045
[17:19:09] <xenaxon> that means it works on any resolution
[17:19:18] <xenaxon> Tixz: already checked it
[17:19:39] <Tixz> xenaxon: So can d3 be
[17:20:10] <xenaxon> can you set the width of the viewport in real time
[17:20:16] <xenaxon> and it will adapt?
[17:20:17] <Tixz> xenaxon: I'm just looking at the code in the sample project for arbor.js compared to the same diagram in d3.js and I'd go with d3 any day
[17:21:04] <xenaxon> can I display text in nodes?
[17:21:08] <Tixz> xenaxon: You can just have your svg's dimensions in a relative unit like % and it will
[17:21:09] <xenaxon> I mean, a title, or something
[17:21:23] <Tixz> xenaxon: You can do whatever you want. The sky is your limit
[17:21:28] <xenaxon> can't have it in relative units
[17:21:33] <xenaxon> ok
[17:21:35] <Tixz> xenaxon: http://bl.ocks.org/1377729
[17:21:35] <xenaxon> I'll check it
[17:21:44] <xenaxon> but short question, can I place any text in the edges?
[17:21:56] <Tixz> xenaxon: By relative I mean eg. width: 100%
[17:22:10] <Tixz> xenaxon: do a google search
[17:22:17] <xenaxon> yeah, I know. but the layout of my page makes it so that I can't really set a percent
[17:22:22] <Tixz> but you probably can
[17:22:27] <xenaxon> because the container width is set in javascript
[17:22:30] <xenaxon> and I have padding
[17:22:32] <xenaxon> on the sides
[17:22:36] <Tixz> xenaxon: then set it with javascript
[17:22:40] <xenaxon> oh, ok
[17:22:55] <xenaxon> and one more thing, if you know
[17:23:08] <xenaxon> sure, D3 is nice
[17:23:11] <xenaxon> but what's the license
[17:23:48] <Tixz> xenaxon: look it up yourself
[17:24:03] <xenaxon> ok
[17:24:09] <coldhead> https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/LICENSE
[17:24:22] <coldhead> it's an MIT variant by the looks of it
[17:40:07] <ner0x> If I have an array of Objects. How can I find the object with the attribute 'name' == 'sSearch' ?
[17:41:31] <coldhead> bye, bot-t1
[17:43:02] <coldhead> for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { if (arr[i].name === 'aSearch') break; }; var o = arr[i];
[17:51:10] <d4rklit3> hey
[17:51:31] <d4rklit3> is ther a way to get $(obj).css(left) without the "px"
[17:52:10] <coldhead> no, you have to use string manipulation to strip it out
[17:52:35] <coldhead> $(obh).css('left').replace(/px/, '') or somesuch
[17:56:17] <pachet> parseInt($('#foo').css('left'), 10)
[17:58:31] <coldhead> oh yeah!
[18:01:40] <flow_v> can anybody point me here.. how can i create dinamic hidden inputs here in order to catch the correct ui.item.id http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/

[19:06:23] <relipse> how do make the datepicker smaller, the calendar is massive (i tried doing font-size: 10px) but that only made the text smaller with massive round edges
[19:12:07] <RobW> relipse: it's your inherited css (probably a reset.css)
[19:16:03] <Entomo> !quote
[19:16:15] <Entomo> doh.  Sorry - wrong room
[19:16:52] <coldhead> <3
[19:22:25] <sirspazzolot> so I send a post request to a php script, and it pops up a dialog box asking me to confirm. is there a way to automatically confirm this?
[19:23:02] <sirspazzolot> is tampering with the response something that would be under my control?
[19:23:59] <sirspazzolot> or is there a jquery way to automatically click a button?
[19:26:30] <greg5green> you have a working example?
[19:28:19] <sirspazzolot> greg5green: sure. http://bpaste.net/show/76918/ greasemonkey script to remove fb friends en masse, as well as groups and liked pages. navigate to the groups page
[19:28:35] <sirspazzolot> actually the dialog pops up without the script so forget that noise haha
[19:28:45] <greg5green> yeah, sorry, im not trolling thru 154 lines of code
[19:29:12] <sirspazzolot> oh did you mean the code of the dialog? that's shorter, but messy one-line php
[19:29:17] <greg5green> but nm, since thats not the problem anyways
[19:29:17] <sirspazzolot> (not written by me_
[19:29:38] <greg5green> why would you have a dialog box driven by php?
[19:30:07] <greg5green> or at least, one line of php
[19:31:26] <sirspazzolot> greg5green: http://bpaste.net/show/cQ5aX94TM21EoiSlQ0Y1/ it's the response facebook sends when I send a post request to the "leave group" script, asking to confirm that I want to
[19:32:04] <kokoat> $('<div/>',{id:"foo"}).load(...)     what is that syntax in the selector?
[19:32:25] <greg5green> yeah, good luck on that sirspazzolot, because im going to sir-pass-a-on-that-a-lot
[19:32:34] <greg5green> sorry for the bad pun, but i dont have the patience for it :(
[19:32:46] <sirspazzolot> if nothing else, it'd be cool if I could just add a "norefresh" to that. is this something I can do (with jquery) or do I want to head over to #php?
[19:33:01] <greg5green> add a norefresh waht?
[19:33:04] <sirspazzolot> hahahah no problem, greg5green. I'm just super excited that I've even gotten this far haha
[19:33:26] <greg5green> it's about my bedtime, ya kno?
[19:33:34] <greg5green> easy problems are nice to solve before then :P
[19:33:35] <sirspazzolot> oh yeah when you manually click "confirm" the page refreshes which I don't want. it'd be better if it wouldn't refresh so it would just let you click through all the confirms manually
[19:33:59] <sirspazzolot> lol yeah, this is kind of over my head. first real programming project
[19:34:17] <greg5green> .preventDefault() is what you would normally want for that, but I'm 999.99999% sure that FB has already overwritten the default :P
[19:34:53] <sirspazzolot> cool, I'll keep that in mind. thanks!
[19:42:58] <RobW> anyone know why $(document).live("swipeleft", func) isn't working?
[19:45:53] <yeahyeahyeahs> hello
[19:46:01] <yeahyeahyeahs> can u help me with this one
[19:46:11] <yeahyeahyeahs> right now I have an array with keys
[19:46:19] <yeahyeahyeahs> I want to get rid of it
[19:47:24] <greg5green> myArrayName = [];
[19:47:54] <RobW> lol
[19:48:27] <greg5green> RobW, 1. .live is deprecated, 2. do you have something that sends the event swipeleft?
[19:48:51] <greg5green> i wonder if that was helpful
[19:48:53] <greg5green> lol
[19:49:06] <greg5green> my favorite thing is "helping" someone and them not responding
[19:49:07] <RobW> site is using an older version of jquery.. but thought it was supported
[19:49:29] <greg5green> it still is, just wanted to point it out :P

[19:49:59] <CannabisToke> sorry
[19:50:02] <greg5green> CannabisToke, lay off the cannabis before you paste shit
[19:50:03] * RobW slaps CannabisToke around a bit with a large trout
[19:50:03] <CannabisToke> I don't know whats going on
[19:50:16] <greg5green> lol
[19:50:29] <CannabisToke> very sorry about that!
[19:51:08] <greg5green> CannabisToke, I'm not inclined to answer your question because I'm going to leave in a minute or so, but if you want help, set up something on jsfiddle.net
[19:51:22] <kokoat> $('<div/>',{id:"foo"}).load(...)     what is that syntax in the selector?
[19:51:25] <greg5green> so that people can see what you are talking about and play around with it
[19:51:41] <CannabisToke> I do have a question though and I don't know what go passed in - http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/davv1rau/0 - How can I switch positions of the img when it is dragged onto the opposing image?
[19:51:56] <greg5green> oh good
[19:52:02] <greg5green> have that sort of thing setup already
[19:52:35] <greg5green> i revert to my, I'm sorry, but im leaving in a minute status
[19:52:43] <greg5green> i dont have experience with jquery-ui really
[19:52:47] <greg5green> so i can't even give you a tip
[19:53:12] <greg5green> RobW, have you tried setting that event listener on body?
[19:53:14] <CannabisToke> no problem =)
[19:53:16] <greg5green> or your container?
[19:54:10] <greg5green> window isnt always what you think it is, and frankly, I think its bad practice to put an eventlistener on it
[19:55:13] <greg5green> i doubt thats the problem for this specific issue tho
[19:55:33] <greg5green> youd have to do a fiddle as well for much more help
[19:55:59] <greg5green> sometimes abstracting it out to a jsfiddle solves the problem by itself without even having to post it here
[19:56:00] <greg5green> :D

[20:13:49] <DreamStiffler> which jquery is this?

[20:14:43] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:14:50] <DreamStiffler> coldhead: hi good looking. i was hoping it wasnt
[20:14:54] <coldhead> you can animate the width and the height toegher, or anything else you care about
[20:16:19] <DreamStiffler> any chance you already have a working example? coz ive been working from an existing script that was using a div and applying it to a ul li menu..for hours. but failed
[20:16:36] <kokoat> $('<div/>',{id:"foo"}).load(...)     what is that syntax in the selector?
[20:17:27] <coldhead> there's a demo down a few screens at http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:18:01] <coldhead> also all this nonsense http://viralpatel.net/blogs/understanding-jquery-animate-function/

[21:54:12] <csdco> DreamStiffler: Your'e missing quotes.
[21:54:35] <csdco> DreamStiffler: li.sub needs closing quotes. Also you're targetting all li.sub's not just those "under" the parent.
[21:54:38] <csdco> so...
[21:54:50] <csdco> $('li.sub', this).animate(...)
[21:55:40] <DreamStiffler> oh ok thanks..dang it cut and paste

[21:58:40] <fat>  I found a real simple upload file tutorial on the web: http://www.9lessons.info/2012/09/multiple-file-drag-and-drop-upload.html, however, it only accepts image files to upload. Is there any way that I can make it upload all files type instead of only just image files.
[22:00:36] <kris33> How should long, multi-paragraph HTML/text replacement be handled?
[22:00:50] <DreamStiffler> csdco: http://jsfiddle.net/8VTZ4/17/ this didnt quite work f
[22:01:20] <coldhead> very carefully
[22:01:39] <kris33> ;P
[22:03:33] <coldhead> fat: https://github.com/arunkumarsekar/Multiple_file_drag_and_drop_upload/blob/master/js/multiupload.js#L56
[22:03:34] <kris33> I mean, I could remove all the blank lines in the HTML and manually switch every " to ' , but that seems pretty weak and painful considering the replacement text is about 50 lines long.
[22:03:39] <coldhead> have that function always return true
[22:04:36] <coldhead> kris33: the easiest way is usaully to use a template engine
[22:04:45] <coldhead> like handlebars or the tmpl() function in underscore
[22:04:46] <fat> coldhead: ok let me try
[22:05:06] <coldhead> if you need to use multiline strings in your JS you could use Coffeescript which allows multiline strings
[22:05:20] <fat> coldhead: ok i see that line. what should i do
[22:08:29] <fat> coldhead: ?
[22:08:33] <kris33> coldhead: Thanks, I'll look into it.
[22:12:11] <naeluh> Hi can anyone tell what is breaking my colorbox plugin - its here - http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site4/ I am not seeing any errors and I am assuming its the zoomooz plugin because it worked before and now it doesn't I can answer any questions or show anything that might make it more clear thanks
[22:17:56] <newhere> i'm having some problems working with a json response, i keep getting "unexpected token :", google results all point to cross domain problem, which may be the case, just wondering if anyone had any insight
[22:19:21] <Cork> newhere: are you expecting json or jsonp?
[22:19:33] <newhere> its returning application/json
[22:19:49] <coldhead> fat: have it always return false
[22:19:57] <coldhead> inside that function
[22:19:58] <Cork> ya, and what is the script expecting to get?
[22:20:01] <coldhead> the very first line
[22:20:06] <Cork> newhere: ^
[22:20:09] <coldhead> return true;
[22:20:14] <newhere> i've tried crossDomain:"false"
[22:20:25] <coldhead> or return 1;
[22:20:27] <Cork> do you have a callback=? in the url?
[22:20:31] <coldhead> basically return something other than -1
[22:21:43] <newhere> i've tried a callback in the url with a simple function callback(data){console.log(data)} and get the unexpected token :
[22:21:44] <fat> coldhead: so i should replace "return arr.indexOf(format);" with "return.false"
[22:22:13] <Cork> newhere: thats not how it works
[22:22:23] <newhere> haha, ok
[22:22:36] <Cork> newhere: if you give ?callback=? in the rul, jquery expects to get a javascript file back
[22:22:52] <Cork> and that that file will run the function jquery sends, with the json as the argument
[22:23:03] <Cork> thats how jsonp works
[22:23:29] <coldhead> fat: return true; not return false;
[22:23:39] <coldhead> i would try that and see if it worked
[22:23:52] <coldhead> then i would try to understand why it works because it might be important
[22:24:08] <coldhead> then i would treat myself to a delicious terry's chocolate orange
[22:25:32] <fat> coldhead: multiUploader.prototype._validate = function(format){ 		var arr = this.config.support.split(","); 		return false
[22:25:38] <fat> coldhead: better?
[22:26:57] <coldhead> sure
[22:26:59] <coldhead> why not
[22:27:06] <coldhead> try it and see
[22:28:21] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[22:28:47] <fat> coldhead: nooo its not working!
[22:30:24] <coldhead> try return 1; instead
[22:32:32] <fat> coldhead: nope didn't work...can you please create it from your end. nothings working here...
[22:32:33] <fat> sigh
[22:33:13] <coldhead> yes why dont you got get yourself a drink while i do everything for you
[22:34:24] <fat> coldhead: i can't get a drink where i am yet. im trying my best too u know
[22:34:34] <fat> coldhead: the problem is at index.php line 11 i think
[22:35:24] <DreamStiffler> i really need help here : http://jsfiddle.net/8VTZ4/31/
[22:36:34] <Cork> DreamStiffler: you need to ask your question too
[22:37:33] <DreamStiffler> Cork: all i want to do is have an animate expand for my child ul when parent li hovered, and hide it when mouse leaves parent li.
[22:38:01] <coldhead> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/h7V9K/
[22:38:18] <coldhead> fat: this plugin looks pretty crappy
[22:38:38] <fat> coldhead: is there a drag and drop function?
[22:39:39] <coldhead> looks like it
[22:39:56] <Cork> DreamStiffler: your dom structure is invalid
[22:40:16] <Cork> DreamStiffler: div isn't a valid child to ul
[22:41:33] * tw2113 makes DreamStiffler's list dance
[22:42:37] * DreamStiffler list dances
[22:43:00] <DreamStiffler> im not sure how to say this. but im stuck
[22:43:13] <DreamStiffler> i tried using li
[22:43:44] <tw2113> divs can go inside of li's, but not ul's
[22:43:47] <DreamStiffler> but it wont dissapear unless i use the .hide .show like this one http://jsfiddle.net/LEp69/2/
[22:44:13] <DreamStiffler> but thats not the fx i wanted
[22:44:51] <tw2113> Cork was complaining about your markup, not your jQuery methods
[22:45:11] <Cork> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/8VTZ4/36/
[22:45:15] <DreamStiffler> i know and im explaining why i had a div there
[22:45:32] <DreamStiffler> i hope 36 is my lucky number
[22:45:52] <coldhead> we all hope that
[22:49:09] <tw2113> i hope for things regarding coldhead too
[22:50:47] <coldhead> please hope that my nose stops bleeding
[22:51:07] <coldhead> and her test results come back negative

[23:04:01] <H0bbyte> Hello. I've got a Problem.
[23:05:07] <H0bbyte> i need to use the jQuery .autocomplete but the source must be depending whether an checkbox is checked or not.
[23:05:11] <DreamStiffler> H0bbyte: dont everybody
[23:06:08] <H0bbyte> I tried to put the if-else statement in front of the .autocomplete function, but then it is only checked when the side is loading.
[23:06:17] * DreamStiffler is doing the chickin dance
[23:06:53] <djQuery> jquery mobile doesn't have a help icon?
[23:07:33] <H0bbyte> I need to check it every time, when the Text is changing, or something like this. How can i do that?
[23:09:30] <djQuery> H0bbyte,   var autoCsetting = {source: blah};
[23:10:31] <ezotrank> Good day. I found that method .live() is deprecated in jquery 1.9 what alternative method?
[23:10:37] <ezotrank> i should use
[23:10:50] <coldhead> ?on
[23:10:55] <coldhead> >: |
[23:11:07] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:11:13] <coldhead> on() is your modern live()
[23:11:19] <ezotrank> coldhead: ok, thx
[23:12:03] <djQuery> H0bbyte, just change the source of the autocomplete on change of the checkbox
[23:12:13] <djQuery> H0bbyte, see ?change
[23:12:36] <djQuery> H0bbyte, http://api.jquery.com/change/
[23:12:41] <djQuery> dang lazy bot
[23:12:51] <maxmoore14> can someone look at this for a sec... http://jsfiddle.net/AAvUc/2/
[23:13:11] <djQuery> maxmahem, 1 one thousand
[23:13:15] <H0bbyte> Oh. Ok. thx
[23:13:33] <coldhead> looks good to me, maxmoore14
[23:13:33] <maxmoore14> 2 problems, the buttons needs to be reformatted
[23:13:35] <coldhead> case closed
[23:13:35] <djQuery> maxmahem, what about it
[23:13:51] <maxmoore14> and the popup is slightly off center
[23:13:58] <maxmahem> indeed
[23:14:46] <maxmoore14> not sure how/where to get those done
[23:14:55] <djQuery> maxmoore14, is there a reason you arent just using the jquery mobile dialog?
[23:15:33] <maxmoore14> I'm happy to use dialog too. I tried with that first, but actually had more difficulty
[23:15:50] <djQuery> maxmoore14, http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html
[23:16:05] <maxmoore14> the issue I'm having is I'm trying to dynamically change the buttons & text, etc
[23:16:25] <maxmoore14> and I need to be able to change them as late as in the pageinit event
[23:17:02] <djQuery> maxmoore14, think you need to call .button on the buttons again
[23:17:27] <djQuery> maxmoore14, the buttons initialized with the size that they are because they had no text to start with
[23:17:47] <maxmoore14> right
[23:18:07] <maxmoore14> but I tried both .button() and. trigger('create')
[23:18:16] <maxmoore14> neither helped
[23:18:27] <maxmoore14> can you show me in the fiddle?
[23:18:34] <djQuery> maxmoore14, yeah just tried that myself didnt work
[23:19:00] <maxmoore14> djQuery: weird, right?
[23:21:06] <djQuery> maxmoore14, call destroy on them first
[23:21:17] <djQuery> maxmoore14, then set the props then call button?
[23:21:54] <djQuery> maxmoore14, .button('destroy').button()
[23:22:01] <djQuery> ??
[23:23:23] <djQuery> maxmoore14, wish .dialog work like it does jquery ui
[23:23:24] <maxmoore14> says they are not initialized...
[23:23:31] <maxmoore14> ME TOO
[23:23:41] <maxmoore14> I miss ui
[23:23:54] <maxmoore14> struggling with jqm
[23:24:53] <djQuery> maxmoore14, there is a refresh?
[23:24:53] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[23:25:01] <djQuery> have you tried that?
[23:25:08] <maxmoore14> nope, just on listview
[23:25:33] <maxmoore14> that would be perfect, but doesn't exist
[23:26:49] <newhere> anyone got a few minutes for a one on one via gotomeeting?  i'm  missing something while trying to work with a JSON web service
[23:28:42] <icdjohnsson> as asked in javascript without reply-maybe it's possible through jQuery--- is there a way to send a POST request without using Ajax? I do want the target site to load. The thing is that I would want to set the post data parameter myself.
[23:31:41] <AdamPDotty> thats the definition of AJAX, right?
[23:32:10] <AdamPDotty> you do not want to get from A to B, you just want to travel there ..
[23:37:11] <wagtag> icdjohnsson: you could create a form with the parameters you want to POST as hidden input types, set the form method to POST and then trigger a submit
[23:39:09] <icdjohnsson> wagtag: yes - but you'd really think there is another way without having to make a hidden form?
[23:40:04] <abjorn> that's the only way other than ajax
[23:40:48] <wagtag> icdjohnsson: Ajax. Couldn't you just reload target page after ajax success?
[23:40:55] <icdjohnsson> abjorn: how wierd.
[23:41:02] <icdjohnsson> wagtag: yes, perheps I could
[23:41:04] <abjorn> well, i mean, it's not that weird
[23:41:12] <abjorn> since that's not something you should typically need to do
[23:41:18] <abjorn> and if you do...well, a hidden form works just fine
[23:41:50] <Cork> ya, the hidden form is the way its normally done
[23:42:04] <Cork> with possibly a target="_new" to trigger a new tab
[23:42:06] <icdjohnsson> abjorn: wagtag thanks to both of you
[23:42:44] <abjorn> well, there is one other way...would required some back end code, though
[23:43:09] <abjorn> it's not advisable though
[23:43:10] <abjorn> :p
[23:43:33] <abjorn> if you code your backend to accept a get request with parameters that it then passes to whatever POST url
[23:43:36] <abjorn> and redirect syou
[23:43:38] <abjorn> *redirects you
[23:43:57] <abjorn> would work in a pinch but that defeats the point of POST
[23:44:05] <Cork> and you can't redirect to post
[23:44:12] <abjorn> that too
[23:44:13] <Cork> the browser will change the post to get :)
[23:44:37] <abjorn> you can output the result of whatever curl you did though, but I would guess in most cases that wouldn't really work
[23:44:52] <abjorn> depends on what the POST does, i guess
[23:44:56] <Cork> and it would looks like all changes came from your own server
[23:44:59] <Cork> instead from the user
[23:45:10] <abjorn> yeah, like I said, not advisable
[23:45:11] <abjorn> :p
[23:45:20] <Cork> and that would suck a bit if you want to track down how did what
[23:46:02] <abjorn> unfortunately we have some code at work that works a bit like that >.> except consuming APIs rather than displaying a page
[23:46:13] <abjorn> because apparently our system architects are afraid of a little reverse proxy
[23:46:15] <tw2113> you catch all that icdjohnsson ?
[23:46:18] <abjorn> pft
[23:46:31] <heyho_> hy all, anyone knows a lighbox with Image Toggle inside the Lightbox? Link this: http://y30i.img-up.net/needed37f1.jpg
[23:46:59] <tw2113> lightbox inception sucks ass
[23:47:06] <tw2113> just a warning from experience
[23:47:15] <abjorn> ^
[23:47:49] <heyho_> ??
[23:48:02] <tw2113> lightbox from inside a lightbox?
[23:48:24] <heyho_> no the images should change..
[23:48:48] <tw2113> so you want a slider contained inside a lightbox?
[23:48:59] <abjorn> I can't imagine that would be terribly difficult
[23:49:00] <heyho_> like the next and prev button but just with images
[23:49:14] <abjorn> I can't think of any plugin that does that, though, if that's what you're asking
[23:49:18] <tw2113> ah pagination inside the lightbox
[23:49:29] <tw2113> via images instead of next/prev
[23:49:29] <heyho_> jes a pagination
[23:50:17] <heyho_> so there is no plugin known? hmm
[23:50:48] <abjorn> not by me
[23:51:08] <tw2113> i imagine it wouldn't be the hardest ever to have the first level load an iframe of a separate page containing a lightbox instance that uses images to paginat
[23:51:09] <tw2113> e
[23:51:34] <heyho_> i think thats the solution
[23:51:50] <heyho_> loading an frame with a lightbox that contains what i nedd
[23:51:52] <heyho_> need
[23:52:11] <heyho_> thx for your help
