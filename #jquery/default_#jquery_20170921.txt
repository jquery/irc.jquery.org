[02:08:41] <swest> Hello, just wondering if anyone has come across a bug in Jquery UI comboboxes (autocomplete) where it only validates the first combobox on a form if it's marked as required?
[02:18:57] <solice> wouldn't surprise me, i wouldn't use anything jquery ui
[02:27:43] <undefined_bob> morning
[03:03:28] <Duikb00t> hello
[03:03:32] <Duikb00t> I have a small issue.
[03:05:00] <undefined_bob> Duikb00t: just ask :)
[03:05:11] <Duikb00t> IYeah I know still setting up my fiddle :D
[03:06:53] <Duikb00t> So: undefined_bob  https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/3/
[03:07:19] <Duikb00t> I am trying to create sub fieldsets for 'partners' when selecting a radio button.
[03:07:27] <Duikb00t> Now it works but it's doing too many duplicates
[03:07:55] <Duikb00t> and it's not removing them when I click an other radio button. I tried doing  that in a reset method where I remove the fieldset which I clone over and over again everytime...
[03:08:02] <Duikb00t> But then it removes them all.
[03:08:12] <Duikb00t> I also tried not:first way but that also results in an error :s
[03:15:06] <Duikb00t> Line: https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/4/  12 and 14 is what should happend.
[03:15:08] <Duikb00t> happen*
[03:23:29] <Cork> Duikb00t: you mean that you get three groups for each button click?
[03:23:46] <Duikb00t> Bu1 option: = MAX 3 fieldsets being generate.d
[03:24:01] <Duikb00t> 2 options: MAX 8 fieldsets being generated.
[03:24:24] <Duikb00t> But when I change
[03:24:53] <Duikb00t> The radio buttons, it should all be reset, and also the counter should be set to 0. Now its sometimes duplicating 2 times or even more.
[03:25:00] <Duikb00t> I miss somewhere something important imo.
[03:25:14] <Cork> Duikb00t: don't bind the click handler in loadPartnerCloneModule
[03:25:20] <Cork> bind it statically
[03:25:33] <Cork> currently you bind it each time the radio buttons are changed in the top section
[03:25:44] <Cork> resulting in adding multiple copies
[03:25:51] <Duikb00t> As in: outside that mehotd
[03:26:10] <Cork> yes
[03:26:18] <Duikb00t> And about the variables like
[03:26:24] <Duikb00t>  var count = 0;
[03:26:25] <Cork> .data
[03:26:30] <Duikb00t> and var $partnersWrapper = $('.partners-wrapper');
[03:26:33] <Duikb00t> those 2
[03:26:40] <Duikb00t> should also not be in the click handler?
[03:27:19] <Duikb00t> ( https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/7/  )
[03:29:28] <Duikb00t> This one is a bit more clean: https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/11/
[03:32:33] <Cork> Duikb00t: something like this https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/12/
[03:33:06] <Cork> ah, missed the show code
[03:33:22] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/13/
[03:34:15] <Duikb00t> Hmm
[03:34:37] <Duikb00t> (index):74 Uncaught ReferenceError: count is not defined   ;p
[03:34:39] <Duikb00t> wait eh
[03:34:46] <Duikb00t>      $clone.removeClass('template');
[03:35:06] <Cork> ah... that makes things a bit more complicated
[03:38:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/14/
[03:39:46] <Duikb00t> I don't know how
[03:40:02] <Duikb00t> but when I play with it it's possible to generate like 3 fieldsets in option 2
[03:40:11] <Duikb00t> and when I Switch over to option 1 to see there a add button  ><
[03:40:17] <Duikb00t> but yeah this is already really nice :D
[03:40:19] <Duikb00t>  almost
[03:40:21] <Duikb00t> there
[03:40:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: you need to show/hide the button in the loadPartnerCloneModule function
[03:40:48] <Cork> the show/hide only happens in the click handler
[03:41:08] <Cork> actually only the hide happens in the click handler
[03:41:23] <Cork> hmm, actually
[03:41:31] <Cork> its better to just replace the show method
[03:41:54] <Duikb00t> Hmmmm :D
[03:46:23] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/mdg24xu5/18/
[03:58:38] <Duikb00t> checking
[05:30:32] <paul_uk> hi all, has anyone seen a library that does the same as this control (at the bottom) https://i.imgur.com/qpXvAxQ.png  it's essentially a 24hr 7 day date-range in blocks and allows a user to block out specific time groups.  Thanks
[07:49:17] <moldy> hi
[07:49:28] <moldy> hi
[07:49:42] <moldy> "Event handlers bound to an element are called in the same order that they were bound." are there any special cases where this would not be true?
[07:49:58] <moldy> i am binding first a click and then a change handler to a <select> element. the change handler seems to run first.
[07:53:09] <Cork> moldy: on<event> attributes mess with that a bit
[07:53:15] <Cork> make sure you don't have them
[07:53:37] <Cork> also delegated events fire after the ones bound directly on the element
[07:54:31] <moldy> Cork: what does "on<event> attributes" mean?
[07:54:38] <moldy> i am binding the events to the exact same jquery object
[07:54:47] <moldy> trying to produce a minimal example right now
[07:54:49] <Cork> ex <select onclick="funcitonName()">
[07:55:55] <moldy> Cork: ah ok
[07:56:08] <Cork> but your problem is most likely delegated events
[07:56:48] <Cork> (they fire when the event has bubbled to the parent they are delegate to)
[07:57:46] <moldy> Cork: https://dpaste.de/GTPv
[07:57:55] <moldy> change is fired before click here, according to the console log
[07:58:13] <Cork> please use jsfiddle.net next time
[07:58:29] <Cork> moldy: those are two different events
[07:58:34] <moldy> ah sorry
[07:58:41] <Cork> event types are fired in specific orders
[07:58:47] <moldy> Cork: ahh, i see
[07:58:57] <Cork> its specified in the dom spec
[08:01:43] <Cork> moldy: https://jsfiddle.net/v4cu3a7L/
[08:02:30] <moldy> i'm too stupid to use jsfiddle, hehe
[08:02:53] <moldy> ok, i see, thanks
[08:06:08] <fn> getting some msgs on console: Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchmove' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive.
[08:06:13] <fn> can i hide this in prod?
[08:10:02] <fn> nvm
[08:24:49] <SpecialTech> good morning
[08:33:19] <fn> y0 SpecialTech
[09:27:02] <nisseni> I'm making a $.post where I want to send one regular variable and a serialized form. I can't get it working properly. Any idea on how to achieve this?
[09:38:57] <Cork> nisseni: use serializeArray and then just append it as a {name: '', value } object
[09:39:47] <nisseni> Cork: found this solution: order_form+'&item_id='+item_id (order_form is the serialized form)
[09:39:53] <Cork> so var data = $(form).serializeArray(); data.push({ name: 'my', value: true }); $.post(url, data)
[09:40:02] <Cork> nisseni: no, don't use that
[09:40:04] <Cork> its messy
[09:40:47] <nisseni> Cork: it worked perfectly for me.
[09:40:47] <Cork> nisseni: that won't properly escape & characters in item_id for example
[09:40:57] <Cork> and several other problems
[09:41:02] <nisseni> Ah, I see
[09:57:43] <Duikb00t> æthx Cork
[10:31:43] <Labsz> What's a simple solution to not make my populate() keep adding items, I just wanted it to update whenever I changed selectedIndex, heh... https://hastebin.com/ufumagizaw.js
[10:38:13] <hybridwebdev> say I have a nested list of elements, how do I use jquery to build an a nested array based on the structure of the elements
[10:39:41] <hybridwebdev> https://jsfiddle.net/ak53xgda/
[10:40:21] <grapheti> back again, eh?
[10:40:49] <hybridwebdev> still stuck
[10:40:54] <grapheti> I thought we weren't worth your $80 time. :D
[10:41:03] <grapheti> $80/hr*
[10:41:08] <hybridwebdev> can i please just get some help instead of people questioning why i need to do what i'm doing
[10:41:21] <Labsz> your fiddle looks kinda err
[10:41:24] <grapheti> Didn't question what you're doing.
[10:41:46] <grapheti> Stating what you said last time.
[10:41:50] <grapheti> That we were a waste of your time.
[10:41:56] <hybridwebdev> all i want is an array that represents the nested structure of the elements
[10:42:19] <grapheti> obv we're not if you still need help
[10:42:23] <hybridwebdev> grapheti please stop trying to derail my question
[10:43:33] <grapheti> Also, it was suggested that you use map and recursion.
[10:44:08] <hybridwebdev> sigh
[10:44:22] <hybridwebdev> @grapheti can you please stop, i've already asked you once
[10:44:33] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/kGisi63.png
[10:44:57] <hybridwebdev> exactly, you're trolling....i've now asked twice
[10:45:07] <Labsz> grapheti: Sounds like he thinks you should be grateful that you get the honor of being asked a question
[10:45:08] <grapheti> grapheti  Also, it was suggested that you use map and recursion.
[10:45:17] <hybridwebdev> sigh
[10:45:25] <hybridwebdev> like wtf is wrong with you?
[10:45:41] <hybridwebdev> When someone comes in seeking help, either help them....or keep quiet
[10:45:49] <grapheti> lmao
[10:45:53] <hybridwebdev> you're defeating the purpose of the chat room
[10:46:03] <Labsz> helpdesk*
[10:46:04] <Labsz> :D
[10:46:13] <grapheti> should we code it for you too?
[10:46:33] <grapheti> since you don't take suggestions
[10:46:38] <grapheti> as I've said twice
[10:46:41] <hybridwebdev> okay this is the third and final time....fuck off man
[10:46:49] <hybridwebdev> i dont wanna hear you
[10:46:50] <grapheti> third time - grapheti  Also, it was suggested that you use map and recursion.
[10:49:06] <grapheti> Labsz, hehe
[10:49:19] <grapheti> Trolls are early this morning.
[10:49:26] <grapheti> ayyy taplar
[10:49:26] <hybridwebdev> dude
[10:49:31] <hybridwebdev> you're the fucking troll
[10:49:35] <grapheti> remember this guy?
[10:49:35] <taplar> morning
[10:49:38] <grapheti> :P
[10:49:41] <taplar> sup?
[10:49:46] <grapheti> nm youi?
[10:49:47] <grapheti> you*
[10:50:00] <taplar> network issues in the office.  annoying, :(
[10:50:05] <grapheti> :/
[10:50:16] <grapheti> dem nets
[10:50:21] <taplar> hybridwebdev: i mentioned yesterday that to do what you want you'd have to do some sort of solution with recursion to build the result that you are after
[10:50:23] <hybridwebdev> i don't know why you're so determined to make sure i don't find help graph. Is your life that pathetic?
[10:50:37] <grapheti> :D
[10:50:49] <hybridwebdev> @taplar, that's not an answer
[10:50:53] <taplar> but it is
[10:50:58] <hybridwebdev> no its not
[10:51:04] <taplar> i disagree
[10:51:08] <taplar> what do you not understand about it?
[10:51:20] <hybridwebdev> thats like saying "How do I fix my engine" - "Take it apart, do stuff and then put it back together"
[10:51:27] <taplar> no, it's not
[10:51:29] <hybridwebdev> jesus fuck
[10:51:33] <taplar> recursion is a discrete operation
[10:51:42] <hybridwebdev> why have a jquery channel if no one helps?
[10:51:51] <grapheti> lmao
[10:51:58] <grapheti> this guy :D
[10:52:04] <hybridwebdev> dude
[10:52:05] <hybridwebdev> fuck
[10:52:06] <hybridwebdev> off
[10:52:09] <grapheti> haha
[10:52:36] <taplar> hybridwebdev: maybe try stackoverflow if you disagree with the opinions offered here
[10:52:51] <hybridwebdev> because I haven't already done that
[10:52:56] <hybridwebdev> lord
[10:53:01] <Labsz> hybridwebdev: I asked a question too mate, but you gotta respect- its free help/advice
[10:53:05] <Labsz> If you dont get it you dont get it
[10:53:25] <Labsz> I dont think your dumbfounded attitude is gonna get you closer to a solution
[10:53:27] <hybridwebdev> i guess the bottom line is....idiots like graph, when they don't know something, just insult the person for asking
[10:53:39] <taplar> have i insulted you?
[10:54:04] <hybridwebdev> @taplar you're not contributing to the solution no
[10:54:08] <taplar> lol
[10:54:13] <grapheti> :D
[10:54:15] <hybridwebdev> consider this
[10:54:25] <taplar> if by contributing you mean 'rwrite it for you' then no
[10:54:25] <hybridwebdev> how would you feel if you asked for help and just got ridiculed for it
[10:54:33] <taplar> how have i ridiculed you?
[10:54:41] <hybridwebdev> wow
[10:54:45] <taplar> i've told you the concept to achieve what you want. and you have blown it off
[10:54:54] <taplar> i could write it in a few moments
[10:55:08] <hybridwebdev> because "Use map/recursion" is the same as my engine example
[10:55:18] <taplar> no it's not, if you understand what recursion is
[10:55:29] <hybridwebdev> how are you even a mod with your attitude?
[10:55:36] <taplar> i'm not a mod
[10:55:46] <Labsz> taplar for mod 2017
[10:55:50] <grapheti> LOL
[10:55:52] <hybridwebdev> your name was red a minute ago
[10:55:57] <grapheti> I'll vote for you taplar
[10:55:57] <taplar> huh?
[10:56:02] <Labsz> it's when you mentions someones name..
[10:56:03] <Labsz> probably
[10:56:04] <hybridwebdev> oh for
[10:56:23] <Labsz> Well when someone mentions you* rather
[10:56:26] <hybridwebdev> okay let me rephrase
[10:56:45] <hybridwebdev> why do you bother coming in here if you don't intend to help people
[10:57:02] <grapheti> what's your definition of help?
[10:57:05] <taplar> i'd have to ask if others think i am helping.  i think i am
[10:57:05] <hybridwebdev> are you really that bored and pathetic, that you have to sit in an IRC chat room and troll people looking for help?
[10:57:27] <grapheti> spoon feeding or giving suggestions?
[10:57:38] <hybridwebdev> dude
[10:57:43] <hybridwebdev> shut up
[10:57:44] <taplar> hybridwebdev: if you disagree with people's opinions, that's fine.  however you are being very antagonistic at the moement
[10:57:48] <grapheti> obv giving suggestions isn't working
[10:57:56] <hybridwebdev> @taplar I'
[10:58:31] <hybridwebdev> @taplar I'M being antagonistic? I'm sorry if i'm getting annoyed that i'm being trolled, and that dickheads are trying to derail me achieving assistance
[10:58:41] <grapheti> First. You need to calm down.
[10:58:50] <hybridwebdev> how dare i get annoyed
[10:59:03] <grapheti> Second, what's wrong with the suggestion of recursion?
[10:59:17] <grapheti> technically
[11:00:01] <hybridwebdev> grapheti i bet you're the kind of person that has an SO account solely for the purpose of downvoting peoples answers
[11:00:08] <grapheti> grapheti  Second, what's wrong with the suggestion of recursion?
[11:00:36] <hybridwebdev> it's like, the thought of people getting help bothers you and you go out of your way to ensure they don't get the help
[11:00:47] <grapheti> doesn't get through the skull I guess
[11:00:48] <grapheti> grapheti  Second, what's wrong with the suggestion of recursion?
[11:00:57] <hybridwebdev> sigh
[11:01:02] <hybridwebdev> back to googling i guess
[11:01:07] <grapheti> lmao
[11:01:41] <grapheti> learn recursion while you're there
[11:01:49] <taplar> lets just drop it
[11:01:50] <hybridwebdev> ........
[11:01:59] <grapheti> kk moving on
[11:01:59] <hybridwebdev> i really wish i could fucking punch you graph
[11:02:03] <hybridwebdev> like....hard
[11:02:10] <grapheti> sounds sexy
[11:02:17] <hybridwebdev> idiot
[11:02:23] <grapheti> you into BDSM too ;)
[11:02:40] <hybridwebdev> yay i found the ignore button
[11:02:44] <grapheti> how's the weather taplar?
[11:02:57] <taplar> pretty good, it's cooling off finally i think
[11:03:31] <grapheti> 92 here, but it's windy
[11:03:38] <grapheti> so doesn't seem like it
[11:04:17] <taplar> it's muggy here.  not baton rouge muggy, but still
[11:04:20] <grapheti> been doing some automated testing today
[11:04:34] <grapheti> ye
[11:05:04] <grapheti> well, unit/automated testing
[11:05:15] <grapheti> both
[11:05:16] <taplar> what library?
[11:05:37] <grapheti> Selenium C# and XUnit
[11:05:48] <grapheti> ASP.NET C# app
[11:06:21] <taplar> cool. i was messing with selenium a while back.  i prefer it over sahi personally
[11:06:33] <prillian5> I've two lists "sortable". At the first list I've an input-textfield.
[11:06:59] <grapheti> yeah, I'd seen watir and others.
[11:07:26] <grapheti> I've*
[11:07:31] <prillian5> Now I wan't to drag and dorp it to list 2. If I drop it into list2, the input should be leave in this list, but in List1 should spawan a new input-field
[11:08:06] <taplar> prillian5: are you using anything already for the drag-n-drop functionality?
[11:08:21] <prillian5> Look & Feel for user should be like drag & drop icons... you can drag&drop as much field as you like to a given area
[11:08:27] <prillian5> yes, I still use it.
[11:08:53] <taplar> i mean, are you using a library or a plugin currently to do that?
[11:09:02] <taplar> or maybe that's not what your question is about
[11:12:48] <prillian5> @taplar I use jquery-ui
[11:12:54] <prillian5> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#items
[11:12:56] <taplar> k
[11:13:57] <prillian5> currently I would do it like this: Catch the receive-event on a list, and inside of this, create an new textfield and push it to the "old" list.
[11:14:04] <prillian5> or is there an easier way
[11:14:59] <taplar> my initial thought was that in the drop event on the new list you'd create a duplicate of the element dropped, and then let the original return to it's original list
[11:16:11] <taplar> kinda like this guy i think
[11:16:13] <taplar> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[11:16:25] <taplar> except you'd be creating the new guy and canceling the drop
[11:16:35] <taplar> or like you said, you could let it drop and then recreate it in the original
[11:19:36] <prillian5> ok. thought maybe there is a build-in way to do this.
[11:19:39] <prillian5> thanks so far.t
[11:20:33] <taplar> there may be, but i'm not familiar with it
[11:30:54] <prillian5> ok, thanks
[11:57:22] <desperek> hi
[11:57:38] <desperek> so jquery just selects 1st element if $ is called
[11:57:41] <desperek> $$ doesnt work
[11:57:45] <desperek> jquery prod. 1.4.1
[11:58:04] <taplar> what are you doing?
[11:58:14] <taplar> selecting by an id?
[11:58:20] <desperek> taplar, yup
[11:58:25] <taplar> id's can't be repeated
[11:58:27] <taplar> it's invalid markup
[11:58:29] <desperek> oh
[11:58:31] <desperek> thanks
[12:21:10] <grapheti> It took almost no time for them to discover that an online portal designed to let Equifax employees in Argentina manage credit report disputes from consumers in that country was wide open, protected by perhaps the most easy-to-guess password combination ever: “admin/admin.” :D
[12:21:17] <grapheti> https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/ayuda-help-equifax-has-my-data/
[12:25:29] <taplar> heh
[12:52:48] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: hey robert, i used the changes you suggested in my ajax and now the error: callback works!!
[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> cool
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> using .then() and .catch()?
[12:53:27] <randymarsh9> yep
[12:53:32] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix your server so you aren't hitting that failure case.
[12:53:47] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[12:55:08] <randymarsh9> yea not sure what i'm going to put there yet but at least it works now
[12:55:19] <robertmaxrees> are you still using datatype: 'json'?
[12:55:24] <randymarsh9> anyway ty!
[12:55:29] <randymarsh9> lol no
[12:55:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're returning a 404 or something then.
[12:55:46] <robertmaxrees> either way, good times!
[13:06:05] * taplar is happy he has the interwebz again
[13:06:34] <robertmaxrees> were your innabuttz down?
[13:07:01] <taplar> ya, they did some sort of network vlan move or something that brought down our wireless network
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:07:16] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:07:28] <taplar> and seeing as not everyone has a hot ethernet port, derp
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> oh damn
[13:08:39] <robertmaxrees> how many people in your office?
[13:08:53] <taplar> mmmm, 100 or so on the floor?
[13:09:38] <taplar> i think it's just the agile areas that are not fully enternet enabled though
[13:56:11] <plamb> will a call to .text() grab the nearest descendents text
[13:56:24] <plamb> if the element im calling it on has no text
[13:56:37] <taplar> iirc, it will get the text of all the containing elements
[13:56:45] <plamb> i see
[13:58:52] <taplar> yeah it recursively gets the text of the children
[13:59:37] <plamb> in an event handler like this
[13:59:38] <plamb> $('.additional').on('click','li',function(e)
[13:59:48] <plamb> $(this) refers to the .additional elem ?
[13:59:51] <taplar> the li
[14:00:21] <taplar> r/the/an
[14:01:04] <Uhkis> taplar: dude, that was so wrong :-D
[14:01:09] <taplar> hmm?
[14:01:36] <Uhkis> 1) is s as in substitute 2) you skipped the / from the end
[14:01:43] <Uhkis> it's*
[14:02:07] <taplar> you mean r/the/an/ ?
[14:02:11] <Uhkis> yes
[14:02:55] <taplar> hey, at least give me credit that i said 'an' instead of 'a' , :D
[14:03:23] <Uhkis> well, both are kinda correct, so you couldn't go wrong :D
[14:04:18] <taplar> hmm
[14:04:48] <taplar> so it'd be 'a li' if you read it as 'a list item', but 'an li' if you read it as 'an el-eye'
[14:04:51] <taplar> ?  lol
[14:04:59] <Uhkis> "L I" characters or "li" as a word
[14:05:17] <Uhkis> exactly :)
[14:08:43] * taplar fist pumps
[14:09:36] <Uhkis> you may wanna keep that to yourself! ;D
[14:10:00] <taplar> nah, not after i had to ask awkwardcough what that motion was called
[14:10:08] <taplar> i was too committed at that point
[14:10:26] <Uhkis> in the future, you may want to fist bump instead
[14:30:33] <samsamek> I need a html element to store a json object in (as an alternative to <script type=“application/json”>)
[14:30:45] <samsamek> what element would be suited for this purpose?
[14:31:10] <taplar> you mean it being stored like that on page load?
[14:31:22] <samsamek> yes
[14:31:39] <taplar> maybe a template element.
[14:31:47] <taplar> what's not working with the script tag?
[14:32:05] <samsamek> long story, the cms system can’t output it in the right location (before </body>
[14:32:19] <taplar> huh
[14:32:22] <samsamek> I tried selecting the <script id=“data”> for hours, I gave up
[14:32:30] <samsamek> I think its because its nested somewhere in the body
[14:32:32] <samsamek> brb
[14:32:36] <samsamek> gotta switch trains
[14:32:57] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAbpPHCH_I
[14:33:30] <grapheti> https://youtu.be/jMAbpPHCH_I?t=47s :D
[14:33:38] <taplar> i think what i'm calling a template element may be a script tag so that may not be a thing
[14:34:45] <taplar> lol
[14:35:26] <grapheti> redneck fun lol
[14:35:44] <taplar> not enough mud to be redneck fun
[14:37:21] <taplar> used to be some guys here at my place that would go muddin on the weekends.  i remember cause it surprised me that there was a mudding place in the city
[14:39:22] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template  nvm
[14:39:52] <taplar> no support for IE, i wonder how it will treat it.
[14:39:56] * taplar goes to play
[14:40:38] <taplar> ugh
[14:41:24] <taplar> could probably style it so that its hidden in any case
[14:41:41] <taplar> yeaaaaah
[14:44:11] <grapheti> taplar haha
[14:44:18] <grapheti> nice
[14:44:33] <grapheti> taplar, also, that guy left :P
[14:44:46] <taplar> i know, just prepping, :)
[14:44:50] <grapheti> hehe
[14:54:35] <hellyeah> o/
[14:54:56] <taplar> sup
[14:56:51] <hellyeah> working on my blog
[14:57:03] <hellyeah> how about you?
[14:57:10] <taplar> random stuff
[15:00:15] <samsamek> back
[15:00:41] <taplar> alright, so you should be able to use these guys: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[15:01:16] <taplar> one caveat being that IE doesn't understand what they are, so you'll want to css style them with a display: none most likely
[15:03:01] <grapheti> wb
[15:05:52] <hellyeah> i learnt smt about Page Life Cycle today
[15:06:02] <hellyeah> DOMContentLoaded and async
[15:06:08] <grapheti> look how pretty this is - https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/o49v04kv/2/
[15:06:27] <hellyeah> i guess these two key words do what $(document).ready(...) does
[15:06:43] <taplar> grapheti: nice
[15:07:07] <grapheti> ye, loving this https://redom.js.org/
[15:08:07] <samsamek> Tadas: ah cool, never seen that before
[15:08:40] <samsamek> By the way, it’s correct that <script> elements should be placed right before </body> at the “top level” right?
[15:08:45] <hellyeah> graingert:  can i use that in react native?
[15:09:06] <taplar> react already has it's own two way binding
[15:09:14] <hellyeah> react native
[15:09:26] <graingert> on my pebble!
[15:09:29] <hellyeah> samsamek:  if you use $(document).ready(..)
[15:09:36] <hellyeah> you can call it in head
[15:09:59] <hellyeah> $(document).read(..) will guarantee dom is loaded
[15:10:38] <samsamek> I see
[15:11:03] <robertmaxrees> *dom is ready. "load" is distinct fwiw.
[15:11:37] <hellyeah> windows.load document.load?
[15:11:48] <robertmaxrees> window load and document ready
[15:12:19] <hellyeah> $(document).read( .. ) is document.addEventListener(DOMContentLoaded, function() i read today
[15:13:04] <hellyeah> <script async
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> ah that's what you're talking about.
[15:13:22] <hellyeah> yeah robertmaxrees if you use that with <script async
[15:13:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:13:38] <robertmaxrees> i know what async does ;)
[15:13:40] <hellyeah> that guarantee javascript and dom is loaded and parsed
[15:13:53] <hellyeah> i just try to clear my mind
[15:13:58] <robertmaxrees> normally when you say "load" it implies something different than domcontentloaded
[15:14:10] <hellyeah> load is different event i read
[15:14:55] <hellyeah> domcontentloaded and script async does not guarantee javascript and dom will wait each other. Is that true?
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> lol i'm being pedantic.  you said "$(document).read(..) will guarantee dom is loaded" - I was pointing out that load and ready are distinct.
[15:15:20] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i see
[15:15:22] <taplar> for some reason i want to say that the two are not 1:1
[15:15:30] <robertmaxrees> https://eager.io/blog/how-to-decide-when-your-code-should-run/
[15:15:34] <hellyeah> dom is parsed?
[15:15:51] <hellyeah> can i say dom is parsed instead of dom is loaded
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> that's better
[15:16:17] <hellyeah> okay
[15:16:34] <hellyeah> i see
[15:16:44] <robertmaxrees> :B
[15:17:30] <graingert> taplar: hellyeah react has one way binding
[15:18:08] <taplar> i couldn't say for certain
[15:18:32] <robertmaxrees> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html
[15:18:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:18:46] <taplar> but what do ya know, 3x does do that event listener
[15:19:07] <taplar> makes sense, with them removing support for older ie versions
[15:21:03] <taplar> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.js
[15:21:10] <taplar> hellyeah: search for: // Older IE sometimes signals "interactive" too soon
[15:22:15] <hellyeah> okay
[15:36:45] <`ULT> Hello, I`m experimenting a litle bit with :before.
[15:36:53] <`ULT> I`m wondering why my if/else is not working correct
[15:36:55] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/51hku8yk/1/
[15:39:47] <taplar> `ULT: you may want to ask ##javascript
[15:39:53] <`ULT> Yes oke.
[15:40:00] <`ULT> I was thinking there is not a lot jquery in it :p
[15:40:14] <`ULT> Oke, I will ask in javascript
[15:40:19] <`ULT> You dont know the answer?
[15:40:30] <taplar> oh, lol
[15:40:31] <`ULT> I know :before is not part of the dom.
[15:40:31] <AwkwardCough> check what your if statement condition is
[15:40:37] <taplar> single '=' in the if
[15:40:48] <`ULT> Yes, I tried also with two and three
[15:40:54] <robertmaxrees> if (content = "0") { will always return true
[15:41:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/51hku8yk/2/
[15:42:08] <`ULT> robertmaxrees, this give also not the correct result
[15:42:31] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/go23oj
[15:42:37] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to get?
[15:42:56] <robertmaxrees> and what browser are you using?
[15:43:15] <`ULT> I`m using latest version Chrome
[15:43:39] <`ULT> The :after value is changed bases on screenwidth
[15:43:46] <taplar> hah
[15:43:53] <taplar> do === '"0"'
[15:43:54] <`ULT> and I would like to do someting based on that value
[15:44:00] <taplar> there are quotes in the string
[15:44:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/51hku8yk/3/
[15:44:59] <`ULT> without using on resize
[15:45:40] <robertmaxrees> taplar's is working for me.
[15:45:43] <`ULT> yes taplar
[15:45:48] <`ULT> that is working, thank you.
[15:45:53] <`ULT> and you also robertmaxrees
[15:45:58] <taplar> i had to debugger; to see that, lol
[15:46:14] <`ULT> where can I read something about =, == and === ?
[15:46:32] <robertmaxrees> erm, that's easy.
[15:46:34] <taplar> = is assignment, == is equality with type coersion, === is equality without type coersion
[15:46:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:46:49] <taplar> 1 == "1" <- true
[15:46:50] <`ULT> And another question. How good/ bad is this instead of using .resize
[15:46:54] <taplar> 1 === "1" <- false
[15:47:09] <`ULT> Thanks!
[15:47:14] <`ULT> that makes sence
[15:47:30] <`ULT> sense
[15:48:38] <robertmaxrees> `ULT could you clarify?
[15:49:12] <`ULT> Yes I wil work out my example and clarify it
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> you mean using this to detect screen size instead of checking in a resize handler?>
[15:50:28] <taplar> ☺
[15:50:28] <hellyeah> `ULT:  type coercion
[15:50:45] <hellyeah> === avoid type coercion
[15:50:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:51:00] <hellyeah> did i say something wrong?
[15:51:03] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah we covered that already :)
[15:51:12] <robertmaxrees> taplar gave examples and stuff ;)
[15:51:23] * taplar is sad cause he can't find the cents char code in time for a joke
[15:51:37] <grapheti> lol
[15:52:23] <hellyeah> sorry

[15:57:10] <robertmaxrees> *lawyer
[15:57:10] <grapheti> sweet
[15:57:14] <grapheti> Equifax?
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:57:20] <robertmaxrees> divorce
[15:57:22] <grapheti> jkjk
[15:57:25] <grapheti> ah
[15:57:41] <taplar> if you stalked him on twitter you'd know that already
[15:57:50] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> i think i've made, like, 2 mentions of it there?
[15:58:40] <taplar> idk.  i think i looked a while back after you had been out for a few days and i saw something
[15:58:52] <`ULT> back, that is what I mean indeed robertmaxrees
[15:59:05] <`ULT> using the mediaquerys to dectect screensize
[15:59:07] <robertmaxrees> `ULT so... why do you need to do that with JS?
[15:59:09] <`ULT> instead of resize handler
[15:59:17] <robertmaxrees> like, what are going to do witht that info?
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:02:52] <`ULT> I need the screenwidth to set the correct offset for this https://jsfiddle.net/38a3vboh/
[16:03:19] <`ULT> when screensize is > x there is a sticky header
[16:04:53] <`ULT> And I heared that .resize is not verry good practise (need debouncing or throttling)
[16:05:18] <taplar> same goes for scroll
[16:05:26] <`ULT> So I thougt maybe it is a good idea to use media querys for this
[16:05:39] <taplar> if you can do it with mq, i'd suggest it
[16:05:41] <`ULT> But I would like to hear your opinon about this
[16:05:46] <`ULT> Maybe it doesnt make any sense
[16:05:54] <`ULT> I didnt see this before.
[16:07:05] <`ULT> so you would prefer something like this taplar? https://jsfiddle.net/51hku8yk/3/
[16:07:45] <taplar> is the sticky header always there, just hidden?
[16:07:58] <taplar> or is it a menu that you are conditionally turning into a sticky header?
[16:08:50] <`ULT> I pm your the real link if you dont mind.
[16:09:02] <taplar> sure
[16:09:05] <`ULT> thanks
[16:22:24] <taplar> so is the issue that you are trying to account for the screen switching from sticky and non-sticky mode?
[16:22:52] <taplar> so the screen doesn't scroll when that transition happens?
[16:24:21] <`ULT> Yes, setting the correct offset for `smoothscrolling` deppening if header is sticky or not
[16:25:06] <taplar> so i guess i have to ask how often you expect users to do this
[16:25:39] <taplar> is a user on a desktop really going to view your site in < 651?
[16:25:51] <taplar> and do so by resizing so that transition happens?
[16:26:09] <`ULT> And related to that, a general question. Is it better to detect screensize with setting a value for :after, :before
[16:26:17] <`ULT> or using .resize for this
[16:26:26] <taplar> i have no clue about that.
[16:26:41] <taplar> but a part of me wants to avoid the issue entirely
[16:26:44] <`ULT> taplar, the transition is not the problem
[16:26:56] <`ULT> some people visit the site on there mobile
[16:27:01] <`ULT> and than the offset is not correct
[16:27:08] <taplar> it's possible that you could put a span or div or something around that element that has a fixed width and height of the sticky menu
[16:27:10] <`ULT> because there is no stickyheader
[16:27:19] <taplar> then when that sticky header transitions, that area remains
[16:27:27] <taplar> thus no page height changes
[16:27:38] <taplar> but you might want to ask ##css about that
[16:27:48] <`ULT> I make a screencap for you
[16:30:20] <hellyeah> `ULT:  i guess there is method called getClientRedirect
[16:30:23] <hellyeah> or something
[16:31:51] <taplar> ooooh, i think i see what you're talking about
[16:32:11] <taplar> if it's not sticky, the auto scroll doesn't go down far enough
[16:32:47] <`ULT> correct taplar
[16:32:51] <`ULT> that is the problem indeed.
[16:32:57] <`ULT> This is correct scrolling: https://www.screencast.com/t/vVvBqRH2t
[16:34:17] <`ULT> And this not: https://www.screencast.com/t/nvG4V6tx1T2
[16:35:04] <`ULT> and it doesn`t go far down enough, because the offset and the fact the sticky header is not showing
[16:35:27] <`ULT> So I need to set the offset, depending on the screenwith
[16:35:44] <taplar> or depending upon if the header is sticky or not
[16:35:55] <`ULT> right.
[16:35:55] <taplar> really that's your determinant, right?
[16:36:05] <`ULT> yes
[16:36:24] <taplar> so can you use that calculated styles method, or whatever, to see if the header has position fixed?
[16:37:11] <`ULT> what do you mean with calculated styles method?
[16:37:21] <taplar> getComputedStyles
[16:37:38] <`ULT> Yes, this: https://jsfiddle.net/51hku8yk/3/
[16:37:49] <taplar> right
[16:37:53] <`ULT> with getComputedStyles I can read the value of :before
[16:37:55] <taplar> can you get 'position' off of that?
[16:37:59] <`ULT> yes
[16:38:09] <taplar> so if you can get that and it === 'fixed'
[16:38:17] <taplar> adjust your offset
[16:38:20] <`ULT> yes indeed, that is also possible
[16:38:27] <`ULT> that is better :p
[16:38:33] <taplar> :)
[16:38:37] <`ULT> instead of setting a value for before
[16:38:38] <`ULT> haha
[16:38:48] <`ULT> with media queries
[16:39:02] <`ULT> I can indeed way better read the position with getcomputedstyles
[16:39:26] <`ULT> I will try that. Thanks
[16:39:29] <taplar> sure
[17:05:02] <`ULT> taplar, this was all what I need: https://jsfiddle.net/51hku8yk/4/
[17:05:16] <taplar> :)
[17:06:43] <`ULT> and now its time for a breaking bad episode :)
[17:13:54] <Neo1> taplar: hi
[17:14:23] <Neo1> taplar: I listened your advise and creating now own framework
[17:15:41] <Neo1> this is want I made only https://github.com/kselax/kselax-framework
[17:17:11] <taplar> Neo1: what was this in relation to?
[17:17:42] <Neo1> taplar: what?
[17:17:56] <taplar> the creating your own framework thing
[17:18:08] <Neo1> taplar: for increase performance
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:18:21] <Neo1> taplar: I there wrapped jQuery UI functions
[17:18:32] <Neo1> taplar: only one, will wrap many
[17:19:18] <robertmaxrees> failing to see how that's a framework.
[17:19:32] <Neo1> taplar: do you know jQueyr UI? There difficult create combobox, I created my own function and put there all code which originate combobox and now easy call it and all work. One row instead many...
[17:19:45] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what?
[17:20:10] <taplar> ah
[17:20:23] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes that is my framework, css grid and one function
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not a framework heh
[17:20:41] <robertmaxrees> you just make a plugin ;)
[17:20:44] <robertmaxrees> *made
[17:20:51] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: why? little framework for fast build forms
[17:20:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not a framework heh
[17:21:05] <taplar> how many times are you calling my_combobox?
[17:22:34] <Neo1> taplar: will always when will need add search to jqueyr ui dialog, just inside that dialog not supporting select2.I always use it instead
[17:22:52] <Neo1> combobox has bad look, select2 is very pretty
[17:23:02] <Neo1> taplar: many
[17:23:08] <taplar> you probably want to pull that out of that method then
[17:23:12] <Neo1> taplar: it's always need almost in each project
[17:23:55] <taplar> line 4-132 should probably be on it's own inside an IIFE
[17:24:17] <Neo1> taplar: what? out from? No I will that call when will need, just my_combobox('selector'); instead do much work like was before. Say this is very cool
[17:24:24] <taplar> you don't want to redefine that widget in jQuery every time you run that method
[17:24:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:24:36] <robertmaxrees> "Say this is very cool" lol
[17:24:37] <Neo1> taplar: yes exactly
[17:24:58] <Neo1> taplar: I want wrap there $.ajax function too
[17:24:58] <taplar> as you have it, you are recreating what that widget is each time that method is called
[17:25:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ which is slow.
[17:25:49] <Neo1> taplar: yes , it's very useful
[17:25:56] <taplar> no, it's overkill
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:26:03] <Neo1> taplar: why and how?
[17:26:09] <taplar> it's not necessary to redefine it over and over
[17:26:16] <taplar> you define it once, and reuse it
[17:26:44] <Neo1> taplar: you mean about function my_combobox?
[17:26:49] <taplar> no
[17:26:51] <taplar> the widget
[17:26:58] <Neo1> taplar: what the widget?
[17:27:04] <taplar> line 4-132
[17:27:18] <Neo1> taplar: wait I look now
[17:28:32] <Neo1> I did not understand what that code do
[17:28:50] <Neo1> you maybe want say need only once initialize widget?
[17:28:52] <taplar> $.widget("custom.combobox", { ....
[17:28:59] <taplar> this is defining a new widget in jquery
[17:29:12] <taplar> that you later use how ever many times you need
[17:29:19] <taplar> you only have to do that defining once
[17:29:31] <Neo1> oh, I did know, need to rebuild all
[17:29:32] <taplar> or you *should* only have to do that once
[17:29:45] <Neo1> yes, and function will differ
[17:30:17] <Neo1> I need only call function which will define widget and than use $('selector').combobox();
[17:30:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/x94exjbg/
[17:30:37] <Neo1> taplar: thanks I revise that
[17:32:15] <Neo1> taplar: I watched jquery UI files and couldn't find there 'combobox' function
[17:33:07] <taplar> i'm not entirely sure what ui concept you are calling a combobox
[17:33:27] <taplar> you talking about a dropdown with checkbox selects in it?
[17:33:33] <Neo1> yes
[17:33:40] <Neo1> do you good know jquery UI?
[17:33:59] <Neo1> $.widget("custom.combobox" this row make possible call $().combobox?
[17:34:02] <taplar> not deeply
[17:34:21] <Neo1> just inside creating this widget I got error 'combobox is not define'
[17:34:29] <taplar> looks like it
[17:34:31] <Neo1> defined
[17:34:41] <Neo1> yes maybe
[17:35:02] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/widget/ looks like you use it in that manner
[17:37:12] <MACscr> I need help with  a task im trying to accomplish here: https://jsfiddle.net/vj90s9fb/107/. The most important being the ability to insert text at wherever the caret is in the editor at the time the merge button is pressed. Any suggestions?
[17:37:24] <Neo1> there very big code
[17:37:50] <Neo1> I think after widget began accessible this code $( "#my-widget1" ).colorize();
[17:38:19] <MACscr> ha, nvm. just found a plugin for that. lol
[17:38:21] <Neo1> if call without definition, we god error undefined function.
[17:38:23] <taplar> MACscr: you'd have to keep track of where the cursor is before the click, cause the click is going to remove the focus
[17:39:06] <taplar> Neo1: right, you have to define the widget before you try to use it
[17:39:18] <Neo1> ok, continue doing. Performance at first!!!
[17:39:25] <taplar> but that can be done on it's own outside of that my_combobox, like i showed in the fiddle
[17:39:38] <Neo1> taplar: there much read, jquery ui has big documentation
[17:40:05] <Neo1> taplar: no it' s not useful, better add function which will do definition
[17:40:18] <taplar> you only want to do that once though
[17:40:31] <taplar> so if you do put it in a method, only call that once
[17:40:58] <Neo1> taplar: but if I will not use combobox this will also executing
[17:41:17] <Neo1> or this is nothing bad
[17:41:50] <taplar> personally i'd put it in it's own IIFE like i showed and stick it in it's own js file
[17:42:12] <Neo1> what means IIFE?
[17:42:18] <Neo1> life?
[17:42:22] <taplar> Immediately Invoked Functional Expression
[17:42:44] <taplar> (function(){ ... }()); <--
[17:42:53] <grapheti> or (function() {})();
[17:42:58] <taplar> sure
[17:42:58] <Neo1> but you need always copy that code to file?
[17:42:58] <grapheti> :P
[17:43:14] <taplar> no, you can just include that file on the page
[17:43:17] <taplar> like other js files
[17:43:28] <Neo1> use <script> ?
[17:43:31] <taplar> yep
[17:43:39] <taplar> it just has to appear after your jquery ui include
[17:43:43] <MACscr> taplar well it seems to work fine in this example http://jsfiddle.net/rmDzu/2/, but when i try to add that functionality to my actual code, it doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/vj90s9fb/108/. no error either. hmm
[17:43:47] <Neo1> I know
[17:44:13] <Neo1> but see there in that file will many other functions too. It will a lib
[17:45:10] <jak2000> taplar whois tapout on #css? you?
[17:45:11] <Neo1> I see all jquery plugins consisted from one file
[17:45:13] <taplar> MACscr: that second one is using a WYSIWYG
[17:45:52] <Neo1> taplar: ok, I understood, Soon show little modified version with a few functions...
[17:46:01] <MACscr> taplar no way! i didnt know that.......
[17:46:03] <MACscr> lol
[17:46:41] <taplar> so that plugin may not take what is in the textarea and render it into the wysiwyg if you logically change it
[17:46:57] <taplar> since the display of the wysiwyg is not the textarea itself
[17:47:26] <taplar> comprende?
[17:49:59] <MACscr> yes, i completely understand that, but even if i reference the textarea and inspect the dom, it doest change it there either (even if it wasnt visable within the div that the editor actually uses)
[17:50:39] <jak2000> taplar!
[17:52:39] <taplar> it's going into the else of the insertAtCaret method
[17:52:43] <taplar> *bottom else
[17:54:10] <is_null> hi all, is it possible to do both filter() and find() at the same time ?
[17:54:35] <taplar> is_null: yes?  what do you mean exactly?
[17:57:16] <taplar> MACscr: https://jsfiddle.net/vj90s9fb/109/
[17:58:05] <taplar> i wonder if content editable divs support the selectionStart property though
[17:58:06] <MACscr> taplar nice!
[17:58:34] <taplar> something to play with at least
[17:58:38] <is_null> taplar: it seems when the element is at the root of the document filter() finds it otherwise i need to use find(), but find() doesn't work in the case the element is a root level element, makes any sense ?
[17:59:02] <taplar> filter() is used to operate upon things you've already found
[17:59:09] <taplar> find() is used to find new things
[17:59:34] <taplar> $('.red, .blue').filter('.red')
[17:59:43] <taplar> $('.parent').find('.child')
[18:01:20] <MACscr> taplar actually, that kind of works. If you type anything new after they editor is loaded, then do an insert, it wipes it all because its using the textarea content and not the content of .trumbowgy-editor.
[18:02:37] <MACscr> i adjusted your edit to work with that instead of the textarea. Which works, but puts whatever you insert at the end
[18:02:37] <MACscr> which makes sense
[18:02:44] <taplar> yeah, it's only setting the trum.  ideally i would assume it should grab the cursor selection from the trum, if possible, operate upon the textarea, and then take the result in the textarea and set it on the trum with that ('html', ... ) method
[18:03:33] <taplar> unless the trum plugin has a change event or something you can trigger to make it propagate it's new value to the textarea
[18:04:29] <taplar> i wonder if this will give you the equivalent to the selection start: https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/documentation/#range
[18:08:45] <MACscr> hmm, the placement seems to be the hardest part. insert it into the editor is pretty easy if you simply copy whats there, add the new text and replace
[18:11:47] <swest> Has anyone else come across a bug in Jquery UI autocomplete (combobox) where it doesn't apply the 'required' error correctly (doesn't add the id of the element) and therefore only validates the first combobox?
[18:12:35] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[18:12:52] <randymarsh9> i have kind of a weird question
[18:14:07] <randymarsh9> is there a way to make sure people who do an ajax request to my web service are doing it from my website?
[18:15:13] <taplar> have you tried to do the request from another domain?
[18:15:31] <taplar> because most servers by default restrict cors access
[18:16:57] <taplar> but that only stops ajax requests
[18:17:23] <taplar> if a user writes something to make the request from a server to your website, it's not as easy
[18:17:54] <randymarsh9> taplar: i disabled cors so i could test locally lol
[18:18:11] <taplar> :), w-hell, ;)
[18:18:13] <randymarsh9> ok so if i leave it on i should be set then
[18:18:16] <swest> that should be set on your server using CORS, or depending on the language you can set it on each page but server is usually best
[18:19:20] <randymarsh9> let me put the cors back to enabled or whatever it was and test again
[18:20:12] <randymarsh9> but i guess the answer is thats what cors is for
[18:20:43] <taplar> part of it, yep
[18:20:53] <taplar> but like i said, that just stops ajax
[18:36:28] <taplar> later all
[20:05:52] <randymarsh9> does cors allow ip addresses or do i have to specify a domain name?
[20:14:05] <monokrome> randymarsh9: I'm guessing IP addresses would work, but - like - you won't have proper HTTPS or anything so sounds scary?
[20:16:55] <randymarsh9> monokrome: for now i'm just trying to get it to work - i can setup https later
[20:17:36] <randymarsh9> it throws me an error with an IP so i was wondering if providing a domain name would fix it but sounds like no
[21:23:32] <W0LF> I have a simple CSS opacity > fadeIn on load function that isn't working and no idea why, anyone free to take a look?
[21:37:02] <W0LF> getting a missing syntax on a very short new js snippet, but not sure why - dowellconsulting.com
[21:37:14] <W0LF> trying to implement a very simple fadein, i'm just very new to js
[21:41:21] <grapheti> W0LF, you're missing a parenthesis on the .ready(function()
[21:41:56] <grapheti> at the end*
[21:46:06] <W0LF> grapheti : i'm looking at the file - the whole thing is "$(document).ready(function () { $('.parallax--parallax1').fadeIn(1000); });"
[21:46:33] <grapheti> do you see the errors in the console when you go to the site?
[21:46:35] <W0LF> it looks like if I put another parenthesis it will have one more closing than opening
[21:46:42] <W0LF> yep
[21:47:16] <W0LF> it says after argument list - so could a parenthesis be missing from a different file?
[21:47:41] <grapheti> looks like it's missing from that fadein.js
[21:47:48] <grapheti> needs to close the .ready(
[21:48:24] <grapheti> this is good and closed: $('.parallax--parallax1').on('load', function() { $this.fadeIn() } );
[21:48:39] <grapheti> $(document).ready(function() { }; this isn't
[21:49:01] <grapheti> $(document).ready(function() { }); <-- that's what it needs
[21:49:28] <W0LF> i'm so confused - this is what i'm seeing in the file
[21:49:37] <W0LF> $(document).ready(function () { $('.parallax--parallax1').fadeIn(1000); });
[21:49:53] <W0LF> doesn't that have the last closing parenthesis right after the bracket at the end?
[21:50:12] <grapheti> I don't see that in the console
[21:50:13] <grapheti> weird
[21:50:56] <W0LF> i'm really, really new to js, but that's why i'm wondering if i have an error in an earlier js file... or my libraries file?
[21:51:10] <W0LF> could that do this?
[21:51:18] <grapheti> yes
[21:51:21] <grapheti> very possible
[21:53:00] <grapheti> this is what I see - http://recordit.co/xBaQIHc4Tq
[21:54:57] <W0LF> oh goodness, i had a misnamed file error - i had renamed it in my ftp and then not in notepad, so it wasn't saving the correct fadein.js file
[21:55:07] <W0LF> but now it's saying it's not a function
[21:55:32] <grapheti> $ is not a function usually means you're not loading jquery correctly
[21:55:49] <grapheti> jquery needs to be above scripts you reference it
[21:56:42] <grapheti> Do you use any scripts that are above <script src="../jquery"> ?
[21:56:58] <grapheti> that are jquery
[21:58:33] <W0LF> i'm not sure what you mean - could i post the few js i have in a pastebin to look at?
[21:58:59] <grapheti> Well, I see them
[21:59:41] <W0LF> it sounds like you're asking if i have an errorneous nested js statement in one of the files?
[22:00:20] <W0LF> but i'm not sure what that looks like - i'm only using slightly modified js files i've found elsewhere or were included to be used with a specific module i wanted
[22:01:11] <grapheti> I wonder if you include jquery in the <head> section if it will work
[22:02:06] <W0LF> so like jQuery(function ($) {
[22:02:18] <W0LF> and close with });
[22:02:19] <W0LF> ?
[22:02:20] <grapheti> like
[22:02:22] <grapheti> <script src="/core/assets/vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js?v=2.2.4"></script>
[22:02:36] <grapheti> so that it's <head><script src="/core/assets/vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js?v=2.2.4"></script></head>
[22:03:23] <W0LF> i'm using drupal so i don't think i've set anything explicitly in the head of the site, and i'm not sure how to
[22:03:40] <grapheti> jquery not loading correctly is usually the problem to $ is not a function
[22:04:54] <grapheti> you can try the jQuery(function... tho
[22:04:59] <grapheti> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23720918/drupal-7-typeerror-for-jquery-script-is-not-a-function
[22:08:14] <W0LF> ok i think i understand it's not loading the js file correctly, and i think the snippet itself is correct to fadeIn the opacity element, but - ok let me take a look
[22:08:29] <grapheti> kk
[22:09:48] <W0LF> ok changing the file to
[22:09:49] <W0LF> (function ($) {
[22:09:49] <W0LF> $(document).ready(function () { $('.parallax--parallax1').fadeIn(1000); });
[22:09:49] <W0LF> })(jQuery);
[22:10:04] <W0LF> removed the error, but the element still doesn't show up
[22:13:40] <grapheti> there's some scripts that are 404ing
[22:13:45] <grapheti> if you check the network tab
[22:16:40] <W0LF> ok i see them - how do i track down what's trying to call those? i just looked and there is no dowellconsulting.com/libraries/jquery.localScroll/jquery.localScroll.min.js?own8q7 file
[22:16:48] <W0LF> or containing folder for that matter
[22:17:03] <W0LF> not sure what module i've installed, etc. could be trying to find it
[22:18:56] <grapheti> ah, not idea
[22:21:00] <grapheti> no*
[22:21:31] <W0LF> ok, thanks for the help - gotta do some digging it looks like =]
[22:21:53] <grapheti> yw
[22:23:10] <grapheti> it probably has nothing to do with the element not fading in
[22:25:09] <grapheti> do you want it to fade in on page load?
[22:26:26] <grapheti> W0LF, try this - https://jsfiddle.net/7crvdhkm/
[22:30:44] <grapheti> you just need to change the jquery part and remove opacity on .parallax--parallax1
[22:32:30] <W0LF> back to TypeError: $ is not a function
[22:32:53] <W0LF> trying to disable modules to see if that gets rid of errors or does something...
[22:33:07] <W0LF> you can see how the image jumps at first eh
[22:35:56] <grapheti> wait
[22:36:03] <grapheti> add what you did before
[22:36:21] <grapheti> the jQuery(... or w/e
[22:36:53] <grapheti> keep this: $('.parallax--parallax1').hide().fadeIn(3000);
[22:37:42] <grapheti> add the (function($) {  ...  })(jQuery);
[22:37:45] <grapheti> back
[22:37:57] <grapheti> or w/e it was, not used to writing it that way lol
[22:40:55] <W0LF> ooh, ok now the fade in works! but the image is still shown and jumps around before it's not show
[22:41:03] <W0LF> shown*
[22:41:14] <W0LF> at least on firefox
[22:41:20] <grapheti> does on Chrome too
[22:41:28] <W0LF> yup chrome too
[22:43:13] <grapheti> may try #css
[22:43:18] <grapheti> that seems a more css issue
[22:44:14] <grapheti> W0LF, ^
[22:44:36] <W0LF> aye, i think it's the way setting up the image to work as a parallax - but i was hoping i could get the onload or document.ready thing to hide the image until it was through
[22:45:53] <grapheti> hide the image until it was through?
[22:47:40] <W0LF> hide the image until the page was loaded and the repositioning css was done making it jump around, then fade it in
[22:48:05] <W0LF> is there a way i could add the opacity 0 back in, then change the opacity with that js
[22:48:19] <W0LF> that way it would load transparent and the js could fade it in
[22:48:59] <grapheti> ye let me see
[22:50:54] <W0LF> ahh, it looks like it works in chrome just adding the opacity back in - but not firefox
[22:51:01] <W0LF> maybe it's just a b
[22:51:09] <W0LF> browser cache issue let me see
[22:51:14] <grapheti> kk
[22:51:52] <W0LF> nope, stays transparent on ff...weird
[22:52:25] <grapheti> that is weird
[22:52:33] <grapheti> well, I gotta jet
[22:52:33] <W0LF> oh, and it doesn't work on a new incognito chrome either
[22:52:36] <W0LF> ugh
[22:52:41] <W0LF> ok, thanks for everything!!
[22:52:42] <grapheti> if it's dead in here ##javascript might be able to help
[22:52:49] <W0LF> grapheti++
[22:52:50] <grapheti> yw man :D
[22:52:53] <grapheti> keep up the good work
[22:53:01] <W0LF> yea, def thanks so much
[22:53:05] <grapheti> np
