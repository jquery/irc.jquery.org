[00:00:02] <WickedSik> orl: it does work on the mouseover event
[00:00:09] <orl> WickedSik: oh, really?
[00:00:17] <WickedSik> orl: http://api.jquery.com/live
[00:00:18] <orl> OK, I'm going to check whether that's better.
[00:01:30] <orl> jQuery 1.5.2
[00:01:53] <orl> doesn't this: "As of jQuery 1.4.1 the hover event can be specified (mapping to mouseenter and mouseleave, which, in turn, are mapped to mouseover and mouseout)." mean that mouseenter is OK? (I'm not english speaker)
[00:05:00] <orl> WickedSik: and actually, here is the second script not working, no mouseenter in it, only click: http://pastebin.com/W2vucybm
[00:05:36] <orl> One thing I'm not sure to have understood, should I "kill" (die?) all of this when a new page is loaded?
[00:05:55] <WickedSik> orl: no. new page is clean slate
[00:06:54] <orl> Wickedsick: OK
[00:07:08] <orl> I just saw that event.stopPropagation won't work
[00:07:11] <WickedSik> orl: you can leave the $(document).ready away, btw, it is useless since you're just binding events.
[00:07:12] <orl> could explain a bit.
[00:07:34] <WickedSik> orl: could indeed, because the script itself is nicely done, and seemly fault-free
[00:08:06] <orl> OK (thanks by the way, I wouldn't have used such words!)
[00:09:43] <orl> WickedSik: wonderful: that's it!
[00:09:46] <orl> Thanks a lot!
[00:10:03] <WickedSik> orl:  you're welcome :)
[00:28:13] <nir01> hi guys, how do i implement a link, whe u hover, a image slides down below it. if u out of image and link, it slides up
[00:28:29] <nir01> got similar functionality, but its buggy
[00:28:43] <nir01> mayb there's some ready to use script?
[01:01:53] <NL_Ed> timing: Morning mate, you about?
[01:03:30] <timing> NL_Ed: yeah but i'm busy :-)
[01:03:33] <timing> but fire ahead
[01:03:47] <NL_Ed> timing Can I pastebin it?
[01:03:56] <timing> do the jsfiddle!
[01:04:00] <NL_Ed> ok
[01:05:47] <NL_Ed> is jsfiddle down?
[01:12:26] <WickedSik> fiddle is up, just slow
[01:12:39] <juha_> go fiddle yourself
[01:13:30] <WickedSik> psml
[01:14:35] <NL_Ed> its being soooo slow, are there any alternatives
[01:15:30] <asfasf> #
[01:25:42] <mekwall> hmm... why is there no input prediction like swiftkey but for PC?
[01:25:52] <mekwall> that would be epic
[01:26:29] <WickedSik> mekwall: because you don't have a touch-screen keyboard...
[01:26:42] <mekwall> WickedSik: why would I need that?
[01:26:56] <mekwall> input prediction would still be viable
[01:26:56] <NL_Ed> timing: http://jsfiddle.net/tDvHv/
[01:27:15] <mekwall> that learn from how I build my sentences and predict the next word I am going to type
[01:27:23] <WickedSik> mekwall: input prediction yes, but, surely you don't want to CLICK on the predictions?
[01:27:23] <NL_Ed> timing: It's not working at all as it should on jsfiddle
[01:27:33] <mekwall> WickedSik: tab-completion?
[01:27:49] <mekwall> just how nicks are autocompleted in my irc client
[01:28:20] <WickedSik> mekwall: Tab completion is nice, but I'm talking about the off-chance that the prediction is false
[01:28:42] <mekwall> WickedSik: it will show the word that is being predicted
[01:29:29] <mekwall> WickedSik: it's called type-ahead
[01:29:51] <WickedSik> mekwall: hmm, k, well, I never used SwiftKey, I use Swype
[01:30:12] <mekwall> WickedSik: so did I, but realized that it wasn't viable since I mostly use one hand
[01:30:37] <mekwall> I often text while on the bus/tram and have to use my other hand for balance :)
[01:30:39] <WickedSik> mekwall: ... I won't ask further
[01:30:53] <WickedSik> mekwall: Thanks for the explenation :P
[01:30:56] <mekwall> swype is just too slow and hard to use in such an environment
[01:31:25] <mekwall> it's helluva great app, and is way faster when using both hands in a controlled environment
[01:32:15] <WickedSik> mmhmm, can imagine
[01:32:42] <WickedSik> but well, I have the HTC G2, so I can just type with both hands, leaning against the doorpost :D and be faster than swype and swiftkey :D
[01:33:00] <jorenl_> Hey! I'm loading a flash movie in a div with $('#div').html(), but for some reason (only) chrome converts the &s in the flashvars="" parameter to &amp; . Any ideas?
[01:33:28] <WickedSik> swfobject.
[01:33:31] <WickedSik> Just saying
[01:33:48] <jorenl_> WickedSick: how?
[01:34:18] <mekwall> jorenl_: create a new element with jquery and set flashvars with .attr, then you can just appened it to the div
[01:34:32] <mekwall> that will solve your problem
[01:35:06] <jorenl_> mekwall: ok; so it won't load the movie without flashvars first? (and why does google chrome do that and all other browsers don't)
[01:35:25] <WickedSik> the swfobject library is perfect for adding flash into pages using javascript. google it :)
[01:36:45] <mekwall> jorenl_: I think it's webkit that escapes ampersands when using innerHTML, but I could be wrong :)
[01:37:06] <jorenl_> mekwall: :/ I think it worked in safari
[01:37:35] <mekwall> well then it might be something else... maybe you should file a bug
[01:37:50] <mekwall> jorenl_: however, using .attr will go around that problem
[01:38:21] <jorenl_> So should I use swfobject or .attr? :)
[01:42:03] <mekwall> jorenl_: swfobject will probably give you less headaches :)
[01:42:49] <jorenl_> mekwall: I'll try
[01:50:01] <Godfather_> hi
[01:50:23] <Godfather_> i want to select an option from a select, i tried this http://pastebin.com/K57SCB21 with no result
[01:51:26] <MarcelT3> hey there, how could i wrap a word inside a paragraph with <span>|</span> efficiently?
[01:51:50] <moo-_-> Godfather_: try select element instead of optino
[01:53:05] <Godfather_> moo-_-,  ?
[01:54:15] <moo-_-> Godfather_: maybe you are looking for this http://api.jquery.com/val/
[01:56:17] <Godfather_> moo-_-, "The .val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements"
[01:56:26] <Godfather_> i want to set the value
[01:56:29] <moo-_-> Godfather_: read further down
[01:56:47] <hooloovoo> Godfather_: You can do that as well.
[01:57:05] <hooloovoo> Godfather_: Just pass a string as a argument in val()
[01:57:39] <Godfather_> i see
[01:57:41] <Godfather_> thx!
[01:59:10] <Godfather_> and another question related,                       <select name="tipo" id="tipo"> theres a selector for "name" ?
[01:59:10] <SIDU> 		var open = document.getElementById('menuopen').src.indexOf('open');
[01:59:12] <SIDU> 	parent.document.body.cols = (open==-1 ? '200,*' : '0,*');
[01:59:19] <SIDU> how to rewrite above in jq ?
[01:59:27] <oquidave> hello guys, am trying to make an ajax call using jquery passing get parameters, but am having some trouble...here is my sample code http://pastebin.com/fTqFpVH4
[01:59:36] <SIDU> open|close a frame
[01:59:41] <merlin1991> can it be that the .data method is not chainable?
[01:59:52] <SIDU> coldhead: :)
[02:00:08] <WickedSik> http://api.jquery.com/data
[02:00:11] <WickedSik> there's you answer
[02:00:21] <oquidave> the get parameters are not being passed on properly,
[02:01:29] <senech_a2> hi
[02:01:42] <merlin1991> WickedSik: the docs tell me it's chainable, but my code tells me it's not
[02:02:20] <merlin1991> because if I remove the .data('somekey', somedata) call from the chain it starts to work (besides not having stored the data)
[02:02:53] <Godfather_> its something like  $('input[name=tipo]').val('....'); ?
[02:03:24] <Godfather_> select[name=tipo]
[02:04:22] <WickedSik> merlin1991: Are you using .data('x') or .data('x', 'y')
[02:04:39] <WickedSik> merlin1991: sorry. Just missed the line
[02:05:10] <merlin1991> crap, I take everything back, I was using the wrong identifier, it does ineed work if the y argument is valid
[02:05:26] <WickedSik> merlin1991: hurray ^^
[02:07:56] <zoggy> hmm anyone here do chrome extensions using jquery/jquery ui ?
[02:08:19] <zoggy> looking for a good template/base extension to use so i dont have to just start from scratch
[02:09:31] <SIDU> is there a way to toggle:
[02:09:33] <SIDU> 		src=$(this).attr('src');
[02:09:35] <SIDU> 		if (src=='img/menuopen.png'){
[02:09:36] <SIDU> 			$(this).attr('src','img/menuclose.png');
[02:09:38] <SIDU> 		}else{
[02:09:39] <SIDU> 			$(this).attr('src','img/menuopen.png');
[02:09:41] <SIDU> 		}
[02:10:59] <SIDU> coldhead: help :D
[02:11:12] <WickedSik> SIDU: unless.... you want to use .filter() you can't
[02:12:28] <SIDU> otherwise i have to make 2 class then.
[02:12:37] <SIDU> toggleClass will work
[02:13:26] <SIDU> WickedSik: howto re-write this in jq ?
[02:13:28] <SIDU> 	parent.document.body.cols = (open==-1 ? '200,*' : '0,*');
[02:14:08] <SIDU> well. js works. but i try to make pure jq :)
[02:15:06] <WickedSik> SIDU: No you don't :P
[02:15:19] <WickedSik> seriously though, it's ill-advised
[02:15:33] <SIDU> ok no worries.
[02:22:42] <ravenzz> MarcelT3 http://www.webdevout.net/test?01S
[02:26:04] <bjhaid> how do i set a time on a toggle, say i want a div tag to toggle for just say 5 seconds
[02:26:41] <ravenzz> ?toggle @ bjhaid
[02:26:41] <bot-t> bjhaid, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[02:26:47] <WickedSik> bjhaid: setTimeout? Or do you mean something different?
[02:26:48] <ravenzz> .toggle( [duration], [easing], [callback] )
[02:29:27] <Woet> anyone know how I can get the .hide('slide') effect to start from the right of the banner instead of ~ 100 pixels to the left of it? https://www.snelserver.com/?sennehosadamsinyav
[02:30:07] <bjhaid> ravenzz: callback, would the element i would want to replace it with?
[02:31:13] <ravenzz> bjhaid did you read the doc?
[02:32:10] <bjhaid> ravenzz: yes, just looking at it, in what unit is the duration measured?
[02:32:24] <bjhaid> and what values does easing take?
[02:32:49] <ravenzz> milliseconds
[02:33:14] <ravenzz> all of those parameters are optional
[02:33:29] <amit_usual> isn't there a easy way to encode get parameters into the url where the params could be a dictionary or array
[02:33:38] <ravenzz> then you can omit that if you don't need an effect
[02:34:48] <bjhaid> ravenzz: what if i just want to toggle, and replace with the original element, all of that responding to just a single click
[02:35:51] <ravenzz> ?demo
[02:35:51] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:36:02] <ravenzz> replace what?
[02:43:30] <jorenl_> mekwall: I think swfobject.js is overkill. How would I do it the .attr way?
[02:44:20] <hugolp> hi, can anyone recommend me a jquery (or javascript) spinbox?
[02:46:27] <NoNoNo> hugolp: jQuery UI has one. Don't like jQuery UI though
[02:47:25] <hugolp> NoNoNo: can you give me the link, because I have been checking jQuery UI and I have missed it. Also, what alternatives to jQuery UI do you like?
[02:51:00] <aroman> hey, is there an event handler for when radiobuttons or checkboxes are changed?
[02:51:09] <NoNoNo> hugolp: hmm, can't find it - gone? Have no alternatives, sorry
[02:58:29] <TeddyMurray> $('#create_client_form[name="client"]').change(function() { console.log('test') }); -- is my selector properly formatted?
[02:58:57] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: you can drop de double-quotes, but overall it's fine.
[02:59:06] <TeddyMurray> awesome, thanks
[02:59:56] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: if you want to select everything with the name "client" you need to add a space before [
[03:00:10] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: within form #create_client_form ofcourse
[03:00:13] <TeddyMurray> ahhh
[03:00:19] <TeddyMurray> that's what i was missing
[03:00:52] <Cork> WickedSik: its actaully a good practis to use the quotes around the values, cause ex if you have client[] names or similar
[03:01:02] <TeddyMurray> worked!
[03:01:27] <WickedSik> Cork: I agree, but I said "can" not "should" or "must"
[03:01:33] * Cork nods
[03:01:52] * TeddyMurray nods
[03:16:25] * WickedSik pats heads of Cork and TeddyMurray
[03:18:19] <Godfather_> i have a little question hard to explain for me... i try: i'm reading with ajax the options(values) in a mysql database of a <select>, i do it on window.onload. Ok, the  values (<option>VALUE1</option> .. )are read fine and inserted on the select
[03:19:23] <Godfather_> but at the same time i do $(document).ready(function (){ and here i set an especific value into the select select[name=example]').val('a value');
[03:19:51] <Godfather_> the problem is that there is a delay after window.onload returns the values of the mysql
[03:20:11] <Godfather_> and $(document).ready tries to put a value that at the moment doesnt exist
[03:20:21] <Godfather_> cause the query hasnt executed yet...
[03:20:42] <WickedSik> Godfather_: you can use $.ajax({ success: function( data ) {} })
[03:20:46] <Godfather_> i want to know if theres a posibility to do instead $(document).ready
[03:21:08] <TeddyMurray> $('#create_client_form [name="client"]:selected') --- how would i do the selected option?
[03:21:09] <WickedSik> Godfather_: Set the value in the handler of the ajax-function
[03:21:17] <TeddyMurray> this returns undefined
[03:21:21] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: space?
[03:21:24] <TeddyMurray> lol :)
[03:21:32] <TeddyMurray> ty
[03:21:38] <Godfather_> WickedSik, i will have a look at it
[03:23:42] <shomon> how do I stop people from entering a zero in an input box?
[03:24:25] <WickedSik> shomon: onkeypress : check whether the pressed key is a "0" , if so, return false
[03:25:08] <shomon> okay thanks... Hmm maybe onchange or something, so they can still write fractions
[03:26:22] <WickedSik> shomon: onchange fires when the field loses focus, are you sure you want to do that?
[03:26:28] <formers> can anyone recomend a good ui widget library other than (jquery ui, jquery tools, wijmo) ?
[03:27:21] <bjhaid> can i close a dialog box after a particular time say 10 seconds?
[03:27:46] <shomon> well, if they started to type 0.8 for example, woudln't onkeypress stop them?
[03:28:08] <WickedSik> shomon: you could check for the existence of a " . " in the value
[03:28:24] <WickedSik> shomon: but, what do you want to accomplish?
[03:28:43] <shomon> it's 2 fields that let you type in weight and height, and then calculates BMI
[03:28:44] <WickedSik> shomon: $(field).val() !== '0' ?
[03:28:50] <shomon> I don't want infinity or NaN as a result
[03:29:22] <WickedSik> I'd say, check the value onblur, and "destroy" it if it's "0"
[03:29:37] <formers> bjhaid : look up .delay()
[03:29:47] <shomon> cool, sounds great, thanks WickedSik
[03:34:13] <TeddyMurray> anyone here familiar with parseXML?
[03:34:16] <TeddyMurray> var xmlDoc = $.parseXML( response ); $xml = $( xmlDoc ); $name = $xml.find( "name" ); console.log( $name.text() );
[03:34:26] <TeddyMurray> is showing blank, however im pretty sure my xml is formatted correctly
[03:35:28] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: what does $name.textContent give?
[03:36:10] <TeddyMurray> hmm, just did console.debug($name); -- doesnt seem to be filled
[03:36:15] <TeddyMurray> maybe my xml isn't formatted properly
[03:36:38] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: console.info($xml) what does that give? An xml document?
[03:37:22] <TeddyMurray> hmm nope lol, says document is empty
[03:37:24] <TeddyMurray> looking into it
[03:38:51] <TeddyMurray> ah ha
[03:38:56] <TeddyMurray> xml not formatted properly
[03:43:56] <bjhaid> formers: i would paste my code now so you can have a look, not getting it to work

[03:56:04] <Carlos_mind> the load without page refresh?
[03:56:05] <Carlos_mind> the load without page refresh?
[03:56:22] <Maltray> Wassup guys, im trying to find the last element on a div, all the elements on that div are of the same class, i just care about the last one, is there a easy way to do it?, i've tried with for, no luck tho.
[03:56:27] * mocas is back from holidays....
[03:56:37] <Maltray> wb :)
[03:57:36] <vidarw> Maltray: http://api.jquery.com/last/?
[03:57:54] <Maltray> u gotta be kidding me..
[03:58:09] <Maltray> aw.. ew.. w/e, thanks vidarw!
[03:58:15] <Carlos_mind> the load without page refresh?
[03:58:35] <Maltray> i've been fighting with this for like 30 mins already
[04:00:08] <Maltray> im saved!!!!!!!!!!! thanks!!!
[04:00:16] <Carlos_mind> the load without page refresh?
[04:01:37] <Maltray> huh, u mean ajax?
[04:01:59] <Maltray> Carlos_mind u mean how to use ajax? ._.
[04:03:13] <Carlos_mind> request does not work with php
[04:05:46] <Maltray> huh..
[04:06:26] <WickedSik> Carlos_mind: an idea, try asking a well formulated question.\
[04:06:28] <Maltray> one more question, is there a way, to do like when u click an A element, and u do like: $('a').live('click',function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[04:06:48] <WickedSik> Maltray: it should be sufficient to return false, but what do you want to accomplish?
[04:06:59] <Maltray> im sry for writing this in 2 lines, that enter slipt away, following my question: to do the same, with a checkbox?
[04:07:18] <Maltray> sry WickedSik, my question was like cutted down :p
[04:07:43] <WickedSik> Maltray: no problem, but I think return false would do what you want. If what you want is cancel the selection
[04:07:46] <Maltray> I mean, like, prevent the checkbox from beeing checked, like we prevent the a to get to an URL
[04:08:44] <Maltray> alright, yes, ur right, im using right now the .live('change', function.., so i should be using 'click'
[04:08:49] <Maltray> thanks wicked, im gonna try it right now
[04:10:13] <Maltray> ur cool man, thanks :)
[04:11:44] <WickedSik> Maltray: you're welcome :)

[04:32:03] <xxtjaxx> Hi! I wanted to replace the content of a div on my site using jquery. I wanted to use a click event to run an ajax get request. I wrote something like this: http://pastebin.com/0pcDkheQ It appears not to work. So any critique()?
[04:37:57] <shomon> can I get the datepicker to default to the first of the month when it comes up?

[04:40:25] <seutje> anything else u need googled?
[04:42:07] <merlin1991> is it safe to assign click handlers to single fields in a table row when the row itself has a clickhandler too, or will that even work?

[04:49:00] <gnarf> see ?.load( url )
[04:49:01] <bot-t> gnarf, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:49:07] <Whirl3d> So, load is better than .ajax in this context, huh?
[04:49:17] <gnarf> "Loading Page Fragments"
[04:49:36] <gnarf> if you were .ajaxing, you can just $( data ).find( selector ).appendTo( element )
[04:50:16] <Whirl3d> gnarf, thanks for the help. That's what I thought, but I can't seem to get a result unless I append the $(data) to the dom
[04:50:31] <Whirl3d> once I append it to the dom, I can use find with no problems
[04:50:53] <gnarf> Whirl3d: what is the selector?
[04:51:22] <Whirl3d> Basically, I have the navmenu repeated on all my "pages" so that if javascript is disabled, it'll still work.
[04:51:51] <gnarf> what is the "selector" ?
[04:51:53] <Whirl3d> when I load the content via ajax (js enabled obviously), I don't want to reload the menu portion. So I have my content in a div called .pageHolder'
[04:52:22] <gnarf> there should be no reason that wouldn't work with $( data ).find( ".pageHolder")
[04:52:30] <Whirl3d> $(data).find(".pageHolder") doesn't work, but $(data).appendTo($("#temp")).find(".pageHolder") does
[04:52:33] <gnarf> you're saying that doesn't return you an element?
[04:53:22] <Whirl3d> $(data).find(".pageHolder").appendTo(page) doesn't append anything
[04:53:27] <Whirl3d> in the success handler
[04:54:58] <Whirl3d> And what about styles and scripts that are loaded in the head of the ajax content? I used to cycle throught the text, extract the scripts URLs and the styles and then one day realized that jquery does it automatically somehow
[04:55:09] <xxtjaxx> merlin1991: Oh sorry.
[04:55:10] <bjhaid> hi, i put this line in my code, and the dialog box, does not delay for the specified time before it closes, $(this).append('<p>"wait for some seconds"</p>').delay(10000).dialog('close');
[04:55:14] <xxtjaxx> merlin1991: hold on
[04:55:18] <bjhaid> any reason why?
[04:55:29] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, delay only works for animations
[04:55:43] <xxtjaxx> merlin1991: http://pastebin.com/cvJv8CkV
[04:55:45] <bjhaid> blackspotiwiggins: so how do i delay there?
[04:55:52] <gnarf> Whirl3d: have you tried .filter instead of .find?
[04:55:55] <blackspotwiggins> settimeout?
[04:56:15] <Whirl3d> gnarf, lemme try that. Thanks for the input. I'll report back.
[04:56:30] <xxtjaxx> merlin1991: damn... this pastebin sucks a dead dogs cock.
[04:56:38] <gnarf> Whirl3d: if the <div> is a direct decedant of <body> it will show up as a "top level" part of $( data )
[04:56:43] <gnarf> so find wont find it
[04:56:58] <xxtjaxx> merlin1991: http://paste.debian.net/126589/ <<< critique away..
[04:57:10] <Whirl3d> oh, that explains a lot.
[04:57:18] <shomon> seutje thanks for that
[04:57:24] <gnarf> xxtjaxx: DRY
[04:57:35] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: hum?
[04:57:52] <gnarf> xxtjaxx: you have the same exact function duplicated 3 times - Don't Repeat Yourself
[04:58:22] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: yeah but they are for different ids.
[04:58:31] <gnarf> xxtjaxx: not the click handler
[04:58:35] <merlin1991> you could do it generic though
[04:58:43] <gnarf> xxtjaxx: the ajax callback
[04:58:45] <gnarf> same function 3 times
[04:59:00] <gnarf> fix that obvious one first
[04:59:08] <gnarf> then we can move on to abstracting the get
[04:59:08] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: they are only placeholders for now since not everything of the content is inthere.
[04:59:11] <xxtjaxx> yet.
[04:59:53] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: later there should be /quali?nolayout=true  and queries to other content etc.
[05:01:18] <TeddyMurray> hi, im having trouble using parseXML with post, could someone help me?
[05:01:27] <TeddyMurray> its saying the document is empty
[05:01:49] <gnarf> xxtjaxx: doesn't mean http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/p8Vyz/ isn't a valid critique
[05:02:12] <gnarf> are those #work, #fun and #quali <a> tags ?
[05:04:17] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: yes
[05:04:27] <gnarf> and are their hrefs mostly correct?
[05:05:49] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: But if I'd do hrefs to those the content would be gotten and switched to that page instead of ajax get and replace right?
[05:06:04] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/p8Vyz/1/
[05:06:21] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: Hey, I was out for a moment
[05:06:28] <gnarf> make the href go to the page without the replace param
[05:06:34] <gnarf> so non-js'ers still go to the right spot
[05:06:36] <WickedSik> what's the issue with the XML?
[05:06:36] <TeddyMurray> hey WickedSik np, i decided to just use each() instead of using the parseXML
[05:06:46] <TeddyMurray> didn't figure it out D:
[05:06:47] <gnarf> like you know - google
[05:06:55] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: What's the XML?
[05:07:03] <bjhaid> please why does this line not execute?  setTimeout(function(){ $this.dialog('close'),300});
[05:07:04] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/hjiSsv7M
[05:07:08] <gnarf> add the replace param to the query string with the "data" argument to ajax
[05:07:28] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/p8Vyz/2/
[05:07:31] <siovene> Hello. It seems like calling .width() on an element I just created always gives me 0px. Does this have something to do with the fact that it hasn't been drawn yet? How can I get the width otherwise?
[05:08:01] <Whirl3d> gnarf, you rock. Thanks for explaining about divs on the top level, I wrapped them in a div and the rest works perfectly. Thanks again
[05:08:15] <gnarf> better yet would be to add a class to each of those <a>'s or use something like #navmenu li a
[05:08:16] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: all the CDATA is not really required, but besides that the XML seems fine...
[05:08:27] <TeddyMurray> yeah, its strange
[05:08:41] <TeddyMurray> i think it had to do with using post and parseXML
[05:08:43] <gnarf> Whirl3d: np, its not something you think about often ;)
[05:08:56] <TeddyMurray> i added the dataType: xml later, but that didn't work either
[05:08:59] <gnarf> Whirl3d: i didn't think about it until i tried to write a fiddle to test it for you
[05:09:05] <Cork> siovene: you need to append the element to the dom for width to work, other then that is should be correct
[05:09:14] <gnarf> Whirl3d: then i relized that $( data ) was throwing out the <html> and <body> tags
[05:09:16] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: Did you check the xhr.responseXML ?
[05:09:28] <TeddyMurray> nope, what is that?
[05:10:07] <WickedSik> TeddyMurray: an XHTTPRequest has 2 responses, responseText and responseXML, the latter is filled when the browser detects an application/xml file
[05:10:40] <WickedSik> are you sending the data with an xml - content-type?
[05:12:03] <TeddyMurray> ohh XD
[05:12:10] <TeddyMurray> yeah
[05:12:12] <TeddyMurray> i am
[05:12:20] <TeddyMurray> header("Content-type: text/xml;charset=utf-8");
[05:12:45] <WickedSik> I believe the correct content-type is application/xml, but I don't think it should matter
[05:13:02] <TeddyMurray> ah, you're right, i have an if statement
[05:13:15] <TeddyMurray> if ( stristr($_SERVER["HTTP_ACCEPT"],"application/xhtml+xml") ) {header("Content-type: application/xhtml+xml;charset=utf-8"); } else {header("Content-type: text/xml;charset=utf-8");}
[05:13:15] <TeddyMurray> 		
[05:13:21] <TeddyMurray> sorry for the php in #jquery
[05:13:21] <TeddyMurray> lol
[05:13:55] <WickedSik> why the XHtml?
[05:14:20] <TeddyMurray> not sure, that part was copied from other code
[05:14:31] <WickedSik> remove the xhtml, leave the xml
[05:15:00] <TeddyMurray> well, ive solved the problem using each() instead treating the document as text
[05:15:18] <WickedSik> Ok :) you could obviously also use JSON.
[05:15:32] <TeddyMurray> what are the benefits?
[05:16:18] <WickedSik> smaller reply, directly importable in jquery
[05:16:24] <TeddyMurray> ahh
[05:16:25] <TeddyMurray> awesome
[05:17:08] <WickedSik> assert( JSON.parse('{"teddy":"awesome"}').teddy === 'awesome' ) :P
[05:18:07] <amit_usual> TeddyMurray : are you doing ajax post , do you have any idea/piece of code about how to do a cross domain  jsonp post
[05:18:29] <TeddyMurray> haha
[05:18:31] <gnarf> you can't cross domain post ajax
[05:18:53] <xxtjaxx> gnarf: it still changes the page and doesnt just pull the content in :/
[05:18:55] <gnarf> especially not jsonp
[05:19:02] <TeddyMurray> gnarf, why not?
[05:19:07] <gnarf> ?sop
[05:19:07] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[05:19:16] <WickedSik> gnarf... isn't jsonp ESPECIALLY for XSS?
[05:19:17] <gnarf> you can't cross-domain ajax
[05:19:38] <TeddyMurray> gnarf, so i can't do $.post('google.com'); ?
[05:19:38] <gnarf> WickedSik: you can't POST a jsonp request
[05:19:48] <gnarf> TeddyMurray: nope
[05:19:52] <TeddyMurray> interesting, i didn't know that
[05:19:53] <WickedSik> gnarf: true. you can get a jsonp though.
[05:20:10] <gnarf> WickedSik: of course, but he specified "post"
[05:20:36] <WickedSik> gnarf: you are right, I missed that specification.
[05:21:13] <TeddyMurray> ah i see, just tested, thanks for the info gnarf
[05:21:31] <TeddyMurray> "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://google.com/. Origin http://127.0.0.1:8087 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[05:21:32] <TeddyMurray> ;D
[05:21:50] <amit_usual> ok
[05:23:43] <amit_usual> TeddyMurray : i have a similar problem apparently the browser preflights these requests  and i get a method not allowed error :(
[05:24:11] <JKarsrud> Have anyone heard of a problem with height() in IE8 where it doesn't set the right height?
[05:24:39] <JKarsrud> Or get it right?
[05:24:54] <TeddyMurray> amit_usual, can you try get?
[05:25:04] <TeddyMurray> or, i dunno, gnarf, does get not work also?
[05:25:23] <larsemil> i do $.getJSON("../order.json", function (data) { console.log(data)}); and i get Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. I thought i would not get this problem when doing getJson localy ?
[05:25:29] <blackspotwiggins> TeddyMurray, SOP works for everything
[05:25:35] <blackspotwiggins> jsonp allows get
[05:25:37] <blackspotwiggins> that's it
[05:25:41] <gnarf> you can't POST a jsonp - period - everything else is restricted by SOP
[05:26:40] <gnarf> larsemil: by "locally" i hope you aren't using a file:/// url
[05:26:45] <gnarf> you need a web server
[05:27:03] <larsemil> gnarf: i just read that as well. thanks
[05:27:06] <amit_usual> TeddyMurray: no the api of the server does not allow get
[05:27:21] <TeddyMurray> amit_usual, i have an idea
[05:27:40] <TeddyMurray> use curl in php on your server and make it a proxy for your post request
[05:27:40] <gnarf> amit_usual: then you have to write code on your local server that proxies the request to the remote server, or use something like yahoo pipes
[05:27:44] <TeddyMurray> ^^^
[05:27:45] <TeddyMurray> :D
[05:27:48] <TeddyMurray> great minds think alike
[05:28:31] <amit_usual> yahoo pipes could be a solution .. i can't run  local server :(
[05:29:01] <amit_usual> does yahoo pipes allow post requests ?
[05:29:20] <TeddyMurray> amit_usual, by local server he meant your web server
[05:29:58] <amit_usual> TeddyMurray : hmm i know
[05:31:41] <TeddyMurray> oh, you don't have access on this server? XD
[05:31:43] <TeddyMurray> lol
[05:31:46] <siovene> Cork: thanks.
[05:31:47] <bricker> This isn't working as expected (i.e. nothing happens), is there something wrong in this code? http://pastie.org/2391036
[05:32:23] <bricker> just trying to set the next field with class "start_date" to the same value as the one that was just blurred
[05:33:00] <amit_usual> bricker http://jsfiddle.net/  may be better , so that we can see bit of your html
[05:33:31] <bricker> amit_usual: right, I always forget that you guys prefer that here
[05:35:24] <bricker> oh actually this may have just been a brain malfunction
[05:36:41] <bricker> guess not, one sec...
[05:36:48] <amit_usual> bricker : check start_date is id or class
[05:37:14] <amit_usual> bricker : always happens with me :P
[05:37:44] <bricker> it is, however there are three classes thereâ€¦ I'm adding it to js fiddle right now
[05:38:55] <opius> gnarf, are you here?
[05:39:27] <gnarf> ?ask @opius
[05:39:27] <bot-t> opius, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:39:36] <bricker>  http://jsfiddle.net/XpZQu/1/ on blur of the first first, nothing happens. No errors.
[05:40:31] <gnarf> bricker: .next() only looks at immediate siblings
[05:40:35] <gnarf> and actually
[05:40:40] <gnarf> only looks at the NEXT node
[05:40:46] <gnarf> which in this case is a span
[05:41:25] <opius> gnarf, i'm trying to debug my code using chrome, but im not sure what to look for. http://jsfiddle.net/6uxQc/
[05:41:26] <bricker> gnarf: Got it. Which function should I use here?
[05:41:39] <gnarf> bricker: is the .end_date the only one in the parent ul?
[05:42:01] <opius> what i did find is that there seems to be some linebreaks in the returned string
[05:42:14] <gnarf> if not, you've painted yourself into a sticky corner to get out of bricker
[05:42:27] <bricker> gnarf: in this case it is, but I would like to leave flexibility in case, down the line, I decided to add more fields like it
[05:42:55] <gnarf> bricker: well, .closest("ul").find(".end_date") for now
[05:43:11] <gnarf> but you could also tie them together with ids
[05:43:41] <gnarf> best way to do it would be something like this:
[05:43:47] <bricker> gnarf: okay. I will do the find method for now, I guess it won't be too hard to add in the IDs if I need to later. Thank you!
[05:43:53] <bricker> oh, okay
[05:44:03] <bricker> *standing by*
[05:44:12] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/XpZQu/1/
[05:44:24] <gnarf> i.e. store a ref to the other input
[05:44:28] <gnarf> rather than seek it out every time
[05:45:10] <gnarf> also "this.value" is safe in the case of an <input type="text"> --- much faster than $(this).val()
[05:45:18] <bricker> gnarf: looks the same to me, maybe you forgot to update it?
[05:45:31] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/XpZQu/2/
[05:45:36] <gnarf> nope forgot to copy the new link
[05:45:37] <gnarf> :)
[05:46:15] <bricker> gnarf: I see now, I like it. Thanks for the help!
[05:46:19] <Whirl3d> if I have a div with the class "pageHolder loaded active", I should be able to select it using $(".pageHolder").filter(".active")  right?
[05:46:35] <gnarf> ".pageholder.active" also
[05:46:49] <gnarf> but yes
[05:46:54] <Whirl3d> hrmmm, thanks. Must be something else then.
[05:47:13] <gnarf> if you already had $(".pageHolder") calling .filter(".active") should filter to only .pageHolder.active
[05:47:57] <Whirl3d> so the loaded class in the middle doesn't affect it, right?
[05:50:17] <seutje> I love these sales guys... "how long would it take you to develop a game in JS?"
[05:50:48] <seutje> not vague at all, right?
[05:51:43] <WickedSik> seutje: give them a copy of snake? in JS?
[05:51:54] <WickedSik> seutje: or Sudoku :D
[05:52:21] <opius> is this correct syntax? console.log($("#loadTest").text());
[05:52:26] <Whirl3d> as long as a piece of string
[05:52:33] <seutje> opius: sure
[05:52:48] <bricker> gnarf: slick, works great, thank you very much for the help
[05:53:00] <seutje> opius: assuming there's a console object available
[05:53:09] <opius> yeah there is
[05:53:14] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, create a page with one button, that alerts you win
[05:53:19] <blackspotwiggins> bill millions
[05:53:24] <opius> but it returns nothing to the log
[05:53:25] <seutje> lol
[05:53:26] <opius> damnit
[05:53:52] <seutje> I told him "based on the information provided, I'm inclined to estimate it at 9001 years"
[05:54:05] <Aamir> Best way of doing this: $('form').find('*').wrapAll('<div id="wrapper"></div>');
[05:54:33] <misterm> opius: try logging $("#loadtest") or $("#loadtest").length
[05:54:44] <opius> ok
[05:56:49] <opius> yeah, seems that my callback on the load never gets called
[05:57:56] <opius> silly me, i forgot to add () after the function name
[05:58:03] <opius> now i atleast got an error
[05:58:31] <gnarf> opius: are you passing the function?
[05:58:35] <gnarf> cuz if so, you don't want the ()
[05:58:46] <seutje> Aamir: ouch :x
[05:59:07] <gnarf> Aamir: by not doing it?
[05:59:11] <seutje> Aamir: u just trying to get a single inner wrapper to hold everything in the form?
[05:59:19] <Aamir> seutje:  it is but  .find('*') :/
[05:59:27] <Aamir> seutje: yes
[05:59:31] <seutje> children?
[05:59:34] <Aamir> and than unwrap to remove form
[05:59:43] <seutje> $('form').children().wrapAll() ?
[05:59:52] <gnarf> Aamir: var form = $("form"); $("<div id='wrapper'>").append(form.children()).appendTo(form);
[05:59:55] <Aamir> children is better than .find('*') in this case?
[06:00:07] <seutje> I believe so
[06:00:36] <Aamir> Thanks, gnarf & seutje  let me try these..
[06:00:45] <gnarf> .children() helps either way
[06:00:58] <Aamir> humm
[06:01:00] <seutje> ?source wrapall
[06:01:01] <bot-t> Line#5048 - "wrapAll: function( html ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5048
[06:01:15] <seutje> FFFUUU-
[06:01:17] <gnarf> too bad those links don't work anymore
[06:01:20] <seutje> yea :(
[06:01:24] <opius> $("#loadTest").load('get.aspx?userId=' + $('#<%= FindControl("hiddenId").ClientID %>').val(), loadBoxes);     then i have the function declared as var loadBoxes=function() {}
[06:01:42] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L51 @sue
[06:01:45] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L51 @seutje
[06:01:47] <gnarf> :)
[06:02:03] <misterm> opius: that
[06:02:10] <seutje> gnarf: just ctrl+f'ed http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[06:02:22] <gnarf> seutje: that works too
[06:02:23] <misterm> opius: 's a littly gnarly, I would prob pull out the string
[06:02:35] <timing> instead of doing parent().parent().parent() is there a shortcut like parent(3) ?
[06:02:44] <gnarf> timing: what are you looking for?
[06:02:53] <gnarf> because using .closest( selector ) is prolly better
[06:02:58] <seutje> use a class or something
[06:03:02] <seutje> yea, what gnarf said
[06:03:05] <opius> misterm, sorry im a beginner. can you please explain? :)
[06:03:07] <seutje> u don't want such tight coupling
[06:03:13] <gnarf> but, .parents().eq(2)
[06:03:56] <seutje> like <div class="outer"><div class="inner"><div class="most-inner"><span /></div></div></div> $('span').closest('.outer') instead of $('span').parent().parent().parent();
[06:04:19] <seutje> gnarf: that reliable?
[06:04:22] <seutje> feels so fragile
[06:05:02] <gnarf> seutje: looking up your parent chain is prolly never a smart idea
[06:05:09] <gnarf> but its no reason not to teach him 2 new functions
[06:05:11] <gnarf> :)
[06:05:15] <timing> Grega: three parents up
[06:05:19] <gnarf> *without a selector
[06:05:20] <timing> gnarf: three parents up
[06:05:28] <timing> k thanks
[06:05:33] <gnarf> timing: 3 parents up is a "bad idea"
[06:05:43] <timing> why?
[06:05:49] <seutje> true, but I want him to know it's not a good idea and is very prone to breaking (as in, silently failing)
[06:05:53] <gnarf> timing: looking for the .closest("div.container") is
[06:06:08] <seutje> timing: coz the slightest change in markup will make it break
[06:06:15] <seutje> and not "OMG ERROR" kind of breaking
[06:06:17] <timing> that's true
[06:06:21] <timing> haha
[06:06:24] <seutje> but the "lalala, everything is fine" kind of breaking
[06:06:31] <gnarf> seutje: in the binding events / manipulating the wrong element kind too :)
[06:06:40] <timing> sounds reasonable
[06:07:05] <gnarf> at least with .closest() when you change your HTML later, it will just return nothing if nothing matches that selector anymore
[06:08:16] <seutje> oh yea
[06:08:21] <seutje> I've had some fun encounters with that
[06:08:25] <timing> but with three times parent() it's the same, however when I add another parent in the middle
[06:08:38] <misterm> opius: I mean the code is a little dense, I would do something like var url = ... on one line and then $().load( url, ..); on the next
[06:09:12] <seutje> opius: ppl generally don't like it when multiple languages are used in a single line
[06:10:21] <timing> guys, is there a templating engine for php AND js?
[06:10:39] <timing> so you can either use the templating html with a php array or a js object
[06:10:45] <seutje> is there even a templating engine for PHP to begin with?
[06:10:53] <timing> smarty ?
[06:11:05] <timing> both using the same syntax etc
[06:11:28] <blackspotwiggins> timing, how would that work
[06:11:43] <seutje> they can call it a templating engine, but I don't
[06:12:03] <timing> seutje: what is your definition of a template engine? I never looked into it that much
[06:13:56] <seutje> smarty forces u to use PHP in between the html
[06:15:40] <seutje> the php templating engines I've seen that don't force u to use php in the template, eat large chunks of memory and do all sorts of nasty regex shizzle
[06:15:40] <timing> blackspotwiggins: e.g. I have this template in php: $html = '<h3>{title}</h3><p>{content}</p>'; then in php I can do superTemplate($html, array('title' => 'Hi', 'content' => 'Bye')); Then we have the ugly part: <script> var html = '<?php echo $html ?>'; superTemplate(html, {title: 'Hi 2', content: 'Bye 2'}); </script>
[06:16:22] <blackspotwiggins> seems redundant
[06:16:33] <timing> why?
[06:16:44] <seutje> usually templates in js work different, as in u set an ID on a script tag to identify if, and that script tag doesn't contain anything other than the template
[06:16:47] <timing> let me esplain a situation I might use it
[06:16:52] <blackspotwiggins> if you have to output html to js in such ugly way anyway
[06:16:56] <timing> seutje: yeah I use that now
[06:17:06] <blackspotwiggins> might as well render the correct output straight away
[06:17:26] <seutje> that's crazy talk, who'd want a fully populated page onload?
[06:17:27] <blackspotwiggins> doing shit like var html = <%php wtf?! %> is super bad IMO
[06:17:28] <timing> yeah but a part of the output is rendered later
[06:17:51] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: agreed, especially since <% is ASP :P
[06:17:56] <timing> hahaha
[06:17:58] <blackspotwiggins> wtf ever
[06:18:05] <seutje> just being a dick, bro <3
[06:18:23] <seutje> our backenders do that shit all the time, pisses me off
[06:18:34] <timing> ok so if var html = '<?php echo ?>' is bad, how do I pass a var to js?
[06:18:40] <seutje> coz they just dump the shit inline somewhere, assuming to already have access to jQuery and stuff
[06:18:45] <timing> I put a lot in elements, but not everything
[06:18:56] <aka-> timing: hit em with that JSON
[06:18:57] <seutje> ?g php json
[06:18:59] <bot-t> seutje, PHP: JSON - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php
[06:19:11] <aka-> hit with that hot JSON type shit
[06:19:15] <timing> yeah ofcourse
[06:19:16] <blackspotwiggins> timing, you dont, directly
[06:19:21] <blackspotwiggins> @how to pass
[06:19:32] <timing> so you do var html = <?php echo json_encode('Hi') ?>
[06:19:39] <seutje> lol
[06:19:43] <WickedSik> ...
[06:19:44] <timing> hehehe
[06:20:03] <blackspotwiggins> woosh
[06:20:14] <timing> double woosh
[06:20:31] <timing> but let me explain my issue
[06:20:35] <timing> let's say I have a list
[06:20:39] <DerStoffel> 'lo guys
[06:20:48] <WickedSik> 'lo DerStoffel
[06:21:01] <timing> I render a list of 5 items with html: <ul><li/></ul> etc..
[06:21:02] <WickedSik> timing: go on
[06:21:08] <timing> then later the user can add more items to the list
[06:21:22] <timing> the newly created items are html as well
[06:21:46] <timing> I can just append('<li class="">'+lala+'</li>'); and build the whole html again here
[06:21:50] <DerStoffel> i have a question. I am using 4 input fields, adding datepickers and timepickers to them
[06:21:51] <DerStoffel> http://pastebin.com/BkYAV7Qq
[06:21:54] <DerStoffel> selectors are working
[06:21:55] <timing> but I can also use the same 'templat' two times
[06:22:04] <DerStoffel> or using EITHER timepicker only, or datepicker only works as well
[06:22:14] <DerStoffel> what is not working, is using both, timepicker is not appearing
[06:22:20] <DerStoffel> what's wrong there? any hints?
[06:22:33] <blackspotwiggins> timing, if you dont use any php in those templates
[06:22:50] <gnarf> DerStoffel: what are you using for your datepicker and your timepicker?
[06:22:53] <opius> ok, i just moved the function outside .ready , now it sort of works. but the #loadTest is still empty.. length returns 0
[06:23:19] <blackspotwiggins> timing, js templates have their use, just something that works for both php and js seems stupid
[06:23:43] <DerStoffel> gnarf: sorry, missed that, * jQuery timepicker addon * Version 0.9.5 and  * jQuery UI Datepicker 1.8.14
[06:23:49] <timing> blackspotwiggins: it should just have the same syntax in both implementations, that's all
[06:24:22] <gnarf> DerStoffel: there is more than one timepicker plugin i'm sure
[06:24:29] <gnarf> DerStoffel: can you link me to the one you are using?
[06:25:04] <DerStoffel> gnarf: timepicker: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[06:26:25] <LaszloKorte> Hey there. I have a problem with ajax and cookies: I have a modal window with a login form. it gets submitted via ajax. after logging in via an ajax request, all following ajax requests gets authenticated by the server. but when reloading the page or clicking a non-ajax link, the "via-ajax-set-cookie" does not get sent. Why? how to solve?
[06:27:10] <LaszloKorte> (browser: Chrome dev)
[06:27:56] <cornelinux> Hi, how do I set the ID for a button in a dialog?
[06:28:25] <LaszloKorte> THe other way round I have the same issue: When I open the page and deleting the cookies through the web inspector afterwards, the ajax requests on the current page still send the old cookies to the server
[06:33:22] <Fricass> hi ! is it possible to affect a same event to several field easily? (without rewriting the whole event)
[06:33:28] <Fricass> (such as an autocomplete)
[06:33:53] <DanFromUK> hi all. im just trying out jqueryUI for the first time. Using Dialog, was format should the validation text be? for the checkRegexp function.
[06:34:29] <gnarf> aha
[06:34:33] <gnarf> found it DerStoffel
[06:34:39] <DerStoffel> gnarf. shoot
[06:34:43] <DanFromUK> was = what
[06:34:45] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/qzZZp/
[06:34:59] <gnarf> DerStoffel: :nth-child(2) isn't true for the second input after datepicker put the button in between
[06:35:27] <DerStoffel> gnarf: i thought i restricted it to input fields
[06:35:35] <gnarf> ?:nth-child
[06:35:35] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[06:35:48] <gnarf> it does
[06:35:57] <gnarf> but there is no input:nth-child(2)
[06:36:04] <gnarf> anymore....
[06:36:11] <DerStoffel> gnarf: only input:nth-child(3)
[06:36:17] <DerStoffel> gnarf: thx heaps
[06:36:21] <gnarf> right, but screw using that
[06:36:26] <gnarf> look at the code i posted
[06:36:35] <gnarf> a little more straightforward readability wise
[06:36:47] <gnarf> still works with multiples
[06:36:55] <DerStoffel> gnarf: well, yes, thanks a lot :)
[06:36:59] <gnarf> just find all the inputs and use .eq()
[06:38:05] <LaszloKorte> is it correct that a cookie being set during an ajax request is not used for a normal request being mate later?
[06:38:53] <rocktop> hello its possible to execute mysql request under this function :    function removeFormField(id) { 	$(id).remove();}
[06:39:16] <DerStoffel> gnarf: thats brilliant, works like a charm
[06:39:32] <LaszloKorte> rocktop: yes, you have to make an ajaxrequest to a script on the server
[06:40:14] <gnarf> LaszloKorte: i vaguely remember running into that bug
[06:40:17] <rocktop> LaszloKorte: its possible to give me an exmaple about that and thanks in advance ?
[06:40:48] <LaszloKorte> $.post('url/to/your/script.php', function(servers_response_text) { // this function get called when the request is complete });
[06:40:52] <gnarf> LaszloKorte: also, cant set a cookie in a redirected request either
[06:41:17] <krogant> hi, other than cycling through a class and setting an id on one particular element, is there an easier way with jq to move an id between elements?
[06:42:01] <krogant> ie. i click one element, it gets the id, i click another element, and i want the id to move to that new lement
[06:42:10] <bjhaid> there are so many elements with the same id (dynamically generated), how do i remove the first match of the element?
[06:42:27] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, you are doing it wrong
[06:42:31] <blackspotwiggins> ids are supposed to be unique
[06:42:41] <krogant> bjhaid: other way around
[06:42:49] <krogant> you want to delete all but the first
[06:42:58] * blackspotwiggins facepalms
[06:43:30] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: sorry class, i am generating dialog pop dynamically and need to delete the first once another is generated
[06:43:36] <LaszloKorte> gnarf: hm thats bad. I have a javascript-application which works mostly offline. but the data should be saved on the server when clicking "save". But after working 3 ours whiteout saving the session is timed out and I need a modal window to login again. that works. but when returning to the project-list after saving I am logged out again because that is not ajax request and the cookie from the modal-login-window is lost. Any ideas?
[06:44:45] <Fricass> hi ! is it possible to affect a same event to several field easily? (without rewriting the whole event)
[06:45:21] <gnarf> LaszloKorte: set the cookie by hand from the request headers?
[06:45:26] <gnarf> or response headers rather
[06:45:49] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: any ideas?
[06:45:55] <blackspotwiggins> ?removeClass @ bjhaid
[06:45:55] <bot-t> bjhaid, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[06:46:07] <krogant> is there a more optimal way of line 7 here: http://pastebin.com/Am9DRhGh
[06:46:15] <blackspotwiggins> please make an effort to figure the rest out for yourself
[06:46:54] <blackspotwiggins> krogant, why the hell are you swapping ids around?
[06:47:10] <krogant> blackspotwiggins: isn't that... obvious?
[06:47:20] <blackspotwiggins> not really
[06:47:33] <gnarf> krogant: are all the .product-color-thumb siblings?
[06:47:37] <krogant> you've never wanted to set css on a selected element?
[06:47:40] <gnarf> krogant: also, do you need to use the id?
[06:47:50] <gnarf> can you just use a second class?
[06:47:52] <blackspotwiggins> krogant, i dont fucking use ids to do that
[06:47:54] <krogant> gnarf: yeah to siblings. also the id is only for styling
[06:48:03] <gnarf> .product-color-thumb-selected ?
[06:48:20] <krogant> blackspotwiggins: well like you said above... there's only one id. just like only one element can be selected
[06:48:41] <blackspotwiggins> so?
[06:48:42] <Lampoon> so are you
[06:48:45] <krogant> gnarf: an id would make more sense and i'm a bit ocd like that ;)
[06:48:57] <gnarf> its horrid pattern
[06:49:31] <krogant> why?
[06:49:33] <gnarf> class makes "more sense"
[06:49:43] <blackspotwiggins> also, :checked
[06:49:45] <blackspotwiggins> it works
[06:50:30] <krogant> a class is for multiple elements. only one element can be selected at a time. therefore, an id makes "more sense"
[06:51:04] <blackspotwiggins> krogant, so jquery ui for example is doing it wrong?
[06:51:13] <krogant> i have no idea how jquery ui workd
[06:51:23] <blackspotwiggins> they use classes for stuff like :hover even
[06:51:26] <blackspotwiggins> never mind selected
[06:51:28] <ajpiaNOU> krogant: an id is typically a static thing
[06:51:28] <gnarf> just because a class can be applied to "multiple elements" doesn't mean it can't also be applied to "one element"
[06:51:39] <ajpiaNOU> it's not something you move around as a state indicator
[06:52:02] <krogant> ajpiaNOU: so what makes an id not movable, but a class more commonly movable?
[06:52:19] <Whirl3d> How do I get chrome to quit caching my style sheets when I am debugging on my local server?
[06:52:29] <LaszloKorte> gnarf: hm it seems the cookie is not in the return value of the jxhr objects getAllResponseHeaders method. But I see it in the web inspector...
[06:53:05] <blackspotwiggins> LaszloKorte, if the cooke is httponly, you prolly cant access it
[06:53:20] <blackspotwiggins> if you are doing requests to same domain, it should work
[06:53:24] <gnarf> krogant: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/nrwa4/
[06:53:46] <blackspotwiggins> either that, or you could use something elsefor auth, like tokens or similar
[06:53:49] <gnarf> feel free to switch back to fucking with ID but its a bad design to use
[06:54:03] <gnarf> or in the event of a xhr
[06:54:06] <gnarf> pass a json response
[06:54:10] <gnarf> with the cookie info
[06:54:51] <krogant> gnarf: congrats? you've done exactly what i've done with classes
[06:55:33] <gnarf> asshole
[06:56:02] <gnarf> nevermind the fact that this way is like way more performant, caching the the selections
[06:56:11] <_delirium> I am calling .addClass() on line 13 http://pastebin.com/82ACf63t but getting an error in IE8 - Object or Property is not supported, it does work in Chrome though, any ideas?
[06:56:12] <gnarf> use attr id if you want
[06:56:19] <gnarf> but don't be a dick to people helping you
[06:56:53] <blackspotwiggins> just use .css() all day erry day
[06:56:56] <blackspotwiggins> that's even better
[06:58:49] <_delirium> blackspotwiggins: was that the answer to my question?
[06:59:16] <blackspotwiggins> no, sorry
[06:59:42] <Dangr_> Hello all I have a mobile WebKit question: A site I'm working on is using FancyBox and it moves in a strange way only when zoomed in - it happens in iOS and Android - does anyone know of a fix to make it stop jumping around?
[06:59:54] <Dangr_> It works just fine when not zoomed in
[07:00:17] <noobie25> i have i think an easy question .... I basically want to store some new data for each of my "list items" so that I know exactly which one was selected.   Here is the pastebin:
[07:00:22] <noobie25> http://pastebin.com/9DnrVz53
[07:00:45] <gnarf> LaszloKorte: did you see my mention of passing a json response to your "xhr login" request?
[07:01:08] <kborchers> ?hey @ gnarf
[07:01:08] <bot-t> Hey gnarf
[07:01:22] <gnarf> mornin kborchers
[07:01:37] <kborchers> don't you love how appreciative "most" people are of help in here? ;)
[07:01:43] <krogant> gnarf: it was you being a dick to me for asking why your way was so superior. to which you were unable to answer. (for the record)
[07:01:54] <gnarf> krogant: i don't need to answer it
[07:02:08] <kborchers> krogant: look at it like this. if you wanted to look different depending on what you were doing that day (going to work, going to the park ...), would you just change your clothes to identitfy with the new situation (class) or would you give yourself an entirely new identity (id)?
[07:02:21] <krogant> s/don't need to /can't
[07:02:27] <Fricass> hi ! is it possible to affect a same event to several field easily? (without rewriting the whole event)
[07:02:30] <gnarf> you know what i can do?
[07:02:46] <ajpiano> now now
[07:02:47] <ajpiano> :)
[07:02:49] <krogant> heh
[07:03:04] <krogant> kborchers: that makes no sense
[07:03:11] <gnarf> quick poll #jquery
[07:03:17] <blackspotwiggins> krogant, you could use <span>s for everything with display:block
[07:03:19] <gnarf> Lets say you have 10 elements, one of them is selected
[07:03:23] <blackspotwiggins> that does not mean it's the right way to do things
[07:03:25] <LaszloKorte> gnarf: thank you for the idea. I will try. Another problem is I did not write the server side auth system and it looks a bit messy :P
[07:03:25] <ajpiano> krogant: a number of us in here have been doing this for quite a long time and have never seen someone trying to move an ID around as a transient state indicator
[07:03:33] <gnarf> do you use addClass/removeClass "selected" or do you use ID?
[07:03:35] <krogant> ajpiano: that makes more sense
[07:03:43] <ajpiano> that's what i said a few minutes ago
[07:03:59] <gnarf> krogant: I wan't trying to tell you my way was "better" just the "standard practice"
[07:04:01] <Whirl3d> I have asked this question a couple of times and I think I am not asking it correctly: if each page that I load via ajax has it's own custom initialization routine, how can I call that dynamically during the "showPage" function?
[07:04:05] <krogant> ajpiano: i know. i was just saying it made more sense than what gnarf was spouting
[07:04:17] <krogant> ajpiano: i don't understand why not though. an id is for one element only
[07:04:20] <gnarf> your way is "awkward" to work with
[07:05:14] <Fricass> gnarf: help me plz :(
[07:05:22] <ajpiano> krogant: because it's an identifier for a unique element.. just because you have a particular state that exists on one thing at a time, doesn't mean you should use an ID for it
[07:05:34] <gnarf> "state" makes sense as a class
[07:05:37] <gnarf> more than an ID
[07:06:15] <gnarf> bonus: classes can be very easily added and removed in jQuery
[07:06:16] <Dangr_> Hello all I have a mobile WebKit question: A site I'm working on is using FancyBox and it moves in a strange way only when zoomed in - it happens in iOS and Android - does anyone know of a fix to make it stop jumping around?
[07:06:21] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is it possible to find co-ordinate of mouse regarding a div ?
[07:06:42] <hirakchatterjee> can  there be an issue with jQuery.fn if we load jQuery twice and try to add a plugin to the document after we have loaded jQuery for the 2nd time ?
[07:06:44] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, yes
[07:06:48] <Whirl3d> Paveloosha, have you checked google?
[07:06:56] <krogant> addClass('foo') vs attr('id','foo') == one char less ;)
[07:07:02] <kborchers> Fricass: can you rephrase your question? i'm not sure i understand what you are trying to do
[07:07:21] <ajpiano> krogant:  yeah, but there's no toggleID function... an element can't have more than one ID, etc.
[07:07:43] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, how would you set more than one state
[07:07:47] <ajpiano> 10 times out of 10 every frontend developer i know would use a class instead of an ID in that situation
[07:07:48] <blackspotwiggins> one birrion ids?
[07:07:54] <krogant> ajpiano: well, the state is either selected or not selected
[07:07:59] <krogant> a simple boolean thing
[07:08:04] <gnarf> krogant: stop arguing with the experts?
[07:08:05] <Paveloosha> yes I checked but I cant find any logic to get that..
[07:08:29] <Paveloosha> <blackspotwiggins>, can you please show me a light?
[07:08:36] <ajpiano> krogant: are you playing devil's advocate or planning to actually stick with ID
[07:08:40] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, deconstruct the problem
[07:08:47] <Fricass> Imagine that I have two input such as input id="first" and input id="second" and I want to affect them the same jQuery event (autocomplete) for example without doing $('#first').autocomplete(...) and $('#second').autocomplete(...) ?
[07:08:51] <gnarf> krogant: you came here to ask a "performance" question
[07:08:51] <Fricass> kborchers:
[07:08:52] <gnarf> my fiddle
[07:08:53] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, can you get the mouse coordinates relative to the page?
[07:09:00] <gnarf> if you ignore the fact that i switch to using a class
[07:09:07] <Whirl3d> Paveloosha, http://tinyurl.com/3zy23x2
[07:09:12] <Paveloosha> <blackspotwiggins>, yes I can find that..
[07:09:12] <gnarf> shows you a way to increase your performance, by caching your selections
[07:09:25] <krogant> ajpiano: no devil's advocate. the answer, 'use a class; it's better' doesn't really explain why. 'just because' as gnarf says is hardly helpful
[07:09:28] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, can you gind the divs position relative to the page?
[07:09:54] <gnarf> krogant: there isn't a great reason its better
[07:09:59] <gnarf> krogant: but its the standard practice
[07:10:07] <gnarf> well
[07:10:18] <gnarf> one reason it is better is now those things can have other maybe more useful ids
[07:10:25] <bjhaid> any reason why this does not work in a dialog? setTimeout(function(){$('.ui-dialog-content').text().replaceWith('<p>a</p>')},1000);
[07:10:29] <Whirl3d> krogant, no one owes you an explanation. This is not a paid service where people are required to help. If you want help, they are offering. If you want to argue, pay someone to listen
[07:10:32] <Paveloosha> <blackspotwiggins> actually that div is under another div..
[07:10:33] <kborchers> Fricass: you could do $("#first, #second").autocomplete() assuming you want the autocompletes to act exactly the same
[07:10:42] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, does it matter?
[07:10:49] <Fricass> really
[07:11:13] <Paveloosha> not mainly, but that was my structure.
[07:11:28] <blackspotwiggins> so, previous question -> can you get the divs position relative to page?
[07:11:34] <ajpiano> bjhaid, .text() doesn't return a jQuery object
[07:11:50] <Paveloosha> yes I can find that
[07:11:59] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha, now with those bits of information
[07:12:05] <blackspotwiggins> using arithmetic
[07:12:12] <ajpiano> Paveloosha: you can basically use the mousemove event to get the coordinates of the mouse relative to the page, and then use .offset() to get the coordinates of the div.  and then you subtract the coordinates of the div from the coordinates of the mousemove, and you get the coordinates of the mouse relative to the div
[07:12:16] <blackspotwiggins> can you figure out how to find mouse position relative to the div?
[07:12:22] <kborchers> ?down jsfiddle.net
[07:12:30] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, you ruined the surprise :D
[07:12:30] <bot-t> kborchers, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[07:12:31] <ajpiano> which is what blackspotwiggins is desciribing :p
[07:12:41] <kborchers> i am really close to giving up on jsfiddle
[07:12:45] <bjhaid> ajpiano: this doesnt work either setTimeout(function(){$('.ui-dialog-content').replaceWith('<p>a</p>')},1000);
[07:12:47] <gnarf> kborchers: the fiddle.jshell has been slow as heck today
[07:12:48] <blackspotwiggins> teach a man to fish, etc
[07:12:49] <krogant> Whirl3d: thanks for your thorough explanation of irc to me. i now feel much fulfilled and can lead a better life. thanks once again
[07:13:20] <kborchers> it happens all the time ... really annoying. probably going to swith to jsbin permenantly
[07:13:30] <gnarf> kborchers: :(
[07:13:40] <Whirl3d> Im just asking you to quit hogging the expertise. Others have questions and would be willing to accept the help we can get without arguing
[07:13:48] <bjhaid> ajpiano: the dialog diasppears instead just replacing that div element
[07:14:02] <Paveloosha> hmm .. thanks guys.. it sounds great now.. let me have a try..
[07:14:17] <netboffin> is there an easy way to ensure a dialog can't be dragged outside it's parent division?
[07:15:02] <krogant> Whirl3d: wtf? "no one owes you an explanation"...
[07:15:17] <gnarf> krogant: do you know how to just ignore trolls?
[07:15:24] <gnarf> krogant: :)
[07:15:35] <gao> hello can someone pelase help me with cycle?
[07:15:36] <anli_> If I .show an element, will it immediately be matched against :visible?
[07:15:48] <gnarf> ?ask @gao
[07:15:49] <bot-t> gao, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:15:49] <anli_> gao: only if you ask a question
[07:16:01] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, should be
[07:16:12] <anli_> hm, must be some other errors in the code
[07:16:30] <anli_> blackspotwiggins: I tried to addClass('visible') to see if adding classes is more responsive
[07:16:31] <kborchers> anli_: if you just use show(), yes. if you add a duration, i don't think it's :visible until after the animation
[07:16:46] <anli_> kborchers: But there is no animation so to say
[07:17:03] <kborchers> there is if you have a duration
[07:17:12] <anli_> But I have no duration
[07:17:23] <kborchers> ok, then it should be :visible immediately
[07:17:27] <anli_> aha
[07:19:00] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, is personally use classes for that as well
[07:19:22] <gao> http://gao-subs.com/manga/paper_plane_play/volume_1/chapter_0/
[07:19:22] <krogant> gnarf: i see trolls as a sport and get a perverse pleasure from it :/
[07:19:31] <blackspotwiggins> i think :visible is potentially misleading
[07:19:43] <gao> on that page i have 4 slideshows.. but as you can see it only cycles when you click on the bottom right of the image
[07:19:54] <anli_> blackspotwiggins: How can it be misleading?
[07:20:04] <_delirium> So anyone know why line 13 here - line 13 http://pastebin.com/82ACf63t errors in IE 8, but works fine in Chrome, I though jQuery was meant to be cross platform...
[07:20:09] <anli_> But maybe you are right
[07:20:16] <kborchers> all this talk of trolls ... i can't resist
[07:20:17] <gnarf> kborchers: :visible == :not(:hidden)
[07:20:22] <kborchers> ?troll @ krogant
[07:20:22] <bot-t> krogant, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1261442/troll.swf
[07:20:28] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, :visible doesnt mean you can actually see it
[07:20:36] <blackspotwiggins> it might be covered by some other element
[07:20:40] <anli_> But thats good
[07:20:44] <blackspotwiggins> or offscreen
[07:20:54] <anli_> I only want to know if it is visible as far as the element self knows
[07:20:54] <blackspotwiggins> i dont know if it checks for opacity
[07:21:02] <anli_> I hope not
[07:21:09] <krogant> kborchers: hehe
[07:21:25] <anli_> All I want it is check is the display style
[07:21:26] <Alqounkiz> guys, how do you get your user on irc to be different from your ip?
[07:21:29] <krogant> kborchers: though if that was directed at me. you fail. i asked a genuine question
[07:21:41] <blackspotwiggins> Alqounkiz, vhost
[07:21:42] <anli_> We all do
[07:21:44] <kborchers> no no ... just showing you for future use krogant
[07:21:57] <krogant> ok, so example: <gameOfTig><kid/><kid/><kid id="it"/><kid/></gameOfTig>
[07:22:01] <anli_> Wait, I may have copied questions
[07:22:08] <gao> guys.. in cycle how can i have multipled "next"'s for a slideshow?
[07:23:03] <krogant> that's about the best i can explain i think of attributes. of course, if each kid was to be given an id for their name, then by class would by the only available option. as a way of labelling the kid as tagged
[07:23:12] <gnarf> gao: docs#9381
[07:23:13] <bot-t> gao, [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (closed bug: fixed in v1.6.3) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[07:23:13] <gnarf> oops
[07:23:16] <gnarf> docs#9382
[07:23:18] <bot-t> [#9382] Click isn't triggered with mouse but it's ok by code (closed bug: worksforme) - http://jqbug.com/9382
[07:23:21] <gnarf> oh wait
[07:23:26] <gnarf> i got the number right the first time
[07:23:50] <gao> umm/..?
[07:23:59] <gnarf> gao: it will work in jQuery 1.5, or potentially if the guy who writes "cycle" updates it
[07:24:19] <gnarf> or maybe in jQuery 1.6.3 with a flag, or maybe by itself, still unknown the fate of that one
[07:24:30] <kborchers> please, don;t get gnarg started on rAF ;)
[07:24:37] <kborchers> gnarf
[07:25:09] <gnarf> gao: animations "pause" when you tab out of the window
[07:25:19] <gnarf> gao: but cycle keeps "queueing"
[07:25:28] <gnarf> so when you come back there are a bunch of anims to play
[07:25:33] <gnarf> is that what you are seeing?
[07:26:55] <bjhaid> why does replaceWith not work in a dialog box, and append works in the same line?
[07:27:44] <gao> ok sorry kborchers
[07:27:52] <gao> i'll try not to lol
[07:28:41] <kborchers> heh ... i was just kidding. it's just a huge topic with the core team right now
[07:29:17] <gnarf> kborchers: did u see the forum thread? :)
[07:29:35] <gao> i don't think that's my problem gnarf.. I have 4 slideshows, if I click on any of the slideshows i want them all to go to their next slide
[07:29:37] <kborchers> yeah ... i keep -dev open and attend the meetings
[07:29:48] <kborchers> not the forum though
[07:30:04] <gnarf> gao: aha, that makes more sense than what you initially described, but i have no idea how to do that one :)
[07:30:12] <blackspotwiggins> is -dev open to everyone?
[07:30:12] <gnarf> and don't feel like digging into cycle
[07:30:23] <gnarf> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe
[07:30:28] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: yup
[07:30:30] <gnarf> so is -meeting
[07:30:35] <blackspotwiggins> i knew about meeting
[07:30:47] <kborchers> blackspotwiggins: and jqueryui-dev
[07:31:34] <blackspotwiggins> not that into ui
[07:32:37] <gnarf> ?channels
[07:32:38] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev -#jquerymobile-dev
[07:33:05] <blackspotwiggins> i had this memory that -dev was closed to plebes
[07:33:15] <gao> well then how do i make the last picture in my slideshow go to a new website when it is clicked?
[07:34:43] <kborchers> blackspotwiggins: nope, they just won't answer support questions there. they'll direct you back here. it's very interesting even just to watch the conversations and see where things are headed
[07:36:11] <kborchers> gnarf: that is a crazy forum thread! though, it seems to be all of the same points i have seen in the IRC convos with just a little more content to actually explain points. it is a very interesting topic though.
[07:36:17] <gerpaiuck> h
[07:36:25] <gnarf> kborchers: weigh in ;)
[07:36:31] <gnarf> if you have an opinion
[07:38:14] <gerpaiuck> hi, i would like to load some of the variable values from some csv/txt/js/json file. is it possible to do?
[07:38:37] <pickels> I am using jquery tmpl to render some html data from the server but it seems to be escaping it. Is there a way to say a value is safe?
[07:41:10] <safzouf> Hi all!
[07:41:20] <safzouf> Does anyone created a zoom windows that follows the cursor?
[07:41:26] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, that's a tough one. i can see both sides of the argument. i do tend to agree with you though. i don't like the idea of taking something away that is already there, just to add it back in again later when a flag could do that for those stragglers and everybody wins.
[07:41:28] <safzouf> http://france.hermes.com/femme/carres/carres-90cm/twill-de-soie/red/marcelina-11645.html?nuance=nuance03
[07:41:51] <safzouf> in the example it's in flash, We need to make this zoom effect with js
[07:41:56] <safzouf> is that possible?
[07:41:57] <safzouf> help
[07:42:49] <safzouf> any help?
[07:43:07] <safzouf> is anybody's there? :o
[07:43:25] <kborchers> safzouf: if you google jquery zoom, there are a bunch of solutions
[07:43:40] <safzouf> I have did that
[07:43:47] <safzouf> the solution I want is not available
[07:44:14] <noobie25> hi ... i'm making some .html changes which works... however, when viewing source, it doesn't show the changes reflected in the html source code ....  should it show a refreshed version?
[07:44:34] <kborchers> safzouf: really? doesn't this do what you want? http://css-tricks.com/examples/AnythingZoomer/image.php
[07:45:12] <safzouf> !
[07:45:19] <safzouf> you great ;)
[07:45:30] <safzouf> thanks kborchers :)
[07:45:39] <kborchers> safzouf: that was in the first result when i googled jquery zoom
[07:45:49] <safzouf> yes,
[07:46:05] <safzouf> I search with: zoom stick cursor
[07:47:18] <kborchers> noobie25: when you view source, the browser shows you the original html that was rendered. if you use firebug or chromes console, you can inspect the html as it changes and see the difference
[07:47:55] <gerpaiuck> hi, i would like to load some of the variable values from some csv/txt/js/json file. is it possible to do?
[07:50:11] <noobie25> kborchers,   thanks~  i just checked firebug it i can see the changes.
[07:50:20] <noobie25> kborchers,   how do i access the chrome console?
[07:50:48] <kborchers> easist way is to right click (or option/click) and go to inspect element
[07:51:18] <noobie25> kborchers, ... thanks a lot for you help~
[07:51:23] <kborchers> np
[07:57:17] <noobie25> i'm trying to modify a 'form input value' but having trouble with selector / modification.   here is what i have   $("form#firstform input")
[07:57:48] <noobie25> the problem is i have multiple "input" and don't know how I can modify the 'value' tag
[08:00:00] <kborchers> noobie25: you can give your input an id and then just do $("#inputID").val(newVal); or you can use the input's name $("input[name='inputName']").val(newVal);
[08:01:17] <noobie25> kborchers,   thannks again!!   i'm using the first one... but will try the 2nd one as well in case i end up not using id's
[08:01:55] <kborchers> noobie25: it would be best to use id's. that will be your fastest selection
[08:02:36] <noobie25> kborchers,  i didn't know that.   i will work on putting id's everywhere i need so it doesn't slow down my application :).. thanks.
[08:04:48] <noobie25> kborchers,  by the way, i notice some people using 'name' and hardly anyone using 'id' for the input fields in a form.   what's the difference?
[08:05:16] <kborchers> name is what you will get on the server side when you process the form, not id
[08:06:04] <noobie25> kborchers,   if i use 'id' on  client side... does server just recognize it as 'name' then?
[08:06:11] <noobie25> kborchers,  in case i serialize some data?
[08:06:13] <kborchers> no, you will need both
[08:06:27] <noobie25> kborchers,   got it ...thanks !
[08:07:21] <lduros> if I'm going to take a parameter from the url like q=SomeValue and place it using jquery in an input value, is there any escape I should do to prevent cross-site scripting? Thanks
[08:08:03] <gao> please does anyone know how i can make 4 different slideshows go to the next slide when any one of them is clicked?
[08:09:51] <dub54> hey, trying to make an ajax request when a link is clicked and then continue to the link page but doesn't seem to fire the request, code: http://pastebin.com/ftXexT9m
[08:12:35] <Bower^> lduros, did you find anything for that? I'm after something similar
[08:12:55] <lduros> Bower^: no not really
[08:13:01] <Bower^> damn
[08:13:17] <lduros> Bower^: it's easy to find for server-side scripting languages but for javascript I can't find :-\
[08:13:25] <HealingDruid> how do I output the value of a function to a specific div?
[08:14:10] <Bower^> HealingDruid, $(div).text(function())
[08:14:13] <kborchers> ?html @ HealingDruid
[08:14:14] <bot-t> HealingDruid, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:14:39] <HealingDruid> okay, thank you guys, im going to go try that now
[08:14:42] <HealingDruid> i appreciate it
[08:14:45] <kborchers> np
[08:16:11] <Bower^> HealingDruid, sorry I should be more clear. You'll need to give the respective div an id or class to use the method I mentioned. $('#divID') or $('.divClass')
[08:17:52] <HealingDruid> Bower^: yeah i know that much, but my javascript skills in outputing functino data is limtied to document.write
[08:17:54] <lduros> Bower^: I found this: http://www.27seconds.com/kb/article_view.aspx?id=31
[08:18:07] <lduros> Bower^: if you remove all non-alphanumeric values you should be ok right?
[08:18:25] <Bower^> lduros, cheers. Yeah I think so mate
[08:18:29] <lduros> Bower^:it removes cross-site scripting risks correct? :-)
[08:18:30] <lduros> hehe
[08:18:45] <lduros> Bower^: of course it wouldn't work if you want other things than just plain text in there
[08:18:46] <lduros> but well
[08:19:21] <AayPizzle> Hey this may be related to jQuery or maybe not, but I suspect it is. Does binding an <input> element to an event cause <label> tag's click behavior to be different? (The one where you click on label and it clicks the input)
[08:19:33] <Bower^> I don't really know enough about XSS man. If you're code is inside an anonymous function then it can't be accessed through the global scope so naughty scripts can't do anything to dit
[08:19:40] <Bower^> your code*
[08:19:59] <gf3> AayPizzle: no, it shouldn't
[08:20:07] <AayPizzle> hmmmm
[08:20:16] <gf3> AayPizzle: clicking a label causes focus of the related input
[08:21:03] <lduros> Bower^: what do you mean an anonymous function?
[08:21:35] <AayPizzle> gf3: Do the inputs have to be in an arbitrary form? Only the last one in the series of inputs seem to work
[08:21:35] <Bower^> A function without a name
[08:21:48] <AayPizzle> gf3: The last input/label pair that is
[08:21:57] <lduros> Bower^: oh ok
[08:22:01] <Bower^> lduros, (function(){})()
[08:22:06] <gf3> AayPizzle: inputs should generally be wrapped in a form at some level
[08:22:20] <lduros> yeh I don't use that
[08:22:31] <Bower^> I believe it's good practice
[08:22:31] <gf3> AayPizzle: are you sure the `for` attribute doesn't have a misspelling or something?
[08:22:39] <lduros> I use: myFunction: function(test) { }, in my object
[08:22:39] <Bower^> You don't wanna be exposing your code to the global scope
[08:22:48] <Bower^> Unless you're creating some library
[08:22:51] <AayPizzle> gf3: Yeah, i checked it over multiple times
[08:23:03] <lduros> Thanks for the tip :-)
[08:23:05] <gf3> AayPizzle: make a JSFiddle
[08:23:10] <Bower^> np
[08:23:54] <Bower^> lduros, you should read into them. Besides hiding from the global scope, they're quite useful
[08:24:47] <lduros> Bower^: fyi, i added this to my script: 	stripNonAlphaNumChars: function (string) {	    var string_out = new String(string);  string_out = string_out.replace(/[^0-9A-Z]/gi, ''); return string_out; } -- this only leaves numbers and letters, that's it
[08:24:47] <dualcore> how to i get the "test" value when clicking this <a href="javascript:;">test</a>
[08:25:07] <lduros> and I run it on a string before inserting in the dom
[08:25:15] <Bower^> Nice lduros, thanks man
[08:25:36] <seutje> gf3: I have a new coworker that reminds me of you every day
[08:25:46] <gf3> seutje: LIES
[08:25:47] <seutje> just so u know, ur on my mind on a daily basis
[08:25:50] <AayPizzle> gf3: I'm going to try a couple more things, if I can't figure it out I'll JSFIddle it up
[08:26:02] <seutje> gf3: I'd never lie to you!
[08:26:02] <gf3> seutje: why are you not in -ot? STOP BEING A SILLY
[08:26:17] <seutje> gf3: it's not an on/off switch
[08:26:22] <seutje> it's a birth defect
[08:26:33] <gf3> seutje: STOP BEING A BIRTH DEFECT!
[08:26:37] <seutje> lol
[08:26:38] <Bower^> :D
[08:26:42] <seutje> NO U!
[08:26:44] <gf3> seutje: (am I helping?)
[08:26:46] <gf3> NO NO U
[08:26:49] <enjoycrf> haha
[08:26:53] <enjoycrf> hulow
[08:27:12] <seutje> gf3: not rly, I'll be back when I feel like I've earned it
[08:27:26] <letterpress> can someone look at this fiddle and tell me why datepicker's onselect is firing when i create a datepicker on a <div>? http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/4/
[08:27:30] <gf3> seutje: well get on that
[08:27:36] <letterpress> er, onSelect I mean
[08:27:42] <gf3> seutje: I need someone to talk Q3 smack to
[08:28:01] <seutje> isn't ben an old quaker as well?
[08:28:37] <letterpress> when i create the datepicker on an input, it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/5/

[08:31:01] <AuroraX> dualcore: $("a").html()
[08:31:10] <dualcore> oh duh
[08:31:30] <Bower^> dualcore, if you have more than one anchor element you can give it an id/class name
[08:31:32] <gnarf> I was always a UT fan
[08:31:46] <gf3> gnarf: works for me too
[08:32:06] <Bower^> it's all about cs 1.6 gentlemen
[08:32:09] <AayPizzle> gf3: input/label thing was fixed, apparently the id name conflicted somewhere
[08:32:15] <AayPizzle> gf3: thanks for your help
[08:32:15] <gf3> AayPizzle: yayyy
[08:32:20] <AuroraX> dualcore: yes, give it a name or an id, example <a id="banana">hello</a>   stays $("#banana").html()
[08:32:23] <gf3> Bower^: add it to the list
[08:32:23] <letterpress> AuroraX take out the second $ and call a method. are you trying var checked = $("#"+formName).is(":checked"); ??
[08:32:24] <gnarf> gf3: that was our lunch break game at the game shop i worked at in the early 2ks
[08:33:25] <AuroraX> letterpress: no, im trying to get all ":checked" inputs (children) from that form called «formName»
[08:35:16] <gf3> letterpress: $( 'form[name=' + formName + '] input:checked' )
[08:35:41] <dualcore> thanks guys i got it working here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/RM2h8/
[08:35:58] <letterpress> right yah, input:checked.
[08:36:04] <Bower^> Nice one dualcore :)
[08:36:26] <letterpress> AuroraX i was doing var checked = $("#"+formName).find("input:checked");
[08:36:52] <seutje> gf3: fuck yea!
[08:36:52] <letterpress> but hey, why is the onSelect firing here: http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/4/
[08:37:04] <seutje> gf3: still considering getting a Q3 tatoo :P
[08:37:11] <letterpress> ...when I create the datepicker on a <div> ?
[08:37:11] <gf3> seutje: do ittttt
[08:37:35] <seutje>  gf3: need I remind u how much of a pussy I am?
[08:37:56] <letterpress> oops wrong number , this is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/6/
[08:38:29] <letterpress> so datepicker on a <div> fires onSelect right off the bat. on an <input> it fires....when you select a date (as expected)
[08:38:59] <AuroraX> letterpress: yes, that's the idea :)  that will return a primitive js array? or i'll have to use get() to navigate trought the results?
[08:39:25] <seutje> gnarf: the double jump thing never worked in my brain
[08:39:44] <EdwardIII> are you guys talking FPS?
[08:40:11] <EdwardIII> man i loved the hell out of quake, i used to be the bees knees at it
[08:40:12] <gf3> seutje: for what game?
[08:40:19] <seutje> gf3: UT
[08:40:22] <gf3> EdwardIII: yeah
[08:40:30] <gf3> seutje: the back flip?
[08:40:44] <seutje> and it pisses me off that the visual beam from a shock rifle is slower than the actual hit
[08:41:40] <EdwardIII> i was the business at UT too
[08:41:52] <letterpress> AuroraX it will return an array of input elements yes. you can narrow this down any number of ways.
[08:42:17] <letterpress> but $.each() is the usual way to iterate through an jQuery array. so...
[08:42:45] <letterpress> checked.each(function(){  //stuff  });
[08:43:20] <letterpress> inside the each function, "this" is the input element (in yr case)
[08:44:25] <letterpress> ok i'll give this one more shot. why does this: http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/5/ work when http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/6/ doesn't? the only difference is that one attaches a datepicker to a <div> instead of an <input>
[08:44:50] <AuroraX> letterpress: var checked = $("#"+formName).find("input:checked");  alert(checked[i].attr("name"));   gives me error "attr is not a function"
[08:45:00] <gnarf> no matter which game, if it had telefrag it was awesome
[08:45:01] <gnarf> :)
[08:45:42] <letterpress> right you'll want to do checked.each(function(){ alert($(this).attr("name")) });
[08:45:59] <BlueTest> hi
[08:46:24] <ngharo> cpma / ra3 woot!
[08:46:29] <ngharo> good times
[08:46:29] <AuroraX> letterpress: so .get() or the standard array[n] wont work?
[08:46:34] <gnarf> letterpress: i
[08:46:40] <BlueTest> Can someone help me, the jQuery datepicker doesn't close in IE, even on jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/, has anyone found a solution for this?
[08:46:43] <gnarf> letterpress: I'm pretty sure datepicker only works on inputs
[08:47:04] <letterpress> if you need to run a jQuery method on one of the array items, just wrap then in ,...... jQuery!  $(checked[i]) . but that's kind of crazy
[08:47:11] <enjoycrf> not all plugins are cross browser
[08:47:11] <gnarf> letterpress: i could be way wrong tho
[08:47:20] <enjoycrf> who knows who writes those
[08:47:27] <enjoycrf> maybe some noobs
[08:47:37] <AuroraX> letterpress: yeah, i prefer .each lol
[08:47:42] <gnarf> BlueTest: "IE" is no were near descriptive enough, perhaps a version number?
[08:47:48] <BlueTest> IE7
[08:48:02] <letterpress> gnarf.... from the docs: By default, the datepicker calendar opens in a small overlay onFocus and closes automatically onBlur or when a date is selected. For an inline calendar, simply attach the datepicker to a div or span.
[08:48:06] <seutje> WFA was the best way to play Q3, hands down
[08:48:07] <enjoycrf> .each is awesome
[08:48:09] <seutje> till the devs killed it
[08:48:17] <gnarf> letterpress: then i guess i'm wrong
[08:48:19] <enjoycrf> wats WFA
[08:48:19] * gnarf shrugs
[08:48:23] <letterpress> that's from.... http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[08:48:29] <gnarf> letterpress: datepicker is ugly atm ;)
[08:48:30] <AuroraX> enjoycrf: except if you want only the nth element of the array :P
[08:48:32] <letterpress> yeah i be strugging too

[08:49:19] <gnarf> BlueTest: you know if you made me start up my ie7 vm to find a working demo i'll be mad ;)
[08:49:50] <BlueTest> I'm running XP mode, I hate it... but it's necessary
[08:50:07] <letterpress> AAAH rolled back to 1.8.9 jqueryui and it worked.
[08:50:15] <letterpress> so it appears we've introduced a bug
[08:50:20] <gnarf> BlueTest: datepicker closes in IE7
[08:50:48] <BlueTest> when you select a date?
[08:50:52] <gnarf> oh, but it pops back open
[08:50:57] <BlueTest> yeah...
[08:50:57] <gnarf> interesting
[08:51:03] <sphinxxx> can someone help me debug this :  http://jsfiddle.net/HKEAs/
[08:51:14] <sphinxxx> i keep getting "unexpected string" after the url:  line
[08:51:30] <letterpress> this just happens in 1.8.15
[08:51:39] <enjoycrf> i would roll back
[08:51:47] <gnarf> letterpress: .14 is safe
[08:51:48] <enjoycrf> and just fix the date
[08:51:48] <gnarf> ?
[08:51:54] <letterpress> rolling rolling rolling
[08:52:14] <letterpress> speaking of bleeding edge, where is 1.9 these days?
[08:52:28] <ravenzz> sphinxxx you need the brakets { }
[08:53:11] <gnarf> letterpress: "master"
[08:53:11] <ravenzz> +c
[08:53:54] <letterpress> thanks for your help gnarf
[08:55:14] <sphinxxx> ravenzz where? could you edit the fiddle?
[08:56:30] <ravenzz> $.ajax({
[08:56:48] <sphinxxx> ah
[08:57:02] <enjoycrf> who here <3s jquary
[08:57:36] <gnarf> letterpress: can you file a bug about it?
[08:57:43] <sphinxxx> hmm then i get "unexpected token ." where entry.0.single is
[08:57:43] <gnarf> or search for one that might already be there?
[08:57:52] <gnarf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[08:57:54] <sphinxxx> i'm trying to post to a google doc without using google's built-in forms
[08:58:08] <letterpress> trying to bf my noon meeting, can't remember my bug tracked pw....
[08:58:31] <ravenzz> sphinxxx entry[0].single ?
[08:58:33] <gnarf> BlueTest: I'm not sure whats happening there, and its really hard for me to dev in an IE envrionment from my laptop
[08:58:35] <letterpress> ok yes
[08:58:53] <gnarf> BlueTest: but I'm gonna have some people look at the problem
[08:59:01] <gnarf> BlueTest: have you tried a lower version of ui?
[08:59:23] <enjoycrf> plz for the love of god stop writing html w JS
[08:59:39] <BlueTest> gnarf: no, but I will, thanks for the help
[08:59:53] <gnarf> BlueTest: if you can find which version it broke in, that could be useful :)
[09:00:44] <gnarf> all of the vesrsions of UI should be available on the google cdn
[09:00:46] <Guest34436> is it possible to prevent blur on an input box from being called only when a select is made?
[09:01:22] <BlueTest> cool, I'll try it and let you know if I find a fix
[09:01:26] <gnarf> or even http://code.jquery.com/
[09:01:46] <gnarf> also letterpress - the jquery ui git is "1.9"
[09:02:01] <gnarf> or at least the working version for 1.9
[09:02:02] <gnarf> :)
[09:02:15] <seutje> Guest34436: $('select').bind('blur', function(e) { if ($(this).val()) { e.preventDefault();} }); perhaps?
[09:02:25] <gnarf> letterpress: is your problem still around in 1.8.16 ?
[09:02:26] <AuroraX> what's the equivalent of this in JS/JQ? array[] = "abc"
[09:02:38] <seutje> array.push('abc')
[09:02:49] <seutje> but I wouldn't call ur array array if I were u
[09:03:03] <letterpress> oh i should check
[09:04:08] <errormcerror> ok i looked it up seutje and i am confused what is the difference between stopPropagation and preventDefault ?
[09:04:09] <letterpress> 1.8.16 isn't on the google cdn. anywhere i can load that for my fiddle?
[09:04:18] <gnarf> letterpress: code.jquery.com
[09:04:25] <letterpress> feel free, though i'm late for my meeting....so i won't be able to check. ...
[09:04:29] <gnarf> it has a directory index :)
[09:04:37] <letterpress> http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/zYMB2/6/
[09:04:50] <letterpress> and here's the report: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7651
[09:04:53] <letterpress> gotta go thx
[09:04:55] <BlueTest> @gnarf: Guess what... it works in 1.8.13
[09:05:09] <gnarf> but not 1.8.14?
[09:05:13] <BlueTest> yep
[09:05:27] <seutje> errormcerror: preventdefault prevents the default action from occurring, stoppropagation stops the event from being propagated to other elements
[09:06:59] <seutje> I suck at explaining things without using cake references :'(
[09:09:34] <gnarf> BlueTest: mind filing a bug report with that info / a good description on http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[09:09:41] <BlueTest> @gnarf: My bad, it is only broken in 1.8.15, 1.8.14 works
[09:09:51] <gnarf> BlueTest: actually
[09:09:52] <BlueTest> sure
[09:09:56] <gnarf> BlueTest: check out 1.8.16
[09:09:57] <letterpress> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7651 is ok?
[09:10:03] <gnarf> scott tells me its fixed
[09:10:07] <BlueTest> ok
[09:10:12] <letterpress> ok cool thx
[09:12:42] <_delirium> anyone have a moment to help me understand why i am seeing a problem in IE 8 but not Chrome with jQuery 1.6.2?
[09:13:11] <BlueTest> @gnarf: it works with 1.8.16, cool, thanks man
[09:13:19] <Boosh> is there a way to tell what object triggered an event?
[09:13:39] <BlueTest> I don't see why my head developer likes to use local copies of javascript libraries...
[09:14:05] <blackswan> i need a plugin that lets me have two adjustable panes (horizontal or vertical) with a handle for the user to resize them. does anybody have any suggestions?
[09:14:21] <BlueTest> frameset? haha...
[09:15:17] <BlueTest> blackswan: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[09:15:55] <blackswan> no, that's not what i'm after.
[09:16:16] <blackswan> or maybe it is. hmm.
[09:16:59] <blackswan> i want the equivalent of a GtkPaned widget
[09:17:30] <enjoycrf> just make ur own
[09:17:32] <donburks> blackswan: http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/
[09:17:48] <blackswan> i'm barely capable of using javascript at the moment; i'd much rather find a plugin.
[09:17:55] <blackswan> that way it'd actually, like, work.
[09:18:13] <enjoycrf> oh
[09:20:09] <enjoycrf> i <3 jquery
[09:20:23] <enjoycrf> jquery <3 me
[09:20:24] <donburks> Love your jQuery...just don't LOVE your jQuery.
[09:21:06] <enjoycrf> jquery is mah frind
[09:23:51] <errormcerror> http://pastebin.com/XX3YVRft
[09:24:08] <errormcerror> if i put the preventdefault inside of the blur function then i can ever select anything
[09:24:18] <errormcerror> can not**
[09:24:45] <dabear> ?demo @ errormcerror
[09:24:45] <bot-t> errormcerror, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:25:25] <dabear> that is supposed to be e.preventDefault() though
[09:25:30] <dabear> and e must be defined
[09:25:54] <errormcerror> http://ahtracker.hostzi.com/shiptracker.php
[09:26:07] <errormcerror> check out a ship and you should have an input box
[09:26:09] <errormcerror> with an autocomplete
[09:26:57] <errormcerror> select any member and you should get the issue
[09:29:16] <errormcerror> basically i am just trying to prevent blurring upon selection from the autocomplete
[09:30:35] <trave> So, I added:  var $ = $ || function() { return false; } .... to a page as an attempted safeguard to, do a selector, without throwing an undefined error ... worked fine in FF/Chrome ... but it burned me bad, that IE re-assigned jquery as that stupid placeholder func.
[09:31:16] <trave> just for clarification, is that just because IE executes the $ function, and returned a falsey result?
[09:32:06] <trave> it should have been var $ = (typeof $ == "undefined") ? function() { alert("lame"); } : $; ?
[09:32:50] <snover> var $ = $; means var $; $ = $;
[09:34:40] <enjoycrf> falsey lol
[09:35:40] <errormcerror> :-(
[09:38:01] <errormcerror> so i take it there is not a way to prevent blurring on selection from the autocomplete?
[09:41:21] <ccmonster> maybe i'm wrong, but there is no event that I can bind to for when a jqueryui menu is 'open'
[09:41:24] <ccmonster> ?
[09:42:50] <AuroraX> how can i select elements with the attr "type" equal to "text" or "hidden" ?
[09:43:34] <trave> @ccmonster : menufocus, or menuselect are not sufficient?
[09:43:59] <ccmonster> i didnt see menufocus
[09:44:35] <ccmonster> oh drr. i see it
[09:44:39] <ccmonster> i just saw 'focus'
[09:44:47] <ccmonster> but isn't that just individual menu items?
[09:45:03] <trave> idunno, havent used jquery ui menus yet :]
[09:45:31] <ccmonster> Ah, in the events I see 'focus' and it says type: 'menufocus' ..so not sure how that's going to work.
[09:45:40] <trave> @AuroraX : $('input[type="hidden"]');  ?
[09:45:58] <AuroraX> trave: and text at the same time
[09:46:08] <AuroraX> trave: how do i make an OR in there?
[09:46:21] <trave> @AuroraX : $('input[type="hidden"], input[type="text"]');  ?
[09:46:37] <AuroraX> trave: the comma is an OR?
[09:47:14] <lduros> if you do: $('<a/>', {id: 'blah'}); this will create <a id="blah"></a> -- but how do I add classes to it? tried { class: 'myclass' } but this doesn't work, any idea?
[09:48:38] <gnarf> ccmonster: open?
[09:50:16] <errormcerror> guys do you know how to prevent blurring when an selection is made from an autocomplete?
[09:50:49] <Jon47> errormcerror, its easy to use the .focus method to focus an element
[09:51:10] <Jon47> you're using some custom library for your auto-complete feature that i"m guessing oyu did not write
[09:51:29] <Jon47> you'll have to muck around in the internals of that lib to figure your problem out, but check out .focus in jquery
[09:51:34] <ccmonster> gnarf, i didnt see an 'open' event listed.
[09:51:36] <ccmonster> maybe im blind.
[09:51:54] <errormcerror> @Jon47 no i am just using regular autocomplete
[09:51:56] <ccmonster> probably am lol. , but i didnt see it
[09:52:09] <errormcerror> http://pastebin.com/XX3YVRft
[09:52:39] <Jon47> there is no regular autocomplete
[09:52:42] <Jon47> you're using this: http://ahtracker.hostzi.com/js/jquery.autocomplete.min.js
[09:52:53] <errormcerror> oh right
[09:52:54] <errormcerror> sorry
[09:53:48] <orentanay> I'm dealing w/ dynamically setting up a Google Web Optimizer test, and was wondering if this looks legit? $('body').append('<script>utmx_section("swapArea")</script></noscript>'); It seems like it should, but it is a JS block, and have no idea if there are some trick I should be using? thanks.

[10:19:34] <Narad> so no idea :/ ... thats the probelem, I dont't know even. :/
[10:23:49] <Narad> so again... $("#" + data[i].resource + " > #" + data[i].key + " > div[name=" + key + "]").html("1"); why is this wrong?
[10:28:12] <checker> can someone help me with my jquery mobile problem ? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/is-data-scroll-true-active-in-jquery-mobile
[10:29:49] <kk> hello there!
[10:30:00] <Guest76362> could anybody tell me why this code is wrong?
[10:30:05] <Guest76362> http://jsfiddle.net/fryNv/
[10:30:38] <Guest76362> i need to click two butons when clicking one other
[10:30:43] <Guest76362> but it only clicks the first
[10:31:32] <peol> Guest76362: You're grabbing all 'a' in the DOM, you probably want $(this)
[10:31:54] <peol> or some such
[10:32:27] <Guest76362> ok yes you're right
[10:32:48] <Guest76362> what about if i want to click the second one after the first has finished?
[10:33:03] <guy> I get an error in var drawing	= $('#drawing-board')[0].export();
[10:33:06] <guy> in IE8
[10:33:07] <guy> what's wrong with this line?
[10:33:14] <henrikbjorn> Is there a jquery plugin for changing a select to a token autocomplete?
[10:33:22] <Guest76362> http://jsfiddle.net/fryNv/1/
[10:33:33] <Guest76362> i want to hide a first and then span
[10:33:38] <henrikbjorn> have found a bunch for a normal input field that submits a csv list of the values which is not very nice
[10:33:42] <Guest76362> how do i do that?
[10:33:50] <caaakeeey> hey, does anyone know of a syntax highlighter library for js hat lets you choose the colours dynamically?
[10:34:01] <RobW> anyone here update to ff6 yet?
[10:34:12] <RobW> because hardly anything in jquery works with ff6..
[10:34:48] <trave> Narad : We would need to see your code in context, but it seems to me that you would first want to iterate your JSON data and generate your HTML string first, append() it somewhere in the DOM, before needing to use a selector like that to modify any of its contents...
[10:35:20] <guy> anyone?
[10:35:43] <Guest76362> peol: how can I either make it delay the second click or wait for the first one to finish?
[10:38:33] <alabd1> Good day all , how to have jquery on linux ?
[10:38:59] <callumacrae> Is there any way to capture the escape button using jQuery?
[10:39:08] <Jon47> alabd1 jquery is system agnostic, it runs in a browser not in an OS
[10:39:25] <Jon47> so the answer to your question is, the same way as on any other OS
[10:39:54] <alabd1> Jon47: and how decompress a compressed .js file
[10:40:27] <callumacrae> alabd1: No need
[10:40:30] <trave> guy : I am unfamiliar with any .export() method.  Where did you come up with that?
[10:40:36] <Jon47> alabd1.. download the non-minified version ?
[10:40:44] <guy> it is custom method.
[10:41:04] <alabd1> Jon47: you mean we just should have a browser to use jquery farmwork ?
[10:41:06] <trave> a $.fn. method?
[10:41:18] <guy> trave: no. flash method.
[10:41:23] <Jon47> alabd1 well I guess anything with a javascript VM
[10:41:27] <Jon47> but usually a browser, yes
[10:41:54] <alabd1> Jon47: any other way except downloading non-minified ?
[10:42:13] <bakers> if I have a click event on a node, and inside the click function I log this, is this a jquery object, or a dom node obj?
[10:42:14] <Jon47> alabd1, Chrome has a nice "prettify" method for minified code
[10:42:22] <Jon47> i'm sure there are other ways, but there's no better ways
[10:42:30] <alabd1> Jon47: can not use chrome
[10:42:37] <trave> guy : unless that .export method is created as a .prototype method on the DOM element type you are attempting to bind it too, it seems like youd probably need to call it like:  export($('#selector')[0]);
[10:42:40] <Jon47> the unminified version probably has no comments, which you can never get back
[10:42:45] <Jon47> just download the unminified version
[10:42:58] <drwells> callumacrae: http://jsfiddle.net/HP7JZ/
[10:43:04] <alabd1> ok thanks bye
[10:43:12] <guy> trave: as I've said: it works perfectly fine in all browsers but not IE
[10:43:18] <callumacrae> Ooh I was console.logging charCode
[10:43:19] <callumacrae> >_<
[10:44:38] <larsemil> how do i substring everything but the four last characters?
[10:45:46] <larsemil> ah slice!
[10:46:39] <ccmonster> hey guys, I am trying to recursively process some xml and it doesn't seem to recurse in a particular situation: http://pastie.org/2392449
[10:46:44] <trave> guy : I hate IE, I had a lame bug with it earlier today too.  Idunno man... in some old code of mine, I had to make a reference to an SWF object like so:  o.swf = window[video_id] || document[video_id];   to work cross-browser
[10:46:59] <ccmonster> eww
[10:47:07] <drwells> larsemil: "string".slice(-3)
[10:47:32] <drwells> larsemil: the opposite s.slice(s.length-4)
[10:48:09] <iamjarvo> is anyone familiar with the galleria plugin. I was just wondering if it allowed for a fixed width of the large image. so say an image was smaller than 400px it would make it 400px. the only way i could think of was declaring it via css
[10:48:38] <lduros> IE8 doesn't work with this: item = $("#program-finder ul." + key + " li"); -- any idea why?
[10:49:59] <ccmonster> try to put that into a string first, then pass it into the $()
[10:50:09] <ccmonster> curious if it fires.
[10:50:33] <fission6> anyone here have experience with jPlayer
[10:50:37] <ccmonster> nada
[10:50:54] <lduros> ccmonster: who are you talking to?
[10:51:02] <iamjarvo> i guess it doesnt really make sense for the gallery to have a fixed width image
[10:51:04] <ccmonster> you lduros , sorry I didnt say your name.
[10:51:22] <lduros> ccmonster: ok, I wasn't sure, I'll try this. Hopefully it's just choking on + key +
[10:51:57] <ccmonster> could be, so lets create a string first, then pass it in to the $() and see if it's something that simple.
[10:52:10] <ccmonster> I don't assume anything when it comes to IE :(, other than it will be bad. lol
[10:52:24] <lduros> ccmonster: still the same
[10:52:39] <ccmonster> so what IS or IS NOT happening?
[10:52:41] <ccmonster> in either case
[10:52:52] <lduros> ccmonster: 	    for (key in params) {
[10:52:52] <lduros> 		s = "#program-finder ul." + key + " li";
[10:52:53] <lduros> 		item = $(s); }
[10:53:01] <lduros> and then I use item.each() on this
[10:53:09] <lduros> but the error is at: item = $(s);
[10:53:20] <lduros> and the error is: object doesn't support this action
[10:53:22] <ccmonster> you got a pastie or demo?
[10:53:33] <ccmonster> fiddle, perhaps
[10:53:41] <lduros> let me do pastie
[10:54:02] <ccmonster> k
[10:55:29] <ccmonster> why doesn't the method recurse in this node of the xml? http://pastie.org/2392449
[10:55:33] <ccmonster> any help would be appreciated.
[10:56:58] <gertidon> hello
[10:57:02] <ccmonster> hi
[10:57:06] <lduros> ccmonster: http://pastie.org/2392498
[10:57:36] <lduros> hmmm maybe it's because under in the conditional I have $(item) instead of item
[10:57:38] <lduros> let me try this
[10:57:58] <larsemil> i am doing some array stuff, and decreasing counter in array[counter]. how do i check if array[counter-1] exist? i tried if(array[counter-1].len() ) but that did not work
[10:58:25] <lduros> ccmonster: nope, didn't do the trick
[10:58:50] <larsemil> ah .eq might do it!
[10:58:57] <ccmonster> have you tried consolling out your keys in general?
[10:59:09] <ccmonster> just curious what its giving you
[10:59:14] <lduros> yeh it's fine, everything works well in firefox
[10:59:29] <lduros> actually in my pastie I forgot a closing } for the for loop
[10:59:37] <lduros> it works well in safari too
[10:59:44] <lduros> the error is on line 10
[11:00:29] <larsemil> ccmonster: of course. i have 0,1,2. But if i am at 0 i want it to make counter 2 so that it loops
[11:01:19] <ccmonster> have you tried just traversing instead of smashing it into a string and then selecting?
[11:01:29] <ccmonster> i was talking to lduros larsemil , sorry.
[11:01:31] <JAAulde> w00t, I am JSHinting in NetBeans now
[11:01:33] <lduros> yeh but i'll try again :-) let me sse ;-)
[11:01:34] <lduros> hehe
[11:01:37] <larsemil> in php i use array_key_exists
[11:01:47] <shaft0> I'm having issues with a script I'm writing.  Basically I'm trying to loop through every div with a class name starting with listing-info-(number starting at 1, ending at however many instances there are), and get the first image in those divs and displaying it as an LI, it's up here: http://www.citycore.creationrepublic.com/homes, but it seems to only take the first thumbnail.  Anyone have any ideas?
[11:02:36] <ccmonster> larsemil, cant you use find? or filter
[11:02:38] <gryzzly> hey guys, can I easily make a distinction between an event triggered with "trigger('click')" and actual click that was caused by user action? Thanks
[11:03:15] <gryzzly> shaft0: you also have two jqueries there
[11:04:22] <gryzzly> shaft0: this "var currentImgUrl = $('[class^=\'listing-description-\'] img:first').attr('src');" is probaby wrong, if I understand correctly what you aer trying to do
[11:04:36] <ccmonster> gryzzly, check out the events object
[11:04:45] <ccmonster> i think you can use original event or something.
[11:05:00] <gryzzly> shaft0: you should use $(this).find('img:first') or .find('img').first()
[11:05:25] <ccmonster> or you could create a custom event, and avoid the confusion
[11:05:41] <ccmonster> and bind your handler to the click, or 'triggeredclick' and then you always know ?
[11:06:31] <ccmonster> catch that gryzzly ?
[11:06:41] <gryzzly> ccmonster: I actually do need the original "click" event. I am "imitiating" users click on some elemnts, until users actually does something for himself.
[11:06:49] <larsemil> ccmonster: if("key" in object) was the correct way.
[11:07:10] <gryzzly> ccmonster: so within the handler I want to do someting like "if ( e.fake ) // do somtng "
[11:07:11] <ajpiano> or object.hasOwnProperty("key")
[11:07:18] <larsemil> ajpiano: yes saw that one as well
[11:07:38] <shaft0> gryzzly: I think that cleared things up, however I still have to figure out how to *append* html and not just replace it
[11:08:04] <shaft0> gryzzly:  It seemed to replace the first image with the second one, which was progress, haha, but replaced it rather than appended
[11:08:27] <kborchers> ?insertAfter @ shaft0
[11:08:27] <bot-t> shaft0, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[11:08:53] <gryzzly> shaft0: that's because you are using .html() use .append() on the parent element, or "inserAfter" as suggest
[11:09:37] <ccmonster> well then put custom data in the event obj
[11:09:49] <ccmonster> and change it depending on whether its your own triggered event, or the users
[11:10:01] <shaft0> Ahhh!  That's what I was after, cheers!
[11:10:36] <gryzzly> ccmonster: thanks for your help, I will probably take the data route, seems like event object is pretty much the same for both "clicks"
[11:10:50] <ccmonster> you can pass custom dat ainto the click
[11:12:04] <ccmonster> gryzzly, check the last few examples on the trigger page
[11:12:50] <ccmonster> it shows how to do $('el').trigger({type:'click','from':'page'})
[11:13:08] <ccmonster> and then change it for a user and change the "from" to "from":"user"
[11:13:09] <ccmonster> and done
[11:13:46] <Bastian_b> Hello
[11:14:17] <ccmonster> hi
[11:14:41] <Bastian_b> I am trying to ask user on a unload evenement but even if I click Cancel from a confirm() message box it unloads the page, here is the code:
[11:14:43] <Bastian_b> http://pastebin.com/eza41wHD
[11:14:54] <Bastian_b> Do you know what is wrong please?
[11:15:57] <gryzzly> ccmonster: seems like I can get away with ".trigger('click', [ true ]);" and in handler .bind('click', function ( e, isAutomatic ) { if ( isAutomatic ) // do stuff } )
[11:16:16] <ccmonster> yea, exactly.
[11:16:27] <ccmonster> you can make it a boolean, or put more data in the event object
[11:16:46] <ccmonster> that way you get around having to handle the .data() stuff on each load, refresh, statechange etc possible.
[11:16:49] <ccmonster> possibly*
[11:17:45] <ccmonster> Bastian_b, ive not messed with the unload event
[11:17:54] <ccmonster> ?demo @ Bastian_b
[11:17:55] <bot-t> Bastian_b, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:19:07] <larsemil> when using .load() can i apply some effects when changing content like $('#id').load(url); if so - how?
[11:20:03] <Bastian_b> I don't how to use your jsfiddle tools...
[11:20:15] <Bastian_b> I click run and nothing happens
[11:21:02] <trave> larsemil : see: api.jquery.com/load ... you will notice that it can take up to 3 arguments, the third argument is a "callback" function, that you could execute whatever you need to.
[11:21:22] <checker> can someone help me with a jquerymobile problem ?
[11:22:28] <Bastian_b> here http://jsfiddle.net/Ggqbz/ and close the page
[11:22:39] <bartmax> help! is there anyway to know which DOM element triggered a submit on ajaxForm() ?
[11:22:43] <trave> larsemil : for example:  $('#foo').load("path to url", [], function(respText) { alert("FOO!";); alert(respText); });
[11:24:12] <larsemil> trave: sure, but then $('#foo') is already updated with the loadcontent
[11:24:22] <larsemil> isnt it?
[11:24:30] <ajpiano> larsemil: you would need to have it hidden first by the default css in the page
[11:25:09] <ajpiano> or hide the container itself, load the stuff in , and then fade the container back in
[11:25:10] <checker> wow can i load also the head area of a second page in jquery mobile
[11:25:35] <bartmax> hi ajpiano, how u doing ... im in crysis :D
[11:25:48] <ajpiano> bartmax: what i always recomend in your situation is
[11:26:08] <ajpiano> you put a click handler on all the buttons that can submit the form
[11:26:27] <ajpiano> in the click handler, you store a a reference to the clicked element on the form itself
[11:26:27] <bartmax> ajpiano: and do ajaxSubmit instead of ajaxForm....
[11:26:28] <ajpiano> and then in the form submit
[11:26:40] <ajpiano> you check what $(this).data("lastClickedElem") is
[11:26:43] <checker> can someone help me with a jquery mobile problem
[11:26:57] <bartmax> ajpiano: i see... much better :)
[11:27:36] <bartmax> something like onclick $('form').data('clickElem', $(this));
[11:27:49] <bartmax> ajpiano: can I save a whole jquery obj on data ?
[11:27:51] <ajpiano> or just 'this'
[11:28:00] <ajpiano> you can save a jquery object, dom element, whatever youw ant
[11:28:03] <bartmax> ok i'll try
[11:28:10] <phlp> you can use this with the regular form submit e.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget
[11:28:47] <Bastian_b> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/Ggqbz/3/     if you close the page or click links it ask you but do nothing
[11:29:58] <bartmax> phlp really?
[11:30:43] <phlp> yep
[11:31:34] <ajpiano> phlp: good call
[11:31:41] <ajpiano> i always forgot where to find that param
[11:31:45] <ajpiano> but i knew it was there somewhere
[11:32:17] <phlp> i forget too. i just console.log(e) when i have to remember :)
[11:32:17] <checker> i need help!please
[11:32:23] <larsemil> trave: when doing like that (leaving second argument as []), i get unsupported method ('post') which i did not get earlier.
[11:32:27] <larsemil> trave: what to do=?
[11:32:51] <checker> i have a little problem with the jquery mobile ui. Can someone help me ??????????
[11:32:54] <ajpiano> don't pass an empty array as a data param just cause someone posts it in sample code demonstrating something else
[11:33:06] <ajpiano> checker: ask a clear question, with perhaps some live code
[11:34:38] <checker> I want to add a big picture on my website and want to add a scrollcontainer. i found a document of jquery api that there is a official way: http://jquerymobile.com/test/experiments/scrollview/scrollview-direction.html
[11:35:14] <checker> but when i add data-scroll="true" or similar tags, nothing happens and no scroll container is coming by
[11:35:52] <ajpiano> checker:  are you sure you're using the most current version of jq mobile
[11:35:59] <checker> yes
[11:37:00] <ajpiano> to be honest, i'm not quite sure
[11:37:04] <ajpiano> have you tried asking in #jquerymobile
[11:37:24] <checker> there is no one aswering
[11:37:41] <checker> answering
[11:38:25] <bartmax>         $this.submit(function (e) {
[11:38:25] <bartmax>             console.log('who', e.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget);
[11:38:25] <bartmax>             e.preventDefault();
[11:38:25] <bartmax>         }); don't work :(
[11:38:51] <kborchers> bartmax: please don't paste code in here
[11:38:55] <bartmax> ok
[11:39:34] <Dirkos> what is the best way to add an A tag around an image?
[11:39:45] <kborchers> ?wrap @ Dirkos
[11:39:45] <bot-t> Dirkos, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/

[11:39:49] <Dirkos> ok thnx
[11:40:09] <checker> @ajpiano do you have any idea ?
[11:40:18] <ajpiano> nope
[11:40:19] <ajpiano> sorry
[11:40:27] <ajpiano> my only suggestion would be to debug inside the jq mobile code
[11:40:36] <ajpiano> and see if it's starting to instantiate the widget etc
[11:40:39] <ajpiano> the scrollable etc
[11:40:42] <ajpiano> but i cna't do that right now, sorry
[11:41:09] <phlp> checker: what browser are you testing it in?
[11:41:18] <checker> iphone safari
[11:42:06] <Bastian_b> Is there a method in jquery to ask user if he really wants to close the browser?
[11:42:10] <kborchers> phlp, bartmax: e.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget is undefined in Chrome

[11:42:33] <Cork[home]> Bastian_b: just listen for the beforeunload event
[11:42:34] <intellilogic> I an new to jquery, I've done some messing around before and got some results.  I am trying to do something a bit trickier, so I typed out the code how I thought it might go, you should be able to see what I am trying to do here, can someone give this a look?  http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/
[11:42:47] <Cork[home]> ?mdc beforeunload @ Bastian_b
[11:42:48] <bot-t> Bastian_b, window.onbeforeunload - MDN Docs - An event that fires before the unload event when the page is unloaded. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[11:43:29] <checker> is there anyone who can help me with my jquery mobile problem? data-scroll="true"
[11:44:19] <Bastian_b> <Cork[home]> perfect thank you !
[11:45:46] <bartmax> going with ajpiano suggestion, should i add data to the form in beforeSubmit or beforeSerialize ?
[11:46:07] <phlp> guess it was too good to be true
[11:46:09] <ajpiano> you have to add it when the button is clicked, not in the submit event, if you do that approach
[11:46:27] <JJMalina> I have a question: I'm toggling some hidden stuff near the bottom of a page. When the hidden stuff appears, the browser automatically scrolls the window to the top of the page. Any way to prevent this?
[11:46:37] <kborchers> checker: you may get more help if you create a fiddle so that people can see what's going on
[11:47:31] <intellilogic> Can someone look at my fiddle?  I am not getting errors, just not results, I am new, I sorta guessed how the code might go:  http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/
[11:47:38] <kborchers> JJMalina: let me guess, the toggle happens when you click a link with href="#"
[11:47:52] <JJMalina> kborchers: yes
[11:48:09] <JJMalina> kborchers: spot on
[11:48:18] <bartmax> ajpiano i add data (the dom element) to the form on click. That element have a name / value that i want to submit on the ajaxSubmit... that should be on data on the ajax call (lets call it ajaxdata) :)
[11:48:19] <bartmax> is that ok ?
[11:48:28] <enjoycrf> any1 know how to center a div inside a div
[11:48:32] <ajpiano> bartmax: you could add that data in on beforeSubmit
[11:48:38] <kborchers> JJMalina: in your click handler that does the toggle, see ?preventDefault
[11:48:39] <bot-t> JJMalina, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/

[11:48:58] <enjoycrf> cause i dun thinks its possible
[11:48:58] <kborchers> np
[11:49:09] <enjoycrf> and its really annoying w variable width buttons
[11:49:11] <bartmax> ajpiano: ok... how can I add an array with the key as the name of the 'element' ? eval() ? i know is evil
[11:49:19] <ajpiano> huh
[11:49:50] <ajpiano> obj[ elem.name ] = elem.value;
[11:50:17] <Cork[home]> bartmax: don't use array for named keys though
[11:50:20] <sean`> hi
[11:50:21] <bartmax> ajpiano duh
[11:50:31] <Cork[home]> use objects ({})
[11:50:32] <bartmax> Cork[home]: ajaxForm uses, had to
[11:50:38] <Cork[home]> ouch
[11:50:52] <Cork[home]> barratt: your sure its really arrays?
[11:51:00] <Cork[home]> *bartmax
[11:51:01] <ajpiano> bartmax: i think for ajax form you'd end up doing foo.push( {name: this.name, value: this.value} )
[11:51:10] <bartmax> ill try
[11:51:21] <ajpiano> Cork[home]: yeah in ajaxForm you get an array of objects with name and value props
[11:51:42] <Cork[home]> ajpiano: ah, well thats fine :=
[11:51:46] <Cork[home]> *:)
[11:52:03] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to detect if an element is "overflown" ?
[11:52:24] <Cork[home]> scrollHeight scrollWidth
[11:52:32] <BillCriswell> Ah, makes sense.
[11:53:21] <intellilogic> I am trying to get the inputs for JUST this TR:  http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/
[11:56:06] <BillCriswell> scrollWidth doesn't seem to exist?
[11:56:21] <BillCriswell> Cork[home]: ^
[11:56:35] <ajpiano> intellilogic: http://jsfiddle.net/VK6dQ/8/
[11:56:45] <Cork[home]> BillCriswell: try .prop('scrollWidth')
[11:57:01] <ajpiano> intellilogic you should a) not be using inline event handlers b) alert doesn't start with a capital A c) instead of manually creating a query string, use jQuery.param on an object that you build
[11:57:32] <kborchers> ajpiano: you're too fast ;) i was almost there
[11:57:39] <checker> so here is my scrollbox problem in a fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/uLL8w/
[11:59:31] <larsemil> what different easings can i use in the $().show(1500,"easing"); ?
[11:59:45] <Cork[home]> ?.effects

[11:59:51] <Cork[home]> sigh
[12:00:06] <BillCriswell> Cork[home]: There it is.
[12:00:37] <Cork[home]> larsemil: http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/
[12:00:49] <Cork[home]> gah... it was at the end >_<
[12:01:16] * Cork[home] should really look closer at url's before expecting them to be wrong...
[12:01:39] <intellilogic> ajpiano:  thanks
[12:02:41] <larsemil> Cork[home]: can i use them with .show somehow? i dont understand really.. :/
[12:03:00] <checker> can someone help me with my jquery mobile scrollbox problem, here you can see the code and see that the scrollbox isnt working : http://jsfiddle.net/uLL8w/
[12:03:41] <Cork[home]> larsemil: the page i was trying to link to has been redirected to api now
[12:03:52] <larsemil> easing string to use for transition. what different are the easings?
[12:04:06] <Cork[home]> larsemil: the the url i intended to send isn't available anymore :/
[12:04:16] <larsemil> okay.
[12:04:37] <Cork[home]> but easing in show is the same as easing in animation
[12:04:50] <Cork[home]> though i don't know of a complete list anymore
[12:05:04] <Cork[home]> *animate
[12:06:17] <Cork[home]> (it used to be on docs.jquery.com, but...)
[12:07:54] <larsemil> has no method easein.. :/ dont get it to work even with those stated on animate
[12:08:40] <Brodingo> ?jquery easing
[12:08:41] <bot-t> Brodingo, Easing Plugin | jQuery Plugins - Allows you to set custom easing types for standard animations. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Easing
[12:09:08] <larsemil> can i steer if it should come from left or right?
[12:09:49] <larsemil> when using linear as show easing?
[12:09:55] <Cork[home]> larsemil: this is the lib it was built from so its farly close http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[12:11:50] <mikedoty> Is there any difference in $(elem).css("z-index", 1) and $(elem).css("zIndex", 1)?
[12:12:02] <mikedoty> For future compatibility is it safer to use one over the other?
[12:12:46] <intellilogic> @ajpiano: I have many forms and tables on the pages I am working on, I want to stick with inline event handlers for this reason.  I as well want to make these functions "genereic" so a simular form/table could use them.  I ma trying to make my way back to inline event handlers, but I am not getting it to work this way:  http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/
[12:13:13] <ajpiano> inline event handlers are terrible
[12:13:23] <ajpiano> everyone has many forms and tables
[12:13:34] <ajpiano> you don't have to use anonymous functions
[12:13:39] <kborchers> ajpiano: maybe not many tables ;)
[12:13:50] <ajpiano> so you could have function doWhatever() and then $("#foo").click(doWhatever)
[12:13:56] <ajpiano> so it's "generic"
[12:14:25] <ajpiano> in otherwords, working *back* to inline event handlers from what i gave you is like saying "oh cool this free house is cool and all but i'm gonna go back to my shack at the garbagedump"
[12:14:51] <intellilogic> @ajpiano: LOL
[12:15:05] <mikedoty> lmao!
[12:15:09] <intellilogic> @ajpiano: but there are going to be other buttons on the same TR that I want to do different actions
[12:15:14] <ajpiano> omg
[12:15:16] <kborchers> ajpiano: do you have a book of amazing analogies you keep next to your keyboard?
[12:15:29] <ajpiano> kborchers: nope, every one is a unique snowflake
[12:15:41] <ajpiano> intellilogic: i fail to see how that necessitates inline handlers
[12:15:43] <kborchers> :D
[12:15:52] <ajpiano> intellilogic: when you do an inline handler, the functoin is invoked in the global scope so this == window
[12:15:55] <ajpiano> not the clicked dom element
[12:16:11] <ajpiano> you have to do JustThisRow(this) and then use the argument in your handler
[12:16:26] <Cork[home]> or use .call
[12:16:36] <Cork[home]> JustThisRow.call(this)
[12:16:36] <ajpiano> lol
[12:16:40] <Cork[home]> :)
[12:16:50] <ajpiano> nothing like mixing call and apply with inline handlers
[12:17:26] <Cork[home]> (note that was a joke)
[12:18:21] <intellilogic> http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/14/
[12:22:26] <larsemil> they always slide from left when using show(), how can i change that?
[12:24:10] <ajpiano> intellilogic: you know why we have the ability to have more than one function in javascript?
[12:24:27] <ajpiano> it's so you don't have to pass flags to inline handlers to tell them what to do
[12:24:44] <ajpiano> (unless they have some kinda common logic, which i can see you're doing here)
[12:27:57] <mbtez> i'm using thickbox with jquery
[12:28:11] <mbtez> i get a javascript error from the line "'a.thickbox, area.thickbox, input.thickbox'", it says, "$ is not a function"
[12:28:18] <mbtez> i understand this is some kind of conflict with/within jquery?
[12:29:04] <mbtez> how do i fix it

[12:29:57] <bot-t> mbtez, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:30:12] <mbtez> yikes
[12:30:40] <Guest9205> Hey guys. Having a wierd bug when i test my site in IE8. When i use $('#elem').load('/my-cool-page'); it works great, but $('#elem').load('/my-cool-page #main'); doesn't work.
[12:31:09] <donburks> Guest9205: That's because /my-cool-page #main is not a valid URL.
[12:31:12] <Guest9205> However $('#elem').load('/my-cool-page #main'); works just fine in all other browsers, so the element obviously excists in this isn't a type or something similar
[12:31:26] <donburks> The other browsers are being forgiving. IE never forgives.
[12:31:35] <donburks> Like my ex-wife.
[12:31:43] <Guest9205> :|
[12:31:51] <Guest9205> How do i get around this?
[12:32:08] <ccmonster> hm, having an issue traversing this object.
[12:32:24] <donburks> Depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Are you trying to load the page /my-cool-page and go to the ID main in the page? Or are you trying to load that into the div main on your current page?
[12:33:08] <Guest9205> I'm trying to load an element from one page into an element on the current page.
[12:33:45] <donburks> Oh, I see.
[12:34:43] <donburks> And have you tried debugging to see what it is sending back?
[12:35:59] <Guest9205> I'm not too familiar with the IE developer tools, but i have them open and tried logging the result. However i only get [object object]Â as a string.
[12:36:14] <orentanay> I'm trying to call a jQuery function from outside of jQuery, but I'm clearly messing it up. Would anyone care to have a good laugh and maybe show me how I'm screwing this up so royally? Thanks. http://pastebin.com/PJZWWEVx
[12:36:34] <Guest9205> In Chrome/Safari i get the little triangle-dropdown thing so i can actually explore the result. And there, everything's just dandy
[12:37:06] <xtrci> Hello guys, whats up ?
[12:38:00] <xtrci> someone give me a hint here? I have 5divs with id's like element-id-1 , element-id-2, element-id-3 etc...
[12:38:29] <xtrci> i would like to make an function that on click removes the div
[12:38:44] <xtrci> how can i know which specific div i want to remove?
[12:39:29] <kborchers> xtrci: that depends on what you are clicking and how your html is structured. see ?demo
[12:39:29] <bot-t> xtrci, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:40:28] <jeffsmykil> is there some sort of jquery-fu that will let me change the origin of a containing div for absolutely positioned elements?
[12:41:39] <Brodingo> theres html and css
[12:41:55] <jeffsmykil> yes but you cant change the origin from 0,0 with those things
[12:43:21] <mbtez> on this page: http://localhost:3001/favorite_rooms
[12:43:26] <mbtez> i can't get thickbox to work... i do not know why
[12:43:28] <mbtez> someone help ?
[12:43:39] <jeffsmykil> i dont have access to your machine
[12:43:47] <mbtez> pretty sure their instructions are followed verbatim..i even called jQuery.noConflict()
[12:43:55] <mbtez> to fix a prototype mismatch thing
[12:44:03] <Guest9205> xtrci something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ahrengot/kzWWH/ ?
[12:44:21] <peol> mbtez: localhost is your own, local machine....
[12:44:26] <mbtez> oh sorry
[12:44:40] <orentanay> I'm trying to call a jQuery function from outside of jQuery, but I'm clearly messing it up. Would anyone care to have a good laugh and maybe show me how I'm screwing this up so royally? Thanks. http://pastebin.com/PJZWWEVx

[12:45:23] <jeffsmykil> orentanay: you never call it
[12:45:34] <enjoycrf> hi
[12:45:37] <jeffsmykil> if you want to call the function it has to be called by an action
[12:45:38] <enjoycrf> can some1 explain
[12:45:48] <enjoycrf> how this friken works
[12:45:54] <enjoycrf> when i do this
[12:46:04] <enjoycrf> function(callback)
[12:46:11] <enjoycrf> i mean
[12:46:30] <enjoycrf> function test(callback) { callback();
[12:46:34] <jeffsmykil> orentanay: either put it in the document ready function or put it in some other action function
[12:46:50] <enjoycrf> and to call it
[12:47:06] <enjoycrf> test(function() { alert(':D')
[12:47:55] <enjoycrf> my initial thot was that i should call it like
[12:48:04] <enjoycrf> eval(callback
[12:48:33] <enjoycrf> because the param callback is already a function
[12:48:41] <enjoycrf> not a function name
[12:48:50] <enjoycrf> js is so weird
[12:49:24] <Guest9205> Is there any way to turn off those *username* joined / quit the channel messages cluttering the chat?
[12:49:40] <ajpiano> use a real IRC client
[12:49:49] <Guest9205> any good one for mac?
[12:49:55] <jeffsmykil> colloquy
[12:49:58] <jeffsmykil> free
[12:49:58] <ajpiano> limechat linkinus colloquy
[12:50:30] <Guest9205> Looks like adium can do the job too.. Cool.
[12:50:35] <enjoycrf> anyone?
[12:50:40] <enjoycrf> callback();
[12:51:00] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: are you asking how "passing a function by reference" works?
[12:51:07] <enjoycrf> yeah
[12:51:11] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: functions are first class objects in javascript
[12:51:22] <ajpiano> they can be passed around like any other type, and can have arbitrary properties etc.
[12:51:38] <enjoycrf> like i have function test(callback) { ...
[12:51:45] <enjoycrf> callback()
[12:51:49] <ajpiano> right
[12:51:52] <enjoycrf> and it works
[12:51:54] <ajpiano> it works because you passed a function reference
[12:51:59] <ajpiano> and that's how the language works
[12:52:07] <enjoycrf> but its not a name
[12:52:09] <enjoycrf> its a function
[12:52:11] <ajpiano> it's a function
[12:52:14] <enjoycrf> its not $callback();
[12:52:15] <ajpiano> ...
[12:52:16] <enjoycrf> like php
[12:52:26] <enjoycrf> ya its a function() {}
[12:52:28] <juha_> man
[12:52:29] <ajpiano> ....
[12:52:38] <enjoycrf> a function thats a param
[12:52:38] <juha_> it's hard to steal swat car in gta
[12:52:39] <ajpiano> it's an instance of Function.prototype
[12:53:02] <shaft0> Can anyone tell me why the $('a.homesMore').click() function on this page isn't doing anything?  http://www.citycore.creationrepublic.com/homes
[12:53:11] <enjoycrf> it must be coded to run it as function at runtime
[12:53:20] <ajpiano> it's an object like any other javascript object that can be passed to any other thing and then have it's native functionality
[12:53:44] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: when it is invoked, javascript finds out if it's a function or not
[12:53:50] <ajpiano> if it isn't, it throws an exception
[12:53:51] <enjoycrf> ok yeah
[12:53:57] <ajpiano> that's why you get "x is not a function" errors
[12:54:02] <shaft0> It should be revealing a div (sliding out), but it just sits there.  I don't get any errors, but I don't get any result either, and I can't for the life of my figure out why.
[12:54:15] <ajpiano> because it's doing like, some.undefined.thing();
[12:54:23] <mbtez> no one can help ? :(
[12:54:24] <ajpiano> and undefined is not a function, so ... it is not a function
[12:54:46] <Alqounkiz> guys
[12:55:06] <Alqounkiz> my firefox console is saying $ is not defined
[12:55:09] <Alqounkiz> when i do
[12:55:09] <Alqounkiz> $('#minimize-button').click(function(){
[12:55:10] <jeffsmykil> shaft0:  where?
[12:56:19] <Rushing> Alqounkiz, see if jQuery is defined
[12:56:26] <Rushing> jQuery('#minimiz...
[12:56:26] <Alqounkiz> i fixed my issue
[12:56:34] <Rushing> no i did.
[12:56:36] <Alqounkiz> i put the script tag that loads it in the head
[12:56:42] <Alqounkiz> rather than on the bottom
[12:56:58] <Rushing> yeah, i don't like this whole trend of loading js resources at the bottom of the page
[12:57:04] <Alqounkiz> :/
[12:57:08] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: If you click one of the pictures, a div shows up that says "home info / pictures", but then if you click that, nothing happens.
[12:57:16] <Alqounkiz> how do i check if an element is display: none?
[12:57:18] <Alqounkiz> aka invisible
[12:57:31] <Rushing> $("#something").is(":visible")
[12:57:51] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: and I can't figure out as to why it's not doing what it's supposed to (revealing hidden info in that div)
[12:58:03] <enjoycrf> $ = jQuery.noConflict();
[12:58:04] <enjoycrf> put that right above that line
[12:58:23] <necromancer> is there a way i can manipulate the :hover state of an <a> using jQuery?
[12:58:31] <necromancer> (with .css(), i guess)
[12:58:55] <Rushing> $("a.mine").hover(function(){ $(this).css({...}); });
[12:59:03] <jeffsmykil> there is no homesmore click function shaft0
[12:59:28] <Rushing> necromancer, but i'd prefer to just addClass() and control the hover from the css
[12:59:41] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: it's at the bottom
[13:00:12] <jeffsmykil> oh there it is
[13:00:19] <illyCoffee84> hello
[13:00:46] <shaft0> starting at line 118
[13:00:53] <illyCoffee84> could somebody explain me what's wrong with my callback function please?
[13:00:54] <enjoycrf> dood stop doing css w js
[13:00:56] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: did you try sending the click from the console?
[13:00:57] <enjoycrf> or html
[13:01:00] <illyCoffee84> http://jsfiddle.net/9eGT6/
[13:01:07] <enjoycrf> stop writing html w js
[13:01:10] <enjoycrf> seriously
[13:01:28] <Alqounkiz> guys why do some internet articles suggest loading jquery from google and then loading it locally if loading from google fails
[13:01:30] <enjoycrf> then ppl have to erase all ur stuff
[13:01:34] <Alqounkiz> isn't it just plain faster to just load it locally
[13:01:35] <Rushing> anjoycrf, who are you talking to?
[13:01:41] <enjoycrf> everyone
[13:02:02] <enjoycrf> why would u hit google to load something on ur site
[13:02:03] <enjoycrf> ?
[13:02:13] <enjoycrf> stop this insanity
[13:02:14] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: my guess is somethings covering it
[13:02:16] <Alqounkiz> i have no idea
[13:02:19] <ajpiano> cause the user's cache might be primed
[13:02:23] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: if you call the click from the console it breaks
[13:02:28] <Ahrengot1> Anyone using IE 8 out there. I need to figure out if it's just my copy that's messings things up.
[13:02:31] <ajpiano> that's the idea of using the shared cdn hosting
[13:02:33] <enjoycrf> then put a ?random=1
[13:02:44] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: you *want* to get the cached version
[13:02:47] <Rushing> Alqounkiz, ingore it. it's about as useful as loading your js last
[13:02:54] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: how do I do that?  Are you using Firebug?
[13:02:56] <ajpiano> have you really never heard of CDN-loading of libraries?
[13:03:01] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[13:03:02] <Alqounkiz> im trying to figure out why this article is in existance
[13:03:02] <Alqounkiz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-goo
[13:03:12] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: $(".homesMore").click()
[13:03:14] <Alqounkiz> so i shouldn't load employ this 'strategy;?
[13:03:20] <shaft0> haha that would make sense
[13:03:35] <Rushing> Alqounkiz, i prefer not to. it's really not necessary at all
[13:03:35] <ajpiano> Alqounkiz: because there are CDNs to load jQuery... opinions are mixed as to whether using them is worth it
[13:03:42] <enjoycrf> that rediculus
[13:03:50] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: make sure its not covered by anything
[13:03:56] <Rushing> enjoycrf, it would be most useful on something like a mobile phone or 56k
[13:04:01] <jeffsmykil> give it like a margin of 100px and try clicking it again
[13:04:05] <Alqounkiz> screw that, im just gonna load my stuff locally, and in my head tag
[13:04:07] <FruitBasket> The test interface, how does it handle things like ajax? It's asynchronous, so the test function will return before the end of the test.. is the test still open until the next call to test() ?
[13:04:14] <Alqounkiz> all i need to do is minify
[13:04:15] <ajpiano> Alqounkiz don't do it in your HEAD tag
[13:04:22] <Alqounkiz> where then
[13:04:29] <enjoycrf> yeah in ur head tag
[13:04:30] <Rushing> yes, do it in your head tag
[13:04:35] * Rushing puts up fists
[13:04:38] <ajpiano> FruitBasket: there are stop() and start() functions to work around async behaviour in QUnit
[13:04:38] <Alqounkiz> -.- what do i do
[13:04:42] <ajpiano> what the hell
[13:04:49] <ajpiano> javascript goes at the bottom of the body, it's 2011 guys
[13:04:51] <enjoycrf> ull figure it out
[13:04:55] <enjoycrf> some things go in head
[13:04:56] <Adman65> can you have to different things bound to popState ?
[13:04:57] <FruitBasket> ajpiano: ah. Thanks.
[13:05:04] <enjoycrf> some things go right before end body
[13:05:06] <Rushing> ajpiano, i don't think it's valid...let's talk lol
[13:05:09] <ajpiano> most things don't
[13:05:12] <Rushing> i've yet to be convinced of why we need to do this
[13:05:18] <Adman65> i have two sliders pushing states on, but can't distinguish between the two pop state events
[13:05:19] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: weird, when I send the click command, it works...
[13:05:22] <Alqounkiz> im just gonna put it in the head
[13:05:28] <ajpiano> loading scripts in the head of the page blocks the rest of the page from loading and leads to a less responsive experience
[13:05:37] <Rushing> would you serve your partial html and then do server side scripting? no. js is that essential to the html now, so i think it should be loaded first
[13:05:39] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: its probably covered by another element, try a margin top on the link and try again
[13:05:43] <enjoycrf> some things need to go in $.ready
[13:05:49] <enjoycrf> ull figure it out
[13:05:56] <Rushing> ajpiano, not after it's cached, and who cares how responsive the experience is if it's not ready?
[13:06:25] <ajpiano> steve souders does
[13:06:26] <ajpiano> http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/12/06/evolution-of-script-loading/
[13:06:27] <enjoycrf> ok here is a quastion
[13:06:54] <ajpiano> Rushing: users
[13:06:59] <ajpiano> :p
[13:07:00] <enjoycrf> would u guys rather do $().onlick{ stuff }
[13:07:02] <enjoycrf> or
[13:07:08] <enjoycrf> a href="stuff()"
[13:07:17] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: I put the z-index at 75 and tried different margins with no luck, what in the hell hahaha
[13:07:22] <necromancer> $('a').click(stuff);
[13:07:25] <insign> What web hosting service do you recommend that offers options to enhance the features at any time and has good prices?
[13:07:33] <Alqounkiz> enjoycrf: .onclick() and put # in the href?
[13:07:39] <necromancer> enjoycrf: if you pass a single argument (e) into your function you can just do that.
[13:07:45] <jeffsmykil> try z-index like 1000000000
[13:07:47] <Rushing> ajpiano, i'm not arguing that it's widely practiced, i'm just saying i really don't agree that js resources aren't as essential as the html itself, and if a browser doesn't support js, it doesn't make a difference
[13:07:48] <jeffsmykil> shaft0:
[13:07:48] <enjoycrf> i know
[13:07:53] <necromancer> so like $('a').click(myClick); function myClick(e) { ... }
[13:07:55] <enjoycrf> the .click
[13:08:00] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: try an absurd z-index like 10000000
[13:08:06] <enjoycrf> has bubbling issues tho
[13:08:15] <Rushing> i'd rather a little longer of a loading time than a really bad FOUC
[13:08:15] <necromancer> enjoycrf: e.preventDefault();
[13:08:15] <enjoycrf> and its annoying to deal with
[13:08:16] <ajpiano> Rushing: but the point is, some soft "feeling" that js "should" be loaded first if it is essential isn't meted out by the real world
[13:08:21] <FruitBasket> ajpiano: the docs suck.. do I stop() before an asynchronous portion and start() after that portion returns?
[13:08:22] <enjoycrf> no not that
[13:08:24] <illyCoffee84> how can i make a callback inside a click event?
[13:08:24] <ajpiano> because you still get a faster pageload
[13:08:29] <ajpiano> if you load that essential JS at the bottom of the body
[13:08:29] <necromancer> what do you mean by "bubbling", enjoycrf
[13:08:33] <ajpiano> FruitBasket: yep
[13:08:36] <enjoycrf> u cant do .click
[13:08:37] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: nothing...
[13:08:38] <FruitBasket> ajpiano: thanks.
[13:08:42] <shaft0> it's like 999999999 z-index.
[13:08:46] <enjoycrf> before the .click is made tho
[13:08:52] <enjoycrf> so u have to do
[13:08:52] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: hold on
[13:09:04] <enjoycrf> oncomplete function { .onlick
[13:09:06] <enjoycrf> see
[13:09:09] <ajpiano> dude
[13:09:11] <ajpiano> it's not "onclick"
[13:09:12] <enjoycrf> that gets out of control
[13:09:14] <ajpiano> it's click
[13:09:16] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: yeah
[13:09:20] <ajpiano> you use .delegate or .live for that
[13:09:30] <necromancer> Rushing: blind people/screen readers don't use JS
[13:09:38] <necromancer> which is why semantic HTML was developed
[13:09:39] <enjoycrf> wtf is .live
[13:09:50] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: when did you start using jquery?
[13:09:59] <enjoycrf> 4 yrs?
[13:10:05] <necromancer> haha wow
[13:10:05] <ajpiano> copping attitude about two and a half year old APIs is kind of like hilarious
[13:10:09] <necromancer> are you serious?
[13:10:16] <ajpiano> live has been there since 1.4
[13:10:21] <ajpiano> i mean 1.3
[13:10:25] <ajpiano> and better support in 1.4
[13:10:28] <enjoycrf> how old is jquery
[13:10:38] <ajpiano> it was createad in like 2005 originally
[13:10:50] <enjoycrf> so what does live do
[13:10:58] <ajpiano> it's an abstraction for event delegation
[13:11:15] <enjoycrf> .click wont work unless the element clicking exists
[13:11:31] <Rushing> necromancer, i understand that, but i don't think we should prime our site for the experience of 1%...
[13:11:35] <enjoycrf> so if u try to click pagenumbers
[13:11:48] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: read this and the next few slides after it http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide23
[13:11:50] <enjoycrf> when u go to the next page
[13:11:56] <enjoycrf> .click wont work
[13:12:13] <enjoycrf> because ur div.html was replaced
[13:12:27] <necromancer> enjoycrf: yeah that's why live & delegate were developed...
[13:12:30] <enjoycrf> and now .click went w the old div html
[13:12:49] <enjoycrf> gah really?
[13:12:56] <jeffsmykil> enjoycrf: are you a loud person irl?
[13:13:07] <enjoycrf> am i stupido
[13:13:23] <illyCoffee84> can somebody give me a hand with this code?
[13:13:25] <Rushing> i think there's some interesting arguments around it, i just think speeding up a *fully rendered* page load by .02 isn't worth loading your resources out of order
[13:13:34] <enjoycrf> ive never seen any1 use .lice
[13:13:36] <enjoycrf> live
[13:13:44] <jeffsmykil> i used it
[13:13:45] <enjoycrf> and ive seen lots of coed
[13:13:47] <jeffsmykil> use it
[13:13:50] <Rushing> enjoycrf, it's very common
[13:13:56] <illyCoffee84> $("#hd1").click(function() {
[13:13:56] <illyCoffee84>     $("#hd2").click(function(){alert('hola');});
[13:13:56] <illyCoffee84> });
[13:14:26] <enjoycrf> show me an example
[13:14:33] <enjoycrf> live and click
[13:14:44] <Rushing> ?live @ enjoycrf
[13:14:44] <bot-t> enjoycrf, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:14:46] <jeffsmykil> dude your obnoxious
[13:14:51] <jeffsmykil> i use it for popups
[13:14:55] <jeffsmykil> if there is a link in one
[13:14:55] <Alqounkiz> ok so guys, is this the best way to load jquery
[13:14:55] <Alqounkiz> http://pastebin.com/ZUzbEfrF
[13:14:55] <jeffsmykil> an
[13:15:35] <Alqounkiz> ??
[13:15:36] <peol> Alqounkiz: a <script> tag will always do
[13:15:42] <Rushing> Alqounkiz, i think you're getting too caught up in this
[13:15:44] <peol> with src=""
[13:15:46] <Rushing> just load it as you normally would
[13:15:56] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: any luck?
[13:16:04] <Alqounkiz> im just trying to get this effeciancy/speed issue over with
[13:16:10] <jeffsmykil> no your site locked my browser up so i stopped trying
[13:16:33] <Rushing> it will be VERY minimal Alqounkiz, and probably cause more trouble than it's worth, unless you're on a gigantic site with gigantic amounts of traffic
[13:16:42] <shaft0> hahaha are you serious?  oohhhhh man.  *shakes head*
[13:16:43] <Alqounkiz> :/
[13:16:50] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: sorry
[13:16:55] <jeffsmykil> you know the code is good
[13:16:59] <jeffsmykil> it must be something in your html
[13:17:20] <shaft0> jeffsmykil: hey no worries, you gave it a shot and I appreciate that, not your job to be cleaning up noob messes haha
[13:17:53] <jeffsmykil> god knows ajpiano  has cleaned up enough of mine, just trying to pay it forward
[13:17:58] <ajpiano> :D
[13:18:02] <jeffsmykil> shaft0:  it has to be in your html though
[13:19:17] <necromancer> Rushing: honestly, for most applications it's not necessary at all
[13:20:18] <Rushing> yeah, i'd say 99.9%, and if that's the only problem you have with your site, you've done well
[13:20:22] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano that midget stripper I sent you come yet?
[13:20:26] <Alqounkiz> guys, my click event is having no effect
[13:20:28] <Alqounkiz> http://pastebin.com/eHmrZcw8
[13:20:34] <Alqounkiz> is anything wrong
[13:21:20] <Rushing> i think it's an interesting technique and has some validity, but i think it can have as many or more cons to loading them in the head tag
[13:22:33] <Rushing> kinda like how image preloader scripts were so popular back in 2000...how many do you see now?
[13:23:49] <Jon47> my boss made me make one just last week!
[13:24:12] <Jon47> but yeah, you don't see that shit around much these days cause everyone's got 35Mbps down and shit
[13:24:32] <jeffsmykil> that was an impressive display of the word shit Jon47
[13:24:34] <necromancer> Rushing: you don't need them now thanks to CSS 2.1 and background-position
[13:24:58] <Jon47> i'm going to register 35Mbpsdownandshit dot com
[13:25:04] <Rushing> right right, but do you use preloading for all images that don't use sprites?
[13:25:27] <necromancer> no. but i didn't use preloading for images that didn't need it before, either
[13:25:36] <necromancer> i would preload for hover-images
[13:25:37] <Ahrengot1> Does anyone running IE8 get any error when clicking the "archive" tab on http://ahrengot.com/ ?
[13:25:43] <necromancer> i would preload hovering images* :)
[13:25:44] <Rushing> right
[13:26:16] <necromancer> it's funny that we're even more concerned with speed now than we were 15 years ago...and nowadays speed is not as much of an issue
[13:26:41] <Rushing> Ahrengot1, if it closes your tab, it's a problem with winxp and jquery 1.6.2. i've run into it on 2 of my sites now
[13:26:58] <Rushing> downgrade to 1.6.1
[13:27:16] <Rushing> necromancer, exactly :P
[13:27:37] <Rushing> the people we're developing rich experiences for are not on analog phones and IE5
[13:27:57] <Ahrengot1> Thanks Rushing,but if it's a problem with WinXP shouldn't that affect Firefox too?
[13:27:58] <Rushing> with 56k
[13:28:17] <Rushing> no, it's really a problem with IE, but it only happens in winxp
[13:28:22] <Rushing> that i know of
[13:29:00] <Ahrengot1> Oh okay. I'll try downgrading. Thanks
[13:29:05] <Rushing> np
[13:29:35] <Alqounkiz> guys is the type attribute in a script tag neccessary for ie
[13:30:02] <Rushing> no, DUDE. stop sweating this small stuff
[13:30:15] <Rushing> it's inconsiquential
[13:30:20] <Rushing> mostly ;P
[13:30:32] <jeffsmykil> was that a reference to my penis>? because if it was i do not appreciate it
[13:30:35] <Rushing> just focus on clean code and good markup
[13:30:52] <shaft0> jeffsmukil:  I've checked over my HTML, I seriously can't find a thing.  Ah well, I'll figure it out at some point.
[13:31:12] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: sometimes if you walk away when you come back you are like "D'oh"
[13:31:36] <jeffsmykil> shaft0: when stuff doesnt work, simplify
[13:32:37] <caaakeeey> hey, does anyone know of a syntax highlighter library for js hat lets you choose the colours dynamically?
[13:32:48] <jeffsmykil> dynamically?
[13:32:55] <jeffsmykil> notepad++ maybe?
[13:33:09] <caaakeeey> thats not js...
[13:33:22] <jeffsmykil> it does syntax highlighting doesnt it?
[13:33:27] <caaakeeey> dynamically being i can select the colours by typing them into a box or something
[13:33:37] <caaakeeey> not just using default inbuilt styles
[13:33:48] <caaakeeey> as in its written in js
[13:33:49] <jeffsmykil> yeah notepad++ does that
[13:33:59] <caaakeeey> so the highlighted text can display in a broser
[13:34:05] <jeffsmykil> oh
[13:34:07] <caaakeeey> browser
[13:34:19] <Rushing> no, you have to use a marker for that
[13:34:36] <Rushing> just beware of the black sharpie if you're a black background kinda guy
[13:34:40] <jeffsmykil> i would be so screwed the boss would make me use a crt if i did that
[13:34:58] <caaakeeey> a marker?
[13:35:36] <Rushing> yeah, crayola might be ok, but you'd be rockin' with some dry-erase markers
[13:36:00] <Rushing> caaakeeey, in case you don't nkow that i'm kidding, just google javascript syntax highlighting
[13:36:17] <caaakeeey> crayola.js? i cant find it
[13:36:22] * jeffsmykil stops drawing on his screen... kidding?
[13:36:28] <caaakeeey> is dry erase a plugin?
[13:36:30] <Rushing> man -_-
[13:36:51] <Rushing> http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/
[13:37:04] <Rushing> you can provide custom CSS to change the colors to what you want
[13:38:09] <caaakeeey> is css a pen brand?
[13:38:17] <caaakeeey> why would i need custom pens
[13:39:02] <Rushing> O_o i can't get a read on you...
[13:39:50] <mbtez> how do i test if a script like thickbox is running?
[13:39:56] <mbtez> something that monitors an element for a .click event?
[13:40:02] <mbtez> in jquery?
[13:40:07] <caaakeeey> please don't
[13:40:12] <Rushing> what do you mean "running"
[13:40:13] <caaakeeey> i dont like my privacy invaded
[13:40:19] <Rushing> you want to see if that plugin is available?
[13:43:56] <mbtez> no
[13:43:58] <mbtez> running on my page
[13:44:05] <mbtez> the script isn't working... i have zero idea why
[13:44:15] <mbtez> all the installation instructions have been followed
[13:44:18] <bamccaig> Does jQuery modify jQuery.fn.custom at run-time or can you rely on jQuery.fn.custom being your function object?
[13:44:37] <bamccaig> Assuming 'custom' is a custom function, of course...
[13:45:01] <Rushing> bamccaig, assuming "custom" is not overwritten by another plugin
[13:45:23] <Rushing> and make sure you're not including jquery again somewhere after the plugin has been created
[13:45:33] <bamccaig> Right. I just wanted to modularize this really ugly custom function a bit without litering the global namespace (or cluttering the function itself).
[13:45:50] <Rushing> you should be safe
[13:46:00] <bamccaig> So right after setting jQuery.fn.custom I also set jQuery.fn.custom.part1 and jQuery.fn.custom.part2.
[13:46:13] <David_Bradbury> So I have this sort of set-up, except with images - http://jsfiddle.net/khTAS/  - After the first time it runs though, the first image in the list sticks in place with a left value of 0, while the others move past it
[13:46:15] <David_Bradbury> any ideas?
[13:46:35] <Rushing> bamccaig, yes that'll work, but realize that the scope of part1 and part2 will not be the jquery element
[13:47:06] <Rushing> unless you call them that way var $thing = $("#thing"); $thing.custom.part1.call($thing, arg1, arg2, etc);
[13:48:05] <bamccaig> Rushing: Yes, I know. The function is calling serializeArray() and then using each() to iterate over the result. These functions are called within the each() callback.
[13:48:20] <bamccaig> I didn't write the function... >_< I'm just adding to it... >_>
[13:48:44] <Rushing> ok, then yes, you can count on $.fn.custom.part1 being there for you
[13:49:00] <Rushing> again, assuming jquery and custom are not redefined for whatever reason, after you have defined part1
[13:49:17] <Rushing> i've got to "bounce"
[13:49:27] <Rushing> y'all have a good'n
[13:49:32] <bamccaig> Though if that were the case then jQuery.fn.custom would never call jQuery.fn.custom.part1 anyway. ^_^
[13:49:37] <bamccaig> Thanks. o/
[13:50:03] <sphinxxx> how do you delay before doing fadeout?
[13:50:16] <sphinxxx> delay 4 seconds before starting a fadeout, or fadein
[13:50:21] <bamccaig> sphinxxx: Use a timeout?
[13:50:26] <mbtez> what's a lightweight v ersion of thickbox?
[13:50:28] <mbtez> very lightweight
[13:50:32] <mbtez> click an image, have a nice div pop up
[13:50:33] <jeffsmykil> theres a better way i cant remember how Badababuba
[13:50:34] <jeffsmykil> bac
[13:50:35] <TrevorBradley> Hey folks, I'm trying to get this fellows jquery mobile "swipeup"/"swipedown" events working, but the functions don't appear to be defined when I run this.  Any quick ideas what might be wrong?  http://developingwithstyle.blogspot.com/search/label/swipe
[13:50:52] <monokrome> jeffsebring: jQuery.delay
[13:51:17] <jeffsmykil> monokrome:  thats the one!
[13:51:32] <monokrome> $('.something').delay(500).fadeIn();
[13:51:36] <TrevorBradley> i.e., if I have $("body").swipeup(function() { alert("hi");}); ... I get a "swipeup is not defined error"
[13:51:54] <jeffsmykil> sounds like its not a function TrevorBradley
[13:52:06] <jeffsmykil> are you sure jquery mobile is included
[13:52:47] <TrevorBradley> Yup, jeffsmykil, I'm using swipeleft/swiperight just fine.
[13:53:07] <jeffsmykil> i dont know the functions in that library
[13:53:17] <jeffsmykil> maybe its not called swupeup
[13:53:23] <mbtez> how do i test whether or not a function is executing
[13:53:24] <mbtez> in firefox
[13:53:27] <TrevorBradley> It certainly doesn't behave like a function... Is there a primer on creating DOM functions so I can work backwards on the problem?
[13:53:31] <mbtez> like
[13:53:32] <supsup> i just made a form with 300 inputs i'm thinking this is prob wrong idea there ~~
[13:53:38] <jeffsmykil> mbtez put a console.log in it
[13:53:43] <David_Bradbury> http://seats3d.com/temp/seats3d_upgrade/index.php - Any ideas why after the bar at the bottom loops a couple times, one of the images stick?
[13:53:44] <mbtez> $("body").append
[13:53:54] <TrevorBradley> e.g. $("#mydiv").myfunction... where the css is changed
[13:54:08] <jeffsmykil> TrevorBradley: I think there is a jquery mobile IRC room
[13:54:09] <mbtez> how am i supposed to read that
[13:54:13] <jeffsmykil> they could probably help you better
[13:54:20] <m4xx> anyone know why this returns 0 instead of 9 on the second alert? http://jsfiddle.net/rDvpZ/
[13:54:24] <mbtez> it's not in the firebug console :O
[13:54:32] <bricker1> Are there any good jquery solutions for a "grid" for updating multiple attributes of multiple records at once? Like a check-list sort of, but for multiple records. Each user has several steps that they need to complete, and I'd like to be able to check off multiple steps for multiple users all in one form
[13:54:48] <Ahrengot1> I Can't, for the life of me, figure out why IE 8 throws an 'Object doesn't support this method' error when infinite scroll is fired(scroll to the bottom) on http://ahrengot.com/blog/ Any pointers?
[13:55:00] <TrevorBradley> True... Still, I suspect it's broken jquery.... the functions don't even exist.  How would I create a "myfunction" that would affect all DOM objects of a certain class, for instance?
[13:55:09] <bricker1> I looked the Grid plugin, I'm sure I could modify it to suit my needs, but I'm wondering if there's anything more like what I'm looking for
[13:55:10] <sphinxxx> i have this code but the fadeout is happening right away, not waiting 3 sec:  setTimeout($popup.fadeOut("slow"),3000);
[13:55:12] * TrevorBradley also goes to look for jquerymobile
[13:55:13] <a|3x> hi
[13:55:33] <mbtez> my script is making 71 calls to historyCheck in jquery O_O
[13:55:38] <mbtez> wtf
[13:56:17] <mbtez> is that how jquery checks for click events and such
[13:56:25] <monokrome> no
[13:56:33] <David_Bradbury> http://seats3d.com/temp/seats3d_upgrade/index.php - Any ideas why after the bar at the bottom loops a couple times, one of the images stick?
[13:59:22] <mbtez> i have zero idea what's happening
[14:00:21] <David_Bradbury> It seems like every loop or so, one link/image isn't getting 'grabbed'
[14:01:05] <supsup> m4xx :  http://jsfiddle.net/rDvpZ/1/ classic problem u gotta pass 2nd param
[14:01:27] <supsup> i think i learned that one from Crockford
[14:01:54] <TrevorBradley> the #jquerymobile channel is pretty dead. :)
[14:01:55] <orentanay> in jQuery, what would this select? $()
[14:01:57] <supsup> radix is 8 by default or something
[14:02:23] <Narad> I'm scking with one problem for hours now. I would really appreciate if someone would help me to solve my problem. I generate an ul-li-divs hierarchy from json data, and after I ask for updates with a loop. Every json update contains which ul, which li, and which div in it should be updated with what. How can I write the select for that?
[14:02:28] <m4xx> sorry i should have posted my answer, Ratty_ in  ##javascript informed me ;]
[14:02:35] <m4xx> supsup thank you =]
[14:02:39] <supsup> word up
[14:03:37] <Narad> I tried smg like this: $("#" + data[i].resource + " > #" + data[i].key + " > div[name=" + key + "]").html("1");
[14:06:10] <David_Bradbury> Anybody else with decent jQuery knowledge have an idea what's up?
[14:06:41] <tbranyen> i have indecent knowledge
[14:06:44] <tbranyen> if you know what i mean
[14:06:50] <snover> I sure do little buddy.
[14:06:59] <tbranyen> :3
[14:08:27] <David_Bradbury> hah
[14:08:31] <David_Bradbury> Well - http://seats3d.com/temp/seats3d_upgrade/index.php - Any ideas why after the bar at the bottom loops a couple times, one of the images stick?
[14:10:15] <David_Bradbury> It's inconsistent too. I've refreshed it a number of times and it chooses a different icon
[14:11:32] <Narad> I cant believe that noone can help :D 899 in this channel, and no ppl ever had any issue like mine? :D
[14:13:44] <magicbronson> when something hides the html element, does it trigger an event you can listen for (and attach a handler to show it again)?
[14:13:58] <patrick99e99> is there any way to make a native select
[14:14:02] <patrick99e99> aaah
[14:14:03] <patrick99e99> sorry
[14:14:20] <patrick99e99> is there any way to make a native select's options visible by default (as if it's been clicked)
[14:29:59] <Ned_> when returning false from an event handler, that prevents default? or stops propagation?
[14:30:04] <Ned_> (I can't find this in the API docs) :/
[14:30:20] <phlp> both
[14:30:30] <Ned_> phlp: do you know where it says that in the docs ?
[14:30:51] <snover> Ned_: the place where it says you can return false to prevent default and stop propagation.
[14:30:52] <snover> :)
[14:31:00] <Ned_> snover: how very ... meta
[14:31:15] <Ned_> can you do a link ?
[14:31:15] <Ned_> ;-)
[14:32:40] <David_Bradbury> Is there any reason that some $('div a') would select all the elements except the first one?
[14:32:56] <David_Bradbury> Or should I say $("#foo a")
[14:33:10] <snover> ?lmgtfy return false site:api.jquery.com @ Ned_
[14:33:11] <bot-t> Ned_, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=return+false+site:api.jquery.com
[14:33:13] <Ned_> David_Bradbury: err, no, there's no such reason :p
[14:33:27] <David_Bradbury> Because that is happening for some reason with me :p
[14:33:34] <snover> you donâ€™t even have to visit the site because it shows up *in the summary*
[14:33:37] <Ned_> David_Bradbury: pastebot ?
[14:33:46] <Ned_> snover: indeed
[14:33:48] <phlp> Ned_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L436
[14:33:49] <David_Bradbury> http://192.100.100.102/temp/seats3d_upgrade/srms.php - check the bottom slider after one loop
[14:34:00] <Ned_> snover: I was reading the "Events" => "Binding Events" section
[14:34:01] <Ned_> :p
[14:34:05] <David_Bradbury> or two loops
[14:34:07] <Ned_> clearly wasn't helping :-(
[14:34:15] <chubicle> hey guys, i'm learning front end development stuff, and my coworker just gave me a spring app, how do i use jquery to replace the ui?
[14:34:25] <Ned_> David_Bradbury: that's a private IP isn't it ?
[14:34:30] <David_Bradbury> haha whoop-s
[14:34:42] <David_Bradbury> http://seats3d.com/temp/seats3d_upgrade/seats3d.php
[14:35:05] <David_Bradbury> My bad
[14:36:00] <Ned_> David_Bradbury: not quite sure what I'm looking at ...
[14:36:07] <Ned_> oh, there's a stuck image ?
[14:36:13] <David_Bradbury> Watch the bottom slider and there is a stuck iamge
[14:36:15] <David_Bradbury> yup
[14:36:17] <David_Bradbury> image*
[14:36:24] <David_Bradbury> It happens once the animation calls itself
[14:36:39] <David_Bradbury> I clear the queue, stop the animation, and the restart it
[14:36:40] <Ned_> well, I can't see the code ...
[14:37:17] <David_Bradbury> http://seats3d.com/temp/seats3d_upgrade/js/index.js near the bottom
[14:37:21] <Ned_> David_Bradbury: if I use the console
[14:37:24] <Ned_> and make a selector
[14:37:27] <Ned_> it gets them all fine
[14:37:34] <Ned_> so I suspect there's something else wrong with your code
[14:37:45] <chubicle> hey guys, i'm learning front end development stuff, and my coworker just gave me a spring app, how do i use jquery to replace the ui?
[14:38:00] <TrevorBradley> Got it... jQuery mobile requires the use of .live or .bind to call those swipeup/swipedown functions.
[14:38:04] <David_Bradbury> That's what I'm not sure of. It isn't grabbing the first one for some reason
[14:38:23] <David_Bradbury> Or it is grabbing it and sticking it at 0px left
[14:44:23] <murz> i have a question about jquery-tmpl
[14:44:44] <murz> im trying to print out a string that looks something like this: <script type='text/javascript'> var foo = "bar"; </script>
[14:45:04] <murz> but even with the {{ html }} template tag, the quotes get escaped
[14:59:02] <sanity> if I do something like: var a = $("a[href]").attr("href") - what will 'a' be if the selector returns no elements, and how do i test for that?
[15:01:40] <crankharder> say I have a list of image srcs, and I want to preload the image data so that the browser doesn't have to fetch it later.  is load(src) sufficient?
[15:02:17] <phlp> sanity: $("a[href]").length
[15:02:20] <crankharder> i dont need to stuff the image anywhere, really just want the browser to cache it
[15:02:43] <sanity> phlp: is it possible to do it without 2 selector calls?
[15:03:31] <phlp> var a = $("a[href]"); if (a.length) { a.attr or whatever }
[15:03:43] <sanity> phlp: got it, thanks
[15:07:28] <supsup> David_Bradbury fix this up and prob someone can help u out.   http://jsfiddle.net/Kz8q5/1/
[15:08:11] <David_Bradbury> Oh wow, thanks
[15:09:11] <supsup> yah kinda confused u can see what ur talking about but i think i lost some of ur stuff
[15:09:24] <supsup> so fix example like that with pure prroblem
[15:09:29] <supsup> then ask question
[15:09:34] <supsup> hard to read over page doing a lot of stuff
[15:11:04] <supsup> that is interesting recursive call tho with animation ~~
[15:11:23] <David_Bradbury> Kk, cleaning it up :p
[15:14:56] <David_Bradbury> http://jsfiddle.net/PpkpY/
[15:15:04] <David_Bradbury> That should be a bit more clean
[15:19:04] <supsup> its definatly that one line that causes it:  $("#logo-slider-body a").css({  but yah unsure why
[15:19:25] <supsup> if u set that to neg # it goes away but then does janky stuff
[15:19:26] <Adman65> is there some way I can track the history stack when using pushstate/popstate
[15:20:59] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/PpkpY/4/  -- sorta works but animation slows down kinda funny unsure why it would.
[15:21:08] <supsup> when u reset
[15:21:14] <supsup> i lowered delay for testing
[15:21:42] <supsup> that slowdown is a feature that's it
[15:23:05] <David_Bradbury> I know what it is doing the slow down
[15:23:25] <David_Bradbury> oooo, what did you change?
[15:23:46] <supsup> $("#logo-slider-body a").css({       left: -1 * logo_width     });  instead of 0
[15:24:33] <David_Bradbury> Interesting
[15:24:36] <David_Bradbury> I wonder why that is
[15:25:03] <supsup> yah no idea gotta call in the pros maybe error with animate.  also unsure if ur suppose to use stop and clearQueue together like that
[15:25:24] <David_Bradbury> I just stuck them there to make sure that wasn't the problem
[15:26:16] <David_Bradbury> I really appreciate the help
[15:26:48] <supsup> yah sorry don't use animate much but now u can prob ask your question a lot better
[15:26:57] <supsup> room kind of dead now
[15:28:24] <David_Bradbury> Heh
[15:39:43] <supsup> David : it's not a fix but u could put a trampolean graphic sideways on the page :  http://jsfiddle.net/PpkpY/6/
[15:39:54] <supsup> the client would have to like that
[15:42:32] <David_Bradbury> Hah fair enough, that may be an option to increase performance
[15:43:03] <David_Bradbury> Anyways, I appreciate the help, but it is time to get off of work!
[15:43:11] <David_Bradbury> Later :)
[15:51:05] <gregglind> how can I add @font-face declarations to a page after ready (experiement to show user something in their local fonts)
[15:57:46] <gregglind> anyone?  add a @font-face dynamically?  I tried $('style').append() but that is wrong :)
[15:59:21] <gregglind> $('html').append('<style>@font-face...</style>'); seem a bit blunt force
[16:15:02] <Fraz> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2009/365/3/1/UDK_Kismet_for_topdown_view_by_Pharion.jpg what would be the best way to draw lines between 2 points like in this pic?
[16:25:41] <madprops> how can I find an input that has a certain value?
[16:28:53] <IanWizard-Cloud> I hate to ask a jquery-ui question in here, but #jquery-ui is pretty much dead.  I've got a draggable, and a sortable that I'm working with.  .sortable("toArray") returns the id's of it's contents, but when .draggable drops one of it's items into the sortable (using handler: "clone"), it strips it's id tag (rightly so).  I need a way to either get .sortable() to sort by a different attribute (name
[16:28:53] <IanWizard-Cloud>  preferably), or get draggable to put a modified id on the object once it drops it.
[16:29:21] <IanWizard-Cloud> Oh, and to put all that in perspective  *EXTREME DESPERATION*
[16:29:24] <abjorn> :o
[16:30:14] <IanWizard-Cloud> madprops: you could loop through all of the inputs on the page, checking their values.  not efficient on a large page though.
[16:30:50] <gregglind> IanW I wish I had answers, I feel the deadness though :)
[16:31:28] <gregglind> modified from the original?
[16:31:39] <gregglind> re:  put a modified id on the object once it drops it.
[16:31:58] <gregglind> is there an on-drop handler where you could do that?
[16:32:16] <IanWizard-Cloud> gregglind: yes.  take the old objects id, and append something to it, and put it on the dropped object
[16:34:20] <GrendelT> i had no idea this channel existed.
[16:34:25] <GrendelT> i guess i should've known.
[16:36:32] <GrendelT> so, i'm using .dblclick() on a project.
[16:36:44] <GrendelT> when i dblclick an element, i want it to turn to an <input> field
[16:36:48] <GrendelT> that's working
[16:37:14] <GrendelT> on dblclick( ) i call editTitle( ) inside
[16:37:26] <GrendelT> but if i go to edit the field a 2nd time...
[16:37:56] <GrendelT> it receives the new title, but then editTitle() gets called again and sets the title to undefined
[16:38:01] <GrendelT> what gives?
[16:38:04] <GrendelT> bubbling?
[16:39:40] <gregglind> IanWizard-Cloud:  is the 'stop' method not right?
[16:40:11] <GrendelT> no 'stop' in use.
[16:40:16] <GrendelT> or... not defined.
[16:40:39] <GrendelT> oh - that wasnt to me. sry
[16:41:00] <gregglind> sorry GrendelT, strangely quiet here tonight
[16:41:17] <coldhead> terrifying isn't it
[16:41:22] <IanWizard-Cloud> gregglind: :(
[16:41:30] <IanWizard-Cloud> gregglind: yes......
[16:42:25] <IanWizard-Cloud> gregglind: but how would I refer to the old, AND the new elements?   this won't work for both
[16:43:17] <gregglind> maybe during the old's drag start event, you can set something?
[16:43:45] <gregglind> or maybe it's click?
[16:44:18] <gregglind> I don't quite know the sortable + draggable mechanism, but there has to be a click/select before the cloning can happen.
[16:44:54] <IanWizard-Cloud> gregglind: yeah, ill do a global...
[16:45:32] <GrendelT> i'm playing with sort + drag right now
[16:45:34] <GrendelT> what's the issue?
[16:46:29] <IanWizard-Cloud> GrendelT: it strips the id when it clones the element, I need to .....   never mind, I just figured something out.
[16:46:55] <IanWizard-Cloud> GrendelT: I need to have it put a new, modified id on the element that it drops into the sort.
[16:47:08] <crankharder> why is .slice(0,1).length == 1 on a set that has 10 elements in it?
[16:47:29] <GrendelT> ah
[16:48:05] <gregglind> IanW, what is the answer?
[16:48:21] <gregglind> crankharder, do you think it should be 2?
[16:48:23] <GrendelT> IanWizard-Cloud: the clone element does not get the name/id/etc of the original
[16:48:38] <GrendelT> IanWizard-Cloud: you have to set it with .attr('id') =
[16:48:51] <gregglind> crank:  [0,1)  doesn't include the right endpoint
[16:49:25] <fission6> whats a recommended, super light lightbox for allowing user to click image and show full image
[16:49:34] <IanWizard-Cloud> GrendelT: well that kills my solution.  I was going to put it in the name tag, and then switch them all over before I do the sort.
[16:49:50] <GrendelT> IanWizard-Cloud: apologies on the syntax, that's    clone.attr('id', 'FOO_ID_HERE');
[16:50:00] <crankharder> gregglind: ok, ty
[16:50:32] <fission6> any recs?
[16:50:50] <IanWizard-Cloud> GrendelT: ?? is there a clone element, like "this", that I can use to refer to it within the draggable.stop()  function?
[16:51:31] <GrendelT> fission6: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=lightweight+lightbox+click+to+enlarge+js
[16:51:39] <gregglind> crankharder, makes is easy to the head,tail semantics (cf: python) -> a.slice(0,N) + a.slice(N.a.length) = a  # mostly!
[16:53:26] <madprops> is there a reason why only the top div on a column of divs gets removed when i use remove()?
[16:53:44] <GrendelT> it's the first to match
[16:53:51] <GrendelT> want it to happen for each of the divs?
[16:54:09] <GrendelT> check out the .each() function on the website
[16:56:25] <GrendelT> madprops , for effect, use the fadeOut( ) method to make it go away and look good doing it.
[16:57:03] <madprops> GrendelT, im trying to remove a specific div, matching it
[16:59:10] <GrendelT> check out the Selectors section
[16:59:31] <GrendelT> $( '.className' ).remove();      or    $('#idName').remove();
[16:59:36] <gao> GUYS!
[16:59:56] <gao> is there any way i can skip to a certain slide in jquery cycle?!
[17:01:47] <gao> AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[17:02:07] <bot-t> gao, AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[17:21:48] <TrueColors> Whats the best way to loop through a forms elements (which have names) append them to an associative array, or object... name => value, and then json encode it?
[17:22:12] <ajpiano> TrueColors: the best is to get see ?serializeObject
[17:22:12] <bot-t> TrueColors, Whereas jQueryâ€™s built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an (arguably more useful) object. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[17:22:16] <scorphus> TrueColors: set a specific class?
[17:22:26] <ajpiano> and do JSON.stringify($("form").serializeObject());
[17:22:38] <ajpiano> ?stringify
[17:22:38] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[17:23:08] <TrueColors> a whole plugin.. just for json...
[17:23:09] <TrueColors> ouch
[17:23:20] <scorphus> ajpiano: thanks for that stringify =)
[17:23:28] <ajpiano> TrueColors: it's like a TINY plugin
[17:23:30] <ajpiano> but hey
[17:23:52] <TrueColors> 481 lines with 50% of it commented ;P quite a bit. lol
[17:23:58] <ajpiano> if you want to write out var foo =  {}; $("form").find(":input").each(function() { form[this.name] = $(this).val();   });  you have fun with that
[17:24:06] <ajpiano> TrueColors: use the minified version
[17:24:51] <TrueColors> well that .each method is something I was thinking of. that creates an array but it won't quite serialize or json encode it.
[17:25:14] <ajpiano> the nice thing about serializeObject is it observes the rules for form serialization
[17:25:21] <ajpiano> skips disabled, etc etc
[17:25:39] <ajpiano> and since i constantly have to serialize forms to objects
[17:26:02] <ajpiano> and i've known ben for three years and he's rock solid, i go with his tiny plugin that write that out every time
[17:26:15] <TrueColors> That benalman link is not available, atleast it won't load in chrome
[17:26:47] <ajpiano> weird
[17:27:56] <ajpiano> TrueColors https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.min.js
[17:28:09] <ajpiano> i hope that's small enough for you
[17:28:29] <TrueColors> ha, yeah that's a perfect size.
[17:28:43] <TrueColors> can I serialize without.. needing the JSON because then I could unserialize in php and it'll still work the same?
[17:29:24] <ajpiano> i mean yeah, you can just do $.post("foo.php", $("form").serializeObject(), fn);
[17:30:01] <TrueColors> .post? I write out a whole .ajax call -.- damn, haha.
[17:30:17] <ajpiano> whatever
[17:31:17] <TrueColors> so would that be $_POST [ 'data' ] or what?
[17:31:45] <TrueColors> in php
[17:32:25] <TrueColors> nevermind, I'll try it out :)
[17:49:18] <xtrci> hi guys, can anyone help me here?

[18:07:57] <TrueColors> how would that be done
[18:14:23] <polygon-pusher> is  $(v).find('.col.h1.a').text().toLowerCase(); a valid call? I keep getting cant find style where cal is the class of a div that inside of v
[18:14:36] <polygon-pusher> col*
[18:25:05] <airportyh> polygon-pusher: your selector looks wrong, should be '.col h1 a' I believe

[18:52:31] <Superman_> what is the difference between 'return false' and 'e.preventDefault()'

[18:57:46] <ajpiano> Superman_: return false also does event.stopPropagation();
[18:58:09] <Superman_> so we can use any of them?
[18:58:29] <ajpiano> no, you use what is appropriate
[18:58:54] <ajpiano> sometimes you want one, sometimes the other, sometimes both
[19:01:09] <DrPoole> good evening.  I'm a giant failure and cannot get this to work for the life of me.  $('#'+otherId).addClass('mergetablegreen');
[19:01:15] <DrPoole> the id is set on a <tr>
[19:01:28] <pyrotechnick> hi there
[19:01:28] <DrPoole> previously im doing $(this).addClass() and it's working fine.
[19:01:41] <pyrotechnick> anyone using .trigger('create') from jquery mobile b2?
[19:01:47] <pyrotechnick> i cannot for the life of me get it to work
[19:07:05] <GrendelT> pyrotechnick: what does 'create' do?
[19:07:19] <GrendelT> pyrotechnick: is that a function you wrote
[19:08:01] <pyrotechnick> in jqm elements have a method called trigger
[19:08:16] <pyrotechnick> that if you pass 'create' to, is supposed to traverse the element and initialise any widgets it contains
[19:08:26] <pyrotechnick> it's all explained in the blog post about b2
[19:08:32] <pyrotechnick> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/08/03/jquery-mobile-beta-2-released/
[19:08:42] <pyrotechnick> about 1/3 down
[19:09:21] <xrated> Can I get some thoughts on the quality of JQM? We have some mobile projects coming soon and I've been looking at different solutions. jQuery is my favorite JS framework so JQM seems like a good first look.
[19:10:14] <GrendelT> pyrotechnick: sry, haven't played with it.
[19:11:13] <DrPoole> please...somebody....before i blow my fucking brains out.  hours spent trying to color a god damn <tr>
[19:11:38] <DrPoole> can I not do <tr id="foo"> and then $('#foo').addClass() ?
[19:11:49] <xrated> oui
[19:11:54] <xrated> (yes)
[19:11:56] <Ned_> DrPoole: you can do that
[19:12:03] <DrPoole> why....WHY does this not work
[19:12:05] * DrPoole sobs
[19:12:11] <Ned_> DrPoole: err, because of some other issue
[19:12:12] <Ned_> :/
[19:12:15] <xrated> post code.
[19:12:22] <Ned_> DrPoole: you haven't really given anyone enough information to help you ;-)
[19:12:28] <coldhead> maybe you need to do tr.someClass * {background-color:#bada55}
[19:12:29] <xrated> ^
[19:12:41] <coldhead> tables are fiddly
[19:12:49] <xrated> It's ironic that #bada55 is the least badass color ever
[19:13:04] <GrendelT> DrPoole: what class are you adding?
[19:13:31] <GrendelT> your syntax is fine, you just need to put a class in the paren's to add
[19:13:59] <DrPoole> im adding 'mergetablewhite' which is .mergetablewhite { background-color: #ffffff; }
[19:14:39] <DrPoole> the id is being figured out.  i alert the id.  it does exist.  there's only 1.
[19:14:56] <DrPoole> right above it im doing $(this).addClass('mergetablegray'); and that's fine and dandy
[19:14:56] <coldhead> good class name
[19:14:58] <GrendelT> there should typically only ever be 1 id of any name
[19:15:15] <coldhead> s/typically//;
[19:15:16] <GrendelT> (good form)
[19:15:25] <GrendelT> *agreed
[19:15:40] <GrendelT> :%s/typically//g   ;)
[19:21:52] <madprops> shouldnt this make a smooth removal?         pm.fadeOut(3000,function() {
[19:21:52] <madprops>              $(this).parent().remove();
[19:21:52] <madprops>          });
[19:22:12] <madprops> fadeout is not working at all
[19:22:55] <GrendelT> what is the parent?
[19:23:05] <GrendelT> can you alert the parent id?
[19:23:39] <madprops> GrendelT, nvm i used hide('slow')
[19:23:48] <GrendelT> k
[19:24:12] <GrendelT> fadeOut should work... dunno why it wouldn't work for you
[19:32:52] <daum2> this is werid anyone ahve an issue where document.write doesn't work in IE unless it is running in compat mode? on ie 9(i know this isn't directly jQuery but this seems to be the most popular js room)
[19:34:10] <coldhead> this room also kinda detests document.write() :\
[19:34:18] <Alqounkiz> guys, is there something wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/ycvRCLBS
[19:34:29] <GrendelT> probably so.
[19:34:29] <Alqounkiz> this is a div by the id of "nav"
[19:34:53] <daum2> coldhead: hm i know this is some old site a person asked me to look at
[19:35:48] <GrendelT> coldhead: anything added to the page with document.write will not be processed until the load event has finished
[19:36:04] <GrendelT> so if you have handlers or anything in $()   - you may not see the output of doc.write
[19:36:07] <daum2> it is just outputting some html
[19:36:29] <coldhead> also reflows, GrendelT
[19:36:32] <coldhead> it's :(
[19:37:00] <Alqounkiz> anybody see anything wrong with my paste?
[19:37:06] <GrendelT> coldhead: can you not add it to the page through a different method?
[19:37:23] <coldhead> GrendelT: it's not me who is using it
[19:37:26] <coldhead> pay more attention
[19:37:49] * GrendelT doh!
[19:37:58] <coldhead> when i want to use document.write i know the best way to do it is with a packet sniffer
[19:38:06] <GrendelT> XD
[19:38:06] <coldhead> and a hex editor
[19:38:21] <coldhead> and that is why no one will hire me
[19:38:48] <GrendelT> where u live?
[19:39:44] <Alqounkiz> guys my console is giving me this error
[19:39:44] <Alqounkiz> with(_FirebugCommandLine){checkForNavScroll();
[19:39:44] <Alqounkiz> };
[19:40:03] <GrendelT> did you check for it?
[19:40:26] <coldhead> GrendelT: .au
[19:40:36] <GrendelT> PM
[19:41:51] <madprops> any idea why i can remove the top div but then i cant remove anything? http://dpaste.com/597847/
[19:49:41] <sven_oostenbrink> In ls -l, what does the * behind a filename mean?
[19:49:47] <madprops> can i use jquery in server side code and use it when i send it to the client?
[19:50:05] <GrendelT> sven_oostenbrink - check over in #linux
[19:50:09] <GrendelT> *wildcard
[19:52:47] <coldhead> madprops: unrelatedly, you want to var pm instead of just pm on line 2
[19:52:58] <coldhead> and then you don't seem to be trying to remove anymore
[19:53:49] <madprops> coldhead, i call that with a delete button on each div
[19:54:02] <sven_oostenbrink> my bad, wrong channel
[19:54:27] <coldhead> try the "var", maybe it's related
[19:56:37] <budu> hi
[19:56:49] <GrendelT> hi
[19:56:55] <ngharo> hi
[19:56:56] <madprops> coldhead, var didn't solve it :/
[19:57:17] <budu> i'm having a strange error: reference to undefined jQuery.valHooks[this] at line 3005
[19:57:46] <budu> it happens only under Firefox and Windows
[19:58:17] <budu> it doesn't show up under Linux or MacOS using either Chrome or FF
[19:58:24] <coldhead> oh madprops, you can't have more than one element with the id "#pm_post
[19:58:30] <coldhead> try making it a class
[19:58:55] <budu> has someone seen this?
[19:59:16] <imsky> i've seen things you people wouldn't believe
[19:59:19] <imsky> and from this side only
[19:59:50] <coldhead> budu: can we see the code that is triggering the error?
[20:01:04] <budu> that's the worst part, I can't seems to get to it using Firebug
[20:01:16] <budu> the higher I get is "$(rails.linkClickSelector).live('click.rails', function(e) {..."
[20:01:49] <budu> which is part of rails-ujs i thinkl
[20:03:05] <madprops> coldhead, you were totally right kudos!
[20:03:15] <budu> ok, Firebug unfroze and I got to:
[20:03:54] <budu> var league = new FS.Draft.League(
[20:03:54] <budu> _.extend(JSON.parse('{...long JSON string...}')));
[20:05:19] <budu> in fact the second line is _.extend(JSON.parse('{...long JSON string...}', JSON.parse('{...another long JSON string...}'))
[20:05:53] <budu> seems totally unrelated though!
[20:07:00] <coldhead> that sounds hard, budu
[20:07:04] <coldhead> do you have a live demo?
[20:07:51] <budu> no, it would be pretty hard to extract also, it's a big project using Backbone
[20:08:42] <budu> it takes Firegub something like 10 min to get to my code!
[20:08:50] <budu> Firebug*
[20:09:14] <budu> jumping all over jQuery, and sometime freezing
[20:09:24] <budu> i'll try Chrome
[20:12:15] <zoggy> sounds like some shitty code
[20:12:29] <zoggy> and/or machine specs
[20:13:39] <budu> Chrome brings up a much clearer error message, doesn't have anything to do with jQuery though
[20:16:10] <budu> ok I've fixed the issue with Chrome, was totally unrelated and it works
[20:16:20] <madprops> i need a clickable image to expand into a menu, kinda like facebook does, what am i looking for?
[20:16:38] <budu> So it really just happen under FF in Windows, really weird!
[20:18:01] <budu> also I've tried under FF5 & FF6, same thing
[20:21:26] <budu> it get even more strange, if I disable "break on all errors" the app work flawlessly!
[20:21:58] <budu> yet under linux FF doesn't break as there's no errors
[20:22:30] <coldhead> hell
[20:22:36] <budu> i begin to wonder if the problem is with a windows version of Firebug
[20:24:19] <saganbyte> budu, i joined th conversation late, is the problem in execution of some page, where the page doesnt render at all
[20:25:38] <budu> nope, the page render well, it only when i open firebug with 'break on all errors' under Windows that it yell about some weird error
[20:25:55] <budu> "reference to undefined jQuery.valHooks[this] at line 3005"
[20:26:28] <budu> stepping out using the debugger nearly kill my computer!
[20:27:49] <budu> and i don't get this anywhere else, any combination of linux, macos, chrome, safari, ff doesn't show that error
[20:28:14] <ussher_> anyone know a plugin that will allow muliple images to be poped up and dragable.  Closest i have found is this (mopbox) which popups up an image and allows dragable, but doesnt seam to want to allow _multiple_ images at the same time. http://www.mopstudio.jp/mopBox2demo.html#?mopBox
[20:30:54] <budu> anyway, i'll try to isolate the issue, but that might take some time so good night everybody
[20:31:15] <coldhead> good luck, budu!
[20:31:58] <coldhead> lol emacs
[20:54:11] <madprops> i really dont like when people comment their code
[20:54:23] <madprops> the first think i do is remove them
[20:54:31] <coldhead> you foolish fool!
[20:54:36] <coldhead> my comments are my best work
[20:54:54] <ussher_> i dont like it when people _dont_ leave comments.
[20:55:00] <madprops> i guess it's just me
[20:55:18] <ussher_> im sure youd hate my code.  tons of comments
[20:55:27] <coldhead> here's the one i just wrote
[20:55:29] <coldhead> if (root.length < 1) root = $('body'); // Desperate measures.
[20:56:20] <ussher_> i like to put illustrations around important comments /***************somethingimportant************************/ on multiple lines
[20:56:55] <coldhead> right on, ussher_
[20:57:35] <ussher_> find that when you come back later on its easier to read the comments to get the flow of what i was thinking
[20:57:54] <saganbyte> I love writing comments so much that I dont even write the code
[20:57:55] <saganbyte> :P
[20:58:07] <coldhead> saganbyte: you're hired
[20:58:12] <saganbyte> :D
[20:58:16] <saganbyte> o/
[20:58:17] <coldhead> comments are also good for bitching about mgmt
[20:58:23] <saganbyte> O7
[20:58:24] <coldhead> and coworkers
[20:58:40] <coldhead> // To whomever necessitated this workaround: I KILL YOU!!!
[20:58:55] <saganbyte> :D
[20:58:56] <ussher_> lol
[20:59:05] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[20:59:11] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I wanna add a div for error to an input
[20:59:13] <Nicolas_Leonida2> $(erroneousObject).append('<div class="inputErrorMessage"><p>'+erroMessage+'</p><div>');
[20:59:47] <Nicolas_Leonida2> this is what I'm doing, but nothing is being added, erroneousObject = $("#" + erroneousObjectId);
[20:59:51] <chubicle> hey, so my coworker working on the backend of a project used springroo to create the web app, now he wants me to modify it by replacing the ui with jquery ui, how can i go about doing this?
[21:00:31] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, when are you actually appending?
[21:00:35] <coldhead> chubicle: first, download jQuery UI and add it to the HTML
[21:00:47] <coldhead> then reimplement each feature using UI
[21:00:54] <Nicolas_Leonida2> saganbyte: when ajax data returns bringing back the errors array
[21:01:17] <saganbyte> Have you placed the error in the callback
[21:01:40] <ussher_> Nicolas_Leonida2: just as an aside, is erroneousObjectId a number?  if so maybe add a prefix to the hash so its not a numeric id
[21:02:04] <Nicolas_Leonida2> saganbyte: yeah, but forget about that part, the correct object is found, I wanna add a div under it
[21:02:21] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I know it's the correct object because I change it's class too
[21:02:24] <chubicle> coldhead: thats what i'm trying to do. but i'm having a lot of difficulty with these .jspx files, and i generally just have a small knowledge about spring roo. but thanks for the advice, i'll keep trying.
[21:02:31] <Nicolas_Leonida2> It seems like you can't append a <div> after an input
[21:02:44] <Handyman> hey, does anyone here have experience with the jquery ui autocomplete?
[21:04:46] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ussher_: ID is not a number no
[21:07:10] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, can you paste th code in question in pastebin
[21:07:44] <Nicolas_Leonida2> http://pastebin.com/WK10rEA6
[21:07:46] <Nicolas_Leonida2> there you go
[21:07:53] <Nicolas_Leonida2> both inputs are strings
[21:11:01] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, 1. are you able to append the error msg without adding the class
[21:11:16] <Nicolas_Leonida2> nevermind people, my apologies, the error is somewhere else
[21:11:25] <saganbyte> 2. why not use addClass instead of objectClasses = $(erroneousObject).attr('class') + " errorInputBox";,
[21:11:33] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, that was obvious
[21:12:38] <pyrotechnick> anyone here a jquery mobile wizard?
[21:13:32] <Nicolas_Leonida2> saganbyte: I didn't know that class exists lol
[21:13:55] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, :)
[21:14:56] <Nicolas_Leonida2> thanks
[21:31:17] <bricker> hey guys, I am not too good with javascript/jqueryâ€¦ how can I get this method to return the object schedule_event? http://pastie.org/2395013
[21:36:00] <E289> hi. i have <input> elements with classname 'updown'. i want to make it go to the next/prev <input> when up/down is pressed. how do i do that?
[21:38:08] <saganbyte> bricker, maybe var schedule_event should be defined before $.create()
[21:39:12] <saganbyte> E289, when you say it should go to the next/prev <input> do you mean, highlight that input by setting focus on it or adding some class to it?
[21:39:24] <E289> saganbyte yes :)
[21:40:06] <saganbyte> E289, will it start at the first of all the updown elements?
[21:40:42] <E289> hmm. i'm thinking that a user might click an updown element at the middle, but he should be able to navigate by pressing up/down
[21:41:07] <saganbyte> E289, that is fine, but will it all begin at the first one?
[21:41:23] <saganbyte> E289, i mean will the first one be highlighted by default
[21:41:39] <E289> ah, by default no. but i can adjust it to be like that if thats simpler
[21:42:03] <saganbyte> E289, it just gets us a point to start at, though we can do away with it later
[21:42:10] <saganbyte> E289, there is one way this can be done
[21:42:18] <saganbyte> I m sure there are better ways to do this
[21:42:29] <saganbyte> first we need to declare a var updownId = 0
[21:42:39] <E289> ok. im learnign jquery. i'd be able to do this with plain JS but i want to learn jquery for a simpler life hehe
[21:42:42] <E289> ok
[21:42:46] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hey I want to fadeIn the div in this, what should I do? $("#" + erroneousObject).after('<div class="ui-state-default ui-helper-clearfix inputErrorMessage"><p>'+erroMessage+'</p><div>');
[21:43:11] <saganbyte> then another called updownElement = $(".updown").get(updownId)
[21:43:23] <saganbyte> this will make the first one as selected (by default)
[21:43:24] <saganbyte> then
[21:43:41] <saganbyte> on click some next prev or hitting up or down keys
[21:44:05] <saganbyte> pass a function to check if updownId < $(".updown").size()-1
[21:44:08] <saganbyte> if so
[21:44:29] <saganbyte> increment (or decrement if down was pressed) updownId
[21:44:42] <saganbyte>  updownElement = $(".updown").get(updownId)
[21:45:12] <saganbyte> $(updownElement).addClass("highlightClass")
[21:45:13] <E289> ok i get it. but wait, .get is also .focus()?
[21:45:14] <saganbyte> oh
[21:45:32] <saganbyte> no i think .get will return the index of the element
[21:45:54] <saganbyte> one thing i forgot, before hightlighting the next class make sure to unhighlight existing class
[21:46:05] <E289> ah then i can use $('.updown')[updownId].focus() ?
[21:46:12] <saganbyte> $(".hightlightClass").removeClass("highlightClass")
[21:46:18] <saganbyte> yes
[21:46:56] <E289> ok, thank you!
[21:47:05] <saganbyte> You could even write a simple JS object with jquery in it to manage this kind of a func if you find yourself doing it often
[21:47:09] <saganbyte> :)
[21:47:11] <saganbyte> np
[21:51:31] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, can you not directly add $(".inputErrorMessage").show(300); immeditately after $.after()?
[21:53:04] <saganbyte> Nicolas_Leonida2, of course you d need to hide it first or set one of th classes to have display:none
[22:06:06] <abstrusenick> I'm doing a bookmarklet that opens up a new window, but on safari i always get extra height, how can i resize a window?
[22:18:09] <krz> how do i verify that ALL the li's in a ul have a class 'foobar'?
[22:18:30] <pyrotechnick> okay
[22:18:40] <pyrotechnick> are you using any collection libs like underscore?
[22:18:49] <krz> no
[22:19:02] <pyrotechnick> what platforms are you targetting
[22:19:33] <krz> dont waste my time
[22:19:59] <pyrotechnick> i asked you a question
[22:20:07] <pyrotechnick> dont waste mine by saying dont waste mine
[22:20:08] <pyrotechnick> answer it
[22:20:11] <pyrotechnick> so i can tailor an answer for you
[22:20:12] <pyrotechnick> jesus
[22:21:01] <krz> what does it matter which platform i am targeting ?
[22:21:17] <pyrotechnick> because i want to know what ecma features you have available
[22:21:41] <krz> and what on earth does collection libs have to do with my question?
[22:21:46] <pyrotechnick> jesus christ man
[22:21:49] <pyrotechnick> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/ECMA-5-Mozilla-Features-Implemented-in-V8
[22:21:56] <pyrotechnick> see the ecma 5 array extensions on this page
[22:21:59] <pyrotechnick> one of them is every
[22:22:12] <pyrotechnick> now if you'd just have answered instead of turning it into something else you'd have some code by now
[22:22:16] <pyrotechnick> but there you go
[22:22:19] <pyrotechnick> if you can use that then use that
[22:23:17] <pyrotechnick> $('ul li').every (li) -> li.hasClass 'foobar'
[22:23:20] <pyrotechnick> that's coffee
[22:23:38] <pyrotechnick> $('ul li').every(function(li) { return li.hasClass('foobar'); });
[22:23:39] <pyrotechnick> that's js
[22:23:49] <pyrotechnick> now next time someone asks you for more information just give it to them so they can help you
[22:23:51] <krz> ok got it. thanks for the tip
[22:24:00] <pyrotechnick> no problem mate
[22:24:06] <pyrotechnick> let me know if that works
[22:24:10] <pyrotechnick> in your environments
[22:24:14] <krz> will do
[22:25:07] <pyrotechnick> if you know how many you have you could try ul.find('li.foobar').length
[22:25:36] <pyrotechnick> like i said, how elegant it can be depends on your target
[22:26:13] <pyrotechnick> as for why i ask if you're using underscore, because underscore provides _.every on unsupported platforms ;)
[22:29:04] <sasori> hi, without showing off any code here, do you have any thoughts in mind why a hover effect doesn't work on IE but works on FF ?
[22:30:24] <danheberden> super secret code will do that
[22:30:41] <pyrotechnick> yeah i would probably try open source code
[22:30:52] <pyrotechnick> there's some on github.com
[22:31:18] <danheberden> sasori how 'bouts making an example of the problem on jsfiddle.net
[22:31:27] <danheberden> that way we can see if you're doing something wrong
[22:32:03] <sasori> danheberden: ok, hang on 1 sec..i got confused w/ this project, it has 7k+ js lines :(
[22:32:35] <danheberden> just a wild guess, but i'm guessing one of the other 6999 lines is causing your problem
[22:34:02] <coldhead> just 1?
[22:34:27] <danheberden> it only takes 1
[22:35:14] <jtannenbaum> http://gripptravel.com/gallery.html the lightbox used here (click on any flower) works on my machine but not when it's on the server
[22:35:41] <danheberden> works for me
[22:36:01] <danheberden> jtannenbaum http://danheberden.com/share/b29436.png
[22:36:18] <jtannenbaum> weird.. thanks
[22:36:25] <jtannenbaum> I'm in Chrome
[22:36:31] <jtannenbaum> on Ubuntu
[22:37:31] <danheberden> more like Ubuttu
[22:38:03] <sevenpluseight> hi! good morning, I have a little jQuery script that takes my active LI and when I click on a new one, makes that active, the only problem is, when the new page loads, the li that was set to active is set back to active again... how can I make the new LI take ont he active class on the new document as well? This is what I have.. http://pastebin.com/4ke9a94g
[22:41:39] <sasori> danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/GHUhF/ am not sure if you'll understand that,, :( i just copied the portion that has the supposedly functionality that hovers a menu
[22:43:13] <danheberden> sasori i don't know javascript, but i'll try
[22:43:40] <sevenpluseight> anyone? :)
[22:44:07] <danheberden> sasori i'm going to recommend you get a new overlay plugin
[22:44:11] <danheberden> they're out there
[22:44:29] <danheberden> this code is removing the style attribute, checking for IE versions - it's fucking gross
[22:44:37] <sasori> danheberden: you mean to say, it's just a ready made plugin ?
[22:44:48] <danheberden> like - there's overlay plugins that are better'
[22:44:59] <danheberden> is it just a fullscreen dialog kind of thing?
[22:45:42] <sasori> it's like, there's a menu at the header, when one hovers on each, there's a window like thing that fades in/out
[22:46:03] <danheberden> sevenpluseight if you need content to persist between page loads, you either a) store it on the server and retrieve it or b) save it in a cookie. if you don't need to worry about legacy browsers, c) keep it in local storage
[22:46:41] <danheberden> sasori is it just a dropdown menu?
[22:47:09] <sasori> danheberden: no, it's not a drop down..lemme give you a screen shot
[22:47:28] <sevenpluseight> I just need to change li class=active on my home link to li class=active on my about us link when I click it.. do I have to do server storage and cookies for that?
[22:47:57] <danheberden> sevenpluseight does the url reflect that? that you're on the about page?
[22:48:19] <sevenpluseight> yeah
[22:48:36] <danheberden> so maybe on document ready, you go through your nav elements and see if their href is in the url?
[22:48:38] <sasori> danheberden: here's how it looks like http://s3.postimage.org/cui7bzqeu/juqery1.jpg
[22:49:10] <rpaddock> What's an intelligent way of debugging jQuery in IE? Code works on every other browser no problem, but not on IE 7/8
[22:49:51] <sevenpluseight> danheberden, that sounds very simple, how could I accomplish that? (sorry i'm a noob) I dont' want you to write it for me, just possibly show me where I can learn it or give me a hint, if you can. I wouldu really appreicate it
[22:49:51] <danheberden> even something as crude as window.location.href.indexOf( $(whatever).attr('href') ) >= -1 would work
[22:50:10] <danheberden> get all the nav li's, loop through them with each
[22:50:17] <danheberden> check if their href is in window.location.href
[22:50:22] <danheberden> if so, add 'active' to their class
[22:50:26] <danheberden> or whatevs you're doing
[22:50:37] <danheberden> ?firebug @ rpaddock
[22:50:54] <danheberden> bot-t?!
[22:50:59] <danheberden> I NEED YOU BOT-T
[22:51:06] <danheberden> rpaddock check out firebug lite
[22:51:19] <danheberden> it's the tiger's rawr
[22:52:00] <danheberden> no offense sasori - that's a horrible overlay :p
[22:52:41] <danheberden> what i would do, sasori, is make those overlays via css. Position absolute, make them look good, and then display:none; them
[22:52:55] <danheberden> that way, when the nav elements get hover, you just show/fadeIn the appropriate one
[22:53:06] <danheberden> so like, get them all looking good via css before you touch the JS
[22:53:32] <danheberden> that'll a) be more maintainable b) be quicker c) get you a hot date
[22:53:38] <danheberden> c isn't gauranteed
[22:55:02] <sasori> thanks danheberden , it helped eased the pain a bit XD
[22:55:20] <danheberden> that's what we're here for
[22:55:25] <danheberden> ... and cuddling
[22:55:35] * danheberden looks at coldhead
[22:55:59] <devinrolsen> evening.
[22:57:35] <danheberden> hoowwwdy
[23:07:32] <owen`t> GOOD DAY!
[23:07:39] <owen`t> evening*
[23:21:22] <sevenpluseight> danheberden, been searching online since we spoke, trying to figrue out how I would loop through the links to find the one I want active, but I'm still a little lost, would you mind giving me a little more information?
[23:21:31] <sevenpluseight> sorry to bother -_-
[23:22:15] <chjj> $(
[23:22:26] <chjj> $('a').each(function() {etc});
[23:22:53] <chjj> sorry, im not putting in more effort
[23:23:17] <sevenpluseight> well if that's what I need I could work with that :D okay so $('a').each(function() {etc}); would go with this stuff?
[23:23:24] <sevenpluseight> $(this).parent().addClass('active');
[23:23:33] <chjj> what are you trying to do exactly?
[23:23:39] <chjj> what links are you looking for?
[23:23:55] <sevenpluseight> I have a ul li class avtive for my home link
[23:24:02] <sevenpluseight> I'm using CI so I have a header that's constant
[23:24:07] <sevenpluseight> when I click about
[23:24:14] <sevenpluseight> I want the active class to swtich to it
[23:24:24] <sevenpluseight> even when the page loads to the new about page
[23:25:28] <chjj> this is actually something that could be accomplished with css and some serverside code, unless you want it to be really dynamic
[23:27:08] <sevenpluseight> mmm I don't care really, as long as it works
[23:27:13] <sevenpluseight> simple is good for me
[23:27:46] <chjj> well its as simple as making a rule for that particular class
[23:27:58] <chjj> .active { color: #f00; }
[23:28:01] <chjj> for example
[23:28:03] <danheberden> sevenpluseight http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/f32c7/
[23:28:23] <danheberden> or, ya - just add the class from your server side if you can
[23:28:23] <chjj> and then inserting that class depending
[23:28:28] <danheberden> whatevs bro
[23:29:23] <chjj> if its not like an "app app", i usually try to do most little flourishes without any js
[23:34:45] <sevenpluseight> just testign it out now den :D
[23:41:24] <sevenpluseight> hey dan, I added it in, seems to be no errors, just not changing the active
[23:41:42] <sevenpluseight> I'm just uploading it now, maybe see if I'm doing something wrong :/
[23:42:34] <danheberden> it wasn't supposed to be completely copy/pasteable - you'll have to use the concept to make it work
[23:42:45] <sevenpluseight> yeah I tweaked it for my config
[23:42:52] <sevenpluseight> but I feel like I'm just missing something
[23:46:29] <ussher_> danheberden: " super secret code will do that"  Love this... made my day :)
[23:49:32] <danheberden> sevenpluseight be sure you're paying attention to your console
[23:49:44] <danheberden> check for errors and tinker accordinly
[23:50:16] <sevenpluseight> yeah, I have it open and no errors
[23:50:20] <sevenpluseight> so that's why I'm so confused
[23:50:26] <sevenpluseight> it's like it's not even having an effect
[23:51:15] <danheberden> change one thing for me
[23:51:25] <danheberden> do var $as = $( '#mainnav a');
[23:51:31] <danheberden> then the $as.each( function() {
[23:53:26] <sevenpluseight> okay made the change, still nothing goingon
[23:53:37] <fireh> sevenpluseight, "on new page load" == markup from server, unless i'm missing something
[23:56:27] <sevenpluseight> fireh, what do you mean, sorry this is all very new to me
[23:58:03] <fireh> your html is fresh from server, but the .active class is set to Home when it should've been set to About
[23:58:29] <sevenpluseight> yeah! so how can I do that
[23:58:41] <fireh> what cms you're using?
[23:58:53] <sevenpluseight> no CMS, just using CodeIgnitor
[23:59:00] <sevenpluseight> HTML5 boilerplate
