[01:03:06] <kokut> yea its .next() ty
[01:07:28] <dayasingh> superscrollorama, to fade in we do this controller.addTween('#member-container-2-head', TweenMax.from( jQuery('#member-container-2-head'), .5, {css:{opacity: 0}})); how to fade it out, i tried opacity: 1, but nothing happens
[01:09:03] <walabe> can someone help me, I posted on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30861065/need-help-setting-up-a-jquery-plugin-spritespin  go to the comments of the top answer. I don't understand what he means
[01:09:39] <dayasingh> lol
[01:11:50] <walabe> ?
[01:13:15] <Uhkis> walabe: currently you're adding slick.js twice, which might cause your problems
[01:14:14] <walabe> Do you mean /slick.min.js and slick.js
[01:14:26] <Uhkis> yes
[01:15:12] <walabe> ahh still not working
[01:17:07] <CluelessDev> Eyo folks anyone here that knows a lot about debugging jqXHR errors ?
[01:17:41] <stangeland> hi, anybody knows how to get google place_id based on a cityname and a countryname?
[01:18:20] <CluelessDev> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder
[01:19:03] <dziegler> walabe: still both included on your page
[01:21:43] <dziegler> walabe: and i guess this is the solution for your problem: https://github.com/giniedp/spritespin/issues/9
[01:29:47] <CluelessDev> Can anyone figure out where the json request goes wrong ? http://www.kelderbouwdeneweth.be/cms/
[01:33:01] <dziegler> CluelessDev: your page dont return json it retuns html?!
[01:33:25] <CluelessDev> Yeah that's the issue but I have no clue why
[01:33:40] <CluelessDev> If you check the data-host where it fetches it
[01:33:45] <CluelessDev> It's the right json
[01:33:52] <dziegler> this is a server side issue, fix your application
[01:35:58] <dziegler> or your query the wrong url iwth your ajax request
[01:36:30] <CluelessDev> Hmm going to log the entire progress to see where the distortion happens
[01:36:46] <CluelessDev> Bingo
[01:36:51] <CluelessDev> Host isn't resolving
[01:36:54] <CluelessDev> Weird
[01:39:19] <CluelessDev> Aaaah! There were multiple elements with the selector class for the data host

[01:45:52] <dimi1947> I am using jquery validate....can the plugin work OK when you copy/pasting values to the input boxes....I want just to rule out any possibility that there might be problems there
[01:53:00] <CluelessDev> Depends. If you run the validate on post, for sure. If you run validate on focus removal probably. If you run on value change, yes ect

[02:05:13] <al-damiri> Hi #jQuery. Anyone familiary with leanModal.js, please help on how can I enable the modal dialog to have scrolling?
[02:05:37] <al-damiri> leanModal.js -> http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/
[02:07:16] <Bjerre> I have a quick question to anyone who has some knowledge with jquery or pure javascript. I need my javascript in this http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/4vzvwggo/ to be more compressed. I know there is a way to make this happen with only one function so if anyone could help me out that would be great. Don't mind the css or html code, what I need is to cut down on the lines in the javascript
[02:07:37] <HD|Laptop> hello all
[02:08:34] <HD|Laptop> Assuming I have two ul's #nav_top and #nav_bottom, and I select their lis via $("#nav_bottom li,#nav_top li"), still the li's from nav_top turn up first
[02:09:08] <HD|Laptop> How do I make the order of the li's in the list follow the order of the selectors, not whatever order jquery uses?
[02:09:34] <HD|Laptop> can I maybe make two arrays, one per selector, and then combine the two arrays and then iterate over the li's?
[02:13:29] <Cork> HD|Laptop: the order in jquery is the order the elements exist in the dom
[02:13:48] <Cork> HD|Laptop: you would have to make separate selections if you want to have them in an out of dom order
[02:14:03] <HD|Laptop> Cork: yeah but then I'd have to duplicate the .each() function
[02:16:03] <Cork> HD|Laptop: you could use .sort on the array
[02:16:22] <HD|Laptop> that would totally mess with the order of the individual li's
[02:16:24] <Cork> but ya, the selector order doesn't affect anything
[02:16:54] <Bjerre> hey Cork
[02:17:00] <HD|Laptop> I just need the nav_bottom li's before the nav_top li's, but in the order they appear in their respective ul's
[02:17:26] <Bjerre> you got time? Trying to cut down some lines in my javascript. Is it possible to do this js without two functions? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/4vzvwggo/
[02:17:47] <Cork> HD|Laptop: so select the uls and inside that each select $(this).find('li')
[02:18:28] <Cork> Bjerre: sure
[02:18:47] <HD|Laptop> so you mean, wrap another selector/each loop around the existing one?
[02:19:23] <Cork> HD|Laptop: $('ul').each(function() { $(this).find('li').each(function() {}) });
[02:19:55] <HD|Laptop> wouldn't it be possible to e.g. do var $top=$("#nav_top li"); var $bottom=$("#nav_bottom li"); var $array=(insert magic here); $array.each(...)?
[02:21:45] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/4vzvwggo/1/
[02:22:11] <dayasingh> how can i do two animations with scrollorama at the same time>
[02:22:12] <Cork> HD|Laptop: that would be the .sort method
[02:23:23] <HD|Laptop> Cork: maybe I'm getting that wrong but wouldn't a sort on $("nav_bottom li, nav_top li") mix *all* the li's?
[02:23:33] <HD|Laptop> besides, on which criteria should I sort?
[02:23:40] <Cork> ?mdn array.sort
[02:23:40] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.sort() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[02:23:51] <Cork> it depends on what your function logic tells it to do
[02:26:16] <Bjerre> Cork: you're a life saver
[02:26:21] <Bjerre> thank you so much
[02:26:26] <Cork> np
[02:26:59] <Uhkis> someone had a gun to your head saying OPTIMIZE? :D
[02:28:07] <dayasingh> Cork
[02:30:50] <HD|Laptop> Cork: your trick doesn't work either, it suffers from the same problem that #nav_top is before #nav_bottom in the DOM
[02:31:19] <HD|Laptop> and so in the $("#nav_bottom,#nav_top").each nav_top appears first again
[02:31:58] <Cork> uh... what is it you're trying to do?
[02:32:14] <Cork> you want to move the ul elements?
[02:34:07] <PCatinean> Any general directives on how to make a jquery tooltip so it's cross-browser compatible and reasonably good looking?
[02:34:33] <HD|Laptop> nope, I need to clone the menus for mobile... but I managed to get it done using reverse()
[02:35:35] <dayasingh> Cork: how can i make these two buttons appear together and not in sequence ??
[02:35:37] <dayasingh> http://jsfiddle.net/ogo30cvp/
[02:35:44] <Cork> inline-block
[02:36:09] <Cork> or...
[02:36:12] <Cork> what buttons?
[02:36:16] <Samii> Does anybody know of a plugin I can use as a widget to pick a date which doesn't involve the year? It's for recording regular seasonal holiday times - so 15th June - 20th September every year
[02:36:20] <dayasingh> scroll down you will see
[02:36:23] <dayasingh> its scrollorama
[02:36:30] <Cork> ah, the timeline thingy
[02:36:30] <Samii> Or does anybody know what it might be called to assist in googling!
[02:36:38] <Cork> like i said, i don't know how that lib works
[02:36:45] <dayasingh> forget timeline
[02:36:51] <dayasingh> they both function same
[02:37:05] <Cork> uh... as timeline is the one adding them one after each other...
[02:37:15] <Cork> it's kinda hard to ignore it
[02:37:42] <dayasingh> even without timeline it would be ok
[02:38:27] <dayasingh> if i remove timeline, it all happpens at once
[02:38:31] <dayasingh> thats the problem
[02:38:42] <dayasingh> there are other animations too
[02:45:53] <workerbeetwo> Hi. how replace the id of an element?
[02:46:39] <workerbeetwo> or copy the element with a new id and removing the old one.
[02:53:50] <micalm> workerbeetwo: .attr() ?
[03:05:43] <workerbeetwo> micalm: ah. sure. so simple.
[03:17:29] <PrasanthG> Hi there
[03:17:45] <PrasanthG> can anyone check this output? https://jsfiddle.net/11t31sm7/2/
[03:17:52] <PrasanthG> code is fine. but no output
[03:25:27] <prohobo> hi, is there a way to like.. disable a jquery ui menu?
[03:25:30] <prohobo> just make it stop
[03:25:34] <prohobo> please?
[03:37:20] <PrasanthG> can anyone check this output? https://jsfiddle.net/11t31sm7/2/ code is fine, but no output
[03:43:37] <Cork> PrasanthG: shuffle is false so .init doesn't do anything more then set some values
[03:43:53] <Cork> i suspect the plugin expects visible to be added to the first element statically
[03:47:35] <PrasanthG> ok cork
[03:50:03] <PrasanthG> Cork: can you please change it for me?
[03:50:20] <Cork> uh add the class to the first li in the html
[03:52:49] <hellyeah> hey
[03:54:02] <hellyeah> i am using jquery dialog box and bootstrap i used hidden-xl class to hide some column but when i click the row i want to see all row what can i do to achieve that?
[04:00:00] <PrasanthG> Thank you cork. Well, here is the issue.
[04:00:09] <PrasanthG> Cork:  Can you please look into it.
[04:00:11] <PrasanthG> https://jsfiddle.net/11t31sm7/3/
[04:00:47] <PrasanthG> On first load, the images aren't displaying but when i click next button it starts working and shows the images
[04:01:01] <PrasanthG> what is the issue for not showing items on load
[04:03:01] <PrasanthG> Cork: Thanks a lot. I figured it out. Thank you very much.
[04:03:51] <walabe> hello
[04:30:29] <PrasanthG> hello
[04:33:14] <walabe> how would I make a jquery plugin responsive. It seems to be defined by "width: number" and "height: number" in the jquery code. Is there a way to make this change and resize on browser width?
[04:33:43] <Patabugen> walabe: is this someone elses Plugin or your own?
[04:33:49] <walabe> Someone elses
[04:33:58] <Patabugen> What's it doing which isn't responsive?
[04:34:05] <Patabugen> (it'd be really handy to make a jsfiddle )
[04:34:30] <walabe> When I resize the browser it's not shrinking and staying the same size, so consequently it's being pushed out of the position it's suppose to be in (centre)
[04:34:41] <walabe> okay one second, I'll upload it
[04:38:28] <walabe> patabugen okay here we go: http://chronox.netai.net/
[04:38:35] <walabe> right down the bottom, the spinny watch
[04:44:33] <Patabugen> walabe: It's still not loaded the page...
[04:44:47] <walabe> oh lol
[04:45:39] <walabe> Yeah it's pretty fat and I haven't focused on making it load fast yet. But shouldn't  be taking that long
[04:50:33] <Patabugen> walabe: Make a jsfiddle of the issue, it'll be much easier to figure out
[06:09:26] <walabe> Can someone tell me how to make the bottom watch rotator plugin responsive?? e.g. resize on browser resize?
[06:09:26] <walabe> http://chronox.netai.net/
[06:09:26] <walabe> it's this plugin: http://spritespin.ginie.eu/howto.html
[06:16:57] <DarsVaeda> how do I combine this the correct way? .find("tbody td[data-handler='selectDay'].ui-datepicker-unselectable")
[06:17:37] * hellyeah give it a try
[06:17:38] <hellyeah> it worked nice http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/3/ but when i added hidden-xs to td it doesnt work as i expect. I expect to see whole row in the dialog box what can i do  http://jsfiddle.net/L1etpwzc/4/
[06:18:25] <DarsVaeda> I tried, it works with the custom attribute selector and the class but not in combination
[06:23:30] <decx> move the class before the attribute brackets
[06:29:44] <DarsVaeda> ah thx
[07:00:17] <workerbeetwo> is this correct to select the legendtag of fieldset ? $('#myfieldset legend') ?
[07:02:21] <Xoro> Is there something similar to example:nth-child(2n+1) in jQuery/JS?
[07:03:31] <Cork> Xoro: nth-child should work in jquery
[07:04:04] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/5zgvbjam/ why is the element in line 28 not a jquery object?
[07:05:22] <decx> each doesnt rewrap the element argument
[07:05:36] <decx> most of the time you don't need it to read the basic properties
[07:06:02] <DarsVaeda> ah so I have to foreach myself?
[07:06:18] <decx> huh? why?
[07:06:25] <decx> element is just this
[07:10:39] <Cork> DarsVaeda: $(this)
[07:10:49] <Cork> no need for ('i, element)
[07:11:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5zgvbjam/3/
[07:11:17] <DarsVaeda> ya I tried this before and it didn't work
[07:11:26] <DarsVaeda> what the hell did I do wrong...
[07:11:29] <DarsVaeda> I have no idea
[07:12:53] <druznek> hi!
[07:13:39] <druznek> i have a small question about jQuery vs Vanilla Javascript, is this the right place to ask or i should go to ##javascript?
[07:13:42] <vlt> Hello. If I have a $( ".myclass" ).click( function() {}), how do I get the next element after the clicked one?  Neither $(this).next() nor $( ".myclass" ).eq( $(this).index() + 1) seem to work. Any hint?
[07:14:44] <DarsVaeda> ah I know I must have forgotten the $ in $(this) -.-
[07:15:19] <druznek> $(this).next('.myclass') ?
[07:15:23] <decx> next() would do
[07:15:39] <decx> ask away druznek
[07:15:52] <druznek> thank you decx
[07:16:21] <druznek> how does $(document).on(event, selector, f) translate in vanilla javascript?
[07:16:23] <DarsVaeda> but beforeShow is bugged anyway or why doesn't it fire on the initial opening?
[07:17:17] <decx> document.addEventListener(event, function(e){  if (e.target && e.target.nodeName == 'SELECTOR') { dostuff()} })
[07:17:38] <druznek> cool
[07:17:41] <DarsVaeda> ah brilliant beforeShowDay fires before beforeShow :_(
[07:17:54] <DarsVaeda> +not
[07:18:05] <druznek> so decx, this snippet will catch injected DOM element?
[07:18:15] <decx> yes
[07:18:30] <druznek> performance wise, is worth the translation?
[07:18:41] <decx> jquery on is much more maintainable
[07:18:48] <decx> unless you build your own helperfunctions for it
[07:19:01] <druznek> the elements i am talking about are a lot (between 100 and 500 on average)
[07:19:25] <decx> well it's better than having 500 eventlisteners
[07:19:44] <druznek> well yes :)
[07:21:13] <DarsVaeda> what I actually try to achieve is block date ranges in the date picker (works) but I do not want overlapping, so if you pick the 8th as from date you should only be able to select dates < 14th as to date
[07:21:22] <druznek> uhm no wait a moment, i think i've not understood the thing right;
[07:21:44] <druznek> you are telling me that is better having jQuery than document.addEventListener?
[07:21:50] <DarsVaeda> any idea on this, my idea was to check which dates are blocked beforeShow and lock the rest of the dates
[07:21:59] <druznek> $(document), not jQuery, sorry
[07:22:12] <decx> it's the same thing
[07:22:34] <vlt> druznekm, decx: Doesn't $(this).next('.myclass') mean rather "take the next sibling IF it has .maclass"?
[07:22:41] <vlt> *y
[07:22:41] <decx> jquery will just add a couple of fallbacks with attachEvent for ie9 and onevent for everything else
[07:22:56] <decx> yes vlt
[07:23:11] <decx> if you want the next of that calls you do nextAll('.class').eq(0)
[07:23:14] <decx> class*
[07:23:29] <decx> if you just want the next element then next() without arguments will do just fine
[07:41:13] <HarryMilnes> Hello guys, I'm wondering if it's actually worth deferring jQuery
[07:41:39] <HarryMilnes> I want to use jQuery but a lot of the stuff is moaning that it's undefined because jQuery is deferred. and I'm tryna use it ahead of time
[07:45:09] <HarryMilnes> Of course, because I'm using jQuery and Partial Vews, deferring the code in a partial is just making it execute after the partial has loaded and not the jQuery that's in the main view.. Anyway diverted a little bit, is loading jQuery near the footer really worth it instead of the header?
[07:45:51] <plexer> im trying to make the movesectionup button disapear when at the top of the page anyone have any ideas, https://jsfiddle.net/doLcnjss/
[07:46:30] <usc911> hey guys, would it be possible to append the css !important to anyinline style that was found in the dom with jquery?
[08:22:50] <bel3atar> if I have two iframes each including a different jquery version, what version would be available to the browser's console?
[08:23:03] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[08:23:30] <robertmaxrees> the parent window's version is what you're using.
[08:29:05] <robertmaxrees> bel3atar you can access each one explicitly by trying to access the iframes directly, but that's limited by CORS.
[08:29:06] <gambl0re> what is the second most popular javascript library after jquery?
[08:29:22] <bel3atar> gambl0re: underbars
[08:29:29] <tw2113> javascript
[08:29:37] <gambl0re> also which front end javascript framework is good for a beginner?
[08:29:46] <bel3atar> gambl0re: ember.js
[08:29:50] <tw2113> depends on your needs
[08:29:50] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re depends on what your needs are.
[08:29:58] <gambl0re> ember?
[08:30:02] <tw2113> get out of my head robertmaxrees
[08:30:05] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re what are you building?
[08:30:07] <robertmaxrees> tw2113 ;)
[08:30:22] <gambl0re> i dont know...i just want to get familiar with any front end framework
[08:30:40] <Bjerre> why is this not working? $('#headHolder').html = btn3_head['header'];
[08:30:41] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re react, backbone, riot....
[08:30:49] <lholmquist> gambl0re: html
[08:30:52] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre .html is a method.
[08:31:00] <robertmaxrees> .html('your stuff here.')
[08:31:11] <Bjerre> damn ok
[08:31:26] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re there's no single "best", but there are lots of solid options.  find the right tool for the job.
[08:31:59] <gambl0re> ok which framework has the most tutorials?
[08:32:07] <robertmaxrees> terrible question.
[08:32:07] <gambl0re> that is basically what i comes down to...
[08:32:11] <Bjerre> thank you robertmaxrees
[08:32:12] <gambl0re> what it comes down to.
[08:32:16] <robertmaxrees> frameworks with tons of tutorials could be terrible.
[08:32:22] <robertmaxrees> hence necessitating lots of tutorials ;)
[08:32:34] <robertmaxrees> react, riot, backbonbe, ember, angular...
[08:32:38] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[08:32:48] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re find a thing to build first.
[08:33:00] <gambl0re> i want to do a simple to do app..
[08:33:10] <gambl0re> to do list
[08:33:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up backbone first, then.
[08:33:15] <tw2113> every single MVC framework ahs todo list tutorials
[08:33:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ todomvc will show you all your options.
[08:33:33] <tw2113> i can type, i swear
[08:33:35] <gambl0re> todomvc has the source but it doesnt teach
[08:33:47] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it's a great place to find frameworks ;)
[08:33:49] <arthurvr> TodoMVC isn’t meant to teach, no. It’s meant to compare.
[08:34:32] <robertmaxrees> imo learning how to use any framework is more important than knowing which specific one.
[08:34:36] <robertmaxrees> *to learn.
[08:35:33] <gambl0re> i know angularjs has the biggest community by i read that the learning cuve is like climbing mt kilimanjaro
[08:35:40] <PCatinean> In order to have a display: none field hidden and shown only when a certain option is picked (hover) but also on refresh if that options is selected
[08:35:42] <PCatinean> how does one do that?
[08:35:46] <PCatinean> efficiently
[08:35:50] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i'd argue "biggest community:
[08:35:54] <arthurvr> well you should learn one specific one, that’s true. Though the dicision which one you’re going to learn is important. You will totally dislike ones and love other ones.
[08:36:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ that all day
[08:36:24] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean but using .addClass() and .removeClass()
[08:36:34] <gambl0re> arthur do you have any recommendaitons for a beginner?
[08:36:51] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, but I would have to loop through all the elements and remove class if that certain option is selected yes?
[08:36:57] <PCatinean> Because I already do that
[08:37:14] <PCatinean> I see no other way
[08:37:17] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean you could pass a function to addClass
[08:37:35] <PCatinean> that would mean on a slow load the elements would be visible at first
[08:37:38] <arthurvr> gambl0re: which framework to choose you mean? No, not really. Take a look at the more popular ones first (ember, backbone, polymer, angular, …) and if you don’t like any check other ones.
[08:37:41] <PCatinean> and I still need to loop since I got 5-10 per page
[08:37:46] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean do it server-side.
[08:37:50] <robertmaxrees> that's a smarter choice
[08:37:53] <gambl0re> ok...
[08:38:13] <arthurvr> gambl0re: though if you’re going to go for angular wait till angular 2.0 matured a little. Everything is going to change.
[08:38:30] <arthurvr> just a few minutes ago I landed the todomvc angular 2 example :p
[08:38:39] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, yes you are right that is the proper way to do it, feel  "d'ooh" now that you mention it :))
[08:38:42] <PCatinean> thank you!
[08:39:07] <gambl0re> im going to try ember
[08:39:17] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re all those frameworks and libraries exist because they all bring something different to the table.  so they're all viable choices, just depends on what you're building and what you're looking for.
[08:39:46] <arthurvr> totally what robertmaxrees said. Also you’ll find that some things totally don’t fit you’re mindset and others feel wayyy better
[08:40:14] <gambl0re> ok can you just explain briefly what each framework specializes in?
[08:40:19] <robertmaxrees> uh
[08:40:21] <gambl0re> particularly ember and angular
[08:40:29] <gambl0re> and backbone
[08:40:44] <robertmaxrees> https://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison
[08:40:51] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees:  how do you like this structure? :E Do I need this many functions? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/gd2frj72/
[08:40:54] <robertmaxrees> lots of comparisons out there, gambl0re
[08:40:56] <arthurvr> I think the framework’s sites do a pretty well job at this. Also there are hunderds of blogposts about thingsl ike this.
[08:41:02] <arthurvr> s/ike/like
[08:41:08] <robertmaxrees> gj uh...
[08:41:19] <arthurvr> s/thingsl/things
[08:41:23] <robertmaxrees> err, Bjerre woah - you realize you don't need to do this.
[08:41:24] <arthurvr> I really can’t type today
[08:41:48] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre give all these a single shared class and bind to that instead.
[08:41:57] <robertmaxrees> also, you only need one document ready.
[08:42:03] <gambl0re> also how important is it to learn a js framework when looking for jobs in front end web development
[08:42:16] <Bjerre> I realise that robertmaxrees but I'm quite unsure on how to separate them from eachother. btn-one should show a different html
[08:42:26] <gambl0re> or is html/css/js/jquery enough
[08:42:28] <Bjerre> etc"
[08:42:30] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre make a functioning minimal fiddle.
[08:42:34] <arthurvr> gambl0re: depends on what you’re going to develop of course
[08:42:35] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you what you need to do.
[08:42:44] <Bjerre> ok give me a minute
[08:42:45] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re that depends, but generally you should know how to use frameworks, read documentation, etc.
[08:43:14] <arthurvr> I’d say at least make sure you have experience with some popular ones (even if it’s just an evening or two of toying with those)
[08:43:24] <gambl0re> i see
[08:45:36] <arthurvr> the real important things it that they fit your needs and your way of thinking. Not what we think.
[08:45:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:45:43] <robertmaxrees> all day every day.
[08:45:59] <robertmaxrees> stop worrying so much about what other people think or whatever.  write code, GSD, make cool shit.
[08:46:31] <arthurvr> ++robertmaxrees
[08:46:53] <robertmaxrees> learn lessons, use them down the road.
[08:47:01] <robertmaxrees> question your assumptions.  etc etc etc.
[08:47:21] <gambl0re> i want to make a site that combines facebook, google, twitter, cnn all in one
[08:47:26] <robertmaxrees> uh
[08:47:27] <gambl0re> is ember good for that?
[08:47:35] <robertmaxrees> that's awfully ambitious.
[08:48:03] <gambl0re> im a ambitious person..
[08:48:23] <arthurvr> depends on your mind more than on what we think about that. Just read some piece of code and see yourself instead of asking.
[08:48:25] <robertmaxrees> get an MVP defined for that and run for that.
[08:51:56] <nitrospectide> I need to find a script/plugin that triggers a modal window based on certain conditions (time on site, reaching bottom of page, etc… and intelligently knows not to pop it on every page. It has to run un jQ1.7.
[08:52:07] <nitrospectide> Does anyone know of anything?
[08:52:17] <robertmaxrees> nope, should be trivial to write your own, though.
[08:55:02] <gambl0re> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries why do they call bootstrap and foundation a javascript framework?
[08:57:23] <decx> what would you call them?
[08:57:31] <gambl0re> css framework
[08:58:00] <decx> but it's not just css now is it
[08:58:08] <decx> it's for widgets
[08:58:16] <decx> hence being sorted under widget ^^
[08:58:19] <gambl0re> you dont need to any javascrript in bootstrap
[08:58:34] <gambl0re> what if you just want to use the grid layout..
[08:58:37] <decx> framework means just that somebody else has done the footwork for you
[08:59:21] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re bootstrap offers tons of JS.
[08:59:28] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re what do you call jqueryUI?
[09:01:21] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees: don't mind the layout. Here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/4vzvwggo/4/
[09:02:39] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre yeah you don't need to do it this way :)
[09:02:54] <Bjerre> hehe ok, any tips robertmaxrees
[09:03:40] <robertmaxrees> first off, only use one $(function() {});
[09:05:00] <Bjerre> I really need to study some jquery
[09:05:07] <Bjerre> having hard time understanding the basics
[09:05:08] <robertmaxrees> and javascript ;)
[09:05:11] <Bjerre> yes
[09:05:13] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that does?
[09:05:26] <Bjerre> yes I do but Im not sure at all on how to combine them
[09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> on the most basic level: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4vzvwggo/5/
[09:05:44] <robertmaxrees> wrap all your code in a single one.
[09:05:57] <Bjerre> ah ofcourse
[09:06:05] <robertmaxrees> but we can also replace $tog1.click(function() { and $tog2.click(function() {
[09:06:59] <Bjerre> ye thats the worst part I believe
[09:08:34] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4vzvwggo/6/
[09:08:48] <robertmaxrees> and actually..
[09:09:10] <Bjerre> I have no idea what you just did
[09:09:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4vzvwggo/7/
[09:09:14] <Bjerre> but it works
[09:09:20] <robertmaxrees> compare and contrast.
[09:09:40] <robertmaxrees> i added an extra data attribute to each .btn that holds a relevant text value.
[09:09:50] <robertmaxrees> and i'm using that, instead of hardcoding that into the JS.
[09:11:55] <Bjerre> and data string use regular html right?
[09:11:59] <Bjerre> so <br> etc works?
[09:12:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:12:10] <robertmaxrees> don't put html in data.
[09:12:12] <Bjerre> data-text
[09:12:39] <Bjerre> well I have minimalized the jsfiddle but in actual reality I take text from external javascript
[09:12:46] <decx> yes you can use <br> in data
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> if you need something more robust, give an ID to each element and have that correspond against an object of data.
[09:13:03] <Bjerre> this is how it looks in the project         $('#headHolder').html(btn2_head['header']);
[09:13:46] <Bjerre> can I add that to +data ?
[09:13:55] <robertmaxrees> add what to data?
[09:14:02] <robertmaxrees> $('#headHolder').html(btn2_head['header']); ?
[09:14:08] <Bjerre> Im sorry it's hard to explain. Your code works great but Im just curious if it's a way of adding the text from another javascript
[09:14:09] <robertmaxrees> you could, but it's a bad idea.
[09:14:28] <Bjerre> yes
[09:14:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.,
[09:14:58] <Bjerre> well Im not sure on how I can get <b>text</b>
[09:15:05] <robertmaxrees> templating.
[09:16:01] <Bjerre> nvm robertmaxrees it worked <span class="btn btn-two" data-target="two-text" data-text="<b>button 2</b>"></span>
[09:16:11] <Bjerre> this is awesome
[09:16:15] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd look into a templating solution for that instead.
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat.
[09:16:34] <Bjerre> Thank you so much
[09:16:41] <Bjerre> haha
[09:16:48] <Bjerre> well it's good enough for me
[09:17:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:18:01] <Bjerre> how did you learn all this?
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> experience, mostly.
[09:19:24] <Bjerre> If I get in I will study javascript after summer
[09:19:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:20:00] <Bjerre> hrm?
[09:20:31] <robertmaxrees> if you get in where?
[09:20:41] <Bjerre> school
[09:20:44] <Bjerre> sorry :P
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> ah'
[09:21:14] <Bjerre> I studied 3 years of sound design but there are no jobs out there
[09:21:26] <samssh> Bjerre, Don't wait for a class. Hit up http://www.codecademy.com/
[09:21:45] <Bjerre> been trying to freelance but ended up doing web applications instead. However, as you are aware of I'm struggling
[09:21:48] <samssh>  /Then/ take the class.
[09:21:54] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre you're actually not struggling.
[09:22:04] <robertmaxrees> you're doing okay, just need some direction.
[09:22:13] <Bjerre> thank you
[09:22:41] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: Well, I know very little jQuery, and this would involve some more advanced things, like a cookie.
[09:22:44] <Bjerre> I've been trying out codeschool samssh
[09:23:24] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide sure, it would involve a couple technologies playing with each other.
[09:23:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's fine.  what's the modal for?
[09:24:25] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: newsletter subscription
[09:24:43] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide oh, that's stupid simple.
[09:25:48] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: I found one that looks interesting, but it doesn't seem to offer the ability to cookie and only show it once every X duration.
[09:26:06] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide yeah, you could do that yourself though :) it'd be a great learning experience.
[09:26:35] <robertmaxrees> although i'd argue that you should only show it once and then once the user responds, never again.
[09:27:34] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure what all of the common usage patterns are, and am just wanting to make sure it will cover the options needed based on what the site admin is requesting
[09:28:40] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees: Is it possible to have two different $this.data('text')) for headHolder and textHolder? what I mean is that I want two different data-text in each span class
[09:28:45] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: I've had "learning experiences that were interesting and enjoyable, and others that were like being kidnapped and beaten. How complicated would wrapping in a cookie be?
[09:29:09] <Bjerre> probably not possible :)
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre huh?
[09:29:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:29:54] <robertmaxrees> data-anything
[09:30:06] <Bjerre> ooooh
[09:30:18] <robertmaxrees> data-anystringhjere
[09:30:22] <Bjerre> now I get what 'text' was used for :)
[09:31:46] <sdwrage> Hey all
[09:31:58] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide very easy, especially if you use a plugin to do it.
[09:32:13] <sdwrage> Is there a plugin out there that will mask table data and then allow you to toggle the mask by clicking on said data?
[09:32:51] <Bjerre> works wonderful robertmaxrees
[09:35:56] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees you got any blog or somewhere I can follow you?
[09:40:20] <haris3> I got some work done by a designer a while ago and only just getting around to using it now. There is one file I am trying to figure out what it is: jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom
[09:40:43] <haris3> what is .custom?
[09:44:10] <Bjerre> Ok gotta go guys
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre i have a twitter account.
[09:44:13] <Bjerre> thanks again robertmaxrees
[09:44:15] <robertmaxrees> and a blog.
[09:44:18] <robertmaxrees> but nothing special.
[09:44:24] <Bjerre> same name as here rober?
[09:44:26] <Bjerre> robertmaxrees: "
[09:44:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:45:04] <Bjerre> cool. Take care mate
[09:45:07] <robertmaxrees> rad
[09:45:24] <sdwrage> Is there a plugin out there that will mask table data and then allow you to toggle the mask by clicking on said data?
[09:45:37] <sdwrage> or any data for that fact
[09:45:45] <robertmaxrees> sdwrage could you clarify your question?
[09:45:52] <robertmaxrees> that sounds awfully specific and niche
[09:45:55] <sdwrage> basically I have sensitive data
[09:46:02] <sdwrage> need to hide and show it
[09:46:02] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[09:46:10] <sdwrage> maybe replace with bullets or asterisks
[09:46:14] <sdwrage> like passwords
[09:46:23] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:46:27] <sdwrage> more for a backend dashboard
[09:46:33] <robertmaxrees> still O.o
[09:46:38] <sdwrage> to hide it from people that may walk by.
[09:46:44] <sdwrage> hey, its not my request. My companies
[09:46:49] <sdwrage> lol
[09:47:01] <robertmaxrees> uh, well... ignoring all the potential security implications, you could easily build that yourself.
[09:48:20] <sdwrage> The passwords are only visible by an admin as its an admin dashboard so no security implications
[09:48:40] <sdwrage> unless someone hacked that admin account of course
[09:56:04] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:56:12] <sdwrage> nvm found a snippet
[09:56:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm still leery about showing passwords in general, but i have to worry about PCI so meh
[10:01:50] <sdwrage> hehe
[10:02:14] <sdwrage> Not my call. They just tell me what to do and I do it
[10:02:15] <sdwrage> :P
[10:14:12] <NoiseEee> sdwrage: the idea of even storing passwords is super bad practice
[10:14:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:14:30] <robertmaxrees> that's begging for a security breach.
[10:14:41] <NoiseEee> you are already "At Fault" if that happens ^^
[10:14:47] <NoiseEee> there is zero excuse for storing passwords
[10:15:48] <NoiseEee> (unhashed passwords)
[10:16:56] <sdwrage> NoiseEee These are oauth secrets and I know.
[10:17:06] <NoiseEee> ok just putting it out there
[10:17:09] <robertmaxrees> heh./
[10:17:12] <sdwrage> :)
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd fully consider leaking that story to the press depending on who was doing it.
[10:19:17] <iamcenz> hey i dont know if this is the right place for this, but im trying to create something like http://www.canvaspop.com/create/templates but i am trying to figure out what js canvas framework to go with
[10:21:54] <NoiseEee> sdwrage: you might also think about a privacy screen for your monitor
[10:23:01] <sdwrage> NoiseEee, I luckily work from home
[10:23:07] <sdwrage> :)
[10:29:20] <plexer> https://jsfiddle.net/doLcnjss/ anyone know how to make the top button not display when at the top of the page
[10:29:51] <railbait> So I was reading about event performance and the jquery documentation mentioned being selective about how many event handlers are attached near the top of the document to avoid performance problems
[10:30:11] <railbait> I guess it's dependent on the document, but any ideas on how many/what size of a document that would cause problems with
[10:30:45] <railbait> I'm reading a coworker's code and a _lot_ (like a couple hundred) are being attached in some attempt to track clicks on this application
[10:31:30] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: Hey - thanks for the help and encouragement on wrapping that modal with a cookie integration. I used the jquery-cookie plugin, and it was very straightforward!
[10:32:04] <nitrospectide> I had no idea it could be that easy, and had originally inspected lots of pain and hair pulling
[10:32:44] <nitrospectide> *originally expected
[10:55:55] <Pazician> plexer: You could check out the Waypoints plugin or just check out scroll() and scrollTop() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7543718/test-in-jquery-if-an-element-is-at-the-top-of-screen
[10:59:44] <jop007> I have a couple of pages that must be filles in  by user at server I check all database fields there can be a long list of error messages i  am using jquery mobile what is a good way to handle this?
[11:00:37] <jop007> I tried with # links in the page but tis is not working
[11:04:39] <dimi1947> what method should I use to get the content of a textarea element?
[11:08:45] <dimi1947> I found it
[11:23:46] <katehudson> how can i add the haschange function to jquery's slick slider api
[11:55:05] <kenelliott> hello, I am working with payment gateway that does client-side encryption. I have a standard html form, with cc/ccv inputs. I encrypt them on the client and I want to replace them in the payload before it is sent out - but I don't want to show the encrypted values in the form. How can I inject them before the form is sent without modifying the inputs directly?
[11:56:12] <kenelliott> here is a jsfiddle that I am playing with http://jsfiddle.net/w6duqud5/2/
[11:57:05] <kenelliott> ignore my super l33t encryption method :D
[11:59:33] <kenelliott> hmm.. i guess I could remove the name's from the cc/ccv inputs and then have some hidden inputs that I inject the correct values into. thoughts...anyone.
[12:00:55] <arc_> to me that seems like a question for /join #python
[12:01:15] <arc_> but who knows
[12:01:19] <kenelliott> arc_: me?
[12:01:36] <arc_> ya
[12:01:42] <arc_> oh before it's sent, you said
[12:01:55] <kenelliott> haha right. i had a very confused look on my face :D
[12:04:59] <arc_> i don't know how to solve your problem, but out of curiosity, what is the purpose of what you're doing
[12:05:43] <robertmaxrees> whats going on?
[12:06:17] <arc_> did you just join? (i have join/part turned off)
[12:06:19] <robertmaxrees> kenelliott you can't edit the payload without decrypting and re-encrypting.
[12:06:23] <arc_> ok nvm
[12:06:26] <robertmaxrees> i was away from my desk for a while.
[12:07:02] <kenelliott> sure, braintree - a popular payment gateway encrypts credit card information on the client side. Normally this information gets sent directly to braintree, however we are a proxy for this information.
[12:07:11] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[12:07:23] <robertmaxrees> have you checked with them to make sure that's OK?  because that's sketchy
[12:07:31] <kenelliott> so it gets sent to us first, we don't save it - just pass it through.
[12:07:46] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> have you checked with them about that?
[12:07:54] <kenelliott> yes, it is PCI DSS compliant
[12:08:00] <robertmaxrees> your side or theirs?
[12:08:17] <robertmaxrees> also: what are you editing in the cc/ccv?
[12:08:21] <kenelliott> nothing
[12:08:44] <kenelliott> i'm encrypting it using their encryption code.
[12:09:03] <kenelliott> https://github.com/braintree/braintree-web
[12:09:06] <robertmaxrees> "I encrypt them on the client and I want to replace them in the payload before it is sent out" - what are you replacing then?
[12:09:23] <kenelliott> ok, let me start over because we have gone on a tangent :)
[12:09:42] <kenelliott> this is an example of what I am doing http://jsfiddle.net/w6duqud5/2/
[12:09:57] <kenelliott> i want to submit the form, but accomplish two things
[12:10:07] <kenelliott> not sending the cleartext cc info
[12:10:18] <kenelliott> and not replacing the input with the encrypted cc info
[12:11:02] <kenelliott> my question was could I replace the 'number' and 'ccv' before it gets sent out without changing the form inputs (as visible to the user)
[12:11:05] <kenelliott> it appears that I can't
[12:11:19] <robertmaxrees> because you're sending the form to yourself first?
[12:11:24] <kenelliott> correct
[12:11:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to send it to yourself?
[12:11:55] <kenelliott> we are a proxy for the braintree payments
[12:12:15] <robertmaxrees> why
[12:13:36] <kenelliott> because that is our business? we are a payment gateway proxy for braintree. We are level 2 PCI compliant.
[12:13:37] <saransh__> hi, in the navigation menu, how to keep the state of the clicked list-item active?
[12:13:54] <saransh__> in the next page
[12:14:04] <kenelliott> this is all legit and not sketchy..hah
[12:14:09] <robertmaxrees> kenelliott i'm not grokking something here then.
[12:14:17] <robertmaxrees> your business is literally as a proxy for braintree?
[12:15:09] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't understand what data you're trying to intercept here - their documentation seems pretty solid and explains how to do a standard setup pretty clearly.
[12:15:18] <kenelliott> we are a payment gateway for the telecom industry, ie cell phones. Our payment system sends authorizations through braintree.
[12:15:20] <arc_> i guess it probably is something like a cdn for payments
[12:15:30] <arc_> just to speed up the transaction
[12:15:32] <robertmaxrees> aaaah okay, you're operating as a gateway.
[12:15:34] <arc_> depending on your location
[12:15:36] <kenelliott> bingo
[12:15:47] <robertmaxrees> okay - i work in ecommerce so i'm familiar with the basic idea :)
[12:16:02] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what in their docs isn't clear?  they explain exactly this setup pretty well.
[12:16:03] <kenelliott> great.. ok back to my simple question :)
[12:16:51] <kenelliott> actually I've surmised that the answer is "no" i can't replace a field in the payload with jquery before sending it. Unless I use an ajax request.
[12:17:01] <saransh__> http://pastebin.com/XZpwDsrm
[12:17:09] <robertmaxrees> kenelliott it's encrypted, so nope.  you'd have to edit it pre-encryption.
[12:17:12] <kenelliott> We have a client who is using a simple approach and I'm trying to make it work for them.
[12:17:18] <saransh__> and for live url http://beaconstac.staging.wpengine.com
[12:17:19] <robertmaxrees> what's their approach?
[12:17:41] <robertmaxrees> saransh__ your server needs to add a class to the thing you want to be marked as "active"
[12:18:18] <kenelliott> I think I have found the solution actually, if I remove the name from a form input it will not be part of the payload - is that correct?
[12:18:27] <robertmaxrees> kenelliott that depends on each browser.
[12:18:32] <kenelliott> shit - ok.
[12:18:41] <robertmaxrees> and braintree's apis may or may not respect that.
[12:18:47] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to replace inputs?
[12:19:02] <graphettion> Can anyone help me with prettyPhoto? It's not showing the background correctly. - http://prod.c2ti.com/pcori/conference-atlanta/#prettyPhoto/0/
[12:19:18] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[12:19:29] <plexer> Pazician thanks just used scroll() and scrollTop() worked great
[12:19:46] <Pazician> :)
[12:19:56] <graphettion> It's driving me crazy. Been at this for a while.
[12:24:48] <saransh__> <robermaxrees>: It is not workin
[12:24:59] <saransh__> I gave a class to list items
[12:28:50] <Es0teric> has anyone here used fullpagejs?
[12:32:27] <saransh__> can anyone tell,  how can we keep class added by on click method active on other pages?
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> saransh__ you can't.
[12:32:39] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it server-side.
[12:33:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll wind up doing some kind of funky hack.
[12:33:19] <saransh__> how on server side?
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> the server detects what page the user requested and puts a class on a particular element.
[12:34:41] <saransh__> <robertmaxrees>: thanks :)
[12:40:52] <Es0teric> how do i force jquery to add a class to a specific element when .addClass() doesn't do it?
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:41:00] <robertmaxrees> that does it.
[12:41:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees not for me
[12:41:18] <Es0teric> it doesn't add it at all
[12:41:18] <robertmaxrees> proof.
[12:42:13] <graphettion> $('#element').addClass('nameOfClass');
[12:42:17] <graphettion> always worked for me
[12:42:37] <graphettion> Can anyone help me with prettyPhoto? It's not showing the white background correctly. - http://prod.c2ti.com/pcori/conference-atlanta/#prettyPhoto/0/
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> graphettion you're not likely to get help with your full site fwiw
[12:43:19] <robertmaxrees> i'
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> *i'm also not seeing the bug - what's the issue?
[12:44:44] <graphettion> Go here: http://prod.c2ti.com/pcori/conference-atlanta/. Scroll down until you see a green link: Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options
[12:44:48] <graphettion> click on that
[12:44:49] <acidjazz> man i dont get it
[12:44:56] <acidjazz> chrome jsut is completely ignoring all fonts
[12:45:00] <graphettion> (In the Event Schedule)
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> graphettion inspect the element.
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[12:45:50] <graphettion> Already did.
[12:46:03] <robertmaxrees> .pp_content has its height set to like 35 px
[12:46:08] <graphettion> Exactly.
[12:46:21] <graphettion> I'm not sure how to change that in the jQuery.
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:46:26] <graphettion> Don't want to mess the template up.
[12:46:52] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions - "A reduced test case is the minimum amount of code required to reproduce your issue. If you link someone to 2000 lines of unrelated HTML, CSS and Javascript, they're very likely to close the browser and spend some quality time with their families instead."
[12:47:14] <robertmaxrees> :) help me out a bit here - do you have a test case or anything else i can see?
[12:47:19] <graphettion> Yeah, works everywhere else. I guess something is overriding it.
[12:47:34] <graphettion> Whatevs. Thanks.
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> so you're going to make somebody else do a bunch of legwork to find the js, css, etc?
[12:47:55] <decx> your href is hidden
[12:47:59] <robertmaxrees> like, we can try to help but you're not really giving me much to go off of.
[12:48:00] <graphettion> Did I say that?
[12:48:03] <decx> and as such it doesnt have a height
[12:48:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i am going to make a fiddle real quick
[12:48:12] <decx> so prettyphoto dont know
[12:48:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not really giving me much to work with...
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[12:48:21] <decx> so you get the minimum height
[12:48:22] <decx> there
[12:48:53] <graphettion> I cannot reproduce it with a sample because it works there. Yet doesn't work on this.
[12:49:10] <graphettion> So something has to be overriding I'm guessing.
[12:49:17] <graphettion> Not sure how to send you a sample of that.
[12:49:28] <decx> i just gave you the answer bro
[12:51:01] <graphettion> My href is hidden?
[12:51:28] <decx> inspect your link
[12:51:41] <decx> few lines under that is <div id="inline-1" class="hide">
[12:51:49] <decx> this is what your script loads into the lightbox
[12:52:01] <decx> wuth href="#inline-1"
[12:52:09] <decx> but it's on display:none so it doesnt have a height
[12:52:15] <decx> and your script has no idea
[12:52:37] <decx> instead of hiding with display: none; you could hide with visibility: hidden; position: absolute;
[12:52:45] <decx> and your ligthbox will have the right height
[12:53:09] <decx> i can do that live in the inspector then click the link and it works
[12:53:32] <graphettion> Weird. The site told me to put that. http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/
[12:53:48] <graphettion> kk, cool, ty
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> graphettion i'm not trying to be a jerk fwiw, just trying to get information up front.  that's all.
[12:54:28] <graphettion> Oh, I know. It's not you. It's just this thing has been frustrating me for hours and it's something so small.
[12:54:37] <decx> literally too small
[12:54:39] <decx> lulz
[12:54:41] <graphettion> ^
[12:55:19] <graphettion> I can't reproduce it anywhere else. I've tried till I couldn't try anymore. That's why I came here, lol.
[12:55:29] <graphettion> I'll try decx and see if that works.
[12:55:33] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to say "tell me what line(s) in what file(s) you want me to start with"
[12:55:45] <graphettion> ooo
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:55:50] <graphettion> Misunderstood.
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> decx's solution is probably right though
[12:55:58] <decx> i didnt even look at the js
[12:56:05] <decx> it's a common thing with loading hidden content
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> i was more making a stink about folks coming in here and expecting me to do a bunch of extra legwork they've already done.
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> i'll have to investigate - tell me what you know.
[12:56:49] <decx> ye graphettion just got lucky
[12:56:50] <decx> ^^
[12:56:51] <graphettion> No, not at all. You are taking time out of your busy day to help others.
[12:56:56] <graphettion> I really respect that.
[12:58:18] <decx> also i'm digging roboto for these titles
[12:58:33] <decx> doesnt look as good in the preview
[12:58:35] <robertmaxrees> unf
[12:58:36] <decx> so i never used it
[12:59:03] <decx> the font roboto that is
[12:59:26] <arc_> it's good
[12:59:30] <arc_> but it's better for hi dpi displays
[12:59:55] <decx> ah bad low res
[13:00:02] <decx> oh well
[13:00:59] <arc_> i wouldn't say bad, just that there are better fonts for ~100 dpi
[13:01:26] <arc_> it was designed for mobile, so 200+ dpi
[13:02:45] <graphettion> dexc: So I change the hide class?
[13:08:40] <Es0teric> hey robertmaxrees  you there?
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> for a few more.
[13:10:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/2s5ad87v/2/
[13:10:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/2s5ad87v/3/
[13:10:47] <Es0teric> there it is
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> and this replicates the bug?
[13:11:35] <morlenxus> Hey, i have a jqueryui related question: When loading a dialog with tabs i use height: "auto" to have the dialog resize to the content hight. This works _until_ i move the dialog to another position. Example: http://office.5monkeys.kicks-ass.net/test.php  This seems to be Firefox related, Google Chrome works.
[13:11:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah
[13:11:40] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?
[13:11:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i am trying to attach the fixedHeader class to header_container
[13:11:58] <Es0teric> on scroll down but i am using fullpagejs
[13:12:01] <Es0teric> so its acting wierd as hell
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> what does that class do?
[13:12:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees adds a position:fixed
[13:12:47] <Es0teric> thats it
[13:13:00] <Es0teric> because i want the header to retain position when the user scrolls down
[13:13:21] <morlenxus> Any help with that issue?
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> why not just add the class on pageload, Es0teric?
[13:13:31] <graphettion> decx: Spelled your name wrong. So I change the hide class?
[13:13:48] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees because thats not what i want
[13:19:56] <Vanesco> Hi, I'm using jquery-ui.mulidatespicker and i'm getting a weird error when i click a date to select it. If i step through the code i can see that 'date' changes from typeof string to typeof function.. which then causes it to explode.. any ideas ?
[13:20:52] <Vanesco> Uncaught Error: Conversion from "string" format not allowed on jQuery.multiDatesPicker
[13:22:35] <Vanesco> I think it's a bug that it says 'string' right there.. if i see the code. http://pastebin.com/GwZDVyYt it says 'desired_format' in both switch statements, where i believe the first should be from_format
[13:23:36] <Vanesco> the error is thrown from jquery.min.js so I'm having a hard time to see where it changes from typeof string, to typeof function
[13:27:06] <Es0teric> infact does anyone know how to replicate the scroll in this? http://www.inlist.com/
[13:36:16] <graphettion> yay! I wwwwwwwwwwwwworked!!!
[13:36:34] <graphettion> Much thanks decx and robertmaxrees
[13:41:20] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: What part of it?
[13:46:29] <Scroll_Tro0L> Heya, any idea why this doesn't work? $('.commentPlural')[commentCount == 1 ? 'hide' : 'show']();
[13:46:35] <Scriptonaut> Hey guys, I have a .show(300) on a form. It causes the page to scroll down when the bottom of the form collides with the bottom of the screen. Does anyone know how I can make the scroll stay still, and just have the stuff expand below the screen?
[13:49:22] <BillCriswell> Scroll_Tro0L: Any errors?
[13:49:34] <Scroll_Tro0L> Not for the Ternary, no.
[13:49:50] <Scroll_Tro0L> This is within socket.io. Oddly, I get an error for console.log()
[13:49:57] <Scroll_Tro0L> function not found or something
[13:50:56] <Scroll_Tro0L> Oh hey, thanks BillCriswell, it seems you scared the problem away.
[13:51:11] <Scroll_Tro0L> Everything magically decided to work now.
[13:52:09] <BillCriswell> Scroll_Tro0L: Nice.
[13:52:24] <BillCriswell> One thing though, you should consider using toggleClass and hiding and showing that way.
[13:52:33] <matthewk> doing an ajax type POST and with a simple data: { 'a':'b'} , i'm getting source: [object Object] for the parameters when i inspect in firebug. why is it not showing a: b ?
[13:52:38] <BillCriswell> jQuery's hide and show does a lot more work that you probably don't need to do
[13:52:46] <Scroll_Tro0L> It's an english thing: http://puu.sh/irrpl/2c9aaa73d8.png
[13:52:51] <Scroll_Tro0L> bottom right
[13:53:01] <Scroll_Tro0L> 0 should be plural, 1 should be singular, everything else should be plural
[13:53:41] <Scroll_Tro0L> Would toggle eb efficient for that?
[13:53:55] <matthewk> i've got processData: false and dataType: 'text'
[13:54:01] <Scroll_Tro0L> Thing is, if for some reason I decide to put a polling time to where comment counts can jump from 0 -> 2
[13:54:10] <Scroll_Tro0L> I dont want it to toggle the "s" in comments
[13:54:19] <BillCriswell> I tend to do like $('.foo').toggleClass('something', count === 1);
[13:54:37] <Scroll_Tro0L> How does that work?
[13:54:52] <BillCriswell> If count === 1 it adds that class, otherwise it removes it
[13:55:16] <Scroll_Tro0L> Oh, that does sound much better then
[13:55:25] <matthewk> could someone help me on my ajax question?
[13:56:26] <Scroll_Tro0L> BillCriswell: Should be good? $('.commentPlural').toggleClass('show', commentCount !== 1);
[13:56:56] <BillCriswell> That's how I'd approach it more than likely.
[13:57:20] <Scroll_Tro0L> Awesome, thanks for that.
[13:57:24] <BillCriswell> matthewk: When you inspect what in firebug?
[13:57:28] <BillCriswell> Scroll_Tro0L: No problem at all.
[13:57:31] <Scroll_Tro0L> I've been in mysql hell for so long, loosing my UI touch.
[13:57:44] <matthewk> the POST in the console
[13:58:11] <matthewk> Source [object Object]
[13:58:48] <matthewk> BillCriswell: i would expect a: b to show there, since that's what the data is i supplied
[13:59:33] <BillCriswell> do you have like var data = { a: 'b' }; and you're doing console.log(data); and you're getting [object Object] ?
[14:01:26] <BillCriswell> matthewk: I do much better with some code in front of me.
[14:01:31] <matthewk> var data = { 'a': 'b' }; console.log(data);     $.ajax({         type: 'POST',         data: data,         dataType: 'text',         processData: false     })
[14:01:43] <matthewk>  Object { a="b"}
[14:02:01] <matthewk> source / parameters on the Post tab show: [object Object]
[14:03:37] <matthewk> BillCriswell: does that make sense ?
[14:05:02] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you want processData false?
[14:06:13] <matthewk> BillCriswell: i can remove it to see if it makes a difference. i don't know why that would ever need processing...
[14:06:54] <matthewk> BillCriswell: that seems to solve it , so it's no longer doing [object object]
[14:07:05] <BillCriswell> That's good I think.
[14:08:06] <matthewk> BillCriswell: thanks for your kind help :)
[14:08:17] <BillCriswell> No problem at all! Glad it was something so simple haha
[14:09:06] <matthewk> :)
[14:16:30] <arc_> is that supposed to be an eee pc reference
[14:38:34] <katehudson> how yas doin

[14:41:57] <Zzaichik> kickin it, live baby pop
[14:44:30] <ght> Does anyone see why this extremely brief code segment would fail to pull the current value of the form element with .val()? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f412d4067d2f2af3a155
[14:44:58] <ght> that .each statement is returning the value of the HTML "value=" field in the form element, and not the current value of the input
[14:46:00] <arc_> i'm surprised it's doing that even. you're selecting the td, but you need to select the input element
[14:46:13] <arc_> also it's better to use console log than alert for debugging
[14:46:40] <Zzaichik> ght: got's to target the inputs yo.
[14:46:55] <Zzaichik> yeah, what arc_ said
[14:47:07] <ght> Zzaichik: I've been researching on the web for hours, do you happen to know the code modification needed here?
[14:47:22] <ght> I've tried utilizing .attr(), .html()
[14:47:51] <ght> Read about a hundred stack overflow posts.
[14:47:58] <arc_> you can change $(this) on line 5 to $('input')
[14:48:00] <tasaif> ght, http://jsfiddle.net/qco15q4w/1/
[14:48:08] <Zzaichik> where it says ('td') - make it say ('td input')
[14:48:18] <arc_> or that is another way of doing it
[14:48:28] <Zzaichik> there's a few ways, no doubt. :)
[14:48:31] <ght> Trying these now, I really, really appreciate the help.
[14:48:58] <arc_> i've never seen this -> syntax. what is that accomplishing here
[14:49:05] <tasaif> (it's coffeescript)
[14:49:07] <Zzaichik> coffeescript
[14:49:12] <arc_> i see

[14:49:19] <Zzaichik> Yep - it's aight
[14:49:44] <tasaif> sorry :}
[14:49:48] <Zzaichik> hahhah
[14:50:39] <ght> arc_: Tried suggestion one, changing this to 'input', and now it's returning checkboxes for all values for some unknown reason.
[14:50:50] <ght> Now trying altering to ('td input') and reverting to this.
[14:51:14] <Zzaichik> aw snap - I bet i'll work
[14:51:18] <arc_> checkboxes...?
[14:51:18] <Zzaichik> it'll*
[14:51:29] <Zzaichik> yeah that is weird. There aren't checkboxes.
[14:51:36] <tasaif> (let it go)
[14:51:48] <arc_> ya w/e doesn't matter
[14:52:55] <ght> 'td input' appears to have done it, thank you kindly Zzaichik.
[14:53:23] <Zzaichik> or this. $(this).children('td').find("input").each ->
[14:53:30] <Zzaichik> same diff

[15:19:34] <tasaif> use draggable
[15:19:42] <ArtVandelay> draggable contents?
[15:19:51] <tasaif> https://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[15:20:31] <ArtVandelay> that doesnt do shit in actual practice
[15:20:46] <tasaif> what do you mean?
[15:20:53] <ArtVandelay> if this was diablo II id say yes
[15:20:59] <ArtVandelay> otherwise when are u going to use that
[15:21:06] <tasaif> for the slider handle
[15:21:35] <ArtVandelay> how can i tag pagination to that
[15:22:02] <tasaif> you said you're building a slider?
[15:22:17] <ArtVandelay> yeah i want to tag hash change pagination to it
[15:22:52] <tasaif> build the slider first, then worry about pagination
[15:22:57] <skinux> JSHint doesn't seem to be telling me anything
[15:23:00] <tasaif> also, why are you building a slider?
[15:23:19] <tasaif> skinux there should be a small red thing that shows up next to your code
[15:23:21] <ArtVandelay> as a project portfolio slider, i want to be able to go through has changes, boom, boom, boom, like a catalog
[15:23:35] <ArtVandelay> hash changes*
[15:23:50] <tasaif> why not use a slider that already exists?
[15:23:52] <ArtVandelay> each slide will have a hash url, and i want to go through those boom shocka locka
[15:24:15] <tasaif> like this for example
[15:24:15] <tasaif> https://jqueryui.com/slider/
[15:24:27] <tasaif> (which likely implements the draggable library)
[15:24:33] <skinux> Am I doing it wrong by putting tinymce.init inside of document.ready(function() ?
[15:24:34] <ArtVandelay> i cant find onno
[15:24:43] <ArtVandelay> no thats jap city i dont want anything to do with that slider
[15:24:58] <tasaif> what do you mean?
[15:25:32] <ArtVandelay> thats no good
[15:25:55] <tasaif> skinux, no, that shouldn't cause problems, but you don't need it on jsfiddle
[15:26:02] <tasaif> ArtVandelay, why not?
[15:26:13] <ArtVandelay> each slide div needs to be a hash change
[15:27:17] <tasaif> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/
[15:27:29] <tasaif> use a step value and bind to the 'stop' event
[15:29:13] <skinux> Well, no matter what I try, I can't get TinyMCE to show.
[15:29:42] <tasaif> skinux, one sec
[15:31:14] <tasaif> skinux, http://jsfiddle.net/dj3j9k26/
[15:32:22] <tasaif> ArtVandelay, did that solve it?
[15:35:37] <tasaif> skinux, do you have any questions?
[15:52:33] <skinux> I changed to what you provided and it still isn't working.
[15:53:39] <skinux> http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/L0e2un6g/1/
[16:01:56] <tasaif> skinux, you have a syntax error
[16:02:01] <tasaif> look at your console
[16:02:09] <skinux> I just did.
[16:02:59] <skinux> http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/L0e2un6g/2/
[16:03:22] <tasaif> the tinymce library is not linked correctly
[16:03:50] <tasaif> you want to link to this //tinymce.cachefly.net/4.0/tinymce.min.js
[16:03:50] <skinux> Well, then I don't know how to do it on JSFiddle
[16:04:10] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/L0e2un6g/3/
[16:04:40] <tasaif> your next problem is you're selecting all textareas with the class 'content'
[16:04:52] <tasaif> however, in your html, the text area only has the name 'content'
[16:05:09] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/L0e2un6g/6/
[16:06:43] <tasaif> lastly, it looks like the inline: is breaking it for some reason
[16:06:51] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/L0e2un6g/8/
[16:10:04] <skinux> I added class="content" to the textarea and it's still not working.
[16:10:23] <wa5ted> what
[16:11:35] <skinux> Trying to get TinyMCE working as a jQuery plugin
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:25:26] <tasaif> skinux, did you click the last jsfiddle?
[16:28:00] <Sal> jquery ajax calls return stranbge characters
[16:28:22] <Sal> do i need to insert some utg-8 stuff in the html?
[16:28:41] <Sal> or do i need to let php send a header before the html?
[16:29:10] <Guest27934> Sal can you screenshot?
[16:29:20] <Sal> yep
[16:29:23] <skinux> tasif: Yes.
[16:30:47] <Sal> should be like this: http://i.imgur.com/5Ng43Sc.png
[16:31:15] <Sal> but returns this: http://i.imgur.com/DBMmQ7H.png
[16:31:33] <Sal> the first calling the html by browser
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> bad character encoding.
[16:31:41] <Sal> the second calling html by ajax
[16:32:04] <Sal> yes, but i can't get it to work
[16:32:23] <Sal> should i send a header from php before the echo of html?
[16:32:33] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[16:32:45] <Sal> damn
[16:41:13] <skinux> tasif: I'm using what you put in the last JSFiddle and it's still not working.
[16:41:52] <skinux> Does TinyMCE need to be told to show a WYSIWYG type interface???
[16:43:27] <robertmaxrees> check the docs
[16:44:32] <skinux> Wait. TinyMCE does initialize and hide the paragraph tags, but it isn't showing any buttons whatsoever.
[16:47:16] <tasaif> Sal robertmaxrees could it be a font problem?
[16:47:32] <robertmaxrees> Sal's issue is an encoding problem.
[16:47:38] <tasaif> for sure?
[16:47:42] <robertmaxrees> if it works fine outside of the ajax setup, yes
[16:49:58] <skinux> Got it.
[16:50:19] <robertmaxrees> tasaif that usually means that the browser is assuming one encoding, but is recieving data in another.
[16:50:44] <skinux> I had to add setting to have a toolbar and I had to set inline to false. Sheesh, by default TinyMCE does NOTHING.
[16:51:10] <robertmaxrees> skinux http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L0e2un6g/9/
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> works find with just the selector.
[16:52:36] <skinux> Well, wouldn't for me.
[16:59:50] <walabe> could someone please help me make a plugin responsive
[16:59:55] <walabe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30868965/how-to-make-this-jquery-plugin-responsive-spritespin
[17:00:23] <walabe> And any idea why it's quite slow
[17:03:08] <tasaif> okie dokie
[17:20:35] <walabe> can no one help with my issue?
[17:34:20] <BytesAndCoffee> how do i return a value through a deferred promise?
[17:42:09] <kevireilly> walabe: what happens when you use media queries?
[17:42:37] <walabe> What? I dunno, it changes on different sizes?
[17:42:44] <walabe> Are you saying use media queries for my problem?
[17:46:03] <kevireilly> walabe: sorry, just realized you didn't mean responsive in that sense. Part of the problem of the slowness is that you've got full page repaints taking place
[17:47:32] <kevireilly> walabe: what I mean by that is when you rotate the watch, every potential movement requires the browser to do a lot of work to show you a visible change
[17:48:44] <kevireilly> walabe: I'm wrong, just so happens that the canvas was filling up the full screen leading me to believe it was a full page repaint
[18:03:28] <walabe> oh right, thanks kevireilly
[18:05:15] <kevireilly> walabe: how large are these images?
[18:05:42] <walabe> Pretty large, like 2000px wide, but they are being resized by the jquery
[18:06:13] <walabe> main issue is making the plugin resize depending on the browser width. Would this answer solution work in my situation? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14039608/how-to-make-rhonoslider-responsive?rq=1
[19:43:45] <zeroquake> Anyone know if regex based matching is possible with eslint?
[21:02:39] <ght> Question: Earlier, Zzaichik and arc_ were kind enough to help me figure out how to properly get the current value of an input within a table usint a .each loop, by specifying "td input".each.
[21:03:08] <ght> Well I just noticed that one last issue remains. The table includes a dropdown <select> statement for "schedule", as seen here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/edf970830dace3a68a86
[21:04:42] <ght> The .each specifying "td input" is now working for the text inputs, but the select inputs are returning "false"
[21:04:42] <Max-P> ght: .find('td input, td select')
[21:05:22] <ght> Max-P: So, within that code, the .each line is: $(this).find("td input").each ->
[21:05:27] <ght> In that brief gist I posted.
[21:05:40] <ght> so if I change it to .find("td input, td select") the issue should be resolved?
[21:05:44] <Max-P> Yep
[21:05:54] <ght> Awesome, will try that now, thank you kindly.
[21:07:37] <Max-P> Alternatively, wrap that whole thing in a <form>, and pure Javascript conveniently give you access to all the data: document.getElementById('my-form').elements.forEach(function(e) { console.log(e.id, e.value); });
[21:10:23] <vlt> Hello. If I have a $( ".myclass" ).click( function() {}), how do I get the next element (of the total list) after the clicked one?  Neither $(this).next() nor $( ".myclass" ).eq( $(this).index() + 1) nor nextAll( ".myclass" ).eq(0) seem to work. Any hint? http://jsfiddle.net/1t18jasp/3/
[21:10:26] <Max-P> Or alternatively^2, jQuery apparently also has .find(':input'), which will pick all possible input fields ever (so textareas, radios)
[21:13:03] <Max-P> vlt: I don't understand the question. What do you want exactly? Your example seems to be working for me
[21:14:26] <Max-P> vlt: Also, there's no need to $(set) every time. "set" is already a jQuery object, so $(set) does nothing at all.
[21:15:17] <Max-P> And also consider using "var set". Global variables are evil and should only be used in some very rare cases where you really want to create a global from somewhere that's not the root scope
[21:15:19] <vlt> Max-P: Does it work when you click on the very last <li> element?
[21:15:48] <Max-P> vlt: What is it supposed to do when you click the last item?
[21:16:00] <Max-P> Oh, nevermind
[21:16:24] <vlt> Max-P: addClass("red") to the first <p class="yes">
[21:19:21] <Max-P> vlt: http://jsfiddle.net/1t18jasp/4/
[21:21:45] <Max-P> Basically instead of having jQuery use .each() internally, we use it ourself so we know the index of the current item, and add it an onclick listener closure that uses that index to know the next element in the array
[21:22:54] <vlt> Max-P: Thank you! Makes sense.  The "var" keyword makes it a local variable? And is using "$set" instead of just "set" a jQuery convention?
[21:24:02] <vlt> Max-P: And last question: any idea why my approach failed for that one last <li> element?
[21:24:07] <Uhkis> own preference, i tend to use $name for jquery objects and plain name for normals
[21:24:13] <Max-P> vlt: Yes, var makes any variable local. For example, "i" in this example cannot be used outside of the function. And similarly, if this whole snippet was in another function, "$set" wouldn't be available outside either
[21:24:49] <Max-P> $name is not an official recommendation but several people do because it makes it clear it's a jQuery object. But really you use regular names and it will work just fine
[21:27:11] <Max-P> vlt: Your approach failed simply because next() (and its variants) check its direct siblings, so it never went outside of <ul>. If it worked outside of it, I would imagine it would be pretty expensive, but the real reason is probably just that nobody had a use case for it
[21:29:51] <vlt> Max-P: Great explanations, thank you!
[21:32:12] <vlt> Does it make sense at all to store $("<selector>") into var $set or did I over-optimize here because jQuery doesn't walk through the whole domunent anyways for each new call of $("<selector>")?
[21:32:28] <vlt> *document
[21:34:01] <Max-P> vlt: Yes, it does. And in this example, it is very important, because if the document ever changes to add more yes to it, th assumption about the meaning of "i" will get invalidated
[21:34:32] <Max-P> Also, class selectors aren't too expensive, but it sure is more expensive to do it all the time if you need it only once
[21:37:39] <Max-P> The thing is, better optimize the trivial stuff when you can than just do a dirty job and bang your head making small changes after the fact
[21:47:57] <vlt> Is there an easy way to make removeClass() and then addClass() "softer"? A way to make the "background-color: red;" fade out and fade in on the next element? http://jsfiddle.net/1t18jasp/4/
[21:48:37] <Max-P> vlt: http://jsfiddle.net/1t18jasp/6/
[21:48:51] <Max-P> CSS transitions are neat
[21:49:21] <Max-P> And you can pretty much forget about IE8 for such details, as this is not an essential animation like a menu or anything.
[21:49:42] <Max-P> Otherwise you'd want to use .animate() on the element
[21:50:10] <vlt> Max-P: This is beautiful.
[21:50:55] <vlt> Max-P: I write code that doesn't work in IE on purpose ;-)
[21:51:55] <Max-P> vlt: You should never target any browser in particular. Stick to the standards. This way if it doesn't work on the browser, it's the browser that doesn't respect the standard.
[21:54:01] <Max-P> Since IE9/10, most of the stuff will just work out of the box anyway. Microsoft really got their shit together with the recent IE versions, the deserve props for the effort. They were massively behind with a huge technical debt to support both newer standards *and* older standard (for which many enterprise clients paid huge bucks for it to stay so their crappy IE5.5 Intranet application doesn't need to be updated)
[21:57:18] <vlt> Max-P: I know. I never do this. Almost never. Though in the (intranet) app I'm writing there are several occurances of sleep() if the Browser identifies as something something IE :-D
[21:57:18] <Max-P> And of course use new vender-specific stuff with care: stick to extras. It was bad back in the days when Netscape added stuff on their own, it's still as bad today. We don't want users to, for example, jump all Chrome and make it the new default browser. There's already enough half-backed hacks built into Javascript from the old days where it was just "extras", we really, really don't need more. Standards FTW, it's important to take the time to make sure the new
[21:58:18] * vlt is the choir 
[21:59:03] <Max-P> Totally going to break when users upgrade to Edge, he.
[21:59:38] <vlt> (... Max-P is preaching to, just to explain)
[22:00:42] <Max-P> Oh I totally don't care a minute about IE. But I do care about the standards, and choice. I don't even have IE on my machine, so, you can be sure I'm not an IE fan :P
[22:54:53] <kevireilly_> it can be a lil more readable too since you can then refer to it with a potentially more meaningful name
[22:56:11] <kevireilly_> but function calls aren’t free, doing it once is beneficial when the same jquery object needs to be used more than once
[22:56:42] * kevireilly_ just realized he may be looking at old messages
[23:03:09] <Max-P> kevireilly: about an hour old, not _too_ bad
