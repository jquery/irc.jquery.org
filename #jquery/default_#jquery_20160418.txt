[01:27:23] <aro> whats the best way to send a large amount of data over ajax?
[01:27:33] <aro> i am trying to send a data:image/png;base64 stream
[01:33:40] <BenderRodriguez> I'm not sure of a "best" way
[01:33:52] <BenderRodriguez> regardless of what methods you use you're still using AJAX to send the data
[02:07:25] <Cork> aro: there isn't really a best way it will be inefficient basically how every you do it
[02:08:16] <Cork> aro: you could possibly try gzip the data before sending it, but as far as i know gzip ing post data isn't commonly supported in browsers (you might be able to do it with js)

[07:05:27] <vdeep> neo12 what do you mean by default text?
[07:06:57] <neo12> i have a textarea with a some initial text inside (e.g. enter something), want it to clear when user starts typing
[07:15:34] <neo12> nvm
[07:20:00] <aro> use placeholder :P
[07:20:08] <aro> @neo
[07:27:57] <Duikboot> I have some link now with terms & conditions. I want to keep the same page open and show them someone a nice idea how to show the terms and cnditions text?

[07:28:11] <Duikboot> a lightbox is so boring .. but terms and conditions are as well.. yeah that's right
[07:28:12] <dotcom> I am a programmer
[08:28:52] <neo12> is there a js reset equivalent for jquery?
[08:29:10] <neo12> i'm trying to reset the placeholder text
[08:29:20] <neo12> on textarea
[08:59:52] <Kartagis> neo12: what do you mean reset?
[09:02:26] <neo12> Kartagis: i have a placeholder attr on textarea, which disappears when user begins to type. I'd like to reset the input field when user closes and opens the model again
[09:02:29] <neo12> modal*
[09:02:33] <neo12> make sense?
[09:02:41] <vaindil> I'm using a userscript to autofill a datepicker, but I can't get the output to format properly. It's being pasted as 'MM/DD/YYYY', but I need it as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. I tried calling format and formatDate, but neither of them works.
[09:02:58] <vaindil> I'm trying to use datepicker.('setDate', newdate)
[09:11:12] <Kartagis> neo12: placeholders are meant to disappear when user begins to type
[09:11:35] <neo12> right!
[09:11:49] <neo12> i'd like to reset the placeholder once the modal closes
[09:12:22] <neo12> else when the modal open again, user text is visible (not placeholder)
[09:15:41] <jphase> neo12: use .attr and modify the placeholder

[11:02:40] <stan_man_can> Hey all. Having an issue. I'm using jquery to catch a form.submit() event, which strips a dash from all account number text inputs on a field and then submits the form.
[11:02:41] <stan_man_can> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/551ce1b504c28ac61d51fbc703a07960
[11:03:23] <stan_man_can> essentially the user enters accountn umbers as  000-111-222 and when you save the form we need it to be 000111222
[11:04:13] <stan_man_can> The field has a max-length of 9 though, every browser works fine except IE who, when you click submit, complains that there's  11 characters in the box, and doesn't let the jquery clean it up first

[13:51:55] <Miles8of9> i need to create a class something like MyBook = { etc etc... where do i create it? outside of $(function() {  ?
[13:54:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't have classes.
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> and you can do it within the doc ready callback.
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> well
[13:54:51] <robertmaxrees> js DOES have classes, but MyBoom = {} is just an object.  either way.
[13:55:08] <Miles8of9> ok
[14:04:34] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  If you scroll down a webpage and then reload it, should the scroll event fire on page load?
[14:04:50] <robertmaxrees> iirc no, since the user didn't initiate a scroll.
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> could have that wrong though.
[14:04:54] <dotcom> Now is better than never.
[14:05:18] <MarcGuay> robertmaxrees: Seems to do it on my dev site but not on staging, frustrating...
[14:05:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:05:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure.
[14:05:55] <MarcGuay> Something to do with the inspector being open?
[14:06:08] <MarcGuay> Probably not, it's open in both windows...
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[14:06:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[14:20:07] <amikrop> When I leave some pages, they show a confirmation dialog with custom text, and then a standard, always-the-same, translated message "Are you sure you want to leave"? (on Chrome, at least). What is that, is that something standard? Does Chrome detect that's an "exit confirmation dialog" and add the translated text?
[14:20:58] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/17143425
[14:22:38] <amikrop> robertmaxrees: yes, but the weird thing is that on all those ocassions, on completely different websites, there is a standard, translated text, that's always the same. That can't be a coincidence.
[14:23:01] <amikrop> They all have their custom text, but there's always the same translated text appended
[14:23:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ftdu4j27/
[14:23:08] <robertmaxrees> did you even try the JS?
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:23:32] <amikrop> robertmaxrees: you dont understand my question
[14:23:49] <robertmaxrees> yes, i do.
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> onbeforeunload does exactly what you're asking.
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> the same text is always used after the text you specify.
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/yFHuoAj.png
[14:25:34] <amikrop> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:56] <tocnem> I have an unordered list that I drag and drop. This means the list can be rearranged. Is there a way in JQuery or js (in general) that you can get the list of li's in the order in which they have been arranged?
[14:34:58] <dotcom> I am.
[14:35:22] <robertmaxrees> dotcom are you a bot?
[14:36:12] <robertmaxrees> tocnem depends - are you moving items in the DOM?
[14:36:29] <tocnem> robertmaxrees: how else would I be moving them? I'm using jquery ui
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> you could be absolutely positioning them.
[14:36:44] <dotcom> Namespaces are one honking great idea. Let's do more of those!
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> using jquery ui is good info.
[14:36:47] <dotcom> Error: unknown url type: jquery ui is good info.
[14:36:54] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:37:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:37:18] <tocnem> using namespace std;
[14:37:19] <dotcom> Error: unknown url type: namespace std;
[14:37:23] <tocnem> lol
[14:37:50] <robertmaxrees> "using namespace std"?
[14:38:03] <tocnem> it's a c++ thing
[14:38:12] <tocnem> irrelevant
[14:38:16] <robertmaxrees> heh okay
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> so you're using https://jqueryui.com/sortable/?
[14:38:28] <tocnem> I tried doing $("#myelement li").each()
[14:38:32] <tocnem> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:38:49] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize and http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-toArray
[14:39:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i might look at http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/ and see if any of those methods help.
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> if not, you'll have to .map() the data you want explicitly.
[14:43:44] <tocnem> robertmaxrees: do you know if there's an event or something I can hook when someone drops something from a drag and drop sortable jquery ui widget?
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to look at the docs i just sent you - they'll have everything you need to knbow.
[14:44:17] <tocnem> robertmaxrees: k
[14:44:28] <tocnem> robertmaxrees: I just looked again and it turns out i missed that section before I asked you
[14:44:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:29:18] <awkwardCough> Hey just a clarification. event.preventDefault() is used to prevent the default from happening like stopping an anchor from going to an html link and an event.stopImmediatePropagation() is more so aimed at stopping other events from running after it is called?
[15:30:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.stopimmediatepropagation/ stops subsequent handlers AND prevents bubbling.
[15:32:41] <awkwardCough> ah coolio, forgot bubbling prevention. Thxs.
[15:32:47] <robertmaxrees> def.
[15:38:45] <geri> hi, is there a better way get an integer from an input? var numSamples = parseInt($('#numSamples').val(), 10);
[16:04:47] <markh> is there anything more to seeing if jquery is loaded besides doing something like: if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') {}
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd just do if (jQuery) {}
[16:05:35] <markh> if (jQuery) or if (!jQuery) ?
[16:05:50] <robertmaxrees> either/or depending on which you need.
[16:06:00] <robertmaxrees> but you should always have the lib loaded before trying to use it.
[16:06:01] <markh> right right, thank you
[16:06:19] <markh> yeah. we do third-party stuff, and we're always last to load on a page
[16:06:28] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[16:06:34] <markh> :)
[16:06:38] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't just list jquery as a req for your service?
[16:07:27] <markh> i've brought that up in the past, but as of now, we don't use jquery at all. just javascript
[16:07:54] <robertmaxrees> then why are you checking for jquery
[16:08:47] <markh> to load it if it doesn't exist
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> but you just said you don't use it.
[16:09:24] <markh> we don't currently, but I'd like to integrate it. it would help us (the developers) tremendously
[16:09:46] <robertmaxrees> heh, then i'd list the new version of whatever it is as requiring jquery
[16:09:52] <robertmaxrees> loading it yourself is a really hairy proposition.
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> you could end up stomping all over the client's copy.
[16:10:17] <robertmaxrees> or they might use a version that's older/newer than what you need.
[16:10:50] <markh> yeah, that's what i'm afraid of. i've read a number of lengthy articles on how to check for the exact versions you need, but i don't really like any of the solutions
[16:11:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, which is why you don't try to do it.
[16:12:25] <markh> yeah. i may switch up my tactics, go through our clients, and see which have jquery already and which versions they use.
[16:12:47] <markh> if it's more than like 90%, it may be a good idea as you suggested to just require jquery
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> plenty of 3rd parties already have a minimum version they require.
[16:17:18] <markh> thanks for the input robertmaxrees
[16:17:31] <markh> headed to lunch, bbl
[16:17:35] <robertmaxrees> i used to work with a service provider, so i know those pains.
[16:19:30] <geri> hi, is there a better way get an integer from an input? var numSamples = parseInt($('#numSamples').val(), 10);
[16:19:39] <robertmaxrees> geri not really.
[17:54:05] <devslash> I dynamically create a button and adding it to a div using jquery. The resulting HTML code looks like this: <button class="clueField" id="clue0" type="text" maxlength="1">U</button>. I want to capture the click event for this button so I created a click event like this $(".clueField").on( "click", function() { alert("here"); }); but the alert never gets triggered
[17:54:14] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener.
[17:54:23] <devslash> how
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> these will both explain how :)
[17:54:55] <devslash> i have created an event for dynamicalyl created objects and it worked using the on event
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not necessarily a delegated listener.
[17:55:13] <devslash> thats what I am doing
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> no you're not.
[17:55:23] <robertmaxrees> your listewner is not delegated.
[17:55:28] <robertmaxrees> it's bout directly to the element,.
[17:55:30] <devslash> $(".clueField").on( "click", function()
[17:55:30] <robertmaxrees> *bound
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not delegated.
[17:55:40] <devslash> according to that link it is
[17:55:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:56:07] <devslash> how do i make it delegated
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> you skipped to the first example, in which the preceding paragraph tells you it's not delegated.
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/XUejifI.png
[18:26:07] <devslash> robertmaxrees, how do i apply that to a button element
[18:26:47] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function)
[18:26:55] <robertmaxrees> select an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[18:27:10] <robertmaxrees> then pass your button as the second arg.
[18:27:10] <devslash> for child ?
[18:27:17] <devslash> can i use body
[18:27:24] <robertmaxrees> avoid body if possible.
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> bind to a more relevant location.
[18:27:34] <devslash> like what
[18:27:44] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:27:51] <robertmaxrees> i know literally nothing about your markup.
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> so i'd have to see.
[18:28:04] <robertmaxrees> but i'm going to guess this is apart of some kind of widget or something.
[18:28:08] <devslash> if i cant use the element and I shouldnt use body i dunno what else
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> what are you appending the element to?
[18:28:46] <devslash> another div called cluesDiv
[18:28:54] <robertmaxrees> so then try that.
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> seems pretty relevant.
[18:30:53] <devslash> that doesnt work
[18:31:11] <robertmaxrees> do you dynamically create that element, too?
[18:31:17] <devslash> no
[18:31:24] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a doc ready?
[18:31:26] <devslash> oh wait no it is
[18:31:31] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> the go higher up.
[18:31:34] <devslash> it is created dynamically and yes
[18:31:40] <robertmaxrees> to a relevant elemenbt.
[18:31:41] <devslash> im getting a js error
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:31:50] <devslash> $('#cluesDiv').on('click', '.clueField', function() {
[18:32:10] <robertmaxrees> right, so '#cluesDiv' is dynamically created, right?
[18:32:13] <robertmaxrees> gotta go up higher.
[18:33:17] <devslash> ok I had to use body as the parent but it works now
[18:33:20] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:33:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> you should bind as low as you can get away with.
[18:33:35] <devslash> thats the parent of the element #cluesDiv
[18:33:36] <robertmaxrees> keep things contextual.
[18:33:40] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:34:27] <devslash> thanks
[19:07:35] <markh> robertmaxrees: of the 327 clients i checked, 6 didn't use jquery
[19:07:45] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's time for them to start.
[19:07:48] <robertmaxrees> also: versions of jquery.
[19:08:34] <markh> oldest version i saw was 1.4, but even if we were limited to 1.0 features, it would be very helpful
[19:08:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:08:51] <robertmaxrees> there are quirks between various versions, too.
[19:08:54] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[19:09:06] <markh> well, that'd be annoying then
[19:09:10] <markh> any examples?
[19:09:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to jump through the docs.
[19:10:30] <markh> no need then, my issue to solve :)
[19:10:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:13:04] <acidjazz> clients?
[19:14:08] <robertmaxrees> you know, people that pay you to do work?
[19:14:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:14:28] <acidjazz> could mean alot of things
[19:14:36] <acidjazz> i read it wrong
[19:15:18] <markh> yeah, we're a third-party addon
[19:16:06] <eddy> hi guys how can i unbind an on click event? i only want to unbind only if they is no other on click listener already in exisiting for that element
[19:16:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:17:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds really roundabout eddief
[19:17:12] <robertmaxrees> err, *eddy
[19:18:27] <eddy> robertmaxrees, its a one page application and i find that when i on to a page and come back out then go back to it
[19:18:38] <eddy> the only click is attached twice
[19:18:55] <robertmaxrees> you should be using a delegated listener and not re-running the binding, then.
[19:20:09] <eddy> robertmaxrees, http://kopy.io/SR8bk
[19:20:20] <eddy> that var btn
[19:20:23] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:20:29] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't be in that function.
[19:21:10] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason you use a delegated listener is so you don't have to biund afrer elements are created.
[19:21:29] <robertmaxrees> stripe.tryToPay(opts.formName, opts.itemId);
[19:22:01] <robertmaxrees> attach the formname and itemid as data attributes.
[19:22:35] <eddy> http://kopy.io/hPbfN
[19:22:46] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:22:51] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:22:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[19:23:12] <eddy> data attribute to the button?
[19:23:16] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:26:12] <eddy> delegated listener?
[19:26:22] <eddy> is that what i am using
[19:26:27] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', '#stripePay', function(){ is a delegated listener.
[19:26:30] <robertmaxrees> it binds to the body.
[19:27:40] <robertmaxrees> err, document.
[19:27:42] <robertmaxrees> not body.
[19:28:09] <eddy> so i couldnt bind to document?
[19:28:13] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[19:28:19] <robertmaxrees> that's what you're doing there.
[19:28:38] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason you use delegated listeners is so you don't have to worry about when elements get added/removed.
[19:34:06] <eddy> http://kopy.io/11mb4 robertmaxrees IS THIS RIGHT
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> now move  $(document).on('click', '#stripePay', function(){ completely out of the createbutton function.
[19:35:18] <robertmaxrees> iirc there are quirks w/r/t camelcasing data attribute names.
[19:35:22] <robertmaxrees> i always just lowercase 'em.
[19:40:05] <eddy> robertmaxrees, i moved it seem to only have 1 now
[19:40:11] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[19:40:15] <eddy> camelcasing
[19:44:10] <ekkis> greetings everyone.  I'm looking at the source for query-form and I see that it declares two anonymous functions that never get assigned to a variable or called.  does that make any sense?
[19:44:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the source of what you're looking at.
[19:44:45] <ekkis> let me put it up
[19:46:12] <ekkis> http://termbin.com/8p11
[19:46:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean
[19:46:24] <robertmaxrees> (function (factory) {
[19:46:26] <robertmaxrees>  ?
[19:46:28] <ekkis> yes
[19:46:52] <ekkis> it declares a function but doesn't name it and doesn't assign it to a variable and also doesn't call it anywhere
[19:46:56] <ekkis> so it's dead code!
[19:46:59] <ekkis> right?
[19:47:13] <ekkis> the second function too is dead
[19:47:16] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[19:48:15] <robertmaxrees> actually, wrong :)
[19:48:44] <ekkis> oh?
[19:48:46] <robertmaxrees> the first (function(factory) { is actually a wrapper for the whole fine.
[19:48:48] <robertmaxrees> *file
[19:48:53] <robertmaxrees> so it supports amd.
[19:49:31] <robertmaxrees> notice out that opening parent doesn't close until the very end?
[19:49:47] <ekkis> I don't have line numbers on it but it starts at line 14 and ends at line 23
[19:49:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:49:58] <robertmaxrees> that's the curly.
[19:50:07] <ekkis> yes, which constitutes the function definition
[19:50:18] <robertmaxrees> this is just an iife.
[19:50:21] <ekkis> the first function
[19:50:30] <ekkis> ok.  but then where is it invoked?
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> (function() {}(function() {}));
[19:50:35] <robertmaxrees> it's self invoking.
[19:50:47] <ekkis> the second function begins at line 25 and ends with the file
[19:50:51] <robertmaxrees> you've seen (function() {}()); before, right?
[19:50:59] <ekkis> ah!
[19:51:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:51:06] <robertmaxrees> just an iife yo.
[19:51:09] <ekkis> yikes.  I see it now
[19:52:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:53:10] <ekkis> ok.  now a different question... I'm trying to run this in a browserified environment so on line 21 `typeof(jQuery)` will return undefined... I would have to do a `var jQuery = require('jquery')` for it to work... any thoughts on how else this would be handled?
[19:54:32] <robertmaxrees> i don't know much about browserify but i would guess it's got some kind of way to specify deps for a package.
[19:54:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, require jquery.
[19:54:58] <ekkis> ok.  let me think about it a bit
[19:55:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you using that plugin for?
[20:02:32] <ekkis> robertmaxrees: well, ajaxifies a form
[20:02:53] <ekkis> so I guess the thing is it's designed to work with AMD but not CommonJS
[20:02:59] <ekkis> I should contribute a patch
[20:05:40] <ekkis> but now that I think of it, I can satisfy the requirement from the place where I require jquery-form too...
[20:09:32] <robertmaxrees> ekkis why use the plugin at all?
[20:09:38] <robertmaxrees> you can pretty easily do all that yourself.
[20:11:01] <ekkis> yes... but we have plugins that do things to save us work right? this thing has been tested well.  I've used it for a long time
[20:11:09] <ekkis> just not in a node.js environment
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> except it barely does anything.
[20:11:23] <robertmaxrees> you could easily "ajaxify" a form pretty quickly.
[20:11:57] <ekkis> sure, I don't disagree.  but the thing is I can't shy away from modules and just write everything myself
[20:12:36] <robertmaxrees> then create a module yourself.
[20:18:05] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not suggesting you just write everything yourself.  in this one particular case, the plugin doesn't really seem to offer much in the way of convenience over just using $.fn.on and $.ajax
[20:19:12] <ekkis> ah... ok.  yes, you're right in this very narrow sense
[20:19:39] <ekkis> but I'm struggling with the greater picture: that of being able to use jquery plugins in a node.js environment
[20:19:53] <robertmaxrees> they have to expose a module the way node requires.
[20:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you could use a shim or directly include them.
[20:20:13] <robertmaxrees> *or whatever module loader you're using.
[20:20:46] <ekkis> I need to look into that.  I haven't quite understood shims
[20:41:03] <Nikesh> Given an amount of `<article class="text" id="<unique id number">` How can I use the class selector, i.e. `$('.text')` to get the ID, i.e. `unique-id` ?
[20:41:23] <Nikesh> s/an amount of/an element/
[20:41:23] <b-ot> Correction, <Nikesh> Given an element `<article class="text" id="<unique id number">` How can I use the class selector, i.e. `$('.text')` to get the ID, i.e. `unique-id` ?
[20:41:42] <Nikesh> Wow, cool bot :D
[20:42:12] <arc_> just like css. you don't use class selector you use id selector. like #id
[20:42:45] <arc_> when you say "get" the id though, it doesn't sound like you're trying to select. it sounds like you want your expression to return the id
[20:42:52] <ekkis> Nikesh: .attr('id')
[20:43:19] <Nikesh> arc_: Yeah, I've just got the console open for a site that I want to grab some data from
[20:43:27] <arc_> ok
[20:43:39] <ekkis> as I suggested
[20:43:40] <Nikesh> i.e. I want to map over all the elements returned from `$('.text')` and get the IDs
[20:43:43] <Nikesh> ekkis: Thanks!
[20:45:50] <Nikesh> Hm.. `$('.text')[0].id` => `16724` but.. `$('.text').map(function(i) { return i.id; })` doesn't work, and neither does `... return i.attr('id');`
[20:48:46] <Nikesh> Well.. I can do it this way `for (var t = 0; t < $('.text').length; t++) { ids.push($('.text')[t].id) }`
[20:49:05] <Nikesh> (where previously `var ids = [];` )
[20:55:12] <ekkis> Nikesh: your second map statement should have worked
[20:57:50] <Nikesh> ekkis: I get a TypeError that i.attr is not a function
[21:03:12] <ekkis> the callback receives as its first parameter the object itself in the array, which should be a jquery object and thus export the .attr() method.  I don't get it
[21:25:01] <Nikesh> Hm.. not sure why!
[21:25:35] <Nikesh> Can I find elements based on what's within? E.g. finding all <h1> elements that have the word 'italian' ?
[21:25:44] <Nikesh> <h1>Italian</h1>
[21:27:39] <Nikesh> So I think I should be able to use the `.html()` method,
[21:27:45] <systemfault> Nikesh: :contains(whatever) IIRC
[21:27:57] <systemfault> But selecting nodes based off content is a bad pattern.
[21:28:08] <Nikesh> but maybe this site's jquery implementation is modified? it doesn't work
[21:28:14] <Nikesh> systemfault: OK, noted
[21:28:44] <Nikesh> $('.text')[0].html() => Uncaught TypeError: $(...)[0].html is not a function(…)
[21:29:20] <systemfault> Nikesh: Using [] unwraps the jQuery object so you're trying to call .html() on a pure DOM node.
[21:29:29] <systemfault> Replace [0] with .eq(0)
[21:33:09] <Nikesh> Cool, thanks!
