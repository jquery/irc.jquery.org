[00:00:35] <bigbang12> I am using <input type="text" id="abc@def"> when i call this id with jquery using $(#abc@def).val() . i get its value undefined can anybody help me
[00:01:18] <muley> "@" isnt a valid character for an ID
[00:01:29] <muley> "ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[00:07:25] <bigbang12> muley, but what if i need to use @ in id so is there any way to get its value
[00:09:32] <muley> it's invalid html
[00:09:37] <muley> that's not jquery
[00:10:02] <muley> you cant use @ as an ID
[00:10:35] <muley> use a hypen instead?
[00:10:38] <muley> hyphen
[00:10:55] <LostyJai> hey guys
[00:11:09] <LostyJai> just trying to use getJSON via google's geocoding API
[00:11:35] <LostyJai> $.getJSON("http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address="+escape(address)+"&sensor=false&callback=?", function(results, textStatus) { alert(data); });
[00:11:41] <LostyJai> so far i have this..... but it reutns null =/
[00:12:37] <lapistano> LostyJai, don't you need a google api key for this?
[00:12:41] <LostyJai> nope
[00:12:44] <LostyJai> it's by IP
[00:12:55] <LostyJai> they changed it
[00:13:00] <lapistano> just thinking
[00:13:04] <LostyJai> try run it in your browser, it'll return JSON
[00:15:15] <Myx0x3> how do i make an table row fade out and then "toggle" it, so it animate from 100% to 0% height?
[00:15:33] <LostyJai> toggle?
[00:15:37] <LostyJai> you want it to fade
[00:15:44] <LostyJai> and shrink at the same time?
[00:15:52] <muley> tables are a huge pain to animate
[00:16:12] <Myx0x3> yes
[00:16:14] <Myx0x3> http://pastebin.com/cH5U6cSE
[00:16:17] <Myx0x3> thats what i got now
[00:16:42] <Myx0x3> sorry for the toggle slow, hehe was just a test
[00:17:11] <Myx0x3> maybe there is no easy way to make it shrik away
[00:17:55] <Solidem> how do I find out which fieldset a user submitted a form from ?
[00:19:09] <muley> $('form').submit(function(){ var fs = $(this).closest('fieldset'); })
[00:19:25] <Solidem> oooh, thanks muley!
[00:19:31] <muley> =]
[00:19:32] <joshsmith> if I were to use a proxy to curl html server-side and output that to jQuery using ajax, how can I access the DOM?
[00:19:38] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:21:09] <Myx0x3> muley: how come its a pain in the ass to animate?
[00:21:47] <muley> tables.
[00:22:09] <muley> that's all... browsers treat them special
[00:22:27] <astropirate> joshsmith, if the output is an entire html page, then you the output of the ajax call as a "document" object and you can run your ajax queries on it like normal
[00:22:59] <Myx0x3> well, i dont care about IE, but guess FF and Webkit threat them diffrent anyways..
[00:23:25] <joshsmith> astropirate: great, thanks; going to test it out
[00:23:35] <astropirate> np
[00:27:53] <LostyJai> so...
[00:27:59] <LostyJai> can anyone help me with the JSON
[00:28:02] <LostyJai> from google map api?
[00:28:46] <LostyJai> http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=245-247%20Sunshine%20Rd,%20Tottenham&sensor=false
[00:28:53] <LostyJai> it returns teh JSON
[00:29:18] <Solidem> how can I see which specific input that triggered a post of a <form> ?
[00:29:59] <LostyJai> input being.....?
[00:30:02] <Solidem> $('form').submit(function(e) {    $(this).closest('fieldset'); });  <----- finds the closest fieldset for the form
[00:30:03] <LostyJai> textbox?
[00:30:05] <LostyJai> or button?
[00:30:12] <Solidem> it could be both
[00:30:21] <Solidem> can I find from the event what was used?
[00:30:23] <LostyJai> onsubmit?
[00:31:01] <djQuery> Solidem: u hve a formin a filedset and not teh other way around?
[00:31:38] <djQuery> e.srcElement
[00:31:58] <Solidem> djQuery, I have the form, then fieldsets inside it. Now I want to find out within which fieldset was the post made
[00:32:34] <Solidem> muley gave a good pointer to use .closest('fieldset')  but I think it's incorrect to use $(this).closest('fieldset')  considering that $(this) is the form
[00:32:51] <djQuery> Solidem: well once u have the src element you can do a closest('fieldset') on it
[00:33:24] <muley> i'm druink
[00:33:31] <djQuery> Solidem: do a console.log on e and see what props u hve avail
[00:33:31] <Solidem> :)
[00:33:52] <Solidem> srcElement is undefined
[00:34:00] <djQuery> just e then
[00:34:19] <Solidem> e.closest('fieldset') ?
[00:34:24] <djQuery>  $('form').submit(function(e) {console.log(e);})
[00:34:34] <djQuery> then look at it in console.
[00:35:11] <djQuery> believe that on a 1 field form you dont even have to have a button jsut hitting enter will trigger the post
[00:35:31] <iaj> Lo there
[00:35:33] <iaj> I got a question
[00:35:40] <iaj> Is $.tools responding to jQuery.tools ?
[00:36:10] <Solidem> djQuery, but you have to stand on a input of some sorts to be able to press enter to submit it
[00:36:14] <djQuery> $= jQuery so anythng in jQuery is the same as $.whatever
[00:36:43] <djQuery> Solidem: yes the input has to have focus for the enter to trigger the submit
[00:41:08] <Solidem> muley and djQuery, this is what you write:  $(e.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget).closest('fieldset')
[00:41:49] <djQuery> looks like a pain in the ass.
[00:42:20] <djQuery> seems it would been easier to just put a class on the active fieldset.
[00:42:31] <djQuery> Solidem: now what are u trying to achieve
[00:42:50] <muley> hopefully that is cross-browser compatible too
[00:43:09] <djQuery> $(
[00:44:53] <djQuery> $('form').find(':input').focus(function(){  $(this).closest('fieldset').addClass('activefieldset').siblings('.activefieldset').removeClass( })
[00:45:10] <djQuery> well u get the idear. and that would be cross browser
[00:45:29] <djQuery> then in the submit you can do $(this).find('.activefieldset')
[00:45:47] <djQuery> Solidem: ^^^^^^^
[00:46:40] <muley> $)
[00:47:09] <djQuery> but we still dont know why u want this info
[00:49:25] <Solidem> hehe thanks for that idea. I'm working on a project where they're using webforms, so there is only ONE form for the entire page
[00:49:48] <Solidem> then on submit I'm supposed to add some google analytics tracking and so identify which form on the page has been used
[00:50:17] <Solidem> have simulated forms by using fieldsets
[00:51:27] <LostyJai> JSON anyone?
[00:55:17] <cook1es> Hi, I'm having a problem with .html. Here is my code: $('a[class*="quickquote"]').click(function(){ $("textarea").html("Test"); }); If I click to run, and then edit the textarea, and then click to run again, it works but the textarea field is not updated. How can I do a "refresh" on the textarea?
[00:59:28] <MoTiOnXml> anyone good with regular expressions?
[00:59:35] <MoTiOnXml> i was to refer to a capturing group
[00:59:58] <MoTiOnXml> like capture a quote, then do more, then refer to the captured quote (which could be a number of things)
[01:03:39] <jordanmoore> Anybody know of any plugins that allow for full page transitions? (ie clicking on a link and sliding the previous content out of view and sliding the new content into view?)
[01:15:30] <B2011> <script>$('#id').click(function(){alert(5);});</script><p id='id'>click me</p>
[01:15:37] <B2011> where above click not working ?
[01:16:08] <B2011> if i put <p onclick="f()">click</p> it works
[01:17:02] <B2011> or should i put the script above html-head area ? i put it in body area currently
[01:18:33] <skylamer`> B2011
[01:18:48] <skylamer`> $(document).ready(function() { // });
[01:19:04] <skylamer`> in the scriptz tag :)
[01:19:26] <skylamer`> or put in in head y,ea
[01:19:58] <B2011> ah ? not understand. if i make a f(), and add a "onclick='f()'" it works anywhere in <body>
[01:21:31] <B2011> skylamer`: or this page is misleading? http://api.jquery.com/click/
[01:22:30] <aaronmcadam> B2011, there is different scoping for inline js
[01:22:34] <aaronmcadam> don't use it please
[01:23:11] <B2011> ah. ok.
[01:23:26] <B2011> so maybe i can use "onclick='...'" instead.
[01:23:30] <aaronmcadam> noooooo
[01:23:33] <aaronmcadam> i just said
[01:23:37] <aaronmcadam> don't use inline js!
[01:23:46] <aaronmcadam> bloody onclick
[01:23:55] <blackspotwiggins> B2011, if you ignore our advice, please stop asking
[01:24:07] <B2011> i m listening.
[01:24:09] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins++
[01:24:41] <blackspotwiggins> dont use inline events, understand that js is executed linearly and you need to use callbacks
[01:24:44] <blackspotwiggins> that's a start
[01:24:54] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins++
[01:25:17] <aaronmcadam> it's to stop the browser locking up basically, B2011
[01:25:41] <B2011> oops. do you mean that: it's better to include .js inside <head> area?
[01:25:49] <aaronmcadam> yes B2011
[01:26:02] <B2011> ah . ok thanks . i m js dummy as well :D
[01:26:04] <aaronmcadam> even better in an external file included in the head
[01:26:18] <B2011> ok let me test ....
[01:29:15] <B2011> aaronmcadam: man! i put the above bit js into an external .js file. still not working ?
[01:29:28] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ B2011
[01:29:28] <bot-t> B2011, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:29:59] <B2011> well. a.js only one line :$('#aabb').click(function(){alert(5);});
[01:30:12] <aaronmcadam> you didn't wrap it in a ready
[01:30:22] <B2011> and in my html file: <p id='aabb'>click me</p>
[01:30:26] <aaronmcadam> $( document ).ready( function() { .... } );
[01:30:42] <blackspotwiggins> B2011, if your script is higher up in the file than relevant bit of html
[01:30:46] <B2011> aaronmcadam: where should i type this line : $( document ).ready( function() { .... } );
[01:30:49] <blackspotwiggins> it cant bind to it, because it doesnt exist
[01:30:58] <aaronmcadam> in the external js file B2011
[01:31:02] <blackspotwiggins> that's why document ready is used
[01:31:05] <aaronmcadam> and put ur click handler inside
[01:31:24] <B2011> ah. ok . in sec ...
[01:32:00] <B2011> wow works now ! :D
[01:32:07] <aaronmcadam> k
[01:32:08] <B2011> however
[01:32:25] <B2011> doc.ready == not good idea. what if i have many many js to add ?
[01:32:34] <aaronmcadam> they stack
[01:32:42] <B2011> well. add them in one file anyway
[01:32:56] <aaronmcadam> what you're sposed to do is refactor your code
[01:33:21] <aaronmcadam> and then you could call what u want in one ready func or else they stack so u could have multiple
[01:33:59] <B2011> ah. ok.
[01:34:36] <B2011> however as i m going to follow your great idea to write everything in ONE External js. so should be ok
[01:34:59] <lanmower> lo all
[01:35:19] <B2011> but problems are: some js will run on page A; and some of them on page B; is it waste of time to put all un-used js in one global file ?
[01:35:21] <lanmower> I am using jquery delegate with the click event, and my functions get called twice...
[01:35:33] <lanmower> any idea why this may be happening or what I can check to find out?
[01:35:38] <blackspotwiggins> B2011, at some point yes
[01:35:41] <aaronmcadam> B2011, nope, tiny significance
[01:35:56] <blackspotwiggins> it's more of organizing thing
[01:35:57] <B2011> ok. i m very concerned of speed
[01:36:00] <lanmower> event.stopImmediatePropagation(); prevents this problem from happening, but I want to avoid hacking every delegate function.
[01:36:13] <blackspotwiggins> it's better to have one bigger file cached all the time
[01:36:17] <aaronmcadam> B2011, the js would be cached
[01:36:19] <blackspotwiggins> rather request a lot of small ones
[01:36:29] <B2011> aaronmcadam: ok.
[01:36:45] <lanmower> b2011 its even better if the page never reloads, and the js only loads once :)
[01:36:52] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, you're definately attaching a handler twice somewhere
[01:37:31] <B2011> lanmower: well , i tested: js, css, img, usually load twice on each page by FF
[01:37:39] <B2011> not sure if it is a FF bug or not
[01:37:49] <aaronmcadam> hah
[01:38:01] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: are you sure its definately that?
[01:38:01] <aaronmcadam> it loads from cache if it's there
[01:38:09] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, has to be
[01:38:19] <lanmower> do you want to see the file where I call my delegates?
[01:38:34] <skylamer`> Any ONE HERE like challenges f? :)
[01:38:42] <B2011> aaronmcadam: well. i set a .php as .js, and count it, each time it is called 2 times on each page
[01:39:13] <caz_> Hi there
[01:39:14] <B2011> same with an image file
[01:39:20] <lanmower> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/437592/
[01:39:51] <caz_> How can I filter elements with class with the children() method?
[01:39:59] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't need to mess with hacks lanmower
[01:40:22] <timing> caz_: add a selector
[01:40:32] <caz_> I mean, i've got this : selector.children().not(":last-child").children(), and I want to select the class (".icon)
[01:40:33] <timing> caz_: children('.foobar');
[01:40:37] <B2011> aaronmcadam: even js is cached. will it SLOW down a page, when you put too many lines of js which is un-used ?
[01:40:44] <caz_> Ok, i'll try, thank you
[01:40:53] <aaronmcadam> B2011, don't worry about it
[01:41:06] <aaronmcadam> you're using jQuery right
[01:41:15] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: if you look at that, the mediaSlider (the top one which I'm testing) fires twice when its clicked.
[01:41:19] <B2011> aaronmcadam: really r u sure? then i m going to write js, instead of html then
[01:41:21] <aaronmcadam> think about how many line you're actually using... - _ -
[01:41:35] <aaronmcadam> no don't do that
[01:41:52] <B2011> aaronmcadam: sometimes google will ignore js, so that i can dump rubbish html into js file ?
[01:42:02] <aaronmcadam> do as much as u can in html and then add js in an external file
[01:42:09] <aaronmcadam> no
[01:42:14] <aaronmcadam> don't do that
[01:42:18] <B2011> :D
[01:42:20] <aaronmcadam> do it properly
[01:42:26] <aaronmcadam> or fuck off ;)
[01:42:37] <aaronmcadam> in the nicest way possible
[01:43:08] <B2011> aaronmcadam: what i mean is to put some non-keywords text in js instead of html, so that it will rank higher in google. why not,
[01:43:10] <caz_> Thank you timing
[01:43:17] <aaronmcadam> what?
[01:43:23] <B2011> the reason i m not doing this way , is that i m worried about the speed of js
[01:43:25] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make any sense
[01:43:45] <aaronmcadam> you're asking for advice but ignoring it
[01:43:47] * gnarf pats aaronmcadam on the back
[01:43:49] <B2011> aaronmcadam: :D:D
[01:43:51] <B2011> :D
[01:43:57] <gnarf> ?vampire ?
[01:44:01] <bot-t> gnarf, Trac and mod_python = [[TracGuideToc]] Trac supports [http://www ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/wiki/TracModPython?version=1&format=txt
[01:44:05] <timing> caz_: just remember, in almost every 'Traversing' function you can put a 'Selector'
[01:44:33] <aaronmcadam> ?g semantic HTML @ B2011
[01:44:34] <bot-t> B2011, Semantic HTML - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML
[01:44:46] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: will this sort of thing manifest if the dom item got added to the dom twice?
[01:45:13] <aaronmcadam> your code was too long for me to read
[01:45:13] <lanmower> I'm adding it to a hidden div then moving them to the right parts afterwards by calling remove and append.
[01:45:30] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: yer on fire! :)
[01:45:35] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[01:45:45] <aaronmcadam> well too many people on here paste nearly their whole app
[01:45:47] <Skval> Hello all, I have a global variable stored in the begining of a JS file, i'm trying to refer this global variable inside an anonymous function passed to getJSON and it seems to be undefined inside the anonymous function.
[01:45:51] <B2011> well. better dooze off
[01:45:52] <aaronmcadam> when asking for help with a small part of it
[01:45:59] <gnarf> Skval: global variables are lame
[01:46:09] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: its ok I've just tested that code by itself and it works fine...
[01:46:09] <gnarf> Skval: see ?p
[01:46:09] <Skval> gnarf yes indeed.
[01:46:10] <bot-t> Skval, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:46:16] <lanmower> theres somehting else, gimme a min
[01:46:27] <Skval> Altough I have time constraints.
[01:46:38] <B2011> i m asleep now zzzzz
[01:47:01] <aaronmcadam> Skval, please say you've namespaced
[01:47:04] <aaronmcadam> your globqal
[01:47:12] <lanmower> yeah you were 100% right, I still had an old file that was getting loaded, it had a duplicate call to the delegate function
[01:47:14] <aaronmcadam> global*
[01:47:17] <lanmower> thanks aaroncadam :)
[01:47:20] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[01:47:26] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, no it's probably undefined = "DATA"
[01:47:30] <gnarf> Skval: so do I and trying to help you wade through an issue you can't reproduce minimally on a fiddle tells me that you have not taken the time to actually find the problem...
[01:47:47] <aaronmcadam> I meant in general tho blackspotwiggins
[01:47:59] <aaronmcadam> but haven't seen his code
[01:48:07] <gnarf> if you can't be bothered to paste, i can't be bothered to help ;)
[01:48:07] <Skval> gnarf I meant I use global variables because I have time constraints.
[01:48:13] <aaronmcadam> haha i love that Skval, time constraints, what are they
[01:48:13] <blackspotwiggins> orly?
[01:48:15] <Skval> I'll paste it right away
[01:48:22] <gnarf> wtf lame excuse
[01:48:26] <aaronmcadam> we all have more time than you :D
[01:48:34] <aaronmcadam> your time is more important, right?
[01:48:49] <caz_> I've got an other question: How can I select all the siblings exept the one on which we are currently?
[01:48:52] <gnarf> you meant you use global variables because your lazy? :)
[01:49:03] <Skval> gnarf I wanted to re-write the structure of the code. I'm working with existing code here.
[01:49:06] <Skval> My boss told me not to.
[01:49:09] <Skval> nothing I can do here.
[01:49:28] <blackspotwiggins> oh well
[01:49:29] <gnarf> oh, thats the problem, you have a boss who tells you how to implement
[01:49:37] <gnarf> ask him? :)
[01:49:40] <blackspotwiggins> bad practices = more time consumed anyway
[01:49:58] <Skval> blackspotwiggins I totally agree
[01:50:07] <Skval> And I told my empolyers that.
[01:50:22] <Skval> But, they seem to have upcoming representation to the investors few days from now.
[01:50:28] <blackspotwiggins> well, do as they say. but your productivity will be lower
[01:50:37] <blackspotwiggins> that's their responsibility for being shitty managers :D
[01:50:41] <lanmower> doesnt global variables make sense if using jquery namespaces, in an applications context (lets say you want a resident uploader or something) ?
[01:50:43] <Skval> lol
[01:51:14] <lanmower> Skval: thats the very reason you're sitting here right now trying to find a problem you cant find.
[01:51:24] <blackspotwiggins> btw Skval if it turns really bad
[01:51:29] <blackspotwiggins> submit to dailywtf
[01:51:38] <blackspotwiggins> we all need a laugh/facepalm once in a while
[01:51:50] <gnarf> ?js fail
[01:51:51] <bot-t> gnarf: <function fail() {return (![] + [])[+ []] + (![] + [])[+ !+ []] + ([![]] + [][[]])[+ !+ [] + [+ []]] + (![] + [])[!+ [] + !+ []];}>
[01:51:56] <gnarf> ?js fail()
[01:51:57] <bot-t> gnarf: "fail"
[01:52:05] <lanmower> ask for an extension to refactor and clean up the code and do it.

[01:53:16] <molavy> hi
[01:53:39] <molavy> how can use selector for this type of class
[01:53:48] <gnarf> ?js [(![] + []), +[], (![] + [])[+[]]]
[01:53:49] <bot-t> gnarf: ["false", 0, "f"]
[01:54:07] <molavy> class="change(number)"
[01:54:09] <aaronmcadam> aj
[01:54:12] <aaronmcadam> it prints fails
[01:54:14] <aaronmcadam> it prints fail
[01:54:21] <Skval> gnarf here's my code
[01:54:22] <Skval> http://pastebin.com/tRxL4P53
[01:54:31] <Skval> (I filtered some irrelevant lines
[01:54:39] <molavy> any idea?
[01:54:45] <gnarf> is that var p in a "function" ?
[01:54:56] <lanmower> Skval: I spent one day rewriting and refactoring all the js for a site (thats been in development for a year). I'm sure your 'employees' can do it in two hours cause I guarantee you you're site is about 5% of the amount of code.
[01:55:07] <MoTiOnXml> can't figure this regex out; whatever i do it only matches once - and i use the /m flag
[01:55:26] <molavy> how can use selector for this type of class:class="change(number)"
[01:55:28] <molavy> ?
[01:55:33] <lanmower> MoTionXml have you seen regexbuddy?
[01:55:37] <Skval> lanmower that's not an option.
[01:55:47] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: i'm using regex buddy :)
[01:55:49] <gnarf> and p is totaly in scope there Skval
[01:55:56] <molavy> no idea?
[01:55:59] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: but in js it's only matching the first line
[01:56:08] <gnarf> is there another var p somewhere?
[01:56:13] <Skval> nope
[01:56:25] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: do i have to iterate on the results?
[01:56:31] <gnarf> and as far as globals go,,, "p" is like the worst name you coulda ever chosen
[01:56:42] <Skval> I didn't choose the name
[01:56:45] <molavy> just small answer please
[01:56:52] <lanmower> did you try an export to javascript?
[01:56:53] <Skval> I'm working with existing code here guys.
[01:56:59] <aaronmcadam> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:05] <lanmower> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:07] <lanmower> lol
[01:57:09] <aaronmcadam> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:09] <aaronmcadam> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:10] <aaronmcadam> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:10] <aaronmcadam> Skval, namespace it
[01:57:11] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:57:13] <Skval> lol
[01:57:23] <Skval> ok guys, 'll name space it (:
[01:57:24] <lanmower> you're trying to use variables outside their context, of course they wont work.
[01:57:27] <gnarf> aaronmcadam leaves #jquery (excessive echo)
[01:57:29] <Skval> not sure what you mean, but i'll google for it
[01:57:31] <aaronmcadam> ?g namespace @ Skval
[01:57:32] <bot-t> Skval, Namespace - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace
[01:57:35] <Skval> thanks for your help, appreciate it
[01:57:42] <lanmower> do a basic java course (I'm juse javascript for dummies will cover contexts)
[01:57:43] <Skval> I know what generaly namespace is
[01:57:51] <aaronmcadam> well
[01:57:52] <Skval> but didn't know they exists in javascript
[01:57:57] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't
[01:58:00] <molavy> give me a selector that can select with all matched element with this class:class="change(number)"
[01:58:01] <aaronmcadam> you just implement it yourself
[01:58:11] <gnarf> Skval: var myApp = { p: new Predictions };
[01:58:13] <aaronmcadam> one sec i'll paste crockford's
[01:58:15] <gnarf> myApp.p()
[01:58:21] <gnarf> myApp.p.load()
[01:58:23] <lanmower> skval: while you're at it learn why the code doesnt work.
[01:58:25] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: will try export in regexbuddy
[01:58:39] <lanmower> sval: go take a most basic js course and you'll understand why the contexts dont match
[01:58:53] <molavy> no idea?
[01:59:04] <aaronmcadam> Skval, https://gist.github.com/1075573
[01:59:17] <lanmower> MoTiOnXml its just to confirm that you didnt make a typing or escaping error while porting the regex to javascript
[01:59:45] <molavy> is that hard ask?
[01:59:52] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: like i said it works for the first line; if i call the function 5 times, it removes 5 times, but not the sixth, etc.
[02:00:03] <gnarf> Skval: its not the issue you think it is: http://jsfiddle.net/ZKqku/
[02:00:30] <skylamer`> gnarf, can you tell how to select specific letters on the who le page with jQ ? :)
[02:00:55] <gnarf> skylamer`: can you ask again using more english?
[02:01:08] <gnarf> oh
[02:01:10] <gnarf> whole
[02:01:12] <gnarf> not who le
[02:01:16] <gnarf> makes more sense that way
[02:01:26] <blackspotwiggins> afaik you cant select letters
[02:01:28] <gnarf> you can't select individual characters in text
[02:01:32] <gnarf> you can select elements
[02:01:46] <molavy> gnarf:did you see my question?
[02:01:46] <aaronmcadam> you can use contains
[02:02:00] <aaronmcadam> but it sounds like that would be horribly inefficient
[02:02:05] <skylamer`> gnarf even with reg ex ?
[02:02:21] <gnarf> molavy: you should use two classes instead
[02:02:26] <skylamer`> so put the chars i want to select in some reg ex and its checking the whole content of the pagez
[02:02:36] <gnarf> class="changes" and class="changes-2"
[02:02:38] <gnarf> or whatever
[02:02:39] <aaronmcadam> ah that'd be slowwww
[02:02:45] <gnarf> class="changes changes-2"
[02:02:47] <gnarf> rather
[02:02:51] <gnarf> but
[02:02:57] <aaronmcadam> imagine parsing the whole page's content for letters that might not be there :o
[02:03:24] <aaronmcadam> skylamer`, what's ur app meant to be doing?
[02:04:33] <gnarf> skylamer`: that sounds horribly inefficient & slow to me (regex)
[02:04:35] <skylamer`> its not app lyllz
[02:04:43] <aaronmcadam> what i said :D
[02:04:52] * aaronmcadam pats gnarf on the back too
[02:05:01] <skylamer`> i want to select specific letterz in the body elementz
[02:05:04] <gnarf> it also sounds like a really silly idea
[02:05:12] <aaronmcadam> why
[02:05:20] <skylamer`> to add to them color and bg color :D)
[02:05:24] <aaronmcadam> eeesh
[02:05:28] <gnarf> and i refuse to waste my time implementing silly ideas for people who pluralize with z's?
[02:05:37] <skylamer`> kk
[02:05:43] <aaronmcadam> did u ever hear of CSS? see ?g CSS

[02:05:51] <aaronmcadam> aaaah fuck you BOTTTTT
[02:06:01] <skylamer`> aaronmcadam and how u can imagine u can do that with CSS ? :)
[02:06:11] <aaronmcadam> spans with classes probably
[02:06:13] <gnarf> skylamer`: <span class="highlight">c</span>
[02:06:13] <skylamer`> if you can do it just show and let it flow
[02:06:16] <skylamer`> no
[02:06:21] <skylamer`> i know
[02:06:24] <skylamer`> but without spans
[02:06:32] <aaronmcadam> not really possible
[02:06:32] <gnarf> skylamer`: i wouldn't do it without spans
[02:06:37] <gnarf> its not doable without spans
[02:06:39] <skylamer`> that i have to put spans in all the letters manually
[02:06:41] <skylamer`> ...
[02:06:41] <molavy> you told me i can' use this class:class="change(number)"
[02:06:47] <aaronmcadam> it's gotta be horrible non-semantic html for that
[02:06:50] <gnarf> even trying to implement it via a regex you'd have to fucking wrap the letters in spans
[02:06:57] * gnarf needs a nap
[02:06:58] <skylamer`> yes
[02:07:11] <skylamer`> but i want to select the letters and replace it through the css spans then

[02:07:51] <molavy> so how can i select all with new format
[02:08:03] <MoTiOnXml> lanmower: if using the /m switch, do i have to manually iterate the results? seems like .replace() is having trouble with that one
[02:08:05] <skylamer`> when i write some text, not to put the tags manually, but js to do it thourgh that method or some thing :)

[02:08:50] <skylamer`> i look
[02:09:02] <aaronmcadam> any sort of string parsing is slow in hs
[02:09:04] <aaronmcadam> js*
[02:09:11] <aaronmcadam> apart from native json of course
[02:09:27] <skylamer`> so there's no such thingz as 'letter parsing' ?
[02:09:40] <aaronmcadam> lettering.js is gonna be the closest u can get
[02:09:55] <skylamer`> yes im looking now
[02:09:58] <aaronmcadam> wtf's with the s.replace('z') goin on there
[02:10:21] <MoTiOnXml> awesome @ http://letteringjs.com/
[02:10:24] <MoTiOnXml> great work!
[02:10:49] <aaronmcadam> MoTiOnXml, hover over the J ;)
[02:11:53] <MoTiOnXml> right, regex people, i don't get this
[02:11:58] <skylamer`> that 'lettering js' is only for some thingz that already have classes and tags?
[02:11:59] <aaronmcadam> fucking regex
[02:12:08] <phryk> regex <3
[02:12:09] <MoTiOnXml> with /m, my matches are good, but i'm just getting a replace for the first match
[02:12:17] <PrinceES> <aaronmcadam> need to know something... onclick event wouldnt work inside my code...
[02:12:19] <skylamer`> So there'se no way with JS to do what i m looking for ?
[02:12:35] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: /m and replace don't work together
[02:12:46] <gnarf> i dunno
[02:12:47] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: right - so iterate then?
[02:12:48] <aaronmcadam> skylamer` you're gonna have to do it server side
[02:12:53] <gnarf> u mean /g ? :)
[02:13:05] <aaronmcadam> python or any other server side lang is much faster at string manip
[02:13:10] <MoTiOnXml> no, cause i'd like to use ^
[02:13:33] <gnarf> ?mdc regexp
[02:13:35] <bot-t> gnarf, RegExp - MDN Docs - Creates a regular expression object for matching text according to a pattern. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/regexp
[02:13:54] <MoTiOnXml> .. /\s*\[.+?\]\s*/g    should match [13-07@10:24:34] on each line, and remove it
[02:14:25] <skylamer`> ohhhh for what i need to manipulate strings cant just checking elements of the BODY for the letterz ?
[02:14:28] <gnarf> ?js "omg\nwtf\bbq".replace(/^(.*)$/gm, function( $1 ) { return $1.toUpperCase(); });

[02:14:59] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: u're the man - will check
[02:15:14] <gnarf> i guess it works
[02:15:50] <PrinceES> i am calling a function through onclick event <a href="#" id="clickme"><div class="showcase-caption-long">'+titleLong+'. PLAY Movie...</div></a>
[02:16:08] <gnarf> ?inline @PrinceES
[02:16:09] <bot-t> PrinceES, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[02:16:14] <skylamer`> may be with P H:)P
[02:16:24] <aaronmcadam> skylamer`, yes add your spans in on the server side

[03:01:58] <BlaDe^> it basically gets the first 5 elements in my treeview... but I want to get the first 5 root nodes so ul > li:first perhaps
[03:02:12] <BlaDe^> did I just solve my own question?
[03:02:17] <lanmower> stop writing everything in one line, and you'll be able to read your code.
[03:02:38] <BlaDe^> lanmower I did it so I could paste it without spamming
[03:02:49] <lanmower> stop pasting in irc then :)
[03:02:59] <BlaDe^> you want me to pastebin 80 characters?
[03:03:03] <blackspotwiggins> PrinceES, either bind the event in success handler or use live
[03:03:24] <lanmower> it takes someone 4 minutes of intense concentration to read those 80 characters and understand it
[03:03:51] <lanmower> because you're presenting him with a line of info he's not familiar with, he has to read it and try and understand your problem.
[03:05:04] <lanmower> name your variables, lay them out properly, and you'll probably solve problems like this long before you have to come here and ask about them.
[03:06:34] <lanmower> 99% of my own problems comes from the same thing, your brain wanting to ask for help is uaually it telling you your code is too complicated to read.
[03:06:53] <PrinceES> why doesnt click event call on my code.... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/8/
[03:07:02] <PrinceES> please help me :(
[03:07:10] <lanmower> PrinceES: reaing...

[03:07:37] <PrinceES> ok.ok
[03:07:42] <blackspotwiggins> princees
[03:07:50] <blackspotwiggins> fucking read what others are telling you.
[03:08:09] <BlaDe^> lanmower, just for you I even indented the markup hehe: http://pastie.org/private/hmcrw5tiwoogjxicquwq
[03:08:42] <lanmower> PrinceES
[03:08:43] <BlaDe^> and yeah, I think when your code is messy your brain avoids reading it :)
[03:08:49] <lanmower> you're binding too fast.
[03:08:54] <lanmower> use live or delegate
[03:09:10] <PrinceES> i tried almost all function.. show(); onclick(),  bind() and delegate(). none of them are working
[03:09:24] <blackspotwiggins> maybe the problem isnt there
[03:09:40] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you are attempting to bind to element that doesnt exist
[03:09:49] <blackspotwiggins> have you tried debugging it yourself
[03:09:52] <lanmower> PrinceES have you checked the dom after the inserts?
[03:09:57] <PrinceES> i am simple calling a sperate funtion in which i load flv video player
[03:10:03] <lanmower> made sure theres a button with the class showr?
[03:10:08] <ndee> is there a way to scroll to a certain element?
[03:10:09] <lanmower> id I mean?
[03:10:13] <BlaDe^> ndee .scrollTo
[03:10:36] <ndee> BlaDe^, without a plugin?
[03:10:45] <lanmower> PrinceES, use delegate, check the dom tree to make sure the element is in there.
[03:10:47] <PrinceES> you can check the dom here as well http://samirayousefi.com/slider/index.html
[03:11:02] <BlaDe^> yeah just bind to a mousemove event or similar and scrollto it, ndee
[03:11:33] <PrinceES> <lanmower> there is a button inside the line... $('#showcase').append('.......
[03:11:33] <lanmower> I dont see showr in there
[03:11:45] <lanmower> PrinceES check the DOM
[03:11:50] <lanmower> not the CODE
[03:12:08] <PrinceES> ok...
[03:12:22] <BlaDe^> lanmower did you see my pastie? :)
[03:13:14] <lanmower> blade...
[03:13:32] <BlaDe^> hello
[03:13:40] <lanmower> I'm reading it now...
[03:13:52] <BlaDe^> 4minutes? ;)
[03:13:57] <lanmower> if you want the root node.
[03:14:02] <lanmower> as a list
[03:14:07] <lanmower> then > will work
[03:14:46] <lanmower> but what exactly are you doing?
[03:15:13] <lanmower> because you're calling get on its id, turning the item into iself... I dont get that
[03:15:26] <PrinceES> yes.. i cant see $("#showr") on my DOM
[03:15:40] <BlaDe^> lanmower to build a nice array of id's
[03:16:03] <PrinceES> but why doesnt it work :(
[03:16:15] <PrinceES> <lanmower>  can you please tell me
[03:16:41] <lanmower> you want an array of id's for what purpose?
[03:16:46] <BlaDe^> for the initially open nodes
[03:16:53] <lanmower> logging?
[03:17:05] <BlaDe^> no - jstree takes an initially_open argument, these are the nodes i want open
[03:17:12] <lanmower> oh I see
[03:17:24] <lanmower> does it take id strings?
[03:18:02] <PrinceES> i am using simply code <button id="showr">PLAY Movie...</button>   ...$("#showr").click(function() { alert('hello');}
[03:18:07] <BlaDe^> lanmower yeah
[03:18:10] <BlaDe^> lanmower: #,#folder_0,#folder_736834,#folder_736847,#folder_736848
[03:18:15] <BlaDe^> why am I getting a blank # ?
[03:18:35] <BlaDe^> i guess .id is null - is there a selector for that?
[03:18:35] <PrinceES> why doesnt it load on DOM?
[03:20:48] <lanmower> check it out
[03:21:03] <PrinceES> lanmower, can you please just tell me what am i doing wrong ... why doesnt this id load inside DOM
[03:21:46] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/11/
[03:22:11] <PrinceES> this link wouldnt work....
[03:22:24] <lanmower> PrinceES alert out your insertion text and check if its correctly outputting.
[03:22:28] <PrinceES> Error 404
[03:22:28] <PrinceES> We're truly sorry, but there is no such page.
[03:22:36] <PrinceES> it says these message
[03:22:44] <lanmower> blade your code seems to work for me
[03:22:46] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/10/
[03:23:10] <lanmower> PrinceES
[03:23:14] <lanmower> I told you what to do
[03:23:15] <PrinceES> yes... :(
[03:23:30] <lanmower> print out your insertion html and ensure its correct, you have markup problems.
[03:23:42] <lanmower> once your string has the correct html
[03:23:50] <lanmower> use delegate with the click event
[03:23:57] <lanmower> if you dont have that element in the dom, it wont run
[03:24:24] <PrinceES> ok.. I am going to use delegate method instead of click
[03:24:48] <lanmower> yes you wouldn't be able to bind click like that without queueing, and even with it it would be a bad idea.
[03:24:58] <lanmower> but you need to fix your dom insertion first.
[03:25:10] <BlaDe^> lanmower how can I filter out the elements with no id, in my selector?
[03:25:21] <mightym> hey guys, im new to js/jquery and wonder what im doing wrong here: id like to remove the control bar of the video here: http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Player_Fallback.html with .remove() but it doesnt habe any effect . i tried it on document ready
[03:25:30] <lanmower> did you see the output, blade?
[03:26:20] <BlaDe^> lanmower I can see it on the live site - but that's before the jstree is rendered so markup is slightly different
[03:27:04] <lanmower> so your example has the wrong markup?
[03:27:08] <lanmower> then I cant help you.
[03:27:18] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/10/ works
[03:28:06] <lanmower> if you want to exclude the ones without id's a simple way it to not give them the folder class...
[03:29:05] <BlaDe^> ah... im not looking for .folder that's why
[03:29:26] <lanmower> only mark the ones you want in the list with .folder
[03:29:32] <BlaDe^> im using $("#folderWrapper ul > li > a") now
[03:29:43] <BlaDe^> I guess I want a:is(.folder) ?
[03:29:57] <lanmower> what you want is just ".folder" actually
[03:30:04] <BlaDe^> hm yeah - oops.
[03:30:12] <BlaDe^> Anyway, the initial problem remains I just ahve a different selector and some indented code
[03:30:30] <lanmower> I see no problem in http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/10/
[03:30:41] <lanmower> is there something you want to exclude from the output in there?
[03:30:41] <BlaDe^> at the moment it selects the first 5 nodes... I want the first 5 root nodes (so I guess li:first),   however, if there isn't 5 root nodes I want a combination of the two
[03:30:51] <lanmower> oh
[03:31:18] <lanmower> give their root nodes the class and id then.
[03:31:29] <lanmower> .folder and #folder-
[03:32:30] <lanmower> if you select the root nodes, you would get blanks, because they have no id.
[03:32:38] <lanmower> you need to give them the class and id.
[03:32:44] <BlaDe^> yeah but I don't want to give them the id because the anchor needs the id
[03:32:52] <gym_jane> hi all
[03:32:54] <lanmower> then use a different id.
[03:32:56] <lanmower> and class.
[03:33:04] <lanmower> to count your items.
[03:33:06] <gym_jane> got a problem with opacity and google fonts
[03:33:28] <gym_jane> during fading in/out my text has a black outline in ie browsers
[03:33:40] <gym_jane> is there any way of fixing this bug?
[03:33:57] <lanmower> gym_jane, I dont think you'll have any luck there. IE is very buggy with opacity.
[03:34:00] <PrinceES> lanmower, have a look at on -- http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/13/
[03:34:28] <gym_jane> :(
[03:34:51] <BlaDe^> lanmower: #folderWrapper ul > li > .folder  -- works
[03:34:51] <lanmower> gym_jane, encourage your users to use a real browser, and dont fade your text in ie.
[03:34:59] <BlaDe^> why doesn't: #folderWrapper ul > li:first > .folder      ?
[03:35:07] <lanmower> BlaDe^ yes but its a hack.
[03:35:26] <lanmower> you're counting root elements, mark your root elements for counting.
[03:35:38] <lanmower> or count #folderWrapper > ul
[03:35:39] <BlaDe^> should I do ul li:first).find('.folder') instead ?
[03:35:48] <PrinceES> lanmower, i used here ... delegate method.... but still wouldnt load
[03:35:49] <mightym> no one a hint? well thy anyway!
[03:36:22] <lanmower> PrinceES you didnt provide a testable example.
[03:36:37] <lanmower> I told you
[03:36:52] <lanmower> delegate alone wont fix your problem because there IS NO #showr
[03:36:56] <lanmower> fix your insert
[03:37:10] <PrinceES> ok
[03:37:33] <lanmower> I cant test your pasted example because its just code, theres nothing in the result
[03:37:57] <lanmower> but I searched your dom on the live site and it had no such element.
[03:38:15] <lanmower> BlaDe^ consider my thoughts
[03:38:16] <lanmower> what are you counting
[03:38:22] <lanmower> you're counting the root nodes
[03:38:53] <BlaDe^> lanmower: http://jsfiddle.net/rMnFM/
[03:38:59] <BlaDe^> the html before the jstree, easier to read
[03:39:07] <PrinceES> here i made some correction http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/15/ but... still wouldnt load
[03:39:19] <PrinceES> you can see on it http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[03:39:31] <lanmower> mark them with a class and id, or find them by selecting #folderWrapper > ul.
[03:39:32] <lanmower> then find the id's from there by running find('.folder') on the element list you've selected.
[03:40:26] <lanmower> PrinceES you still dont have a showr element.
[03:40:41] <lanmower> and missing ) after argument list			         alert("clicked!"); slider (line 40)Image corrupt or truncated: <unknown>
[03:41:23] <lanmower> PrinceES get firebug and test your code, you're flying blind  trying to notepad out your problems, you dont even know where they are
[03:46:00] <aaronmcadam> go to script tab and set some watches
[03:46:09] <aaronmcadam> and set breakpoints on your code
[03:46:12] <aaronmcadam> it's awesome
[03:46:12] <lanmower> blade, I'm making you an example...
[03:46:20] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: yeah exactly :)
[03:46:33] <aaronmcadam> really handy
[03:46:51] <aaronmcadam> cuz you can just get contextual variables and mess around

[03:59:40] <lanmower> thats an already squished version of what you're trying to do, and its 8 lines.

[04:10:50] <lanmower> there is still no #showr element. it wont work
[04:12:30] <lanmower> you CANT delegate onto something THAT ISNT THERE

[04:12:52] <lanmower> no you dont
[04:13:01] <lanmower> because ithere is no button showr

[04:14:53] <PrinceES> I am really sorry .. if i am bothering you guys
[04:14:58] <PrinceES> but... i am totally confused
[04:15:00] <PrinceES> :(
[04:15:23] <lanmower> princees
[04:15:26] <lanmower> you're not inserting that button anywhere
[04:15:32] <lanmower> use firebug, check your site
[04:15:38] <lanmower> theres no button #showr
[04:16:05] <lanmower> stop blaming jqueries delegate functions for your insertion mistakes, make sure the item is there, then bind to it and use it.
[04:16:45] <lanmower> just because you're calling append doesnt mean it works, test it, check the dom, make sure you have what you're looking for, then delegate things onto it and test.
[04:17:11] <lanmower> DEDOESSR071: thats not a jquery problem.
[04:17:22] <lanmower> contact the plugin developer, or fix your css.
[04:17:23] <banjara> question about the 'change' event : The change event is bound to a text input. The event is not getting triggered when i change the value of the text input via jQuery.val() . Is this the normal behavior?
[04:17:50] <lanmower> banjara: do you think its normal?
[04:17:57] <norbi> hi guys, from yesterday i¬¥m still trying to submit a form with the submit button, but before submitting to appear a jquery ui modal confirmation box
[04:18:13] <norbi> it works, appears and its fine, but just one thing missing
[04:18:31] <norbi> the submit button after submiting doesnt exists as variable
[04:18:43] <PrinceES> i think whatever am i doing is totally impossible :(
[04:18:53] <banjara> Ianmower: intuitively it shouldnt be the normal behavior
[04:18:57] <dardy> Hello! Anybody knows how to stop/play a html embed player with a click action???
[04:18:57] <lanmower> PrinceES no its not you made mistakes in your code
[04:18:58] <DEDOESSR071> lanmower: how would you fix that css? http://pastebin.com/Yz4YgPF2
[04:19:01] <lanmower> go fix your insertions.
[04:19:17] <lanmower> DEDOESR071, I'm not your css teacher, figure it out
[04:19:38] <sandbags> i'm using jQuery 1.6.1 and I'm getting $.tmpl [undefined] is not a function
[04:19:52] <rhino> I am trying to alert a variable and when I alert it, I get the following:  [object HTMLDivElement],  instead of the actual value
[04:19:56] <sandbags> api.jquery.com uses is but also says (although it was added in 1.4.3) isa beta feature
[04:20:02] <lanmower> sandbags it seems you're missing the template plugin?
[04:20:03] <norbi> DEDOESSR071: lol. you paste in a big css and you aspect that others to rewrite it for you
[04:20:21] <sandbags> lanmower: ack... i didn't read the page properly, didn't realise i was looking at a plugin rather than a core part of jQ
[04:20:26] <sandbags> thanks for that
[04:20:29] <norbi> rhino: you are alerting an object
[04:20:36] <norbi> not a variable value
[04:20:54] <skylamer`> DEDOESSR071 SO YOU'RE GOINHG TO SELL THINGS, when dont know how to fix problems? :)
[04:20:55] <DEDOESSR071> lanmower: norbi, no, just want some hints, not so familiar with where the error comes from
[04:20:56] <lanmower> norbi: please take over for me :)
[04:21:09] <lanmower> DODOESSR071: google a list apart
[04:21:19] <sandbags> well since i have something else to add, may i ask if anyone has any counter recommendations for jQuery compatible template markup generators?
[04:21:23] <norbi> lanmower: :)
[04:21:31] <rhino> any ideas?  by the way, here is the code:  is it possible to alert an object or at least convert the object to a variable or string?
[04:21:39] <sandbags> jquery.tmpl was recommended to me but it's not a field i've done much in
[04:22:09] <rhino> norbi:  is it possible to alert an object or at least convert the object to a variable or string?
[04:22:13] <lanmower> sandbags: html and css makes for a pretty templating engine ;)
[04:22:27] <lanmower> sandbags: and js is jquery compatible ;)
[04:22:30] <sandbags> lanmower: i don't follow your point
[04:22:36] <norbi> DEDOESSR071: what is the problem, where is the section of it in that css, explain the maybe you will get help
[04:23:28] <lanmower> what I'm saying is you're taking html (which is an easy way to display things on the screen) and css (which is an easy way to style them) and jquery (which is an easy way to program) and asking how can I style, display and program. Theres no need for further abstraction.
[04:23:38] <norbi> rhino: pastebin your code
[04:24:01] <sandbags> lanmower: but the devil is in the details
[04:24:11] <DEDOESSR071> ok, thank you all!
[04:24:13] <norbi> lanmower: do you have any sugestions for my problem? or time ?:)
[04:24:33] <sandbags> i could write the whole thing in unadorned JS but something like jquery.tmpl is a useful abstraction, nevertheless thanks for the opinion
[04:24:39] <norbi> DEDOESSR071: dont be mind, just learn to express yourself and how to ask for help
[04:24:42] <dardy> Hello! Anybody knows how to stop/play a html embed player with a click action???
[04:24:44] <lanmower> I've heard of jquery.tmpl being used, I personally delegate and livequery to make a sort of 'html templating language' out of my html markup, and exclude js completely from non .js files.
[04:24:45] <KingDosser> Hey, I am trying to select an anchor that has two properties. So a[type='blah] and a[href='blah']. Is it possible to do a[type='blah'][href='blah'] ?
[04:24:51] <norbi> pasting a big css file is not enough to us to help you
[04:25:05] <DEDOESSR071> norbi: i got it :)
[04:25:59] <lanmower> sorry norbi what was your problem?
[04:26:42] <lanmower> you submit the form then the button dissapears?
[04:27:03] <norbi> my problem is that, im having a html form, that is submitted by 3 submit buttons, cancel, go back and finalize for example
[04:27:23] <lanmower> why is cancel a form submission?
[04:27:24] <norbi> before finalize ive put a modal confirmation dialog from jqueryui
[04:27:26] <ndee> when I start to code a webapp, what is the way to organize the jquery code so that not everything is one file in the dom-ready function. What kind of approaches are there?
[04:27:35] <rhino> norbi:  here is the pastie of the code along with a brief explanation:  http://pastie.org/2206668
[04:27:39] <norbi> lanmover: because php is behind and it works with sessions
[04:27:55] <lanmower> norbi: php understand get as well as post
[04:27:56] <norbi> it has its own functionality behing
[04:28:12] <norbi> behind*
[04:28:23] <norbi> ive just gave you an example with cancel
[04:28:54] <lanmower> ok so you have 3 buttons and for some bod unknown reason they're all form submissions for the same form, you submit it and you're preventing the default action on submit on it right? to display a dialog instead.
[04:29:07] <norbi> after putting the confirmation dialog on the finalize and on pressing the confirm button, the form submits via$ (#form).submit()
[04:29:14] <lanmower> whats the problem? cant you find the submit button then from the dialogues code when you accept it?
[04:29:21] <norbi> yes
[04:29:39] <norbi> no, the problem is
[04:29:55] <norbi> after submitting the form, i cant find the value of the submit button
[04:30:09] <lanmower> what do you mean you cant
[04:30:12] <lanmower> why not
[04:30:43] <norbi> because the submit button wasnt pressed and posted
[04:31:14] <norbi> it was prevented by default, apeared the confirmation dialog and submitted via javascript
[04:31:28] <norbi> maybe im missing something
[04:31:29] <lanmower> how about not preventing it but waiting for the dialog?
[04:31:47] <norbi> hmm, how can i do that?
[04:32:22] <lanmower> have you tried to check http://www.google.co.za/search?q=jquery+form+confirmation+dialog
[04:32:33] <norbi> $(.thirdsubmit).click(function(){  ...  dialog open, wait, if confirm, ... submit});
[04:33:21] <lanmower> how about changing the buttons to check boxes and having one submit?
[04:33:40] <lanmower> or how about adding a hidden value into the form with the js in the confirm dialog?
[04:33:54] <lanmower> before submitting.
[04:34:04] <norbi> the hidden input added with js maybe a good solution
[04:34:04] <lanmower> have you considered any of the options?
[04:34:17] <lanmower> also, think about it
[04:34:18] <norbi> yes, ive thought about adding a hidden input
[04:34:35] <norbi> it looks like that is the best solution
[04:34:45] <lanmower> think about it this way
[04:35:27] <norbi> so when it confirms, add a hidden input, after that submit
[04:35:27] <lanmower> when you've prevented the default, you're already on your way, how about then just triggering the button from the dialog instead of submitting the form?
[04:35:53] <lanmower> theres at least 60 different ways to get around this limitation (html is very flexible)
[04:36:28] <lanmower> how about submitting the form FROM the confirmation dialogue as ajax? (the right way to do it nowadays)
[04:36:29] <norbi> that is a better solution, how can i trigger it? on confirm: $(¬®.thirdbutton¬®).
[04:36:51] <lanmower> just google around a bit, you'll find ways around the issue.
[04:37:05] <norbi> lanmower, no ajax is not an option here, i cant get in the php code now, i need just to add a confirmation box, simple html
[04:37:17] <PrinceES> <lanmower> i have checked everything on the dom... through firbug
[04:37:29] <lanmower> norbi, you can even ajax with php code that doesnt support ajax.
[04:37:30] <PrinceES> but... onclick event is not calling :(
[04:37:43] <norbi> thanks for the solutions!
[04:37:45] <lanmower> you just post something at the php and use the response in a certain way
[04:37:46] <norbi> and ideas!
[04:37:58] <norbi> :)
[04:37:58] <PrinceES> there are sooooo many object details...
[04:38:02] <lanmower> you can even search the response and grab one div and its contents out of it and use it
[04:38:14] <lanmower> Norbi: I have faith in your skills. I really dont think you need someone to hold your hand.
[04:38:37] <lanmower> PriceES it has a search
[04:38:47] <ndee> what is considered best practice when it comes to a webapp architecture?
[04:38:51] <norbi> yes, i know, but im really tired now, and despeate because of some things, and i have loss of insipration :)
[04:39:09] <norbi> thank you very much for your help, really appreciate!
[04:41:02] <PrinceES> this button Id #showr wouldnt loading on DOM
[04:42:09] <Yanch0> guys - this is a simple question but the more im looking at google the more im getting confused: i have 2 divs inside another div and would like that when the user clicks in div#1 it fades out and div#2 fades in instead. same goes for #2 and #1. obviously when the user clicks on an <a href> in div#1 i do not want the fade to occur
[04:42:23] <PrinceES> you are expert on it... may you please let me know why doesnt it load on DOM ...
[04:42:37] <PrinceES> because i have tried since yesterday all function and method...
[04:42:43] <PrinceES> but it is still not working
[04:43:02] <PrinceES> mayebe your little help can solve my problem
[04:44:30] <Paveloosha> @<Yanch0>, no way..
[04:44:57] <Yanch0> Paveloosha, it cant be done ?
[04:45:41] <Paveloosha> <Yanch0>, it can be done but may be script may complicated..
[04:45:55] <Paveloosha> sorry about my English
[04:45:58] <Paveloosha> :)
[04:46:11] <lanmower> PrinceEs: either you're inserting incorrect html into the dom, or you're inserting it into something that doesnt exist.
[04:46:38] <Paveloosha> @<Yanch0>, I can show you a way but pyou need to try that..
[04:47:05] <Paveloosha> bcz i didnt tried that
[04:49:01] <Yanch0> Paveloosha, well im thinking hooking an onclick on both divs
[04:49:08] <juha___> i'm mean, i added a line of code to one our internal tools, that will change the font to comic sans every thursday :D
[04:49:18] <Yanch0> and one the div#1 i check if it was raised from an a element
[04:49:48] <Paveloosha> you cant make it work if you need same event to be fired
[04:50:31] <Paveloosha> There may be a way I am thinking is you need to add a condition.
[04:51:31] <Paveloosha> if you reply me fast, I can suggest you..
[04:54:15] <Paveloosha> put onClick event of divs within a condition.. like if(clickEneble){"do fade"}
[04:55:31] <Paveloosha> <Yanch0>, and make "clickEneble=false" when you are hovering on <a> tag ..
[04:56:13] <Yanch0> so just put another attribute?
[04:58:11] <sodapop> how can i uncheck a radio if using buttonset()
[04:58:42] <Paveloosha> <Yanch0>, not attribute.. you can use a vaoriable
[04:58:58] <Paveloosha> *variable
[05:00:16] <juha___> bird is the word.
[05:00:31] <lanmower> babababirdbird bird.
[05:00:41] <Yanch0> ok Paveloosha - i was thinking maybe check the id if its of the a href id ?
[05:00:56] <DoubleBinary> Hey. I got a question on JSON. Does anyone have a very simple working example of a client and server side php.script?
[05:01:41] <Paveloosha> you can try for it, only it needs a condition..
[05:02:14] <Paveloosha> main thing is you cant make work same event out side and inside
[05:02:23] <PrinceES> Paveloosha...
[05:02:28] <Paveloosha> yes
[05:02:52] <Paveloosha> <PrinceES>?
[05:03:08] <snarf1974> Hi, I hope someone can help me with this problem. I've got an email newsletter which links to a specific H3 in the jquery UI accordion, however there is a tracking code query string in the link (?ebul=eexp/11-jul-11&cr=6) which means that the page will load okay in the browser, but the specific H3 does not open. Is there anything I can do to rectify this?
[05:03:29] <PrinceES> unable to load video...
[05:03:44] <PrinceES> actually, calling a method... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/18/
[05:04:15] <PrinceES> there is a button .... <button id="showVideo">PLAY Movie...</button> middle of the code
[05:04:31] <Paveloosha> okay.. then?
[05:04:37] <PrinceES> and down .... $("#showVideo").click(function () {   alert('clicked');  });
[05:04:53] <PrinceES> but it wouldnt call to this alert(); method
[05:05:00] <PrinceES> i also tried with this way...
[05:05:14] <PrinceES> http://samirayousefi.com/slider/index.html
[05:05:22] <PrinceES> there are some video...
[05:05:33] <PrinceES> and i want to load them on it...

[05:06:27] <PrinceES> there is a button...
[05:06:32] <PrinceES> play movie...
[05:06:37] <PrinceES> and it wouldnt played
[05:06:51] <PhanLord> is there a way to control Dialog buttons (disable enable certain buttons ? )
[05:07:20] <Yanch0> Paveloosha, on this its not working : if ($(this).id !== '#emailLink')
[05:07:29] <Paveloosha> wait
[05:08:02] <Yanch0> http://pastebin.com/DeKxNFUu
[05:09:46] <PrinceES> Paveloosha.. i have been trying since yesterday.... but still wouldnt load the video on it :(
[05:09:47] <sodapop> when using .attr("checked", "checked") on a radio.buttonset() works but the style of the button is not changed, any idea?
[05:10:30] <snarf1974> Anyone out there got any experience with jquery UI accordion?
[05:10:31] <PrinceES> please help me... i followed the way that you suggested me on yesterday
[05:10:54] <PrinceES> calling a spearate function... and pass the value on it...
[05:11:31] <PrinceES> but the problem is that whenever i add something inside this appened(..... ).. it wouldnt recongized
[05:13:35] <Yanch0> Paveloosha, changed this.id to emailLink rather than #emailLink .. but firebug still shows that this is the div not the a href
[05:13:36] <sodapop> fixed it needed .button('refresh');
[05:19:15] <KingDosser> Can anyone please tell me why this isn't working? $(selector).css('display','block').delay(2000).css('display','none');
[05:19:36] <KingDosser> It does the first half but doesn't delay then do the display none,
[05:19:58] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ KingDosser
[05:19:58] <bot-t> KingDosser, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:20:09] <aaronmcadam> delay might not return jQuery
[05:20:16] <aaronmcadam> you might need .end()
[05:20:25] <aaronmcadam> ?end @ KingDosser
[05:20:26] <bot-t> KingDosser, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[05:20:28] <aaronmcadam> ?delay
[05:20:29] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[05:21:09] <aaronmcadam> ah it does, it should be chainable then
[05:21:41] <KingDosser> So aaronmcadam: Delay then end or vice versa?
[05:22:19] <aaronmcadam> delay then end dude
[05:22:46] <snarf1974> Can anyone help me with a jquery UI accordion issue?
[05:23:24] <Paveloosha> <Yanch0>, show your code please
[05:23:56] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, Please wait , I will be back
[05:24:07] <Yanch0> Paveloosha, http://pastebin.com/vCsxXpuK
[05:26:15] <Yanch0> http://pastebin.com/xpVBnxmq Paveloosha  better - coz i added the a element too
[05:27:05] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam: $(selector).css('display','block').delay(2000).end().css('display','none');  Still not working :(
[05:27:19] <erichynds> you can't use delay like that
[05:27:24] <erichynds> and end() there doesn't do anything
[05:27:31] <erichynds> delay works in between animation queues
[05:27:32] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ KingDosser
[05:27:33] <bot-t> KingDosser, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:27:41] <KingDosser> erichynds How would I better do it?
[05:27:48] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam... Its one line.
[05:27:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah I just realised that erichynds haha :D
[05:28:04] <erichynds> $(selector).show(0).delay(2000).hide(0);
[05:28:07] <aaronmcadam> I wanted to see the html too
[05:28:34] <erichynds> passing in 0 will use the animate cue rather than just change the property immediately
[05:28:38] <KingDosser> its <div><p>foo</p></div> I am selecting the div
[05:28:39] <erichynds> queue
[05:28:43] <aaronmcadam> ahh handy
[05:30:25] <aaronmcadam> KingDosser, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/TDTyp/
[05:32:24] <aaronmcadam> ?show
[05:32:24] <bot-t> .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[05:32:47] <snarf1974> Anybody help with jquery UI accordion problem?
[05:34:02] <aaronmcadam> so how would u set duration in this instance erichynds
[05:34:21] <erichynds> replace the 0 with a higher number
[05:34:25] <erichynds> in show/hide
[05:34:33] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam: That doesn't even work?
[05:34:43] <aaronmcadam> yes it does king

[05:35:46] <bot-t> KingDosser, (‚ïØ‚Äµ–î‚Ä≤)‚ïØÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
[05:35:55] <KingDosser> Lol
[05:36:01] <iksik> is it possible to limit number of results when looking for $('div') and i want only 3 first div elements
[05:36:02] <iksik> ?
[05:36:06] <aaronmcadam> throwing a table at  u dude :P
[05:36:38] <aaronmcadam> ?eq
[05:36:38] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:36:39] <Paveloosha> Please wait
[05:36:42] <snarf1974> Can anyone even respond to me!!!!
[05:36:43] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:36:57] <aaronmcadam> hey that's not the way to get help
[05:37:19] <aaronmcadam> ?filter
[05:37:19] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[05:37:26] <aaronmcadam> iksik?
[05:37:48] <aaronmcadam> in the func you could say "return index <= 2"
[05:37:56] <snarf1974> What is the way to get help?
[05:38:07] <aaronmcadam> not to whinge like a little girl :P
[05:38:22] <snarf1974> Good point well made
[05:38:34] <aaronmcadam> one sec iksik lemme try on fiddle
[05:38:54] <iksik> hum
[05:38:58] <rhino> has anyone ever worked much with jquery-file-upload.js?
[05:39:08] <iksik> aaronmcadam, ok
[05:39:42] <aaronmcadam> iksik i'll be with u in  a minnnn
[05:40:39] <blackspotwiggins> iksik, :lt(3)
[05:40:53] <aaronmcadam> aye
[05:41:20] <iksik> nice, works good ;]
[05:41:22] <iksik> thank You
[05:41:27] <aaronmcadam> iksik here's my example http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:41:36] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/DCVaF/ iksik
[05:41:43] <aaronmcadam> but yeah lt will work fine :)
[05:42:23] <KingDosser> Omg I keep getting TypeErr: blah is null
[05:42:35] <aaronmcadam> you could probably build on my fiddle iksik if u wanted to do something more involved
[05:43:50] <aaronmcadam> i never use filter, dunno why
[05:44:00] <aaronmcadam> learned a wee bit by guessing how it worked
[05:44:29] <aaronmcadam> difference between filter/map? map works only works on arrays?
[05:44:51] <aaronmcadam> or a wrapped set
[05:45:34] <blackspotwiggins> filter usually reduces the amount of members in array
[05:45:41] <blackspotwiggins> map converts them to something else
[05:45:44] <aaronmcadam> ah yes!
[05:45:47] <aaronmcadam> good man
[05:46:18] <aaronmcadam> seems there's no jQuery.filter
[05:46:31] <aaronmcadam> so you can't pass an arbitary array?
[05:47:26] <AlexKourou> Hello,could som1 explain how can i get a clicked urls parameters and alert it?Thanks!
[05:48:27] <aaronmcadam> parameters?
[05:48:31] <aaronmcadam> do u mean get vars?
[05:48:42] <aaronmcadam> i.e. ?this=1&that=2?
[05:49:49] <PrinceES> <aaronmcadam> can you please let me know why doesnt the button load the function on ... http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[05:50:04] <PrinceES> please go to the 4 thumbnail...
[05:50:20] <PrinceES> and there is a video and holding a button on it...
[05:50:36] <AlexKourou> Yes vars,my mistake.
[05:50:59] <rhino> I am trying to get the uploaded files to appear in a separate div within the form.  Currently, based on the change I made to the getJSON function on the index page, on page load, the proper items are showing up in the proper div, but after a file is just uploaded and jquery is being used to remove the downloaded file from one div and add it to the other, I recieve the following error msg.  Error: emptyResult.  It is coded to throw that
[05:51:05] <rhino> msg if there is no data, but I just can't figure out why it is getting no data.
[05:51:05] <rhino> here is a gist of my files:  https://gist.github.com/1080235
[05:51:46] <rhino> by the way, I'm working with jquery.fileupload.js
[05:51:55] <PrinceES> here is the code... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/20/
[05:53:19] <PrinceES> there is a button middle of the append(........ <button id="showVideo">PLAY Movie...</button>..... ); method  $("#showVideo").click(function () {    alert('clicked');  });
[05:53:36] <PrinceES> it doesnt work.... :( http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/20/
[05:53:39] <PrinceES> please help me
[05:54:09] <PrinceES> please let me know if there is some that i need to make a changes
[05:54:17] <PrinceES> i did almost all the way...
[05:54:29] <PrinceES> but couldnt find what is the problem inside my set of code
[05:55:03] <aaronmcadam> PrinceES sorry I don't have the time or the inclination to look at all your code
[05:55:23] <PrinceES> it is not very lengthy code
[05:55:35] <PrinceES> just a little code ..
[05:56:00] <PrinceES> i am also ready to pay if someone will just help me
[05:56:14] <PrinceES> because i have been trying to fix this problem since yesterday on...
[05:56:15] <aaronmcadam> normally don't accept donations here
[05:56:32] <PrinceES> and still cannot able to fixed it
[05:56:42] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with it
[05:57:05] <PrinceES> i have a created a button...
[05:57:08] <aaronmcadam> also don't reference a function before you define it
[05:57:18] <PrinceES> and this button has an click event
[05:57:31] <PrinceES> and i am calling this click event
[05:57:34] <PrinceES> but it wouldnt work...
[05:57:37] <aaronmcadam> you're triggering an ajax call right on document ready?
[05:57:40] <PrinceES> there is a button middle of the append(........ <button id="showVideo">PLAY Movie...</button>..... ); method  $("#showVideo").click(function () {    alert('clicked');  });
[05:57:48] <PrinceES> yes...
[05:58:16] <aaronmcadam> and a custom xml parsing func
[05:58:37] <aaronmcadam> move the func def above the ajax call for a start
[05:58:59] <PrinceES> ok
[05:59:17] <aaronmcadam> also be careful your other code isn't depending on something being set in your parseXML func
[05:59:28] <aaronmcadam> that awShowCase call
[06:00:05] <aaronmcadam> where does #showVideo get created
[06:00:19] <PrinceES> not in css
[06:00:30] <PrinceES> it is just for seeing that it works or not ..
[06:00:31] <aaronmcadam> haha i'd hope not
[06:00:48] <PrinceES> because i will pass a param on it...
[06:00:50] <aaronmcadam> does it already exist on the page
[06:00:50] <PrinceES> later...
[06:00:56] <PrinceES> yes..
[06:00:58] <PrinceES> it exists
[06:01:06] <aaronmcadam> does that alert fire
[06:01:15] <PrinceES> nope...
[06:01:18] <PrinceES> it doesn
[06:01:21] <PrinceES> that is the problem
[06:01:30] <aaronmcadam> then you need delegate
[06:01:39] <aaronmcadam> you must be adding it in your parseXML func
[06:01:47] <aaronmcadam> that does not mean "already exists on the page"
[06:02:04] <PrinceES> i also tried with almost all methodsw...
[06:02:36] <PrinceES> delegate(), onclick(), show(); onload(), onsubmit and etv.....
[06:02:39] <aaronmcadam> dude ffs
[06:02:42] <PrinceES> but it is the same...
[06:02:48] <joris> Hi. Is there any way the jQuery form validator is miscounting characters for maxlength input fields?
[06:02:53] <aaronmcadam> you're appending the link button in in your bloody ajax callback
[06:03:02] <aaronmcadam> you need delegate
[06:03:07] <aaronmcadam> show??
[06:03:11] <joris> I get invalid for an input item that is under the maxlength
[06:04:36] <PrinceES> ok...
[06:05:07] <PrinceES> i tried your way that you said to me,..... for replacing that parsexml code above of the ajax call
[06:05:08] <PrinceES> http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[06:05:12] <PrinceES> you can see now
[06:06:19] <aaronmcadam> it's slowww
[06:06:57] <PrinceES> now i have added delegate() method.. on it
[06:06:58] <PrinceES> http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[06:07:01] <PrinceES> see it please
[06:07:02] <KingDosser> What is the function that waits untill the line previous has finished before executing the next?
[06:07:14] <PrinceES> this parsexml has to be under the ajax...
[06:07:22] <PrinceES> because it has each method...
[06:07:23] <aaronmcadam> no it doesn't
[06:07:28] <PrinceES> ok ok
[06:07:38] <aaronmcadam> you should define your functions before u call them
[06:07:49] <aaronmcadam> those images are sooo big
[06:07:52] <aaronmcadam> in file size
[06:07:55] <caz_> Hi there
[06:08:01] <aaronmcadam> the damn thing isn't even loading right
[06:08:17] <aaronmcadam> i thought it was sposed to be a slider?
[06:08:32] <PrinceES> it is a slider
[06:08:46] <lanmower> princeEs you're jumping the gun
[06:08:47] <aaronmcadam> it's broken on mine
[06:08:53] <PrinceES> and each image size is in KB
[06:08:53] <lanmower> learn how javascript works
[06:08:58] <lanmower> learn how jquery works
[06:09:01] <lanmower> and try again.
[06:09:20] <aaronmcadam> lanmower++
[06:09:30] <lanmower> you're trying to build the eiffel tower with stone age knowledge, and it keeps falling apart, and you keep wondering why.
[06:09:31] <aaronmcadam> if only everyone actually tried to learn
[06:09:49] <PrinceES> <lanmower>  listen please
[06:09:56] <PrinceES> this is way to learn,..
[06:10:08] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam: I am still having problems. I am setting the html of a document, just before im calling the function to do the fading (which is in that html im loading). I think there is a problem with the data not being loaded before the function is called but am unsure of how to fix it. Could you please help me?
[06:10:09] <PrinceES> and i tried to make something which i used to think was impossible
[06:10:17] <PrinceES> on my code...
[06:10:26] <lanmower> if you're so confinced that you're going about it the right way, why are you failing so much.
[06:10:40] <PrinceES> there is a little bug... but the problem is that i dont know much about this problem
[06:10:49] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't work at all for me
[06:10:54] <lanmower> if you're learning the right way, why do we have to hold your hand on how to use firebug, how to write javascript syntax, on using correct html.
[06:11:07] <aaronmcadam> aaaaah
[06:11:07] <PrinceES> therefore, i need to know it from like as you expert guys
[06:11:14] <aaronmcadam> scripts in ajax-included html :S
[06:11:31] * aaronmcadam whacks KingDosser round the head
[06:11:33] <lanmower> shut up and listen for a change, you told me earlier I was an expert. well now an expert is telling you to read some books. follow his expert advice and become an expert.
[06:11:48] <caz_> I've got an isue in my code. I want to collapse all my sub items in my list, but my recursively function does not all the work... could anyone help me looking at it and giving me some feedbacks ? (here is the fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/cazsan/HfUFd/)
[06:12:05] <Paveloosha> guys, guys, guys ... you are doing quarrel
[06:12:06] <lanmower> you are trying to write an encyclopedia without seeing the world first, its the wrong way around.
[06:12:09] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam :) ?
[06:12:12] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:12:18] <aaronmcadam> we are doing quarrel :D
[06:12:22] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> thanks for your coming
[06:12:24] <PrinceES> :(
[06:12:31] <aaronmcadam> in soviet russia, quarrel does you :D
[06:12:38] <PrinceES> i am really out of my mind because of my bug
[06:12:59] <aaronmcadam> KingDosser do NOT include scripts in html you are going to include with ajax that's just stupid
[06:13:12] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/kzj3uyc8jsfx9pri4urjg aaronmcadam
[06:13:42] <Paveloosha> ha ha ha ha..
[06:13:44] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> Only want to know... it is really impossible to fix my problem...
[06:13:59] <PrinceES> beause i tried almost everyone way
[06:14:07] <Protomega> I hate it when one tiny character difference in a function can result in a working system.
[06:14:08] <PrinceES> but still having the same problem
[06:14:13] <Paveloosha> I am lughing
[06:14:30] <PrinceES> why r u laughing ?
[06:14:34] <aaronmcadam> KingDosser,
[06:14:40] <PrinceES> please help me
[06:14:47] <aaronmcadam> try putting show(0).css... .hide(0)
[06:14:47] <PrinceES> sorry for bothering you guys
[06:15:10] <kborchers> caz_: what is your problem? it seems that they all collapse for me
[06:15:18] <lanmower> PrinceES: You've been here trying to get people to fix your broken html insert since 5 hours ago. hammering and pestering and harassing the channels members. do you think you're doing the right thing learning this way? I've told you 10 minutes into your process your html insert was broken (ITS A BLOODY TEXT STRING NOT A JQUERY PROBLEM, LEARN HTML!), and 4 hours later I was still telling you that. Learn HTML markup. Learn JAVASCRIPT. Learn 
[06:15:20] <caz_> Expand first element
[06:15:25] <DEDOESSR071> anyone here using prettyPhotos?
[06:15:33] <caz_> kborchers: they almost expand all
[06:15:53] <kborchers> caz_: i see, ok let me look
[06:15:58] <fuchstronaut> I want to submit a form (method=post) to  a php-script passing get-vars, can i simply do it in the action attribute? action="index.php?name=fuchs" ?
[06:16:11] <KingDosser> What do you mean aaronmcadam
[06:17:09] <PrinceES> <lanmower>  sorry but.... i think there are something wrong inside my script...
[06:17:14] <aaronmcadam> where's the fiddle i made
[06:17:27] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/TDTyp/
[06:17:29] <aaronmcadam> got it
[06:17:34] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, checkout everything from the begaining.. codes are like onions.. you need to discover one by one..
[06:17:35] <Protomega> lanmower is correct (Assuming the story is correct) PrinceES.. Besides learn to troubleshoot your own scripts. It helps.
[06:17:36] <lanmower> but you're still hanging around asking 'why is it not working' while I told you the html string that you're inserting is not correct, because you're not getting the item in your dom. What does that tell you? fix the html string you're inserting.
[06:17:54] <aaronmcadam> or stop doing it that way
[06:17:57] <aaronmcadam> use a fooking template
[06:18:05] <joris> I'm curious about your code now, PrinceES. Let me see it.
[06:18:06] <lanmower> god, children.
[06:18:07] <aaronmcadam> appending html like that is sooo 2005
[06:18:17] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, templates? Ew.
[06:18:26] <lanmower> he's inserting some html into a dom, then trying to delegate a click on to it by id.
[06:18:30] <aaronmcadam> tf? u dare challenge
[06:18:39] <lanmower> but his string doesnt insert an item with that id into the dom
[06:18:42] <Protomega> tf?
[06:18:45] <joris> hehe.
[06:18:48] <lanmower> so theres no delegation.
[06:18:48] <aaronmcadam> you'd rather concatenate together html in an append() call
[06:18:56] <aaronmcadam> ahhh haha
[06:19:13] <Protomega> I just don't do templates :P
[06:19:16] <KingDosser> aaronmcadam: I know, for the rest of my site I don't. I just think its stupid to send an ajax call to return a static template.
[06:19:21] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> ok... i am checking each and everything again
[06:19:26] <PrinceES> for more deep way
[06:19:27] <aaronmcadam> don't do it KingDosser
[06:19:35] <aaronmcadam> you hate yourself then
[06:19:48] <Protomega> PrinceES, how about you try fixing your input and seeing if that works.
[06:19:58] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, nah, I do it to learn.
[06:20:12] <Shazer2> hey
[06:20:16] <Protomega> Hey
[06:20:18] <aaronmcadam> to learn??
[06:20:26] <aaronmcadam> learn how to do it right the first time Protomega
[06:20:32] <Shazer2> muley, you there?
[06:20:37] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, using a template isn't "right".
[06:20:40] <aaronmcadam> ?g jquery templates
[06:20:42] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Templates ñ jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[06:20:45] <aaronmcadam> yes it bloody well is
[06:20:56] <misterm> It really is sad how many scripts I see with like html = "some / 30 / line / html / with a million + interpolations + "
[06:21:19] <aaronmcadam> yep
[06:21:19] <fuchstronaut> I want to submit a form (method=post) to  a php-script passing get-vars too: <form method="post" action="index.php?name=fuchs">...</form> doesnt work :(
[06:21:26] <aaronmcadam> horrible to maintain
[06:21:32] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, okay but when you want to _learn_ the language(s),  using a template is not the best way to go.
[06:21:37] <Protomega> At least it isn't for me.
[06:21:37] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[06:21:46] <aaronmcadam> you're not getting it
[06:21:58] <aaronmcadam> templating for rendering html programmatically Protomega
[06:22:06] <lanmower> then he pastes a non-running excerpt of code from his site that doesnt work by itself into jsfiddle that we cant debug because IT DOESNT RUN and tells us that 'he's tried everything can we fix it'... an hour later he gives me the link to his site and asks me why theres no click delegation and I tell him over and over again since then that he's not inserting an item with that id into the dom correctly, because its not there. and yet he does
[06:22:07] <aaronmcadam> not for the actual language
[06:22:18] <joris> lanmower: url?
[06:22:19] <lanmower> then he pastes a non-running excerpt of code from his site that doesnt work by itself into jsfiddle that we cant debug because IT DOESNT RUN and tells us that 'he's tried everything can we fix it'... an hour later he gives me the link to his site and asks me why theres no click delegation and I tell him over and over again since then that he's not inserting an item with that id into the dom correctly, because its not there. and yet he does
[06:22:30] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, oo, you can beat me with a failstick now if you want. :3
[06:22:34] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, give up
[06:22:43] <aaronmcadam> ?fail @ Protomega
[06:22:46] <caz_> kborchers: any ideas of what's going on? I checked it several times, and nothing appeared wrong. I also tried to move my recursive call, but that does not work
[06:22:49] <aaronmcadam> ?js fail
[06:22:54] <aaronmcadam> where's it goneeee
[06:23:03] <kborchers> caz_: i think i'm on to your issue, just a minute
[06:23:18] <bot-t> Protomega, ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[06:23:18] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: <function fail() {return (![] + [])[+ []] + (![] + [])[+ !+ []] + ([![]] + [][[]])[+ !+ [] + [+ []]] + (![] + [])[!+ [] + !+ []];}>
[06:23:18] <aaronmcadam> KingDosser, here
[06:23:25] <aaronmcadam> KingDosser, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/TDTyp/3/
[06:23:31] <Protomega> Late response lol
[06:23:37] <lanmower> PrinceES: why doesnt my button event wouldnt work :( http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/7/
[06:23:38] <caz_> kborchers: Ok, wondefull :) Then i'll look at what's going wrong
[06:23:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah the bot's been shit the past while
[06:23:40] <Paveloosha> lanmower, give up :(
[06:24:11] * aaronmcadam PrinceES: "why doesn't my script work? whyyyyy"
[06:24:39] <aaronmcadam> PrinceES can you help me by looking at my site that doesn't actually work at all?
[06:24:48] <caz_> xD
[06:24:59] <lanmower> thats why I told him to learn html, javascript, xml, css, then he tells me no this is the right way to learn.
[06:25:12] <aaronmcadam> oh it's actually loading right now
[06:25:29] <lanmower> no javascript? no jquery. no html? no jquery. no css? no jquery, you need it all.
[06:25:34] <Protomega> lanmower, I actually don't know XML... I haven't run into needing it yet.
[06:25:48] <Paveloosha> @<lanmower>, please cool down :)
[06:25:49] <lanmower> Protomega html is xml
[06:25:52] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[06:26:02] <lanmower> so trust me you know the syntax :)
[06:26:05] <aaronmcadam> not exactly
[06:26:15] <aaronmcadam> html is sgml ;)
[06:26:17] <Protomega> lanmower, then... what is the difference and isn't saying learn XML meaning you will learn HTML at the same time?
[06:26:25] <AlexKourou> What the hell is sgml?:D
[06:26:26] <aaronmcadam> *nitpick*
[06:26:28] <lanmower> hahaha yeah ok aaronmcadam, you win :)
[06:26:38] <Protomega> Standard generalized Markup Language
[06:26:46] <aaronmcadam> no, he's right
[06:26:53] <AlexKourou> hah,thanks :D
[06:26:56] <kborchers> caz_: it is because your inner divs don't have the node class so they aren't being collapsed. but if you add it, it doesn't behave right as they are shown by default. hopefully that gets you on the right track. basically the parent divs are being collapsed but the child divs are not so they are visible when you expand the top level. make sense?
[06:26:57] <lanmower> Protomega if you cant write a bracket and slash right, you'll never do html
[06:26:58] <aaronmcadam> so many twats come in here expecting us to explain everything
[06:27:05] <aaronmcadam> and just complain when it doesn't work
[06:27:23] <aaronmcadam> or expect us to wade through shit code and immediately tell them what's wrong
[06:27:27] <lanmower> if you cant write a selector, or xml brackets right, or javascript you'll never do jquery. You can do with some blanks but not all.
[06:27:32] <aaronmcadam> instead of telling their boss they need training
[06:27:50] <caz_> kborchers: So, if I correctly understand, I need to collapse deepest div before the others
[06:28:00] <Protomega> lanmower, oh I know the connections, I just haven't used XML yet.. I think.. Maybe I have but didn't know?
[06:28:25] <lanmower> yeah you have, with html.
[06:28:35] <Protomega> Huh, interesting.
[06:28:36] <lanmower> <something></something>
[06:28:43] <lanmower> <something/>
[06:28:58] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't matter
[06:29:06] <Protomega> Wait so XML != XHTML?
[06:29:10] <aaronmcadam> you haven't really used xml until you've used XSLT/XPATH
[06:29:30] <aaronmcadam> xhtml is a language written in xml
[06:29:38] <lanmower> if you cant xml you cant html, because you wouldnt know how to close tags right, if you cant close tags right you cant give valid html as a string to a dynamic loader in jquery, he's jumping the gun.
[06:30:17] <aaronmcadam> it's mainly down to how he's rendering his html in one big append() string
[06:30:39] <caz_> kborchers: Oh, hell yes you'r right. I just put my recursive call before the instruction and everything worked well.
[06:30:53] <ericincoldohio> I'm using jqueryUI, I downloaded some image map PNGs with Icons for my theme.  How can I access a particular image in the map?
[06:30:56] <aaronmcadam> that's why I use templates for html, I never concatenate it
[06:30:59] <kborchers> caz_: cool, i was just typing something to that effect. glad you got it
[06:31:32] <caz_> kborchers: Thank you for your advices and your help. I really didn't tought about that
[06:31:44] <kborchers> caz_: np
[06:31:44] <caz_> thought
[06:32:07] <misterm> ericincoldohio: what do you mean by "access"?
[06:32:30] <ericincoldohio> like theres a plus icon in the map
[06:32:43] <Protomega> Okay so HTML and XML are both extended seperately from SGML. SGML is what introduced the brackets.
[06:32:59] <Shazer2> omg.
[06:33:01] <ericincoldohio> I wan to use in an image tag..is there some CSS already built into UI that handles these thypes of calls
[06:33:01] <Shazer2> why..
[06:33:06] <aaronmcadam> we're arguing semantics here
[06:33:07] <Shazer2> does my message continue to not display
[06:33:18] <aaronmcadam> cuz you suck? I dunno
[06:33:31] <lanmower> I'm a little muddy on the details and history, I have no degree on the subject.
[06:33:32] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, so the statement is false? Hi ericincoldohio :)
[06:33:35] <aaronmcadam> ericincoldohio, #jqueryui
[06:34:27] <aaronmcadam> nope it's fine Protomega
[06:34:31] <ericincoldohio> hi proto
[06:34:35] <lanmower> but if you cant read xml syntax you cant read html syntax, thats what I was trying to convey, broken xml wont load right and then you cant use the loaded content.
[06:34:39] <kborchers> ericincoldohio: basically what you do is set that png as the background of an element, like a span, that is the size of one image in the sprite, then you position the image so that only the one you want is visible. make sense? look at the css for jQuery UI and you'll see how we do it
[06:35:00] <qaov> hello, is there possibility to stop jquery script in desired place ?
[06:35:01] <misterm> ericincoldohio: also, that doesn't sound like an image map, it sounds like you're talking about sprites
[06:35:17] <Shazer2> toggle.js: http://mysticpaste.com/view/9444
[06:35:21] <misterm> ericincoldohio: an image map is something different
[06:35:26] <aaronmcadam> ericincoldohio, use firebug and tweak the background positions to see
[06:35:30] <KingDosser> Thanks aaronmcadam. :)
[06:35:31] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: there is no #jqueryui, support for that is here as well
[06:35:32] <Protomega> lanmower, ah, I gotcha. I can read xml but I don't believe I have used XML, even if I have used the same syntax
[06:35:35] <Shazer2> index.php: http://mysticpaste.com/view/9445
[06:35:36] <ericincoldohio> yeah sorry
[06:35:58] <aaronmcadam> oh cool kborchers
[06:36:03] <Shazer2> style.css: http://mysticpaste.com/view/9446
[06:36:12] <Shazer2> now, does anyone se anything wrong that wouldn't let it output
[06:36:20] <aaronmcadam> just a separate dev channel
[06:36:29] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: exactly
[06:36:34] <aaronmcadam> kk
[06:36:42] <joris> PrinceES: Don't assign the click before the xml is loaded and the html is appended.
[06:36:42] <misterm> ericincoldohio: if you're talking about a jQuery UI theme, there's probably a class(es) you could apply to your element to get the icon
[06:37:01] <joris> PrinceES: Assign the click from within the ajax callback function.
[06:37:04] <misterm> or you can just do it yourself as kborchers describes
[06:37:11] <aaronmcadam> no
[06:37:14] <ericincoldohio> I'll check out the CSS..think I can steel the code from accordion
[06:37:18] <aaronmcadam> use delegate outside
[06:37:29] <aaronmcadam> better idea
[06:37:32] <Protomega> lanmower, so XML is simply just lie being able to make your own elements?
[06:37:32] <lanmower> joris: we've covered that, he tried delegate too
[06:37:45] <aaronmcadam> Protomega, yep exactly
[06:37:51] <Shazer2> i guess nobody knows..
[06:37:52] <Shazer2> :/
[06:37:54] <PrinceES> see on it... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/21/
[06:37:56] <Protomega> Huh.. Interesting.
[06:37:59] <PrinceES> i have seen something....
[06:38:01] <AlexKourou> How can i get a urls  vars? some1=&some2=2 etc?
[06:38:03] <aaronmcadam> you assign a schema where u can define what those elements should hold
[06:38:14] <Paveloosha> does IE supports my own elements????
[06:38:23] <aaronmcadam> if you use a shiv
[06:38:29] <PrinceES> alert function wouldnt work under the method
[06:38:33] <PrinceES> append
[06:38:43] <lanmower> Protomega: html is a markup syntax, that allows you to define elements, elements with text in it for instance, elements with elements in it (hierarchies) elements with values, the way you can write the values (different quotes) etc
[06:38:49] <misterm> Shazer2: can you describe your problem more specifically?
[06:38:55] <joris> PrinceES: Swap the order of the append and the click
[06:39:08] <lanmower> joris: its not an order problem.
[06:39:20] <joris> it is in what he pasted last
[06:39:23] <lanmower> he's tried it with delegate and live et al
[06:39:35] <lanmower> he's also shown me the live site and theres no element by that id.
[06:39:35] <aaronmcadam> he probably doesn't understand both
[06:39:48] <lanmower> no element, no binding.
[06:39:50] <PrinceES> it is same
[06:39:51] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/22/
[06:39:59] <PrinceES> after swapping the order
[06:40:01] <aaronmcadam> i don't wanna look lol
[06:40:10] <Yanch0> http://pastebin.com/SJY5hubW anyone can pinpoint why my line 26 is not adding the a element to the span please?
[06:40:16] <joris> PrinceES: The order is still wrong in that script
[06:40:56] <PrinceES> i did http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/23/
[06:41:08] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, did you actually understood, what "<lanmower>" is trying pto say?
[06:41:12] <PrinceES> and still wouldnt work
[06:41:19] <PrinceES> yes...
[06:41:28] <Paveloosha> He is showing the actual coz?
[06:41:32] <PrinceES> but... there is something wrong inside my code...
[06:41:46] <kborchers> lanmower: you really dealt with this for 5 hours??? I have been here for 30 minutes and am already sick of it!
[06:41:52] <Protomega> THere is something wrong somewhere. That's for sure. :)
[06:41:52] <PrinceES> there is no html at alll
[06:41:56] <PrinceES> just a little code
[06:41:59] <aaronmcadam> kborchers what do u mean?
[06:42:08] <aaronmcadam> kborchers, the constant bullshit?
[06:42:10] <PrinceES> sorry... but if you want guys me out of this channel
[06:42:12] <kborchers> yep

[06:42:30] <PrinceES> because i have been trying to fix somethinv since yesterday..
[06:42:37] <lanmower> PrinceES we have no problem with you, its just your unwillingness to follow good advice.
[06:42:38] <PrinceES> and still havnt any solutions
[06:42:44] <aaronmcadam> kborchers most people are ok when they're sensible and can give u nice abstracted examples of their problems
[06:42:44] <juha___> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMv6Pr5oJws&feature=player_embedded
[06:43:04] <lanmower> You want: solution
[06:43:04] <lanmower> I want: you to learn.
[06:43:06] <PrinceES> lanmower, sorry.. But dont know how to check html insertion
[06:43:12] <aaronmcadam> and the whole "i have no time to do it properly, my time's more important than yours" mantra
[06:43:20] <Yanch0> ignore my query - figued it out :D
[06:43:28] <aaronmcadam> well done Yanch0
[06:43:34] <PrinceES> i tried to make very simple thing....
[06:43:56] <hansskov> help needed, i have an issue where when using jquery tmpl it returns an array of objects instead of just a single array like item, it adds some "text" objects that I can't figure out the source of
[06:44:02] <aaronmcadam> ?time
[06:44:30] <PrinceES> loot at this... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/24/ there is just 6 line of js code
[06:44:32] <misterm> Shazer2: It may seem obvious to you what you are doing because it's your code, but we don't know your code...descriptions like "it returns true" aren't terribly helpful
[06:44:41] <PrinceES> and very little code of html
[06:44:52] <aaronmcadam> misterm++
[06:45:00] <Shazer2> im trying to check if the login is true or false (worked/failed) if it works return true else false
[06:45:09] <Shazer2> if its true, display the successfully logged in message
[06:45:11] <Shazer2> via
[06:45:13] <Shazer2> a div id
[06:45:15] <misterm> Shazer2: sure, and where are you doing that?
[06:45:21] <Shazer2> in check.php
[06:45:29] <Shazer2> echo json_encode(array("result"=>true));
[06:45:32] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>,  you are adding listener before its existense..
[06:45:44] <misterm> Shazer2: I mean in Javascript, if you need help with PHP you'll have to go elsewhere
[06:45:48] <aaronmcadam> if he's using delegate that's fine Paveloosha
[06:46:10] <Paveloosha> he is not..
[06:46:11] <Shazer2> oh misterm
[06:46:15] <aaronmcadam> make sure your json is coming back properly from ur php Shazer2
[06:46:20] <Shazer2> if (returnData.result) {
[06:46:29] <aaronmcadam> ah christ, he's still not listening then
[06:46:39] <misterm> Shazer2: I have your pastebin up, you can just describe where in that
[06:46:41] <lanmower> PrinceES:
[06:46:41] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/23/
[06:46:56] <lanmower> does that satisfy your needs?
[06:47:07] <Shazer2> line 14
[06:47:14] <PrinceES> please just look at this code... http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/26/
[06:47:18] <PrinceES> a very little code
[06:47:18] <Shazer2> if its true, return success message
[06:47:18] <lanmower> no
[06:47:23] <lanmower> you look at my code
[06:47:27] <PrinceES> ok...
[06:47:32] <Shazer2> then redirect (commented), else return failure
[06:47:41] <misterm> Shazer2: ok, thanks...so your problem is that this message is not getting displayed?
[06:47:45] <Shazer2> exactly
[06:47:52] <lanmower> 1: thats how you post a fiddle, only one thing.
[06:48:01] <Paveloosha> ha ha ha ha..after all "lanmower" done that..
[06:48:05] <misterm> Shazer2: what browser are you using to develop?
[06:48:12] <Shazer2> chrome
[06:48:16] <lanmower> 2: it works, theres no jquery problem.
[06:48:22] <misterm> Shazer2: do you know how to use the developer tools?
[06:48:29] <lanmower> 3: if you have a html question join #html or somthing
[06:48:32] <antihero> Hey all.
[06:48:34] <aaronmcadam> oh the best one is
[06:48:43] <PrinceES> <lanmower> it doesnt work
[06:48:46] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, have u seen people post fiddles with mootools selected lol :D
[06:48:47] <antihero> Is there any way I can emulate the behaviour of a href="blah" target="_blank" ?
[06:48:50] <PrinceES> i am testing it on my chrome
[06:48:51] <Shazer2> misterm, i have been
[06:48:55] <Shazer2> nothing is appearing to me
[06:48:58] <PrinceES> and one button works and other one doesnt
[06:49:01] <lanmower> PrinceES it works.
[06:49:03] <antihero> IE opens new tab on most browsers.
[06:49:12] <lanmower> oh wait
[06:49:17] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/27/
[06:49:19] <misterm> Shazer2: ok, have you confirmed that your call is actually getting run?
[06:49:23] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, it is working..
[06:49:23] <lanmower> sorry my js fiddle didnt update
[06:49:24] <iksik> is it possible to determine, that .find() doesn't found anything?
[06:49:28] <Shazer2> misterm
[06:49:30] <Shazer2> yes, it does
[06:49:35] <Shazer2> as in verifyLogin();?
[06:49:36] <lanmower> PrinceES can you see the example there?
[06:49:44] <lanmower> is it working?
[06:49:44] <PrinceES> yes... i can see
[06:49:52] <aaronmcadam> WOWWWWW
[06:49:53] <PrinceES> nope... there are 2 button
[06:50:01] <kborchers> iksik: .length
[06:50:01] <ndee> is there a function to test if a string is blank?
[06:50:02] <lanmower> nope it has only one button
[06:50:02] <misterm> Shazer2: for example, right before line 12, if you put console.log("Logged in successfully"); does it show up in the console?
[06:50:03] <aaronmcadam> where's your donate button lanmower
[06:50:07] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/27/
[06:50:11] <Shazer2> misterm
[06:50:12] <PrinceES> 1 play movie which works
[06:50:14] <Shazer2> the callback isn't working
[06:50:14] <Shazer2> hmm.
[06:50:17] <Paveloosha> yes only one button
[06:50:22] <PrinceES> 2.PLAY Movie added inside append method  which doesnt work
[06:50:25] <Paveloosha> it is pworking
[06:50:31] <aaronmcadam> simples
[06:50:32] <lanmower> princees stop typing and read
[06:50:32] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/27/
[06:50:38] <lanmower> theres ONLY ONE BUTTON.
[06:50:41] <lanmower> IT WORKS.
[06:50:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:50:42] <Shazer2> misterm, i dont understand why
[06:50:42] <Paveloosha> ha ha ha
[06:50:47] <aaronmcadam> ?translate one button to spanish
[06:50:48] <PrinceES> yes,
[06:50:48] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Translation (English -> Spanish) - un bot√≥n
[06:50:50] <PrinceES> it works
[06:50:52] <PrinceES> i can see it
[06:51:00] <kborchers> antihero: not sure i understand your question. you just need to open a new window? you can't control if it opens in a tab or not, that is a browser preference
[06:51:17] <lanmower> can you see how theres only ONE html element, only 5 lines of js and it corners only ONE problem.
[06:51:22] <lanmower> thats how you fiddle.
[06:51:24] <misterm> Shazer2: in the chrome developer tools you should see a tab called "network", do you know how to use it?
[06:51:35] <Protomega> lanmower, may I message you?
[06:51:38] <aaronmcadam> kborchers: if u programmatically try to open a new tab, it causes popup blocking on chrome and maybe firefox
[06:51:42] <lanmower> you also do it while running firebug
[06:51:47] <lanmower> so you can see debug out.
[06:52:01] <Shazer2> not really
[06:52:04] <aaronmcadam> lanmower+++++++
[06:52:15] <aaronmcadam> high fuckin five
[06:52:21] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: right, i'm still trying to understand his question
[06:52:24] <aaronmcadam> we need a guide to jquery irc
[06:52:38] <aaronmcadam> kborchers, yeah dude, just a heads up :0
[06:52:42] <aaronmcadam> :)*
[06:52:45] <jetienne> q. any channger specific to qunit ?
[06:52:50] <lanmower> in fact, perhaps we should have a small wiki page on how to explain your problem and demonstrate it in fiddle, and a rule that no question that doesnt follow that gets answered.
[06:52:56] <Shazer2> i sort of so misterm
[06:53:00] <Shazer2> enought to get me through
[06:53:05] <misterm> Shazer2: just click it, and you should see your AJAX calls in there, make sure it's not failing
[06:53:18] <aaronmcadam> or some sort of secret password that u get after doing the tutorial lanmower
[06:53:21] <PrinceES> <lanmower> your little helped saved my alot of hours
[06:53:25] <misterm> Shazer2: also click it and make sure you are sending and getting back the data you think you are
[06:53:29] <aaronmcadam> that u can't get onto this channel without haha
[06:53:29] <PrinceES> thanks from my heart to you
[06:53:30] <KingTarquin> I'm using jquery ui datepicker, and when I go to change the year or month (after setting changeMonth and changeYear to true), it crashes chrome multiple times before I can select the value.
[06:53:55] <Shazer2> its returning true
[06:53:58] <lanmower> no PrinceES your hardheadedness wasted your whole day, I told you in the start that delegate works, and that your markup was incorrect before injection with append.
[06:54:00] <Shazer2> so it means the login credentials were correc
[06:54:00] <kborchers> ?demo @ KingTarquin
[06:54:02] <Shazer2> t
[06:54:05] <Shazer2> but the callback isn't executing
[06:54:06] <bot-t> KingTarquin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:54:06] <Shazer2> why not?
[06:54:10] <Protomega> lanmower, where is your code?
[06:54:20] <lanmower> Protomega my code?
[06:54:22] <aaronmcadam> lanmower i gave up ages ago, well done dude
[06:54:37] <lanmower> my code is all over the world, I contribute to several open source projects.
[06:54:47] <Protomega> Yea didn't you say you had code that made what s/he did work?
[06:55:06] <lanmower> yeah its http://jsfiddle.net/gDUZA/27/
[06:55:06] <misterm> Shazer2: in your callback, before you do anything else, do console.log(returnData) and tell me what is says
[06:55:31] <lanmower> its more of an example of how to ask for help with fiddle.
[06:55:33] <aaronmcadam> ?time
[06:55:33] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Google Time/Weather Information - ? time <City/State Name|Code>
[06:55:50] <aaronmcadam> ?time here
[06:55:51] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, No results found for 'here'.
[06:55:54] <Protomega> Has she found out why it works?
[06:55:57] <Protomega> s/he*
[06:56:18] <lanmower> Well I've told him over 20 times now that his live site has bad html in its injection line.
[06:56:29] <Shazer2> returns nothing misterm
[06:56:37] <aaronmcadam> why don't u give up
[06:56:39] <lanmower> so he's known the whole day, or he's ignored my text the whole day.
[06:56:54] <misterm> Shazer2: is the success callback getting executed?
[06:56:58] <Shazer2> no.
[06:57:06] <Shazer2> and i have no idea why
[06:57:07] <Shazer2> thats my problem
[06:57:25] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: because 10 o'clock this morning I set out to support two people on jquery with their problems, and one of them was still saying 'it doesnt work can you fix it' just now.
[06:57:28] <aaronmcadam> how can we get an IRC wiki up
[06:57:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah I've been in here since then too
[06:57:49] <lanmower> http://www.google.co.za/search?q=free+wiki&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[06:57:50] <misterm> Shazer2: and the request is not failing in your network tab?
[06:57:55] <aaronmcadam> we desparately need a wiki
[06:57:59] <Shazer2> do you mean going to check.php?
[06:58:05] <Shazer2> misterm ^
[06:58:08] <misterm> Shazer2: yes
[06:58:17] <Shazer2> check.php is not failing
[06:58:17] <lanmower> how about a google code wiki?
[06:58:17] <aaronmcadam> sick of people not knowing how to get help effectively
[06:58:21] <Shazer2> it does check.php
[06:58:23] <misterm> Shazer2: what does the status say
[06:58:24] <ericincoldohio> not jquery directly related but, any browsers have  a good w3c validation plugin?
[06:58:25] <aaronmcadam> google code sucks balls
[06:58:26] <Shazer2> but then won't execute the callback
[06:58:30] <Shazer2> status?
[06:58:36] <seutje> ?help
[06:58:36] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[06:58:36] <aaronmcadam> maybe github wiki
[06:58:41] <lanmower> a google code project is a great idea though because examples and files could be added...
[06:58:44] <seutje> ?commands
[06:58:44] <bot-t> http://bot-t.com/docs/
[06:58:48] <misterm> Shazer2: in the network tab there should be a column that says "status"
[06:58:49] <lanmower> or github yeah
[06:58:49] <aaronmcadam> or a part of the help section
[06:58:55] <seutje> ?down bot-t.com
[06:58:58] <bot-t> seutje, It's not just you! - http://bot-t.com looks down from here.
[06:59:02] <aaronmcadam> github would be the way to go
[06:59:21] <lanmower> does github have a wiki? (sorry I use amazon)
[06:59:22] <misterm> Shazer2: you're making sure to try logging in before checking the netork tab, right?
[06:59:24] <jetienne> q. has qunit been used with node.js ? is it compatible with it i mean
[06:59:34] <Shazer2> misterm: yes, but there is no "Status"
[06:59:50] <aaronmcadam> I'm not sure jetienne, you'd presume so seeing as jquery is built with node
[06:59:59] <lanmower> it would be nice to have a little example repository with clear concise examples on general tasks, and a wiki on how to ask and fiddle.
[07:00:02] <aaronmcadam> unless it fires a process to run the tests
[07:00:08] <KingTarquin> http://jsfiddle.net/2c6AQ/ When the input is clicked, and a new year is selected, it causes chrome to crash, same when selecting months as well.
[07:00:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah we'll have to ask paul lanmower
[07:00:49] <lanmower> yeah get the right people involved from the start.
[07:00:49] <misterm> Shazer2: do you mean there is no Status column or there is not an entry for your AJAX call?>
[07:00:49] <jetienne> aaronmcadam: well qunit is run inside the browser... ok i will try myself i guess. thanks
[07:01:02] <aaronmcadam> you can't run qunit headless?
[07:01:12] <lanmower> god I have a silly little problem...
[07:01:25] <aaronmcadam> jetienne?
[07:01:31] <Shazer2> misterm: no status thing
[07:01:46] <misterm> Shazer2: Im still not sure which one you mean
[07:01:53] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, what's your problem?
[07:02:06] <aaronmcadam> let me help u for a change
[07:02:10] <Shazer2> misterm: status, 200 ok
[07:02:41] <kborchers> KingTarquin: mine does not crash. maybe you have an addon that is conflicting?
[07:03:27] <lanmower> I'm dumping my ajax requests into a processing div, and then removing them from there and dumping them in the right places based on their attributes, I am using livequery (I dont know if you're familiar with it) to bind a submit function to it. For some reason, when they fall in the processing div (if I unhide it) it runs the submit function on the forms, however if I remove it from that div and append it to the correct div in the site, th
[07:03:32] <jetienne> aaronmcadam: dunno i will have to try i guess
[07:03:33] <seutje> ?weather Leicestershire
[07:03:34] <bot-t> seutje, Leicestershire - Time: 15:03 Wednesday (BST), Weather: Mostly Cloudy, 16∞C / 61∞F
[07:03:39] <aaronmcadam> cool man lemme know will ya?
[07:03:40] <jetienne> aaronmcadam: especially the runner
[07:03:49] <misterm> Shazer2: alright, all I can tell you is to just keep trying to narrow it down...I'd have to see a live page to help anymore
[07:04:13] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, no need to use livequery that shit's old
[07:04:14] <KingTarquin> kborchers: Disabled all extensions in chrome, still the same as soon as I click on a new year.
[07:04:34] <lanmower> aarnmcadam: is there another solution for delegate-style onload events?
[07:04:52] <aaronmcadam> livequery was written to implement live before live was added in 1.4
[07:05:03] <aaronmcadam> delegate won't work?
[07:05:16] <kborchers> KingTarquin: hmmm, does not crash for me. probably unrelated but FYI, you are using jQuery 1.6.2 with UI and it is not supported yet
[07:05:28] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: and it solves problems delagate cant solve, like running code on the addition of live content, not just on the firing of their events.
[07:05:30] <kborchers> neither is 1.6.1
[07:05:35] <aaronmcadam> lanmower go on, gimme a fiddle
[07:05:40] <lanmower> :)
[07:05:52] <lanmower> ok it will take me 10 mins or so to write it gimme a sec
[07:05:56] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you need pubsub lanmower
[07:06:04] <aaronmcadam> ?pubsub @ lanmower
[07:06:04] <bot-t> lanmower, jQuery publish/subscribe plugin by Peter Higgins http://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[07:06:51] <lanmower> sigh irc
[07:07:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:07:20] <aaronmcadam> u cud use pubsub
[07:07:25] <KingTarquin> kborchers: my bad, http://jsfiddle.net/2c6AQ/1/ that should be using 1.5.2 now, which crashes chrome :/
[07:07:30] <aaronmcadam> to set up a custom event really
[07:07:53] <aaronmcadam> so when you append in your live content, you publish the topic you've subscribed to
[07:07:56] <Protomega> http://pastebin.com/v2132zxM
[07:07:56] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[07:07:59] <Protomega> Question is in the paste
[07:08:33] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/pubsub-screencast
[07:08:37] <Protomega> Trying to see if I understand correctly. :)
[07:08:42] <aaronmcadam> Protomega, ya should put ur question in here too u know
[07:08:49] <aaronmcadam> so everyone can see without having to open ur paste
[07:09:07] <aaronmcadam> that's why we don't like pms
[07:09:09] <Protomega> Not really sure how to put the question in here though..
[07:09:14] <aaronmcadam> kk
[07:09:18] <BillCriswell> Protomega: ('#editPartForm') doesn't seem right.
[07:09:35] <kborchers> KingTarquin: still doesn't crash for me. what OS? also, is chrome the only browser that crashes?
[07:09:41] <Protomega> BillCriswell, oh?
[07:09:55] <misterm> Protomega: named function expressions like this are better avoided IMHO
[07:10:39] <BillCriswell> Protomega: I wasn't aware that would just return the string #editPartForm
[07:11:01] <Shazer2> misterm: look at PM
[07:11:16] <misterm> Protomega: if you need to reuse that function, just create a "regular" function and use it in both places
[07:11:49] <Protomega> So it would be .click(formUpdate);
[07:11:57] <KingTarquin> kborchers: On Linux, I'm just trying other browsers now, but I've just found a bunch of bugs in other browsers
[07:12:03] <misterm> Protomega: yea
[07:12:16] <Protomega> Awesome, so the delegation is correct as well?
[07:12:45] <kborchers> KingTarquin: let me pull up a Linux box and see if I see the issue.
[07:13:26] <misterm> Protomega: anywhere you would pass in a function expression you can pass in a reference to a function if that's what you're asking
[07:14:28] <Protomega> Nah just the delegation part, because I noticed a lot of examples use body and I chose to use td because that is where the clickable link thing is
[07:14:38] <Protomega> And I've never used delegate before so I wouldn't know :)
[07:15:33] <systemfault> Protomega: Delegates are wonderful for two things, collections of similar "objects", and to add handlers to dynamically generated content that changes often
[07:15:44] <systemfault> (.delegate or .live)
[07:15:54] <systemfault> (They both do the same thing)
[07:16:00] <KingTarquin> kborchers: Just tried in FF5.0, and it's working fine there. So it must be an issue with the version of chrome I'm using.
[07:16:57] <aaronmcadam> systemfault, yeah delegate is really handy for sets of objects
[07:17:18] <aaronmcadam> Protomega, always make sure though, that the context you give it doesn't get replaced by an ajax call
[07:17:28] <aaronmcadam> that can stump you easily
[07:17:53] <aaronmcadam> i.e. the context, the selector, must never change on the page
[07:18:02] <Protomega> Well I just tried the code and it doesn't seem to work.
[07:18:13] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ Prometheus
[07:18:13] <bot-t> Prometheus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[07:19:01] <BillCriswell> Protomega: Is ('#edit') what you expect it to be? Seems like you want $('#edit')
[07:20:04] <Protomega> What line Bill?
[07:20:04] <blackspotwiggins> KingTarquin, doesnt crash for me - linux/chrome
[07:20:25] <aaronmcadam> what version?
[07:20:43] <aaronmcadam> what distro blackspotwiggins ?
[07:20:46] <KingTarquin> blackspotwiggins: I think it's a version thing, I'm on 14.0.814.0.
[07:20:52] <blackspotwiggins> does it matter about distro?
[07:20:55] <blackspotwiggins> im on chrome13
[07:21:01] <blackspotwiggins> 14 is unstable
[07:21:02] <aaronmcadam> oh no, I'm just askin
[07:21:09] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: I've got livequery in, still need a few minutes :)
[07:21:23] <blackspotwiggins> so unstable means it might be crashhappy
[07:21:44] <systemfault> In reality, I had as much crashes on stable than unstable :P
[07:21:53] <systemfault> (perhaps I've just been lucky so far)
[07:22:06] <huglester_> systemfault: if I remmeber correct, version 10 or 11 was very crashy for me :)
[07:22:21] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, ubuntu natty btw
[07:22:22] <aaronmcadam> i'm only on 12
[07:22:22] <systemfault> I'm on 14.0.814.0
[07:22:30] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:22:34] <aaronmcadam> I'm still on 10.10
[07:22:36] <baubbelayponge> hey people
[07:22:42] <kborchers> KingTarquin: latest stable chrome for linux is 12.0.742.124, gonna say it's not an issue with datepicker
[07:23:14] <kborchers> KingTarquin: 14 is dev version, not even beta so gonna be very buggy
[07:23:14] <aaronmcadam> was thinkin of switching to fedora though, maybe debian
[07:23:27] <aaronmcadam> though don't know enough about package management yet
[07:23:33] <Topcat> I'm having trouble searching for the right erm but, when I come back to my page from the back button one of my plugins doesn't seem to fire. Page refresh and it works. What do I have ot make sure I've done other than have the plugin running fomr inside document.ready
[07:23:36] <aaronmcadam> even tho i've used linux like 4 years
[07:23:39] <blackspotwiggins> fedora is quite weird..
[07:23:50] <Shazer2> does anyonee know how to send back to JSON?
[07:23:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah I need to make sure i don't get the security edition
[07:23:59] <aaronmcadam> cuz it can block some python stuff
[07:24:12] <KingTarquin> kborchers: Yeah, I don't really come across many bugs, heh. But at least I know it works.
[07:24:13] <aaronmcadam> Shazer2: JSON.send()l
[07:24:15] <aaronmcadam> Shazer2: JSON.send();
[07:24:20] <blackspotwiggins> i was considering mint debian edition, but it was too unstable
[07:24:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:24:33] <aaronmcadam> heard about that
[07:24:35] <baubbelayponge> quick question : maybe i'm stupid, but why doesn't "$(this).siblings().index($(this));" work but "$(this).parent().children().index($(this))" does? (i need to find what number the element the user clicked on is)
[07:25:00] <blackspotwiggins> baubbelayponge, have you tried just $(this).index() ?
[07:25:13] <tbranyen> baubbelayponge: because ...
[07:25:15] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[07:25:16] <tbranyen> siblings doesn't include itself
[07:25:19] <Shazer2> nevermind
[07:25:22] <Shazer2> i dont feel like epxlaining
[07:25:22] <lanmower> no one suggested slackware?
[07:25:22] <baubbelayponge> oh
[07:25:23] <tbranyen> so how can it be indexed?
[07:25:25] <Shazer2> my whole problem again
[07:25:28] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, does it have to be a paste or can I just show you the site?
[07:25:30] <baubbelayponge> of course
[07:25:31] <baubbelayponge> thanks
[07:25:33] <tbranyen> baubbelayponge: np
[07:25:44] <aaronmcadam> smoke break brb
[07:25:49] <BillCriswell> Protomega: The line with ('#editPartForm')
[07:26:05] <Protomega> It's suppose to be '#editPartForm'
[07:26:59] <Mindore_> whats the fastest way to hide an object wth jquery?
[07:27:16] <blackspotwiggins> hide() ?
[07:27:20] <Protomega> Oh and I fixed it.
[07:27:29] <BillCriswell> Protomega: Just making sure.
[07:27:33] <Protomega> I forgot that " will turn basically anything into a string
[07:27:44] <Protomega> So "click" is not the same as 'click'
[07:27:51] <Mindore_> blackspotwiggins: yeah but in which state. if i use document ready its visible for a while
[07:27:51] <aaronmcadam> what?
[07:28:05] <aaronmcadam> single/double quotes make no difference Prometheus
[07:28:07] <blackspotwiggins> well yeah
[07:28:07] <aaronmcadam> Protomega
[07:28:12] <lanmower> aaronmcadam: just to familiarise yourself with what I'm doing, heres an example of what livequery does... I'll expand this now to exhibit the logistical problem that I'm facing. http://jsfiddle.net/cTYSs/
[07:28:13] <blackspotwiggins> because it's run on dom ready
[07:28:16] <blackspotwiggins> not immediately
[07:28:26] <Protomega> aaronmcadam, tell that to the machine that let it work :|
[07:28:41] <aaronmcadam> something else must have gone wrong then
[07:28:48] <lanmower> this cannot be done with delegate, its completely event independant and fires on load.
[07:28:50] <Protomega> Maybe
[07:29:01] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, have u looked at pubsub yet
[07:29:09] <aaronmcadam> Protomega, definately
[07:29:29] <aaronmcadam> think of how stupid it'd be if in a language single quotes did something differently that double
[07:29:39] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, like in php?
[07:29:47] <aaronmcadam> ahha well yeah
[07:30:08] <aaronmcadam> literals and variables contained within a string :D
[07:30:14] <aaronmcadam> bullshit :D
[07:30:47] <blackspotwiggins> there are some subtle differences in other languages as well
[07:30:50] <aaronmcadam> are u a php guy?
[07:31:20] <systemfault> aaronmcadam: Seriously...
[07:31:27] <aaronmcadam> wooo
[07:31:34] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, no
[07:31:40] <aaronmcadam> wuuuby
[07:31:41] <aaronmcadam> ?
[07:31:46] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[07:31:50] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:31:55] <systemfault> aaronmcadam: C... C++... Java... C#... etc... all differentiate strings from character with single vs double quotes.
[07:32:06] <lanmower> sorry aaron, do you wish me to watch the screencast before I elaborate on the problem?
[07:32:11] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[07:32:19] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, it would help u dude
[07:32:40] <Protomega> Uh... I just changed the code back to what it was before I switched to single quotes and it worked... I'm just going to write it off as I forgot to refresh
[07:32:48] <systemfault> In javascript, singlequotes are usually the best choice.
[07:33:18] <aaronmcadam> yea i always use them
[07:33:25] <aaronmcadam> unless of course there's double inside
[07:33:43] <aaronmcadam> and don't remind me of java :D
[07:33:55] <lanmower> aarnmcadam, I had a brief glance over the pubsub code and it looks syntatically weak compared to livequeries simplistic livequery() function. Let me watch the screen cast then before I complete my fiddle.
[07:34:04] <aaronmcadam> but yeah, it's easy to forget about how many types other langs have
[07:34:17] <blackspotwiggins> lanmower, livequery is slow. superslow
[07:34:21] <aaronmcadam> syntactically weak, eh?
[07:34:21] <dachary> Hi, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ does not explain how a .done() callback can return a deferred so that the chain is paused until it is resolved. It looks like the .done() callback has no way to say "wait until this deferred is resolved before you continue the callback chain". I mean like when a twisted defer callback returns a deferred http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html
[07:34:22] <blackspotwiggins> that's argument enugh
[07:34:39] <jeffsmykil> is it possible to turn a string into a dateobject?
[07:34:54] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, that plugin is literally 4 functions, using js .call() really and caching functions, simple as fuck
[07:35:42] <aaronmcadam> bout 20 lines long, there are more comments in the file than anything
[07:35:58] <aaronmcadam> i wouldn't use a plugin that's that old anyway
[07:36:14] <lanmower> gimme a sec, it takes time to watch the video :) I'm excited now
[07:36:15] * Mosselmaniac sais hi.
[07:36:32] <Mosselmaniac> lanmower: which video
[07:36:33] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil,
[07:36:42] <aaronmcadam> ?eval new Date('20/11/2011');
[07:36:42] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: <2012-08-10T18:30:00.000Z>
[07:37:15] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/pubsub-screencast
[07:37:26] <aaronmcadam> Mosselmaniac, ^ ^ ^
[07:40:40] <Protomega> Isn't there a way to completely get rid of an element?
[07:40:46] <sadmicrowave> .remove()
[07:41:06] <sadmicrowave> Protomega ^
[07:41:21] <sadmicrowave> $('element to remove').remove();
[07:41:24] <lanmower> so aaronmcadam, will pubsub allow me to run a function based on the addition of a new element to the dom's selector value (by its id or class) when it gets added?
[07:41:33] <lanmower> doesnt look like it
[07:41:43] <aaronmcadam> lanmower, you'd have to be smart
[07:41:47] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:41:53] <blackspotwiggins> lanmower, if you are adding new elements to dom
[07:42:00] <blackspotwiggins> you can check the id or class yourself, no?
[07:42:00] <aaronmcadam> in the function that appends in the content, publish an event
[07:42:12] <Sora_> hiya ppl
[07:42:12] <aaronmcadam> a topic i mean
[07:42:39] <aaronmcadam> i've always wondered if there's a way to hook into the creation of an element tho
[07:42:52] <Protomega> So would .remove($(this).parent("tr")) remove the tr and the td's inside?
[07:43:06] <aaronmcadam> yes Protomega
[07:43:09] <sadmicrowave> yes
[07:43:13] <Protomega> Very nice
[07:43:14] <lanmower> aaron, I'm only interested in a syntatically clean way to hook element creation, and only livequery does this right.
[07:43:25] <sadmicrowave> Protomega,  .remove() will remove the selected element and all its children
[07:43:28] <aaronmcadam> yea but livequery is an old plugin
[07:43:36] <lanmower> when jquery delegate gets that feature (that livequery has) I'll dump lq of course.
[07:43:39] <aaronmcadam> and pubsub couldn't be any cleaner
[07:43:50] <aaronmcadam> it's just using functional js
[07:43:55] <Protomega> Just gotta make sure it only takes away that <tr> of course :P
[07:44:02] <lanmower> but it doesnt hook item addition.
[07:44:11] <Protomega> Hmm maybe I should just test the stuff in jsfiddle instead of constantly refreshing.
[07:44:13] <lanmower> so its out of the context of my use.
[07:44:13] <blackspotwiggins> afaik you cant pass jquery objects to remove()
[07:44:20] <aaronmcadam> i'm saying publish a topic when you add the item
[07:44:31] <aaronmcadam> simple
[07:44:49] <lanmower> I'm not interested in publishing topics, I'm interested in running a peice of jquery when dom elements get added.
[07:44:49] <Protomega> blackspotwiggins, why wouldn't you be able to?
[07:44:57] <blackspotwiggins> well you could pass anything
[07:45:03] <blackspotwiggins> but it wouldnt do what you expect
[07:45:14] <blackspotwiggins> lanmower, you are adding that piece yourself
[07:45:17] <sadmicrowave> blackspotwiggins, I think you are right, you would have to do $(this).parent().find('tr').remove()
[07:45:19] <aaronmcadam> how are u adding the elements
[07:45:27] <blackspotwiggins> just write that code there
[07:45:30] <aaronmcadam> are you following me at all?
[07:45:49] <aaronmcadam> if you're programmatically adding elements, you can publish whatever u need
[07:45:58] <aaronmcadam> and run whatever
[07:46:03] <lanmower> I'm adding elements in various different ways, and lq gives me a hook for that, theres nothing wrong with doing that.
[07:46:22] <blackspotwiggins> lanmower, you are doing it wrong
[07:46:40] <aaronmcadam> don't turn into PrincesES :(
[07:47:47] <Protomega> Are you able to tab in jsfiddle because of javascript?
[07:48:30] <jeffsmykil> what format does a string have to be in to parse to a date?
[07:48:56] <blackspotwiggins> ?mdc Date.parse @ jeffsmykil
[07:49:00] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn date @ jeffsmykil
[07:49:02] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, parse - MDN Docs - Parses a string representation of a date, and returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse
[07:49:16] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Thursday, 2011-06-30 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110630.log.html
[07:49:32] <aaronmcadam> ignore that haha
[07:50:00] <jeffsmykil> i think I got it
[07:50:01] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[07:53:46] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, is there a way to focus the viewport on an element?
[07:54:06] <guy> how can I check if the object already has click event binded?
[07:54:22] <t4nkd> s/binded/bound/
[08:01:06] <t4nkd> Is there an equivilant function for what equates to clicking an anchor containing the ID of an element on page?
[08:01:13] <Whirl3d> without being yelled at, could someone help me with  a simple, simple plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/3KkqC/2/
[08:01:30] <aaronmcadam> t4nkd, you want to trigger a click?
[08:01:31] <systemfault> t4nkd: Just call .click() on the node
[08:01:39] <aaronmcadam> $( id ).click()
[08:01:43] <t4nkd> Oh yeah I got that, tyty
[08:02:01] <aaronmcadam> cool
[08:02:07] <t4nkd> But I didn't want to create a bunch of hidden anchors for containers
[08:02:26] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[08:02:48] <aaronmcadam> what u trying to do?
[08:02:50] <systemfault> t4nkd: Why don't you tell us what you're trying to achieve?
[08:02:55] <t4nkd> Yeah working on explaining that
[08:03:01] <systemfault> Typical case of XY problem
[08:03:07] <aaronmcadam> haha what?
[08:04:00] <systemfault> aaronmcadam: The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that, either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
[08:04:22] <blackspotwiggins> systemfault, that's a nice explanation
[08:04:27] <t4nkd> Oh, no that's not really it; I just want to focus the viewport on an element as a callback to .click()
[08:04:28] <blackspotwiggins> that happens all the time here tho
[08:04:33] <systemfault> Thank the bot in ##Javascript :P
[08:05:07] <blackspotwiggins> "focus the viewport" ?
[08:05:17] <t4nkd> Is focus the wrong word?
[08:05:44] <blackspotwiggins> well, focus has a meaning in the context of html/webdev
[08:05:57] <Whirl3d> Really simple issue--could be solved in less than a minute: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/3KkqC/2/
[08:06:00] <blackspotwiggins> but you usually focus on elements not viewport
[08:06:20] <t4nkd> Right, I see what you mean
[08:06:23] <systemfault> t4nkd: <a> is made for that.
[08:06:33] <phlp> t4nkd: window.location = window.location.pathname + '#foo'
[08:06:47] <t4nkd> phlp: I think that's what I need, thanks man
[08:06:53] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, just use $(selector).length
[08:07:30] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, thanks for the suggestion. did you read the comment? .length() doesn't work in the same context.
[08:07:41] <blackspotwiggins> 1)
[08:07:46] <blackspotwiggins> i didnt write l
[08:07:48] <blackspotwiggins> .length()
[08:07:54] <Whirl3d> sorry, type
[08:07:59] <Whirl3d> *typo
[08:08:10] <blackspotwiggins> 2) exists() and .length should be functionally the same
[08:08:15] <aaronmcadam> length is a property, not a function
[08:08:38] <Whirl3d> var page=$("#"+pageName).length>0||addPage(pageName) does work
[08:08:51] <blackspotwiggins> you dont need >0
[08:08:51] <Whirl3d> sorry, i typed it wrong
[08:08:52] <aaronmcadam> and you don't need >0
[08:09:12] <Whirl3d> Just two days ago, there was a big argument about whether you needed >0 or not
[08:09:15] <aaronmcadam> heh covering each other ther
[08:09:19] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[08:09:22] <aaronmcadam> idiots
[08:09:39] <blackspotwiggins> if you are checking whether an element exists in dom
[08:09:41] <blackspotwiggins> you dont need >0
[08:09:41] <ravenzz> you don't
[08:09:48] <systemfault> > 0 is just more explicit, it's unecessary though
[08:09:50] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:24: parse error on input `,'
[08:09:59] <ravenzz> if the element doesn't exist you will have 0
[08:10:04] <ravenzz> 0 == false
[08:10:17] <aaronmcadam> but !== :D
[08:10:34] <aaronmcadam> I love type coercion :D
[08:10:45] <systemfault> I hate it ;)
[08:10:51] <misterm> eh, it's good and bad
[08:10:55] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, that line makes no sense, maybe you should try explaining wtf you are trying to accomplish
[08:10:56] <aaronmcadam> it's good when you understand it
[08:11:00] <misterm> depending on if it's doinf what you want or not
[08:11:08] <rhino> is it possible to alert an object?
[08:11:16] <ravenzz> 8==D
[08:11:21] <misterm> rhino: for what purpose?
[08:11:21] <systemfault> aaronmcadam: I do, I just don't like magic.... perhaps I'm too used to more "classical" languages.
[08:11:21] <aaronmcadam> you'll just get Object object
[08:11:31] <aaronmcadam> use firebug rhino
[08:11:32] <misterm> rhino: if you're debugging, learn to use the console
[08:11:32] <ravenzz> rhino console.debug(element) is better
[08:11:48] <aaronmcadam> console.dir will unwrap the object either
[08:11:58] <aaronmcadam> cool systemfault
[08:12:33] <aaronmcadam> haha I remember some dude was asking me about if js was "contemporary"
[08:12:36] <misterm> a little bit of magic is a wonderful thing
[08:12:39] <aaronmcadam> cuz i talked about classical OO
[08:12:50] <blackspotwiggins> lols
[08:12:52] <systemfault> :/
[08:12:55] <blackspotwiggins> its postmodernist!
[08:12:56] <aaronmcadam> my god he hadn't a clue
[08:12:59] <aaronmcadam> I said
[08:13:12] <aaronmcadam> $.mondrian = function() { ... }
[08:14:08] <blackspotwiggins> if you think js is magic
[08:14:14] <blackspotwiggins> check out coffeescript
[08:14:17] <aaronmcadam> haskell :D
[08:14:23] <systemfault> Coffeescript is nice :D
[08:14:23] <blackspotwiggins> magic^2
[08:14:24] <blackspotwiggins> literally
[08:14:37] <aaronmcadam> coffeescript does crazy things with the prototype
[08:14:41] <misterm> ha, actually I would say there isn't much magic in Coffeescript
[08:14:45] <aaronmcadam> mad work
[08:14:48] <blackspotwiggins> it's too dumbed down IMO
[08:14:54] <blackspotwiggins> impossible to debug
[08:14:57] <aaronmcadam> it lets people gloss over learning js
[08:15:05] <blackspotwiggins> and thats a good thing?
[08:15:15] <aaronmcadam> i'm saying that it's a bad thing
[08:15:18] <misterm> I disagree with all those things
[08:15:23] <aaronmcadam> it's ok if u understand js properly
[08:15:25] <aaronmcadam> maybe
[08:15:26] <blackspotwiggins> it makes average developer even more dumber
[08:15:32] <aaronmcadam> like using haml for html or sass for css
[08:15:41] <blackspotwiggins> durr, make a jquery plugin for adding integers type of stuff
[08:15:45] <aaronmcadam> haha yep :D
[08:15:49] <aaronmcadam> $.add(1,2)
[08:15:50] <misterm> I've never had problems debugging it, and I think you'd have a lot of trouble using it without knowing js at least passingly well
[08:16:07] <aaronmcadam> I'm always telling people in here to try the jQuery JavaScript plugin :D
[08:16:22] <systemfault> jQuery is a mess though
[08:16:24] * systemfault hides.
[08:16:29] <aaronmcadam> some are like wooo :D and then.. ohh shit
[08:16:43] <blackspotwiggins> misterm, the thing is coffeescript is compiled into js, and debuggers show you errors in cs code
[08:16:55] <blackspotwiggins> if it were executed natively, it'd be better
[08:17:00] <blackspotwiggins> but meh
[08:17:09] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: well, what sort of debugging do you do?
[08:17:16] <blackspotwiggins> havent done any for myself
[08:17:20] <blackspotwiggins> since i dont use it
[08:17:29] <misterm> I mean in JS
[08:17:41] <misterm> Syntax errors are caught by the CS compiler
[08:17:41] <aaronmcadam> firebug's debugger rules
[08:17:52] <aaronmcadam> it's never syntax errors that I debug
[08:17:55] <systemfault> Browsers are beginning to implement hints for languages that compiles to JS can use to help debugging
[08:17:56] <misterm> So after that, the majority of debugging I do is tracking down stupid errors I made
[08:17:58] <blackspotwiggins> not syntax errors usually
[08:18:09] <misterm> For example, passing arguments in the wrong order
[08:18:11] <blackspotwiggins> when i need to use firebug/devtools debugger, its usually deep shit already
[08:18:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:18:22] <aaronmcadam> watch statements
[08:18:28] <aaronmcadam> and a few break points
[08:18:34] <misterm> debugging AJAX requests, debugging API calls, etc
[08:18:40] <aaronmcadam> instead of console.log everywhere
[08:18:41] <misterm> none of that stuff is really affected by using CS
[08:19:11] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, aaronmcadam et al, thanks for your help. jQuery.fn.exists = function(){return jQuery(this).length;} works great.
[08:19:14] <misterm> The only difference is that the error message you get doesn't have the exact line number in your source code, but that's not even a given with JS
[08:19:23] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, that's stupid
[08:19:28] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d, just call .length
[08:19:31] <aaronmcadam> that's retarded
[08:19:38] <Whirl3d> so, it's my code stfu
[08:19:50] <aaronmcadam> calling a function that just calls exactly what we said to do
[08:19:52] <blackspotwiggins> $.fn.self = function() { return this }; // can i has plugin?
[08:19:58] <aaronmcadam> hahahaa
[08:20:17] <systemfault> blackspotwiggins: Then you can chain with it to death
[08:20:34] <aaronmcadam> why don't you just use .size() as well to increase your retardation
[08:20:35] <blackspotwiggins> ok, better version
[08:21:04] <blackspotwiggins> $.fn.self = function() { return Math.random()>0.83 ? this : null }; // can i has plugin? (RUSSIAN ROULETTE)
[08:21:31] <aaronmcadam> hmmm can I pass the 0.83 part as an option please?
[08:21:32] <aaronmcadam> :D
[08:22:04] <systemfault> blackspotwiggins: Would be cooler if you could decorate all the existing functions on the jQuery object to do that
[08:22:10] <blackspotwiggins> anyway, one last thing about CS - i think it's ok to use IF you understand what it does and not just use it blindly
[08:22:25] <blackspotwiggins> the same with jquery actually
[08:22:32] <systemfault> A bit weird that we have that conversation here...
[08:22:51] <systemfault> I mean, it's #jQuery... there's tons of people who don't even know JS.
[08:22:57] <phrearch> hm, somehow if i update a div's text on keypress, the text blinks a fraction of a second. any idea how to prevent this?
[08:22:58] <aaronmcadam> i looked at a decorator pattern for js recently btw
[08:22:58] <misterm> blackspotwiggins: yea, I'd say they server similar purposes
[08:23:21] <phrearch> like the text dissappears, and gets rebuild real quick, but you see the text dissappear for a while
[08:23:25] <misterm> ha, CS lets you decorate pretty nicely :-D
[08:23:36] <aaronmcadam> systemfault, so many people don't even have a grasp of programming or software engineering in here
[08:23:56] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, that's true, but at least some are willing to learn
[08:24:00] <aaronmcadam> yep
[08:24:14] <guy> $(this).prevAll(':not()')
[08:24:17] <misterm> decorated = (fn) -> (args...) -> fn.apply(this, args)   .... then you can do foo = decorated () -> x()
[08:24:21] <guy> how to find all NOT hidden elements?
[08:24:22] <systemfault> blackspotwiggins: The problem is that they're here and not on ##Javascript ;)
[08:24:29] <blackspotwiggins> well
[08:24:43] <blackspotwiggins> since this place is much more active, it makes sense to ask here
[08:24:48] <molavy> why i can't access to function from one file from another
[08:24:49] <molavy> ?
[08:25:07] <misterm> molavy: scope issues? could be lots of things
[08:25:08] <phrearch> ah never mind :S
[08:25:19] <aaronmcadam> ?:hidden @ guy
[08:25:19] <bot-t> guy, :hidden: Selects all elements that are hidden. http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[08:25:21] <blackspotwiggins> it's hard and frustrating to deal with, but some community is always taking the worst batch of newbies. even more so, we should try to educate them
[08:25:32] <molavy> like this function showalarm(){}in one file ,and in second showalarm();
[08:25:37] <blackspotwiggins> guy, also :visible
[08:25:41] <kborchers> ?:visible @ guy
[08:25:41] <bot-t> guy, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[08:25:47] <aaronmcadam> true
[08:25:49] <rhino> can anyone help me figure out why I am recieving the following 2 errors when trying to modify jquery.fileupload-ui.js:
[08:25:53] <rhino> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_adjustMaxNumberOfFiles' of undefined - jquery.fileupload-ui.js:109
[08:25:54] <rhino> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_renderDownload' of undefined - jquery.fileupload-ui.js:112
[08:26:01] <misterm> molavy: yea, like I said...it could be a lot of things...the file could not be loading, you could have an error, scope issues
[08:26:12] <rhino> here is the gist:  https://gist.github.com/1080235
[08:26:20] <molavy> showhidealarm is not defined						showhidealarm();
[08:26:25] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins, does that cover the confusion over visibility and display properties?
[08:26:47] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, not entirely sure
[08:26:52] <sdemi> Hi, I'm trying to implement tabs (http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/) which version of jquery can this run on 1.6.x or the newer 1.8.x?
[08:26:54] <aaronmcadam> never really used it enough to find out
[08:26:57] <blackspotwiggins> but you cant really test if something is visible with js anyway
[08:27:17] <aaronmcadam> browser inconsistencies?
[08:27:27] <aaronmcadam> box model madness
[08:27:29] <blackspotwiggins> you can position stuff on top of eachother
[08:27:34] <aaronmcadam> specification shit
[08:27:38] <aaronmcadam> true
[08:27:39] <blackspotwiggins> so it would be "visible", but not really
[08:27:56] <mattalexx> Is this the best way to stop an event from happening? http://pastebin.com/7vSpdXP8
[08:28:18] <Assimilater> can someone here do me a favor and tell me if you can connect to http://callserver.dyndns.biz? I think the public wifi i'm using is blocking it, and want to make sure it's still up
[08:28:27] <Assimilater> (it will be a fedora test page)
[08:28:35] <blackspotwiggins> ?down  http://callserver.dyndns.biz @ Assimilater
[08:28:38] <bot-t> Assimilater, It's not just you! - http://callserver.dyndns.biz looks down from here.
[08:28:56] <Assimilater> didn't know bot-t could do that, lol
[08:28:56] <phlp> works for me
[08:28:59] <sdemi> Assimilater: its up for me
[08:29:12] <Assimilater> ok, thanks
[08:29:42] <rhino> anybody???
[08:29:53] <sdemi> What version of jquery are these tabs for? http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[08:29:58] <misterm> That's why I always tun web over ssh when working in coffeeshops, well amongst other reasons
[08:30:07] <blackspotwiggins> sdemi, 1.8 is for 1.4+
[08:30:11] <blackspotwiggins> or was it 1.3+
[08:30:21] <blackspotwiggins> it says that on download page
[08:30:46] <sdemi> blackspotwiggins: so i cant use tabs for v1.6?
[08:30:58] <blackspotwiggins> are you serious?
[08:31:05] <blackspotwiggins> do you know what "+" means?
[08:31:11] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[08:31:37] <sdemi> "1.8 is for 1.4+" i dont know what that means
[08:31:48] <sdemi> yes i know what plus means
[08:31:51] <molavy> above error raised,but code outside of function work well,(in document ready
[08:32:13] <blackspotwiggins> (jqueryui) 1.8 is for (jquery) 1.4+
[08:32:34] <blackspotwiggins> 1.3.2 even
[08:32:37] <BillCriswell> 1.3.2+
[08:32:37] <molavy> misterm.but when i put them inside function and call it from second file error raised
[08:33:34] <misterm> molavy: yea, like I said...that could be a lot of things...you'd have to show what you're working on to narrow it down
[08:34:20] <aaronmcadam> ah i got a headache from being on here all day
[08:34:29] <aaronmcadam> been especially bad today i think
[08:35:45] <misterm> molavy: all I can say is you should be able to access a function in one file from another one, if you can't you
[08:35:54] <misterm> are probably doing something wrong
[08:36:11] <molavy> i will show in moment
[08:38:36] <molavy> http://dpaste.com/567833/
[08:39:41] <guy> guys, I have an issue. http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/ click on the video, click again on play. now click again on the video. the mouse cursor is locked. what can I do about this? what's the mistake?
[08:39:54] <kborchers> molavy: why are you waiting until the dom is ready to define a function?
[08:40:30] <misterm> molavy: you have scope issues
[08:41:04] <kborchers> molavy: ^^^^
[08:41:09] <molavy> misterm,it's because i put it inside document.ready function.i got it
[08:41:21] <bgy> hi
[08:41:32] <misterm> molavy: yea, if you define a function inside a function, it's only accessible inside that function
[08:42:08] <guy> anyone
[08:42:08] <guy> ?
[08:42:55] <bgy> let's I have such array [jQuery('#foo'), jQuery('#bar')] and I want to bind an event on each, do I have to use $.each(array, function() { this.bind() } or is there a simpler method? I tried to do jQuery(array).bind() but it doesn't work
[08:43:30] <blackspotwiggins> bgy, $("#foo, #bar").bind() is pretty simple
[08:43:36] <molavy> i think it must be inside that because i use jquery function and they don't work outside document.ready function
[08:45:05] <kborchers> molavy: not true, jQuery will work as soon as the library is loaded, you just can't manipulate the dom until it is ready
[08:45:24] <bgy> blackspotwiggins: yeah I know that, but I construct that from a loop
[08:45:43] <blackspotwiggins> you are doing it in a very obscure way then
[08:46:11] <bgy> blackspotwiggins: so I get an array of jquery element
[08:46:22] <blackspotwiggins> yeah i got that
[08:46:41] <blackspotwiggins> you probably shouldnt
[08:47:13] <bgy> blackspotwiggins: but I don't know the elements they're dynamic it's why I use a loop to get them
[08:47:44] <blackspotwiggins> your example had selectors, but
[08:47:47] <sherjilozair> When I'm using $.append or $.html, Jquery is adding extra stuff to my html which I don't want.
[08:47:52] <blackspotwiggins> create the array from regular dom elements
[08:47:58] <blackspotwiggins> then use $(array).bind
[08:47:59] <blackspotwiggins> should work
[08:48:15] <skypce> hi guys, i want add a <tr><td> label[for] </td></tr> how can i do it , thanks :D
[08:48:19] <kborchers> ?demo @ sherjilozair
[08:48:20] <bot-t> sherjilozair, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:49:47] <sherjilozair> kborchers: I'll make a demo. But tell me this, when I do $.html(string), does jquery add extra things along with it. I want only the string to be added, nothing else.
[08:50:06] <bgy> blackspotwiggins: well It actually does not
[08:50:13] <kborchers> sherjilozair: no, it should not add anything extra
[08:50:22] <impi> has anyone here used date.js? i am trying to say something like "this weekend" i am trying this but for some reason, the first friday works, but the end date is the same..? dateStart: 'Friday', dateEnd: 'Friday+2days'
[08:50:44] <impi> it doesnt add the 2 days..
[08:52:51] <blackspotwiggins> bgy, http://jsfiddle.net/3eDGT/
[08:53:09] <skypce> how can i add a html to a #id ? please
[08:53:35] <ralphholzmann> skypce: $("#id").html("<p>paragraph</p>");
[08:53:49] <unclemantis> how do i animate the date and time so that it always shows the current date and time without reloading the page?
[08:54:05] <mattalexx> skypce, What ralphholzmann said will replace the contents of your element instead of append
[08:54:28] <skypce> ralphholzmann, thank yout
[08:54:43] <sherjilozair> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQ5Mz/3/ , if you click inspect element on the hi, you'll see the discrepancy in the table.
[08:55:06] <skypce> mattalexx,  i want add a <tr> <td > element in a label
[08:55:13] <ralphholzmann> good call mattalexx
[08:55:18] <BillCriswell> unclemantis: setInterval() should help... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setinterval
[08:55:18] <blackspotwiggins> sherjilozair, append uses elements
[08:55:20] <blackspotwiggins> not plain text
[08:55:31] <blackspotwiggins> so just go <td>hi</td>
[08:55:32] <defrex> is there a simple way to detect wether a given $ instance is already in the document or not?
[08:55:59] <misterm> defrex: depends on what you mean
[08:56:02] <blackspotwiggins> defrex, if($) ?
[08:56:14] <misterm> defrex: you can detect if window.$ exists and if it's jQuery
[08:56:47] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: Can I be in complete control over my html ?
[08:56:49] <misterm> well, for the most part, it could be a fake in theory, but don't lets be paranoid
[08:57:08] <blackspotwiggins> sherjilozair, sure
[08:57:11] <unclemantis> BillCriswell this has nothing to do with JQUERY but ok :)
[08:57:20] <defrex> no, I mean the differance between $('<div>') and $('#myDiv') (or $('<div>').appendTo('#myDiv'))
[08:57:23] <blackspotwiggins> manipulate innerHTML on dom elements
[08:57:44] <defrex> is the node in the dom or not?
[08:57:47] <blackspotwiggins> you cant force dom into invalid state i think
[08:57:51] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: the syntax is ? This is non-jquery right ?
[08:58:23] <misterm> defrex: not sure what you mean
[08:58:43] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: You mean, there can't be any moment when the html is bad.
[08:58:52] <blackspotwiggins> in DOM, no
[08:59:03] <blackspotwiggins> so not sure why you would want to do that anyway
[08:59:37] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: That happens in the process. I just want to make a table of values from a JSON array of arrays.
[08:59:53] <blackspotwiggins> .. and what?
[08:59:53] <sherjilozair> Is there a clean way (some library function) to do this ?
[09:00:27] <blackspotwiggins> is there a reason you cant inject entire cells at one time?
[09:00:47] <misterm> defrex: the difference between those is that the first are two separate things and the latter will create a div and append it to another
[09:01:10] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: Cells I think I'll manage, but not rows.
[09:01:34] <bgy> blackspotwiggins: thank you
[09:01:54] <blackspotwiggins> sherjilozair, var row = $("<tr>"); row.append("<td>lol</td"); row.appendTo("table")
[09:02:13] <blackspotwiggins> just construct in memory first, then add to real dom
[09:02:20] <blackspotwiggins> for SPEED!!
[09:02:36] <defrex> $('<div>') returns an element which is not currently in the dom. It's just a fragment that can be inserted later. #('#myDiv') selects a div which is currently in the dom. I need to tell between the two, that is, I need to tell is the element I have is in the DOM or not.
[09:03:04] <impi> can someone please tell me when i use this: http://www.datejs.com/ my string like this doesnt work: dateStart: 'Friday', dateEnd: 'Friday+2days' my  dateStart gives the correct date, my dateEnd doesnt, - it gives the same date as dateStart :(
[09:03:04] <blackspotwiggins> defrex, $.contains(document.body, somejqueryobject[0])
[09:03:35] <defrex> aha! thanks, blackspotwiggins
[09:03:37] <phlp> defrex: if ($('<div></div>')[0].parentNode == null)
[09:03:47] <impi> all i really want is the dates of this coming weekend :( poooh
[09:03:59] <blackspotwiggins> impi, is dateStart part of date.js?
[09:04:14] <blackspotwiggins> where are you using it?
[09:05:04] <impi> blackspotwiggins, i use it here dev.micket.me | check the When input. i am using the excellent date picker from http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_date_range_picker_with_jquery_ui/
[09:05:16] <blackspotwiggins> you cant just pass date.js strings to datepicker
[09:05:17] <defrex> I imagine phlp's solution would perform better, so I shall go with that.
[09:06:04] <blackspotwiggins> impi, also, that datepicker is super super super old
[09:06:06] <sherjilozair> blackspotwiggins: What does this do ? "var row = $("<tr>");" ? The <tr> doesnt have to be in the html at this moment, right ?
[09:06:07] <blackspotwiggins> use the jqueryui one
[09:06:24] <impi> yikes
[09:06:31] <impi> really?
[09:06:41] <blackspotwiggins> impi, well it's posted on 2008
[09:06:46] <impi> i actually had the jquery ui one but moved away to that one..
[09:06:53] <impi> ag flipstix
[09:07:05] <misterm> sherjilozair: that creates a jQuery object that holds a tr element
[09:07:26] <sherjilozair> excellent.
[09:07:29] <blackspotwiggins> impi, the range selector looks different in UI one tho
[09:07:32] <sherjilozair> Thank you.
[09:08:18] <impi> ag, no worries, ill just have to hack it then :( this date range picker is setup allready and everything..
[09:08:38] <impi> it seems crazy to change to a nother datepicker just becasue Friday+2days dont work
[09:08:44] <blackspotwiggins> well
[09:08:55] <blackspotwiggins> you could create the date objects manually and pass those
[09:08:59] <blackspotwiggins> i think that would work
[09:09:07] <blackspotwiggins> but you are still working with 3year old code
[09:09:12] <blackspotwiggins> good luck getting support for that
[09:09:32] <impi> yeh ill try that,
[09:09:59] <blackspotwiggins> i'd suggest at least upgrading to a bit newer one
[09:10:01] <blackspotwiggins> linked on the top
[09:10:18] <impi>  Date Range Picker using jQuery UI 1.6 and jQuery UI CSS Framework.
[09:10:25] <impi> yea im am using this one..the latest one

[09:19:16] <guy> misterm: you go to the page. and when you hover the tab area a hand-cursor starts following your cursor. click on the video, click again. cursor stops following.
[09:19:25] <misterm> guy: not for me
[09:19:32] <guy> FF5
[09:19:38] <misterm> guy: it keeps following
[09:20:57] <guy> I've just tested it on 3 different computers. all don't work.
[09:21:34] <guy> just to clarify once again. click on the video. it stars playing. click again on the video (it closes) DON'T CLICK anything now and try moving the cursor
[09:22:46] <misterm> guy: thanks, a clear and explicit list of steps to reproduce the problem helps a lot, unfortunately I don't have firefox on this computer so maybe someone else can help you
[09:22:46] <guy> misterm.

[09:23:20] <sadmicrowave> I don't have FF5
[09:23:34] <misterm> guy: what are you using to play the video?
[09:23:37] <sadmicrowave> I can try FF3.6 but thats not the browser your having problems with
[09:23:53] <misterm> guy: sounds like it's some kind of focus-stealing issue or something
[09:24:40] <guy> ps this happens after li.empty(); is triggered
[09:24:46] <guy> which should have no effect on the mousemove
[09:25:31] <misterm> guy, where is that line?
[09:26:06] <sadmicrowave> guy, are you wanting the finger to be directly over the mouse? or replace the mouse? mine shows the finger ~100px below the mouse
[09:26:12] <guy> li.empty();
[09:26:26] <guy> sadmicrowave: that's only while testing.
[09:26:30] <misterm> guy: I mean what file and line is it in?

[09:31:39] <janthony> I'm trying to get sortable() to work properly with .live(), as I need it to work with elements that are being appended to the dom. I tried $(".couponCatsList").sortable('refresh'); - but did not have any luck. Any ideas?
[09:31:54] <soc42> hi #jquery
[09:33:28] <sadmicrowave> janthony, can you just call $('.couponCatsList').sortable() within the same functions that appends the new DOM elements
[09:33:36] <sadmicrowave> soc42, hi
[09:34:20] <janthony> sadmicrowave: So call it every time I append a new element that is sortable?
[09:34:29] <sadmicrowave> yes?
[09:34:37] <sadmicrowave> thats my solution at least
[09:34:45] <sadmicrowave> does it work?
[09:34:46] <janthony> sadmicrowave: I can try, but that seems overkill.
[09:35:00] <sadmicrowave> let me check sortable's docs
[09:35:08] <sadmicrowave> ?sortable @ sadmicrowave
[09:35:09] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable
[09:36:12] <janthony> sadmicrowave: Your solution did work. Only thing is, I wonder if that's overkill.
[09:36:25] <sadmicrowave> yea I'm looking for a better approach
[09:36:40] <janthony> sadmicrowave: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#method-refresh - this is suppose to work, similar to .live() but didn't work for me.
[09:38:22] <OrangeDoorhinge> Hi, when I call .attr or .addClass in IE6,7,8, the values don't seem to get wrapped in quotes. e.g. id=fooID, rather than id="fooID"

[09:40:10] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6682347/mousemove-focus-is-lost-when-dom-modification-is-initiated-on-ff5
[09:40:19] <sadmicrowave> janthony, yea I see that now, hmm. maybe your not implementing it correctly...can you use a jsfiddle and show me how you are implementing the sortable in the first place, then how you append DOM elements, then how you are calling sortable('refresh')
[09:40:39] <janthony> sadmicrowave: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1672182/jquery-sortable-live - this answer is exactly what you said, and is also my case, I"m using for li's.
[09:40:49] <janthony> sadmicrowave: "The refresh method of .sortable() does not seem to recognize li's which are NOT added via the .sortable() functions."
[09:40:50] <alban_> I'm trying to set up a multiple callback method for multople Ajax request but my callback ain't no workin', can someone help ?
[09:40:52] <alban_> See http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/
[09:41:45] <janthony> sadmicrowave: I'll just do your proposed method and call it a day. Thanks! :)
[09:42:00] <alban_> I have the feeling that the $(document).queue() is not started at all
[09:42:07] <sadmicrowave> janthony, no problem

[09:43:47] <alban_> This does call multiple callback functions, but doesn't queue
[09:43:48] <alban_> http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/1/
[09:43:49] <Assimilater> thanks phlp
[09:44:10] <fluffhead> I have two websites.  The root site is on a custom CMS, the other is on Wordpress.  I've connected the login system so that if you're logged into the root site, you're logged into the child site. If not, I'd like to be able to open the root site in an iframe and allow users to login that way.  Is this possible?
[09:45:16] <alban_> ¬ø so no one to help on Jquery Queue cf. http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/ and http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/1/ ?
[09:47:37] <alban_> there's no damn .start()
[09:47:55] <Assimilater> ok i'm wondering if i can use something in jquery core to when a button gets pushed scroll the .contact it was pushed in to the top of the page, and when it gets pushed again scroll back to the initial position http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/4/
[09:52:33] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6682347/mousemove-focus-is-lost-when-dom-modification-is-initiated-on-ff5
[09:52:36] <guy> some help with this please
[09:52:36] <alban_> ok, it's called dequeue()
[09:54:58] <alban_> Damn. Now it's calling the same function twice http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/2/
[10:02:46] <Assimilater> anyone know how i could dynamically scroll a div to the top of the visible screen when a button inside it gets pushed? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/7/
[10:02:55] <jeffsmykil> is there something wrong with this?
[10:02:55] <jeffsmykil>         if ($(".am_pm").attr("background-position").is("0 0")) {
[10:02:55] <jeffsmykil>             alert(yes);
[10:02:56] <jeffsmykil>         }
[10:03:09] <jeffsmykil> sorry forgot it was multiple lines
[10:03:17] <Krambfhase> sooo wrong.
[10:03:21] <Assimilater> (and put the scroll back where it was when it gets pushed again)
[10:03:27] <jeffsmykil> Krambfhase: ok
[10:03:34] <jeffsmykil> it was a guess
[10:03:46] <jeffsmykil> ill use ==
[10:04:04] <Krambfhase> not sure that'll work, but feel free to try
[10:04:14] <erichynds> .is() only takes a DOM element or selector
[10:04:18] <erichynds> use css() instead of attr()
[10:04:20] <Assimilater> jeffsmykil: .attr versus .css?
[10:04:31] <jeffsmykil> that makes more sense
[10:04:35] <Assimilater> jeffsmykil: what he said ^^
[10:04:37] <impi> mmm using datejs i can get 'next friday' which is the next friday, but how do i get the friday after that?
[10:04:37] <Assimilater> lol
[10:04:41] <impi> like next next friday?
[10:05:08] <systemfault> Ask Rebecca Black, she's know.
[10:05:11] <impi> essentially i am looking for next weekend, which is not this weekend, it's the one after that
[10:05:16] <systemfault> Ask Rebecca Black, she knows. :P
[10:05:23] <Assimilater> anyone know how i could dynamically scroll a div to the top of the visible screen when a button inside it gets pushed? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/7/ (and scroll back when the push the button again?)
[10:05:36] <impi> wtf is rebecca black?
[10:05:44] <jeffsmykil> if ($(".am_pm").css("background-position") == "0 0") {
[10:05:44] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, scroll the div or animate the div?
[10:05:49] <Assimilater> systemfault: no please don't bring it up here
[10:05:52] <alban_> mmm. can someone explain what's crappy in my question for not getting any reply ? Is it too obvious or something ?
[10:05:58] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: scroll the div to the top of the visible screen
[10:06:02] <Krambfhase> you missed like this years biggets meme
[10:06:14] <Krambfhase> impi: ^
[10:06:27] <impi> uhm anyone oin my date issue? rebecca wont know ;)
[10:07:04] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, I think your terminology is wrong.. you can make a div with internal scrollable content scroll-to-top but if you are trying to make the div MOVE to the top of the window then you are talking about animating
[10:07:31] <Assimilater> oh
[10:07:36] <Assimilater> i am using the wrong terminology then
[10:07:48] <alban_> wtf is happening : http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/2/
[10:08:46] <blindMoe> alban_: it seems to work for me.. what is not working for you?
[10:09:00] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, in any case... $('#mydiv').animte({top: '0px'},slow); this will make #mydiv scroll to top:0px of its parent element.  So if it's parent is <body> then it will animate to the top of your page
[10:09:09] <soc42> i have an upload form and if a file has been selected, i can't be deleted anymore.
[10:09:20] <Krambfhase> impi: .next() ?
[10:09:20] <soc42> therefore i need to reset this upload with jquery
[10:09:25] <alban_> blindMoe: I get 2 times "alert 2"
[10:09:32] <impi> Krambfhase, tried that one
[10:09:34] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, sorry typo:  $('#mydiv').animate({top: '0px'},slow);
[10:09:52] <alban_> should get _both_ alert1 and alert2
[10:09:56] <Assimilater> so that doesnt' actually scroll the window
[10:09:56] <soc42> but how can i access the input type="field" value-property?
[10:09:58] <Assimilater> it moves the div
[10:10:09] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, correct
[10:10:15] <Assimilater> is there a way to do the former?
[10:10:26] <Assimilater> so that if there is content below it can just be scrolled to?
[10:10:26] <impi> it picks up this friday... :( im looking to get next weekend - which isnt this coming weekend, it's the one after that...like a week in advance..
[10:10:31] <Assimilater> (and above)
[10:11:30] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, include the scrollTo() plugin and call $("window").scrollTo({top: '0px'},500); <- I believe that is the syntax
[10:11:40] <Assimilater> (there's going to be hundreds of the divs you see in the fiddle on my final product also so i'm not sure moving it to the top work)
[10:11:40] <sadmicrowave> ?scrollTo @ Assimilater
[10:11:41] <bot-t> Assimilater, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[10:12:10] <Krambfhase> impi: Date.parse('friday').next().friday()
[10:12:12] <Assimilater> oooh
[10:12:17] <Assimilater> investigate thsi i will
[10:12:39] <Krambfhase> impi: that gives me Fri 25.7
[10:12:51] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, what I just posted will basically simulate the user clicking their mouse on the left-vertical scrollbar and sliding it all the way to the top
[10:13:13] <impi> Krambfhase, ah man, thanks let me test it quick,
[10:13:38] <sadmicrowave> Date.parse('friday').next().next().next().next().friday() ;P
[10:13:45] <impi> if you're in cape town south africa, we could go for beer - i owe you a couple if this works
[10:14:33] <Assimilater> sadmicrowave: are you familiar with this plugin enough to know if it can tell you the current window's scroll position (and thus save me a bit of reading? :P )
[10:14:58] <sadmicrowave> I think there is another plugin for that....
[10:15:03] <sadmicrowave> ?scrollTop
[10:15:03] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[10:15:12] <sadmicrowave> ?scrollLeft
[10:15:12] <bot-t> .scrollLeft(): Get the current horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[10:15:28] <sadmicrowave> Assimilater, there you go
[10:15:54] <Assimilater> ah thanks
[10:17:15] <sadmicrowave> yea, theres like a function for everything
[10:17:47] <Krambfhase> Not cape town no. Hows the beer there?
[10:17:54] <sadmicrowave> warm?
[10:18:06] <sadmicrowave> like red stripe?
[10:19:25] <Krambfhase> blue streak?
[10:23:43] <sadmicrowave> Fosters?
[10:26:11] <soc42> how about this approach to clear the input field?
[10:26:12] <soc42> http://jsfiddle.net/YJKL5/
[10:26:20] <soc42> can anyone please have a look?
[10:27:00] <soc42> the problem is, that after selecting a file for the input field type=file the field can not be cleared by the user anymore
[10:27:16] <soc42> now there should be a link to remove the selected file by jquery
[10:27:49] <soc42> sadmicrowave: do you know what's wrong in my approach?
[10:27:55] <phlp> alban_: http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/4
[10:28:17] <sadmicrowave> I"m looking now, first off, you don't need to include 'event' in the click callback if you arn't going to use it...
[10:28:23] <chromakode> is it possible to do a capturing event listener with jQuery bind()?
[10:29:32] <soc42> sadmicrowave: k, i updated it to this http://jsfiddle.net/YJKL5/1/
[10:29:36] <sadmicrowave> soc42, secondly you don't need to do e.preventDefault(); unless you are clicking a link or something and you don't want the default event to execute.

[10:30:20] <sadmicrowave> http://jsfiddle.net/YJKL5/2/
[10:30:20] <soc42> k, so i better change the clearUpload-DIV to a <A>-tag?

[10:30:51] <alban_> phlp: s/and I understand why that bind and I don't even understand why that bind /

[10:31:23] <Krambfhase> some body set us up the troll!
[10:31:26] <alban_> phlp: why is the bind required ?
[10:31:36] <sadmicrowave> no joke
[10:31:43] <alban_>  /ignored
[10:31:45] <tmayr> soc42: http://jsfiddle.net/YJKL5/3/
[10:31:58] <sadmicrowave> soc42, we good now?
[10:32:33] <tmayr> oh sadmicrowave is cleaner and it works, :p
[10:32:41] <soc42> yes, better than that!
[10:32:48] <sadmicrowave> :)
[10:32:51] <soc42> thank you both tmayr and sadmicrowave
[10:32:56] <sadmicrowave> np
[10:33:14] <drd> chromakode: i've never heard of any support for capturing in jquery
[10:33:19] <drd> (hi)
[10:33:20] <soc42> so in this case better use the .val('') that the .attr()
[10:33:30] <sadmicrowave> soc42, do you understand what I was talking about with the e.preventDefault() usage?
[10:33:40] <chromakode> drd, yeah. looks like jQuery only bubbles in its synthetic events system, and you can't tell it to capture if you want to (grepped the source)
[10:34:07] <sadmicrowave> soc42, right, .val() is the same thing as .attr('val'); but its a pre-existing function and you might as well make use of it
[10:34:47] <impi> Krambfhase, you were right actually, sadmicrowave too, i got the next friday after this one with : Date.parse('friday').next().next().friday();
[10:35:15] <soc42> sadmicrowave: yes, i understand... the e.preventDefault is used e.g. to prevent something like a <A href="#"> meaning: prevent the default action of the tag
[10:35:26] <sadmicrowave> if you wanted to do it with pure javascript you could do this: document.getElementById('uploadField').value = "";
[10:35:26] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:35:33] <impi> thanks for the hint. im trying to get the sunday after that though and i am at function(){ return Date.parse('next sunday').next().next().next().next();  } but it always stuck on the 17th..?
[10:35:47] <sadmicrowave> impi, lol thats crazy, I just made that up
[10:36:11] <sadmicrowave> it was more intended as a joke than anything
[10:36:17] <phlp> alban_: it's a scope issue. the funcs will use the last value of i. if you look at i inside the func they are both 1 which is why the second func is called twice. you can also use a closure http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/6
[10:36:21] <impi> sadmicrowave, lol i was laughing hey...it was funny typing it here, but i am wondering at which point will this code come back to byte me in the ass
[10:36:40] <sadmicrowave> lol, oh well, deal with it when it happens
[10:36:46] <impi> true
[10:37:15] <sadmicrowave> impi, I'm kidding, thats a terrible ideology
[10:37:42] <alban_> phlp: and .each avoids that scope issue ?
[10:37:50] <impi> yea i know, but dont worry it's my own site, so i wont be able to sleep until this is working...every click, every pixel will be and do what i tell it to
[10:38:23] <sadmicrowave> good, I wouldn't worry too much about it coming back to bite you, it seems like pretty sound logic
[10:38:38] <drd> chromakode: i've been reading the jq ajax code for the last few weeks ;) haven't looked at the events code enough to tell if its something you could hack in easily
[10:38:57] <chromakode> drd, thanks, but I think it's just a case where I'll use addEventListener :)
[10:39:30] <sadmicrowave> ?addEventListener @ sadmicrowave
[10:39:33] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, addEventListener | jQuery Plugins - I foudn myself writing $.proxy too many times when ever I wanted to bind an event, so I wrote this very very short plugin to do the work for me: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/addEventListener
[10:40:04] <phlp> alban_: each is basically a closure there. each iteration is a separate function with its own scope
[10:40:18] <sadmicrowave> ++phlp
[10:40:44] <alban_> mmm I really have to dig some javascript root concepts a bit more apparently
[10:41:14] <sadmicrowave> alban_, what don't you understand about it? maybe we can clear it up
[10:41:48] <alban_> btw here's an OKish version : http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/7/
[10:43:22] <impi> got ya!
[10:43:42] <alban_> sadmicrowave: that would be a wise thing. let me have a look at the code phlp produced
[10:43:56] <impi> to get the next weekend after this one, and the sunday as my end date, i end up using this : function(){ return Date.parse('friday').next().next().friday().add(2).day(); }
[10:45:35] <sadmicrowave> ?friday() @ sadmicrowave
[10:45:37] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Friday, 2011-07-01 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery-meeting_20110701.log.html
[10:45:45] <sadmicrowave> lol
[10:45:55] <sadmicrowave> didn't think that would work
[10:46:52] <soc42> could it be a problem for jquery if i put the js statement within a <script>-tag anywhere in the body of the page where the link should fire?
[10:47:23] <soc42> because if i put some of the suggestions back in my page, the link does not fire a all?
[10:47:29] <soc42> +t
[10:47:34] <sadmicrowave> soc42, as long as you include your function in a $(document).ready(function(){ }); I don't think there is an issue
[10:48:42] <sadmicrowave> I haven't experimented very much with putting js within html though, I always just use an external script link file
[10:49:22] <soc42> you're absolutely right. the document.ready-function is a must in my situation!
[10:49:33] <alban_> ok, so in fact the value of the iterator was kept and the same function was added twice
[10:49:34] <soc42> sadmicrowave++
[10:49:40] <soc42> thumbs up!
[10:49:47] <draginx> If I have an array like "weapon[0] = [0,1,2,3,4];" w/e and I have a var selects = {weapon: 0}; and I do a for (var key in selects) {} how can I make "key" select from the "weapon" variable?
[10:50:35] <dabear> draginx: don't
[10:51:13] <alban_> but I have to admit that the use of this and .bind(i) in http://jsfiddle.net/BSzJk/4/ , that really blows my mind phlp
[10:51:30] <sadmicrowave> draginx, can't you just do for( var key in weapon ) {} ?
[10:51:34] <dabear> use var stuff = { weapon: [0,1,2,3,4] };  for (var key in selects) { stuff[key] here}
[10:51:47] <draginx> sadmicrowave: "weapon" is pretty mucvh dynamic
[10:51:58] <dabear> dont have dynamic variables
[10:52:10] <dabear> do only have dynamic objects
[10:52:15] <draginx> O_o
[10:52:31] <sadmicrowave> agreed
[10:52:33] <dabear> contents of objects*
[10:52:45] <Xeon06_> I'm attaching a keypress event to an input text, and when the event is fired, if I check the value of the input with .val, it seems to be one step "late", as if the event was fired before modifying the input. Any way to get the actual value?

[10:54:29] <sadmicrowave> lol
[10:54:48] <sadmicrowave> I like that one
[10:54:50] <joris> no need for that
[10:55:02] <joris> Xeon06_: Use onKeyUp instead of onKeyPress
[10:55:44] <Xeon06_> joris: Thanks, should have thought of that
[10:57:44] <fuchstronaut> is it just me or is firefox caching just retarded?
[10:59:36] <sadmicrowave> joris, do you know how to capture the keycode value of peripheral keys (like arrow keys)? I use keypress() but that gives a js warning stating: 'the charCode property of keydown event should not be used...'
[11:00:07] <sadmicrowave> joris, then I try using keydown() or keyup() and neither of those get the keycodes of my peripheral keys
[11:00:31] <joris> use event.keyCode
[11:01:19] <phlp> alban_: sorry was away. the bind isnt that crazy it just lets you set 'this' in a function to whatever you want. not the same bind as jquery https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[11:01:32] <sadmicrowave> joris, It's not accessing the value that is the problem, it's the js warning I get when using the functions
[11:02:08] <joris> its just that charCode is obsolete I think
[11:02:20] <alban_> awwww... Now that's... explaining why I was getting confused
[11:02:39] <sadmicrowave> joris, I think it is too but it's finding charCode from the js core file, not anything I'm putting in my function...
[11:02:41] <alban_> so bind is a form of closure too
[11:02:48] <joris> ah
[11:02:56] <joris> well, it's just a warning. not an error.
[11:03:02] <joris> your users will never be bothered with it
[11:03:24] <alban_> and basically, I thought for( var i in A )  was a closure too
[11:03:25] <sadmicrowave> lol, yea which is why I havn't addressed it...but it is irritating to have this warning fill up my console
[11:03:47] <joris> don't use firefox then
[11:03:52] <joris> firefox sucks anyway
[11:03:55] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[11:03:57] <sadmicrowave> lies
[11:04:07] <joris> slow, old mammoth of a browser
[11:04:12] <sadmicrowave> and your alternative would be?... IE?
[11:04:17] <joris> the dev stuff in WebKit is gold
[11:04:22] <joris> Chrome/Safari
[11:04:41] <lanmower> can anyone give me a good reason to not use livequery?
[11:04:58] * rummik agrees with joris 
[11:05:04] <sadmicrowave> I use what my end users use ( since my pages are for internal company use only )
[11:05:19] <joris> sadmicrowave: there's a differnce between development and testing
[11:05:29] <joris> sadmicrowave: surely you don't use the console for end user testing
[11:05:35] <joris> Firefox's console sucks
[11:05:57] <joris> Moz has had its day imho
[11:06:27] <sadmicrowave> joris, true, and I recognize the difference, but killing two birds with 1 stone is what I'm trying to achieve, so I develop and test at the same time...
[11:06:34] <snover> lanmower: it‚Äôs slow, it has not been updated since forever, its most useful features were put into jquery core in 1.4
[11:06:57] <lanmower> snover, is it really slow? I find it quite speedy...
[11:06:58] <snover> the features that weren‚Äôt put into jquery core don‚Äôt work for half of the dom manipulation methods
[11:07:07] <snover> lanmower: it performs a polling loop.
[11:07:55] <lanmower> snover can you give me a list of dom methods it doesnt work with?
[11:08:15] <snover> many of them.
[11:08:16] <sadmicrowave> snover, are we talking about livequery or live()?
[11:08:21] <snover> livequery.
[11:08:25] <snover> look at the list of functions it overrides
[11:08:26] <lanmower> I'm talking about livequery.
[11:08:31] <snover> and then look at the list of actual dom manipulation functions.
[11:08:33] <lanmower> yeah I'm looking at them...
[11:08:39] <snover> and notice how one list is much shorter than the other
[11:08:43] <lanmower> cant I just add the new ones to the list?
[11:08:48] <snover> again
[11:08:58] <snover> it‚Äôs slow
[11:08:59] <snover> don‚Äôt do it.
[11:09:14] <orentanay> I'm trying to use replaceWith on a collection to replace multiple items with only a single item, but what I get is the replacement item repeated for each of the items in my collection. Any suggestions? thank you.
[11:09:15] <lanmower> how slow? I've been using it quite heavily...

[11:09:45] <snover> potentially orders of magnitude.
[11:09:57] <snover> it is invoked every time a change happens whether or not you need it to
[11:10:10] <lanmower> what if I need it on every change?
[11:10:16] <snover> then you are doing something wrong.
[11:10:17] <snover> :
[11:10:17] <snover> :)
[11:10:27] <lanmower> not neccesarily...
[11:11:29] <lanmower> I dont see the 'wrong' in this.
[11:11:40] <lanmower> excuse my ignorance...
[11:11:46] <sadmicrowave> orentanay, http://jsfiddle.net/W72pR/
[11:11:57] <phlp> you asked for his opinion why argue it?
[11:12:29] <lanmower> I'm trying to make heads and tails of this...
[11:13:18] <snover> I‚Äôm telling you as someone that has used livequery, seen it abused, and knows better, that it basically guarantees that your code will be slower and shittier than if you just used $.fn.delegate and performed any necessary initialisation inside your callbacks.
[11:13:23] <lanmower> so when implemented in jquery, these functions got rewritten without the need for a polling loop?
[11:13:27] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:13:46] <lenswipe> im doing custom checkboxes with jquery and javascript and my function is being run twice for some reason
[11:13:49] <lenswipe> can someone help?
[11:13:57] <tbranyen> hmmm the jQuery.fn.html function is causing some sheeeeit for me, removing the forward slashes from image sources

[11:14:12] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, give me time
[11:14:16] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/NYi1V0FW thats my function
[11:14:29] <lanmower> so the initialisation itself, theres a better way to perform it?
[11:14:32] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/EGnhVARJ
[11:14:36] <lenswipe> thats me using the function
[11:14:38] <lenswipe> can someone help
[11:15:31] <lanmower> I want to perform arbitrary functions on newly added based on selectors... is it better then to give them the once over after the ajax calls manually?
[11:15:48] <lanmower> er, newly added elements that is.
[11:16:23] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, for 1: if you call $(document).ready before your checkbox function then you don't have to call it twice
[11:16:51] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, and two, I don't see an issue with this function so there must be something else causing the duplication
[11:17:39] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, http://pastebin.com/xQxk3xC0
[11:17:43] <lenswipe> is that better?
[11:18:08] <sadmicrowave> umm, no
[11:18:12] <lenswipe> ??
[11:19:05] <kurund> what's the best wast to get cursor position in a textarea? any plugins etc ?

[11:20:02] <lanmower> sadmicrowave: so I just run selectors over my html with the find function then and run functions on it, after my ajax calls?
[11:20:03] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, my function isnt being run now :(
[11:20:18] <kurund> I want to insert a text at cursor position in textarea, it fails in IE 8 because it does not support selectionStart
[11:20:22] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, apparently "checkbox is not defined"
[11:20:30] <lenswipe> ...which is strange seeing as ive just damn well defined it
[11:20:34] * lenswipe spanks javascript
[11:20:36] <lenswipe> >:/
[11:20:53] <kurund> Krambfhase: checking ..
[11:20:56] <kurund> thanks
[11:21:20] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, did you include the script file link above or below your file link that includes this function?
[11:21:28] <Krambfhase> :)
[11:21:36] <lenswipe> i put what you had there in <head> which is where it was before
[11:21:52] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, can you make a pastebin of your entire <head> tag
[11:21:59] <lenswipe> sure
[11:22:18] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, http://pastebin.com/nfZJsNXe
[11:22:22] <kurund> Krambfhase: are you aware of any plugins that will meet my requirements, or anything to replace selectStart and selectEnd property ?
[11:23:35] <Krambfhase> sorry, jCaret is the only one i know.
[11:23:58] <phlp> lenswipe: you can define the function outside of $(document).ready just make sure you call it inside
[11:24:25] <sadmicrowave> phlp, thanks I was looking for a way to state that, not feeling very articulate today
[11:24:40] <orentanay> how would I replace a collection of td's with just a single td? I've tried replaceWith, but that replaces each of the tds in my collection w/ the replacement td, so I'm sort of back where I started. Any suggestions? thanks.
[11:25:02] <lenswipe> phlp, it seems to only work outside of the $(document).ready
[11:25:03] <sadmicrowave> orentanay, I posted a solution to this problem earlier, did it not work?
[11:25:32] <sadmicrowave> orentanay, http://jsfiddle.net/W72pR/
[11:25:37] <orentanay> sorry, I probably missed it surfing for a solution. reading back now.
[11:25:46] <orentanay> thanks for the help
[11:26:31] <sadmicrowave> soc42, basically, you are replacing the first occurrence, then removing all the other occurrences
[11:26:47] <sadmicrowave> damnit, so*
[11:27:16] <lenswipe> phlp, any ideas on that?
[11:28:25] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, hes saying you don't have to put the function within $(document).ready, just as long as you call it with onclick=checkbox('mydiv') within document.ready...
[11:28:40] <soc42> well it's working fine now, thanksalot!
[11:28:57] <sadmicrowave> which you are by default if you are calling it from your html...
[11:29:09] <sadmicrowave> soc42, sorry I did'nt mean to type your name, I was trying to type "so"
[11:29:12] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, i dont get how i do that
[11:29:29] <sadmicrowave> just take the document.ready stuff out completely
[11:29:38] <lenswipe> out of where?
[11:30:20] <sadmicrowave> here http://pastebin.com/vaGV5hD3
[11:30:49] <soc42> no prob, you're always welcome!
[11:32:24] <sadmicrowave> orentanay, did that solve your problem?
[11:33:38] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, so basically we are back where we started at, just a little further because we know that the duplication problem is not being caused by the script you posted...something else is causing it
[11:34:09] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, im really confused :(
[11:34:35] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, http://pastebin.com/k3thaUDs

[11:35:56] <Krambfhase> lenswipe: you do know .toggleClass() right?
[11:36:15] <lenswipe> no
[11:40:22] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, is that not working for you?
[11:40:28] <sadmicrowave> ?toggleClass @ lenswipe
[11:40:28] <bot-t> lenswipe, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[11:40:37] <mythmon> how can I prevent a child element being clicked from triggering it's parent's click event?
[11:42:00] <mythmon> in particular i have a checkbox inside an element. I want to click on the element, but i also want to be able to toggle the checkbox without triggering the click event
[11:42:18] <lenswipe> im having issues with toggleClass too
[11:43:15] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, Krambfhase http://pastebin.com/XUEgLtm7 i have that under the checkboxes in my html
[11:44:50] <Krambfhase> that only triggers when you click the label, not the checkbox.
[11:46:00] <lenswipe> Krambfhase, thats what im doing
[11:46:03] <lenswipe> and its not triggering
[11:46:44] <lenswipe> whoah
[11:46:52] <lenswipe> its triggering when i click the checkbox not the label
[11:46:54] <lenswipe> WTF?!
[11:47:55] <sadmicrowave> lol
[11:48:03] <lenswipe> srsly WTF!?
[11:48:07] <sadmicrowave> mythmon, I'm working on your problem
[11:51:02] <mythmon> sadmicrowave: i figured it out.
[11:51:09] <sadmicrowave> what did you do?
[11:51:22] <DroMastaP`Fr> Hello everybody !
[11:51:37] <mythmon> the checkbox inside binds to a click event(e) and then calls e.stopPropagation()
[11:51:45] <mythmon> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[11:51:59] <sadmicrowave> nicetry, I was looking in the e event but hadn't found anything yet
[11:52:16] <sadmicrowave> nice*
[11:52:38] <DroMastaP`Fr> I have a question, how to create a function but without running it ? Just give her a name, and run it if I need, can you help me ? I know, it's a noob question :)
[11:52:40] <mythmon> google is my friend :)
[11:52:47] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[11:53:45] <sadmicrowave> DroMastaP`Fr, Just make it with function MyFunction(){ //do something }; then call it later if you want with MyFunction();
[11:55:10] <Krambfhase> lower case myFunction, please!
[11:55:31] <sadmicrowave> personal preference

[12:04:13] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, it does it on chrome on windows too
[12:04:31] <lenswipe> sadmicrowave, im wondering if it would be better to test for the box being checked and apply the style on that basis
[12:04:34] <Krambfhase> i am working on that, lenswipe.
[12:04:44] <lenswipe> Krambfhase, are you a jquery developer?

[12:08:21] <lenswipe> nope
[12:09:11] <Xeon06_> Is there a better way to limit ajax queries to 1, and only the latest, to query whenever a letter is entered in an input box? This is what I'm doing: http://pastebin.com/UNva9JrK
[12:09:17] <RwL> no responses on #jquerymobile or #jquerymobile-dev, so thought I'd ask here: are there source files (Photoshop, or whatever) available for the jQM icons besides the optimized PNGs in the themes dir? Would like to customize without reproducing the entire sprite sheet.
[12:09:21] <sadmicrowave> Krambfhase, when would e.target not equal this ?
[12:09:44] <Krambfhase> in the case it bubbled up. ie. the checkbox was clicked
[12:10:25] <sadmicrowave> oh yea, when the propagation takes place
[12:10:28] <sadmicrowave> duh
[12:11:52] <sadmicrowave> lenswipe, does Krambfhase's solution work?
[12:12:38] <lenswipe> :O
[12:12:40] <lenswipe> yes it does! :D
[12:12:48] <lenswipe> Krambfhase, thank you thank you thank you :D
[12:13:00] <Krambfhase> no, it doesnt
[12:13:06] <Krambfhase> klick the checkbox itself.
[12:13:06] <lenswipe> yes it does
[12:13:13] <lenswipe> right but the checkbox is gonna be hidden
[12:13:26] <versatiletech> Xeon06_: You can use a timeout function to only make an ajax request x seconds or milliseconds after the last key typed. Each time a key is pressed it would reset the timeout if it's under a certain amount of time between each key.
[12:13:29] <Krambfhase> ok.
[12:14:04] <lenswipe> Krambfhase, or would it be better to detect wether or not the checkbox is checked and do it that way?
[12:14:40] <Krambfhase> dunno
[12:14:54] <sadmicrowave> all this trouble and you arnt even going to use the checkboxes, you could just add a custom attribute to the label stating clicked or not and call it a day
[12:15:30] <Xeon06_> versatiletech: I still have to abort some previous requests which may by some chance take longer than the most recent one to complete, thus returning a false positive
[12:28:07] <sherjilozair> hey guys, I'm using an animation, but can't do it properly.
[12:28:20] <sherjilozair> I'm using html to put html in an element
[12:28:29] <sherjilozair> and I want that event to be fadedIn
[12:29:06] <sherjilozair> but I guess the problem is by the time the element is being animated, the JS code has already progressed to another part of the code.
[12:29:20] <sherjilozair> Which is interfering with the animation.
[12:29:40] <sherjilozair> I've already weitten all the code, and don't want to put all of it in a callback function.
[12:29:40] <soc42> hey sadmicrowave: cu next time, and again thanks for your help!
[12:29:50] <sherjilozair> Is there a better method ?
[12:31:19] <uf0> guys how can i put the http proxy on a server i'm connecting via SSH terminal
[12:31:20] <ajpiano> callbacks are how you deal with asynchronous behaviour
[12:31:27] <uf0> i was able to put all the server info in ssh config
[12:31:36] <uf0> but not sure how I can put the http proxy info
[12:31:55] <ajpiano> sherjilozair, there is really not a better solution than refactoring your code to use the callbacks
[12:31:59] <uf0> sup ajpiano :)
[12:32:03] <ajpiano> there are probably worse solutions
[12:32:06] <ajpiano> hi uf0
[12:32:21] <ajpiano> you kind of have to stay on topic and not use this as general web help though ok
[12:32:23] <ajpiano> :)
[12:32:37] <uf0> ok
[12:33:10] <uf0> i was able to setup multiple servers via ssh perfect
[12:33:16] <uf0> it's just some require http proxies
[12:33:30] <uf0> not sure what to do on those via config/ssh
[12:33:32] <kukosk> hi all ‚Ä¶ i have a table (newest jquery) and when i do ‚Ä¶ table.find('tr').css('height'); it tells me 13px, but it's actually 14 px ‚Ä¶ because i see it in the firebug‚Ä¶. style="height: 14px.....
[12:33:36] <uf0> is mainly my question
[12:33:43] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: But that's messing up my namespace, I have an element 'obj' that I want to put in the callback function, as I want to use it later.
[12:34:03] <ajpiano> there are plenty of ways to have access to that object later
[12:34:23] <ajpiano> not the least of which is see $.proxy
[12:34:47] <ajpiano> $.proxy
[12:34:56] <ajpiano> ?proxy
[12:34:56] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:35:30] <sadmicrowave> soc42, no problem
[12:36:12] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: It looks too complicated. I can't understand it.
[12:36:38] <kukosk> hi all ‚Ä¶ i have a table (newest jquery) and when i do ‚Ä¶ table.find('tr').css('height'); it tells me 13px, but it's actually 14 px ‚Ä¶ because i see it in the firebug‚Ä¶. style="height: 14px.....
[12:37:11] <ajpiano> sherjilozair: i read this in a book today
[12:37:22] <ajpiano> "Things you don't do are difficult and things you've done are easy. So you don't try. And I think that's a mistake"
[12:37:29] <Krambfhase> ?p @ kukosk
[12:37:29] <sadmicrowave> kukosk, maybe the 14px is including part of a 1px border that you have?
[12:37:29] <bot-t> kukosk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:37:37] <shesek> kukosk, the height contains more than the CSS property
[12:37:46] <shesek> kukosk, stuff like paddings and borders
[12:37:51] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: :)
[12:37:51] <ajpiano> callbacks are how asynchronous apps in js work, you have to delve in and figure it out
[12:37:53] <shesek> kukosk, try .height() instead
[12:38:00] <ajpiano> and no time like the present
[12:38:18] <ajpiano> sherjilozair http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-7
[12:38:20] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: well said.
[12:38:35] <kukosk> shesek: i tried also that one ...
[12:38:47] <kukosk> shesek: can i actually get the number in style ? somehow ?
[12:39:00] <kukosk> parst attr('style') somehow ?
[12:39:26] <Jayflux> hey ajpiano not seen u around for a while
[12:39:26] <shesek> kukosk, I think css() works with the computed style. Try .get(0).style.height, maybe
[12:39:36] <shesek> or attr('style').height
[12:40:38] <kukosk> shesek: attr('style').height doesnt work
[12:40:44] <ajpiano> i'm a busy guy
[12:40:56] <Fernandos> hehe ajpiano your avatar looks as if you played the main role in SAW.. at least at that tiny size :P
[12:41:13] <ajpiano> lol, i did no such thing!
[12:41:45] <shesek> kukosk, jsfiddle
[12:41:50] <ajpiano> i haven't even seen any of those
[12:41:53] <hExDj> how can I check that at least one button from a radio group is checked? by default none are
[12:41:55] <runa> heyas. I'm looking for a plugin to graph some values (optimally using Google Chart API); I found jQuery.gchart but it's generating images and I want a "interactive" graph (where the user can mouseover a point and will know the point value). Any suggestions?
[12:41:59] <shesek> kukosk, it is inline style, right?
[12:42:18] <kukosk> shesek: yes it is ‚Ä¶ i want to get the height that is written in style="" ...
[12:42:32] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: so by your method of proxies, I should proxify a function such that the `this` will refer to the `obj` I want transported to the callback function ?
[12:43:03] <ajpiano> yes
[12:43:05] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: and use that proxified function as the callback funciton in the animation ?
[12:43:13] <sherjilozair> I see.
[12:43:15] <ajpiano> yep
[12:43:21] <ajpiano> but there are defintiely other ways to do it
[12:43:31] <sherjilozair> could you tell me a neater method ?
[12:43:46] <sherjilozair> I want something procedural.
[12:43:52] <ajpiano> inevitably you're still having to break the functionality into smaller... functions
[12:44:01] <ajpiano> there is no procedural approach
[12:44:42] <ajpiano> you could use private functions inside of the function to shufle the data around before and after the async events
[12:44:45] <sherjilozair> why is JQuery not written like that ?! It should only go to the next line, when the previous line is finished.
[12:44:50] <notjrbauer> does anyone have a recommendation for an image slider to use
[12:44:57] <ajpiano> that's not how javascript works sherjilozair
[12:45:09] <ScottO_> how would i get the focus status of a field?
[12:45:23] <sherjilozair> yeah, i know.
[12:45:26] <ScottO_> preferably a boolean
[12:46:26] <hExDj> how can I check that at least one radio button from a group is checked? I need that by default none are
[12:46:30] <sherjilozair> maybe this style is better. I'll backup and start refracting using proxy.
[12:46:40] <ajpiano> you don't have to use proxy to do it
[12:47:15] <phlp> hExDj: .is(':checked')
[12:47:19] <ajpiano> like i said, you just need to break the functions apart so that you can call a discrete function to handle "after the animation" after the animation and it still have access to whatever objects you need by virtue of how you scoped it
[12:47:24] <RoosterJuice> anyone here use wijmo?
[12:47:36] <ajpiano> but there is no "process one line after the other no matter what" way of doing this
[12:47:59] <hExDj> phlp: ah thanks!
[12:48:01] <sherjilozair> ajpiano: I see.
[12:48:22] <sherjilozair> functional programming !
[12:48:28] <sherjilozair> thanks !
[12:48:42] <ajpiano> sherjilozair: :)
[12:52:17] <notjrbauer> Any good carousels to use that arent too hefty? :-[
[12:52:47] <tbranyen> notjrbauer: jquery cycle lite
[12:52:57] <preinheimer> Is there an appropriate place to look for someone willing to do jquery work?
[12:53:09] <tbranyen> preinheimer: you can ask in here, just don't pester i'd say
[12:53:10] <notjrbauer> thanks tbrayen
[12:53:28] <tbranyen> preinheimer: twitter is also a good spot
[12:53:33] <preinheimer> tbranyen: thanks. I'll make sure I've got my question framed well.
[12:53:34] <tbranyen> with a #jquery hashtag
[12:54:19] <keystr0k> How do I replace ".mydiv" with an element that was passed to the custom function ($this):   $('.mydiv ul li:first-child').attr('id');
[12:54:27] <cocoadaemon> Gah. My queue thing doesn't work with 2 Ajax requests :/
[12:54:34] <keystr0k> I cannot figure out the syntax...
[12:54:45] <cocoadaemon> the 2nd one doesn't even fire.
[12:55:16] <kurisu> hi guys, I'm working on a wordpress ajax/jquery public media library plugin... I have created an php and ajax/js function that returns data as expected when logged in as an admin but returns '-1' when not... I have an if( is_admin()) { add_action('wp_ajax_some_function','some_function'); } else { add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_some_action', 'some_action'); } .... im calling the same function so I really can't figure out why I 
[12:56:52] <Snugug> In jQuery.mobile, on line 49, I'm getting an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_trigger' of undefined.
[12:59:23] <ch3mical> yo
[13:01:36] <lanmower> is there a faster way then html() to replace an elements contents in jquery? I already have a jquery node I want to replace the contents with...
[13:01:42] <lanmower> should I use empty and append?
[13:01:55] <gnarf> lanmower: .html( value ) === .empty().append( value )
[13:02:08] <mvgcf> Hey Guys!
[13:02:36] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L232
[13:02:39] <gnarf> @lanmower
[13:02:40] <notjrbauer> snugug I remember getting that error before too :\
[13:02:50] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Do you remember how to fix it?
[13:02:57] <Snugug> Because it's breaking JS later on
[13:03:04] <norm2782> hi all. draggable is misbehaving for me.. when I drag and scroll the screen, the draggable item shoots away from my cursor and disappears outside the screen. known problem/fix?
[13:03:11] <notjrbauer> no I just went back to regular jquery
[13:03:12] <gnarf> so, if you want to avoid a function call and a few ifs, use .empty().append( value ) -- if you want to avoid a few bytes in your JS use .html( value )
[13:03:13] <keystr0k> nm. got it.
[13:03:20] <notjrbauer> are you using both jquery and jquery mobile?
[13:03:33] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Yes. I need jqm for the touch events
[13:03:46] <notjrbauer> what if you just use .click
[13:03:57] <Snugug> notjrbauer: I need the swipes
[13:04:08] <notjrbauer> let me find the swipe pluggin i used
[13:04:13] <Snugug> notjrbauer: ok
[13:04:14] <Snugug> thanks
[13:04:27] <lanmower> gnarf I was just wondering if I already have a jquery node, if it wouldnt be better not to call .html() to get it and then .html on the other one to set it
[13:05:08] <lanmower> I guest its empty and append
[13:05:22] <notjrbauer> snugug
[13:05:24] <notjrbauer> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/swipe
[13:06:07] <mvgcf> Im new to jQuery and don't know anything about Javascript neither.
[13:06:07] <mvgcf> Might anyone explain to me what "var" and "thisTarget" are made for in this line:
[13:06:07] <mvgcf> var thisTarget = $(this).attr('href');
[13:06:07] <mvgcf> Or any link at hand where i can look it up?
[13:06:07] <lanmower> yeah works like a charm.
[13:06:07] <gnarf> lanmower: :)
[13:06:30] <notjrbauer> for a gallery i would do something like $(".galleryContianer").swipe({data:".galleryContainer", swipeLeft....
[13:06:39] <gnarf> dont .html( othernode.html() )
[13:06:43] <gnarf> just .html( othernode )
[13:06:52] <notjrbauer> and do a function triggerRightButton(){$(".prev
[13:06:55] <notjrbauer> kinda of thing
[13:06:57] <Snugug> notjrbauer: thanks, let me take a look
[13:07:08] <gnarf> thats equiv to .empty().append( othernode )
[13:07:17] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Does this support Android as well?
[13:07:31] <Xeon06_> Does anyone see something wrong with this code whatsoever? http://pastebin.com/5YmTMyHp
[13:07:51] <Xeon06_> I get an unexpected end of input error. If I uncomment the commented line, everything is fine
[13:08:05] <notjrbauer> Snugug - yes it does
[13:08:16] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Groovy, let me look
[13:08:36] <notjrbauer> just make sure the data: xxxx is the area you want to have the swipes on
[13:08:36] <necromancer> Xeon06_: yeah, are you kidding?
[13:08:45] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Will do
[13:08:51] <necromancer> Xeon06_: you need {} around that if statement
[13:09:00] <notjrbauer> Snugug are you using a gallery by chance?
[13:09:14] <Snugug> notjrbauer: I'm just jquery.cycle
[13:09:17] <Xeon06_> necromancer: .. what?
[13:09:27] <necromancer> Xeon06_: that syntax isn't supported in all browsers. if (valid) validateNotTaken($(this), 'username');
[13:09:29] <Hory> how is the correct way to access the object that a method is bound to, when that method is used as an event handler? Simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/kRaRM/5/
[13:09:36] <necromancer> Xeon06_: should be if (valid) { validateNotTaken($(this), 'username'); }
[13:09:41] <notjrbauer> alright, ive been using jcarousellite and it gets messy when I loop
[13:09:45] <Xeon06_> necromancer: Ok, but this is commented.
[13:09:48] <notjrbauer> can you set a start in cycle?
[13:10:00] <necromancer> oh is ee
[13:10:06] <necromancer> oh when you uncomment it everything works
[13:10:08] <Snugug> notjrbauer: A first slide? Yah
[13:10:12] <Snugug> it's dead simple to set up
[13:10:22] <notjrbauer> okay this isnt the lite version is it
[13:10:22] <Xeon06_> necromancer: Yeah
[13:10:36] <necromancer> try storing /^([a-z]|[A-Z])([a-z]|[A-Z]|\-)+([a-z]|[A-Z])$/ in a separate var (call it regex or something)
[13:10:43] <necromancer> and then do var valid = regex.test...
[13:10:52] <necromancer> actually i'd call it rx
[13:11:16] <necromancer> also you don't wanna do this: setValidationState($(this), valid ? validationStates.ok : validationStates.error);
[13:11:18] <Xeon06_> necromancer: Still getting an unexpected end of input
[13:11:27] <necromancer> Xeon06_: you want that ternary statement in another var
[13:11:37] <necromancer> or maybe if you put parenthesis around it
[13:11:55] <necromancer> that whole thing is really hard to read though Xeon06_...
[13:12:08] <Xeon06_> necromancer: Still doesn't change a thing
[13:12:27] <Xeon06_> Maybe, but that doesn't really explain the error
[13:12:39] <necromancer> it kinda does
[13:12:44] <necromancer> because you're asking us to figure it out
[13:12:55] <necromancer> i have a feeling that if it was more conventionally written, it would be easier to figure out
[13:13:27] <misterm> Hory: a couple things: 1) since you are just calling MyApp as a function, "this" inside MyApp is the global scope
[13:13:32] <Xeon06_> So basically the ternaries and the regex and the ifs?
[13:13:50] <Snugug> notjrbauer: This works very well, and goes over the first/last threshold. Thanks a lot!
[13:13:52] <necromancer> Xeon06_: lol i know it doesn't narrow it down...do you think you could jsfiddle it so i could play with it?
[13:14:01] <necromancer> (not sure how deep your code goes there)
[13:14:10] <misterm> Hory: What you would do is either store a reference to this inside MyApp, something like var that = this; and then inside increaseCount use that.count instead of this.count
[13:14:11] <Xeon06_> necromancer: I'll try
[13:14:24] <martco> would you guys say that using .css() is lazier than .addClass ?
[13:14:29] <martco> like is one better practive
[13:14:32] <martco> practice
[13:14:34] <martco> thanks
[13:14:35] <misterm> Hory: or you can pass click a function that .apply() 's increaseCount to the object you want
[13:15:19] <ScottO_> when accessing data in a js object, how would i access the first key in an array?
[13:15:20] <notjrbauer> NP Snugug, I'm gonna try and look at the jqmobile when I have time later tonight and if you're on let you know what's up
[13:15:39] <Ahtenus> How do I bind a click handler on a click, without making the click handler trigger?
[13:15:41] <ScottO_> the data is Foo.0.Bar but i didnt want to use 0
[13:15:51] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Sounds good, thank you much. If I'm not on later tonight I'll be on tomorrow
[13:16:12] <preinheimer> I'm looking to hire someone to do some jquery (drag & drop, save state) for me, my JS skills are lacking. Problem page & explanation: http://example.preinheimer.com/jqueryhelp/ ($50? paypal, I don't think this would be too bad if I knew what I was doing)
[13:16:17] <Ahtenus> Here's the code: http://ahtenus.dyndns.org/ccache/js/main.js
[13:16:43] <necromancer> martco: it depends on what you're doing. my rule of thumb is to use .css() when you're just changing like 1 or 2 properties, or when the properties you're changing are dependent on some calculation made beforehand in JS...like if you set .css({width: someWidthVariable});
[13:16:58] <necromancer> sorry lol .css({width: someWidthVariable+'px'});
[13:17:10] <jsalot> There has to be a quicker way to write this right? http://pastebin.com/LZxPQ39G
[13:17:14] <Hory> misterm: is it better if I just forget trying to make the application object oriented? I don't understand why it has to be so complicated to get a method's object from inside the method...
[13:17:21] <necromancer> martco: classes are loaded quicker, easier to change, and easier to select.
[13:17:25] <martco> necromancer: yeah it seems that would be a good use case.
[13:17:40] <necromancer> generally you want to avoid using JS to style stuff
[13:17:47] <necromancer> maybe to make style changes, but not to create styles for things
[13:17:50] <martco> necromancer: for example i want to add a "success" class to div if the ajax data validates
[13:17:55] <misterm> Hory: well it's just that you seem to be going about OOP the wrong way, or at least not in the JS way
[13:18:05] <martco> necromancer: addClass feels better
[13:18:07] <necromancer> martco: yeah you want addClass
[13:18:15] <martco> thanks necromancer
[13:18:15] <misterm> Hory: let me ask you this, do you intend for there to be more than one "myApp" object?
[13:18:29] <jsalot> necromancer is correct, if at ever possible to compile css into a class and use JS to remove or add a class, you should always opt to use a class vs inline styles with jquery.
[13:18:30] <necromancer> martco: the best part about classes is they're easier to change in the testing phase. like if you want to alter the color or positioning
[13:18:37] <Hory> no but I would like it to be subclassable
[13:18:45] <martco> necromancer: right exactly
[13:19:03] <martco> necromancer: i was running into bugs with addClass then got lazy and was like well let me just .css() this
[13:19:17] <martco> necromancer: but then i thought that was too lazy, thanks for the cofnirmation
[13:19:20] <necromancer> Hory: you're thinking of a classical approach to OOP. here's what JavaScript's OOP is actually like: http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html
[13:20:00] <misterm> Hory: oop in JS is a little confusing because there's a few different ways to do it depending on what you need
[13:20:29] <misterm> Hory: but essentially, what you want to do is attach instance properties in the constructor, and shared properties to the prototype
[13:20:37] <necromancer> there are no "classes" in javascript
[13:20:40] <necromancer> just objects
[13:20:49] <necromancer> that's really the only difference between JS and most other OOP langauges
[13:20:58] <misterm> Hory: and then you can inherit by prototype chaining and constructor stealing
[13:21:21] <Krambfhase> there are no "classes" in javascript << Ofcourse there are "classes" in JS
[13:21:24] <Hory> misterm: btw, I was using "new MyApp()" in my real code, "new" is not in the jsfiddle example (if it makes a difference)
[13:22:20] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Hmm, it seems as if swipe doesn't always bind properly and/or loses its bind
[13:23:10] <preinheimer> tbranyen: looks like twitter it is :), thanks for giving me the thumbs up
[13:23:31] <tbranyen> preinheimer: :)
[13:24:10] <preinheimer> Not many followers, let's hope the hash tag helps.
[13:24:32] <notjrbauer> snugug are u able to post your code
[13:24:40] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Yah, sure
[13:24:51] <misterm> Hory: part of the problem is you're sort of mixing things up...you have a constructor but it looks like what you really want is just a little module/namespace...which would be better as just an object or closure
[13:25:15] <misterm> Hory: if you need to inherit you could use an object and then mixin
[13:25:28] <Snugug> notjrbauer: http://pastebin.com/WNw8bDXh
[13:26:25] <tiemonster> If I'm doing drag and drop with a sortable, how do I know what the original element was?
[13:26:38] <Hory> problem is that "object" doesn't seem to work like the objects from the other OOP languages...
[13:27:25] <daneroo> Is there an IRC channel for jquery-UI ?
[13:28:23] <tiemonster> you're in it
[13:28:28] <notjrbauer> Snugug are u able to do it something like this: http://pastebin.com/PaqmZetf
[13:28:39] <notjrbauer> im kinda in a rush atm
[13:29:12] <bl4ckcomb`> Hory, that's because JS isn't a complete OO language
[13:29:32] <Snugug> notjrbauer: Not a problem. Basically have it trigger a click of a button to do the next and previous as opposed to call them directly?
[13:29:54] <daneroo> I have a .sortable() linked to a .draggable({connectToSortable: '.myothersortable'}) which works great. But when I style the sortable to get grid behavior, the connected draggable stops working ? Any Ideas?
[13:30:06] <notjrbauer> yeah that's the easiest way I did it with mine
[13:30:12] <notjrbauer> i had buttons too though
[13:30:13] <misterm> JS is a pretty OOP language, it just works a little different than some others
[13:30:18] <Hory> I'll just make a global object for the app and forget using the unintuitive "this"
[13:30:55] <Snugug> notjrbauer: I'll give it a try, although it seems like an extra step when I'm essentially just going to call what's already there
[13:31:01] <misterm> Hory: here is a typical JS module pattern http://jsfiddle.net/JKWT9/
[13:33:34] <misterm> Hory: you could also do it with a closure, where everything is just variables...but by using an Object you could mixin myApp to something else if you wanted
[13:34:09] <Hory> misterm: can you check your example please, clicking the button doesn't do anything
[13:35:00] <misterm> Hory: just pay attention to the structure
[13:35:16] <misterm> there's a typo I didn't fix, but if you change
[13:35:20] <misterm> it it will work
[13:35:28] <Hory> i changed the comma into a dot but it doesnt' work
[13:35:51] <misterm> Hory: you need to put myApp.increaseCount in the click listener
[13:36:35] <Hory> thanks, it works
[13:37:47] <grid_> hey i just figured out that i need a popup like http://yensdesign.com/tutorials/popupjquery/, how do i call it with a hyperlink?
[13:38:09] <grid_> instead of a submit button request a href request i'm looking at
[13:39:08] <Krinkle> Is there a way I can get an object with all attributes in jQuery ?
[13:39:20] <Krinkle> I was hoping attr() without arguments
[13:41:00] <phlp> Krinkle: $('a')[0].attributes
[13:41:17] <Krinkle> cross-browser reliable ?
[13:41:31] <Krinkle> IE6, FF2 etc. like jQuery
[13:43:56] <Krinkle> phlp: .attributes (in Chrome) returns a NamedNodeMap with numeral keys in which there are instances of Attr with property .name and .nodeValue
[13:44:20] <daneroo> jQuery-ui question : I have a .sortable() linked to a .draggable({connectToSortable: '.myothersortable'}) which works great. But when I style the sortable to get grid behavior, the connected draggable stops working ? Any Ideas?
[13:45:49] <Krinkle> not exactly an object with attribute key/values. I know it could be constructed from there, but I doubt it would be cross-browser reliable. basically the reason Im looking for this is so I can do an deepEqual (QUnit object comparison function) to compare two elements and ensure it comes out as expected
[13:46:09] <Krinkle> I tried a comparison of .html() but Firefox has a different attribute order than WebKit.
[13:46:23] <Krinkle> so the strings don't match
[13:46:40] <z1000> is there a way to see jQuery / DOM working in realtime? ex: if I hover a button with a function... can I see this code being called / run somehow? I am messing with fire query but doesnt seem to do that exactky?
[13:46:59] <cook1es_> http://jsfiddle.net/esDGB/4/ Anyone please?

[13:59:50] <SpecialEmily> Krambfhase, ah yea thats pretty close to what I want, with one issue though, I can't select the parent object correctly ._.
[14:00:14] <SpecialEmily> what if the full path is: div.ting p.title:contains('derp')
[14:00:49] <SpecialEmily> $('div.thing p.title:container(derp)') only gives me the <P> tag
[14:01:20] <SpecialEmily> if I want to .hide() the containing div, how would I go about doing that?
[14:02:44] <shesek> SpecialEmily, closest('div.thing').hide()
[14:03:27] <Krinkle> phlp: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html#attributes
[14:03:32] <shesek> or simply .parent().hide() if its a direct parent
[14:03:48] <SoftLight> Can anyone help me with a form ? http://www.autohunter.com.au/register/ it's validating everything but when I press Register it's showing a alert window instead of submiting the form  ! Can anyone help ?
[14:04:02] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/KWWQw/ <- anyone able to tell me why position is always -1?
[14:04:51] <shesek> SpecialEmily, or just $('div.thing:has(p.title:container(derp))').hide(), but I assume you meant contains() because there's no such thing container() (at least not as part of jQuery core)
[14:05:28] <phlp> Krinkle: yes i seen that but most of the incorrect is because of the order which shouldnt matter in your case? older IEs will list them all but they will either be ="null" or =""
[14:06:31] <Layke> Anyplugins which are like the banner? http://www.ironstratus.com/ With the whole three divs sliding out.
[14:07:27] <Assimilater> can someone help me out with this syntax error, it says i'm missing a ) but i don't see it... http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/8/
[14:07:29] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: its in mktSignup.js submitHandler
[14:07:33] <r3v3rb> ;)
[14:07:53] <SoftLight> r3v3rb, I got that as I've seen the code , but how do I fix it ?
[14:07:59] <r3v3rb> remove it
[14:08:09] <Assimilater> it says what is line 8 in the fiddle...
[14:08:10] <r3v3rb> its irrelevant
[14:08:42] <SoftLight> all mktSignup ? or just submitHandler ?
[14:09:10] <r3v3rb> just the alert line in submithandler
[14:09:36] <SoftLight> if I remove just the alert line still it's not submiting the form
[14:09:48] <SoftLight> when I click on Register it's doing nothing
[14:09:54] <r3v3rb> where did the mktSignup come from
[14:10:08] <phlp> Assimilater: line 8 "top: yScroll + 'px'" should be "{top: yScroll + 'px'}"
[14:10:16] <SoftLight> r3v3rb,  what do you men ?
[14:10:32] <SoftLight> mean*
[14:10:36] <r3v3rb> did you write it as you seem unsure of the code being used?
[14:10:56] <SoftLight> no ... I took it from jquery website
[14:10:58] <Assimilater> oh...
[14:11:07] <Assimilater> so if there's an argument with : it needs to be in { }
[14:11:20] <r3v3rb> yes Assimilater

[14:13:56] <SoftLight> in the same page
[14:14:02] <SoftLight> I have action=""
[14:14:29] <r3v3rb> right, so where is the form mean't to go when submitted
[14:14:38] <r3v3rb> meant even
[14:15:09] <SoftLight> well he should submit the information to the same page ... the php page it's index.php?slug=register
[14:15:53] <r3v3rb> okay, have you placed some code in the function for registration to see if it gets there ?
[14:16:00] <r3v3rb> in the php?
[14:16:04] <SoftLight> yes
[14:16:07] <SoftLight> it doesn't
[14:16:11] <SoftLight> when it get's there
[14:16:12] <r3v3rb> cool
[14:16:25] <r3v3rb> so it never gets there
[14:16:29] <SoftLight> the email you put should receive a confirmation code,
[14:16:33] <SoftLight> no ... for sure
[14:16:48] <SoftLight> I tested all the php before starting with the validation
[14:16:52] <r3v3rb> can you post the php?

[14:23:27] <Assimilater> this almost works, it just doesn't properly grab the scroll postition. If you scroll so the first view button is at the top of the window and then click the third view button, then click it again it puts you at the top of the window instead of at the top of the first contact http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/12/
[14:23:32] <Assimilater> if that makes any sense, lol
[14:23:32] <bijoo> Hey, how can I add headers to the jquery ajax method please?

[14:26:29] <ciberglo> Hello. I'm dealing with a problem with my 'dialog', where I can't have buttons with ordinary text. Just "Save" and Cancel works. Can anyone help?
[14:26:32] <r3v3rb> phlp: i am a spanner :D
[14:26:38] <r3v3rb> doh!
[14:26:41] <bijoo> Hi, how can I set the ajax headers please? See pastebin please http://pastebin.com/vGUVczUx
[14:26:57] <Assimilater> man my timing sucks.... :S
[14:27:12] <nbari> hi all, i am using php with jquery for a chat, currently I discover that storing on a var the $.ajax can help for later use the .abort() and cancell that current ajax query, but now I need to find if there are any ajax query running so I can avoid creating a loop and avoid calliing the same function.
[14:27:25] <Assimilater> it's freaking rush hour....
[14:27:52] <r3v3rb> phlp: i got confused with the div's and the li's - idiot i am - thanks
[14:27:58] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: yes looking now
[14:28:11] <phlp> np :)
[14:28:15] <nbari> any ideas? or is there a jquery command that can help overloading functions or running more than 1 function/ajax at the same time ?
[14:28:17] <k1t> can anyone tell me how come firebug's telling me i'm missing a curly bracket on this ajax method call? http://pastebin.com/U5PeUbPR
[14:29:08] <ciberglo> bijoo: Does this (http://pastebin.com/H1ymuAZ6) work?
[14:29:36] <k1t> or where that curly bracket might go? lol it says the properties list is missing it, but it seems Ok to me
[14:29:44] <bijoo> ciberglo: trying it now. thanks mate.
[14:30:20] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: where does ($_POST['reg'] get set in the html form? I can't see a hidden input or anything
[14:30:49] <SoftLight> there is a hidden input immediatly
[14:30:55] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: ignore, seen it
[14:30:55] <SoftLight> after the <form>
[14:30:58] <SoftLight> ok
[14:30:59] <SoftLight> :)
[14:31:05] <ciberglo> k1t: does this (http://pastebin.com/RNsjNmG9) work?
[14:31:50] <k1t> ciberglo: nope, had it loading after the doc was finished loading already..
[14:31:57] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: is this in drupal?
[14:32:01] <SoftLight> no
[14:32:03] <SoftLight> custom
[14:32:09] <k1t> ciberglo: my code is like that already i mean
[14:32:16] <k1t> ty tho lol
[14:32:43] <bijoo> ciberglo: No, unfortunately it didn't work. I got "Invalid object initializer" error. Changing the inner squiqqly brackets to regular brackets resulted in no success either.
[14:33:20] <ciberglo> bijoo: Sorry, I can't help. I've never used cookies, just was reading $.ajax documentation at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/. Have you had a look at it?
[14:33:52] <phlp> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/8HgAn/13
[14:34:05] <bijoo> ciberglo: Yes, I've looked at it and undesrtand I'm supposed to pass a Map object. I've tried it several times now in several ways, but none of them are working.
[14:34:45] <Assimilater> phlp: my goal was to scroll back to where the user was before clicking view
[14:34:53] <Assimilater> not leave the current div on the top of the window
[14:36:35] <mnewman> Hello, anyone help me with some jiquery to focus to say the (N) Input text field?
[14:36:59] <ciberglo> bijoo: Sorry can't continue helping, I'm dealing with another problem
[14:37:10] <bijoo> ciberglo: thanks anyways mate.
[14:37:19] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: if i where you i would lose mktSignup and write my own validation for jquery.validate
[14:37:44] <SoftLight> r3v3rb, if you where me .. you where a begginer in jquery :D
[14:38:11] <SoftLight> anyway
[14:38:12] <misterm> mnewman: pastebin or jsfiddle your code
[14:38:19] <SoftLight> I'll keep trying
[14:38:26] <SoftLight> thank you a lot r3v3rb
[14:39:01] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: try removing the whole submithandler
[14:39:04] <conee> is there any way to access the jquery ui dialog show callback?
[14:39:14] <SoftLight> that I was going to do now :d
[14:39:26] <k1t> ciberglo: I was missing a comm
[14:39:28] <k1t> comma*
[14:39:42] <r3v3rb> SoftLight: you dont need it as you are using php and redirecting to the same script
[14:39:51] <conee> i want to perform things after the dialog has finished animating, but i cannot find a callback for the end of the animation
[14:39:53] <r3v3rb> submithandler is for using ajax afaik
[14:40:18] <SoftLight> so it's somehow done for security reasons ?
[14:40:21] <[2]princeES> I am trying to load the video on the div but it wouldnt work please have a look ...http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[14:40:46] <r3v3rb> or at least using more jquery to do stuff when submission has completed via ajax
[14:41:05] <phlp> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/8HgAn/15
[14:41:20] <[2]princeES> <r3v3rb> can you please help me :(
[14:41:29] <misterm> [2]princeES: can you just "go ahead now" and list the steps to reproduce the problem
[14:42:03] <orolo> i need to disable all events on all of the children of a dom element.
[14:42:04] <[2]princeES> i have been trying to do since yesterday,,,
[14:42:08] <orolo> and then reenable them.
[14:42:14] <phlp> Assimilater: hmm still doesnt always work
[14:42:21] <[2]princeES> and still cant able to load the video on the main div
[14:42:28] <orolo> is there a good way to disable all events like that?
[14:42:29] <[2]princeES> therefore, asking here..
[14:42:43] <mnewman> Hi, I have been able to focus to the next input field however I would like to focus to the 10th input box. These inputs are all dynamically generated
[14:44:10] <orolo> mnewman: $.each('.input-box', function (index, Element) { if (index === 9) {$(this).focus() }); //something like that?
[14:45:58] <SoftLight> r3v3rb, I've seen something
[14:46:14] <ciberglo> k1t: nice to hear. so, congratulations
[14:46:20] <SoftLight> in the validate() class ... I have debug:true
[14:46:32] <Assimilater> phlp: just to pick your thought process, why the need for using hide's callback function?
[14:46:35] <SoftLight> do you think this could be ?
[14:46:36] <misterm> mnewman: depends on your DOM structure, but you probably want to look into the .children() or .find() methods
[14:46:58] <misterm> mnewman: and then you can just get the nth element with .get(n) or $(selector)[n]
[14:47:18] <misterm> mnewman: and then call .focus()
[14:47:20] <Assimilater> phlp: in any case i figure you will inevitably be scrolling up, so it's not like the position moves on you
[14:47:42] <ciberglo> Have anyone had a problem with dialog buttons not accepting space on its Text ?
[14:48:01] <mnewman> Thank you all for your help, I' give it a shot.
[14:48:04] <Assimilater> phlp: nevermind, i take that back i suppose it's possible for someone to scroll up and click a button above the previous one, haha
[14:48:11] <orolo> mnewman: maybe $('.my-class').eq('9').
[14:48:16] <r3v3rb> try it, never used debug in validate SoftLight
[14:48:22] <Ezep> I'm almost new to jQuery, and I have some question about toggle(). I have some kind of 'tabs' and I want to close all other tabs and open a certain tab when a tab is clicked. Is toggle() the best function to use this?
[14:48:44] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to select all <parent>'s whose <child> value is x?
[14:49:04] <timwis> or do I have to select all <child>s with value x and then find their parent?
[14:49:07] <orolo> timwis $('.child').parent();
[14:49:18] <timwis> orolo, yeah, that's what I thought. okay, thx.
[14:49:35] <phlp> Assimilater: well one problem is $('window') should be $(window) but it still has issues
[14:49:48] <orolo> or the other way $('.parent').find('.child');
[14:50:06] <Assimilater> ah...
[14:51:00] <phlp> Assimilater: the issue now is the scroll finishes before the thing expands so if theres not room to scroll down before it never gets to the button. which the callback should fix
[14:51:04] <bl4ckcomb`> is it considered a good practice to load jquery html template files via <script type="text/html" src="/path/to/the/template.html"></script> ?
[14:51:27] <[2]princeES> i am having problem for loading video on the div -- http://jsfiddle.net/PWCf5/

[14:53:35] <[2]princeES> i have been trying since yesterday..
[14:53:42] <[2]princeES> more than 48 hours working on it..
[14:53:43] <phlp> Assimilater: yep looks good
[14:53:50] <orolo> your success should look more like /2/
[14:53:57] <[2]princeES> please help me
[14:54:05] <orolo> i think.
[14:54:15] <[2]princeES> i even ready to pay if you guys can help me
[14:55:07] <[2]princeES> I will first pay.. and then you will send me the code...
[14:55:32] <[2]princeES> i just want to fix it up... which i have been facing since last couple of days
[14:55:35] <Assimilater> [2]princeES: well for one you're doing an ajax request in jsfiddle, which it's not generally too kind at, as near as i can tell your main problem is the file you're trying to ajax doesn't exist
[14:55:48] <Assimilater> apart from that i can't really tell what you're trying to do
[14:56:04] <[2]princeES> look on it... http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[14:56:11] <[2]princeES> here is the everything..
[14:56:17] <[2]princeES> you can see rendered code
[14:57:01] <[2]princeES> on the 4 thumbnail...there is a video
[14:57:16] <[2]princeES> and as you can see ,,, there is a button called "play movie"
[14:57:25] <[2]princeES> i just want to make it work ...
[14:57:42] <Assimilater> when clicking play i get the error: 'swfobject not defined'
[14:57:46] <[2]princeES> once someone will click on this button or whatever... video will load on the div
[14:57:48] <Krinkle> phlp: I ran a fake unit test on test swarm to see what the different browsers do with .attributes http://toolserver.org/~krinkle/testswarm/job/208/
[14:57:52] <Assimilater> on slider, line 43
[14:58:02] <[2]princeES> ohhh
[14:58:03] <Krinkle> phlp: ignore the red squares, just click the numbers and see the data
[14:58:08] <[2]princeES> let me fix it up
[14:58:23] <[2]princeES> actually, i was thinking to pass a function...
[14:58:49] <Krinkle> phlp: most support both numerical and string index, and IE6 includes all attrs
[14:58:54] <[2]princeES> and the param of video so... each of other will handle inside this sperate function ...
[14:59:18] <[2]princeES> just want to make it like as this... http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[14:59:48] <Assimilater> can't say i can necessarily help, i'm not a pro as scripting, i've only been doing it for half a year
[14:59:52] <Assimilater> i can point out errors
[14:59:57] <misterm> [2]princeES: one thing I reccomend is not using alert for debugging
[14:59:59] <Assimilater> but any browser with web developer tools can do that
[15:00:09] <Assimilater> firefox -> firebug
[15:00:15] <muzone> http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=124212234311737&view=all
[15:00:17] <muzone> look at that
[15:00:18] <Assimilater> chrome -> web developer tools built in
[15:01:05] <[2]princeES> ok...
[15:01:14] <[2]princeES> i am doing as you are saying to me...
[15:01:25] <[2]princeES> but.,..one thing need to know..
[15:01:42] <[2]princeES> Is it really hard to make it like as i want...?
[15:01:53] <misterm> [2]princeES: the problem right now is you're calling swfobject.embedSWF, but swfobject doesn't exist on the page
[15:02:16] <Mindore_> any danish or norwegian people here? :)
[15:03:24] <[2]princeES> maybe because i am not using the library for this swfobject?
[15:03:25] <Assimilater> phlp: you know what this 'f is null' error i keep getting from scrollTop is?
[15:03:31] <misterm> [2]princeES: you load jQuery, Awkward Showcase, and some little script...but no swfobject
[15:03:45] <misterm> [2]princeES: yea, pretty much
[15:04:57] <phlp> Assimilater: i was getting that when it was 'window' in quotes because scrollTop returned null. sending it directly to scrollTo threw that error i think
[15:06:11] <Assimilater> phlp: ah...i was in the wrong jsfiddle tab, garh :S
[15:09:15] <timwis> is there a way to select all <h1>'s whose contents are "A" ?
[15:09:26] <timwis> i.e. <h1>A</h1>  but not <h1>B</h1>
[15:09:48] <timwis> Or do I have to do $('h1:contains("A")') ?
[15:11:55] <byteman_> I'm using jquery.unobtrusive-ajax to validate a textbox that must be unique via a remote validation. On form save I call .valid() on the form which triggers the validation but the call comes back true when the remote validation call is still in progress. Is there a way to force the remote validation to be syncronous so that the validation won't come back true when the remote call isn't finished?
[15:18:52] <[2]princeES> <Assimilater> can you please check my code...
[15:19:15] <[2]princeES> i have added swfobject library and even made some change on my code...

[15:32:49] <[2]princeES> what do you think?
[15:47:42] <kukosk> is there a way to change for example 'width' of a CSS CLASS ? so every inserted object with that class will be 'following the rules' ?
[15:52:27] <Assimilater> anyone know of a draggable plugin for jquery ui? I'm thinking of ui buttons in perhaps a ul that the user can change the order on in a horizontal bar
[15:53:06] <Dr4g> This page is gonna be jquery-ified - so I hope it's ok here to post this. We use jquery as our official JS lib :)
[15:53:11] <Dr4g> The new ppi community page design - comments pls ? http://t.co/1IgQMut
[15:53:26] <Dr4g> ( I don't know where else on IRC to post this for "Designer/Frontend guy" input.
[15:55:46] <Vespakoen> Hey guys, when i send my form with document.getElementById('form').submit(); it send most of my data exept for the ones with special characters in it (? etc.) is this a known issue and is there a way to solve this ?
[16:02:11] <Assimilater> anyone know of a draggable plugin for jquery ui? I'm thinking of ui buttons in perhaps a ul that the user can change the order on in a horizontal bar
[16:02:36] <jedimind> jquery ui has draggable built in?
[16:02:55] <Assimilater> it does?
[16:02:58] <Assimilater> did i miss a doc?
[16:03:00] * Assimilater looks again
[16:03:01] <miwillhite> it does
[16:04:11] <Krinkle> Is there a better way to get the result of .find(selector).andSelf().filter(selector)  ?
[16:04:20] <Assimilater> ah i see
[16:04:28] <miwillhite> krinkle, what are you trying to do?
[16:04:30] <Assimilater> i'm used to looking at the widgets tab
[16:04:39] <Assimilater> holy crap there's more here than i thought, haha
[16:05:28] <Krinkle> miwillhite: I'm writing a plugin that will do something with all elements that have attribute foo-bar set. Right now I do this.each(function(){  $(this).find( '[foobar]' ).magic(); });
[16:05:43] <Krinkle> but it now only works for the childrin
[16:06:08] <miwillhite> why can't you just use an attribute selector?
[16:06:38] <Krinkle> miwillhite: The plugin is about 2500 lines, it's a little more complicated then that ;-)
[16:06:42] <Krinkle> this is part of it
[16:06:44] <miwillhite> okay sure
[16:07:19] <Krinkle> does about 10 x a find().magic() then .end() and different .find().something().end()
[16:07:34] <miwillhite> I guess I meant‚Ä¶what are you trying to do with that line of code‚Ä¶
[16:07:44] <Krinkle> but I like to have it work for single elements as well, I find users are wrapping it in a <div> and unwraping after using the plugin
[16:07:58] <miwillhite> yikes
[16:08:05] <Krinkle> exactly.
[16:08:46] <Krinkle> so it replaces a placeholder attribute with a live value, but it should do that for any element it encouters that has that attribute.
[16:09:07] <Krinkle> I rather not to find(sel).andSelf().filter(sel);
[16:09:28] <Krinkle> if andSelf took a filter, that'd be an improvement.
[16:09:57] <miwillhite> I see
[16:10:05] <Krinkle> another way would be to .add( this.find('*')  ) and then filter(selector)
[16:10:06] <sanity> how can I make http://gapadmob.appspot.com/http://blog.locut.us/ work more like http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/about/features.html - where the linked pages open up to the right of the menu, rather than replacing the entire page?
[16:10:12] <Krinkle> but thats just as ugly
[16:11:02] <miwillhite> so you need something like closest() is to parents(), but for children()
[16:11:11] <Krinkle> basically a find() but one that keeps 'self' (as long as it matches the selector)
[16:11:27] <blindMoe> sanity: just look at the source code of the jquerymobile site and see how they did it
[16:11:30] <miwillhite> right
[16:11:45] <Krinkle> s/keeps/doesnt remove
[16:12:03] <miwillhite> unfortunately I'm not aware of anything specific for that‚Ä¶
[16:12:32] <miwillhite> unless it would make sense to jump to the parent of the element you are searching on
[16:14:48] <Krinkle> miwillhite: There may not be a parent yet (plugin is usually ran before it's inserted into document)
[16:14:57] <Krinkle> it=elements
[16:15:29] <sherjilozair> I want to make rows and columns of a table get highlighted when I hover over them.
[16:15:49] <sherjilozair> How can I do that ?
[16:16:48] <miwillhite> Krinkle, you may just be best off making a custom jquery selector‚Ä¶I think what you have isn't pretty, but not horrible either
[16:17:35] <Krinkle> miwillhite: you mean like .findWithSelf() ?
[16:18:06] <miwillhite> yeah kind of, http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/06/custom-jquery-selectors.html
[16:18:21] <miwillhite> this has a little writeup‚Ä¶ but it may not be worth it if you only use it in one place
[16:18:40] <miwillhite> I don't know your plugin, you'll just have to weigh the benefits
[16:18:47] <Krinkle> I could hide the uglyness in there, but then .end() wouldn't work as expected since before and after findWithSelf would no longer be 1 jquery collection change
[16:18:55] <miwillhite> oh right
[16:19:08] <Edokter> hey krinkle :)
[16:19:15] <miwillhite> .end is so ugly anyway‚Ä¶
[16:19:38] <Krinkle> miwillhite: It's a great method and when used properly can speed up a script significantly
[16:19:54] <miwillhite> cool cool, sorry I can't help, good luck :P
[16:20:30] <Krinkle> miwillhite: http://i.imgur.com/hcbcz.png
[16:21:18] <miwillhite> got it, I can see where it has its uses
[16:23:54] <Edokter> I need an animation expert
[16:28:38] <aaairc> is it fine to have two difference $(document).ready() functions on the same page
[16:28:46] <aaairc> or can you only have 1 per page load?
[16:29:38] <misterm> aaairc: you can have more than one
[16:29:51] <aaairc> misterm: cool thanks
[16:35:31] <sanity> blindMoe: I've tried to do that, but its hard to see what specifically causes the different behavior
[16:41:09] <Assimilater> umm....can anyone spot why i'm getting a recursive effect here? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/19/

[17:12:47] <imsky> Mono, yes, every jquery UI distribution comes with css files in their own directory
[17:12:58] <Mono> OK.

[17:20:20] <Assimilater> wow quiet in here....
[17:22:46] <bsmith> what happens if i bind to an event on an element twice? e.g. $(elt).bind('click', func1); $(elt).bind('click', func2);
[17:22:54] <bsmith> will both fire, or will func1 be unbound?
[17:24:03] <coldhead> both will fire
[17:24:26] <coldhead> would be hard to make rich APIs if they cancelled prior binds out!
[17:24:43] <coldhead> the tricky thing is getting them to fire in a particular order
[17:24:47] <coldhead> so try not to depend on that
[17:25:18] <bsmith> great, that's useful to know about ordering
[17:25:20] <bsmith> thanks
[17:25:29] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to make autocomplete from jquery UI work with dynamic information such as php?
[17:25:30] <bsmith> couldn't find that on the .bind() doc
[17:27:04] <coldhead> Es0teric: that should be the ajax related stuff in the documentation
[17:27:16] <coldhead> it will send to the server for more data
[17:27:26] <coldhead> and you need to work out what it sends and what to send back
[17:27:34] <coldhead> it's a typical use case
[17:28:42] <Es0teric> coldhead, i have an example of what i am working with... can you take a look at it real quick? because i dont understand why it doesnt work
[17:29:33] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://pastie.org/2210011
[17:30:38] <Assimilater> ooh yay, coldhead is in the house
[17:30:51] <Assimilater> coldhead: you happen to notice my question? ^^
[17:34:32] <atxq> hey guys, so is it possible to open a new window, and once the new window opens, change the bg color of the old window?
[17:36:04] <codecab> atxq: place some js in the opened window which does that for you
[17:36:50] <atxq> how can I pass js to the old window?
[17:39:10] <codecab> use window.opener to access the "old window"
[17:40:14] <atxq> not working here
[17:41:23] <Assimilater> can anyone spot why i'm getting a recursive effect here (when you click on the view it constantly hides itself instead of hiding all .full that are not the variable)? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/19/
[17:42:24] <coldhead> too complex for me sorry Assimilater
[17:42:48] <coldhead> Es0teric: like i said, check out the docs for autocomplete AJAX
[17:43:05] <coldhead> and if you're not using AJAX, paste the generated HTML, not the PHP
[17:45:01] <Es0teric> coldhead, what generated html? there is no generated html... just terms in quotes seperated by commas...
[17:45:31] <Es0teric> if i manually type in the words like... "bird", "plane", "boat" etc.. it works
[17:45:36] <codecab> atxq: how do you open the window?
[17:45:46] <coldhead> your PHP might be generating bogus HTML
[17:45:49] <coldhead> i can't tell
[17:45:53] <coldhead> i am not a PHP interpreter
[17:46:10] <coldhead> paste what's actually in your browser, after PHP has had its way with it, y'know?
[17:46:17] <Es0teric> coldhead, its not generating HTML.. its generating words from the database
[17:47:00] <Es0teric> coldhead, the words are generated LIKE THIS: "term1", "term2", "term3", "term4"
[17:47:43] <Es0teric> so its basically data = ["term1", "term2", "term3", "term4"];
[17:48:05] <Assimilater> coldhead: try comparing versions 16 and 19, version 16 works, the goal is to do what 16 does but making sure that other divs previously clicked on get hidden before opening a second one (if you clicked on two buttons without clicking the first one a second time to hide it again)
[17:48:52] <coldhead> Es0teric: it's generating stuff for your browser, is what i mean. stuff you see when you "view source"
[17:49:15] <coldhead> there's probably broken quotes or something
[17:49:29] <Es0teric> coldhead, i can tell you this much... there are no broken quotes and its not generating invalid information
[17:49:51] <coldhead> you can TELL me that but can you just paste the stuff from your browser?
[17:49:56] <coldhead> because i don't know PHP!
[17:50:01] <coldhead> it's my first day using php
[17:50:43] <Es0teric> coldhead, if its your first day using php then i dont think u can help me...
[17:50:48] <coldhead> sorry Es0teric
[17:51:00] <Es0teric> its alright..
[17:51:05] <coldhead> i would ask in ##php for you but i am banned from there
[17:51:17] <Assimilater> coldhead: why?
[17:51:18] <Es0teric> lol coldhead, im workin with wordpress
[17:51:32] <coldhead> Assimilater: apparently my views on gypsies are not appreciated :(
[17:51:48] <Assimilater> lol, no i bet not (cough off-topic)
[17:53:28] <coldhead> fascists
[17:53:41] <coldhead> Es0teric: i'm worried that something liek this is happening: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/438231/
[17:53:49] <coldhead> that would freak JS out
[17:54:01] <coldhead> but i can't tell unless you paste the generated stuff
[17:56:36] <Es0teric> coldhead, it doesnt look like any of that...
[17:56:58] <coldhead> I WOULDN'T KNOW
[17:57:03] <coldhead> BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE IT
[17:57:04] <coldhead> :P
[17:58:02] <Es0teric> it looks like it should
[17:58:20] <coldhead> well then it works, right!
[17:58:24] <coldhead> case cloased!
[17:58:36] <coldhead> >>>: |
[17:58:46] <obsd123> my code seems to have a race condition even though I'm waiting for my iframe to load with $.load() http://pastebin.com/xmg2Z9Pk
[17:59:21] <Assimilater> coldhead: did you try comparing versions 16 and 19?
[17:59:44] * Assimilater doesn't think this is beyond you from past experience, you're just jumping in at the end
[17:59:46] <Es0teric> coldhead, it DOESNT WORK
[17:59:48] <codecab> Assimilater: did you try show instead of toggle?
[17:59:51] <Es0teric> thats why i am in here...
[18:00:13] <Assimilater> codecab: the reason i use toggle is because i want it to hide when they push the button a second time
[18:02:38] <coldhead> Es0teric: help us help you! why won't you just paste the stuff generated by php?
[18:02:52] <coldhead> then someone can say "oh look, it has this thing wrong with it"
[18:03:02] <Es0teric> coldhead, i will.... just give me a sec
[18:03:05] <coldhead> and you can fix it and we can get back to our tvs and wives
[18:03:10] <coldhead> and tv wives
[18:03:10] <codecab> Assimilater: why dont you hide all divs on every button click and just show the selected, if it was hidden before hiding?
[18:03:23] <codecab> :>
[18:03:32] <Assimilater> hmm
[18:03:36] <Assimilater> that would be simpler wouldn't it...
[18:03:38] <Assimilater> haha
[18:04:20] <coldhead> told you it was too complex for me, Assimilater
[18:04:50] <Assimilater> coldhead: k
[18:05:33] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/6/
[18:05:35] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[18:06:05] <Assimilater> coldhead: that's ridiculous, unles you're psoing...
[18:06:21] <Es0teric> it works with that... but for some reason, it doesnt work with the php code.. the idea is to have DYNAMIC terms
[18:06:59] <coldhead> Es0teric: by dynamic you mean you want it to keep asking the server for the terms?
[18:07:14] <coldhead> rather than load them all to begin with?
[18:07:25] <codecab> Es0teric: do you have line breaks or any other special characters in your generated data?
[18:07:54] <Es0teric> codecab, no i dont... and coldhead, dynamic as in the php code gets the data it requests based on how many terms there are
[18:08:40] <coldhead> Es0teric: like ttp://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote ?
[18:09:22] <coldhead> which uses http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-source
[18:13:30] <Es0teric> coldhead, what is in the search.php code?
[18:15:09] <Assimilater> codecab: doesn't change the fact that the function with $.scrollTo(...yScroll...) is getting called 7 times at the push of one button...it should never get called more than once
[18:15:17] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/8HgAn/22/
[18:15:50] <coldhead> Es0teric: i'm not sure where you can find the src online
[18:16:19] <obsd123> are there any gotchas using .load() with iframes?  The docs just seem to say that you can't use .live() or .delegate().  Still, I can't get past a race condition in this code http://pastebin.com/xmg2Z9Pk
[18:16:26] <coldhead> ajpiano: do you know where Es0teric can find the src to search.php in the UI autocomplete demo?
[18:16:46] <Assimilater> .load with iframes?
[18:16:48] <Assimilater> what is this?
[18:17:21] <Assimilater> if iframes are in the php or other script then no...but if you're trying to .load stuff into an iframe it's ridiculous....
[18:17:33] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ the overview near the bottom hhas the details of how it needs to work
[18:17:47] <Es0teric> coldhead, that does NOT give me the src to search.php...
[18:18:00] <Es0teric> i know how it works, but i dont know whats in search.php
[18:19:18] <Shazer2> hey
[18:20:24] <obsd123> Assimilator: it's not the ajax.load() it's the event handler .load ....
[18:21:31] <Shazer2> does anyone know how i can send back json from php?
[18:21:49] <Assimilater> obsd123: oh
[18:22:12] <Assimilater> codecab: stil with me?
[18:24:45] <innociv> How do I get the length of an object without doing an $.each on it?  I mean a type of object, not jquery object
[18:26:03] <innociv> .length returns undefined
[18:26:34] <Assimilater> eh, g2g
[18:27:20] <thebignoise> is there jQ version of PHP's str_replace?
[18:27:57] <thebignoise> .replace LOL but of course
[18:28:41] <inmotion> anyone available to help out with digital clock question?
[18:28:48] <marekweb> digital clock?
[18:28:56] <inmotion> js clock
[18:29:37] <marekweb> ok
[18:30:29] <inmotion> ok so i want to build a js clock,  hrs:min:sec
[18:30:40] <marekweb> yes
[18:30:41] <inmotion> and i want to animate (fade-in) each section on page_load
[18:30:49] <inmotion> section being hrs, min, seconds
[18:30:51] <inmotion> in sequence
[18:31:31] <inmotion> so i have the clock built in js, but what is the best way to separate the components
[18:31:38] <inmotion> right now i just have everything in one function
[18:31:55] <marekweb> split it into different functions
[18:33:11] <inmotion> when acted on by jquery for animation would that be smooth enough transition wise?
[18:35:11] <inmotion> thanks marek, gonna try to split it up now
[18:35:25] <coldhead> Es0teric: short of asking hobs and ajpiano i don't know how to view the src of that
[18:35:33] <coldhead> sorry
[18:35:50] <Es0teric> its alright coldhead, because i still have another problem... autocomplete wont work when i hardcode the information
[18:36:30] <coldhead> but you pasted that working demo!
[18:36:34] <coldhead> and it worked!
[18:36:35] <coldhead> i saw it!
[18:37:09] <coldhead> this guy has a PHP tutorial http://www.jensbits.com/2010/03/29/jquery-ui-autocomplete-widget-with-php-and-mysql/
[18:39:12] <Es0teric> coldhead, i went there already... but how could i get the PHP TO WORK when its not working when i hardcode it?
[18:45:23] <Shazer2> anyone know how to send back to json with php
[18:51:01] <coldhead> Es0teric: the hardcoded method and the ajax method are quite different, they could fuck up in very different ways
[18:51:16] <coldhead> Es0teric: if you can get a live demo of the broken version online somewhere...
[18:52:37] <Es0teric> coldhead, i meant hardcoded as in... i hardcoded the array on the "data" var
[18:53:37] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/6/ thats as close as i can get it online... it looks JUST like that but for some reason its not working for me on my page
[18:55:43] <coldhead> you're being very patient, Es0teric, i appreciate that
[18:56:34] <coldhead> Es0teric: if you log data to the console as on http://jsfiddle.net/sZPEZ/7/
[18:56:55] <coldhead> does that look okay on your console?
[18:57:03] <coldhead> in firebug or chrome web inspector?
[18:58:49] <Es0teric> coldhead, where do i see the console log on firebug?
[18:59:40] <coldhead> if you click the lil bug to open firebug, there should be a console tab
[18:59:47] <coldhead> you might have to click to enable it and reload
[19:00:40] <Es0teric> coldhead, nothing pops up on the console tab... no errors, nothing
[19:00:59] <coldhead> can you see the data on the jsfiddle version i linked to?
[19:01:44] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. Anybody got a good tutorial for "tabs" where the tab slides out with the content?
[19:02:31] <Es0teric> wow... firefox just crashed...
[19:02:35] <Es0teric> =_=
[19:03:11] <coldhead> uh oh
[19:06:06] <Es0teric> coldhead -> ["Airship", "Alchemy", "Alien", "Ancestry", "Angels"]
[19:06:12] <Es0teric> thats what shows up from jsfiddle
[19:08:06] <coldhead> that's what you want, Es0teric
[19:08:15] <coldhead> do you see something like that on your local setup?
[19:08:19] <coldhead> because you should
[19:09:43] <Es0teric> coldhead, i dont see that
[19:09:59] <coldhead> that suggests your JS might not be executing at all
[19:10:21] <coldhead> you can maybe confirm that by dropping an alert("hi there") before the rest of your JS
[19:10:28] <coldhead> and testing if that happens
[19:11:01] <Es0teric> ok... let me try that
[19:13:15] <Es0teric> coldhead, yeah the js isnt executing... for some reason
[19:14:13] <coldhead> maybe your script tag is wrong?
[19:14:25] <Es0teric> nope.. i dont think so
[19:14:33] <Es0teric> because the ajax is working for the search
[19:17:06] <coldhead> if you paste the code that isn't running maybe someone can see an error?
[19:18:06] <Es0teric> eh... i'll come back tomorrow

[20:05:39] <fourcolors> div*

[20:08:06] <Whirl3d> could someone help with binding/unbinding click events? http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/GAstr/
[20:08:09] <fourcolors> danka fris
[20:10:32] <Whirl3d> nvm, I just changed the scope of the event and it works.

[20:16:35] <jsalot> why would jslint say that var hash = window.location.hash; has an error of "'window' was used before it was defined."
[20:17:38] <systemfault> jsalot: Perhaps you have the wrong settings.
[20:17:58] <systemfault> jslint doesn't "think" it's running in a browser.
[20:18:26] <systemfault> So.. it checks if window is declared.. doesn't find it so you get that error
[20:18:30] <systemfault> JSLint sucks anyway.
[20:18:44] <systemfault> I heard that JSHint is better but I haven't tried it.
[20:20:39] <mattems> hey all
[20:45:43] <sherjilozair> hi, A big html table generated dynamically is not being shown completely, and I can't scroll down. Scrolling is disabled, even though, I didn't set up any such CSS. What seems to be the problem ?
[20:50:03] <misterm> sherjilozair: my toaster isn't working. What seems to be the problem with it?
[20:50:58] <sherjilozair> misterm: Is it plugged in firmly and switched on ?
[20:51:11] <sherjilozair> :P
[20:51:55] <misterm> sherjilozair: so what you're saying is you need information about the toaster to figure out what's wrong with it?
[20:52:31] <misterm> sherjilozair: perhaps looking at the toaster itself? that way you could just see if it's plugged in and turned on...instead of having to go through the list of all possible problems and asking...hmm
[20:52:32] <sherjilozair> I got your point. How should I show you the code ?
[20:52:59] <misterm> sherjilozair: a jsfiddle that reproduces the problem is the best way, less preferable you can use a pastebin
[20:53:09] <misterm> sherjilozair: or if you have a live site up
[20:57:52] <Whirl3d> how does slideUp and slideDown determine the height of the object if it's css initial state is set to Display:"none"?
[21:03:09] <ryanseddon> if it's didplay none then it will be 0 and jQuery will then animate the properties to reveal it
[21:03:13] <ryanseddon> display*
[21:03:59] <Whirl3d> When it reveals it, how does it determine how far to animate the item? It has to figure out the height at some point, doesn't it?
[21:04:28] <Whirl3d> The reason I am asking is that it appears to be guessing the height of my divs incorrectly.
[21:05:11] <Whirl3d> and the width for that matter. A small band of the content slidesDown() and then scoots over to show the full width (still partial height, though)
[21:08:42] <Whirl3d> I'm guessing this is another f*ing css issue rather than a jquery issue. I just made a fiddle of what I am trying to do and it appears to work just fine. UGG I hate CSS
[21:09:11] <Whirl3d> ryanseddon, thx for the reply.
[21:09:31] <ryanseddon> Probably good idea to see if it's getting styles inherited from else where to cause it to not display the full content
[21:13:39] <versatiletech> Whirl3d: yeah that's a CSS issue http://jqueryfordesigners.com/animation-jump-quick-tip/
[21:26:17] <macuser> if i want to hid an accordion when an <a> is clicked, how would i do that?
[21:26:48] <macuser> anyone?
[21:27:36] <heedly> macuser: .hide(), maybe
[21:27:50] <macuser> that didn't work
[21:28:06] <heedly> *shrug*, don't see why
[21:28:38] <macuser> *pulling my hair out" same here, if you saw the code might you be able to help?
[21:30:31] <heedly> probably not, sorry
[21:31:06] <macuser> http://jsfiddle.net/fjS3w/
[21:31:15] <macuser> any help at all would be appericated
[21:36:58] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I have this bit of code, that doesn't behave the way I expect:
[21:37:00] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.com/6eVUnfTJ
[21:37:27] <bobdobbs> I expect a string of alerts, telling the names if the ids
[21:37:44] <bobdobbs> Instead, I get one alert, followed by a js error.
[21:38:17] <gnarf> bobdobbs: so like you're missing function() {} around your alert
[21:38:23] <bobdobbs> ah
[21:38:28] <bobdobbs> thanks
[21:38:29] <gnarf> you're passing the return value of alert() to .each()
[21:38:32] <gnarf> which is an error
[21:38:33] <gnarf> :)
[21:38:51] <macuser> gnarf, could you help with mine also?
[21:39:34] <gnarf> macuser: its not even a (broken) working example - where is the accordion html / the a?
[21:39:39] <Sora_> hiya ppl
[21:39:41] <gnarf> macuser:  your selectors are totally wrong most likely
[21:39:47] <gnarf> the missing ' wont help either
[21:40:30] <macuser> yah sorry, it's in my code it has the ' just typed wrong in pastebin
[21:41:47] <macuser> no, the selectors are correct
[21:42:10] <macuser> is there something else i need to do to hide an accordion?
[21:42:19] <gnarf> so you have a <accordion1> tag?
[21:42:32] <macuser> i'll paste the html also
[21:45:19] <dr0id> yo coldhead
[21:45:28] <dr0id> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p92QfWOw88I
[21:45:45] <macuser> http://jsfiddle.net/LX3JK/1/ thats the HTML also
[21:47:33] <macuser> gnarf? i don't mean to be rude but would you mind checking my code?
[21:47:55] <gnarf> sorry i was talking about how wrong I am with coldhead
[21:48:16] <macuser> haha, no problem
[21:49:01] <gnarf> okay
[21:49:09] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Un5QX/
[21:49:27] <gnarf> a) you neeed the # in your selector to select by ID
[21:49:30] <gnarf> like CSS
[21:49:38] <gnarf> b) you should use jquery, not mootools
[21:49:53] <gnarf> c) you don't need two document ready handlers
[21:49:57] <gnarf> you can put them in one
[21:49:59] <Sora_> lol
[21:50:00] <Sora_> xD
[21:50:25] <gnarf> d) you're welcome - your selectors were totally wrong most likely
[21:50:44] <macuser> thank you so much, I can't believe i missed the no '#' and what was that about mootools?
[21:50:56] <gnarf> macuser: jsfiddle was including mootools, not jquery
[21:51:00] <gnarf> it has those options on the left
[21:51:06] <gnarf> so you can pick yer library
[21:51:29] <gnarf> its a REALLY powerful tool that jsfiddle
[21:51:38] <gnarf> play with it
[21:51:46] <macuser> will do, thanks again
[21:52:13] * gnarf winks @Sora_
[21:52:21] <gnarf> coldhead: nice track
[21:53:00] <zakdrizzt> In a jQuery object what's the easiest way to find if the object contains a specific key/index name?
[21:53:53] <gnarf> zakdrizzt: further define "key/index name" please
[21:53:57] * Sora_ with a beer in hand
[21:53:58] <gnarf> perhaps an example
[21:54:02] <Sora_> ^^;
[21:55:31] <zakdrizzt> http://pastebin.com/X0svGb8u as in finding "2:5-3:7" or "2:8-3:9" are indexes in that object
[21:55:43] <zakdrizzt> *finding out if
[21:56:14] <Sora_> in this format ?
[21:56:21] <Sora_> x:x-x:x
[21:56:25] <Sora_> ?
[21:56:50] <zakdrizzt> well in my particular case sure
[21:56:58] <Sora_> regex or json parse
[21:57:28] <zakdrizzt> there's no function to pass a string and object to and get a yes/no answer on if it exists in the object?
[21:58:43] <ndss56> !seen googleguy
[22:03:19] <zakdrizzt> would "objectname.[key_im_looking_for].size()" work?
[22:07:46] <ndss56> tias
[22:08:23] <Sora_> zakdrizzt: http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/Dvu8Z/
[22:10:01] <zakdrizzt> Sora_: man that looks painful
[22:10:31] <Sora_> regex or json
[22:11:00] <aro> is there a reason that an ajax response is coming back with a section of 'null'?
[22:11:37] <jsalot> So, I can use 'Attribute Contains Selector' method to match part of a string to elements attributes. But what if I have a long string I'm running a $.each() over and I want to match (best match) another part of a different string to one (or more) of the iterated value from the each loop?
[22:11:42] <jsalot> what would be the best method?
[22:12:17] * gnarf scratches head
[22:12:44] <zakdrizzt> any particular reason there isnt a built in function to compare property names lol?
[22:13:10] <gnarf> zakdrizzt: where is "2.8" contained
[22:13:11] <jsalot> sorry, I don't know if I posed the question clear enough :\
[22:13:14] <gnarf> is it in the ID?
[22:13:47] <zakdrizzt> it's just the equivalent of an associative array is all
[22:13:50] <Sora_> is a json only check if exist
[22:14:10] <zakdrizzt> with values being arrays themselves
[22:14:13] <Sora_> the second part http://jsfiddle.net/Sora/Dvu8Z/
[22:14:21] <Sora_> first with regex
[22:14:26] <Sora_> second with json
[22:14:31] <gnarf> zakdrizzt: a) never use the term "associative array" when talking about javascript
[22:14:33] <Sora_> u.u
[22:14:35] <gnarf> those are objects
[22:14:52] <gnarf> they have keys and values
[22:15:12] <Shazer2> omg.
[22:15:14] <zakdrizzt> yes i know that that's why i hadn't used that terminology till now
[22:15:18] <gnarf> but you have shown me some json, i don't know what this is looking for
[22:15:29] <gnarf> or what it is searching
[22:15:33] <gnarf> or why
[22:15:42] <zakdrizzt> i want to be able to search something that looks like that
[22:15:54] <gnarf> okay, what do you want to search for?
[22:15:57] <zakdrizzt> take a particular key
[22:16:07] <zakdrizzt> and see if it has a match in the json object
[22:16:27] <Sora_> lol
[22:16:30] <gnarf> do you want "2.8" to match both, and then have "3.8" only match the second?
[22:16:56] <gnarf> or sory 2:8
[22:16:56] <zakdrizzt> no the odd numbering crap is just a string for my own purposes lol
[22:17:02] <Sora_> xD
[22:17:03] <zakdrizzt> like i said before
[22:17:12] <zakdrizzt> just abstract to any string
[22:17:31] <Sora_> tan solo ve si existe la key
[22:17:33] <Sora_> json["2:5-3:7"]
[22:17:39] <gnarf> ?js var a = {"2:5-3:7":{"name":"hat01","url":null},"2:5-3:8":{"name":"hat02","url":null}}, str = "2:5-3:7"; a[str];

[22:18:28] <bot-t> zakdrizzt, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[22:18:30] <zakdrizzt> sorry if my weird naming
[22:18:38] <zakdrizzt> messed up the question
[22:18:43] <gnarf> thats not jQuery, thats just JavaScript
[22:18:52] <gnarf> what you meant to ask
[22:19:06] <gnarf> "How can I check if a property exists in an object given a string"
[22:19:21] <Sora_> gnarf you've earned a beer!!
[22:19:42] <gnarf> Sora_: i don't drink - but thx for the sentiment - give the beer to ajpiano ;)
[22:19:47] <Sora_> lol
[22:19:55] <gnarf> or coldhead
[22:19:58] <gnarf> if ajpiano is asleep
[22:20:05] <gnarf> coldhead could use a beer
[22:20:39] <zakdrizzt> well given a string which acts as the name of the propety
[22:20:42] <zakdrizzt> *property
[22:20:48] <zakdrizzt> yes thats what i was after
[22:21:02] <gnarf> okay- jsalot-- your question was way too vague - can you show me some code, and like comment out the areas you don't know how to write yet?
[22:26:06] <k1t> anyone know why i'm getting the error 'invalid label [Break On This Error] {"status":"conflict"}' when getting a JSON response on http://facebook.devoodle.com?

[22:26:48] <uptownben> Hey all
[22:27:35] <jsalot> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/ this has the ability to find the best match of an elements attribute value.. I kinda want this (see my above link), but with in an $.each, not for attribute values.
[22:28:57] <uptownben> quick q, I am pushing a jquery load in <head> via javascript ( using document.createElement("script");...etc. )I need for it to load in "noconflict" mode, how do I do that within that dynamic script load?
[22:31:43] <kasunLak> hi all, I am trying to get some JSON data from a different domain and using ajax but it's not working JSONP support too not there so what I can do in this scenario? Any help?
[22:32:13] <k1t> kasunLak: you have to use JSONP
[22:37:20] <jsalot> gnarf, duh.. I think I found my solution http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_match.asp for got all about match() lol.
[22:38:21] <LostyJai> kasunLak: Google Geocoding API?
[22:38:59] <uptownben> would I need to download the jquery.js file and modify it so it loads in noconflict mode?
[22:40:28] <kasunLak> LostyJai: No, it's not
[22:43:23] <LostyJai> kasunLak: when you figure it out, let me know
[22:43:49] <LostyJai> i how did it via php
[22:43:52] <LostyJai> just did a curl
[22:58:38] <cook1es_> here's an easy one for you guys.. if((pathname:contains('http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=239280')) == true){  getting error: missing ) in parenthetical ... any ideas?
[23:16:33] <janthony> Is there a way to get the URL of the page you are on with jquery/javascript? I know you can set it to a dom element and grab it from that, or you can do an ajax request and find it out from a php file, but are there any other ways?
