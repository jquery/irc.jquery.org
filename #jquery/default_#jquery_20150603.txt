[00:00:14] <skylo> hi , Can I add an character (e.g. " " - simple empty space) inside an <a> element , specifically before the closing tag?
[00:03:51] <Uhkis> yes you can
[00:04:14] <skylo> with str.replace?
[00:06:25] <Uhkis> for example
[00:07:44] <skylo> hmmm lets me explain fast whats what i wanna do. I have a div named stuff and I want every "</a>" to be " </a>". Do I use find("</a>").replace?
[00:09:24] <Uhkis> "named" ?
[00:09:25] <Uhkis> id?
[00:09:34] <Palmer11> seems like a flawed setup‚Ä¶ if oyu are searching an doc for every anchor
[00:09:40] <skylo> yeah sry , e.g. #stuff
[00:09:41] <Palmer11> only to add a space
[00:09:46] <Uhkis> let me make a fiddle for you skylo
[00:09:59] <skylo> that would be nice.
[00:11:25] <Uhkis> skylo: http://jsfiddle.net/heck7on0/1/
[00:12:17] <skylo> i will try this shortly
[00:14:13] <skylo> hmm it does not seem to work for me.
[00:14:25] <skylo> i merely copy pasted your code
[00:16:18] <skylo> aha
[00:16:36] <skylo> it does work, but not with an empty space as it seems.
[00:16:59] <Uhkis> huh?
[00:17:29] <skylo> maybe its my generator, which would by kinda strange, because as far as I know, jquery will be parsed after the rest is.
[00:34:39] <pauled> my userscript doesn't apply on that page with the pager where is Standing table http://en.lichess.org/tournament/VWiNgznq
[01:48:01] <onla> I'm trying to use document fragments, I guess, but I don't get how it works. So in sourc code of this page I would like to print to the page similarly as I put into console. I think I could append without that document fragments, but where I got this code the dude said that you can then print with doc fragments so I wonder view-source:http://at.kuhilasvaara.eu.org/imdb/
[03:45:03] <amharris> Hey, everyone. I've got an odd issue here.
[03:45:05] <amharris> I'm getting different value calculations between Unix-based systems and Windows [Linux and Mac achieve the same result, whereas Windows is problematic].
[03:45:07] <amharris> On the page - http://developmentmedia.net/staff - I'm performing the following jQuery: http://privatepaste.com/3aebf112ae
[03:45:31] <amharris> However, if you look on Chrome/Chromium/Opera/Firefox on a Linux-based system or a Mac, it should work fine, whereas many view more buttons don't appear on a Windows system [same browsers]. This appears to be due to the height calculation being incorrect.
[03:45:31] <amharris> If someone could let me know _why_ this is occurring and the solution to the issue, that would be much appreciated.
[03:45:31] <amharris> Cheers.
[03:55:31] <fairyrays> hey
[03:56:52] <fairyrays> I've searched but the keywords are over shadowed by basically stuff that does not belong .. does a jquery listbox like this exist some where? http://demos.devexpress.com/aspxeditorsdemos/ListEditors/MultiSelect.aspx
[03:58:47] <fairyrays> the overshadowing comes from 2 col uo lists
[03:59:47] <Xatenev> Cork: u here?
[04:08:28] <Uhkis> amharris: your html is totally broken, you may wanna fix that first
[04:10:36] <randomguy1> can't decide between case ben?
[04:10:36] <fairyrays> http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/styling-form-controls-revisited/select-multiple/ <-- yay found it after going ultra specifcal on googles ass ;)
[04:11:47] <amharris> Uhkis: What's totally broken with it? It may be a Drupal issue.
[04:12:22] <amharris> Uhkis: ...and as the project was handed to me initially, I didn't have the best base to work with.
[04:12:30] <Uhkis> amharris: starting from line #55
[04:17:21] <amharris> Uhkis: Mmmh; cheers. Seems that everything I was given was a bit broken. I invested quite a lot of time fixing the 'visibly destructive' problems.
[04:18:01] <Uhkis> welcome to the world of inherited projects :D
[04:18:02] <amharris> Uhkis: ...but I only have so much allowance to fix these problems. A lot of it comes back to 'getting the job done' but to a degree where the client doesn't moan about the costs.
[04:19:05] <amharris> Uhkis: How do clients often view things? If you tell them that there are a few bugs they'll never really notice but that fixing them cost them quite a lot of additonal money, when they're already at their limit, they won't be too pleased -- and they often have the attitude of 'if I don't notice, why should I care?'
[04:19:15] <amharris> Uhkis: Ignorance is an interesting thing, no? :P
[04:19:49] <amharris> Uhkis: ...and yes, it seems as though many issues are coming from Views within Drupal as well.
[04:21:51] <amharris> Uhkis: So, that aside, with the problem that I initially mentioned ...what ideas/thoughts do you have?
[04:22:08] <Uhkis> amharris: explaining to customers that "small bug" might some day lead to big bug usually makes them think
[04:23:13] <amharris> Uhkis: When your boss is out for X amount of hours in meetings and you haven't got permission to begin investing time in said fixes, also makes me think. ;)
[04:24:09] <randomguy1> your boss doesn't have email on his smart phone?
[04:24:13] <amharris> Uhkis: In a way, my boss is almost a client in the sense that I have to sell him the reasons behind solving the problem; but it's also a matter of client knowledge.
[04:24:39] <randomguy1> it's like a second appendage to my bosses, :D
[04:24:45] <amharris> randomguy1: He's out in meetings, so even if he's not far away in terms of distance, he'll be a few hours in the sense of being unavailable.
[04:26:33] <amharris> Uhkis, randomguy1: I'm going to head off for lunch and get some fresh air ...but if you wouldn't mind taking a look at the *key* problem in hand, that'd be great -- I'd really appreciate it.
[04:28:04] <randomguy1> came in later, dunno what the issue is
[04:33:59] <Uhkis> amharris|lunch: sorry, don't have a windows to test with
[04:34:44] <randomguy1> i see them not showing up
[04:34:57] <randomguy1> also see the nested html document inside the body of another html document
[04:35:15] <Uhkis> randomguy1: already mentioned that one
[04:35:26] <randomguy1> yeah, saw that
[04:35:30] <randomguy1> part
[04:37:12] <Uhkis> really bizarre problem
[04:38:18] <amharris> Uhkis: Ah, I just use VMs. :-)
[04:38:56] <Uhkis> amharris: well that might be the problem, have you tried with an actual pc?
[04:39:38] <amharris> Uhkis: Ah, I was thinking of adding on 'the client first reported the issue and then I replicated it with my VM; other Windows systems also have the issue.'
[04:39:42] <amharris> Uhkis: ;)
[04:42:46] <amharris> Uhkis: Something that may or may not be part of the issue is that Linux/Mac use the native WebKit rendering method for text, whereas Windows has a new system in Chrome for anti-aliased text, as ClearType isn't compatible with WebKit (and its derivatives), IIRC.
[04:43:09] <amharris> Uhkis: I recall Google implementing it ~6 or 7 major releases ago.
[04:43:44] <Uhkis> well, at least linux and font rendering is a ** mess :D
[04:44:13] <Uhkis> btw, your calcHeight is always null
[04:47:28] <Uhkis> amharris: var calcHeight = element.find('paragraph-wrapper').height();
[04:47:40] <Uhkis> amharris: should be .paragraph-wrapper
[04:51:02] <randomguy1> is there a squelch command?  i've long forgotten my irc lingo
[04:52:41] <amharris> Uhkis: Ooh, very true; good spot!
[04:57:52] <Uhkis> randomguy1: a what command
[04:58:33] <randomguy1> quelch/ignore
[04:59:08] <randomguy1> or a way to contact a mod for the nick rename spammer
[04:59:46] <Uhkis> i /ignored him
[05:00:28] <randomguy1> i tried /ignore and ignored and it said unknown command.  i'm using the web client if that makes a difference
[05:01:07] <amharris> randomguy1: Oh, wow, I wondered what the rainbow stream of colours was that happened to be flooding my screen. urgh!

[05:48:28] <notchris> Hello all
[05:49:15] <randomguy1> yo
[06:07:05] <nikhil_> hi notchris
[06:07:15] <nikhil_> or should i say;
[06:07:17] <notchris> nikhil_: How‚Äôs it going?
[06:07:25] <nikhil_> the man always preceeded by surprise: !chris
[06:12:44] <randomguy1> the real question is if he's notchris, who is he
[06:12:52] <randomguy1> or she
[06:24:00] <notchris> randomguy1: Lol
[06:31:44] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to get the src of the two iframe in here and then trying to get the link of the pdf file in each iframe, how can i do that ?, i tried attr but it didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/d180r10f/
[06:38:03] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a "gallery" slider plugin that is responsive/bootstrap  friendly? I have a gallery of images/boxes that I want to show 3  at a time (or whatever fits based on the browser width), and  need a way to cycle between them.  there are plenty of  slideshow plugins but most/all only handle one block/item at a time
[06:39:34] <Tennis> hey paulvd http://jsfiddle.net/d180r10f/1/ this any good ?
[06:40:11] <Tennis> hey tomasm have you checked out 'carousel
[06:40:53] <Tennis>  https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=carousel&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=vgNvVaO6KO6U7QbsvID4Cg#q=carousel+jquery
[06:42:33] <paulvd> Tennis: it just grabs the src of one, i need it for both, is there a .find all something?
[06:42:40] <Tennis> infact paulvd the only thing slightly off with yours was 'src' wasnt globally defined
[06:43:12] <delboy1978uk> tomasm-: you can use the standard bootstrap carousel for that. here‚Äôs a working example from a really bad looking site lol http://www.allagents.co.uk/choices/
[06:43:41] <Tennis> im a bit confused because the src contains 2 urls do you want the 2 urls from the 2 iframes making it 4 urls stored in 1 string?
[06:44:13] <paulvd> each iframe has one src, i want both src in a string or array, and then just get the pdf link from it
[06:44:58] <notchris> tomasm-: You should not use sliding content
[06:45:13] <notchris> tomasm-: It‚Äôs proven to be unaffective
[06:45:27] <notchris> ‚ÄúDeath to Sliders and Modals"
[06:45:37] <tomasm-> notchris, ok well i have some really long content, i want them to view all, but i can only take up one row  (because of other content). alternatives?
[06:46:07] <notchris> tomasm-: That sounds like a good time to use a ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù
[06:46:09] <tomasm-> delboy1978uk, ok well that seems to group 4  cols into each "item"
[06:46:23] <notchris> tomasm-: http://jedfoster.com/Readmore.js/
[06:47:01] <tomasm-> notchris, I'm familiar with that. I actually use  that in other places. this is just a set of pictures, so sliding seems to make sense
[06:47:18] <notchris> tomasm-: You should never use sliding content
[06:47:29] <notchris> tomasm-: Set up ‚ÄúLoad more photos"
[06:47:33] <Tennis> why do people disdain sliders
[06:47:33] <delboy1978uk> so if you want 3 items per slide you would use col-md-4, right? :)
[06:47:46] <delboy1978uk> i like a wee slider
[06:47:54] <delboy1978uk> some of them suck though
[06:48:01] <notchris> Tennis: They are statistically proven to be unaffective
[06:48:12] <notchris> Tennis: The preffered method of engagement is a Call to Action
[06:48:18] <tomasm-> notchris, ok well then what about ajax to replace what's in the box?
[06:48:29] <notchris> tomasm-: If you can make it look nice then yes
[06:48:44] <Tennis> statistically proven ? I'm reading about it and it sounds like from an advertisers perspective the research is conclucsive
[06:49:10] <notchris> Tennis: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[06:49:17] <notchris> Yes statistically proven.
[06:49:28] <Tennis> alone that means nothing
[06:49:33] <notchris> ‚Äú1% clicked a feature. Of those, 89% were the first position. 1% of clicks for the most significant object on the home page?"
[06:49:49] <tomasm-> delboy1978uk, ok well that page and that slider aren't the least bit responsive, so not something i can model after.
[06:50:29] <notchris> Tennis: Those are top web devs opinions, so it means something
[06:50:44] <Tennis> sure
[06:50:52] <Tennis> just have to question statistics you
[06:50:53] <Tennis> know
[06:50:57] <notchris> Absolutely
[06:51:21] <Tennis> im starting to agree though a little bit
[06:51:36] <Tennis> its kind like flashy for no reason
[06:51:45] <tomasm-> well at that point, I may as well load the whole list, limit it to one "row" (fixed height) and then have "more" and "previous" buttons that rearrange the cols (shift and push)
[06:51:46] <notchris> People cannot pay attention
[06:52:02] <notchris> Therefore sliders are inherently poor methods of targetting
[06:52:11] <notchris> also, the stats, but by human nature in general
[06:52:16] <notchris> This is more of a #design convo though
[06:52:40] <Tennis> they used a few additional sites
[06:52:40] <randomguy1> paulvd: http://jsfiddle.net/d180r10f/2/
[06:52:53] <delboy1978uk> tomasm-: like i said that site sucks, and i think its only on bootstrap 2. but you get the idea
[06:53:03] <Tennis> if i leave a page open and look at another one of my multi screens and a carousel shifts image it will catch my attention
[06:53:22] <Tennis> i always feel like ive missed something when they skipp to the next one and i scroll back
[06:54:12] <Tennis> it makes heaps of sense that the 1st image is the mosyt clicked too
[06:56:35] <tomasm-> I suppose the only reason to have a carousel  (versus just a "view more" link) is so it can animate.... these are a "featured listings" type of thing. as un-design-y as it is, the users might want it
[06:59:20] <delboy1978uk> lol, like the lame windows 8 thing with those sliders to make it look like things are happening
[06:59:58] <tomasm-> I dunno, not really familiar with windows 8
[07:00:39] <randomguy1> i like my pc to be a pc, not a large smartphone
[07:00:56] <delboy1978uk> win8 sucks
[07:01:30] <Tennis> win 10 i like alot
[07:01:47] <Tennis> but if they somehow make me pay for it after months of being on the beta edition i'll be upset
[07:01:52] <delboy1978uk> the mouse wheel scrolls the page sideways? who the hell were the ux/ui designers? i‚Äôd line them up against a wall and have them shot :-P
[07:18:06] <tomasm-> http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/ I think this  is what I'm looking for, it has a multi-column responsive ability
[07:30:15] <leporello> Hi. What is the usual topmost level in custom events?
[07:31:05] <leporello> body, html or something else? f.e. in my carousel component if i want to trigger event 'myScroll' i should use $('body').trigger('myScroll') ?
[07:32:58] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to print a google map into a div and add a marker when the map is clicked (only one marker). The map shows well buit the add marker function not. Any suggestion please? https://jsfiddle.net/4a8zpu5r/3/
[07:46:33] <leporello> mcfdez87, https://jsfiddle.net/ym7e768q/
[07:46:40] <leporello> anyway it doesn't place marker
[07:46:54] <mcfdez87> leporello, I solved introducing some code inside initialize function
[07:48:08] <leporello> mcfdez87, all code should be inside at least document.ready handler
[07:48:21] <leporello> or for some code in window.load even
[07:48:41] <amharris> mcfdez87: Just as a heads-up, if you don't it to be interactive, I recommend using Google's StaticMap API.
[07:50:18] <amharris> mcfdez87: You can still use custom markers and it's a nice way of scaling something that's an image, rather than a load of heavy JS. I like to make use of it in footers, have it wrapped in an achor so that when clicked on, it leads me to a contact/find us page with the full-bloat interactive map on there.
[07:50:59] <mcfdez87> ok leporello amharris , thank you!
[07:51:21] <gambl0re> what is the function doing? http://jsfiddle.net/r3dujavg/
[07:52:29] <amharris> mcfdez87: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/ ...and if you're lazy, there's this: http://staticmapmaker.com/google/ ;)
[07:52:44] <mcfdez87> thanks!
[07:53:10] <amharris> mcfdez87: Just keep in mind that there are more extensive options by modifying the full URL and handling API changes there.
[07:53:46] <amharris> mcfdez87: So, for server usage, I recommend storing the custom marker on there and then referencing that. :-)
[07:53:47] <gambl0re> guys, what is the purpose of the second parameter?
[07:54:15] <shoky> gambl0re: 2nd parameter is the old value of the attribute, in case you want to use it to create the new value. it's not used in this example
[07:54:44] <amharris> shoky, gambl0re: Indeed. It's beinh held within that function, so within that scope it can be reused.
[07:55:50] <gambl0re> i still dont understand. we're selecting the "a"  element within the "div class = chapter"
[07:56:14] <shoky> gambl0re: you're selecting ALL a elements within ALL div.chapter's
[07:56:17] <gambl0re> it assigns the rel and title attributes to the "a" element.
[07:56:24] <shoky> gambl0re: each of those a element might have a differnt old-value of the id attribute
[07:56:56] <gambl0re> put what is the value of index, oldValue?
[07:57:08] <gambl0re> but not put
[07:57:27] <shoky> gambl0re: for the first a element, index will be 0. for the 2nd element, it will be 1. etc.  the id will be whatever the previous id of those elements was
[07:57:58] <shoky> oldValue is the previous id, i mean
[07:58:29] <gambl0re> but how can you tell that the index is 0? there are no arguments being passed to the function
[07:58:50] <shoky> gambl0re: jquery passes those 2 arguments into the function..
[07:59:24] <gambl0re> let say there are 5 "a" elemtents in the div class=chapter...
[07:59:32] <gambl0re> it selects all "a" elements....
[07:59:34] <shoky> oks. then the function will be called 5 times
[07:59:54] <gambl0re> starting from the first "a" element it finds, its index = 0?
[07:59:57] <shoky> yes
[08:00:09] <gambl0re> but how does the function know that?
[08:00:20] <shoky> the first is 0. what is there to know?
[08:00:46] <gambl0re> you're not understanding what i'm trying to say..
[08:00:50] <shoky> nope
[08:01:02] <gambl0re> i understand arrays start from 0,1,2,3 etc...
[08:01:10] <gambl0re> but this is not an array..
[08:01:16] <shoky> it is array-like
[08:01:21] <shoky> jquery collections are like arrays
[08:02:06] <shoky> but that doesnt matter much.. jquery just calls the function, once per element, each time, it increases the index by 1. it's simple
[08:02:21] <shoky> just like if you do   $(..).each(function(index, val) { .... })
[08:02:34] <shoky> in this case the .attr  is doing an .each for you inside
[08:02:52] <shoky> because jquery made it do that, for convenience
[08:03:11] <gambl0re> so it selects all the "a" elements in the div. starts with the first "a" element it finds, it has an index = 0, second "a" element has index =1
[08:03:23] <gambl0re> so it loops through each "a" element?
[08:03:28] <shoky> yes
[08:03:33] <gambl0re> and assigns its value?
[08:03:38] <gambl0re> id value?
[08:03:41] <shoky> yes
[08:04:37] <gambl0re> does this function work the same on all attributes? for example if i ran the function on the title attribute isntead
[08:04:51] <shoky> ye
[08:04:59] <gambl0re> and whats the purpose of the oldValue?
[08:05:07] <gambl0re> why is it even there..
[08:05:10] <shoky> if you want the new value to be dependent on the old value..
[08:05:37] <gambl0re> wtf..
[08:05:55] <shoky> lets say you want to add  "bla"  to whatever the old id was, for each of those <a>'s
[08:06:19] <shoky> you'd do   .attr({id: function(i, oldValue) { return oldValue + "bla" })
[08:06:31] <shoky> so id would change  from "foo"  to "foobla"
[08:06:32] <shoky> etc
[08:06:39] <BillCriswell> foobla!
[08:06:43] <BillCriswell> Fun to say.
[08:06:45] <shoky> plox
[08:07:44] <gambl0re> so the first parameter refers to the index position??
[08:07:49] <gambl0re> of that element?
[08:07:53] * shoky sighs
[08:08:01] <gambl0re> yo man, this is messed up
[08:08:02] <shoky> yes
[08:08:32] <shoky> the docs mention all of this, btw
[08:08:39] <shoky> `api .attr
[08:08:40] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[08:08:48] <shoky> fudge
[08:09:00] <BillCriswell> jerk bot.
[08:09:05] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[08:09:45] <gambl0re> if i did id: function(x,y) {"hello" +x} ...what would the
[08:09:50] <gambl0re> x represent?
[08:10:03] <shoky> argument names don't matter
[08:10:03] <gambl0re> on the selector div.chapter a
[08:10:09] <shoky> x would be the index. y would be the old value
[08:10:21] <gambl0re> thats what i said before.
[08:10:28] <shoky> ok
[08:10:31] <gambl0re> first parameter is the index position.
[08:10:39] <shoky> and i said yes.. no?
[08:10:52] <gambl0re> you did that "sigh" action..
[08:10:59] <shoky> and then said yes :)
[08:11:23] <fairyrays> carousels lool
[08:12:02] * fairyrays hits a horse whom is attached to a pole on a cog with large hammer made from stone
[08:12:28] <gambl0re> ok thanks..
[08:12:42] <shoky> no probs
[08:13:30] <ekhidna> Hello everyone. I'd like you to answer a question please, hope this is the right place. I need to make a demo to a painting company so the user can Paint walls, floor, etc with different colors. Is it possible to do it with jquery or any plugin? I also looked at Raphaeljs but it is more for drawing. It hasn't have to be with jquery. If someone know of any plugin, I'd be glad. Thank you.
[08:22:18] <BillCriswell> ekhidna: Just a static room?
[08:23:23] <ekhidna> yes Bill. It's with static images
[08:24:15] <ekhidna> we had one made in flash but it's too heavy. But know movement doesn't count, we just want to colorize wall, floor, ceiling in static images
[08:24:22] <HoNgOuRu> how do I get the color chosen from a input type=color ?
[08:25:11] <robertmaxrees> .val() HoNgOuRu
[08:25:14] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[08:27:36] <amharris> ekhidna: Just to ask, though the UX would be a _lot_ more complicated to handle, is it supposed to work on mobile devices as well [smartphones, tablets]?
[08:29:58] <ekhidna> yes. that's also the point i forgot to tell. Since you don't use flash in mobile we are doing this so that people in mobiles also can use
[08:31:14] <amharris> ekhidna: Right... so this needs to be light as well...
[08:31:36] <ekhidna> yes, you're absolutly right
[08:31:40] <amharris> ekhidna: Damn, I wish my JS knowledge was a lot better. Errr... I pulled up an article a couple of days ago about really useful jQuery and JS libraries. One moment.
[08:31:57] <robertmaxrees> lol "jquery and js libraries"
[08:33:18] <amharris> robertmaxrees: I know ...it was badly worded. ;)
[08:34:03] <ekhidna> not much i think. jquery is a js library as there are others
[08:34:13] <amharris> ekhidna: Please keep one thing in mind; pure JS is going to run quite a lot faster without jQuery sitting there as a middle-man interpreter [depending on what components of the language one is using].
[08:34:22] <randomguy1> robert was snickering at the redundancy
[08:34:23] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[08:34:33] <robertmaxrees> amharris that's not entirely accurate.
[08:34:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do middle-man "interpreting"
[08:34:43] <amharris> robertmaxrees: Feel free to correct me. :-)
[08:34:58] <robertmaxrees> and there are a lot of basic things you can do to ensure that you don't jump of the poor perf. train.
[08:35:01] <amharris> robertmaxrees: I'm probably the noobiest person around here, so it's better that I'm corrected than not.
[08:35:15] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[08:35:32] <robertmaxrees> also, as a rule with JS - don't prematurely optimize.
[08:36:03] <amharris> robertmaxrees: I did say depending on parts of the language. ;) ...and yes, of course one can always right better code. ...but still, raw JS will be faster -- it's just a matter of how much, right?
[08:36:24] <robertmaxrees> go for readability.
[08:36:25] <amharris> robertmaxrees: ...and the pain of writing A LOT of code in it, if one isn't comfortable in doing so.
[08:36:25] <robertmaxrees> always.
[08:36:28] <gambl0re> insertAfter() and .after() does the samething except the syntax is arranged differently same as .append() and appendTo()?
[08:36:41] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re the docs tell you as much :)
[08:36:47] <randomguy1> amharris: also roi on your effort
[08:36:59] <ekhidna> I guess I'll try make the draws with Raphaeljs as well painting them also. But thank you for you're time
[08:37:00] <amharris> robertmaxrees: Readability, always; unless one is opting for a perf-focused tech demo for themselves. :P
[08:37:14] <robertmaxrees> amharris those demos are rarely useful.
[08:37:35] <robertmaxrees> jsperf is great to make a point, so long as you remember that those points are totally out of context and have no bearing on reality :)
[08:39:13] <Phibonacci> Hello. I'm new to jQuery (and most of web techs). I'm using DataTables plugin and I would like to be able to to set the lines of my table with input chans when clicking on a button. The data would be sent to the server, and the line would refresh (so the input chan would eventualy disappear and be replace by the text if the input was valid).
[08:39:30] <Phibonacci> Could you give me the global method to achieve this ?
[08:39:33] <robertmaxrees> "input chan"?
[08:39:50] <amharris> robertmaxrees: Useful wasn't so much my point. I was going from the angle of 'hey, I want to build a bleeding-edge, fast-as-possible app for myself'. For production, hell no; of course, I absolutely agree with you there. ...and even with most of my own projects, I wouldn't dare opt against readability as a first.
[08:40:02] <Phibonacci> <input/>
[08:40:32] <amharris> ekhidna: http://noeticforce.com/Javascript-libraries-for-svg-animation -- you may find a library here that could come in handy. Raphael is one of the ones listed.
[08:40:43] <amharris> ekhidna: That's the post I mentioned earlier.
[08:40:45] <robertmaxrees> Phibonacci you mean an input element?  that's pretty easy - there's no "universal method" to do it, but the concept is pretty basic.
[08:40:56] <randomguy1> Phibonacci: so a row has inputs and you click a button, it gets validated on the back end, and if valid they get changed to just plain text?
[08:41:03] <robertmaxrees> Phibonacci check out .on(), $.ajax(), and .html()
[08:41:37] <robertmaxrees> Phibonacci we're not going to GIVE you the code, but we can help you write it :)
[08:41:48] <ekhidna> I'll have a look. Thank you amharris
[08:41:50] <Phibonacci> The client side is working well but I have no idea how I should handle the send/get of the informations.
[08:41:58] <Phibonacci> Oh, I don't want the code, I'm just lost.
[08:42:07] <robertmaxrees> Phibonacci $.ajax() is how you send data
[08:42:22] <Phibonacci> I'll have a look at that. Thank you.
[09:32:10] <paulvd> how can i get the values of this .map array as a string, something like foreach in php and then save it in another array ? http://jsfiddle.net/d180r10f/2/
[09:33:38] <gambl0re> guy's i dont understand this code. please help. how does line 5 of the jquery code work? http://jsfiddle.net/j50xdt2s/
[09:33:40] <gambl0re> thanks
[09:35:35] <Mo0O> gambl0re: what you don't understatnd in this code? it add the footer's notes
[09:36:08] <NoiseEee> its hard to understand code that has no formatting.
[09:36:46] <gambl0re> $(this).appendTo($notes).wrap('<li></li>');
[09:37:09] <gambl0re> i dont know, i just copied/pasted the code
[09:37:13] <Mo0O> gambl0re: did you use each method before?
[09:37:38] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: so... append $this to the DOM node $notes and wrap it in <li> tags.
[09:37:41] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re check the docs. it's pretty clear.
[09:37:59] <Mo0O> gambl0re: https://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:38:06] <robertmaxrees> append $(this) to $(notes) - and wrap it in an li tag.
[09:38:09] <gambl0re> i know what the .each method does and i know how the appendTo works but im not sure how the span.footnote is appending to the ol
[09:38:15] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: http://api.jquery.com/appendto/ http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[09:38:35] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: $notes is an <ol>
[09:38:54] <gambl0re> shouldnt it be <ol>.....</ol><span class="footnote"></span> since it is appending
[09:38:55] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you said you know how appendTo() works but you don't know how things are getting appended?
[09:38:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:39:12] <gambl0re> append adds it to the end of an element
[09:39:12] <Mo0O> paulvd: https://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:39:22] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re no... the docs are pretty clear.
[09:39:25] <gambl0re> not in between...
[09:39:38] <Mo0O> 2 questions one answer \o/
[09:39:44] <robertmaxrees> appendTo() appends an element to another.  you're thinking of insertAfter()
[09:39:58] <robertmaxrees> the examples are very clear about what's going on.
[09:40:25] <gambl0re> if i did $('p').appendTo('div') then it would append all p elements at the end of each div
[09:40:34] <Mo0O> no
[09:40:42] <Mo0O> hmm yes
[09:40:47] <Mo0O> ;D
[09:40:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:40:54] <robertmaxrees> read the docs - it says as much.
[09:40:59] <Mo0O> +1
[09:41:11] <gambl0re> no, yes, no?
[09:41:13] <Mo0O> yes
[09:41:28] <robertmaxrees> yes'
[09:41:49] <paulvd> how can i get the values of this .map array as a string, something like foreach in php and then save it in another array ? http://jsfiddle.net/d180r10f/2/
[09:41:57] <Mo0O> gambl0re: jquery documentation is very well done, please read it before
[09:42:07] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re http://i.imgur.com/vqMtyiP.png
[09:42:15] <robertmaxrees> straight from http://api.jquery.com/appendto/
[09:42:40] <Mo0O> paulvd: use vanilla JS
[09:42:53] <robertmaxrees> paulvd .get().join(); after
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get a comma separated list?
[09:43:14] <Mo0O> http://vanilla-js.com/
[09:44:18] <robertmaxrees> Mo0O he's only using jquery to get the properties from the elements.
[09:44:18] <paulvd> robertmaxrees: my main aim is to get the url of the pdf file in those values, and then use each of them as a link
[09:44:18] <robertmaxrees> then you want an array, not a string.
[09:44:18] <gambl0re> i just read the docs...it still doesnt answer my question.
[09:44:18] <Mo0O> robertmaxrees: vanilla JS is 100% compatible with jquery‚Ä¶
[09:44:24] <robertmaxrees> Mo0O correct.  you're conflating his question ;)
[09:44:28] <Uhkis> :-D
[09:44:40] <robertmaxrees> there's a quirk with how you get arrays out of jquery's .map() calls.
[09:44:43] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: what question
[09:44:48] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: $notes is an <ol>
[09:45:01] <paulvd> yes thats what i asked, i want to manipulate each item and extract the pdf link from that, and then create another array with those two links only
[09:45:02] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i just showed you a screenshot that literally answers a question you just asked.
[09:45:27] <gambl0re> $( "<p>Test</p>" ).appendTo( ".inner" ); but why does the p element get inserted inside the div element?
[09:45:31] <gambl0re> and not after?
[09:46:11] <randomguy1> gambl0re: i think you want insertAfter()
[09:46:25] <paulvd> ok first, how do i make an array with js lol?
[09:46:34] <gambl0re> oh wait....appendTo inserts it at the end of an element but inside of it.
[09:47:09] <randomguy1> paulvd: sources.toArray()
[09:48:17] <gambl0re> $( "<p>Test</p>" ).appendTo( ".inner" );.....the p element gets inserted inside the class .inner and following p elements gets added after the previous p element inside the div?
[09:48:28] <gambl0re> i mean inside the .inner clas
[09:48:48] <randomguy1> gambl0re: yes
[09:48:59] <randomguy1> gambl0re: append is "at the end"
[09:49:17] <Mo0O> by oposition to prepend
[09:49:27] <gambl0re> i got it mixed with .after
[09:49:32] <paulvd> randomguy1: var sources = sources.toArray(); ??
[09:49:49] <gambl0re> guys, i just want to thank you.
[09:50:05] <randomguy1> paulvd: sources, as it stands in your fiddle, can be turned into a basic array with sources.toArray().  whatever you want to do with it at that point is up to you
[09:50:09] <Munger> Hello. I am trying to delete all the rows in this chart that have a numeric value in the "LW" volume - http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart. What is the best way to select all items with class "last-week" that contain a numeric value?
[09:51:54] <Munger> My bad. This is the correct URL - http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/
[09:52:36] <randomguy1> Munger: you can do a non standard filter.  $('.last-week').filter(function(){ return this.value == "whatever matcher"; })
[09:52:56] <robertmaxrees> paulvd you can also do http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d180r10f/4/
[09:53:05] <robertmaxrees> .get() convers the results of a jquery .map() to an array.
[09:54:05] <Munger> randomguy1, Thanks. Given that, I then need to delete the parent <tr>. Can I simply call this.parent.remove() ?
[09:54:17] <randomguy1> $(this).closest('tr')
[09:54:36] <randomguy1> or parent() if you know it will always be a direct decendent
[09:54:38] <Munger> randomguy1, Oooh. That's nice :)
[09:56:11] <robertmaxrees> i always opt for .closest() just in case, personally.
[09:56:17] <randomguy1> yup
[09:56:25] <randomguy1> less fragile
[09:59:03] <paulvd> randomguy1: how can i use for each with them now
[09:59:23] <robertmaxrees> paulvd it's an array.
[09:59:39] <robertmaxrees> whateverYourArrayIs.forEach()
[09:59:45] <randomguy1> paulvd: basic array forEach(function(elem){ /* do whatever with elem */ });
[10:01:01] <randomguy1> paulvd: though you could use .each() on the map returned without having to convert it to a basic array, *shrug*
[10:01:28] <randomguy1> whatever floats your boat
[10:03:44] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, robertmaxrees Hi
[10:03:51] <randomguy1> hola
[10:03:56] <robertmaxrees> yo
[10:04:06] <HoNgOuRu> hey...
[10:04:13] <HoNgOuRu> hablan espaÒol ?
[10:04:23] <randomguy1> muy poco
[10:04:27] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:04:41] <HoNgOuRu> do you live hear at freenode ?
[10:04:42] <HoNgOuRu> hehe
[10:04:45] <HoNgOuRu> here*
[10:04:51] <randomguy1> i hang out in here while at work
[10:05:05] <HoNgOuRu> I see...
[10:05:22] <robertmaxrees> lots of us do.
[10:05:26] <HoNgOuRu> lol
[10:05:38] <randomguy1> you can learn alot just by observing other people's issues and solutions
[10:05:52] <HoNgOuRu> I am following some tutorials about jquery
[10:05:55] <HoNgOuRu> on youtub
[10:05:56] <HoNgOuRu> e
[10:06:17] <HoNgOuRu> anyways, the best way of learning is when you try to accomplish something
[10:06:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out learn.jquery.com
[10:06:43] <randomguy1> i'd agree (with both of you)
[10:06:45] <HoNgOuRu> Every time I google jquery I end up at learn.jquery.com
[10:06:59] <robertmaxrees> there's a good reason for that ;)
[10:07:21] <HoNgOuRu> I am trying to get a table working
[10:07:25] <HoNgOuRu> for crud operations
[10:07:34] <HoNgOuRu> Its a bit challenging
[10:07:46] <HoNgOuRu> for begginning coding in jquery
[10:07:51] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[10:07:54] <HoNgOuRu> I know
[10:07:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a langauge :D
[10:07:59] <HoNgOuRu> I KNOW
[10:08:08] <robertmaxrees> no need to yell.
[10:08:10] <HoNgOuRu> I was going to correct it
[10:08:12] <HoNgOuRu> hehe
[10:08:47] <randomguy1> what do you mean table?
[10:08:54] <robertmaxrees> datatable i'm guessing.
[10:08:57] <HoNgOuRu> table, rows, columns
[10:09:08] <rtb_> hello there: anyone can help me with this jQuery.validate()? http://jsfiddle.net/okxu49j9/
[10:09:16] <robertmaxrees> HoNgOuRu you realize you need a serverside setup, too, right?
[10:09:18] <randomguy1> right, i guess i'm missing the connector between a html table and crud operations...
[10:09:33] <HoNgOuRu> robertmaxrees, yes, I have the serverside coded
[10:09:37] <rtb_> it seems not to work in my chromium and firefox
[10:10:13] <randomguy1> your planning on having a table that, through events, invokes crud operations?
[10:10:39] <HoNgOuRu> I only want to be able to click a column and transform the text into an input with that text for modify and transform back to text after hitting enter, that will make the update
[10:11:04] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, just modifying the tds, after Ill send an ajax request
[10:11:14] <randomguy1> k, so what's your first problem?
[10:11:27] <HoNgOuRu> Im stuck with one thing
[10:11:46] <HoNgOuRu> I have the table displayed...
[10:11:52] <HoNgOuRu> with rows, and data fileld
[10:11:56] <HoNgOuRu> filled*
[10:12:02] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle if you can :)
[10:12:20] <HoNgOuRu> after I click a td
[10:12:30] <HoNgOuRu> it transforms into an input type=text
[10:12:38] <randomguy1> k
[10:12:44] <HoNgOuRu> and it is initialized with the same text as before
[10:12:51] <HoNgOuRu> for modify
[10:13:04] <HoNgOuRu> I can change the text...
[10:13:05] <robertmaxrees> HoNgOuRu could you maybe setup a jsfiddle of this instead of typing out the entire thing like this?
[10:13:14] <HoNgOuRu> ok robertmaxrees
[10:13:17] <HoNgOuRu> sorry
[10:13:31] <robertmaxrees> it's okay, it'll just be faster that way :)
[10:14:47] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ i assume you're trying to validate on blue?
[10:14:50] <robertmaxrees> *blur
[10:15:52] <rtb_> robertmaxrees , yes this and the required message should also be visible when typing something and then erasing the box
[10:17:01] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ you have to explicitly check if the form is valid()
[10:17:23] <rtb_> ... well :)
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> well what?
[10:17:35] <gambl0re> guys i need your help again...please. what is the line doing?             $(this).before(['<sup>', index + 1, '</sup>'].join('')).appendTo($notes).wrap('<li></li>');
[10:17:43] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re please go to the docs.
[10:17:51] <gambl0re> $(this).before(['<sup>', index + 1, '</sup>'].join('')).appendTo($notes).wrap('<li></li>');
[10:18:09] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re please come up with a more specific question.
[10:18:15] <gambl0re> what does the [] do inside the .before() brackets.
[10:18:17] <gambl0re> thanks..
[10:18:23] <randomguy1> that's an array
[10:18:39] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ $('input').on('blur', function() { console.log($('#yourForm').valid()) });
[10:18:58] <gambl0re> yes...
[10:19:06] <robertmaxrees> it's creating an array and joining it.
[10:19:42] <robertmaxrees> what do you think that's doing?
[10:20:13] <gambl0re> it goes through each span class="footnote"
[10:21:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:21:21] <gambl0re> and it adds that array code before the (this)
[10:21:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ['<sup>', index + 1, '</sup>'].join('') - what do you think .join('') does here?
[10:22:07] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, thanks very much for looking into it! :)
[10:22:16] <gambl0re> joins array elements seperated by a space!
[10:22:21] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ sure - get the basic idea?
[10:22:33] <rtb_> yes got it :-)
[10:23:53] <delboy1978uk> what woulkd i do to say run this when the window has been resized?
[10:24:07] <randomguy1> $.resize()
[10:24:15] <delboy1978uk> $(window).on()‚Ä¶ ah cool
[10:24:24] <rtb_> robermaxrees, but: all the infos on jQuery.validator have never used listener setup, everything seemed to work out of the box -- just with validate()
[10:24:35] <delboy1978uk> $(window).resize(function(){  //etc }); ?
[10:24:38] <rtb_> robermaxrees
[10:24:45] <rtb_> robertmaxrees
[10:24:49] <randomguy1> yup
[10:24:51] <delboy1978uk> thanks randomguy1
[10:25:38] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ right - that validates when you submit.
[10:25:56] <gambl0re> $(this).before(['<sup>', index + 1, '</sup>'].join('')) .... this line joins the array elements and so becomes <sup>index+1</sup> and puts it before the (this)
[10:26:15] <gambl0re> (this) = span.footnote
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re sort of, yeah.
[10:26:26] <gambl0re> what do you mean sort of?
[10:26:33] <gambl0re> what am i doing wrong?
[10:26:34] <robertmaxrees> index + 1 will output a number.
[10:26:48] <gambl0re> yes i know...
[10:26:51] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[10:26:55] <robertmaxrees> just making sure we're clear :)
[10:26:59] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, yeah right...thx!
[10:27:00] <gambl0re> but did i understand the general idea?
[10:27:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:27:08] <gambl0re> ok good...thanks
[10:27:22] <gambl0re> there was actually no space in the .join
[10:27:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:29:07] <dopie> hey guys I'm trying to figure this out I'm trying to check if #textarea is blank
[10:29:13] <dopie> how would I write that?
[10:29:23] <robertmaxrees> dopie how do you think?
[10:29:49] <randomguy1> what does 'blank' mean? ;)
[10:29:50] <gambl0re> if statement
[10:29:52] <robertmaxrees> $('#textarea').val().length
[10:29:57] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[10:30:30] <robertmaxrees> if (!$('#textarea').val().length) { console.log('yo, this is empty') }
[10:30:55] <randomguy1> assuming you don't care about whitespace, :D
[10:31:07] <robertmaxrees> meh.
[10:31:23] <robertmaxrees> you could do a .val().trim() if you really wanted to.
[10:31:33] <dopie> what does !$ mean?
[10:31:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:31:42] <randomguy1> not operator
[10:31:47] <robertmaxrees> ! means "not"
[10:31:57] <dopie> correct
[10:32:00] <dopie> and $
[10:32:02] <robertmaxrees> so $('#textarea').val().length returns the length of the value
[10:32:07] <robertmaxrees> $ is the jquery function.
[10:32:14] <robertmaxrees> so !$ isn't what you care about.
[10:33:10] <robertmaxrees> the $('#textarea').val().length will return a number, so it's !0 or !14 or whatever the number is.
[10:33:12] <delboy1978uk> not jquery?
[10:33:24] <delboy1978uk> ah of course
[10:33:25] <delboy1978uk> lol
[10:33:53] <arc_> do you need length? won't it work without that?
[10:33:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:34:00] <robertmaxrees> well, actually, yeah.
[10:34:01] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[10:34:08] <robertmaxrees> because empty strings are falsy.
[10:34:09] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, but: if you have a look at the video at http://jqueryvalidation.org/ -- it seems very clear: there should be instant feedback when writing to an input box and then deleting the input -- and this is quite preferable
[10:34:11] <robertmaxrees> arc_++
[10:34:13] <delboy1978uk> so would !$(document).ready() run before the doc is ready? :P
[10:34:19] <randomguy1> no
[10:34:21] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk nope.
[10:34:31] <delboy1978uk> lol sorry just being stupid
[10:34:36] <robertmaxrees> that'll run doc ready and then negate the return.
[10:35:08] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ not going to watch 12 minutes to see your point.
[10:36:47] <dopie> if (!$('#personal_health_information_allergy_list'.trim).val().length) { console.log('yo, this is empty') }
[10:36:53] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:36:54] <dopie> would the trim work where i put it?
[10:36:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:37:04] <dopie> hmmmmm
[10:37:06] <robertmaxrees> it's a method.
[10:37:11] <robertmaxrees> and would need to be on .val()
[10:37:25] <dopie> if (!$('#personal_health_information_allergy_list').val().trim.length) { console.log('yo, this is empty') }
[10:37:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a method.
[10:37:33] <robertmaxrees> needs ()
[10:37:34] <robertmaxrees>  if (!$('#personal_health_information_allergy_list').val().trim()) { console.log('yo, this is empty') }
[10:37:37] <dopie> argh
[10:37:38] <robertmaxrees> no need for the .length, btw.
[10:37:54] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, sorry didn't to bother you, just give evidence; also you can read it here: there is instant feedback, see http://jqueryvalidation.org/reference/ @ validation event
[10:38:26] <randomguy1> i'm lost.  what is rtb_ 's issue?
[10:38:37] <robertmaxrees> he's having issues with the default behavior of jquery validate.
[10:38:52] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ dunno then.
[10:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and rtb_  - "By default, forms are validated on submit, triggered by the user clicking the submit button or pressing enter when a form input is focused (option onsubmit)."
[10:39:39] <dopie> robertmaxrees, i see what you're saying now
[10:39:41] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, next paragraph
[10:39:44] <dopie> figuring it out
[10:39:57] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ huh?
[10:40:17] <robertmaxrees> rtb_ you're convoluting the docs it looks like.
[10:40:17] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, a bit under the sentence you read
[10:41:04] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, "When the user enters something invalid into a valid field, it is also validated when the field loses focus (option onblur)."
[10:41:09] <robertmaxrees> in all my experience with jqvalidate, i've had to set all that up manually.
[10:41:26] <robertmaxrees> if you have an issue with the docs, by all means contact the author.
[10:42:05] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, invalid input is then also writing some to a box and then deleting
[10:42:31] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, thanks again for your reflection, just wanted to point it out
[10:42:33] <robertmaxrees> iirc that functionality only works after the initial submit, but i could have that wrong /shrug.
[10:42:49] <robertmaxrees> i've used jqvalidate a lot, so I guess i'm used to some of those quirks.
[10:43:00] <rtb_> robertmaxrees, :)
[10:43:37] <robertmaxrees> it may also be that the docs don't reflect the most recent version.
[10:45:30] <paulvd> how can i remove data-target="#value" from an anchor link?
[10:46:00] <robertmaxrees> .data('target', '');
[10:46:38] <arc_> this is a bit off topic but there are lots of tech-minded people here so i figure maybe somebody will have some insight. i know a lot about displays, but i've never been able to understand why an image that looks fine on a ~100 dpi display will look like absolute dogshit on a ~300 dpi display, even if it's being shown in a physically smaller area
[10:46:57] <arc_> shouldn't it just look basically like it does on the lower dpi display?
[10:47:14] <robertmaxrees> http://www.vsellis.com/understanding-dpi-resolution-and-print-vs-web-images/
[10:47:16] <arc_> it doesn't make sense to me that an image would require higher resolution to look the same
[10:47:33] <robertmaxrees> also: display quality plays a part.
[10:47:37] <robertmaxrees> TN vs IPs, etc.
[10:48:28] <arc_> i can see why you would say that, but i know enough to know whether the problem i'm talking about would be caused by that
[10:48:37] <arc_> it's just about scaling
[10:48:58] <robertmaxrees> i've never seen the particular proble you're talking about then.
[10:52:11] <arc_> hm maybe chrome mobile just does a lower quality scale to save power
[10:52:40] <arc_> but i have also noticed the same issue in the new imgur app
[10:53:01] <robertmaxrees> so you're comparing your phone to your desktop?
[10:53:10] <arc_> yeah
[10:53:36] <robertmaxrees> they're probably doing device detection and shipping you a lower quality image.
[10:53:39] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[10:53:51] <Absolute0> What does .bind(this) do in $.ajax({ ... success: function () {}.bind(this) ...}); ?
[10:53:53] <arc_> that's garbage though. i need a higher quality image : /
[10:54:04] <robertmaxrees> not garbage at all, arc_
[10:54:15] <Absolute0> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#updating-state
[10:54:27] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 sets the function context so uses of "this" inside that callback reference the right object.
[10:54:48] <Absolute0> ah, is that a js feature and not a jquery feature?
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:55:00] <Absolute0> so why is it in the docs?
[10:55:04] <Absolute0> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[10:55:09] <robertmaxrees> different bind.
[10:55:12] <Absolute0> "An object containing data that will be passed to the event handler."
[10:55:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:55:18] <robertmaxrees> different bind.
[10:55:20] <Absolute0> oh
[10:55:22] <Absolute0> nevermind
[10:55:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects have a .bind()
[10:55:27] <robertmaxrees> there's also a javascript .bind()
[10:55:38] <robertmaxrees> since jquery doesn't extend native prototypes, you
[10:55:48] <robertmaxrees> *you're looking at Function.prototype.bind
[10:56:08] <Absolute0> robertmaxrees: yes, they were using jquery so I thought it's jquery-related
[10:56:25] <robertmaxrees> i figured :) just telling you how to see the difference in the future :)
[10:56:29] <dopie> ok i got a follow up question
[10:56:57] <randomguy1> shoot
[10:57:09] <Absolute0> robertmaxrees: would it be "messy" to save this as a variable instead of using bind?
[10:57:10] <dopie> if #foo value is blank when submitted, change #foo value to 'test'
[10:57:18] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 i think it's messy personally.
[10:57:26] <robertmaxrees> you have a tool to control context - use it.
[10:57:35] <dopie> I use the .submit
[10:57:37] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery val
[10:57:37] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .val() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:57:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ dopie
[10:57:52] * Absolute0 loves when programmers get opinionated
[10:58:16] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 just usin' the toolkit :D
[10:59:59] <Absolute0> is .ajax({cache:false}) also required when uploading files? If so why?
[11:00:18] <robertmaxrees> don't think so.
[11:00:28] <Absolute0> I remember doing some hacks for file uploads...
[11:00:31] <randomguy1> i'm pretty sure my file upload doesn't use that
[11:00:52] <robertmaxrees> unless IE's excessive spec following carries over.
[11:01:10] <Absolute0> nevermind: processData: "false,contentType: false," is what I did.
[11:01:24] <Absolute0> " processData: false,contentType: false,"
[11:02:54] <Absolute0> Is it a bad idea to poll for data at a scheduled interval instead of using something like socket.io?
[11:03:11] <Absolute0> It seems like that's what they're doing here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html
[11:03:21] <Absolute0> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#updating-state
[11:04:17] <randomguy1> is socket.io a websocket implementation?
[11:04:21] <Absolute0> yes
[11:04:28] <randomguy1> yeah, that's better than polling
[11:04:38] <Absolute0> polling is expensive for the server?
[11:04:54] <randomguy1> polling encompases the entire http life cycle
[11:05:01] <randomguy1> headers, handshakes, yada yada
[11:05:07] <Absolute0> yup
[11:05:14] <randomguy1> websockets are just the data, after the sockets are established
[11:05:16] <Absolute0> and websockets
[11:05:20] <Absolute0> ok
[11:05:22] <randomguy1> and they are real time
[11:06:23] <randomguy1> discounting network latency, :)
[11:07:40] <Absolute0> Is it illegal to put a comma before the closing brace of an object/array in js?
[11:07:45] <Absolute0> Chrome doesn't seem to mind.
[11:09:10] <randomguy1> dunno
[11:09:19] <randomguy1> bad practice though
[11:11:33] <randomguy1> heh, sometimes i revert to the dot notation to avoid the commas, :)
[11:12:06] <Absolute0> but then you need to add semicolons
[11:12:32] * Absolute0 wonders why there's no python variant of coffeescript
[11:12:46] <Absolute0> http://pyjs.org/
[11:12:53] * Absolute0 stops wondering
[11:13:07] <Absolute0> http://www.skulpt.org/
[11:13:44] <randomguy1> one language i've never dabbled much in
[11:14:41] <Absolute0> What do you guys think of react?
[11:14:51] <randomguy1> unfamiliar
[11:22:59] <randomguy1> the view syntax i've liked the most so far was whatever came with node.js.  loved the whole tab based thing
[11:31:26] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 re: your comma before closing brace, that's actually not valid.
[11:31:35] <robertmaxrees> most js engines will ignore it though.
[11:36:19] <dopie> ok
[11:36:24] <dopie> i somewhat got somewhere
[11:36:25] <dopie> hehehe
[11:37:14] <arc_> lol. this guy
[11:37:24] <arc_> complaining about bad battery life on macbook air using chrome
[11:37:27] <arc_> It‚Äôs worth noting that I also happen to have 100-125 tabs on a browser under typical work load (don‚Äôt ask why or how ‚Äì it‚Äôs just how I work and I‚Äôm not willing to change that for a new and supposedly modern computer.
[11:38:52] <robertmaxrees> there's a dude that hangs out in some channels who runs a macbook with no battery, always plugged into the wall, uses tons of tabs, and thinks web developers are all dumb and incapable because nothing every runs well for him.
[11:39:14] <arc_> : /
[11:40:05] <robertmaxrees> welcome to the internet.
[11:40:31] <arc_> i should be able to do whatever i want with my computer and get the same performance! let me run 4 concurrent copies of crysis 3 and expect to get 8 hours of battery life
[11:40:47] <robertmaxrees> luckily that's not the normal user.
[11:46:30] <randomguy1> i'll take a person who has a ton of tabs over a person who installs all kinds of addons and complains about adware any day
[11:52:10] <xniz> can someone check out a page for me and tell me why the browser is not catching the click event on one of my elements?
[11:52:20] <xniz> http://soundfactory.comuf.com/ <-- click Artists at the top, then scroll down a bit and click "View Tracks"
[11:52:53] <graphettion> It catches the click.
[11:53:06] <xniz> odd... it should send an alert
[11:53:18] <graphettion> wait, it doesn't send an alert. Just does a hover
[11:53:25] <graphettion> So click does nothing
[11:53:29] <xniz> its supposed to alert on click :/
[11:53:44] <xniz> and i have the simplest line of code to detect it, so why is it not detecting it :/
[11:54:05] <graphettion> $(".view-track
[11:54:33] <xniz> should be $("#view-tracks-1")
[11:54:43] <graphettion> that's an id
[11:54:46] <graphettion> it's a class
[11:54:48] <graphettion> right?
[11:55:21] <xniz> it has multiple classes yes. but i need to have a unique id for each artist... hence the #view-tracks-1 meaning, view tracks from artist number 1
[11:55:37] <xniz> then on the artist below, i would use #view-tracks-2 etc
[11:55:43] <graphettion> ah, I see
[11:56:13] <xniz> that way I can code out which external html file to load into the #page div, according to which id is clicked
[11:56:29] <graphettion> Not sure if it matters but there is an error - GET http://stats.hosting24.com/count.php net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
[11:56:42] <graphettion> Line 42
[11:56:50] <randomguy1> is it a cross domain request?
[11:56:53] <xniz> not even my file
[11:57:01] <xniz> thats the crappy hosting i have
[11:57:05] <graphettion> ah
[11:57:34] <xniz> yeah im not sure because it recognizes when I click on the navigation list items... but nothing afer that
[11:57:41] <xniz> one moment ill pastebin the js
[11:58:04] <arc_> well, it should be $('#view-tracks-1').on('click', function(event) {
[11:58:36] <arc_> that has the same basic functionality so it won't fix your problem probably but
[11:58:45] <arc_> it's the recommended way of doing it now
[11:59:02] <xniz> ahh ok.. i was still running off of .click() in the jquery reference files
[11:59:55] <arc_> xniz what is in this include.html
[12:00:18] <arc_> if the content of the page is being loaded in this way, the event handler will not bind to the id
[12:00:30] <arc_> this code must be included in the include.html
[12:00:31] <xniz> arc_ that was my next question
[12:00:44] <xniz> include.html is the file I use for the index page
[12:00:53] <xniz> then artists.html will load into the browser when the user clicks on the artist link
[12:01:09] <xniz> I'm designing the website as a single-page application
[12:01:16] <xniz> for audio playback purposes
[12:01:37] <xniz> so then the click event handler will not work when I load the elements via external .HTML file?
[12:02:00] <arc_> if the target element is loaded after document ready, that is correct
[12:02:23] <xniz> well damn :/...
[12:02:31] <arc_> i'm not an expert in this but 'delegated event handlers' may be a solution to that problem
[12:02:47] <arc_> if not, the simplest solution is just to move this code into the html file that gets loaded
[12:03:04] <randomguy1> someone may correct me, but I believe it is typically the case that in a SPA all the javascript is included on the base page, not the future view imports
[12:03:05] <xniz> alright. I'll search into it a bit more.
[12:03:07] <arc_> that seems hacky to me but i don't know of a better way to do it
[12:03:37] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:03:41] <arc_> Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future.
[12:03:45] <arc_> that sounds like what you need
[12:03:53] <arc_> but again, i haven't messed with those yet so i don't know for sure
[12:04:03] <arc_> robertmaxrees would know
[12:04:05] <xniz> arc_ alright. thank you, sincerely. :)
[12:04:27] <randomguy1> what's the question about delegates?
[12:04:42] <arc_> well, he's trying to attach an event handler to an element that gets loaded in via .load
[12:04:48] <xniz> Correct
[12:04:59] <arc_> i think that doesn't work, and using delegated event handlers might be the solution
[12:05:31] <randomguy1> he can either attach it after it has been added to the page, or yes, attach a delegate to the parent element that already exists that the data is being inserted into
[12:05:32] <xniz> I'll know in a moment :/
[12:05:54] <arc_> ahh ... that statement actually made me understand what the point of delegation is :p
[12:06:20] <arc_> i never got around to reading that page i linked
[12:06:29] <xniz> randomguy1 i would like to use the option a.
[12:06:39] <randomguy1> the direct attach?
[12:06:46] <xniz> indeed.
[12:07:10] <randomguy1> then in your ajax or however your loading it, after you've added it to your dom, it is then able to be selected and events attached to it
[12:07:23] <xniz> randomguy1, alright. I will get to it.
[12:08:05] <randomguy1> however, you should give the delegate manner a read.  in certain cases, such as this, it can be less work
[12:08:52] <xniz> randomguy1 alright. thank you. I am reading into both solutions right now :)
[12:11:53] <xniz> randomguy1, I had more luck with delegate. thank you :)
[12:12:02] <randomguy1> good dal
[12:12:06] <randomguy1> *deal
[12:12:47] <meadhikari> guys how do I write this curl in jQuery curl -d '{ "auth_token": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN", "text": "Hey, Look what I can do!" }' http://example.com
[12:13:04] <xniz> indeed. this is my first SPA so it's a bit different. I'm so used to coding in the 90s lol. CSS/HTML/JS has evolved so much. its quite interesting
[12:13:10] <meadhikari> I tried many options but keep getting json parse error from the server
[12:17:10] <randomguy1> meadhikari: your sending it with ajax?
[12:17:22] <meadhikari> randomguy1, yes
[12:17:36] <randomguy1> random google, do you have the option "processData: false," set?
[12:17:58] <randomguy1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20155531/converting-curl-cmd-to-jquery-ajax
[12:20:25] <meadhikari> randomguy1, thanks man it worked
[12:20:26] <spottieottie> can someone please tell me what it means to initialize a slider in a script file? im trying to get this slider operational and its requiring me to initliaize it?
[12:20:28] <spottieottie> http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[12:21:22] <randomguy1> $(element).slick() is the initializor
[12:21:52] <randomguy1> it takes the element, manipulates it into a state that slick is expecting for the logic to work, applies any event handlers, and away you go
[12:22:07] <spottieottie> so how do I initialize it
[12:22:53] <randomguy1> you call .slick() on it.  for instance if your element has an id of 'slicky' it would be $('#slicky').slick()
[12:24:21] <spottieottie> i have the html and css inserted now but do I do next
[12:24:41] <spottieottie> what*
[12:25:20] <randomguy1> can you put what you have (short version) in a fiddle?
[12:25:22] <randomguy1> !paste
[12:25:22] <b-ot> randomguy1: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:26:26] <spottieottie> i have whats on this page in my dreamweaver, kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[12:26:35] <spottieottie> www.kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[12:27:42] <randomguy1> a small working example of the problem is prefered so we can see what you have and advise
[12:37:14] <spottieottie> in downloading this "slick slider plugin"   in the directory of the download, it has all these component.json files, make file, package.json, then in the net directory  config.rb, but no index, why the hell would there not be an index
[12:37:38] <robertmaxrees> why would there be one?>
[12:38:17] <spottieottie> because its a source file plug-in,...so there would be an example index like every other plug-in ive ever seen..?
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[12:38:34] <robertmaxrees> here are the demos
[12:38:58] <spottieottie> why would those other files be included with a slider, the config.rb? isnt that a ruby file why is that there
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> that's apart of how you build the plugin if you wanted to do that yourself.
[12:40:06] <pauled> Hello guys
[12:40:15] <spottieottie> so this person built the plug-in using ruby
[12:40:15] <spottieottie> ?
[12:40:24] <randomguy1> hey pauled
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> iirc config.rb would be for sass
[12:41:08] <pauled> please look the comments from here http://stackoverflow.com/a/30610515/ I don't understand about what the author are talking
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> pauled please ask simpler questions.
[12:41:38] <pauled> the IF condition look misc-formatted here?
[12:41:47] <robertmaxrees> if(html.length > 5) you mean?
[12:41:53] <pauled> yeah
[12:42:03] <robertmaxrees> curlies can be optional in certain cases.
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> that functions the same as if they were there.
[12:42:34] <pauled> it say one-liner but I see 3 lines
[12:42:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:43:14] <pauled> the condition IF is supposed to check length before continu the 2 following lines
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> the following one item.
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/jmeldn5/
[12:43:52] <randomguy1> if it's 'supposed' to only do the following two lines if that conditional is true, brackets would be required
[12:43:53] <robertmaxrees> this is what that code translates to if you add curlies.
[12:44:14] <randomguy1> as is, the second line will always happen
[12:46:47] <pauled> yes, even with your code robertmaxrees , it break the output if the length is superior
[12:46:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm just clarifying what that does does.
[12:47:04] <robertmaxrees> *code does
[12:47:06] <robertmaxrees> not fixing anything.
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> it is functionally identical to the other one.
[12:47:27] <pauled> let me show you fiddle
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> sure - a reduced test case would be great :)
[12:48:10] <pauled> http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/
[12:48:33] <robertmaxrees> you already have jquery loaded there.
[12:48:55] <robertmaxrees> no need to load it twice.
[12:48:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/2/
[12:49:45] <pauled> http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/1/
[12:50:04] <robertmaxrees> again, no need to load it twice -> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/3/
[12:50:07] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[12:50:20] <randomguy1> is streak a valid html tag?
[12:50:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:50:29] <robertmaxrees> nor is "double"
[12:50:33] <randomguy1> wth
[12:50:39] <robertmaxrees> he's writing a userscript.
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> dealing with the html of another site.
[12:50:55] <gambl0re> ajax is the process of retrieving data from the server and json is the file that is storing the data?
[12:51:04] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re kind of?
[12:51:27] <gambl0re> so json is like a database?
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[12:51:27] <randomguy1> json is a data structure
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a flat file that contains data.
[12:51:33] <randomguy1> or syntax
[12:51:37] <robertmaxrees> JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation
[12:52:58] <pauled> robertmaxrees: you don't see difference? the condition is not respected because $elem.html(html); are after '}'
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> i see they function differently.
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're confused about.
[12:53:32] <robertmaxrees> i've already explained what's going on.
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> you need $elem.html(html) to always run.
[12:54:00] <dopie> ok lets go through this step by step than
[12:54:18] <spottieottie> just because you explained something to how u see fit doesnt mean someone automatically gets it isnt that obvious?
[12:54:58] <dopie> ('#foo').submit   means that when a form with an id of #foo do something
[12:54:59] <dopie> ('#foo').submit(function() {   }  wraps a function around when #foo is submitted
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> I expect that they make an effort to understand it and clarify why they're confused.
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> dopie kind of.
[12:55:21] <randomguy1> dopie: correct
[12:55:44] <randomguy1> dopie: though in the first case it could actually be executing the submit
[12:55:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo').submit(); will submit the form.  $('#foo').submit(function() {}); binds an event listener.
[12:57:17] <tkdaj> anyone in here ever use JQuery UI datepicker?
[12:57:22] <pauled> robertmaxrees: real you don't see what is wrong here? http://i.imgur.com/fHjniMz.png
[12:57:34] <__bpp> what do you all think about polymer?
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> pauled i cannot read your mind.
[12:57:44] <pauled> real/really
[12:57:50] <pauled> just see the result
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> !ask
[12:57:52] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:58:01] <robertmaxrees> pauled i see the result - what are you expecting?
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> i cannot read your mind.
[12:58:07] <pauled> common just see the result
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you want.
[12:58:25] <pauled> look at the screenshot please
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> I DID.
[12:58:58] <robertmaxrees> i cannot read your mind - what are you expecting to have happen?
[12:59:20] <pauled> you don't see: startstreak>1streak>2double>3double>4span>5span>6streak>7streak>8double>9double>10streak>end
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> i do see it.
[12:59:27] <randomguy1> actually, if the concept is to only change the html if the number of elements is > 19, i'd think the $elem.html() would need to be in the if.  as it is, if the if doesn't happen, your setting the html() with an array variable
[12:59:29] <arthurvr> pauled: please clearly explain what you‚Äôd like to see, we can‚Äôt help you this way.
[12:59:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're expecting to have happen instead.
[12:59:45] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr ++
[12:59:51] <pauled> why the html is misformatted?
[13:00:03] <pauled> it's break
[13:00:04] <robertmaxrees> pauled misformatted how?  what are you expecting it to look like?
[13:00:07] <randomguy1> the if doesn't happen, html() is being passed an array
[13:00:08] <tkdaj> you don't want to see the words span in there?
[13:00:24] <tkdaj> or the >?
[13:01:09] <pauled> robertmaxrees: it's a jock?
[13:01:19] <robertmaxrees> pauled huh?
[13:01:26] <__bpp> arthurvr: robertmaxrees: don't attack pauled just help him that's where this channel is for.
[13:01:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> __bpp we can't help him if we don't understand the problem.
[13:01:53] <pauled> are you kiding me , there is clearly clear like watter, the HTML is fucked by that if statement
[13:02:07] <robertmaxrees> pauled you're not explaining the end result you want.
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> i can't read your mind.
[13:02:22] <arthurvr> __bpp: what robertmaxrees said.
[13:02:23] <pauled> ok you kiding me
[13:02:30] <pauled> nevermind
[13:02:45] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming we know the end result you want.
[13:02:49] <spottieottie> pauled lets start from the beginning
[13:03:41] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/dtrn2na2/4/ ?
[13:05:26] <randomguy1> or http://jsfiddle.net/dtrn2na2/5/
[13:05:43] <pauled> randomguy1: your code break the html http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/6/
[13:06:23] <pauled> even with the next http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/7/
[13:07:24] <__bpp> arthurvr: robertmaxrees: nope, you're repetitively  attacking someone with useless questions that just wants his markup fixed.
[13:07:38] <robertmaxrees> __bpp i have no idea what they want.
[13:07:40] <robertmaxrees> honestly.
[13:08:12] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/dtrn2na2/9/
[13:08:17] <arthurvr> Me too. Also I don‚Äôt get how we‚Äôre ‚Äùattacking‚Äù. We‚Äôre trying to understand a problem in order to help someone.
[13:08:29] <robertmaxrees> if the issue is that they're expecting to preserve the tags, the problem is pretty clear - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/8/
[13:09:26] <__bpp> arthurvr: robertmaxreees: than maybe you're less smart than him with jQuery and understand and don't jump on this issue ;)
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> __bpp lol
[13:09:47] <robertmaxrees> yes, two mods are "less smart" than he is with jquery ;)
[13:09:47] <arthurvr> __bpp: at least we should be able to understand the problem, than :p
[13:10:41] <__bpp> not offending just maybe this specific case.
[13:11:06] <randomguy1> i'm fixing to leave for the day, but really, instead of doing the split, could you not get the children and for the ones past whatever index, just.remove() them?
[13:11:08] <arthurvr> __bpp: I honestly don‚Äôt want to have an argument today. If you have something useful to add feel free :)
[13:11:34] <__bpp> are you now saying that I'm not useful? lol than I'd rather leave.
[13:11:48] <robertmaxrees> __bpp that's not what he's saying at all
[13:11:49] <arthurvr> I wasn‚Äôt just pointing out that the argument would be useless.
[13:12:21] <robertmaxrees> __bpp if you have some concerns, feel free to PM me :) we can definitely chat about it.
[13:12:44] <randomguy1> later all, play nice, :D
[13:12:48] <pauled> please stop with my case. Forget it thanks for the help anyway
[13:17:41] <dopie> ok
[13:17:42] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/joax57y9/4/
[13:18:15] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:20:21] <robertmaxrees> dopie are you trying to default #foo if it doesn't have a value?
[13:21:07] <dopie> Yes
[13:21:13] <dopie> thats step 1
[13:22:23] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[13:22:43] <pauled> So let rephrase my question: do you have a better solution for this case? http://stackoverflow.com/q/30610364/
[13:23:09] <dopie> 1. I setup to check when #foobar is submitted
[13:23:13] <dopie> which i did with line 1
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> actually..
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> you have your curlies and parens all mixed up :)
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/joax57y9/7/
[13:24:19] <dopie> rofl
[13:24:28] <dopie> i got new contacts in
[13:24:29] <dopie> haha
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> the syntax is if (/* code */) { /* more code */}
[13:27:13] <dopie> I c :)
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> pauled so you want to truncate everything before the first 6 pages?
[13:28:20] <pauled> yes 6 is an example
[13:30:49] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I want your think, do you see the Samuel Liew's answer useful?
[13:31:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:31:45] <pauled> why? because IF statement or everything?
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> the whole thing - it's relying on regex to parse HTML, which is never what you want.
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> i will give you a freebie here.
[13:32:38] <pauled> because if I move '}' after $elem.html(html); it work
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> then what are you asking here?
[13:33:49] <pauled> in my last sentence? I just give notice something else
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> you said that the code works.
[13:34:01] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[13:34:08] <robertmaxrees> that the markup is bad?
[13:34:56] <robertmaxrees> because the cleanest way would start here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/10/
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably need to add some styling to fix that up, but it's what you want otherwise.
[13:35:33] <pauled> in the state of the answer it does not. It only works if I add "{}" but you said to me that it is incorrect.
[13:36:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?  i didn't say adding {} is incorrect.  i think somebody else pointed out that would change how the code works.
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> i pointed out it wouldn't be functionally identical depending on where you put the closing curly.
[13:38:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/12/
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> here you go.
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> your freebie.
[13:39:02] <xniz> you only get one! use it wisely! ;)
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> ;)(
[13:40:05] <xniz> crap i need to design an audio player :/ pfft
[13:40:34] <flashpoint9> Im trying to string a dom element onto a this but cant seem to google the right thing to figure it out
[13:40:35] <flashpoint9>         $(this).toggleClass('image-gallery-hover');
[13:40:43] <flashpoint9> but want         $(this img).toggleClass('image-gallery-hover');
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('img')
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> or $('img', this)
[13:41:02] <flashpoint9> ugh
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> both do the same thing.
[13:41:11] <flashpoint9> i like the second
[13:41:17] <flashpoint9> i knew about .find
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> i prefer the former personally.
[13:41:35] <flashpoint9> but thought it was ridiculous to have to string that on there
[13:41:40] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> it's explicit and clear.
[13:43:05] <flashpoint9> its clear, but i dont want to have to string on find unless i have to traverse and find elements in a complex structure, plus its another function call
[13:43:21] <robertmaxrees> except the other one uses it under the hood :)
[13:43:30] <robertmaxrees> and you ARE traversing the document.
[13:43:41] <pauled> robertmaxrees: same problem, if the html element are less that the index() value, it break the output http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/14/
[13:43:59] <flashpoint9> i know, i said i would use find for traversing complex structures, my markup is very simple
[13:44:22] <robertmaxrees> pauled ... you put 12 in there.
[13:44:28] <pauled> yeah
[13:44:33] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 imo marlkup structure is irrelevant.
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> pauled so you filtered out everything.
[13:44:51] <pauled> the html can be less than the value
[13:44:59] <robertmaxrees> pauled so then what are you asking now?
[13:45:54] <pauled> I thought I was pretty clear. truncating output in a certain value
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> do you only want the code to run if there's more than a certain number of pages?
[13:46:06] <pauled> yes
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> then wrap that code in an if statement.
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/15/
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> clarified even further: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dtrn2na2/16/
[13:48:27] <robertmaxrees> you could play with those truncateAt uses to get whatever makes the most sense to you.
[13:49:44] <pauled> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/18/
[13:49:59] <pauled> oh wait let me see 15
[13:50:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:50:09] <pauled> 16 meant
[13:51:07] <pauled> same problem here http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/dtrn2na2/19/
[13:51:15] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue now dude?
[13:51:23] <robertmaxrees> you're just copying my code and saying "it's brokenb"
[13:51:38] <pauled> no, I changed the value
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> correct - so what's the problem?
[13:52:34] <pauled> here is 11, so if my table show the same number + 1 it will be breaked
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> broken how?  did you want to exclude "end" from the count?
[13:53:27] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/soaqxugy/          ----- on line 12 what is the value of function parameters?
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re specifically http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/#jQuery-each-array-callback - look at the "callback" part.
[13:54:06] <pauled> robertmaxrees: let me show you a live example of what I am trying to do
[13:54:16] <robertmaxrees> pauled please explain what it's NOT doing.
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> burying this in a larger context won't help :)
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> would you like to exclude "end" from the count?
[13:55:21] <pauled> robertmaxrees: please forgive me, look that page, particulary the standing table http://en.lichess.org/tournament/OKzR9STe
[13:55:24] <gambl0re> indexinarray, value
[13:56:07] <gambl0re> did you make that website?
[13:56:14] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I just want to truncate it in a value that show each <td> in one line
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re nope.
[13:56:57] <gambl0re> not you, pauled
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> pauled great?  i don't understand what my code does not do then.
[13:57:25] <pauled> gambl0re: no, it's ornicar #lichess
[13:57:38] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "it doesn't work", don't explain how, then point me to another page and expect me to suddenly understand.
[13:58:30] <pauled> robertmaxrees: if the value are same +1 as the number of element
[13:58:50] <pauled> robertmaxrees: it will not return the html element
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:59:22] <pauled> I showed you in the fiddle
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> so you want to excluide "end" from the county?
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> *count
[13:59:57] <pauled> no, I want to show n last results
[14:00:19] <robertmaxrees> so you want truncateAt to instead be the last n results to display?
[14:00:43] <pauled> but at the start of the tournament, it can be less element in the table
[14:00:47] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> you want to show the 10 most recent results.
[14:01:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean there are always more than.
[14:01:17] <robertmaxrees> just no more than the last 10.
[14:01:25] <pauled> yes
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> okay - that's doable.
[14:01:51] <dopie> ok
[14:01:52] <dopie> now!!
[14:01:54] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/618fa6adb48a67107226
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> pauled https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:02:00] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[14:02:05] <dopie> im a #foo was checked
[14:02:07] <pauled> ok thanks
[14:02:20] <dopie> if #foo was checked than change #bar
[14:02:27] <robertmaxrees> dopie use .change(), not .click()
[14:02:43] <dopie> k
[14:02:57] <ChrisBinge> hey @robertmaxrees i've been working on that same load/resize issue for that font size script, I've isolated that it fires on the load, but doesn't return the correct value until multiple firings
[14:02:58] <ChrisBinge> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30563880/function-doesnt-fire-on-load-but-works-on-resize
[14:04:09] <robertmaxrees> pauled .slice() would be anopther candidate.
[14:04:50] <ChrisBinge> maybe is it incorrectly computing the parent element at doc.ready()?
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, pauled use https://api.jquery.com/slice/ instead.
[14:05:24] <pauled> ok thanks
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge huh?
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge i'm not sure i remember your problem.
[14:05:48] <ChrisBinge> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30563880/function-doesnt-fire-on-load-but-works-on-resize
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> right, i see that.
[14:06:16] <ChrisBinge> so the issue is, the script fires on resize, and it fills the container
[14:06:22] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:06:26] <ChrisBinge> but on the initial load, it does not fill the container
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> so ChrisBinge my guess is a quirk with document ready vs. stylesheets
[14:12:27] <ChrisBinge> I've thought that as well, running a settimeout and checking the order things are loaded in at
[14:12:32] <pauled> robertmaxrees: just another one question, on previous lichess link, in the table there is pager, I can change page of the standing table without changing url, I have a code that truncate url, but it fail if I change standing table page
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i mean, ChrisBinge :)
[14:12:48] <ChrisBinge> not sure I follow than
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge things getting parsed and applied is distinct from where you put a style tag in relation to other stuff.
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> have you tried debugging this function?
[14:13:18] <robertmaxrees> pauled huh?
[14:13:34] <pauled> robertmaxrees: DOM Mutation doesn't seem to work here
[14:13:56] <pauled> there is another way to keep the script running on that page?
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> in relation to what?
[14:14:26] <robertmaxrees> if you can identify an event, you can re-run your code.
[14:15:25] <ChrisBinge> to be honest I'm not sure how to go about walking through JS function
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ shows you everything you need to know, ChrisBinge :)
[14:15:52] <ChrisBinge> awesome, i'll check it out
[14:59:07] <testerbit> How can I tell if this will bind multiple times?: http://pastebin.com/62k8TLX5
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> the click event binding?
[15:00:31] <robertmaxrees> testerbit if this is in a function that gets called more than once, then it'll bind multiple times.
[15:01:11] <testerbit> will have to investigate further, thanks
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> you could change where you're binding to fwiw.
[15:02:03] <robertmaxrees> though that actually doesn't help if you're calling that whole thing more than once.
[15:09:19] <dopie> ok....
[15:09:22] <dopie> LK$@#L:$K@#LK:$@#
[15:09:23] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/8/
[15:09:37] <dopie> err wait
[15:09:50] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/9/
[15:10:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:10:29] <robertmaxrees> so if (this.text) == 'R' isn't the right format there.
[15:10:56] <robertmaxrees> remember, it's if (/* test */) { /* rest of your code */ }
[15:11:11] <dopie> k
[15:11:27] <robertmaxrees> also, $('#foo option:selected').text(function(){ isn't what you want either.
[15:11:31] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do there?
[15:11:56] <dopie> when an option is selected it changes the label name
[15:12:25] <robertmaxrees> so $('#foo option:selected') will select the option that's selected on pageload.
[15:12:31] <robertmaxrees> .text() is a way to read or set text.
[15:13:02] <robertmaxrees> also: when reading inputs/selects/etc, you wnat .val(), not .text()
[15:14:08] <dopie> k
[15:14:27] <robertmaxrees> so start with the first line - bind to the change event of the select element in stead.
[15:16:12] <dopie> $('#foo').change(function(){
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, yeah.
[15:16:24] <dopie> whats the other way?
[15:16:40] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo').on('change', function() {});
[15:16:50] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is what .change() is actually doing for you.
[15:18:06] <dopie> so both ways work
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:21:04] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/11/
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> cool, okay, so next up: this isn't what you think it is.
[15:21:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a DOM node, so you need to either use $(this).val() or this.value
[15:23:06] <robertmaxrees> also - you want to use === and not ==
[15:23:47] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/14/
[15:23:48] <dopie> 1?@
[15:23:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:23:59] <robertmaxrees> .val() gives you the value.
[15:24:19] <robertmaxrees> and it's $(this).val(), or just this.value
[15:26:45] <dopie>     if $(this).val === ('R') {
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:26:57] <robertmaxrees> remember, everything needs to go between the ( and ) for the if.
[15:27:04] <dopie> ahhhh ok
[15:27:06] <dopie> dammit sorry
[15:27:08] <robertmaxrees> and it's $(this).val() or this.value
[15:29:24] <ChrisBinge> hey robertmaxrees, i've figured out the debugging thanks for the resourse. As i
[15:29:39] <ChrisBinge> i've debugged it thought all the values are correct through my breakpoints
[15:30:24] <robertmaxrees> try console logging it instead.
[15:31:09] <ChrisBinge> I'l give it a whirl
[15:34:44] <dopie>     if $(this.value === 'R') {
[15:34:44] <dopie>     if $(this.value === 'R') {
[15:34:48] <dopie> yes!
[15:34:49] <dopie> ?!@
[15:37:02] <ChrisBinge> aha.. parent height is either 333 or...16
[15:37:54] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/18/
[15:38:01] <robertmaxrees> dopie nope.
[15:38:09] <robertmaxrees> if ()
[15:38:11] <robertmaxrees> again.
[15:38:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/11/ was close.
[15:38:44] <robertmaxrees> just need to use this.value or $(this).val()
[15:38:47] <robertmaxrees> one or the other
[15:39:20] <shoky> also don't use .val on a <label> ;p
[15:39:27] <robertmaxrees> shoky we're getting there :)
[15:41:12] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/pbuv2j7e/20/
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:41:40] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).val() == 'R')  { or if (this.value == 'R')  {
[15:41:49] <dopie> 5i just saw that
[15:41:51] <dopie> ARGH!@#KL
[15:41:54] <dopie> i was like nooooooooo!
[15:42:04] <robertmaxrees> slow down :)
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> next up, $('.bizzle').val('Hey') will never work.  .bizzle is a label.  are you trying to set the text of #ark ?
[15:42:51] <dopie> I'm trying to change the label name
[15:42:58] <robertmaxrees> then you want .text()
[15:43:07] <dopie>        $('.bizzle').text('Hey')
[15:43:15] <dopie> i figured that out too :P hehehe
[15:43:16] <robertmaxrees> .val() is only for input values.  .text() is for changing element text.
[15:43:26] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ you should check this out.
[15:43:41] <dopie> I did i like this pain resistance thing
[15:44:00] <dopie> robertmaxrees, you are teaching me
[15:44:01] <dopie> :)
[15:44:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:44:25] <robertmaxrees> you need a javascript 101.
[15:44:39] <dopie> I need javascript 001
[15:44:40] <dopie> hehe
[15:44:44] <dopie> but i can't at the moment
[15:44:53] <robertmaxrees> errr, why not?
[15:45:33] <dopie> because I was trying to do this till tomorrow morning and then I have until friday to present what I did and then on the weekend I'm going to do javascript 101
[15:45:47] <robertmaxrees> except you're relying a bunch on other people to do this for you :)
[15:45:56] <dopie> I'm not
[15:46:04] <dopie> you are helping me understand as I fumble
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out - you're having a real tough time with things like if statements.
[15:51:12] <ChrisBinge> So according to the docs ready should wait for dom load "this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received." but this isn't happening with my function, what gives?
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:51:29] <robertmaxrees> link?
[15:51:37] <ChrisBinge> https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[15:52:02] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.  sounds about right.
[15:52:16] <robertmaxrees> "recieved" is key there.
[15:52:31] <dopie> So I set        $('.bizzle').text('Hey')
[15:52:42] <ChrisBinge> is there a call to execute after the dom has been populated?
[15:52:54] <robertmaxrees> that's what document ready is, ChrisBinge
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> is this the text size issue still?
[15:53:20] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[15:53:29] <robertmaxrees> because i get the feeling you're dealing with a quirk about css layout and window sizing.
[15:53:32] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess though.
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> have you considered filing a bug?
[15:53:50] <ChrisBinge> with jquery?
[15:53:55] <robertmaxrees> mmhmmm.
[15:54:24] <ChrisBinge> i am down to do that, I just wasn't sure if I am just making mistakes on my end
[15:55:23] <ChrisBinge> not sure where to file a bug either
[15:55:30] <robertmaxrees> the github repo.
[15:55:37] <dopie> brb
[15:55:52] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[15:56:00] <ChrisBinge> thanks
[15:57:22] <robertmaxrees> make sure you link to a fiddle showing the issue.
[15:58:04] <ChrisBinge> for sure
[16:13:33] <ChrisBinge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2379
[16:15:58] <bratchley> what can I check if an $.ajax() call executes beforesend but not "success" even though the server sees that it's returning a valid JSON response?
[16:16:28] <robertmaxrees> the .fail() callback and/or your network tab.
[16:22:42] <bratchley> robertmaxrees: ty
[16:29:41] <Lencl> for jquery mobile, the delete button shows "error loading page"
[16:29:59] <Lencl> how can I take control over what delete button displays? I know it's a default message
[16:32:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:35:03] <Lencl> ah nvm i found my issue
[17:21:05] <igyiguygyu> I'm making a horizontal layout page (instead of scrolling down it's scrolling horizontally). For each section there is wrapper with 100vw width. However, to avoid someone stopping in between the sections I'd like for the js to auto center the view to the centre of the section you're currently at. Is there a library that does something like that?
[17:21:26] <igyiguygyu> It should only kick in if you stop scrolling
[18:22:28] <Sal> does anyonw know why when i set focus on an inpout, the entire web page move left 50% showing on the right a half blank page?
[18:23:04] <Sal> debuging, i found out that its the .focus() that does it
[18:37:44] <pauled> the truncate function drive me crazy
[18:39:50] <Sal> does anyonw know why when i set focus on an input, the entire web page moves left 50% showing on the right a half blank page?
[18:53:56] <pauled> Sal: which page?
[18:54:08] <Sal> main
[18:54:11] <Sal> first
[18:54:19] <Sal> the one that's shown
[18:54:23] <pauled> but what site?
[18:54:23] <Sal> damn
[18:54:27] <pauled> which site?
[18:54:32] <Sal> local work
[18:54:43] <pauled> oh, then I can't reproduce
[18:54:59] <Sal> i just do a .focus()
[18:55:10] <ezek2k4> is it a bad idea to use set interval to check new messages using ajax/php (from mysql)
[18:55:57] <Sal> pauled, is there anything that i can do to test it out?
[18:56:18] <pauled> Sal: fiddle?
[18:56:29] <Sal> no, i mean me on local
[18:56:37] <Sal> you in my place, what would you do?
[18:56:50] <Sal> maybe i'm not trying to find the bug the correct way
[18:56:57] <pauled> asking help here ^^
[18:57:07] <pauled> with a fiddle
[18:57:25] <Sal> yes, but on these channels without fiddle nobody moves
[18:57:34] <Sal> right, thats it
[18:58:16] <pauled> I have not the skill to guess what is your issue, somebody have but they are iddling
[18:58:30] <Sal> ok
[18:58:33] <ezek2k4> sal are u good with css :) i can fiddle you something :P hehe
[18:58:56] <drej> Sal: why'd you run away earlier
[18:59:01] <drej> i wanted to show you a better way of doing the search thing
[18:59:11] <Sal> drej, oh, sorry
[18:59:16] <drej> just in/out
[18:59:32] <Sal> i didn't want to break more
[18:59:35] <drej> lol
[18:59:42] <drej> http://pud.ca/projects/qibelly/ anyway check how i did the search there
[18:59:52] <drej> no javascript, and 100% accessible and properly marked up
[19:00:11] <Sal> thats great!
[19:00:22] <Sal> how did you get the docus in it?
[19:00:30] <Sal> (its my actual problem)
[19:00:38] <Sal> focus
[19:00:39] <drej> its got a label and an input
[19:00:42] <drej> and a button
[19:00:53] <drej> when you click a label which has a for attribute properly related to an input
[19:00:55] <drej> it focuses the input
[19:01:13] <pauled> drej: I have to scroll to see the search
[19:01:15] <Sal> damn, me again
[19:01:18] <ezek2k4> thats a cool webpage :)
[19:01:25] <drej> pauled: wat
[19:01:58] <pauled> I have to scroll the page to see the menu with search input
[19:02:10] <drej> in which direction
[19:02:22] <drej> what browser?
[19:02:54] <pauled> it appear only if I scroll first
[19:03:03] <pauled> chrome 42
[19:03:22] <pauled> scroll down direction
[19:03:41] <pauled> you want a screenshot?
[19:03:44] <drej> its definitely there on load
[19:03:49] <drej> just not on a black fixed position
[19:04:19] <Sal> drej, thats too much for me
[19:04:29] <Sal> you're using the icon as a label
[19:04:43] <Sal> so when you click on it, it sets the focus
[19:04:50] <drej> yup
[19:05:00] <drej> but then when its focused, the button's z-index goes above the label
[19:05:04] <drej> so now the icon is the button
[19:05:15] <Sal> great idea, but too much for me to put it inside my mess
[19:05:29] <pauled> drej: http://i.imgur.com/9TPPvVl.png
[19:05:30] <ezek2k4> drej i know this isnt css but im sure u can tell me whats wrong with my button why the text isnt on bottom of the + picture https://jsfiddle.net/5rx6uzf4/
[19:05:32] <ezek2k4> :)
[19:05:48] <drej> oh weird pauled
[19:05:56] <drej> you running any accessibility stuff / custom themes?
[19:06:25] <drej> pauled: http://i.pud.ca/image/300p420V0426
[19:06:28] <drej> chrome 43
[19:06:33] <drej> i mean, chrome, anything, really
[19:06:47] <ezek2k4> works fine on chrome 43+ie11+ff
[19:07:31] <pauled> no, no accessibility, but running some extension ... AH yes I figured out what was. Deluminate
[19:13:56] <pauled> drej: you have your own screenshot hoster?
[19:15:37] <drej> neg
[19:15:40] <drej> i use getcloudapp.com
[19:15:45] <drej> but i have a paid account so i get to use my own domain
[19:21:05] <pauled> that is pretty cool
[19:30:43] <pauled> drej: I got disconnected
[21:15:58] <phelix> I am using ajax and the call posts to a php script. The php script is returning the results in json. But it seems the jquery is displaying the JSON instead of converting it to html on the page. Could I be missing something?
[21:18:09] <phelix> http://pastie.org/10222730 here is the jquery
[21:22:55] <shoky> phelix: you're appending the json directly.. javascript/jquery have no concept of converting json to html. that's something you do yourself.. depending on how you want to display it
[21:23:26] <shoky> oh i didn't see the bottom part
[21:24:06] <shoky> oh, no json here at all
[21:25:35] <phelix> what you mean? Normally when I have taken the results of an ajax request I return it formatted as json and then when I apply the results it has always converted it for me.. wondering what i might be missing
[21:25:36] <shoky> phelix: it seems maybe you should use dataType: 'json'  instead, if your php is outputting a json string.  or, have your php output html, not json
[21:26:12] <phelix> ahh it was my datatype
[21:26:16] <phelix> ok got it! thank you!
[21:26:20] <shoky> cool

[23:05:38] <krasimir> hi all trying to load an external page with the colorbox but the external page has some javascript file call in it and the first time it returns an error , but it works the second time
[23:06:01] <krasimir> here is a link http://dev1.portal.vip-consult.co.uk/loader.php
[23:07:43] <krasimir> one way would be to move the called js file inside the main page , but i prefer to keep in the form itself
[23:29:57] <Cork> krasimir: when javascript is loaded inside an ajax call jquery is executing it through eval
[23:30:15] <Cork> krasimir: so you get call order problem
[23:30:48] <krasimir> Cork : any pointer how to solve ?
[23:31:02] <Cork> krasimir: why not just load it statically with the original page?
[23:32:14] <krasimir> I wanted to keep it separate. for perfomance and maintenance reasons. the main page has too many js files already
[23:32:41] <Cork> krasimir: well then you would have to fetch it with .getScript
[23:32:55] <Cork> and from its callback do the call you're currently doing
[23:33:18] <krasimir> aha
