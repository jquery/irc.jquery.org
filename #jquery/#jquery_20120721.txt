[00:00:04] <AliG1000> @ Back2Basics - I don't think it will help any more than my original url but... http://jsfiddle.net/Sz6W2/
[00:00:16] <M1k1> hey
[00:00:27] <M1k1> can ask have problem with fade in on 1.8.b2?
[00:00:32] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  $.css(property, value);  To delete a value I set null , or is '' fine?
[00:01:35] <AcademyIntl> ? css
[00:01:36] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[00:02:09] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: You are in a jquery chat.  so where is the javascript and the ajax you mentioned?
[00:02:59] <AliG1000> the Javascript is in the Manage Resources panel
[00:03:24] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: the one that submits your form?
[00:03:35] <AcademyIntl> The jQuery API Docs do not seem to answer this.
[00:03:42] <AliG1000> I don't know ow to put AJAX in JSFiddle (it's works better at http://bus.cr/index2.php as it is connected to the database)
[00:04:30] <AcademyIntl> Also @jQuery bot-t FAQ feature is defunct.
[00:04:56] <AcademyIntl> (tr.im returns "404 Not Found")
[00:05:41] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: where are you entering this data? http://bus.cr/index2.php
[00:06:44] <AliG1000> I am typing in the form field.  It uses the letters I type to search a database - this is what it would bring back as an example: http://bus.cr/autocomplete-search.php?term=moravia
[00:07:32] <AliG1000> Note that there is an ID there.  I don't know how to put the ID in a hidden field so that I can submit it with the form, and have it appear in the url
[00:07:48] <AliG1000> (the url of the next page, that is)
[00:08:39] <AcademyIntl> AliG1000: In a GET method HTML form ALL inputs are appended to the URL.
[00:08:53] <AcademyIntl> AliG1000: Example: <input type="hidden" name="id" value="12" /> will produce ?id=12
[00:09:06] <AliG1000> correct
[00:09:30] <AcademyIntl> AliG1000: Then what's the problem?  (I admitedly wasn't paying attention.)
[00:09:42] <AliG1000> how do I get the record ID that comes back with the JSON to appear in the hidden field?
[00:09:43] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: the documentation you can look at is here  http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[00:10:27] <AliG1000> how do I update the 'value' of the hidden field?
[00:11:55] <AcademyIntl> AliG1000: Give that hidden field an ID, then you can set it with $('#someID').attr('value', 'somevalue');
[00:15:03] <AliG1000> how would I adjust this: http://pastebin.com/8WeDDGCs
[00:16:08] <Back2Basics> AliG1000: but if you want to make the box super complex then do it with ajax which is found here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[00:19:29] <AcademyIntl> AliG1000: http://jsbin.com/awudud
[00:23:08] <AliG1000> @ AcademyIntl - the         $('#id').attr('value', ui.item.id); line worked - thank you !
[00:30:24] <eni> sucess:function(data){alert(data)} is the success of a $.get. It prints out {"id":-2}. How do i get the -2 only? data['id'], data["id"], data.id don't work.
[00:31:51] <Back2Basics> Anyone heard of a jquery module that recreates and collects the funcationality of google maps right click "What's here?"
[00:38:33] <M1k1> can ask have problem with fade in on 1.8.b2?
[01:11:31] <surunt> hi
[01:13:00] <surunt> Anybody can help me regarding Dropdown Menuin Jquery
[01:13:20] <surunt> i found a Sample on http://www.jqueryload.com/jquery-dropdown-menu-with-google-style
[01:14:07] <surunt> but its sub->Sublevel not working perfectly
[01:23:12] <sunoano> how would I do a selector for the HTML5 header tag http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_header.asp
[01:23:12] <sunoano> $("header").click(function () { $(this).slideUp(1000)}); doesn't work
[01:27:46] <shoky> sunoano: $("header") is fine
[01:29:18] <sunoano> note to self: empty your browser cache ;)
[01:29:26] <sunoano> it sure works, cheers mate
[01:31:17] <shoky> eni: looks like data is a string. set the dataType to json and data.id should work fine
[01:31:29] <eni> shoky, thanks :)
[01:31:43] <eni> I used something like JSON.parse but i think your case should be better/cleaner.
[01:31:51] <shoky> yeap that's fine too
[01:41:01] <eni> So i have some <a class="clickable">asd</a> in my html code, and $('.clickable').click(function(){ alert("clicked!");}); in my js. but it's not alert-ing when clicked. How do I debug this?
[01:41:57] <shoky> eni: are you running it inside a DOM ready handler?
[01:42:23] <eni> shoky, i don't understand your question
[01:42:30] <eni> what is a DOM ready handler?
[01:42:52] <eni> (I've included the .js before the </body>.. I've included jquery in the <head>)
[01:43:00] <shoky> eni: $(document).ready(function() { ...your_code... });    or  $(function() { ...your_code... });
[01:43:24] <shoky> have you read the jquery getting started page?
[01:43:45] <shoky> eni: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[01:43:56] <eni> shoky, it's not inside a document.ready,
[01:44:06] <shoky> then that's why it's not working
[01:44:23] <eni> I'm not sure, I'll try.
[01:45:47] <eni> ok it looks like this now, and still not working : 	$(document).ready(function() { $('.changepoplist').click(function() { alert("clicked!");}); });
[01:46:20] <shoky> the element with class changepoplist is already in the DOM tree when you're calling that?
[01:46:38] <shoky> console.log( $('.changepoplist').length )
[01:46:50] <shoky> to see if it finds your element or not
[01:48:01] <eni> shoky, in fact it is working in FF but not in Chrome.
[01:48:38] <shoky> best reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle i guess
[01:48:43] <shoky> www.jsfiddle.net
[01:49:02] <eni> yeah, but it's a complex site
[01:49:14] <shoky> don't reproduce the site, reproduce the issue ;P
[01:49:14] <eni> i cant upload some lines there are multiple lines php/js/html
[01:49:25] <eni> it's almost impossible :)
[01:49:27] <eni> but thanks
[01:49:38] <shoky> also you didn't answer my q
[01:49:52] <shoky> is the <a> in the DOM tree already when you're calling $('.changepoplist')... ?
[01:50:27] <eni> shoky, i imagine yes (since it's working now and the console displayed '2' as output of your line)
[01:50:36] <eni> nothing is added later
[01:50:42] <eni> so i don't think i have to use .live
[01:50:52] <shoky> in chrome it outputs 0 ?
[01:51:02] <eni> in google-chrome it works as well
[01:51:07] <eni> in chromium-browser it doesn't
[01:51:12] <shoky> o_O
[01:51:14] <eni> (using linux)
[01:51:38] <eni> maybe my version of chromium-browser is old.. dunno, anyways makes the problems smaller now :)
[01:54:14] <wathek> Hi everybody
[01:55:10] <wathek> do you know any way to cut or hide the overflow part of an image from an area look at this image http://troll.ws/MP2L97 you see the little penguin at the top left of the area I want to hide the overflow part of it
[01:58:51] <shoky> wathek: if you have overflow:hidden on the container, and the penguin img is a descendant, it should work fine
[01:59:13] <wathek> shoky, yes but the problem is that the img got an absolute position
[01:59:22] <wathek> I tried with overflow:hidden but doesn't work
[01:59:23] <shoky> that's fine i think
[01:59:28] <shoky> as long as it's not fixed
[01:59:54] <wathek> shoky, do you want to see it ?
[02:00:41] <wathek> shoky, http://wathek.homelinux.org/wathek/createur/?tid=1&cid=1
[02:03:27] <shoky> wathek: you need position:relative on the container
[02:03:43] <shoky> (and then you'll need to fix up your penguin positions)
[02:03:50] <wathek> mmm
[02:04:04] <shoky> that will make the penguin positions actually relative to the container
[02:04:11] <shoky> so 0,0 will be top-left corner
[02:04:13] <shoky> as should be
[02:04:17] <wathek> I see
[02:07:10] <wathek> shoky, the problem with a relative position is that when I add multiple elements the first one got 0, 0 as coordinate which is the top left corner but the second one will have 0, 0 and will be put under the first one let me show you
[02:08:05] <wathek> shoky, http://wathek.homelinux.org/wathek/createur/?tid=1&cid=1
[02:08:17] <wathek> shoky, look at it know but image got top = 0 and left = 0
[02:09:20] <wathek> shoky, so if I move the second image to the top left corner its coodinates will be negative
[02:09:36] <guy> var column		= $('<div class="column"></div>').wrap('<div class="bar"></div>');
[02:09:41] <guy> why this doesn't work?
[02:09:55] <shoky> wathek: i dont understand
[02:09:55] <guy> doesn't work – element is not wrapeed.
[02:10:08] <wathek> shoky, do you see the two penguins ?
[02:10:13] <shoky> wathek: yeah
[02:11:26] <wathek> shoky, both have position set to relative and both got coordinates (0, 0) try to move the second penguin to the top you'll see that it's coordinates became negatives
[02:11:46] <shoky> wathek: they have position:absolute
[02:11:53] <wathek> huh ?!
[02:12:03] <shoky> mm
[02:12:19] <wathek> shoky, it's relative
[02:12:23] <wathek> not absolute
[02:12:37] <shoky> now i reloaded and they dont have position set at all
[02:12:57] <shoky> ah sorry
[02:13:02] <wathek> shoky, look at their div
[02:13:03] <shoky> anyway that's not what i told you to do
[02:13:15] <shoky> leave them with position:absolute as you did before
[02:13:19] <wathek> ok
[02:13:23] <shoky> the _container_ should have position:relative
[02:13:29] <shoky> (and overflow:hidden)
[02:13:42] <wathek> the container you mean #main ?
[02:13:43] <M1k1> guys :D
[02:13:45] <shoky> wathek yeah
[02:13:53] <M1k1> can ask on jquery 1.8b2 not work fade in effect :)?
[02:13:59] <shoky> M1k1 you can ask
[02:14:01] <wathek> shoky, ok let me try that
[02:14:16] <M1k1> :)
[02:14:45] <wathek> shoky, yeah that works thank you man
[02:14:55] <shoky> ;]
[02:15:07] <wathek> shoky, thanks a lot
[02:16:24] <shoky> wathek np, if you wanna understand why what i suggested works, my favorite read on the subject is: http://punbb.informer.com/forums/topic/5293/css-relatively-absolute/
[02:16:39] <wathek> shoky, sure
[02:16:56] <wathek> shoky, excuse me to bother you I have one last problem with the resizable function of jquery-ui
[02:17:35] <shoky> sure
[02:18:15] <wathek> shoky, I'm adding a containment: "#main" so that the resized image won't go bigger than the container but as you can see I got the little icon at the bottom right but I cannot resize
[02:18:41] <wathek> shoky, however when I remove the containment: "#main" it works and I can resize but it could go bigger than the container
[02:20:40] <M1k1> anyone cal link jquery 1.8 development status link?
[02:23:24] <shoky> wathek: if i load your page, then in the console i do .resizable('destroy') on one of the penguin divs, then i re-do .resizable({containment:'#main'})
[02:23:28] <shoky> then it seems to work ok
[02:23:45] <shoky> so it's probably something to do with the order in which you're doing things.. i'm not sure
[02:24:06] <wathek> mmm
[02:25:13] <wathek> shoky, I'm doing this :http://pastebin.com/nQhUBhHB
[02:25:38] <wathek> shoky, so that when a user click on one of the icon at the bottom it'll load the page elements and make them draggable and resizable
[02:25:45] <shoky> are you triggering a click on page load or smth? ;p
[02:26:10] <wathek> shoky, yes
[02:26:32] <wathek> shoky, line 69 of main.js
[02:27:32] <shoky> how come your ajax response already has the resizable grips in it?
[02:27:35] <shoky> before you even call .resizable
[02:28:00] <wathek> huh ?
[02:28:20] <shoky> your ajax response is html that you are appending to #main
[02:28:36] <wathek> yes
[02:28:36] <shoky> that html already has in it: div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s" style="z-index: 1000; "></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s
[02:28:38] <shoky> and so on
[02:29:19] <wathek> shoky, those are added when calling the resizable function
[02:29:21] <wathek> let me remove it
[02:29:24] <shoky> no
[02:29:31] <shoky> they are there before calling the resizable function
[02:29:39] <shoky> d.data
[02:29:42] <shoky> has them already
[02:29:50] <rethus> how can i get an img-tag inside of the table "favorites" with each?
[02:29:57] <wathek> oh
[02:30:04] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/JUxzq/
[02:30:40] <wathek> shoky, I see that's because I'm saving the content of each div
[02:31:10] <wathek> shoky, and then loading it from the database I guess I need to remove those divs before saving
[02:31:22] <shoky> then you should remove the resizable stuff from it before saving, i suppose
[02:31:29] <shoky> .resizable('destroy') should do it
[02:31:38] <wathek> shoky, let me try that
[02:31:44] <shoky> or you should just save the actual data
[02:31:48] <shoky> and not html
[02:32:06] <shoky> that'd be cleanest and bestest
[02:32:11] <wathek> shoky, what do you mean by the actual data ?
[02:32:24] <shoky> the actual data that can change. like   top, left, width, height
[02:32:31] <shoky> whatever else your user can change
[02:33:03] <wathek> shoky, I'm already doing that but that's for the container and then I need to know if it's an image or a text so I'm saving the content too
[02:33:12] <martin2> Is there a way with jquery waypoints to only allow callback execution if the the last waypoint triggered has not been the same?
[02:33:14] <shoky> yeah but you're just copying the html
[02:33:21] <shoky> when you don't really need the html
[02:33:30] <shoky> you just need some specific data from it
[02:33:41] <wathek> shoky, yes
[02:34:42] <shoky> it'd be best if your server returned JSON with the relevant data
[02:34:58] <shoky> and your ajax handler would process that json and create the proper elements and add them
[02:35:09] <wathek> shoky, ok gonna try to do that
[02:35:34] <shoky> btw no idea if that would help with the issue at hand tho :P
[02:35:43] <wathek> shoky, let's try it ;)
[02:35:45] <shoky> but having the resizable artifacts inside the saved html is definitely bad
[02:35:56] <wathek> thank you shoky ;)
[02:36:02] <shoky> np
[03:01:58] <rethus> i have a strange problem:
[03:01:58] <rethus> i change the class of a span - which have an img inside - from list_mail to fav_mail.
[03:01:58] <rethus> than i have a $('fav_mail').click() but this is never fired... but all the time list_mail.
[03:02:02] <rethus> any idea why?
[03:03:19] <bwq> is that a straight copy paste?
[03:03:23] <bwq> because it should be .fav_mail
[03:03:33] <rethus> no, its only pseudocode
[03:04:03] <rethus> i even try $('.fav_mail').live('click....
[03:04:46] <rethus> but all the time, list_mail is fired... even if i use firebug...inspector and see, that the span is realy fav_mail
[03:04:51] <rethus> maybe have a look
[03:06:45] <Kit-10> rethus please do pastebin your code
[03:07:14] <Kit-10> oh btw, as a note. .click binds to the element, not to the class. change the class of an element and the event bound to it will not change
[03:08:45] <Kit-10> $('.fav_mail').click(fn); = $('.fav_mail').on('click', fn) = for every element at this time that has the class "fav_mail", bind an event listener to it that listens for the click event and fires fn
[03:09:10] <Kit-10> it doesn't care if it has a different class later, it still has an event to fire
[03:10:48] <Kit-10> rethus?
[03:11:53] <BinaryKitten> hey rethus, i just got a notice that you tried to pm me
[03:12:10] <rethus> yes, there is the link
[03:12:18] <BinaryKitten> didn't see it
[03:12:27] <BinaryKitten> just saw the notice that you had tried
[03:12:37] <BinaryKitten> pm spam filter
[03:12:54] <BinaryKitten> try posting the pastebin link in channel
[03:13:02] <rethus> mhh, i got no spam-question
[03:13:06] <BinaryKitten> oh look another notice rethus
[03:13:08] <rethus> to big for pastebin
[03:13:24] <BinaryKitten> rethus we/I cannot help you in a PM
[03:14:58] <rethus> Kit-10:  k - so tell me more about the event-listners...  $('.fav_mail').on('click', fn) will fire in scope of classname?
[03:15:10] <BinaryKitten> nope
[03:15:28] <BinaryKitten> it will bind the listener to all elements that match the selector at the time of calling
[03:16:00] <BinaryKitten> even if later it doesn't have the same class name
[03:16:29] <rethus> so i have to call this after change the class-attrib?
[03:16:50] <BinaryKitten> or use event delegation
[03:17:08] <rethus> how does this work?
[03:18:01] <BinaryKitten> you bind the event to the parent with the condition to fire when the click target meets certain criteria (selector)
[03:18:39] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/SyDdMgXP
[03:18:59] <rethus> would this work to set eventListner on the changed class-attrib
[03:19:11] <BinaryKitten> except that rebinds a new event everytime
[03:19:36] <BinaryKitten> so you could end up with multiple events firing for 1 element
[03:19:44] <BinaryKitten> i'm knocking up a fiddle for you
[03:25:30] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/JUxzq/1/
[03:26:34] <BinaryKitten> rethus http://jsfiddle.net/SZcL4/
[03:26:38] <BinaryKitten> simple example
[03:31:29] <BinaryKitten> rethus do you understand that example?
[03:32:11] <rethus> yes, i try to handle it on my code
[03:32:30] <BinaryKitten> looking at your fiddle
[03:32:41] <BinaryKitten> #favoriten_liste = parent
[03:33:15] <BinaryKitten> also, store $('#msg') somewhere
[03:33:33] <BinaryKitten> will save you on performance rather than having to dom search it every time
[03:36:53] <rethus> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/SZcL4/1/
[03:37:13] <BinaryKitten> rethus?
[03:37:19] <rethus> tab übersicht working well at all... mail-images in each line
[03:37:51] <rethus> but in tab "Favoriten", theres the fault... if you click on the mail-icon inside of the rows.
[03:38:15] <BinaryKitten> i don't see any favoriten tab
[03:38:23] <BinaryKitten> i just see my example without the js
[03:38:47] <rethus> BinaryKitten... look closer at the js-window
[03:39:09] <rethus> you see?
[03:39:38] <BinaryKitten> i see a link.. but not interested in linkls
[03:39:50] <rethus> thats the ap
[03:39:56] <rethus> you can see it live
[03:39:58] <BinaryKitten> i get paid to resolve issues first hand.
[03:40:12] <BinaryKitten> i don't mind helping and pointing in the right direction,
[03:40:44] <rethus> k, thanks, a pitty that it not solve my problem
[03:40:48] <BinaryKitten> and educating etc. that's what i'm here for... to learn and help

[04:23:08] <nVee>  http://jsfiddle.net/SN9dc/
[04:25:25] <rethus> nVee:  put html-code above, to create a working test-case
[04:25:42] <nVee> its all cakephp :/
[04:26:06] <nVee> i can paste the cake code which is mostly php, and the output is all in 1 long line, but let me see what I can do
[04:26:12] <rethus> nevertheless you can go to your output-page, mark your checkboxes in browser-sourcecode and paste it there
[04:26:36] <rethus> in browsersourcecode no php is visible ;)
[04:32:58] <Parhs> hello guys
[04:33:04] <Parhs> any idea why this doesnt wrap ?
[04:33:04] <Parhs> http://pastie.org/4294693
[04:34:47] <shoky> wathek: yay penguins ;]
[04:38:00] <shoky> Parhs: you're wrapping it, but you're only appending the element that you wrapped
[04:38:29] <shoky> Parhs: wrap() doesn't return the outer wrapper
[04:40:39] <shoky> Parhs: i guess you could do target.append(uploaderHtml.wrap("<div style='display:none'></div>").parent());   or  $('<div style='display:none'></div>').append(uploaderHtml).appendTo(target)
[04:41:01] <Parhs> thanks shoky i'll try
[04:41:10] <rethus>  nVee:  problem solved?
[04:41:39] <Parhs> it works thanks a lot..

[04:49:51] <geoid> yo yo
[04:50:08] <geoid> need some help with jquery form.serialize pls
[04:50:28] <geoid> it's not useful that it only includes checked and selected checkboxes / radio buttons.
[04:50:38] <geoid> is there any way around this?
[04:51:04] <cusco_> ?
[04:51:14] <geoid> like if I uncheck a checkbox, then I want my ajax submitted form to register that field as having a zero value, not just omitting the field.
[04:51:22] <cusco_> ow
[04:51:25] <venus_> hello, will $("#newsletter").insertAfter("#menu-item-220 a"); place newsletter div after menu-item-220 a ?
[04:52:07] <cusco_> venus_: try
[04:52:25] <venus_> tried it but it doesnt move it
[04:52:35] <venus_> http://www.rippledeep.com/
[04:53:04] <nVee> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/szNTv/
[04:53:10] <nVee> was on call quick
[04:54:43] <rethus> nVee: see no buttons
[04:55:13] <nVee> shit, its images haha
[04:55:21] <nVee> let me add quick
[04:55:23] <rethus> put a sniplet on jsfiddle, that should work like you want.. if it doesn't ask for help on base of it
[04:57:40] <nVee> http://jsfiddle.net/szNTv/1/
[04:57:48] <nVee> it does not work
[04:58:56] <dandbx> Anyone available to work right now for $20/hr?
[05:00:42] <cusco_> what do you need done?
[05:01:49] <gnarf> $20?
[05:03:10] <dandbx> That is correct.
[05:04:04] <xec_> nVee: what is the parent of .group_buttons?
[05:04:25] <xec_> nVee: the <span> right?
[05:04:39] <xec_> nVee: which contains no checkboxes
[05:08:37] <rethus> is tehre a way to show table only if jquery-plugin: dataTable is fully loaded
[05:08:52] <rethus> to prevent the switch of normal table to datatable-style?
[05:10:03] <nVee> xec_: thank you, I thought if I pass a parameter to parent('.controller_box') it will find the parent .controller_box class
[05:10:12] <nVee> is there a way to obtain what I want to do here?
[05:10:14] <xec_> ?closest @ nVee
[05:10:15] <bot-t> nVee, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:11:20] <nVee> hours of frustration, thank you xec_!!!
[05:11:22] <xec_> nVee: what you want is not a "parent" (only one parent element exist) but an "ancestor"
[05:11:37] <nVee> okay, so i should remember
[05:11:48] <nVee> parent is then the element right above?
[05:11:54] <nVee> so the parent of the element
[05:11:54] <xec_> so .parent(".controller_box") will look at the (first immediate) parent and not return anything if the selector doesnt match
[05:11:58] <nVee> that does make perfect sense
[05:12:06] <xec_> correct
[05:12:11] <nVee> thank you so much!
[05:12:14] <nVee> lesson learnt!
[05:12:17] <xec_> yw :)
[05:13:02] <xec_> you could also do .parent().parent() if you know you need to go two levels up
[05:18:31] <venus_> will $("#newsletter").insertAfter("#menu-item-220 a"); move newsletter after menu-item-220 a, i tried it but it is not doing so http://www.rippledeep.com/
[05:19:12] <dandbx> Anyone available to work right now for $25/hour?
[05:20:15] <rickibalboa> venus_, you'll need to tell it to insert after in an onclick event?
[05:25:12] <venus_> no ricki, onload
[05:25:16] <venus_> by default
[05:29:34] <dandbx> Anyone experienced in jQuery UI (draggable/droppable/resizable) available to work right now for $30/hour?
[05:49:38] <exalt> hello, when i got destination = $('a[href$="'+ document.location.href +'"]'); how can i get its address ? something like destination.attr('href') wont work
[05:51:37] <siovene> Hi. I have defined a function, and I later assign it to .change(). It works fine. At some point, I also want to call the same function manually, but if I do that, $(this) will be undefined. What can I do?
[05:52:46] <siovene> var on_change = function() { $(this).val('something'); }    $my_item.change(on_change);    on_change();
[06:05:52] <duc_> hey
[06:06:34] <duc_> i need to put some text element (i dont care if its an anchor, text, div, p, whatever) and make it dragable over an image, and i need the x,y of one of its corners
[06:06:37] <duc_> any known plugin for that?
[06:08:20] <duc_> or drag it over a div, and ill make the image be the background for that div or something
[06:10:16] <venus_> will $("#newsletter").insertAfter("#menu-item-220 a"); move newsletter after menu-item-220 a, i tried it but it is not doing so http://www.rippledeep.com/
[06:10:28] <siovene> duc_: jquery-ui has a drag & drop plugin.
[06:12:07] <duc_> awesome. thanks.
[06:19:10] <exalt> destination = $('a[href$="'+ document.location.href +'"]'); what is the atribute name to get the href value ?
[06:20:11] <xec_> exalt: i honestly don't know what you're after
[06:21:05] <xec_> the value of what href value? dont you have this in document.location.href?
[06:21:50] <exalt> xec_: i am still noob i guess this is an anchor object: $('a[href$="'+ document.location.href +'"]') . is that true ?
[06:23:36] <xec_> that code looks like its trying to select an anchor element, yes
[06:31:07] <huglester> hello everyone
[06:31:33] <huglester> Guys I'm somehow lost, I can't send json object to php... any good examples? somehow it just does not work..
[06:31:39] <huglester> is it possible? or maybe I'm missing smth
[06:34:20] <xec_> huglester: what have you tried?
[06:36:37] <huglester> xec_: mostly examples with JSON.stringify()
[06:37:08] <xmaddness> why not just send strait json?
[06:37:16] <Kingsy> guys, does jquery get() do something I am not aware of? I am populating an array inside of a get() function using ajax.. if I pass that array to another function after the call nothing happens.. however if I populate the array outside the get() ajax call everything works great
[06:37:29] <Kingsy> if there something you need to do after using ajax to return "normality" ?
[06:37:45] <xec_> huglester: show us your code, and explain what happens ("doesn't work" is less than useful)
[06:38:01] <xec_> ?p @ huglester
[06:38:02] <bot-t> huglester, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:38:06] <dabear> Kingsy: put all code dependant on the ajax result INSIDE the callback
[06:38:17] <dabear> ajax is async
[06:38:20] <Kingsy> dabear: ok good idea
[06:38:26] <Kingsy> async ?
[06:38:34] <dabear> as in not syncronious
[06:38:40] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ Kingsy
[06:38:40] <bot-t> Kingsy, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:39:42] <Kingsy> perfect :)
[06:39:50] <Kingsy> I need to remember that
[06:39:55] <huglester> xec_: oki thanks. I'm now putting all together from scratch, and see how it goes
[06:40:50] <Kingsy> xec_: hmm no actually that didnt fix it.. damn
[06:41:41] <duc_> how do i read ui.position - current position of the helper as { top, left } object, relative to the offset element
[06:41:56] <duc_> alert(ui.poisition) returns an Object
[06:42:05] <duc_> do i read it like ui.position[left] ?
[06:43:52] <Kingsy> xec_: are there any other things that may cause this? if you have everything inside the .get() ?
[06:45:48] <shoky> duc_: ui.position.left ;p
[06:46:56] <Kingsy> something is seriously wrong here, any click events I declare in the ajax call don't get set either
[06:48:26] <Kingsy> can someone see a problem with the way I am doing this --> http://pastie.org/4295157
[06:52:33] <xec_> Kingsy: "click events I declare in the ajax call" what?
[06:52:52] <Zlatev> is it normal $('select').val(value_attr); not to work in jquery 1.7.2 ?
[06:53:27] <xec_> (afk)
[06:59:44] <Kingsy> ok say I have a function like this --> http://pastie.org/4295186 <-- if I alert the images array before the return its full, if I   alert(getArray(whatever,whatever)); its undefined.. why ?
[07:05:34] <Zlatev> Kingsy you can't expect to return anything out of an async load from a function like that
[07:06:10] <Kingsy> Zlatev: so how could it be done? basically I need an array populated inside an ajax call
[07:06:12] <Zlatev> any async data needed should be loaded beforehand
[07:07:23] <Kingsy> Zlatev: could you show me a quick example of how its done?
[07:07:38] <Zlatev> just trigger any dependent functions from the ajax callback
[07:08:19] <Kingsy> Zlatev: but you still have to change an array at some point
[07:09:50] <Zlatev> yes. and the moment you got the data you trigger code that uses it
[07:10:09] <Zlatev> right after the row you populate that array
[07:13:01] <MiserShow> hey guys
[07:13:05] <Kingsy> Zlatev: can you show me what you mean on this --> http://jsfiddle.net/EfqTj/ <-- however I am not sure I am calling the .get() correctly.. I don't actually think its getting a response on the jsfiddle
[07:13:25] <MiserShow> could someone please tell me why my "slidedown" toggle is so screwed in ie: http://www.rdp-immo.com/wohnobjekte/
[07:13:33] <MiserShow> it works fine in chrome and ie
[07:13:37] <MiserShow> err
[07:13:40] <MiserShow> chrome and firefox
[07:13:49] <MiserShow> but in ie its just acting weird and sometimes not responidng at all
[07:15:09] <MiserShow> the code in question is located here: http://www.rdp-immo.com/wp-content/themes/Red.Properties/scripts/jquery.multiselect.js
[07:15:33] <MiserShow> starting at line 121
[07:16:03] <MiserShow> well actually the entire function ImmoCategoryToggle at line 112
[07:22:07] <Zlatev> Kingsy -> http://jsfiddle.net/mVbTf/
[07:25:17] <duc_>       $("#t1").text($(this).val());
[07:25:24] <duc_> i have a span with id t1
[07:25:34] <duc_> and $(this).val() alerts as "whatever"
[07:25:36] <duc_> and it wont change.
[07:25:41] <duc_> what am i missing
[07:30:46] <Kingsy> Zlatev: this is a total pain .. heh
[07:32:10] <Zlatev> painkillers goes well with ajax :p
[07:32:10] <shoky> duc_: $('#t1').text( function() { return $(this).val() } )
[07:32:23] <shoky> duc_ oh nvm sorry
[07:36:16] <salout> my small hide/unhide example doesn't work? what's wrong? http://pastie.org/4295339
[07:38:43] <xec_> salout: are the selectors working? "#collaps-video" ?
[07:41:51] <xec_> salout: just had a look at the url from the paste, looks like you have the same typo in the actual id too, so nevermind. but it doesnt seem like jquery is actually loaded
[07:42:12] <xec_> just typing "jQuery" in console returns "not defined"
[07:45:14] <xec_> salout: maybe try "1.7.2" as version number instead of "1.7.3"
[07:45:30] <salout> xec_: gonna try this
[07:47:13] <salout> xec_: jsapi reports "Module: 'jquery' with version '1.7.2' not found!" in Firebug.
[07:47:22] <salout> are you using firebug, too?
[07:48:02] <xec_> yes, but i got the error Error: Module: 'jquery' with version '1.7.3' not found!
[07:48:18] <xec_> and google.load("jquery", "1.7.2");  seems to work fine
[07:49:30] <salout> xec_: I changed this locally and it doesn't work for me
[07:50:01] <xec_> ok. try including jquery the normal way? just link to the cdn
[07:50:29] <salout> xec_: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-ajax-search-api/IhrAMrZec_8/0o5KHRaTJ2MJ
[07:50:40] <salout> looks like google.load is depreciated somehow
[07:55:16] <duc_> ok i have an issue with http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[07:55:26] <duc_> i get the same values from offset and position
[07:55:35] <duc_> both refer to the x and y relative to the page
[07:55:46] <xec_> ?demo @ duc_
[07:55:47] <bot-t> duc_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:56:41] <duc_> moment.
[08:02:07] <duc_> jsfiddle doesnt show it properly
[08:02:08] <duc_> http://jsfiddle.net/nfLg6/
[08:02:15] <duc_> it works locally tho
[08:03:27] <duc_> http://jsfiddle.net/nfLg6/1/
[08:03:28] <duc_> there
[08:03:32] <duc_> @xec_
[08:04:46] <xec_> duc_: ok, so what is the issue?
[08:05:08] <duc_> the x and y ui.offset ui.position
[08:05:16] <duc_> are supposed to be relative to the page or the container
[08:05:22] <duc_> and i get the relative for the page either way
[08:05:28] <duc_> like it doesnt recognize the div as being the container
[08:05:37] <duc_> like, the y will always be 21+
[08:07:18] <horrror> how hard it is to make my own wysiwyg
[08:07:35] <xmaddness> on your own?
[08:07:41] <xmaddness> probably pretty hard
[08:08:15] <xec_> horrror: depends on the features you need, very easy to make a simple one
[08:08:32] <horrror> xec_: awesome
[08:08:48] <xmaddness> gl with that
[08:08:49] <horrror> i want the simplest one + a few of my own plugins [youtube, vimeo]
[08:09:31] <b0bi> using .delegate, can I set the same event handler to multiple events at once?
[08:09:54] <xec_> duc_: make the container positioned
[08:10:20] <duc_> what do you mean?
[08:10:21] <xec_> duc_: http://jsfiddle.net/nfLg6/2/
[08:10:49] <xec_> duc_: as opposed to http://jsfiddle.net/nfLg6/3/
[08:11:37] <xec_> duc_: if you don't spot it, the difference is i added "position: relative;" to the div container
[08:11:41] <duc_> aw
[08:11:44] <duc_> thanks man
[08:11:46] <duc_> saved me hours.
[08:13:28] <Parhs> hello guys
[08:13:53] <Parhs> i am writing a jquery plugin for my application but needs another plugin in order to work.
[08:14:09] <xec_> horrror: this should get you started https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Midas
[08:15:08] <Parhs>  $.fn.mediaSelector = function(settings) {   this is where i define in.. Should i put code for the other plugin isnide here or outside that (inside (function($) {    closure) ?
[08:15:47] <Parhs> the problem is that if i put it outside then it is at another scope and it is difficult to cope with event handlers etc
[08:15:48] <shoky> Parhs: you shouldn't put code for one plugin inside code of another plugin
[08:16:04] <Parhs> shoky it is the initialization code not the plugin code
[08:18:07] <shoky> Parhs: (function($) { var localstaticvar = 'someInitStuff';  $.fn.mediaSelector = function(settings) { ... }; })(jQuery);
[08:19:03] <shoky> if it's static init-code for your plugin then put it in the closure scope, yes
[08:20:42] <Parhs> shoky inside this  function(settings) {   , i should initialize the third party plugin and depends on settings and i want callbacks..
[08:20:54] <Parhs> so should i put it within that closure ?
[08:20:59] <shoky> i don't know, depends what you're doing..
[08:21:31] <shoky> is this initialization to be done only once for your plugin? or for every time you call .mediaSelector(...)
[08:21:40] <Parhs> for every time
[08:22:03] <shoky> then only one of those options makes sense
[08:22:03] <Parhs> i have a plugin that displays photos from a collection. then if you click upload it should upload to that collection with several parameters
[08:22:37] <Parhs> the upload plugin is the third party and it is initialised with my plugin
[08:22:42] <Parhs> which ?
[08:23:03] <shoky> the code outside of $.fn.mediaSelector will only run once
[08:23:35] <scalex000> troll-boy, hi
[08:23:56] <shoky> so.. put it inside $.fn.mediaSelector if it needs to be run on every run of .mediaSelector(...) ..
[08:24:14] <marcomartins> Hi guys
[08:24:26] <marcomartins> I have a question using waypoints that is killing me
[08:24:29] <marcomartins> what I want:
[08:24:58] <marcomartins> a header that when I pass 80px of it it turns fixed on the top and fades in
[08:25:01] <Parhs> ok that is what i am going to .. it depends on mediaSelector settings, i guess this might be enough
[08:25:21] <marcomartins> and when I scroll up it fadeOut and fadeIn on its default position
[08:25:35] <marcomartins> I could make it work right when I scroll down
[08:25:41] <marcomartins> but when I scroll up
[08:25:48] <marcomartins> it fadesOut but don't fade in
[08:25:57] <marcomartins> just appears instantly on its default position
[08:26:00] <marcomartins> my code:
[08:26:18] <marcomartins>  		nav_container.waypoint({
[08:26:18] <marcomartins> 	    	handler: function(event, direction) {
[08:26:18] <marcomartins> 	        	if (direction == 'down'){
[08:26:19] <marcomartins> 	        	  	nav_container.css({ 'height':'33px', 'opacity': '0' });
[08:26:21] <marcomartins> 	  				nav_container.addClass('sticky').stop();
[08:26:23] <marcomartins> 	  				nav_container.animate({opacity:1}, 1000);
[08:26:25] <marcomartins> 	        		logo.delay(1000).animate({opacity:1}, 1000);
[08:26:26] <shoky> ..
[08:26:27] <marcomartins> 	        	}
[08:26:27] <shoky> shut up
[08:26:29] <marcomartins> 				else{
[08:26:31] <marcomartins> 					nav_container.fadeOut("slow", function() {
[08:26:33] <marcomartins> 						nav_container.removeClass('sticky').stop();
[08:26:35] <marcomartins> 						nav_container.css({ 'height':'auto' })
[08:26:37] <marcomartins> 						nav_container.fadeIn("slow");
[08:26:39] <marcomartins> 					});
[08:26:41] <marcomartins> 	        		logo.css('opacity',1).animate({opacity:0}, 1000);
[08:26:43] <marcomartins> 	        	}
[08:26:45] <marcomartins> 	    		},
[08:26:47] <marcomartins> 	    	offset: function() {
[08:26:49] <marcomartins>     			return -(nav_container.outerHeight()+80);
[08:26:51] <marcomartins>   			}	
[08:26:53] <marcomartins>   		});
[08:26:55] <marcomartins> 	});
[08:26:58] <shoky> ?p @ marcomartins
[08:26:59] <bot-t> marcomartins, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:28:03] <gnarf> marcomartins: IRC 101 - never paste anything more than one line or risk the ire of your peers
[08:28:13] <marcomartins> sorry
[08:28:17] <marcomartins> didn't know that
[08:28:22] <marcomartins> I'm not used to irc =/
[08:28:26] <marcomartins> where is the code
[08:28:26] <marcomartins> http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/
[08:29:34] <marcomartins> *here
[08:29:57] <b0bi> when I delegate the "change" event to an input, every keystroke should trigger my function right?
[08:30:06] <shoky> marcomartins: add html and css, and include the plugin as resource, so the fiddle works and demonstrates the issue
[08:30:46] <gnarf> b0bi: nope, only changing, then leaving focus
[08:30:56] <gnarf> b0bi: you probably want "keyup" if you want to detect every change
[08:30:57] <gnarf> or
[08:31:14] <gnarf> .bind( "keyup change input paste" ) if you really want to catch everything
[08:31:29] <b0bi> gnarf: mucho gracias
[08:31:43] <b0bi> can I use delegate in the same fashion?
[08:32:44] <gnarf> b0bi: yeah, what version of jQuery are you using?
[08:32:51] <gnarf> b0bi: you probably want on() anyway
[08:32:52] <gnarf> ?on
[08:32:53] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:34:53] <b0bi> gnarf: the latest stable one probably, i downloaded it a few days ago
[08:35:43] <b0bi> gnarf: I read that delegate is still relevant, so I need to throw it away from my vocabulary?
[08:36:11] <gnarf> b0bi: if you are using 1.7, use .on()
[08:36:35] <b0bi> gnarf: thanks, just curious, why is it better from delegate?
[08:36:49] <gnarf> bind, delegate, live are all different ways to call .on() : https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L955-977
[08:38:50] <gnarf> b0bi: so , if you use .on() directly, you skip a useless function calls :)
[08:41:16] <marcomartins> ok
[08:41:18] <marcomartins> here it goes
[08:41:19] <marcomartins> http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/8/
[08:41:29] <marcomartins> the scroll down works as expected
[08:41:34] <marcomartins> scroll up don't fade in element
[08:48:10] <gnarf> marcomartins: http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/9/
[08:48:38] <gnarf> marcomartins: fadeOut() sets opacity back to 1 and display: none when it is completed.
[08:51:23] <marcomartins> and the fadeIn changes the display: none to block in that case right?
[08:52:06] <gnarf> it should also set the opacity to 0, tbh, im not sure why it isn't
[08:52:17] <gnarf> but setting it by hand in the css works too
[08:52:34] <systemfault> fadeout sets opacity to 0.. fadeIn to 1 IIRC
[08:52:55] <systemfault> Ahhh.. when completed..
[08:53:55] <marcomartins> fadeIn should set opacity to 0? I think that it should start from 0 and go to 1 and set display: block
[08:53:57] <marcomartins> right?
[08:54:03] <shoky> how come that .delay(5000) doesn't have any effect
[08:54:54] <marcomartins> that would be my next question :p
[08:55:24] <gnarf> i'm not sure
[08:55:36] <shoky> if i change the .stop() to .stop(true,true)  then it does tho
[08:56:17] <shoky> er
[08:56:30] <shoky> scratch that
[08:57:20] <marcomartins> with true true mine never fades in
[08:57:25] <shoky> yea ;p
[08:57:53] <shoky> same thing if you just remove all the stop()'s
[08:58:34] <marcomartins> jquery is a mess :P I really can't understand its behavior! (i'm a noob)
[08:59:57] <gnarf> marcomartins: i just rewrote all of effects for 1.8 core and I can't figure out why this is behaving strange yet :)
[09:02:05] <gnarf> so
[09:02:06] <b-ot> gnarf, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[09:02:18] <gnarf> why are you calling .stop() on the first line of an animation callback
[09:02:25] <gnarf> I think this might be causing some weirdness
[09:03:28] <marcomartins> that was recommended to me
[09:03:38] <marcomartins> I just put it there...
[09:05:02] <shoky> without the .stop() it doesn't fade in
[09:05:45] <gnarf> well let me debunk that recommendation
[09:05:51] <gnarf> you are within an "animation callback"
[09:06:00] <gnarf> calling stop with no arguments means "end the current animation"
[09:06:18] <gnarf> while processing its callback, calling stop on the current animation my actually end the NEXT animation
[09:06:36] <gnarf> or somehow cause things to get out of order in the internal animation queues
[09:06:45] <gnarf> i do my best to make sure that doesn't happen
[09:06:50] <gnarf> but its really hard :)
[09:07:39] <marcomartins> so, I should remove the .stop?!
[09:08:09] <gnarf> probably - does it make sense to stop an animation while it is telling you it is ending?
[09:09:02] <marcomartins> but if remove them
[09:09:04] <gnarf> also
[09:09:06] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/13/
[09:09:06] <marcomartins> it don't work
[09:09:08] <gnarf> ^^^
[09:09:11] <gnarf> so
[09:09:12] <b-ot> gnarf, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[09:09:43] <gnarf> jQuery naturally has an "animation queue" so since the delay().fadeIn() happens after the fadeOut
[09:11:14] <gnarf> marcomartins: http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/15/
[09:11:27] <gnarf> marcomartins: basically, use the queue that is already there
[09:11:49] <gnarf> marcomartins: as far as why it works from outside the callback, but not inside, I'm not entirely sure
[09:12:36] <gnarf> marcomartins: and that kinda scares me, cuz I probably know the internals of effects better than anyone
[09:13:17] <gnarf> marcomartins: you have some strange voodoo hex on that bit of code, cause it seems like it shoulda worked how you had pasted it
[09:13:36] <marcomartins> indeed
[09:13:46] <marcomartins> I was killing myself reading the api
[09:13:59] <marcomartins> and trying every combination I tought it might make sense
[09:14:08] <marcomartins> and never worked
[09:14:25] <marcomartins> this last revision you put again the stop
[09:14:31] <gnarf> marcomartins: outside the callback though
[09:14:34] <marcomartins> should I keep it or delete it?
[09:14:51] <gnarf> marcomartins: stop( true, true ) will basically empty the queue, and stop the current animation
[09:15:09] <gnarf> so it finishes its fadeIn before it fadesOut
[09:15:14] <gnarf> if you scroll down then up too quick
[09:15:32] <gnarf> or it should
[09:18:45] <marcomartins> ah ok
[09:21:17] <marcomartins> so if it is fadin in and I scroll to top it will stop the fadein and fadeout?
[09:21:54] <gnarf> yup
[09:22:33] <marcomartins> but try this: scroll down until it starts fadeIN
[09:22:34] <marcomartins> and then
[09:22:42] <marcomartins> scroll quickly up
[09:23:03] <marcomartins> the bar disappear and don't fadeIn in its default position
[09:23:14] <gnarf> marcomartins: it does for me
[09:24:00] <gnarf> in chrome
[09:24:06] <marcomartins> I'm in chrome too
[09:24:14] <marcomartins> latest dev revision
[09:24:47] <gnarf> oh
[09:24:51] <gnarf> marcomartins: i made a change
[09:24:54] <marcomartins> you must scroll up very quick as soon as you see the fadeIn
[09:25:03] <gnarf> marcomartins: the .stop( true, true ) should come before the .css() in the first half
[09:25:21] <gnarf> actually
[09:25:27] <gnarf> just remove it from both parts of the if
[09:25:32] <gnarf> and just make it the first statement in the function
[09:25:44] <gnarf> first thing you do - stop the current animations
[09:25:45] <marcomartins> ah ok like the else
[09:26:23] <gnarf> you might want to add logo.stop( true, true ) as well
[09:27:24] <gnarf> marcomartins: http://jsfiddle.net/kQaJV/17/
[09:28:01] <marcomartins> wow :)
[09:28:21] <marcomartins> now it is working as expected
[09:28:26] <marcomartins> thank you so much gnarf!
[09:28:42] <gnarf> marcomartins: np, sorry you ran into such a strange bug in the middle of that
[09:29:31] <marcomartins> no problem
[09:30:18] <marcomartins> as I've said I'm very new to js and jquery but this behavior was making me doubt about my perception on them =P
[09:31:29] <marcomartins> because I tought that what I was writing made sense
[09:32:46] <gnarf> marcomartins: it did mostly - not sure why it wasn't working, some strange thing having to do with a complete callback it seems
[09:36:40] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/f3PBb/2/ having problems with this, under the carousel links (the pink circles in the content section) there is a huge gap between that, and the black bar. Removing the clearfix below it removes that extra spacing, but obviously causes an overlap.
[09:37:05] <JLT> it's like adding an extra 20px with no margins causing it. there is a margin on the black bar, however i changed that to a padding and it did not help.
[09:40:39] <JLT> wait why am i in jquery.
[09:40:40] <JLT> -.-
[09:40:42] <JLT> sorry guys.
[09:41:13] <robdodson> GTFO!

[09:42:21] <aslamhammad> hello
[09:42:31] <aslamhammad> any body there?
[09:43:16] <xec_> ?ask @ aslamhammad
[09:43:16] <bot-t> aslamhammad, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:44:04] <thomedy> okay if i do $(this).attr('href') is that the equivalent of function(e){e.target.href;}
[09:44:14] <thomedy> cuz it doest seem to be
[09:44:26] <gnarf> e.target != this
[09:44:27] <Haprog> depends on the context
[09:44:54] <gnarf> thomedy: also
[09:45:00] <gnarf> thomedy: why not just e.target.href ?
[09:45:00] <thomedy> okay let me run a fiddle and you can help me if your willing cuz $(this).attr('href')
[09:45:17] <thomedy> does the trick
[09:45:23] <thomedy> but the jquery is really laggin my animations
[09:45:25] <aslamhammad> well i'm tyring to get all banners from a folder and want to use banner rotation with hyper links that a user submits and uploads....what you guys advise to use jquery or php and mysql?
[09:45:29] <gnarf> thomedy: then "this.href" ?
[09:45:43] <thomedy> i wanted to do that i started with that
[09:45:56] <thomedy> but  my function wont let me put this in so i thinkim doing the this as a param wrong but i
[09:46:01] <thomedy> in googling thats what i found
[09:46:04] <thomedy> so i started that path
[09:46:18] <thomedy> okay fiddle
[09:46:19] <thomedy> first
[09:46:58] <aslamhammad> anybody can help?
[09:48:08] <aslamhammad> hello
[09:48:28] <marcomartins> gnarf, I'm getting this on the last line of the js code: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[09:48:36] <gnarf> aslamhammad: you will likely need server side languages to handle the "submission" (php) and "persistence" (mysql) - how does jQuery help you?
[09:49:00] <gnarf> marcomartins: sounds like a bad bit of code copied in a whitespace somewhere
[09:49:13] <gnarf> marcomartins: try removing all whitespace and putting it back in
[09:49:19] <aslamhammad> i think i will need jquery as well to display the banners
[09:49:30] <marcomartins> btw how can i mention you like you do?
[09:49:52] <aslamhammad> can we store images in mysql?
[09:49:53] <gnarf> marcomartins: most IRC clients have tab completion for nicks
[09:49:57] <aslamhammad> i'm newbie in php :p
[09:50:09] <gnarf> aslamhammad: go google and read
[09:50:11] <gnarf> ?101
[09:50:12] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[09:50:12] <marcomartins> gnarf: ah ok mine has
[09:50:13] <gnarf> ?learn
[09:50:14] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:50:15] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/zKVK5/1/
[09:50:19] <thomedy> okay quick fiddle
[09:50:36] <aslamhammad> i did :p
[09:50:45] <gnarf> aslamhammad: read more
[09:50:49] <aslamhammad> lol
[09:50:57] <gnarf> thomedy: giant wall of code
[09:50:59] <gnarf> thomedy: reduce it
[09:50:59] <aslamhammad> any shortcut's? :P
[09:51:10] <thomedy> you knwo whats funny i tried the reduce thing earlier
[09:51:15] <gnarf> aslamhammad: yeah, spend 15+ years working in the web
[09:51:20] <thomedy> and everyone was like a short bit of code doesn't help
[09:51:26] <thomedy> so i started doing the whole thing
[09:51:26] <thomedy> ha ha
[09:51:29] <aslamhammad> lol
[09:51:30] <thomedy> okay reduced in a sec
[09:51:30] <gnarf> thomedy: sometimes you need more context
[09:51:31] <thomedy> sorry
[09:51:38] <aslamhammad> man i'm kind of short of time
[09:51:47] <aslamhammad> i'm making my final year project
[09:51:50] <aslamhammad> on seo link engine :)
[09:51:51] <thomedy> ill leave that thougha nd do another more concise version
[09:51:56] <gnarf> thomedy: like "$(this).attr('href')" means nothing
[09:52:17] <thomedy> no waht i mean was i made a fiddle of just the relevant function(this was like a week or more ago)
[09:52:24] <thomedy> and they were linke MORE CODE MORE CODE
[09:52:52] <gnarf> thomedy: well was the error inside that function in the end? or perhaps someone didn't understand the context in which that function was called, or maybe the fiddle didn't actually DO anything
[09:53:00] <gnarf> all of the above are reasons to ask for more
[09:53:14] <aslamhammad> any recommended links?
[09:53:31] <Parhs> hello guys.. is there an easy way to have loading or something   while waiting for ajax call ?
[09:53:36] <gnarf> but to assist with a small focused problem like "this" vs "e.target" & ".attr('href')" vs ".href" - you likely only need a single event handler bound to a click on a document
[09:53:42] <thomedy> no worries i just thought it was funny
[09:53:46] <thomedy> one sec im almost done
[09:54:21] <gnarf> Parhs: element.addClass('loading'); $.ajax(...).done(function() { element.removeClass('loading'); }
[09:55:24] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/sXC7s/
[09:55:24] <aslamhammad> ok guys i'm going now
[09:55:27] <aslamhammad> bye
[09:55:37] <gnarf> thomedy: see
[09:55:43] <gnarf> thomedy: you've made a mistake already
[09:55:47] <gnarf> there is a syntax error
[09:55:47] <Parhs> gnarf if element has other stuff it seems dificult
[09:55:55] <gnarf> you aren't including jquery
[09:55:59] <gnarf> and it doesn't actually do anything
[09:55:59] <gnarf> :)
[09:56:00] <thomedy> i dont want jquery
[09:56:00] <Parhs> maybe i should clear it
[09:56:04] <thomedy> thats the thing
[09:56:07] <thomedy> im removing jquery
[09:56:11] <thomedy> i want just the js
[09:56:18] <thomedy> thats why i am asking the equivalent
[09:56:21] <thomedy> my jquery is fine
[09:56:32] <thomedy> but jquery is slowing down my canvas animation
[09:56:36] <thomedy> i am pretty sure
[09:56:43] <thomedy> cuz when i remove it it is smoother
[09:56:53] <thomedy> youll note the other fiddle is purejs no wrap
[09:57:29] <gnarf> thomedy: here: http://jsfiddle.net/3NFKG/
[09:57:38] <gnarf> thomedy: thats a reduced fiddle
[09:57:51] <gnarf> it does something
[09:57:59] <gnarf> like show you that element.href is the elements href
[09:58:33] <gnarf> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/3NFKG/1/
[09:58:33] <thomedy> okay so then i hate to say it but the original fiddle would have been better ac tually let me do this
[09:58:52] <thomedy> cuz some context in a greate scale would have helped im sorry for the confusing
[09:58:59] <thomedy> the thing is tha tsome have parent elements and some are the elements
[09:59:07] <gnarf> so?
[09:59:11] <thomedy> and sometimes its the parent elements href i want
[09:59:13] <thomedy> anyway
[09:59:16] <thomedy> let me fiddle small
[09:59:18] <gnarf> so then find the parent
[09:59:21] <gnarf> and get its href
[09:59:34] <thomedy> whats weird is ().attr(href)
[09:59:37] <thomedy> did that for me
[09:59:46] <thomedy> unless i missed something
[09:59:48] <gnarf> nope
[09:59:55] <thomedy> okay so no it didn't
[09:59:59] <thomedy> thats fine
[10:00:04] <thomedy> hmmm...
[10:00:06] <gnarf> $( elem ).attr( 'href' ) is basically returning elem.href;
[10:00:22] <thomedy> thats funny cuz thats what i had to start this whole process
[10:00:43] <thomedy> oh you know what... let me see something
[10:00:51] <thomedy> sometimes i forget the browser caches too
[10:00:58] <thomedy> thats annoying by the way
[10:01:01] <thomedy> its good
[10:01:06] <gnarf> thomedy: use chrome and turn off cache
[10:01:12] <thomedy> but i always forget that so it makese me think i screwed something up
[10:01:33] <gnarf> thomedy: in the "cog wheel" settings inside chromes web inspector you can disable caching
[10:01:47] <thomedy> actually i think i will do that i think it will help
[10:02:05] <gnarf> only disables cache when inspector is open, kinda handy
[10:02:53] <thomedy> sounds awesome
[10:02:55] <thomedy> thank you
[10:02:59] <thomedy> im not surei f that was the problem
[10:03:05] <thomedy> but i know what you recommended is what i did
[10:03:09] <thomedy> but here we go
[10:03:17] <gnarf> thomedy: also, jQuery is likely not causing your slowness, but more likely you are abusing some expensive operation in jQuery that is causing it... like if you are asking the DOM for a selection every frame of your animation
[10:04:01] <gnarf> thomedy: or doing pointless things like $( this ).attr( 'href' ) when this.href is like 5 less function calls
[10:04:14] <thomedy> okay thats good to know
[10:04:15] <thomedy> question
[10:04:29] <thomedy> if you ll look at the original fiddle youll see theres not much jquery in there...
[10:04:37] <thomedy> and all my dom calls i feel like i have cached
[10:04:40] <thomedy> i think at least
[10:04:51] <thomedy> but i am animating some massive images
[10:05:01] <thomedy> pngs and jpgs at full screen
[10:05:08] <thomedy> if i shrink my window they animate fine
[10:05:14] <thomedy> but i cant do that to my user
[10:05:54] <thomedy> this is a huge favor and you are by no means  responsible for my code... but any suggestions
[10:06:08] <thomedy> ill also link the live version which is not the one im tweaking rightnow
[10:06:13] <thomedy> its a canvas tag
[10:06:21] <thomedy> which has had themost benefet so far
[10:06:28] <thomedy> i was just animating divs
[10:06:43] <thomedy> but my markup was so heavy and so much was happening the animation was sluggish
[10:06:49] <thomedy> in mozilla its fine
[10:06:50] <gnarf> thomedy: performance is usually a matter of in order: a) reducing dom operations, b) reducing function calls, c) reducing "temporary" object usage (garbage collection is expensive)
[10:06:52] <thomedy> for the most part
[10:07:01] <thomedy> okay
[10:07:02] <thomedy> cool
[10:07:24] <thomedy> thats actually REALLY helpful
[10:07:25] <thomedy> thank you
[10:07:32] <gnarf> it doesn't matter how many functions you are calling, if you are calling a DOM operation every iteration
[10:07:35] <gnarf> DOM is slow as shit
[10:07:44] <thomedy> temporary object example please
[10:07:53] <gnarf> var a={}; a={};
[10:07:55] <thomedy> most of mine are part of the object
[10:07:56] <thomedy> okay
[10:07:57] <thomedy> cool
[10:07:58] <gnarf> the first one gets thrown away
[10:08:04] <gnarf> garbage collection is expensive
[10:08:09] <thomedy> oh wait whats the diifference
[10:08:15] <thomedy>  i thought i needed var for a
[10:08:23] <thomedy> and w/o it was part of window
[10:08:28] <thomedy> and i read that was bad
[10:08:34] <gnarf> thomedy: meaning var a={}; ....; a={}; --- the first "a" is deleted
[10:08:44] <gnarf> thomedy: not don't use var
[10:08:50] <thomedy> hmmm
[10:08:53] <thomedy> i have a fiew vars
[10:09:00] <thomedy> ill google the difference
[10:09:04] <gnarf> i mean to say that the object referenced by "a" is overwritten by a new empty object
[10:09:13] <gnarf> which means the old one is no longer referenced
[10:09:16] <thomedy> i freakin love code
[10:09:18] <gnarf> so it gets collected
[10:09:36] <gnarf> its also the reason it was like C) on the list
[10:09:48] <gnarf> if you are working for performance, 99% of the time your bottleneck is DOM
[10:10:00] <gnarf> 0.5% of the time its excessive function calling
[10:10:15] <thomedy> my dom is so limeted now i think its basically a canvas tag and some 2 uls
[10:10:20] <thomedy> with 8 lis in each
[10:10:35] <thomedy> but i might still have 2 much
[10:10:40] <gnarf> ?g paul irish dom reflow
[10:10:43] <bot-t> gnarf, DOM, HTML5, & CSS3 Performance  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2011/dom-html5-css3-performance/
[10:11:23] <thomedy> that looks freakin aweosme as soon as our conversation is over im watching that
[10:11:47] <thomedy> do you really think that (looking back at my original fiddle) my dom is that expenive
[10:11:50] <thomedy> expensive
[10:13:06] <gnarf> thomedy: tbh - i've only glanced at it, that style of code is hard for me to read nowadays, and I don't really have a huge desire to compile it in my head - there is a lot going on
[10:15:28] <thomedy> no worries
[10:15:30] <thomedy>  not your job
[10:15:44] <thomedy> i really appreciat ethat tidbit about performance issues
[10:15:48] <thomedy> very very very helpful
[10:15:57] <gnarf> thomedy: realistically, you should be able to use css3 transitions for that effect though
[10:16:05] <thomedy> nope i did that too
[10:16:10] <thomedy> this is not my first recode
[10:16:16] <thomedy> i started with jquery
[10:16:22] <thomedy> then switched to css3
[10:16:30] <thomedy> then switched to something else
[10:16:36] <thomedy> no im canvas straight js
[10:16:41] <thomedy> this is the most effective
[10:16:53] <thomedy> prob canvas doing the most work though
[10:17:53] <gnarf> thomedy: full screen image animations are just generally not very performant
[10:18:19] <gnarf> thomedy: its a lot of redrawing going on, and a lot of pixels to be calculated, and browsers aren't very optimized for large scale animation like that
[10:18:32] <thomedy> i know
[10:18:48] <johnline> yeah i've come up against this all too often with slideshows that run fullscreen
[10:19:02] <gnarf> you can't expect it to look great in old browsers, and even on new ones its going to chop
[10:19:08] <johnline> wonder if using canvas would be gpu accelerated?
[10:19:13] <gnarf> such is the nature of browser based animations
[10:19:20] <gnarf> johnline: css3 can be gpu accelerated
[10:19:31] <gnarf> johnline: canvas can use a few, but most implementations dont
[10:20:06] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/ heres the site
[10:41:56] <jga> is this the right syntax for custom builds? ./node_modules/.bin/grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-dimensions,-effects,-offset
[10:44:21] <ner0x> Any way to set the button text properly? It just shows "yes_text" right now: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/203201
[10:53:42] <shoky> ner0x: http://pastebin.com/TN4F2GN8
[11:08:30] <gnarf> jga: that should work, but you probably have npm install -g grunt
[11:08:47] <gnarf> so you can just "grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-dimensions,-effects,-offset"
[11:13:55] <jga> gnarf: thanks, that was the problem
[11:13:59] <jga> not sure why though
[11:14:17] <jga> npm install puts the same version of grunt into node_modules
[11:19:35] <gnarf> jga: yeah, npm install -g still runs the version from node_modules if it's there
[11:20:35] <jga> huh, that makes even more odd
[11:20:52] <jga> nothing was building until I npm install -g
[11:21:31] <gnarf> jga: i think the "custom" task
[11:21:38] <gnarf> actually spawns "grunt build...."
[11:21:47] <gnarf> so if you don't have the -g install, it can't find it then ^^^
[11:22:06] <gnarf> because node_modules/.bin isn't in your path
[11:22:15] <jga> makes sense
[11:23:12] <abjorn> HI
[11:23:17] <abjorn> SUP GUISE
[11:39:20] <b0bi> how can i query all the a objects that are the childs of $(this) ?
[11:42:36] <b0bi> by "a" i ment anchor objects
[11:50:21] <BinaryKitten> b0bi $(this).find('a')
[12:07:24] <hkhalid> hello, I am trying to shorten a string, many posts say just use substring, which I did but its not including the spaces, its only including the characters of actual words
[12:07:38] <hkhalid> Is there a way to make it count the blank spaces between words as characters?
[12:07:45] <gnarf> hkhalid: it does
[12:08:00] <gnarf> hkhalid: you must have a copy of the string without spaces
[12:08:03] <gnarf> or something
[12:08:27] <gnarf> ?js "omg one two three".substring( 6, 6 )
[12:08:35] * gnarf frowns - no bot-t
[12:09:39] <hkhalid> gnarf, its strange, im using a rss feed via zrssfeed to parse it all, so when I take entry.title for example, many different feeds entry.titles' are different...they should all have the same legnth but they are all diferent
[12:09:58] <hkhalid> and it seems its due to spaces between words, not actual length of entire string of entry.title
[12:10:07] <saschagehlich> hey, does anybody have a working solution on how to reload a fb share button?
[12:10:07] <hkhalid> I shall look more into it gnarf thanks
[12:10:20] <ner0x> shoky: Thank you, that worked.
[12:11:14] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich if you mean reparse it because it was loaded dynamically, then look at FB.XFBML.parse
[12:11:35] <garrilla> i'm trying to test if an element does not exist - should !$(".pp_overlay") work?
[12:11:42] <saschagehlich> LocalPCGuy: but FB.XFBML.parse does only work for comment widgets and stuff like that, right?
[12:12:34] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich sorry, was thinking of the widgets (Like button) - not sure what you want to reload then
[12:12:35] <BinaryKitten> garrilla  unfortunately that won't work
[12:12:54] <saschagehlich> a share button, not a like button
[12:12:56] <LocalPCGuy> garrilla test the length - if 0, didn't exist
[12:13:04] <saschagehlich> (i know that they are deprecated, but they are much more effective than like buttons)
[12:13:05] <BinaryKitten> garrilla but $(".pp_overlay").length != 0
[12:13:38] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich I use the share dialog now, rather than the deprecated sharer.php link
[12:14:18] <garrilla> beautiful - thanks very much - solved my shit!
[12:14:30] <saschagehlich> LocalPCGuy: well what i do is including "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share" and creating a link with name=fb_share… is there a better way that is supported by FB.XFBML.parse?
[12:14:31] <BinaryKitten> prunes would do that too
[12:14:47] <bwq> so guys, what's the going rate for a web app?
[12:14:58] <bwq> compared to a normal website
[12:15:05] <BinaryKitten> bwq depends on the specifications
[12:15:17] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/
[12:15:21] <bwq> i understand, but on average
[12:15:29] <bwq> i assume it's quite a big difference compared to a normal website
[12:15:34] <bwq> considering the extra work it takes
[12:15:35] <BinaryKitten> bwq there is no such thing as an average
[12:15:49] <BinaryKitten> each job is unique, thus each cost is unique
[12:15:55] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich you can just popup the  dialog in a new window, and you can attach it to a custom designed share btn
[12:16:02] <bwq> surely there's a minimum
[12:16:11] <bwq> and a maximum you've charged before :)
[12:16:24] <LocalPCGuy> saschagehlich I just use the Direct URL example, not the FB.ui version, generally
[12:16:34] <BinaryKitten> bwq not really no
[12:16:50] <BinaryKitten> client charges are client priveledged information
[12:16:59] <bwq> how do you decide what to charge then?
[12:17:15] <BinaryKitten> it's based on the business requirements and specifications presented
[12:18:09] <bwq> i know, i'm asking if you have a list or something, maybe even in your mind, of certain features that would cost ~ this much to add
[12:18:47] <bwq> silly example, i ask you to implement a table in an admin back-end where i can add/remove/edit entries
[12:19:01] <bwq> how would you decide the pricing for that feature specifically
[12:19:29] <LocalPCGuy> bwq I would figure out how many hours I thought it would take to build, and charge my hourly rate @ that number of hours
[12:19:54] <bwq> gotcha
[12:20:22] <LocalPCGuy> bwq if that is out of budget for the client, then we part ways or try to find a compromise on scope/price
[12:20:58] <LocalPCGuy> bwq and always add some extra hours, cause there will be things you don't anticipate
[12:21:18] <bwq> and let's say someone asks you to create a proper web application, something that you think will have a major impact
[12:21:30] <bwq> do you charge extra for that, since you know it will be worth a lot?
[12:21:53] <BinaryKitten> bwq the work is generally charged at the same rate, no matter what the site is
[12:22:06] <gob> bwq: if you gotta ask, chances are you won't be presented with a project like that
[12:22:53] <gob> and the answer is no, you don't charge extra based on gambling
[12:23:17] <gob> or assumptions of value to third parties
[12:24:04] <gob> unless you're an entrepreneur. as that is, in part, what an entrepreneur does.
[12:24:12] <gob> but the situation would be different
[12:25:20] <LocalPCGuy> bwq there is such a thing as "Value based pricing" - basing the price on the percieved value of the project or results.  You could get residuals or percentage of profits, or ask for a higher fee up front.
[12:25:41] <LocalPCGuy> bwq but a higher fee is generally going to cause you to lose to other devs
[12:26:06] <LocalPCGuy> bwq unless you are well known as the "go-to dev" for that kind of project
[12:26:51] <LocalPCGuy> bwq and in my experience, if the client is going to pay residuals/% of profits, they are generally going to want the initial fee lowered, and then you are the one gambling
[12:29:57] <bwq> i see, very interesting
[12:29:59] <bwq> thanks guys :)
[12:31:14] <bwq> "a higher fee is generally going to cause you to lose to other devs"
[12:31:22] <bwq> true, LocalPCGuy, didn't even have that in mind
[12:31:58] <LocalPCGuy> bwq a lot of that depends on your relationship with the client of course
[12:32:01] <bwq> but i'm guessing the pricing for high-end projects such as those is already high from the start, compared to "normal" websites
[12:32:13] <bwq> yeah
[12:32:25] <gnarf> bwq: i don't remember the last "normal" website i worked on
[12:32:30] <gnarf> its not worth the money
[12:32:52] <bwq> well, it's just a very, very broad generalization of mine
[12:33:01] <bwq> by normal website i don't mean a static html website
[12:33:32] <gnarf> bwq: jquery.com - normal?
[12:33:33] <bwq> i mean any decent website that doesn't really have a lot of back-end stuff going on
[12:33:39] <bwq> yes
[12:34:30] <gnarf> bwq: most of my work anymore is in libraries
[12:34:59] <gnarf> bwq: "normal" sites are pretty damn complex, and filled with expectations
[12:35:17] <gnarf> also, IANAD therefore, I don't have to do much for these sorts of sites
[12:36:14] <gnarf> i find that unless you're a designer, or working for one
[12:36:40] <gnarf> programming "normal sites" isn't very lucrative
[12:37:34] <bwq> don't well designed sites easily go for over 1-2k?
[12:38:07] <gnarf> bwq: "well designed"
[12:38:34] <bwq> aesthetically
[12:38:57] <ajpiano> they go for a hell of a lot more than that
[12:39:20] <bwq> yeah, that's what i figured
[12:39:26] <LocalPCGuy> 1-2k should be the absolute base these days for a freelancer with no experience just starting out on a brochureware site
[12:39:29] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[12:39:56] <bwq> wow, seriously?
[12:40:28] <LocalPCGuy> $1000 is 12.5 hours at $80/hour
[12:40:36] <ajpiano> ^^
[12:40:43] <LocalPCGuy> not really sure how "high quality" you are going to get in 12.5 hours
[12:40:48] <ajpiano> yeah i was about to say, 1-2 might get you through a day or two depending on the designer
[12:41:26] <bwq> you can actually charge $80 an hour as a starter?
[12:41:59] <ajpiano> no
[12:42:32] <ajpiano> he's saying that a "starter" doing freelance could charge 1-2k for the entire project
[12:42:56] <ajpiano> but a professional will charge you $80... and up
[12:43:23] <bwq> but well, if you can do it in 12.5 hours, then it pretty much comes down to you making $80 an hour, right?
[12:43:33] <hkhalid> gnarf, http://jsfiddle.net/Ewnzj/2/ shouldnt substring make it where the blank space is the 6th character?
[12:43:36] <bwq> just without your client actually knowing how much time you put into it
[12:43:49] <LocalPCGuy> I'm also considering that a starter will likely be talking to small business owners and the like with smaller budgets
[12:43:59] <hkhalid> gnarf, shit, I think im using wrong function
[12:44:11] <ajpiano> bwq: you also don't have to tell the client you rode a unicorn doing it either, cause how you'll be finished with the entire job in 12.5 hours
[12:44:21] <bwq> :D
[12:44:24] <ajpiano> probably involves magic too ;)
[12:44:37] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[12:45:36] <hkhalid> ajpiano, is piano your last name
[12:45:39] <bwq> you guys probably think i'm a huge newbie but i'm just inquiring really. was very interested in the actual going rate because i don't have a clue myself
[12:45:48] <ajpiano> hkhalid:
[12:45:50] <ajpiano> no
[12:46:00] <ajpiano> bwq: you could just pretend to be a client and get quotes from your "competitors"
[12:46:01] <ajpiano> and then bam
[12:46:04] <ajpiano> now you know everyones rates
[12:46:05] <ajpiano> ;)
[12:46:09] <bwq> haha true
[12:46:44] <bwq> the thing is, my brother has been designing websites for a small agency during his spare time
[12:47:02] <bwq> but he's still in college so he can't earn too much
[12:47:10] <bwq> so they pay him 150 EUR per site
[12:47:40] <bwq> shame they pay him so little since he probably knows too that they probably charge 10 times that, easily
[12:48:17] <LocalPCGuy> bwq agencies can (and frequently do) charge in excess of $100k for websites
[12:48:40] <bwq> not gonna tell him that :D
[12:50:04] <LocalPCGuy> bwq of course, they usually have a large team of developers/designers/ia/marketing/etc to justify the cost
[12:50:17] <LocalPCGuy> not a single guy just knocking them out
[12:50:49] <bwq> yeah indeed
[12:51:30] <bwq> this guy just hires graphical artists from college and has them create pretty much everything
[12:51:36] <bwq> even logo design
[12:51:41] <bwq> pretty sure he makes a hefty profit
[12:51:51] <dan__> I have clickable data rows, but also buttons inside the data rows.  My problem is that when I register the clickable row and the button separately with ".on()", clicking the button fires the row click callback as well as the button callback.  What's the best way to exclude specific elements from an ".on" selector?
[12:54:01] <bwq> LocalPCGuy: so from my understanding, the web apps i'm talking about, compared to "normal websites", a designer could probably charge 50k for that easily, no?
[12:54:37] <bwq> sorry, i'm having a hard time defining exactly what i mean so not sure you guys know what i mean
[12:55:33] <bwq> because in that case, i definitely understand the mindset of charging every project at the same rate
[12:55:40] <LocalPCGuy> bwq sure, depends how capable the person is and what kind of business they are targeting.  You aren't going to get a 50K contract from your local pet store website, generally, no matter how great it is
[12:56:05] <bwq> definitely
[12:58:11] <bwq> because yeah, it just sounded weird to me that you'd design a web app that you know could be used by thousands and then charge 2k for it (which was my understanding 30 mins ago when i didn't have a clue about the going rate)
[12:58:41] <exalt> hey, how can i use the same funtion on multiple triggers something like this: $('li.menu_item a', '#blog_menu_item a').click(function() { ...the function });
[12:58:41] <LocalPCGuy> dan you could use :not in your selector perhaps
[12:59:28] <LocalPCGuy> bwq if it's only used by 1000s then it might only be worth 2k, you might want to charge hourly for that one ;)
[12:59:54] <bwq> haha :D
[13:01:33] <LocalPCGuy> exalt I think you just showed how to do it, except only one set of quotes around all the affected selectors
[13:05:49] <dan__> exalt $('li.menu_item a, #blog_menu_item a').click should do it..
[13:28:35] <Crumbz> Hey guys, trying to bind an event handler for elements that are dynamically generated. at the time of initial document parse the fields do not exist, they are dynamically generated, this is the code i was attempting to use: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1710595
[13:28:40] <Crumbz> where am i going wrong?
[13:28:55] <Crumbz> i thought on() will attach event handlers for elements dynamically created?
[13:29:43] <LocalPCGuy> Crumbz: it will, but in that case you are binding to the elements directly
[13:30:14] <LocalPCGuy> Crumbz: you want to bind to a parent element that is always there, and execute when the click was on the element that is dynamic
[13:30:56] <LocalPCGuy> Crumbz: $('.credentialFieldsParentDiv').on('click', '.credentialFields', function... );
[13:31:06] <LocalPCGuy> make sense?
[13:31:28] <Crumbz> LocalPCGuy, yes but there are two fields that will be in the parent div, i don't want the function firing when the parent is clicked
[13:31:31] <Crumbz> oh
[13:31:32] <Crumbz> wait
[13:31:33] <Crumbz> yes
[13:31:35] <Crumbz> i see
[13:31:48] <Crumbz> :)  thank you. didn't see the '.credentialFields' :P
[13:31:50] <LocalPCGuy> Crumbs yup, it limits it to only when the class you specify is click
[13:32:08] <Crumbz> ok thanks mate. :)
[13:32:11] <LocalPCGuy> the on() page in the docs is pretty thorough
[13:32:12] <LocalPCGuy> np
[13:32:37] <Crumbz> i'm not the most patient person to read 2000 words when it can be answered in 10 seconds :P
[13:32:50] <Crumbz> thanks. :)
[13:33:00] <LocalPCGuy> ahh...but a better understanding of what is going on will save you time in the long run :)
[13:33:47] <rue> Crumbz: It’s good practice for when people stop answering your questions
[13:34:22] <gnarf> bwq: I spend a lot of time working on this thing called jQuery - and I don't charge anyone anything for it...  2k for work you've already done, or can resell easily to 10 other people for 2k each isn't terrible
[13:35:27] <Crumbz> true enough guys but sometimes 90% of  the information that comes in isn't relevant and can easily be forgotten. i like to get the basics nailed and the itterate through the things i've missed
[14:02:00] <sunbeam> i'd like to use conditional cufon when the user his browser is IE6,7,8
[14:02:03] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[14:05:24] <bwq> gnarf: can't really resell the same design 10 times :D
[14:05:39] <gnarf> bwq: i'm not a designer
[14:05:40] <bwq> i never said you shouldn't put a lot of effort into your work :p
[14:05:42] <gnarf> bwq: :)
[14:05:47] <bwq> also, you are awesome for working on jquery <3
[14:16:38] <systemfault> Why would anyone use cufon in 2012?
[14:17:02] <systemfault> Just use font-embedding… if the license of the font permits.
[14:22:27] <b0bi> how can i check if a certain string starts with "Error" or not?
[14:23:06] <LocalPCGuy> bobi stringvar.substring(0,5) === "Error"
[14:23:20] <b0bi> LocaLPCGuy: thanks!
[14:29:30] <tw2113> anyone have a resource or two on how to pull a UTC date from an input, and then convert it to a human readable format?
[14:29:46] <tw2113> I mostly need help with the date formatting more than getting from the input
[14:30:13] <tw2113> all searched results seem to deal with "right now" and not a static UTC value
[14:35:29] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113 you can pass the time string to the Date() function to create a new Date object that represents that timedate
[14:35:32] <LindsayMac> lol tw2113 i knew i would see you here..
[14:36:21] <tw2113> so var mydate = '1342828800'; var newdate = new Date(mydate); LocalPCGuy ?
[14:36:39] <tw2113> LindsayMac i still auto-join this room, i don't with #wordpress
[14:36:50] <LindsayMac> awwww why not?!
[14:37:00] <tw2113> because this place doesn't drive me mad half the time
[14:37:20] <LocalPCGuy> rw2113 it should, not working?
[14:37:58] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  dont autojoin #css then.. holy crap the idiots there!
[14:38:06] <tw2113> Date {Fri Jan 02 1970 07:18:02 GMT-0600 (CST)}
[14:38:18] <tw2113> my console.log result
[14:39:16] <LocalPCGuy> if you assign the Date function to a var, you should have the ability to run all of the standard Date functions from that like .getHours()
[14:39:23] <LocalPCGuy> and format it how you want
[14:40:48] <Tomashe> hey guys i need some advice , im trying to post using jquery , on firebug net i see the link but its with red color
[14:40:50] <Tomashe> what is that means
[14:40:50] <Tomashe> ?
[14:41:08] <Tomashe> and for somerason i dont get the databack even its an html file
[14:41:28] <Tomashe> and i get link 200 OK 35ms
[14:44:10] <Tomashe> $.post("http://www.mydomain.com/newsletter_cookie.php"
[14:44:26] <Tomashe> i post to another domain
[14:44:51] <tw2113> bah, i need to figure out why sending the UTC time var into new Date() is giving me some date in January of 1970
[14:45:30] <LocalPCGuy> january of 1970 is the "base date" when no parameters are passed
[14:45:48] <LocalPCGuy> 1/1/1970
[14:45:59] <tw2113> i'm getting the 16th
[14:46:00] <tw2113> odd
[14:47:27] <LocalPCGuy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/
[14:47:55] <tw2113> thanks
[14:53:16] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113 are you getting the difference between 2 dates and then trying to make that into a date?
[14:53:20] <LocalPCGuy> by chance?
[14:53:58] <tw2113> no, i have a UTC date stored in an input field
[14:54:06] <tw2113> well, read into it on page load
[14:54:21] <tw2113> i'm trying a "hack" of sorts to make that human readable at first
[14:54:32] <LocalPCGuy> from what server side language?
[14:54:36] <tw2113> php
[14:54:48] <tw2113> WordPress
[14:56:15] <LocalPCGuy> you need to make sure the variable you are storing the input value in is NOT a string, but is a number
[14:56:28] <tw2113> in the end, i'll be grabbing the value from the input, converting to readable, and then putting in the new version
[14:56:47] <tw2113> using firefox scratchpad to test for the moment :D
[14:56:50] <LocalPCGuy> so in your earlier example it should be:
[14:57:07] <LocalPCGuy> var mydate = 1232828800; var newdate = new Date(mydate);
[14:58:08] <tw2113> which is essentially what i have at the moment
[14:58:17] <tw2113> and then console.log(newdate), and i get 1970
[15:00:32] <tw2113> grr, i think i have bigger problems at the moment
[15:00:46] <LocalPCGuy> I think your timestamp is in seconds and JS wants milliseconds
[15:00:51] <LocalPCGuy> try * 1000
[15:00:56] <LocalPCGuy> and see if the date is correct
[15:01:11] <tw2113> i think i just realized all of the dates I'm seeing on this website are set to today
[15:01:16] <tw2113> which doesn't sound right either
[15:09:20] <kevinquinnyo> i am making a bookmarklet that manipulates elements that arent "visibile/available" until after they are hovered over with a mouse
[15:09:50] <shoky> tw2113 you probably need to multiplty it by 1000 ?
[15:09:52] <kevinquinnyo> any way for me to get around this so that these divs are available to be manipulated without me manually mousing over them?
[15:10:39] <tw2113> i put that in my js file that i saved, i'm going to return to it another day
[15:10:53] <tw2113> but i did multiple the UTC int by 1000
[15:47:26] <kevinquinnyo>  .match() is not a function
[15:47:44] <LindsayMac> I am looking for suggestions on how to optimize a page load that has multiple large background images on it.. Any thoughts? The background images are set to cover to fix the size of the screen and they are set to be backgrounds of 5 div container that fit the width and height of the monitor. The smoothscroll plugin is set to scroll to them, so they arent visible on the screen, but they need to be visible as easing i
[15:47:44] <LindsayMac> n..  thoughts?
[15:48:26] <kevinquinnyo> hmm i'm trying to use .filter and parse regex with .match, where's the docs for this, everything i've tried so far is failing
[15:50:03] <kevinquinnyo> LindsayMac: i'm not the person to ask for jquery/js, but just letting you know you're text was cut off
[15:50:25] <kevinquinnyo> not sure if that's an irc protocol limit or my client
[15:50:58] <kevinquinnyo> irc is like twitter apparently
[15:51:36] <g0z> irc limit
[15:51:56] <kevinquinnyo> LindsayMac: ask again but split it up, since i spammed it off the screen
[15:52:18] <LindsayMac> oops sorry kevinquinnyo
[15:52:36] <LindsayMac> I have a single page website where i am using smooth scrolling to slide to a container
[15:53:02] <LindsayMac> the containers are are set to the fit the height and widget of the screen and they have a background IMAGE set to cover (so it always fits the screen )
[15:53:37] <LindsayMac> I have 5 large images as backgrounds. Since they are kind of large and set to look good even on large monitors, the files themselves are rather big and I am looking for a way to optimize
[15:54:40] <LindsayMac> kevinquinnyo:  i am still newish to javascript in general.. just an FYI
[16:03:08] <kevinquinnyo> LindsayMac: yeah me too, i was just telling you the msg was cut off, it's kind of a post and wait thing here.  sorry wish i could help you
[16:03:44] <LindsayMac> kevinquinnyo:  its ok.. I am not new to IRC.. i know how it works. It's saturday afternoon..so any help is hugely appreciated.
[16:03:48] <LindsayMac> or even someone just LOOKING at it
[16:07:17] <LindsayMac> I am thinking I probably want to use some type of effect that will load them right before they are on screen.
[16:08:58] <LindsayMac> Or maybe I should make sure to load the BG images first before loading any of the content..
[16:09:27] <LindsayMac> because the biggest issue with my firstpage is that all the BG images are loading, but my effects are starting to trigger and you can't see them because there's no BG image up to give contrast to the white text
[16:18:36] <kevinquinnyo> LindsayMac: really new to js/web development in general, so i cant help much, but that is the first thing i thought too, that it's loading all the images in advance
[16:19:05] <kevinquinnyo> maybe pastebin.ca or jsfiddle the code and someone can help you
[16:20:23] <kevinquinnyo> http://jsfiddle.net
[16:22:48] <theere> i'm knew to javascript, if I put a script at footer that relies on hover, do i need to activate it with .ready(function()
[16:24:04] <LindsayMac> Alrighty.. got the jsfiddle up and working.. http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/YtedW/
[16:24:59] <LindsayMac> basically you can see a bunch of large images as backgrounds for multiple divs stacked on top of each other.. I would prefer to keep that curtain raising effect, which is why i feel that its important that if I am not going to load them all in one shot, to load it right before.. maybe onclick?
[16:43:35] <sahbeewah> why don't you want to load it all at once?
[16:44:26] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  because they are large images and I felt it might optimize the site load in general better if they are loaded before or right before they are needed
[16:45:21] <sahbeewah> you can, but that increases the user's waiting time
[16:45:32] <sahbeewah> because they'll have to wait for the background image to load whenever they click on a link
[16:45:50] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  I am ok with a short delay between sliding through tabs i think.. I dont know for sure yet. I am just looking for options
[16:48:47] <sahbeewah> well, your images are too large for that to be viable imo
[16:49:02] <sahbeewah> but you'd need to take the background image links out of your external css
[16:49:17] <sahbeewah> load it in the onclick handler
[16:49:28] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah: i said before.. the size of the images (not pixel length) will be optimized
[16:51:28] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  there is another way that I can go about this. I can wait to load any of the site content until the background images are loaded
[16:52:10] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  that would basically put all of the wait on the initial load of the page, and since its a single page style site, it wont put too much on the viewer except upfront but still keep the animations working while the viewer can see them
[16:55:17] <systemfault> o_O That's bad UX, your users don't even care about the background image, don't make them wait for it.
[16:55:48] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah: except for the fact that you can't see anything unless the BG is loaded.
[16:56:03] <LindsayMac> I suppose I could add a color to the <body> to flash before the images..
[16:56:56] <LindsayMac> The goal of the site is more for "flash" than super usability. It gives me a little wiggle room with letting the client experience the visuals of the site versus click happy get it doen type style
[17:08:16] <bwq> the scrolling doesn't feel very fluid..
[17:11:54] <LindsayMac> bwq:  I am probably going to replace my smooth scroll with a better plugin
[17:12:09] <LindsayMac> writing it did help me learn, however..
[17:12:33] <bwq> i'm sure optimizing the images will go a long way too, since they are pretty huge
[17:13:01] <systemfault> LindsayMac: One thing that could help… CSS3 Media Queries for browsers that support them
[17:13:19] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  i am going to have an entirely different theme for mobile
[17:13:48] <systemfault> LindsayMac: The idea is to not load the 2500px width image if the guy only has a 800px large window.
[17:14:20] <systemfault> LindsayMac: Your assumptions can be wrong… For example, I have a 27" Apple display and I never maximize the width...
[17:14:40] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  ok i understand what you're saying..
[17:15:12] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  but hoping that the person using a large computer isn't browsing at full width isn't something i'm comfortable with.. i COULD only load the super large one, like you said, using a media query
[17:15:20] <systemfault> LindsayMac: You could have 3 versions of the image… and only one will be loaded depending on the width of the viewport
[17:15:23] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  but I do know plenty of people who browse full width
[17:15:42] <systemfault> LindsayMac: On windows, it's common because it's how "maximize works"
[17:15:47] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  yea.. i think that might be a good idea.. it stil ldoesnt help the smooth loading for those who have computers that do load the largest image
[17:15:51] <systemfault> On OSX, it's different,
[17:15:56] <systemfault> True...
[17:16:55] <sahbeewah> i just paid attention to how you implemented that background scroller
[17:17:04] <sahbeewah> you do realise people scroll manually right?
[17:17:05] <LindsayMac> i resaved the pics so if you reload those images it should show the more quickly optimized versions
[17:17:16] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  it allows to scroll manually.
[17:17:35] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  but again.. that was really more for the learning experience. I am new to javascript in general
[17:54:41] <kevinquinnyo> can i do $(some_div).load( "/location #some_other_div.css( { 'height' : '20' } )" )
[17:54:50] <kevinquinnyo> doesnt seem to work
[17:58:24] <kevinquinnyo> i guess i meant how would i do that, that is modify css properties of a div that i call hrough .load
[17:59:03] <kevinquinnyo> s/hrough/through
[18:14:01] <amsardesai> what is .on?
[18:14:19] <amsardesai> ?.on

[18:25:31] <LindsayMac> Is there a way to add a "bounce" to the transition of addClass ?
[18:31:11] <LindsayMac> anyone with thoughts.. can i add a bounce transition to a removeClass?
[18:38:26] <gnarf> ?on
[18:38:59] <gnarf> LindsayMac: if you are using UI's addClass
[18:39:13] <gnarf> I'm not sure if it works in 1.8
[18:39:28] <gnarf> but you might be able to pass { duration: 1000, easing: "bounce" } instead of a time
[18:39:42] <gnarf> like .addClass( "test", { duration: 1000, easing: "bounce" } )
[18:39:52] <gnarf> although i think the ease is actually "easeOutBounce"
[18:40:56] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  i think in my case it would be easeIn
[18:43:00] <nessaja> Hello, could some one tell me how to display a box when someone clicks one like the searchbar
[18:48:02] <amsardesai> what do you mean?
[18:50:34] <martisj> morning
[18:52:50] <LindsayMac> anyone have an idea as to why I am getting this error:TypeError: jQuery.easing[options.animatedProperties[this.prop]] is not a function
[18:53:05] <LindsayMac> this this basic code             $('#dropit').removeClass('dropin', 5600, 'easeOutbounce' );
[18:56:51] <LindsayMac> I am thinking I need to use .animate
[18:57:29] <nessaja> amsardesai, somthing like twitter has when you searc for users if you familliar with that
[18:57:54] <nessaja> you click on a search input tag and a small new window appears below it
[18:58:36] <LindsayMac> nessaja: like an autocomplete?
[18:58:49] <theere> can anyone explain me the advantage of using .ready over having script at bottom of page?
[19:00:09] <nessaja> LindsayMac not sure how this is called but you probably right
[19:00:31] <nessaja> should i imgur the photo ?
[19:00:35] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  you want to have a little thing appear with a bunch of quesses of what you might be typing?
[19:00:38] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  YES!
[19:00:53] <nessaja> yes umm but let me show you
[19:01:16] <nessaja> one moment, because sometimes with stuff like that you have to be specific :)
[19:02:05] <scarlet_r> i want label become highlight when radio is checked.... what do i miss  -> http://jsfiddle.net/mFq2B/
[19:02:21] <LindsayMac> Ok can someone please give me some direction with how to bounce the transition of addClass / removeClass OR changing a margin height?
[19:06:21] <LindsayMac> anyone help me with a bounce effect at teh end of a removeClass or animate css
[19:08:39] <scarlet_r> can anyone give some advice on my script on fiddle ? thanks anyway...
[19:09:44] <LindsayMac> sorry
[19:10:22] <scarlet_r> yeah... sorry... i'm just a newbie too.. .heee_
[19:11:15] <nessaja> LindsayMac sorry phone call was going on at the same time, this is the cool thing that im talking about : http://imgur.com/kBg22
[19:12:49] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  yea that's a type ahead script.. you need to use a plugin or jqueryUI for that but you have to kno wthat you also have to have a database of information that you have to connect it to in order to show that stuff...
[19:13:03] <LindsayMac> nessaja: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete
[19:13:43] <nessaja> yeah i already have the datebase because im using for other things as well, so i jusT SELECT those thing to make them display there
[19:14:45] <scarlet_r> looking for some attention... :)
[19:14:55] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  you probably dont want to do a direct sql to get them into the javascript.. but instead write a funciton that you can call withint he script
[19:15:41] <LindsayMac> So can anyone tell me how to use the jqueryUI easeInOutBounce function on adding and removing a top margin?!
[19:16:11] <nessaja> LindsayMac thats true
[19:16:21] <LindsayMac> I can get the same effect using .animate or .removeClass.. but I cant get the darn bounce to work!
[19:16:22] <nessaja> and yes thats what im looking for, thank you so much
[19:16:38] <nessaja> by the way is this a lot of work ?
[19:17:03] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  writing the php.. maybe.. the javascript should just be simple plugin and using the right elements.
[19:18:09] <nessaja> yeah the php part ...lol, its like love the css part but when i gotta come back to php then im like ok lets take a deep breath lol
[19:18:28] <nessaja> i can figure it out but it takes a while lol
[19:18:43] <LindsayMac> lol im the opposite.. . well almost. I love doing css stuff.. and i LOVE php.. i hate javascript
[19:18:47] <nessaja> because usually im always missing something or want to add something
[19:18:48] <LindsayMac> but im learning to love it
[19:20:13] <nessaja> Lindsay really thats is awesome, more poeple like you gonna become sucesfull instead those who download framework and then are getting attack by span... umm wonder why
[19:20:14] <nessaja> lol
[19:20:50] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  i use frameworks.. but i try to learn as much about the languages as I can.. javascript is one of the newer ones to me..
[19:21:01] <LindsayMac> the one thing i NEVER wantt o be is a copy/paste pirte
[19:21:04] <LindsayMac> pirate*
[19:21:57] <LindsayMac> omg my computer is acting so glitchy that I cant tell if my animations are glitch or its just my computer
[19:22:15] <nessaja> LindsayMac when you making a site that you think is gonna have a lot of traffic, when it comes to server side coding, should not use it, because there are already bot created for that that just are going to spam the hell out of the site
[19:23:13] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  are you talking about should not use a sql selectFrom?
[19:24:37] <nessaja> im talking about anything involved with php
[19:24:43] <nessaja> validation  specially
[19:24:48] <nessaja> really important
[19:25:09] <LindsayMac> of course
[19:25:49] <nessaja> my friend had a framework for forum
[19:26:16] <nessaja> and he deleted it, because it was like all spam only one unique user......him
[19:26:17] <LindsayMac> nessaja:  wrote their own?
[19:26:37] <nessaja> he used zend
[19:26:45] <LindsayMac> oh you are now talking about open source frameworks.. I use them all the time.. they are GREAT, but you need to know what you are doing.
[19:27:27] <nessaja> def not copy and paste
[19:27:53] <LindsayMac> well using something like wordpress or even a php framework like cake or kahona is NOT copypaste
[19:28:13] <LindsayMac> you need to know what you are doing.. or at least you should.. but using that is bad. its silly to try and reinvent the wheel
[19:28:52] <shoky> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vNa7L/
[19:29:06] <LindsayMac> what shoky?
[19:29:26] <shoky> isn't that what you were asking about?
[19:29:27] <nessaja> nessja always concern about spam bots and stuff like that lol
[19:29:32] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ohh.. yea. i actually got it
[19:29:41] <shoky> k
[19:29:45] <LindsayMac> a little different, but it works.
[19:30:01] <LindsayMac> shoky:  but I do have another quesiton now.. is there a way to customize the bounce? Its a little too "cartoony" for me.
[19:30:14] <LindsayMac> shoky: https://gist.github.com/d0fa51a5e912ddc3ade2
[19:30:25] <shoky> you could always make your own easing function
[19:30:46] <LindsayMac> you can't tweak an existing one? I have no idea how to do that
[19:30:56] <shoky> you can copy it and use it as a base, sure
[19:31:09] <LindsayMac> where do I find one to copy/paste?
[19:32:06] <LindsayMac> maybe I want elastic instead of bounce
[19:32:23] <shoky> LindsayMac: well this is the code defining the jqueryui ones: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L1203
[19:32:47] <shoky> it's just sharing some of the functionality between different easings
[19:32:48] <LindsayMac> ok cool
[19:36:02] <LindsayMac> ok i think its time for me to hightail it out of here.
[19:49:25] <jonkersjoe> whatwg wtf...
[19:58:03] <scarlet_r> http://jsfiddle.net/mFq2B/
[19:58:14] <scarlet_r> cannot higlight label if radio click...
[19:58:18] <scarlet_r> something missing ?
[20:12:04] <jonkersjoe> scarlet_r:  are you there ?
[20:12:22] <scarlet_r> yes....  i got this page... http://html.cita.illinois.edu/nav/form/radio/index.php?example=4
[20:12:41] <scarlet_r> but i try it but it created by pure js...
[20:13:05] <scarlet_r> and not work... hehe... :)
[20:13:09] <scarlet_r> in my page...
[20:14:40] <jonkersjoe> regarding your question above, if im getting you correctly you want to highlight the label next to radio button if the radio button is selected ?
[20:15:08] <scarlet_r> radio button and its label....
[20:16:21] <jonkersjoe> lemme check it out
[20:17:26] <scarlet_r> jonkersjoe by the way thanks for your respond :)
[20:30:35] <jonkersjoe> scarlet_r: sorry for the delay is this waht you were after ? http://jsfiddle.net/prad/mFq2B/4/
[20:31:03] <SeanJM> I am using trigger on a page and each time the event is triggered, the effect is multiplied. So that on the fourth time I trigger the event, it triggers it 4 times.
[20:32:03] <scarlet_r> jonkersjoe thanks for tons...... :)
[20:32:04] <scarlet_r> sorry for bothering u.... :)
[20:32:15] <scarlet_r> once again jonkerjoe thank... :)
[20:32:55] <jonkersjoe> np
[20:33:33] <SeanJM> http://jsfiddle.net/SGtcw/2/ <-- my jsfiddle works flawlessly, I'm wondering if there is another reason why the effect would be multiplied
[20:33:38] <jonkersjoe> seanJM : can you create a testtcase ?
[20:34:01] <jonkersjoe> ok thanks
[20:34:08] <SeanJM> I'm specifically injecting some JS into oDesk
[20:42:39] <SeanJM> I figured out why
[21:24:10] <nessaja> LindsayMac
[21:46:00] <coldhead> riveting
[22:08:37] <lolwhoami> Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
[22:09:28] <lolwhoami> I was wondering if anyone here is awake enough to give me some advice.
[22:10:59] <lolwhoami> Hullo
[22:11:28] <coldhead> can you be more specific
[22:11:37] <coldhead> if you'd asked already we could be answering already
[22:11:41] <coldhead> get on with it, buddy :)
[22:11:54] <lolwhoami> ... Wait oh okay. It regards ajax and the unload event
[22:12:07] <lolwhoami> The $(document).unload thing is deprecated
[22:12:14] <lolwhoami> And so is ajax async: true
[22:12:21] <coldhead> you can't really do ajax on unload
[22:12:25] <coldhead> it hardly ever works
[22:12:32] <lolwhoami> That's what I've found.
[22:12:58] <coldhead> the browser kills all open requests pretty quick :(
[22:13:06] <lolwhoami> Oh dear...
[22:13:31] <lolwhoami> Well, I'm not looking for information returned.
[22:13:39] <lolwhoami> I want to send a signal to the server to end a session
[22:13:48] <lolwhoami> Yes, php is saving session states; I live dangerously.
[22:14:25] <lolwhoami> My end result is to make a web gui for a terminal-based application.
[22:14:51] <lolwhoami> Each user who goes onto the website gets their own little session, which ends when they leave the website or refresh it.
[22:14:52] <abjorn> coldhead: HAY HAY BROTATO
[22:15:37] <coldhead> lolwhoami: does it work if you just use async: false, deprecation aside?
[22:15:51] <coldhead> because if that works, don't let the jQuery thought police push you around
[22:15:54] <coldhead> do what you gotta do
[22:16:07] <coldhead> happy weekend, abjsy
[22:18:35] <abjorn> yep
[22:18:39] <abjorn> im celebrating the traditional way
[22:18:48] <abjorn> whiskey and bad anime
[22:21:01] <lolwhoami> The synchonous call doesn't seem to work...
[22:21:53] <coldhead> it doesn't hit the server? or it doesn't seem to even make the call?
[22:22:16] <lolwhoami> I have a gearman server going on
[22:22:20] <coldhead> you might need to use some kind of proxy like charles to see what's actually occurring >: |
[22:22:31] <lolwhoami> ?
[22:43:09] <abjorn> ohgod
[22:43:56] <abjorn> well that was interesting
[22:48:02] <coldhead> abjorn: could you dedicate a machine JUST to node.js and have it proxy data to your legacy php stuff on another machine?
[22:48:13] <coldhead> other machines*
[22:48:46] <abjorn> idk maybe
[22:48:51] <abjorn> but
[22:49:00] <abjorn> well, we'd use perl, but yeah
[22:49:17] <abjorn> Our official stance now is using Perl for APIs and PHP for the actual websites.
[22:49:30] <coldhead> hmm, i wouldn't put perl past having a websocket implementation
[22:49:30] <abjorn> Which, at least we're not using PHP for APIs.
[22:49:34] <abjorn> oh it does
[22:49:42] <abjorn> several, actually
[22:49:49] <abjorn> it's the only other platform with a decent implementation
[22:49:57] <abjorn> mojolicious has a real good one
[22:49:59] <coldhead> so... case closed?
[22:50:25] <abjorn> Probably, but we're real keen on using socket.io. There's pocket.io for perl but it's pretty beta and incomplete. But we'll see.
[22:51:02] <abjorn> But we can probably task one of the perl programmers with forking it and making it viable
[22:51:16] <coldhead> god bless those perl guys
[22:52:04] <abjorn> But the thought we have right now is that the performance won't be what we want, which is where Node.js comes in. I made a working implementation of the major part of the system we want sockets for, working on tests for it, then gonna port to a perl-backed version so we can compare the two. We already know Node.js will win that bout, but it's mostly to show management.
[22:52:31] <coldhead> man good luck with that
[22:52:34] <coldhead> sounds fun
[22:52:41] <abjorn> Well, management has, uh...changed, recently.
[22:53:07] <abjorn> We just got bought out, company called EIG (not the one you might be thinking of), who also owns bluehost and a bunch of other companies.
[22:53:53] <abjorn> The people making the decisions on this kind of stuff are the same (CTO and Deputy CTO), but now the CEO has more authority to put pressure on them to let us do what we need to.
[22:54:04] <abjorn> IT IS AN INTERESTING TIME FOR THE COMPANY
[22:55:02] <abjorn> I have mixed feelings, though, if we use Node.js I might have to teach a lot of my coworkers how to not suck at JavaScript :(
[22:55:17] <abjorn> Cause officially backend ain't my place
[22:55:34] <abjorn> anyways, coldhead, HOWS SHIT GOIN FOR YOU
[22:55:59] <coldhead> very lame, working sunday to meet a deadline on a project which sucks and will fail with or without my help
[22:56:08] <coldhead> please kill me etc
[22:56:23] <coldhead> teaching people not to suck at JS is fun
[22:56:38] <coldhead> AND the more people who know JS the less time #jQuery wastes on dumb questions
[22:56:45] <coldhead> it's for the greater good!
[22:57:07] <abjorn> so, you do freelance stuff, right?
[23:09:05] <coldhead> god no, abjorn, i don't have that kind of initiative
[23:09:22] <coldhead> i just find someone that will hire me and hang on with clenched teeth until i can't endure it any longer
[23:09:41] <abjorn> lo.
[23:09:42] <abjorn> lol
[23:09:46] <abjorn> yeah i couldn't do freelance
[23:10:03] <tw2113> coldhead needs money?
[23:10:10] <abjorn> too much saturation in austin, there's so many freelancers and consulting firms that its hard to get a good gig as a freelancer
[23:10:15] <abjorn> unless youre already established
[23:10:19] <coldhead> one must pay for rent and food, tw2113
[23:10:30] <tw2113> there's more ways to pay than with money
[23:10:39] <tw2113> coldhead: male gigalo
[23:10:43] <abjorn> well not everyone gives head for rent
[23:11:00] <abjorn> I, for one, do not enjoy the taste of a cock in my mouth
[23:11:08] <tw2113> what if the landlord is female?
[23:11:28] <abjorn> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[23:11:30] <abjorn> depends
[23:11:35] <abjorn> my landlord is female but
[23:11:35] <tw2113> or if male, have a daughter that's kind of ugly
[23:11:36] <abjorn> i would not
[23:11:51] <tw2113> see, many variables
[23:12:27] <coldhead> it depends on the diet too
[23:12:29] <coldhead> and the time of year
[23:12:34] <coldhead> soap preferences
[23:12:44] <coldhead> electronic funds transfers are just easier
[23:13:02] <coldhead> i am SO ready for retirement
[23:13:06] <coldhead> except in the financial sense
[23:32:07] <abjorn> coldhead i am drunk save me
[23:32:13] <abjorn> actually dont i like this
[23:33:17] <coldhead> try spinning around wildly and bellowing
[23:33:46] <abjorn> im gonnna
[23:33:47] <abjorn> go ahead
[23:33:48] <abjorn> and not do taht
[23:39:50] <tw2113> *kicks dirt*
[23:40:00] <tw2113> i would have paid $1 to see that
[23:50:14] <abjorn> tw2113: make it $2 and consider it done
[23:51:07] <tw2113> what am I? Scrooge McDuck?
[23:54:34] <abjorn> idk maybe
[23:54:48] <abjorn> wow its gettinr pretty hard to code irhgtn ow
[23:56:02] <tw2113> and you're gone for the night
[23:56:55] <abjorn> nuh uh
[23:56:55] <abjorn> well
[23:56:57] <abjorn> proably
[23:57:12] <tw2113> lack of spelling is always my tipping point when drinking
[23:57:22] <abjorn> hahah thats just the begining
[23:57:31] <abjorn> brb getting more
