[03:26:35] <Dro> Hello
[03:26:46] <Dro> how can I get the scroll position of a tr inside a table?
[03:43:06] <Cork> Dro: a table doesn't have scrolls
[03:43:21] <Cork> you can get the element offset to the scroll parent
[05:49:05] <interop_madness> Hello, i have a problem concerning width calculation of existing, visible DOM elements upon the first run after the browser has been started. Relevant code portion including explanation: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/73a135e4f4cae6114d82111b03c93f55
[05:50:20] <interop_madness> the calculated width seems (at least, that's my suspicion) to be wrong the first time after browser start due to dynamic loading of a CSS file relevant to the rendering. if that is the case, i'd need some idea how to "wait" for the CSS's styles being actually applied
[05:50:35] <interop_madness> if you suspect another reason for this behavior, please say so
[06:13:17] <thykka> interop_madness, did you already try wrapping it in a DOMContentLoaded or load event?
[06:13:45] <thykka> Or if require.js delays the load, does it provide events for when the delayed loads have completed?
[06:14:44] <interop_madness> thykka, this is inside a dynamic dialog that opens upon click on a menu button. every CSS and every code relevant up to that point (before button click opening the dialog) is properly inside .load() events
[06:15:29] <interop_madness> thykka, the dialog code itself fetches the CSS with require.js and there is a callback for the mere file fetching, but that does not take into account the additional time/delay the browser might take to actually apply the styles therein to the DOM
[06:16:01] <interop_madness> the callback's semantics basically is "CSS file has now been fetched from server"
[06:16:21] <thykka> ..but not inserted into DOM yet?
[06:17:04] <thykka> http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#multiversion
[06:17:57] <interop_madness> thykka, not sure, but guess as far as mere physical insertion of <link rel="stylesheet" .../> into <header> is concerned, i'd guess that the callback won't be called before that, yes
[06:18:48] <interop_madness> but my suspicion is that between adding a stylesheet to <head> and the stylesheet's styles actually being applied by the rendering engine, an additional delay exists which is my problem
[06:44:25] <thykka> interop_madness, 'load' events generally fire when the element in question is actually ready, and not just downloaded
[06:46:17] <thykka> interop_madness, for instance, it's common to use the 'load' event of an <img> to detect the image's intrinsic width/height
[06:47:19] <thykka> interop_madness, but if you're using require.js anyway, why not simply make your width-detection script as a module which requires the other CSS stuff?
[07:06:17] <Cork> interop_madness: modifying stylesheets is very costly and very unstable; why do you feel you need to do that at all?
[07:26:57] <Hyponic> Hello. I have a form that have some input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. What i want is for the some of the elements to appear or disapear depending on what choices that user makes. A logical form builder in a way. Is there any place you can recommend for me to look at or some open source code i can look at ? any help would be appriciated.
[07:31:58] <FilipNortic> Hyponic: just hide and disable / show and remove disabled in a function and call that from your event handlers
[08:01:18] <Cork> Hyponic: there are a ton of ways to construct that, you could have a handler on the form reacting on change events and checking for classes or long javascript function or...
[08:01:34] <Cork> Hyponic: what fits best depends on what you have to work with
[08:11:20] <hellyeah> anyone knows about geojs here?
[08:44:42] <Dro> Inside 'this' element I have a , how can I disable it?
[08:44:56] <Dro> $(this 'a'). ?
[08:47:18] <CuAnnan> a links aren't really enabled disabled
[08:47:24] <CuAnnan> You can remove the href attribute
[08:47:32] <CuAnnan> Or prevent default on the click handle
[08:47:42] <CuAnnan> But that would require you to track whether or not it's done.
[08:47:53] <CuAnnan> And unset it when you want to re-enable it
[08:49:32] <CuAnnan> Is there a simple way of figuring out why a switchClass callback function is happening immediately instead of when the animation is complete?
[08:49:59] <CuAnnan> $.ui.version is 1.12.0
[08:55:04] <hellyeah> attr('disabled',true)
[08:55:10] <FilipNortic> no
[08:55:34] <FilipNortic> links can't be disabled like stated above
[08:55:49] <FilipNortic> and when setting disabled use prop not attr
[08:56:39] <FilipNortic> *as stated above...
[08:56:41] <user_corrupt> I'm trying to POST and AJAX request to server, with an object as data... if I don't specify contentType, then I get a server error 500, and can see the object in chrome debugger network tab... If I specify contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', then I get a 405 method not allowed error, and don't even see the object in the network tab.. the same exact object is being posted to the same endpoint using postman... does anyone have any
[08:56:41] <user_corrupt> idea as to what might be going on?
[08:58:03] <FilipNortic> whar does the backend expect?
[08:58:04] <FilipNortic> what*
[08:58:43] <CuAnnan> There is nothing quite so frustrating as not being able to replicate a bug in a jsfiddle
[08:59:31] <CuAnnan> Does anyone happen to know if jquery ui and bootstrap 4 don't play well together?
[09:00:22] <FilipNortic> Id say jQuery ui creates trubble with alot of things these days
[09:00:32] <FilipNortic> user_corrupt: The HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed response status code indicates that the request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used.
[09:00:44] <FilipNortic> so if you'd set the server to expect a get method
[09:01:08] <FilipNortic> or some a param is required or something like that. it could make sense
[09:09:20] <user_corrupt> FilipNortic: postman uses POST on this endpoint successfully.. one thing I notice is that when I don't specify contentType then application/xml is what is shown in response header by default.. the object is also there in that case, but not when I specify JSON as contentType.. maybe I need to JSON stringify the object before I attempt to post it?
[09:11:01] <FilipNortic> user_corrupt: either that or tell the backend to expect a json object with the with the attributes that you send
[09:12:04] <FilipNortic> js lacks types so the backend must convert a json object to an object with suitable types for that language
[09:12:29] <FilipNortic> how to do that is framework spesific
[09:14:43] <Cork> user_corrupt: how are you ajax posting the object?
[09:15:41] <Cork> cause if you send json from the client you need to first encode the object as json, and then you need to set the contentType key in the request to "application/json"
[09:15:54] <Cork> and don't mix that up with the response header
[09:17:32] <fn> Cork: do you speak reactjs? or only jquery?
[09:17:52] <Cork> you mean in this case or in general?
[09:18:04] <fn> general
[09:18:29] <Cork> i've used react a bit but not by far as much native js and jquery
[09:18:35] <Cork> never seen the appeal of it
[09:19:43] <user_corrupt> Cork: I'm trying to JSON.stringify the object first, and am trying to set contentType to "application/json" but request header is now showing nothing at all for contentType, not showing the object, and I'm getting a 405 error
[09:20:15] <Cork> user_corrupt: and you're sure the server supports json body requests?
[09:20:40] <Cork> (quite commonly servers use params queries and json responses)
[09:20:46] <user_corrupt> Cork: postman is doing Content-Type →application/json; charset=utf-8  successfully
[09:21:22] <Cork> do you have raw body of the two requests you could show?
[09:23:14] <user_corrupt> this is latest from localhost with object JSON.stringified and contentType set to application/json: https://gist.github.com/pivcec/f519033aac190608afef1f5a8d321d29
[09:23:44] <Cork> so no body?
[09:24:20] <Cork> also that is the options call
[09:24:22] <Cork> not the post
[09:24:31] <Cork> your most likely doing cross domain
[09:24:43] <Cork> and then the browser does an OPTIONS call before posting
[09:24:58] <Cork> if the server doesn't respond with a CORS header allowing the post it will refuse
[09:25:35] <Cork> (the browser will refuse that is)
[09:27:55] <user_corrupt> Cork: I see... request header looks like this when I don't specify content type: https://gist.github.com/pivcec/bcfb634a8d59ea5bed314a385a41802d
[09:28:12] <user_corrupt> object is shown in Form Data, in that case
[09:28:20] <user_corrupt> and I get a 500
[09:29:12] <Cork> but weird...
[09:29:29] <Cork> do you have anything set up on the server to handle OPTIONS?
[09:29:31] <user_corrupt> is it cross domain just because the server is on another domain?
[09:29:49] <user_corrupt> I feel like I'm asking a real dumb question now
[09:29:55] <Cork> if the protocol, domain OR PORT differs it is cors
[09:30:09] <Cork> so http://localhost => https://localhost is cors
[09:30:26] <Cork> or http://localhost:80 => http://localhost:8080
[09:30:33] <TViernion> anyone here use or can recomend a good remote irc shell client... and it's probably the wrong name.  What i'm looking for is a client i can install on my server that connects to irc then i can connect to it so it never goes offline.
[09:30:44] <user_corrupt> ok.. I'll have to ask backend guy if OPTIONS are set up
[09:30:51] <Cork> TViernion: => #znc
[09:30:59] <TViernion> That's the one i used to use!
[09:31:02] <TViernion> thank you cork@!
[09:31:38] <TViernion> irc bouncer is what i was looking for
[09:32:50] <Cork> user_corrupt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS
[09:32:53] <thykka> TViernion, I use WeeChat.. It's not a bouncer, but aside from running it within a detachable screen/tmux session, there's also a relay mode which allows for touch UI clients on smartphones, etc
[09:33:00] <Cork> user_corrupt: and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS is good reads
[09:33:59] <user_corrupt> Cork: I'm reading that JSON P is my only other option aside from having server handle OPTIONS
[09:34:10] <user_corrupt> gonna try now..
[09:34:26] <Cork> user_corrupt: except you can't post data with jsonp
[09:34:37] <Cork> user_corrupt: jsonp is for fetching data, and it only supports get calls
[09:34:46] <user_corrupt> oh, bummer
[09:38:01] <Cork> user_corrupt: so ya, you have two options have the data as url params or enable cors
[09:38:25] <Cork> (though you should never modify server state with a get request, it isn't proxy safe)
[09:39:51] <Cork> user_corrupt: to be specific jsonp is using the fact that browsers allow <script src=""></script> to access any domain on the net
[09:40:32] <Cork> user_corrupt: so they load a script from the server in a script tag and have it call a local function with the javascript object as arguments to the function call
[09:40:51] <Cork> (and yes jsonp is a big ugly hack)
[09:41:11] <user_corrupt> sounds gross
[09:42:31] <Cork> it is
[11:20:52] <dimi1947> I am trying to use the filter() method and in it contains all the input boxes thar are empty...how I will do it?
[11:23:57] <dimi1947> the input boxes have class .services
[11:34:26] <shoky_> dimi1947: pass a function to .filter() and use .val() inside it to check each box. (assuming you mean <input>s)
[12:37:06] <codecutter> Trying to set the offset prop. error on line 16 (see console) https://jsfiddle.net/ojb8pwrz/ (popper doc https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#defaults)
[12:43:45] <codecutter> anyone suggestions?
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> popper: {top = 100;} codecutter
[12:52:16] <robertmaxrees> that's got two errors on it :)
[12:52:58] <codecutter> top: 100 ?
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, an no semicolon
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> you're also missing a closing paren
[12:53:20] <robertmaxrees> for var popup = new Popper(reference, popper, {
[12:53:55] <codecutter> see update https://jsfiddle.net/ojb8pwrz/1/
[12:54:12] <robertmaxrees> no more errors :)
[12:54:49] <codecutter> erm
[12:55:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:55:09] <codecutter> you're right
[12:55:16] <codecutter> my console did not update properly :)
[12:57:01] <codecutter> how do i use the offset props to push the popup box right to the top of the doc? https://jsfiddle.net/ojb8pwrz/2/
[12:57:54] <codecutter> you cab use the offset props to position the popup, right?
[12:57:56] <codecutter> can*
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> you could, but something tells me it's going to be a pain to do what you want with that.
[13:01:58] <codecutter> In my actual script, the popper seems to be positioning the popup way above the the parent element, i'm trying to move it down a little bit.
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> so wait - where do you want the popup to show?
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> codecutter.
[13:05:27] <codecutter> to the top, then i can just edit it to my liking
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> do you want it in the top right of the window, or the top right of the element the mouse is on?
[13:06:12] <codecutter> anywhere, just as long as its moved from its default position
[13:06:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:06:23] <codecutter> top
[13:06:35] <robertmaxrees> relative to...?
[13:06:39] <codecutter> link
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> okay, so above the element you're hovering on?
[13:07:01] <codecutter> yes
[13:07:13] <codecutter> al the way to the top
[13:07:24] <codecutter> all*
[13:07:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:07:47] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing me here.
[13:07:52] <codecutter> sorry
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> "all the way to the top" implies you mean you want it positioned at the top of the window itself.
[13:08:15] <codecutter> viewport
[13:08:29] <codecutter> just in visible area
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> that's fundamentally different from what you were saying a second ago.  i wouldn't use offset for that.
[13:08:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd use data.styles to set position: fixed; and go from there.

[13:09:05] <Neo1> Hi
[13:10:17] <Neo1> I am thinking put on my blog code that will off addblock, Who know how to do it? I think it'll increase to earn money from ads ?
[13:10:39] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 "that will off addblock"?  care to clarify?
[13:10:51] <Neo1> addblock yes
[13:11:06] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I nothing got form google adsence 0
[13:11:14] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 do you mean you want to turn off adblock for people visiting your site?
[13:11:19] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: and I have got 100 visitors per/day
[13:11:35] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I want
[13:11:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not really something you can do, i'm afraid.
[13:12:05] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: just 100 visitors per day and 0 in google, I think they all use addblock
[13:12:47] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 That also depends on the kinds of ads.
[13:12:56] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: why? Do you know how that work? That pop-up that's saying people off it?
[13:13:03] <codecutter> style has no effect https://jsfiddle.net/ojb8pwrz/4/
[13:13:12] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 they could be cost-per-click, cost per view, etc.
[13:13:50] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I have site bout computer thematics and sure there people are going with addblick, that why I'm getting zero
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 100 visitors per day also isn't a huge amount.
[13:14:24] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes,I understand I deliberately put ads to menu for people click on it, but with addblock they don't see it
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 right.  nor should they.
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 and it's not your place to turn adblock off for them :)
[13:15:34] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: if 50 of them click ads I think it will not bad
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 it still won't be very much.  but that's a pretty insane clickthrough rate.
[13:15:53] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: do you know how to do it? It's shoudl use javascript?
[13:15:59] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you can't.
[13:16:09] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you can't modify browswer plugins like that.
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> codecutter not sure duder.  though something tells me appending the popover to the <a> tag is gonna cause some issues for you.
[13:16:41] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: and how other sites determine this? I think there maybe installed timer that is determine if put code ads to DOM or not?
[13:16:49] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 huh?
[13:16:52] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: should maybe check DOM?
[13:17:01] <codecutter> let me change it to div
[13:17:24] <robertmaxrees> codecutter i'd read the docs for that plugin and check to see what's available.
[13:17:29] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 what would checking the dom do?
[13:17:37] <codecutter> ok, thx
[13:18:29] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: ??? See we bind timer to finction that will fire after 5 seconds when all ads must loaded, and if we haven't seen ads we'll put up blocking window?
[13:18:56] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 then your userbase will go down.
[13:18:59] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I mean check ads in document? How google ads place in my site?
[13:19:00] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 and that'll kill seo.
[13:19:21] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what the user base? Why?
[13:19:24] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 everything you want to do is hostile to users and will make your site less attractive to end users.
[13:19:53] <robertmaxrees> make sure you insalled the ads correctly and work on getting traffic.
[13:20:08] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see my site http://kselax.ru , Do you think something can do it still less attractive? :|?
[13:20:46] <robertmaxrees> where are the ads?
[13:20:51] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I need money, on google I've got 80$ and can't get it, until there is 100
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 >.> then keep waiting and work on getting traffic.
[13:21:19] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I removed all adds because get 0 profit
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 wtf. you just said you've gotten 80 so far...
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> if you want to make money off ads, you need to build traffic and wait.
[13:21:59] <robertmaxrees> it's not an overnight thing.
[13:22:19] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: really? But I see many people sell uncoming links even with young sites, and my site is 4 years and I nothing earn on it...:(
[13:22:34] <robertmaxrees> "sell uncoming links"?
[13:22:36] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: it's form my channel of youtube
[13:23:00] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 80 from youtube channel, site brought nothing :)
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> how long did you have the ads on your site?
[13:23:27] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: bad thematics, all my visitors with addverb
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> soooo... how long did you have the ads on your site?
[13:24:44] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: adds had been during 3 years maybe. This summer I put off it
[13:25:24] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: earlier I had 30 - 40 visitors per day, now more in 3 time 100 and sometimes 120
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> dude
[13:25:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:25:39] <Neo1> and I should earn in 3 times more I think
[13:25:48] <robertmaxrees> 100 visitors a day is not very much.
[13:25:55] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: more visitors it's more money
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:35] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see in month I've got 3200 http://hotlog.ru/viewstat?id=2282384
[13:26:58] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i can't read russian so I don't know what any of that says.
[13:27:00] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: imagine 1500 clicks, it's not bad money 1500 * 0.02$
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming that almost 50% of users will click ads.
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> the average clickthrough rate on the internet at large is like 2%
[13:28:59] <Neo1> if turn off addblock yes, I sure, I'm going to put adds inside text and users will occasionally click on it
[13:29:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:29:22] <robertmaxrees> you're operating on faulty logic, but alright.
[13:29:32] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I make put up window and will be force user to click
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a good way to get banned.
[13:29:46] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, but what to do ?
[13:30:05] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I won't do it, it's for red word
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> don't ever block the page and force the user to click on things.  especially ads.
[13:30:46] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see how do you think working that pop up script?
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[13:31:51] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I see this and this is work for me, When on site is placed the needed information users will off addblock for get it as I did
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:33:50] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: don't understand, but by the way passed it ))) We are deviated from topic of channel :)
[13:34:06] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:34:10] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:34:36] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: no you can say how to do it using jquery, It will on them
[13:34:56] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're asking for.
[13:35:25] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: about working algorithm. I think should however check DOM after document have loaded
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> I'
[13:35:48] <robertmaxrees> *i'm not going to help you get yourself banned from using banners.
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> good luck though!
[13:35:57] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I'm asking about script that will fire pop-up if addblock if off
[13:36:17] <Neo1> ok, I'll seek in google
[13:36:49] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: do you know this http://sape.ru ?
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 nope.  services like that are generally bad ideas.
[13:38:53] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, you can get filter and low rank, but I've bought recent VPS for 10$ and want return money )))
[13:39:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:39:26] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: not bad idea, my site is hopeless I think
[13:39:54] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:41:18] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: before when search engines didn't have so strict requirements as now, that service of selling links was very popular, people were putting there many generated sites and getting big money, now not so popular
[13:42:06] <Neo1> 100 sites, 300 sites, There and this days people working http://topsape.ru/
[13:42:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm well aware of how those services work and the history behind them.
[13:43:34] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: you are from south Europe? And you know what is yandex?
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:44:32] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: ok, understood, but it's made for increase ranking in russian search engine as yandex.ru
[13:46:48] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: there important 'ТИЦ' it depends on incoming links on your site, Than more links than your site has high ТИЦ and high in search.
[13:47:03] <Neo1> I'm going put my site there and sell links
[14:23:20] <anna`> Hi folks, kind of a noob. I am making a PHP app which submits various forms and which to AJAX-ify it with Jquery2, would you recommend using serialize or JSON?
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> Jquery2?
[14:24:21] <anna`> 2.x yer
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean jQuery 2.x
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> gotchja
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> *gotcha
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> that depend son your backend honestly.
[14:24:55] <robertmaxrees> whichever suits your needs.
[14:25:00] <bayleaf> anna`: likely easist to just send the data in json through a $.POST and json_decode() it with your php response
[14:25:07] <taplar> and how closely you want to follow the REST practice
[14:25:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:25:32] <catbadger> hi
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> lots of bits and pieces in there.
[14:27:13] <anna`> Okay thanks
[14:27:55] <anna`> I am a bit of a noob as I say, and am thus wary of googling tutorials and blindly following them, can anyone recommend a tut showing a trivial implementation or a website that's well regarded?
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:28:24] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com
[14:28:26] <robertmaxrees> try.jquery.com
[14:28:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:28:58] <catbadger> anna` why not receate a UI from another project?
[14:29:29] <anna`> xD i only just read your name properly catbadger
[14:29:39] <catbadger> :)
[14:29:44] <anna`> i dunno tbh
[14:30:02] <taplar> random google: http://www.restapitutorial.com/index.html
[14:30:23] <catbadger> that's how i pick up new frameworks. I pick a target and copy it, or build somethign from sketches.
[14:32:54] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jquery isn't really a "Framework".
[14:33:25] <catbadger> true, I picked up jquery via the professional sink or swim methodology ;)
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:33:49] <robertmaxrees> more just pointing out that it's not really suited for building out an entire UI or something.
[14:34:06] <catbadger> you are (as usual) correct sir.,
[14:34:10] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:37:11] <anna`> Thanks for your help everyone :)
[14:38:50] <buzzluigiyear> Anyone know of any libraries that allow you to rotate a base64 image without using canvas? It takes absolutely forever to rotate a large image using canvas.
[14:47:17] <catbadger> buzzluigiyear - what backend are you using? maybe you want to rotate it in your backend using gd or imagick?
[14:49:08] <robertmaxrees> do you actually need to change the image or do you just want to display it that way?
[14:50:30] <catbadger> ooh! good question!
[14:53:35] <catbadger> oh it's on in #javascript!@
[14:53:38] <catbadger> lol
[15:11:40] <jak2020> hi all
[15:11:47] <jak2020> grapheti are you there? alive?
[15:12:03] <grapheti> I'm never alive.
[15:12:33] <grapheti> Only a sith deals in absolutes.
[15:12:47] <CuAnnan> Should you use .prop or .attr to get the style attribute of a node?
[15:13:15] <grapheti> Use whatever gets you the style attribute.
[15:14:13] <CuAnnan> I see there's a troll in the room
[15:14:26] <grapheti> No, I'm telling you to try it for yourself.
[15:15:05] <CuAnnan> Which is what makes you a troll.
[15:15:10] <CuAnnan> BOth will get you the attribute
[15:15:21] <grapheti> You make a lot of sense.
[15:15:23] <CuAnnan> But prop is used in specific circumstances and comes with both overhead
[15:15:28] <CuAnnan> And extra functionality.
[15:15:36] <CuAnnan> So I was asking which you *should* use
[15:15:40] <CuAnnan> Your answer was stupid
[15:15:48] <CuAnnan> And therefore I assumed troll
[15:15:53] <CuAnnan> Which is reasonabler
[15:15:58] <grapheti> Assume away.

[15:16:36] <grapheti> another one spoonfeed
[15:16:42] <taplar> they return different things
[15:16:47] <grapheti> taplar++
[15:17:43] <taplar> depending on what you want, you could use attr, or prop, or css
[15:17:52] <taplar> it's all relative to your need
[15:18:01] <grapheti> How you been taplar? :D
[15:18:07] <CuAnnan> css isn't useful to my particular usecase, since I'm trying to figure out the style properties that have not been applied by a class
[15:18:23] <taplar> taking a stupid owasp training course right now, so not so good
[15:18:30] <grapheti> LMAO
[15:18:41] <grapheti> sux2bu

[16:40:33] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:40:36] <jak2020> $(this).parent().next().find('input').val('saaa');   <--- would do the word....

[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused.
[16:46:36] <jak2020> yes used replaceall and would be repalce
[16:46:46] <robertmaxrees> try formatting your question like this: "I have this code: [link to fiddle].  I want it to do [x] when I do [y], but instead it's doing [z]."
[16:48:01] <jak2020> ok, graingert, robertmaxrees done the work: https://jsfiddle.net/z4xbf104/6/
[16:48:23] <jak2020> if you type 3 in the 1000 the second input multiply 3*1000 and so on,, thanks
[16:48:48] <robertmaxrees> i am so confused hahahahahahhaa
[16:49:11] <jak2020> ok
[16:49:35] <jak2020> i explain:
[16:50:08] <jak2020> i have this input right: <input class="form-control alignRight clEfectivo" name="x1000" id="x1000" data-valor='1000' size="10" placeholder="1000" value='0' required>    here when user type a 3, this 3 multiplied by: data-valor  (in this case) 1000
[16:51:03] <jak2020> and the result put on the next input: <input class="form-control alignRight" name="xy1000" id="xy1000" size="10" value='0' readonly>
[17:53:38] <jak2020> https://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples   <--- how to add this on a fiddle?
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> the library?
[17:54:31] <robertmaxrees> use something like http://rawgit.com/
[17:54:53] <robertmaxrees> jak2020 find the file in github https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.min.js
[17:54:56] <robertmaxrees> then use taht page/tool.

[18:05:52] <udn> hi guys
[18:06:05] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon
[18:06:10] <udn> i want add a data(attr) in squarespace
[18:06:13] <udn> but code did not work
[18:06:18] <udn> any suggestion?
[18:06:34] <duch_kazatel> show us what you tried in a jsfiddle.
[18:07:07] <udn> it is like internal jquery scripts block my code
[18:07:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:07:37] <duch_kazatel> hard to help when we don't know what code you tried :)
[18:10:05] <udn>     $('#video .sqs-block-button-container--center a').attr('lity');
[18:10:17] <duch_kazatel> that's not a data attribute hewh
[18:17:06] <udn> how can i add it to html
[18:17:10] <udn> i was tried with attr
[18:17:13] <udn> but not works
[18:17:27] <udn> but did work
[18:17:34] <udn> but did not work
[18:20:06] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[18:20:15] <duch_kazatel> are you using .da3ta()
[18:20:18] <duch_kazatel> *.data()
[18:20:25] <duch_kazatel> because that doesn't add it to the HTML./
[18:21:08] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t76u5ebo/
[18:21:17] <duch_kazatel> the value is there.  it's just not in the html./
[18:22:24] <udn> the problem is the plugin
[18:22:33] <udn> it uses data-lity
[18:22:39] <udn> that do not exist
[18:22:54] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t76u5ebo/2/
[18:22:54] <udn> https://sorgalla.com/lity/
[18:23:00] <udn> fuck plugin
[18:23:06] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[18:23:14] <udn> i was modified the jquery plugin and rename the all data.lity
[18:23:22] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:23:28] <duch_kazatel> don't modify the plugin itself duder.
[18:23:29] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea.
[18:23:30] <udn> to existent square space data-inicializated
[18:23:54] <udn> yes i dont think in update it
[18:24:02] <udn> very unflexible squarespace
[18:24:25] <udn> some other good option to squarespace?
[18:24:48] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[18:24:57] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're getting stuck on using one plugin.
[18:25:03] <duch_kazatel> no reason to throw out your entire site.
[18:25:37] <udn> i think
[18:25:43] <udn> may be some squarespace script prevent
[18:25:53] <udn> that i can add more data attributes
[18:25:58] <duch_kazatel> back waaaaaay up.
[18:26:00] <udn> it is a piece of shit
[18:26:49] <udn> sorry guys , i am loosing my patient
[18:26:49] <duch_kazatel> start from the beginning: "i have this code [link to fiddle].  I'm expecting it to do [x], but instead it's doing [y]."
[18:27:00] <udn> i do not use inapropiate language again
[18:28:05] <fas3r> hello
[18:28:39] <jak2020> i am play with this: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples  see my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/g5g1zn8t/1/     1) question: why not display the buttons same as the examples, 2) how to hidde the button Edit and/or delete onlly for the 2nd row? thanks
[18:29:18] <fas3r> is it possible to see is a click was triggered from a real click vs .trigger('click') ?
[18:30:54] <duch_kazatel> jak2020 1) looks like you're missing the icons stylesheet maybe?
[18:31:09] <duch_kazatel> 2) why is the "second row" significant?
[18:31:23] <duch_kazatel> fas3r https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692031/check-if-event-is-triggered-by-a-human
[18:32:52] <jak2020> duch_kazatel in a production code... i want hide these buttons, by sample if date of the record is old (1 month old).....
[18:33:38] <duch_kazatel> jak2020 so really, you want to hide buttons for rows of a certain age?
[18:33:45] <jak2020> yess
[18:33:48] <jak2020> yes
[18:34:08] <duch_kazatel> that's not a job for your frontend
[18:34:17] <jak2020> or any criteria, in this case hidde buttons of 2nd row or 3rd... no problem
[18:34:20] <duch_kazatel> your server should be adding a class to that particualr row.
[18:34:28] <duch_kazatel> anmd then use css for that.
[18:34:50] <jak2020> yes i know, but the buttons is of the plugin: https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.min.js
[18:35:03] <duch_kazatel> jak2020 doesn't matter.
[18:35:10] <duch_kazatel> yoru server should set a class on the tr.
[18:35:17] <duch_kazatel> and then you target through that to hide the given TD.
[18:36:02] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g5g1zn8t/3/
[18:37:53] <jak2020> duch_kazatel thanks
[18:38:17] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[18:38:28] <jak2020> yes
[18:38:34] <jak2020> understand
[18:38:35] <duch_kazatel> rad
[18:38:44] <jak2020> now check the buttons
[18:38:45] <jak2020> thanks
[18:42:12] <jak2020> <duch_kazatel> jak2020 1) looks like you're missing the icons stylesheet maybe? <-- how to add?
