[00:00:18] <Whirl3d> in your js, line 133, where you assign the hover handler...remove it completely (comment it out)
[00:01:03] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: This line: jQuery('.buttonMenu').hover(function(){ ?
[00:01:14] <fRAiLtY-> Only because my line numbers aren't the same as yours
[00:01:19] <fRAiLtY-> as it's Magento it's all over the show
[00:01:21] <Whirl3d> and add $(".buttonMenu").on("mouseenter", function (e) { $(".hoverMenu").fadeIn().on("mouseleave.custom", function (e) {$(this).off("mouseleave.custom").fadeOut();})});
[00:01:41] <Whirl3d> yes
[00:01:44] <Whirl3d> that's the line.
[00:01:55] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: Does that replace ALL my js?
[00:02:10] <Whirl3d> no, just the hover handler.
[00:03:35] <Whirl3d> you just want to open the menu when you mouseenter the button and then listen for the mouseleave event on the MENU, not the button (as would be the case with hover). when the mouse leaves the MENU, then unbind the "mouseleave" handler and hide the menu
[00:04:23] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: So it looks like this? http://pastie.org/3809003
[00:05:03] <Whirl3d> close.
[00:05:19] <Whirl3d> remove the lines 789
[00:05:58] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/3809003 ?
[00:07:25] <Whirl3d> maybe like this: http://pastie.org/3809015
[00:08:30] <Whirl3d> now I've never used .off before...so I am kinda guessing that binding mouseleave.custom with on allows us to easily unbind it with .off...
[00:08:53] <fRAiLtY-> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on' jQuery(".hoverMenu").addClass("hover").fadeIn().on("mouseleave.custom", function (e) {
[00:09:02] <fRAiLtY-> At least Chrome JS console picks something up for a change
[00:09:05] <fRAiLtY-> menu works, just no fade
[00:09:13] <Whirl3d> one second
[00:10:52] <Whirl3d> http://pastie.org/3809015
[00:10:56] <Whirl3d> maybe?
[00:11:47] <Whirl3d> you may need to add some time to the fadeIn and out... like fadeIn(500) or something
[00:14:11] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: Same problem Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[00:14:20] <fRAiLtY-> I am using jQuery 1.5.2 though‚Ä¶ ?
[00:14:22] <fRAiLtY-> Could that be it?
[00:14:33] <Whirl3d> lol
[00:14:36] <Whirl3d> gimme one second
[00:14:37] <Cork> yes
[00:14:43] <Cork> on is 1.7
[00:14:49] <Cork> or 1.6 not sure
[00:15:13] <fRAiLtY-> balls
[00:15:18] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a 1.5.2 workaround?
[00:15:20] <Christer> Anyone got the slightest idea of why i cant call a .click event on a <a> tag with the class <a class="Choose_user" href="#" >Click me </a> when its inserted with jquery?
[00:15:22] <Cork> use delegate or bind
[00:15:33] <Whirl3d> http://pastie.org/3809015
[00:15:37] <Whirl3d> that uses bind
[00:15:45] <Cork> delegate is the same as the on with a selector
[00:15:50] <Cork> bind is on without a selector
[00:16:17] <Whirl3d> and it's not ideal because it handles the mouseleave event whenever the mouse leaves the hover menu (whether its visible or not)...
[00:16:40] <samzhao_> Cork: is .live('click', function()); the same as on('click', function()); in the newest version of jquery then?
[00:16:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: as long as the menu is display: none; that doesn't matter
[00:17:00] <Whirl3d> Oh yeah!
[00:17:03] <Cork> samzhao_: no
[00:17:30] <Cork> samzhao_: live is dropped with the new on format; and thats cause its syntax is diseptive
[00:18:12] <Cork> samzhao_: you can express $('selector').live('click') as $(document).delegate('selector', 'click') though
[00:18:23] <Whirl3d> Cork, did .is exist in 1.52?
[00:18:39] <Cork> its from 1.3 or something like that
[00:18:44] <Cork> might even be earlier
[00:18:48] <Cork> ?.is
[00:18:49] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[00:18:53] <samzhao_> Cork: I see, thanks
[00:19:05] <Cork> heh!
[00:19:08] <Cork> its from 1.0
[00:20:48] <Christer> Anyone got the slightest idea of why i cant call a .click event on a <a> tag with the class <a class="Choose_user" href="#" >Click me </a> when its inserted with jquery and how to fix it ?
[00:21:26] <Cork> Christer: do you run the selector before or after you've added the element?
[00:21:54] <Cork> Christer: and please don't use a tag for js actions
[00:22:20] <Cork> either provide a nojs fallback or use span or similar
[00:22:47] <deeprogram> as usually, I get dom like document.getElementById();
[00:23:07] <Cork> deeprogram: sorry?
[00:23:08] <deeprogram> how can I do this with jquery ? $("#selector")[0] ?? right ?
[00:23:15] <Cork> ah, yes
[00:23:31] <deeprogram> Cork: But it not works on chrome
[00:23:38] <deeprogram> Cork: it just return html
[00:23:38] <Cork> or if you just want a property of the dom $('#selector').prop('id')
[00:23:43] <coldhead> IT NOT WORKS!!!
[00:23:51] <deeprogram> coldhead: ?
[00:23:55] <tw2113> your comprehension of engrish coldhead ?
[00:23:57] <deeprogram> coldhead: you know why ?
[00:24:13] <Cork> deeprogram: that shouldn't return html unless you have something that isn't a jquery as $
[00:24:44] <Cork> s/isn't a/isn't/
[00:25:12] <Christer> Well, its dynamically added. so it would be after. It suppose to be a search list. This is what happens: The user opens the menu, the full list of user accounts is shown, and the event triggers just fine if they click the anchored arrow i got. But when the user searches for a user account the lists gets cleared, ajax is called and it collects the information and prints it to the table with "append". but now when i click the anchor it doesn
[00:25:12] <Christer> t work.
[00:25:41] <Cork> Christer: then you need to use a delegated event listner
[00:25:58] <Cork> Christer: $('selector') searches the dom, and that happens when the line is executed
[00:26:15] <Cork> Christer: see ?.delegate and ?on
[00:26:15] <bot-t> Christer, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:26:21] <Cork> =.on
[00:26:24] <Cork> grrr
[00:26:25] <Cork> ?.on
[00:26:27] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:26:44] <Christer> Thank you, ill look into it :)
[00:26:55] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/5D7CL/ the lint on fiddle shows . unexpected . ?
[00:29:16] <fRAiLtY-> Or anyone? It's line 8
[00:29:29] <Cork> heh if (hoverMenu).hasClass("hover")
[00:29:31] <Cork> that won't work
[00:29:42] <Cork> if((hoverMenu).hasClass("hover")) {}
[00:29:52] <Cork> + $
[00:30:46] <Cork> ah no the end parantes is on the wrong place
[00:30:54] <Cork> if(hoverMenu.hasClass("hover")) {}
[00:31:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: got it.
[00:32:04] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[00:32:04] <mattyh88> hi, why isn't this working? http://jsfiddle.net/akkgd/1/ It should display an alert when I change input
[00:32:28] <Whirl3d> my bad, sorry
[00:33:03] <Cork> mattyh88: http://jsfiddle.net/akkgd/3/
[00:33:19] <Cork> change happens when you move focus out of the text field
[00:33:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Whirl3d lol this gets funnier, it fades now, but takes the button away with it on mouse out lol http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/
[00:33:53] <fRAiLtY-> then the button has gone lol
[00:34:48] <samzhao_> fRAiLtY-: your fading the button instead of the panel
[00:35:32] <fRAiLtY-> fade code: http://jsfiddle.net/5D7CL/2/
[00:35:42] <mattyh88> Cork: okay .. this was a minimized version of what i have in my application. I have the ); in that file
[00:35:54] <mattyh88> but still not working .. I'll paste the full function
[00:36:12] <Cork> mattyh88: have you checked that you move focus?
[00:37:00] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_:  dam, buttonMenu ?
[00:37:09] * joeybear nods
[00:37:23] <samzhao_> it appears to me that the buttonMenu element is faded away
[00:38:26] <fRAiLtY-> samzhao_: check it http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ changed to showMenu, now it's just the menu.. but check what happens on mouseout
[00:38:34] <fRAiLtY-> it has a spaz
[00:38:39] <fRAiLtY-> and then returns to normal
[00:38:59] <samzhao_> now it simply doesnt fade again
[00:39:05] <mattyh88> Cork: yes
[00:39:05] <samzhao_> like the first time u showed us
[00:39:16] <Whirl3d> I forgot to put .stop() in front of th fade functions
[00:39:50] <Whirl3d> and you didn't aded position:absolute to the hovermenu
[00:40:05] <Cork> mattyh88: ok, you said you hade an updated link?
[00:40:07] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: in JS ?
[00:40:21] <Whirl3d> in css
[00:40:23] <mattyh88> Cork: i have it more or less like this (with some php added to it too, but i deleted it here) http://jsfiddle.net/akkgd/5/
[00:41:02] <Whirl3d> in css, on .hoverMenu .showMenu   adding position:absolute solves the messed up layout issue.
[00:41:30] <Whirl3d> then, just add: stop() right before each fade command.
[00:42:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5D7CL/4/ for the js
[00:43:40] <Whirl3d> then in styles.css, line 717, add: position:absolute (under the .hoverMenu .showMenu class
[00:45:10] <mattyh88> Cork: the function works in jsfiddle .. hm .. but still doesn't here on my comp :/
[00:45:27] <mattyh88> Cork: i've tried putting an alert somewhere else in the file .. and that just works
[00:45:27] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: Done all that‚Ä¶  no fade lol http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/
[00:46:09] <Whirl3d> you have a typo according the console
[00:46:23] <Whirl3d> sry cached version
[00:46:54] <fRAiLtY-> no errors my end :x
[00:47:24] <Whirl3d> works fine on mine except you have to handle the special case of when someone mouses over the button and then doesn't mouse over the menu...
[00:47:51] <mattyh88> is there a way i can check if an input box has a specific event handler attached to it?
[00:48:01] <mattyh88> like the onChange event
[00:48:21] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: It works on mine, just with no fade. What browser you using?
[00:48:33] <Whirl3d> Chrome
[00:48:40] <fRAiLtY-> Me too‚Ä¶ it just doesn't fade.
[00:48:52] <dgx> How can I make fancybox stop appearing images from top-to-bottom, and be like lightbox normal transition effect?
[00:48:55] <fRAiLtY-> It was fading, before I added position:absolute;
[00:49:48] <fRAiLtY-> Nope, no fade at all.. no errors either.. :(
[00:52:08] <Christer> is there anyway to actually combine PHP with jQuery data without using ajax request?
[00:53:24] <Christer> Im thinking like: If the user hits a button, i want to perform a sql query writes to the DB that the user clicked that specific button.
[00:54:21] <Cork> Christer: no, you need to do an ajax to actually get the data to the server
[00:54:36] <Cork> Christer: unless your ok with doing the sql query in someting like localStorage :)
[00:55:58] <Christer> Yeah i tought it would be like that Cork, and thats what i have been doing (ajax requests to get server information) - but im new to jquery to i just had to ask if there is any "easier" things to do.
[00:58:40] <Cork> Christer: jquery is just a framework, it helps to do what js can do
[00:58:47] <Christer> yeah iknow.
[00:58:49] <Cork> it can't do things not posible in js
[00:58:51] <Christer> and its awesome
[00:58:59] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: Any ideas why it won't fade :(
[00:59:53] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[01:01:16] <QaDeS> hiyas. i'm making an ajax request with username and password options set. the browser (chome) sends a first request _without_ the credentials, then fails as it receives the 401 response from the server. before it broke, the browser would retry the request including the auth and it would work. any idea what might have gone wrong there?
[01:02:13] <samzhao_> anyone uses django here?
[01:02:53] <coldhead> chrome shouldn't do that QaDeS, can you show us the code?
[01:06:35] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, I am a little exhausted, so I'm not thinking clearly. Here is one way that might work, but it's overkill. Try it and see: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5D7CL/7/
[01:07:05] <Whirl3d> I didn't use any of the shortcut methods. I know for a while there were problems with the fade shortcuts, so I never use them.
[01:08:11] <Whirl3d> Jesus Christ there is the biggest horsefly ever in my room trying to make sweet love to my monitors.
[01:08:35] <xec> maybe you get a lot of tiny monityr babies?
[01:08:40] <xec> monitor*
[01:09:02] <Whirl3d> or maybe not so tiny....
[01:09:04] <xec> or, god forbid, huge horesflies
[01:09:17] <xec> horse*
[01:09:30] <Whirl3d> It might be a humming bird. Not sure
[01:09:43] <Dr-Bombay> $('#fly').attr('height', '0')
[01:10:13] <QaDeS> coldhead: does that help? http://pastie.org/3809227
[01:10:17] <Whirl3d> Let's put it this way: It's at least 100px tall
[01:10:56] <mnemoc> hi, what can I use to validate a field against some sort of pattern as the person types?
[01:12:37] <coldhead> QaDeS: how are you handling the same origin policy?
[01:14:08] <QaDeS> the script is coming from the same server, top level path
[01:14:14] <henn1nk> does someone know a script, that can do this slideshow: http://us.gateway.com/gw/en/US/content/home ? I tried myself, but i failed :-(
[01:14:45] <coldhead> QaDeS: you should just use a relative URL in that case
[01:14:50] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, it's e.pageX and e.pageY, btw. forgot to capitalize the X and Y
[01:15:35] <coldhead> QaDeS: i only see one request in chrome with this demo http://jsfiddle.net/HkRZ6/1/
[01:15:54] <coldhead> i've never used http auth with ajax though
[01:16:44] <Cork> and its a BAD idea
[01:16:53] <coldhead> its certainly a scary idea
[01:16:58] <Cork> browsers doesn't provide a way to logout from those
[01:17:01] <coldhead> i didn't even know jQuery supported it
[01:17:11] <QaDeS> coldhead, relative url doesn't work in this case. it's a mobile app that'll be packaged via phonegap later
[01:17:24] <QaDeS> the interesting part is that it used to work like 2 weeks ago
[01:17:57] <henn1nk> What i search: Slideshow with big images in the background with a part in the front to be clickable (like the site)
[01:18:30] <coldhead> isn't that going to smack into the SOP in phonegap?
[01:18:36] <coldhead> since it won't have that origin?
[01:24:15] <coldhead> am i high?
[01:24:22] <coldhead> can i kick it?
[01:24:43] <aquatix> yes you can
[01:26:34] <coldhead> i appreciate that, thanks aQuaTip
[01:26:51] <aquatix> yw :)
[01:30:38] <pneftali> hi guys - question: i got a table-like div that is toggled display when a button is clicked. it's contents are populated via ajax and is appended using .html() ... contents include links that triggers an event when clicked. problem is, it does not seem to work. any ideas ?
[01:31:45] <coldhead> have you tried restarting your browser?
[01:31:46] <samzhao_> we need more info than "it does not seem to work"
[01:31:52] <coldhead> ?demo @ pneftali
[01:31:52] <bot-t> pneftali, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:32:10] <samzhao_> +bot-t: are u a bot?
[01:32:17] <samzhao_> coldhead: are u high?
[01:33:03] <coldhead> working on it, samzhao_
[01:33:06] <coldhead> thanks for the suggestion
[01:33:25] <samzhao_> coldhead: huh? I didn't suggest u to get high..
[01:33:47] <pneftali> samzhao_: when the links are clicked alert pops up, but it doesnt
[01:34:51] <samzhao_> maybe it's because it's ajax generated? like +bot-t has said, u need to put ur code on jsfiddle or something like that
[01:35:46] <coldhead> you most certainly did, samzhao_, and i appreciate it
[01:37:02] <pneftali> samzhao_: so we can't attached listeners to ajax generated contents ?
[01:37:08] <pneftali> attach*
[01:40:46] <pneftali> hrm leme try delegate
[01:41:16] <Uareanoob> knock knock
[01:41:33] <samzhao_> Uareanoob: who's there
[01:41:57] <Uareanoob> To
[01:42:10] <Uareanoob> sam113101: To
[01:42:45] <pneftali> woho it worked :)
[01:42:45] <samzhao_> pneftali: I think that's what u need.
[01:42:59] <samzhao_> pneftali: glad to hear that
[01:43:04] <pneftali> ^_^
[01:43:07] <Robbo_> How can I make something open in a new window, do form stuff and then after the form is saved it update the old window? Simple stuff I have never actually done before
[01:44:24] <samzhao_> Robbo_: node.js?
[01:44:47] <samzhao_> Robbo_: pubsub?
[01:47:38] <Robbo_> I have a watermark system which needs to watermark attachments in a thread post when editing or posting. I don't want to take away from the post content etc, I want to open a new window and do the watermarking and once saved it close the window and go back to the other one and update the image
[01:47:56] <Robbo_> I was thinking of having it close the usual way and having it request on focus a change from the serveR?
[01:48:40] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I have used PHP and GET to transfer values from one page to another, is there a smooth way to do this in jQuery instead? (There is a prepage where the user fills out dimensions and name, a main page, where these are used in an application and a post page that needs the name of the project)
[01:52:34] <samzhao_> maybe websocket is another option?
[01:52:36] <xec> ChrisTheSorcerer: without understanding completely what you mean, i'm guessing this is a job for the server - something to store in session. if you want to store things between pages on client side you'll need cookies or similar (web storage)
[01:53:24] <henn1nk> does someone know a good textile wysiwyg editor?
[01:53:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Right now, I'm just using the URL to store it in. I send it as GET-variables and fetch it on the next page, then transfer the variables to JavaScript variables and go from there
[02:03:52] <henn1nk> i need this for customers, that doesn't know the textile syntax. so markitup wouldn't really helpful here
[02:04:27] <sweb> jquery dev channel ?
[02:04:58] <sweb> ?
[02:05:14] <ChrisTheSorcerer> yup
[02:05:54] <sweb> have jquery a stable template engine with fully support in future ?
[02:06:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> henn1nk: I dont' think there's any wysiwyg for Textile out there... you might need to make one yourself
[02:06:14] <samzhao_> henn1nk: have you tried tinyMCE?
[02:06:38] <henn1nk> samzhao_: tinymce produces html and not textile syntax
[02:06:51] <Robbo_> I have tinymce
[02:07:40] <samzhao_> henn1nk: alright
[02:07:59] <sweb> have jquery a stable template engine with fully support in future ?
[02:08:20] <henn1nk> samzhao_: i don't want let the users create html code ... :-)
[02:09:04] <samzhao_> henn1nk: tinyMCE doesn't require you to write html
[02:09:22] <henn1nk> samzhao_: tinymce produces html. that's the problem.
[02:09:49] <samzhao_> henn1nk: so your worrying about the security of it?
[02:09:50] <D4> var images[] = $('img').attr('src'); $(images).each( function() { var img = $('<img />').attr('src', this); }) <-- would that work to load every image?
[02:10:06] <henn1nk> samzhao_: and the resulting style
[02:10:27] <samzhao_> henn1nk: got it
[02:19:34] <quicksilver> D4: nope. That's not valid javascript and also doesn't make much sense.
[02:19:43] <quicksilver> D4: images automatically load, what are you trying to do?
[02:21:15] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I think D4 might try to fill a list with images... or append a HTML image tag to each of them.... I think
[02:21:46] <D4> No, I'm trying to load the images - preload them so to speak
[02:22:36] <D4> Such as var image = $('<img />').attr('src', '/path/to/image.png'); would load that specific image I would like to load all images on a specific page.
[02:22:54] <quicksilver> all images on your page load immediately that the browser loads your page
[02:22:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: They load automatically... If you want to hold off everything else until the images are loaded, try window.onload()
[02:23:07] <quicksilver> although of course it takes time
[02:23:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry, image.onload()
[02:23:11] <quicksilver> not sure what you mean by "preload"
[02:23:35] <quicksilver> preloading in javascript is normally about preloading images which *aren't* on your page
[02:23:41] <quicksilver> which is a different thing...
[02:23:59] <D4> Trying to make sure they're in the dom before anything else is being run; so window.onload( wut ) ?
[02:24:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: The code you just wrote is the same as manually write <img src="/path/to/image.png" />
[02:24:32] <ChrisTheSorcerer> image.onload(function() { What you want to do when the image has been loaded });
[02:24:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> window.onload(function() { What you want to do when the page has been loaded });
[02:25:02] <quicksilver> if you want your javascript to wait until all images are loaded, use $(window).load(...)
[02:25:19] <quicksilver> .ready(), by design, does *not* wait until the images are loaded
[02:25:25] <quicksilver> that's pretty much the point of readt()
[02:25:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> or what quicksilver said, that might be a better way
[02:25:30] <quicksilver> to fire as soon as the DOM is ready.
[02:26:06] <D4> As is now, I'm using $(document).ready( myStuff ); so if I were to change that to $(window).load() ?
[02:26:50] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: Then it would wait until the page has loaded until it fires it off
[02:27:11] <D4> Would that include all <img /> being fetched etc?
[02:27:16] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yes
[02:27:52] <D4> And can I somehow display something until the page has loaded? Like, well a loader?
[02:28:12] <quicksilver> you can put something up in .ready() which you then remove in .load()....
[02:28:35] <NodeX> how long does your page take to load lol ... a loader may cause some serious page flicker
[02:28:49] <ChrisTheSorcerer> For a loader you would need something else, it will display the regular "page loading"-stuff, the user would see the page load as normal, but your other scripts wont fire off until the HTML-part is fully loaded
[02:29:19] <D4> Well, it's not the actual loading itself.. (or it might be), but it's slow. I'm trying a few different things to speed things up. It's a parallax and so it seems "slow" at times, especially if you start scrolling until everything has loaded.
[02:29:58] <NodeX> perhaps look at lazy loading your heavy content
[02:30:54] <D4> ChrisTheSorcerer ª Well, basically just hiding <body> and then showing it would do, or whatever. Doesn't have to be a "preloader", but if the page is half-loaded and the user starts "using", it's slower than if the user waits a sec or two more ;p
[02:31:08] <ChrisTheSorcerer> If it is big images resized by CSS or attributes, like thumbnails, you might want to look into having smaller images as thumbnails
[02:31:23] <sweb> hey guys i have a simple question
[02:32:01] <sweb> i want to know about jQuery template engine
[02:32:03] <D4> Yes, .css() resizing images is one of the issues -- only if the images are scaled "more" than the original size though. But these are used as background images so I cannot use any thumbs here; just by increasing the original size of the images the page got a lot faster
[02:32:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: When I have pages like that, I usually have a timed event that hides the wrapper div and shows a div in the middle of the screen, with the words "Please wait" adding a dot every second :P
[02:33:00] <D4> ChrisTheSorcerer ª I'm using a wrapper as well, so basically I could, in the .ready(), make sure #wrapper is hidden and #loader is visible, and then in .load() vise-versa?
[02:33:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> sweb: I'm sorry, we don't mean to ignore you, but at least I don't know enough to know what "the jQuery template engine" is...
[02:33:53] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: Yeah! It won't speed up the loading, it might even slow it down, but it will prevent people from using the page until it's loaded
[02:33:55] <sweb> ChrisTheSorcerer: somthing like jTemplate or JSrender. jquery have it but i think it wans not development in future http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[02:34:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> sweb: The info you seek is right on the top of the page you linked: "The jQuery team has decided not to take this plugin past beta. It is no longer being actively developed or maintained."
[02:35:00] <sweb> ChrisTheSorcerer: so jquery have not template engine in future ?
[02:35:01] <D4> ChrisTheSorcerer ª Any other tips for speeding up the page functionality? It's poorly written but, as said - increasing the original "background" image sized helped a lot, since scaling images up with .css() was _MUCH_ more needy than down ;p
[02:35:21] <D4> sizes* even
[02:36:14] <ChrisTheSorcerer> D4: There are a lot of optimization tips out there, I would have to see your source code to know specifically what you need, and I don't have time for that right now ;) Check out http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[02:39:22] <ChrisTheSorcerer> sweb: Doesn't look like it, no
[02:44:18] <Christer> Is there any jQuery UI code hinting support on the AptanaStudio 3.0 ?
[02:44:33] <Christer> i could find the Aptana channel, so i might as well give it a shot here.
[02:44:38] <Christer> could not *
[02:46:34] <D4> ChrisTheSorcerer ª Any chance I could give you the url for a quick check whenever you've got a spare minute or two? I've managed to "optimize" it except for one behavior and it's when you're at the top, either scrolling to the absolute top or going from top. It's like a "jitter" but on the page, say half way down, it's quite fluid now.
[02:46:37] <vectorshelve> how can I get the position of a fixed element with jquery relative to the begining of doc window... ie coordinates (0,0) ?
[02:47:31] <vectorshelve> Cork: ^^
[02:48:22] <Cork> ?.position
[02:48:23] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[02:48:31] <Cork> hmm
[02:48:32] <Cork> nope
[02:48:37] <Cork> ?.offset
[02:48:37] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[02:48:46] <Cork> vectorshelve: ^
[02:51:05] <vectorshelve> Cork: It doesnt work for me... http://jsfiddle.net/m4rk89/kVJ4x/ When u click on the image it returns 10 and then I scroll down and when i click again I want it to still return 0 instead it is returning another coordinate values  for both .position and .offset
[02:51:45] <Cork> vectorshelve: ah but that is its posision
[02:51:52] <Cork> its position: fixed
[02:52:07] <Cork> its not positioned relative to the document, its the window
[02:52:34] <Cork> you would have to calculate that your self, with window.scrollTop
[02:52:40] <vectorshelve> Cork: ok but I need it to return 10 all the time.. that is its fixed potition.. not the relative one I guess with respect to its parent offset or something.. I want it to return its actual coordinates all the time.. any ways ?
[02:53:09] <Cork> hmm one sec
[02:53:14] <Cork> (that is what it should return)
[02:53:25] <vectorshelve> Cork: sure.... right
[02:54:01] <thirdknife> how can i find the first next element which matches my criteria?
[02:54:24] <Cork> interesting
[02:54:29] <Cork> didn't know position changed
[02:54:38] <Cork> vectorshelve: http://jsfiddle.net/kVJ4x/6/
[02:55:10] <vectorshelve> Cork: thanks... what does it do ?
[02:55:22] <Cork> grabs the css left: value
[02:55:34] <Cork> uh...
[02:55:36] <Cork> *top
[02:55:37] <Cork> XD
[02:55:58] <vectorshelve> Cork: oh k... thanks... :) but is it a proper way to do in the cases of dynamic elements ?
[02:56:19] <Cork> vectorshelve: yes
[02:56:28] <vectorshelve> Cork: Hmm.. interesting thanks mate
[02:56:30] <Cork> fixed elements only have an x, y cordinat for its position
[02:56:35] <Cork> its not relative to anything
[02:56:47] <Cork> (well except the window)
[02:57:06] <vectorshelve> Cork: yep... and thats what I want it to be.. :)
[02:57:41] <Cork> if you want a mathimatical number use parseInt($('#fixed').css('top'), 10)
[02:58:04] <Cork> (10 is for 10 base)
[02:58:20] <vectorshelve> Cork: to remove the px ?
[02:58:25] <Cork> yes
[02:58:29] <vectorshelve> Cork: hmm
[02:59:15] <Cork> you could posibly use computed css but i don't think jquery offsers that
[02:59:24] <vectorshelve> Cork: thanks... Jquery Prince  ;)
[02:59:30] <Cork> heh

[04:03:04] <Damian__> Hi guys, I need to build something like this flash animation on http://matrix-design.com/ and this is how far I've come http://jsfiddle.net/u3umY/4/, I'm a complete noob and still reading a lot/learning so if someone would help I'd love you forever :)
[04:05:13] <nVee-Work> I am returning a json array from my ajax call and want to output the html in a table. I would preferrably like to build the table dynamically, with the json key being the <th> and the value in a <td>. Can someone maybe advise me on how to best do this? in PHP I could have done a foreach($array as $key => $value) but I am not sure how to get the individual keys in a json object
[04:07:27] <thinced> nVee-Work: Table sorter jQuery plugin is what you need
[04:08:07] <ML74> Could someone help with the image carousel? There's 10 <li> tags, yet there's only 3 showing and it's jumping back and forward.

[04:13:08] <nVee-Work> hey ckknight: Wow thats pretty intense haha :P
[04:13:18] <nVee-Work> *Giving away my javascript knowledge*
[04:13:51] <ckknight> that's just how object key-value iteration works.
[04:14:01] <ckknight> I agree that the syntax is horrendous
[04:20:28] <nVee-Work> ckknight: Would you mind if I run it by you? in this case, my object is called results, so would I do for( var key in results) { if(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(results, key) { var value = results[key]; } } ?
[04:20:49] <ckknight> correct
[04:20:59] <nVee-Work> yay, now lets test it :P
[04:21:02] <ckknight> well, you're missing a )
[04:21:13] <ckknight> which is my bad, I forgot to include it
[04:21:28] <ckknight> for (var key in results) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(results, key)) { var value = results[key]; } }
[04:24:40] <nVee-Work> ckknight: The first meaningful thing I have done today :) Thank you so much for your help!!!
[04:25:02] <ckknight> best of luck.
[04:29:09] <BadCodSmell> How can I get  the jquary UI datepicker to show the done button when inline?
[04:29:29] <auska> Hi! Is there any why that using jquery I can detect an event when the user is going to close the window of my website, when is going to leave?
[04:29:53] <BadCodSmell> can't you google jquery detect window close?
[04:33:27] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?unload auska
[04:33:29] <bot-t> ChrisTheSorcerer, Couldn't find "unload auska" in jQuery Docs.

[04:34:15] <Robbo_> when you click to do something and it does the facebook allowing stuff and then goes back to the site you were on... what method is used? is it an iframe?
[04:34:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> isn't facebook allowing stuff a popup?
[04:35:06] <Robbo_> it opens a new window
[04:35:09] <Robbo_> same with sharing
[04:35:47] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yeah, taht's a popup
[04:35:52] <Nece228> hello
[04:35:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Hi
[04:36:20] <Robbo_> How can I do that sort of thing? And when going back to the other window it knows and updates accordingly
[04:36:39] <Nece228> how to add additional variables after newcrap: match:   $.post('livesearch.php', {newcrap: match},
[04:38:20] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Robbo_: I think that might be a plugin, found something about bPopup plugin on Google
[04:39:16] <Robbo_> I was thinking of open new window like usual, do the form stuff and after save have it close the window... then when the other one gets focus check server for changes... however I can't help to think there is a very simple way to acheive this
[04:39:25] <BadCodSmell> ... Datepicker ... adds datepicker functionality to your pages. You can ... and ###add in buttons### and ... easily. <<< How?
[04:40:50] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Robbo_: If you send stuff to the server, you can have a script checking for when your main window gets focus and do an ajax query to the server
[04:41:06] <Robbo_> Yeah that's what I said or meant to say
[04:41:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Isn't that very simple?
[04:42:18] <Robbo_> Sounds like something that would have a different method, well I thought... just sounds hacky to me
[04:42:22] <Robbo_> Anyways better get to it, thanks.
[04:43:16] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I think that's why there's plugins out there, but as I see it (with my limited knowledge), it shouldn't be more than about 10 rows of code, 3 if you write the ajax call inline
[04:43:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Good luck anyway ;)
[04:44:09] <Nece228> is this valid syntax? $.post('livesearch.php', {search_term: search_term, newcrap: match}
[04:45:13] <pachet> Nece228: throw your closing call ) on the end after the obj literal, and yes
[04:45:33] <Nece228> yes i have closing bracket it just didnt fit the line so...
[04:45:48] <Nece228> thanks for info
[04:49:39] <Trudko> guys I am using async.Ajax call (let's say I have to) in order to get  some info for validation, obviously problem is that I will return valu(true or false) before request with info will return. is there way who to handle it without using sync. call?
[04:50:38] <pachet> do the validation in the .ajax success callback
[04:51:28] <supermanjnk> wc
[04:51:28] <caniuse> supermanjnk: WEB CLOASED >: |
[04:52:10] <Trudko> pachet will check it , and how about using pure javascript?someting like i mentioned in js channel -> http://jsfiddle.net/qWyvN/12/ this is my first choice before using jquery
[04:55:15] <omolio> hello. i want two conditions to be true in my filter :eq(5) and  :lt(20). does anyone know a way to achieve this?
[04:56:15] <quicksilver> omolio: did you try ":eq(5):lt(20)"?
[04:56:29] <quicksilver> although it seems to me that's the same as :eq(5)
[04:56:32] <quicksilver> so I'm not sure what you really want
[04:56:43] <pachet> it would just ignore the lt
[04:56:47] <pachet> eq is precedental :[
[04:57:09] <pachet> would be like doing something like $('.foo #bar') :[
[04:58:39] <omolio> quicksilver: i want to select elements from index 5 to index 20
[04:59:18] <NodeX> anyone use fckeditor and have problems with html tags inside it being lost
[04:59:45] <NodeX> for example if you are trying to psate in some html inside a <div> the <div> gets lost
[05:00:05] <pachet> omolio: that'd be gt
[05:00:39] <omolio> pachet: gt is greater than but I want greater or equal than
[05:00:39] <omolio> #
[05:01:15] <pachet> omolio : $('div').slice(4,20)
[05:02:05] <quicksilver> you can use :gt and :lt together but it's a bit confuse
[05:02:07] <quicksilver> confusing
[05:02:10] <quicksilver> slice preferred.
[05:02:32] <_druu> hey there! http://recursive-design.com/blog/2007/12/18/jquery-simplecolor-color-picker/   need an slightly advanced alternative‚Ä¶ suggestions? (I need external color settings mostly)

[05:12:48] <Nece228> hello
[05:13:29] <Nece228> say i have text field with something typed in it, i put in a variable, but how to store that variable value permanently?
[05:13:41] <quicksilver> what does "permanently" mean?
[05:13:53] <quicksilver> variables stay around until the window/tab is closed or navigated away from
[05:14:19] <Nece228> well im not sure, but then how to make them stay after tab is closed?
[05:14:58] <pachet> write them to the server
[05:15:01] <Cork> Nece228: you would have to store it ither server side, cookie or one of the client side storages
[05:15:04] <pachet> or store them in a cookie/localstorage/whatever
[05:15:06] <pachet> ^
[05:15:09] <Cork> *either
[05:15:40] <Cork> i would recoment server side though
[05:16:52] <Nece228> well do you know php?
[05:17:07] <Nece228> i have written web scraping app, code is kind of messy
[05:21:56] <UppityTeapot> quick question: how do you select child CSS attributes? Would it be $(".element1 .child")?
[05:22:21] <Nece228> cant figure this out, one variable search_term always goes away when i click on link
[05:22:28] <Nece228> this is jqery code: http://paste.opensuse.org/80655495
[05:22:45] <egrouse> yes UppityTeapot
[05:22:52] <egrouse> same as in css
[05:22:54] <Whirl3d> I didnt' see in the api where .load had a success/fail callback. I assume that it's $(el).load(url, complete); where complete is the callback that returns text (for html) and a status object...is that correct?
[05:23:03] <Nece228> this is php part of code: http://paste.opensuse.org/57190357
[05:23:15] <UppityTeapot> egrouse: thanks :) I like it when things are the same as CSS!
[05:25:00] <Woet> Nece228: did skelbiu.lt give you permission to scrape their site?
[05:25:15] <Nece228> yeah
[05:25:27] <Woet> Nece228: then ask them to give you a proper output like JSON or XML.
[05:25:36] <Nece228> they dont have one
[05:25:39] <Nece228> actually i dont need
[05:25:44] <Nece228> i just need to fix that last bit

[05:31:24] <sweb> my selector is wrong ?
[05:31:27] <sweb> $('input[name="data[category][]"').each(function(){

[05:32:41] <pachet> sweb: $('input[name="data//category//]//[//]"]')
[05:32:44] <pachet> uglier than sin, but
[05:33:02] <pachet> oh woops, * data//[category, rather
[05:33:15] <pachet> oh bleh
[05:33:20] <pachet> those are backslashes
[05:33:23] <pachet> *\
[05:33:36] <pachet> jeez, i need coffee injected into my eyeballs
[05:33:52] <sweb> $('input[name="data//[category//]//[//]"]') ?
[05:34:09] <pachet> backslashes
[05:34:31] <quicksilver> each [ or ] needs to be \\[ or \\]
[05:34:49] <sweb> $('input[name="data\[category\]\[\]"\]') ?
[05:34:56] <quicksilver> you need \\
[05:35:06] <quicksilver> because javascript eats one \ before jquery sees it
[05:35:21] <pachet> $('input[name="data\\[category\\]\\[\\]"]');
[05:35:31] <quicksilver> "\\[" is a javascript string of length 2
[05:35:39] <quicksilver> ?eval "\\[".length
[05:35:41] <bot-t> quicksilver: 2
[05:39:08] <pachet> peterschmidler: $.ajax({url:'save.php', type:'POST', data:{img_data:canvasElement.toDataURL("img/png")});
[05:39:20] <pachet> then in php just grab it with $_POST['img_data']
[05:39:32] <pachet> HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is less reliable
[05:39:56] <peterschmidler> pachet: I'll try it‚Ä¶ Thanks
[05:40:02] <Cork> quicksilver: you don't need to escape [] inside a second string
[05:40:04] <mbrevda> I have a table where the data gets real long. I've set a width on a span wrapping the data, and animate that width to 100% on hover (so that all the data can be seen). Question: how can I keep the table from resizing when that one cell grows to show all its data?
[05:40:31] <Cork> $('input[name="data[category][]"]'); should work just find, as long as thats the name
[05:40:35] <Cork> *fine
[05:41:15] <Cork> its $('input[name=data[category][]]'); that needs to be escaped
[05:42:43] <pachet> oh, Cork wins
[05:42:45] <pachet> Cork++
[05:43:27] <Cork> i've made the same mistake not too long ago, thats why i know :)

[05:45:34] <quicksilver> Cork: ah :) good to know.
[05:45:41] <peterschmidler> How can I receive something with this function?
[05:46:38] <Cork> peterschmidler: .load?
[05:46:52] <Cork> or what function are you talking about
[05:47:12] <vitsaus_> ah, ei ois en‰‰ pitk‰ p‰iv‰
[05:47:25] <Cork> vitsaus_: english please
[05:47:54] <vitsaus_> Cork: whops, wrong channel anyway. sorry

[05:57:33] * mbrevda discovers nextAll()
[05:58:56] <Nece228> whats the syntax to unbind this: $('#button').click(function() {
[05:59:38] <peterschmidler> Cork: https://gist.github.com/2410299
[05:59:39] <mbrevda> $(this).unbind('event1 event2'), iirc
[05:59:46] <quicksilver> $('#button').unbind('click')
[05:59:55] <quicksilver> although if you have more than one click handler than unbinds them all
[06:00:05] <Nece228> i have only one
[06:00:06] <Nece228> thanks
[06:00:22] <Nece228> you know im such an ass to ask that
[06:00:27] <Nece228> but i couldnt help myself
[06:03:35] <pachet> i'd strongly advocate using .on and .off
[06:03:38] <pachet> and namespacing
[06:03:46] <pachet> even if you're only planning on binding a single event
[06:03:51] <pachet> makes everything scale more fluidly!

[06:04:59] <Trisox> last each loop
[06:05:57] <peterschmidler> How can I get the "Success!" into query? https://gist.github.com/gists/2410299/
[06:08:35] <Trisox> got it nm
[06:09:21] <z315l> clear
[06:09:29] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/mJrKy/
[06:09:33] <Trisox> thats it
[06:10:29] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/cnFVbJtv         <<< this doesn't seem to work, am I using the right method?
[06:10:32] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: You about mate?
[06:10:56] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ I have a fade on my menu when you hover the big pink button at the top, but for some reason it doesn't go away when you moseout?
[06:11:06] <fRAiLtY-> It's meant to hover in/out
[06:12:13] <pachet> Trisox: without picking apart what you were experimenting with : http://jsfiddle.net/9fkPv/
[06:12:20] <pachet> that said, you can make some improvements
[06:12:48] <pachet> 1) as you can see, there's no difference between elem.width() and parseInt(elem.css('width'), 10)
[06:13:24] <pachet> that said, if you're using parseInt you should 1) specify the radix ( almost always 10 ) and 2) realize that there's no point in calling replace
[06:13:31] <pachet> eg .replace('px', '')
[06:13:39] <pachet> because parseInt will ignore trailing non-numeric characters
[06:14:16] <Ortund> anyone know why this isn't working? It's supposed to clear the text out of the textbox on click >>> http://pastebin.com/cnFVbJtv
[06:14:25] <pachet> i also saved your selected $('div a') elements to a variable, to prevent having to call that selector multiple times
[06:17:01] <Trisox> pachet: nice
[06:17:08] <Trisox> i was playing around mostly
[06:17:19] <Trisox> no optimizing stuff :)
[06:18:02] <dannN> Hi. Is it possible to perform an action on 2 classes? $('.poster, #header').show(); or something like that?
[06:18:11] <quicksilver> dannN: yes, exactly like that.
[06:18:18] <dannN> quicksilver: thank you!
[06:18:40] <Ortund> can anyone see why this isn't working? It's supposed to clear the text out of the textbox on click >>> http://pastebin.com/cnFVbJtv
[06:19:05] <johnkpaul> Ortund: $(this) is a jquery object
[06:19:11] <johnkpaul> you can just use this.value = "";
[06:19:20] <Jon47> Ortund ytou're accessing a DOM node property (value) of a jquery object
[06:19:29] <johnkpaul> if you don't need any jquery functionality, there's no use in creating a jquery object by using $()
[06:20:06] <quicksilver> johnkpaul: there is some small benefit in having uniformity in your code, if you use .val() everywhere else...
[06:20:10] <Ortund> I thought $(this) referenced the control that triggered the event
[06:20:17] <quicksilver> johnkpaul: even though it's infinitesimally slower.
[06:20:31] <dannN> quicksilver: $('.cvUI-box_opener .opener_icon, .cvUI-box_opener .icon-new_messages').click(function() does not work
[06:21:02] <nvez> dannN: try typing $('.cvUI-box_opener .opener_icon, .cvUI-box_opener .icon-new_messages') alone in dev console
[06:21:08] <nvez> see it it returns the elements you want
[06:21:25] <johnkpaul> quicksilver: yeah, I agree, it isn't really a performance penalty I'm worried about, just better understanding
[06:21:51] <nvez> biggest jquery problem => wanting to learn jquery before fully understanding javascript :p
[06:21:51] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ I have a fade on my menu when you hover the big pink button at the top, but for some reason it doesn't go away when you moseout? It's meant to hover in/out
[06:22:20] <quicksilver> johnkpaul: yes. It's good to understand they're the same. It's also good to have coding styles and stick to them. On the other hand it's good to get stuff done, as well. :)
[06:22:48] <nvez> buttonMenu.bind("mouseenter", showMenu);
[06:22:53] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: where's your mouseout binding?
[06:23:17] * Zarutian has a question: why should I use jquery (or any js framework at all)? the stuff I heard about it just makes it sound like an empty abstraction that takes up bandwidth, memory and cpu in people's webbrowsers with no much of benefits.
[06:23:19] <TAiS46> Hello, before i will submit my form, i will make an ajax load. if the load is success i will submit the form, otherwise i will show an error. i try to stop submitting with return false; but it won't work http://jsfiddle.net/JBDr6/
[06:23:29] <Trisox> pachet: :-)  thnx
[06:23:37] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: How can I add one?
[06:23:58] <Ortund> johnkpaul even when I change $(this) to $(".vmake") it still doesn't work
[06:24:03] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: http://jsfiddle.net/wUNpt/
[06:24:06] <fRAiLtY-> That's my code
[06:24:20] <nvez> TAiS46: look into e.preventDefault()
[06:24:48] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: check out hover, you can pass it two callbacks, on hover in and and out
[06:25:06] <nvez> so you don't have to do odd calculations and stuff
[06:25:08] <nvez> ^hover
[06:25:12] <nvez> how did this bot work again.
[06:25:12] <nvez> lol
[06:25:27] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:26:08] <nvez> so you can do button.hover(showMenu, hideMenu);
[06:26:09] <nvez> should work
[06:26:18] <johnkpaul> Ortund: that's not what I said
[06:26:20] <johnkpaul> ?val @Ortund
[06:26:21] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .val(): Set the value of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[06:26:21] <bot-t1> Ortund, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[06:26:27] <quicksilver> ?hover @ nvez
[06:26:27] <caniuse> nvez: .hover(): Bind a single handler to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:26:27] <bot-t1> nvez, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:26:33] <nvez> ah
[06:26:38] <nvez> do we really need to bots though. :p
[06:26:40] <nvez> *two
[06:26:42] <quicksilver> do we really need two?
[06:26:56] <smplstk> god damnit bot-t
[06:27:02] <nvez> high availability and redundancy.
[06:27:04] <smplstk> why can't you just keep one name!
[06:27:07] <nvez> <insert more buzzwords>
[06:27:24] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: I was having issues with hover earlier hence why Whirl3d helped me with this method, I just need a mouse leave event right?
[06:27:30] <blez> where to find good examples of resizable()?
[06:27:33] <fRAiLtY-> To return it to it's original state?
[06:27:43] <nvez> yep, but instead of doing that, use .hover -- it'll take care of knowing when it goes in and when it goes out
[06:27:55] <nvez> and it's built in jquery, so it probably works really well ;)
[06:28:15] <nvez> I actually think you can just get away with button.hover(showMenu, hideMenu) -- try that out
[06:28:20] <smplstk> BLAM
[06:29:16] <nvez> i have a question, why do devs really like linode?
[06:29:37] <smplstk> nvez: it's simple and cheap
[06:30:03] <nvez> hm i see.   guess so, never dealt with them, might try it out
[06:30:55] <smplstk> nvez: Have you ever used VPS style hosting before?
[06:31:25] <smplstk> The only thing is, you do 100% of the configuration, nothing comes preinstalled.
[06:31:33] <smplstk> Like say, Rackspace, or something similar.
[06:31:34] <nvez> smplstk: i actually work in one and we have a really good control panel (proprietary), but we've launched recently.  i was just wondering why people liked linode so much
[06:31:42] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: I don't have a hide menu
[06:31:46] <fRAiLtY-> It's hidden to start with
[06:32:05] <nvez> we have all the templates, firewall features, etc.  it's notbad.png but just wondering what attracts people to linode so much
[06:32:25] <smplstk> I just heard good things.
[06:32:29] <smplstk> and started using it
[06:32:42] <smplstk> they have some good control panel suff too
[06:32:53] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: gotcha, but what .hover does is call the first callback when its hovered, and call the second one when it hovers out.  ex: showMenu will be called after its hovered on, hideMenu will be called ONLY if it's hovered on and the mouse went out
[06:33:05] <smplstk> and for $20 a month, it's a decent price tag.
[06:33:19] <fRAiLtY-> But hideMenu doesn't exist, how can it call it?
[06:33:30] <nvez> oh, you dont have that function?  i thought i saw it
[06:33:30] <Ortund> johnkpaul, I've tried $(this).val(""); $(".vmake").val(""); $(this).val() = ""; $(".vmake").val() = ""; ... nothing works
[06:34:11] <nvez> smplstk: the thing is we've been in business for a long time so we have huge resources, and for $25 you can get a server with almost twice the specs
[06:34:31] <nvez> and it's by no means cheap hardware, all running on Dell C6100's -- etc -- so yeah, just wondering how they do it ;)
[06:34:32] <nvez> brb!
[06:35:01] <johnkpaul> ?focus @ Ortund
[06:35:02] <bot-t1> Ortund, .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[06:36:13] <johnkpaul> nvez: it's called overcommitment, I think
[06:36:18] <johnkpaul> there's a business term for it
[06:37:12] <Ortund> johnkpaul linking api calls in an attempt to help someone is like instructing someone on disarming a nuclear bomb over the phone by saying "wire"
[06:37:28] <Ortund> there's no context, ergo, as helpful as a hole in the head
[06:37:59] <johnkpaul> :) if this was disarming a nuclear bomb and not free help on the internet, I'd apologize profusely
[06:38:09] <johnkpaul> you're using click when you should be using focus on an input
[06:38:23] <smplstk> ?get as smplstk
[06:38:31] <bot-t1> smplstk, Couldn't find "get as smplstk" in jQuery Docs.
[06:38:39] <smplstk> ?get @ smplstk
[06:38:39] <bot-t1> smplstk, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[06:38:42] <smplstk> :|
[06:38:48] <Ortund> so why the hell didn't you just say that in the first fucking place? Now I've wasted 2 hours because you can't just give a straight answer
[06:38:56] <smplstk> caniuse json sockets canvas
[06:38:56] <caniuse> smplstk: You can use JSON parsing, Web Sockets, and Canvas (basic support) with Firefox 6, and Chrome 14. http://caniuse.com/#search=json http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets http://caniuse.com/#search=canvas
[06:39:02] * smplstk nods
[06:39:45] <nvez> johnkpaul: overselling, aware of it and we do none of it (based on Xen, so we actually _cant_ do it)
[06:40:41] <Ortund> and of course .focus doesn't make it work either... nevermind, I'll find a solution myself
[06:42:01] <nvez> jeez
[06:42:18] <nvez> i think he doesnt understand that irc is for helping you find the solution, not for finding you the solution...
[06:42:53] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: can you help http://jsfiddle.net/RgN6a/ I've got this and it fades in and out when I hover. I think I've got it mixed up somewhere. http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ there's the page
[06:42:55] <smplstk> some people have high expectations.
[06:43:42] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: check this -- http://jsfiddle.net/NRxen/
[06:43:46] <smplstk> fRAiLtY-: you should probablly set up the fiddle properly as a working demo
[06:43:48] <nvez> damnit forgot to save, hold on..
[06:44:09] <fRAiLtY-> lol
[06:45:43] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/gZtYS/
[06:45:45] <nvez> with example and all
[06:45:49] <pachet> Ortund: works for me : http://jsfiddle.net/Y5Nx5/
[06:45:54] <pachet> .val(), that is
[06:46:01] <nvez> pachet: he rage quit irc :<
[06:46:09] <pachet> oh
[06:46:16] <pachet> one down
[06:46:27] <nvez> also, placeholder= for html5 and get jquery plugin for fallback = cleaner solution :p
[06:46:34] <nvez> i try to avoid writing as much code as i can usually.
[06:46:59] <pachet> oh is that what he was trying to do?
[06:47:18] <pachet> i just tend to write a perscription for the medicine the patient asks for, even if its the wrong medicine ;p
[06:47:39] <TAiS46> nvez: i have play a little bit arround, but i can't finde a solution ... http://jsfiddle.net/JBDr6/1/ the form will not be submitted if the load will success
[06:48:43] <smplstk> nvez, fRAiLtY-: I threw some stop()'s in so it doesn't stack the animations: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/gZtYS/1/
[06:48:54] <nvez> yeah that would be the next step :p
[06:49:08] <nvez> TAiS46: are you getting the alert("ERROR") ?
[06:49:25] <TAiS46> yes, if the load will not success
[06:50:08] <nvez> TAiS46: is #buy the form element or the submit button?
[06:50:16] <TAiS46> form element
[06:51:00] <nvez> try throwing event.preventDefault(); after the alert('error')
[06:51:10] <nvez> and get rid of self = this and the .submit
[06:51:14] <blez> http://i44.tinypic.com/250qxkh.png how to make the dashed border div be around the button?
[06:51:20] <blez> the div is with class: .draggable { display: inline-block; padding: 2px; border:1px dashed gray; position: absolute; width: auto; height: auto; }
[06:51:27] <BadCodSmell> In an event handler function, it is possible to wait for all other even functions to finish before fireing?
[06:51:29] <blez> and I'm using .resizable()
[06:51:38] <BadCodSmell> before doing work* such as ev.waitforothers();
[06:51:56] <Trisox> outline: 0;
[06:52:00] <Trisox> blez
[06:52:44] <blez> Trisox no changes
[06:52:44] <PigDude> so zepto is jquery lite, not working on IE?
[06:52:50] <PigDude> what about IE8, 9, or 10?
[06:53:50] <TAiS46> nvez: if i throw the event.preventDefault(); after alert() ... i will get the alert message and the form will submit!
[06:54:21] <nvez> you know what
[06:54:24] <nvez> try getting rid of the alerts
[06:54:27] <nvez> and see if it works..
[06:54:57] <fRAiLtY-> smplstk, nvez: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/ the fade doesn't work, no js errors :(
[06:55:09] <fRAiLtY-> What am I doing wrong?
[06:55:34] <pifantastic> TAiS46: in your code, self refers to a DOMElement
[06:55:37] <pifantastic> not a jQuery collection
[06:55:44] <pifantastic> try $(self).submit();
[06:56:27] <pifantastic> Also TAiS46, checkout the console api, it's MUCH better than using alert() for debugging
[06:56:30] <pifantastic> ?g console api
[06:56:31] <bot-t1> pifantastic, Console API - FirebugWiki - http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[06:56:50] <pifantastic> it's supported in Firebug and Webkit Inspector
[06:56:50] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: i think it has to stop with the .stop(), try removing it and see if it works outi
[06:56:53] <TAiS46> i will try thx
[06:57:02] <nvez> i think you need to add stop(true, true)
[06:57:21] <nvez> fRAiLtY-: http://api.jquery.com/stop/ -- refer to "As of jQuery 1.7, if the first argument is provided as a string, only the animations in the queue represented by that string will be stopped." and read below that
[06:59:34] <blez> resizable se changes the padding somehow
[07:00:48] <TAiS46> pifantastic: if i will use $(self).submit(); the submit will load and load and load again!
[07:01:01] <Trisox> duh
[07:01:18] <pifantastic> TAiS46: yep
[07:01:24] <pifantastic> :P
[07:01:26] <Trisox> :P
[07:01:27] <TAiS46> but how to submit the form finaly?
[07:02:39] <TAiS46> i will only load an api on submit. if the load is success, i will submit the form
[07:05:49] <nvez> TAiS46: i think to make things easier, just "dont submit" if it fails and do nothing (let it submit on it's own) if it work
[07:05:51] <nvez> *works
[07:07:38] <fRAiLtY-> nvez, smplstk : still doesn't work, no fade, no errors :( http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/
[07:08:02] <nvez> try getting rid of the stops and see what happens
[07:08:14] <nvez> also true, true is relevant when using jquery 1.7+
[07:08:16] <nvez> you have 1.5
[07:10:12] <gnarf> true, true has been around a while
[07:10:20] <gnarf> clearQueue, gotoEnd
[07:13:46] <jwg2s> http://24.125.42.135/ can anyone suggest a smoother way to change css selectors in this instance? click log in and slider bar will come down
[07:14:47] <fRAiLtY-> nvez: Works with stop(true,true) now, one last thing, I need it to remain open when I hover over the items in the menu too if you see what I mean http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/
[07:16:02] <jwg2s> fRAiLtY-: are you talking about when hovering over browse products? just got here
[07:16:40] <fRAiLtY-> jwg2s: Hiya, when you hover browse products it shows a menu with a fade, if you go to select a menu item it goes away. I need it to remain open until you mouse out of the menu if that makes sense?
[07:17:09] <jwg2s> can you toggle the browse products div with hover?
[07:18:27] <fRAiLtY-> jwg2s: Current code: http://jsfiddle.net/UXR9P/
[07:18:31] <poppiez> SlexAxton: have you guys thought about including window.navigator.msPointerEnabled in the touch test? http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx
[07:18:37] <poppiez> (Modernizr)

[07:23:55] <granden> What am I doing wrong?
[07:23:59] <sweb>  johnkpaul: jQuery.tmpl will be deprecated in future ?
[07:24:23] <dezzz> garden> you have a type function news(artile) { should be ARTICLE
[07:24:34] <granden> haha
[07:24:44] <EdwardIII> heh i got down to 0 templating engines pretty quick
[07:25:04] <granden> still not working though
[07:25:21] <sweb> johnkpaul: ?
[07:25:38] <granden> dezzz: Changed to article but still not working.
[07:25:53] <dezzz> sorry i've justed started doing jquery today...
[07:25:54] <sweb> http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[07:25:55] <johnkpaul> sweb: I actually don't know, it's not being worked on by the jQUery team
[07:26:17] <sweb>  johnkpaul: i want to plane a big project. i need more info how can i get it ?
[07:26:28] <dezzz> can anyone help me with adding eventlisteners with jquery ? http://pastebin.com/NsKwPZmP
[07:26:41] <sweb> i need good template engine that matched with jquery for less client process
[07:26:44] <granden> Ok, anyone else who can spot what I am doing incorrect?
[07:26:46] <granden> http://pastebin.com/44B4GQLn
[07:26:54] <johnkpaul> more info about what? you should use that template engine chooser, sweb
[07:26:58] <granden> and I changed my typo that dezzz pointed out.
[07:27:21] <dezzz> maybe debug with Firebug ?
[07:27:32] <EdwardIII> heh that microtemplating thing is pretty elegant: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[07:27:33] <sweb> johnkpaul: if i know `jQuery.tmpl` will be go on on jQuery it's my choose
[07:27:50] <johnkpaul> sweb: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[07:27:59] <johnkpaul> it will not be maintained by jquery
[07:28:16] <sweb> It is no longer being actively developed or maintained. :(
[07:35:43] <johnkpaul> hey cfjedimaster
[07:35:47] <cfjedimaster> heya :)

[07:37:44] <ntry> I want to know, if there is any element that lay above another element by z-Index. Any performant ideas?
[07:37:53] <johnkpaul> is withCredentials a property directly on the XMLHttpRequest?
[07:38:13] <cfjedimaster> i saw that from a doug neiner SO post
[07:38:18] <cfjedimaster> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054316/jquery-sending-credentials-with-cross-domain-posts
[07:38:18] <johnkpaul> cfjedimaster: the jquery docs put it inside an xhrFields object
[07:38:24] <cfjedimaster> was grasping at straws
[07:38:33] <cfjedimaster> ok - trying
[07:39:06] <cfjedimaster> no go
[07:39:10] <cfjedimaster> i assume xhrFields is the second arg?
[07:39:13] <johnkpaul> are you posting any data?
[07:39:14] <cfjedimaster> beforeSend: function(xhr,xhrFields) {               xhrFields.withCredentials = true;               },
[07:39:18] <johnkpaul> no
[07:39:27] <johnkpaul> xhrFields is another property in the object's object
[07:39:33] <johnkpaul> sibling of url
[07:39:33] <cfjedimaster> oh i see
[07:39:34] <cfjedimaster> sorry
[07:40:02] <cfjedimaster> closer!
[07:40:04] <cfjedimaster> shit
[07:40:05] <cfjedimaster> no go
[07:40:06] <johnkpaul> I wish there was a way to deep link to a particular part of the ajax docs, it's pretty long
[07:40:10] <johnkpaul> :/
[07:40:20] <johnkpaul> so are you not passing any data
[07:40:23] <johnkpaul> to this post request?
[07:40:51] <ntry> I need to know if there is an element above another element, how can i check that?
[07:41:02] <cfjedimaster> nah
[07:41:16] <cfjedimaster> its supposed to get a JSON response from build.phonegap.com
[07:41:37] <johnkpaul> hm, I wonder if that could be the issue, why is it a post then?
[07:41:46] <cfjedimaster> i was trying a few things
[07:41:51] <cfjedimaster> let me go back to GET with this new mod in
[07:41:57] <johnkpaul> ok
[07:41:58] <johnkpaul> ntry: you mean position absoluted with z-index?
[07:42:12] <cfjedimaster> john: same
[07:42:18] <ntry> yes
[07:42:27] <Fiifi> have a problem using JQuery with Safari 3.2.3 the error reads Error: NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: DOM Exception 7
[07:42:48] <ntry> johnkpaul: but you can use z-Index with absolute, fixed and relative
[07:43:01] <johnkpaul> ntry: there's nothing OOTB with jquery that will give you that
[07:43:06] <NoiseEee> Fiifi: sounds like you're disobeying same-origin policy
[07:43:07] <johnkpaul> you can do all of the calculation manually
[07:43:14] <johnkpaul> using .offset
[07:43:17] <johnkpaul> ?offset @ntry
[07:43:18] <bot-t1> ntry, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:43:39] <johnkpaul> cfjedimaster: does your url have a ? in it?
[07:43:49] <ntry> ah nice
[07:43:52] <ntry> thanks
[07:43:55] <cfjedimaster> interestingly enough - no - but im seeing jquery adding a cachebuster
[07:43:58] <johnkpaul> no problem
[07:44:05] <johnkpaul> even with cache false, cfjedimaster?
[07:44:11] <cfjedimaster> yeah - thats weird
[07:44:24] <cfjedimaster> url ends up being, https://u:p@url/?_= ....
[07:44:43] <johnkpaul> oh, wait, when you said the username and pw were in the url
[07:44:55] <johnkpaul> you meant in the u:p, not the ?username=&password=
[07:45:02] <cfjedimaster> right
[07:45:04] <Fiifi> HoiseEee: how do I resolve that
[07:45:06] <cfjedimaster> its doing authorization via URL
[07:45:09] <cfjedimaster> not via header
[07:45:11] <johnkpaul> isn't that correct for basic http auth cfjedimaster?
[07:45:17] <johnkpaul> oh
[07:45:24] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: How do I resolve that error
[07:45:29] <johnkpaul> I see, I bet you'd have to do that manually
[07:45:40] <lucasw> hi am i stupid or why is this working? http://jsfiddle.net/BJMZ9/1/ ?
[07:45:50] <lucasw> why is this isnt**
[07:46:08] <johnkpaul> why does it matter, cfjedimaster? if it's not ssl, they're both use as unsecure
[07:46:12] <NoiseEee> Fiifi: what are you trying to do?
[07:46:19] <johnkpaul> but it is ssl, so it's fine
[07:46:31] <cfjedimaster> its weird - if i try the url myself - the browser ignores it and prompts me to login
[07:46:36] <cfjedimaster> something about the url is making it not work
[07:46:37] <lucasw> updated: http://jsfiddle.net/BJMZ9/2/ it prints out undefined but why?
[07:47:27] <johnkpaul> cfjedimaster: when you try manually, do you add the cachebuster?
[07:47:36] <cfjedimaster> no
[07:47:45] <cfjedimaster> i did https://u:p@url
[07:47:59] <cfjedimaster> which seems to imply the server isnt using basic auth - even though it says it is
[07:48:17] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: Any time I include the jquery library in the html page I get the Error message Error: NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: DOM Exception 7. Even when I have not used the jquery file
[07:48:35] <johnkpaul> ah, cfjedimaster, then that's a different problem
[07:48:41] <cfjedimaster> heh
[07:48:42] <NoiseEee> Fiifi: how are you including jquery?
[07:48:43] <johnkpaul> call up phonegap build
[07:48:44] <cfjedimaster> yeah :)
[07:48:44] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: It only happens for Safari 3.2.3 too
[07:48:48] <johnkpaul> tell 'em what's what
[07:48:53] <cfjedimaster> we own them now - should be easy ;)
[07:49:00] <johnkpaul> lucasw: name != id
[07:49:09] <johnkpaul> haha, cfjedimaster, that's what I call power
[07:49:40] <johnkpaul> lucasw: replace "name" with "id" in your html
[07:49:41] <johnkpaul> and it works fine
[07:49:42] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: the normal include  <script src="jquery-1.7.1.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[07:49:52] <lucasw> look again johnkpaul ?
[07:50:04] <sssilver> Hello gentlemen
[07:50:06] <johnkpaul> new url, lucasw?
[07:50:14] <lucasw> http://jsfiddle.net/BJMZ9/4/ the id is there?
[07:51:04] <sssilver> I need to create a customizable grid-based layout with arbitrary number of blocks which can be dragged to be reordered and resized. What would you recommend?
[07:51:05] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: Complains about line 6301 the line reads     div.innerHTML = wrap[1] + elem + wrap[2];
[07:52:14] <sssilver> think widgets on Androd home screen -- I need to implement something like that using jQuery
[07:52:34] <sssilver> you can rearrange the widgets and resize them arbitrarily to get any layout you want, right?
[07:53:34] <NoiseEee> Fiifi: jquery only supports safari v5+
[07:54:33] <Fiifi> NoiseEee: Sure about that
[07:54:44] <johnkpaul> hm, lucasw, I don't know
[07:55:33] <johnkpaul> oh, lucasw
[07:55:35] <NoiseEee> Fiifi: www.jquery.com
[07:55:37] <johnkpaul> 1 != l
[07:55:42] <johnkpaul> I think it's typos
[07:55:57] <johnkpaul> in some cases you havbe the number 1, in some you have the letter L lowercase
[07:56:09] <cfjedimaster> hey john - i got it working using this - http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/1/3/Parsecom--dynamic-data-storage-for-mobile
[07:56:12] <cfjedimaster> ugh - sorry for the huge url
[07:57:02] <johnkpaul> ah, great cfjedimaster
[07:57:15] <johnkpaul> using an article that you, yourself wrote
[07:57:15] <johnkpaul> :D
[07:57:40] <cfjedimaster> im old
[07:58:02] <rgr> whats the jquery approach to detaching an element and inserting it into another "#anchor" only if that anchor exists?
[07:58:33] <dezzz> can anyone help with listener in jquery? http://pastebin.com/NsKwPZmP
[07:58:54] <dezzz> somehow this doesn't work jQuery('#canvas').on('drop', handleDrop);
[07:59:15] <dezzz> whereas this worked fine canvas.addEventListener("drop", handleDrop, false);
[08:00:09] <dezzz> i tried this aswell same effect jQuery(canvas).on('drop', handleDrop);
[08:00:32] <dezzz> the listener works but it seems that the event sent is different?
[08:00:45] <dezzz> as it doesn't finish the handleDrop
[08:01:18] <dezzz> it exits here: return typeof jQuery !== "undefined" && (!e || jQuery.event.triggered !== e.type) ?
[08:01:20] <dezzz>         jQuery.event.dispatch.apply( eventHandle.elem, arguments ) :
[08:01:21] <dezzz>         undefined;
[08:08:01] <natas77> guys cann i use a clik event in if?
[08:08:25] <natas77> like this : if($(".slider_navi_item6").click
[08:08:52] <xec> natas77: i don't see why you would do that, but the expression will be executed, yes
[08:09:07] <bdiu> anyone looking for a new fulltime gig? msg me :-)
[08:09:56] <natas77> xec: i have a clik event on a container of classes and i wanna know which of the elemen ist clicked
[08:10:54] <natas77> xec: like this : http://pastebin.com/
[08:11:45] <xec> natas77: you just linked to the front page of pastebin ;)
[08:11:56] <natas77> lol sorry
[08:12:19] <natas77> xec: http://pastebin.com/1dHJFW3V
[08:12:54] <sqwk> Is it possible to tell use a different markup for query ui tabs?
[08:13:01] <natas77> my ithem container is .slider_navi_item an ther are items like .slider_navi_item1 or 2
[08:13:16] <sqwk> Makes more sense if the panels are an unordered list initially
[08:13:54] <xec> natas77: you might be able to use the event object for that, depending on your DOM structure and what you're looking for. what does your html look like?
[08:14:50] <Borad> Hey i need to know any technique to achieve something like this http://magiccitysweeps.starz.com/
[08:15:24] <xec> natas77: like e.target for instance, see http://jsfiddle.net/zbTfu/
[08:29:51] <xec> Borad: i believe the effect is called "parallax", try googling that, i don't have experience with it myself
[08:37:13] <nFFF> yea I cant decide how much I like it
[08:38:36] <xec> maybe it would be better with more rainbows. and unicorns?
[08:38:51] <xec> what am i saying? of course everything is better with unicorns!
[08:39:08] <nFFF> or naked girls. whatever floats your boat :D
[08:39:11] <gi4nluca> +i
[08:39:53] <xec> oooh that's an idea, you can scroll clothes off models
[08:40:23] <lonewolfffffff> hi, anybody use ben alman bbq plugin for jquery?
[08:40:42] <xec> ?anyone @ lonewolfffffff
[08:40:44] <bot-t1> lonewolfffffff, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[08:42:54] <lonewolfffffff> oh. if user start from page A, then click page B and go back to page A and click page C. can we delete page B from cache?
[08:43:41] <xec> cache as in browser history?
[08:44:05] <lonewolfffffff> yes, bbq cached the page B
[08:46:35] <xec> again, do you mean the browser's history log?
[08:46:53] <xec> if so, it's normal behaviour isn't it
[08:47:51] <lonewolfffffff> let me explain, my application load content using ajax
[08:48:01] <lonewolfffffff> so in order to make back button working
[08:48:16] <lonewolfffffff> i use ben alman bbq plug in as hash management
[08:48:19] <lonewolfffffff> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/
[08:49:32] <xec> lonewolfffffff: that's still not answering my question: what do you mean by "cache"? memory usage?
[08:49:41] <jkirch> anybody familiar with Daniel Harrod's JQuery UI DateTimePicker, or know how to get in touch with him?
[08:49:47] <Ste_uk> hey guys, I got a question for ya... if you upload an image using an iFrame and jQuery and then you make an img tag with the src of the new image (probably working through a php rewrite too so no malicious files can be uploaded) would it show up??
[08:50:13] <lonewolfffffff> yes, memory usage.
[08:50:44] <Ste_uk> is that answering me lonewolfffffff
[08:50:48] <Ste_uk> ?
[08:51:20] <lonewolfffffff> sorry, i was asking help from xec
[08:51:33] <nvez> Ste_uk: i am not sure if your question makes sense, but fyi jquery/javascript can't access the content of iframes
[08:52:52] <Ste_uk> i don't need to access the content of the iframe, just using the iframe for file uploading really... but one the file is uploaded i'm planning to add for instance an <img src="mynewfile.jpg" alt="My File" /> and I think it should show the image instantly without needing to refresh the page right?
[08:53:37] <Ste_uk> lol... i can't type today!!! but i'm planning to access the file after it has been uploaded* for instance....
[08:55:31] <nvez> Ste_uk: it should be possible, i dont see why not, as long as you can get the name of the uploaded file
[08:55:45] <nvez> if the uploading is done in the iframe, you might not be able to access what happens inside of it
[08:55:53] <xec> Ste_uk: when you have uploaded the image and it's stored on server, you can set the src of an img tag to its url and let the browser do the rest
[08:56:14] <xec> nvez: how sure are you about the "no access inside iframe" thing?
[08:56:17] <Ste_uk> Thanks nvez :)... yeah I shouldn't need the iFrame, thanks xec :)
[08:56:30] <nvez> xec: like 99%
[08:56:44] <nvez> xec: imagine the possibilities, ill open facebook in an iframe and the minute you load my page, i take over everything
[08:57:07] <Ste_uk> It won't be hard for me to keep the source, I've already done something similar just not done instant img tags after uploading via iFrames so I wasn't sure and I'm going to need to do it soon :)
[08:57:14] <xckpd7> what is that technical term for when you define all your variables upfront?
[08:57:23] <Ste_uk> instantiate
[08:57:40] <lonewolfffffff> nvez : cross domain?
[08:57:42] <xckpd7> no, there is a word for the act of doing it
[08:58:13] <nvez> oh nevermind, you can run functions that are inside that frame but you cant interact with the dom
[08:58:14] <nvez> i think
[08:58:22] <nvez> and only if its on the same domain/protocol/etc
[08:58:42] <xec> yeah the domain part makes sense i guess
[08:59:29] <nvez> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe
[08:59:47] <nvez> if same domain, not a problem, my bad then!
[09:00:24] <xec> the 1% strikes again!
[09:00:32] <Ste_uk> xckpd7: I'm curious now, let me know when you find it, lol
[09:00:50] <shoky> xckpd7: forward declaration..?
[09:00:53] <xec> xckpd7: "declare"?
[09:01:41] * xec highfives shoky
[09:01:53] * shoky backrubs xec
[09:01:55] <shoky> ..
[09:02:11] <Ste_uk> xckpd7: apparently it used to be 'dim' but thats a bit archaic from what my colleague is saying
[09:02:29] <shoky> isn't that Basic
[09:02:36] <xec> that's just what i needed. *makes strange noises*
[09:02:45] <shoky> mmm strange noises
[09:02:59] <xec> dim stands for declare in memory if i'm not mistaken
[09:03:05] <shoky> strange scents tend to follow
[09:03:09] <khmer> it's unclear
[09:03:11] * xec farts
[09:03:14] <Ste_uk> shoky: probably yes considering he was a basic coder oncel ol
[09:03:15] <khmer> "declare in memory" makes a lot of sense
[09:03:15] <shoky> MMMMMM
[09:03:20] <khmer> but actually it seems to have meant "dimension"
[09:03:27] <khmer> just from the history i've read
[09:03:30] <shoky> ^^
[09:03:32] <shoky> me2
[09:03:47] <Ste_uk> khmer: hence dim?... thats what my colleague said anyway
[09:04:55] <khmer> Ste_uk: "dimension" seems to be what it originally meant, back in the early days when the first team of 12-year-old bhutanese shamanic coders were locked in an airless room with a leaking propane tank and told to write something called visual basic
[09:04:59] <xec> wikipedia just says Dim: "A keyword that declares a variable or array, in most versions of BASIC" -- so i guess declare is right but what it stands for is unclear
[09:05:27] <Ste_uk> looool
[09:05:30] <Ste_uk> ;)
[09:05:37] <shoky> Dim originally (in BASIC) stood for Dimension, as it was used to define the dimensions of an array.
[09:05:41] <Ste_uk> oh well... back to work :(
[09:06:01] <xec> as in, declaring a variable is what i think xckpd7 was after
[09:06:05] <luca78> hi
[09:06:10] <shoky> no idea what he was after
[09:06:17] <shoky> helo
[09:06:25] <xec> EHLO
[09:06:26] <khmer> boomer
[09:06:39] <luca78> i'm new, from italy..can i ask your help?
[09:06:45] <xec> ?ask @ luca78
[09:06:45] <bot-t1> luca78, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:06:45] <shoky> certainly
[09:06:58] <shoky> prego
[09:07:06] <luca78> grazie :)
[09:07:10] <shoky> ;]
[09:07:18] <luca78> can i talk in italian?
[09:07:28] <shoky> better not ;p
[09:07:32] <luca78> ok
[09:07:47] <xec> if you're italian i bet you can. i would be able to as well if i was italian
[09:08:03] <shoky> ;-]
[09:08:09] <xec> unfortunately, if you want help with something you should keep it in english ;)
[09:08:17] <luca78> i use jquery jcarousel and i've some problems
[09:08:36] <luca78> can i show you the website?
[09:08:41] <xec> please do
[09:09:06] <luca78> http://tappezzeriaguidi.it/prodotti.php?cat=Divani
[09:09:48] <luca78> why next and prev buttons dont work? i've done some modify and now don't work.. and i lose old versione :(
[09:10:21] <shoky> heh
[09:10:42] <Z_> hi
[09:11:02] <Z_> who knows Jquery UI autocompletion ?
[09:11:12] <xec> ?ask @ Z_
[09:11:13] <bot-t1> Z_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:11:35] <Z_> I'd like to use it with class
[09:11:47] <Z_> it seems to work only with id
[09:12:06] <luca78> i must wait for something?
[09:12:08] <Z_> it there a way to do that with class ?
[09:12:24] <shoky> luca yes wait
[09:12:28] <Z_> (because I use several fields in the form to autocomplete)
[09:13:44] <luca78> ok i wait..i can also pay if someone help me whit this jquery problems
[09:14:06] <zoned> i've got a problem i'm trying to solve where i essentially need to store boolean logic/a formula inside a database. but it seems the only way to then use this is to essentially eval() it in JS, which i don't want to do. how do people achieve things like storing a math equation in a database?
[09:14:14] <tomasm-> hi, is there perhaps any way to know whether a user has a browser window as the active window compared to an open window/tab they've minimized or neglected? i have ajax running at a 60 second interval to 'ping' the server to say a user is online and I am wanting to refine it to timeout when they leave a window open for hours but have neglected it...
[09:14:38] <tomasm-> maybe have a timeout that cancels the ping interval unless they have mouse or keyboard movement on the window?
[09:15:06] <demetan> can I put some  code in the header after an event ?
[09:15:22] <axl_> hey guys, I am a ruby developer hacking some JQuery because the person who works on it is not around
[09:15:34] <xec> demetan: do you mean <head> or <header> or http header?
[09:15:53] <xckpd7> Ste_uk: I figured out what I was looking for
[09:15:55] <axl_> i am trying to create a state select box for United States. Can i use a library ?
[09:16:03] <xec> luca78: i made you a demo to debug easier http://jsfiddle.net/aZEZ4/ copypasted your code
[09:16:07] <axl_> my current script is here: https://gist.github.com/ce948e4d1922925bbe33
[09:16:14] <WeThePeople> how do I click on a banner using code
[09:16:28] <demetan> xec: between <head></head>
[09:16:30] <zoned> WeThePeople, i just told you over in ##javascript
[09:16:36] <zoned> $("#banner").click();
[09:16:46] <xec> demetan: then yes
[09:17:12] <xec> zoned: i don't think that will work unless there is a click handler attached
[09:17:21] <xckpd7> Ste_uk: hoisting (I don't think I had it entirely correct but that's what I was thinking of)
[09:17:31] <demetan> how please ? in a specific piece of <head></head>
[09:17:47] <zoned> right, because if there's not a click handler attached.... what are you going to achieve by clicking? lol
[09:17:59] <xec> xckpd7: ahh.. yes. hoisting happens when you *dont* declare vars first :D
[09:18:17] <xckpd7> xec: haha
[09:18:30] <xec> zoned: maybe it's wrapped in an <a> element?
[09:19:24] <xec> zoned: my point was that .click() isn't the same as a mouse click
[09:19:30] <WeThePeople> zoned, where would i learn the rest of the code to put in my webpage. would it open a <script etc..
[09:19:34] <IconicSchema> Whats the best way to get a jquery object from HTMLLabelElement?
[09:19:39] <WeThePeople> open as
[09:19:54] <ajpiano> IconicSchema: $( elem )
[09:19:55] <shoky> we should have managed to come up with 'hoisting' in any case. shame on us
[09:20:58] <zoned> xec, i understand. WeThePeople what exactly are you trying to achieve?
[09:22:04] <WeThePeople> zoned, a 'instant' redirect from the banner ad, to the banner ad advertised website
[09:22:25] <zoned> when you say instant you mean as soon as the page loads?
[09:22:33] <WeThePeople> zoned, yes
[09:23:01] <zoned> WeThePeople, just set up a redirect. this is better done on the server, but can be done in JS if you have to.
[09:23:59] <WeThePeople> zoned, it has to be done in js or jq, i have to simulate a mouse click on the banner
[09:24:35] <WeThePeople> zoned, i think you are right with the code you supplied
[09:24:38] <IconicSchema> why would "label = $(e.srcElement.labels[0]);" throw an "invalid left-hand side in assignment"
[09:26:01] <zoned> WeThePeople, http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascriptredirect.php
[09:28:13] <WeThePeople> zoned, that wont work, thx though
[09:28:38] <granden> http://pastebin.com/sUj64iHK - That why wont it list anything? My test.php file looks like this, http://pastebin.com/dRPC34jZ
[09:32:43] <demetan> can I do this : $('head').append('file.js'); ?
[09:36:25] <Bauer> Guys, I have this command: $('#promoCodeForm').submit(); but it does not do a submission - any idea why? its supposed to work the same as the normal button users click to submit, right?
[09:36:38] <mbrevda> is there a .hover() equivalence for click event? (i.e. take two functions and run one or the other on a click)
[09:37:22] <gnarf> ?getScript @demetan
[09:37:23] <bot-t1> demetan, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:38:43] <granden> Anyone woh know why my script fails?
[09:38:46] <demetan> thank's
[09:39:18] <shoky> luca78 is gone :\
[09:39:35] <shoky> he hacked the carousel's css pretty bad i think
[09:39:44] <Bauer> the form element looks like this: <form action="/index.php?id=CHECKOUT_SCREEN&amp;NAME_PATH=Bundle_Bezeq&amp;SCREEN=CHECKOUT_SCREEN&amp;PHPSESSID=19975e4d68d09cf3e3fb34a14abe1100" method="post" id="PromoCodeForm" _lpchecked="1">
[09:39:51] <Bauer> so why $('#promoCodeForm').submit(); not working?
[09:40:44] <shoky> granden your pastes are dead
[09:41:48] <zoned> WeThePeople, all you can do is write a function that will execute when the banner is clicked. Then, simulate a click (essentially call that function you wrote) by saying banner.click(); however, if you're trying to programmatically cheat adwords' pay per click idea or something, i don't think this will work.
[09:41:57] <NoiseEee> Bauer: promoCodeForm / PromoCodeForm
[09:42:42] <WeThePeople> zoned, its not adwords
[09:42:48] <Bauer> NoiseEee: hmmmm, WTF.. why then when I run $('#promoCodeForm').submit(); from consle in Chrome, it returns the selected element? :S it should have returned empty set
[09:42:57] <MysterOnyx> When I change the text of an html input, it signals a javascript function that is supposed to change the visible text of an html select box to 'custom'. The following code does not work: $("#selectMealType").prop("text", 'custom'); ... does anyone know the correct way to do this?
[09:43:39] <Bauer> thanks NoiseEee! it works :) Still the question above is very interesting
[09:43:41] <Bauer> chrome bug?
[09:43:50] <zoned> WeThePeople, i didnt mean specifically adwords, but something like it. hence "or something"
[09:44:15] <NoiseEee> Bauer: $('#doesntExist') will certainly return a jquery object; whether its populated is what to inquire about
[09:44:37] <WeThePeople> zoned, its a banner ad from cj.com the company didnt supply a affiliate link.
[09:45:05] <WeThePeople> zoned, it does not work like adwords, it only upon a sale of the product
[09:45:18] <Bauer> NoiseEee: well the jquery object returned is the Form element, so I assumed the selector is correct
[09:45:45] <granden> shoky: Woops, here they come then, http://pastebin.com/pRYCTfNj and http://pastebin.com/vAeDeyez
[09:45:59] <Bauer> NoiseEee: it does not return like empty brackets [], but exactly the whole element
[09:46:38] <WeThePeople> zoned, what about a .trigger event?
[09:50:27] <aNewBee> Hello. I have a question. May one use the css function to edit just a portion of text (i.e. a slice) in a DOM element or does it need to apply to the entire element?
[09:52:28] <TimothyA> anyone here knows of a good datepicker for jquery?
[09:55:17] <Morbus> hey all. I'm a JS and jQ newb, but I think i'm in some race condition, perhaps, with $.getJSON.
[09:55:28] <Morbus> the relevant 15 lines of code I have are here: http://pastebin.com/EazKEEBP
[09:55:29] <zoned> TimothyA, look at jqueryUI
[09:55:33] <Morbus> along with inline comments explaining my problem.
[09:56:25] <Morbus> i don't understand why i can see the "right" HTML when I print out the full object, but I can't seem to access it directly.
[09:57:38] <shoky> granden: i dont really know php but it seems like you're outputting more than one JSON object. (several JSON arrays)
[09:58:06] <granden> Ok, perhaps have to build the array first, then output it.
[09:58:10] <shoky> granden: figure out what your php is outputting
[09:58:21] <granden> hmm
[09:58:37] <shoky> (just go to the url)
[10:00:49] <granden> shoky: http://pastebin.com/hxiwt85x
[10:00:56] <granden> that is what my code is outputting
[10:01:28] <granden> right no only outputting 1 item
[10:01:32] <granden> will be like 5-6 later
[10:01:49] <shoky> mm seems legit
[10:02:27] <shoky> what do you get when you console.log(article)
[10:03:09] <aNewBee> Does anybody know how to place a border around a particular text string if it is found in the document?
[10:03:16] <granden> shoky: Where should I put that code?
[10:03:35] <shoky> granden: first line in news function
[10:03:40] <granden> oke
[10:04:00] <shoky> and check your firebug/chrome/whatever console
[10:04:07] <granden> using opera
[10:04:21] <shoky> know your way around it/
[10:04:22] <shoky> ?
[10:04:24] <shoky> (i dont)
[10:04:37] <shoky> or just alert that suckah
[10:05:15] <granden> shoky: Not that much
[10:05:20] <granden> Got chrome as well
[10:05:26] <granden> but dont know that really well either
[10:05:43] <shoky> ctrl-shift-j will get you to the console
[10:05:45] <Qix> Can anyone shed some light on my animation-queue-hell? http://bit.ly/ILARwt
[10:05:49] <granden> shoky: Ok, thanks
[10:06:35] <granden> shoky: Not on osx :)

[10:08:49] <granden> it says in my console then
[10:08:54] <shoky> ah
[10:08:58] <johnkpaul> granden:you're missing www
[10:09:04] <johnkpaul> they are different domains
[10:09:05] <Morbus> hrm.
[10:09:19] <ajpiano> Morbus: if you are diong a $.each you don't have to do foo[key]
[10:09:21] <Morbus> how do you use the success callback of getJSON? mine doesn't seem to be firing, even though I know the JSON is finished parseing.
[10:09:26] <ajpiano> you have foo[key] sitting right there as value
[10:09:44] <granden> johnkpaul: and shoky Thanks!
[10:09:45] <ajpiano> Morbus: are you sure your json is valid
[10:09:54] <ajpiano> the success callback of getJSON doesn't fire if the json is not valid
[10:09:55] <Morbus> ajpiano: i had tried it without, but was concerned that the global wasn't being sucked into value.
[10:10:02] <jstout24> I'm trying to create a JS api to give clients to register users on our system‚Ä¶ how can I correctly do a POST from clientsite.com -> mysite.com/api if clientsite.com was to include mysite.com/api.js
[10:10:11] <Morbus> ajpiano: well, the JSON is parsed "correctly", at least - i'm getting the data I expect to get.
[10:10:31] <ajpiano> Morbus: it's hard to tell from a static paste, a functioning demo on jsfiddle or jsbin would help a lot
[10:10:32] <shoky> granden see ?dtj
[10:10:34] <bot-t1> shoky, Couldn't find "dtj" in jQuery Docs.

[10:10:43] <shoky> oh
[10:10:47] <shoky> thx ;)
[10:11:01] <Morbus> ajpiano: sadly, this is inside google maps, so it's hard to jsfiddle. i can upload my current stuff though on a domain, if you'd like.
[10:11:13] <ajpiano> not the google maps part
[10:11:27] <ajpiano> but i guess that's fine if it's easier than ripping it out
[10:11:30] <ajpiano> to create a fiddle
[10:13:38] <Morbus> ajpiano: it's not hugely convoluted at the moment, i'll get it up.
[10:13:59] <ajpiano> Morbus: all you need to do to demonstrate the issue is just see the section on "testing ajax" on the side of jsfiddle
[10:14:05] <ajpiano> and use your JSON as the mock response
[10:14:36] <Whirl3d> You know how some methods break the jquery chain and return an object literal or string or something? Inside the plugin definition, how does it address the notion that "this" _is_ the jquery object. var elem=$(this[0])?
[10:14:38] <Morbus> ajpiano: i'm a newb at JS, much less jsfiddle. while i'm waiting for this to upload, i'll fiddle with fiddle.
[10:15:00] <granden> shoky and johnkpaul Later on, when I have done developing this it wont be run on the same server/domain.
[10:15:14] <granden> so then the domains will be missmatching
[10:15:19] <granden> How would I solve that?

[10:17:05] <shoky> ajpiano++
[10:18:12] <granden> Ok, now I got a problem then.
[10:18:28] <granden> :)
[10:19:16] <smplstk> granden: you can create an ugly proxy, if you must
[10:19:26] <granden> Thought of using phonegap to have this as a simple ios app and loading news from my website into the app.
[10:19:31] <smplstk> by reading a remote page, caching it on your server, and then working with the data there
[10:19:52] <smplstk> using a server side technology.
[10:20:25] <shoky> isn't JSONP currently also a solution?
[10:20:34] <granden> I was thinking of doing something like, serverside: json export of the database data.
[10:20:43] <smplstk> sure, if there's an api serving up the content with JSONP
[10:20:45] <granden> and clientside (iOS App): reading json data and handle it.
[10:21:08] <shoky> ah
[10:21:56] <smplstk> JSONP is always the best way to do that stuff, and creating a JSON API with something like PHP is relatively straight forward.
[10:22:22] <granden> smplstk: Ok. I guess thats what I got to do then.
[10:22:36] <smplstk> granden: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[10:23:06] <granden> smplstk: What about json encode?
[10:23:35] <smplstk> just sayin' that's what you would use to take serverside PHP data and serve it up as JSON
[10:25:08] <granden> smplstk: Yeah, thats what is what I do
[10:25:17] <shoky> :D
[10:25:59] <granden> smplstk: http://pastebin.com/pRYCTfNj
[10:26:02] <granden> Thats how I do it.
[10:26:22] <granden> How would I do a JSONP API out of that. So I could read it with jquery on the client side?
[10:26:51] <smplstk> just make the jsonp call, do you have that url live somewhere?
[10:27:25] <granden> smplstk: http://europeantrophy.com/test.php
[10:28:02] <johnkpaul> echo $_GET["callback"].'('.json_encode($obj).')';
[10:28:05] <johnkpaul> @granden
[10:28:28] <johnkpaul> OH NO I mean echo $_GET["callback"].'('.json_encode($obj).');';
[10:28:36] <granden> uhm?
[10:28:38] <johnkpaul> sorry about that, missed a semicolon
[10:28:40] <granden> not following
[10:28:41] <Morbus> ajpiano: sorry for the delay.
[10:28:47] <Morbus> ajpiano: http://www.disobey.com/detergent/2012/maps-of-golarion/ is the demo.
[10:28:58] <johnkpaul> granden: that is how jsonp would work
[10:28:59] <Morbus> ajpiano: http://www.disobey.com/detergent/2012/maps-of-golarion/js/google-maps.js is the JS - search for "console.log" for the problem area.
[10:29:09] <Morbus> ajpiano: and http://www.disobey.com/detergent/2012/maps-of-golarion/js/inner-sea-regions.json is the JSON.
[10:29:17] <johnkpaul> don't echo in a while loop, store what you want to be sent in some variable, and at the end, add what I sent you
[10:29:41] <ajpiano> Morbus: uhhm
[10:29:55] <granden> johnkpaul: ok. thats how I do now but only echo json_encode();
[10:29:56] <ajpiano> are you expecting loadMarkers to magically be done loading
[10:30:02] <johnkpaul> jsonp requires that your server respect the jsonp convention, which is that the get paramter "callback" will be used as the function that will be called
[10:30:02] <ajpiano> before those console logs start?
[10:30:13] <Morbus> ajpiano: well, that's what I was wondering with my initial question, which you might have missed.
[10:30:23] <ajpiano> ah
[10:30:23] <ajpiano> yea
[10:30:33] <Morbus> ajpiano: it *feels* like a race.
[10:30:34] <ajpiano> ajax is asynchronous, regardless of how many functions you wrap around it
[10:30:53] <Morbus> ajpiano: i'm just confused why printing out the global at all, inside that each(), is showing the "right" data.
[10:31:08] <granden> johnkpaul: Changed my echo json_encode($data); to $_GET["callback"].'('.json_encode($data).');';
[10:31:17] <granden> thats what you meant?
[10:31:17] <shoky> ;s
[10:31:30] <shoky> doubts
[10:31:40] <granden> dont really get it then.
[10:31:45] <johnkpaul> granden: yes, generally, it can't be in the while loop though
[10:31:45] <ajpiano> Morbus: hard to say, ... it looks like *some* of the loadMarkers fn is sync but others aren't
[10:31:50] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp
[10:31:52] <bot-t1> johnkpaul, What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[10:31:56] <johnkpaul> @ granden
[10:32:27] <Morbus> ajpiano: can i pass custom parameters to the getJSON success callback? my next guess is to do the innerHTML tweak in there, but I need the type that's passed to loadMarkers to do that.
[10:32:53] <ajpiano> you can make loadMarkers actaully accept a callback
[10:33:38] <ajpiano> loadMarkers(type, url, cb) {  $.getJSON(url, function(data) /* do other processing */ cb && cb()  }
[10:33:39] <Morbus> as a newb, i'm not entirely sure what that means.
[10:33:54] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm
[10:34:06] <ajpiano> Morbus: a callback is nothing more than a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and the "another function" then executes the callback at the right time
[10:34:15] <Morbus> ajpiano: how would that help? wouldn't the cb() fire even if getJSON was still working? why would I do a cb on lM and not getJSON?
[10:34:33] <smplstk> granden: your page is erroring out now: http://europeantrophy.com/test.php
[10:34:37] <ajpiano> Morbus: cause you can call it *inside* the $.getJSON callback... once it's done
[10:34:47] <Morbus> ajpiano: ah!
[10:34:58] <Morbus> ajpiano: wait, couldn't i just move the innerHTML tweak to after the $.each in the JSON?
[10:34:59] <granden> smplstk: How about now?
[10:35:04] <Morbus> ajpiano: wouldn't that be pretty muh the same thing?
[10:35:14] <smplstk> there are still errors.
[10:35:18] <ajpiano> yes
[10:35:20] <smplstk> ^^ granden
[10:35:33] <granden> hmm
[10:35:33] <Morbus> ajpiano: i'll try that, thanks!

[10:36:29] <ctwiz> Is there any reason, why a click event might fire once, but the $.ajax call inside of it will send twice, then report only one 'success:' when I put a console.log() in there?

[10:37:11] <granden> might be bissing something
[10:37:35] <smplstk> still broken
[10:37:36] <johnkpaul> you just need to guard against no callback parameter
[10:38:51] <smplstk> granden: I think it was fine when you had echo json_encode( $data );
[10:38:53] <Morbus> ajpiano: man, an hour of wtf just to move one line from one function to another, and it's all magical now.
[10:38:54] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm, would a simple if statement be enough or would I acctually need anything else?
[10:38:58] <Morbus> ajpiano: thanks for the sanity check.
[10:39:04] <ajpiano> welx
[10:39:32] <johnkpaul> if(isset($_GET["callback"]))
[10:39:35] <johnkpaul> @granden
[10:39:39] <johnkpaul> it might be is_set
[10:39:51] <smplstk> nope, it's isset
[10:40:03] <smplstk> you don't really need that either
[10:40:24] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[10:40:24] <smplstk> unless you _ONLY_ want javascript to be able to scrape the data
[10:40:36] <johnkpaul> yeah, it depends on how much you care, granden
[10:40:55] <ctwiz> anyone have any insight: $.ajax is getting called twice, when the click event is only getting called once, according to console.log();
[10:40:57] <smplstk> alls I know is http://europeantrophy.com/test.php is still broak
[10:41:20] <granden> smplstk: Yeah havent done anything
[10:41:25] <johnkpaul> smplstk: it's a notice
[10:41:28] <johnkpaul> not an error
[10:41:50] <xec_> ctwiz: that doesn'y make sense... maybe you have two click handlers doing an ajax call each?
[10:41:52] <johnkpaul> it's because callback isn't a valid property in the $_GET
[10:42:20] <xec_> ctwiz: maybe from including an old version of your script in addition to the new one, or something similar
[10:42:24] <granden> I'm a bit confused to be honest.
[10:43:06] <ctwiz> xec_: that's what I thought too. I'm using rails, so the scripts are handled by it. it certainly sounds like a duplicate function is getting called.
[10:43:21] <ctwiz> the urls are the same. I'll go through the scripts.
[10:43:21] <johnkpaul> granden: that's ok, that's what we're here for. what's the question?
[10:44:20] <granden> johnkpaul: If I do like you said, with the $_GET["callback"]
[10:44:37] <granden> and I set a callback variable when calling that
[10:44:57] <granden> then it als√• adds the callback name to the begining of the json-output
[10:45:01] <granden> also*
[10:45:03] <johnkpaul> yes, that's correct
[10:45:09] <johnkpaul> the original issue here was an ajax call that you needed to be xdomain right?
[10:45:16] <granden> yes
[10:45:26] <granden> if xdomains means being called from another domain.
[10:45:33] <johnkpaul> yes, sorry x == cross
[10:45:37] <johnkpaul> so you have an ajax call that works now, on a single domain
[10:45:39] <granden> ah :)
[10:46:10] <johnkpaul> so now you can change the dataType to "jsonp" and then your code, in the ideal situation, would just work(tm)
[10:46:26] <johnkpaul> because jquery understands jsonp, and will add a callback=? parameter automatically
[10:46:37] <johnkpaul> and it will do all of the grunt work, and you'll just have your successcallback
[10:46:42] <johnkpaul> as if it was on the same domain
[10:46:48] <granden> ok
[10:47:15] <granden> $.getJSONP then insted of $.getJSON?
[10:47:19] <smplstk> I was writting a fiddle to work with your data granden, but the page is still broak >:|
[10:47:32] <smplstk> $.getJSON
[10:47:44] <granden> smplstk: But it aint brook, just needs a callback= parameter in the get field
[10:47:52] <smplstk> ...
[10:47:59] <smplstk> IT IS BROKEN, friend.
[10:48:06] <granden> smplstk: thats what johnkpaul said :)
[10:48:10] <smplstk> <br /><b>Notice</b>:  Undefined index: callback in <b>/home/europeantrophy/htdocs/test.php</b> on line <b>26</b><br />

[10:48:31] <smplstk> test2.php === 404
[10:48:51] <smplstk> ?csb
[10:48:52] <bot-t1> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[10:48:58] <granden> try now
[10:49:31] <johnkpaul> sorry for the confusion smplstk and granden, I thought the goal here was to get the ajax call working cross domains, and were in the process of implementing jsonp
[10:49:42] <granden> johnkpaul: Yes it is
[10:49:54] <smplstk> do you need to do anything on the PHP side to do that though?
[10:49:56] <granden> This is what confusing me.
[10:50:07] <johnkpaul> yes, smplstk, the php needs to handle the callback parameter
[10:50:33] <smplstk> granden: try using application/javascript as the application type for test2.php
[10:50:41] <smplstk> pretty plz
[10:50:46] <granden> :)
[10:50:59] <granden> smplstk: done
[10:51:44] <granden> johnkpaul: But I got that callback thing in the php file you talked about.
[10:51:52] <smplstk> OH SNAP
[10:52:01] <smplstk> johnkpaul is rite
[10:52:02] <smplstk> echo $_GET['callback'] . '('.json_encode($data).')';
[10:52:17] <granden> smplstk: Thats what I got in test.php :)
[10:53:09] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:53:15] <johnkpaul> granden: your test.php is done
[10:53:17] <johnkpaul> and works fine
[10:53:21] <johnkpaul> can you show your javascript code
[10:53:24] <johnkpaul> your .getJSON
[10:53:32] <johnkpaul> you don't need to change it to getJSONP
[10:53:40] <johnkpaul> you need to add ?callback=? in your url
[10:53:49] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:53:54] <johnkpaul> read the paragraph about jsonp
[10:54:02] <smplstk> it still messes up though
[10:54:17] <smplstk> because it's echoing ?( at the start of the doc...
[10:54:28] <johnkpaul> oh, then that's a typo
[10:54:58] <granden> echo $_GET["callback"].'('.json_encode($data).');';
[10:55:01] <granden> that is how it is now
[10:55:08] <granden> should I change it anyway to remove that?
[10:55:10] <johnkpaul> granden: can you jsfiddle your javascript
[10:55:12] <johnkpaul> no, keep that
[10:55:20] <granden> johnkpaul: ok will do
[10:55:51] <shoky> can you make me lunch
[10:55:51] <adac> hi guys! can someone tell me how to replace some random text in a div completely with some new text?
[10:55:54] <shoky> PLz
[10:55:56] <smplstk> the problem is with the json itself dudes
[10:56:02] <smplstk> not the javascript
[10:56:10] <smplstk> what's being outputting is not valid json.
[10:56:16] <smplstk> *outputted*
[10:56:16] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm
[10:56:34] <shoky> adac: $('#theDivId').html('blah')
[10:56:37] <shoky> or .text()
[10:56:37] <johnkpaul> oh I see smplstk, also different problem
[10:57:00] <granden> What am I doing wrong?
[10:57:53] <adac> shoky, thank you a lot. I soon make dinner, if you like you be invited ;)
[10:58:54] <shoky> :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[10:58:57] <shoky> thank you so much.
[10:58:59] <smplstk> granden: I just sent you a message via query
[10:59:30] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/NRMEu/#update
[10:59:47] <granden> I belive I did it right, never used jsfiddle before
[11:00:34] <granden> johnkpaul !
[11:00:48] <johnkpaul> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/NRMEu/1/
[11:00:50] <johnkpaul> works fine
[11:02:08] <shoky> hmm what's that question mark at the end of the url?
[11:02:16] <shoky> (sorry, wasn't following the discussion)
[11:02:27] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm, trying to run that on jsfiddle
[11:02:32] <granden> but the result box is just empty
[11:02:38] <johnkpaul> look in your console
[11:03:14] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp @shoky
[11:03:15] <bot-t1> shoky, What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[11:03:50] <granden> johnkpaul: Ah
[11:04:13] <granden> johnkpaul: So I only need to change my url like yours
[11:04:16] <granden> and it would work?
[11:04:22] <johnkpaul> ?tias
[11:04:23] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[11:04:33] <shoky> johnkpaul where is that explained?
[11:04:44] <johnkpaul> shoky: what do you mean?
[11:04:44] <rns> anyone know why this simple .change function isn't triggering the alert? http://jsfiddle.net/WebMd/
[11:04:59] <shoky> umm. the callback name is '?'  ?
[11:05:14] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to find out what tr of a table has a certain column by index with out iterating through al of them?
[11:05:32] <shoky> what do you mean 'a certain column' ?
[11:05:33] <granden> johnkpaul: Hmm did not work
[11:05:38] <granden> clea
[11:05:40] <granden> woops
[11:05:42] <granden> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[11:05:44] <granden> I get that
[11:05:45] <IconicSchema> rns: your event is on #report... and your html is a class
[11:05:53] <jeffsmykil> i have six columns
[11:05:58] <granden> in my console
[11:06:04] <jeffsmykil> one has a class of foo I want to know what number column it is
[11:06:05] <shoky> oh a certain column by index, i see
[11:06:08] <IconicSchema> rns: http://jsfiddle.net/kwilliams_texstarweb/hZpKw/1/
[11:06:09] <shoky> sry
[11:06:20] <jeffsmykil> shoky right now im using a for loop
[11:06:34] <rns> IconicSchema, awesome, thanks!
[11:06:39] <johnkpaul> shoky: that's in the getjson docs
[11:06:39] <smplstk> granden: it works with that second one I got you to set up: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/qNjJc/
[11:06:41] <johnkpaul> ?getjson
[11:06:42] <bot-t1> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[11:06:47] <rns> IconicSchema, when do I use # instead "." ?
[11:07:08] <IconicSchema> when you use and id instead of a class
[11:07:19] <IconicSchema> id's should be unique where classes are re-usable
[11:07:21] <johnkpaul> granden: can you show your jsfiddle?
[11:07:30] <johnkpaul> granden: are you sure you selected jquery on the left side
[11:07:56] <smplstk> johnkpaul: the fiddle I just pasted works fine off his server
[11:08:00] <merlin1991> johnkpaul: there is no such thing as getsjonp
[11:08:06] <granden> johnkpaul: I did run it on my server not on jsfiddle.
[11:08:07] <smplstk> there's something bust with the data that's getting returned from the DB, OR SOMETHING?
[11:08:13] <shoky> jeffsmykil: maybe see ?.index
[11:08:13] <bot-t1> jeffsmykil, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[11:08:20] <merlin1991> ah sry, read the old thingy
[11:08:23] <smplstk> the non DB test2.php works fine.
[11:08:37] <smplstk> (which can be seen in my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/qNjJc/)
[11:08:41] <granden> yeah
[11:09:05] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know, they both work for me
[11:09:15] <johnkpaul> both with and without the '2' in the url
[11:09:27] <smplstk> oh ya
[11:09:30] <smplstk> SO THEY DO
[11:09:37] <smplstk> trolololo
[11:09:39] <smplstk> http://jsfiddle.net/serio/qNjJc/8/
[11:09:40] <granden> so its only me its not working for :)
[11:09:53] <smplstk> granden: it's your fiddle, probs
[11:10:08] <shoky> johnkpaul: ah cool. thx
[11:10:22] <diago> How can I know if a dialog has been created on an element already?
[11:11:13] <granden> smplstk: But I run this on the server
[11:11:22] <granden> smplstk: I copied your last fiddle
[11:11:34] <granden> and put it in my json_testing.html file
[11:12:18] <granden> http://europeantrophy.com/json_testing.html
[11:12:20] <granden> like that
[11:12:32] <smplstk> alls I know is what the fiddle tells me: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/qNjJc/
[11:13:08] <smplstk> lol granden
[11:13:11] <smplstk> your HTML is broak
[11:13:17] <smplstk> wtf is: √¢‚Ç¨‚Äπ
[11:13:30] <smplstk> UTF8 FAIL
[11:13:52] <granden> it should not be UTF8
[11:14:04] <smplstk> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:14:17] <smplstk> you have garbage chars in your html doc, is what I'm sayin'
[11:16:00] <granden> smplstk: Dont see them in my text-editor
[11:16:05] <granden> but I get what you are saying
[11:16:33] <smplstk> it's your text editor that's making them...
[11:16:46] <granden> using Coda.app
[11:16:52] <granden> never had this problem before with it.
[11:17:08] <smplstk> granden: it's working now
[11:17:13] <jeffsmykil> does anyone use tablesorter?
[11:18:27] <granden> thanks
[11:18:34] <granden> and this does work xdomain ?
[11:18:39] <granden> stupid question
[11:18:42] <granden> worked on jsfiddle haha
[11:18:50] <jstout24> i'm dynamically adding a javascript file which is only `var response = { ‚Ä¶ some object data ‚Ä¶ }`.. how can i get `response` as soon as it's available? (ie. as soon as the script was appended and loaded)
[11:19:24] <shoky> johnkpaul: jquery changes the '?' to its own random callback name?
[11:19:42] <granden> johnkpaul: You seamed to know a bit of php as well, on the php side. If I want to have a different function returning other data
[11:19:46] <granden> how do I set that up?
[11:20:00] <smplstk> jeffsmykil: wikipedia uses tablesorter :)
[11:20:00] <granden> like callback=news would return what it does now
[11:20:09] <granden> and callback=teams would return teams?
[11:20:18] <granden> as I would build up in a $team variable
[11:20:45] <johnkpaul> shoky: yes
[11:20:54] <johnkpaul> granden: have to work on something else, but I'll be back if no one else helps
[11:20:55] <kapo7789> ?callback=teams, and in php you do $_GET['callback'] to get the stuff after callback
[11:20:57] <bot-t1> kapo7789, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[11:20:58] <johnkpaul> also, you can check out ##php
[11:21:15] <shoky> granden: i think maybe another GET param is also a good option
[11:21:15] <jeffsmykil> smpltsk is there a way to get it to report which column is being sorted and how?
[11:21:44] <shoky> because having ?callback=teams  would get cached
[11:22:05] <shoky> actually maybe not cause there's another _ param
[11:22:07] <shoky> duno.
[11:22:07] <granden> shoky: Ok, whats your suggestion?
[11:22:16] <shoky> add another GET param
[11:22:56] <shoky> url.php?param=teams&callback=?
[11:22:59] <shoky> i guess
[11:23:24] <granden> shoky: ok
[11:24:20] <granden> I thought of doing something in the php like
[11:24:37] <granden> if($_GET["callback"]=="news") it would return what it returns now
[11:24:40] <granden> and such
[11:24:47] <granden> and one if statement for temas etc
[11:24:47] <shoky> yeah that'd probably work too
[11:25:00] <shoky> i just suggested doing checking $_GET["param"] for that
[11:25:13] <shoky> still using $_GET["callback"] as the callback name
[11:25:32] <granden> ok
[11:25:43] <granden> does it mather what the callback is named?
[11:26:01] <shoky> i think maybe just for caching purposes, but i really dont know
[11:27:15] <granden> I will be busy for a while now, trying to do something acctually not just asking for help :)
[11:27:24] <granden> thank you all for the help
[11:27:30] <shoky> ;]
[11:27:41] <granden> And a special thanks to shoky smplstk and johnkpaul-afk
[11:27:41] <billygalbreath> shoky: do you ever sleep?
[11:27:57] <shoky> billygalbreath: i slept over 12 hours
[11:28:27] <shoky> and so i ditched work for today
[11:28:34] <billygalbreath> lol
[11:28:36] <shoky> and so i am here
[11:28:38] <shoky> ;)
[11:29:10] <jholloman> Is there a safe way to reorder bound events on an element? I'm working in an enterprise environment and there are a few window resize events bound that I would like to add an event before. I'm assuming it is unsafe to manually reorder the $(window).data( "events" ).resize array
[11:29:58] <shoky> good question
[11:30:36] <billygalbreath> i would try it, and if nothing blows up i'd deem it safe enough.
[11:30:45] <shoky> great answer ;)
[11:30:51] <jholloman> haha
[11:31:09] <shoky> do report, if you make it ;)
[11:31:24] <jholloman> might make for a good plugin project
[11:31:30] <shoky> indeed
[11:33:11] <Arkangel> hello, can somebody help me out here with jquery - countdown plugin?
[11:34:18] <shoky> ?ask
[11:34:18] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:34:41] <billygalbreath> and use jsfiddle.net if you can to show us whats going on
[11:36:41] <Arkangel> Well, i'm trying to add code from a jquery countdown plugin that i found.  i have put the includes in my html pages
[11:36:56] <shoky> ;S
[11:36:56] <Arkangel> and i put the code in my body of my index
[11:37:05] <shoky> jsfiddle it plese
[11:37:06] <shoky> please
[11:37:24] <gustonegro> hello, is there a way to add a tab to a set of jquery ui tabs, but without knowing the id of the tab element?  In other words, I want to create my tab in memory using creatElement and then add it.
[11:37:46] <Arkangel> ok shoky
[11:40:36] <rns> anyone know why this isn't sending the selected value to the alert dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/WebMd/1/
[11:41:53] <shoky> rns: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/WebMd/2/
[11:42:39] <rns> shoky, is there any way to get the value of the selected option?
[11:42:41] <gustonegro> rns: looks like you forgot the "." on report
[11:43:02] <gustonegro> rns: shouldn't it be:   $(".reportViewSelect option:selected").text();
[11:43:08] <shoky> rns: .val()
[11:43:25] <Arkangel> shoky: please check on http://jsfiddle.net/d6fAb/1/
[11:43:59] <rns> shoky, gustonegro thanks guys
[11:44:31] <Arkangel> i found the countdown on : http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[11:44:40] <shoky> Arkangel: what is .datepick() ?
[11:45:22] <shoky> also that countdown js is incomplete or broken
[11:46:08] <Arkangel> ow... crap
[11:46:31] <Arkangel> any suggestions for another one?
[11:47:50] <rgr> with something like $("findme").append($("#movememaybe").detach()) will the detach happen if the initial $("findme") doesnt succeed?
[11:48:06] <zerobeholder> Looking to filter html divs based on whether there is a positive regex match to a text input value http://pastebin.com/pfbnXTYc
[11:48:09] <gnarf> rgr yes
[11:48:19] <gnarf> rgr: there is no reason for that .detach() tho
[11:48:33] <gnarf> its kinda implied when you .append something someplace that it is detached from its current position
[11:48:49] <rgr> whats the correct jquery code structure way to detach and reattach to an anchor only if that anchor exists?
[11:49:00] <rgr> gnarf: thanks
[11:49:22] <zerobeholder> If it matches I want to set display to block, if it doesn't I want display none; except if the value is '' then all divs have .css('display', 'block')
[11:49:30] <rgr> oh in that case I can just remove the detach call and it will just work since it implies the deatch IF the anchor is there
[11:49:33] <gnarf> rgr: im not sure but $( selector ).append( selector2 ) would prolly do that
[11:49:41] <rgr> snap. thanks
[11:50:39] <gnarf> ?filter @zerobeholder
[11:50:40] <bot-t1> zerobeholder, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:51:21] <gnarf> divs.hide().filter( function() { return regexp.exec( $(this).text() ); }).show();
[11:51:42] <fru> Hello room... please can somebody help me with my question about license... I planning create website theme and sell it on themeforest... can I use jquery for theme or it will be broke some license of jquery?
[11:51:51] <BarisW> When I want to search an element within an each loop, what is the best way? Does $(this).(':header').addClass('test'); work?
[11:52:01] <BarisW> Or do I need to use find()
[11:52:07] <gnarf> fru: if you include the source with its copyright, you're all good
[11:52:18] <zerobeholder> That was based on a stack overflow post that I kind of understood -- but did not. * sadness *
[11:52:37] <zerobeholder> however, gnarf that looks like something I want to play with...
[11:52:43] <gnarf> BarisW: well it looks like a "find" to me
[11:52:44] <zerobeholder> be back in a bit.
[11:52:54] <BarisW> gnarf: OK, thanks.
[11:53:09] <gnarf> BarisW: but you can also do that anyway
[11:53:14] <gnarf> like that doesn't need to be an each
[11:53:22] <gnarf> things like .find() are implicitly eached anyway
[11:53:37] <gnarf> and .addClass
[11:53:43] <gnarf> it operates on all the matches at once
[11:54:04] <BarisW> ok great, it works fine now! ;)
[11:55:02] <BarisW> Then one more question. When creating links with jQuery, how do I prevent that the browsers jumps to the top when clicking? I do this: $(this).html('<a href="#" class="close">' + $(this).text() + '</a>');
[11:55:33] <BarisW> I see other websites that use # in the link and when clicking, the browser don't scroll.
[11:55:45] <fru> gnafs: so in theme wich i planning sell need add in documentation information that in theme I use jquery element.. or you mean something other?... thank you for help
[11:55:47] <ericandrewlewis> BarisW: preventDefault() i believe
[11:56:09] <shoky> Arkangel: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gBrjd/
[11:56:21] <BarisW> ericandrewlewis: yes! Cool ;)
[11:56:25] <shoky> you named your div #noDiv instead of noDiv
[11:56:26] <BarisW> ericandrewlewis: thanks a lot
[11:56:29] <ericandrewlewis> ;)
[11:56:44] <shoky> Arkangel: and i linked to the js and css from the link you gave me
[11:57:17] <shoky> Arkangel: and of course called the correct .countdown() and not a made up .datepick() that has nothing to do with this plugin
[11:58:35] <BarisW> ericandrewlewis: bummer. Doesn't helpt. Prevents clicking, but not the scrolling of the browser
[11:58:39] <Arkangel> shoky: ok thanks im going to test it now
[11:59:16] <ericandrewlewis> BarisW: that's surprising. in my practice i usually just leave out the href attribute in my anchor tag, and then replicate the look of a link with css
[11:59:40] <BarisW> ericandrewlewis: that might work as well, good idea
[11:59:44] <BarisW> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1061580/jquery-click-on-anchor-element-forces-scroll-to-top
[12:00:05] <BarisW> ericandrewlewis: <a id="id_of_anchor" href="javascript:void(0)" /> might do the trick
[12:00:18] <ericandrewlewis> yeah, that sounds smart
[12:00:57] <FernandoBasso> I am using jquery-hashchange plugin, but I'm not getting 'back to top' buttons to work. Any ideas?
[12:01:39] <shoky> FernandoBasso: jsfiddle it
[12:03:28] <FernandoBasso> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/V5eGD/
[12:03:45] <shoky> proper jsfiddle please :\
[12:04:37] <FernandoBasso> I don't understand.
[12:04:45] <FernandoBasso> Do you want less code?
[12:05:02] <Arkangel> shoky: im being an idiot, im not getting it to work on a new webpage... :(
[12:05:14] <shoky> FernandoBasso: sec
[12:05:27] <shoky> Arkangel: did you see the .js and .css that i linked to?
[12:05:41] <shoky> Arkangel check 'Add Resources' on the left
[12:05:47] <Arkangel> shoky: ok ill check
[12:06:01] <shoky> jsfiddle should really make those more obvious
[12:06:13] <billygalbreath> i thought they _Were_ pretty obvious
[12:07:03] <billygalbreath> maybe flashy text from 1995 would help?
[12:07:03] <billygalbreath> lol
[12:07:57] <shoky> a noob who sees jsfiddle for the first time won't know to look in 'Add Resources' for linked files that he needs to put in his local page
[12:08:38] <Arkangel> shoky: lol i put those in my includes too but still not going good...
[12:08:46] <Jon47> i think the jsfiddle ux is pretty nice
[12:08:48] <billygalbreath> idk.. i never used jsfiddle before 2 days ago and i saw it right away
[12:08:52] <shoky> FernandoBasso: what i meant is: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/V5eGD/2/
[12:08:56] <shoky> which is a bit more proper
[12:09:06] <shoky> er
[12:09:08] <shoky> forgot jqeury
[12:09:19] <shoky> this then http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/V5eGD/3/
[12:10:28] <Arkangel> shoky: would you mind checking it on my blank webpage and look at source code what i put wrong? i probably just put the code wrong somewhere... :(
[12:10:42] <shoky> k
[12:11:31] <shoky> Jon47 i agree. just the external resources bothers me a bit, like now
[12:11:32] <Arkangel> shoky: http://www.ofshepherdsden.be/testpagina.html
[12:12:25] <shoky> extra     });
[12:12:54] <Arkangel> lol
[12:12:58] <Arkangel> it works now :D
[12:13:01] <shoky> ;D
[12:13:09] <Arkangel> im such an idiot lol
[12:13:18] <billygalbreath> yeah
[12:13:22] <FernandoBasso> Where, here's the link for the localhost server.
[12:13:27] <FernandoBasso> http://4kyd.localtunnel.com/BadSites/intro.html
[12:13:27] <disappearedng> let say the user has a tab opened, is there a way to have the browser switch focus to a particular tab?
[12:14:34] <Arkangel> shoky:  how come the counter looks more nice on jsFiddle then on the blank page
[12:15:16] <billygalbreath> Arkangel: your <styles> tag needs to be a <link> tag
[12:15:21] <Arkangel> shoky: nm i forgot the css part :D
[12:15:44] <FernandoBasso> In the js scipt, I only get anchors with a 'case' class. I can't understand why it is interfering with the plain 'back to top link'. (It is in the 'Capa | Topo' links).
[12:17:51] <Jon47> disappearedng: you can specify the target window for links with the target attribute‚Ä¶
[12:19:14] <FernandoBasso> If someone wants to take a look at the entire code: http://4kyd.localtunnel.com/BadSites.zip
[12:20:33] <Arkangel> shoky:  and billygalbreath  thx for helping me!
[12:21:23] <nVee> I am doing a simple $("selector").click(function() { console.log($(this).parent("tr").find("td:eq[0]").html() } but it returns null. There is definately text in that td, any suggestions?
[12:24:29] <kapo7789> tried .text() instead of .html()?
[12:26:04] <shoky> FernandoBasso what exactly is not working
[12:26:04] <nVee> kapo7789: (an empty string)
[12:26:12] <nVee> this is driving me insane haha
[12:26:50] <FernandoBasso> shoky: When I click 'topo', it should go back to top. But it is acting straggly. The text disappear...
[12:27:39] <FernandoBasso> By my haschange code should only deal with "<a class='case'...", not with any other <a> tags.
[12:27:57] <kapo7789> well, there may be problem with logging, try alert(), if it returns null, maybe parent("tr td:eq[0]") will return smth
[12:28:08] <shoky> what is 'back to top
[12:28:10] <shoky> '
[12:28:22] <kapo7789> i just don't know, gonna try this here
[12:28:25] <feyd> is there some specific term in programming to refer to a stand-alone function? widow, orphan, or something similar?
[12:29:11] <shoky> FernandoBasso ah
[12:29:53] <shoky> FernandoBasso your click event is dealing only with 'a.case' but your 'hashchange' event is global
[12:30:09] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Is it possible to avoid that?
[12:30:19] <shoky> just check what the newHash is
[12:30:31] <shoky> and return; if you dont wanna load any ajax
[12:30:49] <shoky> like.. if (newHash=='topo') or someth
[12:31:37] <nVee> problem was parents :/
[12:31:44] <nVee> what is the difference between parent and parents?
[12:31:57] <nVee> should parent not return the actual parent?
[12:34:18] <Jon47> parent returns the single immediate ancestor of the node
[12:35:01] <Jon47> parents returns all the ancestors, ordered by nearness, of the node
[12:35:03] <Jon47> or nodes..
[12:35:29] <FernandoBasso> shoky: I changed if (newHash) to if (newHash != 'topo'). Now, when I click 'back to top', the text doesn't disappear, but I won't go to top either. :D Any way, your idea will probably work. Perhaps checked in the wrong place.
[12:37:29] <zerobeholder> http://pastebin.com/xjKSA91p
[12:37:42] <zerobeholder> I tried gnarf...
[12:38:14] <zerobeholder> Still having trouble jQuery regex selecting.
[12:39:07] <gnarf> zerobeholder: nameinput shouldn't be an argument on line 43, it also should have a "var" on it on line 37
[12:39:20] <shoky> FernandoBasso you need an <a name="topo">
[12:39:22] <gnarf> also you can't put vars like that in regexp
[12:39:31] <gnarf> you need to new RegExp() them
[12:39:48] <FernandoBasso> shoky: I have, in the <body name='topo'>
[12:39:58] <shoky> no you have <h3 name='topo'>
[12:39:59] <gnarf> oh wait
[12:40:02] <gnarf> thats yer old code
[12:40:15] <FernandoBasso> Oh, I need an <a name='topo'>.
[12:40:19] <shoky> yeep
[12:40:21] <gnarf> zerobeholder: you need to exec( $(this).text() ) right ?
[12:40:38] <gnarf> also its likely $(this).val() on line 49
[12:40:42] <gnarf> instead of .text()
[12:40:58] <zerobeholder> with an exclamation point prepended, I don't want to select any of my regular divs elsewhere.
[12:41:39] <zerobeholder> correct. Each time someone changes the text in the box or I notice the value has changed on an incremental time basis, I would like the function to run.
[12:41:54] <zerobeholder> That part is not worked out, but that is easy stuff.
[12:42:28] <jholloman> so it appears that you can manipulate the ordering of events by messing with the data array
[12:42:38] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Thanks a bunch. You've saved my life.
[12:42:39] <Eviltwin> jholloman: Be careful when you do so
[12:42:49] <jholloman> var windowResizeEvents = $._data( window ).events.resize; windowResizeEvents.unshift( windowResizeEvents.pop() );
[12:42:50] <billygalbreath> hey hey! jholloman didnt blow himself up! yay! :D
[12:42:58] <Eviltwin> There's trickery involved in how .one, .delegate, and .live work
[12:43:01] <jholloman> will remove the last one and place it in the front of the ordering
[12:43:03] <saml> how can I find all elements taht aren't checked?
[12:43:07] <shoky> FernandoBasso: np
[12:43:11] <saml> do I do .each() .is?
[12:43:16] <saml> .is(:checked) ?
[12:43:29] <zerobeholder> so '!' + .* + $('searchinput').val() .*  is what I am trying to match...
[12:43:38] <zerobeholder> so '!' + .* + $('#searchinput').val() .*  is what I am trying to match...
[12:43:42] <jholloman> yeah I was reading through all of the event binding process and am sure that there is something very unsafe about how i'm doing this
[12:43:47] <shoky> billygalbreath lol ;)
[12:43:48] <jholloman> not likely to use the code, and dont recomend it
[12:44:52] <jholloman> i don't believe we use any event delegation currently, but dont want to break that in the future
[12:45:14] <shoky> saml: $(':not(:checked)')
[12:45:26] <saml> oh  :jQuery(".solr_param").find(":not(:checked)")
[12:45:45] <shoky> oh
[12:45:55] <saml> hrm doesn't work though
[12:45:58] <shoky> jQuery(".solr_param").not(":checked") ?
[12:46:02] <shoky> oh sorry
[12:46:05] <shoky> scratch.
[12:46:29] <saml> oh .not()  thanks shobhitg
[12:46:31] <saml> shoky,
[12:46:39] <saml> did you write jquery? it has all the functions i need
[12:46:49] <shoky> who me?
[12:47:03] <saml> why isn't jquery dom selector stuff natively supported in browsers?
[12:47:10] <saml> yes. are you the author of jquery?
[12:47:16] <shoky> lol. nope
[12:47:22] <billygalbreath> I am
[12:47:24] <shoky> that's John Resig
[12:47:47] <shoky> i'm not even a contributor
[12:47:55] <shoky> but i hope to be in time
[12:48:30] <saml> jQuery(".solr_param").find(":checked")  how come this is empty  when I have a checked element?
[12:48:35] <saml> oh descendants
[12:48:42] <Goopyo> Question: I want to update a progress bar during (100%) a ajax request which only takes 1/2 seconds. (1) Is that just stupid, and I should use a loading gif (2) is there a way for jquery to update the progress bar percentage during the time?
[12:49:04] <rns> anyone know why this won't update my dropdown menu with the "DCF" value that I'm setting? http://jsfiddle.net/WebMd/3/
[12:49:13] <saml> jQuery(".solr_param:checked")
[12:49:31] <shoky> saml: it depends what exactly you want to select.
[12:50:26] <jholloman> Goopyo: i'm pretty sure ajax is 100% or 0%, it wont provide you feedback on where it is in the process
[12:50:30] <shoky> Goopyo i don't think there's currently a way to do that
[12:50:35] <saml> shoky, cools
[12:51:14] <Goopyo> cool thats what I thought. Thanks
[12:51:45] <zerobeholder> Am I on the right track building my regex like this? var regexp = new RegExp("^!?.*"+$('#searchinput').val()+".*$")
[12:51:46] <shoky> of course, you could make other ajax requests to get a status update on the original one ;P
[12:53:32] <shoky> zerobeholder, looks legit. the exclamation mark is optional?
[12:54:01] <zerobeholder> I put an exclamation point in front so it never matched the rest of the divs on the page...
[12:55:30] <shoky> um what page
[12:55:41] <ngharo> zerobeholder: its very likely user input could botch your regexp, unless you're expecting regexp input for searchinput
[12:56:13] <ezio> anyone knwo why i can't get the date picker to be as small as it is in the example?
[12:56:34] <shoky> ?demo @ ezio
[12:56:34] <bot-t1> ezio, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:56:40] <rns> if I manually set a dropdown option do I have to someone refresh the select element?  I'm using this:  $("#selectBox").val(3);
[12:58:00] <zerobeholder> you are right, I need to change the ? to a {1} for matching once.
[12:58:03] <zerobeholder> var regexp = new RegExp("^!{1}.*"+$('#searchinput').val()+".*$")
[12:58:31] <hagabaka> zerobeholder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS
[12:59:13] <hagabaka> although if you run it only on client-side it's probably OK
[13:01:10] <zerobeholder> correct, only client side-- but interesting about the ReDos...
[13:01:18] <hagabaka> also, you never need {1}, X{1} is just X
[13:01:34] <zerobeholder> var regexp = new RegExp("^!.*"+$('#searchinput').val()+".*$")
[13:02:28] <zerobeholder> I'm going to try it.
[13:03:24] <poppiez> any way to track if the mouse is down without creating a boolean and listen for mousedown/up?
[13:06:21] <ezio> can someone tell me why this date picker is so big? http://jsfiddle.net/pnVBW/
[13:06:34] <ngharo> zerobeholder: regexp is a pretty inefficient way to do a "is string x in y" search

[13:07:31] <a111> I want to load a page into a div when a link is clicked, how would I do this? Anyone got a link to a tutorial?
[13:08:18] <zerobeholder> I do have the mozilla indexof function included for browsers w/o a JS engine new enough...
[13:08:25] <Whirl3d> a111, I don't have a link to a tutorial, but it's easy enough to do.
[13:08:58] <billygalbreath> a111: do a quick google search for jQuery AJAX
[13:09:39] <JamesLeeds> Any idea how I might trigger a moo tools click from jqueryy?
[13:09:54] <JamesLeeds> not an 'onClick' but the actual moo tools event
[13:09:55] <Whirl3d> uggh. billygalbreath, have you ever done a search like that? The results are all over the place.
[13:10:33] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: i guess. i've trained myself over the years to sift thru all the bs tho
[13:10:37] <ngharo> zerobeholder: if it works with indexOf, why bother with regexp?
[13:10:51] <Whirl3d> The probelm is, that not all of it is bs.
[13:11:01] <Whirl3d> most of it turns out to be useful info.
[13:11:10] <zerobeholder> it currently doesn't, and I am not sure how to select a div based on class without regex.
[13:11:29] <zerobeholder> I am using indexOf for some array management in the page.
[13:11:30] <ngharo> ?load @ a111

[13:12:16] <johnkpaul> @ a111
[13:12:21] <ngharo> of course :)
[13:12:25] <johnkpaul> don't worry ngharo, I've had that problem many times
[13:12:55] <Whirl3d> I wish that the jquery dev team would "endorse" a series of "preferred ways" to handle things as a concensus. But I suppose that's as likely as getting a car to run on sunshine and dreams.
[13:13:18] <johnkpaul> "handle things as a concensu"?
[13:13:24] <johnkpaul> sorry, I wasn't here for your conversation before
[13:13:25] <Whirl3d> I know. Impoosibble right.
[13:13:28] <ngharo> like load() vs ajax() vs get() ?
[13:13:56] <Whirl3d> for example. For the outside user, it's one thing. for you all, there are use cases.
[13:14:16] <johnkpaul> oh, I think the concensus is that people should undersand how the higher level apis work under the hood when under the hood is still jquery
[13:14:40] <johnkpaul> $.get delegating to $.ajax isn't a difficult concept, I don't think they need to remove $.get
[13:14:48] <Whirl3d> I agree. Just like I can't believe folks can't change their own alternators
[13:15:00] <zerobeholder> So, I think I am getting close. http://pastebin.com/FWmxPHSw
[13:15:04] <Whirl3d> yet folks still drive
[13:15:13] <johnkpaul> :) I am in that category Whirl3d
[13:15:16] <johnkpaul> I can change my oil though
[13:15:24] <johnkpaul> but
[13:15:31] <johnkpaul> if I were a car mechanic on the side, you'd bet I'd learn
[13:15:31] <NoiseEee> i can change my attitude
[13:15:33] <Whirl3d> You are doing better than most. Which is a testament to your genius, mind you
[13:15:54] <Whirl3d> The crazy thing is there's only one way to change an alternator
[13:15:56] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:16:29] <Whirl3d> not 50 million ways with 500 precocious teeenagers telling you your stupid for trying it the "wrong" way that day.
[13:16:54] <zerobeholder> Unhook the wires, two or three bolts, swap alternators, two or three bolts, and wires back on...
[13:16:55] * Whirl3d waves his cane at the screen
[13:17:01] <zerobeholder> ???
[13:17:10] <Whirl3d> Ta Da
[13:17:43] * tw2113 steals Whirl3d's cane
[13:17:44] <johnkpaul> well, Whirl3d, people don't have to change their own alternators because they can pay someone else to do it
[13:17:48] <billygalbreath> back when I was a kid we had to use a crowbar and two guys to change an alternator
[13:17:52] <johnkpaul> as I could with my oil too
[13:18:07] <johnkpaul> the big difference is that there's no gigantic free community for car repair school
[13:18:11] <johnkpaul> well, at least, I don't think there is
[13:18:16] <peterschmidler> How can I edit the href of a link?
[13:19:07] <zerobeholder> there may be a smarter way, but the href is an attribute
[13:19:11] <ezio> can someone tell me why this date picker is so big? http://jsfiddle.net/pnVBW/
[13:19:16] <ngharo> ?attr @ peterschmidler
[13:19:17] <bot-t1> peterschmidler, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:19:21] <zerobeholder> I would google .attrib or .attribute
[13:19:24] <peterschmidler> Thanks
[13:19:29] <zerobeholder> can't remember
[13:19:38] <zerobeholder> maybe even just .attr
[13:19:42] <Whirl3d> There are lots of great auto-repair communities and I guess there are bullies in them as well, come to think of it. This is one of the nicest online communities I have been a member of. People here are really generous and I think that for the most part if your are willing to learn and listen,  people are willing to help
[13:20:19] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath, back when I was a kid we used the same tools (crowbar et al) to post to BeagleBrothers BBS.
[13:20:41] <zerobeholder> I second that johnkpaul, it stopped being a better use of my time to do car repairs myself.
[13:20:51] <johnkpaul> yeah, I completely agree with you Whirl3d, and I'm very glad that there are people that are willing to learn and listen
[13:20:53] <Whirl3d> Boy I couldn't wait to get my monthly Beagle Brothers floppy disk with all the latest hax. LOL
[13:21:28] <ngharo> ezio: it's .form_input line-height throwing it off
[13:21:47] <zerobeholder> So, for most maintenance issues I do take it somewhere. I know how to replace my shocks, but spending time with my new son was more important than the cost.

[13:24:47] <Whirl3d> I used to spend a lot of time at Ultrashock when I developed Flash (that's right I said it, wanna fight?) and I learned a lot from that community. But as Flash died and the site went commercial...so did the people.

[13:28:48] <jholloman> in firefox: do scrollbars taking up px inside of the window bother anyone else? seem to have had a similar issue a few times recently
[13:32:27] <zerobeholder> I have added scroll bars on "short" pages so that margin-left:auto & margin-right didn't make the content jump a hair to the right or the left.
[13:32:57] <zerobeholder> I thought those little jumps were annoying...
[13:33:28] <jholloman> i keep ending up with scrollbars on during resize, resize then removes the need for scrollbars, and now i'm 17px off :(
[13:36:43] <zerobeholder> Scrollbars are a way of life. People generally accept them. If the 17 pixels are trivial and you aren't using them, just have vertical scroll the whole time even if not functional.
[13:36:58] <zerobeholder> But, I do that with CSS and not jquery or javascript.
[13:37:28] <Qix> Can you run two different queues on the same element at the same time?
[13:44:19] <zerobeholder> It's probably just me because I'm a newbie, but I'm not sure what you mean Qix.
[13:45:20] <zerobeholder> Do you mean time based triggering, or as the target of multiple events? Just not sure what you mean.
[13:46:14] <zerobeholder> Well, time to put stuff away and try again later. Thank you all for your help. I think I am close to getting it.
[13:56:00] <thnee> i'm guessing it's not safe to use height() in $(document).ready(), but rahter, I have to put it in window.load?
[13:56:33] <shoky> you shouldn't guess
[13:56:35] <shoky> its safe
[13:57:03] <thnee> shoky: but elements havent rendered in document ready? how can it be safe to measure them?
[13:57:19] <shoky> dom ready event is fired after load
[13:58:11] <shoky> thnee: the elements are part of the document. so if the document is ready then the elements are ready
[13:59:06] <Qix> zerobeholder: when you do queue() and dequeue() on a custom queue to queue up animations on a queue other than 'fx', can you start executing those queued animations separately and concurrently than the 'fx' queue?
[13:59:22] <Acrack> hellow
[13:59:46] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/AxWKf/1/ how to delete answer-block ????
[14:00:30] <shoky> didn't we answer that already?
[14:00:59] <thnee> shoky: I don't believe your'e right when saying that "domready event is firef after load"
[14:01:23] <thnee> http://api.jquery.com/ready/  says  "this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the script can be run as soon as the DOM hierarchy has been fully constructed"
[14:01:36] <shoky> and?

[14:02:30] <Acrack> shoky: u were talking to me ?

[14:07:28] <Acrack> before asking i try
[14:07:32] <shoky> hint: you're using the same selector twice
[14:07:40] <shoky> which you shouldn't
[14:08:15] <thebignoise> http://jsfiddle.net/Dsth5/ -- its telling me it has no siblings
[14:08:21] <thebignoise> which is false
[14:08:23] <natas77> is ther a way to reset all settings of aptana?
[14:08:34] <Carraway> random, non jquery question, but what's the typically most used irc client for os x?
[14:08:43] <shoky> thebignoise: how do you expect us to help with such little information?
[14:08:53] <Carraway> i'm using textual and I'm not entirely thrilled with it
[14:09:20] <thebignoise> shoky: sorry. im using jquery validator and i want to change the element in which it shows the error
[14:09:35] <shoky> Carraway i think colloquy
[14:09:42] <shoky> im not a maccer tho
[14:09:50] <thebignoise> the element that throws the error 'element' is good that works
[14:09:57] <shoky> thebignoise maybe you want $(element) ?
[14:10:01] <snow0x2d0> I think there's an os x version of xchat too
[14:10:03] <thebignoise> shoky: tried that
[14:10:12] <shoky> then you'll have to work harder on your fiddle
[14:10:15] <shoky> so we can.. fiddle with it
[14:10:19] <thebignoise> lol okay
[14:10:25] <shoky> like, make it work
[14:10:39] <shoky> add required resources
[14:11:04] <thebignoise> shoky: sorry my ignorance i found the solution
[14:11:12] <shoky> kool
[14:11:36] <silverwind> Colloquy is fine once you muted the sounds and changed the default theme.
[14:13:46] <saml> hey, I did window.onhashchange = f;    how can I unregister f , set hash, and regegister f?
[14:19:49] <thebignoise> is there a jquery validation irc channel
[14:19:49] <shoky> saml: window.onhashchange = null;
[14:19:50] <thebignoise> ?
[14:20:19] <shoky> doubts
[14:20:53] <thebignoise> anyone here really good with jquery validation. the plugin?
[14:21:00] <shoky> ?ask

[14:22:15] <thebignoise> well i have tweaked it so the error shows up in the element i want but when the error is fixed the 'error element' is removed
[14:22:26] <thebignoise> how can i make it so i can sop that?
[14:22:37] <shoky> told you what to do
[14:22:48] <dwarder> i took this code http://jsfiddle.net/9FrdK/ from http://jqueryui.com/demos/widget/ code example, i'm a bit don't understand is it the .toggle( [duration] [, callback] ) case of .toggle? and what kind of selection is ":custom-colorize" ?
[14:23:35] <saml> how can I remove all click event handler?
[14:23:43] <saml> jq.click(null); ?
[14:23:54] <thebignoise> shoky: this is a different issue
[14:24:27] <shoky> thebignoise: what i told you applies to most issues
[14:24:31] <shoky> ?demo
[14:24:31] <bot-t1> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:24:41] <thebignoise> oh lol sorry
[14:24:47] <shoky> saml: how did you add them?
[14:24:56] <saml> .click(function..
[14:25:12] <dwarder> anyone anything about my issue? manuals, urls or something?
[14:25:20] <shoky> saml: .off('click')
[14:25:31] <Zzaichik> Anyone used Jade Templates before?
[14:25:38] <shoky> dwarder: how about reading?
[14:25:44] <shoky> the link you gave
[14:26:37] <dwarder> shoky: can't find the info about toggle case and :this-thingie on the widget page
[14:27:09] <shoky> it's a custom selector
[14:27:32] <Zzaichik> Jade Templating, anyone‚Ä¶ used it? ..before?
[14:27:51] <dwarder> and it means the element to which .colorize() is applied, right?

[14:29:48] <Iarfen> Hi!!!!!
[14:29:52] <shoky> O M G
[14:29:54] <Iarfen> How I can call a callback after jquery executes a .html($data) function??
[14:30:03] <shoky> wat?
[14:30:23] <cambazz> hello, i am using the validation framework, and for numbers i am getting some errors. since in different locales, people use ,
[14:30:29] <cambazz> and validation requires .
[14:30:40] <dwarder> shoky: thank you
[14:31:52] <saml> basically, I have window.onhashchange = f;  I want to change hash without calling that f
[14:32:24] <saml> so, I do window.onhashchange = null;  window.location.hash = x;  window.onhashchange = f;  and it goes crazy
[14:33:09] <shoky> how so
[14:33:11] <nFFF> Iarfen, put a function directly after that line of code? :>
[14:33:41] <billygalbreath> shoky! help!
[14:33:42] <billygalbreath> http://jsfiddle.net/JEQZq/3/
[14:33:42] <saml> onhashchange, I do ajax... and depending on the content returned, i need to change location.hash  but not trigger hashchange
[14:33:46] <shoky> !
[14:33:49] <billygalbreath> !!
[14:33:52] <billygalbreath> :D
[14:34:10] <shoky> er ok, wat?
[14:34:16] <billygalbreath> the browser context menu is still firing although i feed it "return false" at the end of my function
[14:34:43] <billygalbreath> right click the "click me" text in my fiddle and you will see
[14:34:45] <nFFF> billygalbreath, you should use on instead of live btw as its now deprecated
[14:35:28] <billygalbreath> nFFF: show me. i just grabbed a script from http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/02/22/create-simple-jquery-right-click-cross-browser-vertical-menu/ and editing it for my use.
[14:35:36] <Zzaichik> but live was so crazy fun yo
[14:35:53] <shoky> billygalbreath, you're not returning false..
[14:36:11] <shoky> billygalbreath: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JEQZq/4/
[14:37:09] <billygalbreath> shoky: !!! why doesnt it take the "return false" from the bottom of menu.open() ?
[14:37:16] <shoky> why should it?
[14:37:24] <shoky> if you did: return menu.open();
[14:37:26] <shoky> then sure ;)
[14:37:32] <billygalbreath> ah
[14:37:35] <billygalbreath> i see
[14:38:03] <shoky> this ain't perl ;P
[14:38:06] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/735066/ shorter version? ;-P
[14:39:11] <nFFF> wtf is contextmenu
[14:39:13] <nFFF> is it a plugin?
[14:39:30] <cambazz> how can i validate that that someone enters 1.12 in a form and not 1.125
[14:39:34] <shoky> nFFF nope
[14:39:48] <billygalbreath> contextmenu is the right click menu
[14:39:50] <Mkop> I am finding that the selector var el =$("[name='"+item+"']"); is taking about one second in IE8
[14:39:54] <Mkop> is that possible?
[14:39:56] <billygalbreath> i'm overriding the browser's to put my own
[14:40:02] <nFFF> ?contextmenu

[14:40:05] <shoky> eshlox: $(this).parent().parent().parent().children().show().end().end().hide();      ??????????

[14:41:21] <shoky> oh actually the MDN one is ok
[14:41:25] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/PopupGuide/ContextMenus#Context_Menu_Events
[14:41:28] <Iarfen> nFFF: It has a problem, if the execution of html() hasn't finished yet, the funciton executes before, and I don't want that
[14:42:16] <shoky> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.oncontextmenu
[14:42:50] <eshlox> shoky: uhm, longer line ;-p
[14:43:53] <shoky> eshlox actually why not: $(this).parent().parent().show().parent().children().show() :)
[14:44:02] <shoky> sorry the middle one is .hide()
[14:45:29] <shoky> also you can use .closest() instead of .parent() twice
[14:45:38] <shoky> .closest() with a selector, that is
[14:45:50] <nFFF> larfen, it shouldn't
[14:46:47] <shoky> Iarfen: what is this 'execution' you're talking about
[14:46:50] <nFFF> but you can used defferreds/promises if you want to do it pragmatically
[14:47:08] <nFFF> ?promise @ Iarfen
[14:47:08] <bot-t1> Iarfen, .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[14:47:11] <Iarfen> shoky: I have a function and I want to execute that function after html() has finished
[14:47:23] <shoky> that's not what i asked
[14:47:25] <eshlox> shoky: ok, i try with closest, thanks
[14:47:26] <shoky> that's repeating yourself
[14:48:21] <mbtez> is there a way to say...if i clicked within element #blah...if i clicked on an a tag within #blah, do this, else, do that?
[14:48:51] <nFFF> e.target mbtez will give you the target element
[14:48:58] <mbtez> ah great thanks
[14:49:23] <nFFF> but you can also use .on() to bind to different elements within the parent
[14:49:32] <nFFF> and use e.stopPropogation
[14:49:36] <nFFF> your choice
[14:50:19] <mbtez> dumb question...how do i get the element type of e.target?
[14:50:25] <mbtez> as a string?
[14:50:34] <nFFF> it's an object
[14:50:38] <mbtez> gotcha thanks
[14:52:13] <nFFF> but in your case you would just do $(e.target).attr('id') === '#foo'
[14:53:01] <nFFF> not try and cast the whole object to a string and see if it contains #foo as I have a feeling you were thinking :D
[14:54:20] <mbtez> .tagName is fine
[14:54:29] <mbtez> just making sure i'm not clicking on my
[14:54:34] <mbtez> fake div area href :)
[14:54:48] <mbtez> hell of a workaround i have over here
[14:55:21] <p3mulis> is there a way to detect if the mouse is in a certain area of the screen via coordinates? I have a hidden div that I want to show if you hover over it
[14:55:34] <mbtez> yes p3mulis
[14:55:36] <mbtez> e.pageY, e.pageX
[14:56:10] <p3mulis> ohh wonderful. Thanks much!
[14:56:24] <mbtez> for $("body").click(function(e){});
[14:58:52] <shoky> nFFF: .promise() description says 'all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not'  . i'm not understanding the 'or not' part
[14:59:50] <shoky> if something isn't queued why should the promise depend on it :S
[15:02:26] <nFFF> more than one
[15:03:08] <nFFF> ?qeuee
[15:03:09] <bot-t1> nFFF, .queue() - Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[15:03:21] <nFFF> So if youve queued a unch of functions
[15:03:24] <nFFF> or if you havent
[15:03:32] <nFFF> it will run once its finished
[15:03:49] <nFFF> really cool new features imo
[15:06:51] <shoky> not-queued as in the fadeOut here?   $('div').fadeOut().fadeIn()
[15:10:58] <Whirl3d> I think that fadeOut and fadeIn use the default "fx" queue
[15:11:33] <shoky> yeah
[15:11:46] <shoky> but the fadeOut doesnt need to wait in the queue
[15:12:14] <shoky> i'm just not understanding something in the docs
[15:12:16] <Whirl3d> you are saying because it's already faded out, for example.
[15:12:24] <shoky> no
[15:12:34] <shoky> i mean the animation for the fadeout starts right away
[15:12:42] <shoky> unlike the fadein
[15:12:56] <Whirl3d> right. fadeOut has to finish before fadein can start
[15:13:00] <shoky> yes
[15:13:10] <shoky> so meanwhile, the queue consists of fadein
[15:13:12] <shoky> i think
[15:13:38] <Whirl3d> There's a dequeue method that I believe takes the first element from the queue
[15:13:42] <Whirl3d> so, I think you are right
[15:14:06] <shoky> but i'm not sure if this is what the docs are referring to
[15:14:08] <shoky> and nFFF
[15:14:17] <shoky> in .promise() that is
[15:14:38] <Whirl3d> My understanding is the promise() is just a way to get to a deferred without changing it's state.
[15:14:55] <Whirl3d> It's like signing up as a listener for the done or fail events
[15:15:47] <shoky> that's a promise object, yes
[15:16:00] <shoky> but i'm talking about the .promise() method
[15:16:04] <shoky> function
[15:16:05] <shoky> we
[15:16:43] <shoky> well i guess what you're saying applies to the function as well
[15:17:36] <shoky> in which case that .fadeOut() example is what they're referring to when talking about non-queued actions
[15:19:55] <Whirl3d> so it looks like .promise() uses the existing Deferred (stored in the elements data object) if it exists, but it if doesn't, it generates a new deferred object to return the promise
[15:21:18] <Whirl3d> But it also sounds like it somehow implies that the deferred will be resolved at some point. Which seems weird since you can't resolve from a promise and what else knows about the deferred?
[15:21:41] <shoky> if there is no existing deferred then the promise should resolve immediately
[15:21:45] <shoky> no?
[15:23:13] <Whirl3d> I guess so.
[15:24:02] <Whirl3d> but you can have multiple deferreds on an element, so how does promise decide which one to bind to?
[15:24:34] <shoky> all i guess?
[15:25:37] <Whirl3d> so then rather than having a master deferred that is resolved once all the other deferreds are resolved, you could just use the promise() method and it would manage that for you.
[15:27:45] <shoky> think so
[15:27:55] <Whirl3d> so if you use the promise method to setup an eventhandler for the animation queue, then it resolves when the animation is complete. But what happens if you animate the element again? Does the promise fire again?
[15:28:17] <Whirl3d> ik, ik, tias
[15:29:00] <shoky> uhm i think it only looks at what's there at the time of the .promise() call
[15:29:08] <shoky> otherwise it wouldn't be very useful ;p
[15:29:37] <shoky> but let's see.
[15:30:51] <Whirl3d> or would it...? hmmm
[15:34:01] <shoky> hmm
[15:35:17] <shoky> ok so you were right
[15:35:26] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N63wV/1/
[15:35:30] <shoky> sorry if its not very clear
[15:36:20] <shoky> upfront i put fadeout then fadein. then .promise() , then 3 seconds later i add another fadeout
[15:36:38] <shoky> promise only gets resolved after last fadeout
[15:37:33] <shoky> ignore the slider crap
[15:37:35] <Whirl3d> so, I can see where that would be cool
[15:37:46] <Whirl3d> but what about custom deferred objects?
[15:38:51] <shoky> aduno
[15:39:53] <shoky> wait but you asked if the promise fires again after it has already resolved?
[15:40:16] <jcp_> are there any speed difference between using just if statements, if else or switch? (e.g., http://jsfiddle.net/rUkXE/ )
[15:40:26] <shoky> no
[15:40:57] <shoky> unless your browser sucks
[15:41:37] <jcp_> cool thanks
[15:42:07] <shoky> but you do know that your option one and option two are totally different, yes ?
[15:42:10] <shoky> not performance wise
[15:42:13] <shoky> logically
[15:46:24] <erisel> hi guys
[15:46:46] <erisel> i've set up this small example on jsfiddle to animate some li's and it's working fine http://jsfiddle.net/Uch95/3/
[15:46:49] <mod> hi all
[15:47:08] <shoky> erisel its working pretty kewl ;)
[15:47:15] <shoky> i think you should keep it
[15:47:21] <jcp_> shoky: not drastically.. see http://jsfiddle.net/rUkXE/1/
[15:47:30] <savid> I have an array of names,  and I'd like to make a jQuery object that selects all elements that have those class names.  Is there a way to do that?
[15:47:36] <erisel> i've done the same exact thing here: http://bit.ly/J5NKDE and it will animate all of the li's :(
[15:48:01] <mod> I'm calling $(document).ready(function() { $('form').validate(); });  , no errors, but my validation is not running.  I have class="required" on various form items
[15:48:12] <mod> am I missing something?
[15:48:19] <erisel> shoky: thanks :)
[15:48:52] <zoned> what's better: $("#myRadio").is(":checked")     or      $("#myRadio")[0].checked
[15:49:03] <erisel> i'm really confused with this one
[15:51:09] <mod> huh, validate() cannot run on a list
[15:51:11] <shoky> jcp_: drasitaclly: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rUkXE/2/
[15:51:17] <shoky> drastically*
[15:51:30] <mod> when I supplied an an id   $('form#id').validate(), the validation runs
[15:51:59] <jcp_> erisel: http://jsfiddle.net/Uch95/4/
[15:52:04] <Whirl3d> this is weird. I guess I don't know how to attach a deferred to an element specifcally.
[15:52:06] <mod> i bet you have to supply an #id or a  $('form').each(funtion() { $(this).valdate() });
[15:52:15] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/xMKNY/3/
[15:52:19] <mod> you're welcome
[15:52:32] <jcp_> shoky:  oh ya, good poitn
[15:52:35] <jcp_> point*
[15:53:58] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/xMKNY/5/
[15:54:49] <erisel> jcp_: for some strange reason it won't work here http://bit.ly/J5NKDE im going crazy over this one
[15:55:12] <erisel> jcp_: it will still animate all of the li's
[15:55:20] <Tasser> is there a way to search below the current element?
[15:55:24] <erisel> li's are the color circles on the right
[15:56:29] <Whirl3d> actually, I can't even get jsfiddle to hide my p elements, so I am probably too brain damaged at this point to figure it out.
[15:56:50] <shoky> Whirl3d yea display:none :)
[15:57:10] <Whirl3d> stupid quotes
[15:57:38] <shoky> oh but it doesn't work
[15:57:45] <Whirl3d> odd, huh?
[15:58:21] <shoky> wait
[15:58:21] <erisel> Whirl3d: p.hidden {     display:none; }
[15:58:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I forgot to omit the '   thanks. BUt stilldoesn't work.
[15:58:59] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/xMKNY/12/
[15:59:12] <Whirl3d> I lied it works
[15:59:32] <shoky>  == colorFish.lenght
[16:00:26] <Uncle_Mother> dpress
[16:02:40] <Whirl3d> however,  the deferred only fires once (as originally suspected)
[16:03:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/xMKNY/14/
[16:03:33] <shoky> Whirl3d i see the problem
[16:03:39] <shoky> Deferred.promise()
[16:03:53] <shoky> The deferred.promise() method allows an asynchronous function to prevent other code from interfering with the progress or status of its internal request.
[16:03:54] <Whirl3d> I did it with done this time
[16:04:22] <Whirl3d> that just means that the promise can't call resolve
[16:05:05] <Whirl3d> in a function where a deferred is created, rather than returning the deferred (which would allow outside forces to resolve the deferred), you return the deferred's promise
[16:05:21] <shoky> yea i see..
[16:05:21] <shoky> Hm
[16:05:40] <erisel> shoky: any clue on why all the li's are being animated instead of only the one you're hovering on the other example?
[16:06:02] <Whirl3d> But I am not sure how to attach a deferred to an element so that you could use .promise() directly
[16:06:07] <shoky> erisel i see only the one im hovering on being slided
[16:06:58] <erisel> shoky: I set up a fiddle to see if i was doing something wrong, but the real world example is this one: http://bit.ly/J5NKDE
[16:07:30] <erisel> shoky: weird thing is that it's the exact same code...
[16:10:25] <ptw> #ckeditor
[16:10:35] <ptw> join #ckeditor
[16:15:21] <shoky> oh Whirl3d
[16:15:34] <shoky> you got the deferreds names wrong
[16:15:55] <shoky> twice allDeferred on the bottom
[16:16:10] <shoky> ah you changed it
[16:16:40] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/xMKNY/20/
[16:16:49] <Whirl3d> So, here's what I have tried last:
[16:17:04] <shoky> it worked with your original .promise().done(
[16:17:45] <erisel> lol
[16:17:47] <erisel> solved it
[16:18:00] <erisel> it WAS working, stupid css was tricking my eyes
[16:18:28] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xMKNY/22/
[16:18:29] <savid> Is there a way to see what events are bound to a jquery object in the console?
[16:19:16] <shoky> .data('events')
[16:19:37] <shoky> @ savid
[16:20:27] <savid> shoky, thanks
[16:20:36] <shoky> Whirl3d sorry i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xMKNY/24/
[16:20:42] <shoky> was on the no .promise() version
[16:24:44] <Whirl3d> here's a braindead question. How do you tell if an element is checked without a pseudoselector? .val()=="checked"?
[16:25:05] <Whirl3d> .prop("checked")==true;
[16:26:19] <jcp_> can you join these without messing with the variables? http://jsfiddle.net/A49zq/
[16:28:12] <nvez> jcp_: try $('#actions, #aside').find('button, a').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[16:28:49] <jcp_> nvez: yea, i was trying to use the variables but i guess i could do that thanks
[16:28:55] <shoky> and .prop('disabled',true) is even better
[16:29:06] <shoky> if you're in new jq
[16:29:13] <nvez> prop vs attr
[16:29:32] <shoky> in the ring
[16:29:40] <shoky> RUBMLE
[16:29:43] <jcp_> oh right, i keep forgetting about that new one
[16:29:44] <shoky> rumble:s
[16:29:47] <funkwarrior> Hello, I trying to implement a simple accordion with few lines of code to display a curriculum vitae of different guys in the same place: http://jsfiddle.net/UvNJL/2/
[16:30:11] <nvez> im too lazy to read docs
[16:30:17] <nvez> diff prop attr
[16:30:24] <beancurd> penis.
[16:30:39] <funkwarrior> seems working right oviously only if I put an active class on one of the div.more element but this not correct; what I'm missing?
[16:30:49] <shoky> nvez basically attributes are part of the HTML and properties are part of the DOM
[16:31:03] <nvez> tl;dr just use prop from now on?
[16:31:03] <nvez> :p
[16:31:27] <shoky> hmm for properties, yes ;)
[16:32:33] <funkwarrior> any advice?
[16:33:23] <mcsteve> funkwarrior: first off, no need to do 'div#' + id
[16:33:27] <mcsteve> ids are unique
[16:33:30] <mcsteve> still looking at the rest
[16:34:12] <shoky> funkwarrior: no div has 'active' class
[16:34:26] <funkwarrior> extacly
[16:34:51] <shoky> so why are you binding to something that doesnt exist?
[16:34:59] <funkwarrior> if I put on one of the div.more working fine
[16:35:15] <mcsteve> you need to handle the case when none is active
[16:35:15] <shoky> hold
[16:35:30] <mcsteve> since you only add the active class in the callback from removing active
[16:35:52] <funkwarrior> basically I want to code correctly without add an active class on the div.more inside html
[16:36:24] <shoky> funkwarrior: maybe this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/UvNJL/4/
[16:36:44] <shoky> tho it looks kinda funky
[16:36:56] <funkwarrior> oh whoaaa
[16:37:32] <acidjazz> how do i stop a setInterval again when im storing its returned obj
[16:37:43] <mcsteve> clearInterval
[16:37:50] <mcsteve> no, clearTimeout
[16:38:05] <funkwarrior> shoky: thanks a lot, it's really what I want...
[16:38:06] <grantg> damn, gmarty isn't here
[16:38:07] <bot-t1> (51 hours 50 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell grantg sorry was asleep and missed your comments! noted in original ticket however. hopefully fixed sooooooooooooooon.
[16:38:20] <grantg> heh
[16:38:24] <funkwarrior> mcsteve: thanks too
[16:38:28] <shoky> np
[16:38:35] <mcsteve> shoky got it
[16:38:59] <funkwarrior> shoky: it's run smoothly
[16:39:27] <shoky> i'm glad
[16:40:13] <funkwarrior> I was not so far from the solution.. :D
[16:40:48] <shoky> ;]
[16:41:15] <funkwarrior> shoky: once again, thanks!
[16:42:12] <nvez> dat netsplit!
[16:43:16] <jcp_> funkwarrior: http://jsfiddle.net/UvNJL/5/
[16:44:38] <Whirl3d> can a deferred be resolved more than once? Or can it be resolved with more than one target?
[16:44:58] <funkwarrior> jcp_: thanks a lot! but I think the previous version of shoky it's more comfortable for me
[16:49:32] <coolpro> Hello, I'm using some plugin for getting youtube videos from specific channel (http://www.yankov.us/youtube/jquery.youtube.channel.js) though it doesn't display everything in the way i'd like to (http://www.bukauskas.eu/solotck/#videos ) I'd like to get the code of every video in  this format: <a href="video_url><img src="video_thumbnail" /> <br /> Video caption</a>" Could anyone help me to edit the plugin to my preferred variant?
[16:56:27] <cambazz> how can i validate fractional digits
[16:57:37] <acidjazz> typeof() should still be 'number'
[16:57:43] <acidjazz> for decimals
[16:57:50] <acidjazz> also next time say decimals
[16:57:59] <acidjazz> saying fractional digits is like showing off
[16:58:03] <cambazz> acidjazz: :) yes ok
[16:58:06] <cambazz> but like
[16:58:18] <cambazz> i want the user be able to enter 0.99 but not 0.991
[16:58:33] <acidjazz> do you want to round it or deny it
[16:59:03] <cambazz> i like to deny it
[17:00:07] <mcsteve> could test it against a regex that ensures there are only two digits after the decimal
[17:00:30] <mcsteve>  /.*\.\d\d$/
[17:00:33] <mcsteve> something like that
[17:00:58] <cambazz> so a custom validator
[17:01:13] <mcsteve> i don't know of a built-in way to do it
[17:01:40] <cambazz> ok i think i can do that, but the regex scares me
[17:01:59] <mcsteve> this should help you test them: http://www.rubular.com/
[17:02:09] <cambazz> ok great!
[17:04:01] <mcsteve> "0.99".match(/\.\d\d$/)
[17:04:09] <mcsteve> will give you a result
[17:04:21] <mcsteve> "0.991".match(/\.\d\d$/)                 will return null
[17:05:22] <shoky> (num * 100) == Math.floor(num*100)
[17:06:07] <mcsteve> even better
[17:10:24] <shoky> tho that wouldn't work for negative nums ;p
[17:14:39] <cambazz> yeah, i have done the validator, and the regex that mcsteve wrote works. but, i am having some difficulties, namely, 100 is ok, 100.1 is ok, 100.11 is ok but 100.111 is not
[17:15:37] <Wilornel> guys, In jQuery, when you do a slideUp(); The elements below the item which is being slid up are being moved from their place
[17:16:00] <Wilornel> Is there a way to bypass this problem, so that the elements below a sliding up element dont move?
[17:16:07] <cambazz> Wilornel: put the item in a div, and give a height
[17:16:27] <Wilornel> just a sec
[17:17:25] <Wilornel> Uhm yeah
[17:17:33] <Wilornel> does not work
[17:17:49] <mcsteve> Wilornel: post code
[17:17:57] <Wilornel> I forgot to mention that my element is at first hided
[17:18:08] <mcsteve> cambazz: isn't that what you wanted?
[17:18:14] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2417517
[17:18:14] <mcsteve> 100.111 will not pass validation
[17:19:10] <cambazz> mcsteve but 100 wont neither, nor 100.1
[17:19:27] <mcsteve> oh ok i see
[17:19:28] <mcsteve> one sec
[17:19:39] <mcsteve> (but seriously, you should just use what shoky posted)
[17:20:00] <cambazz> let me look at that
[17:20:10] <Wilornel> so? cambazz?
[17:20:44] <cambazz> wilornel: one sec looking
[17:21:34] <cambazz> willornel: which one is the div you slide up?
[17:21:50] <Wilornel> the register
[17:21:52] <Wilornel> is being slided up
[17:22:40] <cambazz> ok but it is a td
[17:23:09] <cambazz> well you have to put it inside something, give this something a fixed height, so the botom piece does not move
[17:23:16] <Wilornel> oh alright
[17:23:25] <cambazz> mcsteve: I am looking at (num * 100) == Math.floor(num*100) - and i have not understood it
[17:23:29] <cambazz> ah
[17:23:32] <cambazz> i think i did
[17:23:35] <Wilornel> thanks canbazz
[17:23:37] <mcsteve> "100.11".match(/^[^.]*$|.*\.\d{1,2}$/)
[17:23:53] <mcsteve> probably a cleaner way to write that, but it works if you want to use a regex
[17:24:06] <mcsteve> Math.floor cuts of everything after the decimal
[17:24:17] <mcsteve> so if you're testing 100.11
[17:24:23] <mcsteve> 10011 == 10111
[17:24:26] <mcsteve> if it's 100.111
[17:24:42] <mcsteve> 10011.1 =/= 10011
[17:25:09] <Dr-Bombay> for positive numbers it does!
[17:25:31] <Dr-Bombay> yes I know, being nitpicky
[17:25:41] <cambazz> Dr-Bombay: no thanks dude
[17:25:56] <cambazz> I have a min: 0.01 statement so it covers that
[17:26:34] <cambazz> thanks mcsteve too
[17:26:39] <mcsteve> np
[17:27:09] <billygalbreath> =/= I've never seen anyone write it like that before. interesting, yet effective in chat.
[17:37:08] <Wilornel> cambazz
[17:37:10] <Wilornel> does not work
[17:38:01] <cambazz> does not work is not a good explanation
[17:38:06] <cambazz> do you have firebug
[17:38:15] <cambazz> look at it with fire bug
[17:38:34] <snollux> Hello hello. Can someone tell me how I can get the ID and value of each Select block? http://pastebin.ca/2137719
[17:38:51] <cambazz> attr('id')
[17:38:54] <cambazz> or value()
[17:39:11] <snollux> but if I just have one "on change" statement for all selectors
[17:39:17] <snollux> how can I get the selector ID?
[17:39:19] <snollux> this.id?
[17:39:27] <snollux> basically, get the info for the thing that changed
[17:40:12] <nvez> .attr('id')
[17:40:25] <nvez> $(this).attr('id')
[17:40:34] <snollux> thankss
[17:43:56] <Wilornel> cambazz: I just decided to make another div between the slided element and the content below it.  That div is also slideToggle() ed;
[17:44:01] <Wilornel> fixed the problem
[18:02:43] <gnarf> nvez: this.id
[18:03:13] <nvez> wasnt me who needed it :p
[18:03:28] <nvez> but good to learn the alternative!
[18:04:06] <gnarf> nvez: jQuery().attr() is a lot of work to do for this.id
[18:04:20] <gnarf> nvez: and you can basically count on it being there
[18:04:22] <gnarf> so...
[18:04:24] <gnarf> use it
[18:11:40] <coldhead> since when were you so generously inarticulate
[18:11:49] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[18:26:49] <tsavory> Anyone have time to help me find out why I can't get Columnizer jQuery Plugin to work in drupal 7?
[18:28:13] <nvez> gnarf: gotcha :D
[18:28:14] <nvez> thanks
[18:28:33] <nvez> i do realize that there should be a lot of things that i should avoid using jquery for and use js directly
[18:29:02] <nvez> but im too scared because i dont have good experiences with cross-browser stuff in js, so i feel like i'm fairly confident with jquery doing what i want to haha
[18:33:05] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use getscript?
[18:39:53] <chee> no one
[18:40:06] <tsavory> Anyone have time to help me find out why I can't get Columnizer jQuery Plugin to work in drupal 7? In Firefox appears to do nothing in IE and Chrome it breaks off the the first column right but does not display the second at all
[18:40:48] <chee> ?anyone @ ProLoser|Work
[18:40:48] <bot-t1> ProLoser|Work, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[18:42:02] <jrockjiggz> if i define a a function outside of the scope of jquery, can i just var $ = jQuery; ?
[18:42:25] <jrockjiggz> because the var will be contained within the function and not contamiate the global namespace
[18:48:30] <ProLoser|Work> is getScript a good solution for lazy loading? and what if i want to load 2 scripts and can't execute one before the other?
[18:48:35] <shoky> jrockjiggz yea i guess
[18:49:56] <shoky> usually you'll see something like:  (function($) { ................ } )(jQuery);
[18:50:16] <flecha> Hi! There is a list in the server that I want to sync with a list in the client (for example, a list of chat messages). How should I do that in Jquery?
[18:50:53] <flecha> (I mean, constantly sync)
[18:50:57] <shoky> flecha: $.ajax
[18:51:03] <shoky> or stuff that uses it
[18:51:14] <flecha> I saw, $.load
[18:51:18] <shoky> that'd work
[18:51:27] <flecha> but will it keep the list synced?
[18:51:42] <shoky> if you keep syncing it
[18:51:47] <flecha> hummm
[18:51:56] <shoky> like with a timer
[18:52:03] <shoky> setTimeout function
[18:52:20] <flecha> cool, I will try it, ty =)
[18:52:24] <shoky> np
[18:54:28] <brokenflipside> would this be the right place to ask for basic jq/js coding help?
[18:54:36] <shoky> the best place
[18:54:58] <brokenflipside> Great!
[18:55:34] <brokenflipside> can someone tell me what bonehead mistake I am making here?  http://pastebin.com/ikswZVSP  currently it alerts in reverse.  It says transparent when it should be colored and vice versa
[18:56:02] <billygalbreath_> flecha: i'm building a jquery chat as we speak, and i just have to speak up and warn you about the danger of reloading a list like you mentioned. the longer that list gets, the longer the load time for each sync. also, the longer the list, the more the page looks like its blinking when you overwrite the previous data. best practice is to grab as little data as possible each sync (i.e., only data that's been entered since the
[18:57:33] <shoky> brokenflipside: your code seems like it should always alert transparent.
[18:57:40] <shoky> your if is broked
[18:58:57] <brokenflipside> I don't understand how though, I thought I was saying if its not transparent say We have color!
[18:59:59] <shoky> think what your if will do if bgColorValues is equal to 'transparent'
[19:00:08] <shoky> er
[19:00:18] <brokenflipside> it will alert "we have color!" won't it?
[19:00:26] <billygalbreath_> http://jsfiddle.net/f2KxV/1/ brokenflipside
[19:00:27] <brokenflipside> isn't that what my else statement does?
[19:01:16] <billygalbreath_> brokenflipside: I just changed all your !== to == and it works as expected.
[19:01:48] <brokenflipside> let me fiddle around more. brb.
[19:01:52] <brokenflipside> thanks BTW!
[19:02:34] <brokenflipside> but the problem is I want it to do something when it is anything but transparent.
[19:03:17] <shoky> brokenflipside: your original if condition would be true if any one of these is true: bgColorvalues is NOT rgba(..).    bgColorvalues is NOT false.  bgColorvalues is NOT transparent
[19:03:26] <billygalbreath_> brokenflipside: well, in that case... look at this http://jsfiddle.net/f2KxV/2/
[19:03:34] <shoky> any one of those would make the whole if be 'true'
[19:04:05] <brokenflipside> oh i see.... i feel dumb
[19:04:41] <shoky> you were dumbish now you're not ;p
[19:05:06] <brokenflipside> thank you sooo much guys!
[19:05:12] <shoky> nnnp
[19:06:54] <flecha> billygalbreath_, thanks for the tip, I will keep that in mind =)
[19:09:09] <Wilornel> Guys, how to make a menu pop up from the header put not move the whole page?
[19:09:24] <Wilornel> but*
[19:09:50] <billygalbreath_> Wilornel: thats a CSS question.
[19:09:59] <Wilornel> Oh alright
[19:14:19] <tsavory> Anyone have time to help me find out why I can't get Columnizer jQuery Plugin to work in drupal 7? In Firefox appears to do nothing in IE and Chrome it breaks off the the first column right but does not display the second at all if there is a new line (aka <br> if just spaces then it shows up splits right.
[19:17:58] <flecha> I want to keep a list in the client. I list with all the cards and their IDs. But it should not appear to the user and I will want to acess it via script later. What should I use?
[19:18:12] <flecha> A list with...*
[19:19:26] <Rafajafar> hey, what does it mean when an input element's offset() is top=0 left=0 despite the element being in the middle of the page?
[19:19:49] <billygalbreath_> Rafajafar: relative to it's parent
[19:20:07] <Rafajafar> I thought that was position
[19:20:50] <flecha> Is there a way to put my list in a global var?
[19:20:54] <billygalbreath_> my mistake. Rafajafar
[19:20:59] <Rafajafar> position() also returns (0,0), it seems
[19:21:17] <billygalbreath_> Rafajafar: can you replicate in a jsfiddle?
[19:21:39] <flecha> (found the answer)
[19:22:37] <Rafajafar> I really cant
[19:22:50] <Rafajafar> the code is pretty complex, lot of ajax pulling in ajax
[19:23:26] <Rafajafar> I must have invalid html, but dangit, I can't find where
[19:24:57] <billygalbreath_> Rafajafar: perhaps you are trying to get the offset before the element is attached to the document?
[19:25:13] <Rafajafar> it's in a document ready event
[19:26:29] <billygalbreath_> but ajax is manipulating the page after ready event fires
[19:26:35] <billygalbreath_> .ready() is not an ongoing event
[19:26:59] <Rafajafar> yup
[19:27:10] <Rafajafar> this is the final state in the ajax loading mechanism ;-)
[19:27:19] <Rafajafar> it has its own document ready event
[19:27:42] <billygalbreath_> idk - i'd have to see an example or the live page
[19:27:57] <Rafajafar> only way I can arrange that is via skype
[19:28:15] <Rafajafar> this is hour 4, by the way, I'm going nuts it feels like
[19:29:18] <billygalbreath_> can you pastebin me something at least? i'm shooting ducks in the dark here lol
[19:29:41] <Rafajafar> yeah I can give you the final page that's brought down
[19:29:49] <Rafajafar> it has mixed in php code, I hope that's alright
[19:29:55] <billygalbreath_> thats fine
[19:31:18] <Rafajafar> I dont like jsfiddle as a pastebin, gimme a sec
[19:32:07] <Rafajafar> billygalbreath_: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1578105
[19:32:20] <billygalbreath_> k - give me a minute to look over this
[19:32:35] <Rafajafar> at the very top
[19:32:44] <Rafajafar> there's two lines which output the position
[19:33:06] <Rafajafar> the reason I do this is because dateRange is a widget for jqueryui
[19:33:26] <Rafajafar> when you focus on the text box with the id #dateRange
[19:33:34] <Rafajafar> a daterangepicker comes up
[19:34:14] <Rafajafar> it's really nice... but... the daterangepicker is aligning at  (0 - input.height )
[19:34:19] <Rafajafar> and is flush left
[19:34:33] <Rafajafar> brb, sorry
[19:35:35] <vitiate> need a bit of help: I have a set of social media buttons that do a background-position change on hover. I want the on-hover background-pos to fade in over the old one
[19:35:46] <vitiate> I've searched for hours and couldn't find a jquery solution for this
[19:35:52] <vitiate> does anyone have any advice?
[19:36:06] <markq> ?demo
[19:36:07] <bot-t1> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:36:19] <vitiate> yeah, hold on
[19:39:04] <Rafajafar> yeah I'm totally not sure what would cause an element to position properly but its position wont register
[19:39:13] <Rafajafar> oh by the way this is jQuery 1.6.1
[19:39:32] <Rafajafar> sorry 1.6.4
[19:40:41] <vitiate> so, let's say I have a setup like this:
[19:40:42] <vitiate> http://jsfiddle.net/C7aYM/
[19:40:52] <vitiate> what's the easiest way to get a nice smooth fade effect on hover there?
[19:41:00] <vitiate> and on mouseleave, of course
[19:42:23] <billygalbreath_> Rafajafar: can you provide me a link of the datepicker plugin you're using?
[19:43:14] <Rafajafar> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/
[19:43:28] <Rafajafar> maybe that got updated... let me check... it should be the 1.5.3 version
[19:43:32] <billygalbreath_> I get a 403 error viewing that page.
[19:43:45] <Rafajafar> their site's been funky, refresh a few times
[19:45:28] <billygalbreath_> ok, so that popup is positioning at 0,0 for you?
[19:45:44] <billygalbreath_> is it like that visually? or just offset reports that wrongly?
[19:45:50] <Rafajafar> yeah, minus the height of the input box
[19:46:02] <Rafajafar> I can show you, gimme one sec to upload a screen to imgur
[19:46:46] <billygalbreath_> ok
[19:47:10] <Rafajafar> billygalbreath_: http://imgur.com/czaX5
[19:47:38] <Rafajafar> I'm really starting to feel like the problem is somewhere else...perhaps a fadeIn
[19:47:49] <billygalbreath_> hmm
[19:47:56] <billygalbreath_> are you manually trying to set the offset somewhere?
[19:48:05] <Rafajafar> nope
[19:48:31] <billygalbreath_> the code you should me is trying to get the offset of the input field, not the actual div daterangepicker
[19:48:57] <Rafajafar> ahhh hah!
[19:49:02] <Rafajafar> that would probably be why
[19:49:37] <Rafajafar> let me try upgrading everything.... and pray nothing breaks from 1.6.4 to 1.7
[19:49:52] <billygalbreath_> try this $('.ui-daterangepickercontain').offset()
[19:50:02] <billygalbreath_> thats the actual container div of the popup
[19:52:28] <billygalbreath_> vitiate: this might help -> http://css-tricks.com/fade-image-within-sprite/
[19:52:47] <billygalbreath_> you are already using css for the hover, so use a css solution for the fade ;)
[19:53:27] <Rafajafar> billygalbreath_: you helped a great deal, thanks... upgrading seems to have done the trick... now I just have to retest...everything...everywhere
[19:53:44] <billygalbreath_> alright. glad you got it solved :D
[19:54:03] <vitiate>  billygalbreath_: aha, yeah, I saw this earlier on my search, but just glanced over the css solutions
[19:54:05] <vitiate> thanks for that!
[20:01:37] <Defrothew> Can anyone help me with jQuery? :D
[20:02:15] <tw2113> what's jquery
[20:02:21] <Joan> Just ask your question.
[20:04:31] <Defrothew> I was using Twitter Bootstrap Modal boxes. My question is how do you load content using "onclick".
[20:07:26] <tw2113> nope Defrothew
[20:07:36] <tw2113> i'm not that familiar with twitter's bootstrap
[20:08:19] <Defrothew> Ok. :)
[20:11:03] <abjorn> the fuuck
[20:11:13] <abjorn> after the last chrome update, chrome refuses to show favicons
[20:11:59] <brokenflipside> so my code works perfectly except in ie7 and ie8... my question is in the comment at the top of the code.  It's short I swear.
[20:12:01] <brokenflipside> http://pastebin.com/MM3sP6nt
[20:15:58] <coldhead> brokenflipside: perhaps you want undefined the value, not the string 'undefined' ?
[20:16:05] <coldhead> ?eval undefined == 'undefined'
[20:16:08] <bot-t1> coldhead: false
[20:16:50] <brokenflipside> i didnt think undefined was something I could call without a string?
[20:17:30] <Dr-Bombay> what a strange idea
[20:17:38] <brokenflipside> it didn't work...
[20:17:52] <brokenflipside> so what does == undefined in the eyes of ie7 and ie8 ?
[20:19:37] <kborchers> ?g falsy values javascript @ brokenflipside
[20:19:38] <bot-t1> brokenflipside, Truthy and falsy in JavaScript | 11 heavens - http://11heavens.com/falsy-and-truthy-in-javascript
[20:20:03] <brokenflipside> page not found... :(
[20:20:19] <kborchers> lol, it just worked a second ago
[20:20:25] <kborchers> undefined is falsy
[20:20:32] <kborchers> null is falsy
[20:21:20] <kborchers> so you could try replacing  || borderValues == 'undefined' || borderValues == null with || !borderValues
[20:21:29] <brokenflipside> i am using null
[20:21:35] <brokenflipside> ie doesn't care it seems
[20:22:18] <kborchers> brokenflipside: just try if (borderValues == '0px none rgb(0,0,0)' || !borderValues) {...
[20:23:16] <brokenflipside> good thought but no luck there either.
[20:23:35] <brokenflipside> i tried 0 and '0' also
[20:29:55] <brokenflipside> figured it out.  borderValues === null
[20:30:00] <brokenflipside> I needed the triple equals
[20:32:22] <coldhead> good work, brokenflipside!
[20:37:05] <foo3> hi
[20:38:33] <coldhead> hello web client user
[20:38:37] <foo3> test
[20:41:00] <coldhead> BLACK ANGELS
[20:47:56] <slide> Does $.post follow redirects? I mean shouldnt you not ever return information in a POST request but instead redirect to a GET request for what was posted?
[20:54:16] <billygalbreath_> http://jsfiddle.net/QaX2y/1/ <- this is rather simple, but for some reason I cant wrap my head around how to make this function work.
[20:54:48] <slide> oh hrm maybe it does
[20:57:58] <billygalbreath_> nvm - i figured it out
[21:04:55] <Robbo_> Okay so.. ajaxData = {}. I want to do ajaxData.$getStringHhere = something. Is it possible to have javascript use the string returned by a variable as the new variables name for the objecT?
[21:04:58] <Robbo_> Having a mind blank
[21:05:56] <Robbo_> nvm dont need it now
[21:06:38] <Cork> Robbo_: for future, yes it is
[21:06:45] <Cork> but not with dot notation
[21:06:58] <Cork> ajaxData[$getStringHhere]
[21:07:20] <Robbo_> Yeah just thought of that after typing... but just using an array now and pushing since other data I needed I no longer need
[21:07:25] <Robbo_> Thanks anyway
[21:41:02] <Whirl3d> Can someone explain what I am doing wrong with the Deferred object in this really simple script? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5GYYZ/
[21:43:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: promise is a function, not a variable
[21:44:24] <Whirl3d> thanks. I knew it was something simple.
[21:45:13] <Whirl3d> Didn't solve it though.
[21:46:01] <Whirl3d> still getting the uncaught type error....has to method 'then'
[21:46:35] <Whirl3d> done may have worked.
[21:47:57] <Cork> Whirl3d: then takes two arguments
[21:48:02] <Cork> done takes one
[21:48:07] <Cork> ?.then

[21:48:15] <Whirl3d> I wasn't aware that you had to provide both
[21:48:27] <Cork> none of them is in []

[21:49:16] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks
[21:49:21] <Cork> np
[22:05:25] <Whirl3d> So, Deferreds facilitate custom eventListeners for a single event, right--gross exagg. but that's basically what they do, isnt it?
[22:05:46] <wookiehangover> sure, you can think of it that way
[22:06:15] <wookiehangover> they're really just stateful objects
[22:06:19] <Cork> Whirl3d: no
[22:06:38] <Cork> Whirl3d: what deferred to is generating a callback chain
[22:06:41] <Cork> thats all
[22:06:59] <wookiehangover> Cork: promises are a bit more than callback chaining...
[22:06:59] <Cork> no timers no events
[22:07:14] <Cork> your adding variables to the object
[22:07:30] <Whirl3d> I didn't mention timer, but I hear you.
[22:07:31] <wookiehangover> what do you call "resolved" or "rejected" then
[22:07:35] <wookiehangover> if not events
[22:07:42] <Cork> callback members
[22:08:06] <Cork> why i don't call it events or timers is cause its not async
[22:08:07] <Whirl3d> So it is the equiv of a subscription
[22:08:19] <Cork> kinda
[22:08:24] <wookiehangover> its async by nature
[22:08:30] <Whirl3d> Then why not make them reusable?
[22:08:30] <Cork> no
[22:08:38] <wookiehangover> its only synchronous if the promise has already been resolved
[22:08:39] <wookiehangover> false
[22:09:02] <Cork> the promis returns an object that you can return to attach members on
[22:09:04] <wookiehangover> when you attach a callback to a deferred there's no way of knowing when it will be fired...
[22:09:13] <wookiehangover> that's what I call asynchronous
[22:09:19] <Cork> then you call presolv you set a "this object is resolved" on the object
[22:09:22] <Cork> and call all members
[22:09:36] <Cork> if you then add new members to the object they'r called directly
[22:09:55] <wookiehangover> sure
[22:09:59] <Whirl3d> Sounds like subscribers/event listeners
[22:10:07] <wookiehangover> I'm not saying that you can't treat them like callback chains
[22:10:12] <Cork> unless you use something that makes the code async deferred won't ever be async
[22:10:25] <Cork> so no its not async
[22:10:31] <Cork> (more then a function is)
[22:10:33] <wookiehangover> but I'd use $.Callbacks for that
[22:11:42] <Whirl3d> ?.Callbacks
[22:11:43] <bot-t1> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".Callbacks" in jQuery Docs.
[22:11:53] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[22:12:51] <Whirl3d> so, Deferred sounds to me like a souped up, one off version of $.Callbacks
[22:13:22] <Cork> its closer to an extended versions (promis added) to callbacks yes
[22:13:36] <Whirl3d> You could extend $.Callbacks to include a promise method that would limit access to the fire, remove, disable methods
[22:13:46] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:14:30] <Cork> it has named types of callbacks too, so that differ
[22:14:48] <wookiehangover> Cork: lets agree to disagree "jQuery.Deferred(), introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function."
[22:15:24] <Cork> wookiehangover: thats exactly what i've said
[22:15:37] <Cork> nothing async about it
[22:15:47] <Cork> it can be used on sync or async functions
[22:15:53] <Cork> but thats something else
[22:16:30] <wookiehangover> so deferred's arent async. got it
[22:17:04] <Cork> no every thing deferred does is in a strait line, so unless something else creates a separat thread its all sync
[22:17:04] <Whirl3d> Except that the definition should say **can relay the success, failure, or pending state of the synch. or asynch. event
[22:17:26] <Cork> Whirl3d: or timer
[22:17:31] <Cork> or network access
[22:17:44] <Whirl3d> what do you mean by timer
[22:17:51] <Cork> setTimeout
[22:17:55] <Whirl3d> am I saying something I don't mean to say?
[22:17:56] <Cork> or setInterval
[22:18:06] <Cork> no just limiting :)
[22:19:05] <Cork> thought timers work on timer events so your right on that one
[22:19:16] <Whirl3d> A deferred object can exist in one of three states: pending, success, fail
[22:19:24] <Whirl3d> Then start in pending
[22:19:25] <Cork> yes
[22:19:27] <Whirl3d> cool.
[22:19:48] <Cork> you can have progress handling too
[22:19:50] <Whirl3d> I don't think that I mentioned the word timer once. So...I am a little confused here..
[22:19:56] <Cork> from 1.7 that is
[22:20:28] <Cork> Whirl3d: i might have miss understood what you meant in that line
[22:20:31] <Cork> "state of the synch. or asynch. event"
[22:20:52] <Whirl3d> I was repeating the line from the description posted by his wookieness
[22:21:33] <Whirl3d> where it says it that it can relay success/failure. It should say pending, success or failure and as of 1.7 should also say progress,?
[22:22:08] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can send progress updates in 1.7 yes
[22:22:29] <Cork> ?.progress

[22:23:19] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:23:24] <Whirl3d> the page for promise is confusing.
[22:23:47] <Cork> everything about deferred was confusing until i read the code
[22:23:59] <Cork> everything sounds so magical when you read the docs :)
[22:27:12] <enrishi> I am trying to write custom events (triggers and handlers) in order to improve the way in which my site works. Specifically, I am using ajax calls to retrieve data server side; once this data is retrieved and a global object that stores the data is updated, i want to fire an event so that all objects in my dom that render this data will update themselves.
[22:27:30] <Whirl3d> so, I was trying to return an element (div that had content loaded) using .resolveWith(div) and I never got it to work. What do they mean by "context" for resolve with
[22:27:30] <wookiehangover> enrishi: look at backbone
[22:28:25] <enrishi> What is the suggested way of going about this? I've had a look at the documentation and it seems like one always needs to attach custom events to objects. But the events are not attached to objects.
[22:28:56] <enrishi> wookiehangover: I had a feeling I might need to look into javascript frameworks like backbone or node.js
[22:29:08] <Cork> enrishi: you want a global event or an event targeted at a single element?
[22:29:28] <enrishi> Corey: I want a global event.
[22:29:39] <wookiehangover> attach it to document or window then
[22:29:56] <Cork> enrishi: $.event.trigger('my-custom-event-loaded', [data])
[22:30:42] <wookiehangover> but backbone actually specifically solves this problem
[22:31:21] <wookiehangover> models and collections emit events whenever data is added, removed or changed
[22:31:28] <enrishi> Ok thanks. I am going to be setting up some pretty complex data handling (various arrays of time series data), so would you suggest that rather than creating my own custom objects and methods that I look at something like backbone or node.js
[22:31:38] <Cork> uh...
[22:31:45] <wookiehangover> node.js is server sider javascript, so no
[22:31:56] <Cork> enrishi: the line i showed will trigger any event with that name
[22:32:04] <wookiehangover> but backbone or any other client side mvc will do this for you
[22:32:07] <Cork> is there anything more you need?
[22:32:13] <enrishi> wookiehangover: ok I'll take a look at backbone, any others I should consider?
[22:32:15] <coldhead> server cider?
[22:32:22] <wookiehangover> mmmm cider
[22:33:02] <wookiehangover> enrishi: yes, type javascript mvc into the googles
[22:33:54] <enrishi> cork: I could definitely go some cider after the day I've had. The problem is handling lots of data, ajax requests, and DOM objects tied to this data. Backbone sounds good, I'll check it out. Thanks guys.
[22:39:58] <billygalbreath_> http://jsfiddle.net/gEJ2M/2/ <- is there a better way of doing this? There is a possibility there will be quite a few timers going on at the same time to blink certain elements like this.
[22:49:42] <markq> you could just change the color of it every 250ms
[22:53:23] <Defrothew> Guys, I got a question regarding dynamic element ids.
[22:53:31] <dr0id> ok
[22:54:17] <Defrothew> How do you implement $('#myModal').modal(options)         -  this to accomodate dynamic element ids like #myModal1 and #myModal2?
[22:56:05] <billygalbreath_> Defrothew: $('#myModal'+num).modal(options)     where num is the specific # you want to use
[22:56:05] <Viper007Bond> i have a question about "this". this code doesn't seem to work: https://gist.github.com/fce0231d894084b0f16e   the element the click event is bound to gets updated at first but doesn't get updated after the ajax request completes. the alert() works fine.
[22:56:22] <Viper007Bond> i assume this is because $(this) is no longer the original element or something?
[22:56:47] <billygalbreath_> markq: here's a better example of what I'm doing (more blinking div blocks and timers) --> http://jsfiddle.net/gEJ2M/7/
[22:57:04] <billygalbreath_> I'm hoping there is a better way of doing this rather than storing all the timers in an array
[22:57:28] <Defrothew> @billygalbreath_ I see, thanks. :D
[22:57:32] <billygalbreath_> the buttons dont exist in my production code, the timers are started and stopped from other methods that trigger them when appropriate.
[22:57:43] <billygalbreath_> i put the buttons there for this test case
[22:58:32] <suedoh> hello, what is the right way to select input fields to use ajax post?
[22:58:51] <suedoh> so that jQuery handles the structuring of the post data and escaping the data as well
[22:58:59] <Defrothew> @billygalbreath_ Thanks got it working. :D
[22:59:28] <Viper007Bond> oh, $(this) refers to the ajax jquery object rather than the dom object in my code
[22:59:30] <billygalbreath_> np, Defrothew
[23:00:31] <Viper007Bond> yeah, doing var my_element = this; before the ajax call and then using my_element does the trick :)
[23:00:37] <suedoh> sorry, i just want to add, i don't have a <form>, i'm trying to programatically select the <input id="" fields using the id or name.
[23:22:09] <suedoh> anyone know if it's a good idea to use jQuery Mobile even when writing apps for regular desktop browser?
[23:24:01] <astropirate> suedoh, its not a "bad" idea
[23:24:20] <suedoh> actually my question may have been bad
[23:24:29] <suedoh> i really like the jquerymobile.com website "look-and-feel"
[23:24:39] <suedoh> is that part of the jquerymobile framework, or is it just a custom design?

[23:31:31] <gf3> Zed7: What is an include operator?
[23:31:39] <Whirl3d> &&

[23:31:56] <billygalbreath_> here's where i'm at: http://jsfiddle.net/gEJ2M/27/
[23:32:21] <Zed7> eg: if($myvar "includes" 1){} instead of ($myvar == 1){}
[23:32:24] <billygalbreath_> now if only I could make it work without a set number in that array I'd be all set
[23:32:32] <Zed7> oh cool, thanks Whirl3d!

[23:36:39] <gf3> granden: check the docs
[23:36:44] <granden> ok, thanks
[23:37:03] <gf3> granden: well in that case you want $.map
[23:37:05] <gf3> granden: http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.map
[23:38:20] <gf3> granden: e.g.: var titles = $.map( your_junk, function( n ) { return n.title })
[23:41:00] <granden> gf3: Ok, but dont get it
[23:41:07] <granden> why is .map better then .each for this?
[23:41:21] <gf3> granden: they are slightly different
[23:41:37] <gf3> granden: each iterates over a list, map transforms a list
[23:43:24] <gf3> ?eval var a = [{ title: "cats" }, { title: "dogs" }, { title: "lizards" }]; $.map(a, function(n){ return n.title }) // granden
[23:43:24] <bot-t1> gf3: ["cats", "dogs", "lizards"]
[23:43:28] <granden> dunno if I'm explaining it that good. I got an array of arrays. Like { {title:"myTitle",img:"myIimg"} {title:"mySecondTitle",img:"mySecondimg"}}
[23:43:30] <gf3> ?eval var a = [{ title: "cats" }, { title: "dogs" }, { title: "lizards" }]; $.each(a, function(n){ return n.title }) // granden
