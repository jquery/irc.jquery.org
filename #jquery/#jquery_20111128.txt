[00:03:05] <_nix00> Eviltwin: yes,I am using it. but after I compiler jquery-ui source code. the jquery-ui.min.js cause an error.  "Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined" , So I ask here, I think my compile method is not right. need some document about how to compiler jquery-ui from source code.
[00:03:38] <Eviltwin> _nix00: Why not just use the minified versions they provide?
[00:04:24] <_nix00> Eviltwin:  jquery-ui-1.9m6-118-g74a3f2c , get it from github
[00:04:39] <ajpiano> _nix00: are you trying to use advanced optimisations
[00:04:40] <ajpiano> on CC
[00:05:02] <ajpiano> if so jquery and jquery ui do not support that
[00:05:31] <_nix00> ajpiano: no , just use java -jar compiler.jar —js ui/file1.js —js ui/file2.js …..
[00:06:19] <ajpiano> _nix00: you can build jquery ui from a git checkout by doing 'ant' from the command line, i believe
[00:06:22] <ajpiano> it's way too late for me to be up
[00:07:23] <_nix00> ajpiano:  ok, let me try. do you know some document about this ? I need to learn it.
[00:08:05] <ajpiano> i don't know of one that's good at the moment,
[00:08:43] <Eviltwin> _nix00: http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/limitations.html
[00:13:53] <_nix00> ajpiano: it works ! use ant compiler it successful!
[00:14:05] <ajpiano> hooray
[00:19:05] <_nix00> I suggest jqery-ui maintenance should make a how to that build min files from jqeury-ui source code. it maybe takes some time to find the answer for newplayer :)
[00:41:55] <mercury_> hi. can anybody helps me with this some if sentance. i want to check some field if has anythink else than ; and a-z
[00:42:19] <mercury_> only allow from A to Z and numbers and semicolon ; .. thats it.
[00:47:44] <bjensen> is it possible to warn the user if he tries to exit your site? In case of unsubmitted forms etc
[00:48:17] <Woet> bjensen: yes, most browsers support it
[00:48:34] <bjensen> Woet: how can I activate it for my site?
[00:48:52] <Woet> window.onbeforeunload = function () { return "Are you sure you want to leave?"; }
[00:49:00] <Woet> onbeforeunload
[00:49:02] <Woet> sounds awesome right
[00:49:02] <bjensen> Ah..thanks
[00:49:20] <bjensen> hehe indeed ;-)

[00:52:23] <mercury_> how to create if sentance with jquery .find ? I want to find some text in div and get true or false
[01:41:10] <negev> hi, is it possible to use .sortable() on a table but have only one column where the row can be dragged?
[01:45:23] <luite> negev: use the handle property to select the elements that can be used to drag
[01:49:28] <tommyd> Hi all! I'm quite new to jQuery and currently have a problem with jQMobile on a Blackberry device (do'h!)
[01:50:00] <tommyd> the problem I'm facing is that the static HTML page I'm having here has no CSS styles applied
[01:50:23] <raulirikama> can you send a link to it?
[01:50:34] <tommyd> probably because the Javascript that is executed initially that parses all the proprietary "data-*" HTML attributes doesn't run properly
[01:51:27] <tommyd> I'm testing here with a BB 4.6 emulator that should come with decent CSS 2.1 and JS 1.4 support already, but without success
[01:51:49] <tommyd> (I know BB 4.5 and below are dead meat for various reasons, but I should get 4.6 and above supported somehow)
[01:52:00] <tommyd> has anybody experienced similar issues before?
[01:53:00] <tommyd> ok, I guess there is a more on-topic channel for this - #jquerymobile
[01:53:06] <tommyd> sorry for the noise
[01:58:23] <woozly> guys, I have create <form> for ajax input.. but how to handle Enter keypress for this form?
[02:02:06] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:02:12] <aaronmcadam> woozly: bind to the submit
[02:02:24] <aaronmcadam> keyCode === 13
[02:02:36] <aaronmcadam> is the Enter key
[02:02:55] <aaronmcadam> but if u hit enter from a form, it will automatically call the submit event
[02:08:24] <thebigkiwi> has anyone come across an issue with IE where it won't load any links? the page displays, but links don't work - http://www.timfinn.com/music/
[02:09:25] <thebigkiwi> ie 7, 8 so far, 9 is fine
[02:13:21] <thebigkiwi> cvm, fixed it
[02:18:24] <muzone> what can i use instead of slideUp if I just want a box to appear?
[02:18:29] <muzone> no sliding, fading or animating
[02:19:56] <aleray_> hi, what is the most efficient? reordering html nodes or changing their left css property ?
[02:24:33] <Slartibart> muzone: show()?
[02:24:57] <muzone> thanks Slartibart
[02:25:56] <muzone> Slartibart: i have one more though
[02:26:01] <muzone> if that's okay!
[02:26:10] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make main nav a's stay grey when you hover their children?
[02:26:22] <muzone> Right now I'm using jQuery to change the colors on over- and out functions - but the changing it back to the original happens sooner than the dropdown disappears due to hoverIntent's timeout I think - is there a way to fix this?
[02:32:29] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links change back to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? I.e. at http://www.net-a-porter.com
[02:32:33] <muzone> I'm using hoverIntent (like hover but more user-friendly) and it has a slight timeout that the main links do not follow.
[02:34:03] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/34/
[02:34:12] <Zogot> sorry, i think i took over your save lol
[02:34:15] <Zogot> but thats what i got
[02:35:29] <muzone> Zogot: cool
[02:35:33] <muzone> you just took out the timeout or?
[02:35:41] <Zogot> didn't use the hoverIntent
[02:35:52] <jkuery> Hm this dosnt directly has to do with jQuery but i can guess you guise knows CSS as well as jQuery's, anyway to the thing... I have two diffrent Div's one at the left-side other one at the right-side... I have set the left-side height to 100%, and it fills out the whole side, the problem is when the right-side-div is growing (as with jquery) the leftside dosnt fill when scrolling down, any
[02:35:52] <jkuery> ideas?
[02:36:05] <muzone> oooh
[02:36:18] <muzone> well i gotta use hoverintent :(
[02:36:59] <Cork> jkuery: you need to set the height of the other element, or use position: absolute
[02:37:34] <Cork> jkuery: css can't do it in normal page flow
[02:38:11] <Zogot> if you put the left div inside the right div, and set its height to 100% then it should follow the new size increase of the right div though
[02:38:39] <Chetic> how do I add more post-variables when submitting a form with post?
[02:38:42] <Zogot> or put both in a parent container
[02:38:54] <jkuery> Cork i have set position: absolute; and hight: 100%;
[02:38:57] <jkuery> height*
[02:39:39] <muzone> Can anybody get a hold of that new Bob Marley movie (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7C7ZAN3oS4), CornerStore (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=460DGzlmL14) or Joy Road (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QValRrHuMGQ)?
[02:40:15] <Goat1000> hi
[02:40:29] <Cork> jkuery: top: 0; bottom: 0
[02:40:30] <Goat1000> does anyone know if there is a problem with the plugins site?
[02:40:39] <Cork> jkuery: height 100% doesn't always work
[02:41:12] <Cork> Goat1000: specify "problem"
[02:41:14] <Goat1000> a plugin of mine has gone missing
[02:42:22] <jkuery> Cork tryed it too no diffrent at all
[02:42:45] <Cork> jkuery: and the parent element has position: relative?
[02:42:50] <Goat1000> it's not in my list of projects, though if I go to track I can see the releases
[02:43:14] <Cork> Goat1000: might be better to contact the site admins
[02:43:46] <Goat1000> ok, thanks
[02:44:45] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? I'm using hoverIntent (like hover but more user-friendly) and it has a slight timeout that the main links do not follow.
[02:46:06] <woozly> guys, how to select with :not but with multiple :not ? I need something $("tr:not(.delete):not(.cannotclick)") ? can I do like this?
[02:47:28] <iaj> Hey there ppl!
[02:48:09] <iaj> Is there some way to substitute a certain link with another one on a page?  eg. replace http://foo.org/foobar#form  with http://foo.org/barfoo#form   ?
[02:48:54] <Zogot> jkuery: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/NpCzh/14/ something like that?
[02:49:37] <Zogot> oh, minus the float :p but yeh you get the idea
[03:00:15] <vmassuchetto> I'm making a $.post() request to a PHP file that takes a lot of time to complete. Is there a way to display sections of the result as long as I have them?
[03:00:46] <ravenzz> you should flush from the php side
[03:00:53] <ravenzz> google it
[03:13:26] <beasty> mm
[03:39:41] <icedwater> What does a $.getJSON() call do in terms of HTTP get requests?
[03:42:38] <mgoeppner> icedwater: what do you mean?
[03:43:14] <icedwater> mgoeppner: I'm trying to imitate a getJSON() call by passing the data in a browser address bar.
[03:43:45] <icedwater> I've had some success passing the arguments in {data} as a &-delimited list, but not sure if there's another way.
[03:44:34] <mgoeppner> icedwater: it depends on how the server is set to respond
[03:45:22] <icedwater> Makes sense :P Sigh... trying to deconstruct proprietary models to coax a server into returning a list of comments...
[03:46:07] <mgoeppner> trick would be figuring out their api
[03:46:26] <icedwater> I'm trying to grab comments off videos so I can build a corpus for my master's thesis, but I'm not asking them directly because I don't know if they'd like someone poking around like this.
[03:46:51] <icedwater> Yeah, mgoeppner, and I'm new to jquery on top of all this, so it's really a huge shot in the dark.
[03:46:57] <mgoeppner> you could try the chrome dev tools
[03:47:07] <mgoeppner> if their site loads the comments via ajax
[03:48:17] <icedwater> Hmm, inspect element and friends?
[03:48:25] <mgoeppner> the network tab in there
[03:48:34] <mgoeppner> it tracks all the requests for a page
[03:48:48] <mgoeppner> open the tools, go to the network tab and refresh
[03:48:55] <mgoeppner> you should see it populate
[03:49:01] <mgoeppner> then load some comments
[03:49:27] <mgoeppner> if they are loaded via ajax, the json request and result will show up
[03:49:37] <icedwater> mgoeppner: I have a timeline tab... no network
[03:49:49] <mgoeppner> yeah that one sorry
[03:50:06] <icedwater> mgoeppner: It's OK. Thanks :)
[03:50:32] <mgoeppner> np icedwater, its called network on the chromium nightly builds
[03:50:37] <icedwater> Damn, should have asked here first... I was browsing their JS and trying to clean up their deliberately messy code.
[03:50:56] <icedwater> Took me days just to get to this stage where I can kind of figure out what to ask
[03:51:06] <mgoeppner> xD everyone runs their js thru a minifier and or obfuscator these days
[03:53:35] <TheCode> is $(selector).on() the new way of adding event listeners?
[03:53:39] <icedwater> mgoeppner: Yeah, I don't take the trouble to... I'm one of the few who believes in opening source.
[03:53:52] <icedwater> And not just technically-open source, it should be open open. :P
[03:54:30] <icedwater> But I guess it does make code smaller... though I'm not sure that's the motivation for minifier/obfuscator
[03:54:32] <mgoeppner> icedwater: aye. But a minifier is usually good.
[03:54:57] <mgoeppner> obfuscators just piss curious developers off.
[04:00:29] <easyrider> How to handle IE bug - .append() ?
[04:00:41] <easyrider> I'm trying to append html table
[04:00:59] <icedwater> mgoeppner: I see a bunch of captured records in the timeline, but I haven't seen them appear.
[04:01:58] <icedwater> OK, I was just blocked by the console I pulled up.
[04:03:13] <icedwater> mgoeppner: I'm seeing a bunch of records like 'timer fired', 'evaluate script', etc. But not really the requests it's making.
[04:06:08] <mgoeppner> hmmm... yeah you need the network tab
[04:06:28] <mgoeppner> http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/network.html
[04:08:27] <icedwater> Hm, probably gotta get a nightly build of chromium then.
[04:08:47] <mgoeppner> prob
[04:09:07] <mgoeppner> sec i'll link you to the build
[04:09:09] <mgoeppner> s
[04:09:17] <mgoeppner> http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/index.html
[04:11:16] <icedwater> mgoeppner: Thanks
[04:11:25] <mgoeppner> no problem
[04:12:12] <icedwater> I'm assuming chrome-linux.zip and the usual configure, make install should do it.
[04:13:43] <mgoeppner> everything in that tree should be prebuilt executables
[04:14:43] <icedwater> Hm, OK
[04:14:50] <bjensen> Can I print out a specific region of a page without the use of frames or popups?
[04:15:14] <mgoeppner> unzip to a folder, set permissions on the chrome file
[04:15:28] <mgoeppner> and run from there
[04:16:04] <xec> bjensen: as a user?
[04:16:23] <icedwater> mgoeppner: Doesn't appear that way though.
[04:16:44] <bjensen> xec: yeah..I want my users to print out a specific div. I could of cause just hide everything else in the print media css..
[04:17:04] <icedwater> mgoeppner: this is what I downloaded (39mb): http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/Linux/111684/chrome-linux.zip
[04:17:52] <xec> bjensen: http://css-tricks.com/examples/ThePrintliminator/ <-- pretty cool, but if you want something like a print button on different parts of a page you're creating, hiding stuff would be the way to go i guess
[04:18:01] <bjensen> thanks
[04:18:35] <xec> that's a bookmarklet, which is why i asked if you wanted it for yourself as a user ;)
[04:18:39] <icedwater> I get a bunch of libraries and shared objects, but nothing to run.
[04:20:29] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? I'm using hoverIntent (like hover but more user-friendly) and it has a slight timeout that the main links do not follow.
[04:20:29] <mgoeppner> icedwater: yeah, unzip it somewhere, chmod +x chrome
[04:21:05] <mgoeppner> then you should beable to run it
[04:21:09] <icedwater> Was going to do it, fighting several fires at once.
[04:21:25] <mgoeppner> sure np
[04:21:45] <icedwater> My keyboard/mouse are not working in normal mode, had to startx via single user, su-ed as myself to get online :S
[04:21:56] <mgoeppner> ouch.
[04:22:22] * icedwater whispers: can you tell I'm not a good RTS player? :P
[04:22:31] <mgoeppner> xD
[04:23:29] <icedwater> Ah, turns out it was already +x ed... you just can't double-click it in nautilus.
[04:23:33] <icedwater> Silly :P
[04:23:37] <mgoeppner> xD
[04:23:52] <bjensen> xec: ah..I see..well it would be nice if it could output the css for me to use to hide those elements
[04:24:41] <xec> bjensen: it just does a simple display: none;
[04:24:54] <bjensen> yeah..so it should just list those :)
[04:24:59] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? I'm using hoverIntent (like hover but more user-friendly) and it has a slight timeout that the main links do not follow.
[04:25:21] <xec> bjensen: i'm not following
[04:25:43] <Ortund> HI! I need to display a circular image on my page, and animate a rotation to another picture onmouseover. The rotation should be similar to a horizontal flip from image1 to image2, does anyone know of a plugin to help me do this?
[04:25:53] <mgoeppner> muzone: you changing color in a callback?
[04:25:54] <Ortund> I don't know jquery well enough to do it myself
[04:26:11] <mgoeppner> oh look a fiddle.
[04:26:18] <muzone> mgoeppner: what do you mean?
[04:26:22] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Berit (http://home.no/dwaynie/berit.mp3)
[04:26:56] <mgoeppner> muzone: lower your timeout
[04:27:21] <muzone> the timeout needs to be there
[04:27:39] <mgoeppner> just lower it
[04:27:44] <muzone> so incase the user accidentally moves away from the hoverarea the menu wont collapse all of a sudden
[04:28:04] <muzone> i need that timeout to also apply to the main links though.. any idea?
[04:33:44] <muzone> mgoeppner: hey?
[04:34:06] <mgoeppner> muzone: give me a sec
[04:34:19] <muzone> awesome
[04:40:03] <mgoeppner> muzone: move your hover code from the css into the js
[04:40:14] <mgoeppner> change the header color on hover
[04:40:22] <mgoeppner> in the hoverintent block
[04:40:41] <muzone> mgoeppner: i think i already did that though?
[04:40:54] <muzone> sure u on the right pastie? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/
[04:41:01] * muzone double checks he's on the right pastie :P
[04:41:04] <muzone> fiddle i mean
[04:45:04] <dustincg> i'm going crazy with this, shouldn't this be outputting the same element… var submit = this.el.getElementsByClassName('managerSubmit'); console.log(submit); console.log($(submit)[0]); ?
[04:46:11] <shesek> dustincg, no
[04:46:20] <dustincg> awesome, why not?
[04:46:34] <shesek> dustincg, `submit` is a array-like object that contains a collection of DOM element
[04:46:59] <shesek> When passing that array-like object to $(), you're getting back a jQuery-wrapped version of those elements, and [0] is the first one
[04:47:09] <shesek> submit[0] should be the same as $(submit)[0]
[04:47:25] <tehOPEologist> hey all, i have a question about the possibility of jQuery checking what file (ie: an image) in a directory is the newest one, and loading that image on a page.  any help guys?
[04:47:52] <shesek> tehOPEologist, that's not something you wanna be doing with client-side code
[04:48:09] <shesek> you'll have to download (or at least send HEAD requests) to all the files, process it, than display
[04:48:38] <shesek> It would be much better with a server-side script that does all that checking and tells the client-side what's the latest image
[04:48:38] <tehOPEologist> shesek, so php?
[04:48:40] <Cork> tehOPEologist: you could have a server file that returns a json with the results
[04:48:59] <tehOPEologist> hm, ok..  i'm not that familiar with php doing that.  any tips?
[04:49:00] <shesek> tehOPEologist, well, whatever you're using on the server-side... if its PHP, than PHP, yeah
[04:49:14] <tehOPEologist> (i was wondering why there was no jquery tuts online about it XD  haha)
[04:49:25] <dustincg> shesek: you're absolutely right, that isn't my real problem i was just doing that to debug…so i might have another question in a second, but thanks =)
[04:49:26] <tehOPEologist> i basically made a simple image uploader on my site
[04:49:34] <mgoeppner> muzone: check your selectors.
[04:49:39] <shesek> tehOPEologist, its not about a tutorial - its just not efficient to do that with client-side code
[04:49:46] <tehOPEologist> and i want the site, after the user uploads the image, to show the latest uploaded image
[04:50:03] <tehOPEologist> so i can output that image as like a preview
[04:50:03] <shesek> tehOPEologist, in regards to php, check ##php, php.net/filemtime and php.net/readdir
[04:50:23] <shesek> tehOPEologist, why check for the latest image than, instead of just showing him what he just uploaded?
[04:50:35] <shesek> during the upload process, send the URI for the image back to the client
[04:50:41] <shesek> s/during/after
[04:51:03] <tehOPEologist> true, i can output the file's URL
[04:51:20] <tehOPEologist> but i basically want it so that it does it for the person once they go to the "checkout" page
[04:51:52] <tehOPEologist> so, they upload the image, the php script i have uploads it to the folder i created, then once it's uploaded, it says it's been uploaded and to continue to the checkout page
[04:52:15] <tehOPEologist> once they're at the checkout page, i want to show the image they uploaded on the checkout page, along with some mock-up purchase forms
[04:52:35] <shesek> tehOPEologist, if you only care about the latest upload, just delete the previous ones and just keep the latest one uploaded
[04:52:37] <tehOPEologist> i thought i could just use the post from the image uploader, but i couldn't figure out how to do that
[04:52:48] <tehOPEologist> !
[04:52:50] <tehOPEologist> that's a good idea
[04:52:55] <shesek> if you do care about all of them, just store it in a cookie / hidden form input / query string argument and pass it along to the checkout form
[04:52:59] <tehOPEologist> just make EVERY upload be named the same thing
[04:53:05] <tehOPEologist> and just call the name of the image
[04:53:12] <tehOPEologist> and replace the image every time someone uploads a new file
[04:53:16] <shesek> tehOPEologist, on a per-user basis I'd assume, but yes
[04:53:37] <tehOPEologist> awesome, yeah it's just to present this concept for class, so it's probably only going to be used once haha  >_<
[04:53:37] <shesek> You can use something like the user ID for the filename
[04:53:46] <tehOPEologist> that's a great idea, one moment while i try to implement that :D
[04:53:56] <tehOPEologist> thanks a bunch!  i'll come back in a little and let you know how things are going
[04:54:02] <shesek> you're learning jQuery/PHP at school ?
[04:54:50] <shesek> back when I was at school, it was all ASP, VB and really little C :-(
[04:58:36] <sedavand> why won't .change() fire when I change the value of my <input with .val('new stuff') ?
[05:04:10] <iaj> Hmm is there an easy way to replace all A hrefs that got http://www.foo.org/#abcd  with http://www.foo.org/index.php#abcd
[05:05:25] <tehOPEologist> shesek, i'm in a DB class
[05:05:30] <tehOPEologist> so we're using wordpress and the like
[05:05:45] <tehOPEologist> and i'm pretty fluent with wordpress for the most part, i've just never done something like this
[05:06:03] <tehOPEologist> and now i'm not sure how to force a name during the upload process in the php script :(  any ideas?
[05:06:47] <tehOPEologist> shesek: this is my upload script right now - http://pastebin.com/MbByABZ3
[05:07:39] <Cork> iaj: $('a[href$="#abcd"]').each(function(){ this.href = 'http://www.google.com'; });
[05:09:05] <iaj> Cork: thanks man :)
[05:09:10] <dabear> sedavand: .change is only triggered when a user changes the value, not by code
[05:10:00] <tehOPEologist> not sure where shesek went..  could anyone else help me out?
[05:10:38] <nwksystems> hi
[05:11:25] <banfidel> change line 25 to the name you want it to be
[05:11:54] <tehOPEologist> OH
[05:12:03] <tehOPEologist> so instead of the . and all the other stuff
[05:12:09] <tehOPEologist> just do "upload/preview"
[05:12:13] <banfidel> pretty much
[05:12:16] <tehOPEologist> word
[05:12:23] <tehOPEologist> what about handling different extentions?
[05:12:29] <tehOPEologist> it's only images that're being uploaded
[05:12:44] <tehOPEologist> could i just do .jpg at the end of it, and the other file-types still work?
[05:12:47] <slavka`> hey guys... i am using jquery modal... i have an element that i want to always remain on top thought... even when modal dialog has been triggered... any ideas on how i can do that?
[05:12:55] <banfidel> $ext = end(explode('.', $_FILES['blah']['name']));
[05:13:24] <jmaister> Is there an easy way to load the source of all files from a given directory into a list?
[05:13:41] <tehOPEologist> put a dot after "upload/preview" and add that before the semi-colon, and i should be good to go?
[05:14:02] <banfidel> (jmaister): using php? http://php.net/glob
[05:14:30] <jmaister> banfidel: I'm limited to using strictly client side
[05:15:05] <Cork> jmaister: http doesn't provide a way to access file listings
[05:15:11] <banfidel> (tehOPEologist): i'd do like $name = "what you want it named." . $ext;
[05:15:14] <Cork> jmaister: so client side can't do it
[05:15:40] <banfidel> (jmaister): are you wanting to list client files or server files?
[05:16:15] <tehOPEologist> banfidel: this is what i have on line 25 now: $name = "upload/prewiew" . $ext = end(explode('.', $_FILES['file']['type']));
[05:16:22] <tehOPEologist> it's saying unexpected ; >_<
[05:16:52] <jmaister> banfidel: server side, but the script is supposed to run locally
[05:17:10] <jmaister> guess I'll just have to do it manually
[05:18:04] <banfidel> http://pastebin.com/4CgDwtVC
[05:18:05] <banfidel> try that
[05:18:34] <banfidel> (jmaister): if its server side, why can't you use php?
[05:18:48] <jmaister> because it won't run on a php server
[05:18:58] <jmaister> it's supposed to run locally on a mobile device
[05:19:15] <robban666> Can somebody help me explain why this does not work? : http://jsfiddle.net/QkgFP/1/

[05:20:07] <tehOPEologist> that worked!  awesomeeeeeee

[05:20:48] <Cork> robban666: why don't you just append the li's to the ul in the loop instead of pushing it to a variable?
[05:21:49] <vmassuchetto> How can I apply a .click() event on a link that is in the HTML of an AJAX response?

[05:22:55] <Cork> parent.html(dom);
[05:23:19] <Gottflood> Ok.

[05:35:15] <Toskan> hi guys
[05:35:27] <icedwater> In the cats example here, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/, is function(data) OK because the tuple in the middle is named "data" by default?
[05:35:34] <Toskan> someone maybe knows why the default events are not processed in this example?
[05:35:36] <Toskan> http://jsfiddle.net/t26mS/24/

[05:48:58] <xec> Toskan: preventDefault is not jquery, but plain old javascript
[05:49:26] <beasty> oldskool!
[05:49:30] <xec> Toskan: and it makes sense, that if you prevent something from happening, it will not happen, yes? :)
[05:49:59] <Toskan> hehe well I mean i prevent one event, create a new one
[05:50:04] <Toskan> and the new one is prevented as well
[05:50:33] <Oldskool> beasty: you rang? ;-)
[05:50:52] <Oldskool> at least my irc client tends to think so ;p
[05:50:55] <xec> robban666: there is no property "display_name" in the business_process, but in business_process.components[0]
[05:51:48] <xec> Toskan: i'm not quite sure what you mean, could you give an example? see ?demo
[05:51:48] <bot-t> Toskan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[05:52:17] <beasty> lol no Oldskool sorry
[05:52:34] <beasty> my bad :)
[05:52:35] <Toskan> bot-t and xec http://jsfiddle.net/t26mS/26/
[05:52:41] <Oldskool> hehe, no worries
[05:53:38] <Toskan> btw i expect the form to get submitted like when you call $('test').trigger('click');
[05:53:40] <xec> Oldskool: pain to have a generic nickname, right? imagine how many ppl use the word "exec" or "execute" in here :P
[05:57:38] <Oldskool> xec: LOL ... yeah that would be worse xD
[05:58:03] <toxz> hi! i have a jquery script inside of $(document).ready... and another script for tracking from another domain. so if the tracker script is loading all my jquery scripts are not working, because the loading of the site is not completed because of the other script. any ideas on that?
[06:03:08] <icedwater> I'm trying to grab some JSON and pass it into a function, but Chrome Dev Tools tells me the request failed because "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[06:03:23] <icedwater> How may I set origin to non-null?
[06:03:27] <JT_> I have a simple plugin which does nothing useful yet - http://pastebin.com/usuJn5Rn but I'm receiving this error: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[06:04:31] <Toskan> xec under http://jsfiddle.net/t26mS/28/ i figured out that it now SOMETIMES triggers the default event when you put jquery trigger at the very bottom of the code
[06:05:15] <Toskan> so to me this seems unfixable... which is sad, custom confirm boxes would have been a blessing
[06:06:28] <JT_> Oh I know where I went wrong, I used .length() instead of .length
[06:06:38] <toxz> icedwater - isnt this a sandbox problem? you cant grab the data from a different domain, than the one where the script is running
[06:08:07] <Toskan> imho someone should put a big label on the dialog stating that it shouldnt be used as a confirmbox replacement... this was a timesink for so many people i'm sure
[06:09:20] <Cork> Toskan: uh... i use it as an alert/confirm replace ment
[06:09:24] <Cork> works grate
[06:09:49] <Toskan> well - it does maybe in easy websites where you got no big complexity
[06:10:15] <Cork> Toskan: its a big web app
[06:10:29] <Cork> its almost completly built in js
[06:10:56] <Toskan> which explains why it's a lot easier to include something like that :-)
[06:11:13] <Cork> Toskan: i don't get what you have problem with
[06:11:35] <JT_> http://pastebin.com/PuAEAr2b - I'm using setTimeout to create an interval loop - but when I use setTimeout in my rotate() function, it calls rotate() and it says it's an undefined function - why is this?
[06:11:37] <Toskan> our backend generates onclick="do something... finally... submit()"
[06:11:53] <woozly> guys, how to convert timestamp to normal human readable format?
[06:11:56] <Cork> ugg... inline events...
[06:11:57] <Toskan> this is backend generated code - we didnt write it
[06:12:13] <icedwater> toxz: I'm new to this.. so how come the example on the jQuery API works? Is it because flickr opened their API for public access?
[06:12:20] <Toskan> yeah right... so... how to solve that
[06:12:47] <Cork> Toskan: what you want is something to freez the event loop
[06:13:11] <Cork> Toskan: and ya, that doesn't work, so you need to cancle the old event, and when the user confirms trigger a new one
[06:13:14] <Toskan> yeah... or actually... to restart the event loop
[06:13:18] <Cork> *cancel
[06:13:27] <Toskan> hehe smart idea cork... i had the same
[06:13:30] <Cork> Toskan: you can't restart an event loop
[06:13:35] <Toskan> but guess what it doesn't work
[06:13:40] <Cork> but you can retrigger an event
[06:13:48] <Toskan> oh you can?
[06:13:51] <Cork> and make sure to call the dom function
[06:14:22] <Toskan> you mean (select)[0].onclick(); ?
[06:15:14] <Cork> Toskan: $('form').submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); $('#dialog')./*button*/ function() { $('form')[0].submit(); } }).submit()
[06:16:31] <Toskan> hmmm that might work cork... thanks i'll have a look whether i can change a couple things to add this
[06:16:34] <choichoi> hi
[06:17:28] <Toskan> hmm cork the problem is that our backend thinks it's a smart idea to overwrite the onclick for the submit
[06:17:39] <Toskan> e.g. the overwrite the click and then call submit from there
[06:17:47] <Cork> Toskan: don't touch the click
[06:17:56] <Cork> listen for the submit event on the form
[06:18:20] <Toskan> okay i'll give it a try
[06:18:22] <Cork> Toskan: and ya, thats one of the reasons why inline events sucks
[06:18:52] <Toskan> well for a non-javascript developer it's easier to find out what events are getting handled
[06:19:10] <Toskan> but you are right... this cost me a lot of time already
[06:20:33] <Peeter> Anyone know of any libraries that handle js object syncing with a back-end? (I've already looked at backbone)
[06:20:44] <choichoi> how can I see if a parameter change in a div for example style="width 0%;" change to 100% ?

[06:22:22] <highviews> hello guys!
[06:22:22] <highviews> can anybody help me with a jquery thing? I have lots of checkboxes, they are among groups, each group has 3 checkboxes, can you show me how can i get able to to search for groups and then find out how many checkboxes are selected among each group? Please advice, thanks!
[06:24:08] <_W_> highviews, if I wanted to help I would have responded in the channel - be polite and don't private message people to nag for help
[06:24:39] <highviews> _W_, i am sorry for that.
[06:25:14] <highviews> i am very new to this IRC thing, and not sure about the correct ways of sending messages.
[06:25:29] <highviews> i thought to send it to each user.
[06:31:00] <Mkop> highviews: can you post a partially working code sample on jsfiddle.net?
[06:31:22] <Mkop> that will help you and us figure out exactly what you're struggling with
[06:31:38] <highviews> ok
[06:31:43] <highviews> 1sc
[06:37:58] <highviews> wow, this jsfiddle.net is totally new to me
[06:48:36] <JT_> I have a set of divs, and I want them to each turn black every 3 seconds... but only 1 turns black at a time, for instance. .. the 1st div turns black, thne the 2nd turns black 3 seconds later if that makes sense... I've got the divs set up with the setTimeout 3 second loop here: http://jsfiddle.net/dCakL/8/
[06:48:43] <JT_> but as to how to do the black divs I don't really know
[06:50:43] <Silkutz> lo all
[06:51:47] <Silkutz> anyone here?
[06:51:58] <Silkutz> I had a quick question
[06:52:44] <JT_> don't ask to ask, just ask.
[06:52:53] <Silkutz> ok sorry
[06:53:26] <Mkop> JT_:
[06:53:31] <Mkop> JT_: http://jsfiddle.net/dCakL/8/
[06:53:38] <hightekvagabond> can I ask if I can ask to ask a question?
[06:53:56] <JT_> Mkop... that's the same one as I posted?
[06:54:34] <Mkop> oh. I meant http://jsfiddle.net/dCakL/9/
[06:54:34] <Narcissus> if I have a JSON object as follows: http://fpaste.org/LOs1/ assigned to the variable 'data', how can I get the values of each item, pk, model, fields etc?
[06:55:22] <JT_> Thank you Mkop, similar to what I want - though only 1 div can be black. When one turns black, the others stay white.
[06:55:47] <Silkutz> So i was wondering if there was any way to use jquery do to this : (abit like google docs) I need it so as someone types text in one textarea another person on a different browser could see what the persoan was typing. I was liking like a AJAX call every second or somting that updates a row in the db but i was wondering if there was a better way?
[06:56:18] <JT_> but .eq may be handy...
[06:57:23] <JT_> Lets say I have 8 divs, and div number 4 is black... the JS would be... var current = // grab the black div id
[06:57:34] <JT_> current would be 4,
[06:58:01] <JT_> I can then do... $("div").eq(current + 1).addClass('black');
[06:58:06] <JT_> if you get what i mean
[06:58:40] <JT_> though, div number 4, would be 3 when using eq
[06:58:43] <JT_> 0 - 7
[06:58:45] <JT_> uhm
[07:00:37] <Mkop> JT_: http://jsfiddle.net/dCakL/10/
[07:00:47] <Silkutz> So i was wondering if there was any way to use jquery do to this : (abit like google docs) I need it so as someone types text in one textarea another person on a different browser could see what the persoan was typing. I was liking like a AJAX call every second or somting that updates a row in the db but i was wondering if there was a better way?
[07:01:23] <Mkop> Silkutz: please don't ask repeatedly.......
[07:02:01] <Mkop> JT_: you need to add a bit more logic to what I did, but I think that is a good approach in general
[07:02:09] <Mkop> probably easier than keeping track of an index
[07:04:44] <Silkutz> soz mkop
[07:06:17] <JT_> great work Mkop, let me play around with this.
[07:06:33] <ablomen> Silkutz, look up websockets and socket.io
[07:07:34] <Silkutz> ablomen thanky v much
[07:07:37] <JT_> http://jsfiddle.net/dCakL/11/ almost Mkop, needs one more if statement then it'll be good.
[07:07:46] <toxz> if i have scripts included from different domains - my site is watining for the slowest one and my $(document).ready... function waits too long :-(     -   any ideas how to solve that?
[07:07:50] <JT_> How would I check if div.black is the last div?
[07:08:05] <Mkop> websockets might be a more advanced technique than Silkutz is ready for, but is a better approach than periodic ajax requests. periodic ajax requests can also work if your backend is smart enough
[07:08:41] <Mkop> JT_: look at the list of selectors on api.jquery.com, and you tell me....
[07:08:46] <Toskan> cork - the sh.... about it is that the call to (#form)[0].submit() will not invoke any event handlers. Our backend ends up calling submit()
[07:08:52] <Silkutz> so these are the two main schools of thought, periodic ajax or websockets
[07:08:56] <Ang3> hey guys  there is a chan for jqueryui ?
[07:09:00] <toxz> JT_ - use .index() and .length
[07:09:01] <Ang3> Or i can post my Q here :)
[07:09:43] <Jon47> toxz why are the scripts loading so slowly, start there
[07:10:26] <toxz> Jon47 - because they are from another domain, which i can't controll - so theres no oppinion on this side
[07:10:41] <JT_> Yeah toxz, that was my idea in the first place just wasn't sure how to do it, but now I know about index() ... another mate of mine came up with this: http://jsfiddle.net/zbADP/4/
[07:10:41] <Jon47> toxz can you load them asynchronously?
[07:10:54] <ablomen> Silkutz, sort of, and periodic ajax requests (or long polling) are not optimal, websockets are a much better solution
[07:11:12] <MrBenn> Websockets have less support though
[07:11:53] <ablomen> yeah that's why using something like socket.io is good, since it falls back on flash or other methods if websockets are not supported
[07:12:03] <MrBenn> Yeah
[07:13:11] <Silkutz> ok think im gnna try this tutorial http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/start-using-html5-websockets-today/
[07:13:23] <Silkutz> seems to be doing what i want
[07:14:32] <Silkutz> ablomen, they system im using this for a closed system that will be run on new browsers with html5 support ect etc
[07:14:41] <Silkutz> so im good there for new tech
[07:16:03] <ablomen> Silkutz, ok, be sure to check if new firefox versions have it enabled by default again
[07:16:11] <ablomen> (was disabled in ff 4)
[07:16:37] <Silkutz> ok will do
[07:17:11] <Silkutz> just out of interest, for the other way around (peroidic ajax calls) how many or how often can they be run
[07:18:06] <ablomen> Silkutz, with long polling you would keep the connection open until something happens and right after that fire a new request
[07:18:37] <ablomen> so in the backend you would just run an endless loop that only returns something when something happens
[07:19:51] <Silkutz> ablomen, Ah i see, so it that better then using setInterval or somting to fire off a request?
[07:19:55] <Jon47> as often as your server(s) can handle it..
[07:20:10] <dabear> there's also the comet approach
[07:20:26] <ablomen> sort of, but requests will time out, your server will start smoking, etc, websockets is a much nicer way to do it
[07:20:51] <Silkutz> abloment, lol yes these are issues im starting to run into
[07:21:17] <MrBenn> Think from FF 6 they are enabled by default
[07:21:28] <ablomen> MrBenn, ok cool!
[07:21:48] <Silkutz> albomen, the way ive been geting around the timeout issue is to make the server return a 500 error
[07:22:09] <dabear> ablomen: take a look into the comet approach, e.g. http://www.ape-project.org (push and pull)
[07:22:19] <Silkutz> abloment, but it still gets slow and sluggish (the browser that is)
[07:22:24] <dabear> it is implemented over websockets and ajax as a fallback
[07:22:37] <ablomen> dabear, i know comet :) never tried it though since i did not like the look of ape
[07:22:50] <MrBenn> my bad it was FF 7
[07:22:53] <MrBenn> Chrome 14, Firefox 7 and Internet Explorer 10
[07:22:56] <dabear> ablomen: there are other comet implementations
[07:23:10] <ablomen> dabear, i know, but i use socket.io + nodejs myself now :)
[07:23:19] <ablomen> thanks anyway though
[07:23:42] <Silkutz> MrBenn, think comet will do for what i need?
[07:23:51] <MrBenn> Uh never used it
[07:23:56] <icedwater> Hi, I'm testing a simple $.get() query. But I'm not sure what the problem is... $.get(url, function(data) {  alert(data)  }, "jsonp"); doesn't show me an alert, though it gets the data.
[07:24:03] <MrBenn> I've only implimented sockets with socket.io and nodejes like ablomen

[07:24:18] <tajen> hi, its it possible to user $(window).parent() ? basically, I am in an iframe, and I need to get to its containing element.. I tried, but it does not work, so looking for some sort of workaround. Thanks
[07:25:25] <tajen> and I know I can do window.parent, but I dont actually have an ID for the containing <div> element so I cant find it through another selector
[07:25:56] <ablomen> tajen, it would be $(window.parent) then
[07:26:02] <ablomen> (don't know if it works though)
[07:31:55] <JT_> http://jsfiddle.net/zbADP/6/ there we go, perfect result
[07:32:44] <JT_> On there, there is- var activediv = $(".active");  var indexdiv = $(".rotateme").index(activediv); when I could just do- var indexdiv = $(".rotateme.active").index();
[07:32:49] <JT_> Is one more recommended than the other?
[07:34:45] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? The dropdowns have a slight delay due to hoverIntent - I'm trying to get the main links to also use this delay.
[07:36:00] <dabear> JT_: no, but there are multiple flaws in your code. e.g. you think that $.rotate() starts the rotation, but that's not the case currently. see http://jsfiddle.net/zbADP/8/
[07:36:50] <JT_> yeah, I didn't code that bit... I prefer to go with the setTimeouts
[07:36:53] <JT_> im just getting it to work first
[07:36:55] <JT_> are there any other flaws?
[07:39:18] <dabear> JT_: the error isn't in the choice between settimeout cs setinterval
[07:39:41] <dabear> it's that $.rotate is a number
[07:40:01] <dabear> e.g. you are initiating the animation in the definition, the call to $.rotate() does nothing
[07:41:26] <JT_> I didn't know that, but I did know it starts without the need to call $.rotate()
[07:41:36] <dabear> and you should only have to do $(".rotateme") etc once
[07:42:20] <dabear> you shouldn't look into the document to find .rotateme once every step the animation runs
[07:42:29] <dabear> which is what's happening now
[07:42:59] <JT_> I don't understand?
[07:43:14] <dabear> what part didn't you understand?
[07:44:34] <JT_> The last 3 lines you said.
[07:44:37] <dabear> all that code is run once every second, while most can be cached ( saved to a variable) and accessed directly the following times
[07:44:56] <JT_> oh.
[07:44:58] <JT_> you mean
[07:45:09] <JT_> var rotateme = $(".rotateme"); outside of the loop?
[07:45:16] <dabear> yes
[07:45:29] <dabear> also see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring

[07:51:22] <black_warlock> who got a good regex to validate an Email ? I see milions solutions, dunno which one to select
[07:51:36] <muzone> black_warlock: There's a site for that
[07:51:43] <muzone> black_warlock: Forgot the address though
[07:51:48] <black_warlock> lol
[07:52:11] <muzone> it had tons of regexes
[07:52:20] <muzone> and showed the winner
[07:52:22] <black_warlock> just need one tested
[07:53:20] <dabear> that regex is seriously gonna be massive in size
[07:55:40] <black_warlock> "\b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b"
[07:55:42] <black_warlock> found this one
[07:55:45] <black_warlock> let me sest it
[07:56:12] <Elephant> [a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|edu|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|asia|jobs|museum)\b
[07:56:22] <black_warlock> aw it sux
[07:56:32] <Elephant> regular-expressions.info is cool imho.
[07:56:46] <black_warlock> yes but cant be like that
[07:56:53] <dabear> that regex is wrong
[07:56:59] <black_warlock> cant write all the extensions
[07:57:02] <dabear> it is too short, and it whitelists
[07:57:11] <black_warlock> you are missing many in that way
[07:57:28] <Elephant> like xxx?
[07:57:42] <black_warlock> like.us or .uk
[07:57:50] <black_warlock> or many many others
[07:57:51] <dabear> here is the correct regex
[07:57:52] <dabear> http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
[07:57:56] <NoiseEee> checking for valid email addresses shouldn't be designated to JS
[07:57:56] <Elephant> that one does all two letter countries
[07:58:03] <dabear> seriously, validating emails is shit hard
[07:58:07] <black_warlock> infact im not using on js
[07:58:11] <dabear> and that's the proper solution
[07:58:14] <black_warlock> but serverside validation
[07:58:38] <JT_> dabear, I know a bit about plugins -- atleast the ones i've made do work, but I'll take a look at the link and see where I can improve
[07:59:10] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? The dropdowns have a slight delay due to hoverIntent - I'm trying to get the main links to also use this delay.
[07:59:19] <dabear> JT_: when you are doing $.foo = ... you are basically writing a reusable module ( = a plugin)
[07:59:41] <dabear> JT_: so it should be callable, or else you shouldn't use that notation
[08:00:08] <dabear> e.g. $.rotate shouldn't be used if you can't reuse the rotation later on another element in the same page
[08:00:33] <dabear> e.g. mutliple rotations should be as easy as doing $.rotate() twice with different parameters
[08:00:35] <Muimi> hello.  I'm having trouble getting the "hello world" example to work in jquery.  I click on the link and receive no popup.

[08:02:10] <sammi> Hi All, I'm trying to implement a modal dialog with bootstrap from twitter. I have a simple php script that lists out all jpegs in a directory as shown here: http://atlas.lmi.is/loftm/1.php . I want to send data to a modal dialog when a picture is clicked (picture file name in this case). What is the common practice ? do I use query.bind() ?
[08:02:36] <dabear> Muimi: YOU NEED TO PASTE
[08:02:53] <Muimi> For 2 lines?
[08:03:00] <dabear> Muimi: because that should work, given that you also have loaded jquery
[08:03:05] <lodott> I am trying to simulate AJAX via /echo/json/ and. ajax, but only get an empty array: http://jsfiddle.net/kuni/Hdxbz/ , function sendForm() for the call and click Step 1 in results for the current state
[08:03:06] <JT_> I stopped doing $.foo for random functions, but it failed to work - look here: http://jsfiddle.net/zMZjV/ it says "ok" once, then it stops... an error states "rotate() is not defined" ?
[08:03:10] <Muimi> Yeah it works.  My bad.
[08:03:12] <primitive> does anyone know how I could edit a jCarousel in order to get it to be more continuous like it is on http://one.org/us
[08:03:13] <JT_> which is why I went with $.foo as that worked o.O
[08:03:26] <primitive> jCarousel is at http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[08:03:39] <Muimi> Linked wrongly in the script tag.
[08:03:46] <uchuff> anyone know how to have the JQuery UI datepicker not have a date selected by default?
[08:04:12] <dabear> JT_: it's a bug in jsfiddle. gotta do window.rotate or better: setTimeout(rotate, 3000);
[08:04:38] <JT_> it's not just jsfiddle, I had the same issue without jsfiddle.
[08:05:16] <JT_> but yeah, that did work.
[08:05:41] <JT_> why can't I do setTimeout(rotate(), 3000); ? Well, I can but... it doesn't actually wait 3 seconds
[08:06:45] <Pilate> because youre invoking the function instead of passing it as a parm
[08:06:46] <Muimi> Ahhhhh.  Harmony.  The search dog is sleeping in Explorer.
[08:06:47] <NoiseEee> JT_: you're executing it right away with ()
[08:06:56] <Muimi> Thank you.
[08:07:03] <JT_> Ah, okay NoiseEee

[08:09:49] <Layke> If a plugin I'm trying to use declares a function, like  $.Indextank.AjaxSearch how do I actually use it?
[08:10:02] <muzone> god damnit
[08:10:11] <Layke>  $.Indextank.AjaxSearch = function(){} sorry.
[08:17:44] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  Using the Validation plugin, is it possible to pass variables to the methods via inline classes?  i.e. class="required:#checkbox:checked"?
[08:18:04] <lodott> gah, found it myself: I used method:post instead of type:post in the .ajax call
[08:18:06] <joshsmith> if I have a javascript object named params, with the property 'links' with an array of strings, how can I get the length of that array?
[08:18:17] <joshsmith> I've tried using params.links.length but it say it's undefined
[08:19:02] <MarcGuay> joshsmith: console.log(params) and see what's going on?
[08:19:32] <woozly> guys, how to output timestamp to human readable?
[08:19:33] <joshsmith> that works fine, and console.log(params.links) also shows that it's an array ['string', 'string']
[08:20:00] <yogurt_truck> joshsmith: params.links.length is the right way, if you actually had what you say you have (a params object with an array property that's an array)
[08:21:26] <joshsmith> yogurt_truck: I have: var params = { links:  [ 'interest955', 'interest956' ] }
[08:21:46] <joshsmith> I'm guessing that's wrong somehow
[08:22:35] <lodott> woozly: new Date(1000* unix_ts) should give you the Date object to the timestamp
[08:23:20] <yogurt_truck> joshsmith: that's good, but where and when are you trying to access params.links.length? params is defined _somewhere_ in the code but probably after the code that's trying to access it
[08:23:23] <woozly> lodott, thank you!
[08:23:53] <joshsmith> yogurt_truck: it's working now, and I didn't change anything. that's odd
[08:24:32] <joshsmith> maybe I forgot to save before running... :/
[08:24:50] <joshsmith> well, gracias, nonetheless

[08:28:48] <muzone> but the wire is way better
[08:28:50] <nodestool> i am trying to use $.live() function, i want to bind my function only after the element is complete, like $("fooo.div").live('something??',function(){ $(this).attr('foo','bar'); }
[08:28:54] <muzone> aint that right?
[08:29:02] <nodestool> what would be the "something??" to bind too
[08:30:31] <nodestool> the docs says "events" but i don't know where the list and description of "events" i s
[08:30:43] <Narcissus> I have this JSON object: http://fpaste.org/THKg/ and this jQuery: http://fpaste.org/DeIm/ however the JSON object is treated as though it is a string, what can I do to change this?
[08:32:23] <yogurt_truck> muzone: pretty different beasts, breaking bad is a hard things-go-fucking-wrong-all-the-time drama, and The Wire was more of a huge all-encompassing project with a strong journalistic veracity
[08:32:49] <muzone> hehe
[08:32:54] <muzone> well said man!!
[08:34:20] <nodestool> Narcissus: did you try just alert(data[0][model]) or something to make sure its not a problem with USER?
[08:35:08] <timmstokke> In a loop, I know parts of an <input>'s name - ie: "title", with the the name being name="data[Article][title]" OR just name="title". How would I go about selecting the inputs?
[08:35:28] <Narcissus> nodestool: yep, I tried it - model is not defined, and [0] return a [
[08:35:52] <timmstokke> I'm sure the answer lies in regexp, which I completely suck at. Anyone feeling helpful? :)
[08:37:10] <nodestool> Narcissus: i actually dont' use the shorthand ajax functions, i normally just use $.ajax({}) so i might not be much help.
[08:37:16] <jbeach> timmstokke, can you do something like $('[name="title"')?
[08:37:33] <Narcissus> nodestool: can you use ajax crossdomain?
[08:38:45] <nodestool> Narcissus: depends on what you mean, but cross domain is just normal javascript stuff, jquery makes no changes for that
[08:38:53] <timmstokke> jbeach, sure, but won't that only match when name="title" and not when it's name="data[Article][title]" ?
[08:39:39] <nodestool> timmstokke: what are you trying to match?
[08:39:56] <Narcissus> nodestool: well I'm using JSONP in order to get the JSON from a different server - which works, I get the JSON wrapped in an instance of the jQuery object object I want to execute on callback. But it still treats the JSON as a string
[08:40:32] <timmstokke> <input name="data[Article][title]"> OR <input name="title">
[08:40:34] <nodestool> Narcissus: there is jsonp type in $.ajax() are you user thats not what you want to use?
[08:41:01] <SudoKing> how should i serialize this to send it with $.post() ? as it is it sends [object Object] -- adata = $('input:checkbox:checked').map(function(i,n) {return {'extra': $(n).attr('extra')}; }).get();
[08:41:29] <sunscreen> whats the maximum size in bytes you would return from a ajax request?
[08:41:34] <nodestool> dataType:'jsonp'
[08:41:39] <timmstokke> Narcissus: is the Content-Type: application/jsonp ?
[08:42:18] <Narcissus> timmstokke: no, it's application/json
[08:42:49] <nodestool> sunscreen: that is application specific.
[08:42:57] <dialup> does someone know an editable multi line <select> plugin?
[08:43:43] <joshsmith> what am I doing wrong here with the nested array http://pastebin.com/NaAhXEew
[08:43:45] <timmstokke> Narcissus: ups, yeah, that's what is should be. Sure the Content-Type is returned correctly? Test with var $responseHeader = jqxhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');
[08:44:54] <Narcissus> timmstokke: the Content-Type is returned correctly (when checking using the firebug NET tab)
[08:45:04] <Narcissus> I've tried $.parseJSON, and I get a JSON object now
[08:45:14] <nodestool> joshsmith: no , on line 2?
[08:45:27] <joshsmith> nodestool: rofl. thanks
[08:46:04] <joshsmith> here I am writing some complex node package and I can't even find a missing comma...

[08:47:20] <JT_> dabear, var index = linkImg.hasClass("active").index(); hasClass obviously returns a true or false ... but do you see what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to grab the index of the image that has a class active
[08:47:22] <sunscreen> s/wouuld think
[08:48:14] <dabear> JT_: .filter(".active")
[08:48:20] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/26/ (simple dropdown menu) - how do I make the main links return to black at the same time the dropdown disappears? The dropdowns have a slight delay due to hoverIntent - I'm trying to get the main links to also use this delay.
[08:48:41] <supsup> muzone ? http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/66/
[08:48:48] <dabear> JT_: or filter( function(){ return this.className.indexOf("active")+1 })
[08:51:36] <muzone> supsup: interesting!!
[08:51:43] <supsup> well still a problem tho
[08:51:50] <supsup> background gets changed on children also sometimes
[08:51:54] <supsup> so u will need to look intot hat
[08:52:19] <muzone> what is meant by .css("background", "#ddd").find("a:first").css("background", "#ddd");
[08:52:28] <muzone> i mean.. saying the same thing twice..
[08:52:37] <supsup> you have css rules on both the top level lis
[08:52:41] <supsup> and the Ancor tags
[08:52:44] <muzone> oh yeah, i think that is solved by setting  $("#main-menu li").hoverIntent({ to  $("#main-menu > li").hoverIntent({
[08:52:57] <supsup> so u have to first fix the css of the LI then the ancor tag
[08:53:03] <supsup> the first ancor tag of this
[08:53:48] <supsup> so set this (the li you hovered over) css.  then find its first ancor tag child, and also fix it's css
[08:53:49] <muzone> i dont know.. its gotta be a simpler, more beautiful way dont u think?
[08:53:53] <muzone> still supercool what u did though bro
[08:54:01] <muzone> i thank you from the bottom of my heart
[08:54:39] <supsup> sure it could be improved to not use find and instead us a selector directly.  but then i think it would be two lines
[08:54:56] <supsup> jquery object selector
[08:55:01] <muzone> never heard of those..
[08:55:33] <supsup> you use them all the time. I prob am not saying their name right, it's just a selector.
[08:55:33] <muzone> and var $myHover = $(this); .. can't i just use $(this)?
[08:55:51] <muzone> ah i see.. well.. because someone in here earlier said "check your selectors"
[08:55:57] <supsup> $(".someselector")  vs .find(".someselector")
[08:55:59] <muzone> i was like huh? and then he stopped responding.. hehe
[08:57:06] <SudoKing> how do i post the value of .map().text() ?
[08:58:42] <muzone> supsup: u rock man thanks a lot
[08:58:55] <supsup> np
[09:02:37] <muzone> supsup: what u think man any way to simplify / beautify this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/67/
[09:04:23] <muzone> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/70/ sorry
[09:04:46] <supsup> maybe 1 line instead of 4.
[09:04:50] <supsup> just chain it all
[09:05:12] <muzone> cool
[09:05:33] <muzone> theres no way i can do multiple css selectors in one jquery selector?
[09:05:39] <muzone> assuming i got the meaning of the word selector right here

I'm working on a "add to cart" function that onclick takes the button and animates it to the position of the cart to let the user see the product is going to the cart. I'm using this function right now: http://pastebin.com/55JezkMe, but I would really love to improve the animation, so it's like a parabola. Any way of doing that?

[09:16:30] <natrixnatrix89> hi guys.. can anyone explain to me how does animate() work..
[09:16:41] <natrixnatrix89> it isnt using setTimeout or setInterval() ?
[09:16:44] <natrixnatrix89> right?
[09:16:46] <natrixnatrix89> or is it?
[09:17:08] <natrixnatrix89> i mean because when the pc hangs.. the time of the animation still is the same and uses less fps..
[09:17:13] <JT_> No, animate simply animates from one style, to another.
[09:17:27] <natrixnatrix89> but how?
[09:17:52] <natrixnatrix89> ok.. i'll just read the source then..
[09:19:41] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yt?
[09:20:11] <natrixnatrix89> hmm jquery speed? how does that work?
[09:20:38] <JT_> natrixnatrix89: http://jsfiddle.net/nqzRB/1/
[09:20:55] <JT_> 5000 is in milliseconds and it means 5 seconds. So it takes 5 seconds to animate from 200px height, to 50px height

[09:21:51] <jaffipaffi> Anyone?
[09:21:56] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: sup
[09:22:11] <khmer> natrixnatrix89: the inner loop uses setInterval
[09:22:23] <natrixnatrix89> khmer:
[09:22:26] <natrixnatrix89> khmer: thanks
[09:22:33] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I was wondering if you know of anyone who is writing another jquery cookbook? Or even a jquery-ui cookbook?
[09:22:36] <natrixnatrix89> khmer: that's exacltly what i wanted to know
[09:22:38] <Muimi> Can someone explain this to me: "When the search for the span selector is restricted to the context of this, only spans within the clicked element will get the additional class.  Internally, selector context is implemented with the .find() method, so $('span', this) is equivalent to $(this).find('span')."
[09:23:00] <Toskan> hello
[09:23:08] <DCD> Hello
[09:23:17] <Muimi> "only spans within the clicked element" is the phrase I am troubled by.
[09:23:21] <Toskan> does someone know why icons are not supported on <input type="submit" ? will they eventually get supported?
[09:23:49] <Toskan> e.g. "When using an input of type button, submit or reset, support is limited to plain text labels with no icons." from the api docs
[09:23:51] <jbeach> timmstokke, sorry to disappear, yes
[09:24:04] <jbeach> try this: $('[name*="title")')
[09:24:09] <natrixnatrix89> khmer: what interval is it using by default?
[09:24:20] <jbeach> $('[name*="title"]')
[09:24:23] <jbeach> correction
[09:24:24] <timmstokke> jbeach: ty, will try
[09:24:25] <khmer> natrixnatrix89: 1ms
[09:24:33] <khmer> natrixnatrix89: which in browser timeslices is 15ms :)
[09:24:43] <jbeach> attribute selectors have a bunch of comparitors
[09:24:45] <jbeach> *=
[09:24:47] <natrixnatrix89> and what happens if the pc hangs then?
[09:24:47] <jbeach> $=
[09:24:57] <jbeach> ^=, |=
[09:25:14] <natrixnatrix89> does it check the time delta or sth?
[09:25:28] <supsup> muzone: also u an just chain the commands instead of using extra lines. http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/75/
[09:25:30] <timmstokke> jbeach: worked like a charm, thank you!
[09:26:05] <khmer> natrixnatrix89: dunno!
[09:26:13] <jbeach> timmstokke, great! here are more details if you're interested http://css-tricks.com/5591-attribute-selectors/
[09:26:43] <natrixnatrix89> hmm. reading the jquery source.. but dont completely understand it :/
[09:28:31] <gnarf> jbeach: one of those attr selectors isn't CSS specification fyi - i don't remember which
[09:28:34] <gnarf> might be !=
[09:29:37] <timmstokke> Thanks jbeach, that helps a great deal!
[09:31:28] <_julian__> hi
[09:31:38] <DCD> Anyone have advice on dynamic fields, specifically a drop down box? I run a function based upon the selected value, but it changes all of my fields and not just that row.
[09:31:53] <_julian__> is it possible to do a unwrap only when a previous wrap with a specific element type (a a-tag this time) was done?
[09:32:09] <_julian__> somethink like if parent = a then unwrap?
[09:34:05] <jbeach> gnarf, ah, good to keep in mind, thx
[09:34:45] <Muimi> what's a span within a clicked element?
[09:35:24] <ajpiano> Muimi: a clicked element is "the element that was just clicked and that you're in the event handler function for"
[09:35:48] <ajpiano> a span within that is .... a span that's inside of that element
[09:35:59] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: i don't offhand, why
[09:36:02] <DCD> I've got dynamic fields working. I've got the calculations working. But when I add a new field and select the item, my calculation function updates the new field and all previous ones.
[09:36:24] <Muimi> You mean span of <a><span></span></a> and nothing more?
[09:36:39] <ajpiano> Muimi: yes
[09:36:47] <Muimi> Why use generic terminology, then?
[09:36:59] <ajpiano> because you can have a click handler on any element, not just an <a>
[09:37:26] <Muimi> I see.  I haven't done that.  No wonder it seems so odd.
[09:37:36] <Muimi> Do you know where I could find an example?
[09:37:54] <Muimi> Or could you show me one in short?
[09:38:12] <_julian__> I tried to it like this: $("#"+$element_id).wrap('<a class=".awrap" href=""></a>');, then do: $(".awrap").children().unwrap();
[09:38:17] <_julian__> but nothing is unwrapped in this case
[09:39:04] <ajpiano> <div class='foo'><span>bar</span></div> $(".foo").click( function(e) { console.log( $(this).find("span");  } );
[09:39:07] <ajpiano> Muimi: ^^
[09:41:05] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I thought I might want to contribute to something like that
[09:41:07] <Muimi> Oh.  So you use jquery to place a click event onto .foo and its descendants.  All of the descendant 'span' attributes are effected by the jquery, and the ancestors are not?
[09:41:33] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: you should just contribute to the jquery learning site, which is basically the same idea
[09:41:45] <ajpiano> only that it's free and then you can link people to it from here
[09:41:45] <ajpiano> :D
[09:41:55] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: well...then... fine...then
[09:42:20] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: on github I take it? (to lazy to look)
[09:42:32] <ajpiano> github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com
[09:42:35] <majackson> hi guys, is there any way of animating a slideDown() (or similar) where in every step of the animation, the css specifying the size change is set with an `!important` flag (so as to override another !important on the page, which I have no control over)?
[09:43:12] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:43:13] <ryanneufeld> thx
[09:43:19] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: we might be seriously changing some of the tech solution there, but the content is the content and is badly in need of a round of editing
[09:43:21] <ajpiano> <-- my job
[09:43:31] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: cool
[09:43:38] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I'll take a look this evening
[09:45:07] <Muimi> ajpiano, is that link for me?
[09:45:25] <ajpiano> Muimi: not really
[09:45:39] <ajpiano> Muimi: you might get more mileage out of see ?jqf
[09:45:39] <bot-t> Muimi, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[09:45:57] <Muimi> I think I'll use them both.
[09:46:22] <ajpiano> or the place where that site is currently staged, http://stage.learn.jquery.com
[09:46:24] <jomofcw> The topic isn't uptodate : 1.7.1
[09:46:36] <Muimi> I'm concerned that I won't be able to post data to my page via jquery, and I'll only be able to post data to alerts, as I follow along with the official jquery tutorials.
[09:46:46] <Muimi> Hopefully they're surprise me.
[09:47:03] <Muimi> I wish that they were more functional and communicative.
[09:47:55] <ajpiano> Muimi: you shouldn't expect bite-size samples in the documentation to present full-fledged scenarios
[09:48:37] <majackson> anyone got any ideas about my !important animation question ?
[09:48:46] <ajpiano> Muimi: the jqfundamentals book, as well  as see ?101
[09:48:46] <bot-t> Muimi, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[09:48:52] <ajpiano> will be useful

[09:49:03] <ajpiano> the first link i sent is basically the book in the process of evolving into a new site
[09:49:40] <tonyjcamp> ajpiano: the learn.jquery site looks rad. When did you put that up?
[09:49:50] <ajpiano> THE FUTURE tonyjcamp
[09:49:56] <Muimi> Yes, I'm currently in the middle of that book.  It's adequate.  The writer has talent.
[09:50:01] <tonyjcamp> *shiver*
[09:50:30] <tonyjcamp> Well done sir.
[09:50:58] <ajpiano> 'taint ready yet, it's part of us trying to get all the web properties up to date
[09:51:31] <Muimi> Evolving into a new site, huh?
[09:51:53] <Muimi> it sounds like I'm becoming a better human being.
[09:51:59] <ajpiano> yah
[09:52:38] <Muimi> Thanks, again.  So much help, today. :)  So useful.
[09:55:41] <icedwater> Is the author of that book here?
[09:55:53] <ajpiano> she is
[09:56:05] <ajpiano> so is the maintainer
[09:56:57] <tonyjcamp> They're awesome people
[10:00:55] <gho5t> I need to find a div with a class name of "dialog" that is in the same contanier my button is. when clicked I call this but it doesn't work I think because of chaining. what's the right way to do this? $(this).closest('.tile').find('.dialog1').dialog('open');
[10:04:58] <gnarf> ajpiano: did they finally solve that deployment issue with learn?
[10:05:16] <ajpiano> yeah we got that straightened out
[10:05:30] <ajpiano> it looks like we might be moving to a very diff deploy strategies
[10:07:10] <gho5t> I need to find a div with a class name of "dialog" that is in the same contanier my button is. when clicked I call this but it doesn't work I think because of chaining. what's the right way to do this? $(this).closest('.tile').find('.dialog1').dialog('open');
[10:09:21] <adrian|home> As of jQuery 1.7 onwards, what's the best route for attaching events to DOM elements which don't exist yet
[10:09:32] <tonyjcamp> gho5t: sounds like you might need .next()
[10:09:35] <ajpiano> .on
[10:10:12] <adrian|home> ajpiano: I thought so. thanks.... I must be using it incorrectly because it's only working for "current" DOM elements.
[10:10:26] <ajpiano> adrian|home: it's not a drop-in replacement for .llive
[10:10:43] <ajpiano> adrian|home: you'd be best to disabuse yourself of the notion of "attaching events to elements that don't exist yet"
[10:11:02] <ajpiano> what you're really doing with live/delegate/on is "using event bubbling to catch events higher in the DOM than the element on which they occurred"
[10:11:20] <gho5t> tonjcamp: gets the immediate next sibling. i don't think that helps
[10:11:46] <ajpiano> which happens to have the happy side effect of allowing you to catch events on things that weren't in the DOM when you initially bound the handler
[10:11:49] <adrian|home> ajpiano: well, technically yes. One cannot bind events to elements that don't exist yet. There's nothing to bind to, so something else needs to catch the event and do a "lazy/late" check.
[10:12:11] <ajpiano> ok, sounds like you know the deal then :)
[10:12:35] <gho5t> I need to find a div with a class name of "dialog" that is in the same contanier my button is. when clicked I call this but it doesn't work I think because of chaining. what's the right way to do this? $(this).closest('.tile').find('.dialog1').dialog('open');
[10:13:00] <ajpiano> gho5t: fyi no one else here knows your DOM structure and cannot possibly genuinely intuit what the right traversal path will be without seeing the HTML
[10:13:12] <gho5t> no i'm not asking that
[10:13:31] <supsup> I know it i know his dom structure it's a secret tho
[10:13:35] <gho5t> i need to find .dialog1 within the div.tile that the button is clicked
[10:13:50] <gho5t> and on .dialog1 i need to do .dialog('open')
[10:13:58] <gho5t> $(this).closest('.tile').find('.dialog1').dialog('open');
[10:14:00] <supsup> ? jsfiddle.net
[10:14:01] <bot-t> supsup, #9120 (internet explorer 7 bug at Line 16 Sign 12789)  jQuery Core ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9120
[10:14:02] <gho5t> this is in the button click method
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> assuming you are finding your way to that element properly and it already is a jquery ui dialog, your code should work
[10:14:31] <supsup> prob ur calling your code before the dom loads your divs/whatevers
[10:14:46] <gho5t> i was wondering if when i do .find('.dialog1').dialog('open') is it actually calling dialog('open') on the button
[10:14:51] <gho5t> because of chaning?
[10:14:53] <supsup> which means the length of all ur stuff is 0.
[10:15:00] <adrian|home> ajpiano: the penny has just dropped. I can't use a selector for an element that doesn't exist yet :) hence why my .on delegation doesn't work :D
[10:15:09] <ajpiano> adrian|home: woot
[10:15:16] <adrian|home> even though I knew what was going on, my code didn't make sense.
[10:15:27] <gho5t> supsup: it's in document.ready
[10:15:44] <supsup> gho5t make jsfiddle example
[10:15:54] <gho5t> ok
[10:20:39] <Narcissus> can anyone exoplain why http://jsfiddle.net/PbMde/ works fine (text boxes empty on focus) on JSFiddle, but as a standalone, it doesn't?
[10:21:14] <Eviltwin> What doesn't work in the standalone?
[10:21:29] <Narcissus> the text boxes don't empty on focus
[10:21:52] <Eviltwin> Do you have Firebug or something that lets you catch errors?
[10:21:53] <gho5t> supsup:  http://jsfiddle.net/VdY8d/
[10:22:07] <Narcissus> Eviltwin: yes, and afaik, there are none
[10:22:12] <Narcissus> I've tried console logging everywhere
[10:22:13] <supsup> your using an id
[10:22:17] <supsup> and then a class as a selector
[10:22:43] <gho5t> yeah whoops
[10:22:47] <gho5t> just fixed it and updated it
[10:23:02] <gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/VdY8d/1/
[10:24:00] <Eviltwin> Narcissus: Try adding this in your standalone: http://jsfiddle.net/PbMde/1/
[10:24:04] <Eviltwin> Those logs
[10:24:50] <njckname> I want to create a function that does an AJAX request and then returns the server's result, I know how to do the AJAX request but I don't know how to return the server's response. Here is the basic function, what do I execute on success or in the callback function of $.ajax? http://pastie.org/2934546
[10:25:03] <njckname> the server's response*
[10:25:21] <tonyjcamp> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/VdY8d/3/
[10:25:25] <Narcissus> Eviltwin: I get no logs... :/
[10:25:26] <tonyjcamp> is this what you wanted.
[10:25:41] <supsup> yep tony got it u had a . in wrong place also
[10:25:43] <Eviltwin> Narcissus: Then looks like that code's not running or you aren't loading jQuery or something
[10:25:55] <Eviltwin> njckname: Have you done asynchronous programming before?
[10:26:00] <njckname> Yes
[10:26:03] <supsup> and you did not have jquery selected in left side
[10:26:05] <gho5t> tonyjcamp: yes. thanks. is next() the same thing as siblings()
[10:26:16] <Eviltwin> njckname: $.ajax is asynchronous, "success" is one of the callback functions
[10:26:24] <njckname> Yes, I know.
[10:26:24] <Eviltwin> It's how you get the data
[10:26:42] <Eviltwin> IF you're asking for a function that waits until the server has responded and then returns
[10:26:45] <Eviltwin> That's not possible
[10:27:18] <deed02392> It's also a bad idea, Eviltwin
[10:27:19] <doktorj> eviltwin!
[10:27:20] <njckname> Well, say you don't know how to do it right away, don't preach
[10:27:20] <Narcissus> Eviltwin: I mistyped text/javascript >_<
[10:27:30] <tonyjcamp> gho5t: I'm not 100% sure, but I think .siblings will select all of the siblings… even traverse upwards. .next might only go down.
[10:27:36] <Eviltwin> Narcissus: You'll need to do this: http://pastie.org/2934575
[10:27:43] <gho5t> ok
[10:27:46] <Eviltwin> Err
[10:27:49] <doktorj> i lost what you told me the other day about getting an array out of a group of text areas with a certain class and have been trying for a long time again
[10:27:53] <Eviltwin> njckname: You'll need to do this: http://pastie.org/2934575
[10:27:55] <supsup> ? .next()
[10:27:56] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[10:27:56] <doktorj> is it something like: $(":text.psaInputs").each(function(index){ console.log($(this)[index]; });  ?
[10:28:14] <doktorj> i'd prefer coffeescript by jquer yis find
[10:28:26] <njckname> I thought about that solution myself but I don't like it. Thanks anyway
[10:28:27] <Eviltwin> njckname: And instead of var response=getServerResponse(data); ...; you'll do getServerResponse(data,function(){...})
[10:28:35] <Eviltwin> njckname: There is no other solution though
[10:28:38] <deed02392> I want to integrate a live webcam stream from my PC into a web page, how can I do this?
[10:28:51] <njckname> I'll show you an alternative in a minute, it's ugly but might work
[10:29:41] <supsup> ajpiano : do you use/used coffeescript?
[10:29:50] <ajpiano> nope
[10:29:52] <njckname> Eviltwin, actually my alternative solution wouldn't work well
[10:29:56] <njckname> damn
[10:30:14] <Eviltwin> doktorj: I think I told you $('.grid_5.omega.date .hasDatePicker').map(function(){return $(this).val();})
[10:30:18] <Eviltwin> If my logs aren't lying to me
[10:30:35] <Eviltwin> Unless that was the other guy's
[10:30:43] <doktorj> thanks!
[10:31:19] <Eviltwin> njckname: JavaScript only lets one function run at a time
[10:31:32] <Eviltwin> njckname: They've made it intentionally difficult for you to do certain slow things synchronously
[10:31:40] <Eviltwin> Because it would be bad if you did
[10:31:47] <Eviltwin> It would make your website totally unresponsive
[10:32:04] <Eviltwin> By not allowing you to do what you're trying to do, they're forcing you to design better
[10:36:38] <domcat> any recommendation for a jQuery timer that can start, stop and also pause the timer? I find this older plugin, which works good, but I miss the pause feature there http://jquery.offput.ca/every/
[10:39:14] <doktorj> eviltwin: phew - you saved my day again, i wrote it down this time
[10:39:22] <doktorj> thank-you.

[10:44:05] <supsup> i have a lot of work to do here but i just want to play with nodejs what should I do?
[10:45:56] <tomasm-> hi, im trying to use jquery.post() and was wondering how do i go about serializing a form into a data structure/object instead of a string?
[10:46:32] <supsup> ? .serialize()
[10:46:32] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:46:44] <tomasm-> $('form').serialize() creates a STRING, i want an OBJECT
[10:46:46] <supsup> just use .ajax instead of post
[10:46:58] <supsup> ~~
[10:47:09] <ajpiano> ?g jquery serialize object plugin ben alman @ tomasm-
[10:47:09] <pjeweb> Any idea how i could have a sortable ul > li > button where li's are sortable and buttons starts sorting?
[10:47:10] <bot-t> tomasm-, Ben Alman  jQuery Misc plugins - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[10:47:33] <ajpiano> tomasm-: https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.js
[10:48:26] <tomasm-> ajpiano, i really do fail to see why that was excluded from the core, seems so essential
[10:48:55] <ajpiano> it wasn't excluded, it just hasn't been included
[10:49:00] <ajpiano> yet
[10:49:28] <ajpiano> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/22/call-for-jquery-1-8-ideas/
[10:51:22] <tomasm-> ajpiano, that code is nearly 2 years old, and i dont see anything on that page mentioning it
[10:51:22] <supsup> what is the most common case for wanting to serialize a form into an object?  for json passing/validation etc?
[10:51:44] <ajpiano> tomasm-: it still works, and that blog post was "call for submissions" not "here'a a list of things we're putting in 1.8"
[10:51:57] <ajpiano> supsup: i do it a lot in backbone apps
[10:53:02] <supsup> ok thanks just odd i've never run into a case where i've needed to, but it seems like a common problem.
[10:53:05] <ajpiano> you want to add more data to the object, you aren't actually posting a form at all
[10:53:07] <foRei> Hey guys, im trying to make this: http://nerdcave.dk/design.png - Can you point me in the right direction as to what jquery functions I need (preferable tutorials/pages to read) =)
[10:53:23] <supsup> ok
[10:53:25] <foRei> - I have all the images for the buttons etc
[10:55:22] <tomasm-> ajpiano, how come load() was coded to take in an object as POST mode when coming up with that object in the first place is not something so easily done?
[10:55:42] <pjeweb> jQ UI: How can I make the buttons start the sorting/dragging of its parent li not the li itself? (http://jsfiddle.net/yHF4H/)
[10:56:06] <ajpiano> tomasm-: because it's perfectly easy to come up with that object assuming you don't want to serialize a form into an object
[10:56:12] <ajpiano> but just want to pass along arbitrary k/v pairs
[10:56:50] <tomasm-> possible but i doubt it's commonness. i added a comment to that wishlist, btw. so i'll stop complaining. =P
[10:57:09] <tomasm-> common relative to serializing a form as an object, that is
[10:57:33] <photosbyme> I am using bxSlider and one of the options is pagerActiveClass i want to attach the following event, when a user hover over it i want it the opacity to be 1
[10:58:28] <ajpiano> tomasm-: can you submit it via the form linked in the second paragraph instead of the comments
[10:58:33] <hypeBoy> can any one help me preventing default action on events in plain javascript?
[10:58:37] <photosbyme> http://bxslider.com/options
[10:59:53] <Eviltwin> hypeBoy: Sure
[11:00:08] <Eviltwin> hypeBoy: In your event listener, the first argument is the event
[11:00:16] <Eviltwin> On that object, call .preventDefault()
[11:00:24] <jbrokc> so i'm having trouble where .delegate() doesn't respond to a particular parent for some reason, but once I change the parent to "body" and the selector to parent + "selector", it then works. besides having to modify all my selectors, what alternative to do I have to ammend this?
[11:00:34] <supsup> pjeweb: not sure what you mean.   there is only one li i see in your html so not sure about this parent li stuff your talking about.
[11:01:13] <Eviltwin> jbrokc: Can you explain a little further? Give more specifics / an example?
[11:01:41] <pjeweb> So the markup looks like that: ul > li > button and the button should start the dragging of ITS parent = li
[11:02:49] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: um, sure. $("#foo").delegate("a.some_class", 'click', function(e) { console.log('never fires for some reason') });. but changed to $("body").delegate("#foo a.some_class", "click", function(e) { console.log('it works!') });
[11:03:07] <Eviltwin> jbrokc: Does #foo exist when you run that code?
[11:03:15] <pjeweb> yep
[11:03:27] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: I thought .delegate() acted like .live()
[11:03:38] <Eviltwin> Sort of, it's a little different
[11:03:42] <Eviltwin> I'll explain
[11:03:44] <sunscreen> $("#textareacontent").focus(function () { console.log("hey"); } );   <-- fails to trigger
[11:03:46] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[11:03:47] <Eviltwin> Since I've had to do it a dozen or so times now
[11:03:51] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: aw, sorry
[11:03:56] <Eviltwin> Normally when you select something
[11:03:58] <Eviltwin> It's static
[11:04:09] <Eviltwin> Like $("a").bind("click",function(){...})
[11:04:19] <Eviltwin> That only applies to the A tags that currently exist
[11:04:42] <Eviltwin> Now $("a").live("click",function(){...}) applies to all current and future A tags
[11:04:46] <devOlsen> sunscreen is that textarea in the dom on page load?
[11:04:46] <Eviltwin> But the syntax is very misleading
[11:04:49] <devOlsen> or added afterwards?
[11:05:04] <Eviltwin> It pretends that $("a") is a dynamic collection
[11:05:04] <sunscreen> Eviltwin,  nope
[11:05:10] <Eviltwin> But it isn't
[11:05:24] <sunscreen> i create it onclick of a another button
[11:05:24] <Eviltwin> So what delegate does is make everything clearer
[11:05:34] <Eviltwin> You start with a static collection
[11:05:39] <Eviltwin> Like $("#foo")
[11:05:47] <Eviltwin> And you bind a .delegate with a selector in it
[11:05:51] <devOlsen> change focus to live('focus',function(){}.... sunscreen.
[11:05:59] <Eviltwin> Like .delegate("a","click",function(){...})
[11:06:09] <Eviltwin> There are actually two selectors in play
[11:06:15] <Eviltwin> One is static and one is dynamic
[11:06:32] <Eviltwin> $("[static]").delegate("[dynamic]","click",function(){...})
[11:06:37] <Eviltwin> For .live it's all dynamic
[11:06:41] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: fyi - my standard WWF pace is like one move per 2 days
[11:06:52] <Eviltwin> And to emulate $("[dynamic]").live("click",function(){...})
[11:06:58] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ah, fair enough lol
[11:07:04] <Eviltwin> You should do $(document).delegate("[dynamic]","click",function(){...})
[11:07:04] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: now i get it. #foo needs to exist (be static) on the page, but the selector bound to can be live
[11:07:07] <sunscreen> sweet
[11:07:11] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: thank you
[11:07:12] <sunscreen> tnx devOlsen
[11:07:16] <devOlsen> np man.
[11:07:17] <pjeweb> About http://jsfiddle.net/yHF4H/latest/: When I start dragging on the button the <li> should also start dragging but when i start dragging anywhere else in the <li> it should do nothing.
[11:07:19] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: our first game was the result of what happens when i spend a whole day at my parents :)
[11:07:19] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: after getting my ass handed to me by you and ajpiano I think I'm catching on
[11:07:21] <Eviltwin> jbrokc: Awesome :)
[11:07:26] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: no you're awesoem
[11:07:28] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: ah, fair enough
[11:07:28] <jbrokc> awesome*
[11:07:30] <supsup> pjeweb why not just use a span with a background image that looks like a  button? i think the buttons click event is winning anything sort is tryign to do
[11:07:35] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: I was addressing jbrokc's question, not yours
[11:07:40] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thats about the same frequency i actually check facebook
[11:07:44] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live if you have access to .on or .delegate
[11:07:49] <Eviltwin> It's a very misleading syntax
[11:08:06] <gnarf> this is Bullshit
[11:08:07] <gnarf> btw
[11:08:13] <gnarf> "KO" should totally be a word
[11:08:23] <sunscreen> i was thanking you for <devOlsen> change focus to live('focus',function(){}.... sunscreen.
[11:08:37] <jbrokc> Eviltwin: I don't have access to .on at the moment
[11:08:42] <pjeweb> supsup the problem is i want to bind events on other elments in the <li>… and that does not work
[11:08:49] <Eviltwin> jbrokc: So use .delegate
[11:08:51] <gnarf> its a rule in "go" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_rule
[11:08:54] <supsup> like what?
[11:09:01] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: Yes, I'm telling you not to use .live
[11:09:12] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: I'm telling you to use .on (in 1.7+) or .delegate
[11:09:36] <sunscreen> ok then
[11:10:20] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[11:10:43] <Eviltwin> We all know now it was a bad idea
[11:10:50] <Eviltwin> Confused too many people
[11:11:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah, I don't post much on FB
[11:11:34] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: just keep up w/ family, seldom seen friends
[11:12:35] <gnarf> grrr ajpiano :) http://cl.ly/3M1N3p3s1W0u2W2A1n1z
[11:12:44] <gnarf> doubled up the double letter x
[11:12:55] <Eviltwin> I looked at that and saw "nginx"
[11:12:59] <sunscreen> do you have to do event.preventDefault() ?
[11:13:15] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: For what?
[11:13:32] <sunscreen> onfocus
[11:13:33] <Eviltwin> Do you know what preventDefault means/does?
[11:13:36] <ajpiano> lol gnarf that's a bread-n-butter play !
[11:13:37] <pjeweb> supsup actually i want other elements that are [contenteditable]…  (http://jsfiddle.net/yHF4H/3/)
[11:13:59] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah - solid move ;)
[11:14:04] <Eviltwin> pjeweb: li[contenteditable]
[11:14:10] <sunscreen> the example i am looking at for .on .off has it in the events he catches
[11:14:32] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: preventDefault tells the browser not to do what it would do normally for that action
[11:14:48] <gnarf> ajpiano: i'm having one of those hating my letters games this time
[11:14:49] <devOlsen> its not needed for your instance sunscreen.
[11:14:49] <Eviltwin> So a preventDefault for a click on a link prevents the browser from following that link
[11:15:03] <ajpiano> gnarf: i'm pretty sure that's 50% of games
[11:15:07] <Eviltwin> A preventDefault for a submit prevents the form from submitting
[11:15:23] <devOlsen> or clicking a link, prevents the browser from following that link and page jumps.
[11:15:26] <pjeweb> Eviltwin yes contenteditable works fine but sorting not :) http://jsfiddle.net/yHF4H/3/
[11:15:43] <foRei> Is it possible to style the scrolling bar icons (up and down arrow) in a dropdownlist? For example specify my own pictures to use for arrows?
[11:16:26] <snagnever> hey! i have a map and i want to access its index by an id, like var map = {y=3}; var id='y'; map."id", how do  ido that?
[11:16:45] <ajpiano> snagnever: obj[ id ]
[11:16:56] <Eviltwin> foRei: Certainly not in all browsers
[11:17:05] <snagnever> ajpiano: sure! how did i forget that? S: thanks!
[11:17:33] <ryanneufeld> js objects are fun
[11:17:43] <foRei> Eviltwin can I do something tricky like overflow on a unsorted list or something?
[11:18:35] <Uriziel> http://paste2.org/p/1801314
[11:18:41] <Uriziel> pasted in firebug - it works perfectly
[11:18:48] <Uriziel> but when its in <script> tag it doesn't
[11:19:19] <Eviltwin> foRei: Maybe look at jQuery UI? I don't know.
[11:19:44] <foRei> I'll have a look, thx :)
[11:19:46] <Eviltwin> Uriziel: Does the object with class "preview" exist when this code is run?
[11:19:55] <Eviltwin> Uriziel: Has jQuery been loaded when this code is run
[11:20:09] <Uriziel>       <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

[11:20:17] <Uriziel> what else can I do?
[11:20:56] <Eviltwin> Uriziel: console.log($(".preview")) before you bind
[11:20:59] <Eviltwin> Oh
[11:21:00] <Eviltwin> Wait
[11:21:09] <Eviltwin> You're missing a function wrapper

[11:22:20] <Uriziel> y, it works now, sry, my bad
[11:23:28] <pjeweb> supsup thx but i think i was unclear but im currently looking at option {cancel: SELECTOR} maybe thats what i want :D

[11:24:48] <pjeweb> supsup thats it: http://jsfiddle.net/yHF4H/6/
[11:29:09] <DCD> anyone know why this $("input[name^=item_tax]").val(output); would affect all (including dynamic) fields beginning with item_tax instead of just the one I'm working with?
[11:29:54] <supsup> pjeweb: cool
[11:30:02] <NoiseEee> DCD: because thats what you're deliberately asking for?
[11:30:21] <Eviltwin> DCD: It's every input whose name begins with item_tax, no?
[11:30:42] <chrisvwebdev> hello all.
[11:30:50] <DCD> Yes, but I'm trying to update only the current one, not all at once.
[11:30:59] <Eviltwin> DCD: What do you mean the "current" one?
[11:31:08] <Eviltwin> Your selector asks for all of them
[11:31:55] <DCD> It's tricky because I'm dynamically adding these fields. I am running a calculation on two and dumping the result in this one. But I'm doing this for multiple items.
[11:32:08] <pjeweb> should not the :input selector include all [contenteditable] elements?
[11:32:25] <Eviltwin> DCD: This might be helpful: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[11:32:53] <DCD> @Eviltwin checking now.
[11:32:54] <Eviltwin> If you're talking about the fields that are selected in the browser
[11:33:03] <chrisvwebdev> is there a way to select all inputs in a form using a valid jquery selector?  i tried to do       $(function() {
[11:33:03] <chrisvwebdev> 		$('form').submit(function(e){
[11:33:03] <chrisvwebdev> 				e.preventDefault(); $('this :input').each(function(){ do stuff....}); }); but it doesn't work
[11:33:06] <chrisvwebdev> any suggestions?
[11:33:09] <Robbington> Hey, bit of advice cloning elements with events. Have an UL with li with click events, need to clone them to for a slider, but the original click event isnt getting cloned?
[11:33:41] <Eviltwin> chrisvwebdev: Can you paste that to pastebin or something?
[11:33:51] <Eviltwin> Try not to paste more than one simple line here directly
[11:34:03] <jscheel> hi all. I've upgraded to 1.7, but I am still seeing the event.layerX and event.layerY warnings in chrome. Any idea why this would be?

[11:34:49] <Eviltwin> jesster7: Access them via event.originalEvent.layerX instead?
[11:34:57] <jscheel> well, I guess it's probably happening in all webkit browsers, but still

[11:35:48] <Eviltwin> Robbington: With the right arguments it will copy all of the event listeners etc
[11:35:51] <chrisvwebdev> @eviltwin..sure
[11:35:51] <chrisvwebdev> thx
[11:35:59] <jscheel> Eviltwin: no code is calling layerX or layerY
[11:36:20] <Eviltwin> jscheel: Hmm... I dunno then
[11:36:20] <DCD> In the image, I'm basically setting the tax amount based on the selected item for that line. Then when I add the quantity I run a function to calculate the total.
[11:36:24] <Eviltwin> Do you know where it's coming from?
[11:36:38] <DCD> I only run into a problem with subsequent items.
[11:36:46] <jscheel> nope, doesn't give me any line numbers
[11:36:56] <Eviltwin> DCD: I'm trying to help you but I need to know specifically what use action causes specficically what outcome
[11:37:07] <Eviltwin> And to code it, I need to see how your HTML/JS is laid out
[11:37:32] <DCD> Can't use jsFiddle because I've got php running.
[11:37:42] <NoiseEee> o.O
[11:37:50] <Eviltwin> DCD: Just copy the source of the page
[11:37:53] <ahandy> how would i go about adding a "Click to vote" text or whatever over a div whenever the user hovers over it?
[11:37:58] <jscheel> hmm, the event.layerX and event.layerY events only happen when I click
[11:37:59] <DCD> will do.
[11:38:14] <Eviltwin> ahandy: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_standard_title.asp ?
[11:38:42] <Eviltwin> ahandy: Is that what you're talking about?
[11:38:59] <jscheel> Eviltwin: ahh, it looks like a chrome extension is the culprit
[11:39:01] <jscheel> lame
[11:39:40] <ahandy> Eviltwin: what? :p what i'm trying to do is have an image, and whenever someone hovers over it, it would change the opacity to something more dark, and show a "Click to vote" text over it
[11:40:38] <jscheel> aha, looks like AdBlock is still loading an old version of jquerty

[11:41:35] <Eviltwin> ahandy: see ? .hover
[11:41:35] <bot-t> ahandy, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[11:41:50] <ahandy> Eviltwin: yea, but with what? how would i about adding that text over the image
[11:41:55] <Robbington> Elivtwin, the problems isnt cloning the events, which works with .clone(true), but if it only works once and if the element is cloned again it loses the event
[11:41:55] <DCD> I'm sure the issue is in the setTaxID() function
[11:42:03] <devOlsen> foRei, http://ryanfait.com/resources/custom-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons/ for a complete crossbrowser solution

[11:43:42] <DCD> Eviltwin I'll doublecheck but I think the function fails on using $(this)

[11:45:24] <devOlsen> haha, cats on keyboards are awesome.
[11:45:28] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, oh shoot, apparently i load jquery twice, so it must clear it out...

[11:47:08] <chrisvwebdev> much appreciated
[11:47:41] <DCD> Eviltwin adding $(this) on the recalc function causes the output to be put in the quantity field, not the item_total field.

[11:48:39] <ProLoser> hey guys
[11:49:03] <ProLoser> i have a question
[11:49:17] <ProLoser> Is anyone aware of the problem with ipad not firing click events when live binded or delegated?
[11:49:37] <ProLoser> i mean specifically on non anchor tags? such as list items?
[11:49:42] <ProLoser> I'm wondering if there is a bug filed for this on jquery and if it's something they even feel needs addressing
[11:49:51] <Eviltwin> DCD: There's a lot of code here but I suspect you want to do something like $(this).closest("[id^=input]").find("input[name^=item_qty]") or whatever
[11:50:08] <zulax> how do you reach a <section> with jquery
[11:50:12] <DCD> Eviltwin I bound the recalc function to the keyup of the quantity field. I used on() so that it would work with dynamic fields. When the tax selector is chosen, the tax amount gets updated. But if I add a field, all the tax amounts get adjusted instead of the closest one.
[11:50:12] <zulax> like # or .
[11:50:12] <Eviltwin> DCD: That meanas it starts at the quantity field, goes up to the parent #input

[11:54:51] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/aNWWM/73/ (simple dropdown menu) - are there ways to make this JS more DRY / simple / beautiful?
[11:54:52] <minna1> What can cause .hide() to print display:list-item instead of display:none?!!
[11:55:03] <muzone> Will show pic of my naked wife if someone can take a quick look!
[11:55:43] <Zogot> I'm still new to JS, but can't you put the css in a { } var and just recall it once?
[11:56:02] <muzone> Zogot: so i was hoping..
[11:56:28] <Zogot> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[11:56:30] <Zogot> 3rd example
[11:56:35] <bfr> How can i detect if display: none changes to display: block and react on that?
[11:56:53] <Zogot> var current = $(this).attr('display');
[11:56:54] <Zogot> ?
[11:57:05] <Zogot> oh wait
[11:57:25] <Zogot> normally what I do is have a class for display: none
[11:57:31] <Zogot> and check if that class is there
[11:58:07] <Robbington> bfr if($element.css(display) == block )
[11:58:21] <ngharo> .css('display') or .is(':visible')
[11:58:28] <DCD> Eviltwin how do I make it go to the next input (in other words after the quantity instead of in it)?
[11:58:35] <bfr> really that simple?
[11:59:11] <coderzach> bfr: do you want to check if it changed, or fire an event when it changes?
[11:59:15] <Robbington> bfr, did you want to check on a click event?
[11:59:19] <bfr> fire an event
[11:59:25] <bfr> no
[11:59:35] <Zogot> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/aNWWM/77/ something like that
[12:00:03] <bfr> not click. It get's changed with jquery when some other div gets active class
[12:00:17] <muzone> lol
[12:00:25] <muzone> Zogot that is amazing man!!
[12:01:39] <muzone> Zogot: thanks a lot man..
[12:01:49] <coderzach> bfr: DOMAttrModified in mozilla and opera, onpropertychange in ie
[12:01:58] <coderzach> bfr: not sure about chrome tho
[12:01:58] <muzone> http://media.starblogs.se/1bc96b323de54736be0cdd31643e2aec.jpg
[12:02:11] <muzone> Zogot: for u bro
[12:02:22] <bfr> coderzach: what about .on(), could that be used?
[12:02:38] <DCD> Eviltwin plus the item_tax input is readonly, I'm wondering if that is a problem. Both .closest and .next puts the data into the item_qty field and not item_tax
[12:03:19] <coderzach> bfr: nope
[12:04:28] <bfr> coderzach: another way would be to react when certain div get class "active-form", would it be easier to react to that?
[12:04:52] <ryanneufeld> ?newcontent
[12:04:53] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[12:05:18] <danzik17> muzone: one thing you should absolutely do is chain those calls, or at least cache a reference to $(this).....it's a waste to do that multiple times.
[12:05:38] <coderzach> bfr: probably not
[12:05:55] <bfr> ryanneufeld: thanks but i can only use jquery ui, no other plugins
[12:06:09] <ryanneufeld> bfr: ....
[12:06:10] <Robbington> Can anyone tell me why clone() only clones the event once. I.e if the element is cloned for a second time it loses the event?
[12:09:40] <domcat> any recommendation for a jQuery timer that can start, stop and also pause the timer? I find this older plugin, which works good, but I miss the pause feature there http://jquery.offput.ca/every/
[12:10:22] <ProLoser|iPad> can anyone help me with some ipad bugs?
[12:11:00] <ProLoser|iPad> for some reason, live binding or delegate binding of click events to LIs does not work. this occurs on 1.7 and 1.6 and seems to be moderately well known
[12:11:04] <ProLoser|iPad> are there any known fixes for this?
[12:11:12] <Eviltwin> Sorry guys, I got pulled away for a few
[12:12:22] <DCD> Eviltwin you rock - I got it with $(this).closest("[id^=input]").find('#input_tax input').val(setTax(opt)); thanks so much!
[12:13:22] <Eviltwin> Cool, you're welcome
[12:13:41] <Robbington> Can anyone tell me why clone() only clones the event once. I.e if the element is cloned for a second time it loses the event?
[12:13:46] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|iPad: Did you find other posts about it?
[12:14:31] <Uriziel> how can I stop browser's right menu click prevent from appearing on right click on element with mousedown handler
[12:15:05] <ProLoser|iPad> eviltwin: i found bits and peices online of people discussing it, but no actual discussion about the bug being submitted to the core
[12:15:24] <ProLoser|iPad> i mean, i can avoid using delegate or live but that seems unreasonable
[12:15:33] <ProLoser|iPad> (on non anchor elements_
[12:15:37] <Eviltwin> Robbington: http://jsfiddle.net/Rsnhe/
[12:16:30] <danzik17> ProLoser|iPad: can you make a fiddle of that bug?  curious since i haven't ran into any issues with it as of yet
[12:16:32] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|iPad: Well with most of the coding I've done for iOS, I've used the touch events
[12:17:23] <Eviltwin> Robbington: Cloning a clone is working fine there so I'm not sure what you're doing wrong
[12:17:24] <ProLoser|iPad_> sorry about that, webchat timed out
[12:17:57] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|iPad: I suggest Colloquy
[12:18:50] <ProLoser|iPad_> noted
[12:18:59] <ProLoser|iPad_> anyway, any ideas about my dilemma?
[12:19:18] <Eviltwin> So events are't bubbling or what?
[12:19:19] <danzik17> ProLoser|iPad_: do you have a fiddle with the bug?  curious
[12:19:49] <ProLoser|iPad_> give me a sec
[12:20:31] <joshsmith> why can't I call .length on this: { hue: '0x00ff00' }
[12:21:01] <NoiseEee> length is for arrays.
[12:22:06] <joshsmith> hmm I'm able to call .length on another object somehow
[12:22:13] <joshsmith> actually, nvm
[12:22:26] <ProLoser|iPad_> http://jsbin.com/ecoqob/ @ danzik17 & eviltwin
[12:22:59] <joshsmith> NoiseEee: is there anyway I can do something similar to .length here? and iterate through that object?
[12:23:17] <Robbington> EvilTwin, doesnt seem to be matter how many times the event is clones, but if the click event is fired then its cloned again it doesnt clone the event
[12:23:20] <ProLoser|iPad_> live binded code fails, i even tried on() using 1.7 to no avail
[12:23:55] <ProLoser|iPad_> the same thing occurs for delegated code
[12:23:57] <hightekvagabond> ok, so, in this plugin have a string called callback which contains the name of the callback function that I want to call but I'm having a hard time coming up with a nice clean way to go from a string containing the function name to actually being the function itself so that I can use .call or .apply… what is the trick I'm missing?
[12:24:37] <danzik17> ProLoser|iPad_: maybe i'm blind but...what's failing?  all 3 LIs are triggering the event as expected
[12:24:42] <danzik17> least for me
[12:25:10] <ProLoser|iPad_> you're obviously not on an ipad and so missed half the convo
[12:25:20] <danzik17> ah yes, that's probably the case :(
[12:25:22] <ProLoser|iPad_> i just realized that delgation appears to be firing properly :/
[12:26:28] <finnland> good morning, good day and good evening depending on where you all are
[12:27:07] <NoiseEee> joshsmith: if your browser supports it, Object.keys(objName).length will give it to you
[12:27:09] <hightekvagabond> nevermind, found the jquery.callback function in 1.7
[12:27:12] <ProLoser|iPad_> I think using dleegate fixes this
[12:27:14] <NoiseEee> joshsmith: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[12:27:22] <ProLoser|iPad_> alright i gotta go home to pick up my laptop now
[12:27:27] <ProLoser|iPad_> later peeps
[12:27:57] <Eviltwin> Sorry, my internet was really sucking there
[12:28:02] <finnland> this is pretty much a newbe questin that i have but when is $.ajax suposed to throw the error callback?
[12:28:05] <Eviltwin> pjeweb: Can you try this? http://jsfiddle.net/vLdyc/
[12:28:08] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:28:19] <Eviltwin> That was for ProLoser
[12:28:39] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: You know about for(var k in obhect) right?
[12:29:09] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: ahh, that's probably what I want
[12:29:47] <Morteza> hiiiiiiiiiiiii
[12:30:07] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Probably
[12:30:47] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: why bother when Object.keys offers a solution?
[12:30:59] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[12:31:11] <NoiseEee> plus for(var k in object) you also need to hasOwnProperty
[12:31:35] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/dwEAn/
[12:31:57] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: Object.keys offers a solution for some browsers
[12:32:01] <Eviltwin> Doesn't exist in all
[12:32:12] <Eviltwin> And for many browsers, only exists in a recent version
[12:32:25] <Eviltwin> for(var k in object) is from JavaScript core
[12:32:34] <Eviltwin> No browser doesn't support that if it supports JavaScript
[12:33:29] <Eviltwin> Object.keys effectively uses for(var k in object) to build an array of keys and then returns that array
[12:33:46] <Eviltwin> If joshsmith's goal is to iterate over the keys, Object.keys will be slower
[12:34:22] <Eviltwin> Because it will first iterate over the keys to build the array then he will iterate over the array
[12:34:33] <finnland> the reason why i'm asking is tahat $.ajax always executes success even if the server responds 404, 400, 500 etc.. any clue why it does that?
[12:34:43] <Eviltwin> What?
[12:34:49] <Eviltwin> Are you sure about that?
[12:34:54] <finnland> yes
[12:35:07] <Eviltwin> Do you have an example of this you can show?
[12:35:34] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: gracias, this is exactly what I wanted. it's been awhile working in native JS for me....
[12:36:15] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: I figured that's what you were looking for
[12:36:29] <Eviltwin> Keep in mind that the keys aren't necessarily in any particular order
[12:36:49] <finnland> http://pastebin.com/Dkp84GpB
[12:36:54] <finnland> quick testcode
[12:37:09] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: that's perfectly fine. I'm using this for Google's static maps API
[12:37:30] <joshsmith> so things don't need to be in order
[12:38:43] <bl4ckcomb> is there a common way to split off internally used 'classes'/'data structures' to other .js files and then use them in a custom jQuery plugin, hence making the project easier to manage and keeping files short/simple?
[12:39:28] <snover> finnland: you are wrong. success handler always called for status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304.
[12:39:34] <snover> otherwise error handler is called.
[12:39:51] <finnland> snover: hmm, this always prints "Null data"
[12:40:49] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: For development purposes sure but when you're releasing a plugin, it's best to offer it all in one file
[12:40:51] <finnland> snover: and textStatus is 'Success'
[12:41:01] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: Or perhaps one JavaScript file and one CSS file
[12:41:22] <Eviltwin> finnland: Perhaps it's successful?
[12:41:29] <atxq> so is it possible to update a text input after .hide() is envoked?
[12:41:34] <snover> finnland: just because your server is not returning data does not mean it is sending an error status coded
[12:41:37] <Eviltwin> atxq: Sure
[12:41:39] <snover> code*
[12:41:57] <Eviltwin> finnland: Use Firebug to see what the response code it
[12:41:58] <Eviltwin> is*
[12:41:59] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, yes of course, but is there any convention that shows me how it should be done? I want the classes to exist in the plugin's scope and not in global scope
[12:42:13] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: That's what the (function($){...})(jQuery); is for
[12:42:21] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: Anything in the ... is in private scope
[12:42:36] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:42:39] <finnland> FF reports GET [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found]
[12:42:47] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, so I just do $.fn.myPlugin.classX = function ... ?
[12:43:04] <atxq> Eviltwin, thanks for the response.
[12:43:04] <bl4ckcomb> inside that structure you just gave
[12:44:37] <multipass> anyone know if you can get rid of the recomendations at the end of youtube videos?
[12:45:22] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: http://jsfiddle.net/tntNt/
[12:46:23] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: Read that page Plugin Authoring page too
[12:47:13] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, I've read that page, and I (hopefully) understand your code snippet, but if I define something in the closure, should I beware that I'm not giving names that already exist?
[12:48:33] <bl4ckcomb> for instance, is there any certainty that what I define within the closure doesn't clash with functions/structures from other plugins?
[12:48:46] <tonyjcamp> multipass: there's a setting for that in your account
[12:49:15] <tonyjcamp> multipass: I'm assuming you don't want recommendations to show on YOUR videos right?
[12:49:41] <multipass> well i have the video embeded on my site, but client dosnt want reccomendations to show at the end of the video, tonyjcamp
[12:50:02] <tonyjcamp> multipass: have them log into their account and disable that feature.
[12:50:27] <jaequery> i have a container that is 1200px x 1200px,   inside it i have elements ranging in fixed width/heights of all sizes....    now i want to resize the container to 600px x 600px ,   is there any way to make all the contents inside the container also resize proportionately ?
[12:50:35] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, also for instance this: http://jsfiddle.net/tntNt/1/. If I load both files, will my plugin be able to use ClassX or is it out of scope?
[12:53:07] * dogarrhea2_ pounds his fist.  I demand service!
[12:53:09] <hightekvagabond> I thought maybe the .Callback() was going to save me on this but I'm still having trouble casting from a string to a function…. I know there must be an intermediate step I'm missing….  I know that in this example I could pass the function but to match against the code that I'm working with I need to be able to pass the name of my callback as a string…. anyone have a clue what my magic missing step is? http://j
[12:53:10] <dogarrhea2_> just kidding.
[12:53:24] <dogarrhea2_> wish bugs would get a response a little quicker on the bug tracker
[12:53:38] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, sorry, I got disconnected
[12:54:06] <dogarrhea2_> so there's this complex scheme for css precedence rules that i'm unaware of using some vector of values
[12:56:28] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: ajpiano had a great doc he linked for this
[12:56:31] <Eviltwin> Let me see if I can find it
[12:56:33] <meLon> Would someone hilight my nick?  :P
[12:56:43] <Eviltwin> Duke_Puke: Waht's up?
[12:56:46] <Eviltwin> meLon: Why?
[12:57:06] <meLon> Thank you Eviltwin.  Made a hilight adjustment and none of my friends are online atm
[12:57:34] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[12:57:55] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, thank you very much
[12:58:31] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: You'll probably be interested in the cross-file private state
[12:58:40] <Eviltwin> If you insist on having separate files that all need access to that
[12:58:42] <bl4ckcomb> yes exactly :)
[12:59:17] <bl4ckcomb> and as you said before, the production package will consist of a merged js file and a css file
[12:59:51] <min|dvir|us> Hi guys. http://jsfiddle.net/R4egc/3/ -- works fine in Firefox but in Chrome the checkbox seems to never appear.
[12:59:53] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: At which point technically you wouldn't need any of this
[12:59:57] <Eviltwin> It could all be one closure
[13:00:00] <min|dvir|us> Super-minimal example, easy to understand.
[13:00:02] <Eviltwin> Which is why a lot of these things are written all as one closure
[13:00:34] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: What's your goal with that?
[13:00:47] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: I want Chrome to display it like Firefox does.
[13:00:52] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: image is not added to the DOM
[13:00:52] <min|dvir|us> I want it to do what the code says.
[13:00:59] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: it is.
[13:01:00] <bl4ckcomb> Eviltwin, yeah, I'll just merge it all in one closure for the production package, but for dev. purposes it would be nice to have separate files
[13:01:03] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: it is just instantly removed.
[13:01:05] <Eviltwin> Oh, wait, after
[13:01:08] <min|dvir|us> The callback fires instantly.
[13:01:17] <min|dvir|us> Only in Chrome.
[13:02:34] <min|dvir|us> Works in every browser but Chrome, including Firefox, IE9, Safari, and Opera.
[13:02:40] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: K, let me browse
[13:02:55] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: thanks so much!
[13:04:02] <min|dvir|us> What's interesting to note is that http://jsfiddle.net/R4egc/4/ works in Chrome.
[13:04:20] <min|dvir|us> I wrapped the fadeOut with setTimeout(f, 0).
[13:05:03] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: Yeah, there are a number of things like that
[13:05:34] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: know of any relevant bug reports?
[13:05:41] <min|dvir|us> A best-case workaround?
[13:06:00] <Eviltwin> There's also issues with focusing elements on DOM ready etc
[13:06:37] <johnwarren> Wondering if anyone here has any experience with jQuery Countdown -- specifically in getting it to display a "this has expired" message?
[13:07:04] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us: fwiw, i get the intended effect of http://jsfiddle.net/R4egc/3/ on Chrome linux
[13:07:19] <joshsmith> if I have a string that may or may not have a preceding pipe char, how can I strip that char easily?
[13:07:57] <min|dvir|us> NoiseEee: from your perspective, I am lying. :)
[13:08:43] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Look at string.replace

[13:14:36] <Eviltwin> selbekk: Any reason you aren't using JSON.parse ?
[13:14:54] <selbekk> hm, I guess because I didn't know that was a way to do it?
[13:15:03] <Eviltwin> selbekk: And can you link us a pastebin of the JSON that it's choking on?

[13:21:19] <Bearcat> folks, on autoalert.feline-soul.net i've got a problem with IE 8. I have a transparent png that is fading in and out by animating the opacity. The background is black in ie 8 and looks fine in ie 9 and firefox/chrome. I've been searching for an answer to make the background transparent, but striking out. If i turn off the fading effect then the background is transparent as it should be. Can IE 8 do this
[13:21:20] <Bearcat> animation at all? Can someone give me a hand? My knowledge of JQ is very low.
[13:22:44] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Sorry
[13:22:54] <Eviltwin> | means "or" in regex
[13:22:57] <Eviltwin> So you need to escape it

[13:27:22] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: thanks. I ran across that last night and i tried it, but had no luck. I may have just misapplied it, so i'll try it again.
[13:27:39] <hightekvagabond> Eviltwin: last night you said callbacks were not done with evals but I've tried using apply and call against a string, even tried passing the string to $.Callback to no avail…. could you glance at this and tell me what I could do to avoid the eval? http://jsfiddle.net/hightekvagabond/kaAR4/5/
[13:28:16] <monkeyslee> Eviltwin: thanks
[13:28:39] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: i'm also using absolute positioning on this image, incase that effects the problem.
[13:28:52] <Eviltwin> monkeyslee: window[callback] if you must pass the callback as a string
[13:28:54] <Eviltwin> Err
[13:28:56] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond:
[13:28:58] <Eviltwin> See what I just wrote
[13:29:17] <hightekvagabond> funny… thanks
[13:30:42] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: Why does it need to work this way, anyway?
[13:31:06] <Eviltwin> window[callback](message) will work as long as the function is global
[13:31:11] <Eviltwin> But if it's not, it won't work
[13:31:28] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: should i check to see if this png has gamma applied or is that a non-issue?
[13:31:41] <Eviltwin> Bearcat: I don't really know much about the problem, just that it's a problem
[13:31:42] <razzi> does anybody have experience with binding an onclick handler to element inside an inline fancybox?
[13:31:44] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: i appreciate the help, i'm very new at this particular set of issues
[13:31:44] <Eviltwin> I would read that post
[13:32:04] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: read, both last night and just now  :"
[13:32:09] <Bearcat> :)
[13:32:35] <Eviltwin> Bearcat: Well all I know is that there is some issue with PNG transparency in most versions of IE
[13:32:42] <Eviltwin> So you officially know more about the issue than I do
[13:32:50] <razzi> $('#facnybox-content #Close').live( 'click', function(event) {}); doesn't seem to bind
[13:33:11] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: so...i'm dooomed!! :")
[13:33:16] <Eviltwin> razzi: Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[13:33:37] <Eviltwin> Bearcat: Did you try that thing that has 30 votes?
[13:33:38] <razzi> o wait, i think i know the problem, i gotta bind it after fancybox is shown
[13:34:01] <Eviltwin> Or the next thing that has 2
[13:34:18] <hightekvagabond> Eviltwin: to answer your "why does it need to work this way" question…. I'm replacing an old soap client library that only worked in firefox with something written in jquery… the old one worked by passing in strings…. to allow backwards compatability with the code already in place I need to mimic the old way of calling it
[13:34:19] <fission6> http://dpaste.com/662903/ is there a more ideal way to write this
[13:34:50] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: Unfortunate but understandable
[13:35:09] <Jak2000> hi all
[13:35:15] <Eviltwin> fission6: What version of jQuery are you using?
[13:35:33] <Jak2000> anyone can share a tutorial for work directly Jquery with php and Mysql? (not like me ajax)
[13:35:38] <hightekvagabond> Eviltwin: this is just a wrapper function…. I have more than one way to call it, I will sysematically clean out the old stuff in time
[13:36:32] <Eviltwin> fission6: Did you try this? http://dpaste.com/662907/
[13:36:34] <TheoMurpse> Does jquery not let you add a SPAN to a SPAN?
[13:36:36] <fission6> jquery-1.6.4.min.js"
[13:36:41] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: What do you mean by that?
[13:36:43] <TheoMurpse> ie nest SPANs?
[13:36:48] <Eviltwin> TheoMurpse: It does...
[13:36:56] <TheoMurpse> http://jsfiddle.net/C8jHy/
[13:37:02] <Eviltwin> Err
[13:37:06] <TheoMurpse> Am I missing something silly?
[13:37:10] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: What do you mean by that?
[13:37:31] <Eviltwin> TheoMurpse: http://jsfiddle.net/C8jHy/2/
[13:37:38] <Eviltwin> ?.add @ TheoMurpse
[13:37:39] <bot-t> TheoMurpse, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[13:37:41] <Eviltwin> ?.append @ TheoMurpse
[13:37:41] <fission6> thanks Eviltwin looks good.
[13:37:41] <bot-t> TheoMurpse, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[13:37:44] <Eviltwin> Read the docs in the future
[13:37:45] <TheoMurpse> Yeah I feel dumb.
[13:37:53] <slartsa> is there a jquery slideshow plugin I could run locally and have it automatically fetch the images from a specific folder?
[13:37:56] <Eviltwin> jQuery has *fantastic* documentation
[13:38:04] <TheoMurpse> Eviltwin, I"ve read the docs and other docs too many times to keep the stuff straight. My bad, no need to be a dick.
[13:38:04] <Jak2000> Evil i want insert records on a mysql table, how do this?
[13:38:05] <Eviltwin> Use it
[13:38:55] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: PHP + MySQL need to completely finish running before the page has finished being sent to the client
[13:39:05] <Eviltwin> Once the page has arrived at the client
[13:39:11] <Eviltwin> Then JavaScript + jQuery kicks in
[13:39:19] <Eviltwin> You can't really "use" jQuery in PHP
[13:39:31] <Eviltwin> You can write jQuery in PHP but it won't run until it's at the client
[13:40:08] <Jak2000> Eviltwin i found this youtube video: PHP Tutorials: jQuery: Get data from MySQL Database without refreshing
[13:40:23] <Eviltwin> That uses AJAX, no?
[13:40:53] <josefrichter> guys, is there a way to inject a tiny bit of javascript into existing website ideally thru its URL? no evil...
[13:41:02] <fission6> Eviltwin: is there a more compact or generic way to write that code or does what you wrote work just fine in terms of sensible code
[13:41:16] <Jak2000> Eviltwin how toknow if use ajax?
[13:41:18] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: Not reliably (to avoid evil)
[13:41:20] <Jak2000> other tutorial: http://www.reynoldsftw.com/2009/03/live-mysql-database-search-with-jquery/
[13:41:32] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: You can stick a javascript:... URL in the bar after it loads and run that
[13:41:50] <Eviltwin> Or use javascript:... in a bookmark to cause that script to run when you click the bookmark
[13:41:55] <Eviltwin> (Run in the current page)
[13:41:59] <Eviltwin> It's called a bookmarklet
[13:42:03] <khorn> confused by something and hoping someone can help
[13:42:09] <josefrichter> Eviltwin: and as a URL parameter or something? So that I can send a single link?
[13:42:09] <Eviltwin> I'll BRB
[13:42:17] <khorn> I have a $.post() call that isn't calling the callback function
[13:43:17] <khorn> I can see the AJAX call using Firebug and it comes back with a 200 OK, and the correct data (I think)...is there anything else that would cause the callback not to fire?
[13:43:30] <NoiseEee> khorn: crystal ball.... fuzzy
[13:43:55] <NoiseEee> (aka pastebin code khorn)
[13:45:39] <josefrichter> how to get the index of an element within a parent please? for example to get information like #foo is the third <div> within #parent.
[13:46:27] <Bearcat> Eviltwin: i did try both, but i'm new enough that for that second one i'm thinking "Ok, i just need to put all this inside a <script> tag and it will work..right?"
[13:46:38] <khorn> NoiseEee: http://dpaste.com/662916/
[13:47:27] <khorn> that code worked before last week...and hasn't been changed since October
[13:47:31] <Kuni> josefrichter: .prevAll() could help you, I think
[13:47:45] <sphinxxx> khorn, post your php code
[13:49:50] <Jak2000> Eviltwin, can i ask here ajax code?
[13:55:32] <nobitanobi> I have one two drop downs, and I want that on the change of a value of the first one, I load new stuff on the second one.  Anywhere/examples where I can take a look please ?
[13:58:40] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: You can't do it as a URL parameter. This would allow evilness.
[13:59:01] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: As for index, it's not surprisingly .index()
[13:59:23] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: Just ask your questions, don't ask to ask
[13:59:34] <Jak2000> ajax question: http://pastebin.com/a9jwiM9T   <-- in line 40, i call the page: muestrapost.php   (yo see the code of muestrapost.php after line: 129, my question is: what is bad/wrong why not display anything  thanks.
[13:59:42] <hightekvagabond> But you ARE the Eviltwin don't you encourage evilness? ;)
[14:00:03] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: I also like to be the only one capable of pure evil so I keep my secrets to myself
[14:00:07] <josefrichter> Eviltwin: ok. so probably redirecting to my domain and using iframe?
[14:00:19] <hightekvagabond> good answer
[14:00:24] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: You'll see why that doesn't work :P
[14:00:26] <Eviltwin> Again, evil
[14:00:58] <khorn> sphinxxx...I'm not sure that's feasible...I'm dealing with a ridiculous home-grown "framework" so it would have to be several hundred lines of code at least for any kind of working example
[14:01:02] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: Are you using jQuery in this page or not?
[14:01:19] <Jak2000> i use ajax
[14:01:28] <Jak2000> you see the code?
[14:01:30] <khorn> sphinxxx: I can tell you that it returns a 200 OK response code, and the content-type is text/plain
[14:01:39] <josefrichter> Eviltwin: ok. my use case: have existing website and want to show it's owner how to improve it with a tiny bit of javascript. but obviously don't have server access. any ideas?
[14:02:17] <hightekvagabond> josefrichter: is it a static web site or a dynamic one?
[14:02:23] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: It's a security risk to allow person A to craft a page or link that will make person B run additional JavaScript on a page hoster by person C
[14:02:32] <Eviltwin> hosted*
[14:02:42] <josefrichter> hightekvagabond a dynamic one. why?
[14:02:48] <Eviltwin> Probably the easist thing to do is copy the HTML
[14:02:53] <Eviltwin> Add a <base> tag that refers to the original page
[14:02:58] <Eviltwin> And make the necessary alterations
[14:03:05] <hightekvagabond> josefrichter: because if it were static it would be simple to just copy it somewhere else and show them there
[14:03:20] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: What's not working?
[14:03:56] <xckpd7> question: I'm looking at the api, and I'm looking at index
[14:04:04] <josefrichter> huh wtf is base tag? :-o
[14:04:15] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: Specifies what all relative URLs are relative to
[14:04:20] <xckpd7> I'm trying to find out how to grab an elements index, and then show another element based on that index
[14:04:24] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp
[14:04:59] <xckpd7> nvm... .get()
[14:05:31] <NaN> what's the selector for "this" inside a function?
[14:05:42] <sindresorhus> josefrichter: Better reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/base
[14:05:48] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: If you want it to be a jQuery collection, use .eq instead
[14:05:53] <Eviltwin> NaN: ...What do you mean?
[14:06:20] <nobitanobi> I've a question... I've a dropdown with regions... And I want another one with cities of that selected region in the first dropdown.  I want to have a .change() on that first dropdown that will load the cities of the selected region. My question is: Should I do AJAX calls everytime is an on change, or load (hide) all regions/cities?
[14:06:38] <NaN> Eviltwin: I want to reference the same selector inside a function
[14:06:39] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: thanks, you probably just saved me a ton of headache
[14:06:48] <Jak2000> Eviltwin, i have the next dude: 1) if the button(button1) call the funciton: Cotiza() and if Cotiza call the page muestrapost.php, and 3) why not display anything on the div: ajaxDiv
[14:07:08] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: if the whole list is relatively small (less than 1-2k) just load the whole thing right away
[14:07:25] <nobitanobi> ok. Eviltwin
[14:07:41] <nobitanobi> less than 1000-2000. that's fair :)
[14:07:42] <nobitanobi> thanks
[14:07:59] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: Do you have Firebug or something so you can add breakpoints?
[14:08:01] <Eviltwin> See what's going on?
[14:08:12] <Eviltwin> NaN: Can you make a pastebin or jsFiddle example of your goal?
[14:08:19] <nobitanobi> what should I read to improve my thinking on decide that kind of things?
[14:08:20] <Eviltwin> NaN: I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to do
[14:08:52] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: You could try it both ways and play with it for a while
[14:09:06] <Eviltwin> Also try it on like a slow internet cafe connection or a fast broadband connection
[14:09:11] <Jak2000> ok. Eviltwin in ajax how to display a message  same as a javascript alert function?
[14:09:12] <Eviltwin> And see how the two behave
[14:09:16] <nobitanobi> ok. Thanks Eviltwin
[14:09:17] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: It's entirely subjective
[14:09:22] <nobitanobi> is it?
[14:09:22] <nobitanobi> ok
[14:09:27] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: It's still alert
[14:09:32] <Eviltwin> nobitanobi: More or less
[14:10:49] <nobitanobi> I will play with it. Thanks a lot
[14:11:10] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: You could also try opening before you set the .onreadystatechange, not sure if it makes any difference
[14:11:45] <xckpd7> question: what's the best way to toggle a list of links.... like if I click on one link, I want the original one to go back to normal
[14:11:54] <NaN> Eviltwin: http://www.pastie.org/2935678
[14:12:03] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: What original one?
[14:12:09] <xckpd7> I could either set a variable with the one that is focused and then grab it and remove it when another one is toggled
[14:12:14] <alvincrespo> xckpd7: bind/trigger an event to the containing element
[14:12:17] <alvincrespo> ?
[14:12:22] <alvincrespo> thats how I would do it
[14:12:34] <Eviltwin> NaN: $(this)
[14:13:19] <NaN> gooood
[14:13:22] <NaN> thanks Eviltwin
[14:13:23] <Eviltwin> NaN: $("#some") uses the selector #some and builds a jQuery object
[14:13:24] <nobitanobi> Eviltwin: If I decide to do the first strategy, should I load them and save them as a (for example) JSON object?
[14:13:26] <Eviltwin> That was the confusion
[14:13:30] <Eviltwin> $(this) is not a selector
[14:13:52] <Jak2000> Eviltwin, i think  my problem is on lines 37, 38
[14:13:59] <NaN> then what is?
[14:14:00] <xckpd7> I'm just now getting into jQuery event delegation (if that's what it's called): that makes sense but how would i do that? if any link is clicked, get rid of all the classes except the one I clicked?
[14:14:14] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: It is
[14:14:16] <xckpd7> alvincrespo: ^
[14:14:33] <Eviltwin> You need to do <SELECT ID="operacion"...> if you want to getElementById('operacion')
[14:14:44] <alvincrespo> yeah, so you would essentially target an element and bind a custom event:
[14:14:46] <alvincrespo> like so:
[14:14:55] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: $("a").removeClass("foo"); $(this).addClass("foo")
[14:14:59] <Jak2000> ooo instead of name
[14:14:59] <Jak2000> ok
[14:15:17] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: You could also have name but you need to have ID if you want to get by ID
[14:15:18] <alvincrespo> $("#list").bind("someEvt")
[14:15:23] <alvincrespo> and when you click, you would then trigger it
[14:15:25] <Jak2000> something: <SELECT id="operacion" NAME="operacion">
[14:15:28] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: wouldn't there be a flash if I did that?
[14:15:29] <Eviltwin> Yup
[14:15:36] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: No, it's synchronous
[14:15:46] <Jak2000> ok working
[14:15:50] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: wt* ? how so?
[14:15:54] <alvincrespo> $("#list a").click(function(){ $("#list").trigger("someEvt");  });
[14:16:09] <xckpd7> how is it synchronous? I don't get it
[14:16:12] <alvincrespo> and in the binded event, just strip out any class your looking for and then set it to the element clicked on
[14:17:20] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Do you see a flash here? http://jsfiddle.net/H4RFu/
[14:17:37] <kanzie> is the correct way to fire a custom event in 1.7 to use $('#foo').trigger('myEventName') and then at other place do $('#foo').on('myEventName', function() {}); ?
[14:17:59] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: no I believe you, I just thought elements executed in order... so if you did that like 1000 times... I'm just trying to understand why
[14:18:02] <Jak2000> Eviltwin thanks by moment continue.... working (thanks for the advice) :)
[14:18:09] <Eviltwin> Jak2000: Great!
[14:18:13] <Eviltwin> Congratulations
[14:18:26] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: They are executed in order
[14:18:33] <Eviltwin> The class is added and then the class is removed
[14:18:43] <Eviltwin> The deal is that the browser doesn't redraw between when it's added and removed
[14:18:59] <xckpd7> interesting... I guess I won't ask why. Thanks!
[14:19:14] <Eviltwin> The reason why is because of things exactly like this
[14:19:20] <k1ng> can anyone recommend me a facebook like chat?
[14:19:32] <Eviltwin> Browser makers know you might have to do a bunch of work to get everything presentable
[14:20:26] <Eviltwin> Imagine you're trying to add a million cells to a table
[14:20:35] <Eviltwin> It'd be horribly slow if it drew as you added each one
[14:21:31] <Eviltwin> kanzie: Yes .trigger is the right way to trigger an event
[14:21:39] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: thanks
[14:21:49] <kanzie> Eviltwin: and on() for listen for the trigger? or should I use bind?
[14:22:10] <Eviltwin> kanzie: For 1.7+, .bind actually calls .on
[14:22:15] <Eviltwin> So just use .on, it's shorter
[14:22:33] <k1ng> anyone?
[14:22:37] <kanzie> Eviltwin: hmm, then Im doing something wrong cause I did just that and it doesn't work
[14:22:41] <Eviltwin> And now I need to go buy some food
[14:22:45] <Eviltwin> I'll be back in a little while
[14:26:30] <kanzie> Eviltwin: ah, I was using a variable to set element that fires trigger, seems that don't work. It needs to know which element at instansiation
[14:28:10] <kanzie> Eviltwin: And when you type correctly you realize that I am full of shit! :-)
[14:37:49] <khorn> anyone have an idea why a $.post() callback wouldn't fire when the http request returns successfully (200)
[14:37:52] <khorn> ?
[14:40:43] <hightekvagabond> khorn: are you sure it isn't firing? I have thought sometimes my success wasn't firing but putting a console.log on the first line of the function proved that it was
[14:41:50] <khorn> I've tried removing everything from the callback except a console.log() and an alert();
[14:41:53] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ khorn
[14:41:54] <bot-t> khorn, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:44:21] <Chopps> Hi guys, i need help validating a form, i have the form with a lot of inputs of diff types, but i only show 2 inputs at the beginning (1 type text and the other a select, the rest of the inputs are hidden .hide()) so depending of the user choose on the select the other inputs will appear (fadeIn()), the thing is i have an onsubmit function, and when ever i call it it will validate the whole form, not only whats visible, any tips on how to validate it??
[14:45:04] <Eviltwin> kanzie: Can you paste your code to jsFiddle or pastebin?
[14:45:23] <khorn> I've managed to get a .ajaxError handler to fire...
[14:47:05] <Eviltwin> khorn: Did you paste your code somewhere?
[14:49:27] <Pookz> is there a cap on how much data i can send through post?
[14:49:32] <Eviltwin> Pookz: No
[14:49:48] <Pookz> So I can post a whole entire xml document through javascript?
[14:49:55] <hightekvagabond> Pookz: sometimes there is at the server level
[14:50:10] <khorn> Eviltwin: js code pasted above...lemme find it again
[14:50:30] <khorn> eviltwin: http://dpaste.com/662916/
[14:51:19] <Eviltwin> Out of curiosity, is there any reason you aren't just using $.ajax?
[14:51:27] <Eviltwin> (Not that that's the problem)
[14:51:41] <josefrichter> could you please recommend a plain javascript or jquery plugin for a day calendar? ie. displaying a single day with its 24 hours, displaying items within that day, creating and moving items, etc.
[14:51:49] <khorn> ok, apparently JSON.parse doesn't like something coming back from the server
[14:52:15] <ravenzz> because of the short doc i guess :p
[14:52:18] <khorn> Eviltwin: debugging someone else's code...
[14:52:19] <Eviltwin> khorn: You should be able to use Firebug or whatever to see the data that came down
[14:52:37] <khorn> Eviltwin: yeah, it looked fine to me...but I'm looking closer now
[14:52:52] <hightekvagabond> Pookz: more than likely….. only time I ever ran into post limits was with php and it was uploading digital signage data… huge files… would have to be pretty amazing xml to hoark the server
[14:53:38] <Pookz> hightekvagabond: Thanks, definitely won't be dealing with anything that big
[14:54:47] <hightekvagabond> btw: fyi, perl doesn't have the same file size limites as php, and php has a config to increase it in php.ini…. just in case you were curious  ;)
[14:56:04] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: It's generally a good idea to have some reasonable limit in place
[14:56:18] <Eviltwin> Otherwise an attacker could fill up your drive
[14:56:52] <Eviltwin> Who still has questions?
[14:57:34] <Zxurian> var foo = "blah"; $(document).ready(function(){ print foo; }); ----- the docready should print out "blah", since the variable scope will carry down, correct?
[14:57:56] <Eviltwin> Uh, yeah but "print foo" isn't valid syntax
[14:58:26] <Zxurian> yea, wasn't worried about that, was just checking to make sure the variable scope was correct, since my variables aren't carrying down for some reason
[14:58:53] <Eviltwin> Can you paste an example of your problem?
[14:58:56] <Eviltwin> Maybe we can help
[14:59:00] <Zxurian> actually doing that just now
[14:59:06] <Zxurian> although I have a feelng the fiddle will work perfectly
[14:59:10] <Eviltwin> Heh
[14:59:32] <hightekvagabond> Eviltwin: yes, I understand the need for limits, once had someone upload all of the SunOS into his homedir…. but, in the case where I had to open it up (like I said) it was clients uploading Digital Signage material…. I needed large file sizes, and I had lots of other protections in place… but thanks for the word of caution :)
[15:01:42] <Zxurian> yeaup, fiddle works perfectly - http://jsfiddle.net/8V7sj/ AAARRRGGGHHH
[15:01:53] <xckpd7> is there an opposite of if($this).hasClass('blah'))?
[15:02:07] <xckpd7> I want to see if the wrapped set doesn't have a class
[15:02:16] <Eviltwin> Are you serious?
[15:02:28] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: why
[15:02:31] <Eviltwin> if(!($this).hasClass('blah'))...
[15:02:37] <ravenzz> xckpd7 !
[15:02:38] <ravenzz> :P
[15:02:41] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I tried that... lol
[15:02:47] <xckpd7> syntax maybe
[15:02:48] <Eviltwin> No you didn't
[15:02:57] <Eviltwin> If you tried it, it would have worked
[15:03:01] <Eviltwin> :P
[15:03:12] <ravenzz> xckpd7 you miss a parenthesis
[15:03:14] <hightekvagabond> lol
[15:03:31] <ravenzz> if (!($this).hasClass('blah'))
[15:04:41] <thinkt4nk> did you try if (!(!(!($this).hasClass("blah')))) ?
[15:06:14] <ravenzz> if (!!!!!!!!!($this).hasClass("blah'))
[15:06:17] <ravenzz> should work as well
[15:06:26] <thinkt4nk> yep
[15:06:40] <xckpd7> thanks all

[15:07:03] <ravenzz> lol
[15:07:09] <ravenzz> we were joking
[15:07:15] <thinkt4nk> :P
[15:07:15] <ravenzz> don't do that
[15:07:19] <Eviltwin> function makeTrueFalseAndFalseTrue(bool){return !bool}if(makeTrueFalseAndFalseTrue($(this).hasClass("blah'))){...} should work too

[15:14:07] <Eviltwin> I just need some of these: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004DAWFII/
[15:18:23] <catcher> I'm trying to create handlers for 3 sequential IDs with a for loop. Not going well. Is this not possible?
[15:19:06] <Eviltwin> catcher: Can you explain further?
[15:19:52] <catcher> i.e. they're called myID1, myID2, myID3 and I'm attempting for(i=1; i<=3; i++) { $('myID'+i).change(function() {
[15:20:02] <fractastical> any opinions on the best query carousel plugin? looking for a snappy text rotator for my home page.. (needs to support text/html)
[15:20:06] <Eviltwin> $("#myID"+i)
[15:20:15] <catcher> Right, sorry
[15:20:22] <Eviltwin> Is it always 3?
[15:20:24] <Eviltwin> Those t3
[15:20:26] <Eviltwin> Those 3*
[15:20:49] <catcher> It actually ends up being 4 somehow when I try to access 'x'.
[15:20:58] <catcher> But yes, same edge value for all 3.
[15:21:21] <Eviltwin> Any reason you're not doing $("#myID1, #myID2, #myID3").change(function(){...})
[15:21:47] <shoelessone> so, as you all may know, you can have jquery generate a random callback parameter "callback" which is what is used for jsonp calls.. is it possible to specify a different callback function name?
[15:22:09] <Eviltwin> shoelessone: Yes, see ? .ajax
[15:22:09] <bot-t> shoelessone, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:22:16] <catcher> Eviltwin, because each ID has an associated field that it needs to control, field names correspond to ID names (with ascending numbers like this)
[15:22:17] <Eviltwin> It's described on there
[15:22:36] <Eviltwin> catcher: Oh, are you trying to use "i" inside the loop?
[15:22:43] <catcher> Eviltwin, right-o.
[15:23:14] <catcher> Although, maybe I'd be better off with a regex match so I can skip the number..
[15:23:23] <catcher> And register them the way you suggested.
[15:23:31] <shoelessone> Eviltwin: well, I've looked and this is the bit in question:
[15:23:32] <shoelessone> "jsonp": Loads in a JSON block using JSONP. Adds an extra "?callback=?" to the end of your URL to specify the callback. Disables caching by appending a query string parameter, "_=[TIMESTAMP]", to the URL unless the cache option is set to true.
[15:23:58] <Eviltwin> catcher: Okay, once that loop finishes
[15:24:07] <shoelessone> Eviltwin: actually maye I found it
[15:24:09] <Eviltwin> catcher: "i" will be 4
[15:24:12] <shoelessone> jsonpCallback
[15:24:32] <catcher> Eviltwin, Good point, since the increment still happens..
[15:24:33] <Eviltwin> catcher: If you want each of them to have an "i" that refers to their index
[15:24:38] <Eviltwin> You need to use a closure
[15:24:39] <Eviltwin> Like this: http://pastebin.com/1K5LAQFq
[15:25:12] <catcher> oohhh, I see.. thanks Eviltwin. Is this a variable scope problem I'm experiencing?
[15:25:18] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:25:28] <catcher> cool.. so anonymous function saves the day?
[15:25:28] <Eviltwin> The only thing that creates a new scope is a function
[15:25:30] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:25:46] <catcher> Very similar to hijacking the $ variable from other libraries, eh?
[15:25:54] <Eviltwin> A little
[15:26:11] <catcher> ty Eviltwin, very helpful
[15:26:36] <fractastical> here's another question: anyway to figure out what good plugins are for a particular topic (besides simplz searching the jquery site or google) ?
[15:27:40] <Eviltwin> fractastical: http://plugins.jquery.com/
[15:27:52] <fractastical> I have seen this site :)
[15:28:00] <fractastical> but sometimes I find lots of results, many of which are crap
[15:29:41] <Eviltwin> fractastical: Maybe you should make a site for that :P
[15:30:04] <fractastical> I would if I had time to review every jQuery plugin out there
[15:30:07] <fractastical> want to help me ;)
[15:30:19] <catcher> What's the best way to do something like .next().next() ?
[15:31:00] <catcher> or am I better off with a find + regex?
[15:31:32] <Eviltwin> catcher: .nextAll().eq(1)?
[15:32:18] <catcher> ooh...
[15:33:15] <Eviltwin> .next().next() is still more computationally efficient
[15:35:48] <josefrichter> guys, how do I append div with a particular css style, please? I mean something like $('#wrapper').append($('#mynewdiv').css('foo', 'bar')); - you know what I mean?
[15:36:34] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: What?
[15:36:44] <Eviltwin> Do you want to make a new div with a particular style?
[15:36:49] <josefrichter> I don't want to do .append("<div style="foo:bar;"></div>") coz that doesn't seem to be the right way...
[15:38:44] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[15:38:51] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to the jQuery( html, props ) syntax
[15:42:30] <josefrichter> Eviltwin. thanks. so something like $('</div>', { css: 'foo:bar;'}).appendTo('body') ?
[15:43:44] <Eviltwin> I think it's "style" not "css"
[15:44:03] <daleharvey> has anyone seen a nice modification of jquery.hotkeys that allows easy capturing of key sequences
[15:44:15] <josefrichter> Eviltwin still ugggly syntax as hell, isn't it...
[15:44:27] <daleharvey> bind('keydown', 'a b c', function() ....
[15:44:40] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: How do you plan to improve it?
[15:45:24] <amh345> can anyone help me figure out why my slideshow only slides to the left once?  http://jsfiddle.net/VyU54/    all the logs in each function are showing it trigger like it should. only the image doesnt move over more than once.
[15:45:33] <k1ng> daleharvey, yeah we did
[15:46:02] <josefrichter> $('#wrapper').append($('#mynewdiv').css('foo', 'bar')); << Eviltwin
[15:47:00] <Eviltwin> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/VyU54/1/
[15:47:14] <daleharvey> k1ng: and ...?
[15:47:27] <amh345> Eviltwin: thank you.   mind me asking what you tweaked?  i don't want to miss anything
[15:47:35] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: $("#wrapper").append($("<div/>").css({foo:"bar"}))
[15:47:57] <amh345> oh -=
[15:48:02] <k1ng> daleharvey, and its useless
[15:48:02] <Eviltwin> Yup
[15:48:16] <josefrichter> Eviltwin that works or is it just your wish? :-)
[15:48:24] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: It works
[15:48:41] <josefrichter> Eviltwin thanks then. looks better.
[15:49:14] <daleharvey> er ok thanks, anyone else?
[15:49:21] <Eviltwin> ?
[15:49:58] <amh345> Eviltwin: mind me asking what it would entail to have the slideshow loop when it hits the last one?   I'm guessing i would need to get it's current position or something and see if there's anything else?  off not reload?
[15:50:54] <Eviltwin> amh345: Something like that and you'll probably want to duplicate the first item
[15:51:08] <Eviltwin> Or shuffle the items around
[15:51:24] <k1ng> daleharvey, its better to do something like blind('keydown', function(e) { if(e.which == 13) { console.log('yay') } });
[15:51:43] <amh345> Eviltwin: ok, thank you
[15:52:34] <bl4ckcomb> given that parameters could be overridden in the constructor (JSON parameter) of the plugin and with markup (data-* attributes in the element). which one should I give priority when initializing the plugin?
[15:52:38] <daleharvey> than bind('keydown', 'enter', function() { console.log('yay'); }) ? yeh I dont really think it is, and that wasnt the question I was asking
[15:52:40] <bl4ckcomb> *the highest
[15:53:34] <AlainJacomet> Hi, any ideas why isn't this working ? jQuery("#Logo").replaceWith( "<div id=\"Logo\">" + $(this).contents() + "</div>" );
[15:54:30] <daleharvey> this will be bound to whatever the context its in, not the selector
[15:54:32] <bl4ckcomb> AlainJacomet, are you expecting $(this) to refer to $('#logo') ?
[15:54:37] <Eviltwin> AlainJacomet: Try this instead $("#Logo").replaceWith($("<div id=\"Logo\"/>).append($(this).contents());
[15:54:54] <Eviltwin> I missed a closing paren there
[15:55:16] <daleharvey> pretty sure that will have the same context?
[15:55:39] <AlainJacomet> thanks Eviltwin
[15:56:43] <daleharvey> var $logo = $('#logo'); $logo.replaceWith($('<div id="logo"></div>').append($logo.contents())); ?
[15:57:58] <AlainJacomet> & whats the syntax for adding several attributes to an element ? jquery(#).attr({"attr1","prop1"},{"attr2","prop2"}) ?
[15:58:21] <Eviltwin> .attr({"attr1":"value1","attr2":"value2"})
[15:58:35] <AlainJacomet> thank you

[16:09:15] <JesperA> :P
[16:25:38] <sparuvu> can someone help me to understand why this is not working ? http://jsfiddle.net/pBNL5/8/
[16:26:29] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: You mean why the delegate isn't working?
[16:26:42] <sparuvu> yes
[16:26:49] <Eviltwin> That's because that's not how delegate works
[16:26:58] <sparuvu> I am sorry I was not clear
[16:27:11] <Eviltwin> If you want it to seem like live, use $(document).delegate("a.ask","click",function(){...})
[16:27:57] <sparuvu> how can use delegate without using document as scope
[16:28:07] <Eviltwin> Why not document?
[16:28:24] <sparuvu> lets say in my html there are more anchor tags
[16:28:34] <sparuvu> and I want to bind only to certain anchors
[16:28:58] <sparuvu> so I want to give a class and bind a click event using delegate
[16:29:05] <sparuvu> am I clear ?
[16:29:16] <JesperA> CLEAR
[16:29:31] <Eviltwin> I'm guessing that you're not understanding how delegate works
[16:29:40] <sparuvu> hmmmm
[16:29:51] <Eviltwin> So if you do $("a"), that builds a collection of all of the A tags currently in the DOM
[16:30:10] <Eviltwin> So if you do $("a").bind("click",function(){...})
[16:30:12] <sparuvu> what I understood is delegates are like perfect replacement for live if we want to execute live in a particular scope
[16:30:19] <Eviltwin> That binds to all A tags that are currently in the DOM
[16:30:29] <Eviltwin> If you add more A tags after
[16:30:31] <sparuvu> correct
[16:30:35] <Eviltwin> They won't be caught by that listener
[16:30:48] <Eviltwin> So we call $("a") static
[16:31:02] <Eviltwin> And bind is static there
[16:31:10] <sparuvu> yes. So if we wantto bind al the a's which will be added later, we use live or delegate
[16:31:12] <sparuvu> isnt it ?
[16:31:18] <Eviltwin> Now when you use live
[16:31:26] <Eviltwin> $("a").live("click",function(){...})
[16:31:31] <Eviltwin> It uses "a" as a dynamic selector
[16:31:47] <Eviltwin> It responds to all A tags current and future
[16:31:58] <Eviltwin> Delegate does a combination
[16:32:18] <Eviltwin> So instead of $("[static]").bind("click",function(){...})
[16:32:29] <Eviltwin> Or $("[dynamic]").live("click",function(){...})
[16:32:50] <Eviltwin> You do $("[static]").delegate("[dynamic]","click",function(){...})
[16:33:03] <Eviltwin> Where [static] [dynamic] is the whole selector
[16:33:36] <Eviltwin> So for example $("table").delegate("a","click",function(){...})
[16:33:48] <Eviltwin> It binds to every table currently in the DOM (static)
[16:34:00] <shesek> Eviltwin, `live` and `delegate` are both being deprecated and replaced by `on`
[16:34:01] <Eviltwin> And responds to clicks on A tags inside them (dynamically)
[16:34:08] <shesek> Eviltwin, you should probably explain that to newcomers
[16:34:26] <Eviltwin> shesek: .live is deprecated
[16:34:28] <Eviltwin> .delegate is not
[16:34:38] <Eviltwin> Because it's just another syntax .on
[16:35:09] <ShaunR> whats wrong with this? $('#dialog_additem input[name=item_name]').val();
[16:35:13] <Eviltwin> shesek: The problem is that .on does the functionality of .bind, .live, and .delegate
[16:35:19] <shesek> Eviltwin, `on` is going to be used for the functionality `bind`, `live` and `delegate` used to provide
[16:35:20] <Eviltwin> Which are all three different concepts
[16:35:42] <Eviltwin> So it's much easier to explain the three concepts with three different names
[16:36:14] <Eviltwin> And unfortunately a lot of people are still using <1.7
[16:36:15] <shesek> well, `live` is an easy one - its a stupid concept that never should've existed
[16:36:30] <shesek> and `bind` vs `delegate` on the new `on` is just an extra parameter
[16:36:30] <Eviltwin> shesek: I know and that's why it's deprecated and .bind and .delegate are not
[16:36:52] <daleharvey> whats the easiest way to provide the current scope to a bind()
[16:37:09] <shesek> daleharvey, define "easiest"?
[16:37:15] <daleharvey> my callback is defined in a different scope
[16:37:45] <Eviltwin> daleharvey: .bind("click",function(){/*I have access to the scope*/outsideCallbackFunction(/*scope variables*/)})
[16:38:20] <shesek> daleharvey, three ways, basically - using ES5's (or a shim) func.bind(context), using a standalone bind() function like _.bind and $.proxy and setting a variable in the parent scope with a reference to this (usually `that` or `self`)
[16:38:57] <daleharvey> well I was hoping like bind(this, 'event', callback) , whatever means I dont need to rewrite all the events with lots of factory type code
[16:39:38] <Eviltwin> daleharvey: Why don't you show what you're trying to do in a pastebin or jsFidle?
[16:40:05] <shesek> daleharvey, $(...).bind('event', callback.bind(context)), $(..).bind('event', $.proxy(callback, context)), that=this; $(..).bind('event', function() { /* use that */ });
[16:40:28] <shesek> I might misremember the argument order for $.proxy
[16:40:39] <Eviltwin> ?.proxy
[16:40:40] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[16:40:42] <Eviltwin> That order
[16:40:44] <shesek> and callback.bind(context) only exists since ES5, to support ES3 you're gonna have to add a shim
[16:40:48] <Tobbi> Hey. Can anyone tell me why http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1388844 bails out with the error message 'o is null' ?
[16:41:44] <daleharvey> http://pastebin.me/a8b9aa8aa667ba4732a010928e0404eb would be an example
[16:41:44] <shesek> something like Function.prototype.bind||(Function.prototype.bind = function(context) {  var func = this; return function() { return func.apply(context, argumnts); }   });
[16:41:59] <shesek> s/argumnts/arguments
[16:42:10] <daleharvey> shesek: thanks a lot
[16:43:03] <shesek> do note that this shim doesn't support binding arguments to the function ("currying") - only the first argument for setting the context
[16:44:09] <shesek> you welcome
[16:45:45] <shesek> daleharvey, also, binding, especially when not natively supported by the browser, is slower than using a variable keep a reference to it (those `that` or `self` variable)
[16:45:57] <shesek> keep that in mind too
[16:47:57] <Chopps> Hi guys, i need help validating a form, i have the form with a lot of inputs of diff types, but i only show 2 inputs at the beginning (1 type text and the other a select, the rest of the inputs are hidden .hide()) so depending of the user choose on the select the other inputs will appear (fadeIn()), the thing is i have an onsubmit function, and when ever i call it it will validate the whole form, not only whats visible, any tips on how to validate it??
[16:48:07] <shesek> Eviltwin, I'm just saying... if someone is only learning this now, he's better off learning how to work with on() rather than deprecated APIs
[16:48:32] <Eviltwin> shesek: And as I said, .delegate and .bind are not deprecated
[16:48:49] <shesek> Eviltwin, the API is, the functionality isn't
[16:49:03] <Eviltwin> shesek: According to what?
[16:49:32] <shesek> Eviltwin, and live() isn't really deprecated in that way either - you can still listen to events on the document level if you really want to
[16:49:39] <shesek> hmm, let me find you a link
[16:49:50] <Eviltwin> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated."
[16:49:54] <Eviltwin> From the .live page
[16:50:04] <Eviltwin> .bind and .delegate do not have that
[16:51:30] <sindresorhus> Eviltwin: It's recommended to use .on() since it's shorter and the .bind and .delegate will be removed eventually, but not in the far future.
[16:52:07] <shesek> sindresorhus, a post on jQuery's blog / one of the lead developers suggested otherwise
[16:52:11] <coldhead> we'll all be dead in our cold cold graves before then
[16:52:29] <shesek> definitely not going to be removed in the near future, but it is planned to kill them at some point
[16:52:47] <shesek> (IIRC, I can't seem to find it right now)
[16:53:04] <Eviltwin> I haven't seen anything on .bind and .delegate being removed ever
[16:53:18] <sindresorhus> shesek: bind() and delegate() is now just a short alias to on() internally, so it litteraly only takes a few lines, so it will in jQuery for a long time. But I'm sure it will be removed eventually, maybe in jQuery 5.0.
[16:53:24] <shesek> the docs on delegate do mention "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method", and the docs on .bind() mention "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[16:54:03] <Eviltwin> And I'm not disagreeing with the fact that .on is preferred in 1.7+
[16:54:10] <shesek> I'm almost sure I have read, on an authoritative source, that it is planned to kill them
[16:54:45] <shesek> My Google-fu isn't at best after being awake for >40 hours :-\
[16:54:58] <botfather> hehe
[16:55:14] <botfather> used todo that
[16:55:31] <botfather> but now im too old lol
[17:01:19] * shesek can't find it :-(
[17:02:16] <Eviltwin> That's because it doesn't exist :P
[17:03:15] <shesek> that's the thing... I'm //sure// I've read it
[17:03:27] <shesek> and I'm sure it was somewhere authoritative
[17:04:08] <shesek> well... never mind I guess :S
[17:05:08] <shesek> but it is fair to say that the usage of anything other than on() is discouraged, plus its slower because its delegating internally to on() anyhow
[17:05:42] <Eviltwin> And I encourage the use of .on for 1.7+
[17:05:46] <Eviltwin> But when explaining the concept
[17:05:55] <Eviltwin> "The on where you can put that selector in there but it's bound to the document"
[17:06:02] <Eviltwin> Is a lot more of a mouthful than the "live syntax"
[17:06:56] <sindresorhus> Eviltwin: Maybe, but in almost every case, delegating the event is better than live.
[17:06:57] <shesek> well, I don't think it should even be mentioned to anyone that live() ever existed... people will always be looking for the simplest solution rather than think
[17:07:17] <Eviltwin> I don't bring .live up unless they already have
[17:07:32] <Eviltwin> At which point it's far better to explain why not to use it rather than to say "don't use it"
[17:07:34] <shesek> much easier to just do an $(...).live(...) / $(document).live(...) rather than think on a more proper place to do that
[17:08:04] <shesek> blahs, the second one was supposed to be $(document).on(...)
[17:08:14] <shesek> hmm, yeah, that's a fair argument
[17:08:28] <shesek> haven't seen the whole discussion with him either
[17:17:35] <black_warlock> how can i protect strings of .load ?
[17:17:47] <coderzach> protect?
[17:17:54] <black_warlock> yep
[17:18:07] <Eviltwin> What does that mean?
[17:18:13] <black_warlock> usually the .load() has link with qyertstrings
[17:18:16] <Chopps> Hi guys, i need help validating a form, i have the form with a lot of inputs of diff types, but i only show 2 inputs at the beginning (1 type text and the other a select, the rest of the inputs are hidden .hide()) so depending of the user choose on the select the other inputs will appear (fadeIn()), the thing is i have an onsubmit function, and when ever i call it it will validate the whole form, not only whats visible, any tips on how to validate it??
[17:18:55] <black_warlock> hehe
[17:19:02] <black_warlock> wrong method !
[17:19:18] <black_warlock> write your form inside another page
[17:19:48] <black_warlock> all forms also if hiddens are submitted
[17:19:53] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Do you use a selector to get the inputs?
[17:20:01] <coderzach> Chopps: validate it on change or onblur
[17:20:01] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: But he only wants to validate the visible ones
[17:20:05] <black_warlock> i use that trick to avoid the spamming from robots
[17:20:08] <Eviltwin> Err
[17:20:23] <Chopps> i loop throught the inputs,
[17:20:47] <Chopps> i have 2 validation methods, one onchange and another one onsubmit
[17:21:04] <Eviltwin> Chopps: You might be interested in this: http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[17:21:39] <black_warlock> did you try by blocking inputs ?
[17:22:25] <Chopps> no black_warlock, i havent, but i cant do it, i need to just show 1 set of inputs depending on the user selection
[17:22:40] <black_warlock> disable
[17:23:13] <Chopps> ty for that link Eviltwin hope it helps
[17:25:03] <black_warlock> i did it in another way
[17:25:49] <black_warlock> i put the input fields inside an hidden div outside the form
[17:26:49] <black_warlock> and call them by loading the specific <div id="input1"> inside the form tags
[17:27:59] <Chopps> how u do that? appendTo() ??
[17:30:34] <black_warlock> .load
[17:31:27] <Chopps> ok, ty, i will try both ways
[17:34:35] <black_warlock> sec making a fiddle
[17:34:51] <Chopps> awesome :D
[17:36:36] <juha_> win 14
[17:36:39] <juha_> fuck
[17:37:04] <Eviltwin> juha_: Meta-R
[17:40:51] <fission6> how do i toggle the visibily of a div which has inline-block;
[17:41:30] <Eviltwin> fission6: Look at the docs for hide and show
[17:41:35] <Eviltwin> It tells you exactly what they're doing
[17:42:15] <fission6> i am reading but how would i default a div to hide?
[17:42:32] <sparuvu> in this code the onclick event is not firing in touch devices……http://jsfiddle.net/pBNL5/11/
[17:42:33] <black_warlock> yep
[17:42:33] <Eviltwin> Give it a display: none
[17:42:55] <black_warlock> i was thinking the same , have you tried hiding the div ?
[17:43:24] <fission6> Eviltwin: if i do that then it wont have display:inline-block
[17:43:28] <black_warlock> but also if div is hidden , the form will submit the field
[17:44:14] <Eviltwin> fission6: Because you don't want to display it as an inline-block
[17:44:18] <Eviltwin> You don't want to display it at all
[17:45:24] <sparuvu> Eviltwin:  can you help me with this one…. the delegate is working fine in my laptop but not on touch devices….http://jsfiddle.net/pBNL5/11/
[17:46:09] <fission6> i want to have it initially hidden with display:none, and i want it to be shown with display:inline-block;
[17:47:59] <Eviltwin> fission6: What do .hide() and .show() actually do?
[17:48:00] <black_warlock> watch this
[17:48:01] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/F4Q4A/
[17:48:03] <Eviltwin> It says right on the doc page
[17:48:40] <black_warlock> $("#input1").load("samepage.htm #input1h");
[17:49:09] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: See http://jsfiddle.net/vLdyc/ and http://jsfiddle.net/vLdyc/1/
[17:49:29] <fission6> Eviltwin: i understamd whats happening, i am trying to understand how to circumvent it
[17:49:38] <Eviltwin> fission6: What is happening
[17:49:44] <Eviltwin> How else could you write .hide() and .show()?
[17:50:59] <black_warlock> hm
[17:51:00] <fission6> when i show(), i need display:inline-block;
[17:51:10] <Eviltwin> fission6: You still didn't answer my question
[17:51:26] <snagnever> hey! i have a huge svg that i want to make itneractive with jquery. since it`s generated with GraphViz i'm planning to embed json data in a attribute. how bad or good is that?
[17:52:17] <fission6> Eviltwin: sorry ask again, i am confused
[17:52:44] <Eviltwin> How else could you write .hide() and .show()?
[17:52:54] <Eviltwin> To do the exact same thing as .hide() or the exact same thing as .show()
[17:54:35] <black_warlock> the .toggle ?
[17:54:45] <black_warlock> or slideup and down ?
[17:54:53] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/click_event_del.html
[17:54:53] <black_warlock> what you mean ?
[17:55:01] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: "It turns out that Safari on the iPhone does not support event delegation for click events, unless the click takes place on a link or input. That’s an annoying bug, but fortunately there’s a workaround available."
[17:55:07] <fission6> im sorry i am not following
[17:55:47] <black_warlock> but Eviltwin the show/hide method will not prevent the input field submission
[17:55:48] <Eviltwin> fission6: Go to http://api.jquery.com/show/ and read after "This is roughly equivalent to calling"
[17:56:05] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: I'm not talking about preventing input field submission
[17:56:20] <Eviltwin> fission6: Go to http://api.jquery.com/hide/ and read after "This is roughly equivalent to calling"
[17:56:37] <sparuvu> Eviltwin: so is it that delegate dont work for li's ????
[17:57:00] <fission6> i get whats happening. i am not sure you understand my question
[17:59:12] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: Read that link
[17:59:28] <ryanneufeld> fission6: what's the confusion
[17:59:52] <Eviltwin> fission6: Since you have still failed to answer
[17:59:55] <fission6> i want to show and hide an element with inline-block; and have an initial display:none;
[18:00:01] <fission6> for a div
[18:00:11] <ryanneufeld> fission6: Did you read what Eviltwin suggested you read?
[18:00:20] <Eviltwin> .hide() can be roughly accomplished by .css('display', 'none') and .show() can be roughly accomplished by .css('display', 'block')
[18:00:28] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: hang on buddy
[18:00:37] <ryanneufeld> some critical thinking on this guys part could go a long away :p
[18:00:44] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: It's taking too long
[18:00:53] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: NMP, NYP
[18:01:03] <Eviltwin> I steered him to the sentence on the page
[18:01:05] <sparuvu> Eviltwin: I am sorry the link passed by the time I came back to IRC. Thanks again for helping. You made my day.  Thank you
[18:01:20] <Eviltwin> sparuvu: You're welcome
[18:03:54] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yeah, but you can't do the work for everyone
[18:04:29] <fission6> well, i should explain that i am using fade in and fade out not show and hide
[18:04:49] <Eviltwin> Yeah that would have been an important detail
[18:05:29] <ryanneufeld> fission6: see, now that's a useful bit of information
[18:07:31] <Eviltwin> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/qcJnR/
[18:07:42] <fission6> one sec
[18:07:50] <Eviltwin> Is that what you're aiming for?
[18:10:00] <Dr4g> Looking to hire a skilled front-end guy (html,css,jquery) to do some minor work for the company. Any takers?
[18:10:29] <Eviltwin> Dr4g: I imagine anyone would want a few more particulars than that
[18:10:45] <Administrator_> hi
[18:10:53] <black_warlock> it works
[18:10:58] <black_warlock> i ve tested it
[18:10:58] <Dr4g> Eviltwin: if you're available for hire. Ping me on PM to discuss more.
[18:11:08] <Administrator_> how do I run a function after 5 s? is setTimeout the right way?
[18:11:12] <Chopps> black_warlock, any news on that jsfiddle u were making?
[18:11:16] <Eviltwin> Administrator_: Generally
[18:11:31] <black_warlock> yep but you have to understand what i did
[18:12:26] <Chopps> i always try to understand before implement, if not, no use tbh, i want to learn
[18:12:28] <black_warlock> capy and paste the code i wrote inside a new page test.htm , load the jq lib and the script
[18:12:35] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/F4Q4A/
[18:13:33] <black_warlock> when you click the check field the input "name" will appear in position inside the form
[18:14:21] <black_warlock> if you uncheck the field you will see that input wil not be submitted
[18:15:44] <Eviltwin> Checkboxes are sent <name>=yes if checked
[18:15:48] <Eviltwin> They are not sent otherwise
[18:16:23] <black_warlock> yes but just because i load an empty div if unchecked
[18:16:49] <black_warlock> and the input field "name" is not loaded inside the form
[18:17:07] <fission6> Eviltwin: that looks legit thanks
[18:17:39] <Administrator_> ok so why does this funcion http://jsfiddle.net/q5W4F/ execute immidietaly
[18:17:47] <Administrator_> and not after 5s
[18:17:53] <Administrator_> ?
[18:20:11] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: Because you have made a classic mistake
[18:20:18] <Eviltwin> The difference between referring to a function and running a function
[18:20:50] <lilmikey> right
[18:20:59] <lilmikey> so how should i run it?
[18:21:16] <Eviltwin> How do you run a function named foo?
[18:21:47] <Chopps> black_warlock, $("#input1").load("test.htm #input1h"); this copies the content of element #input1h from test.html and inserts it on #input1 ??
[18:22:04] <black_warlock> yep
[18:22:17] <black_warlock> you can normalize the script
[18:22:34] <black_warlock> can remove the hidden divs and call stright the input id
[18:23:06] <black_warlock> instead of #input1h  call  stright #name
[18:23:12] <lilmikey> $(function foo() {})
[18:23:15] <lilmikey> ?
[18:23:30] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: No
[18:23:38] <Eviltwin> Looks like you need to learn JavaScript
[18:23:39] <lilmikey> foo(); ?
[18:23:46] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:24:01] <Eviltwin> How do you refer to a function named foo?
[18:24:03] <lilmikey> isnt that what i wrote in my script?
[18:24:07] <lilmikey> jesus.
[18:24:22] <lilmikey> dude, please correct my error.
[18:24:26] <Chopps> ok, ty black_warlock i think that will be enough to achieve what i want :D
[18:24:37] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: I'm trying to help you learn how to solve this problem on your own in the future
[18:24:40] <black_warlock> did you test it ?
[18:25:05] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: But if you'd rather have to come running here everytime something doesn't work
[18:25:08] <Eviltwin> Fine by me
[18:25:15] <Eviltwin> There won't always be someone here to help on your schedule
[18:25:20] <Eviltwin> Your error is fixed here: http://jsfiddle.net/q5W4F/3/
[18:25:34] <black_warlock> you can put all the input fields you need inside an hidden div OUTSIDE THE FORM and then call em 1 by 1 when you need em
[18:25:44] <black_warlock> inside the form
[18:25:46] <lilmikey> ok, thanks
[18:26:17] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: setTimeout takes a reference to a function
[18:26:39] <lilmikey> yea.
[18:26:41] <Eviltwin> setTimeout(resizetime(),5000) is the same as doing var temp = resizetime(); setTimeout(temp,5000)
[18:26:51] <Eviltwin> So resizetime gets run right away
[18:26:55] <fission6> thanks again Eviltwin
[18:27:02] <Eviltwin> fission6: You're welcome
[18:27:39] <_adnasa_> Eviltwin, I don't think () is needed inside the setTimeout function
[18:27:47] <lilmikey> ok then
[18:27:51] <Eviltwin> _adnasa_: Depends on what you're trying to do
[18:28:08] <lilmikey> but when i set a var
[18:28:08] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: I'm hoping that if you understand the problem, you'll be able to spot it in the future
[18:28:27] <_adnasa_> don't mean to confuse anyone :-)
[18:28:28] <lilmikey> var temp = function (){ something };
[18:28:38] <lilmikey> and then
[18:28:41] <Eviltwin> temp is now a refence to a function
[18:28:42] <lilmikey> temp;
[18:28:53] <Eviltwin> So you would do setTimeout(temp,5000) is you wanted to run that function 5 seconds from now
[18:29:10] <_adnasa_> yes
[18:29:13] <lilmikey> yea, but whats the () after the function then
[18:29:22] <Eviltwin> That's how you run a function
[18:29:31] <Eviltwin> Execute it with no arguments
[18:29:31] <lilmikey> as in function () { sth }
[18:29:39] <Eviltwin> Oh there?
[18:29:42] <Eviltwin> That's how you specify arguments
[18:29:48] <lilmikey> ok
[18:29:56] <Eviltwin> function foo(a,b,c){ return a+b*c;}
[18:30:05] <Eviltwin> foo(1,2,3) will return 7
[18:31:02] <lilmikey> so basically temp (a) is the same as function (a) { sth }     if var temp = function () { sth }
[18:31:24] <Eviltwin> Nope
[18:31:49] <lilmikey> ?
[18:31:51] <Eviltwin> function foo(a,b,c) { return a+b*c; }
[18:31:54] <Eviltwin> var bar = foo;
[18:32:03] <imsky> Eviltwin you sexy haxor
[18:32:03] <Eviltwin> foo(1,2,3) will do the same thing as bar(1,2,3)
[18:32:19] <Eviltwin> Or var foo = function(a,b,c) { return a+b*c; }
[18:32:23] <_adnasa_> lol
[18:32:27] <Eviltwin> bar bar = foo;
[18:33:08] <lilmikey> right. so if I do () after a reference to a function, I will execute it. and thats all "()" stands for after the reference.
[18:33:24] <Eviltwin> Run with no arguments, yes
[18:33:36] <Eviltwin> Not to be confused with the () in function () { ... }
[18:33:42] <lilmikey> yea.
[18:33:44] <Eviltwin> Which specifies what arguments the anonymous function accepts
[18:33:49] <black_warlock> cant you use .delay () ?
[18:33:54] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: For what?
[18:34:04] <Eviltwin> For this?
[18:34:09] <lilmikey> thats only for a queue
[18:34:44] <Eviltwin> lilmikey's right, it doesn't work here
[18:34:45] <lilmikey> as in $(object).css(sth).delay(5000).animate(sth);
[18:35:08] <lilmikey> ok. when we're at it
[18:35:33] <lilmikey> what the difference in using $ before vars name, and not using it?
[18:35:44] <lilmikey> var $temp =     and var temp =
[18:35:44] <Eviltwin> Nothing
[18:36:00] <Eviltwin> Some people just use that as a way of reminding themselves its a jQuery collection
[18:36:11] <lilmikey> ok.
[18:36:19] <Eviltwin> Others do it because they came from languages where all the vars had $'s in front of them
[18:36:22] <Eviltwin> So they just in that habit
[18:36:26] <Eviltwin> they're*
[18:36:37] <coldhead> morons
[18:36:49] <Eviltwin> More like cowards
[18:36:54] <Eviltwin> Not willing to risk using a reserved word!
[18:40:17] <Eviltwin> So I think that solves everyone's problems for the evening
[18:41:19] <hightekvagabond> it's not really cowardly…. it makes the code more readable because at a glance you can see what is and isn't a variable… problem is that JavaScript really kinda blurs the lines so much on variables that it doesn't help much
[18:41:50] <Eviltwin> How does it blur the line on variables?
[18:42:22] <coldhead> for (aids in lol)
[18:42:28] <coldhead> for and in look variablish
[18:42:41] <Eviltwin> You're right, that's the problem
[18:42:48] <hightekvagabond> The whole functions are variables thing is weird and blurs the lines
[18:42:49] <Eviltwin> It should be $for (aids $in lol)
[18:42:57] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: And useful
[18:43:17] <coldhead> it's because JS is halfway towards lisp
[18:43:21] <coldhead> where everything is code and data
[18:43:34] <coldhead> and that's not even glancing at macro weirdness
[18:44:06] <Dr4g> hi coldhead :)
[18:44:09] <juha_> coldhead!
[18:44:16] <coldhead> hello fellas
[18:44:34] <juha_> i bought a fucking monocle today.
[18:44:45] <Dr4g> Anyone looking for small bits of work (html,css,jquery)? Max up to 8 hour per week.
[18:45:23] <lilmikey> dr4g sure
[18:45:31] <Dr4g> lilmikey: pm me :)
[18:46:08] <juha_> i'm looking for ppl also, max up to 40 hours a week
[18:48:32] <coldhead> a fucking monocle, juha_? what the hell
[18:48:53] <juha_> yes. monocle that fucks
[18:49:09] <juha_> but i bought it because i'm an awesome gentleman
[18:49:12] <bribroder> hey guys, quick one. can you explain the syntax used in the #1 answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3471973/jquery-text-change-on-toggle
[18:50:00] <Eviltwin> bribroder: What about it?
[18:50:08] <Eviltwin> The ?: thing?
[18:50:14] <bribroder> yeah, that
[18:50:25] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:
[18:51:03] <bribroder> oh, neat
[18:51:24] <black_warlock> without to ask the setTimeout solved me a prob :P
[18:51:25] <Eviltwin> true ? a : b evaluates to a
[18:51:30] <Eviltwin> false ? a : b evalutes to b
[18:51:49] <Eviltwin> So x ? a : b will give a if x is true and b if x is false
[18:51:53] <black_warlock> but i dont understand something
[18:51:58] <bribroder> can it handle if/else?
[18:52:07] <bribroder> a : b : c?
[18:52:16] <Eviltwin> You mean else if?
[18:52:22] <bribroder> yeah :)
[18:52:28] <bl4ckcomb> just nest a ? b : c
[18:52:32] <bl4ckcomb> but that's fugly
[18:52:53] <Eviltwin> bribroder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:#.3F:_in_style_guidelines
[18:53:05] <Eviltwin> Look at the vehicle example
[18:53:10] <bribroder> agreed on the fugly
[18:53:28] <black_warlock> why $(this) doesnt work inside the setTimeout ?
[18:53:43] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: What would it refer to?
[18:54:02] <black_warlock> im using some jq for the validation
[18:54:12] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/gdXye/1/
[18:54:24] <bribroder> thanks much, Eviltwin
[18:55:06] <bribroder> hardest thing in the world to google
[18:55:09] <bribroder> ?:
[18:55:10] <bot-t> the elvis operator
[18:55:12] <Eviltwin> bribroder: Yup
[18:56:14] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: If you want to preserve the this inside the setTimeout, you need to either do setTimeout($.proxy(function(){...},this),500) or var that=this; setTimeout(function(){...},500) and use "that" inside the function instead of "this"
[18:57:08] <black_warlock> right , i did also an error
[18:57:29] <black_warlock> i ve setted the time out only when the input user is not empty
[18:58:05] <black_warlock> should have made a function for that
[18:58:57] <coldhead> what's with the monocle
[19:12:54] <hobs> :monocle:
[19:15:58] <t0ny-p40> How do I test if file is the database from a template? {% if i.thumb|length > 0 %} or {% i.thumb %} is always true for me.
[19:20:17] <Eviltwin> t0ny-p40: What?
[19:20:49] <t0ny-p40> Eviltwin: I have a ImageField and I'm trying to test if there is anything in it.
[19:20:58] <t0ny-p40> From a template.
[19:21:37] <t0ny-p40> {% if i.thumb|length > 0 %}/files/media/{{ i.thumb }}{% else %}/images/unknown-plane.jpg{% endif %}
[19:21:59] <t0ny-p40> I'm trying that but it is always true. Also I tried it without the |legnth > 0
[19:23:03] <Guest64105> is there any js framework that can offer some cross-browser string, array manupulation?
[19:23:10] <Guest64105> and override property like .textContent and innerText, make default properties and functions cross-browser?
[19:23:22] <crab> t0ny-p40: what is an ImageField?
[19:23:55] <crab> oh. seems to be some sort of Drupal thing.
[19:23:59] <t0ny-p40> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/fields/#imagefield
[19:24:13] <t0ny-p40> Err. I'm stupid. I'm in #jquery.
[19:24:18] <t0ny-p40> lol sorry.
[19:24:21] <Eviltwin> Fail
[19:25:16] <crab> henceforth you will be known as t0ny-p39
[19:25:26] <crab> ;-)
[19:26:01] <t0ny-p40> And my net just quit.
[19:26:51] <Casey> I have a question. How can I .append() an element with itself?
[19:27:02] <crab> don't do that.
[19:27:10] <Casey> I need to duplicate it
[19:27:10] <Eviltwin> Casey: Why would you want to?
[19:27:11] <raenger> *implosion*
[19:27:17] <crab> Casey: .clone()
[19:27:26] <Casey> Thank you crab
[19:27:30] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").append($("#foo").clone())
[19:27:41] <Eviltwin> Although you'll want to change that ID
[19:28:21] <Casey> Can I use a class? I need to do this for a number of elements
[19:28:46] <crab> you can select the element to clone using any sort of selector
[19:29:07] <Casey> I'd like to keep it generic
[19:29:13] <crab> but if the element(s) have ids, you'll need to change them (if you want things to work sensibly afterwards)
[19:29:24] <crab> but: what on earth are you doing?
[19:30:25] <Casey> Trying to duplicate an image and style it separatly from the original
[19:31:50] <Casey> to make a 'reflection' but I need more control than CSS3 reflections allow
[19:32:25] <Eviltwin> Casey: Have you seen .wrap?
[19:33:00] <Eviltwin> It seems odd to want to copy the element into itself
[19:33:15] <Eviltwin> Wrapping the element in something or adding something inside of it likely makes more sense
[19:34:07] <Casey> I just need to make two elements from one and style them separately.
[19:34:31] <Eviltwin> var original = $("#foo"); var copy = $("#foo").clone();
[19:34:46] <Eviltwin> You can then append the copy object to whatever
[19:35:20] <Casey> I'll have a list of images and I'd like to apply the same jQuery and CSS to them without giving them individual ids. Is that possible?
[19:35:42] <crab> <crab> you can select the element to clone using any sort of selector
[19:36:10] <Eviltwin> Casey: Can you make a jsFiddle example of what you're trying to do?
[19:37:05] <Casey> http://jsfiddle.net/vX6GJ/
[19:37:24] <Casey> I'd like to start with only the plain divs, and add the divs with class 'dynamic' with jquery
[19:39:01] <Eviltwin> So start with this? <div>hi</div><div>there</div><div>everyone</div>
[19:39:07] <Eviltwin> And add a second copy of each after?
[19:39:23] <Casey> I'll have a list of images and I'd like to Yes, exactly.
[19:39:29] <Casey> woah
[19:39:35] <Casey> Yes, Eviltwin, exactly that.
[19:40:03] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/vX6GJ/
[19:40:23] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/vX6GJ/1/
[19:40:42] <Casey> Thank you so much Eviltwin!
[19:40:46] <Casey> That's perfect
[20:21:33] <Foxhoundz> Why is it that the .submit() method fires off twice when the user only submits a form once?
[20:22:12] <Eviltwin> What?
[20:22:15] <coldhead> it doesn't
[20:22:22] <coldhead> you might be binding it twice
[20:22:28] <coldhead> or calling it recursively
[20:22:43] <coldhead> or your computer has 2 CPUs and does things twice
[20:22:53] <coldhead> because i assume that's what dual core is all about
[20:23:46] <lilmikey> hi again
[20:24:01] <lilmikey> I am using scrollTo and want to prevent the flickerbug
[20:24:16] <lilmikey> and also degrade the site gracefully.
[20:24:44] <lilmikey> so when I click an the selector, I don't want it to go the anchor
[20:24:49] <lilmikey> so I use 		if (event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault(); } else { event.returnValue = false; };
[20:25:01] <lilmikey> which works everywhere but in mozilla
[20:25:40] <lilmikey> what should I do instead to make it work cross-browser?
[20:25:51] <lilmikey> that script seems to kill the function in mozilla.
[20:26:34] <lilmikey> (I use it in the beginning of the function). The script works in mozilla when it's put at the end, but that doesn't help for the flicker bug.
[20:27:18] <Eviltwin> Code?
[20:30:28] <lilmikey> wait up
[20:32:27] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/TJHX2/
[20:32:34] <lilmikey> this works, generally
[20:32:48] <lilmikey> theres a variable that isn't included
[20:32:49] <Eviltwin> Why aren't you just returning false at the end?
[20:33:03] <Eviltwin> This code looks particularly messy
[20:33:16] <lilmikey> check it out..
[20:34:00] <Eviltwin> You also have two separate $(".region-sidebar-first").width() == $(window).width()
[20:34:04] <Eviltwin> if statements
[20:34:31] <lilmikey> yea.
[20:34:38] <lilmikey> but its not the case
[20:35:20] <lilmikey> its about mozilla not obeying:
[20:35:21] <lilmikey>         if (event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault(); } else { event.returnValue = false; };
[20:35:30] <lilmikey> correctly.
[20:35:36] <igcewieling1> I am looking for ideas (or plugins) to take JSON data, gotten via an .ajax() and stuff it into form fields.  The data is in the form of {key: 'data', etc where the key matches the field name="key"
[20:35:42] <lilmikey> I can't find a better solution anywhere.
[20:35:48] <Guest64105> how do you traverse Dom and get elements which have attribute myOwnAttr = "1" ?
[20:36:10] <igcewieling1> I've tried the populate plugin, but am having issues with it and wanted to know about other options
[20:36:59] <Eviltwin> igcewieling1: $.each(jsonData,function(k,v){$("input[name='"+k+"']").val(v)})
[20:37:15] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: Why aren't you just returning false at the end?
[20:37:19] <Eviltwin> jQuery takes care of that
[20:37:49] <lilmikey> that still doesn't do it, as then mozilla just tries to return the default action
[20:38:20] <igcewieling1> Eviltwin: thanks!  I think I even understand that 8-)
[20:38:48] <coldhead> ?beauty
[20:38:48] <bot-t1> please beautify your horrible code at http://jsbeautifier.org <3
[20:39:14] <lilmikey> Eviltwin: I will put it at the end. dont really know how to solve the mozilla problem.
[20:39:38] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: I'm not sure what this Mozilla problem is
[20:40:40] <lilmikey> well, theres an href to the selector, addressing an anchor in the document. the default action is just that. the script is an animated document scroll.
[20:41:19] <lilmikey> what happens is: the screen flickers, showing me the anchor, then returns to the selector and animates scroll.
[20:41:35] <Guest64105> how do you traverse Dom and get elements which have attribute myOwnAttr = "1" ?
[20:41:38] <lilmikey> the flicker happens in a blink of an eye
[20:41:42] <lilmikey> lol
[20:41:53] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.preventDefault
[20:41:58] <lilmikey> but that happens on all browsers
[20:42:18] <Eviltwin> Guest64105: $("[myOwnAttr=1]")
[20:43:32] <igcewieling1> the populate plugin seems to handle stuff specific to forms (like checkboxes and select lists), but it generates a jquery exception and I don't know enough to think I can fix it.
[20:43:58] <Guest64105> Eviltwin: thanks..!!!
[21:05:01] <t0ny-p40> How do I check to see if a ImageField has a image in a template?
[21:05:59] <t0ny-p40> {% if i.thumb|length > 0 %} or {% if i.thumb %} always is true.
[21:20:41] <photosbyme> how do ad a prev and next button to a scroller
[21:25:06] <Eviltwin> t0ny-p40: Wrong room again
[21:25:45] <t0ny-p40> Really? Something is up with my irssi client...
[21:26:41] <t0ny-p40> I fixed my problem just now anyways.
[21:26:56] <t0ny-p40> I can't join any new channels. It just goes back to here.
[21:42:42] <Eviltwin> t0ny-p40: Maybe leave this one and join that one?
[21:43:21] <lilmikey> does any1 know scrollTo well?
[21:43:37] <lilmikey> how do I stop an animation queue in mid-animation?
[21:43:56] <lilmikey> (animation scroll queue)
[21:46:15] <Eviltwin> I just use .animate({scrollTop:...})
[21:46:44] <lilmikey> yea
[21:46:59] <lilmikey> that cant handle jquery objects though
[21:47:14] <lilmikey> how would you normally stop an animation?
[21:47:25] <lilmikey> this.stop(true)?
[21:54:52] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: So you get the scrollTop of the element you want to scroll to
[21:55:10] <lilmikey> yea, and scrollleft
[21:55:14] <lilmikey> thats right.
[21:55:16] <Eviltwin> And, yes, some variety of .stop
[21:55:32] <lilmikey> stop doesnt work in scrollTo
[21:55:44] <Eviltwin> I'm not terribly surprised
[21:56:45] <lilmikey> yea
[21:59:16] <lilmikey> ok man
[21:59:18] <lilmikey> thanks
[21:59:26] <lilmikey> im off, need a few h sleep.
[21:59:37] <lilmikey> bye
[21:59:40] <Eviltwin> Bye
[22:16:30] <amirite> how do I tell what modifier is pressed on a keypress event?
[22:16:42] <amirite> i.e. the key is PAGE_UP and i want to see if CTRL is depressed
[22:20:26] <Jak2000> Eviltwin are you there?
[22:24:29] <matthusby> hey guys, I am using the stop callback in draggable to update some dom elements, but as soon as the stop callback is finished the updates that were made are reverted.  How do I get that you stick around?
[22:27:37] <zerpex> What is the best way to determine the visitors locale time? GeoLocation / IP Lookup or?
[22:33:53] <krn0> hello
[22:34:07] <krn0> can jquery be used on a facebook page?
[22:51:44] <Eviltwin> amirite: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/KeyboardEvent
[23:08:29] <Spadeski> nyone know why when I click and try to upload soemthin with uploadify it does nothing but opens the "Choose file" dialog
[23:34:26] <oojacoboo> how can I check to see if a DOM element exists?
[23:35:02] <sanjayb> oojacoboo, $('selector').length == 0   <-- does not exist
[23:35:18] <oojacoboo> that's the best there is?
[23:36:05] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: this is what i remember from a year ago as the best :) - maybe there's something new, i maybe a bit outta touch.
[23:36:19] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Have a better idea?
[23:36:27] <oojacoboo> no
[23:36:40] <Zerpex> what is the best way to, determine a users current timezone?
[23:36:41] <Eviltwin> !!$('selector')[0] is a little shorter
[23:36:50] <oojacoboo> that just seems like it'd be a fairly common task and having to manually evaluate seems a bit archaic
[23:36:53] <oojacoboo> but w/e
[23:36:54] <megatrond> if ($('#element')) {};
[23:36:55] <megatrond> ?
[23:36:58] <Eviltwin> Zerpex: I believe the Date object is always in local time
[23:37:06] <Eviltwin> megatrond: That does not work
[23:37:08] <sanjayb> megatrond: i dont think that works?
[23:37:09] <Eviltwin> It is always true
[23:37:15] <oojacoboo> megatrond: does that work?
[23:37:19] <oojacoboo> ok
[23:37:19] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Instead of?
[23:37:20] <sanjayb> lol
[23:37:25] <megatrond> ah because of the javascript bools
[23:37:36] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: instead of??
[23:37:55] <Zerpex> Eviltwin: yeah, it's because I'm making a site in PHP, which gets content from a database, based on their browsers / systems language, but would be lovely also to get the time :P
[23:38:22] <Eviltwin> If you want to in one operation check the existence of an element, you can do if(document.getElementById('idgoeshere')) { ... }
[23:38:32] <bobbobbins> hey, im using $('#stakeholder_group').val() to get the selected value of a pulldown, but its always returning 1 which is the first value, no matter what is selected
[23:39:09] <sanjayb> bobbobbins, paste code?
[23:40:29] <megatrond> $('#stakeholder_group :selected').val() maybe?
[23:41:31] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: if($("#id")[0]) should work
[23:41:48] <oojacoboo> I'll check it out, thanks
[23:42:08] <Cork> id can only exist on one element so [0] doens't make any sence
[23:42:16] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: No matter how they implemented it, you couldn't shave more than a char off that
[23:42:18] <oojacoboo> I just thought there might be a nice function like   if(exists($('#id')))
[23:42:27] <Eviltwin> Well that wouldn't really make sense
[23:42:35] <oojacoboo> why not?
[23:42:36] <sanjayb> Zerpex: something like: d = new Date(); d.getTimezoneOffset(); <-- you'd have to read up about it tho
[23:42:37] <Cork> oojacoboo: $('#id').length > 0
[23:42:37] <Eviltwin> You can do if($("#id").length) {
[23:42:47] <Cork> oojacoboo: id is uniq on the page
[23:42:50] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Well there would have to be a global function for that
[23:42:54] <Cork> oojacoboo: its in the dom spec
[23:43:03] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yea, I know
[23:43:11] <oojacoboo> I didn't know if jquery had something nice lke that
[23:43:16] <Eviltwin> You could do $("#id").size()
[23:43:41] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: The closest thing to what your suggesting is $.isEmptyObject
[23:43:41] <oojacoboo> the point is to find out if the element exists on the page or not b/c we have logic that alerts the layout and logic that is based on DOM elements
[23:43:47] <Eviltwin> Which is still the opposite of what you want
[23:43:54] <Eviltwin> $("#id")[0] is the fest number of chars
[23:43:55] <oojacoboo> s/alerts/alters *
[23:43:59] <oojacoboo> my god :/
[23:44:03] <Eviltwin> jQuery is designed to always give you a collection
[23:44:13] <Eviltwin> And collections are objects
[23:44:21] <Eviltwin> And objects are always truthy
[23:44:26] <oojacoboo> gotcha
[23:44:28] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: sure ... not sure what the problem is though -- there's a number of really short / concise ways to get this information .. not sure what utility a .exists() or something would add ..
[23:44:41] <oojacoboo> no problem, was just asking
[23:44:41] <Eviltwin> But the benefit of that is I can do $("#id").click(function(){...})
[23:44:49] <Eviltwin> And if an element with that ID doesn't exist, it's no problem
[23:44:53] <Eviltwin> That code just doesn't do anything
[23:45:03] <Eviltwin> Which is the beauty in how jQuery works
[23:45:08] <oojacoboo> ah, I see
[23:45:12] <Eviltwin> Everything is a collection and those collections can just be empty
[23:45:16] <Eviltwin> No biggie
[23:46:45] <Eviltwin> So what you've stumbled upon is really the only thing jQuery might arguably increase the number of chars for
[23:46:56] <endra> Hey
[23:46:59] <Eviltwin> Although it's still shorter than if(document.getElementById('id'))
[23:47:11] <Eviltwin> endra: Hi
[23:47:16] <endra> Eviltwin: how's it going tonight?
[23:47:23] <Eviltwin> Fine, you?
[23:47:29] <endra> Pretty good, thanks :)
[23:48:30] <endra> I have a question: I'm doing $(selector).slideUp(500, function() { .. }); and I want that whole line to be blocking so that the lines after it do not execute until it is done
[23:49:39] <sanjayb> endra: I think you then have to put all those lines inside the callback function() { .... }) ..
[23:49:47] <Eviltwin> endra: sanjayb is correct
[23:51:53] <endra> I can't do that because I don't want the user to execute the same function twice within the slideUp delay
[23:52:29] <Eviltwin> endra: Show us what you have via pastebin or jsFiddle or something
[23:53:09] <megatrond> ie7 refuses to overflow: hidden; when animating the height of a div
[23:53:23] <Eviltwin> megatrond: ?
[23:53:56] <megatrond> have a div with a fixed height of 420px and a image thats about 600px high
[23:54:18] <megatrond> if i animate the height of the containing div to lets say 500px, ie7 ignores the overflow: hidden;
[23:54:20] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/<3_my_ide.png
[23:54:29] <endra> Eviltwin, sanjayb: http://pastebin.com/9JcwNtrJ - the user can't execute twice within 500ms because the ':last' will return the wrong one, also the form count (lines 8/9) will be invalid
[23:54:53] <iYuri> hi
[23:55:23] <iYuri> anyone knows how to hide the web page url when a page have to br printend??
[23:55:40] <iYuri> I want to do this from my html/php/css/whatever code
[23:56:40] <Eviltwin> megatrond: http://jsfiddle.net/mSEnG/
[23:56:42] <Eviltwin> Does it happen with that?
[23:56:43] <endra> iYuri: pretty sure that is browser-side
[23:57:06] <iYuri> now way to do this from my code?
[23:57:26] <endra> iYuri: I don't think so. It is an option in the printing options in the browser.
[23:57:27] <sanjayb> iYuri: i cant think of anything other than using a server side script to make a pdf of the page .. which, of course, is a whole different topic / complication.
[23:57:31] <iYuri> ok thank you
[23:57:38] <Eviltwin> endra: You still haven't explained why this can't be done in the callback
[23:57:50] <iYuri> sanjayb that was exactly my next question
[23:57:55] <iYuri> I had a look
[23:58:11] <sanjayb> iYuri: I've been using wkhtmltopdf for this kind've thing - check it out, if you like.
[23:58:18] <iYuri> but I wasn't able to find any code or source to create pdf from my page
[23:58:19] <endra> Eviltwin: because if you execute it twice within 500ms, the ':last' selector returns the same element since it was not removed yet.
[23:58:35] <Eviltwin> So don't execute it twice within 500ms
[23:58:49] <sanjayb> iYuri: google 'wkhtmltopdf' .. shud probably not go on about this since its not related to jquery :-)
[23:59:04] <iYuri> thank you sanjayb ;)
[23:59:07] <endra> Eviltwin: this doesn't solve the problem, it just avoids it
[23:59:45] <Eviltwin> What should happen if this function triggers twice quickly?
