[00:12:15] <Jungle_Jim> Hi All, I have a drop-down menu which is only one level deep. I'd like to keep the particular menu-item with it's assoc. list items visible when a user clicked on one of them i.e. like when u hover over and it then diaplays th drop-down, then clicked dropdown should stay visible - a bit like "different" bread-crumbs. Any ideas on pointers on how to do this?
[00:20:22] <defaultro__> hey guys, our code is starting to look bad. Are there any framework for jquery/javascript?
[00:25:59] <MiracleBlue> defaultro__: backbone?
[00:27:12] <ItsJustMe> I would like to do something like a text editor.. Just like adding pages (onclick), closing pages (onclick), saving them in a database and yeah .. That's it .. Maybe open and close multiple pages onclick .. May I do this with jQuery or should I look for something else?
[00:27:23] <ItsJustMe> Is jQuery powerful enough for that?
[00:27:59] <MiracleBlue> Sure
[00:28:42] <ItsJustMe> Okay, so it will be a problem of PEBKAC if it does not work :D
[00:28:48] <ItsJustMe> Thanks MiracleBlue
[00:28:52] <MiracleBlue> No worries :)
[00:29:08] <ItsJustMe> Oh, I have worries ^^
[00:29:17] <ItsJustMe> But I would love to create this editor ..
[00:29:26] <Cork> ItsJustMe: all you need is contentEditable and a serializer
[00:29:27] <ItsJustMe> So I'll just try xD
[00:29:42] <Cork> ?mdc contentEditable
[00:29:43] <bot-t> Cork, Content Editable - HTML | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable
[00:31:53] <ItsJustMe> Wow, you're just amazing .. You all :)
[00:32:39] <Cork> ItsJustMe: thats what all the different js html editors use
[00:33:08] <defaultro__> MiracleBlue: what is backbone?
[00:33:41] <MiracleBlue> defaultro__: it's a very useful JS framework :)
[00:35:57] <ItsJustMe> Cork: Is that possible? Add a new input form (on click on a div for example), let the user type something in, save this value into database, remove the input form and reload the div?
[00:36:08] <ItsJustMe> Possible with content editable and jQuery in mix?
[00:36:24] <defaultro__> thank you so much MiracleBlue :)
[00:36:26] <Cork> you don't need the input if you use contentEditable
[00:36:34] <Cork> ItsJustMe: but yes its doable
[00:36:38] <defaultro__> I'll check it tomorrow. I'm so tired today
[00:36:43] <MiracleBlue> No worries :)
[00:36:47] <Cork> you need server code to handle the storing and fetching of the date though
[00:37:19] <defaultro__> ?.backbone
[00:37:20] <ItsJustMe> That should not be a problem if it can be php :)
[00:37:21] <bot-t> defaultro__, Couldn't find ".backbone" in jQuery Docs.
[00:37:59] <defaultro__> is this it MiracleBlue , http://backbonejs.org/
[00:38:04] <MiracleBlue> Yep
[00:38:07] <Cork> ItsJustMe: then all you need is to set contentEditable on the field, let the user change it, and then have a save button that removes the contentEditable and ajax pushes the new data to the server
[00:38:19] <defaultro__> cool. I'll bookmark it
[00:38:24] <defaultro__> thanks a lot!
[00:39:16] <ItsJustMe> I'll just save onblur :)
[00:39:18] <ItsJustMe> Thanks Cork! :D
[00:44:16] <geiregjo> nasty bug ><
[00:44:27] <geiregjo> need some real jquery mobile expert
[00:44:58] <Cork> ?ask @ geiregjo
[00:44:58] <bot-t> geiregjo, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:45:53] <Trisox> morning Cork

[00:46:29] <Cork> wtf...
[00:46:31] <Trisox> how is it going tackeld the mobile stuff you talked about last time
[00:46:46] <Cork> i'm fiddeling with android 2.3 right now >_>
[00:46:58] <Trisox> ah
[00:47:05] <Cork> empty divs shifts the input overlays O_o'
[00:47:10] <Cork> (that was the wft up there)
[00:47:31] <Trisox> i found this few days back

[00:47:50] <Trisox> whoo! sorry
[00:47:57] <Trisox> might be handy ;)
[00:48:00] <Cork> nice
[00:48:02] <Cork> thx
[00:48:10] <Trisox> also http://mobilewebbestpractices.com/resources/
[00:48:13] <Cork> but this bug is really interesting
[00:48:23] <Cork> <div></div> shifts the input overlay
[00:48:25] <s0u][ight> hello, let's say some_element is assigned to an element on a page, how can I select the child of the next element to the parent element of some_element?
[00:48:28] <Trisox> ah ;)
[00:48:30] <Cork> <div> </div> doesn't >_<'
[00:48:40] <Cork> what the f's with that?
[00:49:01] <Trisox> i read about that somewhere
[00:49:24] <Cork> ?p @ s0u][ight
[00:49:24] <bot-t> s0u][ight, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:49:47] <s0u][ight> I got as far as $(some_element).parent().next() (now only need to select the first child of that
[00:50:25] <Cork> Trisox: the funniest bug i found was in android 4.1, where the style of disabled form elements affects everything below it on the form :/
[00:50:38] <Trisox> hmm thats weird
[00:51:11] <Cork> to h3 tags and input fields became something like opacity: .7;
[00:51:20] <Cork> really annoying
[00:51:30] <Trisox> thats just plain wrong :|
[00:51:33] <Cork> ya
[00:51:55] <s0u][ight> Cork: https://blackboard.ua.ac.be/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp I want to select the button with value "aanmelden" starting from the password field
[00:53:21] <Cork> s0u][ight: $('#password').closest('.clearfix').next().find('.submit')
[00:53:57] <Trisox> $('#password').closest('#loginFormList').find('.submit')
[00:53:59] <Trisox> ;)
[00:54:09] <Trisox> oh !
[00:54:28] <Cork> ya Trisox's that's even better
[00:54:44] <s0u][ight> well, that's inside a frame, so simply $('#password') won't work, but hey, thanks!
[00:55:13] <Cork> s0u][ight: the #password is just a replacement for what ever you have as a pointer for the password
[00:55:25] <Cork> +field
[00:55:27] <s0u][ight> thanks, trying right away
[00:56:25] <s0u][ight> Cork: btw, I noticed something, when I use javascript to fill data to form fields and use .submit()  it doesn't work, but with jquery .click() it works :/
[00:56:29] <Cork> Trisox: hmm one thing though the id in closest is... kinda bad
[00:56:42] <Trisox> i know...
[00:56:52] <Cork> s0u][ight: submit should work just fine
[00:57:01] <Cork> s0u][ight: as long as you don't do it in the submit event that is
[00:57:02] <Trisox> you dont need closest any who
[00:57:09] <Cork> ya
[00:57:12] <Trisox> you got id's
[00:57:33] <Cork> and i would prob prefer to do it like $('#password').closest('form').find('.submit')
[00:57:50] <Cork> that way its form inbound by the form id
[00:57:57] <s0u][ight> Cork: Trisox great, it works thanks a lot
[00:58:00] <s0u][ight> !!!
[00:58:01] <Cork> *that way its not inbound by the form id
[00:58:11] <Trisox> agreed Cork
[00:58:33] <Trisox> but i wonder if he even uses it on that level
[00:59:13] <Cork> true many pages is id additives
[00:59:22] <Trisox> :-)
[01:00:54] <Cork> only place where i'm VERY addicive to id's is on form elements for the "for" attribute in labels
[01:11:45] <plustour> hey, anyone who can help me with a simple image resize?
[01:11:48] <plustour> http://pastebin.com/3gsBxUNq
[01:12:12] <Testare> hello
[01:12:33] <plustour> i dont want to use some big plugins for this... all i need is... if the image width and height are bigger than the screen... to make a little resize
[01:14:07] <plustour> anyone?
[01:18:12] <zhulikas> plustour, firstly you use .gallery
[01:18:14] <zhulikas> then #gallery
[01:18:20] <zhulikas> you should use only class
[01:18:52] <zhulikas> I bet #gallery element doesn't exist in document
[01:18:56] <zhulikas> that's why it doesn't work
[01:19:01] <zhulikas> so, firstly fix that
[01:21:41] <plustour> zhulikas, i have <div id="gallery"></div> which has display: none; in my css
[01:21:48] <zhulikas> ohh
[01:21:55] <plustour> this is  the container for my image
[01:22:06] <plustour> and it exists, but it is not visible
[01:22:25] <zhulikas> sorry then
[01:22:31] <zhulikas> I didn't look at it carefully enough
[01:22:33] <plustour> the problem is... for example when the screen is small (1024x600 - netbook)
[01:22:58] <plustour> and the uploaded image is bigger than the size of the screen
[01:22:59] <Cork> plustour: try making a working example in jsfiddle see ?p
[01:22:59] <bot-t> plustour, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:23:30] <plustour> okay, but as i said... it depends on the user's screen
[01:29:41] <plustour> here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/
[01:32:11] <Cork> plustour: ok, so you need to add a check if the math result in negative values
[01:32:18] <Cork> and if so handle that
[01:32:57] <plustour> Cork, yes... something like that
[01:33:54] <Cork> plustour: like ex. resize the image so it fits the viewport
[01:33:58] <plustour> Cork, i think i have to check (window).width compared with $('#gallery').outherWidth
[01:34:16] <Cork> isn't window including the browser chrome?
[01:34:27] <zhulikas> why dont you check $('#gallery').outerWidth() instead?
[01:34:33] <zhulikas> what if you put gallery in another container?
[01:34:34] <zhulikas> :)
[01:34:41] <zhulikas> it would stop working if you relied on window
[01:35:07] <Cork> zhulikas: is absolutly positioned
[01:35:13] <Cork> its meant to fill the viewport
[01:35:19] <plustour> #gallery is right after the <body> tag
[01:35:36] <zhulikas> I am talking about forward compatibility, not the actual problem :)
[01:35:45] <Cork> but ya offset parent could be a better choice
[01:35:47] <plustour> anyway... it works but only for images, smaller than the browser windos
[01:36:03] <plustour> browser window* i mean
[01:36:43] <plustour> there is anoter problem.... i am showing the hidden div as soon as i add the html in it... and sometimes it is not centered in the middle
[01:37:34] <plustour> small googling shows that... sometimes (with bigger images) jquery can not get the outerWidth / Height, because the image is not yet loaded
[01:38:24] <Cork> plustour: not jquery
[01:38:27] <Cork> but the browser
[01:38:42] <Cork> and yes, you need to wait for the image to trigger the onload event on the img tag
[01:38:58] <plustour> well, Cork... i am a php guy :) so in js i am a noob :)
[01:39:23] <plustour> any ideas how to fix this piece of js? :(
[01:39:47] <Cork> plustour: var img = $('<img/>'); img.load(function() { alert('LOADED!'); }); img.src = url;
[01:40:05] <Cork> thats how you should create the img tag
[01:40:49] <plustour> Cork, huh... and what should i place there instead of alert();
[01:41:09] <Cork> everything that should happen when you want to show the image
[01:41:10] <plustour> Cork, maybe i have to check if ($(window).width() < $('#gallery').outerWidth()))
[01:41:27] <Cork> so more or less everything
[01:41:54] <Cork> else you end up in a race condition
[01:42:17] <plustour> Cork, can you give me a small code example? :/
[01:42:22] <Cork> just did
[01:42:43] <plustour> Cork, thanks... will try to... do it
[01:42:58] <plustour> and this is about the image load... what about the resizing?
[01:43:35] <Cork> set width: 100%; height: 100% on the image if its bigger then the viewport
[01:47:37] <plustour> Cork, please see this: http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/1/
[01:47:50] <plustour> is this enough to stop the race with the loading?
[01:49:19] <Cork> plustour: you almost didn't use any of the code i posted :/
[01:49:22] <Cork> no that won't work
[01:49:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/2/
[01:53:04] <plustour> Cork, call me a noob, but... why you're adding the src after the calculation of the #gallery position?
[01:53:18] <Cork> its not after
[01:53:24] <Cork> its after the load event listener
[01:53:33] <Cork> the callback is async
[01:53:47] <plustour> Cork, I need to place the container div (#gallery) in the middle of the screen and... it depends on the image size inside
[01:54:01] <plustour> Cork, i will try it now
[02:07:49] <plustour> Cork, with this code... the image is loading in the same window... but it just opens the link
[02:08:01] <plustour> Cork, no gallery, no placing the image inside
[02:13:40] <plustour> Cork, img.load is not a function
[02:16:31] <Cork> plustour: are yiou creating the img variable like i did in the fiddle?
[02:16:47] <plustour> yes, exactly the same code :/
[02:17:22] <Cork> hmm might be they've removed the shorthand
[02:17:42] <plustour> Cork, using jquery 1,8,2
[02:17:49] <plustour> 1.8.2 i mean
[02:18:00] <Cork> wait a min no
[02:18:09] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/2/ works fine here
[02:18:15] <Cork> so not sure what you're using
[02:19:51] <Kingsy> anyone know of a decent lightbox that does youtube videos?
[02:22:12] <plustour> Cork, using 1.8.2 and exactly the same piece of code... this is the error from firebug
[02:22:54] <Cork> plustour: you're getting the error on http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/2/ ?
[02:23:56] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, I'm trying to check for when the button element is loaded (orange one) but it's part of an iframe, how can I do this? http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/purchase/canvases/60-x-13-inch-canvas-print.html I tried document.observe(dom:loaded) but it triggers this before the iframe loads so it returns null
[02:25:21] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i see no iframe here
[02:26:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  It's awkward, the extension I'm using renders the orange button in some sort of frame, if you do document ready console log it logs before the button loads
[02:26:34] <fRAiLtY-> I need to capture the orange button to bind an event to it
[02:28:24] <plustour> Cork, works now :) cache problems
[02:28:34] <plustour> http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/3/
[02:28:45] <plustour> Cork, this is the code with a small picture
[02:29:04] <plustour> Cork, works great... now i have to deal with the bigger images
[02:30:15] <plustour> Cork, should I make those checks inside of the img.load function?
[02:30:33] <Cork> yes
[02:30:50] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Any suggestions?
[02:31:13] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: sorry don't have time to dig into the plugin replacing the upload element
[02:32:56] <fRAiLtY-> Ok
[02:35:32] <ItsJustMe> I don't want to use a plugin, I want to understand how pagination is created .. Where to look for? Which terms to google for?
[02:37:52] <Jungle_Jim> plustour, you have id and a class with the same name - gallery
[02:38:18] <plustour> Jungle_Jim, yes i know that... but this is not a problem (i think)
[02:39:27] <Cork> nope, not as long as theres only one element with that id
[02:49:18] <Trisox> Cork: any ideas for alternatives to settimeout or setinterval
[02:49:27] <Trisox> i got a slider with a timer..
[02:49:38] <Cork> for some form of animation you mean?
[02:49:43] <plustour> Cork, can not make this resize to work :/
[02:49:48] <Trisox> slide of images
[02:49:53] <Trisox> now i use setInterval
[02:49:56] <Cork> ?.animate
[02:50:11] <Cork> -_-
[02:50:14] <Trisox> dont think i can use animate..
[02:50:23] <Cork> why not?
[02:50:32] <Cork> (it uses setInterval though)
[02:50:48] <Trisox> right
[02:51:03] <Trisox> makes sense :D
[02:51:07] <Cork> only other option that exist is requestAnimationFrame
[02:51:18] <Cork> but you would have to have a fallback to setTimeout
[02:51:26] <Cork> cause not all browsers support it
[02:51:52] <Trisox> ill use setInterfall
[02:52:02] <Trisox> setTimeout is not exact
[02:52:13] <Cork> setTimeout is more exact then setInterval
[02:52:18] <Cork> so no that's not correct
[02:52:36] <Trisox> no other way around
[02:52:59] <Trisox> setInterval executes every 100ms for example
[02:53:04] <plustour> Cork, can you take a look here: http://jsfiddle.net/yD5rZ/5/
[02:53:05] <Trisox> setTimeout waits 100ms
[02:53:13] <Trisox> then it sets another timeout
[02:53:26] <Trisox> so it might be 101ms
[02:53:43] <plustour> Cork, i am testing with a bigger height now... and it adds the style to the image, but anyway it stays big :/.
[02:56:53] <plustour> Cork, the image tag has style="height: 50%" but there is no result in the browser
[03:18:56] <NielsNL> what is a good ui-theme icon for restore zoom?
[03:26:40] <koopajah> Hey everyone! In jQuery's sortable(). If I link multiple list together based on their class with the connectWith attribute, will it include list created dynamically afterwards? Meaning is the list of items computed at creation or during the drag ?
[03:30:16] <Alpha64> i'm getting crazy over this, how can i activate an element from an accordion in jqueryui if i know the id of the div i want to activate? i tried $("#theid").activate(); then the documentation talks about activating an especific  element with the index of it
[03:47:41] <geiregjo> Alpha64
[03:47:50] <geiregjo> Can't you just trigger the click event?
[03:49:04] <Alpha64> that would involve thinking from my part and i don't even remember the shape of my bed :P
[03:49:06] <Alpha64> i'll try it
[03:49:39] <geiregjo> $("#theid").click();
[03:49:49] <geiregjo> $("#theid").trigger('click');
[03:49:53] <geiregjo> Not sure, just try it :)
[03:50:18] <relixx> hey guys, I have a horizontal series of floated' div's, and I'm "sliding" away one by animate()ing his width to 0
[03:50:23] <jax> is it possible to smoothly scroll to the bottom of a page when somebody enters the page?
[03:50:59] <relixx> however, this is a very jerky animation (i.e. it apparently does it in 2 frames, very jumpy). I'm on a very performant machine so this shouldn't be an issue especially on this machine
[03:51:14] <Alpha64> that seems like a bad popupnder jax
[03:51:33] <relixx> any hints as to how I can discover the cause of this issue? fading the div away is *very* smoothly
[03:52:00] <jax> Alpha64: it just a calendar and the last day is all the way at the bottom
[03:52:10] <jax> i want the people to see the other days when it scrolls down
[03:52:22] <jax> i can just use an anchor
[03:52:24] <Alpha64> what about flipping all the elements?
[03:52:30] <jax> well it's a story..
[03:52:49] <jax> i could i guess.. but then they would read the story backwards
[03:53:07] <jax> but yeah i guess i could flip it
[03:53:47] <Alpha64> it's just that controllling the browser with your page feels bad
[03:54:00] <MalMen> http://jsbin.com/epimel/5/
[03:54:16] <MalMen> can anyone take a look please ? thank you :)
[03:55:52] <relixx> oh I might have found the cause
[03:55:56] <relixx> the div's contain scaled down images
[03:56:06] <relixx> apparently that causes significantly choppy animations in safari: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8542451/why-are-my-jquery-animations-choppy-in-webkit-based-browsers
[03:56:33] <ItsJustMe> Just want to know if it is the right start .. I want to do my pagination this way: I create an array of shown results, a user types his specifications in, the array gets cleared, the results filtered and the array filled again ..
[03:56:39] <ItsJustMe> Should I do that another way?
[03:56:45] <ItsJustMe> Or may I try it that way ..
[03:56:47] <ItsJustMe> ?
[03:57:29] <MalMen>   $(this).closest('form').submit(); is that supost to work ?
[04:27:39] <klj613> hello - what should i use to sanitize html on the client (js) end?

[04:28:43] <tijmen> Hi!
[04:29:00] <tijmen> does someone know where I can find the none-minimized version of CoverScroll ? http://slobodan.99k.org/plugins/coverscroll.html
[04:32:21] <ItsJustMe> okay, I give up .. I need a pagination script that accept divs without changing any styles and that I can reload after every keyup event (result filtering) .. therefore it also needs to only paginate visible divs .. Anyone who can help me with that?
[04:33:42] <csmrfx> Anybody else get errors on Opera wth any site that has minified jquery?
[04:38:31] <Jungle_Jim> Hi I'm trying to removed classes and add classes depending if clicked but it works for a while then starts doing weird things. http://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/C9Zbm/
[04:40:09] <Jungle_Jim> I'd also like the Main menu items class to be updated depending on the user click. Any ideas on how to do that?
[04:42:32] <NielsNL> are you sure the slidedown and up is not breaking it ?
[04:43:39] <AdamPDotty> and have you heard of CSS?
[04:44:43] <Mubin> hi guys
[04:44:46] <Mubin> hoe your all well
[04:44:52] <Mubin> quick question:\
[04:45:11] <Mubin> anyone know how to do multiple json requests?
[04:45:27] <Mubin> so retrieving multiple json files with one call?
[04:45:51] <Jungle_Jim> I found a tut on doing some of this with CSS .... but what I really want to do is highlight the selected menu items and also keep the "sub-Menu" displaying ... until a different menu item is selected
[04:46:21] <maasha> So ... There is no way to load a local JSON file (security issue) and no simple way to load a JSON file hosted on a http site if you use Chrome. There are issues with Access-Control-Allow-Origin or MIME type text/plain. What now?
[04:47:23] <NielsNL> maasha: i saw something about local storage (something new)
[04:48:33] <maasha> NielsNL: hm, I will have to look that up - but I am actually looking for something stable and generic - if it is at all possible.
[04:49:30] * maasha wonders if local storage is something HTML5
[04:49:34] <NielsNL> and how about local cookies? not sure how that will helpo you
[04:49:46] <NielsNL> yep both of them
[04:51:09] <Jungle_Jim> NielsNL, How do I stop the slidedown and up from interfering with the click event
[04:53:20] <Mubin> hey maasa
[04:53:27] <Mubin> I've ran int the same problem
[04:53:33] <Mubin> into*
[04:53:56] <Mubin> my backend guy is joining all the json objects into one and hosting on the same server
[04:54:04] <Mubin> that way i can access it
[04:54:27] <Mubin> and no problems
[04:57:38] <NielsNL> Jungle_Jim, sorry i have no clue
[05:24:07] <iSeeDeadPixels> hey guys
[05:28:31] <tankblergh> hey!
[05:29:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> does anyone know how i could animate multiple divs spinning slowly around one point?
[05:29:11] <tankblergh> I was wondering, is it possible to options in a select with borders?
[05:29:25] <tankblergh> style them*
[05:30:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> style options? with jquery, possibly, with css, nope.
[05:30:46] <tankblergh> I see, how would you proceed?
[05:35:27] <iSeeDeadPixels> does anyone know how i could animate multiple divs spinning slowly around one point?
[05:43:48] <Cork-> iSeeDeadPixels: would have to be through the step callback and calculating the radius
[05:45:41] <koopajah> Hey everyone : in jQuery sortable()  is it normal that the callback start is called more than once ?
[05:47:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork-: i just found a "path" plugin :)
[05:51:41] <noregret> when i print an array, it prints commas with thte items, how can i get rid of commas ?
[05:54:27] <juboba> I have a function that makes an ajax request every 5 minutes. If the session has expired, the response will be redirected (status code 302). In that case I would like to stop making the request. I tried using statusCode: {302: alert('asd');}} but I get nothing... any ideas?
[05:59:05] <alexlatttt> $('.product-list').find('li.active > a') <-- how do i get the next LI element following that?
[06:00:33] <shurikas> you could instead do $('.product-list li')
[06:00:35] <shurikas> then iterate over it
[06:02:36] <alexlatttt> after playing around for awhile $('.product-list li.active').next().children() is actually what i needed! :D
[06:03:03] <juboba> I have a function that makes an ajax request every 5 minutes. If the session has expired, the response will be redirected (status code 302). In that case I would like to stop making the request. I tried using statusCode: {302: alert('asd');}} but I get nothing... any ideas?
[06:05:58] <faraway> juboba: jquery would not get the 302 response but will get the content of the site that was redirected to
[06:06:44] <juboba> faraway, how can I know that I'vre been redirected?
[06:07:30] <faraway> juboba: so one solution would be to redirect to a page with 401 response where you return e.g. a {status:"403"} or something like that
[06:09:02] <juboba> uhm I'm redirecting to a login screen :(
[06:09:38] <juboba> all my controllers (including the ajax controller) check if the session is active and in case it's not they redirect to the login screen
[06:09:50] <juboba> I could make the exception for the ajax controller
[06:09:59] <juboba> uhm good idea
[06:10:22] <faraway> juboba: well why don't you check server side if it is an ajax request and then ruturn json instead of html
[06:10:48] <juboba> faraway, how can I know if it is an ajax request?
[06:12:04] <juboba> faraway, maybe I should use php's  $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']
[06:12:27] <koopajah> Can someone help me with a bug I have on Firefox with jQuery sortable() please? Seems like when I move the same element twice, the first time its position while dragging is correct, the second time it completely moves on the left
[06:13:58] <faraway> juboba: either you prefix all you ajax requests with .json or you relay on the Accept header of the request which should be either application/json or text/javascript
[06:14:17] <faraway> juboba: i went to using .json prefix just to be sure the it will work always
[06:14:33] <juboba> thanks faraway
[06:14:42] <faraway> juboba: np
[06:30:28] <halcyon1234> jqm: If I want to put custom css on a jqm page, where should it go? I can't put it in the Head <style>, since that only loads on 1st page. I can't put it in body, since <style> in body isn't right css. I'm worried if its in global.css (every page), I'll get naming conflicts across pages.
[06:44:13] <abn0rm_> hi guys, im new to js and jquery. im trying to do a post when a button is pushed, like this: mousedown(function(){$.post("url", { type="number" name="zero" } );} .. but i dosent work
[06:45:31] <NielsNL> what kind of issue do you have?
[06:46:05] <seutje> abn0rm_: bind to the submit event of the form, not the mousedown of the button
[06:46:14] <seutje> also, call preventDefault on the first argument passed into the event handler (the event)
[06:46:27] <NielsNL> not sure of you are already using it: but install firefox and the firebug plugin you can then monitor what the issues are.
[06:47:16] <abn0rm_> seutje: thank you!
[06:51:18] <NielsNL> seutje: thanks, you have helped me as well,
[06:51:50] <NielsNL> can we also do a this.preventDefault()?
[06:55:25] <dobalina> how can i check if the contents of a <select> element contains options or not... ?
[06:55:58] <halcyon1234> dobalina: $("select option").length > 0
[06:57:46] <seutje> NielsNL: sure, if this is an event object, which is actually rather doubtfull
[07:00:49] <NielsNL> seutje: nop it was not so i included on everywhere an event parameter and called     preventDefault();
[07:02:08] <NielsNL> what is better and why $('.select').click(...); or $('.select').bind('click', ....);
[07:02:38] <NielsNL> i use the first but i'm seeing the last option more and more
[07:06:43] <seutje> NielsNL: I prefer the last so it's less of a magic method
[07:06:57] <MalMen>   $(this).closest('form').submit(); is that possible ? can anybody take a look here please -> http://jsbin.com/epimel/5/edit
[07:07:10] <seutje> with the shorthand methods, it does something different depending on what arguments u pass
[07:07:27] <seutje> NielsNL: load is a perfect example
[07:07:37] <dobalina> halcyon1234 thx it sort of works but hmm
[07:07:48] <seutje> is it an event handler method, is it a trigger method, is it an AJAX shorthand?
[07:08:07] <seutje> NielsNL: also, see ?on
[07:08:08] <bot-t> NielsNL, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:08:09] <dobalina> any idea why this would always ignore the first condition on myreseller_id_supplier option http://pastebin.com/xWH78MxC
[07:08:48] <dobalina> i'm trying to make sure the alert popup is initiated when myreseller_id_supplier (which is an select element drop down menu is empty ie. contains no options)
[07:13:03] <fmertz> ot: is #jquerymobile by invitation, now?
[07:17:38] <jabo-> in tumblr
[07:17:42] <jabo-> how can i make infinite scroll stop
[07:17:46] <jabo-> after a certain page
[07:26:59] <boulet102010_> jabo-: infinite isn't finite, so you can't stop.
[07:27:17] <boulet102010_> you should put a limit
[07:29:32] <scalability-junk> sorry if crossposting jquery ui issues to the jquery channel is bad. but there are only 8 users in the ui channel and perhaps someone on here can help:
[07:29:41] <scalability-junk> hey I'm trying my luck with jquery ui and the autocomplete widget and I have some issues figuring some things out.
[07:29:41] <scalability-junk> When using the autocomplete there is the ui-helper-hidden-accessible class which is created right next to the textinput, is there any good way to overwrite where and how it is created instead of making a fork of the autocomplete.js?
[07:31:03] <NielsNL> seutje: thanks, so i should use the .on()
[07:36:02] <Pnoexz> hey, is there a way to emulate the file chooser (the one for <input type="field">) with jquery, instead of using the browsers'?
[07:40:07] <seutje> Pnoexz: sure, with 3rd party plugins, don't think you can do it in a proper and sane way
[07:40:54] <Pnoexz> seutje: do you remember any plugin? i didnt know this was such a pain
[07:41:11] <seutje> Pnoexz: I meant 3rd party plugin as in flash or java applet
[07:41:31] <Pnoexz> ah, that blows.. thanks seutje
[07:57:37] <Draeli> hi
[08:02:42] <brettster> YALL
[08:03:16] <brettster> i have a class .background being assigned to all LI's in an ul.
[08:03:34] <brettster> i want my jquery to randomly assign a background position to each li - how can i do this.
[08:03:47] <brettster> it's about 40 li's - but i don't want the amount of li's to be a factor in this
[08:05:17] <brettster> ANYONE?@!?!?
[08:05:28] <ajpiano> brettster: yeah
[08:05:31] <ajpiano> gimme a sec, making a demo
[08:05:39] <brettster> THANKS man!
[08:07:06] <mib_mib> hi guys, i have a 'queue' object, that i would like to queue up 2 requests right as the page loads, and fire them one after another, and then once document.ready() fires I want to push 2 more things to the queue - however, how do i make it so only one request fires at a time in serial fashion?
[08:09:38] <seutje> brettster: each over them and set their background position to whatever see ?each
[08:09:39] <bot-t> brettster, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:10:28] <brettster> seutje - i don't want to have to make 40 different classes - i'd rathe jQuery randomize they're background position
[08:12:32] <brettster> how's it going ajpiano
[08:13:24] <warden23> G'day, could someone please tell me if it is possible by jquery to do the following: I want to hide 1 div if a certain class is present in another div?
[08:13:26] <ajpiano> almost done
[08:14:20] <warden23> Yes I have googled, but can't find a an answer to my question, so I came here in great need of help lol
[08:14:29] <warden23> find an*
[08:15:02] <ajpiano> brettster: http://jsbin.com/enigug/2/edit
[08:18:01] <ajpiano> kind of a neat effect actually lol
[08:19:09] <brettster> hm can't get it working
[08:20:01] <ajpiano> ok
[08:20:32] <brettster> ahh
[08:20:37] <brettster> my Li's already exist
[08:20:43] <brettster> i don't want the script to create the li's
[08:20:47] <brettster> just the background position
[08:20:51] <ajpiano> it's a freaking demo of the technique
[08:21:07] <ajpiano> i didn't feel like writing 40 lis into the html
[08:21:15] <ajpiano> you should be able to adapt it from there, i'd tend to think
[08:21:27] <brettster> do i just remove the join function?
[08:21:52] <ajpiano> yes, you'd replace it with a selection of your lis
[08:21:56] <ajpiano> $("#mylist li")
[08:22:46] <burg> hello. in jqueryui tabs, if a tab points to /some/page (loaded with ajax), and that /some/page has pagination (pointing to /some/page/2 and so on), how can i make the tab content to change to the new page when the user clicks on pagination, but keep the tab title?
[08:23:27] <brettster> go it
[08:23:29] <brettster> thank you!
[08:23:54] <ajpiano> :)
[08:24:30] <jeremy-> I'm working with datatables and the inline editing example shown here: http://datatables.net/blog/Inline_editing every feature works for me except that the inline fields show undefined instead of inheriting the value. Any ideas?
[08:24:50] <jeremy-> I'm thinking it may be because the example is a static table and I am using json, and then something to do with looking up the row to get the value
[08:32:00] <Jungle_Jim_> Hi,  I'm trying to add and remove classes based on a users click but not having any luck. It seems the classes are added (via firebug) but it does not reflect in the browser http://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/kLP64/
[08:35:26] <Guest21584> you are not actually adding the .current to the li, but to the a
[08:35:51] <Guest21584> $(this).parent().addClass('current'); adds current to the li and you can see the color changing
[08:36:34] <warden23> Leukocyt for president!
[08:36:47] <Leukocyt> warden23: haha thanks ;)
[08:36:51] <jacobroufa> Jungle_Jim_: what Guest21584 said; or do #nav a.current in your css, instead of #nav .current a
[08:36:52] <jacobroufa> :)
[08:37:08] <Gho5t> Jungle_Jim_: http://jsfiddle.net/kLP64/11/
[08:37:08] <Guest21584> yes ^^
[08:37:52] <jacobroufa> grafi: wouldnt defining that in css be quicker than traversing and selecting .parent()?
[08:38:00] <grafi> probably
[08:38:58] <jacobroufa> also, with either method, will probably need some small additional logic for children menu items; as when those are selected (and assigned .current, accordingly) their parents dont show that
[08:40:15] <Jungle_Jim_> grafi, jacobroufa Thanks
[08:40:20] <grafi> np
[08:41:02] <jacobroufa> yw
[08:41:48] <Jungle_Jim_> grafi, jacobroufa Two more questions. I need to keep the dropped menu open if it is clicked and I need to set it's li and parent li to current
[08:42:18] <jammanbo> I wonder is anyone here familiar with jquery.waypoints? I'm trying to figure out how to 'remove' and then reenable some waypoints, but it aint working.
[08:48:33] <Jungle_Jim_> grafi, jacobroufa I spent two days getting this far -read more jquery tutorials than i can count - silly client insists on this - I sure its a pretty simple thing to do so any help or pointers appreciated
[08:53:31] <mib_mib> how do i create 'locks' on a jquery queue object to ensure that only one job executes at a time?
[08:55:03] <jacobroufa> Jungle_Jim_: find the parent UL of the dropdown and assign it a class that will display
[08:56:56] <jacobroufa> something like $( this ).parent().closest( 'ul' ).addClass( 'openparent' );
[08:57:18] <jacobroufa> and then define the display (block, whatever) in your css
[08:57:48] <jacobroufa> erm. dunno if youd need .parent() in there
[09:05:39] <sethetter> Jungle_Jim_: http://jsfiddle.net/kLP64/13/ Like this??
[09:07:34] <Jungle_Jim_> sethetter, yes .. almost
[09:07:39] <sethetter> Jungle_Jim_: http://jsfiddle.net/kLP64/14/
[09:07:49] <grafi> btw, the hover effect looks different on firefox than on chrome
[09:07:53] <jacobroufa> sethetter: good stuff. needs to remove class stayopen on init though :p
[09:08:00] <jacobroufa> otherwise multiple dropdowns coexist :)
[09:10:21] <sethetter> jacobroufa: right, that's a start though :)
[09:10:54] <jacobroufa> sethetter: yup yup :)
[09:12:00] <Jungle_Jim_> sethetter, perfect ... already tweaked it http://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/kLP64/15/ ... Thanks for the good start
[09:12:08] <sethetter> Jungle_Jim_: anytime
[09:13:08] <jacobroufa> Jungle_Jim_: have fun with the jquery learning :) this is the tip of the iceberg.
[09:13:44] <sethetter> i <3 jquery
[09:16:21] <Jungle_Jim_> It's harder to learn than a normal language (C, C++) I think  because of the number of outside variables (CSS and html)
[09:16:52] <Jungle_Jim_> been struggling with this for days now - so thanks again :-)
[09:16:59] <Caelum> does .siblings('li') give me all siblings that are <li> or all of those and any descendants of those siblings that are <li> as well?
[09:17:05] <bradmaxs> trying to change the class of the last li item in this each function but not sure what to use. http://jsfiddle.net/9MMtE/
[09:18:14] <jacobroufa> Caelum: console.log( $( this ).siblings( 'li' ) )
[09:18:34] <jacobroufa> Caelum: you should just be getting the former though (all siblings that are <li>)
[09:18:45] <sethetter> Jungle_Jim_: no problem. It's funny cause I've always viewed C, C++, etc as more difficult because I started wtih HTML, CSS and Javascript. Now that I'm learning C++ I'm seeing how much more control you have over every bit of your program. That's not the case in front-end :P
[09:19:36] <Jungle_Jim_> sethetter, Exactly
[09:20:29] <jojovem> hi all
[09:20:35] <Jungle_Jim_> sethetter, But why u learning C++ ... ouch .... I would rather learn python ;-)
[09:20:44] <sethetter> bradmaxs: Cache the length of the array you are 'each'ing over and then test for if the index of current item matches length-1
[09:20:47] <jojovem> im having a simple problem trying to make a simple jquery plugin
[09:21:09] <jojovem> when i bind the lugin like this:			$(this).ToolTipCartao({ 				Id : Bandeira 			});
[09:21:15] <sethetter> Jungle_Jim_: I'm a web dev teacher and they needed someone to teach the intro to C++ class, lol
[09:21:22] <jojovem> i pass an id to override its default parameter
[09:21:26] <jojovem> BUT
[09:21:37] <bradmaxs> sethetter: thanks - I'll give it a try
[09:21:40] <jojovem> if i want to bind the plugin again but with a different arameter?
[09:21:44] <jojovem> how do i do that?
[09:21:45] <sethetter> bradmaxs: np, let me know if it works
[09:22:05] <jojovem> because if i bind the plugin again, it holds the first Id value
[09:22:05] <bradmaxs> sethetter: will do
[09:22:22] <sethetter> jojovem: you want to bind it to a new element on the page?
[09:22:28] <jojovem> no to the same
[09:22:32] <jojovem> i only want to change the parameter
[09:22:52] <jojovem> do i have to do $('element').prototype.Id ?
[09:23:05] <jojovem> = something else?
[09:23:45] <sethetter> jojovem: I'm not sure I follow completely without knowing what the plugin is doing
[09:23:56] <jojovem> it doesnt nothing yet
[09:24:01] <jojovem> it just console logs the Id
[09:24:07] <jojovem> when i bind it once
[09:24:15] <jojovem> i get a value of 2(the first value im passing)
[09:24:29] <sethetter> can you make a fiddle so I can see the code
[09:24:32] <jojovem> but if do it again with a different Id
[09:24:34] <jojovem> it sill prints 2
[09:24:41] <Caelum> jacobroufa: yup, thank you, that's a neat trick as well (can click to open the elements in the console, very cool)
[09:24:58] <jojovem> i have this inside my main plugin function
[09:24:59] <jojovem> 		$(this.element).focus(function(){ 			console.log(Id); 		});
[09:25:17] <jacobroufa> Caelum: yw. when in doubt, console.log() :)
[09:26:05] <jojovem> this is the line: 			$(this).ToolTipCartao({ 				Id : 2 });
[09:26:35] <jojovem> i get a console log of 2
[09:26:37] <jojovem> but
[09:26:39] <warden23> Hello, how do I edit my current script to make it if the classes hide-cats cf_clear appear as seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/fyvYc/2/ then the div container-cats will display? but pages that don't have cf_clear after the hide-cats hides the div container-cats? does that make sense
[09:26:39] <jojovem> if i do this
[09:26:44] <jojovem> this is the line: 			$(this).ToolTipCartao({ 				Id : 3 });
[09:26:51] <jojovem> it still prints 2 not 3
[09:27:11] <sethetter> jojovem: hmm, seems like it's referencing the first instance instead of your new one
[09:27:15] <jojovem> its like the plugin is binding the first value and it is not changing after a second bind(tha ti think it would override)
[09:27:23] <warden23> at the moment it does it job and hides the div, but i have a page that adds the cf_clear to it and I want it that on that page it shows the div?
[09:27:28] <warden23> any help will be much love
[09:27:32] <warden23> :D
[09:27:32] <jojovem> what should i do?
[09:27:37] <Caelum> I want to do .siblings('li > a') except that doesn't work
[09:27:51] <sethetter> jojovem: does the plugin return new instances of the object attached to the element it's bound to?
[09:28:04] <jojovem> no, i forbid that
[09:28:15] <jojovem> with this
[09:28:16] <jojovem>     $.fn[pluginName] = function ( options ) {         return this.each(function () {             if (!$.data(this, 'plugin_' + pluginName)) {                 $.data(this, 'plugin_' + pluginName, new Plugin( this, options ));             }         });     }
[09:28:36] <jojovem> i learned to put it to a queue so it doesn´t make new instances
[09:28:44] <jojovem> i want to change the first instance
[09:28:48] <jojovem> but i dont know how
[09:29:18] <jojovem> ill rephrase my question: How do i change a parameter of a already instatiated plugin object
[09:30:08] <lcMatt> Could someone check over this snippet and see what I'm doing wrong http://pastebin.com/3pP6QSwX - cheers
[09:30:45] <sethetter> jojovem: hmm, well you would need to access the object that's been instantiated somehow, not call the constructor again. apparently the constructor isn't able to override the existing instance
[09:30:57] <sethetter> afk
[09:31:06] <jojovem> i see!
[09:31:09] <jojovem> ty
[09:32:58] <Caelum> how do I get the immediately following <a> rather than all following <a>s from a wrapped set
[09:35:06] <Caelum> oh it's just .find('> a')
[09:35:10] <Caelum> awesome
[09:43:08] <Jungle_Jim_> sethetter, Got everything working like I wanted http://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/kLP64/   Is it coded it in an "approved" way?
[09:43:52] <bavanyo> Hey all! Is there anyone from the LA Meetup online?
[09:45:05] <bradmaxs> sethetter: while I was trying to find how to cache the .length I found this solution. Thanks for setting me on the right path. http://jsfiddle.net/9MMtE/1/
[09:54:07] <Asterokid> hi
[09:57:54] <chasep_notworkin> Is there an easy way to "toggle" a checkbox? I don't want to have to check it's state so I can determine the next state, i just want it to go to the next state regardless of its current state
[09:59:04] <koopajah> chasep_notworkin > $("#my_checkbox).attr('checked', !$("#my_checkbox).attr('checked'))
[10:00:23] <chasep_notworkin> koopajah: thats still doing a state check... found a really easy way, since I don't have any listeners on it anyway, $('#my_checkbox').click()
[10:05:41] <Caelum> chasep_notworkin: .click() is the best way, it will also fire any events associated with a click, I use .click() for everything :)
[10:06:46] <NoiseEee> chasep_notworkin: isn't that how checkboxes work without javascript?
[10:07:00] <NoiseEee> chasep_notworkin: or are you asking how to toggle a checkbox?
[10:08:22] <chasep_notworkin> NoiseEee: toggling it... and, the curve ball is that I'm dealing with a checkbox converted to a jquery-ui button. calling "click" on the label would properly toggle the classes, but not the checkbox
[10:09:36] <chasep_notworkin> so, now I have if(shouldBeChecked != label.is('ui-state-active') { label.toggleClass('ui-state-active ui-state-default');}  if(shouldBeChecked != cb.is(':checked')){ cb.click();}
[10:11:53] <docmur> I'm trying to print information for a text area and then append information under that first line, I thought this should work but it doesn't: http://pastebin.com/SUVctDB8
[10:17:38] <bigmac99> I am working on an html form, and using jquery for a date field.  I have multiple date fields on this form.  I can use this ---> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker(); for the first field, but not any of the others.  I'm sure I'm doing something wrong,  can anyone help? Thanks in advance.

[10:19:28] <JessC> @bigmac99 Yes, if you use an id tag then it will only match one
[10:20:19] <bigmac99> ok...   this is what I have in my body          <input name="date1" type="text" id="datepicker" size="10" maxlength="10" />
[10:20:31] <firstclassfunc> I have several elements with class XYZ. What's the best way to find elements with class XYZ and data-wsid=$x, where I want to search for $x
[10:21:05] <koopajah> firstclassfunc > data-wsid is an attribute?
[10:21:18] <bigmac99> so would I have to create multiples of this,  $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker(); ,   something like this?   $( "#datepicker2" ).datepicker();  ,   $( "#datepicker3" ).datepicker();
[10:21:27] <NoiseEee> firstclassfunc: $('.xyz[data-wsid="'+x+'"]')
[10:22:00] <JessC> @bigmac99 If you want to select multiple ones #ids are the most efficient if you don't want to have to list multiple you can create a sudo class and bind to that
[10:22:00] <b-ot> JessC, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[10:22:51] <bigmac99> @JessC,  can you explain?  I'm not a coder,  but I've been pushed into creating this form at work.  I don't understand what you said.
[10:23:55] <bigmac99> @JessC,  thanks for your time, btw.
[10:24:39] <JessC> @bigmac99 option a: $('#id1, #id2, #id3').datepicker(); - Then all of your inputs have to have those associated ids. Option b: $('.date-picker').datepicker(); - Then any field input that you add the class ".date-picker" to will have that plugin bound to it
[10:24:39] <b-ot> JessC, definitely being used as one ;)
[10:25:38] <bigmac99> @JessC,  this form is an order form that has 27 date boxes on it....  is there a cleaner way to do it?
[10:25:51] <firstclassfunc> koopajah: yes sir
[10:26:05] <firstclassfunc> NoiseEee: thanks.. I don't know why that didn't occur to me
[10:26:19] <JessC> @bigmac99 option b as I explained would be better. in that case
[10:27:44] <bigmac99> @JessC,   this is my code for my first date box, and it works -->   <input name="date1" type="text" id="datepicker" size="10" maxlength="10" />,  if I make another box, that reads -->   <input name="date2" type="text" id="datepicker" size="10" maxlength="10" />,  the datepicker calendar does not show up when I click in the field.
[10:29:45] <JessC> @bigmac99 <input name="date1" type="text" class="date-picker" size="10" maxlength="10" />
[10:30:08] <JessC> you should use a name that you are sure isn't being used by anything else
[10:30:26] <bigmac99> @JessC ok let me try that
[10:30:26] <b-ot> bigmac99, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[10:30:49] <bigmac99> @b-ot  ???  not sure what you are asking
[10:30:50] <b-ot> bigmac99, no YOU ARE asking
[10:31:04] <bigmac99> ?
[10:32:28] <bigmac99> @JessC do I have to do something at the top to define that class or something?
[10:32:41] <bigmac99> in the <script> section?
[10:32:44] <JessC> no
[10:32:45] <bigmac99> or function?
[10:33:04] <JessC> its a css style reference but it doesn't have to actually reference anything in the stylesheet
[10:33:18] <JessC> when your browser hits that spot and doesnt see a match in the css it ignores it
[10:33:31] <JessC> but jquery will pick it up and apply that function to that input
[10:34:04] <JessC> this method is easier to do as you can create 1 instance so all of the settings are the same and you don't have to manage 27 different ids
[10:37:07] <bigmac99> @JessC  I changed my code to include the class="date-picker" like this ---> <input name="date2" type="text" class="date-picker" size="10" maxlength="10" />  but it does not do anything when I click in the box.
[10:37:32] <bigmac99> @JessC should I also have the id= part in the code?
[10:39:34] <bigmac99> date1 box works but date2 box does not --->  <input name="date1" type="text" id="datepicker" size="10" maxlength="10" />    <input name="date2" type="text" class="date-picker" size="10" maxlength="10" />
[10:40:48] <bigmac99> and I'm using the code like the demo source found here:   http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#default
[10:43:39] <JessC> @bigmac99 what does the jquery code look like?

[10:48:25] <messer> Could anyone help me in finding information how to access public method inside a Jquery plugin build on jqueryboilerplate (http://jqueryboilerplate.com/). I've been using google, however cannot find anything directly useful
[10:49:39] <ryanneufeld> messer: what is unlear?
[10:51:12] <messer> ryanneufeld: good question - I've been trying calls like $('elem').pluginname('method','attr') and many others, however nothing works
[10:51:52] <messer> structure seems to me to be clear, but nothing works
[10:52:17] <messer> In fact I try to modify ascensor.js - nice plugin\

[10:54:00] <ryanneufeld> messer: see ?demo
[10:54:01] <bot-t> messer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:54:22] <JessC> @bigmac99 http://jsfiddle.net/5WrgR/
[10:56:08] <messer> ryanneufeld: I'll put on jsfiddle and show - will take a while
[10:56:24] <bigmac99> @JessC,  I think I have it now
[10:57:03] <ryanneufeld> messer: well there is a good chance you'll find your problem in the process. but keep it simple if you can
[10:57:16] <bigmac99> @JessC how do I share something with you on jsfiddle?
[10:57:34] <JessC> hit save and then on the right hand side there is a "share" button
[10:57:34] <bigmac99> do I have to create a login or something?
[10:57:41] <bigmac99> oh ok
[10:57:54] <messer> ryanneufeld: Trying, good thing is that now I know a lot more about JQuery plugins :)

[11:01:25] <bigmac99> @JessC   http://jsfiddle.net/qD49D/1/
[11:03:55] <bigmac99> @JessC   thank you for your help, I think I understand it now.   I appreciate your time.
[11:04:10] <maasha> ryanneufeld: so jQuery can in general not access files that are stored locally or remotely for security reasons. JSON data should be comming from a HTTP server.
[11:04:46] <JessC> @bigmac99 in your elements you have id="datepicker" you should have class="datepicker"
[11:05:27] <bigmac99> @JessC ,  yes, sorry I only changed the first 2 lines as a test,  they say class=
[11:05:28] * maasha reads some more
[11:05:58] <bigmac99> @JessC  but the 2 lines I changed do work,  so I can make changes to the rest of the form now.
[11:06:09] <JessC> yep
[11:06:36] <bigmac99> @JessC,  again, thanks for your time.  I appreciate it.  Have a happy thanksgiving
[11:06:45] <JessC> you too
[11:07:02] <bigmac99>  (if you celebrate thanksgiving, that is  =)  )

[11:08:32] <bigmac99> uh oh
[11:12:16] <Alisson> someone could help me with an ajax problem?
[11:12:36] <Snane> someone probably could
[11:12:44] <Alisson> tks
[11:13:26] <Alisson> anyone <<
[11:13:32] <JessC> what is the problem?
[11:14:32] <Alisson> i've a page that shows a list from my BD, the results are provided by a PHP page, requested by ajax (post methed)
[11:15:17] <Alisson> that list comes with a rating system, and if you arent logged in the site, when you click, you receive an alert asking you to login
[11:15:31] <JessC> ok
[11:16:13] <Alisson> the list contains paging, and every time you click a page, a new ajax request is sent.....
[11:16:53] <Alisson> the problem is when you change the page, and try to click the rating.....the alert is sent twice
[11:17:28] <JessC> you could set an internal flag so that once that message is sent it won't alert again
[11:17:39] <Alisson> and the alert is sent the same amount of times you change page
[11:18:06] <JessC> do you have some sort of session management?
[11:18:49] <JessC> have you tried setting a cookie?
[11:18:59] <JessC> that would be persistent across page changes
[11:19:06] <Alisson> yes......i use an if condition, if the the user is logged, I create the list with a class "disabled"
[11:19:21] <Alisson> when the disabled is clicked, I alert him
[11:19:38] <danmichel> I'm trying desperately to figure out why this is happening. hard to explain video: http://cl.ly/L4Re when you hover oner the navigation button, the whole page moves site: http://cl.ly/L4O4
[11:20:38] <Alisson> how would be this internal flag?
[11:21:55] <JessC> @Alisson set a cookie the first time you alert that warning
[11:22:13] <deadalus> how could i use jquery to redirect to a new page without using a href?
[11:22:14] <firstclassfunc> The following is an example template: <div id="{{id}}" {{attrs}}> stored inside a script element. When I retrieve the text with $('#scriptID').html(), it changes {{attrs}} to {{attrs}}=""
[11:22:21] <firstclassfunc> how can I force jQuery to NOT do that?
[11:22:51] <JessC> @deadalus is this a click event?
[11:22:58] <deadalus> JessC: yes
[11:24:30] <JessC> @deadalus http://jsfiddle.net/eDLBB/
[11:24:48] <Alisson> @JessC ok, I set a cookie with a few seconds of duration, containing the id of that item of the list......and if the cookie exists, doesnt sent an alert.....how can i block the alert???
[11:24:53] <firstclassfunc> someone please help, this is retarded
[11:25:38] <JessC> set it for longer than a few seconds and be sure to delete it if they login, if that cookie doesn't exist show the alert and when you show the alert set the cookie
[11:27:04] <Alisson> i got, if the client click the same item again, then the alert will not be sent
[11:27:08] <Alisson> thanks JessC ^^
[11:27:15] <JessC> yep np
[11:27:16] <deadalus> thanks, JessC
[11:29:51] <JessC> @firstclassfunc do you have a jsfiddle with this?
[11:31:26] <mib_mib> hi guys, i am compressing my javascript using closure-compiler. In my javascript, i have a line that sets a var to a string of css, i.e.     var someCss = '.someClass { background:blue} .someOtherClass{font-size:10px}' - however, closure compiler is hiccuping on this statement - how can i get this to pass?
[11:42:31] <dogmatic69> Anyone know what the correct change for this is? "input:checkbox[not:" + $(this).attr('id') + "]"
[11:42:42] <dogmatic69> I am pretty sure it was working before upgrading.
[11:45:40] <danzik17> dogmatic69: what does the id attribute contain?
[11:45:51] <dogmatic69> foobar
[11:46:07] <dogmatic69> I tried adding # too, got it working slightly differently.
[11:46:19] <danzik17> what are you trying to "not" - a checkbox input that is not a specific id?
[11:46:31] <dogmatic69> $('that selector without :not').not('#' . $the-id)
[11:47:07] <dogmatic69> danzik17: exactly, the id from $(this) is the checkbox for toggle all.
[11:48:24] <dogmatic69> danzik17: http://jsfiddle.net/P8w7K/
[11:56:11] <acidjazz> hey all.. so i got a <ul><li> with say 10 li's.. i want to add a class to only 5 of them... whats hte best practice for that?
[11:56:51] <danzik17> dogmatic69: very untested, but http://jsfiddle.net/P8w7K/2/
[11:56:52] <dblosevn> acidjazz: which 5 you trying to add a class too?
[11:57:51] <acidjazz> the 1st 5
[11:57:52] <dblosevn> first 5, every other one etc @acidjazz
[11:57:59] <dblosevn> too slow lol
[11:57:59] <acidjazz> sorry for not being clear about that
[11:58:11] <tinkster> Anyone here familiar w/ the jquery.validity plugin?
[12:00:27] <dblosevn> acidjazz: { var count = 1; $('ul li').each(function () { if (count == 5) {return } $(this).hasClass('newclass');  count++; } )}
[12:00:37] <acidjazz> ah a .each
[12:00:54] <acidjazz> yea thats what i have... i guess thats ideal eh?
[12:01:08] <dblosevn> not really ideal, easiest solution
[12:01:23] <dblosevn> could do it with just the selector
[12:02:02] <acidjazz> what like
[12:02:09] <acidjazz> $('ul li:first-five'). ?
[12:02:36] <dblosevn> acidjazz: $('ul li:nth-child(1), ul li:nth-child(2), ul li:nth-child(3), ul li:nth-child(4), ul li:nth-child(5)').addClass('newclass');
[12:02:50] <acidjazz> wtffff
[12:02:50] <acidjazz> $('table tr:gt(2):lt(2)');
[12:02:56] <acidjazz> wtf is this
[12:02:58] <acidjazz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1954342/getting-a-range-of-elements-in-one-jquery-selector
[12:03:20] <JessC> @acidjazz you could do $('ul li:lt(5)")
[12:03:32] <dblosevn> ya
[12:03:34] <JessC> that would match based on the index so 0-4
[12:03:46] <JessC> not sure of its efficiency though compared to each
[12:04:05] <dblosevn> $('ul li:lt(5)');
[12:04:11] <acidjazz> this is crazy
[12:04:21] <dblosevn> i skipped right over that one
[12:04:49] <dblosevn> JessC++
[12:05:06] <mixandgo> what happens if you do an $("#selector").on('click', ...) and the #selector doesn't exist ? does jQuery run the callback ?
[12:05:14] <JessC> no
[12:05:16] <acidjazz>       $('#new-main-invite-list li:gt(0):lt(' + total + ')').removeClass('ghost').addClass('filled');
[12:05:26] <dblosevn> no it doesnt attach the listener to anything @mixando
[12:05:27] <JessC> @mixandgo if jquery doesn't match anything it won't run
[12:05:30] <acidjazz> oh even bette dblosevn
[12:05:59] <dblosevn> ya you dont need lt if it is going to start from 0
[12:06:00] <mixandgo> JessC: so doing a check beforehand is useless since jQuery already does that, right ?
[12:06:17] <JessC> yes
[12:06:37] <mixandgo> ok thank you JessC, dblosevn
[12:06:50] <dblosevn> sorry, you dont need gt if it starts at 0
[12:06:55] <dblosevn> @acidjazz
[12:07:21] <dblosevn> gt is used if say you wanted to start from index 3 and get up to index 8
[12:07:47] <dblosevn> mixandgo: :-D
[12:12:03] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to add this code: if (jqElem.find('div.rotator ul li').hasClass('showslide')) { $('div.rotator ul li.showslide').css(display: block); } else { $('#slideshowid li').css(display: none); } to http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/20/ but this isn't making the slideshow work.  All I want to do is make the slides that don't have class showslide to be hidden.  Any ideas?
[12:15:01] <dblosevn> jqElem.find('div.rotator ul li:not(.showslide').hide(); jqElem.find('div.rotator ul li.showslide').show();
[12:15:54] <dblosevn> @shawnrisk
[12:16:01] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: let me try that
[12:16:42] <keirlav87> i've made a generic form handler, but i cant seem to pass it the form object properly - can anyone please take a look at this fiddle which shows what im trying to do and where its failing - http://jsfiddle.net/2895k/3/
[12:17:54] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: same result slides ontop of each other when loading, I am putting the code above below this line: jqElem.find('ul li:first').addClass('showslide').css({opacity: 1.0}); is that the right place?
[12:17:55] <dblosevn> keirlav87: $('form').on('submit','.callbackform',function(e){
[12:18:10] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: ill check it out
[12:18:33] <keirlav87> i dont think thats the issue though?
[12:18:42] <dblosevn> keirlav87: you are assigning a reference to document to the varible tis
[12:18:53] <keirlav87> fair play! i'll give that a try
[12:19:27] <dblosevn> as you bound the submit listener to document the context will be document
[12:21:02] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: im still looking at your code
[12:21:06] <keirlav87> it doesn't seem to be doing anything - thought the reference this would be to the selector that I specify after the event in the on declaration?
[12:21:07] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/2895k/7/
[12:21:58] <keirlav87> try my first fiddle - i have  a console log of what 'tis' actually is - and it is the form that I am passing to my handler
[12:22:26] <dblosevn> keirlav87: try that http://jsfiddle.net/u4pM4/
[12:23:02] <keirlav87> yeah I could bind to the form directly, but I need it to be declarative as the form is added to the dom after doc ready
[12:23:30] <dblosevn> bind it right after adding it to the dom
[12:23:40] <keirlav87> infact even that has the same issue
[12:23:46] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: thanks
[12:24:09] <keirlav87> note this console log - console.log($(tis).children('.bootstrap-datepicker').val());
[12:24:20] <keirlav87> is undefined even though the child input with that class name is present in the form
[12:26:14] <keirlav87> do you see what i mean?
[12:26:38] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/3Uhhx/
[12:27:16] <keirlav87> sorry! solved it myself - changed .children to .find
[12:27:23] <dblosevn> keirlav87: try $(tis).find('.bootstrap-datepicker');
[12:27:50] <dblosevn> most likely .bootstrap-datepicker is not a direct decendant of form
[12:28:06] <keirlav87> sorry, wasting your time I solved it by changing .children to .find
[12:30:51] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: still same problem, all you add in were the two lines in $(document).ready(function() { } function?
[12:31:06] <dblosevn> ya but reading the code that wont work
[12:31:37] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: pardon?
[12:33:41] <dblosevn> i guess im lost on what it supossed to do
[12:34:03] <dblosevn> i see its dynamically adding and removing showslide
[12:35:07] <andrew91841> what is the best way to remember positions on an appendTo call, and then moving them back after?
[12:35:33] <JessC> @andrew91841 can you elaborate?
[12:35:58] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: all I want to all is for a way to remove all the slides expect the one that active.
[12:36:21] <andrew91841> JessC: I want to go full screen with a couple elements, and then return back from full screen.  browser window full screen, not OS fullscreen
[12:36:30] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/3Uhhx/4/ look at the css
[12:36:59] <burg> hello. in jqueryui tabs, if a tab points to /some/page (loaded with ajax), and that /some/page has pagination (pointing to /some/page/2 and so on), how can i make the tab content to change to the new page when the user clicks on pagination, but keep the tab title?
[12:38:41] <JessC> @andrew91841 if you mean having a div fill up the entire screen you can do that with css. whatever your condition is have jquery apply a css style and then when it closes just remove that style
[12:39:01] <JessC> if you have a jsfiddle that'd help
[12:39:37] <andrew91841> that would be ideal, but that assumes all my elements are linearly nested, but that's not the case
[12:39:59] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: I hecked in the debugger only the active slide is visible
[12:40:09] <dblosevn> *checked
[12:40:13] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: looking
[12:40:21] <houman> hi, I would like to pass a variable ($parent) as parameter to a sub-function (row_delete_ajax()) -->  $(parent).find(".row_delete_ajax").click(row_delete_ajax(parent));  but I think thats wrong
[12:40:39] <houman> how do I pass it?
[12:42:12] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: I added this to the css div.rotator ul li {        display: none;    }    div.rotator ul li.showslide {        display:block;    }
[12:42:29] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: okay
[12:42:49] <darrennnn> hi #jquery, i am looking to add a class to something and then ... fade that class away. so lets say .error { background:red; } --  i want to click an element and add that class and then fade that class away.
[12:42:59] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: no reason to try to force js to do what css was designed for
[12:43:08] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: right
[12:43:38] <dblosevn> it honestly looks the same to me though
[12:43:48] <dblosevn> maybe it already did what you wanted in chrome lol
[12:45:41] <JessC> @houman jquery already sets this (the keyword) to that object so inside your function you would get the parent by $(this).parent();
[12:46:34] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: that works, but the other part is that when the first slide loads the text loads and than a few seconds later the image loads.  How do I make them both show up at the same time?
[12:47:35] <JessC> @darrennnn you probably want to use the animate function
[12:47:48] <acidjazz> i have some setTimeouts ive had to use.. when is it good to clearTimeout?
[12:47:54] <acidjazz> i guess before it tries to overlap?
[12:48:11] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: what browser chrome seems to fade them both at the same time?
[12:48:23] <anarchist_> anyone want to collaborate on this collaborative realtime taskmanager in meteor.js ? http://198.61.228.205:3000/
[12:48:44] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: I am using Safari but I am checking on my dev site too, and that is where the problem is.
[12:48:46] <JessC> @acidjazz setTimeouts fire once are you talking about setinterval?
[12:48:52] <anarchist_> right now it's set to show our jquery task(s)
[12:49:18] <acidjazz> JessC: no im talking about my code running again before the timeout finishes
[12:49:19] <dblosevn> checking
[12:49:24] <darrennnn> JessC: animate is too hardcoded, i was looking to do it using classes  then i can change it easy.
[12:49:31] <darrennnn> in a css file
[12:50:10] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: do you want me to link you to my dev site?
[12:50:42] <JessC> @acidjazz do you have an example of your code?
[12:51:26] <acidjazz> well its a click handler that fires some animatinos
[12:51:27] <anarchist_> right now it's running a command that shows all the code of the app. what i'd like it to do is that you click on the command in the sidebar and then it autopopulates the command input line
[12:51:40] <anarchist_> so i guess it's a "click handler" that autopopulates a field
[12:51:42] <acidjazz> and JessC im worried if someone slams on the button firing it over and over ill have issue?
[12:51:44] <acidjazz> issues*
[12:51:55] <JessC> @acidjazz so you're saying you have function a and function b, you have function a run and want to wait for it to finish before function b runs?
[12:51:56] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU'RE saying you have function a and function b, you have function a run and want to wait for it to finish before function b runs
[12:52:16] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: dont know if you will be able to fix that, I see it its only a few ms behind the text though
[12:52:32] <acidjazz> JessC: yes but i dont want to deny clicks firing
[12:53:07] <dblosevn> chrome isnt as far behind as safari
[12:53:07] <JessC> @acidjazz in underscorejs there is a throttle function which would help you, if someone hits it repeatedly the function will begin to delay
[12:53:27] <JessC> @acidjazz as for the timing issue you can set a deferred object
[12:53:48] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: can we delay the display of the text and images?
[12:54:13] <acidjazz> hmm
[12:54:27] <darrennnn> acidjazz: theres a jquery throttle http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[12:54:30] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: not really your doing it the right way, fading the parent
[12:54:52] <acidjazz> yea i dont need something that complex.. they dont each need to completely fire and run async
[12:55:09] <darrennnn> you could pass one as a callback to the other
[12:55:42] <JessC> @darrennnn i think a deferred object would work better than passing it as a callback, more control
[12:57:25] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: okay I wil leave it the way it is and see if there is a problem with others.
[13:01:44] <andrew91841> is there a way to check if an element has a hover event attached to it ?
[13:01:58] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: thanks for the help
[13:03:00] <JessC> @andrew91841 $('something').data('events');
[13:03:42] <JessC> will return you an array and then events['mouseover']

[13:18:28] <louism2_> hey everyone, i am trying to detect the user's browser using $.browser but I am finding that it is not supported on i.e..  Can anyone help me with another way to go?
[13:23:39] <BillCriswell> louism2_: Detect features, not browsers.
[13:23:49] <BillCriswell> What are you trying to do?
[13:24:52] <louism2_> billcriswell: if the browser is ie version 8 or less, display a div
[13:25:47] <BillCriswell> <!--[if lte ie 8]><div>Hi Loser</div><![endif]-->
[13:27:16] <BillCriswell> They're called IE Conditional Comments, by the way.
[13:27:20] <BillCriswell> louism2_: .
[13:28:04] <louism2_> billcriswell: thanks for the help. also like the "hi loser" example
[13:28:35] <BillCriswell> louism2_: No problem at all.
[13:31:44] <louism2_> billcriswell: the reason I am trying to use js/jquery is because I am displaying the message based on a cookie value.  Can I use those conditional comments to set js variable values?
[13:33:10] <BillCriswell> You can use script tags in the IE Conditional Comment.
[13:35:30] <BillCriswell> louism2_: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/detect-ie-in-js-using-conditional-comments/ This seems pretty clever.
[13:36:27] <louism2_> billcriswell: ahhhh, very clever
[13:38:17] <mib_mib> guys, if i have jquery1.4.2 on the page, and then i add jquery1.8.2 , then jquery UI, and then do var myJ = jQuery.noConflict(true)  --- is jquery UI defined within myJ ?
[13:39:33] <burg> hello. it seems that if i programatically check/uncheck a checkbox, "change" event is not triggered. why is that and how can i trigger it?
[13:40:06] <BillCriswell> burg: You probably want to .trigger('click') on the element?
[13:40:42] <BillCriswell> If you do $('input').attr('checked', true); and $('input').attr('checked', false) it won't trigger the change, but $('input').attr('checked', false).trigger('change') will.
[13:41:01] <burg> BillCriswell: i use $(element).attr("checked", "checked"). also $(element).prop("checked", true) doesn`t trigger checked
[13:41:23] <burg> yes, that way seems to work, thank you
[13:41:27] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:42:03] <motaka2> hi I have a div.calendar , it is a calendar over which you can click to pick dates but the click event for $(".calendar").click(function() {alert("a");} doesnt work , can you tell me why ?
[13:45:37] <JessC> @motaka2 did you make sure the divs you're clickin on have the .calendar class?
[13:45:37] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU'RE clickin on have the .calendar class
[13:49:27] <motaka2> JessC: Yes, can the js coder of calendar do something not to allow others to invoke click while clicking on that div ?
[13:49:55] <JessC> depends . do you have an example?
[13:56:20] <motaka2> JessC: no
[14:04:52] <squiggy> hi! :)
[14:07:37] <Krinkle> hi
[14:09:07] <json> Hello everyone!!
[14:10:13] <SmallCode> Okay I have been trying to figure out, after I use $.GET(); is there anyway to check if ALL the images are loaded before calling a piece of code?
[14:10:49] <SmallCode> Hey Gho5t!
[14:10:59] <SmallCode> Your from rochest too
[14:12:17] <SmallCode> Where all the jQueriers at?
[14:14:23] <SmallCode> Is anyone around?
[14:17:41] <JessC> @SmallCode .load
[14:21:06] <burg> how can i set jqueryui tabs not to reload an ajax tab if i visit it the second time?
[14:21:56] <SmallCode> jessC, would I put that at the end of the .get request?
[14:22:12] <MistuhKurtz> SmallCode, I'm writing up something on jsfiddle for you...
[14:22:28] <SmallCode> MistukKurtz, thank you very much!
[14:23:10] <JessC> @SmallCode you would do that on the div you are inserting that request into
[14:23:10] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE inserting that request into
[14:26:57] <SmallCode> jessC
[14:27:00] <SmallCode> @jessc http://jsfiddle.net/drUTX/
[14:27:17] <MistuhKurtz> SmallCode, http://jsfiddle.net/UyDgr/
[14:27:19] <SmallCode> When you click a link with id of load1, get results1.html
[14:27:37] <MistuhKurtz> doesn't include your AJAX request but it demonstrates how you can fire off a function once all of your images load
[14:27:57] <SmallCode> mistuhKurtz, can I update this so that if I dont know the images?
[14:28:00] <MistuhKurtz> only problem I see is that it's not fault-tolerant if an image load fails
[14:28:04] <SmallCode> Like add images to the array?
[14:28:46] <SmallCode> Yeah mistuh thanks, but I gotta have it fault tolerant
[14:28:54] <SmallCode> There has go to be a way to do it
[14:29:17] <MistuhKurtz> well
[14:29:43] <MistuhKurtz> does the load event fire if there's an HTTP response with an error code?
[14:29:54] <MistuhKurtz> because in that case I'm mistaken and you don't have to worry about that part
[14:30:06] <SmallCode> Well
[14:30:18] <SmallCode> it loads code from results1.html
[14:30:25] <SmallCode> and then after it loads that html page
[14:30:34] <SmallCode> it automatically fires the image manipulation thing
[14:30:46] <JessC> @SmallCode you would run the load function on the div you are putting content into
[14:30:46] <b-ot> JessC, no YOU ARE putting content into
[14:31:21] <SmallCode> jessC
[14:31:22] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[14:31:26] <MistuhKurtz> easy enough to make it fault tolerant
[14:31:27] <MistuhKurtz> 1 sec
[14:31:40] <SmallCode> Do I chain it on the .get request?
[14:31:45] <coldhead> my childers
[14:32:19] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/UyDgr/1/
[14:32:41] <MistuhKurtz> My piece of code would be put inside your AJAX callback
[14:32:58] <SmallCode> @jessC you there
[14:32:58] <b-ot> SmallCode, 1 object in it (only a f.e.), and i want to do y if there are serveral objects in it
[14:33:03] <SmallCode> MistuhKurtz one second
[14:33:04] <JessC> yes
[14:33:09] <deckoff> I have a jquery question, what is the policy for asking?
[14:33:10] <MistuhKurtz> take the response, create the array of image sources, and continue on
[14:33:25] <MistuhKurtz> curious what you think of the approach JessC, coldhead ?
[14:33:27] <SmallCode> One sec mistuh jessC has an easier solution
[14:33:44] <SmallCode> @jessC should I chain that .load onto the ajax get request
[14:33:49] <JessC> @deckoff what is your 	question
[14:33:51] <SmallCode> or $('#search results').load(function()
[14:34:10] <JessC> it depends if the same div is populated each time
[14:34:19] <JessC> if it is then no it doesn't have to be
[14:34:25] <deckoff> Can I select an element based on its class, parent and eq()?
[14:34:47] <JessC> @deckoff like all part of the search condition?
[14:35:10] <SmallCode> jessc ill be back in couple minutes have to eat dinner, hope u will be here when i get back
[14:35:25] <JessC> probably for a few more hours
[14:35:31] <MistuhKurtz> deckoff,  $(parent).find('el.class:eq(0)');
[14:35:39] <deckoff> yes, for example <div id="parent"><div class="something">
[14:35:44] <MistuhKurtz> where parent is your parent element object or a selector for it
[14:35:49] <deckoff> ok, I got it, thanx ;)
[14:37:30] <deckoff> Is there any disadvantage if I use div for list of items, but not li???
[14:38:26] <coldhead> li is more "semantic"
[14:39:10] <deckoff> OK, so no memory leaks, and PC overheating , that's good :):)
[14:40:15] <coldhead> those factors would be browser dependent :)
[14:40:20] <Reco> hi there
[14:40:26] <Reco> i have a question, can anybody help me?
[14:40:45] <Hopsy> why do I get notifications when coldhead is talking :p
[14:41:22] <Hopsy> I once set it, dont know how to remove that :')
[14:41:25] <coldhead> because you don't want to miss a precious pearl of my alien wisdom, Hopsy
[14:41:32] <coldhead> you don't need to remove it, don't be silly
[14:41:39] <Hopsy> haha
[14:41:42] <coldhead> just persuade me to change my /nick
[14:41:45] <coldhead> and problem solved
[14:41:46] <coldhead> ?cc
[14:41:47] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[14:42:14] <SmallCode> jessc im back
[14:43:12] <coldhead> welcome back SmallCode
[14:43:19] <SmallCode> hey coldhead
[14:43:25] <SmallCode> How good are you with jquery 1-10?
[14:43:52] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day, SmallCode
[14:43:56] <coldhead> but happy to try to help
[14:43:58] <SmallCode> Oh nvm
[14:44:01] <coldhead> i might learn something
[14:44:11] <SmallCode> Sorry gotta get this done asap
[14:44:11] <SmallCode> lol
[14:44:23] <SmallCode> after im done here
[14:44:25] <coldhead> i respect your decision
[14:44:28] <SmallCode> ill reccomend some resources for you
[14:44:28] <Hopsy> SmallCode: just ask
[14:44:31] <Hopsy> coldhead: is still a noob
[14:45:13] <Hopsy> so what was your question again? ;p
[14:45:16] <SmallCode> Hopsy, jessc and me have been trying to check after html is loaded into a div via .$get()... how would I be able to do something after all the images have been laoded
[14:45:21] <Reco> i need clean one select input and then give it NULL value. how can i do it? 				$("#editor_check_number").val(NULL'); don't work for me
[14:45:22] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[14:45:37] <SmallCode> Reco
[14:45:40] <SmallCode> You mean like no value?
[14:45:54] <SmallCode> $("#editor_check_number").val('');
[14:46:20] <Reco> SmallCode, yes i try and nothing...
[14:46:39] <deckoff> $(parent).find('el.class:eq(0)');  $(parent).children('el.class:eq(0)'); will both selece the same thing? Any advantages of using one over the other?
[14:46:39] <Reco> the select doesn't clean and original value is there.
[14:46:55] <SmallCode> What is #editor_check_number
[14:46:57] <Reco> but in a textbox it work
[14:46:57] <SmallCode> what type of element
[14:47:18] <SmallCode> Is it an input or..?
[14:47:27] <Hopsy> SmallCode: when it succeed?
[14:47:31] <Reco> si a select
[14:47:36] <Reco> is a select
[14:47:37] <SmallCode> Hopsy, that wont work
[14:47:40] <Hopsy> wait, so you are loading images
[14:47:42] <SmallCode> Because images won't be fully loaded it
[14:47:53] <SmallCode> Yeah im loading code, which in return is loading images
[14:47:54] <Hopsy> owh
[14:48:27] <SmallCode> Oh its a select
[14:48:29] <SmallCode> @Reco
[14:48:58] <SmallCode> Reco
[14:49:01] <Reco> yes
[14:49:02] <Reco> i'm here
[14:49:03] <SmallCode> post your code @ pastbin.com
[14:49:05] <SmallCode> pastebin.com
[14:49:10] <Reco> okey :)
[14:49:36] <Hopsy> SmallCode: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5681062/jquery-wait-till-background-images-have-loaded-then-show-element
[14:49:50] <mdedetrich> my checkbox's aren't checking on them, so I think I have some event bound on the checkbox through a parent element
[14:49:57] <mdedetrich> what is the easiest way to diagnose this?
[14:51:17] <Hopsy> https://github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages omg its an unicorn!

[14:52:20] <SmallCode> Coldhead, very nice job for your first day buddy
[14:52:25] <Hopsy> coldhead: but does it work?
[14:52:38] <coldhead> no idea, i didn't test it
[14:52:43] <coldhead> it's just a hope
[14:52:45] <SmallCode> Only thing is though, the images determine the height of the div element
[14:52:47] <Hopsy> and will it blend?
[14:52:52] <coldhead> lol
[14:52:52] <SmallCode> and without the images loaded in, it will malfunction
[14:53:29] <coldhead> you can't make the height: auto?
[14:54:01] <SmallCode> Reco
[14:54:08] <Reco> yes
[14:54:21] <SmallCode> coldhead, no because the plugin blocksit sets the height of the main div when it loads at first
[14:54:31] <SmallCode> so i have to wait till all images are loaded to call the functio n:(
[14:54:52] <SmallCode> or else the height of the div will be like 56px
[14:54:55] <BD-> When binding a click event to a (newly created, but I don't think that matters) element, calling the same function recursively, it keeps on looping, as if something is calling the click event automatically upon binding!
[14:54:57] <SmallCode> and all the images will be hidden
[14:54:59] <coldhead> so... won't my code let you do that SmallCode ?
[14:55:22] <SmallCode> No cold
[14:55:22] <coldhead> you could call blocksit where i have alert()
[14:55:28] <SmallCode> Reco, try using .attr
[14:55:31] <coldhead> and it will only run once all the images are loaded
[14:55:43] <coldhead> i am sorry i am not very good SmallCode. i will stop wasting your time
[14:56:11] <SmallCode> No cold, you gotta fail to succeed
[14:56:24] <SmallCode> Keep trying, and thanks for your input ;)
[14:56:42] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, coldhead you gotta FAIL, to SUCCEED
[14:56:48] <Reco> SmallCode, that don't work, the select has the original value.
[14:56:52] <DevCodex> sup guys.. $('#myselect').html('<select id="test"><option value="1" data-something="hello">testing</option></select'); .. i cant access .data("something") on click (even though i'm using .live('click', function(){ ... }); .. any ideas why dynamically creating the html creates this issue?
[14:56:56] <ryanneufeld> like turning left to turn right
[14:56:57] <DevCodex> do i need to bind to DOM somehow?
[14:57:01] <JessC> @SmallCode this may help https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded

[14:57:45] <SmallCode> I was looking at another piece of code too

[14:59:09] <SmallCode> Okay take me to the page
[14:59:11] <SmallCode> and the jquery
[14:59:34] <Reco> I should not have posted access to my computer into a publicly logged channel
[14:59:37] <mdedetrich> I have an issue where my checkboxes aren't ticking
[14:59:40] <grafi> :P
[14:59:41] <SmallCode> @reco go to teamviewer and generate new password
[14:59:47] <mdedetrich> and I can't seem to find if there is an event bound to it
[14:59:50] <grafi> all type /clear now ^^
[15:00:02] <ryanneufeld> logged publicly
[15:00:31] <JessC> @mdedetrich $('radiobutton').data("events");
[15:00:34] <mdedetrich> oh wait
[15:00:37] <mdedetrich> I found it
[15:01:05] <coldhead> i wish i knew how to use those details to do a server hackings
[15:01:10] <coldhead> but i am too ignorant
[15:01:14] <coldhead> i will /clear too
[15:01:56] <mdedetrich> JessC: https://gist.github.com/6324eacb188f5c3aa165
[15:02:07] <mdedetrich> that code is what is causing the problem (its a custom menu I created)
[15:02:14] <mdedetrich> is there a way to change that code to stop the issue from hapenning
[15:04:00] <ryanneufeld> Reco: I HIGHLY suggest you change the login details for your team viewer
[15:04:04] <ryanneufeld> as the can be seen here http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[15:04:11] <ryanneufeld> and that's permanent
[15:05:48] <coldhead> what is teamviewer anyway?
[15:05:54] <coldhead> some kind of sexy video thing?
[15:08:15] <JessC> @mdedetrich is there any reason why you need to have the event bound to html?
[15:08:37] <mdedetrich> JessC: yes, but I fixed it, just made the function return true
[15:08:56] <mdedetrich> JessC: the event is bound to html because I made a custom menu, and the menu needs to be hidden when someone clicks outside of it
[15:15:52] <versatiletech> JessC: you know there's a Visual Event 2?
[15:19:06] <JessC> yeah
[15:31:20] <JessC> still playing around with my own added a few things i need like being able to step through events, see in which order they are triggered, execution time and disabling the events
[15:31:51] <SmallCode> jessc
[15:31:54] <SmallCode> are you still here?
[15:32:00] <JessC> yes
[15:32:06] <SmallCode> taking a look at that code u sent me
[15:32:36] <Reco> thanks for the help SmallCode
[15:32:39] <JessC> the load method i sent you isn't ideal it won't fire on cached images
[15:32:49] <SmallCode> No problem reco, hope that  tutorial helps you
[15:32:53] <JessC> i think that git repo i sent you will work better
[15:33:02] <SmallCode> jessC, resend it
[15:33:07] <SmallCode> i was out and about helping reco
[15:33:19] <SmallCode> Is it this? https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/blob/master/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js
[15:33:26] <JessC> yep
[15:34:30] <firstclassfunc> is there a source code editor that allows adding comments in a splitscreen, and not directly in the code?
[15:38:18] <SmallCode> jessC, nope doesnt work
[15:45:54] <NaN> how can I access a var from my nav debugger if the var is on $(document).ready ?
[15:46:23] <coldhead> you have to break within document ready
[15:46:27] <coldhead> or a function within there
[15:47:04] <SmallCode> Nan if the variable is inside document.ready() ?
[15:47:24] <NaN> yes, all my code is inside document.ready
[15:47:44] <coldhead> so as long as your pause the debugger within there the var should be visible
[15:48:14] <SmallCode> Yeah not sure waht u mean
[15:48:23] <SmallCode> if u want to access it outside of the doc.ready
[15:48:27] <SmallCode> put it outside
[15:48:35] <SmallCode> jessc, are you here?
[15:49:21] <NaN> I want to access my var from my web console but without using console.log, instead just write the var name on the console cli
[15:49:49] <NaN> like when you make var foo = 'hi there'; and then just write foo on the console and it says "hi there"
[15:49:55] <SmallCode> not sure
[15:49:57] <coldhead> the var is only visible while you are inside the "scope" of the document ready fn
[15:49:59] <SmallCode> never done that
[15:50:02] <coldhead> once that is run the var is inaccessible
[15:50:11] <SmallCode> set bp?
[15:50:15] <coldhead> if you add a debugger; statement at the end of your document ready
[15:50:19] <coldhead> then it will pause there
[15:50:24] <coldhead> and the var should be visible
[15:50:39] <SmallCode> anyone know how to check if images have been loaded after a jquery ajax call?
[15:51:03] <NaN> coldhead: so I can't access vars from the console itself that don't correspond to the global?
[15:51:14] <coldhead> yes, exactly :)
[15:51:17] <coldhead> well said
[15:51:32] <NaN> :(
[15:51:44] <NaN> ok then I will make a global object just for debbug :B
[15:54:22] <coldhead> NaN: this seems to work, if it's any help http://jsfiddle.net/SctDz/
[15:54:31] <NaN> let's see
[15:57:03] <SmallCode> So I am still unsure of how to check if the images have been loaded
[15:57:47] <NaN> coldhead: TypeError: $(document).trigger is not a function
[15:58:13] <NaN> SmallCode: have you tried with Net on firebug?
[15:58:35] <SmallCode> Well
[15:58:39] <SmallCode> the images are load dynamically
[15:58:48] <SmallCode> i wonder if i have to use .live
[15:59:11] <NaN> I think live is deprecated, use on instead
[15:59:53] <SmallCode> Okay
[16:00:30] <SmallCode> So NaN think this over with me
[16:00:41] <SmallCode> User clicks link, the html is loaded in
[16:00:46] <coldhead> NaN: try here http://jsfiddle.net/SctDz/show/
[16:00:46] <SmallCode> the images start loading
[16:01:31] <SmallCode> So now
[16:01:33] <SmallCode> what do i do
[16:01:46] <NaN> coldhead: same error, could be my browser?
[16:02:11] <NaN> SmallCode: append the response to your html
[16:02:15] <DevCodex> k figured it out.. had to go .attr() cuz it was dynamically loaded via .html
[16:02:19] <DevCodex> brills baby brills
[16:02:25] <SmallCode> what do you mean
[16:02:41] <NaN> SmallCode: wait
[16:02:53] <SmallCode> All I want to do is
[16:02:59] <SmallCode> call the .get() request
[16:03:09] <SmallCode> and then after its done loading into div called "search results"
[16:03:17] <SmallCode> once its done loading all the images
[16:03:29] <SmallCode> for now i jsut want it to alert to me its done
[16:03:38] <SmallCode> so i can move up from there to the real thing i want it to do
[16:10:57] <versatiletech> firstclassfunc: ? What DON'T you want?
[16:24:08] <RonWhoCares> Is anyone tell me why this won't run as a JQuery - Ajax ?  http://jsfiddle.net/D2uDs/1/
[16:25:16] <RonWhoCares> - I want to click the button and perform the update --- based on the    .php
[16:26:38] <coldhead> the code looks okay
[16:26:50] <coldhead> are you sure it's sending the right data back from the server?
[16:27:02] <coldhead> can you see a POST request in the network tab of your debugger?
[16:27:17] <SmallCode> Does anyone know how to do an event with jquery live
[16:27:29] <RonWhoCares> coldhead The web page is reloading
[16:27:53] <coldhead> that don't make no sense
[16:28:08] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: is the <button> inside a form?
[16:28:29] <SmallCode> I need to use live on #search-results
[16:28:37] <SmallCode> and figure out if all the images are loaded
[16:28:38] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: Yes it is
[16:28:40] <SmallCode> then, if thats true
[16:28:43] <SmallCode> execute code
[16:28:49] <coldhead> RonWhoCares: ah, then your button is a submit. try this http://jsfiddle.net/D2uDs/2/
[16:29:23] <NaN> SmallCode: http://jsfiddle.net/gtmuG/
[16:29:44] <RonWhoCares> coldhead: You only change the JQuery
[16:30:04] <RonWhoCares> ?
[16:30:12] <coldhead> yes
[16:30:17] <coldhead> i added an e inside the ()
[16:30:18] <RonWhoCares> ok
[16:30:21] <coldhead> and e.preventDefault();
[16:30:24] <coldhead> that is all
[16:30:29] <SmallCode> NaN
[16:30:39] <SmallCode> But what if im waiting on all the images in a divison to load?
[16:32:09] <anew> if i want to apply the same thing to x number of divs in large numbers, what is a better way then jus tlisting them all out ?
[16:32:19] <anew> i.e. my names are div1, div2... divn
[16:34:00] <coldhead> anew: $('[class^="div"]') // matches all divs with classes starting with "div..."
[16:34:06] <coldhead> is that what you mean?
[16:34:42] <anew> coldhead hmmm yeah that could work
[16:34:55] <anew> thx
[16:35:01] <coldhead> anew: you should use better class names :P
[16:35:29] <anew> i mean i have a bunch of repeating divs for images...
[16:35:38] <anew> i just added a number to the end of each name
[16:35:47] <anew> image1, image2, etc
[16:36:30] <coldhead> well whatever works for you, huh
[16:37:03] <NaN> SmallCode: like this? > http://jsfiddle.net/gtmuG/1/
[16:37:12] <anew> actually no that didnt work... that makes all the divs change
[16:37:50] <SmallCode_> NaN yes
[16:37:56] <SmallCode_> Now after they have all been loaded
[16:38:10] <SmallCode_> it should fire a function
[16:38:34] <coldhead> anew: do all your divs have class="div<something>" ?
[16:39:21] <anew> coldhead <class = "image1"> <class = "image2"> <class="image3> etc up and up
[16:39:39] <SmallCode_> But remember nan
[16:39:53] <SmallCode_> we're loading them in via ajax get request
[16:39:58] <ShaiTan> I have this code to create an autocomplete, it works fine and the availableTags array supplies the possible values, now I wish to have the values come from a php file. What do I need to add/change for this to happen?
[16:39:58] <SmallCode_> we load in an entire division
[16:40:08] <coldhead> anew: $('[class^="image"]') ?
[16:40:42] <anew> coldhead i mean i could just put them all into $() with commas, but makes no sense
[16:40:53] <anew> yeah coldhead that gives same results as before
[16:40:56] <SmallCode_> Shaitan, where is it getting these values from?
[16:41:51] <ShaiTan> SmallCode_: var availableTags = [ "value 1", "value 2"......];
[16:41:52] <SmallCode_> NaN any updates?
[16:42:10] <NaN> SmallCode_: sorry man I gotta go
[16:42:15] <SmallCode_> Okay Nan take care, thanks
[16:42:27] <SmallCode_> ShaiTan, you want to pass those variables to a php .get request?
[16:43:01] <ShaiTan> SmallCode_: I wish to get those values from the php request
[16:43:10] <ShaiTan> SmallCode_: the php file looks up the values in a db
[16:43:18] <SmallCode_> Okay
[16:43:46] <coldhead> anew: it works for me http://jsfiddle.net/YDBbc/
[16:43:49] <coldhead> perhaps i misunderstand
[16:44:08] <anew> wait something else is wrong because even with commas all the divs are changing... strange... let me look into that thanks coldhead
[16:44:28] <ShaiTan> SmallCode_: I can do source: '/foo.php', but then I do not get the comma delimited values in the text box
[16:44:31] <coldhead> good luck anew
[16:45:03] <SmallCode_> If you want to get commas
[16:45:04] <SmallCode_> explode it
[16:45:08] <ShaiTan> SmallCode_: I need to have the response()
[16:45:10] <SmallCode_> look up javascript explode
[16:45:18] <coldhead> ?mdc split

[16:45:33] <SmallCode_> there ya go
[16:45:49] <ShaiTan> var terms = split( this.value ); is what I am doing
[16:46:30] <ShaiTan> it works fine with the array of data, I just need to change the source from a variable, to a php file
[16:47:31] <coldhead> i just need a general unified theory
[16:47:55] <anew> ok coldhead.... it was applying the same function to all of them (doh) , i need to apply it to each div, but a seperate hover event

[17:05:22] <J1> Hello everyone, I'm working on trying to create a draggable background image, I found a script that works great but I came to find out when applying a div (content) over my background the content div is moving the background as well; I know when declaring something like this it means everything inside the draggable div as well.. Is there a way to avoid this and make the content div function properly (as in text select) - http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/
[17:06:14] <J1> I did try to play around with z-index but I don't think that matters as no matter the index it's still inside the background (.wrap) div
[17:06:42] <matteu> J: Study the jQuery API on propagation
[17:06:49] <matteu> J: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[17:10:43] <J1> "Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. " will this work on child elements tho?
[17:11:11] <J1> And would that only be applied ot things like calling .wrap in another jquery?
[17:11:29] <matteu> J1:  The idea is that when you click on the div, which is a child element of the element which registers the click event, the click event 'bubbles up' the DOM.
[17:11:46] <matteu> J1: Eventually that click event reaches the background and performs the action associated with the event.
[17:12:20] <matteu> J1: If you don't want the child div to trigger the click event of the parent, you have to stop that bubbling, which is what propagation handling means in jQuery.
[17:14:43] <matteu> J1: If you're asking whether or not 'stopPropagation' would only apply to elements that you add through jQuery later, no.  The DOM will be used to propagate jQuery events regardless of how it is altered after initial load.
[17:23:00] <sunbeam> Hi, I'd like to know how I can best check whether a li.state-open exists in my ul
[17:23:10] <sunbeam> anyone know whats the best way? check for .length?
[17:24:09] <dblosevn> if ($('li.state-open').length) { do something } @sunbeam
[17:25:38] <Reco> quit
[17:25:39] <dblosevn> or if you want a reference to the node $('li.state-open').each(function() { //this is a reference to li.state-open });
[17:26:25] <sunbeam> ok thanks a lot lets check
[17:28:25] <gringochapin> Hi all. Getting a really strange issue with jQuery Mobile. In my pagebeforeshow handler, my footer div is completely missing.  if I do $(this).html(), I can see the header and main divs, but not the footer. If I set $(this) to a window variable, and then later go look at it in the console, the footer is there.  Any idea what's going on? Is the footer not added until after pagebeforeshow events are fired for some reason?
[17:30:07] <jrivera> So after applying the stopPropagation event to my .no-drag div; it stops the whole draggable background - http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/1/
[17:35:27] <sunbeam> dblosevn: and assiging the li right after the li.controls (this is always the first li in the ul) a class '.state-open' ?
[17:46:16] <jrivera> The more examples I look at for e.stopPropagation(); doesnt seem like it's the right event for what I need
[17:48:40] <sunbeam> anyone?
[17:49:19] <jrivera> I only saw your reply to dblosevn, sorry.
[17:49:32] <dblosevn> sunbeam: i have no clue i havent seen your source
[17:49:43] <dblosevn> sorry was reading an email
[17:50:23] <coldhead> sunbeam: $('li.state-open').append('<li>') will only work if .state-open is there
[17:50:28] <coldhead> otherwise silent failure
[17:50:35] <sunbeam> np
[17:50:46] <dblosevn> the first snippet i showed you will simply test to see if there is an li.state-open in the dom
[17:50:49] <sunbeam> no i don't need it to append
[17:51:03] <sunbeam> yes, but this is something different i want to achieve sorry iw wasnt clear
[17:51:04] <dblosevn> if there is the code will run
[17:51:43] <sunbeam> i want simply to give the 2nd <li> (if this second li exists) AFTER <li class='controls'> a class '.state-open'
[17:51:44] <dblosevn> the second snippet I showed you will actually give you a reference to the li.state-open node(s) within the anyomous functions
[17:51:50] <dblosevn> oh
[17:52:17] <dblosevn> $('li.controls').next().addClass('state-open');
[17:53:30] <dblosevn> if theres no li.controls that does nothing
[17:53:51] <dblosevn> if there is it adds a class (state-open) to the next li after li.controls
[17:54:03] <sunbeam> ok nice
[17:54:13] <sunbeam> so you dont have to define <li> in next()
[17:54:18] <dblosevn> no
[17:54:25] <dblosevn> only an li should follow an li
[17:55:29] <dblosevn> also tyhat will do nothing if there is not another li after li.controls
[17:56:28] <jrivera> you sure about that db?
[17:58:00] <sunbeam> hmm
[17:58:07] <sunbeam> jQuery('li.nav-controls').next().addClass('visible-primary');
[17:58:14] <sunbeam> this is what i try, but it doesn't exist
[17:58:34] <sunbeam> while everything exists
[17:58:42] <jrivera> what doesnt exist
[17:59:03] <dblosevn> well you told me li.controls and you just said li.nav-controls
[17:59:05] <coldhead> so cold
[17:59:14] <ansdev1> <3
[17:59:27] <dblosevn> ?demo @sunbeam
[17:59:28] <bot-t> sunbeam, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:59:31] <sunbeam> sorry i made a mistake hehe
[17:59:43] <sunbeam> ok
[18:01:12] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/rMpQ4/
[18:01:15] <sunbeam> strange
[18:01:16] <sunbeam> its ok here
[18:01:44] <jrivera> Hey db you seem pretty knowledgeable; mind taking a shot at helping me out with my problem? I am trying to figure out how to prevent my .no-drag div from triggering the background drag event on my .wrap div. I was told read up on stopPropagation but that seems like the opposite from what I am trying to achieve - http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/2/
[18:01:50] <dblosevn> something else in your code is breaking
[18:01:51] <jrivera> dblosevn*
[18:02:36] <dblosevn> jrivera: standing outside smoking give me a min
[18:03:02] <jrivera> dblosevn: you tellin yo cat to type for ya ;) haha okay thnx
[18:03:29] <dblosevn> lol im aleergic to cats this is my dog typing
[18:03:39] <jrivera> Ahhh Hello Dog
[18:03:46] <dblosevn> ruff
[18:04:22] <dblosevn> i injected him  with nanobots and control him with my jedi mind power and jquery
[18:04:53] * jrivera science
[18:05:35] <coldhead> $('.canine').removeAttr('freewill')
[18:05:42] <jrivera> ROFL
[18:05:47] <jrivera> messed up
[18:08:25] <dblosevn> $.post('/mind/', {freewill: true}, function(ret) { alert(ret.where) } {{alert}} /dev/null
[18:08:36] <dblosevn> });
[18:09:19] <dblosevn> <?php `cat freewill > /dev/null`; ?>
[18:10:00] <dblosevn> jrivera: what am i looking at now?
[18:10:17] <jrivera> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/2/
[18:10:34] <jrivera> What I am trying to do is make the background draggable but not the content
[18:11:07] <jrivera> As in, I dont want the background dragging if iam trying to select text in content
[18:11:48] <amh345> I've got x number of  "add to cart" links.  each time add to cart is clicked it adds a text field to my form with a value equaling a specific product_id as well as a quantity box.   what would be the best way to update the quantity text box with a +1 instead of adding a new row of inputs if the one clicked is already in the cart?
[18:13:26] <gringochapin> So, in case anyone was watching, I solved my earlier problem.  Looks like if you use a fixed footer, the footer element won't be a child of the this variable in the pagebeforeshow event handler.  Not what I was expecting.  Anyone know if this is a bug or just undocumented, or perhaps even documented and I just don't know where to find it?
[18:15:45] <dblosevn> jrivera: http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/3/
[18:15:51] <jrivera> amh345: Maybe something like find() your product_id from your click event then textfield replaceWith('x1')
[18:16:10] <gringochapin> amh345 I'd probably do a $input = $('input[value="PRODUCTID"]');
[18:16:17] <dblosevn> jrivera: something like that :-D
[18:16:26] <jrivera> dblosevn: ahh yesss
[18:16:32] <gringochapin> Then, check $input.length to make sure it = 1.  If it equals 0, there is no row for that product.
[18:16:46] <gringochapin> If it equals 2, you messed up because there are two.
[18:16:49] <dblosevn> jrivera: bonus i even fixed the text selection problem
[18:17:57] <jrivera> dblosevn: thats interesting you have to call the same mouseon function; is that to specify what to stop propagtimg
[18:18:18] <dblosevn> well... you have to tell javascript what event not to bubble
[18:18:35] <jrivera> Theres really no prevent all from bubbling? (just curious)
[18:18:41] <dblosevn> no
[18:18:44] <jrivera> on a specific element
[18:18:46] <jrivera> ok
[18:19:00] <dblosevn> you have to attach a listener that you dont want to bubble and stopPropagation on it
[18:20:39] <dblosevn> as in this case if you dont attach a mounsedown.dbg listener to the no-drag div windows recieves the mousedown.dbg event as it has a listener attached
[18:21:58] <jrivera> Could mouseover be applied the same way
[18:22:03] <gringochapin> amh345: Did that help?
[18:22:23] <dblosevn> jrivera: you can do that with any event
[18:25:09] <jrivera> $(".no-drag").mouseover(function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); });
[18:26:04] <dblosevn> $('.no-drag').on('mousedown.dbg', function(e) {e.stopPropagation(); }).mouseover(function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); }).disableSelection(); :-)
[18:26:11] <dblosevn> or
[18:26:13] <jrivera> lmao
[18:26:33] <jrivera> ok so no matter what to stop bubbling it has to attributed to the orginal event
[18:26:46] <dblosevn> although you dont have a mouseover listener so you shouldnt have to do that
[18:26:59] <jrivera> yeah actually meant mousedown
[18:27:19] <dblosevn> my code does what you need
[18:27:23] <jrivera> http://jsfiddle.net/QVXVx/4/
[18:27:26] <jrivera> that actually works
[18:27:38] <jrivera> Yeah, I appricate that, thank you. Merely jsut trying to understand further :)
[18:28:32] <dblosevn> basically this, if your not listening to an event on an element the event is propagted further up the food chain till hit either hits the top of the dom or... find an element with a listener attached to that event
[18:29:51] <dblosevn> so without binding a listner to the element you want to stop propgating on it will contiue up the dom
[18:31:19] <jrivera> Okay I see, tyvm for clearing that up
[18:31:59] * jrivera pets Dog. Ty for being the medium.
[18:32:09] * dblosevn ruff
[18:32:22] * dblosevn time to find some scooby snacks
[18:34:47] <amh345> gringochapin: thanks for the help. the thing is i think i need to scan all the product_ids already in the cart.  and then chec that product_ids quantity text_box.  so i need to pair them together.  oh man.
[18:34:52] <amh345> this isnt going to be easy
[18:35:37] <dblosevn> why?
[18:35:47] <dblosevn> @amh345
[18:36:06] <dblosevn> seems like a lot of work that could be much simpler
[18:36:15] <dblosevn> are you using a table for the cart?
[18:36:24] <amh345> the text text fields (product_id and quantity) do have similarities.  they have a unique number in the name that can pair them together. for example > customer_orders_attrib_1353549963230_product_id  and customer_orders_attrib_1353549963230_quantity
[18:36:40] <gringochapin> am345: if they're close to each other in the dom, it shouldn't be that hard at all.  What does the markup for one of your rows look like?
[18:36:48] <dblosevn> pastebin me a couple rows from the cart
[18:37:06] <gringochapin> amh345: Sorry, misspelled your nick on that last.
[18:37:17] <amh345> the source isnt much of anything as of yet as i've been dicking around with it.   i will post what's there now.
[18:37:21] <amh345> one minute please.
[18:37:26] <amh345> thanks again guys, i appreciate it.
[18:37:33] <dblosevn> i just need a couple rows of the html
[18:37:52] <dblosevn> a full working fiddle would be nicer though :-)
[18:38:33] <coldhead> so cold
[18:38:42] <dblosevn> ya it is pretty cold out
[18:38:48] <gringochapin> amh345: dblosevn should be able to help you out. My IRC client is leaking memory like crzy so it will probably crash soon.
[18:39:03] <amh345> ok, sounds good.  thanks gringochapin
[18:39:10] <amh345> pastebin is coming up in a min
[18:39:14] <gringochapin> amh345: luck.
[18:40:19] * dblosevn still want some scooby snacks, gonna look at this code then go find some
[18:41:02] <jrivera> lol
[18:41:14] <amh345> ok, here's the pastebin http://pastebin.com/WK60MLJC
[18:41:31] <Foxhoundz> Does anyone know of any jQuery modal alert box plugin that doesn't require any CSS/Image assets
[18:41:35] <Foxhoundz> just the javascript goodness?
[18:41:46] <amh345> the inputs will eventually be hidden text fields, but for now i just need to see them
[18:41:48] <jrivera> yeah, alert()
[18:42:53] <dblosevn> amh345: you got a wrapper around therows?
[18:43:17] <amh345> i do. a few actually, dblosevn .
[18:43:21] <Foxhoundz> jrivera, I prefer something that uses HTML to preset tne modal box, instead of the baked in alert box.
[18:43:24] <Foxhoundz> But thanks for trying
[18:43:25] <dblosevn> just one will suffice
[18:43:40] <jrivera> Foxhoundz, it's possible but it would be one ugly box
[18:44:02] <jrivera> Usually any minimal alert plugin will work just remove the css
[18:44:07] <dblosevn> whats a name of the wrapper the rows are chilrdren of?
[18:44:30] <amh345> im still tweaking it all. but it's basically going to be <div id><p><input hidden product id><input hidden quantity>Name of item  Quantity</p></div>
[18:44:39] <amh345> dblosevn: ^ that was for you
[18:44:50] <dblosevn> also this wrapper only will have rows in it correct?
[18:45:01] <amh345> that's right, yes
[18:45:27] <jrivera> Foxhoundz: http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/#examples
[18:46:25] <jrivera> Using an alert like this you will need inline css for the magic to work and to make it presentable
[18:47:03] <Foxhoundz> jrivera, for context, the reason why I want to avoid using plugins that use css/images is because I'm working on a content script (a.k.a. userscript). This modal box will act as the options windows to set the parameters for the script. It's possible to incorporate CSS and image resources within content scripts, but it's too much of a pain to do so.
[18:47:07] <amh345> how can you make a alert/ modal work without css to set it's index?
[18:47:24] <amh345> oh, i guess you could do css in jquery :/
[18:47:34] <jrivera> thats what i mean by inline amh345
[18:47:38] <Foxhoundz> amh345, to clarify, inline
[18:47:44] <dblosevn> amh345: http://pastebin.com/kWe1WW4v
[18:47:54] <Foxhoundz> I don't mind injecting css, but I don't want to reference some giant css file
[18:47:59] <Foxhoundz> I want it to be self contained
[18:48:18] <dblosevn> Foxhoundz: use fancybox, its pretty lightweight
[18:48:28] <amh345> dblosevn: wow, that was fast.  try it now
[18:48:34] <dblosevn> Foxhoundz: and i have never had it conflict with my stylesheets
[18:49:10] <dblosevn> amh345: ??
[18:49:47] <amh345> sorry, i ment ILL try it now
[18:49:56] <amh345> also, check your pm's dblosevn
[18:52:45] <jrivera> Foxhoundz: Did you check the link I sent
[18:53:08] <jrivera> plugin is 2.9k
[18:53:25] <jrivera> and the css (which you could do inline and even less if you want it bare) 500 bytes
[18:53:32] <Foxhoundz> yeah I'm looking at it
[18:53:46] <Foxhoundz> This was the kind of thing I had in mind
[18:53:48] <jrivera> so essentially just leave out the css and do a few inline
[18:53:52] <jrivera> css
[18:54:02] <jrivera> and you should be good
[18:54:31] <jrivera> things like: display, position and margin
[18:57:50] <jacob11> hello guys I need some help. Basically i want my menu to show/hide divs as I click them. But I cannot figure how can I initilaize div from the home page. any help?
[18:58:38] <jrivera> ?demo @jacob11
[18:58:39] <bot-t> jacob11, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:58:48] <jacob11> here's what I got so far: http://pastie.org/5416029
[18:59:09] <jrivera> Well first I see a spelling error
[18:59:10] <jacob11> but "div" variable is initilized everytime I click anchor
[18:59:23] <jrivera> unless u have a class .lnk
[18:59:25] <jaha> bit off topic but maybe you guys can help, any idea why I cant seem to render an iframe inside a handlebars/mustache template?
[18:59:30] <jacob11> I have a class .lnk
[18:59:53] <jaha> am i missing something in why other tags would render and parse but the iframe isnt?
[19:00:27] <jrivera> toggle seems like a much easier route than what youve taken
[19:00:49] <jacob11> but I have 5-6 anchors
[19:00:58] <jrivera> can u show me ur html
[19:01:18] <jacob11> and by default only one div is shown
[19:01:29] <jacob11> other ones are display: none
[19:01:53] <jacob11> I want when I click specific anchor to show div for that but hide previous one
[19:04:54] <jacob11> here's html
[19:04:54] <jacob11> http://pastie.org/5416046
[19:05:05] <jacob11> href is there for some other purpose fyi.
[19:11:04] <zest> hi
[19:11:29] <jacob11> can I initialize variable after .ready(function)?
[19:14:24] <zest> Hi, I'm integrating ddpowerzoomer.js (http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/powerzoomer.htm)to my site, somehow the zooming works on firefox but not on chrome. Can someone help me why this is so?
[19:14:37] <zest> here's the link: http://nashvilleindian.com/aaj-ki-nari/product-detail?product_id=22
[19:14:45] <jrivera> jacob11 it might be teh way you're calling var div = $('#home');
[19:14:53] <zest> I think it may be due to CSS or something..
[19:14:58] <zest> Can anyone help me?
[19:15:08] <jrivera> No nvm thats not it
[19:17:46] <jacob11> yes it is! :D
[19:17:49] <jacob11> i forgot ' '
[19:17:56] <zest> help!
[19:18:08] <jrivera> lol
[19:18:22] <jacob11> http://pastie.org/5416103
[19:18:36] <jacob11> this is the code which works for me
[19:18:40] <jacob11> thanks! :)
[19:19:52] <jrivera> Is the id.show working?
[19:20:28] <jacob11> yep
[19:20:48] <jacob11> http://www.studio-morpheus.com/ try it :D
[19:22:25] <relipse> is there a way to tell the browser that a particular value has changed in a text input (that way the onchange gets fired after it loses focus)?
[19:23:09] <jrivera> jacob11 can you try something for me
[19:23:24] <jrivera> and put that 'var div = $('#home');' inside 'if (div.is(':visible')) {'
[19:23:27] <jrivera> and see if that works too
[19:23:48] <jrivera> I think because you attached it to a click event
[19:23:55] <jrivera> and putting it outside youve made it global
[19:26:11] <jrivera> zest: I viewed the dynamicdrive link on chrome and it works fine
[19:26:43] <zest> In here: http://nashvilleindian.com/aaj-ki-nari/product-detail?product_id=22
[19:26:50] <zest> It doesn't, wonder why?
[19:27:16] <jrivera> That also works but it looks off
[19:27:27] <zest> Yes, that's my problem..
[19:27:44] <zest> I'm thinking it has something to do with my CSS, but coudln't locate it ..
[19:29:03] <jrivera> zest: Ill take a look
[19:29:15] <zest> Thanks!
[19:29:40] <zest> I disabled all my CSS and it works great. Wonder which one to alter?
[19:33:26] <jrivera> Oh zest, dat code! >.<
[19:33:44] <zest> Yes >.<
[19:34:26] <zest> Even in the original code, one with no tables, or before the integration, the zooming is off.
[19:35:28] <jrivera> Its your reset.css
[19:35:38] <jrivera> Whats teh url to ur resset
[19:36:06] <jrivera> Me thinks...
[19:37:19] <zest> http://nashvilleindian.com/shop/css/reset.css
[19:40:03] <zest> i disabled base.css and it looked fine.
[19:40:09] <jrivera> yep
[19:40:12] <jrivera> was just gunna say that
[19:40:17] <zest> Ok :)
[19:40:20] <jrivera> its
[19:40:28] <jrivera> img { max-width: 100%; }
[19:40:33] <jrivera> thats messing up ur script
[19:40:36] <zest> really?
[19:40:39] <jrivera> yep
[19:40:41] <zest> How do I get over it?
[19:40:47] <jrivera> base.css line 365
[19:40:51] <zest> ok
[19:41:03] <jrivera> img{ max-width:100%;}
[19:41:52] <zest> I removed it :S
[19:41:57] <zest> Thanks lots bro!
[19:42:10] <zest> Hope it doesn't mess up anything..
[19:42:31] <jrivera> thats a weird tag to put on all images
[19:42:56] <jrivera> and no problem :P
[19:43:03] <zest> :D
[19:44:10] <coldhead> in the kitchen whiskey-drunk / i pray to someone else's god / that you'll keep quiet
[19:45:15] <jrivera> drinkin' old fashions? :)
[19:49:14] <zest> In http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/ddpowerzoomer.js - how do I change dynamically the zoomed image from outside the script?
[19:49:53] <zest> I tried adding id to the zoomed IMG tag, and changed the src by using $('#zoom_img').attr('src', '/shop/images/products/main/' + f );
[19:49:59] <zest> but it doesn't work dynamically..
[19:50:30] <zest> It does though changed src when I alert() it's src - zoom_img that is..
[19:50:55] <zest> ^ I mean it shows it changed when I did alert to confirm change
[19:52:36] <zest> IT changed, but whenever I hover back to the main image, it returns back to the original..
[19:52:58] <zest> How do I change the variable that holds the src from outside?
[19:53:06] <zest> I've done this type before, but forgot it now :S
[19:53:45] <zest> How do I access this options.largeimagesrc variable from outside?
[19:54:01] <zest> please take a look http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/ddpowerzoomer.js
[19:59:36] <coldhead> you can't, zest
[19:59:40] <coldhead> it's not public
[19:59:50] <zest> Ok.
[20:00:00] <zest> I just made a change somewhere..
[20:02:40] <coldhead> hey Guest21584
[20:03:04] <Guest21584> hey oô
[20:15:04] <zest> Got it to work! Thank you experts for the help!
[20:16:31] <coldhead> great job, zest
[20:16:36] <coldhead> why don't you take 5
[20:16:46] <zest> thanks! :D
[20:16:48] <zest> 5?
[20:16:52] <coldhead> 5 minutes
[20:16:55] <coldhead> for a break
[20:17:06] <zest> haha will do :)

[20:50:55] <bot-t> coldhead, SKLIZZORCH!
[21:06:20] <tw2113> rmurphey, watching your SanFran2012 talk. Interesting stuff that i should probably look into more
[21:06:52] <Inkoniq-QA> who
[21:08:58] <relipse> can someone please login to http://cworklog.com u:test116 p:test116 and help me figure out why the header is broken from the tiny progress bar?
[21:11:42] <jrockjiggz> relipse: this channel is for jquery related questions
[21:12:02] <jrockjiggz> relipse: plus your question is vague and not helpful
[21:12:51] <coldhead> eh it's not like there were a lot of other questions
[21:13:21] <tw2113> none from you coldhead ?
[21:13:44] <jrockjiggz> relipse: i looked, don't know what your issue is
[21:14:12] <jrockjiggz> relipse: other than add:    top: 50px; to .lefttopbar
[21:15:41] <coldhead> #unfinished {float: left}
[21:18:12] <relipse> the logout and settings is supposed to be on the right side
[21:19:22] <relipse> float left didnt' do it
[21:19:26] <relipse> use chrome to try it out live
[21:19:29] <relipse> and then tell me what you did
[21:20:42] <relipse> you guys need to see it when it's not broke
[21:20:49] <relipse> then you will understand what it means when it is broke
[21:21:24] <coldhead> screenshot would be helpful
[21:21:38] <coldhead> #Header {text-align: right} also seems sensible
[21:21:54] <coldhead> css is hard
[21:22:23] <tw2113> isn't it your 2nd day on css coldhead ?
[21:22:48] <relipse> yeah but the progress bar is supposed to be next to the last icon
[21:22:54] <relipse> ok let me try text-align: right
[21:23:19] <coldhead> this is what i ended up with http://i.imgur.com/Y1Dli.png
[21:23:32] <coldhead> you have too much HTML
[21:24:54] <relipse> oh perfect coldhead
[21:24:58] <relipse> how did you fix it
[21:25:05] <coldhead> the two changes i said
[21:25:06] <relipse> i can't get the progress bar up on the top like you did
[21:25:16] <relipse> ok refresh the page and start from there
[21:25:35] <coldhead> i closed that page many sites ago
[21:25:50] <relipse> wait a sec thats not right either, the contractor's work log logo is messed up
[21:25:57] <relipse> it should be inbetween the 2 black bars
[21:27:23] <coldhead> ugh maybe your html is broke
[21:27:29] <coldhead> it's a direct child of body
[21:31:02] <coldhead> naturally you have this project under version control and can easily revert
[21:31:07] <coldhead> of course
[21:34:56] <coldhead> the main thing is i just rememered i have pear cider at home
[21:35:02] <coldhead> that was a thoughtful give to myself
[21:35:06] <coldhead> good work coldhead, take 5
[21:38:59] <tw2113> don't hurt your arm patting your own back coldhead :)
[21:39:35] <coldhead> good point, i need that arm for putting the cider in me
[21:39:43] <tw2113> mmm cider
[21:46:36] <xboi209> what's the difference between done and success in $.ajax?
[21:49:39] <xboi209> guess no one wants to bite :/
[21:52:17] <matteu> xboi209: 'done' will execute regardless of AJAX success/failure, success will execute only if the request is successful
[21:52:30] <xboi209> k
[21:52:34] <relipse> coldhead: u there?
[21:52:40] <coldhead> sure, why not
[21:52:41] <relipse> i made the changes you asked for: http://cworklog.com/work_log.php
[21:52:55] <relipse> but how do I get the logo and Filter text in the black bar
[21:53:19] <coldhead> how did you get them out in the first place?
[21:53:38] <relipse> when that <div id="unfinished"> got added
[21:53:52] <relipse> if you click the progress bar and stop the time log you will see what i mean
[21:54:06] <coldhead> #logoblock {margin-top: -142px}
[21:54:17] <relipse> won't that screw up the normal view?
[21:54:39] <coldhead> i don't know man
[21:54:45] <coldhead> it looks okay to me
[21:54:46] <coldhead> ?tias
[21:54:46] <bot-t> Try It And See
[21:55:29] <relipse> didn't work

[22:05:45] <relipse2> that will start the time log
[22:05:54] <relipse2> and the "unfinished" time log will appear at the top left
[22:06:05] <relipse2> but notice how the log out is slightly misplaced
[22:07:32] <relipse2> log out text is too far to the right
[22:07:36] <relipse2> it needs some padding or something
[22:07:43] <relipse2> without messing up the original
[22:08:59] <coldhead> .imgLinkTableSmall { float: left }
[22:09:34] <coldhead> yeah, #Header { padding-right: 1em; }
[22:10:52] <relipse2> both of those changes?
[22:12:44] <coldhead> yes, they do 2 different things
[22:13:02] <coldhead> as you could easily verify using your debugger :)
[22:14:21] <relipse2> ok that looks much better
[22:14:40] <relipse2> but it is still not exactly the same
[22:15:11] <relipse2> are you so helpful because you are a good hearted christian?
[22:16:42] <coldhead> no i think it's because i am terribly lonely
[22:17:10] <relipse2> oh
[22:17:13] <relipse2> well you'll come around
[22:18:10] <coldhead> only when i find out where you live
[22:18:23] <relipse2> ip lookup isn't that hard
[22:18:37] <coldhead> i don't "do" network stuff
[22:18:41] <coldhead> it's too hard for me
[22:38:49] <ryanneufeld> `twss @coldhead
[22:38:50] <b-ot> coldhead, That's what she said
[22:51:57] <coldhead> kill meee

[23:14:16] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/ can anyone help me get this working i'm going craZy... i need to set this up for x number of classes
[23:14:25] <anew> if i add more then one class it breaks
[23:15:06] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/ weird it works here
[23:15:08] <anew> but not live
[23:15:10] <anew> grrr
[23:20:18] <anew> well how would i write all those functions into one? so i dont have to copy/paste the same function 30 times ... ?
[23:22:51] <anew> anyone ?
[23:29:06] <anew> anyone? hover ??
[23:30:10] <zhulikas> anew, http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/5/
[23:30:15] <zhulikas> compose maybe like this
[23:30:19] <zhulikas> there are many ways
[23:31:19] <anew> Zhulikas, but then i'd have to write that 30+ times ? still inefficient isnt it, or is that the only way
[23:32:03] <zhulikas> http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/6/
[23:32:05] <zhulikas> then this
[23:32:29] <zhulikas> make all divs have same class
[23:32:46] <zhulikas> actually now you no longer need that bla
[23:32:52] <anew> weird, but when i do that on my live site... they all change when i hover over only one... so if i have 25, and hover over one, they all start changing
[23:33:02] <zhulikas> http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/7/
[23:33:19] <zhulikas> no idea what's wrong there :)
[23:33:25] <anew> yeah that's what i had before and didnt work wtf
[23:33:35] <anew> ok will keep trying thanks
[23:33:49] <zhulikas>  np
[23:33:58] <zhulikas> that beach looks familiar ;)
[23:34:14] <zhulikas> or not, that's not the same bridge in there...
[23:34:15] <zhulikas> :|
[23:34:30] <zhulikas> it would be too great of a coinsidence if that was the same beach I think of :)
[23:37:32] <anew> heh
[23:55:01] <crath> Hey, I found a bug on "http://api.jquery.com/Types/" but bugs.jquery.com is down. Does anyone know if those pages are a wiki or github?
[23:57:20] <anew> Zhulikas are u still there... i found that if i hit back on my browser, it works... but if i load the page fresh it doesnt
[23:58:03] <zhulikas> huh
[23:58:51] <anew> if i load the page new, or hit refresh.... all the divs change by themselves........however, if i click a link on that page - then click back to go to previous page (with the jq), the divs load properly when i hover
[23:59:01] <anew> wtf how does that work
[23:59:13] <zhulikas> http://jsfiddle.net/KdnWn/8/
[23:59:15] <zhulikas> a slight improvement
[23:59:28] <zhulikas> may be the cause
