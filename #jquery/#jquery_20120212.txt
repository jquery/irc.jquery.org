[00:50:26] <Mehrdad> does passing an event name that does not exist to bind() create an event automatically?
[00:59:36] <Ringish> Why won't this work: http://pastebin.com/V8uHRAZZ ?
[01:01:31] <Ringish> Please help me
[01:03:54] <ahmed_> hello every one
[01:06:05] <Ringish> http://pastebin.com/V8uHRAZZ This isn't working. Why?
[01:06:55] <ahmed_> Please anybody help me with this problem http://paste.pocoo.org/show/549638/
[01:08:57] <john-dev> ahmed_, you could rather provide any checkbox with its own id but, there are multiple checkboxes clickable..
[01:09:40] <john-dev> else use .length and .index
[01:13:23] <Ringish> Nobody? http://pastebin.com/V8uHRAZZ
[01:14:32] <john-dev> Ringish, whats wrong with it?
[01:14:51] <john-dev>  $("image").attr("src", currentID); ->  $("#image").attr("src", currentID);
[01:14:56] <Ringish> john-dev, the image won't change
[01:15:20] <john-dev> >
[01:15:20] <john-dev> $("category").mouseover(function() { -> >
[01:15:20] <john-dev> $(".category").mouseover(function() {
[01:16:19] <john-dev> http://pastebin.com/1xKz5HFC
[01:16:22] <john-dev> try that one
[01:16:22] <Ringish> Thanks a lot john-dev, I'm new to this lol
[01:16:48] <john-dev> no problem, IDs are matched using #, classes using .

[01:35:14] <zargath> Hello
[01:40:22] <LukeNukem> hellow
[01:40:22] <LukeNukem> how do i assign a variable to the value of a hidden input field?
[01:41:26] <john-dev> var xx=$('#id_of_input_field').val()
[01:42:48] <john-dev> ah, LukeNukem again :P
[01:43:21] <LukeNukem> i had to remake all those stuff
[01:43:21] <LukeNukem> :>
[01:43:25] <LukeNukem> because i did not overlook the possibility of more than one output you see ;>
[01:43:53] <john-dev> :-)
[01:45:08] <LukeNukem> john-dev, after i do that, i alert the the variable but i get output as one whereas the value in the input field is 1,4 and 5
[01:45:08] <LukeNukem> depending on the looping
[01:45:31] <john-dev> sure
[01:45:40] <john-dev> thats what ou wanted
[01:45:43] <LukeNukem> no
[01:45:47] <LukeNukem> i wanted the value of the field
[01:45:59] <LukeNukem> the value can be 1, 4 or 5
[01:46:11] <LukeNukem> depending on which one i clicked
[01:46:27] <john-dev> yes, the var xx gets assigned with the value of the hiddden field
[01:46:37] <john-dev> whatever you type in there will be displayed
[01:46:41] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/838815/
[01:46:43] <LukeNukem> LOOK
[01:46:58] <LukeNukem> there are three hidden input fields with values 1,3 and 5 respectively
[01:47:24] <john-dev> line?
[01:47:24] <john-dev> line?
[01:47:38] <LukeNukem> if i like the like button on the first status update it should show 1
[01:47:44] <LukeNukem> on the third it should show three and on fifth it should show 5
[01:47:57] <LukeNukem> 30
[01:48:01] <LukeNukem> the switch case
[01:49:10] <john-dev> well, id shows the value of #status_id
[01:49:22] <john-dev> thats what you asked for
[01:50:55] <LukeNukem> john-dev,
[01:52:33] <john-dev> or do you want to set the value of the inputfield to the value of a var?
[01:53:42] <LukeNukem> listen man
[01:53:42] <LukeNukem> i have three status updates
[01:53:42] <LukeNukem> each of them have hidden input fields
[01:53:47] <LukeNukem> with value 1, 3 and 5
[01:53:55] <LukeNukem> so when i hit the like button in status update number 1
[01:54:00] <LukeNukem> it supposed to show 1 as output
[01:54:22] <LukeNukem> on the second status update the output should be 3, and the last status update the output should be 5(depending the mysql row id)
[01:58:53] <LukeNukem> john-dev, PLEASE HELP T_T
[02:06:29] <squeakytoy> when using the "data" in a ajax-request, is that purely for query data? How do I send post data?
[02:18:44] <squeakytoy> aww, man. i am going crazy :-)
[02:19:01] <squeakytoy> i cant even determine if my jquery script is doing a correct POST request
[02:19:13] <squeakytoy> what a bad start for the day
[02:19:48] <OverL> hi guys, i have a problem, i use AJAX, but when i click 1st time jquery send 1 request, when i click 2nd time jquery send 2 requests etc.
[02:31:26] <squeakytoy> this might be a stupid question, but how do you send "post data"? with jquery ajax?
[02:38:19] <Mehrdad> what does fn[] do?
[02:40:30] <FrameFever> I need to get the hover color of a css class, how can I get this?
[02:42:52] <FrameFever> anybody awake?
[02:43:09] <OverL> hi guys, i have a problem, i use AJAX, but when i click 1st time jquery send 1 request, when i click 2nd time jquery send 2 requests etc.
[02:56:29] <anli__> $('#jquery').hello();
[02:58:36] <FrameFever> how can I get the hover color?
[02:59:41] <anli__> Why do you want that?
[02:59:43] <anli__> I dunno btw
[02:59:58] <anli__> But I would try foo.css(':hover'), probably without success
[03:00:23] <anli__> Well, that would not give a much btw
[03:01:19] <FrameFever> I need the color
[03:01:27] <anli__> How was it set?
[03:01:33] <FrameFever> via css
[03:01:43] <FrameFever> I want to read the data from the css style
[03:01:56] <FrameFever> so the user dont have to set them manually in via javascript
[03:02:09] <anli__> Add a class foo to the element and then, foo:hover { color: #f0f0f0; }
[03:02:15] <anli__> Then you can foo.hasClass()
[03:02:23] <anli__> oops
[03:02:33] <anli__> .foo:hover instead of foo:hover
[03:03:10] <anli__> foo is of course a word that should be changed to something better
[03:04:09] <FrameFever> what?
[03:04:23] <FrameFever> I have a style for a
[03:04:24] <dwarder_> is that possible  $('.a.c:last').remove(); ?
[03:04:31] <FrameFever> <a>
[03:04:54] <dwarder_> for <div class="a c">test</div>
[03:04:56] <FrameFever> and then I have something like a:hover {color : black;}
[03:04:59] <dwarder_> to remove
[03:05:15] <FrameFever> I need know this color from hover
[03:05:59] <csarmi> hello, is it the place to just ask things about jquery, even if it should be quite trivial?
[03:06:19] <dwarder> is that possible  $('.a.c:last').remove(); ?
[03:06:42] <dwarder> i.e. can i use :last with such class notation?
[03:09:21] <FrameFever> anli_: it doesnt work
[03:14:04] <dabear_> FrameFever: http://jsfiddle.net/Xm2zU/ I guess IE needs its own code though
[03:16:01] <FrameFever> dabear_: mhm without jquery
[03:16:06] <FrameFever> it works
[03:20:02] <FrameFever> dabear_: can I not user jquery for it?
[03:20:58] <dabear_> ?
[03:21:04] <dabear_> jquery is javascript
[03:22:31] <dabear_> you can always add a method $.getExternalStyle if you want :p
[03:22:37] <FrameFever> yea but its a lot of code
[03:22:53] <FrameFever> the think is, the a is styled under "#ImageSlider .descriptionTOP a:hover"
[03:23:16] <FrameFever> I dont know if I can use it with "rule.selectorText "
[03:23:44] <FrameFever> nevertheless I have alread the jquery link object
[03:24:04] <dabear_> you fail to realize that jquery is only javascript
[03:24:04] <FrameFever> so maybe I can start directly from this
[03:24:12] <dabear_> jquery cannot do it another way
[03:24:23] <FrameFever> I know its on top of the dom
[03:24:32] <dabear_> so if jquery had this feature it would look the same
[03:25:28] <dabear_> http://jsfiddle.net/Xm2zU/2/
[03:25:31] <dabear_> still works
[03:25:50] <dabear_> what I'm saying: a) take the code and use it
[03:25:52] <dabear_> or
[03:26:00] <dabear_> b) find another way to do what you want
[03:26:48] <FrameFever> I want to fit in this code with jquery
[03:27:07] <FrameFever> so i can use jquery's find mehods
[03:27:17] <FrameFever> this will replace all your for loops
[03:27:33] <dabear_> not possible
[03:27:36] <FrameFever> and then I can use this rule.selectorText
[03:27:42] <dabear_> you could use .each but that would not gain anything
[03:27:57] <FrameFever> that is the question, why Is it not possible?
[03:28:17] <FrameFever> because its not implemented...
[03:28:26] <dabear_> JQUERY DOES NOT HAVE ANY WAY to fetch a hover style
[03:28:42] <dabear_> the only way is to query the stylesheet objects them selves
[03:30:13] <dabear_> if you wanna hack it, you can do it like this guy: http://www.roslindesign.com/2011/05/04/detecting-the-hover-css-selector-style-in-jqueryjavascript/
[03:30:24] <dabear_> would require the user hovering the element though
[03:31:31] <FrameFever> i tryed it, dont work
[03:31:37] <FrameFever> I cant emit a hover event
[03:31:42] <FrameFever> dont know why
[03:31:51] <FrameFever> I mean I can emit the hover event
[03:32:03] <FrameFever> but when I trying to retrieve the color, I get the normal color
[03:33:31] <FrameFever> interesting I printed all rule in your loop, but this special one, doesnt show up
[03:33:34] <FrameFever> crazy
[03:33:50] <FrameFever> so on my site
[03:36:15] <FrameFever> dabear_: what do you think, can be the problem?
[03:36:30] <dabear_> pebkac is the problem, yes
[03:37:32] <dabear_> http://jsfiddle.net/Xm2zU/3/ to view all rules in the console
[03:39:20] <muzone> At this "cycle images on hover" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/ - why does text-align: center; only work for the first image?
[03:44:39] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/hN2A2/3/ can anyone take a look, counter doesn't show the real number of items that were added
[03:45:25] <FrameFever> dabear_: here a real test case http://jsfiddle.net/Xm2zU/4/
[03:45:55] <FrameFever> cant get the color
[03:46:17] <dwarder> only when i remove item
[03:46:26] <muzone> dwarder: thats some very ugly js :(
[03:46:40] <dwarder> muzone: thanks
[03:46:47] <muzone> sorry i know thats probably not helpful
[03:47:39] <muzone> hehe
[03:47:44] * muzone passes dwarder some weed
[03:48:05] <muzone> time to start over, start fresh
[03:48:09] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[03:48:37] * mehrdad hates js
[03:49:31] <mehrdad> and windows 8 has a big emphasis on js , :|
[03:49:43] <muzone> mehrdad: when is windows 8 coming out?
[03:50:04] <mehrdad> the consumer beta is said to be coming out on feb 29
[03:50:53] <aqeel> well how to achieve this......id...mouse over show, mouse out hide, if click==true  {show && mouse out show} else hide
[03:50:54] <dabear_> FrameFever: I see an alert box with a color
[03:51:02] <muzone> mehrdad: cool
[03:51:47] <aqeel> mouse out is conflicting with click == true
[03:51:48] <FrameFever> dabear_ : nope not there, latest FF
[03:51:50] <mehrdad> there's a lengthy blog post at on msdn about the ARM version
[03:52:25] <mehrdad> on msdn*
[03:52:55] <dabear_> FrameFever: Do I really need to fownload ff now? :(
[03:53:16] <FrameFever> I tested also with chrome 16.01
[03:53:37] <FrameFever> what do you use?
[03:54:38] <FrameFever> dabear_: what do you use?
[03:54:53] <dabear_> chrome 19 dev
[03:54:55] <mehrdad> muzone, can u explain to me how does this code work?
[03:54:55] <mehrdad> http://pastebin.com/57MLYmEb
[03:55:01] <mehrdad> it is driving me nuts
[03:55:19] <mehrdad> it is mainly about line 3
[03:55:34] <mehrdad> i searched the base jquery lib for datetimepicker
[03:56:03] <mehrdad> and all there was, could be found in jquery.ui lib
[03:56:13] <mehrdad> a single function with that name
[03:56:27] <mehrdad> but i thought it is calling a widget object
[03:56:38] <mehrdad> i dont understand how it works
[03:57:11] <mehrdad> let me put the related function in the jquery.ui lib in the paste as well
[03:57:59] <muzone> mehrdad: no idea man.. what you trying to do?
[03:58:35] <Znow> Im searching for how to use tabs from jquery ui, but not with container divs as the href, but pages.. I'm implementing it in wordpress, and having a hard time since tabs example is with <div id="tab-1">, anyone know a solution?
[03:58:47] <mehrdad> here http://pastebin.com/ze4X8RWd
[03:59:02] <cheshair> Hi! I need a voting system like the ones at reddit and stackoverflow. I want a thumb up and a thumb down icon, which will be grayed out until the user place his/her own vote. Is out there any jQuery widget I can use?
[03:59:33] <mehrdad> muzone, i am trying to imitate that code to create a map picker like a datetimepicker, using openlayers and mapquery
[04:00:02] <muzone> mehrdad: respect man!!
[04:00:14] <mehrdad> can u tell me how the code works
[04:00:16] <mehrdad> thx
[04:00:22] <mehrdad> the latter link
[04:01:04] <aqeel> if ($("#mm").click == true )
[04:01:14] <aqeel> is this valid?
[04:01:22] <mehrdad> i am mainly talking about line 3
[04:01:29] <FrameFever> dabear_: maybe it dont work with classes
[04:01:33] <mehrdad> in relation to the function at the end of the code
[04:01:38] <dabear_> FrameFever: indeed, hover rules do not show up in firefox
[04:02:55] <dwarder> can anyone take a look http://jsfiddle.net/hN2A2/4/ , removing items doesn't seem to work
[04:03:12] <dwarder> properly
[04:03:21] <dwarder> it removes two items at the time
[04:03:56] <dwarder> instead of one
[04:03:59] <dwarder> why?
[04:08:07] <mehrdad> muzone, will you buy a Windows 8 tablet?
[04:11:47] <muzone> mehrdad: im fine with my macbook + win7 for now
[04:12:00] <muzone> mehrdad: gotta use it to get rich before i start buying this and that
[04:13:56] <mehrdad> i hate the macbook touchpad
[04:14:18] <mehrdad> so freaking awkward, i can't effin drag around
[04:14:46] <mehrdad> i had to use my friend's to get some stuff done
[04:14:55] <mehrdad> and boy was it a pain :|
[04:18:54] <OverL> Hi guys, i have a problem, i use AJAX and when i click on button 1st time so jquery send 1 request, when i click on button 2nd time so jquery send 2 requests etc.
[04:19:32] <muzone> mehrdad: fuck
[04:19:43] <muzone> mehrdad: my shoulder and neck is completely destroyed because of it
[04:19:47] <muzone> lol
[04:20:18] <_superman> cannot join #java (channel is invite only)
[04:20:24] <_superman> :/
[04:21:28] <_superman> why java main method is static?
[04:22:43] <dwarder> _superman: you need to register you nick name on freenode
[04:23:10] <dwarder> _superman: and you probably need #javascript
[04:34:48] <mehrdad> anyone know what does fn[] do?
[04:35:03] <mehrdad> it creates a function? gets a function?
[05:06:42] <dwarder> mehrdad: array
[05:10:26] <mehrdad> dwarder, yeah it is, an array of functions
[05:10:57] <mehrdad> it certainly is not unclear that's an array
[05:11:33] <mehrdad> the way it is working is strange to me
[05:11:45] <mehrdad> an array of functions names
[05:16:09] <mehrdad> is there a map widget like a datepicker?
[05:34:52] <muzone> At this "cycle images on hover" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/9/ - does anybody know how to keep the images centered when hovering?
[05:35:07] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to MODIFY a core jquery function/definition (ie $.fn.load, in my case) so I can add some extra defaults to it? (in my case, passing the container's id, so PHP knows the context)
[05:36:23] <mehrdad> yo
[05:36:44] <mehrdad> s1n4, ask me :|
[05:37:32] <mehrdad> wtf
[05:37:37] <s1n4> hey, I wanna separate my numbers, how can I use number formater for all digits that are in a web page ?
[05:37:52] <mehrdad> yo
[05:39:18] <s1n4> helllooooo
[05:39:24] <s1n4> anyone alive ?

[05:41:03] <s1n4> :D
[05:41:30] <mehrdad> wait on, somebody will answer
[05:41:33] <s1n4> HOW DO I USE THIS FUCKING JQUERY ?
[05:41:40] <K3|Chris> ...
[05:41:47] <K3|Chris> shouting won't get you help
[05:41:52] <K3|Chris> this isn't kindergarden
[05:41:56] <mehrdad> lol
[05:41:58] <s1n4> HAHAHA
[05:42:15] <mehrdad> s1n4, calm down, he can help you, right K3|Chris ?
[05:43:01] <carloescobar> Hey. Quick question, I want to animate a div (height) and when I click the div animate it back to it's previous state (or a set value, it's 50px anyway)
[05:43:10] <carloescobar> I have a jsfiddle up here http://jsfiddle.net/CkpdG/
[05:43:22] <s1n4> K3|Chris, I'm now at student, coz I passed the kindergarden
[05:43:42] <carloescobar> I understand that this isn't correct, and why, but this is my first time using jquery and I don't know how to stop and have an if-function
[05:43:43] <s1n4> school*
[05:44:18] <carloescobar> Oh, and I don't know JS either. :)
[05:45:17] <muzone> At this "cycle images on hover" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/9/ - does anybody know how to keep the images centered when hovering?
[05:45:20] <muzone> I tried http://reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/ with disastrous consequences: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/10/
[05:46:03] <carloescobar> Do I want to check if the height is set to 150 (new value) and if so change or do I want to use .toggle?
[05:46:32] <carloescobar> or am I just waaaay out?
[05:48:45] <cheshair> Hi! I have a <ul>xyz</ul> node and want to replace xyz with another html block. How can I do that?
[05:49:50] <K3|Chris> carloescobar: http://jsfiddle.net/CkpdG/2/
[05:50:05] <carloescobar> Thank you sir.
[05:50:11] <K3|Chris> np
[05:51:01] <K3|Chris> the callback function on animation is optional btw
[05:51:11] <K3|Chris> if you don't need it, no need to put it in the code
[05:51:37] <Zogot> carloescobar: a little late http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/B43Rq/1/
[05:51:38] <carloescobar> Cool, thanks.
[05:51:42] <Zogot> exactly the same as Chris
[05:51:56] <Zogot> Just saw chris has sent you :)
[05:52:03] <carloescobar> Yeah, same result but different code.
[05:52:16] <carloescobar> Which would be the "right" way to do it?
[05:52:28] <carloescobar> Not that it really matters, just interested
[05:52:52] <Zogot> I would say loading the div into a variable, and referencing the variable is a practice you want to try and learn :)
[05:52:59] <Zogot> Not that theres anything wrong with Chris by any means
[05:54:17] <carloescobar> Ok
[05:54:23] <K3|Chris> agreed
[05:54:29] <carloescobar> You guys have been most helpful, thanks.
[05:54:43] <K3|Chris> Zogot: mostly for performance reasons I guess? using a selector multiple times is less efficient than just storing it as a variable?
[05:54:54] <Zogot> Yeh that was my understanding of it
[05:55:35] <Zogot> Also depends if theres more he wants to do, I've started to really fall in love writting JS the Object Literal way
[05:55:35] <carloescobar> Makes sense
[05:55:52] <carloescobar> In this case that was it
[05:56:29] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/fw7wt/
[05:56:37] <Zogot> an example of my object literal
[05:56:56] <BinaryKitten> whilst Zogot's code is indeed a step forward, if possible, you should prefix static items like that outside the event binding
[05:57:15] <BinaryKitten> in ref to: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/B43Rq/1/
[05:57:57] <Zogot> Wouldn't it be better to not put in the global with it if its only used inside the click element?
[05:58:20] <BinaryKitten> i'm not talking about putting it in global either
[05:59:28] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/B43Rq/2/
[06:00:10] <Zogot> Any but if hes gonna start doing anonymous functions, hes better off, i think, learning Object Literal, and doing readying on places like jqfundamentals
[06:00:14] <Zogot> about structure :)
[06:00:36] <Zogot> reading* not readying lol
[06:02:34] <BinaryKitten> Object Literal, for me is bad. If this was pure JS then fine, but jQuery doesn't lend itself to the Object Literal ideal properly unless you have a complete grasp on all the components.
[06:03:09] <BinaryKitten> further to the last pastebin, there were a couple of other issues too..   ie checking css height, setting height to a px value etc..
[06:03:29] <BinaryKitten> this should be the cleanest, almost most performant code: http://jsfiddle.net/B43Rq/3/
[06:04:47] <p2paul> Hello, I'm having a bit of a problem looping through a JSON object. I'm using something like this:  for(index++){for(key in data){  eval("data["+index+"]."+key) }}  -- any suggestions?
[06:04:49] <Zogot> Im by no stretch of the imagination a proffesional, or possibly an intermediate, so dont take my questions as a childish question or so, I too am also really interested :)
[06:05:23] <p2paul> the problem is performance, obviously
[06:05:40] <BinaryKitten> sorry Zogot i really dislike things like that it requires extra code like calling X from within the doc ready .. i react badly to it..
[06:06:15] <BinaryKitten> p2paul lets take a step back and ask what you are trying to achieve there
[06:06:32] <p2paul> got a load of data i need to store in an array to average
[06:06:43] <p2paul> or graph, etc
[06:06:48] <BinaryKitten> ok
[06:06:53] <p2paul> the eval is killin me
[06:07:04] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin the start format for me please?
[06:07:12] <p2paul> sure
[06:07:13] <BinaryKitten> and also the end format
[06:07:44] <p2paul> is basically an issue of dynamically accessing an object inside an array
[06:07:49] <p2paul> eval seemed the only way to do it
[06:07:55] <p2paul> paste coming up
[06:08:11] <BinaryKitten> thanks, i have a theory that this can be solved with a $.map
[06:08:23] <BinaryKitten> but until the data is there, i can't say for certain
[06:10:52] <p2paul> pastebin.com/YsFsakan   <--- that * 20  or so
[06:12:00] <mehrdad> yo s1
[06:12:04] * BinaryKitten is lazy, please next time include the http:// :p
[06:12:28] * s1n4 is crying D;
[06:12:36] <carloescobar> The div I'm calling $('#annet') doesn't have to be defined in the css right?
[06:13:03] <BinaryKitten> carloescobar nope as long as the div has the id set in the html at the time of loading
[06:13:11] <BinaryKitten> (well to some degree)
[06:13:28] <s1n4> hey guys, how can I use number formatter for separate all digits that are in a web page ?
[06:14:03] <carloescobar> so I put the script in after the html?
[06:14:16] <s1n4> pleeeeeease, somebody help me
[06:14:20] <BinaryKitten> carloescobar that's what document ready is for
[06:14:46] <carloescobar> Thanks, you just saved me a good hour of cursing at my screen.
[06:14:50] <carloescobar> Works like a charm now.
[06:14:54] <BinaryKitten> p2paul do you have a desired output?
[06:15:26] <p2paul> I'm flexible, just need all the data
[06:15:47] <BinaryKitten> well you have all the data
[06:15:51] <BinaryKitten> in that json
[06:16:03] <BinaryKitten> is that a json file? or a response?
[06:16:25] <p2paul> i need to make that json data availble to a browser
[06:16:36] <BinaryKitten> ok where is that json data currently?
[06:17:03] <p2paul> it's designed to work on the same local network, so ping shouldnt be an issue
[06:17:44] <BinaryKitten> not the question
[06:17:47] <p2paul> local server so to say
[06:17:57] <BinaryKitten> where is the json data in relation to the web app
[06:18:08] <p2paul> i got the json with an $.ajax(url  call
[06:18:12] <BinaryKitten> ok
[06:18:26] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin that $.ajax call please?
[06:20:16] <p2paul> pastebin.com/GTM2PR1E
[06:20:52] * BinaryKitten grudgingly copies/pastes the url that has no http :p
[06:21:10] <p2paul> same here -- have to type everything out :P
[06:21:18] <p2paul> err
[06:21:24] <p2paul> derp
[06:25:02] <BinaryKitten> p2paul working on something.. two ticks
[06:25:13] <p2paul> im patient :)
[06:26:11] <BinaryKitten> i'm guessing the data is [{item},{item}] ?
[06:26:25] <p2paul> plus one more sub-level
[06:26:34] <fallenstorm> hello, i use method jquery.post and receive redirect page. Can i manage it here or should i use jquery.ajax instead?
[06:26:38] <p2paul> the encasing array is what makes it difficult
[06:27:13] <p2paul> if it were all an array  x[0][0] would work
[06:28:17] <BinaryKitten> your eval doesn't make considerations for local_hash_rates and stale_shares_breakdown
[06:28:58] <p2paul> not yet, I hit the performance wall with the eval and stopped
[06:29:06] <BinaryKitten> trying to figure out the best way to process this...
[06:29:07] <BinaryKitten> ah ok
[06:29:13] * BinaryKitten has a plan!
[06:31:04] <p2paul> if there were a way to store the string in key as an object reference... :/
[06:31:46] <Darsain> any math guy? I need a math function with progress like this: http://snaps.darsa.in/s/f7dngm.png
[06:33:30] <muzone> At this "cycle images on hover" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/9/ - how do I keep the images centered when hovering? They are centered by default (inside their parent ULs), but once you hover them they get aligned to the left. How do I stop that?
[06:33:34] <muzone> I tried http://reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/ but with disastrous consequences: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/6FkhA/10/
[06:37:16] <p2paul> Darsain: looks like a tangent function
[06:39:28] <p2paul> or y=cot(x)
[06:40:04] <fallenstorm> What manager should i use in jquery.ajax to manage the redirect answer?
[06:42:58] <io__> hi is this properly written? >> $('.active').css('color', $(this).css('color'));
[06:47:54] <p2paul> BinaryKitten: I suppose the best way will be to have the server send _1, _2, _3  instead of an array
[06:48:25] <BinaryKitten> p2paul actually probably wouldn't
[06:48:33] <BinaryKitten> i'm close to a solution for you
[06:48:44] <BinaryKitten> my machine is slow at the moment due to a heavy update
[06:50:35] <maxx87guy> hey....anyone can help me to create a jquery chat?
[06:54:04] <fallenstorm> What manager should i use in jquery.ajax to manage the redirect answer?
[06:54:23] <fallenstorm> it works on "error" tag
[07:00:17] <BinaryKitten> p2paul still about?
[07:00:24] <p2paul> yup
[07:00:45] <s1n4> hey, how can I separate my numbers after selecting with class selector ?

[07:03:01] <Zogot> BinaryKitten: How would you set up large JS
[07:03:19] <BinaryKitten> Zogot define large Js?
[07:03:51] <Zogot> Well, Something that has lots of components.  Submitting a few forms, animation of tabs, modal boxes, google maps
[07:04:03] <Zogot> Is an example of a large JS file I had, that I seperated with Object Literal
[07:04:19] <Zogot> But I would love to know if theres something I'm missing, or a better way or so :)?
[07:05:48] <p2paul> BinaryKitten: thanks alot, I'll need a bit to think it over :) you have a bc address?
[07:06:22] <BinaryKitten> bc?

[07:21:49] <ziyadb> how deep can I nest child selectors?
[07:21:58] <ziyadb> e.g. is var $sixes = $("article > div > div > div > div > div >  p"); valid?
[07:22:17] <BinaryKitten> urm
[07:22:34] <BinaryKitten> can you not give the p a class or an id?
[07:23:14] <BinaryKitten> p in the 1st div inside the 1st div inside the 1st div inside the 1st div inside the 1st div inside an article tag
[07:23:22] <BinaryKitten> that's nasty selector no matter what
[07:23:44] <ericandrewlewis> preferred photo sliders / galleries: go
[07:23:46] <ziyadb> I cannot assign IDs, no. I need to process an existing document.
[07:24:08] <BinaryKitten> do any of the divs have a class or Id?
[07:24:21] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: any suggestions as to how I can address this? I'm trying to count the occurrences of p in each depth.
[07:24:30] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: nope. Code + document, http://jsfiddle.net/Q2Ken/7/
[07:25:22] <BinaryKitten> ah i see..
[07:25:24] <BinaryKitten> :D
[07:29:34] <ziyadb> well? :)
[07:30:06] <BinaryKitten> well ..
[07:30:07] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/Q2Ken/10/
[07:30:33] <BinaryKitten> gives you an object with depth_x: Y  where y is the amount of p on that depth
[07:32:29] <BinaryKitten> that work for you ziyadb?
[07:32:37] <ziyadb> about to test it.
[07:36:48] <BinaryKitten> well ?
[07:37:02] <ericandrewlewis> is lightbox defunct?
[07:37:12] <BinaryKitten> yes and no
[07:37:21] <BinaryKitten> the original item yes
[07:37:40] <BinaryKitten> variations, and extensions to the concept .. no
[07:38:01] <ericandrewlewis> heh right. well i guess i mean to ask what is the preferred replacement?
[07:38:19] <BinaryKitten> there isn't one, since a lot of them do different things
[07:38:33] <BinaryKitten> what feature set are you looking for?
[07:38:57] <ericandrewlewis> just a pop-in image viewer with slideshow capabilities
[07:40:26] <ericandrewlewis> fancybox looks like something i've seen a lot
[07:41:52] <BinaryKitten> ziyadb  well?
[07:42:03] <fallenstorm> i have a some text, how can i print it with Jquery?
[07:42:03] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: noobing out. More time.
[07:42:10] <fallenstorm> to printer
[07:42:16] <BinaryKitten> lol
[07:42:22] <BinaryKitten> fallenstorm you can't
[07:42:37] <BinaryKitten> you can tell the browser to offer to print
[07:42:49] <BinaryKitten> that's native javascript
[07:42:53] <fallenstorm> ok
[07:43:05] <BinaryKitten> but you can't actually print directly, that would be a breach of browser security
[07:43:19] <ericandrewlewis> eesh but fancybox two is under a non commercial license, ew
[07:44:03] <BinaryKitten> ericandrewlewis so you're after a lightbox replacement that is licensed in a way that allows you to used it appropriately
[07:44:11] <ericandrewlewis> yep
[07:44:20] <BinaryKitten> which license is fancybox 2 under?
[07:44:49] <ericandrewlewis> Creative Commons attribution - non commercial
[07:45:21] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: yup, got it working.
[07:45:23] <ericandrewlewis> i'm writing a WP plugin so anything like that won't work
[07:45:34] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: now let's see if I'll get the results I want :) Thank you!
[07:46:19] <BinaryKitten> ziyadb actually, i have improvements
[07:47:20] <ericandrewlewis> strange, but fancybox 1 is under the MIT license
[07:47:46] <ericandrewlewis> seems like the developer is going commercial with 2.0
[07:48:25] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: lay them on me.
[07:48:29] <BinaryKitten> ziyadb http://jsfiddle.net/Q2Ken/11/
[07:49:15] <BinaryKitten> switched out so that it has a startDepth that way no matter where in the document the starting point article is it shoul calculate properly
[07:49:23] <BinaryKitten> are there going to be multiple articles?
[07:51:43] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: well, it isn't really for production. I'm just writing it in an attempt to improve my mastery of the DOM.
[07:52:15] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: and I had originally set out to write it in pure JS, but a friend wrote a better version in Jquery, so now, I'm making an effort to know it better.
[07:52:26] <BinaryKitten> ok
[07:52:29] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: so, no. There is just that article that I'm playing with. :)
[07:52:55] <BinaryKitten> ok, if there were multiple, there would need to be other code to take that into consideration
[07:53:02] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: thanks for your assistance, I'll idle around, read some more of the Jquery docs, and see if I fully understand what you wrote :)
[07:53:03] * BinaryKitten waves across the penines to BarryCarlyon
[07:53:24] <ziyadb> well, it's very straightforward, just not familiar with the $() syntax.
[07:53:27] * BarryCarlyon waves back
[07:53:33] * ziyadb waves too.
[07:53:41] * BarryCarlyon explodes
[07:53:44] <BinaryKitten> ziyadb for your information, .lenth is native js for objects/arrays
[07:54:00] <BinaryKitten> hows the weather over there BarryCarlyon?
[07:54:08] <BarryCarlyon> Cold.
[07:54:13] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: yes, it caused me to run into a few type errors :)
[07:54:14] <BarryCarlyon> But clear.

[07:55:50] <tbenedyk> anyone here any good with rails and jquery?
[07:56:06] <tbenedyk> i cant seem to get the latest parameters into my jquery logic
[07:59:01] <tbenedyk> $(this).parent().replaceWith('<%= escape_javascript(render(:partial => "wizards/brand", :locals => {:brand_id => params[:brand_id]} )) %>');.... the partial will work once, but will continue rendering the partial with the first brand_id, i need the brand_id to update each time
[08:01:15] <BinaryKitten> ziyadb more for you to churn over http://jsfiddle.net/Q2Ken/12/
[08:01:29] <BinaryKitten> that gets you an array of objects, 1 object per article..
[08:01:32] <BinaryKitten> just in case
[08:01:44] <LukeNukem> http://jsfiddle.net/aMdWh/1/
[08:01:45] <LukeNukem> Hi
[08:01:55] <ziyadb> BinaryKitten: thank you! I appreciate it.
[08:02:06] <LukeNukem> can somebody please take a look at that? i want it to figure out the id of the status update using data-id when the like button is clicked
[08:02:17] <LukeNukem> i tried defining a var to the data id but when i alert it, i get undefined
[08:02:20] <LukeNukem> please someone
[08:03:32] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem look at what?
[08:03:41] <BinaryKitten> ah i see it
[08:04:07] <LukeNukem> so i need to know the id of the status update to work with php, ive done that using data-id but i cant define a variable to it
[08:04:12] <LukeNukem> to use with ajax
[08:04:36] <Nomikos> Pro-tip: include jQuery with the menu on the left
[08:06:05] <LukeNukem> so BinaryKitten can you help me out :(
[08:06:47] <BinaryKitten> trying to
[08:06:50] <fallenstorm> BinaryKitten i recieve some page with jquery.ajax(post) and it redirects me to some context i want to print
[08:06:58] <BinaryKitten> i really don't like the hovery stuff
[08:07:07] <fallenstorm> but i reciece it only in text
[08:07:13] <fallenstorm> and i need html
[08:07:16] <BinaryKitten> fallenstorm ask the channel not me
[08:07:17] <LukeNukem> fallenstorm, use the success:
[08:07:18] <LukeNukem> thignei
[08:07:21] <LukeNukem> thingie*
[08:07:31] * BinaryKitten is currently helping (attempting to) LukeNukem
[08:07:41] * LukeNukem Appreciates it
[08:07:43] <fallenstorm> BinaryKitten sorry, from last message remain =)
[08:08:22] <Nomikos> LukeNukem: you can get the data-id of the clicked element with $(this).data('id'), in the click handler - but you've set up one handler for all the different elements?
[08:08:44] <fallenstorm> LukeNukem succes doesnt work when redirecting
[08:08:45] <LukeNukem> yeah to know which element is clicked
[08:08:56] <LukeNukem> fallenstorm, what are you trying to do actually
[08:09:08] <Nomikos> Why not create seperate handlers for each type of button?
[08:09:46] <astacy> is there a way to run QUnit tests synchronously?
[08:09:56] <astacy> specifically asyncTest()
[08:10:05] <LukeNukem> idk, a friend wrote that for me, now its upto me to do the rest of the stuff
[08:11:36] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem, Nomikos it works well.. and it's nice code .. but it is a head banger..
[08:11:43] <LukeNukem> yeah
[08:12:04] <Nomikos> I would approach it a tad differently :/
[08:12:41] <fallenstorm> LukeNukem callback complete or error return this http://pastie.org/3367783, so i want to print responseText is html-page
[08:13:44] <fallenstorm> s/is/as/
[08:13:47] <LukeNukem> so BinaryKitten how would i get the data-id to work
[08:14:22] <Nomikos> var targ=$(e.target); //figure out which element was clicked  --> $(this) would have worked here
[08:14:41] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem  just before hsh=    add                         var id=targ.data('id');
[08:15:27] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem personally i wouldn't have data-id on all the links
[08:15:41] <BinaryKitten> I would have it on the .statusUpdate item
[08:16:11] <Nomikos> And I would use classes instead of href='#foo' to specify the type of button
[08:16:38] <BinaryKitten> Nomikos the hash could be used elsewhere in application for placeholding etc
[08:16:43] <Nomikos> then you can just have separate $('.foo').click( do stuff )'s for each button
[08:16:51] <Nomikos> True, still.
[08:17:36] <BinaryKitten> if you moved the data-id, then you would need to var id=upd.data('id'); instead LukeNukem
[08:19:52] <LukeNukem> BinaryKitten, before hsh= ? what line?
[08:20:33] <BinaryKitten> i don't have line numbers, i just closed the page
[08:20:51] <LukeNukem> var hsh=e.target.hash;
[08:20:53] <LukeNukem> is that the one?
[08:20:55] <BinaryKitten> yep
[08:20:59] <BinaryKitten> before that
[08:21:08] <BinaryKitten> then you can use it instead of idx
[08:21:34] <LukeNukem> WOW I LOVE YOU
[08:21:35] <LukeNukem> NO HOMO
[08:21:56] <LukeNukem> also what do you mean by having it on the .statusUpdate item
[08:21:58] <LukeNukem> how would i do that
[08:28:10] <BinaryKitten> well i don't know how you would go about adding the item in your php
[08:28:22] <BinaryKitten> (or whatever generates the html output)
[08:28:40] <BinaryKitten> but move the bit that puts data-id="x" to the item that has the class statusUpdate
[08:28:48] <LukeNukem> id do an ajax request
[08:28:57] <LukeNukem> url : "test.php?id="+id
[08:29:05] <BinaryKitten> then use  var id=upd.data('id');
[08:29:51] <BinaryKitten> and LukeNukem I would never have though you were expressing homosexual thoughts, until you said no homo
[08:29:55] <emx> which event is triggered when the background image of an element has loaded?
[08:30:04] * BinaryKitten = girl anyways.. not that it matters
[08:30:24] <BinaryKitten> emx background-image as in css?
[08:30:32] <emx> BinaryKitten, yes
[08:31:01] <BinaryKitten> emx there isn't one
[08:31:10] <emx> BinaryKitten, thought so. thanks
[08:31:12] <BinaryKitten> css is applied by the browser, it doesn't have events
[08:31:29] <BinaryKitten> what you can do is attempt to preload the image, and handle the load on that
[08:31:46] <emx> BinaryKitten, i guess that's the only workaround
[08:31:48] <BinaryKitten> then apply that image as background-image to the target
[08:36:35] <LukeNukem> BinaryKitten, where should i use var id=upd.data('id');
[08:36:57] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem congrats on failing the stupidity test <re unrequested privmsgs>
[08:37:11] <BinaryKitten> LukeNukem help has been terminated
[08:42:42] <io__> hi I was trying to use jquery to change css element of my page, that s quite easy but how to get permanent changes to the page?
[08:43:15] <Nomikos> define permanent?
[08:43:27] <Nomikos> it's a web page, it's not saved anywhere on the client permanently
[08:44:05] <ciro_nunes> io__: you can save changes using client-side browser storage
[08:44:30] <ciro_nunes> io__: look for localStorage
[08:44:52] <io__> ciro_nunes: i am using Drupal so I may go just for a theme switcher but if i can store the changes somehow in jquery, that owuld be something new to larn
[08:45:01] <io__> ok
[08:45:25] <abjorn> Oh God, Netflix just suggested a movie called "Hobo with a Shotgun" to me. I've got to watch this.
[08:45:27] * Nomikos votes theme switcher
[08:45:29] <emx> io__, are you aware of that your changes would affect your client only?
[08:46:27] <Nomikos> abjorn: it's as bad as it sounds :-) watch Planet Terror after
[08:46:28] <ciro_nunes> io__: I don't understand what you want
[08:46:44] <abjorn> Oh I don't doubt it.
[08:49:27] <io__> ciro_nunes: change some css and make it permanent at least for the session
[08:49:47] <io__> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jstore/ but probably theme switching is way easier
[08:51:42] <cheshair__> please, i need help with this: http://dpaste.com/702012/ i get a "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }" error and can't debug it. Any idea?
[08:51:56] <ciro_nunes> io__: hmm
[08:53:47] <BinaryKitten> cheshair__ add a line between 24/25
[08:53:49] <BinaryKitten> with a }
[08:54:07] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, i'll check it out right away
[08:54:19] * BinaryKitten recommends a lint
[08:55:23] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, are you sure?
[08:55:33] <Nomikos> try a ; after the ) on 26
[08:55:45] <dabear_> http://www.jshint.com/
[08:56:51] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, Nomikos: thank you very much but no way
[08:56:57] <cheshair__> it doesn't work
[08:57:16] <Nomikos> hrm, local jslint returns fine with the ; (not the extra })
[08:58:32] <cheshair__> Nomikos, I am having problems when the function is called the second time (and following)
[08:58:37] <Nomikos> is there an online jslint'r which only checks *syntax* ?
[08:59:06] <BinaryKitten> cheshair__ that's a different issue though
[08:59:43] <BinaryKitten> can't expect us to fix an issue we've no knowledge of
[09:00:05] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, how can I help you in helping me?
[09:00:34] <Nomikos> cheshair__: what is the error you get the second time?
[09:00:37] <BinaryKitten> ?peace @ cheshair__
[09:00:38] <bot-t> cheshair__, please Pastebin: Expected result, Actual result, all (relevant) Code, any Errors/Exceptions - This is *not* a multiple-choice request, we need all of them
[09:00:51] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, that's not a different issue: the error I get is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }" and I get it from the second call of the function onward
[09:01:26] <cheshair__> Nomikos, the error I get is the one I indicated
[09:01:49] <Nomikos> cheshair__: you're inserting {{ STATIC_URL }} into html, which is then run onclick() - is that a serverside tag replacement?
[09:02:03] <Nomikos> I suspect the issue is with those
[09:02:25] <cheshair__> Nomikos, yep that's a Django template tag and is correctly substituted by the server
[09:02:48] <BinaryKitten> the line follow on
[09:02:59] <cheshair__> Nomikos, i think the problem is with the replaceWith long html strings
[09:03:15] * Nomikos nods
[09:03:18] <BinaryKitten> cheshair__ i've seen longer than that
[09:03:45] <BinaryKitten> cheshair__ have you checked the \ bits in those strings?
[09:03:49] <Nomikos> or you mean the linebreaks in the strings?
[09:04:06] <BinaryKitten> yep the ones that break the template tags
[09:04:15] <BinaryKitten> eg {{ S \
[09:04:44] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, hm... i don't get you here
[09:04:50] <BinaryKitten> if the usual case with template tags, it can't replace if it's not valid, and that would leave extra stuff
[09:05:10] <BinaryKitten> end of lines 10, 14 and 18
[09:05:22] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, thanks I'll check it out
[09:05:35] <BinaryKitten> the template tags are multiple lines, this may cause an  issue ... i don't know
[09:05:51] <BinaryKitten> since we're not seeing the actual output html
[09:06:20] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, ah I see! hm no... that's only my (wrong) cut and paste from my emacs editor
[09:06:58] <Nomikos> cheshair__: is this online somewhere?
[09:07:20] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, Nomikos: you have been very kind and helpful, I'll take some time to tidy up things and paste on pastebin with more details
[09:07:24] <Nomikos> cheshair__: if it only goes wrong the second time around, the error is likely in the new JS code inserted in the page
[09:09:10] <cheshair__> Nomikos, hm sounds right
[09:09:47] <chee> ls
[09:14:16] <hravula> hey
[09:17:11] <cheshair__> BinaryKitten, Nomikos: I managed to fix that!! Thank you so much!!
[09:18:01] <cheshair__> Nomikos, it was just as you said! the problem was in the js code i was adding to my html: I was not properly escaping " and '
[09:18:40] <Nomikos> rock :)
[09:18:42] <cheshair__> Nomikos, onclick=\'vote_act("' + act_id + '", "up");\'
[09:18:52] <cheshair__> Nomikos, :-)
[09:19:33] <gf3> also you have JS in your HTML...
[09:19:38] <gf3> JUST FYI, BRO
[09:20:00] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.
[09:21:21] <Whirl3d> I have a series of list items that contain form elements. I apply certain styles to the li that has a focused form element to indicate that it is "active". There should only be one "active" li at a time.
[09:22:08] <Whirl3d> Which is the best way to ensure that this happens? Do I check for other "active" items on focus? or disable "active" on blur?
[09:23:16] <gmad> Hello!
[09:23:42] <Whirl3d> and is it better to handle the transformations at the list items parent element or bind actions to each list item?
[09:23:48] <Whirl3d> Hello gmad.
[09:23:54] <Nomikos> Whirl3d: what I do is, on focus, removeClass('active') from all, then addClass() it to $(this). On blur, remove it again
[09:24:20] <Nomikos> (add .closest('li') in between there somewhere)
[09:24:47] <Nomikos> not sure if it's the best way, but thought I'd throw it out here in case someone says "I can do better!" :-p
[09:25:13] <Whirl3d> Nomikos, thanks for the reply. I do something similar, but always wondered if there was a better way to handle it.
[09:25:19] <Nomikos> Me too :)
[09:25:33] <gmad> I have question about JQuery BBQ. It's nice library. I've already implemented it my web page. I do not like only one: not so nice address in address bar, like my_page.php?id=7&something='data'. Is any way to mask params in address?
[09:26:07] <Whirl3d> gmad, what would you like to see in address?
[09:26:40] <gmad> I would like to see only domain. Like http://my_page.com/
[09:27:04] <gmad> or http://my_page.com/page.html
[09:27:35] <gmad> without "?param_1=1&param_2='something'
[09:27:51] <Whirl3d> then you are going to have to manage your page state separately and load your content via ajax or something...
[09:27:57] <Nomikos> google 'friendly url' ? I think this is more related to serverside
[09:28:12] <gmad> Nomikos: Yes
[09:28:38] <Nomikos> (disclaimer: I don't know anything about jQuery BBQ)
[09:29:14] <Nomikos> .. oh. the hash thing. I know nothing.
[09:29:26] <Whirl3d> well, the whole focus of jquery BBQ if I remember correctly is to allow you to use hashtags for navigation, specifically back and forward.
[09:31:21] <Whirl3d> so you could send http://mydomain.com#services and it would tell your page to load the services page (which without bbq would look like http://mydomain.com/services.html). It also manages the browser's "back" function
[09:31:39] <Whirl3d> Im grossly overexaggerating, but you get the idea.
[09:33:10] * Nomikos remembers when html was simple
[09:33:43] * Whirl3d remembers life before the internets
[09:34:00] <Nomikos> .. the *internet*, or the web?
[09:37:40] <ravenzz> Whirl3d have you ever heard about the focus pseudo-selector?
[09:39:13] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, yeah I use it a lot. Wasn't sure if it was good to use it or not.
[09:39:25] <ravenzz> do you need to style the form element's parent?
[09:40:02] <Whirl3d> In my li, I have collapsable (animated) instruction panels that slide up or down when a child element gets or loses focus
[09:40:29] <Whirl3d> so, I originally just styled the elements using the focus selector in CSS
[09:40:47] <Whirl3d> it worked great, but didn't have the bells and whistles that the client was looking for.
[09:41:25] <ravenzz> are these instruction panels after the form element?
[09:41:44] <ravenzz> eg <input type="text" name="foo"><p>details</p>
[09:41:58] <Whirl3d> yeah, basically.
[09:42:36] <ravenzz> oh you could rely on the css3 animations and the sibling css2 selector
[09:42:36] <Whirl3d> more like <li class='formField'><input name='foo'/><div class='infoPanel'><p class='instr">instructions</p></div></li>
[09:42:49] <ravenzz> yep same story
[09:43:06] <Whirl3d> css3 animations? sounds delightful.
[09:43:21] <Whirl3d> do you have a reputable link I could study?
[09:43:37] <ravenzz> s/animations/transitions
[09:43:47] <Whirl3d> I can google it, but who knows what to believe. Your advice would help sort throught the mess
[09:49:49] <ravenzz> Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/B5tpK/
[09:50:19] <ravenzz> I don't know why the transition is not applyied to the height
[09:50:43] <ravenzz> oh ok
[09:50:57] <ravenzz> the transition doesn't work when you animate from 0 to auto
[09:51:06] <ravenzz> you should specify an height
[09:52:25] <Whirl3d> brilliant! I have never heard of such a thing. Does it fail over nicely?
[09:52:48] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, thanks for your generous and thoughtful help.
[09:53:06] <ravenzz> well it is CSS2
[09:53:17] <ravenzz> only the transition require a CSS3 compliant browser
[09:53:59] <ravenzz> you could use Modernizr to detect its support and provide a fallback for the *old* browsers
[09:57:48] <Whirl3d> so you use Modernizr?
[10:01:33] <ravenzz> if you like to play with the new browsers features and have the same effect in the old ones you should
[10:07:52] <Whirl3d> Aha! you missed the question...lol. Do YOU use it, personally?
[10:08:10] <avalarion_> I need help with the height of an Element... Why does jquery tell me that an ul Element with a defined with and li with display: inline and line-height: 70 is only 70px height? Even if there are 3 rows of my li Elements?
[10:08:36] <ravenzz> ah yes when it is needed
[10:10:07] <ravenzz> i tend to have the things working without js anyway. I mean, you should js when you need it
[10:10:13] <avalarion_> You can see my problem at: http://dev.foto.bbnetz.eu/portraits.html
[10:11:22] <rgoodwin> how to properly use jsfiddle if you have local resources? or just better to paste bin?
[10:13:01] <Nomikos> jsfiddle allows you to link to resources, but they have to be available online (it doesn't accept uploads afaik)
[10:13:09] <rgoodwin> right
[10:13:10] <rgoodwin> ok
[10:13:58] <rgoodwin> well let me stumble forth and see if i need it. i have learned how to replace content, but in my setInterval loop the content isn't changing every time. just once. probably me learning about JS
[10:15:25] <rgoodwin> nice. ripple just crashes and won't instlal
[10:18:30] <squeakytoy> Is it possible to loop through all elements in a page and is it wise?
[10:19:04] <Nomikos> yes; depends :)
[10:19:28] <Nomikos> what are you trying to do?
[10:19:48] <squeakytoy> im wonderinf if i should loop through all elements, and double check that all ids/names are unique
[10:20:56] <Nomikos> I'd throw it at http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input for the ids (I /think/ it should point 'm out), and just make sure it cannot happen of course
[10:21:25] <squeakytoy> i kinda what it on the fly
[10:21:41] <Nomikos> checking if your code is doing what it's supposed to, client-side after serving it, is .. sub-optimal, IMO
[10:22:46] <squeakytoy> well, i have the risk that some other developer might reuse a name/id on the page, without knowing about it :/
[10:23:43] <squeakytoy> hence, when the page load, an error can occur if a name/id is declared twice
[10:30:11] <Nomikos> squeakytoy: http://pastebin.com/pth8zYa8  (apply a liberal disclaimer as to any fitness for any purpose :-_
[10:30:14] <Nomikos> *:-)
[10:30:33] <Nomikos> oh, and prepend var ids = [];
[10:31:44] <squeakytoy> but maybe its stupid
[10:31:45] <squeakytoy> ?
[10:31:49] <squeakytoy> with those valiations
[10:31:56] <krz> how do i make this background image move?
[10:32:09] <krz> so it looks like an animated gif (progress bar)
[10:32:51] <Nomikos> squeakytoy: I'd make sure it never happened - you could add some code to test for it in the testing phase, but I wouldn't run it in production
[10:33:04] <squeakytoy> then ill ignore it
[10:33:18] <squeakytoy> sounds like i should focus on that it should never happen in the first place :-)
[10:33:44] <Nomikos> and tell the other devs to check for it, I guess
[10:33:45] <krz> anyone?
[10:34:03] <squeakytoy> krz: what is "this"?
[10:34:15] <krz> squeakytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/Gahze/
[10:35:24] <squeakytoy> krz: perhaps you can change the background css position
[10:35:28] <Nomikos> krz: replace the png by an animated gif?
[10:35:35] <squeakytoy> haha, yea
[10:36:49] <rgoodwin> ok i guess i need to use jsfiddle ;) is the phone gap file hosted anywhere?
[10:37:25] <Nomikos> krz: http://www.ajaxload.info/cache/FF/FF/FF/00/00/00/8-1.gif via http://www.ajaxload.info
[10:38:09] <krz> squeakytoy: yea thats what I'm looking for
[10:38:12] <krz> perhaps via js
[10:38:25] <krz> Nomikos: i know about that
[10:38:30] <krz> not what I'm looking for
[10:39:58] <Nomikos> krz: http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/#animated then?
[10:40:20] <krz> Nomikos: too fat
[10:40:39] <krz> don't wan tho use UI just for a loader
[10:42:18] <krz> $('#loader').css('background-position','8px 0px') works
[10:45:38] <rgoodwin> ok here's my dumb paste: http://jsfiddle.net/5RVjP/
[10:45:51] <rgoodwin> i have no idea why, at this point, my replaceWith isn't working
[10:47:23] <Whirl3d> do folks use SASS or Compass?
[10:48:03] <rgoodwin> from what little iknow is it makes doing things like variables etc possible in CSS
[10:48:07] <rgoodwin> but i do know very little :)
[10:49:16] <matthPHP> I use LESS sometimes but only in development
[10:50:21] <ccc> hello
[10:50:36] <ccc> a little help ?
[10:51:06] <ccc> anybody ?
[10:51:07] <ccc> there
[10:51:37] <ccc> hyyyy
[10:51:40] <ccc> anybody here
[10:51:42] <hzh> @rgoodwin, replaceWith should use with string
[10:52:25] <Nomikos> wtf
[11:43:42] <Vespakoen> Hey there! does anybody know a plugin that will return the input value, selected radiobutton, selected option from dropdown value ?
[11:43:57] <Vespakoen> without knowing what element i have?
[11:44:21] <john-dev> you could write in if/else statement :-/
[11:44:43] <Vespakoen> <select name="test"><option value="g">efwefwe</option></select> $('input[name=test]').selectedVal(); something like that
[11:45:19] <Vespakoen> hmzz, yeh, a plugin would be nice though, one that works with checkboxes and multiple selects would be even more awesome
[11:45:27] <john-dev> it's option:selected
[11:45:37] <Vespakoen> but I dont know what type the input is
[11:45:39] <john-dev> http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[11:45:56] <john-dev> you could check what you have.. don't know a plugin
[11:46:33] <Vespakoen> i guess i will write my own then =)
[11:46:53] <john-dev> probably.. just use .length and see if you receive 1 as resposne :)
[11:47:44] <Vespakoen> Ok let's see how far i get, Thanks for the help anyways!
[11:49:35] <squeakytoy> Hey all. I have this classic error that "this" gets lost, when im using events. How do i solve that now again?
[11:49:57] <bot-t> squeakytoy, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:11:15] <AIEmpire> Guys, when using jQuery.ajax( url, [ complete: somefunction()] ), what object gets passed to that function? The XML object?
[12:17:39] <umren_> any pro tips? https://gist.github.com/1804159 can't resolve this problem ;/ problem is printer in comment of gist
[12:24:03] <handibar> Anyone want to tell me what I've done wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/4/ (It's supposed to load with all the inner TR's hidden and clicking a TH shows the child TRs? I know tables are a sin, but I have a lot of legacy code dropping tables and people expecting to see tables so I work with tables.. :)
[12:25:01] <prometh> $("ul > li").eq(1).lots_of_stuff().end().more_stuff();   // will end().more_stuff() still recognize eq(1), or will it revert back to the "ul>li" ?
[12:26:57] <prometh> it sounds like it will ignore the .eq(1) .... how can i make it not do that?
[12:27:50] <brettfrable> hey
[12:27:57] <brettfrable> so i'm reading the jquery cookbook
[12:28:12] <brettfrable> and i'm a little confused as to why none of the code in the tutorials is working
[12:28:14] <brettfrable> for example
[12:28:14] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:29:13] <prometh> is the jquery chain FASTER or just "better" cuz things can be merged into 1 line of code?
[12:30:32] <victorche> hey, anyone familiar with zepto.js?
[12:31:53] <brettfrable> why doesnt this work
[12:31:54] <brettfrable> 		<script type="text/javascript">
[12:31:55] <brettfrable> 			//alert how many elements
[12:31:55] <brettfrable> 			$(document).ready(function(){
[12:31:55] <brettfrable> 			alert('Page contains ' + JQuery('a').length + ' <a> elements!');
[12:31:55] <brettfrable> 			});
[12:31:56] <brettfrable> 		</script>
[12:32:02] <rgoodwin> i would like to kiss whoever maintains jqmobile
[12:32:09] <rgoodwin> it is so freaking beautiful and easy
[12:32:26] <David_Bradbury> brettfrable: Please use a paste service to share code. Don't spam the channel
[12:32:26] <rgoodwin> or buy a beer, since I think it's someone named john? :)
[12:32:35] <brettfrable> okay
[12:32:37] <prometh> is the jquery chain FASTER or just "better" cuz things can be merged into 1 line of code?
[12:32:38] <brettfrable> sorry
[12:32:43] <brettfrable> well why doesnt that work
[12:34:12] <pifantastic> prometh: it's just a nicer API, it's not faster
[12:34:20] <prometh> cool, thank you
[12:34:21] <David_Bradbury> brettfrable: Use $('a')
[12:34:25] <David_Bradbury> not JQuery
[12:34:30] <brettfrable> Ugh
[12:34:36] <brettfrable> I'm reading the JQ cookbook
[12:34:42] <brettfrable> and it references JQuery
[12:34:45] <brettfrable> instead of $
[12:34:55] <brettfrable> I'm assuming it's outdated?
[12:34:56] <pifantastic> jQuery != JQuery
[12:34:59] <pifantastic> lowercase j
[12:35:12] <pifantastic> you are using JQuery, that's wrong, it's jQuery
[12:35:12] <David_Bradbury> Yup
[12:35:19] <David_Bradbury> Case is important
[12:35:34] <David_Bradbury> though just use $ - It is easier and doesn't lend itself to errors like that
[12:35:37] <David_Bradbury> Though*
[12:35:48] <victorche> anyone, who knows zepto.js?
[12:36:02] <David_Bradbury> I don't
[12:36:20] <squeakytoy> this event context switch and using $.proxy is a pain. Im on my second event, and i am lost
[12:37:07] <David_Bradbury> So, I'm wanting to grab the HTML of an element. I'd normally just do $("#p_3").html() - But I want the HTML of that tag surrounding the innerHTML as well
[12:37:18] <brettfrable> got it
[12:37:19] <brettfrable> thank you
[12:37:21] <David_Bradbury> How might I do that?
[12:37:23] <David_Bradbury> :)
[12:37:28] <David_Bradbury> Glad to hear brett
[12:38:01] <David_Bradbury> And I cannot just grab the parent element's innerHTML and grab that, as it would get lots of extra stuff I don't need
[12:40:29] <rgoodwin> hmm. with default mobile theme, it's "looking" for an images dir
[12:40:37] <rgoodwin> but my download didn't come with it
[12:40:42] <rgoodwin> or did i miss something
[12:41:01] <David_Bradbury> Aren't the images in jQuery Mobile embedded in base-64?
[12:41:26] <David_Bradbury> I could be wrong
[12:41:39] <rgoodwin> i just found a big "hey you idiot you probably want these files too" on the download page
[12:41:41] <rgoodwin> to paraphrase
[12:41:50] <David_Bradbury> Hah
[12:42:19] <rgoodwin> i just keep forgetting that the query docs aren't really specific to device builds
[12:42:26] <rgoodwin> i reference all things locally
[12:49:34] <rgoodwin> if you want something replaced before the page ever displays
[12:49:47] <rgoodwin> what's the proper way to do that? i have placeholder text that of course you see before anything happens
[12:49:57] <David_Bradbury> PHP :P
[12:49:57] <rgoodwin> i guess duh you put it in the ready() not in the phone gap ready
[12:50:24] <rgoodwin> lol
[12:50:29] <rgoodwin> this is a device build
[12:50:35] <David_Bradbury> I'm just teasing
[12:51:26] <rgoodwin> i guess i need to move all my recalculations etc into the DOM ready, and then just update them as needed later.
[12:51:26] <rgoodwin> t
[12:51:31] <rgoodwin> ethnically not even using phone gap at the moment
[12:51:43] <rgoodwin> or proper spelling
[12:51:58] <mutedia> ethnically, that's a new one
[12:55:19] <handibar> Anyone want to tell me what I've done wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/4/ (It's supposed to load with all the inner TR's hidden and clicking a TH shows the child TRs?) I'd even take a demo of how to move from showing spreadsheet data in tables to DIVs?
[13:03:43] <handibar> Wait.. Tables for data is still the standard? So I guess I need to use some child classes and a bit of code to make this work? http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/4/
[13:05:03] <Nomikos> handibar: find('th') [...] .next() -> that won't select the <tr>s I think
[13:05:32] <Nomikos> the th already sits in a tr, and has no siblings
[13:06:19] <handibar> Yeah I was just going to say.. looiking at the result with a DOM inspector I can see it's not a child.. Arrr..
[13:06:40] <Nomikos> if you add a .closest('tr') right before the .next() it /sorta/ works
[13:07:04] <handibar> Can you do an update with what you mean?
[13:07:30] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/5/ - it still doesn't work right, but it hides some trs now
[13:09:18] <handibar> Oh wow it went nuts.. Here's the thing though.. PHP is writing the table dynamically.. So I should be able to use the class or the ID of the child TRs? Let me load my lunch in the oven and update with an example.. (just learning here so I'm loving the help thanks)
[13:09:35] <nail_> .parent().nextUntil('tr:has(th)') ?
[13:11:05] <handibar> nail_: That looks brilliant.. but .. ? :)
[13:11:28] <Nomikos> find() already returns all the th elements
[13:11:44] <nail_> if your current position is the <th>, that will select all following <tr>s until the next header
[13:12:26] <Nomikos> ah, point
[13:13:29] <handibar> So that .parent vs. the .find?
[13:13:39] <handibar> I guess i can fiddle and see..
[13:15:07] <Nomikos> handibar: I'd try to simplify the whole thing a little
[13:15:24] <Nomikos> handibar: like hide the <tr>s that need hidden, with css
[13:15:57] <Nomikos> and you can toggle multiple classes - toggleClass('foo bar bazz')
[13:17:09] <handibar> Nomikos: Oh.. so toggleClass('InnerTR23 InnerTR24 InnerTR25').display; ?
[13:17:15] <Nomikos> for example.
[13:19:29] <David_Bradbury> So I add an event listener when the page loads to all h3 elements. Later on I add more h3 elements and want them to also have these events attached to them. Is there a way to make sure this happens automatically without having to add an extra listener for each new element?
[13:20:20] <Nomikos> David_Bradbury: this used to be done with .live(), but with jQuery 1.7 it should be possible with .on()
[13:20:49] <Nomikos> I think it'd be $(document).on('click', 'h3', function() { ..
[13:22:16] <David_Bradbury> Well, wouldn't I still be having to manually add the event after every new h3 I'm inserting in?
[13:22:32] <David_Bradbury> Or do I just need to do that once at the beginning?
[13:22:45] <Nomikos> Yes, once at the beginning.
[13:22:50] <David_Bradbury> Kk :)
[13:25:24] <David_Bradbury> Nomikos: Awesome, worked perfectly
[13:25:46] <Nomikos> woo
[13:30:37] <handibar> Oh.. I just learned something about classes.. Wow. Yeah..
[13:31:09] <Nomikos> there's got to be a bad pun in there somewhere
[13:31:25] <handibar> Your polite reply.. it was so polite .. :)
[13:31:51] <handibar> Er advice
[13:32:09] <handibar> I honestly thought an element could only have a single class
[13:32:21] <Nomikos> ah, well, learn something new every day :)
[13:32:30] <handibar> Yeah but wow.. That's big. ;)
[13:33:08] <Nomikos> I think this is the first time I've been accused of being polite :p
[13:33:09] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky first week was awesome, as maddening as CSS can make me. :D
[13:33:10] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[13:33:23] <Nomikos> or too polite, or whatevs
[13:34:22] <prometh> is it possible to do something like this:   $("something").each(functionName, [arg1,arg2]);  // ?
[13:34:52] <handibar> Well I've been teaching myself how to keep this internal reporting stuff working and now I'm trying to add some improvements, but when you teach yourself you never know what important things you may have not learned?
[13:35:24] <Nomikos> ah right
[13:35:35] <prometh> handibar: you know how many things people study in school and never remember? :P
[13:35:43] <Nomikos> prometh: why not specify the arguments inside the function?
[13:35:51] <prometh> Nomikos: wasted memory on the anonymous function
[13:36:09] <nFFF> prometh, $("something").each(function(){ fooBar(arg1,arg2); });
[13:36:19] <prometh> nFFF: wasted memory :P
[13:36:39] <Nomikos> what is this running on, an analog watch? :-p
[13:36:46] <prometh> my browser (webkit) crashes all the time on improperly-coded jquery sites... i'm trying to avoid that on my sites
[13:36:58] <handibar> prometh: This is true.. but in my case that was my math prof's fault for wearing outrageous buttons on ugly sweaters.. they were far more fascinating than his ramblings about the orders of operations given the circumstance of the.. zzz..
[13:37:13] <prometh> handibar: yeah, school sucks
[13:37:48] <David_Bradbury> Hmm. So I copied an h3 element and by using the event method .on(), the new one works great. Now, I just copied another div with some LI's inside, and those new LI's don't seem to want to work
[13:38:22] <David_Bradbury> Well, a div with a ul inside that contains li's
[13:38:33] <Nomikos> with <h3>s ?
[13:38:42] <David_Bradbury> Nope, two different events
[13:38:49] <David_Bradbury> but I'm calling using the same on method
[13:38:55] <David_Bradbury> err
[13:39:04] <David_Bradbury> I'm using the on method on both
[13:39:09] <David_Bradbury> not the same on method
[13:39:37] <David_Bradbury> One is - $("#main-pane>div>div ul").on("click",function(e)...
[13:39:51] <handibar> prometh: Well on the whole it's great, but too much of anything sucks.. We need to design a school system that blends chores with learning, also the parents should be the teachers, teachers should be assisting the parents with the material. :p
[13:39:59] <David_Bradbury> The other is - $("#main-pane").on("click", "h3", function(e)...
[13:40:03] <Nomikos> David_Bradbury: ah.. on() is tricky like that, the first selector has to exist from the start
[13:40:31] <prometh> handibar: parents can't be expected to study along, though.. no time fo rit
[13:40:38] <David_Bradbury> So maybe
[13:41:13] <Nomikos> David_Bradbury: with the h3, #main-pane catches the click event and hands them to the new h3s. With the other, you want to similarly first specify the element that is already there (wrapper), then in on() the newly created ones
[13:41:25] <David_Bradbury> Ah
[13:41:44] <David_Bradbury> $("#main-pane").on("click","div>div ul" lufunction(e)...
[13:41:47] <David_Bradbury> Something like that?
[13:41:49] <Nomikos> that should work
[13:41:53] <David_Bradbury> minus the typo
[13:42:06] <Nomikos> that should work even better :p
[13:42:06] <handibar> prometh: well at a certain point you do get to a grade where you need to work direct with a teacher.. I was just high on pizza and thinking about the basics of our education problem.. and how early years in school in NA are more day-care than anything
[13:42:21] <David_Bradbury> Yup, worked great!
[13:43:19] <prometh> yep... apprenticeship is the best way
[13:43:37] <prometh> construction had this figured out eons ago
[13:46:20] <prometh> but, irc is awesome
[13:46:28] <prometh> i never went to school... waste of money
[13:46:42] <prometh> i taught myself, read books, and helped/asked on irc
[13:46:56] <handibar> In fact it should almost be a small community school for youths with advanced self-learning systems that are run by rotations of parents assisted by teachers this way kids still socialize and spread germs around to build wicked immunities.. but the parents also are involved in a way that lets them meet each other and the kids..
[13:47:18] <handibar> I wasted money on school and still needed IRC.. ;)
[13:47:23] <prometh> :)
[13:47:37] <prometh> the great thing about irc is you learn by helping people as well as asking for help
[13:47:42] <prometh> and you can joke around n shit
[13:47:44] <Nomikos> handibar: that is socialist commie crazy talk
[13:47:56] <prometh> and no one has to know what anyone looks like... removes some time-wasting barriers
[13:47:58] <Nomikos> you want to end up like Western Europe or something?
[13:47:59] <iwantcream> howdy. disclaimer: i am not down with jquery or javascript. sorry for asking. but perhaps there's a simple solution.
[13:48:01] <iwantcream> why can't both of these scripts function. if i add one the other stops working. http://pastebin.com/hDS54B0s
[13:48:09] <prometh> take me... i'm hot.... it would be distracting :P
[13:48:09] <Nomikos> with low crime rates and high living standards?
[13:48:40] <handibar> Hahaha.. Yeah you can tell when someone hasn't stepped off the continent eh? ;)
[13:48:40] <prometh> the education system has become a money-making business
[13:48:49] <prometh> "want an education.. $50,000 .... no guarantee it'll be good shit, though"
[13:48:56] <iwantcream> i'm from commie socialist sweden!
[13:48:58] <iwantcream> here is lovely
[13:49:04] <prometh> i'm in canada
[13:49:10] <Haprog> Free education in Finland <3
[13:49:21] <prometh> free university!?
[13:49:25] <Haprog> yeah
[13:49:29] <prometh> now that's the future.
[13:49:35] <rue> Well, taxpayer-funded, but yes.
[13:49:36] <iwantcream> prometh: yes, here too
[13:49:39] <gloomer> ya /me wants citizenship
[13:49:46] <prometh> that's great.. here it's $30,000-$50,000
[13:49:50] <iwantcream> prometh: what?
[13:49:58] <prometh> so mommy and daddy pay for it.... not me, though
[13:50:02] <rue> Yeah, I had some of that
[13:50:06] <prometh> and i always felt it was a waste of time.... i hate school
[13:50:21] <iwantcream> so that means rich people gets an education
[13:50:21] <Haprog> well I do pay some less than 90e/year for the student union membership which is obligatory at the uni
[13:50:26] <iwantcream> great way to segragate society
[13:50:45] <prometh> iwantcream: yeah, but everyone pays for it... even the middle class
[13:50:47] <rue> prometh: Until I think this last fall, foreigners were also able to study for free
[13:50:58] <prometh> people  here live outside of their means... all in debt
[13:51:23] <prometh> mommy and daddy pay for whatever their kids want... laptops, cellphones, xbox360s, university/college
[13:51:38] <prometh> and then the kids bitch and complain about the system... OWS
[13:51:58] <prometh> wasting $100,000s picketing
[13:52:00] <Nomikos> sounds like not getting kids is the way to go
[13:52:05] <prometh> hehe
[13:52:11] <prometh> or teaching them to teach themselves
[13:52:14] <handibar> prometh: Canadian but I only wasted $15k on school and certs.. ;p
[13:52:15] <Nomikos> to be fair, the system /is/ a bit fucked up
[13:52:18] <prometh> so they can grow up into awesome people like me
[13:52:44] <prometh> Nomikos: sure is... but wasting $100,000s of MY money picketing and going nowhere is even more fucked up
[13:52:52] <handibar> actually closer to $12k after grants/bursaries..
[13:52:58] <gloomer> luckily in it degrees dont mean as much
[13:53:06] <gloomer> IT
[13:53:12] <prometh> if someone wants to go to school and puts in the effort to get something out of it, i have no probelm with it
[13:53:23] <prometh> it's these spoiled brats that do nothing with it.. it's just anohter cell phone
[13:53:25] <Nomikos> how are the kids wasting your money picketing?
[13:53:33] <prometh> we have to clean up after them
[13:53:36] <prometh> remember OWS?
[13:53:39] <Nomikos> yeah
[13:53:44] <prometh> $100,000 cleaning up their shit
[13:53:50] <Nomikos> drop in the bucket
[13:53:51] <prometh> and what did they accomplish? not a goddamnt hing
[13:54:06] <Nomikos> so they shouldn't protest anymore?
[13:54:07] <handibar> glomer: too true .. the school that diploma'd me was so bad that I *had* to get MS cert just to prove the diploma wasn't a joke..
[13:54:15] <prometh> protesting is fine... but have a plan of ACTION
[13:54:18] <handibar> and even then.. MS certs? .. are a joke
[13:54:22] <prometh> making a sign doesn't do shit
[13:54:28] <gloomer> ya i just expect to code at interview
[13:54:52] <Nomikos> anything that will work better is going to cost more in cleaning up
[13:55:03] <Nomikos> we've seen how well voting has worked
[13:55:04] <prometh> they accomplished nothing
[13:55:09] <gloomer> prometh, they got on the news for a few days
[13:55:16] <gloomer> changed the discussion a tiny bit
[13:55:19] <Nomikos> and the news only gave airtime to the nutcases
[13:55:21] <handibar> prometh: We still have people camping against the 1% in my city square..
[13:55:27] <prometh> gloomer: yeah, lol
[13:55:42] <prometh> handibar: those are just the shrapnels
[13:56:54] <handibar> prometh: Yeah they don't even linger during bad weather, but they come back with the fancy tents and colorful signs to keep everyone mindful that the problem didn't go anywhere so that's more than I've done. ;)
[13:57:16] <prometh> if i cared enough, i would've came up with a plan of action
[13:57:26] <prometh> to me, they just look like bums begging for change.... ignored
[13:57:46] <Nomikos> that's how the media portrays them, sure :-)
[13:58:02] <prometh> i saw htem all on facebook... "friends" of mine
[13:58:07] <prometh> "love is the answer"
[13:58:09] <prometh> fucking hippies
[13:58:13] <handibar> well that's the thing the latest group camping and picketing seem to be organized/paid .. really official about it.. other than the sleeping in the tent thing..
[13:58:38] <prometh> they're just making symbols of themselves... symbols are worthless without action
[13:58:44] <prometh> batman had a symbol... but batman was batman!
[13:58:50] <prometh> these kids are bums
[13:59:12] <handibar> Hell if they could just rotate enough people through so everyone's only down there for a few hours.. they could skip the tent all together and clean up the image of the protest
[13:59:14] <Nomikos> .. right
[13:59:26] <prometh> they need to take action
[13:59:29] <handibar> you mean a man dressed like a bat?
[13:59:30] <prometh> get some political power
[13:59:34] <Nomikos> I'll call batman, see if he can sort itout
[13:59:38] <prometh> handibar: nah.. kicking ass
[14:00:10] <prometh> making signs is no different than a twitter tweet
[14:00:12] <handibar> http://xkcd.com/1004/
[14:00:17] <prometh> "i have the force.. listen to me!"
[14:00:44] <Nomikos> to get into politics you need money, which is the one thing they don't have.
[14:01:00] <Nomikos> and the large corps only finance your party if you do what they tell you to
[14:01:08] <Nomikos> ... which is what they're protesting against
[14:01:17] <prometh> there are ways around money
[14:01:29] <Eviltwin> You'll all be happy to know that myedaccount.com is made using jQuery 1.5.1 and jQuery UI 1.8.6
[14:01:49] <prometh> school doesn't teach kids to come up with new ideas... it just teaches them the past
[14:01:55] <prometh> that's where self-education comes in
[14:03:38] <prometh> you only get out of any kind of education what youput into it.... and these days, everyone and their dog has a post-secondary diploma
[14:03:43] <handibar> I dunno.. there's lots of money loitering in our society.. people seem to be looking for interesting ways to be generous now that we've become more of an information society it's clearly possibly to divert cash to worthy causes .. and what's more novel than a rich person sticking up for the poor?
[14:03:49] <prometh> gotta find ways to stand out.. to go around thebullshit
[14:03:55] <prometh> same with OWS... they need to find a way around money
[14:04:18] <prometh> OWS wasn't clever enough
[14:04:28] <handibar> exactly..
[14:04:35] <prometh> i'm for the movement.... they have the right core idea
[14:04:40] <prometh> but they are not people of action
[14:04:44] <prometh> they just made signs
[14:04:50] <Nomikos> what would you have them /do/ ??
[14:04:59] <prometh> i'm not in politics... i don't know
[14:05:00] <handibar> well .. they were people of 'just action' ..
[14:05:19] <prometh> it's like kids who play music
[14:05:25] <prometh> the ones who make it are not the scholars
[14:05:33] <prometh> "i know this scale an that chord" ... no one cares
[14:05:39] <prometh> they want something that sounds good
[14:06:29] <prometh> OWS has to do something very clever and smart... not just make signs
[14:06:40] <Nomikos> right. you said that.
[14:06:41] <prometh> i dont' know what... i'm not into politics
[14:06:54] <prometh> if i was, i'd probably be their John Connor ;)
[14:07:02] * Nomikos leaves voicemail for Batman and goes to find something to eat
[14:07:21] <prometh> i'm a website batman :)
[14:07:27] <prometh> not political batman
[14:09:13] <rhizmoe> i have a click handler for items on a page, that i want to retrieve comments for that item and display them in a sidebar. my instinct is to return the comments as JSON, but does that mean i have to write a bunch of html in JS? I can just as easily return a hunk of HTML from the server, so I'm trying to figure out, i guess, whether prerendering is better than straight json.

[14:27:31] <Aquaguy> Hello
[14:28:15] <Aquaguy> is there any way to get/set the selection caret at a certain position of a <pre> element which is contenteditable
[14:28:29] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: Depends on the browser
[14:28:44] <Eviltwin> There's what everybody does and then there's what IE does
[14:29:13] <verdoc> http://api.jquery.com/ :( ?
[14:30:00] <Aquaguy> Eviltwin, It's for an adobe air app I dont know which browser air uses
[14:30:15] <Aquaguy> i dont know if it's webkit based or what
[14:30:47] <Eviltwin> It's pretty much everyone other than IE that adheres to the W3B spec
[14:30:50] <Eviltwin> W3C*
[14:32:31] <handibar> Okay I'm dum.. I've tried all sorts of things.. now I'm not even getting onClick to fire? http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/14/
[14:32:40] <Aquaguy> Eviltwin so how could I do it?
[14:33:37] <Eviltwin> Aquaguy: I only have to do it occasionally but the last time I referred to this for help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4233265/contenteditable-set-caret-at-the-end-of-the-text-cross-browser
[14:36:24] <whomp> where is a good site to learn everything about jquery?
[14:38:53] <Qalqi> books are better sources to learn
[14:39:08] <Qalqi> lots of good ebooks exist all over
[14:39:13] <john-dev> jquery.com
[14:39:45] <Qalqi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books
[14:40:07] <whomp> i think ill start with jquery in action
[14:40:20] <Qalqi> Anyone suggest jquery method to replace all text within an element
[14:40:36] <Qalqi> jquery.com is down at  present
[14:40:39] <Kit-10> ?.text @ Qalqi
[14:40:39] <bot-t> Qalqi, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[14:41:00] <Kit-10> same method but pass it a value
[14:42:22] <Kit-10> also Qalqi .. google cache has good coverage of api.jquery.com
[14:43:27] <Qalqi> thanks
[14:44:17] <handibar> Hahahaha.. Oh man.. so dum.. http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/22/  .. I was so excited.. but it's not using toggle class.. so it's not going to un-show them.. ;p
[14:44:36] <handibar> Anyone want to help me make that work 'properly' with toggle class?
[14:44:45] <handibar> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[14:47:32] <Kit-10> handibar make what work?
[14:47:38] <Kit-10> i see no jquery code at all
[14:48:52] <handibar> Well I could use toggleClass to fix that? .. toggle the 'sub' class? er.. tr.sub? .. Oh it's using onclick.. I need to learn event
[14:49:13] <handibar> I'd LOVE and example of just changing that to an event..
[14:49:24] <handibar> JUST .. nothing else.. I'm so easily lost
[14:49:26] <Eviltwin> toggleClass is basically if(this.hasClass(myClass)) { this.removeClass(myClass) } else { this.addClass(myClass) }
[14:49:44] <Eviltwin> Classes and events...do very different things
[14:50:15] <handibar> Yeah I know.. I was saying he can't see the jquery cause I used 'onClick' in the actual elements
[14:50:25] <handibar> And I should have used an event handler?
[14:50:34] <Kit-10> definitely
[14:50:38] <handibar> But haven't figured that out *sheepish*
[14:50:42] <Kit-10> an he, is not a he
[14:50:56] <handibar> Opps
[14:51:13] <Kit-10> no worries handibar :)

[14:58:26] <Kit-10> handibar actually use http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/27/
[14:58:40] <Kit-10> that's nicer code :p and fixes the issue on the 1st item.
[14:58:51] <Kit-10> you might want to fix width those items though.

[15:07:10] <adac> I have a textboxt and I like to fire an ajax request everytime this textbox changes. What is the correct "listener" for this? .change does seem to fire only when I hit enter or do click with mouse
[15:07:37] <Eviltwin> keyup
[15:07:41] <Eviltwin> Or keypress
[15:10:13] <Kit-10> adac you might want to put a timer on that
[15:10:56] <Kit-10> so that it only triggers after a set timeout after the user presses the key, that way it's not going to fire off hundreds of requests
[15:11:38] <Eviltwin> adac: Here's an example of how to do what Kit-10 described: http://jsfiddle.net/PPNBW/1/
[15:12:56] <dogarrhea2> so e.originalEvent is not supported in ie8 right?

[15:13:24] <dogarrhea2> i just tried it

[15:13:31] <dogarrhea2> when i try pageX
[15:13:42] <handibar> Kit-10: Oh man I just came back so excited about: http://jsfiddle.net/Y3NFt/37/  .. Admittedly I still needed a clean way to get the ID# into the function.. but so close.. :p
[15:13:58] <handibar> (Your version is so much cleaner.. Thanks! :) )
[15:14:04] <adac> Eviltwin, Kit-10 thank you!
[15:14:35] <dogarrhea2> how do i get around the limitation
[15:14:37] <Kit-10> handibar no worries. When you do this kind of thing day in/out you get used to it
[15:14:43] <dogarrhea2> [Fiddler] The socket connection to api.jquery.com failed.  A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 70.32.121.205:80

[15:19:33] <SP33D> can some one help me to build a autocomplet future ? i got a search box where i wanna add autocomplet to and i got the data for the autocomplet
[15:19:50] <SP33D> but i am reading jquery ui autocomplet since 5 days and found no way to bring all that together
[15:20:27] <SP33D> i am to silly to know what to do to use my data i got a php page that does the query ^^ and return plain text results line seperated
[15:21:17] <SP33D> but thats all i got maybe some one can tel me a more easy way to query my php file on key hit and attach that to the text box
[15:21:24] <SP33D> since this autocomplet is so bad documented
[15:22:25] <dogarrhea2> how do i get the pageX in ie8 and lower
[15:22:37] <Keith__> Anyone notice that API.jquery.com is down?  Server not responding, no ping response.
[15:22:43] <dogarrhea2> yes i just noticed
[15:22:46] <dogarrhea2> 5 minutes ago
[15:22:51] <handibar> SP33D: I had a heck of a time with it to .. for me it was creating the right object/array (can't recall which one it wanted) and then when I had that licked it would auto-complete with my data.. I assume you have it working with a var = an 'example' string
[15:22:52] <dogarrhea2> can't search can't use it
[15:23:27] <Keith__> The server itself seems to be down, no response to a ping, let alone http.
[15:24:37] <SP33D> hand ok so i will probally get it working when i use the json method
[15:24:47] <SP33D> but i am thinking there must be a more easy way
[15:24:57] <SP33D> i simply wanna display my clear text results
[15:25:09] <SP33D> in the suggestion box but ok ok
[15:25:53] <dogarrhea2> did someone rape the jquery server?

[15:29:28] <handibar> SP33D: You think that's bad.. when I was done getting my ajax response into the right object/array format, I had the project change so I had 3 different 'categories' of autocomplete data.. so I wanted to have it show "Foo (Category 1)" and "Foo (Category 4)" in the drop down as I type in "Foo" .. ;p   I never did finish it

[16:51:44] <WintermeW> hi. i'm tring to bind a function to document resize events ( simply with $(document).resize(function() {alert('foo'); }); ) but it never gets fired whatever happens ( tested w/ FF 7.0.1 ), and my js console doesn't trigger any error..does anybody have an explaination ?
[16:52:16] <erichynds> bind resize to window, not document
[16:52:19] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: it looks like I'm not going to be able to mirror my local dev env today.   I've uploaded the relevant code to http://pastebin.com/tR9QUsu2
[16:52:52] <WintermeW> it doesn't interest me..my window doesnt change in size, my document/body does
[16:53:26] <eddiemonge> how/what are you resizing?
[16:54:11] <erichynds> WintermeW: the resize event only fires when the window changes, it won't fire on document.
[16:54:36] <WintermeW> i want a div having the same height as my document..of course height:100% doesn't work if my doc is more than 100% of the window's height
[16:55:07] <danieliser> is there a way to get multiple sections of a page via .load()
[16:55:43] <john-dev> you mean div's?
[16:56:07] <eddiemonge> WintermeW: that doesnt really describe what you are trying to do
[16:56:48] <danieliser> sorry want to do something like .load("path/to/fragment.html  .dynamic_data") but i need mroe than 1 section
[16:57:18] <danieliser> prefer to not have to make multiple calls.. im assuming probably need to just load the whole thing and then pull out what i need
[16:57:44] <john-dev> or use php and seperate the ouput
[16:58:00] <john-dev> or multiple files..
[16:58:03] <coldhead> danieliser: .dynamic_data,.less_interesting_data,#someOther_selector
[16:58:21] <john-dev> or like that
[16:58:29] <danieliser> coldhead: will they be returned like an object/array?
[16:58:50] <coldhead> no, it will just dump it in the elements you've already selected
[16:59:02] <danieliser> so load is out..
[16:59:11] <john-dev> use $.ajax
[16:59:12] <coldhead> $('#everything_goes_here').load('some_url #buncha_selectors')
[16:59:22] <danieliser> oh wait nvm that might work perfect.. ill just order them the way i need in the call
[16:59:22] <coldhead> yeah use ajax and do you fancyness
[16:59:25] <WintermeW> ok..i'll try to be more clear: i have two adjacent divs, the right div's content changes dynamically with xhr calls, so it gets extended, and sometimes it gets longer than 100% ..and then, my left div becomes to small compared to the other. i want it to be the same exact size than the right one
[17:01:24] <eddiemonge> WintermeW: thats not a resize event. thats a "add equal sizer function to ajax callback"

[17:04:58] <WintermeW> eddiemonge: yes i can do that, but i was sure i was able to bind resize events on any object..as a proof, when doing inline js, you can place onresize="" attr on any object

[17:41:00] <RangerRick> quick question; I'm making a jquery mobile app with 3 "page" divs in it, all the navigation works properly, but if I reload index.html#schedule (no the default page) and then hit the back button, it does a forward animamtion instead of sliding back
[17:41:35] <RangerRick> if someone reloads the url with a #non-default-page set, do I need to prime the history somehow?  it doesn't seem to be enough to do eg: <a href="#menu" data-rel="back" data-icon="arrow-l" data-direction="reverse">Back</a>

[18:36:26] <diverdude> eddiemonge: its not going to the front end actually
[18:38:32] <eddiemonge> diverdude: im confused then
[18:38:46] <diverdude> eddiemonge: its for a node.js module
[18:38:56] <diverdude> eddiemonge: which runs backend

[18:41:03] <diverdude> eddiemonge: what about the topic?
[18:41:35] <eddiemonge> i thought i was in #jquery
[18:41:54] <diverdude> eddiemonge: yes so?
[18:43:59] <eddiemonge> what is your jquery question?
[18:44:14] <mansoor-s> eddiemonge: I think you are confused. jQuery is a brand of potato chips

[18:46:22] <diverdude> how to parse a serialized php-session string with jquery. is there a lib for that?

[18:47:17] <mansoor-s> how is it serialized?

[19:06:30] <methoddk> does everything in jQuery need to be in a function?

[19:16:18] <mansoor-s> methoddk: methods... but you can call them functions if you like :)
[19:19:12] <methoddk> what i mean is, does everything always have to be in a $(document).ready(function() // code here {});

[20:02:16] <Aquaguy> what's the best way of indenting code like this one http://pastebin.com/NXzTfckV using jQuery?
[20:02:49] <h1ll37> kborchers: but how do i tell what character to start at? i'm confused
[20:03:11] <kborchers> h1ll37: doesn't matter
[20:03:25] <kborchers> just matches what you gave with the characters at the end of the string
[20:03:34] <h1ll37> oh like regex sorta
[20:03:41] <kborchers> bingo
[20:03:50] <h1ll37> kborchers: thanks man i appreciate it!
[20:03:57] <kborchers> :)
[20:04:25] <h1ll37> jquery irc is the best one i've been in for help.
[20:05:58] <h1ll37> kborchers: how do i do != to with that.. !$= wont' work lol
[20:07:38] <kborchers> h1ll37: what are you trying to do?
[20:08:27] <h1ll37> kborchers: diming certain pictures if they aren't in a group but they need a number for something else
[20:09:45] <kborchers> this would probably work a lot better with classes
[20:11:01] <kborchers> do your grouping with classes, then you can filter by class with not see ?not
[20:11:02] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[20:11:09] <kborchers> if api ever comes back up ;)
[20:12:02] <kborchers> h1ll37: so you could use something like $("img").not(".className").fadeTo....
[20:12:18] <kborchers> and you would want something more precise than just $("img") but you get the idea
[20:12:51] <h1ll37> kborchers: thanks a ton. but i gotta go. thanks man
[20:13:31] <kborchers> no problem, good luck
[20:54:46] <Articate> What's a sensible way to make a link that contains information that jQuery can use?
[20:55:36] <Articate> I'm trying to make a help-function for my site, and I want to make links that can sort of bring out certain parts of the site, so I want a link that contains the name of a div to use different styling on.
[20:56:05] <rody> hey guys, does .trigger() actually triggers an event on the DOM? (if i have 2 "instances" of jquery. if one binds an event, and the other tries to trigger it, will the binded event be triggered?)
[20:56:08] <Articate> or, that was my initial idea. So I'm wondering what the best way to execute that is
[21:10:01] <zduffy_> Im wondering if someone would be so kind to help me. I need to validate two forms, and submit only one if that one validates, if the other one is not valid then it should submit the other form. Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/MJruVjiK
[21:12:54] <bnlbjn> zduffy: what is wrong with your code? is that not working as expected?
[21:13:27] <zduffy_> it always validates BookingCCForm when it is not valid
[21:14:28] <bnlbjn> so you mean this always results in true?    if ($("#BookingCCForm").valid())
[21:16:02] <nobitanobi> Is there any library that will let me put some ***** in password input text ?
[21:16:12] <nobitanobi> or any other field
[21:16:21] <nobitanobi> some text that won't be submitted, but is just decoration for a field
[21:17:49] <zduffy_> bnlbjn: that is correct
[21:18:05] <bnlbjn> nobitanobi: why not <input type="password"/>?
[21:18:28] <nobitanobi> bnlbjn: that will work if I type something
[21:18:30] <zduffy_> nobitanobi: are you looking for graphics or astrix?
[21:18:34] <nobitanobi> I want to decorate when editing the form
[21:18:40] <bnlbjn> zduffy_:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3623879/why-does-the-jquery-valid-method-always-return-true
[21:18:41] <nobitanobi> I think in HTML5 is this placeholder="Comments"
[21:19:31] <bnlbjn> nobitanobi: that disappears once you type in something
[21:19:39] <nobitanobi> that's perfect
[21:19:42] <nobitanobi> for what I'm looking
[21:19:50] <eddiemonge> nobitanobi: then why dont you use placeholder?
[21:20:20] <nobitanobi> I could. I wast just wondering how could I do in jquery, of it there was any library that could do that.
[21:22:06] <eddiemonge> nobitanobi: no need to do in JS what HTML will do natively
[21:22:11] <eddiemonge> in most browsers that is
[21:22:18] <eddiemonge> and you can use a shim for IE
[21:24:04] <nobitanobi> ok
[21:24:10] <nobitanobi> thanks for the recomm guys
[21:28:30] <zduffy_> bnlbjn: took away the ids and its still happening
[21:30:59] <bnlbjn> check your vaidate method. i gotta go now
[21:32:15] <mrryanjohnston> I'm hoping to take a url (ex. http(s)://foo.bar.com/bat/baz) and grab the bat/baz bit. Is this best done with a regex, or is there some sort of jquery "grab the path" function?
[21:32:25] <methoddk> regex it
[21:32:27] <methoddk> easy
[21:32:32] <mrryanjohnston> mk
[21:32:42] <mrryanjohnston> didn't know if jquery had a little utility function or not
[21:32:47] <methoddk> im not sure
[21:33:07] <methoddk> you could split the string on / char
[21:33:31] <methoddk> and then grab the 2 to end
[21:33:43] <mrryanjohnston> it'll never always be 2
[21:33:56] <mrryanjohnston> but I guess I could assume it'll always be http://blach/
[21:34:02] <mrryanjohnston> and just grab 2-end
[21:34:53] <methoddk> it would always be two. domains don't have slashes
[21:35:27] <mrryanjohnston> true
[21:36:46] <ivanBliminse> Hi, can someone help with a really easy problem I can't seem to figure out? I need to be able to do a ... $('child of span#whatever).click(function(){ ... });... I have an <a href =''></a> inside of a <span></span>, and I want something to happen when the link is clicked, without having to give it it's own id or class
[21:37:26] <methoddk> paste code on jsfiddle
[21:39:25] <ivanBliminse> http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/
[21:40:07] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse:  $("span.classSomething > a").on("click", function() {})
[21:41:36] <ivanBliminse> does it have to be a class? I need it to be an ID
[21:42:11] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ ivanBliminse
[21:42:13] <bot-t> ivanBliminse, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[21:42:30] <eddiemonge> mrryanjohnston: why dont you just use window.location.pathname?
[21:44:23] <mrryanjohnston> eddiemonge: it's not the window.location. It's a string that's a url.
[21:44:39] <mrryanjohnston> eddiemonge: I have to force absolute urls to become relative urls
[21:46:50] <ivanBliminse> eddiemonge: I read that.. and it's still not seeming to work.. i've updated here http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/1/... can you update it , and save it so I can see what to do?
[21:46:59] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/2/
[21:47:12] <eddiemonge> mrryanjohnston: why?
[21:47:17] <gloomer> make sure you include the jquery library
[21:47:41] <ivanBliminse> thanks gloomer... i can't have javascript:void... that makes sense
[21:49:06] <gloomer> no you can have that
[21:49:08] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/5/
[21:49:12] <gloomer> just must include library
[21:50:01] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: i think this is what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/6/
[21:51:28] <mrryanjohnston> eddiemonge: because I'm using a wysiwyg that puts in images via a gui. The wysiwyg constructs the src="" out of an absolute url. However, these images can be inserted from other domains, so it'll come up with stuff like http://other-domain/foobar.jpg. There is only one domain that viewers go to, though, and I want the images to be shown as coming from that domain
[21:51:37] <mrryanjohnston> eddiemonge: does that make sense?
[21:51:59] <eddiemonge> not really
[21:52:46] <gloomer> mrryanjohnston copy pictures to local directory then
[21:55:58] <ivanBliminse> gloomer, eddiemonge: thanks for the help.. i see how it works on the jsfiddle but when I paste it into my page it doesn't work.. but be some other conflict..
[21:58:37] <gloomer> ivanBliminse you are probably not including the jquery library
[21:58:52] <StevenCodes22> sup ppl
[21:59:12] <ivanBliminse> gloomer : that was my first thought to.. but I have the latest version and other jquery elements work on the page
[21:59:24] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: are there any errors on the console?
[22:00:06] <StevenCodes22> ivanBliminse:  problem
[22:00:07] <StevenCodes22> ?
[22:00:43] <ivanBliminse> eddiemonge: doesn't appear to be
[22:01:26] <ivanBliminse> StevenCodes22: yeah i'm trying to do some wickedly simple JQuery and it's not working on my site for some reason...it works here http://jsfiddle.net/2EbXS/5/ ... but when I paste into my site it doesn't work
[22:01:48] <StevenCodes22> ivanBliminse:  PM link ?
[22:06:01] <ivanBliminse> StevenCodes22 : what i'm doing is burried in accounts.. but this link highlights the problem... http://71.57.193.98/
[22:06:43] <StevenCodes22> ivanBliminse:  I said PM so you didnt have to share link publically
[22:06:49] <StevenCodes22> checking though :)
[22:07:30] <ivanBliminse> no worries
[22:08:07] <ivanBliminse> It was grabbing some copy and paste garbage... I retyped by hand, it got rid of the $*# looking stuff and seems to work now
[22:08:42] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: why do you have href="javascript:xxx ?
[22:08:59] <eddiemonge> and why jquery 1.4.2?
[22:09:21] <ivanBliminse> eddiemonge: just to make it a link that doesn't do anything when clicked... and I just grabbed that off of w3c schools link
[22:09:27] <eddiemonge> and $("#mySpan").children("a") is better
[22:09:38] <eddiemonge> ?w3schools @ ivanBliminse
[22:09:38] <ivanBliminse> Why is that?
[22:09:38] <bot-t> ivanBliminse, http://w3fools.com
[22:09:45] <eddiemonge> because it is
[22:10:04] <eddiemonge> use my example. you dont need the void() part. thats what preventDefault is for
[22:10:40] <StevenCodes22> back sorry
[22:11:45] <StevenCodes22> Doesnt he have to use jquery 1.7 ?
[22:12:26] <eddiemonge> only for the .on() part
[22:12:45] <eddiemonge> but that can be swapped for bind() for jq < 1.7
[22:13:09] <ivanBliminse> eddiemonge: thanks for the link, I didn't realize they weren't the same people!!.. I realize preventDefault does that... but javascript:void is easier.. even the boys at google use it on their homepage
[22:14:10] <StevenCodes22> idk its hard to really test it out without using your server cause works for me
[22:14:21] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: its bad to use it. its better to use preventDefault
[22:14:52] <ivanBliminse> eddiemonge : then why do the google engineers use it?
[22:15:52] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: because they arent perfect
[22:16:17] <eddiemonge> they also dont care about javascript disabled it seems
[22:16:48] <ivanBliminse> I don't disagree with you.
[22:19:08] <optraz> $(function() { }); does this equivalent to $(document).ready(function(){
[22:19:15] <optraz> }); ?
[22:19:16] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: read the last sentence of https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
[22:19:20] <mutedia> pretty sure it is
[22:19:26] <eddiemonge> optraz: yes
[22:19:27] <mutedia> it's shorthand for it
[22:21:59] <ivanBliminse> edditmonge: I think i've read that before...... so you should always do a href='#'...?
[22:23:58] <Eviltwin> ivanBliminse: Not necessarily
[22:24:09] <Eviltwin> If not handled correctly, that can cause your page to jump unexpectedly
[22:24:11] <eddiemonge> ivanBliminse: no. you should usually have an actual address in there
[22:24:25] <eddiemonge> as a fallback when js is disabled
[22:24:32] <Eviltwin> The goal is that if JS were removed, your site still "works"
[22:24:33] <LordThumper> Does anyone know of a good plugin that gives me a dropdown combobox with images?
[22:24:34] <eddiemonge> otherwise, why not use a button?
[22:24:39] <LordThumper> And autocomplete?
[22:24:50] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: like jqueryui autocomplete?
[22:25:23] <LordThumper> Exactly, however the jQueryUI is getting the default theme which I am using for datepicker etc
[22:25:26] <LordThumper> Which I dont like
[22:25:37] <LordThumper> And doesnt support images by default
[22:25:49] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: no but there is an example to use custom output
[22:26:00] <LordThumper> let me see
[22:26:01] <eddiemonge> and you can override the default styling
[22:26:07] <LordThumper> oh?
[22:26:14] <Cork> LordThumper: your looking for autocomplete or just a normal combobox/<select> box?
[22:26:30] <Cork> cause 1.9 has the menu widget
[22:26:39] <Cork> and it might be what your looking for
[22:26:58] <LordThumper> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[22:27:01] <LordThumper> Exactly like that
[22:28:28] <Cork> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[22:28:40] <LordThumper> Prefer not to use a nightly, is that out soon?
[22:29:03] <Cork> (theres a lot of old plugins listed on that page)
[22:30:25] <LordThumper> Is there any way to make jQueryUI use default style?
[22:30:47] <LordThumper> (not using the images in the custom style folder)
[22:30:55] <Cork> default?
[22:31:00] <LordThumper> I am using "Trontastic" i think...
[22:31:17] <Cork> you mean the colorless gray look?
[22:31:20] <LordThumper> yes
[22:31:29] <LordThumper> Or is that a theme on its own?
[22:31:35] <Cork> ya
[22:31:54] <ivanBliminse> Thanks for all the help! have a great night
[22:32:21] <LordThumper> Well I must be doing something wrong then
[22:32:34] <LordThumper> My combobox seems to be double the size of a normal one
[22:32:43] <LordThumper> And definately larger than the "default" theme
[22:33:00] <Cork> its wrapped elements
[22:33:06] <Cork> jquery-ui has that problem
[22:33:15] <Cork> it uses em for dimentions
[22:33:22] <Cork> and it inherits from parents
[22:33:34] <LordThumper> oh
[22:33:45] <LordThumper> Any solution?
[22:33:58] <Cork> you need to overide the css rules
[22:34:29] <Cork> <body style="font-size: 10px"><div style="font-size: 2em (20px)"><div style="font-size: 2em (40em)"></div></div></div>
[22:34:44] <Cork> opps s/40em/40px/
[22:35:58] <prometh> how would i go about checking the parents for a div with a classname CONTAINING "step" ? i have step1, step2, etc
[22:36:07] <LordThumper> The ul created is absolutely positioned
[22:36:18] <Eviltwin> prometh: You ideally shouldn't be structuring your code that way
[22:36:18] <LordThumper> Shouldnt that stop css inheritance?
[22:36:41] <prometh> Eviltwin: i know, but i'm not using id's
[22:36:42] <Cork> prometh: best is by adding a common class name for them all
[22:36:42] <Eviltwin> You should use classes (exact matches) to indicate similar qualities
[22:36:42] <prometh> and the template won't change
[22:36:52] <Eviltwin> Like class="step"
[22:37:00] <Eviltwin> Or class="step step1" if necessary
[22:37:11] <prometh> i don't like how that looks,t hough :)
[22:37:12] <Cork> LordThumper: no
[22:37:31] <Cork> LordThumper: css inheritence only cares about parent > child >*
[22:37:43] <prometh> so it's not possible to do what i'm hoping for?
[22:38:01] <prometh> $(this).closest("div.step1, div.step2, div.step3"); // is all i can think of
[22:38:07] <Cork> prometh: it is, but it will be slow as the selector would have to do a LOT of extra work
[22:38:21] <prometh> how slow? adn might i see an example, even if i never use it?
[22:38:50] <eddiemonge> prometh: why do you like fighting with us?
[22:38:55] <LordThumper> I see, ok font-size kinda fixed the issue
[22:38:58] <prometh> i like learning too
[22:39:08] <Cork> prometh: one min
[22:39:15] <prometh> thanks :)
[22:39:27] <Eviltwin> One thing to learn about presentation and layout
[22:39:37] <Cork> oh.. lovely... api.jquery.com is down -_-'
[22:39:38] <Eviltwin> It's not about how pretty the source code is, it's about how well it presents
[22:39:46] <prometh> it presents very well
[22:40:20] <prometh> fixed up all the animation too... had to do it all manually
[22:40:39] <prometh> couldn't use height:auto, etc
[22:41:31] <LordThumper> I like jQueryUI, but I guess I need to search for a plugin
[22:41:51] <gloomer> for what LordThumper
[22:42:05] <LordThumper> Will spend too much time modififying code, might as well write what i need
[22:42:09] <prometh> plugins are ofte useless, imho
[22:42:14] <prometh> jquery does pretty well everything
[22:42:15] <LordThumper> I just need a Country drop down box
[22:42:19] <prometh> and jqueryUI has ugly effects
[22:42:21] <LordThumper> with autocomplete
[22:42:28] <LordThumper> and flags as background-image
[22:42:56] <prometh> aye.. that's a lot of leg work
[22:43:03] <prometh> gravity forms for wordpress is awesome
[22:43:17] <snover> jQuery does pretty well DOM manipulation and AJAX and thats about it
[22:43:24] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: why cant you use jquui for that?
[22:43:29] <prometh> snover: what else do you need 99% of the time?
[22:43:45] <snover> modules? application structure?
[22:43:48] <snover> widgets?
[22:43:49] <LordThumper> eddiemonge: I can, however got plenty of problems...
[22:43:55] <prometh> i never need that stuff
[22:44:03] <snover> I bet your code is a joy :)
[22:44:08] <prometh> i like creating my own things though... so they're cooler
[22:44:10] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: like ?
[22:44:17] <eddiemonge> snover: it really is
[22:44:20] <prometh> yeah, i write good code
[22:44:23] <eddiemonge> you should have seen it
[22:44:25] <LordThumper> Widget scale is not right.. need to fix it manually with font-size overrides
[22:44:52] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: are you sure thats the correct answer?
[22:45:08] <LordThumper> Not really, think it was suggested to me before
[22:45:09] <prometh> eddiemonge would take cleaner code over good presentation
[22:45:25] <prometh> sometimes, a little spaghetti is the only way to do something cool
[22:45:26] <LordThumper> Got any ideas?
[22:45:37] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ LordThumper
[22:45:38] <bot-t> LordThumper, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:46:20] <LordThumper> eddiemonge: Would like too, but it really is a copy-paste of http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[22:46:47] <eddiemonge> prometh: id take cleaner code over scary code that adds an insignificant amount of visual sugar that most people would never even notice
[22:46:51] <Cork> prometh: http://jsfiddle.net/5a3hK/
[22:46:58] <prometh> they notice
[22:47:06] <prometh> but you're a coder, not a marketing guy
[22:47:21] <eddiemonge> are you sure about that?
[22:47:30] <prometh> eddiemonge: yes, it's what i sense from your words
[22:47:50] <prometh> Cork: cool.... thank you... i'd hoped jquery had something for this that'd be simpler... i think i'll go with the basic way :)
[22:47:53] <eddiemonge> about 90% sure youve never seen my resume. but whatevers
[22:48:12] <prometh> resumes are not portfolios
[22:48:15] <Cork> prometh: it doesn't have it, cause you shouldn't be doing it that way
[22:48:38] <prometh> Cork: well.. i have a function applied to a group of <button>s
[22:48:59] <prometh> so, i need to know which one was clicked... and i don't wanna add more classes
[22:49:42] <Cork> why don't you just check this?
[22:50:06] <eddiemonge> prometh: it is if you are doing it right
[22:50:19] <Cork> prometh: and about your spageti code, no spageri code is never needed
[22:50:35] <prometh> if you're doing advanced animation it is
[22:50:37] <Cork> its only an excuse for not planing your code structure
[22:50:41] <Cork> no
[22:51:02] <prometh> advanced, nested animation.. you gotta do things manually
[22:51:08] <prometh> height:auto won't work
[22:51:20] <Cork> sure, but that doesn't mean you have to have it as spageri code
[22:51:39] <prometh> not full on spaghetti.. but it gets longer and messier than a 1-or-2 liner
[22:51:58] <Cork> prometh: thats just it; abstract it
[22:52:00] <snover> prometh has obviously never heard of things like promises
[22:52:10] <snover> or aspecting
[22:52:15] <Cork> use wrapping code to generalize the code, and make it easier to follow
[22:52:16] <prometh> Cork: that can only go so far/deep.. not every animation is the same
[22:52:24] <Cork> it can
[22:52:47] <snover> anyway cork have fun beating that dead horse
[22:52:57] <prometh> dick.
[22:53:10] <Cork> prometh: not really
[22:53:17] <eddiemonge> if multiple people think the same ..... maybe its true
[22:53:18] <Cork> he's a nice guy
[22:53:42] <prometh> if i interpreted what he meant correctly, then he just was
[22:54:07] <Cork> prometh: coming and proclaming that messy code is a must, will make ppl a bit upset
[22:54:15] <eddiemonge> no, snover can be a dick but he is usually right
[22:54:24] <prometh> sometimes things get a little messy
[22:54:25] <Cork> cause many end up spending A LOT of time crying over projects with code like that
[22:54:26] <prometh> it happens
[22:54:27] <Cork> and it SUCKS
[22:54:34] <prometh> nah, i don't write shit code
[22:54:39] <prometh> i end up with projects like that all the time
[22:54:42] <prometh> too
[22:54:58] <Cork> if your code becomes messy, and you can't grasp what it does at a glance; it is
[22:55:24] <prometh> then i'd have to say that you've never written complex animation :P
[22:55:37] <Cork> willingness to spend the time to write the code right, is another matter

[22:55:42] <LordThumper> This is it
[22:55:46] <slocate> hi, I know $('li.a'); selects  <li class="a"></li> but would is also selct <li class="premium a"></li>?
[22:55:47] <Cork> but just don't say its not posible, cause thats plain wrong
[22:55:55] <Eviltwin> slocate: Yes
[22:56:13] <prometh> sometimes, as much as code has been cleaned up, cannot be cleaned up any more and is still somewhat messy
[22:56:15] <slocate> Eviltwin how come??
[22:56:23] <Eviltwin> slocate: Because that's how classes work
[22:56:25] <LordThumper> 184px compared to 116px on the jQueryUI demo
[22:56:27] <Eviltwin> DEAL WITH IT
[22:56:31] <Cork> slocate: it selects all elements with nodeName 'li' and a class 'a'
[22:56:43] <Cork> slocate: as soon as both are fullfild it matches
[22:57:14] <slocate> but the latter class is 'premium a'
[22:57:23] <Cork> no
[22:57:27] <Cork> its premium AND a
[22:57:27] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: why are you including two different css?
[22:57:42] <slocate> :o
[22:58:00] <LordThumper> One is the jQueryUI
[22:58:07] <LordThumper> the other just for the widget i think...
[22:58:17] <LordThumper> the .combobox widget
[22:58:22] <Eviltwin> slocate: No, classes are separated by spaces
[22:58:32] <Eviltwin> slocate: That element has two classes, one is "premium" and one is "a"
[22:58:42] <Eviltwin> If you want it to be one class, you have to use a different separator
[22:58:43] <slocate> got it
[22:59:09] <slocate> Eviltwin is that a css or jquery rule?
[22:59:28] <Eviltwin> That's a "the whole internet" rule
[22:59:31] <prometh> Cork: i just found a way to do the regex thing with css3:   $(this).closest("div[class^=step]")
[22:59:45] <Eviltwin> prometh: Those are slower than normal class selectors
[22:59:47] <Eviltwin> Be warned
[22:59:50] <eddiemonge> that is incredbily slow
[23:00:12] <prometh> yeah, but the string is already being processed with regex
[23:00:14] <prometh> if it can accept them.
[23:00:20] <Cork> prometh: won't work
[23:00:23] <prometh> ?
[23:00:23] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: one of them is applying font-size: 1.1em
[23:00:32] <Cork> <div class="something step1"> won't match
[23:00:39] <prometh> aye
[23:00:39] <prometh> thanks
[23:01:41] <LordThumper> eddiemonge: In the .css file you mean?
[23:01:57] <LordThumper> That's the default jQueryUI css file
[23:02:59] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: yes in there
[23:03:26] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/qV8Dn/2/
[23:04:52] <LordThumper> Thanks :)
[23:05:00] <LordThumper> Did you apply the css rule to body specifically?
[23:05:08] <LordThumper> Or should I do that to every ancestor?
[23:05:30] <LordThumper> Well I can try that pretty quickly
[23:06:26] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: normally your page would have a font normalizer
[23:07:04] <LordThumper> ye reset.css... let me check what it is doing to font...
[23:09:03] <LordThumper> font-size: 100%...
[23:35:35] <srj55> can anyone recommend a good jquery tab plugin:?
[23:35:43] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI tabs
[23:37:18] <wltoriginal> Hi everyone. I can't understand what a jquery object is. i.e when i say $('div'), is the object that is returned an array with jquery enhanced prototype methods?
[23:37:52] <Eviltwin> The object that is returned is called "array-ish" or "array-like"
[23:38:04] <Eviltwin> It's not of type Array, it's of type Object
[23:38:13] <wltoriginal> What is the difference?
[23:38:17] <Eviltwin> But it has a lot of properties like an Array
[23:38:22] <Eviltwin> i.e. the indexed numbering of elements
[23:38:32] <Eviltwin> And things like .length and .slice
[23:38:37] <wltoriginal> Yeah, that's what is confusing me.
[23:38:40] <Cork> actually it is a plain array with added function on it
[23:38:43] <Eviltwin> Which causes many browsers to render it like an array
[23:38:51] <Eviltwin> However if you do things like .length = 0
[23:38:56] <Eviltwin> You'll see the elements remain
[23:39:02] <Eviltwin> Whereas with a normal array, they all get dumped
[23:40:04] <wltoriginal> Eviltwin, how do they manage to access array elements with []?
[23:40:19] <wltoriginal> (on the jquery object)
[23:40:21] <Eviltwin> ?object @ wltoriginal
[23:40:21] <bot-t> wltoriginal, object.foo === object["foo"]
[23:41:01] <wltoriginal> Thanks guys. I finally understand!
[23:50:07] <wltoriginal> When I type in new Object in firebug, I get:    Object{}            as the output.
[23:50:36] <Eviltwin> Try { "length": 0, "slice": function(){} }
[23:51:58] <Eviltwin> Err
[23:52:01] <Eviltwin> Try { "length": 0, "splice": function(){} }
[23:52:13] <wltoriginal> When I type in new Array in firebug, I get [] as the output. When I type in $('a') I get [] as the output.  I'm confused again.
[23:52:25] <Eviltwin> Try { "length": 0, "splice": function(){} } in Firebug
[23:52:50] <wltoriginal> new Object({ "length": 0, "slice": function(){} }) gives:   Object { length=0, slice=function()}
[23:53:16] <Eviltwin> That's...not what I said
[23:53:23] <Eviltwin> Drop the new Object
[23:53:30] <Eviltwin> Just literally what I typed
[23:53:34] <Eviltwin> And with splice, not slice
[23:54:00] <wltoriginal> SyntaxError: invalid label
[23:54:02] <wltoriginal> [Break On This Error] 	
[23:54:06] <wltoriginal> { "length": 0, "splice": function(){} }
[23:54:08] <Eviltwin> Oh, lame
[23:54:10] <Eviltwin> Throw it in parens then
[23:54:25] <Eviltwin> Or I guess you can do the new Object thing but that actually constructs two objects
[23:55:20] <wltoriginal> Hey, that worked.  Can you maybe tell me why it constructs two objects with new Object?
[23:55:54] <wltoriginal> is the parameter evaluated first, and then the new object is created?
[23:56:58] <wltoriginal> Anyway, thanks a lot Eviltwin!
