[00:00:14] <ryanaz> superchu:  I bet he forgot $(document).ready
[00:00:20] <ryanaz> his code doesn't have it
[00:00:24] <atodorovic> <-- bear with me plz, totally new to jquery here :(
[00:01:14] <superchu> atodorovic: you need to wrap your code inside $(document).ready(function(){ /* Code here */ });
[00:01:26] <superchu> or $(function(){ /* Code here */ });
[00:01:30] <coldhead> atodorovic: $(document), not $('document')
[00:02:07] <atodorovic> coldhead: no change :(
[00:02:24] <azbyin> ajax -> fill div -> $("div:first").animate({left : "+=0"}, 500, function(){   /* table is ready, parse and update links now */ });
[00:02:35] <azbyin> assuming the table does not exist in the original page
[00:02:57] <atodorovic> azbyin: it doesnt exist when the page is loaded
[00:03:00] <azbyin> you can change the 500 to whatever value you want. or better yet, have a callback triggered once the table is ready
[00:03:09] <azbyin> so what i said applies
[00:03:44] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  something to bear in mind is that things don't execute in order that you have them.  They all execute asynchronously.  So it doesn't matter if you have the table draw in the code before what you want to do with the tabl
[00:04:09] <atodorovic> azbyin: sorry way over my head at this time :( literally started with all this 10 hours ago :(
[00:05:21] <atodorovic> ryanaz: that I've grasped, but probably a silly question how would i rewrite the function to utilize $(document).ready, and still have the jquery triggered on checkbox click?
[00:06:39] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  I don't really know what you're trying to do ‚Ä¶. but what I would do is write a function that is triggered every time you check a box..
[00:07:04] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  so you draw the page, do whatever you need to do .. and then attach a function with the click() function to the buttons.
[00:07:29] <coldhead> that's good keeping it simple, ryanaz
[00:07:56] <atodorovic> can the click be assigned to each of the checkboxes?
[00:08:19] <anu> Hi al, i am developing a jquery mobile application. I am adding webpage to an iframe in one of the virtual pages in the mobile application by script. But there occurs an error " Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with url # from the url #.Domains, protocols and ports must match.". Is it because loading webpage in different virtual page? help me plz
[00:08:25] <ryanaz> yah ‚Ä¶  $([id^=whatever]) ‚Ä¶
[00:08:51] <ryanaz> atodorovic: you're learning how to assign names to things right with the id tag?
[00:09:23] <ryanaz> atodorovic: the $([id^= ‚Ä¶. ]).click( .. );
[00:09:24] <atodorovic> well I've done that already, each checkbox has it's unique id / name already
[00:09:30] <atodorovic> yup
[00:09:47] <coldhead> anu: iframes are a world of pain, especially for mobile
[00:09:54] <ryanaz> coldhead:  he's using numbers for his id names.. is that valid?
[00:10:20] <ryanaz> id=1
[00:10:24] <ryanaz> is that valid?
[00:10:50] <coldhead> nope
[00:10:57] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  why don't you use more descriptive names?  i've been using names for things i want actions and descriptive tagging..
[00:10:59] <coldhead> not in older browsers anyway
[00:11:07] <coldhead> IDs can't start with a digit
[00:11:14] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  For example :   id=checkbox_1
[00:11:30] <ryanaz> then you can search for all your checkboxes and assign your click to it easily ‚Ä¶
[00:11:33] <atodorovic> ok, lemme fix that real quick
[00:11:46] <ryanaz> atodorovic:  $([id^=checkbox_]).click( ‚Ä¶ ) ;
[00:11:56] <anu> coldhead : Do you have any idea about the reason for that error?
[00:12:07] * tw2113 needs to take more advantage of selectors instead of classes/ids
[00:12:09] <tw2113> at least in css
[00:13:58] <atodorovic> ok changed the id's, they're now using checkbox_ in front of each recordID
[00:14:35] <ryanaz> ok and ?
[00:14:43] <ryanaz> did you update the fiddle?
[00:17:23] <coldhead> anu: if the iframe is loading content from another domain then the browser gets all security conscious and makes your life hard
[00:17:40] <coldhead> and even if the content is from the same domain its still awful
[00:17:44] <coldhead> i just avoid using iframes
[00:17:48] <coldhead> they ruin everything
[00:17:51] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[00:19:15] <tw2113> iframes make things harder than a huge dose of viagra
[00:21:47] <anu> coldhead ; Is there solution for that?
[00:25:46] <coldhead> anu: dont use iframes
[00:26:06] <coldhead> or if you must, spend a lot of time researching and don't expect quick magic fixes from IRC
[00:26:08] <coldhead> they are HARD
[00:26:14] <ryanaz> was iframes just a bad idea?  i don't see any use for it.
[00:26:37] <bnm> anu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[00:26:38] <coldhead> they're good at making remote content appear to be in the same page
[00:26:59] <coldhead> they're bad at letting JS play with that content
[00:27:08] <bnm> there are ways to escape in certain situations, maybe a google search would hit some
[00:27:11] <coldhead> and they're mostly used for banner ads

[00:50:12] <anu> coldhead: is there any alternetive solution for iframe?
[00:51:24] <exu_> ?
[00:54:04] <coldhead> anu: include the content in the page itself, not via an iframe
[01:01:10] * tw2113 now has a better understanding of how lightbox plugins handle captions via alt tags for example
[01:01:42] <tw2113> attr() usage
[01:02:41] <NET||abuse> hi jq folks,
[01:03:00] <coldhead> hallo
[01:03:55] <NET||abuse> having an annoyance with stop(). i have a simle slideDown on mouseenter and slideup on mousleave, if I don't use jumptoend it doesn't animate the slideup if i mouse out quickly
[01:04:27] <nestappucino> hello
[01:04:31] <NET||abuse> if i do use jumptoend true, it flashes to full height and slide's up and it looks jerky and horrible.
[01:05:19] <NET||abuse> is there a way to get the animation to run the oposite from the state it's reached from the previous animation somehow?
[01:08:23] <ColKurtz> NET||abuse maybe using the hoverIntent plugin
[01:08:26] <ColKurtz> would help you
[01:08:57] <coldhead> i agree, it's simpler to make the event handlers only fire when you want than it is to try to reverse the animation
[01:09:12] <coldhead> hoverintent or ben alman's debounce
[01:09:15] <coldhead> something like that
[01:09:33] <NET||abuse> hmm, will go read up on those
[01:09:37] <NET||abuse> thanks for that.
[01:09:48] <NET||abuse> i prefer finding native solutions rather than installing MORE code
[01:10:19] <coldhead> those are both pretty small, you can just steal their logic and apply it to your own code
[01:11:16] <NET||abuse> yep, that would be pererable
[01:11:34] <NET||abuse> i'll go see if i can grok that code
[01:18:36] <Amit> hi
[01:19:22] <Guest51272> hi i m new in jquery .can any one help me
[01:19:41] <tw2113> not until you state what you need help with
[01:20:14] <Guest51272> in animation part
[01:21:12] <anu> bnm: thanks..gona try it
[01:24:16] <miChou> hi there :)
[01:24:25] <miChou> anyone can help me with a quick pointer? :)
[01:25:36] <miChou> I'm trying to get an idea how jQuery's .css() method works
[01:25:49] <miChou> but I have some trouble finding it in the source tree
[01:25:54] <anu> coldhead : i want external webpages in the content. that is why i tried to use iframe
[01:26:42] <faraway> miChou: what do you want to know about .css() ?
[01:27:08] <miChou> I'm trying to get an idea how PrefixFree jQuery plugin works
[01:27:18] <miChou> i think it's doing something not right, but i'm not 100% sure
[01:28:17] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[01:29:33] <faraway> miChou: you mean the script that allows you to write prefix free css files ?
[01:30:58] <faraway> miChou: if yes, this script only works, if the sytlesheet is loaded form the same domain
[01:31:40] <coldhead> anu: you might be able to use the server to load the relevant content from the external site and include it in your page
[01:32:06] <coldhead> anu: if you're only worried about seeing the error message in the console and the iframes are otherwise working for you, just ignore it
[01:32:18] <coldhead> lots of "proper" sites have the same "error"
[01:32:41] <Nobita> hi, I'm trying to create a similar site to https://www.airbnb.com/ in D7.x where I need bit help regarding their DataBase, I mean how can I get & also upload all the available location from the world; since you can try their search its displaying all auto-complete or similar values, where I can get those
[01:33:16] <miChou> faraway: it has nothing to do with that.. it breaks when changing the CSS on an element via jQuery, such as $('#div').css('flex', 'foo');
[01:33:35] <hrwath> D7.x?
[01:38:01] <faraway> miChou: without seeing a code example (e.g. on jsfiddle) its would be more like guessing then really helping ;)
[01:38:27] <miChou> faraway: ok, i'll come up with something clearer :)
[01:38:51] <klj613> the second param $('selector', 'selector') is the parent yes? e.g. $('label', '.form-2') would target labels inside .form-2 ?
[01:40:01] <faraway> klj613: imho it is not the parent but the context of the search (the root the is used instead of the document)
[01:40:19] <faraway>  (the root that is ‚Ä¶ )
[01:40:54] <tw2113> Nobita something like this http://papermashup.com/jquery-php-ajax-autosuggest/
[01:41:22] <klj613> faraway, yes thats what i meant.
[01:41:26] <klj613> thanks
[01:44:27] <Nobita> tw2113: thanks, but that's not what I need
[01:44:33] <Nobita> tw2113: a try to you, I want you to search a small county which is not at all famous in your town/country on AirBNB; there you will find that they are having that stuff also
[01:44:41] <Nobita> is it possible to have all over worlds geographic data like of Google map onto one place, tw2113 ?
[01:45:33] <tw2113> apparently you didn't get the general idea
[01:45:45] <tw2113> have a source of information, whatever it may be
[01:45:57] <tw2113> and then use ajax to retrieve suggestions based on what's been typed
[01:46:08] <tw2113> much like the example i linked you
[01:46:24] <tw2113> yours is just a broader scope and need a lot more in the source location
[01:46:25] <Nobita> tw2113: ok
[02:30:51] <noaXess> hey all
[02:33:16] <noaXess> i call a js function onclick, within this js function i call $.ajax() to a php script that creates a export of table data and returns php header() to directly download the needed data.. but over the onclick event and the $.ajax() call nothing will be dowwnloaded... here is my code, js: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1107862/ , php: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1107864/
[02:33:20] <noaXess> any idea, hint?
[02:33:47] <noaXess> i don't want direct call the php script with the click on the icon, i want call it over $.ajax..
[02:34:47] <juha_> noaXess: where is that js function called?
[02:34:47] <noaXess> idea: onclick data will be exported as xls and download should start
[02:34:51] <Lucky--> noaXess: why waste the time converting it to excel, why not just return it as a json
[02:34:54] <Lucky--> and display it as such
[02:35:07] <noaXess> Lucky--: customer need/WANTS xls
[02:35:26] <noaXess> juha_: i call the js function with a onclick event on a icon
[02:35:50] <NodeX> noaXess : you will need to populate an iframe to download it
[02:35:51] <Lucky--> noaXess: just iframe it
[02:35:52] <juha_> noaXess: put some more code up
[02:35:57] <Lucky--> NodeX: lol
[02:35:58] <Lucky--> :-)
[02:36:04] <NodeX> header() is passed when the page renders
[02:36:18] <adiii> Hi, Which is a good jquery plugin for scrollbar... which has IE7+ support
[02:36:41] <noaXess> NodeX: where to populate the iframe? within the php function?
[02:37:04] <Lucky--> noaXess: you could use a jquery selector
[02:37:11] <Lucky--> and .attr('src', 'url');
[02:37:29] <NodeX> yes, you click / submit your form to a target which is set to the location of the PHP script
[02:37:33] <noaXess> juha_: no more code.. just the code of the icon with onclick even.. <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="exportscript(id)">.. icon.. </a>
[02:37:47] <NodeX> you dont even need onclick
[02:38:04] <noaXess> NodeX: you mean i can call the php script directls
[02:38:08] <Lucky--> yes
[02:38:08] <noaXess> directly
[02:38:16] <NodeX> ^^
[02:38:26] <noaXess> but.. hm. if i don't want it and call it over ajax? no way?
[02:38:48] <NodeX> <a target="your-frame" href="/your.php?foo=bar">Click to download</a>
[02:38:56] <NodeX> not a chance
[02:39:02] <noaXess> i want hide the php call.. normally i allow only calling some php script if it s a XMLHttpRequest
[02:39:13] <Lucky--> iframe loads in different thread
[02:39:28] <Lucky--> doesnt block
[02:40:09] <NodeX> noaXess : you cannot get around this
[02:40:20] <juha_> noaXess: please don't use onclick..
[02:40:35] <Lucky--> ^
[02:40:52] <Lucky--> $("#id").click(function(){});
[02:40:53] <Lucky--> if you must
[02:41:02] <noaXess> juha_: other question.. how do you open a jquery dialog to edit some data?
[02:41:16] <NodeX> well possible you could change the src of the iframe after an ajax request but I dont know how cross browser that would be
[02:41:20] <noaXess> aha... with the $.click method.. ok
[02:41:20] <juha_> noaXess: dialog is a plugin?
[02:41:29] <Lucky--> NodeX: works fine, i use it for some of my stuff
[02:41:30] <noaXess> juha_: jquery-ui
[02:41:43] <NodeX> it's a waste of a call imo
[02:41:49] <juha_> noaXess: just wrap it to the .click() function
[02:42:01] <noaXess> juha_: i see... ok.. thanks
[02:42:12] <noaXess> NodeX: so call the php directly is here the solution.. ok..
[02:42:15] <Lucky--> actually no i dont
[02:42:15] <Lucky--> :-)
[02:42:25] <NodeX> noaXess : yes
[02:42:34] <adiii> noaXess, dialog.open()
[02:42:39] <NodeX> it wont leave the page because the target is an Iframe ..
[02:42:42] <adiii> will open the dialog..
[02:42:59] <noaXess> adiii: i know.. but... with a .onclick() event ;)
[02:43:45] <adiii> create a anonymous function which calls dialog.open() and pass it is a param to onclick handler
[02:44:19] <havocologe> i have a problem, that feels somewhat strange to me. i use ajax to get a html-snippet(within document.ready()). If i try to use old.replaceWith(new) then it gets replaced, but an <a> tag that is within new is "filtered"
[02:44:55] <Lucky--> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/421601/Droptiles-Metro-style-Live-Tiles-powered-Web-Dashb
[02:45:12] <Lucky--> new.html() ?
[02:45:24] <Lucky--> old.replaceWith(new.html());
[02:45:26] <Lucky--> try that
[02:45:46] <adiii> Guys any experience with a good jquery scroll plugin ... which can give ie7+ support..
[02:46:23] <adiii> a lightweight and css customizable one...
[02:52:13] <havocologe> Lucky--: i use responseTExt because the ajax response is pure html
[02:54:11] <tocka> Hey guys
[02:56:59] <tocka> i have this function, when I check the radio button total increases but when I select something it doesnt do anything
[02:57:03] <tocka> The price stays the same
[02:57:09] <tocka> Whats the issue?
[02:57:09] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/hWV8c/
[02:57:17] <tocka> Or am I missing something?
[02:58:42] <astropirate> Anyone have an idea for a cool jquery plugin  or UI widget? I'm taking requests :)
[03:00:12] <astropirate> feel free to PM me
[03:01:09] <Guest74057> tocka => not $(this).attr("value"); do => $(this).val()
[03:01:50] <tocka> Guest74057 nvm Im sorted :)
[03:01:52] <tocka> thanks tho
[03:09:58] <havocologe> if i run my ajax request by hand, everything behaves fine.
[03:10:48] <SoleSoul> Hi! I'm thinking about using a tabbed view, but with no tab headers. I want to switch between the tabs with a drop down list. Is it possible with jQuery tabs? should I use something else?
[03:17:28] <e-anima> i am getting insane with inArray. i am iterating through an object key value and then do if(jQuery.inArray(key, "foo")) { alert("found homepage"); } as soon as i replace "foo" by an array like var homepage_array = ["homepage", "website", "site", "url"]; its TRUE for every single item in the object.
[03:24:21] <e-anima> inArray does not work if the key is from n object...could that be?
[03:44:10] <sahbeewah> inArray returns an index
[03:44:23] <sahbeewah> -1 if not found, which equates to true
[03:47:55] <amitprakash> given a selector var x = $('.className') .. how can I find $('.someClass') inside x ?
[03:48:16] <amitprakash> i.e. $('.className .someClass')
[03:48:25] <sahbeewah> x.find('.someClass')
[03:48:57] <amitprakash> sahbeewah, thanks
[03:49:26] <EnginA> I'm making a "designer" wher users drag-drops widgets from a toolbox to a canvas. what is the easiest way for this ? i.e. when I just append the helper to target, then the toolbox item seems no longer draggable
[03:53:41] <sahbeewah> do you have an example
[03:53:47] <sahbeewah> are you cloning it?
[03:54:15] <EnginA> I've tried helper: 'clone' and a function(){return $('<div>helper</div>');}
[03:54:40] <EnginA> after a successful drop, the helper is placed on the target and the source is no more draggable
[03:55:03] <EnginA> what i basically want is to, drag to source to the target as many time as i want... and each time the helper will be appended and positioned in the target
[03:56:28] <sahbeewah> iirc if you clone it you should be able to duplicate the source indefinitely
[03:56:53] <sahbeewah> can you jsfiddle it
[03:57:49] <svnlto> hey, im getting a js error in IE8 when trying to set and attribute
[03:58:09] <svnlto> says 'command is not supported'
[03:58:25] <svnlto> any pointers
[03:58:27] <svnlto> ?
[03:59:16] <sahbeewah> how are you doing it
[04:02:13] <amitprakash> Since live is now deprecated, how can I bind a function to an event on a object which will be generated dynamically
[04:02:32] <sahbeewah> ?on
[04:02:33] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:03:04] <amitprakash> sahbeewah, on does not work on elements that are generated dynamically
[04:03:23] <sahbeewah> sure it does
[04:03:43] <sahbeewah> you apply it to a static parent element
[04:03:43] <amitprakash> sec.. will exemplify
[04:03:59] <amitprakash> sahbeewah, isn't that more complicated than live
[04:04:19] <sahbeewah> $('#always_on_page').on('click', '.dynamically_added_element', function() { ...
[04:04:35] <amitprakash> Yeah.. but why this way than live?
[04:05:14] <sahbeewah> live is equivalent to an unoptimized version of $(body).on(event, element, ...)
[04:05:27] <sahbeewah> which means all clicks to the body are caught
[04:05:37] <sahbeewah> which makes it inefficient and slow
[04:05:50] <amitprakash> Ah ok
[04:05:54] <amitprakash> makes sense then
[04:16:11] <majd> Hey #jquery - i am using a jquery plugin that does ajax file uploads to my python backend. The upload happens correctly, and some JSON is returned. The uploader has an onComplete function that does something based on the success/failure of the upload. Here's my code: http://dpaste.org/Qf728/
[04:16:58] <majd> the problem is that the if(responseJSON.success) check fails if there are any ' or " in the html returned
[04:17:23] <majd> e.g. if there are ids or classes to the elements
[04:17:25] <blackspotwiggins> majd, escape it properly
[04:17:40] <blackspotwiggins> also, you should use status codes to indicate success
[04:17:48] <blackspotwiggins> meaning, if it fails, dont return 200
[04:18:05] <majd> blackspotwiggins: it is escaped properly - not in the example because i manipulated it, but it is...
[04:19:20] <blackspotwiggins> if it is escaped, it should work then.
[04:19:31] <majd> blackspotwiggins: all the " in the response are escaped like so \"
[04:21:24] <sahbeewah> console.log the responseJSON
[04:28:37] <majd> sahbeewah: hmmm - that reveals a problem - responseJSON has non of the attributes i expect (success, html, etc...)
[04:29:42] <sahbeewah> that may possibly be a problem
[04:30:02] <blackspotwiggins> majd, validate your json
[04:30:07] <blackspotwiggins> jsonlint.com iirc
[04:30:57] <majd> blackspotwiggins: i'm pretty sure the json is valid, since it's serialized using Django's json serializer...
[04:32:44] <sahbeewah> print the dict prior to the return and see why it's not returning
[04:33:29] <blackspotwiggins> majd, well, it doesnt work right?
[04:33:51] <anu> Hi al, is it possible to append external webpage to a div via script?
[04:33:54] <jpic> hi all, is it possible to bind a callback in case an element is cloned ?
[04:38:50] <ecthiender> anu, yes it could be possible
[04:39:21] <ecthiender> anu, you can use ajax to get contents of a page, parse it if necessary and append it to a div.
[04:42:27] <anu> ecthiender : Actually, I want load websites inside div. Is it possible?
[04:44:23] <ecthiender> anu, no you can't load a functional website inside a div :) you can parse its content and load the content. alternatively you can load a website inside an iframe.
[04:44:28] <tocka> I wanted to ask, how can I get the response in a variable out of this?
[04:44:38] <tocka> I want to do like if response == true {}
[04:44:45] <tocka> then some other action
[04:46:53] <anu> ecthiender : i tried i frame. but it is for mobile application. iframe not recommented for mobile applications. right? Anyother alternatives?
[04:47:25] <ecthiender> anu, hmm. well I dont know much about mobile applications.
[04:47:56] <ecthiender> anu, search the web. maybe you'll find an alternative. or maybe someone else in this channel can answer you.
[04:49:04] <anu> ecthiender : ok
[04:49:13] <ecthiender> anu, can you tell me where did you read that iframe is not recommended for mobile apps?
[04:52:09] <anu> ecthiender : http://forums.asp.net/t/1684277.aspx/1
[04:52:30] <ecthiender> anu, this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11205400/load-page-to-a-div-jquery-mobile?rq=1

[04:57:28] <Chris_CC> hi guys having a problem with executing a php file within my jquery ... i've tried a few different ways but still nothing ... any ideas? http://pastebin.com/xLCCNNfX
[05:00:08] <ablomen> Chris_CC, use jQuery.get or jQuery.ajax instead of your own XMLHttpRequest, see the docs for more info
[05:00:14] <ecthiender> Chris_CC, what is your problem exactly? And if you are using jquery why dont use the $.ajax() method. then you dont have to do ugly XMLHttpRequest stuff.
[05:00:31] <Chris_CC> thanks will try them
[05:00:55] <Chris_CC> I'm v new to all this so jsut picked up something fromt he net and it worked so kept it for something else :P
[05:16:28] <jpic> hi all, is it possible to bind a callback for when an attribute (id) changes on an element ?
[05:16:39] <quicksilver> no.
[05:16:52] <quicksilver> or at least, not effectively and portably.
[05:17:00] <quicksilver> DOM change events exist but browsers do not support them well.
[05:17:52] <jpic> thanks for answering
[05:18:15] <Chris_CC> ablomen: Thanks that got it working for me .. one more question though ... if i have a div id that is created and called <div id="expand_shout<?= $shout_id ?>"> .. how do i call that to be changed?  .. i have this but it won't work                 $('#expand_shout'+shout_id).html(data);
[05:20:19] <ecthiender> Chris_CC, thats probably because the element doesnt exist. try logging this $('#expand_shout'+shout_id) to console and see what it returns.
[05:21:55] <Chris_CC> ecthiender: console??? I don;t have any console :S
[05:22:31] <ecthiender> Chris_CC, what browser do you use?
[05:22:36] <Chris_CC> chrome
[05:22:52] <ecthiender> Chris_CC, cool :) that has console.
[05:23:12] <Chris_CC> ecthiender:  oo 1 sec then ^^
[05:23:24] <pflock> does IE interpret .animate the right way?
[05:24:23] <ecthiender> Chris_CC, open the developer tools(probably F12). that has a console tab, you can run JS in it.
[05:24:55] <jpic> quicksilver: so there isn't really a clean solution for this problem ? http://jsfiddle.net/5uXFS/13/
[05:25:22] <jpic> i have updated a comment here: http://jsfiddle.net/5uXFS/14/
[05:25:25] <Chris_CC> ecthiender: thanks, says that the "shout_id" is not defined :/ ... http://pastebin.com/mjUY12rH
[05:25:58] <Frippuz> How can I find rows in a table where the row contains an empty <td>-tag?
[05:27:28] <quicksilver> jpic: well, is it really important you use "id" for that?
[05:27:36] <quicksilver> you could use jquery.data as a basis for a registry
[05:27:41] <quicksilver> and that is preserved over ID changes.
[05:27:59] <quicksilver> and works equally for elements with no ID...
[05:28:21] <jpic> if i understand correctly, jquery.data relies on data-* attributes, would that support an object instance ?
[05:30:09] <jpic> your solution works well on strings that's for sure: http://jsfiddle.net/5uXFS/15/
[05:30:20] <blackspotwiggins> jpic, you can use .data() on anything
[05:30:43] <blackspotwiggins> if reads data- attributes if the key is not present
[05:30:47] <jpic> apparently it does, yay you made my days !!!
[05:31:05] <pachet> jpic: it doesnt *rely* on the data- attributes on the given element
[05:31:27] <pachet> it just does you the favor of pulling them into the internal object at that namespace if those attributes are present
[05:31:45] <jpic> fantastic
[05:32:43] <jpic> one question thought, if an element is cloned, will it's data be cloned or will references be kept ?
[05:34:07] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I have a function that appends a bunch of HTML. I now want events for these new HTML elements, but to put these events inside of the function I'm not given access the scope of variables I need without being ridiculous. How can I put these functions in the scope of $(document).ready()? I think I use '.on' right? I never really understood that method.
[05:36:20] <quicksilver> jpic: there is a parameter to 'clone' which determines if data gets clones or not
[05:36:20] <jpic> according to my tests (http://jsfiddle.net/5uXFS/31/) data is not cloned when an element is cloned
[05:36:30] <pachet> jpic: no, its not cloned
[05:36:37] <pachet> jpic: arrays and objects are shared between cloned elements
[05:36:52] <jpic> true, sorry
[05:37:26] <blackspotwiggins> jpic, if you clone with .clone(true), data and events are cloned as well
[05:39:56] <pachet> blackspotwiggins: that's not what he's asking exactly
[05:40:19] <pachet> he's asking whether .clone() does a deep copy of objects in .data for that element
[05:45:33] <Pumukel> Hi did someone know is there is a way to get the get?params of an overlay call?
[05:47:01] <testera> hi there... i need help with two things for ui slider
[05:47:21] <testera> anybody?
[05:56:06] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I have a function that creates a bunch of new HTML, and I want events for these elements however I want these events to be in $(document).ready instead of the function. Is there any way to do this? I need access to my scope of variables and avoid ridiculous pass/returns
[05:56:46] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: use event delegation
[05:56:57] <ajpiano> with .on() in the document ready function
[05:57:00] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: With .on right?
[05:57:37] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: This is what I thought I needed but I can't make sense of how to use it or how it works through the docs. Do you have any resources that will explain it to me like I'm 5 or would you mind walking me through it this once? Thanks for your help regardless!
[05:58:28] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: it works by you attach the event to a containing element, like the document itself, intead of the elements themselves
[05:58:38] <ajpiano> then, because of Event Bubbling, the events are caught in the higher container
[05:58:53] <ajpiano> so instead of doing $(".foo").on("click", function(e){});
[05:59:03] <ajpiano> you do $(document).on("click", ".foo", function() { });
[05:59:24] <ajpiano> and when the document receieves a click and the target of that click is an element with the class foo, then the handler is triggered
[05:59:32] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: I'll give it a try. Thanks!
[05:59:42] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: did you deal with that jerk from your office
[06:00:09] <DeltaHeavy|Work> He's my boss =/
[06:00:14] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Kinda
[06:00:16] <DeltaHeavy|Work> FML eh?
[06:00:26] <ajpiano> that guy *is* your boss???
[06:00:49] <DeltaHeavy|Work> My boss is his client, but I do other work for this guy MattDunbar.
[06:00:59] <ajpiano> sounds like a real winner
[06:01:34] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I wonder if he's a pathological liar sometimes lol. The shit he says is unreal.
[06:02:32] <ajpiano> pathological something for sure

[06:03:52] <eltreno> Hello, Interesting problem someone may know the answer to - I can't figure it :) I use BBCode on my website and save it RAW BBcode tags in the db, then rather then use PHP to convert it each time I send the RAW BBCode to the browser and add a BBCode class to divs with BBCode - the for EACH() bboce class div I convert the bbcode to HTML with Javascript - And it works great - EXCEPT :) I recently tried to add a [pre]  tag - it when c
[06:03:54] <eltreno> onverting it it works great in chrome/FF/IE9  but IE8 and below, removed the extra wihte space before I can get to it with the Javascript conversion, Basically innerHTML in IE has a bug that removes whitespace - any ideas out there?
[06:04:14] <Frippuz> ajpiano: thought so, but couldn't figure out how do it correctly
[06:05:06] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: The on method worked perfectly. Thanks!
[06:05:18] <ajpiano> :)
[06:06:18] <testera> is there any way that header of ui slider starts from the center of a slider
[06:06:50] <testera> and if you move slider left or right header background repeats in that way
[06:07:23] <ajpiano> testera: the first part is easy, just do .slider({value: 50})
[06:07:27] <ajpiano> or whatever half of the max is
[06:08:37] <ajpiano> the second part sounds more complex, but if you use the "slide" event from the slider you should be able to pull it off
[06:10:00] <miCSu> why can't I see the draggable element's movement if I'm not using ie in quirks mode
[06:14:01] <sahbeewah> eltreno, does the bug persist if you use jquery methods?
[06:17:38] <eltreno> sahbeewah:  such as??
[06:17:58] <majd> blackspotwiggins: just validated the json using jsonlint, and yes, it's valid
[06:18:10] <sahbeewah> .html as opposed to .innerHTML
[06:18:47] <eltreno> yes - i'm using .html
[06:19:19] <eltreno> it seems ie8 and below remove white space if it's not in pre tags from the start
[06:19:57] <Lupa> Hi, can anybody help with a situation where a piece of jquery code only works when I have alert's inside the code. I've let my self understand that when I use async ajaxcalls to web service, they might take longer to execute than the rest of the code and that's why code that depends on those queries doesn't get executed.
[06:19:58] <Lupa> And solutions are $(document).ready(function(){.. or $().live(function(){. But none of these seem to help. I have a function call which executes the function itself (queries data from db) and the jquery after that call doesn't execute without an alert.
[06:20:06] <sahbeewah> so your input is like a html string?
[06:20:14] <sahbeewah> hrms
[06:21:25] <sahbeewah> i mean bbcode string
[06:21:35] <eltreno> sahbeewah - Yes input is standard BBCode string  - I then run convert over only divs with BBCode class
[06:22:32] <eltreno> sahbeewah -  I'm thinking I may try saving bbcode first in an array - then convert - then print to page or something (it's just DAM IE8<)
[06:23:10] <sahbeewah> wouldn't it make more sense to convert it server-side
[06:24:14] <eltreno> yes except i've been trying to get the load of server - 9million page views a month and most have 20-30 BBCode fields :) - Thats why putting it on client is sweet
[06:25:19] <faraway> Lupa: for async ajax request you have the callback function you pass with the request, that will be executed as soon as the request is finished
[06:25:44] <DeltaHeavy|Work> http://decorgroupinc.com/test/arch/ Anybody know why my images aren't changing. Clicks are registering and everything and no warnings are being thrown but when I hover over any of these buttons the 'over' image doesn't change and when I click on them they don't change to the 'down' images. Everything else seems to function as intended. (xpost from #web)
[06:25:59] <Lupa> Should something like this work: somefunction(var1, var2).live(function(){ Or somefunction(var1, var2).on(function(){ .... Can you put a jquery method after a javascripti function?
[06:27:42] <faraway> Lupa: i think you should learn the basics of javascript and jquery, with some tutorials, cause i think you have no clue what you are doing ;) :P
[06:27:51] <DeltaHeavy|Work> nvm got it!
[06:28:00] <faraway> Lupa: and after that you could look at ajax requests
[06:29:51] <dethkrieg> If i have a Jquery select element saved to a variable $myVariable -- how do I output the entire html of this variable. .html() only outputs the internal tags
[06:30:15] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outerhtml yelotofu @ dethkrieg
[06:30:17] <bot-t> dethkrieg, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[06:30:30] <dethkrieg> sweet, thanks
[06:33:25] <Lupa> faraway: Yep, I'm kind of a newbie. My situtation is that my coworker did the code and is on summer vacation now. I was assigned to take it further because of a hurry situtation. Mostly I have succeeded, but this problem seems a tough nut to crack. Thanks anyway. I'll check on that callback function.
[06:35:12] <sahbeewah> eltreno, at what point does the white-space disappear
[06:36:23] <juha_> Lupa: sure you can do that if somefunction() returns jquery object
[06:37:24] <eltreno> sahbeewah: even if I alert the the content of a BBCode div using .text - without doing anything else - it's gone - IE basically removes the whitespace if PRE tag doesn't exist around it -
[06:37:44] <eltreno> html pre tag that is
[06:38:40] <dschuett> has anyone used jquery form plugin for uploading files? - It works for me, but it is REALLY slow to return the json response.
[06:38:41] <b-ot> dschuett, you have one new message, just say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[06:38:41] <faraway> Lupa: if you have an asyc ajax call the code after the $.getJSON is executed immediately, then after the data is retrieved form the server the callback you pass to the getJSON is executed
[06:38:59] <dschuett> read
[06:39:20] <dschuett> b-ot:read
[06:39:20] <b-ot> dschuett, from coldhead, 9h 33m ago: YOU ARE SO WELCOME
[06:43:34] <sahbeewah> i think you can work around it using outerHTML
[06:45:58] <eltreno> sahbeewah - ok i'll have a look into that thanks

[06:49:25] <faraway> i plane to use the detach function for elements that i want to remove from the page temporary and add them later, to make sure the data and events will be still registrated with the elements, will this elements cause memory leaks in IE., or are the events cleared in IE on page unload ?
[06:54:23] <faraway> and can i call the remove() on a detected element to release its event handlers and data and all of the on the at assigned to the descendants. or do i need to add the element to the dom and call then remove ?
[07:00:07] <hool> an HTMLAnchorElement should have a trigger() method defined on it, no?
[07:00:13] <e-anima> is there a shorter wa to do this: var values_found = {}; values_found['homepage'] = {};  values_found['homepage']['field_url'] = values[key];
[07:03:05] <pachet> faraway: you can .detach and then .remove, you don't have to put it back first
[07:03:50] <pachet> as for IE leaking, you're much more likely to get leaks over the lifespan of the page from your own uncleared references than from jquery
[07:06:12] <faraway> pachet: i'm perfect i clear every thing ;P -.-  so jquery should take care about detached elements, like it does for the one that are still in the dom. (for the events  and the data set by jquery)
[07:09:59] <pachet> faraway: yes

[07:31:07] <greek> Heya fellas. With $("select").change(...) is there a way for me to revert the select menu to the previously selected option?
[07:31:59] <greek> ie: $(this).val() returns the newly selected option, but I'm wondering if I can get the value of the previously selected option via jquery (instead of having to store a variable that I continuously update)
[07:32:15] <stack> hello, is that possible that sometimes the $(element).load(function(){}); is not executed if the element (an image in this case) is already present in the browser cache?
[07:34:47] <faraway> stack: yes
[07:35:05] <stack> faraway: how can I resolve that issue?
[07:35:11] <faraway> stack: the load function is called at the moment the e.g. image is loaded
[07:35:38] <faraway> stack: do you want to get events for an image ?
[07:35:51] <Brodingo> greek store it initially?
[07:35:57] <stack> faraway: yes, when it loads I want it to fadeIn()
[07:36:08] <stack> (or maybe if it is already loaded just display it)
[07:37:02] <Brodingo> ?g images loaded desandro
[07:37:03] <bot-t> Brodingo, desandro/imagesloaded ∑ GitHub - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/
[07:37:25] <faraway> stack: what  you could do is the following img = new Image(); img.onload = function() {}; img.src = $(element).attr("src")
[07:37:31] <e-anima> is there a shorter wa to do this: var values_found = {}; values_found['homepage'] = {};  values_found['homepage']['field_url'] = values[key];
[07:38:37] <faraway> stack: the important thing is to set the src after you set the callback for the image, otherwise you could again have problems with the cache
[07:38:59] <stack> faraway: mh ok I'll check that method.

[07:40:25] <greek> Brodingo, yup that's what I'm currently doing, I was just wondering if jQuery has a method like .val() that returns the previously selected value ;0

[07:50:16] <majd> Hey #jquery, i've pretty much spent all day trying to resolve this: I'm using a jQuery based ajax uploader. The upload is setup like so: https://github.com/GoodCloud/django-ajax-uploader#step-4-set-up-your-template
[07:52:43] <majd> When the returned json's html attribute is any text, it works just fine, but when i include any html that has ' or " in it (e.g. <div id="someid">), the responseJSON returned is an Object() with non of the attributes i expect on it http://dpaste.org/WbibT/
[07:52:50] <majd> any thoughts on what's going on?
[07:54:23] <eltreno> sahbeewah: http://jsfiddle.net/eltreno/LWa5s/4/  you can see this example keeps white-space in all browser except IE8 and below
[08:01:06] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:01:15] <windk> hi
[08:01:16] <Seer49> hey guys
[08:03:02] <dschuett> does anyone know how to pass additional form fields along with a file upload using jquery form plugin?
[08:03:17] <dschuett> I can't seem to get additional fields to pass
[08:03:31] <sahbeewah> eltreno: i don't have ie on me
[08:04:16] <sahbeewah> eltreno: http://jsfiddle.net/LWa5s/5/ ? is this the same?
[08:04:59] <faraway> majd: what language do you use server side ?
[08:06:00] <eltreno> sahbeewah: ok no probs - but in any case you can see what the example is - if I save the string to a JS var - then is saves the whitespace and formats it correctly in IE - so it seems IE removes whitespace up front before I can get to it with JS :(
[08:06:10] <eltreno> sahbeewah: yes your example still works in IE 9 only
[08:06:33] <eltreno> sahbeewah: it loses whitespace in IE8 and lower
[08:07:28] <GreekFreak> I am trying to set the checked value of a checkbox, and it doesn't seem to work for some reason. This is what I'm doing department_radio_add_new.prop("checked", true)   FYI, this is a buttonset, using the jQuery radio buttonset :P{
[08:09:25] <windk> http://jqfundamentals.com/book/ this book is very good for beginners
[08:09:44] <faraway> majd: and how do you parse the string you get ?
[08:10:31] <eltreno> sahbeewah: I also tried $('#output')[0].outerHTML = $str;  but whitespce is removed - even alert($str) on second line has whitespace removed in IE8 and below :) I don't think it can be done :(
[08:10:59] <majd_> faraway: i'm not doing any parsing - the jQuery plugin is: https://github.com/GoodCloud/django-ajax-uploader/blob/master/ajaxuploader/static/ajaxuploader/js/fileuploader.js
[08:11:15] <faraway> majd_: just saw it .. sorry .. my fault
[08:11:30] <snix> hi guys, if i want to add a nested ul list with ajax, is it better to generate the html structure server side and then just send a string and string.appendTo(blah) or would i better send a json object or something and use the DOM to add stuff and create tags?
[08:11:42] <snix> what is the recommended way to change things in the html?
[08:11:43] <majd_> faraway: np - any thoughts?
[08:12:07] <faraway> majd_: do you get an empty result ?
[08:12:45] <beachdog> snix: usual pattern is to send json from server, client renders html from it and appends to dom
[08:13:22] <snix> beachdog: ah how does this work? i mean what do you mean by client renders html from json?
[08:13:26] <snix> how does the client do that?
[08:13:27] <beachdog> or use some framework e.g. backbone that updates a client side model from which view is updated
[08:13:38] <majd_> faraway: the result is identical to if i type in the console result = Object()
[08:15:51] <snix> hey i am using $(".blah").bind("onclick", function() { how would i access the actual element that was clicked inside this function here? return thx; });
[08:16:22] <faraway> majd_: i took a short look at the source of the fileuplaoder, it is imho a bug of the plugin.  the problem is that it uses the response as a string, so the \"  becomes a "  and then parsing does not work
[08:17:16] <faraway> majd_: you could solve it with using \\\"
[08:17:24] <EricBGSU> snix : $(this) ?
[08:17:27] <majd_> faraway: i thought so, what line are you referring to?
[08:17:40] <snix> hmm let me try that EricBGSU
[08:17:56] <snix> im not sure that works
[08:17:58] <faraway> majd_: 1288 : the eval
[08:18:08] <snix> actually why would it
[08:18:37] <faraway> majd_: it concatenates the "(" + result + ")"  so the escaping then gets lost
[08:20:30] <majd_> faraway: right!! any thoughts on how should i modify the code to work around this?
[08:23:49] <Nancy2012> Hello ‚Ä¶ I am using jquery tool tab plugin‚Ä¶ and i also using google map plugin but.. the problem is the whenever i add or define any div and its class inside the jquery tool tab code‚Ä¶ it shows me disabled source code on firebug
[08:24:44] <hlveheart> ?jsfiddle Nancy2012
[08:24:46] <bot-t> hlveheart, Couldn't find "jsfiddle Nancy2012" in jQuery Docs.
[08:24:48] <hlveheart> >:/
[08:25:08] <hlveheart> Nancy2012, http://jsfiddle.net/ it's easier for us to debug what we're able to see
[08:25:09] <hlveheart> ;)
[08:25:29] <faraway> majd_: i use query so that i don't need to thin about it :P so probably brows the query source to find the solution how to fix FileUploader :D
[08:25:50] <snix> can i ask jquery mobile questions here as well?
[08:26:01] <hlveheart> Of course you can snix
[08:26:14] <faraway> majd_: sorry, i currently have no idea ‚Ä¶ and currently no time to think of it
[08:26:50] <majd_> faraway: haha - you're right. Thanks so much for the help. At least now i know how to work around it.
[08:28:27] <lilalinuxHamburg> I would like to add some custom data to the callback "success" of $.ajax()
[08:28:30] <lilalinuxHamburg> how do I do that?
[08:28:39] <snix> cool
[08:28:50] <snix> i have a question $("div:jqmData(role='collapsible')").bind('expand', function () { how would i access the element that was expanded here inside the function?? return thx; });
[08:29:34] <hlveheart> yeah, that's readable.
[08:29:38] <hlveheart> .. o.o
[08:30:10] <snix> whats the best content type btw to just send stuff to the ajax server in utf-8? i mean application/json or text/html or what?
[08:30:23] <snix> if you just want to send single values, but in utf-8 not in urlencode which is default
[08:31:34] <therealkoopa> Does anyone have ideas on how to display an image download progress bar?
[08:32:09] <hlveheart> I bet Google knows...
[08:32:16] <hlveheart> He's the all knowing man-genius, and all.
[08:32:35] <therealkoopa> hlveheart: He's struggling today.
[08:32:36] <snix> actually event.target might do it
[08:32:39] <lilalinuxHamburg> therealkoopa: add a class when starting to download, remove class when finished
[08:32:46] <snix> google is an idiot sorry
[08:32:51] <snix> very dull
[08:33:02] <hlveheart> you're dull, and don't know how to use him!
[08:33:12] <snix> no its not my fault
[08:33:17] <hlveheart> It kinda is. :P
[08:33:18] <snix> its his fault
[08:33:32] <hlveheart> Maybe he just likes me or something.
[08:33:33] <EricBGSU> if you put the right words into google, I assure you, you can find not dull stuff...
[08:33:38] <EricBGSU> (then you bookmark it)
[08:33:42] <hlveheart> lol
[08:34:15] <faraway> lilalinuxHamburg: you could use the bind for the callback (not supported by all browsers) or the context parameter that you then could access with this
[08:34:25] <therealkoopa> lilalinuxHamburg: I'd like to figure out if the browser can tell me how much data it's downloaded.  I don't think it's possible.  I could I could fetch it using xhr, but if hte image comes from a CDN, then it's a cross domain issue.
[08:35:46] <hlveheart> therealkoopa, i don't think that's possible... i think most browsers protect against that kinda stuff becasue it could be exploited
[08:35:46] <hlveheart> :S
[08:35:49] <lilalinuxHamburg> faraway: thx
[08:37:14] <therealkoopa> Ok, different idea.  If a div has css set for backgroundImage.  Is there a way to know when it's been loaded?
[08:37:21] <therealkoopa> Or do you need to use an image element
[08:38:25] <faraway> therealkoopa: the reliable way is retrieve the src of the image and use Image() for testing
[08:38:47] <therealkoopa> faraway: That's what I figured since we don't have css callbacks :)
[08:40:57] <faraway> therealkoopa: one side notice imho in IE background images are still not cached by default and then requested another time
[08:41:31] <therealkoopa> faraway: Do you know if that's also true in IE9
[08:42:11] <faraway> therealkoopa: don't know i always include "document.execCommand("BackgroundImageCache", false, true);"  in a try cache block :D
[08:42:45] <faraway> therealkoopa: but probably i was just IE 6 ...  never tried to figure out
[08:42:59] <therealkoopa> faraway: Ah, well I can throw that command in if need be.  Thanks!
[08:43:50] <faraway> therealkoopa: but at least it could still happen that you will have at least a request with a not-modified-since header to your server, so make sure that this is handled correctly
[08:44:24] <therealkoopa> faraway: Right.

[08:57:57] <Nancy2012> map is not loading inside the code.. just because i want to use the map code inside the query tool tab plugin
[08:58:09] <Nancy2012> there is a kind of conflict arised
[08:58:37] <imachuchu> I'm having a problem with autocomplete and cloning fields, I was told yesterday to try and instead attach autocomplete to a parent object then clone the children text boxes, any ideas/tutorials on how?
[08:58:50] <Nancy2012> please see this‚Ä¶.http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/23/
[08:59:27] <Nancy2012> tabbing system works but map div is not loading
[08:59:30] <Nancy2012> please help me
[09:05:08] <ffrrnk> hi there. can someone please help me? how do i get the (sumbit) handler that is bound to a button?
[09:05:15] <zulu-gula> I've added latest jquery-ui and jquery library to my page and this animation does not work: $('div').animate({backgroundColor: "#549cd5"},1000,function(){$(this).css('background','red');});
[09:05:37] <ffrrnk> In my case, I want to save that, put my own until something is finished, and the recover the old handler...
[09:06:34] <ffrrnk> or is it generally commo to just overlay the button with a div to prevent fireing ? I find that ugly
[09:07:00] <xcv> change the btn's onclick event handler?
[09:07:20] <xcv> "to prevent firing"
[09:07:50] <ffrrnk> yeah changing works:  $('#mybutton').submit( blabla) ... but how do I revover the old handler then?
[09:07:56] <faraway> Nancy2012: move the google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', load);  behind the definition of the load function
[09:08:19] <xcv> put it into a global variable
[09:08:34] <xcv> which is ugly, actually
[09:08:39] <Nancy2012> faraway: it seems work now‚Ä¶ you may sees
[09:08:41] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/31/
[09:08:49] <xcv> otherwise put it into a property of a dom object?
[09:09:48] <der_On> hi
[09:11:03] <faraway> Nancy2012: beside that fact that does not run  in jsfiddle for me cause you added html content to javascript, i still think you need the part behind the definition of the load function :D
[09:11:11] <der_On> I have a wrapping element and a nested element inside that wrapper and need to move the nested element after the wrapping element and then remove the wrapper. this however causes an error in jquery
[09:11:40] <faraway> der_On: why not just unwrap ?
[09:11:47] <der_On> how?
[09:12:09] <Nancy2012> faraway: i am using load function ‚Ä¶.
[09:12:11] <Nancy2012> google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', load);
[09:12:19] <Nancy2012> not on the body tah
[09:12:20] <der_On> oh boy. there is a method unwrap
[09:12:21] <Nancy2012> tag*
[09:13:55] <faraway> i know but at the place where you use the google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', load);  the function load() { } is not defined, so it should not work .. at least not in all browsers
[09:14:04] <faraway> der_On: that on i ment ;)
[09:14:16] <der_On> thx
[09:19:14] <kreantos> hello
[09:19:33] <hlveheart> we don't want any.
[09:19:47] <kreantos> is there a way to catch if a height of an element is changed
[09:20:05] <imachuchu> any ideas on my problem, needing to attach jquery autocomplete to a parent div so that if any children text boxes are cloned/renamed the autocomplete still works?
[09:20:09] <kreantos> binding to the resize event does not work
[09:20:43] <hlveheart> kreantos: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[09:21:02] <hlveheart> ^^
[09:21:43] <kreantos> hlveheart, yep found this one to
[09:21:57] <kreantos> but it seems discontinued
[09:22:09] <kreantos> last commit 2 years ago
[09:23:07] <faraway> kreantos: do you change the height yourself ?
[09:23:29] <kreantos> its changed by rendering templates
[09:23:57] <kreantos> problem here is that i would have to change the sourcecode of the libraries i use
[09:24:02] <kreantos> wich i dont want to
[09:24:51] <kreantos> basically i have a dive element, and when it changes i want to call a function
[09:25:06] <faraway> kreantos: the problem with the libraries that emulate the resize event, like the one above is that they - imho - use setTimeout to check height in regular intervals
[09:25:22] <kreantos> ogm
[09:25:24] <kreantos> omg
[09:25:46] <kreantos> i tried this one $('#myDiv').bind('DOMNodeInserted DOMNodeRemoved'
[09:26:06] <kreantos> but i get like a ton of events
[09:26:10] <kreantos> :)
[09:26:29] <faraway> kreantos: this is not well supported in the browsers, and even buggy in some of them
[09:26:53] <kreantos> oh, thank you for the hint ;(
[09:27:08] <kreantos> this cant be that complex
[09:30:26] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. is there a jqueryUI "theme" or css out there for the tabs plugin that is just the bare minimum CSS to make the tabs work? They clearly do not work without calling the jqueryUI tabs css file but its not pretty (in my opinion) and I want to actually put the tabs in an entirely different position
[09:30:35] <faraway> kreantos: if you say though :P  i ended with a notification center where submit a notification that e.g. dom change and where i could registrate callbacks for that event. -.-
[09:30:47] <LindsayMac> I just want the bare minimum CSS that makes the display / hidden aspects work.
[09:31:32] <faraway> kreantos: -though +so ^^
[09:31:45] <kreantos> faraway, i'm triggering now events everytime when the ajax call gets results, ugly but working -.-
[09:32:55] <faraway> kreantos: yes thats what i'm also doing .. but not with the dom event but with a notification (publication subscription) center which is a little but more elegant in my case.
[09:33:57] <kreantos> i see
[09:37:21] <faraway> kreantos: damn .. today is not my writing day ‚Ä¶ it's time for end of work ^^
[09:37:41] <kreantos> haha true :)
[09:39:37] <Nancy2012> faraway: this map div is still disable whenever i paste middle of tool tab plugin code
[09:39:42] <Nancy2012> what should i do?
[09:39:45] <LindsayMac> anyone have a skeleton css class for jqueryUI tabs that I can use?
[09:42:25] <adamholwerda> why not just modify the .ui-tabs, .ui-tabs-nav ? what sort of look are you trying to get
[09:43:24] <LindsayMac> adamholwerda:  there is a LOT of styling in the default UI tabs css that I just don't like and don't need
[09:44:02] <LindsayMac> adamholwerda:  I really just need the bare minimum CSS styles that make it work. The classes that trigger the hide/display. Instead of rooting through all the files and looking for just those, I asumed someone out there might have something similar
[09:49:47] <LindsayMac> So i guess I will make my own?
[09:54:58] <mister_m> I have a span on my page with the class as follows: <span class="matrixspan">TEST MATRIX SPAN</span>, but for some reason $(".matrixspan") is not able to find it.
[09:55:42] <AngryMan2> fancy box vs facebox?
[09:56:43] <LindsayMac> What about... AngryMan2 FACYBOX?
[09:57:36] <mister_m> how would my jquery selector fail? it is failing from the chromium developer console
[09:57:50] <mister_m> and I see the span if I inspect the source
[09:58:30] <mister_m> oh wait - in the actual PAGE source it is just &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;matrixspan&quot;&gt;TEST MATRIX SPAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
[09:58:44] <mister_m> nevermind
[10:01:56] <LindsayMac> SO i am thinking I am ditching jqueryUI tabs. its too much for what I need. I just need a very minimal tab content. Anyone have a suggestion for an easy lightweight tab builder
[10:02:17] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: bootstrap?
[10:02:38] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  i am a HUGE fan of bootstrap... and I was thinking i might just use their tabs..
[10:02:39] <hlveheart> i love me some bootstrap
[10:02:52] <LindsayMac> but I went with jqueryUI because I am already using it for other things..
[10:03:06] <LindsayMac> hlveheart:  i am a HUGE bootstrap fan too.. built a whole admin dashboard using bootstrap
[10:04:15] <LindsayMac> are the bootstrap tabs that simplified though? I figured them being a part of a framework may have added more bloat to a site that already has a LOT of JS going on
[10:04:30] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: what do you mean simplified?
[10:04:47] <johnkpaul> the amount of boilerplate is pretty much the same
[10:04:58] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  i dont have a need to a lot of the added features like ajax loading and all of that .
[10:05:08] <LindsayMac> just a simple show/hide tab builder..
[10:05:17] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: then why not just not-use those features?
[10:05:24] <johnkpaul> what is making you want to leave jquery ui completely
[10:05:28] <Nancy2012> I have been trying to fix my problem since last couple of hours...
[10:05:34] <Nancy2012> but still having the same
[10:05:41] <Nancy2012> i need your guys help
[10:05:45] <Nancy2012> please have a look http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/45/
[10:06:03] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  I can only use those features, but it just adds bloat to the files I am calling from the core.
[10:06:06] <Nancy2012> only problem is that Google map is not loading
[10:06:16] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: bloat meaning file size?
[10:06:20] <LindsayMac> yea
[10:06:49] <Nancy2012> please help me‚Ä¶
[10:06:55] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  this site already has a LOT of stuff that needs to load for it to work, so i'm trying not to kill it with additional code
[10:07:02] <bakers> Is the latest JQuery test suite available online? This seems pretty minimal http://ejohn.org/apps/sizzle/test/
[10:07:04] <kreantos> hmm
[10:07:22] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: you're using the jquery ui builder, right?
[10:07:28] <hlveheart> lol Nancy2012.
[10:07:29] <hlveheart> one sec.
[10:07:37] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  you mean the jqueryUI theme builder? no.
[10:07:37] <Nancy2012> ok...
[10:07:42] <johnkpaul> the difference between jquery ui tabs by itself and bootstrap tabs by itself, is marginal
[10:07:45] <johnkpaul> no, not the theme builder
[10:07:52] <kreantos> i have a page, and if i check its height i get the pixelheight, but if i have this site included in an iframe i only get 0
[10:07:58] <Nancy2012> may you please let me know what is the problem inside the code?
[10:08:04] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: http://jqueryui.com/download/
[10:08:04] <kreantos> is there a solution for this problem?
[10:08:14] <Nancy2012> why doesn't google map load on there
[10:08:40] <Brodingo> Nancy2012 check the console
[10:08:41] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul: yes.. I have used that.. but my point is that when choose tabs.. you are downloading a lot of code I dont need
[10:08:57] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: I don't know if that's true
[10:09:08] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  i dont need the added features of ajax loading, etc. It adds to the size of the jqueryUI-tabs file..
[10:09:19] <johnkpaul> sure, but I don't know if it's "a lot"
[10:09:22] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  yes.. you can not choose to only download jqueryUI tabs without added features.
[10:09:22] <johnkpaul> I suppose that is subjective
[10:09:40] <LindsayMac> well... you're right. Its not A LOT but like i said.. this site already has a LOT to load infrot of all of that stuff
[10:09:47] <johnkpaul> I think it'd be better bang for your time to just optimize your jquery ui download as a while
[10:09:49] <johnkpaul> whole*
[10:09:55] <johnkpaul> and not worry about the potential salvation of 2 k
[10:09:57] <LindsayMac> so little bits add to to bigger bits and I am trying to not bloat the heck out of this site
[10:10:15] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: without actual benchmarks and tests, that "gut feel" stuff is really hard to work with
[10:10:17] <Brodingo> Nancy2012 also, youre putting the script tags in the script section, put them in the html
[10:10:26] <LindsayMac> optimize jqueryUI download versus just using a tabs pluign that does ONLY what i want out of the box?
[10:10:38] <Nancy2012> ok
[10:10:44] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/VXZYA/47/
[10:10:45] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: yes, your code already works no?
[10:10:48] <hlveheart> I fixed your script tags
[10:10:49] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul: do you know of a place where i can run tests and share the results with you?
[10:10:53] <Brodingo> Nancy2012 or theres an add resources option on the side
[10:11:05] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  yea the code works.. but sometimes just working isn't ideal. I am looking for the best way.
[10:11:24] <johnkpaul> :) I agree with you wholeheartedly, but I think that the cost benefit is what you need to look into
[10:11:27] <LindsayMac> I had bloat and code that is not and never will be used. Call me a purist.. i dont think its necessary and definitely not needed
[10:11:36] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: http://www.webpagetest.org/
[10:11:48] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  the cost?? The cost of implementing a simple tabs plugin versus a jqueryUI one?
[10:12:00] <LindsayMac> Sure.. the cost of going through and rebuilding the jqueryUI tabs is more than its worth,
[10:12:13] <LindsayMac> but the cost of getting a referral to a better,, smaller, cleaner plugin isn't high at all.
[10:12:23] <Nancy2012> i have added but the problem is the same
[10:12:24] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/49/
[10:12:47] <Nancy2012> Google map is not loading on the output frame
[10:13:28] <LindsayMac> Oh shoot.. i'm not going to be able to test until the site is launched. Its developed behind a IP block on the main domain.. dont ask. Client demanded that
[10:13:39] <Nancy2012> i was trying with another way‚Ä¶ in which it works but i had to put the <div id="map"> out of query tool tab dive
[10:13:51] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/31/
[10:14:35] <Nancy2012> please help me guys
[10:14:40] <Nancy2012> :(
[10:15:00] <hlveheart> Nancy, I'm still looking at it
[10:15:03] <hlveheart> be patient dude, please
[10:15:04] <hlveheart> lol
[10:15:06] <Nancy2012> thanks :)
[10:15:08] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  you have a bunch of errors on the page..
[10:15:14] <LindsayMac> begging isn't a good look
[10:15:29] <Brodingo> Nancy2012 and you still didnt take the script tags out
[10:15:40] <hlveheart> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/VXZYA/52/
[10:15:44] <hlveheart> I already fixed that for her
[10:15:47] <hlveheart> but I can't get the map to work
[10:16:10] <LindsayMac> hlveheart:  theres errors all over the place.. thats why
[10:16:21] <Nancy2012> do u know‚Ä¶ i just want to add this google map on the jquery tool tab‚Ä¶ i think there is conflict because it shows the div ="map" disable in the firebug
[10:16:41] <Brodingo> relative paths?
[10:16:54] <hlveheart> firefox error console isn't picking up any errors until you select "lattitude" or "longitude"
[10:16:56] <hlveheart> o;
[10:17:00] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  where did you copy this code from?
[10:17:08] <LindsayMac> hlveheart:  not for me.. i'm getting errors without selecting anything
[10:17:16] <LindsayMac> hlveheart:  Nancy2012 ReferenceError: showAddress is not defined

[10:17:27] <LindsayMac> 	
[10:17:29] <LindsayMac> oops sorry
[10:17:33] <hlveheart> ah :3
[10:17:33] <Nancy2012> i am using this‚Ä¶
[10:17:34] <Nancy2012> http://www.jquerytools.org/demos/scrollable/wizard.htm
[10:17:43] <Nancy2012> and the google map
[10:17:57] <Brodingo> lots of gross things happening
[10:17:58] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  i was asking about the map
[10:18:05] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  yea.. thats what I was trying to say
[10:18:26] <Brodingo> heh
[10:18:43] <LindsayMac> thats a nice little script though
[10:18:56] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  where did you get your map script from?
[10:20:00] <Nancy2012> from one website...
[10:20:18] <Nancy2012> wait.. i am setting up for your guys to having a look
[10:20:37] <Nancy2012> but it is hard
[10:20:55] <Nancy2012> you can't access because it is from admin panel
[10:21:26] <Nancy2012> i have been tying to fix it up since a long time...
[10:21:31] <Nancy2012> only found one thing ...
[10:21:37] <Nancy2012> there is a little conflict
[10:22:07] <Nancy2012> because of jquey tool tab div wouldn't let access to this map div
[10:22:42] <Nancy2012> but here it is works...
[10:22:43] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/51/
[10:23:04] <Nancy2012> if i put this map div.. out of tab div ...
[10:23:07] <Nancy2012> it woks
[10:23:12] <Nancy2012> but inside it wouldn't work
[10:23:23] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  is it in a tab that is hidden?
[10:23:29] <ffrrnk> @xcv ok, sorry.. i was distracted... we were talking about the submit handler, i want to suspend .... you set I can save it in some globar var for some time... ok
[10:23:41] <ffrrnk> my question is: how do i get the submit handler????
[10:23:44] <LindsayMac> I am strangely getting errors just from the code copied and pasted from the demo tab site
[10:23:53] <ffrrnk> submit() is not for getting it, it just submits ?!
[10:23:59] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/KZfEk/
[10:24:23] <ffrrnk> how can I GET the submi handler of some object?
[10:25:44] <Escherial> hello. i'm having some trouble with slideDown() being kind of stuttery in firefox; is there much i can do to help that?
[10:25:52] <Escherial> the page in question: http://hrungnir.dyndns.org:8088/
[10:26:25] <Escherial> i'm trying to display a slider, and i was hoping that hiding the contents first, doing slideDown() on the frame, then fading in the contents would help speed things up
[10:26:26] <ffrrnk> faster client pc?
[10:26:39] <Escherial> ffrrnk: it's perfectly smooth in chrome
[10:26:52] <Escherial> basically looking for small optimizations that i can make to make it smoother across all browsers
[10:26:57] <Nancy2012> can you see...
[10:26:58] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/KZfEk/2/
[10:27:21] <Nancy2012> only problem with loading google map inside the wizard div
[10:28:55] <ffrrnk> i cant click anything there, just enter email
[10:28:55] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  do you have a google maps key?
[10:29:05] <Nancy2012> not really‚Ä¶
[10:29:12] <LindsayMac> not really?? Is that even an answer?!
[10:29:17] <Brodingo> lol
[10:29:21] <Nancy2012> we don't need the key for accessing map
[10:30:18] <Escherial> Nancy2012: i can see it; what's the problem?
[10:30:27] <snix> hello can you please give an example how you can create a collapsible IN CODE?
[10:30:29] <Nancy2012> really?
[10:30:31] <Escherial> ah, never mind; poor reading comprehension
[10:30:47] <snix> i dont mean writing the html out manually and then calling .collapsible() on it
[10:30:49] <snix> do you have any idea?
[10:30:52] <Escherial> Nancy2012: and yeah, LindsayMac is right; you need an api key to embed google maps on your page
[10:31:19] <Escherial> Nancy2012: https://developers.google.com/maps/signup should get you started
[10:31:37] <snix> i mean something like newCollapsible = document.createElement('collapsible')
[10:31:42] <Escherial> er, or rather https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
[10:31:51] <snix> i tried everything it does not seem to work
[10:32:41] <Nancy2012> Escherial: We don't need the key especially, when we are using google map library version 3
[10:33:03] <cohitre> snix: $('<div />').collapsible()
[10:33:06] <Escherial> oh, you're right...huh, it used to work that way
[10:33:25] <cohitre> you'll have to append your newly created div to the document
[10:33:48] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  play with this.. its cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/KZfEk/5/
[10:34:33] <Nancy2012> i have been playing since last 6 hours
[10:34:40] <ffrrnk> I thought "not really...  we don't need the key for accessing map" means Nancy has her IP address registered at google to get stuff for free
[10:34:40] <Nancy2012> i don't have any engery to play more
[10:35:10] <Nancy2012> man‚Ä¶ look it up‚Ä¶ here it works ‚Ä¶. http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/51/
[10:35:13] <snix> cohitre: no, that is writign it manually. note that you need content
[10:35:25] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  then we arent going todo your work for you.. if you give up. I give up
[10:35:29] <snix> cohitre: i mean, how would you add content to that without writing it manually?
[10:35:31] <Nancy2012> so i am using the same google map code..
[10:35:40] <cohitre> i don't know what collapsible plugin you're using, but most likely you'll have to add the content programatically
[10:35:49] <Nancy2012>  i cant give up
[10:36:00] <cohitre> i mean‚Ä¶ what's the point of having a collapsible with no content...
[10:36:00] <Nancy2012> but at least i want to know what wrong with my code...
[10:36:04] <Nancy2012> why doesn't it work
[10:36:10] <Nancy2012> that is a problem...
[10:36:29] <Escherial> Nancy2012: a good place to start is seeing if your load() function is being called; throw an alert or a console.log() in there
[10:36:32] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  if you give up working with it.. i give up
[10:37:05] <Nancy2012> look here‚Ä¶ http://jsfiddle.net/VXZYA/55/
[10:37:20] <Nancy2012> here it works.. inside the tab div
[10:37:35] <Nancy2012> but the problem is that google map doesn't look pretty ok
[10:37:39] <LindsayMac> WHAT?!
[10:37:43] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  what works there?
[10:37:51] <Escherial> yeah, i'm confused too; it looks like a mess
[10:37:59] <Nancy2012> click on the address details link
[10:38:15] <Nancy2012> and see ‚Ä¶it works
[10:38:18] <LindsayMac> Nancy2012:  they told you 3 times now to NOT use the <script> inside that javascript block
[10:38:20] <Nancy2012> but not properly
[10:38:27] <Brodingo> abandon ship
[10:38:38] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i think you're right
[10:38:55] <Nancy2012> sorry..i used the old code that is way  it shows with script tags
[10:39:57] <Escherial> well, you need the script tags in some form, but they should be in your html, not in your js
[10:40:20] <Escherial> ugh, sorry, i'm not being of much help...probably should try to address things after coffee...
[10:40:25] <ThaDick> Is there a BP preference for using .on(), as opposed to say using .hover(), or .click()?
[10:41:00] <Brodingo> .on() is tite cause it delegates
[10:41:01] <wghwrhh> testing
[10:41:24] <Brodingo> hover and click bind
[10:42:03] <ThaDick> Gotcha ‚Ä¶ Thanks Brodingo
[10:42:40] <LindsayMac> I am playing with a smooth scrolling script that I made with the help of a tutorial (i am still learning JS) and I am trying to add the ability to link to a div using a hash in the url from outside of the page. I am using window.location.hash but i think i might be using it incorrectly
[10:42:48] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/bbf11805c9b65cef1666 here is my code
[10:42:55] <foobarram001> Hi all.. I am quite new to jquery.. and I have started a small blog project.. and I am trying to include a jquery element for "review stars".. The problem is, I am using it in conjunction with twitter bootstrap..which has its own set of jquery elements..So, I have something like: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/808/  so, I have the bootstrap element "carousel" and the jquery element.. and when they are combined it dose
[10:42:55] <foobarram001> nt seem to work.. when I remove the carousel element.. it works..was wondering how I could make this work with carousel element included.. Is this a naming conflict here?
[10:43:43] <wghwrhh> test
[10:44:11] <Brodingo> wghwrhh what are you testing
[10:44:39] <wghwrhh> I'm using webchat and am making a script to remove the join leave messages
[10:44:44] <wghwrhh> and its working now
[10:44:57] <LindsayMac> congrats?
[10:44:58] <Brodingo> coolbeans
[10:44:59] <wghwrhh> http://jsfiddle.net/7vmQf/2/
[10:45:41] <LindsayMac> So can anyone give me a hand with my window.location.hash issue?
[10:45:53] <cohitre> LindsayMac: you can listen to the hash change event instead of binding to the individual links
[10:45:53] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/bbf11805c9b65cef1666
[10:46:01] <Escherial> LindsayMac: ignore this if you're doing what you described as a learning exercise, but there's a plugin for what you're doing: flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jquerylocalscroll-10.html
[10:46:07] <LindsayMac> cohitre:  i am very VERY new...
[10:46:09] <cohitre> LindsayMac: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[10:46:19] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  i am familiar with that plugin.. i've used it.. but i felt I needed to learn better
[10:46:41] <LindsayMac> cohitre:  can you expand a little for a newbie?
[10:46:52] <LindsayMac> oh wait.. got yout link
[10:47:26] <LindsayMac> I would just like to learn why my code isn't working.. because in my  head, logically (lindsay logic) says it shou;d
[10:49:04] <voot545> I really don't like that ben alman plugin
[10:49:13] <LindsayMac> voot545:  any reason?
[10:50:59] <voot545> ah, wrong one; I didn't see he had so many
[10:51:16] <voot545> he has another one that does postMessage emulation, but it's crap
[10:51:21] <voot545> the one you're using might be good so nvm
[10:51:41] <LindsayMac> I am more interested in learning why my code didnt work so I can actually learn from it versus just copy / paste pirate
[10:51:53] <Escherial> LindsayMac: i've reposted your code as a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sPTE3/
[10:52:10] <egwwegwg> guy i turned off console.log, did any1 leave since i came in?
[10:52:12] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  thanks.. wasn't sure it was necessary for this or not
[10:52:15] <Escherial> i added some lorem ipsum and two links to test moving back and forth between them smoothly, but yeah, as you mentioned, it's just doing the default behavior
[10:52:18] <egwwegwg> or join
[10:52:26] <Escherial> LindsayMac: i thought it might help people to at least see what the problem is :3
[10:52:36] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  sure.. i appreciate it
[10:52:51] <imachuchu> if someone has knowledge about jquery autocomplete are delegating jquery ui elements, I am trying to be able to clone a field with autocomplete on it and have the new field also work with autocomplete, http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/5/
[10:52:57] <Escherial> no errors either, so that rules out the obvious :| maybe it's having a problem matching the links
[10:53:08] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  so that is just my code unchanged with added html right?
[10:53:24] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  from what you can see... is there no issue with my code generally speaking?
[10:53:35] <LindsayMac> and no.. no errors.. my site as a whole is errorless ;)
[10:53:47] <imachuchu> the fiddle doesn't work (the data source isn't set up), but the method used doesn't work either, what am I doing wrong? (further discussion of this kind of problem http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/configuring-ui-widgets-and-interactions-with-live/ )
[10:54:19] <Escherial> LindsayMac: looks like it's failing when it tests for the target; it always returns false
[10:55:30] <Escherial> weird, that can't be it...sorry, still debugging
[10:55:37] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  yea.. i'm not sure how to go around it...
[10:55:43] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  its ok.. i appreciate you looking
[10:55:57] <egwwegwg> it's working any1 want the js for the bookmarklet?
[10:56:04] <egwwegwg> window.ircWindow=window.ircWindow||document.getElementsByClassName("ircwindow")[0];window.dom=window.dom||function(a){for(var a=a.target.lastChild,c=a.getElementsByTagName("span"),b=0;b<c.length;b++)"=="===c[b].innerHTML&&a.parentNode.removeChild(a)};window.isAlreadyBlocked?ircWindow.removeEventListener("DOMSubtreeModified",dom,!1):(ircWindow.addEventListener("DOMSubtreeModified",dom,!1),window.isAlreadyBlocked=!0);
[10:56:28] <hlveheart> what is it?
[10:56:29] <egwwegwg> or http://jsfiddle.net/JMTMj/
[10:56:55] <egwwegwg> it toggles the display of the join/leave messages in webvhat
[10:57:01] <egwwegwg> *webchat
[10:57:23] <Escherial> LindsayMac: aha, it's because $(this.hash) is looking for a link with that id, not name
[10:57:49] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  but I am using id's .. why would it need a name?
[10:58:09] <Escherial> erm, that was my error, never mind; i usually link a's by their name, not their id...
[10:58:46] <LindsayMac> Ok phew.. i thought i was loosing my MIND!
[10:58:54] <Escherial> LindsayMac: what's the problem you were having originally? it seems to work for me now
[10:58:57] <tw2113> i lost mine once
[10:59:07] <tw2113> never again...it takes finding it to repeat
[10:59:20] <Escherial> LindsayMac: and by work, i mean it scrolls to the bottom, top, as i expected it to... http://jsfiddle.net/sPTE3/1/
[10:59:21] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  the smooth scrolling works just fine.. i just want to be able to link to a div container from outside of the site..
[10:59:29] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  yea.. that has always worked
[10:59:50] <Escherial> ah
[10:59:57] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  does that make sense?
[11:00:08] <b1lly> if i have javascript in an ajax response and append it to the markup, will it render?
[11:00:25] <LindsayMac> I was told to look up window.location.hash and from what i see, using that will help the browser look for the id and go to it when the window is opened with the hash..
[11:07:37] <k1ng_> does anyone has error handler for ajax error?
[11:07:40] <k1ng_> all errors
[11:08:38] <_zoggy_> 1.8.22 is out
[11:08:54] <_zoggy_> btw whoever wrote the 1.8.22 blog i think you meant to reference 1.9 at times....
[11:09:00] <_zoggy_> "This update brings bug fixes for Datepicker and Sortable, as well as adding support for jQuery 1.8. We‚Äôre doing this release while jQuery 1.8 is still in a pre-release state so that we can get better test coverage before the jQuery 1.8 stable release. If you‚Äôd like to test against jQuery 1.8..."
[11:10:20] <ajpiano> _zoggy_: where would it supposed to say 1.9
[11:10:28] <ajpiano> it's talking about compatibility with jQuery 1.8 the entire time
[11:10:40] <_zoggy_> We‚Äôre doing this release while jQuery 1.8 is still in a pre-release state so that we can get better test coverage before the jQuery 1.8 stable release.
[11:10:46] <_zoggy_> shouldnt that not say 1.9
[11:10:58] <_zoggy_> as 1.8 has been out for awhile.. and 1.8.x is just bugfixes
[11:11:04] <ajpiano> jQuery Core
[11:11:05] <ajpiano> 1.8
[11:11:07] <ajpiano> stable release
[11:11:19] <ravenzz> ^
[11:11:49] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  get anywhere?
[11:12:09] <_zoggy_> This update brings bug fixes for Datepicker and Sortable, as well as adding support for jQuery 1.8.
[11:12:20] <_zoggy_> since when did datepicker and sortable not work for 1.8...
[11:12:50] <Escherial> LindsayMac: i was kind of hoping someone else would pick up your cause, as i'm clearly not thinking very clearly today, heh...
[11:12:53] <ajpiano> _zoggy_: they're two separate things
[11:12:56] <Escherial> LindsayMac: i'll keep prodding it, though
[11:13:10] <ffrrnk> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN.. why didn't nobody not tell me, that the submit handler is bound to the FORM, not to the submit button...
[11:13:24] <ffrrnk> good night, i go to sleep
[11:13:31] <LindsayMac> Escherial:  no its cool.. i'll repost
[11:13:33] <snix> hey can you help me?
[11:13:37] <ravenzz> _zoggy_ also adding != replacing everything. It is made to be 1.8 compatible I guess
[11:13:45] <_zoggy_> need to update topic btw
[11:14:16] <snix> i have nested collapsibles. i have an onclick listener on all of them. if i click an inner collapsible the click seems to be catched by the outer collapsible though. do you have any idea how to solve this?
[11:14:26] <snix> or how inner/outer relations are usually resolved for onclick?
[11:14:33] <LindsayMac> I have this code I wrote with the help of a tutorial to get smooth scrolling for my "single page website" design and it works perfectly EXCEPT I want to be able to link to a div from outside of the page.. I tried using window.location.hash but I think im using it wrong. Any help is appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/sPTE3/
[11:14:38] <ajpiano> The update brings bug fixes for Sortable and Datepicker. The update also brings support for jQuery 1.8
[11:14:38] <snix> i would need something like click z-index
[11:14:43] <snix> if i am not mistaken
[11:14:49] <amirite> LindsayMac: how do you eat a div with chocolate
[11:14:49] <ravenzz> ?stopPropagation @ snix
[11:14:49] <snix> this seems to be a very tricky problem
[11:14:59] <amirite> you're a tricky problem
[11:15:00] <snix> ravenzz: oh how does this work?
[11:15:22] <ravenzz> like that http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[11:15:25] <snix> lolol nice ravenzz
[11:15:25] <LindsayMac> amirite:  easily? it;s covered in chocolate?
[11:15:33] <snix> i will try that, just call that in the handler right?
[11:15:41] <ravenzz> yup
[11:15:45] <ravenzz> read the doc
[11:16:12] <LindsayMac> I cant tell who is talking to whom
[11:16:21] <snix> ok this does not work
[11:16:33] <snix> because the event is never even associated with the inner div
[11:16:38] <snix> i tried
[11:16:50] <ravenzz> actually I am too lazy so I didn't read your question
[11:17:04] <ravenzz> I just had a look a some words lulz
[11:17:08] <ravenzz> let me read it
[11:17:11] <snix> "even.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event."
[11:17:22] <snix> the thing is i dont want to stop it bubbling the *up* the event tree
[11:17:32] <snix> i want to bubble it *down*
[11:17:37] <snix> it never even reaches this depth
[11:17:40] <LindsayMac> put a lid on it
[11:17:40] <tw2113> oh hey, peoples. I came in this room a decade ago and saw no one, bout time someone showed up
[11:17:42] <snix> i want it to reach the inner div though
[11:17:55] <LindsayMac> peoples?!
[11:17:57] <amirite> snix the solution is really ficking simple
[11:18:06] <amirite> just bind the event handler to the deepest element
[11:18:07] <snix> huh
[11:18:15] <snix> huuuh are you stooooopid amirite
[11:18:22] <amirite> i.e. instead of binding it to an <li> bind it to the <a> that's nested within the li
[11:18:25] <tw2113> is that offensive? should i go back to "extraterrestrials"?
[11:18:26] <ravenzz> snix so you click the parent and the child's one is trigged as well?
[11:18:28] <snix> amirite: i said it is bound to all divs of a type, and they are NESTED
[11:18:32] <NoiseEee> oh i was just about to help snix and then he called someone stupid :\
[11:18:45] <amirite> so bind it to the inner div
[11:18:48] <amirite> and not the outer div
[11:18:50] <amirite> dummy head
[11:18:50] <snix> ravenzz: wrong, i click the child and the parent catches it and the child doesnt get it ever
[11:18:59] <snix> but i need the child to catch it
[11:19:04] <pachet> i've never been to outer space, ever
[11:19:13] <hlveheart> man, jquery is really perverted
[11:19:14] <hlveheart> "<snix> but i need the child to catch it"
[11:19:15] <hlveheart> lol
[11:19:17] <LindsayMac> pachet:  is here!
[11:19:20] * LindsayMac bows to pachet 
[11:19:22] <snix> amirite: sorry are you retarded or trolling? i said i bind it to all of them, it is a potentially infinitely nested nesting
[11:19:29] <snix> i cannot just "bind it to the inner div"
[11:20:16] <NoiseEee> snix: you use .on() on the single parent container.  then you find out what element was clicked by inquiring about the event target, and take approrpriate action / dispatch to required functions
[11:20:32] <NoiseEee> snix: ONE element listening.
[11:20:54] <snix> NoiseEee: i want them all listening and just somethng like a z-index
[11:21:10] <ravenzz> snix so I was correct, http://jsfiddle.net/yDXpn/
[11:21:20] <snix> the highest z-index element should catch it, and obviously the innermost div should have the highest z-clickindex
[11:21:29] <NoiseEee> snix: its like people are saying 'hey drive a car' and you're all "but i love food"
[11:22:02] <pachet> yo dawg i heard you like food
[11:22:13] * pachet sits back down
[11:22:27] <snix> NoiseEee: no its like saying "hi can i make this car brake work because you know that would be cool feature and really useful and also kinda obvious" and people are all "duuuh noo just use your feet to brake and jump out of the car if its too fast lolololol DUMMY!!!!"
[11:23:00] <NoiseEee> snix: as if you're the first person to encounter this problem.
[11:23:18] <snix> ...
[11:23:35] <snix> such a mess
[11:23:53] <ravenzz> snix can you arrange a testcase?
[11:24:19] <NoiseEee> snix: also if you're doing 'nested collapsables' you should be achieving that effect by hiding/showing certain elements, not using z-index
[11:24:37] <snix> NoiseEee: z-index was only a metaphor
[11:24:55] <snix> for the click event catching precedences
[11:25:04] <snix> which are stupidly absent
[11:25:06] <snix> anyway
[11:27:06] <carp3> What's wrong with this code ? var val = $("#username").val();
[11:27:42] <xec_> carp3: on its own? nothing. what did you expect it to do, and what happens instead?
[11:27:49] <snix> wow this is so f*cking stupid
[11:28:05] <carp3> SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[11:28:05] <snix> NoiseEee: note that even.target remains always the same. which  is  the  very  problem.
[11:28:19] <snix> event.target*
[11:28:26] <carp3> xec_:  i get this error SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[11:28:50] <snix> this web thing is really a huge mess still
[11:28:52] <xec_> carp3: that doesn't make any sense from the tiny snippet you posted - something else is failing
[11:29:09] <xec_> carp3: do you have a live url?
[11:29:23] <LindsayMac> So if anyone has a moment to tell me what I did wrong with my window.location.hash code.. i would appreciate it. I am just learning still and can't understand why its not working http://jsfiddle.net/sPTE3/
[11:30:09] <NoiseEee> snix: http://jsfiddle.net/yDXpn/2/ good luck
[11:30:33] <carp3> xec_:  no. but this is the whole js that i have in my page. http://pastebin.ca/2174337
[11:31:45] <xec_> carp3: the end of line 3 is missing "function()"
[11:32:26] <xec_> carp3: .submit() takes a function as an argument, not an object literal
[11:32:40] <snix> thanks NoiseEee for your help
[11:32:49] <snix> i dont mean to be hating on jquery
[11:33:10] <snix> i just got a bit angry the last couple of hours because i noticed it is not really fully mature yet
[11:33:15] <snix> or the web in general
[11:33:19] <snix> but its nice
[11:33:21] <NoiseEee> snix: might i suggest it is your skills not yet mature.
[11:33:27] <NoiseEee> snix: everyone else is devving wonderful things.
[11:34:50] <snix> hehe
[11:35:13] <snix> thats what she said
[11:35:25] <gza_> i'm so confused by this anyone care to help
[11:35:41] <Brodingo> ?p @ gza_
[11:35:47] <Brodingo> ahem
[11:36:04] <xec_> bot-t offline apparently =(
[11:36:08] <Brodingo> jerk face

[11:36:47] <gza_> i changed the static file for some um css changes thats about it
[11:36:56] <Brodingo> gza_ paste some code or somethin dawg
[11:37:08] <LindsayMac> anyone who TYPES OUT 'um' ......
[11:37:15] <jedimind> umm
[11:37:18] <jedimind> is that okay?
[11:37:22] <Brodingo> UMMMMMUMUMUMUM
[11:37:23] <LindsayMac> in mid ummm sentance
[11:37:26] <jedimind> Brodingo, settle down
[11:37:48] <Brodingo> :O -> :|
[11:37:53] <gza_> ul
[11:38:00] <jedimind> i mean, umm Brodingo settle down
[11:38:07] <jedimind> l > ol
[11:38:10] <LindsayMac> its um
[11:38:16] <Brodingo> uhh ummm ok
[11:38:18] <jedimind> oh im um sorry
[11:38:29] <gza_> lol
[11:38:47] <LindsayMac> So anyone wanna help with my window.location.hash issue?
[11:39:04] <TheIronSky> nope!
[11:39:16] <Brodingo> dont you mean so ummmmmmm anyone wanna help with my window.location.hash issue?
[11:39:17] <TheIronSky> or perhaps I should speak for myself
[11:39:27] <LindsayMac> TheIronSky:  you took the words..
[11:39:35] <LindsayMac> Brodingo: um i suppose i um do
[11:39:43] <Brodingo> ok um thats um more like it
[11:40:08] <Brodingo> trying to get the hash in the url?
[11:40:10] <jedimind> you people are silly
[11:40:20] <jedimind> whats the problem LindsayMac ?
[11:40:33] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i got the hash in the url, but i can't get the window to go to that div when linking from an outside site or other page
[11:40:33] <gza_> I dont get why lindsaymac is so butthurt with me using um
[11:40:45] <xec_> gza_: do you have a live url that demonstrates the issue?
[11:40:55] <jedimind> LindsayMac, you have to have an onload event
[11:40:57] <jedimind> that checks
[11:40:59] <jedimind> much like the onclick event
[11:41:13] <jedimind> or if you want to hack it, just parse the URL
[11:41:21] <jedimind> and trigger click event on any anchor who's href matches the url
[11:41:30] <jedimind> which will then just trigger the click event you have for the smooth scroll
[11:41:33] <LindsayMac> jedimind: i am new.. so I am just learning the syntax of javascript... i know other languages.. so i am going to look up how to do that
[11:41:40] <jedimind> sorry, i meant "for the smooth um scroll"
[11:42:07] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  i dont thinmk i want to trigger anything AFTER a smooth scroll event.. I want to go there from outside the site.. so i might have just confused myself.
[11:42:16] <LindsayMac> an onload event makes sense because you want to go there immediately..
[11:42:21] <jedimind> yeah, what im saying is
[11:42:27] <jedimind> instead of repeating all the logic associated with scrolling
[11:42:28] <Brodingo> yeah i got that on my site http://brodingo.com/#abigail
[11:42:47] <jedimind> you create a new onload event that just determines the #hash (from the URL) you're trying to get to, finds the anchor on the page that links to it, and then just trigger it's already binded CLICK event
[11:42:50] <LindsayMac> KITTEH
[11:42:51] <LindsayMac> sorry..
[11:42:52] <jedimind> which will in turn trigger the smooth scroll
[11:42:54] <Brodingo> var hash = window.location.hash.slice(1); $("a[data-click='" + hash + "']").click();	
[11:42:55] <jedimind> instantly
[11:43:02] <jedimind> what Brodingo said
[11:43:16] <jedimind> except data-click
[11:43:18] <jedimind> will be href
[11:43:19] <LindsayMac> ah ok jedimind i understand what you are saying...
[11:43:59] <jedimind> Brodingo gave you a basic example encompassing what i um said
[11:44:31] <jedimind> PS if any of you are near/near enough to canadia
[11:44:34] <Brodingo> mines a bit different but the ideas the same
[11:44:36] <jedimind> http://www.jqueryto.com
[11:44:40] <jedimind> </shameless spam>
[11:46:10] <LindsayMac> i get it Brodingo and jedimind i am going to see how i work it into my code and play
[11:46:17] <LindsayMac> you have me enough to work with.. so I appreciaate it
[11:46:26] <Brodingo> ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm youre welcome
[11:47:13] <LindsayMac> um i like turtles
[11:47:15] <LindsayMac> um and kittehs
[11:47:20] <Brodingo> mreow
[11:47:27] <jedimind> you're in luck!
[11:47:33] <jedimind> i have a kitty that tastes exactly like turtle
[11:47:42] <LindsayMac> SWEET.. can we have her over for dinner?
[11:48:07] <LindsayMac> http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CF0QtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCMNry4PE93Y&ei=4O0OUNvtDuuN0QH97YHQBA&usg=AFQjCNEBXdPN7XorZdXzL1TDXSIAAMr3Hw
[11:48:09] <LindsayMac> OOPS~
[11:48:15] <LindsayMac> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y
[11:48:19] <gza_> OOOOOOOOOOOPS
[11:48:27] <jedimind> that kid makes me weep for humanity
[11:48:43] <jedimind> also im fairly certain he has some sort of skin condition
[11:48:49] <jedimind> he should consult a doctor or a dermatologist
[11:48:51] <jedimind> (sp?)
[11:49:15] <LindsayMac> or a zombieologist
[11:49:21] <jedimind> that's just silly
[11:49:22] <jedimind> stop being silly
[11:49:24] <LindsayMac> OMG I JUST HAD A MOMENT!
[11:49:25] <jedimind> this is serious work
[11:49:30] <LindsayMac> HE IS PATIENT ZERO !!!
[11:49:35] <jedimind> lol
[11:49:36] <Brodingo> #jquery srs biz
[11:49:37] <LindsayMac> Quick.. tell the people in Miami!
[11:49:50] <jedimind> no, dont tell them, with any luck, they'll all get infested and eat each other
[11:49:50] <LindsayMac> it wasnt the bath salts guy! IT WAS TURTLE BOY!
[11:49:59] <gza_> cool story bro
[11:50:01] * LindsayMac secretly hopes for a zombie apocalypse 
[11:50:10] <jedimind> i own an island, im set for zombies
[11:50:27] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  have you read world war z? Zombies can make it to islands!
[11:50:46] <LindsayMac> I am prepping for a city in the trees complete with dumbwaiters and trap doors
[11:50:49] <jedimind> yeah well, i dont subscribe to that theory
[11:51:03] <jedimind> and i have read it, but you cant just take it all at face value
[11:51:13] <tensory> hello non-zombie people
[11:51:17] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  if they don't die.... then how does water stop them?
[11:51:24] <jedimind> it doesnt, but they cant float
[11:51:27] <LindsayMac> they might float / bob around
[11:51:29] <tensory> i am here from #sass because #sass is dead
[11:51:34] <HassanS> just surround yourself with blondes.  It's like hiding in the desert
[11:51:37] <tensory> does anybody work with scss/compass here?
[11:51:41] <jedimind> also they consist of meat, so the aminals in the water will eat them by the time they reach my island
[11:51:44] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  they could be underwater being pulled around and get washed asore...
[11:51:53] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE ZOMBIE SHARKS!
[11:51:53] <jedimind> tensory, yeah tons of people, you might be better off in #css though
[11:51:58] <tensory> orite.
[11:52:12] <jedimind> yeah but zombie sharks are fine (and also the next Syfy movie i hope)
[11:52:13] <FernandoBasso> Is it possibl to disable dataTables search field?
[11:52:14] <jedimind> because they cant walk on land
[11:52:21] <jedimind> FernandoBasso, probably
[11:52:27] <LindsayMac> but how will you eat without fishing ?
[11:52:35] <LindsayMac> if you live on an island you eventuall have to go in the water
[11:53:04] <jedimind> on a boat
[11:53:12] <LindsayMac> Sharks can bite through a boat
[11:53:13] <gza_> on a motherfuckin boattt
[11:53:14] <jedimind> i think we may be getting a little off topic
[11:53:19] <LindsayMac> espcially zombie ones that are HUNGRY
[11:53:30] <LindsayMac> sorry.. zombie obsessed..
[11:53:41] <LindsayMac> AND one last thing..
[11:54:09] <imachuchu> ok, so now I have a completely working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/7/ Try to add a new entry (fill in name, count, weight), then try to use the autocomplete on the new entry, it's a no go
[11:54:16] <LindsayMac> MOST animals that eat flesh will mostly NO eat rotten or contaminated flesh.. especially the sea creatures that eat flesh. Its a survival instinct.. and since zombies well.. stink like death..
[11:54:28] <jedimind> "i have a working fiddle", he announce proudly
[11:54:44] <imachuchu> can somebody, if they understand query ui's autocomplete tell me how to get around this, or update the fiddle so that it works
[11:54:51] <ajpiano> imachuchu: clone-based templating is a really... bad approach to templating
[11:54:55] <imachuchu> jedimind: it's been 3 days of this problem
[11:54:55] <jedimind> LindsayMac, there are numerous creatures in the seas that DO in fact eat rotten flesh
[11:55:01] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  I have a WEIRD thing happening.. I implemented that code and changed it to a{href and strangely now, it works in a flash and then goes back..
[11:55:06] <imachuchu> a working fiddle out of my code is an accomplishment
[11:55:17] <Escherial> zombies are going to have some serious problems contending with life
[11:55:32] <Escherial> unless they're animated by magic and not science
[11:55:32] <Brodingo> LindsayMac is it in a doc ready or window load?
[11:55:33] <ajpiano> imachuchu: just call .autocomplete() with the same options on the new element after you clone
[11:55:50] <LindsayMac> doc ready
[11:55:52] <LindsayMac> slinks away
[11:55:53] <imachuchu> ajpiano: give me a few to update the fiddle
[11:56:13] <ajpiano> but realistically, cloning elements and jiggering around with them in order to create a new element, is a really bad approach to templating
[11:57:12] <imachuchu> ajpiano: for background this is coming through django's formset, what would you suggest instead?
[11:57:17] <jedimind> i jigger things all the time
[11:57:25] <Vooloo> is it possible to get 100% iframe in a jquery dialog?
[11:57:30] <jedimind> ajpiano, i brought you up in a discussion last night w/ someone
[11:57:46] <jedimind> i was talking about jquery super stars out there and how they are like rock stars and have groupies
[11:57:53] <jedimind> and then i was like "I mean look at this beautiful man"
[11:57:56] <jedimind> and pulled up a pic of you
[11:58:02] <jedimind> i may have been a little drunk
[11:58:14] <ajpiano> imachuchu: you could have the "template" for a row be put into a <script type="template"> or some other way where you can consume it with a client side templating library like the one included in underscore.js or handlebars.js etd
[11:58:19] <ajpiano> jedimind: loool
[11:58:45] <jedimind> true story man
[11:58:55] <jedimind> you know what the weird thing is, it was a discussion i was having with my parents
[11:58:56] <jedimind> hahah
[11:58:59] <LindsayMac> Ok so I added it to the window.load and it kinda works.. I can refresh and it will stay on that page, but the first time I go to it (as if I were coming from an outside of the site link) it my domain would be mydomain.com/#kitchen and no matter what, it will go to mydomain.com/#content
[11:59:18] <LindsayMac> #content is my container/wrapper for the whole site but its not referenced anywhere as a selector for that code.. so im confusedf
[11:59:22] <FernandoBasso> Oh. bFilter and bPaginate is what I am looking for.
[12:00:38] <gf3> WAT
[12:00:38] <b-ot> oh, yeah that wouldn't be, if not deliminated
[12:00:50] <imachuchu> ajpiano: there you go, now reattaches after the new object is created, still won't work: http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/8/
[12:01:37] <imachuchu> still not to sure on variable scoping for js, so I just used a new one created right beforehand
[12:02:26] <gza_> what can cause a plugin to stop functioning properly
[12:02:41] <pachet> nothing
[12:02:41] <gza_> bugs?
[12:02:44] <pachet> they are impervious to error
[12:02:56] <pachet> crafted in the ancient smithies of the gods
[12:02:57] <Brodingo> maybe if ants are attacking your hard drive
[12:03:09] <ajpiano> imachuchu: you realise this fiddle doesn't actually work right
[12:03:15] <ajpiano> it throws up 404s for all the js resource requests
[12:03:22] <ajpiano> and then nothing autocompletes
[12:03:23] <ajpiano> sooo
[12:03:39] <imachuchu> ajpiano: works fine on my computer
[12:03:49] <ajpiano> cool
[12:03:57] <ajpiano> i'll go back to working fine on my computer then ;)
[12:04:02] <imachuchu> ajpiano: well, except the problem I'm having
[12:04:24] <ajpiano> imachuchu: in gnereal jquery ui widgets aren't big fans of being cloned
[12:04:40] <ajpiano> i wouldn't be particularly surprised if cloning it isn't letting the new one instantiat properly
[12:04:49] <ajpiano> yet another reason to avoid clone based templating
[12:05:42] <imachuchu> ajpiano: I removed the vestigal includes and tested it in another browser, http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/9/
[12:05:49] <Progster> i reload my page and I immediately get a DOMException in chrome. WTF did I just do?
[12:06:10] <Progster> SYNTAX_ERR: DOM Exception 12"
[12:06:54] <ajpiano> Progster: you tell us
[12:07:09] <Progster> no idea honeslty. not sure how to debug either.
[12:07:21] <ajpiano> so your website just magically stopped working
[12:07:25] <ajpiano> without you changing anything
[12:07:52] <Progster> oh I changed things.
[12:08:11] <ajpiano> that's what i meant by "you tell us"
[12:08:27] <Progster> last thing I did was append($('<button>Go</button>').attr('class', 'go')) to a div
[12:08:50] <ajpiano> imachuchu: none of these fields are autocompleting for me :(
[12:09:08] <ajpiano> imachuchu: oh there we go
[12:09:09] <ajpiano> BI
[12:09:13] <LindsayMac> Ok so I have this code.. and it includes code for some smooth scrolling to div container.. the issue is that if I go to mydomain.com/#someid it ALWAYS flashes to mydomain.com/#content for no reason I can see http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/4/
[12:10:32] <Progster> taking out all of the js on my page doesn't make it go away
[12:11:04] <ajpiano> Progster: unfortunately we can't deduce the problem from knowing nothing about your code and not seeing a live demo etc
[12:11:25] <ajpiano> "I had some JS, I had an error, I removed the JS, I had an error" is not something strangers can typically assist with
[12:11:53] <imachuchu> brb
[12:12:15] <ajpiano> ImBcmDth: damndsjklfnasdk;lfjsdaf
[12:12:23] <ajpiano> imachuchu damnit
[12:12:36] <ajpiano> imachuchu: your selector isn't matching any elements
[12:12:40] <imachuchu> ajpiano: any ideas?
[12:12:55] <thang> ajpiano: https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs/
[12:13:10] <LindsayMac> anyone with thoughts as to why it will not keep the proper hash in the url when viewing a new page here @pud_ca
[12:13:13] <LindsayMac> LOL OOPS!
[12:13:23] <LindsayMac> HERE: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/4/
[12:13:24] <ajpiano> LindsayMac: you need to seriously tone down the frequency with which you repeat your questions
[12:13:41] <LindsayMac> ajpiano:  I only ask every so often because its busy.. chillax
[12:13:54] <ajpiano> multiple times in ten minutes is not "every so often"
[12:13:57] <LindsayMac> things get buried sometimes. This isn't my first rodeo.
[12:14:06] <imachuchu> ajpiano: fixed that bug, still no work: http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/10/
[12:14:16] <LindsayMac> 3 times in 10 minutes with a simple line of text isn't overkill either.
[12:15:00] <ajpiano> LindsayMac: it's overkill if i say it's overkill..it's also overkill according to pretty mcuh every thing i'v ever seen about IRC etiquette
[12:15:23] <LindsayMac> thanks for warning me sir king of #jquery .. ?
[12:15:35] <LindsayMac> i will kindly take your advice and move forth
[12:15:36] <danheberden> you forgot the word majesty
[12:15:38] <gf3> Sassy
[12:15:41] <thang> ‡≤†_‡≤†
[12:15:48] <Brodingo> and capitalize that shit!
[12:15:53] <LindsayMac> lol Brodingo
[12:16:13] <Brodingo> im srs -> :|
[12:16:17] <ajpiano> imachuchu: how could you have fixed "that bug"
[12:16:22] <LindsayMac> hey Brodingo.. i would ask you for helps but I will get yelled at
[12:16:31] <danheberden> i would say that the one person in here who has spent the most time out of all of us helping people with jQuery is indeed the king
[12:16:32] <ajpiano> imachuchu: the selector that isn't matching is the one to select the new "name" field in the new row
[12:16:41] <LindsayMac> i used your code and thought i put it the right place, but its doing something really strange
[12:16:55] <Brodingo> on the fiddle, whats going wrong?
[12:17:02] <ajpiano> imachuchu: realistically you should just be doing $(row).find(".nodcAutocomplete").autocomplete({})
[12:17:11] <danheberden> and that someone that doesn't respect that fact is, indeed, not being very polite to the hours and hours that person has spent contributing to the success of jQuery and everyone using it
[12:17:20] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i am not sure the fiddle shows it but here: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/4/
[12:17:38] <imachuchu> ajpiano: the problem (I suspected) was that I haddn't copied over exactly the expression for the new row, which was true. Let me try the find method you suggested
[12:17:49] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  what is happening is that when I go to my site from outside of the main domain, I will go to a url like mydomain.com/#team and it will ALWAYS revert to mydomain.com/#content which i guess is the parent container element
[12:17:56] <ravenzz> dangerousdave++
[12:17:59] <Ontolog> So I want to setup a $('#some-input').change(function() { ‚Ä¶ }), but I don't want it to run on *every* change. For example, if someone is typing really fast, I want there to be an 0.5 second delay before the change function runs and the last time the user typed.
[12:18:01] <LindsayMac> but no where in my code do i see reference to the parent
[12:18:13] <gf3> LOL custom selector madness
[12:18:20] <gf3> 'a[href*=#]:not(.noscroll)'
[12:18:26] <Brodingo> if you can get the weirdness to happen in the fiddle we can be helpy
[12:18:26] <gf3> Fuckin' jQuery
[12:18:33] <imachuchu> (#id_name-" + formNum + "-oldName) vs (#id_form-" + formNum + "-oldName)
[12:18:41] <LindsayMac> gf3: that is to make sure I dont scroll to a tab
[12:19:04] <ajpiano> Ontolog: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[12:19:05] <LindsayMac> but uyea.. I am just learning so appreciate if someone tells me i 'm doing it wrong/
[12:19:15] <LindsayMac> I could have easily copy and paste pirated a smooth scroll but i wanted to learn as i went
[12:19:17] <ajpiano> Ontolog: the technique you need is known as debouncing, you can use that plugin or do it manually using timeouts
[12:19:17] <gf3> LindsayMac: There are better ways to structure this, pushing logic into strings can be brittle
[12:19:18] <danheberden> *cough*
[12:19:29] <BFranks> OMG.. So if I have a script that is dynamically generating elements to apply jquery functions to, the script has to pass back an index of the functions so that the calling page can attach functions to the elements.. ? Eeep.. So much work. ;)
[12:19:30] <Ontolog> ajpiano: thanks!
[12:20:00] <gf3> LindsayMac: I'd vote on delegating from the document and checking the link.hash
[12:20:15] <LindsayMac> gf3:  you might have to dumb that down a little for me
[12:20:29] <ajpiano> BFranks: i haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about and lack the inclination to find out more, however you can rest assured that modern web app development does not involve anything called "passing back the index of the functions" so you can "apply jquery functions" to "dynamicalyl generated elements."
[12:20:44] <jedimind> gf3 explain it like you were talking to a 5 year old
[12:20:51] <jedimind> a zombie loving um 5 year old
[12:20:53] <ajpiano> there are many ways to "apply jquery" to dynamically generated elements, none of which involve "passing back indexes"
[12:20:54] <LindsayMac> lol jedimind
[12:21:19] <LindsayMac> im not entirely code stupid. I can do some magic with php...
[12:21:32] <danheberden> writing php IS magic
[12:21:37] <Brodingo> i hate magic
[12:21:41] <danheberden> it's like building a house with toothpics
[12:21:42] <LindsayMac> to me, writing javascript is magic
[12:21:42] <Brodingo> apparently
[12:21:49] <LindsayMac> i feel the same about js ..
[12:21:58] <danheberden> i won't dare correct you
[12:22:02] <imachuchu> ajpiano: still no workey, http://jsfiddle.net/F49nG/11/ And thank you very much for helping/staying with me as long as you have
[12:22:06] <pachet> LindsayMac: i dont know if someone is helping you already or not, but have a look at jsfiddle.net/YDM6g/
[12:22:22] <LindsayMac> pachet:  to the rescue
[12:22:57] <jedimind> MY HERO
[12:22:58] * jedimind swoons
[12:23:03] <LindsayMac> pachet:  yours is so much simpler than mine..
[12:23:12] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  you have no IDEA how much to the rescue pachet has come!
[12:23:22] <BFranks> Yeah since my strength is with PHP I initially coded the <script> block on the AJAX page.. Now I could pass that back to JS via the AJAX call and eval() it.. or I could just walk the DOM tree for the refreshed content and attach the functions to the result.. If I knew more JS.. ;)
[12:23:24] <Brodingo> _so_ to the rescue
[12:23:43] <LindsayMac> //soooo///// to the rescue..
[12:23:48] <LindsayMac> like, um , totally
[12:23:51] <pachet> :[
[12:23:57] <pachet> just doing my civic duty
[12:24:20] <LindsayMac> :D
[12:24:33] <BFranks> Lemme see if I can make a jsfiddle example.. perhaps with a nudge in the right direction I can do this 'properly' vs. 'cludge' .. ;P
[12:24:42] * jedimind throws his manpanties at pachet 
[12:24:56] <jedimind> oh! funny story, i got my first groupie the other day when i presented to a bunch of peeps on html5 forms
[12:24:59] <jedimind> i guess that's a hot topic for women
[12:25:08] <jedimind> she started stalking me afterwards, getting in touch with my work colleagues asking about me
[12:25:09] * pachet swallows them from midair in a single gulp
[12:25:23] <ajpiano> BFranks: writing your JS in PHP cause you're better at PHP is like jumping out of a plane with a quilt instead of a parachute cause you're good at knitting
[12:25:24] <Brodingo> jedimind awwwwww yeah harem of web groupies
[12:25:39] <danheberden> more like harm of web groupies
[12:25:41] <danheberden> watch out
[12:25:52] <Brodingo> yikes!
[12:26:19] <LindsayMac> pachet:  you've been practicing ;)
[12:26:41] <jedimind> yeah, that was quite impressive considering the size
[12:26:54] <LindsayMac> granny panties.
[12:27:04] <jedimind> ITS LAUNDRY DAY
[12:27:06] <jedimind> DONT MAKE FUN
[12:27:41] <BFranks> ajpiano: Ahhh I still have a fiddle from yesterday: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/44/  .. The table data is loaded via an AJAX call to a PHP script which builds the table from the most current MySQL data.. For each 'user choice' I need to make a function call like the two in the fiddle under the "//MENUS" comment.. If I can just do this dynamically with a small routine in JS it'd save a lot of time.
[12:27:42] <LindsayMac> BFranks:  i read something somewhere.. i think it was on the topic of jqueryUI tabs about a function that refreshes the function when elements have been added to the DOM
[12:28:25] <Aut0Exec> hi guys... with jquery ui... dialogbox ... can i send server data to this?
[12:29:24] <ajpiano> BFranks: you certainly can, but I can't assist right now.
[12:29:54] <jedimind> fuck its 3:30pm
[12:29:57] <jedimind> i havent done dick today
[12:30:00] <BFranks> Like a foreach on any table > tr > td > span with the class 'jqmenu' .. take the 'id' and make the function ?
[12:30:20] <Brodingo> jedimind you brightened the hearts and minds of irc
[12:30:20] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  i'll give you some work
[12:30:34] <BFranks> jedimind: if it helps it's only 12:30 on the pacific coast?
[12:30:44] <ajpiano> $("table td span.jqmenu").each(function() { console.log ( this.id ); });
[12:30:48] <jedimind> i mean to that chicks defense, i did look pretty hot presenting
[12:30:48] <jedimind> http://bnotions.com/ixd-responsive-design-presentation/
[12:30:49] <pachet> jedimind: you nourished me
[12:31:00] <LindsayMac> that chicK?
[12:31:02] <BFranks> ajpiano: Super thanks!
[12:31:45] <jedimind> LindsayMac, http://i.imgur.com/NU8XR.png
[12:31:56] <LindsayMac> LMAO jedimind
[12:32:05] <LindsayMac> that is AWESOME.. i am reposting to my zombie blog
[12:32:20] <imachuchu> ajpiano: umm, any ideas on my problem, or should I scrap the whole thing and rebuild using a templating library?
[12:32:37] <imachuchu> or maybe find a different autocomplete function that doesn't hate clonging so much
[12:32:43] <imachuchu> *cloning
[12:33:21] <ajpiano> imachuchu: basically, yeah... even if i could hack at this for a long time and get it to work
[12:33:25] <ajpiano> this methodology is so flawed :(
[12:33:52] <imachuchu> ajpiano: yeah but my boss wants it done soon. oh well
[12:34:04] <imachuchu> ajpiano: thank you very much for your time anyway
[12:34:11] <ajpiano> ?ydinop
[12:34:11] <bot-t> Your Deadline Is Not Our Problem
[12:34:13] <ajpiano> :)
[12:34:19] <NoiseEee> heh
[12:34:25] <imachuchu> ajpiano: didn't say it was, but it is my problem
[12:34:34] <ajpiano> i know :) you're welcome for the assistance so far
[12:34:40] <LindsayMac> pachet:  strangely.. the code you posted on fiddle doesnt work on my site..
[12:35:52] <Aut0Exec> help someone
[12:35:54] <Aut0Exec> please
[12:35:55] <Aut0Exec> ?
[12:36:04] <NoiseEee> okay done! i helped someone!!!
[12:36:12] <NoiseEee> Samaritan++
[12:36:24] <Aut0Exec> :|
[12:36:41] <ajpiano> Aut0Exec: the answer to your question is 'Yes'
[12:36:48] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: lol
[12:36:51] * jedimind throws panties at NoiseEee too
[12:37:02] <ajpiano> it's possible to send data to the server using the ui dialog, it's like *any other element on your page*
[12:37:08] <ajpiano> just stick a form in there and do whatever you want
[12:37:09] <Aut0Exec> i just want to know if i can put server into to jquery dialog box
[12:37:11] <Aut0Exec> ui
[12:37:22] <ajpiano> you can also put server data into it
[12:37:31] <gf3> LindsayMac: Like so ‚Üí http://jsfiddle.net/cuAsU/
[12:37:36] <jedimind> i think he wants to physically cram a 1u server into a dialog box
[12:38:14] <pifantastic> I would use an ec2 micro
[12:38:15] <LindsayMac> gf3:  not sure what you are showing me? I'm not doing anything with tabs. Just smooth scrolling to an anchor link
[12:38:19] <pifantastic> that should fit in most dialogs
[12:38:24] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: i was looking at the docs but i dont see how to load data from server to it
[12:38:35] <ajpiano> Aut0Exec: you do a normal ajax request and then call dialog on it
[12:38:40] <gf3> LindsayMac: You would do whatever the hell you're doing in there
[12:38:45] <gf3> LindsayMac: It doesn't matter
[12:38:54] <gf3> LindsayMac: It's just a better way of dealing with your links
[12:39:01] <ajpiano> $("<div>").load("foo.php", function() { $(this).dialog();  })
[12:39:02] <ajpiano> for example
[12:39:08] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: ahhh ok
[12:39:20] <LindsayMac> gf3:  ok.. i am going to look at it more closely again
[12:40:23] <nerk> hi, is there any way to extract specific elements from html chunks when calling $.get?  eg. $.get('somepage', function(data) { alert($('title,data).text()); });
[12:41:01] <nerk> I know about load and reading specific elements (fragments)
[12:41:04] <ajpiano> nerk: in general yes, but when consuming entire html pages with jQuery( foo ) things get a bit trickeier
[12:41:04] * jedimind hugs nerk 
[12:41:09] <nerk> but I want a fragment from one piece of the document
[12:41:12] <nerk> and a fragment from another
[12:41:13] <pifantastic> nerk $(data).find('title');
[12:41:18] <nerk> so calling it twice seems stupid
[12:41:33] <nerk> hey jedi
[12:41:38] <nerk> hrrm
[12:41:43] <nerk> tried $(data).find()
[12:41:44] <nerk> failed
[12:42:15] <LindsayMac> gf3:  i think your code has confused me further. You have an on(click) function but I am looking to do it on(load) or when you get to the page.. If I click mydomain.com/#team from, say, facebook.com -- i would like to do that my page and have that div centered in the window.
[12:42:15] <nerk> I can get it to work via the html5 output tag.. dumping data there first.. then extracting
[12:42:22] <nerk> but js is attempting to run in output
[12:42:24] <ajpiano> nerk: is data an entire HTML document
[12:42:30] <nerk> ajpiano: yes
[12:42:34] <ajpiano> nerk:  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784  https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-htmldoc.js
[12:42:35] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: quick quesiton... in your example.. what would ("<div>") represent?
[12:42:44] <ajpiano> Aut0Exec: a brand new div that you created to load data into
[12:42:51] <LindsayMac> pachet:  your solutions works but requires each link to have a variable manually added so I need to figure out a way to dynamically get those just in case they want to add new pages
[12:42:54] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: would .load() be better suited to his needs?
[12:42:55] <LindsayMac> "pages"
[12:42:59] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: ahh ok so that can be anything?
[12:43:00] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, I'm not sure exactly what you're doing, but I wonder if Ben Alman's BBQ plugin would help?
[12:43:01] <nerk> if I used load
[12:43:05] <nerk> then I am making to requests
[12:43:07] <ajpiano> Aut0Exec: yep
[12:43:12] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: ahhh ok awesome
[12:43:14] <nerk> as I need a fragment from the head, and a fragment from the body
[12:43:17] <MistuhKurtz> It creates a "hashchange" event and has some other tools for dealing with URL hashes
[12:43:30] <nerk> err. s/to requests/two requests/
[12:43:35] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  that plugin was suggested.> i was trying to learn it and NOT use a copy paste solution.. thats all
[12:43:37] <BFranks> ajpiano: Yay.. works perfectly.. I even gave you props in the script comments. ;)  http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/46/
[12:43:59] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: if anything load would have the same bad assumption built in, wrt to that it can parse an entire html doc
[12:44:10] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, what's your fiddle URL?
[12:44:15] <ajpiano> nerk: what you want is probably to do the $.get, then parse the string with ben's htmlDoc plugin
[12:44:18] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: last question... i promise... is this the most effective and easy way of displaying a form?
[12:44:18] <nerk> ajpiano: they suggest filter
[12:44:18] <ajpiano> and then search through that twice
[12:44:29] <gf3> nerk: http://jsfiddle.net/RE5hL/
[12:44:36] <nerk> is filter a bad performance hit?
[12:44:40] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  this is mine http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/anFRB/4/
[12:44:43] <ajpiano> nerk: no
[12:44:51] <pifantastic> nerk: why not return JSON with the two pieces of HTML?
[12:44:54] <nerk> maybe I just use that then
[12:45:00] <haizum> can someone take a look at my site and help me figure out why my isotope plugin isn't sorting properly
[12:45:01] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  this is another one pachet made which is pretty much what I need but has the variables manually entered http://jsfiddle.net/YDM6g/
[12:45:02] <pachet> LindsayMac: oh i see. are you able to do anything to reduce the number of possible links down to a more reasonable number?
[12:45:02] <haizum> http://pastebin.com/kwBxEz0M
[12:45:07] <nerk> pifantastic: cuz I am not attempting to build a system based on json
[12:45:10] <pachet> LindsayMac: those blanket attribute selectors are so ugly :[
[12:45:11] <haizum> site is http://www.richardbernardin.com/portfolio
[12:45:13] <nerk> but I agree, that would work
[12:45:14] <gf3> LindsayMac: My code doesn't care about load or not, it will work on all links always
[12:45:15] <LindsayMac> pachet:  its not an unreasonable number but they can change.
[12:45:18] <pifantastic> nerk: but you seem to be slightly abusing HTML
[12:45:28] <nerk> how so?
[12:45:49] <LindsayMac> gf3:  your code wasn't making sense as to how I can work it in with my current solution. Its my fault.. I know this..
[12:45:51] <ryanneufeld> haizum: looks fine here...
[12:45:57] <ryanneufeld> haizum: very fine indeed...
[12:46:05] <MistuhKurtz> No shame in using plugins. It's far better to have the knowledge to hook into plugins and accomplish what you want using them, than to try and write stuff from scratch
[12:46:25] <gf3> LindsayMac: My code wasn't a solution to the question you asked, just an improvement on a different aspect of your code
[12:46:33] <haizum> ryanneufeld, ya but its not sorting right... all the links at the top do is make the one image of the guy sort to the top... and then they won't sort back
[12:46:33] <ryanneufeld> haizum: might want to attach an NSFW warning for people though
[12:46:51] <LindsayMac> gf3:  ok.. well I understand but again.. its abstract enough where I can't fully grasp how to USE your solution
[12:46:51] <haizum> ryanneufeld, yaya, that's all for later
[12:47:04] <ryanneufeld> haizum: they all have the same data-category
[12:47:09] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i understand that.. but I would rather use plugins AFTER i understand the concept...
[12:47:10] <ryanneufeld> haizum: perhaps that's why?
[12:47:13] <haizum> ryanneufeld, no they don't
[12:47:15] <MistuhKurtz> Yeah LindsayMac I wouldn't try to match URLs and what not
[12:47:25] <nerk> $(data).filter(target); is working great
[12:47:29] <MistuhKurtz> At the very least, I would use Ben Alman's hashchange event plugin
[12:47:30] <ryanneufeld> haizum: I'm sorry, all but one is different
[12:47:31] <nerk> and keeps me at one request
[12:47:32] <nerk> thanks
[12:47:34] <haizum> ryanneufeld, most of them do but there is an image in 'Advertising' and one in 'Films'
[12:47:43] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  ok.
[12:47:45] <nerk> I think the time it takes to regex the blob
[12:47:52] <haizum> rest are in 'Editorial'
[12:47:53] <nerk> is better than several requests
[12:48:51] <MistuhKurtz> $(window).on('hashchange', function(){ /* Animate my elements into place */ }).trigger('hashchange');
[12:48:56] <SP33D> hello is it possible with jquery to search for a code snippet like ">Base</a> and replace it with ">XXXXX</a>
[12:49:03] <ryanneufeld> haizum: your links have it in lowercases but the data attrs are upper case
[12:49:11] <ryanneufeld> haizum: try using all lowercase
[12:49:36] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  working on it
[12:49:45] <pifantastic> SP33D: $(':contains("Base")').text('XXXXX');
[12:49:49] <MistuhKurtz> Does that make sense? do you see the benefit, LindsayMac ?
[12:50:12] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  it makes sense a little..i just usually google or read in to what I dont fully understand
[12:50:27] <pifantastic> SP33D: http://jsfiddle.net/Adpdq/3/
[12:50:37] <MistuhKurtz> Check out the docs for jQuery BBQ and Hashchange (both by Ben Alman)
[12:50:38] <MistuhKurtz> read the code
[12:50:40] <pifantastic> SP33D: although it's much better to use an ID
[12:50:52] <pifantastic> because :contains is going to be waaaay slower
[12:50:54] <SP33D> pifantastic: that will replace only the text i need to search for the exact code snippet
[12:50:55] <ryanneufeld> haizum: did you get that?
[12:50:58] <SP33D> and replace it with other html
[12:50:59] <SP33D> ^^
[12:51:03] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  thats what im doing
[12:51:11] <SP33D> i only did the XXX for showing what i mean since my english sucks
[12:51:13] <haizum> ryanneufeld, ya that wasnt it, same behaviour
[12:51:33] <ryanneufeld> haizum: you're usng isotope?
[12:51:37] <pifantastic> SP33D: I don't understand what you mean. Did you look at the fiddle?
[12:51:42] <haizum> ryanneufeld, yes
[12:51:51] <haizum> ryanneufeld, did you not see my pastebin?
[12:51:53] <SP33D> right
[12:51:54] <haizum> http://pastebin.com/kwBxEz0M
[12:51:58] <pifantastic> SP33D: you can make the selector more specific http://jsfiddle.net/Adpdq/4/
[12:52:04] <ajpiano> SP33D: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-replacetext-plugin/
[12:52:15] <pifantastic> ajpiano to the rescue
[12:52:42] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, if I had an employee working on this, I would *much* rather them use a tried-and-true plugin (Ben Alman is a great plugin author) to help accomplish their needs. a) the plugin has been well-vetted, tested, debugged, b) it will take less time, c) it will be easier to maintain in the future, etc.
[12:53:14] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i am going to ultimately simply include Ariel Fleiser's simple scroll. i just wanted to use my own for dev and learning...
[12:53:22] <SP33D> pif:antastic ok i tell you what i need exactly is <a>Base</a> gets replaced with <a>Base<img src></a>
[12:53:32] <SP33D> i need to put html into that
[12:53:42] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  this WHOLE PROJECT had the purpose of being a javascript learning tool for myself
[12:54:02] <pifantastic> SP33D: if you can give that element a class or an ID, it will be much easier
[12:54:08] <MistuhKurtz> what's simple scroll LindsayMac ? I know of scrollTo, localScroll
[12:54:12] <SP33D> i cant that is the problem
[12:54:13] <SP33D> ^^
[12:54:19] <ajpiano> SP33D: if you use this replaceText plugin it will make that quite simple
[12:54:21] <SP33D> its a variable thing
[12:54:26] <haizum> ryanneufeld, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/sorting.html
[12:54:27] <LindsayMac> Sorry i meant localScroll
[12:54:59] <SP33D> ajpiano where is the replace plugin your talking about

[12:55:25] <ryanneufeld> haizum: you're not telling it what you want to sort by
[12:55:28] <ryanneufeld> only that you want category
[12:55:42] <ryanneufeld> haizum: look at the last block of example code
[12:55:53] <SP33D> Note that only text content will be modified, leaving all tags and attributes untouched.
[12:55:58] <SP33D> that dont works
[12:55:58] <SP33D> :D
[12:56:03] <pifantastic> SP33D: http://jsfiddle.net/Adpdq/5/
[12:56:07] <ryanneufeld> haizum: and compare that to lines 18/19 of your pastie
[12:56:07] <SP33D> i wanna add HTML to HTML
[12:56:09] <pifantastic> that's using ben_alman's plugin
[12:56:15] <ajpiano> SP33D: jeez
[12:56:21] <ajpiano> SP33D: it won't change thigns that you DON'T WANT IT TO CHANGE
[12:56:30] <ajpiano> SP33D: if you want to insert HTML where just the text was, you can do that.
[12:56:53] <ajpiano> it's just saying that if you want to change all instances of "dog" to "cat" you can do that and it won't break the rest of the html in your page
[12:56:56] <pifantastic> SP33D: yep, I recommend actually reading the information at that URL
[12:57:04] <haizum> ryanneufeld, yes i changed sortName to category
[12:57:13] <haizum> ryanneufeld, if i keep it as sortName it doesn't do jack shit
[12:57:14] <ryanneufeld> haizum: yeah, that's your problem
[12:57:19] <MistuhKurtz> well LindsayMac scrollTo/localScroll and BBQ/hashchange do sort of have separate concerns
[12:57:40] <ryanneufeld> haizum: cause you had capitalized category names
[12:57:53] <haizum> so?
[12:57:55] <ryanneufeld> haizum: with lower case, and sortName it should work
[12:58:09] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i am pretty certain, however, that localScroll and scrollTo have both the ability to link to a div container
[12:58:10] <haizum> well its easier for me to just capitalize the href hash
[12:58:14] <haizum> which i just did
[12:58:16] <haizum> and still doesn't work
[12:58:18] <ryanneufeld> haizum: okay
[12:58:24] <ryanneufeld> haizum: did you change it to sortname?
[12:58:26] <SP33D> pifantastic i was looking at your last example it looks like that what i whant the problem is i am not sre
[12:58:28] <haizum> yes
[12:58:34] <ryanneufeld> k, is it live?
[12:58:36] <SP33D> i try it when it works it will make me happy
[12:58:36] <haizum> sec
[12:58:38] <SP33D> ^^
[12:58:50] <pifantastic> SP33D: just remember to include the plugin
[12:58:52] <haizum> ryanneufeld, yes it is now
[12:59:00] <pifantastic> https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-replacetext/master/jquery.ba-replacetext.js
[12:59:04] <pifantastic> SP33D: ^
[12:59:05] <e-anima> i am getting some values on click like  $("body").click(function (e) { ... the problem is i need the collected values outside the function. any tips?
[12:59:26] <haizum> ryanneufeld, buttons don't do anything now
[12:59:26] <ryanneufeld> haizum: add condole.log(this); before line 18
[12:59:47] <SP33D> damn but the selector
[12:59:57] <SP33D> is so wrong that i can't imagine the right one
[12:59:59] <MistuhKurtz> e-anima, you should initiliaze the var outside of the function
[13:00:05] <e-anima> ah ok thx
[13:00:21] <Aut0Exec> cant download jquery ui
[13:00:21] <Aut0Exec> sux
[13:00:25] <Aut0Exec> server is slow
[13:00:32] <haizum> ryanneufeld, its returning the full URL of the link
[13:00:42] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i'm just going to use the ScrollTo now since i did get the smooth scrolling and continue playing.. ultimately. like i said, i will use tried and true plugins
[13:00:51] <haizum> i set up an alert on the click event
[13:00:54] <pifantastic> Aut0Exec: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[13:00:57] <haizum> its live
[13:01:03] <haizum> alert(this);
[13:01:33] <ryanneufeld> haizum: don't aleryt
[13:01:37] <ryanneufeld> on a live site
[13:01:40] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, localScroll is pretty much the same thing as scrollTo, it just takes care of binding the scrollTo functions to your hash links
[13:01:43] <SP33D> pifantastic can you suggest me the right selector on $("body *").replaceText( /Base/gi, '<img src="http://jsfiddle.net/img/logo.png" />' ); this example i need to select exactly this parse: and i need to exactly Replace this parse with any html ^^
[13:02:01] <MistuhKurtz> You could do the same thing by using hashchange and binding the window's hashchange event to scrollTo
[13:02:08] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  so do you suggest localScroll or ScrollTo? I never really could get the difference
[13:02:09] <ryanneufeld> I asked for console.log specifically because it gives access to the inner properties of the object on the console. Alert is useless
[13:02:09] <haizum> ryanneufeld, fine i just did console.log(this);
[13:02:11] <SP33D> <a href="http://linuscom.de/index.php?cat=c14_Base-Base-14.html" class="boxlink aktiv_sub">Base</a>
[13:02:15] <SP33D> ehm sorry
[13:02:21] <haizum> sorry
[13:02:25] <MistuhKurtz> localScroll depends on scrollTo LindsayMac
[13:02:32] <ryanneufeld> haizum: k, gimme 3 mins to read the docs
[13:02:36] <SP33D> ">Base</a> i need to select and replace exactly that
[13:02:48] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i know that.. but i wasn't clear as to what it adds to it
[13:03:04] <haizum> ryanneufeld, sure thanks
[13:03:16] <pifantastic> SP33D: http://jsfiddle.net/Adpdq/6/
[13:03:31] <bricker88> mao
[13:03:33] <MistuhKurtz> localScroll just binds the scrollTo functions for hash links, LindsayMac
[13:03:33] <bricker88> oops
[13:03:34] <ryanneufeld> haizum: okay, I see what you've done here. You were correct to have 'category' instead of sortName
[13:03:53] <ryanneufeld> haizum: the problem is, that you've only asked it to sort by data-category alphabetically
[13:03:59] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  ok get it
[13:04:33] <ryanneufeld> haizum: what you want is filtering http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/filtering.html
[13:05:03] <SP33D> :(
[13:05:03] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  do you know what serialScroll dow?
[13:05:05] <LindsayMac> does*
[13:05:12] <SP33D> why don't you get me i know your a good guy
[13:05:19] <SP33D> but you think and change my question
[13:05:27] <SP33D> i know how to select the named class
[13:05:31] <SP33D> :(
[13:05:38] <SP33D> i need a more variable solution
[13:05:54] <SP33D> :(
[13:05:58] <MistuhKurtz> it's like a carousel LindsayMac
[13:06:09] <pifantastic> SP33D: can you please edit my jsfiddle and include the actual HTML you are trying to do this with?
[13:06:27] <SP33D> you got the right html
[13:06:33] <SP33D> but your using the class as selector
[13:06:37] <SP33D> i need to look for the code
[13:06:44] <SP33D> coz i wanna use it at other places too
[13:07:00] <SP33D> i need a code to change every simply every hyperlink that contains base
[13:07:01] <pifantastic> SP33D: so it won't just be <a> tags, but any kind of tag?
[13:07:10] <SP33D> only a tags
[13:07:20] <pifantastic> SP33D: http://jsfiddle.net/Adpdq/7/
[13:07:24] <SP33D> but not all are in the same class
[13:07:26] <ryanneufeld> haizum: $container.isotope({ filter: '[data-category="Editorial"]'});
[13:07:27] <pifantastic> SP33D: what's the problem with that?
[13:07:32] <ryanneufeld> that is one way to make it work
[13:07:57] <SP33D> Could work
[13:07:59] <SP33D> ill try thx
[13:08:17] <ajpiano> SP33D: you can't treat HTML like a string of characters once it's in the DOM, you have to create a new node and put it in the other node, you can't just select ">Base</a>, you can only work with the anchor or the text inside of it, etc.
[13:08:36] <ryanneufeld> haizum: see if this works http://pastebin.com/SPhYHrZ8
[13:08:52] <ryanneufeld> haizum: it's not the *best* solution, but it works.
[13:09:05] <haizum> k
[13:09:07] <haizum> testing
[13:10:56] <haizum> ryanneufeld, seems to work. you da man :)
[13:11:20] <ryanneufeld> haizum: yeah, I would recommend you use classes instead of the data-category though
[13:11:21] <haizum> ryanneufeld, i'm confused as to why it wasn't working the way i had it
[13:11:37] <haizum> i can do classes too
[13:11:45] <ryanneufeld> haizum: what you wanted was to filter and only show the given category
[13:11:54] <haizum> nod
[13:12:01] <ryanneufeld> haizum: what you were doing was telling isotope to sort by category
[13:12:22] <ryanneufeld> haizum: so it was always sorting by the category alphabetically
[13:12:24] <haizum> well, i'd prefer to have it sort rather than filter
[13:12:43] <haizum> sort by category
[13:12:55] <haizum> it wasn't working
[13:13:07] <ryanneufeld> haizum: the trouble with it though, is how does the user know which is which?
[13:13:26] <haizum> true
[13:13:50] <ryanneufeld> haizum: if you are dead set on it, then you would need a data attr for each category on every item
[13:13:59] <ryanneufeld> that would have say a sort order
[13:14:11] <haizum> ryanneufeld, isn't that what i had
[13:14:19] <ryanneufeld> no, you had only one category
[13:14:31] <ryanneufeld> I'm saying you need a sort value for every category, on every item
[13:14:46] <ryanneufeld> that's just my initial idea
[13:15:18] <haizum> ryanneufeld, any idea why my about and contact buttons are broken now
[13:15:31] * ryanneufeld looks
[13:15:33] <haizum> they're trying to act as filters
[13:15:46] <ryanneufeld> haizum: yeah, you've bound on click to all of them
[13:15:51] <haizum> right..
[13:15:52] <ryanneufeld> and you're returning false
[13:16:14] <ryanneufeld> can you add a class just to the items that you want to be filter links?
[13:16:27] <ryanneufeld> if so, the you can use that selector instead of the one you have to bind to click action on
[13:17:52] <LSshock> hi everyone, i have a date type of variable that is formatted as "2011-22" thats year+weeknumber and i was wondering if there was a way of making sure that the variable (which is received by input is always 0000-00 format
[13:18:08] <bricker88> Hello. I'm having trouble with the stop() function. It's not working as expected - the animation simply doesn't stop. I'm using it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7gCP3/
[13:18:09] <LSshock> so do a check somehow to make sure the variable form input is a valid date type
[13:18:30] <ryanneufeld> haizum: does that make sense?
[13:18:55] <haizum> ryanneufeld, no
[13:19:08] <ryanneufeld> okay, what doesn't make sense?
[13:19:48] <haizum> its complicated because the html for the custom wordpress menu is automatically created and injected
[13:20:21] <LindsayMac> did someone say wordpress?
[13:20:23] <LindsayMac> I CAN HELP!
[13:20:32] <haizum> all i can change is the url and the label
[13:20:36] <haizum> for the menu items
[13:20:37] <LindsayMac> haizum:  you can change anything about wordpress you want
[13:21:00] <LindsayMac> you can even add unique classes to the <li> or even to the <a> links if you wanted
[13:21:15] <LindsayMac> haizum:  what are you trying to do?
[13:21:15] <haizum> ryanneufeld, i think the easiest solution would be to alter the click event to only affect the category buttons
[13:21:32] <ryanneufeld> haizum: if LindsayMac says she can help, see what she can do to help. She is right, you *can* change anything you want about WP
[13:21:37] <LindsayMac> if it will simplify the js by adding a unqiue ID or class, let me know.. i can help
[13:21:54] <LindsayMac> i may not be able to do js well.. but i KNOW wordpress inside and out
[13:22:04] <ryanneufeld> haizum: to do that you'd need to add a class to them, or you'd have to update the code every single time you changed the categories
[13:22:05] * LindsayMac is not a complete tard 
[13:22:22] <haizum> k
[13:22:28] <LindsayMac> Just tell me what you are trying to do.. ultimately.
[13:22:29] <LindsayMac> please
[13:22:31] <ryanneufeld> haizum LindsayMac can you guys chat and see what you need?
[13:22:32] <LindsayMac> let me feel useful!
[13:23:00] <LindsayMac> ?
[13:23:02] <haizum> $('#menu-main-menu a') needs to be changed so that it only affects the menu items with a certain class
[13:23:10] <aleminio> Hey guys, using js/jquery, how can i check while the page is loading, what percentage of the entire document has been loaded?
[13:23:24] <LindsayMac> no go backwards more... haizum .. what class are you trying to add to your menu that would make things easier?
[13:23:41] <LindsayMac> and to which element.. the <li> or the <a>
[13:24:13] <haizum> a class name for the isotope buttons
[13:24:19] <LindsayMac> haizum:  are you saying that you want a unique class for each <a> in the menu or can you select it form the <li> ?
[13:24:23] <haizum> the last 2 being regular links that i don't want affected by isotope
[13:24:28] <LindsayMac> haizum:  i HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ISOTOPE BUTTONS ARE
[13:24:42] <haizum> they're just links with a unique hash
[13:24:43] <LindsayMac> i am coming in in the middle here... so you have to start over
[13:25:16] <LindsayMac> haizum:  so you basically need a unique class for each <a> link so that you can put in your javascript those links so that the function ONLY tryiggers on the one you want.. right?
[13:25:30] <pifantastic> aleminio: even if that's possible, what good will it do you as you can't display anything to the user until the DOM has loaded.
[13:25:39] <haizum> yes
[13:25:58] <haizum> is there a plugin that allows me to add classes to each menu item
[13:26:09] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: isotope is a library, he's using the links to tell it to sort/filter things. He needs a class for some menu items, but not all
[13:26:11] <LindsayMac> haizum:  does it HAVE to be a class on the <a> or can it be a class on the <li> <a> so like .liclass a
[13:26:30] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: he just needs to select certain menu items
[13:26:31] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  thanks.. that makes sense... but can he use <li> classes as selectors? or just <a?
[13:26:43] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  so we can do this with <li> classes then.. thats easy pease
[13:26:44] <LindsayMac> y
[13:26:49] <haizum> ya
[13:27:07] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: http://www.richardbernardin.com/portfolio/ that's the site
[13:27:15] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: inspect the markup, you'll know
[13:27:30] <haizum> $('#menu-main-menu a').click(function(){
[13:27:33] <e-anima> i am getting the clicked element like this $("body").click(function (e) { var element = $(e.target);  problem is that i do not want a clik. i want to get the last focused element i was in when running the script
[13:27:38] <LindsayMac> haizum:  are you using dynamic menus using the appearance -> menus ?
[13:27:41] <e-anima> any ideas how to get the last focused element?
[13:27:44] <haizum> yes
[13:27:46] <LindsayMac> haizum:  this has nothing to do with JS yet
[13:28:00] <brettfrable> Hey guys. My code can be found here. http://pastie.org/4326156 - my problem is I'm loading content in a pager via ajax. When you click next and or a number the current content hides - then shows - THEN shows the new content
[13:28:01] <haizum> well it kind of does because that click event is the issue
[13:28:04] <LindsayMac> haizum:  when you add a new menu item , there is a box that says CLASS.. put your unique class in there
[13:28:08] <haizum> its bound to all the menu items
[13:28:08] <brettfrable> I need the content to just hide - then show new
[13:28:12] <LindsayMac> haizum:  this doesnt right now
[13:28:13] <brettfrable> you can see an example here.
[13:28:20] <brettfrable> http://candg.rswebworks.com/index.php?cID=117&q=&sortBy=0&sortOrder=ASC&ccm_paging_p=1#/index.php?cID=117&q=&sortBy=0&sortOrder=ASC&ccm_pagin
[13:28:29] <pifantastic> e-anima: there is a focus event
[13:28:30] <ryanneufeld> haizum: when you create the menu items, how is it done?
[13:28:32] <haizum> i dont have a CLASS box
[13:28:59] <LindsayMac> haizum:  hold on. screen shot comign
[13:29:11] <haizum> i'm adding a custom link which allows me to add url, label, and title attribute
[13:29:12] <shoky> brettfrable: $('#lawyers').load(toLoad,'',showNewContent())
[13:29:13] <haizum> thats it
[13:29:30] <shoky> brettfrable: that is calling showNewContent instead of passing a reference to it. remove the () parens
[13:29:30] <brettfrable> shaky - what can I do differently there
[13:29:38] <ryanneufeld> haizum: can you post a screen shot of the UI you're using?
[13:29:45] <LindsayMac> haizum:  this is present on EVERY SINGLE WORDPRESS INSTALL http://cl.ly/image/1l0M3S063Z1I
[13:29:51] <shoky> brettfrable: same with $('#lawyers').show('slow',hideLoader());
[13:29:51] <e-anima> "The focus event is sent to an element when it gains focus." i am not focustin around. i run the script and want to get the last focused element
[13:30:08] <shoky> brettfrable: you did it right for $('#lawyers').hide("slow",loadContent);
[13:30:35] <haizum> argh, it was a screen option
[13:30:36] <haizum> i had to check
[13:30:37] <haizum> doh
[13:30:43] <pifantastic> e-anima: You're going to have to use the focus event to keep track of which element is in focus, so that when the time comes, you'll know it
[13:31:16] <LindsayMac> haizum:  dern..i  didnt get to show my wordpress coding skills
[13:31:17] <brettfrable> perfect
[13:31:19] <e-anima> problem is i am doing this o na bookmarklet so the code is not run during mouse movement, only if i hit the button
[13:31:21] <brettfrable> thanks
[13:31:24] <LindsayMac> I was hoping you needed a walker class and that would have been more fun
[13:31:41] <LindsayMac> its easy to add a unique class to a <li> but near impossible pain in the butt to do so to the <a)
[13:32:19] <pifantastic> e-anima: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[13:32:24] <pifantastic> you can get the currently focused element
[13:32:30] <haizum> fixed!
[13:32:34] <pifantastic> via  $( document.activeElement )
[13:32:37] <haizum> LindsayMac, :)
[13:32:43] <e-anima> ah nice, thx pifantastic
[13:32:43] * LindsayMac is the genius.. and no code needed 
[13:32:44] <LindsayMac> lol
[13:33:01] <haizum> ryanneufeld, take a look now its working
[13:33:10] <haizum> added a class "isotope" to only the isotope buttons
[13:33:15] <haizum> then changed this line to:
[13:33:16] <haizum> $('#menu-main-menu .isotope a').click(function(){
[13:33:18] <haizum> :))
[13:33:44] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: you still there?
[13:34:33] <ajpiano> nope
[13:34:56] <ryanneufeld> haizum: nice
[13:35:09] <haizum> ryanneufeld, this has however created yet another issue... now that once you're on about or contact pages, the isotope buttons have no functionality anymore obviously
[13:35:11] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  theres a built in class field in the wordpress menu manager
[13:35:12] <haizum> :/
[13:35:17] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: lol cant get that one liner you gave me to work
[13:35:31] <Aut0Exec> ajpiano: i have ... $("#extr").load('{% url records.views.test %}', function() { $(this).dialog(); });
[13:35:32] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: Yeah, I know, sometimes seeing what they see can help
[13:35:42] <ryanneufeld> haizum: yeah, that is a bit of an issue.
[13:35:48] <haizum> lol
[13:35:54] <ryanneufeld> have fun with that :p
[13:35:57] <haizum> i'll just have to make those buttons not leave the home.php
[13:36:09] <ryanneufeld> my lunch break is over, I gotta get back to work :p
[13:36:10] <haizum> that's a design problem though really
[13:36:13] <haizum> can fix that easily enough
[13:36:24] <ryanneufeld> also, you need to account for 'empty' categories
[13:36:29] <LindsayMac> haizum:  you can use if is_frontpage
[13:36:40] <LindsayMac> to only display buttons on the home page
[13:36:46] <ryanneufeld> see, LindsayMac's got your back
[13:37:02] <ryanneufeld> haizum: That is a nice looking site though
[13:37:09] <LindsayMac> lots of fun conditionals in wordpress...
[13:37:24] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: LOTS of global functions
[13:37:31] <haizum> ryanneufeld, thanks it's getting there :)
[13:37:41] <LindsayMac> thats why I love wordpress
[13:37:54] <haizum> LindsayMac, can you give me an example im not sure i understand
[13:38:05] <deflux-> Greetings.  Question.  If my document load handler is called, is there any way for me to stop any other load handlers from executing?
[13:38:09] <LindsayMac> haizum:  sure.
[13:38:24] <deflux-> Apaprently callbacks using the $(callback); style does not get an event object passed into it.
[13:38:38] <haizum> LindsayMac, are you on my page right now and understand the issue?
[13:39:00] <LindsayMac> haizum:  You just dont want the buttons to show hwne you aren't on the home page.. right?
[13:39:14] <LindsayMac> ugh.. my internet is acting up!
[13:39:18] <ryanneufeld> haizum: I think I'm gonna draw inspiration from this site for my own :p
[13:39:32] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  isotope is AWESOME.. my portfolio used it as well
[13:39:43] <haizum> LindsayMac, not exactly.. i'd rather the buttons were static
[13:39:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah, have you looked at the licensing for it?
[13:39:50] <haizum> isotope owns
[13:39:58] <LindsayMac> haizum:  not sure what you mean static?
[13:40:05] <LindsayMac> gimme a link again to your site?
[13:40:15] <haizum> ryanneufeld, take a look at my music blog http://riddlepark.fm/ its using masonry (the old isotope) but similar design
[13:40:34] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: he wants them to sort when on the front page, and link back to the front page (sorted I assume) when clicked from not the front page
[13:40:42] <haizum> exactly.
[13:40:52] <LindsayMac> herm...
[13:41:04] <LindsayMac> i dont think that a php conditional is what you want them...
[13:41:06] <ryanneufeld> :) I'm used to decoding requirements :P
[13:43:05] <haizum> this might require me to ditch the whole custom menu system altogether
[13:43:17] <haizum> and make my own so that i can use php
[13:43:27] <haizum> with an if/then
[13:43:36] <haizum> detecting whether or not its the home page
[13:43:50] <haizum> and create the html links based on that
[13:44:09] <haizum> sigh..
[13:44:27] <LindsayMac> haizum:  theres no different
[13:44:35] <haizum> ?
[13:44:39] <LindsayMac> tou can use the menu and wrap it in an if is_front_page()
[13:44:48] <LindsayMac> i just dont know how to wrap the JS so it functions differently.
[13:44:51] <LindsayMac> because im a php gal
[13:45:05] <Know1edge1> hey guys, whats the best way to JSON.parse a jsonp response
[13:45:17] <Know1edge1> an api im calling is returning json wrapped in parenthesis
[13:45:42] <haizum> LindsayMac, i can probably figure out the js part if you can show me how to wrap the menu in php
[13:46:49] <tw2113> php isn't like a div you wrap around markup
[13:46:54] <juha_> b-ot: tell coldhead there's three more versions of drinking game
[13:47:04] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  it isnt?
[13:47:05] <juha_> b-ot: fuck you!
[13:47:06] <b-ot> juha_, I‚Äôll tell coldhead about that.
[13:47:09] <juha_> thanks
[13:47:25] <tw2113> html = client side, php = server side
[13:47:33] <LindsayMac> lol tw2113 i was messing with you
[13:47:44] <e-anima> how would you debug a bookmarklet? problem is that its not a file so i can not setp in with the crom debgger.
[13:47:50] <tw2113> i missed seeing the sarcasm tag
[13:47:56] <LindsayMac> sarcmark
[13:48:05] <pifantastic> e-anima: use it as a file while you're debuggng
[13:48:20] <pifantastic> e-anima: and when it works, then turn it into a bookmarklet
[13:48:38] <LindsayMac> haizum: <?php if (is_front_page()) { your code here } ?>
[13:48:41] <e-anima> hm
[13:49:05] <haizum> LindsayMac, yes but where do i put that so that it wraps the menu div only
[13:49:10] <haizum> in home.php
[13:49:14] <e-anima> you mena somehow linking it as a file
[13:49:26] <LindsayMac> haizum:  you put the code for your menu inside  { }
[13:49:42] <LindsayMac> you dont move it.. keep your menu code wher eit is and wrap it.. that will say if is home do this.. otherwise do that ...
[13:50:16] <haizum> but the menu code is created by wordpress
[13:51:10] <LindsayMac> haizum:  the "interior" code is.. but you should have code to call for the menuy
[13:51:13] <LindsayMac> its not magic
[13:51:24] <hlveheart> shoky is magical
[13:51:54] <LindsayMac> haizum:  there should be SOMETHING SOMEWHERE in your theme that says     wp_nav_menu( array( 'container_class' => 'menu-header', 'theme_location' => 'primary' ) ); ?>
[13:52:28] <shoky> ©∫∞®®∞∫©©∫∞®®∞∫© no i'm not ©∫∞®®∞∫©©∫∞®®∞∫©
[13:52:41] <hlveheart> lol
[13:52:53] <hlveheart> how's life, you wizard, you.
[13:53:06] <shoky> okz. work is da bore
[13:53:10] <shoky> U?
[13:53:54] <haizum> LindsayMac, right now i have in my settings -> reading to have my front page display my latest posts
[13:54:11] <haizum> LindsayMac, my home.php has nothing about a menu in it
[13:54:15] <LindsayMac> ok then you can use is_home instead of front_page haizum
[13:54:21] <LindsayMac> haizum:  it may be in header.php
[13:54:25] <haizum> ahh
[13:54:27] <LindsayMac> or index.php
[13:54:34] <LindsayMac> it really could be anywhere depending on how your theme is
[13:55:31] <haizum> LindsayMac, found it
[13:55:35] <haizum> in header
[13:55:37] <haizum> <?php wp_nav_menu(array('menu' => 'main_menu')); ?>
[13:56:06] <LindsayMac> haizum:  that is what you wrap in your conditional
[13:56:21] <LindsayMac> if your home is set to recentl posts, use is_home if its a static you use is_front_page
[13:56:43] <haizum> k
[13:56:47] <SuperrMann> Is there a native application that you can run javascript code and test?
[13:56:49] <LindsayMac> "home" is always going to be your blog's home page.. so if you used that , even though your front page is a static page, its going to work on the blog's main chronologically listed posts
[13:58:37] <sunbeam> how can i make it possible that only ONE of the TWO input checkboxes can be selected? (yes or not) - yes i know i should use radio buttons for that
[13:59:01] <LindsayMac> sunbeam:  you always have the most backwards questions.
[14:00:06] <haizum> so im just going to try to make my menu links appear as regular links to the home page, and then execute the isotope js after the window loads
[14:00:15] <haizum> to filter
[14:00:23] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: how might you think?
[14:01:37] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: how do you mean?
[14:02:01] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: let's talk through how to accomplish what you want.  what might be the first step?
[14:02:39] <sunbeam> i really don't know in this case
[14:02:41] <tw2113> check if any checkboxes are :checked and if true, disable the rest
[14:02:41] <LindsayMac> haizum:  that sounds right
[14:03:05] <NoiseEee> tw2113: SPOILER ALERT
[14:03:13] <tw2113> .on('checked') ?
[14:03:33] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: if you can't break things down into steps, how will you get anything done / learned?
[14:03:49] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: seriously, what might be one of the first things you need to do
[14:04:35] <sunbeam> check which is checked?
[14:04:39] <sunbeam> listen if any is checked?
[14:05:38] * tw2113 wonders how much "input, process, output" is emphasized in frontend development these days
[14:06:06] <NoiseEee> right, you might want to listen to the 'click' event of any checkboxes you are watching.
[14:06:09] <tw2113> or if that's more an application programming mentality
[14:06:18] <NoiseEee> and then figure out if the item clicked is now in a checked or unchecked state
[14:06:24] <NoiseEee> after that what might one do?
[14:06:32] <sunbeam> disable all the others
[14:06:39] <sunbeam> and just check the one clicked
[14:06:53] <sunbeam> i just didnt know about :checked
[14:06:57] <tw2113> just a thought, on re-clicking to uncheck, re-enable all the rest
[14:06:58] <sunbeam> and how that would work in code
[14:07:11] <sunbeam> tw2113: why enable all the rest?
[14:09:07] <haizum> LindsayMac, http://pastebin.com/em4ctvei
[14:09:07] <Kronuz> hello
[14:09:09] <haizum> does that look good to you?
[14:09:15] <haizum> im going to create a separate custom menu
[14:09:33] <Kronuz> hey, for ajax‚Ä¶ what's the difference between using done()/fail() vs using success/error options?
[14:10:05] <k1ng_> why i am getting TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_on' on jquery 1.7.2?
[14:10:30] <tw2113> well, once you uncheck the original, you want them to be able to change which one they want, right?
[14:10:31] <tw2113> and what if they choose the wrong one at first, or change their mind?
[14:10:32] <tw2113> don't want them having to refresh the whole page, or just sit there confused
[14:10:54] <LindsayMac> haizum:  thats what I would do
[14:10:59] <haizum> cool :)
[14:11:04] <LindsayMac> yep.. looks good
[14:12:40] <thin> is there a .scrollTo method?
[14:13:05] <thin> i want to scroll the page so that the top of the content area is at the top of the window, not the very top of my site
[14:15:33] <tw2113> isn't there a way to set what is scrolled to with the scrollTo plugin?
[14:15:35] <haizum> LindsayMac, how do i find the name of the menu in the array
[14:15:47] <LindsayMac> haizum:  what do you mean?
[14:15:56] <haizum> well i have to specify which menu
[14:16:07] <haizum> <?php wp_nav_menu(array('menu' => 'sub_menu')); ?>
[14:16:52] <foobarram001> Hi Guys, I was wondering how I can invoke two jquery elements in the same html page? I am new to jquery, and I have the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/829/ but the "stars" here wouldnt work, presumably because of the carousel element in front.. I was wondering how I could make both these elements work. Sorry if this is a dumb question
[14:16:56] <LindsayMac> haizum:  $menu accepts matching ID, slug, or name
[14:17:12] <haizum> k
[14:18:50] <zg> if my HTML is something like this: <div class="colors"><div class="red"></div><div class="blue"></div><div class="green"></div></div>
[14:18:58] <zg> how do I go from .green to .blue
[14:19:13] <zg> though it doesn't exist, something like this: $('.green').previous()
[14:19:18] <ajpiano> ?prev
[14:19:21] <shoky> zg: .prev()
[14:19:23] <ajpiano> zg it's .prev()
[14:19:28] <zg> haha
[14:19:53] <zg> .previous should map to .prev ..........
[14:19:57] <zg> but, meh
[14:20:01] <zg> thanks!!
[14:20:12] <shoky> that would add worthless bytes
[14:20:30] <shoky> for making a name longer than it is.
[14:20:49] <hlveheart> shoky you there?
[14:20:58] <shoky> am here
[14:21:28] <shoky> you?
[14:21:57] <b1lly> lets say I put 2 events within a bind
[14:22:02] <b1lly> is there a way to know which one was triggered?
[14:23:21] <haizum> LindsayMac, ok got that working.. now the trick is to have some js execute after the next page loads after a link is clicked... any thoughts?
[14:23:41] <LindsayMac> haizum:  i am NOT a js genius.. that is the language i am just learning
[14:23:51] <haizum> ok
[14:24:03] <haizum> well the code itself will be identical to the code i already have on home.php (the click event)
[14:24:08] * tw2113 heard a rumor that LindsayMac is a pro at giving elements an ID
[14:24:19] <haizum> its just that i need that code to run on like a document.onload or something
[14:24:33] <haizum> based on which link i click
[14:24:37] <haizum> rather than bound to all of them
[14:24:41] <haizum> hmm
[14:30:58] <k1ng_> why i am getting TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_on' on jquery 1.7.2?
[14:31:02] <k1ng_> on a plugin
[14:40:01] <juha_> _on?
[14:40:33] <juha_> k1ng_: please provide code example, jsfiddle etc
[14:40:51] <shoky> drinks, food
[14:40:55] <k1ng_> juha_, i am trying to use jqueryui tooltips
[14:41:29] <shoky> k1ng_ jquery ui 1.9 beta?
[14:41:39] <fission6> whats a good design pattern for the following, i have a table, where i am binding click to 'td' elements, i want to toggle between two states, "yes" and "no"
[14:42:06] <k1ng_> no 1.8.22
[14:42:35] <shoky> k1ng_ 1.8 doesn't have tooltips tho
[14:42:51] <juha_> is there a method _on in jquery/jquery ui?
[14:42:54] <foobarram001> Can someone please tell me what is (all) wrong with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/838/ I ve been struck for the past couple of hours on this :(
[14:43:05] <juha_> k1ng_: maybe you have a typo and it should be "on", not "_on"
[14:43:24] <shoky> no reason for it not to be _on if it's inside a jqui widget
[14:43:46] <foobarram001> basically, the "stars ratings" does not work when the "carousel javascript" is on..
[14:43:54] <k1ng_> juha_, i have tried to change to _on
[14:43:59] <juha_> shoky: ok so there is an _on method?
[14:44:00] <k1ng_> on*
[14:44:03] <k1ng_> it didnt work
[14:44:17] <k1ng_> in plugins, maybe i dont know
[14:44:22] <shoky> juha_ i donno, i thought he was saying a plugin was calling it
[14:44:28] <shoky> but now im not sure bout that
[14:45:01] <fission6> i guess osmething like this works var newText = $(this).html() == 'Yes' ? 'No' : 'Yes';
[14:46:14] <tw2113> foobarram001 TypeError: $("span.stars").stars is not a function
[14:46:43] <tw2113> when you have the carousel() stuff in it
[14:48:16] <shoky> fission6: proper fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/841/
[14:48:23] <tw2113> you also have excessive <script> blocks
[14:48:35] <foobarram001> oh
[14:48:44] <tw2113> foobarram001 keep the chat in here, not PM
[14:49:00] <shoky> oops i meant foobarram001
[14:49:02] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/tw2113/D2RLR/842/ <----cleaned up a bit
[14:49:13] <cseasy> hello jQuery fans, I'm wondering if someone can help me with a little dilemma‚Ä¶
[14:49:13] <tw2113> now it just gives me carousel is not a function errors
[14:49:20] <cseasy> I have made this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BzwxS
[14:49:22] <shoky> tw2113 check my fiddle
[14:49:51] <tw2113> shoky wins
[14:49:55] <cseasy> my problem is around line 55 of the JS, I am trying to set an interval for each of the two elements I created, but looking at the console, only the last one created get's the updates
[14:51:00] <cseasy> both timers are firing, but the referenced element in both is the last one created
[14:51:15] <cseasy> vs. the one I'd expect on each iteration through the loop
[14:51:36] <foobarram001> yea tw2113.. the problem is I have both carousel and the stars function.. and in your fiddle the stars dont work either.. but when I remove the carousel (as in: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/845/) the stars work
[14:51:55] <tw2113> foobarram001 look at shoky's
[14:52:01] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/841/
[14:52:37] <tw2113> i got mine to work with both, but he beat me to it
[14:52:43] <foobarram001> ah.. just looked at it... :)
[14:53:37] <foobarram001> May I ask what is this 841 fiddle is different to what I had before? I am trying to learn here.. So, in the 841 fiddle, do I club at the JS under <script></script>?
[14:54:18] <foobarram001> I meant *how is this 841 fiddle....
[14:54:55] <tw2113> shoky?
[14:55:42] <fission6> is there a way to make a map into a json string
[14:57:56] <shoky> cseasy: you want to have local scope (function scope) inside your loop. otherwise the vars you declare inside the loop are not really local
[14:57:57] <jsnoob> is there a method i can call to check if a variable contains a jquery object
[14:58:13] <shoky> cseasy: is this better?  http://jsfiddle.net/BzwxS/1/
[14:59:06] <Einzig> hey all. Total beginners question: I found this part of example code   $("select option:selected").each(function () , how can I make it work without "each"?
[14:59:27] <cseasy> shoky: that looks good, going to compare them now to see what you did
[14:59:45] <cseasy> shoky: what you say makes sense coneptually, now I just need to understand the code
[14:59:45] <foobarram001> Hi shoky.. how do I implement your fiddle 841 in html? should all the javascript go in within the <script></script> tag?
[14:59:56] <cseasy> shoky: I appreciate your help, thank you
[15:00:00] <shoky> cseasy np
[15:02:58] <evandrof> anyone could help me with a problem...
[15:02:59] <evandrof> ?
[15:03:07] <Einzig> Trying to make this work : http://jsbin.com/aqedot but the "each" function makes no sense and it outputs previously selected items.
[15:03:07] <cseasy> shoky: is it the .each(obj.data, function () { ‚Ä¶ }) that is doing the magic, each iteration through the loop is wrapped in a function that gives it that scope?
[15:03:48] <shoky> foobarram001: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/846/
[15:04:10] <evandrof> need to test a list of urls from client side, but cant read 404, 403...
[15:05:06] <shoky> cseasy: it's the function scope doing the magic, yes.  you could also have kept your loop and done:  while (len--) { (function(len) { .... })(len); }
[15:05:36] <cseasy> shoky: thanks for the explanation, again, appreciate your help. have a great day
[15:05:49] <shoky> you too
[15:07:01] <evandrof> anyone?
[15:07:09] <imachuchu> I have a problem with the jquery ui plugin and cloning, I was told to instead replace the clone with a templating system, what would be a good place to start looking/library to use?
[15:10:56] <shoky> Einzig: your .each keeps appending values to selected_text
[15:16:38] <Einzig> shoky: yes, I noticed. But I have no idea how to make it just for one at a time.
[15:17:03] <Einzig> As you can see , I try to insert automated values into the textbox. multiple values make no sense
[15:17:20] <Einzig> I have no idea about the normal syntax
[15:19:57] <Einzig> replacing with add fails, replacing with a dot fails
[15:20:34] <shoky> dont know what result you're looking for
[15:22:06] <Einzig> http://jsbin.com/aqedot I am trying to read the value of the option, then I do a switch statement to fill in dates in the two textboxes.
[15:23:26] <Dave_Stein> Anyone know if this would be a bug or feature? If user is zooming/unzooming in Chrome, and font-size is taken using .css('font-size') it can report the wrong number
[15:23:33] <Dave_Stein> I feel like it's a Chrome bug
[15:23:47] <Dave_Stein> setInterval( function() { console.log( $('#element').css('font-size') ); }, 500 ); gives funny results in Chrome but in FF the interval appears to stop as zoom-unzoom is going on
[15:24:13] <shoky> Einzig: but you keep appending to the same selected_text
[15:24:21] <shoky> Einzig: how is a switch gonna work on it??
[15:24:57] <Einzig> Can you help me fix that?
[15:25:23] <shoky> Einzig: http://jsbin.com/aqedot/3
[15:25:24] <Einzig> it was an example on jquery,com.
[15:26:24] <Tronic> It is possible to make a GET request with data inside the request and not on the URL?
[15:26:31] <Tronic> *Is it
[15:27:26] <Tronic> I am trying to implement a RESTful API where the request input data (in case it is complex) is not urlencoded but always a JSON object.
[15:27:40] <shoky> how is that RESTful?
[15:28:04] <Einzig> shoky: thanks!
[15:28:05] <shoky> GET is for getting, POST is for posting
[15:28:14] <Tronic> Because it uses GET to get a request. URL cannot be properly used to identify it.
[15:28:23] <Tronic> s/request/resource/
[15:29:47] <Tronic> I could use PUT or POST to get around the problem but those have wrong semantics (I am not storing anything).
[15:30:26] <Tronic> Also I could use urlencoded parameters but that gets very ugly.
[15:30:44] <Tronic> e.g. base64 encoded JSON
[15:32:56] <shoky> why not make it identifiable via the URL?
[15:32:56] <sunbeam> i'd like to reset all checkboxes, and only have the one thats currently clicked as checked, i use this code: http://pastebin.com/r2kfirb8
[15:33:01] <sunbeam> Any idea what I do wrong>
[15:33:01] <nessaja> Hello LindsayMac
[15:34:49] <Tronic> shoky: Because representing complex data (tree structures etc) on URL is inconvenient.
[15:35:10] <Tronic> JSON solves that problem properly.
[15:39:14] <shoky> Tronic: well then i'd use POST. seeing as GETting a resource based on complex data doesn't sound RESTful anyway
[15:39:20] <shoky> screw the semantics
[15:41:50] <shoky> but i may be wrong in my thinking
[15:43:20] <Tronic> shoky: Ok, seems like the best option. Fortunately this is all about AJAX requests so browser history behavior is not an issue.
[15:56:07] <bricker88> is event.stopPropagation() supposed to work with mouseenter/mouseleave events?
[15:59:45] <maslo> hi guys I was just wondering if anyone could hint me toward a plugin for animating the dropdown menu on this website http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/ (Hover services)
[16:11:06] <sunbeam> i'd like to reset all checkboxes, and only have the one thats currently clicked as checked, i use this code: http://pastebin.com/r2kfirb8
[16:11:10] <sunbeam> Any idea what I do wrong>
[16:12:02] <ajpiano> it sounds like you should use a radio button
[16:12:04] <ajpiano> :D
[16:12:39] <o12> I do a $.get request on a JSON feed I setup, and get an object returned.. but I don't know how to return the data so I can assign it elsewhere. Does anyone see what I need to do? http://pastebin.com/EYEu1VKf
[16:13:26] <o12> I can access the data that I want just fine in the first function. But the last two lines, where I try to assign the dict elements, don't work. I'm new to javascript..
[16:13:37] <ajpiano> o12:  welcome to javascript, in that case ;)
[16:13:48] <ajpiano> o12: in javascript many operations are asynchronous including ajax
[16:13:54] <sunbeam> ajpiano: seriously, how can i make this work?
[16:13:57] <ajpiano> you don't "return" the call
[16:14:25] <ajpiano> sunbeam: i'd do something like this http://pastebin.com/MUdwS3LS
[16:14:27] <maslo> hi guys I asked earlier but no one seemed to be there so I'll repeat once more :O can anyone hint me on how to animate the dropdown menu (hovering services) on this websites http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/, the dropdown is in http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/wp-content/themes/aem/js/function.js, would be appreciated thanks
[16:14:39] <sunbeam> .not() ?
[16:14:45] <sunbeam> didnt know about that function even
[16:14:46] <sunbeam> thnx
[16:14:46] <ajpiano> o12: what you have to do is use the callback and perform the next step of processing in the callback
[16:15:46] <o12> ajpiano: Thanks. So,... at the end of my get, I chain a .success() with my return?
[16:16:02] <sunbeam> ajpiano: that doesn't work
[16:16:11] <ajpiano> o12: you either provide a success: function() {} or attach a .done() to the $.ajax
[16:16:30] <sunbeam> i mean, does simply not uncheck everything
[16:16:32] <ajpiano> sunbeam: can you make a fiddle or jsbin please
[16:16:35] <o12> hmm ok
[16:16:59] <ajpiano> o12: besides javascript, are you new to programming in gerneral?
[16:18:17] <o12> Just Python and SQL
[16:18:17] <sunbeam> ajpiano: sec
[16:18:29] <ajpiano> o12: ok...
[16:18:59] <ajpiano> o12: if you read about Continuation Passing and Deferreds
[16:19:10] <ajpiano> you will get a better sense of genreally how flow control works in js
[16:19:17] <ajpiano> and then ajax is just a subset of htat
[16:19:34] <ajpiano> http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/cps/
[16:19:50] <o12> Great, thank you
[16:20:06] <ajpiano> $.ajax in jQuery is an implementation of Deferreds
[16:20:23] <o12> Ok
[16:20:46] <sunbeam> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/u954k/
[16:23:00] <ajpiano> lol it works with attr
[16:23:25] <ajpiano> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/u954k/3/
[16:25:46] <sunbeam> ajpiano: ok great
[16:25:50] <sunbeam> i know why it doesn't work
[16:26:03] <sunbeam> I use uniformjs to alter the default input checkboxes
[16:26:09] <ajpiano> ah
[16:26:33] <ajpiano> presumably there's a method to refresh the fancy ones based on the state of the actual ones
[16:26:34] <ajpiano> ... maybe
[16:26:35] <ajpiano> :p
[16:26:49] <sunbeam> any idea how i can find this?
[16:27:13] <ajpiano> sunbeam: just to be clear you're basically asking me to go read the documentation of a project i've never used or looked at
[16:27:17] <ajpiano> and tell you what it says
[16:27:33] <ajpiano> cause i'm just like, guessing that that would be the case :p
[16:28:34] <sunbeam> ahh ok
[16:28:41] <ajpiano> sunbeam: but yep
[16:28:55] <ajpiano> it's right here http://uniformjs.com/#docs
[16:29:00] <ajpiano> $.uniform.update
[16:30:29] <sunbeam> ah thanks
[16:31:00] <sunbeam> $.uniform.update("#myUpdatedCheckbox");
[16:31:07] <sunbeam> so this i should make a function?
[16:32:50] <ajpiano> i assume that $.uniform.update("input[type='checkbox']") inside of the handler
[16:32:51] <ajpiano> would work
[16:38:02] <sunbeam> $.uniform.update(this).removeAttr("checked"); you mean
[16:38:33] <ajpiano> omg no
[16:38:41] <ajpiano> they're separate things
[16:38:45] <ajpiano> first you remove the attr
[16:38:51] <ajpiano> then you call uniform's update method
[16:38:58] <ajpiano> which fixes the states
[16:39:34] <sunbeam> but you need at set any attr to checked, right?
[16:40:55] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/u954k/4/
[16:42:21] <sunbeam> ah works, but:
[16:42:55] <sunbeam> nevermind
[16:43:02] <sunbeam> just didnt understand this syntax
[16:43:08] <sunbeam> var selector = "input[type='checkbox']",
[16:43:21] <sunbeam> didnt know you could use a comma after a value
[16:43:32] <o12> ajpiano: Really I am trying to request data and then graph it. Should I be doing $.get, then .success with a call to a function that actually renders the graph?
[16:44:17] <ajpiano> o12:  yep ;)
[16:44:37] <o12> Ok thanks
[16:48:31] <sunbeam> ajpiano: what would be the best way to complete remove a div with #something
[17:18:29] <azbyin> hi all..
[17:19:21] <azbyin> coldhead, you around? remember the click() not triggering the handler (and also not changing state) for a site i was working with?
[17:20:28] <azbyin> i made a local test with jquery 1.5.1  and .click() does exactly what it is supposed to do: triggers the event and also changes state!
[17:22:26] <coldhead> i don't understand, azbyin, does that mean everything is fine now and case closed?
[17:23:03] <azbyin> no! thats the problem
[17:23:22] <azbyin> i cannot get .click() to work on any of the buttons/checkboxes/radios!
[17:23:41] <coldhead> is there perhaps some other click() handler that's messing things up?
[17:23:59] <azbyin> it works on a local test page, but never on the live site. and firebug (also ff webconsole and chrome console) show absolutely no errors or warnings
[17:24:40] <azbyin> isn;t it possible to inspect a checkbox and find out what the onclick handler is for it?
[17:24:53] <azbyin> i'll try it to make sure it really is the right handler that is supposed to be called
[17:25:22] <coldhead> something like this http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[17:28:07] <azbyin> err.. what is this "drag visual event to your bookmark bar" ?
[17:28:15] <azbyin> i never have my bookmark bar visible
[17:28:45] <raj> coldhead, ever used socket.io?
[17:28:52] <azbyin> it obviously is not an addon. does ff simply run the js code in a "bookmark" if it is clicked?
[17:29:07] <coldhead> yes azbyin
[17:29:23] <coldhead> probably doesn't work with the newer jQuery event bindings
[17:29:25] <coldhead> but worth a shot
[17:29:31] <coldhead> raj: nope
[17:31:14] <raj> k
[17:32:47] <dlam> in general, are GET's faster than POST's?
[17:32:53] <dlam> i have no idea
[17:34:02] <azbyin> dlam, there shouldn't be any difference
[17:35:31] <systemfault> lool
[17:36:00] <shoky> but in general??
[17:36:02] <systemfault> Is an apple better than a garbage bag?
[17:36:27] <shoky> sup raj
[17:36:33] <raj> yo shoky!
[17:36:38] <systemfault> dlam: Their usage are different
[17:37:10] <o12> Can you call multiple $(document).ready() ?
[17:37:18] <systemfault> dlam: A GET request should never change the state on the server so multiple calls with the same parameter should return the same data (idempotent)
[17:37:40] <samholmes> Easiest way to swap two element's positions in the DOM?
[17:37:49] <systemfault> dlam: If you need to change the state (Let's say‚Ä¶ modify a user profile, you would use POST)
[17:38:10] <systemfault> dlam: There are more HTTP verbs but without XHR, only GET and POST are usable
[17:38:38] <raj> samholmes, $('#element1').switcheroo('#element2')
[17:38:57] <raj> *_* joke
[17:39:09] <samholmes> raj: actually..that works
[17:39:22] <raj> really! lemme try!
[17:39:28] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  In functions that repeat every X seconds, would it be worth it to have a global var of the jQuery selected elements being used; so the selector code is not run multiple times?  What would be the performance improvement in this method?
[17:39:30] <raj> wait a dog on second
[17:39:54] <samholmes> raj: gotcha. ;D
[17:40:30] <AcademyIntl> Basically, how permance intensive are jQuery selectors?
[17:40:33] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: it's a good idea to cache the selection
[17:40:42] <systemfault> AcademyIntl: If they don't change then sure, caching nodes is a great way to optimize performance
[17:40:44] <ajpiano> just to feel good about yourself
[17:40:55] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: but, there's no reason that variable has to be global
[17:41:12] <systemfault> AcademyIntl: Anything "touching" the DOM is slow, keep that in mind
[17:41:16] <AcademyIntl> ajpiano: Well, what do you mean about "Cache the sellector"
[17:41:23] <ajpiano> saving it into a variable
[17:41:28] <AcademyIntl> ajpiano: And as per global, I simply mean a "var" at the top of the script, right inside the .ready.
[17:41:31] <systemfault> var nodes = $(¬¥selector');
[17:41:33] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: that works
[17:41:34] <ajpiano> :)
[17:41:37] <azbyin> AcademyIntl, no need to even keep it global, simply pass it as a var to itself
[17:41:40] <AcademyIntl> systemfault: That's what I'm doing.
[17:41:47] <systemfault> AcademyIntl++
[17:41:57] <AcademyIntl> azbyin: Ehh... heh; you're funny.  Unfortunately that's not very easy given the code in question.
[17:42:05] <AcademyIntl> azbyin: Hence why it's just var for now.
[17:42:44] <AcademyIntl> also: Why can I not define functions that uase jQuery outside of the scope of .ready?  They don't function even though they are not erroring.. and the code in them isn't "ran" until they are called; yes?
[17:43:57] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: you can
[17:44:01] <ajpiano> what is stopping you from doing it
[17:44:17] <AcademyIntl> ajpiano: No idea, but the function content is BLANK when it's defined outside the ready according to firebug.  Very strange.
[17:44:44] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: i don't know what that means
[17:44:51] <raj> shoky, what happened to your op??
[17:45:04] <AcademyIntl> ajpiano: Uhm... I'd jsbin but it's a lot.  Moment while I make the project page publicly accessible.
[17:45:08] <o12> ajpiano: I got those graphs working. Thanks.
[17:45:13] <ajpiano> o12: awesome
[17:46:49] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: i can just ... prove that the opposite is true :p
[17:47:07] <AcademyIntl> ajpiano: It's probably something leaking outside of the ready, but I'm not sure if that is the case yet.
[17:47:24] <raj> ajpiano, how's it going?
[17:49:32] <ajpiano> AcademyIntl: http://jsbin.com/umokuh/edit
[17:49:38] <ajpiano> raj:  good :)
[17:50:15] <raj> nice, how's your baby [jqui]?
[17:50:25] <raj> the new one, that is
[17:50:35] <ajpiano> i didn't know jqui was my baby
[17:50:42] <raj> really? thought it was
[17:51:37] <ajpiano> i mean, if you are asking how jquery ui 1.9 is coming along :p
[17:51:48] <raj> yep
[17:51:54] <ajpiano> it's coming along :)
[17:56:42] <coldhead> lol ui
[17:57:54] <raj> que es tan comico?
[17:59:26] <o12> How can I do a default in a function, like render(topic, a = None, b = 1)?
[17:59:46] <ajpiano> in native js you can't
[17:59:53] <ajpiano> o12: the best you can do is
[18:00:11] <ajpiano> render(topic, a, b) { a = a || "None"; b = b || 1;
[18:00:17] <ajpiano> ... }
[18:00:33] <o12> Oh ok, thanks
[18:01:18] <raj> ajpiano, ever used socket.io?
[18:01:30] <ajpiano> a little
[18:02:08] <raj> is `var socket = io.connect('/chat');` a connected socket?
[18:02:18] <ajpiano> cmon dude
[18:02:50] <ajpiano> i haven't used it enough to remember off the top of my head
[18:02:58] <ajpiano> and i'm not gonna go read the docs for ya ;)
[18:03:01] <raj> oh ok
[18:03:09] <raj> well, afaict it is!
[18:03:15] <raj> but it's not letting me run the join method
[18:03:27] <raj> i dunno, guess I'll just wait till someone in #socket.io wakes up
[18:11:54] <Afflicto> Why is this not working? http://snpr.cm/WsL4O5.png
[18:24:48] <Whirl3d__> Good evening all. How do you effectively deal with this: Given a series of discreet container's whereby one container can be "active" at any given time and whereby these containers animate into and out of the "active" state, how do you keep from messing up when someone clicks three different buttons rapidly.
[18:26:15] <Whirl3d__> I keep finding that if someone clicks page 1, then page 3, then page 2 suddenly, more than one page is displayed or random things happen. I wondered how others manage this? Any advice?
[18:39:53] <coldhead> Whirl3d__: the "right" thing to do is have a single function that controls all the states and animations
[18:40:08] <coldhead> so it can mediate the inconsistencies
[18:40:17] <coldhead> rather than have each element look after its own state
[18:42:48] <Whirl3d__> coldhead, thanks for replying. I'm gonna strart from scratch (one more time) and when I get to the problem, I'll post a fiddle. I am managing the page states using one function and yet I am somehow getting weird results. Thanks for the advice, i'll post back if it happens again.
[18:55:10] <Whirl3d__> Is there an easy trick for determining if a value is scalar or not?
[18:57:20] <frewsxcv> Does anyone know a clean way to layout jQuery code that dynamically creates rather large HTML blocks?
[18:58:40] <ajpiano> frewsxcv: in an ideal world, you don't have the HTML block inside of javascript ;)
[18:58:55] <ajpiano> cause you're using client side templating lib instead of that
[18:59:01] <ajpiano> however if you must, there any number of solutions
[18:59:34] <ajpiano> you can write the html in an array, properly format/indent each line, and then call .join("") on it
[19:00:02] <frewsxcv> meh. next?
[19:00:29] <MistuhKurtz> what about mustache ajpiano, frewsxcv
[19:00:37] <ajpiano> wow
[19:01:28] <ajpiano> i assume that "properly format and indent each line but use str += '...' " is equally unpalatable
[19:01:28] <MistuhKurtz> or am I mistaken about what exactly mustache and other similar libraries/plugins do?
[19:01:33] <ajpiano> to your sensibilities?
[19:01:53] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz: mustache is a client side templating lib, which is what i said he'd be using in an ideal world
[19:02:06] <MistuhKurtz> I see
[19:02:43] <frewsxcv> ajpiano: Yeah, but I guess I'll do it
[19:03:00] <ajpiano> i mean, i think the array is less bulky looking
[19:03:13] <ajpiano> at least you don't have to write the var += on every single line...
[19:04:01] <frewsxcv> yeah, i chose the array
[19:04:03] <frewsxcv> thanks
[19:04:20] * frewsxcv wishes ECMAScript had something similar to Python's .format()
[19:05:18] <GingerSwede> someone with a huge ammount of patience and good knowledge of the jQuery validation plugin that could try and explain to me how I can add validation rules for elements via javascript naming them?
[19:06:15] <GingerSwede> Because I'm doing as the documentation tell me to... but, it's not picking it up :(.
[19:08:01] <MistuhKurtz> GingerSwede, see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[19:08:14] <MistuhKurtz> esp. the parts where you see rules: {\
[19:08:18] <MistuhKurtz> rule: {
[19:08:46] <GingerSwede> that's what I've been following :(. but I think I've misinterpitated some part of the information there :(
[19:09:02] <AcademyIntl> raj: Wait what, jQuery UI 1.9 ?
[19:13:06] <MistuhKurtz> GingerSwede, if you would like to set up a jsfiddle.net then either myself or someone else will be better able to help :)
[19:14:34] <GingerSwede> I think I just in the second hour of googling might have found something
[19:14:39] <GingerSwede> I'll get back to you ;)
[19:16:18] <GingerSwede> Solved it! :D.
[19:16:33] <AcademyIntl> Hi
[19:23:51] <wavez> I'm using jqGrid and I'm trying to figure out if I can add 4 new properties to each jqGrid that I put on my page. Meaning, I assume the each jqGrid is a javascript object, and I can give it new properties (variables) either before I made each grid, or after.
[19:26:49] <carpii> anyone available for a few hours jQuery / jQueryUI paid work ?
[19:27:31] <wavez> I'm tentative to respond yes to such an offer given in irc
[19:27:50] <wavez> I mean hesitant
[19:28:12] <carpii> trust me, im hesitant to ask :)
[19:28:21] <carpii> but whats your concern
[19:28:41] <wavez> how well is the work defined? What's the scope of the job? What's the pay?
[19:28:48] <carpii> http://carpii.homeip.net/hazel/ducky.zip
[19:28:49] <carpii> spec
[19:28:53] <carpii> pay negiotiable
[19:29:22] <carpii> ima software engineer myself, familiar with jQuery, just not got time to do it, and im not that familiar with drag/drop
[19:30:04] <coldhead> job offers in #jQuery are fine, it's just nice to drop a single link with all the details there-in
[19:30:19] <carpii> yeah sorry, kinda hard when someone asks a question tho
[19:30:36] <AcademyIntl> carpii: I have a comment feed / Q&A forum on the link :P
[19:30:50] <carpii> sorry i dont understand
[19:31:31] <carpii> which link?
[19:31:55] <AcademyIntl> Regarding posting a job offer: A job offer page should have the project details, timeframe, budget, distinct requirements and a place people can bid or comment on the job itself; including a place people can ask questions about the job to get more information.
[19:32:03] <AcademyIntl> That's common sense for any job description, not just for posting in an IRC.
[19:32:23] <carpii> ok, fair enough :)
[19:33:09] <carpii> if anyone is interested, please pm me :)
[19:33:26] <carpii> while i prepare something better
[19:36:11] <brettfrable> is there anyone in here to help?
[19:36:22] <carpii> who knows, whats the problem?
[19:41:22] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/7/
[19:41:28] <brettfrable> i'm half way there
[19:41:52] <brettfrable> i need the div to start at 800 pix - stay centered horizontally and vertically with page scroll
[19:42:03] <brettfrable> but I need the div to also shrink when the user scrolls down
[19:42:13] <brettfrable> then grow when the user scrolls up
[19:42:23] <brettfrable> all while staying centered vertically and horizontally
[19:42:50] <carpii> first thing id do is get rid of the animation, until youve got a basic resizer working
[19:43:39] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/8/
[19:44:16] <brettfrable> how could i accomplish this
[19:45:59] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/11/
[19:46:02] <carpii> this kinda thing?
[19:47:26] <GingerSwede> oh crap!
[19:47:34] <GingerSwede> it's 5am almost D:.
[19:47:49] <brettfrable> yes
[19:48:07] <brettfrable> now i just need that animation and to keep it centered
[19:48:11] <carpii> why does it need to animate? It just makes it look like crappy netscape from 1995?
[19:48:37] <GingerSwede> Well... people won't believe I spent a good 5 hours volontary playing with jQuery xD (I'm known to enter fetal possition and cry when I have to use javascript).
[19:48:42] <carpii> i think maybe the 'top' is better handled in css or html5 maybe too
[19:48:44] <GingerSwede> night and thanks for your help :).
[19:48:57] <brettfrable> it doesn't need to animate
[19:48:59] <carpii> repositioning it in jquery is always going to lag a bit
[19:49:03] <azbyin> how do i select the immediately (following) adjacent span of a div?
[19:49:09] <brettfrable> it just needs to stay centered vertically and horizontally
[19:49:09] <azbyin> i can select the div with its id
[19:50:40] <carpii> azbyin: maybe something like $("#div").children(".hello").each( function() { alert $(this).attr("id"); } )
[19:50:54] <carpii> or uh
[19:50:59] <carpii> .next() would probably make more sense
[20:01:29] <brettfrable> carp√≠ you still working on it
[20:01:35] <brettfrable> carpii
[20:01:53] <carpii> nope
[20:02:11] <carpii> not entirely sure what it is you want
[20:02:18] <carpii> plus i have my own problems ;)
[20:03:29] <brettfrable> well i need it to resize on scroll and stay centered vertically and horizontally when it resizes
[20:03:38] <brettfrable> it's not staying centered when i resize horizontally
[20:04:20] <carpii> the jsfidlle version you pasted seems to
[20:05:14] <brettfrable> not when it shrinks
[20:05:31] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/19/
[20:05:35] <brettfrable> you'll see what i mean
[20:06:01] <carpii> i dont though
[20:06:06] <carpii> its staying centered
[20:06:23] <carpii> albeit too wide to display, because you set the width already
[20:07:45] <brettfrable> well - if i shrink it to 200 px
[20:07:54] <brettfrable> its not centered in the middle of the window
[20:08:11] <brettfrable> it's centered and to the left.
[20:08:16] <carpii> but youve told it to be 800px wide in your css
[20:09:25] <carpii> ok, you mean when its animating?
[20:09:40] <carpii> you set marginTop and width dynamically at that point
[20:09:45] <carpii> but you need to set left also
[20:13:59] <carpii> something like this
[20:13:59] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/32/
[20:14:30] <carpii> or this if you want it animated
[20:14:31] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/34/
[20:14:51] <carpii> but really i cant imagine the animation is ever going to be a good idea
[20:15:18] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4TYaC/17/
[20:19:51] <brettfrable> i think this about nails it!
[20:19:52] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/38/
[20:20:24] <brettfrable> on the initial scroll it gets bigger first
[20:20:25] <brettfrable> hor come
[20:20:27] <brettfrable> how*
[20:20:33] <Whirl3d__> it doesn't work for me at all
[20:20:50] <Whirl3d__> can't even get it to scroll at all
[20:20:55] <brettfrable> whirl3d_ you talking to me
[20:21:04] <Whirl3d__> yup
[20:21:15] <brettfrable> what isn't working?
[20:21:20] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4TYaC/22/
[20:21:24] <Whirl3d__> it isn't scrolling
[20:21:37] <Whirl3d__> it starts to (jumps a little) and then stops
[20:21:59] <brettfrable> hm
[20:22:06] <brettfrable> it scrolls for me when i use the scrollbar
[20:22:13] <brettfrable> but it won't scroll if i use the gestures on my mouse
[20:23:00] <Whirl3d__> I see. If i use the arrows, I can see it change size. Is that the behavior you are looking for?
[20:23:25] <brettfrable> well
[20:23:27] <brettfrable> yes and no
[20:23:33] <brettfrable> i needed it to change width - not height
[20:23:45] <brettfrable> and i'd have to be able to use scrolling with my mouse
[20:24:03] * carpii snaps pencil
[20:24:11] <carpii> ok im outta here, gluck :)
[20:24:40] <Whirl3d__> carpii, you didn't mention what you wanted done with those ducks
[20:25:08] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4TYaC/24/
[20:26:01] <brettfrable> nice!
[20:26:08] <brettfrable> i just don't know why it's not scrolling with my mouse
[20:26:25] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/38/
[20:26:35] <brettfrable> this works perfect other than the fact that the first time you scroll down
[20:26:38] <brettfrable> it gets bigger first
[20:27:02] <Whirl3d__> and it's sooo jumpy
[20:27:19] <Whirl3d__> let the css handle your positioning for you
[20:28:03] <shoky> brettfrable: also change the 'left' _after_ changing the 'width'
[20:28:29] <Whirl3d__> or let css handle the centering all together
[20:29:02] <Whirl3d__> shoky! Hey man I wondered where you were. Though maybe they were working you too hard again.
[20:29:17] <shoky> hey ;p
[20:29:32] <shoky> i've been working yah. never too hard tho ;]
[20:31:54] <azbyin> what are the other ways to toggle a checkbox?  other than .click() ?
[20:32:43] <coldhead> .attr('checked', 'checked')
[20:32:53] <azbyin> thanks coldhead
[20:33:07] <coldhead> or you can manipulate the element directly in pure JS
[20:34:18] <azbyin> what about going to the unchecked state?
[20:34:28] <azbyin> .attr("checked", "unchecked") ?
[20:34:43] <coldhead> yup
[20:35:32] <Whirl3d__> isn't .prop preferred?
[20:35:42] <azbyin> i'm on 1.5.1 :)
[20:35:52] <azbyin> no .prop there
[20:35:54] * kurol wakes up
[20:36:00] <Whirl3d__> good ole days. LOL
[20:36:10] <kurol> you should do .removeAttr('checked') to uncheck
[20:36:15] <azbyin> yup
[20:36:19] <azbyin> unchecked does not work
[20:36:24] <coldhead> i'm never moving to prop()
[20:36:30] <coldhead> it's scary and weird
[20:36:47] <kurol> it's especially weird if you have to handle IE7
[20:37:03] <kurol> I don't go below IE7, I imagine it's gets even weirder
[20:37:26] <kurol> .prop() returns different stuff depending on what version of IE you're in
[20:37:51] <kurol> or was it .attr? I forget now. IE! yay!
[20:37:57] <azbyin> coldhead, i figured out my issue
[20:38:05] <coldhead> oh yeah?
[20:38:33] <azbyin> the crazy openlayers guys have bound mouseup instead of click on the radios and checkboxes!!
[20:38:39] <azbyin> and i cannot change those
[20:39:10] <coldhead> thanks so much, openlayers guys
[20:39:12] <azbyin> but luckily they have tied "click" on the spans (with the text) right next to the radios/checkboxes
[20:39:14] <azbyin> indeed
[20:39:19] <azbyin> frigging crazy dudes
[20:42:23] <coldhead> took you 24+ hours to get to the bottom of it
[20:42:30] <coldhead> that's very annoying
[20:42:38] <azbyin> indeed, very annoying
[20:49:05] <brettfrable> Can anyone help me figure out why what Whirl3d__ did won't scroll with the mouse
[20:49:05] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/4TYaC/30/
[20:49:10] <brettfrable> only when you click the arrows
[20:49:29] <brettfrable> It's a perfect solution
[20:49:34] <brettfrable> just need it to work with the mouse
[20:50:59] <tw2113> i can get it to work with my mouse scrolling
[20:51:06] <tw2113> just don't start with your cursor over the box
[20:53:35] <brettfrable> well in terms of usability
[20:53:40] <brettfrable> that shouldn't matter ya know
[20:54:18] <kvnn> is there a way to make local images load more slowly, so I can test my pre-loading code?
[20:55:27] <compact> hi,ive downloaded http://ekallevig.com/jshowoff/ and using the top right slideshow plugin
[20:55:38] <compact> ive got a menu, and uses the class 'description' to put a box on the image
[20:55:45] <compact> how can i get it to show on the slideshow images
[20:58:30] <brettfrable> ugh its just when my mouse is on the blue box
[20:58:41] <tw2113> [10:51pm] <tw2113> just don't start with your cursor over the box
[20:59:01] <tw2113> oh wait, i mixed the wording uo
[20:59:02] <tw2113> up*
[20:59:08] <tw2113> fuck *goes to his corner*
[20:59:35] <coldhead> do you want someone to kick you, tw2113 ?
[20:59:41] <tw2113> *bends over*
[20:59:50] * coldhead backs away
[21:00:05] <brettfrable> i mean
[21:00:09] <brettfrable> that shouldn't make a difference
[21:01:06] <ImBcmDth> brettfrable: why not? why should the browser know to scroll a box you aren't over anymore
[21:01:34] <brettfrable> it wasn't scrolling when the cursor was on the box
[21:01:37] <brettfrable> instead the other layer
[21:01:39] <shoky> pointer-events: none;    takes care of it :P
[21:01:40] <brettfrable> it was the css
[21:01:42] <brettfrable> fixed it
[21:01:43] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/4TYaC/31/
[21:02:35] <shoky> that doesn't fix it
[21:02:45] <compact> any idea
[21:02:51] * ImBcmDth tries to imagine an instance where this is a good thing to do on a site
[21:04:42] <brettfrable> does for me shoky
[21:04:57] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4TYaC/29/
[21:07:30] <Whirl3d__> I didn't understand the issue. You want to be able to use the mousewheel to scroll even when over the center box, right?
[21:07:39] <brettfrable> yes
[21:07:54] <brettfrable> i need to be able to use mouse wheel when the mouse is hovered over the box
[21:08:14] <Whirl3d__> lol. I thought you didn't want it to scroll when over the center box. just change the scroll selector
[21:08:16] <brettfrable> but the bg class is what has the scroll
[21:08:21] <brettfrable> not the container id

[21:48:59] <Whirl3d__> compact, I'm afraid I've never heard of jshowoff before and I don't have time to learn it for ya, I'm not gonna be of much help. I'm sorry.
[21:49:02] <tw2113> compact you want to put a menu over the slideshow?
[21:49:22] <Whirl3d__> tw2113 to the rescue!
[21:49:35] <tw2113> i had to scroll up awhile to remember the question
[21:49:59] <tw2113> and all i'm doing in #wordpress is flinging shit back and forth with someone else
[21:50:00] <compact> yes, ive got a css class called "description". work sliek<div class="description">content</div>
[21:50:04] <compact> and wont that to show over slideshow
[21:50:14] <compact> will use another plugin if i have to
[21:54:31] <tw2113> $('#features').append('<div class="description">content</div>');
[21:55:04] <tw2113> then alter your css for .description
[21:55:13] <tw2113> you'll want a high z-index
[21:55:23] <brettfrable> huh
[21:55:28] <brettfrable> i didn't get that
[21:55:58] <tw2113> get what?
[21:56:02] <tw2113> i was talking to compact
[21:56:20] <compact> ok thanks
[21:56:30] <tw2113> eh, that sort of worked
[21:56:43] <tw2113> i think the contents of #features may be getting replaced
[21:57:10] <tw2113> maybe $('.jshowff')
[21:59:56] <tw2113> for selector purposes and your own, add an ID to that outtermost div
[22:00:07] <Blaker1000> Hi. I am looking to create a jquery plugin and I am trying to figure out how to access 'speak' and 'someOjbect' within the jquery plugin template: https://github.com/karimmaassen/jQuery.Plugin.js/blob/master/js/libs/jquery.plugin.js . Any ideas?
[22:00:29] <tw2113> no plugin needed compact
[22:00:42] <Blaker1000> I was thinking I could do: $j(ELEMENT).plugin({}).someObject
[22:00:47] <Blaker1000> right?
[22:00:48] <compact> ok one sec
[22:00:48] <compact> trying
[22:02:32] <Blaker1000> or $(ELEMENT).plugin({}).speak() ?
[22:03:17] <tw2113> to be honest compact, i'm not sure why you'd need to add this with jquery, you could probably just add it yourself within the right div element
[22:03:38] <compact> doesnt have to be jquery, thought would be easiest
[22:05:14] <tw2113> looking over things, maybe it wraps the selected element in its own div
[22:05:31] <tw2113> eg $('#features').jshowoff({ speed:1500, links: false }); }); makes div#featured wrapped in a div
[22:05:36] <tw2113> so you would need jQuery
[22:07:41] <compact> hrm
[22:09:02] <tw2113> i got it to work on the site itself
[22:09:09] <tw2113> with firefox scratchpad
[22:10:36] <compact> able to show? :P
[22:10:48] <tw2113> i can just show the code i used
[22:10:56] <compact> if possible :P
[22:11:14] <tw2113> $('.jshowff').append('<div class="description">content</div>');
[22:11:23] <tw2113> and then style the .description class
[22:11:48] <tw2113> oops
[22:11:53] <tw2113> $('.jshowoff').append('<div class="description">content</div>');
[22:12:00] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance jQuery/Node.js developer? PM me!
[22:12:08] <tw2113> you'll probably want to have this after the jshowoff part executes so there's something to attach to
[22:12:30] <compact> $('#features').jshowoff({ speed:3000, links: false, controls: false });  							    							   $('.jshowoff').append('<div class="description">content</div>');
[22:12:31] <compact> ?
[22:13:40] <tw2113> i don't know what you have in your own implementation of the site
[22:13:51] <tw2113> do you have a link for it?
[22:14:30] <tw2113> you need to make sure your selectors are using what YOU actually use
[22:16:51] <compact> iev got it to show
[22:16:54] <compact> but isnt on the picture
[22:16:56] <compact> its underneath
[22:17:10] <tw2113> so alter the css
[22:17:16] <tw2113> position: absolute
[22:17:18] <tw2113> z-index
[22:17:28] <tw2113> stuff like that
[22:17:59] <tw2113> which is why i was talking about styling the .description class
[22:18:45] <compact> tried that. http://pastebin.ca/2174499
[22:19:59] <tw2113> is description a class or ID ?
[22:20:15] <compact> ive changed it to class
[22:20:17] <compact> then nothing show
[22:20:25] <compact> as in changed it to .description
[22:21:02] <tw2113> is it attaching the div to the dom at least?
[22:21:13] <tw2113> like when you inspect it with firebug or chrome
[22:22:01] <compact> yup
[22:23:32] <tw2113> then the rest is all css
[22:24:01] <tw2113> also why this? visibility:hidden;
[22:24:10] <tw2113> that's going to hide it
[22:26:58] <compact> ah got it, ty
[22:27:33] <compact> any idea how i can get it <description< to move left
[22:27:35] <compact> a little
[22:30:16] <tw2113> adjust the left parameter
[22:30:34] <tw2113> left: 0
[22:37:08] <compact> sorry, last question
[22:37:21] <compact> ive got several onclicks to display different messages using description
[22:37:28] <compact> how can i get it to close the previous descriptiondiv
[22:37:54] <tw2113> dunno, that's one i'd have to tinker with and try things for
[22:38:05] <tw2113> just as a throw out there idea
[22:38:18] <tw2113> use jQuery to select the description div and then use html()
[22:39:10] <tw2113> $(SOMETHING).on('click', function() { $('.description').html('something'); });
[22:40:24] <compact> ok thanks
[22:40:43] <compact> but where would i append
[22:42:14] <tw2113> inside the click function, it'd swap out the content in <div class="description">THIS WILL BE REPLACED</div>
[22:43:41] <thomas`-> Hi all I have a quick question
[22:45:06] <thomas`-> Is it possible to select the direct child elements of a parent keeping in mind the children may be any type of element
[22:46:16] <klocatelli> > *
[22:46:39] <klocatelli> that should do what you want
[22:46:50] <sente> this is a nub question.. but does jquery support xpath expression's
[22:47:00] <thomas`-> ill try it thanks
[22:47:37] <styol> thomas`-: one jquery option is .children() which will children regardless of type
[22:47:45] <styol> *which will select children
[22:49:17] <styol> other options http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[22:49:24] <thomas`-> yeah ive just noticed it does exactly same hting as > *
[22:49:43] <thomas`-> my error seems to be elsewhere :(
[23:03:06] <tw2113> try it and see compact
[23:03:13] <tw2113> also, no PMs
[23:03:49] <compact> nothing shows :\
[23:04:26] <tw2113> it was a "throw it out there" idea, and i also have no jsfiddle or link to tinker with
[23:13:17] <compact> got it tw2113
[23:13:23] <compact> just $('div.description').hide(); on click
[23:13:25] <compact> works :)
[23:13:37] <tw2113> and then you replace it?
[23:13:46] <compact> yup
[23:14:17] <tw2113> whatever works i suppose
[23:14:19] <compact> works for other clicks except its on
[23:32:32] <compact> hey tw2113, i keep playing with left in .description
[23:32:33] <compact> but not doing anything
[23:33:56] <tw2113> and i can't help you at this point because i can't see anything
[23:34:06] <tw2113> especially when it's a visual issue :P
[23:37:03] <tw2113> have you tried negative values?
[23:38:30] <Andweeeee> questionmarks: I hate mixing css in with jquery and I'm only seeing people use jquery to set css properties individually rather than switching classes.
[23:38:37] <Andweeeee> is there a way to not do that.
[23:38:47] <Andweeeee> syntax question.^
[23:39:03] <Andweeeee> and that should end with a questionmark. sorry.
[23:39:29] <tw2113> use jQuery to change out classes and avoid css setting?
[23:39:34] <tw2113> didn't you just answer your own question
[23:39:50] <Andweeeee> i know, right.
[23:39:54] <Andweeeee> no
[23:40:01] <Andweeeee> ok hold on
[23:40:07] <juha_> wut wot
[23:41:55] <Whirl3d__> tw2113 did you just float an air biscuit in this channel or do I smell a troll?
[23:42:18] <tw2113> return true
[23:42:35] <Whirl3d__> lol
[23:43:29] <Andweeeee> example. assume element's width is 100px.   $("element").animate({ width: 200px }, 300);
[23:43:29] <Andweeeee> not that.
[23:43:29] <Andweeeee>  $("element").animate({ "classwhatever", 300);
[23:44:25] <Whirl3d__> you shouldn't see a lot of the second one because it's not valid
[23:44:47] <Andweeeee> Whirl3d the other day you pointed me to a plugin that manipulates box shadows. this is the larger issue.
[23:44:55] <Andweeeee> I know‚Ä¶.it;s just...
[23:44:57] <Andweeeee> like...
[23:45:11] <tw2113> wouldn't the latter one animate everything
[23:45:17] <Andweeeee> gha. you can't animate a change in class? you have to set each property individually?
[23:45:20] <tw2113> while the first one would animate the width only
[23:45:45] <Whirl3d__> you can animate a class, but the jquery animate engine does not do box-shadows (hence the plugin)
[23:46:39] <Whirl3d__> http://jqueryui.com/demos/addClass/
[23:46:53] <Whirl3d__> http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggleClass/
[23:46:54] <Andweeeee> yeah but can you animate a class *change*. if i have class a with 30 different values, and class b with 30 different values, and I want to morph class a into class b...
[23:47:15] <Whirl3d__> http://jqueryui.com/demos/switchClass/
[23:47:18] <Andweeeee> if so. semantics
[23:47:29] <Whirl3d__> have you looked at any of those links?
[23:47:55] <Andweeeee> I've done the toggle//add ones, not the switch one.
[23:48:31] <Andweeeee> I'll look into it, but does what I'm describing at least make sense to the outside world or did i phrase it stupidly. I do that.
[23:49:29] * tw2113 learned a new function
[23:49:49] <Andweeeee> *the more you know*
[23:50:18] <tw2113> Whirl3d__ can you use switchClass() to switch 2 classes on completely different elements, separate from the one you click
[23:50:37] <tw2113> *goes to tinker*
[23:50:44] <Andweeeee> inception.^
[23:50:47] <Andweeeee> wait.
[23:50:54] <Andweeeee> conception^
[23:51:30] <Whirl3d__> I don'tthink click is bound up in any of these
[23:56:10] <tw2113> must be a UI only thing
[23:56:21] <Andweeeee> what is
[23:56:26] <tw2113> switchClass
[23:56:30] <Whirl3d__> yep
