[00:00:12] <Cork> either your script runs before jquery has been added
[00:00:16] <Cork> or the loading fails
[00:00:28] <mogaj> ok will check
[00:01:27] <ph88> why do so many people not upgrade their jQuery o_O
[00:01:41] <Cork> ph88: cause it often breaks sites
[00:01:57] <Cork> but ya, it isn't that hard, and ppl just don't bother i think
[00:02:09] <ph88> oh i thought the whole 1.* branch was suppose to be backward compatible O_o
[00:02:15] <Cork> no
[00:02:25] <ph88> one mystery solved
[00:02:25] <mogaj> okay fine ... got fixed thank you guys
[00:02:32] <Blade_> hey
[00:02:41] <Blade_> if($('#popup').is(':animated')){ alert("yes!"); } why doesn't that work q.q
[00:02:46] <Cork> 1.4 > 1.5 broke a lot, 1.5 > 1.7/1.8 was another one
[00:03:01] <Cork> Blade_: cause #popup isn't animating?
[00:03:04] <Blade_> #popup has fadeIn();
[00:03:08] <Blade_> its been fadein
[00:03:18] <Blade_> isn't that animated?
[00:03:23] <Cork> is it animating while that line runs?
[00:03:27] <Blade_> yes
[00:03:31] <Blade_> Basically...
[00:03:35] <Blade_> ill explain this in a short version
[00:03:40] <Cork> ?p
[00:03:40] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:03:53] <ph88> i think jQuery should make convenience functions to work with css transitions
[00:04:01] <Cork> but basically yes :animated should work
[00:04:17] <Blade_> You click an image, div fades in. I have a simple document.click function and I have that code in it
[00:04:20] <Cork> ph88: convenience?
[00:04:24] <Blade_> and checks if div is faded
[00:04:30] <Cork> Blade_: please make a demo
[00:04:36] <Blade_> alright!
[00:05:03] <Cork> ph88: if you mean for the prefixes, not really those are going away anyway
[00:05:06] <ph88> Cork: well after an element has just been added to the dom ... doing a transition will let it go to it's final state immediately ... unless you apply a small timeout
[00:05:27] <Cork> ph88: no, no timeout needed
[00:05:34] <Cork> (i think we talked about this last week)
[00:05:47] <ph88> yes
[00:05:49] <Cork> ph88: but the browser needs to do a reflow
[00:05:54] <Cork> so you need to trigger that
[00:06:03] <ph88> yes, but your trick with height() didnt work for me
[00:06:06] <Cork> .height() or .width() is the simplest way to do that
[00:06:16] <ph88> and also this looks a bit like a hack to me ...
[00:06:17] <Cork> ph88: then your doing it wrong :)
[00:06:21] <ph88> :)
[00:06:36] <Cork> ph88: it is less of a hack then adding a timer to wait for a reflow to happen
[00:07:20] <ph88> ye that's why i say would be nice to have jQuery function for that
[00:07:26] <Cork> ph88: and the reflow part is for when you append things
[00:07:29] <ph88> jQuery.reflow() maybe
[00:07:35] <Cork> ph88: it would just do the same thing anyway
[00:08:02] <Cork> well fine $.fn.reflow = $.fn.height;
[00:08:03] <Cork> done
[00:08:08] <Blade_> http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/
[00:08:38] <Blade_> or need something better
[00:08:51] <Cork> preferably a working image link :)
[00:08:56] <Blade_> alright
[00:08:58] <Blade_> ill make it
[00:08:59] <Cork> the rest is fine
[00:09:02] <Blade_> not use a file then
[00:10:29] <Cork> ph88: though remember that this only works for initial animations; from when you add it to the dom
[00:10:54] <Cork> ph88: if you want to wait for animation to finish you need to use transisionend
[00:11:00] <ph88> ye
[00:11:04] <Cork> (with the prefixes)
[00:11:31] <ph88> does event name doesnt have prefixes i hope ??? o_O
[00:11:32] <Blade_> http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/1/ alright well it works right now..but it doesn't alert after its animated
[00:11:41] <Cork> ph88: they do
[00:11:46] <ph88> OMG !
[00:11:48] <Blade_> and I appreciate you being here to help us
[00:11:58] <Blade_> I could tip you $5 or something if its a trouble
[00:12:32] <ph88> PACMAN !!!!!!
[00:12:43] <Cork> ph88: its transisionend, oTransitionEnd, otransitionend and webkitTransitionEnd
[00:12:56] <Cork> opera has two versions :/
[00:13:03] <ph88> !@#$%^&*()
[00:13:06] <Cork> ie and firefox runs wihtout prefixes
[00:13:51] <ph88> i
[00:13:51] <Cork> and no opera doesn't support both, it differs between versions
[00:13:58] <ph88> ll take that into consideration ^^
[00:14:03] <ph88> Blade_: what are you trying to do
[00:14:10] <Cork> transitionend is the final version though
[00:14:18] <Blade_> I'm trying to get the if animated to be true
[00:14:22] <Blade_> because what I have on my website is
[00:14:46] <ph88> i like your pacman :>
[00:15:03] <Cork> ?:animated @ Blade_
[00:15:03] <bot-t1> Blade_, :animated: Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[00:15:13] <Cork> "progress of an animation" <--
[00:15:26] <Cork> Blade_: so what your seeing is expected
[00:15:28] <Blade_> when they click an image, a div fades in with information, when they click out of it it fades out..but I want to check in the fade in function, to see if the div is already faded in.. because if it is, and they click another image while its faded in, it should fade out instead of trying to fade in another one
[00:15:36] <Blade_> and thanks I just found it on google cause he wanted an image
[00:15:38] <ph88> Cork: let me get this one :P
[00:16:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/2/
[00:16:07] <ph88> -____-
[00:16:30] <Cork> ph88: sorry already had it saved ^^
[00:16:34] <ph88> lolz :P
[00:16:51] <Blade_> ph88 go ahead if you want :p its good practice I havnet clicked it yet
[00:16:58] <Blade_> ph88: *
[00:17:00] <Cork> lol true
[00:17:49] <ph88> Blade_:  so you don't need that alert ?
[00:17:58] <Blade_> the alert was to see if it would run
[00:18:03] <ph88> ah right
[00:18:03] <Blade_> which on my website its not
[00:18:23] <Blade_> like...I want it to alert if the div is on the csreen animated, like if its already been faded in you know?
[00:18:47] <Blade_> cause if it is, and they click another image, instead of trying to fade in another div, ill make it just fade out
[00:19:09] <ph88> ye
[00:19:27] <ph88> but do both images need to fadeIn the same div with other content ? or different divs
[00:20:04] <Blade_> its the same div
[00:20:08] <Blade_> what I do is
[00:20:13] <Blade_> on the image, I have an id assigned to it
[00:20:46] <Blade_> and when it fades the div in, it calls a file with the XID= the id, so file.php?XID=101 and it puts the content it gets from that file into the div
[00:20:48] <Blade_> saves coding space!
[00:21:29] <Blade_> if($('#popup').is(':animated')){ alert("yes!"); }else { alert("no"); }
[00:21:33] <Blade_> I tried that and it says no every time
[00:21:38] <Blade_> even though I clearly see it animated :|
[00:23:11] <Blade_> so basically if its showing on the page or animated whatever :|
[00:23:27] <ph88> the only thing im not sure about is in document.click()  how to detect if it was clicked on an image or somewhere else in the document
[00:23:47] <Blade_> the document.click basically registers every click
[00:23:51] <Blade_> like
[00:23:55] <Mattias> Say I have a widget and I've added a few methods to it, now I create a dialog inside it and I want to use a method from the widget,  this._myMethod will not work, how can I get the parent "class" to use the method from it?
[00:24:04] <Blade_> thats just how I execute the function for testing if its animated
[00:24:06] <ph88> ye so how to know if that click was on an image or not
[00:24:11] <Blade_> nono
[00:24:13] <Mattias> the method is executed in the "accept" button
[00:24:17] <Blade_> dont worry about that right now
[00:24:17] <Mattias> it's a modal dialog
[00:24:19] <Blade_> right now what im trying to do
[00:24:22] <Blade_> is make it alert
[00:24:33] <Blade_> if the div is faded in, animated, visible you know?
[00:24:34] <Cork> Mattias: var self = this; dialog... sef._myMethod()
[00:24:38] <Blade_> idk the right code for that
[00:24:44] <Cork> *self
[00:24:52] <Mattias> Cork, thanks :) will try that
[00:25:37] <Blade_> ph88: do you know the code to see if its visible/animated?
[00:25:43] <ph88> yes i have that
[00:26:02] <Mattias> Cork, Flawless! (´・ω・｀)
[00:26:28] <Blade_> alright imma stick here for a bit to see if I can help some people out as well, though i'd probably be more helpful in #php
[00:26:30] <ph88> Blade_: http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/3/
[00:26:42] <ph88> im better at php :P
[00:26:52] <Cork> ?:visible
[00:26:53] <bot-t1> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[00:27:25] <Blade_> ill test!
[00:29:00] <Blade_> ph88: the opacity didn't work the correct one was what +bot-t1: and Cork: said x.x sorry but I appreciate you helping
[00:29:21] <ph88> what you mean it doesnt work ??
[00:29:37] <Cork> opacity should work as long as it is sat
[00:29:40] <Blade_> it was saying "yes"
[00:29:43] <Blade_> to the alert
[00:29:46] <Cork> but it can be 1 and still not visible
[00:29:46] <Blade_> even if it wasn't visible
[00:30:00] <ph88> ah right
[00:30:17] <Blade_> its ok ph88: im much better at php as well :p
[00:30:24] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/4/
[00:30:57] <Blade_> ya that works
[00:31:02] <Blade_> I dont think u need the opacity part tho
[00:31:05] <Blade_> could be wrong
[00:31:20] <ph88> well how else you want to detect that your fadeIn has completed ?
[00:31:39] <Blade_> hmm
[00:31:42] <Blade_> you have a good point
[00:31:58] <Cork> $('#popup').is(':visible:not(:animated)') ? :D
[00:32:11] <Cork> actually not sure if that works ^^'
[00:33:02] <Blade_> I think I got this working ^^
[00:33:15] <Blade_> heres what I got
[00:33:23] <Blade_> if(!$('#popup').is(':visible')){
[00:33:24] <Blade_> }
[00:33:32] <Blade_> inside there is where it fades in the popup
[00:33:36] <Blade_> but
[00:33:39] <Blade_> I'm trying to understand
[00:33:49] <Blade_> $('#popup').css('opacity') == 1 && if I need that?
[00:33:51] <Blade_> in the if
[00:33:54] <Blade_> as well
[00:34:03] <Blade_> what does that benfit ph88:
[00:34:15] <Cork> :visible checks if display is none or not
[00:34:19] <Cork> thats all it checks
[00:34:32] <ph88> opacity == 1      -> fadeIn completed
[00:34:44] <ph88> otherwise opacity will be between 0 and 1
[00:34:47] <Cork> so if it is in the animation state, it will still be display: block
[00:35:01] <Blade_> I did not know that :|
[00:35:17] <Cork> though i would prob recommend checking :animated instead of opacity, as it actually checks if animation of any kind is in progress
[00:35:21] <Cork> (like slideDown)
[00:35:27] <Blade_> well animated
[00:35:29] <Blade_> didn't work
[00:35:31] <Blade_> at all lol
[00:35:32] <Cork> it does
[00:35:36] <Blade_> idk why it didnt work for me
[00:35:41] <Cork> but it only triggers while it is animated
[00:35:45] <Blade_> oh
[00:35:46] <Blade_> thats why
[00:35:48] <Blade_> :p
[00:35:55] <Blade_> imma use the opacity as a double check
[00:36:42] <Cork> Blade_: also are you sure you actually need to handle the separate cases?
[00:36:52] <Blade_> what do you mean?
[00:37:07] <Cork> ?fadeToggle
[00:37:08] <bot-t1> .fadeToggle([duration], [easing], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[00:37:19] <Cork> just toggle the state of the element
[00:38:12] <Blade_> guess that would work
[00:38:19] <ph88> Blade_:  http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/5/
[00:38:19] <Blade_> ill make a jsfiddle of what I have working though
[00:38:22] <Blade_> so you can see
[00:39:06] <ph88> click image1 -> fadeIn image1 description -->  while being fadeIn click image2 --> fadeOut image1 description -> fadein image2 description
[00:39:07] <ph88> :D
[00:39:31] <ph88> i just don't have that document.click --> fadeOut handled ...
[00:39:45] <Blade_> ohh thats good
[00:43:14] <Blade_> thank you ph88
[00:43:20] <ph88> Blade_:  im not finished :P
[00:43:40] <Blade_> :p okay ill let you continue I'm taking the bits of that code though
[00:43:51] <Blade_>         var that = this;
[00:43:52] <Blade_> just a question
[00:43:57] <Blade_> why cant you just do $(this)
[00:43:59] <Blade_> its not that long
[00:44:09] <ph88> because this changed to #popup
[00:44:13] <Blade_> oh
[00:44:47] <ph88> maybe it's better to do    var content = $(this).attr('id');   and then just pass content
[00:44:57] <Blade_> makes sense
[00:45:16] <Blade_> and this worked fine I think
[00:45:23] <Blade_> dont think you need this.attrid
[00:46:48] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/eAPfs/8/  Blade_  final version :D   got it working with document click too now
[00:47:23] <ph88> Blade_:   this.attr('id')  ... was just there to put some dummy content to show which image was clicked ... in your case you want to put stuff from ajax there
[00:48:20] <Blade_> much better!
[00:48:23] <Blade_> flows much better
[00:48:26] <Blade_> thank you sir very mcuh
[00:48:28] <ph88> :D
[00:48:42] <Blade_> very good
[00:50:04] <Blade_> just one thing :p
[00:50:07] <Blade_> like cork said
[00:50:14] <Blade_> the div doesnt have an opacity to begin with
[00:50:17] <Blade_> so I dont think it needs that
[00:50:24] <Blade_> cause its not specified
[00:50:35] <Blade_> unless you beg to differ
[00:58:18] <ph88> what's your point ? o_O
[00:59:42] <ph88> it works ... you can check the opacity with console.log() see if you wanna tweak that a bit
[01:00:00] <ph88> if anything replace on line 18   $(document).click(function (e) {   with   $('body').click(function (e) {
[01:00:18] <Cork> ph88: the point is the check isn't needed if you count in the time the network connection takes
[01:03:54] <ph88> :D
[01:04:32] <ph88> would have to see that code with ajax then ... cuz now i dont know
[01:05:22] <Blade_> dont worry you got it right (y) I myself just didn't need the opacity
[01:06:44] <hkraal> I've several checkbox elements which I want to monitor trough "$("#checkactive").change(function() {" but it only reacts to the first #checkactive element. How can I make it "monitor" all elements on the page?
[01:07:09] <Blade_> hkraal: can you get a pastebin or jsfiddle?
[01:07:15] <motaka2> how can I do something so existing css apply to ajax loaded content ?
[01:07:27] <Cork> hkraal: id's is uniq
[01:07:29] <Blade_> motaka2: explain a little further
[01:07:35] <Cork> hkraal: you can't have it on more then one element
[01:07:41] <Cork> hkraal: use a class instead
[01:07:47] <hkraal> Cork: ok, tyvm :)
[01:08:01] <Blade_> let me get motaka2!
[01:08:24] <Cork> motaka2: it should apply just find as long as you not set it inline
[01:09:38] <Blade_> oh mann
[01:09:44] <Blade_> nvm you can take him its past 4am I gotta sleep
[01:09:50] <Cork> heh
[01:10:36] <motaka2> Cork: Blade_ is that true for media=print external css files? cause in print preview I still can see the menus I dont like
[01:10:55] <Blade_> night guys, ph88: my email is blademaker1@hotmail.com incase you ever need PHP help I've been coding it for a few years so incase you needed some help don't hesitate to ask, ill be here tomorrow for sure
[01:11:03] <Cork> Blade_: bye
[01:11:13] <Blade_> motaka2: cork is better off helping you, I dont do printing things with jquery
[01:11:21] <Blade_> take care guys! goodluck
[01:11:26] <Cork> motaka2: you don't have sources, you have in the dom; or not in the dom
[01:11:43] <Cork> motaka2: if it is in the dom, the css applies
[01:11:51] <Cork> if it isn't then it doens't apply
[01:12:04] <Cork> it's as simple as that
[01:12:11] <motaka2> Cork: I dont understand you
[01:12:31] <Cork> $('part of dom').html(data_from_ajax)
[01:12:54] <Cork> that will make the css linked to the document apply to that new content
[01:19:16] <ph88> Blade_: yes i do need php help right now ! lol
[01:19:18] <motaka2> Cork: but it seems this doesnt work in print mode i mean i still see parts of page i dont like when i prit preview, i have added the css like <link ... media="print" /> and it applies to currently loaded parts but not to dynamic loaded
[01:19:29] <motaka2> in print view only
[01:19:30] <Blade_> well I havent left my pc yet..so
[01:19:33] <Blade_> feel free to ask
[01:19:42] <Blade_> =.=
[01:19:55] <Cork> php => ##php ; stay on topic please
[01:19:55] <Blade_> I might call it quits though in a minute
[01:20:03] <Blade_> like I planned
[01:20:05] <Blade_> okay
[01:20:54] <Cork> motaka2: if you save the generated document to an html file is it hidden then?
[01:22:44] <Ov3rTaf> ne1 already used jquery DataTable plugin ? need some directions to customize it :)
[01:49:54] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone provide a poiner here: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/ I know it says it's not defined, but I still get the error when doing something like var jQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); etc. It's remedied when I add this file: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/skin/frontend/base/default/slideshowwidget/js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js, however the jQuery library is already loaded in the head...
[01:51:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to include the librarys in the correct order
[01:51:51] <Cork> your loading jquery last instead of before the plugins
[01:51:59] <haiQt> Hey guys, does anyone know how you can reference to a function inside an object literal notation of functions from WITHIN that object? Example: http://jsbin.com/enazeq/1/edit
[01:52:39] <Cork> haiQt: this.apiEndpoint
[01:53:43] <haiQt> Cork: I noticed some problems with the code I posted, updated version here: http://jsbin.com/enazeq/2/edit (added your this suggestion too) -- it still doesn't work though
[01:56:22] <Cork> haiQt: a function can reference to this, a static varaible (dataUrl) can't
[01:56:27] <Cork> *variable
[01:57:47] <Cork> haiQt: http://jsbin.com/enazeq/3/edit
[01:58:31] <haiQt> Alright, but is there a way to reference functions that are inside the same object from within a static variable?
[01:58:33] <haiQt> I suppose not?
[01:58:38] <Cork> no
[01:58:58] <Cork> you can't even reference the same object, cause it doens't exist yet
[01:59:04] <haiQt> Ok, thanks -- I realize that storing it like that is pretty useless anyway since it doesn't get modified
[01:59:08] <haiQt> Yeah I thought as much
[01:59:24] <haiQt> Thanks for the help :)
[02:02:03] <Cork> haiQt: not really useful for crossbrowser reasons but... http://jsbin.com/enazeq/5/edit
[02:04:24] <webchao> good day, i am struggling a bit understanding promises in jquery. can i turn any asynchronous function into a 'promising' function using .then()? in this specific example, i have a backbone collection, i call myCollection.fetch().then(myfunction);
[02:04:58] <Cork> webchao: promises is basically a fancy way to attach callbacks to a function
[02:05:22] <seutje> very fancy, indeed
[02:05:54] <Cork> if a function return a deferred object, the return value can then be used to bind callbacks to that object
[02:06:28] <webchao> my goal is to have a function which fetches several collections parallel, and resolving a promise after all collections are done fetching. Right now my information and reference is  http://sitr.us/2012/07/31/promise-pipelines-in-javascript.html
[02:06:32] <Cork> you have done/fail/always as the method used
[02:06:59] <webchao> i want to prevent nesting fetches in success calls
[02:07:10] <webchao> success callbacks*
[02:07:41] <webchao> so it depends on fetch() returning a deferred object..?
[02:07:46] <Cork> ya, you can collect the deferred objects and then run them to $.when(deferres).then(function() { /*when everything is done */ })
[02:07:52] <Cork> yes
[02:08:03] <webchao> aah i think i am getting the picture
[02:08:43] <webchao> yes, this is exactly what i want to do
[02:08:51] <webchao> thanks for the help/clarification :)
[02:08:59] <Cork> np
[02:24:14] <kai> hi folks
[02:24:38] <ravenzz> hi kai
[02:24:48] <alchimis_> hi every one, I am using   <input id="when-tf" type="datetime-local" name="when"> , for mobile web dev, my question is how to validate if user selected a datetime
[02:25:22] <kai> I'm trying to get a web-page that can be driven from one of these presentation remotes
[02:25:25] <alchimis_> if  i console.log($('#when-tf').val()) it is undefined
[02:25:49] <kai> I've got code to handle the forward and back buttons just fine, they're just pgup and pgdn after all
[02:25:51] <alchimis_> so any hint or guid how to take the selected date using jquery
[02:26:18] <kai> but I'd also like to do something on the "start presentation" button, and that happens to send an F5...
[02:26:20] <Cork> alchimis_: i would say datetime-local isn't ready yet
[02:26:29] <Cork> alchimis_: it only works in opera and safari
[02:26:33] <kai> is there a way I can catch F5 and do something useful instead of sending a reload?
[02:26:35] <Cork> (mobile)
[02:26:45] <alchimis_> but i am doing for safari
[02:26:52] <alchimis_> so it is okay for me
[02:27:12] <Cork> alchimis_: eh... you should develop for the web not for a specific browser...
[02:27:17] <alchimis_> any hint how to get the selected date via jquery
[02:27:29] <alchimis_> actually i am dev for mobile
[02:28:28] <kai> I know that grabbing reload isn't a very nice thing to do, but I blame powerpoint for deciding to use F5 to start presentations
[02:28:55] <Cork> alchimis_: val() should be the selected value unless the browser doesn't follow the standard (draft)
[02:29:43] <alchimis_> ok, so I think I am gonna switch to another datetimepicker, do u advice me any datetimepicker that is good for mobile
[02:29:47] <alchimis_> any link?
[02:29:59] <Cork> jqm or jquery ui
[02:31:45] <alchimis_> datetimepicker?
[02:32:03] <FJ1> Somebody here who can help me with TinyMCE 4?
[02:36:27] <yuka> alchimis_ why do you need to download such thing
[02:36:34] <yuka> just use the core UI datepicker
[02:36:37] <yuka> and make your own time picker
[02:36:39] <yuka> its so easy
[02:36:46] <yuka> even a 5 year old can do it
[02:36:55] <alchimis_> yuka:
[02:37:03] <alchimis_> can u explain me better
[02:37:05] <adek> I select td objects which are siblings to other td elements with var foo = $(".f7+td") and this should return me a list of elements. When I do foo.text() I get content of first td, how can I access the other? I tried foo[1].text() but no such method in TD object is what I get
[02:37:07] <alchimis_> or with some gist
[02:37:25] <alchimis_> write it in a gist yuka: thank you
[02:37:26] <yuka> well the core UI from jquery afaik ahs a datepicker
[02:37:35] <yuka> i won't make a timepicker for you..
[02:37:38] <yuka> do it yourself
[02:37:40] <LostInMyHead> ho un pulsante che se premuto si duplica, il duplicato non può riprodursi?
[02:37:41] <Cork> adek: $.map() or $().each depending on what you want to do
[02:37:42] <yuka> I am just saying its easy
[02:37:44] <yuka> https://github.com/keithhackbarth/jquery-datetime-picker
[02:37:49] <yuka> also there is several attempts by others
[02:37:50] <Cork> losted: english please
[02:37:50] <LostInMyHead> I have a button which when pressed is duplicated, the duplicate can not reproduce?
[02:37:54] <Cork> *LostInMyHead:
[02:38:29] <Cork> LostInMyHead: use depegated event listeners
[02:38:45] <Cork> LostInMyHead: check the delegate section see ?.on
[02:38:48] <bot-t1> LostInMyHead, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:38:52] <adek> Cork: I tried to print it in callback function to each and I get: TypeError: Object [ TD ] has no method 'text'
[02:39:14] <alchimis_> yuka: i saw the link, but i want something for mobile, I am not understanding why I shouldnt user datetimepicker or inpute type='datetime-local' and use the way you suggest
[02:39:52] <Cork> adek: if you want to collect the text from these elements do var tests = $.map($(".f7+td"), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() });
[02:40:39] <Cork> adek: if you want to act om the element and set it somewhere do $(".f7+td").each(function() { something($(this).text(); });
[02:40:46] <yuka> alchimis_ jquery mobile has
[02:40:48] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/gvuvC/ anyone have any idea why this works here but on my site the page reloads and i dont get the consolelog? i dont get it
[02:40:50] <yuka> one for mobile?
[02:40:50] <Cork> * $(".f7+td").each(function() { something($(this).text())); });
[02:40:56] <yuka> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/experiments/ui-datepicker/
[02:41:21] <Cork> anew: check for error messages
[02:41:32] <yuka> alchimis_ : http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox/
[02:41:35] <yuka> check this out
[02:41:52] <Cork> anew: might be for example that you try do bind $('#city-select') before the page has completely loaded
[02:42:02] <Cork> anew: (use $(function() {});
[02:42:06] <anew> what do u mean before the page loaded
[02:42:10] <anew> oh i'm using require.js
[02:42:18] <anew> that should take care of all that shouldnt it
[02:42:21] <anew> actually on this i'm not
[02:42:22] <Cork> anew: check that $('#city-select').length > 0
[02:42:24] <anew> let me try the function
[02:42:34] <anew> that's probably it
[02:42:35] <anew> let me see
[02:42:37] <alchimis_> yuka: may be u didnt understand my question, I dont get your poin, anyway I need datetime picker, It means date+time
[02:42:42] <adek> Cork: Thank you. What I was missing was $(this).text() instead of this.text()
[02:42:45] <alchimis_> not only datepicker or timepicker
[02:43:26] <yuka> alchimis_ open eyez
[02:43:28] <yuka> i gave you example
[02:43:30] <yuka> where you got all
[02:45:32] <yuka> http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox/
[02:45:45] <yuka> here on the right site you got boxes
[02:45:46] <yuka> date picker
[02:45:47] <yuka> time picker
[02:45:49] <yuka> all for mobile
[02:47:55] <webchao> whoo, the deferred thing works as expected! i now fetch 3 collections in parallel! thanks for help again :D
[03:12:58] <danfromuk> Hi. If I've got a series of objects with ids like this (object1,object2,object3), how can I select an object like this $("object" + a) ?
[03:13:20] <danfromuk> I mean, $("#object" + a)
[03:13:28] <Cork> where a is a number?
[03:13:34] <danfromuk> Yes
[03:13:40] <Cork> do just that
[03:13:58] <Cork> $("#object" + a) that is
[03:14:03] <danfromuk> I tried but it didnt work. I'll try again.
[03:16:59] <lemonsparrow> I am able to get the value of a vaiable in firebug but in code it returns undefined inside $.ready() method
[03:17:00] <lemonsparrow> what could be the mistake ?
[03:17:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it's not defined yet?
[03:17:39] <Cork> for ex. you might set it from an ajax call
[03:17:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:18:00] <Cork> or you just set it later in the page
[03:19:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I put it inside the ajax code block now no error but still it doesnt do what its supposed to do :(
[03:20:03] <Cork> "what it's supposed to"?
[03:20:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork: remove an dom element if length of data is 0
[03:21:07] <Cork> ?p
[03:21:07] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:25:59] <EvilNo0B> Hi people , i am writing a news script right now and i have a problem , now each article has an image , $send->thumb , now how is that possible to make that thumb always switch float direction like life right (for example instead of <img src=/".$send->thumb."/ style='float:left'> ) i want it auto change the style='float:left' to style='float:right' basically a loop that would do that , for example if the last article has the float set on right than
[03:25:59] <EvilNo0B> the next one would be set to left :S i know confusing but i just wanna make sure you understand what im talking about. any ideas?
[03:25:59] <EvilNo0B> or i should do that in the php itself ?
[03:27:29] <Cork> EvilNo0B: so you basically just want to replace float:<something> with float:<oposite> ?
[03:27:51] <Cork> EvilNo0B: to start with the simplest way to solve that is to just use classes
[03:28:26] <Cork> img.float { float: left; } img.float.right-side { float:right }
[03:28:42] <Cork> and then $('img.float').toggleClass('right-side')
[03:29:28] <EvilNo0B> Cork thanks :D
[03:32:36] <anew> cork i wrapped it in function() http://jsfiddle.net/gvuvC/1/ any other ideas why it might not be working on the live site but workinghere ?
[03:34:07] <Cork> anew: why are you assigning the return value from console.log to city?
[03:34:39] <anew> just so i can see it in console
[03:34:40] <anew> that it works
[03:34:59] <anew> e.preventDefault(); is not even working tho
[03:35:11] <anew> when i click the link, the page reloads.  nothing should happen
[03:35:41] <Cork> and if you add console.log($('#city-select').length) in the code before $('#city-select').click( it returns 1 ?
[03:36:53] <anew> testing now
[03:37:40] <anew> yes... i get 1
[03:37:42] <anew> then the page reloads
[03:37:50] <anew> so the preventdefault is not working for some reason
[03:37:55] <anew> well the entire clic()
[03:38:04] <Cork> so the click function triggers?
[03:38:25] <Cork> and no javascript errors?
[03:38:36] <anew> no js errors... click function looks like it's not triggering
[03:38:57] <anew> wth so weird
[03:39:00] <Cork> but you said you get 1 just before the page reloads
[03:39:05] <Cork> so where do you get the 1 from?
[03:39:19] * Cork needs to see more of this code...
[03:39:23] <anew> lol
[03:39:40] <anew> ok the 1 is loading when theh page loads
[03:40:03] <anew> which is correct (before the click)
[03:40:10] <Cork> hmm sounds like some other event listener might break things
[03:40:23] <anew> then when i actually do the js (the click) nothing works in there
[03:40:27] <Cork> but no i don't have any more ideas
[03:40:29] <anew> ok
[03:40:33] <anew> let me keep trying
[03:40:35] <anew> thanks a lot
[03:45:36] <EvilNo0B> Cork u there? i don't wanna be a pain in the... but i'm just getting into jquery :S maybe you could help me out ? http://jsfiddle.net/v44Nw/1/
[03:47:25] <Cork> EvilNo0B: http://jsfiddle.net/v44Nw/2/
[03:47:56] <danfromuk> Hi, I'm trying to select a label object and read the text from it. The labels have IDs 'label1,label2,label3.etc...', so I'm selecting using $("#label" +a) where a is a number. But it doesnt appear to be working properly. The .text and .val are all full of 'function()'. Not sure whats wrong. http://imagebin.org/264008
[03:48:27] <Cork> ?p @ danfromuk
[03:48:28] <bot-t1> danfromuk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:48:30] <anew> how can i see if there is any other js interferring ?
[03:48:35] <anew> there is nothing loading in console ...
[03:48:58] <Cork> anew: ripping out parts is normally the simplest way
[03:49:04] <AlienPenguin> hi all, i need to have a list of rows of filtered items using tablesorter. Is there a easier/more logical way than selecting all the rows that do not have the "filtered" class?
[03:49:06] <Cork> anew: though breakpoints might help
[03:49:28] <EvilNo0B> Corck: thanks!!!!! :D what if i remove the button ? i mean all i need is the switching float , no need buttons xD
[03:50:44] <Cork> EvilNo0B: the button was just to have something to do the switching with
[03:51:51] <EvilNo0B> Cork ahhh i just seen that u changed that html , :(( what i need is that img to switch class automatically , so all the img tags would have same class
[03:52:16] <Cork> EvilNo0B: html can't do things by them self
[03:52:27] <Cork> you need to run js to do modifications
[03:52:38] <simon``> I'm trying to close a greybox, but I get the (apparently famous) error that GB_CURRENT is null. I've tried looking around (top, parent, parent.parent, etc.) and can't see a non-null object anywhere. I have the impression that I may be opening the window in a way that doesn't enable it?
[03:53:06] <EvilNo0B> Cork: guess than php loop would be an easier option right ?
[03:53:22] <simon``> I assume that GB_CURRENT keeps track of a stack of greyboxes in case one opens another.
[03:53:28] <Cork> EvilNo0B: if you want to statically change things, then yes php is where it belongs
[03:54:47] <simon``> one solution I've seen is simply using redirection to get all greyboxes to disappear. but this would not work for layers of greyboxes.
[03:54:57] <EvilNo0B> Cork: Alright thanks , well its just i wanted the news thingy to have an ability to switch templates:P thanks for your time ^^
[03:54:59] <simon``> e.g. top.window.location = this.href;
[03:58:15] <xenaxon> hi, does anyone know SlickQuiz ?
[03:59:28] <dirigente> is it possible to stop execution of background ajax calls in browser?
[03:59:46] <Cork> dirigente: as long as you have a reference to the call; yes you can
[03:59:51] <Cork> jqxhr.abort()
[04:00:05] <dirigente> thanks
[04:00:53] <bgrotan> hi - have some issues with Datepicker. Fetching dates from Oracle using Java. Seems Datepicker malfunction with a varying degree of offset when the year is older than 1901 (example I have is 1801, and then even worse back in 1592)
[04:05:32] <xenaxon> does anyone know SlickQuiz ?
[04:05:38] <mrHAT> ok, i have this small function : http://pastebin.com/yj3P7KjG that handles the post requests in my application. I need a way to abort the previous request if another has been made to avoid problems. Is this the besy way to do it?
[04:06:15] <mrHAT> var xhrReq; i have this global defined...
[04:06:54] <Cork> mrHAT: i would prob scope the function and variable instead of making it global
[04:06:59] <Cork> but yes that is the way to do it
[04:07:03] <juria_roberts> When i console.log i see [object Object].How do i see which object it is?
[04:07:25] <bluesm> It's better to use find('li):first')
[04:07:28] <bluesm> Sorry
[04:07:36] <Cork> mrHAT: (function() { var xhrReq; window.tpAjaxPost = function() {}; })();
[04:07:51] <bluesm> It's better to use find('li').first()   than find('li:first')  Right ?
[04:07:59] <Cork> bluesm: yes
[04:08:11] <mrHAT> Cork why would you do it like that
[04:08:22] <Cork> mrHAT: cause then you isolate the variables
[04:08:32] <Cork> you don't set random values in the globa scope
[04:08:37] <Cork> *global
[04:08:38] <anew> cork seems i'm getting .length = 0 now...
[04:08:46] <bluesm> Cork: Because It's faster ? And if it is faster, does "parsing" the string is so expensive ?
[04:09:08] <anew> wait
[04:09:27] <Cork> bluesm: find('li:first') will in the end run find('li').first(), except it has to parse and loop the selection
[04:09:34] <anew> no
[04:10:02] <anew> cork what does .length = 0 mean
[04:10:08] <anew> not sure how that's happening there is text there
[04:10:14] <Cork> andr0m3da: length = 0 or length == 0 ?
[04:10:20] <Cork> ops
[04:10:23] <Cork> *anew:
[04:10:33] <anew> console.log($('#city-select').length);
[04:10:38] <anew> with that i get '0'
[04:10:40] <anew>  in console
[04:10:40] <Cork> ok so == 0
[04:10:47] <Cork> it means the selector doesn't find the element
[04:10:57] <Cork> so it doens't bind the click handler
[04:10:57] <anew> hmmm
[04:11:02] <anew> how the heck is that happening
[04:11:14] <Cork> your running it before it exists
[04:11:57] <juria_roberts> When i console.log i see [object Object].How do i see the actual object?
[04:12:11] <Cork> juria_roberts: depends on the debugger
[04:12:12] <anew> hah
[04:12:13] <anew> i got it
[04:12:16] <anew> i changed it from id to class
[04:12:26] <juria_roberts> Cork: firebug
[04:12:34] <juria_roberts> Cork: and chrome
[04:12:49] <Cork> juria_roberts: firbug shows the content of an object if you console.log it
[04:12:55] <Cork> and modern chrome does too
[04:12:59] <anew> wurd
[04:13:14] <Cork> but if it doesn't use JSON.stringify(object)
[04:13:29] <Cork> it might crash depending on what is in the object
[04:13:39] <Cork> but if the console doesn't support it, it is the best you can do
[04:15:34] <sikor_sxe> hello, i have a weird issue with the "parents()" fun
[04:15:36] <bytephilia> How can I make these sliders have different max values? http://jsfiddle.net/FEZjy/3/
[04:15:37] <sikor_sxe> ction
[04:15:39] <juria_roberts> Cork: If I do JSON.stringify(object) it shows "[Object object]"
[04:16:09] <Cork> bytephilia: run one .slider for each slider you want different
[04:16:25] <bytephilia> Cork: is that absolutely necessary?
[04:16:26] <Cork> juria_roberts: then the variable actually contains the string "[Object object]" and not an object
[04:16:31] <Cork> bytephilia: yes
[04:17:45] <bytephilia> Cork: have you used jQuery slider yourself?
[04:17:55] <Cork> ya?
[04:18:24] <bytephilia> ok I have a question
[04:18:45] <bytephilia> the slide method
[04:18:53] <bytephilia> in this code is is slide: function(event, ui) etc
[04:18:56] <Cork> you mean the slide callback?
[04:18:58] <bytephilia> yeah
[04:19:06] <bytephilia> the slide callback
[04:19:28] <bytephilia> I know that it's also possible to define a function elsewhere and call it, (as opposed to defining the function idrectly as in this exampe)
[04:19:30] <bytephilia> right?
[04:19:43] <bytephilia> but if I were to do that, how would I access the ui variable?
[04:19:44] <Cork> sure, just like all javascript functions
[04:19:51] <Cork> the same way
[04:20:03] <bytephilia> can you give me an example?
[04:20:06] <bytephilia> I failed to
[04:20:21] <Cork> slide: function(event, ui) {} is the same as function handler(event, ui) {}; slider: handler
[04:21:02] <bytephilia> oh
[04:21:03] <bytephilia> let met ry
[04:21:04] <bytephilia> try
[04:21:07] <Cork> bytephilia: there is nothing magical or jquery specific about the callbacks :)
[04:21:14] <bytephilia> right
[04:21:18] <bytephilia> I'm not used to JS lol
[04:21:24] <bytephilia> a little lost
[04:21:28] <bytephilia> but let me try
[04:22:07] <bluesm> Cork: Ok Thanks for your time :)
[04:23:41] <bytephilia> Cork does this look right? http://oo.ej.is/Q9vU
[04:24:34] <Cork> bytephilia: please don't use images
[04:24:40] <bytephilia> ah
[04:24:41] <bytephilia> sorry
[04:25:14] <bytephilia> http://pastie.org/private/qzrhgxj1g4nwp7rmlmwgg
[04:26:41] <Cork> bytephilia: ya, that looks fine
[04:27:08] <bytephilia> Cork: Ok I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined  thoug
[04:27:16] <sikor_sxe> i put a jquery-ui datepicker inline in my own popup widget. to check for a clicks outside the popup (and then hide it) i use parents() to find out wheter the clicks event target was within my popup or not. this works for several popups, in the one using the datepicker however i have a problem: when i click the datepicker's next button (to advance a month) $(event.target).parents() does return all parents up to body, but only .datepi
[04:27:16] <sikor_sxe> cker-next & .datepicker-header. parents() seems to work fine when clicking on date. :/ anyone knows what could be wrong here?
[04:29:03] <Cork> bytephilia: what line?
[04:29:16] <Cork> bytephilia: ah, missed that part
[04:29:25] <Cork> bytephilia: line 15 will break from the call on line 11
[04:30:10] <Cork> (you arn't sending the event and ui arguments)
[04:33:34] <mrHAT> Cork somebody in #javascript sugested i check against typeof xhrReq !== "undefined" && xhrReq.readyState === 1 && xhrReq.abort();
[04:34:06] <mobile8> webkit: cover,backgroundSize: cover
[04:34:11] <mobile8> how come this doesn't work well in Chrome?
[04:34:14] <Cork> mrHAT: ya, that or you set it to undefined on complete
[04:34:19] <mrHAT> since when jquery $.post returns the readyState prop ?
[04:34:40] <Cork> mrHAT: jquery doens't but the browser does
[04:34:57] <mrHAT> so better not rely on that
[04:35:04] <bytephilia> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/9xgzoa180npx7iw2crbema I guess the call on 11 cannot pass the event and ui arguments though?
[04:35:09] <mrHAT> xhrReq !== "undefined" is enough ?
[04:35:17] <Cork> if you on complete reset xhrReq = undefined
[04:35:27] <Cork> mrHAT: and the same after .abort() you should be safe
[04:35:40] <Cork> (note that i said complete, and not success)
[04:35:47] <mobile8> For some reason,
[04:35:48] <mobile8> https://gist.github.com/stowball/5299593
[04:35:53] <mobile8> This code, I cannot get to work in Chrome
[04:36:01] <mrHAT> and if i don't do it ?
[04:36:07] <mobile8> Although the only thing I can think of is $(window).resize(rwdImageMap).trigger('resize'); not properly working
[04:36:21] <Cork> mrHAT: you will try to abort things that isn't running
[04:36:36] <Cork> mrHAT: nothing terribly bad, just not needed
[04:37:10] <mrHAT> yeah
[04:37:57] <sikor_sxe> my datepicker-hide-on next problem is also mentioned here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13333571/jquery-ui-datepicker-doesnt-hide-when-click-outside (in answer #3), there's a workaround but no explenation why
[04:38:00] <mobile8> $that.maphilight(); $that.parent('div').css({webkit: cover,backgroundSize: cover}); - any reason why chrome wouldn't render this?
[04:38:44] <mobile8> forget  $that.parent('div').css({webkit: cover,backgroundSize: cover});
[04:39:03] <mobile8> $that.maphilight(); - anything wrong with this?
[04:39:14] <mrHAT> jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() deprecated as of jQuery 1.8 what do i use then ?
[04:40:36] <Cork> mrHAT: if you want the deferred versions its done, fail and always
[04:40:39] <mrHAT> never mind
[04:40:53] <mrHAT> yeah
[04:40:54] <mrHAT> found it
[04:41:48] <seutje> weird, ever had firefox remove whitespace in between attributes when grabbing it with innerHTML?
[04:42:45] <seutje> like el.parentNode.innerHTML; firefox gives me <svg style="position:relative;left:0px;top:0px;"xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ... (note the missing space in between style and xlink
[04:42:57] <mobile8> Cork or seutje any idea maybe about my issue
[04:44:40] <seutje> mobile8: webkit isn't a recognized css property afaik
[04:45:51] <mobile8> seutje: yep, but i don't think that's the issue
[04:45:56] <mobile8> i already commented it
[04:46:20] <seutje> well if u comment it out there's nothing left, so yeah, chrome isn't gonna do much
[04:46:51] <seutje> oh wait, this is area/map element related
[04:46:56] <mobile8> Well i've been trying to think of a reason why chrome wouldn't have this work well
[04:46:59] * seutje back away slowly
[04:47:08] <mobile8> So what's your solution, using flash :) ?
[04:47:19] <seutje> I don't even know wtf the goal is
[04:47:20] <shmoon> guys
[04:47:25] <shmoon> how do i select all td(2) in ALL tr's in a table ?
[04:47:26] <mobile8> seutje: can i pm you a live link
[04:48:09] <seutje> don't bother, I gotta work on this SVG mess
[04:48:23] <mobile8> ok
[04:49:20] <Neon> shmoon: I'd guess: table tr td(2)
[04:50:04] <shmoon> Neon: that selects td:eq(2) from the first tr, not all tr
[04:51:09] <mobile8> Cork: do you maybe know this?
[04:54:14] <mrHAT> Cork how the hell do i test this, my backend queries are so fast i cannot catch a pending request lol
[04:54:46] <mrHAT> hmm, put a sleep
[04:54:52] <Neon> shmoon: Did you try table tr td:nth-child(2)?
[04:55:00] <shmoon> nope wait
[04:55:07] <Neon> Works in CSS 3 at least.
[04:55:36] <shmoon> neat Neon
[04:55:42] <Neon> :D
[04:57:37] <mrHAT> Error: TypeError: xhrReq.abort is not a function
[04:57:38] <mrHAT> ups
[04:57:47] <mobile8> Hi, I'm using the resize trigger in chrome. When the resize takes place, I the coordinates area coordinates in the map get re-calculated. So far so good, this works in Chrome. However, on each resize I also enable another script again, called maphilight (which highlights the same area parts). This doesn't properly work in Chrome
[04:59:45] <mobile8> Any reasons? This is the script that highlights the area parts http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/jquery.maphilight.js
[05:14:41] <mobile8> Anyone?
[05:19:39] <Pieter> Does anyone know a good guide to JSON and JQuery
[05:25:07] <bluesm> jQuery 2.x still can't use Object.create ?
[05:45:15] <mobile8> how to detect if a function is been activated by resize trigger?
[05:45:30] <mobile8> any ideas?
[05:51:29] <Mattias> I'm creating an a tag with document.createElement, then later I create an onclick on this variable. I create several of these by looping through an array with data. to get the index variable stored correctly in the onclick function I have do do something like: (function(index) { return function() { console.log(index); })(index);   but now I don't get the event so I can do event.preventDefault(); How can
[05:51:29] <Mattias> I do this?
[05:59:41] <Mattias> return false; works there but I don't want to use that since it does more than preventDefault()
[06:02:34] <Mattias> hm, made a $(element).click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); above element.onclick and this seems to work, don't know if it will have any other side effects though
[06:03:52] <seutje> should avoid using onclick props
[06:05:42] <drager> Mattias: Use .on('click', function(e) instead
[06:06:06] <dAnjou> hi, is there any best practice consensus on how to do long polling with jquery properly?
[06:06:24] <dAnjou> i googled and found some approaches, but i'd like to do it .. right.
[06:06:31] <Mattias> drager, seutje will try that instead. thanks
[06:07:19] <dAnjou> unfortunately i can't use websockets and SSE. so that's out.
[06:09:50] <seutje> there's fallback solutions for WS
[06:10:21] <banister`gym> hey, how do i select a data attribute by value in jquery?
[06:10:35] <drager> banister`gym: .val()
[06:10:38] <banister`gym> is it just this: $("[data-foo='bar']") ?
[06:10:47] <banister`gym> sorry i mean match one
[06:10:53] <banister`gym> the part im not sure bout is the nested string
[06:11:05] <banister`gym> do i really but the ='bar' in there, inside the surrounding double quotes?
[06:11:23] <krawchyk> yes, you dont need the single quotes though, they are optional
[06:11:30] <banister`gym> oh
[06:11:37] <banister`gym> interesting
[06:11:43] <banister`gym> but if the value contained a space
[06:11:45] <krawchyk> unless there are special chars in the string you are interested in
[06:11:46] <banister`gym> then i'd need them?
[06:11:47] <krawchyk> yes
[06:11:50] <banister`gym> thanks
[06:11:58] <krawchyk> but it probably would never contain a space
[06:12:05] <krawchyk> more like a bracket or something
[06:12:08] <seutje> best practice to always use them though
[06:12:17] <banister`gym> can i have hyphens in data-attribute-names ?
[06:12:21] <krawchyk> seutje: why?
[06:12:21] <banister`gym> like data-friendly-dog
[06:12:32] <krawchyk> banister`gym: that is generally how you write them
[06:12:36] <seutje> krawchyk: cause it's a lot less error prone?
[06:12:53] <krawchyk> seutje: oh, i drop them, less visual noise but i can see your point
[06:13:02] <seutje> mere whitespace can trip it up
[06:13:28] <krawchyk> banister`gym: check this out http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors there are a ton of awesome selectors
[06:14:10] <Mattias> drager, getting the same issue with that method
[06:14:45] <banister`gym> krawchyk: cool
[06:16:29] <Mattias> drager, but I'm using 2x on('click'.. now to get the desired effects
[06:16:47] <drager> Mattias: Make a jsfiddle
[06:19:30] <Mattias> drager, I'll create one, but it might take a while. I'll post it in around 1 hour and ping you if you are still around then.
[06:19:40] <Mattias> Other things came up
[06:21:30] <drager> Mattias: Sure
[06:34:16] <mrHAT> http://pastebin.ca/2424694 why do i still get Error: TypeError: xhrReq.abort is not a function
[06:34:58] <mrHAT> Cork you here ?
[06:34:58] <Cork> sure
[06:35:27] <Cork> mrHAT: http://jsfiddle.net/9qSgE/
[06:36:38] <ph88> hi mrHAT
[06:36:51] <mrHAT> hi
[06:37:01] <ph88> hows it going with the templates ?
[06:37:10] <mrHAT> ahh yeah.. thanks for that
[06:37:13] <Cork> mrHAT: check what the variable is when you fail
[06:37:27] <Cork> or rather when you get the assertion
[06:38:35] <mrHAT> undefined
[06:38:52] <Cork> mrHAT: so why are you running abort on it when it is undefined?
[06:39:27] <systemfault> Also… you should never assign undefined.
[06:39:28] <mrHAT> if(typeof (xhrReq) !== 'undefined') {... i dont
[06:39:33] <Cork> mrHAT: btw you don't need to type cast it
[06:39:34] <mrHAT> but it still jumps in there
[06:39:48] <Cork> just check (xhrReq !== undefined)
[06:40:34] <mrHAT> now i get xhrReq is not defined error
[06:40:41] <Cork> O_o
[06:41:16] <mrHAT>   if(xhrReq !== undefined) {  drops xhrReq is not defined
[06:41:17] <Cork> mrHAT: check that you do have the var xhrReq; line
[06:41:17] <mrHAT> wtf
[06:41:46] <mrHAT> ahh yes i was missing that
[06:42:22] <mrHAT> but still i get the .abort is not a function
[06:42:25] <Cork> what xhrReq is now what?
[06:42:29] <mrHAT> lol
[06:42:36] <Cork> uh, i meant "and xhrReq is now what?"
[06:43:19] <mrHAT> well.. it turns out is an object
[06:43:29] <mrHAT> so i'm missing something
[06:44:11] <mrHAT> so i'm setting is as undefined on abort and complete
[06:44:15] <mrHAT> but still
[06:44:21] <mrHAT> it remains an object somewhere
[06:44:28] <Cork> mrHAT: it should be an object
[06:44:39] <Cork> jqxhr is an object
[06:44:43] <mrHAT> yes
[06:44:49] * robashton fluffles ajpiano lovingly
[06:44:51] <Cork> but it should still have the about function
[06:44:59] <ajpiano> =zomg
[06:45:00] <Cork> mrHAT: what version of jquery?
[06:45:04] <mrHAT> but ive set that as undefined on abort and complete
[06:45:13] <robashton> :D
[06:45:15] <Cork> mrHAT: always should be fine
[06:45:29] <mrHAT> still running 1.7
[06:45:49] <mrHAT> ahh damn
[06:45:51] <mrHAT> pfff
[06:46:31] <mrHAT> im using always()
[06:46:49] <Cork> mrHAT: can you reproduce the problem in a fiddle?
[06:47:08] <mrHAT> hmm
[06:47:09] <mrHAT> w8
[06:54:39] <mrHAT> Cork of course it does this.. of the backend script is still running the post request will not complete (always() will not kick in... so xhrReq will not be set as undefined)
[06:55:03] <Cork> mrHAT: ya, that is expected
[06:55:15] <mrHAT> heh
[06:55:20] <Cork> and that is the case when xhrReq.abort() should work
[06:55:24] <mrHAT> so is there anyway i can check if request is pending
[06:55:26] <mrHAT> ?
[06:55:41] <Cork> if xhrReq isn't undefined
[06:56:05] <mrHAT> ahh yes you are right damn
[06:56:51] <mrHAT> damn it
[06:57:00] <mrHAT> abort() is not a function again and again
[06:57:13] <Cork> inspect what xhrReq is
[06:59:28] <Cork> yay...
[06:59:40] <Cork> damn freenode has a lot of reliability problems lately
[06:59:47] <mrHAT> hah
[07:00:52] <mrHAT> Cork how do i see the contents of that objext and the methods it takes is this possible ?
[07:01:14] <Cork> depends on the developer tool
[07:03:53] <c4ptnh00k> can you serialize a div instead of a form?
[07:04:44] <Cork> c4ptnh00k: yes
[07:04:57] <Cork> as long as the element contains or is a form element
[07:05:05] <Cork> (input, select, and so on)
[07:05:34] <c4ptnh00k> Cork: awesome. Thanks
[07:12:23] <seutje> great
[07:12:43] <seutje> nickserv is down and ##javascript has asinine channel settings
[07:13:22] <trinode> ahh, I like it when you guess a channel name and it exists and has people in it :)
[07:18:57] <Cork> ...
[07:18:58] <seutje> is it just me or is classList a bit broken in safari?
[07:19:33] <trinode> for a seach input is there a way to actually handle an "ok" or "done" press on the keyboard?
[07:20:25] <Cork> trinode: what is an ok or done press?
[07:20:37] <vizzy_> Yeah I don't have those keys.
[07:20:42] <Cork> trinode: are you looking on a mobile keyboard?
[07:20:48] <trinode> Cork: yeag
[07:20:50] <trinode> yeah
[07:20:55] <Cork> trinode: those are just enter
[07:21:09] <Cork> have a form around your search field and bind submit and it should handle it just fine
[07:21:33] <trinode> Cork: ahh I did this: $(document).on('submit','#friendSearch',function ()
[07:21:42] <trinode> but it needs to be on the form not the field
[07:21:45] <trinode> ok
[07:21:50] <Cork> ya
[07:21:54] * trinode must add a form
[07:22:11] <Cork> it is the form that is submitted, not the individual fields
[07:22:37] <trinode> do I need to cancel the submission somehow?
[07:23:36] <Cork> trinode: yes event.preventDefault()
[07:23:52] <Cork> (event is the first argument to the callback function)
[07:24:23] <trinode> Cork: thanks
[07:25:20] <trinode> speaking of the search control, has anyone had rendering issues? on android the magnifying glass isn't there on one of our forms, I can't see why at all, on iOS or on desktop chrom it's fine
[07:26:10] <Cork> trinode: well it depends on how you put the magnification glass there
[07:26:22] <Cork> trinode: but yes, mobile has rendering problems all over the place
[07:27:06] <shafox> how to do something like the animated gifs that are done in sublimetext home page, i have looked into the source that used for making this but its in python and its very difficult to set up in my window machine and in my ubuntu box it just dont work . any alternative ??http://www.sublimetext.com/
[07:27:07] <trinode> Cork: by type="search" , jQM did the rest
[07:27:19] <Cork> ah, jqm
[07:28:01] <Cork> shafox: what animated gif?
[07:29:12] <Cork> shafox: ?
[07:29:49] <Mattias> so, I've written down a jsfiddle for my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/  how can I avoid doing like I do with preventDefault (I have two .on('click' on the same element)
[07:30:36] <Cork> Mattias: that code can be simplified a lot...
[07:31:21] <Mattias> Cork, enlighten me :)
[07:35:00] <trinode> cork: it didn't work right
[07:35:05] <trinode> $(document).on('submit','#friendSearchForm',function (event) {
[07:35:05] <trinode>     event.preventDefault();
[07:35:05] <trinode>     alert("yo!");
[07:35:05] <trinode> });
[07:35:24] <trinode> that displayed the alert but still changed page
[07:36:10] <Cork> Mattias: http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/1/
[07:36:23] <Mattias> Cork, thanks! I'll have a look now
[07:36:26] <Cork> Mattias: that said, don't use links if you don't plan to have a link
[07:38:06] <Cork> Mattias: this is what i recommend you do instead http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/2/
[07:38:25] <Cork> actually that can be simplified even more...
[07:38:30] <Mattias> Cork, I see, that simplifies it a lot :)
[07:39:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/3/
[07:39:38] <trinode> cork: nvm found answer data-ajax="false"
[07:39:39] <Cork> wow...
[07:39:47] <Cork> Mattias: never run for in on an array
[07:39:52] <Cork> it is risky
[07:40:24] <Mattias> Cork, Yeah, I can't delete while looping, right?
[07:40:35] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I've got a jquery plugin called WebSocket (http://code.google.com/p/jquery-websocket/) but it claims there is no method $.toJSON(). Consulting docs.jquery.com made it obviouse jQuery has no such a method. So where it comes from?
[07:40:42] <Cork> Mattias: no, but you can key things not in the array
[07:41:18] <Mattias> Cork, So what would you suggest using instead?
[07:41:24] * trinode listens in interest
[07:41:46] <Mattias> the actual array have over 300 items
[07:41:51] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[3] = 'hello'; var a = ['__1', '__2', '__3']; for(key in a) { print(key);print(' '); } @ Mattias
[07:41:54] <bot-t> Mattias: "0"" ""1"" ""2"" ""3"" "
[07:42:07] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[3] = 'hello'; var a = ['__1', '__2', '__3']; for(key in a) { print(a[key]);print(' '); } @ Mattias
[07:42:08] <bot-t> Mattias: "__1"" ""__2"" ""__3"" ""hello"" "
[07:42:15] <Cork> so don't use for in
[07:42:39] <Cork> if you want a normal loop use for(var i = 0;i < arr.length; i++) {}
[07:43:36] <Mattias> Cork, thanks! I'll convert my loops to that instead :)
[07:43:55] <Cork> Mattias: http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/4/
[07:43:58] <Cork> :)
[07:44:07] <Cork> can't compress it more now XD
[07:45:12] <Cork> opps
[07:45:40] <Cork> forgot that map actually gives you the value http://jsfiddle.net/Zg2F6/5/
[07:46:08] <Mattias> Nice
[07:46:09] <horrror> I have a set of divs that their sizes (different classes) changes accordingly (to each other). I want that the user will be able to edit each of the div sizes. I thought of using jquery.resizable but I need it to be resized to a specific  class and not specific width parameter. any ideas? thought of using addClass with animation but then I don't have the resizable div interactive arrows
[07:46:54] <Mattias> Cork, that data-key really made things much simpler :)
[07:47:09] <Mattias> Got a lot to code to rewrite now ;)
[07:47:11] <Cork> ya, attribute driven js is nice
[07:47:12] <Mattias> lot of code'
[07:47:39] <Cork> Mattias: remember to always add data- infront of generic data you add to your elements though
[07:47:49] <teeceepee> how do I remove duplicate objects from an array in jquery
[07:47:51] <Cork> so it doens't conflict with standard attibutes
[07:49:37] <Cork> teeceepee: $.grep(arr, function(v) { return !$.inArray(v, arr); })
[07:50:06] <Cork> actually to speed it up do
[07:50:18] <Cork> teeceepee: $.grep(arr, function(v, i) { return !$.inArray(v, arr, i+1); })
[07:50:37] <teeceepee> Cork what does that do ?
[07:50:43] <Cork> ?.inarray
[07:50:43] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[07:51:01] <Cork> damn forgot that part
[07:51:08] <Cork> teeceepee: $.grep(arr, function(v, i) { return $.inArray(v, arr, i+1) == -1; })
[07:51:22] <teeceepee> returns a boolean ?
[07:51:38] <Cork> the combination will filter out duplicates
[07:51:55] <Cork> grep grabs values where the test function returns true
[07:52:04] <Cork> and inarray returns -1 if it isn't in the array
[07:52:10] <Cork> the i is to not test already tested values
[07:52:41] <Cork> (or it self actually)
[07:53:51] <YammYcoding>  guys, I have jquery in <head>, function defined in footer, and in <body> a $(document).ready( function() {}.  Why still $ is not defined yet?
[07:53:56] <teeceepee> and are will be the clean one ?
[07:54:08] <teeceepee> arr*
[07:54:23] <Cork> YammYcoding: does the script load?
[07:54:32] <YammYcoding> yes
[07:54:37] <Cork> teeceepee: no the return value will be the clean one
[07:54:44] <YammYcoding> other jquery stuff works normally
[07:54:45] <Cork> $.grep will return the clean array
[07:55:05] <Cork> YammYcoding: are you using noConflict?
[07:55:18] <YammYcoding> what is it?
[07:55:23] <Cork> ?.noConflict
[07:55:23] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[07:56:43] <YammYcoding> i can replace by jQuery right? i tried that and still says it's not defined
[07:57:28] <teeceepee> Cork: doest work, its not a native object
[07:57:35] <Cork> would have to see the code to tell what's going on then (but i'm leaving in a moment)
[07:57:40] <teeceepee> its an an object like {}
[07:58:04] <Cork> teeceepee: uh
[07:58:09] <teeceepee> one min
[07:58:14] <Cork> oook, i missed what you asked
[07:58:14] * teeceepee pulls hair
[07:58:21] <Cork> teeceepee: you can't compare objects
[07:58:28] <teeceepee> yeah
[07:58:34] <teeceepee> cos they are not hashable
[07:58:35] <Cork> every separate copy of an object will always valuate to uniq
[07:58:36] <teeceepee> :)
[07:58:52] <Cork> you would have to loop the content of the object to check if they arn't the same
[08:01:56] <YammYcoding> i had the function definition inside a documentready. when i removed that, the call from <body> worked. Can anyone explain me what's with that load order that i'm not getting?
[08:02:32] <YammYcoding> i have jquery in <head>, function definition in <footer>, and function call in <body>.
[08:03:13] <YammYcoding> why the function call inside document.ready not worked? and why it worked outside?
[08:11:03] <BillCriswell> YammYcoding: Is your <footer> inside <body>? it should be
[08:11:22] <YammYcoding> it is right before </body>
[08:15:08] <BillCriswell> YammYcoding: Try putting your code here: jsfiddle.net
[08:15:22] <YammYcoding> can i show you the site?
[08:15:28] <BillCriswell> That'll do as well.
[08:50:44] <YammYcoding> BillCriswell thank youuuuuuu =D

[09:23:59] <wcwrel> i want to add a blur event, and then remove it after it fires, is this how i would do it: $ipt.blur(function(){
[09:24:00] <wcwrel> glbSaveAllViaAjax();
[09:24:00] <wcwrel> $(this).off('blur');});
[09:24:24] <TeraJL> is there any way to auto add a value to all ajax requests?
[09:25:52] <EdwardIII> indeed there sort of is heh
[09:25:53] <wcwrel> I want to remove all blur events, then add a blur event that saves the value then removes the blur event that was added, will this work: http://paste.ee/r/duoOo
[09:25:58] <EdwardIII> 1 sec
[09:27:47] <EdwardIII> wcwrel: here's an example that appends a CSRF token to the header of every ajax request: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/5967794
[09:27:52] <EdwardIII> sorry, not for you wcwrel
[09:27:59] <EdwardIII> TeraJL: here's an example that appends a CSRF token to the header of every ajax request: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/5967794
[09:28:03] <EdwardIII> TeraJL: you could use that as a starting point
[09:28:15] <TeraJL> thanks EdwardIII
[09:28:45] <andrewSC> have any of you ever seen: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[09:28:52] <andrewSC> on line 1 of jquery.js?
[09:29:03] <andrewSC> you can assume this isn't modified in any way
[09:29:15] <andrewSC> and it didn't have a problem locally
[09:29:42] <andrewSC> wait nvm
[09:29:53] <andrewSC> this is a bad loc pointer
[09:31:33] <TeraJL> EdwardIII: the csrfSafeMethod and sameOrigin is just some function testing the settings and origin? or is something from jquery/browser?
[09:32:30] <EdwardIII> TeraJL: they are, but the bit you'll be interested in is ajaxSetup and beforeSend
[10:21:32] <mezo_> Hey guys! I'm writing my first plugin where you do $(".selector").tooltip();, and then this items have tooltips. But I don't know how to handle if new items are added to site after I call $(".selector").tooltip()?
[10:29:43] <mezo_> Hey guys! I'm writing my first plugin where you do $(".selector").tooltip();, and then this items have tooltips. But I don't know how to handle if new items are added to site after I call $(".selector").tooltip()?
[10:30:26] <BillCriswell> mezo_: It would typically be up to the programmer to run the plugin again after new content is added.
[10:30:43] <BillCriswell> It appears there are ways to handle it automatically, but browser support seems slim.
[10:31:06] <BillCriswell> mezo_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6781661/jquery-how-to-call-a-jquery-plugin-function-on-an-element-that-hasnt-yet-been has some useful information.
[10:32:11] <BillCriswell> mezo_: I'd also take a look thought this, some useful information on how to keep it from applying the plugin to the same element twice. http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[10:32:53] <BillCriswell> take a look through*
[10:52:25] <gho5tjr> t
[10:54:08] <mezo_> Is there any option when element is added to a page to trigger a function? I've tried $(".element").ready(fn), but it's called only once, at page load... I want it to be called everytime new .element is added to a page
[11:09:20] <mklappstuhl> I'm loading a few JS files here: http://imgur.com/UShredc and get a "Reference Error $ is not defined" in admin_dropdown.js
[11:09:56] <mklappstuhl> funnily search.js and admin_dropdown.js start with the same $(function () {}) stuff and I don't get an error in the search.js file
[11:10:06] <mklappstuhl> any idea how sth like this can happen?
[11:11:50] <mklappstuhl> jquery itself is loaded before these files
[11:12:55] <gho5tjr> is there a self invoking function in admin_dropdown.js that is expecting something to be passed as "$" and you aren't passing it anything?
[11:15:01] <mklappstuhl> No there is only one $('#bla').click(fn... ) kind of thing in there
[11:15:06] <shoky> mklappstuhl: what do you get when you type $ in the console
[11:15:31] <mklappstuhl> function (a,b){return new p.fn.init(a,b,c)}
[11:15:49] <thaifood> hi
[11:16:15] <mklappstuhl> gho5tjr, shoky: ^
[11:16:38] <shoky> mklappstuhl: link to your site, or pastebin those 2 js files and your html
[11:17:02] <thaifood> Is there a jquery input mask for dotted notation IP addresses ?
[11:18:09] <gho5tjr> thaifood: if you still haven't found one maybe it's time to learn rejex
[11:18:11] <gho5tjr> *regex
[11:18:33] <thaifood> i don't think regex will manipulate the placeholder
[11:18:59] <thaifood> I learn regex every year and forget it just as quickly
[11:19:02] <gho5tjr> the placeholder?
[11:19:10] <thaifood> ___.___.___.___
[11:19:13] <gho5tjr> that's not exactly a mask then
[11:19:14] <mklappstuhl> shoky: https://gist.github.com/mklappstuhl/2134fe29fc99c3c6ec8e
[11:19:21] <gho5tjr> what does a placeholder have to do with a mask
[11:19:27] <BillCriswell> Morse code?
[11:19:36] <thaifood> it's a visual indicator of what where you can type
[11:19:59] <gho5tjr> I don't think masks use the native placeholders for that
[11:20:10] <thaifood> that's right they don't
[11:20:29] <gho5tjr> ok then
[11:20:43] <thaifood> you're welcome
[11:20:55] <gho5tjr> no you're welcome
[11:21:00] <thaifood> no i'm not
[11:21:09] <thaifood> YOU ARE WELCOME
[11:21:17] <mklappstuhl> shoky: added the bottom part of the html to the gist
[11:21:22] <BillCriswell> You're both welcome.
[11:21:27] <thaifood> hehe
[11:21:30] <ryanneufeld> thaifood: stop giving away your welcome
[11:21:36] <gho5tjr> you really need someone to build you something that puts a div with the text of ___.___.___.___ for you
[11:21:37] <thaifood> damn, tricked me again
[11:21:44] <NoiseEee> is nickserv online for some of you?
[11:21:52] <gho5tjr> freenode is having issues
[11:22:14] <thaifood> gho5tjr,  no, i need it to mask it to only allow valid chars too
[11:22:20] <gho5tjr> REGEX
[11:22:21] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Not for me.
[11:22:22] <gho5tjr> good day sir
[11:22:29] <NoiseEee> thanks BillCriswell
[11:22:45] <thaifood> regex is not a flower to be picked but a mountain to be climbed
[11:22:57] <BillCriswell> Why are you being so nice to mountains?
[11:23:01] <thaifood> and if you don't climb mountains often it's a waste of time
[11:23:02] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: no problem!
[11:23:03] <gho5tjr> beautiful
[11:23:08] <gho5tjr> not really

[11:23:12] <gho5tjr> s
[11:23:14] <shoky> mklappstuhl: donno.. need to see it live, then
[11:23:18] <gho5tjr> and then refresh the syntax when needed
[11:23:44] <mklappstuhl> shoky: wierd, isn't it? live isn't possible right now :/
[11:24:06] <BillCriswell> krizoek: You would just need $(function(){ revrefresh(); });
[11:24:20] <thaifood> pray for me, i have to switch from fedora 18 to win7 tomorrow for good...  Can't wait to see how to change my workflow over.  ack
[11:24:24] <BillCriswell> $(document).ready( revrefresh ); would work as well.
[11:24:41] <BillCriswell> thaifood: Sounds... irresponsible haha.
[11:24:45] <gho5tjr> why do people prefer $(function(){ .. });
[11:24:49] <gho5tjr> is it cause you look smarter?
[11:24:54] <thaifood> BillCriswell,  no it's government !!!
[11:25:02] <BillCriswell> gho5tjr: Shorter.
[11:25:14] <thaifood> They are here to help
[11:25:22] <mklappstuhl> shoky: just replaced everything within the ready with an alert and it workd
[11:25:23] <BillCriswell> But you're right. I feel my IQ points jump like.. 5 points every time I use it.
[11:25:36] <Brutick> Historically didn't more lines of javascript inhibit page load performance?
[11:25:42] <krizoek> it doesnt seem to load the file
[11:25:46] <Brutick> I swear I read that somewhere
[11:25:53] <gho5tjr> well of course
[11:25:58] <BillCriswell> Brutick: It depends what those lines are doing I'm sure.
[11:26:09] <gho5tjr> that is why we have minimization
[11:26:19] <shoky> mklappstuhl: which line were you getting the error on
[11:26:34] <BillCriswell> krizoek: Is there an error of any kind? Are you sure that url is outputting something?
[11:26:50] <krizoek> yes, it will output something indeed
[11:27:25] <mklappstuhl> first
[11:27:35] <mklappstuhl> the error is in the gist as well
[11:27:38] <mklappstuhl> shoky: &
[11:27:40] <guzzlefry_dev> hello
[11:27:45] <shoky> mklappstuhl: btw you don't need the ready stuff if you put your scripts at the end of the body like that
[11:28:09] <mklappstuhl> shoky: good to know, thank you!
[11:28:16] <BillCriswell> krizoek: I'm not sure if load() will bail on an error... so is an error header being sent or something? There's just a lot of shit that can go wrong without all the details.
[11:28:31] <krizoek> no, i dont get any errors either
[11:28:35] <guzzlefry_dev> I'm having some trouble getting an input element to focus after the modal login box is shown.
[11:28:45] <BillCriswell> krizoek: Is it up somewhere?
[11:28:56] <krizoek> its local
[11:29:04] <krizoek> but let me put it up somewhere
[11:29:26] <mklappstuhl> shoky: oddly enough the alert is showed while the ready stuff throws the referenced error :D
[11:29:28] <BillCriswell> Are you using a server or just running off of file://///////// or whatever
[11:30:27] <shoky> mklappstuhl: odd when you say it, yes. donno if it'd be that odd if we could actually see it ;P
[11:30:39] <guzzlefry_dev> http://www.bpaste.net/show/GwWOYj0dGAgrgytlU1iQ/ Code is there.
[11:31:21] <mklappstuhl> shoky: I know what you mean haha, but I'm fine for now, I'll just continue and figure out what actually happens later, stuff works but throws and effect less error :D
[11:31:50] <shoky> g'luck
[11:34:56] <Brutick> After hearing about freenode being DDoS'ed currently, I keep remembering that there's really nothing on here that's worth taking down. It's so weird that we're a target right now.

[11:42:40] <krizoek> http://bibleway.us/?revbrowser&listbk=GEN&b=4 <- i put up what im working with here also; i load the jquery in the head. but the rest of javascript code is at the bottom of the page
[11:43:17] <BillCriswell> krizoek: SyntaxError
[11:43:43] <eddiemonge> krizoek: why do you include it at the top?
[11:43:51] <krizoek> where is the syntax error?
[11:43:52] <eddiemonge> and why not update to a new version?
[11:44:04] <BillCriswell> krizoek: $(document).ready($(function(){ revrefresh(); }););
[11:44:07] <krizoek> i dont follow the updates all the time
[11:44:59] <krizoek> i updated that part of the code now
[11:45:00] <BillCriswell> $(function(){ revrefresh(); }); is probably what you want.
[11:45:49] <eddiemonge> i wonder if $(revrefresh) would work ...
[11:46:05] <BillCriswell> krizoek: http://bibleway.us/inc/revdatadisp.php?revbrowser&listbk=GEN&b=4 does not exist.
[11:46:14] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Try it you wild man!
[11:46:30] <BillCriswell> Just be careful. Wear gloves.
[11:46:35] <eddiemonge> $(document).ready(revrefresh) would be the shortcut? i just dont know
[11:46:47] <eddiemonge> *shortcut target
[11:47:13] <krizoek> it does exist, it just dont give out headers and html start tags..
[11:47:13] <krizoek> you have to check with wget http://bibleway.us/inc/revdatadisp.php?revbrowser&listbk=GEN&b=4
[11:48:08] <eddiemonge> krizoek: if the browser cant hit it, then it doesnt exist
[11:48:52] <krizoek> is thats whats happening now?, is there something i could output for to make it "existing"?
[11:50:26] <krizoek> <hello, im here>
[11:50:43] <eddiemonge> krizoek: how are you outputting that code now?
[11:50:52] <BillCriswell> krizoek: I'm not familiar enough with what you're trying to do to be useful.
[11:51:14] <krizoek> i have a div inside the table <tr><td> that i wish to fill more things unto the table with
[11:51:31] <eddiemonge> i dont really understand how its working with wget but not directly in a browser
[11:52:36] <eddiemonge> also probably not good to leave this up: http://bibleway.us/inc/
[11:52:37] <BillCriswell> $('table tr td:eq(0)').load('urlthatoutputsstuff.php')
[11:52:56] <BillCriswell> Not enough nudity in phpinf().
[11:53:01] <BillCriswell> phpinfo()
[11:53:19] <krizoek> its a opensourced project, so people could find out things anyways
[11:53:48] <NoiseEee> krizoek: it still identifies things about your server that are best left unknown
[11:56:41] <BillCriswell> I love how 80's the Zend Engine 2 logo is.
[11:56:49] <BillCriswell> We need those times again.
[11:57:53] <krizoek> its just a standard installation, if someone want to hack it, or would bother to make time for it; they can do so. i have everything backed up anyways
[12:03:30] <eddiemonge> but do you want to spend the time backing up and then securing it?
[12:05:06] <krizoek> i have always imagined someone accessing everything i have connected up with the internet, so i have made other ways for to control materials
[12:06:08] <eddiemonge> or lets say someone puts something on the site. you wouldnt know unless you went through the source to find it
[12:06:39] <krizoek> then it would appear in git when i publish the new copies
[12:07:14] <krizoek> *github
[12:07:32] <BillCriswell> Ever see the talk Torvalds does on git? He tears CVS a new butt hole.
[12:08:02] <krizoek> what do you mean?
[12:08:02] <jwmann> I have a jQuery script that uses an on.('click') but events only trigger on the second click after a fresh page load. This doesn't happen when sandboxing the script and elements by themselves. Would anybody know of a cause for this?
[12:08:42] <BillCriswell> krizoek: Just hearing him dismantle CVS was interesting.. seems like when he dislikes something he REALLY dislikes something. Just thought it was interesting.
[12:09:18] <BillCriswell> jwmann: There could be some element you're clicking inside the element that stops propagation?
[12:09:46] <jwmann> BillCriswell: What would it look like?
[12:10:15] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:10:36] <BillCriswell> So if that's on a parent and it runs it'll prevent the click from bubbling up.
[12:11:09] <BillCriswell> but since it works after one click I'd look to see if you have some .one('click') or something along those lines.
[12:12:12] <krizoek> whats important is the bible content, and i have made many features for to check if someone have been doing something funny with it
[12:12:38] <krizoek> one never knows what the devils will be up to
[12:12:44] <jwmann> BillCriswell: I've isolated the script and elements and the problem disappears, the only other JS included in the page is the jquery lib
[12:12:59] <jwmann> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/FG23B/

[12:19:11] <boytoy> Hi, I'm trying to make it possible to iScroll through YouTube embeds in cases where the gesture starts on the videos themselves: http://jsbin.com/avujix/24
[12:19:14] <boytoy> But this whole "scrollable layer" approach seems impossible due to JavaScript's same origin policy. Let me just get this straight - are there *ABSOLUTELY* no workarounds?
[12:19:51] <boytoy> (before I begin on a jsbin that grabs thumbnails of the videos and then open them in popups)
[12:21:31] <eddiemonge> boytoy: i still dont understand your problem
[12:21:49] <boytoy> eddiemonge: which part?
[12:22:33] <boytoy> eddiemonge: this is for mobile incase i forgot to mention
[12:23:01] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Okay, ready to roll
[12:23:06] <jwmann> I'll pm you address
[12:23:12] <BillCriswell> Okies.
[12:23:24] <eddiemonge> boytoy: iscroll, why you are hitting sop, scrollable layer
[12:23:56] <boytoy> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[12:24:23] <eddiemonge> i mean i dont understand what you are doing and how all that affects you
[12:24:53] <krizoek> the devil is a little more deceptive than being open with it, im sure BillCriswell :)
[12:25:33] <BillCriswell> I like Satan from The Mysterious Stranger.
[12:26:10] <boytoy> eddiemonge: well i got a mobile page with a bunch of youtube, vimeo etc. embeds. im using iscroll since many old/current mobile browsers dont have scrolling. so iscroll works fine unless you try to begin the scrolling on top of the youtubes, in which case youtube "hijacks" the scrolling
[12:26:39] <eddiemonge> dont have scrolling? name one
[12:27:13] <boytoy> eddiemonge: lots man like android 2.x
[12:27:19] <boytoy> ios4
[12:27:30] <eddiemonge> those can scroll
[12:27:37] <eddiemonge> otherwise the web wouldnt work

[12:28:09] <eddiemonge> lol
[12:28:40] <eddiemonge> do all my work for free and if the project succeeds, you might get pennies. those are always funny reads
[12:28:41] <krizoek> better a satanist than a catholic. like its prophecied. better cold than lukewarm
[12:29:13] <piklu> eddiemonge : before making conclusions one should hear the concept :)
[12:29:48] <boytoy> eddiemonge: i dont think they can
[12:30:10] <boytoy> eddiemonge: i mean not for custom divs etc.
[12:30:35] <eddiemonge> piklu: im sure its the same as the thousands of similiar offers out there.
[12:30:37] <boytoy> and certainly not with the smoothness, bouncing, zooming etc. of native app scrolling
[12:31:41] <piklu> eddiemonge: no
[12:31:49] <eddiemonge> piklu: if your idea really was commercially viable, then you would find a budget to hire someone at a normal wage
[12:31:50] <BillCriswell> krizoek: I'm an atheist myself. I just like Satan in that story. I admire his stance in the bible as well... Probably not the best place to talk about this though haha.

[12:32:17] <eddiemonge> boytoy: maybe you need to adjust your ui then so you dont have overflow divs and the whole page just scrolls
[12:32:42] <piklu> eddiemonge: And think wisely, people have quality, if you just can't take risk of doing a private message, hear the offer details and than reject or select, if you can't invest 10 mins - what shall I say about everything, So I can't say about people's prejudice
[12:32:48] <krizoek> even the pope look up to the believers in atheism, because he knows they are better than he. they and the islamists, ... they all are honest about their place. being a open part against the Lord
[12:32:56] <boytoy> eddiemonge: i cant im using jquery mobile which is overflow all over the place hehe
[12:33:01] <worstadmin> However I dont understand the params its including
[12:33:05] <worstadmin> Or how I should respond
[12:33:16] <krizoek> active parties which is open about their place is good, because then we can see easily where such stand
[12:33:21] <boytoy> piklu: go ahead tell us about your concept
[12:33:52] <piklu> boy toy : i am not willing to open it in a IRC, those interested can discuss in pm and respect the privacy. I hope this is fair.
[12:33:59] <eddiemonge> boytoy: not really. what eidget are you using?
[12:34:40] <eddiemonge> s/eidget/widget/
[12:35:41] <boytoy> eddiemonge: just toolbars and panel

[12:39:30] <groundup> https://gist.github.com/joshuaadickerson/20997412b3e2d90fd4e6 I am trying to create a simple jQuery navigation but it keeps hiding the slides after I click the nav link. It shows them and then it goes away
[12:40:52] <boytoy> eddiemonge: panel does i think
[12:41:40] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: the best way is by not doing it
[12:41:45] <eddiemonge> boytoy: not that i can see
[12:45:18] <boytoy> eddiemonge: well http://jsbin.com/odukon/2/edit i dont see how that could work on older mobile browsers without iscroll
[12:45:49] <boytoy> eddiemonge: but back to the point - even with default scrolling, wouldnt youtube videos still hijack scroll gestures?
[12:46:20] <boytoy> i would love to ditch iscroll but people keep telling me the world is not ready
[12:46:53] <renaud_> Hi all, I got a huge form which is made by several panel. My goal is to show the first panel at the user, when he fullfills the panel the second one appears. It works but now I want to allow user to edit the data. And the form appears with only one panel. I tried to use $(document).ready and call js function to check my form and display all panel but it does not work.http://jsfiddle.net/6xTe7/
[12:47:59] <boytoy> eddiemonge: so at http://jsbin.com/avujix/24 i added a layer on top of youtube videos to prevent that, and then to pass down any clicks from the top layer to the underlying youtubes - but this same origin policy seems to prevent that from happening so
[12:51:20] <kamo> ¬pr14SaTHEwU
[12:51:44] <boytoy> piklu_: yo tell us about your concept!
[12:51:45] <eddiemonge> groundup: still there?
[12:51:53] <jedimind> lol boytoy
[12:52:02] <kamo> Everything is working
[12:52:16] <kamo> I think computer is freazing up
[12:52:33] <kamo> See you all later
[12:55:02] <eddiemonge> groundup: not the best but works: http://jsfiddle.net/e2PAn/
[12:58:18] <eddiemonge> boytoy: oh. yeah i would not embed youtube like that. put the thumbnail as a link to the video. most mobile devices will popup their youtube player anyway right?
[13:00:52] <eddiemonge> boytoy: or maybe use https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Loading_a_Video_Player
[13:09:10] <culh> Is there a difference to functions encapsulated in ()? E.g.: (function <funcName>() { (...) })();

[13:17:30] <jwmann> I have a jQuery script that uses an on.('click') but events only trigger on the second click after a fresh page load. This doesn't happen when sandboxing the script and elements by themselves. Would anybody know of a cause for this? (I can PM you a live dev version of the website)
[13:17:41] <boytoy> eddiemonge: cool, will do thanks
[13:17:41] <piklu> eddiemonge: pm?
[13:20:59] <trinode> what's the difference between currentTarget and target?
[13:21:22] <trinode> I've got an on(click,classname)
[13:21:38] <trinode> and set the class on some li's
[13:21:47] <trinode> that contain some stuff
[13:21:52] <trinode> header paragraph
[13:22:02] <trinode> and target is coming back as those sub elements
[13:23:30] <pachet> trinode that's expected behavior
[13:23:37] <pachet> event.target is the element where the event originated
[13:23:52] <pachet> event.currentTarget is the element you assigned a handler to, that caught the event, and may or may not be the originating element
[13:23:53] <trinode> is currentTarget what I want then?
[13:24:14] <trinode> ok, thanks pachet
[13:24:18] <pachet> if you're just looking to get the li back, then yeah
[13:24:45] <trinode> I attached data to the li, so I was confused when it was randomly coming back as undefined
[13:24:56] <trinode> (i guess depending on where I clicked)
[13:48:33] <skypce> hello all
[13:48:40] <skypce> can you helpme with this please
[13:48:41] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/hjEwp/
[13:48:55] <skypce> what is wrong with this?
[13:49:24] <jedimind> im no expert but it doesnt have any html
[13:49:27] <jedimind> that might be a part of it
[13:49:36] <gho5tjr> I am an expert and I think that is a part too
[13:49:49] <gho5tjr> also TweenLite is not defined
[13:50:40] <skypce> thanks gho5tjr
[13:52:12] <squirkle> Does anyone know of a lightweight ajax library that shares the API of $.ajax()?
[13:59:39] <guzzlefry_dev> Does anyone have a graceful fix for the IE8 bug in which hidden forms don't get the default "submit on enter press" event binded to them?
[14:03:16] <skypce> guys can you helpme to find the error please :S
[14:03:16] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/B5Vyw/
[14:07:35] <guzzlefry_dev> Given $this, how can I find the closest parent that's a form?
[14:08:30] <CWSpear> guzzlefry_dev $this.closest('form')
[14:08:54] <diminoten> anyone know of an example of a working form validator?
[14:08:54] <CWSpear> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:09:00] <guzzlefry_dev> awesome, thank you
[14:10:49] <mathi> hi
[14:11:37] <mathi> how can I have the position of the element clicked ? E.g. $('#thumbs img').click(function() {   =>   alert 3 if this is the third <img> element in #thumbs
[14:12:25] <shoky> ?index
[14:12:25] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[14:12:54] <shoky> mathi ^
[14:13:00] <mathi> awesome
[14:13:01] <mathi> thanks!!!
[14:15:12] <mathi> shoky, and how to do get the n-th element ? e.g. $('#images img')   <= get the 2d img ?
[14:15:35] <shoky> ?eq
[14:15:35] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:16:00] <CWSpear> that's cool
[14:16:04] <CWSpear> ?closest
[14:16:05] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:16:10] <CWSpear> neato
[14:16:17] <CWSpear> Thanks bot-t!
[14:16:17] * bot-t sighs
[14:16:18] <guzzlefry_dev> Is there any reliable way to test for IE8?
[14:18:33] <diminoten> anyway I duno if my question got through, is there a jsfiddle out there showing an example of validate configuration?
[14:20:21] <BillCris_> diminoten: Depends on the plugin doing the validations I'd imagine.
[14:20:34] <diminoten> no plugin, I'd like to go in raw
[14:20:43] <diminoten> oh wait
[14:20:59] <diminoten> great point, I thought I was reading jquery docs, I'm actually reading a plugin dc
[14:21:02] <diminoten> *doc, even
[14:21:52] <diminoten> so jquery doesn't have validation support out of the box?  that's okay I'm just wondering
[14:22:21] <shoky> no
[14:22:45] <diminoten> any recommended plugins then?
[14:23:41] <shoky> http://jqueryvalidation.org/  is a popular one
[14:33:38] <mercuryrising> hey, i'm trying to make a jquery slider that has it's properties change as things happen, I can set the minimum, max, and value, but when it try to set the step size it throws an error -> Error: no such method 'step' for slider widget instance, with this line: $('#slider').slider('step', 20), what gives?
[14:36:08] <Blade_> mercuryrising: http://jqueryui.com/slider/ your using this?
[14:36:24] <mercuryrising> yeah

[14:38:11] <Blade_> mercuryrising: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-step
[14:38:13] <mercuryrising> ah, i may have been wrong with the other ones working, it looks like only the value can be set (not the minimum or maximum either)
[14:38:32] <mercuryrising> ah awesome
[14:38:59] <mercuryrising> very cool, that works great, thanks Blade_!
[14:39:00] <Blade_>  $('#slider').slider( "option", "step", 20 );
[14:39:13] <Blade_> see if that works for ya, or the other option think they both do the same!
[14:39:42] <Blade_> or yeah read that it should help
[14:39:53] <Blade_> let me know if you need anymore help mercuryrising: !

[14:43:46] <Tomashe1> hey guys , i have some simple target="_blank" on some links but from some reason its just ignore them. anyone have any idea what can couse that , maybe jquery or something?
[14:44:03] <Blade_> hmm
[14:44:11] <Blade_> so you want the link to open in a new window/tab ?
[14:44:16] <Tomashe1> yes
[14:44:45] <Tomashe1> but i have no idea why its just ignoring my html target attribute
[14:45:01] <Blade_> Give me a minute, I'll give you an alternative to try I guess.
[14:46:06] <Blade_> new window or tab
[14:46:24] <Tomashe1> tab\
[14:46:31] <Tomashe1> \i tried "new" aswell
[14:46:56] <shoky> Tomashe1: it could be some code is handling the clicks and preventing the default action.. got a link to your site?
[14:47:07] <Blade_> try target="_new"
[14:47:19] <Blade_> and yeah thats true too
[14:47:30] <Blade_> does it take you to the link?
[14:47:36] <Blade_> without opening a new tab?
[14:47:54] <Tomashe1> sorry
[14:47:57] <Tomashe1> it was my mistake
[14:48:07] <Tomashe1> i mistakly did pjax on the entire "a"
[14:48:15] <Blade_> >.> yep
[14:48:16] <shoky> yeh
[14:48:17] <Tomashe1> that was cause that, now its working
[14:48:20] <Blade_> okay
[14:48:23] <Blade_> gl with your work
[14:48:31] <Tomashe1> thanks buddy
[14:48:42] <Tomashe1> those nights work are always bad business :) haha
[14:49:10] <Blade_> I bet man
[14:50:44] <Blade_> afk.
[14:52:12] <goddard> how can i have 2 instances of jquery running?
[14:52:18] <goddard> 2 different versions
[14:52:43] <s5fs> goddard: why would you want to do that, just curious
[14:53:00] <Blade_> probably cause one of his features works on the old and not the new idk though.
[14:54:35] <otahak> aaah
[14:54:50] <scotdb> Anyone used the jquery.datatables.editable popup edit functionality and know what format the update script needs to return ?
[14:55:16] <scotdb> (I can't find it in the docs anywhere)
[14:56:16] <otahak> hey guys. Im a bit of a n00b and Im unable to figure out $.get
[14:56:32] <wagtag> I'm trying to create a parallax like effect where a container background image scrolls with the page. Works great in all browsers except for IE where it is really jittery. Here is a working demo http://jsfiddle.net/v9VFS/
[14:58:07] <shoky> otahak: then read the docs, and ask your question
[14:58:17] <otahak> I am reading the docs.
[14:58:26] <otahak> thats why Im here - I followed them as best as I could figure to lol
[14:58:30] <otahak> http://pastie.org/8129360
[14:58:49] <shoky> eh
[14:59:13] <Blade_> otahak: I know how to use get..I just used it let me read up tho incase someone already answered
[14:59:39] <shoky> otahak: that Access-control-Allow-Origin  header is for the server to put, not the client
[15:00:02] <otahak> oh. I thought I was supposed to be sending that to the server in order to get past an access control error
[15:00:08] <shoky> otahak: and function(data),  is not proper javascript..
[15:00:12] <shoky> you need to learn javascript first
[15:00:17] <otahak> I do.
[15:00:22] <shoky> ?learn
[15:00:22] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:00:27] <otahak> yeah
[15:00:47] <otahak> I never sat down to learn it. I've only got functional knowledge of it from canabilizing code and what little PHP I know
[15:00:47] <Blade_> ill edit your pastebin
[15:00:49] <Blade_> and see if I can fix
[15:02:07] <otahak> ty!
[15:02:19] <shoky> otahak then you won't get very far
[15:02:48] <otahak> its not that I dont want to / plan to learn.. but right now Im tasked with accomplishing something lol.
[15:03:06] <otahak> but thanks for your support all the same shoky :)
[15:03:19] <Blade_> give me a bit
[15:03:28] <otahak> take your time. Im reading tutorials :P
[15:04:22] <shoky> otahak: and about the header, no, you dont send it to the server, the server sends it to you. otherwise the browser will complain that it's a cross-domain request
[15:05:00] <leo-the-manic> I am using the jQueryUI autocomplete combobox. I want to *remove* all the jQuerUI themeing on it, but I want to keep the themeing of the little autocomplete menu that pops up. How can I stop the hover/active UI classes from being applied?
[15:05:23] <leo-the-manic> I don't want to delete the class definitions since elsewhere I use datepicker, etc. and for those widgets, the themeing is fine the way it is
[15:07:52] <Blade_> data('Access-control-Allow-Origin','*')
[15:07:54] <Blade_> your putting that in the data field
[15:07:58] <Blade_> whats that for?
[15:08:07] <shoky> Blade_ it shouldn't be there at all
[15:08:20] <Blade_> thats why im asking
[15:08:23] <shoky> that's a server-side header
[15:08:29] <shoky> he has no idea what he's doing, that's why it's there
[15:08:33] <otahak> sorry took a call
[15:08:39] <otahak> and yeah - shoky is right
[15:08:41] <otahak> Im kinda clueless here.
[15:08:52] <Blade_> yeah http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_get.asp you have that in the data row which is invalid
[15:08:54] <otahak> Never worked with API's or this advanced type of JQ
[15:09:03] <Blade_> scroll down for Syntax
[15:09:24] <otahak> in my defense - i was having access problems, so I was told I had to send a custom header to the server, which I thought was done that way lol
[15:11:06] <Blade_> so what are you trying to do then?
[15:11:10] <otahak> I was originally using $.getJSON which I had done successfully with a different API.. but google is more secure. I'm trying to simply make a successful API call right now.
[15:11:28] <otahak> and show the returned data in console.log
[15:11:54] <otahak> (and again guys - i get the frustration. I appreciate you taking the time to help me. I can promise I wont always be this clueless with JS lol)
[15:12:39] <Blade_> http://pastebin.com/wVMjsE9s
[15:12:42] <Blade_> you coudl try that...
[15:12:47] <Blade_> im not familiar with the console.log though
[15:12:52] <Blade_> it should basically
[15:12:57] <Blade_> output what it finds in the URL you put in
[15:13:03] <Blade_> into the console log I guess
[15:13:10] <otahak> hmmm
[15:13:17] <otahak> so then its just my lack of syntax understanding
[15:13:19] <otahak> haha
[15:13:30] <shoky> otahak: first thing to do is see what google's API docs say for this API.
[15:13:44] <Blade_> yeah
[15:14:03] <Blade_> {    "debug_info" : [],    "html_attributions" : [],    "results" : [],    "status" : "REQUEST_DENIED" }
[15:14:04] <otahak> now Im back to square 1. "Origin http://daddydayz.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. "
[15:14:04] <Blade_> thats what I get
[15:14:11] <leo-the-manic> Can I override addClass on an element to reject certain classes, or something cool like that?
[15:14:17] <Blade_> hmm
[15:14:18] <Blade_> okay ohldon
[15:15:22] <Blade_> http://pastebin.com/fkfKupbh
[15:15:23] <Blade_> what about that?
[15:16:04] <Blade_> holdon
[15:16:06] <Blade_> I made an error
[15:16:38] <shoky> otahak: i'd use their JS api  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places
[15:17:21] <otahak> ouh.. fun.
[15:17:29] <Blade_> http://pastebin.com/gLzRV9zy
[15:17:34] <Blade_> what does that do for ya?
[15:18:14] <otahak> access error, blade_
[15:18:30] <Blade_> whats the error say though
[15:18:45] <otahak> XMLHttpRequest cannot load [api url]
[15:19:02] <otahak> [domain]is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[15:20:19] <Blade_> okay
[15:20:52] <Blade_> yeah
[15:20:56] <Blade_> you have to use their API I think
[15:20:59] <Blade_> I can try to help though
[15:21:00] <Sna4x8> otahak: You can't use $.get/etc for that afaik.  You can only use jsonp cross-domain.
[15:21:09] <shoky> they don't support jsonp
[15:21:23] <Sna4x8> No they don't.
[15:21:26] <otahak> dratz.
[15:21:58] <Blade_> someone linked this already https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places read that
[15:22:02] <Sna4x8> At any rate (without fully reading the google docs there) if I recall, APIs that require a key only work from your domain.
[15:22:19] <Sna4x8> Meaning that you cannot make the request from the client.
[15:22:34] <Sna4x8> I'm just going off the fact that you have a 'key' parameter in there.
[15:22:44] <otahak> thats what the docs said...
[15:23:04] <Blade_> otahak
[15:23:07] <Blade_> what docs are you refering to?
[15:23:08] <otahak> https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/search#PlaceSearchRequests
[15:23:26] <shoky> the first thing that page says is: Looking to use this service in a JavaScript application? Check out the Places Library of the Google Maps API v3.
[15:23:31] <shoky> the link i gave.
[15:23:37] <otahak> fuck.
[15:23:53] <otahak> well then
[15:23:54] <shoky> fuck. you gotta use a convenient API for this
[15:23:57] <otahak> sorry to waste your time.
[15:24:18] <Sna4x8> lol.
[15:24:52] <Sna4x8> The example 'Nearby Places' code that Blade_ linked looks pretty easy to use.
[15:25:07] <otahak> i'll try that with the proper URL :P
[15:25:27] <otahak> I'll beef up on this doc and come back with questions if I cant find answers online :)
[15:25:34] <otahak> thanks and sorry again guys
[15:28:57] <otahak> one more question actually - can something like this be developed locally on xammp or do I have to use a real server?
[15:30:05] <Blade_> if you got internet connection why not?
[15:30:22] <Blade_> I havent read all of it though
[15:30:23] <Blade_> so im not positive
[15:30:43] <otahak> ty!
[15:31:30] <otahak> haha yayy
[15:31:34] <otahak> despite how little I know of JS
[15:31:34] <wagtag> Any ideas on how to make updating css positions on window scroll smoother in Internet Explorer? Works fine in all other browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/v9VFS/
[15:31:39] <otahak> using the proper API seems to be doing the trick haha
[15:33:10] <goddard> how can i have 2 instances of jquery running?
[15:33:11] <goddard> 2 different versions
[15:34:13] <otahak> goddard - as far as I know you can't. not on the same page.
[15:39:22] <goddard> otahak: can unload another javascript file some how?
[15:39:38] <goddard> im using a CMS and I just want to disable it with javascript on one page
[15:39:41] <otahak> well, im probably not the best guy to ask
[15:39:46] <otahak> but Id imagine in theory
[15:39:55] <otahak> if you only need one version of jquery for the first part of the script
[15:40:04] <otahak> you could unload it somehow and load the second version
[15:40:19] <otahak> (im a JS newb, so I really couldnt help you much. I just know this cos I already asked this question once lol)
[15:40:50] <otahak> but no - to my knowledge there's no way to have two jquery libs going at the same time
[15:41:03] <tw2113> why would you need 2 different jQuery versions?
[15:42:52] <goddard> tw2113: because the CMS requires it, but i use functionality not present in its version
[15:43:06] <tw2113> what cms requires it?
[15:44:46] <retran> an old version of some weird template you have in a CMS
[16:08:35] <Sna4x8> I have a series of $.ajax requests that I need to send them to the server in the same order they originate from the client, and only one should be sent at a time.  Is there a way I can queue ajax requests using deferred (or some other way)?
[16:09:34] <shoky> ?ajaxQueue
[16:09:34] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/

[16:11:56] <nodejsissuicide> Hello ALL
[16:12:00] <nodejsissuicide> :P
[16:15:45] <Sna4x8> Thanks shoky - looks pretty straight forward.
[16:15:48] <leo_31> i was fired recently. why did the boss ask me if i expected it and why does he and my colleagues still have me on skype?
[16:16:17] <shoky> because he was curious, and why not
[16:18:44] <tw2113> maybe they want to give you work they can't take on when it comes up
[16:19:26] <leo_31> but the did you expect it bit shocked me. i told him yes
[16:20:23] <tw2113> i think everyone is unless they know they're doing a crap job
[16:21:54] <worstadmin> Im using .ajax() with jsonp and its hitting my dest with params like jquery22321321312 and _34234234234324 (2013-07-10T19:18:53-04:00 INFO (6): a:6:{s:10:"controller";s:4:"link";s:6:"action";s:5:"index";s:6:"module";s:7:"default";s:4:"true";s:40:

[16:22:11] <worstadmin> Can anyone point me in the right direction of how to respond to these?
[16:22:26] <worstadmin> Thats a serialized getParams() above
[16:24:09] <tw2113> unserialize it?
[16:25:11] <mot0rola> If I have a plugin in a js file which takes in the name of a function as a parameter, how can I check if that function exists on my html page?
[16:28:22] <hugo_moss> search all your js files for that function
[16:28:41] <hugo_moss> do a find in chrome web developer tools under the resources tab
[16:28:55] <hugo_moss> and use that function name as a search query
[16:28:58] <mot0rola> but i want to do the check from within the plugin
[16:29:13] <myndzi> if (typeof fnName === 'function')
[16:29:18] <mot0rola> i know typeof and .isFunction
[16:29:30] <myndzi> then what's your question?
[16:29:47] <mot0rola> I am not sure if that works if I store the string of the function in a var
[16:29:49] <myndzi> if you don't want to test programmatically, and you don't want to test non-programmatically... o_O
[16:29:54] <myndzi> ah
[16:30:00] <myndzi> typeof window['functionName']
[16:30:12] <myndzi> unless of course the function is a method of something else
[16:30:21] <mot0rola> no it's just a plain old function
[16:30:30] <myndzi> then it should be a child of window i think
[16:30:39] <mot0rola> thanks myndzi I will check it out
[16:33:00] <mot0rola> thanks, worked like a charm
[16:33:29] <anew> i'm returning json result.array[52]

[17:30:34] <ValsiS> :(
[17:30:57] <ValsiS> i know :( it's not really a jquery problem, but i don;t know where to ask
[17:31:12] <CWSpear> what's the ?
[17:31:59] <CWSpear> ValsiS, can you rephrase the question? I'm not sure I understood.
[17:32:21] <KratosZero> He doesn't know English very well.
[17:32:41] <ValsiS> on first xhr request i recive  some data who will populate a table id
[17:33:03] <ValsiS> inside that data i will have some div *(who will be used on an bootstrap modal)
[17:33:15] <ValsiS> everything works ok on first request
[17:33:15] <CWSpear> what does that data look like?
[17:33:25] <ValsiS> html
[17:33:47] <CWSpear> Where ever you're putting the content, try something like $('.selector').html('').append(data);

[17:44:08] <Blade_> Hey
[17:45:26] <Blade_> If I have a table with the ID "table1" and I click in that table in a <td> tag, the click event.target.id is not "table1" why is this?
[17:46:06] <CWSpear> cuz it will be more specific
[17:46:34] <CWSpear> what is event.target (console.log it)
[17:47:59] <Blade_> I alerted it, Object HTML TABLE CELL ELEMENT
[17:48:27] <Blade_> so in that case, how can I get the tables id then without putting the id into each td tag
[17:48:30] <CWSpear> Blade_, yeah, so it's because you're clicking on the table cell (<td>)
[17:48:41] <Blade_> yeah ^^
[17:49:05] <Blade_> i'd have to get the parent id somehow
[17:49:08] <Blade_> I'll google it
[17:49:15] <CWSpear> try this: $(event.target).closest('table').attr('id')
[17:49:25] <CWSpear> !closest
[17:49:29] <CWSpear> nope
[17:49:34] <CWSpear> how do you do that cool bot-t thing?
[17:50:27] <CWSpear> ?closest
[17:50:28] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[17:50:56] <CWSpear> and depending on how you're binding the event, $(this) should work, too
[17:51:01] <Blade_> hmm
[17:51:02] <Blade_> alright
[17:51:05] <Blade_> ill give it a go!
[17:51:10] <CWSpear> $(this).closest('table') gets the table
[17:51:50] <Blade_> so then I'd just do .attr('id')
[17:51:53] <Blade_> sounds good
[17:52:51] <Blade_> $(e).closest('table').attr('id'); I got
[17:52:54] <Blade_> why isn't that workin
[17:53:24] <Blade_> e same as this
[17:53:26] <Blade_> tried both
[17:53:30] <Blade_> says undefined
[17:53:48] <CWSpear> where did you get e from? you were just using event
[17:54:07] <Blade_> I used event to specify the real name was e though
[17:54:17] <CWSpear> try e.target
[17:55:03] <Blade_> nah still undefined

[17:59:03] <CWSpear> I like you, bot-t
[17:59:41] <CWSpear> and yes, joe-c, I have a tiny bit of experience with it
[17:59:46] <joe-c> Okay. I'm using waypoints.js to fire events when a point of the page is reached. I'm using an offset as I have a sticky top menu. Works fine on the way down the page (offset 100, the height of the menu) but when I come back up it doesn't until 1px after the offset
[18:00:37] <joe-c> wait I'll build a fiddle
[18:00:51] <CWSpear> that's because the waypoint of that element has changed
[18:00:59] <CWSpear> you should have an unmoving wrapper
[18:01:24] <CWSpear> wait, it's off by 1 px?

[18:04:08] <CWSpear> Or are you wanting someone to build it for you?
[18:04:31] <Dotte> CWSpear, no I did try a couple of things but I don't get the remove thing to work

[18:07:06] <Dotte> http://pastebin.com/qwfMbKSf
[18:07:16] <Dotte> okay, wait please
[18:07:46] <Blade_> I solved it
[18:07:57] <Blade_> thanks for the help guys
[18:08:25] <CWSpear> Blade_, what was it?
[18:08:42] <Blade_> I had e.target.id on accident >.>
[18:08:55] <CWSpear> ???
[18:09:00] <Blade_> instead of e.target
[18:09:00] <joe-c> Okay easiest way to explain it. Ive got a 100px sticky menu at the top of the screen. Menu tiems are underlined as waypoints are passed. I'm using local scroll and scroll to to navigate the page. Localscroll has an offset of -100 (so it leaves 100px at the top of the screen for the menu). Therefore, the offset of waypoints.js is 100. However - if I set it to 100 then it only works on the way "down" the page (on the way up it
[18:09:00] <joe-c> leaves the previous navigation item highlighted, and if i set it to 99 then it only works on the way "up"
[18:09:00] <Blade_> I had
[18:09:06] <Blade_> ($e.target.id)
[18:09:06] <CWSpear> ah
[18:09:13] <Blade_> $(e.target.id) *
[18:09:19] <CWSpear> but $(e.target) got you there?
[18:09:22] <Blade_> yep
[18:09:30] <Dotte> CWSpear, b-ot, http://jsfiddle.net/DnFX7/
[18:10:03] <CWSpear> Dotte, a couple things: IDs should be unique
[18:10:22] <CWSpear> 2ndly, elements added to the DOM don't automatically have events added to them
[18:11:24] <Dotte> CWSpear, how can I change that ? when it adds an new element, it should change the first <a> to a "remove" action for a specific element
[18:13:42] <CWSpear> give it a different class to trigger a different event. here, take this:
[18:13:50] <CWSpear> http://jsfiddle.net/DnFX7/1/
[18:14:28] <CWSpear> So first off, I used .on() to bind the events
[18:14:38] <retran> what if you used .bind
[18:15:11] <CWSpear> this means anything with the class "ajouter" is clicked, even if it's added after the element is added to the DOM, it will still trigger the event
[18:15:51] <CWSpear> the syntax is different, but no, retran, .bind won't work in this case (at least for .supprirmer… I guess it could work with .ajouter) because we're added more elements to the DOM
[18:16:19] <retran> heh isn't bind depcrecated
[18:16:27] <CWSpear> I don't think so...
[18:16:30] <CWSpear> deletegate is
[18:16:38] <CWSpear> er, live is for sure
[18:16:48] <CWSpear> and then I set a 2nd event listener to listen for when I click on .supprimer, and it find its parent .form and then remove that
[18:16:55] <CWSpear> Making any sense, Dotte?
[18:17:02] <Dotte> CWSpear, yes!!
[18:17:07] <CWSpear> `api delegate
[18:17:08] <b-ot> CWSpear: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[18:17:22] <Dotte> I got the "ajouter" button out of the form and now it's visible at the end of the list
[18:17:34] <CWSpear> is that what you want?
[18:17:53] <Dotte> CWSpear, yeah, thanks a lot
[18:17:55] <RRR2> can regex ignore quoted strings?
[18:17:58] <CWSpear> ok, good
[18:18:14] <CWSpear> RRR2, what do you mean? What's the regex in question?
[18:19:35] <RRR2> like, I need to search for (test) so how would I get test ignoring the quoted string:    Hello! "test" test
[18:20:09] <RRR2> doublequotes and singlequotes
[18:20:41] <jennifer_> so many mysteries
[18:22:05] <CWSpear> I'm still not sure I understand. You want it to match the 2nd test, but not the one in the quotes?
[18:22:21] <RRR2> I don't want to match anything that is in the quotes
[18:22:35] <RRR2> like ignoring them..
[18:24:14] <RRR2> or indexOf too, like, what if I need to get the first ocurrence of 't' in "We are going 'to' be happy today" ignoring any quoted strings
[18:25:17] <joe-c> Righto CWSpear - here's a JSFiddle :) (took bloody ages!)
[18:25:18] <joe-c> http://jsfiddle.net/hDaqF/
[18:25:34] <joe-c> You'll notice that it works on the way down, but not on the way up
[18:26:19] <CWSpear> RRR2, I'm not really sure. There are some advanced regex's you could do with lookbacks (or whatever they're called), but it might be easiest to remove it first. one sec...
[18:26:48] <joe-c> however, if you make the offset 99, it works on the way up and not the way down
[18:27:17] <Blade_> joe-c: whats the question?
[18:27:21] <Blade_> I was AFK
[18:27:32] <joe-c> No worries :) if you take a look at that JSFiddle that I posted
[18:27:45] <Blade_> yeah but whats the question
[18:27:57] <Blade_> I see it
[18:28:00] <Blade_> changes colors on the clicks
[18:28:06] <joe-c> Ive got a 100px sticky menu at the top of the screen. Menu items are underlined as waypoints are passed using waypoints.js. I'm using local scroll and scroll to to navigate the page.
[18:28:40] <CWSpear> RRR2, str = str.replace(/(['"].*?['"])/g, ''); would remove all quoted strings
[18:28:42] <joe-c> i've set Localscroll has an offset of -100 (so it leaves 100px at the top of the screen for the menu). so the offset of waypoints.js is  set to 100 to take this into account. However - if I set it to 100 then it only works on the way "down" the page (on the way up it leaves the previous navigation item highlighted, and if i set it to 99 then it only works on the way "up"
[18:28:53] <CWSpear> then you could do your regex like normal
[18:29:24] <joe-c> I guess it's because it's the border, so if local scroll take syou exactly to 100 the it only fires on the way down.
[18:29:42] <joe-c> I guess the easiest way is to check the direction in the main method and if it's up, then highlight the one before
[18:29:46] <joe-c> Rather than messing with the offset
[18:29:51] <CWSpear> joe-c, I'm not seeing it change the selected nav item at all. is that what it's supposed to be doing?
[18:29:59] <Blade_> same here
[18:30:22] <joe-c> http://jsfiddle.net/hDaqF/1/
[18:30:26] <joe-c> so if you click on yellow, or red
[18:30:31] <joe-c> or any of those items
[18:30:42] <CWSpear> oh, there are errors
[18:30:45] <CWSpear> let me try the updated one
[18:32:12] <joe-c> that working for you mate?
[18:32:20] <CWSpear> the new one is, yes
[18:32:23] <joe-c> sorry this is my first jsfiddle just getting the hang of it :)
[18:32:23] <CWSpear> I see what you're saying
[18:33:01] <CWSpear> so the issue is that it's not going back to "Red" unless the offset is 99?
[18:33:38] <CWSpear> or that it's not resetting on the way back?
[18:33:42] <CWSpear> up*
[18:34:53] <joe-c> ignoring the top one (which is a bit different coz of the padding) the issue is that it works on the way down, but not on the way back
[18:35:14] <joe-c> as local scroll takes it to a point which is ofsetted 100, which still counts at the next one down
[18:35:19] <joe-c> if you get my meaning
[18:35:39] <CWSpear> http://jsfiddle.net/hDaqF/2/
[18:36:30] <CWSpear> does THAT work like you're asking? If not, I am still not sure what the question is, haha
[18:36:43] <CWSpear> I probably should have forked. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/YSY4j/
[18:37:42] <joe-c> Yeh I think that's got it :(
[18:37:43] <joe-c> :)
[18:37:45] <joe-c> Nice one thanks mate
[18:38:34] <CWSpear> joe-c, do you see what I did? and do you understand why that works? waypoint.js is only triggered when it encounters the element at the TOP
[18:38:57] <CWSpear> so as you were scrolling up, it was triggered JUST as the one you were scrolling away from went off screen
[18:39:19] <CWSpear> so if we're going up, we want to use the previous of the "current" waypoint
[18:39:25] <joe-c> yeh i get you, so basically you were able to just see if it's going up and if it is override the id to hit the previous menu item
[18:39:51] <joe-c> hmm you get the 'previous' from the divs yeh? not from the menu items?
[18:40:08] <joe-c> coz in my actual project there are other divs between red yellow green etc :)
[18:40:51] <joe-c> ah no that shouldn't matter as you're targeting by class
[18:40:52] <joe-c> one sec
[18:40:55] <CWSpear> Yeah, I think you understand the concept
[18:41:14] <CWSpear> they would still have to be siblings, tho, joe-c.
[18:41:42] <CWSpear> for what I did to work. but there are other ways to do that now that you've identified the issue
[18:42:36] <joe-c> yeh siblings is fine, and it doesn't matter if there are other ones in between as you use .waypoint to only look at the relevant ones yeh?
[18:42:47] <CWSpear> yes
[18:42:59] <joe-c> okay cool :)
[18:43:02] <joe-c> i'lll have a go, one sec
[18:43:22] <CWSpear> good luck
[18:43:23] <joe-c> thanks for your help
[18:43:28] <CWSpear> You're welcome
[18:43:41] <CWSpear> RRR2, did you get your thing figured out?
[18:47:24] <joe-c> weirdly, I'm getting 'undefined' for $(this).prev('.waypoint') on my one
[18:47:38] <joe-c> even though I've got several sibling sections with class of 'waypoint'
[18:52:22] <joe-c> ah okay so the .prev only works if there is a .waypoint div directly before it. if there is another div at the same level it doesn't
[18:58:38] <joe-c> ah - prevail, rather than prev() did the job!
[18:58:54] <CWSpear> sorry, I was afk. joe-c, you got it figured out?
[18:59:22] <joe-c> Yup justs used prevAll instead of Prev() to find the previous waypoint element and it's fine now :)
[18:59:23] <joe-c> ta!
[19:03:53] <delinquentme> so i'm attempting to use $.ajaxSubmit ... and it looks like the form data isn't being posted when the POST is made
[19:17:50] <Blade_> delinquentme why do you say that?
[19:19:25] <delinquentme> Blade_, its all good
[19:21:35] <RRR2> CWSpear: I don't want to remove the quoted strings, I need them
[19:22:34] <RRR2> CWSpear: Sorry for the delay, was eating.
[19:23:04] <CWSpear> RRR2, copy it into a nother variable
[19:23:08] <CWSpear> var str2 = ...
[19:23:35] <RRR2> Hmm
[19:26:39] <Blade_> alright cool
[19:26:49] <saddishwasher> \msg chanserv who am i
[19:26:54] <saddishwasher> haha
[19:27:48] <\mSg> That is a question only oneself can answer.
[19:29:21] <CWSpear> will that work RRR2?
[19:29:44] <RRR2> I don't think
[19:30:04] <CWSpear> you're gonna have to give us a more complete picture of what you're trying to do
[19:30:18] <RRR2> True
[19:33:33] <RRR2> Alright, say I want to get "start word 'universe' 'stuff' 'word' 'end'    end" (which is a substring from a larger substring)
[19:33:57] <RRR2> how do I get from start to end.
[19:34:16] <RRR2> a sbustring from a larger string*
[19:47:11] <bjorn_> whats the opposite of this
[19:47:12] <bjorn_>         $('#shold a').attr( 'onClick', 'return false' );
[19:47:48] <retran> what's that mean 'opposite'
[19:48:45] <tw2113> O.o
[19:49:57] <RRR2> like a removeEventListener?
[19:51:49] <bjorn_> yea
[19:51:52] <bjorn_> so what i want
[19:51:59] <bjorn_> is fr the onclick to be true now
[19:52:09] <bjorn_> $('#shold a').attr( 'onClick', 'return false' );
[19:52:14] <bjorn_> $('#shold a').attr( 'onClick', 'return true' );
[19:52:28] <RRR2> Well, it overrides it
[19:52:36] <RRR2> so you can just do it.. like that
[19:52:49] <bjorn_> but ti doenst work :(
[19:53:09] <ngharo> is that just an example? because binding events using attr is just whacky
[19:53:21] <RRR2> It.. doesn't?
[19:53:23] <bjorn_> yea just an example
[19:53:28] <bjorn_> pretty much
[19:53:40] <RRR2> No, overriding it should work
[19:53:44] <bjorn_> onclick i want to disable it being clicked again
[19:53:56] <RRR2> there can only be 1 function on the onclick attribute
[19:53:56] <bjorn_> then during another event i want to enable it to be clicked
[19:54:03] <bjorn_> two events
[19:54:17] <bjorn_> 1 disables
[19:54:21] <bjorn_> then another enables
[19:54:55] <ngharo> bjorn, you want to use .one()
[19:55:11] <ngharo> rebind it using one() when you want it active again
[19:55:15] <tw2113> my head says it'd be easier to just attach a click call back to all links, and then check for something that determines if to allow the click or not
[19:55:30] <tw2113> say attach a data attribute that says allow or disallow
[19:55:44] <tw2113> if it equals disallow, prevent the default action
[19:56:29] <bjorn_> kk
[19:56:49] <shoky> what does your heart say, tw2113
[19:57:02] <tw2113> that i'm out of beer
[19:57:10] <tw2113> but there's more in the fridge
[19:57:19] <shoky> that's quite a dilemma
[19:57:33] <tw2113> i know, it's all the way in the kitchen
[19:57:43] <tw2113> and i don't have a beer wench to serve me
[19:58:18] <shoky> now you know what you need to get. i'm glad we had this conversation
[19:59:00] <RRR2> bjorn, now I remember that you can't simply edit the onclick attribute as you do with the DOM
[19:59:06] <RRR2> you have to use a function
[20:00:22] <RRR2> .onclick=function(){return true}, however I don't know if it will work with jQuery as $('#shold a').attr( 'onClick', function(){return true;} );
[20:00:34] <RRR2> try itanyway
[20:02:12] <dbizzy_> $("#foo button").on("click", "tr", function(event){   alert($(this).text()); });
[20:02:13] <ValsiS> i think i will go to die :(
[20:02:41] <ValsiS> can someone have 3 min to see what is the problem on my XHR call :(
[20:02:57] <RRR2> what is it?
[20:03:07] <shoky> ValsiS: if you stop whining and say what the problem is, maybe
[20:03:27] <RRR2> AKA don't ask to ask, just ask
[20:05:07] <ValsiS> i don't know how to explain you,     when i select an option from a list ... i will recive an xhr data in a specifiv    div
[20:05:38] <ValsiS> that div will execute  some js code  and have some html data
[20:05:49] <ValsiS> everything works very good on first request
[20:06:39] <shoky> ?p
[20:06:40] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:06:41] <ValsiS> on second request  comes the problems :)    some html is duplicated
[20:07:00] <RRR2> you can make a jsfiddle if you like, or simply link your page or whatever you please, but show some code
[20:07:29] <ValsiS> http://www.valsis.ro/tmp/hex_chat_1.png
[20:07:43] <shoky> that's not code
[20:07:46] <ValsiS> i don't know what code to put there ... because it's something very complex
[20:07:55] <shoky> then we don't know how to help you
[20:08:05] <RRR2> lol
[20:08:08] <ValsiS> i can share my screen ... or   if someone have teamviewer
[20:08:29] <RRR2> just create a jsfiddle
[20:09:16] <RRR2> or paste the code in some pastebin
[20:09:23] <libin__> can someone please please help me with some basic php. i am unable to log to #php
[20:09:38] <shoky> libin__: you need to register your nick.  type /msg nickserv help register
[20:09:49] <libin__> i have done it
[20:09:57] <shoky> and, it's ##php i think
[20:09:59] <libin__> i am registered as libin
[20:10:02] <ValsiS> i'm sure you will don't understand nothing from that jsfiddle :P but i will try
[20:10:04] <shoky> not as libin__ ?
[20:10:14] <RRR2> libin__: you could use ##programming since it's not language specific
[20:10:19] <libin__> no
[20:10:23] <libin__> thanks
[20:10:27] <shoky> then you're not registered
[20:12:10] <ValsiS> http://jsfiddle.net/d3T4b/
[20:12:47] <ValsiS> offff
[20:13:34] <RRR2> what does the xhr function says?
[20:13:35] <shoky> we're supposed to make up "xhr" function by ourselves? have some sense. we can't help you if you don't help us
[20:14:00] <RRR2> lol
[20:14:39] <shoky> and from what you said the problem doesn't even have to do with the xhr
[20:14:46] <ValsiS> http://jsfiddle.net/d3T4b/2/
[20:14:49] <ValsiS> let's see
[20:14:51] <shoky> it's that you're not emptying some container
[20:14:56] <ngharo> xhr = function() { $('body').wiggle() };
[20:14:58] <shoky> and just appending stuff to it
[20:16:24] <RRR2> shoky is right, you're not emptying the container
[20:16:25] <ValsiS> on first call everything works ok ...   but the div from the twitter bootstrat is inside the     CTable ID
[20:16:42] <libin__> RRR2.. stil no luck with it
[20:16:46] <ValsiS> id not inside
[20:16:48] <ValsiS> sorry
[20:16:56] <libin__> i have tried both libin and libin_
[20:17:00] <ValsiS> document.getElementById(fId).innerHTML = parseScript(xhr.responseText);
[20:17:24] <ValsiS> i rewrite the container
[20:18:11] <ValsiS> but on every call some div doesn't want to go in that container
[20:18:23] <ValsiS> that div responsable with the bootstrap modal
[20:18:46] <ValsiS> and because of that i have duplicate divs
[20:18:57] <ValsiS> sorry for my bad english :(
[20:35:43] <dbizzy> $(".party").on('drink', 'beer', function(smashed){($(this).appendTo('boy')});
[22:30:12] <trewd6> anyone alive?
[22:45:14] <sammichToo> curious, is it recommended to add/remove <style> tags to change the way your page looks? Say intead of you adding a .enabledLook class to all your .something elements, you'd just add a <style> tag with .something { <rules in .enabledLook> }?
[22:45:55] <sammichToo> save traversing the DOM for .something, adding in .enabledLook, and vice versa when you remove it
[23:00:01] <Eviltwin> sammichToo: It's generally not a good idea to add, remove, or modify <style> tags with any frequency
[23:00:26] <Eviltwin> If you're going to load some CSS once or you're going to remove CSS once you know it will no longer be used on the page that's one thing
[23:00:46] <Eviltwin> But making frequent changes is generally considered a bad practice and is slow
[23:32:07] <sammichToo> Eviltwin: thanks for replying, I think there's a cleaner way of doing that with a 'parent' class that would trigger other classes
[23:33:14] <sammichToo> since the elements already have the classes on them, I can enable or disable styles on them by giving a parent element that enabler class
[23:45:22] <Eviltwin> sammichToo: Yup, that's the best way to do it
