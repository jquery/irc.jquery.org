[00:00:01] <twolfson> then...
[00:00:08] <twolfson> the whole exercise is moot
[00:00:12] <CodeZombie> I _really_ want to know why we're still dealing with 100% height issues, so many years into css
[00:00:30] <CodeZombie> I _almost_ went with a table layout
[00:00:42] <Clorith> If you give body, html { height: 100% } you should be one step closer
[00:00:45] <twolfson> can you 'splain why you need no scrollbars?
[00:00:51] <CodeZombie> Clorith: did that
[00:00:56] <Clorith> Ahh, ok
[00:01:07] <Clorith> Well, I'm gonna follow that up with a jQuery problem I'm having ;P
[00:01:35] <CodeZombie> twolfson: image a 2 column layout, main and left sidebar... in the sidebar is a list of controls. In the right sidebar is a 2560x1440 image, inside a div with overflow:scroll set
[00:01:39] <Clorith> I'm trying to look up each date in a datepicker to find out if it's a busy day (in a scheduling system) and return if it's selectable or not, as well as a class to colorcode them and a tooltip
[00:01:48] <CodeZombie> now, image the content scrollbar, next to the browser scrollbar
[00:01:50] <CodeZombie> *ew*
[00:01:59] <Clorith> I made a jsfiddle, but unfortunately I can't make the iddle work at all, and in my testcase on localhost it keeps returning false so no dates are selectable
[00:02:03] <Clorith> http://jsfiddle.net/Guxp8/3/
[00:03:08] <twolfson> sooo
[00:03:14] <twolfson> disable the window's scrollbars
[00:03:20] <twolfson> y scrollbar
[00:03:26] <Ray24> what is this channel about?
[00:03:34] <Ray24> What can you learn here
[00:03:47] <Clorith> Voodoo magic.
[00:03:54] <Ray24> I don't appreciate being lied to
[00:04:00] <Ray24> can someone give honest answer
[00:04:09] <twolfson> CodeZombie: body { overflow: scroll-x; }
[00:04:11] <Xotix> read the topic
[00:04:15] <Ray24> I don't know how to read
[00:04:18] <Ray24> could you read it for me
[00:04:27] <CodeZombie> twolfson: doesn't matter... still need to scroll both directions
[00:04:34] <twolfson> then...
[00:04:38] <Xotix> if i were admin you would have been kicked out
[00:04:40] <CodeZombie> 2560x1440 is large
[00:04:42] <Ray24> LOL
[00:04:44] <twolfson> you can't scroll withouth a scrollbar
[00:04:55] <Clorith> Just don't feed the trolls, they grow tired shortly
[00:04:56] <Ray24> Xotix then why aren't you admin? lacking qualifications?
[00:05:47] <Ray24> So really what can i learn from this channel? It's supposed to be popular
[00:06:01] <ajpiano> Ray24: it's a channel for support and discussion of the jQuery library
[00:06:18] <ajpiano> it's fairly active
[00:06:33] <Ray24> can you use jquery as a hacking tool?
[00:06:39] <Xotix> yes
[00:06:43] <Xotix> just read the manual...
[00:07:01] <ajpiano> the best way to get way acclimated to an IRC channel is to just watching how it is when you aren't talking
[00:07:05] <Ray24> Reading doesn't develop skills.
[00:07:13] <Ray24> obviously your skills are not up to par
[00:07:54] <Ray24> I'm just kidding. I respect everyone here. You guys are hard workers
[00:08:03] <Ray24> Keep up the good work and I'll be on my way
[00:08:19] <CodeZombie> twolfson: that was just my argument against height:100%. with explicit 100% height, you get an uneeded scrollbar
[00:08:25] <ajpiano> ok!
[00:08:30] <CodeZombie> which is why I went with jQuery
[00:09:58] <Ray24> Why are people talking about scroll bars?
[00:10:09] <Ray24> I'd go insane if that's all I think about all day.
[00:10:25] <ajpiano> because someone has a specific issue they are attempting to remedy
[00:10:34] <Xotix> Whats the ignore func on freenode?
[00:10:50] <ajpiano> Ray24: are you new to IRC
[00:10:53] <ajpiano> ?
[00:10:56] <Ray24> I'm new to google
[00:11:05] <ajpiano> ...
[00:11:13] <Ray24> What? Google is knowledge
[00:11:16] <Clorith> Xotix, probably /silence +user|hostname
[00:11:37] <Ray24> Why are you guys so easily irritated?
[00:11:41] <Clorith> But I do believ ethat's per session if it works
[00:12:05] <Xotix> Hmm, no.
[00:12:11] <Ray24> Actually, ignore functions only work until I leave the channel, which I can return and hear from me again.
[00:12:14] <Clorith> Your client might have /ignore
[00:12:32] <Ray24> LOL
[00:12:40] <Ray24> Ok, I'll ask one more questions before I leave
[00:12:51] <Ray24> Is this your career?
[00:13:00] <ajpiano> what?
[00:13:06] <ajpiano> doing support in the jQuery channel?
[00:13:08] <jita> Does this $(function () {} every time page loads/refreshes ?
[00:13:08] <Ray24> is jquery part of your career?
[00:13:09] <ajpiano> writing javascript?
[00:13:11] <ajpiano> yes.
[00:13:13] <Ray24> yeah writing javascripts
[00:13:26] <Ray24> what would you do if your girlfriend is dating a lawyer?
[00:13:31] <Ray24> I mean, behind your back
[00:13:32] <Xotix> hmm got it, :)
[00:13:37] <ajpiano> my girlfriend is dating me, not a problem
[00:13:52] <Ray24> How do you know she isn't bored? I mean, about the whol javascript writing thing
[00:13:58] <Ray24> whole*
[00:14:10] <ajpiano> Ray24: come on
[00:14:17] <Ray24> what if she's out there chilling with more masculine dudes who drive monster trucks
[00:14:22] <Ray24> I'm just instrospecting
[00:14:29] <Xotix> ajpiano: just ignore him
[00:14:32] <Ray24> cmon man
[00:14:43] <Ray24> wtf
[00:14:46] <Ray24> jsut happened
[00:14:48] <coldhead> sup ray
[00:14:51] <Ray24> sup son
[00:14:51] <Clorith> Cookies for cold <3
[00:14:53] <Ray24> you just kicked me
[00:15:08] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[00:15:37] <ajpiano> thx coldhead
[00:15:55] <jita> lol
[00:16:00] <coldhead> he is PMing me home truths about my sexuality now
[00:16:13] <coldhead> which is very upsetting for my mother who is reading over my shoulder
[00:16:15] <ajpiano> coldhead: excellent, you needed to know
[00:16:16] <Clorith> Aren't you glad he's here to help you see who you truly are? xD
[00:16:17] <coldhead> pining for grandchildren
[00:16:29] <ajpiano> Xotix: i was sort of trying to draw him out a bit
[00:16:42] <coldhead> <Ray24> ill fuck you up
[00:16:51] <iYuri> hi, how could I pass a variable to a get() function and use it into the function??
[00:16:54] <iYuri> like this http://jsfiddle.net/d3z23/
[00:17:00] <ajpiano> coldhead: lol
[00:17:51] <FleetFox> Wtf so many trolls today
[00:18:03] <Clorith> It's one of those days I guess =(
[00:18:09] <Xotix> ajpiano: ignore works better ^^
[00:20:30] <jita> Any idea why select class is not being applied in this $('<select class="form-error"></select>').insertBefore($stateInput).change(function() ?
[00:20:51] <jita> it just passes select class='   ' to the template
[00:21:00] <iYuri> Jita: use $('select.form-error').insert...
[00:21:07] <ajpiano> jita: your quotes are off
[00:21:09] <iYuri> ops XD
[00:21:12] <iYuri> sorry :)
[00:21:30] <ajpiano> "<select class='form-error'></select>"
[00:22:18] <iYuri> nobody knows how could I pass a variable to a get() function and use it into the function??
[00:22:22] <iYuri> this is my code
[00:22:22] <iYuri> http://jsfiddle.net/d3z23/
[00:23:00] <ajpiano> iYuri: there's nothing wrong with what you're doing in principle
[00:23:08] <ajpiano> just that it's this.id or $(this).attr("id')
[00:23:11] <ajpiano> not $(this).id
[00:23:29] <iYuri> the id is correctly got
[00:23:36] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[00:23:38] <iYuri> if I alert it before $.get()
[00:23:41] <iYuri> it is shown
[00:23:52] <Clorith> It can't be, there's no .id selector ...
[00:23:53] <iYuri> but it is undefined inside the function
[00:23:55] <iYuri> :|
[00:23:56] <jita> ajpiano, still not working :(
[00:24:00] <ajpiano> dude $(this).id is as wrong as a 3 dollar bill
[00:24:35] <ajpiano> iYuri: there's nothing about that code that would cause 'pid' to go away
[00:25:04] <iYuri> .attr("id') worked O_O
[00:25:09] <Clorith> You also don't need that .empty() since .html will overwrite existing content for you
[00:25:11] <iYuri> that's quite strange
[00:25:29] <Clorith> But that's just me nitpicking =)
[00:25:38] <iYuri> thanks ajpiano
[00:25:42] <ajpiano> Clorith: i was gonna say the same :)
[00:25:43] <drjones69> iYuri: Just a thought, but isn't pid local to the parent function?  Perhaps set a var pid = 1; as a global at the top?
[00:25:56] <ajpiano> drjones69: that is the opposite of necessary
[00:25:58] <iYuri> thank you Clorith for the suggestion :)
[00:26:10] <JohnnyDavidson> Say I wanted to put an entire function into it's own js file to make things easier to read
[00:26:19] <ajpiano> functions that are nested inside of other functions are able to see the local vars of the functions inside of which they are nested
[00:26:28] <iYuri> drjones69 pid is local to the function, but global to the inner function I guess...isn't it?
[00:26:31] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I do that?
[00:26:45] <ajpiano> by dong it
[00:26:46] <JohnnyDavidson> If I add it before my main js file, or after, I both get reference errors
[00:27:35] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone know?
[00:27:40] <ajpiano> is your main js file not exposing values that it assumes will be there were it inside of that file (inside of a closure, perhaps?)
[00:27:59] <drjones69> iYuri: So I've just been informed ;-) IS there any html to go on the fiddle - gives an error when I try and run it on account of no document to run against.
[00:28:08] <FleetFox> Is there anyting readable about javascript scopes sometimes i get really confused
[00:28:29] <JohnnyDavidson> Let's say I did like a.js, then b.js, and in a.js there is a(){b();} and in b.js there is b(){}
[00:28:39] <JohnnyDavidson> But if both functions were in a.js it would be fine
[00:28:46] <JohnnyDavidson> But since it's added in a later file, it doesn't work
[00:28:48] <ajpiano> FleetFox: http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/
[00:29:20] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: i think you don't understand how scope works, files have nothing to do with it
[00:29:29] <FleetFox> thanks
[00:29:44] <JohnnyDavidson> What's wrong with it then?
[00:29:57] <ajpiano> it's hard for an outsider to see
[00:30:03] <Trisox> morning ajpiano
[00:30:20] <JohnnyDavidson> What does that mean?
[00:30:52] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: it means you are speaking in generalities, assuming you are making a generic mistake related to "files"
[00:30:54] <Xotix> imagen you got 2 points, both draggable. Can you draw a line between them also while dragging?
[00:31:14] <jita> ajpiano, thanks it works :)
[00:31:23] <ajpiano> but in reality it's probably just where inside of the first file you had the function defined, was it private? nested inside of some document ready function perhaps, etc?
[00:31:45] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: the only way someone can definitively state what the problem is to see your actual code
[00:32:29] <drjones69> iYuri: Isn't the callback in $.get() the 3rd parameter?
[00:32:54] <ajpiano> drjones69: it doesn't have to be, jquery does it right if you omit the data argument
[00:33:01] <ajpiano> but you are somewhat right
[00:33:19] <drjones69> ajpiano: Ah, I see now (reviewing el docs)
[00:33:20] <Clorith> http://jsfiddle.net/Clorith/Guxp8/5/ <-- I've not jsLint'ed it as well, and I stil lcna't even make the jsfiddle test case work to display a datepicker
[00:33:24] <ajpiano> iYuri: $.get("content.php", { val: value, sort: pid }, function(data) {}) is what he really wants
[00:33:28] <ajpiano> is what you*
[00:33:57] <JohnnyDavidson> I got it to work
[00:34:09] <iYuri> this would be better, isn't it?! :D
[00:34:14] <iYuri> I'll write it like this!
[00:35:19] <basilbear> Just ask! No PMs, plz.  - what are PMs?
[00:35:34] <basilbear> public  moans?
[00:35:41] <Xotix> IS there a plugin which draws a line like that but interactive? http://jsbin.com/evoloy/2/edit#preview
[00:35:56] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: good
[00:35:59] <ajpiano> !
[00:36:04] <ajpiano> basilbear: private messages
[00:36:05] <TonkaTruck> basilbear: private massages with happy ending
[00:36:21] <Pedobear1968> basilbear: hi
[00:36:23] <Pedobear1968> i'm a bear too
[00:36:27] <Clorith> Xotix, you could look into Raphael
[00:36:30] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: Aren't you in boston?  How can you possibly be awake?
[00:36:43] <basilbear> pedobear1968: yo!
[00:36:47] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: i'm in nyc, but same time zone
[00:36:53] <Xotix> http://raphaeljs.com/graffle.html
[00:36:58] <ajpiano> i don't know why i am awake
[00:37:01] <Xotix> :) thanks actualyl i've seen this before
[00:37:02] <Xotix> nice
[00:37:16] <Clorith> Yeah I've used it before, it's quite good
[00:37:26] <basilbear> pedobear1968: bearing up?
[00:37:26] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: I just watched the ted talk for that kahn academy that jresig works for now.  So insane.
[00:38:38] <TonkaTruck> I hope somehow that jquery can be involved in the future of education.
[00:39:44] <ajpiano> i hope that jquery can be involved in me going to sleep
[00:39:49] <ajpiano> peace out #jquery
[00:39:52] <TonkaTruck> sorry, "khan academy" www.khanacademy.org
[00:40:20] <ajpiano> ps yes
[00:42:54] <TonkaTruck> I also think there should be a khan subject for js and jquery.
[00:43:25] <basilbear1> basilbear1: hello from cousin :)
[00:43:30] <TonkaTruck> His platform is ripe for extension.
[00:45:39] <Clorith> Hm, I've now done some console logging, and I see that my beforeShowDay ajax query isn't running until AFTER it's done processing everything, is there a way to tell it to wait for a response before it draws everything ?
[00:47:16] <TonkaTruck> Clorith: Totally.  I believe $.ajax returns a deferred.  If you wrap it's response in a $.when(_do your ajax_).then(_ur ajax is here_); you can't lose, bro.
[00:47:48] <TonkaTruck> Optionally, use the success/error callbacks.
[00:48:40] <Clorith> well, I am runnign the success one (it's what populates the array I return to determine if a date is selectable etc).
[00:48:59] <Clorith> But that doen'st help because it triggers the ajax, but doens't wait for a response for some reason
[00:50:10] <Pedobear1968> k1ng: hi
[00:50:11] <TonkaTruck> Clorith: jsfiddle your code or paste it somewhere.
[00:50:13] <Pedobear1968> k1ttty: hi *
[00:50:17] <TonkaTruck> I will help u bro
[00:50:18] <Pedobear1968> how old are you?
[00:50:30] <k1ng> Pedobear1968, ?
[00:50:31] <k1ng> hi
[00:50:32] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: datepicker def doesn't expect you to do ajax in beforeShowDay, he'd have to duckpunch the function
[00:50:38] <Clorith> TonkaTruck like this; http://jsfiddle.net/Clorith/Guxp8/5/ ? :P
[00:50:38] <k1ng> ah
[00:50:43] <ajpiano> omg
[00:50:44] <ajpiano> omg
[00:50:45] <ajpiano> OMG
[00:50:46] <ajpiano> WTF
[00:50:48] <thomedy> im having an issue with jquery
[00:50:58] <Clorith> I've commented out the ajax as  Iwas testing without it to see that I was doing it right
[00:51:02] <thomedy> its .css('left': number);
[00:51:04] <k1ng> when the jqueryUI colorpicker will be releasd?
[00:51:04] <thomedy> right
[00:51:05] <TonkaTruck> zomyjesus holy god
[00:51:08] <TonkaTruck> wtf is happening
[00:51:10] <ajpiano> holy crap i am banning that guy for like 3 months
[00:51:15] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: that guy detaillifinu
[00:51:22] <ajpiano> has been trolling this channel in different personae
[00:51:25] <ajpiano> for like several weeks
[00:51:28] <ajpiano> and then denying it
[00:51:43] <thomedy> ive done left, and left: and i dont think its working
[00:52:24] <Clorith> Hmm, if it done'st expect an ajax, if I throw the ajax in a function and then return the result of that function (making the function not return anything till it has the ajax result), would that possibly be a way around it ?
[00:52:47] <Clorith> it's .css('left','number') by the way =)
[00:53:04] <drjones69> Clorith: Would setting async:false in the call solve the problme?
[00:53:39] <thomedy> thank i just realized that may not be the problem
[00:53:51] <Clorith> drjones69, yes it would!
[00:53:55] <thomedy> it is working i think in fact i htink that the problem may be event.target.id
[00:54:03] <TonkaTruck> I'm confused as to what's going on.
[00:54:04] <thomedy> thank you by the way...
[00:54:19] <thomedy> my id is the string two
[00:54:20] <drjones69> Clorith: Although I suspect it might (potentially) lead to a bit of browser stutter.
[00:54:23] <thomedy> id='two'
[00:54:26] <TonkaTruck> Don't even want to look at fiddles anymore.
[00:54:28] <thomedy> im comparing
[00:54:40] <thomedy> if event.target.id == 'two'
[00:54:48] <thomedy> and i think that may be my problem
[00:54:56] <Clorith> drjones69, yeah I suspect so as well, that's why I'll give my function idea a whirl as well to see if it wil lfucntion, if I can run it async then nothing better
[00:55:15] <thomedy> maybe not actually
[00:55:21] <thomedy> hmmm ill figure it out
[00:55:48] <JohnnyDavidson> you can also do .css({'x' : 'y', 'a' : 'b'});
[00:55:59] <thomedy> yeah i saw taht.. thank  you though
[00:56:06] <JohnnyDavidson> And set multiple elements like you would with a normal css, except you need to wrap them in quotes
[00:56:21] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: I didn't even know he was talking about datepicker.
[00:56:25] <JohnnyDavidson> And replace ; with ,
[00:56:28] <drjones69> Clorith: Indeed :-)
[00:57:33] <ajpiano> TonkaTruck: ah
[00:57:39] <ajpiano> yeah, beforeShowDay is a datepicker callback
[00:58:20] <TonkaTruck> I just saw "ajax query"
[00:58:37] <nagisaf> #java
[00:58:45] <TonkaTruck> and went into my shamelessly pedantic async lesson mode
[00:59:00] <Clorith> Fucntion idea, not so much, I'll ahve to do it without async directly in the beforeShowDay it seems
[00:59:44] <ajpiano> the only way to do it without async is to override the function in datepicker that calls beforeShowDay
[01:00:00] <Clorith> Sounds like more work then it's really worth
[01:00:05] <ajpiano> and make that function expect that beforeShowDay could return a deferred
[01:00:17] <ajpiano> depends how bad you think async: false is :)
[01:00:47] <Clorith> well, it will only be called like 5-10 times max on the page so I think it might work, if it turns out ot be an issue in the long run i'll have to revisit it though
[01:18:13] <iYuri> how could I position the cursor at the end of an input field?
[01:18:33] <iYuri> I'm using focus() but the cursor is positioned at the begin of the text
[01:21:13] <Xotix> You may put this in the topic? http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[01:22:10] <iYuri> -_-
[01:22:43] <iYuri> $('input#'+pi).focus();
[01:22:53] <labratt> ok i have an easy slider that just clicks through an LI but its not display the last LI http://jsfiddle.net/labratt/Jd4CH/3/
[01:25:09] <xec> labratt: http://jsfiddle.net/Jd4CH/4/
[01:25:22] <xec> labratt: nth-child() is not zero indexed
[01:25:36] <labratt> aaahhhh
[01:25:42] <labratt> nice thanks
[01:25:56] <xec> np
[01:26:25] <labratt> one more think how would i do a previous button in that script
[01:26:52] <labratt> copy my link and do count-- ?
[01:26:57] <Logitech> Hi, I have a input type button with an ID, var clickedButton = $(partsID);  doesn't seem to get the object, how do I select it properly?
[01:27:09] <xec> labratt: do basically the same logic just check for count == 1 instead
[01:27:19] <xec> and count-- yea
[01:28:27] <Xotix> Logitech: http://jsbin.com/ularah u used ready()?
[01:29:00] <Xotix> http://jsbin.com/ularah/edit#javascript,html

[01:35:22] <Logitech> Xotix: That seems to work properly, let me try getting my variable in there and see what happens, one minute
[01:36:15] <labratt> dec i got it to work but can you tell me if this is the right way of doing this
[01:36:16] <labratt> http://jsfiddle.net/labratt/Jd4CH/5/
[01:36:22] <labratt> xec
[01:38:06] <xec> labratt: i'm sure if it could be optimized, but it works nicely, and theres nothing inherently wrong with your approach
[01:38:18] <Xotix> Logitech: val()
[01:38:21] <labratt> ok thanks
[01:39:04] <schu> hi. i have a list of images (let's say 9) and i want to wrap every three of them with a div - can anyone point me to a solution?
[01:39:50] <labratt> prepend and append
[01:40:16] <labratt> or wrap
[01:40:35] <labratt> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[01:40:58] <twolfson> does jquery have a .slice for its object?
[01:41:26] <twolfson> if so, .slice(0, 3).wrap().end().slice(4,6).wrap().end().slice(7).wrap()
[01:41:40] <twolfson> not sure if that is legit code though =/
[01:41:51] <Logitech> Xotix: I think the partsID selector isnt working, can you have a look? -> http://jsbin.com/ularah/6/edit#source
[01:43:21] <Xotix> what exactly are you trying to do?
[01:43:41] <Logitech> I have an order line with a 'add_to_cart'-button
[01:43:52] <Logitech> these order lines are being generated by javascript
[01:44:03] <Logitech> all of them have the partsid as the button id
[01:44:34] <Logitech> so on a click I want to remove the onclick attribute so it cant be called again (and change the attribute with the image link to another image)
[01:46:36] <Logitech> so basically: onclick -> select clicked button with id == partsid -> removeAttr("onclick") -> setAttr("http://successImage.png")
[01:46:42] <Logitech> do you understand what I'm trying to do?
[01:48:12] <Cork> Logitech: why use onclick
[01:48:25] <Cork> put the logic into a normal handler and it should be easier
[01:49:05] <Cork> those old dom1 event handlers is often a pain to work with
[01:49:10] <Xotix> prop("onclick", null); Logitech i've never done that before but with google you should have get it by your own. make sure you include jquery at jsbin and if you want to use an jquery method you need a jquery object note the $() at clickedButton
[01:49:55] <Xotix> And listen to cork. IF the id is equal to the order, you could use index()
[01:50:28] <Cork> and if you use live or delegate you can handle all your items with ONE event handler
[01:50:31] <thomedy602> okay i have made a pastebin... and ive been dealing wtih this eror the logic is very similar in both pages.. basically im building a pager.. but the css is not resetting so hmmm
[01:50:33] <thomedy602> http://jsfiddle.net/vpeFN/11/
[01:50:47] <thomedy602> i would really appreciate some help if anyone is willing
[01:51:20] <Logitech> Cork: What is a 'normal' handler? Like $(#input).jqueryFunction  ?  The thing which is being called every time an input type is clicked?
[01:51:36] <thomedy602> you know what before you look at taht let me make one change
[01:51:59] <Cork> Logitech: .click, .bind('click', .live('click, .delegate('', 'click'
[01:52:16] <Cork> Logitech: dom2 event handlers
[01:52:54] <Logitech> I see, how can I make that dynamic?
[01:52:57] <labratt> dec are you still around?
[01:53:05] <labratt> xec are you still around?

[02:21:59] <Lovealot> Hi, is it ok to discuss mobile gaming in this channel?
[02:22:51] <dodo3625> I am using json to retreive data from a API source then have the content slide with jquery plugin bxslider. However the content gets cuts off but only on the first cycle. Once its gone through all of the <li> it aligns perfectly for the second loop, Any ideas why it dosnt align correcly initially?
[02:23:02] <Cork> Lovealot: uh, if its about the games code and its written in jquery, posibly
[02:23:06] <Cork> otherwise no
[02:24:53] <thomedy602> i just realized my logic is fine but my target dint' have an id
[02:25:13] <dodo3625> cork: can you help me with something?
[02:26:09] <Cork> dodo3625: what browser?
[02:26:22] <dodo3625> crhome
[02:26:26] <dodo3625> or firefox
[02:26:36] <thomedy602> now just to figure out why my css isn't runing
[02:26:38] <thomedy602> .css
[02:26:39] <thomedy602> i mean
[02:26:54] <dodo3625> even in safari
[02:27:18] <Cork> dodo3625: might be the html your generating isn't closed properly?
[02:27:24] <Cork> (only guessing)
[02:27:57] <dodo3625>            $('<li>' + review.review.summary+ '</li>').appendTo('#results');
[02:29:33] <dodo3625> cork: it has to be something with the plugin i guess because if i just display the <li>'s without the slider they are centered nicely
[02:30:16] <dodo3625> cork: just dosn't make sense why they would align correctly after the first loop

[02:37:15] <SoulRaven> hi
[02:37:32] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to detect when title atribute on a button has been changed?
[02:38:32] <SoulRaven> or something to detect when an attribute of an element has been changed
[02:43:00] <quicksilver> SoulRaven: there is a DOMAttrModified event but most browsers do not support DOM events.
[02:43:10] <Logitech> Could somebody explain why my onclick attribute isn't being removed? -> http://jsbin.com/ularah/19/edit
[02:44:14] <Cork> Logitech: cause your diffling with the attributes and not the handlers
[02:44:21] <Cork> don't use those old events
[02:44:28] <Cork> *fiddeling
[02:44:52] <Logitech> I see
[02:44:59] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to detect when title atribute on a button has been changed?
[02:45:01] <SoulRaven> or something to detect when an attribute of an element has been changed
[02:45:04] <Cork> .onclick is not the same thing as the dom's onclick attribute
[02:45:32] <Logitech> Oh, really? That explains a lot
[02:45:39] <Cork> you could posibly do it through prop
[02:45:45] <Cork> but its inposible with attr
[02:46:04] <Cork> but as i said before, there is better, MUCH better ways to do it
[02:46:14] <quicksilver> SoulRaven: I just answered you.
[02:46:20] <Logitech> but how do I set it up with these dynamic ids?
[02:46:26] <Logitech> how do I identify that specific line?
[02:47:01] <Cork> Logitech: css selectors
[02:47:11] <Cork> i would do it through delegate
[02:47:49] <SoulRaven> Cork: how, to iterate each elements and detect changes?
[02:48:08] <Cork> Logitech: $('ul').delegate('li', 'click', function(event) { this is the element clicked });
[02:48:29] <Cork> SoulRaven: detect changes can only be done by storing what they where
[02:48:45] <Logitech> css selectors, live, delegate.. -> let me implement that line of code
[02:49:56] <SoulRaven> so is it imposibile to trigger and action when a attribute has been changed, using the live monitoring technik
[02:50:49] <ibizaman> hi all, I'm using the great http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote now, and I can't seem to find how does it handle a deletion of a tag (if a user simply deletes it)
[02:52:51] <Logitech> Cork: http://jsbin.com/ularah/20/edit
[02:53:14] <Logitech> Doesn't seem to do anything yet
[02:53:51] <Cork> Logitech: your adding the table dynamically too do you need to bind it heigher in the tree
[02:54:12] <Cork> whats in the $() selector has to exist, whgats in the delegate doens't
[02:54:17] <Cork> *whats
[02:55:04] <Logitech> I see, it is working now
[02:55:40] <Cork> Logitech: try something like this http://jsbin.com/ularah/21/edit
[02:55:52] <Cork> hag halft right...
[02:56:05] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/ularah/22/edit
[02:57:10] <Logitech> Exactly, now how to identify the specific line on id and remove this click functionality?
[02:58:02] <Cork> Logitech: add a class to the line and change 'td' to 'td:not(.selected)' or something?
[02:59:17] <Cork> Logitech: http://jsbin.com/ularah/23/edit
[02:59:30] <Cork> (untested)
[03:01:06] <Logitech> Very interesting, thanks mate, I will fiddle around with this for a little bit
[03:02:42] <Cork> Logitech: good hunting! :)
[03:14:03] <jetienne> jquery got a busywheel ? is there a way to do with in full js ?
[03:15:26] <JKarsrud> what's a busywheel?
[03:16:45] <Oldskool> i guess an ajax loader ?
[03:17:09] <jetienne> this is a icon moving to show that the computer is buzy
[03:17:23] <JKarsrud> hmm, in that case, no. jQuery does not have it, but it is possible to do with CSS
[03:18:30] <jetienne> JKarsrud: ok thanks
[03:20:21] <JKarsrud> jetienne:
[03:20:22] <JKarsrud> http://webdesignersdesk.com/2010/05/create-ajax-loading-animation-with-css3/
[03:20:44] <JKarsrud> there are others as well
[03:21:06] <JKarsrud> but that should get you stared I guess. Remember to have a fallback for browsers that doesn't support css animations/transitions
[03:21:48] <jetienne> JKarsrud: i do webgl games... and it has a beautifull sideeffect ... i dont care about old browser :)
[03:21:58] <JKarsrud> good :)
[03:22:03] <jetienne> JKarsrud: thanks for the link css
[03:22:08] <JKarsrud> no problem
[03:23:15] <ravenzz> jetienne you can also change the mouse cursor or use gifs
[03:23:47] <jetienne> ravenzz: there is a mouse cursor which mean "wait" ? which one ?
[03:24:12] <ravenzz> cursor:wait
[03:24:13] <ravenzz> ?
[03:25:40] <jetienne> ravenzz: ugly but simple :) thanks
[03:29:21] <jetienne> http://marblesoccer.com/ click on the camera, and you can see what you helped me build :) the cursor:wait during screenshot upload
[03:29:22] <jetienne> thanks
[03:31:47] <ravenzz> you can also specify an url as cursor iirc
[03:32:38] <poppiez> I want to loop through all elements on a page until the accumulated height exceeds a given value. when an element exceeds the height, it should close all tags currently looped through (and not closed yet) and then open them in another container. does that make sense? heh
[03:33:50] <ravenzz> jetienne and add a loading gif as the h2 bg (Please Wait)
[03:34:18] <ravenzz> with text-indent:-BIGVALUEem/px
[03:34:18] <jetienne> ravenzz: nah it is cool this way. i like the fact i dont have an image
[03:34:26] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[03:34:38] <ravenzz> ok then ;)
[03:34:42] <ravenzz> hello Shwaiil
[03:35:51] <Shwaiil> Q: I'm placing some html on the DOM trough Ajax. On callback I run a script but it's not working or not finding the elements. What can I do ? Thanks
[03:37:02] <ravenzz> ?demo
[03:37:02] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:38:10] <Shwaiil> ravenzz,tks for looking. If I run a hello work on the ajax callback it works, but since I expect to use a script that was not written by me, that validates a form
[03:38:20] <Shwaiil> I didnt used jsfiddle because of the complexity
[03:39:42] <ravenzz> just paste it then, pastie.org
[03:41:10] <Shwaiil> I'm going try to use .getScript and afterwards i'll try to replicate the issue in jsfiddle :)
[03:41:45] <ravenzz> good idea
[03:42:54] <guy> I did $('#myobject').hide(); but then $('#myitem').is(':visible') is still returning true
[03:42:55] <bot-t> (143 hours ago) <sean`> tell guy ping me plz
[03:42:56] <guy> any ideas?
[03:43:02] <Shwaiil> I'm thinking about getScript because the console.log('Hello world'); runs, so, I'm going place the validation script on ajax callback and run
[03:43:31] <guy> sean`: was there something you want?
[03:43:58] <Shwaiil> guy, isnt .hide() change element to display:none
[03:44:19] <deebo> is there some easy trick to getting events from an input field after the user has stopped typing?
[03:44:21] <_druu> guy: just for testing try this:    $('#myobject').hide(function() { console.log($(this).is(':visible'));});
[03:44:25] <guy> well, yes. but I thought ":visible" selector is generic selector to see whether element is visible.
[03:44:29] <Shwaiil> instead of visibility: hidden ?! dunno cant remember
[03:44:43] <Shwaiil> guy, but display:none is diferent then visibility:hidden :X
[03:44:45] <deebo> live search style functionality
[03:44:48] <guy> ..
[03:45:03] <ryrych> hi
[03:45:09] <Shwaiil> when using visibility the element is still there
[03:45:16] <Shwaiil> while display:none, its not
[03:45:43] <Shwaiil> does that make sense guy ? =)
[03:46:05] <sean`> guy, I think that was 'cause I saw you saying 'fuck facebook' and Iwas like, why
[03:46:05] <guy> anyway, _druu I did logic mistake there. It works as it supposed to after all.
[03:46:07] <sean`> but you've explained it
[03:46:40] <guy> oh. I've been emotional. I've started to ignore the whole Facebook thing.
[03:47:23] <ryrych> let’s say I have 3 LIs in a wrapped set (variable); then remove 2 of them using $wrapped.eq(0).remove(); but the same element is removed. Is it cached? How is the easiest way to update the wrappe set?
[03:48:16] <guy> _druu: Shwaiil was partially right. I assumed that setting in css element { display: none; } is going to be the same as .hide() using jQuery. Then I explicitly stated the .hide() using jQuery and :visible started to work as it should.
[03:49:54] <_druu> ah okay :)
[03:50:04] <Shwaiil> ravenzz, are u still there ? http://pastie.org/2846826
[03:50:15] <Shwaiil> I couldnt make it work
[03:51:23] <Gorkyman> what jquery wysiwyg editor do you use lately?
[03:52:13] <Shwaiil> Gorkyman, jwysiwyg for jquery doesnt look bad
[03:52:21] <Shwaiil> i'm not sure abuot the name but is something like that
[03:52:49] <Gorkyman> yeah I was just loking at it... image manager doesnt work in demo though...
[03:53:01] <Shwaiil> Anyone experienced in .ajax that can have a look in my pastie ? I'm trying to solve " I'm placing some html on the DOM trough Ajax. On callback I run a script but it's not working or not finding the elements. "
[03:53:19] <Shwaiil> If I run $(".formToValidate").validate(); on console.log it also works
[03:53:43] <Shwaiil> oh wait i'm not placing in the ajax call back :P but in the live click
[03:53:45] <Shwaiil> damn :P
[03:54:17] <bittyx-work> hi! what's the preferred way of sending post/ajax requests with jquery? so far, i've always been using $.post(...).success(...).error(...); but i've recently read (from a link at the 1.7 release info - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9399 ) that these shouldn't be used anymore
[03:54:44] <bittyx-work> so is  there any "official" or recommended way in which ajax requests should be sent?
[03:58:26] <Shwaiil> not even in the ajax callback this is working :X hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[03:58:48] <sean`> bot-t, tell d4g ping

[04:15:55] <bubersson3> Hi, I have a simple question (or so do I hope). How to call parent object method from within jquery callback method? (example: http://chopapp.com/#u4iahu95 )
[04:21:05] <Shwaiil> bubersson3, clojures ?
[04:21:06] <Shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/
[04:21:37] <Shwaiil> I hope my example helpes, I dont do js for awhile but.. :T
[04:25:16] <Guest63742> is there much difference between 1.6.4 and 1.7 regarding mouseout event?
[04:29:15] <burg> hello. how can i track a click on a parent div, but not inside one of its children?
[04:29:19] <bubersson3> Shwaiil: thanks a lot! :) But I have found another solution...  solved that with var that = this; ...
[04:30:00] <Shwaiil> bubersson3, actually I tryed to do with that, but didnt worked for me, can u show me your example ? =)
[04:30:16] <Shwaiil> I used var self = this;
[04:30:27] <Shwaiil> dont know if its a reserved word, I guess not, also tryed with var me :P
[04:31:38] <Shwaiil> I thought that this would work but didnt :) http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/1/
[04:39:33] <bubersson3> Shwaiil: Now I have tried even other way... http://chopapp.com/#hownvnlw only init method is exposed to outside world
[04:40:24] <Shwaiil> bubersson3, can u solve my exmpl ? =)
[04:40:28] <Shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/1/
[04:41:34] <Shwaiil> nice one :)
[04:45:02] <bubersson3> Shwaiil: http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/2/ ... in this example you don't need to use this / that ... I think
[04:46:55] <Shwaiil> bubersson3, yeah, but how to make that work on that context ? =)
[04:47:25] <quicksilver> what are you expecting 'this' to be, Shwaiil ?
[04:47:41] <Shwaiil> oh found solution http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/4/
[04:47:47] <quicksilver> because it's going to be 'document'
[04:47:55] <quicksilver> since you're inside a document.ready callback.
[04:48:03] <Shwaiil> we just stick the vars on that, thats all
[04:48:14] <quicksilver> you're sticking random vars on document
[04:48:17] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, thats for looking
[04:48:36] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, you're right =)
[04:49:36] <Shwaiil> so the solution would be http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/5/
[04:50:26] <quicksilver> that looks a little more sane.
[04:50:47] <quicksilver> or just var that = { "a" : function() {....}, "b" : function() { .... } }
[04:50:47] <Shwaiil> yup
[04:51:02] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, I was going to ask about that style :)
[04:51:05] <Shwaiil> looks a lot more cleaners
[04:51:16] <Shwaiil> I never used though
[04:51:20] <Shwaiil> but I see alot
[04:52:40] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, much cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/6/
[04:53:03] <Shwaiil> is there a way to init one of this functions on that without calling it explicit ?
[04:53:26] <Trisox> Shwaiil: http://jsfiddle.net/ is cleaner
[04:53:33] <Trisox> minimalistic even ;)
[04:53:34] <Shwaiil> like a initializer or... constructor ?! could I use this term ?!
[04:53:54] <Shwaiil> Trisox, hey ;) ehh your link doesnt have the params
[04:53:58] <Shwaiil> to see your code :X
[04:54:03] <Shwaiil> can u send it again ?
[04:54:08] <Trisox> Shwaiil: emty is cleaner :P
[04:54:18] <Trisox> it was a joke......
[04:54:26] <Trisox> pfff ;D
[04:54:41] <guy_> is there any way to do this?
[04:54:41] <guy_> https://gist.github.com/9ec401e51a743b7be642
[04:54:46] <Shwaiil> oh great http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/7/
[04:54:51] <Shwaiil> we can use init and works just fine :D
[04:55:05] <Shwaiil> ehh no it doesnt
[04:55:28] <Woet> ?doc .append @ guy_
[04:55:29] <bot-t> guy_, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[04:55:56] <quicksilver> Shwaiil: sure. Learn how JS works :P
[04:55:57] <quicksilver> Shwaiil: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
[04:55:59] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, can we have a initializer ?! like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/7/ isntead of http://jsfiddle.net/RWvSA/6/
[04:56:02] <quicksilver> Shwaiil: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/prototype
[04:56:05] <guy_> I cannot write it to a plain string since I am using data() to reference data. I don't want to add it to the actual page DOM either, because that would be bad for performance. I am wondering whether it is therefore possible to create a virtual DOM holder, like where I declared var suggestions_str = $('');
[04:56:14] <quicksilver> Shwaiil: read those two links. And google search for interesting terms within them.
[04:56:31] <Shwaiil> quicksilver, I often do that ;) I've been out of js for awhile
[04:56:58] <guy_> hm. I think the docs actually helped, Woet. Let me try something.
[04:57:01] <Ronnie> i have a problem with the ui.autocomplete function the source as a callback instead of a variable: http://jsfiddle.net/BBmNn/ any help?

[05:05:36] <Aamir> check console http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/BBmNn/1/

[05:16:29] <Logitech> Hello, is there an advantage of using delegate on "click" with a setAttribute() over a document.getElementById('"").setAttribute() which is being called by on onclick in the element itself?
[05:17:32] <guy_> Chetic: I assume no url is set?
[05:17:34] <sweetgrass> PaperBear: <script>var jqVar = <?php echo $phpVar; ?></script> in the head of my page and then accessing that in my script
[05:17:38] <guy_> not sure what do you mean though..
[05:18:29] <PaperBear> sweetgrass, that's what I'm trying to do - but I can't seem to access it from the jquery function
[05:18:40] <guy_> sweetgrass: that's disgusting. use <script type="text/javascript" /* is it that hard? */ > var jqVar = <?=json_encode(array('your' => 'data'));?>; </script>
[05:19:22] <mats_> what's the acceptable size of the main css file? is 100kb too large? :)
[05:19:36] <mats_> wrong channel haha, but yeah, maybe you can give me a good answer too
[05:19:52] <sweetgrass> mats_: That's HUGE
[05:20:03] <guy_> mats_: it shouldn't be 100kb. anyway, it doesn't matter – after it is loaded once, it is cached.
[05:20:30] <mats_> hehe, it's not that large yet. just so i know what not to do
[05:20:31] <Chetic> guy_: I'm getting a json file with ajax and the error response doesn't seem to contain the filename anywhere (yes I'm a newb)
[05:20:59] <guy_> Chetic: we don't support 3rd party scripts.
[05:21:30] <sweetgrass> mats_: depends what the project is I guess.
[05:21:38] <PaperBear> sweetgrass, I just realised it has nothing to do with my variable declaration, and everything to do with me being a spaz
[05:21:51] <Chetic> guy_: this is purely about jquery's ajax
[05:22:04] <mats_> sweetgrass: yeah, it was only 12 kb right now. so. i won't ever reach 100 :) maybe 20 in the end
[05:22:40] <guy_> Chetic: no, if it was, jquery would default to error() event.
[05:22:41] <sweetgrass> mats_: :)
[05:22:42] <guy_> callback*
[05:23:33] <sweetgrass> mats_: the one I am working on at the mo is 85kb and that's for a complex site
[05:24:02] <guy_> sweetgrass, mats_: please refer to #web or #css
[05:24:07] <mats_> sweetgrass: so they can get quite large then :)
[05:24:18] <mats_> guy_: yeah, i asked in the wrong window. sorry
[05:24:18] <sweetgrass> guy_: sorry.
[05:24:44] <sweetgrass> guy_: just making inappropriate small talk. :/

[05:46:21] <speyburn_> ok :) just asking cos i might use it in future or atleast need it :)
[05:46:24] <MACscr> something like that would work
[05:46:28] <MACscr> yep
[05:56:39] <guy> how do I convert $('<div class="test"></div>') to html?
[05:57:07] <guy> say I do $('<div />').addClass('test'); now how to get <div class="test"></div> out of it?
[06:02:46] <Distilled> guy: $('<div class="test"></div>').html()
[06:02:58] <guy> That's what I thought. didn't work.
[06:03:08] <Distilled> oh, it would only return the innerHtml
[06:03:22] <guy> yes.
[06:03:40] <Distilled> try $('urhtmlz').get(0) or $('urhtmlz')[0]
[06:03:42] <guy> $('<div />').append( $('<div class="test"></div>').html() ).html()
[06:03:52] <guy> was the quickest (dirty) way I've discovered.
[06:04:41] <guy> anyway, not something I need anymore. I decided to stay with .data() instead.
[06:07:21] <guy> Pretty cool simple script. Cool mostly because it doesn't use over-weight jquery-ui (as all the alternatives I've found while searching for a pre-made script) and properly handles AJAX (neither of the scripts I've looked did). Few more things left to implement, though. http://sinonimai.lt/sutrumpinimu-rodykle.html Try typing in the red box.
[06:09:09] <onip> hi all. I'm using a custom 'click' handler for some anchors in my page. The function gets an html fragment via ajax and replaces some content on the page. the problem is that, despite using $().on('click',...) my handler isn't applied to anchors in appended html. some hints?
[06:09:53] <guy> onip: use either delegate() (preferred) or live() instead of bind().
[06:10:51] <onip> guy, I've used on() and not bind() and while browsing apis it says that delegate is superseded by on. Is there a fault in docs then?
[06:11:08] <guy> em. let me check.
[06:11:13] <onip> will try delegate() anyway
[06:11:54] <guy> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[06:12:01] <onip> exactly
[06:12:02] <guy> ow. wow. that's something new to me.
[06:12:56] <onip> but the handler isn't called after the first time... the event doesn't look like "a live one"
[06:13:11] <guy> I see.
[06:14:11] <mattyh88> hey, does anyone here know a good jquery plugin for this effect on: http://rouxatparliamentsquare.co.uk/
[06:15:39] <guy> I don't see any effect there, mattyh88.
[06:16:46] <mattyh88> guy: i mean the slider for the photos :)
[06:17:34] <mattyh88> i know i've seen the plugin somewhere before but can't remember how it's called
[06:17:41] <mattyh88> cuz i recognize the arrow icons
[06:18:21] <guy> maybe it is just me, but I find 3rd parameter being "data" highly unreasonable... [.on( events [, selector] [, data], handler )]
[06:18:33] <guy> ups, that was meant to jquery-dev.
[06:20:35] <bfred> how do I call fn() after two events have been called?
[06:20:56] <bfred> I'm trying to understand deferrers but maybe there's an easier way to do it
[06:21:01] <bfred> *deferreds
[06:23:01] <guy> onip: p.s. I just tested on() and it looks "live".
[06:33:53] <JKarsrud> onip: you need to specify a special syntax to make it behave like live
[06:36:02] <Chetic> what could cause a .js-file with this code to fire the ajax twice?: $(function() { $.ajax({blabla}) });
[06:36:32] <Chetic> blabla is a proper ajax setup ofc
[06:36:35] <timing> Chetic: maybe it's in a loop?
[06:36:50] <timing> or the js file is included twice? the function arround it is called twice?
[06:37:05] <timing> the ajax call is doing a redirect and you think there are two calls?
[06:37:20] <Chetic> well there are two calls
[06:37:30] <timing> both the same?
[06:37:39] <Chetic> yeah
[06:37:43] <Chetic> no loop
[06:42:27] <alx-> hello, im trying to convert 11/11/2011 to Nov 11, 2011. is there a good plugin that does this?
[06:46:29] <FleetFox> Is there something really light for radio button costumization. I see there is a lot choices but i don't have a time to go thru all of them
[06:49:21] <jubby> Hey all. Anyone know if the $(document).ready function can be executed more than once? I have an inline script calling it and a sourced script calling it. Do these conflict?
[06:49:59] <FleetFox> if they are not nested there is no issues
[06:50:06] <FleetFox> i'm using it all over the place
[06:51:08] <geekbri> you can call document.ready as many times as you want as long as you dont mind the mild performance hit :)
[06:51:16] <jubby> FleetFox: Do they execute sequentially? Like a cascade?
[06:52:01] <jwa_> hi
[06:52:01] <jubby> geekbri: I'm all about mild performance hits. JK JK
[06:52:49] <FleetFox> jubby: i'm not sure they may be paralel i don't know anything about javascript or jquery
[06:52:53] <FleetFox> thats why i'm here
[06:53:50] <jwa_> may i ask a question about the .keyup() and the ":input" selector?
[06:53:52] <jubby> geekbri: Do you know if document ready is executed sequentially or in parallel?
[06:54:06] <jubby> FleetFox: Thx anyway =)
[06:54:41] <onip> JKarsrud, can you explain that? I'm using $(_selector_).on('click', function(event){...})
[06:54:43] <geekbri> jubby: they all get executed when the document is ready, in the order that they were attached i believe.
[06:55:08] <geekbri> jubby: so whatever order you call them in is the order they will get executed in.
[06:55:13] <onip> obiouvsly under a $(document).ready(function($){...})
[06:55:37] <JKarsrud> onip: see ?on
[06:55:38] <bot-t> onip, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:55:54] <jwa_> ok
[06:56:07] <jwa_> i think my problem is solved :)
[06:56:30] <qwerty57> anyone familiar with orbit plugin? how can I check if it has been loaded?
[06:56:58] <onip> JKarsrud, that's the way I'm doing (or at least I think). I've read that page before writing the code
[06:57:05] <jubby> geekbri: K, I think my script is calling a dependency in the other script that isnt available yet
[06:57:32] <JKarsrud> onip: if you want it to behave like live, you have to do $(document).on('click', '_selector_', handler);
[06:57:53] <ericincoldohio> I have a question about creating a plugin, I'm reading http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring "The Basics" example...why is "this.each" used..then $(this).height is used
[06:58:05] <ericincoldohio> is there a difference?
[06:58:28] <onip> JKarsrud, oh, ok. I think I've missed that part then. going through doc paga again. thanks for your patience :)
[06:58:41] <onip> s/paga/page
[06:59:11] <JKarsrud> onip: if you see the docst for live() bind() and delegate() now, you'll see examples of how to use on to do the same behaviour
[06:59:29] <geekbri> jubby: check what order you are loading your scripts in, make sure those are all loaded before jquery
[07:00:40] <JKarsrud> onip basically: $(selector).on(event, handler) == bind(), $(document).on(event, selector, handler) == live() and $(scope).on(event, selector, handler) == delegate
[07:00:42] <jubby> geekbri: You mean after jquery? My scripts are dependent on jquery, so they would ocome after right?
[07:00:56] <geekbri> jubby: your scripts yes, but i meant if you were loading other libraries
[07:01:09] <geekbri> jubby: say for example underscore.js or backbone.js you'd want to load those before jquery.
[07:01:57] <onip> JKarsrud, ok, got it. I really misunderstood that then. thanks again :)
[07:02:06] <JKarsrud> No worries :)
[07:02:30] <JKarsrud> it is an api change, so it's not self explanatory at first :)
[07:03:35] <onip> JKarsrud, I've used jquery some years ago and so I didn't pay attention to it assuming that new "on()" == old "live()"
[07:04:10] <JKarsrud> no, it's new for all event binding, eliminating the need for three different methods to bind events
[07:04:29] <JKarsrud> :)
[07:04:38] <JKarsrud> it makes event handling so much faster too =)
[07:05:06] <JKarsrud> this blog post explains it: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[07:05:18] <JKarsrud> if you're interested
[07:11:28] <richardjprice> if i have both jquery and jquery mobile srcs in a html page, and am listening for a form submit, would the event be caught twice? once by each library?
[07:11:34] <andrew9183> $.get('/image-info', url: ImageSource,function(response) { alert('hello'); },'json');
[07:11:44] <andrew9183> is there something syntactically wrong with that
[07:11:48] <andrew9183> says missing )
[07:12:55] <richardjprice> andrew9183: looks wrong - wouldnt it normally have {url: blah, something: blah}
[07:13:06] <andrew9183> yeah i had that, but still had the same thing
[07:13:17] <JKarsrud> andrew9183: just remove url :
[07:13:40] <JKarsrud> ahh, no, it's a parameter, right
[07:13:52] <JKarsrud> ?get
[07:13:52] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

[07:15:54] <JKarsrud> andrew9183: $.get('/image-info', { url: ImageSource }, function() {}, 'json');
[07:15:54] <andrew9183> but thanks for the look :)
[07:15:58] <JKarsrud> ah, ok :)
[07:16:14] <andrew9183> netbeans is sometimes trouble!
[07:16:14] <JKarsrud> Time to get an editor with some good syntax highlighting maybe?
[07:16:18] <JKarsrud> heh

[07:18:36] <VeXii> anyone know of a good linux editor? thinking about giving gVim a shoot
[07:20:16] <FleetFox> VeXii look at sublime text 2
[07:20:32] <FleetFox> gvim is too hardcore to me
[07:20:36] <VeXii> sure thing
[07:21:04] <VeXii> dont have a computer yet. but realy cba using money on a OS when i buy a computer :p
[07:21:42] <bbrandon> cba = can't be arsed?
[07:22:08] <FleetFox> yes but it still makes no sense
[07:23:09] <bbrandon> i live in california, took me a little white to figure that out. never heard it before
[07:23:15] <bbrandon> while*
[07:24:30] <FleetFox> it has nothing to do with where you live :P it's common abreviation in certain cricles
[07:24:43] <bbrandon> which circles are these?
[07:24:45] <VeXii> g33k circles :D
[07:24:57] <bbrandon> i wonder where i've been
[07:25:01] <FleetFox> more like teen gamers
[07:25:42] <VeXii> pfff
[07:25:52] <bbrandon> VeXii are you a teen gamer
[07:25:54] <bbrandon> ?
[07:25:58] <FleetFox> so is this expression
[07:26:00] <FleetFox> =D
[07:26:09] <VeXii> i where some years ago not to seriuse thou
[07:26:14] <VeXii> used irc alot thou
[07:26:46] <bbrandon> why can't you afford an OS? good investment there
[07:27:20] <FleetFox> learn opensource oss. good investment
[07:27:21] <VeXii> well. windows makes me feel abit ripped of
[07:27:36] <VeXii> and i dont wanner/have the money for apple products
[07:27:40] <VeXii> never ever more!
[07:28:17] <VeXii> i just need a box where i can ssh arund and write some code + surf/stream movies
[07:28:28] <Prot> question: whats the whole (function($) {})(jQuery) thing for? is it to prevent error or global variables or something?
[07:29:00] <erichynds> Prot: to prevent global leakage, and ensure $ always references jQuery
[07:29:30] <VeXii> and to delay execution to after document.ready
[07:29:47] <Prot> er wait, how does that delay?
[07:30:11] <VeXii> sets up event handlers to after the dom is ready
[07:30:14] <crab> it doesn't delay
[07:30:29] <Prot> you'd have to explicitly delay it with ready right?
[07:30:39] <JKarsrud> VeXii: uhm, no
[07:30:51] <crab> prot: it has nothing to do with any delay
[07:30:57] <Prot> didn't think so
[07:30:59] <JKarsrud> there's nothing there that triggers a document ready
[07:31:04] <danheberden> Vexii you're confusing DOMContentReady and an IIFE
[07:31:16] <Prot> as far as global leakage, you're just talking about preventing globals for the sake of keeping the dom clean of them right?
[07:31:20] <JKarsrud> it's an IIFE used as a closure
[07:31:21] <Prot> i mean, theres no other purpose right?
[07:31:30] <erichynds> no
[07:31:37] <Prot> k got it
[07:31:37] <erichynds> keep your window object clean
[07:31:42] <erichynds> nothing to do with DOM
[07:31:49] <Prot> i meant window, not dom
[07:31:50] <VeXii> ahh yeah sorry looked like it where starting whith a $ aswell >_<
[07:31:51] <JKarsrud> everyone likes clean windows :)
[07:31:53] <erichynds> kkkkkkkkk
[07:32:04] <danheberden> e.g. $(function(){ /* i run on doc ready */ }); and (function($){ /* i run right way, but i'm not global bitches - also i can use $ as jQuery no matter WAT*/ })(jQuery);
[07:32:17] <JKarsrud> danheberden: well put
[07:32:26] <danheberden> JKarsrud twss
[07:32:32] <VeXii> yes my bad ^^
[07:32:35] <Prot> oh, so you can do $( for running on doc ready?
[07:32:43] <danheberden> Prot yes, but imho it's awful
[07:32:51] <danheberden> $( document ).ready( fn ) is so much more descriptive
[07:32:51] <Prot> but $ might not be jQuery, so you should still do a closure
[07:32:58] <Prot> got it
[07:33:17] <danheberden> and you can do jQuery( document ).ready( function( $ ){  });
[07:33:19] <JKarsrud> $.fn.ready(function() {}) ftw!
[07:33:30] <erichynds> that's the money closure right there
[07:34:17] <danheberden> but better to have (function($){ $(document).ready( fn ); /* the rest of your shit that can be created before docReadwy */ })( jQuery );
[07:34:31] <m_e> i am trying to use such a search box: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/search/index.html but sadly i cant apply any event on it
[07:34:33] <Prot> also if I want to put all my various objects in a 'namespace', I should do $.fn.mynamespace.something = ... right?
[07:34:38] <Prot> trying to brush up on the good habbits
[07:34:53] <danheberden> Prot - unless you're making a plugin, i'd recommend not putting shit on $
[07:34:55] <danheberden> make your own
[07:35:03] <m_e> i tried it with: $('.test').click(function() {... and with: $(".test").bind( "change", function(event, ui) {
[07:35:34] <Prot> alright, thx for the help
[07:35:42] <danheberden> like window.myCoolAsHellApp = { makeShit: function(){}, handleSomething: function(){} };
[07:36:48] <FleetFox> danheberden you should write tutorials or something i really like your way of expression
[07:37:14] <JKarsrud> FleetFox: he does :)
[07:37:29] <m_e> this is the code i have. where the event is never triggered: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/506311/
[07:37:39] <danheberden> not as much as i'd like, tho - FleetFox i have a blog post going live today you might like
[07:37:47] <danheberden> it'll be on www.bocoup.com
[07:38:12] <FleetFox> Okay. Thanks for heads up
[07:38:44] <JKarsrud> m_e: Works just fine here
[07:39:14] <JKarsrud> except for change, which is never triggered from an input iirc
[07:39:25] <danheberden> also you're binding to #test
[07:39:29] <danheberden> which doesn't look like it exists
[07:39:41] <danheberden> since the input is id="searc-basic"
[07:39:50] <JKarsrud> and the UI parameter isn't really anything that exists in jquery, so I think you're confused about jQuery UI in there too
[07:40:26] <JKarsrud> m_e: annoying little fiddle, but it works; http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/nsqVn/
[07:41:29] <m_e> JKarsrud: i uploaded my test here: http://unikoch.de/lite/
[07:41:39] <m_e> there it doesnt work :/
[07:42:46] <JKarsrud> ah, then it might be a problem with loading both jquery AND jquery mobile
[07:43:52] <JKarsrud> not that I know anything about mobile at all
[07:44:48] <m_e> damn
[07:46:19] <JKarsrud> works from the console, so I guess not
[07:46:47] <JKarsrud> oh wait.. Have you tried .live()
[07:47:24] <m_e> what you mean with .live()?
[07:47:27] <JKarsrud> .live('click', function() { alert("jo"); });
[07:47:42] <JKarsrud> $('.test').live('click', function() { alert("jo"); });
[07:48:15] <m_e> that works
[07:48:46] <m_e> on the other hand it also works if i include the minimized jquerymobile source code from a js file directly on the server
[07:48:50] <m_e> i am confused now
[07:49:07] <m_e> what does that .live do exactly?
[07:49:20] <m_e> waits until everything is rdy?
[07:49:50] <JKarsrud> ?live
[07:49:51] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:50:09] <m_e> "in the future" must be the key
[07:50:28] <JKarsrud> yup
[07:50:42] <m_e> thanks for your help :)
[07:50:56] <JKarsrud> no problem
[07:51:14] <Iarfen> Hi
[07:51:15] <bot-t> (180 hours ago) <ryanneufeld> tell Iarfen you might have a problem on your server side, chances are you're hitting the wrong url
[07:51:30] <airportyh> m_e: it listens for events on the document object
[07:51:50] <Iarfen> when I use val() to get the value of a checkbox, how it is returned in the two cases??
[07:52:16] <airportyh> m_e: where events eventually bubble up (although not all events)
[07:52:58] <JKarsrud> Iarfen: it doesn't, you need to see ?:checked
[07:52:58] <bot-t> Iarfen, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[07:53:15] <Iarfen> jKarsrud: xDDD Ok, ty!!
[07:54:19] <Iarfen> jKarsrud: I need to know if the input is checked
[07:54:31] <Iarfen> jKarsrud: not to select checked inputs
[07:54:42] <JKarsrud> ?is
[07:54:43] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/

[08:06:13] <jwmann> I'm working on this website http://restaurant.pinnacle-media.com, I'm using jScroll on the element ".sidebar .section" but it's not working quite as intended. I've managed to produce what's supposed to be the desired result. If I make #main have a fixed height of let's say 3000px and I make the element #sidebar-second height be 100%; I get the desired effect. Does anybody know what I could to get this effect whilst keeping my layout
[08:10:06] <aram535> Hi, I'm trying to do a autocomplete via 1 input's val(), but fill in 4 input fields with the json.  I can't seem to figure out how to parse the json.
[08:11:00] <cybersholt> aram535, do u have it on jsfiddle?
[08:11:13] <aram535> I'm building it right now
[08:12:48] <cybersholt> aram535, heres a little bit that i use http://jsfiddle.net/z9mRy/
[08:13:47] <aram535> ok just with that -- how does $.each split i and j?   I have 4 fields coming in, n1..4.
[08:14:16] <cybersholt> key / value pairs
[08:14:26] <cybersholt> just like in php
[08:14:32] <aram535> oooh, ok, so if you have 4 k/v pairs they come as an array?
[08:15:19] <cybersholt> with each yep
[08:15:42] <cybersholt> http://jsfiddle.net/z9mRy/1/ shows my json string
[08:16:34] <aram535> sorry let me make that more clear, I have: [{"id":"4","lastName":"A","firstName":"Ak","phone":"+111945","email":"foo@foo.com"},{"id":"167","lastName":"B","firstName":"Bc","phone":"20364933","email":"foo@foo2.com"}]
[08:16:49] <aram535> I have 2 or more rows coming in, and each row has 4 k/v pairs
[08:17:02] <aram535> 5 actually
[08:17:28] <aram535> so I'm trying to fill in fn, ls, phone and email into 4 input fields
[08:17:51] <cybersholt> just play around with the each function i dont have a key on mine so its autoincriment
[08:18:08] <aram535> k, thank you very much that helped
[08:18:15] <cybersholt> but if u do the same it will come in like key id val 4
[08:18:22] <cybersholt> np man hope it leps
[08:18:54] <cybersholt> each will go over the whole string for ya then you just got to match it up to what your workin with
[08:19:08] <aram535> yeah I was able to fill in the input field with 1,2 ... couldn't figure out how to pull out the other keys
[08:19:14] <aram535> but I think I'm on the right track now
[08:19:47] <cybersholt> kool kool hope it dont give ya a headache like it did be oh be careful for stray commas!
[08:20:55] <cybersholt> Anybody know a good google checkout script with subscriptions?
[08:20:56] <aram535> One more question -- I'm assuming your $.getJSON is a function that you're calling from autocomplete?
[08:21:26] <cybersholt> it comes from a sql db
[08:21:36] <cybersholt> for low inventory
[08:21:39] <cybersholt> :)
[08:21:40] <aram535> k
[08:22:48] <cybersholt> Anybody know a good google checkout script the does subscriptions?

[08:34:04] <SoulRaven> how i call a function using callback method
[08:34:44] <SoulRaven> i want to define de function that i want to call as an atribute
[08:36:43] <lenswipe> hey guys
[08:37:58] <lenswipe> im trying to find an element where the content of the element is "Select"
[08:38:02] <lenswipe>     $('table tr th').find().text('Select').hide();
[08:38:04] <lenswipe> im using that
[08:38:15] <lenswipe> problem is, its hiding the entire table row for some reason
[08:38:40] <cybersholt> did u try and give it and id
[08:42:24] <antti_s> lenswipe: currently you're setting all of the th elements' text to "Select" and hiding them
[08:42:36] <antti_s> ?:contains @ lenswipe
[08:42:36] <bot-t> lenswipe, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[08:44:11] <antti_s> lenswipe: ^use that in your selector, or use jQuery's .filter() method... or just give the element an id or class or something
[08:44:38] <lenswipe> $('table tr th').contains('Select').hide();
[08:44:44] <lenswipe> like that?
[08:45:19] <lenswipe> i have a radio button in my table and im managing to hide that using $(this).find('input[type="radio"]').parent().hide();
[08:45:31] <lenswipe> however i would like to hide the column heading for the radio button column as well
[08:45:44] <lenswipe> problem is, its not always in the same position in all of my tables so i cant use eq(4) or whatever
[08:46:47] <JKarsrud> SoulRaven: what do you mean?
[08:46:49] <mats_> how can i remove everything except a specific word? i've used remove(':contains("Stockholm")');, but what if i only want to display Stockholm instead?
[08:46:54] <JKarsrud> like how you define a callback?
[08:47:24] <antti_s> lenswipe: no, like $('th:contains("Select")')...
[08:47:29] <lenswipe> ok
[08:53:14] <mats_> and how can i remove two words? Let's say Stockholm and Gothenburg?
[08:53:32] <ravenzz> use replace
[08:54:06] <airportyh> ?not
[08:54:07] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[08:54:35] <mats_> will replace work no this? jQuery('#city tbody').remove(':contains("Stockholm")');
[08:54:45] <mats_> thanks airportyh
[08:55:03] <airportyh> mats_: sure

[09:06:36] <bot-t> (1 hour 39 mins ago) <imjoshdean> tell ajpiano Spotify.app wat.

[09:08:09] <Whirl3d> I'm registered, thanks. And I have grouped my nick with my registration per those examples (did it yesterday and confirmed it today). Still no help.
[09:08:27] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: but you aren't authed
[09:08:56] <Whirl3d> Never got the auth message. <-checking spam
[09:09:01] <ajpiano> that's not
[09:09:05] <ajpiano> what i'm talking about
[09:09:12] <Pilate> /ns identify yourpassword
[09:09:14] <ajpiano> you have to do /msg nickserv identify nick pw
[09:09:37] <ajpiano> its the diff between having an account on a website and actually logging in to it
[09:10:09] <jwm> your password is pw ajpiano????
[09:10:25] <ajpiano> yep
[09:10:28] <Phelps> when was 1.7 released ?
[09:10:32] <ajpiano> Phelps: last week
[09:10:47] <jwm> 1.7 crashes my internets
[09:10:47] <Phelps> could that be causing all the problems I'm seeing around the web ?
[09:10:51] <jwm> all my browsers closed immediately
[09:11:03] <ajpiano> Phelps: no
[09:11:05] <Whirl3d> sorry, did both of those today--don't waste any more time on this, it's off topic. I'll figure it out. Thanks again.
[09:11:08] <Phelps> a lot of sites that worked before, do not work now
[09:11:15] <Phelps> or work, but with some problems
[09:11:18] <ajpiano> lol.
[09:11:32] <Iszak> maybe it's because your browser sucks?
[09:11:32] <jwm> maybe you need to reinstall your netscape 3.0 install
[09:11:39] <Phelps> its Chrome, so doubtful
[09:11:45] <jwm> I hear communicator 4 came out
[09:11:48] <Iszak> or maybe you have an extension that's breaking it.
[09:12:12] <jwm> did you inspect element and look at the console
[09:12:12] <Phelps> i think 1.7 broke things, and since so many sites use the google CDN, they rolled out 1.7 not even knowing it
[09:12:15] <Phelps> thats what I think
[09:12:27] <Iszak> w
[09:12:31] <Iszak> that's their fault
[09:12:32] <ajpiano> while that is an interesting theory
[09:12:36] <solocio> hey
[09:12:41] <Phelps> no extension, it happens in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
[09:12:54] <ajpiano> we cannot address a problem like "a bunch of different websites seem quirky"
[09:12:56] <ajpiano> here.
[09:13:01] <solocio> does anyone know regex for european telephone numbers? (spaces, +, 49, numbers, / )
[09:13:41] <Iszak> how many numbers?
[09:13:52] <JackBauer24> solocio: try here http://regexlib.com but it's quite easy to write it yourself
[09:14:07] <Iszak> /\s+\+49\s*\d{6,10}\b/ could work, needs to be tuned/
[09:14:18] <Phelps> You're all correct and I'm just an idiot (obviously the best conclusion), thanks for the great help, good day.
[09:14:37] <solocio> @Iszak is +49 optional?
[09:14:48] <ajpiano> well that waws confusing
[09:14:59] <Iszak> /\s+(\+49\s*)?\d{6,10}\b/ now it is
[09:15:01] <solocio> @JackBauer24 i'll never understand regex. sorry..
[09:15:11] <solocio> let me try this! @Iszak
[09:15:31] <solocio> currently i have: /^((\+[0-9]{2,4}([ -][0-9]+?[ -]| ?\([0-9]+?\) ?))|(\(0[0-9 ]+?\) ?)|(0[0-9]+? ?( |-|\/) ?))([0-9]+?[ \/-]?)+?[0-9]$/
[09:15:37] <solocio> but it doesn't accept spaces
[09:15:57] <solocio> space = optional!
[09:16:32] <labratt> can anyone tell me a better way to duplicate this slider http://jsfiddle.net/labratt/Jd4CH/8/
[09:17:20] <solocio> @Iszak Could you make the space optional?
[09:17:33] <necromancer> anyone here into PJAX?
[09:17:34] <JackBauer24> labratt: make it as a jQuery function
[09:17:46] <necromancer> if so, how does the jquery.pjax plugin fall back to older browsers?
[09:17:57] <JackBauer24> labratt: I mean jQuery plugin
[09:18:05] <labratt> i have no idea how…. i just figured this out...
[09:18:12] <solocio> btw, jQuery 1.7 damaged my nivo-slider - some animations stop at half
[09:18:29] <ajpiano> solocio: there was a bug with percentage width animations in jquery 1.7
[09:18:30] <SoulRaven> is it ok to use jQuery.Callbacks() to call a function inside a function ?
[09:18:35] <ajpiano> it will be fixed in 1.7.1
[09:18:36] <Iszak> solocio: no,
[09:18:46] <ajpiano> percentage* animations
[09:18:57] <kborchers> ajpiano: my car has been sputtering since 1.7 came out. i suspect that is the cause. FIX IT!
[09:19:12] <JackBauer24> labratt: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:19:29] <solocio> @Iszak Please be so kind :)
[09:19:33] <Iszak> no
[09:19:41] <ajpiano> kborchers: drive it off a cliff
[09:19:51] <Iszak> /\s*(\+49\s*)?\d{6,10}\b/
[09:20:01] <Iszak> I don't know how long European numbers are, I need more clarification.
[09:21:35] <zkirill> Does a draggable element know when it's been successfully dropped or do I have to code that in myself?
[09:22:32] <solocio> @Iszak I need a Regex which has optional: spaces, +, / and consists of number 0-9
[09:22:39] <Iszak> no
[09:22:41] <solocio> doesn't matter how long the number is..
[09:22:43] <Iszak> go to #regex
[09:24:30] <solocio> you think I'll meet someone more friendly? - it's always give and take, I give in php/ruby channels and I would take in javascript channels - but maybe you'll be in a php channel one day..
[09:25:35] <ajpiano> typically people are more willing to help with SpecificThing in #SpecificThing :)

[09:27:30] <SoulRaven> please help me, i have a script, a litle big script, http://pastebin.com/QRgLZfhg and i don't know how to make a callback from that script, i have write the function to callback, but i don't know how to call the function that is defined in attrributes
[09:28:12] <SoulRaven> i never work with callbacks in this matter, i don't know how to call any function when the callback is call
[09:32:02] <SoulRaven> please help me, i have a script, a litle big script, http://pastebin.com/QRgLZfhg and i don't know how to make a callback from that script, i have write the function to callback, but i don't know how to call the function that is defined in attrributes
[09:32:04] <SoulRaven> i never work with callbacks in this matter, i don't know how to call any function when the callback is call
[09:33:25] <PPaul> i have a fieldset tag that i'm trying to query... i use: $(html).find('fieldset') but it returns []
[09:34:08] <rroelofs> SoulRaven: you refer to the callback just like any other function
[09:34:56] <rroelofs> if it is attached to an object you might need the object name or 'this'  as in this.callback()
[09:35:19] <Mkop> is there a preferred way to namespace utility functions used in a plugin?
[09:35:54] <SoulRaven> rroelofs: how, because the function is an attribute of ana abject, look in my paste
[09:36:07] <SoulRaven> 'callback': ''
[09:36:30] <rroelofs> I saw.  an attribute can be a function.  you use it just like any other attribute
[09:36:44] <rroelofs> when you want  it to run, just add ()
[09:37:30] <rroelofs> so this.callback() is the same as this['callback']()
[09:38:00] <PPaul> i guess i should query the form, not fieldset
[09:38:11] <SoulRaven> on console.log(setting.callback); i get function alert() { [native code] }
[09:39:16] <rroelofs> but when you type console.log(setting.callback()) the altert hppens
[09:39:43] <rroelofs> a function is just like any other variable
[09:40:16] <rroelofs> that's why javascript is considered a 'functional' language.  It looks like java or C but it isn't
[09:41:37] <SoulRaven> rroelofs: i work link this:
[09:41:37] <SoulRaven>             var callback = setting.callback;
[09:41:37] <SoulRaven>             if(typeof(setting.callback) === 'function'){
[09:41:37] <SoulRaven>                 callback();
[09:41:37] <SoulRaven>             }
[09:41:50] <SoulRaven> but is fine like this?
[09:41:55] <PPaul> SoulRaven, learn about functional programming
[09:42:00] <PPaul> ;)
[09:42:14] <Mkop> SoulRaven: why the typechecking? do you plan on setting.callback to anything else?
[09:42:44] <PPaul> SoulRaven, your code doesn't make much sense
[09:43:04] <SoulRaven> no, just execute the function from attribute
[09:43:16] <rgrthtcmdr> Anyone know how to always prepend a 'prefix' value if it is not already there in a text input?
[09:43:25] <Mkop> setting.callback()
[09:43:55] <Mkop> rgrthtcmdr: have you tried yet?
[09:44:27] <SoulRaven> Mkop: is not working with setting.callback(), i get Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[09:44:42] <Mkop> what is the value of setting.callback?
[09:45:16] <rgrthtcmdr> I have not tried using callbacks yet.
[09:45:19] <rgrthtcmdr> Will look into it.
[09:45:25] <SoulRaven> from console.log : function alert() { [native code] }
[09:46:12] <danheberden> rgrthtcmdr i think you might have confused the chat directed to SoulRaven with what you're trying to accomplish
[09:46:25] <Mkop> yes, indeed.
[09:47:01] <rgrthtcmdr> For sure.
[09:47:13] <Mkop> SoulRaven: try setting.callback=function() {alert('hello')};
[09:47:19] <Mkop> setting.callback();
[09:48:31] <innopar> Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong here? http://pastie.org/2848306 I am just trying to use getJSON to post the most recent blog posts on my page
[09:48:35] <SoulRaven> is working
[09:48:35] <danheberden> ?eval var prepend = function( wat ) { return /^nou-/.test( wat ) ? wat : 'nou-' + wat; }; [ prepend( "omg" ), prepend( "nou-dude!" ) ];
[09:48:36] <bot-t> danheberden: ["nou-omg", "nou-dude!"]
[09:48:43] <danheberden> rgrthtcmdr ^
[09:49:35] <Mkop> danheberden: do you really consider that to be a newbie-understandable snippet??
[09:49:40] <rgrthtcmdr> Right on!  This makes sense.
[09:49:55] <danheberden> Mkop ^
[09:50:25] <rgrthtcmdr> thanks danheberden!
[09:50:30] <PPaul> how do i query for a form tag in jquery?
[09:50:35] <SoulRaven> Mkop; what is the next step now?
[09:50:55] <danheberden> and no, not really Mkop - just showing a way
[09:50:56] <Mkop> I have not the slightest clue, since I don't know what you're trying to do
[09:51:07] <Gorkyman> anyone recommending a good form validation for jquery?
[09:51:34] <Gorkyman> I need something small :)
[09:51:36] <Mkop> if you're trying to show a way, use if statements rather than ternary operator. and str.startsWith() rather than regex.
[09:51:49] <Mkop> (at least in my opinion)
[09:51:58] <PPaul> $(myhtml).find('form') is finding my form, but not returning it's nested elements
[09:52:14] <SoulRaven> Mkop: i just want to execute any function defined in the attribute "callback"
[09:52:40] <PPaul> soulRaven thing.callback()
[09:52:42] <innopar> Gokyman: I like LiveValidation http://livevalidation.com/examples
[09:52:50] <Mkop> setting.callback() should do that. I assume that initially you were getting an error because setting.callback had a weird value
[09:53:18] <SoulRaven> the value of callback is 'callback': alert
[09:53:47] <innopar> Am I dumb? Shouldn't this work? http://pastie.org/2848306
[09:54:07] <Gorkyman> innociv: I'll check it out
[09:54:39] <Gorkyman> eh..
[09:54:41] <Gorkyman> innopar: :)
[09:54:42] <mike281> hello
[09:54:57] <Pilate> no innopar
[09:55:10] <Pilate> you need to use JSONP for that, im guessing
[09:55:17] <Mkop> SoulRaven: post a jsfiddle. there's nothing more I can help with until I actually see what you're doing.
[09:55:24] <Pilate> or are you coming from that domain?
[09:56:06] <innopar> pulate: I am trying to pull from that domain which is already formatted as JSON
[09:56:25] <innopar> pilate: I am trying to pull from that domain which is already formatted as JSON
[09:56:26] <Pilate> right but you cant parse that result because youre making a cross domain ajax request
[09:56:31] <jwm> it looks like firefox scrolls before dom is ready for hash anchors
[09:56:32] <mike281> hope someone can help me, why is it that $('a').click() is not fired if I have $(document).one('mousedown')?
[09:56:57] <danheberden> mike281 mousedown != click
[09:57:21] <PPaul> when i do this $('<fieldset>',$(html)) .. i get [
[09:57:22] <PPaul> <fieldset>​</fieldset>​
[09:57:22] <PPaul> ]   my fieldset has stuff in it in my html var, but not in my query...
[09:57:34] <innopar> pilate: Do you think I might be able to do it with parseJSON?
[09:57:54] <danheberden> PPaul you're telling jq to make a fieldset
[09:58:00] <AZaytsev> How do I select something, where attribute "data-disable-with" is not present? I tried $("a[data-disable-with='']"), null, undefined, false but it doesn't work.
[09:58:17] <danheberden> $( 'fieldset', $( html ) ) might work better
[09:58:22] <mike281> danheberden I mean if I have those two events defined, the click event for 'a' does not fire
[09:59:36] <PPaul> danheberden that returns []
[09:59:36] <danheberden> AZaytsev $( 'a' ).not( '[data-disabled-with]' ) or $( 'a:not("[data-disabled-with]")' )
[09:59:39] <Gorkyman> innopar: is there a way to auto validate fields that belongs to a form?
[09:59:52] <Gorkyman> by their class names or something...
[09:59:57] <danheberden> PPaul make the $( html ) and console.dir it
[10:00:04] <danheberden> see what you're working with
[10:00:04] <PPaul> i am
[10:00:14] <innopar> Gorkyman: I think you have to validate individual fields in a from.
[10:00:19] <PPaul> i'm working with a good var
[10:00:26] <PPaul> it has my HTML in it
[10:00:39] <danheberden> i'm saying make sure that the fieldset is getting in there
[10:00:42] <danheberden> like - as a dom node
[10:00:47] <PPaul> it is
[10:00:59] <danheberden> but $( html ).find( 'fieldset' ).length == 0?
[10:01:02] <PPaul> it's full too
[10:01:06] <PPaul> yup
[10:01:06] <danheberden> it doesn't sound like it's getting in there :/
[10:01:55] <AZaytsev> danheberden thank you, works like a charm!
[10:03:15] <PPaul> when i do find('input') i get tags back from inside the fieldset
[10:03:27] <PPaul> this is so weird
[10:03:35] <PPaul> i can't do find('form') either
[10:05:08] <PPaul> :(
[10:07:53] <PPaul> i think my code isn't working because i didn't put my HTML on the dom yet
[10:08:28] <PPaul> how would i use jQuery on html that i want to process before i attach it to the dom?
[10:09:01] <danheberden> you're still creating a dom element, PPaul - you're just not attaching it
[10:09:13] <PPaul> hmm
[10:09:20] <danheberden> if you console.log( $( html ).html() )
[10:09:23] <danheberden> how does that look?
[10:09:59] <PPaul> it doesn't look good
[10:10:16] <danheberden> sounds like your source html might not be quite valid?
[10:10:27] <PPaul> hmmm
[10:10:29] <ajpiano> try $(html).filter("fieldset")
[10:10:44] <ajpiano> it could be the top-level element in the structure you've created
[10:10:49] <ajpiano> therefore you'd have to filter for it, not find it
[10:10:52] <PPaul> that worked
[10:10:57] <danheberden> he mentioned having a form :/
[10:11:04] <danheberden> i assumed fieldset would be IN the form
[10:11:12] <danheberden> leh sigh
[10:11:26] <PPaul> it is... somehow my form isn't in the html, though
[10:12:12] <PPaul> i think my html is right... i'm using emacs, and it would tab weird if it was wrong
[10:12:42] <innociv> innopar, i hate your name
[10:13:03] <innopar> innociv: =(
[10:13:17] <innociv> You're my rival
[10:13:23] <innociv> I challenge you to a gentlemanly coding duel.
[10:13:24] <innopar> lol
[10:13:25] <innociv> En gaurde.
[10:14:57] <jwm> sometimes I hate browsers so much
[10:15:13] <jwm> firefox seems to scroll to hashes before dom ready
[10:15:19] <jwm> chrome/ie don't
[10:15:28] <danheberden> jwm correct
[10:15:32] <jwm> sigh
[10:15:49] <danheberden> there was some stuff in the w3fools.com source for that
[10:16:00] <jwm> so now I have to put javascript code into my document
[10:16:12] <jwm> I change id on document load to prevent the scrolling
[10:16:20] <SoulRaven> back again, with another question, how i do to run this script multiple time on the same page
[10:16:21] <SoulRaven> http://pastebin.com/QRgLZfhg
[10:16:23] <jwm> seems to be the most friendly thing to do if someone has javascript disabled
[10:16:55] <SoulRaven> now i call this script like this: http://pastebin.com/GDTXyuTM
[10:17:12] <SoulRaven> how i do to have multiple instances of the same script in the page?
[10:19:24] <necromancer> SoulRaven: you mean object, right?
[10:19:44] <necromancer> what do you want multiple instances of, exactly? timerTest.init()?
[10:20:04] <SoulRaven> timetest.init()
[10:20:26] <SoulRaven> i want to have multiple instance of this object on the same page
[10:20:36] <necromancer> SoulRaven: you'll need to write it as an object then
[10:20:46] <necromancer> which i think you've done
[10:21:39] <SoulRaven> but whay is not working now? is somethning wrong ?
[10:21:51] <necromancer> SoulRaven: so selfTimer is written in a certainw ay
[10:22:38] <SoulRaven> how? is not good how i write now?
[10:23:00] <necromancer> sorry about that haha
[10:23:09] <necromancer> selfTimer is written as a "hash object", var selfTimer = {};
[10:23:29] <necromancer> you could just write this as var selfTimer = function(options) { <selfTimer.init code goes here> };
[10:23:59] <necromancer> SoulRaven: then, you can call multiple instances by doing var timer1 = new selfTimer(), timer2 = new selfTimer(), etc.
[10:24:09] <necromancer> and they will all be separate instances of selfTimer
[10:24:22] <necromancer> this is an okay way of doing it if you don't care about prototypal inheritance or anything
[10:24:49] <SoulRaven> ok, so in stead of call the timer.init i will call var timer1 = new seleftimer(options);
[10:27:23] <necromancer> SoulRaven: here's the best way to write it imo
[10:27:24] <necromancer> https://gist.github.com/d87614be83bdb30a4526
[10:27:43] <necromancer> SoulRaven: you call this with var t1 = new selfTimer(); t1.init({ your: options });
[10:28:20] <necromancer> this is, imo, the best way to write it because it works with old and new JS inheritance syntax: new Object() and Object.create(NewObject)
[10:28:46] <A_D> Hi there
[10:29:00] <necromancer> SoulRaven: http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html has a block of code at the end of the file that i use as a "shim" for older browsers who don't have Object.create() defined already
[10:29:18] <A_D> how do one can check the change of each character of a text input?
[10:29:43] <necromancer> SoulRaven: but you can also omit the this.init() entirely and define selfTimer as var selfTimer = function (options) { .. }
[10:29:50] <necromancer> if you wish to do it that
[10:29:50] <A_D> $('#my_input').change only trigger a event after it lost focus
[10:29:50] <necromancer> way
[10:30:08] <A_D> .live('change' ... does the same
[10:30:21] <SoulRaven> i will try now, step by step, i am new in this :)
[10:33:38] <A_D> bind 'keypress set' solved
[10:33:39] <A_D> ...
[10:33:40] <A_D> t y
[10:36:33] <SoulRaven> necromancer: if i do var timerTest = (function(options){//code} how i parse the options in the object?
[10:36:45] <SoulRaven> timerTest(options) ?? is not working like this
[10:37:32] <SoulRaven> >> var options = 2; var timerTest = (function(options){console.log(options);}
[10:37:52] <necromancer> that should work
[10:38:17] <SoulRaven> i get undefined
[10:38:33] <SoulRaven> >> var options = 2; var timerTest = (function(options){console.log(options);})
[10:38:46] <jeffsmykil> How do i go about appending to a div that wasn't there when the dom loaded?
[10:40:59] <necromancer> oh yeah because it's in a closure
[10:41:00] <necromancer> err
[10:41:02] <necromancer> self-exec func
[10:41:08] <necromancer> SoulRaven: why do you enclose it in parenthesis?
[10:42:04] <SoulRaven> like this: var options = 2; var timerTest = function(options){console.log(options);}
[10:42:10] <SoulRaven> still undefined
[10:44:20] <necromancer> SoulRaven: you haven't passed anything in..
[10:44:23] <necromancer> hold on
[10:45:29] <necromancer> SoulRaven: var num = 2; var timerTest = function(options) { console.log(options); }; var timer = new timerTest(num); returns "2"
[10:46:54] <necromancer> ugh..
[10:47:53] <necromancer> SoulRaven: var n = 1; var Timer = function(o) { console.log(o); return true; }; var t = new Timer(n); t; works in firebug
[10:47:58] <necromancer> returns "1" and the Object {}
[10:48:23] <danheberden> SoulRaven this might help?
[10:48:26] <danheberden> ?eval var Timer = function( wat ){ this.init( wat ); }; Timer.prototype = { init: function( wat ){ this.wat = wat; }, get: function() { return this.wat; } }; var a = new Timer( 2 ); var b = new Timer( 4 ); [ a.get(), b.get() ];
[10:48:27] <bot-t> danheberden: [2, 4]
[10:49:05] <jwm> if I keep refreshing a pag
[10:49:06] <jwm> page
[10:49:15] <jwm> I can make $(window).load() not fire
[10:49:17] <jwm> is that normal?
[10:49:39] <jwm> it'll fire 3 times in a row and then the 4th or whatever time I reload the page it won't fire
[10:49:44] <jwm> (my code in the load won't run)
[10:59:34] <andrew9183> what's the method to call if i want to place focus on an input if it is nonzero?
[10:59:42] <andrew9183> i know focus() is for onfocus, but is there one to set focus ?
[11:01:07] <necromancer> andrew9183: i believe it's .trigger('focus')
[11:01:22] <andrew9183> oh let me give it a shot
[11:02:20] <andrew9183> hmm didn't work
[11:02:24] <andrew9183> le tme try a jsfiddle
[11:05:14] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/cMSgZ/
[11:08:06] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find when a function has been already executed or called?
[11:11:41] <khmer> you can write the function so that it modifies something in its closure
[11:11:58] <khmer> or you can write some generic that curries functions
[11:12:40] <SoulRaven> i want to check if a function has been called before, to not call that function another time
[11:12:52] <necromancer> SoulRaven: you can set a boolean in the scope above it
[11:13:15] <necromancer> var hasTheFuncBeenCalledBefore = false;, then in the function's definition do hasTheFuncBeenCalledBefore = true;
[11:13:29] <SoulRaven> ok, but that function will be called again from another place
[11:13:31] <necromancer> and do a check if (hasTheFuncBeenCalledBefore) { ... }
[11:13:38] <necromancer> SoulRaven: so it is being called twice
[11:14:29] <ravenzz> SoulRaven if it is hooked to an event handler you can unbind that
[11:14:49] <SoulRaven> i binded to tabshow
[11:15:32] <SoulRaven> ravenzz: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1694855672
[11:16:00] <SoulRaven> i don't want to call again the mapTest.initMap
[11:16:05] <SoulRaven> when the tab is show
[11:16:16] <ravenzz> just that one?
[11:16:29] <ravenzz> or the whole tabsshow handler?
[11:16:55] <SoulRaven> initMap and reloadMarkers
[11:17:15] <SoulRaven> i want to execute this function only one time when the tab is show
[11:17:55] <SoulRaven> reloadMakers will be called multiple times, but not from tabshow event
[11:19:30] <khmer> SoulRaven: http://pastebin.com/c8dkzvs6
[11:19:30] <ravenzz> SoulRaven I mean this http://jsfiddle.net/k66Rx/
[11:19:37] <khmer> there's a generic solution for you
[11:20:17] <khmer> you can wrap functions in a PaperTrail, they'll still have an apply method, and they let you know when they've been called
[11:20:35] <khmer> actually i can do you one better, one sec
[11:20:51] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/cMSgZ/2/
[11:20:56] <andrew9183> anyone know why this basic example doesnt work ?

[11:27:26] <Rushing> anyone here have alot of google maps v3 api experience?

[11:27:45] <andrew9183> hi
[11:29:24] <JackBauer24> Rushing: just ask the question
[11:29:44] <andrew9183> anyone know? http://jsfiddle.net/cMSgZ/2/
[11:30:44] <khmer> SoulRaven: here's a cleaner version, one that returns a function
[11:30:45] <khmer> http://pastebin.com/mbBipBLD
[11:31:04] <Rushing> i'm trying to get the pixel position of a latlng. i keep finding pretty much the same answer everywhere (OverlayView ... getProjection()), but that doesn't give me the correct object
[11:31:16] <khmer> SoulRaven: usage: function derp(x) { alert(x) } // wanna know when this was called? derp = new PaperTrail(derp);
[11:31:59] <SoulRaven> this, i will try now
[11:32:03] <SoulRaven> thx
[11:32:09] <jrockjiggz> andrew9183: i don't get your example.. but if you want something to be the basis of a z-index, add position: relative
[11:34:28] <jquerynoob> is it possible to grab the value of the Set-Cookie header in an ajax response?  I'm not having any luck with .getResponseHeader("Set-Cookie")

[11:49:15] <maxokiokob> Heyy
[11:49:41] <khmer> hi! how've you been?
[11:50:17] <jquerynoob> ok, guys... sorry if I'm daft, but I still don't get this.  My document.cookie is unset before and after my ajax request.  There is a 'Set-Cookie' header in the ajax response, but I'm not allowed to read it with getResponseHeader().  Is the Set-Cookie header in the ajax response just ignored and discarded by jquery?
[11:51:57] <khmer> jquerynoob: does it come through in .getAllResponseHeaders() ?
[11:52:08] <pifantastic> jquerynoob: try logging out getAllResponseHeaders()
[11:52:13] <pifantastic> on the xhr object
[11:52:13] <jquerynoob> I did
[11:52:15] <jquerynoob> it's not there
[11:52:24] <jquerynoob> but I logged the actual http response and it is in there
[11:52:24] <khmer> jquerynoob: but you see from your request logger that it's included?
[11:52:48] <jquerynoob> in the response:     Set-Cookie: webpy_session_id=b5dc7eb48307b46a1ea9941e463320c2e8df19f1; Path=/webrere/; httponly\r\n
[11:53:24] <jquerynoob> oh!!! hrm, I'm running my script from a different path, maybe it's ignoring the cookie because of that
[11:53:29] <pifantastic> :D
[11:53:32] <pifantastic> jquerynoob: right
[11:53:37] <jquerynoob> ;-)
[11:53:39] <khmer> jquerynoob: the cookie will be set for the domain it's coming from, yeah
[11:53:41] <jquerynoob> <--- see the name
[11:53:49] <khmer> aww
[11:53:52] <jquerynoob> thanks for putting up with me
[11:54:02] <khmer> you're nice!
[11:54:10] <khmer> guys why do people do async:false
[11:54:14] <khmer> why is it so common
[11:54:38] <jquerynoob> I'll try to return the favor sometime.  Back to work!
[11:57:33] <shrug__> how can i add the jquery-ui.js file to jsfiddle without having the link to the file? The site only provides a .zip of it. That I can see
[11:58:54] <rroelofs> khmer: because people aren't used to event based prog and async:false lets them stay in proceedural mode

[11:59:13] <pifantastic> See that checkbox for jQuery UI?
[11:59:21] <khmer> rroelofs: bah, it's not even hard
[11:59:46] <rroelofs> _We_ know that.
[12:00:31] <rroelofs> now imagine you write in C all day and your boss asks you to make his web page dance...
[12:01:31] <khmer> i have a hard time believing there's a C jockey out there asked to do that
[12:01:32] <khmer> java, maybe
[12:03:25] <shrug__> http://jsfiddle.net/EvVqA/1/
[12:04:21] <pifantastic> shrug__: works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/BdWGx/1/
[12:04:24] <pifantastic> in Chrome
[12:04:36] <pifantastic> 16.0.912.32 beta
[12:05:34] <shrug__> Can you test it in IE or Firefox? Mine only works in FIrefox and not the other 2
[12:05:36] <rroelofs> khmer: You would be amazed...
[12:06:33] <shrug__> Hmm, now it's working for me in Chrome and FF.. Did you change something for it to work? I notice your link is different
[12:06:48] <rroelofs> the number o people who think you can do anything because you can program in one lang astounds me
[12:07:33] <pifantastic> shrug__: I removed the <script>tags in the script pane
[12:07:36] <pifantastic> that's all
[12:07:40] <khmer> rroelofs: but enough about node.js
[12:07:42] <khmer> OH
[12:07:44] <khmer> OH!
[12:07:46] <pifantastic> shrug__: are you getting errors in the chrome console?
[12:07:50] <rroelofs> :-)
[12:07:51] * khmer nails it
[12:09:02] <shrug__> Hmm, well actually, this tells me that one of the other js files that im loading on my page is interfering with jQuery UI for IE and Chrome. Maybe prototype 1.7?
[12:09:51] <pifantastic> shrug__: that doesnt sounds like a problem that would only show up in chrome and IE though
[12:10:02] <pifantastic> shrug__: are you getting errors in the chrome console?
[12:10:13] <shrug__> Lemme check
[12:10:51] <phlp> shrug__: you're not even using jquery ui. you completely remade the tab functionality for some reason
[12:11:03] <pifantastic> shrug__: yeah, I was wondering about that...
[12:11:24] <shrug__> Yeah, it's saying jQuery is not defined. Looks like my jQuery.noConflict(); isn't working right?
[12:11:57] <shrug__> Thats because prototype was messing up jquery UI's tabs to where they wouldnt slide back up or down after it animated the first time
[12:12:05] <shrug__> So i rebuilt the tabs
[12:12:18] <pifantastic> shrug__: why are you using prototype and jquery?
[12:12:20] <khmer> man, it's like
[12:12:31] <khmer> if you can't get rid of prototype, then learn to do it with prototype
[12:12:32] <shrug__> we use prototype for field/error validation
[12:12:34] <khmer> it's not a terrible library
[12:12:57] <khmer> honestly there's nothing ONLY jquery can do
[12:13:08] <khmer> it's a library of really well-done convenience functions and objects
[12:13:21] <khmer> prototype is a DIRECT competitor, and using both seems like
[12:13:29] <khmer> well, there's a few extra dozen kb of script on your page
[12:13:35] <rroelofs> but it makes life easier if you can pick one lib an stick with it
[12:13:40] <jwm> can you pass a local var 'stack' ?
[12:13:47] <jwm> I know it is a stupid javascript question
[12:13:49] <TonkaTruck> use jmvc, yall.
[12:14:01] <Eviltwin> jwm: For what?
[12:14:31] <rroelofs> shrug__: jquery ui has a validate component
[12:15:05] <jwm> Eviltwin: I want to have a function that checks if a variable is undefined or not
[12:15:15] <jwm> but I'd need to pass a local var to do that
[12:15:24] <jwm> and not sure how to do that
[12:15:35] <Eviltwin> function isundef(x) { return x === undefined; } ?
[12:15:43] <jwm> you have to use typeof
[12:15:56] <Eviltwin> You mean to check if the variable even exists?
[12:16:26] <jwm> right now I do exists(obj) { return typeof window[obj] !== 'undefined' }
[12:16:28] <jwm> yeah
[12:16:46] <jwm> then I do exists('blah')
[12:16:50] <jwm> of course blah has to be global
[12:17:10] <jwm> other thing I can do is exists(scope,obj) { ... scope[obj] }
[12:17:18] <TonkaTruck> http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57322873-92/steve-jobs-prevails-over-adobes-flash/ RIP flash.  And by "Rest in peace" I mean HAHAHAHAHAHA
[12:17:53] <Eviltwin> While if(stack) { ... } will fail if stack has not been declared via "var stack" or window.stack
[12:18:11] <Eviltwin> if(typeof stack !== "undefined") and if(window.stack !== undefined) will not fail
[12:18:24] <jwm> yeah I just wanted a nifty function to handle it
[12:18:29] <Eviltwin> Why?
[12:18:30] <jwm> I could always do an if(....)
[12:18:35] <jwm> just for the hell ofi t
[12:18:49] <jwm> I like functions
[12:19:14] <shrug__> @rroelofs Do you have a link to the jquery ui validation documentation?
[12:20:28] <jwm> I found something on stackoverflow
[12:20:30] <jwm> cool article on it

[12:46:53] <GoSox> I'm returning false from inside a .submit() on a form, but IE7 and IE8 are still submitting the form anyway. Any idea why?
[12:47:37] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/TctXYZtq
[12:48:04] <GoSox> line #32 is the return that seem to get ignored. The alert from line #29 is showed. Then after that, the form is submitted sans jquery
[12:49:06] <labratt> can someone help me convert this to a plugin please http://jsfiddle.net/labratt/Jd4CH/8/
[12:49:38] <jrockjiggz> GoSox, i normally do:   $('form').submit( function(){ if(!validate){ return false; } });
[12:49:57] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Make a jsFiddle
[12:50:45] <GoSox> jrockjiggz: that is essentially what i have. the only difference is that you have a function that returns false, if another function returns false. My code just skips the middleman
[12:51:45] <AzizLight> how can I retrieve the cursor position in a textfield please? More importantly how can I check if there is a character before/after the cursor in a text field please?
[12:52:32] <jrockjiggz> GoSox, i also put the validation function INSIDE the submit function, to contain namespace

[13:06:16] <plainas> Hey all, I want to write a pictures slideshow plugin (I know, there are many already, but none does what I want). tipically I would I do this? are all the images pre-loaded into de dom? That sounds like it could be heavy
[13:07:18] <labratt> hey plains i am trying to do the same.. i am trying to convert this to a plugin now http://jsfiddle.net/labratt/Jd4CH/8/
[13:07:32] <labratt> member:plainas
[13:08:44] <plainas> just a link to next and prev, labratt?
[13:09:02] <labratt> for now… thats all i need for what i am doing
[13:09:21] <labratt> i just need to do that slider 6 times on the same page
[13:09:44] <plainas> labratt, you have the images loaded into your dom. I'm wondering if that is a common practice or if there's any lighter way to do it that doesn't load all the images at once
[13:10:11] <labratt> thats the next think i need to figure out
[13:10:48] <labratt> i may already have a way
[13:10:59] <labratt> one sec i will show you in a fiddle
[13:11:07] <shrug__> Is there a way for jquery/js to detect a change in the url?
[13:12:30] <GoSox> when calling a function as a callback function, should I be putting the empty parenthesis after "VerifyURL" ?
[13:12:34] <GoSox> $("#tinyurlform").submit( VerifyURL );
[13:12:48] <GoSox> instead of ^, this:  $("#tinyurlform").submit( VerifyURL() );
[13:13:04] <VeXii> no
[13:13:44] <VeXii> if  VerifyURL is ready for a event and data parameters just leave out the ()
[13:14:05] <jrockjiggz> GoSox: you should define VarifyURL as a function.. iei   var VerifyURL = function(){ //code }   then submit(verifyURL)
[13:14:18] <GoSox> yes that is what i did
[13:14:29] <GoSox> wait
[13:14:36] <GoSox> thats not what i did
[13:14:38] <jrockjiggz> i didnt see
[13:14:48] <GoSox> store a function in a variable?
[13:14:53] <jrockjiggz> yes
[13:15:15] <jrockjiggz> then try typeof(vertifyURL) should return function
[13:15:32] <GoSox> but why would i do this?
[13:15:57] <GoSox> also this is what i'm starting with: http://pastebin.com/TctXYZtq
[13:16:12] <GoSox> i defined my functions as functions

[13:27:31] <khmer> help
[13:31:25] <GoSox> can a js function be declared anywhere in a document or does it have to be at a certain place (ie before it is called, so at the top of a documnet)
[13:32:20] <thinkclay> more specifically: I need a calculation to pass a latLng, distance, and direction and get a second set of coords back (context is google maps)
[13:32:28] <ldlework> How do you cause jquery to make an actual post request, including actually visiting the target?
[13:32:35] <ldlework> As opposed to just a ajax post
[13:38:47] <muzone> is there a prettier way to write this?
[13:39:43] <muzone> Is there a prettier way to write this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/nH3zm/ - $.post($(this).attr("action"), $(this).serialize(), null, "script");
[13:39:49] <khmer> ldlework: build a form and submit it
[13:43:28] <GoSox> in a nutshell, what is the difference between using $("#form").submit() and $("#form").ajaxForm(); ?
[13:46:05] <Jon47> is ajaxForm a method in the jquery API?  I don't recognize it
[13:46:29] <GoSox> i guess it's an add-on
[13:46:55] <GoSox> i'm also seeing ajaxSubmit() in my code, i'm getting thoroughly confused after writing a ton of code that works
[13:48:21] <mats_> if use addClass on hover, can I somehow skip the first element?
[13:48:43] <ajpiano> GoSox: submit just does the normal submit event of a form
[13:48:47] <ajpiano> posting to another page
[13:49:01] <ajpiano> ajaxForm is a plugin that wires up a plugin so that when it is submitted
[13:49:14] <ajpiano> it submits via ajax - using the form's attributes (method, action, etc)
[13:49:34] <ajpiano> ajaxSubmit is a method that plugin makes available, and which does most of the heavy lifting
[13:50:02] <ajpiano> ajaxForm essentially just does $("form").submit( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).ajaxSubmit() });
[13:50:04] <ajpiano> so
[13:50:10] <ajpiano> i hope that makes the difference clear
[13:50:14] <mats_> maybe it should be asked: can i somehow make sure that the first element isn't affected by the addClass action?
[13:50:15] <ajpiano> cause i legit have to shower
[13:50:46] <ajpiano> mats_: $(".foo").not(":first").addClass("bar")
[13:51:29] <mats_> ajpiano: thanks :) seems like i should read up on the .not action
[13:51:55] <ajpiano> .not is just .filter but opposite
[13:52:23] <web_program123> how do I do regex in jquery/js
[13:52:55] <Pilate> ask the google
[13:53:19] <GoSox> don't disturb the google!
[13:53:57] <web_program123> ?
[13:54:03] <mats_> i'll have to read on most of them, i'm all new to this. but someone mentioned .not for another question i had as well. so it seems good to know what it can do
[13:54:14] <Pilate> web_program123: attempt to find the answer yourself before looking for a free tutor
[13:54:37] <web_program123> I have been, I know regex, just not the function

[13:56:48] <yi> hi guys.. I'm in the process of making my own jquery ui widget and I was wondering how you can make "this" refer to the widget inside the callback function?
[13:57:09] <yi> $.proxy doesn't seem to work at all
[13:57:21] <mats_> i love jquery, you can do nice things so easy :)
[13:57:22] <web_program123> thanks
[13:58:27] <mats_> but you know you're new to it when you create the same function four times to achieve the wanted effect hehe
[13:58:39] <GoSox> does return value; always halt execution of a function?
[13:58:40] <AzizLight> when I use the after function the sibling that I create appears directly, how can I make it fade in please?
[13:59:09] <GoSox> So I can just make a long list of if (blurp) { return false; }
[13:59:30] <elitejbjlf> my irc client seems to be screwy, might one of you send me a pm?

Not really knowing what was wrong with the old code exactly. but now its much shorter and cleaner and more readable and it works properly, whoda-thought

[14:44:27] <scar3> http://fox.apt25.net/ -- why isnt the BOOK NOW button at the top goin gto jquery??
[14:50:57] <subbzeroe> i wonder what kind of questions come up here
[14:52:53] <scar3> http://fox.apt25.net/ -- why isnt the BOOK NOW button at the top goin gto jquery??
[14:52:58] <scar3> going to*
[14:59:54] <khmer> scar3: what's it supposed to do
[15:00:13] <pioto> hi, not sure if i hit a regression between 1.6.4 and 1.7, or if i'm Doing It Wrong. but... i have 2 click events, one triggered on a click in a table, and the other on a click on 'body'. previously, if the table event fired, body didn't. but it seems that it is now, causing my context menu to open and close instantly...
[15:00:23] <pioto> any suggestions?
[15:04:19] <khmer> pioto: can you reproduce the problem in a jsFiddle?
[15:04:37] <mod> Hmm nothing in the topic... is thre a problem with the jquery.com documentation pages?   They're all mostly blank.
[15:04:41] <phlp> ? event.stopPropagation @ pioto
[15:04:42] <bot-t> pioto, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[15:06:15] <cook1es> Hey guys I have a userscript which has jQuery and works fine with Chrome with no javascript errors, however with Firefox I do get errors when visiting the same page. The page has jQuery and the error relates to jQuery so I am guessing that my script somehow removes the onsite jQuery implementation, any ideas?
[15:08:02] <pioto> sample: http://jsfiddle.net/LVv3t/
[15:08:32] <pioto> hrm. can't reproduce it the way i had it working on 1.6.4.
[15:08:55] <pioto> phlp: but, well. would that have changed in 1.7?
[15:09:00] <scar3> kharloss: m
[15:09:05] <pioto> because my code didn't change, i just updated to 1.7 and my code stopped working...
[15:09:22] <pioto> unfortunately, my attempt at a simple case in jsfiddle didn't work as intended apparently
[15:10:21] <pioto> but, yeah. i'll just stopPropagation. thank.s
[15:12:57] <ProLoser|Work> anyone heard of angularjs?
[15:15:52] <pioto> /part/part
[15:22:50] <jaequery> ProLoser|Work, yes, using it, why?
[15:25:08] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: how has it worked out for you in comparison to something like backbone or sproutcore?
[15:25:50] <jaequery> its okay but also a bit hellish
[15:26:14] <jaequery> there are stuff that's just easier doing via dom / jquery
[15:26:32] <jaequery> trying to do via bindings definitely has it's cons
[15:26:57] <jaequery> but angular is a lot better than bb tho imo
[15:27:04] <ProLoser|Work> ya… now that i look, i realize it uses inline bindings
[15:27:07] <ProLoser|Work> that seems…. foolish
[15:27:13] <ProLoser|Work> how so?
[15:27:33] <jaequery> concept is cleaner
[15:27:48] <ProLoser|Work> :/
[15:28:01] <jaequery> and plus you can just unit test everything in angular
[15:28:16] <jaequery> not sure if you can do that now w/ backbone, but last time i used it wasn't
[15:28:20] <ProLoser|Work> you can't do that in backbone/spine?
[15:28:26] <goleif> Hi! How do I decide what will happen directly when an element is created, now when live() is gonna disappear?
[15:28:27] <jaequery> which was like about 8 months ago
[15:28:52] <jaequery> not sure, imaybe it is ... i think i did hear it's possible somewhere
[15:29:07] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: i'm looking at the example on the home page, the todo app (of course), but i don't see anything explicitly calling redraw
[15:29:15] <ProLoser|Work> is that implicitly fired after each event
[15:29:34] <ProLoser|Work> goleif: rephrase your question better
[15:30:29] <goleif> ProLoser: Sorry. For example: As soon as #hello is created, I want to apply a border to it.
[15:30:36] <goleif> ProLoser: How can I do that?
[15:31:33] <ProLoser|Work> since element creation isn't a dom event (at least, i don't think it is, not sure if onLoad is available to the whole dom) you need to fire off the css change explicitly when you create the element
[15:31:39] <ProLoser|Work> or solution b: use css genius
[15:32:04] <ccmonster> how do i set a <intput type='text'/> text value as I build it
[15:32:09] <ccmonster> before its on the dom
[15:32:30] <ccmonster> var t = 'sometext'; $('<input/>',{name:"entity", 'class':"topic new_topic_input",type:"text",value:t,});  ?
[15:32:34] <ccmonster> that doesn't work
[15:33:34] <ProLoser|Work> how are you building it
[15:34:01] <ccmonster> i showed you
[15:34:30] <jaequery> ProLoser|Work, yeah it is 2 way binded, dom / js
[15:35:06] <ccmonster> ProLoser|Work, http://pastie.org/2849869
[15:35:18] <ProLoser|Work> well i don't really see a 'model' so i didn't understand how the 2 way binding was occurring
[15:35:22] <ProLoser|Work> or is it implicit
[15:35:48] <ProLoser|Work> anything that isn't a function but has an nr:repeat is the form of 2 way binding i take it?
[15:36:37] <ccmonster> who you talking to ?
[15:36:59] <ProLoser|Work> ccmonster: multitasking
[15:37:04] <jaequery> they use expressions,  which can refer to string / method / jsexpr
[15:37:16] <ProLoser|Work> first, don't "guess" how functions work (like $('<li>', {})
[15:37:19] <ProLoser|Work> go read the api
[15:37:22] <ProLoser|Work> @ccmonster
[15:37:28] <jaequery> {{hello}}  ==    this.hello = 'hi there';
[15:37:29] <ProLoser|Work> second, WHY are you building dom in this way?
[15:37:48] <ccmonster> These are some dynamic elements
[15:37:58] <ccmonster> I build out the number needed based on the query string
[15:38:00] <jaequery> {{hello('there')}}   ==    var hello = function(msg){ ..}
[15:38:16] <ProLoser|Work> could be way more elegant
[15:38:22] <ccmonster> such as ?
[15:38:26] <ProLoser|Work> does $('el', {attributes}) actually work?
[15:38:29] <ProLoser|Work> i've never seen that before
[15:38:40] <ccmonster> which line?
[15:38:45] <jaequery> and all your forms are binded directly to the name of the element, to the controller's properties
[15:38:45] <ProLoser|Work> uh…. all of em?
[15:38:55] <ccmonster> yes, el works
[15:39:02] <ProLoser|Work> no
[15:39:07] <ProLoser|Work> $(el, attributes)
[15:39:13] <ccmonster> yes that works
[15:39:14] <ProLoser|Work> i thought the second argument is for scope
[15:39:14] <jaequery> i been using angular for about 3 months now but to be honest, it slows me down quite a bit even then
[15:39:38] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: how so? seems like the direct binding into the dom of code is like going backwards rather than forwards
[15:39:46] <ccmonster> you can build any jq obj by passing a json object or approp properties
[15:39:51] <jaequery> its cool though, there are definitely some good perks, like you said about scope,     i love how you can just do,  ng:controller="SomeCtrl"  into any element
[15:39:57] <ProLoser|Work> ccmonster: use templates
[15:40:03] <ProLoser|Work> building html in that manner is very bad juju
[15:40:16] <ccmonster> I have not used Templates, although i've heard its nice
[15:40:17] <jaequery> thats what i thought too
[15:40:33] <jaequery> but its a little different but you get used to it and it makes sense
[15:40:43] <ccmonster> but outside of templates, this is quite efficient, and easy to use
[15:40:45] <eddiemonge> ?selectors
[15:40:46] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[15:40:55] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: i mean half of the thing of css NOT being inline is ease of refactor, i could imagine huge pains in the ass any time the dom needs to change just to cater to some new css or layout or something, breaking almost everything
[15:41:10] <ProLoser|Work> ccmonster: so use templates
[15:41:27] <ccmonster> well, back to the original question, which templates doesn't solve
[15:41:38] <ProLoser|Work> and that was?
[15:42:26] <ccmonster> getting the val('mytext') set when i build the element
[15:42:28] <jaequery> well its not much different from templating engines
[15:42:37] <ccmonster> eddiemonge, any chance you have some insight
[15:43:05] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: i suppose...
[15:43:08] <eddiemonge> to what?
[15:43:11] <ProLoser|Work> i worry about situations that have complex binds
[15:43:23] <ProLoser|Work> but i suppose that's kind of… irrelevant
[15:43:42] <jaequery> yea i worry all the time, it kind of makes you think twice in a lot of things
[15:43:51] <ProLoser|Work> eddiemonge: he's trying to build an unruly chunk of html programmatically, i told him to use templates
[15:43:53] <jaequery> but you get used to it
[15:44:00] <ProLoser|Work> ccmonster: templates DO solve your other problem btw
[15:44:16] <ProLoser|Work> mainly because you could just pass whatever text you want as a variable to the template, just like everything else
[15:44:24] <ProLoser|Work> in fact...
[15:44:38] <MTPrower> Good evening, awesome fun peeps. I seem to be calling more than one instance of jQuery on my WordPress blog. May I have some support on how to fix it? I have more information in a support question here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-conflict-in-wordpress?replies=1#post-2442729
[15:44:59] <ccmonster> this ia just a prototype pieces, and dont really want to start up with templates at the moment. just trying to figure this one piece and moving on to bigger 'fish'.
[15:45:03] <ccmonster> i can mess with templates later.
[15:45:22] <eddiemonge> better to do it now
[15:45:26] <eddiemonge> templates are your friend
[15:45:29] <ProLoser|Work> ccmonster: https://gist.github.com/1359692
[15:45:36] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[15:45:51] <Vooloo> can jquery sort the way wordpress can sort your dashboard? drag and drop into set locations
[15:45:52] <eddiemonge> less error prone, faster coding, much more betters :D
[15:46:11] <eddiemonge> Vooloo: sure. jQuery can do anything
[15:46:12] <ProLoser|Work> Vooloo: yes, google jquery ui
[15:46:23] <ccmonster> yes.
[15:46:48] <Vooloo> I am on the UI page but cant find any stickyness drag and drop, just one that goes everywhere
[15:46:53] <ccmonster> lol guys,  just trying to get the answer to this one piece.
[15:47:53] <eddiemonge> Vooloo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to
[15:47:59] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: to what?
[15:48:35] <jaequery> eddiemonge: is it possible to replace jQuery and $ ,  to be renamed to like,  $sQuery ?
[15:48:37] <ccmonster> var t = 'sometext'; $('<input/>',{name:"entity", 'class':"topic new_topic_input",type:"text",value:t,});  ?
[15:48:48] <ccmonster> setting the value/text of that input when I am building it
[15:48:54] <jaequery> because i hate dealing with conflicts with other potential jquery scripts, the site owners might have
[15:49:52] <Vooloo> eddiemonge: thanks
[15:49:52] <jaequery> and i find noconflict a bit unreliable, especially when there could be other prototype/mootools and jquery
[15:50:02] <MTPrower> I'll just wait a bit until you guys aren't so actively getting support before I re-ask or remind about my jQuery conflict question...
[15:50:15] <eddiemonge> jaequery: $sQuery = jQuery.noConflict();
[15:50:54] <jaequery> what if there was another version of jquery already loaded that already used noConflict ? to not conflict w/ mootools?
[15:51:04] <eddiemonge> jaequery: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page
[15:51:38] <eddiemonge> jaequery: doesnt matter. after calling to the jquerys you want, call your own noconflict
[15:52:07] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: thats fine for quick and dirty
[15:52:36] <jaequery> hm i think i ran into some problem before ... i'll have another crack at it
[15:52:39] <jaequery> thx ;)
[15:53:00] <erichynds> jaequery: you can pass noConflict() the true boolean to release it from the "jQuery" var as well.
[15:53:55] <ccmonster> it doesnt seem to work eddiemonge . no value appears in the input when i append to dom
[15:54:02] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ ccmonster
[15:54:03] <bot-t> ccmonster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[15:54:06] <eddiemonge> youknow the drill
[15:55:37] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: ill save you the trouble http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZsHvu/
[16:03:23] <eddiemonge> ccmonster: even more robin sparkles for you: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZsHvu/1/
[16:03:41] <jrockjiggz> shot in the dark here... for an password field,  .attr('type','text') doesn't change...   i can't use prop because i'm with jq1.5   any ideas?
[16:04:28] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: changing the type is murky. its better to have another box that gives focus to the password
[16:05:17] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: oh jk
[16:05:53] <jrockjiggz> eddie: tx
[16:06:00] <Ring0`> Hey. I tried to use $("input[name^='foo']" || "select[name^='goo']").change(). However it reacts only on input change, not on select.
[16:06:26] <jrockjiggz> || isn't an operator
[16:06:41] <Ring0`> What is the or operator then?
[16:06:47] <Jon47> use a css selector there
[16:06:48] <Jon47> comma
[16:06:52] <Jon47> all in one string
[16:06:55] <Ring0`> oh
[16:06:59] <jrockjiggz> $("input[name^='foo'] select[name^='goo']")
[16:07:07] <Jon47> needs a comma between them
[16:07:16] <jrockjiggz> comma yes, i forgo
[16:07:17] <Ring0`> worked perfectly Jon47 thanks!
[16:07:52] <eddiemonge> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ZsHvu/2/
[16:08:15] <eddiemonge> Ring0`: ,
[16:08:29] <eddiemonge> $("input[name^='foo'], select[name^='goo']").change()
[16:08:50] <eddiemonge> ?change
[16:08:51] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[16:09:02] <jrockjiggz> eddiemonge: wow thats very helpful ty
[16:09:24] <eddiemonge> Ring0`:  "For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus."
[16:09:53] <Ring0`> Thanks!!
[16:12:39] <RockMeAmadeus> i have some scripts i'm loading right before </body> but I don't want all their variables in a global scope. It seems dumb to use $('document').load(), should I use an anonymous function instead?
[16:13:07] <ProLoser|Work> jaequery: i have one last question, what are the problems you've been having that make using angular like… MORE time consuming rather than more productive?
[16:13:25] <ProLoser|Work> i'm curious about where specifically i might expect to run into problems
[16:13:58] <eddiemonge> RockMeAmadeus: jQuery(function($){ ... });
[16:14:44] <buht> help please? http://jsfiddle.net/wT7CU/ -- why does my native 640x480 video get partially shown on the canvas here?
[16:15:40] <jrockjiggz> how can i get this from $(this)
[16:15:52] <ProLoser|Work> jrockjiggz: rephrase
[16:16:23] <jrockjiggz> ugh
[16:16:25] <jrockjiggz> uh
[16:16:33] <jrockjiggz> sorry
[16:16:38] <ProLoser|Work> seems backwards though
[16:16:44] <ProLoser|Work> just don't put it into $()
[16:16:52] <buht> this.
[16:16:57] <ProLoser|Work> what he said
[16:16:57] <eddiemonge> buht: why are you drawing a video?
[16:17:09] <buht> eddiemonge: i need to manipulate it and draw lines on it
[16:17:26] <buht> eddiemonge: well on the canvas over it.
[16:17:36] <eddiemonge> and? have you looked at popcorn.js not sure if its what you need but might be good
[16:17:47] <buht> eddiemonge: not yet.
[16:18:01] <buht> eddiemonge: any idea why my video wont show in normal size on a canvas of same size?
[16:18:25] <jaequery> ProLoser|Work, like, ng:options , is kind of buggy
[16:18:41] <jaequery> other than that its fine
[16:18:56] <jaequery> and there are some weird things happening every now and then
[16:18:57] <eddiemonge> buht: looks like they are two block level elements and the canvas is getting pushed below it
[16:19:26] <buht> eddiemonge: hmmm... so put the video attribute second?
[16:19:42] <eddiemonge> buht: why not just absolutely position the canvas over the video?
[16:19:55] <buht> eddiemonge: how? im new to this stuff
[16:20:16] <buht> eddiemonge: notice the video is hidden though
[16:20:47] <eddiemonge> like any other absolutely positioned element. or you could use relative positioning if thats your cup of tea
[16:20:49] <buht> eddiemonge: just reversed their block order. no different. video remains hidden per css
[16:21:46] <buht> eddiemonge: ill have to read up on absolute positioning, ive not used it yet.. and how to absolute position one item over another... but my video is hidden anyway, and i reversed their block order and no change, so is that the problem?
[16:21:51] <eddiemonge> buht: i didnt say reverse their order, i said position them. you know, with like css and stuff
[16:22:09] <eddiemonge> buht: your video is hidden because its non-existenet
[16:22:16] <eddiemonge> existent even
[16:22:18] <buht> eddiemonge: do i need to position a hidden video?
[16:22:26] <buht> eddiemonge: its very existent, i see it if i dont hide it
[16:23:00] <datagroove> question, i have a series of radio inputs with labels, i am hiding the radios, and trying to get query to change the background color of the label when the its clicked. how can i do this?
[16:23:07] <eddiemonge> oh yeah, missed the display none
[16:23:08] <buht> eddiemonge: the canvas wouldnt paint it if it didnt exist using drawimage
[16:23:11] <eddiemonge> buht: well show it
[16:23:21] <buht> eddiemonge: ? show it?
[16:23:46] <eddiemonge> datagroove: so you in essence want the labels to be the buttons?
[16:23:52] <eddiemonge> buht: yeah. display: block
[16:24:03] <buht> eddiemonge: didnt u ask me already why im using canvas?
[16:24:16] <buht> eddiemonge: because i dont want to use video, i need to use the canvas for more advanced stuff
[16:24:33] <eddiemonge> you can still use canvas over the video and draw in the canvas
[16:24:43] <datagroove> eddiemonge: yes, the labels are displayed block, radios hidden, when a user clicks on the label i was trying to addClass, to display a different background color of the label.
[16:24:49] <buht> okay, i guess thats a different way to go about it.
[16:25:25] <eddiemonge> datagroove: $('label').click(function() { $(this).addClass('something'); })
[16:25:31] <buht> eddiemonge: so .... first display the video... then make a canvas directly over it somehow?
[16:25:32] <datagroove> eddiemonge: of course after i figure this out i then have to figure out how to remove the class or toggle if the user chagnes his selection
[16:25:40] <eddiemonge> with, you know, a check of the radio state to determine which class to toggle
[16:25:51] <eddiemonge> ?toggleClass @ datagroove
[16:25:52] <bot-t> datagroove, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[16:26:03] <eddiemonge> buht: yes. with css positioning
[16:26:47] <MeXTuX> I have 41 class="menuLink" divs and I need the first one to move to the end. Example: <div class="menuLink" name="lastDiv">lorem ipsum</div><div class="menuLink" name="firstDiv">lorem ipsum</div> Is this possible?? Tnx in advance
[16:27:14] <buht> eddiemonge: i need to make it so the user can click it and move their mouse and it will draw on the canvas... will i be able to do that in your method?
[16:27:20] <datagroove> eddiemonge: right now i have $(#radio-id).change(function()
[16:27:27] <datagroove> so how do i get the label from there
[16:27:43] <buht> eddiemonge: also, still be able to play/stop/etc with a canvas ontop of it? sorry im new to this.
[16:28:06] <eddiemonge> MeXTuX: $('.menuLink').first().insertAfter('.menuLink') maybe
[16:28:20] <eddiemonge> MeXTuX: $('.menuLink').first().insertAfter( $('.menuLink').last() ) maybe
[16:28:45] <eddiemonge> buht: yes since the canvas will be on *top* of the video
[16:29:07] <eddiemonge> of course you will have to have some way to control the video so covering up its controls might be bad
[16:29:20] <buht> eddiemonge: ok.. ill rework my code and try all that out
[16:29:32] <buht> eddiemonge: thanks,... hope it works out hehe
[16:29:34] <eddiemonge> datagroove: depends on where your label is in relation to that. code helps see ? pe
[16:29:35] <bot-t> datagroove, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[16:29:56] <Ox41> I feel like there has to be a better way to do this function.... I feel like my logic is out of whack, http://jsfiddle.net/DkC85/
[16:32:43] <eddiemonge> Ox41: a for loop would be better than a .each loop
[16:32:59] <Ox41> yeah... I was trying to be j-Query-esque
[16:33:00] <eddiemonge> i dont think you know what this is see ? isarray
[16:33:01] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[16:33:45] <eddiemonge> Ox41: dont do that. be jQuery-esques when you need to be, not for the fun of it. using jquery is a performance hit

[16:39:22] <eddiemonge> box-shadow doesnt have a width
[16:39:46] <lemon24> Hi! I have a little problem with .animate(), when I try to animate the width of an element, the parent's height changes briefly. Any idea what the cause might be?
[16:39:57] <eddiemonge> it has an x coordinate, y coordinate and a blur width
[16:40:03] <eddiemonge> do you mean you want blur width?
[16:40:23] <eddiemonge> lemon24: is the element an inline level element?
[16:40:59] <buht> eddiemonge: yeah im trying to just add up all the width-like stuff in the container so i can appropriately deal with placing a video and canvas
[16:41:15] <lemon24> eddiemonge: yes, a span with display: inline-block

[17:19:00] <chovy> any good papers/articles out there on organizing jquery code?
[17:19:22] <chovy> I usually just do $(function(){ //all my stuff here }); but it's growing out of control.
[17:20:35] <datagroove> Hi All, i am coming up short on how to do three things to these radio buttons. http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/4/ If you got skills and 2 min i would really appreciate a look and some direction. Thank you.
[17:22:08] <datagroove> ops with ?''s http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/5/
[17:33:28] <thinkclay> how do you check if a plugin is set / defined in jq? I tried typeof $.foo() != 'undefined' to no avail
[17:35:53] <chovy> datagroove: what's the issue?
[17:36:24] <datagroove> chovy: if you look at the out put of http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/6/ you can see the radios are outside the box
[17:36:27] <datagroove> the is the primary
[17:36:53] <chovy> what do you mean "outside the box"
[17:38:16] <datagroove> chovy: the radio buttons label was turned into a box ( display block) so the radio is outside of the visual box
[17:38:51] <chovy> datagroove: you're floating them. just make them inline or use clearfix on the parent container.
[17:39:02] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/7/
[17:39:37] <datagroove> hmm...
[17:40:14] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/7/
[17:40:20] <chovy> woops
[17:40:21] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/kTSL3/8/
[17:41:07] <datagroove> chovy: the radio button is still outside the grey box
[17:44:20] <chovy> it isn't
[17:44:30] <chovy> the radio button is to the right of the box, above the next box.
[17:47:09] <datagroove> chovy: I'm going to up a snap so you can see the desired look...
[17:48:00] <datagroove> chovy: http://imgur.com/IUu2C
[17:54:34] <chovy> why not just wrap them?
[17:55:04] <chovy> <label><input /><div class="amount">$1</div></label>
[17:55:17] <chovy> then float all your labels left, and use clearfix on the parent.
[17:56:08] <datagroove> chovy: that would be ideal, but i don't' have access to the server script
[17:56:25] <datagroove> so its all jQuery
[17:57:56] <datagroove> chovy: its tuff, thanks for trying. I may have to go another route
[17:59:52] <chovy> datagroove: http://jsfiddle.net/4euQA/4/
[18:00:40] <chovy> if you don't control your html, how are you expected to do anything?
[18:02:09] <Mnkras-Laptop> how can I watch a var and when it changes execute a method?
[18:02:11] <datagroove> chovy: thanks, something like that is the desired end result, i was hoping in jQuery i could do something without hacking the CRMs code, but it looks like i will have to go down that route.
[18:02:23] <chovy> of course.
[18:02:27] <datagroove> :)
[18:02:35] <chovy> if the code sucks...
[18:02:46] <chovy> kind of hard to make ugly code work the way you want.
[18:04:10] <datagroove> agreed
[18:08:14] <Mnkras-Laptop> how can I watch a var and when it changes execute a method?
[18:09:00] <karega|aniasis> hello
[18:11:01] <karega|aniasis> I have several elements, each the same width and height at the same top and left, essentially 'stacked' upon one another.  I am trying to allow a mousemove event to bubble up from the 'top' element to all elements.
[18:11:05] <karega|aniasis> how is this possible?
[18:12:01] <Aric> BTW :: I resolved my issue, apparently the jQuery Tristate plugin only works with jQuery 1.5 and below... I was using 1.6 and 1.7 to test it :(
[18:12:18] <Aric> really shouldn't be the only multi checkbox solution if it's that ancient though
[18:12:22] <Aric> it was made for 1.3.2
[18:13:42] <karega|aniasis> yo
[18:18:05] <ericduran> hmm, weird question, what does jquery use to generate it's api docs
[18:20:52] <snover> human beings.
[18:22:03] <Aric> people.
[18:22:59] <ericduran> really? is not generated
[18:23:14] <ericduran> cool, Thanks.
[18:34:29] <MTPrower> Hello. Is anyone open to offer jQuery support?
[18:34:50] <jrockjiggz> this _IS_ the jquery channel
[18:35:11] <MTPrower> maybe, but it's been too busy for me to get a question in today
[18:35:27] <jrockjiggz> ask away
[18:36:30] <MTPrower> I have WordPress and I put a jQuery mp3 player in my blog at http://www.vgreboot.com. There seems to be more than one instance of jQuery loaded if I add the line in that makes the player use Google's jQuery, but the mp3 player will work. Just all the jQuery stuff AFTER it messes up
[18:36:56] <MTPrower> here is a more full support question, plus the code is in the pastebin: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-conflict-in-wordpress?replies=1#post-2442729
[18:37:26] <MTPrower> it seems to be a really simple jQuery contradiction, but I don't do jQuery... I had to follow the mp3 player's instructions to install
[18:37:32] <jrockjiggz> have you tried noConflict() ?
[18:37:49] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: wordpress uses it automatically, right? Where should the noConflict be?
[18:38:17] <Aric> jQuery Team, please update the jQuery Plugin page for Tristate plugin to use the new version by a new author (seems to be an update though both are 1.1) ---> http://jlbruno.github.com/jQuery-Tristate-Checkbox-plugin/
[18:38:18] <jrockjiggz> well if you load jquery, then you can define a var like $$$ = jQuery.noConflict()
[18:38:40] <jrockjiggz> then you can load another jquery, and can refer to the old one with $$$
[18:38:43] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: some of the jQuery on my site uses noConflict. I don't think the mp3 player does. But all the mp3 player's code stuff is in the header.php, which is linked to here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-conflict-in-wordpress?replies=1#post-2442729
[18:38:45] <Aric> 1.0*
[18:38:51] <jrockjiggz> *new one rather
[18:39:43] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: http://pastebin.com/2nCYpGDv
[18:40:03] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: there's a line removed from #53, I think
[18:40:20] <MTPrower> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
[18:40:40] <MTPrower> that line. If I add it, the mp3 player will work, but all the jQuery below it won't
[18:41:09] <jrockjiggz> add the noconflict like i said, and replace $( function(){      with    $$$( function($){
[18:41:30] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: so how do I add noConflict to the mp3 player in the header.php that I linked to?
[18:45:14] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: are you there?
[18:45:50] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: if you need, I can give you more information. I know a lot about the problem. I just don't know anything about jQuery
[18:46:48] <jrockjiggz> MTPrower: http://pastebin.com/index/2nCYpGDv
[18:47:18] <jrockjiggz> oops
[18:48:01] <MTPrower> ...
[18:48:16] <jrockjiggz> http://pastebin.com/6x7Kv4ui
[18:48:26] <MTPrower> Thanks.
[18:48:59] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: nobody even suggesting anything like what you just did. Have you worked with WordPress before?
[18:49:05] <MTPrower> *even suggested
[18:49:19] <jrockjiggz> no i dont know it
[18:49:30] <jrockjiggz> i might be wrong
[18:49:53] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: Alright. Well, I think they want <?php at the top, but I dunno. I'll tell you if this breaks my site.
[18:50:07] <jrockjiggz> well u can put it anywhere but before your mp3 player
[18:50:40] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: so I can put it before "<link type="text/css" href="/skin/jplayer.blue.monday.css" rel="stylesheet" />" ?
[18:50:53] <jrockjiggz> yea
[18:51:06] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: Alright. Will try. I'll tell you what happens.
[18:52:14] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: can I put it right below that line I just mentioned? That's where the old "<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js">" used to be
[18:52:30] <jrockjiggz> ok
[18:55:15] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: It made the mp3 player work, but it broke the jQuery stuff below it, like it did when the google jQuery line thingy used to be there. Take a look: http://www.vgreboot.com. That green text below the white block mp3 player is a marquee. Plus there's other broken things
[18:55:40] <jrockjiggz> what v of jquery is needed for the other
[18:55:45] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: however, the jQuery slideshow seems to work
[18:55:59] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: I'm not sure. How would I find out?
[18:56:18] <jrockjiggz> wp default i assume
[18:56:32] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: the jQuery slideshow is above the mp3 player, so it works
[18:56:58] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: all the jQuery BELOW the mp3 player is broken, but the mp3 player and above jQuery works
[18:57:31] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: however, if we remove the code you just added, everything will work except the mp3 player
[19:00:34] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: maybe you're not one to talk about what's on your mind when you work, and that's fine; but if it doesn't bother you, I'd like to know if the extra information I'm giving you is helpful. Mostly for future reference.
[19:02:26] <jrockjiggz> sorry i don't know
[19:02:56] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: What do you think about the problem, or what have you decided is NOT the issue? I can use whatever you know.
[19:03:21] <jrockjiggz> the problem is the current version of jquery is being replaced by 1.4
[19:03:39] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: I might be able to fix that. Thanks for that info
[19:04:23] <MTPrower> jrockjiggz: what should it be? 1.6.x?
[19:04:47] <jrockjiggz> the only thing i can think of is http://pastebin.com/EHmkrXU3
[19:18:22] <GoSox> I want to perform a function when the contents of an input field change. What's the best things to use? If I use .change(), that doesn't register a change until the input field loses focus. I want changes to register as they are typed
[19:28:39] <MTPrower> Is anyone there to help with a support question? I have a WordPress site with a jQuery conflict. Having jQuery in an mp3 player breaks all the jQuery things below it. All the jQuery in the mp3 player and in stuff above the mp3 player works. http://www.vgreboot.com. There's two green lines of text that used to be a marquee. I'm guessing that would be something to look at, since it's one of the two broken things.

[20:21:55] <amh345> i've got a form that's split into 2 panels.  one panel is shown at a time and once the first panel is filled out correct the 'next' button is activated as the user can slide over to the part of the form.   the user cannot see the second part of the form because of the mask.   i've found a problem where hitting 'tab' can actually slide a part of the form over making it looked extremely messed up.  is there a way to

[22:42:38] <intellilogic> Jquery UI, I want to make a list both selectable and draggable, any advice?
[22:46:09] <chovy> my first jquery plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/5LuyB/1/
[22:46:19] <aroman> any way I can specify that all anchor tags have a certain offset when being scrolled to?
[22:47:40] <intellilogic> chovy;  grats :)
[22:48:13] <chovy> intellilogic: :)
[22:50:13] <intellilogic> chovy: I like that check to make sure jquery is there, could you write something like that for jqueryui?
[22:50:22] <intellilogic> just window.jQueryui?
[22:52:25] <chovy> i added it so i can use this in console.
[22:52:36] <chovy> on any page.
[22:53:08] <intellilogic> yes, its nice, how could I do it for jqueryui, do you know thw window.name for it?
[22:56:11] <chovy> intellilogic: looks its $.ui
[22:56:27] <chovy> i don't think it has it's own window property.
[22:56:36] <chovy> it just extends jQuery
[22:58:21] <chovy> intellilogic: what's a simple test to see if it is loaded?
[22:58:36] <chovy> $("div").draggable();
[23:01:16] <intellilogic> So I would do typeof $ui==='unbdefined'  ?
[23:03:09] <chovy> intellilogic: this works: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/5LuyB/4/
[23:03:19] <chovy> I can drag everything.
[23:03:33] <chovy> all headings anyway.
[23:03:54] <chovy> intellilogic: typeof $.ui === 'undefined'
