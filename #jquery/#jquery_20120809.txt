[00:00:52] <tw2113> libin take inspiration from this https://gist.github.com/2006007
[00:05:37] <coldhead> WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE I DON'T WANNA GIVE IT AWAY
[00:07:41] <libin> tw2113 : thats seems to be exactly what I am after.. but its not working
[00:07:59] <libin> i created a HTML file and added that code.. called jquery
[00:08:09] <libin> but nothing happens on click
[00:09:20] <ua741> Hi I have a function which I am calling on scrolling down to bottom to add new posts. The probelm which i am facing is that if I scroll to quickly then the function gets called twice sometimes with the same value of previous post.
[00:09:39] <ua741> Say funtion is fetchpostafter(int lastpostId)
[00:09:53] <coldhead> libin: are you using $(document).ready() ?
[00:10:01] <ua741> then the funtion is getting called twice for the same lastpostid if I scroll down too quickly
[00:10:04] <coldhead> are you seeing any errors in the console?
[00:11:25] <tw2113> worst case scenario, follow the logic and make it work with your code libin
[00:12:00] <libin> yes i am using document.ready
[00:12:11] <coldhead> can we see the code?
[00:12:15] <libin> thanks tw2113.. I will give it a shot and see
[00:13:37] <libin> thats the code http://jsfiddle.net/SzNf2/1/
[00:15:55] <tw2113> i forget what replaces .wait()
[00:16:00] <tw2113> .delay() ?
[00:16:26] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/SzNf2/3/
[00:16:43] * tw2113 wishes people didn't shove entire things in the html panel
[00:17:00] <tw2113> use the lower left panel for your js!
[00:17:38] <libin> thanks
[00:18:20] <tw2113> odd, it's not removing the active class
[00:19:49] <libin> its is working .,. but its stops working after u click on certain elements
[00:19:59] <tw2113> thus my bit above
[00:20:12] <libin> ya
[00:23:38] <tw2113> aha
[00:23:49] <tw2113> $(".tabs .active").removeClass("active"); needs to be $("#tabs .active").removeClass("active");
[00:24:11] <coldhead> bam
[00:24:19] <tw2113> i should update that gist
[00:26:03] <tw2113> save me future headache if i try to use it
[00:27:03] <tw2113> coldhead do you tend to open jsfiddles even if you have no intention to help with the issue?
[00:27:07] <tw2113> just to see what people are doing
[00:28:19] <Cork> doesn't every one?
[00:28:34] <tw2113> i tend to
[00:28:47] <coldhead> i always open with the intention of helping
[00:28:55] <coldhead> then if it's too fucked up i pretend i never opened it
[00:29:26] <coldhead> if i want to see what people are up to without the intention of helping i just look at what my cow orkers are doing
[00:32:02] <blackspotwiggins> cow workers, eh
[00:32:19] <blackspotwiggins> i wouldn't help one either :)
[00:34:13] <tw2113> he said cow orkers
[00:34:19] <tw2113> now to figure out what an orker is
[00:38:03] <peiper> just one thing: FUCK YOU INTERNET EXPLORER FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU
[00:38:06] <peiper> thanks for your attention.
[00:38:26] <tw2113> stop holding back
[00:40:23] <Ganentcyz> Boody hell... He has the courage to fuck IE...
[00:40:36] <coldhead> so much blood
[00:40:53] <peiper> im so freakin loaded right now
[00:41:03] <tw2113> did IE insult your mother?
[00:41:10] <tw2113> call your jquerys "spaghetti code" ?
[00:41:16] <tw2113> impregnate your this ?
[00:42:03] <peiper> its destroying my whole fucking concept
[00:42:34] <coldhead> i'm sorry to hear that
[00:42:35] <peiper> i go start a facebook party to burn down their office
[00:42:37] <tw2113> i say implement some unrelated concept for it
[00:42:43] <coldhead> you don't HAVE to support IE
[00:42:44] <tw2113> and use what you want for the good browsers
[00:43:01] <peiper> i do HAVE to support IE cause my company says so
[00:43:12] <ravenzz> what is the issue?
[00:43:20] <tw2113> like i said, give the ie losers a diff experience
[00:43:31] <coldhead> start your own company, with blackjack and hookers?
[00:44:31] <tw2113> give it the ole 'boom goes the dynamite' treatment
[00:44:48] <peiper> coldhead, good idea
[00:45:26] <ravenzz> peiper what are you trying to do?
[00:45:48] <peiper> hello my name is microsoft 33% of the world is using my browser, but i like small tits and gingers so i kick every developer in the ass with crappy support of everything
[00:46:01] <ravenzz> also you are talking about that on a js channel where (almost) everything is possible even in IE
[00:46:11] <peiper> nope it isnt
[00:46:25] <peiper> tell me how you do ajax file upload in IE without flash and php addons
[00:46:43] <peiper> let me guess... you can't ?
[00:46:56] <coldhead> you use https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/
[00:47:01] <ravenzz> ocupload works
[00:48:14] <peiper> has to fit in my framework
[00:49:06] <peiper> which doesn't work
[00:49:08] <ravenzz> use one of these plugins and write your backend
[00:49:11] <ravenzz> code
[00:49:32] <peiper> ocupload uses form submitting
[00:49:36] <ravenzz> 15minutes at most
[00:50:16] <ravenzz> well write your own plugin. it is easy anyway
[00:50:34] <peiper> you have to use xhr2 which isnt even supported in IE9
[00:50:35] <ravenzz> if you are not willing to support progress bars
[00:50:37] <ravenzz> and stuffs
[00:50:52] <peiper> well i can't allow page reloads or form submits
[00:50:59] <peiper> because this breaks my dynamic module template
[00:51:32] <ravenzz> it submit on a iframe iirc
[00:52:13] <peiper> iframes? *vomits*
[00:52:42] <ravenzz> anyway have to work, sorry
[00:53:16] <NodeX> iframes dont need page refreshes
[00:53:25] <peiper> i know
[00:53:37] <peiper> but iframes is like the w3schools of web developing
[00:53:38] <coldhead> if you use a well tested plugin like blueimp's you just apply it and forget
[00:53:56] <coldhead> it does all the IE stuff and you don't even have to be aware of the horrible iframe details
[00:54:54] <NodeX> until all browsers support methods that don't require iframes then there is nothing wrong wiht them
[00:55:03] <peiper> you know what i do now
[00:55:16] <tw2113> fuck ie in the arse
[00:55:18] <peiper> i build a frontend for ie users which looks fucking terrible
[00:55:28] <peiper> with a big red notice on every page
[00:55:33] <peiper> to use another browser
[00:55:53] <coldhead> the ol' bait & switch
[00:55:53] <ravenzz> A company charge the IE7 users 10% more of the total price
[00:56:25] <peiper> making everything IE-compatible takes like tripple the time
[00:56:29] <ravenzz> peiper you can still submit the regular way in IE, and use ajax on the kewl browsers
[00:56:49] <NodeX> what are you trying to implement?
[00:57:13] <peiper> yea ravenzz i need to do that, but my WHOLE application (which is about 200,000 lins of code and it isnt even halfway done) rely's on not a SINGLE post
[00:57:24] <peiper> everything is fluently running on api's
[00:57:29] <coldhead> 99 problems
[00:57:30] <peiper> and now this -.-
[00:57:37] <NodeX> what are you trying to implement?
[00:57:53] <peiper> ajax file upload
[00:58:05] <ravenzz> peiper so collect anything you need and then post
[00:58:19] <peiper> the kewl brothers get a dynamic system with progressbar's and stuff
[00:58:23] <NodeX> what's wrong with uploadify or the like?
[00:58:36] <ravenzz> that's the way how you are supposed to do when js is disabled
[00:58:49] <peiper> IE will get a white page with a fucking post input field and the message to install ff/chrome
[00:58:59] <tw2113> you forgot Opera
[00:59:12] <peiper> Opera is used by i guess 1% of the population?
[00:59:30] <NodeX> what's wrong with uploadify or the like?
[00:59:40] <peiper> which method uses uploadify ?
[00:59:53] <NodeX> flash iirc
[00:59:59] <peiper> flash is a no go
[01:00:09] <NodeX> then you have to use iframes
[01:00:13] <peiper> unable to use it, company says so
[01:00:37] <peiper> ill build a shitty lookin white page with a file-input field and post shit
[01:00:40] <tw2113> your company really wants to assrape users
[01:01:05] <peiper> flash is assrape by its self
[01:01:15] <NodeX> just because it's iframe doesn't mean you can't style it
[01:01:31] <peiper> no i want to make it shitty looking
[01:01:41] <peiper> people should say: damn IE looks shit
[01:02:09] <NodeX> what are you building that's 200k lines of code?
[01:02:26] <peiper> a very big framework
[01:02:32] <peiper> kinda intranet software
[01:02:44] <Lucky--> jquery session storage .data won't work for me right?
[01:08:44] <Tee_Pee> 'ello
[01:08:49] <Tee_Pee> quick question
[01:09:28] <Tee_Pee> if I do $.get(someurl.com?someparam=bla); is that equivalent to $.get(someurl.com, {someparam:bla});
[01:10:34] <NodeX> yup
[01:10:48] <Tee_Pee> Thank you.
[01:18:42] <Elephphant> Can you put attr("data") inline with html or is it only a JQuery thing
[01:23:08] <peiper> Elephphant, huh? can u provide an example?
[01:24:05] <Elephphant> peiper, <select data="id:9">    ==  $(select).data(id,9)
[01:24:47] <Elephphant> basically i need to store some data in the element (1 int, 1 string) to be picked up by a onload function
[01:25:28] <peiper> then i suggest to do this: $(select).attr('data-id', 9); to set it
[01:26:10] <Elephphant> I need to set it in a .cs file
[01:26:21] <Elephphant> as there are several, hence the need for the data
[01:26:26] <peiper> .cs = coffee script?
[01:26:34] <Elephphant> aspx.cs
[01:26:45] <peiper> outch, i'm out :P
[01:26:49] <Elephphant> haha
[01:26:57] <Elephphant> well its html essentually
[01:27:02] <Elephphant> you dont need to know aspx :p
[01:27:08] <Elephphant> asp *
[01:27:09] <peiper> ElePHPhant is using aspx :x shame on you
[01:27:40] <Elephphant> Yes I see the confliction of my name and language
[01:28:29] <Lucky--> question: simple session storage doesnt seem to work: jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BxNFy/
[01:30:59] <iheartjs> Lucky--: what's not working about it?
[01:31:12] <Lucky--> i get [object object] back in console
[01:31:15] <iheartjs> Lucky--: it's for STRING storage, so you're getitng back the string value of what you stored
[01:31:20] <Lucky--> oh lol.
[01:31:20] <Lucky--> ok
[01:32:38] <Lucky--> thxc
[01:32:47] <iheartjs> np
[01:33:07] <Lucky--> json.stringify should work fine
[01:33:10] <peiper> Elephphant, http://jsfiddle.net/AY2zT/
[01:34:59] <Lucky--> i dont get why with session storage they just didnt wrap it in .parseJSOn and stringify in the first place :-/
[01:35:21] <Elephphant> piere nice
[01:36:33] <peiper> Elephphant, question answered? and who the fuk is piere :D
[01:37:31] <Elephphant> he is a typo
[01:37:36] <Elephphant> he travels mysterious lands
[01:37:39] <iheartjs> there once was a boy named pierre, he didn't care apparently
[01:37:51] <peiper> xD
[01:38:12] <pierreee> true
[01:38:45] <peiper> omfg XD
[01:46:24] <Rudeboy> How can I group a set of functions into one variable, then batch animate it?
[01:56:33] <xec> Elephphant, peiper; FYI you can use .data() to retrieve data-* attributes - slightly shorter syntax as you dont need to type the "data-" part, and it will try to convert the string to a javascript value (like "true" becomes a boolean true) see http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[01:57:25] <Elephphant> xec, I am aware thanks. I dunno why i used attr in my example :)
[01:58:34] <rabbi1> I am still here with the validation :(
[01:58:48] <peiper> xec, good to know thanks
[01:59:00] <peiper> awww poor rabbi1
[01:59:06] <peiper> whats the problem
[02:00:30] <rabbi1> peiper: i am using ValidationEngine plugin to validate the form, working great,
[02:01:36] <xec> Rudeboy: i'm not quite sure what you're trying to do. animate a function what? :)
[02:01:56] <rabbi1> peiper: the  problem is: I have jQuery UI tabs used, and all tab form elements are in a single form. now. the validation is working good only when the tab is active and not when inactive.
[02:03:18] <rabbi1> peiper: is there any way where i can combine both the array object ? 1: the tab object 2: the fields to be validated....
[02:04:26] <peiper_> sry dc'd
[02:05:28] <rabbi1> peiper_: http://pastebin.com/7Up4HxTe
[02:07:17] <peiper_> rabbi1, eugh yea what was the problem?
[02:07:43] <rabbi1> can u see line 10? foundErrs ?
[02:07:51] <peiper_> yep
[02:08:44] <bastetmilo> Hi, I have a problem. How to make thing like this: I have 4 links and the first have class - so I want to after some time remove that class and add to next link, and repeat that. But I dont want it to stop on last element, but go to first and start again.
[02:09:16] <rabbi1> ok,that carries true or false depending on the validation, here i have check for a particular tab. the variable 'tab' carries the array object. so how can i concantinate both i.e.  tab + $this. so that the validation is done to a particular field of a particular tab .... that's it
[02:10:41] <peiper_> hmm
[02:10:57] <rabbi1> peiper_: hope you got my point ...
[02:12:30] <xec> bastetmilo: for each iteration, check if you're at the last link, and if so, go to first? shouldn't be too hard. what do you have so far?
[02:13:26] <peiper_> rabbi1, you are validating every field with .checkValid so whats the problem
[02:13:33] <xec> lunchtime, bbl ;)
[02:14:12] <bastetmilo> xec: well. I have nothing, because I dont know where to start :) (I mean I have set interval, I know how to add and remove class :))
[02:15:40] <rabbi1> peiper_: until line 10, it's perfec... but the validationEngine does validation only for the selected (active/ visible) tab. so i am trying to pass the tab to it so that it validates only mentioned tab ....
[02:16:33] <isale-eko> Kindly help, I can see fullcalender but not able to see datepicker calender on left side:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11877924/i-can-see-fullcalender-but-not-able-to-see-datepicker-calender-on-left-side

[02:19:00] <rabbi1> peiper_: http://pastebin.com/1HySuvyH
[02:19:43] <rabbi1> --tabid as i don't want to validate the first tab at any time
[02:20:27] <peiper_> your code is kinda weird
[02:21:22] <peiper_> do you want to validate the tab you click on or all
[02:22:32] <rabbi1> peiper_: all tab, (which has checkValid to it)
[02:22:47] <rabbi1> except the 1st tab, 1st tab is always ignored ....
[02:26:09] <greek> Hi fellas. I'm trying to select the text of an <a> tag according to its href (in this case... <a href='#moo'>...</a>)
[02:26:30] <Nobita> hi, http://staging.iamknighted.com/ this is my testing site, here I need that each post should have a background image depending on its date, how can I achieve this? Thanks.
[02:27:20] <isale-eko>   http://jsfiddle.net/APPtQ/   -Unable to get jquery datepicker to work.
[02:27:33] <greek> Ok I've figured it out... $('a[href$="moo"]')
[02:27:41] <greek> Thanks anyway
[02:28:41] <rabbi1> how can i target a specific element of a specific UI tab, where tab id is dynamic ?
[02:36:02] <Rudeboy> xec: I have two peices of text with opacity effects. How can I group those and then animate them. ie all effects and elements = var, then ('var').animate{...
[02:41:21] <seutje> ?add @ Rudeboy
[02:41:29] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[02:42:48] <Rudeboy> seutje: Thanks, I will see if that can solve my dilemma :)
[02:44:58] <xec> bastetmilo:  .addClass() and .removeClass() are both pretty straightforward
[02:46:55] <xec> Rudeboy: three ways, either do what seutje linked you for adding two selections together, or simply do two calls after eachother (animations are async so two consecutive calls will run at the same time) or make your selector select both (or all) elements you want to animate
[02:47:42] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys
[02:47:45] <seutje> I'd prefer using a single collection for maintainability
[02:47:57] <Wiz_KeeD> can ANYONE make this stupid timepicker work? i've lost my mind with it!
[02:47:58] <Wiz_KeeD> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[02:48:10] <Wiz_KeeD> the datepicker works, not the timepicker on
[02:48:28] <Wiz_KeeD> http://pastie.org/4428243
[02:49:20] <alicefreak> Here is my jsfiddle. Its displaying "hello world" only one time. Am I missing something? thanks http://jsfiddle.net/BXWkD/1/
[02:50:15] <xec> bastetmilo: you can use something like .is(":last-child") for checking if an element is the last child (assuming the links are all the siblings)
[02:50:57] <alicefreak> it should be two
[02:51:10] <seutje> alicefreak: you're setting the HTML to the same value twice
[02:51:12] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone?
[02:51:17] <Wiz_KeeD> pls?
[02:51:31] <seutje> alicefreak: this what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/BXWkD/2/
[02:52:01] <alicefreak> seutje, thanks let me try
[02:52:27] <Wiz_KeeD> timepicker anyone?
[02:52:49] <faraway> Wiz_KeeD: does the console report any error ?
[02:52:57] <Wiz_KeeD> it does not faraway
[02:52:59] <seutje> alicefreak: .html('foo') is like saying I want the content to be replaced by 'foo', using .append('foo') is like saying I want to add 'foo' to the end of the content.
[02:53:02] <Wiz_KeeD> and the console.log works
[02:53:07] <Rudeboy> xec: Ok great, thank you :)
[02:53:29] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: I can't tell from your paste what's going wrong - can you make it a live demo instead?
[02:54:06] <Wiz_KeeD> i would love to make a pf but i'm behind a router and can't do that
[02:54:24] <Wiz_KeeD> no errors, everything included idk what's wrong it just won't budge
[02:54:27] <alicefreak> seutje, If we use .append function then it will create long list.
[02:54:27] <xec> pf?
[02:54:29] <xec> Wiz_KeeD: try jsfiddle.net
[02:55:01] <CreativeDev> Don't know if I can report bugs for jqueryUI here: if so, please let me know :D
[02:55:02] <seutje> alicefreak: isn't that what you're trying to do?
[02:55:49] <alicefreak> seutje, no. I just to want to print one time. something like that first it clear the div then append new result
[02:56:02] <CreativeDev> or have I report them in the dev-channels?
[02:56:24] <CreativeDev> lol *must
[02:56:54] <xec> CreativeDev: if you're positive it is indeed a bug you can check if it's already reported at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[02:56:57] <seutje> alicefreak: aaah
[02:57:14] <seutje> alicefreak: like so? http://jsfiddle.net/BXWkD/3/
[02:57:55] <alicefreak> seutje, yes. thanks alot :-)
[02:58:14] <CreativeDev> xec: thanks, but I didn't find s.o. related to it there ;)
[02:58:37] <alicefreak> seutje, never heard about push. I'll read
[02:58:53] <seutje> alicefreak: it's to add elements to the end of an array
[02:59:01] <seutje> ?mdn array.push
[02:59:04] <seutje> bot?
[02:59:29] <seutje> alicefreak: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[02:59:44] <alicefreak> seutje, thanks :-)
[03:00:07] <stefuNz> hey. is there a way to detect position changes of a certain element? i mean, i could poll for that, but is there an event for that?
[03:02:27] <ak> is there some best practice to resctrict input fields to a set of characters?
[03:04:25] <Wiz_KeeD> xec, here it is damn it
[03:04:25] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jsfiddle.net/dbrCf/3/
[03:05:17] <rabbi1> seutje: i have 'var x = [input#elementid.elementclass]' and 'var y = [div#tabid.tabclass]' how can i get 'var z = x + y' ? i.e. [div#tabid.tabclass][input#elementid.elementclass] ...... and with this can i apply styles for the element ?
[03:06:29] <Wiz_KeeD> any ideeas xec ?
[03:06:36] <Cork> if its only used by modern browsers you can simply do <input ... maxlength="length">
[03:06:49] <seutje> rabbi1: WAT? var x = [input#elementid.elementclass]; give me a syntax error
[03:06:54] <Cork> ak: ^
[03:07:15] <rabbi1> seutje: but that's what i get in my console.log(x) :(
[03:07:25] <ak> thx Cork, but i mean, to a set of characters, like only a-z and Ã¶Ã¤Ã¼ÃŸ
[03:08:02] <Cork> ak: pattern="regex" :)
[03:08:15] <ak> ah thx
[03:08:20] <Cork> ak: but again, that doesn't even work in all latest versions
[03:08:34] <ak> maybe some js solution?
[03:08:38] <rabbi1> seutje: i have just put the output of x and y what i get in the console.log
[03:08:39] <Cork> ak: there are a few libs that backports those tags through js
[03:08:48] <Cork> ak: that might be the cleanest solution
[03:09:09] <ak> can you name me such a lib, so i can google for it?
[03:09:32] <Cork> i think modernizr does it
[03:09:51] <ak> okay i check
[03:20:51] <seutje> rabbi1: oh, so x and y are just jQuery collections?
[03:21:36] <seutje> then I guess you're looking for http://api.jquery.com/add/
[03:22:05] <seutje> note that add creates a new set and doesn't manipulate the existing set
[03:22:19] <seutje> so z = x.add(y);
[03:22:40] <seutje> or $(x).add(y) if it's not a jQuery collection but just a reference to an element
[03:24:16] <flam_> &w 4
[03:24:22] <rabbi1> seutje: thanks, will have a look
[03:25:12] <planet_en> can anyone tell me why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/najamkhn/BWXHx/3/
[03:25:55] <ML74> Could I get some help with jquery.ajax form posting?
[03:26:21] <ML74> here's my current code: http://pastebin.com/KhG0m195
[03:26:24] <flam_> just ask
[03:26:41] <ML74> there's nothing currently prints in the console, so i assume there's no return from the ajax post
[03:26:44] <seutje> planet_en: DbzGlobal isn't defined?
[03:27:06] <planet_en> seutje:  yea and not used either..
[03:27:16] <planet_en> it should still work..
[03:27:25] <seutje> sure it is, you're passing it to your anonymous function
[03:27:44] <seutje> it's like saying var foo = function() {}; foo(someUndefinedVariable);
[03:27:54] <planet_en> seutje: so even if I remove it, it doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/najamkhn/BWXHx/4/
[03:28:25] <seutje> planet_en: it works for me
[03:28:32] <seutje> unless it's supposed to do more than just the append
[03:28:46] <planet_en> i swear it wasnt working for last 20 mins or so
[03:29:09] <planet_en> its working now :s
[03:29:47] <planet_en> can I use this instead of window inside the anonymous scope?
[03:29:55] <planet_en> `this` *
[03:30:13] <seutje> sure, but you can't guarantee it's not something else
[03:30:36] <planet_en> seutje: but same goes for window too
[03:31:24] <seutje> chances of the this context being hosed are far greater afaik
[03:32:12] <seutje> but I mean, if you have full control over the entire application, it's probably safe to use it, but I wouldn't
[03:36:06] <ML74> i'm trying to use jquery.ajax to post to a php script, but receiving the "XMLHttpRequest cannot loadâ€¦" error. how can i fix this?
[03:36:38] <coldhead> i have never seen that error
[03:36:55] <coldhead> can you show the jQuery code you are using?
[03:37:46] <ML74> http://pastebin.com/rLCQ32uH
[03:38:40] <hrwath> "cannot load..."?
[03:38:59] <hrwath> what's the full error message?
[03:39:30] <ML74> "[php script]. Origin [domain] is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[03:42:32] <coldhead> you're seeing that error on the server?
[03:43:41] <ML74> in the javascript console
[03:45:06] <blackspotwiggins> ML74, you cant do cross-site requests
[03:45:27] <ML74> it's not cross site though
[03:45:29] <ML74> it's the same domain
[03:51:50] <coldhead> i don't understand how the JS error is aware of the "php script"
[03:52:13] <coldhead> do you have a live demo?
[03:55:28] <ML74> got it sorted
[03:55:37] <ML74> although, getting something else now
[03:55:58] <ML74> what is the data returned? how can i call that?
[04:00:44] <coldhead> ML74: change success: function() { to success: function(my_datas) {
[04:00:54] <coldhead> and then you can access my_datas within the function
[04:01:12] <ML74> ok
[04:01:30] <coldhead> good luck
[04:02:29] <pielgrzym> hi, I'm trying to implement some drag'n'drop upload - I bind dragover for my div and inside this event I take backup all html from the div and replace it with some text. Unfortunately despite stopPropagation() this dragover event callback is being bound to every subelement of the div I'm working with. how to prevent binding to subelements??
[04:04:12] <jita> I want to implement whiteboard in 1 to 1 chat room. Something like http://imgur.com/tMHAB, I am using pusher for text chat, tokobox for video, what should i use for drawing board?
[04:10:13] <pielgrzym> ah, drag events in html5 are seriously flawed :/ the guy who made them so should punch himself in the face. 20 time a day for the next 5 years.
[04:10:52] <ML74> coldhead: how do i return data back? just print it in the php script?
[04:11:12] <coldhead> ML74: use json, is usually the best way
[04:11:23] <ML74> coldhead: how's that work?
[04:11:54] <coldhead> ML74: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[04:12:12] <coldhead> jita: http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/
[04:12:17] <ML74> coldhead: i just need to return Y or N as a string :/
[04:13:24] <Rudeboy> xec: I've got this so far, but I can't get them to run together, would you mind checking it quickly?
[04:13:25] <Rudeboy> http://pastebin.com/easmygYV
[04:13:53] <jita> coldhead, how can i share this with 2 users ?
[04:15:25] <coldhead> ML74: echo json_decode(array('status' => $y_or_no));
[04:15:37] <coldhead> then my_datas.status in js land
[04:15:56] <coldhead> jita: there is a multi user version as well but it's down >: |
[04:16:17] <coldhead> pielgrzym: can you just use this stuff? http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[04:16:26] <coldhead> that's what i'd do, as lazily as possible
[04:16:54] <coldhead> my benzine is kicking in, team, i'd better leave you to it
[04:16:59] <coldhead> good luck all yall
[04:18:18] <Rudeboy> What's Benzine?
[04:18:27] <xec> Rudeboy: when you run to consecutive animations on the same element they will be queued after eachother. you can either do both the animations in the same .animate() call or disable the queue option. check out the former here: http://jsfiddle.net/ZL3b4/1/
[04:19:39] <ML74> coldhead: what's the dataType? json just?
[04:20:59] <Rudeboy> xec: Oh awesome, shot. I didn't know you could use opacity in animate:)
[04:21:34] <xec> s/to/two
[04:21:52] <Rudeboy> xec: Works a treat :)
[04:21:57] <xec> good :)
[04:26:11] <BorgK> need some newGuyUsingJS here.... how to identify diferent inputs inside a form having the form? using the name? how?
[04:26:37] <ML74> could someone give me a hand with ajax form submission with a return? http://pastebin.com/Kpif1BjW is the js. and all is in the PHP file at the minute is: json_decode(array('status' => "Y")); . any ideas?
[04:27:04] <Cork> BorgK: well you could select them based on the name attribute
[04:28:47] <Cork> ML74: check the response message in your network tab to see what the server actually sends
[04:28:57] <Cork> thats often the simplest way to solve it
[04:29:44] <ML74> Cork: ahhh. never knew that existed lol
[04:29:56] <ML74> Cork: "Warning: json_decode() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in [location]"
[04:30:43] <Cubix> ML74: decode will take a string... what your trying to do, is encode :)
[04:30:50] <Tee_Pee> Heya again
[04:31:03] <Cubix> thus: json_encode(array('status' => "Y")); will work :)
[04:31:05] <Tee_Pee> Jquery Mobile question:
[04:31:07] <ML74> Cork: so i should have json_encode() in the php file
[04:31:11] <ML74> ahhhh, cheers Cubix
[04:31:41] <Tee_Pee> since changePage essentially just takes pages and loads them into the index.html, memory managment of all the javascripts becomes an issue.
[04:31:52] <Tee_Pee> I can't just include all of my JS into the index.html as there's quite a lot of it.
[04:32:21] <Tee_Pee> What I'm wondering is - if I changePage to page2.html and loads its JS, once I change to page3.html will that JS be cleared from memory?
[04:32:39] <Tee_Pee> Or will it remain, as it's technically part of index.html
[04:38:03] <BorgK> [Cork] how to diferent inputs of te same tipe by their names inside the form? Something like $('theInputNameInHere') ?
[04:38:58] <Cork> $form_element.find('input[name="this-is-the-name"]').val()
[04:39:29] <Cork> BorgK: but you should try to use the form as a jquery object so you don't have to search the entire dom tree
[04:40:15] <Cork> that is var form = $('form'); form.find('input[]') instead of $('form input[]') for each input
[04:40:23] <Cork> the later is much heavier to do
[04:42:49] <seutje> or make a single collection containing all your inputs and then filter it on the name when you need them
[04:44:02] <BorgK> yep, i already had the form in a var prepared to then submit it, but before i had to change a couple of hidden input values and didn't know how to access them, ty^^ it works nice now
[05:07:03] <Flo0815> hey guys, how can i execute sth liek this: callback: function(){

[05:08:03] <klawd_prime> hi!
[05:08:08] <Flo0815> hi
[05:08:17] <klawd_prime> is there a live event as to when an element is inserted into the dom tree?
[05:08:24] <klawd_prime> like .live('init') or something?
[05:08:54] <Flo0815> dunno
[05:08:55] <Flo0815> sry
[05:13:28] <Flo0815> hello? anybody out there?
[05:13:39] <Flo0815> how can i execute a function stored in a variable?
[05:14:02] <Flo0815> callback: function(){ dothis; do that;}
[05:14:08] <klawd_prime> var foo = function() {alert('bar') }();
[05:14:08] <Flo0815> callback(); won't work
[05:14:08] <klawd_prime> or
[05:14:15] <klawd_prime> var foo = function() {alert('bar') }; foo();
[05:14:31] <Flo0815> and if it's storded in an object?
[05:14:38] <klawd_prime> foo.bar()
[05:14:46] <klawd_prime> show your code
[05:14:51] <Flo0815> {foo: function(){dothis;: do that;}}?
[05:15:11] <klawd_prime> don't you have a debugger?
[05:15:20] <klawd_prime> that is syntactically just plain wrong.
[05:15:44] <klawd_prime> show your actual code
[05:15:50] <Flo0815> sec
[05:15:51] <juha_> Flo0815: callback.call()
[05:16:41] <Flo0815> http://jsfiddle.net/qvKA2/
[05:18:27] <Flo0815> juha_: console says: callback.call is not a function
[05:19:15] <thinced> foo.callback();?
[05:20:03] <Flo0815> thinced, yes thats the normal
[05:20:04] <Flo0815> way
[05:20:12] <Flo0815> i think i have to rethink my code
[05:20:19] <Flo0815> i'm confused right now^^

[05:21:02] <klawd_prime> http://jsfiddle.net/qvKA2/2/
[05:21:04] <klawd_prime> works fine.
[05:21:21] <Flo0815> yes
[05:21:22] <Flo0815> i know
[05:21:31] <Flo0815> it's another pproblem
[05:21:39] <klawd_prime> i think so too.
[05:21:41] <Flo0815> :)
[05:21:49] <thinced> yes
[05:21:50] <thinced> :)
[05:22:18] <Flo0815> it's like this: i have a html element which has an attribute callback="function(){ dothis; dothat;}"
[05:22:27] <Flo0815> and now i want to execute this function
[05:23:36] <Rickardo1> I have coded a tooltip function.. my problem is that onmouseout doesn't keep up when moving the mouse fast..
[05:24:17] <Flo0815> Rickardo1: .stop()
[05:25:00] <juha_> Flo0815: you need to use eval on that and also eval is evil
[05:25:07] <Flo0815> uargh
[05:25:23] <Flo0815> ok i need a workaround
[05:25:25] <Flo0815> thx

[06:46:48] <faraway> _martin: you should probably first learn a little bit javascript before you go to deep into jquery. (especially variable scopes and what closures are)
[06:46:57] <ShawnRisk> If I do $(e.target).load('videourl'); videourl = $(e.target).attr('href');Â I get this error: {"error": "Please use POST request"} I know this mean it need a POST request but unsure how to do this properly for a any videos.  Any ideas on how to fix this?
[06:48:38] <faraway> ShawnRisk: what happens if you try to open the url you want to load in you browser
[06:50:19] <ShawnRisk> faraway: To test out I am just using a youtube video, which loads in my browser but I have tested with a MP4 file and this gives me the same error and loads in my browser.
[06:50:19] <faraway> ShawnRisk: i would guess, that this is the status response form the server you try to load the data form
[06:50:44] <faraway> ShawnRisk: you you make a jsfiddle example that shows that problem ?
[06:50:53] <faraway> ShawnRisk: could you ?
[06:51:59] <eregi> I'm Trying to slideDown a div after updating it's contents with get function, but the div doesn't animate properly, I assume that it tries to slide down before content is updatet. Can anyone please help? http://pastebin.com/SYt4c8h9
[06:53:08] <faraway> eregi: not properly means what ?
[06:53:18] <Rawet> what is it called when you disable click on a certain object.. like if i got this menu up i dont want to be able to click on anything outside the menu
[06:55:07] <ShawnRisk> faraway: here it the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BK9V2/5/ the problem is that now it loads the text as a link which is crazy but if I hit the Run button it gives me the error I put here.
[06:55:23] <eregi> faraway, it doesn't slidedown, it 'drops', the effect doesn't appear, the div just appears visible
[06:59:33] <RyChiss> Can someone tell me why my javascript/jquery stopped working? http://sa.eyeink.com/test/
[07:01:09] <Brodingo> RyChiss jquery isnt loaded
[07:01:15] <Douglish> Hello everybody, I'm trying to stringify XML received from jQuery.ajax, anyway it fails and produces different string. Code is here http://pastebin.com/qY6YuARV
[07:01:36] <RyChiss> Brodingo: I'm confused because i've been testing this same script for like 2 weeks
[07:02:04] <RyChiss> Brodingo: and I havent modified the header
[07:02:24] <Brodingo> well jquery isnt loaded
[07:02:29] <Brodingo> Douglish thats not jquery?
[07:03:32] <Brodingo> RyChiss check the console and you can see the js errors
[07:04:43] <abletony84> yo.. got this nasty bug here.. http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/5kGu5/1/ - i got 3 divs whose photos are meant to change as you hover its thumbnails - but why does it hide the photos from the other 2 divs (until you hover them)?
[07:06:22] <RyChiss> Brodingo: Thanks a lot
[07:06:50] <Brodingo> not sure if genuine
[07:07:32] <DarsVaeda> hi, I use a jquery ui slider, have styled it with a different handle and find it very difficult to select the max value at the "end" of the slider
[07:08:07] <Brodingo> abletony84 your collections are including the other uls, try doing an each for the uls so the code only applies to their children
[07:08:44] <abletony84> Brodingo: got it, 2 seconds
[07:09:39] <faraway> ShawnRisk: cause you pass the string 'videourl'  and not the variable videourl
[07:10:51] <ShawnRisk> faraway: if I do just videourl, nothing happens.
[07:14:25] <faraway> ShawnRisk: thats what i say you can do corss domain requests
[07:14:42] <ShawnRisk> faraway: can or can't?
[07:14:50] <faraway> ShawnRisk: can't
[07:15:17] <ShawnRisk> faraway: what is the best option than?
[07:15:51] <abletony84> Brodingo: var i = $(this).parent().each().children().index(this);?
[07:15:55] <faraway> ShawnRisk: best way to do that is to request the cross domain data through your server
[07:16:07] <cloudpopup> using .bind for events is better, since you dont "replace" any old events, right?
[07:16:34] <ShawnRisk> faraway: how?
[07:17:53] <faraway> ShawnRisk: http://yourdomain.tld/requestdata?url=http://www.someotherdomain.tld/the/path
[07:18:07] <faraway> ShawnRisk: then on your server request this data and return it
[07:19:23] <faraway> ShawnRisk: how definitily depends on the lanugage you use on the server, and you should ask on the corresponding channel
[07:19:50] <faraway> ShawnRisk: you can also use the apaches rewriterules
[07:20:24] <ShawnRisk> faraway: here is the overall picture I am trying to do.   I want to do is make this: http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/ in which I append a play button to each image, to play the video automatically, meaning without going to another page.  I want the video to play in that slider.
[07:20:41] <ShawnRisk> faraway: yep I know how to do the requestdata part and can ask the other channels for sure
[07:22:00] <faraway> ShawnRisk: then why don't you just extract the video id form the link and build the embed code out of that ?
[07:23:34] <abletony84> Brodingo: my urls were messed up, fixed here though http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/5kGu5/2/
[07:23:44] <ShawnRisk> faraway: did you see the embedded code in the jsfiddle?  I am not sure how to do that.
[07:23:58] <abletony84> Brodingo: tried .each() pretty much everywhere though without getting it right
[07:24:25] <Brodingo> what are you trying exactly abletony84 ?
[07:25:48] <abletony84> Brodingo: var i = $(this).parent().each().children().index(this);
[07:26:07] <abletony84> hmmm
[07:26:17] <ctj> Would someone perhaps be able to provide a little assistance for me? I'm bloody stuck.
[07:26:28] <Brodingo> nevermind, ummm it would probably make for easier coding to use some classes with the two uls
[07:26:52] <abletony84> cool
[07:27:01] <Brodingo> and use an each for .photo so any javascript functionality only applies within
[07:27:13] <ctj> Fuck it I'm just gonna go ahead and ask anyway.
[07:27:42] <faraway> ShawnRisk: you cannot do this with iframe, you need to use the swfobject

[07:28:40] <drummer306> hi, if I open an external link in jquery mobile how do I have the back button in the browser direct back to the jquery styled page ?  right now when going back it defaults to a normal page and not the jquery mobile enabled version
[07:29:02] <drummer306> I assume this is something i need to add in the jquery start up or on each page
[07:29:04] <ShawnRisk> faraway: would you be able to show me how to do this?
[07:29:25] <faraway> ShawnRisk: https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference#Embedding
[07:29:54] <abletony84> Brodingo: i probably got you all wrong but like this? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/5kGu5/3/
[07:30:20] <Brodingo> you should check the proper usage of each
[07:30:22] <Brodingo> ?each
[07:30:36] <faraway> ShawnRisk:  http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/
[07:30:39] <Brodingo> :/
[07:31:00] <abletony84> ah yeah i see it now
[07:31:10] <sonnie> hi, how to select all checkboxes with "checked=checked"?
[07:31:33] <ctj> So I'm writing an object constructor that uses information from the page to construct itself, and I'm having some trouble. My dilemma is basically something like this: function obConstruct () { var f = ['some', 'value']; $(f).each(function () { //the problem being that I need to change some properties of the object I'm trying to construct right here, in this function. }); }
[07:32:14] <ctj> Since this is used for the current item in the array, I can't just change the object like you would normally (this.color = "red")
[07:32:28] <abletony84> Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/5kGu5/4/ closing in!
[07:32:30] <ShawnRisk> faraway: I get what you are saying but not all of my videos will be youtube so it will be hard to make them all into swfobjects if I am correct.  These might be mp4 or ogg or others.
[07:32:38] <ctj> Is it possible for me to dick with the object I'm trying to construct from within $.each()?
[07:32:48] <sonnie> got it.
[07:33:10] <ajpiano> ctj: first of all, use $.each( obj, fn ) to iterate over a regular array or object, not $( obj ) each
[07:33:16] <ajpiano> ctj: second, yes, just refer to "f"
[07:33:19] <faraway> ShawnRisk: then you need to check what url is is and depending on the url call different loading script
[07:34:26] <christo_m> I'd like to target specific time cells in Full Calendar and make them a different color (specifically for showing which time blocks are allowed and which aren't) I can't see an easy way to do this unless im specifically targeting the cells with jquery
[07:34:37] <ajpiano> ctj: var f = {foo: bar};  $.each( f, function(key, val) { f.baz = "bang"; })
[07:34:59] <ShawnRisk> faraway: There is no one way fits all?
[07:35:31] <christo_m> It looks like fc-widget-content is what's used by fullcalendar to generate the cells, im looking for any easy way to do this without hacknig the fullcalendar.js code, anyone know?
[07:35:57] <ctj> ajpiano: In the object construction function I use $.each(), and I need to change properties of the constructing object from within $.each().
[07:36:10] <ajpiano> what is the "constructing object"
[07:36:23] <ctj> the object that is being constructed by the function
[07:36:35] <ajpiano> just refer to it
[07:36:39] <ajpiano> var that = this;
[07:36:46] <ctj> that's the problem though
[07:36:50] <ctj> normally you would just use this
[07:36:53] <ajpiano> $.each( foo, function() { that.bar = "baz"; })
[07:36:56] <ajpiano> so alias it
[07:37:07] <ctj> this is something else in $.each()\
[07:37:10] <ajpiano> or use $.proxy to make it so the $.each runs with the outer 'this' as its scope
[07:37:31] <ajpiano> $.each( foo, $.proxy(function() {}, this))
[07:37:42] <faraway> ShawnRisk: probably there is a jquery plugin that does the handling for youtube, viemo or others for you, but i don't know
[07:37:50] <ajpiano> ctj:  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[07:38:12] <ShawnRisk> faraway: thank you

[07:41:41] <abletony84> fucking awesome man
[07:41:56] <abletony84> i noticed my fiddle update skipped from 4 to 6 and i was like whaaa?
[07:41:59] <abletony84> Brodingo: how much do i owe you?
[07:42:08] <Brodingo> bout three fitty
[07:42:19] <Crimlo> what exactly did he do?
[07:42:26] <faraway> ShawnRisk:  the only additional thing that i have found in my bookmarks about this
[07:42:59] <abletony84> three fitty??
[07:43:07] <abletony84> i can do three five
[07:43:27] <abletony84> if you pm me your paypal

[07:43:55] <m8> :O
[07:44:54] <Brodingo> you were really johnny on the spot with that
[07:46:19] <ShawnRisk> faraway: thank you, I will see what I can do.  It is a hard problem
[07:47:14] <ctj> ajpiano: here is my problem: http://i.imgur.com/pJiST.png
[07:47:27] <drummer306> so i guess my problem with jquery mobile is its not creating the hash links, which is why bookmarks and going back doesnt work
[07:47:44] <ajpiano> ctj: seriously dude
[07:47:49] <ctj> srsly
[07:47:52] <ajpiano> read all the comments i've directed to you
[07:47:56] <ctj> i have
[07:48:02] <ctj> I'M STILL CONFUSED MAN
[07:48:26] <ajpiano> why are you using $(q).each(fn) instead of $.each( q, fn) if you listened to what i said
[07:48:55] <ajpiano> ctj: also why would you post me an image of code instead of a pastebin
[07:49:09] <ctj> BECAUSE I WANTED TO DRAW
[07:49:16] <ctj> anyway
[07:49:32] <ctj> I didn't think there was a difference between $(a).each(fn) and $.each(a, fn)
[07:49:58] <ajpiano> well, there is
[07:50:46] <ctj> so do I have to use $.proxy()?
[07:51:16] <ajpiano> function otherStuff() { var q = [1,2,3];  $.each( q, $.proxy(function(index, number) { this.foo = 5+number;  }, this));
[07:51:22] <ajpiano> ctj: either proxy or var that = this;
[07:51:51] <ctj> brb tryin
[07:52:22] <Teduardo> is there a simple way to load a page at URL after interval?
[07:53:50] <ctj> ajpiano: Oh that's fucking glorious
[07:53:52] <ctj> thank you
[08:01:43] <faraway> Teduardo: in a new window or the same window ?
[08:02:09] <ScottG> I'm trying to figure out why I'm getting spacing between my cells. It's definitely possible because if I "Normalize CSS" the cell spacing goes away. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/WrFWT/1/
[08:05:02] <Anticom> hi all
[08:05:07] <Anticom> any plugin devs here?
[08:05:13] <faraway> ScottG: with css only http://jsfiddle.net/WrFWT/2/  but not sure which browser version support this
[08:05:38] <webdev> hello all.
[08:05:59] <Anticom> i'm currently writing a small plugin and in there i could overwrite some existing css-rules... so i want to store them, if the properties already exist... my problem is, i don't know where to declare the variable to store them
[08:06:57] <ScottG> faraway: Ah I tried that before but I was doing it on the td, tr, th elements themselves. Thanks.
[08:07:21] <faraway> ScottG: for all browsers it is cellspacing as an attribute for table tag
[08:08:13] <quicksilver> ScottG: for compliant browsers your only problem was that border-spacing needs to be on the table, not the cells
[08:08:32] <quicksilver> however, to get reliable effects with old IE versions you do need the border-collapse
[08:08:46] <ScottG> quicksilver: ohhhhh. That's kinda confusing but I can see it working either way...
[08:18:23] <Toasty> Can somebody explain to me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/xJ4dG/
[08:18:50] <Toasty> Alert outputs both fields as expected. The GET is picked up by PHP just fine, the POST isn't. Even removing the entire GET section doesn't fix it.
[08:19:39] <ShawnRisk> Toasty: I can't see anything in that jsfiddle, as all you have is he jquery and nothing else
[08:20:27] <fanthomas> Toasty: may be it is a PHP question?
[08:20:32] <quicksilver> Toasty: well the questions that spring to mind are, is "accept.value" a properly formatted POST? what is your server expecting in the message body?
[08:20:49] <Toasty> The server simply writes the requests to file
[08:20:58] <Toasty> I'll send
[08:21:35] <Toasty> http://jsfiddle.net/xJ4dG/1/
[08:21:48] <Toasty> I've added the PHP to the bottom. Simply foreach's POST and GET
[08:21:54] <Toasty> appends it to a file
[08:22:03] <quicksilver> you didn't really answer my question
[08:22:10] <quicksilver> I suspect you don't understand HTTP or how POSTs work.
[08:22:30] <quicksilver> Is accept.value a properly formatted POST body? What kind of POST body does your server expect?
[08:22:48] <quicksilver> For example, is it application/x-www-form-urlencoded ?
[08:23:00] <quicksilver> probably not really jquery questions now.
[08:23:19] <ShawnRisk> Toasty: create a nice looking jsfiddle or we can not help you.
[08:23:25] <Toasty> My point is that it just worked, and then it stopped working -- I changed nothing with it in the process but added the GET
[08:23:54] <Toasty> How do I create a nice JS fiddle? I can't post the code on the site, it's not my code to post. I'm trying to debug it
[08:25:29] <ShawnRisk> Toasty: who's code is it?
[08:25:35] <midrori-ru> how to get images like scr="foo.com/*" ?
[08:25:38] <midrori-ru> its really?
[08:25:50] <Toasty> It's my work's code
[08:25:53] <fanthomas> Toasty: what's inside accept.value ?
[08:26:01] <Toasty> Where do I specify that?
[08:28:51] <Toasty> Now the cops are here
[08:29:39] <ezio> looooool

[08:39:50] <Anticom> .width() seems to be buggy on a non-styled div, or is that a browser issue?
[08:40:02] <Anticom> i'm getting somewhat near screen width but not element-width
[08:40:25] <Anticom> same with .outerWidt() btw
[08:40:36] <Anticom> any ideas on how to solve that?
[08:40:59] <seutje> rabbi1: I told you it doesn't mutate the original object, but instead returns the new set
[08:41:23] <seutje> rabbi1: so var z = $(x).add(y); and z will be the combined set, not x
[08:41:51] <rabbi1> seutje: i tried $(x).add(y) that just gives me this '[div#tabid.tabclass, input#elementid.elementclass ]' instead of '[div#tabid.tabclass input#elementid.elementclass]
[08:42:13] <rabbi1> it is $z = $(x).add(y) only
[08:42:39] <seutje> wait what? o.O
[08:42:50] <seutje> you want both in a single array key?
[08:42:57] * seutje flips the table

[08:43:20] <seutje> ?gwlt
[08:43:21] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "gwlt" in jQuery Docs.
[08:43:22] <rabbi1> I need this  '[div#tabid.tabclass input#elementid.elementclass]
[08:43:29] <seutje> good luck with that
[08:44:02] <eregi> Any ideas what's wrong in this code? http://pastebin.com/vq807aQK The slideDown method doesn't work, it kinda jumps, I assume that it's because of the order when the function is called. If I later hide that element and just slide it without updating content, then the slideDown method works without problems.
[08:46:29] <xec_> rabbi1: may i ask what you're really trying to do?
[08:46:44] <rabbi1> xec_: tab validation
[08:48:03] <rabbi1> xec_: http://pastebin.com/gXj5E3Lc
[08:48:21] <eregi> anyone, please?
[08:49:41] <xec_> eregi: looks like you're doing .slideDown() before the content is fetched from the server and inserted
[08:49:50] <xec_> ?ajax101
[08:49:50] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:50:09] <glontu> hi
[08:50:15] <glontu> i have a weird problem
[08:50:18] <xec_> eregi: same concept as that link
[08:50:57] <xec_> eregi: so, move the slideDown call to inside the end of the $.get() callback rather than after it
[08:51:01] <glontu> i have a form and i split it into tabs and show each section of the form inside of a tab. Problem is that on the last tab i want to show another form. If i just write a new form inside the last tab that new form will be included in form1 and that is a problem
[08:51:12] <glontu> how do i make this work without having cascaded forms ?
[08:51:30] <glontu> by the way ... i am using jquery-ui's tabs
[08:52:13] <joaojeronimo> Guys, my error and success functions in $.ajax are not firing... this is my code: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1137987/ is something wrong with it ?
[08:53:10] <xec_> glontu: you're basically asking "how can I nest forms" while it also looks like you already know that you can't
[08:53:52] <glontu> xec_, indeed i know that but i still want to have form1 displayed on the first 3 tabs and form2 on the 4th tab
[08:53:55] <glontu> any ideeas ?
[08:54:03] <eregi> xec_, which is the callback function? after "json" I should add function (){//do the slidedown}?
[08:54:35] <xec_> eregi: on line four, you have a $.get() statement, right?
[08:54:52] <eregi> xec_ yes
[08:54:58] <xec_> eregi: where you pass two arguments. one is the url and the second is the callback
[08:56:21] <eregi> xec_ did that, moved $("#eventInfo"+selectedId).slideDown(1000); before }, "json"); still the same problem
[08:58:02] <xec_> eregi: hmm, maybe something else going wrong then. do you have a live url to look at?
[08:58:12] <rabbi1> xec_: any help ?
[08:58:34] <shoky> joaojeronimo: you need to use either .fail() or .ajaxError()
[08:59:07] <nevin> Is there a cleaner more efficient way to write this jquery in this example http://jsfiddle.net/W5W6h/?
[08:59:24] <xec_> rabbi1: tbh i'm not sure what's going on in that paste
[08:59:41] <silverwind> nevin: Start by caching your selectors..
[09:00:28] <rabbi1> xec_: i just have to concatenate  2 variables: 1 is a div and other is a input element, how can i do it ?
[09:00:48] <silverwind> nevin: And the || operator exists
[09:01:13] <rabbi1> xec_: which should output  '[div#tabid.tabclass input#elementid.elementclass]
[09:01:18] <rabbi1> in the console
[09:01:35] <xec_> rabbi1: what? why
[09:03:22] <rabbi1> can u see foundErrs in the code? that is validating each element and flag is stored, but it's validating only for selected (active) tab,. but need to do it to all tabs, so i am trying to pass a tabid + elementid to it. so that it validates the tabs, without restricting to only 'selected' ones
[09:04:12] <xec_> rabbi1: what exactly does the .validationEngine() do?
[09:04:54] <rabbi1> it validates the element and returns true or false
[09:05:38] <rabbi1> if its element.validationEngine('validate') and same if its form.validationEngine('validate');
[09:05:39] <xec_> rabbi1: ok and you're filling $checkValids with the elements you want to check, correct?
[09:05:50] <rabbi1> xec_: exactly
[09:05:53] <abletony84> hey how do i give the "Testing" header at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/vyNVN/1/ class="fixed" after one has scrolled down below it - like http://www.pinterest.com's header?
[09:06:01] <Wolf_22> Is it possible to add an HTML element adjacent to another using jQuery?
[09:06:07] <xec_> rabbi1: so why are you filling it with only elements from a single tab?
[09:06:15] <rabbi1> its working good. no problem with the validation, only problem is it is validating only if the tab is selected....
[09:06:23] <shoky> joaojeronimo: actually those don't seem to work. though the docs say they should
[09:07:01] <Wolf_22> Nevermind... I see the after() function now on the jQuery site. :)
[09:07:04] <rabbi1> xec_: http://pastebin.com/1HySuvyH
[09:07:12] <ravenzz> ?scroll @ abletony84
[09:07:12] <bot-t> abletony84, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[09:07:19] <joaojeronimo> shoky: I tried those first on $.getScript but didn't work.. let me try on $.ajax....
[09:07:57] <joaojeronimo> shoky: exactly, the docs also say the error and success functions defined the argument of $.ajax should work...
[09:07:58] <ravenzz> joaojeronimo $.getScript is a shorthand of $.ajax
[09:08:35] <joaojeronimo> ravenzz, yes, $.getScript is $.ajax with dataType: "script" and cache: false
[09:08:56] <abletony84> ravenzz: cool thanks !
[09:09:00] <ravenzz> so that is not supposed to be the problem
[09:09:03] <ravenzz> i guess
[09:09:11] <ravenzz> I mean the functions itself
[09:09:52] <joaojeronimo> ravenzz, no idea what the problem is, but I can't get .ajax saying that it couldn't fetch the script..
[09:09:52] <xec_> rabbi1: what is this code doing? looks like starts with fetching the id of current tab? or what is ui.index?
[09:09:55] <ravenzz> abletony84 just check the scrollTop value against the element position
[09:10:21] <rabbi1> xec_: it get the current tab and passes it to validateTab function
[09:10:28] <joaojeronimo> I think I'm going to make a jsfiddle, post it here, also post it on stackoverflow and hope someone will point me in the right direction..
[09:10:44] <shoky> joaojeronimo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1406537/handling-errors-in-jquery-getscript
[09:10:54] <ravenzz> joaojeronimo uhm dunno I was talking about $.getScript, beside that I don't know what you guys were talking about
[09:11:02] <shoky> (doesn't have a solution, but just shows maybe there isn't a non-hackish one right now, with jquery)
[09:11:04] <rabbi1> so, it passes all previous tabs for validation ..... in a loop
[09:11:09] <xec_> rabbi1: i see
[09:12:04] <shoky> sry didnt notice it's a pretty old SO post
[09:12:20] <shoky> but it seems to still hold.
[09:12:21] <xec_> rabbi1: so... is it working?
[09:12:36] <abletony84> ravenzz: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/vyNVN/2/ i hope, still hacking on it though
[09:12:41] <joaojeronimo> shoky: well that's not a good solution and I can't use it because I need to load scripts from cdnjs and I can't modify those files...
[09:12:52] <eregi> xec_ sent the link in the pm
[09:14:40] <shoky> joaojeronimo: yeah as i said there's no solution tehre
[09:14:45] <rabbi1> xec_: yeah working, i have no problem with that, my worry is just the one line in the previous paste i sent.. validationEngine return true or false only with the selected tab, but i need it to validate all tabs. that can be achieved by passing the tab .. so i am trying to get [div#tabid input#elementid] as a variable and validate it....
[09:15:38] <rabbi1> xec_: but not i have div#tabid in variable x and input#elementid in variable y, how can i make it div#tabid input#elementid ( combine in a variable)
[09:15:45] <joaojeronimo> shoky: yes you did... but I don't get something... why does the documentation say we can do stuff that way, but it doesn't actually work ?
[09:16:10] <rabbi1> i tried .add() but it adds but doesn't concatenate
[09:16:53] <ajpiano> rabbi1: assuming var x = $("#x");  doing x.add("#y") will not *modify* the reference at x
[09:16:55] <xec_> rabbi1: well, what sort of object does .validationEngine() work on? a collection? a container element? a single input?
[09:16:58] <shoky> joaojeronimo: i dunno
[09:17:00] <ajpiano> you have to do x = x.add("#y")
[09:17:30] <ajpiano> not sure if that is or isn't your problem but seems relevant
[09:17:37] <xec_> ajpiano: yeah hes doing something strange at http://pastebin.com/gXj5E3Lc
[09:18:05] <xec_> ajpiano: but he's got the assignment on line 8 - although it appears really hackish ;)
[09:20:32] <xec_> rabbi1: a live demo would help a lot
[09:21:21] <nevin> silverwind THANkS, did you mean like this http://jsfiddle.net/W5W6h/1/?
[09:21:36] <shoky> joaojeronimo: $.ajax error handler docs say:  Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests.
[09:22:04] <joaojeronimo> shoky: oohhhh.... wonder if there's any good reason for that...
[09:22:31] <joaojeronimo> shoky: statusCode won't work either...
[09:22:50] <shoky> joaojeronimo: and it also says:  When data is retrieved from remote servers (which is only possible using the script or jsonp data types), the error callbacks and global events will never be fired.
[09:23:13] <Wolf_22> How would you target an element by it's name attribute?
[09:23:19] <ajpiano> joaojeronimo: the good reason for it is that there isn't a clean way to do a cross browser error handler on <script> tags, which is how cross-domain script/jsonp is loaded
[09:23:55] <ravenzz> abletony84 something like this http://jsfiddle.net/vyNVN/3/
[09:24:12] <joaojeronimo> ajpiano: ok I see...
[09:24:47] <ajpiano> there is a plugin that can provide one
[09:24:55] <ajpiano> but since it requires a browser sniff it isn't in core
[09:24:59] <ravenzz> abletony84 maybe you want to add some initial logic, so it will be "sticky" if the initial scrollTop > of the element top offset
[09:25:15] <joaojeronimo> shoky, ajpiano: well, then any good ideas on how I would know if a request for a file in cdnjs.com failed or is done ?
[09:25:25] <abletony84> ravenzz: hmmm..
[09:25:51] <abletony84> bless you my brother from another mother, here i was working my way through http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9369854/make-a-div-absolutely-positioned-depending-on-scroll-height !
[09:27:14] <abletony84> ravenzz: if the initial scrollTop > of the element top offset?
[09:27:40] <ravenzz> yes
[09:28:09] <ravenzz>  say that an user oper /foo.html#whatever
[09:28:40] <ravenzz> the page will scroll to the target element
[09:29:02] <abletony84> oh yeah
[09:29:11] <abletony84> it will scroll to the target element but wont make the header sticky?
[09:29:18] <ravenzz> mhm
[09:29:25] <ravenzz> I don't know actually
[09:29:28] <abletony84> interesting..
[09:29:32] <abletony84> i got a few pages like that
[09:29:38] <ravenzz> you should try that
[09:29:51] <abletony84> help.html#whatever etc.
[09:30:02] <abletony84> most definitely will.. thanks for the heads up
[09:30:21] <ravenzz> I don't know when the scroll is triggered, maybe if you run the script on document ready it would work
[09:33:38] <glontu> hi
[09:33:46] <glontu> i am doing a post to a php script
[09:34:01] <glontu> sometimes it returns a redirect sometimes it returns some error messages
[09:34:27] <glontu> when i used a for this worked out of the box but now i can't use a form so i am using $.post()
[09:34:37] <glontu> how can i make the post behave like a normal form post ?
[09:34:48] <glontu> i mean ... not just do stuff in the background
[09:35:39] <ravenzz> be sure to send all your backend needs
[09:36:03] <ravenzz> than you would probably learn how to debug?
[09:36:19] <ravenzz> `ftj @ glontu
[09:36:24] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ glontu
[09:36:25] <bot-t> glontu, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[09:37:05] <glontu> ravenzz, the post works
[09:37:11] <glontu> the object gets created or modified
[09:37:28] <glontu> but after i submit a normal form my browser gets redirected or shown a new page
[09:37:40] <glontu> after i use post i get nothing ... it just sits there
[09:38:04] <ravenzz> that is the expected behaviour
[09:38:04] <glontu> and i was wondering if it is possible to make it do a post just like a submit
[09:38:19] <glontu> well i understand that but i would like the form behavior
[09:38:34] <ravenzz> but how? You actually don't have a target page (the form action)
[09:38:49] <glontu> where do you think i am posting to ? :)
[09:39:11] <Ianrr> I want to prevent a page from forwarding by adding javascript (I am archiving some html pages and so I can't remove the forwarding code myself)  Any ideas?
[09:39:30] <glontu> i am gathering data from multiple forms, serializing it and posting it to one of the form's action
[09:39:49] <jdeuce> glontu: i think you need a form on the page, either hidden or dynamically created that you populate with the data and call $(form).submit() on
[09:40:14] <glontu> jdeuce, that may work
[09:41:11] <jdeuce> glontu: if your data is simple enough you can just dynamically make a form with a bunch of input type=hidden elements , append it to the body, then submit it
[09:41:16] <ravenzz> so if you want to redirect to that page, it would be a simple window.top.location.href=yoururl;
[09:42:00] <rabbi1> xec_:
[09:42:07] <ravenzz> Since it will send the data again I think that submit the form would be a bad idea
[09:42:28] <ravenzz> sorry for my crappy english
[09:42:51] <some_dude> hey how do I load html file content into a jquery ui dialog?
[09:43:15] <glontu> ravenzz, i have this situation: if i submit the form to my action and the action determines it is not valid it redisplays the form with the error fields. if everything is ok then it redirects me to another ( edit ) page
[09:43:52] <glontu> if i just redirect the browser after the response to my post was sent ... i am nowhere ... the action won't know why i got there and what i want from it
[09:44:14] <jdeuce> glontu: you need to check the HTTP return code of your $.post
[09:44:38] <jdeuce> yeah sorry in this situation you don't want to make a form ( i just read the part that you wanted it to behave exactly like a form submit would )
[09:48:42] <rabbi1> xec_: you there ?
[09:49:16] <ravenzz> glontu I don't know what kind of data are you dealing with but usually you would do some simple validation only in javascript and do the serious one on the backend side. If something goes wrong you return back the form and the error messages to the user
[09:50:47] <ravenzz> Anyone with basic javascript knowledge could bypass your client side validation
[09:52:27] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: to that end, anyone with an older blackberry could do it with no knowledge :P
[09:52:52] <ravenzz> :D
[09:53:07] <Ianrr> Does anyone know if its possible to disable javascript redirection with javascript
[10:02:22] <mink> Hello. I 've got two vars.   var foo =  $(".foo");    and var bar = $(".bar");              How I can use both in jquery selector --->   logicaly looks like this->   $(foo || bar).function();
[10:10:01] <glontu> hi
[10:10:14] <glontu> is there a selector that will fetch both :input and :select elements from a form ?
[10:10:24] <phillijw> using a dialog with yes/no buttons, how can I return the result of those button clicks to the caller?
[10:12:13] <flam_> myform.find(":input, :select") i guess?
[10:13:15] <geekbuntu> glontu, :form will filter all inputs
[10:13:26] <geekbuntu> (even checkboxes)
[10:15:05] <glontu> geekbuntu, like so: ".form-secondary :form" ?
[10:15:15] <geekbuntu> glontu, yes
[10:16:02] <geekbuntu> glontu, i did it longhand without jquery but if you want the code i'll show it to you
[10:16:29] <glontu> geekbuntu, i'm affraid that's not a valid selector: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/
[10:17:35] <sia77_> Hi. I have created a jquery function that returns either true or false, and I would like to pass that value to my drupal module so it either collapse or expande a fieldset. I don't know how to pass those values. Any ideas?
[10:17:37] <geekbuntu> glontu, if you're going to use straight jquery (for logic and dom), you can try something like this $("#coc_main_form").serialize();
[10:17:45] <Guest5414> hi, how do i use .innerHTML to change content where the input type is a link rather than a button?
[10:18:21] <glontu> not gonna work geekbuntu , i need to copy all existing fields to another form and do a normal submit on that.
[10:18:45] <glontu> wonder why  they didn't make a selector that just gets all possible form elements
[10:18:48] <Brodingo> Guest5414 input type is a link?
[10:18:53] <glontu> now i have to write a 200 character selector :)
[10:18:55] <geekbuntu> glontu, this morning - i did the same thing - if you want to see the code i'll pm it to you
[10:19:07] <Guest5414> Brodingo, yes, that what i want it to be
[10:19:10] <glontu> sure, please show me geekbuntu
[10:19:56] <Brodingo> well theres no such thing as input type=link
[10:20:07] <Brodingo> but to change the value of an input use .val()
[10:20:25] <Guest5414> brodingo, yea, i know. i see a lot of examples where it works if the input type is a button, but i want to use .innerHTML when i click on an a href
[10:20:55] <geekbuntu> glontu, http://paste2.org/p/2100065
[10:21:22] <Brodingo> Guest5414 not really sure what you mean. you can use .html() or .text() to change the text of an anchor tag
[10:21:41] <glontu> thanks geekbuntu
[10:22:33] <Guest5414> Brodingo, here's the code, http://pastebin.com/9Ac9rJrG, i'm not sure why the change only blinks for a second and doesn't stay
[10:23:15] <Brodingo> so i notice you are not using jquery at all
[10:23:44] <glontu> can't i just write some selector like so: ".form-class [:input, select]" ?
[10:23:45] <Dr4g> I made a draggable and droppable elements, but they don't work on tablets, like the iPad
[10:23:57] <Dr4g> What's the adivce here to get it working so it's draggable on the tablets
[10:24:54] <geekbuntu> glontu, i tried that but i had difficulty capturing the checkboxes and selct fields
[10:25:14] <geekbuntu> glontu, just using the native dom - i caught everythign and wrote in one trap for checkboxes
[10:27:04] <some_dude> anyone knows how to get fixed rowheight in datatables?
[10:31:34] <rabbi1> ajpiano: thanks saw ur reply now, tried your x = x.add(y) still it gives me [div$tabid , input#elementid] with a comma
[10:31:54] <ajpiano> what are you expecting....
[10:32:09] <phillijw> using a dialog with yes/no buttons, how can I return the result of those button clicks to the caller?
[10:36:22] <rabbi1> ajpiano: [div$tabid  input#elementid] without a comma in between
[10:36:51] <rabbi1> ^ * [div#tabid  input#elementid]
[10:36:54] <some_dude> phillijw, who's the caller?
[10:37:25] <phillijw> some_dude: a submit button's submit event
[10:38:08] <some_dude> phillijw, so on your form when you click submit it triggers a dialog display with yes/no options rite?
[10:38:23] <some_dude> and you want to act accordingly I presume
[10:38:58] <phillijw> some_dude: yes, pretty much. There are a couple of other checks that I need to do AFTER the dialog box response comes back and I need to know the yes/no response to determine fi I should do those other things or not
[10:41:57] <some_dude> phillijw, well..you could handle yes/no button clicks. if he clicks no then you just kill the dialog and you're back at your form. iif he clicks yes then you trigger the form submit event.
[10:42:58] <phillijw> some_dude: yes, it's just poor coding because I may want to change the order of the checks in the future. Instead of being able to simply rearrange the 3 function calls, I have to rewrite each of their handlers as well
[10:43:07] <phillijw> I may end up doing it that way but it seems stupid that I have to
[10:43:37] <some_dude> phillijw, agreed. Im also interested in how to handle this :)
[10:45:29] <some_dude> phillijw, however why would you have a dialog for form validation? why not just ouput the errors and validate all fields before submiting?
[10:47:04] <Dr4g> 6:23 PM <Dr4g> I made a draggable and droppable elements, but they don't work on tablets, like the iPad
[10:47:04] <Dr4g> 6:23 PM <Dr4g> What's the adivce here to get it working so it's draggable on the tablets
[10:47:50] <phillijw> some_dude: the dialog (step 1) is not form validation. It's a question to the user that doesn't really pertain to any options in the form. Step 2 is the actual form validation
[10:51:07] <some_dude> phillijw, in state machine programming you could set fields in a global structure which different threads are reading. if ceratain data in the structure changes then the thread changes state. so presumably you could use some global struct in js as well, but Ive no idea how to go about it
[10:53:06] <some_dude> phillijw, http://www.consultek.us/2010/04/08/how-to-build-a-state-machine-with-jquery-using-custom-events/
[10:54:39] <phillijw> some_dude: that looks like overkill for this thing but interesting to know
[11:05:39] <cesarstafe> hi people, a question about a plugin that I am using together with jQuery. I am using FancyBox and I am trying to implement a function in 'onClosed' like the next ... 'onClosed': function (){$('iframe#video').hide();}
[11:05:48] <Dingo> Hiya. pardon the intrusion.. but I code mostly in ECMAscript dialects and C++ and was wondering what graphics library I should learn
[11:06:14] <cesarstafe> anybody here with experience similar trying to use FancyBox + jQuery?
[11:06:32] <cesarstafe> hi people, a question about a plugin that I am using  together with jQuery. I am using FancyBox and I am trying  to implement a function in 'onClosed' like the next ...  'onClosed': function (){$('iframe#video').hide();} anybody here with experience similar trying to use FancyBox  + jQuery?
[11:07:18] <cesarstafe> 'onClosed' is a property for FancyBox setup
[11:07:25] <cesarstafe> but this doesn't work at all
[11:08:24] <some_dude> cesarstafe, $.fn.fancybox.close(function(){close iframe}); ?
[11:08:59] <cesarstafe> some_dude: many thanks, I'll try it
[11:09:07] <some_dude> cesarstafe, npz
[11:12:24] <lamaster> $(selector).a().lot().of().methods() should be slower than $(selector).each(...foreach), right?
[11:13:33] <some_dude> lamaster, these two don't do the same thing
[11:13:58] <cesarstafe> some_dude: your code didn't work
[11:14:20] <cesarstafe> the way to use is this in FancyBox
[11:14:28] <cesarstafe> see at this pastie http://pastie.org/private/ygs9peme3s3f1whnkzbcpa
[11:14:50] <cesarstafe> but, this doesn't work
[11:15:15] <cesarstafe> so,I am wondering if there is a bug in the FancyBox onClosed option setup
[11:15:45] <cesarstafe> or is it just a mistake that I am making there.. :-|
[11:16:31] <lamaster> some_dude, i mean using chain of methods foreach of elements should be faster. cuz in first case you are iterate elements over and over on every method
[11:18:03] <lamaster> some_dude, http://jsperf.com/actionchain but my test says overwise
[11:18:45] <lamaster> *otherwise
[11:24:51] <some_dude> lamaster, ye that's interesting . by all logic usng multiple functions on each element shold be faster than selecting all elements for every function.
[11:28:18] <lamaster> some_dude, that's surprising me a lot, and i have failed with my idea of actionchain reuse.
[11:28:21] <ryanneufeld> ?101
[11:28:21] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:28:40] <ryanneufeld> was just me looking for that link
[11:28:41] <ryanneufeld> :P
[11:29:09] <some_dude> cesarstafe, do this: 'onClosed': function(){debugger;} then run it and check with firebug if it actually stops there. if it does it means that close event is  triggered and you screwed something up with your selector or function
[11:29:30] <cesarstafe> ok
[11:31:02] <some_dude> lamaster, why? when you run multple functions on on the same element you only need to search for that element once and then apply the functions. when dumb chaining you need to search for all elemtns every time then apply one function for each. the searching part is what makes it take longer
[11:36:13] <cesarstafe> some_dude: here is the result of debugger http://pastie.org/private/1hv591beqsdmpdlfv9tqoq
[11:36:53] <cesarstafe> some_dude: something is clear there.. " has no method 'close'"
[11:37:35] <cesarstafe> some_dude: could be that this means a bug of FancyBox?
[11:45:31] <gopostal> hey can someone give me a tip on reducing code see http://pastebin.com/vMsVPXQA and java.excelsiorline.com for the result which i want to achieve
[11:45:42] <gopostal> i did copy the some code over and over again
[11:45:50] <gopostal> same*

[11:51:31] <Fraz> hi
[11:51:41] <Fraz> im having a strange problem with the post method
[11:52:01] <LindsayMac> Can I disable clicks for a specific amount of time when a specific link is triggered?
[11:52:22] <Fraz> im sending a post on the click of a link and returning false. the post succeeds, but then is immediatley followed by a get
[11:52:42] <Fraz> i see this in the console of firebig, and the get just seems to keep loading forever
[11:52:48] <Fraz> any idea what would cause this?
[11:53:41] <Brodingo> LindsayMac probably with settimeout and a boolean
[11:54:33] <LindsayMac> Ill look in to that.. I'm still working on the same problem i've been working on for days
[11:54:42] <LindsayMac> i THINK this might be the most straight forward way to do it
[11:59:17] <gopostal> http://pastebin.com/vMsVPXQA can i do the same with the tabs function? also that the home screen have other buttons than on the subsites?
[12:01:13] <LindsayMac> jank busting
[12:01:52] <Brodingo> dear god
[12:02:02] <LindsayMac> ?
[12:03:30] <Brodingo> gopostal you to find a better way of linking these things together
[12:03:58] <Brodingo> gopostal use a selection to act on all of them at once then specify another action for the linked item
[12:05:42] <gopostal> Brodingo, oke any suggestion which action i should use, just started with jquery but i think that was clear :)
[12:06:01] <rickibalboa> I have an element that I've created in jQuery, using $('<div>fun stuff</div>') and I wanna get the height of it. but .height() returns 0 until it's inserted in the DOM, I need it prior to inserting in the DOM, any ideas?
[12:08:41] <LindsayMac> Man i wish I could get chrome working.. the animation tools look cool
[12:09:45] <Koolstr> I am using a jquery plugin called FancyZoom to create an image gallery that includes popup pages when the images are clicked on. However, I want to change the output/display of the popup so that the image floats to the left with the text to the right of the image, instead of having the text underneath the image as it is now. What needs to be changed in the javascript files to get this desired output? I uploaded th
[12:09:45] <Koolstr> e code to this gist https://gist.github.com/7fc57aa22d5de1efe896
[12:10:15] <Koolstr> Anything else that needs to be done I'm willing to do. Any help is appreciated.
[12:10:33] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  most times its just some CSS
[12:10:41] <gopostal> Brodingo, i understand that i will be too much to explain :), maybe there is a good reference or book i can read.
[12:10:52] <gopostal> i = it*
[12:10:53] <Koolstr> LindsayMac: Can you check?
[12:10:58] <Brodingo> ?jqf
[12:10:58] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[12:10:59] <Koolstr> I can't seem to figure out how
[12:11:08] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  in a little.. can't at the moment.
[12:11:17] <Koolstr> That's fine
[12:15:14] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  do you have firebug? You can probably look at what you need to change that way while i'm busy
[12:16:04] <Reedling78> anyone know of a good way to render a PDF in jquery mobile?
[12:18:37] <Koolstr> No I use Chrome primarily. I'll download it though and ty
[12:18:39] <Koolstr> *try
[12:19:09] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  theres plugins for chrome too.. just inspect the element.
[12:19:23] <Haprog> don't even need plugins. just hit F12 on chrome to open dev tools
[12:19:24] <LindsayMac> i dont know specifically for chrome because i cant seem to get it installed.. but yea
[12:19:30] <LindsayMac> or that
[12:19:37] <Koolstr> so why do i need firebug?
[12:19:44] <Brodingo> you dont
[12:19:51] <Koolstr> and is the default element inspector in chrome good enough?
[12:19:54] <LindsayMac> you dont.. i just mentioned it because its what i use right now..
[12:20:09] <LindsayMac> you can use anything that will let you look at your html output / css styles and edit them on the page
[12:20:53] <Koolstr> man this is confusing...
[12:21:19] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  just look at the html/css and try and make changes...
[12:21:40] <Koolstr> I'm trying to figure it out and i have no diea
[12:22:03] <Koolstr> *idea. The elements section in chrome lists stuff but I can't see what has an effet on the embedded popup bit
[12:22:19] <lamaster> Koolstr, chrome's devtools are awesome, no doubt
[12:27:09] <Koolstr> I think I found what needs to be changed. LindsayMac, are any changes made i nthe dev tools permanent aka are they saved to the file? Or do I now have to look in my html/css files for that code and change it manually?
[12:27:30] <Koolstr> Also, how do I reference the width to be the length of the screen?
[12:29:58] <LindsayMac> Koolstr:  no.. they are not They are for testing only and then you apply to your css file
[12:30:20] <LindsayMac> width:100%; could be used, but it depends on your structure Koolstr
[12:30:25] <shoky> well. newer chrome devtools does allow you to save as you're editing in the devtools
[12:30:28] <shoky> ;P
[12:30:51] <LindsayMac> really?? interesting
[12:30:58] <LindsayMac> gahhh i gotta get Chrome!
[12:31:11] <LindsayMac> shoky:  watching the google chromium JANK BUSTERS video now
[12:31:14] <LindsayMac> but i cant use it!
[12:31:21] <Koolstr> Alright. Yeah, that's not working, because there's most likely an attribute above it that limits the window size. I'm having trouble properly sizing the windows. T_T When you get the chance, please take a look at it.
[12:31:24] <shoky> what's the problem with installing chrome?
[12:31:50] <gnarf> ?g paul irish chrome developer tools @LindsayMac
[12:31:52] <bot-t> LindsayMac, A Re-introduction to the Chrome Developer Tools « Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[12:31:58] <LindsayMac> shoky:  apparently it has issues with the new mac os, but basically every page i go to, I get the Aw,Snap
[12:32:09] <LindsayMac> and I already tried the "fixes" listed on their site.
[12:32:23] <Brodingo> that stinks
[12:32:34] <gnarf> LindsayMac: stable / beta / or developer channel?
[12:32:41] <shoky> yea, i'd work more on getting that fixed
[12:32:48] <LindsayMac> stable
[12:32:49] <gnarf> cuz Chrome 21 stable works fine on my mac
[12:33:01] <gnarf> any extensions running?
[12:33:04] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  it seems as though its an intermittent issue
[12:33:06] <LindsayMac> No extensions..
[12:33:34] <gnarf> LindsayMac: sucks - better warn paul_irish! :)
[12:33:35] <LindsayMac> actually, i think i installed one based on a forum post on how to fix it
[12:34:14] <gnarf> check canary
[12:34:20] <gnarf> it might actually work better
[12:34:26] <gnarf> but livin on the edge is dangerous :)
[12:34:45] <LindsayMac> well.. i posted on a thread.. i'm not the ONLY one with the issue, but its not an issue for everyone. I even completely uninstalled with CC cleaner and reinstalled
[12:35:24] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  i was hoping to eventually get the stable working
[12:36:34] <LindsayMac> I even get the Aw,Snap on the extensions page
[12:37:59] <shoky> try installing canary anyway, see if that works
[12:38:13] <Brodingo> LindsayMac do this http://blog.printfection.com/files/2012/06/ron-swanson-computer.gif

[12:43:24] <Brodingo> ?p @ StingRay`
[12:43:24] <bot-t> StingRay`, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:43:26] <StingRay`> Brodingo i am try to create Tabbed Interface i am found jquery tutorials on tutsplus.com
[12:43:51] <StingRay`> Brodingo http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/create-a-tabbed-interface-using-jquery/
[12:44:00] <StingRay`> Brodingo when i am try to add this script in you my website it's not working. firebug console give me this error message TypeError: $("#tabvanilla > ul").tabs is not a function
[12:44:11] <StingRay`> Brodingo this is my website page where i want add tabbed interface https://teslasolution.com/splash.php
[12:44:24] <LindsayMac> StingRay`:  sounds like you didn't include the script needed
[12:44:45] <Brodingo> tabs is a part of jquery UI
[12:45:08] <Brodingo> macedonian? is that right?
[12:45:18] <StingRay`> Brodingo i am add ui script i am test this my test url is https://teslasolution.com/tabview/
[12:45:40] <StingRay`> yes macedonian
[12:45:54] <Brodingo> i had no idea that was still a thing
[12:46:23] <z0ned> anyone work with twitter bootstrap's collapsible? for some reason after creating a collapsible accordion, i can't figure out what i need to do to be able to expand/collapse it. $("#accordionId").toggle, .collapse('show'), .collapse('hide') ... nothing works
[12:46:35] <z0ned> not sure what im missing
[12:47:27] <Brodingo> is there a bootstrap channel?
[12:47:57] <z0ned> 3 people in #bootstrap :/
[12:48:06] <StingRay`> Brodingo now what i can do ?
[12:48:35] <StingRay`> z0ned yes you miss my problem
[12:49:16] <Brodingo> StingRay` i think you call .tabs() on the container not the ul
[12:50:21] <Koolstr> LindsayMac: I tried, and I can't figure it out. I found what div is influencing the width, but I have no iea how or where its numbers are being generated from inside the jquery plugin. It's dynamic at this point, changing the width depending on the image width. I want it to be a fixed size at the length of the screen (with a bit of a margin of course) no matter the image size. I need you to look at the pluign and
[12:50:21] <Koolstr> see how to change how the width is generated, because I don't know how.
[12:51:00] <ezio> Koolstr, what plugin?
[12:55:07] <abletony84> ravenzz: any idea why your piece of code conflicts with this other "sliding down forms" piece of code? http://pastie.org/4444135
[12:55:16] <z0ned> can anyone tell me what i need to do in order to be able to programmatically expand/collapse the #Custom-accordion in this http://jsfiddle.net/RXdaD/ because i've read all the docs and just can't figure it out
[12:56:45] <Koolstr> ezio: FancyZoom. I uploaded the code here: https://gist.github.com/7fc57aa22d5de1efe896 I am currently using the minified version
[13:00:31] <niix> is there a way to format the output of FullCalendar event start and end times so they are not formatted like "2012-08-08T12:15:00.000Z"
[13:00:43] <katherinem13> I have to DataTables with the same columns, side by side. Can I link them, so that performing an action on one of them (e.g., sorting, going to next/prev page) performs the same action on the other?
[13:00:54] <katherinem13> s/to/two/
[13:11:03] <rickibalboa> Anyone have any idea how I can loop first level elements between two jquery objects, like looping between $('div.some-div') and stopping at $('div.some-div-20-divs-later')
[13:11:34] <dogarrhea2_> there are more managers here than there are programmers. i wonder
[13:12:07] <shoky> ?nextUntil @ rickibalboa
[13:12:08] <bot-t> rickibalboa, .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[13:12:23] <dogarrhea2_> what are other ways of doing cross browser hacking besides jsonp?
[13:12:48] <dogarrhea2_> trying to put ads up somewhere
[13:12:50] <rickibalboa> hmm cool thanks
[13:15:52] <rickibalboa> shoky, is there any way I can execute a callback on each iteration? Rather than using something like .css()
[13:20:40] <initself> how do i select <select name="mbb_main_flag.x"> where x is incremental?
[13:20:54] <shoky> ?each @ rickibalboa
[13:20:56] <bot-t> rickibalboa, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:20:58] <ak> rickibalboa: .nextUntil().each() should work
[13:21:20] <rickibalboa> Ah okay thanks.
[13:21:22] <jdeuce> initself: $("select[name^='mbb_main_flag.']") might be the simplest way
[13:22:04] <initself> jdeuce++
[13:22:43] <xckpd7> alright, this is driving me crazy: how come when I inspect this text area, there is no text inside of it, when there is clearly text inside of it on the page?
[13:23:17] <shoky> xckpd7: using .val() ?
[13:23:18] <tehOPEologist> exit
[13:23:34] <shoky> oh when you inspect with the devtools?
[13:23:44] <tehOPEologist> did this channel go anonymous?
[13:23:55] <shoky> xckpd7: there are a lot of things that dont show up in the inspection view
[13:23:56] <tehOPEologist> i can't see anyone in the list >_<
[13:24:42] <tehOPEologist> there we go
[13:24:47] <tehOPEologist> a little lag, i guess, lol
[13:24:54] <tehOPEologist> yo shoky!  how've you been?
[13:25:02] <jdeuce> xckpd7: in chrome i can select the text area then go under the 'properties' heading on the right, open HTMLTextAreaElement and see value
[13:25:31] <xckpd7> shoky: jdeuce: thanks
[13:26:15] <shoky> hi tehOPEologist. i'm oks, been worse ;P
[13:26:50] <tehOPEologist> how would one go about editing an xml file from an onClick tag in an img tag?
[13:26:52] <tehOPEologist> like
[13:27:27] <tehOPEologist> i want to add a tag in a specific xml file on the client's computer who clicks on the image
[13:27:38] <shoky> huh
[13:27:51] <tehOPEologist> it's not for malicious purposes, i'm trying to streamline custom smileys for my employees and i at work for pidgin
[13:28:06] <shoky> huh ;)
[13:28:08] <gnarf> I would never do anything in an "onclick"
[13:28:20] <tehOPEologist> and pidgin connects the image and the custom phrase with an xml file
[13:28:29] <tehOPEologist> well, that was just an example to get you to understand what i'm trying to do
[13:28:43] <tehOPEologist> i could easily make a jquery file that uses .click
[13:28:44] <gnarf> i would also have no idea wth you're talking about - you can't "edit files"
[13:28:51] <gnarf> in the browser
[13:28:52] <tehOPEologist> but just giving you the idea of what i'm trying to accomplish
[13:29:12] <gnarf> ever
[13:29:16] <tehOPEologist> lol
[13:29:25] <tehOPEologist> i get it, don't use onClick xD
[13:29:32] <gnarf> security consultants would scream
[13:29:34] <tehOPEologist> but, how would one go about editing the .xml?
[13:29:39] <gnarf> you can't
[13:29:43] <tehOPEologist> there's just no way?
[13:29:47] <gnarf> of course not
[13:30:00] <tehOPEologist> what about having people who want to do it add a link to another xml file in the main one?
[13:30:12] <tehOPEologist> like what you can do in .css files to reference another .css file
[13:30:42] <tehOPEologist> and then i could just have them download the new .xml file, and tell them to add <thisxmlreference> tag
[13:30:43] <gnarf> think for a minute about what you're asking... XML doesn't have anything built in for includes
[13:30:46] <tehOPEologist> to the original .xml file
[13:31:03] <tehOPEologist> argh >_<  mkay, i'm not super familiar with .xml
[13:31:16] <tehOPEologist> so i wasn't sure if the language supported something like that
[13:31:27] <CodesStuff> holy shit your name color is bright
[13:31:31] <gnarf> seems you aren't very familiar with application development either...
[13:31:33] <CodesStuff> damnit, pidgin.
[13:31:51] <tehOPEologist> app dev, no
[13:32:00] <tehOPEologist> this is a small side project i want to do while i'm not super busy at work
[13:32:05] <gnarf> like - if you want to append stuff to an xml file, do it from the application - pidgin isn't running in a browser
[13:32:10] <tehOPEologist> cuz we all use custom smileys in IMs to one another
[13:32:25] <CodesStuff> Well, namespaces could come into play..
[13:32:27] <tehOPEologist> but there's no repository of all of them for people to add to their list of custom ones
[13:32:34] <CodesStuff> but that's a conversation I'm not having
[13:33:08] <tehOPEologist> i'm just trying to see if i can push a new xml line to the file
[13:33:15] <tehOPEologist> but if not, gotta figure out another way to do it >_<
[13:34:00] <gnarf> tehOPEologist: do it from inside the app itself, that actually has access to edit files, especially its own configuration files...
[13:34:11] <gnarf> but whatever it is, it has nothing to do with #jquery ;)(
[13:34:34] <tehOPEologist> hm..  someone here at work suggested running a .bat
[13:34:57] <tehOPEologist> well, i thought it had a little to do with #jquery, cuz it's a website that's trying to do all of this
[13:35:06] <gnarf> *facepalm*
[13:35:12] <jdeuce> seconded
[13:35:16] <tehOPEologist> meowmeow.
[13:35:18] <shoky> sold
[13:35:19] <troll-boy> thirded
[13:35:25] <tehOPEologist> i'm just looking for thoughts and suggestions.  no need for trolling.
[13:35:39] <shoky> you got them
[13:35:41] <tehOPEologist> i'm not claiming to know how to do it, which is why i'm asking for advice
[13:36:14] <troll-boy> Our advice is; you're way over your head.  But scroll up and re-read.
[13:36:29] <tehOPEologist> i'm sure i am, but it seems like a fun project to learn from :)
[13:36:44] <gnarf> tehOPEologist: take some programming classes, and whoever said something about a .bat - I hope they aren't a developer either
[13:36:49] <troll-boy> that's kinda like learning first aid by doing elective open heart surgery on your neighbor.
[13:36:52] <tehOPEologist> and yeah, i guess i'll look up on how pidgin writes the .xml and see if there's some way to do it from the site..
[13:36:53] <tehOPEologist> 8shrug*
[13:37:00] <jdeuce> tehOPEologist: your friend at work was right that you need to use an external process such as a .bat or .exe to make it happen. the only way to connect that to the webpage is by creating a link to download that file
[13:37:11] <tehOPEologist> yeah
[13:37:13] <tehOPEologist> that's what i thought
[13:37:20] <tehOPEologist> so maybe something like:
[13:37:26] <tehOPEologist> you select all the smileys you want
[13:37:34] <tehOPEologist> and then at the end have a "checkout" or something like that
[13:37:51] <tehOPEologist> where you get a custom .bat file to have you run to add those files to the smiley mgre
[13:37:53] <tehOPEologist> *mgr
[13:37:57] <tehOPEologist> that's the only thing i could think of
[13:38:15] <tehOPEologist> just didn't know if there was an easier way to do it, like just clicking on the image on the site and it adding to the smiley mgr
[13:38:28] <gnarf> tehOPEologist: if pidgin supports external url formats, maybe
[13:38:53] <tehOPEologist> could you elaborate on what you mean by that please?
[13:38:59] <tehOPEologist> not sure i understand
[13:40:03] <tehOPEologist> wait
[13:40:08] <tehOPEologist> i think i know what you mean
[13:40:10] <gnarf> like spotify:track:1IUlZ9xe4JQA8GEBX4nRKG
[13:40:11] <b-ot> â™© Ghostwriter Remix by RJD2 â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–® spotify:track:1IUlZ9xe4JQA8GEBX4nRKG
[13:40:15] <tehOPEologist> yeah
[13:40:34] <tehOPEologist> so basically instead of downlading and running a .bar
[13:40:35] <tehOPEologist> *.bat
[13:40:53] <tehOPEologist> having an external url connect directly to pidgin and give it commands to add the xml line?
[13:41:03] <tehOPEologist> just trying to think this out and how it would work..
[13:41:15] <gnarf> thats about it, but seriously - this is so not jquery
[13:41:30] <tehOPEologist> lol understandable.
[13:41:38] <tehOPEologist> just thought i'd get some collective smart answers
[13:41:41] <tehOPEologist> thanks all <3
[13:42:03] <tehOPEologist> and shoky <3
[13:42:04] <tehOPEologist> hehe :3
[14:28:40] <dogarrhea2> how does jquery play with xforms?
[14:29:23] <dogarrhea2> specifically, how would it play with elements that look like this: <input id="xf-4$xforms-input-1" type="text" name="xf-4$xforms-input-1" value="" class="xforms-input-input">
[14:29:45] <dogarrhea2> or like this: <input type="text" name="$client-state" value="" class="xforms-initially-hidden">
[14:29:50] <gnarf> dogarrhea2: you might have to escape the $ in the ID - it is after all not valid html ID
[14:29:58] <gnarf> ?valid id
[14:29:58] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[14:30:07] <dogarrhea2> so orbeon xforms are invalid?
[14:30:12] <dogarrhea2> it's using xhtml
[14:30:16] <gnarf> if there is a $ in an ID - yup
[14:30:44] <dogarrhea2> hrm it says it's following some xforms specification by the w3c
[14:30:47] <dogarrhea2> i am confused
[14:31:15] <gnarf> maybe they altered it at some point
[14:31:23] <gnarf> but $ hasn't been legal in html IDs in forever
[14:31:38] <dogarrhea2> so orbeon xforms are useless hrm?
[14:31:48] <gnarf> then again - noone has ever really validated html ids
[14:31:58] <gnarf> people end up with dupes all the time
[14:32:38] <gnarf> [] arent legal either, but people use em
[14:32:45] <silverwind> $ might be legal in XML..
[14:32:49] <silverwind> HTML isn't XML
[14:33:10] <gnarf> if $ is legal in XML, its legal in XHTML most likely
[14:33:20] <gnarf> but seriously, xhtml sucks :)
[14:33:29] <silverwind> I totally agree :D
[14:33:35] <rmill> gnarf: they changed the ID things
[14:34:24] <rmill> in HTML5 land <p id="â™¥"> is actually valid.
[14:35:01] <gnarf> rmill: good to know - dangerous tho :)
[14:35:16] <gnarf> i suppose it brings up all sorts of fun for hash links :)
[14:35:17] <rmill> yep, think about the implications in css/js
[14:36:04] <CodesStuff> god damnit. QT is really nice, but setting up the enviornment is a pain in the dick
[14:36:11] <CodesStuff> aaaaaaand wrong channel.
[14:36:42] <rmill> gnarf: HTML5: <p class=":`("> CSS: .\3A \`\( { }
[14:37:27] <CodesStuff> wat
[14:37:28] <b-ot> I am wonder about the procedure, how to do, if I have checked checkbox, so how to disable to user unchecked this checkbox..
[14:37:50] <CodesStuff> wat *2

[14:48:50] <tw2113> anyone know where jQuery stickers could be acquired?
[14:48:56] <tw2113> besides at some major event
[14:49:20] <CodesStuff> tw2113: http://www.devswag.com/products/jquery-sticker
[14:49:27] <tw2113> thanks
[14:49:34] <CodesStuff> I just googled it lol
[14:49:47] <tw2113> there was my issue, i duckduckgo'd it
[14:49:51] <tw2113> didn't see the same result
[14:49:57] <CodesStuff> I'm sure gnarf knows better spots - he went to the Boston event iirc
[14:50:21] <gnarf> devswag's the official distributor for em
[14:50:26] <CodesStuff> http://www.devswag.com/collections/jquery
[14:50:36] <CodesStuff> Well there we go. GNARF HAS SPOKEN.
[14:51:36] <tw2113> the gnarf speaks
[14:52:06] <CodesStuff> he hath speaketh
[15:02:55] <dogarrhea2> omg. xforms is so useless and complex
[15:03:16] <dogarrhea2> why the f**** woudl my company adopt this for anything
[15:04:06] <dogarrhea2> they should bring back vertical impalement as a punishment

[15:07:42] <jita> how can i add handler to enter key pressed in textarea ?
[15:08:05] <ryanneufeld> jita: keyup or keydown
[15:08:15] <ryanneufeld> depending on how you want t to respond see ?on
[15:08:16] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:08:16] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised â€œon()â€.

[15:18:10] <jita> message = $("<a href='#' class='cam-request'>Accept cam request</a>");
[15:18:19] <jita> how can i display the markup afterwards?
[15:18:32] <jita> message.html() only gives text ' Accept cam request'
[15:18:41] <jita> while i want "<a href='#' class='cam-request'>Accept cam request</a>"
[15:18:53] <gnarf> jita: .html() returns "inner" html
[15:19:08] <gnarf> .clone().appendTo("<div>").parent().html() will get it
[15:19:09] <b-ot> gnarf, definitely being used as one ;)
[15:19:24] <Koolstr> I am using a jquery plugin called FancyZoom to create an image gallery that includes popup pages when the images are clicked on. However, I want to change the output/display of the popup so that the image floats to the left with the text to the right of the image, instead of having the text underneath the image as it is now. What needs to be changed in the javascript files to get this desired output?
[15:19:24] <Koolstr> I uploaded the code to this gist https://gist.github.com/7fc57aa22d5de1efe896
[15:19:45] * geekbuntu gnarf... a clone?
[15:20:11] <dogarrhea2> cool. let's introduce validation rules logic to the front end via xforms
[15:20:31] <dogarrhea2> god why do people still use all this xml enterprise bullshit
[15:20:34] <jita> gnarf, thanks
[15:20:35] <gnarf> geekbuntu: yeah - because you don't want to put the original inside a detached div - that would remove it from the dom
[15:42:42] <kkuno> hi
[15:42:54] <kkuno> I'm trying to select the children of an element
[15:43:01] <kkuno> like $('body').children()
[15:43:11] <kkuno> and I want to filter them somehow
[15:43:28] <kkuno> if I use find(), it searches through all the tree
[15:43:36] <gnarf> .children takes a selector too
[15:43:40] <kkuno> I want to filter only the direct children
[15:43:46] <gnarf> you can also .filter
[15:43:46] <kkuno> mmh
[15:43:48] <gnarf> ?children
[15:43:49] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[15:43:49] <gnarf> ?filter
[15:43:50] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:43:57] <kkuno> mmh ok
[15:43:58] <kkuno> thanks

[16:28:18] <austinallen> yay, 1.8 is released :D
[16:30:19] <tds5016> hi. I was wondering if someone could tell me how to set the helper's class/dimensions in sortable?
[16:30:44] <tds5016> start: function (event, ui) {  ui.helper.css({                     "width": "50px",                     "height":"20px"                 });
[16:30:48] <tds5016> that does not appear to work.
[16:30:57] <tds5016> sorry for the whitespacing. I didn't mean to ahve any :-X
[16:31:47] <tds5016> it'll work unless I set the helper to be 'clone'
[16:31:55] <tds5016> which, comes with it's own problems.
[16:32:00] <tds5016> and I'd rather have hte original than a clone.
[16:46:56] <mekwall> modular jquery makes me hard

[17:09:30] <CodesStuff> Sorry. It needed to be done.

[17:09:45] <lindsayo> I flashed to LindsayMac and I arm in arm spinning through a fountain in a park.
[17:09:50] <lindsayo> I don't even know what she looks like.
[17:09:54] <LindsayMac> LOL
[17:10:02] <LindsayMac> I look like hotnes

[17:10:47] <lindsayo> In the UK, it's less predictable.
[17:11:09] <LindsayMac> holy heck did you just ask A/S/L
[17:11:20] <LindsayMac> damn that brings me back to the old aol chat room dayz
[17:11:36] <CodesStuff> I used to think "a/s/l" meant, "Asshole".

[17:12:33] <tds5016> can someone help me figure out how to make a sortable draggable?
[17:12:42] <jaket> did you just make that up CodesStuff?
[17:12:50] <jaket> because it's one of the funniest things i've ever heard.
[17:12:53] <tds5016> and to change its class/css while appending to body?
[17:13:13] <LindsayMac> tds5016:  theres some demos on the jquery UI site
[17:13:22] <CodesStuff> Jaket: Alas, I'm not that original. I saw it on /b/ years ago.
[17:13:31] <tds5016> LindsayMac: can you link me? the demo doesn't show that....
[17:13:40] <tds5016> when I do sortable
[17:13:47] <tds5016> and then I do appendTo....
[17:13:52] <CodesStuff> ">mfw I realized 'a/s/l' didn't mean 'asshole'."
[17:14:09] <tds5016> it actually causes it to loose all styling.
[17:15:31] <LindsayMac> tds5016:  http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable
[17:15:46] <LindsayMac> its under the tab that says DRAGGABLE SORTABLE tds5016
[17:17:02] <tds5016> LindsayMac: I'm not trying to connect a draggable to a sortable.
[17:17:10] <tds5016> I'm trying to connect a sortable to a draggable...
[17:17:14] <CodesStuff> THAT'S IT
[17:17:15] <tds5016> which isn't what this does :-/.
[17:17:18] <CodesStuff> I'M GOING TO GO PLAY LEAGUE
[17:17:21] <LindsayMac> what do you mean connect to?
[17:17:50] <tds5016> LindsayMac: what I'm trying to do is to get an item to go away when I drag it out of the sortable list.
[17:20:11] <systemfault> Cool, 1.8 is out :D
[17:20:34] <tds5016> any ideas, or am I a complete moron?
[17:20:35] <LindsayMac> ermergerd
[17:20:43] <tds5016> I would just like to get this damned thing to take my styling.
[17:20:43] <tds5016> haha.
[17:20:47] <LindsayMac> tds5016: you're gonna have to show an example orsomething
[17:20:56] <tds5016> I've got it connected to body....
[17:21:00] <tds5016> and dropping works....
[17:21:24] <tds5016> but I need to get the list item I'm sorting and appended to body to take the styling I want, and not the styling it's giving me.
[17:21:35] <LindsayMac> sorry guize.. gotta restart.
[17:30:47] <clone1018> hello there, I'm trying to set the contents of a div with escaped HTML, but this is happening instead: http://jsfiddle.net/clone1018/t4V9t/1/
[17:30:57] <clone1018> Does anyone have any ideas?
[17:32:59] <klocatelli> the div *is* getting set with the escaped html
[17:33:21] <clone1018> Then how do i inject it into the dom?
[17:34:36] <E1ven> I have some code that works under 1.7.2, but breaks under 1.8 - It doesn't use the methods mentioned in the readme. Is this an appropriate place to ask for help in finding out why?
[17:34:40] <klocatelli> Oh you're trying to set the contents with the *unescaped* html?
[17:34:57] <klocatelli> well for a start, might want to make sure it's being properly escaped
[17:35:09] <tds5016> on sortable...
[17:35:18] <tds5016> is there a way to get helper to be fired AFTER start?
[17:35:22] <clone1018> klocatelli: I'm trying to set the contents of #stuff to be a header 2 element that says Hello, World!
[17:35:41] <klocatelli> yes. but what you have set to stuff ins't the escaped version of <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
[17:35:45] <xboi209> how do i add div tags before and after certain text?
[17:36:03] <clone1018> klocatelli: but it is something that can be unescaped()'d
[17:36:26] <klocatelli> no, it's not.
[17:36:30] <tds5016> Sorry to keep asking; but this is really frustrating trying to get something so simple to work.
[17:36:31] <tds5016> haha.
[17:36:42] <clone1018> klocatelli: it is... right there...
[17:36:52] <klocatelli> Nope. That's why it's not working
[17:36:54] <klocatelli> unescape("&lt;h2&gt;Hello, World!&lt;\/h2&gt;"); => "&lt;h2&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h2&gt;"
[17:37:13] <klocatelli> escape("<h2>Hello, World!</h2>"); => "%3Ch2%3EHello%2C%20World%21%3C/h2%3E"
[17:42:36] <klocatelli> clone1018, http://jsfiddle.net/t4V9t/2/ ;)
[17:45:43] <tds5016> in sortable....
[17:45:47] <tds5016> in helper...
[17:45:54] <tds5016> is there any way to get the index of the selected item?
[17:46:10] <tds5016> helper: function(event, ui){console.log(ui.item.index());}
[17:46:15] <tds5016> that appears not to work :-/.
[17:48:01] <Stephen> tds: try using this.item
[17:48:49] <tds5016> $(this).item?
[17:48:54] <tds5016> or?
[17:49:51] <Stephen> Dunno...
[17:50:19] <Stephen> I suggest debugging and finding out what the value of this is at that point
[18:03:56] <shoky> E1ven: yes
[18:04:22] <E1ven> Thanks. Workign to reproduce in minimum test case.
[18:06:49] <shoky> tds5016: the second argument to helper _is_ the item
[18:06:59] <shoky> tds5016: just like the docs say
[18:07:06] <shoky> tds5016: so, ui.index()
[18:07:19] <_ramok> hi
[18:07:27] <tds5016> oh, so when I'm in the helper if I do ui.index() it'll give me the proper index.
[18:07:40] <shoky> yuh
[18:07:46] <_ramok> is it easy to build a search like on the google page? i mean to start typing in the searchfield and below the whole page refreshs with the results?
[18:08:05] <tds5016> shoky: I still don't think that'll do exactly what I'm looking for.
[18:08:29] <nero> does anyone know of a jquery module/code that will change an element's class based on where the page is scrolled to?
[18:09:02] <tds5016> is there a way to get helper to take a given styling without a specialized helper option?
[18:09:15] <nero> (i.e.- I have a one-page navigation site, and have all of my smooths scrolling, etc.. but am having trouble changing the class of my nav button to "active" depending on where I am scrolled to)
[18:10:53] <shoky> tds5016: yes..
[18:11:07] <tds5016> how would I do that?
[18:11:53] <shoky> tds5016: from the docs: The supplied function receives the event and the element being sorted, and should return a DOMElement to be used as a custom proxy helper
[18:13:14] <tds5016> shoky: yeah, I meant how can I use the original element, append it to the body, then give it a styling?
[18:13:54] <shoky> not sure what you mean..
[18:14:20] <LindsayMac> well that sucked!
[18:14:41] <tds5016> shoky: so.... is there a way to give the default (original div) a styling the the helper option?
[18:14:58] <shoky> tds5016: you want a helper or not?
[18:15:12] <tds5016> shoky: I want to style the default helper.
[18:15:17] <tds5016> I don't want to clone.
[18:15:29] <shoky> what do you mean by default helper?
[18:15:49] <tds5016> helper: 'original'
[18:15:58] <shoky> ok
[18:16:36] <tds5016> sorry for such a stupid question. I've been struggling with this, and I've no clue how to figure it out :-/.
[18:17:47] <shoky> um
[18:18:10] <shoky> so, use the start event, and do whatever you want to ui.item
[18:18:21] <shoky> same with stop..
[18:19:29] <tds5016> shoky: soo... apparently that won't work :-/. it basically starts with a huge image...
[18:19:35] <tds5016> and then resizes the image...
[18:19:37] <shoky> sure it works
[18:19:49] <tds5016> but doesn't move my mouse to where the helper is.
[18:20:01] <tds5016> so I'm dragging something that's a good 800 pixels away from my mouse.
[18:20:49] <shoky> i dont know what you're talking about
[18:20:59] <shoky> you know why? cause you have no test case
[18:21:02] <tds5016> actually....
[18:21:08] <tds5016> nevermind, that isn't what causes the problem.
[18:21:10] <shoky> tds5016: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/18/
[18:21:27] <tds5016> when you use original.... appendTo: 'body' doesn't seem to append the original to the boxy.
[18:21:29] <tds5016> body*
[18:21:30] <shoky> actually there's a better way to do that
[18:21:43] <shoky> with pure css
[18:23:17] <shoky> ?demo @ tds5016
[18:23:18] <bot-t> tds5016, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:23:46] <shoky> (if you wanted to know the better way to do it:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/19/ )
[18:33:15] <E1ven> New question- I can use .on() to trigger events on elements which haven't been created yet. If I create a div, this will let it respond to click events.. Is there any way to trigger a function when these elements come into being? jQuery(document).on('load','.example', foo(event)) doesn't seem to work.
[18:33:46] <tds5016> shoky: apparently when I use original....
[18:33:54] <E1ven> Essentially, a .each() that works into the future.
[18:34:00] <tds5016> and I try to appendTo:'body'... it doesn't actaully append to body...
[18:34:09] <tds5016> it stays with the original div it was in.
[18:36:28] <tds5016> okay....
[18:36:39] <tds5016> better question... lemme flip this question on it's head... when I use clone....
[18:37:00] <tds5016> I actually get a different image than the one that is in the object I'm pointing to.
[18:37:20] <shoky> E1ven: there isn't currently a cross-browser clean way of doing that
[18:37:40] <tds5016> any idea how I can get clone to use the actual image that is already loaded rather than trying to reload the image form the server (which has changed since having created this object)
[18:38:45] <shoky> tds5016: you're getting another hit on your server?
[18:39:08] <tds5016> yes.
[18:39:26] <tds5016> technically.... I'm actually creating another object...
[18:39:36] <shoky> what?
[18:39:54] <tds5016> nevermind, it's too hard to explain. I'm going to go try to figure this out before I waste any more of your time.
[18:40:00] <shoky> k
[18:40:02] <tds5016> Thanks for the help thouhg! It really is seriously appreciated.
[18:40:18] <shoky> np
[18:42:26] <azbyin> hi all..
[18:43:07] <E1ven> Ah. It looks like what I need is 'DOMNodeInserted', but runs very very badly ;(
[18:43:10] <E1ven> Alas. Ah-well.
[18:43:59] <shoky> those are deprecated anyway
[18:44:35] <gnarf> E1ven: if you are appending the elements
[18:44:40] <gnarf> you can do something like this
[18:44:44] <gnarf> ?newContent
[18:44:44] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[18:45:49] <azbyin> shoky, is it possible for you to check something? trigerring a .click() on a span works in ff, but doesn;t work in chrome (or other webkit browsers)
[18:46:06] <shoky> azbyin: it would be possible for me if you provided a jsfiddle
[18:46:09] <azbyin> i'll give you the url of the live site, if you are ok
[18:46:21] <shoky> i am ok
[18:46:25] <azbyin> thanks
[18:46:28] <shoky> :D
[18:48:54] <E1ven> Aha! Brilliant! I can do it via an animation event!
[18:48:54] <E1ven> http://www.backalleycoder.com/2012/04/25/i-want-a-damnodeinserted/
[18:49:19] <E1ven> That seems to work.
[18:49:24] * E1ven is happy now.
[18:50:42] <tds5016> helper: 'original',  appendTo: 'body'
[18:50:54] <tds5016> okay, why will this not append to body?
[18:51:15] <tds5016> if the element is appended elsehwere, will that cause it to not append to the body?
[18:58:20] <tds5016> okay....
[18:58:32] <tds5016> shoky: I give up.... can you help me with this, I'll explain what is going on....
[18:59:36] <tds5016> so I have a group of objects that have images.... they all point to the same place on the server, because that one image on the server is the one that keeps getting updated.
[19:00:50] <tds5016> when I do clone on an object's image, apparently jQuery grabs the newest version of that image... that being the case, the image that I want to seee.... apparently is not the one I get :-/.
[19:02:58] <shoky> why do you want it appended to body?
[19:07:12] <markoheijnen> Hey guys, Anyone knows a code example to get a variable set by a jquery plugin each method?
[19:07:51] <Stephen> Each method?
[19:07:57] <Stephen> You mean each time it's changed?
[19:08:37] <markoheijnen> I mean this.each in $.fn.myPlugin = function() {}
[19:13:23] <shoky> "get a variable" ?
[19:13:31] <shoky> what variable
[19:14:15] <markoheijnen> shoky: The variable will be a youtube movie. loading in the this.each
[19:14:29] <shoky> ?p @ markoheijnen
[19:14:30] <bot-t> markoheijnen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:15:49] <markoheijnen> shoky: This is all the code: http://jsfiddle.net/h82aP/1/
[19:16:19] <markoheijnen> $.fn.deck has the player var and I need it in $.fn.mixer for crossFade
[19:16:58] <shoky> markoheijnen: i think you want to use .data(...)
[19:18:37] <tds5016> how do I checkw hat classes an element has?
[19:18:55] <markoheijnen> shoky: Will play with that
[19:21:53] <shoky> tds5016: .prop('className') gets you a string
[19:22:33] <tds5016> sounds good!
[19:22:40] <tds5016> in droppable.... how would I see what item is being dropped?
[19:22:50] <shoky> read the docs?
[19:22:52] <tds5016> sorry... I know this is a stupid question, and I'm offended I have to ask it too :-/.
[19:22:56] <shoky> lol
[19:23:02] <shoky> then don't ask it.
[19:23:49] <tds5016> shoky: yeah, kinda regretted it as it was happening.
[19:45:36] <ibodi> howto get this work thanks: $('.preLoad').html($('#'+this.id+'Txt').html());
[19:46:03] <ibodi> nowhere to input function(){} ?
[19:50:11] <ibodi> try to copy txt from #ida to #idb
[19:50:28] <teka34>  is there any way to delay closing window by using UI dialog like alert()?
[19:52:16] <ibodi> ok fixed .
[19:52:29] <ibodi> 	$('.preLoad').each(function(){$(this).html($('#'+this.id+'Txt').html())});
[20:14:22] <gnarf> teka34: no
[20:16:57] <teka34> it runs befor closing the window but with no delay.
[20:19:59] <defaultro> hey folks, what does this code do -> var rm = rm || {};
[20:21:31] <Stephen> defaultro: If rm is false, null, or undefined, it makes rm = {}
[20:21:37] <Stephen> otherwise, it leaves it the same
[20:21:50] <defaultro> is it like tertiary condition?
[20:21:57] <Stephen> It's an OR
[20:22:01] <defaultro> ok
[20:22:03] <Stephen> rm OR new Object()
[20:22:37] <defaultro> so the 2nd rm is being checked if it exists?
[20:22:58] <Stephen> yup
[20:23:17] <defaultro> it's actually the first line of code that was written by my colleage
[20:23:20] <defaultro> officemate
[20:23:23] <Stephen> any value which would == false would create a new object
[20:23:27] <defaultro> ok
[20:23:49] <defaultro> i am having a hard time understanding his code, it's so complex
[20:24:02] <defaultro> i honestly like to learn how he codes
[20:24:03] <Stephen> I'd be happy to help
[20:24:17] <defaultro> ok
[20:24:24] <Stephen> Post it if you can
[20:24:27] <Stephen> I like deciphering
[20:58:55] <dr0id> anyone upgraded to jquery 1.8.0 and jqueryui 1.8.22 and found slider not working ?
[21:26:26] <dr0id> so now its $.browser.chrome and not $.browser.webkit , I think webkit one was better as it worked on webkit browsers, yeah ?
[21:26:46] <dr0id> across all webkit browsers*
[21:27:19] <IceTrAiN> nero: (bare with me as i'm not very experienced in jquery) you should be able to just write a simple function to check the positon of the scrolling and use the jquery .addClass and .removeClass functions, no?
[21:28:51] <coldhead> bear*
[21:29:02] <tw2113> beer?
[21:29:09] <coldhead> don't mind if i do!
[21:29:16] <tw2113> *toast*
[21:29:21] <tw2113> i wish i had a real one
[21:29:23] <tw2113> i just have water
[21:29:49] <dr0id> so upgraded to 1.8.0 - all good now :P
[21:30:13] <coldhead> i don't get beer for 2.5 more hours
[21:30:17] <coldhead> i am on water and snus
[21:30:24] <tw2113> WordPress 3.5 will have 1.8
[21:31:08] <dr0id> 1 crap using another crap, meh
[21:32:04] <dr0id> I thought 1.8 was getting rid of IE8 and below support that would lead to even more faster and better release. or maybe it was 2.0 :/
[21:32:28] <tw2113> yeah, you're a little early with that part
[21:41:06] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[21:41:47] <professor_chaos> hello
[21:42:13] <kurol> hello
[21:42:30] <dr0id> hello
[21:42:46] <coldhead> hello
[21:43:04] <coldhead> b-ot: tell ruby_on_tails hello
[21:43:04] <b-ot> coldhead, Iâ€™ll tell ruby_on_tails about that.
[21:43:53] <dr0id> so who is ready to make these google doodle kind games with me ?
[21:44:13] <kurol> can we use flash?
[21:44:18] * kurol hahahaha
[21:45:16] <dr0id> we could but then it will not work in iphone/ipad which is a must to support.
[21:45:43] <kurol> can we just iframe the doodle?
[21:46:07] <Stephen> Sure, but I'm not sure that you can show it in public
[21:46:21] * dr0id iframe's kurol
[21:47:15] <Stephen> I've grown tired of iframes. I'm bringing back old-school frames, and making my sites look like those vertical blinds from your apartment.
[21:47:28] <professor_chaos> NICE
[21:47:32] <Stephen> Only skilled chicken heads with thin eyes will be able to navigate my site
[21:48:40] <Stephen> All I need is a video of an honest looking neighbor to poke his head through the scene every once in a while to drive them all nuts
[21:48:53] <dr0id> ok
[21:51:44] <shoky> ok
[21:51:58] <Stephen> no
[21:56:53] <JJ23> Hi, my JQuery is, window.send_to_editor = function(html) { audiourl = jQuery('a',html).attr('href'); alert(html) is <a href="a/aaaaaaaa/aaa/etc">audioclip?</a> like that but alert(audiourl); is undefined, wts the problem here?>
[21:57:36] <Stephen> JJ23: Put quotes around html
[21:57:48] <Stephen> er, nm
[21:58:25] <ngharo> JJ23: just do jQuery(html).attr('href')
[21:58:46] <ngharo> since html _is_ an anchor
[21:59:17] <ngharo> there is not another anchor when using that anchor as your context (what your code is doing)
[21:59:22] <Stephen> wouldn't it be jQuery(html).children().attr('href')
[21:59:24] <ngharo> YO DAWGg
[21:59:59] <ngharo> the only child to his html there is a textnode
[22:00:05] <Stephen> YO DAWG, I put your object inside your object and made new objects from your objects so you could object to my objects
[22:00:08] <JJ23> Stephen, thanx
[22:00:21] <JJ23> ngharo, thnxdr
[22:00:27] <Stephen> html is a variable
[22:00:38] <Stephen> unfortunately, we have no idea what that value is
[22:00:52] <ngharo> dood he told us the value
[22:00:53] <Stephen> I propose an IRC scope passing method
[22:01:08] <Stephen> Oh, yeah, I read that totally wrong
[22:01:21] <Stephen> Like he was telling us html value AFTER the fact
[22:01:48] <Stephen> ngharo was correct
[22:01:51] <Stephen> I'm a douche
[22:02:28] <Krinkle> h-t-m-l is variable in the world. That's a fact, It's a thing we can't deny.
[22:02:28] * ngharo pats Stephen on the head
[22:02:45] * Krinkle hears Katie Melua singing in the background.
[22:05:59] <eirikb> I want to initially hide an element I'm going to later allow toggle. Is using .animate({width:'toggle'},0) a good approach? Example: http://jsfiddle.net/Mqft7
[22:07:26] <Stephen> toggling width, should be fine as long as it's not affecting anything else in the boxmodel
[22:07:42] <Stephen> Another method is .fadeOut()
[22:07:44] <eirikb> Stephen: Toggling the width works fine
[22:08:00] <eirikb> That is not the issue, I'm just wondering if using animate is the correct solution here
[22:08:22] <eirikb> It should not be, but I'm not sure how to do a initial close and still preserve the 'toggle' ability
[22:08:33] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/Mqft7/1/ this is better
[22:09:20] <eirikb> ngharo: Hmmm, I don't really control the CSS, I might be able to add some though
[22:10:12] <Stephen> eirikb: Another method would be to surround the animated object with a sized div, with overflow: hidden, and just move the inside div to the left
[22:10:24] <Stephen> A lot more work than what you've done here, but it's another approach
[22:10:29] <eirikb> I do not control any of the markup
[22:10:47] <eirikb> Even adding a style-tag might be difficult
[22:10:59] <Stephen> You have js access, right?
[22:11:14] <eirikb> Yes, so I could inject a style-tag, not very pretty though
[22:11:17] <Stephen> eh, I like your solution
[22:11:24] <Stephen> Earnestly, it's simple
[22:11:30] <Stephen> is it causing any other problems?
[22:11:45] <eirikb> Stephen: Nope, just a slight lag in IE, but that could be because of other things
[22:11:52] <eirikb> Such as my script being added with document.write
[22:11:52] <Stephen> If you plan on placing elements inside that black square, it could start looking strange
[22:13:36] <eirikb> ngharo: Stephen: Thanks for help :)
[22:22:14] <bigmeow> hi all
[22:22:25] <bigmeow> anybody here develop jquery using emacs here?
[22:22:56] <EasyCo> Hey guys, anybody know of a lightbox2 style plugin that does exactly what lightbox2 does but also shows a bit of the previous and next image on either side of the main image? Kinda like this: http://reneehadlow.com/
[22:54:05] <coldhead> bigmeow: yes
[22:54:08] <coldhead> i do
[22:54:14] <coldhead> i also IRC in emacs
[22:56:23] <mape> I'm having some issues with outerWidth on 1.8, similar to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12232 but instead of an invalid int it seems to be returning the jQuery object I call outerWidth on, trying to reproduce it on jsfiddle but doesn't seem to be straight forward
[22:56:36] <RPkS> I want to clean up my javascript, but I'm not sure how to go about it. My page speed rank is in the 90's, but the Defer Parsing of Javascript is a big F. http://puu.sh/QjY6
[22:57:17] <coldhead> RPkS: they want you to load your JS at the end of your html
[22:57:23] <coldhead> so everything else can load first
[22:57:25] <tw2113> ^
[22:57:34] <tw2113> if you can combine and minify as well, that'll help
[22:57:37] <coldhead> and then you'll want to concatenate your JS into a single file
[22:57:55] <coldhead> one single late request is the ideal
[22:59:30] <RPkS> coldhead: I have an extension that should be combining it, but I'm still seeing that message. I've read that sometimes you shouldn't just drag every script tag to the bottom.
[22:59:45] <RPkS> http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=6204&filter_search=minify%20cache&filter_license=1
[23:00:01] <coldhead> RPkS: the only time you shouldn't is when it breaks stuff
[23:00:10] <coldhead> and even then it's better to fix the JS than move it back up the top
[23:00:59] <coldhead> RPkS: i gather that extension isn't working
[23:01:09] <coldhead> you're definitely seeing multiple files being loaded
[23:02:09] <RPkS> So I need to move scripts from my header to the footer.tpl ---- it moved my page score WAY up, so it is working, but the addthis and comm100 stuff I have no control over. it's being pulled from their site.
[23:02:41] <RPkS> It might not compressing it all correctly, but it made a huge impact on raising my score
[23:19:11] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[23:19:46] <RPkS> Not so great by me. I'm siting here a bit lost. LOL
[23:20:36] <coldhead> what's the problem?
[23:22:02] <RPkS> I'm experimenting, but not seeing any results.
[23:25:39] <RPkS> I moved the ajax.googleapis line down and had 9 errors pop up. http://puu.sh/Qkmg
[23:26:15] <coldhead> ah, you need to ensure that jQuery is loaded before anything that uses jQuery
[23:26:40] <jecks> hello codehead
[23:26:49] <coldhead> hello jecks
[23:27:05] <jecks> am having a problem with the latest jquery
[23:27:17] <jecks> after last nite update
[23:27:34] <jecks> i discovered that some of my functions are no more working
[23:27:38] <coldhead> that's very sad
[23:27:48] <jecks> any help on that?
[23:28:03] <coldhead> you'll have to be more specific
[23:28:25] <coldhead> from what you've said so far the only advice i can give is try restarting your computer and try using an earlier version of jQuery
[23:28:25] <jecks> ok
[23:29:04] <jecks> yes that's what am using
[23:29:15] <ENQ> about ajax, i use type='DELETE' why it call error callback even response is 200?
[23:29:27] <jecks> i just found out that jquery was updated
[23:29:35] <jecks> last 9te
[23:29:46] <jecks> to v.1.8.0
[23:29:59] <coldhead> you don't have to use it, jecks
[23:30:03] <coldhead> you can use the older version
[23:30:14] <coldhead> i usually wait until the next .1 or .2
[23:30:16] <ENQ> nvm i fixed it :)
[23:30:18] <coldhead> for bug fixes
[23:30:24] <coldhead> good work ENQ
[23:30:25] <jecks> ok
[23:30:40] <ENQ> was returning bad data type :)
[23:30:49] <jecks> thanks alot
[23:30:55] <jecks> @ coldhead
[23:31:03] <coldhead> good luck jecks !
[23:36:52] <RPkS> I might as well be on Mars. I can learn anything, but I have so much on my plate that diving into JS is just too much to add to the plate.
[23:37:17] <abjorn> gnarf: shout out in the jquery blog, HOOLLLAAAA
[23:38:12] <abjorn> sup coldhead
[23:40:44] <coldhead> hej abjsy
[23:41:26] <abjorn> sleep deprivation is awwesssomme
[23:41:32] <abjorn> i mean, not really, but, you know
[23:43:36] <coldhead> it has awesome aspects
[23:43:44] <coldhead> like how much shit you can get done
[23:43:56] <coldhead> and negative aspects: like how shit anything you get done turns out
[23:44:35] <RPkS> Amen on that comment
[23:44:36] <hrwath> ;-)
[23:47:16] <abjorn> coldhead: well, im at a point where i cant get anything done cause i cant think straight or concentrate lol
[23:47:37] <abjorn> i pulled an all nighter last night, i finally got a couple of hours sleep a little while ago but that's like two hours in the last 36 lol
[23:47:54] <coldhead> this is either the time to step into your home studio and hit record or play a lot of some video game
[23:48:05] <coldhead> can you finish zelda skyward sword for me? i've lost momentum
[23:48:39] <abjorn> lol man
[23:48:45] <abjorn> i bought that game, played it for like four hours
[23:48:50] <abjorn> and havent touched it since then, in like months
[23:49:00] <abjorn> idk why, its a good game
[23:49:00] <RPkS> I'm sitting with a nasty sinus infection
[23:49:10] <abjorn> thats always fun
[23:50:31] <coldhead> skyward sword is too big
[23:50:43] <coldhead> oh look, another vast ruined temple filled with traps
[23:51:05] <coldhead> and apparently zelda was inside recently or someone who met her once has a postcard of it or something
[23:51:14] <coldhead> so you'd better explore every inch for some reason
[23:51:38] <mazzachre> I have an interesting problem... We need some tooltips (really simple) but the data to show is not always there, so we need ajax calls to fetch the data... Not really difficult code (Just made a small prototype with hoverIntent) however, the user can easily move the mouse from the time we start the ajax call to the time the data gets presented, in which case currently the tooltip is shown until the object is hovered on again...
[23:51:41] <coldhead> I ONLY BOUGHT THE GAME BECAUSE RALPHHOLZMANN'S KIDS WERE DROPPING KITTENS OFF THE EDGE OF THE FLOATING ISLAND
[23:52:21] <coldhead> mazzachre: so you want like hoverPreIntent that can tell when a user is going to hover before it happens?
[23:55:55] <mazzachre> coldhead: Hehe, that would be nice... but what kind of programming language would you do that in?! I do have a few solutions up my sleeve, one is to not let the ajax callback open the tooltip but simply show a placeholder and fill it out when data comes... Another would be to delay the tooltip with a simple timeout and in the out, both trigger a hide and if the timeout is running, also kill that...
[23:56:28] <coldhead> i would just load all the tooltips as soon as the page loads
[23:56:33] <coldhead> then they're all ready to go
[23:57:06] <mazzachre> coldhead: You could do the hoverPreIntent as larger than element boxes, in higher z index, make them transparent and trigger hover on them :)
[23:57:37] <coldhead> man i definitely need some quality time with my bucket bong to start getting my head around that
[23:58:03] <mazzachre> coldhead: That would be a load of data to load... I don't think that is an option currently...
[23:58:12] <mazzachre> coldhead: I suggest pills :)
[23:58:57] <coldhead> can't you just add the tooltips at the time you create the buttons?
[23:59:04] <coldhead> like on the serverside?
