[00:00:11] <russpete> will do, thanks
[00:01:49] <iamjon-work> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/ZmKnz/
[00:04:18] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/ZmKnz/1/ what about that
[00:04:50] <Trisox> thats how i do it... most of the times
[00:06:37] <russpete> Trisox: amzaing what a little jsfiddle will help one see the light
[00:06:53] <Trisox> :O
[00:07:02] <Trisox> jsfiddle is the bomb
[00:07:12] <Trisox> i do most of my prototyping in there
[00:07:47] <iamjon-work> Trisox: so once I do the console log, jquery gives me an object with an array, I want to get the nicely formatted string that is used to descibe the array
[00:07:48] <iamjon-work> http://clip2net.com/s/Xjnk
[00:08:22] <Trisox> ah k
[00:08:38] <iamjon-work> Trisox :)
[00:08:51] <Trisox> well you can get the class with .attr('class')
[00:09:19] <Trisox> just put that after the parent().parent()
[00:09:28] <Trisox> no need for .div
[00:09:41] <iamjon-work> Trisox, cool thank you very much
[00:09:58] <Trisox> np ;)
[00:10:04] <Trisox> btw if you want to filter classes out
[00:10:26] <wkmanire> parent().parent().bo().barent().banafana().fo().farent()
[00:10:29] <Trisox> you could also do .replace(/thisiswhatgetremoved/ig, "")
[00:10:52] <Trisox> wkmanire: what your rambeling on about?
[00:11:16] <wkmanire> Trisox: wat?
[00:11:17] <iamjon-work> Trisox, thank you, I'll try that
[00:11:39] <Trisox> np gl iamjon-work

[01:20:43] <Whirl3d> I know this is the jquery channel, but I need some help with CSS/jquery. I need to get my css right so that I can build a resize handler for a div. I just can't figure out the css. Anbody feel extra generous and willing to take a wack at it? I have a jpg of what I want the layout to be, but just can't get it right. anybody?
[01:21:29] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/test/pageDesign.jpg
[01:24:22] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I was afraid of that. It seems like it would be such a simple task to make a div with 3 rows (header/body/footer) and place it in the body of another div (made of 3 rows--header/body-footer)...but I can't figure it out at all.
[01:32:38] <Whirl3d> nvm, I just setup a loop to try every possible combination until it looked right. Got it! LOL Thanks for your help though.

[01:55:21] <siebo> I'm trying to write a jQuery script to replace Â® in <h1>'s with <sup>&reg;</sup>
[01:55:56] <siebo> I think I'm having a problem getting js to recognize the Â® character
[01:56:15] <scrieler> someString.replace(/\s/, "-");
[01:56:27] <siebo> when I view the script in the browser, it shows up as some weird Ã‚Â®
[01:57:01] <siebo> let me make sure it's actually finding the Â®'s
[01:57:57] <siebo> scrieler: this is the code I'm using
[01:57:58] <siebo> http://pastie.org/1965233
[01:58:37] <scrieler> try \®
[01:59:13] <lisak> does anybody know the answer ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6107835/is-it-possible-to-upload-file-via-ajaxoptions-or-xhr-sendfile-only
[02:00:19] <Cork> lisak: yes if your ok with demanding support for html5 file api in the browser
[02:00:21] <Cork> else no
[02:00:47] <siebo> scrieler: it's still not firing the replace
[02:01:01] <DoctorDarren> Hey, I need to make a calendar that lists the days of the month each employee is working. On the Y axis I'm putting the names listed vertically, and on the top of the X axis I'm putting the days 1 - 31. Anybody know of some existing calendar plugins like this or will I have to roll from scratch?
[02:01:07] <siebo> and when I view the script in firefox, the \Â® shows up as \Ã‚Â®
[02:01:38] <lisak> Cork, well I'm trying half an hour and so far it seems that xhr.send(file); is the only way to create a multipart request
[02:02:03] <lisak> there is just no way to do that via $.ajax(options)
[02:02:11] <lisak> unless you use FormData
[02:02:27] <siebo> I added an alert() inside the function, but it's not firing
[02:02:32] <lisak> which is cutting edge feature with weak support
[02:02:35] <siebo> leading me to thing that it's not finding the Â®'s
[02:04:39] <scrieler> siebo, do u have a utf8 problem?

[02:12:56] <jamov> what do you guys use for setting the caret position to the end in textareas?
[02:22:16] <cjheath> I have a span with a dblclick handler, which fires nicely, but the preceeding text highlights (like a selection highlight). What  do I have to do with the event to stop that? (Tried return values from the dblclick handler, calling preventDefault, stopImmediatePropagation, etc). This is in Chrome.
[02:22:56] <jmvelasco> hello, good morning from a human being living the #spanishrevolution :p, even if now I am just selling my time :)
[02:23:40] <cjheath> Good evening (19:23 PM here)
[02:23:55] <jmvelasco> learning purposes: I saw this line $('form[name=myform]').get(0).reset(); to reset a form, why get(0) ? thanks in advance
[02:24:03] <jmvelasco> cjheath, good evening there then :)
[02:24:24] <cjheath> Any thoughts on my question?
[02:24:42] <eml> cjheath: sec
[02:24:42] <Cork> jmvelasco: .get() is the same as[], it grabs the dom element instead of the default jquery object
[02:25:03] <Cork> jmvelasco: .reset() is a dom function, it doesn't exist in jquery
[02:25:48] <jmvelasco> nive, thanks cork
[02:25:54] <jmvelasco> s/nive/nice
[02:26:04] <cjheath> Cork: http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.get says ,.get is a shorthand AJAX function?
[02:26:17] <eml> cjheath: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/ this might be what you're looking for
[02:26:28] <cjheath> eml:Thanks, I'll try it now
[02:26:32] <eml> cjheath: actually I guess it's not. :p
[02:26:33] <codemagician> I have a TABLE with individual entries per row.  I want to have a button on each row that opens a modal dialog form.  How do I get the primary key from the table TD in the jquery code please?
[02:26:56] <jonee> ajax submit form but stay on page- anybody with a code snippet?
[02:27:06] <eml> cjheath: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1728790/stop-selecting-text-on-a-table-element
[02:27:16] <Cork> cjheath: thats $.get, not $().get
[02:27:26] <cjheath> oooh, right
[02:27:44] <cjheath> eml: stopPropagation didn't work
[02:27:50] <eml> cjheath: see /\
[02:28:18] <cjheath> Yes, thankyou
[02:29:10] <codemagician> http://pastebin.com/Aih6Vgh3
[02:29:15] <cjheath> It shows Firefox, IS and "Opera etc"... doesn;t worj in Chrome
[02:29:21] <cjheath> *IE
[02:29:33] <codemagician> how do I get the property id value on line 15 please using jquery?
[02:29:58] <codemagician> if I attach a modal dialog form to the .setUrl A tag
[02:29:58] <eml> cjheath: You've tried it so you know you've applied the code correctly? IOW: it works in firefox/IE for you?
[02:30:17] <cjheath> Not tried those yet. But the console.log is showing correctly
[02:30:33] <Cork> codemagician: give taht td a class, then select on it and get it through .text() see ?.text
[02:30:33] <bot-t> codemagician, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[02:30:43] <cjheath> Ohm it's tehj dblclick event, maybe the click event is causing the problem?
[02:31:00] <eml> cjheath: You know what, nevermind I guess. That's not for double clicking. But maybe it sparks some ideas. I'm sure you can google the answer
[02:31:11] <Cork> codemagician: you could also grab it through 'tr td:first'
[02:31:18] <Cork> but then it has to alway be the first td
[02:31:20] <cjheath> Thanks, I'm experiementing
[02:31:27] <cjheath> you've been v helpful!
[02:32:37] <codemagician> Cork, but the page will have many TR's, how do I say "the one that this anchor was called on"
[02:33:00] <Cork> ?.closest @ codemagician
[02:33:00] <bot-t> codemagician, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:33:08] <codemagician> Cork, as the modal form dialog is attached to the .setUrl classes
[02:33:30] <Cork> codemagician: attached?
[02:33:47] <Cork> as far as i know, dialogs doesn't have a connection to the element that displays it
[02:34:03] <codemagician> Cork, http://pastebin.com/zimZkaHf
[02:34:44] <codemagician> Cork, http://pastebin.com/qRbh2UGe
[02:34:47] <Cork> codemagician: ya, but the buttons in the dialog doesn't have a ref to .selURL
[02:34:55] <Cork> it only have a ref to the dialog
[02:35:10] <Cork> so you need to stor a ref to this when you open the dialog
[02:35:20] <Cork> else you lose where you are
[02:35:40] <codemagician> Cork, my ultimate result is to populate the form by using AJAX, but I need the id of the row that the modal dialog was called on
[02:35:43] <khurram> hi all
[02:36:10] <Cork> codemagician: thats doable, but you need to store a ref to the link when its clicked
[02:36:20] <Cork> else the buttons in the dialog can't find it
[02:36:38] <codemagician> Cork, is it the best practice to grab the id from the TR TD first or would it be better to use a URL inside the A tag?
[02:36:38] <KiiK> is it possible to get it work if I don't want to wrap them in dom ready. http://jsfiddle.net/Lu59q/
[02:36:45] <khurram> i am adding new divs in a table <tr> <td> <div id='myDiv<?php echo id ?>' > .. </div> <td >  on a click event i want to remove that particular row from the visible table how can i do this in jquery
[02:36:55] <Cork> codemagician: ok, lets back up
[02:37:03] <Cork> codemagician: where exactly do you need the id?
[02:37:10] <cjheath> eml: Done using css "user-select" and the browser-specific equivalents
[02:37:25] <Cork> codemagician: at alert("boom")?
[02:37:43] <stanza> hi guys! anyone knows if a carousel with categories exists? thank you
[02:37:54] <eml> cjheath: Kewl =)
[02:38:13] <codemagician> Cork, im not actually sure. what I want to do is fill the form when the user selects the table row "set url" button
[02:38:45] <codemagician> Cork, to be able to populate the form, I was going to use an AJAX call based on the primary key which is available in the first TD of each TW
[02:38:50] <codemagician> *TR
[02:39:37] <codemagician> Cork, but i wasn't sure if I should peek at the value in the <tr><td>...</td>  box, or have a url inside the <a href="#.... here">
[02:39:41] <Cork> codemagician: is the form meant to be shown in the dialog?
[02:40:01] <Cork> codemagician: the finding is farly easy, but i need to understand what your trying to do first
[02:40:01] <khurram> can i show the animation on the remove method so that it gives fadding away or hiding effect ?
[02:40:04] <codemagician> Cork, yes the form will be shown but I want it filled with values based on the specific row chosen
[02:40:18] <Cork> codemagician: yes.... but when... T_T
[02:40:26] <Cork> when you open the dialog?
[02:40:37] <codemagician> Cork, its an edit modal dialog. yes as it loads :)
[02:40:52] <toxz> hi! i want to put a function into a separate file. what is the best way to make it accesible in another scripts then? extending the $ ?
[02:41:09] <Cork> ok, then in the button callback use $(this).closest('tr') and work from there
[02:41:37] <Cork> codemagician: and you prob want to make the ajax call and show the dialog in the callback
[02:41:39] <khurram> coldhead: ?
[02:41:48] <Trisox[work]> coldhead
[02:41:55] <_ramo> how do i get the value of <a>lkjljsdf</a> that's between the <a> tags ?
[02:42:09] <patbam> _ramo: $('a').text()
[02:42:27] <khurram> Trisox: do you know how to show fadding out effect on removing an item ?
[02:42:42] <Trisox[work]> sure
[02:43:03] <_ramo> patbam: thank you
[02:43:10] <codemagician> Cork, i understand. where can I learn about selecting the first TD from the TR please?
[02:43:12] <patbam> _ramo: sure
[02:43:33] <patbam> codemagician: $('td tr:first') should work
[02:43:35] <Cork> codemagician: .find('td:first')
[02:44:00] <Cork> no not $(), as this is going to be added to closest
[02:44:37] <patbam> woops i was backwards: $('tr td:first')
[02:44:45] <Cork> no
[02:44:48] <Cork> still wrong
[02:44:55] <seutje> that sounds wrong on so many levels
[02:45:14] <codemagician> Cork, I see.  In my example, the url is actually already in field 6 of the TR, so could I take it from there instead of making an AJAX call?  Also, what if it were a text field would and contained &quot; etc. how to I process it back to plain data... :)
[02:45:25] <Cork> codemagician: the full line should be $(this).closest('tr').children('td:first')
[02:46:34] <Cork> codemagician: you could if you like
[02:47:00] <Cork> should be something like $(this).closest('tr').children().eq(5) then
[02:47:26] <codemagician> Cork, sometimes I will be forced to use AJAX because I might be using the Primary Key to gather data from a joining table that isn't already shown in the view.  But is it generally consider okay practice to pull values from the form elements?
[02:47:57] <Cork> codemagician: from form elements?
[02:48:19] <Cork> codemagician: or do you mean table cells?
[02:48:21] <_ramo> patbam: this doesn't work: jQuery('a').live('click', function() { clickedlink = this.href; alert(this.text()); });
[02:48:21] <codemagician> Cork, sorry I meant from the TR TD elements
[02:48:25] <_ramo> what am i doing wrong?
[02:48:28] <codemagician> Cork, yes sorry :)
[02:48:47] <Cork> codemagician: its farly slow to grab text from cells, but its ok
[02:49:10] <patbam> _ramo: do not think this "this" means what you think it means. you need to do:
[02:49:26] <codemagician> Cork, i was wondering if I had a <td>some &quote; text</td> does jquery have a way to convert html entities back?
[02:49:35] <Cork> _ramo: you need to use $(this).text() text() is a jquery function
[02:49:36] <ryrych> hi, how can I handle a 404 error using JSONP? I get this error but .error() canâ€™t handle it
[02:49:45] <patbam> jQuery('a').live('click', function(a) { var $a = $(a); clickedlink = $a.attr('href'); alert($a.text()); });
[02:49:47] <ravenzz> _ramo jQuery('a').live('click', function() { var clickedLink = $(this).attr('href'); alert($(this).text()) });
[02:49:47] <codemagician> Cork, or should one grab the PK and 'pull' using a GET request
[02:49:52] <albacker> can i test the keycode if im using keyup?
[02:49:57] <toxz> is there any tutorial available how to split the js/jquery code of one site into multiple files?
[02:50:04] <Cork> codemagician: it happens by default, but you can't get the entity
[02:50:19] <patbam> _ramo: yeah ravenzz 's is the same and cleaner :)
[02:50:51] <codemagician> Cork, so by default I would get     some " text  inside the jquery variables
[02:50:51] <Aamir> albacker:  yes .keyup(function(event){ event.keyCode })
[02:51:00] <Cork> codemagician: yes
[02:51:08] <codemagician> Cork, thats great
[02:51:15] <albacker> Aamir, thanks
[02:51:26] <_ramo> thank you
[02:51:47] <_ramo> i always miss the difference between $(this) and this
[02:51:48] <_ramo> ...
[02:51:52] <_ramo> confusing one
[02:52:29] <Cork> _ramo: in an event this is the dom object, and $(this) is the jquery form
[02:52:46] <Cork> so if you want to access jquery functions wrap it, else use this
[02:53:10] <_ramo> Cork: thank you
[02:53:15] <Cork> np
[02:53:32] <_ramo> one more issue... how do i solve the problem from using $ and jQuery? for now i have always to use jQuery(...
[02:53:55] <Cork> _ramo: you have another framework on your page?
[02:53:58] <codemagician> Cork, thanks for your help
[02:54:10] <_ramo> Cork: no
[02:54:10] <Cork> codemagician: yw
[02:54:19] <patbam> _ramo: sorry, just checked my version doesn't work at all O.o
[02:54:22] <Cork> _ramo: then $ should work just fine
[02:54:59] <_ramo> patbam: my is working now: jQuery('a').live('click', function() { var clickedLink = $(this).attr('href'); alert($(this).text()) }); ;)
[02:55:16] <_ramo> Cork firebug is always telling me that $ is undefined
[02:55:20] <_ramo> with jQuery it works
[02:55:24] <_ramo> jQuery(..)
[02:55:29] <Cork> _ramo: thats cause firefox overloads it
[02:55:29] <patbam> _ramo: cool
[02:55:36] <albacker> is it possible to execute a 'click' ?
[02:55:36] <albacker> from a function?
[02:55:36] <albacker> something like if (keyCode==13) $("#foo#).click(); ?
[02:55:39] <Cork> $ = jQuery; fixes that
[02:55:46] <seutje> ?trigger @ albacker
[02:55:48] <bot-t> albacker, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[02:55:48] <Cork> _ramo: sorry firebug
[02:56:11] <_ramo> hm, okay
[02:56:12] <ravenzz> _ramo or just try to put that code into (function(){ yourcode })();
[02:56:30] <_ramo> ravenzz: but when will be that executed?
[02:56:30] <albacker> seutje, thanks
[02:56:37] <ravenzz> on document ready
[02:56:38] <ravenzz> io suppose
[02:56:44] <Cork> _ramo: firebug offers some of its function through $, thats why
[02:56:55] <ravenzz> io <- lol
[02:57:15] <patbam> anyone ever seen an effect like this done in jquery? http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/minisites/nabokov/index.html
[02:57:15] <ravenzz> io is the italian for i :f
[03:04:55] <khurram> is there any way i can request DOM to start his process from of parsing from a specific point in the document ?
[03:07:06] <catcatcat> is there any easy way to convert jquery to javascript?
[03:07:39] <ravenzz> jquery is javascript
[03:08:09] <coldhead> ?jqijs
[03:08:12] <bot-t> coldhead, Couldn't find "jqijs" in jQuery Docs.
[03:08:14] <coldhead> ?js
[03:08:14] <bot-t> coldhead: Syntax: ? js <javascript code>
[03:08:20] <coldhead> BAH
[03:08:28] <ravenzz> ahh fail
[03:08:32] <_ramo> can i test, if a variable is defined or not?
[03:08:37] <ravenzz> sure
[03:09:08] <Aamir> ?get @catcatcat
[03:09:09] <bot-t> catcatcat, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[03:09:26] <catcatcat> ravenzz: i know jquery is js, but i want to change it to normal js
[03:09:39] <Aamir> _ralph:   if(myvar)
[03:09:56] <coldhead> ?jsisjs
[03:09:56] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[03:09:57] <_ramo> ravenzz: just if(typeof myvariable == 'undefined') ? or is there another, better way?
[03:10:07] <coldhead> that's the one i wanted, thanks bot-t
[03:10:14] <albacker> is it possible to store a JSON object in JS after doing a $.post()? and then re-use it later in time? I'm doing something like var user; $.post(..., function(data) { user=data.user}); but when i'm trying to access to any of user's fields it says that it's undefined (firebug says..). Any idea what might be causing this behaviour?
[03:11:17] <Aamir> albacker:  var user is updated inside callback function. you will have to wait for the callback to update user so u can can get the json
[03:11:32] <ravenzz> catcatcat i see, so i suppose you have to take a look at google, i don't know a tool that can traslate jquery code to plain js
[03:11:32] <Jester831> is there any reason why var bar = 'bar'; jQuery('#foo .' + bar') wouldn't work whereas jQuery('#foo .bar') would?
[03:11:44] <Jester831> while**
[03:11:56] <Cork> albacker: sure you can do something like window.user = data;
[03:11:58] <ravenzz> you should remove a quote
[03:12:03] <Cork> that way your sure it will be global
[03:12:03] <ravenzz> jest
[03:12:19] <Jester831> no, that was a typo
[03:12:32] <Aamir> jessecrouch:   var bar = '.bar'; jQuery('irc://irc.freenode.net/#foo .' + bar)
[03:12:34] <Jester831> its still jQuery('foo' + bar)
[03:12:37] <albacker> Aamir, i'll see if i can put a function call at the end of the callback just to signalise that the user is "there".
[03:12:40] <ravenzz> even if bar is a variable
[03:12:59] <TornUp> can anyone help with this problem, this will work in Chrome/firefox but not in IE :S http://jsfiddle.net/LgJsN/1435/
[03:13:03] <Aamir> :/
[03:13:59] <albacker> Cork, what does window.user mean? is window something "above" the document object (node) ?
[03:15:16] <Cork> albacker: the global scope in a webpage is object on the window object
[03:15:28] <Cork> so adding a member to window means making it page global
[03:15:48] <albacker> Cork, ok thanks. This is waht i needed.
[03:15:50] <albacker> :)
[03:16:01] <Cork> albacker: if you in the head of a page writes user = 10; its the same as doing window.user = 10; anywhere in the page
[03:17:41] <catcatcat> ravenzz: thanks
[03:18:26] <ravenzz> have you find something?
[03:22:08] <ravenzz> i should improve my english skills, who would host me for a while? :f
[03:24:28] <khurram> how can i make a big table with lots of inline styles in it inside a success function i am getting  unterminated string errors  ?
[03:24:54] <ravenzz> ?p @ khurram

[03:26:27] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Anybody know of a way to implement jQueryUI draggable/resizable behavior with scrolling content? I've asked before, but figured I would ask one last time...
[03:26:56] <ravenzz> lovely tables lol
[03:27:11] <khurram> :)
[03:27:31] <ryrych> anyone knows? :)
[03:27:47] <ryrych> Iâ€™ll asked again: how can I handle a 404 error using JSONP? I get this error but .error() canâ€™t handle it
[03:28:05] <RandomSort> Whirl3d: You neeed to distinguish between clicks on the scrollbar and clicks on the whole frame
[03:28:13] <khurram> any idea?
[03:28:19] <RandomSort> should be doable but it wont be pretyt, and probably quite cumbersome
[03:29:47] <seutje> khurram: u can't just split it like that
[03:30:16] <khurram> what should i do i want to insert a new row into the parent table ?
[03:30:52] <seutje> the fact that the syntax highlighting for a string ends at the line break doesn't give it away?
[03:31:10] <ravenzz> ryrych error:function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError){ console.log(xhr.status) }
[03:31:13] <ravenzz> maybe work
[03:31:43] <khurram> do you mean i should right all that in a single line to make it work ?
[03:33:12] <_ramo> hm, can anyone give me a hint, why this is not alerting anything: http://jsfiddle.net/r9me5/ ?
[03:34:18] <quicksilver> ramontayag: because that's a button. Not a submit. Clicking it will not submit the form.
[03:34:36] <quicksilver> (unless you give it a click handler to do so of course)
[03:34:44] <quicksilver> _ramo: ^^ that was for you.
[03:35:28] <_ramo> quicksilver: ups...so you mean i should replace submit with click ?
[03:35:47] <_ramo> that could do the job
[03:35:55] <quicksilver> in a sense.
[03:35:55] <ravenzz> you shoudl replace type="button" with type="submit"
[03:35:58] <markj> ryrych you want, statusCode: { 404: function () { } } if you want to specifically target a 404, but i dont see why you cant with error?
[03:36:01] <quicksilver> but do you actually want the form to get submitted?
[03:36:06] <quicksilver> if so you want it to be a submit button P
[03:36:17] <markj> check the statusCode part on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax
[03:37:27] <TornUp> can anyone help with this problem, this will work in Chrome/firefox but not in IE :S http://jsfiddle.net/LgJsN/1435/
[03:37:43] <_ramo> quicksilver: yeah i know.. but that's  code from a designer... but the applicatoin is still finding some search results....
[03:37:51] <codemagician> Cork, following our chat earlier i've got the TR TD to highlight on the button callback, but I'm stuck trying to pull the value from the jquery object itself
[03:37:54] <_ramo> the the values are somehow submitted
[03:39:12] <ryrych> ravenzz: but JSONP doesn't return XHR
[03:39:28] <ravenzz> yes sorry my fault
[03:39:49] <ravenzz> _ramo you should prevent the submit
[03:40:04] <codemagician> Anyone..  var idPropertyTd = $(this).closest('tr').children('td:first'); gives me the jquery object, but how to I get the contents of the TD cell?
[03:40:12] <_ramo> ravenzz: why and how? :)
[03:41:37] <seutje> ?text @ codemagician
[03:41:38] <bot-t> codemagician, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[03:41:46] <ravenzz> _ramo you wouldn't submit the form right?
[03:42:21] <seutje> codemagician: if u want unfiltered shizzle, use html
[03:43:38] <_ramo> ravenzz: actually the search terms are submitted somehow, if i click the button, or hit return, i get a search result
[03:44:56] <minver> Is there a way to make my Placeholder fallback to be Live so ajax elements are effected? http://pastie.org/1965547
[03:45:55] <ravenzz> _ramo ok..but you want stop the submit?
[03:46:51] <_ramo> no, i just want to get the values, that are in the searchbar
[03:46:52] <_ramo> :)
[03:47:23] <_ramo> if a click the button or i hit enter... it should make no differenct, in both ways, i would like the data entered into the searchfield
[03:47:52] <ravenzz> ok sorry i am working so i am inattentive sometimes
[03:49:22] <_ramo> ravenzz: no problem
[03:49:51] <codemagician> how do I pass my own javascript variables into $("#seturl-form").dialog("open") ?
[03:51:27] <codemagician> i.e. to avoid using global variables
[03:51:47] <zfkevin> how do i set a value for a hidden input field ?
[03:52:39] <zfkevin> $("#id").value("3"); doesnt work
[03:52:44] <zfkevin> on text field it does
[03:53:41] <_ramo> how can i cascade the order of id's when i would like to bind a event to a special tag with a special id? like <form id="form1"><div id="div1"><div id="div2"><a ... ?
[03:53:53] <abraxxa> should this selector work? "th[class=plain],td[class=plain]"
[03:54:12] <abraxxa> i've just upgraded one of my apps from jQuery 1.5 to 1.6.1 and it only finds the th's but not the td's
[03:54:18] <ravenzz> _ramo http://jsfiddle.net/c7tfr/1/
[03:55:14] <_ramo> ravenzz: cool, i'll test it in this structure here
[03:55:17] <_ramo> thank you
[03:55:45] <abraxxa> never mind, the problem seems to be a fixed but because i need ~= instead of =
[03:56:26] <Famic> hi
[03:57:42] <quicksilver> abraxxa: why would you not use "th.plain,td.plain" for that?
[03:57:47] <ravenzz> _ramo oh you should check whether a value is empty
[03:57:59] <Famic> is there a place to get help on jquerymobile ? #jquerymobile exists but doesn't seems active at all
[03:58:31] <_ramo> ravenzz: just a moment please, i'll try to extend the whole code... to show you where i want to go
[03:58:41] <ravenzz> ok
[03:59:21] <MorpheusXnl> goodafternoon all
[04:00:07] <MorpheusXnl> can someone tell me why $("#after").hide("slow");
[04:00:07] <MorpheusXnl>          $("#middle .src").fadeIn("slow"); that only hide works and if i do $("#after").hide("slow", function(){
[04:00:07] <MorpheusXnl>        $("#middle .src").fadeIn("slow");
[04:00:07] <MorpheusXnl> }) it does work
[04:00:17] <_ramo> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/c7tfr/2/  the button is just of type "button" and not "submit" in our case here.
[04:00:28] <_ramo> do you know what i mean?
[04:01:54] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/c7tfr/3/
[04:02:08] <MorpheusXnl> anyone?
[04:02:23] <_ramo> ravenzz: you just removed the e.preventDefault() function?
[04:02:37] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: i failed to parse that question
[04:02:45] <ravenzz> _ramo also i add an .parent()
[04:02:52] <_ramo> ah
[04:03:08] <_ramo> cool, i'll test it
[04:03:11] <ravenzz> you don't need e.preventDefault() because the button doesn't submit the form
[04:03:17] <MorpheusXnl> Cork, what do you mean, you don't know what i asked
[04:03:54] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: i can't find what your asking in there
[04:04:16] <ravenzz> MorpheusXnl you should paste your code somewhere, so we can test it
[04:04:22] <ravenzz> ?p @ MorpheusXnl
[04:04:22] <bot-t> MorpheusXnl, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[04:04:32] <MorpheusXnl> one moment
[04:04:35] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: and explain a bit better what you have problem with
[04:04:44] <MorpheusXnl> $("#after").hide("slow");
[04:04:44] <MorpheusXnl>          $("#middle .src").fadeIn("slow");
[04:04:46] <Cork> cause that question up there doesn't make sence
[04:04:48] <Cork> no
[04:04:55] <Cork> in see ?p
[04:04:55] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[04:05:00] <MorpheusXnl> this only executes hide and i don't know why
[04:05:12] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: ok
[04:05:19] <Cork> animations is async
[04:05:30] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  src is ur class name ?
[04:05:31] <Cork> you need to do folloup animation in the callback
[04:05:37] <MorpheusXnl> but when i code it like $("#after").hide("slow", function(){
[04:05:37] <MorpheusXnl>        $("#middle .src").fadeIn("slow");
[04:05:37] <MorpheusXnl> }) it works and i don't understand why
[04:05:44] <Aamir> ?p @MorpheusXnl
[04:05:44] <bot-t> MorpheusXnl, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[04:06:13] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  should it be $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#middle ").fadeIn("slow");
[04:06:22] <MorpheusXnl> Aamir, yes is my class name
[04:06:22] <Aamir> eeehhhh :x
[04:06:32] <Aamir> than ?demo @MorpheusXnl
[04:06:37] <Aamir> ?demo @MorpheusXnl
[04:06:38] <bot-t> MorpheusXnl, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:07:11] <MorpheusXnl> Aamir, i don't have a live site yet for you to look at.
[04:07:23] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: read what bot-t says...
[04:07:30] <_ramo> hm, ravenzz really stragen.... the click event for the button doesn't react here...
[04:07:42] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  make a quick simple demo so u get help
[04:08:02] <codemagician> how to I pass a custom var though to $dialog.dialog('open') ?
[04:08:14] <MorpheusXnl> ok one sec
[04:08:32] <Cork> codemagician: attach it to the dialog dom see ?.data
[04:08:32] <bot-t> codemagician, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:08:34] <MorpheusXnl> because it are multiple files that get called
[04:08:54] <Aamir> codemagician: u can use http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-open
[04:08:57] <Cork> MorpheusXnl: so make a reduced testcase
[04:09:31] <_ramo> ravenzz: even if i do a jQuery('#submitQueryBtn').click(function(){alert("test");});  do you have an idea, what this could be?
[04:09:35] <ravenzz> _ramo "here" where? :p
[04:09:38] <zfkevin> is it possible with jquery to set value of hidden field ?
[04:09:53] <_ramo> hehe
[04:10:13] <codemagician> Aamir, i have an event on my button which grabs a value from a TR TD, I want to pass it into the modal dialog for use inside that
[04:10:26] <shaggy_> Could someone please help me? I'm trying to setup a Accept/Deny friends page where they can (obviously) accept or reject friend requests. It's using jquery .post to submit and I want to also try to get it to hide the person they respond to (based on click) BUT the problem is if there is more than one it only attempts to submit information for the FIRST entities information.
[04:10:42] <_ramo> ravenzz: i'm testing it on my local machine
[04:10:52] <SkiOne> Hi, I am trying to figure out a way of removing all instances of a class after a specified one
[04:10:58] <codemagician> http://pastebin.com/yWi5PZme
[04:11:07] <SkiOne> by class I mean a div with a class
[04:11:08] <codemagician> line 29 is my broken attempt
[04:11:11] <Aamir> codemagician:  not sure what u want but try saving the value in button.data and get it back on http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-open
[04:11:17] <ravenzz> _ramo then make a fiddle on jsfiddle
[04:11:29] <_ramo> okay
[04:13:00] <MorpheusXnl> i am working on it almost finished
[04:13:07] <codemagician> Cork, do I really need to use the DOM to pass my already grabbed value around the jquery code?
[04:13:15] <codemagician> Cork, http://pastebin.com/yWi5PZme
[04:13:35] <Cork> codemagician: you prob don't want to send the data to dialog at all
[04:13:49] <_ramo> ravenzz: in jsfiddle it works: http://jsfiddle.net/c7tfr/4/ ... but why doesn't it work on my machine? what could be different here? http://jsfiddle.net/c7tfr/4/
[04:13:52] <_ramo> ups
[04:14:07] <Cork> codemagician: just do $dialog.load(<url>, function() { $dialog.dialog('open'); });
[04:14:22] <Pasti> Hi, i'm having a little bit trouble using jquery to do a selection on a result-set from a previous jquery-selector. var myouterdiv = $(".myouterdiv"); myouterdiv(".myinnerdiv") doesn't seem to work. How can i do this?
[04:14:33] <_ramo> could it be, that maybe the button isn't loaded?
[04:14:36] <Cork> codemagician: that way it adds the responce to the dialog before its shown
[04:14:45] <codemagician> Cork, when the user clicks the "set the URL" button I will need to make an AJAX call and at this point I will need the idProperty
[04:15:18] <Cork> codemagician: then ya, adding it as asosiated to the dialog is the simplest way
[04:15:30] <codemagician> Cork, also I need to make an AJAX GET call to pre-populate the form
[04:15:33] <Cork> codemagician: you can add it to the global scope if you prefer
[04:15:43] <codemagician> Cork, I was trying to avoid using global scope
[04:15:48] <Cork> codemagician: thats what i did up there
[04:16:00] <Cork> codemagician: ya, and thats what you do with the .data
[04:16:14] <codemagician> Cork, but .data stores things inside the DOM right?
[04:16:15] <Cork> codemagician: it doesn't really add to the dom, it just uses the doms id as an index
[04:16:18] <Cork> no
[04:16:24] <Cork> it assosiates it with the dom
[04:16:30] <codemagician> I see
[04:16:30] <ravenzz> _ramo i don't know, btw you should put that code within the ready() function, jQuery(document).ready(function() { /* thecode */ });
[04:16:37] <pickels> If a ajax request causes a 500 error what is the best way to handle these? Do I catch the error on the server and raise my own 500 error with a more useful message that can be passed to ajaxError or are there other techniques that are better?
[04:16:52] <codemagician> Cork, but that seems like another way of batting it around in the global namespace
[04:16:54] <_ramo> ravenzz: i'll try it
[04:17:15] <Cork> codemagician: not really as you add it directly to the dialog, and that is your scope
[04:17:16] <codemagician> Cork, doesn't jquery have a way of passing through your own custom params
[04:17:36] <Cork> codemagician: jquery does it through scoping
[04:17:45] <_ramo> ravenzz: that's not workingn too... i'll give it one more try
[04:17:54] <codemagician> Cork, is there any tutorials on this?
[04:18:10] <Cork> codemagician: its normal js scop
[04:18:15] <Cork> ?g javascript scope
[04:18:16] <bot-t> Cork, Digital Web Magazine - Scope in JavaScript - http://64.13.255.16/articles/scope_in_javascript/
[04:18:21] <Fox``> does anyone know of a plugin that handles ajax form submissions do make creating them a bit quicker?
[04:19:13] <tbranyen> scope mouth wash
[04:20:00] <_ramo> can i check, if an element with an special id exists on a page? ravenzz?
[04:20:25] <Fox``> found one
[04:20:39] <ravenzz> _ramo sure
[04:20:58] <ravenzz> if ($('#yourElement').length)
[04:22:07] <codemagician> Cork, well using normal JS scope I would have to define idProperty outside the functions in the global space?
[04:22:15] <khurram> how to append, or insertAfter the third row of the table ?
[04:22:28] <SkiOne> Let me try and rephrase: Let's say I have 4 divs each with the same class, I click on the 2nd div I want to remove the next 2 or I click on the first div and remove the next 3. So I want to be able to remove all divs with a specified class after the one I have clicked. I see some functions like after() and next() but I am not sure how to implement themany suggestions?
[04:22:32] <_ramo> hm, ravenzz if i do a alert(jQuery('#submitQueryBtn').length); in the ready function i get a 0
[04:22:41] <MorpheusXnl> Aamir, http://jsfiddle.net/eSptj/1/
[04:22:51] <_ramo> i've put the js file at the end of </body>, so it is loaded at last
[04:22:55] <_ramo> least
[04:23:09] <_ramo> last :)
[04:23:23] <_ramo> what could be the reason?
[04:23:41] <khurram> how to insert after the third row of the table ?
[04:24:13] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  it is http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/eSptj/2/
[04:24:15] <SkiOne> are siblings() only after or before too?
[04:24:38] <Aamir> khurram:  table.find('tr:eq(2)').after
[04:24:47] <ravenzz> _ramo 0 means that it doesn't exists
[04:24:47] <MorpheusXnl> Aamir, what do you mean i use this for the first time
[04:24:56] <shaggy_> Anyone?
[04:25:00] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl: click the button
[04:25:03] <khurram> thanks Aamir
[04:25:05] <Aamir> on the link i sent
[04:25:41] <_ramo> ravenzz: yeah, but i see it on the site. if i open the browsers source code, i can't search e.g. the string query-form,, but if i open "generated browser code" throught web developer of firefox, i can search for it
[04:26:03] <MorpheusXnl> yeah why doesn't it accept slow
[04:26:05] <SkiOne> shaggy_:  are you adding the blocks dynamically?
[04:26:19] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl: it does but its too fast for u to see :P
[04:26:40] <shaggy_> SkiOne: they're coming from a MySQL query (so yes)
[04:26:49] <MorpheusXnl> which option is better to use. the first one or the second one in your opinion
[04:26:54] <ravenzz> _ramo have you multiple elements with the same ID ?
[04:27:01] <_ramo> ravenzz: no, just that one
[04:27:05] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  chekc
[04:27:06] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/eSptj/3/
[04:27:16] <_ramo> could it be, that the searchbar and the button is loaded via javascript dynamically?
[04:27:22] <SkiOne> I am not sure based on your question but if you are trying to post form elements that have been adding after the page loads you may have to use livequery
[04:27:35] <_ramo> and so i can't get the length of the elements ?

[04:28:55] <SkiOne> shaggy_:  let me see your code
[04:29:18] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl: u can see my name in the fiddle examples i pasted above :P
[04:29:47] <MorpheusXnl> yes so i should create an account to for the future
[04:30:01] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  sure :)
[04:30:02] <beasty> i'm on a boat!
[04:30:13] <MorpheusXnl> thanks Aamir for your explanation
[04:30:22] <Aamir> MorpheusXnl:  you welcome
[04:30:24] <Trisox[work]> i'm having my foot up your ..
[04:30:25] <shaggy_> SkiOne: pastebin?
[04:30:31] <shaggy_> or url?
[04:30:35] <Trisox[work]> jsfiddle pastebin sucks
[04:30:41] <SkiOne> pastebin
[04:31:20] <Aamir> ?p
[04:31:20] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[04:31:27] <Aamir> i like dpaste.org
[04:31:37] <SkiOne> I like pastebin
[04:31:55] <SkiOne> whats the dif really?
[04:32:31] <shaggy_> Right well SkiOne I should probably explain that it uses a whole bunch of includes and a class to load the page
[04:32:46] <SkiOne> lets try and understand the problem better first
[04:32:56] <SkiOne> shaggy_:  so you have a page of friend requests
[04:33:07] <SkiOne> you click accept, it hides the request right so far?
[04:33:14] <shaggy_> yes (http://paysnork.com/friends.php)
[04:33:39] <shaggy_> SkiOne: It's not at that stage yet. I can't get it to hide the right ones
[04:34:04] <SkiOne> $(this).hide()
[04:34:12] <SkiOne> or something like that
[04:34:25] <Juzzy-> can I have multiple $(document).ready(function() { ? or should everyhting be under just 1 ready() ?
[04:34:37] <shaggy_> I tried that but the .click is based of the input button which has a class tag in it
[04:34:39] <SkiOne> I would put it all in one doc.ready section
[04:35:06] <SkiOne> you can get the id of the parent div (assuming the each friend request has a unique id)
[04:35:21] <Juzzy-> I really would like to move my different ajaxes out to their own .js file and include them as I need to, but I cant if they all need to be under one ready()
[04:36:24] <SkiOne> sorry juzzy I mixed up my convos. You can use external scripts with multiple doc.ready
[04:36:42] <Juzzy-> ah ok, thank helps then
[04:36:45] <Juzzy-> thx
[04:37:05] <shaggy_> Every friend request does have a unique ID. (It's displayed with a table) So what I was thinking is going <tr id="idnumber">, which should work perfectly but how do I include a variable within the $("___").hide();
[04:37:06] <SkiOne> now can anyone tell me how to get the id of all divs in the same class after the current div that has been clicked?
[04:37:31] <_ramo> can i delay the load of a script?
[04:38:22] <SkiOne> shaggy_: use a custom tag on the button like <input type=button parent=idofparent....  $('#'.$(this).attr('parent')).hide()
[04:38:52] <SkiOne> _ramo: perhaps but it would be better to make it event driven
[04:38:55] <tbranyen> shaggy_: use data-attr for that
[04:39:10] * SkiOne afk for 5
[04:41:33] <Pasti> hmm, is there some magic trick to using the filter(), .html() returns <h1> tags for a variable, but filter("h1") doesn't return the h1 tags..?
[04:43:34] <ravenzz> filter() "Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test."
[04:44:07] <markj> http://jsfiddle.net/Tbdpa/1/ @ Pasti
[04:44:11] <markj> seems to work fine?
[04:45:16] <Brammm> Has anybody got some experience with the jquery ui autocomplete plugin?
[04:45:16] <markj> maybe paste an example of your code on jsfiddle so we can see exactly what you're doing Pasti
[04:45:34] <Pasti> markj: see the paste, i updated it
[04:46:26] <markj> yeah you're not using it correctly, what are you actually wanting bar to be?
[04:46:35] <Pasti> 1 ?:)
[04:46:40] <markj> yes but what element
[04:46:42] <Pasti> iframe
[04:46:42] <markj> the iframe?
[04:46:54] <Brammm> I'm trying to append the found items to another list, it works by overwriting _renderItem but brings new problems, would I be better off using the default list, but styling it the way I want?
[04:49:21] <markj> without your markup this is a little silly :) what exactly are you trying to do, as there are loads of ways to get that iframe
[04:52:03] <lisak> $.ajax doesn't seem send xhr2 request with file, unless FormData is used
[04:52:10] <Pasti> markj: well, "if there is an element in the specific do not add it" : http://jsfiddle.net/Tbdpa/5/
[04:52:13] <lisak> seem to be able*
[04:52:23] <Pasti> markj: specific div that is.
[04:52:42] <blackspotwiggins> lisak, how else would you do it ?
[04:52:47] <blackspotwiggins> without formdata
[04:52:53] <lisak> xhr.send(file);
[04:53:17] <lisak> I created a question http://stackoverflow.com/q/6107835/306488
[04:54:24] <blackspotwiggins> xhr.send(file) has better support?
[04:54:33] <blackspotwiggins> iirc you have to use sendasbinary or similar
[04:54:50] <blackspotwiggins> which means it's easier to use native xhr than $.ajax
[04:55:23] <lisak> $.ajax(opt) calls xhr.send under the hood
[04:55:42] <lisak> but it works only when it resolve to xhr.send(formData);  not xhr.send(file);
[04:55:44] <markj> Pasti you want to use .children() to see if it has an element inside it
[04:56:08] <blackspotwiggins> yeah that's possible..
[04:56:09] <lisak> if I set option so that it executes xhr.send(file); it fails
[04:56:18] <blackspotwiggins> i'm using native xhr for that purpose
[04:56:28] <lisak> but I need Promise back
[04:59:41] <Whirl3d> Good Morning again...Anybody know how to tell the maximum scroll distance of a scrollable div?
[05:03:29] <khurram> how can i have some effect on this line $(".myTable").find('tr:eq(1)').after(data).show(1000);  it doesnt apply the show efffect
[05:03:29] <seutje> Whirl3d: the height of its contents?
[05:03:40] <NetRoY1> Whirl3d: node.scrollHeight ???
[05:04:07] <seutje> ooh, multiple punctuation marks, neat
[05:04:22] <seutje> isn't scrollHeight its currect scroll height ?????????????????????????????
[05:04:59] <Aamir> how to quickly .reverse() the jquery collection say jQuery('li')
[05:05:51] <seutje> it's an array, so can't u just reverse it?
[05:06:02] <Pasti> markj: thanks alot, worked like a charm :)
[05:06:13] <khurram> how can i show some effect when i add a new row into the table using $(".myTable").find('tr:eq(1)').after(data).show(1000);
[05:06:16] <SkiOne> sorry to bump: how do I get the ID of a div with a specified class after the current one?
[05:06:35] <Aamir> seutje:  http://gyazo.com/ac3cca704cc33fab312b457989ac72bb.png
[05:06:53] <khurram> Aamir: ?
[05:06:58] <Aamir> let me try this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-reverse-a-collection-of-jquery-elements
[05:07:44] <Aamir> jQuery('li') returns e.g    jQuery( li.first, li.last ) and i want jQuery( li.last, li.first )
[05:08:34] <Aamir> $.fn.reverse = [].reverse; did the magic :)
[05:08:41] <Whirl3d> SkiOne $(class).eq(2).attr('id');
[05:09:02] <seutje> neat
[05:09:10] <osmosis_paul> Please one doubt somebody can tell me why in that call i recieve in my controller the second parameter publishLocation as null ?????  http://pastecode.org/index.php/view/43870429
[05:09:12] <Whirl3d> SkiOne, * might be eq(1)....can't remember if it's 0 based or not.
[05:09:54] <SkiOne> eq()? ok I will look that up
[05:11:01] <seutje> qe is 0 indexin I believe
[05:11:06] <seutje> eq*
[05:12:43] <seutje> osmosis_paul: ur sending it as a string ??????????????????????????????????????????????
[05:15:30] <osmosis_paul> sep
[05:15:56] <osmosis_paul> seutje, yes this variable should be the value of the checkbox and yes like a string
[05:16:16] <Brammm> Anybody ever changed the jquery ui autocomplete menu?
[05:16:18] <osmosis_paul> i dont know how match this variable inside this jquery sentence
[05:16:42] <osmosis_paul> but if i put directly a "String" inside the query with double quotes send it correctly
[05:16:53] <osmosis_paul> but of course i need to send the variable value
[05:21:13] <SkiOne> observe the secsayness: $(this).parent().nextAll().hide();
[05:21:41] <shaggy_> SkiOne: ahhh alright, thanks!
[05:23:29] <SkiOne> actually that wasn't for you it was my problem but there is stuff there that could help you as well, you and I are doing similiar things
[05:24:13] <SkiOne> for you I would remove the nexAll() and put each friend request into a div (as opposed to a table) and then you should be set
[05:24:34] <SkiOne> this would hide all the friend requests after the current
[05:26:01] <seutje> osmosis_paul: ur sending the variable name as a string
[05:26:14] <seutje> ?eval var foo = 'bar'; "foo"
[05:26:27] * seutje bitchslaps bot-t
[05:26:47] <osmosis_paul> seutje, what do you mean?
[05:27:27] <osmosis_paul> seutje, if i use like this '@{Destinations.publishDestination(currentDestination?.id, publishLocation)}';
[05:27:36] <osmosis_paul> publishLocation arrive as nul
[05:27:38] <osmosis_paul> null
[05:27:47] <bot-t> seutje: "foo"
[05:27:50] <ohcibi> when an event is defaultPrevented, how can i trigger the default behaviour under certain circumstances?
[05:28:32] <seutje> osmosis_paul: I give up, gl&hf
[05:30:46] <osmosis_paul> seutje, i know what you mean, but if i dont put the quotes in the ${variable} i recieve that error  "The template /app/views/Destinations/select_form.html does not compile : unexpected token: ) "
[05:31:38] <osmosis_paul> seutje, the question is simple, how can i put a variable inside that jquey call?
[05:33:59] <silverdiamond_> afternoon guys, how would you go about filtering through a json object and match values based on a string, using jquery (....please :))
[05:34:27] <seutje> osmosis_paul: what jquery call?
[05:35:08] <seutje> silverdiamond_: parse & treat like any other object? o.O
[05:35:22] <osmosis_paul> seutje, ajax call i mean "var url = '@{Destinations.publishDestination(currentDestination?.id, ${publishLocation})}'"
[05:36:02] <seutje> that's an ajax call? looks like a string being assigned to a variable
[05:36:33] <seutje> after u do that, print the variable somewhere
[05:36:44] <silverdiamond_> seutje: I've never really done that before, newbie here :-\ any chance you can point me to an article with an example so I can play around and learn some more (thanks for responding btw)
[05:36:49] <seutje> and tell me if it literally says publishLocation
[05:37:11] <seutje> ?g parseJSON @ silverdiamond_
[05:37:28] <bot-t> seutje, No results found for 'parseJSON'.
[05:37:34] <seutje> WAT?
[05:38:11] <seutje> ?parseJSON @ silverdiamond_
[05:38:12] <bot-t> silverdiamond_, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:38:53] <silverdiamond_> seutje, wonderful, thanks for that :)
[05:39:50] <redeeman> $(this).closest("form").find("input[type=checkbox]").attr( "checked", true ); <-- shouldnt this work?
[05:42:17] <sodapop> in an accordion i get the selected item by $(this).find('.ui-state-active') how can i select the <div>after so i can alter the content of the selected
[05:43:44] <sodapop> html is <h3><a href="#">accordion 1</a></h3><div>content</div>
[05:44:17] <tdignan> Is there a jQuery plug-in that can take each div on my page and iterate through them? Showing the current div only?
[05:44:21] <djQuery> redeeman: $(this).closest('form').find('input:checkbox').prop('checked', true);
[05:45:17] <seutje> tdignan: like $('div').each(function(){ /*do shit to this*/ }) ?
[05:45:43] <seutje> and what do u mean by "showing the current div only"
[05:46:10] <seutje> if ur iterating over all of them, at the end of the loop, every div has been the "current", no?
[05:46:24] <djQuery> sodapop: see .next
[05:46:34] <albacker> seutje, i think he wants to show "one div at a time"
[05:46:39] <djQuery> >next
[05:46:49] <djQuery> ?.next
[05:46:53] <djQuery> too earlie
[05:47:30] <tdignan> seutje: kind of.. it will keep a list and the user will press a button
[05:47:36] <tdignan> each of the divs is a page in a book
[05:47:42] <tdignan> that the user will flip through
[05:47:47] <djQuery> redeeman: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[05:48:24] <redeeman> djQuery, thanks
[05:49:17] <redeeman> djQuery, it did however, still not work.
[05:49:33] <seutje> tdignan: something like $('div').hide().eq(0).fadeIn(function(){$(this).fadeOut().next().fadeIn(); });
[05:49:44] <djQuery> redeeman: see ?sjfiddle?
[05:49:53] <djQuery> ?jsfiddle
[05:50:33] <Whirl3d> Preferred easing plugin for jQuery?
[05:50:52] <jeffsmykil> Is there a reason why the source code from "View Source" and the source from firebug's "HTML" would be different?
[05:51:26] <seutje> tdignan: made a booboo, try http://jsfiddle.net/v9qRd/
[05:51:44] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, could it be the difference between the generated source and the original source?
[05:52:02] <jeffsmykil> must be
[05:52:17] <jeffsmykil> which should i target Whirl3d with javascript
[05:52:43] <sodapop> djQuery: so like $(this).find('.ui-state-active').next('div').html(... ?
[05:53:07] <tdignan> seutje: thanks
[05:53:13] <tdignan> that will give me a much easier start
[05:53:15] <anissaa> didi anyone see this error befor?==>uncaught exception: Neither data nor ajax settings supplied.
[05:53:16] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, what are you wanting to do?
[05:53:24] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: Im dealing with these horrible ASP generated tabs
[05:54:13] <jeffsmykil> in the original source they have more classes
[05:54:14] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, then you probably have to use the generated html. The source files may not be populated with the tab data if it's being generated dynamically
[05:54:15] <redeeman> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/6hU2e/
[05:54:32] <djQuery> sodapop: does it add anything to the div? so can you do $('parrent').find('div.ui-accordion.ui-content:visible')
[05:54:45] <jeffsmykil> Whirl3d: the issue is instead of styling the <li> they style the <a>
[05:55:05] <jeffsmykil> so im trying to figure out how i can target the next <a> after the <a> with selected
[05:56:38] <Ari-Ugwu> 'the next <a> after the <a> with selected'?!
[05:56:40] <jeffsmykil> its easy to do when the <li> is the thing be styled
[05:56:51] <Whirl3d> jeffsmykil, find  a common ancestor and use closest to grab it, then find the next one with find
[05:56:56] <jeffsmykil> the next <a> after the a.selected
[05:57:04] <djQuery> redeeman: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/c8sEX/
[05:57:27] <jeffsmykil> the common ancestor Whirl3d is the UL
[05:57:48] <redeeman> djQuery, hmm i didnt know about input:checkbox i thought : was for other stuff such as :invalid etc
[05:57:57] <Ari-Ugwu> Why doesn't this do it? $('a.selected').parent('li').next('li').children('a:first')
[05:58:02] <jeffsmykil> im not sure how that woudld help me find the LI after li.selected
[05:58:18] <jeffsmykil> i can try that
[05:58:23] <jeffsmykil> i had something similar
[05:58:27] <jeffsmykil> but not quite that
[05:59:09] <djQuery> redeeman: there are a couple different psuedo selectors that come with it. and you can make ur own. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Sxz7T/
[05:59:50] <jeffsmykil> Ari-Ugwu: as soon as my machine stops auto-saving the virtual machine
[05:59:53] <djQuery> redeeman: also you are not using valid html markup
[06:00:05] <djQuery> a form cannot be nested in a table
[06:01:01] <redeeman> djQuery, yeah i kinda know that, im working around crappy stylesheets provided by someone else
[06:01:32] <Ari-Ugwu> jeffsmykil, that code assumes a setup like this. <li><a class='selected'>foo</a></li><li><a>bar</a></li>
[06:01:33] <redeeman> djQuery, would that prevent jquery from working though?
[06:01:38] <redeeman> djQuery, since your code also fails for me :|
[06:01:42] <tdignan> why wouldn't you fix it at the stylesheet layer?
[06:02:06] <redeeman> i do not have control over that :|
[06:02:19] <tdignan> you can't stick a <style> tag in your html file?
[06:02:21] <jeffsmykil> Ari-Ugwu: yeah thats it
[06:02:31] <tdignan> or a style= attribute in your div?
[06:02:40] <djQuery> redeeman: mine workd in the example I gave u
[06:02:57] <redeeman> djQuery, yeah i saw that, so could it be due to the broken html that it fails to work?
[06:02:59] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/c8sEX/
[06:02:59] <jeffsmykil> Ari-Ugwu: I had tried this
[06:03:06] <redeeman> tdignan, unfortunately some policies prevents me
[06:03:08] <jeffsmykil> var adjacent = $(".selected").parent().next().child();
[06:03:17] <seutje> jeffsmykil: the source u see in firebug is the processed source, after javascript and the likes have done their thing
[06:03:22] <djQuery> redeeman: try fixin this one <inputÂ type="checkbox"Â name="prod[1]"value="true">VÃ¦lg</input>
[06:03:26] <Ari-Ugwu> jeffsmykil, and?
[06:03:42] <jeffsmykil> not specific enough im going to try yours
[06:03:47] <seutje> there's no child method
[06:04:04] <djQuery> redeeman: the only checkbox you are selectin has bad code is the issue I think
[06:04:19] <redeeman> djQuery, oh that only happened when i pasted to jsfiddle, it is correct in real one
[06:04:20] <Whirl3d> and there's no shared li
[06:04:43] <jeffsmykil> seutje: yeah children but no child
[06:06:00] <Whirl3d> $("a").index($("a:selected").index()+1);  lol
[06:06:06] <khurram> hi all
[06:06:15] <khurram> is there any way to reduce this  $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().css(         {"border":"2px solid blue","color":"blue"});
[06:06:36] <Whirl3d> ?closest @ khurram

[06:07:15] <khurram> Whirl3d:  what syntax   $(this).closest.parent() ?
[06:07:29] <khurram> thanks
[06:08:13] <Whirl3d> khurram, find something selectable about the item and use $(this).closest(".specialclassorsomething").css...
[06:08:37] <jeffsmykil> yeah Ari-Ugwu got it working with your code, thanks
[06:08:51] <Ari-Ugwu> jeffsmykil, np
[06:09:02] <djQuery> redeeman: once I fix the html it basicaly works http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6hU2e/1/
[06:09:08] <seutje> khurram: closest is a method, not a property
[06:10:49] <khurram> thanks i did it works great now i want to remove the border attribute if it is already present ?
[06:11:42] <seutje> ?removeattr @ khurram

[06:12:11] <khurram> thanks
[06:12:28] <seutje> any more easily googlable things u need?
[06:12:54] <osmosis_paul> seutje, hi, sorry i was in a meeting, i put the value of the checkbox into a variable "publishLocation = $("#production").attr('value');"
[06:13:34] <osmosis_paul> seutje,  and then i want to put in the ajax call "'@{Destinations.publishDestination(currentDestination?.id, publishLocation)}'; "
[06:13:46] <osmosis_paul> but in my java class recieve null in that parameter
[06:13:57] <seutje> ur use of quotes troubles me
[06:15:56] <_ramo> what does this codesnippet mean: jQuery(SOLR.app) ? what exaclty is SOLR.app doing?
[06:16:03] <_ramo> has anyobdy an idea?
[06:17:05] <Peeter> _ramo: might be a selector?
[06:17:19] <Peeter> jQuery(SOLR.app) is the same as $(SOLR.app)
[06:18:06] <_ramo> Peeter: yeah, that's clear... i just mean what is SOLR.app, is it a namespace?
[06:19:39] <seutje> smells like it
[06:21:00] <khurram> how can i find a table whose border is set ?
[06:21:44] <khurram> $('#myTable').find('.childtable').hasAttribute("") ?
[06:21:56] <seutje> by attribute?
[06:22:04] <seutje> $('table[border]')
[06:23:33] <khurram> $('#myTable').find('.childtable').attr("border")  cuz it has an css border not the html table border ?
[06:23:44] <anli_> window.open has started to return null for me :)
[06:23:47] <anli_> Strange thing
[06:23:56] <anli_> Is there a jquery way of doing a popup?
[06:24:19] <_foobar> the hole point for me to use a library like jQuery is so there wont be a different result in different browsers.. I get different result trough this lines though: http://pastebin.com/4dV1WH4k
[06:24:19] <_foobar> To know in the problem is that there is images in the li-elements that have display:block style on them!
[06:24:45] <anli_> ah, it was the popup blocker of course
[06:25:06] <_foobar> I get 150 in ff and opera but 169 in chrome
[06:25:45] * _foobar begging for help
[06:26:37] <Ari-Ugwu> khurram, just grab the attribute and check it's length?
[06:26:41] <Ari-Ugwu> '' = not set
[06:27:16] <khurram> but i want the style='border:....' property not the <table border=1   ?
[06:28:03] <albacker> i have function foo(username) { $.post("some/url/here", {'username':username}, function(data) { alert("the username="+username); }); }  and the alert displays undefined.. like username is not known in the callback. is thi normal behaviour?
[06:28:12] <khurram>  $("myTable").find(".innerTable").attr("border","none"); this doesn't work for me
[06:28:21] <Ari-Ugwu> khurram, var booya = ($('.foo').css('border').length > 0)? "This thing has a border!" : "No border :(";
[06:30:07] <khurram> how to check all the inner Table attributes. ?
[06:30:41] <khurram> if the parent table have 10 innerTables i want to see if any of the innerTable has style=border: some thing   SET if it is then remove it
[06:30:45] <seutje> fucking 20 secs after I showed u the removeAttr method, rly?
[06:30:57] <Ari-Ugwu> I would redesign anything with 10 inner tables.
[06:31:09] <seutje> wtf r u doing?
[06:31:15] <khurram> sorry champ
[06:31:16] <seutje> nested tables, inline style, ...
[06:31:20] <seutje> I'ma step away now
[06:31:23] <Ari-Ugwu> hahaha
[06:31:24] <khurram> nested tables
[06:31:26] <seutje> before I throw up
[06:31:54] <khurram> i already tried what you pasted before
[06:31:56] <Jester831> ok, who can tell me why these phase differently? http://adams-center.dynamic-press.com/test3 and http://adams-center.dynamic-press.com/
[06:32:46] <wkmanire> Good mourning
[06:33:21] <khurram> all i need to know how to use the syntax for ('#myTable').loopthorugh all the innertables and check if any has style=border:1px then unset that inner table style border : none
[06:33:31] <Ari-Ugwu> khurram, $('.innerTable').each(function() { //check for border or whatever });
[06:33:43] <khurram> ah i c
[06:33:44] <khurram> thanks
[06:33:50] <khurram> .each u c
[06:34:03] <Ari-Ugwu> or just ('.innertable').css('border', 'none');
[06:34:27] <Ari-Ugwu> If all you want to do is remove all the borders from elements with that class.
[06:34:51] <wkmanire> $('#myTable table').each(function() { if ($(this).css('border') === '1px') { $(this).css('border', 'none'); } });
[06:34:54] <wkmanire> perhaps something like that
[06:35:01] <wkmanire> but I think "inner table" is a dirty word.
[06:35:05] <wkmanire> word(s)
[06:35:18] <_ramo> why is this http://jsfiddle.net/fthuT/ alerting an undefined, but the check if the type of SOLR.app is undefined is false?
[06:36:09] <_ramo> does anyone has an idea?
[06:36:39] <wkmanire> _ramo: http://jsfiddle.net/fthuT/1/
[06:37:42] <sandwiches> wkmanire: I'd rather use .toggleClass than that logic personally
[06:37:46] <CIDIC> can anyone suggest a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/cjSHS2uh it feels like I'm doing something wrong
[06:37:51] <CIDIC> it works.
[06:38:02] <khurram> ok here i am http://jsfiddle.net/Xav3g/
[06:38:19] <wkmanire> sandwiches: We shouldn't be adjusting borders with jQuery unless we're animating something
[06:38:21] <wkmanire> but that is my opinion.
[06:38:33] <_ramo> wkmanire: again... SOLR.app is a fucntion in another JS file. if i test if(typeof SOLR === 'undefined') that is false... i get the alert message with an "undefined" message
[06:39:27] <sandwiches> wkmanire: we should be applying style hints to the renderer though.  the "borders" part of the discussion isn't javascript's job, agreed.
[06:39:38] <khurram> wkmanire: love u champ
[06:40:02] <wkmanire> _ramo: So SOLR is defined and SOLR.app is not?
[06:40:17] <matt1982> hey, is there a way to
[06:40:20] <matt1982> oops
[06:40:23] <seutje> ?tias
[06:40:24] <bot-t> Try It And See
[06:40:29] <_ramo> wkmanire: var SOLR = {}; SOLR.app = function() { ... both are defined
[06:40:30] <wkmanire> he he
[06:40:42] <_ramo> but in another js file
[06:41:10] <matt1982> hey, is there a way to make a datepicker input field show the selector when clicked on but not be editable by the user?
[06:41:52] <wkmanire> _ramo: I see, can you add that js file as a resource to this fiddle?
[06:42:14] <_ramo> wkmanire: i can try
[06:42:47] <seutje> matt1982: try readonly attr
[06:44:16] <wkmanire> matt1982: Did that work?
[06:44:16] <CIDIC> can anyone suggest a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/cjSHS2uh it feels like I'm doing something wrong
[06:44:46] <jeffsmykil> is there something like em,pty that removes the element as well as the content?
[06:45:10] <wkmanire> $.remove() should do that.
[06:45:23] <jeffsmykil> ty
[06:45:23] <wkmanire> CIDIC: I don't see anything expressly wrong with that. What are you going for?
[06:45:38] <matt1982> seutje, sorry phone went will try now. Totally didnt think of that.
[06:45:38] <seutje> ?Eval $.remove();
[06:45:40] <bot-t> seutje: TypeError: $.remove is not a function
[06:45:42] <seutje> :)
[06:45:49] <b3ngt> Hi, can I check if a div is assigned something during bind();? I have firebug active.
[06:46:08] <khurram>  var name = "#td_name_"+id;       var xx = $(this).closest("table").find(name).html();       alert(xx); prints null ?
[06:46:28] <wkmanire> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[06:46:40] <matt1982> seutje, nice! many thanks.
[06:46:44] <khurram> i want the contents of this td ?
[06:46:48] <CIDIC> wkmanire it doesn't seem to work relyably
[06:47:39] <seutje> khurram: it's an ID, why are u making things so hard? $(name).html() should do
[06:47:40] <mazzachre> How do I make an input field do an ajax call every time someone types in it?
[06:47:41] <wkmanire> CIDIC: How are you using it? That jQuery function is not going to run until the DOM is ready.
[06:47:52] <seutje> mazzachre: keyup
[06:47:57] <CIDIC> hum
[06:48:05] <khurram> seutje: thanks but it is returning me null
[06:48:10] <seutje> remember to asplode the xhr object on additional calls
[06:48:11] <CIDIC> I'm using it as an object that I create instances of
[06:48:16] <wkmanire> So if you call that function and then immediately try to use it before the DOM loads then it won't work.
[06:48:18] <seutje> khurram: does the object exist?
[06:48:22] <khurram> yes
[06:48:27] <seutje> khurram: what does $(name).length return?
[06:48:30] <wkmanire> Are you trying to create a widget type pattern?
[06:48:37] <CIDIC> wkmanire what can I do then?
[06:48:42] <khurram> it was the innerTable i got from jquery now i want its contents
[06:49:03] <CIDIC> wkmanire kind of, my app doesn't really use much jquery. I suppose I could use getelementbyid I'm not sure how the timing for that works though
[06:49:10] <emilkarl> Is it possible to retrieve a full class name if I know half of it? Ex class='foo bar foo-bar-1' I would like to select all $(".foo") and then see what the foo-bar-* class is?
[06:49:30] <wkmanire> CIDIC: If you have jQuery being loaded then you should use it as much as possible. It isn't a small input :)
[06:49:32] <CIDIC> emilkarl sounds like that would be super slow
[06:49:33] <wkmanire> include*
[06:49:33] <wkmanire> rather
[06:49:41] <sodapop> thanks for helping
[06:49:46] <emilkarl> hmm maybe
[06:49:51] <seutje> emilkarl: considedr using data attributes
[06:49:54] <wkmanire> CIDIC: Do you have jQuery-UI in the page?
[06:50:01] <CIDIC> wkmanire no
[06:50:05] <CIDIC> just jquery
[06:50:30] <CIDIC> I basically need it to set the element it is bound to on object creation
[06:50:47] <wkmanire> Ok, well you might want to consider following the plugin pattern. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[06:50:48] <CIDIC> I haven't been able to find a good example of that anywhere
[06:51:08] <CIDIC> wkmanire I don't want to make it a jquery plugin
[06:51:10] <emilkarl> seutje: just set my own attributes or what do you mean?
[06:51:12] <wkmanire> You can also check out microjs.com
[06:51:22] <wkmanire> There are a lot of tiny OOP libraries on there that can help you.
[06:51:47] <wkmanire> The thing is, if you want to bind an object to an element, you're going to have to wait until the DOM loads to instantiate instances.
[06:52:15] <wkmanire> Or you're going to have to create the DOM on the fly as you are instantiating those instances and then attach those elements to the body after it is ready.
[06:52:28] <wkmanire> Which would be really messy
[06:53:00] <daggo218> hey
[06:53:09] <seutje> emilkarl: yea, instead of setting that as a class, set it as data-foo or some shit
[06:53:22] <wkmanire> CIDIC: underscore.js has a neat method called bind, that would let you for instance bind a function (object) to an element.
[06:53:31] <wkmanire> which will cause 'this' to always point to the element.
[06:53:43] <emilkarl> seutje: isnt that ugly :P just come up with my own attributes... :P
[06:53:45] <Kambfhase> wkmanire: jQ has that too
[06:53:57] <daggo218> do you know if there's a way to directly trigger the calendar on onClick="datepicker()"
[06:54:06] <seutje> emilkarl: dumping a crapton of data in the class attribute is better?
[06:54:12] <geestring> hey wkmanire, Im' still trying to figure out my javascript and local xml file thing. If I have two computers on the same local network and they both want access to an xml file, we said that we needed a local webserver. If i install a webserver on one of the computers, can http://localhost be made available to other computers on the network?
[06:54:14] <wkmanire> Kambfhase: Really? I didn't know that. Are you sure you're not talking about $.bind() for event handling?
[06:54:16] <seutje> daggo218: trigger a click :D
[06:54:20] <emilkarl> dunno :)
[06:54:20] <daggo218> I've tried pretty much every permutation to try to get the thing to trigger,
[06:54:21] <b3ngt> I try to determine if my .bind() gets through to my div. How can I control that it does?
[06:54:26] <emilkarl> just asking
[06:54:31] <Kambfhase> ?$.proxy @ wkmanire
[06:54:32] <bot-t> wkmanire, jQuery.proxy() - Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular scope. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[06:54:34] <emilkarl> attirbutes would be easier
[06:54:34] <seutje> $('[onClick]').trigger('click'); hueheuheuheuheuhe >:|
[06:54:42] <daggo218> hahaha
[06:54:43] <wkmanire> Kambfhase: Sweet! Thank you. :)
[06:55:01] <Kambfhase> :)
[06:55:20] <seutje> b3ngt: WAT?
[06:55:46] <daggo218> seriously though, I can get to the element with $.live
[06:55:50] <wkmanire> geestring: No and that also doesn't make any sense.
[06:55:54] <daggo218> add a click trigger
[06:56:08] <wkmanire> geestring: localhost is usually defined in your hosts file and points at the loopback interface on your ethernet card.
[06:56:09] <daggo218> but when I try $().datepicker, nothing
[06:56:18] <wkmanire> geestring: Which is commonly bound to 127.0.0.1
[06:56:19] <seutje> heh?
[06:56:20] <daggo218> alert('here') results in 'here' though
[06:56:34] <khurram> seutje: thanks it is working now..cheers :)
[06:56:34] <seutje> daggo218: as a property of an empty collection or what?
[06:56:35] <wkmanire> geestring: You should really go read about that on wikipedia :)
[06:56:45] <daggo218> nope
[06:56:47] * Kambfhase hacked 127.0.0.1
[06:56:57] <CIDIC> wkmanire thanks for the link, good stuff
[06:57:02] <b3ngt> seutje: I don't know if my bind() works since I suspect that something else if above that element right now - that would explain why clicking it does not work. So I want to know if it's a CSS-issue or not
[06:57:04] <wkmanire> CIDIC: welcome
[06:57:14] <CIDIC> wkmanire I can't believe I've never seen this
[06:57:27] <geestring> so basically if I want two computers to use the same local xml file... I can't ? :) Other than installing a webserver on each computer?
[06:57:30] <seutje> b3ngt: just console.log(this); in the handler
[06:57:37] <seutje> then click it, and see what it logs
[06:57:40] <daggo218> its from within a dialog, which loads another view via .load
[06:57:48] <b3ngt> seutje: tyty
[06:57:51] <wkmanire> geestring: They are windows machines correct?
[06:57:58] <geestring> yes
[06:58:00] <daggo218> so I'm using .live (I've tried alternatives as well)
[06:58:07] <wkmanire> Set up a network share on one of them and put that file in the share
[06:58:35] <seutje> daggo218: what did u expect from $().datepicker?
[06:58:45] <wkmanire> CIDIC: There has just been a javascript explosion in the last few years. There is so much quality code floating around out there now it is impossible to keep up.
[06:58:56] <daggo218> that wasn't the literal code
[06:59:15] <wkmanire> CIDIC: I subscribe to the Javascript Weekly, which is an e-mail that is issued on Fridays where the author tries to keep up with all of the major developments.
[06:59:17] <daggo218> $('#dp1306190915641').live('click', function(){
[06:59:17] <daggo218> 	
[06:59:17] <daggo218> 	$('#dp1306190915641').datepicker().click();
[06:59:17] <daggo218> })
[06:59:29] <seutje> erm lol
[06:59:30] <wkmanire> Its really good in my opinion. You might want to check that out too.
[06:59:47] <geestring> wkmanire, would that not work because of the same problem as before, which is the inability to use a local xml file?
[06:59:47] <daggo218> er
[06:59:57] <daggo218> ignore that click() at the end ;)
[07:00:10] <wkmanire> geestring: If you want to use javascript to get that XML into your page you need to set up a webserver.
[07:00:28] <wkmanire> Since you're using windows you're going to have at least IIS 5.1 available to you
[07:00:28] <toot> hey folks - wee query/confirmation: http://people.flamegreen.net/~chris/circle.jpg - is it possible to turn those boxes into link hotspots with mouseovers, etc without using an imagemap ? (i'm thinking not)
[07:00:36] <geestring> ok thanks. I guess it's not possible to have two computers looking at the same local webserver
[07:00:42] <_ramo> wkmanire: never mind.. it works now
[07:00:43] <wkmanire> geestring: it is.
[07:00:56] <seutje> daggo218: have u read the docs on datepicker?
[07:01:04] <_ramo> i've tested it on != "undefined" and it works now, like it should
[07:01:05] <daggo218> yes
[07:01:05] <wkmanire> k
[07:01:10] <daggo218> and it works elsewhere
[07:01:27] <seutje> u know ur rebinding the datepicker functionality on every click, right?
[07:01:44] <daggo218> yeah - I've tried it other ways
[07:01:47] <seutje> and it'll never open, coz the field doesn't get focus after the datepicker was initialized
[07:01:56] <daggo218> I just want to get an event to trigger in any way possible at this point
[07:02:04] <seutje> ?trigger
[07:02:04] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:02:22] <wkmanire> geestring: You need to set up an IIS site and then put that file on there and then figure out what the IP address is of the machine with the file on it.
[07:02:28] <daggo218> I tried binding after the .ajax post
[07:02:31] <wkmanire> then use jQuery $.ajax functions to get the data.
[07:02:38] <seutje> u prolly want to attach the datepicker behavior when the element is added to the page, not when the element is clicked
[07:02:42] <daggo218> which works in other cases, but this is after the 2nd .post()
[07:02:43] <jeffsmykil> im thinking of something similar to hasClass but actually exists
[07:03:12] <daggo218> still binds, alert('foo') is triggered correctly
[07:03:34] <jeffsmykil> wait hasClass exists
[07:04:11] <seutje> daggo218: NOWAI
[07:04:24] <seutje> gonna give this one last try
[07:04:36] <seutje> daggo218: calling datepicker on a collection DOES NOT OPEN THE DATEPICKER
[07:04:58] <seutje> it only attaches the functionality to that collection
[07:05:19] <daggo218> yeah - definitely
[07:05:33] <daggo218> but it's not attaching functionality to the datepicker
[07:05:42] <seutje> yea it is
[07:05:49] <seutje> it's just re-attaching it every time u click it
[07:05:57] <seutje> try focussing it withouth clicking it
[07:06:25] <cgcardona> good morning. I have a couple nested divs which I am iterating over with .each(). I am attempting to check if each element has a parent named chord and if so if it happens to be the last of it's siblings. However somethings not working. Any pointers? http://pastebin.com/hSsMSvF6
[07:07:08] <daggo218> clicking on the field doesn't trigger, focus doesn't trigger either o.O
[07:07:36] <wkmanire> Well, time to head into the office.
[07:07:39] <wkmanire> I'll be back later fellas.
[07:08:44] <devil2005> i saw in the ajax.load() function you are able to select a hook, only displaying the data you want in the response. e.g ajax.load('http://example.com #main-content') which will return the main content div. is there a way to do that but use POST instead of just GETting the page?
[07:09:11] <Phoenixz> Can jQuery / javascript also get the "real" image height? if an image is 2000px high, but shown scaled down to 800px, .css(height) will give me 800, and .height() will also give 800... Can I somehow get the real size of 2000?
[07:09:13] <Phoenixz> I have a very simple page, <div>some header texts</div><img>..  The header is about 2em large, and the image is scaled down in size, IF it is larger than the screen.. The image starts 2.5em from the top and ends .5em from the bottom, IF it is scaled.. If the image was scaled, when clicking on the image with the mouse, it should be shown in its full size.. Problem is, CSS won't cut it so I'll do it with jQuery and calculating width and height directly.
[07:09:14] <Phoenixz> .
[07:09:43] <Phoenixz> So in order to do that, I need current scaled size, and the real size, but I can't find how to get that value
[07:10:13] <blackspotwiggins> Phoenixz, remove scaling and get the size then
[07:10:24] <blackspotwiggins> probably the easiest way
[07:11:08] <b3ngt> My jQuery UI-slider wont slide. It works in a way, since my function that responds to when sliding is doing what it should. The only thing not happening is that the slider aint going nowhere. What could be the problem?
[07:11:10] <Phoenixz> blackspotwiggins: Just to be sure.. there is no way to do this with CSS?
[07:11:20] <blackspotwiggins> no
[07:11:21] <silverdiamond_> me again, does jquery have ability to partial match strings, like you would with .search / regex using javascript?
[07:11:46] <tman> what's up with fadeTo not working on png elements in ie ?
[07:12:08] <b3ngt> Silowyi: Take a look at the .filter()-function.

[07:12:57] <Michael> #zftalk is like the blackhole/twilight zone of IRC. Everyone in there is some kind of occult member
[07:13:21] <b3ngt> Michael: How so?
[07:13:40] <Michael> Someone made a foolish point. I disagreed and gave my reason, they responded by shooting a !tell Michael off_topic at me
[07:13:43] <Michael> I'm like "oooook"
[07:13:49] <maxmoore14> I can't seem to get a simple form to submit. Can someone help me out with this? http://jsfiddle.net/4XRtn/1/
[07:13:57] <maxmoore14> I'm sure I'm missing something stupid
[07:14:00] <silverdiamond_> b3ngt, thanks will have a look into it now
[07:14:15] <Michael> And that Bittarman guy is like the enforcer of his twisted ideals. If you say something he doesn't approve of, no matter how innocent of malevolent - he ops himself and kicks you
[07:14:16] <daggo218> arg - this really shouldn't be so complicated.  I just want to bind to the datepicker after the thing has finished loading DOM objects
[07:14:19] <Michael> anyway
[07:15:25] <daggo218> $.post( .... , funciton(data) { alert('here') }) - confirms that its loading at least after the data is there.  but binding to dom objects loaded in the result of the post - not happening
[07:15:54] <Michael> b3ngt, It's like before you ask a question - you had better make sure it is 100% associated with Zend Framework. Not PHP specific, zend framework specific. IF you're not sure and you ask - you get kicked
[07:16:13] <Michael> Thanks for your sympathetic reading lol
[07:17:05] <b3ngt> Michael: I disagree though. I've asked PHP-specific questions there several times, after getting an off-topic, just change channel and continue there since most of the regulars that would care to take such a discussion is there aswell.
[07:17:28] <Michael> b3ngt, Seems way over anal retentive to me
[07:17:39] <Michael> People ask JS questions in here and we're happy to answer unless it becomes a nuisence
[07:17:52] <Michael> nuisance
[07:18:08] <Michael> b3ngt, but like right there - you can't disagree with them. It's taken personal
[07:18:27] * Michael would help fund 'official' channels if it meant better support
[07:18:37] <b3ngt> Michael: It's a personal preference, some people like it that way - and if they're the owners of the channel and you'd like to stay there - ofcourse you follow the rules. Especially if on topic is sacred.
[07:19:05] <Michael> I dunno. I look at them as the same kind of people that go into rages in World of Warcraft
[07:19:09] <Michael> like "lighten up man"
[07:19:24] <Michael> It's PHP. It's not even a real language lol
[07:19:26] <Michael> Ok I'm done
[07:20:12] <_foobar> is there anyway for me to retrive style.top value?
[07:20:22] <Michael> What is style.top?
[07:20:31] <Michael> oh n/m
[07:21:12] <maxmoore14> can anyone see why this is not getting submitted? http://jsfiddle.net/4XRtn/1/
[07:21:14] <Michael> Just obj.style.top I thought
[07:21:25] <Michael> WHat does $(obj).css('top') return?
[07:21:50] <_foobar> Michael: let me check
[07:22:09] <muley> _foobar: check .position() and/or .offset()
[07:22:47] <muley> and php deserves more love <333
[07:23:21] <Michael> muley, I don't like how we use ZF and need support and the primary place to get it from is full of difficult people
[07:23:23] <_foobar> ty both.. Its a bit of a big code that hasent been tested yet .. so its gonna take some time to check.. but thanks for the help
[07:23:46] <Phoenixz> I have a screen height (for example) of 800px, but a header of 2em.. the image should be 800px-2em, how can I calculate these 2 different types of values??
[07:23:58] <muley> haha yea... difficult people are tough to deal with, but dont blame the language =]
[07:24:23] <_foobar> let me know if I can help with zf.. I know a bit
[07:26:59] <Michael> _foobar, thanks!
[07:32:55] <maxmoore14> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/4XRtn/1/
[07:35:05] <Whirl3d> if I select an h2 element and get the value for $("h2").first().position() ;   why does it change value when it's parent div is scrolled?
[07:35:51] <lisak> maxmoore14, form element doesn't have ending tag
[07:35:57] <lisak> </form>
[07:36:30] <lisak> <form  />  doesn't seem to be correct
[07:36:34] <maxmoore14> lisak: jquery creates the ending tag for you
[07:36:36] <AdvoWork> hi there, im trying to do: $('#maintable').append();   and in append() im doing: <tr><td></td><td></td>.... etc etc, theres about 20 tds, ended with a tr, but it keeps saying theres a syntax error. Any ideas please?
[07:36:38] <lisak> ok
[07:37:18] <seutje> ?paste @ AdvoWork
[07:37:18] <bot-t> AdvoWork, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[07:38:14] <AdvoWork> seutje, http://pastebin.com/59qUk48h
[07:39:45] <DoctorDarren> Is it possible to have a draggable's "revert" called by a button?
[07:39:53] <seutje> AdvoWork: linebreaks
[07:40:03] <Ari-Ugwu> maxmoore14, what, the....Are you trying to have jquery create a input and set the value?
[07:40:07] <DoctorDarren> E.g. a user drags a div around, lets go, and an "undo" button appears which reverts the div to its inital position
[07:40:17] <AdvoWork> seutje, ie on new lines?
[07:40:37] <MGT> hey, I have a question about parsing custom tags: http://jsfiddle.net/x55LD/      basically, I can read custom tags correctly except within a <select> tag
[07:40:58] <Tidwell> DoctorDarren: store the position of the div on drag start and reset it on button click?
[07:41:29] <seutje> AdvoWork: works fine without the linebreak http://jsbin.com/ocizu5/edit
[07:41:29] <Michael> http://thewrongsideof25.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mybad.jpg?w=630&h=470
[07:41:31] <MGT> (sorry, here's the correct link: http://jsfiddle.net/x55LD/1/ )
[07:41:38] <Ari-Ugwu> 'custom tags' always translated into 'just use a span' for me
[07:41:48] <seutje> DoctorDarren: how does one click a button whilst dragging something?
[07:41:48] <DoctorDarren> Tidwell: Yep, guess that makes sense thanks!
[07:41:59] <DoctorDarren> seutje: It's after they've dropped it
[07:42:14] <Michael> seutje, Drag with left, click right while dragging
[07:42:20] <DoctorDarren> ... or multi-touch screen
[07:42:44] <maxmoore14> Ari-Ugwu: I'm creating a datagrid widget and I want to have a button that exports the data as a csv file
[07:42:58] <fmari>  what's the better mobile with skype client and gps?
[07:43:03] <maxmoore14> so I'm creating a form on the fly, setting some hidden values and submitting it
[07:43:19] <maxmoore14> then the server side handler returns a .csv file
[07:43:54] <Ari-Ugwu> maxmoore14, Why aren't use just doing: .append('<input type="hidden" name="fileType"  value="csv" />')?
[07:45:47] <maxmoore14> good point, I'll change it to that - no good reason there
[07:45:59] <maxmoore14> doesn't change the fact that the form won't submit though
[07:46:54] <Phoenixz> Here is a pickle.. I have a browser window height (for example) 800px.. I have an image 2000px.. The browser window shows first a header of 2em, THEN the image scaled so that it shows fullscreen until .5em from the bottom.. When I click on the image, it should animate scale to its real size.. clicking again on it should scale it back to the browser window size.. There are many complicated problems here.. I can not say CSS img{max-height: 100%}
[07:46:56] <Phoenixz> because of the header (the image would make the page 2em too big.. If I use real pixels, I'll get in trouble the second the user either resizes the browser screen, or changes font size.. Is there not some basic solution for this stuff?
[07:47:15] <_foobar> how can I combine to jquery objects into one.. should I use extend?
[07:48:03] <matschaffer> _foobar: sounds like your best option
[07:48:24] <_foobar> matschaffer: ty..
[07:48:45] <phentges> Is there a way to determine if an object has an event binding (e.g., .click(function () {}) applied)?
[07:48:50] <Whirl3d> Phoenix, is the image bigger than the viewport?
[07:49:35] <Ari-Ugwu> maxmoore14, You want to create and send a form without it ever showing on the page?
[07:49:43] <maxmoore14> yes
[07:49:44] <Ari-Ugwu> maxmoore14, Why not just use $.ajax?
[07:50:16] <Ari-Ugwu> I would recommend using JSON and not CSV.
[07:50:20] <phentges> I want to do an "if (!eventBound)" before attaching an event to an object.
[07:51:16] <maxmoore14> because ajax returns the data to the ajax handlers (like success) - I want the browser to be prompted to save the file
[07:51:28] <matschaffer> phentges: there might be a better way, but at very least you could attach a data flag to the node
[07:51:37] <maxmoore14> Ari-Ugwu: http://jsfiddle.net/4XRtn/2/
[07:51:49] <seutje> phentges: I usually do something like $('.foo').not('.already-bound-to-this-shit').addClass('already-bound-to-this-shit').bind('event', fn); ?
[07:52:08] <quicksilver> phentges: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236067/test-if-event-handler-is-bound-to-an-element-in-jquery
[07:52:26] <TheWarden> I'm using JQuery UI and for some reason I can't figure out how to pass the value along with the ID. The value comes across fine but the id always comes as undefined even though the remote data is present.
[07:52:37] <TheWarden> See line #33 http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J Any suggestions??
[07:52:38] <_foobar> dont think it worked matschaffer
[07:52:41] <matschaffer> hehe, I was oddly close. Good link quicksilver
[07:52:53] <Ari-Ugwu> maxmoore14, I would imagine you need to append the form to the DOM before you can submit it.
[07:53:18] <Ely^> hi does any one nnow a very good lightbox plugin that supports: audio, video, external html; recgonizes vimeo and youtube, images, video / image galleries and so on ?
[07:53:27] <Ely^> i found CeeBox but that does not support audio ;s
[07:53:29] <phentges> Thanks quicksilver!
[07:55:37] <_foobar> matschaffer: n/m it did
[07:56:03] <matschaffer> _foobar: sweet!
[07:56:49] <TheWarden> I can't figure out why the ID value is not coming across. I see so many examples and docs showing how to do this yet I obviously doing something wrong, http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J
[07:58:23] <seutje> any1 care to guess wat TheWarden's response data is? coz I sure don't
[07:58:28] <_foobar> matschaffer: ffs.. no it dident :P :D
[07:58:34] <_foobar> haha
[07:58:57] <matschaffer> TheWarden: ditto on seutje's comment. Also when I don't get data at all usually it's cause I'm crossing hosts/ports by accident
[07:59:24] <_ramo> is there an event to listen, when a user close the browser with (x) ?
[07:59:49] <matschaffer> _foobar: might help to know just what you're trying to merge into what. extend(a,b) basically takes all of b's properties and sets them on a.
[08:00:18] <coffeecup> how can i prevent an element from loosing its focus when clickin on another?
[08:00:19] <matschaffer> _ramo: http://api.jquery.com/unload/ ?
[08:00:55] <TheWarden> matschaffer: ahh how do you mean? I'm fetching an ID (unique) and then a descriptive value of the ID for the value.
[08:01:01] <_foobar> lets say $.extend($('ul'),$('li'));
[08:01:17] <_foobar> @ matschaffer
[08:01:34] <_foobar> simplified ofc
[08:01:39] <matschaffer> _foobar: first, that's kind of odd. But also you'd be extending the jquery proxy object at that point, not the actual node
[08:01:47] <Kambfhase> o.O
[08:01:57] <Kambfhase> what are you traying to do with extend there?
[08:02:00] <matschaffer> $('ul')[0], $('li')[0] might be what you're looking for. But I question your motives :-P
[08:02:04] <_foobar> yea.. me beeing lazy.. lets try again
[08:02:48] <seutje> ?g onbeforeunload
[08:02:50] <bot-t> seutje, onbeforeunload Event (BODY, FRAMESET, window, ...) - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536907(v=vs.85).aspx
[08:03:32] <matschaffer> TheWarden: I mean, that if I'm sitting on somesite.com/mypage.html, but the request is actually for somesite.com:1234/mypage.html or something like that. If the request crosses hosts/ports it's easy to end up with no data if you're not careful. I occasionally do it by accident, so might wanna double check that.
[08:03:56] <_foobar> matschaffer: http://pastebin.com/eW8kE1RF
[08:04:01] <matschaffer> But also I'd be curious to know what you're data arg is coming through as
[08:04:19] <seutje> _ramo: $(window).unload(function() { alert('yea, just keep on walking, punk!'); });
[08:04:30] <_ramo> matschaffer: unload is not working for me.
[08:04:40] <matschaffer> :(
[08:04:51] <_foobar> hihi
[08:05:20] <_ramo> seutje: i'm doin an ajax request on unload... but nothing was written to the file if i closed the browser
[08:05:29] <_ramo> i exactly to jQuery(window).unload(function() { ....
[08:05:49] <Kambfhase> ?add @ _foobar
[08:05:49] <bot-t> _foobar, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[08:06:12] <_foobar> Kambfhase: awesome ty
[08:06:16] <devil2005> how do i return the data from a div inside a ajax request?
[08:06:22] <seutje> _ramo: use sync?
[08:06:47] <_ramo> seutje: i did a jQuery.ajax({		url: 'fileadmin/tracking/ajaxlog.php',	async : false,... do you mean this?
[08:06:49] <devil2005> i know the load() function has .load('form.php #content') but im not loading, im posting
[08:06:50] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:07:07] <seutje> _ramo: yea, no workie?
[08:07:13] <scrieler> I have problems with IE and jquery corners, do u know a solution to get it working?
[08:07:27] <Kambfhase> _foobar: if your selections are static why not use the comma?
[08:07:33] <_ramo> seutje: no workie :D
[08:07:47] <AdvoWork> hi there, im using some very simple jquery to just add a row to a table, this fails, any ideas please? http://jsfiddle.net/YPQcB/
[08:07:50] <_foobar> what do u mean?
[08:07:56] <Kambfhase> scrieler: everyone has problems with IE and corners
[08:08:00] <_foobar> @ Kambfhase:
[08:08:03] <Kambfhase> _foobar: $('ul,li')
[08:08:08] <seutje> oh well, I gotta get going
[08:08:25] <devil2005> i saw in the ajax.load() function you are able to select a hook, only displaying the data you want in the response. e.g ajax.load('http://example.com #main-content') which will return the main content div. is there a way to do that but use POST instead of just GETting the page?
[08:08:45] <devil2005> i just want to return the contents of a certain div
[08:08:46] <_foobar> ooh.. no.. Its in a complex setup.. I dont know realy what cind of selector that actule gave me the objects
[08:08:51] <devil2005> instead of the whole page
[08:08:57] <wkmanire> I'm back
[08:08:58] <_foobar> @ Kambfhase
[08:09:15] <_foobar> thanks anyway
[08:09:22] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:10:09] <_foobar> Kambfhase: cant I do something like $(foo, bar); ?
[08:10:29] <Kambfhase> yes, but i doubt it will give you what you want.
[08:11:07] <Kambfhase> that would select all the foos within bar.
[08:11:26] <wkmanire> No would select all foo elements and all bar elements.
[08:11:27] <Ely^> hi does any one nnow a very good lightbox plugin that supports: audio, video, external html; recgonizes vimeo and youtube, images, video / image galleries and so on ?
[08:11:34] <Ely^> i found CeeBox but that does not support audio ;s
[08:11:35] <wkmanire> wait
[08:11:45] <wkmanire> nvm, I saw imaginary quotation marks
[08:12:07] <Kambfhase> devil2005: iirc there is no functionalily like that for post in jQ internally, but you can do that on your own manually
[08:12:51] <Kambfhase> imaginary quotation marks: when you see them, ...
[08:13:45] <Dr_Ford> jquery forever !! wooooooo!!!
[08:13:46] <TheWarden> matschaffer: Oh no no, my data is fine. I've checked the HTTP response and I'm getting the data back its just not populating into the form. I see the value but I don't ever see the ID value. If I try to display it I get "undefined". I'm trying to do ui.item.id
[08:13:53] <devil2005> how can i do it on my own Kambfhase?
[08:14:14] <matschaffer> TheWarden: ah! sorry. wasn't sure which id was the issue
[08:14:26] <matschaffer> bbiab though, work call
[08:14:41] <TheWarden> matschaffer: yeah, its the id value not the value value if that makes any sense :)
[08:14:48] <Kambfhase> devil2005: do the ajax, and in your callback do $(data).find('#example') and insert that where you want it!
[08:15:17] <m0dmd> sup everyone.
[08:15:20] <AdvoWork> this bit of code works: $('table > tbody > tr:first').before(tableString);  but how can i specify a table class name in there?
[08:15:31] <m0dmd> wkmanire sup buddy
[08:15:38] <wkmanire> m0dmd: howdy :)
[08:15:44] <m0dmd> getting back to work on rhythms
[08:15:54] <wkmanire> AdvoWork: "className.table > tbody > tr:first"
[08:15:56] <m0dmd> adding a simple html audio player
[08:15:56] <amcsi_work> hello
[08:16:04] <m0dmd> amcsi_work hellooo
[08:16:11] <wkmanire> or I'm backwards
[08:16:13] <wkmanire> table.className
[08:16:13] <Kambfhase> wkmanire: no.
[08:16:42] <amcsi_work> in $.ajax, is it normal that the error 400 Bad Request doesn't execute the error method?
[08:16:48] * wkmanire pulled an allnighter and is not 100% there today.
[08:16:49] <devil2005> $('#content').append(response.find('#result'));
[08:17:15] <devil2005> Kambfhase: doesnt seem like its working, nothing gets appended
[08:17:22] <DoctorDarren> When I have a draggable 5x wider than the droppable, the droppable seems to be activated by approx. the center of the draggable. is there anyway to have the droppable activated by the left most edge of the draggable instead?
[08:17:59] <TheWarden> anyone else have some suggestions as to why I can't get the id value (it returns undefined), line #33 http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J ?
[08:18:01] <Kambfhase> devil2005: getting any errors? is response a jQ object?
[08:18:26] <T-Pup> quick question - http://jsfiddle.net/3U7kk/ - i have two columns of checkboxes , i want to make sure that i have validation for the following scenarios a) 0 boxes checked (thats the first if statement) , b) make sure that at least one box is checked in col1 and col2 , i thought about adding a class to each col class=col1 etc, and then i'm not sure how to append the class title to the else if statements in my jsfiddle paste - any thoughts my frends
[08:18:26] <T-Pup> ?
[08:18:33] <AdvoWork> wkmanire, this works: $('table > tbody > tr:first').before(tableString);  yet $('maintable.table > tbody > tr:first').before(tableString); doesnt. any ideas?
[08:18:44] <T-Pup> would it be input:checkbox:checked:#col1 ?
[08:18:57] <wkmanire> AdvoWork: I gave you bad advice. its element.className
[08:19:04] <wkmanire> Sorry about that.
[08:19:13] <devil2005> Kambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/ it is just the text response
[08:19:46] <TheWarden> My value is returned fine and the id value is there as well just can't seem to populate it into the form <option value="id value here">value's value here</option> http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J
[08:19:53] <T-Pup> i guess i just need to be able to add a id or class to the else if statements right ?
[08:19:57] <Kambfhase> devil2005: did you click 'save' ? ;)
[08:20:04] <devil2005> haah sorry
[08:20:16] <AdvoWork> wkmanire, thanks :)
[08:20:23] <wkmanire> welcome
[08:20:32] <devil2005> http://jsfiddle.net/awBMx/
[08:20:37] <T-Pup> would .length work on a checkbox ?
[08:20:38] <Michael> ajpiano, Have you by chance heard any word of resolutions for the issues with htmlunit/webdriver and jQuery? When we upgrade from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 we have 37 qunit failures. 1.6 we have 404
[08:20:56] <T-Pup> i could just make it !$('#col1').length  rigth ?
[08:21:07] <T-Pup> and that would make sure at least one item with id col 1 was checked ?
[08:22:01] <TheWarden> Here is how I get the remote data for JQuery UI autocomplete, http://pastebin.com/EcSr7LdR
[08:22:01] <wkmanire> T-Pup: There should only ever be 1 element with a given ID.
[08:22:16] <T-Pup> so .col1 for a class which would be across multple elements
[08:22:16] <Kambfhase> devil2005: try http://jsfiddle.net/awBMx/1/
[08:22:26] <matschaffer> TheWarden: ahh.. I'm not super familiar with autocomplete. But this says to try ui.item.label: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/autocomplete-and-select-ui-item-id
[08:22:31] <wkmanire> T-Pup: Yeah, thats better.
[08:23:15] <AdvoWork> wkmanire, i have one more question sorry, im doing that which adds a new row to the top of my table, am i able to do that after my header? or before my table body instead?
[08:23:49] <devil2005> Kambfhase: still nothing shows in content
[08:24:04] <devil2005> the ajax gets sent , but nothing shows in the content div
[08:24:06] <wkmanire> AdvoWork: take a look at $.append() and $.prepend().
[08:24:09] <Kambfhase> hm, are you sure your ajax returns correctly?
[08:24:10] <_foobar> Kambfhase: add didnâ€™t work ether ..
[08:24:42] <Kambfhase> _foobar: hm? maybe paste some code and explain what you want to do again
[08:24:52] <_foobar> on it
[08:25:18] <T-Pup> didnt work :/
[08:25:22] <T-Pup> maybe .value instead ?
[08:26:20] <T-Pup> .value doesnt let me do anything now :/
[08:26:53] <wkmanire> T-Pup: try .val()
[08:27:15] <TheWarden> matschaffer: actually ui.item.label and ui.item.value are the same. It's not the ID, You see I'm selecting two columns, one called ID and another called Name. See http://pastebin.com/EcSr7LdR. The ui.item.value and ui.item.label is the column Name
[08:27:23] <TheWarden> argh this sucks
[08:27:42] <devil2005> Kambfhase: it returns correctly yes
[08:27:53] <Kambfhase> mkay
[08:27:56] <_foobar> Kambfhase:   http://pastebin.com/JY9g6Vup
[08:28:39] <T-Pup> wkmanire: here's my updated - http://jsfiddle.net/3U7kk/1/   it validates if 0 checkboxes are checked but doesnt validate on the class names , so i can still just check 1 box in col1 and it will go to the next page
[08:29:24] <Kambfhase> _foobar: you have a typo in your length
[08:29:36] <_foobar> sorry.. not the problem thow
[08:29:50] <TheWarden> The strange thing is if you look at line 17, I have the id and value. Its works fine here... http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J
[08:30:25] <Kambfhase> do you run the code after dom ready?
[08:30:53] <TheWarden> It works in the source: but not in the select:
[08:31:00] <matschaffer> TheWarden:  have you tried  suggestions.push({label: val.value, value: val.id}); ?
[08:31:01] <wkmanire> T-Pup: And you want it to return false unless all checkboxes are checked?
[08:31:37] <matschaffer> The "third variation" section on http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete#option-source seems to be saying that's what you should do
[08:31:55] <TheWarden> matschaffer: oh crap no, I think your on to something here. Let me try.
[08:31:59] <_foobar> Kambfhase: yes.. I get value 1 at alert
[08:32:10] <devil2005> Kambfhase: http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/2425/clipboard1306251063137.png
[08:32:18] <T-Pup> wkmanire: i want it to return false if 0 boxes are checked, but if they only check one box in column 1 and 0 in column 2, or vice versa, i want it to return false also , they need to choose a box in each column , so thats why i have it validating against 0 checkboxes (the first if) , and then it goes through each col (col 1 = class=col1) and (col2 = class=col2) , to make sure that one is checked from each column
[08:32:45] <T-Pup> thats why i added the classes for each column to differentiate etc :0
[08:32:46] <devil2005> you see it returns, and console.log($(response).find('#result')); returns that object
[08:32:52] <wkmanire> I see. and each column has a class named .colN?
[08:33:00] <T-Pup> yes
[08:33:26] <wkmanire> Just a sec, I'll whip something up.
[08:33:53] <Kambfhase> devil2005: btw you might want to get FireQuery.
[08:34:01] <wkmanire> T-pup: are those classes just marker classes?
[08:34:23] <T-Pup> market? they have no css relationship if thats what you mean, just identifier
[08:34:29] <phlp> T-Pup: if (!$('.col1 :checked').length || !$('.col2 :checked').length) { return false; } else { return true; }
[08:34:31] <wkmanire> marker*
[08:34:47] <Kambfhase> hm is you #result div hidden, maybe?
[08:34:47] <wkmanire> So they can all be named .col and it wouldn't matter?
[08:35:07] <T-Pup> wkmanire - it would, we need to differentiate between the ones in column 1 and column 2
[08:35:13] <devil2005> no its not hidden, if you like i cen send you both scripts. its really simple code
[08:36:11] <Kambfhase> feel free to do so
[08:36:48] <AdvoWork> im doing $('table.maintable > tbody').append(tableString);  but every time it adds 3 rows. Any ideas why?
[08:36:50] <T-Pup> phlp - that blocks everything - i have 1 item checked in column 1, and 1 item checked in column 2 , and still returning flase
[08:36:56] <wkmanire> T-Pup: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/3U7kk/2/
[08:37:12] <wkmanire> oops
[08:37:16] <wkmanire> forgot to assign result
[08:37:28] <wkmanire> http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/3U7kk/3/
[08:37:31] <wkmanire> thats better
[08:37:49] <TheWarden> matschaffer: Oh dang no way, it works. Thanks so much for the help even though it was so obvious :-).
[08:37:51] <T-Pup> checking
[08:38:12] <matschaffer> TheWarden: no worries. I learned something too :)
[08:38:32] <wkmanire> T-Pup: For that to work, you just need to have .col for each column that has checkboxes.
[08:38:39] <wkmanire> No need to number them since the logic for validation is generic
[08:38:42] <devil2005> Kambfhase: http://pastie.org/1966699 http://pastie.org/1966701 - the second link is drink.php
[08:39:04] <wkmanire> That $.each() is slightly optimized to stop running as soon as it realizes the form state is invalid.
[08:39:17] <wkmanire> if result === false then the .each() will stop iterating.
[08:39:52] <T-Pup> so i can throw my alert in the if === ?
[08:40:16] <TheWarden> matschaffer: now if I just understanding suggestions.push() better, because what if you had a third value to deal with how would you reference that?
[08:40:21] <Kambfhase> devil2005: try .filter() instead of find
[08:40:32] <wkmanire> http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/3U7kk/4/
[08:40:41] <matschaffer> TheWarden: it might just move anything from the pushed object over to item
[08:40:50] <matschaffer> try adding foo: "bar", then check ui.item.foo
[08:41:00] <devil2005> that works :]
[08:41:01] <devil2005> thank you
[08:41:09] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:41:14] <devil2005> no i will look up what find() does
[08:41:16] <TheWarden> matschaffer: yeah maybe, at least for now that is not a worry :-).

[08:42:05] <TheWarden> I have one more thing with JQuery UI autocomplete, after you are given some suggestions and the user selects on how can I clear the form field? You see I use a input text form field to search and then once selected
[08:42:29] <TheWarden> it is populated into a select element as an option so I need the input text field to be cleared after each selection.
[08:42:31] <wkmanire> T-Pup: Is that little algo working for you? I never tested it.
[08:42:38] <T-Pup> checkig it heh
[08:42:51] <wkmanire> Only ran my eyeball syntax parser on it.
[08:43:21] <T-Pup> nope blocking all
[08:43:22] <T-Pup> lol
[08:44:10] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, http://pastebin.com/jnpMaCWt
[08:45:46] <TheWarden> I've tried doing document.forms[0].ImportexportChannelFilter.value="" is various spots within http://pastebin.com/XiXC9c3J
[08:46:03] <TheWarden> but it never cleared the form field
[08:46:16] <TheWarden> after an autocomplete item selection that is.
[08:46:41] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: wow, thats um, a lot of table cells...
[08:48:17] <saba> There are no event occuring before / earlier the load event, right? :-)
[08:48:23] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, well yeah but there is a lot of data
[08:48:43] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, actually, fixed it
[08:48:51] <Kambfhase> kk
[08:48:52] <AdvoWork> doing v
[08:48:55] <AdvoWork> $('table.maintable tr:first').after(tableString); even
[08:49:03] <wkmanire> T-Pup: Should not be blocking the browser.
[08:50:13] <Kambfhase> saba: well ppl can click on buttons before the page is fully loaded and therefor generate click events. not sure that is what you wanted to hear, though
[08:51:04] <saba> Kambfhase: not exactly, but you've got a point. However I'm looking for automatically triggered events
[08:51:24] <saba> and hm, there's no way to trigger some event before the load event neither?
[08:51:45] <yanneq> in uploadify, how can i access the data that my php function returns after successful upload?
[08:52:21] <devil2005> does the crossDomain property in ajax allow the url to be pointed to a external link? e.g crossDomain: 'true', url: 'http://google.com'
[08:52:29] <Musok> hey guys... need some help around here
[08:52:32] <wkmanire> T-Pup: Don't forget to remove the numbers from those marker classes.
[08:52:40] <wkmanire> Just put class="col" in each column
[08:54:14] <wkmanire> devil2005: "If you wish to force a crossDomain request (such as JSONP) on the same domain, set the value of...." -- from the docs
[08:54:21] <Musok> so... here is the code im trying to get function http://pastebin.com/NQ6K6Rkz and here is the menu i'm trying to use http://arena.sendoushi.com/menu/
[08:54:32] <Musok> what's wrong with that code?
[08:54:41] <devil2005> but my request isnt JSONP it is just a simple post
[08:55:08] <wkmanire> But on a different domain right?
[08:55:21] <devil2005> yea, ive set it to true and it didnt work
[08:55:25] <wkmanire> You can do simple posts and gets to different domains
[08:55:37] <TheWarden> Is there any where I can read documentation on using suggestions and push?
[08:55:37] <wkmanire> You have to use the JSONP workaround.
[08:55:46] <devil2005> it looks for localhost/jqueryajax/google.com 404 not found
[08:55:48] <wkmanire> as far as I know
[08:56:04] <devil2005> oh i see
[08:56:10] <wkmanire> I wish that option had a different name, but I can't even offer a better one up.
[08:56:16] <wkmanire> I'm not sure what would be better.
[08:56:38] <wkmanire> useJSONPForSameDomainRequest
[08:56:39] <wkmanire> lol
[08:56:40] <timing> is it correct that stop propagation doesn't work when binding via live?
[08:56:58] <devil2005> JSONcrossDomian
[08:57:21] <devil2005> just CrossDomain seems like you can send any request, at least to me
[08:57:29] <wkmanire> devil2005: same
[08:57:31] <Kambfhase> timing: yes, because live depends on propagation.
[08:57:56] <timing> Kambfhase: ok, too bad :-)
[08:58:03] <wkmanire> timing: live binds events to the window object so all events have to bubble all the way up for live.
[08:58:26] <timing> wkmanire: o neat !
[08:58:47] <wkmanire> Well, "all events" probably isn't right
[08:58:55] <wkmanire> but DOM events anyway.
[08:59:06] <timing> yeah
[08:59:25] <T-Pup> i had to work it backwards, to something like this - the other way i couldnt get going - http://jsfiddle.net/3U7kk/5/
[08:59:38] <T-Pup> its not working yet but its getting easier for me to read it and maybe decipher it
[08:59:43] <Kambfhase> if you were using delegation you might be able to stop the buubling earlier though
[09:00:09] <wkmanire> T-Pup: That should have worked though... Without seeing your HTML it wasn't possible for me to test it.
[09:00:42] <T-Pup> oh oh i know lol , i'm just trying to do a cominbation of learning and fixing a bug of someone's code i didnt write lol :/
[09:00:44] <T-Pup> you know how that can be
[09:00:56] <wkmanire> I have an idea.

[09:01:18] <mackry> Any way to disable the overlay on jquery UI modal box?
[09:01:40] <wkmanire> mackry: The overlay is what makes it modal.
[09:02:04] <mackry> wkmanire: as well as the disabled functionality of the rest of the page
[09:02:08] <Musok> $("div ul li:last-child").css('background-color', 'none'); shouldnt this work?
[09:02:23] <Musok> if i get a href instead of none it works but none ... doesnt work
[09:02:33] <mackry> Musok: try tansparent
[09:02:39] <mackry> transparent
[09:02:40] <wkmanire> mackry: So you want a dialog, not a modal one?
[09:03:03] <Musok> mackry: thanks it's working... now i jsut have other thing to solve
[09:03:09] <mackry> wkmanire: Sure, what have you. But I want the modal disabled functionality, just not the overlay
[09:03:15] <Musok> maybe you can help me... its just the path to the right li
[09:03:23] <wkmanire> ahhh, i see.
[09:03:30] <wkmanire> You can adjust the overlay with CSS
[09:03:49] <wkmanire> But you need that div covering the other elements to keep click events from firing on them
[09:03:53] <Musok> i'm hovering div ul li:first-child and i want to get to the li:last-child of that same ul... can anyone help?
[09:03:53] <mackry> wkmanire: Okay, just thought there may be an option I know not of.
[09:04:08] <mackry> wkmanire: makes sense. thanks
[09:04:15] <wkmanire> no prob
[09:04:27] <timing> Musok: get all siblings().last() ?

[09:23:12] <bot-t> swiggy, .length
[09:23:18] <swiggy> oh durp durp
[09:23:28] <swiggy> what about the number that are not null (its a textbox)
[09:26:23] <swiggy> $('input[id^="email"]').not(':empty').length  ??
[09:27:39] <Ari-Ugwu> what does ^ do in that case?
[09:27:53] <mixmasterxp> How do I handle server 500 errors...or any errors at all for a  $.get operation?
[09:28:20] <Kambfhase> swiggy: $('input[id^="email"]').filter(function(){ return $(this).val() == "";}).length
[09:28:29] <phlp> swiggy: $('input[id^="email"][value!=""]').length
[09:28:59] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp, switch to $.ajax?
[09:29:08] <mixmasterxp> ok
[09:29:58] <Musok> :s .css('background-color') works but .animate({backgroundColor: '#400101'}) doesnt work!!!
[09:30:03] <silverdiamond_> right hometime, thanks again to the guys that offered help today :)
[09:30:04] <swiggy> oo smart thinking phlp

[09:30:28] <Musok> oh...
[09:30:53] <davejuk> I am using jQuery to apply TinyMCE to a textarea butI am having trouble getting the contents of the editor and passing it bacxk in an AJAX request. I get an undefined error on this: $("#savecontent").val()
[09:31:54] <swiggy> Kambfhase, ty for your snippet - but yours actually returns the number that ARE null
[09:31:58] <Musok> phlp: still not working
[09:32:12] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah.
[09:32:17] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp, I should say that -> I like using $.ajax because I code the errors into a custom response object. But there are other approaches
[09:32:18] <swiggy> but i am going to use phplp's option because it matched perfect and it is much condensed
[09:32:20] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp,  http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[09:32:55] <mackry> Musko: you could use css transitions
[09:33:04] <mixmasterxp> thanks
[09:33:43] <mixmasterxp> this is cool, so I can have a local exception and a global exception
[09:33:48] <Musok> yes but with css transitions i cant animate
[09:33:49] <Musok> right?
[09:34:06] <Michael> a { background-color: #000000; }  a.on { background-color: #400101; -webkit-transition: background-color 200ms ease-in-out; }
[09:34:11] <Michael> Try that in chrome
[09:34:29] <Michael> CSS transitions _are_ animations :D
[09:34:37] <Musok> :$ noob attack! ehehe
[09:34:42] <Michael> lol
[09:34:58] <Musok> but i cant do that
[09:35:06] <Musok> because the a is different
[09:35:17] <Kambfhase> use a class
[09:35:30] <Musok> and how do i swap?
[09:35:31] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp, yes. Though I would use it as a callback if you're namespacing your js. Are you?
[09:35:50] <Michael> Musok, .toggleClass('on') for instance
[09:35:55] <Aamir> How this can be simplify http://dpaste.org/qO2S/
[09:36:08] <Musok> Michael: tried that and wasnt working but i'll give it a try once again
[09:36:22] <Kambfhase> Aamir: &&
[09:36:25] <Michael> CSS3 transitiosn don't work in IE at all mind you
[09:36:28] <Michael> transitions
[09:36:41] <Musok> i need to work in ie
[09:36:51] <Musok> so... css transitions out of the way
[09:36:52] <mixmasterxp> Ari-Ugwu: Nope, I just throw code together in a script.js file. Any suggested articles on structuring your js code?
[09:36:54] <Michael> Then you have to use jQuery .animate() as a fallback
[09:37:05] <Michael> You can still use CSS3 transitions with the fallback ^^^
[09:37:10] <Michael> Graceful degradation :)
[09:37:13] <Musok> but i dont want to :P
[09:37:25] <Musok> so... i need to solve my jquery
[09:37:34] <Musok> http://arena.sendoushi.com/menu/ checking the source what do you think its the problem?
[09:37:52] <Musok> $(this.parentNode).css('background-color', 'blue'); works but $(this.parentNode).animate({backgroundColor: '#400101'}); doesnt
[09:37:57] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp, http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/namespacing-in-javascript/  (Looks okay)
[09:39:09] <phlp> Musok: try giving the ul a background color to start with in your css
[09:39:41] <Musok> phlp: it worked :D thanks
[09:39:49] <opdynamiks> Musok: yeah why would anyone "need" a color transition in IE.
[09:40:13] <Musok> phlp: it works but... doesnt let me do transparent nor none ... any idea?
[09:40:42] <opdynamiks> Musok:  for that you would need Opacity animation
[09:41:13] <Musok> by .css() method it won't have problem... damn...
[09:41:32] <phlp> Musok: you can use rgba.. look at the examples on the plugin page
[09:41:45] <Musok> its an idea...
[09:41:49] <Musok> i'll try out...
[09:41:56] <opdynamiks> again, no rgba in IE though
[09:42:05] <Ari-Ugwu> mixmasterxp, So ajaxError() is nice but I usually have a Ajax namespace in my project. So when something fails. I pass it Ajax.Error(request, error, callback)
[09:42:28] <Michael> Musok, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190560/jquery-animate-backgroundcolor
[09:42:45] <Michael> Musok, and http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[09:44:02] <Musok> thanks to all :)
[09:44:09] <djQuery> Musok: see ?jquery.ui.animate
[09:44:11] <bot-t> Musok, .animate() - Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[09:44:14] <Musok> now i just need to get rgba under css so it won't have alpha at the beginning
[09:44:43] <Musok> which i cant ... damn...
[09:44:44] <mixmasterxp> thanks
[09:44:50] <djQuery> Musok: http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[09:45:27] <Michael> can't?
[09:45:40] <Michael> IE doesn't support rgba does it?
[09:45:42] <Musok> without the fallback
[09:45:44] <Michael> not sure about 9
[09:45:47] <Musok> it doesnt
[09:45:49] <Musok> 9 does
[09:45:58] <Musok> but 8 doesnt
[09:46:04] <Michael> Musok, http://css3pie.com/
[09:46:05] <Michael> for 7 and 8
[09:46:24] <djQuery> Musok: believe that the jquery.ui extension of animate will take care of all of it for you
[09:46:33] <Michael> Keep in mind that every behavior: property in your CSS will execute css3pie.htc and if you have tons it'll slow your site down
[09:47:09] <Michael> er PIE.htc
[09:47:30] <Michael> Musok, And it's good to look at http://www.modernizr.com/

[09:56:45] <t432> what does that line do?
[09:57:01] <t432> get all elements?
[09:57:01] <djQuery> serializes all of the form inputs into an array
[09:57:14] <djQuery> inputs select textarea
[09:57:19] <t432> what if I want to choose which fields I want to send?
[09:57:54] <djQuery> disable the ones u dont want first? they wont be serialized
[09:57:59] <djQuery> ?serializeArray
[09:57:59] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:58:40] <mackry> Why doesn't jsfiddle support jqueryUI anymore, otherthan 1.4.4?
[09:58:44] <t432> can I just have multiple lons of data like the line I pasted for all the fields I want?
[09:58:51] <t432> lines*
[10:00:22] <wolfe> questions, questinos questions :P
[10:00:26] <djQuery> sure if you want it to be a pain in the ass. or if they all have something in commin   var data = {}; $('.submitfields').each( if(this.value && this.name){ data[this.name] = this.value;  } )
[10:00:30] <wolfe> some of which can be put on stackoverflow :)
[10:01:39] <Fogin[Work]> I am trying to do a ajax load of content but i want to insert som extra Js into the content at the same time can some one take a look and see where i am goign wrong
[10:01:40] <Fogin[Work]> http://pastebin.com/sTiSj2xf
[10:01:47] <djQuery> t432: ^^
[10:04:00] <djQuery> Fogin[Work]: WHY??????????????     $(''###attributes.formid#').live('submit', funciton(){Â alert("tst");Â returnÂ false;Â });
[10:05:02] <Ari-Ugwu> lot a wrong going on there.
[10:05:04] <ajpiano> djQuery: that's how you echo variables in coldfusion
[10:05:11] <ajpiano> and also escape hashes
[10:05:14] <Ari-Ugwu> ha!
[10:05:20] <Ari-Ugwu> oh coldfusion...
[10:05:36] <Fogin[Work]> sorry should have said there was some CF in there
[10:06:00] <c3l> I want to send all fields in a form as a json object. how do I do this best?
[10:06:04] <djQuery> ajpiano: still he could still use live instead of trying to attach it each time the item is loaded
[10:06:17] <ajpiano> yes
[10:07:06] <Fogin[Work]> so i would put that after $('###attributes.name#_content').html(data + msg) ?;
[10:07:06] <djQuery> was wondering what all the <cfifi> was about
[10:07:32] <t432> djQuery: for the above code to work do I need to add a class field called ".submitfields" for all form fields?
[10:08:34] <djQuery> t432: well u said you only wanted to submit some fields so I had to make something up on how to use your unexressed "which fields?"
[10:09:11] <ccmonster> hey guys, got any good multi level drop down menus?
[10:09:26] <djQuery> t432: you would also need to check to see if they were a select etc in there. ALL of which would be simplier with just .serializeArray
[10:09:48] <t432> here is the form http://pastebin.com/4GYPCuJD
[10:09:51] <djQuery> ccmonster: see ?ui.menu
[10:09:52] <bot-t> ccmonster, UI/Menu - Transform a simple list with a few links into a themable menu widget. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu
[10:10:27] <t432> I am trying to include all fields, howveer the end form will have fields that I wont be included
[10:10:33] <ccmonster> is that only available in the newest version of JUI?
[10:11:25] <t432> or can I used .serializeArray and use a unique class to identify all the fields that I want to include?
[10:11:29] <t432> use*
[10:11:46] <ccmonster> that didnt link right djQuery
[10:15:34] <ekkis> how can I set the click handler for 2 objects at the same time?
[10:16:35] <ajpiano> $("#this, #that").click(function() { });
[10:16:36] <ccmonster> $('#id1, #id2').click(function(e){// do some foo})
[10:16:56] <c3l> what's the best way to send all fields in a form as a json object. my intention is to submit a form, without reloading the page, and getting data back based on the submitted data.
[10:17:15] <ccmonster> $('form').serialize...?
[10:17:33] <djQuery> c3l: see .serializearray
[10:17:46] <djQuery> ?serializearray
[10:17:46] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[10:18:01] <ccmonster> hey djQuery , that menu link didnt work. something is up with the link to menu in the 1.9UI apii/docs etc
[10:18:25] <c3l> thanks
[10:18:27] <ekkis> ajpiano: oh... would that work for jquery objects too? var a=$('#x'), b=$('#y'); $(a,b).click()?
[10:18:38] <djQuery> ccmonster: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[10:18:53] <ajpiano> you should do a.add(b).click(fn);
[10:19:47] <ekkis> ajpiano: add... it's not like append... why not $(a,b).click()?
[10:20:00] <djQuery> ccmonster: there is also http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[10:20:10] <ajpiano> ekkis: .add is for merging jquery objects together
[10:20:34] <ekkis> cool
[10:20:51] <ekkis> ajpiano: still, would $(a,b).clikc() work?
[10:20:52] <djQuery> ajpiano: any way to get bot to link to ui.autocomplet to go to jqueryui.com instead of api.jquery.com?
[10:21:02] <ekkis> I mean, is there any reason _not_ to do that?
[10:21:31] <ajpiano> djQuery, not sure :/
[10:21:37] <djQuery> ekkis: $([a,b]).click
[10:21:39] <djQuery> ?
[10:21:42] <ajpiano> ekkis: yes, you shouldn't double-wrap jqueries for no reason
[10:22:18] <ccmonster> hm, so is this currently available in 1.8?
[10:22:35] <ekkis> djQuery: $(a,b) would be an array, no? so $([a,b]) would be an array of a single element containing an array?
[10:22:39] <djQuery> think menu is, its used by autocomplete I belive
[10:23:19] <ccmonster> hm. question is how to use it
[10:23:51] <djQuery> ccmonster: yes its not very well documented yet. but its just a nested ul
[10:25:05] <swiggy> can someone shed some light/ideas/fixication on this code -> http://jsfiddle.net/D8uND/1/  <--- What I am trying to do is, for every input box that is in the form (which is created dynamically after the one above it is filled out, and IS NOT NULL) another one shows up... but at anytime the user can remove these textboxes. Well when they submit this part of the form, it creats a div with <span> tags for each value [no problem so far], but here is the pr
[10:25:05] <swiggy> oblem: IF they remove a textbox, my for() will not include all of the textboxes because of the way it is counting the total # of inputs
[10:25:23] <swiggy> the example i posted @ http://jsfiddle.net/D8uND/1/ is very basic
[10:25:29] <swiggy> but should be enough to get an idea
[10:25:58] <swiggy> it will not work on jsfiddle because i didnt include everything, but if you read the code you should understand it
[10:26:40] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/D8uND/2/
[10:26:44] <swiggy> is actually a better example
[10:27:55] <djQuery> so instead of using a single input with , seperated list of inputs you are adding an input each time they fill one out?
[10:29:08] <swiggy> yes
[10:29:56] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/D8uND/3/
[10:30:03] <swiggy> has the create input and remove code
[10:30:09] <swiggy> again it will not work on jsfiddle
[10:30:12] <swiggy> bc of missing html
[10:30:16] <swiggy> but should get the idea
[10:32:38] <swiggy> any ideas?
[10:37:09] <DoctorDarren> Is there any way to have two draggable divs block each other from moving?
[10:37:50] <DoctorDarren> Like the way you can "contain" draggable divs in their parent, can you prevent them from running over each other?
[10:42:41] <phed__> Hi, I might have asked before, but
[10:42:47] <jexmex> I have <li> tags I am using a .each() to iterate through, inside each of these is a single a tag with ids of blah-X with x being a number.  I want to easly grab the a tag so I can get a atrribute of it, what is the best way to do this? I figure running through a .each() would work, but does not seem like the best option
[10:43:36] <phed__> I have a link where I override clicks. However, if it is middleclicked it is both opened in a new window & opened in the same window
[10:43:36] <ekkis> what's the tag?
[10:43:40] <phed__> How can I fix this?
[10:44:02] <wailqill> jexmex: .map() ?
[10:44:18] <ekkis> jexmex: $('li YourTag')
[10:44:38] <ekkis> jexmex: $('li YourTag').attr("id")
[10:44:53] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/D8uND/5/
[10:44:59] <djQuery> you mean somethin like that?
[10:45:32] <jexmex> ok, can I do it like $(this).('a').attr('id')? since this is inside a .each
[10:45:58] <swiggy> yeah i think i figured it out on my own
[10:46:04] <swiggy> but i did do something similar
[10:46:29] <jexmex> or maybe I need to do a .find('a').attr('id')?
[10:47:04] <godinaa> jexmex: That would work fine with the .find(). Unless you're doing something with that id value though inside the each block, the value won't be saved anywhere
[10:47:26] <godinaa> jexmex: That's why map is nice. It lets you run a method on each item and return an array of the results.
[10:47:31] <ekkis> jexmex: need the find()
[10:47:38] <jexmex> ok, thanks very much for the help
[10:49:16] <t432> how do I access this serizeArray?	data: $(this).closest('form').seriazeArray().
[10:51:27] <necromancer> t432: first of all, spell serialize right
[10:51:46] <necromancer> second of all, are you looking for the contents of .serialize()?
[10:52:20] <t432> yes
[10:52:24] <t432> sorry about type
[10:52:30] <t432> typo*
[10:55:48] <djQuery> t432: you could just make it easy on yourself and use http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[11:02:51] <Ari-Ugwu> t432, I also really enjoy -> http://mattnull.com/formation
[11:02:52] <sac> djQuery, that's nice... i've done kinda same but it uses class to define the form should use ajax... and it uses the form elements target and method plus some data attributes
[11:03:09] <Ari-Ugwu> Not *super* robust but it's so cleanly written that you can just add on to it.

[12:36:33] <adfasdf> sorry disconnected
[12:36:49] <adfasdf> i am totlaly lost and couldn't find the code which inserts "maininput"
[12:36:51] <adfasdf> are you there?
[12:40:07] <phlp> adfasdf: the link you sent to the plugin shows an id passed in tell it which input to use, your code has the plugin modified to use a single id. the best i can offer is use the code from the site you linked and dont modify the plugin unless you know what you are doing
[12:40:47] <swiggy> how do i make a check for a form validation to see if a <select> has any selected [its a <select multiple>] options?
[12:40:54] <adfasdf> phlp : could you tell me how to modify the current code to work with multiple input?
[12:40:59] <swiggy> i thought $('#myselectbox').val() == ''
[12:41:03] <swiggy> would but it doesnt
[12:41:24] <swiggy> if ( $('#myselectbox').val() == '' ){ //please select an option from the select box return false }
[12:41:29] <swiggy> but it still goes
[12:41:35] <djQuery> $('#myselectbox>options:selected').length
[12:41:57] <djQuery> swiggy: ^^
[12:42:01] <swiggy>  === 0 ?
[12:42:42] <swiggy> yep
[12:42:50] <djQuery> if( $('#myselectbox>options:selected').length){ // select at least 1}

[13:02:35] <phlp> swiggy: take the ! out of it on the last half
[13:02:47] <danzik17> Quick question:  Do you submit a request to change documentation on the jquery site via a ticket or some other method?
[13:02:50] <swiggy> is it options or just option?
[13:02:52] <adfasdf> i'm totally lost phlp
[13:03:07] <adfasdf> how do i get it to work for multiple textbox? should i pastebin the code?
[13:03:10] <adfasdf>  help
[13:03:15] <swiggy> well i want it to go off when there are not any selected
[13:03:20] <swiggy> if there are some selected
[13:03:24] <swiggy> no need to cehck
[13:04:32] <dabear> danzik17: I can make the change for you
[13:05:37] <swiggy> phlp, ?
[13:06:10] <danzik17> dabear:  The docs I'm referring to are on http://api.jquery.com/delegate .  The two examples that were given as being equivalent aren't equivalent since there's a difference in event bubbling.  Although the difference is explained a bit later, the two examples really can't be described as being equivalent
[13:06:46] <danzik17> Maybe change the wording to be "To accomplish a similar effect using .live()..."
[13:07:02] <phlp> swiggy: is it a multiselect?
[13:07:17] <swiggy> yes
[13:07:46] <dabear> ?source delegate:
[13:07:48] <bot-t> Line#3061 - "delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#3061
[13:08:04] <scrieler> hi, do u know a possiblitity to change the postion of the google maps terms?
[13:08:10] <adfasdf> phlp: can you give me an advice? i get stuck with this for almost 1 day
[13:08:11] <adfasdf> help
[13:08:26] <dabear> danzik17: delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {
[13:08:26] <dabear> 		return this.live( types, data, fn, selector );
[13:08:36] <dabear> that's all it does
[13:09:37] <djQuery> swiggy: something like this then http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HbR5f/2/
[13:09:45] <necromancer> $(".popupInit_' . $ID . '").bind("click", AL_CropAndImage.toggle_' . $ID . ');
[13:09:48] <necromancer> FUCK YOU CO-WORKERS
[13:10:25] <necromancer> if anyone in here sees themselves doing this, stop immediately and quit your job. you are not a programmer.
[13:10:31] <phlp> swiggy: not sure what djQuery has there but heres this http://jsfiddle.net/9wxmh/
[13:10:41] <blkcat> necromancer: yikes
[13:11:02] <dabear> necromancer: that code is just as awsome as your mom
[13:11:09] <dabear> interpret it the way you like :)
[13:11:48] <opdynamiks> lol necromancer
[13:11:52] <djQuery> necromancer: that doesnt make sense?
[13:12:08] <swiggy> phlp,  did u test your script? it is saying valid every time no matter what the senario
[13:12:09] <necromancer> djQuery: i understand it, the code is just fucking retarded
[13:12:20] <necromancer> why would you EVER generate a JS function with PHP
[13:12:21] <swiggy> o nvm
[13:12:23] <tdignan> the quoting looks odd
[13:12:24] <necromancer> especially the name?!?
[13:12:26] <tdignan> oh, it's PHP
[13:12:31] <tdignan> that explains it
[13:12:32] <necromancer> fuck that shit
[13:12:37] <madprops> any idea why if I move the jquery code that was in my html file to a separate js file it stops working properly?
[13:12:38] <swiggy> ok
[13:12:40] <necromancer> is it really that hard to pass an arg??
[13:12:45] <swiggy> working now, ty phlp

[13:28:57] <bittyx-laptop> i'm having a bit of a logic problem... say i have two lists of classes in string form, like list1 = ".class1, .class2, .class3" and list2 = ".class4, .class5, .class6" - i want to select all elements that have at least one class from list1 AND at least one from list2... what's the best way to do that?
[13:29:07] <tdignan> I need a way of selecting all IDs that match ^page-.*

[13:29:40] <tdignan> asdf___: what are your current guesses?

[13:30:11] <asdf___> so i'm lost tdignan
[13:30:21] <tdignan> Come up with a list of 2-3 reasons you *think* it might not be working
[13:30:26] <tdignan> then try to eliminate them
[13:30:34] <asdf___> thing is i can't come up
[13:30:36] <asdf___> i'm lost.
[13:30:48] <asdf___> i make sure it's different ids
[13:30:51] <tdignan> you should take a break and come back to it, let your mind un-stick a bit
[13:30:52] <asdf___> still it's not the issue
[13:31:01] <asdf___> can you have a look tdignan ?
[13:31:14] <tdignan> I could, but I'm not a big jquery guy. I'm a programmer though and I know the feeling
[13:31:23] <asdf___> i'm not good in jquery. i'm a newbie. can you give me some hints on where is wrong?
[13:31:26] <Ari-Ugwu> asdf___, Did you reduce that code at all to something readable? Or just leave for a few minutes, come back and repost?
[13:31:27] <tdignan> I'm just starting in jquery, but I have been stuck hard like this
[13:31:31] <asdf___> thanks tdignan i'm waiting.
[13:31:46] <tdignan> a walk can often be what it takes to solve a problem

[13:39:05] <asdf___> any pointers?
[13:39:11] <Ari-Ugwu> That *was* a pointer.

[13:41:30] <Patatouf> hello, i am using the interactions "droppable" and "draggable" for some classes. On my page I can refresh some div. In these refreshed divs, I load new divs with the droppable class. But as these divs dont exist when I load the page, these divs are not considered as droppable. Is it possible to correct that ?
[13:42:05] <djQuery> Patatouf: how are you loading them?
[13:43:14] <djQuery> Patatouf: $('.contentarea').load('myurl.php', function(){ $(this).find('.droppable').droppable();});

[13:49:36] <josephnexus> hi everyone!
[13:50:12] <yanick> hi, is there some issue reported for fadeOut() and friends? I have an element that I create dynamically, then I do a fadeIn() on it, and after a certain delay, fadeOut(), but the fadeOut does nothing. When I change fadeIn/fadeOut with fadeToggle(), the element fades in, but then flickers (like it it hides, and fadeIn again)
[13:50:14] <josephnexus> i'm trying to leran some jquery
[13:50:22] <tdignan> I am iterating over a bunch of elements. If I want to reference the Element (I'm using each()) Should I use 'this', or '$(this)'? both seem to work
[13:50:32] <josephnexus> and i've got some stuff working, but I'm trying to figure out how to bind an event after my ajax call completes
[13:50:52] <djQuery> Patatouf: yes. you might want to create a funciton that just applies the droppables attributes there
[13:51:33] <yanick> when I call fadeTo("fast", 0.5) on the visible element, it hides, then fades to .5
[13:51:36] <yanick> this is weird
[13:51:45] <Coderiffic> yanick: over the years I have had very poor results using animations with IE.  They may have gotten better, but I doubt it
[13:51:47] <Patatouf> djQuery, ok, thx a lot
[13:51:51] <josephnexus> pastebin is at http://pastebin.com/sYsecQ3P
[13:52:16] <yanick> Coderiffic, I'm pretty sure you are right, unfortunately, I'm running Ubuntu with Chrome :)
[13:53:25] <scrieler> do anybody know how to move the terms from google maps to right_bottom instead of bottom_right?
[13:53:36] <ravenzz> c3l http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:53:41] <Coderiffic> yanick: I wish I could offer more advice now, it's been so long since I've done any animations.  But I do know that part of what you're seeing is one animation starting before another has finished.  I also know that there are nice elegant ways to avoid that.  I know that I learned a lot from a roughly 10 minute video showing how to fade colors.
[13:53:47] <ravenzz> :(
[13:53:49] <ravenzz> :)
[13:53:56] <josephnexus> if anyone has any ideas how to have line 10 execute after line 9 is called successfully, that would help me out a ton.  I'm stumped. http://pastebin.com/sYsecQ3P
[13:54:35] <yanick> Coderiffic, I've used fadeOut() before without any problem.... and I don't really consider that "animation", but more of an "effect"
[13:54:57] <c3l> ravenzz: thanks

[13:56:52] <asdf__> hi all
[13:56:52] <Coderiffic> I always used animate beause you can specify exactly what you want to change and how, and make them all happen simultaneously.  Just a little finer control

[13:59:25] <djQuery> adfasf: no u posted a page with tons of stuff going on with at least 10 different javascript files on it
[13:59:39] <josephnexus> essentially, i want line 10 to happen when line 9 is actually called
[13:59:51] <c3l> ravenzz: doesnt that meen that I should be able to get the contents of a textarea by $('#form-id input[name="form-name"]').val()? but that doesnt work for me
[13:59:59] <ajpiano> josephnexus, .load has a callback parameter... which is a function executed when the load completes
[14:00:07] <ajpiano> ?load(url,fn) @ josephnexus

[14:00:54] <josephnexus> yes, ajpiano, i have read that, so I tried just copying line 10 into line 9 after the .val() section, but it failed
[14:01:34] <geekbuntu> adfasf, yes
[14:01:55] <ajpiano> josephnexus, it's hard to tell if you put it in the right place as the code is idented quited oddly
[14:02:17] <ajpiano> that is to say, not at all :p
[14:02:41] <amid_hasan> hi
[14:02:50] <ajpiano> it doesn't look like you're passing it as a callback to load though, josephnexus
[14:04:21] <astropirate> Is there a timeout or error  callback method for  ajax calls?
[14:04:41] <yanick> fubar
[14:04:49] <dlam> is there a way to capture this event:  'when someone stops typing in an text box for a second or two'?
[14:05:17] <dlam> i wanna run this function on keyup()   ...but not after *every* keystroke
[14:05:23] <ajpiano> dlam, yes, you use a debounced keypress event, seen here http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[14:05:32] <josephnexus> ajpiano... forgive my ignorance, i'm still learning how all of this works... I really appreciate the help.  http://pastebin.com/EHqYTrMG has the indentation cleaned up on line 9, i'm trying to get line 14 to execute as it's callback
[14:05:57] <dlam> cool! thx thx
[14:07:33] <RobDodson> If I select an element and use $.data to log a value for it, would there be a reason why selecting the same element and trying to pull that value from $.data would return null? If the context changes could that do it?
[14:07:50] <djQuery> josephnexus: you are defining them wrong Â  Â Â $("#customers").change(function()Â {$('#vehicle_list').load('<?php echo base_url()?>/index.php/customer/get_customer_vehicles',Â {selection:Â $("#customers").val()Â })})
[14:07:54] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I wanna toggle the div that has a videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected class, and then find the next div right after it and toggle that too
[14:07:59] <Nicolas_Leonidas> $('.videoImageBox').find('.videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected').toggleClass('videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected').toggle().find('div:first').toggle();
[14:08:05] <Nicolas_Leonidas> why does this not do that ?
[14:08:11] <josephnexus> djQuery, what do you mean?
[14:08:13] <djQuery> you cant pass it an object like that. load doesnt accept it that way
[14:08:14] <ajpiano> josephnexus http://pastebin.com/NSukyDa5
[14:08:51] <josephnexus> ah, i see
[14:08:56] <josephnexus> i think that makes sense now
[14:08:58] <josephnexus> i'll try it out
[14:09:12] <ravenzz> Nicolas_Leonidas you should add and .end() after toggle()
[14:09:33] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ravenzz: after the first toggle?
[14:09:40] <ravenzz> yes
[14:09:42] <josephnexus> thanks a ton djQuery and ajpiano
[14:09:49] <josephnexus> i _really_ appreciate the help
[14:10:29] <Nicolas_Leonidas> so this?
[14:10:30] <Nicolas_Leonidas> $('.videoImageBox').find('.videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected').toggleClass('videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected').toggle().end().find('div:first').toggle().toggleClass('videoImageBoxImageCurrentlySelected');
[14:10:37] <ravenzz> yes
[14:10:56] <Nicolas_Leonidas> it doesn't work, nothing happens
[14:11:19] <ravenzz> oh sorry
[14:11:40] <ravenzz> i don't pay attention to find('div:first')
[14:11:53] <Nicolas_Leonidas> it has to find the next div after the currently selected one
[14:12:01] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'm just trying to create some kind of image gallery
[14:12:09] <ravenzz> so .next('div')
[14:12:10] <ravenzz> ?
[14:12:39] <ravenzz> Nicolas_Leonidas due to learn something ?
[14:13:07] <swiggy> how do i hide the currently selected <option> from a select?? i tried     var value = $('#myselect').val();               $('option[value="'+value+'"]').hide();
[14:13:11] <swiggy> but it didnt work
[14:13:11] <Nicolas_Leonidas> yayyyy It works
[14:13:13] <swiggy> no errors either
[14:13:13] <Nicolas_Leonidas> ravenzz: thanks
[14:13:21] <davejuk> I have some HTML from a form input string which I want to post back through AJAX. Do I need to encode it for the POST?
[14:13:30] <ravenzz> because there are tons of ready to use gallery plugins
[14:13:57] <amid_hasan> how do you check if x-y-z numbers are in a string and count the numbers matched in that string irrespective of order?
[14:13:57] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what's the opposite of next?
[14:14:00] <Nicolas_Leonidas> .previous?
[14:14:05] <ravenzz> prev() ?

[14:16:05] * amid_hasan turns over in his grave
[14:16:34] <bbttxu> when i do $('#COL,#STAD,#MGOG,#RECS').click() , the action gets performed 4 times individually on each item. is it possible to have the action occur simultaneously?
[14:17:05] <amid_hasan> how is it that you can click on 4 divs simultaneously?
[14:17:29] <ravenzz> au revoir
[14:17:31] <bbttxu> links actually, have a map that might have preselected places
[14:17:53] <c3l> how do I get the value of a textarea with name='mytextarea' in a form with id='myform'?
[14:17:53] <djQuery> amid_hasan: if they are nested?
[14:18:12] <bbttxu> which i need to trigger when the map is loaded so they all appear
[14:18:17] <djQuery> c3l: see .find
[14:18:31] <djQuery> c3l: see ?selectors
[14:18:31] <bot-t> c3l, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[14:18:50] <djQuery> c3l: see ?.find
[14:18:51] <bot-t> c3l, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:19:03] <bbttxu> problem is when the first one goes, there is only one item, it pops open the infowindow, but the other three are added. if they were all sent at once then there'd be no infowindowâ€”the ideal situatiion
[14:19:04] <djQuery> c3l: see ?jqf
[14:19:05] <bot-t> c3l, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:19:07] <c3l> djQuery: I was looking at selectors. all I learned was that :input matches all inputs in the form. but I only need one specific...
[14:20:13] <djQuery> c3l: $('#myform').find('textarea[name="mytextarea"]')
[14:21:05] <djQuery> c3l: so you didnt look at this one at all? http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[14:22:21] <bbttxu> okay, thinking about this all weird, nevermind :)
[14:22:34] <c3l> djQuery: ah thanks. but isnt $('#myform textarea[name="mytextarea"]') sufficient? no need for the .find
[14:23:32] <djQuery> c3l: well you have asked quite a few of these myform things so you might want var myform = $('#myform'); then later you can do myform.find(.....)
[14:23:48] <djQuery> c3l: but otherwise yes
[14:24:35] <djQuery> or maybe explain what you are doing with all these inputs instead of asking about each one individualy.
[14:26:20] <swiggy> how do i hide the currently selected <option> from a select?? i tried     var value = $('#myselect').val();               $('option[value="'+value+'"]').hide();
[14:26:23] <swiggy> no errors either
[14:26:25] <swiggy> ???
[14:26:30] <c3l> djQuery: im sending the form data back to the server with .getJSON, and pushin back data based on the form. I dont want no page reloads or so. but now it all works as I want :)
[14:26:43] <ajpiano> swiggy $("#myselect option:selected");
[14:27:13] <swiggy> ah
[14:29:34] <djQuery> c3l: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[14:30:28] <djQuery> swiggy: is this a multiple select again?
[14:31:33] <swiggy> no
[14:33:33] <c3l> djQuery: looks interesting. thanks
[14:33:47] <swiggy> but ajpiano  didnt work
[14:34:01] <ajpiano> ajpiano is trying to work right now
[14:34:03] <ajpiano> .
[14:34:04] <djQuery> c3l: whatever you are doing someone has probably made a plugin lol?
[14:34:22] <djQuery> swiggy: fiddle?
[14:34:34] <N00b333> I once saw a "fish eye" javascript library that would enlarge picture thumbs on mouse-over and support clicking to see the full size image but i cannot remember what it was called or what site I found it on ... originally I got linked to it from the now down: http://blog.skynapse.com/jquery-fisheye/. Anyone know it?
[14:34:51] <swiggy> its just a select box
[14:35:04] <swiggy> i just want to hide the selected option on button click
[14:35:22] <astropirate> jQuery doesn't use XMLHttpRequest????
[14:35:44] <djQuery> N00b333: do a quick search came up with this http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2010/02/15-jquery-plugins-to-create-stunning-image-zoom-effects.html
[14:36:00] <erichynds> astropirate of course it does
[14:36:38] <astropirate> erichynds, hehe nvm it was hidden away in another file (on github)
[14:38:25] <N00b333> djQuery, thank you but I would not call it zoom just enlarge ... i.e. one mouseover the entier picture gets larger it doesn't just zoom into a specific piece of it
[14:39:21] <webdev2132> Hey guys
[14:41:08] <webdev2132> I have 3 different input forms on a page.  By default the first form is <form  name="getAQuote" > the other forms names are name=""
[14:41:28] <webdev2132> when a user clicks the input i'm using jquery specifically .attr to remove the form name from all forms and then add it to the closest
[14:41:36] <webdev2132> this is working fine except in IE. Any ideas
[14:41:38] <webdev2132> the code is this
[14:41:47] <webdev2132> 	$("input.enterContent").live("focus", function(){
[14:41:47] <webdev2132> 		$("form").attr("name", "");
[14:41:47] <webdev2132> 		$(this).closest("form").attr("name", "getAQuoteForm");
[14:41:55] <tdignan> don't paste in channel
[14:42:00] <webdev2132> sorry
[14:42:02] <tdignan> that's like blashphemy, really
[14:42:11] <webdev2132> i'll use pastie.org next time
[14:42:12] <tdignan> blasphemy  ;)
[14:42:15] <webdev2132> Any ideas though?
[14:42:19] <N00b333> damnit you know I think this was it: http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/components/fisheye-component :P
[14:42:22] <webdev2132> I've been stuck on this all day
[14:42:33] <webdev2132> I really need help
[14:42:45] <djQuery> webdev2132: looks about right to me. but why does it matter if they can all have the same form name?
[14:43:01] <djQuery> when you submit only hte one that was submited we be submited right?
[14:43:06] <swiggy> grrrr
[14:43:11] <swiggy> i cant get this option to remove...
[14:43:23] <webdev2132> long story short its a limitation of the system the form interacts with. the system is hardcoded to only process a form with a particular name
[14:43:44] <djQuery> webdev2132: then give all 3 the same formname
[14:44:11] <djQuery> if there is a submit button in each form only the form that contains the submit will actualy subit right?
[14:44:13] <astropirate> Does jquery have any debugging facilities that would allow it to do a console.log() if any exceptions are thrown in jQuery internal?
[14:44:16] <N00b333> djQuery, it is the jquery version of this: http://demo.quietlyscheming.com/fisheye/TileExplorer.html
[14:44:17] <webdev2132> djQuery if they all have the same name when I hit enter after hitting the input then it just defaults to the first form on the page
[14:44:54] <djQuery> webdev2132: does each form only have 1 input?
[14:45:12] <webdev2132> yes just an input for a users zipcode
[14:45:51] <djQuery> on focus of the input disable the other forms?
[14:46:23] <webdev2132> it removes the form name from them so they are essentially disabled
[14:46:29] <djQuery> webdev2132: capture the enter key of the input and submit the form manualy through code
[14:46:57] <webdev2132> capture the enter key at what point? when they click the submit button?
[14:46:58] <djQuery> webdev2132: well u have allready stated that is not an option because of an issue with IE
[14:47:08] <webdev2132>  a user has to be able to hit enter or click the button manually
[14:47:20] <webdev2132> well anyway around the IE issue
[14:47:32] <swiggy> i cant hide it
[14:47:35] <swiggy> but .remove works...
[14:47:45] <djQuery> webdev2132: capture key press on all the inputs. detect if the keypressed is enter. if so submit the form that the input is in.
[14:48:01] <scrieler> gn8
[14:48:23] <webdev2132> djquery not sure what you mean
[14:48:49] <webdev2132> for the form to process the name of the form has to be getAQuoteForm
[14:49:13] <swiggy> how come i can not hide an <option> ... ?
[14:49:19] <webdev2132> thats why i'm trying to add it to that particular form onfocus
[14:49:35] <djQuery> webdev2132: $('form input').keypress(function(e){  if(e.which == '13'){ $(this).closest('form').submit();}   });
[14:49:48] <djQuery> where 13 is the # for the enter key
[14:50:02] <webdev2132> how is 13 the enter key
[14:50:17] <webdev2132> what about if the user clicks the submit button instead of hitting enter?
[14:50:25] <djQuery> webdev2132: I dont have the #'s memorized you may need to look that one up
[14:50:38] <djQuery> webdev2132: it would still work as normal
[14:50:50] <webdev2132> well its not working on click either
[14:50:55] <swiggy> nvm
[14:50:57] <swiggy> .hide works
[14:51:03] <albertosheinfeld> What's the best javascript templating solution???
[14:51:16] <workmad3> djQuery: nice memory... 13 decimal is CR :)
[14:51:35] <albertosheinfeld> anyone has an idea? jQuery templates are good but i don't know if they are the best... i've heard about knockout but i want to hear your thoughts
[14:52:15] <smik> How to do something like gmail chat list, when you hover on a name a box shows up
[14:52:23] <djQuery> albertosheinfeld: templates is pretty complete, and most of the time once someone learns one they dont switch too much
[14:52:44] <blindMoe> smik: find a tooltip plugin
[14:52:51] <workmad3> smik: with a hover event
[14:52:56] <albertosheinfeld> templates you mean jQuery templates??
[14:53:25] <smik> blindMoe: I have hoverbox but it doesn't all to embed  HTML
[14:53:28] <djQuery> albertosheinfeld: yes
[14:53:36] <blindMoe> smik: so find a different one
[14:54:00] <smik> blindMoe: cool
[14:54:40] <albertosheinfeld> ok, we are using that one, but we have lot's of issues when updating data
[14:54:56] <albertosheinfeld> what's the command to type the name in huge letters btw? :p
[14:54:58] <JangKro7> is it possible to nest jquery UI tabs and will it work for ie8+ ?
[14:55:06] <jaequery> is z-index of -1 a valid syntax?
[14:57:29] <nerdshark|work> hey guys, i have a form to which i am programmatically adding groups of elements, and a button (which i am theming with jquery ui) that removes groups that have been selected. these groups consist of a checkbox and a text box inside of a div. now, i'm using jquery to test when one of these checkboxes is clicked, and when it is, it's supposed to enable the Remove button; and when none are selected,
[14:57:31] <nerdshark|work>  it disables the button. this works fine until i add a few elements and then remove all of them, after which the button won't re-enable when clicking on a checkbox. here's my code: (it doesn't quite work in jsfiddle, something to do with jquery ui there) http://jsfiddle.net/GFzTw/
[14:58:13] <nerdshark|work> can someone tell me why, after removing all of the divs and then adding more, the Remove button won't re-enable?
[15:07:44] <djQuery> nerdshark|work: $(".checkboxChoice > input:checkbox").click(  :(   $(".checkboxChoice > input:checkbox").live(  :)
[15:07:57] <djQuery> nerdshark|work: see ?.live
[15:07:58] <bot-t> nerdshark|work, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:08:30] <djQuery> $(".checkboxChoice > input:checkbox").live('click', function(){......
[15:10:31] <nerdshark|work> djQuery: hmmm
[15:12:43] <nerdshark|work> djQuery: perfect! that did it
[15:12:46] <nerdshark|work> thanks
[15:13:54] <antihero> When using the geo-autocomplete plugin I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '_renderItem' of undefined"
[15:15:32] <progrock> lol, the google translate api is pretty fun... only been messing around with it for like 30 minutes.. but got it to work decent with an extremely basic site: http://www.bobmonteverde.com
[15:16:16] <djQuery> nerdshark|work: $("#choices").delegate('input:checkbox',Â 'change',Â function()Â {
[15:16:23] <progrock> tho a lot of the languages fail (ned to test and not list the ones that do)
[15:17:23] <nerdshark|work> djQuery: that looks neat too
[15:17:26] <nerdshark|work> and probably cleaner
[15:20:17] <clorith> I'm using jQuery's .draggable and .droppabel to move images around on a site. I'm rebuilding the <img> tag based on the ui.draggable.attr() feature, storing it in a variable then running a .remove() on the old content before using .html(variableName) to add it in the new droppable container.
[15:20:36] <clorith> For some reason the .remove also removes my variableName in some odd manner so that my .html() adds nothing to the page
[15:21:14] <clorith> The variable is still populated after the .remove() is called though
[15:23:12] <nerdshark|work> djQuery: oh god thank you for showing me .delegate()
[15:23:16] <clorith> There's a live demo available at http://rstt.net/puzzle/ if someone has a moment
[15:23:27] <nerdshark|work> i have been looking for this bit of functionality for a while
[15:26:22] <astropirate> I am going through the jQuery code but can't seem to be able to find where jQuery.support.ajax is set. Anyone have a clue?
[15:27:32] <snover> yes
[15:33:20] <webdev2132> is it possible to change a forms name with the .attr method?
[15:33:35] <clorith> Of course
[15:34:11] <webdev2132> in ie7 this isn't working though. $('form').attr('name', '');
[15:35:01] <webdev2132> I'm trying to take the attribute name and simple remove it from all forms on the page. yet its not working in ie why is that Clorith?
[15:36:54] <snover> webdev2132: first of all, an empty string is not the same as removing an attribute. second of all, why do any of the forms have a name attribute at all?
[15:37:06] <clorith> webdev2132, why add the name attribute to begin with if you intend to remvoe it any way?
[15:37:48] <praveen_> hello all, first time joing this :)
[15:38:10] <funnylookinhat> If my DOM is <div><input><span class="whatever"></div> - how do I select the input from this event?  $('.whatever').click() ?
[15:38:17] <funnylookinhat> $(this).parent(). ???
[15:38:27] <webdev2132> Well I have 3 forms on the page. Each with one input for a user to enter there zip-code.  <form name="getAQuoteForm" > is needed to process whatever form the user uses
[15:38:52] <webdev2132> therefore I want the name to be removed from all forms and then simple added to the form the user is using. Its working fine except in IE
[15:39:05] <clorith> Sounds like a horrible way of doing it
[15:39:17] <clorith> You know that whatever form you are using will be submitted, the other two won't be touched any way
[15:39:27] <webdev2132> could you come up with a better solution
[15:39:34] <praveen_> $('div').find('input')
[15:39:41] <webdev2132> correct the user only submits one form
[15:39:52] <clorith> Does it submit through ajax or anything else
[15:40:01] <clorith> or jsut a "submit" button that sends it to a submissions page?
[15:40:37] <clorith> If thel atter, you don't need to change names etc, it's already handled for you as the content of the form with the clicked submit button is all that is sent. If the prior, you'd have to distinguish between data somehow any way
[15:40:55] <webdev2132> theres a javascript file, I don't have access to edit, that takes the form and submits it to another application.  In order for that file to work the form Name has to be what it is in that file, since its hardcoded there
[15:41:47] <clorith> well, that might be it then
[15:42:08] <webdev2132> might be what?
[15:42:15] <clorith> if you change the name afterwards, and the submit .js file isn't looking or live changes, it won't pick up on the new name
[15:42:39] <webdev2132> no it works fine just not in ie because the name isn't being changed/removed in ie
[15:43:00] <clorith> did you try setting it to a value instead of blank?
[15:43:31] <clorith> IE might jsut not support empty attributes
[15:44:26] <webdev2132> http://pastie.org/1968618
[15:44:47] <webdev2132> theres the code. the class name of the input for the user is enterContent
[15:44:57] <webdev2132> so you see that code works fine for everything except IE
[15:44:59] <webdev2132> any ideas?
[15:45:10] <clorith> jsfiddle.net
[15:45:48] <clorith> although as I said, try giving the attribute a value instead of blank, see if IE jsut doens't support empty ones
[15:46:18] <sterlo> anyone have experience with: http://www.scotthorlbeck.com/code/tochecklist/#accessible_example - anything good or bad to say about it?
[15:48:16] <webdev2132> doesn't work with that either clorith
[15:49:07] <snover> ?nopm @ webdev2132
[15:49:08] <bot-t> webdev2132, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[15:49:31] <webdev2132> snover, how do you remove an attribute entirely instead of giving it just ""
[15:49:37] <webdev2132> you mentioned this earlier
[15:49:42] <sgrover> I'm looking for a decent jQuery based notification tool.  I've seen "jQuery UI Notifications" that seems cool, but is this current/available?  Is it part of the next UI release or independent?
[15:50:11] <clorith> sgrover, jGrowl has proven quite user friendly in my experiences
[15:50:40] <clorith> webdev2132, I've no idea then
[15:51:30] <webdev2132> what about having the 3 forms, but they just post to a 4th form on the page, and that form has the Form -name needed?
[15:52:29] <snover> webdev2132: the name attribute of a form does absolutely nothing btw
[15:53:19] <snover> itâ€™s a deprecated dom 0 legacy attribute
[15:53:33] <snover> and, please ask http://api.jquery.com about removing attributes
[15:53:56] <bittyx-laptop> hiya! .slideUp() and .slideDown(), by default, hide and show objects, respectively. is there a way to invert this behavior, so that .slideUp would show the element, and .slideDown would hide it?
[15:54:57] <clorith> I'm using jQuery's .draggable and .droppabel to move images around on a site. I'm rebuilding the <img> tag based on the ui.draggable.attr() feature, storing it in a variable then running a .remove() on the old content before using .html(variableName) to add it in the new droppable container.
[15:55:01] <Anitox> what if you just did vertical-align: bottom; instead?
[15:55:06] <clorith> For some reason the .remove also removes my variableName in some odd manner so that my .html() adds nothing to the page
[15:55:09] <clorith> The variable is still populated after the .remove() is called though
[15:55:56] <clorith> I have a live example at http://rstt.net/puzzle/
[15:55:58] <webdev2132> snover, the name attribute isn't depreciated in forms
[15:56:05] <sgrover> clorith: thanks.  That's pretty close to what we were after.
[15:56:08] <Anitox> deprecated*
[15:56:42] <snover> webdev2132: <form name> most certainly is.
[15:57:32] <webdev2132> snover are you sure?
[15:57:42] <snover> bro
[15:57:42] <snover> yes
[15:57:43] <snover> i am
[15:57:46] <snover> exceedingly sure
[15:57:49] <snover> http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-name-FORM
[15:59:03] <webdev2132> snoover, that doesn't say anything about it being deprecated
[15:59:10] <clorith> webdev2132: it does
[15:59:16] <clorith> it states one should use the id attribute
[15:59:16] <snover> it is discouraged.
[15:59:24] <snover> if you want to split hairs about it.
[15:59:35] <Anitox> "Applications should use the id attribute to identify elements."
[15:59:56] <webdev2132> :( i hate life
[16:00:24] <Anitox> is the feeling reciprocated?
[16:01:12] <TheWarden> good night
[16:01:44] <webdev2132> Okay lets back up
[16:01:51] <webdev2132> say you had 4 forms with 1 input each
[16:02:05] <webdev2132> and the javascript that processes this form, you didn't have access to it
[16:02:19] <Anitox> sounds like ajax is gonna solve this problem
[16:02:24] <webdev2132> in order for the form to work you needed the form name="getQuote"  how would you handle this
[16:02:46] <snover> you donâ€™t need that in order for the form to work because the name attribute is completely unrelated to the functionality of a form
[16:03:06] <tman> var cms = $("#mentalState"); console.log(cms); returns null why?
[16:03:07] <Anitox> a form submits, and never passes its name
[16:03:11] <webdev2132> yes but the javascript that parses the form uses the form name attribute
[16:03:22] <snover> tman: because you have not loaded jquery.
[16:03:24] <clorith> snover, sounds like the javascript he has no access to is setup with $("[name=getQuote]") (god knows why)
[16:03:27] <snover> tman: or you have overridden it with something else
[16:03:35] <tman> ok
[16:03:35] <snover> webdev2132: then fix it.
[16:03:42] <tman> or it might not be in the dom
[16:03:42] <EM03> I'm doing sort of a digg style website, now when a user votes i would like for it to update the votes of all items on the page .....whats the best way to go about this?
[16:03:44] <tman> hmm
[16:03:55] <snover> tman: no, calling $ always returns a jquery object. always.
[16:03:59] <snover> it never returns null.
[16:04:00] <tman> ok
[16:04:01] <snover> unless it is not jquery.
[16:04:29] <webdev2132> I can't fix it
[16:05:57] <snover> â€œcanâ€™tâ€
[16:06:48] <coldhead> Kant?
[16:06:55] <webdev2132> in ie why is 		$("form").removeAttr("name");  not removing the name attribute from all forms?
[16:07:00] <tdignan> programming is not for whimps
[16:07:17] <webdev2132> no I literally have no access to the files you want me to fix.
[16:07:26] <webdev2132> thats why I can't do it.
[16:07:41] <tdignan> sounds like a client-related problem
[16:07:42] <tdignan> lol
[16:07:58] <webdev2132> you have no idea
[16:08:01] <webdev2132> how true that is
[16:12:37] <bittyx-laptop> okay, what could be causing the following non-responsive behavior: i'm doing $('a.someClass + a.otherClass').prev().find('img').mouseover(function() { console.log('over'); }); <--- the complete selector before .mouseover returns the elements i want (tested in the console). however, the mouseover event doesn't get bound for some reason. even doing $(...completeSelectorToIMG...).trigger('mouseover'); doesn't show anything in my console.
[16:14:18] <coldhead> wtf ezra
[16:23:55] <tydeas> can someone remind my how to filter a class of checbox for the ones that are filtered?
[16:25:52] <SirFunk> is there a reason this wouldn't work: $(this.el).html(ich.template_charge(this.model.toJSON())).appendTo(this.chargeTable).fadeIn('slow');   ... it appends it but the item ends up with it's opacity being 0
[16:26:17] <bittyx-laptop> okay, now this is weird. i my init.js file, i've got $('a.someClass').prev().mouseover(function(){console.log('over');}); <--- when i load the page, nothing gets logged for the mouseover event (it isn't bound). when i copy/paste the exact same code in my console, it starts working. everything else in my init.js works as expected. if i remove the .prev(), the event gets bound as expected (though, to the wrong element). what could be causing this?
[16:26:50] <bittyx-laptop> it's not dynamically loaded content or anything like that, either.
[16:32:54] <Draconisle> Hi Guys
[16:33:51] <Draconisle> I was wondering if someone could answer some of my questions regarding jQuery UI
[16:34:00] <bittyx-laptop> okay, what the hell. i have, in my init.js file, within an $(document).ready(function() { ...} ) block, console.log($('a.someClass').prev()); <--- when the page loads, i see that the console logs just [ ], ie. no matched elements. when i copy/paste the same line into the console, it finds all the elements. the elements are not loaded via ajax; they're in the document's original source. wth?
[16:34:31] <bittyx-laptop> Draconisle: just ask, if anyone can help you they will; although it seems the channel is pretty much dead right now
[16:34:45] <Draconisle> when does it usually get busy?
[16:34:59] <Draconisle> cause I am gonna have a lot of questions
[16:35:01] <Draconisle> hehe
[16:35:22] <Draconisle> trying to build an app for work and I'm a jQuery beginner
[16:35:40] <Draconisle> so basically I am trying to have a floor plan page
[16:35:49] <Draconisle> its a map with pins on it
[16:36:00] <Draconisle> I am using the Draggable UI
[16:36:17] <Draconisle> but when I have the browser window smaller than the container
[16:36:29] <Draconisle> and then I drag the object outside of the container
[16:36:35] <Draconisle> it actually goes beyond it
[16:36:54] <Draconisle> which is a fatal bug when trying to determine exact positioning on a floor plan
[16:37:43] <Draconisle> Is anyone aware of this bug?
[16:42:45] <devil2005> Draconisle: its not a bug
[16:43:07] <Draconisle> How do I account for it so it doesnt do it?
[16:43:27] <devil2005> Draconisle: use the options, .draggable({containment: 'parent'})
[16:43:28] <Draconisle> exact positioning checks everytime its moved?
[16:43:44] <devil2005> so the box can only be dragged around inside its parent
[16:43:53] <Draconisle> let me try that
[16:44:16] <Draconisle> right now, I am using the ID of the parent
[16:44:29] <devil2005> Draconisle: use the options, .draggable({containment: '#parentid'})
[16:44:43] <devil2005> use that if you want to use a hook instead of just 'parent'
[16:46:02] <Draconisle> I am using the id of the div
[16:46:12] <Draconisle> but it is still doing it
[16:46:33] <Draconisle> my guess is that it might be an actual bug, it happens in IE8 and chrome
[16:47:05] <Draconisle> of course the demo online, I think has overflow on
[16:48:24] <devil2005> if you pin div dragging out of the map div?
[16:48:58] <Draconisle> yes
[16:49:17] <Draconisle> so lets say I have a div that is 500 x 500 px in size
[16:50:01] <Draconisle> if my browser window right now isnt maximized and it is smaller than the map, then I could drag and drop the pin WHILE scrolling in the browser window
[16:50:14] <Draconisle> this will create a bug to allow me to actually go beyond the container
[16:51:16] <Draconisle> $('.seat').draggable({"containment": 'parent'}); and $('.seat').draggable({"containment": "#mapContainer"}); do not work
[16:51:47] <phishbot> animate() doesn't return promises by default, correct?
[16:53:20] <Draconisle> promises?
[16:53:27] <phishbot> a promise object
[16:53:40] <phishbot> a Deferred's promise object
[16:55:31] <devil2005v2> my internet died
[16:55:42] <devil2005v2> you are delecting .seat.
[16:55:49] <devil2005v2> select the specific div instead
[16:55:56] <devil2005v2> as that is what you want to be draggable
[16:56:19] <Draconisle> the .seat is the pin
[16:56:34] <Draconisle> the container is the #mapContainer
[16:56:49] <smik> Is the developer of jQueryTools here?
[16:56:51] <Draconisle> so I make the seat pins draggable within the mapContainer div
[16:57:38] <devil2005v2> look here
[16:57:39] <devil2005v2> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement
[16:58:22] <bittyx-laptop> okay, i have a bit of a problem. i have .mouseover() and .mouseout() events on an element that .show() and .hide(), respectively, another element, with an animation ('slide') - ie. the showing/hiding takes some time. if the .mouseout() is trigger while the .show() animation is still running, it makes a complete mess out of the elements. is there a way to ensure that .hide() will be run only after the current .show() animation is finished?
[17:00:29] <Draconisle> omg I love you sir
[17:00:32] <Draconisle> you just fixed it
[17:00:42] <Draconisle> I tried the scroll: false option
[17:00:46] <Draconisle> perfect fix now
[17:01:20] <devil2005v2> :]
[17:01:25] <devil2005v2> no problem
[17:02:30] <Draconisle> so hopefully you are feeling generous
[17:02:39] <Draconisle> cause my brain is still stuck on NOOB
[17:03:00] <Draconisle> How do I add jQuery plugins without conflicts?
[17:03:25] <Draconisle> I am trying to add a tooltip for the pins
[17:03:41] <Draconisle> so that when you hover over the pins, you can see the person sitting there
[17:03:48] <Draconisle> and all the information for that seating
[17:05:35] <devil2005v2> there shouldnt be any conflicts
[17:06:10] <devil2005v2> just add the <script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugin.js"></script>
[17:06:27] <devil2005v2> and look at the documentation on the plugin
[17:07:10] <Draconisle> do you know how to override the tooltips without using a plugin?
[17:07:30] <Draconisle> it would probably be easier to understand if I didnt have to use someone elses code
[17:08:05] <devil2005v2> google the plugin name so you have the documentation for it, you will understand it.
[17:09:35] <Draconisle> how do I tell if a plugin is created by the jQuery developers instead of a 3rd party, is there a way?
[17:11:02] <devil2005v2> it shouldnt matter, the community plugins are the best and its only a matter of testing
[17:11:12] <Draconisle> awesome sir
[17:11:15] <Draconisle> much thanks
[17:11:19] <devil2005v2> no problem
[17:11:33] <Draconisle> I was just confused with the demos people post
[17:11:58] <Draconisle> they have so many links at the head that I dont know what I need for dependencies
[17:12:15] <Draconisle> good thing I found the Tooltip documentation
[17:12:20] <Draconisle> and its great
[17:12:26] <Draconisle> much much thanks for everything
[17:22:31] <couchero> may I ask if there is anyone here with jquery mobile experience?

[17:44:31] <djQuery> $('#PerrryComo').play();
[17:44:46] <delinquentme> is there some kind of read out (console.log doesnt work ) that will give me feedback for debugging in IE 8?

[17:49:25] <jedimind> i believe he's being a little sarcastic
[18:00:31] <bittyx-laptop> i think i've found a bug in jquery. http://nsnight.levacic.net/ <--- move your mouse over the picture with the girl in the red shirt holding a camera. there's some text that shows up, and it's bound to a .mouseenter() for that picture, so as to prevent propagation problems (the whole .mouseenter() vs .mouseout() thing). it works correctly in chrome. however, in firefox 4, if you move the mouse into the picture from the bottom side, it will keep
[18:00:31] <bittyx-laptop>  triggering the .mouseenter() indefinitely (without .mouseleave() ever being triggered - see the console). am i correct in thinking this is a bug, or am i doing something wrong?
[18:01:28] <Nuckin> So I have two files in the same directory, the index is calling $(selector).load("other.html"); where selector is a div, all the HTML loads in but all the image links are broken, I've been trying to figure it out but I keep coming up with nothing
[18:01:38] <Nuckin> anyone have any ideas?
[18:02:01] <bittyx-laptop> it works correctly in opera and chrome, but ff4 makes it go crazy.
[18:02:39] <bittyx-laptop> Nuckin: right click on any image that's broken and see where it points to
[18:04:11] <Nuckin> bittyx-laptop: oh wow, shoulda thought of that, 403'd on me

[18:38:51] <rosieres> hi, hast anybody some practice in smoothdivscroll ?
[18:47:52] <lamerion> hmm guys i binded a scroll event on window, anyway to stop that event from firing when i scroll the page by code?
[18:47:54] <lamerion> http://pastebin.com/wr9GRHLG
[18:50:46] <m0dmd-> yo yo yo!
[18:51:05] <Ratty> m0dmd-, Sup ho!?!?!?
[19:19:23] <lamerion> hmm quiet
[19:31:32] <lamerion> hah nvm solved it... although less elegant
[19:38:05] <saturdayplace> is it possible to include templates in an external file, instead of inline on the page?
[19:40:41] <garann> saturdayplace: it is, but you have to load them manually afaik
[19:42:04] <saturdayplace> garann: through an ajax call, or something?
[19:42:34] <garann> yeah, or you could get real fancy and use require or something
[19:43:00] <Whirl3d> Good Evening all. To check an item to see if it's a jquery item, you can just use: item.jQuery    or is it   item.jquery  ?
[19:45:39] <Whirl3d> Nobody? Nothing? Odd...
[19:51:27] <Whirl3d> Where is everyone?
[20:01:33] <Whirl3d> it's a ghost town in here.

[21:25:31] <progrock> man, can;t figure out why that after I translate, the menu widths are wrong (but when you open then close a menu item it works perfectly) http://www.bobmonteverde.com/
[21:38:20] <tdignan> which method can print not only the text of the current element, but also the current element itself, for debugging?
[21:39:26] <progrock> $(this).parent().html() ?
[21:40:04] <progrock> for debugging?? have you heard of "right click -> inspect element".... but the above should eb what you are askign for I think
[21:40:31] <tdignan> whoa whoa, jquery isn't the only javascript framework you know
[21:40:36] <tdignan> I  was just asking for a hint
[21:40:37] <tdignan> thanks
[21:41:46] <tdignan> trying to debug some html onhashchange stuff, can't use right click for it
[21:41:53] <ajpiano> tdignan: console.log
[21:42:00] <progrock> Ummm, wasnt trying to sound liek an ass.
[21:42:03] <tdignan> i'm aware of console.log and alert()
[21:42:07] <ajpiano> you can log any type of object, not just strings
[21:42:11] <tdignan> I just needed to know how to get the html + text
[21:42:15] <tdignan> of the current element :)
[21:42:27] <ajpiano> did you figure it out :p
[21:42:30] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[21:42:31] <progrock> but, fuck.. for osmoene who won't google or look up a simple thing, you sure get offended that we jsut figure you don't eactly know what you are doing
[21:42:35] <progrock> I apologize
[21:42:37] <tdignan> progrock told me
[21:42:46] <tdignan> progrock: actually I tried searching the docs
[21:42:49] <ajpiano> KWhat4: yes it is possible to extend a widget
[21:42:53] <tdignan> sometimes it is difficult to find what you're looking for
[21:43:04] <wkmanire> mmm, whiskey. mmm chocolate icecream.
[21:43:38] <m0dmd-> yo yo yo!
[21:43:41] <wkmanire> Anyone else following the Canucks/Sharks game?
[21:43:41] <m0dmd-> Sup beautiful peeps
[21:43:51] <ajpiano> ooh good idea wkmanire
[21:43:56] <wkmanire> Double over time. this game is crazy
[21:44:00] <peeps[lappy]> not much m0dmd-  :-*
[21:44:09] <Whirl3d> anybody notice a weird thing about .fadeIn and .fadeOut? I can't get it to fadeIn if I manually set the opacity of an element to 0 first.
[21:44:33] <m0dmd-> why would you set the opacity of an ele if you're using fadeIn/Out
[21:44:45] <progrock> tdignan: look through the section in the docs on traversing.. that covers most questiosn you have
[21:44:49] <m0dmd-> try .animate({})
[21:44:56] <progrock> you'll*

[21:45:44] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks. I need to start checking the bug list. Sorry abou that.
[21:45:46] <wkmanire> Hmm, thats a nice little gotcha

[21:50:16] <wkmanire> Dammit Sharks. $('.sharks').choked() again!
[21:50:17] <progrock> Can anyone help me figure out why these widths aren;t calculated right after translating until I manually click twice http://www.bobmonteverde.com/
[21:50:23] <progrock> I;ve tried delays, and otehr thing, no luck
[21:50:33] <progrock> things*
[21:50:39] <ajpiano> there's mad drama
[21:51:07] <wkmanire> They were ahead until the last 20 seconds of the 3rd period
[21:51:24] <progrock> Even tho I am calculating the width after teh tarnsaltion, and its using the exact styles and textteh decond time as it is the first
[21:51:33] <coldhead> #jQuery-sports
[21:51:46] <wkmanire> coldhead: he he he
[21:53:24] <wkmanire> ajpiano: You found it just in time to see the game end. That is what I call efficiency.
[21:53:42] <ajpiano> haha yea wow sorry for putting the kibosh on yer sharks
[21:54:46] * wkmanire pouts.
[21:56:59] <wkmanire> Ah well, I'm gonna go load up NHL on my xbox and beat up the Canucks with the Sharks.
[21:59:13] <gf3> rude
[22:07:44] <coldhead> can someone pleae feed, bathe, dress and kill me?
[22:08:33] <Brodingo> so selfish
[22:08:38] <djQuery> Y? just skip to the end the other items are unnecessary
[22:08:59] <Brodingo> dont you think other people are busy killing themselves and maybe dont have time for that kind of shit?
[22:09:10] <djQuery> hat unneeded code steps
[22:09:53] <coldhead> its how i want to make my peace with the world
[22:10:01] <coldhead> why do they give death row inmates a last meal?
[22:10:06] <coldhead> THEY DON'T NEED IT
[22:10:52] <djQuery> once the brain analyzer is finished we can skip the whole death row and just move to the death part
[22:11:17] <progrock> I really don't understand this warning in chrome: Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type font/woff.   why is that not correct?
[22:11:38] <coldhead> because the left hand of google doesn't know what the right hand of google is doing
[22:11:42] <coldhead> you can safely ignore that
[22:12:00] <coldhead> chrome is making outrageous demands that not even google complies with
[22:12:03] * gf3 pampers coldhead 
[22:12:13] <coldhead> oh sweet death
[22:12:47] <progrock> not a big surprise
[22:13:43] <progrock> its kinda sad, I use to never use 'google.load()' at all since it performed better to include the css or js links the html.. butnow I'm just too lazy and google loader is awesome
[22:14:02] <Cork> coldhead: care to be a bit more specific?
[22:14:29] <coldhead> about my deathwish, Cork?
[22:14:36] <gf3> yes yes
[22:14:36] <folo> hey coldhead
[22:14:38] <gf3> pray tell
[22:14:42] <Cork> no about what chrome does that you don't like
[22:14:46] <folo> need help with the jquery message form
[22:14:52] <folo> i have a snipet online
[22:15:04] <gf3> TAKE IT OFFLINE
[22:15:11] <coldhead> oh i don't care, Cork, it's progrock who cares
[22:15:16] <Cork> i'm noy to found of all chromes rendering bugs either but not sure what your talking about
[22:15:21] <Cork> noy==not
[22:15:30] <coldhead> i think the story is that Google serves fonts with a mime-type that chrome doesn't understand
[22:15:40] <Cork> ah
[22:15:42] <progrock> I'm really confused why the MDC docs has a divide by 0, can anyone explain? https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[22:15:48] <coldhead> and chrome is all like "well i don't like it but i'll work anyway and complain in the console"
[22:16:27] <folo> help i am having a javascript file which need browser refresh
[22:16:31] <coldhead> i haven't really noticed any problems with chrome's rendering but it's only my first day using rendering
[22:16:45] <Cork> coldhead: heh :)
[22:17:14] <Cork> coldhead: i get margin bugs here and there, and helped a guy a few mins ago with a fixed calculation error
[22:17:35] <coldhead> i see nothing about divide by zero on that page, progrock
[22:17:38] <Cork> (margin that isn't drawn until you touch the element with js)
[22:17:52] <coldhead> oh that sounds annoying
[22:18:00] <coldhead> i guess that's more advanced stuff than i do
[22:18:07] <Cork> ya, and it was fixed in chromium in dec...
[22:18:13] <Cork> but chrome still have it >_<'''
[22:18:13] <gf3> progrock: I guess it's shorter than writing Infinity
[22:18:21] <coldhead> i'm basically trying to find clients who want a "Hello World" webpage
[22:18:24] <gf3> progrock: and more expressive I suppose
[22:18:36] <coldhead> then i will outsoruce
[22:18:45] <progrock> gf3: oh, that actually works?... Closure Compiler fucking won't work with that
[22:19:03] <folo> need help with this comment form it needs browser refresh I am looking to get it to post without browser refresh
[22:19:04] <gf3> progrock: try UglifyJS
[22:19:18] <progrock> I'm thinking about trying UglifJS with that.. I could probably set some flag ineither anyway
[22:19:37] <Whirl3d> I use google fonts without any problems in chrome.
[22:20:18] <progrock> Whirl3d: obviously.. but theres a warning message in you console.. at least if you uses google's loader API
[22:20:41] <Whirl3d> hmmm, I wonder why I don't see that?
[22:21:13] <progrock> Google's api's are pretty cool.. minus a minor width calcualationerror tht I can;t figure out, I hooked up translate on a simple website of mine in less than an hour (just fuckign aroudn obviously)

[22:30:07] <folo> before the $post
[22:32:01] <vhec> can you please explain upload a file using jquery ajax
[22:33:02] <coldhead> i don't think that's possible, vhec
[22:33:36] <tdignan> you should consult a book about your server side language/framework
[22:34:02] <coldhead> vhec: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[22:34:09] <coldhead> people seem to like that plugin
[22:34:31] <tdignan> Man I'll add it to my box of goodies
[22:35:02] <tdignan> this is today's find: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[22:35:13] <tdignan> that plugin made my night
[22:35:49] <folo> coldhead here is my fiddle
[22:35:50] <folo> http://jsfiddle.net/47ygj/
[22:36:06] <coldhead> well found, tdignan
[22:36:14] <coldhead> ben alman is a plugin monster
[22:36:17] <coldhead> in a good way
[22:37:08] <vhec> thank you coldhead
[22:37:36] <coldhead> what am i looking at here, folo?
[22:37:49] <folo> this is the form and the jquery I have so far with
[22:37:49] <gf3> you know ;)
[22:38:02] <coldhead> it looks great man, good job
[22:38:06] <folo> not progress in outputing the message without browser refresh
[22:38:12] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/47ygj/1/
[22:38:21] <coldhead> when i type a comment in there, there is no browser refresh
[22:38:28] <folo> so far the form will insert withou broswer refresh and it is toggling great
[22:38:37] <coldhead> yay!
[22:38:39] <coldhead> case cloased!
[22:39:55] <folo> in that space to jam e.preventDefault
[22:39:58] <folo> ok wait
[22:40:06] <folo> i have to get this
[22:40:11] <coldhead> no you don't need prevenDefault there
[22:40:17] <coldhead> i was looking at other code
[22:40:32] <coldhead> because you have not explained very well and i have had to guess
[22:40:44] <coldhead> because to be honest this is filling me with a kind of tired dead feeling
[22:40:48] <coldhead> and i just want it to be over
[22:40:53] <folo> well i you post a edit of my fiddle just with one space of a differences
[22:41:01] <folo> thougth you were suggesting to put that function in there
[22:41:38] <folo> dead feeling somehow it need to be live lol
[22:41:51] <coldhead> well said, my gypsy friend
[22:41:52] <folo> this thing will probably need more coding that what I think
[22:42:03] <folo> what do you suggest coldhead?
[22:42:14] <coldhead> what you have now works on jsfiddle
[22:42:20] <coldhead> it submits to a page
[22:42:24] <coldhead> the problem is the page does not exist
[22:42:25] <folo> don't woirk here man
[22:42:31] <coldhead> but it should be okay on your server
[22:42:34] <coldhead> what doesn't work?
[22:42:41] <folo> go here
[22:42:54] <folo> http://www.nyhungry.com/jqueryform/formjquery.php?category_id=53
[22:42:54] <coldhead> do you have firebug or google developer tools to see whether the AJAX request is occurring?
[22:43:06] <folo> I have firebug
[22:43:10] <folo> how do I realize aobut that
[22:43:12] <folo> tell me about htat one
[22:43:14] <folo> i have firebug
[22:43:17] <coldhead> open the console
[22:43:26] <coldhead> right click and ensure you have XHR LOgging Enabled
[22:43:44] <coldhead> then with the console open trigger the AJAX
[22:44:19] <folo> ok i opended the firebug
[22:44:27] <folo> where do I look for xhr Loggin enable ?
[22:44:37] <coldhead> okay given that i am very bored, let's just try to fix this easily and get on with out lives
[22:45:11] <folo> coldhead
[22:45:13] <coldhead> i think you're messing with the wrong code
[22:45:20] <folo> probably
[22:45:23] <coldhead> see this line: <input id="bringinput" name="submit" type="submit" value="submit" align="left">
[22:45:26] <coldhead> change it to:
[22:45:28] <folo> yes
[22:45:32] <folo> aha
[22:45:39] <coldhead> <input id="bringinput" name="submit" type="button" value="submit" align="left">
[22:45:45] <coldhead> that way it will not submit
[22:45:53] <coldhead> it will just be a button
[22:45:56] <folo> change the type to button
[22:45:57] <folo> ok
[22:45:58] <folo> wiat
[22:45:58] <coldhead> and clicking the button will do the ajax
[22:46:07] <coldhead> and if that works, go have a beer
[22:46:17] <dxgriffiths> folo: http://jsfiddle.net/UvR5s/, a more readable style
[22:47:34] <folo> I am not submiting from that form coldhead I am submiting from the blab form
[22:48:28] <folo> thank you for the edit Dxgriffiths
[22:48:46] <coldhead> i must be looking at the wrong thing

[22:50:22] <folo> Blab away (220 char max)
[22:50:30] <coldhead> and now you are telling me there is another form id="blabh"?
[22:50:31] <folo> yes
[22:50:41] <coldhead> this is hell on earth
[22:51:02] <folo> that id = blab is also name = blab_form
[22:51:14] <folo> has a name of blab_from
[22:51:24] <folo> and a id of blab
[22:52:01] <folo> so is the id or the name that need to be taken in cosideration Sr?

[22:59:49] <coldhead> i mean the thing i said
[23:02:44] <sdio> I'm new to both JS and jQuery, and I suspect my code smells, I'd like to clean it up, to start with.. http://pastie.org/private/q23dz9zv7xwivloodcdtw
[23:02:55] <sdio> How would I do that better?
[23:03:21] <sdio> it seems ugly to me. (I'm a C++ guy, so ugly is relative, but, ugly compared to other jQuery code I've seen ;)).
[23:03:24] <dxgriffiths> sdio: looks.
[23:03:26] <coldhead> dxgriffiths: you got this one? :)
[23:03:31] <coldhead> ah thx <3
[23:03:49] <eml> 'a[id^="expandsomething"]' #expandsomething <- id
[23:04:07] <eml> oh ^=
[23:04:13] <sdio> eml: wouldn't that only match "expandsomething", and not "expandsomething10"?
[23:04:14] <sdio> right.
[23:04:22] <tdignan> well I went from code that didn't work, to code that works perfectly even in IE, 7 hours later..
[23:04:26] <tdignan> time to commit i think
[23:04:29] <coldhead> folo: what's taking so long?
[23:04:35] <folo> waht ?
[23:04:42] <coldhead> i gotta go get chemotherapy soon
[23:04:51] <coldhead> remove the e.preventDefault, bro
[23:04:51] <tdignan> really?
[23:04:57] <coldhead> no of course not really
[23:05:04] <coldhead> but it feel slike it

[23:05:15] <sdio> joking about cancer, the latest rage.
[23:05:27] <coldhead> LINE 32 , FOLO, REMOVE IT
[23:05:35] <tdignan> I had a boss who survived cancer
[23:05:44] <folo> wait
[23:05:47] <tdignan> He sat in a room with 20+ monitors/hdtvs
[23:05:50] <coldhead> i have been joking about cancer before it was cool
[23:05:56] <tdignan> once I jokingly said he should wear a lead vest
[23:06:02] <folo> excuse me coldhead
[23:06:03] <coldhead> hahahah
[23:06:04] <tdignan> "Why, so I don't get cancer.. WHAHAHAHAH"\
[23:06:14] <folo> in the fiddle
[23:06:25] <folo> tell me what line a html line
[23:06:27] <folo> jquery
[23:06:30] <folo> or php
[23:06:55] <folo> coldhead don't know where
[23:06:56] <tdignan> man you should try to separate your jquery/javascript bugs from your php bugs
[23:07:27] <sdio> for further context, expandsomething(id) creates the div#moresomethingX and populates it using ajax, i'm passing it the entire id, so I can just look up the .parent() to do my insertion of the div into.
[23:07:35] <sdio> (rather than just passing it rid)
[23:08:06] <Trisox[work]> coldhead
[23:08:12] <Trisox[work]> drinking beers again?
[23:08:30] <sdio> I've got around five expanding items for each div, so the code is really bugging me :).

[23:09:04] <folo> lol
[23:09:05] <coldhead> REMOVE IT
[23:09:07] <coldhead> FROM THE LIVE SERVER
[23:09:09] <folo> I don't have that line in the code
[23:09:13] <coldhead> AND MAYBE I WILL LET YOU LIVE
[23:09:17] <coldhead> oh for fuck's sake
[23:09:22] <folo> yes
[23:09:22] <dxgriffiths> sodhi: Make sure you always put var in front of variables you use inside a function... id = $(this).attr('id'); can become var id = this.id;
[23:09:29] <folo> really i don't have it
[23:09:32] <folo> let me go over
[23:09:33] <folo> again
[23:09:36] <dxgriffiths> Sorry sodhi, that was meant for sdio.
[23:09:40] <folo> just to make sure
[23:09:46] <coldhead> it is still on the server, folo
[23:09:51] <coldhead> we're talking about nyhungry
[23:09:56] <coldhead> forget jsfiddle
[23:09:58] <coldhead> it's no use
[23:10:07] <sdio> dxgriffiths: right, gotcha.

[23:10:36] <coldhead> thank you so much, folo
[23:10:36] <sdio> dxgriffiths: anything else?
[23:10:39] <coldhead> you are a saint
[23:10:41] <folo> my bad i don;t know how you knew but it was there sr
[23:10:45] <coldhead> a moutj-breathing saint
[23:11:01] <folo> what the f is moutj=breathing
[23:11:03] <dxgriffiths> Also sdio, you can make it $('a[id^="expandsomething"], a[id^="expandsomeotherthing"]') and just have one click function.
[23:11:03] <folo> saint
[23:11:43] <coldhead> never mind, folo
[23:12:15] <folo> how can i private through here
[23:12:17] <folo> ?
[23:12:19] <dxgriffiths> sdio: also, I wouldn't return false from a click handler unless you really, really mean it.
[23:14:09] <folo> what line number two was suposed to do let me check that
[23:14:21] <sdio> dxgriffiths: if I made them one click function, I'd haveto check which function to invoke + which div to collapse within the function anyway, so i'd haveto run through all the possibilties. It does make it slightly more compact, though.
[23:15:13] <coldhead> OH MY SWEET LORD HE FUCKING QUIT
[23:15:22] <coldhead> i am going to take down his server
[23:15:38] <sdio> well, I must say, you did seem to be screaming at him an awful lot.
[23:15:57] <coldhead> you should see his code
[23:16:14] <coldhead> sup folo
[23:16:19] <folo> the whole browser shut off on lme
[23:16:25] <folo> yes coldhead
[23:16:28] <dxgriffiths> lol @ coldhead
[23:16:30] <coldhead> yes it must have been very traumatic for you
[23:16:38] <folo> the whole browswer got dirty on me shut off
[23:16:45] <folo> o man
[23:16:48] <folo> let me tell you
[23:16:48] <sdio> it did? poor wittle you.
[23:16:52] <coldhead> okay folo http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/394691/394684/
[23:17:00] <folo> this fucking code is just everything but aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[23:17:00] <coldhead> we need you to add that console.log line
[23:17:09] <coldhead> that's very well said
[23:17:11] <folo> why the console line
[23:17:14] <coldhead> it's very aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[23:17:19] <coldhead> don't ask, just do
[23:17:23] <coldhead> i will castrate you
[23:17:23] <folo> man
[23:17:31] <dxgriffiths> sdio: sorry those functions looked identical at first glance.
[23:17:34] <coldhead> we need to get through this
[23:17:40] <coldhead> this is our own private 9/11
[23:17:43] <sdio> dxgriffiths: that's what's annoying.
[23:17:56] <folo> shit it is highlighted and everything
[23:18:04] <sdio> dxgriffiths: but it looks like I'll have to live with it for now.
[23:18:04] <folo> man I heard the world is ending soon
[23:18:12] <coldhead> it certainly feels like it
[23:18:17] <coldhead> it will be a relief
[23:18:26] <dxgriffiths> sdio: you can redesign your code a bit so it doesn't have that repetition.
[23:18:41] <coldhead> thank you folo!
[23:18:41] <tdignan> things are going strangely well for me lately
[23:18:44] <tdignan> so it must be ending
[23:18:56] <folo> really that's on the news
[23:19:05] <folo> i am not jucking plus all this fucking volcanos
[23:19:23] <sdio> dxgriffiths: do tell? I assume create a function to handle the changing of the text, and collapsing of the div by passing a div to collapse if the text is '[-]', and a function to call with the id of the div otherwise?
[23:19:34] <mattems> hey all
[23:19:48] <dxgriffiths> "plus all this fucking volcanos" is the quote of the week.
[23:19:51] <mattems> should this work: $('#projects .project-items li:not(.active)').click(function(e) {});
[23:20:20] <sdio> dxgriffiths: that would work. then I could just do togglefn(this, functiontocall, divtocollapse) which handles it?
[23:20:38] <anli_> $('.icelandic.volcanos:active').length > 0
[23:20:39] <dxgriffiths> sdio: well, is each div going to collapse/expand a single thing or is it going to change over time?
[23:20:58] <sdio> each is going to collapse a single thing.
[23:21:12] <folo> did't go throught the operation
[23:21:47] <folo> send an ambulance
[23:22:39] <tdignan> honest opinion needed: what do you think of the domain "knowzie.com"
[23:22:53] <dxgriffiths> sdio: in that case I'd consider just hardcoding an onlick = "collapse(divtocollapse)" instead.
[23:24:50] <sdio> dxgriffiths: that'd work too.
[23:25:06] <coldhead> folo: i don't think the HTML the server is sending back has anything with id="messageoutput"
[23:25:54] <folo> yes
[23:25:55] <dxgriffiths> sdio: if you want to go the soft route, then maybe have a data-target attribute set with the id of the matching div, and then refer to that in your click handler.
[23:25:56] <folo> i think so
[23:26:08] <folo> i am not specifying where I will send the data
[23:26:18] <folo> and the messageoutput is the div where the data goes
[23:26:46] <coldhead> folo: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/394694/394684/
[23:26:48] <coldhead> try that
[23:27:01] <coldhead> tell me if that updates the page when you submit
[23:27:04] <folo> my bad is the blabla that the div
[23:27:04] <sdio> dxgriffiths: 'data-target attribute'?
[23:27:10] <coldhead> i know it is the wrong data but that is something that is in there
[23:27:13] <folo> let me see
[23:27:20] <folo> what ?
[23:27:25] <folo> what you have just edit?
[23:27:26] <coldhead> you have literally the worst markup i have seen in here for months
[23:27:35] <folo> #linkcity
[23:27:36] <dxgriffiths> Yeah, like <input type="button" data-target="somedivID">
[23:27:39] <coldhead> instead of a doctype your HTML opens with
[23:27:40] <coldhead> <tr>
[23:27:41] <sebz> hi, wondering if anyone know where I could download a jquery tee shirt builder type script?
[23:27:46] <coldhead> i am not even kkidding
[23:27:50] <folo> hahaha
[23:27:54] <folo> not
[23:28:06] <folo> wait let me see that
[23:28:09] <folo> it has a doc type
[23:28:12] <dxgriffiths> sdio: then in the click handler it's like $($(this).data("target")).hide()
[23:28:29] <coldhead> FORGET ABOUT THE DOCTUPE
[23:28:32] <sdio> dxgriffiths: heh, that's awesome.
[23:28:32] <coldhead> try changing #blahbla to #linkcity in the post request
[23:28:36] <coldhead> as i showed in the paste
[23:28:43] <coldhead> just to see if ANYTHING can work
[23:28:44] <sdio> dxgriffiths: did not know about that.
[23:29:23] <folo> ok
[23:29:45] <coldhead> thanks folo
[23:29:48] <folo> wiat
[23:31:04] <folo> $.post($('#linkcity').attr("action"),
[23:31:07] <folo> you mean that
[23:31:08] <folo> ?
[23:31:11] <coldhead> no
[23:31:19] <folo> where in the form ?
[23:31:22] <coldhead> what you did was right
[23:31:28] <coldhead> JUST LEAVE IT A MINUTE
[23:31:55] <folo> you mean this is right
[23:31:56] <folo> $.post($('#linkcity').attr("action"),
[23:32:10] <coldhead> NO I DO NOT
[23:32:23] <folo> you mean in the post request?
[23:32:26] <folo> where is the post request?
[23:32:41] <coldhead> omg lol
[23:32:43] <folo> dumb questino but I have to ask it
[23:32:49] <coldhead> i am in tears here
[23:32:51] <folo> don't know if you mean the form
[23:32:57] <folo> or the jquery
[23:32:58] <folo> man
[23:33:04] <coldhead> i pasted you a link
[23:33:11] <folo> yes
[23:33:14] <coldhead> that showed you exactly what to change and where
[23:33:20] <folo> ok
[23:33:24] <folo> I will just paste it
[23:33:26] <dxgriffiths> This is breaking my heart!!
[23:33:27] <coldhead> but forget about it
[23:33:42] <folo> take the console.log?
[23:33:43] <folo> out
[23:33:46] <Kocho> hey everyone, how do you achieve this stuck nav effect? http://www.blackestate.co.nz/
[23:33:52] <coldhead> yes take it out
[23:34:48] <coldhead> folo: when i view the HTML source to your page, the first thing i see is http://paste.pocoo.org/show/394699/
[23:35:11] <coldhead> can you get rid of that so we can make sure it isn't fucking things up?
[23:35:15] <coldhead> it should not be there
[23:35:30] <sdio> dxgriffiths: what's up with the double $$? $($(this).data("target")).hide() vs $(this).data('target').hide()? some scoping stuff that I don't know?
[23:35:32] <folo> what the page you are in ?
[23:35:41] <coldhead> view-source:http://www.nyhungry.com/jqueryform/formjquery.php?category_id=66
[23:35:42] <folo> i just want to make sure you are in the same one I am
[23:35:52] <dxgriffiths> Kocho: it's at the bottom of http://www.blackestate.co.nz/media/j/behaviour.js
[23:35:52] <folo> ok view sour ce
[23:35:54] <folo> ok wiat
[23:36:09] <coldhead> i am having a nosebleed
[23:36:11] <folo> upps
[23:36:17] <folo> that's fuck up
[23:36:20] <folo> let me get rid of that
[23:36:25] <dxgriffiths> sdio: data('target') would just give you a string.. not a live reference to the object. You have to loop it back through jQuery as a selector.
[23:36:29] <Kocho> dxgriffiths: oh thanks, does this effect have a nav?
[23:36:34] <Kocho> name*
[23:36:53] <Kocho> i sort of want to follow a tutorial of some sort
[23:37:05] <dxgriffiths> Kocho: I think it's just called "kind of annoying stuck nav effect" ;)
[23:37:10] <sdio> dxgriffiths: ah, of course.
[23:37:46] <coldhead> thanks folo
[23:37:47] <dxgriffiths> sdio: in my example I forgot to put a # on the data-target string, you'd need that.
[23:37:55] <dxgriffiths> Kocho: seriously, though I don't know.
[23:38:04] <Kocho> dxgriffiths: ok then thanks
[23:38:06] <coldhead> i'm listening to sterolab's chemical chords now and it's making me less suicidal
[23:38:52] <coldhead> folo you need to get rid of all that crap, the <DOCTYPE needs to come first
[23:38:55] <coldhead> hi mcluskydodallas
[23:39:09] <coldhead> thanks folo
[23:39:20] <dxgriffiths> Kocho: try "floating menu jquery"
[23:39:48] <coldhead> folo: you now have a line that says
[23:39:58] <coldhead> 8  var comment = $(html) .find('#linkcity').html();
[23:40:02] <coldhead> get rid of the
[23:40:05] <coldhead> 8
[23:40:15] <coldhead> i cannot believe how badly this is going
[23:40:17] <Kocho> dxgriffiths: ahh beautiful, got some results... thank you!
[23:40:34] <coldhead> sorry kids i'm just going to PM folo and take the bullet in private
[23:40:46] <dxgriffiths> coldhead: many thanks.
[23:41:31] <folo> yes
[23:41:58] <folo> Man I still fighting with this
[23:42:02] <folo> doc tyhpe
[23:44:43] <sdio> dxgriffiths: this is what I went with (it works), http://pastie.org/private/jafsktgywcunkdamktlq
[23:44:52] <coldhead> >: |
[23:44:57] <sdio> I think that's way cleaner than what I had before, hope you agree?
[23:47:19] <Jester831> anyone know a good jquery hover image lightboxer
[23:47:29] <Jester831> yes, hover, not click (I know, how awful)
[23:48:28] <dxgriffiths> sdio: looks much better.
[23:48:42] <sdio> dxgriffiths: thank you for your help :).
[23:53:25] <dxgriffiths> sdio: no problem :) I'm also in #jsmentors if you ever want to drop in.
[23:54:23] <Lunders> good morning friends :) for some reason if you click refund turn, then click the X in the top corner ... it starts a loop for refunding turns .... any way of fixing this? http://lundy.me.uk/GFA/details.php?s=1&t=67466109ab53a17a111103b0551dc01a&CustomerID=1
