[00:00:07] <DocNasty> don, i'm up, but i don't know anything about extended properties
[00:00:18] <donCams> hi Zogot... can you tell me why line 20 is not merging my objects? http://pastebin.com/1TtwtWey
[00:00:23] <donCams> hmmm
[00:01:29] <Zogot> Sorry donCams, a little out of my knowledge also
[00:01:46] <DocNasty> can anyone point me to a good example on how to pull servername out of this json?  http://tinyurl.com/837r3vy
[00:05:48] <peol> DocNasty: I guess you mean by using some jQuery method, do $.getJSON('URL HERE', function(data) {console.log(data.results.servername);});
[00:06:21] <peol> DocNasty: But you should ideally also check to see if you have any data.results before when parsing it
[00:06:40] <DocNasty> Thanks peol, I'll explore that.. I'm trying something new with json, since I've hit a roadblock with xml
[00:12:38] <Aciid> hey, is it a new standard to do selections with jQuery(...
[00:12:54] <Aciid> since I have found some deprecation and mismatch in my scripts that have both $ and jQuery
[00:13:15] <Zogot> It might be there for noconflict mode?
[00:13:21] <IvanKuzev> $ is kjust for shorthand
[00:13:47] <Aciid> yea I have nonconflict mode activated and developing scripts on top of drupal
[00:14:15] <ParadoxQuine> hey guys, quick question: if i'm using on for multiple events and delegation, would i do $("#thing").on({mapObjectFields&Functions}, delegateSelector); ?
[00:30:45] <donCams> woot. solved my problem. apparently, it has something to do with ajax :)
[00:31:28] <donCams> changed it to http://pastebin.com/FhZbnkZm
[00:32:17] <gnarf> Aciid: you can use a closure to rename jQuery to $ safely
[00:32:30] <gnarf> Aciid: (function($){ })(jQuery);
[00:33:04] <gnarf> Aciid: also, if you happen to be within a document ready function "jQuery" itself is passed as the first argument
[00:33:16] <gnarf> so you can jQuery( function($) { }); too and use the $ safely
[00:33:26] <donCams> yey... self-invoking function!
[00:34:36] <DukeDrake> o
[00:35:26] <codehotter> closures.. oh heavens, they are so beautiful. I have fallen in love.
[00:36:12] <donCams> same... we're going to get married next week. my sweet, little closures
[00:36:31] <Aciid> gnarf: jesus so this script's original writer was wrong
[00:36:48] <gnarf> Aciid: there is nothing wrong with using "jQuery"
[00:37:01] <gnarf> it just doesn't compress as well in a minifier unless you have it scoped
[00:37:02] <gnarf> :)
[00:37:16] <gnarf> but gzip takes care of most of that difference anyway
[00:37:33] <gnarf> jQuery source for instance always references jQuery and not $
[00:37:54] <gnarf> but jQuery UI almost exclusively uses $ instead of jQuery (with the closure)
[00:40:03] <IvanKuzev> gnarf : does it have to use jQuery instead?
[00:40:24] <edgardo> hello all
[00:40:43] <edgardo> hi IvanKuzev
[00:40:49] <gnarf> IvanKuzev: ?
[00:41:30] <gnarf> ask quick, cuz i wanna sleep ;)
[00:41:47] <ang_> Hi all I've a piece of code that isn't working as expected, for anyone able/willing to help out I set it up as an example in fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mrc3C/8/
[00:42:10] <IvanKuzev> oh..nevermind...i need to look more into it before asking
[00:42:21] <ang_> I'm using jEditable and it's just that the text is lost when I go into edit mode
[00:42:24] <gnarf> ang_: holy shit - ton of code
[00:43:24] <ang_> gnarf it's really not very intimidating. Half of it is just setting up tinyMCE or jEditable
[00:43:29] <gnarf> ang_: so like the tinyMCE is going to have some function to set data / create an editor
[00:43:49] <IvanKuzev> maybe tonight....(its morning now)...i will be more helpfull
[00:43:55] <gnarf> and i think tinyMCE expects a textarea
[00:44:18] <ang_> normally it does, but through the settings you can get it to work on a div as I have
[00:44:49] <ang_> that's from mode: "none/textarea/exact"
[00:45:55] <gnarf> ang_: well either way your using 2 plugins i've never used
[00:46:13] <GolF> hi,Who had ever query Countdown?
[00:47:10] <ang_> hmm that stings
[00:47:34] <GolF> I want to second show 2 digit
[00:47:56] <gnarf> ang_: why not try turning it into a textarea first in that jEditable setup and see if you have better luck with that
[00:49:19] <GolF> jquery Countdown ,show time 10:10:9 but I want to show 10:10:09, How do.
[00:50:19] <ang_> hmm let me try that gnarf
[00:51:25] <gnarf> anyway - im outta here
[00:51:40] <gnarf> ?glwt @ang_
[00:51:41] <bot-t> ang_, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[00:52:01] <ang_> lol ok
[00:53:22] <shomon> hi, I'd like to add validation for a correct entry of an email address.
[00:53:41] <shomon> but I'm quite new to jquery. it's already used to validate other things on the page, so do I need a separate library or anything to include this function?
[00:53:52] <shomon> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/email this one I mean
[00:57:08] <edgardo> shomon, make the input fiel "email" and make it required -> no stressful validation :)
[00:57:15] <edgardo> field*
[01:02:32] <shomon> edgardo, the line currently says: <input type="text" name="email" value="the email" size="20">
[01:02:36] <shomon> how do I make it required
[01:05:16] <edgardo> <input type="email" name="whatever" id="if_you_need_one" size="20" required />
[01:06:13] <edgardo> there is also <input type="url" name="whatever" id="if_you_need_one" required /> if you need an url.. it's required with http:// in the beginning
[01:06:26] <shomon> aah thanks, and whatever type of jquery is loaded it should work... will try
[01:07:53] <edgardo> no jquery needed, it's just plain html.. test it out :)
[01:08:54] <edgardo> however, the "please fill in a correct e-mail" or whatever it says, looks different in all browsers.. but it's easy validation if you don't want to pull your hair out of your head :D
[01:08:58] <shomon> no change at all
[01:09:16] <shomon> hmm
[01:10:07] <edgardo> should work, it's only basic html
[01:11:42] <shomon> I can't see how basic html is supposed to validate that a piece of text contains an @ and a . in the right order
[01:11:52] <shomon> normally to validate that in code it takes a little function at least...
[01:12:29] <shomon> and you have to tell it to return the same form if there's an error...  I will try and see how else to implement that email validation function
[01:12:53] <edgardo> shomon, http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/g36mQ/
[01:13:23] <edgardo> in it's simplest form
[01:15:07] <edgardo> that just won't let you proceed unless it sees a valid e-mail address
[01:15:20] <shomon> but that needs some library loaded
[01:15:23] <shomon> ?
[01:16:11] <shomon> I can't understand it. sorry
[01:16:46] <edgardo> no, it's JUST html
[01:16:58] <edgardo> the browser validates it
[01:18:27] <shomon> but why not use this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/email
[01:18:50] <shomon> I can't understand that html - maybe some html 5 browsers validate it.
[01:19:04] <shomon> I mean I can't understand how to make that work in my web app
[01:19:59] <walid> shomon: html5 indeed
[01:22:10] <edgardo> if you want to validate it in php/jquery you'd need regular expression then
[01:23:06] <edgardo> I'm not sure how jquery's validate works, I know regexp works
[01:24:44] <shomon> yeah I could do a regexp but I wanted to make it easier for them by just showing as they type the form, that the email is right or not
[01:25:11] <edgardo> did you give jquery's validate a shot?
[01:25:13] <shomon> I'm trying to include the "validate" method in the view bit
[01:25:28] <blackspotwiggins> shomon, in the half hour you have chatted about it, you could have written a serverside validation(which you need anyway) and used html5 input types and already be done with it
[01:25:30] <deanclkclk> anyone here works with JQuery and Joomla?
[01:26:22] <xec> ?ask @ deanclkclk
[01:26:22] <bot-t> deanclkclk, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:27:54] <DocNasty> Morning.  I'm using YQL to return json, and i'm trying ot parse it with JQuery.  The data returned looks like this:  "cbfunc({"query":{"count":1,"created":"2011-12-12T09:06:14Z","lang":"en-US","results":{"activesong":{"servername":"NonStop Rock on Krushradio.com","mount":"switch","servergenre":"Various","serverbitrate":"96","sID":"6110","songname":"Hoobastank - Inside of You","listnercount":"2"}}}});"
[01:27:57] <deanclkclk> ok...I wanted to use the accordian plugin with a component I'm building
[01:28:30] <DocNasty> I'm getting an error in jquery when i try to use : data.query.results.servername to pull out the servername
[01:28:50] <DocNasty> The error is a parse JSON error.. any thoughts?
[01:29:13] <blackspotwiggins> DocNasty, you are getting jsonp
[01:29:14] <shomon> blackspotwiggins, thanks I just found out about html 5 input types.. interesting, and may be easier...
[01:29:20] <blackspotwiggins> not plain json
[01:29:32] <DocNasty> so, change my dataType to jsonp then?
[01:30:29] <AdvoWork> If I have a select field, with id/name of product_types  and im using Jquery to insert a new record into the database, how can I reload that field? because that field is dynamically populated via php, in terms of: <select> PHP for each .... <option>$row['phpstuff'];</option> type of thing..
[01:30:44] <DocNasty> thanks blackpotwiggins  I'll search some examples on jquery.com for the jsonp examples.. Thanks a bunch.
[01:30:51] <deanclkclk> wanted to know if I should load the jquery.ui.widget.js and the query.ui.accordion.js?
[01:32:18] <IvanKuzev> deanclkclk: yeah and jquery.ui.core too
[01:34:42] <deanclkclk> ok thanks IvanKuzev
[01:35:03] <shomon> is there a good guide to input types? - changing the kind of popup they create for example?
[01:35:12] <AdvoWork> whats the best way to add an option to a select field via jquery? I see many different examples, but dunno which is best
[01:35:44] <edgardo> shomon, if you use the html5 input types the popup is browser based.. it will look different on all browsers
[01:36:18] <edgardo> if you use jquery you can customize an error-box on the page with css if you want
[01:38:22] <shomon> thanks edgardo
[01:39:16] <ravenzz> shomon if you don't need to alt the execution of the script you could override the native functions like alert prompt and so on
[01:40:56] <shomon> do you mean if I don't need to halt the execution?
[01:41:22] <ravenzz> yes typo
[01:43:25] <Kingsy> can someone help me debug something in ie7 ? I really cant figure out why its not working
[01:46:22] <IvanKuzev> sorry . dont have ie7
[01:46:55] <johnline3> sorry, i dont have aids
[01:47:26] <xec> johnline3: and you're sorry about the fact?
[01:47:29] <xec> ^^
[01:47:31] <johnline3> :v
[01:47:32] <Kingsy> IvanKuzev, np..
[01:47:39] <Kingsy> anyone have IE7 and a little time? :)
[01:48:01] <shomon> Kingsy, have you tried with that firebug lite type thing in IE?
[01:48:11] <Kingsy> shomon, yeah
[01:48:17] <shomon> can't remember what it's called, but you can debug a little in there...
[01:48:19] <shomon> ah well sorry
[01:48:19] <Kingsy> I have tried pretty much everything I can think of
[01:48:30] <Kingsy> so I was hoping for some "expert" eyes
[01:48:39] <shomon> there's always "shitty browsers not supported" t-shirts...
[01:48:48] <Kingsy> lol
[01:48:58] <xec> oh god, i want one
[01:49:32] <xec> Kingsy: force google chrome frame on your users ;)
[01:50:26] <Kingsy> xec: kinda just wanna fix the problem :P
[01:50:43] <xec> well, that would fix the issue, i'm betting
[01:51:23] <Kingsy> yeah it would, but not really a viable solution for me
[01:52:19] <AdvoWork> is there a way I can reload a div without specifying the actual content of it? $('#otherdiv').load('urlofpagewith info.php'); i dont want to have to specify the content really
[01:54:21] <fris> then use $('#otherdiv').load('info.php');
[01:55:25] <AdvoWork> fris, do i have to specify info.php though?  because the page this is on, is a page loaded by jquery, meaning the page its on (whatecvercontroller?action=whatever if i reload that, it will load a different page
[01:59:21] <jbooker> Hi all. I have successfully got tabs loading content via AJAX (I'm a newb - this is an achievement!) and also following links by reloading the tab instead of reloading the whole page. However, the titles in the tabs don't automagically change with the content, i know i'll need to add some handling into the 'load' option of the tab options, but i'm not sure how I can re-apply the tab template to the header - any ideas?
[02:02:14] <AdvoWork> any ideas fris ?
[02:03:24] <risky_s> any filezilla users here?
[02:03:50] <Kingsy> can someone maybe look into my IE7 issue?
[02:04:09] <Kingsy> I am stumpted
[02:04:41] <gosrt> Hi.
[02:04:51] <xec> Kingsy: maybe people will get more intrigued if you state/demonstrate the issue
[02:05:02] <gosrt> How to set the zIndex via .css(). This didnt work:  img.css({ top: (e.pageY + 15) + "px", left: (e.pageX + 15) + "px", 'zIndex': (e.pageY + 15) + "px" });
[02:05:49] <gosrt> img.css({ 'zIndex': variableX  +  "px" });
[02:05:59] <xec> px?
[02:06:13] <gosrt> argv ;D thanks
[02:06:56] <AdvoWork> is there no way I can reload a div called #product_types without specifying a page to get the contents from? I know $('#product_types').load('info.php'); exists, but info.php is irrelevant, is there a function I can use that will exclude that url?
[02:07:07] <Kingsy> xec: sorry will do
[02:08:49] <xec> AdvoWork: a div does not know where its contents came from, there is no way to "reload" a div, so to speak
[02:10:01] <AdvoWork> xec, the thing is, my div is being populated with php, ie html Php to show the data(populate the select form and options), and im adding a record with another function, i want it to now see that option. Any ideas please?
[02:10:19] <jbooker> Hi all. I have successfully got tabs loading content via AJAX (I'm a newb - this is an achievement!) and also following links by reloading the tab instead of reloading the whole page. However, the titles in the tabs don't automagically change with the content, i know i'll need to add some handling into the 'load' option of the tab options, but i'm not sure how I can re-apply the tab template to the header - any ideas?
[02:10:40] <Kingsy> ok check this out --> http://www.giftedjewelry.com/56565.html <-- go on that page on FF and IE7, you can see its fine in firefox (the carousel at the bottom of the page) load it up in IE7 however and the height is totally crazy. it also has a populated carousel but you cant see any products due to the incorrect widths. anyone know why this is happenin?
[02:11:37] <Kingsy> what makes it even more confusing is this is a direct copy of the site --> http://www.qpjewellers.com/16565.html <-- same product etc and it works in IE7, as far as I can see the code is the same on both sites but the error only occurs on the first site.
[02:11:42] <Cork> jbooker: window.title = "new title";
[02:12:14] <Kingsy> if anyone has an idea it would be much appreciated.
[02:13:01] <jbooker> Cork - that will change the browser window title. I want to change the title of the *tab*
[02:13:27] <jbooker> and also, I don't know how to retrieve the content of the <title> tab from the newly-fetched page
[02:13:37] <Cork> jbooker: you mean a jquery tab?
[02:13:40] <xec> AdvoWork: i'm not sure i get what you mean - you have a static (on client side) form, with a select - and you add an option to it using javascript?
[02:14:10] <jbooker> Cork: yes. in the jquery-ui tabs plugin
[02:15:08] <jbooker> Cork: It's all working, i can dynamically add new tabs, and when i click i link in the tab, it loads the new page in the tab, rather than the whole browser. but the title of the tab doesn't change, and I'm not sure how to change it or how to retrieve it from the page
[02:15:10] <AdvoWork> xec, i've basically got a div, inside of that i have a select field, but all the options on there are populated via php(i have a php for each loop running which is basically adding each of the options) so when I add a new option with jquery(passes to a php file which inserts into database) i just want to reload the div, thus repopulating the select options. get me?
[02:16:27] <xec> AdvoWork: aha, i think i'm getting closer, yes... do your php file generate the entire page or just the select html?
[02:16:50] <jbooker> AdvoWork: you're probably not going to want to hear this, but there are books on sitepoint.com (including ebooks you can read NOW) which cover exactly what you're doing in great detail, and explain the WHY as well as the HOW
[02:17:39] <Cork> jbooker: you prob need to access the tabs content and replace it
[02:18:27] <Cork> jbooker: $tabs.find('.ui-tabs-nav li').eq(0).html('new tab label')
[02:18:50] <jbooker> Cork: understood. I can manipulate the DOM, I'm fine with that, I'm more interested in how to retreive the title from the HTML document the AJAX request pulled, so i can put it into the tab header
[02:19:17] <Cork> jbooker: you shouldn't even get a full html page through ajax
[02:19:38] <jbooker> Cork: but a title tag will be returned in the <head> section
[02:20:03] <Cork> jbooker: ajax should only have the new elements you want to add
[02:20:14] <xec> jbooker: do you have iframes for each tab or?
[02:20:14] <Cork> not the body, header, html or doctype tags
[02:20:28] <AdvoWork> xec, heres the example: http://pastebin.com/TwQZPBQY
[02:20:40] <jbooker> Cork: now i'm not sure what cakephp is returning, i always assumed it was a full html page, just without my layout divs
[02:20:58] <jbooker> xec: i have whatever the default jquery gives me when using the ajax load option
[02:20:58] <Cork> jbooker: most likly no
[02:21:11] <xro> Hi, what is the right way to remove a trailing / in a string if it exists?
[02:21:20] <jbooker> i wonder if chrome's developer tools will show me
[02:21:25] <jbooker> xro - regular expresions
[02:21:42] <Cork> xro: .replace(/\/$/, '')
[02:22:06] <xro> ohh, ok replace with a regex matching / and end of string... good...
[02:22:13] <xro> thanks!
[02:23:26] <xec> AdvoWork: that really doesnt help much, or answer my question
[02:23:53] <jbooker> Cork: you're right, cakephp is just giving me contents, no <head> or <body> in site.
[02:24:14] <Cork> jbooker: simplest solution is to put the title in a hidden div with an id
[02:24:25] <Cork> then all you need to do is grab the content and show it
[02:24:31] <Cork> opps, no not id
[02:24:38] <Cork> it should prob be a class
[02:24:52] <jbooker> Cork: how about if I title EVERY link within my system, then change the tab title to that anchor tag's title before loading the content?
[02:25:15] <jbooker> Cork: I can easily change my cakephp code to add titles to everything
[02:25:21] <Cork> doable, might be harder to work with though
[02:26:00] <jbooker> i will take a look, thanks for your help Cork
[02:26:21] <Cork> np
[02:31:03] <AdvoWork> xec, any ideas?
[02:33:03] <Kingsy> can anyone take a look at my issue?
[02:39:26] <DukeDrake> hi
[02:39:59] <shomon> hmm I used html types for a form, quite happy with it but the form doesn't send anything into the $_POST variable back in php... is there a good channel to go to find out how to debug this kind of thing, or can I ask this kind of thing here?
[02:40:36] <DukeDrake> shomon: mh ... ##php  ?
[02:40:51] <DukeDrake> How can I manually trigger the 'drop down' of a drop down list?
[02:42:19] <shomon> ok thanks
[02:43:18] <xro> Hi, is there a simple way to encode a string in base64 with jquery?
[02:44:03] <xro> I found something but it needs to add a lib...
[02:44:10] <RLa> shomon, use something like firebug to inspect http requests from browser
[02:44:47] <shomon> thanks RLa I am but it's not reporting anything wrong with the form...
[02:44:48] <xro> httpfox is a good way to inspect http request.... simple and efficient
[02:45:15] <ravenzz> xro https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.btoa
[02:45:18] <DukeDrake> anyone know how to show() the list of a dropdown?
[02:45:21] <RLa> shomon, see what data it sends to ws
[02:45:42] <shomon> I'm making a little jsfiddle...
[02:45:44] <RLa> it should show which post variables/fields are sent
[02:47:39] <ravenzz> xro but it won't work on IE iirc
[02:49:05] <Cork> xro: i think there should be a javascript library laying around
[02:49:10] <AdvoWork> if im doing $.post("test.php", function(data) {  alert("Data Loaded: " + data); });  where would i specify the datatype?
[02:49:45] <ravenzz> Cork yep there is, but he was looking for a native function
[02:50:54] <RLa> AdvoWork, in response's ContentType
[02:51:30] <jbooker> Hi all, more jquery tab help. why is the load event only fired for an initial load of tab content via ajax? i'm successfully loading contents of clicked links using the load callback, but then the load event isn't fired next time.
[02:56:31] <jbooker> can anyone help with jquery tabs?
[02:58:27] <edgardo> what would be a simplest way to disable scrolling when I open a modal-like window? overflow:hidden; won't work in my case because it hides the scrollbar alltogether and pushes the whole site to the side ..
[02:59:23] <DukeDrake> $("#myselect option").show() doesn't work >.>
[02:59:51] <edgardo> what are you trying to achieve?
[03:00:03] <RLa> edgardo, why would you need to disable scrolling?
[03:00:24] <DukeDrake> edgardo: show the list of a select when I click a button
[03:00:32] <DukeDrake> s/when/if
[03:00:52] <jbooker> DukeDrake: you're trying to make individual list options appear or disappear?
[03:01:06] <DukeDrake> no, just the whole list should show up
[03:01:27] <edgardo> isn't that select then?
[03:01:28] <jbooker> DukeDrake: it is invisible to start with? if so $("#myselect").show() should work
[03:01:30] <DukeDrake> i.e. what happens if you click the select
[03:01:48] <DukeDrake> but I want to trigger this by clicking a button
[03:01:52] <jbooker> DukeDrake: you mean you want to click a button, and the select menu drops out as if you clicked the down arrow button?
[03:02:01] <DukeDrake> yupp
[03:02:26] <jbooker> DukeDrake: can you not just do $("#myselect").click()
[03:02:55] <DukeDrake> jbooker: errr ...
[03:03:08] <DukeDrake> jbooker: this would add an event listener, no?
[03:03:14] <edgardo> RLa, because I have an overlay over the page that has height 100%, but it only covers the current screen
[03:03:34] <edgardo> if you scroll you see an ugly edge
[03:03:46] <jbooker> DukeDrake: maybe. bear with me
[03:03:50] <RLa> what if overlay has fixed position?
[03:03:56] <jbooker> DukeDrake: i'm a bit of a noob :D
[03:04:18] <RLa> then it wouldn't be affected by scrolling, does it?
[03:04:38] <DukeDrake> jbooker: no worries, I'm thankful for any hint ^^
[03:04:54] <DukeDrake> trying to show() the options was a mere guess, too =)
[03:04:58] <edgardo> RLa, yeah that works better.. I had it at absolute :)
[03:05:32] <jbooker> DukeDrake: from http://api.jquery.com/click/ - Description: Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
[03:05:44] <jbooker> DukeDrake: i.e. if you do .click() it will trigger it, rather than define it
[03:06:18] <DukeDrake> ah! Heh ^^
[03:06:36] * DukeDrake is still beginner too I guess
[03:07:51] <sasori> if I'll echo something at the php side., it serves as the "data" in the success param of jquery's ajax...what if I "return $var" on php side, will the success param of jquery's ajax treat that a data too ?
[03:08:29] <IvanKuzev> you will get the value of $var
[03:09:10] <IvanKuzev> oh..if you type echo "return $var" then you will get 'return something'
[03:09:20] <jbooker> DukeDrake: just tested it, and it still doesn't work
[03:09:59] <DukeDrake> jbooker: hmm .. it triggers the click event ... but it's not enough! =)
[03:10:44] <sasori> IvanKuzev: tnx
[03:10:46] <jbooker> DukeDrake: seems not.
[03:11:16] <DukeDrake> jbooker: I also tried focus() without success
[03:13:45] <DukeDrake> ok, seems it's simply not possible ^^
[03:13:46] <jbooker> DukeDrake: what you need is a focus() followed by a keydown() as if you'd tabbed to it, then presed the down arrow?
[03:14:23] <jbooker> DukeDrake: hmm, can't focus a select. that's interesting.
[03:14:27] <edgardo> RLa, well it wasn't seamless.. because I'm not covering the whole page with the overlay.. I start at top: 120px
[03:14:41] <edgardo> then when I scroll it becomes transparent at the top for a moment :)
[03:15:37] <DukeDrake> jbooker: well the focus from my button is gone, hence I guess the select is focused ... but the liest-drop doesn't get triggered
[03:18:41] <AdvoWork> Im doing an jquery post to a php file, which does:  $data_array=array("currval"=>$stored_currval, "new_record"=>ucwords($new_record)); echo json_encode($data_array); so i know its got the data, but, when i do: var json = $.parseJSON(text); and alert(json.currval); it does nothing. I get no alert what so ever. Any ideas please?
[03:21:54] <RLa> AdvoWork, do you send correct ContentType header?
[03:22:25] <DukeDrake> hmm ... can't even change the size-attribute o.o
[03:24:59] <AdvoWork> RLa, in my php file i have header('Content-type: application/json');  and in JS when i send, ive got dataType : 'json',
[03:25:42] <RLa> that looks ok
[03:25:58] <RLa> attach error handler to json request
[03:26:22] <RLa> i recommend setting error handlers globally, for all requests
[03:26:30] <RLa> makes debugging way easier
[03:27:22] <AdvoWork> RLa, also, if i do:  success : function(text) { alert("text:"+text);  it shows: text:[object Object]
[03:28:23] <blackspotwiggins> AdvoWork, if you set datatype to json
[03:28:36] <blackspotwiggins> the success callback already gets parsed json passed into it
[03:28:42] <blackspotwiggins> check the docs next time
[03:28:57] <blackspotwiggins> and look into using firebug as a means for debugging instead of alerts
[03:29:47] <AdvoWork> blackspotwiggins, even if i remove the datatype it still doesnt work though
[03:29:51] <AdvoWork> or is that not what you meant
[03:30:22] * blackspotwiggins facepalms
[03:30:31] <RLa> if you want raw json, send it using text/plain
[03:30:38] <blackspotwiggins> RLa, why?
[03:30:43] <blackspotwiggins> are you stupid?
[03:30:52] <RLa> maybe he just wants raw json
[03:31:19] <RLa> if you are doing nothing with the sent data that would make sense a bit
[03:31:26] <AdvoWork> i dont mind how i get the data, i just need to return an array of 2 fields in php and be able to use them in my JS
[03:31:47] <RLa> then you probably want proper parsed data
[03:32:20] <darkangel> Is it possible to use a widget plugin defined as "my.multiselect" with $('#x').my.multiselect() or something, instead of just $('#x').multiselect() to avoid conflicts with other plugins?
[03:33:18] <AdvoWork> RLa, how would i go about that then? also firebug shows the response as: {"currval":"26","new_record":"Safsafsasassasas"}  so its bringing it across :S
[03:33:45] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at an IE7 jcarousel issue for me?
[03:34:05] <RLa> AdvoWork, try success : function(data) { alert("text: " + data.currval);
[03:35:16] <AdvoWork> RLa, that worked
[03:40:58] <onip> hi all. it seems to me that .data() can only read html5 data-* custom attributes. Am I wrong? If I try to store a new value then the element isn't updated.
[03:41:01] <enapupe> !stopPropagation
[03:41:07] <enapupe> !jquery stopPropagation
[03:41:31] <enapupe> !source stopPropagation
[03:41:35] <enapupe> grr
[03:43:51] <jbooker> anyone around who can explain to me why loading content in jquery tabs via ajax only works twice, then redirects the whole page?
[03:44:12] <jbooker> enapupe: do you mean event.preventDefault?
[03:44:19] <ThiefMaster> jbooker: not without seeing some code
[03:44:53] <jbooker> ThiefMaster: using the example code on jqueryui.com at http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...open_links_in_the_current_tab_instead_of_leaving_the_page
[03:45:02] <enapupe> jbooker: nope
[03:45:15] <jbooker> ThiefMaster: my code is on a disconnected network so I can't just paste it easily without faffing with memory sticks.
[03:45:44] <ThiefMaster> sounds like the click events are not registered for the newly loaded content
[03:46:09] <jbooker> ThiefMaster: basically, i'm using the tabs, and that demo code works loading the content via ajax the first time a link is clicked, but when the load(this.href) method is called and the page reloads, the callback defined for the load event doesn't trigger (i've confirmed this with  the console)
[03:46:22] <jbooker> ThiefMaster: is that clear?
[03:46:49] <ThiefMaster> hm, odd
[03:51:35] <jbooker> ThiefMaster: should calling the load(href) method disconnect the load() event handler? if so, how can i get it back, that's sort of like an endless loop of code to write.....#
[03:51:51] <ThiefMaster> no idea
[03:59:25] <denysonique> http://www.heroku.com/pricing#0-0
[03:59:25] <denysonique> What is this awesome effect called of this sticky pricing div in the middle, it scrolls until it hits the top edge of the screen
[03:59:37] <denysonique> this happens when you scroll down
[03:59:41] <denysonique> gmail does it too
[04:00:13] <RLa> slider?
[04:00:28] <denysonique> heh

[04:05:46] <JackJones> hi, someone have a lithe experience with query mobile ?
[04:09:15] <dirkpennings> does someone know a plugin like the Mac app store uses for it's highlighted image carousel?
[04:09:52] <dirkpennings> "highlighted apps slideshow" that is..
[04:13:45] <JackJones> what is the best way do display 10 000 rows in a list item ?
[04:16:10] <RLa> JackJones, display only some at once and use some kind of paging control
[04:16:31] <Findel> Hi Chaps - has anyone else here experienced a problem with .data() where looping through it in IE is completely reverse of other browsers? using $.each($("#elementId").data(), function(key, value) { // Loop code here });
[04:16:33] <JackJones> RLa: yes, i bought that to
[04:16:55] <JackJones> or i just list a the letters from a o b
[04:17:19] <ThiefMaster> Findel: you cannot expect any particular order
[04:17:33] <ThiefMaster> it's an object, object keys are not ordered according to the spec
[04:18:58] <Findel> Ah, that would make sense. I guess I expected an ordered array like jquery selector results. I'll looking into how to order the data then.
[04:19:14] <Findel> Thanks, @TheifMaster.
[04:24:00] <vdclouis> hi is it normal that this query snippet only works for the first page load? http://jsfiddle.net/RrFDA/
[04:26:31] <James13433> should input[text=" + text + "] work in ie7
[04:26:32] <James13433> ?
[04:27:05] <shellox> hi
[04:27:40] <Cork> James13433: text isn't a valid attribute for input
[04:28:00] <Cork> is value what your looking for?
[04:28:17] <Pupeno> Can I make jQuery simulate key-presses? It's for an integration test I'm writing.
[04:28:22] <James13433> Cork, im afraid I allready have a value of value so have had to use text :/
[04:28:45] <Cork> James13433: ah its a custome attribute, then prefix it with data-
[04:29:17] <James13433> and then it should work?
[04:29:19] <shellox> I hope you can help me solving a problem. I have a date field and i use jquery datepicker to let the user change the date, This works well for all loaded elements. But it wont work for a datefield created with an ajax element
[04:29:49] <Cork> James13433: it should work either way, but you should always prefix your custom attributes
[04:30:01] <shellox> the ajax generated datefield doesnt show the datepicker dialog
[04:30:03] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:30:06] <vincentl> hello
[04:30:18] <qurbonov> hello
[04:30:32] <vincentl> i have a question about the method on, is it possible to include the element itself while using the selector?
[04:30:34] <DukeDrake> I try alert($($("input[name=radio]:checked")[0]).val());  but it says 'undefined', although there's a checked radio button?
[04:30:37] <James13433> Well its going to be alot of effort for me to change them so..
[04:30:43] <IvanKuzev> shellox ..you have to make the .datepicker call after you add the field
[04:30:57] <DukeDrake> oh, found error -.-
[04:31:12] <vincentl> $("#test").on("click", "p, #test", function() {â€¦});
[04:31:30] <Cork> vincentl: that won't work
[04:31:43] <qurbonov> somebody can help
[04:31:43] <vincentl> yeah, i saw that :(
[04:31:51] <Cork> you can't have #test inside an element with the same id :)
[04:31:57] <shellox> IvanKuzev: http://dpaste.com/672337/
[04:32:08] <vincentl> but how can i tell him to include itself?
[04:32:10] <qurbonov> with JQuery and Apache Wicket
[04:32:11] <shellox> i have this in my script
[04:32:45] <Cork> vincentl: you prob need two event binders, or bind it on the parent of #test
[04:32:52] <qurbonov> how integrate JQuery and Apache Wicket
[04:33:13] <vincentl> yeah, i did it on the parent of #test :/ but i didnt like it
[04:33:17] <IvanKuzev> shellox : what about the ajax call?
[04:33:18] <vincentl> thanks :)
[04:35:57] <IvanKuzev> you have to add  $('.datepicker').datepicker(); for the new element that you make via ajax
[04:36:43] <maZtah> anyone familiar with jquery tablesorter? is it possible to link two rows to eachother?
[04:37:04] <shellox> IvanKuzev: but how?
[04:37:20] <shellox> cant i set a default value for all new fields?
[04:37:35] <shellox> the new generated field is in class datepicker
[04:37:43] <IvanKuzev> you have a success calback in the ajax function...csn i see it
[04:37:58] <shellox> so i thought the code above will apply to the new field
[04:38:22] <IvanKuzev> it wont..
[04:38:39] <ThiefMaster> selectors are only evaluated at the moment where you use them
[04:38:46] <IvanKuzev> it works for all .datepickers THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PAGE
[04:39:31] <shellox> IvanKuzev: ok thanks, I haven't known that fact. How would you solve it then?
[04:39:45] <shellox> just a new <script>$('.datepicker').datepicker();</script> at the bottom of the page?
[04:39:55] <IvanKuzev> in the ajax callback
[04:39:55] <James13433> Anyway to see, whats happening currently in ie7? like you would with inspect element with firebug?
[04:40:21] <IvanKuzev> shellox after you add the element to  to the page
[04:40:24] <DukeDrake> how can I remove the marker from a radiobutton? neither removeAttr('checked'); nor  attr('checked',false);  work?
[04:40:52] <IvanKuzev> actually how do you add it to the page?
[04:41:00] <ThiefMaster> .prop('checked', false)
[04:41:03] <ThiefMaster> @dukedrake
[04:41:08] <DukeDrake> o.o
[04:41:09] <ThiefMaster> assuming you use a non-ancient version of jquery
[04:41:20] <qurbonov> someone
[04:41:34] <DukeDrake> err ... I guess, I'm simply doing something else wrong
[04:41:42] <shellox> IvanKuzev: $('.fo').click(function(){ ...
[04:41:59] <ThiefMaster> but you are not really supposed to "uncheck" a radiobutton anyway.. usually there should always be one option checked
[04:42:05] <DukeDrake> alert (myelem.val()) works. myelem.removeAttr('checked') not
[04:42:12] <shellox> an append follows
[04:42:22] <ThiefMaster> (and yes, i do i realize that it might be something you want in a new form to the user must choose something without preselecting something)
[04:42:22] <DukeDrake> ThiefMaster: well .... or that
[04:42:46] <DukeDrake> ThiefMaster: actually I only wnat to change the currently selected radio button
[04:43:00] <IvanKuzev> shellox: well use the object that is in the append...and call it object.datepicker()
[04:43:04] <ThiefMaster> .prop('checked', true) on the radio button you want to check should work
[04:43:20] <DukeDrake> (another thing that puzzles me: I thought, checkboxes get checked, radio buttons selected ... but I can only find doku on checked radio buttons)
[04:43:37] <ThiefMaster> "selected" is only used for <option> inside <select>
[04:43:42] <DukeDrake> ah ^^
[04:44:05] <ThiefMaster> and actually, when working with <select>, you can simply use .val(value-of-the-option) on the select element
[04:44:41] <ThiefMaster> actually, it would be great if one could use .val(true|false) on a checkbox to check/uncheck it
[04:44:52] <DukeDrake> hm ... what makes you think .prop() will work, if .attr() doesn't?
[04:45:14] <DukeDrake> (prop doesn't work either)
[04:45:17] <shellox> IvanKuzev: well, there are multiple input fields in the append
[04:45:20] <ThiefMaster> which jquery version do you use?
[04:45:34] <DukeDrake> not the current on
[04:45:41] <ThiefMaster> more exact please
[04:45:43] <ThiefMaster> .prop() accesses the .checked property of the dom element; .attr() accesses the attribute
[04:45:44] <DukeDrake> 1.4.2
[04:45:56] <ThiefMaster> and i think in 1.6.0 .attr() *only* accessed the attribute and never used the property even for things like checked
[04:45:58] <ThiefMaster> ugh, that's ancient
[04:46:11] <Cork> prop doesn't exist pre 1.5
[04:46:15] <ThiefMaster> yeah
[04:46:17] <DukeDrake> yes, but I know it worked befoer ...
[04:46:20] <DukeDrake> with attr
[04:46:21] <ThiefMaster> i think .attr('checked', 'checked') and .removeAttr('checked') should do the job in those old versions
[04:46:26] <IvanKuzev> shellox:cant help you if you dont give me a a little code...maybeon private
[04:46:26] <DukeDrake> YES
[04:46:31] <ThiefMaster> can you show some code?
[04:46:33] <Cork> Duke_Puke: you could try something like $()[0].checked = true
[04:46:39] <DukeDrake> sure, hang on
[04:46:46] <Cork> *DukeDrake
[04:47:01] <Duke_Puke> Lol
[04:47:11] <IvanKuzev> shellox:the datepicker ones you need
[04:47:15] <Cork> Duke_Puke: sorry
[04:47:28] <Duke_Puke> haha np :)
[04:47:33] <DukeDrake> wtf
[04:47:53] <DukeDrake> var cchecked = $("input:checked"); alert(cchecked.val()); cchecked.removeAattr('checked',false); $("#target").attr('checked',true);
[04:48:25] <DukeDrake> sorry, drop the ",false" part
[04:48:47] <DukeDrake> the alert works
[04:48:47] <Cork> *removeAttr ;)
[04:49:06] <DukeDrake> and that ... just rewrote it
[04:49:14] <Cork> lol
[04:49:22] <Cork> ya, that should work in pre 1.5
[04:49:32] <DukeDrake> meh -.-
[04:49:57] <ThiefMaster> but seriously, consider switching to 1.7.1 - should be an easy upgrade anyway
[04:50:11] <Cork> ThiefMaster: not garanteed
[04:50:22] <Cork> 1.7 changes how events propegate
[04:50:29] <ThiefMaster> that's why i said "should" and not "will" ;)
[04:50:33] <Cork> 1.6 should be farly simple though
[04:50:45] <DukeDrake> hmm ... just tried alert(cchecked.attr('checked')) --- 'undefined' o.o
[04:51:37] <IvanKuzev> cant you use on(':checked')
[04:51:48] <ThiefMaster> you mean .is(':checked'), right?
[04:52:00] <AdvoWork> I'm really struggling with some jquery for autocomplete, my code is: http://pastebin.com/LMm0pEwW  basically it was working fine when my php code just returned the companyname, but now i need the customerid. I've changed my php code to return the array of both companynames and customerids, and im trying to get it so when i select an option given in the autocomplete, it alerts that customerid. Any ideas please?
[04:52:01] <IvanKuzev> yea...that..sorry
[04:52:35] <DukeDrake> well I select the element with var cchecked = $("input:checked") ... hence I expect it to have the attribute "checked", no??
[04:53:41] <ThiefMaster> ah
[04:53:48] <ThiefMaster> the attribute is not synced with the check state
[04:54:48] <DukeDrake> it works if no radio button is checked yet
[04:54:58] <DukeDrake> ThiefMaster: how can that be? o.o
[04:55:10] <ThiefMaster> the attribute contains whatever was set when the element was created
[04:55:13] <ThiefMaster> i.e. the initial check state
[04:55:20] <DukeDrake> ok
[04:55:30] <ThiefMaster> the checked property contains the current state
[04:55:36] <DukeDrake> but I understand: simply checking the next radio button should suffice.
[04:56:27] <ThiefMaster> but actually, i think one of the recent versions changed it so the attribute is synchronized, too
[04:57:09] <DukeDrake> ok, I'll just update ... hang on
[04:57:54] <pts\3> hey i know this is dumb but, i have a lot of forms on a page. when submitted, jquery gets the values with $("input[name=color]") , but how can i make it select the input from the submitted form? i think something to do with e.target but dont know how to concatenate it right
[04:58:22] <Cork> pts\3: bind submit to the form
[04:58:34] <Cork> pts\3: then do $(this).serializeArray()
[04:58:46] <ThiefMaster> at least with the current version it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/A24ja/
[04:58:51] <Pupeno> Anybody has an idea how I could trigger the selection of an item when using the jquery plugin tokenizer?
[04:58:52] <pts\3> oh that easy huh
[04:58:55] <pts\3> thanks Cork
[04:58:58] <Cork> np
[04:59:18] <Pupeno> I mean this one: http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[04:59:38] <DukeDrake> re
[05:00:27] <DukeDrake> ok, is 1.7.1 now ... problem still there.
[05:01:10] <DukeDrake> value is still 'undefined'
[05:02:56] <ThiefMaster> DukeDrake: can you show some codE?
[05:03:05] <ThiefMaster> or maybe even a minimal testcase showing the problem?
[05:05:22] <DukeDrake> $("#myradio").attr('checked',true);
[05:05:32] <DukeDrake> that's about it now =)
[05:05:33] <jac0bz1> http://pastebin.com/AJxZ2yrA  <-- Any idea on why this breaks IE7?
[05:06:24] <Cork> jac0bz1: display: 'inline-block',
[05:06:28] <Cork> trailing commas
[05:06:33] <DukeDrake> maybe radio buttons can't be set when accessing them via id .... >.>
[05:06:45] <ThiefMaster> of course they can, doesn't matter how you access them
[05:06:48] <ThiefMaster> try .attr('checked', 'checked')
[05:06:53] <ThiefMaster> or .prop('checked', true)
[05:06:54] <peol> DukeDrake: That's a property, since 1.6, you should use .prpop
[05:06:58] <peol> .prop*
[05:07:05] <DukeDrake> ô.o
[05:07:07] <ThiefMaster> and are you sure you actually select the correct radio button?
[05:07:16] <DukeDrake> you mean all my .attr are now .prop? =)
[05:07:24] <ThiefMaster> if you use a property, yes
[05:07:34] <ThiefMaster> checked is the most common one
[05:07:37] <peol> DukeDrake: No, only if it's an actual property on the DOM Element node
[05:07:49] <DukeDrake> ThiefMaster: I can alert its value just fine, yes. It also works if no other radio button of the group is selected yet.
[05:07:51] <ThiefMaster> (but actually, .attr() should be smart enough since 1.6.1 to work with properties, too - .prop() is just faster)
[05:08:20] <ThiefMaster> well, sounds like you really need to give us an example where we can see more than just half a line of code
[05:08:26] <peol> Yes, they did revert to that as fallback since so many users scripts broke, but you should still update your code to reflect the current API
[05:09:40] <DukeDrake> hm, it works with prop()!!
[05:09:45] <DukeDrake> *dances*
[05:10:16] <DukeDrake> .prop('checked',true) works , .attr('checked',true) doesn't!
[05:10:38] <peol> With .attr, you need .attr('checked', 'checked') or .removeAttr('checked')

[05:14:08] <Stooge> hello i have element with id="pt1:gantt:ctt::scroller". My selector is: $("#pt1\\:gantt\\:ctt\\:\\:scroller") but the element isn't selected.
[05:14:23] <Stooge> why?
[05:15:12] <IvanKuzev> why two and not one \
[05:15:49] <Zogot> is : in a css class/id a valid name?
[05:15:49] <peol> Stooge: Escaping selectors is tricky, Sizzle magically removes them depending on your operation, try adding more :p

[05:15:50] <dr0id> is it valid to have ':' in id ?
[05:16:00] <Pupeno> I'm doing $("#blah").trigger({type: "keypress", which: 188}) but in the blah input I don't see a "," appear. What is going on?
[05:16:08] <DukeDrake> peol: nice one
[05:16:34] <pts\3> Cork: i thought if they were in an array i could access them as simply as fields = $(this).serializeArray; alert(fields['color']);  if i have <input name="color" value="red" /> but it isnt that simple :(
[05:16:47] <peol> dr0id: Yes, pretty sure as long as it starts with a-z/A-Z
[05:16:49] <peol> according to spec
[05:17:01] <Cork> pts\3: no its an array, not an object
[05:17:01] <dr0id> ok
[05:17:18] <Cork> its fields[0].value/.name
[05:17:44] <pts\3> it is numerically indexed?
[05:17:58] <peol> Pupeno: You're not triggering an action, you're triggering an event with that information. You need to do input.value += ',' if you want to do that
[05:18:07] <Cork> pts\3: thats what arrays are, ya
[05:18:24] <Pupeno> peol: I see. I'll try that. Thanks.
[05:18:24] <pts\3> i see
[05:18:31] <Cork> pts\3: if its text in the key, then its an object => { color: 'value' }
[05:18:37] <peol> Pupeno: or use String.fromCharCode(188)
[05:18:52] <DukeDrake> hmm .... can't reproduce the error with jsfiddle %)
[05:18:59] <Cork> if its an array its just a list of values => [1,2,3,4,5,{ color: 'value' }]
[05:19:05] <Cork> pts\3: ^
[05:19:19] <pts\3> okay
[05:20:40] <jbooker> ack. still struggling to get this working. anyone can tell me why event handlers don't work within jquery-ui tabs when following links?
[05:21:13] <Cork> jbooker: your binding the events after the html has loaded?
[05:21:14] <Stooge> if i copy my div in jsfiddle its works there but not inside my project.
[05:21:20] <Cork> jbooker: else you need to use live events
[05:21:36] <Pupeno> archâ€¦ doing input.value += "," doesn't trigger the selection of an item in jquery tokeninput. Oh well.
[05:22:01] <Eviltwin> Pupeno: I believe you're looking for .focus
[05:22:40] <Pupeno> Eviltwin: I'm not sure how I'd apply that.
[05:23:02] <jbooker> Cork: I'm not binding it, the tabs are supposed to be
[05:23:45] <Stooge> is there any other way to select this id?  id="pt1:gantt:ctt::scroller" ? maybe ill use get element by id..
[05:24:03] <Eviltwin> Stooge: http://jsfiddle.net/eHafp/
[05:24:06] <jbooker> Cork: following the example in jquery-ui tabs documentation, clicking a link within a loaded tab works fine (using the ajax .load()) method, but then the tab's load() event listener doesn't get re-fired, so i can't force it to add the listener to all the links again
[05:24:31] <jbooker> Cork: how do i force the tab's event handler for the tab's load: option to run again?
[05:24:44] <Stooge> Eviltwin thanks i saw it. I copy my div there and it works inside http://jsfiddle.net/eHafp/ but not inside my project which is weird.
[05:25:20] <Eviltwin> Then you're doing something else wrong
[05:25:27] <Eviltwin> Try to figure that out
[05:25:36] <mushroomed> Hi, I have 3 forms with id's like
[05:26:01] <mushroomed> With prefix: xform
[05:26:14] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, why would load() event fire
[05:26:16] <mushroomed> I made a selector like this but it does't work
[05:26:16] <smurfke> Hello, does jQuery change the context/scope of `this` in .on()? F.E: $('selector').on('click'), null, { myData: this }, someFunction)
[05:26:23] <blackspotwiggins> it's only fired on _initial_ page load
[05:26:33] <mushroomed> $('form[id|="xform"]').click(function() {$('form[id|="xform"]').click(function() {
[05:26:39] <mushroomed> Sorryâ€¦ :  $('form[id|="xform"]').click(function() {
[05:26:43] <blackspotwiggins> use event delegation or listen for correct events
[05:27:10] <mushroomed> What is wrong in that selector?
[05:29:34] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: ok the example on the jquery demos site, for the '...open links in the current tab instead of leaving the page' shows a 'load' option being applied to the tabs, so that when the tab finishes loading, an event handler is added to all the links, causing the tab 'panel' to ajax-load the contents instead of completely loading a new page
[05:30:00] <ravenzz> mushroomed that means xform-whatever
[05:30:17] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, it also says that the event is called tabsload not load
[05:30:33] <mushroomed> ravenzz: yes, and now I realized it was not click, but submit
[05:30:39] <blackspotwiggins> and event delegation still stands
[05:30:40] <ravenzz> oh sure
[05:30:41] <ravenzz> :D
[05:30:41] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: the problem i have, is that after you click a link, the content successfully ajax-loads, but the new resulting content in the tab has anchors which don't have this listener. So i want the tab's 'load' option to be executed again, as if the tab knew
[05:30:44] <mushroomed> ravenzz: but it doesn't work
[05:30:45] <mushroomed> :(
[05:30:55] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: so can I just fire 'tabsload'?
[05:31:00] <ravenzz> what it is not working?
[05:31:32] <mushroomed> ravenzz: When I click a submit button of a form with id="form-whatever" it doesn't trigger
[05:31:46] <ravenzz> you mena xform
[05:31:51] <ravenzz> mean*
[05:32:46] <mushroomed> yes
[05:32:57] <AdvoWork> I'm really struggling with some jquery for autocomplete, my code is: http://pastebin.com/LMm0pEwW  basically it was working fine when my php code just returned the companyname, but now i need the customerid. I've changed my php code to return the array of both companynames and customerids, and im trying to get it so when i select an option given in the autocomplete, it alerts that customerid. Any ideas please?
[05:33:32] <ravenzz> mushroomed http://jsfiddle.net/enUbR/
[05:34:22] <ravenzz> AdvoWork you should json_encode your output array
[05:34:40] <mushroomed> ravenzz: thanks
[05:34:57] <mushroomed> ravenzz: what is the difference between preventDefault and return false ?
[05:35:45] <Eviltwin> return false also stops Propagation
[05:35:59] <ravenzz> yep
[05:36:01] <ravenzz> mushroomed http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[05:36:01] <Cork> mushroomed: return false breaks the event loop, while event.preventDefault means it will not do the default action
[05:36:16] <Cork> return false is actually more then stopPropagation and preventDefault
[05:36:27] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: help?
[05:36:30] <Cork> it will block other events on the same element
[05:36:45] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, wat?
[05:37:05] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, did you read the docs? try listening for the correct event? use event delegation?
[05:38:06] <mushroomed> thanks Cork , ravenzz
[05:38:33] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: the docs are crap. I'm using the demo on the jqueryui.com page, and it works except if you want to navigate more than one page away. I don't understand how to use event delegation in this case. I tried using .on() but that didn't work for me either, especially since the ajax .load() method is very retrictive on what you can pass to it
[05:39:19] <jbooker> hmm. i wonder if i can attach it to the container div that loads tab contents
[05:39:23] <jbooker> with on()
[05:39:35] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, that's the idea
[05:40:45] <AdvoWork> ravenzz, i do, i do: echo json_encode($row_array);
[05:41:03] <ravenzz> also you should send the correct header
[05:42:41] <mushroomed> And how could I unblockUI(); from server-side?
[05:42:42] <jac0bz1> cork: I still get an error on this line -> 				display: 'inline-block'
[05:43:30] <Cork> jac0bz1: whats the error message?
[05:43:56] <ravenzz> AdvoWork try to debug both event and ui
[05:45:36] <mushroomed> Just ignore my question :P
[05:45:46] <mushroomed> Lazy brain
[05:52:35] <MoTiOnXml> is it possible to get the list of functions that have been subscribed to e.g. the on("click"..) event for a jQuery object?
[05:52:46] <MoTiOnXml> meaning, supported in the API, not by poking around in data()
[05:52:52] <blackspotwiggins> MoTiOnXml, .data("events")
[05:53:08] <MoTiOnXml> blackspotwiggins: i'd like to filter
[05:53:10] <Cork> MoTiOnXml: thats a no
[05:53:18] <MoTiOnXml> thanks
[05:54:30] <MoTiOnXml> the sitation is this: when <something> wants to publish, it could do a check to see if the invocation list is empty and then raise an error
[05:54:50] <MoTiOnXml> like having a save command in a ribbon that requires atleast one subscriber
[05:55:01] <sasori> hi,let's say I have a <div id="example"></div> ...now I have a data coming from a database..how will I put that data right after the <div id="example"></div> ..if let's say the data I got from db has an html tags, assuming am using jquery's ajax ?
[05:55:13] <MoTiOnXml> so when the ribbon is about to raise the command, it checks for subscribers first
[05:56:00] <oal> I'm looking for a good introduction to writing my own Jquery ui widgets. I've found many guides, but they're all the same, just barely touching the surface... Any good ones out there?
[05:56:19] <Stooge> found my problem this element i am trying to get by ID wasn't loaded when i was trying to get it.
[05:56:32] <MoTiOnXml> oal: i'd question your searching then
[05:56:44] <Eviltwin> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[05:56:48] <MoTiOnXml> oal: there are plenty of great tutorials that are deep
[05:56:55] <MoTiOnXml> esp. one by ajpiano
[05:57:07] <MoTiOnXml> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[05:57:19] <MoTiOnXml> highly recommended that one
[05:57:19] <oal> Thanks guys. :-)
[05:57:21] <Zogot> Stooge: use .on()

[05:58:27] <Guest16513> Hey folks,  having a problem with :visible   http://dkp.grahamt.net  all the code comes up in the source.  im trying to fade the preview/full class divs in order depending in which is showing at the time but the IF :visible isnt working.  anyone got any ideas before i tear any more hair out?
[05:59:05] <AdvoWork> if im doing select: function( event, ui ) {  and then alert(event) and it says Object object, how can I debug this to see whats within that?
[06:00:16] <Stooge> http://jsfiddle.net/eHafp/3/ i am using this instead..
[06:00:21] <Stooge> instead of .on
[06:02:15] <MoTiOnXml> DFunk: big ups :)
[06:02:23] <Stooge> because i don't have event to put inside on
[06:09:09] <AdvoWork> what exactly is in select: function( event, ui ) { type things? im json_encoding my php data array, sending it back, and ideally on click I want to access certain bits of information, but it appears to not work.
[06:13:29] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: select: function( event, ui ) {	alert("1:"+ui.item.id);	alert("2:"+ui.item.value);}   1 is undefined but 2 works(now value) is my companyname somehow. Im returning customerid and companyname from my php array. Any ideas please?
[06:14:26] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: got time to help? sorry i had to go to a meeting so i disappeared
[06:14:38] <jbooker> I can't get event delegation to work, using .on("click"
[06:14:49] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, gonna create an example for you

[06:19:54] <Guest27529> hi i have a problem with characters displayed as question mark onmy site
[06:20:03] <blackspotwiggins> fix your encoding
[06:20:11] <Jackie99> http://www.numerologija.org/test/1.html
[06:20:28] <Jackie99> i used dreamveawer template and after that I get strange characters
[06:20:38] <Jackie99> i converted the page to dramweaver template
[06:20:42] <poppiez> how do you pass additional params when using trigger? myEl.trigger('customEvent', 1, 2, 3, 4); doesn't work
[06:20:57] <Jackie99> the same site without strange characters is this  http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[06:21:09] <Jackie99> both files are utf8
[06:22:12] <Eviltwin> poppiez: .bind('customEvent',function(event,params) { ... }) .trigger('customEvent',[1,2,3,4])
[06:22:40] <poppiez> Eviltwin: doesn't work in jquery 1.7 it seems
[06:23:07] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: what's the difference between return false in a function attached to an <a> and using event.preventDefault?
[06:23:35] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, return false also prevents bubbling
[06:24:09] <poppiez> Eviltwin: are the elements reversed?
[06:24:18] <poppiez> Eviltwin: looks like 4 is actually passed as the first argument
[06:24:29] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, and you need to have bubbling for delegation to work
[06:24:34] <Eviltwin> poppiez: You sure about that?
[06:25:35] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: ah. so i need to use preventDefault instead of return false;
[06:25:50] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, yea
[06:25:58] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: say, in your example, if instead of li's they were <a>'s with hrefs, to stop it forwarding?
[06:26:00] <jbooker> great brb
[06:26:17] <blackspotwiggins> yea you can try with that
[06:28:20] <prodn> $("select#1_hello") - I can't bind any function to this selector. If I however change from "1" in the id to anything else but a number, it works fine. What am I missing?
[06:28:42] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: still not working for me. jquery isn't attaching the event listeners to the <a>'s in the page that's returned via ajax, even though i've specified it for all divs with a class of '.ui-tabs-panel' (which is where the tabs content goes)
[06:29:07] <Eviltwin> poppiez: Oh, here: http://jsfiddle.net/JRNER/
[06:29:17] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, it's not supposed to be attaching them to <a>
[06:29:20] <blackspotwiggins> look at my example
[06:36:03] <jeffsmykil> I have elements with three classes
[06:36:08] <jeffsmykil> level1 selected static
[06:36:10] <Slartibart> http://pastebin.com/6vMSiBG0 <-- Anyone kind enough to hint about how I could improve this code regarding speed?
[06:36:12] <jeffsmykil> some have two
[06:36:17] <jeffsmykil> level1 static
[06:36:32] <Eviltwin> "selected static"?
[06:36:32] <jeffsmykil> how can i make sure the level1 selected static dont also get level1 static
[06:37:07] <jeffsmykil> .selected .static?
[06:37:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry
[06:37:36] <prodn> "select#1_anything" does not work. I am trying to get element by the id "1_anything". When I change to "a_anything" it works however. What am I doing wrong? Some characters not supported?
[06:37:56] <Eviltwin> $(".level1.selected.static") won't match elements that don't have all three classes
[06:38:08] <jeffsmykil> perfect
[06:38:09] <jeffsmykil> but
[06:38:15] <jeffsmykil> what about in the instance of two
[06:38:23] <jeffsmykil> the style for two will go to the one with all three
[06:38:46] <Eviltwin> Oh, so this is a CSS question?
[06:38:58] <jeffsmykil> oh i suppose it is
[06:39:01] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: this is closer to what i have : http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/1/
[06:39:01] <jeffsmykil> and i didnt realize it
[06:39:11] <jbooker> i can't prevent default using your code, as you can see
[06:39:27] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Do you know about the precidence of CSS selectors
[06:39:33] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: and i dont know enough about the anonymous functions to change it
[06:40:04] <jeffsmykil> eviltwin vaguely?
[06:40:06] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity
[06:40:08] <jeffsmykil> just dont make me go into #css
[06:40:20] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, you have a syntax error
[06:40:24] <blackspotwiggins> no shit it does not work
[06:40:29] <blackspotwiggins> do you even use a debugger?
[06:41:17] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin:  I tried some jquery with !has Class
[06:41:20] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: i am editing it live on jsfiddle - the computer i'm developing on isn't allowed to connect to the internet
[06:41:21] <jeffsmykil> but it didnt work
[06:41:45] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: i assume you mean the 'e' reference that wasn't valid - how about this version http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/2/
[06:42:02] <bjensen> how performance heavy are delegates compared to live?
[06:42:15] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, dude
[06:42:20] <blackspotwiggins> please try to run it first
[06:42:27] <blackspotwiggins> $this is not defined
[06:42:30] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: i did, your example works
[06:42:39] <jbooker> but jsfiddle doesn't show me a debugger.
[06:42:47] <Slartibart> bjensen: Less.
[06:42:55] <poppiez> Eviltwin: thx! :)
[06:43:40] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: why doesn't $this reference the <a> that's been clicked, surely it should if that's what i've attached the function to?
[06:43:52] <AdvoWork> anyone here got an example of an auto complete, with 2 fields being returned from a DB?
[06:44:13] <blackspotwiggins> ok first of all
[06:44:17] <blackspotwiggins> prevetndefault is a function
[06:44:19] <blackspotwiggins> tou have to call it
[06:44:21] <blackspotwiggins> with ()
[06:44:23] <jbooker> oh i see because i'm waiting for it to bubble up
[06:44:28] <blackspotwiggins> second, you dont define $this anywhere
[06:44:33] <jbooker> yes that was a typo, but 'event' doesn't exist
[06:44:36] <blackspotwiggins> this refers to the current element
[06:44:41] <jbooker> and i assumed $this is auto-created.
[06:44:46] <jbooker> OH
[06:44:46] <blackspotwiggins> why ?
[06:44:50] <jbooker> $this/this
[06:44:58] <jbooker> can you tell i am a php/java developer :D
[06:45:00] <blackspotwiggins> why not !this or _this?
[06:46:01] <jbooker> so how then, from the 'tabcontainer' div, do i tell which link has been clicked on? i have no 'event' object passed into the anonymous function!
[06:46:03] <donCams> hi. anybody here used farbtastic?
[06:46:18] <blackspotwiggins> jbooker, <blackspotwiggins> this refers to the current element
[06:46:20] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: please bear with me i've been at this for hours :D
[06:46:46] <blackspotwiggins> and event is the first argument for the event handler
[06:46:46] <jbooker> blackspotwiggins: but this will point to the div, because that's where the listener is?
[06:46:56] <blackspotwiggins> does it now?
[06:47:09] <blackspotwiggins> and how. pray tell did my example work then?
[06:47:20] <blackspotwiggins> why did not all the <li>s turn red?
[06:47:26] <blackspotwiggins> think for 5 minutes
[06:48:39] <jbooker> yes you're right. sorry.
[06:48:49] <jbooker> bear with me a second :D
[06:49:45] <jbooker> hmm jsfiddle seems to have crashed...
[06:52:04] <Eviltwin> w00t! If jsFiddle is down, we're all off the hook!

[06:57:19] <Eviltwin> Okay
[06:57:29] <jeffsmykil> that's kosher?
[06:57:40] <jeffsmykil> or does it only look at the same "level"

[07:02:08] <Whirl3d> when writing a plugin, when do you use $.fn.pluginname and when do you use $.pluginname  ?
[07:02:22] <jbooker> ok got preventdefault running, but this.parent.load() is failing
[07:04:37] * jeffsmykil bugs Eviltwin some more
[07:04:38] <jeffsmykil>  $("a.selected").parent().next("li > a" ).addClass('adjacent');
[07:05:27] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: What'd your goal with that?
[07:05:31] <sanjayb> Whirl3d, $.fn.pluginname is when you want your plugin to be a method of jQuery object .. so use would be like: $('#foo').pluginname();
[07:05:51] <jbooker> ack gtg
[07:05:58] <sanjayb> Whirl3d, just $.pluginname would just be a normal function, just under the $ namespace
[07:05:58] <jeffsmykil> to get the next a to have a new class
[07:06:25] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: and in $.fn.pluginname, you get the jquery object being operated upon as 'this' inside your function
[07:07:03] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: also world domination
[07:07:04] <AdvoWork> hmm, im doing select: function( event, ui ) {alert("Selected: " + ui.item.value + " aka " + ui.item.label + " aka " + ui.item.name);   but how/where does it get value/label/name from? as im returning 2 fields customerid and companyname
[07:07:27] <Whirl3d> sanjayb, thanks for the reply. When you "expose public methods" on a plugin, you would extend the plugin namespace like: $.fn.plugin.newmethod, right? (thanks for your help)
[07:07:47] <sanjayb> Whirl3d
[07:08:02] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: uh, sorry, hit enter by mistake
[07:08:20] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: it is an ul with li with a:links inside of them
[07:08:28] <jeffsmykil> trying to get to the next tabs a:link
[07:08:30] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: i *think* that should work .. however, have never had to do that myself, so do not know for certain ..
[07:08:35] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: The selector in the .next refers to the sibling
[07:08:51] <Eviltwin> If you want to get the A inside the next LI after the parent of this element
[07:08:59] <Eviltwin> .parent().next("li").find("a")
[07:09:11] <Whirl3d> sanjayb, do you have a link to a better resource for writing a plugin than the jquery site?
[07:09:13] <jeffsmykil> find stops after one?
[07:09:35] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: No, throw a .first() on the end if you need to ensure that
[07:09:46] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: i would ask google .. sorry, dont know of anything good off the top of my head right now :(
[07:10:20] <jeffsmykil> aha
[07:10:21] <jeffsmykil> $("a.selected").parent().next("li").find("a").first().addClass("adjacent");
[07:10:23] <jeffsmykil> did the trick
[07:10:35] <Stooge> gj!
[07:10:55] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: this looks decent: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[07:10:55] <jeffsmykil> thank you evil marlin
[07:12:40] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: not sure what you're trying to do, but the use case of "expose public events", in general, i think maybe better to handle by binding custom events and then triggering them on the jquery object .. not sure of your use case, though ..
[07:12:41] <Whirl3d> sanjayb, thanks for the reply. This is a classic example of the problem with Google: when given 10^6 solutions, it's better to ask people that have experience than it is to rely on your own ability to filter that many results. I will check out the link you provided. And again, thanks for your advice
[07:13:14] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: sure, this is indeed the problem. i find duckduckgo a bit better as a search engine for tech stuff, but ymmv
[07:13:45] <Whirl3d> duckduckgo?
[07:14:48] <Whirl3d> sanjayb, love it. thanks.
[07:14:58] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: ;-)
[07:22:50] <jophin> hi
[07:23:19] <Seppoz> can i include jquery in commercial projects?
[07:23:40] <adoven> Seppoz: yes
[07:23:41] <jophin> hi
[07:23:51] <Seppoz> without releasing its source?
[07:24:09] <adoven> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt
[07:24:32] <Eviltwin> http://jquery.org/license/
[07:25:08] <Seppoz> ok, so mit licence does not require to release source code right?
[07:25:16] <adoven> right
[07:25:21] <Seppoz> cool, thank you
[07:26:35] <RLa> technically, for a web project, it would be quite hard to not "release" source
[07:28:28] <Eviltwin> Unless the site's not public
[07:28:58] <RLa> hm, that's true
[07:29:52] <Seppoz> RLa: im including it into c++ ressources
[07:30:05] <Seppoz> so gpl could take that as "linkingh" against it
[07:30:13] <Seppoz> thats why i was wondering
[07:30:32] <RLa> Seppoz, using with webkit?
[07:30:38] <Seppoz> no
[07:30:47] <Seppoz> just sending it to the client
[07:31:32] <RLa> i have thought about desktop apps built with javascript, standalone webkit makes it really easy
[07:31:52] <Eviltwin> I like HTML/JS/CSS for the portability
[07:32:01] <Eviltwin> But for desktop apps, it's a lot of overhead over native
[07:32:05] <RLa> and you can also use js for scripting qt
[07:32:19] <RLa> native apps are not easy to port
[07:33:30] <RLa> webkit itself is quite portable, and app written using it would look same on all platforms
[07:35:05] <RLa> i'm finding html easier to write than native uis in various c++ tookits
[07:35:18] <sanjayb> RLa, i just got done building something using jquery mobile and now going to experiment with using PhoneGap to convert it to native apps .. seems like a sane approach, yes. have to see how it works ..
[07:36:25] <RLa> haha
[07:36:32] <RLa> looks like it already uses webkit
[07:38:35] <RLa> this approach would allow you to use same codebase for both web and desktop apps
[07:38:58] <RLa> well, for web, desktop, and mobile apps :)
[07:40:48] <RLa> v8 + webkit combo would be quite nice
[07:41:22] <Eviltwin> V8 is used in Chrome
[07:42:15] <Pupeno> Does anyone have an idea how could I programatically select an option from jquery token input?
[07:46:28] <johnathanb> Hey, using CKEditor and was wondering if there was a way to change a label of a field in a dialog?
[07:46:38] <johnathanb> Without having to edit the plugin source
[07:50:32] <Spadeski> Whats some kewl jQuery features I could add to a website when the user is logged out ?
[07:59:47] <joshsmith> how do I namespace a function?
[08:00:12] <Eviltwin> var namespace = { myfunc: function(){...}, ... };
[08:02:01] <joshsmith> thanks Eviltwin
[08:02:28] <joshsmith> so let's say I have a particular view where there are a set of brands
[08:02:53] <joshsmith> conceptually how should I be namespacing this?
[08:03:19] <joshsmith> namespacing per view? so chooseBrands.filter() (for a filtering function)?
[08:03:45] <joshsmith> and how should I make sure my jQuery only fires on that view
[08:04:53] <Eviltwin> To be honest I don't really understand enough about the situation to answer the question
[08:05:01] <Eviltwin> And I don't have a lot of time right now
[08:05:17] <Eviltwin> If you can put together a jsFiddle or something showing these different views and what you're looking for
[08:05:22] <Eviltwin> I'm sure someone can help you
[08:07:01] <Spadeski> Sup Eviltwin how's ya day been ?
[08:09:29] <dirkpennings> does someone know a plugin like the Mac App Store uses for it's highlighted apps slideshow?
[08:14:55] <rahmen> Hi! I'm trying to make datepicker work for a paragraph. I want the same functionality as with inputs. But it seems it doesn't work out of the box? I expected it to work with $('p.date').datepicker(); Is there a reason for this or am I just coding wrong?
[08:15:25] <Eviltwin> Datepickers are designed to work on text inputs
[08:18:41] <_thumper_> Hey. This is not specifically JQuery related. Is there any way to access javascript variables from different script blocks?
[08:19:07] <Eviltwin> <script>var a = "foo";</script><script>alert(a);</script>
[08:19:10] <Eviltwin> It alerts "foo"
[08:19:28] <_thumper_> Ah it should work. Thanks
[08:19:47] <_thumper_> If it doesn't i will declare a setter and getter functions
[08:20:03] <amcsi_work> hello
[08:20:07] <Eviltwin> Not sure how that helps but go for it!
[08:20:24] <amcsi_work> for mousedown, why is firefox's offsetX and Y both undefined?
[08:20:54] <Eviltwin> amcsi_work: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[08:21:03] <Eviltwin> Event Properties are the only ones it promises to have
[08:21:38] <Eviltwin> I suggest you use pageX and pageY and $("#relativeTo").offset()
[08:21:45] <Eviltwin> To calculate the offset you want
[08:21:50] <amcsi_work> okay, thx
[08:22:05] <zephir> heya
[08:22:55] <zephir> i was trying to $.load() content from a remote server... learned that it is not possible due to security issues
[08:23:02] <Eviltwin> Correct
[08:23:04] <Eviltwin> ?sop
[08:23:04] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:23:24] <zephir> exactly
[08:23:54] <zephir> jsonp is supposed to be the way to go
[08:23:56] <Eviltwin> There's no "way around it" if that's what you're looking for
[08:24:10] <Eviltwin> JSONP uses a different techique that the server must be configured to accept
[08:24:51] <zephir> well since i host the server it could work, right?
[08:25:17] <AdvoWork> im doing $('#'+table+'').prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>');  which works, but is there a way I can do that if more than 1 table exists?
[08:25:22] <AdvoWork> with the same name?
[08:25:39] <rahmen> Eviltwin: I tried to get it working with onSelect, can you check this code? http://pastie.org/3005847 Instead of destroying the datepicker it removes the paragraph...
[08:30:36] <zephir> Eviltwin: Thanks for the info :)
[08:30:46] <zephir> have a nice day you all
[08:30:59] <Alex82> any idea how to save graphs from jsPlumb into localStorage ?
[08:33:59] <Stooge> http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html wow this looks cool :)
[08:34:28] <Stooge> i hope to never need to use it :)
[08:38:42] <Alex82> it s nice indeed but being only a view there is not any documentation about how to manipulate objects and store them
[08:39:41] <Alex82> i'd like to save a graphs state and then reload it when needed
[08:41:06] <Stooge> I have a tooltip that shows up on mouse enter and hides on mouse leave but in some cases the tooltip positions intself under the mouse and closes itself and then opens again in a loop... how to avoid the tooltip closing when the mouse is on top of it?
[08:42:31] <AdvoWork> how can i count the number of divs with a certain id?
[08:42:52] <adoven> you really shouldn't have multiple elements on a page with the same id
[08:42:56] <adoven> use classes
[08:43:28] <adoven> then you can do $(".foo").length
[08:44:12] <Spadeski> AdvoWork use classes man
[08:44:17] <Stooge> wow didn't know about this very useful for me atm adoven :)
[08:44:22] <nyash> Hello, I am trying to bind a scroll event, to a dynamically created element. I am trying to use the new on method. Like this: $("div.a").on("scroll", '.b', function(e) { alert("xx") } ); But it Fails. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Ga3uP/1/
[08:47:05] <AdvoWork> adoven, Spadeski so instead of $('#'+table+'') itl just be $('.'+table+'') ?
[08:47:55] <Spadeski> AdvoWork and you will use class="" instead of id=""
[08:48:09] <Spadeski> you can define multiple classes using class="Class1 Class2"
[08:49:15] <AdvoWork> Spadeski, so simply <input type="text" id="test" name="whatever" class="mainfield">  then $('.mainfield') ... ?
[08:49:40] <adoven> AdvoWork: yes
[08:51:04] <AdvoWork> adoven, and but what if i need to do multiple of: $('.'+table+'').prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>'); ?
[08:52:01] <RLa> javascript with too much string concatenation looks very ugly
[08:52:09] <adoven> hehe i was just thinking that RLa
[08:52:32] <Stooge> but if the html isnt generated by him he will have to use that probably..
[08:53:07] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork well you pick only single element...no nececeary only by class
[08:53:08] <AdvoWork> i can change that, but still, if i run that, it will only update the table for one of the items with that class, not multiple?
[08:53:26] <AdvoWork> but i may have 2 or 3 elements i want to do exactly the same(with the same class)
[08:54:46] <RLa> i think $('.'+table+'') could be replaced by filter and hasClass
[08:56:09] <big_swimmer> http://jsfiddle.net/phFcZ/ when you hit the little ">" character on the leaf nodes, i cant click in the input boxes and i can't figure out why.
[08:57:03] <Spadeski> Advowork yup
[08:58:23] <RLa> AdvoWork, $('table').filter(function(i) { return this.hasClass(table); });
[08:58:24] <AdvoWork> so how would $('.'+table+'').prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>'); work with something like $("div#result3").prepend($("p").hasClass("whatever").toString());   as i dont have a div#result3 in this case?
[08:59:06] <IvanKuzev> big_swimmer: that looks ok over here.
[08:59:21] <RLa> what, why are you adding <option> to tables
[08:59:37] <Spadeski> yup yup
[08:59:41] <djcoin> Hi folks
[08:59:42] <big_swimmer> IvanKuzev: i'm just not able to focus on the <input type=text />
[08:59:54] <djcoin> Does $element.val() triggers some event, eg, change ?
[09:00:01] <RLa> no
[09:00:09] <djcoin> Yep, so I have a bug somewhere
[09:00:15] <djcoin> Or some stuff I dont understand
[09:00:22] <djcoin> thanks RLa
[09:02:05] <RLa> djcoin, not sure if you use it with argument
[09:02:24] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  What's the best approach to validating jQuery UI modal dialog forms?
[09:02:24] <RLa> i would imagine that trigger change event
[09:02:41] <IvanKuzev> big_swimmer> cant seem to find a .focus() or similar trigger
[09:03:29] <RLa> MarcGuay, if it requires lot of data, do it on server side and send json response containing possible errors
[09:03:35] <djcoin> RLa: is there a way to know what triggers some events ?
[09:04:02] <MarcGuay> RLa: Simple email address validation.  Hoping to find a simple way to use the Validation plugin I'm using with the rest of the site.
[09:04:12] <big_swimmer> IvanKuzev: thanks for your time and attention m8, i'll have to try some more stuff and i'll post again if i exaust every thing i can think of
[09:04:13] <RLa> i guess you have to look at jquery code and browser docs, or use debugger
[09:04:14] <andrew9183> ckeditor will be the last of me
[09:04:51] <djcoin> k
[09:11:13] <jcrawford> hey guys on line 36 i have an if/else but it does not seem to work.  When the page loads both buttons are hidden and neither is shown, thoughts? http://pastebin.com/zdnUxyHC
[09:11:18] <joshsmith> is there a better way to disable a button than .attr('disabled', 'disabled') ?
[09:11:22] <jcrawford> maybe i am doing some newb mistake :D
[09:16:47] <IvanKuzev> jcrawford> look at the css for both buttons...that js looks ok
[09:17:18] <MarcGuay> jcrawford: Put a debugger in there a see which side of the switch you fall into, if at all.
[09:18:39] <IvanKuzev> well he shoud atleast go into the else...if the js dont crash
[09:19:26] <tuja> hello, i am trying to find a jqeury image gallery but i cannot remember the name of it. it has thumbnails to the left with a larger version of the image to the right, can anyone recall which image gallery it is ? Thanks
[09:19:38] <big_swimmer> jcrawford: if you do a jsfiddle, we'll get a better look at things
[09:23:29] <gerryvdm> hi, why would ie7 be throwing errors on $('#content .page').animate({ left: '-=100%' }) ?
[09:23:47] <jcrawford> the odd part is if i do display: block in the css both buttons will show
[09:23:50] <jcrawford> so it has to be the js or something :D
[09:24:11] <jcrawford> can't fiddle this it's a large project which requires a ton of images etc. which are not publicly accessible just yet
[09:25:21] <jcrawford> my bad i see why its happening
[09:27:24] <jcrawford> odd appears .show() and .hide() wont work there, I had to use .css("display", "block"); etc.
[09:28:16] <Stooge> maybe you had display:none
[09:28:22] <Stooge> instead of visibility hidden
[09:28:30] <jcrawford> in my css I did have display: none
[09:28:36] <jcrawford> so that's why it was happening :D
[09:28:47] <jcrawford> tnx guts & gals'
[09:29:03] <Stooge> yw :)
[09:29:15] <Stooge> finally my turn to help somebody its awesome :)
[09:30:18] <jcrawford> yep finally someone who knows less than you about JQuery :D
[09:30:24] <Stooge> ^^
[09:31:24] <Zxurian_> before I try to reinvent the wheel, does anyone know of any libraries that duplicate the functionality here?: http://www.uniworld.com/ebrochure/EuropeRussia2012/
[09:32:45] <ragas> its flash.
[09:32:58] <jcrawford> i was going to state that too but thought it was obvious :D
[09:33:13] <Zxurian_> yes, I know the linked page is flash, I'm looking to duplicate the thumbnail & click-to-zoom, but in a javascript / jquery library
[09:33:19] <jcrawford> he probably knows that and is looking for JS equivalents
[09:33:19] <RLa> i those fucking jumpy selectors like that on below
[09:33:40] <RLa> click-to-zoom is nice tho
[09:33:53] <Zxurian_> i'm googling now, but figured I'd ask to see if anyone had any recommendations
[09:34:18] <ragas> if you search for jquery slideshow, theres a pge last lists about 20 of them, and theres one in there that's pretty close
[09:34:38] <Zxurian_> ragas: do you have a link to the list?
[09:35:05] <ragas> http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CEwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dynamicwp.net%2Farticles-and-tutorials%2Ftop-20-jquery-slideshow-and-image-gallery-tutorials%2F&ei=OjvmTpWsJqb-iQKV76GwBg&usg=AFQjCNEh5PVTBm9FgQwA54nRfIfoPa58ZA&sig2=aKj_bo-EO14gmwhZGFn2Jw
[09:35:37] <jcrawford> bet JS will be less laggy than flash too lol'
[09:36:48] <ragas> i dont think it has the page turn effect, but the pretty thumblinks are there.
[09:37:03] <phlp> if you view the page with flash disabled there is a nice js viewer. i thought he was talking about that originally since i dont have flash installed
[09:37:50] <phlp> looks like is uses issuu.com
[09:39:23] <Zxurian_> yea, client wants the flash visuals, and I don't want to use flash to do it, so i'm looking for a javascript alternative
[09:41:57] <phlp> take a look at this http://www.20thingsilearned.com
[09:52:23] <Zxurian_> phlp: thanks for the link

[11:30:22] <MarcGuay> ckeditor + jquery validation plugin = is it really this complicated?
[11:36:05] <rroelofs> MarcGuay, yep.  You have to extracrt the data from ckeditor, validate it and then put it back.  validation is complicated because it is html.
[11:38:45] <zeejy> Does anyone know how to connect two sortable() divs that have overflow set to auto so that when you move an item from one div to the other, the positioning of the dragged item becomes relative to the new div it's now located in?
[11:42:58] <jeffsmykil> Has anyone run into this decidedly not Jquery issue?

[11:44:17] <zeejy> @jeffsmykil Ran into many problems like this. Joys of IE!
[11:44:36] <jeffsmykil> just in IE 8
[11:44:38] <Hopsy> bot-t: tell Stooge to came back
[11:44:38] <bot-t> Hopsy, Okay.
[11:44:41] <jeffsmykil> its perfect in IE 7 and 9
[11:44:44] <Hopsy> bot-t tell Stooge to came back
[11:45:27] <jeffsmykil> Hopsy: so no inkling?
[11:45:39] <jeffsmykil> I've searched the code and cant find anything
[11:45:55] <zeejy> Code?
[11:45:59] <zeejy> Make an example in JSFiddle
[11:46:52] <Hopsy> jeffsmykil: what is the problem?
[11:47:01] <Hopsy> I dont use internet explorer :')
[11:47:04] <jeffsmykil> did you look?
[11:47:05] <jeffsmykil> https://skitch.com/jsmykil/gxanq/windows-7-x64
[11:47:13] <Hopsy> no :p
[11:47:16] <jeffsmykil> its a picture of the problem
[11:47:46] <zeejy> A picture doesn't give any insight into your structure or CSS :)
[11:48:07] <jeffsmykil> nope but I was hoping it would trigger someones memory of a simlar situation
[11:48:13] <jeffsmykil> before I fiddeled it
[11:48:29] <zeejy> Too many possible causes
[11:51:29] <jeffsmykil> ok jsfiddle is now moving at snail pace
[11:52:16] <Hopsy> jeffsmykil: use ie hack
[11:52:28] <Hopsy> it is your css
[11:54:26] <jeffsmykil> here is my fiddle
[11:54:27] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/76sUj/3/
[11:54:32] <jeffsmykil> its really simple
[11:56:05] <jeffsmykil> hoopsy?
[11:57:26] <phlp> jeffsmykil: vertical-align:top on the button?
[11:58:27] <jeffsmykil> i will try it
[11:58:50] <jeffsmykil> phip
[11:58:57] <jeffsmykil> i dont nknow why that worked
[11:59:00] <jeffsmykil> but I could kiss you
[11:59:15] <Hopsy> :')
[11:59:41] <Hopsy> vertical align? isnt that used for tables?
[11:59:46] <Hopsy> are you using tables?
[11:59:55] <jeffsmykil> i am not
[11:59:57] <jeffsmykil> but it worked
[12:00:45] <donCams> hi all
[12:01:10] <jehoshua02> What's the best way to parse a url?
[12:01:13] <Hopsy> it makes internet explorer more aids
[12:03:42] <jehoshua02> I'm not finding anything in JQuery for parsing urls.
[12:04:06] <jehoshua02> Not only do I need to parse, but rebuild too.
[12:04:23] <phlp> https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[12:05:35] <smplstk> you don't need jQuery to parse URL's
[12:06:18] <jehoshua02> smplstk: But it still seems I'd have to write a lot of code to do some pretty common things.
[12:06:32] <jehoshua02> Like appending a query variable.
[12:10:49] <donCams> can anybody recommend a good colorpicker? i can't attach ajax calls on farbtastic, which is included in wordpress
[12:12:46] <Whirl3d> jehoshua02, use regex
[12:31:08] <smplstk> jehoshua02: var query_var = 'OMG'; $('a').attr( 'href', 'http://whatever.com?' + query_var );
[12:31:11] <smplstk> ?
[12:31:46] <jehoshua02> smplstk: I need to respect query variables already in the url.
[12:32:49] <jehoshua02> smplstk: I think it's strange there aren't methods already available for setting and getting variables from the query string.
[12:33:00] <Whirl3d> checkout ben allmans' deparameterize plugin
[12:35:02] <jehoshua02> Whirl3d: you mean this one: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/?a[]=0&a[1][]=1&a[1][]=2&a[2][]=3&a[2][1][]=4&a[2][1][]=5&a[2][2][]=6&a[3][b][]=7&a[3][b][1][]=8&a[3][b][1][]=9&a[3][b][2][0][c]=10&a[3][b][2][0][d]=11&a[3][b][3][0][]=12&a[3][b][4][0][0][]=13&a[3][b][5][e][f][g][]=14&a[3][b][5][e][f][g][1][]=15&a[3][b][]=16&a[]=17
[12:35:07] <jehoshua02> Oops.
[12:35:15] <ravenzz> lol
[12:35:23] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[12:36:16] <Whirl3d> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-urlinternal-plugin/
[12:36:17] <jehoshua02> set a query string variable before setting window.location.
[12:36:42] <jehoshua02> But I'm looking for an OOP way to do it, not a string or regex.
[12:37:15] <ravenzz> would you append to the current query string?
[12:38:58] <smplstk> jehoshua02: it is kind of lame that there aren't inbuilt methods for getting query params
[12:39:04] <smplstk> #truth
[12:39:09] <ravenzz> ..
[12:39:19] <ravenzz> actually document.location.search returns the query string
[12:39:33] <jehoshua02> smplstk: seriously.
[12:40:10] <wtfizzle> I have a custom object that I use that makes a hash map of the query string on page load and allows you to append or remove properties
[12:40:20] <wtfizzle> I can try to look it up if you want
[12:40:29] <smplstk> ravenzz: you still need to iterate through that.
[12:40:52] <jehoshua02> Are there any plans to add something like this to JQuery?
[12:40:52] <smplstk> whereas in PHP you can just be like $_GET['var'];
[12:40:53] <ravenzz> you can slipt
[12:40:56] <ravenzz> split
[12:40:58] <jehoshua02> And candidates for JQuery?
[12:41:05] <smplstk> ravenzz: still, annoying, don't you think?
[12:41:25] <smplstk> and you're still left with splitting on both ? AND &
[12:41:27] <ravenzz> it is
[12:41:45] <Whirl3d> no need to bulk up jquery core when there are perfectly good plugins like ben allman's $.deparam method
[12:42:14] <jehoshua02> Whirl3d: Good to know.
[12:42:53] <ravenzz> smplstk anyway those kind of stuffs should be done in the server-side
[12:43:03] <smplstk> ^^
[12:43:11] <smplstk> well - it depends really.
[12:43:17] <jehoshua02> yep. depends.
[12:43:54] <smplstk> jehoshua02, Whirl3d's suggestion about deparam was solid, check out Ben's BBQ plugin as well.
[12:44:00] <ravenzz> so i used should instead of must :p
[12:44:00] <smplstk> If you're looking for that sort of stuff.
[12:44:07] <jehoshua02> Yeah. I'm looking at it.
[12:44:13] <ravenzz> bbl
[12:45:09] <tomasm-> hi, i'm trying to customize a link depending upon an input field elsewhere, ie I have a calculator that takes in a quantity and there are two functions - 'calculate price' and 'shipping'... the shipping goes to a lightbox window, but if the user directly clicks on the 'shipping' link after they change the quantity (which otherwise onChange updates the link to pass the quantity in the query string), the link doesnt get changed in time..
[12:45:09] <tomasm-> ... i was wondering if there was an event that happened BEFORE the link gets clicked and AFTER the quantity input loses focus. onChange doesnt seem to fire in time.... and the onClick for the link doesnt seem to accept modification of the href attribute to change where it goes. (window.location dosnt work since it's meant to be a shadowbox)
[12:46:34] <tomasm-> hmmm, i might be wrong
[12:47:24] <Whirl3d> tomasm, you can use e.preventDefault() to stop the change in href and then manually set it using window.location after you modify it in your click handler.
[12:49:41] <donCams> hello
[12:50:09] <donCams> how can I have $('#someId').css('border-left-color'); return a hex value?
[12:51:52] <tomasm-> donCams, any chance you're trying to change that color to some variant?
[12:53:32] <donCams> tomasm-: yes. but i need to display the hex value first in an input box
[12:53:42] <jiggliemon> there's this really weird bug w/ jQuery.template that if you add the plugin to the page inline - it doesn't work.
[12:53:52] <jiggliemon> but if you include it via a script tag, you're golden.
[12:54:02] <jiggliemon> Odds are I'm doing something wrong.
[12:54:09] <jiggliemon> But that's weird as shit to me.
[12:54:42] <tomasm-> donCams, why not just always make sure it's in hex? or might the user type in a word? not sure if this helps: www.webresourcesdepot.com/manipulate-colors-with-jquery-xcolor/
[13:05:56] <crankharder> say I add two click events to a single button.  are they going to run linearly and in the order I added them?
[13:06:39] <jiggliemon> crankharder: most likely.
[13:06:49] <jiggliemon> *yes and most likely
[13:07:25] <Whirl3d> If you mean two click handlers, they will fire at almost the same time, I believe
[13:07:25] <jiggliemon> They will run linearly in the order that JavaScript reads them
[13:07:48] <jiggliemon> Last read is the last fired.
[13:08:02] <jiggliemon> read/added
[13:08:31] <Whirl3d> in microseconds, though. If you want to handle the events sequentially, you will need to approach it differently
[13:08:57] <jiggliemon> consider events as an array, $(el).events[click].push(fn)
[13:09:26] <jiggliemon> and when you click, it will loop through the click array
[13:09:59] <jiggliemon> This is essentially what's happening under the hood.
[13:10:14] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript, only one function is running at a time
[13:10:19] <Eviltwin> There's only one stack
[13:10:23] <kanzie> How do I best prevent the users from entering an illegal number with more than one . in itâ€¦ like 3.14.156 I want to convert to 3.14156, however 3 should stay three and 4.23 4.23
[13:10:32] <Eviltwin> If you're inside one click listener, until you exit it, you can't be in another
[13:10:55] <jiggliemon> kanzie: "entering" in a form field?
[13:11:05] <Whirl3d> then how does event bubbling work?
[13:11:26] <kanzie> jiggliemon: Im more looking for a good way to parse the input. I already have it clear the value if it is not numeric
[13:11:27] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: How do you think it works?
[13:11:39] <kanzie> I want to assist the user doing right, rather then punishing when doing wrong
[13:12:24] <jiggliemon> kanzie: you'll need to listen to keyup events, and if the key code is == to what ever the period code is - return false.
[13:12:25] <Whirl3d> if I have two click handlers setup for an element and in the first handler, I prevent default, the second handler never fires. But where does the default bubbling fit in to this?
[13:12:34] <jiggliemon> (if there's already one period that is)
[13:13:08] <kanzie> jiggliemon: in that case wouldn't it be easier to split the string at the first . and then replace all . in second array item and then merge them?
[13:13:17] <Whirl3d> in other words, which fires first? the bubbled click event or the second handler?
[13:13:35] <jiggliemon> jQuery('input').bind('keyup', function(e) { if(e.keyCode == something && alreadyHasPeriod} return; })
[13:13:40] <jiggliemon> something something.
[13:13:42] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/bfcg2/
[13:13:59] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: All handlers for the element, then all handlers for the parent and so forth
[13:14:02] <jiggliemon> kanzie: there's a million ways to handle the value.
[13:14:11] <jiggliemon> pick which ever works best for you.
[13:14:11] <Eviltwin> In the order they were bound on each level
[13:14:17] <jiggliemon> or which is more readable.
[13:14:48] <Whirl3d> ah, that makes more sense...thanks
[13:15:56] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Also preventDefault doesn't do anything to event bubbling
[13:16:09] <Eviltwin> It prevents the browser's default action for that event
[13:16:21] <Eviltwin> Such as a form actually sending you to a new page
[13:16:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/bfcg2/2/
[13:16:59] <Eviltwin> And .stopPropagation() stops it from going up to the next parent, not the next handler at the same lavel
[13:17:02] <Eviltwin> level*
[13:17:45] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/bfcg2/3/
[13:17:45] <Whirl3d> But in the fiddle I just sent, you get the first handler, then the parent handler, never the second handler.
[13:18:01] <Eviltwin> No, you're actually just going through them too quickly
[13:18:04] <Eviltwin> Try a console.log instead
[13:19:08] <Whirl3d> how  could I be going through them any quicker than they can fire if they can only do one at a time? (thanks for the instruction, btw)
[13:19:10] <Eviltwin> In at least some browsers, pressing enter for too long or clicking the OK button on the alert for too long can actually cause it to dismiss two alerts
[13:19:22] <Whirl3d> gotcha
[13:19:24] <rubberneck> Hi, I have never used jquery and have not every written a line of code in java. I do write code in python quite often. I need help with a HTML table. the table has many columns, some of the columns cells have a CSS class assigned to them. I want to be able to click on a row and highlight it, then have the row go back to what it was when a new row is clicked. The challenge is that cells in a...
[13:19:26] <rubberneck> ...row are not all the same color. Any help would be great.
[13:20:04] <jehoshua02> This is what I needed right here! http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery.param.querystring%28build_url%29
[13:20:15] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: So to sum up, .preventDefault() doesn't have anything to do with event bubbling
[13:20:18] <jehoshua02> One line of code: window.location = $.param.querystring(url, {fadein: true});
[13:20:22] <rubberneck> I guess I should ask if this is a jquery thnig, or just a javascript thing?
[13:20:30] <jehoshua02> Thanks.
[13:20:35] <Eviltwin> It's just a way of telling the browser to not do its default action when the event listeners are done
[13:21:00] <Eviltwin> .stopPropagation() stops it from going to the parents and above but does not stop the other listeners on this element itself from firing
[13:21:08] <Eviltwin> jQuery adds .stopImmediatePropagation() which does do that
[13:21:14] <Eviltwin> It means the currently event listener will be the last to fire
[13:21:35] <Eviltwin> Regardless of hierarchy
[13:21:53] <Whirl3d> lol, I had a typo in stopPropOgation, my bad. That is more what I thought was supposed to happen
[13:22:11] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I make that mistake too sometimes
[13:22:19] <Eviltwin> Getting better though
[13:25:09] <Whirl3d> if the pattern for .on is $(elem).on("click",sel,function(e) {}), what is the object notation version $(elem).on({click:function (e) {}, mousedown:function (e) {}});  (where's the target selector in the object verion)
[13:25:33] <Whirl3d> *version
[13:25:41] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It's very clear on the api.jquery.com page for .on
[13:26:03] <Eviltwin> And I'm specifically not telling or linking you
[13:26:45] <Whirl3d> Whatever
[13:26:49] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your help

[13:34:23] <nyash> hi, how do I check for an existence of an element after a page loaded? I want to attach a setTimeout function. Is it $(element).on("load", dosomething) ?
[13:34:37] <aaronmcadam> please use it
[13:34:39] <Jquery> say notch is awesome
[13:34:42] <Jquery> also try <b>

[13:35:30] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[13:35:34] <solidus-river> also are there any triggers i can use to check if an element has been scrolled to or if the scroll bar has reached within X percent of the top?
[13:35:37] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: i like having it
[13:35:38] <Jquery> ill give you a slap
[13:35:46] <aaronmcadam> hmm?

[13:35:50] <Jquery> arron

[13:35:55] <Jquery> arron eats dead eat
[13:35:58] <Jquery> from the rubbish bin
[13:36:03] <aaronmcadam> kick that prick
[13:36:06] <eddiemonge> solidus-river: you can check the window.scroll
[13:36:09] <NeoMatrixJR> is that thing a bot?  wow that's annoying.  Anyways.  If anyone can help I'm having a problem making an ajax query.  I need to send a request to an https url that then processes the request server-side and redirects to an http page (all in same domain) with the results.
[13:36:10] <Jquery> eviltwin
[13:36:32] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: Is the site HTTPS?
[13:36:35] <Jquery> i find it sad you are all day on here nothing else to do, ey?
[13:36:44] <csmrfx> What kind of function would randomize value 0-20px to textshadow at random 200-5000 millisecond intervals?
[13:36:45] <NeoMatrixJR> no, the query is sent from an http page
[13:36:47] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: what i want is i have a scrollabe list of elements, when the user scrolls to the top (either the top element becomes visible or the scrollbar reaches the top, i want to load the next X set of elements into the list
[13:36:59] * Jquery will slap Eviltwin
[13:37:00] <nyash> Ok. Basically what I am trying to do is this: Page renders -> Check if a div exists -> setTimeout to remove it after 500 milliseconds
[13:37:08] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: You can't make an AJAX request from http://domain:port to https://domain:port
[13:37:10] <eddiemonge> solidus-river: you mean when they reach the bottom ala FB style?
[13:37:15] <Eviltwin> It's one of the three things that needs to match for SOP
[13:37:17] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: see ?sop
[13:37:18] <bot-t> NeoMatrixJR, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:37:30] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: yes, but FB does it when they reach the top
[13:37:30] <aaronmcadam> nyash that's simple yeah
[13:37:44] <eddiemonge> nyash: do the .length check and then set the timeout in the if block
[13:37:55] <solidus-river> i guess i could add a check on the .scroll handler of the object
[13:37:57] <Jquery> Use the estimated heat to predicct the center of the origin in order to absorb the cold. also, by doing this oyu will be rewarded by the <b> tag
[13:38:03] <solidus-river> but it sounds like that would be much slower than a trigger
[13:38:08] <aaronmcadam> you'd wanna debounce that thp

[13:38:39] <Eviltwin> Trying to get in his last bit of assholeness
[13:38:45] <Eviltwin> After he sees the +o
[13:38:49] <danheberden> Eviltwin reg your username
[13:38:53] <danheberden> i tried to op you
[13:38:59] * chee rs!
[13:38:59] <ajpiano> yea
[13:38:59] <Eviltwin> I thought I was reg'd
[13:39:02] <Eviltwin> Let me see
[13:39:16] <danheberden> oh
[13:39:17] <danheberden> wait
[13:39:19] <danheberden> i might have goofed
[13:39:32] <danheberden> there we go
[13:39:36] <Eviltwin> Thanks
[13:39:50] <NeoMatrixJR> Eviltwin: should firebug be able to track a request even if it's SOP?  Firebug is showing the request going out and a 302 being returned.
[13:40:16] <eddiemonge> nyash: look into scrollTo i think that is what you want
[13:40:21] <Eviltwin> And it went away again
[13:40:34] <ajpiano> what the crap was that about
[13:40:37] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: Can you walk me through the chain of URLs again?
[13:40:57] <eddiemonge> NeoMatrixJR: is the page actually 302'ing?
[13:41:07] <ccushing> what's the correct way to set the HTTP Header Content-Type
[13:41:20] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: The way XHR works is that if it seamlessly follows redirects unless they violate SOP
[13:41:26] <Eviltwin> that it*
[13:41:31] <ccushing> application/x-www-form-urlencoded < I appear to be receiving this
[13:41:43] <ccushing> but I need to be receiving application/json
[13:41:51] <Eviltwin> ccushing: Server side?
[13:41:59] <ajpiano> lol i just banned him for 6 months
[13:42:06] <Eviltwin> Nice
[13:42:16] <ccushing> Eviltwin client side for some wonderul form stuff
[13:42:23] <aaronmcadam> hehe good man ajpiano :)
[13:42:30] <Eviltwin> ccushing: Are you using $.ajax?
[13:42:37] <aaronmcadam> he said I eat meat from a rubbish bin :(
[13:42:59] <Eviltwin> I really don't understand how trolls have the time
[13:43:01] <ccushing> Eviltwin that's a good question... I'm trying to fix the UI guy... hmm
[13:43:02] <aaronmcadam> Renegade001: hey how's the wesht
[13:43:12] <NeoMatrixJR> ok, full load out, loading an http page/form in a colorbox (ajax'd that in just fine...). Both the host page and the called form are on http://www.domainx.com.  Submit button in form triggers ajax request to https://www.domainx.com:443.  That page server-side processes request and redirects to http://www.domainx.com
[13:43:23] <Renegade001> The wesht?
[13:43:27] <aaronmcadam> well maybe not
[13:43:36] <aaronmcadam> been watchin too much Hardy Bucks lately
[13:43:44] <eddiemonge> ccushing: thats funny. "fix the ui guy"
[13:43:47] <aaronmcadam> forgot where mullingar actually is :D
[13:43:52] <Renegade001> You're from Ireland too? :D
[13:44:02] <Renegade001> shure who isn't, boi?
[13:44:04] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah I live in england tho
[13:44:09] <aaronmcadam> haha
[13:44:14] <Eviltwin> NeoMatrixJR: And you're getting the response from the first request but not the redirect?
[13:44:19] <aaronmcadam> goaaan
[13:44:36] <ccushing> eddiemonge yeah probably, I'm just trying to figure out how I can tell him... please do this thing to change the headers of your ajax request
[13:44:39] <Renegade001> Ah the whest!
[13:44:49] <Renegade001> I'm in the middle, ya know
[13:44:50] <aaronmcadam> bit more civil down your way now hi
[13:45:04] <aaronmcadam> "shivil"
[13:45:11] <eddiemonge> ccushing: why is a ui designer touching ajax requests?
[13:45:12] <NackNick> can someone tell me what im doing wrong in my code im trying to use multiple forms on one page and it not quite working out right http://pastebin.com/5JZWJdQQ
[13:45:53] <NeoMatrixJR> Eviltwin: according to firebug I get response headers to the request to https://www.domainx.com:443.  The status shows 302 Redirect.  From what I can debug out of jQuery I get a status 0, statusText "error"
[13:45:55] <ccushing> eddiemonge because we're all on crack here?
[13:46:07] <eddiemonge> NackNick: cache $(this) and your lines 10 and 11 are broken
[13:46:11] <eddiemonge> and 17-18
[13:46:13] <ccushing> eddiemonge why do I have to set up my own test servers... idfk
[13:46:30] <eddiemonge> ccushing: mockjax
[13:46:41] <aaronmcadam> Sinon looks nice too
[13:47:10] <solidus-river> eddiemonge: i think i got it, attach a handler to the scroll even to see if the element's scrollTop() is less than X% of the elements total .height()
[13:47:21] <NackNick> broken like how?
[13:47:27] <NackNick> im not getting any errors
[13:47:43] <eddiemonge> NackNick: ?jsfiddle
[13:47:47] <eddiemonge> NackNick: see ? jsfiddle
[13:47:47] <bot-t> NackNick, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[13:47:57] <NackNick> im using dreamweaver
[13:48:15] <aaronmcadam> solidus-river: debounce it too though for perf: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/throttle/
[13:50:42] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: nice! i'd never heard of throttle before, thats an awesome function
[13:51:11] <NackNick> jsfiddle doesnt show errors
[13:51:29] <Eviltwin> NackNick: Let's see
[13:51:42] <aaronmcadam> NackNick: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/q8Qdb/
[13:51:54] <aaronmcadam> NackNick: that's how to mock ajax with jsfiddle
[13:52:25] <aaronmcadam> solidus-river: yeah ben alman strikes again. you need it cuz the scroll event fires like crazy
[13:52:43] <nexion> is there a way to tell between .scroll(e) events generated by the user dragging the scrollbar vs those generated  by jQuery's animate?
[13:52:58] <NackNick> http://jsfiddle.net/qY4jG/
[13:54:11] <NackNick> ...
[13:54:18] <NackNick> im not trying to use ajax
[13:54:26] <NackNick> its a simple validation form

[14:00:01] <neteffect> hi
[14:00:11] <dtrenz> hi
[14:00:35] <dtrenz> Could anyone here help me understand the on() method?
[14:00:50] <neteffect> $(".b:even").css.....
[14:01:12] <dtrenz> More specifically, how it can supersede .delegate() when it doesn't appear to support future binding?
[14:02:04] <aaronmcadam> dtrenz: what do you mean "future binding!
[14:02:11] <aaronmcadam> s/!/"
[14:02:54] <aaronmcadam> you mean live events?
[14:03:11] <dtrenz> yes
[14:03:15] <dtrenz> " Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future"
[14:03:21] <aaronmcadam> right cool
[14:03:28] <aaronmcadam> on *does* support it
[14:03:28] <dtrenz> on() doesn't care about the future, right?
[14:03:35] <aaronmcadam> that's wrong
[14:03:36] <dtrenz> "*does*"
[14:03:52] <aaronmcadam> depending on your method signature
[14:04:06] <dtrenz> method signature?
[14:04:07] <aaronmcadam> it will just bind with propagation or use delegation on a given context
[14:04:11] <aaronmcadam> umm
[14:04:20] <aaronmcadam> func( a, b, c )
[14:04:24] <aaronmcadam> that's a method sig
[14:04:27] <dtrenz> ah, right
[14:04:39] <menoyo> i am getting json back. I can access the data if i do something like data[0][0].name, but is there anyway can do this where name is a string. Something like data[0][0]["name"]?
[14:05:08] <aaronmcadam> dtrenz: $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(event){ ... }
[14:05:15] <aaronmcadam> dtrenz: delegation
[14:05:32] <aaronmcadam> dtrenz: propagation: $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(event){
[14:05:32] <dtrenz> hmm
[14:05:52] <aaronmcadam> sorry wrong code sample for the 2nd one ha
[14:06:07] <dtrenz> i don't see the difference
[14:06:09] <dtrenz> ah, ok
[14:06:15] <aaronmcadam> dtrenz: $("button").on("click", notify);
[14:06:20] <aaronmcadam> see
[14:06:22] <aaronmcadam> the difference
[14:06:28] <dtrenz> yes
[14:06:33] <aaronmcadam> you're not specifying a context in the propagation one
[14:07:21] <dtrenz> aaronmcadam: so w/ a selector, you get delegation?
[14:07:29] <phlp> isnt that backwards? delegate works by propagation
[14:07:39] <dtrenz> aaronmcadam: w/o selector, it's just like bind()?
[14:07:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah basically
[14:10:03] <dtrenz> aaronmcadam: Cool, I think i get it now.  Thanks for your help.
[14:10:09] <aaronmcadam> np
[14:11:36] <menoyo> I'm trying to parse my Json.  data[0][0].name works, but is there anyway can do this where name is a string instead of statically typed? Something like data[0][0]["name"]?
[14:12:04] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[14:12:06] <aaronmcadam> that should work
[14:12:45] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var j = { a : 1, b : 2 }; return j.a
[14:12:45] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: return not in function
[14:12:50] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var j = { a : 1, b : 2 };  j.a
[14:12:51] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[14:12:57] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var j = { a : 1, b : 2 };  j['a']
[14:12:58] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[14:13:04] <aaronmcadam> menoyo: ^^
[14:13:24] <menoyo> wth, i had typed exactly what i had and it wasn't working. I must have done something else stupid
[14:13:55] <aaronmcadam> double check your key variable
[14:14:21] <menoyo> it works now, i just don't know what happened to make it work. Maybe something was still in the cache
[14:14:33] <aaronmcadam> cool
[14:15:01] <neteffect> $("document").ready(function()
[14:15:40] <aaronmcadam> neteffect: document is an object not a string
[14:15:44] <neteffect> k
[14:15:55] <aaronmcadam> so remove the quotes
[14:16:53] <daniel_> can i do this to access a password field in a form?           $.post(window.location.pathname + '/protect', { newpassword: $(this).closest('form').('#password').val() } );
[14:17:30] <daniel_> the .('#password') is where i believe im going wrong
[14:17:46] <daniel_> need a function in there
[14:18:02] <neteffect> wow
[14:19:28] <Tobbi> Hey. Can anyone tell me why evt.altKey or evt.CtrlKey won't work anymore inside a live handler? I keep getting ((f.event.special[r.origType]|| {}).handle || r.handler).apply is not a function in the console.
[14:19:30] <aaronmcadam> daniel_: find()
[14:19:36] <Tobbi> Has anyone ever tried that out lately?
[14:19:43] <daniel_> thanks aaronmcadam
[14:19:49] <Eviltwin> Tobbi: You're doing something else wrong
[14:20:01] <aaronmcadam> Tobbi: you might nee3d to access originalEvent
[14:20:13] <Tobbi> aaronmcadam: Okay, let me see...
[14:20:21] <aaronmcadam> log out the event obj to see
[14:21:05] <daniel_> Resource interpreted as Other but transferred with MIME type undefined.
[14:22:15] <Tobbi> hold on, I'll log the event to the console.
[14:23:02] <aaronmcadam> daniel_: I've seen something similar before, are you setting type="text/javascript" if it's an xhtml doc?
[14:25:48] <nodestool> how would i use $.live() to bind to like a 'complete' or 'load' type of event, basically as soon as the object is done being created i want to do something with it
[14:26:07] <daniel_> yeah aaronmcadam, im actually using the clojure/hiccup include-js helper
[14:26:26] <nodestool> kinda like $(document).ready() but for selected objects like $(".foo").ready(){}
[14:26:26] <aaronmcadam> java stack?
[14:27:13] <aaronmcadam> nodestool: that's not exactly possible, but if there's a function that creates the objects, u could use pubsub to tell when they get created
[14:27:29] <nodestool> aaronmcadam: pubsub?
[14:28:00] <aaronmcadam> nodestool: https://gist.github.com/1321768
[14:28:44] <daniel_> aaronmcadam: i'm writing something like (include-js "js/myscript.js") and it's creating the html for me...with type=text/javascript
[14:30:15] <daniel_>         $('#setpass').submit(function() {
[14:30:15] <daniel_>           $.post(window.location.pathname + '/protect', { newpassword: $(this).closest('form').find('#password').val() });
[14:30:18] <daniel_>         });
[14:30:51] <daniel_> i get Resource interpreted as Other but transferred with MIME type undefined. in the console when i submit
[14:32:47] <Tobbi> I think my problem was that I was binding to the input event instead of keypress...Ctrl keypresses don't have an effect on the input event whatsoever.
[14:34:29] <aaronmcadam> Tobbi: give this a quick go if u want: http://robertwhurst.github.com/KeyboardJS/
[14:37:43] <Tobbi> hmm, might be useful...
[14:48:44] <zeejy> Can anyone explain the relationship between the helper element and actual element when working with jQuery sortables?
[14:49:56] <thinkclay> is there a function like .each() that can be used on custom objects rather than DOM?
[14:51:02] <zeejy> @thinkclay Do you mean is there a way to iterate over all the keys in an object literal?
[14:51:07] <thinkclay> ya
[14:51:32] <zeejy> You can just use a for
[14:51:48] <thinkclay> for ( key in object ) .. yep just found that :)
[14:51:56] <zeejy> cool :)
[14:51:57] <thinkclay> thanks
[14:52:17] <kggle> hey, i want to move a div contained in #container into #betterplace, how to do that? cant find something on docs
[14:54:01] <zeejy> @kggle Depends on what you're trying to do, but look at the .clone() method
[14:54:23] <kggle> yeah, i already got that clone, but then i have to clone -> append -> and remove the old one. hmm
[14:55:09] <zeejy> Yeah, you're going to have to remove the old one no matter what
[14:55:21] <kggle> ok, thought there is a magic ;)
[14:55:25] <zeejy> I don't think jQuery has a moveTo or anything like that
[14:55:50] <kggle> ok, thanks zeejy
[14:56:15] <ajpiano> kggle: appendTo will move it,
[14:56:20] <ajpiano> you don't have to clone it and then rmove the old one
[14:56:27] <ajpiano> just $("#foo").appendTo("#bar") will move foo
[14:56:43] <kggle> ajpiano, nice, thanks!
[14:57:01] <webPragmatist> any anythingslider users ever tried something like jQuery('#d-600x388-widget-rotator').data('AnythingSlider').bind(...

[15:15:20] <html_novice> hi.. is there a way to detect if a user has "always show scrollbars" turned on in mac os? i'd like to adjust my iframe size so the content within is always exactly 480px wide
[15:16:26] <html_novice> example of what i'm trying to fix (notice second image layout is broken because the scrollbar eats up 20px or so) http://i.imgur.com/sWovy.png
[15:22:49] <Eviltwin> html_novice: Maybe something like this: http://www.alexandre-gomes.com/?p=115
[15:25:17] <shoelessone> what's the best strategy for fading images out on top of each other? Anybody have any good tips?
[15:27:31] <Spadeski> Sup sup
[15:27:59] <shoelessone> Spadeski: Bup bup
[15:28:17] <Spadeski> Shouelessone How's the day been for ya ??
[15:29:00] <html_novice> Eviltwin: thanks
[15:33:28] <shoelessone> Spadeski: Not bad, overall. Less stressful then some days, more stressful then others!
[15:33:31] <shoelessone> Spadeski: how about yours?
[15:34:09] <mwhudson> if i call .button() on a checkbox, and i want to get the widget instance object later, how can i do that?
[15:34:33] <mwhudson> (the checkbox has an id, so $("#checkbox") gets the checkbox, but that's not the widget)
[15:36:14] <Spadeski> shoelessone: pretty good, got no sleep but got alot of work done today hopefully more sleep and production today
[15:37:30] <shoelessone> I didn't FEEL like I got a lot of sleep, but that's only because, well, I don't know
[15:38:04] <shoelessone> Spadeski: basically, I was woken up by my mother at 6 AM calling about something... she's on the east coast (well, midwest) and I'm in California, and sometimes she doesn't remember I think
[15:38:07] <shoelessone> which is an honest mistake!
[15:39:53] <catcher> I'm having issues with mouseenter/mouseleave via delegate on a link. Whenever I go over it quickly, it seems to store up my transitions and run through them all. I've tried calling .stop() before my .fadeIn(), and then I get different issues (my fadein stops working altogether, or only fades in partially). Any ideas?
[15:41:28] <bot-t> catcher, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[15:42:49] <Spadeski> shoelessone:  That sucks if I wasnt 17 i'd feel bad for ya lol
[15:43:58] <shoelessone> Spadeski: 17, that's a pretty good age, IMO. You don't have to worry about family calling you too early!
[15:44:02] <shoelessone> Also, are you in school right now?
[15:44:59] <Spadeski> shoelessone:  lol nah I got a twin too do that for me cept he comes in the other room fuckiing anoyin as shit too

[15:45:53] <craigwhite> How do I send data back to the server in the form of  /groups/ID/add_member/richard...    right now, I've got $.post( "groups/ID/add_member", ['group', ui.draggable.text()] ); and it's clear that ui.draggable.text(() has the 'richard' value
[16:07:37] <dogarrhea2> so i have this really dynamic page... everything moves around draggable/animating playing sound etc.
[16:07:59] <dogarrhea2> how much static html should i actually have? should i just create everything in jquery? $("everything")??
[16:12:02] <bribroder> what if someone came to your page with javascript disabled?
[16:12:11] <bribroder> imagine what they should see
[16:12:13] <Aric> I'm looking at Twitter's Bootstrap's .modal() and trying to make a way to skip opening the modal if already opened
[16:13:03] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: If you know what's going to be in the page at or near load, I would have those things be in the page
[16:14:45] <dogarrhea2> ok. seems like a really really minor optimzation
[16:14:56] <dogarrhea2> i would be building something from 1 static html thing and then cloning it as the user sees fit
[16:15:08] <dogarrhea2> eh i'll worry about it later

[17:16:26] <abjorn> *shrug* guess I'll just reply back asking about it
[17:16:29] <abjorn> so wassap imsky
[17:16:33] <abjorn> wat u up to
[17:16:40] <imsky> writing some kwerys
[17:16:49] <imsky> watching the wwdc 2005 keynote
[17:17:48] <imsky> just saw something about node having a new site and amber/ember.js
[17:18:07] <abjorn> why are you watching that
[17:18:14] <abjorn> oh snap
[17:18:16] <dogarrhea2> what's ember.js
[17:18:16] <abjorn> they did update the site
[17:18:27] <abjorn> cool the node site isn't crap anymore
[17:18:29] <dogarrhea2> i tried visiting their site to find out and it was not found
[17:18:55] <imsky> the wwdc keynotes are kind of nice. basically, gmail/google's UI paradigms are all taken from 2003, and os x features then
[17:19:41] <imsky> so in a way it's nice to see how things have developed since then and where they might go, if they follow the same path
[17:20:32] <imsky> dogarrhea2: it's sproutcore v2
[17:21:18] <dogarrhea2> that is also 503 service unavailable
[17:21:27] <dogarrhea2> "desktop caliber webapps" sounds like an oxymoron
[17:21:32] <imsky> your dns might be screwed
[17:22:14] <imsky> lol, steve explains to everyone what wikipedia is
[17:22:58] <dogarrhea2> http://blog.sproutcore.com/ seems to work for me. not sproutcore.com
[17:23:19] <imsky> http://www.emberjs.com/ broheim
[17:23:34] <dogarrhea2> cannot find :(
[17:23:41] <imsky> lol
[17:24:06] <abjorn> ipconfig /flushdns
[17:25:34] <dogarrhea2> dscacheutil -flushcache   for me..
[17:25:46] <dogarrhea2> o well i think our network is messed up
[17:25:52] <imsky> oh shit i think steve's about to announce the transition to intel
[17:25:54] <dogarrhea2> my next door cube mate can't find it
[17:26:14] <dogarrhea2> Steve who?
[17:26:32] <imsky> yep, he is
[17:27:38] <abjorn> lol
[17:28:04] <imsky> whole room is quiet
[17:28:20] <abjorn> psh mr mac user dogarrhea2 :p
[17:28:23] <imsky> steve explains that powerpc performance/watt is 1/6th that of intel's
[17:28:35] <dogarrhea2> abjorn this is kind of computer they gave me.
[17:28:44] <abjorn> I figured, I'm just kidding
[17:28:53] <dogarrhea2> i thought steve jobs was dead
[17:29:04] <abjorn> he's watching a 2005 video
[17:29:06] <dogarrhea2> how is he comparing powerpc to pc
[17:29:11] <dogarrhea2> oh
[17:29:23] <abjorn> http://internetsupervision.com/scripts/urlcheck/check.aspx?lan=en-US&checkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emberjs.com%2F&email=%5BEnter+Your+Email+Address%5D
[17:29:23] <abjorn> Yeah it's def your connection
[17:29:33] <imsky> lolwut
[17:29:34] <abjorn> go bitch to your IT ppl
[17:29:41] <imsky> http://isup.me/emberjs.com
[17:29:48] <dogarrhea2> yea i am connected to some other network via vpn..
[17:29:56] <dogarrhea2> which i need for work o well i'll disc
[17:30:41] <abjorn> anyways, envato was/is doing some huge sale on a big back of game resources, i got some good sprites for a space shooter, so im working on that tonight in impact :3
[17:30:52] <imsky> holy shit. steve reveals that os x has been compiled for intel since 2001
[17:31:20] <imsky> i think a year to this guy is like a week to most people
[17:31:22] <dogarrhea2> hrm reading about ember.js something that concerns me: "Downloads everything so you never have to go to server again"
[17:31:40] <dogarrhea2> what's the difference between that and some 16 mb flash app embedding all sound in there at once
[17:32:15] <abjorn> ones native browser stuff and open, one isn't
[17:32:28] <imsky> haha everyone's feeling so awkward as steve shows that the mac he's been using for the keynote runs a pentium 4
[17:32:58] <abjorn> why would they feel awkward
[17:33:02] <abjorn> intel > ppc
[17:33:09] <imsky> not really true
[17:33:12] <abjorn> although
[17:33:13] <abjorn> tbh
[17:33:16] <abjorn> amd masterrace here
[17:33:18] <imsky> previous keynotes showed the g4/g5 smoking pentiums and xeons
[17:33:22] <imsky> no, amd sucks
[17:33:29] <imsky> there can be only 1
[17:33:31] <abjorn> amd is awesome, more bang for your buck
[17:33:31] <dogarrhea2> bulldozer vs 2600k
[17:33:59] <imsky> amd is for people with lights in their cases
[17:34:07] * abjorn looks at his case
[17:34:12] * abjorn it has lights
[17:34:30] <abjorn> lemme put it this way, intels most powerful processor is probably maybe 10% more powerful than amd's most powerful, and like twice the price
[17:34:37] <imsky> highest passmark for a cpu to date is core i7-3960x, almost brand new, 15K. highest AMD on that list has 8.3K
[17:34:38] <abjorn> I don't need the most powerful, so for me amd > intel
[17:34:41] <imsky> ^
[17:34:57] <imsky> 2x the power, and it'll get cheaper with time
[17:35:08] <abjorn> and so will amd's
[17:35:28] <imsky> bro, the stack is ms/intel/nvidia
[17:35:44] <dogarrhea2> eh intel is beating amd in processors amd beating in graphics card
[17:35:50] <abjorn> The fact is going to remain, with AMD you get more power for your money. It's less power, but I can live with that if I don't have to sell my future children.
[17:35:51] <imsky> amd's not beating anyone in gpus
[17:35:58] <imsky> geforce > amd, intel > amd
[17:36:30] <imsky> lol abjorn if you buy cpu's retail, you're going to get screwed
[17:36:32] <heshanh> is it possible to emulate and event, i have afunction taht triggers on .change, is there a way i can triger the it witout actaully chaning it
[17:36:40] <heshanh> changing*
[17:36:47] <abjorn> imsky: I buy from newegg, works for me.
[17:36:54] <imsky> yeah, you pay retail prices
[17:36:59] <imsky> that's who amd targets
[17:37:05] <imsky> system builders get rock bottom prices on both brands
[17:37:19] <imsky> so intel is very affordable
[17:37:22] <abjorn> yeah theeeyyy get rock bottom prices. not meeeeee
[17:37:29] <abjorn> I don't want some prefab computer
[17:37:31] <abjorn> unless
[17:37:32] <abjorn> its laptop
[17:37:38] <imsky> eh..i gave up the whole "build it all myself" thing a while ago
[17:37:40] <abjorn> and fuck no i aint gettin no amd laptop
[17:37:50] <imsky> i order a prebuilt pc, swap out the low-quality components, and i'm golden
[17:38:08] <perverse`> seems a bit wasteful
[17:38:11] <imsky> how
[17:38:18] <imsky> i get a whole pc for 2x what the cpu costs
[17:38:27] <imsky> with ridiculously good specs and great bench scores
[17:38:35] <imsky> i swap the psu, get a new gpu, and i'm set
[17:38:41] <perverse`> i dont get what you mean at all
[17:38:51] <imsky> maybe someday you will
[17:38:51] <dogarrhea2> sounds like waste to me too.
[17:38:53] <abjorn> Since when do prefabs have great bench scores? What company we talkin bout?
[17:38:58] <perverse`> oh, clever imsky
[17:39:04] <imsky> abjorn: not talking about dell/gateway etc
[17:39:05] <perverse`> you have a very narrow world view
[17:39:07] <perverse`> lol
[17:39:07] <imsky> talking about system builders
[17:39:12] <dogarrhea2> "I go to the buffet to get all the food. then I go to a 5 star restaurant to finish my meal"
[17:39:58] <imsky> just looked it up, the cpu in my pc costs $339. my whole config, with new components, cost roughly around $1000
[17:40:35] <imsky> but hey, you guys can pay the 20-30% retail overhead ;)
[17:41:09] <perverse`> i would say the many people here build their own boxes from scratch, most at wholsesale price
[17:41:12] <perverse`> myself included
[17:41:31] <imsky> i'd say you're wrong. i've built from scratch twice before, and it's expensive. system builders get better rates
[17:41:47] <perverse`> system builders get wholesale rates
[17:42:02] <imsky> no shit brah, and they don't send out DOA systems either
[17:42:05] <perverse`> anyone with a business account can get that, in my case i use my works wholesale account
[17:42:16] <imsky> whereas if your stick of mushkin/gskill/corsair is DOA, you gotta RMA that POS
[17:42:37] <abjorn> psh, like gskill is ever doa
[17:42:41] <abjorn> now CRUCIAL...
[17:42:43] <perverse`> you think system builders don't send out faulty parts?
[17:42:44] <imsky> perverse`: good for you bro. what are you arguing then? that it's cool to fuck around in a case for 2 hours?
[17:43:00] <abjorn> system builders test first perverce`
[17:43:01] <perverse`> im arguing that you're narrow minded, and can't see past your own opinion and use cases
[17:43:05] <imsky> abjorn: +1
[17:43:14] <imsky> perverse`: i don't think you know what narrowminded means
[17:43:18] <abjorn> They'll get DOA parts, but replace it before they give it to you.
[17:43:25] <kenthree> $('<img src="a.gif">'); triggers a media request, any way to avoid that?
[17:43:25] <perverse`> and you cant' seem to accept that there is no "right" and "wrong"
[17:43:28] <perverse`> in this case
[17:43:35] <dogarrhea2> 1000$ + 200$ for graphics card = about the same amount i'd pay for a custom build it yourself thing
[17:43:39] <perverse`> what works for the goose doesnt necessarily work for the gander
[17:43:43] <imsky> perverse`: i don't remember saying my way was right, i just know it's better
[17:43:43] <dogarrhea2> with a 6990 in it
[17:43:52] <dogarrhea2> er 6970
[17:43:56] <imsky> and better in my book, is better for my bank account
[17:44:00] <perverse`> 12:43 imsky • perverse`: i don't remember saying my way was right, i just know it's better <- lol, hilarious
[17:44:05] <perverse`> you're a funny kid
[17:44:11] <imsky> perverse`: ok brah, have fun being condescending
[17:44:33] <perverse`> have fun knowing you're right
[17:44:35] <perverse`> lol
[17:44:44] <imsky> that actually sounds like fun, that's what i do
[17:44:53] <perverse`> hahaha
[17:45:04] <perverse`> it sure is
[17:45:26] <abjorn> hm. well my current build took about $700. Not gonna be topping the charts in performance, but I never have any lag issues (except booting because fuckin windows). And that works for me.
[17:45:47] <perverse`> don't waste your time, abjorn
[17:45:57] <abjorn> ?
[17:46:14] <abjorn> waste my time how
[17:46:31] <perverse`> if you're trying to justify yourself to imsky - just don't bother is all im saying
[17:46:39] <dogarrhea2> time to pick up my shit
[17:46:41] <perverse`> stick with what works for you
[17:46:43] <dogarrhea2> from ups.
[17:47:02] <abjorn> I never waste my time talking to imsky
[17:47:08] <imsky> yeah we actually hate each other
[17:47:11] <abjorn> ya
[17:47:14] <imsky> like so deeply
[17:47:15] <ajpiano> you guys just cuddle every day
[17:47:16] <ajpiano> that's all

[17:49:32] <imsky> haaha
[17:49:39] <LessSeen> <_< k.
[17:49:39] <imsky> D; to be exact
[17:49:46] <abjorn> I think it was a typo
[17:49:50] <ajpiano> this is getting so bizarre, can we just go back to talking about jquery problems
[17:49:53] <abjorn> because I can't make that face
[17:50:02] <perverse`> yeah, this dick touching shit is fucking gay, bye

[17:50:51] <imsky> that's why i'm on the internet
[17:50:57] <imsky> saying "no homo" makes you suspect in my eyes
[17:51:03] <LessSeen> haha ok
[17:51:07] <abjorn> I know.
[17:51:09] * LessSeen stays
[17:51:09] <abjorn> That's why I did it.
[17:51:19] <imsky> also saying "pause"
[17:53:18] <imsky> wait a sec
[17:53:23] <imsky> in all the hubbub i missed this
[17:53:36] <imsky> "perverse`: would u liek to touch my penis?"   then   "perverse`: yeah, this dick touching shit is fucking gay, bye"
[17:53:43] <abjorn> lol
[17:53:56] <imsky> looool
[17:54:04] <ajpiano> can we change the subj
[17:54:05] <ajpiano> plz
[17:54:11] <imsky> how red is your hair today adam
[17:54:18] <ajpiano> about at 9
[17:54:24] <imsky> is it snowing in nyc?
[17:54:28] <imsky> i'm too lazy to check
[17:54:31] <vsmith> can anyone in here help me on some errors i am getting  and point me in the right direction in fixing them?
[17:54:32] <solidus-river> $('some selector').find('li[data-first]') will find the li elements with data-first assigned to them, correct?
[17:54:40] <imsky> wtf where did you people with problems come from
[17:54:47] <abjorn> Sometimes I wish it would snow here
[17:54:52] <abjorn> then I remember that snow is cold
[17:55:04] <ajpiano> solidus-river: yes
[17:55:13] <vsmith> I am getting errors on my site about non existing functions that used to exist.
[17:55:22] <imsky> sounds about right then, vsmith
[17:55:26] <abjorn> whereat
[17:55:29] <vsmith> I am a jquery novice
[17:55:34] <abjorn> das kew, so is imsky
[17:55:47] <abjorn> got an example or anything we can look at?
[17:55:48] <imsky> i am a jaekwery mcse certified pro
[17:56:11] <vsmith> imsky could you point me in the right direction
[17:56:16] <imsky> yes, http://google.com
[17:56:33] <ajpiano> imsky: don't be a jerk, you can't be like, reallllllllly off topic *and* not helpful
[17:56:43] <abjorn> giving us a link or putting it on jsfiddle.net
[17:56:46] <abjorn> would be a good start
[17:56:48] <solidus-river> how do i check the state of a data attribute on the $(this) object within a callback handler for an event :\
[17:56:52] <imsky> ajpiano: ok you called me out on it, tell me what his problem is exactly, and i'll be 200% more helpful
[17:56:54] <abjorn> we need some context to give any help
[17:57:02] <vsmith> i thought this channel was for technical help with jquery?
[17:57:12] <vsmith> okay
[17:57:17] <imsky> usually we help with problems more concrete than "my functions used to exist"
[17:57:22] <abjorn> $(this).attr('data-whateverman') @ solidus-river
[17:57:40] <imsky> what if data is an object
[17:57:45] <vsmith> this is the site: http://shafteldms.diamondbuyers.com/
[17:57:46] <imsky> is the attribute still set
[17:57:52] <imsky> I MUST KNOW THIS
[17:57:53] <abjorn> no then everything blows up
[17:58:01] <abjorn> and you die
[17:58:15] <vsmith> i recently made a wordpress update which includes the newest jquery
[17:58:21] <imsky> pls sir
[17:58:24] <vsmith> and my plugins broke
[17:58:30] <imsky> abjorn: called it
[17:58:35] <vsmith> in fire bug the errors I  see are
[17:58:42] <vsmith> $ is not a function
[17:58:47] <abjorn> use jQuery
[17:58:53] <vsmith> jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[17:58:56] <abjorn> they're doing $.noConflict
[17:59:06] <imsky> 1.4.4 is not the latest version
[17:59:10] <abjorn> lol
[17:59:31] <abjorn> well, either they're doing $.noConflict or the order in which these files are included on the page has been changed
[18:00:03] <abjorn> or some jerky scripter guy was like lolol i trol you and did "jQuery = undefined"
[18:00:13] <imsky> i troll u *
[18:00:27] <abjorn> so you're admitting you did it then, imsky?
[18:00:27] <vsmith> okay i have heard of $.noConflict but l have  little experience
[18:00:40] <abjorn> Basically, $ is a shorthand for the jQuery object
[18:00:43] <vsmith> with jQuery
[18:00:44] <abjorn> but other libraries like using it too
[18:00:49] <imsky> abjorn: http://i.minus.com/ibrH270IqkC9xs.gif
[18:00:49] <vsmith> okay
[18:00:57] <abjorn> so $.noConflict lets you allow other libraries to use it
[18:01:36] <coldhead> abjorn, imsky: http://kitcambridge.github.com/evil.js/
[18:01:43] <vsmith> okay, did you see the page possibly abjorn
[18:01:51] <abjorn> yeah
[18:01:57] <imsky> coldhead: saw it, thx
[18:01:57] <abjorn> well
[18:01:57] <kenthree> min.us changed their domain?
[18:02:00] <abjorn> i saw what the errors were
[18:02:03] <imsky> kenthree: for a while now
[18:02:07] <imsky> they bought it, didn't change it
[18:02:22] <kenthree> i remember the reddit post of the guy trying to compete with imgur
[18:02:27] <imsky> yeah, he won
[18:02:31] <imsky> imgur is slow titties by comparison
[18:02:38] <vsmith> how would I go about correcting them.  do i need to add some type of wrapper
[18:02:43] <vsmith> ?
[18:02:54] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[18:02:57] <imsky> abjorn: i love the <style> tag embedded casually inside <body>
[18:03:05] <imsky> and <br class="clear">
[18:03:12] <coldhead> imsky: can you put your browser history online somewhere so i can see everything you've ever looked at and not waste yor precious time?
[18:03:19] <abjorn> lol
[18:03:22] <imsky> coldhead: i said thx you bitter mongrel
[18:03:41] <coldhead> if i had ops and was 20 years younger i would kick you for insolence
[18:03:42] <vsmith> What does this mean â€”>  $(document).ready(function(){
[18:03:48] <abjorn> coldhead: his browser history is up, its called facebook
[18:03:58] <imsky> coldhead: that's why irc sucks
[18:03:59] <coldhead> ugh, i am not allowed on facebook
[18:04:03] <imsky> full of powertripping nerds
[18:04:07] <abjorn> that's the onready callback, vsmith
[18:04:12] <abjorn> it's called when the document is ready
[18:04:26] <coldhead> k abjorn, i'm gonna run all my links past you first and you can check imsky's facebook for novelty
[18:04:34] <vsmith> okay so i am getting an error on that
[18:04:39] <abjorn> like I have imsky on facebook
[18:04:40] <vsmith> but why
[18:05:10] <vsmith> should i change that?
[18:05:13] <abjorn> because jQuery can't be found. It looks like your plugins are just conflicting, vsmith
[18:05:19] <imsky> haha steve's just trolling metrowerks
[18:05:22] <abjorn> some plugins wanna use $ some don't
[18:05:31] <imsky> "with metrowerks, the first thing you have to do is move to xcode"
[18:05:31] <abjorn> If you can, make them all use jQuery instead of $
[18:05:46] <vsmith> abjorn how would i do that
[18:05:49] <vsmith> ?
[18:05:54] <abjorn> change the .js files for the plugins
[18:06:00] <abjorn> ctrl+h
[18:06:02] <abjorn> to replace
[18:06:37] <vsmith> what  does ctrl + h do?
[18:06:41] <imsky> abjorn: http://i.minus.com/ibfDJZ86sKKve4.png
[18:06:58] <kenthree> no offense but if that's a real site why are you in  charge of it?
[18:07:21] <vsmith> kenthree are you asking me
[18:07:31] <abjorn> well that's no way to think kenthree
[18:07:54] <abjorn> ctrl + h is a shortcut for find/replace in most text editors
[18:08:00] <vsmith> actually i built this site form the ground up.  allmy work and coding
[18:08:13] <vsmith> okay mine is cmd + f
[18:08:18] <imsky> must...resist
[18:08:25] <abjorn> well, okay, you get the idea
[18:08:39] <vsmith> okay thks

[18:10:20] <imsky> who the hell still distributes powerpc binaries
[18:10:31] <abjorn> good question
[18:11:00] <solidus-river> hey, is there no 'scroll' event to bind to using a live binder?
[18:11:43] <charnel> I am using jquery ui and one button in the dialog is disabled by default did anyone had the same problem before?
[18:12:07] <abjorn> brb gonna make food

[18:14:08] <bot-t> kenthree, cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[18:14:44] <kenthree> wonder how many times he had to rehears it
[18:15:19] <coldhead> enough not to impale himself
[18:15:27] <coldhead> the outtakes must be hilarious
[18:15:53] <charnel> removed almost all the code but still it disables the first button in the dialog
[18:19:14] <abjorn> psh
[18:19:15] <abjorn> whatever
[18:19:30] <abjorn> @imsky,coldhead
[18:19:36] <imsky> the mathematica powerpc->intel port took 2 hours from a cold start
[18:21:33] <solidus-river> this is wierd
[18:21:55] <solidus-river> $('selector').live('scroll', function); is not working
[18:22:00] <solidus-river> but
[18:22:03] <solidus-river> $('selector').scroll(function); is working
[18:22:04] <imsky> lol
[18:22:10] <solidus-river> is there a workaround for this, is this how it should be?
[18:22:13] <imsky> if only there was a reason for this
[18:22:33] <solidus-river> ^
[18:22:33] <chovy> solidus-river: try delegate
[18:22:39] <solidus-river> chovy?
[18:23:58] <Primer> Say I want to jsonp some XML..reading here that I'm supposed to use dataType: 'jsonp text xml'
[18:23:59] <solidus-river> i see
[18:24:16] <solidus-river> $.delegate('selector', 'scroll', function); then?
[18:24:39] <Primer> Thing is, that...doesn't work. I get an error in the console
[18:25:10] <Primer> Which I'm trying to reproduce, but my server's not cooperating at the moment
[18:25:59] <solidus-river> chovy: delegate doesn't seem to work either
[18:26:27] <solidus-river> i guess i could hack it together and make sure that the function is bound to the right element every time it happens to come into the page, but it would be nice if i could get .live to work
[18:32:54] <solidus-river> this is problematic
[18:33:09] <Primer> It seems that jquery don't automatically detect that I'm using https when doing $.ajax({dataType: 'xml'...
[18:33:28] <Primer> and use jsonp
[18:34:38] <Primer> dataType: 'jsonp text xml' <-- also fails, with a syntax error, as if it's trying to eval the XML
[18:44:17] <kenthree> why does find work here but not filter? $('<div><p>Text.</p></div>').find('p').text()
[18:46:58] <Eviltwin> kenthree: see ?.filter
[18:46:58] <bot-t> kenthree, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:49:12] <coldhead> filter is operating on the existing set of elements, find is choosing new elements from the descendents
[18:49:28] <coldhead> and your set is the containing <div>, not its children
[18:50:39] <imsky> how many questions can be answered by an api lookup in this chan?
[18:50:43] <imsky> like 80, 90%?
[18:50:55] <Primer> many, surely
[18:51:20] <Primer> But how about my question? $.ajax({dataType: 'jsonp xml'...  <-- syntax error in the console
[18:51:27] <Primer> when it clearly returns XML
[18:51:47] <Primer> having to use https from an http page on the same host
[18:54:53] <imsky> what
[18:59:08] <solidus-river> Primer: have you actuall checked what the ajax call is returning
[18:59:26] <Primer> I can't get that far, as it bombs in jquery
[18:59:46] <Primer> I was hoping to get more insight here before digging into jquery code
[19:01:03] <Primer> I basically need a jsonp call that doesn't "interpret" any of the output
[19:01:32] <solidus-river> Primer: just handle it yourself in the callback of success
[19:01:39] <solidus-river> probably safest if your running into issues
[19:01:43] <Primer> I just need the raw output, but it has to be jsonp, since it's effectively a different host
[19:02:01] <Primer> yeah, see, that presumes I ever get to the callback, which I do not...not sure how to make that plainer
[19:03:04] <Primer> $.ajax({dataType:'text'... causes origin problem
[19:03:21] <Primer> jquery is not smart enough to make that go through jsonp
[19:03:53] <solidus-river> Primer: sorry i dont really understand jasonp, if its just like json that cant you not specify xml and just get the "Text" as interpreted by jsonp?
[19:04:10] <Primer> $.ajax({dataType:'jsonp text'...Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[19:04:29] <Primer> solidus-river: If you knew what jsonp was, you would not be asking that
[19:04:37] <Primer> jsonp is when you have to cross domains
[19:04:42] <Primer> or http to https
[19:04:56] <Primer> XMLHttpRequest requires same origin
[19:05:10] <Primer> so the so called "script proxy", or jsonp, must be used
[19:05:39] <solidus-river> aye, it seems odd to me that they would make such a tool, they enforce origin signatures to match for security, for very good security resons
[19:05:51] <Primer> it's not a tool
[19:05:52] <Primer> it's a hack
[19:06:36] <Primer> <script src="path specified in the $.ajax call with some ?callback= added"> <-- that is appended to the head of the document
[19:06:38] <kolix> Hi guys, I'm new to jquery
[19:06:42] <Primer> It's an old trick
[19:06:50] <solidus-river> man, i know this is way off your topic but it doesn't seem like many people can help in here or are around but the web is hackish enough without crap like that
[19:06:57] <solidus-river> i would find another way
[19:07:02] <kolix> anyways, i have an input text with an id of id="test", how do i refrence this in jquery
[19:07:03] <Primer> There is no other way
[19:07:08] <kolix> $('test')?
[19:07:15] <Primer> $('#test')
[19:07:18] <Primer> # for id
[19:07:19] <kolix> thanks
[19:07:22] <solidus-river> you could make the origin a valide uri to the server your requesting it from
[19:07:23] <Eviltwin> kolix: jQuery uses CSS-style selectors
[19:07:34] <kolix> so all id's need to be prefixed with #?
[19:07:36] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[19:07:39] <Primer> solidus-river: still doesn't solve http vs. https
[19:07:49] <kolix> thanks guys
[19:07:58] <Eviltwin> kolix: If you want to look up by ID, you use the symbol for that, the # symbol
[19:08:18] <solidus-river> Primer: i haven't looked into the specifics but it seems as though securing an https connection through an http connection would be rather insecure
[19:08:40] <Primer> again, a necessary evil
[19:08:51] <Primer> Especially if you want to do lots of ajax stuff
[19:16:48] <Squarism> Jquery has this "param" mehtod that serialized json to a query string. Does anyone know how to parse these in a java servlet? Maybe jackson-json lib has something for that?
[19:17:26] <Primer> that's probably the worst hack you could possibly do
[19:17:45] <Primer> Why not just raw post it?
[19:18:13] <Primer> query strings have limitations that vary from browser to browser...wait til you hit that hard length limit in IE
[19:18:56] <frenocha> yay IE :)
[19:18:58] <Primer> sigh, I just figured out my problem...my server's not wrapping the output in a callback
[19:19:06] <Primer> which is why jsonp isn't working
[19:21:48] <Squarism> Primer, its crossdomain.. so post is forbidden
[19:22:30] <Primer> Squarism: ahh right
[19:22:42] <Primer> stupid browser limitations
[19:22:46] <Squarism> Primer, im doing jsonp too for that sake
[19:22:54] <Squarism> =/
[19:29:44] <Sazpaimon> I want to take a selector that may return multiple objects, and put all their IDs into an array, that I can join later on.
[19:29:55] <Sazpaimon> is there a way of doing this without something like .each?
[19:31:36] <Sazpaimon> guess I could do $.map
[19:32:02] <Primer> sigh, even wrapped in a callback, javascript hates it
[19:32:20] <Primer> something's still trying to interpret it
[19:32:20] <Sazpaimon> something like $.map($(".class"),function (e){ return e.id; });
[19:32:42] <Sazpaimon> should return an array of ids for all elements with class as their className
[19:34:08] <ajpiano> Sazpaimon: var ids = $(".class").map(function() { retutn this.id }).get();
[19:34:17] <ajpiano> there is a map on the jquery prototype
[19:35:00] <Sazpaimon> ajpiano, I thought map requires an array as a first argument
[19:35:11] <ajpiano> that's the utilty method $.map
[19:35:17] <ajpiano> you can also do map to a jquery collection
[19:35:29] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquerys map methods @ Sazpaimon
[19:35:30] <bot-t> Sazpaimon, When To Use jQuery's .map Methods - adam j. sontag - http://ajpiano.com/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[19:37:52] <Sazpaimon> ajpiano, what was the .get() part for
[19:38:03] <Sazpaimon> i know what .get does, just not sure what it's doing there
[19:38:13] <Eviltwin> ?.get @ Sazpaimon
[19:38:13] <bot-t> Sazpaimon, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[19:38:17] <frenocha> jquery sure makes me love server-side scripting sometimes :(
[19:38:23] <ajpiano> Sazpaimon: "When you use jQuery.fn.map, the result is a jQuery object - an array of values with a set of functions made available by jQuery. Usually the array contains DOM nodes, but after using $.fn.map, itâ€™s just an array of arbitrary values. Most people are familiar with using .get(index) to access the DOM node at a selected index, but when .get() is called with no arguments, it returns the entire underlying array."
[19:38:28] <frenocha> why do browsers insist on doing things differently? *end of short rant*
[19:38:57] <imsky> abjorn: lata pimp
[19:39:03] <Sazpaimon> oh I was confusing it with JQuery.get
[19:39:04] <Sazpaimon> my mistake
[19:39:06] <abjorn> lata ho
[19:39:07] <Eviltwin> frenocha: It's mostly IE's dickishness vs. people with standards
[19:39:32] <Eviltwin> frenocha: jQuery does help mend a lot of the seams though
[19:39:40] <frenocha> Eviltwin: it's Opera vs. Firefox for me at the moment :( I have given up on even trying to support IE on the non-public websites I make these days
[19:40:04] <frenocha> jQuery does make life easier :)
[19:40:08] <Eviltwin> Well why don't you describe the inconsistency here
[19:40:12] <Eviltwin> And we'll see if we can help
[19:40:26] <frenocha> no, that's ok. I enjoy a good hunt ;)
[19:40:32] <frenocha> i'll be sure to ask as soon as i'm really, really stuck
[19:43:16] <Eviltwin> frenocha: We'll be sure to be unavailable then :P
[19:43:26] <frenocha> Eviltwin: I'd expect nothing less! :P
[19:45:55] <frenocha> ever since i've been testing all my pages on mobile browsers, my life has been hell :o
[19:46:35] <oojacoboo> do most people use the validate plugin or roll their own validation?
[19:47:25] <oojacoboo> I've never used the validate plugin, but I'd think it'd be limited in it's approach
[19:47:56] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: What kind of validation are you trying to do?
[19:48:05] <frenocha> oojacoboo: form validation?
[19:48:18] <oojacoboo> well, this is more of a generic question, yea, form validation
[19:48:21] <abjorn> (ã¥ï½¡â—•â€¿â€¿â—•ï½¡)ã¥
[19:48:24] <frenocha> if so, I always run my own... but that's mostly because i'm very stubborn
[19:49:01] <oojacoboo> yea, we've always done the same to date, but it leaves you with bloated js files
[19:49:45] <oojacoboo> but of course, you have more control over the situation, being able to tie in other js cues and such based on the validation error
[19:49:55] <frenocha> indeed
[19:50:08] <frenocha> as long as the form is validated properly and bandwidth is not the most pressing concern, either method ought to suffice
[19:50:18] <vsmith> hey guys i am trying to figure out hoe to get rid of this jquery plugin error
[19:50:22] <vsmith> still
[19:50:28] <vsmith> the error is:  jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[19:50:46] <vsmith> this is the site http://shafteldms.diamondbuyers.com/
[19:50:48] <oojacoboo> frenocha: yea
[19:51:27] <oojacoboo> frenocha: do you use a singleton, or one offs?
[19:51:44] <vsmith> can any one help?
[19:52:10] <bloopletech> hmm, is there a way to see if my browser xhr connections are being filled up?
[19:52:15] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ vsmith
[19:52:16] <bot-t> vsmith, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[19:52:38] <frenocha> I like singletons
[19:53:01] <vsmith> okay,
[19:53:03] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:55:48] <shlevy> If I use $('embed').load() to define a handler for when my embedded svg is fully loaded, do I risk a race condition where my handler is never called because the svg was already loaded?
[19:57:20] <frenocha> oojacoboo: i'm actually going to play around a little with that jquery validator now - you've inspired me! ;)
[19:57:31] <oojacoboo> ha
[20:01:02] <Spadeski> Hey can someone make this simple move from left too right http://jsfiddle.net/ACenH/7/
[20:07:56] <maden> can anyone explain to me why the class selector on class dateFoo does not trigger anything on click here? http://tinypaste.com/9999e1ee
[20:09:08] <Eviltwin> What version of jQuery?
[20:09:48] <maden> 1.8.16
[20:10:30] <Eviltwin> jQuery not jQuery UI
[20:10:37] <Spadeski> Hey can someone make this simple move from left too right http://jsfiddle.net/ACenH/7/
[20:10:38] <maden> sorry, 1.6.2
[20:10:41] <Squarism> Jquery has this "param" mehtod that serialized json to a query string. Does anyone know how to parse these in a java servlet? Maybe jackson-json lib has something for that?
[20:10:53] <Squarism> sorry for repost.. but im very eager to find such a lib
[20:11:03] <Eviltwin> maden: Does .dateFoo exist when the page loads or do you create it?
[20:11:31] <maden> it does not, it is created in the datepicker element
[20:11:56] <maden> the 2nd parameter of the return statement is the class to be added to the day
[20:12:03] <maden> and so dateFoo should be created
[20:12:31] <maden> if I 'manually' create an onclick event by using a for look on every dateFoo classes, then it does trigger the jQuery trigger
[20:12:44] <Eviltwin> Okay, can you try $(document).delegate(".dateFoo","click",function(){...}) instead of $(".dateFoo").click(function(){...})
[20:14:40] <maden> Eviltwin: that worked, but would you mind explaining why?
[20:14:49] <maden> actually, ill look up the function myself, thanks!
[20:16:45] <Eviltwin> maden: Most events bubble
[20:17:03] <maden> im not sure I understand what you mean by bubble...
[20:17:04] <Eviltwin> Meaning if you click the <a> tag inside <div><span><a>click me</a></span></div>
[20:17:12] <Eviltwin> The event listeners for <a> are triggered
[20:17:16] <Eviltwin> Then the event listeners for <span>
[20:17:24] <Eviltwin> Then the event listeners for <div>
[20:17:26] <maden> ahh very well
[20:17:28] <Eviltwin> Up to <body> and <html>
[20:17:32] <Eviltwin> And document
[20:17:41] <Eviltwin> So what the delegate is doing is binding to the document
[20:17:52] <Eviltwin> And then checking if what you clicked matches ".dateFoo"
[20:18:55] <Eviltwin> It might be wasteful if there are lot of clicks that aren't on .dateFoo
[20:19:10] <Eviltwin> It'll keep checking unnecessarily to see if they were
[20:19:24] <Eviltwin> But that's only a concern on huge sites where you might click thousands of times
[20:19:56] <durin> has anyone ever had a problem with colorbox where an iframe doesn't fill the wrapper?
[20:22:25] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Eviltwin, I know you said earlier that the api docs for .on were clear about mapping multiple bindings with selectors, but I didn't find anything of the sort. I found multiple bindings (which I knew from reading the API), but I didn't see how to a) pass data or b) pass selector filters when mapping multiple events using .on
[20:23:01] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Really? It's right there: .on( events-map [, selector] [, data] )
[20:23:33] <Whirl3d> But that only works if you are binding multiple events to a single selector..which I already knew
[20:23:59] <Eviltwin> Well that's what .bind, .delegate, and .live have always done
[20:24:15] <Eviltwin> If you're looking to bind a bunch of different events to a bunch of different selectors with a bunch of different data
[20:24:22] <Eviltwin> You're looking at separate calls to .on
[20:24:45] <Eviltwin> You have to admit, that's be pretty overloaded functionality right there
[20:25:10] <Whirl3d> Sure, but it's not the first time that you would see that either in a plugin or in jquery...
[20:25:17] <Whirl3d> But that's why I asked
[20:26:01] <Eviltwin> If you want to store a mapping like [ { "events": { "click": function(){...}, "focus": function(){...} }, "selector": ".foo", "data": {"bar": "zed"} }, ... ]
[20:26:07] <Eviltwin> You can go right ahead
[20:26:32] <Eviltwin> And do $.each([...],function() { $(document).on(this.events,this.selector,this.data) })
[20:26:46] <Whirl3d> Right now, I am using .on on a form element and checking e.target for "click" "keypress", etc.
[20:27:51] <Whirl3d> When I saw you suggest that it was better to use the selector, I took your advice to heart and re-evaluated my code
[20:28:52] <Eviltwin> Well hold on
[20:29:05] <Whirl3d> I'm doing a simple contact form, so I probably don't need to do any of this, but I was just hoping to learn in the process
[20:29:16] <Eviltwin> There's a reason that the bind-style syntax still exists
[20:29:24] <Eviltwin> There's a right time to use it
[20:29:54] <Whirl3d> That's where the API docs aren't able to hold a candle to the real live experience of experts like yourself.
[20:30:07] <Eviltwin> If you are targeting up to three specific elements, the .bind style is still generally more efficient
[20:30:19] <Eviltwin> In your case it sounds like you have one form
[20:30:33] <Whirl3d> and a simple form at that.
[20:30:42] <Eviltwin> If that's the case and that form isn't dynamically loaded and stuff
[20:30:47] <Eviltwin> Just bind to it directly
[20:31:27] <Eviltwin> The reason it's faster in this case is that the delegate-style syntax requires that for each event of that type, it checks to see if the event target matches the selector
[20:31:41] <Eviltwin> Which while it isn't as slow as checking the whole document for elements that match the selector
[20:31:45] <Eviltwin> It's still non-zero time
[20:31:55] <Eviltwin> Where as the direct bind doesn't do any sort of checking like that
[20:32:09] <Eviltwin> The browser already takes care of making sure you only get the events you're supposed to
[20:33:01] <Whirl3d> Gotcha. That makes a lot more sense. I thought I was going to benefit by having the one handler function, but it makes more sense (since I only have a handful of fields) to bind to the fields themselves....right? or am I still not getting it?
[20:33:04] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:33:08] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to Event performance
[20:33:31] <Eviltwin> It breifly explains when to use some of the syntaxes
[20:33:32] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I read that...several times. I have it open right now, in fact.
[20:33:49] <Eviltwin> "Attaching many delegated event handlers near the top of the document tree can degrade performance."
[20:34:54] <Whirl3d> I was attaching them to the form element, that's why I figured that line didin't apply to me.
[20:35:57] <Eviltwin> And what you're doing is fine which is why I brought in the other statistic
[20:36:02] <Eviltwin> The rule about 3 elements
[20:37:08] <Eviltwin> The delegate-style is useful for two reasons 1) It allows the listener to effectively be attached to new, future elements that match the selector 2) It allows us to attach only one listener instead of potentially hundreds of elements
[20:37:42] <Eviltwin> In the first case, it doesn't matter if it's one element or not, if you can't control when the elements enter the DOM, you unfortunately need to use delegate either way
[20:37:54] <Eviltwin> In the second case, it's a question of performance not "live"-ness
[20:38:35] <Eviltwin> And from the benchmarks I've seen, it's generally >3 elements where .delegate becomes faster
[20:38:48] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I gotta go
[20:38:52] <Eviltwin> But I hope this gelps
[20:38:53] <Eviltwin> helps*
[20:39:07] <Eviltwin> G'night
[20:39:14] <Whirl3d> so, in my form, I have a button that allows you to add another "contact" section to the form. I ifigured that using .on would remove the need to bind events to the newly added "contact"section. But since I am generating the new section anyways, it would be just as easy to bind to it's elements during the constructor.
[20:39:27] <Whirl3d> As always, Eviltwin, you have been a great help. Thanks again.
[20:52:31] <solidus-river> is there a way to purge any sort of binds placed on a dom element?
[20:52:41] <solidus-river> something is really screwing with this dom elementin my page and i have no idea what it is
[20:52:55] <solidus-river> but i want it to go away, and i cant find anyplace in my code where i bind any sort of call back to this element
[20:53:23] <Whirl3d> what kind of element is it?
[20:55:24] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: its a ul with overflow: auto and a max-height of 500 that i populate and then slideDown()
[20:55:33] <solidus-river> after it is shown i cant scroll down from the top with the mouse wheel
[20:55:38] <solidus-river> i have to click the scroll bar then pull it down
[20:55:41] <solidus-river> or it jumps back to the top
[20:57:10] <solidus-river> I also cant seem to bind events to the element or anything
[20:57:24] <oojacoboo> what's the best way to validate a select?
[20:57:57] <oojacoboo> if($("#foo").val() === "") {} ?
[20:58:56] <SamuraiDio> do someone knows a good number field plugin to jquery? like Ext.Form.NumberField does?
[21:01:00] <Whirl3d> solidus-river, are you using the mousewheel plugin?
[21:01:54] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: no, i dont think i am
[21:02:00] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: should i be?
[21:02:57] <Whirl3d> Honestly, I am not sure and I am probably not the best to tell you one way or the other. I just noticed a bug report for the mousewheel plugin and thought maybe your issue was related...
[21:04:23] <sasori> the duration param in jquery's hide() and the like, what unit of time measurement is being used in that ?
[21:04:42] <mansoor> sasori: milliseconds
[21:04:46] <mansoor> 1000 = 1 second
[21:05:07] <sasori> if am gonna put just "1" ,, what's this ?
[21:05:16] <mansoor> thats 1 millisecond
[21:05:24] <sasori> mansoor: ok thanks :)
[21:06:30] <solidus-river> sigh
[21:08:23] <Whirl3d> solidus-river, I don't know about scrolling with ul elements. I always wrap the ul in a div and set the scrolling/sliding on it. Don't know if that would help or not, but it's worth a try/
[21:12:46] <solidus-river> Whirl3d yeah I'll try that for now though i just want to get a buggy version out so my bosses know i was doing SOMETHING with my time today
[21:12:51] <solidus-river> its honestly been 6 hours of jquery issues
[21:12:59] <solidus-river> jquery is AMAZING when it works
[21:13:03] <solidus-river> and when it doesn't ...
[21:13:32] <solidus-river> good luck with the function wrapper after function wrapper after function wrapper after lambda after ..... (welcome to debugger hell)
[21:13:56] <Whirl3d> I share your frustration. Unfortunately, I find that 99.9% of the time, it's me that's broken--not jquery.
[21:14:43] <solidus-river> yeah i dont doubt it, i just wich i new what, i mean, i cant set the scrollTop function of these ul's, i cant scroll them with the mouse wheel, I can't bind things to them via live
[21:14:46] <solidus-river> like nothing works on them
[21:15:12] <Whirl3d> Hey. I have an idea.
[21:15:21] <Whirl3d> try using .on instead of .live
[21:15:53] <oojacoboo> .on is only with 1.7
[21:15:55] <oojacoboo> IIRc
[21:16:11] <Whirl3d> yes...
[21:16:28] <oojacoboo> live is for THAT element witout a DOM change
[21:16:28] <oojacoboo> if th
[21:16:28] <oojacoboo> e
[21:16:29] <oojacoboo> d
[21:16:43] <oojacoboo> if the DOM changes, you need to delegate to a parent element that stays in the dom
[21:16:49] <oojacoboo> .delegate()
[21:18:00] <solidus-river> i'm using 1.7.1
[21:18:15] <oojacoboo> go for it, use .on() then
[21:18:33] <solidus-river> oojacoboo: explain what that means, what i thought .live did was bind the function to the trigger on the matched elements, and then applied that to any newly introduced elements into the dom?
[21:18:41] <oojacoboo> that doesnt' change the fact that you'll need to bind it to a parent element if that element doesnt' stay in the DOM
[21:18:57] <oojacoboo> solidus-river: no
[21:19:20] <oojacoboo> .live() binds to THAT element, if it leaves the DOM, there aren't any listeners b/c there isnt' anything bound
[21:19:33] <oojacoboo> you need to bind to a parent element that stays in the DOM
[21:20:31] <solidus-river> oojacoboo: this sounds like the issue i'm running into then
[21:20:45] <solidus-river> oojacoboo: i remove the element i have bound with live, and replace it with another element of the same type
[21:20:56] <solidus-river> oojacoboo: so how would i assure that this new element gets bound, i'm confused by .on
[21:21:11] <solidus-river> so should i bind .on to the root of the dom and select my type of element with the selector?
[21:21:13] <oojacoboo> solidus-river: use .delegate()
[21:21:21] <oojacoboo> check the docs for the syntax
[21:21:28] <oojacoboo> choose a parent element that stays in the DOM
[21:22:19] <solidus-river> sweet, well theres one frustration taken care of
[21:22:22] <solidus-river> :)
[21:27:20] <solidus-river> oojacoboo: damn, delegate doesnt appear to be working either
[21:27:33] <oojacoboo> solidus-river: testcase this
[21:29:01] <solidus-river> gah, it so freakin complicated though, it woudl take forever to test case, i have a ul.posts with li.post, the li.post has div.comments_list which has ul.comments... what i did was $('li.post').delegate('ul.comments', 'scroll', function);
[21:29:49] <oojacoboo> mmm
[21:30:11] <oojacoboo> solidus-river: I think that's backwards
[21:30:36] <Whirl3d> ul.comments.on('scroll','li.post', function (e) {do something here})
[21:30:44] <oojacoboo> $("bindingElement").delegate("liveElement", ...
[21:31:22] <Whirl3d> *remove the li.post
[21:31:48] <Whirl3d> $("ul.comments").on('scroll', function (e) { handlescrolling});
[21:32:36] <Whirl3d> wait, which ul scrolls?
[21:32:49] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: ul.comments
[21:33:00] <Whirl3d> but that is being removed?
[21:33:12] <oojacoboo> solidus-river: just do what I pasted
[21:33:13] <solidus-river> Whirl3d, aye, it gets removed and readded
[21:34:04] <Whirl3d> so then try $("ul.post").on("scroll", function (e) { var scrollingUL=$(e.target); do whatever});
[21:36:33] <solidus-river> $('li.post').on('scroll', 'ul.comments', $.throttle( 250, comment_scroll_event));
[21:36:57] <solidus-river> oh so i shouldn't put the filter in that, but the ul.post doesn't scroll
[21:37:04] * solidus-river scratches head
[21:38:50] <Cork> solidus-river: i don't think , $.throttle( 250, comment_scroll_event)) is what you want to do
[21:39:04] <Cork> unless $.throttle returns a function that is the event handler
[21:39:35] <solidus-river> Cork: it does but i'll take it out of the equation for now
[21:39:59] <Whirl3d> solidus-river, can you bind the scroll event to the newly added ul.comments when you add them?
[21:40:33] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: haha, yeah i guess thats the easy answer in this case, i though instead of trying to handle every case where i add a new ul.comments from the backend i would get a catchall with delegate or live
[21:40:36] <solidus-river> but maybe thats the way to go
[21:40:45] <solidus-river> when i do .scroll(blah) it just works
[21:42:18] <Whirl3d> it looks like the scroll event doesn't bubble, but the mousewheel event does.
[21:42:53] <solidus-river> no other piece of my code is handling mousewheel events
[21:43:12] <solidus-river> oh, but your saying maybe the bubling of the mousewheel event is causing something else to get called?
[21:47:59] <Whirl3d> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4331
[21:49:17] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: LOL that explains that
[21:49:27] <Whirl3d> is it possible that you have to apply focus to the scrolling element?
[21:49:59] <Whirl3d> perhaps if you don't have it focused, the scroll event that the mousewheel attempts doesn't know which element to scroll?
[21:50:29] <Whirl3d> Maybe try $("ul.comments").focus()....it's a longshot, but maybe
[21:50:32] <solidus-river> hmm, but the element does itself scroll, it just "pops" back to the top, I'll try this though, this could be as i focus on an element outside of the ul via jquery
[21:51:25] <solidus-river> hmm, somethings making it jump to the top and its not clear what exactly, i wish i could link you guys the page
[21:57:58] <solidus-river> hmm, i got it down to that for some reason scrollTop does not work when the element is fresh into the domTree with overflow: auto
[22:05:23] <yo> http://jsfiddle.net/7rFdQ/ : First time using jQuery validation, any idea why this isn't working?
[22:07:21] <rocketman> Can anyone tell me why this page doesnt work? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14080718/Final/TabsInTabs.html
[22:07:57] <rocketman> I Its basically a nested tab layout
[22:08:27] <Cork> rocketman: never ask a question with "why this doesn't work"
[22:08:36] <Cork> explain what happens and what should happen
[22:08:43] <Cork> so ppl don't have to guess
[22:09:10] <rocketman> My subnav doesnt seem to work.
[22:09:16] <rocketman> Sorry, you are right.
[22:10:01] <yo> trying to validate a simple form, send ajax request if it's valid
[22:10:25] <yo> linked the appropriate script files, but didn't include them in fiddle
[22:10:28] <rocketman> I did that. and it seemed to validate right
[22:10:42] <yo> I'm using asp mvc if that matters.
[22:10:49] <rocketman> its like something is caneling my nested tabs out
[22:14:30] <varnie> helo
[22:14:37] <Cork> rocketman: try moving the one two and three elements out into content
[22:14:52] <varnie> why does the following show false? "jQuery.data(jQuery(".qwe"), "lock", 1);
[22:14:52] <varnie> console.log( jQuery.hasData(jQuery(".qwe")) );"
[22:14:53] <Cork> that is make them siblings to work, not children
[22:15:20] <rocketman> Oh ok , Ill give it a try
[22:16:09] <solidus-river> Whirl3d: <3 i got the logic working now :)
[22:17:34] <varnie> but "console.log(jQuery(".qwe").data('lock'));" returns true
[22:20:16] <dnsdds> Since I couldn't figure out a pure CSS way, is there a jQuery way of imitating behavior that the top attribute would be position: fixed; and the right attribute would be position: absolute; (relative to a parent element with position: relative;)?
[22:24:32] <jehoshua02> How would I use JQuery .wrap() to wrap this in a div with a class? --> $(data).find('#content').contents()
[22:27:11] <jehoshua02> Or a better question, what's the cleanest way to wrap my stuff ($(data).find('#content').contents()) in a div?
[22:35:22] <jbooker> Morning all, can anyone help me with delegated events - http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/7/
[22:36:44] <coldhead> jbooker: this.parent.load(this.href); probably should be $(this).parent.load(this.href);
[22:36:51] <coldhead> er
[22:37:03] <coldhead> $(this).parent().load(this.href);
[22:37:10] <dr0id> and you added preventDefault before it :/
[22:38:29] <jbooker> coldhead: would you mind explaining why
[22:38:39] <jbooker> coldhead: i'd like to learn why rather than fix and forget
[22:38:41] <coldhead> this is just the DOM element
[22:38:54] <coldhead> $(this) is the dom element with jQuery super powers
[22:39:03] <jbooker> ah, because i need the dom node to 'get at' the parent, not just the object
[22:39:05] <coldhead> .load() is a jquery superpower
[22:39:15] <coldhead> right
[22:39:17] <jbooker> will test brb
[22:39:21] <coldhead> good luck
[22:39:51] <coldhead> works for me
[22:39:53] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:39:54] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:40:10] <dr0id> ?next
[22:40:10] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[22:40:14] <dr0id> :P
[22:40:58] <jbooker> coldhead: - perfect. next question, how do i get at a parent with a certain class? as in, not the immediate parent (since an A tag could be in a div, or in a table etc)
[22:41:12] <coldhead> ?closest @ jbooker
[22:41:12] <bot-t> jbooker, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[22:41:35] <jbooker> coldhead: you're a star, thankyou
[22:41:42] <coldhead> my pleasure
[22:41:49] <jehoshua02> How would I wrap this junk -- $(data).find('#content').contents() -- in a div?
[22:41:59] <jbooker> so .closest('.ui-tabs-pabel') will find me the div with that class, regardless of how many levels up it has to go
[22:42:09] <coldhead> right on, jbooker
[22:42:18] <jbooker> coldhead: thanks for the assist
[22:43:54] <solidus-river> how do i get the height of the content within a scroll area and not the height of the scroll area?
[22:44:01] <Cork> jehoshua02: var content = $(data).find('#content'); content.html($('<div/>').html(content.contents()));
[22:44:29] <Cork> solidus-river: you often need to add an extra wrapping element to do that
[22:45:17] <Cork> solidus-river: you could try with scrollHeight, but it doesn't always give you what you want
[22:46:00] <solidus-river> cork: scrollHeight?
[22:46:06] <Cork> yes
[22:46:09] <solidus-river> Cork: doesnt seem to exist
[22:46:26] <solidus-river> is it a jquery function or an attribute?
[22:46:29] <Cork> $('#scroller')[0].scrollHeight
[22:48:23] <solidus-river> Cork: it appears scrollHeight + height = scrollTop
[22:48:42] <solidus-river> i mean for the bottom of the list that is
[22:48:43] <Cork> uh... no
[22:49:02] <Cork> scrollTop is how many px from the top the scrollbar has been moved
[22:49:09] <Cork> height is the height of the viewport
[22:49:33] <solidus-river> it seems scrollHeight is the amount over the viewport the scrollable area is
[22:49:44] <Cork> ya
[22:50:21] <Cork> scrollHeight is as it says how many px the scrollbar can go
[22:50:36] <Cork> so scrollHeight + height should be the entire height of the content
[22:50:40] <jehoshua02> Cork: Thanks. It worked. I tweaked it like so to make it one line: var content = $('<div class="someclass"/>').html($(data).find('#content').contents());
[22:50:51] <jehoshua02> Thanks again.
[22:51:16] <Cork> jehoshua02: you could try with .wrap too
[22:51:18] <jbooker> ack just found my huge mistake - how do i change the selector '.tabcontainer a' to match ANY a within .tabcontainer, at any level?
[22:51:22] <Cork> but not sure if it works with .contents
[22:51:54] <jehoshua02> Cork: I wasn't figuring out the syntax for .wrap.
[22:52:28] <jehoshua02> Besides, I think it would wrap the #content element, rather than discarding it and wrapping it's contents.
[22:52:31] <Cork> its just $('selector').wrap('html used to wrapp the selectorsÃ¤)
[22:52:31] <jehoshua02> Meh.
[22:52:33] <Whirl3d> $('.tabcontainer').find("a")?
[22:52:58] <Cork> *selectors')
[22:53:02] <jehoshua02> Cork: I tried it but it ended up wrapping each item within.
[22:53:08] <Cork> exactly
[22:53:19] <Cork> thats why i said "but not sure if it works with .contents"
[22:53:45] <Cork> cause i suspect it fraps each child of the content with its own wrapper
[22:54:08] <jbooker> oh god it already does. I can't work out why my example on jsfiddle.net works, but my real code doesn't
[22:54:09] <jehoshua02> Cork: exactly.
[22:54:41] <Cork> fraps==wraps XD
[22:55:37] <jehoshua02> $($(data).find('#content').contents()).wrap($('<div class="product-popup"/>'));
[22:55:56] <jehoshua02> I end up with half a dozen wrappers.
[22:56:01] <jehoshua02> It's okay.
[22:56:03] <Cork> the extra $() won't change anything
[22:56:10] <coldhead> DOWN WITH STONKY
[22:56:39] <Cork> jehoshua02: $(data).find('#content').contents().wrap($('<div class="product-popup"/>')); should do the exact same thing
[22:56:55] <jehoshua02> Yes.
[22:57:18] <jehoshua02> Even the $() around the wrapper is excess.
[22:57:22] <Whirl3d> twonky or stonky?
[22:57:36] <coldhead> STONKY, DOWN WITH STONKY
[22:57:51] <Whirl3d> pfew, cause twonky rocks...
[22:57:59] <varnie> is it possible to put event handler on html selector?
[22:58:07] <varnie> sorry, on the click event
[22:58:23] <jbooker> ack. can anyone help me with delegated events?
[22:58:35] <Cork> varnie: html selector??
[22:58:59] <Cork> jbooker: didn't coldhead already do that?
[22:59:34] <varnie> on "<select> item
[22:59:46] <coldhead> i certainly felt like i had, Cork
[22:59:51] <varnie> <select><option ..><option ..></select>
[22:59:52] <jbooker> Cork: he helped me with my selector, but my basic problem still remains, after a load() event, the delegated events don't propogate back down to the new contents of the div, which is precisely why i am using delegated events in the first place
[22:59:55] <coldhead> it seemed like real progress
[23:00:02] <coldhead> and this is a devestating set back
[23:00:17] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[23:00:18] <Cork> varnie: if you mean you have html and want to bind a selector just run it through $()
[23:00:24] <coldhead> i thought i had come so far
[23:00:24] <jbooker> coldhead: it was, and i appreciate it, it fixed my selector and got my initial requests working again
[23:00:34] <coldhead> and now this
[23:00:37] <varnie> I want to forbid changing its current selected item
[23:00:40] <jbooker> ...
[23:00:44] <coldhead> "lucky i didn't tell him about the dirty fork"
[23:00:45] <Cork> jbooker: he's just joking, he liks doing that :)
[23:00:55] <jbooker> ok
[23:01:05] <coldhead> sorry, i thought i was muted
[23:01:12] <coldhead> it's my first day using irc
[23:01:12] <jbooker> but after a .load() the event listeners don't propogate down again
[23:01:14] <jbooker> any ideas?
[23:01:20] <jbooker> coldhead: first day using a computer?
[23:01:37] <coldhead> it feels like it
[23:01:39] <jbooker> coldhead: those things on the end of your arms are hands. the little wriggly things are finger.
[23:01:50] <coldhead> venerablis inceptor and all that
[23:02:11] <Cork> varnie: as i said just do var $select = $('<select><option ..><option ..></select>').bind('the event you want to bind, function()...);
[23:03:04] <jbooker> ok coldhead so this is where i am http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/11 - although jsfiddle's echo requests don't work. that code is equivalent to what i have on my dev machine, although the .tabcontainer div and all sub-divs are created automatically by the ui-tabs plugin
[23:03:39] <jbooker> coldhead: when the .load() request finishes (which works on my dev machine) the .on("click" doesn't get re-propagated down to the new <a> tags in the new content
[23:04:28] <Cork> jbooker: you prob need to use live events, not directly binded
[23:04:54] <jbooker> Cork - but i docs say that .live() has been deprecated and i should use .on()
[23:05:01] <jbooker> *but the
[23:05:13] <Cork> jbooker: i meant .on('event', 'selector'
[23:05:23] <Cork> jbooker: that is still a live event :)
[23:05:44] <varnie> Cork, I think that <select> doesn't support click event, or maybe I missed something.
[23:06:28] <Cork> varnie: it does
[23:06:32] <jbooker> Cork: well that's what I am using - see http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/11/
[23:06:33] <Cork> + support it
[23:06:58] <jbooker> Cork: someone in here yesterday was trying to do .click() on a select and we couldn't get it to work on jsfiddle
[23:07:39] <Cork> uh...
[23:07:39] <varnie> the following code doesn't work for me: " jQuery("#field_country").bind('click', function(){ alert("test"); });"
[23:08:05] <varnie> but "change" does work, but I don't need it
[23:08:12] <dr0id> suggest me a good jquery file upload plugin
[23:08:42] <Cork> wfm http://jsfiddle.net/f5u5B/
[23:09:16] <Cork> jbooker: ^
[23:09:19] <jbooker> Cork: ah, i was talking about triggering a click (from another button) not reacting to one
[23:09:44] <Cork> ah, no you can't normally fake user actions
[23:09:58] <Cork> you can trigger your own click handels, but not default actions
[23:10:00] <jbooker> coldhead: Cork: can either of you suggest why the live events don't propogate? is there any way i can force it to, like do a .rescan() or something?
[23:10:20] <Xotix> jbooker you could trigger submit e.g.
[23:10:24] <Cork> jbooker: the code you showed me worked just fine
[23:10:50] <jbooker> Cork: what happened when you clicked the link? did it just disappear?
[23:11:10] <jbooker> Xotix: explain please?
[23:11:17] <Cork> it replaced the content in ui-tabs-panel
[23:11:18] <coldhead> jbooker: my guess is your new content doesn't have .ui-tabs-panel, which you're asking for with $(".tabcontainer").on("click", ".ui-tabs-panel a"
[23:11:24] <jbooker> Cork: with what?
[23:11:24] <Cork> as expected
[23:11:37] <jbooker> because on my screen the content just disappeared
[23:11:38] <Cork> nothing
[23:11:42] <coldhead> see if it works with $(".tabcontainer").on("click", "a"
[23:11:48] <Cork> jbooker: your loading an empty html file so...
[23:11:51] <jbooker> Cork - ok that's because jsfiddle's echos aren't working
[23:11:54] <coldhead> and failign that, do whatever Cork says because he's a smart cookie
[23:11:54] <jbooker> Cork oh i see
[23:12:08] <varnie> Cork, thank you
[23:12:11] <Cork> jbooker: it is working, your just not sending it anything
[23:12:31] <jbooker> Cork: ok, well in my dev code on the other machine, it is working, loading the content into the div fine
[23:12:49] <jbooker> Cork: but then in the NEW content which replaced the old, the <a> tags don't get the handler attached again
[23:12:54] <jbooker> coldhead: tring, afk
[23:14:50] <jbooker> coldhead: no difference, i'm afraid chainging it from $(".tabcontainer").on("click", ".ui-tabs-panel a" to $(".tabcontainer").on("click","a"  made no difference
[23:14:52] <Cork> jbooker: the handler is never attached
[23:15:00] <jbooker> Cork: i KNOW! :D
[23:15:03] <Spadeski> Hey Cork sau I had a div and wanted to scroll it left on a hyperlink click and show this other div of content slide in how would I go about that ?
[23:15:08] <Spadeski> say
[23:15:16] <Cork> jbooker: and for me it works just fine
[23:15:18] <jbooker> thats what i am trying to say - i thought the .on() automatically attached handlers to any new content
[23:15:30] <Cork> jbooker: else it would reload the entire page
[23:15:34] <jbooker> Cork - on the FIRST request.
[23:15:40] <jbooker> it reloads the div as expected.
[23:15:50] <Cork> *replaces
[23:15:50] <jbooker> but the div is blank, so you can't see the next but
[23:16:25] <__machine> i am experiencing very slow performance under IE7 and IE8 when i use livequery to add .first-child, .last-child etc classes to elements by their psuedo css classes in js, since ie7 and ie8 dont support these natively... on pages with a lot of data...
[23:16:46] <jbooker> Cork: but after the div's contents are replaced, then links in that new content don't get a handler attached, so clicking on any of THEM makes the whole page reload
[23:17:06] <Cork> jbooker: do you have somewhere you can show this?
[23:17:10] <jbooker> Cork - so why doesn;t the .on() react to the new divs
[23:17:10] <__machine> is this just a really bad idea, and i should dump the idea of using livequery and jquery to get enable compatibility with these psuedo classes? is there any alternative i can try?
[23:17:11] <Cork> i can't reproduce it here
[23:17:22] <jbooker> Cork: erm
[23:17:36] <jbooker> Cork: i don't know, not without a lot of messing about
[23:18:02] <jbooker> setting up hosting etc. problem is i am at work and my dev machine is on an isolated network
[23:19:16] <jbooker> Cork: I can put it on google sites, bear with me
[23:19:55] <coldhead> he's a patient soul, have no fear
[23:20:12] <coldhead> i've never once seen Cork kick someone for insolence or stupidity or timewasting
[23:20:48] <__machine> could i use live() or delegate() instead of livequery() to do the same thing? what event would i attach it to, that would only fire once for each matching element when the page is first loaded and for any new elements that are dynamically added to the dom?
[23:21:16] <ColKurtz> __machine: use delegate() or on()
[23:21:49] <__machine> ColKurtz: but which event(s) do i use with delegate?
[23:21:56] <ColKurtz> any
[23:22:02] <Spadeski> is there a way to slow down the html() maybe set a duration time ?
[23:22:07] <ColKurtz> your own custom event, a normal event like click or submit or hover
[23:22:23] <ColKurtz> Spadeski: setTimeout
[23:22:28] <Spadeski> Thank you
[23:22:47] <__machine> ColKurtz: my existing livequery method looks like this... http://pastebin.com/007WT4rc
[23:22:49] <ColKurtz> jquery delay() will delay animation queues, but not something like html()
[23:22:50] <Cork> jbooker: http://jsfiddle.net/DXEqZ/13/
[23:22:51] <__machine> it has no event
[23:23:08] <Cork> jbooker: that one works for me, and the loaded html works too
[23:23:09] <ColKurtz> wa wa wee wa what a selector
[23:23:20] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewhere __machine
[23:23:26] <coldhead> the existing livequery version
[23:23:37] <__machine> coldhead: i just did http://pastebin.com/007WT4rc
[23:24:37] <Spadeski> See any problems with $('.blue_handle').click(function(){setTimeout( function() {$(this).find('span').html('slow').fadeIn(900);}); });
[23:24:48] <Spadeski> at end
[23:24:49] <Cork> ya
[23:24:55] <__machine> should i use .one() instead? but still im not sure if there is a 'ready' event for individual elements?
[23:25:04] <Cork> $(this) in the timer won't point to the object you expect
[23:25:09] <Cork> Spadeski: ^
[23:25:12] <Spadeski> mm
[23:25:14] <Spadeski> your right
[23:25:19] <Spadeski> ty again
[23:25:43] <jbooker> Cork: i can see that, but i just don't get why it works there and not on my dev machine.
[23:25:52] <coldhead> you're*
[23:26:11] <Cork> jbooker: check so your not binding the listner on an element your replacing
[23:26:22] <Cork> jbooker: thats the only explenation i can find
[23:26:37] <Cork> jbooker: you should know that .on is not the same as .live
[23:26:40] <coldhead> __machine: sorry, i am distracted by management
[23:26:43] <Cork> jbooker: its the same as .delegate
[23:27:06] <Cork> ?.delegate @ jbooker
[23:27:06] <bot-t> jbooker, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[23:27:11] <coldhead> __machine: the best way i know to do what you are trying to do is to add that class at the point in your code where you insert the new data
[23:27:41] <jbooker> ooooh
[23:28:19] <Cork> jbooker: so if you bind it to a parent you later replace, the listner is gone
[23:28:23] <jbooker> Cork: no, i was doing that before, which is why it never worked, but now i am binding it to the .tabcontainer which never disappears
[23:28:30] <__machine> coldhead: i need to add the class to matching elements that are on the page from the start (in markup) and also for elements added to the page dynamically (by other code)
[23:28:46] <jbooker> Cork someone taught me that yesterday
[23:28:54] <Cork> jbooker: unless you bind another event listner that block it, it should work
[23:29:04] <jbooker> right OK i'm a bit further now - turns out i wasn't passing event into my anonymous function.
[23:29:23] <jbooker> now i need to work out why cakephp returns the WHOLE page instead of just the div contents on the subsequent clicks
[23:29:49] <jbooker> it works for the initial click from the original page, but then a link in the new div contents reloads a whole page, but within the div
[23:29:58] <jbooker> i.e. cakephp isn't seeing it as an ajax request
[23:31:25] <jbooker> aha! it's working in Chrome, but not in IE
[23:31:30] <jbooker> (now there's a surprise)
[23:31:36] <__machine> coldhead: would $('table').delegate('td:first-child', 'ready', {}, function() { $(this).addClass('first-child'); }) work?
[23:31:44] <coldhead> __machine: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/520127/
[23:31:54] <jbooker> Cork: should .load() always use xmlhttprequest, even in IE?
[23:31:59] <coldhead> no you can't bind to a load event for elements like that
[23:32:02] <coldhead> without livequery
[23:32:16] <jbooker> or whatever the IE version of xmlhttprequest is
[23:32:20] <coldhead> my code above just runs the line to add the class everytime you load more with ajax
[23:32:42] <coldhead> you could optimise it a lot but that's the only way i know of to do it
[23:33:35] <__machine> coldhead: it adds the class to all elements again and again tho? the problem i have is with a page that has a lot of markup... it gives me an error about a script slowing down the page and IE dies... this is not even adding anything dynamically, just on the first load of the page...
[23:33:52] <__machine> coldhead: im not sure if it is a problem with livequery... or with just adding a class to that many rows, period...
[23:34:02] <jbooker> Cork: thanks for all your help
[23:34:07] <jbooker> coldhead: yours too
[23:34:12] <coldhead> as Cork said, it's probably that intense selector
[23:34:27] <coldhead> happy hacking, jbooker
[23:34:59] <coldhead> __machine: there's no way you can just add the class on the serverside? :P
[23:36:39] <__machine> coldhead: was trying to avoid that... was trying to make IE7/8 compatible with css psuedo selectors without having to litter the markup with hard coded classes and use those for all browsers etc... but i guess any JS support for psuedo selectors that arent supported by the css selector engine are going to be slow on huge data sets...
[23:37:47] <coldhead> its as though IE is determined to hurt you either way :(
[23:37:59] <coldhead> no you can't have good pseudo selectors AND NO YOU CAN'T JUST FAKE THEM
[23:38:15] <coldhead> __machine: see if you can optimise the selector
[23:41:16] <__machine> coldhead: i can fake them on small pages... what about this... is there a way that i can NOT add the livequery (or delegate/whatever) on certain (large) pages, without having to hard code something in every page that i want to disable it?
[23:41:28] <jbooker> me again!
[23:41:47] <jbooker> it's all working, even in IE it was just being stupid, delted temp, cookies etc and now all working fine
[23:42:04] <__machine> coldhead: something like a counter of how many elements are affected by the livequery and if it reaches say 100 or whatever, it unbinds and doesnt add any more?
[23:42:10] <jbooker> so the next question - when i use .load() to load a url into a div, is there any way for me to wait until it is finished?
[23:42:26] <Zogot> Morning all
[23:42:54] <quicksilver> jbooker: use the callback.
[23:43:28] <jbooker> because once it's loaded, i want to get the first h2 tag to change my tab title. i can get the h2 fine, but it gets it from the page BEFORE the load (because the next line of code executes faster than the load)
[23:43:39] <__machine> coldhead: problem is that my js is loaded in the head, before the whole content of the page is ready
[23:43:43] <jbooker> quicksilver: ok, i was trying to avoid that, but if that's the only way
[23:45:47] <Cork> jbooker: .load provides support for callbacks
[23:45:55] <Cork> jbooker: so i don't see how that would be a problem
[23:46:40] <jbooker> Cork - but the callback has a set number of parameters, so i have no way of passing a reference to my div into it?
[23:46:52] <jbooker> .load( url [, data] [, complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)] )
[23:46:53] <Zogot> you do that inside the callback function
[23:46:58] <Cork> jbooker: scope it
[23:47:12] <jbooker> Zogot - but it could have come from anywhere!
[23:47:20] <jbooker> Cork: i don't understand 'scope it'
[23:47:37] <Cork> var my_parameters = {obj:1}; $().load('', function() { my_parameters });
[23:47:53] <jbooker> woah
[23:48:01] <Cork> jbooker: as long as the varaible exists before the anonymus function, its accessable
[23:48:24] <jbooker> but doesn't the spec say that i MUST pass responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest?
[23:48:38] <Cork> sure
[23:48:45] <Cork> but thats the function attributes
[23:48:51] <jbooker> OH
[23:48:53] <Cork> this is just a scope variable
[23:49:20] <jbooker> and because it's a sub-function (closure?) it can see its parent's variables?
[23:49:22] <Cork> a variable thats created in the parent scope, and inherited in the callback
[23:49:29] <Cork> yes
[23:49:47] <Cork> as long as the varaible is defined before the sub function
[23:49:51] <jbooker> ok so what does obj:1 mean, a variable called 'obj' with a value of 1?
[23:50:01] <Cork> jbooker: junk data :)
[23:50:07] <jbooker> because {} is an array right?
[23:50:11] <Cork> jbooker: you can put what ever you want in there
[23:50:17] <Cork> no its an object [] is array
[23:50:22] <jbooker> ah thanks
[23:50:35] <jbooker> so i access it with myParameters.obj
[23:50:41] <Cork> object is {key:value}, array is [value,value,value,value,value}
[23:50:47] <Cork> jbooker: yes
[23:50:51] <jbooker> thankyou, afk
[23:50:59] <Cork> jbooker: or use separat variables or what ever you want
[23:51:46] <Whirl3d> what is a good selector for the reset and submit buttons (without using classes)?
[23:53:34] <Zogot> Why not using classes?
[23:53:39] <Xotix> Can someone help me on how to use fancybox with an iframe?
[23:54:05] <Whirl3d> not my form, to start with
[23:54:50] <Xotix> form.submit()?
[23:55:12] <Xotix> just id?  LoginForm, CresteUserForm?
[23:55:49] <Whirl3d> ":submit"
[23:55:58] <Whirl3d> found it...thanks
