[00:13:58] <liam> I am trying to use jquery tabs with its default e.g. $('#item').tabs (); . However with each tab select it reloads the entire page into the tabs content div.... any ideas?
[00:14:36] <lazyPower> liam whats your link look like?
[00:15:01] <lazyPower> rather, open a jsfiddle witht he code so we can look at it.
[00:15:05] <liam> lazyPower: you mean for the tab links?
[00:20:39] <thun> I have a script.js that has a function that calls a function that access a variable set in the .html page that called the script in the first place. The var in the .html page is not available to the script
[00:20:49] <thun> can anyone help me with this?
[00:22:46] <liam> lazyPower: Thats my code http://jsfiddle.net/lanks/3pSFR/
[00:22:54] <liam> doesn't seem to run on jsfiddle...
[00:24:02] <krz> at http://www.uploadify.com/forums/discussion/1416/uploading-to-amazon-s3/p1 terebentina comment. instead of using ${filename} in 'key:' how can i display the extension of the filename?
[00:25:25] <krz> javascript
[00:25:46] <liam> lazyPower: there now it has the resources http://jsfiddle.net/lanks/3pSFR/
[00:31:39] <cypha> does setTimeout always make the div disappear?
[00:31:50] <cypha> or is that .fade that always makes the div disappear?
[00:32:14] <cypha> cuz I'm trying to have it disappear, but not shift all the elements below it
[00:32:40] <cypha> so I just want the text and background color to become hidden
[00:32:48] <cypha> but the fade effect is desired as well
[00:34:59] <coldhead> ?fadeTo @ cypha
[00:34:59] <bot-t> cypha, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[00:35:22] <coldhead> .fadeTo(500, 0) will fade it out but not display:none it
[00:35:22] <cypha> thank you coldhead
[00:35:29] <coldhead> so it will still occupy space on the page
[00:37:47] <cypha> coldhead, http://paste.ofcode.org/35PmLkQRCGvVU4pDgQcvTZj
[00:37:58] <cypha> is the setTimeout redundant?
[00:38:53] <bapi_> I need some help with jquery animate, what i want: my background to go from opacity: 1 down to 0 and then back again
[00:48:37] <bapi_> is it possible to change the background opacity with jquery?
[00:48:51] <bapi_> body { background: url(bg.png); }
[00:49:02] <bapi_> bg.png to 40% opacity
[00:50:01] <k1t> anyone know how i could make this look a bit better? http://pastie.org/2664524
[00:50:20] <k1t> i was having a hard time with my data types and math operations, i think i could lose some parseFloat action there, im just not sure
[00:54:51] <coldhead> bapi_: you can't animate background images with jQuery
[00:55:04] <coldhead> you have to put the bg img in a div by itself and animate that
[00:55:49] <coldhead> cypha: that setTimeout is fine IF you want to wait 2 seconds before you fade
[00:55:54] <coldhead> otherwise you don't need it
[00:56:07] <cypha> oh, i see
[00:57:13] <coldhead> this paste site is nice, cypha
[00:57:31] <coldhead> thx
[00:57:47] <cypha> sure thing :)
[00:58:53] <cypha> coldhead, what's your text editor of choice?
[00:59:18] <coldhead> i use emacs because i am terribly old
[01:01:12] <cypha> :) so does the guy that created it
[01:01:23] <cypha> pretty sure he has a script, I'll ask when he gets back
[01:07:23] <krz> when doing alert(). how do you create a new line?
[01:07:25] <krz> \n ?
[01:08:43] <Coderah> krz: or \r\n both should have pretty much the same outcome.
[01:08:51] <krz> thanks
[01:13:16] <krz> at http://www.uploadify.com/forums/discussion/1416/uploading-to-amazon-s3/p1 terebentina comment. in the 'key:' section. where does ${filename} come from?
[01:14:56] <cypha> is logging in without a refresh frowned upon?
[01:16:09] <cypha> krz, JSON maybe?
[01:16:22] <coldhead> krz: it's probably an amazon thing
[01:17:01] <coldhead> cypha: if you're sending the password in cleartext, yes, that is frowned upon
[01:17:23] <cypha> meaning, make sure it's https if I don't have a refresh
[01:17:28] <cypha> ?
[01:17:32] <coldhead> yes
[01:17:40] <cypha> k
[01:17:56] <coldhead> but to do https, you have to be on an https page...
[01:18:11] <cypha> right
[01:18:17] <coldhead> and you'll still be https until you do a refresh
[01:18:30] <cypha> i intend to make the whole site https
[01:18:37] <coldhead> excellent choice :)
[01:18:49] <cypha> it's free, right?
[01:18:50] <cypha> :)
[01:19:14] <coldhead> it is a little slower
[01:19:19] <coldhead> that's the price
[01:19:26] <cypha> worth the security, imo
[01:19:40] <cypha> i'll optimize everywhere else
[01:20:02] <cypha> coldhead, what if I have other elements on the page that depend on whether the user is logged in or not
[01:20:16] <cypha> will it be a big hastle?
[01:20:34] <coldhead> it depends on what you mean by "depend"
[01:20:48] <coldhead> it should be fine
[01:21:02] <cypha> for example, certain elements will only show if the user is logged in
[01:21:23] <coldhead> can you just hide them in CSS?
[01:21:50] <coldhead> body.loggedin .pleasesignin {display:none}
[01:21:51] <cypha> can't, cuz then they can just make them show with firebug or whatever
[01:22:01] <coldhead> body .pleasesignin {display:block}
[01:22:09] <coldhead> oh right
[01:22:20] <coldhead> then maybe you will have to ajax load them
[01:22:29] <cypha> i haven't worked with ajax before
[01:22:44] <coldhead> it's easy, you'll be fine
[01:22:48] <cypha> so i was wondering how difficult of a task that was
[01:22:49] <cypha> oh ok
[01:22:50] <cypha> good
[01:23:01] <coldhead> check out the examples for a simple function like load()
[01:23:12] <coldhead> ?ajax.load
[01:23:14] <bot-t> coldhead, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[01:24:05] <cypha> basically, I guess I need to access /login and get the returned headers?
[01:24:17] <cypha> is that with the load function?
[01:24:38] <coldhead> what headers do you mean?
[01:24:41] <coldhead> the http headers?
[01:24:44] <cypha> yeah
[01:24:54] <coldhead> i have never done that with jQuery
[01:24:58] <coldhead> it might be possible!
[01:25:10] <cypha> i'm not even saying I know I need it
[01:25:13] <coldhead> but can't you just read text or json from /login ?
[01:25:17] <cypha> I was just postulating on how to log in
[01:25:28] <cypha> yes I can
[01:25:46] <coldhead> you should probably read some ajax login security tutorials
[01:25:53] <coldhead> there should be a lot of good examples
[01:29:45] <cypha> coldhead, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/AjaxForm
[01:29:56] <cypha> ohh, it uses php
[01:30:04] <cypha> nm
[01:32:51] <hi88is> Hey Gang!
[01:33:39] <cypha> coldhead, I cannot find a single good example
[01:33:50] <cypha> could you please recommend a link?
[01:34:12] <hi88is> Got a real quick syntax issue with my n00b attempt to implement delay() - please take a look. it'll take you a nanosecond to write it correctly so I can learn what I'm not doing right... http://pastebin.com/pDNMVwhL ( THANKS!! )
[01:39:16] <ravenzz> hi88is css("display","none") = hide()
[01:39:50] <ravenzz> css("height","25") = height(25)
[01:40:03] <ravenzz> css("display","block") =  show()
[01:40:10] <hi88is> that's cool and a hell of a lot easier to write
[01:40:10] <hi88is> thanks
[01:40:36] <hi88is> what's the issue with the delay not being called?
[01:41:11] <ravenzz> also $('.close') within the function should be replaced with $(this)
[01:41:19] <ravenzz> hi88is is .close a link?
[01:41:42] <hi88is> yes, close is a href class
[01:42:09] <ravenzz> well
[01:42:20] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ hi88is
[01:42:20] <bot-t> hi88is, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[01:42:35] <ravenzz> hi88is can you paste an html snippet too?
[01:42:48] <hi88is> surely
[01:43:08] <cypha> does this look like a good ajax login tutorial? http://woork.blogspot.com/2007/10/login-using-ajax-and-php.html
[01:43:28] <cypha> I'm looking for the most basic implementation so I can better learn how it work
[01:43:28] <cypha> s
[01:43:29] <hi88is> http://pastebin.com/Vm2hHYeV
[01:44:26] <ExpFist> if you want to teach people how to be vulnerable to SQL injections
[01:44:27] <ExpFist> Sure :V
[01:45:09] <Woet> or how to avoid any type of indentation/readable code at all
[01:45:26] <Woet> or how to needlessly open and close PHP and use HTML comments for PHP code
[01:45:36] <Woet> or how to store passwords plaintext
[01:45:45] <Woet> or how to use depreciated old mysql_* functions
[01:45:49] <hi88is> haha
[01:45:51] <ravenzz> hi88is ok, what are you trying to do?
[01:47:16] <ravenzz> show/hide the #text_hide ?
[01:47:56] <hi88is> hide the text, change a div height from 400 to 25, hide an a href with class open
[01:48:10] <hi88is> show an a href with class close
[01:49:02] <Woet> cypha: do you need more reasons NOT to read it or is this sufficient?
[01:49:38] <cypha> haha
[01:49:44] <cypha> i had no idea you guys were talking to me up there
[01:49:58] <cypha> ok, so can you recommend a good example of implementing it?
[01:50:11] <Woet> you already have the server side code?
[01:50:48] <cypha> yes
[01:51:08] <Woet> http://www.developertutorials.com/tutorials/ajax/getting-started-with-ajax-in-jquery-874/
[01:51:10] <Woet> looks okay
[01:53:09] <cypha> Woet, this looks like a great tutorial, thanks!
[01:53:26] <cypha> very methodical
[01:54:41] <hi88is> ravenzz: You can see what I'm attempting here if you click close and then click open
[01:54:42] <hi88is> http://www.thepixelflow.com/clients/hatch/home/photography/
[01:54:58] <hi88is> it's close - if i could get the delay() to work - it'd be good to go
[01:55:12] <hi88is> thanks for the syntax lesson - i'll implement that next time i'm writing functions
[02:01:32] <ravenzz> hi88is i am back, sorry
[02:01:47] <hi88is> it's all good mate
[02:01:47] <ravenzz> hi88is http://jsfiddle.net/VHHkb/1/
[02:02:23] <hi88is> you're helping me - so, who am i to be impatient :P
[02:02:33] <hi88is> wow - this jsfiddle thing is sweet
[02:02:41] <hi88is> i'll be using this mucho :)
[02:03:14] <hi88is> the code you wrote has some really cool stuff in it
[02:03:37] <hi88is> particularly the use of vars and parents
[02:03:39] <ravenzz> oh you need a slide
[02:03:40] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/VHHkb/2/
[02:04:47] <hi88is> can you explain this please:
[02:04:47] <hi88is> function(e){
[02:04:48] <hi88is>         e.preventDefault();
[02:05:29] <ravenzz> e = the current event
[02:05:51] <ravenzz> preventDefault() = the default action of the event will not be triggered.
[02:06:12] <pendergast> how do I use sortable so that the list doesn't collapse when I lift (drag) an element?
[02:06:12] <ravenzz> sorry my english sucks you'll find a better explaination here http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:06:16] <hi88is> what would the default action be?
[02:06:20] <hi88is> your english is great
[02:06:46] <ravenzz> hi88is the default action in this case is "load the link you clicked on"
[02:07:09] <hi88is> and of course, that in this case is just #
[02:07:48] <hi88is> humm - ok - i understand - just never seen this feature used before and always thought that jQuery calls on href values always where #
[02:07:52] <hi88is> thanks again
[02:08:16] <hi88is> now, why is it that you have two instances of .parent()?
[02:08:32] <ravenzz> hi88is http://jsfiddle.net/8Hesh/
[02:08:33] <hi88is> is that because you're doing: $('.container .control')
[02:08:59] <hi88is> sweet
[02:09:09] <hi88is> so you can attach jQuery events to any href value
[02:09:11] <hi88is> nice to know
[02:09:12] <hi88is> wow
[02:09:26] <ravenzz> no because you wrap the link into an H3
[02:09:39] <ravenzz> so $('.control').parent() = H3
[02:09:53] <ravenzz> $('.control').parent().parent() = .container
[02:10:55] <hi88is> ok - let me read over the code again and try to translate it conceptually :P
[02:11:25] <hi88is> ok
[02:11:33] <hi88is> i think i understand .parent() now
[02:11:51] <ravenzz> you can even read the docs
[02:12:03] <ravenzz> ?selectors @ hi88is
[02:12:03] <bot-t> hi88is, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1ñ3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[02:12:05] <hi88is> basically - you are making this = container by using .parent().parent()
[02:12:06] <hi88is> Right?
[02:12:33] <ravenzz> I am going up to the DOM
[02:12:51] <hi88is> Right
[02:12:53] <ravenzz> you have nested elements into the DOM you know.
[02:13:45] <ravenzz> so it's like .container > H3 > $(this) = (the link with the class .control)
[02:14:22] <hi88is> yea, cool - we're saying the same thing in a different way :)
[02:14:30] <hi88is> means i understand. awesome.
[02:14:32] <ravenzz> yes
[02:15:12] <ravenzz> If you read the doc, jQuery is really simple
[02:15:13] <hi88is> then - .find('.details') = within (this) find the element with a class of details
[02:15:51] <hi88is> i've been bookmarking all the links you've been directing me to :)
[02:15:57] <ravenzz> yes, it's looking for descendant that have the class .details
[02:16:40] <hi88is> yup
[02:18:26] <hi88is> then you've created a variable called action where you are checking to see if the text with a class of control is Open or Close?
[02:19:11] <hi88is> not 100% sure what this means: 'Open' ? 'Close' : 'Open';
[02:19:11] <hi88is>         $(this).text(action);
[02:20:29] <ravenzz> it is an if ... the short hand
[02:21:12] <ravenzz> if ( $(this).text() == 'Open' ) { action = 'Close' } else { action = 'Open' }
[02:22:32] <hi88is> Then here: $(this).text(action);  - you are just setting the text to whatever the action checks out to be in the if statement?
[02:28:16] <ravenzz> yes
[02:28:20] <ravenzz> ?text @ hi88is
[02:28:21] <bot-t> hi88is, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[02:28:58] <ravenzz> text('foo') or text(variable) replace it
[02:29:46] <hi88is> you've blown my mind rav and shown me how much i have to learn - thank you very much for showing me this stuff instead of just explaining an improper use of delay()
[02:31:14] <ravenzz> you're welcome
[02:32:38] <hi88is> are you in here often or have any other method of contact? i promise i won't bother you :P
[02:32:47] <cypha> I have a JSON array being returned to my html template file.
[02:33:08] <hi88is> i'm just thinking if i hit a wall like this i'd be able to reach out quickly - it happens like once ever couple months :D
[02:33:09] <cypha> in my template file, I have {{ if username }}
[02:33:18] <cypha> and only then would it show the following html
[02:33:39] <cypha> the username value is returned in the JSON array
[02:33:57] <cypha> but if there's no refresh, how can I get username to recognize it's newfound value?
[02:41:28] <ravenzz> hi88is you'll find help here anytime you'll join this channell
[02:41:40] <hi88is> yep yep
[02:42:00] <hi88is> some people aren't as willing to help as you though - or as good of a teacher.
[02:42:18] <hi88is> you know how it is on irc - some ppl would rather make fun of people than assist :P
[02:44:54] <ravenzz> well basically they want you to read and learn by yourself instead of looking for I teacher, I would agree with this
[02:44:58] <ravenzz> anyway i have to go
[02:45:02] <ravenzz> see you
[02:45:10] <ravenzz> s/I/a
[02:46:40] <hi88is> cheers
[02:47:25] <cypha> Woet, still around?
[02:47:30] <Woet> probably
[02:48:16] <cypha> :)
[02:48:28] <cypha> firstly, great tutorial
[02:48:47] <cypha> two things though
[02:48:57] <cypha> firstly, I need to "deserialize" a json array
[02:49:03] <cypha> and I'm not sure how to do that
[02:50:22] <cypha> and second is, once the person is authenticated, I need to hide the login forms and show--> 'Hi',${username}
[02:55:56] <dabear> cypha: are you using jquery templates plugin? it is documented here: http://api.jquery.com/template-tag-if/
[02:56:18] <cypha> actually I am
[02:56:25] <cypha> oooh, niceee
[02:56:54] <cypha> thanks dabear
[02:59:35] <Gangans> hi
[02:59:54] <Gangans> is there any way to use one variable in two libraries?
[03:00:18] <Gangans> or if i use var it will work ewerywhere and I missed something?
[03:01:22] <lazyPower> Gangans: i think you're referring to a global, and while its possible and ok, it goes against best practices. You're better off to not pollute the global namespace in jscript any more than you have to.
[03:02:07] <dabear> Gangans: libraries are just that - a collection of functions and code - they do not change the language in anyway
[03:02:37] <Gangans> hm, ok, then I have another question. I can find user variables in firebug?
[03:02:37] <dabear> they can therefore also access global variables
[03:02:50] <dabear> what is a user variable?
[03:03:02] <Gangans> used*
[03:03:09] <lazyPower> Gangans: anything thats active in the current scope will be displayed in firebug.
[03:04:14] <dabear> you can set breakpoints, refresh the page, and js execution will be halted where the breakpoint is set
[03:04:39] <dabear> you can then use the console tab and have access to the scope where the breakpoint is
[03:05:02] <Gangans> hmm, so I need dev version of library
[03:05:27] <dabear> you should always have a non-minified version when you debug
[03:05:38] <Gangans> yes, I see
[03:05:55] <dabear> ( chrome can un-minify/beautify code on the fly for you)
[03:06:32] <Gangans> it seems i dont need this
[03:06:54] <Gangans> I am using some multiupload library
[03:07:06] <dabear> that depends on what your issue is
[03:07:16] <dabear> and what needs to be debugged
[03:07:57] <cypha> dabear, how do I get ahold of the JSON array I returned from the server?
[03:08:06] <Gangans> the goal is to get a var who counts how many files is goint to get uploaded with that
[03:08:19] <cypha> dabear, http://paste.ofcode.org/naGBTP6mEmraS7Ecgzxuep
[03:08:29] <Gangans> and then I will use it on serverside
[03:08:34] <cypha> the script is lines 15-27
[03:10:04] <dabear> cypha: data should be your json from the server
[03:10:40] <dabear> cypha: set a breakpoint in firebug on that line: --> $("#status p").html(data);
[03:10:46] <dabear> and see what data is
[03:11:06] <dabear> you can go to the console tab and just type data
[03:11:22] <dabear> when the break occurs
[03:13:16] <cypha> dabear, not sure what to do in the console tab, but on the right side I got a column that is showing me data being Object { username="xyz" }
[03:13:24] <dabear> cypha: what is happening? isn't the data set ? maybe you need to check if the server actually returns data. also, to parse the data, see ?parsejson
[03:13:25] <bot-t> cypha, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[03:13:30] <cypha> (right side at the script tab)
[03:14:07] <dabear> then data.username should be xyz in js
[03:14:33] <cypha> aah, ok, cool
[03:15:03] <cypha> dabear, so does that become a global variable?
[03:15:20] <dabear> cypha: no, it does not.
[03:15:43] <dabear> did you type it out in the console now when the breakpoint was set?
[03:15:58] <cypha> there's no where in the console for me to type
[03:16:37] <dabear> ok, then you're pebkacing :p
[03:17:22] <dabear> but anyway, data is the first parameter to the callbackfunction which is run when the ajax req is completed
[03:17:32] <cypha> 60 results on google for PEBKACing
[03:17:36] <cypha> are they all you?
[03:17:48] <cypha> =P
[03:17:52] <dabear> cypha: try define:pebkac
[03:18:23] <dabear> ?ud pebkac
[03:18:25] <bot-t> dabear, pebkac - problem exists between keyboard and chair
[03:18:28] <cypha> haha
[03:19:31] <dabear> but seriously, what's the "problem" ?
[03:19:41] <dabear> seems you have everything under control?
[03:19:47] <cypha> aah, command editor
[03:19:58] <cypha> didn't know that existed
[03:20:31] <cypha> how would I use data.username in the {{if}} template tag if it's not global?
[03:20:43] <cypha> {{if username}}
[03:20:50] <cypha> {{if data.username}}
[03:21:57] <dabear> cypha: when the ajax request is complete, the template is already rendered
[03:22:13] <Gangans> I'm using plupload, but it seems like i can't fide dev version of it
[03:22:15] <cypha> damnit, same issue my current template has
[03:22:18] <Gangans> but it have some api
[03:22:45] <Gangans> is there any way to get how many files is uploaded from it? -_-
[03:23:13] <Gangans> and can someone say what really ir "runtime" ?
[03:23:13] <apollo13> cypha: dude didn't you read anything Funkybob told you in #django?
[03:23:19] <cypha> dabear, so only way to hide the login form fields, and show "Hello John" is by hiding and showing the corresponding elements?
[03:23:23] <dabear> you need to update the generated html element by the template, cypha. or you need to re-generate (or postpone creating template)
[03:23:36] <cypha> apollo13, I thought jquery.tmpl would be realtime
[03:23:50] <apollo13> obviously not
[03:23:55] <dabear> cypha: there is no automatic updating
[03:23:58] <cypha> not obvious
[03:23:59] <cypha> at least to me
[03:24:19] <dabear> you could look into backbone.js , but that seems overkill
[03:24:21] <apollo13> knockoutjs would support the automatic updating like you want
[03:24:51] <apollo13> or just rerender the template everytime data changes
[03:25:10] <cypha> apollo13, is that causing a page refresh?
[03:25:16] <apollo13> -_-
[03:25:42] <Gangans> I found http://www.plupload.com/plupload/docs/api/index.html#class_plupload.QueueProgress.html-queued here the queued what is really that what I need
[03:26:01] <Gangans> but can someone help me and say how to get it that count to variable?
[03:26:09] <cypha> dabear, which solution do you think you'd go with?
[03:27:40] <dabear> cypha: I would generate the template only once. I would render both the if and else-parts always, but hide the one that is not relevant
[03:28:07] <cypha> dabear, so if there's sensitive information, I must refresh
[03:28:09] <dabear> then when the ajax request is completed, I would toggleClass("hide show") on both the parts
[03:28:22] <dabear> huh?
[03:28:26] <dabear> why refresh?
[03:29:19] <dabear> are you btw using django or jquery templates?
[03:29:29] <cypha> wait nm, I'm populating the element's value/contents with the json data anyway
[03:29:50] <cypha> jinja2 actually
[03:29:58] <cypha> but I have jquery templates on there as well
[03:32:37] <dabear> cypha: look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/5Mj4W/
[03:32:46] <dabear> that's how I would do it
[03:33:10] <dabear> sorry
[03:33:11] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/5Mj4W/1/
[03:33:12] <dabear> there
[03:33:26] <dabear> ofc you need to modify it some, though
[03:33:32] <dabear> but that's the general idea
[03:34:56] <cypha> omg dabear, that's wonderful
[03:34:58] <cypha> thank you so much
[03:35:28] <dabear> request.user.first_name would not be defined when not logged in though
[03:35:41] <dabear> so you need to figure out a solution to that..
[03:35:46] <cypha> right, that's fine
[03:35:52] <cypha> <style> is jquery.tmpl?
[03:36:13] <dabear> <style> is html
[03:36:25] <dabear> <style> defines a style block
[03:36:32] <dabear> e.g. css code
[03:36:45] <cypha> oh ok, don't think i've seen that before
[03:37:30] <dabear> you haven't seen css before? 0o
[03:37:46] <cypha> haha
[03:37:50] <cypha> apparently not
[03:38:06] <cypha> so I don't see where the script fits into this
[03:39:19] <cypha> cuz that style just does what jinja2 was doing directly
[03:39:26] <cypha> oh, i see
[03:39:27] <dabear> yes, and?
[03:39:51] <dabear> you hide/show loggedin/logon divs when needed..
[03:39:53] <cypha> then the script just says to follow #loggedin or #logon?
[03:40:08] <cypha> kk, gotcha
[03:40:12] <dabear> don't you know html? :p
[03:40:17] <dabear> or css:p
[03:40:27] <cypha> it's js i don't know well yet
[03:40:36] <cypha> html and css I get by :)
[03:43:52] <dabear> $("#logon").hide()
[03:44:04] <dabear> $("#loggedin").hide()
[03:44:14] <dabear> and .show() when the ajax reqeust returns
[04:03:00] <Acolyte> is there a way to make PUT request without jQuery overriding it?

[05:03:37] <barfoo365> Is there a way to use getscript to call two external javascript files sequentially/
[05:04:39] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: $.getScript("script.js",function(){ ... });$.getScript("script2.js",function(){ ... }); should work
[05:05:19] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : Thanks for that ill give it a try
[05:05:30] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: You're welcome
[05:07:32] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : The function part of that line, the part represented by ...  what should i put there?
[05:07:58] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: Whatever you want to happen when the script has loaded
[05:08:43] <barfoo365> The js files are animation that start automatically
[05:09:36] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: If you don't need it, you can just use $.getScript("script.js") I think
[05:10:04] <barfoo365> hmm i have tried that, it calls the first file fine but when the animation finished it doesnt launch the 2nd one
[05:10:27] <barfoo365> Would i need some sort of stop command in the js file to let it know it has finished and it can launch the next?
[05:10:57] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: Yes
[05:12:43] <barfoo365> my js animation file is using deferred pipes on multiple divs, is there a way to stop them all globally?  Or would i have to add a stop command to each pipe
[05:14:00] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: Not sure what you mean by deferred pipes, do you mean, as in div1.style.color=div2.style.color="red" ?
[05:15:28] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : http://jsfiddle.net/eXeVw/
[05:15:56] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: I'll have a look, back in a minute.

[05:25:27] <thekirbylover> barfoo365: I never knew about Deferred and piping beforehand, and I only read the documentation quickly a few minutes ago, so sorry if I'm wrong.
[05:26:23] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : Thanks for that, the issue with that code is that the animations now run sequentially within that js.
[05:26:55] <_ramix_> hi, what's the simple way to post a hash array? thanks!
[05:27:13] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : But you have given me an idea for looping it though :)
[05:35:31] <yvorl_> Hello! new to irc and jquery ; can I read files without server code? (get json etc)?
[05:36:37] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : I have managed to get it to work kind of, both the js files display but they don't wait until one has finished
[05:36:37] <thekirbylover> yvorl_: If the json is on your server, just use $.getJSON("filename.json",function(data) { alert("JSON loaded"); });
[05:37:11] <yvorl_> the files would be on a local drive
[05:37:17] <yvorl_> not on the internet
[05:37:39] <Nitrxgen> anyone know if there's a channel for xhtml help?
[05:37:56] <barfoo365> #xhtml??
[05:38:08] <thekirbylover> yvorl_: I don't think you can read json data from the file:// protocol in some browsers
[05:38:19] <barfoo365> or the #html channel would more than likely be bale to help
[05:38:51] <Nitrxgen> thar be no #xhtml but I'll give it a shot in #html, thanks
[05:38:54] <yvorl_> any data? like a txt file?
[05:39:36] <yvorl_> I know that seem like a very stupid situation given the internet
[05:39:41] <thekirbylover> yvorl_: From what I've heard, some browsers give an error when you make an Ajax request for a file on the disk
[05:40:21] <thekirbylover> yvorl_: Even if the page that requested it is also from the file:// protocol
[05:40:33] <yvorl_> I see
[05:40:53] <thekirbylover> yvorl_: Your best choice would be to use JSONP. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[05:41:03] <yvorl_> theyere givin me a hard time :)

[05:42:19] <Ang3> hey guys, i'm playing with the sortable of jquery UI. Is there a way to get the title of the portlet?
[05:42:47] <Ang3> iu mean the tewt like "feeds," "news" in this ex : http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets
[05:44:29] <barfoo365> thekirbylover : I have wrapped the entire animation in a function and called it at the top of my js file.  But for some reason the two called js files are running simultaneously
[05:45:42] <yvorl_> you see theres my problem: I work in bigcorp, I'm creating a little protal for my team (50-60 people) but I don't get server acces from them, so any method requesting server data won't work, I've to do something that works offline
[05:56:55] <Ang3> any hits ?

[06:14:02] <amitprakash> Hi.. is there a way that can take css3 attributes and convert them to vendor specific onse ? like gradient to -moz/webkit/o-gradient:
[06:15:11] <Nitrxgen> I don't know jQuery like most people here but I'd guess you would have to specify them all.
[06:15:31] <Nitrxgen> or find a plugin
[06:15:55] <Nitrxgen> amirite, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/gradient ?
[06:16:04] <Nitrxgen> sorry, amitprakash **
[06:16:53] <amitprakash> hmm
[06:21:20] <dabear> amitprakash: depending on what you really wanna do, there is $.cssHooks available, that .css() will use
[06:22:09] <dabear> so that css("gradient") will return the correct vendor specific one
[06:22:32] <dabear> you would have to code that for you self though, or find someone who already did the work

[07:02:25] <intellilogic> Can you use HTML5 datasets as selectors?  Like this:  <ul><li data-aj='{"Bar":"Foo"}'>   ...    $(".aj_menu li").data("aj").click(function(e){
[07:03:09] <thekirbylover> Try $($(".aj_menu li").data("aj")).click(function(e){
[07:11:33] <Jayflux> intellilogic you can use them as normal attribute = selectors too, $('div[data-aj="value"]');
[07:14:08] <intellilogic> JayFlux:  Good info :)  Sweet!  So I could do $('.aj_menu li[data-aj]').click(function(e){
[07:14:48] <intellilogic> Shit, I need to write some more into this and get some test HTML ;)~
[07:20:27] <fuchstronaut> how to pass an array of arguments to a function? arguments.join(',') produces a single string, so its just one argument.

[07:56:12] <someguy> hey all, if I declare a variable outside of a click function,  then set it, why would jquery be resetting my variable to the original value after the click function completes?
[07:58:44] <thekirbylover> someguy: If you use ‚Äúvar‚Äù before the variable name in the click function, it becomes part of the local scope, so only the click function can read what you change it to
[07:59:11] <thekirbylover> someguy: But if you don't use ‚Äúvar‚Äù before the name, it should be fine.
[07:59:12] <someguy> i didnt
[07:59:23] <someguy> i used var in the global scope, not inside the click
[08:00:08] <someguy> and if i console.log inside the click, i get the right values
[08:00:21] <someguy> but if i console.log after the click, i get the original
[08:00:35] <someguy> when do console.log functions execute? inline or asynchronous
[08:00:36] <someguy> ?
[08:01:41] <thekirbylover> someguy: I believe they're inline
[08:01:46] <someguy> hmmmm
[08:02:14] <someguy> then i dunno why my var is getting reset
[08:02:22] <someguy> or losing the values i set in the click
[08:02:39] <sodapop> is there any lightbox alike using jquery-ui themes ?

[08:14:01] <someguy> i cant stop it
[08:14:02] <juha_> someguy: .stop(1,1) if memory serves
[08:14:04] <someguy> i need to wait till its done
[08:14:24] <dabear> ?animate
[08:14:26] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:14:31] <juha_> someguy: then put your code on callback
[08:14:38] <dabear> someguy: run the code inside the callback
[08:14:42] <juha_> someguy: which you can see on bottttttt's line
[08:15:02] <juha_> callbacks are awesome
[08:15:07] <juha_> i was in heaven when i first discovered them
[08:15:08] <someguy> i have an animate inside of an each function..
[08:15:12] <someguy> so the callback doesn't do me any good
[08:15:32] <someguy> i need to know when ALL the animation is finished, not just the current iteration of the .each
[08:15:59] <juha_> $.each("div",function(){$(this).animate({..},500, function() { yay_run_this(); });});
[08:16:03] <someguy> and i can't use a callback on the each
[08:16:04] <juha_> oh
[08:16:07] <someguy> (wish i could)
[08:16:12] <juha_> easy
[08:16:32] <someguy> do tell :)
[08:16:36] <juha_> but my idea is too hacky
[08:16:41] <someguy> lol
[08:16:44] <someguy> how hacky?
[08:17:07] <juha_> first get length, then setup interval to see if all loops have runned.. if(i >= length) {yay();}
[08:17:11] <juha_> and now someone will ban me
[08:17:18] <someguy> lol
[08:17:26] <someguy> any non-hacky ideas?
[08:17:38] <someguy> ahhh wait
[08:17:42] <someguy> i have a better idea :)

[08:18:51] <someguy> something like that
[08:18:58] <someguy> i think i have another way to get what i need
[08:18:59] <juha_> my idea was really bad now that i think of it.. :D
[08:19:03] <someguy> lol
[08:19:06] <juha_> really, really bad
[08:19:54] <rgr> is there a trick or approach to do something like : return the maximum height of all elements before the correct one of a certain class?
[08:20:03] <rgr> s/correct/current
[08:23:03] <thekirbylover> rgr: var heights=0; $("*").each(function(){ if($(this).is(".myclass")){ return false; } heights+=$(this).height(); });
[08:23:33] <thekirbylover> rgr: Not sure if that works, but try it out
[08:30:40] <rgr> thanks will do
[08:33:11] <rgr> probably a css thing, but what do I need to be reading up if I want to insert an element into the dom using jq but that element sits over the top of the ones that follow?
[08:34:21] <dabear> rgr: my bet is that you want to using position: absolute|relative together with z-index
[08:34:42] <dabear> note that z-index does not work if you position is not defined
[08:35:01] <rgr> absolute|relative is a valid value?
[08:35:19] <rgr> I tried absolute but the following divs follow it.
[08:35:42] <dabear> omg
[08:35:56] <dabear> relative OR absolute
[08:36:54] <rgr> it could have been some css "trick" (god knows theres enough of them) ;)
[08:37:01] <rgr> but yeah absolute sounds correct.
[08:40:23] <juha_> i just wrote awesome comment to my code: if id is
[08:40:24] <juha_> ugh
[08:41:26] <rgr> and it is and wasnt working because I forgot the "#" in the selector. doh.
[08:41:54] <intellilogic> $('nav li[data-aj]')  When you put something like that in squared brackets, does it have to = something to be a selector?
[08:42:59] <Enchilada> I'm finding that putting my jQuery code inside a plain <script type="text/javascript"></script> just before the closing </body> (and without any $(document).ready) is working just fine. But I want to make sure that this is a good approach. Is this approach robust? Are there any side-effects I should know about? Why, would I want to use $(document).ready instead?
[08:44:29] <intellilogic> Enchilada: there are problems with this method, i can't word it well, but when it finishes writing the code to the page, some portions might still not be ready
[08:45:05] <intellilogic> Enchilada: why are you avoiding doc ready?
[08:46:15] <Enchilada> intellilogic: well, i'm hiding some elements on doc start (by adding a CSS class with display:none; to them). I want to be 100% certain that no blinking (first visible for a split second, then invisible) occurs at startup.
[08:46:21] <Enchilada> is that guaranteed not to take place in doc.ready?
[08:47:16] <intellilogic> make them hidden before doc ready and then visible on doc ready, all at the top?  *shrug*
[08:47:40] <intellilogic> Try it
[08:49:12] <__shiftingcontro> hello, I am trying tablesorter , I followed twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ and http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and it doesn't work , here is my code, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/489907/. this code is generated by python script automatically, when i created different html file using hand written html it worked .
[09:07:14] <__shiftingcontro> some one there ?
[09:09:48] <_cb> my file structure is . DestDir->index.php, DestDir->myPhp, DestDir->Source,DestDir->htm->products. Index calls myPhp/Counters.php. Counters.php invokes source/page0.js a function inside page0.js does a .load(htm/products/filex.htm) filex.htm is loading but pictures are not unless I declare a full path (http...). What would be the relative path? /htm/product/graph.jpg is not working
[09:11:16] <juha_> i just noticed something really weird from one page that a company xyz did: login form divided into three different forms. one form per input, username, password, submit, WTF?! then they combine the values into one with javascript..
[09:13:43] <cakehero> juha_ fix that dude
[09:13:46] <cakehero> thats weaksauce
[09:20:49] <cypha> dabear, thanks for that
[09:21:28] <dabear> for what?
[09:23:56] <TeamColtra_Other> Can someone tell me where I am going wrong with this: http://paste2.org/p/1698991 --> It works, at first... but then it starts reloading new data, without clearing the old data... so in this case I am getting marquees that are overlapping
[09:29:16] <_cb> if jquery does a .load('dir0/dir1/page.htm') and page.htm has some jpg's. What should the src be in the jpg's? graph.jpg does not work, dir0/dir1/graph.jpg does not work. http... does work but I don't wan an absolute path
[09:38:46] <dabear> _cb: you would need to replace the src in the img tags by prepending  "dir0/dir1/" to each src
[09:40:21] <sasori> question: how to get or select the value inbetween <span> tags ? ... e.g   <div class="keys"><span>7</span><span>9</span></dvi> ...how wil i get 7 or 9 ?
[09:40:51] <e-anima> hi
[09:41:31] <e-anima> if i am inside an element already like: $('.views_horizontal_slider div.item-list li').hover( ... how can i select a div inside that selector to fade it?
[09:41:51] <_cb> dabear if write the htm as dir0/dir1/graph.jpg the graph does not load
[09:41:52] <e-anima> with $(this) i get the current hovered li but how to select something inside that li
[09:42:23] <e-anima> sasori i think there was a function for that
[09:42:28] <e-anima> but i cant remember the name
[09:43:00] <dabear> _cb: if you are at your web page root, and the graph is at dir0/dir1/graph.jpg  , then it should. or you messed up something :)
[09:43:23] <dabear> ?find @ e-anima
[09:43:24] <bot-t> e-anima, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:44:03] <dabear> sasori: $("div.keys span") ?
[09:44:17] <dabear> sasori: then use .each or .map to get the texts
[09:45:11] <e-anima> thx dabear i¬¥ll take a look
[09:45:13] <dabear> sasori: var textarray = $("div.keys span").map(function(){  return this.innerHTML;}).get() //now is an array
[09:46:14] <_cb> dabear running some tests to insure I did not mess something up.
[09:46:34] <e-anima> hm $(this).find('views-field-title').fadeIn(500); does not really work
[09:46:53] <dabear> e-anima: that is understandable
[09:47:06] <dabear> is that a valid css selector?
[09:47:22] <dabear> nope, unless you have a tag called <views-field-title>
[09:47:27] <dabear> which I doubt you have
[09:48:06] <e-anima> oh whops sure i dont ^^
[09:48:53] <e-anima> finding a tag is not helpful i need to find the class
[09:49:57] <wathek> Hi everybody
[09:50:35] <wathek> I don't understand why google maps doesn't fully show in my website : http://www.tiba-immobiliere.com/node/68 (the tab: Voir sur la carte)
[09:50:40] <wathek> could any one help me please ?
[09:51:22] <wathek> here's my code : http://pastebin.com/xMf8cHu1
[09:54:21] <dreinull> is there a known problem with datepicker? It opens up but I cannot chose a day.
[09:55:00] <falieson> I'm looking for an accordion plugin that will still allow someone doing a ctrl+f search to open up the relevant piece of text inside the accordion
[09:55:14] <falieson> anyone ever seen a plugin that could do that?
[09:55:28] <_cb> dabear you are right. I had a typo and assumed relative path was different when using a .load
[09:55:46] <dabear> have I ever been wrong? :)
[09:55:55] <e-anima> dabear i think thats it: $(this).children('.views-field-title').fadeIn(500);
[09:56:01] <falieson> bear is never wrong
[09:56:06] <falieson> *beer is never wrong
[09:56:19] <_cb> dabear I think once you thought you were wrong but later found out you were wrong ;)
[09:56:58] <dabear> nice, so when im wrong im eventually right anyways
[09:57:42] <dabear> e-anima: why did you change from find to children?
[09:57:54] <dabear> children just selects immediate children
[09:58:09] <dabear> both should work in this case though
[10:00:32] <Vilkku> hello, I'm looking for a pdf reader which I could use on my website (meaning that a user can read a pdf I have uploaded in the browser not using their own pdf reader but the one I provide them) - I've seen some online before, but I'm not sure if they actually use JS or if they are done in flash
[10:00:36] <falieson> so, searchable accordion - anyone got anything?
[10:00:40] <Vilkku> so, doe anyone have any recoomendations?
[10:01:22] <falieson> vikku http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/pdf
[10:01:40] <falieson> I think i've used zoho before
[10:01:41] <juha_> ugh i had the classic case of wrong selector once again. debugged code for 15 minutes to only notice that selector is wrong
[10:01:43] <dabear> falieson: that would be difficult, as ctrl+f only searches visible text.
[10:02:01] <falieson> dabear - ah, I didn't know that but that makes sense. dangit
[10:02:01] <Vilkku> falieson, thanks, I'll take a look
[10:02:03] <dabear> falieson: it *is* possible to overwrite ctrl/meta+f and implement your own
[10:02:10] <dabear> I've done it, but its buggy
[10:02:23] <falieson> I want to put my resume in an accordion but you know a lot of HR peeps just ctrl+f
[10:02:26] <dabear> and I've lost the code
[10:03:43] <falieson> can you think of an alt solution?
[10:03:57] <falieson> I'm still pretty new to UI stuff like css/jquery
[10:05:12] <falieson> dabear?
[10:05:13] <juha_> falieson: google documents has custom functionality for ctrl+f
[10:05:24] <juha_> falieson: so you could build your own ;)
[10:05:40] <falieson> juha_: build my own ... what?
[10:05:57] <falieson> I'm trying to jump away from the traditional paper resume on a computer screen
[10:06:00] <saba> I would like to get the element that called .submit () from within my live event handler of the submit event, bound to a form element. Now, I've checked out event.target and relatedTarget in the docs but none of these will give me this.
[10:06:15] <saba> but I've seen that activeElement in liveFired is what I want. But how realiable is this?
[10:06:25] <juha_> falieson: put your resume on linkedin and you're set for life ;)
[10:06:26] <saba> can I use event.liveFired.activeElement and be happy?
[10:06:33] <falieson> juha_: lol ain't that a joke!
[10:07:27] <juha_> falieson: linkedin is first place i check. but if you're building a fancy resume page with hidden stuff that you want to be searchable, custom functionality for ctrl-f could be a possibility. maybe not a good possibility but still...
[10:08:13] <dabear> I would think that having text in a resum√® not being displayed is a bad idea
[10:09:00] <falieson> juha_: I have a rcmnd at facebook for a sales position but my resume I submitted didn't mention any dev experience, which they said they would prefer... so I'm putting together something this resume to follow up with the hr guy on
[10:09:37] <falieson> so... they already have the piece of paper, and anyone looking at my site would.
[10:09:53] <falieson> that's why I want to build something mroe dynamic, take advantage of the fact that it's not a piece of paper and a computer, yah?
[10:10:05] <falieson> but still, that ctrl+f thing could be a prob
[10:10:35] <juha_> well, that would show them that you're great :P especially if you get it working properly for all different keyboard settings
[10:10:43] <falieson> haha
[10:10:48] <dabear> falieson: don't mess with the traditional CV format
[10:11:10] <falieson> maybe I just cheat and add an expand all to the accordion? <--- this seems easiest
[10:11:25] <dabear> dont do it
[10:11:27] <juha_> falieson: i actually imported my cv from linkedin and applied to facebook, then they said "fuck you, mister"
[10:11:30] <falieson> maybe a jS popup the first time someone presses ctrl+f telling them to do the expand-all
[10:11:31] <dabear> show all text
[10:11:47] <dabear> falieson: bad usability
[10:11:53] <falieson> or just skip the step, how about ctr+f hits the expand-all?
[10:12:11] <juha_> don't do that
[10:12:30] <falieson> lol, masters of jquery, please teach me! why o why shouldn't I?
[10:13:08] <falieson> dabear: I already have a pdf/paper-version they can download on the site as well if they don't like the fun stuff
[10:13:14] <juha_> falieson: if user does something that is familiar and you change that behaviour, they will be like WTF WTF I'm outta here!
[10:13:41] <dabear> juha_: you said it
[10:13:47] <falieson> juha_: well would it change the behavior? can it activate the expand-all and the browser would continue you to do the search
[10:14:11] <dabear> falieson: use a pdftohtml converter and add all the text from the cv on the web site
[10:14:32] <falieson> dabear: yawn, they've already got the paper - that's how they got to the site!
[10:14:42] <dabear> falieson: point is, you are implementing something the user doesn't expect - and that makes them wanna leave
[10:15:21] <Hopsy> ?global
[10:15:21] <falieson> yeah, I get it
[10:15:24] <bot-t> Hopsy, Properties of the Global jQuery Object - These properties are associated with the global jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/category/properties/global-jquery-object-properties/
[10:15:30] <dabear> and I work with a lot of customers that really DOES NOT KNOW ctrl+f exists
[10:15:41] <juha_> falieson: i would say that if you want to impress them, build your cv to look and behave like the facebook timeline?
[10:15:42] <dabear> seriously, there's many of them
[10:15:47] <juha_> i think it's pretty cool
[10:15:58] <Hopsy> hmm, maybe it is not handy to use globals for me
[10:16:00] <falieson> juha_: I really like it too, but I think it'd be a bit too complicated for a resume
[10:16:03] <falieson> juha: http://florianmettetal.com/resume/
[10:16:16] <juha_> falieson: it's only complicated if you make it complicated
[10:16:19] <Hopsy> I have a question
[10:16:28] <Hopsy> I have those two rows
[10:16:32] <Hopsy> var name = $(this).parent().parent().find('dt').html().toString();
[10:16:37] <Hopsy> and
[10:16:40] <Hopsy> setTimeout( console.log(name) function(name){ console.log(name); },1000);
[10:16:53] <Hopsy> my console.log get's some weird numbers
[10:17:30] <Hopsy> isnt that weird =o
[10:17:37] <Jayflux> Why have .success and .error changed to .done and .fail?
[10:17:42] <juha_> falieson: you better hope that no facebook employees are on this channel and have a look at that resume :P
[10:18:53] <Hopsy> oops I meant: setTimeout(function(name){ console.log(name); },1000);
[10:19:59] <falieson> juha_: hahaha, yeah I suppose so
[10:20:09] <falieson> juha_: its about 1-days worth of work
[10:20:20] <falieson> juha_: and still ugly as shit
[10:20:27] <falieson> juha_: but I'm not going for a dev role
[10:21:19] <juha_> falieson: yeah, i'm sure you'll get it to look awesome! hopefully you'll get the job
[10:22:16] <falieson> juha_: thank you for the encourgaement, anyways - its usually hidden behind a .htaccess. I just wanted you to see I was already going down the facebook theme road
[10:22:17] <falieson> =)
[10:22:28] <falieson> started the design here before I added the timeline view of fbook
[10:23:28] <juha_> falieson: hae you seen the ctrl-f implementation in google docs?
[10:24:01] <falieson> no
[10:25:27] <falieson> juha_: now i have
[10:25:33] <falieson> juha_: that's pretty slick
[10:25:44] <juha_> falieson: yeah, i was just googling screenshots of it
[10:25:54] <falieson> i just opened up a google doc and took a look
[10:25:55] <falieson> =_)
[10:25:59] <juha_> =)
[10:26:27] <juha_> falieson: i think that sort functionality could be ok, but if it would do something else than the user expects, it would be bad
[10:26:52] <falieson> dabear: juha_: re: put your resume on LinkedIn http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-27-2011/indecision-2012---meet-the-prez
[10:28:33] <juha_> :P
[10:31:13] <falieson> juha_:  :-)
[10:32:06] <juha_> http://mashable.com/2011/10/09/facebook-timeline-designs/
[10:32:50] <falieson> haha, that's really cool
[10:34:22] <falieson> switching to the timeline view would require a lot of reworking
[10:34:38] <falieson> and I'm trying to just get it done today (I have some php to implement for the recommendations areA)
[10:34:59] <falieson> I suppose if I have extra time I could rework it fo the tiemline view but I doubt I will today... I'm not a good coder
[10:35:16] <falieson> I spent an hour yesterday just trying to get a few blocks of text to look good next to an image
[10:35:16] <falieson> =(
[10:35:27] <juha_> :P
[10:35:48] <juha_> you should just consentrate on your main talents and build the cv around them
[10:35:50] <juha_> or something
[10:36:40] <falieson> http://themeforest.net/item/clean-cv-resume-html-template-4-bonuses/full_screen_preview/82474?ref=NetPremium&clickthrough_id=33384218&redirect_back=true&ref=NetPremium I just don't want to do something boring like this
[10:36:53] <falieson> http://haganblount.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/infographic.jpg this one is really cool... but way too busy for my likes
[10:37:06] <falieson> and they are still both the paper look
[10:37:33] <juha_> the latter one has too much stuff on it
[10:37:35] <juha_> way too much
[10:37:42] <falieson> juha_: agreed
[10:37:50] <juha_> first one is lot more clear
[10:39:44] <juha_> vizualize.me will do wonders with your linkedin data
[10:39:47] <juha_> i like it
[10:42:39] <Daljo> Anyone have a suggestion on how I can check an attribute of something just before a .load() actually fills in the div?  Checking it before I run the .load() seems to be inconsistent due to latency and ping rates.
[10:43:17] <e-anima> as always ie ...http://pastebin.com/D4RwmTZf any ideas why thos does not work oin any IE 6-10
[10:43:37] <falieson> juha_: thanks, i'm gonna do this. might not as my primary but definitely going to play with it
[10:44:48] <e-anima> ah im so stupid console.log ... *g*
[10:45:17] <juha_> falieson: drop me a line on twitter or by email and let me know how it went ;)
[10:46:21] <falieson> what's your twit?
[10:48:08] <juha_> juha_tauriainen
[10:48:36] <falieson> there
[10:49:04] <falieson> I'll blog about the resume when its all done, and my blog is reposted to my tweet feed
[10:49:44] <juha_> cool
[10:53:49] <diverdude> Hello, How can i set the selected value of the autocomplete plugin?
[10:56:47] <diverdude> anyone?
[10:58:23] <juha_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2749721/how-do-set-a-default-value-with-jquery-autocomplete-combobox
[10:58:28] <juha_> first result from google
[10:58:34] <juha_> that'll be $10, thank you
[11:01:43] <diverdude> juha_, i found that one myself....i dont use combobox
[11:02:24] <rgr> http://pastebin.com/WbP8tAvZ : is there anything obviously wrong here - fade out when the mouse stops hovering. But its not working. Can I not rely on the mouseout event being fired?
[11:04:40] <dogarrhea2_> how do I get the parent of a ui objct?
[11:04:47] <dogarrhea2_> .parent() is not supported
[11:05:37] <juha_> why not?
[11:06:17] <dogarrhea2_> i don't know.
[11:06:23] <dogarrhea2_> ui.parent() just gives an error
[11:06:46] <juha_> what sort of error? is ui jquery object?
[11:07:13] <dogarrhea2_> ui is a jquery ui thing
[11:07:36] <dogarrhea2_> ok i just used $(this).parent()
[11:07:41] <dabear> ui.element or something?
[11:07:44] <dogarrhea2_> from the event handler in stop.
[11:09:13] <dabear> ?paste@  dogarrhea2_
[11:09:14] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:10:03] <dogarrhea2_> eh it's solved dabear: stop: function(event, ui){alert($(this).parent().attr("id"));}
[11:10:27] <dabear> ahok
[11:10:37] <dabear> thought you wanted the related element, but ok
[11:11:16] <dogarrhea2_> i added a slider to some div and just wanted the parent's id
[11:11:40] <Dreamstar> Hello, I want to update a div when something happens, for example, I count members from my database and when someone signs up the number grows with one. I want to update this number without have to refresh the whole page, any ideas?
[11:13:28] <diverdude> juha_, yes ui jquery autocomplete on a text input field
[11:19:03] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:19:14] <lenswipe> is it possible to trigger the :hover state of an element with jquery?
[11:19:37] <diverdude> what i want to is to show the full list focused on the selected value, which is marked with blue. So for example calling search on the jquery ui autocomplete  plugin is not an option
[11:20:25] <Woet> lenswipe: $("#element").hover(function(){ }); ?
[11:20:43] <lenswipe> Woet, thats just the same as mouseover() isnt it?
[11:20:47] <Woet> no
[11:20:51] <lenswipe> oh?
[11:20:54] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[11:20:59] <lenswipe> i want to trigger the css :hover state
[11:21:01] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[11:21:05] <hugifrb> I use a jquery dialog to help the user to select an object from a list. I can open the dialog and render the view inside the dialog. But I don't know how to return the selected object id the  form in the background.
[11:21:16] <Woet> lenswipe: oh, i see what you mean
[11:21:22] <hugifrb> maybe you should know that I use ruby on rails on the server
[11:21:43] <Dreamstar> Hello, I want to update a div when something happens, for example, I count members from my database and when someone signs up the number grows with one. I want to update this number without have to refresh the whole page, any ideas?
[11:21:55] <lenswipe> Woet, ive written styles for :hover on my li a parent of a dropdown and i want the :hover to be active while i hover on the dropdown item but id rather not have to write another stylesheet rule
[11:22:01] <Woet> Dreamstar: ajax.
[11:22:14] <monstaRtruck> yoyoyo
[11:22:24] <Dreamstar> Woet: Isn't it possible with jQuery?
[11:22:30] <eighty4> lenswipe: don't think you can do that. just add a .hover class instead
[11:22:31] <monstaRtruck> .each will work on an array i will make right
[11:22:47] <eighty4> Dreamstar: query would use ajax for that
[11:22:51] <Woet> Dreamstar: jQuery has ajax functions.
[11:23:04] <Dreamstar> Well yeah
[11:23:07] <lenswipe> eighty4, :( ok
[11:23:31] <eighty4> lenswipe: I might be wrong. But I've at least never seen it done.
[11:23:37] <lenswipe> ok
[11:24:27] <Woet> lenswipe: it's possible, i'm trying to remember
[11:25:26] <lenswipe> ok :)
[11:25:33] <lenswipe> Woet, its ok i have it working another way
[11:26:43] <eighty4> Woet: I'm interesting in seeing a solution to it.
[11:27:08] <Woet> hm, you cant trigger pseudo selectors
[11:27:20] <Woet> so yea, it would have to be .hover
[11:27:32] <eighty4> right, what I was thinking
[11:27:43] <eighty4> from what I remember it's a security thing
[11:28:00] <eighty4> Dreamstar: have a look at $.ajax
[11:28:15] <monstaRtruck> yeya it werks
[11:28:27] <Dreamstar> eighty4: I have like this atm, https://pastee.org/ssbgy
[11:28:38] <Dreamstar> It works, but it is the most optional?
[11:28:49] <monstaRtruck> array of objects lol
[11:28:56] <monstaRtruck> [{},{},{}]
[11:30:14] <eighty4> Dreamstar: I wouldn't have written it in that way but yeah. That's basically how you do it
[11:30:31] <Dreamstar> Alright
[11:31:23] <Dreamstar> Thanks then :)
[11:36:27] <hugifrb> Hi I need to update my view from a rails action with jquery. How can I call or pass something from the action to a jquery method?
[11:38:43] <DNX> hi guys, how to select a neighbour "input.myclass" of $(this) placed on the same level(same td)?
[11:39:02] <DNX> siblings() ?
[11:39:25] <dabear> hugifrb: you make jquery request that action through ajax, then the action class should return either html,xml, json or text, and then you interpret the result from jquery and do whatever you want
[11:39:34] <DNX> or through "parent" element?
[11:40:01] <Dreamstar> eighty4: I have one more question, now the div refresh all the time non stop, maybe it could just refresh when something happens
[11:40:15] <hugifrb> ok sounds easy ... do you know a tutorial for this?
[11:40:39] <dabear> DNX: $(this).parent().find("input.myclass").not(this)
[11:41:03] <dabear> DNX: or if you know they are siblings, you can just use $(this).siblings()
[11:41:48] <rgr> if I have multiple ready functions (one per js file) how do I invoke them all from jquery when I need the page reparsed by jquery?
[11:42:39] <DNX> ok, thank you dabear
[11:44:37] <eighty4> Dreamstar: just check the old value against the new value and just update it when it's new
[11:44:43] <ravenzz> rgr what do you mean with reparsed?
[11:45:05] <rgr> you cant figure it out? Dont worry. I found the solution.
[11:48:32] <eighty4> rgr: If you're doing what I think you're doing you're doing it wrong. You should be calling functions in ready() so when you need it "reparsed" just call the functions
[11:48:41] <eighty4> but I might be wrong at what you're doing
[11:48:54] <rgr> I am doing that now.
[11:49:01] <rgr> (functions)
[11:49:17] <DUAL_DETROIT_> Why can't I have jquery plugins in my jquery plugins?
[11:49:24] <rgr> but theoretically multiple reday functions are fine too and there should be a way of invoking them all after updating the dom
[11:49:40] <DUAL_DETROIT_> I am talking about jQuery.fn.madonnaplugin
[11:49:45] <DUAL_DETROIT_> kloeri: Apologies.
[11:50:04] <DUAL_DETROIT_> (Or whatever plugin)
[11:51:43] <seankoole> Oi
[11:52:07] <seankoole> Can someone type a backtick?
[11:52:25] <DUAL_DETROIT_> `
[11:52:49] <DUAL_DETROIT_> seankoole: Down under thunder blunder!!!
[11:58:14] <falieson> juha_: sent you a pm
[12:00:48] <DUAL_DETROIT_> So is it okay to write meta jquery plugins that use jquery plugins I've written?

[12:53:02] <visua> hello o/
[12:55:07] <visua> This may be more of a css issue, but i'm trying to stack 100% height/width divs, and use scrollTo, but i'm having some problems. Anyone solved this?
[13:00:34] <ryanharris> Hello, please can someone help me with a simple jquery and json problem?
[13:01:36] <visua> ryanharris: Possibly, whats the problem?
[13:02:34] <ryanharris> well, I have a fairly simple calendar interface, where you click on the query ui date picker and it shows events for that date, but unfortunately, I'm not quite sure how to make it show more than one event?
[13:03:08] <visua> ryanharris: ah sorry, I haven't that much experience with query ui :\
[13:03:17] <visua> bit of a newb :\
[13:03:44] <ryanharris> ok, but actually, this part, looking at the code, has nothing to do with query ui
[13:03:59] <ryanharris> just connecting and displaying stuff with json?
[13:04:13] <visua> ohh i see
[13:04:40] <visua> are the events appended into the dom?
[13:06:01] <ryanharris> think so
[13:06:20] <ryanharris> I'd prefer to talk about this in a separate chat, if that's ok?
[13:06:54] <visua> I don't really have much jQuery experience, tbh. I'm a designer not really a developer :\
[13:07:02] <visua> I mainly use it for effects
[13:07:28] <ryanharris> ok, never mind then, but thanks for your help anyway!
[13:07:48] <visua> You might get more help just asking here in general from more knowledgable people
[13:14:13] <ryanharris> ok, I think I might have sorted it now, anyway!
[13:17:06] * dross yawns
[13:46:09] <molavy> hi
[13:46:59] <molavy> i have some element with sorted id's
[13:47:24] <molavy> they are row's something like 1,4,6,12,87
[13:47:57] <molavy> i have row with id like 9
[13:48:28] <molavy> i want put it into table after 6 and before 12
[13:49:32] <molavy> how can get next bigger than id according row id that i have
[13:49:33] <molavy> ?
[13:50:20] <molavy> any idea?
[13:53:54] <molavy> there is no idea?
[13:57:36] <nospeq> hinbody, i have a problem with getJSON. i have some scripts in window.onload, and also a currency variable with default calue 'GBP'. in the middle i do a console.log(currency) and i see GBP. with getJSON i load new value (EUR), but even if i do this function before console.log, i still have a GBP value. if i put console.log in the middle of getJSON function, console.log with correct value(EUR) is showed at the last. why?
[14:12:19] <ASnyder> Say I create an object inline from data, then add it to some dom element, then set events, and then store that object in a non-dom location. Is there some reason that my events stop working after showing the object a second time from the object store?
[14:12:48] <ASnyder> Are they not the same object? Don't quite understand why events would just stop working on an object. Or why I would need to re-set the events.
[14:12:49] <nospeq> i think i found a solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1739800/variables-set-during-getjson-function-only-accessible-within-function
[14:21:31] <cakehero> Anyone have an idea how to get this jQuery UI Slider to "attach" itself off center: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqafo_m7Qls
[14:21:44] <cakehero> You can see that when I drag to the left it stops too short, and when I drag to the right it goes too far
[14:24:51] <Zerks> got a strange issue here going on that I'm not quite sure how to solve
[14:25:39] <Zerks> I recently updated jquery to the latest on our site, and a handful of users have started having issues with some sections in firefox (sections that inject html and javascript into the dom after an ajax request; the injected javascript function winds up not being defined)
[14:25:48] <Zerks> and they get this error in the console: xplSearch.engine is undefined
[14:25:49] <Zerks> chrome://searchshield/content/overlay.js Line:968
[14:26:06] <Zerks> however, it doesn't affect everyone, I can't reproduce it myself, and they're on the latest firefox too.. so not sure what's going on
[14:27:41] <Zerks> I doubt there's many people that can help me with this problem but if anyone here knows where to start, I'd appreciate it :(
[14:28:36] <cakehero> Zerks yeah I don't know
[14:28:53] <cakehero> Zerks I might add some logging to get more information, confirm the code is actually running that defines the function
[14:29:03] <cakehero> Zerks or google "Firefox dynamically add javascript"
[14:40:23] <aghouseh> oy anyone run into the IE8 "unexpected call to method or property access" bug? im using modernizr and it still horks on the 'appendChild' in jquery
[14:56:07] <Zerks> strange. for jqueryui tabs, I have the dataType (in the tabs ajaxOptions) set to 'html' yet jquery still tries to run parseJSON on the response first
[15:13:06] <antihero> hey
[15:13:11] <antihero> how do I go about selecting within a scope
[15:13:47] <antihero> so say I have a button in a div, which is then clicked, and I need to get a textarea that's also in a div
[15:14:01] <antihero> how do I select ('textarea') within $(this).parent() ?
[15:16:07] <raven_> ?find @ antihero
[15:16:08] <bot-t> antihero, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/

[15:33:09] <Spadeski> Anyone wanna help me on this any animation that i use inside loaded divss from ajax dont work ?
[16:17:56] <DetroitDogs> Yo yo yo, what up dawgs. Detroit Dawgs be in da house.
[16:20:39] <DetroitDogs> I want to find the element at a certain offset.
[16:22:55] <BinaryKitten> DetroitDogs can you define what you mean by offset?
[16:22:58] <Zxurian> is ther a way to replace text within the DOM without destroying any elements?
[16:23:06] <codeshah> hey guys, when I do a jquery.ajax ... the url has a %22 or quotation in it... but it sends a \" instead
[16:23:13] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: I think I want  document.elementFromPoint()
[16:23:50] <BinaryKitten> and how are you getting that point?
[16:24:14] <codeshah> hey guys, when I do a jquery.ajax with url: .. and the url has a quotation mark in it, that quotation is passed with a escape in front how do I prevent that?
[16:24:49] <coldhead> TALK AT YOU LATER, CODESHAH
[16:26:50] <BinaryKitten> DetroitDogs >> how are you getting the point that you will pass to the elementFromPoint?
[16:27:11] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: mouseup event :p
[16:27:24] <juha_> coldhead: hey you!
[16:27:27] <BinaryKitten> you know that the event object has a targetnode
[16:27:42] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Yeah, I am looking at that now
[16:27:54] <BinaryKitten> :)
[16:28:05] <DetroitDogs> Which do you think is more reliable cross-browser, event.target or  document.elementFromPoint(?
[16:28:14] <BinaryKitten> event.target
[16:28:54] <DetroitDogs> :o
[16:29:03] <DetroitDogs> You're probably right :-\
[16:31:42] <BinaryKitten> DetroitDogs also there is little point doing a dom search for an item that you have readily access to
[16:31:51] <DetroitDogs> right
[16:32:09] <BinaryKitten> welcome back codeshah
[16:32:45] <codeshah> hey guys when I do a jquery.ajax and the url was previously created as a variable and has a quotation in it... the quotation is passed with an escape in front. Can I avoid that? I tried putting %22 as well
[16:32:59] <BinaryKitten> where is it getting the escape?
[16:33:00] <codeshah> i.e. http://bla.com/asdf.php?a="blasdf"
[16:33:03] <coldhead> just don't put quotations in your URLs
[16:33:10] <coldhead> case closed
[16:33:26] <juha_> cloased
[16:33:30] <codeshah> coldhead: would love to but this site I am passing params to wants a quotation around one param :( its dumb
[16:33:37] <codeshah> i can always ask them to not ask for that
[16:33:47] <coldhead> that would be my approach
[16:33:53] <coldhead> make it someone else's problem
[16:33:54] <codeshah> coldhead: k thx
[16:34:03] <coldhead> then pour yourself a manhattan
[16:34:13] <juha_> add_fuckin_slashes
[16:34:15] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Actually, I have no choice. Because there is an element under the mouse (following the cursor), event.target will be set to that. I will have to destroy that element on mouseup, then use  document.elementFromPoint()
[16:34:35] <codeshah> juha_: ?
[16:34:45] <BinaryKitten> DetroitDogs drag/drop?
[16:35:47] <BinaryKitten> if so would recommend offsetting the moving item
[16:36:12] <juha_> codeshah: i meant encode the url, forget about adding slashes
[16:36:19] <juha_> i'm drunk and so on
[16:36:34] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Yeah, drag/drop. And offsetting isn't an option due to aesthetic need.
[16:36:41] <DetroitDogs> And we are also using touchstart/touchend
[16:36:53] <DetroitDogs> Where the item will be under their finger
[16:37:01] <BinaryKitten> ah
[16:37:28] <BinaryKitten> the drag move happens after cursor move right?
[16:37:38] <BinaryKitten> i mean you update the position via mousemove?
[16:39:13] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Yeah
[16:39:27] <BinaryKitten> DetroitDogs store the last item
[16:39:36] <DetroitDogs> I could have used ondragenter/ondrop events, but it doesn't seem to work well on the iPad
[16:39:37] <BinaryKitten> eg from teh mousemove store the event.target
[16:39:42] <BinaryKitten> then on mouseup use that
[16:39:55] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Well, I know what is being moved. But I don't know what is being "dropped on"
[16:40:19] <BinaryKitten> dropped on would be the last item you've moved the item over
[16:41:00] <BinaryKitten> you can't drop it on something if you don't move over it right?
[16:41:12] <DetroitDogs> BinaryKitten: Right, I gotcha.
[16:41:51] <DetroitDogs> That's a good idea if I decide to avoid document.elementFromPoint()
[16:43:31] <Zxurian> so is there a way to replace text directly into a childNode?
[16:43:38] <BinaryKitten> yes
[16:43:49] <Zxurian> what would the proper syntax be?
[16:43:54] <BinaryKitten> depends
[16:43:58] <BinaryKitten> what's the child node?
[16:44:10] <Zxurian> $("#google_translate_element div")[0].childNodes[1]
[16:44:31] <Zxurian> it's a text node, and I just want to remove the text from that node specifically
[16:44:45] <BinaryKitten> ah
[16:44:48] <BinaryKitten> right
[16:44:58] <BinaryKitten> are there any other nodes in the div?
[16:45:03] <Zxurian> yes
[16:45:09] <Zxurian> that can't be touched
[16:45:45] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin the html div and example content
[16:47:11] <cakehero> How do I add an instance variable to a jQuery plugin?
[16:47:20] <Zxurian> BK: http://pastebin.com/BexhQKsC
[16:47:45] <Zxurian> need to isolate and replace "&nbsp&nbsp;Powered by" text node
[16:47:59] <Zxurian> i know how to isolate it, just not how to replace the text
[16:48:42] <cakehero> Zxurian http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp
[16:48:53] <tbranyen> anyone know of a good tag plugin?
[16:48:53] <Zxurian> that doesn't work
[16:49:02] <tbranyen> i remember seeing a few not too long ago that looked good
[16:49:09] <tbranyen> for creating tags
[16:49:11] <tbranyen> in a form
[16:49:13] <BinaryKitten> sorry my laptop seems to not playing fair
[16:49:16] <Zxurian> cakehero: that function returns the replaced string, it doesn't actually replace the text within the ndoe
[16:49:31] <cakehero> Zxurian $( nodeSelector ).html( newText );
[16:49:42] <BinaryKitten> cakehero that replacs everey thing
[16:49:49] <Zxurian> which then destroys the original elements within the dom, which i also can't do
[16:49:54] <cakehero> BinaryKitten it does, which is why your new text should contain everything + the replacements
[16:49:59] <Zxurian> BK: thank you, it sounds like you know the problem i'm running into
[16:50:07] <cakehero> Zxurian ahhh there are other elements in there
[16:50:18] <BinaryKitten> Zxurian yes. Looking into the best method
[16:50:29] <BinaryKitten> as soon as this blasted method
[16:50:39] <cakehero> Zxurian I see your bin
[16:53:22] <cakehero> Zxurian you can still do it that way if you want.
[16:54:12] <cakehero> var content = $( selector ).html(); content.replace(/yourReplacement/, 'stuff'); $( selector ).html( content );
[16:54:15] <cakehero> Zxurian that works
[16:54:24] <cakehero> Zxurian since the elements aren't removed from "content"
[16:54:28] <Zxurian> no, I can't, as the html() method doesn't apply when selecting the text node directly
[16:54:41] <cakehero> Zxurian I just tested it
[16:54:51] <cakehero> Zxurian selected the parent of the text node
[16:55:25] <Zxurian> your missing the point. using the html() method replaces ALL dom elements within, if their semantally identical, the original event handlers attached to the original items are then destroyed
[16:55:30] <cakehero> var content = $( '.skiptranslate.goog-te-gadget').html(); content.repace(/stuff/, replacement); $('.skiptranslate.goog-te-gadget').html(content);
[16:55:39] <cakehero> Zxurian yeah that's true
[16:55:48] <cakehero> Zxurian do you have event handlers attached?
[16:56:01] <Zxurian> yes. hence my original point that I can't touch the other dom elements within the selector
[16:56:23] <cakehero> k
[16:56:27] * BinaryKitten is going to try a few things
[16:56:41] * Zxurian waiting for BK's stroke of genius
[16:57:31] <cakehero> Zxurian and you can't wrap it in a span?
[16:57:41] <Zxurian> no
[17:02:21] <kul> how to call a function just once after all other elements and scripts of the page loads ?
[17:02:49] <tbranyen> jQuery(function() { myFunc(); });
[17:04:34] <kul> tbranyen its not working :(
[17:04:58] <thekirbylover> kul: Try $(myFunc) where myFunc is the name of the function you want to run
[17:05:06] <tbranyen> thekirbylover: that is literally identical
[17:05:13] <tbranyen> except for not wrapping in another function
[17:05:26] <tbranyen> kul: if its not working you're doing something wrong
[17:05:29] <tbranyen> check your console for errors
[17:05:39] <kul> no errors in console
[17:05:43] <kul> I checked that
[17:06:51] <patbam> hi... i'm futzing about with playing a bunch of clips from an <audio> -- i should be looking at .queue, yes?
[17:06:51] <kul> http://glintt.in/Flickr/index2.html <-- link on thing I'm working on.
[17:07:20] <patbam> kul: that's pretty :)
[17:07:22] <kul> I want to call bigimg() after everything else loads and that too just 1ce
[17:07:52] <kul> Thanks patbam :)
[17:08:33] <thekirbylover> patbam: What I do is load multiple audio tags at once, autoplay the first one, then $("audio").bind("ended",function(){ $(this).next("audio")[0].play(); });
[17:09:18] <patbam> thekirbylover: hmm, so you just have one media file and a separate <audio> for each clip?
[17:10:05] <kul> tbranyen: ?
[17:10:16] <thekirbylover> patbam: Something like this: <audio src="song1.mp3" autoplay preload></audio><audio src="song2.mp3" preload></audio>
[17:10:21] <BinaryKitten> Zxurian  http://jsfiddle.net/8Aqxw/
[17:11:06] <thekirbylover> patbam: Just keep adding as many audio tags as you need and run the javascript I wrote above
[17:11:11] <patbam> thekirbylover: oh i see. but this is actually my problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7701346/ so i'm constrained to use a single audio file
[17:12:19] <thekirbylover> patbam: Oh, I see.
[17:13:15] <thekirbylover> patbam: You can change $("audio")[0].currentTime to a time in milliseconds when you want to play a part of the sound
[17:13:27] <BinaryKitten> Zxurian ?
[17:13:50] <patbam> thekirbylover: yeah... i have managed to play a single clip, the problem is queueing them
[17:14:02] <patbam> thekirbylover: also, queueing is incredibly hard to spell :)
[17:14:32] <thekirbylover> patbam: You'll then need to work out how long the sound goes for, do a pause(), skip to next time, play() and repeat
[17:15:49] <patbam> thekirbylover: i see. it just seems like this is what $.queue is for -- not running one function till another is over
[17:16:43] <thekirbylover> patbam: Yes, but I'm not sure how we would use that with audio
[17:17:27] <patbam> thekirbylover: hmm yeah, seems tricky. thanks, i'll look around a bit more
[17:17:37] <monmon3> I made a little cat animation using canvas, on mouseover it's eyes get beady, and i want it to onmouseout make the eyes get big again
[17:17:40] <monmon3> http://wheatpondkingfir.com/cat.html
[17:17:50] <monmon3> but i cant figure out the right way to do it
[17:17:51] <thekirbylover> patbam: I think you can do a ‚Äúreturn $.fn.sleep(1000)‚Äù to pause for 1000ms
[17:18:12] <monmon3> if i call the opposite of that function basically onmouseout, it goes crazy because the beady() function is still trying to make the eyes small
[17:18:40] <patbam> thekirbylover: hmm, that's interesting. i saw something called "$.delay" too, which seems similar
[17:19:02] <monmon3> is there a better way to do this?  i feel like im missing something obvious
[17:19:19] <patbam> thekirbylover: you know what would make this really easy, would be if the .play method in the js api for <audio> objects would take [start, stop] arguments
[17:19:26] <BinaryKitten> delay doesn't pause between thingss unless they are queued
[17:19:26] <thekirbylover> patbam: I'll have a look at the jquery docs
[17:19:47] <thekirbylover> patbam: Yeah, that'd be really good
[17:20:04] <Zxurian> reviewing it now BK
[17:20:25] <Zxurian> hm... I saw that in my google searches
[17:20:31] <patbam> thekirbylover: i wonder how such things are decided
[17:20:38] <Zxurian> was hoping there was a way to do it without traversing through each node
[17:21:05] <thekirbylover> patbam: Found it: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[17:21:11] <BinaryKitten> in theory you're not exactly traversing every node any more than any other code would
[17:21:40] <thekirbylover> patbam: So try something like $("audio")[0].play();return $.fn.delay(2000);
[17:22:24] <BinaryKitten> thekirbylover that won't work
[17:22:34] <BinaryKitten> $.fn.delay is not meant to work like that
[17:22:44] <BinaryKitten> it's used to delay between queued items
[17:23:02] <thekirbylover> BinaryKitten: Hm, ok.
[17:23:41] <thekirbylover> BinaryKitten: I would've thought because we're using the jquery queue, it would work.
[17:24:10] <BinaryKitten> where are you using that?
[17:24:16] <BinaryKitten> sorry, might have missed soemthing
[17:25:05] <patbam> thekirbylover: thanks, trying it
[17:25:29] <monmon3> If I call a function on mouseover, do i have to do anything to get it to stop being called on mouseout?
[17:26:01] <BinaryKitten> unbind monmon3
[17:26:27] <BinaryKitten> thekirbylover ... can you show me the code that uses queue?
[17:26:54] <thekirbylover> BinaryKitten: Just a minute
[17:27:38] <monmon3> BinaryKitten: sorry, i should have been more clear.  not using jquery, just javascript, so it's like <input onmouseover="small()" onmouseout="big()">
[17:27:54] <monmon3> small() and big() are both functions that manipulate canvas
[17:28:02] <BinaryKitten> that's not js that's html
[17:28:32] <monmon3> err right, html to call two javascript functions, small() and big()
[17:28:40] <BinaryKitten> html auto binds
[17:28:47] <BinaryKitten> try unbind anyway
[17:29:08] <monmon3> BinaryKitten: OK, thanks!
[17:29:10] <monmon3> ill give it a try
[17:31:06] <thekirbylover> BinaryKitten: Here's patbam's code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7701346/ and I'm telling him to use ‚Äúreturn $.fn.delay(1000)‚Äù at the end of a queue function
[17:32:05] <kul> can any1 help me with my query ?
[17:32:19] <kul> I want to load a function after everything else on page loads.
[17:32:40] <kul> I want load 1 function last ! and that function must be loaded just 1ce
[17:33:19] <BinaryKitten> thekirbylover
[17:33:29] <BinaryKitten> ah i see
[17:33:40] <BinaryKitten> don't return delay
[17:33:44] <BinaryKitten> call it after
[17:33:46] <BinaryKitten> in chain
[17:34:11] <thekirbylover> BinaryKitten: Ok, we'll try that
[17:36:00] <BinaryKitten> eg item.queue(function() { this.play(); }).delay('1000')
[17:36:01] <aniasis|karega> Is there any point in creating a javascript 'object' if it is only instantiated once?
[17:36:21] <BinaryKitten> instantiated
[17:36:43] <BinaryKitten> or used?
[17:36:45] <thekirbylover> patbam: Try queue(function(){ $("audio")[0].play(); }).delay(1000).queue(function(){ $("audio")[0].pause(); /*etc...*/ });
[17:36:53] <aniasis|karega> instantiated
[17:37:02] <BinaryKitten> thekirbylover :)
[17:37:20] <JohnnyDavidson> Can anyone help me with canvas?
[17:37:32] <JohnnyDavidson> I'm having trouble clearing a stroke
[17:37:44] * BinaryKitten decides it's time to sleep
[17:38:14] <patbam> thekirbylover: the problem there is that it ends up being super nested
[17:38:36] <patbam> er, wait no it doesn't i guess
[17:38:44] <monmon3> BinaryKitten: hmm, unbinding didnt seem to work.. it made the eye animation spazz out even more >_<
[17:39:04] <monmon3> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/xyW4y/ here's the relevant code with the html and css removed, and here's the actual page: http://wheatpondkingfir.com/cat.html
[17:39:05] <monmon3> if that helps
[17:39:15] <BinaryKitten> sorry monmon3
[17:39:32] <BinaryKitten> any chance you can remove the "on" stuff from the html
[17:39:44] <BinaryKitten> and create a domReady binding?
[17:39:54] <BinaryKitten> its now (minus lag) 01:39 am and sleepy
[17:40:07] <JohnnyDavidson> Can anyone help?
[17:40:50] <monmon3> BinaryKitten: hmm.. don't think that's it but i'll try.  thanks!
[17:42:39] <BinaryKitten> monmon3 by domready binding i mean in the ready function, use the mouseover/mouseout bind etc..
[17:42:44] * BinaryKitten is too sleepy to think
[17:42:46] <BinaryKitten> gnight
[17:57:49] <patbam> i wonder if i could write a method like Audio.prototype.playClip(start,stop)
[18:09:35] <Zxurian> BK: thanks for that bit of code, that works awesome
[18:10:08] <Chani> so... I'm working on this neural net demo thing, and the display is going to have to have a lot of grids of little squares that change colour.  would I be crazy to try and do that with lots of html tables? should I use <canvas> or something?
[18:48:42] <youtnodknoem> hello everyone
[18:48:55] <youtnodknoem> I
[18:49:12] <youtnodknoem> I"m trying to bind onclick handlers to my divs
[18:49:15] <youtnodknoem> inside a forloop
[18:49:32] <youtnodknoem> so, for each div append foo(x) where x changes per each iteration
[18:49:43] <Zerks> go on
[18:49:45] <youtnodknoem> but for some reason onclick is only being bound to the LAST div in the cycle
[18:49:59] <Zerks> ?paste
[18:49:59] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:50:46] <youtnodknoem> sure
[18:50:47] <youtnodknoem> http://jsfiddle.net/dTADU/
[18:51:20] <youtnodknoem> i tried .click()
[18:51:32] <youtnodknoem> .bind() and .live()
[18:51:52] <youtnodknoem> everything seems to return the same thing..it only binds the very last jQuery selector
[18:53:06] <Zerks> is it that the click event is only bound to the last div, or that each div has basically the same click event (they all toggle the last tag instead of their own tag_id)
[18:53:25] <youtnodknoem> sorry yes
[18:53:34] <youtnodknoem> the second
[18:53:43] <youtnodknoem> Each div does the same thing, which is toggle the last div on/off
[18:54:51] <Zerks> i feel like I've had this happen to myself already‚Ä¶ and i think it was because of resetting those vars within the loop, inside the same scope, so each bound function is affected. if what I'm saying isn't wrong, I can't remember the proper way to do it, but I may have done it on one of my sites and I will check
[18:55:56] <youtnodknoem> Zerks -- interesting! I thought resetting the variable each time would just create a new copy and leave the old one well enough alone
[18:56:14] <youtnodknoem> Cool thanks -- really appreciate it
[18:57:59] <Zerks> youtnodknoem:  http://jsfiddle.net/dTADU/1/
[18:58:04] <Zerks> two options you could switch to instead
[18:58:11] <Zerks> less code to just use the ID I guess
[18:58:20] <Zerks> err wait
[18:58:31] <Zerks> since the ID already has "tag_" in it, don't need that part in the toggleTag call
[18:59:29] <Zerks> ‚Ä¶.and .data('tag' should be tag_id since that's what I named it, whoops
[19:00:05] <Zerks> http://jsfiddle.net/dTADU/2/  fixed
[19:03:00] <juha_> this is a way to start the week, can't get no sleep, going to the office to sleep for couple of hours.. :P
[19:03:56] <Zerks> my office is my home, at least
[19:04:24] <youtnodknoem2> @Zerks
[19:04:33] <youtnodknoem2> thanks that worked like a charm
[19:04:38] <Zerks> great :)
[19:04:51] <youtnodknoem2> What does that data function do?
[19:05:19] <Zerks> stores a piece of data with the element. can store strings, booleans, json, etc
[19:05:46] <youtnodknoem2> oh awesome!
[19:05:52] <Zerks> if you're using html5, you can have elements start out with data, too, using data-name attributes. and jquery will have their values when you do .data('name')
[19:05:54] <Zerks> ?data
[19:05:55] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:05:59] <youtnodknoem2> so was it because the event handler was using the freshest variable each time?
[19:06:21] <youtnodknoem2> whew
[19:06:28] <youtnodknoem2> THat look way longer than it should have.
[19:06:33] <Zerks> it was using the variable from that scope when the function was initiated, which means the variable always had the last value given to it, I guess
[19:06:51] <Zerks> I don't remember the proper way of dealing with that issue but what I gave you is a good replacement
[19:08:46] <kborchers> youtnodknoem2: I haven't seen your HTML but .delegate should make the loop unnecessary http://jsfiddle.net/dTADU/4/
[19:10:57] <g_dubbz> hello
[19:11:58] <g_dubbz> can anyone help me with a .slideUp() question?
[19:12:22] <kborchers> .ask @ g_dubbz
[19:12:32] <tbranyen> ?ask @ g_dubbz
[19:12:32] <bot-t> g_dubbz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[19:12:39] <kborchers> stupid iPad
[19:12:40] <tbranyen> :3
[19:13:22] <g_dubbz> super! i wasn't sure if there was a way to check the state of a div
[19:13:29] <g_dubbz> whether it was up or down
[19:13:46] <g_dubbz> i know there's a .is() function, but i wouldn't know how to use it in this context
[19:14:53] <aniasis|karega> what is the fastest way to hide multiple elements at once.
[19:15:05] <Chani> ok... first off, if I have several arrays of arrays of data, can I get a bunch of table cells to display that data easily?
[19:15:17] <Chani> that seems like something sensible, so I expect so
[19:15:24] <kborchers> $("selector").hide();
[19:15:33] <Chani> then I just have to figure out how to show a pretty colour instead of raw data
[19:16:27] <aniasis|karega> kborchers, that isn't fast
[19:17:06] <Chani> where would I start with that.. some sort of selector thing that retuns all hte cells, I suppose...
[19:17:19] <Chani> actually, I should start by making a table. ;)
[19:17:42] <CmdrTallen> $("td").hide();
[19:19:55] <CmdrTallen> might be faster to use something more specific, ie $("#table_id td").hide();
[19:20:52] <kborchers> Which is exactly what I said ... aniasis|karega you're gonna need to be more specific about what u mean by fast
[19:33:33] <fructose> Is there a way to have jQuery report all the attributes of a given object?
[19:39:25] <fructose> And how would I write a selector to match a foo in <option>foo</option> and not match <option>foobar</option>?
[19:41:52] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hey, I have a code that sends ajax queries to a php file, it returns json results, there are different commands, they all work well
[19:42:09] <Nicolas_Leonida2> except that for one of them there are some weird characters before the JSON returned, it's probably BOM
[19:42:35] <Nicolas_Leonida2> Jquery doesn't ignore that BOM character it doesn't call my callback function
[19:44:11] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ]ÔøΩ?
[19:44:14] <Nicolas_Leonida2> that's it
[19:50:09] <_phoe6> Hello, I need help in interpreting this review comment and possible way to refactor this small snippet. http://jsfiddle.net/phoe6/hzcQg/ There are two check boxes and I need to allow only one of the them to be checked by the user and not both.
[19:53:06] <kborchers> _phoe6: So why would u not use radio buttons?
[20:02:43] <Spadeski> Can I get some help with jplayer ?
[20:35:11] <cypha> dabear, for helping me understand how to use ajax
[20:35:31] <Chani> I have a table with id="input", and I'm trying to select all the cells.. can someone tell me why this isn't working? $('#index td').css("border", "2px solid #a44");
[20:36:39] <Chani> n/m. typo. :P
[20:37:32] <Chani> ahh crap. I fixed the id and it still doesn't do anything!
[20:37:46] <Chani> what's the next silly mistake?
[20:37:53] <Spadeski> lol
[20:37:57] <Spadeski> Chani need some help ?
[20:38:15] <cypha> i have this script, and I can't tell why the value of "data" isn't going into #status http://paste.ofcode.org/b6NUZ6Zz2vy89kLMgQmuTW
[20:38:17] <Chani> got it! :)
[20:38:26] * Chani had tr, not td
[20:38:52] <Chani> although that means tr's can't have borders. hrm.
[20:39:48] <Chani> next problem: what I *actually* wanted to set was the bg color, but that wasn't working for me eralier, neither bgColor nor backgroundColor
[20:41:25] <cypha> i have this script, and I can't tell why the value of "data" isn't going into #status http://paste.ofcode.org/b6NUZ6Zz2vy89kLMgQmuTW (and here is a live link--> http://68.198.22.26:8000/ ) you can log in with xyz:xyz
[20:41:57] <Chani> oh... backgroundColor works now. o.0
[20:44:28] <Chani> now I need to select the Ith cell in the Jth row. how would I do that?
[20:46:37] <Chani> weird, backgroundColor works from code but not from <style>
[20:46:47] <mooKoo> is anyone here familiar with notepad++?
[20:48:38] <Chani> cypha: I can't figure that out either :(
[20:49:00] <coldhead> cypha: is console.log(data) working?
[20:49:07] <coldhead> inside that post callback?
[20:49:15] <coldhead> can you see the data in the log?
[20:49:36] <coldhead> if so, then try using 'some string' instead of data
[20:49:38] <cypha``> not sure what console.log is. but I can type "data" in the console, and I see the value Object {'username':xyz}
[20:49:44] <coldhead> to see if it's updating at all
[20:50:06] <coldhead> console.log causes data to be dumped in the firebug console
[20:50:10] <coldhead> or equivalent
[20:50:44] <coldhead> it is your debugging friend
[20:54:10] <cypha> coldhead, it seems to have erratic behavior
[20:54:13] <cypha> sometimes it doesn't work at all
[20:55:19] <coldhead> i can't take a look just now sorry
[20:55:27] <coldhead> console.log is my only top tip
[20:57:56] <cypha> kk
[21:10:44] <Spadeski> sup coldhea
[21:10:47] <Spadeski> coldhead
[21:11:33] <coldhead> hi Spadesy
[21:12:36] <Chani> is there an easy way to select a column from a table, or am I better off adding some column=foo to the cell that I can select on?
[21:14:05] <coldhead> html tables are row oriented
[21:14:31] <coldhead> if you want to seelect the nth cell of every row
[21:14:32] <Spadeski> lol
[21:14:38] <coldhead> maybe use
[21:14:41] <coldhead> ?nth-child
[21:14:41] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[21:14:42] <Spadeski> Hows it goin ?
[21:16:23] <coldhead> it's going okay, Spadeski
[21:16:34] <coldhead> waiting for various consumer goods to be delivered
[21:16:39] <coldhead> i'm living the dream
[21:16:53] <Spadeski> You and me both :D stress reliever
[21:16:55] <Spadeski> haha
[21:24:25] <kornerr> hi
[21:25:25] <kornerr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ has an example to append ajax data to an html element
[21:25:37] <kornerr> is there a method to set data of an html element?
[21:25:40] <kornerr> i haven't found one
[21:27:12] <Spadeski> konerr .load()
[21:33:07] <kornerr> Spadeski: hm. it wants <DOCTYPE and the rest
[21:33:47] <Spadeski> should
[21:33:52] <Spadeski> umm
[21:34:09] <kornerr> i want just to set my p element text
[21:34:11] <kornerr> ajax thing
[21:34:50] <Spadeski> kornerr:  		//$("#info").load("process-sortable.php?"+ Variable  );
[21:35:12] <Spadeski> ohh
[21:35:35] <Spadeski> $("p").css("font","bold");
[21:35:50] <Spadeski> idk make it more clear
[21:36:11] <kornerr> well
[21:36:17] <kornerr> i'm implementing smth like tabs
[21:36:31] <kornerr> when i click on a link, i want my p element get text of that link address
[21:36:42] <kornerr> which is body of html, not complete html
[21:42:27] <kornerr> Spadeski: it's .html() i was looking for
[21:42:41] <Spadeski> ah
[21:42:49] <kornerr> i thought it only returns reading the "Get ..." in docs, but an example on internet showed me i can also set
[21:47:44] <cypha> can someone explain how IE is accepting a json array from me? (content-type: application/json)
[21:47:47] <cypha> ?
[21:47:51] <cypha> i thought that wasn't possible
[21:50:09] <coldhead> maybe jQuery is making everything better somehow?
[21:50:17] <coldhead> i've never really had a problem with that header stuff
[21:50:22] <coldhead> it usually Just Works
[21:53:13] <Spadeski> coldhead wanna help me with draggables rating system
[21:54:32] <coldhead> no sir!
[21:55:33] <coldhead> i'm trying to debug some idiot's code that is ruining everything
[21:55:38] <coldhead> i suspect the idiot was me last friday
[21:55:56] <coldhead> but i'm pretty much puking blood in any case
[21:58:03] <coldhead> yay, idiot vanquished
[21:58:13] <coldhead> in your face, last friday me!
[21:58:50] <cypha> coldhead, oh, but u know what i'm talking about when I say that IE is supposedly not supposed to accept application/json?
[21:59:21] <coldhead> i know there is supposed some issue with json headers and IE
[21:59:29] <coldhead> but i have no idea about the specifics
[21:59:32] <coldhead> and it has never bitten me
[21:59:45] <coldhead> supposedly*
[21:59:53] <ndss56> does anyone know how to put a background image in jsfiddle? i have a background color set but want to set a background image. any image as an example will do see http://jsfiddle.net/RBLCL/4/
[21:59:56] <coldhead> people like gnarf know such things intimately
[22:00:00] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:00:14] <cypha> haha
[22:00:27] <cypha> gnarf: ping?
[22:00:50] <coldhead> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/RBLCL/5/ ?
[22:01:09] <ndss56> ill check
[22:01:14] <coldhead> pls
[22:01:42] <ndss56> lol
[22:01:50] <ndss56> you got one that is not animated?
[22:02:03] <MaxMeents> If I link to something on statefarm from my site then I can use statefarm's logo for the link right? What about as attrubition (can't spell), can I put their logo next to bing if for example I"m returning bing searches of statefarm links
[22:02:32] <ndss56> coldhead: more importantly why is the text "row one" not visible?
[22:11:27] <Zxurian> is there a shorthand method of binding a click event to anywhere BUT the target element?
[22:12:30] <Zxurian> like $("#foo").click(function(){ do_this(); }); for when someone clicks inside the #foo element, is there a way to see if a user clicks anywhere except #foo
[22:14:00] <ndss56> Zxurian: yes
[22:14:15] <Zxurian> ndss: can I have a hint?
[22:14:21] <ndss56> Zxurian: yes
[22:14:39] <ddoom> :not
[22:15:06] <ndss56> Zxurian: something like on mouseup() check if #foo was clicked if not then you know
[22:16:08] <ddoom> Zxurian: I could be wrong but try $(':not(#foo)').click(...)
[22:16:16] <Zxurian> so... bind to the mouseup event on the document, then inside that, check to see if the click was actually inside #foo?
[22:16:56] <Zxurian> ddom: I don't think :not (or .not()) would work, as that would bind the click even to every other element but #foo, which I really don't want to do
[22:19:13] <ddoom> Zxurian: what DO you want to do?
[22:19:32] <ndss56> Zxurian: add a class when #foo is clicked and check for that.
[22:20:06] <Zxurian> ndss: i'm trying to get the opposite, I need to see if when the mouse is clicked, it wasn't inside #foo
[22:20:53] <Zxurian> ddom: using .not() would bind a click event to every element within the dom, so if there are 100 elements, thats 100 click events added. I'm trying to see if tehre's just a global "cliked anywhere but <here>" method or event
[22:22:48] <ndss56> Zxurian: i understand your problem, and i've given you the solution. obviously if the class is not added then it hasn't been clicked.
[22:23:30] <Zxurian> bah, missed the class comment, should've done that earlier, I've used it before
[22:24:04] <Zxurian> i guess I was just wondering from a language sense whether it was possible to detect a click event anyere "but" a location, instead of registering a click on the document and testing for a class instead
[22:24:16] <Zxurian> thanks for the head slap
[22:34:57] <juha_> about 90 minutes of sleep and off to a great week, yay
[22:38:01] <jagguli> hi how do i bind onclick for elements in a dialog
[22:38:35] <jagguli> is there something like ready for dialog?
[22:40:02] <jagguli> is there a onload for dialog, called after the dialog contents has been loaded ?
[22:47:43] <jagguli> dialog onload, load doesnot seem to get the form elements ..
[22:49:01] <jagguli> anyone ??
[22:49:17] <Zxurian> jagguli: you can bind to elements within a dialog just as you would any other element
[22:50:43] <jagguli> Zxurian: thats what i assumed but its not working, when content is loaded ajax style
[22:50:58] <jagguli> i have to bind it when it loads
[22:51:34] <Zxurian> then put your binding functions in the success function of your ajax call
[22:56:04] <hdtdi> hi guys i have a quetsion.  so i am messing around with the fadeIn and fadeOut effect. right now i have a div with text inside and onclick the div fadesOut and after that fades in again.. http://pastebin.com/56HwRYEC here is the code. but the thing is when it fadesIn, the text kinda bounce ..is this the default behavior or the problem is in my Tv?
[22:58:26] <Zxurian> hdtdi: seems to work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Esvww/
[22:59:08] <jagguli> Zxurian: thanks that worked
[22:59:27] <Zxurian> jagguli: no problem
[22:59:52] <hdtdi> Zxurian, try to click it as soon as it gets visible again.. youll see the text kinda shakes.. a little
[23:10:35] <Zxurian> hdtdi: it's not shaking for me
[23:11:01] <hdtdi> hmm
[23:11:06] <hdtdi> thanks  :)
[23:11:13] <Zxurian> tested in both chrome & firefox
[23:11:24] <Zxurian> netierh displays jittering or any type of abnormality
[23:44:29] <cypha> I currently have a script that allows me to authenticate a user. However, when the JSON object is returned, I'd like to be able to use it's values in jQuery.template {{if}} statements. How can I do this? (I supposedly need to 'decode' the json first?)
[23:53:19] <Chani> hmm. I notice tables like to go below one another, even what they're really skinny and could easily fit side by side. what's the Right Way to get two tables on the same line? do I have to nest them in another table?
