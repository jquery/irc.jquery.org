[00:00:35] <carlt0n5> well i was thinking 1 container div w/ 2 columns, inside each the div that will slide out to left/right
[00:01:54] <Cork> carlt0n5: that should work farly well too
[00:03:09] <cse84> hi. i already know about jQuery.support and jQuery.browser to learn about properties of the client,
[00:03:37] <cse84> is there any way to learn more about the client than what those two tell me?
[00:04:17] <cse84> things like memory usage, cpu usage, DNS server the client uses.
[00:05:26] <Cork> cse84: no, the browser doesn't want to leak that information
[00:06:07] <cse84> thx.
[00:06:32] <cse84> i thought so. now i'm a sad panda.
[00:08:10] <Cork> carlt0n5: your trying to do something like http://jsfiddle.net/GMCgh/1/ ?
[00:09:33] <Cork> uh... or even better http://jsfiddle.net/GMCgh/2/
[00:11:43] <JKarsrud> nah, combining selectors suck Cork! :P
[00:11:53] <Cork> :)
[00:14:34] <carlt0n5> Cork, you are the fucking shit
[00:14:40] <carlt0n5> did you write that up?
[00:17:20] <carlt0n5> Cork, thank you
[00:17:48] <Cork> carlt0n5: yes i did, nothing fancy though :)
[00:18:05] <carlt0n5> well i appreciate it immensely
[00:18:15] <Cork> lol, yrw
[00:19:49] <carlt0n5> im giving you cred in my code comments
[00:20:11] <Cork> no need, just use it :)
[00:20:20] <Cork> (if you want to)
[00:34:08] <adfdsf> Hi people good morrning
[00:34:18] <adfdsf> It exist any channel about jqgrid?
[00:38:44] <JKarsrud> nope, this is it
[00:39:51] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/2/ why is it allowing multiple options to be selected?
[00:40:16] <someprimetime> seems to behaving more like checkboxes than radio boxes
[00:40:29] <JKarsrud> someprimetime: they need to have the same name
[00:40:51] <JKarsrud> or else they don't belong to the same group of radiobuttons
[00:41:06] <someprimetime> ah, alright thanks
[00:41:08] <gabri> Hi people anyone know about flexigrid?
[00:42:13] <JKarsrud> someprimetime: updated with label wrapping the inputs too; http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/C5C2x/4/
[00:42:23] <JKarsrud> so that you can actually click the text to select
[00:42:29] <someprimetime> JKarsrud: nice thanks man
[00:42:40] <JKarsrud> either that or do a label for="radiobuttonid"
[00:43:00] <someprimetime> yeah i think i might hook an id on the label
[00:43:11] <someprimetime> for each one, which will have a different image on it
[00:43:16] <JKarsrud> someprimetime: aight :)
[00:43:42] <JKarsrud> yeah, whatever works for you. If you need id's then <label for=""> is the cleanest imo
[00:43:55] <JKarsrud> but I don't care that much really
[00:48:02] <gabri> anyone know about flexigrid or other datagrids to work with jquery=?
[00:48:59] <JKarsrud> what do you want to know, gabri?
[00:49:56] <gabri> What is the best and free grid ?
[00:51:11] <xec_> gabri: there is no such thing, they are all slightly different and fit slightly different tasks. this is a good place to start though: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35122722/Grid-OtherGrids
[00:51:20] <gabri> mm JKarsrud  this code isen't work for me i can't see a flexigrid
[00:51:21] <gabri> http://pastebin.com/fZjj0Wxu
[00:57:48] <gabri> JKarsrud:  can you see any code error?
[01:10:55] <gabri> xec_:  the code isn't work for me
[01:12:21] <xec_> ?demo @ gabri
[01:12:21] <bot-t> gabri, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:12:40] <gabri> thanks xec_
[01:13:02] <xec_> check for errors in your console as well
[01:13:26] <gabri> mm xec_  so how i cna upload my php file to jsfiddle?¿
[01:13:47] <xec_> gabri: no you will have to create dummy data and pass that instead
[01:14:07] <gabri> I need learn more about it
[01:15:31] <xec_> gabri: of course, if you can host your site live somewhere you wouldnt need jsfiddle
[01:16:15] <gabri> mm xec_  i am uploading my demo

[02:33:49] <DukeDrake> $('#myarea').remove($(this)) - correct syntax?
[02:33:50] <gabri> xec_:  i don't know why i can't see any data on my datagrid http://www.servidor-online.com/celiacos/?accion=logueado
[02:35:03] <gabri> xec_:  i thing that my code is good
[02:36:35] <DukeDrake> I want to remove this from $('#myarea') ...
[02:37:42] <nFFF> DukeDrake, jsfiddle.net
[02:42:22] <quicksilver> DukeDrake: no.
[02:42:27] <quicksilver> DukeDrake: just $(this).remove();
[02:42:39] <quicksilver> it doesn't matter when you're trying to remove it from, there is no need to specify.
[02:43:24] <DukeDrake> quicksilver: thanx
[02:44:51] <djj_> Can someone help me... I am trying to build a grid view diary of slots. Which list times vertically and has slots going horizontally. I have come across  jquery week calendar but this is not quite what I'm quite after. Is there anything out there like what I am trying to achieve
[02:45:33] <bigkevmcd> djj_: jquery.fullcalendar perhaps ?
[02:46:58] <djj_> bigkevmcd: I've seen this one it looks nice indeed :) however I need to have the times listed vertically down the side
[02:47:25] <bigkevmcd> err...they are?
[02:47:36] <bigkevmcd> djj_: have you looked at the day view?
[02:47:36] <djj_> bigkevmcd: Something more along the lines of this http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html
[02:48:11] <djj_> bigkevmcd: :O I just saw this, sorry.
[02:50:04] <_ramo> hi
[02:51:04] <xec_> gabri: did you get it working on your own? i can see the table...
[02:51:29] <gabri> xec_:  yes it's work so i can't see the navigation bar
[02:52:17] <gabri> xec_:  i am reading this tutorial http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:navigator
[02:52:33] <xec_> navigation bar?
[02:52:53] <xec_> like paging and next/prev?
[02:53:03] <gabri> yes xec_  navigator add , edit, delete buttons
[02:53:12] <gabri> http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=wiki%3Anavigator&media=wiki:navigator1.png
[02:53:54] <xec_> well, i can see the next/prev buttons
[02:54:22] <gabri> yes xec_  but i can't see add, edit , delete buttons
[02:54:37] <kro_> is this room alive?
[02:54:52] <_ramo> i've got this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/  what i want to achieve is, when i click some checkboxed and i hit the "Show values" button, that i get the values of all checked checkboxes
[02:55:01] <_ramo> somehow my code isn't working
[02:55:26] <xec_> gabri: i have never used jqgrid - i can't help you
[02:56:52] <kro_> I'm building an app where I only want to allow the users that are signed up on my forum to use. I'm assuming I can do this by using the forums cookies and check there username correct?
[02:57:14] <kro_> Actually, I also want to display there forum name too
[02:57:56] <xec_> kro_: what does this have to do with jQuery?
[02:58:22] <kro_> assuming I can use jquery to display the username in the cookie?
[02:59:43] <gabri> xec_:  the problem is invalid object initializer
[02:59:58] <Xotix> hi, i need to pass some data to my server, save it and return  true/false. Don't need to request any data. What jquery component should i use?
[03:00:06] <xec_> _ramo: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/1/ <-- something like that?
[03:01:25] <IgnisDiabolus> Xotix. $.ajax
[03:01:26] <xec_> Xotix: depending on your server, i would guess any of the ajax functions will do the trick
[03:02:01] <kro_> is this possible ?
[03:02:07] <Xotix> do all the ajax functions like $.post base on $.ajax?
[03:02:25] <Wiz_KeeD> can i lign up 3 text field in a row using jquery mobile?
[03:02:32] <IgnisDiabolus> Xotix, yes
[03:03:03] <xec_> kro_: jquery core does not help with cookies, but many plugins availabe.. google for "jquery cookie"
[03:03:05] <IgnisDiabolus>  $.ajax({ type: 'POST' }); =>  $.post();
[03:03:23] <_ramo> xec_: do i need a form here?
[03:03:43] <kro_> Is it possible to read a cookie that came from something else?
[03:03:51] <Xotix> ok thanks
[03:03:53] <gabri> xec_:  it fixed http://www.servidor-online.com/celiacos/?accion=logueado
[03:03:57] <kro_> example, read cookie from /forum in another page.
[03:03:58] <xec_> _ramo: i just did it for easy demonstration, but yes - .serialize() works with forms
[03:04:22] <_ramo> xec_: i need it without forms, as i showed in my first example
[03:04:33] <_ramo> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/ like there
[03:04:46] <xec_> kro_: that sounds like a security vulnerability to me...
[03:05:12] <kro_> xec_: hm?
[03:05:43] <xec_> kro_: you can't read cookies from another page
[03:05:51] <kro_> xec_: my app uploads images... i'm trying to only allow users that are on the forum to upload images. but the app itself is not part of the cookie......
[03:06:02] <kro_> part of the forum*
[03:06:07] <kro_> but on the same domain...
[03:06:46] <xec_> kro_: well, if its the same page, you can. you will need to supply more specific information for more specific answers
[03:07:19] <xec_> i suggest you read up on cookies
[03:07:27] <kro_> yeah I have been.
[03:07:28] <_ramo> xec_: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/4/ but now just for multiple checkboxes
[03:09:15] <kro_> So Iuser is logged in on /forums the software is http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Cookies . Is it possible to get cookie of the username of that cookie from for another page?
[03:09:18] <xec_> _ramo: what are you trying to achieve with this? the only reason you're getting one is because .val() will only return the first
[03:10:26] <_ramo> xec_: i need to build up a comma seperated strings with the values of the checkboxes, but without sending the form. every time i click on an checkbox, the value should be appended to the previous checked
[03:10:53] <xec_> _ramo: why do you want a comma separated list, what is it good for
[03:11:07] <mawalu> Hello, I have a problem, a variable which I need for an ajax request in a setInterval function must be 0 at the first run. At the other runs it must have a vale I get from the server success. my code is http://jsfiddle.net/9hudp/
[03:11:17] <xec_> _ramo: i'm just thinking its easy enough to make, i just dont see the point
[03:11:28] <xec_> _ramo: most likely you want to do something with it?
[03:11:47] <_ramo> xec_: it's for a facebook send button. i want to have a list of facebook friend id's, and the facebook send button expect a comma seperated string of id's, like 1234565, 234325262, ....
[03:13:15] <xec_> _ramo: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/5/
[03:13:37] <kro_> So  I read its possible if the cookie is on the same domain
[03:13:50] <_ramo> xec_: that looks really good.
[03:14:14] <_ramo> xec_: how is it managed with the trailing slash?
[03:14:19] <_ramo> trailing comma i mean
[03:14:31] <xec_> _ramo: read up on .join()
[03:14:39] <xec_> it will only insert between values
[03:14:46] <xec_> as you see from the example
[03:14:50] <_ramo> cool, that's what i wanted
[03:14:55] <_ramo> thank you
[03:14:58] <_ramo> xec_++
[03:15:40] <xec_> yw :)
[03:16:20] <_ramo> is it possible to reload a snippet of js, for example: the facebook send button exists on load -> the user selects some checkboxes -> the js for the facebook button event is filled up with these selected values?
[03:16:45] <nFFF> mawalu, so just do a simple check to see if(counter==1)
[03:18:48] <xec_> _ramo: you're not making a lot of sense
[03:18:57] <_ramo> :)
[03:19:09] <_ramo> yep, i guess i found the solution for that
[03:19:17] <nFFF> _ramo, it's just posting a form
[03:26:08] <_ramo> xec_: the question was related to this piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/6/  the "to" argument must be filled with the string that is build up with the join, every time a user clicks on an additional checkbox respectivley de-check a checkbox
[03:26:46] <xec_> _ramo: what does the FB.ui do, and when is it called?
[03:30:18] <xec_> _ramo: http://jsfiddle.net/NtPDA/7/
[03:31:37] <xec_> _ramo: do you see what i did there?
[03:31:52] <_ramo> xec_: yes
[03:32:03] <_ramo> if i place this on document ready, it should work, right?
[03:32:16] <xec_> i have no idea
[03:32:33] <xec_> =)
[03:51:30] <duncanbeevers> Howdy. For most event binding, I can use $("#ele").on("click", handler)... but what's the recommended way of dealing with this when you have transient elements whose parent you might not know, like an overlay?
[03:53:00] <duncanbeevers> My first guess would be to bind to $(document.body), but that seems kind of over-reaching since most of the time the overlay won't be present.
[03:54:07] <nFFF> duncanbeevers, i.e. theres a transparent overlay, that's over #ele ?
[03:54:58] <duncanbeevers> No, #ele doesn't exist at DOM-ready, it gets pulled in later, inside like a lightbox.
[03:56:05] <nFFF> Ok, and whats the issue?
[03:57:17] <duncanbeevers> I'd like to set up my event handlers when the page loads, not when the lightbox content comes in. Since the lightbox element doesn't yet exist, I can't bind to it.
[03:57:34] <duncanbeevers> In the past, I'd have used something like .live or .livequery
[03:57:57] <duncanbeevers> And I was wondering if just binding to document.body is the recommended method for dealing with cases like this.
[03:59:15] <nFFF> I guess you don't have any other option than what I know
[03:59:35] <nFFF> Either bind when you create #ele, or bind when DOM loads to the body
[04:00:19] <xec_> duncanbeevers: use delegates. if you're using latest jquery, they are available through .on()
[04:01:32] <duncanbeevers> xec: I get that, I guess I was just wondering what the performance implications of binding to document.body and delegating to my elements were.
[04:02:00] <duncanbeevers> It seemed like an anti-pattern since .live was deprecated.
[04:02:34] <nFFF> Is there any reason why you don't bind the event after #ele is created ?
[04:02:43] <nFFF> Just out of curiosity
[04:02:53] <xec_> no, it's fine, and performs better than multiple bindings (at a certain number)
[04:03:11] <duncanbeevers> It's a reasonable idea, but I don't like the idea of having to bind on lightbox create and unbind when the lightbox is dismissed.
[04:03:26] <xec_> duncanbeevers: only reason .live deprecated is because of delegates, and more recently .on
[04:04:39] <nFFF> I just created a lightbox last week, and that's exactly how I did it :<
[04:05:48] <duncanbeevers> I think I'll see if I can convince the designers to always spawn the lightbox within an already-present parent element and then bind on that.
[04:05:55] <xec_> both ways work fine, performance is a non-issue - but it is more work to create a script that keeps binding and unbinding :)
[04:09:40] <nFFF> IS there a better way to do a lightbox? I simply $('body').append('<div class="lightbox"></div>'); $('.lightbox').click(..
[04:10:27] <xec_> nFFF: i usually have my html in a html file ;)
[04:10:54] <nFFF> xec_, it's inline js :>
[04:10:57] <nFFF> so it is in a html file
[04:11:04] <xec_> even worse!
[04:11:11] <xec_> i have my js in a js file
[04:11:13] <xec_> :P
[04:11:21] <IgnisDiabolus> and your css in your css file?
[04:11:22] <nFFF> :|
[04:11:23] <Guest11617> nFFF: if you dynamically generate the box, and it should be posible to have it multible times, save it as a reference instead of selecting it
[04:11:25] <xec_> IgnisDiabolus: indeed :P
[04:11:35] <IgnisDiabolus> how bout your php? on your php files?
[04:11:53] <xec_> IgnisDiabolus: i don't do php, but that seems like a good place for it :D
[04:13:35] <keirlavelle> how do i change my nick please?
[04:13:53] <Cork> /nick <new nick>
[04:13:55] <IgnisDiabolus> nFFF, lightboxes are usually dynamically created. following progressive enhancement. your link could still take you somewhere to see the content of the lightbox. when js is enabled, the lightbox is dynamically created to hold that content. :)
[04:13:58] <keirlavelle> cheers
[04:15:47] <Viduthalai> hey dudes,  in highcharts , how can i export print ?
[04:16:58] <nFFF> I guess becuase the content in my lightbox is static, and only gets loaded once
[04:17:10] <nFFF> I can udnerstand the benefit for dynamic lightboxes
[04:21:16] <IgnisDiabolus> nFFF, well then. css have it display none. when it's called do the lightbox stuff.
[04:35:12] <john-dev> hi, i use .remove() to delete an <object ? swf>.. is there a possibility to readd it later to the dom?
[04:35:22] <john-dev> readd*
[04:38:53] <IgnisDiabolus> john-dev, maybe don't remove it. just .css('display', 'none');
[04:39:39] <IgnisDiabolus> or clone it before removing
[04:39:43] <john-dev> it's a flash video i i cahnge it's size and source.. so a reload is needed
[04:39:52] <IgnisDiabolus> oh
[04:40:06] <john-dev> i want the whole object to reload inside of a container..
[04:42:03] <Acriax> Hi, is it possible to have different callbacks on the .toggle() function?
[04:42:22] <Acriax> or better yet, the slideToggle() function
[04:43:25] <Acriax> Or do I have to create a bool and do something like openOrClosed != openOrClosed and do an if-statement after that?
[04:44:41] <IgnisDiabolus> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[04:47:05] <nFFF> Acriax, if you know the default state you cna just checked against a var to see if it's opened or closed
[04:47:37] <Acriax> nFFF: oh, that might work
[04:50:31] <Acriax> if ($(this).is(":visible")) <-- beautiful code :D
[04:52:54] <chee> :D
[04:53:18] <IgnisDiabolus> Acriax, actually, i think it's if ($(this).is(':hidden')) { var state = 'closed'; } else { var state = 'open'; }
[04:53:46] <Cork> uh... why not just use a class instead?
[04:53:53] <IgnisDiabolus> rawr
[04:53:53] <Acriax> both seemed to work
[04:54:28] <Acriax> I needed to update the height of the parent fancybox dynamically after toggling the element inside
[04:55:35] <nFFF> just display:inline-block; to the parent? :P
[04:56:35] <IgnisDiabolus> don't put a height in the parent :)
[04:56:48] <mindis|wurk> sup. would anyone happen to know if it's possible to alter the source of images inside an iframe? just tried doing so and it does change the src but it won't load the actual image
[04:57:15] <nFFF> mindis|wurk, you'll have to make an ajax call I think
[04:57:16] <Acriax> well, fancybox sets a height automatically depending on the size of the content. But then when the height of the content inside changes, fancybox doesn't update.
[04:57:26] <nFFF> if you want to reload them without reloading the page
[04:58:07] <nFFF> Acriax, don't set a height, and display:inline-block; to fancybox, and it'll adjust it's height depending on the content
[04:58:34] <Cork> mindis|wurk: uh... if you can actually change the src attribute, the image should load; might be from the browsers cache though
[04:58:52] <mindis|wurk> Cork that's what i would think but nothing happens in either FF or chrome
[04:59:01] <Acriax> nFFF: uhm, it sounds logical, but I don't think fancybox plays that nice :) I'd have to go inside the fancybox script and mess about
[04:59:09] <Cork> mindis|wurk: if you want to avoid the cache, add a ?timestamp at the end of the url
[04:59:27] <mindis|wurk> Cork yeah but the problem is that absolutely nothing shows up
[04:59:28] <nFFF> Acriax, sorry no idea about fnacybox script, thought it was just a class
[04:59:30] <Cork> mindis|wurk: if that doesn't work i would have to see the source to tell more
[04:59:41] <Acriax> nFFF: okay :)
[05:00:02] <Cork> mindis|wurk: well actually see the source in action even :)
[05:00:06] <mindis|wurk> the URL is correct since for debug purposes i tried creating a completely new image object and it did load the image
[05:01:12] <mindis|wurk> yet if i look at the src with firebug in the real image object that did nothing, it says failed to load the given URL
[05:01:19] <_ramo> how cna i set text into a input field?
[05:01:32] <Cork> ?.val @ _ramo
[05:01:33] <bot-t> _ramo, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[05:01:51] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i force a select tag to select a certain option?
[05:01:54] <Wiz_KeeD> or the first option
[05:02:08] <_ramo> Cork   it should have the structure <input id="xx" value="1234">Product 1</input>
[05:02:10] <_ramo> is that possible?
[05:02:11] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: see the last link :)
[05:02:19] <aaronmcadam> Wiz_KeeD: $(option).attr('selected','selected')
[05:02:20] <Cork> _ramo: no
[05:02:39] <Cork> _ramo: you use label for the label
[05:03:01] <Cork> _ramo: input is like br, img and hr, it doesn't have an end tag
[05:03:48] <_ramo> how would that look like? <label for="firstIinput">Prodct 1</lable> <input id=firstInput value=1234 /> ?
[05:04:01] <Cork> yup
[05:04:18] <Cork> you need a name on the input field though
[05:07:59] <Wiz_KeeD> it just won't work with jquerymobile on!
[05:07:59] <Wiz_KeeD> :(
[05:08:20] <Staley> when doing a query i get this as a callback parameter
[05:08:22] <Staley> jQuery17102766154727432877_1328533627243&_=1328533630386
[05:08:37] <Staley> how can that be
[05:10:43] <erichynds> Staley: jsonp callback
[05:11:12] <snagnever> morning! i'd like to know if there's a method like the Array.concat but for maps/objects
[05:11:26] <Staley> yes but that is two parameters
[05:11:54] <Staley> and i get a ncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[05:11:54] <Staley> (anonymous function)
[05:12:30] <Staley> how can i avoid sending &_=1328533630386
[05:13:49] <erichynds> Staley: do you have the cache param set to false?
[05:14:25] <Staley> no
[05:14:33] <mindis|wurk> ah, the url WAS wrong, it just show up a bit odd in FF but chrome showed absolute paths
[05:14:44] <Noth> guy si Have a href element and in IE toolbar it shows  some parameter called jQuery1620738258597462427="18"whats that?
[05:15:15] <snagnever> is there a method like the Array.concat but for maps/objects?
[05:16:05] <black_warlock> godday peeps
[05:16:38] <black_warlock> how can i roll back to entry.contentSnippet ?
[05:16:41] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/udrej/21/
[05:21:22] <nFFF> black_warlock, your code isn't going to work
[05:21:52] <nFFF> your missing a ';' where you initilize myFeed
[05:22:21] <john-dev> how can i change the clip of flowplayer swf using jquery?
[05:22:22] <nFFF> also myFeed += is the same as myFeed = myFeed + ...;
[05:23:01] <Cork> nFFF: ; is optional in js
[05:23:42] <zdjin9> cds
[05:23:43] <nFFF> I also think live is deprecated
[05:23:53] <Staley> do anyone know how to get rid of this part:&_=1328533630386 from the callback parameter jQuery17102766154727432877_1328533627243&_=1328533630386
[05:23:57] <nFFF> Cork, ah fair play
[05:24:28] <Cork> Staley: tell ajax, to not overide cache
[05:25:05] <Staley> is this the correct syntax
[05:25:06] <Cork> Staley: {cache: true}
[05:25:06] <Staley> $.ajax({
[05:25:06] <Staley>     	  url: restUri + "api/shipment.json?" + paramStr,
[05:25:06] <Staley>     	  cache: false
[05:25:06] <Staley>     	});
[05:25:24] <Cork> Staley: its cache true, false is what you have
[05:25:30] <Staley> ok
[05:25:32] <adisbladis> I have binded an input field with type="file" with this: "chat.find('.sendfile-input:hidden').bind('change', function(event) {", but if I change it more then one time it fires off more times, I want it to just fire off once every time I change it
[05:25:49] <Cork> Staley: it will also mean its not garanteed the client will contact your server
[05:26:02] <Staley> hmm ok
[05:26:08] <Cork> Staley: cause if the url is in cache, the client will use that instead
[05:26:40] <Staley> the problem originats after i got the newest version of jquery
[05:27:07] <Cork> Staley: wahts the problem?
[05:27:39] <Staley> in jquery 1.4.x you get a callback parameter of i,e jsonp1328521939554
[05:28:17] <Staley> this is processed correctly by the application but with these version after 1.5 does not work ;(
[05:28:28] <risky> guys I am having trouble with my website menu in IE7-8, the background images do not seem to show
[05:28:30] <Cork> and here its jQuery17102766154727432877_1328533627243
[05:28:46] <Cork> or do you mean the server doesn't process parameters correctly?
[05:29:19] <Staley> i get the response correctly from the server but it does not show in the application
[05:29:51] <Staley> i think something goes wrong in the getJSON function
[05:30:33] <Cork> Staley: you prob want dataType: 'jsonp' in there
[05:32:25] <Staley> couldn't be because the callback has another "parameter" in it?
[05:36:02] <Wiz_KeeD> aaronmcadam, it worked thank you
[05:43:40] <Fenweru> Hi
[05:44:07] <nFFF> adisbladis, just check against a counter? .change(function() { if(typeof counter === 'undefined') { var counter = 1; /* code */ } });
[05:44:30] <Fenweru> I'm using the ajax function and I need to know, what format should the params be in "success: function(data)" ?  Do I use data.one data.two or data[one] data[two] ?
[05:45:05] <Fenweru> http://pastebin.com/G4Qr2kNd
[05:45:33] <Fenweru> This code is not finished
[05:46:13] <nFFF> depends whats returned?
[05:46:39] <Fenweru> json
[05:46:58] <nFFF> getJSON() may be more appropriate?
[05:47:29] <Fenweru> Did you see my code?
[05:47:43] <nFFF> sec
[05:48:33] <nFFF> Ok
[05:48:34] <Fenweru> thanks
[05:48:47] <_ramo> hey
[05:48:54] <_ramo> how can i post a bug to the jquery-UI guys?
[05:49:01] <nFFF> So depending on the object you would just do data.name or whatever the objects values are
[05:49:08] <nFFF> but you have a bad if statement
[05:49:19] <nFFF> line 25:
[05:49:19] <Fenweru> Just can't find an example of this format anywhere. Ok, probably should have just tried it!
[05:49:38] <xec_> _ramo: how sure are you, on a scale from "not sure" to "hmmm" are you
[05:49:48] <xec_> that it is indeed a bug :D
[05:50:01] <_ramo> xec_: pardon?
[05:50:04] <duncanbeevers> _ramo: It's a pretty convoluted process.
[05:50:09] <_ramo> i've created an account in the trac
[05:50:25] <nFFF> You need to kow what ids the object contains
[05:50:34] <nFFF> and then just access them object.id
[05:50:44] <_ramo> but can't create  a bugreport there... if i try to save it, i get the message: Submission rejected as potential spam  (Akismet says content is spam)
[05:51:00] <_ramo> i've just provided an jsfiddle and some text
[05:51:05] <xec_> _ramo: what is this bug?
[05:51:07] <nFFF> you'll probably want to check it's not empty
[05:51:25] <Xotix> $('#foo table').html(); gives me tbody thead tfoot etc without the tabel tag. How can i include the table tag?
[05:51:40] <_ramo> xec_:  look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9054111/jquery-ui-autocompletion-selects-result-items-automatically-if-mouse-points-on-t    on the edit section i've added
[05:51:45] <_ramo> can you reproduce it?
[05:52:13] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: that's almost tricky.
[05:52:42] <_ramo> xec_ it's about the autocompletion plugin from jquery ui
[05:52:43] <duncanbeevers> _ramo: That's a little weird that it's rejecting your bug submission. Try letting someone in #jquery-ui-dev know.
[05:52:44] <Xotix> But it is correct that it doesn't take the table tag?
[05:52:45] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: you do $("<div>").html($("element").html()).html()
[05:52:55] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: yes, that's how it should be.
[05:53:03] <_ramo> duncanbeevers: thank you for the hint
[05:53:17] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: also i think that oneliner i just did works. if it doesn't nag me until i make one that works =P
[05:53:17] <_ramo> duncanbeevers: hehe, empty channel
[05:53:33] <duncanbeevers> _ramo: Sorry, #jqueryui-dev
[05:53:57] <Xotix> Hooloovoork:  that looks not nice. But okay, anyway i'll add them by hand. Its static so who cares. :)
[05:54:11] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: yea it's not very pretty
[05:54:32] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: but html() gets the contents of the element you have, which doesn't include the selected element itself
[05:54:40] <xec_> _ramo: i don't get it - what exactly is the bug? what were you writing in the bug report?
[05:55:11] <Hooloovoork> Xotix: also the one i did won't work. try this. $("<div>").html($("elementYouWant").clone()).html()
[05:55:22] <_ramo> xec_:
[05:55:28] <Xotix> that sounds good thanks
[05:57:38] <_ramo> xec_: do you understand the bug?
[05:57:49] <quicksilver> Hooloovoork: you want to move that ) after clone() to the end, I think.
[05:57:53] <xec_> _ramo: not at all
[05:58:09] <_ramo> xec_: how can i show it to you?
[05:58:13] <Hooloovoork> quicksilver: i do?
[05:58:24] <_ramo> the problem is, that on focus is always active even if the resultlist refreshes.
[05:58:29] <_ramo> so if you delete the 2
[05:58:44] <Hooloovoork> quicksilver: noooo, i'm slow today but not so slow i could have missed something like that D:
[05:58:44] <_ramo> the list refreshes and you have again "Sizzle JS 2" there
[05:58:48] <Hooloovoork> i hope
[05:58:51] <_ramo> in the search field
[05:58:53] <quicksilver> Hooloovoork: ok, you're right, sorry :)
[05:59:18] <Hooloovoork> quicksilver: =D
[05:59:42] <Noth> guys I am clonning buttons and and need to clone its listener(on click) also I found two ways using delegate or manully adding new click listener to every button cloned what is the difference?
[05:59:42] <xec_> _ramo: what? you "delete the 2"?
[06:00:02] <_ramo> yes, with the backbutton of your keyboard
[06:00:11] <_ramo> just delete the character "2"
[06:01:11] <_ramo> xec_:  place your mouse in this position that if you start entering "si"  the item "Sizzle JS 2" is focussed
[06:01:26] <_ramo> than hit one time the backspace button of your keyboard
[06:01:34] <_ramo> and look what happens in the input field
[06:01:36] <_ramo> don't move the mouse
[06:03:26] <xec_> _ramo: i still don't get it, but i added the jquery css for you in the demo: http://jsfiddle.net/zK3Wc/23/
[06:03:35] <Kambfhase> Noth: deletage uses one handler further up the DOM tree to caprute the events.
[06:04:03] <Noth> Kambfhase: so which one to use ?
[06:04:19] <xec_> _ramo: i select "Sizzle JS 2" - remove the "2" and get the suggestions for "Sizzle JS " of course... what is the bug?
[06:04:37] <Kambfhase> is you buttons are of the same class its dead simle to use delegate.
[06:05:15] <Noth> Kambfhase: yeah buttons are same i mean both seems easy to use in term of implementing ...
[06:05:37] <Kambfhase> All ways are easy. Its just JavaScript
[06:05:39] <_ramo> xec_:  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024   this is the same. the bug is, that if you delete the "2", "Sizzle JS 2" is preselected again and displayed in the search input field
[06:06:05] <Kambfhase> delegation might take 10 more minutes to learn, but its worth it!
[06:08:14] <xec_> _ramo: so.... you are trying to submit a bugreport that already exists?
[06:08:36] <_ramo> xec_:  yeah, someone from jqueryui-dev told me... i've search for such a bug...
[06:08:40] <_ramo> but didn't found it
[06:08:56] <xec_> i see
[06:09:27] <xec_> you didn't mention that i had to have my cursor over the item that got selected.
[06:10:05] <Iszak> Anyone going to jQuery UK conference?
[06:11:43] <Noth> Kambfhase: is there any performance issue? because i have one page inside of it there is from with probably 25 fields which gets cloned and coul get cloned up to 999 times.  what I want to do is use delegate for whole parrent of ->$("#mainParrent").delegate  etc..... I worry about perfrmance
[06:12:28] <motaka2> in jquery is it possible to disable all input elements inside a table?
[06:12:52] <Kambfhase> If you have one global event handler, that's faster than setting up 999 single ones
[06:13:01] <Hartimer> motaka2: $("#table_id :input").attr("disabled", "disabled")
[06:13:32] <motaka2> Hartimer: Thanks
[06:15:13] <Hartimer> my page has to check with the server if new items are available, and if so, get them and append them to the current table/container/whatever
[06:15:30] <Hartimer> i have this working already, with a 10 second time interval
[06:16:07] <Hartimer> but I have a problem... sometimes, when a user inserts a new item, that item not always is returned by the "background" function
[06:16:36] <Hartimer> I'm gessing this is a timestamp or concurrency issue, but haven't found any resources about it... can anyone help me?
[06:17:08] <Hartimer> the "background" function uses .setTimeout to run every 10 seconds after the previous call ended
[06:18:05] <Iszak> why not use setInterval?
[06:18:34] <Kambfhase> setInterval is wrong, when the net delay is bigger than 10s
[06:18:44] <black_warlock> nFFF : without .live the code wont work
[06:19:01] <Iszak> Kambfhase: wrong? how so?
[06:19:03] <Hartimer> Iszak: its kind of irrelevant... i tried setinterval and settimeout, i prefer settimeout because it only starts counting after the previous call finished
[06:19:03] <black_warlock> if the html is generated from jq source
[06:19:13] <Hartimer> so no concurrent requests occur
[06:19:22] <Iszak> I don't know what you're even trying to do.
[06:19:29] <Iszak> but by the sounds of it, yes setTimeout is what you want.
[06:19:31] <Kambfhase> Iszak: becaus you send the second request before the first has already returned!
[06:19:34] <Hartimer> see facebook feed?
[06:19:41] <Hartimer> which updates every so often?
[06:19:47] <Hartimer> same logic
[06:19:51] <nFFF> black_warlock ?
[06:19:52] <nFFF> which code
[06:20:09] <Hartimer> but when i "update my status", the update function not always returns that update
[06:20:12] <black_warlock> the html code
[06:20:24] <black_warlock> var MyFeed = MyFeed + "<br /><h1 cl
[06:20:24] <Hartimer> I'm just trying to figure out the best strategies to do such thing
[06:20:26] <nFFF> url?
[06:20:28] <Kambfhase> Hartimer: how do you update your status?
[06:20:42] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/udrej/21/
[06:20:53] <Kambfhase> I mean, this sound more like a serverside error to me.
[06:20:56] <Hartimer> Kambfhase: post to server and then the update function puts it in the dashboard
[06:21:00] <Hartimer> like a normal update
[06:21:04] <black_warlock> i have tested this script on 4 different browsers and it works fine
[06:21:29] <Hartimer> Kambfhase: the post is posted, and if a refresh the page (which causes a new refresh with a clean timestamp) the post is there
[06:21:32] <black_warlock> im just missing the rollback to summary
[06:21:40] <black_warlock> dunno how to make it
[06:22:11] <nFFF> black_warlock, live got replaced by on()
[06:22:12] <Kambfhase> Ok, and after the refresh, the updaded status is missing in the stream?
[06:22:16] <nFFF> iirc
[06:22:23] <Hartimer> no, it's there....
[06:22:39] <Hartimer> only sometimes the update function doesn't get it, and i don't know why..
[06:22:53] <Hartimer> maybe a bit os pastebin will help
[06:23:00] <Hartimer> *of
[06:27:09] <Hartimer> the update function http://pastebin.com/DgWrTV47
[06:28:19] <Hartimer> the form that posts http://pastebin.com/ZFBN1SvX
[06:28:23] <Hartimer> and that's it
[06:31:54] <Kambfhase> That code looks OK to me.
[06:32:18] <Hartimer> it works fine... no server erros, no javascript errors (Chrome console)
[06:32:28] <Hartimer> it seems to be my pull strategy...
[06:32:29] <domcat> can you recommend a smooth scroll plugin that can scroll to the seciton when linked from another page? (onload) I need it to use with WP. thanks
[06:32:57] <motaka2> Hello I use this code to disable some form elements but it doesnt work , what the problem would be?   http://pastebin.com/WmimYnu5
[06:33:13] <Hartimer> that's why i'm asking for some pointers about it... maybe the timestamp of the update functions is being set to early... maybe transations need to be set up on the server side..
[06:34:09] <motaka2> Hartimer: ?
[06:34:19] <DerekPioneer> i have an multi-dimensional array that looks like "var json = {"forum":[{"id":"1","created":"2010-03-19 "}}} only a lot deeper and bigger. every time the user interacts with the array 1 or 2 variables in this array are changed. i would like to log all the changes to this array so i can allow the user to have an "undo" button. where do i start?
[06:34:56] <Kambfhase> motaka2: "Doesnt work" is not a valid problem description
[06:35:53] <motaka2> Kambfhase: It must disable an input with the name id_inds_equips_electricity , but it doesnt, So I wonder why is that ?
[06:36:26] <Kambfhase> what kind of form element is #has-energy-teams ?
[06:37:32] <black_warlock> jsfiddle is dead
[06:38:27] <black_warlock> it takes 5 mins to save
[06:39:19] <black_warlock> there is pro acocunt on jsfiddle ? i think they need some moneys.......for servers and band
[06:39:22] <Kambfhase> jsfiddle is the twitter of the paste bins. totally awesome, but has some heavy load problems
[06:39:37] <black_warlock> i think is traffic problems
[06:39:47] <Kambfhase> still, it sucks
[06:39:54] <Kambfhase> ^^
[06:40:00] <black_warlock> it is the best paste tool i have seen
[06:40:09] <motaka2> Kambfhase: it is <select>
[06:41:58] <Kambfhase> try putting the 1 in parens, not sure that'll fiy it though
[06:42:16] <apeiros_> hi there. small question: in plugins, I often see ";(function($) { … })(jQuery);". I understand the "(function($) {…})(jQuery);", but why the ";" in front?
[06:43:19] <Kambfhase> apeiros_: some people merge mutiple JS-files into one for better loading performance.
[06:43:31] <Kambfhase> the ; is just a safe guard
[06:43:59] <apeiros_> Kambfhase: ok. but that's only for the case somebody forgot the last ; in another file?
[06:44:31] <Kambfhase> yeah, some minifying tools remove the last ;
[06:44:42] <apeiros_> oh, ew.
[06:44:50] <apeiros_> ok, get it then. thanks for the info :)
[06:46:10] <apeiros_> another question: given I generate a piece of html code and insert it into the dom, is there a callback that gets fired when all assets referenced by that piece of html have been loaded? (e.g. images)
[06:46:12] <Kambfhase> np
[06:46:55] <Kambfhase> dunno, Dom change events are not standardized
[06:46:58] <black_warlock> hell why it doesnt work ?
[06:46:59] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/udrej/30/
[06:47:20] <black_warlock> the toggle wont let me set back the summary
[06:48:14] <nFFF> black_warlock, you mean hide the content?
[06:48:37] <black_warlock> the last 2 lines outside the loop
[06:48:43] <black_warlock> $(this)
[06:48:49] <Joeytje50> hey, I made a function where I have a <button> which becomes disabled="disabled", then the <span> within that button ('button span') animates ({opacity:'0'}) then ({opacity:'1'}) and then the <button> gets the disable attribute removed
[06:48:53] <nFFF> you click the title -> content shows, you click title again content should hide?
[06:48:57] <black_warlock> if i click title the article shows up
[06:49:03] <Joeytje50> the problem is that the button gets the disabe attribute removed immediately
[06:49:11] <black_warlock> but if i re-click the article doesnt close
[06:49:18] <nFFF> yes
[06:49:25] <black_warlock> aye the summary comes back
[06:49:45] <Joeytje50> is there some way to let jquery do something after a certain amount of ms?
[06:50:19] <black_warlock> so you was saying var MyFeed = MyFeed+ can be written as var MyFeed =+ ?
[06:50:31] <Kambfhase> ?mda setTimeout @ Joeytje50
[06:50:33] <motaka2> Kambfhase: I didnt get what I should do , would you pls help me figure that out

[06:50:52] <apeiros_> Kambfhase: ok, thanks. btw., any special reason it's kamBf instead of kamPf?
[06:51:58] <Kambfhase> apeiros_: no, but its unique on the web, so I use it
[06:52:00] <Joeytje50> Kambfhase: but I mean within the jquery statement, like $('button').attr('disabled','disabled').children().animate({opacity:'0'},500).animate({opacity:'1'},500).parent().removeAttr('disabled')
[06:52:11] <Kambfhase> setTimeout(fn, 1000)
[06:52:16] <Kambfhase> sorry, link was wrong
[06:52:28] <apeiros_> heh
[06:52:34] <motaka2> Kambfhase: ?
[06:52:35] <Kambfhase> where fn is a name of a function
[06:53:07] <Joeytje50> Kambfhase: is there a way to do something after the animations are finished, without needing to use setTimeout?
[06:54:08] <Kambfhase> .animate() takes a complete parameter: A function to call once the animation is complete. ?see animate
[06:54:33] <Joeytje50> ?see animate
[06:54:35] <bot-t> Joeytje50, .stop() - Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/

[06:55:34] <Xotix> hi
[06:55:39] <gnagno> hello all
[06:55:42] <Xotix> hi
[06:56:24] <black_warlock> i was thinking a way to cut out the feed reader
[06:56:54] <gnagno> is it possible to do something like this? http://pastie.org/3327909
[06:57:28] <nFFF> black_warlock, what is content_hide actually od?
[06:57:31] <nFFF> do*
[06:57:45] <black_warlock> its used to open the full article
[06:57:51] <gnagno> in my code I would like to raise a new event called "page_changed" passing it the current page, and then catch it from an event handler and do something
[06:58:05] <black_warlock> i setted it hidden because on toggle it shows and the other .content hide
[06:59:28] <black_warlock> to make the reader lighter, i have decided to never call the content till its requested
[07:00:03] <black_warlock> you can change it if you dont need it
[07:00:12] <black_warlock> maybe shall use only .content div
[07:01:44] <black_warlock> the += doesnt work
[07:04:18] <black_warlock> this is lol
[07:04:56] <Xotix> i have $(this).on("dblclick", '.editor-img', function() { console.log())); why does console.log gets called twice?
[07:05:07] <black_warlock> waaaa
[07:05:09] <black_warlock> i did it
[07:05:52] <black_warlock> yeaaaa
[07:05:54] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/udrej/41/
[07:05:57] <black_warlock> im done
[07:06:01] <black_warlock> =)
[07:06:26] <nFFF> :>>
[07:06:33] <nFFF> jsfiddle is so slow today
[07:06:34] <black_warlock> hehehe
[07:06:54] <black_warlock> i have just moved the other function inside the first toggle function
[07:07:04] <black_warlock> $(this).next('.content').toggle('fast' ,function(){ $(this).next().first('.content_hide').html(entry.content).toggle('fast');});
[07:07:13] <Kambfhase> we need a node.js-bitorrent-git-based ditributed jsFiddle
[07:07:38] <black_warlock> fantastic !
[07:07:53] <black_warlock> .on() works
[07:08:04] <black_warlock> and its optimized reader
[07:08:16] <black_warlock> because the articles are called only when requested
[07:08:19] <Taloncor> Is there any way to prevent the ajax:error event from being fired when i abort a request?
[07:08:39] <hurry> hi guys, i have an ajax call , i populate a div with beforeSend with loading, and in success a replace with "ok", but i didn't see "ok,... why?
[07:08:47] <hurry> without before i see ok
[07:10:01] <Hartimer> hurry do you happen to replace the content of the HTML, therefore removing the element with the id where you put "ok"?
[07:10:14] <Hartimer> (happened to me before :S )
[07:13:25] <hurry> Hartimer: i have beforeSend finction with   $("#risposta").replaceWith("sending...");  and Complete with    $("#risposta").replaceWith("OK");
[07:13:41] <hurry> but i don't see ok(sorry for my english)
[07:13:50] <nFFF> yes
[07:14:27] <Hartimer> hurry: what is "#risposta"? div? td?
[07:14:39] <hurry> div id
[07:14:48] <nFFF> hurry, success:  $("#risposta").replaceWith("OK"); ?
[07:14:54] <Hartimer> don't use "replaceWith", try .html
[07:15:15] <nFFF> try $("#risposta").text().replaceWith
[07:15:23] <Hartimer> or that
[07:15:28] <hurry> nFFF: yes it's works
[07:15:49] <hurry> when i must use replaceWith?
[07:16:02] <nFFF> $("#risposta").text().replaceWith("ok");
[07:16:42] <Hartimer> when you want the original html with that ID to disappear and be replace with new html (in your case "sending..."
[07:17:34] <hurry> nFFF:  dosen't works  replaceWith is not function
[07:17:38] <hurry> Hartimer: it's my case no?
[07:17:54] <xec_> nFFF: .text() returns string...
[07:17:55] <nFFF> actually you don't need replace with
[07:17:57] <Hartimer> no, you want to change what is inside
[07:18:33] <xec_> nFFF: you can't call jquery methods on strings
[07:18:34] <hurry> Hartimer: ah ok, thanks guys
[07:18:43] <nFFF> xec_, can you do: $("#risposta").text("ok");
[07:18:50] <Ponchale> hi
[07:18:51] <nFFF> will that replace or just append
[07:18:53] <Ponchale> hallo
[07:18:56] <Ponchale> hola
[07:19:13] <xec_> nFFF: yes but you cant do .text().replaceWith("ok") like you just wrote :P
[07:19:26] <nFFF> Yea I figured that
[07:19:32] <nFFF> <nFFF> actually you don't need replace with
[07:19:32] <nFFF> <xec_> nFFF: .text() returns string...
[07:20:02] <SeanLazer> hey guys, i'm organizing my jquery into object-literals wherever possible and i was wondering if anyone could tell me if there's a preferred way to handle executing e.preventDefault(); in these situations
[07:20:06] <SeanLazer> here's my two style examples: https://gist.github.com/1752632
[07:20:31] <xec_> 16:16 <nFFF> $("#risposta").text().replaceWith("ok"); <-- w00t
[07:21:07] <nFFF> Yea, then I figured it was wrong and corrected my ways :D
[07:22:41] <Ponchale> i need help
[07:22:59] <SeanLazer> nobody in here has an opinion on code style and practices?
[07:23:03] <Ponchale> need help with scroll the combobox
[07:25:04] <andrew9183> hey guys, i'm just thinking out of my mind here, but is there a way to grab image headers to show a thumbnail of the image without grabbing the entire image with an ajax load ?
[07:26:08] <Hartimer> andrew9183: i don't know the best way to do that.. what i've seen done is have the server side resize the image on the fly, depending on the address/parameters passed
[07:26:19] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I am getting an error "An invalid or illegal string was specified" when the webserver returns an xhtml page with content_type application/xhtml+xml
[07:27:01] <SmokeyD> but when I change the content type on the server to text/html the error disappears and jquery inserts stuff into the DOM fine
[07:27:19] <Rob_Feature> can anyone tell me why this VERY simple jquery doesn't work in IE8: http://pastebin.com/kk9aiVFe (I can provide a link to the live site if you want to see it)
[07:27:23] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: It probably means your XHTML page isn't well-formed XML.
[07:27:25] <SmokeyD> I validated the xhtml against a w3c validator (by manually pasting) and it is valid xhtml
[07:27:32] <andrew9183> ah i see! i wanted to know if there was a clean easy way without doing server stuff,
[07:27:37] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, it is, I validated it with w3c
[07:29:01] <domcat> how to disable going to #anchor when opening url directly?
[07:29:57] <Fenweru> I can't see to print out my validation errors using form_error, the following does not return anything: http://pastebin.com/sHuVPzXj
[07:29:59] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Do you get any errors when viewing the page served up as application/xhtml+xml?
[07:30:07] <Fenweru> oops sorry
[07:30:44] <andrew9183> thanks Hartimer
[07:35:08] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, when I view the page served up as text/html there is no problem. Jquery (the jqgrid plugin actually) works fine. But when the page is served up as application/xhtml+xml I get the jquery error
[07:36:21] <Hartimer> domcat: $("#anchor").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); //do whatever });
[07:36:38] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Sorry, I misunderstood before. Not enough coffee… Does the error you're getting tell you what the invalid/illegal string is?
[07:36:55] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, no, unfortunately it doesn't
[07:37:28] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Also, may I ask why you're serving the page as application/xhtml+xml in the first place? Most of the time it's not necessary.
[07:38:33] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, there are some custom xml tags in there with my own namespace that a client app (which uses a proxy before passing the xml to the browser) is rendering first. That client proxy app parses the page as xml
[07:40:15] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Ahh, okay. Are the custom XML tags making it to the browser in your testing setup? Just a guess, but maybe jQuery is ignoring them when served as text, but choking on them when served as app/xml.
[07:46:08] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, no,  right now in the test I am doing, the custom xml tags aren't present. Just the xmlns declaration, but not the tags.
[07:49:15] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Yeah, sorry, but I'm at the limit of my knowledge. Content disposition isn't something I have to worry much about these days.
[07:51:26] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: It might be useful to narrow it down to whether it's something jQuery specific, or JS in general that's choking. If you haven't already.
[07:52:13] * _unary doh
[07:52:49] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, I have pasted info on http://pastebin.com/7Hs5gCH4
[07:53:21] <SmokeyD> it shows the exact line in query-1.7.js where the error occurs, and the content of the variables at which the error occurs.
[07:53:59] <CharlieM751> so I have a function that fires on a focus event, but it only seems to fire some of the time, any idea why that could be?
[07:54:01] <JAAulde> Does jQuery UI 1.8.14 support the position object as a value for the position option of a dialog?
[07:59:33] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: One problem I do see is that there's an id="1" in the pasted code. Is that something in your rendered source? Because an ID can't start with a number.
[08:01:03] <snover> warrenparsons: it can in html5
[08:01:43] <warrenparsons> snover: I did not know that. However, this is XHTML being served as application/xhtml+xml
[08:01:49] <snover> ugh. why.
[08:02:17] <warrenparsons> snover: SmokeyD is doing some intermediate parsing voodoo. He could better explain.
[08:02:28] <snover> there’s never a good reason for application/xhtml+xml
[08:03:20] <Guest67965> hello
[08:03:48] <SmokeyD> snover, there are custom xml tags in there with my own namespace, that are parsed by a client side proxy application before passing everything to the browser
[08:04:29] <SmokeyD> the xml tags aren't there currently, but they will be, so I am testing application/xhtml+xml output first
[08:04:49] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, hmm, an ID can't start with a number?
[08:05:00] <SmokeyD> That might be it maybe. I will check that out. Thanks
[08:05:02] <warrenparsons> SmokeyD: Not prior to HTML5, and probably in no flavor of XML ever.
[08:05:17] <SmokeyD> warrenparsons, ok.
[08:06:00] <warrenparsons> snover: Thanks for the HTML5 ID tip. That could come in handy.
[08:07:28] <aqeel> hi room
[08:07:45] <aqeel> $("#menuclassic").height($(window).height());.....not giving the height?
[08:08:56] <aqeel> the item indeed has float left assigned though....
[08:09:38] <warrenparsons> aqeel: What kind of element is #menuclassic?
[08:09:57] <aqeel> how can i for this element p to have the heioght of window...
[08:10:07] <aqeel> p
[08:10:29] <student1> cant i have a id name like 'test%20' ?
[08:10:52] <aqeel> yes but refrain from characters better
[08:11:10] <student1> aqeel for some reason jquery cant find that element
[08:11:11] <aqeel> alphanumeric is better...
[08:11:30] <aqeel> how?
[08:11:35] <Gozzy> student1 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70579/what-are-valid-values-for-the-id-attribute-in-html
[08:11:46] <student1> aqeel, i have to use that as i need to make ids out of literal html text
[08:12:07] <student1> ok
[08:12:14] <Gozzy> i dont think % is allowed
[08:12:28] <student1> ok,
[08:12:49] <student1> maybe i could do a regex and replace % with something and then reconvert it later?
[08:13:07] <warrenparsons> student1: That's what I would do.
[08:13:40] <student1> ok, thanks
[08:13:41] <warrenparsons> student1: I'd probably just replace the space itself, or the entire %20 entity if needed.
[08:14:42] <aqeel> how can i get the entire window height on element p who also has float left assigned...
[08:15:09] <aqeel> i can't seem to have this working...
[08:15:26] <Gozzy> aqeel #css
[08:15:29] <aqeel> $("#containerclassic").width($(window).width()-40);....this works perfect...
[08:15:44] <aqeel> this is width...
[08:15:49] <aqeel> height not working
[08:16:07] <aqeel> ok let me fiddle it...
[08:17:48] <Dr4g> I'm building a web application and require nice clean jQuery sortable CSS example. I'm using Twitter Bootstrap for the UI of the application but bootstrap doesn't have a clean sortable example. So i'm here to see if theres any recommendations? :-) Thanks.
[08:17:57] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/W9yGL/
[08:18:08] <aqeel> here it is
[08:19:58] <Know1edge1> is there a way to name your delegates so that you can undelegate by name later?
[08:20:02] <Pilate> Dr4g: bootstrap recommends a table sorter
[08:20:49] <Pilate> or used to... i guess not now
[08:20:50] <warrenparsons> Know1edge1: Event namespacing might work for you. $('#elm1').on('click.myNameSpace', ....
[08:20:57] <jedimind> http://tympanus.net/Development/3DGallery/ fancy
[08:21:37] <Gozzy> aqeel thats a typical css question, ask over there :)
[08:21:38] <warrenparsons> Know1edge1: Then later $('#elm1').off('click.myNameSpace');
[08:21:53] <Know1edge1> thanks warrenparsons
[08:21:55] <Dr4g> Pilate: i wasn't referring to Sortable Tables, i'm referring to jQuery sortable lists, with drag-and-drop functionality.
[08:21:55] <Know1edge1> just what i needed
[08:22:10] <aqeel> jquery?
[08:26:55] <aqeel> why is it width is working and not height
[08:29:59] <standard12> Has anyon ever used jquery for a slider...not an image slider but sliding for example #div1 #div2 #div3, etc
[08:33:17] <risky_s> I am having problems with my menu in IE 7 and 8? Any help?
[08:33:25] <Know1edge1> anyone know of a way to get the selector of the current clicked item?
[08:33:30] <Know1edge1> i know firebug has $1
[08:34:32] <standard12> .is()
[08:34:33] <standard12> ?
[08:35:13] <risky_s> my background image for my menu does not appear in IE7 or IE8
[08:35:29] <standard12> check the path
[08:35:46] <risky_s> path is correct, the menu works in IE9
[08:35:56] <standard12> link?
[08:36:09] <risky_s> its currently local
[08:36:19] <standard12> could be a number of things
[08:36:23] <risky_s> is post css in jsfiddle
[08:36:51] <risky_s> http://jsfiddle.net/EqBh7/
[08:37:28] <nFFF> #css? :>
[08:37:40] <nFFF> Know1edge1, what do you mean?
[08:37:46] <nFFF> firebug is a debugger, jQuery is a framework
[08:37:58] <standard12> try background-image:
[08:38:03] <standard12> instead of background:
[08:38:06] <risky_s> yer i tried that didnt work
[08:38:14] <Know1edge1> nFFF: I know. I'm trying to get the selector used to trigger a click event
[08:38:40] <Know1edge1> with firebug, you can use $1 to get it, so i was trying to find a way in jquery
[08:38:59] <nFFF> $(this) ?
[08:39:04] <Know1edge1> that said .selector should do it, but im using * as my selector
[08:39:20] <Know1edge1> nFFF: no the actual selector
[08:39:25] <Know1edge1> class, id, whatever
[08:39:29] <Know1edge1> for event bubbling
[08:40:57] <standard12> do those elements have any other styles attatched
[08:41:49] <risky_s> they do have a jquery code that changes the image when hover
[08:42:25] <standard12> try commenting it out and see if it works
[08:45:18] <student1> is it possible to do regex in replace? such as str = str.replace("AB"+[A-Z],"") ?
[08:46:11] <FinalAngel> does $(el).remove(); also remove all events attached to the element?
[08:46:57] <ajpiano> FinalAngel: yes
[08:47:02] <FinalAngel> ty
[08:47:03] <ajpiano> if you don't want that to happen use .detach instead
[08:47:11] <FinalAngel> yep, just wanted to be sure
[08:47:57] <romsok> Hi, this is probably a noob question
[08:48:10] <romsok> but I can't get selectable widget to work
[08:48:22] <standard12> have any of you used, or know of, some kind of auto-div-slider? not an image slider, I just want content to slide
[08:48:23] <Kambfhase> student1: str.replace(/AB[A-Z]/gi, "")
[08:48:34] <romsok> "button" widget works
[08:48:38] <student1> ty
[08:48:45] <romsok> so it's not a question of importing the files
[08:48:48] <Dan_Wilson_> I'm having an issue with a $.getJSON() call. It seems this call adds two parameters to the get request. One of the parameters, is expected by the API I am using, the other (the _ parameter) is not and is causing the API to fail due to unexpected parameters. Is there a way I can turn off the _ parameter or is it needed somehow (like an Async token?) Here is the request parameters I refer to. &callback=jQuery171032178770910973464_1328131932

[08:57:38] <jLearner> hey
[08:59:00] <romsok> alright
[08:59:06] <romsok> I'll work on demo
[08:59:11] <jLearner> I'd like to provide templates plus a small designer where the user can change the position, the content of the labels and textboxes a bit. Whats the best way to do this? My problem is rather the positioning (drag 'n drop) than changing the values. Thx in advance
[09:01:07] <Surrealis> I have a div block which is set to display: none yet it is still returning true for .is(':visible')
[09:01:18] <Surrealis> any ideas?
[09:02:02] <sphinxxx> can anyone tell me why the jsonp callback function isn't firing here?  http://jsfiddle.net/mVvGV/
[09:02:39] <Surrealis> i've tried hiding it via .hide() as well and it is hidden on the browser yet returning true for .is("v:isible")
[09:03:33] <jLearner> Surrealis, why dont you get .css('display') and then check if none or not?
[09:04:34] <cybersholt> sphinxxx why not attach to the to the success function like this ,   success: function( data ) {     if (console && console.log){       console.log( 'Sample of data:', data.slice(0,100) );     }
[09:04:39] <JAAulde> Does jQuery UI 1.8.14 support the position object as a value for the position option of a dialog?
[09:06:01] <WebDragon> http://youtu.be/1cOxlhpoHAg  zombie boot camp. Now you know where all those guys at your last seminar got their training ;)
[09:07:34] <sphinxxx> cybersholt: thanks a lot , that works
[09:09:00] <cybersholt> no problem
[09:09:18] <cybersholt> its also good to have a failure callback too
[09:10:28] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone knows how to do animation with variables same way as the first example on http://api.jquery.com/animate/ ? "left: '+=50' "
[09:11:22] <K3|Chris|Work> replace 50 with a variable basically, I tried the same syntax and it doesn't work
[09:11:38] <Taloncor> Are they any actively maintained history-plugins beside balupton/History.js?
[09:13:01] <student1> is it possible to create a regexp with a varaible? such that its dynamic
[09:13:55] <student1> smthg like => re = new RegExp(myvar/[A-Z]/);
[09:15:21] <student1> got it, had to escape with \\{
[09:21:06] <cybersholt> wow its surprisingly quiet in here
[09:25:22] <Ukyo> why would  $("form").submit(function(){ effect all forms on the page, and not just he one named 'form' ?
[09:26:11] <Taloncor> Ukyo: Because your selector specifies "Select all <form>-tags"
[09:26:45] <Ukyo> hwo do I select the specific form named 'form' ?
[09:26:48] <Ukyo> or otherwise
[09:26:54] <Taloncor> Ukyo: $("[name='form']")
[09:27:00] <Ukyo> thank you
[09:29:34] <student1> new RegExp('\\{'+myVar+'\\}[YN];');
[09:29:54] <student1> this doesnt give error but also doesnt work with str.replace(r,"");
[09:30:01] <Surrealis> okay i think i figured this out does .is(':visible') know about the containing div blocks?
[09:30:02] <webPragmatist> what are reasons a .submit( might be called twice?
[09:30:23] <Surrealis> if i have nested tables and divs and check if a child which is visible = true but the parent is hidden
[09:30:31] <Kambfhase> student1: try new RegExp(myVar+"[YN]")
[09:30:32] <Surrealis> will isvisible return true or false
[09:31:26] <student1> wow, that was super easy :(
[09:31:43] <Kambfhase> :)
[09:32:50] <matteo_> ciao
[09:32:53] <matteo_> !list
[09:33:10] <matteo_> 1list
[09:33:16] <matteo_> !list
[09:34:54] <Surrealis> does :visible take into account the parent container?
[09:36:57] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/3xk1lef2uxdulolcw02rdq
[09:37:03] <webPragmatist> ^^ why would that submit twice?
[09:37:32] <webPragmatist> or alter twice even

[09:43:21] <zef88> Hello, how can I change a div's background-image to another image I have preloaded with javascript?
[09:45:16] <nFFF> zef88, .css
[09:45:41] <snover> zef88: you’re doing it wrong.
[09:45:53] <nFFF> $('.classname').css('background-image','http://blah.com/image.jpeg');
[09:46:58] <zef88> If i do .css I cannot use a preloaded image
[09:47:17] <nFFF> wheres the image preloaded?
[09:47:25] <zef88> I preloaded it with javascript
[09:47:37] <nFFF> upload your code to jsfiddle.net
[09:47:38] <zef88> a = new Image; a.src = "image.png";
[09:48:21] <snover> zef88: don’t do that. what are you trying to do? a rollover?
[09:48:56] <zef88> No, I'm trying to change the background of a div when a button is clicked, but have the current background replaced with another one that was preloaded
[09:49:50] <K3|Chris|Work> if (parseInt($(this).parent().find("ul").css('left')) - (window.ItemWidth * 1.5) + parseInt($(this).parent().find("ul").css('width')) <= $(this).parent().width())  <--- I just wrote that, and even I'm not sure why it works
[09:51:53] <zef88> is there a way? :(
[09:52:02] <Surrealis> nfff yeah i try that out
[09:52:16] <nFFF> zef88, I don't udnerstadn, why using the css won't work
[09:52:17] <Surrealis> i've got very obvious conficts here
[09:52:26] <Surrealis> i have everything coming back as visible
[09:52:26] <nFFF> The image will alreayd be loaded into cache
[09:52:34] <nFFF> and the css won';t reload it?
[09:52:40] <nFFF> it'll use the cache
[09:52:40] <Surrealis> and the div/tables are clearly not visible
[09:52:51] <zef88> nFFF: oh, hadn't thought about that
[09:52:54] <Surrealis> and they are being set invisible by jquery
[09:52:57] <keirlav87> if i pass groups of elements over to the server as arrays like so -> name="ele["+i+"][]"
[09:53:04] <zef88> nFFF: thanks :P
[09:53:25] <keirlav87> will that create an array of which contains arrays of ele[0][]. ele[1][] etc?
[09:53:26] <Surrealis> so im guessing i have some order or operation issue or something
[09:53:46] <eddiemonge> keirlav87: yes
[09:54:00] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ Surrealis
[09:54:00] <bot-t> Surrealis, Try It And See
[09:55:16] <Surrealis> i have been, on super simple, one activty pass throughs, yes, it works fine.
[09:56:08] <aqeel> yippyyyyyyyyy got the height to work
[09:56:13] <keirlav87> so would each nested arrays post var be ele[/index/][]?
[09:56:55] <Surrealis> it is a tad more complex, when i can see the display: hidden on the div block, which is dynamicly added by jquery yet 4 functions later i'm getting visible = true.
[09:58:16] <nFFF> Surrealis, upload your code block to jsfiddle.net
[10:15:29] <ezioa> in the interest of sizing the columns in datatable, anyone know if this is the correct way to define an aoColumns object  { "mDataProp": blah, "sWidth" : "150px" }
[10:32:02] <eddiemonge> ezioa: everything you said is gibberish to me
[10:32:47] <someprimetime> how can I hide a radio button?
[10:32:49] <ezioa> eddiemonge, it will only make sense to those who know jquery
[10:32:52] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/7/
[10:33:29] <Kambfhase> .hide() ?
[10:33:48] <eddiemonge> ezioa: oh sorry. i guess i dont know jquery. sorry, its my first day
[10:33:54] <someprimetime> oh, actually, duh
[10:34:19] <ezioa> eddiemonge, errr.... those who know datatables
[10:34:37] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: i like how you cache $(this) and then almost completely ignore it
[10:34:54] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: lol this is just hacked together right now
[10:34:56] <someprimetime> i'll clean it up later
[10:35:01] <someprimetime> i just wanted to get it working first
[10:35:16] <Kambfhase> extreme programming?
[10:35:18] <eddiemonge> and you really should remember the quotes: find('input[type="radio"]')
[10:35:31] <ezioa> eddiemonge, datatables has a distinct way to define some things
[10:35:36] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: thanks mate
[10:36:08] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: what are you trying to do exactly? hide the radios and use the books as the buttons instead?
[10:36:31] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: this is just a replacement to use icons for radio buttons instead of the normal browser defaults
[10:38:20] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: can you make them hidden inputs then?
[10:38:59] <someprimetime> i mean, i could, but then wouldn't it suck for those w/o javascript?
[10:41:36] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: thats why you do it in js
[10:41:52] <eddiemonge> look at how jqui does it for buttons
[10:42:06] <dAnjou> hi, when i want to react on an anchor in the URL, do i have to parse it myself or is there some kind of event?
[10:42:12] <someprimetime> ok thanks
[10:42:34] <chee> someprimetime: there is a plugin for that that i have used before
[10:42:36] <eddiemonge> ezioa: gotta say im not impressed with dataTables site or documentation. the plugin seems ok but everything else is lacking
[10:42:44] <eddiemonge> like where is the code? no github link?
[10:42:47] <someprimetime> chee: yeah, but i kinda just want to do it myself
[10:42:53] <chee> someprimetime: i understand :3
[10:43:19] <eddiemonge> dAnjou: window.location.hash
[10:43:39] <dAnjou> so parsing .. thanks
[10:43:47] <ezioa> eddiemonge, it's pretty good but when my column sizing wasn't working(which i know why that was now), it didn't show the whole object for aoColumns and I even went through a couple discussions where people had similar problems
[10:44:00] <ezioa> i understand what their problems are now and in doing so understand what went wrong
[10:44:27] <chee> someprimetime: here is what i might do
[10:44:33] <chee> someprimetime: if i was writing it
[10:46:21] <chee> someprimetime: put each radio button in a container that has over flow hidden, and use modernizr to detect JS
[10:46:47] <chee> someprimetime: if they have no js leave it alone, if they have js position your icon where the radio button would go, leave the label where it is
[10:47:06] <chee> someprimetime: and move the button to the left 20 or so pixels, so it was outide of the container
[10:47:11] <chee> someprimetime: that's what i might do
[10:47:39] <chee> so people without js get a radio button, and people with js get a sexy book/green tick combo
[10:47:48] <eddiemonge> what i would do is, detect if there is js, if so, replace the radio with a hidden input with the same params and then position the icon where you want it
[10:48:00] <someprimetime> chee: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/C5C2x/9/ ?
[10:48:02] <yedimind> eddiemonge, the detecting for js is redundant
[10:48:06] <yedimind> as it'll just be a radio by default until js kicks in
[10:49:41] <eddiemonge> yeah i know but i was countering chee
[10:49:48] <phatboi> i did $("div.endpoint[data-endpoint-name=aqua sphere]") and it's returning a shit ton of objects, but i only have one item with data-endpoint-name of aquasphere
[10:50:02] <phatboi> and the shit ton was metric, of course
[10:50:25] <eddiemonge> phatboi: you need quotes around the aqua sphere
[10:50:34] <eddiemonge> otherwise that is one invalid selector
[10:50:45] <phatboi> eddiemonge: you are the man
[10:50:59] <phatboi> i'm used to css selectors :P
[10:51:58] <eddiemonge> css selectors need the "" too
[10:52:17] <phatboi> no, they dont

[11:06:54] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/TMh24/4/
[11:07:02] <someprimetime> you need to wrap it inside a selectable id

[11:09:02] <arcticseal> Hey guys.  I've written a very simple function with parameters.  In my document.ready I've attempted to use this function inside the .click() event.  However, it does absolutely nothing when I click on the .  If I called the function in firebug, everything works just great.  Can someone take a look at my code http://pastebin.com/Tcafu0yZ and tell me what stupid thing I'm doing wrong?
[11:09:41] <Ricardo_Martins> guys.. im having trouble to use .animate() function... It works with jquery-1.4.2 but doesnt work with jquery-1.7.1 (just changing the src). Does anyone knows why?
[11:10:11] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: its probably something else in your code. a lot has changed. does your console show any errors?
[11:10:47] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: nope. i'll try to enable some warnings on the console too
[11:13:10] <romsok> @someprimetime thanks!
[11:13:20] <someprimetime> np
[11:14:24] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: no errors logged
[11:14:38] <eddiemonge> romsok: not true. it was working fine how you had it. you didnt have any css applied to it. cc someprimetime http://jsfiddle.net/TMh24/7/
[11:14:43] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: we tried it on two different sites...
[11:14:48] <YogSototh> http://www.darian-brown.com/pass-a-php-array-to-javascript-as-json-using-ajax-and-json_encode/ - can this method be combined with getting data out of a MySQL database?
[11:15:02] <Ricardo_Martins> one of them was using 1.4 too and working. changed to 1.7, and no way
[11:15:04] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: word yeah listen to eddiemonge
[11:16:28] <someprimetime> YogSototh: that's normally how you'd do it… you get an array from a database table, use php's json_encode function passing in the array (usually done within a controller)
[11:16:49] <someprimetime> have your ajax call that controller with a get() request and then json_decode it

[11:24:55] <eddiemonge> why?
[11:25:06] <someprimetime> why is a) the radio button not hidden completely and b) it looking like it's getting clicked on for each one

[11:27:55] <Eviltwin> And yes, it was positioning
[11:28:28] <someprimetime> oh, son of a gun
[11:28:30] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin
[11:29:04] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: i put the error on jsfiddle... http://jsfiddle.net/BeNG6/   - load it with 1.7.1 and load with 1.4.3
[11:29:12] <Ricardo_Martins> or 1.4.4
[11:29:27] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: your if ( click ) confuses me
[11:29:54] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: what about it? just a bad way to do it or what?
[11:30:26] <Eviltwin> It doesn't seem to do anything...
[11:30:38] <Eviltwin> It's like if(true);
[11:31:00] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: whoa. thats not simplified at all. you have some errors in there. like trying to use .css() as an animate to start
[11:31:02] <Eviltwin> And because it's absolutely silly
[11:31:08] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ someprimetime
[11:31:09] <bot-t> someprimetime, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:31:22] <someprimetime> oh, you're right
[11:31:28] <someprimetime> that doesn't make sense
[11:31:29] <someprimetime> haha
[11:31:36] <Eviltwin> Also .parent().parent() is usually a bad call
[11:31:37] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: also, animates with 0 durations arent animates at all
[11:31:44] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: see ?closest
[11:31:44] <bot-t> someprimetime, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:32:05] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks i'll start using closest more
[11:32:11] <someprimetime> since that's the second time you've told me to do so.
[11:32:13] <someprimetime> ;)
[11:32:16] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: and you are wrapping a doc.ready() block in a doc.ready() block
[11:32:42] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: but if i just comment the ready(function()) entirely, the rest also doesnt work.
[11:33:07] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: ok.. i'll try to delete one
[11:34:14] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: if i simply try to type on console an animate command its not working for 1.7.1
[11:34:27] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: neither if i dont add any of these js you saw
[11:35:04] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: also you might not want to hide the radio button. they sometimes dont submit their value when hidden
[11:35:34] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: oh, really? weird.. alright i'll just maybe z-index it?
[11:36:51] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: your second if is pointless too since you already know its a radio button
[11:36:53] <eddiemonge> hold on
[11:37:15] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: yeah, i was eventually going to add support for both radio and checkboxes
[11:37:18] <someprimetime> which is why i left that in there
[11:37:18] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: simply like this: http://jsfiddle.net/BeNG6/1/   -- works on 1.4
[11:38:04] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: at this point, why dont you just use jqueryui?
[11:38:14] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: just to learn
[11:38:55] <buddyq> hi guys, wondering how I can test if somoething is NOT empty?
[11:38:58] <buddyq> if(!"#error .divMessage:empty").show('slow');
[11:39:01] <buddyq> but that gives error.
[11:39:43] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: it doesnt work because thats not a valid easing
[11:39:55] <eddiemonge> the only valid easing options for jquery are swing and linear
[11:40:17] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: hmmm
[11:40:20] <buddyq> so if(!"#error .divMessage:empty").swing('slow');
[11:40:20] <Dan_Wilson_> if ("#error .divMessage").length > 0
[11:40:22] <someprimetime> if($('#div').length > 0)
[11:40:51] <someprimetime> buddyq: i'd use length before relying on a jquery function
[11:40:54] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: jqueryui adds additional easing methods
[11:40:59] <buddyq> ok
[11:41:04] <buddyq> lemme try that.
[11:41:39] <someprimetime> or you could do if(('#error .divMessage')[0]) { }
[11:41:41] <eddiemonge> Dan_Wilson_: that checks to see if there is a class with that name under that id
[11:41:48] <someprimetime> if !, rather
[11:41:53] <eddiemonge> buddyq: define empty
[11:41:55] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: you mean in repleacement of easeOutQuart?
[11:42:15] <Eviltwin> I'm seeing a surprising lack of $'s
[11:42:18] <buddyq> eddiemonge: empty in this case means, that div contains no content.
[11:42:21] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: i mean see ? animate

[11:43:10] <charlie12> any help will be greatly appreciated
[11:43:45] <phatboi> is there any easy way for me to move a dom object  from being inside one div to being inside of another
[11:44:01] <phatboi> or do i have to duplicate and then remove the old one
[11:45:13] <Ricardo_Martins> bot-t: it is what i'm doing, isnt it?
[11:45:14] <bot-t> Ricardo_Martins, Reply hazy, try again.
[11:48:32] <eddiemonge> buddyq: http://jsfiddle.net/mds52/1/
[11:48:48] <Ricardo_Martins> what i dont understand is why on the 1.4 works and on 1.7 doesnt, :O

[11:49:51] <phatboi> eddiemonge: ty
[11:51:46] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: lol
[11:51:55] <charlie12> Anyone used plupload before??
[11:52:23] <john-dev> charlie12 i do
[11:52:47] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: could you change my example to use animate to scroll up that bg 50px upper?
[11:53:45] <charlie12> Hi john-dev have you ever gotten this error "object doesn't support this property or method (line 2) (plupload.full.js)"
[11:53:47] <charlie12> I get this when using the flash runtime in ie
[11:53:48] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: i honestly doesnt know where is the error. If it doesnt work on other versions its ok
[11:54:06] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: $(ele).animate({top: -=50}, 300)
[11:54:08] <charlie12> john-dev
[11:54:11] <Eviltwin> charlie12: This sounds like a Plupload issue, not a jQuery issue
[11:54:22] <eddiemonge> Ricardo_Martins: are you including jQueryUI on the older versions?
[11:54:34] <charlie12> Eviltwin most likely but I think it might be a conflict with jQuery
[11:54:50] <Eviltwin> Then try removing jQuery and see what happens
[11:55:02] <Eviltwin> And consult their forum
[11:55:16] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: its a background...
[11:55:16] <charlie12> john-dev acs.fathomcreative.net is where this problem lies share >> your story >>
[11:55:24] <charlie12> Eviltwin ok
[11:56:08] <Eviltwin> charlie12: Try using their example in IE and see what happens: http://www.plupload.com/example_jquery_ui.php
[11:57:33] <depex> $('body').bind('resize', function() does not fire when ajax content are added. Anything to do about it?
[11:57:35] <charlie12> yup that works
[11:57:39] <john-dev> charlie12 did you try no conflict mode?
[11:57:42] <charlie12> Eviltwin with the flash runtime
[11:57:49] <Eviltwin> charlie12: Then see what you did differently and do it their way
[11:58:04] <nocturne7> does .change trigger on just an input that is not inside a form ?
[11:58:07] <charlie12> Eviltwin yea.... I have been trying that I will continue
[11:58:20] <john-dev> nocturne7 no
[11:58:26] <charlie12> the flash runtime works in FF but not IE it'w wierd
[11:58:28] <Eviltwin> We don't advertise support for jQuery plugins
[11:58:32] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: .animate({"background-position":"-1px -50px"}); works fine... but not at 1.7 =/  background-position may be not be supported on new version
[11:58:33] <charlie12> john-dev no haven't used no-conflict
[11:58:34] <Eviltwin> We'll try to help you if we're familiar with them
[11:58:41] <john-dev> charlie12 give it a try!
[11:58:41] <Eviltwin> But we don't make any promises
[11:58:47] <john-dev> helped me a lot of times..
[11:58:58] <charlie12> john-dev I don't see why I would need to as it they aren't sharing the namespace
[11:59:03] <charlie12> john-dev
[11:59:04] <charlie12> Ill try
[11:59:29] <john-dev> maybe you have someting else using jquery, for example a gallery or something..
[11:59:31] <eddiemonge> depex: i think thats for viewport resizing, not content resizing
[11:59:33] <nocturne7> john-dev: I am trying to call a function when a character is entered into this input box, how do I achieve this in JQuery then ?
[11:59:56] <cybersholt> here's something funny Q: whats the quickest way to hear back from a client?? send them an invoice! lol :P
[12:00:07] <john-dev> give the input an unique id and bind $('#the_id').live('change',function()...
[12:00:16] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[12:00:19] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[12:00:26] <john-dev> you can use val() to get it's content
[12:00:28] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on in 1.7+ instead
[12:00:50] <john-dev> .live is oldschool, true.. :)
[12:01:13] <depex> eddiemonge: tried with $(document) too. doesn't seem to fire at all. Once when the content loads
[12:01:14] <Eviltwin> No, it's uneducated hick school
[12:01:20] <shmup> of course when i want to show my classmates jsfiddle. it's down
[12:01:24] <Eviltwin> It's full retard
[12:01:24] <shmup> or i'm crazy
[12:01:37] <john-dev> Yea, looks like you know each other..
[12:01:42] <Eviltwin> ?down jsfiddle.net
[12:01:44] <eddiemonge> depex: again, its not for content changes
[12:01:58] <shmup> nvm
[12:01:58] <bot-t> Eviltwin, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[12:01:59] <depex> ah ok. anything I can do to detetct content changes?
[12:02:04] <nocturne7> Eviltwin: I have tried on I think, that did not work either
[12:02:06] <depex> trying to resize an iframe when the content changes
[12:02:12] <mika4> yep its down
[12:02:18] <eddiemonge> depex: thats not easy
[12:02:18] <shmup> it actually loaded on one of my 10 tries
[12:02:21] <shmup> i think i caught it on a burp
[12:02:38] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle's not down, it's flapping and running slow at points
[12:03:17] <shmup> lets call it down
[12:03:23] <shmup> more or less, it is
[12:04:02] <depex> eddiemonge. I'll see if I can simply bind it to the ajax event in some way
[12:04:13] <eddiemonge> depex: that would be better
[12:04:31] <eddiemonge> i find working with *frames* to be difficult and not fun
[12:04:37] <depex> indeed
[12:04:41] <depex> almost there tough
[12:05:21] <Ricardo_Martins> eddiemonge: thanks for everything... i'll keep searching
[12:05:28] <depex> the forum software appears to run an XenForo.activate function when adding content. can I simply listen for that, or would I need to modify the original js
[12:05:45] <eddiemonge> depends on that
[12:05:57] <SeanLazer> this has probably been asked a bunch of times but if i have a handler that's like $('a#thingy').live('click', function() { // stuff }); what's the preferred way to switch to .on()
[12:06:12] <SeanLazer> would it be $(document).on('click', 'a#thingy', function ...
[12:09:27] <eddiemonge> ?on @ SeanLazer
[12:09:28] <bot-t> SeanLazer, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:09:34] <kristofer91> What would i use to scan a div class on a php cms ?, i'm trying to make a loop that if a div is called wpsc-current-cat then display this.
[12:10:06] <eddiemonge> SeanLazer: and the 'a' part of "a#thingy" should not be there. it makes the selector 10x slower
[12:10:33] <SeanLazer> eddiemonge: only because i'm using an ID right?  sorry i was just firing out pseudo code without really thinking
[12:10:40] <eddiemonge> kristofer91: $('div.wpsc-current-cat').show()
[12:10:48] <eddiemonge> SeanLazer: right
[12:10:57] <SeanLazer> eddiemonge: is $('a.thingy') slower than $('.thingy') ?
[12:11:08] <redsquare> no
[12:11:29] <karl_> Anyone familiar with Knockout
[12:12:05] <kristofer91> eddiemonge: im a little tired.., it's not a div after all : <a class="wpsc_category_grid_item wpsc-current-cat "
[12:12:09] <mllie> How do I select a radio button so that the change() is executed?
[12:12:19] <jcrawford> hey guys I have a tr element that has a click handler.  In the last column of the tr element I have icons which are also clickable.  Now when I click the icon it triggers the tr.click so in the icon.click I have used e.stopPropagation(); and it stops the tr.click handler from firing.  However it appears I have to click my icon twice to get the fancybox element to appear on the screen.  thoughts as to why it would require 2 clicks for this now? ht
[12:12:55] <eddiemonge> SeanLazer: depends on the browser
[12:12:59] <redsquare> mllie makes no sense

[12:16:27] <padd173> long live jquery
[12:17:34] <redsquare> @karl_ not used it
[12:17:34] <kristofer91> How would i make jquery look for this class <a class="wpsc_category_grid_item wpsc-current-cat">
[12:17:55] <redsquare> there are two there kristofer91
[12:18:10] <redsquare> $('a.wpsc_category_grid_item.wpsc-current-cat')
[12:18:13] <redsquare> for both
[12:18:16] <kristofer91> i know the second one is dynamic
[12:18:19] <kristofer91> i just want the second one
[12:18:23] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/peNdh/1/
[12:18:40] <redsquare> $('a.wpsc-current-cat') kristofer91

[12:19:10] <kristofer91> i'm really really tired and starting to not make sense at all. the first one you sent redsquare should do it
[12:19:24] <kristofer91> as i only want it to do something when does two are wpsc_category_grid_item wpsc-current-cat
[12:19:32] <redsquare> that selects the anchor with both those classes
[12:19:40] <redsquare> you said only the second, so my second answer
[12:20:09] <kristofer91> will that one work even if it's like this  <a class="wpsc_category_grid_item wpsc-current-cat">
[12:20:45] <redsquare> try it:)
[12:21:00] <redsquare> easy in the console
[12:21:11] <kristofer91> yeah, i'm trying it :P
[12:26:50] <DrShoggoth> does jquery have a method to read what a css value is set to, not for an actual html element, but just what is set in the class
[12:27:31] <DrShoggoth> I want to change the height of an element that I am creating based on a height value stored in a css class,  ie,  the new object will have the height of the class subtracted from it
[12:28:07] <DrShoggoth> but since the class itself is on an html element that has yet to be drawn, i cannot use the css() or height() method because they will both return 0
[12:28:38] <DrShoggoth> is there a way to simply query what the 'height' value of a specific css class is?
[12:29:28] <pifantastic> ?css @ DrShoggoth
[12:29:29] <bot-t> DrShoggoth, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:29:43] <pifantastic> oh
[12:29:48] <pifantastic> sorry, didnt read backscroll
[12:29:55] <pifantastic> DrShoggoth: no, I dont think so
[12:30:24] <pifantastic> DrShoggoth: why don't you just add that class to the html element you are creating?
[12:31:13] <DrShoggoth> so there are two div's within a div,  the top div of the two will have a height set in css,  the bottom one will be the remainder of the size of the outer div
[12:31:24] <DrShoggoth> i'm probably doing it wrong
[12:32:09] <DrShoggoth> the thing is,  the height of the outer div is coming from backbone.js because it is saved per session
[12:32:17] <DrShoggoth> so that is an unknown too
[12:32:32] <DrShoggoth> well, i know it while i'm drawing it
[12:34:11] <kristofer91> the code seems to be working from what i can tell in firebug, but i can't get js to print it ou on the page
[12:34:17] <kristofer91> out
[12:37:47] <DrShoggoth> so no way to read an attribute value from a stylesheet?
[12:41:48] <Chopps> hi guys, so i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/mde2G/ how can i make my code add X number of fields with out clicking the add button??
[12:44:18] <john-dev> Chopps while using .trigger()
[12:44:43] <dabear> Chopps: to add multiple elements, use a loop. see ?mdc for loop
[12:44:48] <bot-t> Chopps, for - MDN - Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for
[12:45:25] <DrShoggoth> let me try and rephrase my question
[12:45:32] <someprimetime> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557445
[12:45:47] <Chopps> thanks john-dev and dabear :D thats what i wanted
[12:46:04] <DrShoggoth> is there any way to set the size of one undrawn element relative to the size of other undrawn element?
[12:46:12] <DrShoggoth> AN-other
[12:46:38] <john-dev> what do you mena by undrawn?
[12:46:53] <john-dev> mean*
[12:47:34] <DrShoggoth> http://pastebin.com/67tyuN7e
[12:47:56] <jexmex> $(this).delay(5000).removeClass('line-changed-new').addClass('line-changed-yellow'); That should work right?
[12:47:57] <DrShoggoth> ok so,  the very last line,  the  - 22
[12:48:20] <DrShoggoth> 20 is the height of .panelessDragbar
[12:48:50] <DrShoggoth> but if i try to use the value from css() it returns zero because it isn't drawn yet
[12:49:36] <someprimetime> thomasallen
[12:49:42] <someprimetime> woops wrong channel
[12:50:06] <DrShoggoth> so i'm looking for a way to get the css height value from the style sheet itself, because that wont be drawn for a bit
[12:50:29] <mika4> just trying to get the value of the dropdowns in this dialog when i click the SEND button  … any ideas   http://jsfiddle.net/peNdh/2/

[12:59:27] <cian1500ww> The link itself changes to an image after the click, the href is still attached but it doesn't apply the click function when clicked the second time

[13:09:51] <john-dev> var foo =  $('#input_box').attr('val',$('#whotobox').val());
[13:10:22] <john-dev> aith attr('','') you can set values, not determine..
[13:10:23] <mika4> What's input_box   where is that coming from ?  is that a jquery keyword?
[13:10:39] <john-dev> no.., you hsould have replaced this with the id..
[13:10:56] <dddbmt> Eviltwin, when I do that on an element with display: none; it returns nothing.
[13:11:01] <dddbmt> .css() ^
[13:11:06] <mika4> id of what?
[13:11:09] <mika4> i did
[13:11:26] <john-dev> the element you want to get infos from, in this case your dropdown right?
[13:11:27] <mika4> not an input box it's a mutiple select
[13:11:52] <mika4> this what I got   var foo =  $('#whotobox').attr('val',$('#whotobox').val());

[13:12:51] <john-dev> mika because its nonsense
[13:13:08] <mika4> oh i should be trying to get the value of a drop down in a dialog box?
[13:13:16] <mika4> shouldn't
[13:13:26] <john-dev> var foo =$('#whotobox').val()
[13:13:44] <mika4> actually i want the text  can I replace .val with .text
[13:13:45] <john-dev> but there is a :selected state you need to add, let me find it
[13:14:26] <john-dev> sure
[13:14:49] <john-dev> $('select.foo option:selected').val();    // get the value from a dropdown select
[13:14:49] <john-dev> $('select.foo option:selected').val();    // get the value from a dropdown select
[13:14:49] <john-dev> $('select.foo option:selected').val();    // get the value from a dropdown select
[13:14:49] <john-dev> $('select.foo option:selected').val();    // get the value from a dropdown select
[13:14:51] <john-dev> ups
[13:14:52] <john-dev> sry
[13:15:04] <john-dev> you should use option:selected to get the ctive item
[13:15:12] <john-dev> or either text.. :-)
[13:15:49] <dddbmt> villain_, it's part of a quite large code. but the flow is something like(for a popup dialog): $('<raw html, template>').hide().AppendToDOM().FitSize().show();
[13:16:09] <mika4> http://jsfiddle.net/peNdh/8/   now shows undefined  :-(    this jsut keeps getting worse
[13:16:28] <john-dev> undefined isn't that worse..
[13:16:32] <dddbmt> It's in FitSize() i am trying to get the padding. The element is also placed "absolute", and there's an PlaceElement() between FitSize() and show(). villain_
[13:17:11] <dddbmt> aaaand, I am cloning the <raw html, template>.
[13:17:31] <mika4> well john-dev  thanks for your help   imma walk away and try to come back to it later   good day

[13:45:18] <warrenparsons> Uriziel: $(elms).each( function(){ if ( !$(this).hasClass('myClass') ) { do something }
[13:45:43] <Guest66596> $().each is notoriously slow just fyi
[13:45:54] <Guest66596> or atleast $.each() is
[13:46:05] <nFFF> Yes your way is porbably best
[13:46:13] <warrenparsons> Guest66596: Yeah. .not() is a good call.
[13:46:32] <Guest66596> odds are eventually i'd have one good call :P
[13:46:41] <nFFF> :D
[13:46:51] <Uriziel> thanks
[13:46:59] <Shai_Tan> In jquery ui tabs, can I have tab redirect to anther url, rather than it trying to load the page in a tab? I wish to have a 'logout' tab
[13:47:03] <warrenparsons> Why write 6 characters when 60 will do?
[13:48:22] <nFFF> Them guys at hacker news really hate jquery http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557445
[13:50:03] <snover> hardly
[13:50:06] <tw2113> they'll live
[13:50:07] <academo> hi All
[13:50:35] <academo> Can I trigger an event ever before an ajax call and other on complete doesn't matter if I set it on oncomplete or before call it
[13:50:50] <academo> I need show a loading div but I don't want set oncomplete all time
[13:51:03] <Guest66596> lol everyone hates jquery nFFF
[13:51:15] <Guest66596> i hate jquery and i use it every day :P
[13:51:19] <nFFF> why though? is the performance that bad?
[13:52:21] <Guest66596> i had a app that used the $.each and it took like 11 seconds for it to process 30 thousand items, and when i switched to a for(in) it took like 3 seconds
[13:52:56] <snover> nFFF: jquery doesn’t provide you anything except the means to take some dom elements and do something with them (and do some ajax stuff)
[13:52:56] <snover> so
[13:53:03] <snover> architecturally you end up a mess
[13:53:09] <snover> it’s great for static sites
[13:53:28] <Guest66596> exactly it has it's place
[13:53:39] <Guest66596> for dom manipulation and easy ajax it's great
[13:53:59] <nFFF> I guess thats all I use it for
[13:54:05] <nFFF> simple DOM sutff and simple ajax
[13:54:38] <Guest66596> mhmmm, it's no mootools
[13:54:49] <warrenparsons> If you don't know how to optimize with a native loop with abnormally large enumerable objects, you probably should be learning JS instead of using jQuery blindly. Guest66596, that's not a slight on you, btw. Just general statement.
[13:55:06] <snover> I AM SO OFFENDED
[13:55:37] <warrenparsons> snover: That was my objective. :p
[13:55:45] <Guest66596> warrenparsons: without a doubt, i spent an entire day on jsperf finding the right way not the jquery way
[13:56:08] <tw2113> don't put a selector in a loop, that you know will be reused. Assign the dom element to a variable and reference the variable instead
[13:56:18] <tw2113> why make it go trudge the dom every iteration
[13:56:24] <MistuhKurtz> I have an accordion panel working, could anybody give me pointers on how to abstract it? http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/5gEew/2/
[13:56:29] <warrenparsons> jQuery is exactly the right tool for about 99% of what I use JS for. I'm not building big JS applications, tho.
[13:56:32] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Is there a way to group selectors in jQuery? For example: sel1=".a, .b"; sel2 = sel1 + ":first"; I want sel2 to select the first of everything that has a class of either a or b.
[13:56:48] <Guest66596> dont use class without a more defined selector yada yadda
[13:57:06] <_|Nix|_> Simply concatenated like that it'll give me all of .a and only the first of .b ...
[13:57:42] <_|Nix|_> A hack would be this: sel1=".a, .b"; sel2 = ":not(:not(" + sel1 + "))" + ":first";
[13:57:58] <_|Nix|_> But that needlessly inverts things.
[14:00:40] <Guest66596> could you do sel1 =  $(".a, .b"); sel2 = sel1.filter(":first");
[14:00:41] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/%3Aany
[14:00:43] <Guest66596> or something like that
[14:00:55] <Eviltwin> $(".a, .b").first()
[14:02:09] <_|Nix|_> I know how to do it using jQuery. The point is, I need to do it via a selector expression.
[14:03:45] <warrenparsons> _|Nix|_: Would sel2 = $('.a:first, .b:first'); not work for you?
[14:04:22] <Eviltwin> Not quite, I think that would yield two elements
[14:04:27] <Eviltwin> Unless that's what he's looking for
[14:04:35] <warrenparsons> Yeah, I'm not sure of that.
[14:05:19] <_|Nix|_> warrenparsons: Of course, but sel1 was just an example. What I mean is that sel1 can have any value, and those value which have the form "something, somethingelse" are the worst, because you cannot simply concatenate a string to them.
[14:05:45] <nFFF> you can using regex and replace
[14:05:49] <Eviltwin> Then use $(sel1).first()
[14:06:09] <jedimind> Resource interpreted as Other but transferred with MIME type undefined. <-- why would that keep showing up repeatedly during an animation?
[14:06:12] <jedimind> several hundred times
[14:06:37] <Eviltwin> Well most animations don't do that
[14:06:41] <Eviltwin> So I think you're doing something wrong
[14:06:44] <warrenparsons> _|Nix|_: So to make sure I understand: You want a grouped selector, and then later be able to grab the first match for each of those selectors?
[14:06:45] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: :any() is exactly what I need, but it's not implemented in jQuery yet, I don't think ...
[14:07:08] <jedimind> Eviltwin, its a really simple animate top
[14:07:10] <jedimind> there's nothing to it
[14:07:14] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ jedimind
[14:07:14] <bot-t> jedimind, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:07:44] <Eviltwin> _|Nix|_: You should avoid constructing messy selectors when using a selector then a method like .first() solves your problem
[14:07:48] <_|Nix|_> warrenparsons: I want to be able to take an existing selector, stored in a string, and further restrict it, making sure I restrict the entire selector. Eviltwin's link was exactly what I'm looking for, but I don't think it's implemented in jQuery yet.
[14:07:50] <jedimind> http://dev.bnotions.com/wordpress/rmwb/
[14:07:53] <jedimind> mouseover the BIG
[14:08:03] <jedimind> and you'll see the warning keeps adding up
[14:08:14] <jedimind> Eviltwin, i find that using .fist usually helps
[14:09:05] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/vAsQ9/ is the function
[14:09:18] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[14:09:23] <Eviltwin> I hoped you would have learned by now
[14:09:28] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle isn't meant to just be a pastebin
[14:09:36] <Eviltwin> It's meant to be a working demo
[14:09:50] <jedimind> im aware of that, i provided a lnk to the site
[14:09:51] <Eviltwin> I'm not getting any of these errors you speak of
[14:09:55] <jedimind> i just twanted to isolate the function for you
[14:09:58] <jedimind> its not an error, its a warning
[14:10:22] <jedimind> chrome16.0.912.77 m
[14:10:26] <nFFF> _|Nix|_, so you want for e.g. sel1 = '.foo, .bar' and sel2 = '.foo:first, .bar:first' ?
[14:10:36] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what's your opinon on: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557445 ?
[14:10:47] <Eviltwin> _|Nix|_: Your code should be designed to operate on collections, not selectors, when possible
[14:11:06] <FernandoLujan> anyone here have IE8 that's not on a VM?
[14:11:19] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: In jQuery 1.7+, there's no reason not to use .on
[14:11:34] <Eviltwin> But .bind, .live, and .delegate still exist (and all three use .on in 1.7+)
[14:11:37] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: right.. but i meant more so for the comments too
[14:11:40] <Eviltwin> However .live is deprecated
[14:11:43] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: In this case, I'm subclassing a jQuery mobile widget, and the options.initSelector for my widget is supposed to include that of my superclass, and the add an additional condition to it.
[14:11:51] <Eviltwin> And should no longer be used
[14:11:53] <someprimetime> all the bashing on jquery and it's so-called bloat
[14:11:58] <someprimetime> it's == its
[14:12:21] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: So, I don't want to know what the value of the superclass' options.initSelector is. I just want to take it, and tack on my additional criterion.
[14:12:45] <jedimind> criterion sounds like a transformer
[14:12:45] <Eviltwin> I'm not going to read through every comment here to see what I agree and disagree with
[14:12:48] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: Implemented this way, all the jQuery Mobile auto-enhance stuff will work for me in the standard way.
[14:12:52] <Eviltwin> People are entitles to their opinions
[14:13:11] <Eviltwin> entitled*
[14:15:02] <nFFF> _|Nix|_, maybe Im misunderstanding, but can't you use regex to manipulate sel1?
[14:15:26] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Can you write the regex for it?
[14:15:27] <warrenparsons> Eviltwin: someprimetime This comment pretty much sums up most of the complaints: "Most of your argument boils down to "jQuery makes it easy for shit developers to write shit code, therefore you shouldn't use it". No response necessary."
[14:15:58] <_|Nix|_> nFFF: I could, but I think it would be difficult. I mean, sel1 could be anything, like ":not(.a, #myId), .b" ...
[14:16:02] <Eviltwin> There's no programming language that prevents developers from writing shit code
[14:16:12] <warrenparsons> Eviltwin: Exactly.
[14:16:33] <_|Nix|_> nFFF: Good luck figuring out that you're not supposed to change .a to .a:first ...
[14:16:34] <nFFF> _|Nix|_ for this define the problem
[14:16:39] <warrenparsons> There was plenty of shitty JS written before jQuery came along. More now...
[14:16:48] <nFFF> and goto #regex :DD
[14:16:58] <warrenparsons> Hell, I even wrote some of it. :D
[14:17:11] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what are good books to read for overall best practices in js/jquery?
[14:17:24] <Eviltwin> nFFF: I can promise you that Sizzle selectors are not a regular language
[14:17:35] <Eviltwin> And thus regexes alone will not save you
[14:17:48] <_|Nix|_> nFFF: OK: sel1 is a black box and the only thing I know about it is that it's a perfectly valid jquery selector. My task is to construct sel2 using sel1.
[14:18:34] <nFFF> Hey Im just an ideas guy
[14:18:56] <nFFF> You could do split sel one into single selectors quite easily
[14:19:11] <Eviltwin> Okay, write code for it
[14:19:24] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: Yeah, I'm curious too ...
[14:19:56] <nFFF> Using regex, basically a ',' surrounded by an [a-z][A-Z] is what Im thinking
[14:20:04] <Eviltwin> Write code for it
[14:20:08] <Eviltwin> Not vague statements
[14:20:29] <_|Nix|_> nFFF: Try that on ":not(.a, #myId), .b"
[14:20:30] <nFFF> Ok
[14:21:00] <_|Nix|_> nFFF: It'll split it into three parts, but that's wrong, because it only has two: :not(.a, #myId) and .b ...
[14:21:07] <nFFF> Yea
[14:21:10] <webPragmatist1> uhm
[14:21:24] <nFFF> I'm just thinking if theres a clear case, where perhas you could have !() in there
[14:21:34] <webPragmatist1> can someone recommend a modal plugin that doesn't duplicate the stupid content in the modal
[14:21:49] <webPragmatist1> http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/ <<< sucks
[14:23:10] <mordof> will unbind('click') also unset live('click' handlers?
[14:23:20] <Eviltwin> No, I don't believe it does
[14:23:30] <Eviltwin> But you shouldn't be using .live, you should be using .delegate or .on
[14:23:52] <mordof> why?
[14:24:02] <nFFF> _|Nix|_ give me 5 minutes, it won't be nice
[14:24:08] <nFFF> but I think I can do it
[14:24:08] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[14:24:27] <mordof> Eviltwin: that's a good reason :) i'll switch
[14:26:44] <someprimetime> is jquery eventually going to have an option to select which modules to use and download those on the new site like mootools does?
[14:27:01] <Eviltwin> I believe it's under consideration
[14:27:51] <someprimetime> cool, make it happen Eviltwin
[14:27:52] <someprimetime> thanks
[14:27:54] <someprimetime> ;)
[14:29:50] <mordof> trying to keep my use of event handlers clean since i've switched over page transitions to ajax
[14:29:58] <mordof> unsetting everything before reloading
[14:30:43] <tfittsy> does anyone here use highcharts?
[14:31:00] <poweratom> yup… we use highcharts extensively at work
[14:31:10] <gkatsev> highcharts ftw
[14:31:34] <mordof> highcharts?
[14:32:02] <gkatsev> mordof: possibly best/prettiest svg charting lib
[14:32:04] <Guest66596> $(all[m], target).length is returning one. however all[m], which is a jquery obj just like target, exists just not inside of target. i need it to return zero
[14:32:19] <mordof> oooh
[14:32:20] <Guest66596> any clue what i'm doing wrong
[14:32:20] <tfittsy> poweratom: I'm trying to make it so when I click on a bar in a barchart it will pull a new chart.  I'm trying to pass the params for the new chart to be loaded in with the series data.  It works just find for pie charts but the data just doesn't pass on a bar chart.  Have you ever done anything like that?
[14:32:35] <tfittsy> just fine*
[14:33:03] <mordof> gkatsev: whoa.... just seeing the homepage and i'm all "i want to use this!!"
[14:33:10] <mordof> i have a use for this too!! OH MAN.. i'm so excited, hahah
[14:34:17] <poweratom> are you trying to pass custom data that you've collected from elsewhere outside of the chart or chart data (like a series or something)?
[14:34:50] <nF{{> _|Nix|_
[14:34:53] <nF{{> http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/
[14:35:04] <nF{{> or Eviltwin
[14:35:04] <gkatsev> mordof: haha
[14:35:09] <nF{{> Its more pseudo code
[14:35:11] <tfittsy> poweratom: yeah, it's generated in php from a database
[14:35:11] <gkatsev> mordof: it is pretty awesome
[14:35:16] <nF{{> it may need slight work
[14:35:21] <nF{{> but I think it does what you want
[14:35:22] <mordof> gkatsev: seems like it.. going through the demos and .. wow
[14:35:28] <mordof> gkatsev: i'm quite thoroughly impressed
[14:35:53] <gkatsev> yeah, I use it to display data for users logged in on linux/windows machines in the lab in my college.
[14:36:07] <poweratom> tfittsy: How are are you passing the data now?
[14:36:08] <Eviltwin> nF{{: That regex doesn't parse
[14:36:14] <nF{{> IT does
[14:36:18] <nF{{> The regex works
[14:36:22] <nF{{> the rest needs work
[14:36:23] <Eviltwin> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
[14:37:09] <nF{{> I tested the regex
[14:37:13] <nF{{> the for loop need swork
[14:37:19] <nF{{> you can see what Im trying to do
[14:37:56] <tfittsy> just as a series object like { name: 'StoreName', data: [2677.05], param: 'pointID=23&reportType=salesByStoreDepartment', tip: '$2677.05', sliced: false, selected: false }
[14:38:13] <nF{{> jsfiddle is going slow for me
[14:38:22] <tfittsy> in a bar chart, it only receives name and data, in a pie chart it passes everything
[14:38:24] <Eviltwin> Your code yields "undefinednot(.a):firstnot(.a):first"
[14:38:26] <Eviltwin> As sel3
[14:38:50] <Eviltwin> You have failed
[14:38:53] <nF{{> No
[14:38:54] <nF{{> Sec
[14:38:59] <nF{{> Let me get jsfiddle working
[14:39:20] <poweratom> tfittsy: So I assume you are passing it from within "plotOptions => events => click"?
[14:39:47] <_|Nix|_> nF{{: Maybe you broke jsfiddle ;)
[14:40:43] <tfittsy> poweratom: yeah, that's where I'm putting the code to pull the links
[14:40:54] <tfittsy> or the new charts
[14:41:58] <tfittsy> but I try dumping the point object to the console and that other data I pass just isn't there.
[14:43:05] <poweratom> tfittsy: this may not be the answer you want to hear, but I'd recommend passing everything as a GET param like so: "pointID=23&reportType=salesByStoreDepartmen&name=myName&data=myData&tip=$1234"… pass that to another PHP script, and have the PHP script process that to return the proper data for the 2nd chart
[14:43:35] <poweratom> it's much safer and robust this way because GET can only handle a fixed amount of characters before it stops accepting any more chars
[14:44:10] <Compeeler> hey guys, can someone help me to find whats wrong? I am using jquery to check a checkbox and im not sure whats up, http://pastebin.com/RVjNr4x6
[14:44:17] <tfittsy> poweratom: but when I click on the bar, where do I get that get param from?
[14:44:22] <poweratom> if u have a huge dataset, you might even want to consider bind the click even to do a POST request
[14:44:39] <poweratom> you'd construct it on the fly
[14:45:33] <poweratom> my "guess" is that it's not passing because the URL may not like a certain character you are passing and the rest of the URL just gets truncated or something
[14:45:40] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: whats wrong with it? see ? paste
[14:46:15] <tfittsy> right, but what I'm saying is I don't know where I can get data=myData for that point on the chart
[14:46:17] <Compeeler> Its not unchecking the checkbox, im not sure why. http://pastebin.com/RVjNr4x6
[14:46:25] <poweratom> OH
[14:46:30] <tfittsy> it won't pass it in for a bar chart
[14:46:32] <Compeeler> $('.checkbox0 input').prop('checked', false);    is this correct
[14:46:34] <tfittsy> and it passes it no trouble for a pie chart
[14:47:05] <poweratom> tfittsy: this.series.name
[14:47:09] <poweratom> this.series.data
[14:48:14] <Compeeler> does anyone have an idea
[14:48:52] <nF{{> _|Nix|_ Eviltwin
[14:48:53] <nF{{> var sel2 = sel1.match(/\s*(\w+\([^)]*\)|\.[^,])/g);
[14:49:11] <nF{{> http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/5/
[14:49:14] <nF{{> the regex works
[14:49:22] <nF{{> fix the for loop and it's done
[14:49:54] <eddiemonge> Compeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/utbL6/ looks fine to me
[14:50:05] <tfittsy> ok, so if I send in this for the data { name: 'StoreName', data: [2677.05], param: 'pointID=23&reportType=salesByStoreDepartment', tip: '$2677.05', sliced: false, selected: false }
[14:50:15] <tfittsy> I would get StoreName by this.series.name
[14:50:23] <tfittsy> and the param info by this.series.param
[14:50:47] <someprimetime> does anyone know why this generates an additional get request? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pn8zC/
[14:50:47] <tfittsy> right?
[14:50:55] <mordof>  ouch
[14:50:56] <poweratom> tfittsy : yup! you got it
[14:51:07] <mordof> gkatsev: highcharts is kinda pricey >.<
[14:51:27] <someprimetime> basically it just grabs a container from a url and appends it to the current container when you scroll down to the bottom of the screen
[14:51:28] <Compeeler> hmm
[14:51:33] <someprimetime> for some reason, it's generating 2 responses though
[14:51:48] <mordof> gkatsev: though i suppose for the quality..
[14:51:57] <poweratom> tfittsy: But like I said, once u have a big enough dataset, you should consider having the click event call a 2nd php script to generate another json dataset for your 2nd chart just so that you don't have to pass that awkward URL via GET which has char limitations
[14:52:17] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: what browser?
[14:52:28] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: chrome
[14:52:30] <poweratom> and you only pass enough data to the PHP to generate 2nd data set you need for the 2nd chart
[14:53:17] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: i only see one request http://jsfiddle.net/pn8zC/1/
[14:53:19] <someprimetime> does it firefox too though
[14:53:59] <nF{{> Eviltwin _|Nix|_ at least fix the array and see if it works :|
[14:54:06] <Compeeler> why doesnt this http://jsfiddle.net/utbL6/1/   work though
[14:54:46] <eddiemonge> because False isnt anything
[14:54:55] <eddiemonge> ?eval False
[14:54:58] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: man that is so weird
[14:54:59] <bot-t> eddiemonge: ReferenceError: False is not defined
[14:55:05] <someprimetime> it's actually appending the div 3 times
[14:55:14] <Compeeler> huh,
[14:55:18] <Compeeler> isnt it a boolean
[14:55:23] <poweratom> Compeeler: $('.checkbox0 input').prop('checked', false);
[14:55:30] <poweratom> lowercase "false"
[14:55:36] <poweratom> False != false
[14:55:44] <Eviltwin> nF{{: Dude, it doesn't work
[14:55:45] <Compeeler> nice,

[14:58:13] <oojacoboo> hey guys, how can I fire an event that I preventDefault() after some evaluation
[14:58:18] <oojacoboo> event.what()
[14:58:20] <nF{{> Eviltwin it can be done with regex
[14:58:41] <nF{{> and it does work?
[14:58:44] <nF{{> for me
[14:58:49] <poweratom> tfittsy: param is a query method, no? did you pass query into the chart object?
[14:58:55] <eddiemonge> tfittsy: why noy do console.log( this, this.series)?
[14:58:58] <poweratom> .param()
[14:59:11] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: huh?
[14:59:27] <danzik17> nF{{: what are you trying to do anyway?
[14:59:58] <oojacoboo> function() { event.preventDefault(); if(confirm("do you like me?") event.what(); });
[15:00:03] <nF{{> prove to Eviltwin that you cna split goruped selectors using regex
[15:00:16] <nF{{> and add :first to each selector
[15:00:29] <Eviltwin> nF{{: Okay, two things A) No, it can't be done with just regexes. Regexes represent regular languages and selectors are not a regular language B) Your code absolutely does not work, not even close
[15:01:02] <danzik17> Eviltwin: i think it can,  just not using his regex.  should i post a working one? =P
[15:01:40] <Eviltwin> danzik17: His goal is to take something of the form "a, b, c, ..." and turn it into "a:first, b:first, c:first, ..."
[15:01:41] <gkatsev> mordof: yeah, it is, but for my uses it is free :/
[15:01:46] <Eviltwin> Where a, b, and c can be complex selectors
[15:01:58] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: what is event.what()?
[15:02:06] <oojacoboo> a question
[15:02:06] <nF{{> How can you say the code isn't close to working? the only problem is it returns an 'undefined as well
[15:02:06] <Eviltwin> i.e. including things like :not(.xyz, #foo)
[15:02:09] <oojacoboo> to restore the default event
[15:02:10] <oojacoboo> and fire it
[15:02:17] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: I was thinking to just split along ",", then concatenate all adjacent entries where the sum of brackets is non-zero.
[15:02:17] <Eviltwin> It's doable but it's not a regular language, it's context-free
[15:02:33] <Eviltwin> _|Nix|_: Yeah, that's pretty much what you have to do
[15:02:49] <danzik17> like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/9/
[15:02:49] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: Ick ... counting brackets ...
[15:02:50] <Eviltwin> _|Nix|_: The problem for you is that it's still fundamentally different from $("a, b, c").first()
[15:02:52] <nF{{> The regex works?? it retunrs: undefined, selector1:first, selector2:first
[15:02:59] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: put the preventDefault in the else statement
[15:03:00] <Eviltwin> $("a:first, b:first, c:first")
[15:03:10] <Eviltwin> nF{{: The goal is to make the selector
[15:03:14] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: nope, that's not hte goal
[15:03:18] <Eviltwin> And you are failing in that goal
[15:03:19] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: I don't want $("a, b, c").first() ...
[15:03:31] <oojacoboo> maybe an else statement, but wouldn't it fire the event on click regardless?
[15:03:31] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: well thats how you would do it
[15:03:46] <Eviltwin> _|Nix|_: Can you give a real example of what you're trying to do?
[15:04:15] <mordof> gkatsev: that actually leads me to want to get a license for my purposes even more despite it's price. I can really appreciate the fact that they're distributing it for free under those terms.
[15:04:19] <nF{{> danzik17 seems to work
[15:04:29] <Eviltwin> Because $(":not(:not(a, b, c)):first") produces the same result as $("a, b, c").first()
[15:04:40] <Eviltwin> And that result is different from $("a:first, b:first, c:first")
[15:04:53] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: Sure: ":jqmData(role='popupwindow')" + ":jqmData(show-arrow='true')"
[15:05:07] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: In this case, simple concatenation will work.
[15:05:20] <nF{{> Eviltwin look at danzik17s' code?
[15:05:34] <_|Nix|_> Eviltwin: However, if later I decide to modify the selector for popupwindow to include a comma-separated list, it will break the subclass.
[15:06:25] <nF{{> mine fucking works
[15:06:34] <Eviltwin> nF{{: No, yours fucking doesn't
[15:06:44] <Eviltwin> This is using Sizzle's chunker
[15:06:48] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: i dont think you understand how preventDefault works. it prevents the default action from occurring if its somewhere reachable in the code. otherwise the default action fires
[15:06:51] <nF{{> http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/10/
[15:07:00] <nF{{> Whats wrong about it?
[15:07:04] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I got it, I put the preventDefault() in an else
[15:07:10] <nF{{> am I missing something?
[15:07:12] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pn8zC/1 is there any way to limit the ajax request to just one?
[15:07:16] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pn8zC/2/
[15:07:27] <Eviltwin> nF{{: http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/11/
[15:07:31] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I understand how it works, I was attempting to disable, then fire after something else
[15:07:33] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: thats what i said!
[15:07:44] <Eviltwin> nF{{: Does that look right to you?
[15:07:46] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: you dont need to disable then re-enable
[15:07:54] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I get that now ;)
[15:07:54] <eddiemonge> you only need to disable
[15:08:03] <oojacoboo> right, I didn't know the confirm would fire first
[15:08:29] <nF{{> Ok but you could add more complex regex
[15:09:17] <_|Nix|_> nF{{: The point is that the language of selectors is more complex than any regex can describe.
[15:09:55] <danzik17> Eviltwin: just curious, was stealing the chunker not allowed as part of the challenge?  =P
[15:10:21] <Eviltwin> danzik17: No, the point was to either accomplish the goal or demonstrate to nF{{ that he wasn't thinking this through enough
[15:10:24] <Eviltwin> And I think we did both of those
[15:11:03] <eddiemonge> i dont know. i still have some doubts
[15:11:06] <nF{{> Ok perhaps it can't be done, my gut says it can
[15:11:16] <nF{{> but it's probably over my head
[15:11:22] <Eviltwin> nF{{: You're falling into the classic trap of regexes
[15:11:31] <Eviltwin> People think that a regex alone can solve any subtitution
[15:11:48] <Eviltwin> And unfortunately regexes are 1:1 with regular languages and selectors aren't regular languages
[15:11:59] <nF{{> How complete does he need it to be, surely there are some boundries to what he might use in regards to selectors
[15:12:05] <Jonno_FTW> I am using the jquery ui datepicker here, http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ and the keyboard shortcuts that use ctrl do not work in firefox,
[15:12:18] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Small issue: http://jsfiddle.net/sGzch/13/
[15:12:29] <nF{{> It doesn't need to follow refular languages, it just needs a pattern
[15:12:33] <nF{{> that can be defined
[15:12:43] <Eviltwin> nF{{: The thing that goes in between the //'s is called a regular expression
[15:12:58] <Eviltwin> And a regular expression represents a subset of the set of all regular languages
[15:13:08] <Eviltwin> And selectors aren't a regular language
[15:13:29] <Eviltwin> So regexes alone cannot solve this problem
[15:13:35] <danzik17> Eviltwin: fair enough - didn't really spend much time on it.  i'm sure it can be done with the chunker though since you know...Sizzle works =P
[15:14:23] <Eviltwin> danzik17: I think the chunker was mostly designed to get a sense of the complexity of the selector and determine what strategy to take from there
[15:14:29] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong about that
[15:14:39] <nF{{> Fuck it I tired anyway :PP
[15:14:41] <nF{{> tried*
[15:14:51] <nF{{> I admit defeat
[15:15:27] <eddiemonge> Jonno_FTW: windows?
[15:15:28] <nF{{> Perhaps if _|Nix|_ knows the level of complexity the selectors will be, he could use some regex
[15:15:32] <danzik17> Eviltwin: i think there's more to it than that, but i'd be lying if i said i actually understood the whole Sizzle source right now
[15:16:15] <Eviltwin> I think you need to look at backref 2
[15:16:45] <Eviltwin> It indicates the separator for "div a" vs "div, a"
[15:30:48] <webPragmatist1> if this is a form $(this).find("button[type='submit']") (does that make sense?)
[15:31:11] <Shai_Tan> IN the ui tabs, is it possible to have a tab redirect to anther page, rather than loading the page?
[15:31:21] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist1: Sure
[15:31:32] <webPragmatist1> odd
[15:35:15] <webPragmatist1> given  $.ajax … success: function(data) { … does "data" have the form? I think I'm not able to do $(this) inside of the callback
[15:35:47] <webPragmatist1> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/81fiomjr7m9te2id5eymgw
[15:35:49] <webPragmatist1> that's the full code
[15:36:06] <mythril> are there any good resources out there for writing a plugin that handles a given css property?
[15:36:55] <chovy> mythril: what do you mean?
[15:37:02] <chovy> "handles a given css property"
[15:37:26] <chovy> webPragmatist1: save this as that before the callback.
[15:37:36] <chovy> webPragmatist1: then you can use that in the callback.
[15:38:14] <mythril> chovy, I want to write a plugin that can animate css clip
[15:38:33] <chovy> mythril: well plugins aren't that difficult.
[15:38:43] <chovy> $("#foo").doAnimation(); ??
[15:39:53] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist1: see ?$.proxy
[15:39:55] <bot-t> webPragmatist1, jQuery.proxy() - Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular scope. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[15:40:04] <Eviltwin> The problem is explained there
[15:40:12] <webPragmatist1> chovy: pass it in the callback?
[15:40:19] <mythril> I mean more like $('#foo').css({clip: 'rect(4px 10px 20px 14px)'}).animate({clip: 'rect(0px 0px 100px 100px)'}, 500, 'linear');
[15:42:47] <chovy> webPragmatist1: hang on
[15:43:52] <chovy> webPragmatist1: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/H4b9z/
[15:45:36] <chovy> mythril: assuming that lines works, you could write a plugin that does something like $("#foo").doAnimation();
[15:46:48] <webPragmatist1> chovy: does something like http://pastie.textmate.org/private/kah1hhh84nppfaufwwf7a
[15:46:49] <webPragmatist1> work?
[15:46:50] <mythril> chovy, it doesn't, that's what I'm looking to implement
[15:47:01] <webPragmatist1> meaning that doesn't work for me for some reason
[15:47:09] <chovy> mythril: i see. I don't know much about the clip property.
[15:47:21] <mythril> chovy, the first bit works(css), but the second doesn't (animate)
[15:47:34] <chovy> webPragmatist1: that should work.
[15:47:59] <webPragmatist1> it never removes the disable
[15:48:04] <webPragmatist1> oh wait
[15:48:07] <chovy> mythril: clip probably isn't an animatable property.
[15:48:09] <mythril> chovy, it's very rarely used, but I need it
[15:48:20] <webPragmatist1> lemmie try .removeAttr('disabled');
[15:48:29] <mythril> chovy, I know, I was asking how I would start to implement it
[15:48:36] <chovy> webPragmatist1: or .attr('disabled', false)
[15:48:52] <mythril> chovy, I think it has to do with jQuery.cssHooks

[15:52:29] <elitecoder> I need to find out what members are in 'ui.item' in this : http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select
[15:52:44] <elitecoder> a generic way to iterate the members of an object would also be useful
[15:52:52] <elitecoder> either one would help me figure out wtf is in this thing :]
[15:59:36] <Emn1ty> Anyone willing to help me shrink this code block down? still pretty new to javascript and am getting very tired of large if statements. This is also for global field validation on a website so the smaller it is the better. http://pastebin.com/4X3cuKJm

[16:01:29] <z0ned> i've created a google.maps.Marker object on my map, it has a listener for a click event. how would i go about manually firing off that markers click event? (i have it in a markers[], and i know the index of the marker i want to trigger) how do i select the marker? markers[10].click(); wouldn't exactly work
[16:01:55] <webguynow> any spine.js or backbone gurus in here ?  maybe pm, or take it to specific topic channel

[16:22:58] <jimubao> hi there i'm build an web app with jquery mobile
[16:23:20] <jimubao> i'm having issue with scrollview, to make it scroll to the bottom
[16:23:22] <eddiemonge> .... #jquerymobile ....
[16:29:56] <arcticseal> I see different places suggesting that I end all my custom functions with return false; and some that do not.  Should I make my functions return a value even if the outcome is not dependent on a return value?
[16:30:48] <eddiemonge> no, dont return false unless you need the function to return a boolean value of false
[16:31:09] <eddiemonge> if its a jquery plugin/function, return the jquery object
[16:31:20] <eddiemonge> otherwise, return only what you need
[16:35:41] <arcticseal> Sorry for the repeat, internet crapped out on me....  I see different places suggesting that I end all my custom functions with return false; and some that do not.  Should I make my functions return a value even if the outcome is not dependent on a return value?
[16:35:50] <eddiemonge> no, dont return false unless you need the function to return a boolean value of false
[16:35:52] <eddiemonge> if its a jquery plugin/function, return the jquery object

[16:49:00] <Eviltwin> responseText*
[16:49:35] <LordThumper> Hi there. jQuery website recommends not using .live anymore, and using .on instead.
[16:49:50] <BinaryKitten> correct
[16:49:50] <LordThumper> However .on doesn't seem to be attached to elements that are created dynamically
[16:49:56] <LordThumper> Am i using it wrong?
[16:50:08] <BinaryKitten> LordThumper depends, how are you using .on
[16:50:13] <BinaryKitten> and how were you using .live?
[16:50:19] <LordThumper> $("#TableDiv").live('click', function () { }) works
[16:50:27] <LordThumper> $("#TableDiv").on('click', function () { }) does not
[16:50:46] <BinaryKitten> ah i see
[16:51:00] <BinaryKitten> .on is a multi purpose singel unified event binding
[16:51:09] <BinaryKitten> you're using it in bind mode
[16:51:13] <LordThumper> Ah I see
[16:51:16] <BinaryKitten> let me just check something
[16:51:26] <LordThumper> Sure, thanks
[16:52:21] <BinaryKitten> ok 1st off.. why #TableDiv
[16:52:23] <BinaryKitten> ?
[16:52:45] <anli_> If I put text next to a div that is an inline-block, they should go on the same line, right?
[16:53:23] <BinaryKitten> LordThumper?
[16:53:50] <LordThumper> Oh dunno
[16:53:59] <LordThumper> I can attach to something inside the div?
[16:54:17] <BinaryKitten> probably best to not use an Id for live updated
[16:54:26] <LordThumper> I am constantly changing that div
[16:54:36] <BinaryKitten> is the #TableDiv the item that's not going to change?
[16:54:50] <LordThumper> It is getting .replace()
[16:54:51] <BinaryKitten> i mean, sure it's contents will
[16:54:58] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[16:55:01] <acidjazz> ur mosm a div
[16:55:01] <LordThumper> itself, not its contents
[16:55:04] <acidjazz> moms*
[16:55:09] <wookiehangover> ?mlym
[16:55:10] <bot-t> much like your mother
[16:55:17] <BinaryKitten> ok does it have a stable parent?
[16:55:18] <acidjazz> lol
[16:55:26] <acidjazz> i liek that mlym
[16:55:28] <LordThumper> Yes it does, or I can make one,
[16:55:37] <LordThumper> I can go around this several ways
[16:55:40] <LordThumper> Or just use .live
[16:55:55] <LordThumper> I was just curious why .on is not being applied to future elements
[16:55:58] <BinaryKitten> ok $('stableparentSelector').on('click', '#TableDiv', function() {});
[16:56:05] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge++
[16:56:12] <Emn1ty> darn
[16:56:22] <eddiemonge> huh?
[16:56:23] <LordThumper> Don't events bubble up?
[16:56:33] <BinaryKitten> .on(
[16:56:35] <Emn1ty> tried to give you a prop:P
[16:56:38] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: yes
[16:56:46] <BinaryKitten> .on(event, fn) = .bind(event, fn)
[16:57:11] <BinaryKitten> .on(event, selector, fn) = .delegate...
[16:57:36] <BinaryKitten> $(document.body).on(event, selector,fn) = .live
[16:57:45] <eddiemonge> .on(event, selector, fn) = .delegate(selector, event, fn)
[16:57:58] <BinaryKitten> thanks eddiemonge
[16:58:25] <LordThumper> Ah I understand now, thanks alot :)
[16:58:29] <BinaryKitten> no worries
[16:58:36] <anli_> Is the opacity of a <p> affecting imgs inside?
[16:58:39] <BinaryKitten> LordThumper if you can AVOID .live
[16:58:48] <BinaryKitten> and it's .on equiv
[16:58:49] <anli_> Maybe div is more appropriate than p here
[16:58:52] <LordThumper> Will do :) replaced with .on
[16:59:09] <BinaryKitten> yep but don't go with the $(document.body).on ....
[16:59:18] <BinaryKitten> it's overkill
[16:59:45] <BinaryKitten> go only as far up the dom tree as required to find a stable item
[16:59:56] <BinaryKitten> and use that as your .on starting point in .delegate mode
[17:00:00] <LordThumper> Yeah :) Added to the parent
[17:00:03] <BinaryKitten> :)
[17:00:08] <BinaryKitten> awesome
[17:00:18] <LordThumper> Working great :) thanks again
[17:00:42] <red_square> BinaryKitten did you manage to purchase any android products with your maestro:)
[17:01:03] <BinaryKitten> nope
[17:01:07] <BinaryKitten> you know i didnt lol
[17:01:20] <red_square> haha yeah
[17:01:34] * BinaryKitten is investigating pre-paid visa
[17:01:43] <BinaryKitten> which i'll top up with my maestro
[17:02:00] <red_square> or change banks and get a visa debit
[17:02:07] <BinaryKitten> bah
[17:02:10] <red_square> who still issues maestro
[17:02:17] <BinaryKitten> they'll only give me a visa electron if i switch
[17:02:27] <BinaryKitten> which is no good for most places online
[17:02:30] <red_square> ughh
[17:02:34] <BinaryKitten> yeah I know
[17:02:52] <BinaryKitten> so, will stick with the one i can buy rail tickets with

[17:36:52] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: http://jsbin.com/eyitus/2/edit - any reason it wouldn't be appending the <span>?
[17:39:13] <Emn1ty> ah, he logged...
[17:39:52] <Emn1ty> hmm... anyone else? http://jsbin.com/eyitus/2/edit - know why the span isn't getting added in the the if that is testing for the class 'required'?
[17:44:31] <Eviltwin> jsbin rarely lets me actually see the source
[17:44:38] <Eviltwin> Can you throw this in a jsFiddle or pastebin instead?
[17:45:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, he's gone
[17:50:20] <duncanbeevers> What preconditions need to be met in order for jQuery to recognize a response as JSON and pass that object as the first argument to a success or failure callback?
[18:01:37] <chovy> duncanbeevers: the response header should be application/json
[18:01:44] <chovy> although it does work if it isn't
[18:02:51] <duncanbeevers> I'm just trying to work out when the first params passed will be the jqXHR object, and when it will be the parsed portion of the payload.
[18:08:38] <tdkedd> hi, can anyone tell me if its possible and how to manipulate a section of html before its appended to the whole document?
[18:10:22] <duncanbeevers> tdkedd: Sure, just perform whatever transformations you want on it, like so: $("<div/>").addClass("hotdogs").appendTo(document.body)
[18:11:32] <abjorn> coldhead: pain in the ass getting used to using a fucking mac
[18:11:42] <abjorn> it's the little things, ya know
[18:11:58] <abjorn> like having to bring a window into focus because being able to click anything inside of it
[18:12:15] <snover> that wasn’t even a grammatically correct sentence, how could it be a valid operation?!
[18:13:04] <abjorn> *before being
[18:13:09] <abjorn> IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY
[18:13:18] <abjorn> a long day of getting no work done
[18:13:28] <snover> a long day of fucking macs
[18:13:31] <abjorn> ^
[18:13:48] <abjorn> a long day of setting up and getting used to my new mac for work and figuring out firework's bullshit
[18:13:56] <snover> wooo fireworks
[18:13:58] <abjorn> fucking fireworks
[18:14:07] <snover> the best graphics software with the worst fucking ui ever
[18:14:11] <abjorn> ^
[18:14:20] <tdkedd> duncanbeevers: well, i would like to find the second child element and set its value to something, but when i do console.log($tempHtml.find($(#'.taskid'))); i get an empty array
[18:14:20] <snover> ABJORN LIKES DICKS
[18:14:25] <abjorn> I DO NOT
[18:14:28] <snover> darn it
[18:14:36] <abjorn> I don't just ^ everything
[18:14:41] <snover> WELL I TRIED
[18:14:45] <abjorn> YOU TRIED WRONG
[18:15:46] <abjorn> I also think that it's really retarded that fireworks decides that when you change focus to another window that it's going to hide half it's fucking UI. I mean, I get WHY, but it just completely messed me up every time.
[18:15:59] <duncanbeevers> tdkedd: If the element has not yet been added to the DOM I don't think you can use DOM-traversal methods on it. You'll have to walk the partially-constructed sub-tree using the native traversal methods.
[18:16:01] <abjorn> minor gripes, but whatever
[18:16:06] <abjorn> at least I have my shell
[18:16:13] <abjorn> more than I can say about Windows
[18:17:14] <abjorn> jQuery isn't partial to whether a node tree is in the main document, or if it's a fragment, last I checked.
[18:17:23] <abjorn> If it has access to DOM methods, it can use it.
[18:17:28] <chee> ABJORN LIKES DICKS
[18:17:32] <abjorn> NOPE
[18:17:32] <snover> ^
[18:17:33] <tdkedd> duncanbeevers: and where can i find these native traversal methods (are these the traversal methods from javascript) ?
[18:17:35] <abjorn> LOL
[18:17:36] <chee> damn
[18:17:49] <chee> lolo
[18:17:57] <abjorn> tdkedd: He's referring to the standard DOM API, but you should be able to use jQuery either way.
[18:18:04] <chee> abjorn: i have also recently migrated to a macintosh and liking dicks
[18:18:09] <abjorn> lol
[18:18:18] <abjorn> Well, fuck the police, I'm still using Windows at home
[18:18:24] <chee> ftp
[18:18:41] <abjorn> That's exactly what FTP stands for.
[18:18:54] <abjorn> Everyone thinks it's File Transfer Protocol, but nope.
[18:18:54] <elitecoder> How do I override a jquery library function?
[18:18:55] <chee> yes, in all contexts
[18:18:56] <abjorn> Fuck The Police.
[18:19:09] <elitecoder> I need to override functions in the autocomplete library
[18:19:11] <chee> help tickling the police://
[18:19:18] <abjorn> Why would you want to, elitecoder? Either way, though, $.fn.method = whatever;
[18:19:38] <chee> www actually stands for web web web
[18:19:42] <elitecoder> abjorn: so $.fn.autocomplete._renderItem = fn;?
[18:19:46] <abjorn> rofl chee
[18:19:55] <elitecoder> abjorn: so $.fn.ui.autocomplete._renderItem = fn;?
[18:20:01] <abjorn> That's assuming autocomplete is in the jQuery namespace
[18:20:04] <abjorn> so yes
[18:20:11] <elitecoder> well shit
[18:20:22] <elitecoder> it's a jquery UI thing
[18:20:23] <abjorn> $.fn is just $.prototype
[18:20:38] <elitecoder> that doesn't mean anything to me so I don't understand your point
[18:20:43] <chee> lolo
[18:20:43] <abjorn> LEARN JAVASCRIPT
[18:20:47] <abjorn> DO IT NAO

[18:21:17] <bot-t1> abjorn, Okay.
[18:21:31] <abjorn> bot-t1: tell imsky STOP BEING NOT HERE
[18:21:32] <bot-t1> abjorn, Okay.
[18:21:41] <chee> yes
[18:21:48] <chee> i agree
[18:21:52] <abjorn> sivy, my irc client says your hostname has a smiley face in it ":D"
[18:22:07] <abjorn> you have a happy hostname
[18:22:09] <elitecoder> TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating '$.fn.ui.autocomplete')
[18:22:12] <elitecoder> so it's not that
[18:22:23] <abjorn> It may be different for jq ui
[18:22:27] <tdkedd> duncanbeevers: abjorn: thanks
[18:22:32] <abjorn> np
[18:22:49] <abjorn> I mean, I would assume that's what it should be for jQuery UI, but I guess I'm wrong.
[18:23:23] <elitecoder> yeah me too

[18:24:48] <xodusman> hi anyone familar with Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html.
[18:25:58] <snover> xodusman: I am sure someone is familiar with that.
[18:26:30] <xodusman> i seem to be getting this error while running safari.
[18:27:01] <abjorn> It means the server isn't serving the right mime type.
[18:27:14] <abjorn> If it's apache you can just use a quick rule in the .htaccess
[18:27:30] <abjorn> apache SHOULD be serving the right mime type if it's your standard .jpg, .png, .gif, etc
[18:28:22] <xodusman> i see, not sure why my $.ajax request is working with other browsers, just not ie > ie9 and safari.
[18:28:26] <abjorn> or it could be safari doing what safari does: being shitty
[18:28:53] <abjorn> you're fetching an image with an ajax request?
[18:29:00] <abjorn> i am confuse
[18:29:03] <xodusman> running a query.
[18:29:09] <xodusman> i can share my code.
[18:29:12] <abjorn> werd
[18:29:16] <abjorn> that would help
[18:30:07] <xodusman> http://jsfiddle.net/NJs6Z/
[18:30:28] <abjorn> so
[18:30:32] <abjorn> in safari it's telling you it's an image?
[18:31:18] <xodusman> yes i guess ...
[18:31:26] <abjorn> if you're getting a message in inspector or something saying resource interpreted as image, then it's more likely that it's an actual image than the ajax call
[18:32:58] <xodusman> i was thinking it might have something to do with not getting the response because its not populating my chart with data.
[18:33:33] <snuggs> is there an illustrator guy for bootstrap anyone knows about?
[18:33:35] <abjorn> made sure that the success callback is called?
[18:33:38] <snuggs> gui*
[18:33:48] <snuggs> illustrator gui*
[18:35:21] <xodusman> the success callback is being called, atleast in FF and ie 9.
[18:40:47] <xodusman> not sure if the function is getting the json.response
[18:48:36] <villain_> guys, how can I create this operators -> I'm changing the left(css) value
[18:49:09] <villain_> and this value came from a window.width var
[18:55:37] <villain_> http://dev.estudioignis.com/vos/inc/inc.js
[18:55:40] <villain_> here's the code
[18:58:40] <xodusman> yes i verfied that the callback is being called.
[19:27:24] <tw2113> function shakaka() { alert('kneels down to one knee'); }
[19:34:18] <someprimetime> with load(), i know it grabs the whole page and you can target a selector, but can i tell it stop looking after it finds the selector to return?
[19:34:24] <someprimetime> and not grab everything after it as well?
[19:34:26] <mrkris> is there a way to make the ui autocomplete display text for label and a different id for the value? I keep reading you can but I'm not seeing how :(
[19:34:27] <someprimetime> like just return
[19:34:44] <mrkris> I don't like mongodb id's showing up instead of article name heh
[19:40:33] <heshanh> is it possible to do something like $(this).parent().remove();
[19:45:10] <Eviltwin> heshanh: Sure
[19:46:44] <heshanh> ah, forgot to add live
[19:46:49] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[19:47:11] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[19:47:14] <Eviltwin> Don't use it
[19:47:17] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on instead
[19:49:19] <heshanh> oh
[19:49:23] <heshanh> didnt know that
[19:49:31] <heshanh> same syntax?
[19:49:48] <Eviltwin> No, different syntax
[19:49:57] <Eviltwin> Because the original syntax is misleading
[19:50:08] <heshanh> leme look up jq
[19:50:10] <someprimetime> ey Eviltwin if i'm using load to fetch a specific div, which exists in the middle of the page it's being requested from, is there an option to just stop there and return?
[19:50:27] <Eviltwin> To just stop there?
[19:50:28] <someprimetime> or does it just pull the entire content of the page and then search for the selector to return it
[19:50:34] <LordThumper> $('body').on('click','selector',function () { }) worked for me
[19:51:32] <Eviltwin> It pulls the entire document
[19:51:38] <someprimetime> ah, that's what i thought
[19:51:39] <someprimetime> lame
[19:51:50] <Eviltwin> Well it's not really designed to handle a stream
[19:51:59] <heshanh> hwo do u delegate this. parent?
[19:52:05] <heshanh> http://jsfiddle.net/Q5H5w/1/
[19:52:14] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You can sort of do it with native XHR
[19:52:27] <Eviltwin> But it doesn't really make promises about it
[19:52:43] <Eviltwin> And is tricky to tell when that element has finished loading
[19:52:47] <someprimetime> ah alright, thanks
[19:52:52] <Eviltwin> By default when it parses, it's going to assume you just didn't close the tags
[19:52:59] <someprimetime> i'll just use this jenky method until we finish our api and i can just pull straight json
[19:53:19] <someprimetime> ?delegate @ heshanh
[19:53:24] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/Q5H5w/2/
[19:53:25] <someprimetime> no bot-t :(
[19:53:40] <heshanh> oh!
[19:53:41] <LordThumper> heshanh
[19:53:41] <heshanh> i see
[19:53:43] <heshanh> thank you!
[19:54:12] <LordThumper> np, i used live too till today...
[19:54:13] <heshanh> do i have to call it on body?
[19:54:26] <LordThumper> Nearest "stable" parent if possible
[19:54:36] <Eviltwin> It's traditionally done on "document" not "body" for the top level
[19:54:37] <heshanh> oh right ok
[19:54:49] <Eviltwin> document rather, not "document"
[19:55:00] <LordThumper> oh ok didn't know that
[19:55:21] <Eviltwin> But you're right about the parent
[19:55:41] <Eviltwin> If you're interested in something like "table#mytable a.external"
[19:55:46] <fission6> anyone have a tutorial or rec for infinite scrolling
[19:55:50] <Eviltwin> And #mytable is static and doesn't change
[19:55:56] <someprimetime> http://learninglamp.wordpress.com/2010/01/30/endless-scrolling-with-jquery/
[19:56:01] <someprimetime> @ fission6
[19:56:04] <fission6> thanks someprimetime
[19:56:07] <Eviltwin> Doing $("#mytable").on("click", "a.external", function() { ... }) is better
[19:56:11] <someprimetime> np
[19:56:26] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: How is the event handler attached to the element?
[19:56:37] <LordThumper> Does it "pulse" continuously every interval?
[19:56:58] <LordThumper> Attaching to elements matching selectors?
[19:57:59] <LordThumper> No idea how event delegation works...
[20:00:55] <Kocho> hey guys, i want to have an image of a map and then designate points on the map where the user can click to bring up information in a bubble sort of thing - any ideas? sort of like google maps but without the google map itself
[20:21:55] <danzik17> LordThumper: ?g event bubbling
[20:22:03] <danzik17> bah, google event bubbling
[20:22:12] <danzik17> Eviltwin: whats the bot-t shortcut?  you're the master of that.
[20:22:30] <oojacoboo> at what point does using each(function() {}); become faster than just selecting elements within a container
[20:22:37] <oojacoboo> anyone done any tests on this?
[20:23:01] <danzik17> oojacoboo: what do you mean?
[20:23:35] <oojacoboo> umm… I'm not really sure how to make that anymore clear
[20:23:40] <oojacoboo> are you just trolling me?
[20:24:43] <danzik17> no.  but, good luck - hope you find your answer.
[20:25:16] <oojacoboo> .find('element').whatever();  --VS-- .find('element').each(function() { $(this).whatever(); });
[20:25:20] <oojacoboo> that's what I'm talkinga bout
[20:25:50] <oojacoboo> at what point do you get a benefit with .each() over just selecting and applying to all the elements
[20:26:57] <danzik17> then the answer is, there is almost no benefit.  most functions on the jquery prototype call this.each internally.
[20:27:33] <oojacoboo> I see
[20:33:23] <chee> ?g
[20:33:41] <chee> danzik17: there IS no bot-t
[20:34:10] <danzik17> what the.....that lazy sack of...

[20:39:06] <tw2113> chee is a terminator?
[20:41:20] <chee> Nice night for a walk.
[20:41:33] <crankharder> is there a difference between .click() and .trigger('click')
[20:41:33] <crankharder> ?
[20:42:10] <heshanh> i think 1st one captures a click, 2nd one if u wana manual trigger the click without clicking it
[20:42:49] <chee> click() without arguments is just sugar for trigger('click')
[20:42:50] <crankharder> heshanh: both trigger the click event
[20:43:16] <heshanh> well in that case, ive no idea :(
[20:45:26] <chee> crankharder: trigger('click') takes more typing
[20:46:58] <chee> 9 precious key strokes
[20:47:05] <chee> tw2113 wouldn't do it
[21:05:00] <LordThumper> If I do a deep clone of a jQuery plugin object as so -> $(pluginobject).clone(true,true)
[21:05:24] <LordThumper> Should that save the plugins state exactly?
[21:06:18] <LordThumper> The elements are gettings restored, but the event bindings are not...
[21:06:34] <LordThumper> When I do $(div).replaceWith(pluginobject)
[21:09:15] <LordThumper> If I remove elements created by the plugin manually, should that remove all trace that the plugin has been run?
[21:14:03] <LordThumper> I am using a plugin that doesn't implement a destroy function. I would like to revert back changes made by the plugin, but I don't have time to study what changes the code is doing exactly
[21:32:00] <misteree> semen cum jizz splooge nut seed spunk wad
[21:50:26] <coldhead> so sweepy
[21:51:31] <someprimetime> say i'm loading paginated content on one page (infinitely scrolling and loading it) and i need to keep track of the next page # somewhere.. should i just set a data() element within the page and grab it from that?
[21:51:37] <someprimetime> increment/grab it, that is
[21:52:22] <oojacoboo> yea, or an internal counter
[21:52:41] <oojacoboo> but something in the DOM is a better idea
[21:52:45] <oojacoboo> so you can grab it if need be
[21:53:49] <someprimetime> cool thanks
[21:55:03] <oojacoboo> what am I screwing up here?  questionId = $(this).closest("label").attr("for").replace("question-", "");
[22:03:33] <coldhead> we've all done things we're not proud of
[22:09:35] <oojacoboo> coldhead: you see anyting wrong with this?
[22:09:35] <oojacoboo> questionId = $(this).closest("li select:first").id.replace("question-", "");
[22:09:59] <oojacoboo> I keep getting a TypeError and I'm not quite sure :/
[22:10:36] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect something returned by .closest to have an id
[22:10:41] <coldhead> .attr('id') ?
[22:11:03] <oojacoboo> actually, I think I know the reason now that I think about it
[22:11:08] <coldhead> toString().replace(...) ?
[22:11:09] <coldhead> oh good
[22:11:15] <coldhead> i'll go back to whoring
[22:11:19] <oojacoboo> ha
[22:14:27] <someprimetime> i'm targeting a container through an ajax request, but i don't want the container it's wrapped in, just all the contents inside of it
[22:14:41] <someprimetime> should i be using contents()?
[22:15:58] <someprimetime> nm
[22:17:19] <oojacoboo> I think html() should suffice
[22:19:47] <tw2113> too much of rafael.js is over my head :D but it's fun to see what i can do
[22:25:00] <oojacoboo> alright, I'm about to go mad… questionId = $(this).closest("label").attr("for").replace("question-", "");
[22:25:05] <oojacoboo> what is wrong with that?
[22:25:21] <oojacoboo> f'ing TypeError
[22:35:03] <LordThumper> oojacoboo
[22:35:08] <oojacoboo> LordThumper:
[22:36:47] <LordThumper> Don't see anything wrong with that
[22:36:50] <LordThumper> One mo
[22:36:59] <oojacoboo> yea, I don't either and I'm about to go mad
[22:37:50] <LordThumper> Try to replace attr with prop
[22:37:57] <LordThumper> While I test it in jsfiddle
[22:38:18] <oojacoboo> 				questionId = $(this).closest("ul li select:first").id.replace("question-", ""),
[22:38:22] <oojacoboo> I've tried that too
[22:38:35] <oojacoboo> I don't think the prop is the issue, I've tested that as well
[22:38:42] <oojacoboo> and toString() since I was geting the typeError
[22:39:29] <oojacoboo> $(el).find("li.availability-list").on("click", "li.flex-item.add a.add-remove", function(event) {
[22:39:34] <LordThumper> What is this giving?
[22:39:35] <LordThumper> $(this).closest("label").attr("for")
[22:39:36] <LordThumper> ?
[22:39:36] <oojacoboo> that's $(this)
[22:39:53] <oojacoboo> for="question-123"
[22:40:04] <oojacoboo> select id="question-123"
[22:44:02] <LordThumper> Why is it working for me?
[22:44:03] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/3aGFp/
[22:44:13] <oojacoboo> LordThumper: I don't know, I got a new selector and it's working
[22:44:22] <oojacoboo> I think $(this) is the issue
[22:44:28] <LordThumper> yeah
[22:44:32] <oojacoboo> but I don't know why
[22:44:34] <LordThumper> $(event.target)
[22:44:41] <LordThumper> maybe that will work different
[22:44:44] <oojacoboo> what's wrong with $(this)?
[22:44:51] <LordThumper> no idea
[22:45:30] <oojacoboo> $(this) is a shortcut to event.target, right
[22:45:34] <Cork> oojacoboo: where are you running this code?
[22:45:38] <Cork> oojacoboo: no
[22:45:51] <oojacoboo> Cork: what do you mean where?
[22:46:12] <oojacoboo> it's within an application :/
[22:46:18] <Cork> i guess its in an event ex click; but on what element is the click bound
[22:46:24] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:46:51] <oojacoboo> $(el).find("li.availability-list").on("click", "li.flex-item.add a.add-remove", function(event) {
[22:46:55] <Cork> oojacoboo: could you include all the relevant html in your pb?
[22:47:00] <oojacoboo> maybe
[22:47:46] <LordThumper> Think $(this) is the element listening, and event.target is the event clicked on ...
[22:47:59] <LordThumper> element clicked on*
[22:48:05] <Cork> ya
[22:48:15] <Cork> except in some of the wrapping solutions
[22:48:21] <Cork> like live, delegate and on
[22:48:37] <oojacoboo> this is .on()
[22:48:42] <oojacoboo> so it'd be the target, no?
[22:48:58] <Cork> oojacoboo: i need to see the html structure
[22:49:10] <Cork> can't give a correct answer without it
[22:49:27] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/GvwVF/
[22:49:32] <oojacoboo> sorry for the shitty paste
[22:50:54] <Cork> oojacoboo: and what element are you binding the event on?
[22:51:03] <oojacoboo> li.availability-list
[22:51:34] <oojacoboo> $(event.target) is no go as well
[22:52:01] <oojacoboo> only works with a clean selector...
[22:52:01] <oojacoboo> questionId = $("li.availability-list label").attr("for").replace("question-", "")
[22:52:28] <Cork> oojacoboo: and the selector is .on('click, '?'
[22:52:35] <oojacoboo> yea
[22:52:41] <Cork> and ? is?
[22:52:47] <oojacoboo> function()
[22:53:15] <oojacoboo> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GvwVF/1/
[22:53:50] <Cork> ok so the this is li.flex-item.add or a.add-remove
[22:54:36] <oojacoboo> not following
[22:55:04] <oojacoboo> it would be the a.add-remove
[22:55:06] <oojacoboo> that'd be the target
[22:55:20] <Cork> oojacoboo: in on if the second argument is a selector
[22:55:30] <Cork> that means its a delegated event
[22:55:36] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/GvwVF/3/
[22:55:38] <Cork> so this will be the element the selector matches
[22:55:53] <Cork> what element are you looking for?
[22:56:00] <Cork> Availability question ?
[22:56:00] <oojacoboo> yes, delegated to the one I chose to bind, no?
[22:56:18] <Cork> oojacoboo: no its not the li element
[22:56:20] <oojacoboo> check out that fiddle
[22:56:32] <oojacoboo> it works, click add
[22:57:30] <oojacoboo> and the one that doesnt' work … http://jsfiddle.net/GvwVF/5/
[22:57:36] <Cork> ok, so you want: $(this).closest('.availability-list').children('top').attr('for') i think
[22:57:59] <oojacoboo> children('top')?
[22:58:10] <Cork> to find the label
[22:58:17] <Cork> closest only look at parents
[22:58:30] <Cork> and that'll only get you the li.availability-list
[22:58:43] <oojacoboo> and is the label not a parent?
[22:58:46] <Cork> from there you need to look for children again
[22:58:48] <oojacoboo> or well… up the DOM
[22:58:49] <Cork> no
[22:59:02] <Cork> oojacoboo: its a parent sibling
[22:59:04] <oojacoboo> so it only finds parents, not siblings of parents
[22:59:07] <oojacoboo> got it
[22:59:09] <oojacoboo> thanks
[22:59:23] <Cork> label + ul < li  (reverse css)
[22:59:39] <oojacoboo> is that valid?
[22:59:50] <Cork> nope i said reverse :)
[22:59:55] <oojacoboo> yea
[23:00:36] <oojacoboo> thanks for that Cork
[23:00:46] <Cork> oojacoboo: the reason i used children and not .find
[23:00:56] <Cork> is so it only looks at direct children
[23:01:05] <oojacoboo> yea, makes sense
[23:01:07] <Cork> if you need deeper, .find is what you want
[23:01:28] <oojacoboo> yep
[23:02:11] <Cork> oojacoboo: oh, i missed a char before
[23:02:18] <Cork> its children('.top')
[23:02:25] <Cork> sorry about that
[23:02:54] <oojacoboo> oh, ha, I was wondering about that, I was rewriting the whole thing, didn't even know that class was thre
[23:03:09] <oojacoboo> def not gonna use top though, that's subject to change way too easily :P
[23:05:09] <oojacoboo> so Cork you can't pass standard css selectors to closest?
[23:05:28] <oojacoboo> only single objects?
[23:06:30] <LordThumper> Ofcourse you can
[23:06:45] <oojacoboo> well, that appears to be the issue I had
[23:07:05] <oojacoboo> $(this).closest("parent sibling")
[23:07:07] <oojacoboo> that was a no go
[23:07:35] <oojacoboo> $(this).closest("parent").children("sibling") is the go
[23:07:47] <LordThumper> Cannot use parent in selector
[23:08:07] <oojacoboo> ?
[23:08:17] <LordThumper> oh parent is a class?
[23:08:20] <oojacoboo> yes
[23:08:27] <oojacoboo> just stating their relationship ;)
[23:08:40] <LordThumper> $(this).closest("parent") selects the parent
[23:08:48] <oojacoboo> yes
[23:09:03] <oojacoboo> but you can't put a standard css selector in that closest()
[23:09:15] <LordThumper> $(this).closest("parent sibling")
[23:09:22] <oojacoboo> right, no go
[23:09:28] <oojacoboo> noj workey
[23:09:31] <LordThumper> Tries to find an ancestor with classes parent and sibling
[23:09:50] <oojacoboo> that's NOT what css says ;)
[23:10:04] <LordThumper> Wait I'm not making sense...
[23:10:32] <Cork> oojacoboo: only differense between .find()/$() and .closest, is that closest start at your current element and check the parent chain
[23:10:52] <Cork> this.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode...
[23:10:58] <oojacoboo> yes Cork but that wasn't the issue there really
[23:11:02] <oojacoboo> b/c I was starting with a parent
[23:11:09] <oojacoboo> then from that parent to the parent sibling
[23:11:23] <oojacoboo> that parent's sibling(
[23:11:24] <oojacoboo> **
[23:11:53] <Cork> ya, but you can't reach the label through closest
[23:11:55] <oojacoboo> closest just doesnt' allow you to traverse the DOM with a standard css selector it seems
[23:12:03] <oojacoboo> Cork: right, I get that
[23:12:13] <Cork> it does but only in the parent direction
[23:12:32] <oojacoboo> Cork: that's only 1 time then
[23:12:39] <Cork> so you can select a parent thats a sibling of another element
[23:12:40] <oojacoboo> b/c CSS doesn't go reverse
[23:12:49] <oojacoboo> mmm
[23:12:57] <Cork> but there arn't any css to select a parent of an element
[23:13:00] <oojacoboo> so I can go 2 parents up and selector a parent down
[23:13:15] <Cork> yes
[23:13:19] <oojacoboo> meh, that's just weird :P
[23:13:25] <Cork> as long as all the elements is in the parent chain
[23:13:37] <oojacoboo> yea, I get it now, just not what I was expecting
[23:13:53] <oojacoboo> I'll stick with simple selectors from now on
[23:13:56] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/bfdew/
[23:13:56] <Cork> <ul><li><span></span></li></ul> $('span').closest('ul > li')
[23:14:05] <LordThumper> Worked there
[23:14:13] <oojacoboo> LordThumper: that's not right
[23:14:15] <oojacoboo> one sec
[23:14:42] <Cork> oojacoboo: theres absolutly no reason what so ever to use closest or $(this) to find id elements
[23:14:58] <Cork> they'r uniq on the page anyway, and its faster to just select them
[23:15:04] <oojacoboo> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/bfdew/1/
[23:15:10] <Cork> $('#bar')
[23:15:26] <oojacoboo> Cork: of course, but the id contained a number
[23:15:32] <oojacoboo> which was what I was trying to obtain there
[23:15:42] <oojacoboo> and without knowing that number, it wasn't unique
[23:16:21] <oojacoboo> anyway, we're on the same page now, thanks for clearing all that up
[23:16:40] <Cork> oojacoboo: ya, that comment should prob to at LordThumper
[23:16:53] <Cork> as it was where the id's came from
[23:18:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/bfdew/2/
[23:19:11] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/bfdew/3/
[23:19:20] <LordThumper> That is strange..
[23:19:51] <oojacoboo> LordThumper: Cork just explained why
[23:19:52] <Cork> LordThumper: taht'll still only give you bar, not sibling
[23:19:56] <oojacoboo> it only works with parents
[23:20:02] <oojacoboo> direct
[23:20:23] <LordThumper> Yeah I understand now
[23:20:26] <oojacoboo> I personally think the function should be updated :)
[23:20:31] <LordThumper> Yeah
[23:20:42] <oojacoboo> even if it translates to closest().children()
[23:20:46] <Cork> theres a reason it works the way it does
[23:20:58] <LordThumper> why Cork?
[23:21:17] <Cork> supporting filteringa all elements in the relation with each parent would slow it down many many times
[23:21:27] <Cork> right now its very fast
[23:21:36] <oojacoboo> yea, I agree
[23:21:41] <LordThumper> ok
[23:22:03] <oojacoboo> but that function could use children() if nothing was found :P
[23:22:04] <Cork> if it has to collect all contained elements, it would often end up selecting the entire dom, but in a slower way
[23:22:21] <Cork> oojacoboo: but you might not want that
[23:22:29] <oojacoboo> Cork: if I typed it, I wanted it
[23:22:38] <oojacoboo> that css is very clear
[23:22:45] <oojacoboo> it just doesn't work with jquery
[23:22:46] <Cork> closest('.enabled').length < 1 is and similar is quite common
[23:22:48] <oojacoboo> which is understandable
[23:23:04] <LordThumper> Well, i think sizzle is very powerful as it is..
[23:23:09] <Cork> oojacoboo: it just doesn't work in dom
[23:23:17] <Cork> thats where it all comes from
[23:23:17] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea
[23:24:00] <Cork> what sizzle and jquery adds is an abstraction layer, where not too much speed is sacrifised
[23:24:23] <Cork> but if you start to break the dom rules, performance start to suffer
[23:24:35] <oojacoboo> I can clearly see the degradation that could be had
[23:29:25] <oojacoboo> http://regexpal.com/
[23:29:31] <oojacoboo> <3
[23:30:36] <mindis|wurk> hmmh, could be useful. i've used a java based one before
[23:30:56] <Xotix> hi, http://pastebin.com/zXgDghkv why does this funtion get called twice? For one dblclick i get 2 a's.
[23:30:57] <oojacoboo> it updates on onKeyUp
[23:31:04] <oojacoboo> it's pretty awsum
[23:32:33] <LordThumper> Xotix, try $(document) instead of $(this)
[23:33:49] <Xotix> It's part of a plugin but anyway, it actually worked before. something must disturb it. Can provide a demo atm, hmm.
[23:33:50] <LordThumper> Don't see why that would fire twice anyways, unless you are attaching an event handler twice
[23:40:42] <Cork> Xotix: do you have nested .editor-img elements?
[23:41:50] <Xotix> no. anyway i'll go through my last changes again and t ry to find something stupid :)
[23:41:58] <oojacoboo> availabilityId = $(this).parent().prev().find("select:first").attr("name").replace(/\question\[\d*]\[availability]\[(\d\d?)]\[.*]/g, "$1"),
[23:41:59] <oojacoboo> :P
[23:42:23] <Cork> O_o'
[23:42:32] <oojacoboo> I hate regex
[23:43:03] <Cork> should maybe think about adding a data-id attribute instead
[23:43:05] <mindis|wurk> i hate when people do long lines of code like that
[23:44:00] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea, I guess I could have done that, I figured I'd just grab it out of the array
[23:57:29] <schu> hi there. i need help with an AJAX request: i have a form which, when submitted, sends data via an ajax post to a php file which composes a mail and sends it, then it is supposed to redirect the user to a thank you page. if there is missing or faulty data (e.g. email address incorrect) the user should not be redirected but a notice (data from the PHP passed back to the form / ajax) should be...
[23:57:31] <schu> ...displayed
[23:59:11] <iateadonut> how do i find the next <div class='ab'> after the node <a whatever>...  $(this).nextSomething 'div.ab' ...?
