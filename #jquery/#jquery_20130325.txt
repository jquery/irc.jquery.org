[00:02:06] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: more readable https://gist.github.com/pruhstal/5235375
[00:04:49] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: what is Submission?
[00:05:29] <someprimetime> Submission is a reference to my submission model
[00:05:30] <someprimetime> Submission = require('../models/submission'),
[00:06:07] <eddiemonge> and it has its own addView?
[00:06:24] <someprimetime> it does let me post the model
[00:07:01] <eddiemonge> im at a lost. there is a lot going on it seems
[00:07:11] <someprimetime> https://gist.github.com/pruhstal/5235393
[00:07:16] <someprimetime> those are the methods it references
[00:07:17] <someprimetime> no worries
[00:09:05] <someprimetime> thanks for looking
[00:09:28] <eddiemonge> what do you mean it hangs? as in non-responsive or as in locks up
[00:10:16] <someprimetime> just doesn't return to it's caller in the callback
[00:10:21] <someprimetime> but it's inserting a record in my table
[00:10:27] <someprimetime> so it does actually add the view
[00:10:45] <someprimetime> but upon its callback in the model, it never gets back to the controller calling it
[00:11:46] <eddiemonge> does addview even fire?
[00:12:56] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: it does
[00:12:58] <someprimetime> it is adding the entry
[00:13:25] <eddiemonge> have you tried stepping through it to see where it hangs?
[00:14:20] <someprimetime> yeah
[00:14:23] <someprimetime> i know exactly where it hangs
[00:14:53] <sadtaco> How do I do something after keydown completes?  $(selector).bind('keydown', function(){ // this code runs at the very start.  If you $(this).val('') it still has that key pressed added.. })
[00:15:08] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/pruhstal/5235417
[00:15:19] <Cork> sadtaco: keyup?
[00:15:23] <Cork> or keypress
[00:15:27] <sadtaco> That's not the same.
[00:15:41] <Cork> there is no after event
[00:15:42] <sadtaco> That's when a keyup starts not when a keydown finishes.
[00:15:48] <sadtaco> Maybe I can just settimeout 1ms..
[00:15:51] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: nothing logged?
[00:16:01] <eddiemonge> keypress
[00:16:14] <Cork> sadtaco: that would trigger aprox on the same time as keypress
[00:16:25] <sadtaco> 10ms? :/
[00:16:27] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: it logs if i console.log before submissionView.save({
[00:16:35] <someprimetime> but within the callback, nothing logs
[00:16:47] <Cork> sadtaco: keydown triggers when the button is pressed, same with keypress, with the exception that keypress repeates
[00:16:55] <Cork> sadtaco: what is it your trying to do?
[00:17:04] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: are those the right params?
[00:17:19] <sadtaco> I'm trying to make what someone types in an input box be uppercase.
[00:17:20] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: they are because like i said it does add the entry but i'm not quite sure why it just doesn't return
[00:17:32] <sadtaco> Or rather, clearing it, then having the single key in there be uppercase
[00:17:43] <Cork> sadtaco: ah, you will have to use a hack for that ya
[00:18:23] <sadtaco> So say it has Q in the input, you press "a", it adds and uppercase A.  val('') then making it uppercase 10ms later seems to work though it doesn't look great since you still see the lowercase flash
[00:19:22] <Cork> sadtaco: .on('keypress', function() { var self = this; setTimeout(function() { $(self).val($(self).val().toLocaleUpperCase()); }, 0); });
[00:19:48] <Cork> sadtaco: when the input event becomes cross browser, that is what you want to use
[00:19:52] <sadtaco> That's what I did, except with the .val('') before it
[00:19:55] <Cork> but right now its not
[00:20:02] <sadtaco> and keydown instead of keypress
[00:20:16] <Cork> sadtaco: keydown won't catch key repetitions
[00:20:27] <Cork> ddddddddddddddddddddddd will be Ddddddddddddddddddddddd
[00:20:40] <sadtaco> That's fine. Like I said, only 1 key goes here
[00:20:43] <sadtaco> dddddddddddddddd becomes D
[00:20:56] <Cork> ow
[00:21:14] <Cork> sadtaco: why not just use the charKey?
[00:21:46] <sadtaco> Same thing, no?  Though it does funny things with /[]';' etc
[00:21:57] <Cork> except you don't need the hack
[00:22:03] <sadtaco> No?
[00:22:24] <sadtaco> I don't see how not. Anything in the function applies before the actual keypress
[00:22:49] <sadtaco> so if I did $(this).val().toUpperCase and hit "a" then "foo" would turn to "FOOa"
[00:22:49] <eddiemonge> sadtaco: do you just want to allow only uppercase letters?
[00:22:56] <Cork> .on('keypress', function(event) { $(this).val(event.char); });
[00:22:59] <sadtaco> No I want to convert to uppercase
[00:23:00] <Cork> sadtaco: ^
[00:23:24] <Cork> sadtaco: so .on('keypress', function(event) { $(this).val(event.char.toLocaleUpperCase()); });
[00:23:29] <sadtaco> Are you sure event.char is cross browser?..
[00:24:01] <sadtaco> Doesn't work, Cork
[00:24:01] <djQuery> sadtaco, style="text-transform:uppercase;"
[00:24:14] <sadtaco> Oh that one is good, djQuery
[00:24:20] <sadtaco> But will it work in IE9..
[00:24:31] <eddiemonge> sadtaco: only certain characters or all?
[00:24:37] <Cork> sadtaco: ah, no but String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode) is
[00:25:07] <raj> how are rich text editors made?
[00:25:16] <eddiemonge> with pixie dust?
[00:25:20] <Cork> raj: contentEditable mostly
[00:25:35] <raj> what's the fallback?
[00:25:43] <Cork> fallback?
[00:25:44] <Andrew_R> how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/mq3pv/
[00:25:47] <raj> or whatever the correct term for "fallback" is
[00:25:58] <raj> those hacks that make it work in previous versions
[00:26:01] <raj> of IE
[00:26:02] <Cork> raj: all browsers has supported it for the last 12+ years
[00:26:08] <djQuery> sadtaco, http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/text-transform
[00:26:26] <raj> it's not html5?
[00:26:30] <Cork> no
[00:26:35] <eddiemonge> The text-transform property is supported in all browsers tracked here
[00:26:39] <raj> oh
[00:26:40] <eddiemonge> http://caniuse.com/#search=text-trans
[00:26:42] <Cork> its specked in html5
[00:26:42] <raj> sorry
[00:27:05] <Cork> raj: but much in "html5" was just write down what is defacto standards
[00:27:20] <sadtaco> Okay thanks djQuery that seems good enough
[00:27:28] <raj> k
[00:27:29] <Cork> raj: and side note html5 is just a buzz term
[00:27:38] <Cork> the standard is html
[00:27:55] <Cork> html5 is for marketing and doesn't really mean anything
[00:28:22] <raj> Cork, and what about more formatting than that?
[00:28:26] <Cork> as it includes html, css, video, javascript, jit, and so on
[00:28:41] <Cork> raj: more formating?
[00:29:03] <raj> yeah, highlighting
[00:29:03] <Cork> contentEditable just gives you the means to get input on a normal element
[00:29:17] <Cork> the rest is just normal dom, and js
[00:29:20] <Cork> (and css)
[00:29:25] <Andrew_R> sadtaco: you only want one character in the input box? the CSS solution is probably better, but it is possible with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/mq3pv/1/
[00:29:48] <eddiemonge> what is the point of contentEditable vs textarea?
[00:29:49] <raj> so what needs to be done to allow for highlighting?
[00:29:55] <sadtaco> I'm pretty sure that requires the use of backspace/delete, Andrew_R
[00:30:03] <raj> yes, good question eddiemonge
[00:30:16] <sadtaco> the css way
[00:30:18] <Cork> raj: writing rules to find the words, and wrap them with a tag, and then apply css
[00:30:30] <Andrew_R> yeah the CSS way would
[00:31:23] <sadtaco> is e.charCode working on all browsers?  In my experience, a  lot of the key events are very different on different browsers.
[00:31:52] <Cork> sadtaco: charCode is a bit mixed if i remember correctly keyCode should work though
[00:32:16] <sadtaco> ev.keyCode || ev.which tends to always work afaik
[00:32:35] <Cork> raj: just goodle for syntax highlighting and contentEditable
[00:32:55] <raj> Cork, how do you wrap it in css without causing any shift?
[00:33:11] <Andrew_R> in FF e.keyCode == 0 and both e.charCode and e.which == the correct value
[00:33:12] <Cork> raj: causing shift?
[00:33:18] <raj> visually
[00:33:40] <Cork> raj: ex. add a <span class="syntax css"></span> around the word
[00:33:48] <raj> when you put <p></p> around the word to give it a blue font, or whatever styling
[00:33:50] <Andrew_R> so e.keyCode || e.which should be ok in FF
[00:33:56] <nights> hi
[00:34:20] <nights> does this propagate through to the scope of functions that are called from inside the direct this scope?
[00:34:45] <nights> or is it only valid within jquery function(event){}
[00:34:45] <nights> ?
[00:34:46] <raj> but how can you put that span/p in its exact same position in the paragraph
[00:34:48] <Cork> nights: no this is local to each function
[00:34:57] <nights> ok
[00:35:01] <raj> do you have to apply css to the rest of the paragraph too?
[00:35:01] <nights> so i need to pass in an argument?
[00:35:02] <Cork> raj: what?
[00:35:11] <raj> so nothing shifts
[00:35:30] <Cork> raj: you wind the word, extract the text, add it to a span element and insert the element in the dom
[00:35:36] <Cork> wind==find
[00:36:49] <Andrew_R> nights: you can pass `this` as a parameter, yes
[00:37:54] <Cork> nights: .call and .apply is what sets the this variable
[00:38:12] <Cork> if you want to set it in an inner function (only works if you manually call the function)
[00:40:07] <raj> so Cork, with that said, can you recommend a small clean rich text editor that I can build off of?
[00:40:11] <raj> :)
[00:41:19] <raj> or should I truly build it from scratch?
[00:52:37] <Cork> raj: i like ckeditor, but its not really small :)
[00:53:03] <Cork> raj: but there is literally hundreds out there
[00:53:08] <Cork> just look around for one you like
[01:06:33] <someonewhoisme> when i use success: function(response) {$('#title').text(response);} what else can i do with the response other than printing out all of the text to some element?
[01:07:31] <Cork> someonewhoisme: var domResponse = $(response); domResponse.find('find what ever you like in the dom')
[01:07:40] <Cork> as long as it is html that is
[01:07:49] <someonewhoisme> id like to print out specific elements from the response
[01:08:09] <someonewhoisme> or just pick them
[01:08:52] <someonewhoisme> i was thinking of using xml
[01:08:57] <someonewhoisme> but i don't know how to work with xml
[01:09:28] <someonewhoisme> i mean i don't know how to get stuff from an xml file with jquery
[01:12:07] <Andrew_R> someonewhoisme: use JSON, it's easier to work with
[01:12:40] <someonewhoisme> success is a callback response?
[01:18:27] <nights> hm
[01:19:35] <Cork> someonewhoisme: yes
[01:20:06] <someonewhoisme> how do i use the callback response's function in a way that lets me pick and choose data from what it returns?
[01:20:27] <Cork> someonewhoisme: didn't i show that to you before?
[01:20:32] <Cork> someonewhoisme: var domResponse = $(response); domResponse.find('find what ever you like in the dom') <--
[01:21:13] <someonewhoisme> couldn't i just use a selector?
[01:21:31] <someonewhoisme> but its setting the data to be put inside an element, not picking from an element
[01:21:36] <Cork> that would select in your main dom (as in whats visible)
[01:22:07] <someonewhoisme> $('#title').text(response);
[01:22:20] <someonewhoisme> thats putting all of the data inside the title element
[01:22:21] <Cork> that adds the html as pure text to an element
[01:22:26] <Fuzai> is there a way with jquery to see any form data posted with the link useing the GET method?
[01:22:27] <someonewhoisme> i don't want all of the data to be put into one element
[01:22:39] <Cork> someonewhoisme: so do like i just showed you...
[01:23:04] <Cork> Fuzai: what do you mean?
[01:23:14] <someonewhoisme> i don't get the context
[01:23:19] <Fuzai> something.html?magic_key=blah&
[01:23:26] <Fuzai> i'd like to get the value of magic_key
[01:23:40] <Cork> ah, from the current url you mean?
[01:23:41] <Fuzai> normally i would use $_GET['magic_key'] in php
[01:23:45] <Fuzai> yep
[01:23:56] <Cork> window.location.query
[01:24:01] <Fuzai> ty
[01:24:02] <Cork> opps sorry
[01:24:05] <Cork> its .search
[01:29:08] <Cork> someonewhoisme: if you want to handle the incoming html as a dom tree before appending it to the page, just parse it to a fragment and then search for the section you want
[01:29:29] <Cork> that is what the code i gave you does
[01:49:55] <relipse> how do i get an option element with the value of a select box onchange?
[01:50:56] <raj> Cork, can I add a class to whatever element I'm typing into?
[01:51:46] <raj> so every element has a unique class, for example
[01:58:04] <raj> relipse, $('select').on('change', function() { $(this).val() }
[02:03:05] <amaroks> Hey guys
[02:06:07] <raj> hi
[02:07:13] <amaroks> Hi raj
[02:16:04] <Cork> raj: you can modify the elements to some degree as they are created, but its quite a bit of specifics, so you will have to read up on it
[02:20:13] <dobalina> hey is it straight forward to load sort of like how you would display content through an iframe a seperate page from a site (for example a page on a wp blog) in a div/frame on the same page when you click a link?
[02:20:34] <dobalina> which jquery function should i be looking at to achive that?  load() or something like that?
[02:20:42] <Cork> dobalina: no, as that would be cross domain, and the browser will block you
[02:20:59] <dobalina> well the page is from the same site on teh same domain
[02:21:17] <Cork> $('#target').load('url') then
[02:21:32] <dobalina> it's a form it's just that by default when you click onthe link as it stands it sends you to another page... what i want is to load the contents of tha tpage but without switching pages
[02:21:46] <Cork> ah
[02:21:55] <Cork> then you would have to use ajax
[02:22:05] <dobalina> but the form is associated with a sepcif wp page url
[02:22:08] <Cork> and then from the success event add the response
[02:22:12] <dobalina> that needs to be triggered to generate it
[02:27:11] <dobalina> i basically want to display the contents of a certain wp page within another wp page without having the whole page reload/switch over (sort of like embedding an iframe in the page)
[02:27:38] <Cork> you can't show the hole page, but you can show part of it
[02:29:19] <dobalina> Cork what do you mean?
[02:29:32] <dobalina> that's fine by me
[02:29:38] <Cork> dobalina: if you want the entire page, including its javascript, css and so on
[02:29:44] <Cork> you prob want to use an iframe
[02:29:56] <dobalina> well i really want just an element from within that page
[02:30:07] <Cork> ajax is meant to get partials, though you can filter it to ex. an id on the page
[02:30:07] <dobalina> it's a form embeded on a pgae
[02:30:13] <dobalina> its just that it's associated with that page
[02:30:17] <Cork> ya, like i said before then
[02:30:33] <Cork> dobalina: do you need to do a post to get the form?
[02:30:38] <Cork> else you can just use .load
[02:30:51] <dobalina> nope the form is generated just by accessing the wp url
[02:31:10] <dobalina> it's a plugin which embedes a form via a shortcode that's stuck into a wp page
[02:31:13] <Cork> dobalina: http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[02:31:37] <dobalina> sweet gonna check it out
[02:31:53] <Cork> ...
[02:35:28] <averiso> need help with infinte scroll callbacks and Google DFP

[02:36:25] <LG87> I've got a problem when I try to add a ul with jQuery. If I add the ui with jQuery, it won't apply styles to the li's added (I do call refresh on the ul). But if I create the UL in html, it applies styles to the li's that I add with jQuery. Anyone know why? (I've tryed trigger, create etc).
[02:37:31] <averiso> specifically googletag.display
[02:53:24] <DarsVaeda> what is the way to do .die() in jq 1.9?
[02:53:50] <DarsVaeda> or is it not needed anymore if you use .on?
[03:03:24] <Cork> DarsVaeda: off
[03:03:36] <DarsVaeda> ah okay thanks
[03:03:51] <Cork> bind => unbind, delegate => undelegate, on => off

[03:47:45] <Joestar79> hello everyone
[03:47:53] <Joestar79> I'm struggling to get the document.read() equivalent in a jQuery Mobile site
[03:48:08] <Joestar79> document.ready()
[03:48:31] <Joestar79> is this the right channel to ask for help? or is there a jquery-mobile one?
[03:55:13] <AdamPDotty> look at "onpageshow"
[04:00:51] <philhutchinson> Not really a jquery question, but does anyone know, in an HTML5 app, is there a way to keep a static reference to a photo in the photo gallery?
[04:01:20] <philhutchinson> on iOS
[04:07:35] <aMoniker> philhutchinson: you might have more luck in a channel for iOS development
[04:53:56] <omani_> hi. can I load a whole page into a modal. do I have to use load(url) for this before I fire up the modal? or any other jquery plugin is welcome.
[05:00:03] <omani_> any advice?
[05:02:24] <Kasimir> omani_: easiest way would be to use an iframe
[05:03:03] <omani_> Kasimir: say I have a page. when I click the login button, I want a modal to show up as a "dialog" or something like that.
[05:03:40] <Kasimir> omani_: but you still want to load an external site to the modal?
[05:03:54] <omani_> yes
[05:04:05] <omani_> the login page is different then my base page
[05:04:18] <omani_> I tried simpleModal but I couldn't work with it
[05:06:05] <wereHamster> is there a way to detect if an element has been .remove()'d from the DOM?
[05:06:36] <wereHamster> maybe walk up the children to see if the parents include <body> or <html> ?
[05:06:49] <Kasimir> omani_: hold on a sec on the phone
[05:07:02] <omani_> k
[05:12:44] <MalMen> one question.. on a table by id contact-table how can i remove all the rows except the first one and the last one ?
[05:15:26] <Cork> MalMen: $('#contact-table tr').not(':first, :last').remove()
[05:16:00] <LisaD> @Cork: yup was just trying that!! :)
[05:18:27] <DarsVaeda> I have a div positioned with left and top and inside a div that has position: absolute; this is pregenerated at load and work, but if I swap that code with jquery and jtemplates it does not work anymore, the absolute div is misplaced...sounds familiar?
[05:19:07] <Cork> DarsVaeda: check so classes and style attributes are correct
[05:19:41] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it shouldn't matter much what the template does as long as the generated dom structure is correct
[05:19:55] <Cork> (if it was js it would have been another matter)
[05:22:26] <omani_> Kasimir: I've found a really nice plugin
[05:22:33] <omani_> it's called fanybox
[05:22:43] <omani_> I can load iframes, ajax, swf, everything I need.
[05:23:15] <Cork> fancybox is quite commonly used and well known
[05:26:11] <DarsVaeda> cork: I had a typo in the template and firebug removed it...what a bummer
[05:26:20] <Cork> :D
[05:27:54] <omani_> Cork: good to know.
[05:28:19] <Trudko> guys reason why after i use unbind function f2 is still called? http://jsbin.com/aqitan/1/edit
[05:29:20] <Cork> uh, cause your unbinding before you bind?
[05:29:34] <shoky> but but
[05:30:30] <shoky> maybe he means to ask why f1 is still called?
[05:30:55] <Cork> ah
[05:31:01] <shoky> truuuuuuudkoooooooo
[05:31:16] <Cork> that would be cause your using event attributes (and you shouldn't do that)
[05:31:32] <Trudko> do I ? how i bind f1 in inline then unbind it and bind f2 at least that is plan :)
[05:31:55] <xxyyxx> hello, i want to create a navigation that looks something like the following: http://i.imgur.com/lxOIfnJ.png - a circle in the center and outer rows as navigation tabs next to it - does anyone know if there is something like that out there yet or what the best thing would be to implement it?
[05:31:57] <Cork> Trudko: there are no inline event listeners, those are an old event attribute solution
[05:32:21] <Trudko> Cork: so it order to delete it i need to literraly set onkeyup to "" ? and then bind f2?!
[05:32:28] <Cork> Trudko: event attributes are dom1 spec, and event listeners are dom2, event attributes can't be managed with the event listener commands
[05:32:39] <Cork> Trudko: yes, and that won't always work
[05:32:55] <Cork> but ya removeAttr('onkeyup')
[05:34:20] <MalMen> $(table_data).appendTo("#contacts-table"); this will append to the table i select.. how can i append the content after the firstrow ?
[05:34:29] <MalMen> thanks for your help :)
[05:35:00] <Cork> MalMen: $('#contacts-table tr').first().after(table_data);
[05:36:39] <aMoniker> xxyyxx: The best way to implement it would be to build it yourself.
[05:42:53] <aphoriser> If I am doing: .css(map_var)  …. is there anyway of getting entire css / the same map back?
[05:49:51] <Grundell> I seam to have a problem.... I have a responsive data table that works fine when i have a normal input of it but when i import it by a ajax load it doesnt seam to work at all... is there a reason for this ?
[05:50:19] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/QMC2t/1/ What mistake did i make? Everytime 'position' is undefined.
[05:51:54] <Grundell> Any one ?
[05:52:34] <shoky> Kolorbon: you're not passing position to the that function (you're just passing the callback)
[05:52:57] <Kolorbon> shoky, and how to pass position?
[05:53:23] <shoky> , position
[05:53:51] <Trudko> any  idea why onblure is not replaced ? http://jsbin.com/ixobet/1/edit
[05:53:53] <Trudko> result is derogatoryEvenDate_1 i would expect derogatoryEvenDate_2
[05:53:59] <shoky> Kolorbon:  like this  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QMC2t/2/
[05:54:29] <shoky> Kolorbon: but i'd just do it like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QMC2t/3/
[05:55:01] <angelazou> quick question, is jQuery.post async or sync?
[05:55:26] <shoky> jQuery.post is a shortcut for jQuery.ajax
[05:55:29] <Kolorbon> Async.
[05:55:34] <shoky> a in ajax = async
[05:56:02] <Kolorbon> shoky, why "return"?
[05:56:47] <shoky> Kolorbon:  because $.getJSON returns a promise object that i call .done(...)  on
[05:57:00] <Grundell> Still datatable losses responsiveness when i import it by a ajax .load is there some problem with jquery and ajax when using .load ?
[05:57:01] <shoky> Kolorbon: and just pass the callback there, instead of "manually" like you did.
[05:57:41] <shoky> Kolorbon: er but i see now you want to pass other stuff to the callback
[05:58:19] <omani_> I can't adjust the height of facybox
[05:58:23] <omani_> any hints?
[05:58:44] <omani_> it's always with a scrollbar so I have to scroll. because of the little height
[05:58:47] <Kolorbon> shoky, yes, the outcommanted in the callback.
[05:58:49] <Kasimir> omani_: set autoDimensions to false
[05:58:56] <shoky> Kolorbon: so either do it like my first fiddle, or if you wanna try with the promise thing, i think this should work:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QMC2t/4/
[05:59:22] <omani_> Kasimir: there is only autoheight and autowidth
[05:59:26] <omani_> and it's default to false
[05:59:39] <shoky> actually should be .then instead of .pipe
[05:59:46] <shoky> deprecation and all
[05:59:52] <Kasimir> omani_:http://fancybox.net/api
[06:00:01] <omani_> ok got it. it's autosize which has to be false.
[06:00:04] <omani_> defaults to true.
[06:00:06] <omani_> thanks
[06:00:37] <Kolorbon> Very much thanks, shoky ;)
[06:00:53] <Grundell> do i need to import the jQuery active for the responsive table when i load it with ajax ?
[06:04:48] <Grundell> Really, no one feels like they have the time to help me ?
[06:04:48] <shoky> Trudko:  it did replace
[06:04:55] <shoky> Trudko: it replaced the first occurence
[06:07:46] <Kolorbon> shoky, i discovered, that 'getResearchPointsProductionJSONCallback' is now returning the value itself, thank you 1000 times, because the last days I was searching for this solution, not to need a second function for that.
[06:08:40] <shoky> np Kolorbon
[06:10:19] <seutje> Grundell: not sure I understand the question, but you only need 1 version/instance of jQuery
[06:11:04] <seutje> unless ur creating a window object with a different origin, then you need to load up a separate one in there, but that has very little to do with them ajaxies
[06:11:54] <Grundell>  seutje - The problem im having is that i am importing a datatable by .load($(this).attr("href")) and when i do that it seams that i loose the jQuery for my responsive table. (which works fine from the page im importing it from.)
[06:12:43] <seutje> Grundell: yeah, any javascript operations done on that other page won't automagically happen
[06:12:54] <seutje> I thought u meant the actual library
[06:13:19] <Kolorbon> Uhm, shoki, now I have a problem with that :| http://jsfiddle.net/Kolorbon/2LzE7/ When i put the alert into the function, it works, but outside I get 'undefined' back.
[06:13:30] <Kolorbon> shoky*
[06:13:32] <Grundell> seutje - oh no the javascript on that page... How do i make it happen? (relatively new to jQuery / javascript)
[06:14:15] <shoky> Kolorbon:  you need to use .done(...)  like in my last fiddle
[06:14:20] <seutje> Kolorbon: getJSON is async, returning it's value will -at most- return a promise object
[06:14:29] <seutje> its*
[06:14:47] <seutje> Grundell: copy it over, grab it from the head or write it to be more modular
[06:14:54] <Kolorbon> Ahh.

[06:20:29] <okdamn> i do $()[0] is it ok?
[06:20:45] <yogurt_truck> no
[06:20:52] <shoky> okdamn: that's ok but it will give you a plain DOM element, not a jquery object
[06:20:58] <yogurt_truck> okdamn: $('.class').first()
[06:21:11] <shoky> okdamn: use .eq(0)  or .first() or $('.class:first')  if you want a jq obj
[06:21:30] <okdamn> ok dude
[06:21:40] <okdamn> what about triggering both click and focus on same element?
[06:21:45] <okdamn> i tryed .click().focus()
[06:21:52] <okdamn> but focus is not correct as i can see
[06:22:29] <aphoriser> Anyway to get all > var map = $("#selector").css styles? to re-assign back .css(map) ?
[06:22:43] <shoky> .focus() should work

[06:26:24] <platzhirsch> What was the shortcut for accessing the jQuery element inside a .bind function?
[06:26:43] <shoky> $(this) ?
[06:26:53] <Grundell> seutje:http://jsfiddle.net/WKgFj/2/ seams like im still loading the script but cant get it to work...
[06:27:03] <platzhirsch> shoky: but this returns the document
[06:27:42] <shoky> platzhirsch: then cache it before your nested callback. e.g.  $('button').bind('click', function() { var elem = $(this);  ...... });
[06:28:06] <platzhirsch> shoky: ok, sure! thanks
[06:28:13] <seutje> Grundell: so u load the script, upon loading it u bind a click handler and upon clicking u load the table>
[06:28:14] <seutje> ?
[06:28:35] <seutje> Grundell: and the script you load first should affect the table you load last?
[06:29:03] <Grundell> i want the click to be the trigger to loading and importing the script... then the table should load...
[06:29:50] <seutje> Grundell: why do you think the script should load before the table?
[06:30:32] <Grundell> seutje: because the script affects the table being loaded? there for i load it first to get it and then i load the table...?
[06:30:42] <seutje> if the script target the table, you're obviously gonna need it after the table
[06:30:45] <seutje> targets
[06:31:55] <Grundell> okay, so i should do the get script inside the click function =?
[06:32:32] <seutje> I guess, or the callback for loading the table
[06:33:59] <Grundell> seutje: okay how do i do this the most efficient way ?
[06:35:21] <Grundell> seutje: sorry if im a bit clueless...
[06:36:16] <seutje> Grundell: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/WKgFj/3/
[06:36:28] <seutje> prolly more efficient ways
[06:37:43] <Grundell> seutje: okay... tried the code, doesnt seam to load the script still...
[06:38:16] <seutje> yeah it does
[06:38:19] <seutje> I can see it loading
[06:38:30] <seutje> and I can see it erroring out cause it requires jquery UI widget factory
[06:39:14] <seutje> object function.... has no method 'widget' ...
[06:39:18] <Grundell> seutje: ah okay, and how do i make this UI widget factory ?

[07:48:27] <aragon83> should i be making a method to attach clicks to a selector?  sometimes i wonder if i should make everything into a separate method
[07:49:16] <pachet> aragon83: depends on what you're using it for
[07:50:31] <aragon83> so i have a bunch of slides on my page, and i want to add behaviour to them when they are clicked
[07:51:02] <aragon83> ive done it in the past, by adding a method like attachClick(), but i just find it clunky, or am i right to do it ?
[07:53:17] <omani_> like this one http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0PHMG9K
[07:53:24] <omani_> http://wbpreview.com/previews/WB0PHMG9K/

[07:55:33] <aragon83> http://jsfiddle.net/ywpp5/
[07:55:44] <aragon83> should i be making $day a global variable to the function?
[07:56:10] <aMoniker> Trudko: you need to use the global flag 'g' in your regex
[07:57:20] <Trudko> aMoniker: how do i seperate them i tried mg didnt work
[07:58:36] <aMoniker> Trudko: not sure... I don't think order should matter
[07:58:38] <ePax> With mobile jquery how can i close window? browser?
[07:58:58] <aMoniker> Trudko: also, you can just do var pattern = /^(.*?)derogatoryEventDate_1(.*?)$/mg;
[07:59:24] <Trudko> aMoniker: in my app derogatoryEventDate_1 is stored in var
[07:59:40] <aMoniker> Trudko: oh sorry, wasn't paying close enough attention
[08:00:00] <Trudko> aMoniker: no problem it is not clear from pseudocode
[08:00:16] <shoky> Trudko: http://jsbin.com/akewug/2/edit
[08:01:09] <Trudko> shoky: ou so  ^(.*?) does not apply for non existente
[08:01:53] <shoky> what?
[08:03:00] <ePax> Does anyone know how to close window in jquery?
[08:03:14] <aro> epax: why not just use js?
[08:03:21] <aro> window.close()
[08:03:55] <aro> is there a best way to handle multi-path show/hide (delayed-create) type stuff?
[08:04:36] <aro> suppose we have 2 different select boxes, and different combinations of those options show a different message below
[08:08:59] <omani_> how does this site do it?
[08:09:02] <omani_> http://wbpreview.com/previews/WB0PHMG9K/index.html
[08:09:26] <omani_> I know it's kind of a fadeOut fadeIn thing. but from where do the circles come from
[08:09:29] <omani_> -from
[08:09:43] <aro> looks like hicharts or something
[08:09:56] <aro> prolly svg
[08:10:00] <omani_> aro: I mean the webpage load
[08:10:26] <epax> it doesnt seems to work with windo.close()
[08:10:30] <epax> window*
[08:10:44] <omani_> if you load the webpage. all content fades out, then there are circles which indicate loading progress
[08:10:48] <omani_> you know?
[08:10:55] <aro> an overlay with opacity?
[08:11:10] <omani_> aro: yeah but where do the circles come from?
[08:11:15] <omani_> can you find it in the source code?
[08:11:23] <omani_> I've been trying to do this can't figure it out
[08:12:08] <aro> yes
[08:12:11] <aro> i found it

[08:13:11] <aro> its css animation
[08:13:13] <omani_> where do I type that in?

[08:20:59] <MalMen> yes, i tryed, but i found to name for example
[08:21:05] <MalMen> not for ids
[08:21:28] <MalMen> for name i can use for example [name^="value"]
[08:21:37] <aro> $("[id^=jander]")
[08:21:50] <aro> will select all that start with 'jander'
[08:22:30] <MalMen> hmmm, seems simple. my doubt its because for ids usualy i use #
[08:22:35] <MalMen> thank you :)
[08:22:47] <aro> did it work?
[08:22:53] <MalMen> will try now

[08:40:03] <Selenaa> Can anyone guide me a little how i can achieve that?
[08:41:22] <Selenaa> and you remove the overlay on the <body>
[08:41:35] <Selenaa> So something similar that works in Jquery, if anyone would appreciate
[08:41:48] <BillCriswell> aragon83: You want the clicks to not work while it's animating?
[08:42:27] <aragon83> i want the clicks to work while animating
[08:43:26] <BillCriswell> aragon83: Click events will still work on elements while they're anmating.
[08:44:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ucimoc/1/edit quick demo of it workking.
[08:45:32] <aragon83> weird, i think its because i'm adding a class, and it doesn't update the dom until its finished updating
[08:45:49] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/VkMj9/
[08:46:04] <kristofers> it only adds the class
[08:46:07] <kristofers> and don't remove it
[08:46:39] <BillCriswell> kristofers: There are you siblings to those a element.
[08:47:17] <BillCriswell> You want the parent <li> siblings and their <a> children.
[08:47:41] <kristofers> i'm using isotope jquery library
[08:47:51] <kristofers> and i want to add an Active class
[08:47:56] <kristofers> and remove it on the others
[08:47:59] <BillCriswell> That doesn't change a thing.
[08:48:00] <kristofers> so that i can style it accordingly
[08:48:49] <BillCriswell> kristofers: http://jsfiddle.net/VkMj9/1/ might be your best bet.

[08:54:48] <Stephen_> Hi Aro, I'm using the Validate plugin and have run into an issue that I can't figure out. Think you can assist?
[08:55:11] <aro> i can try
[08:55:14] <aro> whats the issue
[08:55:25] <BillCriswell> Stephen_: Best bet it just to ask.
[08:57:49] <Stephen_> ok, I've added a method to flag default values that are left in the field (found method via some googling) but it is giving me the following error: Error: TypeError: e.validator.methods[o] is undefined
[08:58:00] <aro> link?
[08:58:12] <aro> sounds like you are tyrying to access an array by an object as a key
[08:58:46] <Stephen_> http://37.220.92.92:81/Apply-for-finance-online.asp
[08:59:39] <Stephen_> if i remove everything relating to "defaultInvalid" then there are no issues so it's definitely something to do with that that
[09:00:11] <aro> have you tried figuring otu what index you are accessing with
[09:00:27] <Stephen_> nope
[09:01:06] <Stephen_> just followed the instructions online to achieve that I wanted and it's not working
[09:04:18] <BillCriswell> Stephen_: Why not use placeholder?
[09:04:50] <Stephen_> can you elaborate please Bill?
[09:06:24] <BillCriswell> You can put placeholder="John Smith" on an <input> or <textarea> and it'll show up looking like it's typed it, but it's really not, so you wouldn't have to go through elements and make sure it's not the default text that was in there
[09:07:29] <Stephen_> I see, OK let me go check that out and see if that will work for me.  Many thanks Bill and Aro
[09:07:34] <jackw411> hey guys, im trying to append an onsubmit attribute to an input but keep getting a SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[09:07:46] <jackw411> jQuery("#submit_cardsave_payment_form").attr("onsubmit", "_gaq.push(["_linkByPost", this]);");
[09:08:01] <jackw411> on that line - any idea?
[09:08:16] <BillCriswell> Stephen_: No problem. It's just much easier to handle in the long run.
[09:08:46] <BillCriswell> Stephen_: You'll still need to see if it's empty or not, but you won't have to worry about doing if ( name === 'Joe Example' ) and so on.
[09:09:45] <BillCriswell> jackw411: Escape the " in the second argument on attr.
[09:10:12] <BillCriswell> Or do '_gaq.push(["_linkByPost", this]);'
[09:14:14] <Stephen_> BillCriswell: Will the placeholder approach work in older browsers?
[09:14:32] <BillCriswell> Stephen_: You can use a polyfill for it, there's plenty of them around.
[09:21:13] <aragon83> BillCriswell: this is strange behaviour.  It seems like chrome doesn't like clicks during hovers/animations.  it works as i should expect in IE, ironically.
[09:21:48] <jackw411> BillCriswell : yeah thanks, I converted it to unicode and sorted it out, thanks
[09:22:17] <BillCriswell> aragon83: Without an example it's hard to say why it might be being weird.
[09:23:56] <zfly9> Anyone know what plugin they're using on this site for the large black line & red box?
[09:24:00] <sunbeam> i'd like to conditionally load a stylesheet with certain media query when the device opening is *any tablet*
[09:24:03] <sunbeam> if it's not, another stylesheet should be loaded
[09:24:06] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[09:27:08] <Selenaa> Anyone worked before with Modal Window? tried to reproduce something similar to pinterest?
[09:27:20] <zfly9> Anyone know what plugin they're using on this site for the large black line & red box? https://mahifx.com/
[09:31:56] <Andrew_R> zfly9: looks like it's all custom
[09:33:51] <zfly9> Andrew_R crap!
[09:39:49] <Trudko> guys I m using selector $("[id^='someIndex'] :gt( 1)"); $("[id^='someIndex']).size(); returns 4 $("[id^='someIndex'] :gt( 1)").size(); returns 251 how is that possible? I am using old version of jquery(1.4.4 I have to)
[09:40:07] <Trudko> cant provide html yet I am just courios if I did not do some obvious error
[09:42:21] <Narhir> Hi
[09:43:11] <Andrew_R> Trudko: does .length give you the same results?
[09:44:12] <bluesm> Can I be sure about the order of "collection"
[09:44:29] <bluesm> That it would be "sibling after sibling" ?
[09:44:56] <Narhir> I have a problem with jQuery + Infinite scroll
[09:44:56] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/uQjZ4/
[09:45:12] <Narhir> I have boxes that shows up like those with infinite scroll, but only the FIRST boxes work with this function :(
[09:45:23] <Narhir> any idea ow to change it so it would work with newly loaded boxes as well ?
[09:48:57] <Trudko> Andrew_R: yes I though that  with gt it cant be more
[09:49:18] <Andrew_R> Trudko: your selectors work here: http://jsfiddle.net/yFWSg/
[09:49:21] <shoky> Trudko:  "[id^='someIndex'] :gt( 1)"   selects elements that are descendants of  [id^='someIndex']
[09:50:05] <shoky> maybe you meant  "[id^='someIndex']:gt(1)"
[09:50:41] <Trudko> shoky yes you are right
[09:52:10] <Andrew_R> Trudko: try $("[id^='someIndex']").slice(1)
[09:52:43] <Trudko> Andrew_R:  shoky was right I did not realize that extra white space before  gt means descendants
[09:53:41] <Andrew_R> Trudko: I see... I didn't notice the space, but yes that would do it.
[09:54:30] <aragon83> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/uceren/1/
[09:54:41] <aragon83> sometimes the class "is-open" isn't added when clicked
[09:54:52] <Narhir> help m,e guys
[09:54:53] <Narhir> :(
[09:55:10] <Trudko> Andrew_R shoky isnt jquery using > for such cases why is white space  spec character ?
[09:55:43] <shoky> > is _direct_ descendants
[09:55:46] <shoky> space is any descendants
[09:56:20] <tubbo> Trudko: it's just like CSS.
[09:56:49] <BillCriswell> aragon83: I can't click it without it adding it.
[09:57:15] <Trudko> tubbo shoky i see thanks!
[09:57:16] <aragon83> hmmm weird
[09:58:47] <aragon83> only happens may be 20% of the time
[09:58:53] <BillCriswell> aragon83: http://jsbin.com/uceren/2/edit when I click one as it's going up the background color changes every time.
[10:00:05] <aragon83> yeah, weird
[10:00:18] <aragon83> i wonder if it could be the content within the animating div that somehow stops it from propagating
[10:00:41] <Mosselmaniac> hi all. i'm lost at the moment. i use:  $(function(){ $(".variabelText, .variabelTextArea").htmlarea(); }); to change a textarea into a htmlarea (js library).
[10:01:07] <Mosselmaniac> but on the same page i have an ajax call, which pops up some content (in fancybox) with several textarea's on it.
[10:01:17] <Mosselmaniac> i need them to be htmlareas too
[10:02:18] <Mosselmaniac> so i wanted to live bind that function, but i'm lost how-to
[10:02:22] <Mosselmaniac> can somebody help me?
[10:04:36] <tubbo> Mosselmaniac: since htmlarea() is a plugin, you might not be able to do that without modifying the plugin code.
[10:06:25] <rael> When adding list items insertAfter or appendTo , how do I get the additions to persist on reload? do I need an ajax call to update the html file
[10:07:22] <Mosselmaniac> tubbo: ok.....
[10:07:56] <jcp_> In this example, is it possible to wrap the <!-- this could be anything --> comment in a div tag? http://jsfiddle.net/fHFMh/
[10:08:29] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/uQjZ4/ <-- popups stop to show up after combining them with "Infinite scroll" please help
[10:08:46] <Narhir> I mean overall, only the newly loaded popups doesnt work*
[10:08:50] <dexec> Hi everyone! Could some of you fine folks please take a look at this small datepicker problem I'm having? - http://jsfiddle.net/gcFuW/
[10:09:01] <tubbo> Mosselmaniac: you could, however, do a `<script> $('.variableText, .variableTextArea').htmlarea(); </script>` at the bottom of your ajax calls to hack it for now
[10:09:14] <tubbo> Mosselmaniac: that is, the bottom of the ajax response
[10:09:20] <tubbo> not IN your $.ajax definition
[10:10:21] <Selenaa> HOW can i make my div to ignore the scrollbar size
[10:10:35] <Selenaa> so it stay in same place either if there is a scroll bar either not.
[10:10:42] <Mosselmaniac> tubbo let me try
[10:12:52] <Mosselmaniac> tubbo: that doesn't work.
[10:12:56] <Mosselmaniac> doesn't do anything.
[10:13:04] <Mosselmaniac> i'm spending hours on it already. getting seriously crazy now.
[10:13:40] <jcp_> basically, i always know $('.row') and $('#form') exist. However, I won't know what's in-between the two but I need to isolate it and wrap them in a div. I guess I'm asking if you can isolate content between a parent and child. http://jsfiddle.net/fHFMh/
[10:15:07] <tubbo> Mosselmaniac: oh btw in my example i corrected your spelling of "variable" because it was wrong. your spelling is ".variabelTextArea" and mine was ".variableTextArea"
[10:15:17] <Mosselmaniac> lollll
[10:15:23] <tubbo> Mosselmaniac: you should probably change that so you don't look like you just graduated from elementary school ;)
[10:15:41] <Mosselmaniac> which i didn't :p
[10:15:57] <Mosselmaniac> omg, did I just wrote a smiley?
[10:16:47] <Mosselmaniac> tubbo: it works (i had this result before), but the textarea is f*cked
[10:16:59] <Mosselmaniac> i can't click inside of it, but it renders like a WYSIWYG editor
[10:17:44] <jcp_> nm, figured it out, $('.row').contents().slice[0]
[10:19:33] <Mosselmaniac> that thing just erros
[10:19:34] <Mosselmaniac> errors
[10:19:35] <Mosselmaniac> argh
[10:20:48] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/uQjZ4/ <-- popups stop to show up after combining them with "Infinite scroll" please help - I mean overall, only the newly loaded popups doesnt work*
[10:23:07] <aragon83> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/uceren/3/
[10:23:14] <aragon83> you might have to try it multiple times
[10:23:21] <aragon83> but a few clicks don't change the bg colour
[10:23:44] <BillCriswell> aragon83: Working consistently here on my mac.
[10:24:05] <aragon83> are you using Chrome ?
[10:26:54] <anew> what is a lit of all .on() parameters i can use ?
[10:27:42] <aMoniker> anew: pretty much all the normal js events
[10:27:53] <aragon83> i think i'm going nuts over this small problem
[10:27:54] <anew> whre is a list of those ?
[10:28:10] <BillCriswell> aragon83: Yes.
[10:28:11] <aMoniker> anew: what have you found on google?
[10:28:23] <BillCriswell> Are you saying that sometimes when you click the div it doesn't change color?
[10:28:37] <aragon83> yeah
[10:28:59] <BillCriswell> Try restarting chrome. It doesn't always help but it might.
[10:29:10] <aragon83> it seems to work consistently, if i change the animation speed from 1000 to 3000
[10:29:59] <anew> lol
[10:30:24] <aragon83> hrm, it seems to happen 60% of the time now
[10:34:44] <aragon83> BillCriswell: i fixed it by firing it on mousedown, instead of using the click helper
[10:35:19] <aragon83> tres weird
[10:36:26] <rael> setting a button icon with jquery ui ->     $("#radio1").button( { icons: {primary:'ui-icon-gear',secondary:'ui-icon-triangle-1-s'} } );
[10:36:39] <rael> how can you set an icon on <span> ,  with addClass() ?
[10:37:10] <gates_> I am trying to chase down a Google Analytics issue with jQuery Mobile

[10:38:16] <gates_> it seems like its reporting the current pages slug, not hte next
[10:44:11] <Selenaa> how to append a #container in another container?
[10:44:22] <Selenaa> $('#test').appendTo('#simplemodal-overlay');
[10:44:24] <Selenaa> tried this but doesn't work
[10:44:32] <djQuery> Selenaa, it should
[10:44:42] <djQuery> ?demo
[10:44:42] <b-ot> djQuery: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:44:54] <djQuery> hate android browser
[10:45:39] <Selenaa> That's all the code "djQuery". I have a modal window that is <div class="opacity"></div> <div class="container"></div>
[10:45:43] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ezafik/2    it the input is a text input it works fine if type="number" the blur wont trigger when hitting the next button on the number pad
[10:46:00] <Selenaa> Now i just want that the opacity class to end after the container and not before
[10:46:07] <Selenaa> <div class="opacity"> <div class="container"></div></div>
[10:46:11] <Selenaa> This way
[10:46:33] <djQuery> Selenaa, so it is an issue whith your cascading style sheet then
[10:47:02] <djQuery> container is going to inherit the opacity of it container
[10:47:08] <gates_> _|Nix|_: you around?
[10:47:30] <Selenaa> So you mean i write correctly the appendTo?
[10:47:34] <djQuery> div.opacity>div  { opacity: 0}
[10:47:38] <Selenaa> and its just a css issue?
[10:48:06] <djQuery> Selenaa, did you inspect the html to verify that it actualy moved the div?
[10:48:33] <djQuery> can you do div.opacity>* does that work?
[10:48:48] <Selenaa> Not sure how to do that, i just added "$('#simplemodal-container').appendTo('#simplemodal-overlay');" in my Javascript.js
[10:49:03] <Selenaa> let me use the jsfiddle to put you all
[10:49:06] <Selenaa> and you can check exactly
[10:51:01] <djQuery> Selenaa, right-click inspect element if you are using chrome
[10:52:15] <djQuery> Selenaa, if you don't know how to do that then try this http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/
[10:52:25] <djQuery> Selenaa, or see ?ftjq
[10:52:33] <djQuery> damn lazy bot
[10:52:47] <djQuery> `ftjq@selenaa
[10:53:03] <djQuery> both of them probably out making more bots
[10:54:04] <Selenaa> :D
[10:54:15] <djQuery> Selenaa, you could just leave them where they are by the way and just make the container appear on top of the opacity
[10:54:17] <Selenaa> w8 i moment soon done, i msut add the external library
[10:54:22] <Selenaa> for the modal window on jsfiddle
[10:54:24] <gf3> djQuery: What's ftjq?
[10:54:40] <Selenaa> you think so :P nah
[10:54:49] <Selenaa> i must have it included in the opacity because i need scroll
[10:54:54] <djQuery> then you dont have to worry about it inhereting the opacity
[10:54:56] <djQuery> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:54:58] <Selenaa> and the opacity box is full screen
[10:55:07] <gf3> `ftjq is http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:55:07] <b-ot> gf3: memorised “ftjq”.
[10:56:17] <djQuery> Selenaa, by the way, the way that I outlined it above is the way that jquery.ui.dialog does it
[10:56:27] <Selenaa> Let me explain you what i want to do, yes its something similar you showed me there, but not quite.
[10:56:28] <djQuery> the dialog div is not in the overlay
[10:56:59] <djQuery> `ui.dialog@selenaa
[10:57:14] <Selenaa> When i open that Modal Window, the body will get set the "overflow to hidden" and my opacity div which will be also the owner of the container div will ahve a scroll bar
[10:58:07] <Selenaa> Hard to explain :|
[10:58:19] <Selenaa> but if you check pinterest.com if you have an account
[10:58:24] <Selenaa> you can see what exactly i talk about
[10:58:45] <djQuery> nope have seen the need
[10:59:18] <sunbeam> how to detect a tablet browser?
[10:59:27] <sunbeam> (by device etc, not by resolution)
[10:59:35] <gf3> djQuery: For b-ot use `api
[10:59:44] <gf3> djQuery: Although I don't know that it's aware of jqUI stuff
[10:59:47] <Selenaa> So then how can i achieve that? without putting the overlay div as a father to the container div ( the modal window )
[10:59:48] <gf3> `api on
[10:59:48] <b-ot> gf3: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:00:51] <Selenaa> http://jsfiddle.net/BD4c4/ check here djquery
[11:01:00] <djQuery> gf3, will go through an put all the `api ui.whatever in there some time
[11:01:10] <bluesm> Is there a way to set variable
[11:01:12] <Selenaa> tho, i don't have the simplemodal included so it wont show much
[11:01:15] <bluesm> to all of the items ?
[11:01:19] <Selenaa> but you see the concept ;p
[11:01:21] <bluesm> (in collection ?)
[11:01:36] <bluesm> (without each method) ?
[11:02:10] <djQuery> bluesm, $('input').data('test', 'YEAH');
[11:02:34] <djQuery> bluesm, that will set all the inputs to have a data attribute of test = to YEAH
[11:02:52] <rael> anyone made ajax() calls in .net
[11:02:54] <bluesm> djQuery: Thank you very much :)
[11:03:10] <djQuery> bluesm, HOWEVER   $('input').data('test')   will only return the value of the FIRST input it finds
[11:03:32] <bluesm> djQuery: There is list of methods that do NOT work on collections ?
[11:03:33] <djQuery> rael, I am sure someone has see `ask
[11:04:12] <djQuery> bluesm, what do you mean ? , there is a difference between getting and setting
[11:04:36] <bluesm> djQuery: I see. But I was said that "almost all methods work on collections"
[11:04:43] <bluesm> djQuery: But I wonder what doesn't.
[11:04:50] <djQuery> in most time when you are returning some text or value it will only return the text or value of the first one
[11:05:51] <djQuery> bluesm, there is a difference between getters and setters
[11:06:38] <Selenaa> djQuery, can you take a look at "http://jsfiddle.net/BD4c4/" tell me if you have any idea how i could make it work.
[11:06:45] <djQuery> bluesm, setters allways work on collections,  however getters that are returning something that is not an object or html element will only work on the 1st item in the array
[11:07:05] <bluesm> djQuery: Ok. I see. Thank you very much :))
[11:07:37] <djQuery> <input name="test"><input name="wow">   $('input').attr('name');   will return just the text test
[11:08:11] <bluesm> djQuery: But if I need reference to "the element" I have to use "each"
[11:08:18] <djQuery>  rael I don't do im
[11:08:20] <bluesm> djQuery: I mean when I want "this" keyword.
[11:08:52] <djQuery> bluesm, wll if you are setting each one to a different value then yes
[11:09:23] <bluesm> djQuery: :) Thanks :)
[11:09:25] <djQuery> Selenaa, can you add some html to it and save and send it again
[11:10:28] <djQuery> Selenaa, and if you want it to work you need to include the modal plugin
[11:10:37] <Selenaa> yes
[11:10:39] <Selenaa> doing that now :P
[11:13:45] <djQuery> gotta get the brisket on back in a few
[11:14:21] <djQuery> does jsfiddle have something like /latest    like jsbin does?
[11:15:06] <geoous> http://jsfiddle.net/fyngB/
[11:15:11] <geoous> what is wrong there?
[11:15:22] <geoous> I want to click on the input and "Search" disappear
[11:17:12] <rael> If i can't use <form> tags , is there another way I can create jquery ui dialog
[11:20:26] <Selenaa> djQuery, there you go  -> http://jsfiddle.net/BD4c4/1/
[11:20:48] <Selenaa> tho, it doesn't run properly no clue why but you can understand
[11:20:51] <Selenaa> what it happens there
[11:21:06] <geoous> Selenaa: can you take a look to this please: http://jsfiddle.net/fyngB/
[11:21:14] <geoous> I want to click on "Search" and it disappear
[11:21:22] <Selenaa> ok w8
[11:21:26] <mitzev_> guys, how do i get the current ID of the clicked item
[11:21:42] <mitzev_> i have a ul with li's, want to get the id of the clicked li
[11:22:29] <djQuery> Selenaa, Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'modal'
[11:23:01] <Selenaa> how comes? i included the .js for the modal
[11:23:08] <Selenaa> geoous, checking it 1 moment
[11:23:36] <djQuery> mitzev_, $('li').on('click', function(){ console.log(this.id);   console.log($(this).attr('id');});
[11:23:55] <djQuery> mitzev_, of course this.id is preferable
[11:24:51] <djQuery> Selenaa,  http://www.ericmmartin.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/emm-v3/scripts/jquery.simplemodal.js 404 (Not Found)
[11:25:23] <Selenaa> djQuery, you serious? i am on it now reading the js
[11:25:38] <Selenaa> djQuery, how is possible?:-s i can screen for you if you want
[11:26:01] <mitzev_> k thx djQuery
[11:27:17] <geoous> Selenaa: so have you found the problem on it?
[11:29:01] <Selenaa> geoous, yes fixed it for you
[11:29:11] <Selenaa> geoous, http://jsfiddle.net/fyngB/2/
[11:29:47] <Selenaa> djQuery, i have no idea why its not including it since i included it :| and it works the link properly
[11:31:32] <Selenaa> geoous, Does it work for you?
[11:32:11] <geoous> Selenaa: Yes thank you, how do you do if I want to click outside the input and appear 'Search' again?
[11:38:19] <marcogmonteiro> geoous you can use a html5 property of input forms, placeholder="search"
[11:38:26] <marcogmonteiro> that will not work on older browsers thou
[11:40:52] <nactus_> hi guys, does anyone have a second to give me a hand with a jquery function ?
[11:47:27] <djQuery> geoous, look for an html5 shim   it will fix that older browsers dont support  <input placeholder="search" />
[11:48:30] <djQuery> geoous, this is probably the most popular one https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
[11:50:58] <_|Nix|_> gates_: What's up?
[11:51:08] <gates_> _|Nix|_: any experince with GA and jQM?
[11:51:18] <djQuery> geoous, course the only one that doesn't support placeholder is ie http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-placeholder
[11:51:35] <gates_> I ended up writing a JS that got location.hash and location.pathname and pushed pathname if hash wasn't there
[11:51:43] <gates_> I noticed using the debugger that it was alway reporting hte last page not the next page
[11:51:56] <_|Nix|_> gates_: GA?
[11:52:01] <djQuery> `bbq
[11:52:02] <gates_> Google Analytics*
[11:52:06] <sunbeam> anyone in here common with google maps API?
[11:52:13] <_|Nix|_> gates_: No idea. Sorry!
[11:52:21] <gates_> fair enough
[11:52:25] <aMoniker> sunbeam: I've used it a little, quite some time ago
[11:52:29] <gates_> _|Nix|_: jQM is an beast in itself it seems
[11:52:37] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/4uzkU3Ex
[11:52:43] <sunbeam> does anyone see what goes wrong here??
[11:52:43] <djQuery> gates_, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[11:52:57] <_|Nix|_> gates_: I work on jQM, but I don't do much in the way of trying to use it for things :)
[11:53:05] <sunbeam> no errors, nothing
[11:53:08] <sunbeam> address is correct
[11:53:54] <gates_> djQuery: please explain
[11:54:15] <djQuery> gates_, a hash plugin
[11:54:16] <gates_> _|Nix|_: i hear u, i just did a huge job on it for a big name company, I'd love to get infront of devs and see if i could help
[11:54:37] <gates_> djQuery: how would that help reporting?
[11:54:48] <gates_> what error am i missing in HTML5 browsers?
[11:54:54] <djQuery> <gates_> I ended up writing a JS that got location.hash and location.pathname
[11:54:55] <sunbeam> how come google changes the .geometry[] array so often?
[11:54:58] <sunbeam> the array value nam es
[11:55:07] <sunbeam> nvm i fixed it
[11:55:10] <_|Nix|_> gates_: We can always use the help ...
[11:55:18] <djQuery> gates_, there is always this http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[11:55:27] <gates_> http://makeawe.so/text/1K3g390e313q
[11:56:07] <gates_> _|Nix|_: i'd love to, you guys saved me a lot of time (and maybe a lot of headaches) but maybe i can help with a different practical feedback
[11:56:26] <gates_> I can PM you the app if youd like
[11:56:57] <gates_> its a Facebook App (cavas) as well as a mobile app that login with facebook and works on desktop (RWD)
[11:57:21] <djQuery> gates_, did you have any luck binding to pageshow on the initial page ?
[11:57:37] <gates_> that code i just pasted seem sto be working but i only have it on the dev site
[11:57:53] <gates_> but using the GA debugger i see it reporting correctly
[11:59:00] <dnyy> when serializing a form, is there a way to ignore any inputs within a hidden container?
[11:59:20] <djQuery> gates_, you do know that  src="//google-analytics.com/ga.js" is a perfectly valid url right?
[11:59:29] <gates_> I do
[11:59:32] <gates_> but thats what GA gives me
[11:59:35] <djQuery> gates_, the browser will add the http or https for you
[11:59:36] <gates_> so why change it?
[11:59:39] <djQuery> ah
[12:00:10] <gates_> heres the code from google - http://makeawe.so/text/3k0m0u2c032r
[12:00:25] <gates_> that what they give you to track pages in analytics
[12:01:14] <djQuery> wonder y they use a different subdomain for http vs https?
[12:01:27] <gates_> prob just a fallback
[12:01:55] <gates_> i wondering the same as i've beeing using src="//..." in other places
[12:02:12] <djQuery> https://google-analytics.com/ga.js   and http://google-analytics.com/ga.js  both work
[12:02:17] <djQuery> just test them
[12:02:27] <gates_> yes they do
[12:03:02] <djQuery> sorry ment to say I just tested them
[12:03:38] <djQuery> gates_, did you have any luck binding to pageshow on the initial page ?
[12:04:01] <gates_> i see it firing on ini page
[12:04:45] <gates_> sorry, im not fully understanding- I think I'm feeling noob
[12:04:53] <gates_> _|Nix|_: can i PM you
[12:05:17] <edoc> hi , we have raek?
[12:05:26] <djQuery> gates I am binding to a #main page load checking to see if a variable is set and it doesn't always trigger
[12:05:53] <gates_> single or multi
[12:06:07] <djQuery> changpage to a setting page  where I also have a showpage binding
[12:06:10] <djQuery> multi
[12:06:15] <edoc> last day i ask him  to opinion   about a snapshot home system for alert  when an unknows  hit the sensor
[12:06:24] <djQuery> single doc
[12:06:26] <gates_> I had an issue and resolved it but I think i just ran teh code twice :'
[12:06:34] <gates_> or i used , hold on
[12:07:06] <djQuery> gates_, its messy today is code clean up day   http://jsbin.com/tipper/29/edit
[12:07:07] <edoc> hi djquery
[12:07:08] <gates_> $(document).on('pageshow', function(){ } should fire both
[12:07:21] <gates_> $(document).on('pageshow', function(){ console.log('fired!'); });
[12:07:55] <gates_> dont use $(document).ready(function() { });
[12:08:05] <gates_> unless youre using it for a reason
[12:08:19] <djQuery> $('#main').on('pagebeforeshow pageshow', function(){
[12:08:42] <gates_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7422253/jquery-mobile-document-ready-not-firing
[12:08:58] <djQuery> gates_, it firing fine
[12:09:10] <djQuery> gates_, but I will read the link
[12:09:13] <gates_> live is deprecated :x
[12:09:31] <gates_> i should fix that on my code
[12:09:37] <djQuery> gates_, I am not using .live anywhere
[12:09:45] <gates_> i am :x
[12:09:54] <mc_plectrum> how can i disable contextmenu, without disabling right click?
[12:09:59] <djQuery> gates_, or you could just write a helper function that calls live
[12:10:04] <djQuery> calls on rather
[12:10:10] <gates_> ready() wont fire on ajax page changes, you know this?
[12:10:26] <djQuery> gates_, there are no ajax pages
[12:10:35] <gates_> ahh
[12:10:51] <Jester86> gates, bill gates
[12:10:51] <djQuery> gates_, once I get all the bugs worked out will throw it into phone gap
[12:10:57] <gates_> i never really used multi pages but from what i saw it was the same
[12:11:04] <mc_plectrum> .bind("contextmenu", function(e) { return false;});  also disables click() to fire
[12:11:12] <gates_> Jester86, jester
[12:11:26] <djQuery> mc_plectrum, err no it doesn't
[12:11:29] <gates_> JΞSTΞR
[12:12:20] <Assimilater> Hi all, I've been away from programming for a while but got back into it recently and am having the darndest time wrapping my head around this bug, I figure it must be something silly. http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/5rypB/2/ notice that by clicking on Name and Discharge on the left it creates divs on the right. Pushing the clear Form button clears the form. There are individual remove buttons i'm working on right now. They work great except when there's e
[12:12:21] <mc_plectrum> djQuery: it does fire only on left click afterwards.. commenting the .bind(... and click() works on right click as well
[12:12:54] <gates_> know what the best way to code is? have a hookah youre smoking.
[12:13:35] <shadyKhan> i have an element that i want to show when hovered on a list but how can i make the element stay shown when i move from the list to the now shown element?
[12:15:42] <djQuery> mc_plectrum, http://jsfiddle.net/HRgxZ/
[12:16:05] <Selenaa> I need really help with modal window to function like Pinterest one.. anyone please if you made it before
[12:16:13] <Selenaa> Let me know how i can do it, thank you
[12:16:31] <djQuery> Selenaa, did you ever get the link to modal to work?
[12:16:36] <gates_> shadyKhan: u can set a toggle
[12:17:10] <mc_plectrum> djQuery:  thx, but it does work only on left click using chrome/firefox
[12:17:35] <djQuery> mc_plectrum, sorry ain't got ie to test
[12:18:21] <mc_plectrum> djQuery:  nor am i
[12:18:37] <djQuery> mc_plectrum, have 1 function that does both then detect which was done and retrun false
[12:18:58] <Selenaa> djQuery it worked before too, i can open the Modal Window when i click on the link but from there i have problems, i don't know how i can reproduce same effect as pinterest does. That being said.. what i need to do is freeze the body so it doesn't scroll anymore and have only the modal box scroll up down incase its bigger then the screen
[12:19:22] <djQuery> mc_plectrum, http://jsfiddle.net/HRgxZ/1/
[12:19:47] <mc_plectrum> djQuery: that did the trick!! thx :-)
[12:20:20] <Jester86> Is there any way to do .has(...) for soemthing like has more than 1 of these?
[12:20:41] <Jester86> Ie I want to get a select that has at least 2 options with a value = ''
[12:21:38] <djQuery> Jester86, its slow but you could do  .filter(function(){ return ( $(this).find('.whatever').length>2 ); });
[12:21:40] <Jester86> Currently I am using $('select').has("option[value='']").each(.. and checking each select's children
[12:21:50] <Jester86> ahh
[12:21:59] <Jester86> that may be better than my current approach
[12:22:20] <Jester86> ATM I just have a series of nested .each functions
[12:23:03] <djQuery> Jester86, also your .has has an issue   <option name="have no value">HAHA</option>
[12:23:39] <Jester86> djQuery these options have a value.. sharepoint :-\
[12:24:10] <djQuery> Jester86, ok was just mentioning in case,    And I feel for you having to do sharepoint
[12:24:14] <bluesm> can I call in context the function in "data" ?
[12:24:23] <bluesm> That I've set in data of DOM element ?
[12:24:23] <djQuery> Jester86, you have my condolences
[12:24:35] <_|Nix|_> gates_: Sure. PM away.
[12:24:37] <Jester86> djQuery thanks.. lol   I will admit - it does pay the bills.
[12:25:02] <djQuery> Jester86, get any extra send it my way
[12:25:16] <Jester86> I personally only use linux software at home but.. I'm willing to work for the dark side in exchange for money
[12:25:32] <djQuery> Jester86, sharepoint is the reason my home machine had to have 32 gigs of ram
[12:25:39] <Jester86> djQuery as soon as I get my student debt paid off..  only another decade or so.
[12:26:13] <djQuery> Jester86, the dark side is what vms are good for
[12:26:32] <Assimilater> Hi all, I am having the darndest time wrapping my head around this bug, I figure it must be something silly. http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/5rypB/2/ notice that by clicking on Name and Discharge on the left it creates divs on the right. Pushing the clear Form button clears the form. There are individual remove buttons i'm working on right now. They work great except when there's exactly two parameters if you click on the remove button in the first one the
[12:26:40] <eddiemonge> bluesm: what do you mean?
[12:27:20] <Jester86> djQuery that would be true if our VS2010 vm was built correctly.  The POS will only run on a couple versions of VMware Player and only the windows versions at that..
[12:27:29] <bluesm> eddiemonge: That if you call $actualStep.data("validate")()
[12:27:49] <Jester86> djQuery.. I had to write this to remove extra blank options sharepoint is adding.. for no fucking reason.  http://jsfiddle.net/bkc2T/
[12:27:51] <bluesm> eddiemonge: You'll get context of window..
[12:28:08] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: what is varType, argument and unit? what doctype is this for? why not use data-attr?
[12:28:50] <eddiemonge> bluesm: whats the trailing () for? you mean you want to call some function that is global from a name that is stored in data?
[12:29:07] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: I omitted other portions of the web page for simplicity. varType will be used to indicated whether the search is comparing strings or numbers (it's irrelevant at this point)
[12:29:22] <Jester86> djQuery.. if you have a second could you show me how I could do that using .filter.  I'm still trying to learn jquery :-\
[12:29:26] <eddiemonge> i was just curious why you were using nonstandard things
[12:29:39] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: it's more for the ajax script I'll be running than anything (varType)
[12:29:45] <djQuery> Jester86, couldn't you just do   $('select option[value=""]:not(:selected)').remove();
[12:29:50] <bluesm> eddiemonge: nope
[12:30:10] <bluesm> eddiemonge: I assigned appropriate functions to DOM elements. And I want them to be called with context...
[12:30:24] <Jester86> djQuery I only want to remove the non-selected blank options from selects that have more than one blank option.
[12:30:38] <eddiemonge> bluesm: what do you mean with context?
[12:30:55] <bluesm> eddiemonge: That "this" keyword will point to the dom elment
[12:30:57] <Selenaa> Anyone worked before with modal windows? that are similar to pinterest?
[12:31:21] <eddiemonge> bluesm: what do you want to do with it? are you talking about using it in an event handler?
[12:31:54] <djQuery> Jester86, AHHHHH I imagine that a lot of times they have one where the first one is <option value="">Select an option</option>
[12:32:18] <djQuery> wouldnt want to get rid of that one
[12:32:39] <bluesm> eddiemonge: Noo. I just assigned the validate functions to the "Divs"
[12:32:47] <bluesm> https://gist.github.com/bluesm/5239921
[12:32:50] <bluesm> eddiemonge: ^
[12:32:52] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: whats the issue? im not really seeing a problem, i think
[12:33:13] <bluesm> eddiemonge: And then I want to call one of them with "context"...
[12:33:31] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: so if you click on "name" twice it adds two parameters. Now click the 'x' box for removing it on the first of the two, both disappear
[12:33:37] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: instead of just the one
[12:33:44] <bluesm> eddiemonge: like $stepCollection.eq(1).data("validate")();
[12:33:49] <Jester86> qjQuery, exactly. just without that text()/html().. its jsut blank.  But then in the edit form you cannot set the field back to a blank value unless you make a blank option.. in which case you end up with 2 blank options in your new form's dropdown.
[12:34:23] <Jester86> really dumb but.. that's sharepoint =)
[12:35:15] <Jester86> I do have to admit though.. it would cost the client far more money to build everything sharepoint has from scratch.. the trade off is that if they don't like some of its functionality we then have to dev around it.
[12:35:57] <djQuery> bluesm,  var $self = $(this);   errr var $self = $(el);
[12:36:07] <djQuery> bluesm, gues either way works
[12:36:34] <stemid> anyone here with experience with the waypoints plugin? I've seen behavior where an offset of bottom-in-view for a scroll to load feature works perfectly in safari, chrome, opera, msie9 but in ff19 and ff20 I get intermittent issues of the waypoint not firing, or hanging and refusing to fire at random points. is this a known issue?
[12:36:47] <bluesm>  djQuery:  But not withing "each".
[12:36:53] <bluesm>  djQuery:  Outside each :)
[12:37:02] <djQuery> Assimilater, get it fingered?
[12:37:42] <djQuery> bluesm,  the way you are doing your each   el===this
[12:37:54] <Assimilater> djQuery: fingered? does that mean figured out? no
[12:38:02] <djQuery> each(function(index, elm)
[12:38:03] <bluesm> djQuery: https://gist.github.com/bluesm/5239966
[12:39:12] <djQuery> bluesm, it doesn't realy matter they are the same thing https://gist.github.com/djQuery/5239971
[12:39:43] <bluesm> djQuery:ok. But this is not my problem :)
[12:39:54] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: not sure. the codes a bit complicated
[12:40:00] <bluesm> djQuery: The problem is of bad "context" of last call...
[12:41:05] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: thanks for looking at it
[12:42:44] <djQuery> Assimilater, first lets start by trying to clean up the code a little $('#Clear').click(wipe);
[12:43:38] <Jester86> djQuery.. check this thing out. http://jsfiddle.net/bkc2T/1/
[12:44:00] <Jester86> Probably fairly basic to anyone with experience but I'm liking it.. lol
[12:44:19] <Jester86> .filter is a lot cleaner than using IFs and EACHs
[12:44:42] <djQuery> jester pretty good
[12:45:02] <fission6> can you modify a css style with jquery, like something defined in style.css and set it to another value
[12:45:09] <djQuery> Jester86, filter is probably just as slow as .each but still it looks easier to read
[12:45:29] <Jester86> yes fission6   .css('display','block')
[12:45:41] <Assimilater> djQuery: k, http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/5rypB/4/
[12:46:05] <fission6> not what i meant, hard to explain
[12:46:30] <Jester86> djQuery yeah.. I'd hope its about the most optimized way to go about it so using that over your own IFs and EACHs which may not be as optimized
[12:46:50] <Jester86> fission6 try me..
[12:47:23] <fission6> i meant can i create or override a css style
[12:47:25] <Jester86> fission6 are you talking about literally modifying what is writen in the .css file?
[12:47:29] <fission6> i don't think its the right soution anwyas
[12:48:09] <slackz> I've been Googling all morning, and I cannot find an updated / current XSLT plugin for jQuery. Anyone know of one?
[12:48:09] <Jester86> fission6 you can overwrite css with jquery.. you just have to select it properly
[12:48:55] <djQuery> Jester86, dunno if this will work $('select').children('[value=""]').siblings('[value=""]').not(':selected').remove();
[12:49:09] <Jester86> Ie,  .myClass{ color:blue; } in css would be overwritten via jQ like this:  $('.myClass').css('color','red');
[12:50:14] <dcherman> Jester86: sure, but what state does color: "red" represent?  it's pretty useful to tie your representation to what state your widget or element is in
[12:50:40] <dcherman> maybe its "invalid-input" or something.  gives a lot more information that just color:red
[12:50:50] <djQuery> fission6, there is also $('.myClass').css({color: 'blue', display: 'block'}); if you need to set multiples
[12:51:01] <Jester86> ooh djQuery.. I like that idea.. Though I'll go one further.      $("select option[value='']").siblings("option[value='']").not(':selected').remove();
[12:51:22] <djQuery> Jester86, that may actualy be slower
[12:51:27] <Jester86> wait that won't work
[12:51:29] <Jester86> lol
[12:51:47] <Jester86> say you have 2 blank options in the same select and neither of them are selected.
[12:52:28] <Jester86> it'll remove both of them... unless it breaks the execution of the second when its removed.
[12:53:36] <djQuery> Jester86, option groups breaks both I think
[12:53:41] <Jester86> dcherman you are correct.. and that is something I need to do more often
[12:54:24] <Jester86> alright djQuery.. but why is it slower to do $('select > option') vs $('select').children('option')?  Like I said I'm still trying to learn.
[12:55:40] <djQuery> Jester86, the [name="whatver"] is what is slow
[12:56:01] <djQuery> Jester86, so if you can narrow down what gets to it it will be faster
[12:56:06] <Jester86> djQuery but you were doing that in the .children() also.
[12:56:54] <djQuery> Jester86, if I remember correctly the sizzle selector engine that jquery uses actual work right to left not left to right
[12:57:02] <Jester86> $("select > option[value='']") vs $('select').children("option[value='']")
[12:57:31] <djQuery> so using the first there ^^^^
[12:58:00] <Jester86> djQuery so it'd be looking for all options with value of '' then filter those who have a parent of 'select'?
[12:58:09] <djQuery> find every thing that has value=""   then check to see if it is an option then check to see if its parent is a select
[12:58:15] <Jester86> ahh
[12:58:43] <djQuery> no it would be cycling through every single element on the page and seeing if it is has a value
[12:58:46] <dcherman> djQuery: not quite - it would check all option elements to see if they have value=''
[12:58:47] <djQuery> very slow
[12:58:53] <Jester86> interesting.. though I'd still like to know for sure if that is how it works if you are unsure.
[12:59:26] <Jester86> If you are sure then I'll believe you
[12:59:35] <djQuery> I am not sure
[13:00:16] <Jester86> I googled it a while back and about every time it was asked on stackoverflow people said there was no difference.. but other than that I have no clue.
[13:00:26] <djQuery> that info was quite a while ago and both browsers and jquery\sizzle have progressed
[13:00:59] <djQuery> Jester86, its easy enough to create a jsperf yourself and finger it out
[13:01:07] <dcherman> Jester86: we're talking micro-optimization here, it really won't make a difference.  but for your knowledge, the $( "select" ) one MIGHT be more optimized because it'll initially use getElementsByTagName and then a context based querySelectorAll
[13:01:16] <Jester86> True.. idk I'll have to look into it some time.  I'd like to be doing things as optimized as possible just for the sake of setting good habits.
[13:01:18] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/
[13:01:26] <dcherman> but quite honestly, it's not an optimization to really worry about.  write what's clear
[13:01:38] <dcherman> profile later if needed
[13:03:47] <Assimilater> djQuery:  figured it out, when you add a new parameter it was adding handlers to already existing parameters, inserting the line '$('#setArgs *').off()' to the first line under the click function for li makes it work
[13:04:57] <Jester86> hey sorry I'm back.. mifi died
[13:05:06] <lasha> Anyone know of good Dropkick.js alternatives?
[13:05:12] <lasha> Since it doesn't support the latest jQuery?
[13:05:36] <Jester86> I swear that mifi thing is a piece of crap.  Pretty sure it dies anytime someone microwaves a bag of popcorn.
[13:06:01] <djQuery> Selenaa, set the overflow of the page to not allow scroll
[13:06:26] <djQuery> set the overflow of the overlay to scroll
[13:09:30] <eddiemonge> lasha: like jqueryui?
[13:09:57] <eddiemonge> lasha: why doesnt it support the latest jquery?
[13:10:41] <lasha> eddiemonge: because it uses jquery methods that are removed from the latest jquery, like $.browser
[13:10:52] <lasha> eddiemonge: just used the migrate plugin, but that's wrong...
[13:11:01] <eddiemonge> wrong how?
[13:11:23] <djQuery> eddiemonge, if ($.browser.msie && $.browser.version.substr(0, 1) < 7)
[13:11:39] <djQuery> https://github.com/JamieLottering/DropKick/blob/master/jquery.dropkick-1.0.0.js
[13:12:12] <eddiemonge> looks like the ie6 part can be dropped
[13:12:45] <eddiemonge> although the project looks abandoned anyway
[13:13:10] <djQuery> basicaly they don't seem to be doing anything if it is ie6
[13:13:15] <Selenaa> Hello everyone... anyone good with Window Modals? i am trying to reproduce something similar to Pinterest but i'm out of luck
[13:13:25] <Selenaa> Please, if anyone can help i would really appreciate it
[13:13:52] <wroathe> Selenaa: Use jQuery UI
[13:14:14] <wroathe> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[13:14:17] <djQuery> eddiemonge, aren't they breaking everything else out there document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className + ' dk_fouc';
[13:14:20] <Selenaa> wroathe, and how will i be doing it to be like pinterest?
[13:14:26] <eddiemonge> interviews are tiring
[13:14:36] <wroathe> Selenaa: I don't use pinterest
[13:14:49] <djQuery> Selenaa, http://stackoverflow.com/a/9280412/295800
[13:14:53] <eddiemonge> djQuery: no. its appending a class to the document
[13:14:54] <wroathe> Selenaa: You asked how to set up a modal window, I told you a pretty idiomatic way of doing it
[13:15:21] <Selenaa> wroathe, i know but problem is i need it like pinterest and Jquery ui won't solve that;p
[13:15:44] <djQuery> eddiemonge, then why not just do $(document).addClass('dk');
[13:15:53] <djQuery> wouldn't that work on both
[13:15:55] <Selenaa> djQuery, i tired already that but it doesn't work properly... i need to write custom jquery code maybe to make it work properly
[13:16:04] <eddiemonge> djQuery: performance?
[13:16:05] <Selenaa> djQuery, and i am not good enough to achieve it seems so..
[13:16:18] <eddiemonge> Selenaa: what doesnt work on it?
[13:16:25] <Jester86> what is the regular javascript equivalent of .remove()?
[13:16:40] <eddiemonge> Jester86: removeChild?
[13:16:52] <Jester86> perhaps
[13:17:17] <djQuery> Jester86, http://stackoverflow.com/a/3391282/295800
[13:17:45] <djQuery> Jester86, but basicaly elem=document.getElementById(id)).parentNode.removeChild(elem);
[13:17:57] <Jester86> ah yes
[13:18:01] <Jester86> thanks guys
[13:18:01] <Selenaa> eddiemonge, Its complicated i try to make a modal box to have its own "screen" and be able to scroll while the body ( the site, bg and etc) to stay still
[13:18:14] <Selenaa> eddiemonge, check this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9280258/prevent-body-scrolling-but-allow-overlay-scrolling/9280412#9280412
[13:18:24] <Selenaa> exactly what this guy try to get i try too
[13:21:13] <veQue> just curious, that dotted square that you get in a browser(ff), can jquery touch that?
[13:22:43] <eddiemonge> Selenaa: http://jsfiddle.net/S2wML/
[13:22:56] <eddiemonge> veQue: you mean css outline?
[13:23:03] <veQue> possibly
[13:23:45] <veQue> basically i was going to make a greasemonkey script to make a bolder highlight
[13:24:19] <Selenaa> eddiemonge, i know how to do that, but that's not how i need it :( you see the scrollbar should be on the right of the screen on the whole screen not only in modal box
[13:24:21] <Selenaa> if you get it
[13:24:21] <veQue> because i use tab, and there's a website that doesnt outline elements too good
[13:25:56] <veQue> eddiemonge:  k thanks btw i think that is it
[13:27:24] <eddiemonge> any designers want to trade a bit of work?
[13:29:01] <djQuery> eddiemonge, what did you use for your loriem epson generation there
[13:29:21] <eddiemonge> say what?
[13:29:36] <djQuery> eddiemonge, Donec aliquet leo vel magna. Phasellus rhoncus faucibus ante. Etiam bibendum, enim faucibus aliquet rhoncus, arcu felis ultricies
[13:29:36] <veQue> eddiemonge: nope don't think that's what i'm looking for afterall
[13:29:44] <eddiemonge> djQuery: where is that?
[13:29:57] <djQuery> nm
[13:30:11] <eddiemonge> veQue: got an example then?
[13:30:30] <Selenaa> :(
[13:31:54] <veQue> well ok goto imgur.com in ff, hold tab and you'll begin highlighting elements, but when you eventually get to the pic links the dotted highlight is no longer visable
[13:34:36] <eddiemonge> veQue: thats a bit complicated but its outline and border i think
[13:34:44] <eddiemonge> also i think they might have changed tab order but im not sure
[13:35:03] <veQue> no the tab order is fine
[13:35:22] <veQue> but hold on i got a screencap
[13:36:56] <veQue> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=47882 can you tell which one of these links is highlighted?
[13:37:28] <veQue> i can but it's not easy
[13:38:03] <veQue> upper blue dot gives it away
[13:38:25] <veQue> so you don't think i can access that?
[13:38:55] <eddiemonge> veQue: you could make your thing that highlights it on focus/active
[13:39:45] <veQue> ok, i'll give it a try
[13:40:05] <codezombie> nvm, just found the pull request
[13:40:22] <codezombie> any recommendations on something like this for linux? I've found a standalone, but it's windows only.
[13:41:35] <eddiemonge> codezombie: say what?
[13:42:45] <codezombie> eddiemonge: I was looking for something to populate my auction houses in my 3.3.5a server. I saw you guys had something in the works, but then found the pull request that hadn't been merged yet.
[13:43:02] <codezombie> running in linux
[13:43:09] <codezombie> damn
[13:43:11] <codezombie> wrong channel
[13:43:12] <codezombie> wtf
[13:43:17] * codezombie bashes linkinus
[13:43:25] <codezombie> move along... nothing to see here.
[13:43:28] <eddiemonge> lol
[13:43:28] <codezombie> :)
[13:44:36] <veQue> i bet there are a few zombies in the walking dead still at their computers
[13:44:56] <codezombie> veQue
[13:45:04] <codezombie> veQue: I think that's the entirety of reddit.
[13:47:51] <anli_> Seems like maskMoney in a dialog gives a text input that is not editable, is that it?
[13:51:45] <bluesm>  /join #english
[13:52:19] <pachet> Join to channel #english synced after 58 seconds
[13:57:19] <bluesm> pachet: What it was ?
[13:57:35] <bluesm>  pachet:  Join to channel #english synced after 58 seconds  ?
[14:09:55] <anli_> Actually, I dont get maskMoney to work in a non-dialog input either
[14:10:23] <anli_> Does it rely on other plugins?
[14:12:38] <eddiemonge> seems excessively large
[14:12:53] <eddiemonge> and not compat with 1.9
[14:13:27] <anli_> Is there a jquery input mask plugin bundled with jquery ui?
[14:14:39] <Mr_Grim> hey? why would: $("#personalDetails :input[text]").attr("disabled","disabled"); disable a <button></button> tag?
[14:15:42] <djQuery> Mr_Grim, <input type="button">
[14:16:23] <djQuery> Mr_Grim, did you mean to do :input[type='text']
[14:16:37] <bluesm> should I convert one elements collection to "one jquery object" ?
[14:16:40] <eddiemonge> and prop('disabled', 'disabled')?
[14:16:42] <djQuery> Mr_Grim, if so drop the :input and just use input
[14:18:34] <eddiemonge> bluesm?
[14:19:53] <anli_> Trying $('#foo').mask({ mask: "9*:99" }); to have an input that allows an amount like 34:50, however, cant use an amount bigger than 99
[14:20:01] <anli_> Is there a better input mask plugin?
[14:20:28] <anli_> I also want it to react on pressing :
[14:20:37] <djQuery> Selenaa, did you ever right click and viewsource on pintrest?
[14:20:37] <Mr_Grim> i just tried that
[14:20:43] <Mr_Grim> what is the : for?
[14:20:54] <anli_> The divider between integer and fraction
[14:21:00] <djQuery> the overlay is wrapped in a zoomScroll
[14:21:07] <Mr_Grim> $("input[type=text]").addClass("input_disabled"); isnt working
[14:21:19] <anli_> foo.add('disabled', 'disabled');
[14:21:21] <anli_> oops
[14:21:25] <anli_> foo.attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[14:21:27] <anli_> nothing else
[14:21:45] <anli_> To enable, then foo.removeAttr('disabled');
[14:22:12] <djQuery> anli_, .prop('disabeled', true);   .prop('disabled', false);
[14:22:22] <anli_> I never use .prop
[14:22:32] <anli_> I find the concept of attribute the less confusing
[14:23:43] <systemfault> ...
[14:23:54] <anli_> It would be great if jquery just added .enable() and .disable()
[14:24:16] <anli_> I also love writing three dots
[14:24:18] <anli_> :)
[14:26:18] <dcherman> anli_: $.fn.enable = function() { return this.prop( "enabled", true ); };         there you go.
[14:26:28] <anli_> I know I can do that, you misunderstood me
[14:26:42] <bluesm> eddiemonge: ?
[14:26:52] <bluesm> eddiemonge: You can have collection with one element
[14:27:02] <bluesm> eddiemonge: or one jquery object.
[14:27:05] <eddiemonge> yes
[14:27:18] <eddiemonge> i like to avoid attr when its a property
[14:27:19] <systemfault> In practice, you should prefer properties to attributes… because it's the 'real' DOM interface
[14:27:32] <systemfault> eddiemonge: Good :)
[14:28:10] <anli_> I thought html had attributes, so what is a property then?
[14:28:23] <eddiemonge> it has both
[14:29:40] <djQuery> anli_, attributes are something that you do an   <div attribute="somethig"   thisisjustaprop
[14:30:12] <djQuery> anli_, props are stuf that you don't have to set to anything just having them in there are all sets thim
[14:30:20] <systemfault> anli_: Any html tag is represented by a Node element. That Node has properties (functions and variables) and an array of attributes that are what was written in the HTML at the time of parsing
[14:30:29] <eddiemonge> an attribute can be thought of as static like src or href where property is something that is dynamic like enabled or selected
[14:30:33] <djQuery> <input atrribute="something"   disabled />
[14:31:49] <anli_> Oh, I thought props just where attributes, like disabled automatically (under the hood) was translated to disabled='disabled'
[14:33:43] <anli_> Someone even claimed that disabled='disabled' is the correct way to write
[14:34:03] <systemfault> Well, don't mix things up
[14:34:16] <anli_> And what did I mix with what?
[14:34:24] <systemfault> disabled="disabled" is the XHTML way to declare that a field is disabled
[14:34:29] <anli_> Ah, ok
[14:34:57] <systemfault> <input disabled="disabled" /> is XHTML, <input disabled> is HTML
[14:35:11] <systemfault> In both cases, they're attributes.
[14:35:11] <anli_> Thanks for clearing up
[14:35:21] <anli_> yes, but maybe I will go for .prop then
[14:35:30] <systemfault> .prop is always preferable
[14:35:36] <anli_> But I also think that foo.attr('disabled', true'); works, right?
[14:35:42] <systemfault> Sure
[14:35:45] <anli_> Wonder why then
[14:35:52] <anli_> Does not make a lot of sense
[14:36:05] <systemfault> It's mainly because of XHTML...
[14:36:19] <systemfault> disabled is an attribute that doesn't have a value
[14:36:26] <anli_> But noone would write <input type="text" disabled="true"/>
[14:37:01] <systemfault> But in XML, an attribute MUST HAVE a value (So using XHTML, you need to have a value)
[14:37:02] <anli_> I thouht it was an attribute thats false when it had the value null
[14:37:12] <anli_> yes
[14:37:25] <jChris1> Hi all. got a question: consulted the documentation, but can't figure it out. looking to clone a select from a hidden form with a user script. using this code: http://jsbin.com/ofihuj/1/edit and options aren't populating. Is it inheriting its Hidden property with the deep copy? (sorry if this is a double; got disconnected)
[14:37:29] <systemfault> anli_: The value for disabled="disabled" is meaningles
[14:37:36] <systemfault> meaningless..
[14:37:39] <anli_> ok
[14:37:49] <systemfault> anli_: disabled="ROFLOLOLOLL" would still disable the input
[14:37:52] <anli_> And disabled is not a sloppy way of writing then
[14:37:56] <anli_> yes
[14:38:03] <anli_> disabled="trololo"
[14:38:27] <systemfault> Because in the end, only the attribute name matters… the value only needs to exist for a XHTML document to be valid.
[14:38:27] <anli_> disabled="notatall" would also disable
[14:38:33] <anli_> got it
[14:41:22] <tebrown> Hello
[14:41:51] <jChris1> 'ello
[14:42:09] <tebrown> I;ve got this problem in regards to my jsfiddle document.
[14:42:31] <tebrown> http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/10/
[14:42:49] <tebrown> You may think its a css problem but it's something to do with the jquery.
[14:43:00] <tebrown> Its not fully showing the borders on each image.
[14:43:32] <jChris1> why wouldn't it be a css problem?
[14:44:27] <tebrown> If you remove the last function in the javascript area, it removes the problem.
[14:44:39] <jChris1> cool. good place to start.
[14:45:55] <tebrown> But now im stumped on what it could be?
[14:46:21] <jChris1> sorry, jsfiddle's bugging out on me
[14:46:28] <jChris1> got a jsbin url?
[14:47:16] <tebrown> il make one
[14:47:18] <jChris1> nvm, got it to work in another browser.
[14:47:35] <tebrown> ok sweet
[14:47:38] <tebrown> thanks
[14:47:46] <rakl> IE8 doesn't support indexOf?
[14:52:05] <Selenaa> Anyone can help me with MODAL WINDOW... i try to make something similar to pinterest but no luck in it:(
[14:55:10] <tebrown> Any luck jChris1?
[14:55:17] <grafi> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/UJjF7/  when you click on the left image its working fine, when you click on the right image (after the page has loaded!) the text slides down then up and down again ... anybody got a clue why that is and how to fix it?
[14:56:50] <jChris1> sorry, tebrown, I'm a bit stumped. No experience with jqueryUI
[14:58:08] <tebrown> jChris1 what would be another way to have text below the image for each image
[14:58:18] <tebrown> without sing jquery
[14:58:21] <tebrown> using
[14:59:36] <jChris1> gotta run, tebrown. Wish I had more time to help. Hopefully someone else will pick up on it. Best of luck to you.
[14:59:50] <tebrown> Thanks for your time
[15:04:05] <Foxhoundz> Odd question
[15:04:23] <Foxhoundz> Actually
[15:04:25] <Foxhoundz> I'll just google it
[15:04:59] <Foxhoundz> ..and found it!
[15:05:36] <anli_> Is .prop new to jquery?

[15:09:09] <rainabba> Afternoon folks. Back for more knowledge. I'm looking for an "easy" way to reliabily remove an item in an array by a property/value pair. $.grep() will give me the object, but not an index. Since I don't know the index, I can't use splice yet. I can't use $.inArray() because I'm dealing with an object (only works for simple arrays from what I can see). Is there really not more simple tools for
[15:09:09] <rainabba> array management in jQuery and/or JS? I can see how to use various types of loops but that seems like 1 step too many for such a common operation and all the home-grown solutions have browser-specific issues (like supporting <= IE8.
[15:10:12] <pachet> uh, what's the use case exactly? :[
[15:10:16] <rainabba> Simplest option I can find is myArray = $.grep(myArray, function(a) { }); but I don't know if that's thread safe (or if such issues even exist in JS.
[15:10:22] <pachet> actually, let me rephrase that
[15:10:26] <pachet> ?code

[15:12:26] <djQuery> grrrr this works fine on android browser if I use type="text" but not if I use type="number" http://jsbin.com/ezafik/2/edit
[15:12:38] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ezafik/2/edit
[15:13:42] <anli_> Is :text back btw?
[15:13:47] <anli_> Must check
[15:14:39] <anli_> Ah, it is
[15:19:08] <djQuery> with type="text" you get a go button, with type="number" you get a next button
[15:19:35] <djQuery> evidently the next button only works if there is another input to recieve focus

[15:43:43] <TheEternalAbyss> hello, I have a query issue.. http://www.ideatreesolutions.com/dev/ITSv3/scripts/lightbox/ <-- how do I prevent the gallery from disappearing once an image is clicked??
[15:44:03] <TheEternalAbyss> my overlay disappears when lightbox gets triggered
[15:45:41] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm frankly at a loss and i'm a bit nebbish when it comes to jquery
[15:46:32] <coldhead> nebbish is a great word
[15:46:45] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[15:46:54] <TheEternalAbyss> i meant nebbish, but nebbish works
[15:46:58] <TheEternalAbyss> argh
[15:47:13] <TheEternalAbyss> i mean noobish.. stupid thing is autocorrecting me
[15:47:35] <coldhead> it's autocorrecting you to yiddish
[15:47:42] <coldhead> that's quite impressive
[15:48:06] <TheEternalAbyss> apparently
[15:48:20] <coldhead> i don't understand the problem
[15:48:24] <coldhead> i click Click Here
[15:48:26] <coldhead> get the gallery
[15:48:29] <coldhead> click on a thumb
[15:48:31] <coldhead> get full size
[15:48:33] <coldhead> case closed?
[15:48:44] <coldhead> oh right, you want the gallery back
[15:48:49] <TheEternalAbyss> yea
[15:50:28] <TheEternalAbyss> if I just use $('a') instead of an id or class then it stays… but it'll trigger every overlay I have (and the site will have like 20 galleries, so that can't work for me)
[15:51:34] <coldhead> TheEternalAbyss: can't you just get rid of this code $('.popup').on('click', function() {
[15:51:38] <coldhead> that toggles the popup?
[15:51:50] <coldhead> leave it there and open the lightbox popup over the top?
[15:52:31] <Selenaa> Anyone willing to help me with a modal window? to do it like pinterest style?
[15:53:14] <Selenaa> Im struggling for the past 2 days on this, i am really at the edge of it but can't figure totally out how to do it
[15:53:35] <TheEternalAbyss> i guess I can try it
[15:53:50] <Selenaa> Are you familiar with jQuery?
[15:54:00] <Selenaa> because we'll need to work with it a little in order to make it work
[15:54:10] <Selenaa> Have you seen Pinterest before?
[15:54:29] <coldhead> TheEternalAbyss: otherwise maybe you can add a close callback handler to your lightbox code that reshows the gallery when the full size is closed
[15:54:39] <coldhead> search the lightbox docs for close handler or close callback
[15:54:42] <coldhead> it should support it
[15:55:00] <coldhead> but leaving it on screen in the background is more "organic" than toggling it IMHO
[15:55:32] <TheEternalAbyss> yea but I'm not sure how to do that, as mentioned I'm a noob about jquery
[15:58:23] <Selenaa> Anyone can help?
[15:58:40] <Selenaa> With a modal window similar to pinterest
[15:59:11] <coldhead> TheEternalAbyss: have a look at their examples, you should find some code to poach
[15:59:25] <coldhead> if it's already been written it's better for you to reuse that than have someone here write it for you anew
[15:59:35] <coldhead> mostly in the sense that no one is volunteering
[15:59:53] <coldhead> i am currently nailing my scrotum to a coffee table so i'm not really writing code just now
[16:00:17] <anew> coldhead, u called ?
[16:00:38] <TheEternalAbyss> brb
[16:00:41] <coldhead> hahahah sorry babe
[16:00:45] <anew> lol
[16:00:52] <coldhead> i meant to ping spirow agnew
[16:00:57] <coldhead> i guess you get a lot
[16:00:59] <anew> lmao
[16:01:09] <anew> yeah
[16:10:12] <coldhead> love me like a river does
[16:22:41] <coldhead> well everything seems to be under control here, let's take a short break
[16:25:19] <snover> coldhead: diet coke?
[16:26:20] <TheEternalAbyss> well i'm just going to stop dealing with this tonight and pick it up tomorrow
[16:26:41] <brutalhonesty> anyone up for an helping look through logic for a inArray function?
[16:30:52] <coldhead> ?fweep
[16:30:53] <bot-t> coldhead, TOK
[16:31:06] <coldhead> not giving us much to go on brutalhonesty
[16:31:10] <coldhead> nor to whet our appetites
[16:33:15] <brutalhonesty> sorry lol
[16:33:37] <brutalhonesty> uhh was trying to parse through a json object and get a new value within it everytime
[16:34:04] <coldhead> ?p
[16:34:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:34:24] <brutalhonesty> and had to make sure i didn't get the same one more than once, figured it out by putting the already used values into an array and checking it before grabbing a new value with $.inArray()
[16:35:23] <coldhead> that could work
[16:36:16] <coldhead> i am more the kind of person to do var done = {}; and in the loop: if (key in done) return; else done[key] = true;
[16:36:28] <coldhead> but i think i am on a sex offenders registry for that
[16:36:49] <brutalhonesty> lol
[16:37:22] <brutalhonesty> here is the rough copy, the function is in jquery function setup (I'm using $.extend()): http://jsbin.com/uponed/1/
[16:37:46] <brutalhonesty> but it works for me
[16:38:59] <coldhead> brutalhonesty: for this kind of thing i would be more inclined to put all the comments in an array, shuffle it and then pop() elements off
[16:39:07] <coldhead> that way you don't have to track uniqueness
[16:39:36] <brutalhonesty> I see
[16:40:10] <brutalhonesty> i like pop :D
[16:48:08] <anew> hey worry i know i asked this before, where is a list of .on() params i can pass
[16:52:39] <sheilablackrose> Hi guys i'm trying to pass a function into a function. Can someone take a look at this and advice please http://jsfiddle.net/9EUrj/

[17:18:38] <bla> I'm fighting Firefox issue - I guess. But maybe someone knows it - http://julesjanssen.github.com/chosen/ after selecting anything in multiple select (second example) - 'choose a country' disappears. Then I go to 'project page on github (first link)' and then hit BACK. In the window I can see 'Cho' - part of placeholder. Any idea why? :)
[17:18:54] <bla> Happens on firefox exclusively currently.
[17:20:52] <coldhead> you know who knows a lot about browser bugs is our man snover
[17:22:00] <gf3> Feel free to PM snover

[17:40:38] <anew> obv
[17:40:44] <anew> having some trouble with loading times
[17:40:47] <anew> are you using it vladikoff ?
[17:40:56] <vladikoff> anew, only with pushstate
[17:40:57] <lrtim> I've been working on a slider but been having trouble with lopping the images. Here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/16/
[17:41:04] <anew> yeah i'm using it for pushstate also
[17:41:09] <anew> you have clean url's right /shop/shoe
[17:41:14] <spobat> how can I make these fullscreen-dialogs where the entire background gets pale?
[17:41:34] <anew> my question is, when you first go to your site, are you supposed to load every single js file at once ?
[17:41:55] <coldhead> there are no rules!
[17:42:20] <spobat> like here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6559846/ex.PNG
[17:42:49] <anew> !kick
[17:42:51] <anew> lol
[17:42:54] <anew> why was i op
[17:42:55] <anew> lol
[17:43:30] <spobat> guys, concentrate! :D
[17:44:03] <danheberden> step 1: get a really big box
[17:44:31] <spobat> t_t
[17:44:32] <coldhead> wait, i gotta go to the back of the mall for a box
[17:44:33] <coldhead> brb
[17:44:43] <danheberden> step 2: cut a hole... ugh, i mean, set its background to black or white with  an opacity value of like 0.7
[17:44:48] <spobat> walmart
[17:44:59] <danheberden> step 3: profit
[17:45:01] <coldhead> i'm gonna livestream this box fetching on ustream.tv
[17:45:36] <danheberden> ustream istream we all stream for livestream
[17:46:03] <lrtim> How can i loop this imagery for this slider? http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/16/
[17:47:01] <danheberden> either a) use one of the thousand carousel plugins in existence or b) go back to the beginning?
[17:47:17] <vladikoff> spobat, check this http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-message and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L705
[17:48:05] <spobat> okay
[17:49:12] <coldhead> okay and THANK YOU, you mean
[17:49:19] <lrtim> danheberden: i need it to be exactly like the one in my jsfiddle though.
[17:49:48] <coldhead> what about dan's needs tho
[17:51:54] <anew> vladikoff how are you defining your routes? do you have all your routes in one long file ?

[18:25:04] <omani_> how come?
[18:25:12] <omani_> why february?
[18:25:44] <shoky> think computers
[18:25:45] <snover> because that’s what you told it.
[18:26:07] <omani_> ah
[18:26:13] <omani_> they count from 0
[18:26:39] <omani_> think computers was the right hint ;)
[18:26:40] <omani_> thanks.
[18:26:46] <coldhead> javascript months are 0 indexed
[18:26:47] <shoky> ;]
[18:26:53] <coldhead> it's probably the best thing about javascript
[18:26:57] <coldhead> the one thing they got right
[18:27:16] <shoky> i bet it took them a while
[18:28:14] <snover> at least a week
[18:28:15] <coldhead> they probably had a bunch of meetings to decide between making january 0, null, undefined or -1
[18:28:25] <omani_> and now I need to get UTC time
[18:28:29] <omani_> by using getTime()
[18:28:32] <coldhead> eich screaming "I WANT JANUARY TO BE FALSY"
[18:28:38] <omani_> var dates = new Date(2011, 3, 1);
[18:28:48] <omani_> Date {Fri Apr 01 2011 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)}
[18:28:51] <omani_> note GMT.
[18:29:29] <shoky> lol@falsy january
[18:37:15] <myndzi> i have some draggable elements that .. aren't dragging
[18:37:33] <myndzi> they used to work, there are no errors in the (chrome) console, and i can't work out what i did that's making 'em fail
[18:37:50] <myndzi> any suggestions?
[18:39:49] <b1lly1> ya
[18:40:00] <b1lly1> maybe you changed a selector or id
[18:40:08] <myndzi> the dragstart event fires
[18:40:14] <myndzi> and i set the drag data
[18:40:22] <b1lly1> link me
[18:40:29] <myndzi> can't :\
[18:40:45] <myndzi> i have other lis that i can drag fine too, it's weird
[18:41:00] <myndzi> was just thinking maybe there's a common mistake i may have made
[18:41:34] <shoky> there probably is
[18:41:36] <shoky> ;p
[18:41:50] <shoky> doesn't mean we can guess which
[18:42:02] <myndzi> yeah, but you can throw some at me? :|
[18:42:54] <myndzi> http://pastebin.com/kUHVwWNm
[18:42:58] <myndzi> that's the dragstart event definition
[18:43:04] <myndzi> it executes the code properly
[18:43:21] <myndzi> i know the dragData object i'm using isn't the "proper" way to do it, it's a proxy
[18:44:03] <shoky> uh i've no idea what you're doing there
[18:44:18] <myndzi> just trying to allow the browser to let me drag the element around
[18:44:28] <myndzi> you have to bind a couple events and stuff yeah?
[18:44:47] <shoky> k, didnt realize you're talkin about native events
[18:44:50] <myndzi> there's almost no code to screw up :\
[18:45:00] <myndzi> ah, not the jqueryui thing
[18:45:25] <myndzi> i asked in here because i was unsure if jquery's event handling may be part of the trouble
[18:45:32] <myndzi> i'm really stretching by this point :P
[18:46:22] <shoky> no idea
[18:46:33] <myndzi> ugh
[18:46:35] <myndzi> facepalm moment
[18:46:42] <myndzi> why is there event.preventDefault in there?
[18:46:43] <shoky> why preventDefault?
[18:46:45] <shoky> heh.
[18:47:04] <b1lly1> LOL
[18:47:07] <myndzi> i have to sprinkle it liberally throughout the other events, must have made some copy paste error :\
[18:47:23] <myndzi> okay, back on track!
[18:50:24] <spobat> hi
[18:51:12] <lrtim> How do i add css to a div for example would it be something like this:
[18:51:45] <myndzi> $('selector').css('property', 'value');
[18:51:54] <lrtim> $('#rightControl').show.css('background-color', '#ccc')
[18:52:13] <myndzi> no .show
[18:53:08] <lrtim> hmm
[18:53:11] <lrtim> if you look at this
[18:53:12] <lrtim> http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/17/
[18:53:23] <lrtim> at the bottom of my js you can see that im trying to do it
[18:53:26] <chipnt> $('#rightControl').css('background-color', '#ccc')
[18:54:01] <lrtim> if you click the right arrow and go to the next slide it should make the right arrow then grey
[18:54:28] <aamax> hi all
[18:54:49] <aamax> I need some help with parsing a string in javascript.  my string looks like  "{:time=>[1,2,3],:measure=>[4,5,6],:entity=>[8,9,5,4]}"  I need to pull out each of the 3 blocks (arrays) of values and then use the values.  how can I do that?
[18:59:38] <jtm> How can I get a class to be added after a highlight effect?
[18:59:42] <jtm> For example I have:  $("#my-post").removeClass('info').effect("highlight", {color: "#b2dba1"}, 5000).addClass('info');
[18:59:54] <jtm> I tried adding a delay(5000)
[18:59:59] <jtm> to addClass
[19:00:39] <ner0x> Is it possible to select a piece of the DOM by the entire html of the pice?
[19:00:42] <ner0x> piece*
[19:01:00] <spobat> hi
[19:01:00] <coldhead> aamax: http://jsfiddle.net/K8xsv/
[19:01:10] <coldhead> turning the strings into native JS arrays is an exercise
[19:01:15] <spobat> I use the following snippet to always scroll to the bottom of my chat windows:
[19:01:21] <spobat> $('#chat-content').animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height()}, 500);
[19:01:31] <spobat> but the problem  is if a lot of chat messages appear, it starts scrolling to top
[19:01:34] <coldhead> consider exporting json rather than ruby literals, to make life easier
[19:01:42] <spobat> then it just scrolls to somewhere in the middle
[19:01:48] <spobat> I think the problem is $(document).height()
[19:02:02] <spobat> but I have no idea to which value I should set it
[19:02:03] <aamax> coldhead, thanks for the assist.  this will work great
[19:02:19] <coldhead> hooray for everything, even curried sausages
[19:02:41] <myNic> how do you select an element by css style
[19:03:35] <myNic> how do you select an element by css style (such as by background color)
[19:04:02] <coldhead> you can't
[19:04:26] <coldhead> you have to select every element in the dom and then provide a function to filter() that returns true if it has the color you want
[19:04:38] <coldhead> it's jQuery, not cssBackgroundColorQuery
[19:05:01] <lrtim> how do you make a div not clickable
[19:05:02] <shoky> well it SHOULD be
[19:05:07] <myNic> yeah
[19:05:22] <coldhead> it's trivial to add $.fn.filterByBackgroundColor()
[19:05:35] <coldhead> or even a custom pseudo selector
[19:05:47] <jtm> No one knows?
[19:05:48] <shoky> but plz don't
[19:05:50] <coldhead> trivial in the sense that archduke ferdinand's assination was trivial
[19:06:00] <coldhead> assassination oh god so embarass
[19:06:05] <myNic> onclick of the div return false
[19:06:40] <shoky> assination has a better ring to it
[19:06:52] <lrtim> myNic
[19:06:54] <lrtim> something like
[19:06:59] <coldhead> jtm: http://api.jqueryui.com/effect/ use the "complete" callback
[19:07:03] <lrtim> $('#rightControl').click(return false???)
[19:07:08] <coldhead> pass it a function to run when the fade is complete
[19:07:41] <coldhead> shoky: if that's a very subtle pun I AM APPALLED
[19:07:42] <shoky> jtm:  provide a callback to .effect()
[19:08:04] <myNic> $("div").click(function() {return false;}); should work
[19:08:09] <shoky> it's so subtle i didn't see it myself
[19:08:18] <coldhead> goodnight bentruyman's computer
[19:08:18] <shoky> and never will
[19:08:30] <coldhead> in that case carry on, shoky
[19:08:35] <coldhead> and let us never speak of this again
[19:08:46] <shoky> done. deal. deal done.
[19:08:58] <myNic> talk about what?
[19:09:02] <shoky> scones
[19:09:25] <myNic> never talk about that again
[19:09:36] <coldhead> god i miss scones
[19:09:45] <myNic> lrtim did that work?
[19:09:50] <lrtim> myNik: hmm have a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/18/
[19:09:55] <myNic> STOP!
[19:10:07] <coldhead> collaborate
[19:10:08] <lrtim> What im trying to do is make it so the user can't scroll pass the slides
[19:10:39] <coldhead> alert('please disconnect your mouse and keyboard')
[19:10:41] <lrtim> you will see how the slides become to nothing
[19:11:42] <myNic> yeah
[19:12:13] <lrtim> is it an easy fix?
[19:12:49] <myNic> use $("div").live("click", function() {return false;});
[19:13:26] <myNic> shoot hold on
[19:14:57] <coldhead> holding
[19:15:02] <b1lly> PENIS
[19:15:07] <myNic> ha
[19:15:42] <myNic> use the live function but define manage controls before $('.control').bind
[19:15:45] <coldhead> well if you don't the pee goes everywhere
[19:15:49] <coldhead> it's common courtesy
[19:15:55] <lrtim> myNik i dont undertsnad
[19:15:57] <coldhead> you think people LIKE cleaning bathrooms?
[19:16:02] <lrtim> understand*
[19:16:47] <lrtim> could you codepad what u mean to me
[19:17:35] <myNic> you have to define the function before you call it
[19:20:33] <myNic> when you call the function the curr position is -1 soo it will never be 0
[19:22:14] <myNic> plus you do the animation anyways in your bind statement so no matter when you click on it will always do it
[19:23:10] <aamax> coldhead, I was trying to do something more along the lines of:  https://gist.github.com/aamax/5242621
[19:23:25] <aamax> but the blocks var is being set to null.
[19:24:29] <myNic> :lrtim
[19:24:33] <myNic> you there?
[19:24:35] <lrtim> yes
[19:25:08] <lrtim> What would be better is that when the user clicks the arrows buttons it just keeps looping the current slides?
[19:25:16] <lrtim> But i have no idea how to do that
[19:25:29] <myNic> keep the original code you had and put if(currentPosition > 0) {} around $('#slideInner').animate({'marginLeft': slideWidth * (-currentPosition)});
[19:25:50] <myNic> and do the same to check if it is the last one too
[19:26:18] <lrtim> Is this for my question that i just asked?
[19:26:38] <myNic> yes
[19:27:03] <myNic> this will check to see if it is the first one so it will prevent the animation
[19:27:23] <lrtim> ok
[19:27:31] <lrtim> ill try it niw
[19:27:48] <lrtim> so where abouts would i put this sorry?
[19:27:51] <lrtim> in front of?
[19:28:32] <myNic>         // Move slideInner using margin-left         if(currentPosition > 0 && currentPostion < last) {         $('#slideInner').animate({             // Determine new position             currentPosition = ($(this).attr('id') == 'rightControl') ? currentPosition + 1 : currentPosition - 1;             // Hide / show controls             manageControls(currentPosition);             'marginLeft': slideWidth * (-currentPosition)         }
[19:28:47] <myNic> put this in $('.control').bind
[19:28:53] <myNic> replacing everything
[19:29:20] <myNic> just replace last with the last number in your slide show
[19:30:44] <myNic> does that make sense?
[19:30:46] <lrtim> Man im confused ok. Ill create a codepad and show you what ive done
[19:30:57] <myNic> alright
[19:31:40] <myNic> how do i access the code pad?
[19:31:56] <lrtim> i can show you it
[19:33:02] <omani_> how can I set the width of a flotchart?
[19:33:29] <lrtim> I just 'query' you myNik
[19:33:34] <lrtim> Nic*
[19:33:57] <omani_> I have the problem that when having many ticks, the labels below (like "month/year") get messed up
[19:34:04] <rael> ?find
[19:34:15] <myNic> what?
[19:34:45] <lrtim> ok so that code you gave me do i put it inide the bind fucntion?
[19:35:10] <coldhead> aamax: can't you just toJSON the object in ruby?
[19:35:27] <myNic> hold on
[19:36:00] <aamax> coldhead, unfortunately i'm processing this on on client side in angular so that won't work
[19:36:08] <aamax> i'd prefer to do it that way
[19:37:11] <lrtim> myNik could you use a codepad of some sort and paste the JS in it?
[19:37:33] <lrtim> myNic**
[19:37:40] <myNic> in your bind you want to sure that when you click it the currentPosition isn't the first or last one
[19:38:06] <myNic> if that makes sense
[19:38:28] <lrtim> I added some of that code
[19:38:29] <lrtim> http://jsfiddle.net/tebrown/d8YQU/20/
[19:38:33] <lrtim> but now its stuffed up
[19:38:46] <lrtim> have a look at the last bit of the nind function
[19:38:49] <lrtim> bind*
[19:39:17] <myNic> no no
[19:39:25] <myNic> ill show you hold on
[19:40:17] <lrtim> thanks
[19:47:24] <lrtim> myNic you there still?
[19:47:49] <myNic> yeah im testing hold on
[19:47:54] <lrtim> ok thanks
[19:48:46] <spobat> is there something like a listview in bootstrap or similars?
[19:50:15] <coldhead> ##twitter-bootstrap
[19:50:28] <myNic> http://jsfiddle.net/d8YQU/21/
[19:50:30] <myNic> here ya go
[19:50:39] <myNic> working as it should i think
[19:50:47] <spobat> coldhead, what? :D
[19:51:22] <lrtim> myNic thanks. Also we were talking about it looping?
[19:51:39] <myNic> what looping?
[19:51:43] <lrtim> So it just keeps cycling through the slides when they click the next arrow
[19:52:28] <lrtim> For example you have your left and right arrows. if the click the left arrow it will go to slide '2'.
[19:53:38] <myNic> im lost
[19:55:12] <myNic> edit the code so one of the pics is labled start of slide 2
[19:56:03] <lrtim> muNic
[19:56:39] <lrtim> What you have just done is good, but to make it even better it would be good if the user can jut keep cycling through.
[19:57:14] <lrtim> The left and right arrows will always be clickable, but depending on which arrow they click it will keep cycling through the amount of slides.
[20:08:11] <coldhead> riveting
[20:09:59] <hugo_moss> hey, i have added a lazy load script to my magento theme, but when i use an effect of fadein, the animation flickers. does anybody know why? i tested it without magento, and it works fine.
[20:23:41] <Guest97726> I'm trying to make a simple plot with FlotGraphs. I'm just doing $.plot($("#sipStatistic"), [ [[0, 3], [4, 8], [8, 5], [9, 13]] ]);
[20:24:30] <Guest97726> from a <script ...> tag in my HTML source. That works fine. When I move that line to a new JS file that I'm included as well, I get an error though:
[20:24:49] <Guest97726> "Uncaught Invalid dimensions for plot, width = null, height = null "
[20:25:07] <Guest97726> Why do I get an error when using the exact same line in another file?
[20:26:22] <coldhead> Guest97629: are you doing this inside $(document).ready() ?
[20:26:39] <coldhead> that error could arise if you're running the code too early
[20:26:50] <coldhead> so it can't find the element describved in your selector
[20:27:43] <kba> coldhead: I wasn't doing that, but now that I have wrapped my entire code in the other file in that, it works. Or well, sort of.
[20:27:59] <coldhead> great result
[20:28:01] <coldhead> case closed
[20:28:15] <kba> The graph is drawn now, but I also use $(document).ready(function() { in my HTML file and that is giving me trouble now, coldhead
[20:28:19] <kba> So not exactly.
[20:28:59] <kba> I have a file, academy.js, in there I define a class called Game and I also plot the graph from there. I initialize an instance of Game in my HTML file. I could do this just fine before, now I'm told that "Game is not defined".
[20:28:59] <coldhead> you should be able to have as many .ready() functions as you need
[20:29:02] <coldhead> just don't nest them
[20:29:11] <kba> I'm not.
[20:29:25] <kba> So I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm not that brilliant with JS.
[20:29:26] <coldhead> just put the .ready() around the stuff that uses the DOM
[20:29:36] <kba> It all does.
[20:29:36] <coldhead> don't put it around the var Game = {} stuff
[20:29:45] <kba> Hm.
[20:30:00] <coldhead> in that case, get rid of the .ready() and include the scripts at the very bottom of the page
[20:30:05] <coldhead> so the document will already be ready
[20:30:09] <kba> Well, if I don't do that, it still says "Game is not defined".
[20:30:13] <coldhead> but don't tell anyone i said to do that
[20:30:22] <kba> I'm guessing this makes sense, since the Game class isn't created until .ready() is being run.
[20:30:31] <coldhead> if Game is the oinly thing not defined try doing var Game outside the document.ready
[20:30:32] <kba> But I'm trying to instanciate a Game when it hasn't been defined.
[20:30:40] <coldhead> and refer to that var inside the .ready()
[20:31:06] <coldhead> so it will exist outside the ready() and you can access it
[20:31:13] <kba> I can't move it outside, it's all connected.
[20:31:19] <kba> Game has to be in .ready()
[20:31:23] <rael> anyone come across good custom styled jquery ui dialog
[20:31:36] <coldhead> change Game to window.Game
[20:31:40] <coldhead> and it will work outisde the ready
[20:31:52] <kba> new window.Game() ?
[20:32:16] <kba> well, ok, so that sort of works, now I get "Player is not defined"
[20:32:23] <kba> so I guess I could go around and do this 20 places
[20:32:24] <coldhead> window.Player
[20:32:29] <kba> but is that really the nice way to do it?
[20:32:34] <kba> It seems a bit messy
[20:32:43] <coldhead> no, but you're not interested in the nice way
[20:32:49] <coldhead> you're all "but it's all connected ;("
[20:32:49] <kba> I very much am
[20:33:07] <kba> Well, that kind of is a nice way.
[20:33:12] <coldhead> the correct way is to put all the stuff that needs to be DOM ready inside the $(document).ready()
[20:33:12] <kba> I have a Game that has a lot of Players.
[20:33:16] <kba> And those Players have Portraits.
[20:33:19] <kba> And those Portraits use the DOM.
[20:33:31] <kba> It's quite standard OOP, I think the code is pretty decent.
[20:33:31] <coldhead> if you're implicitly using globals by saying var Game outside of a function
[20:33:39] <coldhead> you might as well make it explicit and say window.Game
[20:33:49] <coldhead> it means the same thing but window.Game works inside .ready()
[20:34:18] <kba> Uhm...
[20:34:34] <kba> I'm not really using globals, I'm not saving my "new Game" if that's what you mean
[20:34:41] <kba> I'm just creating it. It's all there is in the HTML file.
[20:35:23] <coldhead> <script>var I_AM_GLOBAL</script> === <script>window.I_AM_GLOBAL</script>
[20:35:33] <kba> And I need it to be there, since it's dependent on some code I generate, e.g. new Game([new Player('coldhead',14), new Player('kba',10)]); etc.
[20:35:40] <kba> Hm.
[20:36:30] <kba> So if I do new window.Game([ new window.Player(...), ...]); I get "undefined is not a function"
[20:36:38] <kba> on the line with "new window.Player(...)"
[20:37:45] <kba> How would one usually do this? I can't imagine it being uncommon to instantiate a class in a HTML file, coldhead
[20:38:02] <coldhead> the common fix is if you need a global, use a global
[20:38:12] <coldhead> and JS globals are window.GLOBAL_HERE
[20:38:31] <kba> Game is defined by: var Game = (function() { ...
[20:38:37] <coldhead> lose the var
[20:38:45] <coldhead> window.Game = (...
[20:39:12] <kba> Oh, tat works.
[20:39:14] <kba> without a var.
[20:39:20] <kba> But shouldn't there be one?
[20:39:29] <kba> I'm having a hard time understanding scoping in JS
[20:39:36] <coldhead> no, you're attaching a new property, Game, to an existing js var, window
[20:39:53] <kba> I see.
[20:40:51] <kba> coldhead: thank you for your help. Do you have any references that might help improve my understanding of scoping in JS?
[20:41:01] <coldhead> i was just looking for one
[20:41:47] <coldhead> this isn't too long http://dailyjs.com/2012/07/23/js101-scope/
[20:42:22] <kba> I was just skimming http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-javascript-scope/
[20:42:30] <kba> that one mentions Prototyping
[20:42:34] <kba> so I guess that's better, no?
[20:42:42] <coldhead> they both suck in different ways
[20:42:44] <kba> seeing that I am using Prototyping
[20:42:49] <kba> write me one!
[20:43:58] <coldhead> none of these articles contain the string window.
[20:45:08] <kba> oh btw, now that I got you, I have another scoping question if that's okay
[20:46:12] <coldhead> shoot, i'm just 2 hours overdue for lunch
[20:46:16] <kba> I have a Plot = (function() { var points = []; and a function Plot.prototype.addPoint = function(x,y) { this.points.push(x,y); } ... });
[20:46:34] <kba> but that doesn't seem to work, push is undefined, because apparently points isn't in the same scope as my function
[20:46:46] <kba> well, I'm a few hours overdue for bed, so it should all even out :)
[20:47:07] <kba> if I do function Plot() { this.points = []; } it works
[20:47:16] <coldhead> yes, that's what you need
[20:47:18] <kba> but why?
[20:47:29] <coldhead> having something in a closure is not the same as having it as a property of this
[20:47:46] <kba> so where is var points defined?
[20:47:51] <coldhead> the var points; thing makes points available to code INSIDE that function () {}
[20:47:53] <kba> what's the purpose of being able to do that? if any
[20:47:56] <coldhead> but it doesn't expose it
[20:48:17] <coldhead> http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/closures.shtml
[20:48:32] <kba> I'd expect it to behave like a field variable in e.g. Java, so that the other members may access it
[20:48:38] <kba> so who can access it?
[20:48:44] <coldhead> things in the same function
[20:48:48] <kba> only the code not written within inner functions?
[20:48:49] <coldhead> JS has function scope
[20:49:00] <coldhead> so a var inside that function is scoped to that function
[20:49:00] <kba> Hm...
[20:49:11] <coldhead> and any other code/functions within that function
[20:49:16] <kba> Well, yes, of course, but I'm trying to access it from a function within a function
[20:49:32] <kba> if I was to draw a scoping diagram, I'd still be trying to access it from within the box - just from an "inner box"
[20:49:41] <kba> exactly, within that function
[20:49:45] <coldhead> Plot.prototype.addPoint looks like it's ouside the function
[20:50:14] <kba> coldhead: http://paste.debian.net/244687/
[20:50:43] <kba> how would I access "var points" from Plot.prototype.addPoint. As you can see, it's defined inside Plot
[20:51:01] <coldhead> you're abusing this
[20:51:02] <coldhead> http://paste.debian.net/244688/
[20:51:06] <coldhead> you don't ened it
[20:51:13] <coldhead> those functions have access to points already
[20:51:20] <coldhead> because they're in the same scope
[20:51:28] <kba> oh...
[20:51:46] <coldhead> read a bunch of different artciles on JS closures
[20:51:50] <kba> so when I define something as this.foo it's public, but var foo is private?
[20:51:51] <coldhead> give it a few days to sing in
[20:51:56] <coldhead> yes
[20:51:57] <coldhead> i mean
[20:51:58] <coldhead> kind of
[20:52:04] <coldhead> JS isn't really like Java
[20:52:17] <coldhead> they can be used for that kind of role
[20:52:25] <coldhead> but i think it's better to understand them natively
[20:52:40] <coldhead> rather than to translate them into Java terms
[20:53:16] <coldhead> maybe this post by one of JS's foremost champions will help http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/understanding-javascript-closures/
[20:54:26] <kba> I'm realizing I need a lot of refactorization now...
[20:54:35] <kba> ;-) But thanks a lot
[20:55:01] <coldhead> it's worth it, closures are your friends
[20:57:16] <initself> \q
[20:57:17] <initself> .quit
[20:57:34] <coldhead> initself took the bot out too :(
[21:00:19] <relipse>  can someone please help me, my cworklog.com server is sending out mail() fine, except yahoo email addresses do not receive it (it doesn't even go to spam folder) what could be the problem?
[21:00:59] <steven10172> I'm currently working with jQuery Accordion and I was trying to force a scroll with $('#playlistAccordion').scrollTop('800');  and it doesn't seem to work.   My Code:  http://twclaimer.com/iTunesToYouTube/new.html
[21:00:59] <coldhead> one of the problems is that THIS IS #jQuery, NOT #fixing_everything_ever
[21:02:50] <rebel_yell> hey gys
[21:02:55] <rebel_yell> quick code question
[21:02:59] <rebel_yell> so i have $('div.listings:lt(8)').show();
[21:03:23] <rebel_yell> which shows 8 listings , when i click a link called 'More' I want 8 more to show
[21:04:21] <rebel_yell> so it would be like i=8 when a.more click i+=8
[21:05:05] <coldhead> rebel_yell: you might like to use the :visible or :hidden pseudoselectors
[21:05:14] <coldhead> to select elements that aren't visible yet
[21:05:34] <coldhead> $('div.listings:hidden:lt(8)').show();
[21:05:39] <coldhead> should show 8 at a time
[21:06:30] <steven10172> is there specific situations where scrollTop() wont work?
[21:07:22] <Andrew_R> doesn't work how?
[21:07:47] <steven10172> I'm currently working with jQuery Accordion and I was trying to force a scroll with $('#playlistAccordion').scrollTop('800');  and it doesn't seem to work. It does nothing
[21:07:49] <rebel_yell> coldhead: cool
[21:08:02] <coldhead> scrollTOp probably doesn't work on node.js
[21:08:19] <rebel_yell> coldhead: so every time they click next 3 more are visible
[21:08:48] <coldhead> 8 more
[21:08:48] <Andrew_R> steven10172:  don't use a string, scrollTop() takes a number, so just $('#playlistAccordion').scrollTop(800);
[21:08:55] <coldhead> hopefully, yes
[21:09:01] <steven10172> that doesn't seem to work either
[21:10:01] <Andrew_R> right above that line, what does alert($('#playlistAccordion').length); show?
[21:15:43] <coldhead> Andrew_R: it shows 0 for me
[21:15:59] <coldhead> just so you don't feel ignored
[21:16:00] <coldhead> :P
[21:17:27] <Andrew_R> coldhead: :)
[21:17:29] <Andrew_R>  either #playlistAccordion doesn't exist yet, or the selector should be something like '#playlistAccordion > div'
[21:19:11] <tw2113> about time coldhead actually asked jQuery questions
[21:19:24] <tw2113> he's been freeloading all day
[21:23:44] <greengriminal_> Anyone here
[21:23:56] <Andrew_R> nope :)
[21:24:03] <greengriminal_> :P
[21:24:24] <coldhead> EVERYONE SHUT UP, I AM TRYING TO THINK
[21:25:43] <Andrew_R> coldhead: you scared that guy off
[21:25:49] <greengriminal_> Back
[21:25:50] <Andrew_R> haha oops
[21:26:01] <coldhead> THAT GUY WAS A JERK
[21:26:06] <coldhead> oh welcome back buddy
[21:26:08] <coldhead> how's everything
[21:26:10] <greengriminal_> :O
[21:26:11] <Andrew_R> lol
[21:26:19] <coldhead> was just talking about you
[21:26:25] <coldhead> all good, don't worry
[21:26:31] <greengriminal_> was it now. Nice
[21:26:41] <greengriminal_> well before you two lay in to me
[21:26:52] <coldhead> i'll hold him, you punch him Andrew_R
[21:27:41] <Andrew_R> greengriminal_:  I hope you have a good jquery question for us
[21:28:04] <greengriminal_> your going to laugh the pair of you
[21:28:10] <coldhead> you're*
[21:28:29] <greengriminal_> I am hesitating to ask
[21:28:39] <coldhead> it's okay, this isn't ##php
[21:29:55] <greengriminal_> Basically i have the following: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5243128#file-application-js-L17 and I want to create an alert once the "create" action is called again.
[21:30:13] <coldhead> I'm not laughing
[21:30:24] <coldhead> i'm struggling to stay conscious
[21:30:55] <Andrew_R> what does "called again" mean?
[21:31:14] <Andrew_R> have you heard about the alert() function?
[21:31:24] <greengriminal_> Yeah i have
[21:31:30] <Andrew_R> :)
[21:32:23] <coldhead> great work everyone
[21:32:24] <coldhead> case closed
[21:33:35] <kba> coldhead: damn you!
[21:33:43] <kba> coldhead: var points is goddamn static
[21:33:56] <kba> been working with that shit 40 minutes now
[21:34:03] <kba> just now realizing that var foo is static and this.foo isn't
[21:34:16] <kba> seriously wtf
[21:34:26] <kba> why wouldn't you tell me that?
[21:34:50] <coldhead> i can tell you exactly why i didn't tell you about whatever it is you're talking about
[21:34:59] <coldhead> because I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
[21:35:05] <kba> http://paste.debian.net/244688/
[21:35:09] <kba> remember that? about 40 minutes ago?
[21:35:23] <coldhead> yes i remember you and your problems
[21:35:37] <coldhead> static is a CSS thing as far as i know
[21:35:41] <coldhead> i don't see the relevance
[21:35:43] <coldhead> GOOD DAY SIR
[21:35:52] <tw2113> i said GOOD DAY
[21:35:59] <kba> static means that the variable is the same across all instances of an object
[21:36:12] <kba> you said JS wasn't like Java, so I assumed you had knowledge of Java
[21:36:32] <kba> if I define multiple "new Plots" using your code, the points variable will be the same in all the damn objects
[21:37:09] <kba> ls
[21:37:15] <kba> wrong window
[21:37:25] <kba> but still, damn you, man
[21:37:29] <kba> uncool
[21:39:57] <cppexpert> Hi guys. I'm learning jQuery (and JavaScript) and as I was going through tutorial I stumbled upon this code snippet
[21:39:58] <cppexpert> $("#myDiv a:first").attr( "href", function( idx, href ) {
[21:39:58] <cppexpert>     return "/new/" + href;
[21:39:58] <cppexpert> });
[21:40:06] <cppexpert> from here http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/manipulating-elements/
[21:40:36] <cppexpert> Could you please tell me why function was defined with two parameters ? Are those params supposed to have meaningful values ?
[21:40:51] <cppexpert> I checked in the debugger and it's 0 and undefined.
[21:41:06] <kba> cppexpert: idx is the matched element in question
[21:41:20] <kba> oh... well, it is supposed to be
[21:41:37] <vladikoff> cppexpert, http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr-attributeName-functionindex--attr
[21:42:17] <cppexpert> Ah I see. Thank you, vladikoff. I'll be back :)
[21:45:01] <Andrew_R> your second parameter (href) is undefined because you are missing href from your <a>?
[21:45:07] <cppexpert> Yep :)
[21:45:47] <cppexpert> I just didn't know why those params are there in the first place. I thought it was just inline call of parameterless function hence there can be no parameters.
[21:58:20] <Andrew_R> cppexpert:  The correct term for a function declared in that way is anonymous function. You are defining a callback function that .attr() will call. Callbacks can (and often do) have data passed to them in parameters.
[22:04:48] <cppexpert> Got it. Thanks.
[22:06:06] <djshotglass> $('#inputAmount').on('input', function(){});
[22:06:06] <djshotglass> how do i fire that after setting it
[22:06:17] <djshotglass> eg on the select i did $("#selectAmount").change(function () {}).change();
[22:08:57] <Andrew_R> djshotglass: fiddle?
[22:13:19] <Andrew_R> I just converted most of my .js files into .cshtml files
[23:27:29] <nabi> I want when I click on (x) the message fadeOut, see: http://jsfiddle.net/NabiKAZ/XzeJh/
[23:34:55] <nabi> i find it: http://jsfiddle.net/NabiKAZ/XzeJh/1/
[23:51:22] <dwarder> ls
[23:52:28] <dwarder> what is chzn-container? and why it is applied to my <select> element jquery-ui.js included to my html file
[23:52:40] <dwarder> and it applied in a weird way
[23:53:12] <dwarder> it makes all options (<option>) it makes them <li> elements?
[23:55:05] <Cork> dwarder: can't find any trace of that in the jquery lib
[23:56:30] <devslash> does anyone know of a jquery plugin where I can point to a location on my server and it will display a scrollable list of files and directories ?
[23:56:59] <Cork> devslash: a plugin can't do that
[23:57:04] <dwarder> Cork: it is a class 'chzn-container'
[23:57:12] <devslash> why ?
[23:57:19] <Cork> you must have a server script that does the file listing
[23:57:39] <devslash> i have a jquery plugin that pretty much does that using a PHP connector script
[23:57:53] <Cork> dwarder: i meant the phrase "chzn-container" doens't exist in jquery or jquery-ui
[23:58:02] <devslash> but the layout is not quite what i want for a mobile device
[23:59:19] <dwarder> Cork: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/587 i found this
[23:59:19] <b-ot> dwarder: Issue #587 by raulfernandez (11mon 5d ago): CSS - Dropdown elements' width relative to its container (.chzn-container)
