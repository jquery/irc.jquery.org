[00:01:33] <ZeuZ> eldho, any advices? (sorry to be so annoying)
[00:13:40] <Murugaratham> ZeuZ: console.log(datos); <- wat's inside
[00:14:09] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, it'd just return a <h3>works!</h3>
[00:14:22] <ZeuZ> however instead of replacing the contents of the div, it replaces the whole screen
[00:15:36] <ZeuZ> hmm, let me rephrase that: it'll rewrite everything with just that result
[00:15:42] <ZeuZ> there, it sounded more correct
[00:16:15] <Murugaratham> can u paste the div?
[00:16:23] <djino> How can I call some javascript code when an element loads on a page? I.e., a #nav window appears (after a user refreshes a window) and I'd want to immediatelly scroll to it
[00:16:51] <djino> #nav element*
[00:16:57] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, yeah, pastebin is ok?
[00:17:07] <Murugaratham> yup
[00:17:34] <fire> Hi. i'm using valumns fileuploader with jquery to upload images via xhr. my problem is, that the upload works great in alle browsers, expected firefox 3.5.9. there is no data which will send as post
[00:18:04] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, http://pastebin.com/5sB78a3L
[00:18:23] <ZeuZ> there it's the CSS for that div, and the div as it's used there..
[00:20:28] <tehOPEologist> hey all
[00:21:02] <Murugaratham> djino: use anchors? ._.
[00:21:03] <tehOPEologist> was wondering if someone could help me make this carousel i used to incorporate links for each image: http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/
[00:21:30] <tehOPEologist> tried replacing img with a, but it doesn't work the way you'd expect..
[00:21:42] <djino> Murugaratham, I can't in this particular situation
[00:22:21] <jomofcw> Morning !
[00:22:49] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, any ideas?
[00:22:59] <Murugaratham> im seeing ^^
[00:25:19] <jrockjiggz> ?prepend
[00:25:20] <bot-t> .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[00:25:37] <jrockjiggz> ?before
[00:25:37] <bot-t> .before(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[00:26:09] <Murugaratham> ZeuZ: $("#cuerpo_principal_login").html("<h3>It works!</h3>");
[00:26:33] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, that's what the script returns
[00:26:43] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, I want it to write the response from the server there
[00:26:48] <Murugaratham> http://pastebin.com/nSx1Xjxa
[00:26:53] <Murugaratham> change ur html to this first
[00:26:57] <skylamer> is there other way to make some content with javascript without to specify it in the js file ?
[00:27:05] <Murugaratham> ur closing </div> is right below the form
[00:27:10] <skylamer> something like dynamic html with js creating??????
[00:27:12] <Murugaratham> that's why the whole oform changes
[00:27:38] <sac> skylamer, sure you can get the content from another file via ajax for example
[00:27:53] <Murugaratham> skylamer: static content?
[00:28:17] <skylamer> mm when its specified in js and then added to html its static?
[00:28:26] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, because the form has to be inside the div, if I do that, it'll kill the purpouse
[00:28:42] <skylamer> is there a way may be with jQuery to make with some methods a dynamiclly generated content?
[00:28:47] <ZeuZ> also, it should leave the div's form but replace the content, ain't that right? instead of reriting the whole thing
[00:28:47] <Murugaratham> y can't u use the selectors for the password and userid?
[00:29:08] <skylamer> so when open a html page this content isnt in the html and add it later when some eventhandle occur dynamiccly
[00:29:08] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, the thing is "the design" will break if I do that
[00:29:22] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, it does "look like it should" right now, but doesn't work as intended
[00:30:17] <Murugaratham> u want to update?
[00:30:32] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, yeah, I want to update the content of that div
[00:30:39] <Murugaratham> the whole form?
[00:30:56] <tehOPEologist> was wondering if someone could help me make this carousel i used to incorporate links for each image: http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/
[00:31:11] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham the whole content of the div
[00:31:42] <ZeuZ> the content, so that I just parse the reply and write it inside the rounded-border frame
[00:32:09] <ZeuZ> perhaps what's actually wrong is that I'm not catching the click event on the button?
[00:32:29] <Murugaratham> im just using firebug to try to do what u are saying
[00:32:41] <Murugaratham> $("#cuerpo_principal_login").html("<h3>test</h3>"); <- it adds the h3 fine
[00:32:49] <ZeuZ> no it doesnt
[00:32:57] <ZeuZ> If I add that to the document and test it, it breaks
[00:33:27] <ZeuZ> wait the problem is somewhere else
[00:33:46] <ZeuZ> it's just ignoring that part, it seems like I ain't cathing the click in the button
[00:34:03] <Murugaratham> well, it works on my end
[00:34:12] <Murugaratham> u dun have firebug/chrome inspector?
[00:34:17] <Murugaratham> just do this: $("#cuerpo_principal_login").html("<h3>it works</h3>");
[00:34:29] <Murugaratham> since this is wat happens after your ajax callback
[00:34:57] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, that works with firebug but when I copy that code and reload the page, I changed it to something else, and it didn't reply that, but the other thing
[00:34:58] <ZeuZ> http://pastebin.com/w02JTtAV
[00:35:06] <ZeuZ> I ain't catching the click in the button
[00:35:14] <ZeuZ> even though it apparently should, could you check that?
[00:35:22] <ZeuZ> it's just the jQuery part
[00:35:31] <ZeuZ> the div id of the button is enviar
[00:36:56] <encompass> When I make new html in the dom object with jquery I want to have it selectable but can't seem to see that data, what is the method to make that happen?
[00:37:04] <jrockjiggz> hi, i have some <script></script> google ad i want to insert into the dom
[00:37:18] <juha___> i think i should relax littlebit.. i had a nightmare about server with 32 fans in it..
[00:38:11] <jrockjiggz> encompass: prop)_
[00:38:14] <jrockjiggz> prop()
[00:39:09] <encompass> jrockjiggz: I am wanting to enter new data in a form I created with jquery.  I don't think prop is the ticket.
[00:40:47] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, yes, that's the trouble, I'm not cathing the click event, but I don't see the error there
[00:41:00] <antaranian> hi ladies
[00:41:09] <Jakey> no ladies here
[00:41:12] <Jakey> onl homo
[00:41:15] <sunmao> Hi! I would like to create a file upload form, but the <input type="file"> tag is too ugly  and customizable, that's why I did a trick. The problem is when I specify the name property in this tag the upload will not work in IE. check it here: http://jsfiddle.net/W3a3J/35/ use the browse and upload buttons.
[00:41:15] <Murugaratham> ZeuZ: $(".enviar").click
[00:41:38] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, why . and not # there?
[00:42:33] <Ely^> Hi, is tehre a great ay to hive a radiobutton value and display that in a  tooltip on hovering the radiobutton?
[00:43:18] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, also, it ain't working either with .
[00:44:25] <enerel1> is it possible to change printer settings by jquery
[00:47:22] <Murugaratham> ZeuZ: $("#enviar").click(function () {
[00:47:23] <Murugaratham>     alert("test");
[00:47:23] <Murugaratham> });
[00:47:31] <Murugaratham> mine is fine
[00:47:35] <Murugaratham> can u do a debug
[00:47:47] <encompass> I have a form I am creating with jquery but when I try to add val to it is ignored, I think it's because it was created after the innitial dom was created.  How can I fix that?
[00:50:44] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham not for me
[00:50:55] <ZeuZ> want me to upload it somewhere so you can see that DOESN'T work? ;p
[00:51:04] <encompass> is it live? if so, what is the event type that I use
[00:51:11] <ZeuZ> maybe there's something else wrong you're not catching due to checking it with firebug
[00:51:18] <Murugaratham> aha
[00:51:24] <Murugaratham> wat browser u using?
[00:51:40] <Murugaratham> the thing you trying to do is rather straightforward
[00:51:54] <Murugaratham> y not change the $.ajax to just a console.log or alert
[00:52:00] <Murugaratham> just to prove that it works
[00:52:19] <Murugaratham> encompass: wat u trying to do

[00:54:00] <ZeuZ> doesn't work either with ie nor chrome

[00:54:10] <enerel1> how to file a function after custom function?
[00:54:14] <Murugaratham> u tried replacing the $.ajax with log?
[00:54:22] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, tried alerting it and it doesn't worjk
[00:54:40] <encompass> Murugaratham: when a user clicks an object it will create a form entirely in jquery, then I need to fill the form with some data, all with jquery/js.  I can create the form, but I can't add the data to the form.
[00:54:40] <enerel1> how to fire a fadein after a custom function?
[00:55:19] <Murugaratham> ZeuZ: errors?
[00:55:29] <ZeuZ> I'll see how can I make WAMP allow external connections so that you can see first-hand
[00:55:34] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham none
[00:55:41] <Cork> enerel1: what kind of custom function are you talking about?
[00:55:43] <Murugaratham> just use dyndns lol
[00:56:24] <ZeuZ> Murugaratham, won't work
[00:56:33] <Murugaratham> encompass: show something on pastebin?

[01:44:55] <Guest93887> Brill - thanks everyone for your patience
[01:45:11] <MoTiOnXml> whoohoo - just finalized a kick ass ribbon ui design
[01:45:25] <MoTiOnXml> using microsoft specifications but clean graphics
[01:45:28] <MoTiOnXml> loving it
[01:45:58] <borwar> Guest93887: Cant you just place the Vimeo gallery in a div and hide it? Then show it when thumbnail is clicked?
[01:47:50] <Guest93887> borwar: possibly - and if you can point me in the right direction that would be great - but would the video not still play if it was hidden?
[01:48:32] <borwar> not if it is set to not autostart
[01:49:12] <borwar> Look into $.show() $.hide()
[01:51:07] <Guest93887> borwar: now THAT is something I can do ;) - the problem is, is that the way the code is setup is the parameters are setup when he page is loaded and then passed to player when it is clicked so if I turn autplay off, it won't play when the thumbnail is clicked either - they'll have to click play as well - that's how I understand anyway
[02:06:25] <Guest93887> I FIGURED IT OUT!!!! this line - $('.player-list a.item:first').click(); - was the source of all my problems! Thanks SO MUCH for your help!
[02:11:35] <ZeuZ> Is there any way to add a delay? without using setTimeout that is
[02:13:56] <Aamir> ?delay @ZeuZ
[02:13:56] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[02:14:02] <quicksilver> why "without using setTimeout" though?
[02:14:24] <quicksilver> the jquery delay function is for delaying animatons (normally - or queues more generally)
[02:14:46] <quicksilver> setTimeout is the right general approach.
[02:14:49] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, was curious about another way to do it
[02:15:02] <ZeuZ> I ended up using setTimeout so that can be closed :)
[02:15:47] <quicksilver> javascript is single-threaded - if you had a simple 'delay' function  you'd lock the page.
[02:15:59] <quicksilver> that's why everything is done via callbacks like setTimeout
[02:17:06] <ZeuZ> the thing is I'm just not doing anything so I did a setTimeout("",1000); but still sometimes the script just "skips it"
[02:18:33] <quicksilver> setTimeout("",1000) does absolutely nothing.
[02:18:46] <quicksilver> you have to put the rest of your code in a callback.
[02:19:02] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, well the idea is to "pause" it so that an animation can play heeh
[02:19:12] <quicksilver> the only way to pause something is to put it in a callback.
[02:19:23] <quicksilver> if you have an animation which is playing anyway, why not put it in the animation's callback?
[02:19:26] <ZeuZ> I just changed that to an alert box, and it didn't go as expected
[02:19:37] <ZeuZ> because it's not quite like that
[02:19:38] <AdvoWork> hi there. im using a the datepicker plugin, and it loads the new window type thing, and it will close down if i click off that window. I can't find the code, or section that would relate to clicking off the div/window to close something, any ideas please? im trying to add a button "Close" to do the same..
[02:19:54] <ZeuZ> first I'm calling slideToggle(), then "pausing it" then using an ajax request
[02:20:02] <ZeuZ> the pause step is skipped
[02:20:20] <ZeuZ> (and to make it worse, it's sometimes skipped)
[02:21:16] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: I feel I am failing to get a poitn across to you. THERE IS NO PAUSE.
[02:21:20] <quicksilver> YOU CANNOT PAUSE.
[02:21:24] <quicksilver> all you can do is set a callback.
[02:21:44] <quicksilver> dosomething; pause 100; dosomethingelse; // This is not possible
[02:22:17] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, I KNOW i'm placing it in quotes just because of that
[02:22:24] <quicksilver> dosomething. setTimeout(function() { dosomethingelse; },100)
[02:22:28] <quicksilver> is all you can do.
[02:22:29] <ZeuZ> the idea is this:
[02:22:43] <ZeuZ> well, not the idea, what I'm doing and it's failing :P
[02:22:50] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: paste the code.
[02:23:11] <ZeuZ> $("#enviar").slideToggle(); setTimeout("alert(\"testing\");",1000); and then the ajax request
[02:23:39] <juha___> yay alerts
[02:23:54] <juha___> ?console @ ZeuZ
[02:23:54] <bot-t> ZeuZ, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[02:24:14] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: never pass a string to setTimeout.
[02:24:29] <quicksilver> setTimeout(function() { alert("testing") }, 1000)
[02:24:31] <ZeuZ> it "does sometimes work" tho :P haha
[02:24:45] <quicksilver> but if you're using a slideToggle why not use the callback from the slideToggle anyway?
[02:25:27] <ZeuZ> because I don't know how to do that?
[02:25:43] <quicksilver> have you read any of the jQuery docs at all? :P
[02:25:45] <ZeuZ> this is not like LRESULT WinAPI CallBack
[02:26:01] <quicksilver> $("#enviar").slideToggle('slow',function () { alert ("animation complete"); });
[02:26:03] <ZeuZ> (sorry, the most I've used callbacks is with the Windows API so that doesn't apply here hehe)
[02:27:29] <ZeuZ> well that has exactly the same problem :P it sometimes work, not allways
[02:27:38] <ZeuZ> perhaps the browser? ffx4
[02:29:18] <quicksilver> I can't imagine why that would not always work. It's very simple
[02:29:31] <ZeuZ> trust me, today, simple things have become comples
[02:29:32] <quicksilver> what do you mean by "not work"? what happens when it doesn't work?
[02:29:46] <ZeuZ> It just skips the alert
[02:29:49] <quicksilver> The most likely explanation is you have other things on your page which you haven't told me about which break it.
[02:29:51] <ZeuZ> and skips the timeout
[02:29:58] <ZeuZ> and goes straight through it
[02:30:02] <quicksilver> can you link the page? or paste the entire code?
[02:30:25] <ZeuZ> yeah, as Murugaratham did, you can even see it personally if you want through teamviewer
[02:31:16] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: where's the link then?
[02:32:45] <ZeuZ> Order deny,allow
[02:32:45] <ZeuZ>     Deny from None
[02:32:46] <ZeuZ> argh
[02:32:52] <ZeuZ> that was what I was trying to get out of WAMP
[02:32:59] <ZeuZ> it won't allow you to see it through the public IP
[02:34:04] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, there, go now
[02:34:26] <ZeuZ> anything in the inputs would do
[02:34:49] <ZeuZ> try it several times, for me (maybe being in the localhost also makes for it being trouble) the second time is allready jinxed
[02:34:58] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: go where?
[02:35:40] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, what I pm'd you
[02:36:00] <VictorCL2> what can be causing a mouseover not working on a label =
[02:36:01] <VictorCL2> ?
[02:37:04] <quicksilver> ok.
[02:38:35] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: well you can't click it a second time because the first time you click it the ajax request clears the whole div anyway?
[02:40:08] <quicksilver> ZeuZ: animations don't work very well on form elements to be honest - in chrom that's not really an animation at all.
[02:40:10] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, but you can refresh the page
[02:40:27] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, well it's good to know that though
[02:40:36] <quicksilver> yes, I can refresh the page
[02:40:43] <quicksilver> I always get the alert
[02:40:48] <quicksilver> although the ajax is always faster anyway
[02:40:58] <quicksilver> did you want to delay the AJAX also?
[02:41:17] <quicksilver> did you want the ajax to not happen until after the animation / alert
[02:42:03] <ZeuZ> exactly
[02:42:09] <ZeuZ> that's what I was trying to express before...
[02:42:20] <ZeuZ> languaje barriers and the fact that it's 6:42AM and I haven't slept
[02:42:31] <quicksilver> then you have to put the AJAX call inside the callback.
[02:42:35] <quicksilver> which is what I was trying to express
[02:42:39] <quicksilver> THERE IS NO DELAY FUNCTION
[02:42:44] <quicksilver> THERE ARE ONLY CALLBACKS :)
[02:42:52] <quicksilver> everything, which you want to happen later, must be inside the callback.
[02:44:49] <ZeuZ> so the whole module call to ajax has to be there, got it
[02:47:41] <sterna> hey, i'm using $.getJSON and get an error in jquery in xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );

[03:00:13] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all
[03:01:48] <Whirl3d> I am looking for just a smidge of help with animation queues. I need to stop an animation and clear an items animation queue, but leave the item in its destination state. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/W2NYH/16/
[03:03:23] <Wipp> Why doesn't this work, please help: http://jsfiddle.net/bHVud/
[03:03:52] <Whirl3d> Wipp, maybe you should describe what the problem is
[03:04:29] <Wipp> Whirl3d: Isn't it obvious by looking at the code?
[03:05:14] <quicksilver> Wipp: 'this' isn't likely to be defined in calcSum
[03:05:50] <toxz> somehow like that: http://pastebin.com/dETRayim
[03:06:13] <toxz> Whirl3d
[03:06:50] <quicksilver> Wipp: also "closest" won't find what you want it to find because it isn't a parent of the element concerned.
[03:07:33] <Wipp> Okay, so I use sibling then, good stuff
[03:07:49] <quicksilver> Wipp: http://jsfiddle.net/bHVud/1/
[03:08:00] <toxz> how can i get the first parent of an element which has a specific type - somehow like $(this).parent('tr') ?
[03:08:02] <Whirl3d> So, Wipp and Toxz have the same exact problem, huh? Sounds like someone wants us to do their womework for them. Toxz, look at Wipps answer
[03:08:13] <Whirl3d> *homework
[03:08:19] <quicksilver> toxz: .closest('tr')
[03:08:41] <Wipp> quicksilver: thanks
[03:08:41] <toxz> we use jquery 1.2.6 - no .closest here
[03:08:45] <toxz> :-(
[03:08:52] <quicksilver> then right it yourself.
[03:08:53] <quicksilver> erm
[03:08:56] <quicksilver> write it yourself.
[03:09:08] <quicksilver> keep calling parent until you find one that matches.
[03:09:15] <antris> is there an equivalent of http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#detect in jquery
[03:09:31] <Wipp> eh no homework here, I'm doing this crap for a living
[03:09:39] <toxz> isnt there another way - why i can give .parent() a selector param
[03:09:54] <quicksilver> toxz: No, there isn't another way, that's why closest was written.
[03:10:10] <quicksilver> antris: I don't think so - that's why lots of people like to use underscore with jQuery.
[03:10:23] <Aamir> ?parents @toxz
[03:10:24] <bot-t> toxz, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:10:33] <antris> yeah, it's just that we already have a global called _ in our app :P
[03:10:41] <antris> for i18n
[03:11:13] <Whirl3d> ?dequeue
[03:11:13] <bot-t> .dequeue([queueName]): Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[03:11:54] <dumbRoss> Evening all
[03:11:57] <toxz> Aamir - thx
[03:12:54] <Aamir> toxz:  $(this).parents('tr:first')
[03:12:57] <toxz> quicksilver - $(this).parents('tr:first').addClass('active');
[03:13:01] <toxz> yeah
[03:13:56] <quicksilver> good.
[03:14:08] <quicksilver> antris: so use http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#noConflict and pick another name? :)
[03:14:08] <dsdeiz> hi say i have $('.foo').mousedown(function() { $('.bar').mousedown(function() { [how do i call the $(this) for .foo? :D
[03:14:19] <antris> quicksilver: guess i'll do that :)
[03:14:30] <quicksilver> dsdeiz: save it into another variable outside the .bar callback.
[03:15:54] <antris> lol at the code examples
[03:15:55] <antris> _(3).times(function(){ genie.grantWish(); });

[03:33:27] <no-gooder> thenks Deele  ;)
[03:33:34] <no-gooder> thanks*:S
[03:35:04] <eml> no-gooder: [0] should be irrelevant for the filter() functions since ids are (should be) unique
[03:35:18] <Deele> no-gooder, you dont need to "update" it @jsfiddle, all the time, just use Run or "Control + Shift + Return" hotkey
[03:36:09] <Deele> additionally, $(a).filter('#a1')[0]; could be optimizet to just $('#a1',a);
[03:36:14] <Deele> *d
[03:43:59] <sean`> HI DEELE
[03:44:13] <sean`> <Deele> additionally, $(a).filter('#a1')[0]; could be optimizet to just $('#a1',a);
[03:44:23] <sean`> that's like, A LIE
[03:44:44] <sean`> If you just need the element, your best bet would just be var a1 = document.getElementById ('a1')
[03:44:53] <sean`> Want to use jQuery? $('#a1')
[03:45:16] <sean`> $('#a1', a) == $('a #a1') == $('a').find ('#a1')
[03:45:22] <sean`> which i snothing like $('a').filter ('#a1')
[03:46:40] <quicksilver> sean`: (...or $(a).filter which was actually written...)
[03:46:57] <sean`> quicksilver, WAT?
[03:47:40] <quicksilver> $('a').filter ('#a1') and $(a).filter('#a1') are rather different
[03:47:43] <quicksilver> obviously you know that ;)
[03:48:09] <sean`> not really
[03:48:20] <sean`> first one is a string, second is a variable
[03:48:27] <quicksilver> yes.
[03:48:28] <sean`> what's the big deal?
[03:48:31] <quicksilver> :)
[03:48:32] <sean`> You're still filtering a set
[03:48:34] <sean`> USING AN ID
[03:48:41] <sean`> $('#a1'), id's are unique babe
[03:48:53] <quicksilver> unless the point is, you don't want it, unless it's already in "a"
[03:48:56] <quicksilver> or a
[03:49:04] <sean`> the point is, id's are unique
[03:49:06] <quicksilver> yes.
[03:49:11] <quicksilver> I accept that point and understand it well.
[03:49:18] <sean`> so, you don't need filter
[03:49:21] <sean`> the element is there or not
[03:49:31] <quicksilver> $('#a1') will find it whereever it is in the document
[03:49:35] <sean`> yes
[03:49:46] <quicksilver> $(a).filter('#a1') will pick it out only if it is in a, whatever a represents.
[03:49:47] <sean`> ANd if your markup is okay, it'll be fine
[03:50:01] <sean`> quicksilver, but don't you get, that if an ID is unique, it doesn't matter?
[03:50:08] <sean`> You should use classes for that
[03:50:11] <sean`> or data attributes
[03:50:13] <sean`> NOT id's
[03:50:13] <quicksilver> this isn't my code, FFS
[03:50:30] <quicksilver> I'm just saying $("#a1") and $(a).filter('#a1') are very different.
[03:50:40] <quicksilver> $('#a1') always selects it - if it exists.
[03:50:51] <sean`> that's not the case I'm making
[03:50:55] <sean`> I totally agree on that
[03:50:56] <quicksilver> $(a).filter('#a1') only selects it if it was indeed in the set/selector a.
[03:50:59] <sean`> point*
[03:51:02] <quicksilver> good.
[03:51:04] <quicksilver> then this is stupid.
[03:51:09] <sean`> ?CC
[03:51:09] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[03:51:10] <quicksilver> let's stop arguing about things we both accept.
[03:51:17] <sean`> NO U
[03:51:39] <xec> bad day, sean`? :)
[03:51:57] <sean`> NO PERFECT, Y?

[04:07:22] <newman|2> Hi. I'm using jquery ui tabs. My elements are like <div><ul tabs list/></div><div id="tab-1" /><div="tab-2" />, i.e tabs content are not siblings of the ul list. Is it allowed to place the parts like this, or do they have to be next to eachother? Reason for asking is I get "Mismatching fragment identifier" when clicking in the list.
[04:07:55] <ryrych> "since JSONP and cross-domain GET requests do not use XHR, in those cases the (j)XHR and textStatus parameters passed to the success callback are undefined." Hm, so how can I get the response from a cross-domain?

[04:11:55] <v0lZy> Its a slideshow, if you click on it, it scrolls around .... I want but when you reach slide4 and it scrolls back to slide1, you can see the previous slides rush by as it rewinds. I want to fade them out so they arent there
[04:12:08] <v0lZy> but whatever i do, doesnt work
[04:12:51] <newman|2> Aamir: I don't think that page says much about code structure style or requirements. Thanks for answering though. My problem is that I'd like an overlay to be visible regardless of current tab. And that makes it a good place to put an tabs list. At least that's what I thought.
[04:14:32] <Aamir> newman|2:  use normal structure as used on jqUI site, urDiv.tabs() and than you can move the tabs to other div but urDiv.tabs('add',...) will not work
[04:15:13] <Aamir> newman|2:  ohh, clicking the tabs might not work...
[04:15:23] <fire> Hi, why can't i assign the ajax response to variable strContent? http://pastebin.com/1bbUgPPw
[04:15:32] <Aamir> newman|2: so i guess you have to use the Proper html structure :)
[04:16:11] <quicksilver> fire: because you don't understand asynchrony.
[04:16:21] <Aamir> fire: if ajax failed, success never executes
[04:16:26] <Aamir> fire: on onerror
[04:16:36] <quicksilver> fire: AJAX is asynchronous, which means that your function (loadStates) terminates *before* the ajax is called
[04:16:42] <quicksilver> fire: so the return strContent;
[04:16:42] <newman|2> Aamir: That's what I feared. I'll have to try and work around that part. Thanks again.
[04:16:49] <quicksilver> is returning the value before the request happens.
[04:16:52] <quicksilver> i.e. "".
[04:17:05] <fire> ah ok
[04:17:42] <fire> asynchronious means the function is not synchronious called with the ajax request
[04:17:50] <Aamir> fire:  opps i misread but still you will not error if ajax failed, use error: function(){..}
[04:18:31] <fire> i've already the error: function() in my global ajax setup
[04:18:54] <fire> how can i call this function to get the result of the ajax call
[04:22:50] <Zeddy> im completely brainfrozen atm. I'm generating a list of boxes, which all get different values and depending on the values the boxes get different states which are controlled by buttons within the boxes
[04:22:56] <Zeddy> whats the best way to generate this lol
[04:22:59] <mehale> hi there
[04:23:18] <mehale> is there a way to specify a date range or 1st & last date for jqueryui datepicker?
[04:23:46] <Cork> Zeddy: you could always do it through css
[04:23:59] <Cork> input[value=""] + button
[04:24:54] <Zeddy> also the values are updated every 5 seconds
[04:25:15] <Zeddy> so i basically need to update the text values without refreshing the whole box, because that would reset the currently selected state
[04:25:16] <Cork> if you style the button through css, that would be handled by the browser
[04:25:50] <fire> Aamir: How can i return the result of ajax request thrue the function
[04:25:54] <Cork> Zeddy: ah you mean more how to generate the html then how to style it?
[04:26:38] <Aamir> fire: Good question :D i usually use events :P
[04:26:42] <Cork> you could generate the html through the initial html rendering, then update it from an json array
[04:26:47] <Cork> Zeddy: ^
[04:26:54] <Zeddy> styling is not a problem, the whole logic behind generating and updating the html is getting kinda crazy
[04:26:56] <Zeddy> objects here and there
[04:27:08] <BlaDe> Can anyone help me with this: http://pastie.org/private/bjdlxryg9hpfmkhn7fn97g  -- ZeroClipboard said that it can't set zIndex or 'undefined'
[04:27:20] <fire> ok Aamir, thank you, i'll append the response to the html code within the success function
[04:27:25] <Aamir> fire: you can call another function in success :|
[04:27:26] <Zeddy> what i basically think would be the best method, is to have a container div for each box, and define variables and internal functions for that div
[04:27:41] <Cork> Zeddy: you could ex. select on the field name, and then use that as an object key, and just loop over it
[04:29:12] <v0lZy> Can somone look at this and please tell me why it goes berserk on the second click? http://jsfiddle.net/gpQaG/14/

[04:37:55] <v0lZy> this part.
[04:38:31] <v0lZy> Could this be because fadeOut is asynchronus and the if (moveSlideTo ... runs before its finished, and during the process, changes the variable?
[04:39:11] <Aamir> BlackArts:  the response of the request is empty

[05:20:49] <pallet> I'm doing the following prurl = 'http://www.domain.com/filename.php?cn='+jQuery('#con').val();
[05:21:39] <pallet> how do modify jQuery('#con').val(); so it's got the URL spaces included?
[05:21:59] <quicksilver> URL spaces included?
[05:22:03] <quicksilver> not sure what you mean
[05:22:33] <pallet> I think it's called URLencode
[05:22:37] <pallet> or something like
[05:22:49] <pallet> oyu know when spaces get turned to %20
[05:23:07] <quicksilver> encodeURI ?
[05:23:34] <pallet> that could be it
[05:23:49] <quicksilver> encodeURI("a b c")
[05:23:50] <quicksilver> "a%20b%20c"
[05:23:57] <quicksilver> that's just a plain javascript function
[05:23:59] <quicksilver> no jquery here :)
[05:24:07] <pallet> ok, that's the kidda, thanks
[05:24:43] <vontdeux> so..what's new in jquery 1.6?
[05:25:11] <vontdeux> adobe CS 5.5 will fully support jQuery!! yay!
[05:26:28] <pallet> quicksilver, thanks, that worked a treat
[05:27:15] <pallet> I know this is off topic, but does anyone know a library or something that I can use to make php output so it's all iphone friendly like

[05:40:06] <EdwardIII> hey
[05:44:00] <Zeddy> thedrive.containerr = $("<div>"+thedrive.id+"</div>");
[05:44:10] <Zeddy> how do i change the html inside this value?
[05:44:34] <Zeddy> if i do $('body').append(thedrive.containerr); and then try editing the html it doesn't quite work as i thoughtr
[05:44:53] <Zeddy> shouldn't $(thedrive.containerr).html("hello"); work? :\
[05:45:58] <Zeddy> what im trying to achieve here is to have divs connected to my objects and when performing updates on the objects i want to update the info within the divs connected to it
[05:46:07] <Zeddy> am i doing this all backward?
[05:52:53] <Zeddy> wtf
[05:54:22] <StevenBlack> Zeddy: Use $(thedrive.containerr).text("Hello")
[05:54:41] <StevenBlack> or $(thedrive.containerr).append( .... )
[05:55:28] <iivvoo> thedrive.containerr.html("hello") should work
[05:55:48] <iivvoo> it's already a selector, no need to wrap it in $() again
[05:56:06] <BlaDe> has anyone used ZeroClipboard?
[05:56:08] <StevenBlack> thedrive.containerr.append()  -- since thedrive.containerr is already a jQuery object.
[05:57:47] <Zeddy> i tried
[05:57:50] <Zeddy> but http://pastie.org/1926572 doesn't work
[05:57:54] <Zeddy> it doesn't update the content
[05:58:37] <__name__> Howdy.
[05:58:51] <jamov> Zeddy, your last line is missing $()
[05:59:06] <Zeddy> but its allready a selector :o
[05:59:10] <Zeddy> as iivvoo said
[05:59:18] <jamov> *shrug*
[05:59:38] <Zeddy> $(thedrive.containerr).html("hello"); doesn't help either
[06:00:07] <jamov> can you actually make this kind of selector? $("<div>"+thedrive.id+"</div>")
[06:00:20] <quicksilver> yes. that's how you create new bits of DOM
[06:00:40] <Zeddy> but whats wrong with the code :\
[06:01:03] <jamov> haven't seen that kind of selector used anywhere before.
[06:01:22] <jamov> oh well, carry on. obviously can't help.
[06:01:31] <Cork> Zeddy: it might be that we added .data directly on the creation
[06:01:41] <Cork> Zeddy: try puting that on its own line
[06:01:47] <Zeddy> nope, tried removing data
[06:01:51] <Cork> (i'm not sure if data returns the jquery object)
[06:02:05] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/1926587
[06:02:31] <quicksilver> Zeddy: it does work.
[06:02:43] <Zeddy> http://www.kokonniemi.fi/bussi2/#triplistPage
[06:02:48] <Zeddy> no it doesn't :p
[06:02:49] <quicksilver> Zeddy: http://jsfiddle.net/jQKkt/
[06:02:51] <quicksilver> yes, it does.
[06:02:56] <quicksilver> look at my jsfiddle.
[06:03:07] <quicksilver> the div gets appended and then changed to contain 'hello'
[06:03:15] <Cork> Zeddy: http://jsfiddle.net/UdzTp/
[06:03:24] <Cork> its something outside that code line that fails
[06:03:41] <Zeddy> hmm
[06:03:50] <__name__> Can I somehow cancel an ajax request?
[06:03:54] <__name__> I.e. just drop the connection.
[06:04:00] <Zeddy> well it works up untill $('.content').append(thedrive.containerr);
[06:04:03] <Cork> Zeddy: ex2: http://jsfiddle.net/UdzTp/1/
[06:04:45] <Cork> Zeddy: the code you pastebined worked
[06:04:54] <Cork> so i would say its something else that fails
[06:04:55] <Zeddy> wtf
[06:05:12] <Zeddy> but do you see anything on the page i linked that could even cause this abnormal behavior?
[06:05:21] <Zeddy> im not getting any console errors
[06:06:00] <nickshanks> i folks. I have a tree traversal question. i would like to select the first element matching a selector after my currently selected set of elements. perhaps something like $('h2').nextAll('table:first') ? which would give me an array containing the first table after each h2 element
[06:06:22] <Cork> Zeddy: donno and i got to run, my bus isn't waiting :)
[06:06:30] <nickshanks> i only thought of that as I was typing, will go try it
[06:06:46] <Zeddy> :P
[06:07:01] <quicksilver> nickshanks: it doesn't do what you want.
[06:07:13] <nickshanks> oh, ok
[06:07:16] <quicksilver> nickshanks: I think you can only do that with a manual .each() loop.
[06:07:29] <nickshanks> yes, i was thinking that might be necessary
[06:07:46] <quicksilver> well, try the nextAll() thing actually
[06:07:51] <quicksilver> I'm suddenly not sure.
[06:08:01] <quicksilver> I don't know if it's going to apply the 'first' globally, or to each h2 :)
[06:08:01] <nickshanks> what would you suggest if it doesn't work?
[06:08:34] <quicksilver> $('h2').each(function() { $(this).next('table:first); .. something ... } )
[06:08:52] <quicksilver> nextAll, not next.
[06:09:08] <SkiOne> how can I get all the values of a select into an array?
[06:09:50] <nickshanks> quicksilver: nextAll without each only selected the first on the page
[06:09:50] <SkiOne> but within the this context
[06:10:40] <quicksilver> nickshanks: that's what I feared, yes.
[06:10:53] <quicksilver> nickshanks: I believe you'll have to use the each.
[06:10:54] <nickshanks> this works: .each(function() { $(this).nextAll('table:first').css('border','5px solid red'); });
[06:10:56] <nickshanks> thanks!
[06:12:19] <quicksilver> nickshanks: or... $('h2').map(function(){return $(this).nextAll('table.first');}).css('border','5px solid red');
[06:12:34] <quicksilver> nickshanks: .map lets you 'return' things which build up a new selection for the next thing in the chain.
[06:12:36] <Zeddy> hey, check it out, it does update the dom element, but the dom element is not updated in the view?
[06:12:38] <Zeddy> http://www.kokonniemi.fi/bussi2/#triplistPage
[06:12:41] <Zeddy> check the console.log
[06:13:07] <Zeddy> click on one of the divs outputted
[06:13:17] <Zeddy> the new html is there, but its not update on the page itself
[06:13:18] <nickshanks> quicksilver: thanks! I had once read about that function in the docs, but have never used it
[06:13:56] <arpecop>  http://www.cl.ly/3r3m063h1j3K0j2q2z11 <- how to use jquery selector for marked(selected) area ?
[06:16:50] <Zeddy> its like the dom element is copied instead of referenced
[06:16:53] <Gambi> May somebody help me?
[06:16:53] <Zeddy> why does that happend
[06:16:53] <Gambi> http://jsfiddle.net/C3uKF/1/
[06:17:09] <Gambi> If you click Make TokenInput the inputfield should convert
[06:17:14] <nickshanks> quicksilver: tried map() but didn't work as you wrote it. checked docs, they appended .get() to the end, so tried that and it still didn't work. i will just use .each() instead :)
[06:17:33] <Gambi> but when you click again, the tokenInput should not reinitialize again
[06:17:54] <Gambi> how can i filter elements which are not tokenized?
[06:18:56] <Gambi> I've tried this
[06:18:56] <Gambi> http://jsfiddle.net/C3uKF/3/
[06:19:01] <Gambi> But it doesn't work
[06:19:50] <Zeddy> http://pastie.org/1926656 the first append works, the second doesn't, any explanations
[06:20:54] <quicksilver> nickshanks: yes, annoying that, it ends up as a nested jquery object. You instead need something like
[06:21:02] <quicksilver> nickshanks: or... $('h2').map(function(){return $(this).nextAll('table.first')[0];}).css('border','5px solid red');
[06:21:15] <quicksilver> nickshanks: (note the extra [0] to unwrap the inner ones)
[06:21:16] <nickshanks> oh, [0], okay
[06:21:52] <CPNL011> I have 3 lists where i use sortable with connectWith. I can "drag and drop" from 2 lists on the left side to one list on the other side.
[06:21:52] <CPNL011> Is there a possibility that jQuery knows from which list on the left side it came from ?
[06:25:50] <xvilka> how i can print all javascript object structure?
[06:26:35] <Zeddy> does anyone know why the first append works but the second doesn't? http://pastie.org/1926656
[06:26:35] <ec8or_> if i already got my target object as a var, how do i select in using jquery without using '#' + variable... i always end up doing this all the time but it seems a bit silly: http://pastebin.com/yLGiWd10
[06:26:56] <SkiOne> how can I get the id of the parent div with jquery?
[06:27:46] <Zeddy> http://pastebin.com/qer98zMg shouldn't this work ec8or_?
[06:27:54] <ec8or_> SkiOne: $(this).closest('div').attr('id');
[06:27:57] <maxdlx> SkiOne: $(this).parent("div").attr("id");
[06:27:58] <SkiOne> thanks
[06:28:00] <maxdlx> :D
[06:28:10] <ec8or_> yeah or that one ;)
[06:28:26] <Toidi> how come $('.packageTab').mouseenter(function(){ console.log('enter'); }); does not work
[06:28:34] <Zeddy> allright, so he got two answers and i got none? :p
[06:28:45] <Zeddy> i broke jQuery
[06:29:01] <SkiOne> Zeddy no
[06:29:17] <SkiOne> $(element).hide()
[06:30:27] <ec8or_> Zeddy: yeah but i'm not hiding the element that contained the id.. i got the id but can't select it without adding a #
[06:31:06] <ec8or_> Zeddy: $('.content').append($(thedrive.containerr)); that looks odd to me...
[06:31:30] <SkiOne> but isnt it the # that tells jquery you are looking for an id? as opposed to a class or an element?
[06:31:36] <ec8or_> what are you trying to append?
[06:32:04] <SkiOne> so # = id, . = class, nothing it would try to do for all elecments on the page(a, select, etc)
[06:32:14] <ec8or_> SkiOne: yeah it is, maybe i'll just have to add it. it is not a big issue.. just doesn't seem where elegant
[06:32:53] <SkiOne> its jquery shorthand, otherwise you would have to do things like getElementbyId or name
[06:32:58] <ec8or_> SkiOne: like i always have things like <a href="" rel="Image_65">click</a>
[06:33:08] <SkiOne> so its 1 character as opposed to a whole method name
[06:33:42] * SkiOne btw still a jquery noob
[06:34:27] <Zeddy> <ec8or_> what are you trying to append? <- im just trying to append something else then what is set
[06:35:06] <ec8or_> Zeddy: yeah i don't think you can append a jquery selector.. so your js would break and then "2" is not appended either
[06:35:29] <ec8or_> or like that selector wouldn't work really
[06:36:11] <anli_> Can I check if two jquery objects refer to the same html element?
[06:36:26] <Zeddy> uhm but how do i create a div which will be used to represent the data contained in my object?
[06:36:31] <Zeddy> whats the best way then?
[06:36:48] <anli_> Hm, maybe I chould obj1.get(0) == obj2.get(0) ?
[06:36:53] <Zeddy> because i will be updating its content every 5 seconds with new data fetched with ajax
[06:37:54] <vontdeux> use $('#somediv').html(your_content_var); then
[06:38:12] <vontdeux> your_content_var should come from ajax response
[06:38:37] * anli_ has started to only use ajax for dynamic content
[06:38:44] <SkiOne> would load be better for putting content into a div? or append?
[06:39:18] <Zeddy> but i cant just replace the div content with what i fetch from ajax
[06:39:28] <nickshanks> my 'table:first' selector looks like a first element in the table namespace :/
[06:39:35] <Zeddy> because the divs will have different states and just replacing the data would reset the state
[06:39:42] <vontdeux> it will be replaced if you use .html(yourvar);
[06:39:49] <anli_> Can I get rid of the spell checker in firefox using some markup or css?
[06:40:04] <vontdeux> different state?
[06:40:31] <Zeddy> each container will have 3 states which the user can switch by clicking on buttons within the container
[06:41:22] <Zeddy> the two boxes on this page: http://www.kokonniemi.fi/bussi2/#triplistPage represent state 1 and state 2 of the box, the idea is to have it all in the same box and let the user switch state using the arrows
[06:42:12] <Zeddy> and if the user has manualle switched to state 2, i want to update the content of state 1 and state 2 without display the default state (being state 1)
[06:42:52] <ec8or_> Zeddy: create 3 different divs and cycle the visibility?
[06:43:14] <vontdeux> 3 dif div, 3 div ajax handler too
[06:43:16] <Zeddy> yes well i am basically doing that, im just storing the html of each div inside the object
[06:43:54] <vontdeux> that way you can copy the html from 1, to 2 and vise versa
[06:43:54] <Zeddy> but if im unable to link a specific div to a object, i wont be able to update the currently visible state :o
[06:44:10] <vontdeux> you need to read about .live() then
[06:44:12] <djQuery> SkiOne: load if the info can just be dumped in. or if you need to massage it first AND then append it
[06:44:26] <Zeddy> i know about live()
[06:44:53] <Zeddy> but i dont want to give each box its own ID :F
[06:45:15] <ec8or_> Zeddy: why not? :)
[06:45:19] <pallet> quick question
[06:45:28] <pallet>    function listchecknum(thingy) {
[06:45:28] <pallet>    prurl = encodeURI('http://www.purchaseseal.com/pre/exGetCompanyInformation.php?cn='+thingy);
[06:46:16] <xec> good question
[06:46:27] <ec8or_> i'd say no
[06:46:32] <pallet> when the variable thingy is passed, it has a 0 at the start, but by the  time it gets to the function the 0 has gone
[06:46:40] <Zeddy> well, for each bus, i would have to first find its containing div using the ID, thats ok, but then i would have to go through each single text box, update it, and find its child arrows, and check if they have something to point to, otherwise disable them, and also change the class of one of the divs to change the color
[06:46:51] <pallet> how do I make sure it's handled as a var, not a number?
[06:46:52] <Zeddy> it would be an insane amount of looping through dom elements
[06:47:12] <xec> pallet: you mean string?
[06:47:16] <pallet> yeh
[06:47:24] <pallet> I'm a newbie to all this business
[06:47:32] <SkiOne> how can you destroy a div and everythine inside?
[06:47:44] <xec> pallet: var test = "0001"; is a string
[06:48:16] <dxgriffiths> SkiOne: $(thediv).remove()
[06:48:26] <Toidi> should $('#img').attr('src', '/path/to/new/image.png'); work?
[06:48:30] <xec> pallet: did that answer your question?
[06:48:45] <Toidi> My image just vanishes when I use the aboe
[06:49:08] <SkiOne> thanks
[06:49:27] <pallet> xec,   echo '<td id="compnum"><a href="#" onclick="listchecknum('.$companynumber.');">'.$companynumber.'</a></td>'; I know I'm using an onclick and shouldn't and I know bit is php
[06:49:40] <ec8or_> Zeddy: i don't really get it... you only have to loop through stuff when you click the arrows no? or is there updates every minute that would change the colors of the boxes etc?
[06:49:55] <pallet> but at that point the var is being displayed with a 0
[06:49:58] <pallet> at the start
[06:50:13] <Zeddy> ec8or_, theres updates every 5 seconds
[06:50:28] <anli_> Is there a way to use <input type="file"> with ajax?
[06:50:29] <Zeddy> which could change the colors, but most likely will only change the amount of minutes left
[06:50:37] <anli_> I want to upload a file without getting a new page
[06:50:55] <xec> pallet: what does listchecknum(); do?
[06:51:19] <quicksilver> anli_: google jquery ajax file upload, there are several.
[06:51:30] <Zeddy> but my idea was, to fetch the new data for each state using ajax, and update the currently visible states data, and when the user clicks one of the arrows, generate the new state based on the data which was fetched
[06:51:50] <Zeddy> *and update the currently visible states dom
[06:51:56] <xec> pallet: does it take number or string as argument? and what does $companynumber contain? an int?
[06:52:23] <dxgriffiths> Toidi: It ought to.
[06:53:05] <Zeddy> but i guess that i could give each container a specific ID, and when the new data is fetched for each container, and when i get a list of new data for each div i would loop through the list and for each element in that list lookup its div and change all the elements within that div
[06:53:20] <dxgriffiths> Toidi: http://www.anyexample.com/webdev/javascript/jquery_change_image.xml
[06:53:42] <xec> pallet: im gonna take a wild guess here; onclick="listchecknum(\''.$companynumber.'\');"
[06:54:45] <anli_> All I get from an <input type="file"> if I do $('input').val() is the choosen filename
[06:54:59] <ec8or_> Zeddy: if you don't want to traverse the tree all the time you can probably just style the driveInnerContainer based on the minutes remaning
[06:55:06] <ec8or_> and float the arrows on top
[06:55:20] <ec8or_> although you need to disable them right?
[06:55:45] <Zeddy> the arrows might sometimes be hidden
[06:57:55] <pallet> xec, thanks
[06:58:00] <pallet> I'm outta here
[06:58:46] * xec feels used
[06:59:07] * dxgriffiths pats xec on the back
[06:59:32] * xec coughs up some blood
[06:59:43] <dxgriffiths> gross lol
[07:01:06] <xec> hehe, im sorry, its not easy being nice to me
[07:03:07] <Zxurian> for my own edification, which should I be using, option 1, or option 2? - http://pastebin.com/FdYRh9VC
[07:04:59] <JeffJassky> hey, guys. I'm using the jQuery UI droppable plugin and the "greedy:true" setting doesn't seem to be working. Drops are propagating up to the top level of my nested list instead of being dropped on the child droppable. I was wondering if anyone's had experience with this and might have any pointers.
[07:05:50] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: depends on how often you call the function and whether the div itself is likely to be replaced later on.
[07:06:10] <dxgriffiths> If the div is static for the lifetime of the page and you call the function more than once, then option 1 is more efficient.
[07:06:16] <dxgriffiths> Sorry, 2.
[07:06:23] <dxgriffiths> Otherwise just use 1.
[07:07:39] <EdwardIII> hrm i'm having some trouble with the jquery tabs UI stuff: https://gist.github.com/980822
[07:12:00] <Zxurian> thanks dxg, just checking
[07:12:08] <dxgriffiths> np
[07:12:10] <EdwardIII> it's basically not going tabby
[07:12:39] <Zxurian> so if the functions is likely to be called several times on a page (due to interaction with various elements), i'm better off assigning the object to a variable first thing, so jQuery doesn't have to continuously re-look it up each time the function fires, right?
[07:13:11] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: right.
[07:13:18] <Zxurian> dxg: thankx
[07:13:57] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: just make sure it's done after the DOM is ready, otherwise it might not work.
[07:14:47] <Zxurian> well I would put them into $(document).ready(), isn't that what it's for?
[07:15:17] <dxgriffiths> Right.
[07:16:32] <Zxurian> follow up question, if I wanted to apply a click event to two objects, say $("#foo, #bar").click(), is there something I can do that's equivilant to that if foo = $("#foo") & bar = $("#bar") without having to call foo.click() separate from bar.click() ?
[07:17:17] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: can you rephrase?
[07:18:14] <Zxurian> let's say I wanted to apply the same click event to two different DOM elements, normally I'd just do $("#foo, #bar").click(function(){ doSomething(); })
[07:19:01] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: k, so what do you want to do now?
[07:19:21] <Zxurian> but using option 2 described above, and I had $("#foo") assigned to the var "foo", and $("#bar") assigned to the var "bar", is there a way to assign the same click event to both of them at the same time, or would I ahve to do it separately using their respective var names?
[07:20:35] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: Oh right. Yeah in that case you would, but since it's only being done once then I'd say just use the original method. That one extra lookup isn't going to kill anyone.
[07:21:22] <jeffsmykil> $("#unitNumber").val(this);  that returns [object HTMLInputElement]
[07:21:36] <gabWNT> is there anyway to disable elements inside a select from being selected?
[07:21:53] <Zxurian> okay, thanks
[07:21:54] <Vaerros> gabWNT: disabeled attribute
[07:21:57] <Zxurian> appreciate the input
[07:21:58] <Vaerros> disabled*
[07:22:13] <Vaerros> or property, via jquery
[07:22:14] <gabWNT> i dont mean to the select
[07:22:20] <gabWNT> but to certain elements inside of it
[07:22:25] <Vaerros> I know
[07:22:36] <gabWNT> ok ty
[07:23:00] <crimlo> where the hoes at?
[07:23:09] <Vaerros> <option disabled='disabled'>I'm disabled</option> in markup or something like $('option.disableMe').prop('disabled', true) in jquery
[07:23:21] <gabWNT> is that crossbrowser compliant?
[07:23:36] <Vaerros> as far as the markup, yes
[07:23:40] <gabWNT> ok ty
[07:23:47] <jeffsmykil> can i not use this inside of val?
[07:24:27] <crimlo> I ASKED WHERE THE HOES WAS AT?
[07:24:59] <dxgriffiths> Zxurian: try $([foo, bar]).click though, just in case.
[07:25:16] <jeffsmykil> $("#unitNumber").val($(this));
[07:25:23] <jeffsmykil> gives me object object
[07:26:02] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: That's right.
[07:26:28] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: $(this) will be a jQuery object.
[07:26:42] <freshmilk> has anyone ever had a problem with jquery ui rendering labels twice?
[07:27:16] <Michael> I have not.
[07:27:59] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: it should be returing a value of the input though
[07:28:01] <jeffsmykil> and its not
[07:28:31] <freshmilk> check it out, its creating nested spans .. http://pastie.org/1926906
[07:29:26] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: If you're trying to get the value of #unitNumber, it'd just be $("#unitNumber").val()
[07:29:47] <jeffsmykil> oh wait
[07:29:53] <jeffsmykil> no im trying to put the value of this
[07:29:58] <freshmilk> oh wait, i thnk it's my ruby code doing this
[07:29:58] <jeffsmykil> inside of unitnumber
[07:30:31] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: I'm putting the value of $(this) inside of #unitNumber
[07:30:39] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: Ok cool, well if this is an input element then it'd be more like $("#unitNumber").val(this.value)
[07:30:55] <Ely^> Hi: http://jsfiddle.net/gKt57/ .. i need to disable the textbox on checking the checkbox, but when unchecked i need to enable it.. disable works
[07:31:00] <Ely^> how can i enable the textbox back?
[07:31:47] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: but this isn't a jquery object
[07:31:53] <Michael> freshmilk, Is having a span inside a label valid?
[07:32:07] <Michael> I've never done that.
[07:32:26] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: That's right. An HTMLInputText object will have a .value property.
[07:32:34] <ele> i've got an form with an submit handler attached to it, but this form has multiple submit buttons. Is there any way to find out which button was pressed?
[07:33:02] <jeffsmykil> huh it works, not quite sure why i didnt need to make it an object, but ill take it
[07:33:04] <jeffsmykil> thanks dx
[07:33:06] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths:
[07:33:37] <freshmilk> Michael: that's how jquery ui does it.
[07:33:43] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: It's because "this" is already the input object in the page. You could also say $(this).val() but it's wasteful.
[07:33:43] <freshmilk> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[07:33:46] <Michael> Eeeenteresting
[07:33:59] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: cool thanks
[07:34:05] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: np.
[07:34:21] <jeffsmykil> you are a gentlemen and a scholar dxgriffiths ! ;)
[07:35:01] <Michael> freshmilk, The code on that page does not have span elements inside of label
[07:35:03] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: :) I hang out in #jsmentors as well, in case you ever need other info.
[07:35:13] <jeffsmykil> there is a jsmentors?
[07:35:16] <jeffsmykil> OMG
[07:35:17] <Michael> Or it lies
[07:35:24] <jeffsmykil> thats exactly what i need
[07:35:30] <freshmilk> your talking about the code under view source
[07:35:32] <freshmilk> ?
[07:35:36] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: drop in! :)
[07:35:39] <Michael> yeah
[07:36:00] <jeffsmykil> its not creepy is it?
[07:36:07] <dxgriffiths> lol
[07:36:15] <freshmilk> that's what you pass in. jquery ui hides the inputs and replaces them with spans and adds lots of classes here and there
[07:36:31] <Michael> yeah sorry, too many distractions inside my head.
[07:36:52] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: I doubt it.
[07:37:20] <jeffsmykil> as long as i dont have to dress up like a baby or something
[07:37:30] <dxgriffiths> jeffsmykil: It's optional.
[07:39:04] <MatthiasVance> So, I replace an element with an iframe, now I need to be able to set the contents etc, and have a few questions: 1) Is there a ready() like event for (i)frames? 2) How should I set the "contents"?
[07:39:22] <sarkis> hey guys, any good resources on callbacks?
[07:39:23] <MatthiasVance> Previously I was using my own getFrameDocument() that gets the right document element, and then just using innerHTML.
[07:39:40] <sarkis> i want to properly do stuff with the data returned by $.get()
[07:40:13] <JeffJassky> I'm using the jQuery UI droppable plugin and the "greedy:true" setting doesn't seem to be working. Drops are propagating up to the top level of my nested list instead of being dropped on the child droppable.
[07:40:14] <JeffJassky>  I was wondering if anyone's had experience with this and might have any pointers.
[07:40:57] <Zxurian> so I tried your example dxg, http://jsfiddle.net/pWJgp/ , but doesn't look like that works
[07:41:12] <Zxurian> if I remove the square brackets, then foo does get changed, but bar stays the same
[07:48:12] <Zeddy> hmm, is it bad practice to use an array and start off by storing values for keys much larger then zero?
[07:48:21] <Zeddy> like myArray[1337] = myobject;
[07:48:35] <Zeddy> for some reason this sets everything between 0 and 1337 to undefined
[07:48:47] <Zeddy> and .each() loops through all the undefined pairs aswell
[07:49:06] <Michael> Zeddy, that's leet
[07:49:25] <Zeddy> yeah, tell me about it. :p
[07:49:50] <Zeddy> but the thing is, when doing an ajax fetch i want to create new values but if there are old values in my list with the same ID, i only want to update them
[07:50:10] <hejsan> Hi, i acctually dont know if this is the right channel, but is anyone familar with the "Nivo slider" ? I have som issues and cant get the slider to work.. Thanks /hejsan
[07:50:14] <Zeddy> im trying to figure out the best way to lookup the exisiting values when i want to update and i figure it would have been easiest to set the identifier as the key
[07:52:43] <symtab> hi
[07:53:01] <symtab> i have inputs like name="numberhere[convert]"
[07:53:13] <symtab> how can i change the value for the inputs of the above form from jquery?
[07:54:12] <quicksilver> something like $('[name$="[convert]"]')
[07:55:20] <MatthiasVance> Argh! Apparently a new/empty iframe is "on another domain"? :)
[07:55:30] <MatthiasVance> Let's see if I get any errors.
[07:56:21] <MatthiasVance> Nope, probably just doing something wrong.
[07:57:41] <Zeddy> seriously why does .each() loop through undefined values?
[07:57:45] <Zeddy> that makes no sense
[07:57:53] <Zeddy> it should loop through defined key-value pairs >-<
[08:01:45] <ahandy> hey guys, question. can i access ui.value of a slider outside the slider's function? like if i want to have a next/previous arrow next to the scrollbar
[08:01:57] <fist> hey, the expression ui.item.html() delivers: http://pastebin.com/H1myasND .. now i would like to get the <input> field from the first expression; $("input", ui.item.html()).size() delivers "0"
[08:02:55] <fist> okay i see the error :/
[08:03:58] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Can you quickly recap what you're trying to do?
[08:04:00] <mustefaj> i have some dom elements that are dynamically loaded, and i want to add classes to them, so i can't do it on page load because they don't yet exist, do i need to wrap the add Class around something that says "when this dom element is loaded, add the class"
[08:04:16] <MatthiasVance> mustefaj: Just do it in the callback?
[08:04:26] <mustefaj> What is that, sorry i dont know
[08:04:45] <MatthiasVance> mustefaj: When you're doing your Ajax call (with jQuery), you just add the classes in the success callback.
[08:04:49] <mustefaj> btw, the dom elements are added in one script, and the addClass in another
[08:04:59] <MatthiasVance> Oh.
[08:05:03] <mustefaj> i need them separate
[08:05:15] <mustefaj> i was thinking i can wrap it in a function
[08:05:27] <mustefaj> some kind of .live( bla bla bla)
[08:05:50] <mustefaj> $("dynamic dom element").live ( function () { addClass here }
[08:06:04] <jeffsmykil> dxgriffiths: you still there?
[08:06:09] <Zeddy> MatthiasVance, im fetching a list of vehicles in motion, their coordinates and estimated arrival times. and each ajax call(happends every fifth second or so) can contain new drives, but also new data for drives allready listed, i want to quickly find the objects corresponding to the old drives and update the data for these objects, if the object with the same ID does not exist i create a new
[08:06:10] <Zeddy> one
[08:06:32] <Zeddy> the problem is i cannot store the objects in an array like myDriveArray[driveID] = someObject
[08:06:39] <Zeddy> because driveID can be 13575
[08:06:57] <Zeddy> and to loop through the whole array i would have to go through atleast 13575 undefined array elements
[08:07:04] <Krinkle> ?live @ mustefaj
[08:07:04] <bot-t> mustefaj, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:07:06] <Zeddy> which i guess might slow down the page a bit
[08:07:17] <mustefaj> Krinkle? sorry ?
[08:07:20] <jeffsmykil> /join #jsmentors
[08:07:32] <jeffsmykil> oops
[08:07:42] <mustefaj> ;)
[08:07:50] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: You could just set the id of the element in question to drive_<ID>
[08:07:58] <MatthiasVance> Then using jQuery see if it's already there.
[08:08:03] <Kronuz> hello
[08:08:08] <Zeddy> MatthiasVance, then i would have to loop through the whole damn array
[08:08:10] <Zeddy> and check the ID
[08:08:21] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: You have to do that anyway.
[08:08:24] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: One way or the other.
[08:08:52] <Zeddy> :S why it would be so much easier to just do myDriveArray[someID].eta = newEta;
[08:08:52] <Kronuz> hey, is `!a in my_array` the same as `(!a) in my_array` or `!(a in my_array)` ?
[08:08:54] <ec8or_> Zeddy: if you want to potentially update all the drives you have to check them all right?
[08:09:09] <ec8or_> Zeddy: but you should solve that in the backend - just return updated drives in the ajax response
[08:09:24] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: I have another idea! Just create a "class" for each drive, then push them to an array.
[08:09:32] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: So, do not use the drive id as the key anymore.
[08:09:42] <Zeddy> but now say my ajax returns 5 drives, and i currently have 3 listed, that would kinda force me to check 15 different ID's
[08:10:14] <Zeddy> ec8or_, i also want to return new drives
[08:10:19] <Zeddy> all data will always be updated
[08:10:26] <MatthiasVance> Someone somewhere is going to have to loop that amount anyway, Zeddy, that's not going to change. :)
[08:10:45] <MatthiasVance> Perhaps a better idea is this:
[08:10:53] <yekta> In order to keep the print dialog box appearing from a "window.print" I can go into the about:config of FF and add print.always_print_silent boolean, is there a javascript/jquery way to do that?
[08:11:02] <Zeddy> so ur saying that looping through 15 values is as fast as just calling myArray[538] ?
[08:11:11] <ec8or_> Zeddy: why 15 id's? check if #Drive_ID exist and if not append it to the appropiate bus line?
[08:11:21] <MatthiasVance> ^
[08:12:20] <Zeddy> ec8or_, say my ajax returns 5 driveID's, and i have 3 currently listed, for each driveID returned i have to loop through the currently listed driveIDs to find the correct object
[08:12:29] <Zeddy> in the worst case that would cause 15 loops :p
[08:12:33] <yonkeltron> anyone have a personal favorite data grid plugin? particularly one with dynamic select input types. thought i'd ask here before trying out a billion of them
[08:13:06] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: You don't have to compare EACH id, you can just do document.getElementById()
[08:13:09] <MatthiasVance> *use
[08:13:11] <Zeddy> no
[08:13:15] <Zeddy> im not talking about DOM's :o
[08:13:20] <Zeddy> im talking about objects
[08:13:32] <Zeddy> i need to update the data stored in the objects, and after that update the DOM
[08:13:38] <jeffsmykil> im talking about vasssssssssooooline
[08:13:39] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Oh! Then I stand by my previous point: Someplace sometime someone has to do a lookup somewhere.
[08:13:51] <supercabbage_uk> Does anybody know if it's possible to hide all form elements after a specific element?
[08:14:09] <supercabbage_uk> something like $('#form select:after').hide();
[08:14:23] <jeffsmykil> supercabbage_uk: maybe .next?
[08:14:28] <Zeddy> the ideal situation would be: fetch ajax -> update the data to all existing objects with matching ID's, then add the new ones, then repaint the DOM elements to match the data in the objects
[08:14:30] <jeffsmykil> .next().hide()
[08:14:58] <Zeddy> would it be just easier to create an Object :F
[08:15:01] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Actually, why aren't you just discarding the old objects, instead of updating?
[08:15:12] <Zeddy> var driveArray = new Object(); driveArray.523 = driveObject();
[08:15:39] <Zeddy> then i could just updated the eta time for that object using driveArray.523.eta = 45
[08:15:45] <ec8or_> Zeddy: i dont understand why you can't just do this: if ($("#Drive_ID").length > 0) { update } else { create new }
[08:16:10] <MatthiasVance> ec8or_: He's not talking about the DOM yet.
[08:16:11] <Zeddy> MatthiasVance, because the objects contain states which are user generated which i dont want to change
[08:16:32] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Fair enough, then I don't see why you don't directly translate your results to the DOM, instead of having an intermediate step.
[08:16:39] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: This would save you a lot of work.
[08:17:07] <Zeddy> ec8or_, i dont see how i can access the object using that
[08:17:32] <mustefaj> MatthiasVance: can i use .load?
[08:17:42] <Zeddy> MatthiasVance, because using the object im generating 3 different views with their own dom elements
[08:17:52] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Ah, that explains.
[08:18:00] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Well, then your way might work!
[08:18:19] <MatthiasVance> The o.drive_xxx method.
[08:18:33] <Zeddy> so it is possible to use an object and define properties using digits like myObject.523 = mySubObject; ?
[08:19:04] <Zeddy> then again.. i cant loop through an objects properties -_-
[08:19:54] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Why can't you?
[08:19:56] <MatthiasVance> Sure you can!
[08:20:49] <Zeddy> ok, ill try that :p
[08:21:11] <mustefaj> is there a jquery function equivlent to prototypes .observe, that will observe changes to the dom and allow me to run code if true
[08:22:00] <Zeddy> lmao, my each started working as soon as i change new Array() to new Object();
[08:22:05] <MatthiasVance> Zeddy: Perhaps you have to filter stuff already there, but that's relatively easy if you decide on an argument name for your drive ids.
[08:23:14] <Zeddy> i thought that when fetching my new drives, if any of the old driveID's are not present i delete them from my list, and add drives which are not currently in the list, and the remaining ones i will update with new data
[08:23:49] <Zeddy> the hard part here is the 3 different states i have, since if a user is looking at state 2, i dont want my 5 sec interval to reset the user to state 1 once fresh data is there
[08:24:01] <Zeddy> but i still want to update all the data in each state
[08:24:31] <subsume> Could someone help me with this? http://dpaste.com/544267/
[08:28:50] <_ramo> hi
[08:29:10] <_ramo> why am i not getting any alerts here: http://privatepaste.com/b9aada6a44/afj5645k ?
[08:31:21] <Rafalski> hey guys, could someone help me out.. i have a problem with a check_box https://gist.github.com/981027
[08:34:40] <Zeddy> shit
[08:34:58] <Zeddy> if i have set myCars.523; and have var id= 523; how do i call that? :D
[08:35:09] <Zeddy> im guessing myCars.id wont work?
[08:35:26] <Manaus> hello, I need to call a jquery function before page completion, how can I?
[08:35:33] <ajpiano> Zeddy: bracket notation
[08:35:47] <ajpiano> Zeddy: myCars[id]
[08:38:05] <mustefaj> ajpiano, or anyone else, how can i run any jquery on a dynamically loaded element from  a script separate from the one that adds that element
[08:39:47] <verify> 'lo?
[08:39:51] <verify> oops
[08:40:12] <solsTiCe> hi. I am implemtinga zimple lazy loading like http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/load-content-while-scrolling-with-jquery/ but my data are appended twice when I hit the bottom of the page :-(
[08:40:39] <Connorhd> mustefaj: what do you mean by run any jquery? maybe give a solid example?
[08:41:57] <mustefaj> i have a list that's loaded dynamically using jquery + ajax, on a separate script, i'm adding a class to the 2nd item in that list, and want to bind events to that class
[08:42:02] <solsTiCe> my code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/391868
[08:42:03] <mustefaj> Connorhd ^^
[08:42:32] <Connorhd> mustefaj: http://api.jquery.com/live
[08:43:07] <mustefaj> Connorhd: I can't use addClass there tho
[08:43:16] <mustefaj> i can bind events to it if i can add the class
[08:43:47] <Zeddy> http://www.kokonniemi.fi/bussi2/#triplistPage
[08:43:47] <Zeddy> phew
[08:43:49] <GreyTrilbyIRC> ah - that's better
[08:43:53] <GreyTrilbyIRC> afternoon all
[08:43:55] <Zeddy> now i just need to get it to update using ajax
[08:43:56] <Zeddy> :D
[08:43:57] <Connorhd> can you not use a more complex css selector mustefaj ?
[08:44:09] <mustefaj> what do you mean Connorhd?
[08:44:21] <mustefaj> the selector itself works, if i do it in firebug console
[08:44:34] <mustefaj> but not from my other script
[08:44:34] <Ely^> any idea how I can get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/gKt57/1/   - checkbox check uncheck disable input before it.
[08:44:53] <Connorhd> mustefaj: for example $("ul li:nth-child(2)")... will select the 2nd item in a list
[08:45:04] <mustefaj> that's right
[08:45:12] <mustefaj> and that works in my firebug console
[08:45:15] <mustefaj> but not in my script
[08:45:48] <Connorhd> I'm not sure why then
[08:46:00] <GreyTrilbyIRC> logic question: i have an input box which, on keyup, sends a query via ajax to a php script to return & echo results. How can I make jquery work within that box to make it close on clicking a result? I've tried adding a script to the top of the page, but it doesn't do anything
[08:46:00] <mustefaj> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[08:46:46] <subsume> Could someone help me with this selector problem? http://dpaste.com/544267/
[08:47:11] <GreyTrilbyIRC> ah... will try that
[08:47:26] <Connorhd> mustefaj: thats what I said before, you can use live if you want to bind on things while are added to the page dynamically later
[08:47:44] <mustefaj> i'm having trouble with addClass on those
[08:47:56] <mustefaj> so i do .live(function () { addClass } to no dice
[08:48:42] <Connorhd> mustefaj: thats not how live works, it is for binding events
[08:48:57] <mustefaj> thats right
[08:49:07] <mustefaj> which brings me back to being able to addClass to dynamically loaded events
[08:49:16] <Connorhd> addClass isn't an event
[08:49:17] <mustefaj> which is why i said .live doesnt fix my probss
[08:49:31] <mustefaj> i didn't say it was
[08:49:35] <Cork[home]> subsume: simply put, you can't, not with a selector
[08:49:46] <Manaus> $(document).ready and $(window).load aren't the same?
[08:49:55] <subsume> Cork[home] righto.
[08:49:57] <bot-t> mustefaj, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[08:50:05] <Cork[home]> subsume: you can do it with a series of jquery calls though
[08:50:15] <subsume> What does that approach look like?
[08:50:21] <mustefaj> thanks bot-t, i was hoping there's a non-plugin way to do it
[08:50:39] <Cork[home]> subsume: $('#six').parent().nextAll('.inactive')
[08:50:56] <subsume> yeah, that's pretty perfect actually
[08:51:03] <subsume> I will try it, thanks.
[08:51:07] <Cork[home]> np
[08:52:21] <abaddon> hi, if i have 2 .click handlers shouldnt code like this click(function(event){ event.stopPropagation();  running first, stop the second click handler from running?
[08:53:15] <imsky> ?zalgo
[08:53:16] <bot-t> HE COMETH
[08:54:21] <abaddon> i found this instead and it worked event.stopImmediatePropagation();
[08:56:06] <bartmax> hi ajpiano and everyone!! long time no see
[08:58:26] <ch3mical> How do you dynamically set the selected option of a select box?
[08:58:52] <imsky> $("select").val("thing")
[08:58:56] <ch3mical> Simply setting the selected property doesn't seems to change it
[09:00:17] <freshmilk> can anyone explain this? http://pastie.org/1927301
[09:01:48] <imsky> i can explain it for a fee
[09:01:54] <ch3mical> Ah, there it goes. I was doing 'input[name="myselect"]' rather than 'select[name="myselect"]'
[09:01:55] <ch3mical> durr
[09:02:07] <imsky> good job bud
[09:02:11] <ch3mical> :D
[09:02:17] <ch3mical> It's early T_T
[09:02:25] <imsky> it's literally noon here
[09:02:30] <imsky> early was like 6 hours ago
[09:02:33] <ch3mical> 9 AM
[09:02:39] <ch3mical> I just woke up too
[09:02:41] <Kambfhase> 6PM
[09:02:48] <imsky> amazon just paid me
[09:02:49] <imsky> aw yeaa
[09:03:14] <Kambfhase> imsky: what for? did you send amazon a book?
[09:03:25] <imsky> for helping amazon out
[09:03:29] <imsky> with their...sales >_>
[09:04:04] <SEJeff_work> Is there a way to use fadeToggle / fadeIn / fadeOut but instead of them setting display: none, setting: visibility: hidden
[09:04:23] <imsky> SEJeff_work: yes, do it with animate()
[09:04:27] <jon__> what can I do to correct the fact that line-height vertically centers the text but not the div element?
[09:04:31] <SEJeff_work> imsky, Thanks
[09:04:36] <imsky> SEJeff_work: yw buddy
[09:05:10] <imsky> jon__: you are doing it wrong
[09:05:19] <imsky> also this is #jquery lol
[09:05:24] <Kambfhase> jon__: div is a block element. it alwys tries to use up as much space as possible
[09:05:30] <jon__> hehe I used jqcorners:D
[09:05:35] <imsky> lol wat
[09:05:39] <imsky> border-radius is in the house
[09:06:12] <jon__> kambfhase: ok, so I need to correct the div element and get rid of the line-height
[09:06:47] <imsky> ...you're still doing it wrong
[09:06:53] <Kambfhase> I dunno, #css is a fucker. but there might be a ben almen plugin for that!
[09:07:00] <imsky> $.unfuckCss()
[09:07:08] <sero|work> lol
[09:07:45] <m_e> is there a way to get all tables with a width of 600 something.... (>= 600 and < 700) <table width="6xx">
[09:08:05] <jon__> hrmm give it a shot
[09:08:11] <imsky> m_e: lol wat
[09:08:27] <Kambfhase> the best way to unfuck CSS ist to localize it. i mean, width and height the times is misspelled them are uncountable.
[09:08:28] <Ely^> anybody has knowledge about javascript and partial postbacks which break javascript?
[09:08:38] <imsky> this is not #asp-crap
[09:08:55] <Ely^> this involves JS aswell
[09:09:04] <imsky> yes, so take your question to ##javascript
[09:09:27] <Altreus> Is there an easy way of checking whether an element has one or more of several classes assigned, other than looping over them and using hasClass?
[09:09:34] <m_e> i want to select all tables that have the attribute width = 600 or greater.... 6xx ... 611... 634... 604... etc.
[09:09:40] <m_e> just 600 + something
[09:09:41] <imsky> m_e: why
[09:10:27] <m_e> because i need to find some information on a html file that has tables with a with greater than 600 and smaller than 700
[09:10:33] <m_e> and i want to get all these tables
[09:10:45] <m_e> *width
[09:10:49] <imsky> lololol
[09:10:58] <imsky> you are a funny man, mr. bond
[09:11:30] <m_e> very funny...
[09:11:56] <Kambfhase> m_e: you could get all tables and filter them by width
[09:11:57] <imsky> well that sounds like a lot of work, but i'll do it
[09:12:36] <imsky> pm me if you wanna continue m_e
[09:13:51] <m_e> Kambfhase: well ill try that thanks
[09:13:58] <m_e> imsky: no need to but thanks
[09:14:09] <imsky> ok good luck bud
[09:14:55] <dxgriffiths> freshmilk: What about it?
[09:16:53] <Kambfhase> $("table").filter(function(){ return ~~(/^(\d*)/.exec( $(this).width())[1]) >= 600 })
[09:17:10] <Kambfhase> m_e
[09:17:31] <imsky> Kambfhase: what's your day job?
[09:18:13] <Kambfhase> job?
[09:18:17] <imsky> gotcha
[09:18:37] <Randull> hi #jquery folks
[09:18:43] <imsky> sup Randull
[09:19:43] <Rafalski> hey guys, why wouldn't the success function fire off in here? https://gist.github.com/981027 the ajax call works, updates the DB and all, but inside the success code doesn't run?
[09:19:47] <freshmilk> dxgriffiths: why is it creating two spans? <span class="ui-button-text"><span class="ui-button-text">Web</span></span>
[09:19:49] <Randull> trying to get my day moving, how ar eyou doing imsky?
[09:19:56] <imsky> Randull: working hard ;)
[09:20:09] <Randull> :D
[09:20:34] <Randull> I figured I've beat my head against my issue on my own long enough and I might try finding a lil help in here
[09:20:40] <Kambfhase> Rafalski: are you sure your dataType is script?
[09:20:56] <Randull> I picked up jquery about 2 weeks ago, and I'm having a little trouble debugging for IE8 and below
[09:21:20] <Rafalski> Kambfhase: it's a call to a url... what else would i use?
[09:21:50] <Kambfhase> try text or whatever your http post returns
[09:22:07] <Kambfhase> ?g firebug light @ randull
[09:22:08] <bot-t> randull, Firebug Lite : Firebug - http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[09:22:14] <imsky> firebug lite suxx :(
[09:22:20] <imsky> use the real thing :D
[09:22:32] <Randull> ooh, I have it but neer use it, I work with chrome most of the time
[09:22:54] <Randull> I'll try fiddling with that a bit and check back, thx for the tip
[09:22:56] <subsume> Cork[home] so nextAll() gives me the <tr> and so does nextAll('tr') but nextAll('tr   td.span') gives me nothing
[09:23:11] <Randull> its jsut a stop script error I get in older versions of IE, works fine in IE9 and other modern browsers
[09:23:27] <dxgriffiths> freshmilk: Wow, sorry I really have no idea.
[09:23:38] <Kambfhase> subsume: try .nextAll('tr').find('td.span')
[09:23:45] <subsume> okay thanks.
[09:24:27] <Randull> Kambfhase, Firebug will help me debug IE specific issues?
[09:24:54] <Kambfhase> i hope so :o
[09:25:08] <Randull> heh, worth a shot!
[09:25:12] <Kambfhase> its better than alert, though
[09:25:57] <Altreus> how do I find all classes on an object? Shall I just .attr('class').split(' ')?
[09:26:04] <imsky> SHORE
[09:27:29] <subsume> Kambfhase the selector is working wonderfully, thank you. However the element doesn't seem to allow addClass() ? Isn't that odd?
[09:27:53] <Kambfhase> yes
[09:28:11] <sterna> hi, i'm having trouble using $.getJSON()
[09:28:26] <sterna> an error is raised in jquery on xhr.send
[09:29:00] <Cork[home]> sterna: what args do you give it?
[09:29:11] <sterna> url, [], function(x) {alert(x);}
[09:29:24] <sterna> url returns application/json and json without a newline at the and
[09:29:44] <sterna> it is valid json, i can decode it using simplejson in python and it validates against json lint
[09:29:44] <Cork[home]> steadicat: try null instead of []
[09:29:50] <sterna> you mean me :)
[09:29:51] <Cork[home]> *sterna: ^
[09:29:52] <sterna> ok, thanks
[09:30:03] <sterna> the same
[09:30:16] <subsume> Could someone help explain this one? http://dpaste.com/544292/
[09:30:23] <sterna> it's really weird because console in firebug displays response body as empty
[09:30:43] <Cork[home]> sterna: check so your json is valid
[09:31:09] <Cork[home]> subsume: [] will return the dom
[09:31:10] <sterna> {"data": [24, 380, 404]}
[09:31:12] <sterna> its is.
[09:31:15] <sterna> it is, even
[09:31:15] <Cork[home]> you want .eq
[09:31:23] <subsume> thakns.
[09:31:27] <sterna> HTTP/1.0 200 OK
[09:31:35] <Cork[home]> subsume: btw you can mergh those two finds
[09:31:37] <sterna> could it be a problem that response is 1.0 and not 1.1 ?
[09:31:46] <subsume> thanks.
[09:31:46] <Cork[home]> no
[09:31:54] <Cork[home]> sterna:^
[09:32:04] <sterna> yeah, let me paste that
[09:32:25] <sterna> http://dpaste.com/544296/
[09:32:32] <sterna> this is what i can tcpdump from response
[09:32:44] <sterna> i just changed to text/plain so i can see it in firefox
[09:32:56] <Cork[home]> sterna: your returning the wrong mimetype
[09:33:10] <Cork[home]> i don't remember if jquery is picky on that
[09:33:16] <Cork[home]> but it might be whats wrong
[09:33:20] <sterna> see here
[09:33:59] <Cork[home]> it should be application/json
[09:34:22] <sterna> Cork[home]: yeah i had that before and it's the same
[09:34:37] <sterna> xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );
[09:34:41] <sterna> this raises an error in jquery
[09:34:53] <sterna> s.data is "" as it should be
[09:35:00] <sterna> s looks OK
[09:35:02] <Cork[home]> ok, so it is the data element it reacts on
[09:35:28] <Cork[home]> sterna: one min i need to jsfiddle a bit :)
[09:35:45] <sterna> http://dpaste.com/544299/
[09:35:50] <sterna> this should work, right?
[09:36:34] <Cork[home]> sterna: ah!, found it
[09:36:51] <Cork[home]> sterna: if you don't want to send any data, you souldn't have that in there at all
[09:37:00] <sterna> do tell, i'm banging my head at
[09:37:02] <sterna> what. :)
[09:37:28] <Cork[home]> (url, [], function(x) {alert(x);}) should be url, [], function(x) {alert(x);}
[09:37:32] <Cork[home]> wrong...
[09:37:41] <Cork[home]> (url, [], function(x) {alert(x);}) should be (url, function(x) {alert(x);})
[09:37:48] <sterna> $.getJSON('http://venus:7010/counter', function(x) {alert(x);});
[09:37:52] <sterna> i get the same problem
[09:38:02] <Cork[home]> heh
[09:38:03] <sterna> jquery-1.6.1.js (line 7829)
[09:38:19] <sterna> which is "xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );"
[09:38:35] <Cork[home]> sterna: your running this on the venus server?
[09:38:38] <sterna> yes
[09:38:40] <Cork[home]> same port?
[09:38:46] <sterna> and i can see stuff in tcpdump coming back
[09:38:54] <sterna> what i pasted above
[09:39:06] <sterna> and i can open it in browser and it downloads a clean json
[09:39:18] <sterna> it's been bugging me for hours :)
[09:39:25] <sterna> and i bet it's something completely trivial
[09:39:27] <ravenzz> then do a $.ajax request
[09:39:34] <sterna> tried it, same error
[09:39:37] <ravenzz> and add some breakpoints
[09:39:45] <ravenzz> on success: error
[09:39:45] <ravenzz> etc
[09:40:26] <sterna> just a sec
[09:40:28] <Cork[home]> sterna: whats the error you get from the code?
[09:40:34] <sterna> i have no idea
[09:40:35] <Cork[home]> the exact error message that is
[09:40:44] <ravenzz> maybe it depends by the content type
[09:40:45] <ravenzz> ?
[09:40:46] <sterna> i can show you a screenshot
[09:40:52] <Cork[home]> sterna: no idea?
[09:40:57] <Cork[home]> what browser is this?`
[09:41:05] <sterna> there is no error, i'm typing this into the firebug console
[09:41:07] <sterna> firefox 3
[09:41:09] <sterna> 3.6
[09:41:22] <Cork[home]> didn't you say it stops at the xhr.send?
[09:41:35] <sterna> yes
[09:41:45] <Cork[home]> and that should return an error message in your console
[09:43:30] <sterna> that's the weird bit
[09:43:32] <sterna> i don't get one
[09:44:10] <Cork[home]> sterna: run your code through something like jslint then
[09:44:17] <Cork[home]> this sounds wierd
[09:44:35] <Cork[home]> btw i test run getjson call, and it works perfectly on jsfiddle
[09:44:39] <sterna> http://bou.si/rest/errorbutno.jpg
[09:44:46] <Cork[home]> http://jsfiddle.net/zqHv4/
[09:45:30] <Cork[home]> sterna: thats how it usuually look when the responce fails at parsing
[09:45:40] <Cork[home]> *usually
[09:46:06] <ravenzz> sterna look at headers
[09:46:12] <sterna> i am looking at them
[09:46:15] <ravenzz> could it depends by content type
[09:46:16] <ravenzz> ?
[09:46:27] <Cork[home]> ya, i think thats one of the problems
[09:46:27] <sterna> http://dpaste.com/544301/
[09:47:05] <sterna> what should i use for content type? it's set to application/json now
[09:47:16] <Cork[home]> sterna: thats the correct one
[09:47:35] <Cork[home]> sterna: could you include the complete http responce?
[09:47:42] <Cork[home]> header and body
[09:47:52] <sterna> i can tcpdump it
[09:48:15] <Michael> application/json is correct for json
[09:48:29] <ravenzz> yep
[09:48:33] <sterna> http://dpaste.com/544302/
[09:48:39] <sterna> request and response
[09:49:14] <ravenzz> mh?
[09:49:18] <Cork[home]> man there just isn't anything wrong there...
[09:49:23] <ravenzz> Referer: http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/
[09:49:23] <ravenzz> Origin: http://fiddle.jshell.net
[09:49:32] <TonkaTruck> Has anyone posted a malicious jsfiddle yet?  I'm wondering when that day is coming.
[09:49:39] <ravenzz> could json go cross-domain?
[09:49:48] <Cork[home]> no
[09:49:57] <sterna> hm
[09:50:00] <Michael> TonkaTruck, I never use IE.
[09:50:04] <sterna> are you sure?
[09:50:10] <ravenzz> maybe it is the problem
[09:50:13] <sterna> i can't request a page from mercury and json from venus?
[09:50:14] <Cork[home]> sterna: ya, and thats why i asked before
[09:50:16] <ravenzz> sterna jsonp
[09:50:21] <Cork[home]> you said it wasn't >_>
[09:50:23] <sterna> what's jsonp? :)
[09:50:32] <sterna> the callback thing?
[09:50:41] <Cork[home]> sterna: json is returnd in a function through a js script
[09:50:53] <Cork[home]> you load a js file with a function in in the header
[09:51:00] <Cork[home]> then call the function and let it return the json
[09:51:06] <Cork[home]> its a workaround for cross domain
[09:51:16] <sterna> thanks
[09:51:17] <TonkaTruck> Michael: Me either...but vulnerabilities pop up every now and then.
[09:51:27] <sterna> let me try it out
[09:51:30] <Cork[home]> sterna: jquery has native support for it
[09:51:48] <flaco> hi all... how can I get the all elements with class="someClass" ??
[09:51:49] <sterna> mhm, but i need to modify the response, right?
[09:52:08] <ravenzz> flaco $('.someClass')
[09:52:13] <sterna> it can't be json, but javascript code?
[09:52:21] <sterna> a function that returns json?
[09:52:31] <Cork[home]> sterna: yes it needs to respond with text/javascript
[09:52:47] <Cork[home]> and it needs to take the param callback as the name of the js function
[09:53:16] <Cork[home]> and you need to add ?callback=<your_function_name> to your url for the getJSON
[09:53:25] <tbranyen> well you don't have to
[09:53:29] <Cork[home]> the rest will jquery fix
[09:53:44] <sterna> Cork[home]: if i add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to the headers
[09:53:46] <sterna> would that work?
[09:53:56] <tbranyen> sterna: not cross browser, but it will for modern shiz
[09:53:58] <Cork[home]> sterna: only in browsers that lisen for that
[09:54:06] <Cork[home]> sterna: aka. not ie
[09:54:23] <sterna> ok yeah great
[09:54:28] <Cork[home]> more or less all chrome and ff from 2.5+ will
[09:54:37] <sterna> i just need this for a visualization app for an embedded device
[09:54:43] <sterna> i got chromium there
[09:54:58] <Cork[home]> i don't think many use ff 2.5 anymore anyway ;)
[09:55:10] <sterna> aw man this works
[09:55:20] <Kambfhase> note to self: setting top to NaNpx does not help. :|
[09:55:29] <Cork[home]> lol
[09:58:48] <Ely^> hi :)
[09:58:54] <Bonkie> hi
[10:01:01] <subsume> hi
[10:01:15] <imsky> hi
[10:01:30] <Randull> hello
[10:03:56] <TC_> I got a bug in LT IE9. If you have LT IE9, test out: http://87.102.72.153/textboxlist/ click the textbox then click off of it. The notice ("type to recieve suggestons") doesn't disappear. On IE9, it does. The code for is, view source: $(window).click(function (event) { < this line.
[10:04:05] <srj55> I would like to use jquery form plugin to submit a form via ajax.  However, I don't want to simply dump the response into a 'target' element as this plugin allows.  I want to dump a *specific response element* into a target element.  Since the plugin doesn't allow this, maybe I could use the success callback to update the target?
[10:04:45] <TC_> How could I fix it, but still allow it to work on all browsers.
[10:05:25] <Kambfhase> TC_:  try $(document).click(...)
[10:05:26] <TC_> the blur event won't work because it allows it to disappear BEFORE nay other actiosn taking place.
[10:05:30] <TC_> ok.
[10:05:32] <TC_> i'll try.
[10:06:00] <Multi> Hello, I have an ajax loaded bit of javascript that I can't get to run. I'm currently trying: $('.myElement).ready(myJS());
[10:07:35] <TC_> You're the man Kambfhase ;)
[10:07:41] <Kambfhase> \o/
[10:08:08] <sanjana> hello

[10:09:14] <Multi> bot-t, Kambfhase thanks I'll try that
[10:09:15] <bot-t> Multi, Couldn't find "Kambfhase thanks I'll try that" in jQuery Docs.
[10:09:16] * Randull loves that answer!
[10:09:34] <TC_> haha
[10:09:50] <Kambfhase> *sniff* i'm not in the docs :'(

[10:11:03] <TC_> dodgey characters.
[10:11:42] <mikepack> Is there a way to check of text is overflowing a div with jQuery?
[10:15:21] <TonkaTruck> mikepack: I'd be curious to know what .height() returns on a div _inside_ of a overflow:hidden parent.
[10:15:46] <mikepack> TonkaTruck: mmmm me too
[10:15:49] <TonkaTruck> When it extends beyond the height or width of the parent.  If so, that would be a good way to detect it.
[10:16:12] <gnarf> TonkaTruck: i'm pretty sure it returns the same thing it returns for any other "visible" element
[10:16:32] <gnarf> ?mdc scrollHeight @mikepack
[10:16:33] <bot-t> mikepack, element.scrollHeight - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[10:16:44] <TonkaTruck> gnarf: I would've assumed that the calculated height was just that...regardless of how much of it was visible through it's parent.
[10:17:13] <gnarf> "When an element's content does not generate a vertical scrollbar, then its scrollHeight property is equal to its clientHeight property."
[10:17:28] <TonkaTruck> ta-da
[10:17:50] <gnarf> careful tho
[10:17:53] <gnarf> its MISE's spec
[10:17:55] <gnarf> not w3c
[10:17:58] <gnarf> so browser test
[10:17:59] <gnarf> :)
[10:18:08] <gnarf> dunno if opera supports
[10:18:19] <gnarf> but im sure you can find a workaround for it with some googles
[10:18:38] <ch3mical> mmm teh googles
[10:19:05] <djQuery> what if its set to hide the scrollable content
[10:19:09] <imsky> gnarf, you're making everyone nervous with the op
[10:19:22] <gnarf> hrm
[10:19:25] <gnarf> when did i op?
[10:20:18] <imsky> gracias amigo
[10:20:53] * gnarf wonders why he had ops in the first place
[10:21:23] <gnarf> did I leave that on all night? :)
[10:21:28] <imsky> you probably stayed up drinking last night
[10:21:33] <imsky> and decided to screw with a bunch of people
[10:21:40] <tbranyen> 18:46  * gnarf lolz @ ajpiano
[10:21:44] <gnarf> nope, no kick roulette last night
[10:21:45] <tbranyen> crap wrong paste
[10:21:48] <tbranyen> it was around that time tho
[10:22:00] <gnarf> tbranyen: yeah - piano oped
[10:22:04] <gnarf> then i oped
[10:22:09] <gnarf> i guess i forgot to unop
[10:22:23] <gnarf> oh well
[10:22:39] <gnarf> there, i'll wear a plus
[10:22:50] <gnarf> gotta run ;) --- bbiab
[10:23:06] <TonkaTruck> This javascriptmvc thing is really growing on me.
[10:24:08] <wafflesburger> its pretty unnecessary TonkaTruck
[10:24:15] <wafflesburger> js kiddies just want to feel like they're programmers :D
[10:24:58] <imsky> lol if you feel that way
[10:25:01] <imsky> gtfo #jquery
[10:25:58] <mikepack> gnarf: Thanks for the link!
[10:26:35] <TonkaTruck> wafflesburger: I think a lot of them come into it thinking that jsmvc does a lot more than it does... .Class is just resig's inheritance library...and .Controller is just a  widget factory.  It's quite small...but the organization is what makes it great.
[10:27:26] <wafflesburger> imsky why would i do that? i don't feel jquery is there for this reason
[10:27:38] <imsky> wat\
[10:27:41] <TonkaTruck> I didn't know who he was talking to.
[10:28:47] <TonkaTruck> I kind of giggled the other day when I mentioned jsmvc and someone said "go to #jsframeworks" or something...like it's not totally relevant to #jquery.  Reminds me of #javascript and how you simply aren't allowed to discuss #jquery.  Old farts...
[10:32:17] <wafflesburger> if you want mvc js
[10:32:22] <wafflesburger> go to #documentcloud :D
[10:33:22] <TonkaTruck> http://itssojustcloud.com/
[10:33:50] <lisak> how to deal with situation if you have a handler with ONLY one argument (because it handles other events) but  widgets trigger is like this  _trigger(name, e, data)
[10:34:09] <lisak> handler(data);
[10:34:19] <lisak> data is always "event"
[10:34:24] <lisak> nomatter what I do
[10:35:42] <lisak> the only thing I can come up with is having some handlerAdapter(event, data)  that ignores the event and calls handler(data)
[10:38:15] <Kambfhase> it moves!
[10:38:22] <lisak> thanks god
[10:39:14] <lisak> if I do trigger(name, data)    than  it resolves to  handler(event)
[10:39:21] <lisak> instead of handler(data)
[10:39:29] <lisak> then*
[10:39:56] <Kambfhase> jquery does not know how you name your arguments, all it cares about is the order
[10:40:21] <Kambfhase> and the order it passes them to your function is specified in the docs.
[10:40:22] <srj55> I would like to use jquery form plugin to submit a form via ajax.  However, I don't want to simply dump the response into a 'target' element as this plugin allows.  I want to dump a *specific response element* into a target element.  Since the plugin doesn't allow this, maybe I could use the success callback to update the target?
[10:41:17] <lisak> Kambfhase, it is very inconvenient ...  then all handlers of widgets trigger method must have 2 arguments
[10:42:14] <Kambfhase> too bad
[10:42:31] <lisak> yep it is
[10:42:42] <sokie_de> is there a jQuery plugin which shows css rules like p.e text-shadow in IEs(6+)
[10:43:38] <Kambfhase> lisak: wall you coud do function fix( handler){ return function( a,b,c){ return handler( c); }; }
[10:44:24] <lisak> yes that;s the adapter I was talking about, it's ugly but works
[10:44:33] <Hilikus> hey guys
[10:46:12] <Hilikus> i'm having a weird problem. i have a page with a <div id="page_content"></div>   i have some jquery code to fill it up. so i do a request using ajax and i do get the result. i can see it. however, when i do $("#page_content").html(result) or .append(result) the loading doesn't work in IE. in firefox it works fine
[10:46:42] <Hilikus> the ajax response doesn't get injected in IE8
[10:46:57] <Hilikus> any idea what can cause this?
[10:47:15] <sokie_de> that is weird
[10:47:36] <jared__> Hilikus, do you have anything in place for catching ajax errors? It's been a while but I know ajax can return multiple statuses. Can you tell if it returns the correct ajax status?
[10:47:52] <jared__> 200 or whatever
[10:48:02] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Hilikus
[10:48:02] <bot-t> Hilikus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[10:48:27] <Hilikus> jared i'm using the success callback in $.ajax
[10:49:17] <jared__> Hilikus, yeah I'd try showing a paste of the code
[10:50:36] <jared__> not to hijack you, but i have a quick question as well. Lets say I have multiple children divs in a parent. How to I use a number to select a specific one? For instance, lets say I want to select number X, where X is one of the child elements
[10:51:02] <jared__> like children[2] or something
[10:51:44] <sokie_de> $("#parend" div:eq(x)")
[10:51:49] <Kambfhase> ?eq @ jared__
[10:51:49] <bot-t> jared__, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:52:13] <jared__> sokie_de, thanks
[10:52:14] <voogzy> anyone know how to check if a youtube embedded video has finished playing ad perform some function?
[10:52:19] <sokie_de> yw
[10:52:20] <voogzy> without the youtube api
[10:52:58] <Bonkie> can anyone tell me why my jQuery UI is screwed like this? : http://www.screencast.com/users/Bonkie/folders/ServerReporter/media/0c8c44d3-3eb7-4516-8e9a-351193aae1ab
[10:57:09] <jedimind_> what part of that looks screwed up ?
[10:57:49] <Bonkie> that data-table thing
[10:57:52] <Bonkie> at Communication
[10:59:13] <jedimind_> probably because you have some css breaking it
[10:59:26] <Bonkie> but I cant find it
[10:59:32] <jedimind_> like img { display: block; }
[10:59:33] <jedimind_> would do that
[11:00:00] <jedimind_> but you might want to expose the source code behind this (ie not just a screenshot) and ask in #css
[11:01:13] <v0lZy> Hello
[11:01:18] <Bonkie> well the css is readable if you go to the page haha :-)
[11:01:25] <v0lZy> Can somone help me with a fadeIn and fadeOut difficulty
[11:02:11] <v0lZy> I have 3 divs which have anchors that have width and height set to 100%.. so they are like clickable slides of a presentation
[11:02:17] <v0lZy> now, when I click a slide
[11:02:50] <v0lZy> I want i to fadeout itself, and the slide it is scrolling then at the same time, scroll o the slide we are going to, and fade it in
[11:03:15] <tomasm-> anyone here use jeditable? i'm trying to use the placeholder but i'd like to add a style to it, ie put the placeholder (not the real text) in grey, so it looks different.... but there is no styling applied to placeholders from what i can see
[11:03:22] <Soothsayer> Could someone recommend a validation library?
[11:03:27] <Soothsayer> form validation*
[11:03:39] <v0lZy> but since the script sets display: none.. and for osme unknown reason, this sequence of events sets the slide im scrolling to as display none and doesnt fade it back in, as a result i lose the ability to click on the slide and progress ot the next one.
[11:04:00] <Hilikus> aaah the problem was an inbalanced div in the response
[11:04:10] <Hilikus> thanks anyway guys
[11:04:46] <tomasm-> can i have an event triggered when content inside a container changes?
[11:05:53] <straen> $(element).change(function() { doStuff();}
[11:05:55] <skamikaze> ?trigger @ tomasm-
[11:05:55] <bot-t> tomasm-, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:06:03] <straen> or that
[11:07:18] <straen> does anyone know why, when I load a form dynamically (using .load() or .post()) the form no longer submits, and can't be serialize()d?
[11:07:23] <tomasm-> skamikaze, no, i mean when something else changes the content of a container, i want to react to it
[11:07:39] <skamikaze> you can fire your own event
[11:07:49] <skamikaze> (or just define a callback)
[11:09:10] <chovy> is jqtouch supported in here?
[11:09:19] <tomasm-> skamikaze, i dont have control over the content being change or calling a trigger(), since its 3rd party code doing the change
[11:09:32] <jeffsmykil> $("input#registrationSubmit").blur();
[11:09:40] <jeffsmykil> shouldnt that blur the submit button
[11:10:02] <atula> jeffsmykil: it should. I wouldn't need the input in front really
[11:10:08] <atula> but it's not working ?
[11:10:10] <atula> what's going on?
[11:10:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[11:10:16] <jeffsmykil> hold on two seconds
[11:10:29] <sokie_de> you need your eventhandlers to live() if they're on elements that a later added to the dom, strean
[11:10:41] <Jayflux> or .delegate sokie_de
[11:10:41] <jeffsmykil> i guess i dont want to blur
[11:10:42] <sokie_de> ?live
[11:10:42] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:10:46] <jeffsmykil> i want to disable atula
[11:11:06] <jeffsmykil> should I just hide it
[11:11:16] <atula> no no.. you can disable it with attr... lemme check
[11:11:21] <Kambfhase> straen: jquery.com -> FAQ -> why do my events top working
[11:11:23] <atula> there has been a recent change about htis I think
[11:11:26] <atula> jeffsmykil:
[11:11:27] <Kambfhase> try that
[11:11:55] <straen> ooh
[11:11:58] <straen> k, thanks
[11:12:00] <atula> jeffsmykil: what version of jquery ?
[11:12:03] <jeffsmykil> atula: im still using 1.4.1
[11:12:10] <jeffsmykil> in production
[11:12:16] <atula> oh I see
[11:12:38] <atula> you probably can do something like .attr('disabled', 'true') or 'disabled' 'disabled' hhmmm lemme try to remember
[11:12:48] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[11:13:01] <atula> disabled, disabled I believe
[11:13:06] <skamikaze> disabled, true
[11:13:13] <sphinxxx> theres so many jquery plugin templates out there, is one better than another?
[11:13:35] <jeffsmykil> disabled true
[11:13:36] <jeffsmykil> it was
[11:13:39] <jeffsmykil> ty guys
[11:15:34] <jeffsmykil> huh is it just disabled false
[11:15:36] <jeffsmykil> or enabled true
[11:15:51] <jeffsmykil> either wau i cant seem to enable it the way i want to
[11:18:13] <jeffsmykil> ah remove attribute
[11:18:57] <atula> jeffsmykil: yep removeAttr
[11:19:49] <sokie_de> is that new prop() thingy an only "getter" method, or can it be used as "setter" thou?
[11:21:07] <tomasm-> is there an event automatically (not manually via trigger() ) called after an element is updated via $(element).html() ?
[11:21:37] <tomasm-> it's a div, so i dont think .change() will work
[11:23:45] <atula> skamikaze: jeffsmykil is using 1.4.1 is disable true already exist in that version ?
[11:24:17] <skamikaze> afaik yes
[11:27:51] <srj55> I'm using jquery form plugin which has a success callback:  function showResponse(responseText, statusText, xhr, $form).   Can I use one of these variables like:     $('#myid').html(responseText.find('#ResultWrapper'));  ?   responseText is a string.  how can i parse it?
[11:29:38] <djQuery> sphinxxx: I like the jquery.ui.template engine. it seems to have all the necessary parts
[11:30:12] <Whirl3d> Good Morning. If you have an image element that has not been loaded and has $.data, will that data remain once the image is loaded?
[11:30:15] <jeffsmykil> submitting should be as easy as elementname.submit()?
[11:31:05] <ngharo> where elementname is your form
[11:31:11] <jeffsmykil> oh the form
[11:31:13] <jeffsmykil> not the input
[11:31:14] <sphinxxx> djQuery, do you happen to have a link ?
[11:32:47] <freeed> hey guys, im trying to unselect a selected radio input. The radios all have checked=checked, when I do  $('.myradio').attr('checked', false)  I no longer see the checked=checked attribute in the View Source Chart output.. however, visually in the browser I still see the radio is selected. Any ideas what i'm doing wrong? Thanks!
[11:33:38] <freeed> also tried removeAttr('checked')  which shows the same behavior.
[11:34:51] <thm> does anybody know the datetime plugin (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/datetime) and how to call sth. when the datetime changes?
[11:34:53] <jonclark> are you using jquery 1.6 by any chance, freeed?
[11:35:02] <freeed> jonclark, yes.
[11:35:15] <jonclark> try removeProp('checked')
[11:35:20] <freeed> k
[11:35:21] <jonclark> they changed how attributes and properties are handled
[11:35:25] <jonclark> http://api.jquery.com/removeProp/
[11:36:00] <freeed> Yay! Thanks jonclark :) perfecto :p
[11:36:23] <djQuery> sphinxxx: see ?.tmpl
[11:36:24] <bot-t> sphinxxx, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[11:36:45] <Whirl3d> Ok. More generic question: if you assign a class to an image (in the dom) and then load the image, does the class assignment remain?
[11:37:52] <jonclark> it should.. right?
[11:38:13] <jonclark> if i make an empty div in the dom and give a class, then append it to the body, it'll have that class for sure
[11:38:35] <Whirl3d> I'm just in the middle of a big chunk of code and didn't have a chance to test it.
[11:39:13] <djQuery> Whirl3d: var x =  $('<img />', {src: '/images/test.jpg', alt: 'Hello world', 'class': 'imageclass'}).appendTo('#mydiv').hasClass('imageclass'); console.log(x);
[11:40:00] <Whirl3d> djQuery, I always forget that I can type directly into the console. <--braindead. Thanks.
[11:40:28] <sphinxxx> thx djquery
[11:40:49] <ch3mical> Man, I love jQuery
[11:41:06] <HBD> Guys, what Grid do you recommend to use with JQuery?
[11:41:07] <Whirl3d> jonClark, false. LOL So the class is rewritten on load
[11:41:18] <sphinxxx> djquery i think you meant to respond to someone else with that?
[11:42:08] <djQuery> sphinxxx: you asked for a link didnt you? see ?.tmpl
[11:42:08] <bot-t> sphinxxx, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[11:42:33] <Whirl3d> jonClark, wait---i was wrong
[11:42:36] <necromancer`brb> hey i have the following code https://gist.github.com/981425
[11:42:43] <sphinxxx> oh i was just asking for a template to use in building a plugin
[11:42:44] <necromancer> why am i not recieving any callbacks?
[11:42:51] <necromancer> the JSON response checks out okay..
[11:43:04] <ch3mical> necromancer: not enough mojo
[11:43:05] <Whirl3d> jonClark, because I didn't have a "myDiv" item in the dom to attach the element to, it returned false.
[11:43:15] <ch3mical> necromancer: I get calls back all the time ;)
[11:43:19] <jonclark> :)
[11:43:23] <sphinxxx> nevermind, looks like i need to read this more, thx
[11:43:28] <Whirl3d> var x=$("<img/>", {src:'/images/test.jpg'}).addClass("imageClass").appendTo("body").hasClass("imageClass"); console.log(x);
[11:43:32] <necromancer> ch3mical: ugh how much does austin powers cost? i need his javascript skillz
[11:43:45] <ch3mical> buahaha
[11:45:13] <ch3mical> necromancer: if you have a page where that code is live I could try to look at it
[11:45:28] <ch3mical> It's tough to troubleshoot AJAX just by looking at it
[11:45:32] <ch3mical> :/
[11:45:48] <necromancer> ch3mical: ahh that sucks, i can't release the full code yet
[11:45:55] <necromancer> maybe after launch but right now we have to keep it under wraps
[11:46:02] <necromancer> oh well, i guess they don't NEED that feature right now.. :)
[11:46:15] <necromancer> site's gotta be ready by tomorrow and yesterday we got a new design for this stupid newsletter signup
[11:46:20] <djQuery> necromancer: is that data in there correctly? data: 'email='+field.val(),
[11:46:21] <necromancer> =\ =\
[11:46:24] <necromancer> yes
[11:46:31] <necromancer> i'm getting a proper response
[11:46:33] <ch3mical> necromancer: can't you just write a demo page where it does nothing but attempt the AJAX call? That way you aren't revealing anything
[11:46:37] <Whirl3d> And the data items persist! var x=$("<img/>").data("test",100).appendTo("body").data("test");console.log(x);
[11:46:43] <djQuery> necromancer: data: {email: field.val()}
[11:47:01] <ch3mical> necromancer: What does the HTTP response header header say for the dataType?
[11:47:02] <necromancer> djQuery: both work
[11:47:07] <necromancer> ch3mical: JSON
[11:47:20] <necromancer> ch3mical: no i can't, it makes use of a PHP file on my local computer that jsfiddle won't be able to access iirc
[11:47:29] <Soothsayer> Anyone would recommend the jQuery tools form validator for client-side form validation ?
[11:47:33] <necromancer> well, not that jsFiddle won't be able to get it, but you won't
[11:47:42] <necromancer> Soothsayer: jQuery.validate
[11:47:42] <ch3mical> Turn on XMLHttpRequest Logging?
[11:47:52] <necromancer> ch3mical: do i do that through firebug?
[11:47:52] <chovy> can someone recommend a jquery plugin to support touch devices (ie: iPad, iPhone, Android) but will still work with Desktop browsers?
[11:47:58] <Soothsayer> necromancer: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ ?
[11:48:01] <ch3mical> necromancer: right click in the console
[11:48:13] <djQuery> necromancer: jsfiddle has the capability to do json echos
[11:48:19] <ch3mical> Well, in Chrome anyway
[11:48:19] <necromancer> Soothsayer: yup!
[11:48:30] <Soothsayer> necromancer: have you tried jquery tools validate?
[11:48:31] <necromancer> there's just no other substitute except writing your own
[11:48:41] <djQuery> Soothsayer: that wont realy help him tell if an email is in the database before the submit
[11:48:43] <necromancer> Soothsayer: no i thought you just screwed up your english :)
[11:48:50] <necromancer> and you were asking for a validator plugin
[11:49:09] <Soothsayer> http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/validator/index.html
[11:49:14] <Soothsayer> well, im trying to compare the two
[11:49:35] <Soothsayer> djQuery: why not? I thought the jQuery.Validate had support for ajax validation.
[11:49:41] <jeffsmykil> is there a focus function?
[11:50:06] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: there's a focus event (blur)
[11:50:16] <jeffsmykil> .focus(function()?
[11:50:25] <ch3mical> see ?.blur()
[11:50:25] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[11:50:39] <jeffsmykil> isnt blur the opposite
[11:50:43] <ch3mical> also see ?.unblur()
[11:50:45] <bot-t> ch3mical, imageeffects 1.0.3 | jQuery Plugins - Now includes a blur / unblur animation type as well as the classic frame effects. http://plugins.jquery.com/content/imageeffects-103
[11:50:57] <ch3mical> Wait, is that not it?
[11:51:22] <djQuery> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/captcha/
[11:51:27] <ch3mical> Oh right, I had it backwards
[11:51:30] <execution> if i need 30 links to turn yellow when they're hovered over, should i use jquery mouseover/mouseout if i'm already appending click handlers to those buttons? or, should i use css's :hover for the color change? how much quicker / less work is it for the browser to use :hover for a text color change in stead of jquery's mouseover/mouseout pair?
[11:51:39] <jeffsmykil> i basically want to know which form element im focused on
[11:51:47] <djQuery> Soothsayer: hadnt looked into that aspect yet
[11:52:24] <ch3mical> necromancer: so when you say "not getting a response" does that mean none of the "success" or "error" etc functions are being fired?
[11:53:38] <Soothsayer> necromancer: I feel jquery.Validate is difficult to use and remember. the jQuery tools validator uses html5 markup for most of the validations.
[11:53:38] <ch3mical> or "not receiving any callbacks" I think you said
[11:53:44] <t4nkd> Hey all, I'm having an issue with jCarousel; it seems that in verticalCarousel mode it dosen't take into account the width of the container -- is this intended or is there a known way of hacking this functionality?
[11:53:46] <djQuery> complete: fucntion(){console.log('ajax completed');}
[11:54:05] <necromancer> ch3mical: that's right. no callbacks, but in firebug i see the GET request being made, and i can see the JSON response contained inside
[11:54:18] <djQuery> Soothsayer: validate can use them as well
[11:54:30] <ch3mical> necromancer: try JSONP?
[11:55:25] <zelak> is there a more elegant way to select an element by id, when the id is stored in a variable, than $('#' + var)?
[11:55:26] <Soothsayer> djQuery: ye, but instead of required="required",  we're using a class="required"
[11:55:43] <Soothsayer> but yes, jQuery.validate looks really extensive
[11:55:49] <davidmurdoch> off-topic alert!    danheberden, I've got a pretty decent-sized company that would like to talk to you about rewardjs. Whats the best way to contact you?
[11:56:20] <danheberden> davidmurdoch pm me your email address so i can have richard contact you
[11:57:37] <execution> the first person to know the answer to my above question gets a lollipop and a handshake
[11:57:42] <mightym> hey guys im new to jquery/js and wonder how i can check if a value of variable changed? like  "if (foo.changed()) { ?
[11:57:44] <davidmurdoch> eh, actually. Just read this: https://twitter.com/#!/Grooveshark/status/71275348389670913
[11:58:28] <davidmurdoch> oops" danheberden " look up a line.
[11:58:36] <danheberden> heh, got it :) cheers!
[12:00:39] <djQuery> damn need to go find a bug to fix to win the Quadri-
[12:00:39] <djQuery> copter
[12:01:11] <davidmurdoch> djQuery its alot harder than I thought.
[12:02:09] <davidmurdoch> I've fixed quite a few bugs and submitted pull reqs but they just can't review everything.
[12:02:53] <Jon47> mightym you can't just check if it changed like that
[12:03:04] <Jon47> you'd need to store the old value and compare the current value
[12:03:20] <Soothsayer> necromancer, djQuery : tried http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/ ?
[12:04:04] <fructose> newb here... how do I write my error: function() for a $.ajax to get information about the cause of the error? The example I was following used XMLHttpRequest as the first argument, but I don't know how to display that
[12:04:20] <jspeaks> hi... is it possible to query a json object with jquery for an xpath like feature
[12:04:36] <djQuery> Soothsayer: what I am more worried about is something to make all the html5 elements work on ie6
[12:05:05] <Soothsayer> djQuery: jquery tools validator does that
[12:05:27] <Soothsayer> just trying it again to be sure
[12:05:39] <djQuery> <input type="range" min="-5" max="30" />
[12:05:45] <Soothsayer> yup, jquery tools validator works great in  IE6
[12:06:31] <jspeaks> what's the irc protocol for asking a question... "HAND RAISED"...
[12:06:34] <djQuery> Soothsayer: had dismissed them in the past because thier examples didn't work on thier examples page. will have to take another look
[12:06:52] <djQuery> ?ask@jspeaks
[12:06:56] <Soothsayer> djQuery: oh, a lot of people complaining about that
[12:07:13] <djQuery> ?ask
[12:07:16] <Soothsayer> djQuery: they still don't work. I'm not sure why the author has not fixed it. Mainly, it's happening because of the latest chrome and firefox 4 update.
[12:07:26] <djQuery> damit whats up with bot-t???
[12:07:29] <Soothsayer> you got to add <form novalidate="novalidate"      to make the examples work
[12:07:53] <djQuery> Soothsayer: they should make that an option in the plugin
[12:08:27] <Soothsayer> djQuery: yes, i think there's a patch that makes all forms no validate by default. Or it's one line of js anyway $('form').attr('novalidate', 'novalidate');
[12:09:49] <jspeaks> ? i have a json object with a bunch of properties that is basically a recordset... i want a simple mechanism to return a subset of the records based on a query ... in kinda the jquery/xpath syntax... is it possible in jquery?  i wrapped my json object in $(jsonObject).filter(), however the result didn't look like what i expected and i didn't see how to iterate the data from the result
[12:09:54] <Soothsayer> I can't find a way to contact the owner of jquery tools!
[12:10:01] <Soothsayer> i wonder why he has not fixed it
[12:10:13] <fructose> newb here... how do I write my error: function() for a $.ajax to get information about the cause of the error? The example I was following used XMLHttpRequest as the first argument, but I don't know how to display that
[12:10:33] <djQuery> Soothsayer: what a about <input type="text" list="states" /> <datalist id="states"><option value="AL">Alaska</option>...............</datalist>
[12:10:34] <ch3mical> jspeaks: try JSON.parse(jsonObject)
[12:11:11] <Soothsayer> djQuery: I've never seen something like that
[12:11:26] <HBD> Good Grid, anyone?
[12:11:28] <necromancer> Soothsayer: i don't find jQuery.validate that difficult to use for general purpose stuff
[12:12:09] <djQuery> Soothsayer: the list attribute and the datalist elements are new to html5 no one supports them yet that I know of
[12:12:10] <ch3mical> jspeaks: then you should be able to access the data following the JSON path, like var myjson = JSON.parse(jsonObject); console.log(myjson.item.etc), assuming your JSON is something like { "item": { "etc": false } }
[12:12:17] <ch3mical> jspeaks: make sense?
[12:12:38] <djQuery> HBD: see jqgrid
[12:12:54] <HBD> djQuery: that's too hard to use :-(
[12:13:03] <ch3mical> "Too hard"??
[12:13:13] <djQuery> jquery.ui.grid then its easier but still in beta
[12:13:30] <HBD> djQuery: I'll check that one, thanks
[12:13:34] <jspeaks> ch3mical: yes... looking
[12:15:17] <jeffsmykil> is focus an attribute?
[12:15:25] <jeffsmykil> how do idetermine an element has focus
[12:15:30] <jspeaks> ch3mical: oh... the json is already in the global namespace and i can reference it, i was just looking for a quick way to return only the items i was looking for without doing a for loop
[12:15:44] <Soothsayer> necromancer: hmm.. try out jquery tools validator sometime and tell me if you find jquery.validate as easy
[12:15:50] <Vaerros> jeffsmykil: in jquery, a number of ways
[12:16:00] <jspeaks> ch3mical: i guess maybe .each could work
[12:16:04] <Vaerros> jeffsmykil: could just do $.is(':focus') with recent versions
[12:16:15] <jeffsmykil> does that work in 1.4.1?
[12:16:18] <necromancer> Soothsayer: does tools validator allow you to define your own rules?
[12:16:22] <maxmoore14> anybody know an advanced tutorial for creating plugins?
[12:16:28] <Vaerros> I don't believe so...I meant it triggering an error in like 1.4.2
[12:16:32] <Vaerros> remember*
[12:16:35] <maxmoore14> I've googled a ton, and they are all too simple
[12:16:54] <djQuery> jeffsmykil: document.activeElement
[12:17:11] <jeffsmykil> yeah i tried that the documentation is kind of bad
[12:17:19] <ch3mical> jspeaks: if the jsonObject is actually a js object, then you should be able to explore the tree using the notation/path as I described
[12:17:28] <Soothsayer> necromancer: yes, very much.
[12:17:45] <ch3mical> jspeaks: jsonObject.toplevel.subitem etc
[12:17:59] <HBD> Will JQuery ever have a layour manager?
[12:18:04] <maxmoore14> can someone look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Yh5T5/
[12:18:04] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: var activeFormItem = ($document.activeElement);
[12:18:23] <maxmoore14> I know the "settings" are in the wrong place, just not sure where to put them
[12:18:24] <ch3mical> where "toplevel" is a key in the top level of the JSON tree, and "subitem" exists inside of "toplevel" in the tree
[12:18:33] <jspeaks> ch3mical: but is there a way to do something like return jsonObject.filter("type=video");
[12:18:55] <ch3mical> jspeaks: match() ?
[12:19:02] <djQuery> jeffsmykil: $(':focus')
[12:19:08] <jspeaks> ch3mical: let me look
[12:19:33] <maxmoore14> anyone?
[12:19:34] <ch3mical> Well, I guess match would still require looping
[12:19:46] <ch3mical> There's a way to do what you want, I'm sure of it
[12:20:01] <ch3mical> If I could see an example of your code, it would help me visualize this better
[12:20:06] <jeffsmykil> djQuery:

[12:20:30] <jspeaks> ch3mical: yeah... 1 sec... let me load it up

[12:30:32] <necromancer> Soothsayer: that's one thing i didn't like about jquery.validate...it's difficult to define custom rules when you need them
[12:31:13] <necromancer> Soothsayer: is pattern="" a real attribute?
[12:31:15] <jspeaks> ch3mical: so the query idea was to limit the results to only items that are type=map, etc... similar to what you do in mongodb style syntax
[12:31:33] <Soothsayer> necromancer: yes
[12:31:38] <necromancer> oh sweet
[12:32:01] <Soothsayer> necromancer: and that's the exact reason I didn't like jquery.validate
[12:32:11] <necromancer> well, it's quite old by this point. :)
[12:32:42] <necromancer> i've had issues with HTML5 being auto-styled on firefox
[12:32:47] <necromancer> like if i set a field as required
[12:32:53] <necromancer> and i don't type anything in that box
[12:32:55] <necromancer> it shows up a red border
[12:33:11] <necromancer> well what if i want a maroon, or black, or white border? firefox 4 doesn't allow me to change that. webkit browsers don't have it, but firefox 4 at least does..
[12:33:24] <necromancer> so i'm stuck unless i want to abandon the required attr altogether and just set a class
[12:34:13] <Soothsayer> Anyone using headjs ?
[12:35:21] <necromancer> does that go on top of beerjs? ;)
[12:37:58] * Soothsayer checking beerjs
[12:38:15] <Soothsayer> ok what's beerjs? :-P
[12:38:46] <ch3mical> jspeaks: hang on, side tracked
[12:41:28] <ketralnis> I'm sure this is simple but can't seem to find it. I have a dictionary {a: 1, b: 'foo bar', c: 3} and want to turn it into URL parameters like a=1&b=foo%20bar&c=3, Is there a function to do this?
[12:42:38] <Redoak> Could someone give me a hand with jQuery UI. I've used theme roller, downloaded my theme, linked to the appropriate jQuery scripts, the CSS file, and tried using it on a page but none of the CSS appears to be working. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
[12:45:26] <Vaerros> bah, looks like IE 6/7 doesn't support option[disabled], if I'm correct
[12:55:04] <Engin> adding, like 170, img elements kinda freezes IE UI for a while, my button click lags considerably amount of time
[12:55:09] <Engin> any suggestions ?
[12:55:29] <Engin> or should take the bullet and make a on-demand loading for that part, which kinda kills the whole point though :)
[12:56:48] <t4nkd> Mutiple rows in a vertical carousel is officially a poor decision -.-*
[13:00:07] <Whirl3d> here's an easy one...if I load content into a temporary div (inside it's final destination), can I then do $(finaldest).html($(finaldest).find(".temp").hmtl());  or will I have garbage collection issues?
[13:03:05] <Whirl3d> ketranis, you may be looking for $.map, but it's probably just as easy to write it out like: for (var prop in array) {url+=prop+":"+array[prop]};   basically.
[13:03:35] <Whirl3d> *: =
[13:04:54] <Whirl3d> Where all the peeps at up in here?
[13:05:51] <fist> hey, whats the right syntax for this expression: $("button.citationCorrect|button.citationError").click(function() { return false; });
[13:06:00] <fist> i would like to express an OR
[13:06:02] <BlackArts> Hi, is there someone who knows how to properly call json with ajax?
[13:06:13] <BlackArts> I'm having some trouble
[13:06:53] <BlackArts> I simply can't get json file no matter what I try. Here's the page: http://kululush.com/secret/
[13:07:09] <BlackArts> If someone could take a look, that would be great
[13:07:38] <Whirl3d> ? or
[13:08:25] <TonkaTruck> fist: You should have a citation class or something.  Then class="citation correct" and class="citation error" etc
[13:09:13] <Whirl3d> wasn't sure if "or" was a selector option or not....first, try var btn=$("button.citationCorrect")||$("button.citationError); btn.click(handler);
[13:10:38] <Voziv> BlackArts: you're missing a }
[13:11:01] <BlackArts> That's most reacent version, but it didn't work anyway
[13:11:21] <Whirl3d> if I load content into a temporary div (inside it's final destination), can I then do $(finaldest).html($(finaldest).find(".temp").hmtl());  or will I have garbage collection issues?
[13:12:04] <fist> TonkaTruck: how does the or expression then looks like?
[13:12:33] <TonkaTruck> button.citation are the same css except for properties overloaded by button.citation.error {} and button.citation.correct {}.  Then $("button.citation") applies to all citation buttons.
[13:12:35] <Whirl3d> $(".citation").click(handler);
[13:12:37] <v0lZy> Hello
[13:12:56] <Whirl3d> Hello v0lZy
[13:13:10] <fist> TonkaTruck: ok i try it out
[13:13:10] <v0lZy> I'd like to ask for some assisstance with the fadeIn and fadeOut calls.
[13:13:17] <v0lZy> Hello Whirl3d
[13:13:23] <BlackArts> mmm... I've added } but I still get json = null
[13:13:27] <ch3mical> Just ask
[13:13:28] <Whirl3d> just ask
[13:13:30] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:13:47] <v0lZy> I have this problem I dont know how to solve... I'll describe first and if i dont get it accross, ill try to fiddle it
[13:14:01] <v0lZy> The thing is, I'm making a slideshow presentation
[13:14:36] <BlackArts> Ok... I'm pulling my hair out! Man, I can't get this stupid json file load into html file for like 3 days, can anyone assist me a little with this?
[13:14:44] <BlackArts> here's the page
[13:14:44] <fist> TonkaTruck: thank you
[13:14:45] <BlackArts> http://kululush.com/secret/
[13:14:52] <Voziv> BlackArts: json isn't accessible from inside the function
[13:14:56] <v0lZy> basically, its done like this <div><a></a></div> where a's height and width are 100%. The div's (1 for each slide) are positioned relative inside a parent div that has overflow:hidden. They are all positioned horizontally one after another
[13:15:01] <TonkaTruck> Just my advice.  Otherwise you have this mess of .citationError and .citationSuccess, etc...when really those mean .citation.error and .citation.success, etc.  Remember that the space means everything.  ".citation .success" is success inside of citation whereas ".citation.success" is citation AND success.
[13:15:22] <v0lZy> Since a inside each div cvovers the full area of its parent, u can click anywhere on the slide and it slides to the next anchor
[13:15:25] <v0lZy> so its like
[13:15:34] <v0lZy> #Slide1 #Slide2, #Slide3 etc
[13:16:09] <BlackArts> ?
[13:16:16] <ch3mical> Or you could just bind a click even to the div itself... just sayin
[13:16:16] <BlackArts> what do you mean?
[13:16:22] <v0lZy> Now I have the scrolling working.. when i click Slide1, it scrolls to the left, and Slide2 shows.. i click slide2, slide3 shows.. .and when i click slide3 (last slide) it rewinds back to Slide1
[13:16:34] <cowwoc> hi
[13:16:41] <v0lZy> I am atempting to combine this with fadeIn and fadOu
[13:17:18] <ch3mical> Croatian, eh?
[13:17:24] <BlackArts> yep
[13:17:30] <Whirl3d> BlackArts, you should look into $.map....it might help
[13:17:39] <v0lZy> In such a way, that when I click on the first slide, the second slide goes like Slide2.fadeOut(0) and right after that, Slide2.fadeIn(800)
[13:17:41] <v0lZy> This all works fine
[13:17:48] <cowwoc> How do I get the Slider widget to use a fixed width instead of a full line? By default it uses a <div> which eats up the entire line. Is float:left really the way to go? I want the follow: [label] [slider] [spinner] and I want the slider to eat up any space left over by the label or spinner. Any ideas?
[13:17:57] <BlackArts> what's the reverse function of json stringify?
[13:18:09] <v0lZy> but, im bothered by the fact that when i go from Slide3, rewinding back to Slide1, I see Slide2 scroll by
[13:18:21] <TheWarden> Hi. I'm using jQuery UI autocomplete, I have it going to MySQL for an id and value. When the value is selected it populates into a select option, the value goes in ui.item.value, how to I reference the id I got from MySQL?
[13:18:34] <BlackArts> JSON.parse XD
[13:18:38] <v0lZy> So I'm looking for a way, to "hide" slide1 when I move from slide1 to slide2 .. and hide slide2 when i move from slide2 o slide3
[13:18:56] <v0lZy> so that when i rewind from Slide3 to Slide1, I dont see Slide2 fly past
[13:19:12] <Whirl3d> BlackArts, this may be crazy, but could it be your $(document).ready() {function....
[13:19:15] <v0lZy> For the love of god,  cant achieve this
[13:19:29] <TheWarden> I store the data from MySQL like so in a while loop, $friends[$x] = array("id" => $row->id, "name" => $row->Name);
[13:19:39] <BlackArts> no, I'm not doing anything with it
[13:19:40] <ch3mical> v0lZy: see ?hide()
[13:19:53] <v0lZy> ?hide()
[13:19:56] <ch3mical> Damn you bot
[13:19:59] <TheWarden> in JavaScript how to I refer to the id to get the value of that? I'm only getting the name value doing ui.item.value ??
[13:20:05] <ch3mical> v0lZy: .hide()
[13:20:15] <v0lZy> ch3mical: let me try it
[13:20:31] <Kambfhase> TheWarden: try ui.item.id
[13:20:57] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: I did and it is undefined when I do an alert(ui.item.id)
[13:21:13] <Kambfhase> what is ui.item then?
[13:22:08] <v0lZy> It doesnt work ch3mical
[13:22:22] <v0lZy> ch3mical: Perhaps I can fiddle this, hold on
[13:23:10] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: take a look http://pastebin.com/XqX2cDSH
[13:23:29] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: look under select:
[13:24:45] <BlackArts> Argh! Why am I getting this stupid error, I've managed to get json as string, but It won't parse when I traj jsonParse function
[13:24:47] <BlackArts> http://kululush.com/secret/
[13:24:51] <BlackArts> anyone?
[13:26:07] <Kambfhase> TheWarden: well you could try $(ui.item).attr('id') bu i doubt that will help
[13:26:47] <Kambfhase> BlackArts: you keys must be in double qoutes! "
[13:27:02] <BlackArts> smack! (on my head)
[13:27:10] <Kambfhase> BlackArts: use http://jsonlint.com/ to validate you JSON
[13:27:21] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: yeah undefined is what I get. am I storing the multiple values wrong to then be able to reference it in JavaScript?
[13:28:19] <v0lZy> damn jsfiddle html is hard to edit, it drops my indents :|
[13:29:33] <v0lZy> ch3mical: Whirl3d : i got it fiddled
[13:29:35] <v0lZy> http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/1/
[13:29:54] <v0lZy> if you click "tttttttt' it takes you to the next slide
[13:29:59] <v0lZy> and if u click the next one, u go to slide3
[13:30:15] <v0lZy> and if u click slide3 it rewinds back to slide1 (but notice how u can see slide2 flash by)
[13:30:51] <v0lZy> I would like to fadeOut slide2 when i click on it
[13:31:18] <v0lZy> so that it fadesOut and scrolls (simillar as how it fadesIn and scrolls)
[13:31:34] <v0lZy> So that when i rewind from Slide3 to Slide1, It wond fly by
[13:31:56] <v0lZy> Can you help me achieve that please?
[13:32:08] <v0lZy> I've tried everything I can think of, it just doesn work or prevents me from clicking stuff
[13:33:11] <v0lZy> I think the problem is because its asynchronus
[13:33:17] <v0lZy> but I dont know really
[13:33:19] <v0lZy> or how to solve it
[13:33:43] <Kambfhase> v0lZy: you could do visibility: hidden on your slide 2
[13:33:46] <Voziv> BlackArts: you should also note that your layout is absolutely useless for anyone with a screen width under 1280, and even 1280 it limits you quite a bit
[13:34:08] <v0lZy> Kambfhase: I'd like for it to fade if possible
[13:34:09] <tehOPEologist> hey all, could someone help me make these carousel images linkable?  http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/
[13:35:12] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: the strange this is in source: I can do val.id and val.name just fine mmm
[13:35:36] <Voziv> tehOPEologist: what images?
[13:35:54] <v0lZy> I tried with $(lasSlide).fadeOut(300); a the top
[13:36:02] <v0lZy> but that has some weird results
[13:36:22] <tehOPEologist> Voziv, on the carousel above the header nav bar
[13:36:24] <Kambfhase> TheWarden: is it online?
[13:36:52] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: no it's not. I can post the friends.php (data source) and the javascript to a pastebin
[13:36:56] <Kambfhase> v0lZy: fade out then, and as soon as thats done, set visibility o hidden
[13:37:14] <v0lZy> I meant $('#' + lastSlide).fadeOut(300); sorry.
[13:37:27] <tehOPEologist> Voziv, i tried replacing img in my Query to a, but it doesn't work the way you'd think it would, lol
[13:37:34] <Kambfhase> TheWarden: make a fiddle with you HTML,Css+Js, please: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:37:50] <v0lZy> Kambfhase: check out what happens with fadeOut: http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/3/
[13:38:06] <v0lZy> compared to http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/1/
[13:38:24] <v0lZy> It goes to shit when I click the second slide
[13:38:37] <v0lZy> and doesnt allow me to rewind
[13:39:35] <airstrike> i have <select id="myselect"><option value>---</option><option value="1" selected="selected">one</option></select> how can i get which option is selected?
[13:40:04] <cboyce> airstrike, does .val() give you what you want?
[13:40:09] <airstrike> no
[13:40:19] <airstrike> i have more than one option with values, so i can't trust that
[13:40:37] <djQuery> airstrike $('#selectid>option:selected')
[13:40:38] <tmayr> airstrike: do $('select').find('option:selected')
[13:40:45] <airstrike> find, thanks =)
[13:40:47] <airstrike> too many methods...
[13:41:00] <v0lZy> Kambfhase: see what i mean? http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/1/   Vs. http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/3/
[13:41:04] <airstrike> and i never remember option:selected
[13:41:06] <airstrike> that kind of syntax
[13:41:20] <Kambfhase> yeah, dunno
[13:41:33] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: well I posted it but it doesn't work as I'm using a PHP file to fetch data from MySQL then returning the results JSON array
[13:41:37] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/kkWne/
[13:41:39] <djQuery> psuedo selectors
[13:41:47] <cboyce> I'm trying to add the ability to toggle (unselect) a radio button, however calling .attr("checked") or .is("checked") always returns true
[13:41:50] <Kambfhase> airstrike: dont worry, thats what we get pay for.
[13:42:04] <djQuery> Kambfhase: paid?
[13:42:06] <v0lZy> ch3mical: Perhaps you have an idea? http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/1/   Vs. http://jsfiddle.net/KxDvC/3/
[13:42:28] <TheWarden> Kambfhase: doing this on the field Channel filter autocomplete which then when selected sends the value to channels selected need id and value to pop in the item.
[13:42:34] <cboyce> Any thoughts on how I'd go about toggling a radio button?
[13:42:53] <Kambfhase> djQuery: just kidding ;)
[13:43:24] <djQuery> dangit
[13:43:25] <tmayr> djQuery: you're not getting paid?, im loving my juicy check every month
[13:43:29] <Kambfhase> cboyce: try .prop()
[13:43:37] <tmayr> :p
[13:44:01] <v0lZy> Kambfhase: Do you think my issue is because its asynchronus? as in the value of lastSlide changes before the animation is over
[13:44:11] <v0lZy> and hence, the third slide is removed?
[13:44:21] <ch3mical> v0lZy: I don't think you can do it using the method you currently have
[13:44:39] <ch3mical> v0lZy: you need a way to identify each slide individually
[13:44:47] <v0lZy> ch3mical: :(
[13:44:58] <v0lZy> Why isnt this working?
[13:45:13] <v0lZy> I mean... each slide has its own anchorname
[13:45:21] <v0lZy> thats what Id them by... this.href
[13:45:34] <ch3mical> I would do something like.... (give me a min)
[13:46:40] <airstrike> Kambfhase: i know, i just got a raise from #django
[13:46:41] <v0lZy> ok, ill wait
[13:46:42] <airstrike> =)
[13:47:47] <tmayr> hah
[13:47:52] <cboyce> Kambfhase: prop() is still returning true whether or not the radio is selected before clicking on it
[13:47:59] <cboyce> (I'm doing prop("checked")
[13:48:46] <joikus> wow i still cant find a nice file uploader
[13:48:47] <Kambfhase> ?val @ cboyce
[13:48:56] <tmayr> cboyce: cant you use is('checked')?
[13:49:12] <Kambfhase> joikus: jQuery is not a file uploader ;)
[13:49:48] <cboyce>  Kambfhase: val gives me the radio value, not whether or not a particluar one is checked. I want the user to be able to click on a selected radio button to unselect it
[13:50:07] <cboyce>  tmayr: .is(":checked") always returns true when clicking on a radio button
[13:50:19] <tmayr> hm
[13:50:19] <tmayr> sec
[13:50:24] <joikus> kambfhase ya iknow :p
[13:50:28] <Kambfhase> that is not the behaviour of a radio bottun. do you want a checkbox?
[13:50:59] <cboyce>  Kambfhase: No, the user selects between 3 options, or leaves it blank. They're not required
[13:51:16] <AdamDV> How can I have an element fade to an opacity?
[13:51:38] <tmayr> use animate({'opacity', value})
[13:51:41] <cboyce> usability aside, this is a feature request, not a new UI, so I " just need to make it work"
[13:52:34] <DannyZB> I embedded a video into a webpage using quicktime .. and for some reason it opens up windows media player instead
[13:52:42] <DannyZB> what can cause such behaviour
[13:52:44] <cboyce> It sounds like there's not an easy way, so I'll just kludge something in. I mostly wanted to make sure I wasn't missing somtehing obvious
[13:52:51] <Kambfhase> cboyce: use :selected or something like that then.
[13:53:12] <v0lZy> quicktime, eeew
[13:53:24] <DannyZB> guys .. maybe you have a better alternative
[13:53:33] <DannyZB> I want a universal media player to embed in my pages
[13:53:39] <DannyZB> no weird mixes of different player
[13:53:40] <DannyZB> s
[13:53:41] <Kambfhase> DannyZB: use flash then
[13:53:53] <DannyZB> I can't .. file conversion is too heavy for my servers
[13:53:56] <cboyce> Doesn't look like :selected works on radio buttons, :checked does thou
[13:54:13] <DannyZB> I thought about WMP but that would leave linux out
[13:54:20] <Kambfhase> cboyce: selected works on the options.
[13:54:33] <v0lZy> html5 has native video....
[13:54:49] <DannyZB> that would leave 60% of the users out lol
[13:54:52] <systemfault> But unusable in the real world.
[13:54:55] <systemfault> DannyZB++
[13:55:28] <DannyZB> so what do you suggest ? and whats wrong with quicktime?
[13:55:29] <v0lZy> outsorce then :/
[13:55:32] <systemfault> Flash is still the best for videos.
[13:55:33] <Suikwan> Need help with some jquery 1.6 code at http://jsfiddle.net/bSuxE/  Any help appreciated.
[13:55:52] <DannyZB> I'm thinking about using VLC .. but I would need to fix their embedding code - super unstable
[13:55:53] <Kambfhase> DannyZB: It is not a matter of Program its am matter of which file format you use.
[13:56:20] <DannyZB> I'm building a file-storage service .. video playback is a bonus feature .. I can't put too much money on it
[13:56:21] <airstrike> okay, so *how* do i select <options> in a <select>?
[13:57:06] <Kambfhase> airstrike: $('the path to you select > here').children('option')
[13:57:16] <tmayr> airstrike: same way, find value, set attr selected
[13:57:18] <DannyZB> I'm thinking about forking VLC to act as a standalone embaddable video player
[13:57:39] <systemfault> Or just use flash..
[13:57:56] <airstrike> setting attr selected isn't working for me
[13:58:08] <tmayr> try attr('selected', 'selected')
[13:58:09] <DannyZB> "just" = loads of money
[13:58:25] <Suikwan> Kambfhase, I too and trying to select an <option> from a <select>, however, I am tryint to select based on the text.  my code is at http://jsfiddle.net/bSuxE/
[13:58:40] <airstrike> tmayr: doesn't work
[13:58:45] <v0lZy> DannyZB: quicktime.. might as well go with realplayer... noone uses these 2 anymore
[13:58:48] <AdamDV> tmayr: $("img.logo").animate({'opacity', '1'}); doesnt work
[13:58:51] <tmayr> airstrike: give me a sec
[13:58:52] <tehOPEologist> hey all, could someone help me make these carousel images linkable?  http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/
[13:58:58] <tehOPEologist> please?
[13:59:00] <airstrike> yes it does
[13:59:01] <airstrike> tmayr: it worked
[13:59:07] <DannyZB> say I use WMP10 ... is there something that linux supports as well?
[13:59:07] <tmayr> airstrike: :D
[13:59:08] <tehOPEologist> i've tried changing img to a in my jQuery, but it doesn't work :(
[13:59:12] <tmayr> AdamDV: is the element hidden beforehand?
[13:59:13] <Kambfhase> Suikwan: and whats the problem?
[13:59:14] <DannyZB> IE one player for linux one for windows
[13:59:28] <airstrike> :D
[13:59:29] <tmayr> AdamDV: also if you want to go from 0 to 1, try fadeIn(speed) (speed in ms)
[13:59:32] <airstrike> but something else is off..
[13:59:34] <Kambfhase> DannyZB: and what about mac?
[13:59:39] <AdamDV> tmayr: I'll pastebin it
[13:59:43] <tmayr> kk
[13:59:46] <tmayr> jsfiddle it
[13:59:50] <tmayr> jsfiddle.net
[13:59:53] <Kambfhase> DannyZB: and about iOS? and BCD? and ...
[13:59:53] <DannyZB> mac .. well heh .. quicktime
[13:59:58] <DannyZB> and
[13:59:58] <Suikwan> Kambfhase the show command works but the code to select the desired option does not
[13:59:59] <djQuery> DannyZB: quickest way for people not to want to view your content. force them to install a stupid plugin like qt or rp
[14:00:00] <AdamDV> tmayr: http://pastebin.com/gt9DJkC7
[14:00:02] <airstrike> something in my code is breaking the regular 'selected' attr setting..
[14:00:06] <airstrike> so i wonder if i'm going to have to set it again
[14:00:27] <DannyZB> djQuery: if I use quicktime for mac and MediaPlayer for windows they wouldn't have to install anything
[14:00:30] <v0lZy> I run from websites that have quicktime
[14:00:35] <v0lZy> NEver liked installing it
[14:00:48] <tmayr> AdamDV: maybe im missing the speed, try adding like, 500 after }
[14:00:54] <DannyZB> question is whats the default linux media player?
[14:00:54] <v0lZy> I totally hated those games that needed quicktime installed
[14:00:55] <tmayr> so '1'},500
[14:01:19] <v0lZy> DannyZB: linux is like 2% of all the computer users
[14:01:21] * AdamDV reads animate() doc
[14:01:24] <djQuery> how about the html5 video and or adio tag with fallbacks incase the browser dont support it
[14:01:26] <v0lZy> perhaps more if you count android in
[14:01:40] <airstrike> tmayr: is there a way to tell which option was selected from whithin a .change() function?
[14:01:45] <DannyZB> I'm a big open-source guy .. never going to leave linux out forget about it heh
[14:01:46] <airstrike> i need to set 'selected' manually
[14:01:58] <v0lZy> But people in linux (i use linux) ... noone has a default program :D I use the weirdest shit out there.
[14:02:03] <DannyZB> Android ? what player does it have anyway?
[14:02:25] <tmayr> airstrike: you can do inside that change $(this).val() i think
[14:02:26] <Kambfhase> Suikwan: your problem is that $('#equip1 option[text~="Alcatel"]') does not wselect the elements you want
[14:02:27] <v0lZy> Also... iPad doesnt have flash etc..
[14:02:31] <v0lZy> I dont know, you should go html5
[14:02:41] <AdamDV> got it working :P
[14:02:47] <DannyZB> html5 doesn't have enough formats
[14:02:55] <DannyZB> I don't allow format conversion
[14:03:04] <airstrike> tmayr: <3
[14:03:06] <Kambfhase> yes it does, h.264 and OGG
[14:03:09] <DannyZB> all data needs to be directly accessible and unedited
[14:03:10] <v0lZy> DannyZB: Afriad you cant caer everyone with just 1 format then...
[14:03:15] <v0lZy> ogg is a great format
[14:03:30] <v0lZy> cater*
[14:03:43] <Kambfhase> ?contains @ Suikwan
[14:03:51] <Suikwan> Kambfhase yes, I would like the option with the word Alcatel in it to be selected
[14:04:13] <Suikwan> Kambfhase contains...is that a selector?
[14:04:21] <DannyZB> Again .. I 'll explain the idea : I'm building a free file storage service where all content is directly accessible ( opened in a facebox ) - I push in loads of viewers
[14:04:28] <Kambfhase> yes, looks like the bots down though.
[14:04:36] <DannyZB> The idea is that the content is exactly what the user uploads
[14:04:46] <Kambfhase> Suikwan: http://jsfiddle.net/bSuxE/1/
[14:04:51] <DannyZB> untouched .. I need to support as many formats as possible
[14:05:06] <v0lZy> DannyZB: and u wan them to say, upload an avi, and have a chance to preview it?
[14:05:12] <DannyZB> exactly!
[14:05:18] <Rafalski> question for u guys.. i have a checkbox, and when clicked on it hides the current div it's in, but, when u click on it, it doesn't change state to clicked.. how do i do it so it shows it's clicked before hiding?
[14:05:45] <Suikwan> Kambfhase did it work for you on jsfiddle? it doesnt for me
[14:05:54] <DannyZB> I'm trying to push the limits here .. seriously thinking about looking for guys to help make a new VLC-based plugin
[14:06:10] <Kambfhase> Suikwan: delet the console.log( line then.
[14:06:57] <v0lZy> DannyZB: thats truely ambitious
[14:06:59] <Suikwan> Kambfhase thanks a lot for the help
[14:07:00] <AzaToth> you think we coud use jquery here? :)  http://bellard.org/jslinux/index.html
[14:07:11] <ravenzz> Rafalski i suppose you should use change() insteadof click
[14:07:12] <v0lZy> and as far as VLC goes... good idea, but most people dont have it installed i think.
[14:07:12] <Kambfhase> doubt it
[14:07:34] <drMike_> hello
[14:07:34] <DannyZB> think about it .. a true opensource video-embed plugin based on jQuery + VLC code (no player installed - independent plugin)
[14:07:52] <Rafalski> ravenzz: that's the trick. huge thanks!
[14:07:56] <v0lZy> If you're gonna force people to use a certain plugin, i think VLC is a good choice... but you might as well force them to update your browser
[14:08:18] <v0lZy> you're gonna get into lots of issues if the VLC plugin wont work for opera.. or on mac.... or in ie 6 etc etc
[14:08:23] <drMike_> could someone please let me know if the JS listed here is wrong: https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/wiki/Callbacks
[14:08:24] <AdamDV> So, I have a <div> that has a background image. I'm looking to make that background image scroll horizontally like a slideshow.
[14:08:27] <AdamDV> How do I do that?
[14:08:27] <Kambfhase> Suikwan: do you self a favor and read: fixingthesejquery.com
[14:08:35] <v0lZy> so... I think it boils down to HTML5 again... people will update sooner or later.
[14:08:40] <DannyZB> thats the thing .. the plugin already exists .. it's just unstable and requires VLC installed
[14:08:46] <v0lZy> and its not like you kill their experience
[14:08:54] <AzaToth> DannyZB: just take jslinux, install mplayer onto it and you'r done 
[14:09:09] <v0lZy> in fact, you enhance their experience.... by making them update the browser, where theey get to experience all other pages better, and safer.
[14:09:10] <drMike_> for example, this afternoon .hide('slide', {direction: "left"}, 500, callback); was triggering errors in JQuery.js itself!
[14:09:14] <DannyZB> if we successfully make a plugin thats plug-and-play to users and direct use to admins I think it can catch on
[14:09:23] <DannyZB> no more flash workarounds
[14:09:29] <drMike_> I could only get it to work by setting it as .hide('slide', callback);
[14:09:36] <v0lZy> It would catch on if it was bundled with firefox or something
[14:09:47] <drMike_> Even .hide('slide', {}, 500, callback); wouldn't work
[14:09:47] <drMike_> any ideas?
[14:09:50] <DannyZB> it doesnt have to be .. I can upload it to the firefox addons library
[14:09:54] <v0lZy> I am very very very very causcous about installing plugins...
[14:09:57] <DannyZB> then its auto-install
[14:10:00] <Suikwan> Kambfhase thanks again
[14:10:03] <v0lZy> I keep flash and adobe installed... and thats... hey, what about adobe?
[14:10:05] <drMike_> hello?
[14:10:15] <v0lZy> i think it can embed video into documents.
[14:10:27] <ravenzz> ..
[14:10:30] <DannyZB> I never said it's gonna be easy .. but it can be huge if I get this to work
[14:10:34] <DannyZB> worth the effort
[14:10:39] <ravenzz> v0lZy what's the matter?
[14:10:41] <v0lZy> auto install on firefox, yes, but what about chrome, safari, ie
[14:10:53] * drMike_ feels left out...
[14:10:53] <DannyZB> chrome -> get it on the google addons library
[14:10:58] <drMike_> oh well.
[14:11:08] <Kambfhase> drMike_: are yyou sure you installed the plugin properly + it gets loaded?
[14:11:12] <AzaToth> drMike_: are you using latest version?
[14:11:12] <DannyZB> explorer -> add a link .. but I hate explorer anyway .. it's anti-progress
[14:11:24] <drMike_> Kambfhase: yes.
[14:11:46] <drMike_> I used the rails javascript tag to load :all rather than :defaults too
[14:12:18] <DannyZB> anyway guys thanks for the info .. DZB is out
[14:12:23] <drMike_> and checked for the scripts.  The callback did trigger alert("blah"); for example
[14:12:49] <Kambfhase> drMike_: is you site online?
[14:13:48] <drMike_> Kambfhase: was running locally in dev mode
[14:13:57] <drMike_> but the code I was using for the callback is identical to the one I linked
[14:14:08] <drMike_> Kambfhase:  https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/wiki/Callbacks
[14:14:09] <Kambfhase> drMike_: make sure jQueryUI is loaded. other wise this will not work
[14:14:25] <drMike_> any particular test for it?
[14:14:39] <drMike_> I could see the jquery-ui.js listed?
[14:15:07] <drMike_> Even .effect( effect, [options], [speed], [callback] ) << was causing #object errors saying 'effect' wasn't an available method
[14:15:20] <drMike_> I was trying to trigger a simple highlight
[14:16:28] <Kambfhase> well there must be something being loaded wrong somewhere.  check if you use the latest jQuery + UI.
[14:16:45] <Kambfhase> otherwise i cant debug it from here.
[14:16:50] <drMike_> one sec
[14:16:57] <tmayr> airstrike: fixed your issue?
[14:16:59] <rns> I need a way to display read only data in an excel like spreadsheet that fills the entire window.  Any good solutions for this out there?
[14:17:22] <innociv> When someone types a space in an input how would I replace it with an underscore?
[14:17:37] <tmayr> catch that keypress
[14:17:44] <tmayr> http://api.jquery.com/keypress
[14:17:57] <innociv> I started with a bind on keyup, no idea where else to go
[14:18:20] <tmayr> then do if(event.which = (space char code)){}
[14:18:30] <tmayr> == i mean
[14:19:25] <tmayr> AdamDV: got that pastebin again? or you fixed your issue?
[14:19:31] <AdamDV> fixed it :)
[14:19:46] <innociv> but how do i then place an underscore at the carret?
[14:19:57] <tmayr> innociv: sec
[14:20:10] <F1skr> what kind of selector is this: $("li", "#id") i can't figure out how it is supposed to work (found in a plugin)
[14:20:35] <airstrike> tmayr: not really
[14:20:37] <airstrike> but time's up
[14:20:42] <airstrike> have to be at my MBA in 10'
[14:20:47] <tmayr> oh :P
[14:20:50] <airstrike> i'll be back tomorrow and bother you guys again if i can't figure it out =)
[14:20:57] <tmayr> throw me a query if you need more help with it
[14:21:14] <airstrike> will do, thanks a gazillion
[14:21:32] <innociv> Do dashes not work in input name attributes?  $("input[name=tag-name]") doesn't seem to work
[14:21:38] <innociv> nevermind it does..
[14:22:47] <tmayr> innociv
[14:22:47] <tmayr> http://jsfiddle.net/gMhdQ/
[14:23:04] <innociv> The problem is that won't insert it at the carret
[14:23:07] <innociv> it'll insert it at the end
[14:23:36] <tmayr> what? you said you needed _ instead of space, thats what that fiddle does
[14:23:57] <innociv> tmayr, if you try to add a space at the middle that'll add it at the end..
[14:24:00] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1064089/inserting-a-text-where-cursor-is-using-javascript-jquery I guess I have to use this.
[14:24:19] <tmayr> ohhh
[14:24:20] <tmayr> hm
[14:24:20] <innociv> But...
[14:24:27] <innociv> that has an ugly selector.
[14:25:59] <tmayr> innociv: yeah not sure how i would handle that, didnt notice that haha
[14:27:00] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1064089/inserting-a-text-where-cursor-is-using-javascript-jquery/4384173#4384173 doesn't seem to work for me either..

[14:31:28] <sero|work> may have to jsfiddle this one
[14:32:59] <ravenzz> innociv if you click on a link you don't have a focus anymore
[14:33:26] <innociv> I wasn't clicking a link?

[14:35:30] <drMike_> Kambfhase: copying  jQuery (1.6.1) and copying  jQuery UI (1.8.12)
[14:35:36] <Wulf> Hello
[14:36:45] <ibc> hi, let me a question please:
[14:37:14] <Wulf> I've just started using jquery. If I append some elements with $("#xy").after("something"); why are the css attributes not used? If I write "something" directly in html, it works as expected.
[14:37:38] <tmayr> Wulf: after places something OUTSIDE #xy
[14:37:45] <tmayr> if you want it inside, use .append
[14:38:19] <ibc> I set .keypress for a text input, so after pressing a key in the input a function checks if such input is now empty or not. However the problem is that the function evaluates the input value before it's updated!
[14:38:25] <Wulf> tmayr: thanks! :-)
[14:39:54] <ibc> so, for example the input is empty, I write "a" into it and keypress() event is called. It evaluates the value o the input. I expect it nows gets "a" but instead it gets "" (empty). This is, it gets the value before pressing a new key
[14:40:08] <ibc> is there some solution for this? thanks a lot
[14:41:10] <ravenzz> ibc keyup
[14:41:22] <ibc> oh, so easy :)
[14:41:26] <ibc> thanks a lot!
[14:41:33] <ravenzz> np
[14:41:59] <ibc> yeah, it works :)  thanks again
[14:45:01] <Phoenixz> I want to erase the text of a textarea, I thought I could do that with $(textarea).empty(); but that doesnt seem to work. What should I do?
[14:45:35] <ryanneufed> $(textarea).html("");
[14:46:05] <Phoenixz> ryanneufed: will try, but just so I understand.. why is empty() not working here?
[14:46:16] <ryanneufed> dunno
[14:46:24] <ryanneufed> prolly cause it's a text area
[14:46:29] <ryanneufed> which is a special case
[14:46:31] <ryanneufed> I could be wrong
[14:46:38] <ryanneufed> but .html(""); should work
[14:46:47] <ryanneufed> ?val
[14:47:07] <ryanneufed> hmm. no bot-t
[14:48:51] <ryanneufed> Also .val() should work on a text area
[14:49:23] <ryanneufed> Phoenixz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3729828/jquery-clear-textarea-on-focus
[14:49:25] <Phoenixz> ryanneufed: hey.. still not working.. tried alert($(textarea).html()); and shows no text, but the textarea still has the text..
[14:49:36] <ryanneufed> try .val()
[14:49:43] <fandango> .val()  works on textareas
[14:49:50] <fandango> i've used it like 10000 times
[14:49:58] <ryanneufed> I've used it before too
[14:50:04] <ryanneufed> dunno why I thought to use html()
[14:50:05] <fandango> sorry for jumping in discussion
[14:50:07] <ryanneufed> mea culpa
[14:50:11] <ryanneufed> don't be
[14:50:15] <ryanneufed> that's the ponit of IRC
[14:50:20] <ryanneufed> point even
[14:50:34] <ravenzz> Phoenixz empty "Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM"
[14:50:44] <fandango> i just joined so i didnt know what was th problem with .val since i've used it since i've starter working with jq
[14:51:20] <Phoenixz> ravenzz: from the jquery documentation page: This method removes not only child (and other descendant) elements, but also any text within the set of matched elements. This is because, according to the DOM specification, any string of text within an element is considered a child node of that element.
[14:51:38] <Phoenixz> Anyway, .val() does seem to work..
[14:51:48] <ravenzz> ok but
[14:51:56] <ravenzz> any text within the set of matched elements
[14:52:35] <ravenzz> has to be intended as textNode
[14:52:40] <ravenzz> not as value
[14:53:49] <ravenzz> intended? lol from italian to english
[14:54:19] <ravenzz> anyway val is what you need
[14:54:43] <Phoenixz> .val() does the trick yeah
[14:57:01] <ibc> hi, is there any way to check if an element has been pressed with the pointer for more than N seconds?
[14:58:20] <ibc> maybe it could be done manually by setting a time_start when mousedown and check the elapsed time when mouseup, is it? thanks a lot
[14:59:14] <ravenzz> i think that's the way
[14:59:34] <ibc> thanks
[15:14:53] <sgrover> Looking for ideas.  Have a textbox that has a value="1" set, but shows NOTHING in the textbox.  Not a case of font color hiding the value.  Occurs in both FF and Chrome... WTF is my reaction...
[15:15:54] <snover> sgrover: text <input> or <textarea> ?
[15:16:01] <sgrover> caveats for this problem - value is set via jQuery (version 1.3.2), in a Zend Framework app (version 1.8)
[15:16:04] <sgrover> snover: input
[15:16:56] <BinaryKitten> 1) what has that to do with jQuery
[15:17:05] <BinaryKitten> 2) why are you using 1.8 and not 1.11?
[15:17:16] <coldhead> BK <3
[15:17:19] <sgrover> Oh, the input box is in a jQuery.UI dialog (1.72)
[15:17:25] <BinaryKitten> 3) any reason you are still using 1.3.2?
[15:17:37] <BinaryKitten> 4) which version of ui are you linking to
[15:17:41] <sgrover> BinaryKitten: you are not being helpful in anyway.  If I COULD be using later versions I would.
[15:18:06] <BinaryKitten> sgrover of course i'm not being helpful..
[15:18:15] <BinaryKitten> i can't be helpful without further information
[15:18:19] <sgrover> The fact the data is put into the Input via jQuery, on a jQuery Dialog, makes this related to jQuery.
[15:18:28] <BinaryKitten> the questions were my attempt to get the infomation to try to be helpful.
[15:18:29] <snover> wat?
[15:19:22] <sgrover> sorry if I'm being snippy.
[15:19:33] <snover> ?p @ sgrover
[15:19:42] <snover> oh right, bot-t is dead
[15:19:56] <BinaryKitten> sgrover it's late and i can understand
[15:20:07] <snover> sgrover: paste to http://jsfiddle.net your code
[15:20:15] <BinaryKitten> sometimes i have to ask the most stupid questions to illiminate them
[15:20:51] <lisak> how do you deal with multiple argument when using trigger ?
[15:21:11] <BinaryKitten> lisak place them in an array
[15:21:23] <croby> lisak: as an array - $(window).trigger("eventname", [arg1, arg2, ...]);
[15:21:33] <BinaryKitten> just like croby said
[15:21:45] <lisak> but [arg1, arg2, ...] is then within one parameter in handler
[15:21:53] <croby> no, its multiple
[15:22:03] <sgrover> snover: we're trying to figure out where it comes from first.  We do have code that sets .val(""), but that should set the value="".  But that is only on initializing the dialog
[15:22:05] <lisak> I'm using the widget's _trigger
[15:22:06] <croby> the handler would look like $(window).bind("eventname", event, arg1, arg2, ...);
[15:22:07] <lisak> and it is not
[15:22:24] <lisak> yep, and all [arg1, arg2, ...]  are in arg1
[15:22:35] <croby> no, they should be their own argumetns
[15:22:38] <croby> *arguments
[15:22:42] <snover> sgrover: I dont like fishing :)
[15:22:54] <sgrover> sry, we're working on it.
[15:22:54] <KWhat_Work> What is the _trigger function in the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/raw/master/ui/jquery.ui.progressbar.js source code?
[15:23:18] <BinaryKitten> sgrover it won't actually chnge the source..
[15:23:23] <gnarf> KWhat_Work: inherited from widget
[15:23:27] <BinaryKitten> it will only update the property
[15:23:32] <BinaryKitten> .val that is
[15:23:57] <gnarf> KWhat_Work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L344
[15:24:08] <fist> hey, does jquery ui has such notification? http://demo.vaadin.com/sampler#NotificationHumanized
[15:24:18] <fructose> I have a parent->child div structure and I'd like to hide the parent if all the children are hidden. Is there a quick way to do that if you have one child ID? I know about the :visible selector, but don't know the right way to use it :-)
[15:24:23] <sgrover> If we remove the initialize line (.val("") ), the values show up right.  But the values are pasted in after the fact.  I suspect the dialog hide/show is at play here (i.e. value is hidden to begin with, just not properly rendered)
[15:24:37] <gnarf> fist: not builtin
[15:24:41] <fist> :/
[15:24:42] <lisak> I'm using  this jquery uploader https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload.js
[15:24:49] <sgrover> If that is the case, then I can point to the versions and possibly justify the month of effort to update everything.
[15:24:51] <lisak> and all those triggers don't work like that
[15:24:57] <gnarf> mekwall did a little notification plugin but it doesn't work exactly like that one
[15:25:24] <lisak> jqueryui 1.8.13, jquery 1.6.1
[15:25:37] <ajpiano> fist: someone built something on jquery ui that does that though, https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-notification
[15:25:54] <gnarf> fist: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-notification
[15:26:14] <KWhat_Work> gnarf: aahhhh i see, I was calling it on the wrong "this"
[15:28:32] <fist> it looks too thick for my purposes - and i do not really want to install extra addons on top of jUI .. but thank you anyway
[15:31:07] <lisak> this is the resulting method in jqueryui  callback.call( this.element[0], event, data )
[15:31:11] <lisak> where the data is array
[15:32:14] <ajpiano> fist: how is it too thick? and if you have UI, the whole POINT of having it is that you can have other components that are built on the widget factory
[15:32:28] <ajpiano> that will have the exact same API as existing widgets, tc.
[15:32:40] <BinaryKitten> lisak this is the difference between ui and regular jquery.
[15:32:47] <snover> ajpiano: sometimes the thick ones hurt too much
[15:32:53] <ajpiano> you'd know :D
[15:32:57] <BinaryKitten> ui is always a couple of steps behind on new usage :)
[15:36:19] <fist> ajpiano: i meant the amount of functionality
[15:36:46] <ajpiano> how so?
[15:37:04] <ajpiano> it lets you show notifications, and control the effects with which they're shown, and whether or not they're sticky
[15:38:04] <ajpiano> seems to do exactly the same thing as what you linked us to
[15:39:02] <fist> ye but the simple notification from my link can be implemented with some lines in jquery
[15:40:15] <fist> but basically you are right
[15:40:38] <ajpiano> of course, but then you'll want a feature and then your couple of lines of jquery will grow and etc etc etc.
[15:41:58] <snover> and then you will decide you actually need a toolkit that solves these issues and get frustrated
[15:42:08] <snover> and throw away a bunch of custom-written code
[15:42:16] <ryanneufed> anyone have a link for using ajax requested jquery templates?
[15:45:37] <sgrover> snover: thanks for the moral support.  We're trying a quick test to see if the newer jQuery and UI resolves our issues.
[15:54:08] <iWaffles> is there a way to call the last element and loop through each of it's children?
[15:55:04] <strike-> I got these checkboxes working earlier by doing this a little bit differently, but I need it to be done this way http://jsfiddle.net/X6wZm/13/  (works not :P)
[15:55:35] <iWaffles> Ah, nvm
[15:58:04] * amid_hasan says hello
[16:08:21] <bradmaxs> anyone know any good tuts for a feedback button on the side of a browser.  I saw the contactable plugin but I am only in search of a window.  thaks
[16:08:26] <bradmaxs> thanks:)
[16:08:57] <ColKurtz> Any o fyou guys use YepNope.js?
[16:09:48] <coldhead> SlexAxton uses it
[16:16:05] <ColKurtz> coldhead, I was wondering if you could test for browser in test: with yepnope
[16:16:43] <ColKurtz> I know you can use the IE! prefixes to load files ONLY for internet explorer, but it would be useful if you could do it as a test case instead, so that you could do either/or (load a file or not load it)
[16:17:39] <ColKurtz> the reason is that Cufon has problems when loaded asychronously, so I would like to use IE conditionals to use standard <script> tags for jQuery/Cufon, and then use YepNope to test if the browser is IE, and if it's not then to load jquery/cufon itself
[16:17:54] <ColKurtz> Actually, I guess I could just test to see if jQuery is defined huh?
[16:27:12] <innociv> So.. I know I have 15 results, and I have 10 results per page.  That means I have 2 pages.  How do I actually get that 2 from 15?  Kind of trivial :/
[16:27:42] <strike-> Please guide me .. 99.8% of you guys knows instantly answer to my noob question. I'll paste again: http://jsfiddle.net/X6wZm/13/
[16:30:50] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/X6wZm/20/ You had so many errors..
[16:30:56] <innociv> it's name="" not name"".
[16:31:08] <innociv> . is not a attr selector
[16:31:17] <innociv> nor a checked selector
[16:31:26] <innociv> And slide up and down were reversed.
[16:37:06] <Hilikus> hey guys
[16:37:56] <Hilikus> i'm doing an ajax request and the response is a valid html document. i set dataType: "html" . now, how can i select somethign from the response? i want to extract <body> from the response
[16:38:13] <Hilikus> i tried $(response).$("body") but it doesnt work
[16:38:33] <Hilikus> i'm new to jquery. i know its a simple question
[16:42:51] <Hilikus> anyone?
[16:50:37] <innociv> Say I have var int = 2;  How do I do an each 2 twice?  Should I just use for?
[16:51:06] <eddiemonge> innociv: what?
[16:51:21] <innociv> I want to do a loop..
[16:51:28] <innociv> do something twice.
[16:52:10] <eddiemonge> ok so why cant you do a for loop?
[16:53:38] <innociv> Yeah I just though there was an $.each way thati  should do it.
[16:53:40] <innociv> I don't know why
[16:53:45] <innociv> Got it though
[16:54:04] <eddiemonge> stop trying to use jquery for everything. sometimes, pure javascript is far, far better
[16:57:01] <Hilikus> $("div", response) works fine for divs but if i do $("body", response) it returns empty
[16:57:07] <Hilikus> any idea why?
[16:57:30] <Hilikus> there is a body in the html string
[16:58:28] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: what is response? and why do you have a <body> tag in it?
[16:59:07] <Hilikus> the response is an html file
[16:59:11] <Hilikus> valid html
[16:59:31] <Hilikus> so i have a string of all the html code and i'm trying to extract the <body>
[17:00:35] <Hilikus> i'm requesting the html file through ajax
[17:00:36] <eddiemonge> where are you getting it from? what are you trying to do with it?
[17:01:16] <Hilikus> eddiemonge: locally
[17:02:55] <ngharo> wrap the response data in a jquery object: $(responseData).find('body').html()
[17:03:14] <Hilikus> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.ca/2065099
[17:04:06] <Hilikus> ngharo: i tried that but it returns nothing
[17:04:24] <Hilikus> it works if instead of body i extract div
[17:04:42] <Hilikus> but not with body, and the string DOES have a body
[17:05:29] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: whats being returned exactly?
[17:06:33] <Hilikus> returned where? in ajax?
[17:07:27] <Hilikus> http://pastebin.ca/20651
[17:07:39] <Hilikus> that one has the content of htmlDoc with it
[17:08:18] <Hilikus> so, in that case i want to extract "aaa"
[17:08:23] <Hilikus> but it doesnt do it
[17:11:52] <eddiemonge> nothing there
[17:12:49] <Hilikus> sorry eddiemonge http://pastebin.ca/2065103
[17:13:53] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: do you have a live link?
[17:13:55] <Hilikus> nevermind the missing closing ) . i just missed it in the pase
[17:14:03] <Hilikus> what's a live link?
[17:15:45] <Hilikus> i don't understand
[17:15:58] <Hilikus> other selectors work. its something about body
[17:20:03] <eddiemonge> live link = link to your live code
[17:22:47] <innociv> Dead Link = Zelda will never be rescued.
[17:23:29] <Hilikus> eddiemonge: no, its all local
[17:24:22] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: if you inspect the returned data, what does it look like?
[17:24:39] <Hilikus> its the whole html file
[17:24:54] <Hilikus> what i pasted is the content, from the debugger
[17:26:10] <eddiemonge> if you do var data = $(htmlDoc), bod = data.find('body'); console.log(bod.length); what does it give you?
[17:26:35] <snover> please refrain from passing an entire html document using $.ajax
[17:27:11] <Hilikus> snover: why?
[17:27:22] <eddiemonge> tell that to load()
[17:27:50] <Hilikus> but i don't want to load all the page, i want to extract a part of it and plug it into a part of my actual page
[17:28:08] <ajpiano> Hilikus http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784 http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[17:28:15] <ajpiano> that will allow you to do what you are trying to do
[17:30:47] <snover> on the other hand, you could also not waste bandwidth passing useless data that just gets discarded and make everyone happy
[17:30:57] <snover> whatever works for you
[17:33:23] <Hilikus> snover: the thing is the page i'm requesting needs to be a standalone page too
[17:33:42] <Hilikus> but in my case, i need to extract its body and plug it into my document
[17:33:45] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: you could serve two different pages from your backend depending on the request
[17:34:19] <Hilikus> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[17:34:58] <eddiemonge> if your request is for say page?ajax=true you could server just everything in the body section
[17:36:06] <Hilikus> preprocessing it with php??
[17:36:13] <blindMoe> anyone know how to trigger hover events on an iPhone / iPad ?
[17:36:19] <blindMoe> I have seen it done but cannot duplicate it
[17:36:46] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: sometimes a tap will do it
[17:36:51] <eddiemonge> Hilikus: sort of yeah
[17:37:01] <blindMoe> that is what I thought but I cannot get it to work .. kind of a pain
[17:37:22] <Hilikus> eddiemonge: i see
[17:37:26] <Hilikus> maybe i'll do that
[17:37:27] <Hilikus> thanls
[17:38:13] <amid_hasan> blindMoe: you can't trigger hover
[17:38:35] <amid_hasan> blindeMoe: try onTouch event
[17:38:45] <ch3mical> Someone suggest a good "activity indicator" for me?
[17:38:53] <blindMoe> wanted to do it via css but I guess I will have to go about it the JS way
[17:40:17] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: (insert dumb joke involving eyes and seeing here because im too lazy to come up with one at the moment)  what kind of activity?
[17:40:56] <ch3mical> I just want to overlay a spinny doodad while I'm AJAXing
[17:41:09] <ch3mical> Then hide it when the AJAX success fires
[17:41:45] <ch3mical> Rather than create my own I figure there must be dozens out there already
[17:42:15] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: implement it yourself, its easy. ajaxstart: img.show; ajaxcomplete: img.hide
[17:42:22] <psilo2> ch3mical: http://www.ajaxload.info/
[17:45:15] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: that's what I was saying
[17:45:20] <ch3mical> psilo2: thanks
[17:46:00] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxstart/ http://api.jquery.com/ajaxcomplete/
[17:46:01] <njbair> I'm using .tabs() to load some pages as tabs, but is there a way to bind a callback function to the ajax that loads the tab content?
[17:46:11] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: I know, thanks :)
[17:46:29] <vindice> I'm so stuck on an issue. In IE7 setting opacity on some elements makes their absolutely positioned children instantly disappear and not return.
[17:46:50] <njbair> nevermind found it
[17:46:57] <vindice> I've seen advice to set zoom:1 on all elements, but it makes no difference
[17:47:36] <ch3mical> njbair: $('#tabs').tabs({ load: function() { ... } });
[17:48:05] <eddiemonge> vindice: i think you want #css
[17:49:09] <vindice> eddiemonge: thanks. It's cross-over really. Jquery supposedly provides a cross-browser means of setting opacity with $('#elm').css("opacity")
[17:49:17] <vindice> for the most part it's great
[17:49:25] <eddiemonge> vindice: yeah but thats still a css issue
[17:50:04] <vindice> eddiemonge: pointless discussion this really, but it's also a jquery bug with which jquery users may be familiar
[17:50:48] <eddiemonge> how is it a jquery bug when the issue is that setting the opacity on an element hides the absolutely positioned children of that element in ie7?
[17:52:28] <vindice> eddiemonge: in which case how is it a css issue when it works in every other browser
[17:52:46] <vindice> eddiemonge: jquery sets alpha not opacity in internet explorer browsers
[17:52:53] <vindice> should probably say and rather than not
[17:53:18] <vindice> the idea is that jquery gives a cross-browser solution, effectively making internet explorer standards-compliant
[17:53:26] <vindice> in this 1 instance it fails
[17:54:51] <eddiemonge> http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/2006/08/16/css-opacity-in-internet-explorer-ie/
[17:55:44] <vindice> eddiemonge: thanks. That's what I've been doing, ensuiring that the elements have layout with zoom:1
[17:56:03] <vindice> I hadn't seen that javascript hasLayout property though, thanks for that
[18:03:11] <ch3mical> vindice: if you're so certain it's a bug, fix it and win prizes ... who has that URL?
[18:03:19] <ch3mical> ;p
[18:03:25] <eddiemonge> thats for jquery UI
[18:03:31] <ch3mical> Oh, darn
[18:03:37] <ch3mical> I thought it was for all jQuery
[18:07:53] <ch3mical> So ajaxstart only works if there are no active ajax requests... which isn't going to work for me
[18:08:50] <ch3mical> Since I already have other AJAX running at the time I initiate this request
[18:09:40] <eddiemonge> why?
[18:10:44] <ch3mical> Effing connection dropped
[18:11:15] <ch3mical> Anyone know of a way to show a spinner when AJAX starts, even when other AJAX requests are running?
[18:12:16] <ch3mical> Hmmm maybe ajaxSend
[18:12:58] <tomasm-> hey whats it mean when an event has a dot in it, like 'click.editable'? is that a special kind of event that matches both click AND click.editable triggers?
[18:22:40] <routh>  Anyone have any advice on where to look for a jQuery plugin for cascading selects that works well with select boxes that are dynamically generated with PHP? I've found a lot of them that work on JSOP data, but that won't work. My code must degrade properly,
[18:31:38] <Whirl3d> anybody know if there's a way to test for a change in class assignment on an element?
[18:36:49] <coldhead> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/XVQ48/ something like that?
[18:38:32] <vindice> eddiemonge: Thanks for your help earlier. Managed to fix the issue. An ancestor div had position:absolute, but did not have width or height set. I gave it explicit width and height and it solved the issue
[18:39:01] <vindice> the ancestor div already had layout
[18:39:15] <vindice> maybe something to do with overflow:hidden being set by jquery during animations
[18:43:37] <dyakovlev> hello! I'm messing around with repeated jquery animations, and noticed that they get queued up if I go to a different tab. Is there any way to prevent this? setting queue:false in animation attrs didn't really help anything...
[18:44:54] <ColKurtz> dyakovlev, http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[18:45:09] <ColKurtz> also, http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[18:46:07] <dyakovlev> hmm, that's helpful sort of, thanks
[18:48:01] <ch3mical> Later guys
[18:49:06] <dyakovlev> ColKurtz: if the animations are important in the displayin-stateful-data-from-the-server sense, clearing the queue is unfortunately not helpful... any way to keep it running? I'm guessing this is a browser implementation detail, though
[18:49:35] <ColKurtz> ummmmmmmmm
[18:49:55] <ColKurtz> like.. pause the queue instead?
[18:50:39] <dyakovlev> change every animation time in the queue to 0
[18:51:00] <dyakovlev> I think I may have messed up the queue:false-ing, one sec
[18:51:34] <dyakovlev> yes, nevermind. pebkac, queue: false fixes everything :)
[18:52:35] <ColKurtz> glad it worked out
[18:52:40] <ColKurtz> because i was about to say i'm too nub for this
[18:52:40] <ColKurtz> lol
[18:54:07] <dyakovlev> hah
[18:54:32] <dyakovlev> this uncovered a different problem, though: a bunch of animation events with a duration of 0 don't clean up after themselves
[18:54:53] <dyakovlev> i'm seeing leftover overflow-x: hidden and overflow-y: hidden on elements
[19:25:55] <Galaxor> $('div.blah').css('background-image', 'whatever.gif'); does not set the background-image.  If the next call is $('div.blah').css('background-image'), the result is undefined.  What did I do wrong?
[19:28:02] <dxgriffiths> Galaxor: It's likely you need to use url(whatever.gif)
[19:28:32] <Galaxor> dxgriffiths: that's true too.  It turns out that my problem was basically a typo in blah.  balh.
[19:38:50] <dxgriffiths> Galaxor: cool.
[19:39:05] <abjorn> where may wigglaz at
[19:39:07] * abjorn wiggles
[19:43:58] <friskd> Hey all, i wrote this tooltip plugin.  http://pastie.org/1929792
[19:44:22] <friskd> it works just fine when i initialize it like : $(self.element).find('.report').zjTooltip({tooltip:{templateID:UUID+'_ReportItemTmpl', position:'top middle'}});
[19:44:54] <friskd> simplified: $('div')..zjTooltip({tooltip:{position:'top middle'}});
[19:45:17] <friskd> i want to actually have access to the tooltip object it self
[19:45:31] <friskd> so i want to do var x = $('div').zjTooltip({tooltip:{position:'top middle'}});
[19:45:40] <friskd> but, x is actually the div
[19:45:57] <friskd> not the tooltip object.  How do i declare a variable that actually holds the plugin...
[19:46:07] <friskd> *tooltip... not the div element...
[19:48:35] <dxgriffiths> friskd: looking.
[19:48:47] <friskd> dxgriffiths: ?
[19:49:01] <dxgriffiths> I'm looking at the code... brb
[19:49:09] <friskd> o. ok. cool.
[19:49:17] <Whirl3d> I have a div that I simply need to animate off the page to the left, change its contents then return to the right...It's giving me hassles, so I thought I would see if anyone has any suggestions
[19:51:30] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: what's the problem so far?
[19:52:45] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/contact/test-1.html (It's rough and it'll take forever to load over a slow connection, but bare with me)
[19:53:57] <dxgriffiths> friskd: Seems weird that zjTooltip would return a reference to the original div.
[19:54:51] <dxgriffiths> friskd: I'd say line 262 is the problem.
[19:54:56] <friskd> dxgriffiths:  well, i think that is the nature of a jquery plugin, and chaining... the item returned is the element that is selected in the $('.selectedClass')
[19:55:07] <elb0w_> Anyone know any simple plugins that can take text and generate html formating around it? I want to have a user type into a textarea and when I post it get html formating, IE: They get a <br /> if they hit enter
[19:56:41] <dxgriffiths> friskd: if you returned the result of the new call instead of the each() call, you'd get the result you want but it'd break chaining. Maybe add a get method of some kind?
[19:57:03] <friskd> interesting...
[19:57:06] <friskd> let me think about that.
[19:57:14] <dxgriffiths> zjTooltip(options).get()
[19:57:30] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: looking.
[19:59:40] <Whirl3d> basically, my FG element slides off the page nicely, then fails to animate back. It just appears back
[19:59:59] <Whirl3d> and the panel (which should animate to the left) just messes up completely...
[20:00:23] <Whirl3d> dxgriffiths, thanks for your help.
[20:00:55] <friskd> dxgriffiths:  .get though... would that be executing the getFunction in the tooltip
[20:02:13] <friskd> i tried it... didn't seem to do anything...
[20:03:52] <dxgriffiths> friskd: Yeah sorry I meant you'd have to add something of your own. Not get exactly, since that's taken already.
[20:06:23] <dxgriffiths> friskd: Unless you break the standard chaining behavior, and have your plugin return the tooltip div directly.
[20:07:25] <friskd> right. The issue being that i am using things in more of object oriented way... So i need access to the object...
[20:07:34] <friskd> So probably makes sense to do it that way...
[20:08:05] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: still looking.
[20:10:09] <Whirl3d> I'm sure it's a css thing. I hate CSS
[20:10:32] <friskd> My problem i guess is that the plugin it selfs creates the tooltip and it creates a unique id for it. So i don't have a way to uniquely identify the tooltip after it has been created, because it happens in the tooltip....
[20:10:52] <Whirl3d> dxgriffiths, don't spend a lot of time on it. I'll redo the css and figure it out. Thanks for looking though. If you see anything obvious, let me know
[20:11:24] <e-lena> greetings everyone
[20:11:29] <Anitox> woo!
[20:13:19] <e-lena> I happened to test my website using a freeware IEtester software, and the first thing coming up when I open the site is a script error
[20:13:36] <Anitox> IE likes to do that
[20:14:37] <e-lena> is there a way to get rid of it? I wasn't getting any errors in IE9
[20:14:59] <e-lena> IE8,7,6 are the ones causing trouble
[20:15:08] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: watching the style change in web inspector, you can see that right: goes down to -300 as expected but then it just jumps from 0 to -1 and back.
[20:15:48] <aaronfay> I'm using jquery tmpl (via knockout.js), how can I access an item in my template from a plain array (meanin not an array of objects)?
[20:16:40] <dxgriffiths> friskd: Could you set a data: tooltipElement property on the parent element at creation time?
[20:17:32] <friskd> dxgriffiths:  i suppose i could. Not sure that feels very "clean" though... good idea.. let me think about that.
[20:17:58] <dxgriffiths> friskd: np.
[20:22:49] <friskd> dxgriffiths:  that worked nicely actually... I just attached it to the element that i was hovering...
[20:22:55] <friskd> *that i had a reference to.
[20:23:01] <friskd> and your right it does make sense.
[20:23:03] <friskd> tnx!
[20:23:17] <Whirl3d> aha. Maybe when I make the current FG element invisible, it places the css at right:0 since it's relatively positioned....
[20:25:32] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: Yeah that's what I was just thinking. Try commenting out the hide/show and see what happens?
[20:25:36] <dxgriffiths> friskd: Awesome!
[20:48:19] <elb0w_> Anyone use TinyMCE?
[20:52:36] <elb0w_> Cant get this stupid td to change
[20:58:23] <no5thdimension> how would i execute a function when a particular option is selected
[20:58:47] <mattalexx> option?
[20:58:52] <no5thdimension> <option>
[21:00:02] <Zerxer> $("select").change(function(){ //check what this.value is, or check whatever you want on $(this).find('option:selected'); })
[21:00:57] <no5thdimension> ill try that out, cheers
[21:08:25] <paperboy> Hi.  IE shows me Object doesnt support this property of method on this line  var $checkbox = $("#chk_safe");  Any ideas why that is?
[21:13:28] <coldhead> regrets
[21:13:49] <coldhead> paperboy: there is no use of a property or method on that line
[21:13:56] <coldhead> IE must be mistaken
[21:14:38] <Zerxer> IE is probably pointing you at the wrong line
[21:14:49] <Zerxer> I hate IE's JS errors
[21:15:17] <abjorn> loooll
[21:15:21] <coldhead> they are very cryptic
[21:15:30] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[21:15:40] <abjorn> or C++ runtime errors
[21:16:58] <coldhead> it's the same thing
[21:17:05] <abjorn> lol
[21:17:28] <abjorn> nothing like "lol theres an error at 0xsomehexnumber address"
[21:18:09] <coldhead> I thank you for your great effort to our unfinished transfer of fund into your account due to one reason or the other best known to you.
[21:18:32] <abjorn> what.
[21:19:05] <coldhead> #spam
[21:36:29] <Whirl3d> When loading a page, can I use the onLoad event to set my "body" to opacity:0 so that I can preload my elements before showing them? Right now, using "ready", I get a flash of the page elements before i can hide them...is there a preferred way to handle this?
[21:37:32] <amid_hasan> hi
[21:38:02] <Whirl3d> Hi amid_hasan
[21:38:04] <amid_hasan> anyon in here an expert in ui skinning with jquery?
[21:38:11] <amid_hasan> Whirl3d :)
[21:38:44] <Whirl3d> <--definitely not an expert on ui skinning...sorry
[21:44:09] <Whirl3d> This channel has been so weird today. Usually people are chatty non-stop...Today, it's like a ghost town... 8('
[21:44:18] <amid_hasan> Whirl3d, have any tips on incorporating html5 sound w/ jquery?
[21:44:31] <amid_hasan> Weird. I though jquery was popular
[21:44:35] <amid_hasan> *thought
[21:44:47] <Whirl3d> It is. And usually this channel is really really busy
[21:45:28] <Whirl3d> amid_hasan, I haven't worked with sound yet. Still trying to wrap my head around video.
[21:46:02] <amid_hasan> Darn.
[21:47:05] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: the most effective way would be to actually style the body element.
[21:47:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's the best way to seelct all elements except the first of the siblings
[21:47:53] <ProLoser|Mobile> :not(:first)?
[21:48:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> :gt(1)?
[21:48:26] <amid_hasan> $(*.nth(!))
[21:48:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> huh?
[21:49:03] <Whirl3d> dxgriffiths, that's what I am doing.
[21:49:14] <tomasm-> how do i indicate an element that does NOT have a certain child/grandchild/etc?
[21:49:22] <tomasm-> as a css-like selector
[21:49:25] <dxgriffiths> Right, but if you're getting a flash then you need to do it earlier.
[21:50:10] <Whirl3d> dxgriffiths, so I should make body invisible in css and then manually make it visible once loaded...
[21:50:26] <Hierofant> Hi.  Anyone have a handy guide to 3D in HTML?  I realize Flash is currently the only cross-browser way to do it, but wanted to investigate how latest trends were working
[21:50:43] <dxgriffiths> Whirl3d: Yeah I'd say so. And in the page itself, not using an externally loaded file.
[21:51:03] <Whirl3d> dxgriffiths, i'll try it out. Thanks.
[21:51:14] <futini> hi to all
[21:51:28] <Whirl3d> Hierofant, I do a lot of work with 3D photography, but nothing on the web/html sorry.
[21:51:38] <Whirl3d> futini, hi
[21:53:04] <Whirl3d> tomasm, have you tried, $(selector).not($(selector).find(skippedselector))
[21:56:55] <tomasm-> Whirl3d, i actually am trying this: j("#parent").hover(function() { if(!j(this).find('.child')) { good stuff;...
[22:00:57] <tomasm-> rather, if(j(this).find('.child').size() == 0) { # its not there
[22:05:32] <Whirl3d> tomasm, I'll probably catch hell for admitting this, but I use a simple function call "exists" and it works great for me. All "exists" does is return this value $(selector) && $(selector).length++$(selector).jquery
[22:07:12] <futini> hi
[22:07:14] <Whirl3d> tomasm, so I'd use: if (!exists($(this).find('.child'))) {works great
[22:07:31] <futini> somebody helpme whit this please http://jsfiddle.net/LS7rf/
[22:07:54] <futini> i cant get text of textarea
[22:08:37] <JethroLarson> Whirl3d: rather than if ($(this).find('.child').length){ ?
[22:10:15] <Cork> futini: the submit button isn't inside the textarea so $(this).closest won't work
[22:10:40] <Whirl3d> JethroLarson, yeah. I was told that just checking length like that would sometimes return true because the jquery object is returned. I find it semantically easier to read as well when debugging
[22:10:59] <Cork> futini: futher more you need to stop the submit to get this to work
[22:11:11] <Cork> futini: http://jsfiddle.net/LS7rf/2/
[22:13:27] <JethroLarson> Should probably bind to the submit event instead of the click.
[22:13:27] <JethroLarson> http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/LS7rf/4/
[22:16:19] <JethroLarson> length never returns true, it's an integer
[22:16:37] <JethroLarson> @Whirl3d
[22:18:25] <JethroLarson> though any number that's not 0, Infinity, or NaN evaluates to true
[22:18:57] <Whirl3d> JethroLarson, I agree. I'm not telling you that I am right, I'm just telling you what I was told in this here channel. I used to check to see if a jquery object existed by checking for length and had some problems. I changed it (on someone's suggestion) and it solved them. Wish I could tell you more
[22:20:51] <JethroLarson> I wish you could to because I don't think I've seen .length fail in the 4 years I've been using jQuery
[22:21:02] <Whirl3d> JethroLarson, I think it must've been because I was using the argument of a function call to test and things like strings and arrays have a length property
[22:22:02] <JethroLarson> well yeah if you did $(this).val().length that wouldn't be testing the right thing
[22:22:44] <Whirl3d> or if you did function (arg) { if (arg.length) {       would mess up as well.
[22:23:39] <Whirl3d> I also read on ajPiano's site that either $.fn.map or $.map returns an array, but not necessarily a jquery object...there's another example of when .length would fail.
[22:24:41] <Whirl3d> But like I said, I am not advocating my way of doing it. It just works for me when .length for some reason on some project didn't.
[22:27:04] <JethroLarson> Kind of fixing the wrong problem, you should know what kind of object you're testing
[22:27:34] <Whirl3d> I like to keep myself guessing
[22:32:06] <futini> How I can get the value of "texarea" corresponding to each input? This is a generated code "php"
[22:32:17] <futini> http://jsfiddle.net/LS7rf/6/
[22:32:40] <futini> the html code es generate by php
[22:33:09] <Cork> futini: you would have to use an each on the selector
[22:33:15] <Cork> ?.val @ futini
[22:33:15] <bot-t> futini, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[22:33:25] <Cork> first element
[22:33:48] <JethroLarson> also, id= is supposed to be unique
[22:33:51] <tmayr> futini: also you have two items with the same id, ID's are unique
[22:33:59] <tmayr> and, input is a self closing tag
[22:34:06] <tmayr> so you do input id="post" type="submit"/
[22:34:08] <Cork> JethroLarson: not supposed, they are enfoced to be
[22:34:12] <futini> but, is a code generate by php
[22:34:19] <Cork> (sorry i missed that part)
[22:34:21] <tmayr> so you do <input id="post" type="submit"/>
[22:34:23] <tmayr> silly key.
[22:34:28] <JethroLarson> CSS still works with duplicated ids
[22:34:31] <Cork> futini: use a class instead
[22:34:36] <tmayr> JethroLarson: jquery wont
[22:34:42] <Cork> JethroLarson: ya, but getElementById doesn't
[22:34:50] <JethroLarson> True
[22:35:06] <JethroLarson> what about querySelectorAll?
[22:35:35] <Cork> i don't think it accepts more then one id, but not sure
[22:35:40] <Cork> and anyway its invalid html
[22:35:55] <Cork> just replace the id attribute with a class, and it should work just fine
[22:36:33] <futini> :/
[22:36:39] <futini> its more complicated
[22:36:48] <Cork> no its not
[22:37:04] <JethroLarson> Just tested it. qsa supports multiple elements with the same id, at least in chrome
[22:37:16] <futini> i replace the id atribute whit a class, but how selected the textarea
[22:37:16] <JethroLarson> http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/wGDD8/
[22:38:03] <tmayr> html like that makes me the creeps :p
[22:38:34] <Cork> futini: just do $('.<class name>')
[22:39:22] <JethroLarson> <STRONG><font size=1><strong>Creepy</font></Strong></stronG>
[22:39:30] <tmayr> oh my...
[22:39:31] <tmayr> haha
[22:39:44] <Cork> JethroLarson: don't forget <CENTER> ;)
[22:39:54] <tmayr> and wrap it inside a table, for good measure
[22:40:07] <JethroLarson> and use divs to separate rows
[22:40:13] <Cork> OH and don't forget <blink> XD
[22:40:25] <tmayr> oh man blink
[22:40:25] <tmayr> haha
[22:40:45] <JethroLarson> marque
[22:41:22] <JethroLarson> <blink> it's like old school css3 animations
[22:41:34] <Cork> yup
[22:41:45] <JethroLarson> MM_preload
[22:42:11] <JethroLarson> spacer.gif
[22:42:11] <JethroLarson> good times
[22:42:36] <tmayr> i didnt know html back then, haha
[22:43:37] <JethroLarson> :) create an rich html email, it's still like that
[22:44:06] <tmayr> yeah ive heard, i MIGHT have to do that soon :/
[22:44:39] <Cork> ya, stupid outlook
[22:45:02] <Cork> i did an newsletter generator just when 2007 came
[22:45:05] <Cork> it soucked hard!
[22:45:08] <tmayr> if it comes down to that, i might have to play the "oh sorry, thats not listed in the requierements docs you sent"
[22:45:27] <JethroLarson> 2007 was such a step backward
[22:45:33] <Cork> ya
[22:45:47] <futini> http://jsfiddle.net/LS7rf/10/ how fixed this, i cant get variable
[22:45:49] <Cork> word as an html renderer is a gigantic step backwards
[22:46:00] <JethroLarson> Yup
[22:46:09] <Cork> wellcome to the year 1995
[22:46:26] <Cork> heres the new shiny thing: TABLES!
[22:46:28] <Cork> -_-'
[22:47:30] <Whirl3d> My first computer class involved punching about 1800 cards and assembling them in order to do a simple math excercise. Took about a week and god forbid you drop your cards...start all over
[22:50:08] <tmayr> god i keep pressing cmd+s on jsfiddle ._.
[22:50:24] <JethroLarson> futini http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/LS7rf/11/
[22:50:27] <Cork> heh, i do the same on web editors XD
[22:50:38] <JethroLarson> They should map it to update
[22:50:49] <JethroLarson> or run?
[22:50:50] <Cork> but its ctrl here though
[22:51:15] <Cork> should be update
[22:51:30] <Cork> run doesn't really save
[22:51:39] <Cork> so it would be strange to bind it to that
[22:52:06] <tmayr> it should be whatever doesnt pop a save dialog
[22:52:08] <tmayr> haha
[22:52:51] <futini> this : http://jsfiddle.net/LS7rf/15/
[22:53:01] <futini> i can get the textarea but not the second
[22:53:14] <tmayr> futini: JethroLarson already linked you to the solution
[22:53:15] <tmayr> scroll up
[22:54:25] <futini> aaaaaaaa
[22:54:26] <futini> thanks

[22:59:20] <dr0id> everyone is down
[22:59:21] <edude03> Oh hey dr0id :P
[22:59:27] <dr0id> hey hey
[22:59:31] <edude03> I'm just learning jq
[22:59:33] <tmayr> hihi
[22:59:44] <edude03> and I want to write a selector to iterate through a table
[22:59:51] <dr0id> then write it
[22:59:58] <dr0id> who are you waiting for ?
[23:00:17] <edude03> basically I need to select tr then get the text of their children
[23:00:23] <edude03> But I don't know how to do it yet :P
[23:00:40] <dr0id> $('table tr td').text(); ?
[23:00:42] <tmayr> you should give it a go
[23:00:47] <tmayr> :D
[23:00:47] <dr0id> there's a each function
[23:00:49] <dr0id> but just do it
[23:00:52] <dr0id> please, just do it
[23:00:56] <dr0id> don't wait for us
[23:03:21] <edude03> Not really waiting for you guys
[23:03:28] <edude03> Just trying to figure out how selectors work
[23:03:55] <tmayr> a hint, you will need to read on each and children
[23:08:45] <edude03> Thanks guys
[23:08:58] <edude03> I think I'm going to have to tackle this when I'm awake :P
