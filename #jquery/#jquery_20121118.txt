[00:32:33] <bradbrad> Hi Guys... I have a image slider and all im trying to do is add a div called bx-cover at the end (so that I can use it to create a mask for the slider), but just cant get it right! Please help http://pastebin.com/24j9fcAD
[00:33:50] <bradbrad> #css
[00:35:36] <bradbrad> anyone? please
[00:59:57] <cisforcojo> i've got a table with the first row being the day of the week (mon - fri) with a colspace of 2 and the next being "AM" or "PM". how would i search for a cell of "Wed AM" for example?
[01:18:14] <mbn_18> Hi, I wish to show floating content every time I use hover() or hoverIntent(). I should use the jquery UI tooltip, or something else?
[01:24:03] <emx> which event is triggered when the mouse wheel is scrolled down?
[01:43:02] <cheshair> Hi! Suppose I have this html snippet http://dpaste.com/832810/ How can I select that particular input button?
[02:07:16] <Zerpex> Hi, I have a small piece of code that calculates width and height every resize done by the browser - but from a performance perspective, this is really heavy - and I want to only calculate it every 100ms - how is this possible? I know I can use the setTimeout function, but where I should put it, I don't know :(
[02:08:02] <cisforcojo> cheshair: is it the only <input>? $('input') should work
[02:08:08] <cisforcojo> otherwise give it an id?
[02:09:15] <cheshair> cisforcojo: hey thanks for your hint! I managed to solve with this: http://dpaste.com/832816/
[02:09:53] <cisforcojo> nice :)
[02:10:27] <entrada> Zerpex: jquery.debounce
[02:10:43] <entrada> ?g jquery.debounce Zerpex
[02:10:44] <b-ot> entrada, sorry, no results for ‚Äüjquery.debounce Zerpex‚Äù.
[02:12:35] <Zerpex> entrada: no results for me :D
[02:12:46] <entrada> lol yeah forgot the syntax Zerpex
[02:20:29] <Zerpex> entrada: so http://pastebin.com/5ysit0Hy should work? :S
[02:22:21] <entrada> Zerpex: no, like this: http://pastebin.com/cYF73tkz
[02:22:58] <Heather_> whats the best way to check what's inside a json object?
[02:23:08] <Heather_> alert just says object Object
[02:23:12] <Zerpex> ahh nice awesome! Thanks entrada !
[02:23:17] <entrada> Zerpex: :)
[02:33:19] <Zerpex> but still a lot to include a library for delaying a function being fired :D
[02:36:51] <entrada> Zerpex: well, its pretty small
[02:36:57] <entrada> 2 kb i think
[02:37:50] <Zerpex> 0.7kb minified - but yeah, seems pretty useful tho! should be faster to download 0.7kb, than recalculate stuff that often
[02:38:14] <entrada> yep

[03:02:43] <entrada> what is "country" in your code?
[03:02:55] <entrada> you're passing it as a param to the $.post

[03:03:08] <entrada> fix it and your code works
[03:03:32] <jessica> entrada i did not get you
[03:03:46] <entrada> jessica:  see the $.post line
[03:03:58] <entrada> jessica: there's a variable used called country. it doesnt exist
[03:04:11] <jessica> Country:<input type="text" name='country' id='country'>
[03:04:17] <jessica> its calling this
[03:04:23] <jessica> see the html code
[03:04:33] <jessica> http://jsfiddle.net/uLaTU/1/
[03:05:02] <entrada> that's not how you get a dom element's value using jquery
[03:05:06] <entrada> you're using it like a variable
[03:05:09] <entrada> it doesnt work
[03:05:36] <jessica> i am just trying to copy from the video, its said like that
[03:05:39] <entrada> add a line country = $('#country').value()
[03:05:51] <entrada> sorry country = $('#country').val()
[03:05:54] <entrada> well, its wrong
[03:06:00] <entrada> or you missed a line

[03:11:11] <entrada> yeah it works
[03:11:20] <jessica> it has to be name : country and not name: name
[03:11:36] <jessica> but i am not getting the value from the php
[03:12:06] <entrada> well, that's what your variable is called. its called 'name' and not 'country'
[03:12:07] <jessica> $('div#name-data').text(data);    // this should say 'hello'
[03:13:18] <jessica> kk that will be used to send to php but right now we are talking about receiving from php
[03:14:03] <jessica> u got me ?? i need $('div#name-data').text(data);    // this should say 'hello'
[03:15:10] <jessica> when you click on show, i should see 'hello' on the html page

[04:29:28] <mowol> Any ideas on how i can show the user that a product is added to their cart? I cant figure out how because the product is added through a form (page change)
[05:54:47] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/uhqQw/1/ - I'm using jQuery Cycle to rotate some grey boxes, but unfortunately this plugin sets some CSS making the grey boxes no longer adjust dynamically to the blue sidebar - is there a way to fix this?
[05:55:11] <snowfox_ben> I was attempting to add 75.00 and 10, and it the result was 1075.00 - do I need to force my variables to an int or something?
[05:56:26] <snowfox_ben> parseInt‚Ä¶.got it :)
[06:00:06] <tomtwo> i've one question regarding the query tmpl engine. it works fine, but when i render the template jquery ignore the data-role attribut and dont render the dom like the definition in the template? is there a function which i can call to "rerender" the content?
[06:02:48] <Misiur> snowfox_ben: don't forget about the second argument (compare parseInt("08") and parseInt("08", 10))
[06:05:38] <snowfox_ben> Yup
[06:05:41] <snowfox_ben> Thanks :)
[06:05:53] <snowfox_ben> Dealing with some noob decimal issues, but I think I got it figured out
[06:07:23] <tomtwo> my jquery tmpl template, include some jquery mobile markup, but when i call the tmpl() function and assign the data for the template, jquery don't render the jquery mobile markup, like it will when i define the markup directly
[06:08:17] <tomtwo> i'm new to jquery, but for me it looks like that i've to call the jquery parser again to look for some special markup definitions like data-role etc after rendering the template
[06:09:11] <entrada> tomtwo: jquery tmpl is discontinued. try mustache or underscore template
[06:10:40] <tomtwo> entrada: ah ok, what can you recommend? is there any standard template engine?
[06:10:55] <entrada> i just mentioned two tomtwo
[06:11:48] <tomtwo> entrada: ok, i'll have a look. the problem i mentioned is it related to the "deprecated" tmpl engine?
[06:12:20] <entrada> tomtwo: maybe. dunno if it has any bugs
[06:13:06] <Misiur> If it was discontinued before 1.8 then you might have some problems using jq 1.8
[06:15:30] <entrada> Misiur: don't think so. must be an issue in the tmpl library
[06:21:15] <agu10^_> how does twitter manage to load /i/something INSTANTLY in the URL, and THEN load the actual page using ajax? How do they change the URL without having to reload the website?
[06:21:52] <danfromuk> Hi, has anyone used CookieGuard jquery plugin?
[06:22:44] <Misiur> agu10^_: HTML5 State API
[06:24:08] <agu10^_> Misiur, state?
[06:24:42] <Misiur> History/state. You have answer on ##javascript
[06:38:10] <tomtwo> entrada: thanks for the tipp, i had the same problem with the other template engine, but after triggering the "create" event again, jquery will parse the markup again
[06:38:23] <entrada> cool, good stuff!
[06:41:15] <arcanis> if I want to show/hide something according to a flag, is the simpler way to do it `$el[flag ? 'show' : 'hide']()` ?
[06:41:26] <arcanis> *simplest
[06:41:48] <entrada> just run toggle()
[06:41:54] <entrada> $el.toggle()
[06:42:00] <arcanis> it doesn't do the same thing
[06:42:19] <entrada> $el.toggle(flag)
[06:42:22] <entrada> that works
[06:42:25] <entrada> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[06:42:40] <arcanis> oh, right
[06:42:42] <arcanis> thanks
[06:42:45] <entrada> :)
[06:49:44] <cheshair> Hi! I am struggling to have this snippet working: http://dpaste.com/832889/ When user clicks on download button I want to check selected value from a dropdown list. If selected value is "Closed" then I want to pop-up a confirmation box. Of course main download event must be inhibited and only executed if user gives confirm. It seems to me that e.preventDefault position is wrong... but I need some tips
[07:02:36] <Bauer> lol I have a big problem.. I have a form I am trying to validate using jQuery like: $("#FirstNameID").blur(function() { (and same for $("#LastNameID"), and $("#number_Phone")..) - each one has REGEX matches to ensure string entered is allowed, else it will display error message in proper div, and focus input BACK into this field
[07:03:28] <Bauer> Problem is, when the user enters something WRONG on the first field, ALL .blur terms start to trigger and they go into infi loop :D
[07:03:37] <Bauer> each .blur takes focus from the other field LOL
[07:03:48] <Bauer> how to solve this?
[07:04:17] <Bauer> if I focus on the third field, then all 3 start to dance :)
[07:22:47] <dogmatic69> Hi all, I am getting a load of errors when including this script https://raw.github.com/cakephp/debug_kit/master/webroot/js/js_debug_toolbar.js
[07:23:08] <dogmatic69> all of a sudden its like $ does not exist. Anyone know what is going on?
[07:24:46] <dogmatic69> I get a load of errors like 'Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function '
[07:28:27] <e-dard> Is it possible to using some client-side script to monitor a 3rd party web-page for changes to the page (specifically the appearance of a button)
[07:28:43] <e-dard> I would want the script to click the button when it appears on the page
[07:29:24] <dogmatic69> e-dard: you can not do cross domain ajax, unless its been specifically allowed on that other server afaik
[07:29:39] <dogmatic69> or on yours, cant remember which.
[07:30:31] <e-dard> dogmatic69: but if the script is running on my machine/browser how isn't it just the same as me clicking the button?
[07:30:44] <e-dard> sorry if I'm being dense about this :)
[07:30:54] <dogmatic69> e-dard: look up xss
[07:31:57] <dogmatic69> e-dard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[07:32:35] <e-dard> OK, I see
[07:32:53] <e-dard> I thought I could avoid css / sop by running the script on my own browser but I guess not
[07:33:11] <e-dard> (I suppose that's exactly how attackers to the same thing to vicitms..)
[07:33:35] <dogmatic69> ye
[07:33:44] <e-dard> So I suppose one option would be to write a Chrome or Firefox extension?
[07:33:48] <e-dard> Or a grease monkey script?
[07:33:49] <dogmatic69> no
[07:34:13] <dogmatic69> you can use something like php and file_get_contents('http://other-server.com');
[07:34:20] <dogmatic69> and do the ajax to your php script
[07:34:44] <e-dard> but that assumes that the button is a web-form right?
[07:34:54] <dogmatic69> what button?
[07:34:55] <e-dard> Can it handle if the button is JS based?
[07:35:09] <e-dard> ^^ "(specifically the appearance of a button)"
[07:35:34] <e-dard> I want to monitor a web-page where at a certain time a button will appear. I then want the script to click the button
[07:35:48] <e-dard> The button may or may not be a web-form button (not sure yet)
[07:37:40] <e-dard> dogmatic69: does that change anything?
[07:47:48] <_boot> .clearQueue should kill off any waiting .delay right?
[08:07:09] <harle_> hello

[09:32:40] <veQue> i have A B C... C=A+B,  B=C-A,  A=C-B
[09:33:25] <veQue> i want the last two fields i touch be based on the numbers i enter
[09:33:42] <veQue> and i want the remaining field to calculate
[09:33:52] <veQue> any one know how to do this?
[09:35:37] <otherj> probably one of 5 million tutorials on the web
[09:36:35] <veQue> well thanks

[09:39:11] <tomtwo> what is the most famous template engine for jquery? I need conditions....
[09:40:56] <otherj> most famous? just google it man
[09:41:00] <otherj> famous has nothing to do with it
[09:41:10] <otherj> doesn't tmpl do conditions?
[09:44:59] <tomtwo> otherj: but tmpl is deprecated.. is a good idea to use this template engine?

[11:01:07] <finspin> hi guys, im getting quite confused how to apply a method on multiple selectors (selectors contain set of elements). I'm trying to do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/YHah4/3/ but it doesn't work as expected. The method is always applied only to the second set of links. Where am I going wrong?
[11:03:24] <shoky> finspin: $('a.one, a.two')
[11:03:35] <shoky> and no need for the .each
[11:03:48] <shoky> and if you want the fiddle to work, choose jquery on the left
[11:05:27] <finspin> shoky: ah, thanks a lot!
[11:07:47] <finspin> shoky: btw, how can i see the source code of my sample  in jsfiddle after i press the button?
[11:08:16] <finspin> press the button in my sample i mean (in the result window)
[11:09:32] <finspin> forget my last question. just realised that it's applied right in the result window.

[11:40:49] <hugo_moss> and the carousel next button doesnt work
[11:41:34] <hugo_moss> also for some reason the itemLoadcallback is called multiple times
[11:41:37] <hugo_moss> dont know why

[11:41:58] <karolyi> the carousel next works for me

[11:46:00] <recurse>         var id= event.target.id;
[11:46:12] <recurse> seems you're not targeting the appropriate ID's
[11:46:18] <recurse> perhaps you need to add the id names to an array
[11:46:30] <hugo_moss> which browser?
[11:47:04] <recurse> FF
[11:47:12] <recurse> do you have firebug?
[11:47:20] <recurse> run your page through Console
[11:47:34] <recurse> it will help you track down the issues fairly quickly
[11:47:48] <hugo_moss> i dont get that error on chrome
[11:47:53] <hugo_moss> let me try mozilla firebug
[11:48:23] <bradbrad> maybe this will help more... here is the site (still being developed), with the slider beneath. Im trying to create a png overlay and the only way i know how is to have a div at the end. Now I know php (well fairly ok), but not great on jquery. How do I add a div at the end that i can then style with the image to overlay? heres the site http://yourgreenbox.vertexcentral.com/index.php and heres the code  http://pastebin.com/trXYtTXH
[11:49:39] <hugo_moss> holy shit recurse

[11:50:23] <recurse> ask Google
[11:50:32] <recurse> i havent a clue
[11:51:25] <hugo_moss> thanks for that
[11:51:53] <hugo_moss> problem still there tho..hmm
[11:53:05] <hugo_moss> see the problem is im setting the jcarousel items to the left:-9999em, absolute positioning them
[11:53:24] <hugo_moss> and then before fading it in, i hide it and set the position to relative, left inherit
[11:53:47] <hugo_moss> so that jcarousel can read the width and height info right, and load them in
[11:53:47] <recurse> there is something blocking it
[11:53:54] <hugo_moss> yeah
[11:53:57] <recurse> hide it
[11:54:03] <recurse> display:none
[11:54:14] <recurse> or ('#thestinkinID').hide()
[11:54:27] <hugo_moss> i do hide it before setting the position relative
[11:54:29] <hugo_moss> and then fade it in
[11:54:31] <recurse> or ('.thestinkinClass').hide()
[11:54:45] <recurse> you must have faded it to 0 opacity
[11:54:50] <recurse> and never hid it
[11:55:15] <recurse> oh
[11:55:17] <recurse> no
[11:55:27] <recurse> you have your carasoul nav disabled
[11:55:29] <hugo_moss> $('#mycarousel').hide();
[11:55:30] <hugo_moss>                     $('#mycarousel').css({"position":"relative", "left": "inherit"});
[11:55:40] <recurse> disabled="disabled"
[11:55:52] <recurse> <div class="jcarousel-next jcarousel-next-horizontal jcarousel-next-disabled jcarousel-next-disabled-horizontal" style="display: block;" disabled="disabled"></div>
[11:55:56] <hugo_moss> hmm?
[11:55:59] <recurse> thats what renders
[11:56:01] <guy> how do I make jQuery use native browser implementation to animate element position?
[11:56:40] <guy> (meaning CSS transitions, for eg.)
[11:56:55] <recurse> you need html 5 and css3 for anything native
[11:57:08] <guy> ya, so.
[11:57:43] <hugo_moss> yea the horizontal next button is disabled, jcarousel is deciding that, why i dont know
[11:58:05] <recurse> perhaps config option for allowing multiple carousals?
[11:58:08] <hugo_moss> if you look at the items, theyre stacked vertically
[11:58:10] <recurse> Google it
[11:58:21] <recurse> no they're not, not on FF
[11:58:22] <hugo_moss> they have to be on a single row
[11:58:25] <recurse> what browser?
[11:58:30] <hugo_moss> ff
[11:58:55] <hugo_moss> oh sorry
[11:58:56] <hugo_moss> not ff
[11:59:08] <recurse> FireFox
[11:59:14] <recurse> what browser are you using?
[11:59:16] <recurse> Chrome?
[11:59:37] <recurse> oh
[11:59:42] <recurse> some browsers are mor fogiving
[11:59:52] <recurse> that list-style tag should prob be on the UL and not the li
[12:00:27] <recurse> (hence your stacking)
[12:01:40] <recurse> i gatta be honest with you pal. .. the ui effects suck and arent worth the trouble
[12:01:49] <recurse> really they're not
[12:01:58] <recurse> especially not good for SEO as well
[12:02:11] <recurse> and what if i have Javascript disabled?
[12:02:21] <recurse> your entire site navigation breaks?
[12:02:24] <recurse> meh
[12:05:27] <hugo_moss> if theyre smart enough to turn off javascript, theyre smart enough to turn it back on
[12:05:36] <harami> Hello, the thumbnails in the bottom right, if you scroll them with the arrow, you will see it scrolls too fast, how can i slow it down 198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[12:07:39] <recurse> but what of search engines?
[12:09:05] <hugo_moss> ill worry about it later
[12:09:08] <recurse> n/m i assumed they wher js generated, i see theyr in lists
[12:09:15] <hugo_moss> yea
[12:09:19] <hugo_moss> theyre in the uls
[12:09:36] <recurse> any sub catagories dynamically load in links?
[12:09:44] <recurse> no, right? they're just hidden for the time being?
[12:10:05] <hugo_moss> which links?
[12:10:09] <recurse> thats not too bad, but the engines do know if you're hiding content, and prob wont give much value to hidden links
[12:10:17] <recurse> the links in the sub menus
[12:10:22] <recurse> say under Accessories
[12:10:27] <hugo_moss> oh, ive only done for accessories
[12:10:31] <hugo_moss> if you click the others
[12:10:41] <hugo_moss> itll just show the accessories
[12:10:44] <recurse> i didnt notice another request qhen clicking so i assume they live on the page, just hidden until you click
[12:11:19] <hugo_moss> yea i just hide them
[12:11:32] <hugo_moss> i add the menu and save it with jquery live
[12:11:34] <hugo_moss> listen with live
[12:11:38] <recurse> oh
[12:11:41] <recurse> so you are
[12:11:43] <recurse> hmm
[12:11:58] <hugo_moss> and just hide show when you go back and forth
[12:12:09] <recurse> im just concearned you havent given any valuable search engine indexing consideration when building your navigation
[12:12:16] <harami> ?
[12:12:23] <hugo_moss> well this is not a real project
[12:12:33] <hugo_moss> im just trying to learn jquery
[12:12:38] <hugo_moss> this is my first website
[12:12:44] <recurse> ah
[12:12:46] <hugo_moss> i have never done seo
[12:13:07] <hugo_moss> but i remember thinking that it might have been a problem
[12:13:18] <hugo_moss> and got caught up in the effects
[12:14:12] <recurse> yea people dont like fading in webpages and weird UI effects. Rule of thumb- follow what the big boys do. Theyve already done this  bajillion times, have focus groups, A/B split test the shit out of things ...
[12:14:14] <hugo_moss> it seems its getting the count of how many carousel items right, and the url with image width and height information right,
[12:14:46] <hugo_moss> i just dont get why the next button is disabled
[12:14:51] <hugo_moss> ok well i know this much
[12:15:03] <hugo_moss> that the width of the content is incorrect
[12:15:18] <recurse> generally speaking, yes
[12:15:19] <hugo_moss> its too narrow,
[12:15:30] <recurse> it should be atleast 1024 full screen
[12:15:35] <hugo_moss> its incorrectly calculating the width of the content
[12:15:45] <hugo_moss> no i mean the content in the slider
[12:16:08] <recurse> ahh yes that would do it ... prob some logic that disabled Next if nothing to slide too ... calculated by container width
[12:16:27] <hugo_moss> the sliders width is incorrectly calculated, i had this problem before, and got it fixed by doing what im doing now but its not workin
[12:16:39] <hugo_moss> it has to do with hiding it and fading in the contente
[12:16:41] <recurse> set a width on the container of the slider
[12:16:46] <hugo_moss> for some reason the content is not ready
[12:16:52] <hugo_moss> when the jcarousel gets the items
[12:16:58] <hugo_moss> and the items arent loaded right
[12:17:07] <recurse> are you loading on document ready ?
[12:17:18] <hugo_moss> yeah
[12:17:24] <hugo_moss> i call jcarousel in document ready
[12:17:36] <hugo_moss> with the itemloadcallback function set to the callback in another js file
[12:17:51] <recurse>  width: 726px;
[12:17:54] <hugo_moss> the itemloadcallback has a live function in it, that when a brand is clicked it calls that
[12:18:01] <recurse> its too wide
[12:18:10] <recurse> you manually set its width on the div itself
[12:18:29] <hugo_moss> which brand?
[12:18:30] <recurse> id="mycarousel"
[12:18:50] <hugo_moss> did i
[12:18:53] <recurse> set it too 100% but set the parent element's width to your desired width
[12:18:55] <hugo_moss> 1 sec
[12:19:07] <recurse> yea
[12:19:11] <recurse> its wider then the parent
[12:19:19] <recurse> maybe its gatta be
[12:20:05] <recurse> <div class="jcarousel-clip jcarousel-clip-horizontal" style="position: relative;">
[12:20:18] <recurse> .jcarousel-clip-horizontal is the class you want
[12:20:30] <recurse> thats what sets your parent scroll width
[12:20:34] <recurse> which is current 611px
[12:20:39] <recurse> currently*
[12:21:04] <recurse> your child element 	id="mycarousel" has a width of 726px
[12:21:21] <recurse> i suspect one of these if off
[12:21:26] <hugo_moss> why is it set to 611px?
[12:21:38] <recurse> prob the width of the content area inside that box
[12:21:39] <hugo_moss> oh wait i remember
[12:21:52] <hugo_moss> which brand did you click?
[12:21:56] <harami> Hello, the thumbnails in the bottom right, if you scroll them with the arrow, you will see it scrolls too fast, how can i slow it down 198.58.86.52/~rondaf/gallery/under-water/
[12:21:57] <hugo_moss> because i got a width of 226px
[12:22:02] <recurse> Accessories > Durrecell
[12:22:45] <hugo_moss> i got a width of 290 for duracell
[12:22:59] <guy> is there a performance difference between adding a CSS class and setting all the same properties using .css({})?
[12:23:38] <pifantastic> guy: use a CSS class. It
[12:23:44] <pifantastic> 's a better separation
[12:23:50] <pifantastic> and should be faster
[12:24:08] <recurse> guy since you're also now involving js to apply the very CSS you could apply without it yes  ... but the difference is prob negligible
[12:24:36] <recurse> however, there may be instances you need to addClass
[12:25:53] <recurse> $('.yourStinkinClass').addClass("someSillyNewClass");
[12:26:12] <hugo_moss> recurse: its choosing the width as 290, but theres 4, 109px width pictures plus 70px margin for each picture
[12:26:15] <recurse> and then remove it $('.yourStinkinClass').removeClass("someSillyNewClass");
[12:26:41] <hugo_moss> something is blocking it from calculating the right width
[12:26:51] <recurse> hugo, it sounds like a css issue with widths and inheriting and lists, etc
[12:26:55] <recurse> aye
[12:26:57] <hugo_moss> (which is why i set it to absolute, so that the pictures are always shown, just not in view
[12:27:11] <hugo_moss> yeah
[12:27:14] <hugo_moss> i think so
[12:27:15] <recurse> why deviate from working examples you obviously started from ?
[12:28:15] <hugo_moss> i wanted effects
[12:28:22] <hugo_moss> the jcarousel had no effects
[12:28:27] <hugo_moss> it has issues with .hide()
[12:29:12] <hugo_moss> it cant calculate the right width if its hidden, they have a width 0?hmm but thats only if its display: none
[12:30:27] <recurse> i dont know dude ... i do know that you should prob go back to a wworking, vanilla sample, and come back and allow the room to try to help you apply your transitions at the right points
[12:31:01] <hugo_moss> yeah
[12:31:03] <hugo_moss> alright
[12:31:07] <hugo_moss> thanks tho recurse
[12:31:10] <hugo_moss> i appreciate it
[12:31:13] <recurse> becuase from expierence, i can tell you you prob broke some shit along the way
[12:31:18] <recurse> no worries
[12:31:19] <hugo_moss> haha yea
[12:32:32] <recurse> oh
[12:32:34] <recurse> i think i know
[12:32:41] <recurse> you have overflow hidden on your child div
[12:32:56] <recurse> id="mycarousel"
[12:33:07] <recurse> but you already have overflow hidden on its parent
[12:33:13] <recurse> with your j carasol clip class
[12:33:42] <recurse> remove  overflow: hidden; from your id="mycarousel" div
[12:33:49] <recurse> its not needed
[12:34:01] <recurse> and is prob cuasing the content to clip prematurely
[12:34:24] <recurse> however i see you did set a realy large width just now, so perhaps that should compensate
[12:35:18] <hugo_moss> in firebug
[12:35:29] <hugo_moss> the ul mycarousel has overflow hidden
[12:35:42] <hugo_moss> its parent is overflow hidden too?
[12:36:01] <recurse> the parent being overflow looks right
[12:36:07] <recurse> its your id="mycarousel" that should have overflow
[12:36:12] <recurse> should NOT have
[12:36:23] <recurse> remove overflow:hidden from id="mycarousel"
[12:36:45] <recurse> oh
[12:36:55] <recurse> right, i dont think overflow is valid on UL's anyway
[12:37:14] <recurse> niether are any of those position effects
[12:37:17] <recurse> styles*
[12:37:33] <recurse> if you need too, nest the ul in another div and apply those styles to the new div
[12:37:47] <recurse> the only valid styles on ul are list type etc
[12:38:20] <recurse> unless you display:block your ul, which will produce unwanted results anyway
[12:38:32] <recurse> (certain styles can only be applied to block and inline-block elements)
[12:38:42] <recurse> (eg positon, padding)
[12:38:56] <recurse> (overflow)
[12:39:58] <hugo_moss> the position effects you mean position relative etc?
[12:40:17] <hugo_moss> you think i should set those on the li elements or a nested ul within the mycarousel ul?
[12:40:52] <hugo_moss> oh shit
[12:40:53] <hugo_moss> you're right
[12:40:58] <hugo_moss> you are right
[12:41:02] <hugo_moss> the code that i got it from
[12:41:03] <hugo_moss> does that
[12:41:10] <hugo_moss> he sets not on mycarousel
[12:41:14] <hugo_moss> but on the ul clip
[12:41:20] <hugo_moss> i never noticed that
[12:47:21] <hugo_moss> brb
[12:50:34] <gabrieluk> hi, i have some code with a regex, but i'm not sure exactly what is happening. i wrote some comments and the points where i don't fully understand. http://jsbin.com/uleluz/3/edit
[12:51:51] <guy> What do you guys think about this implementation? https://dev.anuary.com/60244f3a-b8b2-5678-bce5-f7e8742f0c69/
[12:51:52] <guy> any suggestions how to improve it?
[12:52:47] <Kolorbon> Hello, how can I get the n¥t Element of a class? With JS: document.getElementsByClassName("classname")[number]; but $(".classname")[number] does not work. How to do it right?
[12:53:18] <shesek> Kolorbon, it should work, but you'll get an DOM element
[12:53:34] <shesek> you're probably better of with $('.classname:eq(3)') or $('.classname').eq(3)
[12:54:03] <gabrieluk> shesek, what is the difference between the two?
[12:54:18] <Kolorbon> Thanks, because the error console says: document.getElementsByClassName(...)[2].attr is not a function
[12:57:38] <gabrieluk> could you verbosily explain what this code is doing? var matcher = new RegExp( "^" + $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex( request.term ), "i" )
[14:12:05] <zitter> I have a table with radio button in each cell. Is it possible to deselect all radio buttons except the one selected, in selected column?
[14:12:44] <john-dev> yes
[14:13:36] <john-dev> give them all the same class for example and each through that "class", if the actual index is = $(this)., continue
[14:14:01] <zitter> ok
[14:14:45] <zitter> more or less same technique described here, right= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1337759/jquery-select-all-radio-button-group
[14:17:25] <john-dev> zitter, well, the one you posted is even better..
[14:18:27] <zitter> ok thanks again :)
[14:18:47] <john-dev> well, sure :-)
[15:32:28] <dogmatic69> I think I sort of figured out my problem
[15:32:36] <coldhead> great job dogmatic69
[15:32:37] <dogmatic69> I have a lib that is using noConflict()
[15:32:57] <dogmatic69> and after than other jQuery libs wont work :/
[15:33:14] <dogmatic69> DEBUGKIT.$ = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[15:33:34] <dogmatic69> How can I make jquery work like normal again after than lib?
[15:33:50] <gabrieluk> hi, what is the difference between plain regexp in vanilla js and in jquery? any docs comparing both?
[15:34:12] <gabrieluk> i notice jquery needds quotes
[15:34:58] <coldhead> dogmatic69: include jquery, include your other jQuery plugins, THEN call no-conflict and then load the other non-jQ stuff
[15:35:19] <dogmatic69> coldhead: it is jquery though
[15:35:33] <coldhead> gabrieluk: jquery has no special regex handling
[15:35:35] <dogmatic69> script: https://raw.github.com/cakephp/debug_kit/master/webroot/js/js_debug_toolbar.js
[15:35:43] <coldhead> it just uses vanilla regexps
[15:35:52] <coldhead> where are you seeing quotes?
[15:36:27] <gabrieluk> in the jquery-ui code, for the auto complete widget
[15:36:43] <gabrieluk> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[15:36:53] <coldhead> dogmatic69: why do you need noConflict then? maybe this will enlighten: http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[15:37:01] <gabrieluk> it has also quotes for the flag "i"
[15:37:17] <coldhead> oh that's UI, gabrieluk. i'm not sure what their deal is with regexps
[15:37:19] <dogmatic69> coldhead: I did not write that. I would guess it is to work with other code.
[15:38:01] <coldhead> it looks strange to me, dogmatic69
[15:38:08] <coldhead> that's not the idiomatic way to use noConflict
[15:38:38] <gabrieluk> coldhead, are you saying that the jquery-ui project is not tightly integrated with jquery? I mean, if i can code custom jquery, would make more sense to have "my own" autocomplete functionality?
[15:39:10] <coldhead> gabrieluk: no, they are tightly integrated, it's just i'm not tightly integrated with UI enough to tell you what it does special with regexs
[15:39:21] <dogmatic69> coldhead: How would it be done?
[15:39:21] <gabrieluk> cool :)
[15:39:51] <dogmatic69> coldhead: I added $ = DEBUGKIT.$.noConflict(true); which fixed most the errors
[15:39:55] <coldhead> dogmatic69: (function ($) { /* code here can refer to jQuery as $ */ })(jQuery);
[15:39:55] <dogmatic69> (at the end)
[15:40:00] <dogmatic69> ye
[15:40:05] <coldhead> its in that link i provided
[15:40:15] <dogmatic69> let me try that...
[15:40:38] <coldhead> gabrieluk: i would guess that the difference is that UI is letting you provide regexs as strings, rather than literals
[15:40:47] <coldhead> so '/blah/' rather than /blah/
[15:41:16] <gabrieluk> coldhead, in the future, if you got interest on that, i found a good article http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2382497/jquery-ui-autocomplete-widget-search-configuration , but it doesn't explain why the quotes. i guess it passes as a string somehow
[15:41:17] <coldhead> a regex to match a word character like /\w/ as a string needs an extra escape
[15:41:23] <coldhead> '/\\w/'
[15:41:35] <rhizmoe> i'm debugging using console.log $(this) but I'm not seeing the value that is used when I send it to my server via getJSON, is there a method/attr on $(this) I should be using instead?
[15:41:37] <gabrieluk> yep, that is it
[15:41:41] <coldhead> otherwise when the string is parsed it will turn '/\w/' into /w/
[15:41:59] <dogmatic69> coldhead: thanks, I wrapped it all in that and changed the one line to DEBUGKIT.$ = jQuery;
[15:42:03] <coldhead> and that's what their escaping function seems to handle for you
[15:42:12] <dogmatic69> so no more .noConflict(true), all working again
[15:42:50] <coldhead> rhizmoe: in the context of ajax, this is usually the XHR object
[15:44:02] <gabrieluk> coldhead, nice, i didn't know that. so an extra \ if as a string
[15:44:32] <coldhead> yes, you want to escape the escape
[15:44:37] <gabrieluk> but why would someone pass them as a string?
[15:44:39] <coldhead> so it still reaches the regex
[15:44:44] <coldhead> no idea, i would never do that
[15:44:48] <coldhead> i <3 regex literals
[15:44:54] <coldhead> it's one of the nicest things about js
[15:44:56] <rhizmoe> coldhead: i got it with $(this).val() ...i had only tried $(this).val before
[15:45:00] <rhizmoe> (parens)
[15:45:09] <coldhead> ah, good work :)
[15:52:01] <rhizmoe> if my getJSON query returns only a string and not actually JSON, does that mean I should actually be doign a .get with a text return type?
[15:53:46] <gabrieluk> code??
[15:53:53] <coldhead> no rhizmoe, getJSON should return an object
[15:54:00] <coldhead> ?jsonlint @ rhizmoe
[15:54:01] <bot-t> rhizmoe, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[15:54:26] <coldhead> .getJSON('someurl', function (my_obj) { console.log( my_obj ); })
[15:54:33] <coldhead> no need for this
[15:54:33] <mlang> Does anybody have experience with the ddSlick Plugin? I seem to be stuck here.
[15:55:24] <coldhead> i've never heard of that plugin mlang but if you can link to a demo where it's failing someone might still be able to help!
[15:55:41] <rhizmoe> thanks
[15:55:54] <mlang> coldhead: http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/ddSlick - its kind a weird problem, where some of the options don't seem to work.
[15:56:37] <rhizmoe> oh, well i know my return is not valid json, i'm just trying to work with the return. i don't need it to be json, so text is just fine.
[15:56:48] <coldhead> don't use getJSON then
[15:56:52] <coldhead> regular get()
[15:56:55] <coldhead> ?ajax.get
[15:56:58] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[15:56:59] <rhizmoe> right, that was the second half of my question :)
[15:57:10] <rhizmoe> thanks
[15:57:17] <coldhead> very welcome!
[15:57:46] <coldhead> mlang: do you have a link to an example where it doesn't work?
[15:57:55] <coldhead> if the official demo is broken then all hope is lost
[15:58:22] <mlang> coldhead: No, its just in my own setup here - Best to set up a JS fiddle for that?
[15:58:45] <rhizmoe> is "html" effective a "text" return type?
[15:58:51] <rhizmoe> *effectively
[15:59:11] <coldhead> jsfiddle if you can manage, mlang
[15:59:17] <coldhead> or hosted somewhere accessible otherwise
[15:59:30] <coldhead> you can just use "text", rhizmoe
[15:59:31] <rhizmoe> or is it arbitrary, dataType: "gronkulous"
[15:59:34] <mlang> coldhead: I'm fine with the fiddle, but I'm on debugging the plugin right now, I might found the problem.
[15:59:37] <coldhead> if you're expecting text
[15:59:49] <coldhead> keep us posted mlang !
[15:59:51] <coldhead> godspeed
[15:59:57] <rhizmoe> cool. is there a master list of datatypes?
[16:00:06] <mlang> thanks :)
[16:00:55] <coldhead> i would read the source for that, rhizmoe
[16:01:01] <coldhead> it should be in the docs, too
[16:01:14] <coldhead> but html, json, xml, text are the main ones i've ever used
[16:03:14] <u89> rhizmoe: in jquery source search for "accepts:"
[16:09:01] <rhizmoe> great, thanks
[16:09:15] <rhizmoe> i don't suppose anybody has created a guerilla jquery doc site, have they?
[16:10:38] <u89> I have seen one in the past..
[16:18:16] <sunbeam> i'm developing a mobile site, however the slides are not working
[16:18:22] <sunbeam> (just showing them all)
[16:18:24] <gabrieluk> why jquery call a method, such http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Autocomplete#methods     .autocomplete( "destroy" )
[16:18:28] <gabrieluk> ?
[16:18:40] <sunbeam> any idea whats a agood approach to use slides in a mobile css styles
[16:19:05] <gabrieluk> the only thing hanging there, is the argument of autocomplete
[16:19:17] <gabrieluk> changing*
[16:20:13] <coldhead> hey Davey
[16:22:05] <gabrieluk> do I make sense?
[16:22:53] <coldhead> gabrieluk: i guess it's to reduce the number of functions. there's just autocomplete() which does different things depending on the arg
[16:23:04] <coldhead> but i am not really on speaking terms with UI so i can't say for sure
[16:23:08] <gnarf> gabrieluk: in order to preserve the context of the call, you have to have the method be directly on the jQuery object... ie elem.autocomplete() -- the first argument can look for internal methods to the autocomplete widget
[16:23:14] <gnarf> like
[16:23:23] <gnarf> elem.autocomplete.destroy() could NEVER work
[16:23:43] <gnarf> though with some very clever manipulation -- elem.autocomplete().destroy() could work
[16:23:50] <gnarf> but it would break chaining in other ways
[16:24:05] <coldhead> ?cc
[16:24:05] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[16:24:25] <gnarf> elem.autocomplete( "destroy" ) is the best generic approach available...
[16:24:39] <gnarf> you could also elem.data( "autocomplete" ).destroy() but I don't suggest it
[16:24:57] <gnarf> but thats basically what the "widget bridge" (autocomplete function) is doing for you
[16:25:19] <gabrieluk> oky doky
[16:25:44] <gabrieluk> lemme digest :)..
[16:28:10] <shoky> i wouldn't mind elem.autocompleteDestroy(), myself..
[16:28:56] <coldhead> you guys are obsessed with destruction
[16:29:29] <gnarf> shoky: um - that would be an insane amount of namespace bloat
[16:31:02] <tw2113> $('#anarchy').init();
[16:31:03] <shoky> well yeah, .autocomplete.destroy() would be nicer
[16:33:42] <gnarf> shoky: impossible tho
[16:33:53] <gnarf> .autocomplete is a fn on the prototype - so its context is useless
[16:34:37] <gnarf> eventually you go back to "oh yeah, .autocomplete('destroy') isn't that bad I guess"
[16:34:38] <shoky> yepp
[16:34:40] <gnarf> :)
[16:34:44] <gabrieluk> so what is the typeOf .autocomplete?
[16:34:52] <gnarf> gabrieluk: function
[16:34:53] <shoky> function
[16:35:01] <gabrieluk> ah, i thought that also
[16:35:48] <gnarf> in UI - that particular function is called the widget bridge -- the function on the prototype that bridges to the widget
[16:36:10] <gnarf> creates / options / etc
[16:36:59] <gabrieluk> nice
[16:37:10] <gnarf> afk a bit
[16:39:46] <coldhead> there are trolls under the bridges
[16:40:10] <gabrieluk> lol
[16:40:44] <sunbeam> Any easy way I can have img in percentages always displaying 100% width?
[16:41:28] <gabrieluk> yes, css
[16:44:43] <gabrieluk> max-width: 100%;
[16:45:15] <sunbeam> ok
[16:45:19] <sunbeam> and how do I set the height?
[16:45:24] <gabrieluk> auto
[16:45:34] <sunbeam> because if i don't set the height to a px or % size for the slider it wont display
[17:20:35] <rhizmoe> does a .success in an ajax .get not get fired if the request comes back 304?
[17:20:56] <rhizmoe> i'm having weird callback behavior
[17:42:05] <hugo_moss> can someone test if http://edtcorp.net16.net responds
[17:42:25] <hugo_moss> its down for me
[17:42:31] <hugo_moss> i crashed the server
[17:44:52] <coldhead> ?down edtcorp.net16.net
[17:44:55] <bot-t> coldhead, It's just you. - http://edtcorp.net16.net is up.
[17:45:01] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[17:45:01] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[17:45:16] <hugo_moss> how do i clear my cache?
[17:45:25] <hugo_moss> how come i cant connect?
[17:46:00] <coldhead> search google for clear dns cache <your OS here>
[17:46:05] <hugo_moss> yea
[17:46:08] <hugo_moss> i tried rebooting
[17:46:17] <hugo_moss> then doing ipconfig /flushdns
[17:46:18] <hugo_moss> for windows
[17:46:21] <hugo_moss> no cigar
[17:46:44] <coldhead> might be your router?
[17:46:56] <hugo_moss> yea
[17:47:15] <coldhead> can you hit it via ip? 31.170.161.56
[17:47:25] <coldhead> nope
[17:47:30] <coldhead> bah
[17:47:35] <hugo_moss> nope
[17:47:43] <coldhead> add it to your hosts file?
[17:47:45] <hugo_moss> it was working and then it crashed
[17:48:00] <hugo_moss> and now i cant connect
[17:48:15] <coldhead> restart your network?
[17:48:22] <hugo_moss> good idea
[17:48:25] <hugo_moss> thank you
[18:01:14] <Satoebbi> ohai. here is my code with commented question. http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/mPAxN/15/
[18:01:16] <hugo_moss> coldhead: rebooted my router, rebooted my pc, flushed my dns, cleared my browsers cache. still no cigar
[18:01:22] <hugo_moss> maybe its blocking my ip?
[18:02:35] <Satoebbi> hugo_moss : i was out, can you repeat your problem pls? or /msg
[18:03:20] <hugo_moss> ok
[18:03:27] <hugo_moss> well i cant connecto my website
[18:03:31] <hugo_moss> http://edtcorp.net16.net
[18:03:36] <coldhead> maybe it is blocking your IP
[18:03:41] <coldhead> it's up for the rest of the internet
[18:04:01] <hugo_moss> and i rebooted my router, rebooted my pc, flushed my dns cache, and flushed my browsers cache
[18:04:04] <hugo_moss> cant connect
[18:05:09] <Satoebbi> there is a lot of alert() on it, check your firewall or adblock programs..
[18:05:10] <hugo_moss> yea its blocking my ip
[18:05:24] <hugo_moss> nah the thing was i was making alot of requests to the server
[18:05:27] <hugo_moss> and it blocked my ip
[18:05:31] <hugo_moss> thats what i think it is
[18:05:33] <coldhead> you made it angry!
[18:05:36] <hugo_moss> the alerts are just for debugging
[18:05:42] <hugo_moss> i had a bug in the program
[18:05:50] <hugo_moss> in the website javascript
[18:05:58] <hugo_moss> and it was making requests from my computer to the server
[18:06:03] <tw2113> stop angering people coldhead, you're new
[18:06:03] <hugo_moss> like repeatedly
[18:06:16] <Satoebbi> okay for debugging.. but most browsers, malicious program remover and other stuff blocking site like this
[18:06:21] <hugo_moss> now what do i have to do wait it out? call the hosting company?
[18:06:55] <Satoebbi> clean your code and try another browser
[18:07:10] <coldhead> hugo_moss: there might be an admin panel for that server
[18:07:11] <hugo_moss> tried the other browsers
[18:07:17] <hugo_moss> good idea
[18:07:17] <coldhead> where you can whitelist yourself and remove the block
[18:07:25] <hugo_moss> there is a control panel
[18:07:28] <hugo_moss> thank you again sir
[18:07:28] <coldhead> hopefully that's on a different address
[18:08:28] <hugo_moss> hmm it says no blocked ips
[18:09:01] <coldhead> at this point i would contact support and catch up on some arthouse movies while i waited
[18:09:03] <hugo_moss> but only to deny, not whitelist
[18:09:12] <hugo_moss> yes sir
[18:10:12] <felipe_Brz> anybody knows why this http://pastie.org/5399104 is causing *two* log messages to be fired upon mouse entering the matched div?
[18:10:26] <Satoebbi> hugo_moss you can ping 31.170.161.56?
[18:11:14] <hugo_moss> yea
[18:11:16] <hugo_moss> satoebbi
[18:11:21] <hugo_moss> 0% loss
[18:11:40] <Satoebbi> then you can connect on ftp and remove your alerts.. try it
[18:11:51] <hugo_moss> ok
[18:13:28] <hugo_moss> that wont let me connect
[18:13:32] <hugo_moss> but whatever
[18:13:35] <hugo_moss> i removed the alerts
[18:13:38] <hugo_moss> uploaded the new files
[18:13:57] <Satoebbi> now clean the cache
[18:14:41] <Satoebbi> alaert still for me
[18:14:58] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: you probably want http://pastie.org/5399117
[18:15:26] <hugo_moss> yea i uploaded the new files with no alerts
[18:15:30] <hugo_moss> im still getting alerts
[18:15:33] <hugo_moss> but, now i can connect
[18:15:38] <hugo_moss> i think i was removed from the block
[18:15:42] <hugo_moss> im connecting to it now
[18:15:44] <hugo_moss> but theres alerts
[18:15:51] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: without the bogus setTimeout i mean
[18:16:40] <felipe_Brz> coldhead:  i started off by doing that... but whenever I used 'on', then jquery would not recognize 'mouseenter' event, only 'hover' event.... no idea why
[18:16:51] <felipe_Brz> tis why i turned to setTimeout, i don't like it either
[18:17:19] <Satoebbi> hugo_moss : debug in other way.. not with alerts. you can put a floating div and .text()
[18:17:23] <hugo_moss> ok the alerts are gone
[18:17:27] <hugo_moss> its not the alerts
[18:17:30] <hugo_moss> its a bug in the program
[18:17:33] <hugo_moss> its making requests
[18:17:38] <hugo_moss> constantly downloading from the server
[18:17:45] <hugo_moss> have to figure that out
[18:18:45] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: i had the arguments in the wrong order: http://jsfiddle.net/YJb7r/
[18:19:28] <Satoebbi> how can i effect only the hovered elements child? $(this).. ? http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/mPAxN/15/
[18:19:49] <Satoebbi> .. element's child
[18:22:53] <tklun> $(this).find('.description).animate()
[18:23:12] <tklun> except with the correct punctuation and syntax...
[18:23:19] <coldhead> Satoebbi: http://jsfiddle.net/mPAxN/21/
[18:23:37] <felipe_Brz> coldhead:  yes your example works... mine still doesn't but it's probably my fault.. i have multiple event listeners i guess they might be conflicting with each other
[18:23:58] <Satoebbi> thx tkun, and i find another one $(this).children() wich is more effective?
[18:24:01] <coldhead> well that's not going to be fixed by setTimeout
[18:24:08] <tklun> i think coldhead's approach is probably better
[18:24:21] <coldhead> coldhead's approach requires less typing
[18:24:26] <tklun> agreed
[18:24:39] <Satoebbi> true. thx cobalt238_
[18:24:43] <coldhead> what language is this Satoebbi ?
[18:24:52] <Satoebbi> true. thx coldhead
[18:24:52] <Satoebbi> :)
[18:24:57] <coldhead> "√âlelmiszer, z√∂lds√©g, k√©sz√©tel" ?
[18:24:59] <Satoebbi> hungarian
[18:25:03] <coldhead> oh lovely
[18:25:07] <Satoebbi> :)
[18:25:29] <coldhead> food vegetable ready meals
[18:25:33] <coldhead> the hungarian is much nicer
[18:25:56] <Satoebbi> :) not an easy language.. but wery rich
[18:26:27] <Satoebbi> salmost like chinese and other ancient asian languages
[18:26:32] <Satoebbi> -s
[18:26:36] <coldhead> yes that is what i heard
[18:28:08] <felipe_Brz> coldhead:  if I have multiple 'on's for an element listening for mouseenter events on different selectors, can they hinder each other?
[18:28:40] <coldhead> not really, felipe_Brz
[18:28:54] <coldhead> only if the actual functions interfere with each other
[18:28:59] <coldhead> they should all still run
[18:29:05] <coldhead> do you want to show us the coe?
[18:29:07] <coldhead> code*
[18:30:13] <Satoebbi> there is any way to bring life the 'auto' option in animate? // .animate({ 'height': 'auto' })
[18:30:13] <felipe_Brz> i think i've nailed down where the bug is
[18:30:16] <felipe_Brz> i'll post
[18:30:46] <coldhead> ?slideDown @ Satoebbi
[18:30:47] <bot-t> Satoebbi, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[18:31:52] <Satoebbi> nice, thank you bot-t
[18:32:17] <coldhead> Satoebbi: http://jsfiddle.net/mPAxN/22/
[18:32:46] <Satoebbi> i love you guys!
[18:33:09] <scriptThis> Can I use jQuery to click a link on a "foreign" domain? ie, give it a link that is outside the domain the jQuery is running on? Or will same origin policy stop this in all cases?
[18:33:10] <coldhead> #jQuery loves you
[18:34:14] <tw2113> *pats coldhead* you keep believing that
[18:35:17] <coldhead> ?p @ scriptThis
[18:35:17] <bot-t> scriptThis, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:35:24] <coldhead> let's see what you're trying to do :D
[18:35:59] <scriptThis> No code to share, just asking if it's possible, is there something equivalent to Mechanize for jQuery?
[18:37:04] <jael> hey guys im having an issue with slideDown().. basically not working. Is there something that I'm missing? slideToggle() works, but makes it disappear everytime i scroll back to var top... http://pastebin.com/RC7j78J7
[18:37:29] <jael> it's on my personal dev site: http://jldesignloft.com
[18:38:07] <coldhead> i don't know what that is sorry scriptThis
[18:40:05] <scriptThis> I want to click an HREF with jQuery, but on a site I don't host.
[18:40:41] <tw2113> how do you click something with jquery?
[18:40:42] <coldhead> oh no, that won't work
[18:40:48] <coldhead> .trigger('click;)
[18:41:06] <coldhead> jael: the problem is that while the animation is in progress
[18:41:06] <tw2113> freaky
[18:41:14] <coldhead> you are adding display:fixed
[18:41:23] <coldhead> and display is block for the animation
[18:41:35] <coldhead> it might work if you add the class before you slide
[18:41:39] <coldhead> but i'm not sure
[18:41:55] <coldhead> sticky menus are hard, i use a plugin rather than roll my own
[18:42:23] <jael> coldhead ill try that. yeah sticky menus are tricky.. but fun!
[18:42:28] <jael> ill give it a try
[18:42:33] <coldhead> good luck
[18:42:45] <coldhead> nice site, btw
[18:44:10] <relipse> in jquery how can i get the parent <td> element in for example <td><label><select></label></td> of the <select>
[18:44:23] <relipse> (I don't know how deep it is nested)
[18:44:33] <relipse> I just know that it is a child/grand-child of a <td>
[18:44:52] <jael> coldhead thanks!
[18:45:21] <coldhead> ?closest @ relipse
[18:45:21] <bot-t> relipse, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:45:27] <coldhead> $(this).closest('td') usually
[18:45:36] <tklun> relipse, try .closest or .parents
[18:45:52] <tklun> closest gives you the current element as well, parents does not
[18:47:25] <felipe_Brz> coldhead:  there element whose mouseenter event i'm trying to capture has 'position:absolute;' .. could this be the cause I can't seem to be able to catch the event?
[18:48:12] <coldhead> not likely, felipe_Brz
[18:48:31] <coldhead> if you right click on the element and choose Inspect Element...
[18:48:38] <tklun> felipe_Brz, could there be something z-indexed on top of it?
[18:48:44] <coldhead> if that opens the right thing in the debugger then that should be okay
[18:48:46] <coldhead> tklun++
[18:49:48] <felipe_Brz> tklun:  there could
[18:50:08] <felipe_Brz> but i've overriden it on chrome so that it has z-index of 9999
[18:50:16] <felipe_Brz> and still my events aren't caught
[18:52:33] <tklun> coldhead's trick with the inspector might help
[18:54:30] <felipe_Brz> hmmm ok looks ok
[18:54:34] <felipe_Brz> all looks ok*
[18:54:41] <coldhead> got a link felipe_Brz?
[18:54:49] <felipe_Brz> funny thing is that on('hover') works
[18:55:57] <felipe_Brz> coldhead:  sorry but I've no idea how to reproduce it on jsfiddle, it's on my dev box
[18:56:22] <coldhead> are you sure you're spelling mouseenter correctly?
[18:56:50] <coldhead> cause if that's all it is that would be awesome
[18:57:21] <felipe_Brz> http://pastie.org/5399211
[18:57:24] <felipe_Brz> yeah
[18:58:22] <felipe_Brz> the way this was built with css is kind of dodgy... it's a calendar plugin but the stuff that's inside each day tile isn't *logically* inside the tile div
[18:58:38] <felipe_Brz> it's added later on and then styled absolutely to look like it's inside the tile
[18:58:40] <felipe_Brz> maybe that's why
[18:58:41] <coldhead> what about mouseover instead of mouseenter
[18:58:47] <coldhead> i am grapping at straws, yes
[18:59:07] <coldhead> ew that's tricky
[18:59:38] <felipe_Brz> mouseover doesn't work either
[18:59:46] <coldhead> bugger
[18:59:49] <felipe_Brz> anyway, it's not a showstopper i guess
[18:59:57] <coldhead> you could just use hover
[19:00:04] <felipe_Brz> yes but
[19:00:05] <coldhead> and provide a second function argument that does nothing
[19:00:17] <coldhead> so it would overall be the same as mouseenter
[19:00:18] <felipe_Brz> it's only firing up upon mouseleave
[19:00:27] <coldhead> oh my sweet lord
[19:00:34] <coldhead> i'd better go to lunch then
[19:00:37] <coldhead> good luck
[19:00:43] <relipse> lets say i have a td, how can I get the next row's td (same column)?
[19:01:17] <coldhead> ?index
[19:01:17] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[19:01:22] <felipe_Brz> anyway, thanks for helping coldhead
[19:01:32] <coldhead> ignore that precis, it will tell you the index position
[19:01:35] <coldhead> and you can use that
[19:02:18] <coldhead> var n = $(this).index(); $(this).closest('tr').find('td:nth(' + n + ')')
[19:02:23] <coldhead> something like that
[19:02:52] * coldhead lunches
[19:03:08] <relipse> thanks coldhead i'll be looking at it
[19:06:21] <userXP> please can help me 2 sec, don't take to much http://pastebin.com/7Qha6WHe
[19:06:34] <userXP> is something wrong tere?
[19:07:00] <userXP> TypeError: document.getElementById(this.subcontainers[i]) is null
[19:07:07] <tw2113> i don't see any jquery
[19:07:08] <userXP> i take that error
[19:07:14] <userXP> i know
[19:07:16] <userXP> sorry
[19:07:44] <userXP> if iou can help me please
[19:08:02] <relipse> coldhead, it is not working, it is not finding the next 'tr' element, it is finding the current one
[19:08:43] <tklun> what about $(this).next('tr')
[19:09:13] <rhizmoe> this guy makes the get call, but doesn't run the success: block, and I'm lost as to why: http://jsfiddle.net/GDyhc/2/
[19:10:06] <rhizmoe> in case it matters, that's compiled output from coffeescript.
[19:10:40] <relipse> tklun: ok apparently this worked:
[19:10:49] <relipse> var nr_td = $(td).parent('tr').next().find('td:nth(' + n + ')')[0];
[19:12:28] <tklun> yeah, i can see that working, as long as you don't plan on changing the structure of your markup

[19:43:26] <relipse> does anyone want to check out my new time logger for contract programmers? www.cworklog.com
[19:59:06] <letterpress> the attribute equals selector doesn't seem to select data elements that have been set by .data(). Is there any selector that can?
[20:02:22] <pachet> letterpress: passing values into .data() doesn't affect the attributes of the corresponding element(s) in the DOM
[20:04:55] <pachet> letterpress: the .data() object just does you the favor of enumerating its properties to match the data- prefixed attributes on the element
[20:09:58] <letterpress> pachet: so it seems like there's no jQuery method to select elements based on their data attributes?
[20:19:51] <pachet> letterpress: $('span[data-foo="bar"]') ?
[20:20:35] <pachet> if you want to add a custom data attribute on the fly, set it manually with .attr()
[20:20:49] <pachet> then you'd be able to grab that element via that attribute in a selector
[20:22:14] <letterpress> yeah that's the method that i've see recommended, but it doesn't seem to be working when i set the data attribute with .data().
[20:22:22] <pachet> no, like i told you
[20:22:36] <snover> $.fn.data does not set attributes, dawg
[20:22:42] <pachet> modifying .data() is just changing the internal object that jquery has associated with that element
[20:22:47] <letterpress> sure.
[20:22:53] <pachet> it just takes its queue from the data- attribs on the element
[20:23:01] <snover> cue
[20:23:07] <pachet> koo
[20:23:10] <snover> blu
[20:24:20] <letterpress> ‚Ä¶and i hear how i can just use attr() but that seems like a step backwards. i'm cool with that though if that's what it takes.
[20:24:46] <snover> it was a step backward to have $.fn.data try to pull data from html attributes
[20:24:56] <pachet> $.fn._old_data = $.fn.data; $.fn.data = function ( primary, secondary ) { if ( typeof secondary !== 'undefined' ) $(this).attr('data-' + primary, secondary); $.fn._old_data.apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)); };
[20:25:00] <pachet> ;[
[20:25:21] <pachet> i've been drinking but i'm still sober enough to not recommend that^
[20:25:38] <pachet> s/recommend that/recommend that too highly
[20:26:30] <letterpress> ha! yeah i won't go there. just‚Ä¶.
[20:32:58] <letterpress> snover just curious about your step backward comment, bc it's been really useful (for me) to have jquery pull data attributes from the html. the server can load the page and hand off values to JS pretty easily this way. just wondering what a better approach would be.
[20:33:22] <snover> um. in that very specific case, using the attr method because that‚Äôs what it is for
[20:34:40] <snover> in a more general ‚Äúhow do i send data to a web app from the server‚Äù sense, the answer is that the DOM is not a data store and you should be passing your data using an Ajax-based api
[20:34:50] <snover> like json-rest
[20:35:01] <pachet> ^
[20:35:20] <letterpress> ok that makes sense.
[20:42:18] <letterpress> i have a feeling a lot of people read the documentation for .data() and start loading up the DOM with data-* attributes at page load.
[20:47:43] <syskk> let's say I have a very long list of checkbox inputs. is there any jquery plugin that can help me filter it? (by label or value)
[21:20:31] <coldhead> syskk: can't you just use regular jQuery selectors to filter it?
[21:20:59] <syskk> right, guess that wouldnt be too hard
[21:21:29] <coldhead> it's less cognitive load too
[21:21:43] <coldhead> for anyone looking at it later they only need to know jQuery, not jQuery + a plugin
[21:23:27] <tw2113> coldhead, jquery gets a lot of "is there a plugin to do XYZ", doesn't it
[21:23:45] <coldhead> it's because there are so many plugins
[21:23:48] <coldhead> and they're so easy to do
[21:23:55] <coldhead> i'm doing a couple right now
[21:24:07] <tw2113> freak :D
[21:24:25] <coldhead> i'm not really
[21:24:33] <coldhead> the only time i've ever done one was for a job interview
[21:24:43] <tw2113> shame
[21:25:53] <coldhead> help end plugin proliferation!

[21:30:04] <relipse>  any hourly contract programmers want to try out my new work log app cworklog.com ?
[21:36:12] <execut3> relipse, a quick user, email, password on the homepage would be better. that long signup page (tho mostly optional) scared me away :)
[21:44:17] <aqeel> hi room
[21:47:08] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: are you around perchance?
[21:47:08] <coldhead> hi aqeel
[21:47:46] <coldhead> it's late for scott, sgharms. try US daytime!
[21:48:05] <sgharms> coldhead: /whereis scott?
[21:48:13] * sgharms is in US :)
[21:49:02] <coldhead> he's in NC
[21:49:15] <coldhead> probably spending his sunday evening with his nearest and dearest
[21:49:23] <sgharms> coldhead: on the wrong side :)
[21:49:41] <coldhead> he hasn't tweeted since the 17th so... maybe something terrible has happened
[21:49:48] <sgharms> Dead man's switch!
[21:49:50] <sgharms> log you out of irc
[21:50:34] <coldhead> you should suggest that to him
[21:51:07] <coldhead> i wonder if you can get a medic alert bracelet that says "In the event of my death please disconnect all my network services"
[21:54:11] <sgharms> and `rm -rf /volumes/secret/private/no/really/dont/look/here/media`

[22:24:57] <agu10^_> can i run jQuery serverside on Node.js?
[22:25:34] <snover> whatever you are thinking of doing by doing that is wrong and you should stop thinking it right now
