[00:00:08] <javaman> does anyone know what .height() seems to return an extra .5 in v16.2.1 ?
[00:00:13] <javaman> err why
[00:01:33] <ravenzz> it doesn't
[00:01:44] <ravenzz> ?demo
[00:01:49] <ravenzz> fuck. no bot
[00:01:55] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[00:02:06] <ravenzz> you can reproduce it on jsfiddle.net
[00:02:20] <javaman> i havent tried that yet, let me go do that
[00:08:56] <madprops> if(safe alert('ii1i0))
[00:12:53] <javaman> weird, doesn't repro in ie8 or jsfiddle.net, only in my firefox6
[00:25:04] <Rinthe> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/highlight-all-links-to-current-page/ is this smart? it seems like a lot of work for jquery
[00:25:59] <punno> hey all, just wondering what the most efficient way to loop over all of an elements data attributes?
[00:27:57] <bricker> punno: you can call the #attributes method on any ActiveRecord object, which will return a hash with attributes names as keys and values as values
[00:30:53] <punno> hmm
[00:30:54] <ravenzz> punno http://jsfiddle.net/g3R2c/
[00:32:54] <punno> aha, its a pitty theres no way of doing it without having to return ALL the attributes considering the recent addition of all the data methods
[00:33:25] <punno> im working on something that will take an element with data attributes and bind them all the the properties of a new class instance
[00:34:35] <punno> hang on, hmm
[00:35:39] <punno> derr
[00:35:49] <punno> console.log($(el).data());
[00:38:13] <Rinthe> why doesn't this work? http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/highlight-all-links-to-current-page/
[00:38:31] <ravenzz> ask to your console :o
[00:39:01] <Rinthe> ravenzz: how?
[00:39:26] <punno> politely!
[00:40:26] <ravenzz> inspect a link, and check if it has the class selected
[00:40:50] <ravenzz> if yes, you need just the css
[00:41:02] <ravenzz> otherwise...look at the console for errors
[00:41:56] <ravenzz> also window.location.pathname returns the current URL path without the domain
[00:43:26] <Rinthe> ravenzz: it didn't add the class i wanted it to
[00:43:46] <ravenzz> just try $(document).ready(function() { $('a').addClass("selected"); });
[00:44:16] <ravenzz> or $(document).ready(function() { $('a[href]').addClass("selected"); });
[00:45:29] <Rinthe> that works ravenzz
[00:46:11] <ravenzz> Rinthe the purpose of the css-tricks code snippet is different
[00:46:21] <ravenzz> This function will add the class "selected" to any links (even relative) that point to the current page.
[00:46:51] <Rinthe> what does "even relative" mean?
[00:47:30] <ravenzz> Have you ever heard about relative and absolute paths?
[00:48:31] <Rinthe> not really, but i kind of get what it means
[00:48:39] <Rinthe> but it's not highlighting anything
[00:48:49] <Rinthe> no classes are showing up
[00:48:58] <Rinthe> even teh absolute links arent highlighting
[00:51:48] <Rinthe> can anyone help?
[01:11:14] <haibtdt> could someone help me build a simple image slider?
[01:11:31] <haibtdt> thank
[01:13:03] <oquidave_> hello guys, can i push an array as a get parameter while making a jqeury ajax call to the server...like http://pastebin.com/Y0UfZueB
[01:15:39] <haibtdt> any experts here?
[01:15:58] <haibtdt> :-(
[01:16:21] <punno> you want to use an array of key/values as the get param?
[01:17:14] <oquidave_> punno, no the value itself is an array
[01:17:52] <punno> what do you mean no? i was asking a question
[01:19:47] <oquidave_> punno, i what want to pass an array(which is a value) through get ....like contacts.php?ids='contacts_id_array'
[01:20:05] <punno> just pass the array into the data param
[01:21:35] <oquidave_> punno, okay let me try that
[01:21:37] <punno> so replace {option:'delete_nos', ids:contact_id_arr} with contact_id_array
[01:21:42] <punno> as long as its valid
[01:21:46] <punno> whatever it returns, that is
[01:22:08] <oquidave_> punno, okay thanks, let me try that
[01:54:51] <lonimurar> http://jsfiddle.net/dgpcT/1/ - how can I call myFunction from another script (same page)?
[02:04:54] <Spockz> hmm, when I sat the value of an element to '' with .val('') the dom updates but I still see the original content in the browser. When I change to .val('smth') I see the change in the browser too
[02:10:30] <xover> I have a jQuery UI Widget Factory-based plugin that for practical reasons has to .hide() the element it's called on and create a new element to display its UI.
[02:11:06] <xover> Problem is, now the Widget Factory magic is attached to the hidden elementand not on the visible widget where the user of the plugin would expect to find it and be able to call plugin methods on it.
[02:12:11] <xover> So, is there any (non-insane, non-fragile) way to attach the widget factory magic to the new element as well?
[02:12:31] <xover> Or “instead of” would work too.
[02:15:56] <xover> I suppose .clone() might work, but then I'd have to find some way to alter it from a UL to a DIV in the same operation.
[02:19:14] <xover> Hmm. Or is the magic really just in $('#widget').data('pluginname') so I could manually copy that over and get the effect I'm after?
[02:22:52] <xover> Anyone recall any articles, docs, blog posts, etc. that even vaguely touch on these kinds of issues?
[03:32:02] <antonio__> hey folks
[03:56:35] <antonio__> is anyone around?
[03:57:22] <dr0id> nope
[03:57:48] <antonio__> damn
[03:58:05] <antonio__> so I'm trying to get this slider thing (http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tabs/slideshow.html) to work on my wordpress site to no avail
[04:02:05] <Fox___> is there something similar to ready(), but instead loads before everything else?
[04:15:53] <HM2K_> antonio__ jquery tools is a fucking nightmare :p
[04:16:14] <antonio__> is it?
[04:16:32] <HM2K_> yeah, the lib they include is for an old version of jquery
[04:17:59] <HM2K_> https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/issues/459

[05:15:27] <krogant> hi, in terms of loading images like: $('#someimg').src('images/somewhere/' + $('#foo').val()); is this vulnerable to xss?
[05:18:07] <Vivid_> this is borked, not even getting the alert... http://pastebin.com/9dHWvkis i'm a newb btw, any ideas?
[05:29:47] <Vivid_> checking out firebug and i've got this... "$ is not defined", does that mean that jquery hasn't been loaded?
[05:31:31] <krogant> Vivid_: yes
[05:33:45] <Vivid_> sweet, i figure it out, got more errors in my code, but at least I can work with it now :o)
[05:34:30] <Vivid_> I googled "google hosted jquery" or something similar and landed on this page... http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[05:34:38] <Vivid_> The code snippet doesn't work
[05:35:02] <Vivid_> this works for me though... <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[05:37:11] <gemclip> i like <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js">
[05:37:39] <misterm> Vivid_: which snippet do you mean? which one doesn't work?
[05:37:48] <gemclip> but i like pain
[05:38:25] <Vivid_> from the URL above... <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[05:38:42] <oquidave_> hello guys, jquery's $('element').each(); fn to iterate through some values of the elemets, each time seperating them with a comma, but i don't want the last comma on the last iteration like...http://pastebin.com/zXCSJC1D
[05:38:56] <misterm> Vivid_: well I'd note that article is from 2008
[05:39:41] <misterm> Vivid_: also, random blog articles won't neccesarily be completely correct, so if you have something that works go with that
[05:40:34] <Vivid_> cool misterm, lesson learnt, funny that its page rank is so high though
[05:42:36] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[05:42:50] <gyzmodo> i've problem with jcarousel, it shows only 1 image, when i resize browser's windows it shows other 3 images
[06:12:36] <oquidave_> hello isn't this how you get the length of checked items? $('form input:checkbox:checked').len();
[06:16:09] <oquidave_> i got it $('form input:checkbox:checked').length();
[06:25:21] <dr0id> any idea why rate_field = new_row.find('input.value_holder[name*=rate]').val(data['sell_price']).change(); won't work (as in not fire the change() event) ? I can't setup a testcase really. calling rate_field.change(); from chrome dev tools works though
[06:26:36] <pissypaw> hi there. i'm a noob trying to install mezzanine. after i ran syncdb and then migrate I get "You are in a dry run, and cannot access the ORM." can't find anything useful by searching. when i try to access the site it says "Caught DatabaseError while rendering: no such table: pages_page". any ideas on what I should try?
[06:27:18] <pissypaw> i guess mysql and django (or mezzanine) aren't getting along. is the migrate stuff to do with south?
[06:27:34] <Stava> I'm trying to prepend a list item to an ordered list, but the prepended item won't show the list-style-type/number. I'm running firefox 6 - http://jsbin.com/udoruc
[06:28:42] <pissypaw> oops
[06:28:47] <pissypaw> wrong channel. sorry.
[06:30:28] <pissypaw> Stava: maybe your css defines only the <ol> or the <ul>?
[06:30:45] <pissypaw> Stava: check out what the prepended html looks like with firebug
[06:30:46] <Stava> pissypaw, there is no css
[06:36:39] <pissypaw> Stava: works for me in chrome
[06:36:43] <pissypaw> your code example
[06:36:59] <Stava> pissypaw, For me as well, but not in firefox 6
[06:37:07] <pissypaw> i hear firefox 6 is a dog
[06:37:24] <Stava> Chrome would show (1. three, 2. one, 3. one), firefox 6 (three, 1. one, 3. three)
[06:37:49] <Stava> Made a typo, but im sure you get it
[06:40:08] <learn2hack> join #python
[06:42:19] <pissypaw> Stava: works fine in firefox 6
[06:42:30] <pissypaw> sorry
[06:42:37] <pissypaw> Stava: i mean it works fine in firefox 5
[06:42:41] <pissypaw> so it must be a ff6 bug
[06:42:49] <Stava> pissypaw, Seems i need to hide the item after adding it to the list, not before as im doing now
[06:43:44] <pissypaw> Stava: yeah you should not put actions in a variable
[06:44:02] <learn2hack> Folks! any small issue to get started on contributing to jquery

[06:45:06] <noobie25> I have form (initially hidden) ... and a div selector to "show" the form.   I use jquery to create a cancel button to hide the form.  This works only once and doesn't show the form again... any help?   Here is the pastie  http://pastebin.com/jB1FB3cb
[06:45:10] <Stava> pissypaw, Exactly, seems to work fine now
[06:47:23] <blessYAHU> anyone know of a good backbonejs channel?
[06:47:52] <misterm> #documentcloud?
[06:48:40] <blessYAHU> thanks.
[06:49:41] <misterm> np
[06:53:59] <noobie25> my form toggle doesn't seem to work correctly.... it only works once.  Here is the paste http://pastebin.com/jB1FB3cb
[06:59:24] <misterm> noobie25: what happens?
[07:00:45] <misterm> noobie25: what is $(this).append("Cancel") supposed to be doing? is that cick handler firing?
[07:00:48] <noobie25> misterm,   form is initially hidden (correct).   When I click on the "divshowform"  the form shows (correct).  Also I see a cancel text (correct).   when i click on cancel form disappears (correct).   When i click again the "divshowform"  nothing happens (
[07:01:51] <misterm> noobie25: why not just have the cancel button be part of the form initially?
[07:02:35] <noobie25> misterm,   I may need to put the "cancel" text in its own div ... but i thought i can chain it like this.
[07:03:12] <misterm> noobie25: which chaining are you refering to?
[07:03:29] <misterm> noobie25: it just seems to me this is unneccesary
[07:03:34] <noobie25> referring to:  $(this).append("Cancel").click(function () {
[07:03:38] <misterm> noobie25: you have a show button, and a hide button
[07:04:10] <misterm> noobie25: $(showbutton).click(function(){ form.show();]); $(hidbutton).click(function(){ form.hide() });
[07:04:46] <noobie25> misterm,  ok...i don't know what i was thinking... i should have had two handlers from the start.
[07:05:07] <misterm> it happens
[07:05:35] <noobie25> misterm,   thanks.   by the way,  what do you use to display a form (nice popup type maybe).
[07:05:54] <Acorn> How can I run some code only once all the images within an element have loaded?
[07:05:58] <noobie25> misterm,  and it dims everything else....  i saw many kinds and was wondering what you used.
[07:06:18] <Acorn> the element is being dynamically inserted into the page, and once it has been inserted I need to run a function on it.. but only once its images have loaded
[07:06:24] <misterm> noobie25: sounds like you want something like a lightbox
[07:06:40] <noobie25> thanks:)
[07:21:54] <Stava> Can i make .fadeIn() block/stop and return once the animation is complete?
[07:22:03] <Stava> or would this be bad practice
[07:28:40] <misterm> Stava: block/stop what?
[07:29:06] <Stava> misterm, code execution
[07:29:21] <misterm> Stava: if you do that, how is the animation going to complete?
[07:29:50] <Stava> misterm, My actual problem is that I have an array of comments i want to display one by one
[07:29:55] <misterm> Stava: you can pass a callback to the animation to do once it's complete if that's what you mean
[07:30:10] <Stava> So the second should render/animate after the first is done, and the third after the second is done and so on
[07:30:40] <Stava> misterm, I know, but that might be problematic when the list of comments to display is not constant
[07:32:01] <misterm> Stava: how so?
[07:33:42] <Stava> misterm, I dont see any practical way to queue the animations, unless I use a block-flag
[07:35:21] <misterm> Stava: what do you mean? you just queue them and each animation fires the next in the queue (if any) when it completes
[07:36:11] <Stava> misterm, http://pastebin.com/fq14U5u1
[07:36:16] <Stava> Which I dont think is a good solution
[07:38:12] <misterm> Stava: it's not just not good, it's not possible: js is single threaded
[07:38:26] <misterm> Stava: unless in that loop you were doing the animating or something
[07:38:46] <Stava> misterm, Right, thats what I suspected
[07:38:53] <misterm> Stava: but anyway, yea you should be able to do it by using an animation queue
[07:39:06] <Stava> Is that a function of jquery? animation queue
[07:40:28] <misterm> Stava: jQuery has an internal animation queue, or you could do it yourself
[07:41:18] <Stava> I suppose you're talking about the queue() function? misterm
[07:41:39] <misterm> Stava: queue() etc, eys
[07:41:41] <misterm> *yes
[07:44:55] <Stava> misterm, Should I do something like this? http://pastie.org/2401893
[07:46:28] <Stava> Well, obviously (i guess), it doesn't work

[09:10:15] <theCole> any jquery contributors in the room?
[09:10:26] <theCole> have a question about the perf tests
[09:14:35] <Elephant> howdy, I can't seem to google this well, but basically, when I'm using the fadeToggle() function, I don't want the div/span to lose its space on the page.
[09:15:03] <Elephant> so like I want the space that is fading out to remain blank while the ajax comes back with an answer and then fades back in
[09:15:28] <Elephant> and now it's disappearing for a fraction of a second causing the whole page to jump
[09:15:45] <Elephant> I imagine this is something I could probably fix with css
[09:16:10] <Elephant> If that makes any sense :)
[09:16:18] <min|dvir|us> Hi. How do I get the element after a particular element that matches a certain criterium?
[09:18:01] <misterm> min|dvir|us: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:18:15] <min|dvir|us> misterm: You're awesome.
[09:18:27] <kborchers> Elephant: What u prob want to do is use animate and animate the opacity down to 0.1 so that it isn't totally gone, then it should keep holding it's place until you get your data then fade back in
[09:18:40] <Elephant> k, I considered this.
[09:18:43] <Elephant> I'll give it a go.
[09:21:02] <rbd> hey guys... I'm including jquery and for some reason I can use $.whatever or $('#whatever') but not jQuery.whatever/jQuery('#whatever')  ...any ideas why this may be?
[09:21:27] <rbd> I have some script sthat use jQuery( instead of $( and I'm getting errors
[09:21:43] <rbd> this is jquery 1.6.1
[09:22:17] <misterm> rbd: is something calling .noConflict()?
[09:22:37] <rbd> misterm: I'll check
[09:23:01] <`andy> wondering how i extend the "controlBox" function in this script -- https://github.com/botskonet/jquery.formbuilder/blob/master/js/jquery.formbuilder.js
[09:23:02] <misterm> rbd: someone might do something like $ = jQuery.noConflict(), not that it would make much sense
[09:24:02] <rbd> misterm: normally though I can use $( and jQuery(, right? or do I explicitly have to do something like "var jQuery = $;"
[09:24:16] <newuser> hey guys .. i was just wondering if anybody could maybe help me with accordion in jquery?
[09:24:33] <misterm> rbd: normally you can use both...it could be a scoping isue, or an over-writing issue or lots of things
[09:24:49] <Elephant> kborchers: awesome! Actually fadeTo using an opacity of 0 does exactly what I want
[09:25:35] <noobie25> i have a about 3 forms on the page ... but when i hit 'enter key' it submits the form.   I'd rather it call a function i have before it submits.... how can i go about doing this?
[09:26:40] <misterm> noobie25: http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:27:09] <noobie25> misterm,   thank you for pointing me in the right direction sir ;)
[09:27:31] <kborchers> Elephant: Cool
[09:27:34] <newuser> i am trying to place .button()'s inside of .accordion() but, its like i click second button it scrolls up and first it becomes ok again .. what do i do to fix it?
[09:28:58] <misterm> noobie25: no prob
[09:32:55] <rbd> misterm: yeah it looks like something messed with "jQuery": http://pastebin.com/afGUx5R8 ....trying to find out the source of that...
[09:37:37] <rbd> yup found it...the Django debug toolbar...
[09:39:42] <rosco_y> How can this jsFiddle example work, without a reference to the jsTree jQuery plugin?  Can someone please explain: http://jsfiddle.net/raylitalo/TUva2/

[10:08:30] <|RicharD|> anybody use fancybox or colorbox ?
[10:12:14] <sean-dev> A bit of colorbox
[10:12:29] <sean-dev> basics for popups.
[10:12:49] <Dravekx> After adding a bunch of text, how can I get the height of the container to adjust with the browser? anyone have a clue?
[10:12:58] <Dravekx> http://dravekx.dyndns.org/testsite/
[10:14:38] <Dravekx> hmmm
[10:14:51] <Dravekx> guess I could use overflow:hidden in the css and be done with it.
[10:14:53] <sean-dev> Do you have an example?
[10:15:09] <sean-dev> I would think css with % signs
[10:15:44] <sean-dev> Like what your trying to do. Not like a tut or anything.
[10:16:34] <Dravekx> sean-dev if you click the add button and adjust the browser size, the container height doesnt adjust with the text.
[10:17:06] <|RicharD|> How i can use colorbox/fancybox for create a modal dialog of steps ?
[10:17:07] <Dravekx> I guess I need fluid height on the content container.. somehow.
[10:17:58] <sean-dev> Give me a sec, I am going to look at the source to see what your doing, but if can adjust it with css. you might want to do a bit of calculation before it though
[10:18:26] <Dravekx> sean-dev thanks :)
[10:18:41] <Dravekx> sean-dev ill try to setup a fiddle
[10:19:02] <sean-dev> I got it up with the right click haha
[10:19:10] <Dravekx> :D
[10:20:37] <fotoflo> hmm, quick question:  var favicon = new Image(); favicon.src = url;  How do i actually get favicon and store it in localStorage?
[10:22:07] <sean-dev> Dravekx I will be right back
[10:22:31] <Kambfhase> draw the image into a canvas 2D context, get back the canvas display as base64 and store that.
[10:23:07] <fotoflo> kambfhase sounds really complicated
[10:23:28] <Kambfhase> yeah, there might be smarter ways to do it.
[10:24:59] <fireh> Er, Dravekx, you have a fixed height on div.content (inline style)
[10:26:24] <Dravekx> http://jsfiddle.net/eDLfH/5/
[10:26:26] <Dravekx> there we go
[10:26:31] <Dravekx> that should make it easier
[10:26:51] <Dravekx> fireh that is made by the js
[10:27:16] <sean-dev> haha thanks
[10:27:36] <sean-dev> it looks like css positioning
[10:27:38] <Dravekx> kinda messy, but I kinda suck with js
[10:28:35] <fotoflo> Kambfhase: Oh i think i found an answer: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDUQFjAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fdeveloperworks%2Fmydeveloperworks%2Fblogs%2Fbobleah%2Fentry%2Fhtml5_code_example_store_images_using_localstorage57&rct=j&q=storing%20an%20image%20with%20javascript&ei=me5PTszJC-nrmAXspNDKBg&usg=AFQjCNEWhx13ea89_bzSxA54RGUi4bHQ6w&sig2=tWux3_BRGetAsde8VTTl2g&cad=rjt
[10:28:47] <fotoflo> sorry, nasty url
[10:28:52] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:28:59] <Dravekx> sean-dev I think I might need to stick with overflow:hidden, but I was hoping some kind of adjustment would work with fluid height.
[10:29:02] <sean-dev> I am still trying to get comfortable with it.
[10:29:15] <Kambfhase> yeah, looks like what you need
[10:29:24] <sean-dev> did you try overflow: auto
[10:29:31] <Dravekx> no. let me try that.
[10:30:10] <Dravekx> lol. overflow auto causes a scroll bar.
[10:30:20] <sean-dev> nevermind haha
[10:30:34] <sean-dev> I was thinking of something else.
[10:31:01] <sean-dev> basically you want it to let the browser get smaller without adjusting everything else right?
[10:31:11] <sean-dev> without it scaling down?
[10:32:00] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I know two elements are siblings. Can I get which one comes first?
[10:32:29] <Dravekx> sean-dev I want the information in the content container to do what it's doing, but stay inside the container and push the footer down. make the height of the container adjust with the browser.
[10:32:29] <min|dvir|us> Is there a general ordering mechanism in the DOM?
[10:32:50] <Dravekx> kinda complicated lol
[10:33:26] <Dravekx> not sure it can be done
[10:33:34] <Kambfhase> ?index @ min|dvir|us
[10:33:55] <sean-dev> oh okay that makes sense to me now
[10:34:12] <Kambfhase> bot-t Y U NO R HERE?
[10:34:21] <Kambfhase> .tell bot-t Y U NO R HERE?
[10:34:32] <Kambfhase> .seen  bot-t
[10:34:36] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 1 day, 14 hours and 30 minutes ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 258 seconds
[10:34:37] <sean-dev> you can do an innerHtml thing
[10:34:50] <sean-dev> or you can design the structure of the page a bit different.
[10:34:52] <juha_> hello peeps
[10:35:23] <Kambfhase> min|dvir|us: .index() gives use the index of the current element within its siblings.
[10:35:24] <Dravekx> sean-dev ahhhh... I didnt think about trying that.
[10:35:25] <kborchers> min|dvir|us: If you check .index() of each element, the index is based on the parent so the lower number is first
[10:35:52] <sean-dev> I did it on js fiddle
[10:35:53] <min|dvir|us> kborchers, Kambfhase: Thanks.
[10:35:55] <Kambfhase> or you can element.prev( otherelement) (maybe)
[10:36:09] <sean-dev> wrap the links in the a div
[10:36:21] <Dravekx> can you link me?
[10:36:33] <sean-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/eDLfH/5/
[10:36:45] <sean-dev> I did it on the one you opened I am not sure if it shows
[10:37:19] <Dravekx> no. oen sec. let me screenshot
[10:38:27] <sean-dev> I will create a new one hold a sec
[10:38:30] <Dravekx> see? it's outside the container: http://i.imgur.com/u6xh7.png
[10:38:40] <sean-dev> Yeah I got it to work
[10:38:44] <Dravekx> sweet
[10:38:57] <sean-dev> I just don't if it is visible on the jsfiddle for you
[10:39:09] <sean-dev> It was a div take
[10:39:10] <sean-dev> tag
[10:39:13] <|RicharD|> why with
[10:39:15] <|RicharD|> $('#ajax-error-message').html(data.error);
[10:39:25] <sean-dev> I grouped them together
[10:39:26] <|RicharD|> in firebug it show me all html page tag ecc... ?
[10:39:39] <|RicharD|> in php i do: 				echo json_encode(array("error"=>"Login Sbagliato. Perfavore reinserisci username/password"));
[10:39:50] <|RicharD|> I want do a simple login with error
[10:40:14] <Dravekx> sean-dev update and send me the link?
[10:40:33] <sean-dev> let me create a new one then will do
[10:40:44] <Dravekx> awesome
[10:40:48] <Kambfhase> |RicharD|: do you use .getJSON?
[10:41:00] <|RicharD|> umh where i mus use it ?
[10:41:02] <|RicharD|> anyway no
[10:41:05] <|RicharD|> i see the docs of jquery
[10:41:36] <sean-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/eDLfH/7/
[10:41:39] <sean-dev> there you go
[10:42:01] <sean-dev> It has to do with the position of div tags by default
[10:42:16] <|RicharD|> ehm also
[10:42:32] <|RicharD|> if i do alert(data.error) it return me all html tag ecc...
[10:43:25] <|RicharD|> maybe because i do it into a fancybox ?
[10:43:28] <misterm> |RicharD|: just fyi, save yourself a lot of trouble and learn to use console.log()
[10:43:45] <sean-dev> I forgot what they are, I think it is relative. The problem was that you didn't div tags for your links there actually belong to no div so when you added it it was adding it on top of the page, instead of inside the container
[10:44:16] <sean-dev> If that doesn't make sense let me know, I will try to make a better one haha
[10:44:54] <Dravekx> ahh.. that's a little better. the content still extends outside the container with the browser size though.
[10:46:22] <Dravekx> hmmm there should be a way to say equal fluid height.
[10:46:48] <noobie25> i'm trying to submit a form by pressing 'enter'.   Currently, i have a div id "button" when it is clicked, correctly makes an ajax call.   I'd like it to call this same button when I hit the "enter" key and i currently implemented using a .submit(), but the screen refreshes the entire page ... any solutions?
[10:47:41] <sean-dev> okay let me see
[10:48:34] <Dravekx> the current functions set the columns equal height, but it's static. I was trying to get them fluid height.
[10:48:54] <^Mike> So, I have the following little script to do accordion folding on my website. Is there an easy way to scroll smoothly to the clicked heading while also unfolding it? http://sprunge.us/aERZ?js
[10:49:06] <Kambfhase> noobie25: return false!
[10:49:11] <sean-dev> thats an overload of css
[10:49:22] <sean-dev> if you want to deal with the height.
[10:49:48] <noobie25> Kambfhase,  thanks...that worked.
[10:49:52] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:49:57] <Dravekx> sean-dev i have a lot fo sections with a lot of content for the layout. :S
[10:50:00] <Dravekx> of*
[10:50:04] <sean-dev> Did you upload it to your test site
[10:50:22] <Dravekx> not yet. one sec.
[10:50:49] <sean-dev> kk
[10:51:16] <|RicharD|> why
[10:51:19] <|RicharD|> if i do: $('#PlayerLoginLoginForm').bind('submit', function() {
[10:51:38] <|RicharD|> it not do the javascript action but go to the form action
[10:51:40] <|RicharD|> ?
[10:52:02] <noobie25> Kambfhase,   i have duplicated code right now... 1) myform.submit(function {mycode})   2) submitbutton.click(function() {mycode}).  i'm unsure how to go about fixing this ...
[10:52:49] <sean-dev> Dravekx you want it to get smaller the more you add?
[10:52:59] <Kambfhase> var foo = function() {mycode}; myform.submit(foo); button.click(foo);
[10:53:00] <sean-dev> sorry I am just have a problem with that last part.
[10:53:28] <Kambfhase> functions can be passed around like values in JS
[10:55:03] <grid_> hey
[10:55:08] <Dravekx> sean-dev http://dravekx.dyndns.org/testsite/
[10:55:09] <noobie25> Kambfhase,   would this work if i define foo inside another function?  or should i place it in some global area?
[10:55:55] <sean-dev> i see what your saying now, I couldn't see it in fiddle
[10:56:02] <Dravekx> sean-dev see the content container? all the text. adjust your browser and it overflows outside the container. i want the height of all 3 containers to adjust fluidly with the content.
[10:56:20] <Kambfhase> i'd consider defining inside another function `better` but not sure if that works for you code. try it and see.
[10:56:40] <Dravekx> sean-dev not quite sure how to do it lol
[10:57:24] <sean-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/eDLfH/8/
[10:57:26] <sean-dev> does that do it?
[10:57:37] <sean-dev> it was position relative
[10:58:30] <Dravekx> sean-dev nope. still doesnt. Add the text in fiddle and move the center slider back and forth. The content will overflow the container.
[11:02:26] <sean-dev> dang I am trying haha
[11:02:32] <Dravekx> tuff
[11:02:44] <Dravekx> I tried a few times... cant figure it out. lol
[11:03:28] <grid_> i work with jquery dialog with containment to drag the dialog inside a fixed area, now i have also a script that will read the height and width of the page dynamically, i want to integrate the height and width of this with the jquery dialog fixed area, it should only drag there, can somebody help? http://jsfiddle.net/XZv2L/ it should update on browser resize
[11:03:59] <sean-dev> so the blue box should not get wider right?
[11:05:37] <Dravekx> sean-dev yeah. the bluebox needs to be liquid width and height.
[11:06:10] <sean-dev> I see what your saying
[11:06:58] <vilmoss> how can i set a custom tooltip with jquery tools? if i use the tip property with a div as the tooltip, the positioning is messed up. If I use it in the default way, it works fine. Is there a known bug for this, or am I just doing it wrong?
[11:09:20] <Dravekx> sean-dev possible? what do you think?
[11:11:44] <sean-dev> I think it is
[11:11:55] <sean-dev> I think it is a simple css thing
[11:12:17] <sean-dev> but if it isn't you would have to calculate both the width and the height of the container.
[11:12:40] <sean-dev> and redraw each time its moved, so I think there has to be a css thing to it
[11:12:58] <sean-dev> it may be caused by the outer container
[11:13:20] <Dravekx> maybe if I add height:100%;
[11:13:33] <sean-dev> yeah that would help
[11:13:56] <sean-dev> I believe it would
[11:17:15] <sean-dev> I got it
[11:17:20] <sean-dev> it was the javascript
[11:17:38] <sean-dev> the height function
[11:18:06] <sean-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/eDLfH/9/
[11:18:21] <Dravekx> AHHHH
[11:18:39] <sean-dev> I just realized you don't actually need to do it that way.
[11:18:47] <sean-dev> You could just do an appened
[11:19:49] <Dravekx> hmmm...
[11:19:54] <sean-dev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1501181/jquery-append-and-remove-element
[11:20:01] <sean-dev> thats another example
[11:20:32] <sean-dev> This is a start so you can optimize it anyway you like
[11:20:43] <sean-dev> i hope it helped, the offset I think is what caused it to
[11:20:47] <sean-dev> overflow
[11:20:51] <Dravekx> definitely helped.
[11:23:41] <Dravekx> sean-dev sweet thank man.
[11:23:46] <Dravekx> thanks*
[11:25:05] <sean-dev> np good luck with what your doing
[11:26:20] <WarDekar> hey so i have a scrollable div horizontally, and i want to make it so it scrolls whenever left/right are pressed when anywhere in the window has focus not just the div
[11:26:42] <WarDekar> so i put a binding on .keydown and override the default behavior, but i'm having trouble getting the div to scroll
[11:41:34] <elidupuis> can anyone help me out with some cross domain ajax stuff? i run into this issue every time and i don't what i'm doing wrong.
[11:42:40] <sean`> elidupuis, ?
[11:43:05] <elidupuis> just trying to load oembed data from youtube: http://elidupuis.com/ajaxtest/
[11:44:41] <elidupuis> i've tried different settings (json/jsonp/callback=? etc.) and the success callback never gets called
[11:49:14] <misterm> elidupuis: ajax requests can't work cross-domain on their own, you have to use something like  jsonp, a serverside proxy, cors, etc
[11:54:42] <elidupuis> misterm: if i switch to datatype=jsonp, an invalid label error. the json validates fine.
[11:58:07] <misterm> elidupuis: is it sending JSON or JSONP?
[11:58:29] <misterm> elidupuis: JSONP is JSON with Padding, you have to do the whole padding thing for it to work
[11:59:27] <misterm> elidupuis: in other words, if the server is replying with valid JSON, that's not valid JSONP
[12:00:28] <elidupuis> misterm: i don't have control over the response from the server—it's youtube. does that mean i can't get the data with jquery?
[12:01:08] <int_64> hi
[12:01:24] <misterm> elidupuis: to do cros domain ajax requests, you need some sort of cooperation with the server
[12:01:26] <int_64> I have a question about the jquery.cycle plugin.
[12:01:35] <int_64> Is there a way to programmtically pick a slide?
[12:01:40] <int_64> and just have it stop there?
[12:01:40] <misterm> elidupuis: I'm not familiar with the youtube API, so I don't know if it provides it
[12:01:50] <misterm> elidupuis: if it doesn't, you'll have to use some sort of proxy
[12:02:10] <elidupuis> misterm: k. thanks for your help.
[12:02:18] <int_64> hi misterm
[12:02:37] <int_64> nevermind
[12:02:41] <int_64> I found it in the docs L:)
[12:02:42] <int_64> :)
[12:03:01] <natrixnatrix89> what's the difference between keydown and keypress?
[12:04:06] <misterm> natrixnatrix89: one binds to the keydown event, and the other to keypress
[12:04:27] <misterm> natrixnatrix89: http://api.jquery.com/keydown/   , http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[12:04:40] <natrixnatrix89> well. that's what I was reading..
[12:04:50] <natrixnatrix89> but what's the difference between these events?
[12:05:11] <misterm> natrixnatrix89: it's covered pretty explicitly in the docs
[12:05:25] <misterm> natrixnatrix89: check the docs for keypress
[12:05:29] <natrixnatrix89> ok.
[12:07:21] <discountrobot> does anybody sit in with a pretty form template/layout?
[12:09:06] <elidupuis> misterm: turns out youtube doesn't support jsonp... fyi
[12:10:06] <misterm> elidupuis: ok, yea you'll have to either proxy it yourself, or there might be some service that will do it for you
[12:10:34] <bbrandon> is there a selector trick to get this equivalent $(this "input:first").show(); ?
[12:11:15] <discountrobot> $(this).find('input:first').show();
[12:11:27] <bbrandon> discountrobot: thanks!
[12:15:24] <natrixnatrix89> hmm. but none of keypress events work for print screen button.. Is there a way to capture that too?
[12:19:13] <discountrobot> @natrix are you using charcode 44
[12:19:53] <imsky> natrixnatrix89: http://jsfiddle.net/p7PgZ/
[12:19:54] <imsky> it's 44
[12:20:06] <natrixnatrix89> I'm not using anything. just trying to log keypresses. and all keys log, but printscreen doesn't add anything
[12:20:17] <imsky> natrixnatrix89: see above
[12:20:21] <natrixnatrix89> ok
[12:21:25] <natrixnatrix89> it similar to what I had http://jsfiddle.net/Xdewd/3/
[12:21:42] <natrixnatrix89> and yeah. when I press print screen nothing happens
[12:21:52] <imsky> ?
[12:21:56] <imsky> you don't get an alert that says 44?
[12:22:19] <natrixnatrix89> nope
[12:22:33] <natrixnatrix89> but I get on other buttons
[12:22:44] <imsky> natrixnatrix89: http://jsfiddle.net/p7PgZ/1/
[12:22:49] <imsky> how about now
[12:23:29] <aca20031> if I use .getJson('foo.php', data); --> how does my php code in foo.php access 'data'?
[12:23:34] <natrixnatrix89> nothing
[12:23:40] <imsky> natrixnatrix89: what browser
[12:23:43] <natrixnatrix89> I get 32 when I hit space
[12:23:51] <natrixnatrix89> but printscreen does nothing
[12:23:53] <imsky> aca20031: through the $_GET[] superglobal
[12:23:58] <natrixnatrix89> I'm using chromium
[12:24:03] <aca20031> is it $_GET['data']?
[12:24:29] <imsky> natrixnatrix89: i'm on chromium 15, and i get 44
[12:24:32] <imsky> what os are you on?
[12:24:41] <imsky> aca20031: no, that depends on what you included in the js variable data
[12:24:55] <natrixnatrix89> 12.0.742.112 (90304) Ubuntu 11.04
[12:25:01] <aca20031> i see
[12:25:14] <imsky> hmm natrixnatrix89 i'm not familiar with linux quirks for keys
[12:25:23] <imsky> on windows this works cross-browser, firefox, ie, and chrome
[12:25:37] <natrixnatrix89> ok. so basically this should work only on windows..
[12:25:42] <imsky> heh perhaps
[12:25:57] <natrixnatrix89> I was just thinking if this can help to protect images on a page..
[12:26:03] <imsky> no
[12:26:06] <imsky> it can't
[12:26:09] <natrixnatrix89> right.. :/
[12:26:35] <discountrobot> why would you protect pictures anyway
[12:26:48] <Elephant> natrixnatrix89: if you transmit an image to a client's browser, they can capture it.
[12:26:55] <Elephant> it's a bit pointless to try and protect images.
[12:26:58] <natrixnatrix89> of course..
[12:28:56] <natrixnatrix89> so basically the only way to protect them would be using an ugly watermark all over the image.. :/
[12:33:11] <Techdeck> hey guys, what is the best (and most supported) way of overriding css properties (specified in a .css file) from jQuery?
[12:33:41] <Elephant> $('element').css('property')?
[12:34:40] <JKarsrud> ?css @ Techdeck
[12:34:40] <bot-t> Techdeck, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:35:35] <Techdeck> not for a specific element
[12:35:40] <Techdeck> by to override it completely
[12:35:55] <Techdeck> like if I have a css propery in my.css file saying:   a { color: red; } --
[12:36:01] <Techdeck> how do I change that in javascript?
[12:36:48] <Techdeck> one way I can think of is to inject it into the document into a <style> element and use !important, but that seems bad
[12:37:21] <JKarsrud> $('a').css('color', 'red')?
[12:37:27] <Techdeck> no..
[12:37:32] <Techdeck> a certain 'a' does not exist yet
[12:37:38] <Techdeck> will be injected later on..
[12:37:39] <JKarsrud> that would override it, you can't change it
[12:37:59] <Techdeck> I just gave an example of how I can override it.. but there must be a better way
[12:38:46] * Techdeck pokes ajpiano again
[12:38:59] <Techdeck> he usually saves me :P
[12:39:28] <JKarsrud> I really don't see the problem with setting the styles on the elements themselves with JS, instead of making a new style element and pushing the CSS into there
[12:39:58] <Techdeck> because you don't know my application, but it's all ajax and pretty much everything is injected
[12:39:59] <JKarsrud> Write a function that you can call when you insert the element that sets the elements CSS..
[12:40:03] <Techdeck> I need a way to control it from the base
[12:40:19] <Techdeck> it's not just for one element, I'm gonna need it for TONS of elements
[12:40:29] <Techdeck> it's gonna be a living hell if I'll do it per element
[12:40:58] <alaing> Techdeck: what you trying to do?
[12:41:22] <JKarsrud> sounds like you're overcomplicating things, imo. Can't you just import a stylesheet that overrides the styles?
[12:41:31] <Techdeck> hmm
[12:41:34] <Techdeck> now that's a good idea
[12:41:50] <Techdeck> JKarsrud, how will it override the changes?
[12:41:57] <Techdeck> do I need to add it by the end of the doc?
[12:42:11] <alaing> while you could just .addClass the class that need to be overridden
[12:42:19] <Techdeck> alaing, same issue as .css()
[12:42:25] <Techdeck> I don't want to do it per element
[12:42:31] <JKarsrud> not necessarily
[12:42:46] <Techdeck> JKarsrud, so how will it know to use the latter css file and not the first one?
[12:43:05] <JKarsrud> the last one imported will override
[12:43:06] <alaing> Techdeck: depends on the order the css files are loaded in
[12:43:11] <Techdeck> got it
[12:43:40] <Techdeck> is there a nice way of loading a .css file other than simply injecting a <link rel..>?
[12:44:03] <JKarsrud> addClass is pretty good too, just set it to a parent element, and use that class in your stylesheets as a hook
[12:44:21] <JKarsrud> .className a {color: blue; } would override a { color: red; }
[12:44:37] <JKarsrud> because of a higher selector score
[12:44:49] <Techdeck> I prefer not, that will mean I have to go over about 9000 lines of css
[12:45:26] <Techdeck> injecting a css file is a great idea, what is the best way to do it?
[12:45:58] <Techdeck> simply .append("<link...")?
[12:46:12] <JKarsrud> try it?
[12:46:16] <Techdeck> got it
[12:46:19] <Techdeck> thank you very much JKarsrud
[12:46:27] <Techdeck> JKarsrud++
[12:46:58] <JKarsrud> dunno if the browser will actually download and read the CSS file tho, so you'd have to test it, but it should work I guess
[12:47:02] <Techdeck> this will really save a lot of time
[12:49:55] <tehOPEologist> hey all
[12:50:09] <tehOPEologist> does anyone know if there's a MovableType IRC channel for support?
[12:50:31] <tehOPEologist> i'm looking to move a movabletype installation from one server to another, and i've never messed with movabletype before =/
[12:50:53] <Techdeck> ok it works.. now let's pray it works in IE too :)
[12:51:25] <Techdeck> yay! it does! thanks again
[12:51:29] <JKarsrud> =)
[12:51:31] <JKarsrud> np
[12:55:51] <tehOPEologist> does anyone have any movabletype experience?
[12:56:02] <tehOPEologist> i can't find their irc channel, and i figured someone in here might be able to help me out..

[13:16:54] <chisler> need some help creating a selector that will choose all anchor tags that have a href con taining specific text (case sensitive)
[13:28:32] <TeddyMurray> hey, how do you make something slide up dissolve?
[13:28:43] <TeddyMurray> ive seen it before, but
[13:28:48] <TeddyMurray> can't seem to find the right method
[13:30:14] <chisler> TeddyMurray: http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[13:30:39] <TeddyMurray> i saw that, but i want a more "wiping" effect
[13:30:48] <TeddyMurray> like its being wiped off the page
[13:38:00] <TeddyMurray> chisler, found what i need in the jqueryui :D
[13:38:19] <chisler> ah great.
[13:45:38] <mantasm> if I I select DOM element and print it in firebug, it lists "focus" in classes list, it displays it with appropriate css as well. However, el.is('.focus') returns false. el.hasClass('focus') returns false as well
[13:45:44] <mantasm> any idea what might be wrong?
[13:48:15] <akp> hello room any one in here for some help
[13:48:35] <akp> need some help with ajax sutff
[13:49:37] <mantasm> sure
[13:50:23] <akp> so i'm loading data via my ajax call, but on my success handler I'm wanting to capture the data that is sent back to me and load it into a new page
[13:50:42] <akp> I'm getting the data though before my new page reloads
[13:51:04] <akp> so when i do window.location = new page, I'm loosing all my data because of the page refresh
[13:51:19] <akp> what am i missing to hand off the data from one page to another
[13:51:35] <akp> <=== Really appreciates help
[13:52:35] <akp> basically this is my object http://pastie.org/2403321
[13:52:55] <akp> that makes the call on the 1st page
[13:54:22] <akp> <mantasm> any ideas or tuts where i'm missing basic knowledge on the subject?
[13:54:51] <akp> I feel like this is some fundemental thing with the window and the http request that i don't see
[13:55:51] <mantasm> why do you want to post smith to the page AND set it to window.location?
[13:56:31] <mantasm> if you want to user to navigate to some url, just do window.location.href = url and you're done
[13:56:41] <akp> ah that is coming from my form submission on the first page
[13:56:46] <mantasm> or am I missing smith why you do second ajax request on line 18th?
[13:57:00] <mantasm> *smth
[13:57:13] <akp> what is smth
[13:57:27] <akp> not familiar with abbreviation...
[13:57:35] <mantasm> something
[13:57:55] <akp> basic flow is four unique pages
[13:58:11] <akp> index, details, checkout, summary
[13:58:31] <akp> index has a form that I'm doing the first call on #4
[13:59:05] <mantasm> so you want to make an ajax request and then display itemDetails.html to the user, correct?
[13:59:32] <akp> I sitt on that first page, load the form data and wait for the response and the data returned. Then I want to load the second page with the data returned for the response from the POST
[13:59:37] <akp> yes
[14:00:16] <mantasm> do you want to display html fetched via ajax or fully reload the page?
[14:00:44] <mantasm> if you want to display fetched html, you should insert it into the page $('#content').html(data)
[14:01:09] <mantasm> if you want to display whole itemDetails.html to user, you can set window.location straight away, without making ajax request :)
[14:01:25] <mantasm> ajax request fetches some data without reloading the page
[14:01:40] <mantasm> window.location drops whatever you have in your current page and loads new fresh page
[14:03:04] <ravenzz> it make no sense..to get post data by ajax and than load another page with those data
[14:04:34] <akp> will the data from the form still be in memory so i can post it to the server and get the data response if i set window.location straight away? <mantasm>
[14:05:26] <mantasm> akp: No. If you want to keep the current page, you have to update current page instead of doing window.loocation thing
[14:05:26] <akp> I need to send that data from the form, change the page, then load the response from the server
[14:05:45] <akp> ah how do i update current page
[14:05:46] <akp> ??
[14:05:58] <mantasm> $('element_id').html(stuff) :)
[14:06:38] <mantasm> to do that, you need a single ajax request only, since change the page and load response from the server are pretty much the same
[14:06:42] <akp> so html.html(stuff)
[14:06:44] <akp> ??
[14:07:16] <mantasm> $.post('/some/url', form_data).success(function(data){ $('#content_container').html(data) }) and you're set
[14:07:29] <mantasm> html_element_selected_with_jquery.html(stuff)
[14:08:18] <akp> i need to load an individual page (itemDetals.html) then load data into an object in itemDetails.html
[14:08:35] <akp> totally seprate pages though
[14:08:44] <akp> index, details, checkout, summary
[14:08:49] <akp> the flow of the pages
[14:08:56] <mantasm> so generate the damn itemDetails on the server and load it
[14:09:23] <mantasm> without fancy html5 stuff, you can't change url AND keep existing data in memory
[14:09:36] <mantasm> although you can stay on a single page and just update it accordingly
[14:09:38] <akp> that's lame
[14:09:47] <mantasm> what's lame?
[14:10:33] <akp> what about put the serialize for data through the url to the next page, then running a post of that data on itemDetails.html page
[14:10:35] <ravenzz> akp form > submit > fetch data > output
[14:10:39] <ravenzz> and you are done
[14:11:02] <ravenzz> it make no sense to get the data by ajax and send it to a 3rd page
[14:11:06] <mantasm> akp: why the hell do you want to do that? it's lame :)
[14:11:16] <akp> tell me about it
[14:12:24] <mantasm> you know there're are all though server-side languages and frameworks that makes generating itemDetails.html on the server uber-easy
[14:12:40] <mantasm> on the other hand, you can fetch some data via ajax and then put it into the current page
[14:13:09] <mantasm> there's no single reason to mix those two approaches
[14:13:23] <akp> i'm lost a bit
[14:13:38] <ravenzz> akp what are you trying to do?
[14:13:45] <akp> i understand using single page app and just pushing data around...
[14:13:59] <ravenzz> tell us about the specifications of your "project"
[14:14:14] <akp> <ravenzz> I have serverices that i'm pulling data from.
[14:14:17] <mantasm> akp: if you want to do single page app, why the hell do you want that damn itemDetails.html?
[14:14:34] <akp> i don't/can't
[14:14:39] <mantasm> just "push data around" and insert it into the page
[14:14:41] <akp> not yet...it's a long story
[14:14:56] <mantasm> well, since we don't know that story, we can't help you much
[14:15:05] <mantasm> just forward user to server-generated page
[14:15:05] <akp> so right now the approach is just 4 pages
[14:15:23] <mantasm> OR get data and put it into currently loaded page
[14:15:53] <mantasm> 4 pages doesn't mean it has to load 4 unique pages in the browser
[14:16:03] <mantasm> or make 4 pages server side
[14:17:34] <akp> <mantasm> so i basically can't push the form data from index.htm to the server, then load itemDetails.html, then load the data from the first request into the itemDetails.html page?
[14:19:08] <mantasm> No
[14:19:36] <mantasm> we already told you several times how to achieve this
[14:20:09] <mantasm> but it's not possible in your mixed ajax/full page loading  way
[14:21:46] <akp> because ajax is intended for asynchronous loading, one the widow object is reloaded the browser forgets what was just happening?
[14:21:53] <akp> *once
[14:22:07] <akp> <===still learning mind you....
[14:22:21] <mantasm> when you reload a page (via window.location) all states and data from previous page is lost
[14:23:21] <mantasm> and there's no reason to do what you're trying to do, unless you have a VERY weird system in place
[14:23:31] <mantasm> stop banging your head into the wall
[14:23:36] <akp> no shit...
[14:23:44] <mantasm> and do this in one of the proper ways :)
[14:24:06] <mantasm> I'm yet to see the weird system that would require something like what you try to do
[14:24:17] <mantasm> I'd be more than interested to see it
[14:24:17] <akp> so i have to basically get my java guys to load itemdetails in it
[14:24:40] <akp> i mean in a successful response
[14:24:54] <mantasm> so you can get item details via ajax and insert it into the current page without reloading
[14:25:10] <akp> just wasn't clear that i need the backend involved once i start pushing data to it, and then need a new page...
[14:25:26] <mantasm> do you need a new page for the user
[14:25:34] <mantasm> or technically whole new page
[14:25:35] <mantasm> ?
[14:25:47] <akp> yes
[14:26:01] <mantasm> which one? :)
[14:26:19] <akp> a new page
[14:26:43] <mantasm> technically or for the user?
[14:27:02] <akp> basically those 4 pages i mentioned earlier...this is for a mobile site. The proper way is to do the single page application with html5 and control the view state with js, but there wasn't enough time for that
[14:27:55] <akp> so we decided to just load 4 individual pages....now i see that once we start to pass data to the services layer to get more data we are going to need the server to then initiate the page load with the new data
[14:28:10] <mantasm> so why don't you just redirect user to item details page, which would be generated on the server side?
[14:28:43] <akp> i don't have any of that set up, and the back end is in java and using ftl language for page construction in spring
[14:29:18] <mantasm> ah, enterpri$e...
[14:29:21] <mantasm> anyway
[14:29:33] <jimi_hendrix> hi, i am trying to get the mouse's position relative to an element. i am doing this by recording the pageX and pageY variables captured from the mousemove event for that element, but the coords are off. instead of being the tip of the mouse, they are more towards about the middle of the mouse. why might this be?
[14:29:34] <mantasm> do you need url to be yourwebsite.com/itemdetails.html?
[14:29:35] <akp> what about passing the form data via get, loading itemDetails, then taking that string data in the url and do an ajax call and wait for the response...that would work wouldn't it?
[14:29:45] <akp> yeah....
[14:29:58] <mantasm> why?
[14:29:59] <akp> shhh don't tell anyone how ignorant i am....
[14:30:08] <akp> just to have something working...
[14:30:22] <mantasm> the easiest way to approach is
[14:30:23] <akp> i'm sick of waiting for the f--cking java dev's
[14:30:32] <akp> i know i know...server side logic
[14:30:34] <mantasm> get the content of damn item details.html
[14:30:42] <akp> and just update the page?
[14:30:47] <mantasm> yes
[14:30:53] <mantasm> it works the same for the end user
[14:31:03] <mantasm> pretty much the only difference is in url bar
[14:31:12] <akp> i can update the url as well... though
[14:31:24] <mantasm> no you can't :)
[14:32:05] <mantasm> well, it's possible to some nasty stuff to make it so-so happen
[14:32:14] <mantasm> but that's it, it's nasty nasty stuff
[14:32:27] <mantasm> as you mentioned before, you can serialize your data
[14:32:39] <akp> <jimi_hendrix> just set your var to those coordinates, then add an offset constant to change the coordinates base on the mouse width and height
[14:32:51] <mantasm> and then do window.location = 'itemDetails.html?serialized_data=blablabla'
[14:32:54] <akp> well the data is small
[14:33:06] <mantasm> and that doesn't require second ajax request
[14:33:09] <akp> like 4 - 5 pieces of info
[14:33:14] <jimi_hendrix> akp, alright
[14:33:15] <akp> right...
[14:33:36] <akp> <jimi_hendrix> does that make sense?
[14:34:32] <jimi_hendrix> aka-, yes
[14:34:53] <akp> ok...well I might go down that path just to get something going...really though the best way is to just call a function on the back end, and push the form data to the server...
[14:35:36] <akp> <mantasm> thanks for sussing that out...i still have the fundemental gaps in my knowledge with it come to the browser and the DOM...
[14:35:59] <Kambfhase> dont worry, the DOM is horrible and should never have be build
[14:36:15] <mantasm> akp: you're welcome
[14:36:18] <akp> how would we do anything then?
[14:37:02] <akp> i still amazed at how much i don't know just to be a solid developer, and then friends and family are like...OMG how do you do that stuff?
[14:37:15] <akp> frustrating
[14:40:36] <mantasm> for me it was 6 years gap between friends-and-family and developer-that-puts-food-on-a-table
[14:40:56] <mantasm> it's pretty easy to impress regular folks in most cases
[14:43:24] <mantasm> and despite how "solid" you're, programming is always frustrating. I'm trying to fix a single small bug for the last 48 hours, despite working full-time as web developer for 3+ years and having built a crapload of apps. Believe me, that's frustrating. I love my job though.
[14:46:05] <bricker> Is it prudent to use jquery to make a simple, infinitely looping image slideshow? This is just a header for my site, and it fades between images… currently we're using Flash, but I'd like to drop that if possible. I can show you what we have currently if you'd like to get an idea
[14:47:41] <mantasm> bricker: there're quite a few image slideshow plugins for jquery. Can't remember specific names though. Googling should help :)
[14:49:13] <bricker> mantasm: Yeah, I'm looking at them, I was mostly asking if it there was anything conceptually wrong with using javascript to do this. I'm not much of a front-end developer, don't deal with compatibility/client-side stuff often
[14:49:58] <mantasm> bricker: nope, that's ok to use javascript in such case
[14:50:12] <bricker> mantasm: thanks!
[14:50:39] <mantasm> bricker: you're welcome. Less flash on the web makes kittens happy!
[14:51:31] <aDatabase> this is likely slightly obvious, but after grabbing an HTML document with the span classes "object" and "place", how would I only append "place" to, say, #content?
[14:51:51] <bricker> mantasm: we have had this big flash header for years… I am partly concerned about compatibility/loading times, but my biggest problem with it is that every time the client wants a change in the header, I have to open Adobe Flash and figure it out
[14:51:59] <aDatabase> (grabbing it via AJAX, obviously)
[14:52:28] <bricker> mantasm: this will make changing the header as simple as changing a navigation link, for example
[14:52:32] <mantasm> aDatabase: do you want to extract "place? from the fetched html document and then append it to #content?
[14:52:37] <aDatabase> Yes.
[14:53:22] <mantasm> bricker: yep, javascript is much simpler to deal with. You should have no compatibility issues and loading should be faster, unless you have to support  10 year old browsers. I believe ie6 should be fine though :)
[14:54:06] <mantasm> aDatabase: $('.place', fetched_html) will extract .place from whole fetched document
[14:54:18] <aDatabase> ah, thank you!
[14:54:19] <bricker> mantasm: I think we block out ie6, or just render a text version of the page for them or something… I guess that's not best practice but this is 2011.
[14:54:40] <mantasm> bricker: haha, then JS is much more efficient for sure
[14:55:17] <bricker> It'd be like if game developers had to make new games compatible with 12 year old PC's.
[14:55:35] <bricker> sort of
[14:56:01] <aDatabase> hm.
[14:56:11] <aDatabase> mantasm: doing that is just printing "[object Object]", for some reason
[14:58:35] <mantasm> aDatabase: the code above returns query object. Then do $('#content').append(that_object)
[14:59:01] <aDatabase> I think I am.
[14:59:07] <aDatabase> Hang on, lemme cut down and pastebin
[15:01:24] <aDatabase> mantasm: http://pastebin.com/wQP5PNYd
[15:03:20] <mantasm> aDatabase: you can't put together object and string as you do at line #3. You should create <p> object and append text to it
[15:03:37] <aDatabase> Ah, okay.
[15:03:38] <mantasm> aDatabase: $('<p></p>').append(text).appendTo('#console');
[15:03:56] <aDatabase> thanks
[15:05:18] <wappy> hi?
[15:05:54] <wappy> hi guys can i ask a question here regarding jbooklet?
[15:06:05] <Corey> Don't ask to ask, just ask.
[15:06:09] <Cork[home]> ?ask
[15:06:10] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:08:21] <TrueColors> How would I create a new element inside $("body") and fade it in?
[15:09:16] <TrueColors> I was thinking.. $("body").append("<div class=\"myclass\" style=\"display: none;\"> ... </div>"); $(".myclass").fadeIn(400);
[15:09:20] <TrueColors> but there has to be ab etter solution?
[15:09:50] <TrueColors> thought of doing.. $("body").append("...").fadeIn(400); but not sure that would work for the new element.
[15:10:19] <wappy> ok  im using a jquery plugin booklet, http://builtbywill.com/code/booklet/examples/overlays. is there a way that i can add a gray gradient to the middle of the book? the content is images...
[15:10:35] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: store it an a variable, hide it, then append it
[15:11:09] <TrueColors> I'm not sure I understand Cork?
[15:11:20] <TrueColors> Store what in a variable... and how can you hide an inexistant element?
[15:11:31] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: var new_elm = $('<div/>'
[15:11:36] <Cork[home]> bah...
[15:12:07] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: var new_elm = $('<div/>'); $new_elm.hide(); $parent.append($new_elm); $new_elm.fadeIn(300);
[15:12:48] <TrueColors> do you mean.. new_elm. instead of $new_elm. ?
[15:13:05] <Cork[home]> heh ya
[15:13:24] <Cork[home]> or rather the oposit
[15:14:58] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/R8xgQ/ so like this? seems to work.
[15:15:50] <TrueColors> And I thought $("...") only did elements, classes and ids. along with selectors.. or whatever.
[15:16:10] <TrueColors> so how does it work - I mean, how does it hide an element that is not yet existant in the document?
[15:16:23] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: the element alreayd exist
[15:16:42] <TrueColors> I'm guessing it exists in the Dom, rather than the actual document? or what?
[15:16:52] <Cork[home]> all it does is set the css value to display:none, (and store the old value in a global variable)
[15:17:10] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: no it doens't exist in the dom, that IS the document
[15:17:38] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: what $('<elm/>') does is document.createElement('elm')
[15:18:03] <Cork[home]> tecnically the browser creates a new temporary dom with one element
[15:18:18] <TrueColors> hm
[15:18:21] <Cork[home]> that you later move the element from to the current dom
[15:18:43] <TrueColors> Oh right, I didn't know there is more than one Dom. (I don't know much about it)
[15:20:40] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: you can create as many doms as you like :)
[15:20:51] <Cork[home]> thats for example how you handle xml
[15:21:36] <TrueColors> so if I had var elm_1 = $('<elm/>'); var elm_2 = $('<elm/>'); does this create two doms with 1 element each, or 1 dom with 2 elements in it?
[15:22:08] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: it creates two, but thats tecnically
[15:22:34] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: what the language sees it as is "two disconnected elements"
[15:24:02] <TrueColors> I understand, nice. So is using too many Dom elements when it can be prevented... bad?
[15:24:26] <TrueColors> For example, you can create a table using divs which can contain less elements than a table element would.
[15:25:47] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: tables have rendering features other elements doesn't have
[15:26:05] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: but yes, talbes is one of the more costly elements to use
[15:26:25] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: another is position: fixed elements
[15:26:38] <TrueColors> Fixed... oh...
[15:26:51] <TrueColors> Oh wait.
[15:27:01] <Cork[home]> its costly cause the browser doesn't know whats below it
[15:27:19] <Cork[home]> so it has to do compositions each draw
[15:27:28] <Cork[home]> d2d helps there though
[15:27:34] <TrueColors> I've never used fixed positions, I've used Static though.
[15:27:34] <Cork[home]> so its less of a problem now days
[15:28:28] <TrueColors> but is it possible to append to the start of an element, like... right now my JS will append the FADE div, to the end of $("body") rather than the start ? It doesn't matter if it's not.
[15:28:40] <noobie25> how do i select another "class" element if i have it stored in a variable.   For example:    var e = $("#firstdiv")    but i want to get to secondinnerdiv .   I thought e.$("#secondinnerdiv") but no good
[15:28:54] <Cork[home]> ?.prepend @ TrueColors
[15:28:55] <bot-t> TrueColors, .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[15:29:05] <TrueColors> Ah, that would work!
[15:29:22] <Cork[home]> ?.find @ noobie25
[15:29:22] <bot-t> noobie25, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:29:56] <noobie25> Cork[home], thanks
[15:30:43] <Cork[home]> wappy: its posible, ya
[15:31:01] <TrueColors> Aww, I was about to answer him :P I thought either children() or find(), looked at the docs for children() and that wouldn't work so heh.
[15:31:08] <Cork[home]> wappy: but it might be simpler to just use images
[15:33:32] <juha_> ugh, how does regex selectors work? i'm trying to get td#C4 where C can be any letter and 4 is static..
[15:33:49] <juha_> all i'm getting is an empty array
[15:33:58] <juha_> object, not array
[15:34:05] <Kambfhase> regex selectors?
[15:34:14] <Cork[home]> juha_: jquery doesn't use regex
[15:34:21] <Cork[home]> its css selectors
[15:34:27] <Kambfhase> you can use .filter though
[15:34:37] <Cork[home]> not for text
[15:34:41] <Cork[home]> only elements
[15:34:50] <TrueColors> jQuery doesn't use regex? awww
[15:35:01] <Cork[home]> why would it?
[15:35:08] <Cork[home]> regex is for text searches
[15:35:15] <Cork[home]> javascript has that nativly
[15:35:24] <TrueColors> Well it makes a lot of things that standard JS has easier to use.
[15:35:30] <TrueColors> just thought it'd have regex handling too.
[15:35:40] <Cork[home]> but for what?
[15:35:46] <Cork[home]> you can't regex match an element
[15:36:06] <TrueColors> I meant for text.
[15:36:07] <TrueColors> if ( $("elm").html().regex("^[a-z]$") === false ) { ... }
[15:36:08] <TrueColors> or something lol
[15:36:14] <Cork[home]> that you can do
[15:36:19] <TrueColors> oh right
[15:36:21] <Cork[home]> but thats not jquery, just native js
[15:36:34] <TrueColors> is that coded right, though? I took a wild guess.
[15:36:38] <Cork[home]> nope
[15:36:39] <Kambfhase> that you can do, young padawan!
[15:36:46] <Cork[home]> ?mdc match
[15:36:47] <bot-t> Cork[home], match - MDN Docs - Used to retrieve the matches when matching a string against a regular expression . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[15:37:16] <Cork[home]> ?mdc search
[15:37:21] <bot-t> Cork[home], search - MDN Docs - Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and this String object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search
[15:37:25] <peol>  /^[a-z]+$/i.test( $('#elm').text() ) might work
[15:38:09] <TrueColors> so it would be something like.. $("elm").html().match ( /^[a-z]+$/ ) ... or .val, or .text or whatever the element was
[15:38:30] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: if you want true/false then its search
[15:38:46] <TrueColors> oh okay
[15:39:02] <Cork[home]> TrueColors: well basically heres the options https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
[15:39:07] <stupidnic> I was wondering if somebody could help me devise a solution for a menu that is "bouncing" from using "slideDown()slideUp()" when a user quickly mouses over the items: http://jsfiddle.net/HKupW/5/
[15:39:24] <Kambfhase> hoverIntent
[15:39:34] <TrueColors> I was goin to suggest .stop() ?
[15:40:11] <TrueColors> so that would prevent the previous action, so if the slide was still happening - it would stop it, and... do the next action.
[15:40:18] <TrueColors> $("elm").stop().slideUp(); or something
[15:40:29] <TrueColors> That's if I understood the question lol
[15:40:54] <TrueColors> well, that broke it anyway lol
[15:40:56] <stupidnic> hmmm. I was already familiar with hoverIntent
[15:41:12] <stupidnic> but wasn't exactly sure it was what I was looking for
[15:50:49] <TrueColors> Is it possible to do var new_elm = $("<div>My Fade</div>").hide(); or does it have ot be var new_elm = $("<div>My Fade</div>"); new_elm.hide(); ?
[15:56:07] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/kZDfT/ This is my message plugin, it's new but why is it displaying null, when it should be displaying the message in a success box? Also, what would you do to improve this, but don't go too complicated on me!
[16:08:08] <TrueColors> hm
[16:08:11] <TrueColors> thinking of passing an array
[16:08:29] <TrueColors> $.winmsg({messages: [error: "Please fill in all fields"]});
[16:08:30] <TrueColors> i thikn that's right
[16:08:39] <TrueColors> but how would I itterate through... it
[16:08:48] <TrueColors> for instance in php I could do.. foreach ( $messages as $key => $value )
[16:08:53] <TrueColors> because I need the key.
[16:10:29] <dabear> for(var key in anobject){   if(anobject.hasOwnProperty(key)){   var value = anobject[key]; /* do your thing with key and value*/ }     }
[16:11:21] <dabear> @TrueColors
[16:11:42] <TrueColors> ah, thanks.
[16:11:43] <gnarf> ?$.each
[16:11:44] <bot-t> gnarf, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[16:11:50] <gnarf> ?jQuery.each
[16:11:50] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[16:12:31] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.each({ key: "value" }, function ( key, value ) { console.log( "Key is:", key, "Value is:", value ); });
[16:12:32] <bot-t> gnarf: "Key is:" "key" "Value is:" "value"{"key": "value"}
[16:12:34] <eazyigz> Is it possible to execute a callback at the end of $.each completion?
[16:13:17] <dabear> ?js print("foo")
[16:13:18] <bot-t> dabear: "foo"
[16:13:51] <TrueColors> Um, can you do a .each on a variable or not?
[16:14:05] <dabear> ?js  $.when (jQuery.each({ key: "value" }, function ( key, value ) { console.log( "Key is:", key, "Value is:", value ); }) , function(){ print("ended")})
[16:14:05] <bot-t> dabear: TypeError: $.when is not a function
[16:14:26] <dabear> bot-t: your jquery is old yeah
[16:14:27] <bot-t> dabear, Stored "your jquery".
[16:14:30] <TrueColors> or would it have to be jQuery.each(variable, function ( key, value ) ...
[16:14:34] <dabear> stupid bot
[16:14:35] <dabear> hah
[16:14:52] <dabear> ?your jquery
[16:14:52] <bot-t> old yeah
[16:15:16] <gnarf> bot-t: forget your jquery
[16:15:16] <bot-t> gnarf, Forgot "your jquery".
[16:15:47] <dabear> :(
[16:15:58] <TrueColors> you can give him commands o.o
[16:16:08] <gnarf> eazyigz: um...
[16:16:18] <TrueColors> is that against the rules to play with bot-t like that, gnarf?
[16:16:34] <gnarf> eazyigz: there is no need for a callback to $.each
[16:16:47] <gnarf> you can just execute code right after the $.each
[16:16:48] <dabear> bot-t likes being played with
[16:17:03] <eazyigz> gnarf: I am running jquery in node.js.  It is completely asynchronous
[16:17:21] <gnarf> eazyigz: jQuery.each is not asynchronus
[16:18:06] <gnarf> if the function in your each is, then you are asking about something different, which is how can you attach a callback to the completion of all of the asynch calls
[16:18:08] <gnarf> right?
[16:18:22] <gnarf> and the answer is going to be Defferred,
[16:18:32] <gnarf> and when
[16:18:52] <gnarf> TrueColors: you shouldn't be playing with the "factoids"
[16:19:01] <gnarf> like defining new ones...
[16:19:40] <TrueColors> can't you program him to to only let moderators define new 'commands' ?
[16:20:35] <JesperA> Yeah i am an idiot and sucks and everything but any smart jQuery awesomeness people here?: http://jsfiddle.net/VfA8V/ <-- i dont want to show/hide the stuff when clicking on the link, i want to add/remove "height: auto;" instead of display: block;/display: none;, anyone that have time to help me?
[16:22:30] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/kZDfT/2/ unexpected : ... messages: []
[16:24:31] <gnarf> TrueColors: we could, but the amount of effort is prolly not worth it, besides, you might have a factoid you want to define
[16:25:04] <gnarf> TrueColors: [error: ] isn't valid
[16:25:06] <gnarf> its { error : }
[16:25:30] <gnarf> if it has string keys, its an object - if its indexed from 0...length-1 its an array
[16:26:29] <imsky> i love the smell of jquery in the morning

[16:28:15] <abjorn> although its not morning

[16:29:35] <imsky> i sent a crapload of people on linkedin an invite to a new social network
[16:29:56] <imsky> feelings of remorse and regret are dominating right now
[16:30:15] <imsky> I REGRET GIVING YOU CHOICE
[16:32:37] <TrueColors> Oh, I do use position: fixed
[16:35:56] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/kZDfT/3/ ok this ... works, but it's using position: fixed; you can scroll down and the message is still there (I'm going to add in a X to close it) um
[16:37:41] <TrueColors> however, if I had two messages, eg: success and warning, or something. How can I perhaps... push the other messages down as prepended, if you get what I mean? This is a sample with two messages. http://jsfiddle.net/kZDfT/4/
[16:37:55] <TrueColors> as you see, it has top: 0; with both.. so they kinda.. go ontop of each other
[16:38:15] <imsky> put them into a structure with a box model?
[16:38:19] <imsky> like a <div> tag for instance
[16:38:34] <TrueColors> I don't understand
[16:38:41] <imsky> what don't you understand
[16:39:01] <TrueColors> put them both in a container which has the position: fixed; ?
[16:39:09] <TrueColors> one container for both messages
[16:39:10] <TrueColors> .?
[16:39:11] <imsky> sure why not
[16:39:13] <abjorn> hhrrrnnng why linux WHHHYYYYYY why must you give me vague error messages
[16:39:22] <imsky> lolol
[16:39:25] <abjorn> execvp(): No such file or directory
[16:39:27] <abjorn> WHAT FILE
[16:39:39] <imsky> wait wat
[16:39:39] <TrueColors> maybe it's expecting a file...
[16:39:45] <TrueColors> and you're not putting one in...
[16:39:55] <abjorn> i am tho
[16:40:04] <TrueColors> then it doesn't exist? :P

[16:41:57] <abjorn> nahhh commonjs didn't screw me
[16:42:15] <abjorn> what's weird is I have another line of code in the same file that does this:
[16:42:15] <imsky> hmm can you do a different call?
[16:42:15] <abjorn> child_process.spawn("node build.js");
[16:42:23] <imsky> oh
[16:42:26] <imsky> did you escape the slash?

[16:44:42] <imsky> did you be a dumbass?
[16:44:46] <abjorn> i did be a dumbass
[16:44:55] <imsky> you yelled at linox

[16:45:05] <imsky> TrueColors: with jaboscript
[16:45:07] <abjorn> wait, no it's not
[16:45:11] <abjorn> it's not in the child process

[16:45:18] <imsky> abjorn: err, is it executing any file?
[16:45:25] <abjorn> no
[16:45:31] <imsky> not even build.js?
[16:45:43] <abjorn> it WAS executing a file, but i commented that out
[16:45:57] <imsky> hmm can you read stdout from a child process?
[16:46:07] <abjorn> yeah, that's how I'm getting the error

[16:47:57] <imsky> carlos: you need to bind events on any new DOM elements. or use delegate/live to bind forever
[16:50:38] <imsky> abjorn: how long are you gonna take with that helloworld.js
[16:52:38] <abjorn> sorry, i've already done that, no problemo there
[16:52:41] <abjorn> still checkin it out
[16:52:48] <imsky> damn
[16:52:55] <imsky> well i just thought you should know
[16:53:09] <imsky> "If the specified filename includes a slash character, then PATH is ignored, and the file at the specified pathname is executed."
[16:53:14] <imsky> http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/exec.3.html
[16:53:23] <imsky> COULD BE YOU WERE RELYING ON A PATH VARIABLE

[17:01:46] <imsky> what the hell was your question
[17:01:47] <TrueColors> What do you think I should do with the message displays
[17:01:59] <abjorn> >.php
[17:01:59] <abjorn> well there's your problem, sir
[17:02:05] <carlos> imsky.. Ok... delegate works :)
[17:02:08] <imsky> TrueColors: i'll help you redesign your site for a reasonable fee
[17:02:12] <abjorn> lol
[17:02:14] <carlos> but i have a new question
[17:02:14] <imsky> carlos, i'm glad it did. good job, champion
[17:02:14] <abjorn> ME TOO I WILL
[17:02:15] <TrueColors> ...
[17:02:16] <abjorn> im cheaper
[17:02:20] <imsky> abjorn: you're not a designer :(
[17:02:25] <Asone> imsky : my question was about selecting element with namespace in rdf file
[17:02:25] <TrueColors> I can design, I just suck with ideas.
[17:02:25] <abjorn> I'll undercut imsky by $10
[17:02:25] <TrueColors> lol
[17:02:32] <abjorn> hey now imsky
[17:02:35] <abjorn> im getting better at it
[17:02:36] <imsky> abjorn: i will split $10 with you if you don't compete
[17:02:40] <abjorn> o ok
[17:02:42] <abjorn> sur
[17:02:51] <imsky> I AM A MONOPOLY JUGGERNAUT
[17:02:54] <abjorn> lmfao
[17:02:57] <carlos> in the moment to execute de delegate code, this code repeat
[17:03:11] <abjorn> you ever actually had anyone in #jquery contract you to do work for them, imsky?
[17:03:20] <imsky> several people
[17:03:22] <TrueColors> but anyway, basically for the messages... what would you like the messages to do? stay there until one clicks the X (when I do that bit) or.. slide up after so long, fade out after so long.. or what?
[17:03:23] <abjorn> word
[17:03:24] <abjorn> me2
[17:03:34] <imsky> irc is kind of a tech social proof
[17:03:38] <abjorn> inorite?
[17:03:40] <imsky> if you can figure out an irc client, you're not a retard
[17:03:45] <abjorn> lol
[17:04:03] <imsky> TrueColors: are you reimplementing the MANY growl clones for jquery?
[17:04:13] <TrueColors> growl clones?
[17:04:16] <imsky> yes
[17:04:29] <TrueColors> What's a growl ... assuming you mean something other than a dog growl
[17:04:34] <abjorn> idk imsky I've known some questionable people who could figure out irc

[17:04:40] <Asone> [software] [javascript]
[17:04:40] <Asone> XML Namespace Selectors for jQuery
[17:04:40] <Asone> I hit my first real roadbump with jQuery yesterday, a missing feature that really made me stop and stare in puzzlement: jQuery doesn't support xml-namespace selectors.
[17:04:44] <Asone> 'k got my answer
[17:04:46] <carlos> imsky at the moment to execute de delegate code, this code duplicate the action
[17:04:46] <Asone> ( sorry for flood )
[17:04:59] <imsky> carlos: paste your code in jsfiddle
[17:05:04] <abjorn> "jQuery doesn't support xml-namespace selectors" man who cares, fuck xml
[17:05:11] <imsky> seriously
[17:05:14] <Asone> was wrong
[17:05:18] <Asone> looks like it's possible
[17:05:24] <Asone> $(doc).find("D\\:response")
[17:05:31] <abjorn> yeah, I mean it probably does support it but
[17:05:31] <imsky> i lost my heart under the bridge
[17:05:31] <Asone> from there : http://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/xmlns-selectors-jquery/
[17:05:34] <imsky> to that little girl
[17:05:39] <abjorn> wut
[17:05:47] <imsky> you're too young padawan
[17:05:52] <imsky> to know of pj harvey
[17:05:55] <abjorn> weeeee chased misprinted liiiess
[17:06:00] <abjorn> weeeeeeeee face the path of tiiime
[17:06:04] <TrueColors> yeah kinda imsky, I was looking for something similar to that, but for success error messages in the center.. you know what I mean.
[17:06:07] <carlos> ok
[17:06:09] <abjorn> and yet i fight, and yet i fight, this battle all aloone
[17:06:10] <TrueColors> I was tlaking to someone... about a facebook effect of it.
[17:06:12] <imsky> TrueColors: yeah, one second
[17:06:14] <TrueColors> but i can't remember how theirs work
[17:06:18] <abjorn> facebook effect
[17:06:26] <abjorn> look up
[17:06:26] <Asone> imsky : you lost your heart to a little girl
[17:06:27] <abjorn> facebox
[17:06:31] <Asone> that sounds pedonazi to me
[17:06:31] <abjorn> ?facebox
[17:06:32] <bot-t> abjorn, Facebox | jQuery Plugins - Facebox is a jQuery-based, Facebook-style lightbox which can display images, divs, or entire remote pages. It's easy to use and easy to drive programmatically -- use it for error messages, confirma... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/facebox
[17:06:35] <TrueColors> no i don't want a facebox.
[17:06:41] <TrueColors> I have lightbox for that lol
[17:06:43] <TrueColors> but i mean..
[17:06:45] <imsky> asone, lolol your stupid is showing
[17:06:46] <abjorn> I'll box your face.
[17:06:54] <Asone> imsky : never said i was clever
[17:07:03] <TrueColors> for their notifications, I remember years ago - it use to pop up on the bottom left. I wanted the same fade/slide or whatever they used (i can't remember, but i knew it was nice)
[17:07:04] <abjorn> He never said that you said that you're clever
[17:07:18] <TrueColors> but anyway, I like to make my own plugins, it's part of the learning process imo. :)
[17:07:25] <Asone> is that a troll party or what ? :p
[17:07:30] <imsky> TrueColors: you'll be remaking an OLD plugin
[17:07:34] <abjorn> imsky: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud9gVs-H9d8
[17:07:40] <TrueColors> yes I would be.
[17:07:46] <TrueColors> atleast I learn though?

[17:08:08] <noobie25> i'm trying to append a div class like so:    $("#mydiv").append('<div class="anotherdiv">') but it also creates a closing </div> tag which i don't want'
[17:08:22] <abjorn> man, imsky, it's like...everyone wants you.
[17:08:35] <imsky> abjorn: holding up a lighter listening to this

[17:10:53] <abjorn> word
[17:10:59] <TrueColors> needs a bit of styling but that's like something i'd use, imsky
[17:11:01] <imsky> TrueColors: take a look at that, it's 3 years old and does what you want
[17:11:02] <noobie25> anyone know why my .append() is also creating a closing </div> tag when i don't put it there?
[17:11:43] <TrueColors> when would you not use an append without a close tag?
[17:12:28] <abjorn> hm im hungry
[17:12:34] <abjorn> i feel like some whataburger because its delicious
[17:13:15] <noobie25> TrueColors,    i wanted to add some html using the 'append'.   first an outer div and then a inner div.   I called append multiple times to achieve this...it wrong this way?
[17:14:21] <TrueColors> well, you could just do.. var html = "your html"; $("body").append("<div>" + html + "</div>");
[17:14:37] <TrueColors> or stick an id/class onto the div and do $("#id").html(" ... "); ?
[17:15:22] <noobie25> TrueColors,   thanks...let me try that really quick.
[17:23:23] <TrueColors> http://87.102.124.202/projects/JLT/contact.php okay imsky, tried it out.. click send, it's.. not really being a fixed loser lol.
[17:23:29] <JesperA> isnt it possible to animate between 2 heights, one with height 75px and one with height auto?
[17:23:44] <TrueColors> yes you can.
[17:23:47] <TrueColors> well
[17:23:54] <TrueColors> I've animated between two set heights, but not auto
[17:24:05] <JesperA> yeah, it seems like auto is not working
[17:24:45] <TrueColors> .animate({ height: 'auto'; })
[17:24:45] <TrueColors> ?
[17:25:11] <owen`t> no
[17:25:19] <owen`t> cant you use slideDown
[17:25:32] <owen`t> on the auto height
[17:27:20] <JesperA> nope, doesnt seem to work
[17:27:22] <gnarf> "auto" is almost impossibe to detect
[17:27:51] <min|dvir|us> How do I check if two jQuery objects are equal?
[17:28:15] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: meaning? they contain the exact same dom elements?
[17:28:28] <JesperA> gnarf detect? I just want it to add height: auto; to the div style=""
[17:28:38] <gnarf> JesperA: using an "animation" ?
[17:28:43] <TrueColors> but... an yway, imsky - http://87.102.124.202/projects/JLT/contact.php the messages aren't appearing ontop of the page unlike in the demo you linked to. Is there something I'm doing wrong?
[17:28:56] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: Yes.
[17:29:01] <gnarf> JesperA: can you tell me how many px "auto" is?
[17:29:23] <JesperA> its dynamic depending on the content that should be animated
[17:29:26] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: is it only one element?
[17:29:30] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: Yes.
[17:29:46] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: jq1[0] === jq2[0]
[17:29:51] <min|dvir|us> That's ugly.
[17:29:59] * courpse luls.
[17:30:16] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: but it works
[17:30:29] <min|dvir|us> gnarf: Any other working solutions?
[17:30:54] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407825/how-to-compare-two-element-in-jquery/2407893#2407893
[17:31:11] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: that is going to be by far the most performant
[17:31:14] <gnarf> but
[17:31:22] <gnarf> you may be able to jq1.is( jq2 )
[17:31:34] <gnarf> but i have no idea how well that will work with multiple
[17:31:35] <min|dvir|us> Why 'may'?
[17:31:42] <TrueColors> changed position: relative; to static.
[17:31:45] <TrueColors> no idea why it was doing that
[17:31:46] <TrueColors> i mean, fixed.
[17:32:12] <TrueColors> yueah, their demos used fixed, but their css in github uses relative. fail
[17:32:13] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: I'm guessing? You most definately could jq1.is( jq2[0] )
[17:32:22] <gnarf> JesperA: so, this "dynamic" value
[17:32:29] <gnarf> exactly what is is you wanted to animate to again?
[17:32:45] <gnarf> JesperA: (do you see the reason you can't animate to "auto" yet?
[17:32:57] <abjorn> ohhh snappp buddy guy concert coming up
[17:33:20] <gnarf> abjorn: nice, don't miss it :)
[17:33:54] <abjorn> i sure wont
[17:34:05] <abjorn> oooo and a bb king concert in octoober
[17:34:09] <JesperA> gnarf, nope? When the browser have rendered the page it has a fixed value even if the css was set to auto
[17:34:23] <gnarf> abjorn: spotify:track:7JECM65zNFrYIHdvxj8NbO
[17:34:24] <socialhapy> ★ Buddy Guy - Baby Please Don't Leave Me (Popularity: ▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯) ★ http://bit.ly/nkvIj5
[17:34:28] <gnarf> :)
[17:34:51] <gnarf> JesperA: right, but unless you a) set it to auto, b) read the value c) set it back d) animate to it
[17:34:54] <gnarf> you have no chance
[17:35:09] <gnarf> and that could potentially cause a "flash" of your animated content
[17:35:11] <abjorn> L:D
[17:35:47] <gnarf> not even the CSS3 transitions can handle animating to height: auto
[17:36:56] <JesperA> ok, well, in this case its probably better to just toggleClass
[17:36:57] <gnarf> JesperA: so, it "is possible" but jQuery can't do it out of the box
[17:37:04] <gnarf> JesperA: :)
[17:37:40] <gnarf> JesperA: you can still do the set it, read it, set it back, animate trick
[17:37:50] <imsky> wooo
[17:38:03] <gnarf> thats what toggleClass does
[17:38:41] <gnarf> if you're talking about the animated toggleClass in UI
[17:38:52] <imsky> abjorn: my new favorite emoticon :U
[17:39:47] <abjorn> lol
[17:40:23] <imsky> what's going on in #jquery
[17:40:29] <imsky> i've been gone for like 20 minutes
[17:40:32] <imsky> the world has changed so much
[17:41:46] <JesperA> gnarf yeah but its irritating to not know the height of an autoelement, like 'lol', 500 is a nice speed for some elements but doesnt fit an element with a completely different hight
[17:42:15] <imsky> who's jean-luc tallis
[17:42:48] <imsky> is he related to robert paulson
[17:44:23] <JesperA> darn it
[17:44:31] <gnarf> gotta run
[17:44:37] <gnarf> ?glwt
[17:44:37] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[17:51:52] <TrueColors> whos socialhapy
[17:52:22] <TrueColors> imsky, I'm Jean-luc ...
[17:52:23] <TrueColors> lol
[17:52:31] <TrueColors> and no I'm not related to robert paulson (no idea who he is)
[17:52:47] <imsky> TrueColors: lol sup bud
[17:53:02] <TrueColors> bud? Do you know me? lol
[17:53:36] <imsky> no i'm just naturally friendly
[17:54:13] <TrueColors> I try to be, doens't always turn out that way when I'm irritated.
[17:54:45] <imsky> lol
[18:00:47] <intellilogic> I want to do a find(':input') but I want to exclude buttons, whats the best way?
[18:01:02] <imsky> damn that's a good query
[18:02:13] <imsky> intellilogic: "input:not([type='button'])"
[18:02:55] <coldhead> $('input').not(':button')
[18:03:10] <imsky> aren't you fancy
[18:03:23] <coldhead> lazy
[18:03:25] <coldhead> i am lazy

[18:08:15] <imsky> lol wow
[18:09:21] <imsky> firefox is faster with all in selector, too
[18:09:36] <coldhead> you do good perf tests, imsky
[18:09:42] <coldhead> i'm going to outsource all my tests to you
[18:09:50] <imsky> i shall take on this new responsibility with honor
[18:11:50] <coldhead> woah this is unexpected http://jsperf.com/excluding-input-type-of-button/2
[18:11:57] <coldhead> :not is faster than !=

[18:58:21] <DIANE> hey everyone
[18:58:26] <JesperA> hi
[19:17:07] <fotoflo> i want to actually load an image from the web (and then convert it to base64 and store it in localStorage). Should i use a $get request or is there a better way?
[19:33:24] <K1ng> how do i call parents $.colorbox from iframe?
[19:35:19] <coldhead> i think that's a fine way, fotoflo
[19:36:16] <fotoflo> coldhead: and the data sent to the callback will actually be the image?
[19:37:51] <Chat1417> hola
[19:39:25] <abjorn> coldheaddddddddddddddddddddd
[20:09:52] <Jarred> Hi all, so I'm having issues with scope (I think that's the underlying problem). In my code (http://3i5k.localtunnel.com/homework/1/grade) it's invoking the functions being called inside of nextQuestion() and previousQuestion(). This is leading to it producing the wrong result. How do I fix this?
[20:15:17] <runvnc> I don't understand what the problem is
[20:15:22] <runvnc> I am looking at the code
[20:15:28] <runvnc> you are saying its producing the wrong result
[20:15:34] <runvnc> what is it supposed to produce
[20:17:07] <runvnc> I don't see why you need both a question number and an answer number
[20:17:16] <runvnc> isn't the question # and answer # always the same?
[20:17:36] <runvnc> why dont you just use one variable var questionNumber = 1;
[20:17:59] <runvnc> then questionNumber++ in the click
[20:18:51] <runvnc> why would you want to individually switch question/answer? I mean why would you display question number 3 and leave answer #2 showing?
[20:20:29] <Jarred> No
[20:20:36] <Jarred> Questions have many answers within them
[20:20:55] <Jarred> check out http://3i5k.localtunnel.com/homework/1/grade.json
[20:21:43] <runvnc> ok well I say you just keep question and answernum in variables
[20:21:55] <runvnc> instead of pulling it out of the thing with jquery
[20:22:03] <runvnc> maybe thats whats not working
[20:22:48] <Jarred> The information is inside the DOM
[20:22:50] <Jarred> While that would work
[20:22:54] <Jarred> It's not a favorable solution
[20:23:04] <Jarred> because then I have to store state within my program
[20:23:07] <Jarred> and I want it to be stateless
[20:24:45] <runvnc> it says window[questions] or whatever is not defined
[20:24:49] <runvnc> are you looking at the error log
[20:24:52] <Jarred> Yes
[20:24:52] <runvnc> are you using firebug
[20:24:53] <Jarred> but
[20:24:55] <Jarred> yes
[20:25:02] <Jarred> but it is most definitelyd defined
[20:25:19] <Jarred> call the content within nextQuestion() while the page has loaded
[20:25:25] <Jarred> Copy and paste it
[20:26:21] <runvnc> youre saying the error message is incorrect?
[20:26:28] <Jarred> No
[20:26:34] <Jarred> It's not defined at the time it's being called
[20:26:44] <Jarred> or rather
[20:27:07] <Jarred> The function getActiveQuestion() should be called when nextQuestion() is called
[20:27:08] <Jarred> not
[20:27:14] <Jarred> on runtime
[20:28:23] <Jarred> ohhh
[20:28:25] <Jarred> I'm stupid
[20:28:30] <Jarred> I have the dom elements misnamed
[20:28:36] <Jarred> next_question should be previous_question
[20:28:39] <Jarred> and vice versa
[20:29:11] <runvnc> ok then switch them
[20:29:17] <runvnc> but don't you need to call loadData?
[20:29:22] <Jarred> Yes
[20:29:31] <Jarred> Hold on
[20:29:35] <runvnc> oh it calls loaddata
[20:30:17] <runvnc> I think maybe not
[20:30:23] <runvnc> its like you defined it module style
[20:30:27] <runvnc> but loaddata is not in the module
[20:30:30] <runvnc> and you never executed it
[20:31:01] <runvnc> I say just take off that extra function() and {}
[20:31:25] <Jarred> function(){} is the same as writing "$(document).ready()
[20:31:27] <runvnc> where you are going $(function() and stuff get rid of that
[20:31:40] <Jarred> function(){}
[20:31:45] <Jarred> It's just the shorthand form
[20:42:19] <coldhead> wat
[21:06:31] <pepsiguzzler> can someone take a look at my code, im trying to do a scrollTO function and it keeps popping down to the letter instead of scrolling http://pastebin.com/HVkGqpwC
[21:16:14] <Axsuul> If i select multiple elements.. $('li'), how do I get the second element.. $('li').get(1) right? Then can I get the second element's id like so? $('li').get(1).attr('id')
[21:19:45] <formers> Hi I'm stumpped by the following : var tmp = $("<div id=1>test</div>"); tmp.append("<span id=2>test 2</span>"); I'm not getting span inserted between the div tags
[21:22:22] <Axsuul> formers: it should be $('#1')
[21:23:05] <danzik17> Axsuul: $('li').eq(1).attr('id')
[21:23:15] <Axsuul> thanks danheberden
[21:23:18] <Axsuul> danzik17*
[21:28:25] <formers> Axsuul: it's not on the dom yet

[23:11:47] <intellilogic> dr0id: the closest form
[23:12:21] <dr0id> form doesn't have/needs a name attribute
[23:12:28] <dr0id> its like .attr('name') anyway
[23:45:23] <beanluc> Hello, I am trying to capture the .change event on a checkbox... can't get it working. Any thoughts? My selector is the checkbox's ID
