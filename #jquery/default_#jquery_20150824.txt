[00:02:58] <_genuser_> hello folks. I'm looking to use something to do auto complete. auto complete will use remote data. I would like something like twitter @__ and have it be triggered only on a username.
[00:03:20] <_genuser_> I've already implement typeahead by twitter. I'm currently implementing Select2. I know jquery has autocomplete.
[00:03:53] <_genuser_> I'd be interested in your experience if you've implemented something that and what was the final choice. I'm willing to do my own research and implementation.
[00:04:15] <_genuser_> but it would help if someone has any input. not being a js dev it takes me hours to get something going.
[00:05:11] <Cork> _genuser_: you mean you want to autocomplete parts of what is in an input/textarea or what?
[00:05:27] <Cork> cause just plain autocomplete a value in an input field is simple
[00:06:04] <_genuser_> Cork: yes, just plain one is simple. I have a typeahead implementation doing that.
[00:06:23] <op> Hi, is there any way to generate an ID from two strings?
[00:06:29] <_genuser_> Cork: I'm looking to: 1) autocomplete multiple values 2) trigger autocomplete for @__ (so @username).
[00:07:12] <_genuser_> Cork: if you've ever typed anything in twitter message box, or instagram message box where you can type a message @user, that's the functionality I'd like.
[00:07:19] <nodist> op an id as in #id on a webpage?
[00:07:36] <op> nodist, it can be yeah!
[00:07:41] <Cork> _genuser_: actually no i haven't, :)
[00:07:53] <Cork> but it sounds like what you're looking for is an inline autocomplete
[00:07:53] <nodist> for a second I was thinking about databases
[00:08:17] <Cork> op: ids in a webpage is just a string, so just concat the strings and you have it
[00:08:30] <_genuser_> Cork: yeah, I suppose an inline-autocomplete makes more sense. Is there any recommendation you have on that?
[00:09:02] <Cork> i've used a few, but that was a long time ago, not even sure they work anymore
[00:09:05] <Cork> so, no not really
[00:09:32] <_genuser_> Cork: alright, I'll google using "inline-autocomplete".
[00:09:57] <Cork> _genuser_: another option could be to search for... tag autocomplete
[00:09:58] <_genuser_> Cork: I think typeahead would have been ok for a lot of my work but the main dev seems pretty insistent that "multiple" wor autocomplete is just not his goal.
[00:10:09] <Cork> i THINK twitter have a lib somewhat like that
[00:10:32] <_genuser_> Cork: typeahead by twitter is what I'm using. I don't know if they have another one.
[00:10:59] <nodist> op q quick example -> http://jsfiddle.net/tfgkL0zz/
[00:11:41] <rollingWolf> typeahead is kickass :)
[00:12:09] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: does it autocomplete multiple words? latest I find is, it doesn't. and the closed the issue as "wontfix"
[00:12:51] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: heh, I got a handlebar template going and the overall autocomplete working exactly the way I wanted. Until I realized it can't do multiple words.
[00:13:26] <rollingWolf> _genuser_ Not entirely sure what you mean with multiple words, but on the page I use it on i search for eg:  "add user"  and "add_existing_user_to_blog" appears
[00:13:49] <rollingWolf> might hit on "add a user" too
[00:14:08] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: right, but once you pick a suggestion, if you start typing in again, it won't trigger autocomplete
[00:14:40] <rollingWolf> _genuser_ =
[00:14:42] <rollingWolf> ?
[00:15:43] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: 1) I use it with remote data. 2) user names. 3) I type in "u", it shows "user1", "user2", "user3, 4) I pick "user1", space, and press u, another suggestion list don't trigger.
[00:16:08] <_genuser_> in fact, it will then consider my search to be "user1 u" and show my "not found" template that nothign matching "user1 u" was found.
[00:16:22] <rollingWolf> _genuser_ Ah ok . . We have different uses then
[00:16:33] <rollingWolf> _genuser_ I dont use it as autocomplete for your case
[00:17:06] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: I'm trying to replicate twitter/instagram functionality, where you can type in messages directed at users. example "hellow @user1 you should meet @user2"
[00:17:20] <rollingWolf> Yea I understand
[00:17:46] <Cork> _genuser_: have you tried https://github.com/yuku-t/jquery-textcomplete
[00:18:06] <_genuser_> rollingWolf: I can use simple jquery to determine if someone is at the point of "hello @u", but I suppose I could research launching a fresh typeahead list under the box.
[00:18:25] <Cork> or http://ichord.github.io/At.js/
[00:19:05] <_genuser_> Cork: no, but this is good suggestions. that's kinda why I asked (altho, I was hoping somebody has done somethign like use case).
[00:19:34] <Cork> _genuser_: those was just two quick googles
[00:19:43] <Cork> there are plenty of them out there
[00:19:50] <_genuser_> Cork: textcomplete looks very promising. let me checking out second one.
[00:19:57] <_genuser_> Cork: yeah, I think I was just search autocomplete.
[00:20:09] <_genuser_> and I had found jquery-autocomplete, typeahead, and select2.
[00:20:18] <Cork> _genuser_: i searched for jquery autocomplete textarea :)
[00:20:19] <_genuser_> my approach was to implement all of those in a sample and see which one works best.
[00:20:28] <Cork> and jquery autocomplete username
[00:20:50] <_genuser_> yeah, I think I didn't refine my search terms after refining my use case.
[00:21:05] <_genuser_> it is embarrassing ot have people do google searches for you.
[00:21:06] <Cork> :)
[00:21:11] <_genuser_> I appreciate it. :)
[00:21:41] <_genuser_> ok, thanks all, I think I have enough libs to look at. I'll start implementing these.
[00:23:02] <_genuser_> haha: The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in these documents are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
[00:53:45] <_genuser_> Cork: pretty cool. At.js does the job well.
[00:54:12] <_genuser_> altho, the other one textcomplete looks more powerful.
[00:55:00] <Cork> nice
[01:24:02] <WebDevB> Hey guys, anyone around?
[01:28:51] <WebDevB> Anyone around?
[01:44:41] <Cork> ?ask @ WebDevB
[01:44:50] <Cork> ... stupid bot
[01:45:12] <Cork> WebDevB: don't ask to ask, or if ppl are around just ask the question so ppl can answer it when they see the question
[02:03:22] <_genuser_> Cork: so this at.js was pretty cool, until lack of documentation, lol.
[02:03:38] <Cork> heh
[02:03:51] <_genuser_> there's so many plugins out there and each one has just a little different something and they're all just floating about doing nothing amazing.
[02:03:55] <Cork> i usually just read the source code
[02:04:08] <_genuser_> hmm, I should probably just do that.
[02:04:16] <_genuser_> otherwise, it's a pretty great thing. does exactly what I want.
[02:04:16] <Cork> if i can't get the uncompressed source code, or it is too hard to follow i take that as an indication i shouldn't use it
[02:04:52] <_genuser_> makes sense.
[02:05:07] <_genuser_> I guess the "let's find something quick and use it" stuff doesn't work as fast.
[02:05:13] <Cork> basically i have a criteria for every lib i load into a page: i should be able to take over the maintenance of the lib if it was dropped by the developer
[02:05:27] <Cork> and that includes frameworks :)
[02:05:34] <_genuser_> I used to want to code everything myself after understanding how it was done.
[02:05:54] <_genuser_> but overtime, I have realized, I can't possibly learn everything. let others do what they do best and let me focus on the task at hand.
[02:05:54] <Cork> na, that is usually a bad idea
[02:06:10] <Cork> but you shouldn't use something you don't understand
[02:06:22] <Cork> cause then it is just a black box, and if it breaks you're screwed
[02:06:28] <_genuser_> but it sometimes ends up in a situation where I'm just trying to get smething to work to decide if I'll use it.
[02:07:01] <_genuser_> yeah, that's kinda why I was trying to go with twitter typeahead. but when I saw the dev's response to a feature request, I know he seems like a control freak.
[02:07:09] <_genuser_> and if he drops support, he probably wo'nt hand over the project either.
[02:07:38] <Cork> as long as the source code is out there and licensed decently the project doesn't matter
[02:08:27] <_genuser_> I'm going to focus on the functionality and then check out the source code for where documentation leaves off.
[02:08:38] <_genuser_> that's a good idea. now let's see if I can fix this little thing up with at.js
[02:20:25] <Lebbe> Cork: I wrote something up about the custom pseudo-class function in sizzle/jquery if you (or anybody else) are interested
[02:20:29] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/adt0fcfr/
[02:21:13] <Lebbe> I havent digged into source code and found why it functions like this, but I have at least find a method to do as few pseudo-class function runs as possible

[04:12:02] <lolola> hi all.How does jquery $mobile.changePage work ?
[04:12:28] <lolola> because I can't see it changing Url of the browser
[04:12:43] <lolola> so what should be used , ahref or mobile.changePage () ?
[04:16:01] <taplar> that method appears to have been deprecated in 1.4
[04:18:29] <lolola> taplar: what is the new thingy ?
[04:18:49] <taplar> http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/ yellow block at the top
[04:19:43] <lolola> taplar I have observed something odd
[04:20:00] <lolola> can I share with you somethings even though they might  sound noobish to you ?
[04:20:25] <taplar> sure, if it's about mobile though i might not be able to help though, :)
[04:21:14] <taplar> but others probably will
[04:21:28] <lolola> taplar: mobile.changePage("#test22") will not change the URL of the page
[04:21:45] <lolola> and my front and back page transition in it kind of falls apart
[04:22:09] <lolola> url is something like something.com/test.html#two
[04:22:22] <lolola> and page is of soemthing.com/test.html#one
[04:22:29] <lolola> isn't that just odd
[04:23:06] <taplar> does it actually go to the target area?
[04:23:15] <lolola> no
[04:23:27] <lolola> well yes but then suddenly comes back
[04:23:38] <lolola> as if someone clicked a back button on its own
[04:23:45] <lolola> like a mili sec transition
[04:23:52] <taplar> what does your anchor look like?
[04:24:44] <lolola> <a href="#two" data-role="button">
[04:25:11] <taplar> try changing it to <a name="two"
[04:25:19] <taplar> without the href
[04:25:28] <lolola> what does name stand for
[04:25:42] <taplar> i believe when you use anchors your targeting the name of the <a> element
[04:26:03] <lolola> I am not sure about that
[04:31:44] <taplar> yup
[04:31:45] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/eaxvtr6z/
[04:32:13] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: Hi
[04:32:17] <taplar> morning
[04:32:40] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/5/
[04:32:48] <Varun_Krishna> what is wrong with this
[04:33:20] <taplar> tell me a little bit about what your trying to do?
[04:34:18] <Varun_Krishna> I am trying to create a countdown timer in plain javascript, when I enter 80 inside the text box it should go like 80 79 78 ....
[04:37:16] <taplar> well, first off it looks like your doing a setTimeout instead of a timeinterval
[04:37:46] <taplar> which you did have in your comment at the bottom
[04:39:07] <taplar> changing that the looping starts, but your seconds-- is not updating the page, so the next interation still has the same starting seconds
[04:39:31] <Varun_Krishna> http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/6/
[04:39:33] <Varun_Krishna> not working
[04:40:03] <Varun_Krishna> yes but how to make it work ?
[04:40:31] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: don't use parseInt without a base
[04:40:44] <Cork> parseInt(num, 10)
[04:40:48] <taplar> your geting the value from the input seconds.  you'll have to update that value with the new number
[04:40:51] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Even I tried it with ,10
[04:40:54] <Varun_Krishna> wasn't working
[04:41:02] <Cork> sure, but you should always have that
[04:41:04] <Cork> ALWAYS
[04:41:14] <Varun_Krishna> Let me update my fiddle
[04:41:46] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: also i would prob use the Date object
[04:41:47] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/7/
[04:41:50] <Cork> would make this much simpler
[04:42:00] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: How ?
[04:42:06] <Varun_Krishna> new Date()?
[04:42:09] <Cork> yes
[04:42:26] <Cork> and then setSecond() with how far in the future you want to go
[04:42:36] <Cork> and then just diff that to now and you have what you want
[04:42:49] <Varun_Krishna> No I want to decrement that value what the user enters on the text box /
[04:42:52] <Cork> also use setTimeout not setInterval
[04:43:05] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: sure
[04:43:10] <Cork> that is what i meant
[04:43:22] <Varun_Krishna> Yeah
[04:43:32] <Cork> (now + seconds in the future) => end time
[04:43:47] <Cork> (end time) - now => elapse time
[04:44:26] <Cork> but remember you can't depends on setTimeout or setInterval to tick every second
[04:44:35] <Cork> so you shouldn't base it on number of ticks from it
[04:44:49] <Cork> and that is the second reason why you should use Date instead
[04:45:33] <Varun_Krishna> can't get you Cork
[04:45:55] <Varun_Krishna> http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/7/
[04:46:06] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: setTimeout(func, 1000) can take anywhere from 999ms to inf before it ticks
[04:46:12] <Cork> same with setInterval
[04:46:21] <Cork> so you can't depend on it to behave like a close
[04:46:27] <Cork> *clock
[04:46:42] <Varun_Krishna> but what is wrong now ?
[04:48:25] <bruce_lee> hello @all
[04:48:33] <bruce_lee> can anybody recommend a simple jquery html-form-validation?
[04:48:39] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/8/
[04:49:30] <Varun_Krishna> But this is not what I needed
[04:49:36] <Cork> bruce_lee: the defacto validator => jquery.validator
[04:49:53] <taplar> Varun_Krishna: look at /9
[04:50:06] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: almost you need date.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + value)
[04:50:06] <Varun_Krishna> taplar: Yes ok
[04:50:15] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: also it doesn't return the seconds it sets the date object
[04:50:41] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Oh ok
[04:50:51] <bruce_lee> thanks
[04:51:35] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: <Cork> Varun_Krishna: also it doesn't return the seconds it sets the date object ?
[04:51:55] <Cork> date gets moved forward with that amount of seconds
[04:52:24] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: from which value I do that -
[04:52:32] <Cork> var basically what the timer should do instead of seconds == 0 is now <= end
[04:52:50] <Cork> *where basically*
[04:53:27] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: and finally what you should also look into is the requestAnimationFrame
[04:53:48] <Cork> so you can have the timer wait for actually rendering the page if things want to sleep
[04:54:00] <Cork> so you don't force laptops to stay alive and things like that
[04:54:29] <Varun_Krishna> http://jsfiddle.net/8ojgd28x/10/
[04:56:09] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Seriously can;t get it.
[04:56:51] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: give me a min and i'll try to wip up an example
[04:57:12] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Thanks dude, my head is on the spin.
[05:01:18] <lolola> alot of smart people are in here

[05:06:27] <rindolf> Hi all.

[05:09:17] <taplar> coffee time
[05:09:20] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: http://jsfiddle.net/21yyq6jy/
[05:09:25] <Cork> this is just a quick hack thouggh
[05:09:30] <Cork> you would have to clean it up you're self
[05:09:52] <rindolf> Cork: you are self!
[05:10:04] <rindolf> You are not this!
[05:10:06] <Cork> (ex it doesn't pad width zeros)
[05:10:13] <Cork> heh true
[05:11:09] <taplar> lol, made me think of an old signature i saw once
[05:11:25] <taplar> about it's its not it's, it's is it is, not its
[05:11:27] <taplar> or something
[05:11:30] <taplar> it was pretty long
[05:12:02] <Cork> i'm still in the middle of coding something so i'm not fully focused ^^'
[05:12:49] <Varun_Krishna_> Cork: Ok no problem
[05:12:59] <Varun_Krishna_> http://josephfitzsimmons.com/writing-a-simple-seconds-countdown-timer-with-vanilla-javascript/
[05:13:21] <Cork> Varun_Krishna_: also the requestAnimationFrame isn't added in that example
[05:13:28] <Varun_Krishna_> the thing is if I use this it works fine, but if I change it to text box's id it is only decrementing by one
[05:13:36] <Cork> Varun_Krishna_: what i wrote is just plain js except for the event handling
[05:13:44] <rindolf> Cork: here's some focus for you - http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=43034
[05:13:52] <Cork> so make the submit event handler native and you have it (well except for the .text())
[05:15:15] <Varun_Krishna_> Cork: Can I give you the jsfiddle >
[05:17:23] <Cork> Varun_Krishna_: not sure what you asked there
[05:17:43] <Varun_Krishna_> Cork: Give m e a minute
[05:19:15] <Varun_Krishna_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/3nugdjnp/
[05:19:49] <Cork> uh... ok?
[05:20:50] <taplar> put 60sec in his countdown
[05:21:51] <Varun_Krishna_> Cork: Nope.
[05:21:56] <Varun_Krishna_> taplar: where ?
[05:21:57] <Cork> nope what?
[05:22:21] <Cork> Varun_Krishna_: i gave you a clean implementation of the timer what is it you are trying to solve?
[05:22:34] <taplar> was a joke, you said give you a minute
[05:22:38] <Cork> it won't have counting problems as the date object does it for you
[05:23:06] <Cork> well... as long as you don't go above 24h that is :)
[05:26:14] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Sorry My browser keeps on closing
[05:41:09] <lolola> is it possible that when I am typing window.location.reload("one.html#one") I am seeing window.location.reload("one.html#two")
[05:42:14] <Cork> uh
[05:42:22] <Cork> reload doesn't take a string
[05:42:47] <Cork> if you want to load a new url just do location = "one.html#one"
[05:43:26] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: and taplar  Thank you guys.
[05:45:06] <lolola> Cork I have this complex situation I am trying to fix in here.I am using mobile.changePage for going from internal pages i.e from #One to #Two.I am using rel="external" and ajax at false state.Yet When I go via these button I creaet for going to and fro from #one to #two I am getting stuck somewhere
[05:45:27] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: this will also work window.location.href("page.html"); right ?
[05:45:48] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: .href === directly on location, so yes
[05:46:10] <lolola> i.e Url shows #one but it is actually on #two
[05:46:15] <lolola> don
[05:46:24] <lolola> don't know wtf this is happening
[05:46:38] <Cork> lolola: hashes are just client side, it doesn't really change page
[05:47:06] <lolola> for the lack of better word I said internal pages XD
[05:47:35] <Cork> lolola: well reload isn't the solution
[05:47:46] <Cork> it just takes a boolean for if it should force the reload or not
[05:47:53] <lolola> plus I am supposed to keep data of input fields intact
[05:47:56] <Cork> so again you want to give location a string not reload
[05:48:11] <Cork> as you only change the hash, it won't reload the page
[05:48:48] <Mia> hey channel
[05:49:00] <Mia> is there any way to trigger an event when my video is loaded
[05:49:11] <Mia> I can get the loading process but --- not when it's loaded

[05:49:32] <Mia> (I could only start the one that triggers when media starts loading)
[05:49:34] <Cork> Mia: from a <video> element or flash?
[05:49:49] <Mia> cork oh sorry to be blurry - html5 video element
[05:50:02] <Cork> Mia: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events
[05:50:18] <Mia> cork I checked -- there is no event for loaded
[05:50:21] <Cork> what you're looking for is canplaythrough
[05:50:35] <Mia> no canplaythrough starts before loading ends
[05:50:49] <Mia> check what it says --- it just estimates if it's able to play thourgh with th current connection speed
[05:51:03] <Cork> you can't expect all devices to fit the entire video on the device
[05:51:12] <Cork> that is why it is called canplaythrough
[05:51:15] <lolola> Cork: window.location changed the hash value but did not move towards second page
[05:51:28] <lolola> I see changed url but again the page is not loaded
[05:51:36] <Cork> lolola: most likely cause the js doesn't monitor hashChange
[05:51:39] <Mia> cork I'm not looking for an "all device" solution this is just for a private project
[05:51:45] <Mia> so messy answers are accepted -
[05:51:55] <Mia> I mean I just need to know if the video is fully loaded that's it
[05:51:57] <Cork> Mia: and the event you're asking for doesn't exist for the reason i gave you
[05:52:04] <Varun_Krishna> lolola try this window.location.href
[05:52:06] <lolola> Cork: so what is the solution here
[05:52:16] <lolola> Varun_Krishna: already done that
[05:52:17] <Varun_Krishna> lolola: ^
[05:52:25] <Varun_Krishna> Oh my god.
[05:52:26] <Cork> Mia: the web doesn't use events that is impossible to implement on some devices
[05:52:56] <Mia> hmm I see cork thank you
[05:53:03] <Mia> I'll look for another way of doing this
[05:53:27] <toomus> Hi all
[05:53:35] <taplar> aloha
[05:53:47] <Cork> Mia: if you're trying to implement a video ripper or something like that, browser extensions has information not exposed to the web
[05:53:52] <Varun_Krishna> toomus hi
[05:53:54] <lolola> damn it
[05:54:06] <Varun_Krishna> lolola: what happened
[05:54:21] <Cork> lolola: the solution is to find what isn't working and fix it instead of hacking around it
[05:54:23] <lolola> can see changed url in address bar but it does not load the page
[05:54:48] <Mia> Cork, oh no not at all
[05:55:05] <Mia> I just want to craete a page which will show all of the loaded content in a folder ---
[05:55:24] <Cork> O_o
[05:55:33] <Mia> so I wanted to know how to trigger events on video completely loads Cork
[05:55:56] <Cork> you... don't want the website to load a long list of videos at the same time...
[05:56:17] <Cork> the memory usage on that will be... ugg
[07:39:43] <km4> how can i correct parse array ? I have ["2015-08-21T13:41:26.645000Z", "2015-08-17T08:21:21.496430Z", "2015-08-17T09:00:38.521434Z"] this array and I need display in my chart time and date.
[07:40:14] <km4> I getJSON and push the timestamp on this array
[07:43:43] <taplar> putting the first value in new Date() gave me: Fri Aug 21 2015 08:41:26 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)

[08:10:29] <manners> hey guys im so sorry to be annoying, im trying to use erichynds multi select but i could really do with displaying more items, Ive tried adding the size to the SELECT in the html but it seems its done somewhere else as this has no effect
[08:11:02] <manners> does anyone have any idea where i should be looking, ive check several css files but havent had any luck on finding it
[08:28:58] <km4> if ( foo != null ) { console.log('!=')l} else { console.log('=')}; what is wrong with this example ? its not work on me
[08:33:15] <ceramicskull> So I'm inserting jquery into my console, why does it return undefined? It's a validation script that I just want to test.
[08:33:38] <robertmaxrees> how are you "interting jquery"?
[08:33:41] <robertmaxrees> *inserting
[08:33:49] <ceramicskull> through console
[08:33:55] <robertmaxrees> right - how?
[08:33:59] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting jquery's source?
[08:34:00] <ceramicskull> I was using tampermonkey but that's not doing anything either
[08:34:25] <ceramicskull> I open my developer tools, copy and paste my jquery into the console
[08:34:48] <ceramicskull> then it just says <- undefined
[08:34:51] <km4> ok its now fine, bad past "if" in code, my bad
[08:35:06] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty normal ceramicskull - what happens if you do $.fn.jquery after that?
[08:35:52] <ceramicskull> fn is undefined lol
[08:36:13] <robertmaxrees> could you make a paste of what you're putting in your console then?
[08:36:19] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here.
[08:36:34] <ceramicskull> http://jsfiddle.net/dkarzcux/
[08:37:06] <robertmaxrees> oh - you have a script that uses jquery that you want to test.
[08:37:16] <robertmaxrees> sounds like jquery isn't even loaded on the page.
[08:38:28] <ceramicskull> actually, it is, straight from the CDN of jquery
[08:38:52] <robertmaxrees> if $.fn.jquery is undefined, it's not properly loaded. check your network tab to make sure you're not getting a 404.
[08:39:05] <ceramicskull> but I've noticed I've had issues with trying to use $()
[08:39:42] <ceramicskull> It's 304 ok
[08:39:49] <robertmaxrees> if you're not getting a 404 or some other kind of network error, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dkarzcux/4/
[08:39:51] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[08:40:07] <robertmaxrees> if the first one works but the second one doesn't, you're in noConflict mode.
[08:43:18] <bongjovi> I'm trying to use slick (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) multiple times on a single page, can anyone explain if I should be initializing each instance of the slideshow using .each()?
[08:43:39] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees, the first one returned the number and undefined
[08:43:43] <ceramicskull> the second one didn't work
[08:43:58] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull yeah, that means you're in noconflict mode.
[08:44:02] <ceramicskull> but I thought (function ($) {} would make it so I can use $?
[08:44:30] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull that iife should work - i changed it to use the other doc ready syntax to fix that.
[08:44:34] <robertmaxrees> does that work for you now?
[08:44:52] <ceramicskull> testing
[08:45:38] <ceramicskull> yea it returned fine now >_ >
[08:46:08] <ceramicskull> but the script doesn't work, I wonder if this also negates me from testing? https://github.com/RobLoach/jquery-once
[08:46:54] <ceramicskull> The client has that loaded on their page ~_~
[08:47:58] <robertmaxrees> that might cause problems too.
[08:48:12] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi yeah, you'll probably need touse .each()
[08:48:25] <bongjovi> robertmaxrees, thanks
[08:49:05] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi unless they all have the same config options, in which case I'll bet a single selector should work just fine.
[08:49:30] <bongjovi> makes sense (some are different)
[08:49:51] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/3x33nd5e/ -- if i do output = $('.units > ul > li:first').get(0).outerHTML; how can I then edit the output variable?
[08:49:55] <anom> my jsfiddle is broke
[08:50:33] <robertmaxrees> anom what're you actually trying to do?
[08:50:47] <anom> Trying to edit the output variable.
[08:50:54] <robertmaxrees> right - why?
[08:50:54] <anom> edit the html set within a variable
[08:51:01] <robertmaxrees> open your console - it'll show you the problem.
[08:51:05] <anom> it doesnt
[08:51:26] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to get the first li?
[08:51:49] <anom> yes, and from that, I want to edit the html inside it
[08:52:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3x33nd5e/2/
[08:53:06] <robertmaxrees> output = $('.units > ul > li:first').get(0).outerHTML; is redundant - you want to just do output = $('.units > ul > li:first'); or output = $('.units > ul > li').eq(0);
[08:54:02] <robertmaxrees> also, you'll notice that your console was likely throwing an error about "class" not being a function or something similar - that's because there's no "class" method.
[08:54:13] <exs> hi
[08:54:15] <exs> have a question
[08:54:28] <anom> tar. i see.
[08:54:33] <robertmaxrees> we hopefully have an answer exs!
[08:54:39] <exs> I want something like $(this).cloest("h2") but i doesnt select the nearst element if its not in the container: https://clbin.com/v8pjj
[08:54:43] <anom> .get(0).outerHTML the same as .eq(0); ?
[08:54:56] <robertmaxrees> anom you don't want .outerHTML
[08:55:09] <exs> how can I get the above h2 of a ul structure if I selected the li before?
[08:55:14] <robertmaxrees> and .get() gets you the raw DOM node.
[08:55:20] <robertmaxrees> exs make a fiddle. instead.
[08:55:57] <exs> robbyoconnor, lol serious? so difficult to understand what I want?
[08:56:11] <robertmaxrees> exs so difficult to get my username right? ;)\
[08:56:20] <exs> robertmaxrees, ok sry
[08:56:37] <exs> my syntax is jade
[08:56:40] <robertmaxrees> and i don't know what your markup looks like.  sounds like you have an awkward combo of .prev()/prevUntil() calls to make
[08:56:48] <robertmaxrees> jquery speaks HTML :)
[08:57:05] <exs> robertmaxrees, learn jade, its a template engine, much better than plain html
[08:57:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[08:57:17] <exs> robertmaxrees, i hope you dont use plain css instead of sass and less
[08:57:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't like jade, and i'm not going to ask my company to swap the entire templating engine away from what we're already using ;)
[08:57:53] <exs> robertmaxrees, so you already use a template engine, which one?
[08:58:00] <robertmaxrees> alsO: this is jquery support - jquery doesn't know anything about your templating engine.
[08:58:12] <anom> Hmmph. I wanted to make another LI from using the existing li as a template. It seems what I need is output = $('.units > ul > li:first').clone();
[08:58:19] <robertmaxrees> right now we're using dust and underscore templates in some places, but this is painfully offtipic exs :)
[08:59:57] <exs> https://clbin.com/YBFg0
[09:00:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tubs8sc9/ - so this is your markup, right?
[09:00:32] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:00:49] <exs> robertmaxrees, exactly
[09:02:42] <exs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/tubs8sc9/1/
[09:07:20] <robertmaxrees> so this is pretty easy, but is there any reason you don't have wrappers around each h2/ul combo?
[09:08:16] <km4> how can i parse this for normal values ? [Array[2], Array[2], Array[2], Array[2]] >> [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [etc]]?
[09:08:40] <robertmaxrees> km4 what do you mean "normal"?  like, you want a flattened array?
[09:08:48] <robertmaxrees> exs http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tubs8sc9/2/
[09:09:18] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees, do you see why I wouldn't be able to test my script against another script on the page?
[09:09:32] <Elyx00> "normal" is ambiguous.
[09:09:41] <exs> robbyoconnor, ty but just to be safe, if between h2 and ul is another element. is there a method to find the next h2 traveling to the top?
[09:10:13] <km4> http://pastie.org/10372579
[09:10:25] <robertmaxrees> exs you'll need to do some kind of gross https://api.jquery.com/siblings/ and .index() combo.  i'd fix your markup at that point instead.
[09:10:42] <ceramicskull> There is already validation on the page, I was simply trying to extend it - right now I just need it working on tampermonkey, but since I try to insert it through console or tamper, it just simply ignores it and continues with the original script
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> exs like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tubs8sc9/3/
[09:11:16] <Elyx00> km4, still doesn't make sense :D
[09:11:21] <robertmaxrees> km4 make a fiddle.
[09:11:26] <km4> ok moment
[09:11:29] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused by how the console works.
[09:11:54] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull without seeing what all you're doing, I'm kind of lost.  it sounds like you're trying to develop against a site without actually opening the source.
[09:12:03] <ceramicskull> Yea pretty much
[09:12:42] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull why not just edit your dev environment then?
[09:12:44] <Elyx00> robertmaxrees, was thinking the same like he didn't click the "â–º" to expand
[09:13:09] <ceramicskull> I'm just consulting for them, so they don't give me source code
[09:13:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:13:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need a local dev environment for this site then.  otherwise you're going to have nothing but headaches :)
[09:14:33] <exs> robertmaxrees, unforthunly I cant change the markup. so I need to use sibling for search?
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> exs that's pretty bad - yeah.  though that's not guaranteed to work.  i'd really consider yelling at whoever generated the markup and have them correct it.
[09:16:29] <robertmaxrees> because right now it's not very semantically meaningful.  nesting 4 lyfe
[09:16:34] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees, yea I figured.
[09:16:40] <exs> robertmaxrees, ok i cant change the markup
[09:16:42] <ceramicskull> I just wanted to try with out the local
[09:17:02] <ceramicskull> I'll just tell them this works (I have it working on a test page) and just hand it to them lol
[09:17:05] <exs> robertmaxrees, I need to work that way. I select the ul and then I need to find the next h2 at the same level. what would you suggest for it?
[09:17:24] <exs> the next searching to the top
[09:18:03] <robertmaxrees> exs get the .index() of the current ul against all other ULs, then do a .siblings() and get the h2 that matches that the UL's index
[09:18:14] <exs> ok
[09:18:35] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees, just a question, but would you know how to explain the issue of not being able to develop against the site in non technical terms lol? I think I'm going to get them lost with this one ; p
[09:18:51] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull huh?
[09:18:59] <ceramicskull> nvm
[09:19:07] <robertmaxrees> are you relying on me to explain to your client why you can't develop without access to their source?
[09:19:10] <ceramicskull> not your problem hah
[09:19:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:22:51] <km4> heh I dont know if I put my code in jsbin its work fine ;D grr
[09:23:16] <Elyx00> Haha
[09:29:43] <exs> robertmaxrees, can you please consider my updated https://jsfiddle.net/tubs8sc9/4/ I have made a more detailed example, that is what I really try to do, I want to parse an existing markup
[09:29:59] <robertmaxrees> "parse an existing markup"?
[09:30:05] <exs> yes
[09:30:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:30:09] <exs> parse an html structure
[09:30:12] <exs> why huh`
[09:30:18] <robertmaxrees> and do what with it?
[09:30:38] <exs> to convert data
[09:31:00] <km4> http://jsfiddle.net/d898mpf4/
[09:31:03] <robertmaxrees> make your js valid first, exs
[09:31:37] <km4> i need output lite this [["2015-08-24", "12:58:24.480428Z"], ["2015-08-24", "12:58:29.072883Z"]]
[09:31:43] <exs> robertmaxrees, its valid already
[09:31:48] <robertmaxrees> exs nope, it's not.
[09:32:59] <robertmaxrees> $(function({ isn't valid - $(function() { is
[09:33:24] <robertmaxrees> you're missing commas after each of your properties in the object you're passing to that console.log()
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tubs8sc9/6/ this is valid js
[09:34:15] <exs> robertmaxrees, ah alright, sry here: https://jsfiddle.net/tubs8sc9/7/
[09:35:04] <robertmaxrees> so you still have the same problem?
[09:35:33] <robertmaxrees> you could do a recursive call to .prev() to finx that.
[09:35:48] <exs> robertmaxrees, principly yes, just gave you a more realistic structure I try to handle. I need to get the country text from the last recent h2 element at the top of a certain ul element
[09:36:07] <exs> robbyoconnor, ya thats a good idea I guess
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> then use recurive .prev() calls or get somebody to fix the markup.
[09:36:15] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete ;)
[09:42:01] <robertmaxrees> km4 why?
[09:42:24] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly the format of your array right now.
[09:46:54] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d898mpf4/1/ is a little cleaner.
[09:48:22] <robertmaxrees> km4 if you want the text of that, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d898mpf4/2/
[10:04:49] <geri> hi, what is the recommended way to reply a login request to the same page in case if the login failed and to redirect in case if the login succeeds?
[10:08:00] <taplar> huh?
[10:08:05] <Brewster> geri: ajax
[10:08:32] <taplar> i believe it's a 503 for unauthorized
[10:08:32] <Brewster> that's how I would do it anyway
[10:08:50] <robertmaxrees> you have your server issue a redirect.
[10:09:19] <taplar> sorry, 401
[10:10:31] <geri> Brewster: how does it work?
[10:12:13] <Brewster> when the user clicks the login button you write some javascript to send the login information to the server. The server will return with some data that says if the login succeeded. If it doesn't display error and if it does you can have another line of js to redirect.
[10:12:42] <geri> i return a string: "invalid username or password" if the login failed
[10:12:52] <geri> in the other case i need to redirect to the new page
[10:13:09] <robertmaxrees> either use ajax or redirect the user with a server-side redirect.
[10:14:04] <geri> but the ajax expects a xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
[10:19:40] <TwistableGolf> I'm having some serious problems with mouseenter
[10:20:22] <TwistableGolf> My selector is definitely correct but when I hover over the element nothing happens
[10:20:30] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[10:20:34] <TwistableGolf> When It's supposed to change the border colour
[10:20:39] <TwistableGolf> Alright, give me a sec
[10:26:36] <TwistableGolf> Hang on, I just tried to log when the mouse enters the element and that works, but the animation isn't playing
[10:27:35] <TwistableGolf> Are there any situations where I wouldn't be allowed to change the color of the border of an element?
[10:27:57] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to animate color change?
[10:28:06] <TwistableGolf> Yeah
[10:28:09] <TwistableGolf> This worked before
[10:28:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need a plugin or jQuery UI
[10:28:26] <TwistableGolf> I have jQuery UI on it
[10:28:29] <TwistableGolf> I'm pretty sure
[10:28:30] <TwistableGolf> Let me check
[10:28:52] <robertmaxrees> then i'd need to see your code.
[10:41:35] <km4> robertmaxrees: thanks
[10:42:08] <tekkkz> Good morning
[10:43:12] <tekkkz> i wanna handle the click at a <a> element which is inside of a ul li: $("ul > li > a").click this doesnt raise the click event...whats wrong?
[10:43:33] <robertmaxrees> do you dynamically add the a tag?
[10:43:57] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just do $('ul a') or $('ul').on('click', 'a', function() {});
[10:45:19] <TwistableGolf> Okay, so I found out what the problem is
[10:45:31] <TwistableGolf> The thing i'm looking for a mouseenter on
[10:45:33] <TwistableGolf> is inside a button
[10:45:49] <robertmaxrees> only certain elements are allowed in buttons fwiw.
[10:46:10] <TwistableGolf> The whole thing works except for the mouseenter
[10:46:25] <robertmaxrees> show the code ;)_
[10:46:27] <TwistableGolf> I've tried checking for mousenter on the button and that doesn't work either
[10:46:28] <TwistableGolf> Alright
[10:46:32] <TwistableGolf> http://jsfiddle.net/tzxah5be/
[10:46:37] <TwistableGolf> It's ridiculously messy
[10:46:44] <TwistableGolf> And badly made
[10:46:56] <tekkkz> robertmaxrees, what do you mean with dynamically?
[10:46:58] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[10:47:04] <robertmaxrees> tekkkz do you add the a tag using javascript?
[10:47:12] <robertmaxrees> TwistableGolf i'm seeing a js error in the console on that fiddle.
[10:47:14] <tekkkz> ja
[10:47:49] <TwistableGolf> Oh sorry, I didn't update it
[10:47:51] <TwistableGolf> should be fine now
[10:47:53] <robertmaxrees> tekkkz that's why your code doesn't work - the element doesn't exist at the time of binding.
[10:48:05] <robertmaxrees> tekkkz do $('ul').on('click', 'a', function() {}); instead.
[10:48:16] <tekkkz> okay this works, thx
[10:48:18] <tekkkz> byyyebye
[10:48:39] <robertmaxrees> TwistableGolf still seeing it - did you update it?  if so, mind tossing out the new link?
[10:48:56] <TwistableGolf> http://jsfiddle.net/tzxah5be/2/#
[10:48:58] <TwistableGolf> http://jsfiddle.net/tzxah5be/2/
[10:49:32] <TwistableGolf> It doesn't log when you mouse over it
[10:50:08] <robertmaxrees> because the buttons don't exist on pageload.
[10:50:17] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener here.
[10:50:26] <TwistableGolf> How would I do that?
[10:50:46] <robertmaxrees>  $(document).on('mouseenter', 'button, img, form', function () {
[10:52:54] <TwistableGolf> You are a godsend
[10:52:56] <TwistableGolf> Thank's man
[10:53:00] <TwistableGolf> Thanks*
[10:54:22] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:57:11] <TwistableGolf> For some reason, If I move my mouse fast enough across the images, some of the borders don't animate back
[10:57:19] <robertmaxrees> animation queue.
[10:57:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing.
[10:58:39] <TwistableGolf> So, how do I fix that, if it were the case?
[10:58:54] <robertmaxrees> cancel the current animation.  $(this).stop() iirc.
[10:58:56] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[10:59:50] <TwistableGolf> Don't think that's the problem
[11:00:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd give it a shot.
[11:00:12] <TwistableGolf> I just did
[11:00:14] <TwistableGolf> Didn't fix it
[11:00:24] <robertmaxrees> updated fiddle, then.
[11:00:30] <TwistableGolf> Alright, 2 secs
[11:01:03] <TwistableGolf> http://jsfiddle.net/tzxah5be/3/
[11:03:51] <robertmaxrees> oh, heh, easy.
[11:04:41] <robertmaxrees> your mouseleave function is targeting another element.

[11:06:07] <mazpe> im trying to use jQuery Bootgrid but my json is a bit different that from the exmaple: http://pastebin.com/xj1QBSWy
[11:06:18] <TwistableGolf> Now it's doing the opposite though
[11:06:25] <mazpe> is there a way to customize the data jquery Bootgrid is expecting
[11:06:27] <TwistableGolf> some things stop being able to be changed
[11:06:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:06:56] <robertmaxrees> TwistableGolf something isn't clear here.
[11:07:29] <robertmaxrees> mazpe if it's expecting data in a particular format, you need to supply it in that particular format.
[11:08:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you can .map() your array and turn it into the format you want instead.
[11:09:07] <TwistableGolf> robertmaxrees I don't think stop actually resets the animation
[11:09:10] <TwistableGolf> it just pauses it
[11:09:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:09:54] <robertmaxrees> you might also need to clear the queue
[11:11:01] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: .map() ? thats new to me.
[11:11:09] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[11:12:10] <TwistableGolf> Figured it out
[11:12:12] <TwistableGolf> .finish()
[11:12:20] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's another strategy.
[11:12:32] <TwistableGolf> Seems to be the only working one
[11:12:37] <TwistableGolf> Anyway
[11:12:39] <TwistableGolf> Problem solved
[11:12:40] <robertmaxrees> the one i shared was fine.
[11:12:43] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:12:58] <TwistableGolf> Thanks for the help
[11:13:20] <Vasa> is it possible to remove all events jquery has previously added from a certain script file in a simple way?(or just all events jquery has added is fine)
[11:13:39] <Vasa> not from a single element, from the whole page
[11:13:39] <robertmaxrees> Vasa not in a sane way.  why?
[11:14:11] <Vasa> well, I want to be able to dynamically replace a certain block in a page, and reload all the events with it, i thought it would be cleaner to remove all the events previously attached first
[11:14:30] <robertmaxrees> you should bind them with event delegation the first time around and skirt the problem.
[11:20:11] <Vasa> robertmaxtrees I think I prefer not to use delegation perfomance wise
[11:20:33] <Vasa> do you have any ideas how to address my exsisting way of dealing with it?
[11:20:40] <robertmaxrees> Vasa 2 things: 1 - don't prematurely optimize. 2 - delegation will actually work better.
[11:21:10] <Vasa> thats not prematurely optimizations, I acctualy tested delegation before, and i rather to attach events directly
[11:21:25] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a flawed test then.
[11:21:32] <robertmaxrees> because you're simply moving your overhead.
[11:21:50] <robertmaxrees> and there's really no simple way other than getting a list of every event on the particular element and then .off('the list of events') against it.
[11:22:11] <Vasa> I thought maybe jquery contains a list of all previously attached events it made?
[11:22:30] <robertmaxrees> not in a public api.
[11:24:51] <Vasa> robertmaxtress: do you think simpley deleting elements off the page is good enogh and does not require additional unbindings?
[11:24:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[11:25:22] <Vasa> this might make a memory leak?
[11:25:33] <robertmaxrees> it makes for painfully unreadable code.
[11:25:49] <robertmaxrees> and it'll be far less performant than using event delegation depending on how you do it.
[11:40:52] <Vasa> robertmaxrees : thank you, after some reading I think I am convienced to go with your way, because with delegation the startup time will be faster, even tho the runtime might be insignificantly slower
[11:42:58] <robertmaxrees> you're trading off where the performance hit will be.
[11:44:23] <Vasa> robertmaxrees true i didn't realize the difference, in direct binding you bind to each and every element, in delegation, they are all binded by just one, however i still don't quite understand why event bubbling can get slow, does it depend on how far is the parent from the child, or how many childs that parent has?
[11:44:42] <robertmaxrees> i don't see how it's any slower than a normal binding.
[11:45:26] <robertmaxrees> there's an extremely small increase because the handler needs to check if the element that emitted the event (or one of its parents) matches your selector.
[11:45:37] <Vasa> robertmaxrees : I know its premature, but technically it is slower, because it is bubbling and checking what has acctualy happend, I am just trying to figure out how to set it the most efficent way
[11:45:53] <robertmaxrees> bubbling happens anyway.
[11:46:04] <Vasa> maybe I use the wrong terms. I ment what you said
[11:46:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a native part of the browser, and it's much faster than you think it is.
[11:46:33] <Vasa> so, in order to make it perform faster i have to make the scope of the selector as small as possible
[11:46:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:46:58] <robertmaxrees> that part is irrelevant.  the performance impact will be imperceptable.
[11:47:13] <Vasa> it all depends on the scale tho
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[11:47:22] <robertmaxrees> the event will bubble regardless.
[11:47:57] <Vasa> so you say, $('.my-widget').on('click','a',function()    and $('.my-widget').on('click','#specificelement',function()
[11:48:01] <Vasa> are the same in perfomance?
[11:48:09] <robertmaxrees> to the end user, absolutely.,
[11:48:18] <robertmaxrees> because you're not actually selecting anything with that second argument.
[11:48:37] <robertmaxrees> the element is being checked against that selector.
[11:49:06] <Vasa> I see, thanks for clearing that out
[11:51:48] <CorySimmons> Hi, is there a way to automatically load/store some JSON? I made a form that queries a pretty big JSON file with $.getJSON within a button click. The problem is, it takes a few seconds to get any sort of response.
[11:52:06] <CorySimmons> I'd love to be able to just load the entire JSON the second they hit the page.
[11:52:17] <robertmaxrees> CorySimmons sure - promises.
[11:52:41] <CorySimmons> Crap. I don't know anything about promises.
[11:52:54] <robertmaxrees> var myBigUglyDataset = $.ajax(); /* then later */ myBigUglyDataset.done(function(myData) { console.log(myData) });
[11:53:26] <CorySimmons> Ah nice, thanks robertmaxrees
[11:54:20] <taplar> never made any promises, *tsk tsk tsk*
[11:54:53] <CorySimmons> Is there a getJSONP or something?
[11:54:59] <CorySimmons> Or do I just need to use $.ajax?
[11:59:30] <CorySimmons> Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://pastie.org/10372861
[11:59:36] <CorySimmons> Just trying to fetch some JSON
[11:59:47] <CorySimmons> (console.log(1) doesn't log anything to console)
[11:59:52] <CorySimmons> I'd expect it would
[12:01:44] <shoky> CorySimmons: JSONP only works if the server specifically enables/allows it
[12:01:54] <CorySimmons> Ahhhh crap.....
[12:02:00] <CorySimmons> How do I test locally then?
[12:02:15] <shoky> hm?
[12:02:28] <CorySimmons> Like I'm specifically trying to test this json on s3 to see how bad it lags when the json is on s3
[12:02:58] <robertmaxrees> req.done(function() {
[12:03:06] <shoky> didn't understand what you're trying to do
[12:03:07] <robertmaxrees> need to pass the object there.
[12:03:23] <robertmaxrees> req.done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[12:03:33] <CorySimmons> Tried that. Don't even get to that point
[12:03:40] <shoky> (you don't have to if you don't need it)
[12:03:44] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab.
[12:03:49] <CorySimmons> My script is on my local system, and the json is on s3.
[12:04:03] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not getting a network or CORS error.
[12:04:07] <CorySimmons> I'm not
[12:04:16] <CorySimmons> I do when I try it with json
[12:04:18] <shoky> you're getting a syntax error in your console probably
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> so your network tab shows the request successfully completion?
[12:04:22] <CorySimmons> But when I do jsonp I don't get the errs
[12:04:48] <CorySimmons> Yeah
[12:04:56] <CorySimmons> 200 on it
[12:04:59] <shoky> doesn't matter with jsonp if the request is 200
[12:05:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:05:16] <CorySimmons> What do you mean?
[12:06:13] <shoky> that the content needs to have a specific format
[12:06:35] <CorySimmons> The .json file on s3?
[12:06:38] <CorySimmons> It's valid json
[12:06:43] <shoky> that is, it needs to be a javascript snippet that calls a callback. read up on jsonp if you wanna know the details
[12:06:53] <shoky> a json response is NOT jsonp
[12:07:03] <CorySimmons> Okay
[12:07:03] <acidjazz> jsonp ruined my familly
[12:07:03] <robertmaxrees> for jsonp your app needs to take a callback param and wrap the JSON in said param.\
[12:07:50] <shoky> maybe s3 has a way for you to just use CORS
[12:07:53] <shoky> no idea
[12:08:01] <robertmaxrees> http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html
[12:08:05] <acidjazz> what if you hit the s3 url
[12:08:10] <acidjazz> yourself
[12:08:28] <robertmaxrees> read the section titled "How Do I Enable CORS on My Bucket?"
[12:09:04] <CorySimmons> Meh screw all this I'll just enable CORS on s3
[12:09:11] <CorySimmons> http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html#how-do-i-enable-cors
[12:09:19] <acidjazz> you just need to right click the json file and make public
[12:09:26] <acidjazz> cors is a bit more advanced
[12:09:56] <robertmaxrees> if that's all the bucket has, enable it.
[12:18:24] <CorySimmons> That was super simple
[12:18:44] <CorySimmons> Log into s3, find your bucket, go to properties > permissions > cors config > save > voila

[12:24:35] <robertmaxrees> yes, this is the place for jquery mobile
[12:24:44] <martin_g> Hi, I wonder if someone can help me. I'm tearing my hair out here. I'm using Mosene's Swipebox (https://www.mosne.it/playground/swipebox/) with Isotope (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/v1/custom-layout-modes/masonry-gutters.html) and all is going really well. EXCEPT, when I add a gutter. On a mobile (iOS at least), with the swipebox open, if you rotate to
[12:24:44] <martin_g> landscape, and then back to portrait, the images have moved along (seemingly the distance of the gutter). After inspecting the code in Chrome, I can see that there is no margin or extra translation being applied to the enlarged image, but I just can't figure out what IS causing it :(
[12:27:06] <robertmaxrees> martin_g i don't see a question ;) if you're having issues, it's hard for us to help without seeing an example of it breaking.
[12:27:43] <martin_g> I can open my server for you to see if you'd like?
[12:28:25] <martin_g> here: 89.168.62.57:8080/lividonnelly.com
[12:28:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't have any mobile devices to test with.
[12:28:33] <martin_g> ah, http://89.168.62.57:8080/lividonnelly.com
[12:28:43] <martin_g> Awh ok :(
[12:29:03] <robertmaxrees> check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[12:29:09] <robertmaxrees> it might give you some insight.
[12:30:22] <robertmaxrees> you could also try disabling different components and seeing what's causing the issue
[12:31:04] <jpb> IHi all!
[12:31:27] <robertmaxrees> hello jpb!
[12:31:50] <martin_g> I know it's down to the gutter property in the isotope plugin. (which simply adds margin onto the thumbnail), but swipebox opens another element with different classes on :S
[12:37:10] <martin_g> Here is a side by side before and after of the problem on iOS: http://i.imgur.com/xzJONq1.jpg
[12:44:33] <jpb> I have a thing that says `"$("li.foo").hide()"` for a handful of items, and then another thing that says `$("li.foo:visible").length` and it works. When I give `.hide(1000)` an argument to slow down the animation, the `.length()` stops working and I don't know why. Any ideas?
[12:46:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> martin_g check out that guide i linked.
[12:46:51] <jpb> @robertmaxrees sure, one sec
[12:51:37] <martin_g> Yeah thanks. I'll have a flick through and see if it helps me spot the culprit! :)
[13:05:22] <Ontani> Hi, i'm showing an menu button and hiding menu options with a media-query. the menu button does an slideToggle();
[13:05:49] <Ontani> but when toggled invisible and I resize my window the menu doesn't reappear
[13:06:20] <Ontani> because the slideToggle adds an display: none inline on the element. Is there any way to overcome this?
[13:14:47] <martin_g> When you resize the browser larger it doesn't reappear, Ontani?
[13:15:36] <Ontani> yeah, i've been able to fix it.
[13:16:03] <Ontani> adding !import to my style so jquery wouldn't override it
[13:16:34] <martin_g> Cool :)
[13:53:48] <bcSquared> Anyone got some good literature/viewing for implementing nvd3.js with Django? I've spent literally all day looking and can't get anything to work. even after copy/pasting from different working examples.
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working?
[13:54:49] <bcSquared> the chart/graph doesn't load. I'll post some stuff when I get home for proper debugging. I figured 4+ hours of trying to research on my own suffices
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> split up the concepts - django needs to output data in a certain format.  nvd3.js needs to consume in a certain format./
[15:07:55] <dwigton> I am iterating through an option list and calling either .show() or .hide() depending on a search parameter.  This incredibly slow. Is there a faster way to turn elements on or off? Or perhaps defer recalculating the layout until after all elements are checked?
[15:35:19] <hydraidm801> how can I loop through an array and remove all the even indicies?
[15:37:26] <robertmaxrees> do a .filter() and create a new one instead.
[15:38:34] <robertmaxrees> dwigton .clone() into a new variable, do your operations against that var, and then do a single replace.
[15:44:24] <dwigton> robertmaxrees: Sorry you mean clone the entire massive select? I am not sure I understand the replace. replaceWith()?
[15:44:43] <robertmaxrees> yes and yes.
[15:45:01] <dwigton> ok, I will give it awhirl
[15:45:10] <robertmaxrees> the idea is to operate against it outside of the document.
[15:47:06] <dwigton> Thanks, I am most likely reinventing the wheel, but could not find a decent autocomplete / dropdown combo that returns an option id instead of text. :-p
[15:48:38] <Horacsio> Hi.
[15:49:11] <Horacsio> why do I get this ReferenceError: Can't find variable: jQuery when loading <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[15:51:30] <hydraidm801> how do I say if not expression in JS ?
[15:51:49] <hydraidm801> if !(expression)  retruns an error
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio are you loading that before or after jquery?
[15:52:04] <robertmaxrees> hydraidm801 the ! goes inside the open paren.
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> if (!expression)
[15:53:17] <Horacsio> before!!!
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> hydraidm801 though i'm not sure that's going to do what you think it'll do.
[15:53:46] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio you sure about that?  no console errors?
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> and no network tab errors?
[15:55:01] <Horacsio> yes the jquery-ui and jquery-easing loaded before the jquery
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio jquery needs to be loaded first and foremost.
[15:55:19] <Horacsio> ok
[15:55:23] <robertmaxrees> then jquery ui, then jquery easing,
[15:56:07] <hydraidm801> I can't remove the even indicies. Could someone look at this fiddle? https://jsfiddle.net/yLLp5ys1/
[15:56:24] <robertmaxrees> filter returns a new fiddle.
[15:56:27] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't update in place.
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yLLp5ys1/2/
[16:29:59] <hydraidm801> why do people use functionName = fucntion(args) rather than function funcitonname(args) ?
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> encourages you to declare your functions at the top of the current scope.
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> also highlights that they're objects like any others.
[16:36:43] <hydraidm801> robertmaxrees: isn't everything in JS an object though?
[16:38:36] <anom> hai
[16:39:16] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/1vq8a52g/ is there a better way to write this? Without having to write $(output) all the time?
[16:40:02] <nodist> var output = $(output);
[16:40:32] <anom> Can I do like, .end().find(...).end().find(...)
[16:40:34] <anom> something like that?
[16:40:40] <nodist> yes
[16:41:04] <nodist> var output = $(output);  output.find('something');
[16:42:49] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/7h2okta0/ so this should work?
[16:43:41] <anom> because the .end() part is screwing it up
[16:44:13] <nodist> do you have a more complete fiddle?
[16:44:35] <anom> What i'm asking for is, if I do a .find(), is there anyway to get back to the original?
[16:45:02] <anom> $('ul').find('li').nowGoBackToUL
[16:45:12] <anom> I had thought .end() does this but apparently not
[16:45:48] <shoky_> anom: yes, .end() does that. but you're calling it before any .find
[16:48:33] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/ff1kxwmz/ nodist
[16:48:52] <anom> I'm cloning an li, and making a few changes to it.
[16:50:34] <anom> none of the .end().find(..) bits are working tho
[16:50:53] <shoky_> because it should be  .find().end()   not .end().find()
[16:51:03] <shoky_> don't call end() before find()
[16:51:36] <nodist> something like this anom like what shoky_ was saying https://jsfiddle.net/ff1kxwmz/ ?
[16:51:47] <anom> oh that first .end() after the addclass
[16:51:57] <shoky_> yes
[16:52:16] <anom> thanks guys!
[16:52:25] <anom> any recommendations on how to improve this code? :P
[16:52:36] <anom> quite new to jquery and js.
[16:54:54] <shoky_> not much that can be improved that i can see. nothing important anyways
[16:55:28] <shoky_> tho i'd prefer separate lines instead of that long .find.end chain
[16:55:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:55:40] <anom> oh
[16:55:47] <anom> I thought i was being smart with that lol
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> also, $(output) is unnecessary - just need output
[16:56:05] <jak2000> hi all
[16:56:18] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!
[16:56:26] <pokergod> how does jsfiddle do the window resizing?
[16:57:53] <robertmaxrees> do what now
[16:58:32] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, load jsfiddle, make the html window bigger
[16:59:37] <shoky_> they wrote code that does it..?
[16:59:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm lost.
[17:00:04] <shoky_> + using a drag library
[17:00:51] <shoky_> jsfiddle uses mootools, fwiw, pokergod
[17:01:07] <pokergod> yeah i saw that
[17:01:16] <pokergod> i love how they allow the windows to be resized
[17:01:49] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of clientcide it looks like.
[17:04:57] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/not-execute-a-click-event
[17:05:13] <jak2000> is mine the question... but the answer not understand at all
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> if the element doesn't exist, you can't add an event handler to it.
[17:05:53] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for a fix.
[17:08:14] <Horacsio> hi, why doesnâ€™t this http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/qmg7e4L7/1/ run? the script is inside a .js file
[17:08:39] <robertmaxrees> last line should be }());
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> not });
[17:09:20] <jak2000> robertmaxrees is for me?
[17:09:28] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio
[17:09:41] <Horacsio> thank you
[17:09:50] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i already answered your question :)
[17:10:17] <jak2000> ok reading
[17:10:27] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: whats wrong with line 6?S :S
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> gyg?>
[17:10:54] <robertmaxrees> *huh?
[17:12:32] <Horacsio> at the jshint theres a red dot on line 6
[17:12:55] <Horacsio> oh
[17:13:01] <Horacsio> it was missing a ;
[17:13:02] <Horacsio> :D
[17:13:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:14:36] <Horacsio> but this function doesnt work within my wordpress theme!
[17:14:43] <Horacsio> I get this error
[17:14:44] <Horacsio> TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'n.easing[this.easing](a,this.options.duration*a,0,1,this.options.duration)')
[17:19:50] <shoky_> Horacsio sounds lke you need to include jquery.easing plugin or jquery-ui
[17:20:10] <Horacsio> but I already included them! :S
[17:22:52] <Horacsio> shoky_: do you know wordpress wp_register_script?
[17:23:19] <shoky_> nope
[17:23:37] <Horacsio> shoky_: is there a jquery_easing under google cdn?!
[17:23:43] <shoky_> donno
[17:30:07] <s34n> I have a jquery object that I can stuff into parts of my page and it shows up just find. But if I .position() it instead, it doesn't show up, and can't be found in the DOM
[17:30:15] <pokergod> mousemove(function(e) { ... how do you get the 'y' } )
[17:32:22] <s34n> pokergod: e.pageY
[17:32:56] <s34n> pokergod: documented at http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[17:37:36] <jak2000> done....
[19:31:56] <pokergod> anyone see what i've done wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/v56x9vtv/
[19:34:45] <Zeranoe> How come jquery's .load() works without a server when opening a local file? Doesn't it use AJAX?
[19:39:56] <Woet> pokergod: check your console?
[20:09:56] <pokergod> Woet, I fixed it, however when I go to grab the splitter to drag,i cannot get on the box again
[22:20:40] <pokergod> is there a way to optimize;  $("#top").height("calc(" +y + "% - 10px)"); .. so i drop the calc()
[22:37:48] <Utils> If I have lets say, a chatroom view that i place into .content, this chatroom would have some modal windows. how would one handle the events for that? surely having one file for /every/ event even for modals that aren't shown...
[22:38:22] <snover> file?
[22:39:58] <Utils> http://pastebin.com/v3QxMnya ok so this is ... most of the ui handling for the chat. Inside ChatUI, I have ... events for simply everything.
[22:40:18] <Utils> and they are getting bigger and bigger.
[22:41:14] <Utils> is there a better way to handling it all?
[22:42:50] <Utils> its livescript code, so some of the functions have an auto-return, i need to fix them all but shouldnt' cause an issues anyway
[22:43:20] <Uhkis> damn that's a lot of code
[22:44:12] <Utils> its the biggest ui yes. but i have a view objet too. that handles things like the chat events, and then it interacts with the ui object.
[22:44:19] <Utils> and then the ui atually manipulates the dom
[22:44:31] <Utils> some ui stuff is done outside... but it is getting messy lol
[22:45:28] <Utils> i've got a user who is at that age where she struggles to remember commands, so a simple: /ban user duration, is too much for her and she wants a button to click. so i have to add in modal windows which means more events and im starting to trip over mself
[22:48:44] <Utils> I already know that i dont need to ".off" events. although the chat can be intiialised twice (say if a user disconnects) and tehn the events end up set again so they become set twice. so idk about that.
[22:49:28] <Utils> but some of my event bindings can be made simpler by passing a function to them instead of cluttering it all up
[22:51:09] <snover> it is probably time for you to move beyond jquery to something that is actually a ui library like dijit or react
[22:55:20] <Utils> I was afraid of that, to be honest. it's not easy getting familiar with new things.
