[00:00:23] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: and why are you replacing the button?
[00:00:54] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: just because... can you fix it?
[00:01:19] <purejargon> hi all. am trying to use the jqGrid plugin for grails application to display the data retrieved from table in grid. but my grid does not seem to be working for some reason. all i get is a strip of bacdkground
[00:01:48] <shoky> ?eror
[00:01:49] <bot-t> it give eror
[00:01:57] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/1/
[00:04:04] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: interesting. I guess you can't fix it by echoing the dom like i did.
[00:04:07] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: you can't mix strings and dom elements
[00:04:31] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: i know, so can you convert the dom into a string.
[00:04:34] <Cork> ?eval 'string' + document.createElement('div')
[00:04:35] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[00:04:41] * Cork hits bot-t 
[00:04:56] <purejargon> this is the type of background i am getting. http://imagebin.org/220158
[00:04:58] <purejargon> any ideas?
[00:05:02] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/ <-- fix that by converting the dom into a string? possible?
[00:05:31] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: you shouldn't convert doms to string if you don't have to
[00:05:51] <Cork> and the get new img tag doesn't make any sence
[00:05:56] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ok. but can you do it?
[00:06:16] <Cork> its the same selector your using earlier, so it will just replace the variable with the same pointer
[00:06:30] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: well if i change the img src, i have to get the img tag again
[00:06:32] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: didn't the example i give you work?
[00:06:35] <Cork> no
[00:06:42] <Cork> your updating the dom object
[00:06:55] <Cork> so it will have the new src value
[00:07:02] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ok
[00:07:03] <maloik> Is it possible using jQuery (preferably) to check if a certain element is in fact focused, and if it is, detaching the enter button from submitting the form and instead do something else or nothing at all ?
[00:07:12] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: you should remember that dom is not html
[00:07:16] <Cork> its a big difference
[00:07:19] <david`> Cork i can`t thank you enough
[00:07:26] <david`> so thank you again ^_-
[00:07:59] <Cork> maloik: you would have to track focused elements your self
[00:08:15] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ok, i updated it to http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/2, can you fix it by converting the dom into a string just for learning purposes?
[00:08:28] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: and yes your example works fine.
[00:08:39] <Cork> maloik: you could try using document.activeElement, but i don't remember how well supported it is
[00:09:11] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: can you explain to me why you need to do it that way?
[00:09:36] <Cork> your code should result in the same result, but with more work for the browser
[00:09:45] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: to update my skills to "Master Level"... to be like you.
[00:09:54] <maloik> Cork: the issue is that an autocomplete plugin doesnt let you create new tags in this form unless when you use tab or remove focus from the element, because using enter submits the form. Do you see any other way around this ?
[00:11:05] <maloik> actually, Cork , it seems the focusin eventhandler should do the trick... any idea how I can remove the submitting of the form?
[00:11:05] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/3/
[00:12:14] <Cork> maloik: i THINK you can bind a on keypress event on the input element
[00:12:29] <Cork> and prevent the submition by doing preventPropagation()
[00:12:37] <Cork> uh
[00:12:41] <Cork> sorry stopPropagation()
[00:13:06] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ahhhhhhhhhh..... what a round-about way of converting a DOM into HTML. There really should be a built-in jQuery function for that.
[00:13:18] <Cork> maloik: but i have a vague memory that some browser (prob ie) broke with that
[00:13:34] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: no, cause you shouldn't do it that way
[00:14:08] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: the reason it needs to be round about is cause browsers doesn't provide a way to get the html for the current dom element
[00:14:18] <Cork> so you need to add it to another one to get its inner html
[00:14:32] <maloik> Cork: I'll look that up, thank you. IE shouldnt be a problem, it's an internal tool :-)
[00:16:35] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: Anyway, there is obviously a need for it. jQuery should have that function.
[00:17:05] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: Now I AM at Master Level. Mu hA hA hA
[00:17:06] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: theres a small plugin for it, and ruby_on_rails gaive it to you before
[00:17:18] <Mohsen_Hassani> While assigning values to an array I get this error: unterminated string literal
[00:17:40] <Cork> so you have a string with out an end tag
[00:17:40] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: no you gave it to me first.
[00:17:55] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: i gave the code, he gave the link
[00:18:48] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: so you have a string with out an end tag <-- that was for you
[00:19:11] <Cork> ?eval "this is an unterminated string
[00:19:13] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[00:19:18] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: Thank You .
[00:19:41] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: np
[00:20:08] <Mohsen_Hassani> Cork, What end tag? I don't get it! I read the records from db, and in a for loop I want to populate my arr.
[00:20:36] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: either your echoing data from your database into js arrays
[00:20:50] <Cork> and it contains a string quote character
[00:21:04] <Cork> ?eval 'this is a string that shouldn't work *opps'
[00:21:06] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[00:21:39] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: or you have simply missed an end quote somewhere
[00:22:46] <maloik> Cork: playing around with this... doesn't work obviously :P Any help? http://jsfiddle.net/DHZNv/85/
[00:23:07] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: One reason to do it that way is I had to add two buttons after clicking the first button.
[00:23:35] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: your way is fine for changing existing button.
[00:23:45] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: so add the second button after
[00:24:07] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: second button also has src
[00:24:26] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: thats why i need to capture the image tag
[00:24:36] <Cork> not really, but what ever
[00:24:39] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: and covert it to HTML
[00:25:27] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: show me how you would add two buttons, http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/3/
[00:29:11] <Cork> maloik: http://jsfiddle.net/DHZNv/86/
[00:30:30] <maloik> thanks Cork, let me play around with that :-)
[00:30:46] <maloik> btw, why the triple = ?
[00:31:09] <MimiEA> i'm learning to write a plugin and wondering how to get inside the plughin the exact element on which the plugin has been called (does it even make sense to do that ?)
[00:31:11] <Cork> it doens't do type convertion
[00:31:11] <jonkersjoe> hey can someone recomend a color picker widget that allows transparent (or no color) ?
[00:31:27] <Cork> maloik: so its what you should normally use, unless you need its convertion
[00:31:33] <Cork> ?eval '11' == 11
[00:31:34] <bot-t> Cork: true
[00:31:36] <Cork> ?eval '11' === 11
[00:31:37] <bot-t> Cork: false
[00:32:12] <Cork> MimiEA: jquery plugin or jquery-ui plugin?
[00:32:25] <Cork> *?
[00:32:34] <MimiEA> jquery plugin
[00:32:46] <Cork> this is the matched elements
[00:33:00] <Cork> so this.each(function() {}); will loop over them
[00:34:18] <MimiEA> so when i do $('div#mydiv').myplug() , the this.each iterate over each mydiv element ?
[00:34:29] <Cork> yes
[00:34:44] <Cork> well that selector doesn't make sense, but ya
[00:34:56] <Cork> #mydiv can only exist once
[00:35:26] <MimiEA> Oh true that's a id...
[00:36:04] <MimiEA> ok so the this apply to the current selector then ?
[00:36:10] <Cork> yes
[00:36:30] <Cork> this is what you get from $('my selector')
[00:36:38] <Cork> it works the same way
[00:36:51] <Cork> this.addClass('some-class')
[00:38:33] <MimiEA> ok that make sense, now im just confused  the return this.each (
[00:38:40] <MimiEA> *by
[00:39:04] <NodeX> each can be confusing
[00:39:12] <NodeX> as there is 2 versions of it!
[00:39:27] <MimiEA> Oh ?
[00:39:44] <NodeX> or 2 ways to apply it I should say
[00:40:04] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[00:40:13] <NodeX> read the first line of the explination
[00:40:35] <Cork> MimiEA: return this.each(); is the same as this.each(); return this;
[00:40:53] <Cork> MimiEA: each return the same object it got sent to it
[00:41:32] <maloik> Cork: preventing the submit seems to work now, but I'd like to undo the preventDefault upon unfocusing the input field... is that even possible the way it's implemented now ?
[00:42:04] <Cork> maloik: why?
[00:42:19] <Cork> you won't get keypress action in the input field unless its focused
[00:42:36] <MimiEA> Ok I get it now , thanks Cork & NodeX
[00:42:50] <maloik> Cork: that doesn't seem to be the case... let me jsfiddle you my code
[00:45:03] <maloik> Cork: it just occurred to me that none of the elements had focus, so I just had to refocus one of my form elements to make it work again
[00:45:08] <maloik> works like a charm now
[00:45:18] <Cork> :)
[00:50:42] <phr> guys i need some assistance. i dont know what i did, but before i did it, it worked perfectly ;) the problem i'm facing is that i can submit the form data by pressing enter, but it does the job by clicking on the button. what did i missed? thank you.
[00:50:45] <phr> http://pastebin.com/W787sAJk
[00:52:29] <NodeX> eh?
[00:52:50] <phr> ugh, my bad, sorry. 1st coffee.
[00:52:58] <Barthje> hoi markkes
[00:53:03] <phr> i cant submit data by pressing enter, by clicking on the button works
[00:53:04] <NodeX> what do or dont you want to happen
[00:54:52] <NodeX> "#content #sub_cont" <--- unneeded
[00:54:59] <NodeX> #sub_cont will do
[00:57:09] <phr> NodeX thanks but that doesnt really fix my issue
[00:57:54] <Cork> phr: the html would help
[00:58:08] <Cork> phr: is this in a form or?
[00:58:16] <NodeX> ^^
[00:58:19] <phr> ;)
[00:58:28] <phr> okay, i'll do a more pastebin jobs
[00:58:31] <phr> hold on a sec.
[00:59:08] <Cork> (and what the different selectors match is kinda vital :) )
[01:00:23] <phr> http://pastebin.com/cn0Yg17u html part, php part http://pastebin.com/QVShR7vm
[01:01:52] <Cork> phr: ok. i would make keyup trigger submit on the form, and then put all logic in it
[01:01:57] <Cork> (in the submit handler)
[01:02:09] <Cork> that way you don't have to duplicate the code
[01:02:26] <Cork> uh.. wait your checking for 13
[01:02:36] <Cork> so your only interested in enter
[01:02:45] <Cork> uh... thats handled by default by submit
[01:02:46] <phr> true
[01:02:55] <phr> really? but it doesnt work..
[01:03:01] <Cork> so replace it all with a submit handler for the form and your done
[01:03:07] <phr> i got an error with php, which i dont have when submitting on click
[01:03:20] <Cork> whats the error?
[01:03:34] <phr> Warning: mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in C:\Ampps\www\greendot\search.php on line 66
[01:03:45] <phr> that's the $total = mysql_num_rows($rsd); line..
[01:03:53] <Cork> phr: whats the params you get from the form?
[01:04:11] <Cork> ah wait
[01:04:19] <phr> hm.. what params?
[01:04:27] <Cork> are you doing event.preventDefault() in your submit handler=
[01:04:29] <Cork> *?
[01:04:39] <Cork> phr: $_GET in php
[01:04:42] <phr> no
[01:05:01] <phr> the js i've got is the only one
[01:05:02] <Cork> phr: if you don't the form will submit as a normal http form submit
[01:06:07] <phr> the funny thing is that it worked like expected before and i cant remember to change anything.
[01:06:26] <phr> it's funny because onclick it does the job and when pressing enter the php returns that error
[01:07:34] <phr> i've tried to use id of the form
[01:07:41] <phr> still got the same cute warning ;\
[01:09:27] <Cork> phr: something like http://jsfiddle.net/BnRXz/
[01:09:43] <Cork> btw check your html it looks like its broken
[01:09:56] <Whirl3d> how can I enclose a function that will wait until a value is needed to calculate its results. In other words, if I want to return the height of an element as either 0 or it's original height I would like to be able to use something $("elem").animate({height:togglefunc}, 300); and    togglefunc wouldn't be evaluated until it was necessary
[01:10:35] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can't
[01:10:50] <Cork> animate expects height to be a value not a function
[01:11:03] <Cork> you could use the step callback though
[01:11:44] <phr> Cork tried. same result..
[01:12:45] <Cork> opps the selector should be a class
[01:13:21] <Cork> phr: $('.searchBtn').click(function() { $('#searchie').submit(); });
[01:13:57] <Cork> phr: i would recomend to convert that to a button or input type="submit" and move it into the form
[01:14:11] <Cork> then that line wouldn't be needed
[01:14:32] <Whirl3d> See my problem with animate is like this:   If I call animate on an element to animate it's opacity to 1 and it's already 1...just skip the animation call. If I call animate to opacity 1 over 10 seconds, and it's already at .8, don't take another 10 seconds to increase .2.
[01:15:26] <NodeX> Whirl3d : you'll have to work out that logic outside the animate() function and pass the params into it
[01:15:44] <Whirl3d> and if I call animate and pass the opacity property with a "toggle" value, precalculate the correct value and animate it.
[01:15:51] <phr> Cork i can understand that, but that button works perfectly :) i need to fix the enter submit.. they both worked before.. :/
[01:15:53] <Cork> Whirl3d: so you want to change the animation time depending on its current opacity, more then the value in the animation
[01:16:23] <Cork> phr: well it works, but you get problems that you don't get if you do it the other way
[01:16:54] <Whirl3d> I want it both ways. LOL I am working on my own version of animate that handles both
[01:17:05] <Cork> uh...
[01:17:18] <phr> i'm pretty confused about this issue lol:) why do i have errors now? does php parse the submit in another way or something?
[01:17:22] <Cork> Whirl3d: that sounds like you over complicates it
[01:17:33] <phr> because data gets posted by pressing enter
[01:17:55] <Cork> phr: stop look at it like its one thing that fails
[01:18:07] <Cork> phr: check that the data sent to the php script is whats expected
[01:18:15] <Cork> if its not look for why its not
[01:18:22] <Whirl3d> for example, if you are trying to animate opacity and the element has display"none" then my animate fixes it. Booolean properties are evaluated and toggled on complete of the animation cycle as well.
[01:18:23] <amirite> how do i animate background-color
[01:18:44] <rethus> i need 2 select-fields, and a drag n drop functionality between those both.. which plugin would you recommend?
[01:18:45] <Cork> amirite: jquery-ui or another plugin that lets you animate colors
[01:18:53] <amirite> how do i do it with jquery-ui
[01:19:06] <Cork> amirite: it extends native animations
[01:19:44] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[01:19:50] <amirite> keen
[01:20:46] <Whirl3d> Cork, how about this then. How are libraries built for things like color names....$("element").css("color", "red") works because red is evaluated and the value defined for red is substituted. How do I setup something similar but using "customRed" and my own color value?
[01:21:29] <Cork> Whirl3d: when you set ex. "red" the browser parses it for you
[01:21:38] <Cork> so you get the rgb values back
[01:22:26] <Whirl3d> But using jquery, you can set up CorksHotRed and use it like $("elem").css("color", "CorksHotRed");
[01:22:29] <Cork> Whirl3d: so you would have to add to the custom filters in jquery
[01:22:58] <Whirl3d> right, that's what I am trying to figure out how to effectively code something like that
[01:23:01] <Cork> Whirl3d: ya, theres hooks you can use in jquery
[01:23:09] <Cork> Whirl3d: and thats step
[01:23:23] <Cork> its called for each iteration over the animation
[01:23:32] <Cork> from there you can do what ever you like
[01:23:54] <Whirl3d> for example, I want to align by "topThird" for example, so a method that would allow me to use $(elem).css("top", "topThird");  would be the same thing
[01:24:53] <Whirl3d> I'm familiar with step, and I have no problem wrapping the entire animate method in my own sugar, but what is the best way to keep track of familiar value lables in a plugin or script?
[01:26:28] <Whirl3d> Easing is the best example.
[01:26:41] <Whirl3d> I knew there was an example on the tip of my tongue
[01:27:17] <Whirl3d> rather than posting the easing formula for "easeInOutBack", I can use the name of the formula and it gets evaluated as needed. How do I set something up like that
[01:30:16] <LuisLeite> Good morning
[01:30:37] <LuisLeite> there is any reason that Jquery causes the destroy of sessions?
[01:30:47] <Whirl3d> cause logic seems to indicate that if I can pass a function or a string to the "easing" property for animate, I should be able to write a wrapper that would allow you to define any property that could then be evaluated as needed. So $("elem").animate({top:"horizon", left:"bigBlocks"}, {easing:"easeOutBack", duration:"fast"});
[01:31:22] <Whirl3d> the "fast" and "slow" duration times are more examples.
[01:32:08] <Whirl3d> LuisLeite, I'm afraid that I don't understand your question.
[01:34:22] <LuisLeite> i'm using jquery & jqueryui ( modal form ) to add info by post into the database but when i try to add, the session its destroyed
[01:36:45] <farid> hi there
[01:37:03] <Nobita> Hi,
[01:37:17] <farid> I am trying to dynamicaly generate a list of checkboxes based on the selection made in a drp down.
[01:37:27] <farid> and the list of check box will come from database
[01:37:37] <farid> any suggestions
[01:37:53] <Whirl3d> .chosen.js ?
[01:38:24] <farid> yea forgo to mention i am new with jquery
[01:39:21] <Whirl3d> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[01:39:27] <Nobita> Hi, is there any option with which we can override the importing jQuery such as !important of CSS, for an instance I need jQuery 1.4.4 for my image slider but my site is importing 1.3.2 due to dynamic behavior of our custom framework; so I'm not getting the o/p of my slider as expected, any suggestions how can we achieve this?
[01:46:30] <pandu101> hey guys I got this form that has a keyup trigger. It works except when a user backspaces and deletes everything. In that case, the form still makes an ajax call and submits 'data'. OF course this fails. How can I validate for when a user has erased data from the field?
[01:47:04] <coldhead> Nobita: if you load a new jQuery it will replace the existing one
[01:47:08] <coldhead> and probably screw things up
[01:47:13] <coldhead> but worth a shot
[01:47:33] <Cork> pandu101: check the field length?
[01:47:44] <coldhead> Nobita: you may also find this illuminating http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[01:47:55] <coldhead> here the other library is "an older version of jQuery"
[01:47:55] <Cork> if its empty you can safely ignore it
[01:47:58] <pandu101> Cork: of course. haha. I should have thought about that! Thanks.
[01:48:19] <Nobita> Thanks coldhead :-) let me try your above solutions!

[01:59:08] <minna> shoky: Ah, so i have to split it with 1000.
[01:59:24] <minna> shoky: So that's why it never fit when i tested to convert the other way around.
[01:59:33] <minna> shoky: Thanks a million, i was getting crazy!
[01:59:55] <minna> shoky: Do you know if this works between contries, or only US standard?
[02:00:04] <shoky> np.. but, google would get you the answer in a second
[02:00:24] <minna> shoky: I think i googled to complex

[02:00:38] <minna> shoky: I got stuck on this one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/206790/best-javascript-date-parser-formatter
[02:00:57] <shoky> minna: that page doesn't even have the word unix
[02:01:13] <coldhead> Nobita: that comes with a free bug -- if you ever upgrade the main jQuery on the page to 1.7.2 my code won't run >: |
[02:01:17] <eroll> hi, anyone uses  jquery ajax request embed in qtip tooltip with jsonp ?
[02:01:55] <minna> shoky: Right, because i thought i needed to convert the time stamp from 3 and jul to 03 and 07 first.
[02:03:33] <coldhead> that sounds very complicated, eroll :(
[02:03:53] <eroll> it doesn't seem : ) it is !
[02:04:25] <shoky> are you saying it seems easy
[02:04:45] <coldhead> he's saying it doesn't just SEEM complicated, it IS complicated
[02:04:49] <coldhead> in the platonic sense
[02:04:50] <eroll> no it' pretty hard, many embed lib together ...
[02:05:19] <shoky> i know, just being lame
[02:05:21] <coldhead> there is a direct identity between this problem and the platonic ideal of complexity
[02:06:15] <cusco> .autocompleate feature that adds/removes results to/from a <ul> list ??

[02:07:27] <beasty> hi minna
[02:07:29] <shoky> what bout his simplicity
[02:07:42] <cusco> coldhead: will look into that.. another question tho
[02:07:56] <coldhead> wait, let me cover myself in vegetable oil first
[02:08:19] <shoky> $_$
[02:08:19] <cusco> the list is a different page called with ajax and innerHTML
[02:08:30] <cusco> I cannot have the jquery script there, can I?
[02:08:42] <cusco> how do I pass the source argument to autocomplete?
[02:09:35] <coldhead> oh god i have vegetable oil in my eyes

[02:10:09] <hemangpatel> is there any way to create minify js through terminal ?
[02:10:47] <shoky> hemangpatel: i blv so
[02:11:10] <coldhead> hemangpatel: this kind of thing, using NodeJS https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/
[02:11:16] <coldhead> there are others
[02:11:54] <coldhead> cusco: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-source
[02:11:58] <Cork> hemangpatel: the ones i know about depends on java :S
[02:12:11] <cusco> coldhead: im on that page
[02:12:16] <Cork> theres some for ruby too i think
[02:12:25] <coldhead> this one uses common lisp! https://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js
[02:12:27] <coldhead> so many options
[02:12:56] <hemangpatel> thanks to all.
[02:13:14] <Cork> hemangpatel: but try google, i bet it will give you quite a list
[02:14:04] <hemangpatel> Cork : ok
[02:14:19] <coldhead> or just ask someone here to use google for you
[02:15:16] <Cork> coldhead: you mean like http://lmgtfy.com/?q=terminal+minify+js ? :D

[02:28:26] <bokgroll> maybe closeText... but that's not text
[02:28:31] <bokgroll> hrm
[02:28:41] <Cork> opps, that was from me extending it ;P
[02:28:47] <coldhead> i would just hide it in CSS

[02:39:00] <Cork> uh...
[02:39:07] <nFFF> shouldnt it be .prop for src?
[02:39:10] <Cork> well that looks like it does something at least >_>
[02:39:22] <Cork> nFFF: depends on what you want
[02:40:20] <nFFF> well either to retrieve or set
[02:40:28] <nFFF> src is a property not an attribute, or?
[02:40:32] <Cork> well both works
[02:40:41] <Cork> src is both
[02:40:57] <Cork> everything that you can set from html has an attr
[02:41:21] <coldhead> Hopsy: mijn hovercraft zit vol palingen
[02:41:25] <nFFF> I just read somewhere that its best practise to use .prop for most things
[02:41:33] <Cork> it is
[02:41:35] <nFFF> But I dont remember where or why
[02:41:46] <Hopsy> wtf lool! :D
[02:41:48] <Cork> but prop won't always give you want you expect
[02:42:09] <Cork> on the other hand, same is true for attr
[02:42:21] <Hopsy> coldhead: 'cus why are you in an hovercraft again?

[02:51:37] <Hopsy> it's the longest word in my dictionary
[02:52:02] <aquatix> Hopsy: i hate it that spelling checkers don't comprehend that Dutch words can be combined
[02:52:14] <aquatix> so they try to correct by splitting them up with spaces
[02:52:20] <aquatix> -> spatieziekte

[02:56:22] <coldhead> now to learn how to SAY these things
[02:59:36] <kosko> every 10 seconds ajax file is called, on the page where this ajax is called i have and image #image and i want to change this image, if i return something like this from within my ajax file <script>$("#image").attr("src",\'/image2.png\');</script>
[02:59:55] <kosko> is that a good way
[02:59:58] <kosko> will it work?
[03:00:29] <Cork> depends on what you do with that response
[03:00:45] <Cork> i would prob just send the url and do the other work statically on the js side

[03:16:49] <jankees> And I want to change the fadeIn() behavior on those browsers
[03:16:59] <jankees> can anyone give me a hint on how i would do that?
[03:17:30] <Hopsy> jankees: just use it?
[03:17:30] <jankees> basically i want to skip the opacity thing on < IE9
[03:17:41] <jankees> what do you mean?

[03:17:56] <Hopsy> bot-t: if IE lte

[03:59:17] <cusco> I tried on open: console.log(ui); return false;
[03:59:29] <cusco> it logs the object, but the box still opens
[04:00:13] <systemfault> o_O Why would you use autocompleteâ€¦ at all then?
[04:00:18] <cusco> right...
[04:00:25] <cusco> I was thinking that
[04:00:56] <systemfault> Just XHR the file and use it :)
[04:03:12] <cusco> right I can do that..
[04:03:17] <cusco> my objective tho
[04:03:29] <cusco> is to reorganize <li> elements in a ul, according to the result
[04:03:48] <cusco> I initially thought I could manipulate autocomplete <li> elements
[04:04:14] <systemfault> jQueryUI is okayâ€¦ as long as you take it "as it is".
[04:04:44] <cusco> thats cool advise
[04:04:45] <systemfault> In your case, you're better off just $.ajax'ing the file and iterate on the array
[04:05:32] <cusco> yes that is what I'm doing now :)
[04:21:59] <dipser> where is jsfiddle? :(
[04:22:49] <xec> it's in the cloooud (tm)
[04:23:08] <xec> or, more specifically, jsfiddle.net
[04:24:00] <CalvinMcGee> http://jsfiddle.net/y7ePL/
[04:24:17] <bjensen> what do you guys use to make selects more user friendly? Ive been looking at https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/
[04:24:29] <fuchstronaut> I once made a cloud in an elevator, people around me where disgusted. But when google does it world wide it is ok... life is just not fair :-(
[04:24:29] <CalvinMcGee> I need help with this one, http://jsfiddle.net/y7ePL/. I get that options is undefined, but can't see why.
[04:27:07] <xec> fuchstronaut: well, there's a lot more fresh air world wide than in an elevator
[04:27:58] <fuchstronaut> that's prolly why
[04:28:13] <xec> especially post-cloud
[04:29:57] <Whirl3d> that must be what they mean when it says, "you've stunk up 20% of your available space"....I wondered
[04:30:24] <Whirl3d> or is that just my gmail that says that?
[04:30:27] <xec> CalvinMcGee: it appears the _initVariables() method is called without any arguments (which is where you expect the options to come from?)
[04:31:43] <CalvinMcGee> xec: methods.init is called with argument options and from there I call _initVariables with argument options
[04:31:50] <sendoushi> Hey guys i'm wondering around here. What are your hour and day rates to develop html / css + javascript? trying to find my own rates.
[04:31:53] <xec> CalvinMcGee: this is a whole lot of code to dig through though. do you know how to use the debugger?
[04:32:20] <xec> CalvinMcGee: check out your calculate:
[04:32:36] <xec> CalvinMcGee: the line right after it is: methods._initVariables();

[04:36:08] <StephenS> I have problem with ajax search
[04:36:28] <StephenS> I run query which is SELECT * FROM `table` LIKE user = '%test%'
[04:36:51] <StephenS> however in instant search ajax, I don't get possible results, only if I write final result, I get showed off username.
[04:39:19] <Cork> StephenS: whats the question?
[04:41:59] <StephenS> Cork: How can I make instant search with result
[04:42:08] <fusion27> I got a JSON pull coming back looking like this.  http://pastie.org/4231172  I want to extract (move in to their own object or array) all objects where "subject": "1500" how would you do that?
[04:42:13] <StephenS> lets say I have admin123 in db, and I search with ajax, for admin, I will not get any result..
[04:42:18] <StephenS> even though I use properly query
[04:42:43] <Cork> StephenS: your kinda asking in the wrong channel as its an sql question
[04:42:45] <DeltaHeavy> StephenS: Are you searching for admin or admin123?
[04:42:48] <Cork> but you want like not =
[04:43:01] <fusion27> .filter()?
[04:43:10] <Cork> SELECT * FROM `table` LIKE user like '%<search query>%'
[04:43:11] <DeltaHeavy> Stephens: Pastebin your PHP and JS and link it to me
[04:43:37] <Cork> uh.. wait
[04:43:43] <shokky> s/LIKE/WHERE/
[04:43:43] <Cork> like like??
[04:43:44] <xec> is'nt it WHERE user LIKE ....
[04:43:50] <Cork> it is
[04:43:52] <xec> right
[04:43:53] <xec> :)
[04:44:00] <xec> isn't*
[04:44:03] <Cork> didn't notice it was there instead of where before
[04:44:26] <fusion27> SELECT * FROM table WHERE user like '%admin%'
[04:44:40] <StephenS> Cork thatsd correct
[04:44:42] <StephenS> I use that query
[04:44:59] <Cork> StephenS: your using that query or the one you posted before?
[04:45:09] <Cork> cause the one you posted is broken
[04:45:14] <StephenS> lmao
[04:45:15] <StephenS> my bad
[04:45:20] <shokky> fusion27: $.grep()
[04:45:21] <StephenS> It seems like my previous script was not saved
[04:45:27] <StephenS> I was using user equal $var
[04:45:35] <adfsafds> hello i don't know if that is CSS problem or jquery. I install a jquery slideshow but it has got some problems with chrome...
[04:45:37] <adfsafds> here is the site
[04:45:37] <fusion27> tx shokky
[04:45:51] <adfsafds> can i paste the site?
[04:45:57] <Cork> StephenS: i HOPE!!! your escaping your variable before you out it in your query right?
[04:46:43] <Cork> (me searches in StephenS's auto complete for "'; drop table;")
[04:47:11] <StephenS> foreach ($_GET as $key => $value) {
[04:47:12] <StephenS> 	    $_GET[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string($value);
[04:47:12] <StephenS> 	}
[04:47:14] <StephenS> Should protect me :)
[04:47:19] <Cork> good
[04:47:31] <Whirl3d> after defining a Deferred object, is there an easy way to ensure that some callback is executed once all the other resolve or reject callbacks have fired. Does $.Deferred.always work for that?
[04:47:36] <StephenS> I have the same for $_POST too :)
[04:47:49] <Cork> StephenS: just use $_REQUEST
[04:47:52] <StephenS> Cant be bored to add on every single $_POST mysql_real..
[04:47:54] <Cork> it catches both
[04:47:56] <StephenS> nah, I prefer get and post
[04:48:02] <NodeX> StephenS : that will not protect you against everything
[04:48:12] <StephenS> You mean from XSS?
[04:48:13] <StephenS> I know
[04:48:34] <Whirl3d> can you .when(deferred).always(dosomething)?
[04:48:51] <Cork> Whirl3d: check the code
[04:49:00] <Cork> when in doubt read the code :)
[04:49:17] <Whirl3d> I was hoping someone knew off hand...I'll find out and report back.
[04:51:23] <StephenS> NodeX, xss right? any ideas?
[04:51:44] <NodeX> lots but this is #jquery not #security
[04:56:16] <gf3> Make apps, not errors. <3 #jquerri
[04:56:16] <Whirl3d> Well that was certainly easy enough. I knew there was a reason that I didn't spend too much time "reading the code"....so, when in doubt, make it yourself and fix it later...
[04:56:18] <Whirl3d> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.Deferred
[05:00:40] <Whirl3d> maybe I didn't ask the right question....is it a problem that all of these "promises" and "deferreds" are floating around without being cleaned up? I keep thinking that if I attach a promise to jquery object using the $.Deferred().promise(obj)  method, that I need to get rid of the promise once the thing is resolved of rejected...
[05:03:47] <maloik> I'm using the daterangepicker from filament group, but getting this error on pages where theres no daterangepicker present: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of null
[05:04:09] <maloik> but this doesnt make sense to me, shouldnt it only load the daterangepicker() function on that object if its present in the first place ?
[05:04:59] <Sebbdk> @Whirl3d not sure if code or poetry but it was interesting reading
[05:06:37] <Whirl3d> I love james padolsey's source viewer, but there's a reason that I use jquery---it's to leverage the genius of those people who made it to begin with. If I could do it myself, it would likely be whirledQuery or something much less poetic or useful.

[05:13:58] <varnie> Hi there.
[05:14:20] <varnie> what does the following handler do? "$('#fRate').bind('submit', function (obj, go) { ... });"
[05:14:34] <varnie> its second argument confuses me
[05:19:44] <xec> varnie: yes that does look a bit odd. the first arg is the event object, but i didn't think there was a second one. what do you get if you console.log() it=

[05:38:59] <dipser> Grundell: remove()
[05:40:06] <Grundell> dipser yeah remove, the thing is that i wrote $('hr').revmove(); didnt't get it to work assume i do something wrog?
[05:40:09] <Grundell> wrong*
[05:40:32] <dipser> revmove or remove?

[05:42:00] <Nece228> hello
[05:42:04] <Nece228> why this doesnt work:
[05:42:36] <Nece228> $('table').replaceWith('hahah').prepend('asdf')?
[05:42:44] <Nece228> i mean the prepend part doesnt work
[05:42:58] <Nece228> however if i do append instead of replaceWith it works
[05:43:45] <catchvibhor> can i close a opened tab from jquery ( or js) i have tried using windows.close() but it dosn't work
[05:44:22] <varnie> xec, here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Tc2f4/4/
[05:44:30] <varnie> it says 'undefined' when the form is submitted
[05:45:56] <varnie> it is okay, but how can we utilize that parameter?
[05:45:59] <xec> varnie: well, there you go. there is no second argument :)
[05:46:09] <varnie> for example, pass it
[05:46:18] <xec> what do you mean
[05:46:31] <varnie> is it possible to pass that "go" parameter to that handler?
[05:46:43] <xec> what would "go" be, exactly?
[05:46:49] <varnie> no ideas :)
[05:47:10] <varnie> it is the code from my colleague, and I wondered whether it is correct or not.
[05:47:50] <varnie> somehow he tried to use that "go" for preventing form from being submited twice if I understand it correctly.
[05:50:53] <varnie> I am waiting for his explanations though.
[05:51:26] <xec> varnie: 10 bucks says he doesn't know what he's doing :D
[05:51:30] <dipser> http://jsfiddle.net/Tc2f4/6/
[05:53:02] <varnie> hehe
[06:05:18] <fusion27> what would you guys use to get stuff from this array, my getter feels verbose http://pastie.org/4231523
[06:06:31] <dipser> is this possible? $(arrDepts)
[06:08:02] <mindtheory> hey everyone.. what does this last line do? http://pastie.org/4231544 looks almost like a conditional with the &&, but has no if statement
[06:08:52] <ajpiano> mindtheory: using && works like an if statement
[06:08:55] <ajpiano> essentially
[06:09:04] <ajpiano> but some people consider it poor/unredable coding style
[06:09:30] <ajpiano> when you start to have like 3 conditions like that before the actual thing it gets a little uggerz
[06:09:43] <mindtheory> ajpiano: so it will do the commands from left to right as long as each previous one is true?
[06:09:47] <ajpiano> yep
[06:09:51] <dipser> fusion27: http://jsfiddle.net/S5DtQ/
[06:09:52] <mindtheory> ahhh thanks ;)
[06:10:20] <xec> i'm a bit fuzzy on the comma after removeClass() - what sort of syntax is that?
[06:10:37] <mindtheory> makes sense, appreciate it.. it can be handy eh, but definitely harder to read sometimes
[06:10:40] <fusion27> yea, disper I was thinking about doing the getter as a .filter()
[06:11:14] <dipser> fusion27: tried it, it works too. didnt know that
[06:11:25] <mindtheory> xec: did you mean from the link i posted? I'm confused about that part too
[06:11:27] <fusion27> doesn't it seem verbose?
[06:11:52] <Whirl3d> fusion27, maybe something like this?http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g6Qpa/
[06:12:10] <xec> mindtheory: indeed
[06:12:28] <fusion27> Whirl3d: that's nice!!
[06:16:32] <Whirl3d> fusion27, that way you only have to do the work once...from then on it's just accessing a property of the depts object.
[06:17:29] <fusion27> Whirl3d: what about this http://jsfiddle.net/nfK9q/
[06:20:04] <Whirl3d> if it works for you it works. I think that your fiddle has to search the array every time with a new filter or params passed to the filter....I dunno. deptsObj[7520] seems as straightforward as you can get)
[06:20:51] <companion_> hi
[06:21:30] <Whirl3d> you could iterate the array with $.each(), but I read somewhere that there was a tiny increase in speed for simple arrays using while (c--) over any other iteration methods
[06:22:07] <Whirl3d> so it stuck---but whatever works for you is what's important
[06:23:20] <Hopsy> aquatix: did you finnished your lunch?
[06:25:41] <jiu> guys anyone knows how to pass by argument colModel to a jqgrid function
[06:30:47] <mister_m> if I create an image element with document.createElement(...) - can I create a jquery object with the var I put it in and then add a click handler? like: var img = ...;   then $(img).Click(...)?
[06:31:54] <mister_m> when I try the above I get a type error saying that [object Object] has no method click
[06:33:10] <jiu> where can i paste my code so you can see it ?
[06:37:34] <aquatix> Hopsy: ah, for hours yet :)
[06:39:42] <Whirl3d> mister_m, the way jquery works is it wraps itself around a dom element and gives you access to a whole bunch more methods. if you want to create an image and want to manipulate it with jquery, just wrap the dom element in jquery like var image=new Image(); var img=$(image);   so, the jquery click method will work for img.click() but won't for image.click
[06:46:22] <jiu> guys how can i implement getColModel in jqgrid ?
[06:48:35] <anli_> What the best, 94,084 MSEK or 94.084 MSEK?
[06:48:40] <anli_> :)
[07:03:06] <negev> hi, if i use a jquery selector to select a dom input, eg $('input[name="foo"]').function(e) {   inside the function i can get the object with $(this).  is there a way to extend the object so that whenever i do this i have extra methods available to $(this).  ?
[07:04:13] <diverdude> negev: $.extend
[07:05:06] <negev> yeah i looked at that, couldn't see exactly how to use it with dom objects though
[07:05:25] <cusco> hi
[07:05:29] <negev> i want to do the extending once, and then be able to use selectors as normal but have extra methods available
[07:06:42] <cusco> using .ajax() on sucess I get the returned data.. now I want to populate a ul with <li> that comes from data.. should I return <li>item</li>\n directly from the .ajax target or use json and whatever to use element-ul.html() ?
[07:09:25] <cusco> invalid left hand side?
[07:10:43] <negev_> git dropped, sorry
[07:10:46] <negev_> *got
[07:11:47] <companion_> are developers ever going to unionize?
[07:11:57] <eternalsword> cusco if you already have html, use that as it will be faster than having to process json.  not sure I really understood your question.
[07:13:01] <cusco> I was trying to avoid having them as html. but ok
[07:13:03] <cusco> so...
[07:13:28] <cusco> do I use $("#myULid").html() = msg; ?
[07:13:34] <eternalsword> negev, to do that, you would have to extend jquery.  look at writing jquery plugins.
[07:14:20] <eternalsword> cusco, it would be $("#myULid").html(msg);
[07:14:38] <cusco> ah !
[07:15:02] <negev> thanks
[07:15:42] <cusco> now.. can I somehow remove every element of a single class?
[07:17:21] <cusco> .remove
[07:17:44] <eternalsword> cusco, $('.someclass').remove();  you may want to do a $('.someclass').slideUp('fast', function() { $(this).remove(); }); to make it less jumpy.
[07:17:58] <cusco> nice !
[07:18:00] <cusco> thanks
[07:18:05] <eternalsword> you really should take a look at the documentation if your are able as those are basics.
[07:18:16] <cusco> hehe
[07:18:27] <cusco> im fiddling with jquery for the first times..
[07:18:36] <cusco> I do good with plain js
[07:18:49] <cusco> Im finding functions for everything, amazing
[07:18:50] <cusco> :)
[07:20:29] <Sebbdk> yeah, even those that are missing usually have plugins for it, be sure to take a look at the jQuery-UI examples if you have not already :)
[07:21:40] <eternalsword> cusco, don't lose track of your plain js roots.  If you can do it consistently across browsers with plain js, it will be faster.  actually $(document.getElementById('someid')); is faster than $('#someid'); because it doesn't have to parse anything.
[07:22:53] <cusco> ow
[07:22:59] <cusco> that is good to know
[07:24:15] <eternalsword> always target an id first, then a subset if you are able $(document.getElementById('someid')).find('.someclass')... is faster than $('.someclass')... etc
[07:24:39] <cusco> ok, i'm taking notes
[07:25:06] <Sebbdk> please dont use $(document.getElementById('someid')), it's very insensitive to the eye ^^Â´  and the performance hit is rarely an issue
[07:25:13] <cusco> I too, tend to optimize when external elements (time, money, etc) allow it
[07:25:38] <freazy> 	Hi, do anyone know a tutorial for a mouse controlled slider like here http://www.flowslider.com/example.html ?
[07:25:56] <cusco> Sebbdk: I actually was using plugin datatables the other day and noticed that on some browsers performance may be a issue, (IE 8)
[07:26:05] <cusco> parsing DOM is slow
[07:26:05] <eternalsword> Sebbdk, to each their own.
[07:27:00] <cusco> eternalsword: if I was to get all thos <li>'s to slide down, I would have to turn them into a array, and use .each() ?
[07:27:15] <Sebbdk> @eternalsword, @cusco i agree, but my concern is not personal coding style, but more that other people than you might have to read the code at some point :) and itÃ¸s a huge timesaver not having to spend to mush time desifering the code
[07:27:16] <cusco> (those I'm getting from .ajax() )
[07:27:48] <Sebbdk> *spelling when a bit madd there, hope you got the point :P
[07:27:55] <eternalsword> cusco, slide them down one at a time, yes.  It may be more appropriate to hide the ul and slideDown the ul.
[07:28:18] <eternalsword> hide the ul, insert html, slidedown ul.
[07:28:20] <cusco> Sebbdk: I guess most of us know what mess it is to look at someone else's code .. even the plainner code can make us dread on...
[07:28:59] <cusco> thing is the ul, is being used in .sortable with connectWith:
[07:29:06] <Sebbdk> cusco:  yes my point exactly , standards are important especially on a language that can be sued in so many ways as JS
[07:29:31] <cusco> ahh nvm, the ul will stay, not go away
[07:29:46] <cusco> ok ok I have stuff to try
[07:30:13] <Sebbdk> if anyone is interested, this guy has some really valid points :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY#t=34m33s
[07:30:33] <Sebbdk> in terms of readable js :)

[07:35:38] <kelye> not working on dynamically created elements

[07:35:57] <STRML> Hey everyone, I just released a simple scrolling shadows plugin, hope it's useful to somebody: http://strml.github.com/examples/jquery.scrollingShadows.html
[07:36:10] <eternalsword> kelye, use on with jquery 1.7.x
[07:36:19] <eternalsword> .on()
[07:36:39] <kelye> i have something like  $('.class a').on('click',  ...  and then i append an element a to that .class container
[07:37:02] <kelye> my on('click' is not called when i click the newly added element
[07:37:09] <ajpiano> kelye: i explained this yesterday...
[07:37:13] <eternalsword> use $('.class').on('click', 'a', ... instead
[07:37:18] <ajpiano> kelye: you need $(".class").on("click", "a", function() {})
[07:37:57] <kelye> ajpiano: sorry, didn't see that yesterday .. might have gone offline before your response :(
[07:38:13] <kelye> can you guys explain the difference?
[07:38:37] <eternalsword> prefereably, $('#someid').find('.class').on('click', 'a' ... if you can.
[07:38:41] <ajpiano> kelye: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120709.log.html#t08:43:34
[07:39:40] <ajpiano> ;)
[07:39:58] <code_ph0y> hey guys ... does someone know how you explode a string?
[07:40:05] <EyePulp> ajpiano: what's the purpose of the second argument 'a' in that .on('click', 'a'
[07:40:13] <eternalsword> kelye, less event handling. you have one for a specified element that tracks the bubbled up events looking for the selector you used, instead of having an event handler for each 'a'
[07:40:15] <code_ph0y> ooo indexOf is coming back to me :S
[07:40:18] <EyePulp> code_ph0y: baking soda and vinegar?
[07:40:24] <code_ph0y> i don't not why but
[07:40:24] <ajpiano> it's the selector to match for event delegation, EyePulp
[07:40:25] <code_ph0y> :S
[07:40:52] * EyePulp goes back to the docs
[07:40:55] <EyePulp> =)
[07:41:29] <code_ph0y> lol EyePulp ... if I can't get it to work the normal way I might try your solution
[07:42:24] <code_ph0y> ooo we have a winner .. split
[07:42:38] <kelye> hm, still now working
[07:42:43] <eternalsword> and join for implode
[07:43:03] <eternalsword> kelye, example code?
[07:43:15] <eternalsword> preferably a jsfiddle
[07:43:25] <dendan>  when I run $('script') with jquery, it returns me a list of loaded scripts. but then if I add content to a page with ajax where the new script is loaded too, then if I run $('script') it do not return that loaded script - list is still the same as before ajax request. why?
[07:44:16] <dendan> in other words, how to get a list of loaded scripts?
[07:44:52] <eternalsword> are you running the second $('script') in the ajax callback?
[07:45:06] <dendan> yes
[07:45:31] <dendan> no difference even if I run it in the console
[07:45:37] <eternalsword> additionally after the new code is injected somewhere?
[07:45:44] <dendan> yes
[07:46:08] <dendan> 1. $('script') 2. ajax 3. append. 4. $('script')
[07:46:46] <dendan> umm. instead of append() I do html(), btw
[07:47:06] <eternalsword> have you checked the element list afterwards, maybe jquery isn't injecting the script code.
[07:47:19] <stongo> can someone help me figure out a bug with indexOf ? the indexOf method is not working properly with values from an array ... http://pastebin.com/BdJASVQN
[07:47:24] <dendan> oh.. looks like script is not inserted into the dom. because jquery loads it with ajax request too.. shit
[07:48:38] <kelye> eternalsword: http://jsfiddle.net/G9tdR/
[07:49:18] <dendan> so, jquery do not insert it at all, it just call it with ajax. in this case I cant find it in the dom. wtf? what to do?
[07:50:25] <ajpiano> dendan: jquery executes the script and then removes it, why do you need to get the current collection of scripts on the page
[07:51:09] <dendan> to filter  them. so, if I load the page with ajax again, then the already loaded scripts should not be loaded
[07:51:41] <ajpiano> hate to say it but that is not a good approach to solving the problem you have :|
[07:51:59] <ajpiano> you should clean up the pages you're requesting so they don't have scripts inline
[07:55:00] <dendan> it is a framework, which adds scripts for widgets to let them work. It cant know if the script was loaded to skip the script line generation before content is send to the browser
[07:55:17] <dendan> so, what I am trying to to is the ONE available solution
[07:55:27] <dendan> to to = to do
[07:55:38] <cusco> can keyup act only after one second ?, so if I type several chars, it will only proccess them once after 1 second instead several times immediatly??
[07:55:46] <cusco> using .keyp()
[07:55:55] <timing> cusco: setTimeout
[07:56:03] <cusco> ah, right
[07:56:06] <cusco> thanks
[07:56:11] <kelye> ajpiano:  http://jsfiddle.net/G9tdR/1/ ?
[07:56:13] <timing> every time a keyup is fired you do clearTimeout
[07:56:17] <ajpiano> timing: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[07:56:24] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[07:56:31] <ajpiano> i mean cusco ^^
[07:56:37] <cusco> thanks
[07:56:38] <timing> sweet!
[07:56:43] <eternalsword> kelye, http://jsfiddle.net/G9tdR/2/
[07:57:02] <ajpiano> kelye: the things in the $("selection") have to be IN THE DOM when you call it
[07:57:07] <ajpiano> they have to contain the things you're looking for
[07:57:08] <eternalsword> kelye, the first selector must first exist
[07:57:46] <kelye> in the case of .live() it worked for newly added elements also
[07:57:58] <kelye> even if they ware not ready in the dom
[07:58:17] <ajpiano> kelye: that's because live was doing $(document).on("click", "selector", fn)
[07:58:51] <dendan> can I load script localy for the current content which is loaded with ajax?
[07:59:21] <ajpiano> dendan: that question is very unclear
[08:00:11] <eternalsword> dendan, why the need for differing scripts in the first place?
[08:01:11] <dendan> let's say I load a html with <script src="..."> inside of it. this script modify the h1 tag for example. what I need is to apply this modification for the new loaded content only.
[08:01:28] <dendan> also, there is no way to modify the script which is loading.
[08:02:37] <dendan> or just skip this script if it was already loaded before
[08:04:07] <foo> I have a js file that is being cached. Is there anyway to force the browser to not cache a particular js file. Is there any way to have the browser not cache a js file ?
[08:04:07] <david_mark> foo, you have one new message, just say â€œreadâ€ to me when you wish to read it.
[08:04:33] <farid> Hi there
[08:04:45] <foo> david_mark: read
[08:04:45] <david_mark> foo, from Krinkle, 5w 6d ago: bar
[08:04:52] <foo> Krinkle: How dare you try to bar me.
[08:05:50] <dendan> my task is not easy, right? it is not just tell to nubs how to do Traversing :)
[08:06:45] <mister_m> if I am inside of a click handler - does $(this) refer to the object that is getting a click handler assigned?
[08:06:53] <ajpiano> dendan: it makes a lot more sense to not be loading that script with the page it's supposed to modify, but rather to have that functionality in the main application, and apply it to the html after it's loaded
[08:06:56] <mister_m> or do I explicitly need to pass that element to the handler
[08:06:58] <ajpiano> mister_m: yes
[08:07:03] <ajpiano> mister_m: it's also available as event.target
[08:07:26] <torbjorn> would this be the right place to ask about jQuery Mobile?
[08:07:33] <dendan> php do not know if the script need to be loaded or not
[08:07:38] <dendan> how u will do that?
[08:07:40] <dendan> no way
[08:07:55] <ajpiano> torbjorn: #jquerymobile or here if no one replies there i guess
[08:07:57] <cusco> timing: I would have to place the whole .ajax() and whathelse inside setTimeOut(
[08:08:00] <cusco> right ?
[08:08:11] <ajpiano> cusco: i sent you a plugin that makes this task very trivial, take a look
[08:08:12] <farid> I have a set of check boxes that is generated dynamilay.i get 2 parent check boxes. now when i click one it adds another few checkboxes. when i clik the second it should appen a few more check boxes. and when i uncheck them the coresponding check boxes should disappear.. I am using load to load the first set of check boxes .. I dont have clue how to do the rest of it.
[08:08:16] <torbjorn> thanks, that was easy
[08:08:25] <cusco> ajpiano: I did look at the demo
[08:08:36] <cusco> I was just avoiding loading yet another plugin
[08:08:46] <mister_m> ajpiano: I also want to make an eventData dictionary available - how do I refer to the eventData argument of the click method?
[08:08:47] <ajpiano> lol i love the "yet another plugin" story
[08:08:58] <cusco> tho it is precisely what I'm looking for
[08:09:07] <ajpiano> it's also infinitessimally small
[08:09:13] <cusco> it never is..
[08:09:18] <cusco> ok let me try it then...
[08:09:45] <ajpiano> https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-throttle-debounce/master/jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.min.js
[08:10:01] <mister_m> I am guessing that would be event.data
[08:10:02] <ajpiano> mister_m: not sure i follow?
[08:10:12] <ajpiano> you can pass along that additional data from bind time into the handler
[08:10:18] <ajpiano> by passing extra stuff at bind time
[08:10:33] <eternalsword> dendan, that modification code should be run in the ajax callback after inserting the code.  you can use data- attributes to tell what you need to do if you must.
[08:11:15] <ajpiano> dendan: eternalsword is right.... if you insist on sticking with your existing architecture, the best thing to do would make it so that the php sends back script that is scoped using a selector to the html it's inserting
[08:11:32] <dendan> if I do $(scripts) it wil not return mew the already loaded scripts. this why I can know if I need to load it and pass param to data
[08:11:59] <dendan> I cant*
[08:11:59] <ajpiano> that's a godawful way to do the filtering you're trying to do
[08:12:02] <mister_m> ajpiano: .click( [eventData], handler(eventObject) )
[08:12:11] <ajpiano> you really shouldn't be attempting to push that burden to the client side
[08:12:24] <dendan> ok, example:
[08:12:33] <ajpiano> i get it
[08:12:37] <ajpiano> i'm just saying it's not a good idea
[08:13:50] <fredi> I have a set of check boxes that is generated dynamilay.i get 2 parent check boxes. now when i click one it adds another few checkboxes. when i clik the second it should appen a few more check boxes. and when i uncheck them the coresponding check boxes should disappear.. I am using load to load the first set of check boxes .. I dont have clue how to do the rest of it.
[08:13:57] <eternalsword> dendan, all your code should be loaded prior for anything that might happen on the page.
[08:14:18] <dendan> I have a page which can be loaded with normal way or with ajax and inserted into the dom. Let's say this page containt he script <script src="jquery.js">, when it is loaded in normal way the jquery is initialized. and then if it loaded with ajax then jquery initialized again.
[08:14:41] <lidalin>  nn
[08:14:45] <dendan> see the problem?
[08:14:50] <ajpiano> dendan: modern web application development revolves around refactoring the backend so that the ajax requests don't have the script embedded somehow
[08:14:54] <eternalsword> dendan: use a GET
[08:15:36] <ajpiano> trying to use the DOM as a dependency management system for your dynamically loaded scripts is something that just doesn't really work
[08:15:45] <dendan> I already load data with get using ajax
[08:16:23] <eternalsword> dendan: you shouldn't be loading the full page, you should be targeting part of it.
[08:16:24] <Tuttle> hi. is it possible to select subset of checkboxes? $('input[name="legal_form" && value > 0 && value <= 110').each(...)
[08:17:21] <dendan> I do not load full the page, I load just part where the <script src=""> exists
[08:17:38] <dendan> this part can be loaded as a themplate in the normal way or ajax
[08:18:07] <mister_m> the event.target in a click handler (or any handler) are NOT jquery wrapped objects, correct?
[08:18:10] <dendan> have u evere worked with php frameworks guys?
[08:19:33] <ajpiano> mister_m: correct
[08:19:36] <eternalsword> dendan: the right approach is to use php to handle what you want to return. you can use $_GET['ajax'] to determine what type.  http://www.example.com/?ajax=1 would support ajax, http://www.example.com would not.
[08:20:33] <nFFFF> Any SVG heros here?
[08:20:46] <eternalsword> dendan, that way you can tell what's loaded and not on the php side.
[08:20:52] <dendan> ok, again: page is loaded. on that page is a button which loads some ajax content. this ajax content needs script. if I click it again then the scipt is loaded again.
[08:21:20] <ajpiano> dendan: repeating the same fact over and over again will not yield a new solution
[08:21:25] <eternalsword> dendan, just load it in advance.  I feel like I'm beating a dead horse.
[08:22:00] <dendan> it is stupid to load in advance every scripts of the very big site. when I do not need it on every page
[08:22:16] <eternalsword> just load what the single page needs.
[08:22:27] <dendan> I can use calendar script just in one page of 100 pages. but u suggest to load it all the time
[08:22:31] <dendan> wrong way
[08:22:41] <eternalsword> no, just load it on the page that needs it.
[08:23:07] <eternalsword> if you have a button on a page that loads a calendar, include what's needed prior, but you don't need that on all your pages.
[08:23:40] <ajpiano> dendan: the point is, you should have some kind of flag so that you aren't sending back jquery.js and other site-wide libraries with every request
[08:23:47] <ajpiano> it's fine if you want to send *only* the page specific script
[08:23:54] <dendan> looks, this is not just plain php-html developing. ok? it is framwroks
[08:24:00] <ajpiano> lol
[08:24:19] <ajpiano> these techniques are backend-agnostic
[08:24:28] <dendan> have u ever worked with yii?
[08:24:29] <ajpiano> it doesn't matter whether you're using php or rails or django or whatever
[08:24:58] <ajpiano> none of these things FORCES you to load your entire site scripts on every single request unless you code yourself into a corner
[08:25:10] <dendan> do u know what is jquery ui widgets of yii?
[08:25:45] <ajpiano> looking it up now
[08:25:55] <ajpiano> dendan: it sounds like oyu might want support from someone who has worked with yii
[08:26:00] <ajpiano> and solved this problem in your framework
[08:26:12] <ajpiano> how to approach client side dependency management in an ajax app
[08:26:25] <^Mike> Is there such as a thing as a javascript audio player? We want to avoid using flash for playing samples of music on this musician's website.
[08:26:35] <dendan> when u render a widget it automatically inserts the script intot he page. so, in this case if no widget onthe page, then the script will not be loaded. so, let's say I load the page wiuth ajax. there is no way to check on the server side if was the scipt already loaded on client side or not
[08:26:40] <ajpiano> ^Mike: there's jplayer and soundmanager2
[08:26:54] <ajpiano> they all have flash fallbacks but can use HTML5 audio (aka "javascript player")
[08:27:08] <ajpiano> dendan: you don't have to "check"
[08:27:29] <ajpiano> dendan: you would make it so that if the page is requested over ajax, you omit sending back the scripts that you *know* don't need to be loaded again
[08:27:47] <ajpiano> you're always going to need to re-run the page specific js to apply to the html that you just injected, apparently
[08:28:57] <^Mike> ajpiano: okay, great, I'll take a look at both
[08:34:59] <foo> I'm having a caching issue with a js file on a home page of a site. I updated the js file but some browsers are caching it. If I rename the js file, it should automatically detect the changes and that should avoid any caching issues, right?
[08:39:32] <tk____> Is all of HTML5 supported in phonegap?  Having trouble finding good info in the docs...
[08:40:14] <tk____> whups, mistell sry
[08:43:06] <rmurphey> tk____: depends on what you mean by "all of HTML5" -- also depends on the device(s) you're targeting
[08:43:48] <s-Code> bloody Chrome date implementation not using ISO8601 (just sayin)
[08:44:59] <bencahill> Okay, I want Selectable with shift+click+shift, arrow keys, and jumping to an item.

[08:47:07] <farid> to a div
[08:48:51] <Krinkle> foo: Hey dude, I totally didn't account for the possibility of someone joining with the name "foo" :D
[08:48:53] <farid> I am doing an ajax. as a result i get some HTML with checkboxes in it. I append that to a DIV. How can I unappend that and add some other content
[08:49:54] <s-Code> set the .html() of the original div to nothing perhaps?
[08:50:16] <s-Code> .html("")
[08:50:32] <MimiEA> morning all
[08:51:12] <farid> that would remove everythin from div. I just want to remove content that was genarated through the ajax call.
[08:52:40] <NoiseEee> farid: well somehow you're going to have to identify that content... perhaps via a class as you add it / get the source.  class='dynamicContent' for example
[08:52:46] <farid> basically i have 2 check boxes. clicking one append a few check boxes related to it and click the other one adds its respective ones. I am hoping that by checking and uncheking i can append and detach the respective set of contents
[08:53:31] <foo> Krinkle: HAHA. ;)
[08:54:22] <farid> Noiseeeee.....interesting i can try that.. can i know the lable of the check box that has been clicked

[09:00:30] <bnb_dev> Hello
[09:01:07] <bnb_dev> how to validate multiple email addresses and it limit? means user can not enter more than 10 emails?
[09:03:09] <Zzaichik> I'd say you should look into regular expressions for validation.
[09:04:32] <bnb_dev> The following regular expression I am using to validate an email
[09:04:42] <McC> Found http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/email-validation-using-jquery/ with a quick google search, has regex on it
[09:05:16] <Zzaichik> Google sure is amazing..
[09:06:19] <bnb_dev> http://jsfiddle.net/gXGf9/
[09:08:18] <McC> if you're having issues with your regex, try: /^([\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/ (from the link I previously mentioned)
[09:08:22] <jrockjiggz> bnb_dev: http://jsfiddle.net/gXGf9/1/
[09:10:07] <McC> scratch that, the regext from the link I gave accepts empty strings.
[09:10:16] <McC> :-)
[09:10:34] <bnb_dev> jrockjiggz: yes it's already working but I want user can input 10 email addresses with a comma to separate them
[09:15:34] <MINTTU> what's wrong with my jquery code : http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/ 'Problem: trying to get a rolldown menu for Services button'

[09:18:18] <shokky> jrockjiggz: /^(?:([a-zA-Z0-9._]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})(?:,\s*)?){1,10}$/
[09:18:46] <MINTTU> farid: $('.idname').remove(); ?
[09:21:11] <shokky> actually i dont think thats right, jrockjiggz
[09:21:37] <McC_> bnb_dev yt?
[09:22:00] <McC_> This will limit to 10 entries, needs work for the delimiter: http://jsfiddle.net/eWqW8/
[09:22:13] <jrockjiggz> sorry i'm not by any means good with regex, its just an example.  here's it going through 10 addresses: http://jsfiddle.net/gXGf9/2/
[09:22:19] <bnb_dev> OK
[09:22:27] <bnb_dev> Thanks
[09:22:30] <McC_> right now its no spaces allowed
[09:22:40] <McC_> 1-10 entries
[09:22:47] <jrockjiggz> Let me know when you got it worked out ;)
[09:22:48] <McC_> straight ',' delim
[09:22:53] <farid> Thanks MINTTU
[09:24:20] <MINTTU> anyone got time to check out my site? got some jquery probs. Link private.
[09:25:49] <navaismo> Hi, I have a checkbox when its checked it change the label, but also change the style, how can i preserve the style and only change the label?
[09:25:59] <navaismo> This is my code http://pastebin.com/h7R217FL
[09:27:58] <shokky> jrockjiggz: just split the string on commas/spaces and validate each email
[09:28:37] <MINTTU> navaismo: do you have anything inside your id ? Where the string of text is set.
[09:29:34] <navaismo> MINTTU, yes
[09:30:19] <navaismo> looks: <input type="checkbox" id="check" /><label id="labelchk" for="check">Enable Followme</label>
[09:30:22] <cusco> ajpiano: still there? for some reason im struggling with .debounce
[09:30:41] <nFFFF> I need to have an image .png, if a user clicks on any non-transparent part, fire a click event, but _not_ for transparent parts of image, how do?
[09:30:51] <cusco> http://jsfiddle.net/JG4My/1/ has some js syntax error
[09:30:57] <MINTTU> navaismo: and after jquery?
[09:31:32] <ajpiano> you're passing a reference to a document ready function, yikes cusco :|
[09:31:53] <cusco> ?
[09:32:06] <ajpiano> you wrap debounce around the keyup handler
[09:32:09] <ajpiano> i'm fixing it
[09:32:22] <navaismo> MINTTU: when its checked i do this: $("#labelchk").text("Disable Followme");
[09:32:58] <MINTTU> navaismo: im not sure if text() can be used in those elements.
[09:33:01] <cusco> ajpiano: if you check update2 it works without debounce
[09:33:03] <MINTTU> try val()
[09:33:35] <ajpiano> cusco: that's cause your attempt at debounce isn't passing a function as the second argument
[09:33:43] <ajpiano> it's passing a jquery object
[09:33:44] <ajpiano> :|
[09:33:48] <ajpiano> $(function(){});
[09:33:50] <MINTTU> navaismo: meant ofc the html output :PÃ…
[09:34:20] <ajpiano> cusco: the general format you want is $("#availAddr").keyup( $.debounce( 250, function() { /*do Stuff */}) );
[09:34:43] <ajpiano> cusco: $.debounc returns a function reference with the wrapping that takes care of handling the timeout stuf
[09:34:43] <navaismo> MINTTU: using firefox, opera or chrome i can see how the checkbox change the text but delete the style
[09:35:18] <Zzaichik> navaismo: it sounds like you might want to check out the CSS file for :checked styles
[09:35:28] <Zzaichik> â€¦if I understand you correctly
[09:36:08] <codepython777> I'm uploading a file to the server and need to display a progressbar. what is the easiest way to do this?
[09:37:35] <navaismo> Zzaichik, that remind me why IM such a NEWBIE
[09:38:02] <navaismo> let me test brb, thanks Zzaichik & MINTTU
[09:38:56] <cusco> ajpiano: I thought about that
[09:39:04] <cusco> but in the examples they were calling functions
[09:39:22] <cusco> can I perfroms several intructions in /* do stuff */
[09:39:28] <cusco> ahh function() do stuff
[09:39:29] <cusco> nvm
[09:39:33] <ajpiano> yes, it's the body of ... function...
[09:40:38] <MINTTU> anyone got time to check out my site? got some jquery probs. Link private.
[09:41:48] <ppppaul> hey guys
[09:41:59] <MINTTU> im a girl
[09:42:18] <ppppaul> i'm trying to select an id that === 'something-with-a space in it'
[09:42:23] <ppppaul> it's not working
[09:42:37] <ppppaul> $('#something-with-a space in it')
[09:42:42] <ppppaul> that returns []
[09:42:46] <langui> MINTTU:  O_O...  seriously?
[09:42:59] <silverwind> ppppaul, then don't use a space in an id?
[09:43:01] <MINTTU> langui: seriously, not :)
[09:43:05] <langui> "Please help me, I'm a girl."
[09:43:19] <MINTTU> dick between legs
[09:43:30] <MINTTU> last time i checked
[09:43:46] <ppppaul> <silverwind> i'm not controlling my ids
[09:44:01] <ppppaul> is it possible to select an id with a space in it at all?
[09:44:06] <silverwind> ppppaul, you're fucked then
[09:44:10] <ppppaul> aw shit
[09:44:11] <silverwind> ppppaul, no, it's invalid in HTML
[09:44:16] <ppppaul> oh
[09:44:18] <ppppaul> hmmm
[09:44:19] <ppppaul> mmmmmmmmmmmmm
[09:44:20] <ppppaul> crap
[09:44:34] <ppppaul> maybe i can escape it
[09:44:59] <NoiseEee> if you have invalid html, who knows what js will do?  step 1) valid html.
[09:45:14] <ppppaul> my html is created from templates
[09:45:24] <NoiseEee> that means nothing to me
[09:45:35] <NoiseEee> supply a valid id to the template / use valid templates / whatever
[09:45:38] <ppppaul> sometimes i don't really want to worry about what the templates deal with, but in this case i guess i have to care
[09:45:52] <SmashingX> I'm working with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/4/ and it's doing what I need it to do (It checks Carpenter Association when I click on the carpenter checkbox) The only problem is that the computer should do something when Carpenter association is clicked which it doesn't happen unless I click on Carpenter Association directly. How can I force with javascript the server to think that I
[09:45:52] <SmashingX> clicked Carpenter Association by just clicking the carpenter checkbox?
[09:45:54] <MINTTU> if you dont care about those things, try $("firstword%20secondword")
[09:45:56] <MINTTU> if that works.
[09:46:06] <silverwind> ppppaul, ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[09:46:07] <SmashingX> If somebody can help me would be appreciated
[09:46:13] <ppppaul> that's what i'm trying MINTTU
[09:46:32] <ppppaul> oh crap, % wont work
[09:46:39] <ppppaul> well, time to use underscore.string
[09:46:42] <MINTTU> attribute selector?
[09:46:54] <silverwind> ppppaul, who the F wrote your HTML?
[09:46:56] <langui> ppppaul, your templates are broken.  Unless these are client-side templates, this isn't even a javascript problem.
[09:47:09] <ppppaul> they are client side
[09:47:24] <langui> then fix yo templates
[09:47:25] <SmashingX> does this even exist? ).attr('clicked', true);
[09:47:39] <ppppaul> my templates are fine, i have to format the information going into them
[09:48:22] <langui> just use whatever facilities your template library has for mutating values before you print them
[09:48:46] <MINTTU> SmashingX, try and see ;)
[09:48:47] <langui> if it doesn't have a strip_spaces filter, and won't let you write one, find a different library
[09:48:59] <ppppaul> i'm not using a turing complete templating language
[09:49:13] <langui> nobody said anything about turing-complete
[09:49:28] <ppppaul> i'm using javascript, i can change the data before it goes into the template
[09:49:30] <ppppaul> that's what i'm doing
[09:49:38] <ppppaul> this has nothing to do with my template lib
[09:49:45] <SmashingX> MINTTU: what do you want me to try and see?
[09:50:02] <MINTTU> attr('checked,true')
[09:50:29] <langui> I respectfully disagree with how you choose to modularize your code, but I also realize that it doesn't matter very much
[09:50:33] <SmashingX> MINTTU: isn't what I have already?
[09:50:53] <MINTTU> you asked.
[09:50:56] <MINTTU> : SmashingX Â· does this even exist? ).attr('clicked', true);
[09:51:09] <SmashingX> yes
[09:51:15] <SmashingX> I said clicked not checked
[09:51:50] <MINTTU> well, if your iq is higher than 10 you'll understand the point :)
[09:52:53] <SmashingX> MINTTU yeah, whatever, i don't know what the heck you mean
[09:53:34] <cusco> ajpiano: well, so I just changed from $.debounce( 250, $(function() { -- to --> $.debounce( 250, function() {
[09:53:46] <ajpiano> cusco: you can't just do it around the ajax
[09:53:52] <cusco> no errors now, but actions inside the .debounce does not get exec...
[09:53:52] <ajpiano> you have to do the entire keyup handler
[09:54:05] <cusco> ow..
[09:54:09] <cusco> :/
[09:54:18] <cusco> ok
[09:54:22] <MINTTU> SmashingX: what is attri("clicked",true) returning?
[09:55:26] <SmashingX> nothing
[09:57:16] <bokgroll> jqueryUI, dialogs, I need to make a button disappear after it's clicked. the documentation says `if you need access to the button, it is available as the target of the event object.` I have no idea how to get that, everything I tried says 'event' is not defined. Any ideas?
[09:58:04] <mdpt> hi
[09:58:18] <langui> SmashingX:  you want $whatever.attr("checked", "checked"), don't you?
[09:58:38] <cusco> ajpiano: ok it works but my intention is to only call the ajax once after the delay, not several times
[09:58:47] <SmashingX> if the name of the element is onbehalf[custom_57][Iron Workers #17] can I do $("onbehalf[custom_57][Iron Workers #17]").click(); or do I have to do $('input[id="onbehalf[custom_57][Iron Workers #17]"]').click();
[09:59:16] <xid> im using fgelinas timepicker addon for jqueryui and the $().timepicker() object exists, but it is not instantiating in the dom when i call it as documented
[09:59:34] <jrockjiggz> SmashingX: i believe you need to escape your brackets []
[09:59:48] <langui> SmashingX: s/id/name/, if it actually is "named" that
[10:00:53] <SmashingX> langui: what?
[10:01:07] <SmashingX> langui the fisrt or the second one?
[10:01:48] <xid> majorly disappointing
[10:01:58] <langui> SmashingX: If you're doing an attribute selector to find something with a certain name, it should be "name=", not "id="
[10:02:38] <langui> SmashingX:  Not sure about the brackets, like jrockjiggz said
[10:07:08] <MINTTU> anyone got time to check out my site? got some jquery probs. Link private.(please) :)
[10:07:33] <xid> my ID exists, and my function exists, so why doens't it fire
[10:09:20] <fallenreaper> anyone able to give me a hand with some query?
[10:09:28] <MINTTU> xid: js script added in html ?
[10:10:28] <MINTTU> meaning: <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.timePicker.js"></script>
[10:10:30] <Salvager> if i have a div with class="item-1", how can i get just the 1 into a jquery variable ?
[10:10:40] <fallenreaper> i was trying to do $.ajax in IE, but it wasnt returning successfully.  It works in GoogleChrome.  Does anyone know why that might be?  Are there certain attributes i need to set?
[10:11:44] <fallenreaper> salvager, you oculd cetch the class, and then split on"-" then get element 2?
[10:12:03] <fallenreaper> erm i mean, var x[1] as javascript starts at 0.
[10:12:15] <Salvager> im a real jquery noob, so that dindt make alot of sense hehe
[10:12:55] <MINTTU> Salvager: you always have item-<number> ?
[10:13:04] <Salvager> yes
[10:13:12] <jrockjiggz> Salvager: don't use class names to contain variables. use data attribute.  but if you must know: var classVar = $('div.item-1').attr('class'); classVar = classVar.charAt( classVar.length );
[10:13:28] <xid> MINTTU: yes
[10:13:47] <Salvager> thanks alot
[10:13:57] <fallenreaper> anyone know what goes on with my jquery script which works in all browsers but returns an error in IE?
[10:14:12] <fallenreaper> it was a ajax request
[10:14:23] <Salvager> the data attribute is a html5 atribute isnt it?
[10:14:36] <fallenreaper> a blog told me about using xdr, but i figured jquery knew how to handle it properly.
[10:15:06] <MINTTU> Salvager: var number = str.match(/[0-9]+/g); can also work.
[10:15:25] <MINTTU> if str is a variable containing the id
[10:15:43] <Salvager> allright thanks alot
[10:16:28] <Salvager> im trying to get the data of a PHP variable inside of a jquery variable, and the best solution i have found so far is that one. But is there a better solution that i dont know about?
[10:18:22] <jrockjiggz> Salvager: http://jsfiddle.net/mrmAa/
[10:20:10] <Salvager> how is the browser support for data-var="value" ?
[10:20:18] <jrockjiggz> html5
[10:20:26] <ajpiano> Salvager: it works everywhere
[10:20:37] <Salvager> well support is different for the different html5 tags
[10:20:39] <ajpiano> nothing breaks if you use it outside of an html5 doctype except for validation errors
[10:20:43] <ajpiano> i realise that
[10:20:50] <ajpiano> that doesn't mean support is different for data attributes
[10:21:04] <blaza> if/when html5 overtakes flash, how it replaces for example the flash games and such "apps"?
[10:21:17] <jrockjiggz> yes. data attribute doesn't break any older browsers, so its fully backwards compatible
[10:21:17] <Salvager> well thanks alot then :)
[10:22:12] <eternalsword> blaza, how do you mean?
[10:22:26] <langui> people still write flash?
[10:22:40] <langui> I don't think I even have flash installed O_O
[10:22:48] <langui> like, the player
[10:23:04] <blaza> what how?
[10:23:14] <langui> oh, I do, it's just turned off
[10:23:15] <fallenreaper> i was trying to do $.ajax in IE, but it wasnt returning successfully.  It works in GoogleChrome.  Does anyone know why that might be?  Are there certain attributes i need to set?
[10:23:18] <blaza> what's your opinion to my question :P
[10:23:50] <miksa> Does anyone know how to create spider chart using jQuery?   I was trying do it using dojo http://jsfiddle.net/U4Mn9/       but I can't change font-size of axis labels
[10:23:53] <blaza> if flash dies, how HTML5 replaces the flash games and such as a "platform"?
[10:23:57] <ravenzz> ?demo @ fallenreaper
[10:23:57] <bot-t> fallenreaper, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:24:33] <eternalsword> blaza, it replaces it just fine. not sure what you're asking for.
[10:24:47] <blaza> how it replaces?
[10:24:47] <langui> blaza: I'd say flash is already dead in everything except video, and youtube already has html5 video
[10:24:57] <blaza> what html5 enables compared to 4?
[10:25:06] <blaza> when it comes to programming games with javascript?
[10:25:18] <ajpiano> blaza: this is off topic for #jquery, please go to #html5
[10:25:28] <Miznitic> Is there anyway to remove a specific file from a file input that accepts multiple files? The spec shows it as readonly, but I've seen others do it.
[10:25:36] <blaza> I know, but that was one simple question which exploded ;D
[10:25:47] <ravenzz> Miznitic it is readonly actually
[10:26:00] <blaza> just came to my mind to ask because someone mentioned html5 couple of lines ago
[10:26:18] <blaza> but sorry anyways :P
[10:27:02] <eternalsword> Miznitic, you could remove the element completely and add a blank one to the dom.
[10:27:12] <jrockjiggz> blaza: http://speckyboy.com/2011/12/07/20-amazing-implementations-of-html5-canvas/
[10:28:11] <ravenzz> Miznitic probably others succeeded because of some ajax upload / fake input file/controls
[10:28:43] <Miznitic> remove() the input and replace on delete?
[10:29:59] <Miznitic> I had a custom swf/actionscript that used filereference that did all this, but now with the emergence of browsers that support it I'm looking to move in that direction.

[10:38:00] <RandyW> Hello. $(window).resize() doesn't seem to be working for me in IE except on page load.
[10:38:14] <huntedmitch> Hey guys, quick jQueryUI question. When I use the sortable plugin and register the 'sortstop' event, how do I see what the order change was? i.e. if I move the first element to the third slot I should be able to find 0, 2 somehow. Any ideas?
[10:38:41] <huntedmitch> RandyW: $(window).on('resize', function() { â€¦. });
[10:39:00] <RandyW> huntedmitch: Ooh thanks
[10:39:06] <huntedmitch> yw
[10:39:54] <SmashingX> What's wrong with this? if (this.checked && input[id="price_12[39]"].checked ='false') {
[10:40:03] <SmashingX> invalid assignment left-hand side
[10:40:06] <hectorh30> hi guys, quick one: what does it mean when a service has the attribute synthetic?
[10:40:12] <SmashingX> that's the error that it shows
[10:40:26] <Haprog> SmashingX: the array index needs to be a sstring
[10:40:44] <RandyW> huntedmitch: :( still only triggering on page load
[10:40:50] <Haprog> you have id= which is not in a string
[10:41:00] <SmashingX> Haprog how then>
[10:41:24] <Haprog> atleast that's the only syntax error there is
[10:41:29] <huntedmitch> RandyW: Try live instead of on?
[10:41:47] <Haprog> SmashingX: is input even an array there?
[10:42:07] <SmashingX> Haprog: but I have this line and it's not showing any errors $('input[id="price_12[39]"]').click();
[10:42:23] <MistuhKurtz> hm, so the twitter bootstrap jquery plugins have a ! in front of the IIFE
[10:42:26] <MistuhKurtz> what does that do?
[10:42:38] <Haprog> SmashingX: that's a CSS selector. nothing to do with arrays
[10:42:40] <RandyW> huntedmitch: Nope :(
[10:42:48] <MistuhKurtz> I know a ";" is supposed to clean up any poorly written javascript that might bungle up the plugin
[10:42:50] <navaismo> im back and no luck
[10:43:03] <Haprog> SmashingX: you're missing the $('') in your original line
[10:43:03] <huntedmitch> RandyW: That's weird. I use .on('resize' all the time
[10:43:41] <myrman> I just noticed that I'm banned from ##php, but does anyone here know a good contact form?
[10:43:43] <RandyW> One sec, pasting code
[10:43:53] <myrman> (Not sure why I'm banned though)
[10:43:58] <navaismo> you can try here http://jsfiddle.net/9pFvr/ and see how the icon disappear when you check the box. How can I preserve the ICON?
[10:44:13] <SmashingX> Haprog what line?
[10:44:22] <Haprog> SmashingX: then one that gives you the syntax error..
[10:44:32] <SmashingX> this one ? if (this.checked && input[id="price_12[39]"].checked ='false') {
[10:44:32] <Haprog> that you asked help for
[10:44:36] <Haprog> yes
[10:44:58] <cohitre> SmashingX: what do you want to do?
[10:45:01] <cohitre> ? ask @ SmashingX
[10:45:01] <bot-t> SmashingX, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:45:47] <SmashingX> Haprog you are saying I should do this? if (this.checked && $('input[id="price_12[39]"].checked ='false')') {
[10:46:11] <Salvager> should i use .data("my-value") or .data("myValue") to get the data from data-my-value="value" ?
[10:46:13] <SmashingX> cohitre what do you mean what I want to do?
[10:46:21] <Haprog> SmashingX: that's yet another way to do it wrong... just use $() like you did on the other line you said it was working
[10:46:41] <starsinmypockets> I need to add ajax pagination to multiple tables on a page... is there a good library or some boilerplate code that anyone knows of?
[10:46:45] <MistuhKurtz> Does anybody know the point of the "!" in front of a jquery plugin, like this? !(function($){ ... })(jQuery);
[10:46:50] <cohitre> what is that if supposed to accomplish?
[10:46:56] <Haprog> you probably want: if (this.checked && $('input[id="price_12[39]"]').checked ='false') {
[10:47:01] <SmashingX> Haprog you are saying I should do this? if (this.checked && $(input[id="price_12[39]"].checked ='false')) {
[10:47:05] <Haprog> though I can't be sure since you didn't explain what you're trying to do
[10:47:16] <SmashingX> what do I want to do?
[10:47:23] <SmashingX> I just want that if statement to work
[10:47:39] <Haprog> SmashingX: ok then. just do if (true) { and it will "work"
[10:47:46] <cohitre> MistuhKurtz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3755606/what-does-the-exclamation-mark-do-before-the-function
[10:48:08] <SmashingX> Haprog, yes but how to make that statement to be true inside
[10:48:12] <SmashingX> that's my problem
[10:48:27] <Haprog> I just told you. just write true and it will always be true
[10:48:33] <RandyW> huntedmitch: http://jsfiddle.net/5DCB4/
[10:48:35] <NoiseEee> SmashingX: also, ===false, not ='false'
[10:48:40] <Haprog> you're not helping us hel you at all
[10:48:43] <Haprog> *help
[10:48:56] <SmashingX> Haprog: what? I don't wnat it always to be true, I want it to be true when those two statements are true
[10:49:16] <Haprog> how the hell should we know what you're trying to accomplis with the condition in the if if you don't tell us!?
[10:49:25] <huntedmitch> RandyW: Would love to help dude, but I am on a Mac and I don't have time right now to boot up a VM. Sorry dude. :-(
[10:49:28] <Escherial> hello; this is kind of a silly question, but i'm writing a coda slider (yes, another one), and i'd like to measure the height of a div without the div being visible (i.e. either itself display: none or one of its parents). is that possible?
[10:49:39] <MistuhKurtz> ah thank you, cohitre. It's another way of writing an IIFE.
[10:49:45] <Escherial> more generally, does an element have dimensions when it or any of its parents are display: none?
[10:49:47] <langui> SmashingX: Sounds like you're looking for the && operator.  That can't be right...
[10:49:50] <cohitre> ? is @ SmashingX
[10:49:52] <bot-t> SmashingX, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[10:50:01] <RandyW> huntedmitch: Ok. Thanks anyhow
[10:50:02] <cohitre> ? :checked @ SmashingX
[10:50:02] <bot-t> SmashingX, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[10:50:29] <SmashingX> Haprog I don't think you need to know that but anyway what im trying to do is that the checkbox doesn;t select again if the checkbox is already selected
[10:50:29] <cohitre> ? # @ SmashingX
[10:50:30] <bot-t> SmashingX, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[10:50:49] <cohitre> SmashingX: there you go, that's what we needed to know
[10:51:04] <RandyW> Anybody else? Window resizing?
[10:51:06] <cohitre> $(this).is(":checked") checks if it is selected
[10:51:31] <SmashingX> cohitre: that's wrong
[10:51:31] <cohitre> so you want to capture the change event on the checkbox
[10:51:38] <cohitre> SmashingX: you're wrong
[10:51:48] <Haprog> SmashingX: you don't think I need to know that? that's like saying tell me how to make this statement work and give us gibberish that isn't even syntactically valid like if (dajhf h)U%(df07=)/df) {
[10:52:03] <cohitre> inside the change event you check if the checkbox is selected
[10:52:03] <Haprog> "I just want it to work!"
[10:52:11] <cohitre> and preventDefault accordingly
[10:52:15] <Escherial> erm, and for an even easier question, is $(selector).each() chainable? does it return the original selected set of elements?
[10:52:29] <cohitre> ? each @Escherial
[10:52:30] <bot-t> Escherial, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:52:56] <cohitre> Escherial: yes
[10:53:23] <hectorh30> sorry, wrong channel
[10:53:54] <Escherial> cohitre: thanks :) i was looking at the documentation earlier and they didn't mention what it returns
[10:55:00] <Escherial> if i want to fire a single custom event and have it caught somewhere else in my code, what's the most expedient way to do that? $(document).bind("customevent", handler) followed by $(document).trigger("customevent")?
[10:55:16] <ryanneufeld> Escherial: "Returns: jQuery" is at the top of the docs page :P
[10:55:25] <ryanneufeld> Escherial: yes

[10:55:35] <bot-t> Escherial, jQuery publish/subscribe plugin by Peter Higgins http://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[10:55:41] <ryanneufeld> sort of like that
[10:56:58] <Escherial> ryanneufeld: ah, i didn't realize that meant it'd return the selector, but duly noted. also, that pubsub script looks like exactly what i need, thanks :)
[10:57:10] <Escherial> better than hanging events off of random parts of the DOM
[10:57:12] <ryanneufeld> IT doesn't return a selector
[10:57:20] <ryanneufeld> it returns a jquery collection object
[10:57:35] <Escherial> sorry, not up on the terminology, but right, that makes sense
[10:58:09] <ryanneufeld> Escherial: yeah, not trying to draw the hard line on ya there. But knowing the right terms can help when asking for assistance. :)
[10:58:54] <tw2113> helping them learn the right terms is a skill as well
[10:59:08] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[10:59:22] <Salvager> which is syntax is considered best practice? data("my-value") or data("myValue") ??
[10:59:33] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: the second one
[10:59:41] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: though jquery will try both internally
[10:59:49] <NoiseEee> Salvager: data('myvalue') tbh
[11:00:08] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: according to w3c though camelcase is the acceptable way, but all lower is good too
[11:00:15] <pmcgovern> Hi. I'm running jquery 1.4.2 and jqueryui 1.8.14. I am trying to run a function if the input in a text field is numeric. I know I don't have this right - I want it to check with each letter input into the field. Can anyone point out my folly? http://pastie.org/4232920
[11:00:33] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: upgrade to 1.7.2 for starters :P
[11:00:40] <Salvager> ok ill use the second one :) thanks
[11:01:29] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: you need to bind to an event
[11:01:36] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: typically the keyup
[11:01:39] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: doing so yields numerous errors across the board, meaning all fo the other jquery I'm using isn't ready for an upgrade
[11:01:56] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: then upgrade teh rest of your jquery :P
[11:02:07] <ryanneufeld> 1.4.2 is ooooold lol
[11:02:25] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: that includes numerous 3rd party scripts. I will investigate that possibility after my current issue is resolved, if that is ok with you
[11:02:40] <pmcgovern> twow that sounded snotty and was NOT intended that way
[11:02:42] <pmcgovern> tmy apologies
[11:02:42] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: its fine
[11:02:48] <ryanneufeld> no worries man
[11:03:13] <ryanneufeld> I always advise using the latest stable release. But for what you're trying to do
[11:03:19] <ryanneufeld> what is jsonSuggest?
[11:03:32] <ryanneufeld> It looks like that is the plugin you're using for autocomplete?
[11:03:37] <pmcgovern> yes
[11:03:48] <ryanneufeld> okay, where are the docs for that plugin?
[11:03:52] <pmcgovern> http://tomcoote.co.uk/wp-content/CodeBank/Demos/JSONSuggestBox2/demo.html
[11:04:15] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: okay, so they don't have a callback, or filtering
[11:04:29] <Escherial> ryanneufeld: i appreciate the correction :) hrm, and i imagine that this is only going to work if the publisher sends the message after the subscriber has started listening (i.e. there's no message queue)
[11:04:35] <pmcgovern> in the options listing there is something called onSelect
[11:04:49] <ryanneufeld> Escherial: you could use deferreds for that
[11:04:51] <pmcgovern> but the docs words it as though that gets called after the url is called
[11:05:12] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: yes, it looks like it's called once they click on one of the suggestions
[11:05:45] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: you need to bind to the keyup event. See this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/995183/how-to-allow-only-numeric-0-9-in-html-inputbox-using-jquery
[11:05:48] <pmcgovern> so couldn't I do something like onKeyUp(fieldName){
[11:06:00] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: yes, you could
[11:06:07] <pmcgovern> perfect - thanks, ryanneufeld
[11:06:33] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: you shouldn't need to change the callbacks on the jsonSUggest
[11:06:46] <Salvager> whats the difference between function() and function (html) ??
[11:07:07] <ryanneufeld> BTW pmcgovern +1 to your for asking a question well.
[11:07:12] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: one has html
[11:07:15] <pmcgovern> Thanks!
[11:07:37] <Salvager> one do you mean that one has html?
[11:07:44] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: if I may persist - I am getting an error stating that jQuery.isNumeric is not a function, yet is see it referenced here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isNumeric/
[11:07:59] <pmcgovern> â€¦ I see that function was added in 1.7
[11:08:01] <pmcgovern> tmy apologies
[11:08:18] <pmcgovern> minecraft has conditioned me to type 't' before writing anything lol
[11:08:25] <Escherial> pmcgovern: i know the feeling :|
[11:08:29] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: dunno what minecraft is
[11:08:35] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: but look here: http://pastie.org/4232956
[11:08:43] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: better to not know - it is a game made entirely out of crack cocaine
[11:08:47] <Escherial> sandbox game written in java of fairly significant popularity, but no matter
[11:08:55] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: that's how you're gonna want to do your bindings.
[11:09:00] <cohitre> Salvager: if you are asking in the context of jQuery functions one will act as an attribute reader and one as a setter
[11:09:06] <ryanneufeld> Escherial: I know what it is. I was being lame
[11:09:15] <Escherial> ryanneufeld: ah u_u
[11:09:22] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: exactly what I did after your cuggestion :)
[11:09:30] <ryanneufeld> cohitre: not always. Sometimes passing a parameter does nothing
[11:09:37] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: I'll just use simple regex to check for a numeric value
[11:09:38] <ryanneufeld> cohitre: see first(), index()
[11:09:45] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: yup
[11:09:56] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: if you're comfortable with that, it's a good way to go
[11:10:16] <pmcgovern> There's a great os x app called patterns that makes shaping regex MUCH easier
[11:10:19] <cohitre> * if you are asking in the context of some jQuery functions one will act as an attribute reader and one as a setter
[11:10:48] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: I use this: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[11:11:11] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: has live highlighting of the regexp results, a bunch of suggestions, and shows the results of find/replace
[11:11:16] <ryanneufeld> and doesn't need to be an app :P
[11:11:24] <pmcgovern> patterns does the same, but this is nice
[11:11:35] <Salvager> http://pastebin.com/y4PkLjtb
[11:11:37] <pmcgovern> I'd rather have apps so I can cycle my browser without losing my work
[11:11:54] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: good point
[11:12:05] <Salvager> if i change functions(html) to functions() what would happen?
[11:12:37] <cohitre> Salvager: then it would break.
[11:12:39] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: html would be undefined in the context of the send_to_editor function
[11:12:41] <cohitre> Salvager: what do you want to do?
[11:12:48] <MINTTU> Here's my university's contribution for this years Formula Student competition for those interested :) http://ladda-upp.se/bilder/roivshwdrnuqg/ (uploaded image)
[11:13:08] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: the html in this case is a parameter for the send_to_editor function
[11:13:12] <Salvager> i just want to understand it, before i use it hehe
[11:13:33] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: so somewhere in some code, someone will be calling window.send_to_editor('<some html content');
[11:13:50] <ryanneufeld> or they may leave off the window. part as it's not really needed
[11:13:52] <iliketurtles> I'm running a .toolTip method from aToolTip (http://ara-abcarians.com/jquery/atooltip/) inside .on('hover', function(){ .aToolTip(); }) -- I have to hover over the object twice for this to be fired, any idea why?
[11:14:22] <Salvager> allright thanks alot :)
[11:14:27] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: yeh, you don't call it that way
[11:14:44] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: looking at the docs, you just call $(selector).aToolTip()
[11:14:50] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: and it handles the hover event for you
[11:15:14] <iliketurtles> ryanneufeld: well the original issue I'm having is that inside aToolTip the jquery $(this) selector isn't returning the object that fired the aToolTip, but the WHOLE window object
[11:15:16] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: which is why you're having issues, since it's probably (I'm guessing here) using the same methods internally to detect the hover
[11:15:37] <iliketurtles> so I devised a hack, to use the .on("hover") instead.  probably not the best solution
[11:15:43] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: clearly
[11:15:56] <iliketurtles> essentially I want to pass some HTML that's already in the DOM to the aToolTip()'s content param
[11:16:13] <iliketurtles> but I can't reference it dynamically since I don't have access to the selector that called aToolTip
[11:16:36] <iliketurtles> or, rather I'm not sure WHICH selector called aToolTip -- I suppose I could access it throught the window object
[11:16:44] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: hmm. well that sounds like something the developer of the library might be able to help you with
[11:16:58] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: I am getting the error: $("input#productSearch").onKeyUp is not a function   yar?

[11:19:21] <iliketurtles> ryanneufeld: ok cool, it allows HTML to be easily passed as the content to a tooltip?
[11:19:38] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: sure does
[11:19:47] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: also, his docs are gone
[11:19:56] <ryanneufeld> iliketurtles: so, you might have to play with it

[11:20:36] <iliketurtles> ah yeah i think ive used qtip before
[11:20:46] <ryanneufeld> I like all of those
[11:20:53] <ryanneufeld> we went with tiptip due to size
[11:21:06] <ryanneufeld> but if that's not a big concern, then the other ones are more flexibl IIRC

[11:22:01] <iliketurtles> ryanneufeld: i'm most interested in the ability to know which selector invoked the tooltip, so i can pass the appropriate HTML tointo the tooltip
[11:22:17] <iliketurtles> i think i will try qtip...i know I've used it with HTML before, but not sure about the selector issue

[11:26:57] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, jquery does not have a .value attribute or method....it's .val()
[11:27:34] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: oops, just missed.... and hi how are you... i am still stuck with that validate ... :)
[11:28:03] <Whirl3d> I noticed. I'm good thanks. what are you stuck on?
[11:28:27] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: now, using this http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/  till now not much issues, still following your code as well :)
[11:29:00] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: demo: http://jsfiddle.net/BppZs/
[11:29:59] <exalt> hey hey
[11:30:10] <sekyms> ajpiano: you around sir
[11:30:19] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: FIFY http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/BppZs/2/
[11:30:36] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: if you're using an id selector
[11:30:38] * pmcgovern facepalms
[11:30:42] <pmcgovern> yeah
[11:30:44] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, what are you trying to validate so carefully?
[11:30:44] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: don't bother with the element type
[11:30:46] <pmcgovern> lol
[11:31:02] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: also, don't bother selecting it again in the handler, use this
[11:31:11] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: the form.... this time i think i am on right track ;)  going on well until now
[11:31:16] <ryanneufeld> and then you need to match the val() of the input
[11:31:27] <Whirl3d> what kind of form is it?
[11:31:37] <exalt> i made a menu item highlighter, when a link is clicked i change its class but it only works for a second then the old value is returned, what do i forget: http://pastebin.com/YknqCPbk ?
[11:32:26] <Whirl3d> The reason that I ask is that when you consider the amount of time you have spent trying to get the form to validate and you compare that to the amount of hassle you might experience if invalid data is sent, it might give you a different set of priorities.
[11:33:06] <Whirl3d> Especially when you consider that form validation is usually just a pain in the ass for customers...
[11:34:57] <Whirl3d> Even the nicest form validation techniques are confrontational...so for a couple of sites that I have worked on lately, my customers decided against any sort of validation that says, "you, potential customer' are wrong or have made a mistake
[11:35:00] <NoiseEee> not to mention needs to be duplicated entirely at the backend
[11:35:53] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: nope, din't touch it after 1 day we solved it... that form validations had some limitations and problems, it was dropped next day itself, and only started with new one today :) and its for our own product, so no problem of customers as such. got some ample time :)
[11:35:57] <Whirl3d> but often it's just not that big of a deal. I mean who cares if you get the wrong first and last name in a generic contact form...but if it's an application for loan...that's different.
[11:36:25] <chilversc> not that a form can validate first/last name anyway
[11:36:39] <eternalsword> better to just do the validation on the backend and detect the problems via an ajax post.  more backwards compatible.  unless you are really caught up on bandwidth savings.
[11:36:49] <Whirl3d> You would be surprised how many validation formulas there are for first/last name.
[11:36:57] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: here: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/BppZs/3/
[11:37:18] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: the reason to not use regexp, is that you can't test for normal keyboard keys like arrows and backspace
[11:37:21] <Whirl3d> I had one that looked up first and last names in a database of cartoon characters and rejected any matches
[11:37:23] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: lol .... surely will be surprised. ...
[11:37:31] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: so this 'plugin' does the trick
[11:37:48] <rabbi1> ajax ?
[11:38:05] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: thank you
[11:38:12] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, but maybe what you are looking for more than validation is assisted input
[11:38:34] <Whirl3d> things like autosuggest or autocorrect
[11:38:35] <Salvager> does this create a variable or is it for something else ? imgurl = jQuery(img,html).attr("src");
[11:38:36] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: np, BTW, I took that code from the stackoverflow link I sent you. Just so you know, you don't think i wrote it.
[11:38:38] <eternalsword> rabbi1: was that question directed at me?
[11:38:43] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: perhaps you could upvote the guy
[11:38:52] <pmcgovern> sure thing :)
[11:39:16] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: yeah, kind of... it's very imp for this product, as any user cannot be allowed to enter wrong data as it produces wrong results .... very important
[11:39:40] <rabbi1> eternalsword: nope, sorry
[11:39:43] <Whirl3d> have you looked at input masking?
[11:39:53] <rabbi1> not really
[11:40:23] <eternalsword> Salvager, that will store the attribute src in that imgurl variable. be careful with scope.
[11:40:24] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: i did. but din't seem like using it. will be toomany masking on the forms :)
[11:40:53] <Salvager> but it dosent say var imgurl = .... it only says imgurl = ...
[11:41:10] <Salvager> can you create variables without the var in front?
[11:41:17] <NoiseEee> Salvager: not a good idea
[11:41:47] <silverwind> Salvager, yes... but it creates a global, avoid it.
[11:41:49] <eternalsword> yes, but it has no scope, so may overwrite.
[11:41:57] <EyePulp> Salvager: var foo, bar, baz;   <-- you can initialize multiple at once though
[11:42:06] <Salvager> ok thanks
[11:42:10] <Whirl3d> The only hesitance I have with your current choice of validation methods is that it's kind of hackish to include validation methods (not styles per say, but actual method calls) in the class attribute of an element.
[11:42:27] <Whirl3d> Especially when the data- prefixed attributes are available.
[11:43:20] <Whirl3d> data-validation="required" seems so much better than class='validation[required] all my other classes for styling and such'
[11:43:39] <rmurphey> rabbi1: somoene else may have already said this but, you absolutely cannot trust client-side validation as your only validation
[11:43:52] <rmurphey> also, +1 to Whirl3d's concern re validation directives in classes
[11:43:56] <rmurphey> use data attributes
[11:44:04] <karl_heinz> Whirl3d: I take it you were using validation engine?
[11:44:33] <NoiseEee> yeah but a class of 'required' lets you both access it JS wise, and look fancy CSS wise
[11:44:34] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: rmurphey: I agree, but i am not using HTML5..
[11:44:51] <danzik17> rabbi1: that doesn't matter, data attributes will work fine, they just won't pass a doc validation
[11:44:51] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: this seems to dis-allow pasting
[11:44:59] <rabbi1> karl_heinz: not him, i was
[11:45:02] <Whirl3d> I was trying to help our friend rabbi1 comr up with a good solution for validation...
[11:45:08] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: well, keep googling, you can find a way to allow controll keys
[11:45:12] <ryanneufeld> *control
[11:45:13] <pmcgovern> I am
[11:45:54] <Protected> Hey there
[11:46:02] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: check this again: http://stackoverflow.com/a/995193/585083
[11:46:24] <Protected> I'm trying ajax with jquery for the first time. Here's my "code": http://pastebin.com/PzJLANfd
[11:46:33] <Whirl3d> rabbi1 you can put any attributes you want in an html element   so <div rabbi1sattr='waycoool' > would not cause problems expect if you were trying to get it to pass doctype validation...which you probably don't need to.
[11:46:36] <zackiv31> is there a way to bind an action whenever a specific #id is visible, and unbind when it is not?
[11:46:39] <pmcgovern> ryanneufeld: macs don't use ctrl for paste :)
[11:46:39] <rabbi1> danzik17: yeah, planning to get that data* for the next version.....
[11:46:57] <Protected> I was wondering why firebug reports a Syntax error on the content of data, which is text, even though it works perfectly otherwise
[11:46:58] <pmcgovern> but I get where you're going
[11:46:58] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: nope, they don't, but I think that's accounted for
[11:47:02] <pmcgovern> tI will continue investigatoing
[11:47:17] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: inspect the event object by doing a console.log() of it
[11:47:35] <ryanneufeld> pmcgovern: and see what you have avail. Update your fiddle and test
[11:47:42] <pmcgovern> will do
[11:47:43] <pmcgovern> thank you
[11:47:44] <rabbi1> danzik17: Whirl3d: IE8 ? i know IE9 supports .... kindly correct, if i am not wrong
[11:47:51] <Protected> Any ideas?
[11:48:57] <danzik17> rabbi1: it'll work fine.
[11:49:46] <Protected> Anyone here uses firefox and firebug?
[11:49:56] <bwq> eww
[11:50:00] <bwq> get chrome
[11:50:01] <tw2113> i think probably a lot of people
[11:50:07] <tw2113> fuck chrome too
[11:50:21] <Protected> Firefox has many advantages over chrome, although the opposite is also true
[11:50:29] <rabbi1> kool
[11:50:34] <tw2113> they both do their jobs and do them well
[11:50:40] <rabbi1> will have a look, better to have it now, than later
[11:50:46] <Protected> Right now I was wondering why when jquery.ajax returns some text, firebug is saying the text has a 'syntax error'
[11:50:54] <AndrewCMetzger> I love Firebug!
[11:50:59] <Protected> I'm completely new to jquery here
[11:51:28] <Whirl3d> That's all I was concerned about. If you are just exploring new options now, let's try to stay away from some of the more "hackish" ways of validating things...
[11:52:20] <Escherial> hmm, having kind of a sticky issue where i have a series of floated divs of fixed width, but variable height inside of a very long div, which itself is inside of a fixed-size div with overflow: none
[11:52:28] <Whirl3d> Protected, let me be the first to suggest that you try jsfiddle.net
[11:52:29] <Escherial> (kind of the standard setup for a slider afaik)
[11:53:01] <Escherial> in firefox, i can get the real height of each internal floated div, but for some reason i can't in chrome
[11:53:06] <Whirl3d> it's free and it's a great testbed for jquery /html/css, etc. You could setup your code and share the url back here and people can help you solve the issues you are having
[11:53:13] <rabbi1> :) fully protected
[11:53:33] <Escherial> oh, it's probably because the floated image inside of the div is stretching out its parent in firefox, but not in chrome (which is, on second thought, probably the correct behavior)
[11:53:50] <Escherial> does that make sense?
[11:53:53] <Protected> I pasted the code above :P
[11:53:58] <Protected> Let me check out jsfiddle
[11:54:20] <MistuhKurtz> When writing a jQuery plugin, what are the advantages of defining a class and using prototype to define additional functions, versus creating an object with multiple functions?
[11:55:04] <Whirl3d> When you use prototype, every instance of your plugin can draw from the central library (the prototype)
[11:55:26] <Whirl3d> when you define them in one big object, each instance has those methods defined in itself
[11:55:50] <Whirl3d> it doesn't get the advantage of the shared master resource, and it gets bloaty
[11:56:01] <monk12> Does anyone know if this is possible. i have a form action like so: <form action="blah.html" method="GET"> I'd like with jquery to append some params onto it (form.html?_uta=blah&anotherGAvar=bleh) then let the GET form go on as normal. My question is will browser automatically know to add the other params onto that url (so url will look like: form.html?_uta=blah&anotherGAvar=bleh&Hidden_Input=FOO&Text_Field=POO)?
[11:56:38] <Whirl3d> with prototype, you change it one and everyone is updated. With object-based instantiation, you have to find each instance and redefine that method
[11:56:42] <Protected> I'm not sure jsfiddle can help me figure out the behavior of firebug :P My code works perfectly despite the error
[11:56:51] <monk12> (About to test it out, just thought I'd test peeps theoretical skills hehe.)
[11:56:52] <MistuhKurtz> So, prototype is useful for a plugin that needs to be able to be used multiple times in the same document?
[11:57:24] <danzik17> monk12: just use hidden inputs, you shouldn't need JS for this.
[11:57:37] <codepython777> any suggestions for a text popup library (for mostly showing exceptions)?
[11:57:45] <Whirl3d> cool. I don't waste my time with pastebin or pastie or other unusable-2d views into a small portion of broken code. I am sure others can help, but it's just not worth it to me
[11:57:59] <SmashingX> do you use & and && in a if statement?
[11:59:15] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, what do you perceive the advantages to using object-style instantiation?
[11:59:31] <monk12> danzik17, cant do that i believe... GA has a way to pass these params automatically via their _linkByPost functions set on the form's onsubmit. but  it doesnt work for GET forms (even though their docs say it qoute *should*). so i need to manually make the form url with the google params via _getLinkerUrl, making that the action, then letting the form continue to submit, which hopefully will add the normal form data.
[11:59:50] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know, I just hadn't used prototype before :) actually I've never even written a jQuery plugin before either. I'm taking a shot at it now
[12:00:11] <MistuhKurtz> so I'm reading through all the jquery plugin pattern articles I can find
[12:00:43] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, I use prototype because it allows me to segment my logic and combine it better. It may not be the best way to do it, but it works for me...
[12:00:44] <MistuhKurtz> prototype vs objects struck me as pretty similar and I wasn't sure what benefits one had over the other
[12:01:30] <MistuhKurtz> I'm reading about the Widget Factory pattern and it looks like it uses a combination of object and prototype, and I can't quite grok it, haha: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[12:02:10] <Whirl3d> I create an object with all of one category of methods...say my "content" methods and I call it contentAPI   and then another object with my utility methods maybe called utilityAPI and then I extend the prototype of my plugin with my API objects for inheritence and it works pretty smoothly
[12:03:08] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[12:03:13] <MistuhKurtz> that does sound like a nice solution.
[12:04:50] <monk12> bleh that didnt work. it just overwrote the form's action "form.html?utmparams=etc" with "form.html?formparams=etc". guess i have to deserialize the form data from the _getLinkerUrl, then put into hidden inputs as you kinda suggested.
[12:05:41] <Whirl3d> btw, that's a great article MistuhKurtz
[12:06:27] <MistuhKurtz> Cool, good to know I"m reading the good stuff :P I like that it has tons of links to other articles... many of them by plugin authors I'm familiar with, who have made great plugins
[12:06:42] <mindtheory> hmm anyone have any idea why some of these divs disappear and then pop back on when window is resized? http://dev.jamesacres.com/stdev/ but doesn't do that in safari or chrome?
[12:09:04] <SmashingX> SOmebody can help kme with this? http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/10/  Why when I click the first time on bricklayers #5 the Mason contractors gets selected but it doesn't get selected when I click bricklayers#16?
[12:09:27] <Whirl3d> I like the widget-factory dom-bridge pattern bascially. It usually makes more sense to me to have my plugin instance associated with a dom element (and stored in it's data property). Then I bind my custom methods to the element allowing the plugin to acts like a "controller" of sorts.
[12:10:13] <Whirl3d> So when you say $("elem").trigger("customMethod") , the "controller" object is activated and handles the event
[12:12:56] <MistuhKurtz> wow, that article covers a ton of patterns Whirl3d, haha.
[12:15:00] <SmashingX> SOmebody can help kme with this? http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/10/  Why when I click the first time on bricklayers #5 the Mason contractors gets selected but it doesn't get selected when I click bricklayers#16?
[12:15:02] <Salvager> how can i insert an image without refreshing the page?
[12:15:06] <Whirl3d> SmashingX try not to use the click event to set your checked property on an element. As you can see it's not really reliable like that. Set the property explicitly if that's what you want.
[12:15:19] <Salvager> jQuery(".test02-wrapper").append('<img alt="" scr="'+ imgurl +'">'); dosent work
[12:15:26] <Salvager> it never loads the image
[12:15:34] <Salvager> even though it inserts the html
[12:15:44] <Whirl3d> And don't spam the channel just cause you are getting the attention you want.
[12:16:15] <gmurphey> Salvager: src vs scr
[12:16:53] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, what do you think of this article? I like their approach: http://www.debuggable.com/posts/how-to-write-jquery-plugins:4f72ab2e-7310-4a74-817a-0a04cbdd56cb
[12:16:59] <Salvager> OMG how could i miss that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:17:13] <Salvager> thanks
[12:17:19] <Salvager> stupid me lol
[12:19:02] <SmashingX> Whirl3d Im not spamming the channel
[12:19:32] <SmashingX> Whirl3d: I tried to use attr if that's what you mean but it didn't work for me. So I had to choose click
[12:20:08] <Whirl3d> I notice you are using jquery 1.3.2   have you tried updating jquery ?
[12:21:06] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, I prefer to keep the default settings for my plugin in the prototype. It allows you to expose a method that resets the default behaviour for all your elements at once
[12:23:10] <MistuhKurtz> How do you accomplish that Whirl3d ? I've seen stuff like: $.fn.pluginName.defaults = { opt: 'value' };
[12:23:19] <MistuhKurtz> But does that clutter up the name space, and is ill-advised?
[12:23:37] <cwatson> Can someone convert javascript into jquery for me? Or know a tool that does for free?
[12:23:41] <NoiseEee> SmashingX: you should start from scratch, really no offense. your ids are totally invalid, and you don't write a function per checkbox, you write a single function that can deal with multiple checkboxes
[12:23:56] <MoTiOnXml> lol :)
[12:24:08] <MistuhKurtz> lol, jquery is javascript cwatson ;)
[12:24:38] <cwatson> jQuery is a framework of javascript, yes.
[12:25:10] <NoiseEee> cwatson: whats the point?  cross-browser support?
[12:25:10] <Escherial> cwatson: it's written in javascript...it's better described as a library
[12:25:19] <cwatson> Yes, cross-browser support.
[12:25:24] <NoiseEee> cwatson: you'd have to hire someone really
[12:25:37] <cwatson> Ah.
[12:26:01] <bwq> just use angularjs :V
[12:26:02] <starsinmypockets> Anyone know if tabs are instantiated differently in the legacy (1.8.21) version of jquery ui, or where the docs for this version reside?
[12:28:57] <Whirl3d> if you do this: function Mything(el, opts) { if (methodsAPI[el]) {methodsAPI[el].apply(Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments,1))
[12:29:58] <Whirl3d> allows you to send a "method name " to your plugin like myPugin("SetDefaults",obj)....then you just define a "SetDefaults" method in your methodsAPI object
[12:31:42] <Whirl3d> I also hack the $.extend method to allow the syntax $.extend(false, obja, objb)....which is slightly different than $.extend(obja, objb) or $.extend(true, obja, objb)...
[12:32:44] <Whirl3d> instead of passing true as the first parameter (which means do a deep copy of the objectes), I pass false to indicate that I only want the properties available in the first object to be copies from the ssubsequent objects
[12:33:21] <Whirl3d> so that way I don't end up extending my plugin with a bunch of extra crap if it deosn't need it.
[12:34:45] <Kreczor_work> Whirl3d: It's highly reccommended you don't alter the jQuery library. I suggest you revert those changes as it could cause some unexpected results
[12:39:07] <TrentonDAdams> Any reasons why addClass wouldn't work?
[12:42:03] <TrentonDAdams> I have the answer.  The selector is incorrect.
[12:42:05] <TrentonDAdams> :D
[12:42:06] <DeltaHeavy> TrentonDAdams: It wouldn't work because your code's wrong. Copy paste the code
[12:42:08] <DeltaHeavy> Ah yay =D
[12:42:56] <TrentonDAdams> Yeah, my word on my class was plural, and my selector didn't have an 's'. :D
[12:43:38] <mindtheory> anyone have experience with using tweenlite/max and having divs flash on and off in safari while animating?
[12:44:02] <mindtheory> driving me bananas ;)
[12:49:58] <innociv> I have '50px' and '50%' how do I seperate the number from the whatever you want to call px/%?
[12:50:08] <shoky> Whirl3d: answered your pm
[12:54:13] <danzik17> innociv: you could just use parseInt( "50px", 10 )
[12:55:48] <innociv> danzik17, what if it's 500?  And how does that get me the px/%?
[12:56:05] <innociv> Er I mean
[12:56:08] <innociv> I know I can parseint
[12:56:12] <innociv> but I need the px/% like I siad.
[12:56:15] <innociv> I need to know which it is.
[12:57:04] <NoiseEee> then search for it
[12:58:08] <danzik17> innociv: you didn't say you needed the px.  but, you can just just do "50px".replace( /^\d+/, "" )
[12:58:41] <innociv> <innociv> I have '50px' and '50%' how do I seperate the number from the whatever you want to call px/%?
[12:59:23] <innociv> I said seperate, not just get the numerical.
[12:59:46] <innociv> ?eval
[12:59:46] <bot-t> innociv: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[12:59:55] <innociv> ?eval "50px".replace( /^\d+/, "" )
[13:00:00] <bot-t> innociv: "px"
[13:00:03] <innociv> ?eval "50%".replace( /^\d+/, "" )
[13:00:04] <bot-t> innociv: "%"
[13:00:11] <innociv> Thanks.
[13:00:32] <NoiseEee> or use capturing groups and regex
[13:01:16] <NoiseEee> var res = /(\d+)(px|em)/.exec('50px');  console.log(res)
[13:01:38] <NoiseEee> var res = /(\d+)(px|em|%)/.exec('50px');  console.log(res)
[13:01:50] <NoiseEee> res[1] = number;  res[2] = untis
[13:06:11] <SmashingX> NoiseEee: What do you mean by my ids are totally invalid?
[13:06:49] <NoiseEee> SmashingX: id="onbehalf[custom_57][Bricklayers #16]" <--- invalid
[13:07:06] <NoiseEee> not to mention, you're using IDs to talk about some other stuff unrelated to the ID.  use data- attributes or something
[13:08:12] <SmashingX> NoiseEee: Could you tell me how have to do it then?
[13:08:53] <SmashingX> I mean the id
[13:09:27] <NoiseEee> the id should be about the dom element, not about what other elements its linked to, etc etc
[13:09:41] <NoiseEee> i can't tell you how to do it, all i can tell you is that you shoudl rethink your code from the ground up.
[13:10:41] <NoiseEee> also, using a class like 'form-checkbox' is silly
[13:10:54] <NoiseEee> you KNOW its a checkbox because thats the element it is
[13:11:54] <SmashingX> NoiseEee> ok
[13:11:57] <NoiseEee> i know you might have expected 'well SmashingX, you just do this and this and voila, it will work!'  but your code illustrates that you have a lot of reading/understanding left before you can write decent JS
[13:12:23] <SmashingX> NoiseEee I just need to have that working, it doesn't matter how the checkboxes are defined,
[13:13:09] <SmashingX> NoiseEee and I don't need to understand js very well, im try just to create a solution for this problem
[13:13:13] <NoiseEee> right, well i'm sure someone might be able to help your 'need to have that working' but personally i am uninterested in perpetuating terribly written code by someone with no interest in learning how to do things properly
[13:13:22] <NoiseEee> SmashingX: well maybe someone will come to your rescue... good luck
[13:13:29] <SmashingX> thanks
[13:14:25] <SmashingX> My area of work is different than js, so I just need to fix this and I'm not going to touch js again
[13:17:04] <SmashingX> SOmebody can help kme with this? http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/10/  Why when I click the first time on bricklayers #5 the Mason contractors gets selected but it doesn't get selected when I click bricklayers#16?
[13:17:18] <john3s> SmashingX: Based only on the quasi-logic in your JS example, I think this will work.  Plus I removed all your extra hidden fields with duplicate names. http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/15/
[13:17:18] <luchenbill> sorry for such a noob question, but i'm trying to streamline/make this function way better... http://jsfiddle.net/YfQn4/3/ currently i'm doing it by assigned classes and I know there must be a way to make it WAY better and even work correctly
[13:21:16] <luchenbill> all I want to do is when a link on the right is clicked, a respective image is displayed on the left...
[13:21:38] <luchenbill> the top link works, it was just obvious at that point that i'm not doing it right... as I know not everything should have to be hard coded like that
[13:26:14] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em)/.exec('50');
[13:26:16] <bot-t> innociv: null
[13:26:21] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em)/.exec('50px');
[13:26:22] <bot-t> innociv: ["50px", "50", "px"]
[13:26:27] <Brodingo> luchenbill heh http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/YfQn4/4/
[13:26:45] <innociv> NoiseEee, sorry but what would I need to do to make (px|em) optional?
[13:26:50] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)?(px|em)/.exec('50px');
[13:26:51] <bot-t> innociv: ["50px", "50", "px"]
[13:26:53] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)?(px|em)/.exec('50');
[13:26:54] <bot-t> innociv: null
[13:27:04] <shoky> add a question mark after it
[13:27:20] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em)?/.exec('50');
[13:27:20] <bot-t> innociv: ["50", "50", undefined]
[13:27:27] <luchenbill> Brodingo: haha nice! the only reason I was thinking using jquery was because I was going to add a fadin/out as well as some how automate the image swapping maybe with a timer or something?
[13:27:30] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em)?/.exec('50')[2];
[13:27:31] <bot-t> innociv: undefined
[13:27:39] <luchenbill> but that was after I got this first step working etc
[13:27:39] <innociv> I was close. Thanks.
[13:28:14] <shoky> ah you tried before, didnt notice ;p
[13:28:46] <Brodingo> luchenbill right, well theres plenty of tuts of how to do that yourself, but also some great plugins too
[13:28:52] <Brodingo> ?g jquery cycle
[13:28:54] <bot-t> Brodingo, JQuery Cycle Plugin - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[13:29:26] <luchenbill> Brodingo: yeah I have used several plugin's but i'm at the point now on "how does it actually work"
[13:30:05] <shoky> ?eval /(\d+)(?:px|em)?/.exec('50');
[13:30:06] <bot-t> shoky: ["50", "50"]
[13:30:27] <Brodingo> well a bit like you were trying but more complex obviously, an area with overflow hidden, and all the children are absolutely positioned and just swapped out with various css properties
[13:31:13] <shoky> innociv: add ?:  to the beginning of parenthesized stuff like (px|em)  if you dont want the parens to capture, i.e. their contents won't show up in the matches array
[13:31:24] <NoiseEee> innociv: don't forget to put '%' in there too  ?eval /(\d+)(px|em|%)?/.exec('50%');
[13:31:35] <innociv> Yeah
[13:31:48] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)?:(px|em|%)/.exec('50%')[2]
[13:31:48] <bot-t> innociv: TypeError: /(\d+)?:(px|em|%)/.exec("50%") is null
[13:32:02] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(?:px|em|%)/.exec('50%')[2]
[13:32:03] <bot-t> innociv: undefined
[13:32:11] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em|%)/.exec('50%')[2]
[13:32:12] <bot-t> innociv: "%"
[13:32:22] <shoky> also you might want decimals too ;p
[13:32:22] <gmurphey> \q
[13:32:28] <innociv> ?eval /(\d+)(px|em|%)?/.exec('50%')[2]

[13:32:37] <bot-t> innociv: undefined
[13:32:45] <innociv> Sorry about that. Er well I doubt I'll want decimals
[13:32:45] <NoiseEee> also feel free to use your browser console to test this...
[13:32:54] <innociv> Yeah I thought I'd be done with it quicker.
[13:33:13] <innociv> I'm parsing css numberal values here.  But, bah, yeah there is opacity.
[13:33:26] <innociv> numberical*
[13:36:09] <SmashingX> Is there a way to put the three functions into 1 function? http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/17/
[13:37:21] <innociv> Use a switch()?
[13:38:05] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/sDkwU/18/ or is this what you want?
[13:38:20] <innociv> oh nevermind
[13:38:41] <innociv> I'm not sure without thinking about it too much
[13:39:33] <SmashingX> oh ok
[13:39:51] <SmashingX> it seems silly that I need to write the same 3 times
[13:41:47] <pototo> How would I go about checking if <div class="span8 offset2"> exists in my HTML body and replacing it with <div class="span10 offset1"> and vice versa?
[13:46:32] <BinaryKitten> pototo http://jsbin.com/onesaq/edit#javascript
[13:46:36] <BinaryKitten> that's how
[13:46:47] <BinaryKitten> you don't actually replace it, you just change the classes
[13:47:51] <codepython777> When the user clicks an icon on my page, I need to show a menu of items, where each item has three buttons. How can I do this? I already have jquery. So dont mind using it.
[13:48:39] <pototo> @BinaryKitten thanks! does this also work for toggling from span10 offset1 to span8 offset2?
[13:48:57] <BinaryKitten> no
[13:49:30] <BinaryKitten> it just makes all divs with span8 offset2 become divs with span10 offset1
[13:49:44] <BinaryKitten> but you can see how that's done, you can make it do the reverse
[13:50:16] <pototo> awesome, thanks for the help

[13:54:54] <BinaryKitten> np
[13:55:02] <BinaryKitten> pototo
[13:55:15] <BinaryKitten> are you really wanting to target all of the divs like that?
[13:55:33] <pototo> there is only one of those divs per page
[13:55:33] <anli__> Is anyone here developer of fckeditor?
[13:55:40] <BinaryKitten> because if you're just trying to collapse a sidebar, then give that an ID
[13:55:40] <NoiseEee> innociv: /(\d+.?\d+?)(px|em|%)?/.exec(yourString);
[13:55:43] <BinaryKitten> and target it properly
[13:55:48] <innociv> Oh that fails for.. yeah ?s
[13:55:49] <avalarion> Is someone able to tell me why I get a toLowerCase Error after only including jquery? http://scriptor.bbnetz.eu/bb.scriptor/login/index
[13:56:09] <pototo> it's only for changing the width of the body in Bootstrap
[13:56:13] <innociv> Thanks again
[13:56:45] <pototo> should I still use an ID?
[13:57:10] <vandunk> I'm trying to use $.post to save a css value that is changed when a button is clicked. I need to save it so that when a new page is loaded the object stays the same colour. I currently have: $.post("colour.php", { ccolour : "colour" }, function(data){ alert(data); } ); Can anyone help me with what I would put in the colour.php file?
[13:57:13] <BinaryKitten> pototo yes: http://jsbin.com/onesaq/2/edit
[13:57:17] <innociv> NoiseEee, that's null for '0'
[13:57:52] <BinaryKitten> vandunk sorry no, try asking in ##php
[13:58:06] <anli__> I am looking in the code for fckeditor, I can read lines like var textareas = document.getElementsByTagName( 'textarea' ) ;
[13:58:10] <vandunk> thanks
[13:58:18] <anli__> Why dont they use jquery, anyone that has an idea?
[13:58:32] <ChaosBringer> Quick question all: I'm using a jquery plugin located here (https://github.com/robcowie/jquery-stopwatch) I've debugged the hell out of it trying to find out why it is not working as expected. This is my pastebin http://pastebin.com/pjQg67VA
[13:58:32] <innociv> Without the last +? it seems fine
[13:58:49] <ChaosBringer> The error I am seeing is the following: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'elapsed' of undefined
[13:59:03] <ChaosBringer> However, as you look at the code, it should not throw that error.
[13:59:08] <sonotos> anli__: cause fckeditor is older as jquery if i remeber correct
[13:59:18] <pawn> complete callback for animate doesn't invoke if duration is 0
[13:59:21] <pawn> This a bug?
[13:59:32] <anli__> sonotos: But how can that be a reason :)
[13:59:45] <sonotos> but maybe they just didn't want to
[13:59:45] <anli__> Its not a read only project, is it
[13:59:55] <Kronuz> hello
[14:00:31] <sonotos> nobody rewrites a big working codebase without a very good reason
[14:01:01] <Kronuz> hey, if I have a div with several elements inside it, how can I remove elements to make my <div> have at most n elements in it?
[14:01:11] <Kronuz> what's the best way to do that?
[14:01:17] <pototo> @BinaryKitten Thanks, that works perfectly!
[14:01:39] <BinaryKitten> potato want to go one better?
[14:01:42] <shavedballs> hi
[14:01:53] <shavedballs> i have 2 buttons within a form
[14:02:03] <shavedballs> how can i tell which button is pressed
[14:02:12] <shavedballs> when i do a submit
[14:02:42] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs in js, you bind a click event to both and then you know
[14:03:04] <shavedballs> what do u mean binary
[14:03:17] <shavedballs> well the thing is this
[14:04:06] <shavedballs> i have a  $('form[name=shipForm]').submit(function (event) {
[14:04:14] <shavedballs> thats how i submit my form
[14:04:23] <shavedballs> i dont need to know clientside
[14:04:25] <shavedballs> i need to know on the server
[14:04:31] <shavedballs> which button was clicked
[14:04:56] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs that's beyond the scope of this channel
[14:05:09] <BinaryKitten> if you're using php try in ##php
[14:05:25] <BinaryKitten> if not, try one of the other channels for the language you are using on the server
[14:05:35] <shavedballs> no binary
[14:05:43] <shavedballs> dont u add a hidden field
[14:05:46] <shavedballs> with jquery
[14:05:52] <BinaryKitten> no you don't
[14:05:52] <silverwind> :/
[14:05:56] <shavedballs> i ve done it before but i forgot how
[14:06:01] <silverwind> LAWLZ
[14:06:13] <BinaryKitten> pototo still here?
[14:06:42] <EvanDonovan> is there a support channel specifically for jPlayer? (i guess that's not technically a jQuery plugin)
[14:06:42] <pototo> @BinaryKitten Yes, sorry.
[14:06:44] <luciano_> hi guys
[14:06:47] <BinaryKitten> http://jsbin.com/onesaq/3/edit
[14:07:04] <BinaryKitten> potato that will allow you to call it many times on many different things
[14:07:10] <luciano_> i'm needing help to find an error in my simple jquery script, could someone help me?
[14:07:23] <innociv> Nevermind, that doesn't work
[14:07:34] <shavedballs> wait
[14:07:35] <BinaryKitten> luciano_ pastebin your code, and explain the issue
[14:07:45] <luciano_> ok, brb =)
[14:07:45] <shavedballs> can someone tell me how to add a hidden field
[14:07:47] <shavedballs> when i click on a button
[14:07:54] <innociv>  /(\d+.?\d+?)(px|em|%)?/.exec('50%'); gives me 50 and %, but /(\d+.?\d+?)(px|em|%)?/.exec('0'); doesn't work. Any ideas?
[14:08:12] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs you're doing it wrongâ„¢
[14:08:18] <shavedballs> why
[14:08:18] <david_mark> shavedballs: david_mark back?
[14:08:24] <pototo> @BinaryKitten Thanks!
[14:08:30] <innociv> I need to seperate numbers like 5 and 0.5 from px|em|%.
[14:08:37] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs try giving the the submit names
[14:08:44] <silverwind> innociv, parseInt
[14:08:47] <pototo> @BinaryKitten Do I have permission to use this in a site for a client?
[14:08:47] <innociv> No.
[14:08:47] <shavedballs> what do u mean
[14:08:56] <BinaryKitten> pototo sure
[14:09:00] <innociv> That only gives the number.
[14:09:02] <vandunk> So, is it possible to do this with jquery? I have a 4 pages with white backgrounds defined by a stylesheet, each has the same button which when clicked changes the css of the body to make the background black. So when I go to one of the other pages i need it to stay black, is that possible?
[14:09:13] <silverwind> Ahh
[14:09:14] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs <input type="submit" name="blah" />
[14:09:39] <BinaryKitten> vandunk try $.cookie (on google)
[14:09:49] <vandunk> an example is this website: http://www.milieugrotesque.com/
[14:09:53] <vandunk> okay, i'll have a look at that
[14:10:10] <vandunk> that website is using $.post, but i'm not quite sure how
[14:10:23] <pototo> Thanks!
[14:10:38] <innociv> vanduck, save the style change in localStorage or save it in a users settings on the server
[14:11:15] <BinaryKitten> vandunk we can only help you send it to the server
[14:11:31] <BinaryKitten> if you don't know how to get it back from there, thats something for another channel
[14:11:34] <shavedballs> ya
[14:11:36] <shavedballs> but
[14:11:43] <shavedballs> both buttons submit the same form
[14:11:52] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs and?
[14:12:02] <BinaryKitten> only 1 will be passed through
[14:12:03] <shavedballs> but i need to know which button submits the form
[14:12:17] <shavedballs> what do u mean
[14:12:22] <shavedballs> if i click the button rate
[14:12:28] <shavedballs> it will submit the form
[14:12:29] <shavedballs> if i click process
[14:12:34] <shavedballs> it will submit the same form
[14:12:35] <vandunk> BinaryKitten, i think i know how to get it back using php? but is localStorage recommended over the $.post method?
[14:12:37] <BinaryKitten> if you have 3 with differnet names, the button you click will have it's name in the data
[14:12:41] <shavedballs> how do i know which button clicked the form
[14:12:49] <BinaryKitten> localStorage is differnet
[14:12:57] <shavedballs> wha?
[14:12:58] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs check the data
[14:13:07] <shavedballs> what do u mean check the data
[14:13:15] <BinaryKitten> you get data on the server
[14:13:24] <shavedballs> ya
[14:13:30] <shavedballs> but i dont get which button was clicked
[14:13:31] <BinaryKitten> in that data there will be only 1 entry for 1 submit button
[14:13:35] <Sander^home> Hi. How do I add an link around this text: $("<td>").addClass("topic").text(value).appendTo(tr);
[14:14:03] <BinaryKitten> eg name="submit1", name="submit2"  if you click the 2nd one, in the data on the server only "submit2" will appear
[14:14:06] <nFFF> Hai guise, when a user clicks on an img (.png) with transparent background I need to check to see if theyve clicked on a transparent pixel or not, how do?
[14:14:07] <BinaryKitten> not "submit1"
[14:14:13] <Sander^home> I want an <a href="link">Value</a>
[14:14:25] <luciano_> guys, this is the code: http://pastebin.com/WbG4h9aa . the problem is that when i click the <a>, console returns an unexpected token ) at the beginning of my html and the first text() doesnt work. all of the following clicks work, but the same unexpected token error happens again
[14:14:33] <BinaryKitten> nFFF get the x/y coord from the click
[14:14:36] <innociv>  /(\d+.?\d+?)(px|em|%)?/.exec('50%'); gives me 50 and %, but /(\d+.?\d+?)(px|em|%)?/.exec('0'); doesn't work. Any ideas?  I'm trying to get the numerical values such as 50 and 0.5, and the type of vlaue such as px|em|%
[14:14:45] <vandunk> I think my question is, how is that website storing the css change and is it an advisable method?
[14:14:55] <BinaryKitten> nFFF then use canvas to load the image and process the coordinate
[14:15:17] * BinaryKitten returns to actually doing something useful
[14:15:21] <nFFF> BinaryKitten how would that know if its clicked on a transparent pixel?
[14:15:32] <BinaryKitten> nFFF look at the canvas api
[14:15:40] <BinaryKitten> it has the info for a pixel
[14:15:45] <BinaryKitten> or point
[14:16:30] <codepython777> any suggestions for a menu code? I need a simple menu drop down where each element could be some text in particular font + 3 buttons?
[14:17:20] <codepython777> http://media.wiley.com/Lux/34/308634.image1.jpg -- something like this is what i need?
[14:18:15] <codepython777> anyone know where i could start?
[14:18:35] <luciano_> you could use a $().toggle(); to show a 'display: none' menu, codepython777
[14:19:34] <codepython777> luciano_: but how do i make such a menu in the first place. Each element needs to have buttons and images etc.
[14:20:02] <codepython777> luciano_: I want my user to click an icon, then a drop down menu of such sort appears.
[14:20:10] <codepython777> Where the user can click buttons
[14:20:37] <luciano_> just do it as you would do if the menu was visible, then add a 'style='display: none'' at its div, codepython777
[14:20:58] <shavedballs_> i dont get it
[14:21:11] <luciano_> but you'll probably need to play with positions absolute and relative to position it when it's visible, codepython777
[14:21:11] <fubar10> Hey there guys. I have some questions on how to use the ajaxComplete function.
[14:21:13] <shavedballs_> when i do Request.form["Rate"] on the server side
[14:21:18] <shavedballs_> i get null
[14:21:25] <shavedballs_> i dotn think it is sending it
[14:21:32] <shavedballs_> because i am serializing my form
[14:21:41] <codepython777> luciano_: arent there any menu libraries that do this that i could use? or at least would help?
[14:21:51] <fubar10> I'm trying to check the urls' by using a reg-ex, but would like it to function even on data retrieved via ajax.
[14:21:53] <shavedballs_> $.post('StandardShip', serializeForm()
[14:22:07] <shavedballs_> function serializeForm() {         var form = $("#shipForm").serialize();         $('input[disabled], select[disabled]').each(function () {             form = form + '&' + $(this).attr('name') + '=' + $(this).val();         });         return form;     }
[14:22:10] <shavedballs_> which is that
[14:22:22] <shavedballs_> binarykitten: u see?
[14:22:39] <luciano_> well, it's a common issue, so there must be a lib to do so, codepython777 , but i don't know
[14:23:14] <luciano_> try googling 'drop down menu jquery' or something like that, codepython777
[14:23:21] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs_ don't past to channel like that
[14:23:36] <shavedballs_> do u see what im talkin bout
[14:23:37] <codepython777> luciano_: I can find drop down menus, but none that allow buttons and images and such as elements
[14:24:05] <BinaryKitten> no because your code/paste to channel got filtered from my screen
[14:24:44] <luciano_> well, if you can or not use images and such, is probably an issue with your html, not the menu lib, codepython777 . could you show me which lib you're using?
[14:24:49] <shavedballs_> well what do i do
[14:25:17] <codepython777> luciano_: I've not picked one yet. Trying to find one
[14:26:03] <luciano_> hmm, i really think you don't need one, codepython777 =) a dropdown menu is really easy do build from scratch, and it'1s a good exercise too
[14:27:26] <luciano_> but if you don't have the time, i think you'll need to find a proper lib. i didn't find one when i needed, so i built my onw, codepython777
[14:27:56] <BinaryKitten> also a drop down menu can be done without javascript
[14:28:01] <exalt> hee
[14:28:09] <luciano_> yep, BinaryKitten
[14:28:17] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: I need something like this: http://media.wiley.com/Lux/34/308634.image1.jpg
[14:28:21] <exalt> i use the html5 <header> tag, how can i make jquery assign it ?
[14:28:23] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: Any ideas what I could use?
[14:28:37] <BinaryKitten> yes
[14:28:44] <BinaryKitten> jquery tooltip codelahoma
[14:28:53] <BinaryKitten> * codepython777
[14:29:01] <BinaryKitten> or CSS
[14:29:16] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: link?
[14:29:26] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 google?
[14:29:26] <luciano_> BinaryKitten, could you help me with my code?
[14:29:30] <BinaryKitten> luciano_ no
[14:29:37] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: codelahoma?
[14:29:41] <codepython777> google didnt find it
[14:29:48] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 tab-complete error
[14:30:00] <BinaryKitten> luciano_ sorry am in the middle of a lot of somethings
[14:30:05] <fubar10> I'm trying to check the urls' by using a reg-ex, but would like it to function even on data retrieved via AJAX. What's the best way of going about doing this?
[14:30:11] <BinaryKitten> and just about maintaining mental cohesion
[14:30:25] <luciano_> ok, no prob, BinaryKitten, i'll try some more things =)
[14:30:40] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: And you can put buttons and pictures and menus in tooltips ? Which library?
[14:30:53] <BinaryKitten> jquery tooltip
[14:31:10] <BinaryKitten> there's also jquery tools  which have a tooltip
[14:31:22] <BinaryKitten> and jQTip which gives you a tooltip
[14:31:27] <BinaryKitten> and many many many many more
[14:31:39] <BinaryKitten> so don't tell me that you can't find it on google..
[14:31:43] <codepython777> How do you build a menu with buttons inside them?
[14:32:01] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 that's not a menu
[14:32:08] <codepython777> I did see some examples of them -- none even remotely close to this -- http://media.wiley.com/Lux/34/308634.image1.jpg
[14:32:24] <Salvager> I know how to get one piece of specific data with this http://pastebin.com/RDAkXTDK but is there some way to get a list of all available data? like some kind of var_dump ??
[14:32:30] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: when there are multiple friends requests, it drops down like a menu -- maybe its not
[14:32:34] <luciano_> codepython777, are you searching for anything like this? http://purecssmenu.com/
[14:32:49] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 that's a list inside a tooltip
[14:32:56] <BinaryKitten> it's all just hjtml
[14:33:17] <codepython777> and tool tips can scroll bars as well?
[14:33:35] <codepython777> just render a whole html with the correct width?
[14:34:04] <BinaryKitten> codepython all it is is a div with 1 part (the icon) floated left
[14:34:10] <BinaryKitten> then a main section below
[14:34:18] <BinaryKitten> which is shown on click or hover
[14:34:52] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: http://hyuz.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/gsh-1701.jpg
[14:35:17] <codepython777> luciano_: thanks
[14:35:26] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 and?
[14:35:35] <luciano_> no problem, codepython777 =)
[14:35:44] <codepython777> so just do this using a tooltip + html inside it?
[14:35:58] <BinaryKitten> codepython yes,
[14:36:08] <BinaryKitten> "tooltip" is just a nother fancy term
[14:36:13] <BinaryKitten> like "lightbox" etc
[14:36:16] <codepython777> is there an example of a list + tooltip somewhere?
[14:36:29] <BinaryKitten> codepython777 your image is one
[14:36:54] <Salvager> anyone?
[14:36:57] <BinaryKitten> facebook is really good for those things
[14:37:31] <codepython777> BinaryKitten: I'll try to do it using qtip, unless you've a better suggestion?
[14:37:36] * BinaryKitten leaves the computer as she feels like she's about to rage at people
[14:38:00] <shavedballs_> binarykitten
[14:38:08] <shavedballs_> i cant use names on the submit buttons
[14:38:13] <shavedballs_> because i use ajax post
[14:38:29] <shavedballs_> so how am i gonna get the button names?
[14:38:41] * BinaryKitten doesn't actually care
[14:38:54] * BinaryKitten feels the rage
[14:38:54] <codepython777> luciano_: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/#structure -- seems like the html structure for the tooltip is pretty rigid. You think i can still work a list inside it?
[14:40:07] <shavedballs_> what?
[14:40:19] <shavedballs_> binary where are u from
[14:40:29] <BinaryKitten> England
[14:41:54] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquery: jQuery 1.8 Beta 2 is now available, featuring improvements to Sizzle! http://t.co/kM4zsP6K â˜… http://bit.ly/NmlVb0
[14:42:25] <luciano_> i think you'1ll need to try the lib with your expected html, codepython777. theter's really no way to really know if it'll fit your needs or not =\ at first glance, it seems you'll have no problem using it with lists, but i can't say
[14:43:04] <shavedballs_> oh ok
[14:43:43] <shavedballs_> that place has nice people
[14:43:57] <shavedballs_> they walk fast tho
[14:44:25] <shavedballs_> do u walk fast
[14:45:53] <Salvager> is there anything like the php var_dump in jquery?
[14:46:25] <BinaryKitten> Salvager no, but there is console.dir
[14:46:55] <shavedballs_> binary are u at work?
[14:47:04] <Salvager> how does that work?
[14:47:16] <BinaryKitten> with firebug Salvager
[14:47:37] <BinaryKitten> console.dir is like console.log except it outputs all items in a list
[14:47:45] <BinaryKitten> ?g console api
[14:47:46] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, Console API - FirebugWiki - http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[14:47:55] <Salvager> ty
[14:48:09] <BinaryKitten> Salvager no worries
[14:48:27] <BinaryKitten> shavedballs_ at 22:48 i hope not
[14:50:32] <shavedballs_> damn tahts late
[14:50:54] <tw2113> that's late? that's not even 2am
[14:51:00] <tw2113> that's like 10pm
[14:51:55] <BinaryKitten> tw2113 when you have a 7am deployment pending meaning 5 am start
[14:52:01] <BinaryKitten> and 17:30 finish
[14:52:10] <BinaryKitten> 10pm is late
[14:52:23] <vandunk> Can anyone explain to me how this website is saving css values (they change when the buttons in the top right are clicked) when the page is refreshed using $.post?
[14:52:26] <vandunk> http://www.milieugrotesque.com/
[14:55:47] <fubar10> What's the best way to run jquery on ajax complete?
[14:56:20] <bwq> the best way?
[14:56:26] <bwq> not sure what you're trying to do
[14:56:59] <bwq> you mean you want to run a function on completion of the ajax call and do something with that data?
[14:57:02] <MistuhKurtz> so, i'm using hoverIntent on a drop down menu, and the "out" event is being triggered when I mouse over an element that's absolutely positioned over the drop down menu. Is there any way to prevent that before I rewrite the function generating the menu markup?
[14:57:16] <fubar10> bwq| Yes.
[14:57:25] <bwq> have a look at the $.ajax call
[14:57:42] <bwq> you can define a callback and use that to do stuff with the returned data from the ajax call
[14:58:49] <fubar10> bwq| What do you mean about callback an event?
[14:59:43] <bwq> it's a function you define
[15:00:04] <bwq> your ajax call will happen asynchronously and after it has completed, it will run that function
[15:00:31] <fubar10> bwq| I have the function pretty much written. Do you mind reviewing my code?
[15:00:44] <eip56> is there a function that allows me to dump whats in an object so i can see whats there. I am using the ajax method and i figured out how to filter data however i still want to see what alls in the object. basically looking for something similar to php's var_dump or print_r
[15:00:46] <bwq> sure
[15:01:30] <bwq> eip56: you can watch it in chrome's network monitor
[15:01:33] <bwq> or firebug on firefox
[15:01:42] <shavedballs_> binary when is ur bedtime?
[15:01:48] <bwq> it shows you the response of your call
[15:02:42] <eip56> thats bwq
[15:02:49] <eip56> thanks*
[15:02:52] <bwq> np

[15:05:41] <bwq> not really sure what that's supposed to do, fubar10
[15:06:04] <bwq> i've never seen a $.each in a $.ajax before :p
[15:06:58] <bwq> as the url, that is
[15:07:52] <fubar10> bwq| Hahah, I understand. What I'm trying to do is parse the page's html links. If it is either a jpg/png/gif, then set that attribute to the link. If it's a pdf, then add the "rel=external" attribute.
[15:09:49] <bwq> hmm
[15:09:55] <bwq> not sure what you need the ajax call for then
[15:10:03] <xboi209> is it possible i can use $(".foo").html("Hi").eq(0,1); or $(".foo").html("Hi").eq(0).eq(1); or something to select multiple classes?
[15:10:30] <bwq> i mean, you just want to parse the page for images and pdf and set the proper tags, right?
[15:10:53] <fubar10> Correct.
[15:11:38] <bwq> you could just do the a[href].each part then
[15:11:46] <bwq> to loop through the page and set the tags
[15:12:07] <fubar10> That works, but not if I navigate to another page via ajax.
[15:12:33] <bwq> oh, you want to attach it so it runs on every ajax call?
[15:12:37] <fubar10> Yes.
[15:12:43] <fubar10> I was hoping of doing something with .ajaxComplete, but it expects an event.
[15:13:09] <xboi209> guess no one can help :/
[15:14:53] <bwq> fubar10: a completed ajax call returns an event anyway, so you should just be able to use that function
[15:15:10] <pawn> how do I check a raido?
[15:15:12] <pawn> radio*
[15:15:36] <BinaryKitten> ?.attr @ pawn
[15:15:37] <bot-t> pawn, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[15:15:43] <fubar10> bwq| I see what you mean. So, instead of $.ajax, replace it with $.ajaxComplete($... ?
[15:15:52] <bwq> yup
[15:16:01] <bwq> i'd put the retagging code in a seperate function
[15:16:05] <xboi209> is it possible i can use $(".foo").html("Hi").eq(0,1); or $(".foo").html("Hi").eq(0).eq(1); or something to select multiple classes?
[15:16:08] <bwq> and then call that in the ajaxComplete function
[15:17:04] <fubar10> Thanks for the great help, bwq !
[15:17:06] <fubar10> bwq++
[15:17:08] <bwq> xboi209: you can use .class1, .class2 as selectors
[15:17:11] <bwq> np fubar10
[15:17:36] <BenLue> i have try an Turorial "Likes Google Navbar" http://www.webdevout.net/test?018. How can i make the Buttons with link to an Content? S3SYSTEM = /main.php FORUM = /forum.php etc and i have trouble with float:right (Anmeldung/Login) in css. Can anyone give me an example?
[15:17:52] <xboi209> bwq: but i have multiple classes with the same name
[15:17:53] <bwq> or you want to compare it wiht multiple vars?
[15:19:24] <bwq> not sure xboi209
[15:19:43] <bwq> what are you trying to do exactly?
[15:20:47] <xboi209> selecting the first and second class called foo
[15:22:15] <BFranks> I'm trying to get a theme switcher to show on all pages that support it.. I got it working, made a duplicate of the page, changed some non-JS components and now I get Object [object Object] has no method 'themeswitcher' on the same line # as $(function(){$('#switcher').themeswitcher();}); ??
[15:22:23] <bwq> ah
[15:22:29] <bwq> gotcha
[15:22:39] <bwq> $(".foo").slice(0,2)
[15:22:40] <bwq> try that
[15:23:04] <bwq> or just .slice(2)
[15:23:08] <bwq> that works too
[15:24:20] <xj54y__> Hey, I'm wondering if there's a way I can read from a file that is constantly being updated for real-time graphing (or close to it)
[15:24:30] <bwq> well, did you load the js of the themeswitcher?
[15:24:36] <bwq> else it won't be able to apply it
[15:27:36] <bwq> google for jquery streaming, xj54y__
[15:27:39] <bwq> or ajax streaming
[15:27:54] <xj54y__> streaming?
[15:27:55] <xj54y__> hmm
[15:28:46] <BFranks> bwq: Yeah it's the same line to load the themeswitchertool.inc in both pages.. (I did a save-as of the working page, changed the title, changed a table that was drawing with PHP, but didn't do anything to the JS.. and it's on the same server/same path as the working version.. So damned odd
[15:29:15] <BFranks> I'm tempted to save-as again and remove everything except JQuery, JQueryUI, and theme switcher..
[15:30:54] <bwq> xj54y__: yup, that's the term
[15:31:45] <bwq> did you update the table's id?
[15:31:57] <bwq> does the #switcher still exist?
[15:32:11] <xj54y__> bwq, any comprehensive sources I could refer to?
[15:32:24] <bwq> hmm, Object [object Object] has no method 'themeswitcher'
[15:32:25] <bwq> so it does exist
[15:33:51] <bwq> not sure xj54y__
[15:33:55] <bwq> haven't tried that before
[15:34:26] <bwq> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-stream/wiki/API#jQuery.stream()
[15:34:28] <bwq> try that
[15:35:02] <bwq> https://github.com/flowersinthesand/jquery-socket
[15:35:07] <bwq> apparently this is even better
[15:35:17] <avances123> hello, im just "completed" the demo of jquery-ui droppable demo
[15:35:23] <avances123> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#photo-manager
[15:35:38] <avances123> in here http://truequing.dyndns.org/barter/1/
[15:35:55] <avances123> can anyone help me?
[15:36:01] <avances123> is about where is stored the info of the trash boxes
[15:36:07] <avances123> to put into a POST
[15:36:13] <avances123> or any recommendation you have about how to send a list of  items to my app
[15:40:22] <Ox41> Alright, you guys HAVE to know
[15:40:39] <Ox41> I need a static page... that i can define an array in javascript...
[15:40:46] <Ox41> and allow a user to 'configure' their product
[15:40:53] <Ox41> Just a static page, no php or anything.
[15:41:12] <Ox41> I just want to show options. Choose one of these, choose any of these... choose one from this group or one from that group...
[15:41:39] <Ox41> Like a computer configuration page on Dell's website...
[15:42:05] <bwq> so you are talking about basic html?
[15:42:28] <Ox41> yup
[15:42:38] <Ox41> radio buttons, check boxes...
[15:42:44] <Ox41> I could PROBALY build it, but im lazy
[15:42:49] <Ox41> and hate duplicating effort :P
[15:43:36] <bwq> so what do you need jquery for?
[15:43:48] <Ox41> cuz jquery rocks...
[15:43:55] <Ox41> and I figured it would be something jquery would be good at
[15:43:58] <LakWork> getting chicks
[15:44:05] <Ox41> Manipulating DOM elements...
[15:44:09] <LakWork> that's what i use jQuery for
[15:44:22] <LakWork> it hasn't worked so far, but I haven't given up hope
[15:44:49] <bwq> you don't really need jQuery when you are working with static elements that never change
[15:45:04] <bwq> you can just use html selects, checkboxes etc. for that
[15:45:17] <Ox41> bwq: well my idea is there being like... a thing in the corner keeping a running total
[15:45:20] <Ox41> of monthly / one time charges
[15:45:28] <Ox41> OH yeah, this needs to be like a cellphone plan builder
[15:45:31] <Ox41> EXACTLY like that
[15:45:42] <bwq> oh i see
[15:45:48] <bwq> so option added/removed = update total cost
[15:46:04] <Ox41> yeah
[15:46:09] <Ox41> and it needs groups...
[15:46:18] <Ox41> If you choose this option, you can't have that option...
[15:46:23] <Ox41> i guess that would be radio buttons :P
[15:46:33] <Ox41> let me draw out the form and see what I really need
[15:46:33] <bwq> yeah :p
[15:46:37] <BFranks> bwq: Yeah #switcher didn't get pulled.. and saving a second copy of the working page, and stripping all the excess elements worked fine.. I wonder if something isn't generating some errors as the content loads in the main div.. ;p
[15:46:57] <bwq> BFranks: you are not checking for errors? :p
[15:47:32] <BFranks> bwq: I posted the object has no reference error? :)
[15:47:38] <BFranks> bwq: Same one
[15:47:44] <Ox41> BFranks: post life site!
[15:47:47] <Ox41> *live
[15:48:29] <BFranks> Annoyingly.. if it's the result of dumping from the data source a demo wouldn't help .. ;P
[15:50:48] <bwq> BFranks: oops, sorry
[15:51:01] <bwq> so a straight copy/paste gives you errors?
[15:56:52] <shoky> avances123: didn't understand your issue ?
[16:01:04] <BFranks> bwq: Neah .... I take the working page, save as.. works fine.. so now I'm going to transpose the data sources (mysql/php dumping to a table) and see when/where it breaks.
[16:02:07] <BFranks> Yup.. first PHP include botches it.. SO ODD
[16:03:33] <BFranks> The fuuuu... HAHAHA.. My PHP was calling some JS.. This is what I get for testing my includes standalone first
[16:04:53] <Mim> hello, I'm wondering why can't load a fb or twiter page in a simple iframe
[16:10:02] <LoneStar99> howdy folks
[16:10:34] <LoneStar99> when cursor is placed in textbox is that the "focus" event?
[16:10:49] <bwq> yes
[16:11:05] <bwq> and blur is when you leave it :)
[16:12:05] <granden> Any one who could help me a bit. http://jsfiddle.net/gRr3M/ got that, but I would like to change it a bit and make it work for un specified amount of images with the class bild. How would I do that?
[16:12:22] <LoneStar99> i have "search" as value in textbox when user places cursor in textbox I should use focus to remove the val() right?
[16:12:31] <shoky> Mim: because of https://developer.mozilla.org/en/The_X-FRAME-OPTIONS_response_header
[16:14:31] <granden> Anyone?
[16:15:04] <bwq> LoneStar99: why?
[16:15:23] <Mim> shoky : ok  thanks, so my only option is to use their APi's ?
[16:15:26] <bwq> you want to clear the "Search..." as soon as a user clicks the textbox, i guess?
[16:15:37] <bwq> just access the textbox directly and set the val to ""
[16:15:53] <bwq> hook to the onFocus event for that yup
[16:15:56] <shoky> Mim: i believe so. but i dont know much about it
[16:16:42] <shoky> granden didn't i answer an almost identical question of yours like.. yesterday?
[16:16:57] <Mim> shoky : ok  thanks
[16:20:11] <LoneStar99> bwq: let me jsfiddle, cuss my code has bugs...
[16:22:14] <granden> shoky: Yeah, but that was automaticlly. Trying to figuure out how to make that worknig with clicks. Perhaps I got it :)
[16:22:25] <shoky> granden: then why did you remove all the stuff i showed you
[16:22:32] <shoky> granden: you went back to coding dumb :P
[16:22:42] <granden> shoky: Haha
[16:22:56] <granden> My both scripts, this and that I showed you was made around the same time.
[16:22:56] <QiBala> /q mim
[16:22:59] <granden> A few weeks ago.
[16:24:01] <shoky> take this from yesterday http://jsfiddle.net/AZad4/  and use it as a template.. then just add your prev/next buttons, it should be clear what they need to do (the code in the fiddle is for moving it one slide forward...)
[16:26:09] <dinosaurbacon> I'm new to jquery and am using jquery tools form validation how do I put the validation message on the line below the input rather than next to it
[16:26:46] <dinosaurbacon> ?
[16:26:51] <granden> shoky: Will try!
[16:27:29] <dinosaurbacon> I'm new to jquery and am using jquery tools form validation how do I put the validation message on the line below the input rather than next to it?
[16:28:53] <dinosaurbacon> I'm new to jquery and am using jquery tools form validation how do I put the validation message on the line below the input rather than next to it?
[16:29:12] <zsoc> what's the functional difference between something like .load and using ajax for simple html changes?
[16:30:24] <granden> shoky: Perhaps I'm dump, but I dont get it, why does my simple changes not work, http://jsfiddle.net/gRr3M/1/
[16:32:37] <LoneStar99> bwq --> here is my code -->http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/5eqAb/
[16:32:49] <shoky> granden: click TidyUp button
[16:33:04] <shoky> granden: and also look at your console..
[16:34:01] <McC> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/zNEx5/
[16:34:13] <McC> granden: also, use .on() instead of .click()
[16:34:28] <shoky> McC: why?
[16:35:13] <McC> shoky: from what I understand all .click() is doing is calling .on('click',
[16:35:30] <McC> someone correct me if i'm wrong
[16:36:03] <LoneStar99> bwq nm i had accidently left some variable commented
[16:36:09] <granden> shoky: Thanks, think I solved it.
[16:36:40] <granden> now I just gotta have to replace the arrows, they need to be outside of that image-container div or they will get removed as well :)
[16:37:06] <nickSwe> can anyone tell me how to generate a list from a array with parent and childrens in Javascript/jQuery? I know how to do it in PHP but cant figure it out in javascript =/
[16:37:18] <nickSwe> my array looks like this: http://imagebin.org/220216
[16:37:20] <granden> McC: Thanks for the fiddle, but think I got it now acctually.
[16:37:55] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:38:16] <McC> granden: np
[16:38:49] <McC> Followup: on $.on() vs $.click() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8601482/jquery-on-vs-click-methods I guess it isn't a big deal, but I've been using $.on() since I heard about it
[16:41:30] <shoky> yap. no reason to recommend .on over .click to anyone. (unless you're recommending event delegation)
[16:41:58] <McC> yup, my bad
[17:09:56] <nicholasschulz> why don't jquery seem to take action when clicking the button up in left corner? works when i put the code into jsfiddle, so i think it has to be something wrong with the way i loaded the jquery files? frustratingâ€¦ http://bannaky.com/blog/
[17:13:26] <innociv> if( prop.valueType != 'undefined' ){ console.log(prop.valueType); } and it logs it as undefined.  Huh?
[17:16:04] <bsilvereagle> Does anyone know why '$(this).html('<b>huh</b><br /><i>huh</i>').fadeIn('slow',function(){});' isn't bolding or italicizing?
[17:19:40] <mfoxdogg|work> bsilvereagle: try putting the html in " " instead of  ' '
[17:19:49] <bsilvereagle> just tried that, no results
[17:20:58] <mfoxdogg|work> but you do get the Huh Huh ?
[17:21:08] <bsilvereagle> yeah
[17:21:12] <bsilvereagle> with both ' and "
[17:22:33] <mfoxdogg|work> i think you need to use escaped characters, try using &gt; and &lt; instead of < >
[17:22:44] <innociv> bsilvereagle, no idea try a jsfiddle
[17:24:02] <bsilvereagle> well I wrapped everything in a span with style=color:red and the red appears
[17:25:32] <bsilvereagle> heh, using &gt and &lt the html is displayed, and not interpreted.
[17:26:03] <bsilvereagle> innociv: the code is in a plugin handler and the plugin (radmenu) doesn't play well with jsfiddle
[17:26:40] <felipe_Brz> how can i select the input within $(this) ?
[17:26:47] <innociv> Maybe some code down to line is parsing out those tags.
[17:26:58] <innociv> try strong and em, or try not using the plugin
[17:27:16] <felipe_Brz> meaning: once i've captured a form, i'll have it inside $(this) but then how do I fetch the input that *in* $(this)?
[17:28:27] <bsilvereagle> nope strong and em aren't working either.
[17:28:32] <bsilvereagle> I'll try w/o the plugin
[17:30:04] <shoky> innociv: you are comparing prop.valueType to the string 'undefined'
[17:30:15] <mfoxdogg|work> felipe_Brz: $(this).find('input').val();
[17:30:29] <innociv> I thought the string still matches it
[17:30:47] <shoky> a string is a string
[17:30:57] <innociv> ?eval undefined == 'undefined' ? 'true' : 'false';
[17:30:59] <bot-t> innociv: "false"
[17:31:03] <innociv> Oh okay
[17:31:21] <shoky> maybe you meant to do  if ( typeof prop.valueType != 'undefined' )
[17:31:47] <shoky> as typeof results in a string
[17:33:50] <felipe_Brz> mfoxdogg|work:  thank you! ... never used that find() things before!
[17:36:17] <someprimetime> yo I want to make it so that when I'm dragging using the dragDrop API to keep the cursor as 'move' instead of the default looking icon. any idea how? i know I can change the icon image, but I want to keep the actual icon itself as move
[17:36:36] <someprimetime> $(this).css('cursor', 'move'); doesn't work in my dragstart event handler
[17:37:45] <bsilvereagle> mfoxdogg|work & innociv : if I do spans/divs/p 's I can modify all the properties I need with CSS. So I've got a working solution. Thanks for the help.
[17:42:14] <^Simon^> http://jsfiddle.net/ZTXHq/2/ - not sure if this is a jquery problem or javascript problem or a combination of the two. When you click one of the "Click here"s it alerts [object Object] instead of a number from 1 to 3.
[17:42:52] <^Simon^> I'm trying to set a similar function on each of the elements apart from the number that's alerted.
[17:43:56] <mfoxdogg|work> ^Simon^: events always return the object being clicked, you need to use whats in that object
[17:44:49] <mfoxdogg|work> and what that is doing is passing in the object under the name, idx
[17:45:11] <mfoxdogg|work> so take out the idx from the function and it should work
[17:45:47] <^Simon^> It almost does, but it then alerts "4"
[17:45:59] <^Simon^> which is the final value of idx after the loop is finished.
[17:46:20] <kaidez> trying to understand how mod builds work in jquery 1.8
[17:46:49] <kaidez> basically, it just builds off of github and excludes adding certian files to the build, correct?
[17:48:32] <^Simon^> mfoxdogg|work - thanks btw, it points me in the right direction even though it doesn't solve it completely. :)
[17:48:41] <mindtheory> hi everyone
[17:48:52] <mindtheory> when is it safe to access data()?
[17:49:10] <mindtheory> was trying in document.ready, but i'm getting undefined
[17:49:39] <coldhead> mindtheory: highly recommend reading http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[17:49:48] <coldhead> it explains how everything to do with data() works
[17:51:59] <mindtheory> coldhead: thanks
[17:54:29] <dilvie> ^Simon^: http://jsfiddle.net/pV6GJ/
[17:55:56] <^Simon^> dilvie - that's one way of doing it :) is there no way to use the value of idx (at the point the function is created) though?
[17:56:24] <dilvie> ^Simon^: Sure, but you can't just decide the call signature of the callback function. jQuery decides that for you.
[17:56:27] <someprimetime> how can I target all classes except for the first one appearing in the DOM?
[17:56:58] <someprimetime> e.g. target the second and third grid_12s but not the first <div class="grid_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="grid_12"></div></div></div>
[17:59:40] <dilvie> ^Simon^: http://jsfiddle.net/pV6GJ/1/
[18:00:03] <someprimetime> nvm
[18:00:11] <someprimetime> $('.grid_12').eq(1) seems to skip the first
[18:01:10] <kaidez> someprimetime: it should do that as things are loaded into an array
[18:01:13] <^Simon^> dilvie - of course! That makes perfect sense now. Thank you.
[18:01:30] <kaidez> so u may wanna try .eq(1) to target the first
[18:01:41] <dilvie> ^Simon^: No problem.
[18:01:49] <someprimetime> kaidez: word thx
[18:01:52] <someprimetime> got it
[18:02:04] <kaidez> sorry..meantt to write .eq(0)
[18:02:57] <dilvie> ^Simon^: That change is described pretty well in the documentation for .on() http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:03:17] <dilvie> ^Simon^: I used the optional data parameter, which gets attached to the event object as the .data member.
[18:03:45] <dilvie> In this case, I just passed the primitive value, but you could pass anything you want, including an object, or a function.
[18:04:29] * ^Simon^ nods, "I was just looking at it (again). We converted from .live() yesterday and I copied the one way of doing it from a different case to this one. The other case didn't require any parameters so it worked fine."
[18:05:13] <dilvie> .on is much better than .live. =)
[18:05:13] <david_mark> dilvie: kk
[18:05:16] <dilvie> Enjoy.
[18:05:25] <Duan> ?
[18:06:19] <kaidez> dilvie: isn't live in the path to deprecation?
[18:08:19] <AdamSewell> What's the best way to handle having multiple divs visibility being controlled by one or two checkboxes? This is sort of what I have thus far, http://pastie.org/4234844
[18:08:38] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/HD5zS/4/ In the bottom of the function "tween" $(el).css(prop.property, startVal);  that should set the selectors property to be the same as the "start" that is supplied, but it's not.  You have to move the scroll bar before they set.  I can't figure out why.  Looking at the console log, if you $("#foo, #bar").css("margin-top", 400); that sets them fine.
[18:09:48] <dilvie> kaidez: .live() is deprecated. Not on the path to deprecation.
[18:11:56] <kaidez> thx
[18:15:14] <faryshta> I am having issues with focus() and blur() http://pastebin.com/g2iFLA3z
[18:15:55] <faryshta> $("body").focus() doesn't execute the calls.
[18:17:02] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/HD5zS/4/ In the bottom of the function "tween" $(el).css(prop.property, startVal);  that should set the selectors property to be the same as the "start" that is supplied, but it's not.  You have to move the scroll bar before they set(from the updateTweens function calling).  I can't figure out why.  Looking at the console log, if you $("#foo, #bar").css("margin-top", 400); that sets them fine.
[18:17:03] <faryshta> Is there another way to execute a function when the window have focus? ($(window) doesn't work either).
[18:17:44] <innociv> I also tried calling updateTweens(); and that's not setting them.  They won't set before the scrollbar is moved, I don't get it.
[18:18:51] <innociv> But adding "$("#foo, #bar").css("margin-top", 400);" does work.  Yet $(el).css(prop.property, startVal); doesn't, when that's the same thing.
[18:28:23] <datarecal> hey guys
[18:28:31] <tw2113> and gals
[18:28:38] <datarecal> guys/gals :)
[18:28:49] <datarecal> with the jquery validor plugin is there a way to put the error on the label rather then the input ?
[18:28:51] <tw2113> and things
[18:28:54] <tw2113> can't forget the things
[18:34:50] <kborchers> datarecal you probably want the errorPlacement callback. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[18:37:45] <sinusss> hi everyone
[18:37:51] <sinusss> how come this is not working for me? var liInside = $('#text-template').clone().find('label').attr("for", this.get('field_name'));
[18:40:49] <rmurphey> sinusss: what is "this" at that point? or rather, what do you think it is?
[18:42:14] <rmurphey> also sinusss if you can clarify what part of it is "not working" ...
[18:42:25] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/HD5zS/9/ Just looking at the very end, the last function, why does the commented out "$("#foo, #bar").css("margin-top", 400);" set the css fine, but "$(el).css(prop.property, startVal);" doesn't?  Actually, I see that parseInt(startVal) works.  But if I do that, then '5.0' will be messed up.
[18:42:34] <innociv> Any simple ideas?
[18:42:48] <sinusss> rmurphey, let me rephrase my question. How do I "alter" the elements of the cloned DOM?
[18:43:12] <sinusss> Like if I have $('#text-template').clone().find('label').attr("id", '<uid>');
[18:43:27] <sinusss> Like if I have $('#text-template').clone().find('input').attr("id", '<uid>'); --> maybe more clear
[18:44:03] <sinusss> let me just pastie it... 30 seconds
[18:44:07] <rmurphey> sinusss: i can't recall what exactly will happen if you clone something that has an id, but i can imagine that might end badly if you intend to put it back in the DOM
[18:44:59] <sinusss> http://pastie.org/4234988 rmurphey
[18:45:32] <sinusss> i am just trying to clone something and then change some attributes then put it back in the dom
[18:45:57] <rmurphey> if you have multiple elements with the same ID in the dom ...
[18:46:00] <rmurphey> that is not going to end well
[18:46:23] <danzik17> sinusss: just curious, you're cloning #text-template - are you just trying to have an easy way of making multiples of the same element? ( the original being hidden or not in the DOM at all )
[18:46:34] <danzik17> the id of that element begs the question
[18:47:13] <sinusss> danzik17 yup - i am using <script type="text/template"> (will not get rendered)
[18:47:49] <rmurphey> sinusss: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/uTH9h/
[18:48:01] <danzik17> sinusss: clone is the wrong thing for this - use a templating library like underscore's _.template, or a mustache lib
[18:48:13] <rmurphey> remember that when you call .find() then you change your selection
[18:48:21] <rmurphey> so you end up appending the input or label that you found
[18:48:23] <rmurphey> not the template itself
[18:48:31] <rmurphey> also, what danzik17 said
[18:48:35] <rmurphey> use a templating library
[18:49:03] <sinusss> thanks i will get to Underscore when I understand more of this...
[18:52:11] <rmurphey> if the element with the id of text-template is a script tag, then you won't be able to find things inside of it like you're trying to do. see http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/hE4kn/1/
[18:55:25] <shoky> innociv: it's because startVal is a string
[18:55:56] <innociv> I got it.  Did a if( startVal.indexOf(".") != -1
[18:55:58] <sinusss> rmurphey thanks so much
[18:56:00] <innociv> then parseint.
[18:56:05] <sinusss> i think i have that problem
[18:56:15] <sinusss> i am just going to use a div then - then hide it
[18:56:33] <shoky> innociv: you can just use parseFloat :P
[18:57:18] <innociv> Good idea
[18:57:53] <shoky> or add + 'px'
[18:58:12] <innociv> adding px would create a problem for 0.5
[18:58:20] <shoky> would it?
[18:58:23] <innociv> In opacity
[18:58:32] <shoky> true dat
[18:58:44] <systemfault> Hi sexy!
[18:58:56] <shoky> me??? or rmurphey?
[18:59:06] <innociv> What i'm dealing with here is tweening all css numerical values.  That ranges from em, px, deg, %, 50, 5.0, etc
[18:59:17] <innociv> Seems covered now though
[18:59:43] <shoky> aye
[19:08:48] <datarecal> kborchers yeah i found that part but im trying to figure out how to append the error to the label cant figure out how to do that
[19:09:25] <datarecal> error.insertBefore(element); will insert it before the input but i want it just to the right of the label itself
[19:12:19] <kborchers> datarecal i assume your labels don't wrap your input correct?
[19:12:45] <datarecal> no
[19:13:01] <datarecal> <label for=address>address</label><input...
[19:13:41] <datarecal> so basically i want to change the html() of the label
[19:13:45] <coldhead> i hope the next jQuery has better support for <font>
[19:14:35] <kborchers> datarecal you might try something like element.prev("label").append(error);
[19:16:07] <raj> omg, I start work on monday, I need to finish this website
[19:16:16] <raj> hyperspeed mode
[19:16:31] <shoky> dr. raj
[19:16:37] * tw2113 hooks up an IV to raj's arm
[19:16:45] <tw2113> coffee drip ;)
[19:16:50] <raj> nice
[19:17:01] <raj> you used decaf you fool!
[19:17:34] <tw2113> how would you know.....unless you're a decaf drinker :O
[19:17:56] <systemfault> coldhead: You should try the <blink> plugin, it's soooo cool
[19:18:37] <coldhead> thanks systemfault, onto this now
[19:18:38] <systemfault> coldhead: You can even adjust the blinking rateâ€¦ what you couldn't do with the original <blink> tag
[19:20:31] <raj> how can I create `function myfunc()` to accept either a single element as an argument or no arguments?
[19:21:19] <shoky> you mean how do you check if something is an array?
[19:22:25] <shoky> ?isarray
[19:22:26] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[19:22:26] <raj> meaning, in python, I can define a function and do myfunc(something=somedefault) and therefore make something optional
[19:22:39] <raj> how can I make an optional argument
[19:22:41] <shoky> it's all optional in javascript
[19:22:55] <raj> oh, so how do i get ahold of the argument if it is passed?
[19:23:05] <shoky> arguments[0]
[19:23:12] <datarecal> kborchers that worked nicely but when i go : element.prev("label").append("<span class='error'>"+error+'</span>'); it shows it as an object
[19:23:34] <raj> oh, you mean I can call `myfunc()` if I define `function myfunc(someelement)` ?
[19:23:45] <raj> arguments[0] ?
[19:24:02] <shoky> that too, but you can also call foo(1,2,3)  if foo is:  function foo() { }
[19:24:03] <raj> arguments isn't a special word
[19:24:06] <shoky> it is
[19:24:30] <datarecal> ok i see i can just change it with css thanks kborchers
[19:24:55] <shoky> ?js function foo() { return arguments[2] }    foo( 'i','<3','raj' )
[19:24:57] <bot-t> shoky: "raj"
[19:25:20] <kborchers> datarecal that is because error is a jQuery object and yes css should be all you need. there are also errorElement and errorClass options that might help as well
[19:25:30] <raj> holy crap it is
[19:25:32] <raj> thanks shoky !
[19:25:52] <shoky> np :p
[19:26:08] <raj> my text editor (Gedit) doesn't make `arguments` orange
[19:26:12] <raj> or bold
[19:26:39] <tw2113> oh gedit
[19:26:44] <shoky> edit your syntax highlight config file ;P
[19:29:43] <raj> no idea how
[19:38:35] <shoky> oh it should be simple, sec
[19:42:37] <shoky> raj here its in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/javascript.lang
[19:45:22] <sinusss> anyone played around with backbone.js here?
[19:46:38] <coldhead> oui
[19:47:00] <coldhead> sinusss: https://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin
[19:47:05] <coldhead> that's the limits of my experience
[19:52:28] <juanojeda> hey guys, does anyone have a sec to have a look over some plugin code? http://jsbin.com/igedoy/edit#javascript,html,live
[19:54:02] <juanojeda> the issue I'm having is that each instance of the plugin overwrites the last, and as a result any events only affect the last instance
[19:56:23] <juanojeda> in other words, I can't figure out how to make my variables accessible to all methods of the plugin, while keeping them restricted to each element
[20:11:07] <Guest18623> Simple question, I'm using jQuery validate plugin, am trying to use $.valid(), it works within document.ready{} however when I try to use it in $(document).on("click") it gives me the error has no method 'validate'.  Suggestions?
[20:11:20] <sinusss> coldhead hmmm http://pastie.org/4235307 mine is not working. Line 88 is not calling line 15
[20:13:12] <rodd> eXoduz I'm not familiar with validate but, did you setup the plugin before the click event?
[20:13:25] <eXoduz> Yes I have setup the plugin before the click event.
[20:13:30] <eXoduz> Posting the code in jsfiddle, one moment.
[20:14:44] <eXoduz> http://jsfiddle.net/R76NN/
[20:15:29] <eXoduz> Error received when clicking the 'Add Recipe' button, is "TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'validate'".
[20:15:56] <eXoduz> Now if I move $('#submitRecipe').valid().submit(); into $(document).ready(function(){}); it validates on page load without any errors.
[20:17:47] <danzik17> sinusss: "this" probably isn't your backbone view.  change the "this" to "self" since you've already declared that above.
[20:19:38] <sinusss> danzik17 hmmm thanks. but still "add" is not called when I changed it to self
[20:19:40] <eXoduz> Any suggestions rodd?
[20:20:28] <rodd> eXoduz http://jsfiddle.net/R76NN/2/
[20:20:39] <rodd> eXoduz valid() returns a boolean
[20:21:22] <rodd> you should also prevent the default behavior in that click event, check whether the form is valid, then submit it in case it is
[20:21:41] <danzik17> sinusss: you sure there's stuff in that collection to iterate?  add some logging statements around the call to .add and see if they're called.  i'm also assuming this is free of syntax errors.
[20:22:22] <eXoduz> Hmm @rodd I'm still receiving TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'valid'
[20:22:58] <rodd> eXoduz I don't get that one
[20:23:13] <sinusss> danzik17 hmmm "item" outputs correctly - {"id":"2","memberlist_id":"3","field_name":"secret-name","field_label":"Your secret assassin name:","field_type":"text","field_description":"Keep you identity hidden!","parent_id":"0","weight":"1"}
[20:23:24] <rodd> eXoduz when does that error happen?
[20:23:29] <sinusss> no errors also
[20:23:42] <eXoduz> After clicking of the "Add New Recipe" button
[20:24:39] <rodd> eXoduz sure you are here? http://jsfiddle.net/R76NN/2/
[20:24:43] <sinusss> ahhh danzik17 event is "change" and not "add" - this.on('add'...) would not detect this correct?
[20:24:51] <eXoduz> It doesn't do it on the fiddle but does it on my live example..
[20:24:57] <rodd> eXoduz I couldn't reproduce it
[20:25:01] <rodd> I see
[20:25:30] <rodd> wheres your live example?
[20:26:09] <danzik17> sinusss: if it's the wrong event it wouldn't - dunno backbone events off the top of my head.  so the loop is working fine then, your event handler just isn't working.
[20:28:21] <raj> thanks shoky, added `arguments`
[20:28:29] <sinusss> danzik17 thanks it works here now: http://pastie.org/4235307 I changed to this.on('change'...
[20:28:59] <sinusss> it's always good to talk to someone... few people in #documentcloud  :/
[20:29:26] <sinusss> this.on('add'..) updated to this.on('change'...)
[20:40:22] <pneftali> hi guys - what's the shortest way of using ajax if i just want a specific page to load ? specifically, i just want to load /logout url.
[20:41:42] <someprimetime> ?load @pneftali
[20:41:43] <bot-t> pneftali, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:42:51] <pneftali> someprimetime: i don't have a target element
[21:03:03] <pandu101> hi all. im trying to figure out the 500 error im getting while making ajax calls. do u have any advice on how I get more specific info about this error? can chrome help with this?
[21:29:04] <tash> interesting, I'm using a jq plugin called DataTables, and in the rows of my table there is a checkbox ( every row has one ).  On click, or shall I say when you check it, I'm executing stuff.  For easy of explanation, say I'm doing alert("you checked me");  Well, if there is more than 1 page in my DataTable only the checkboxes on the first page work.
[21:29:48] <tash> if I click on Next to see the rest of the results and then check a box, nothing happens ... is only the first page loaded in the DOM, thus the checkboxes on the second page won't work?
[21:30:32] <tash> I suppose firebug can answer this for me.
[21:33:42] <tash> well, it seems like it is
[21:37:45] <tash> yeah, so if the my datatable is paginated, only the checkboxes on the first page allow me to actually use a selector and execute something
[21:38:06] <tash> $( ".schedule-item :checkbox[checked!=checked]" ).click(function( e )
[21:38:57] <tash> so, using the class selectory to find checkboxes that aren't checked, and when I click them, I can do whatever ... anyone have any ideas?
[21:45:15] <LoneStar99> hello folks
[21:45:57] <raj> Can I officially add to the DOM element with $somelement.data() by doing $somelement.data()['somekey'] = value ? instead of $someelement.data('somekey', value)
[21:47:50] <tash> LoneStar99: hi
[21:47:52] <LoneStar99> trying to get my code to remove text on textbox focus and if anything is written on blur and focus once again the written text appears..
[21:47:57] <LoneStar99> howdy tash
[21:48:06] <LoneStar99> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/5eqAb/2/
[21:53:17] <jonkersjoe> LoneStar99 : what's ee ?
[21:54:21] <jonkersjoe> I think your issue is with ee
[21:54:24] <raj> well it works, but I don't know if there are side effects
[21:57:35] <LoneStar99> jonkersjoe:  sorry missed that --> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/5eqAb/3/
[21:58:28] <LoneStar99> everything works until i write somehing --> blur and return to focus the text box goes blank
[21:59:34] <LoneStar99> i guess problem is in the blur function....
[22:00:04] <jonkersjoe> yeah it is, what do you want to do in blur ? if it is empty place back dtext, if not do nothing ?
[22:01:21] <LoneStar99> if empty place back "dtext"  if not empty and not equal to dtext then leave text alone...
[22:02:08] <Whirl3d> lonestar99, you can't use html5?
[22:03:03] <jonkersjoe> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/5eqAb/4/
[22:03:14] <LoneStar99> if users writes "blue cheese stinks" but then decides to append "blue cheese recipes" do not want the entire text to dissappear on focus
[22:03:30] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: html5 yeah why not... why do you ask?
[22:03:55] <Whirl3d> just add the placeholder tag to your input  like <input placeholder='something'/>
[22:04:10] <Whirl3d> then get rid of all that jquery stuff and you should be good to go
[22:04:29] <tw2113> use modernizr to test for placeholder support
[22:04:45] <Whirl3d> the placeholder attribute in html5 replaces any empty values with the placeholder value...it rocks
[22:05:14] <jonkersjoe> Yeah it does I'd use html5
[22:05:44] <Whirl3d> and like tw2113 says, if you are not relying on html5 only, use modernizer
[22:05:47] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d:  sweet, yeah to much code in jquery for something simple... let me do a hwdy search
[22:06:30] <Whirl3d> hwdy search?
[22:06:54] <jonkersjoe> how to ?
[22:07:16] <tw2113> i wonder when jsfiddle will throw in modernizr
[22:07:46] <tash1> any of you used DataTables?
[22:07:49] <Whirl3d> it's easy to add yourself...I think they should let you save your own presets for it.
[22:08:17] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d:  oh yeah sorry http://hwdy.in
[22:08:38] <LoneStar99> under development
[22:08:54] <jonkersjoe> hmmm interesting
[22:09:00] <Whirl3d> sounds cute. They could use a designer, though
[22:10:16] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: yeah it is all in the works
[22:10:43] <jonkersjoe> LoneStar99 is that what you're working on?
[22:11:03] <LoneStar99> jonkersjoe:  yeah kinda...
[22:18:38] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: so modernizer is good for nicer UI stuff?
[22:19:12] <tw2113> no
[22:19:16] <tw2113> it's feature detection
[22:19:35] <coldhead> i was chewing gum / for something to do
[22:19:50] <jonkersjoe> LoneStar99: http://modernizr.com/
[22:20:15] <LoneStar99> jonkersjoe: yeah checking it out
[22:20:19] <LoneStar99> out
[22:22:29] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d:  if I want to change color of only placeholder and not any value entered  i can do with jquery?
[22:23:32] <Whirl3d> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/%3a-moz-placeholder
[22:26:04] <Whirl3d> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/style-placeholder-text/
[22:26:19] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: ok, cool waz just gona ask that
[22:26:21] <LoneStar99> thanks
[22:27:57] <coldhead> LoneStar99: its nice if you can just add/remove a class with jQuery
[22:28:09] <coldhead> and leave the actual color stuff to a stylesheet
[22:28:43] <Whirl3d> so capture the blur event, check the value of the field, apply a class if empty. Capture the focus event and remove the class
[22:30:28] <LoneStar99> i had 150+ lines that placeholder replaced....
[22:31:55] <coldhead> gross
[22:32:04] <LoneStar99> yeah
[22:32:06] <LoneStar99> lol
[22:32:25] <LoneStar99> cuss i had multiple input boxes
[22:38:23] <Whirl3d> Cool. I just figured out how to blank the placeholder text when the input element is focused: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5eqAb/16/
[22:40:52] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: sweet cool
[22:40:59] <LoneStar99> working on that now
[22:55:20] <LoneStar99> i was reading on the adobe website, that javascript sucks for large scale websites, is there some truth to that?
[22:56:48] <LoneStar99> and that javascript should be rendered by a low level language like C or Java??
[23:02:41] <granden> How would I compare 2 divs, and see which one is higher then the other?
[23:03:55] <DanHerp> I'm having trouble with using "success" on ajax http://pastie.org/private/qjcut7awudbjfm4i5o3w
[23:04:02] <DanHerp> I can't get addClass to work
[23:05:04] <codepython7771> how do i get a tooltip with html inside it?
[23:05:14] <codepython7771> This seems to tell me that i can only have text in there: http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/index.html
[23:12:17] <Whirl3d> LoneStar99, here's some more fun functionality for input's including support for sylized default values http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5eqAb/34/
[23:18:02] <Whirl3d> granden, compare their offset top values....function higher (diva,divb) { var topa=diva.offset().top; var topb=divb.offset().top; return Math.min(topa, topb)==topa?diva:divb;}
[23:20:03] <Whirl3d> DanHerp, add an error handler to your ajax call like your sucess handler and log the results. Chances are you aren't preparing your data correcctly and therefore aren't getting the success handler to fire.
[23:20:29] <DanHerp> I actually had a success alert there and it was working
[23:20:35] <DanHerp> I've confirmed on the server that it works
[23:20:48] <Whirl3d> codepython7771, find a different tooltip plugin if that one doesn't do what you want.
[23:20:53] <DanHerp> it's just a cosmetic thing, trying to change the appearance
[23:21:10] <Whirl3d> then change $(this) to a variable reference to the thing you want to change
[23:21:28] <DanHerp> Sorry, I did that too.
[23:21:36] <DanHerp> I'll keep looking at it
[23:21:54] <Whirl3d> right after click (function (e) { var btn=$(this);   then in your ajax success, btn.addClass("whatever");
[23:22:42] <DanHerp> Hmm, okay
[23:23:16] <Whirl3d> store a reference to the clicked button in a variable that you can use in the sucess handler to add the class to, basically
[23:52:52] <Whirl3d> Okay, I can't keep my eyes open any longer. I'm gonna nap. Have a good one y'all.
