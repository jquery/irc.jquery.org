[00:00:21] <anew> same thing isnt it? you added documnet.ready only right?
[00:03:20] <zhulikas> yes
[00:04:44] <anew> img slide not loaded, requeuing slideshow: ok getting that in the console
[00:04:46] <anew> for some reason
[00:04:59] <anew> so getting closer... not sure why that error is there on my site, but it is not on ur jfiddle
[00:04:59] <karstenk1977_> Good morning!  Who is using jQuery Tools?
[00:06:23] <zhulikas> anew, check order of imported libraries
[00:07:38] <anew> i have the plugin loading before jq
[00:08:17] <karstenk1977_> I have a problem with tools tooltip
[00:08:31] <karstenk1977_> someone use it too?
[00:09:14] <tasslehoff> using jquery.form, what is the proper way to get to the form input values in beforeSubmit. it feels wrong to do stuff like: arguments[0][0].value.name
[00:09:37] * tasslehoff has been using jQuery for ~1 hour :)a
[00:12:18] <zhulikas> tasslehoff, there is nothing wrong with feeling there is something wrong when using jQuery :P
[00:12:43] <tasslehoff> zhulikas: that is ... maybe good to know :)
[00:13:04] <zhulikas> I always worry about microoptimizations because jQuery just doesn't look effective in some cases
[00:13:10] <zhulikas> especially when I need to do repetitive actions on something
[00:13:25] <zhulikas> that makes me want to introduce some internal caching to jQuery hehe
[00:15:20] <darroNZ> tasslehoff: have you used serializeArray? http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[00:16:37] <tasslehoff> darroNZ: no, but that seems useful. thanks.
[00:42:23] <GoSox> So I keep googling for some example code for how to make a Facebook style search box, where the results pop up in a menu, and it disappears when you click off of it, etc. But all I can seem to find are pre made search plugins, when what i really want is to build my own, i just need a places to start
[00:52:35] <zhulikas> GoSox, jquery + autocomplete + ajax
[01:14:44] <berserkr> Hi everybody. I have a question about jquery ajax function. What is the requirement for an ajax request to return success() or error() ?? I suppose that, in case of success() should be that the return code >= 200 and <=399 and timeout no expired. Anyone can confirm that?
[01:16:42] <sanjayb> berserkr: I *think* that's it, yes. codes of 404, 500 would definitely be "error()" ...
[01:17:40] <berserkr> sanjayb:  i'm reviewing the code, and I found this: if ( status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304 ) {
[01:18:00] <sanjayb> berserkr: ah! good to know :) - that seems to be it, then ...
[01:19:31] <berserkr> uhmm is strange. I think that redirection codes shouldn't return an error ;\
[01:25:13] <berserkr> but after all, I think that this way is better, yep
[01:26:16] <grek2> hy why this dont work $(this).parents(".ui-dialog:first").dialog("close");
[01:26:45] <grek2> dialog is atasched to other element ? how to firnd in witch dialog is this button
[01:27:09] <granden> Hi, got something wrong with this piece of code, http://pastebin.com/w1RQdiSe for some reason it does not wait 10 seconds until itt redirects it does it immediatley
[01:27:11] <grek2> $(this) is button inside dialog
[01:27:41] <zhulikas> granden, use setTimeout
[01:38:34] <sh0ne> how can I call this kind of function "$('[data-btn="viewcomments"]').click(function(e){...}" from another function?
[01:39:53] <grek2> function a() {  $('[data-btn="viewcomments"]').click(function(e){...} } ; a();
[01:39:54] <grek2> :
[01:39:55] <grek2> ?
[01:42:06] <NielsNL> try $('[data-btn="viewcomments"]').click();  <= i have seen someone mention it;)
[01:46:48] <sh0ne> grek2, NielsNL: thank you very much, guys, its just what I need :)
[01:49:53] <tasslehoff> when a login fails my server returns 401. this invokes the error-callback in my ajaxForm. how do I get hold of the responseText there?
[01:52:14] <granden> zhulikas: Thanks!
[01:52:33] <zhulikas> np
[01:55:14] <stenno> good day, i need to select elements by classes, but i only get them as a string like "foo bar". so for example, i have a div, and one of its children has the classes "foo" and "bar". what would be the most convenient way in jquery to query that? i know i could always do something like splitting that string
[01:55:53] <MrTrick> as in, you want the elements with both the foo and the bar class?
[01:55:58] <stenno> exact
[01:56:20] <stenno> i only have the classes as a single string though, so "foo bar"
[01:57:14] <zhulikas> Array.prototype.concat.apply([], classes.split(' ').map(function (c) { return $(c); }));
[01:57:16] <zhulikas> what about this?
[01:57:36] <zhulikas> maybe .map($) may work, but not necessarily
[01:57:42] <stenno> yeah as i pointed out, i could always split that stirng ... i was just hoping for a more convenient method
[01:57:49] <zhulikas> hehe :)
[01:57:57] <zhulikas> well, it's either you or jquery who does that
[01:57:59] <zhulikas> so what's the difference?
[01:58:05] <zhulikas> by doing it yourself you gain more control
[01:58:13] <stenno> that is true
[01:58:22] <MrTrick> how about $('.foo.bar') ?
[01:58:33] <stenno> i only have "foo bar"
[01:58:35] <zhulikas> I don't believe that would match it...
[01:58:39] <stenno> not ".foo.bar"
[01:58:55] <zhulikas> more like 'foo||bar' but I doubt that's possible ;)
[01:59:07] <MrTrick> what do you mean you have foo bar? Is the element defined like: <div class="foo bar"> </div>?
[01:59:09] <stenno> .foo.bar would mach
[01:59:19] <stenno> MrTrick, yes, just a second please
[02:00:19] <stenno> i pass the class as an event argument, and i get those by $(myelem).attr("class"). this returns "foo bar"
[02:00:54] <zhulikas> then just map returned value to something else
[02:01:01] <stenno> yes
[02:01:13] <zhulikas> dude, don't overcomplicate it, a simple string parsing will do it :)
[02:01:16] <stenno> i will split by " "
[02:01:37] <MrTrick> http://jsfiddle.net/ynqwP/
[02:02:05] <zhulikas> and that's wrong
[02:02:06] <zhulikas> :D
[02:02:06] <stenno> MrTrick, sorry you seem to have missed the actual question :)
[02:02:14] <MrTrick> I think so.
[02:02:17] <zhulikas> first two divs should contain HOORAY too
[02:02:31] <MrTrick> you want to OR them, not AND them?
[02:02:36] <stenno> i want AND
[02:02:40] <stenno> BUT please
[02:02:48] <zhulikas> hey,
[02:02:49] <zhulikas> $('.foo,.bar').html("HOORAY");
[02:02:51] <zhulikas> this works
[02:02:52] <zhulikas> :D
[02:02:58] <MrTrick> yes, yes it does.
[02:03:14] <stenno> the only question really was, how can i make "foo bar" to something i can select
[02:03:27] <benj3> why cant you select foo and bar?
[02:03:28] <stenno> i cannot just do $("foo bar")
[02:03:40] <MrTrick> And console.log( '.' + "foo bar".spit(' ').join(',.') )    will give you that.
[02:03:41] <stenno> the question was if there was a convenient way to make "foo bar"
[02:03:46] <stenno> yes
[02:03:46] <stenno> yes
[02:03:57] <stenno> as i pointed out first, i knew i could just split that string
[02:04:17] <stenno> i was just hoping there was a convenience method which lets me select elements by a class string like that
[02:04:33] <zhulikas> "foo bar".split(' ').map(function (c) { return '.'+c; }).join();
[02:04:33] <zhulikas> ".foo,.bar"
[02:04:34] <MrTrick> You have to put the . at the beginning, because the selector $("foo bar") will return tags that are <foo> AND that are <bar>. Which isn't what you want.
[02:04:38] <stenno> which there obviously isn't
[02:04:41] <stenno> i know!!!
[02:04:42] <blowsie> Does anyone know how to use .off() on a single element when the .on() has been applied to a group of elements? see this . http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796207/using-one-with-live-jquery
[02:04:47] <zhulikas> :DDD
[02:04:48] <stenno> sigh
[02:05:04] <zhulikas> stenno, apparenlty there isn't!
[02:05:15] <stenno> <stenno> which there obviously isn't
[02:05:16] <stenno> yes
[02:05:18] <benj3> ^ :x apart from ofc spliting
[02:05:32] <zhulikas> jeez that's a one-liner
[02:05:33] <stenno> fine, so i will just split :) thanks for the input, everyone
[02:05:35] <zhulikas> :D
[02:05:38] <stenno> :P
[02:05:40] <zhulikas> yeah, just split
[02:05:43] <benj3> :D
[02:05:49] <zhulikas> this is javascript after all
[02:05:54] <zhulikas> don't be afraid to get your hands dirty :P
[02:06:02] <zhulikas> and your conciousnes dirty
[02:06:14] <stenno> hihi
[02:06:15] <zhulikas> for using javascript in the first place :D
[02:06:20] <stenno> javascript is nice
[02:06:34] <zhulikas> it's ok.
[02:08:03] <benj3> I have a question now, Im trying to apply a delay to the amount of times a KeyUp function can be clicked ive tried http://pastebin.com/1rqLVFKL but this adds a delay to the function within it and ive also tried http://pastebin.com/1HKMs16a and this does nothing :< any help is appreciated
[02:08:28] <blowsie> Does anyone know how to use .off() on a single element when the .on() has been applied to a group of elements? see this . http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796207/using-one-with-live-jquery
[02:08:48] <tasslehoff> bah. on Chrome/FF I could get to xhr.responseText, but on IE that field is not there.
[02:09:07] <greek> Hi fellas. I have a <tr id='myrow'> with numerous <td> cells. Each <td> cell contains a <input type='hidden' class='code' value='...' />. I would like to hide all <td>s whose hidden code is X, and display all <td>s whose hidden code is Y. I now how to show / hide with .css(...), but I'm not sure about how to carry out this desired jQuery instruction. Thanks
[02:10:03] <benj3> .hide() / .show() ?
[02:10:46] <MrTrick> benj3: use underscore.
[02:11:00] <MrTrick> (one sec, let me find the specific function I'm looking for)
[02:11:11] <MrTrick> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#throttle
[02:11:28] <zhulikas> heh
[02:11:36] * zhulikas invented half of the functions defined in _underscore
[02:11:50] <zhulikas> up until I found out about that library
[02:12:39] <benj3> haha, :D thank you very much MrTrick
[02:12:50] <benj3> this Library looks intense! :D
[02:15:24] <benj3> MrTrick what would be the better option, LoDash or Underscore?!
[02:15:38] <blowsie> Does anyone know how to do the equivlant of .one() on a dynamically added element? http://jsfiddle.net/T3fMh/
[02:17:34] <MrTrick> Haven't used it. It claims to be faster and fix bugs that underscore has. Not sure how much faster, or which ones it fixes (or which ones it introduces itself ;-) )
[02:18:02] <benj3> :D alrighty, thanks :)
[02:18:09] <zhulikas> anyone using typescript lately?
[02:20:19] <seutje> MrTrick, benj3: if ur using jQuery anyway http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ miht be useful
[02:20:24] <seutje> might
[02:22:18] <benj3> ah oky ty will take a look.
[02:31:28] <blowsie> oes anyone know how to do the equivlant of .one() on a dynamically added element? http://jsfiddle.net/T3fMh/
[02:38:43] <jaydev> hello
[02:40:40] <NielsNL> blowsie: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/aZqPk/
[02:52:48] <jammanbo> Would i be right in thinking that if you addClass which triggers substantial changes in the CSS that is being applied, that the browser might not have finished rendering the new changes by the time the next line of script runs?
[02:53:53] <jammanbo> Or more specifically, that the offsets of elements in the DOM might still be in flux when the next statement runs.
[02:56:03] <danmichel> Hey guys, I'm trying to simply change my image links on hover and this doesn't seem to be working http://pastie.org/5417519
[02:58:11] <tasslehoff> This seems to work in all browsers but IE http://pastebin.com/YcHRG1NW. I'd appreciate if it someone could tell me why :)
[03:11:09] <blowsie> @NielsNL yes like that but working. Your example doesnt work, any thoughts? I made a function to make it only trigger once but the events are still happening http://jsfiddle.net/T3fMh/3/
[03:13:15] <seutje> blowsie: the handlerobject will still be the button, won't it?
[03:13:53] <blowsie> the handlerObj is the method / function that called it
[03:14:34] <seutje> are you trying to log when injecting new content?
[03:15:40] <seutje> if so, just log when injecting the content or look into mutation observers
[03:16:02] <d8bhatta> Hello, please  have a look at http://www.uncorked.com/. If you move mouse fastly on first menu "Shop Wines", brand menu expands but  brands child menus doesn't disappear as mouse moves to another menu. I have used jquery hide but it does't work if we move mouse fastly
[03:19:33] <d8bhatta> please suggest
[03:23:11] <d8bhatta> Well, let me be specific. Why jquery .hide() doesn't work when mouse is moved fast over menu
[03:23:48] <SantaPoG>  d8bhatta, im not seeing that behaviour
[03:24:07] <SantaPoG> what i am seeing is sometimes the first column of the pop out menu doesnt show
[03:28:09] <d8bhatta> SantaPoG:  yes, first column disappears and only three columns remain there , actuallly those three columns should also disappear when  mouse moved to third menus vertically
[03:29:03] <anew> i fixed it, must be some weird way i'm creating the dom - is there a problem using $(window).load over $(document).ready ?
[03:32:19] <d8bhatta> anew:  is this for me?
[03:32:41] <d8bhatta> ^
[03:33:13] <anew> anyone who would like to take a stab at the answer lol XD... i fixed my problem by using .load instead of .ready.... just dont know what the consequences are
[03:33:50] <d8bhatta> ohh..i see.
[03:33:51] <d8bhatta> sorry
[03:34:29] <anew> what do u think
[03:34:35] <benj3> Is there a way to set a delay between each keyup function so someone can just spam a key. I.E. I have a slider that will go to the next slide when I press the arrow key but i only want it to be allowed to trigger once every lets say second instead of how ever fast u can press it.
[03:34:46] <benj3> cant just spam the key*
[03:34:47] <d8bhatta> SantaPoG: any thoughts, why those three columns are not hiding with .hide?
[03:35:56] <anew> d8batta let me see what u have
[03:37:00] <d8bhatta> anew: appreciated!
[03:38:34] <anew> d8bhatta i need the link again
[03:39:44] <benj3> d8bhatta why are you not initially hiding them via CSS first?
[03:41:06] <d8bhatta> benj3: does it make any difference if we hide it initially?
[03:41:35] <benj3> Well it seems to only display on my first initial hover
[03:41:44] <mvk> does anyone know why i get this annoying white block in IE8/9 in my page? > http://test4.intersoftware.nl/hypobox/functionaliteit.aspx
[03:41:51] <mvk> looks like it copies the div :S
[03:44:06] <d8bhatta> benj3: if there is problem with the code then it wouldn;t work if the mouse is moved slowly , like hover brand, then hover type (third menu). If you reach to third menus those pop up disappears correctly
[03:44:40] <d8bhatta> But it doesn't if mouse is moved fast across
[03:50:49] <benj3> good old magento dropdowns
[03:51:06] <benj3> those 4 cols custom or done via the magento menu?
[03:51:42] <Parsi> i have a problem, i'm using animate.css with jquery, effects does not work in firefox and chrome, but in safari
[03:57:56] <benj3> Is there a way to set a delay between each keyup function so someone can just spam a key. I.E. I have a slider that will go to the next slide when I press the arrow key but i only want it to be allowed to trigger once every lets say second instead of how ever fast u can press it?

[03:59:25] <geiregjo> Anyone here that combined jquery mobile with backbone before?
[03:59:47] <geiregjo> I got a working app which uses backbone it's router.
[04:00:32] <geiregjo> The thing is that when you open a popup in jquery mobile it updates the hash, but in order to use backbone it's router you have to prevent jquery mobile from listening to hash change events
[04:02:10] <geiregjo> Come on guys, anyone?
[04:02:22] <jaydev> ha anyone installed yeoman on windos7?
[04:02:36] <koopajah> benj3 > you could do it on your own if you remember the last time you handled a keyup and if it was less than 1sec before just dont do it ?

[04:12:46] <woozly> guys, how to load back css rule for element? If I append new .css() for it?
[04:12:53] <woozly> I want reset it to css
[04:15:22] * swe_ET created a plugin that has functions on prototype .. when callling .. it fires on all elements that are applied to
[04:19:17] <seutje> woozly: to remove inline styles, use .css('prop', '')
[04:19:25] <seutje> where prop is the property u wanna reset
[04:21:57] <darroNZ> jarr0dsz: try binding a listener to the bounds_changed event rather than the jquery document ready
[04:22:18] <jarr0dsz> darroNZ: how exactly do you mean? the bounds_changed event?
[04:23:51] <darroNZ> jarr0dsz: when the map has finished loading it fires a bounds_changed event
[04:24:11] <darroNZ> you can set a listener to that which then calls your other function
[04:24:35] <jarr0dsz> ok i see have to look into that, no idea how it works but its a good lead thx
[04:28:35] <iSeeDeadPixels> hey jquery people
[04:28:57] <darroNZ> jarr0dsz: I think you'd do something like $(document).on('bounds_changed', function() { // do something });
[04:29:56] <darroNZ> jarr0dsz: it's part of the google.maps.Map class
[04:30:08] <jarr0dsz> cool darroNZ i check that thx

[04:38:33] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://i.imgur.com/M43J0.png this is a 8x8 grid, the icons and text is a div, do i really have to change it to a list in order to be able to sort them, and move them around? outside of the grid there will be two droppables
[04:38:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> currently, they are draggable

[04:42:32] <r3v3rb> anyone knwo if its possible to pass the alt and title of an anchor to Fancybox to display as a title and caption?
[04:42:37] <r3v3rb> know*

[04:44:07] <iSeeDeadPixels> koopajah: not working on just divs.
[04:44:21] <iSeeDeadPixels> they're not a table or list, they're floated divs..
[04:44:52] <jh`> where can i ask jquery mobile question
[04:45:22] <r3v3rb> i'm using this but $(this) is return 'alt' as undefined : http://jsfiddle.net/DHG9t/
[04:48:55] <jh`> jquery mobile question: is it possible to set height for data-role=page div
[04:49:28] <jh`> things i tried worked on content div but not page div
[04:49:45] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-items
[04:50:14] <eshlox> how i can return url from something like this http://wklej.org/id/877082/ ?
[04:50:26] <Cork> eshlox: you can't
[04:50:30] <seutje> r3v3rb: there is no fancybox
[04:50:45] <Cork> eshlox: the callback happens after the function returns
[04:50:51] <Cork> so there won't ever be anything to return
[04:50:58] <slonik> return image_url?
[04:50:59] <r3v3rb> seutje: i just posted the code do you want a full example with libs?
[04:51:25] <Cork> slonik: data.data.url
[04:51:32] <slonik> oh, missed it
[04:51:34] <slonik> right
[04:52:30] <Cork> eshlox: btw you should define your variables
[04:52:32] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: it's still stacking :C
[04:52:44] <Cork> its a BAD idea to have a global variable like that
[04:52:50] <eshlox> hm
[04:53:08] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: it was a few years since i did it, but i know its doable
[04:53:18] <Cork> you have to change the selector though
[04:53:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> the divs should move instead of stack :/
[04:54:01] <Cork> eshlox: and if you don't see it image_url is global
[04:54:19] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: so set a class on the element that should
[04:54:29] <Cork> and give that to items
[04:54:57] <koopajah> iSeeDeadPixels > sortable() is not just for table, i use it for my own grid made of floating div
[04:55:10] <eshlox> Cork: ok, so var image_url, yes? ;-)
[04:55:45] <Cork> yes

[05:00:08] <mikunos1> is there a way to click in a TR of a Table and tick the corresponding checkbox? I have written here my code: http://pastie.org/5417963
[05:03:22] <eshlox> Cork: ok, is there any solution for this? i need function which returns getjson data ;-/
[05:03:38] <Cork> eshlox: not really
[05:03:59] <Cork> you need to construct your code so you can call a function with the result
[05:04:15] <Cork> the callback system for ajax can help
[05:04:54] <Cork> eshlox: check_image_url(url).done(function(data) { set_new_value(data.data.url); })
[05:05:42] <Cork> if you don't want to expose fail from the ajax call
[05:05:58] <Cork> you can wrap it all up in your own callback system
[05:06:01] <Cork> ?.callback
[05:06:04] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".callback" in jQuery Docs.
[05:06:07] <Cork> ?.Callbacks
[05:06:09] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".Callbacks" in jQuery Docs.
[05:06:41] <Cork> bot-t: you're high or something?
[05:06:42] <bot-t> Cork, Concentrate and ask again.
[05:06:49] <Cork> eshlox: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[05:06:53] <Cork> ah...
[05:06:54] <eshlox> ;-D
[05:06:59] <Cork> ?jquery.callbacks
[05:07:00] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery.Callbacks() - A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[05:07:03] * Cork nods
[05:07:31] <eshlox> ok, thanks
[05:07:50] <Cork> eshlox: but anyway you can't use return for the response
[05:08:10] <Cork> eshlox: for that to be possible you would have to frees the page until the response comes back from the server
[05:09:04] <seutje> heh, did he expect me to add the assets? o.O
[05:09:07] <Cork> there is an old deprecated state for ajax call that does that, but it's just legacy supported and not developed so its strongly recommended ageist using it
[05:09:55] <Cork> hmm ios safari is... weird
[05:10:07] <Cork> it handles position: fixed just fine
[05:10:16] <Cork> until you use the on screen keyboard
[05:10:22] <Cork> then it goes nuts O_o'
[05:11:58] <seutje> or untill u don't wrap it in whatever they expect u to wrap it in
[05:12:15] <Cork> heh
[05:12:16] <Cork> ya
[05:12:39] <Cork> and i'm just doing the easy versions right now
[05:13:02] <Cork> i know i'm going to cry blood when i get to android 2.2 and ios 4
[05:14:21] <seutje> wait until u get ppl bitching about blurry images on retina and you have no assets for it
[05:14:38] <Cork> they won't
[05:14:49] <Cork> unless they run with a really old version of ios
[05:14:56] <mikunos1> any idea?
[05:14:57] <Cork> ios 5.1+ gets svg images
[05:15:07] <mikunos1> this is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/1/
[05:15:27] <seutje> if only SVG was usable for more than 1% of the assets I deal with :P
[05:15:53] <mikunos1> any help?
[05:16:10] <Cork> seutje: as long as its generated the correct way svg can represent almost any image (except photos)
[05:16:25] <geiregjo> seutje you dutch?
[05:16:27] <seutje> photos being like 99% of the assets I deal with
[05:16:32] <Cork> lol
[05:16:33] <Cork> ok
[05:16:42] <Cork> its like 0.1% of mine :)
[05:16:42] <seutje> geiregjo: nationality or language-wise?
[05:17:02] <geiregjo> both?
[05:17:04] <seutje> I always get PSDs
[05:17:10] <Cork> mikaelb: you need to ask your question too
[05:17:13] <seutje> so it's a losing battle right off the bat
[05:17:54] <mikunos1> is there a way to click in a TR of a Table and tick the corresponding checkbox? I have written here my code http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/1/
[05:17:56] <Cork> seutje: ya, used to be that for me too, but we got to know it was created originally in illustrator so.. :)
[05:18:03] <seutje> lol
[05:18:17] <Cork> so it was quite an easy task to ask for the esp file
[05:18:38] <Cork> and then converting that to svg wasn't too hard
[05:18:57] <Cork> *eps
[05:19:07] <Cork> man i always switch the last two characters >_<
[05:20:40] <mikunos1> any idea?
[05:20:55] <geiregjo> seutje: Belgian or Dutch?
[05:21:28] <r3v3rb> so var alt = $(li a).get(currentIndex) is giving me the dom element I want but now I cannot use alt.Title for example as alt is not an object? any ideas
[05:21:50] <seutje> mikunos1: http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/2/
[05:22:10] <seutje> heh, did fiddle just die on me whilst saving?
[05:22:11] <mikunos1> thanks
[05:22:46] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/3/
[05:22:50] <seutje> ah, there we go
[05:23:04] <Cork> mikunos1: that should make it work even better
[05:23:47] <seutje> Cork: I just end up forcing initial-size to 0.5 for retina shizzle
[05:24:20] <seutje> but it triggers what the marketing guys affectionately call "the iPad version" and then they bitch about that
[05:24:23] <Cork> seutje: heh, that sucks
[05:24:40] <Cork> lol
[05:25:04] <Cork> i bet that if you give them a highres version of the image
[05:25:24] <Cork> they're going to bitch about bandwidth usage
[05:25:35] <seutje> then I always play dumb and go all "iPad version? is that different from our dev version? does it resemble the acceptance version? ...?"
[05:27:38] <r3v3rb> .eq is what I wanted :D
[05:28:12] <Trisox> hey Cork
[05:28:18] <Cork> o/
[05:28:22] <benj3> is it possible to add "+= '+ variable +'" in scrollTo?
[05:28:52] <Cork> benj3: as long as the resulting string is what scrollTo expects
[05:29:10] <benj3> aka i have http://pastebin.com/yAvR9n3C this im trying to make scrollTo scroll the +bodyheight each keyup function
[05:29:13] <Cork> benj3: but variable will be a snapshot in time from when you generated the string
[05:29:50] <Cork> benj3: bodyfin will be a static value
[05:29:50] <benj3> I can get the variable working alone
[05:30:15] <Cork> when you generate that value what height there is is the only thing that will be used
[05:30:20] <benj3> bodyfin will be the value of the height of the document?
[05:30:49] <Cork> bodyfin will be a string of '+=' and the value of bodyheight at that time
[05:31:13] <benj3> the only problem is, += isnt working
[05:31:23] <benj3> it works when i remove +=
[05:31:26] <Cork> that was the question before :)
[05:31:29] <benj3> and just use bodyfin
[05:31:35] <Cork> not sure if scrollTo accepts that
[05:31:53] <Trisox> beh stupid stuff
[05:32:07] <benj3> tis a pain :(
[05:32:44] <Trisox> no not that i was talking about the little ipad html thingy i was building
[05:32:51] <benj3> it works fine the first keyup function but then its already at the correct point but i want it to add that value to scrollTo every keyup function :)
[05:33:00] <benj3> ah ok Trisox :D
[05:33:03] <Cork> benj3: $(...).scrollTo( {top:'-=100px', left:'+=100'}, 800 );
[05:33:33] <benj3> yep that works, but i need to replace the 100px bit with the variable bodyfin
[05:33:40] <Trisox> Cork:  how did you do content blocks with horizontal and vertical views?
[05:33:58] <Cork> benj3: so '+=' + variable + 'px'
[05:34:10] <Trisox> indeed +'px'
[05:34:17] <Cork> Trisox: not sure what you mean
[05:34:33] <Trisox> well i'm prototyping something
[05:34:33] <Trisox> http://vospascal.nl/ipadui/
[05:34:43] <Trisox> it got 3 slides
[05:35:04] <Cork> ok and?
[05:35:13] <Trisox> on landscape its fine on portraid it scaled down
[05:35:47] * Cork still waits for the question
[05:36:36] <benj3> woo
[05:36:40] <benj3> thanks Cork :)
[05:36:47] <Cork> :)
[05:36:52] <benj3> <3
[05:38:24] <mikunos1> hi again may I to use: $('.datatable tbody').click(function(event) { } ?
[05:38:43] <Cork> mikunos1: check the link i gave you
[05:38:44] <mikunos1> in order to select a click event only for the tr within the tbody
[05:38:46] <mikunos1> section
[05:38:55] <Cork> that should reduce all the tracing problems you have
[05:39:23] <Cork> mikunos1: but yes, .datatable tbody should work fine
[05:39:57] <mikunos1> Cork I am using your code but when I click on the first checkbox in the head of the column
[05:39:59] <Cork> mikunos1: the link i gave you uses delegation to make it easier to make the relation to the correct row
[05:40:51] <Cork> on('click', 'tr', function() {}) !== click(function() {})
[05:41:31] <mikunos1> http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/3/ if you click on the Creation Date header title the first checkbox must not to be checked
[05:41:48] <eshlox> someone tried to load images from facebook graph? https://graph.facebook.com/shaverm/picture?type=large this redirect to another location and im thinking if juery can help becouse browser doesn't refresh this ;-s
[05:42:15] <Cork> mikunos1: so http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/5/
[05:42:40] <Trisox> Cork: any idea's?
[05:42:52] <Cork> Trisox: * Cork still waits for the question <--
[05:43:15] <Trisox> well how did you handle portrait landscape mode stuff
[05:43:16] <Cork> Trisox: what is it you're trying to fix/handle
[05:43:27] <Trisox> http://vospascal.nl/ipadui/ like this
[05:43:29] <Trisox> the blocks
[05:43:34] <Cork> Trisox: depends on what you want to do
[05:43:44] <mikunos1> TypeError: $(".datatable tbody").on is not a function
[05:43:56] <Trisox> make them fit on both orientations
[05:44:00] <Cork> mikunos1: what version of jquery are you using?
[05:44:06] <mikunos1> let me see it
[05:44:32] <Cork> Trisox: trigger on resize on the window and reorganize the positions of the elements
[05:44:40] <mikunos1> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.6.2
[05:45:14] <Trisox> hmm didnt know resize was calle
[05:45:15] <Trisox> d
[05:45:21] <Cork> mikunos1: http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/6/
[05:46:02] <Cork> Trisox: it has to else js can't know the viewport changed size
[05:46:29] <Trisox> well  window.addEventListener("orientationchange", function() {});
[05:47:14] <mikunos1> it doesn't work Cork
[05:47:17] <mikunos1> :(
[05:47:22] <Cork> mikaelb: that page works
[05:47:26] <Cork> and it uses 1.6.4
[05:47:34] <mikunos1> let me see again
[05:47:37] <Cork> *mikunos1:
[05:47:59] <Cork> Trisox: hmm do you know what browsers support that one?
[05:48:11] <Trisox> no do you
[05:48:42] <mikunos1> It doesn't work because the rows are created from a jquery request
[05:48:54] <mikunos1> and them are not present at the start
[05:49:10] <Cork> Trisox: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/resize_mobile.html
[05:49:39] <Cork> mikunos1: delegate should fix that
[05:49:50] <Cork> mikunos1: unless you create the entire table
[05:50:01] <Cork> (or don't create the tbody element)
[05:50:06] <Trisox> Cork: so pretty nice then
[05:50:20] <mikunos1> I have copied it into my code but nothing
[05:50:21] <swe_ET> ,on should work
[05:50:22] <Cork> mikunos1: http://jsfiddle.net/X8rgj/7/
[05:50:26] <Cork> what about that one?
[05:51:04] <mikunos1> This Works!
[05:51:05] <mikunos1> thanks
[05:51:18] <Cork> :)
[05:51:37] <Cork> mikunos1: the specifics are important to be able to help ;)
[05:52:06] <Cork> swe_ET: no on was introduced in 1.7
[05:52:11] <mikunos1> right
[05:52:35] <Cork> doesn't really matter though
[05:52:53] <Cork> delegate does the same thing with a bit of a different syntax
[06:00:56] <lobbin> I have a controlgroup of checkboxes contained in a list item, how can I make the checkboxes to fill the entire list item?
[06:05:00] <Cork> width: 100%; ?
[06:08:06] <lobbin> 100% on what? The label? the fieldset already is 100%
[06:08:29] <Cork> the label
[06:08:46] <Cork> depending on how you position the input field it might need to be fiddled with a bit
[06:11:09] <ZadYree> Hello here, I'm having an issue using a jQuery: The callback seems not to be shown. Here are the HTML & JS snippets: http://pastebin.com/4QxVXjwQ
[06:11:42] <sacho> can you put that up on jsfiddle
[06:11:54] <ZadYree> k
[06:12:33] <Cork> ZadYree: $('#login img.auth-loader') won't work
[06:12:45] <Cork> ZadYree: its $('#login + img.auth-loader')
[06:13:02] <ZadYree> ah, lemme try, while jsfiddling ^^
[06:13:22] <Cork> wait a min no
[06:13:31] <Cork> your adding it after submit
[06:13:38] <Cork> not after #login
[06:13:48] <ZadYree> yup
[06:13:57] <Cork> ah
[06:14:02] <Cork> ok then scratch that :)
[06:14:07] <ZadYree> ok :P
[06:16:10] <ZadYree> http://jsfiddle.net/sfXFM/
[06:17:03] <Cork> ZadYree: don't forget the dropdowns on the left
[06:17:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/sfXFM/2/
[06:17:50] <ZadYree> ok
[06:17:59] <sacho> So which part doesn't work?
[06:19:05] <Cork> ZadYree: ?
[06:19:14] <sarah1_> can someone please help me I am a n00b.. just want to change the background color of a page before loaded to pink and then change the body font from times to arial and can't figure it out.
[06:19:38] <ZadYree> well, the post query is well sent, but the server answer is not shown
[06:19:46] <ZadYree> it's in HTML
[06:20:04] <seutje> POST http://fiddle.jshell.net/sfXFM/2/show/auth/connect 404 (NOT FOUND)
[06:20:12] <seutje> that's prolly why the result isn't shown
[06:20:40] <ZadYree> the server is local, it's not in production mode yet
[06:21:35] <Cork> seutje: http://fiddle.jshell.net/sfXFM/2/show/
[06:22:49] <sacho> ZadYree, the callback itself works fine, so perhaps it's related to something else.
[06:22:56] <ZadYree> hum ok
[06:23:15] <sacho> you can test it by just assigning the callback a name and calling it directly with some random data.
[06:23:36] <ZadYree> ah yeah, thanks
[06:23:47] <ZadYree> I'll be back if I can't figure it out :P
[06:25:49] <burg> with jqueryui tabs, how can i select a tab and load in the panel something different than the tab points to ? programatically not on click

[06:27:30] <lazyfingers> hello. is anyone using mobile version of datepicker and had a problem when clicking on a day (grayed days) which is outside of currently selected month? for me, month doesn't switch and cells with current month days become empty. thanks in advance.
[06:28:47] <lobbin> Are there any good companies that work with jquery mobile design? For hire that is
[06:31:48] <mar_> new to js and jquery... i have a table with data and each row has a cell with a delete button, which is meant to delete the entire row... is there a straightforward way to accomplish this? (e.g. somehow determine which occurrence of the button has been clicked and delete the n-th row of the table accordingly)
[06:34:08] <lazyfingers> mar_: try this. $('.delete-button').click(function() { this.parent().remove(); });
[06:34:23] <Angel> hi
[06:34:36] <Angel> I need some basic jQuery help and I was wondering if anybody here could help
[06:35:26] <sacho> maybe
[06:35:31] <Angel> okay
[06:35:35] <Angel> It's quite basic
[06:35:47] <Angel> What I need is to change the body class using jQuery
[06:35:56] <Angel> I found a script but it does not work
[06:36:03] <lazyfingers> mar_: assuming parent is the container, with rows it would be one more level up, but you should get the idea
[06:36:24] <mar_> yes this sounds like something that would just work
[06:36:29] <mar_> trying it out as we speak
[06:37:45] <mar_> oh, right... this is where it gets a little bit complicated
[06:38:04] <mar_> because clicking the delete button brings up a modal window in which i have to confirm my choice
[06:38:13] <mar_> one second
[06:38:40] <lazyfingers> mar_ then, $('.delete-button').click(function() { if (confirm('Rly?')) { this.parent().parent().remove(); } });
[06:39:34] <lazyfingers> ah, modal. well. just add an attribute to each row, id for example and then just address it directly
[06:39:50] <mar_> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[06:39:52] <mar_> aye
[06:40:12] <mar_> i was thinking i'll have to resort to some sort of parameter passing

[06:40:43] <mar_> thank you for your effort

[06:40:52] <cyd> i have a problem with fancyBox 2

[06:41:22] <cyd> and i think it's a noob fault. but anyway here we go:

[06:43:08] <cyd> but if put a link on the main page the fancyBox works...
[06:44:14] <cyd> here is my testsite: http://www.morep.somee.com

[06:48:07] <hyper_ch> seutje: what do you mean?
[06:49:07] <hyper_ch> seutje: when I run the code on a html site, the cookie gets set properly... however the row color toggle isn't working
[06:55:33] <seutje> hyper_ch: class toggles fine once I add jquery cookie plugin

[06:57:53] <seutje> hyper_ch: I see the class being added though
[06:58:06] <seutje> should prolly add a rule to ur css for it

[07:28:21] <systemfault> I'm working on a shit website at the moment.. it has <style> tags in the body and it works just fine on all browsers
[07:29:04] <halcyon1234> systemfault: Check out the jsbin. Page 2 has a style tag in the body, trying to override the style of the colored block. It doesn't work if you go Page 1 to Page 2. If you Page 2 directly, it works.
[07:29:44] <halcyon1234> I'm assuming I'm doing something stupid wrong, and jquery mobile ajax page transition engine doesn't like it.
[07:30:28] <koopajah> reloadz > yse the answer provided in the question, no ?
[07:33:29] <reloadz> koopajah: i use the script that i was given in StackOverflow - so far so good
[07:34:26] <reloadz> + you answer was correct - it gave me more accurat "querstion" to google
[07:35:00] <koopajah> reloadz > yeah I could have just given the answer but you wouldn't have understood what was really happening with your bug ^^
[07:41:35] <Doxin> what would lead $('#playlist_item_'+playlist_current).addClass("active") to not adding the class to the right element?
[07:49:22] <MalMen> http://jsbin.com/epimel/6/
[07:49:32] <MalMen> why post is not sending any data ?
[07:50:03] <NoiseEee> Doxin: playlist_current not being what you expect it to be, multiple IDs....
[07:50:21] <vinici> MalMen $("lembra-me").val(), $("msgid").val()
[07:50:27] <vinici> what the hell is that?
[07:50:36] <vinici> give it, a . (dot) if it is a class
[07:50:39] <MalMen> is the data i want to send in the post
[07:50:42] <vinici> or a # is it is a id
[07:50:54] <MalMen> ahmmm
[07:50:57] <MalMen> good point
[07:51:00] <vinici> $("lembra-me") dont return anything hehe
[07:51:08] <vinici> it is the field id?
[07:51:09] <MalMen> yes.. i mss the #
[07:51:14] <vinici> ok :)
[07:51:18] <Doxin> NoiseEee: I'm logging playlist_current, ids are unique.
[07:51:31] <MalMen> thank you vinici... damn me xD
[07:51:38] <vinici> de nada cara :)
[07:51:59] <NoiseEee> Doxin: well fire up your debugger.  what do you mean by 'not adding class to the right element'?  is it adding the class to an element you don't expect? or ?
[07:52:25] <Doxin> NoiseEee: it's not adding it anywhere as far as I see.
[07:53:25] <NoiseEee> Doxin: well fire up your debugger / put in a breakpoint that really tells you what $('#playlist_item_'+playlist_current) is at the time
[07:53:48] <Doxin> NoiseEee: I have, it's #playlist_item_0
[07:54:10] <Doxin> NoiseEee: I'm wondering, if I add something to the dom, does it have some sort of delay before I can modify it?
[07:54:11] <NoiseEee> and in your console, what does $('#playlist_item_0') return
[07:54:21] <NoiseEee> Doxin: no, it just has to be there
[07:54:53] <benj3> Does any one know if its possible to change the scrollTo position if someone resizes the page?
[07:55:03] <Doxin> NoiseEee: well, I don't see why it's not working then.
[07:55:18] <NoiseEee> how do you know the class isn't there?  in your console, what does $('#playlist_item_0') return
[07:55:26] <Doxin> OH
[07:55:39] <Doxin> NoiseEee: id="#playlist_item_0" isn't gonna help
[08:12:53] <bleen> how do I select all "label" elements that do not contain the letter Q ?
[08:13:18] <bleen> $('label:not(:contains(Q))')  doesnt seem to =be doing it for me
[08:14:03] <koopajah> bleen > where is the Q ? in the name? in the id?
[08:14:12] <NoiseEee> You'd want to quote Q for starters
[08:14:19] <bleen> koopajah: <label>Qwerty</label>
[08:15:03] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/6PPeF/ @ bleen
[08:16:02] <bleen> indeed â€¦ it was my missing quotes
[08:16:03] <bleen> thans

[08:16:54] <Croves> Hello guys. I have a form where you can dynamically add input text for insert a date (DD/MM/YYYY). So, I'm using the maskedinput jquery plugin, but the mask don't apply in the fields created dinamically
[08:19:04] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone any google maps gurus around?
[08:19:17] <jarr0dsz> after some suggestions i have still not be able to fix a issue with maps geo location and calculation directions
[08:19:51] <jarr0dsz> darroNZ: still around ;p
[08:19:55] <docmur> What is the correct way to do a compound add, I have a number in input x and I want to compound add it to totalCost, I tried totalCost+=x.val() but it will just append it such as 202020 not 60
[08:20:09] <jarr0dsz> i have looked into your example and reply on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13512365/google-maps-calculate-directions-after-user-gives-his-current-location but i cannot find much info since in using jquery google maps *mobile*
[08:20:49] <Croves> docmur, I guess you'll need to use parseInt or parseFloat to do a sum

[08:43:41] <itatitat> guys, I'm adding an element in my dom each time I make click in a button, and later, making click in another button I remove() the element again. The problem is that if I repeat the experiment, trying to add it again, I have duplicates elements, is not working the remove?, I tested the selector and It's fine. I see window object printed in the screen
[08:44:25] <itatitat> what's going on?
[08:44:48] <alcuadrado> docmur,
[08:44:54] <alcuadrado> maybe trying smth like this: Array(100).join("*")
[08:46:16] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ itatitat
[08:46:17] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:46:50] <SmallCode> Whats up guys
[08:49:09] <Foxhoundz> Hello
[08:49:25] <Foxhoundz> WHy jsFiddle
[08:55:33] <SmallCode> Why isn't .each looping over all the elements, it only loops over one
[08:57:20] <matteu> SmallCode:  Do you have some example code? http://jsfiddle.net
[08:57:37] <SmallCode> matteu, it was because I didn't include div#random_div
[08:57:42] <SmallCode> I just did #random_div
[08:58:00] <SmallCode> which is kind of stupid but then again, maybe it doesn't know which one you want to loopover
[08:58:07] <SmallCode> thats kind of dumb that i had to include div to make it work
[08:58:26] <matteu> SmallCode: Are you giving other elements a 'random_div' id?
[08:58:32] <Nitrodist> how do I write a selector that selects an li element that has a child anchor that has a href of 'xxx'?
[08:58:34] <SmallCode> No only div
[08:59:04] <SmallCode> $('li').child
[09:00:10] <SmallCode> nitrodist
[09:00:12] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: undefined
[09:00:19] <SmallCode> Nitro what is the child element called
[09:00:22] <SmallCode> is it specific?>
[09:00:34] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: it has specific href
[09:00:43] <SmallCode> What type of element is it
[09:00:49] <matteu> Nitrodist:  $('li').find( 'a[href="myhref"]').parent('li')
[09:00:49] <SmallCode> Or do we not always know that?
[09:00:50] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: anchor
[09:00:59] <itatitat> My problem with duplicates is this, remove() looks that is not removing, I see object windows in the screen:
[09:00:59] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/6FHJU/
[09:01:19] <SmallCode> Okay
[09:01:23] <SmallCode> Matteu code works then I think
[09:01:29] <SmallCode> Althought, I dont know why he did .parent();
[09:01:54] <matteu> SmallCode:, Nitrodist: Nitrodist asked to select the li element that had a child with a specific href
[09:02:03] <SmallCode> Yeah
[09:02:11] <SmallCode> But then you got the parent li
[09:02:28] <SmallCode> Oh
[09:02:30] <matteu> SmallCode:  That selects the li elements that have children that match the criteria
[09:02:32] <SmallCode> I get it now
[09:02:50] <SmallCode> Because then the (this) would be for the href one
[09:02:53] <SmallCode> he wants to manipulate the li
[09:03:34] <SmallCode> And .parent finds the closest then matteu?
[09:04:26] <matteu> SmallCode:  .parent onl travels one level
[09:04:53] <SmallCode> Oh
[09:05:07] <matteu> SmallCode:, Nitrodist:  so my code might have to be altered to use 'parents' and more refined selectors if the anchor tag is deeper within the li element sought
[09:05:10] <SmallCode> So what if you wanted to go up as far as you could to find an id of  'somewhere'
[09:05:16] <itatitat> I have this problem with object window, I dont know why I have this kind of objects when I try to remove a simple element from the DOM: http://jsfiddle.net/6FHJU/
[09:05:20] <SmallCode> Okay parents
[09:05:36] <SmallCode> Matteu I might have a question for you in a sec
[09:06:07] <Nitrodist> matteu: thanks for the tip -- didn't realize I could use scoping!
[09:06:21] <Nitrodist> matteu: now, the href selector doesn't work for some reason, any idea? http://i.imgur.com/hwHtK.png <-
[09:06:32] <SmallCode> var divTop = $('div#random_div');
[09:06:42] <SmallCode> Say I have 20 divs on a page Matteu
[09:06:51] <SmallCode> Would I want to use .each and then add them to an array
[09:07:05] <matteu> SmallCode:  What are you trying to do?
[09:07:19] <SmallCode> When you slide past a div, for now I just want it to alert
[09:07:34] <SmallCode> But it has to be specific
[09:07:41] <matteu> Nitrodist: if you could provide me with a fiddle, that would be helpful
[09:07:43] <SmallCode> B/c I need to be able to get the $(this)
[09:07:57] <Nitrodist> matteu: k
[09:08:27] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/6FHJU/
[09:08:28] <SmallCode> Nitrodist
[09:08:37] <SmallCode> It contains 6358
[09:08:43] <SmallCode> Thats why its pulling up
[09:08:48] <SmallCode> Is that what you want?
[09:08:58] <matteu> SmallCode:  I'm still don't understand what you're doing.  If by 'slide' you mean mouseover or mousein, than the appropriate jQuery events can be used which automatically give you context on the variable `this`
[09:09:14] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: it doesn't return any of them -- they all have 6358 in the href
[09:09:15] <SmallCode> Matteu, I have a list of divison vertically down the page
[09:09:20] <SmallCode> after you scroll to the top of the page
[09:09:31] <SmallCode> and you scroll past the first div, it should fire a alert
[09:09:35] <SmallCode> then onto the next and do the same
[09:09:53] <matteu> SmallCode:  fiddle?
[09:12:50] <sunbeam> say i have a ul li a structure (with depth: 1 sub navigation inside the top level li)
[09:13:02] <SmallCode> Matteu
[09:13:03] <SmallCode> http://jsfiddle.net/6cfwr/
[09:13:08] <sunbeam> and certain ul > li  has a class .opened
[09:13:11] <Nitrodist> matteu: http://jsfiddle.net/pMH5B/
[09:13:13] <SmallCode> I was adding a little mroe code to show you waht i wanted
[09:13:25] <SmallCode> Matteu
[09:13:28] <sunbeam> when an icon outside this is clicked, I want to go to the next ul > li and give it the class .opened
[09:13:28] <SmallCode> Take a look at my code
[09:13:32] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[09:13:32] <SmallCode> ill look at nitros
[09:13:40] <_bruno> Hello, have any way to better this code? http://jsfiddle.net/9wJ8n/1/
[09:13:40] <SmallCode> @Sunbeam, one moment
[09:14:17] <SmallCode> Nitrodist
[09:14:24] <SmallCode> Im looking at it right now
[09:14:30] <SmallCode> So basically anylink that has /6358/
[09:14:31] <Nitrodist> ..great... ;)
[09:14:34] <SmallCode> you want to be colored green?
[09:14:40] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: that's the idea
[09:14:45] <SmallCode> Ok one moment
[09:17:18] <SmallCode> Nitro
[09:17:23] <SmallCode> They all have 6358 in them lol
[09:17:30] <SmallCode> So that piece of code is working as intended
[09:17:33] <SmallCode> just use *=
[09:18:00] <SmallCode> NitroDist
[09:18:01] <SmallCode> http://jsfiddle.net/pMH5B/6/
[09:18:06] <SmallCode> NitroDist, I changed the colors beware
[09:18:14] <SmallCode> beaware*
[09:18:26] <matteu> SmallCode:  You don't have to build an array.  I would try changing your check to something resembling: if( divTop.offset()['top'] < $(document).scrollTop()) { ... }
[09:18:53] <Nitrodist> nice thanks SmallCode
[09:18:59] <SmallCode> Np Nitro
[09:18:59] <Nitrodist> SmallCode: I thought ~= was regex?
[09:19:01] <matteu> SmallCode:  Also set variables for the program to check if it's entered a div so that the browser doesn't try to open more than one alert
[09:19:14] <SmallCode> @Nitrodist http://stackoverflow.com/questions/303956/jquery-select-a-which-href-contains-some-string
[09:19:23] <matteu> SmallCode:  < is better than == in this case because it allows for some room for the code to fire the event
[09:19:32] <SmallCode> Matteu, hold on
[09:19:42] <SmallCode> Okay so what are we gonna do with that divTop offset
[09:19:48] <Nitrodist> could have sworn ~= was regex, thanks SmallCode
[09:19:55] <SmallCode> Np
[09:20:35] <SmallCode> Okay so ScrollTop basically is going to check to see if they are at the top of the div
[09:20:44] <sunbeam> say i have a ul li a structure (with depth: 1 sub navigation inside the top level li)
[09:20:47] <sunbeam> and certain ul > li  has a class .opened
[09:20:49] <sunbeam> when an icon outside this is clicked, I want to go to the next ul > li and give it the class .opened
[09:20:53] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[09:21:08] <SmallCode> sunbream, jsfiddle
[09:22:59] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: when an icon is clicked, grab the element with the current class .opened.  note the next li.  remove class from current element, add class to next .li
[09:23:13] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: all of that can almost be literally translated to jquery methods.  good luck.
[09:24:06] <SmallCode> Matteu im so used to using array, I am C++ programmer
[09:24:16] <SmallCode> Used to having to do everything the hardway
[09:24:16] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: thanks!
[09:24:20] <SmallCode> not use to function calls lol
[09:24:27] <SmallCode> for all the functionality of my webapp
[09:24:41] <SmallCode> Or maybe I meant to say
[09:24:45] <SmallCode> Im used to doing all the thinking
[09:24:50] <matteu> SmallCode:  the .each method should make the distinction between using a jQuery object drawn from using a selector and an array trivial
[09:24:51] <SmallCode> and not relaying on jQuery haha
[09:25:09] <SmallCode> Well im using .each
[09:25:12] <SmallCode> to add it to an array
[09:25:21] <SmallCode> Ahh you know what matteu
[09:25:28] <SmallCode> That is better to use that in the document.scroll function
[09:25:32] <SmallCode> I was going to use a for statement
[09:25:32] <xboi209> hey i have a javascript question not related to jquery but I've been stuck on this for a while now
[09:25:39] <SmallCode> xboi209, go ahead
[09:25:49] <xboi209> how would i go around incrementing a variable in document.write with text around it
[09:26:04] <SmallCode> What do you mean xboi
[09:26:04] <matteu> xboi209: use parseInt()
[09:26:15] <SmallCode> There ya go, see I would of had you doing var++
[09:26:16] <SmallCode> lol
[09:26:18] <xboi209> let's say my variable a = 1
[09:26:29] <xboi209> wait
[09:26:31] <SmallCode> You want to increase it by one?
[09:26:41] <SmallCode> a++;
[09:26:49] <matteu> xboi209: jQuery's .html can get you the number string. Javascript's parseInt() will turn it into a number, and then you can use jQuery's .html method to put it back
[09:27:05] <SmallCode> Hold on matteu, I dont think thats what hes asking
[09:27:19] <xboi209> SmallCode, I can't simply do a++
[09:27:22] <xboi209> look up at my example
[09:27:25] <SmallCode> Oh
[09:27:28] <SmallCode> Okay
[09:27:29] <SmallCode> Then yes
[09:27:32] <SmallCode> Matteu is right
[09:27:36] <SmallCode> You would have to paresein
[09:27:40] <SmallCode> parseint
[09:27:45] <SmallCode> assign it to a variable
[09:27:55] <SmallCode> increment it, then add it back in via .html
[09:28:11] <SmallCode> Which is everything matteu said.
[09:28:53] <sunbeam> hmm just wondering, isn't there any firebug a like way to point elements in chrome?
[09:28:58] <xboi209> ugh
[09:29:09] <xboi209> wait....
[09:29:10] <sunbeam> with the mouse cursor
[09:29:20] <xboi209> i don't think matteu answered the question
[09:29:31] <xboi209> correctly
[09:29:32] <xboi209> *
[09:30:12] <sunbeam> nevermind
[09:30:19] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: still here? got one more question
[09:32:00] <matteu> xboi209:  Can you create a fiddle to help us along?  http://jsfiddle.net
[09:32:20] <xboi209> nvm just forget about it
[09:32:33] <SmallCode> Matteu, so now how would I check to see if  $(this) has been scrolled past
[09:32:53] <SmallCode> http://jsfiddle.net/3TX5R/
[09:32:56] <SmallCode> Im trying something liek this
[09:33:00] <matteu> SmallCode:  When the scroll event fires for a specific div, you could store state in global variables
[09:33:23] <SmallCode> Well look at how I did that, could something like that work
[09:34:12] <matteu> SmallCode:  .each requires you to pass implied parameters to acccess the current element and index
[09:34:49] <matteu> SmallCode MyCollection.each( i, elem) { /* ith element referenced by elem */ }
[09:34:51] <SmallCode> I thought each lets you iterate through
[09:35:00] <gear4> is there a way for me to get the width of an HTML table ?
[09:35:02] <SmallCode> The elements
[09:35:19] <SmallCode> Gear4 you could use the attribute
[09:35:24] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/width/ @ gear4
[09:35:37] <SmallCode> Yeah
[09:35:39] <SmallCode> Use .width
[09:35:39] <gear4> dynamic width too ?
[09:35:49] <SmallCode> .outterwidth
[09:35:52] <SmallCode> I think is a function
[09:36:03] <gear4> ohkie
[09:36:04] <gear4> I try
[09:36:19] <SmallCode> Matteu, I thought .each lets you iterate over a group of elements
[09:36:51] <matteu> SmallCode: It does
[09:37:31] <matteu> SmallCode:  like a foreach it lets you access elements iteratively, and like a for loop it lets you track an index
[09:37:42] <SmallCode> Oh
[09:37:43] <SmallCode> Okay
[09:37:48] <SmallCode> Is the index a static variable?
[09:37:48] <matteu> SmallCode:  To do that, you use impled parameters as demonstrated
[09:38:09] <matteu> SmallCode:  Although, it might be (elem, i), I don't remember the order off the top of my head
[09:38:24] <SmallCode> $('li').each(function(index)
[09:38:31] <SmallCode> So everytime .each fires off
[09:38:38] <SmallCode> index increases by one
[09:38:43] <SmallCode> and I can check it via
[09:38:49] <SmallCode> if(index==25)
[09:38:50] <SmallCode> etc?
[09:39:08] <matteu> SmallCode: Let me write you a fiddle
[09:39:16] <SmallCode> Eh you dont have to
[09:39:24] <SmallCode> But if you want go ahead
[09:39:28] <t432> This is re jQuery autocomplete widget. The server is passing map object which jQuery interepts as a "key/value" pair but in the log both label and value hold the value object from map, I don't see the key
[09:39:38] <SmallCode> t432, what?
[09:41:23] <SmallCode> t432, its passing a map object?
[09:41:25] <SmallCode> json?
[09:42:10] <SmallCode> t432, Oh I see, I never used that before hmm
[09:42:53] <t432> JQuery autocomplete gets data from the server. Server returns an object of key/Val. When log the retrieved data I don't see the "key",
[09:43:13] <swe_ET> I have a strÃ¤nge issue http://jsfiddle.net/micaelbolognini/568RQ/10/ My obj looks somethng like this.. as you can see I invoke the plugin on two selets.. when  clicking the delete on first -> one the  event firest twice  and removes second-> one other
[09:43:32] <t432> Yes its json
[09:43:55] <SmallCode> t432, one sec
[09:44:00] <SmallCode> Swe_ET
[09:44:14] <SmallCode> What is it doing wrong?
[09:44:46] <swe_ET> as it does produce two uls.. each li has one  deletebutton...
[09:45:00] <t432> It's missing the key value
[09:45:12] <swe_ET> when pressning that .. I'm expecting it to fire once
[09:45:29] <SmallCode> swe_ET I dont see a button?
[09:45:43] <matteu> SmallCode: http://jsfiddle.net/3TX5R/
[09:45:50] <swe_ET> fiddle doesnt render
[09:45:57] <NoiseEee> lol
[09:46:04] <SmallCode> Oh
[09:46:58] <SmallCode> matteu, I already have this code lol
[09:47:29] <SmallCode> And it doesn't work :(
[09:47:49] <matteu> SmallCode:  What does 'it doesn't work' mean?
[09:48:07] <SmallCode> Well when it scrolls past the div it doesnt alert
[09:48:41] <matteu> SmallCode: Do you Firebug?
[09:48:49] <SmallCode> Yeah
[09:49:29] <SmallCode> It goes off when I scroll to the top
[09:49:46] <matteu> SmallCode: Refiddle what you have now
[09:50:13] <SmallCode> http://jsfiddle.net/3TX5R/1/
[09:51:09] <matteu> SmallCode:  Take a look at the comparator
[09:51:21] <matteu> SmallCode:  $(this) == $(document).scrollTop()
[09:51:24] <SmallCode> yeah
[09:51:35] <SmallCode> Change now
[09:51:38] <SmallCode> changing now*
[09:52:33] <SmallCode> Yeah its not working lol
[09:53:07] <SmallCode> Let me look up
[09:53:08] <SmallCode> what $(document).scrollTop()
[09:53:10] <SmallCode> even does
[09:53:14] <SmallCode> Im using it incoherently
[09:56:50] <halcyon1234> Just upgraded to FF17, an a jqm form's button suddenly throws "Error: Permission denied to access property 'role'" in jquery 1.8.2. Haven't even started putting together a test case yet. Anyone else encountered this?
[09:58:46] <matteu> SmallCode: http://jsfiddle.net/3TX5R/3/
[10:00:13] <matteu> SmallCode: Here's probably how I would go about this:
[10:00:29] <SmallCode> Interesting matteu
[10:00:46] <matteu> SmallCode:  1) define scroll breakpoints by selecting each div and getting its offset, storing them in an array
[10:00:55] <matteu> SmallCode: its top offset, I mean
[10:01:06] <SmallCode> Well im gonna tell you waht im doing
[10:01:14] <SmallCode> Ever been to gamestop
[10:01:18] <SmallCode> and there is a machine
[10:01:24] <SmallCode> where you can scroll through a list of games
[10:01:34] <SmallCode> as you scroll further away from the other games
[10:01:36] <SmallCode> the other ones fade out
[10:01:40] <SmallCode> and the one ur closest to fades in
[10:01:52] <SmallCode> But right now
[10:02:03] <SmallCode> I just want to see if I can figure out if its on it
[10:02:15] <SmallCode> So yes the whle breakpoints thing will prolly have to work
[10:02:23] <matteu> SmallCode:  What I'm saying is that you need to define those scroll breakpoints instead of checking properties of the divs themselves
[10:02:41] <SmallCode> Yeah it probably will be too much work
[10:02:46] <SmallCode> because ill never know the exact size of the div
[10:02:56] <matteu> SmallCode: Yes you will
[10:03:06] <SmallCode> Right
[10:04:24] <SmallCode> If anything matteu im learning more about jquery
[10:04:38] <sunbeam> how can I best get the parent Ul of the li a thats clicked
[10:04:40] <SmallCode> I know a lot more than I did a week ago
[10:04:49] <sunbeam> .closest doesnt work because there is a sub ul more close
[10:04:54] <SmallCode> Okay sunbeam
[10:05:08] <SmallCode> So you have setup an $('ul').on click?
[10:05:34] <SmallCode> $('ul').on('click', function() { ... });
[10:05:52] <SmallCode> Oh my bad
[10:05:54] <SmallCode> I meant li
[10:06:08] <SmallCode> then just do .parent('ul')
[10:06:22] <sunbeam> ok
[10:06:22] <sunbeam> sec
[10:06:27] <SmallCode> So you click li
[10:06:29] <SmallCode> then you do
[10:06:45] <SmallCode> $(this).parent('li').css('background-color','blue');
[10:06:51] <SmallCode> I mean
[10:06:52] <SmallCode> UL
[10:06:55] <SmallCode> looool i keep messing it up haha
[10:06:57] <sunbeam> doesn't work
[10:07:01] <SmallCode> Okay one second
[10:07:01] <sunbeam> alert(jQuery(this).parent("ul").html());
[10:07:03] <sunbeam> is what i try
[10:07:06] <SmallCode> Ok
[10:07:10] <SmallCode> Jsfiddle it for me
[10:07:13] <SmallCode> Ill get it to work
[10:07:19] <sunbeam> its kinda complicated what i have
[10:07:23] <SmallCode> Its okay
[10:07:24] <sunbeam> with a lot js and html
[10:07:27] <SmallCode> I used to read assembly lol
[10:07:30] <SmallCode> Nothing is complicated
[10:07:31] <sunbeam> ok lol
[10:09:14] <sunbeam> nvm i found it
[10:09:18] <sunbeam> alert(jQuery(this).closest("li.nav-controls").parent("ul").html());
[10:09:23] <sunbeam> this did it for me
[10:09:27] <SmallCode> Okay awesome!
[10:09:30] <sunbeam> thnx

[11:28:30] <FrameFever> from a class
[11:28:57] <Noeble> FrameFever: you cant remove from a class.. but you can remove from an element with a class using css properties
[11:29:33] <Noeble> $(".class").css("width", "");
[11:30:58] <FrameFever> Noeble: nope, doesn't work
[11:31:11] <Noeble> show me your html of the class you want to change
[11:31:18] <FrameFever> I need to remove it from the class, otherwise it will not take effect

[11:32:02] <FrameFever> creating testcase is to complicated
[11:32:35] <FrameFever> it means in fact, I have to remove the class
[11:32:42] <FrameFever> otherwise it will not work
[11:33:01] <Noeble> $('p').removeClass('myClass yourClass') <-- will remove the class from your selected element

[11:46:03] <NoiseEee> sweet thomas_r
[11:51:25] <ermajn> NoiseEee, use css? It's like you are telling me, don't use jquerymobile, use javascript
[11:52:22] <NoiseEee> ermajn: nowhere did you mention your problem is with jquerymobile
[11:52:53] <ermajn> is this jquerymobile feature: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a3/#docs/toolbars/../../docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[11:52:56] <ermajn> fixed bars?
[11:53:13] <ermajn> well, when I add jquerymoble feature option: data-position="fixed"
[11:53:27] <ermajn> header is really fixed... and that's great
[11:53:50] <ermajn> but, width is wider than screen, and right button is out of screen

[12:16:41] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have a variable li    and it has a value. But somewhere further in the code i see: $(li).data().eventsource   -> what is that li doing in $() ???
[12:16:45] <Krambiorix> what does it mean?
[12:17:51] <swe_ET> its the sizzle selector
[12:17:59] <bobsomebody> Krambiorix, its the element it will match, this code you put would work on all LI tags
[12:19:44] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: its turning your li into a jquery object, and therefore makes jquery methods accessible to it
[12:23:09] <systemfault> That would work unless you have a variable called "li"
[12:23:15] <systemfault> *wouldn't
[12:23:24] <systemfault> Ah oops :P Misread
[12:25:33] <Krambiorix> systemfault, the variable is li
[12:25:50] <Krambiorix> ah
[12:25:52] <Krambiorix> ok

[12:34:27] <shoky> ryannielson: you're including things that depend on jquery, before jquery

[12:36:15] <TechCel> I'm trying to keep my table to be the "last top 20". I remove the $table.find('tr:last-child') after which I do $trheader.after('new row'). This is not keeping my table at 20 elements, and it grows and grows. Why is this so?
[12:38:42] <amirite> so i was using iframe title from a child window to share client-side data with the parent window
[12:38:55] <shoky> ryannielson: derp
[12:39:02] <amirite> and then to my dismay i discover that both same origin and same port or required to be successful
[12:39:19] <amirite> same host is okay, but port on different servers
[12:39:23] <amirite> what are my workaround options
[12:39:25] <NoiseEee> amirite: oh well
[12:40:06] <TechCel> any ideas?
[12:40:32] <shoky> ?demo @ TechCel
[12:40:32] <bot-t> TechCel, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:52:50] <TechCel> i have a fiddle but can't seem to repro, this only difference being a server is sending data which is being received thru ajax. must be it's coming in on a different thread, so i'm the victim of thread sync issues. Does that make sense?
[12:53:01] <TechCel> is that even plausible in a browser? I assume jquery queues can fix this
[12:55:14] <futurecat> hey there
[12:55:49] <futurecat> May I request some help on cross-domain GET requests, CORS, and firebug telling me that my request is a 200 but still displays it in red?
[12:56:25] <enderx86> I want to create an online survey, consisting of 10 questions, each with numerical answers on a 1 to 5 scale. I want people to be able to take the survey a maximum of two times a day, separated by a certain number of hours. The survey will consist of multiple quizzes, and the user can take one, several, or all. I'm curious what the best way to go about this is. I'm doing it in AJAX and Java servlets... and I don't know
[12:56:26] <enderx86> whether all of the HTML should be dynamically generated, whether I should have multiple forms, etc.
[12:58:47] <zsoc> does | have any special meaning in json?
[12:59:31] <versatiletech> zsoc: Is it in quotes?
[13:00:04] <zsoc> {"result":"something|"}
[13:00:10] <versatiletech> nope
[13:00:15] <zsoc> k
[13:00:24] <versatiletech> no special meaning it's just a string character
[13:00:30] <zsoc> i love ambiguous garbage left by other people lol
[13:00:52] <versatiletech> yeah, sometimes programmers will use "|" as a separator
[13:01:34] <zsoc> yeah i see a case of {"result":"something|3"} ... maybe the idea was to use different numbers and convert them to human readable strings after the ajax call... but that doesn't happen anywhere -_-
[13:01:35] <TechCel> put another way, could ajax requests/responses make ui updates 'dirty'?
[13:02:51] <systemfault> TechCel: JS doesn't have the concept of thread
[13:03:03] <enderx86> Okay, to rephrase my question. I have a survey that consists of multiple quizzes, and the user can take one or more. Should I have a separate form for each quiz? I will only have one submit button. How do I go about this?
[13:03:41] <systemfault> TechCel: And ajax itself doesn't have anything to do with the UI... unless you're doing sync requests which will freeze the UI for a moment (You should never do that)
[13:03:47] <versatiletech> enderx86: they both work so use your best judgement
[13:04:17] <NoiseEee> enderx86: truthfully, imo, you should have a different page for each quiz, unless you've got some crazy reason for wanting to do this all xhr
[13:04:17] <enderx86> versatiletech: what does 'both' refer to? i only outlined one plan, which is to have a separate form for each quiz and one submit button
[13:05:08] <NoiseEee> enderx86: consider that in your scenario, one cannot complete just a single quiz and decide to come back later / do the other one later / etc
[13:05:38] <enderx86> i see.
[13:05:40] <versatiletech> enderx86: well you said that they could take one or more quizzes. So you could use one form or multiple forms.
[13:10:04] <enderx86> NoiseEee: good point.
[13:10:34] <enderx86> NoiseEee: So I guess it makes sense to do an xhr to grab the 'default' form, but give (at the head of the page) the user options to select another form.
[13:11:56] <enderx86> NoiseEee: meaning that each survey comprises a form that's dynamically generated by my servlet. would it be a good idea to have a hidden input with the survey identifier? problem is, it's easy for the user to change the survey identifier with firebug, etc.
[13:12:43] <NoiseEee> enderx86: then i'd just straight-up load a page with the form already built really
[13:12:56] <NoiseEee> or make the survey identifier a hash instead of a number...
[13:13:16] <enderx86> what do you mean load a page with the form already built?
[13:13:24] <enderx86> do you mean *not* dynamically generate the form html in my servlet?
[13:15:30] <NoiseEee> i mean not build it via JS
[13:15:32] <NoiseEee> but its up to you
[13:17:13] <enderx86> how would i change the form then?
[13:18:09] <NoiseEee> load a new page? ie:  whatever.jsp?formID=x123456d
[13:18:57] <enderx86> so the 'default form' would be a built-in to the main page, but the other forms would be loaded dynamically through the servlet?
[13:19:38] <enderx86> another option would be to store the other forms as static files, and simply change the html of a div via jquery when the other form is loaded
[13:20:33] <NoiseEee> enderx86: yep
[13:20:41] <enderx86> yep to what?
[13:20:49] <NoiseEee> yep another option
[13:20:49] <enderx86> i stated two contrasting ideas :-)
[13:20:55] <NoiseEee> its really up to you
[13:21:33] <enderx86> Question: How would I store the other forms as static files? I have never seen an HTML file without <html><body></body></html>. But I'm thinking about having an HTML file with just <form>[...]</form>
[13:21:46] <NoiseEee> enderx86: that'd do
[13:22:11] <NoiseEee> $('#form').replaceWith(data.newForm)
[13:23:24] <versatiletech> enderx86: if you're loading in HTML through AJAX all you need in those static files in the HTML that should change. You don't need <html>, <head>, or <body>. Think of it as an include.
[13:24:04] <enderx86> Is the convention to still give these "include" files an HTML extension?
[13:24:22] <versatiletech> no convention. You choose what you want.
[13:24:39] <enderx86> I see, thanks.
[13:24:48] <enderx86> Thanks versatile and NoiseEee for your help + patience :-)
[13:24:54] <enderx86> also happy turkey day

[13:35:12] <dblosevn> i avertise at 80 an hour and generally sign contracts around 50-65
[13:35:14] <versatiletech> Here's some of the problems I've seen with outsourcing to India and Russia: quality, communication difficulties, and horrible at deadlines
[13:35:26] <jrockjiggz> its facinating how much a price can change on the notion of empathy
[13:35:36] <dblosevn> COMMUNICATION is the worse
[13:35:51] <jrockjiggz> versatiletech: yes, yes, and yes
[13:36:15] <dblosevn> jrockjiggz: ya im a sucker for the small guy i guess cause i am the small guy lol
[13:36:15] <versatiletech> dblosevn: I'd only take a $15 per hour job if it was guaranteed a crapload of many in the end
[13:36:21] <versatiletech> money*
[13:36:55] <versatiletech> I normally see the quality of client gets better as the rate goes higher
[13:36:57] <dblosevn> and believe me if i take a 15 dollar an hour job its going to be small i wont do a 200 hour job at15 an hour
[13:37:17] <tobago> How to assign a parameter in a unamed function for setInterval? This snippet is running: https://gist.github.com/4133010 but i don't like the 2 "this" parameters.
[13:37:55] <dblosevn> i save my high billing for my bigger clients lol, eg caterpillar i just signed a contract with them @ 50 an hour for 500 hours
[13:37:57] <djsounds02> Hey guys, I have a simple animation not working perfectly on my site, it gets the height of an element and reveals the element to that height, except some boxes are reveling to a different height, cant seem to figure it out. http://cl.ly/3O3G041q0S3q
[13:38:35] <versatiletech> dblosevn: dude you could've gotten a whole bunch higher with the same amount of hours
[13:38:58] <versatiletech> at least those hours are guaranteed
[13:38:59] <dblosevn> versatiletech: i cant i got 2 consultancy firms in front me be before cat
[13:39:19] <versatiletech> value trumps price
[13:39:36] <dblosevn> there likely paying 80-100 an hour for me
[13:40:06] <versatiletech> wait you're working with a staffing agency?
[13:40:14] <dblosevn> no lol
[13:40:26] <dblosevn> one of my clients is a consultancy firm
[13:40:26] <versatiletech> "there likely paying 80-100 an hour for me"
[13:40:35] <dblosevn> one of his clients is a marketing firm
[13:40:35] <versatiletech> ohhhhh
[13:41:14] <dblosevn> the marketing firm gets these huge deals with like CAT, target, coke etc
[13:41:35] <dblosevn> they pass all there work to the constutancy guy and im his lead dev/project manager
[13:41:45] <versatiletech> tobago: function() { myfunction( 'hello' ) } )
[13:42:01] <versatiletech> ah yes
[13:42:16] <versatiletech> marketing firms get huge deals
[13:42:33] <dblosevn> there the ones gettig the big bucks lol
[13:42:47] <versatiletech> oh yeah, signing multi-million dollar contracts
[13:42:50] <dblosevn> i quoted then 25k for the project so they likely bid 80 on it lol
[13:42:58] <versatiletech> yeap
[13:43:14] <versatiletech> making a killing on your talent
[13:43:23] <dblosevn> well its a team effort
[13:43:33] <dblosevn> theres about 12 people on the team
[13:43:54] <versatiletech> 80k sounds a little low for a 12 manned team
[13:43:54] <dblosevn> ive got a full design team hehind me
[13:44:09] <dblosevn> the other guys dont do as much as me lol
[13:44:17] <versatiletech> ha
[13:44:22] <dblosevn> the orginal project was 750k
[13:44:30] <dblosevn> i got paid about 30
[13:44:33] <versatiletech> :O
[13:44:33] <dblosevn> :-(
[13:44:40] <versatiletech> capitalism
[13:44:51] <dblosevn> they designed a showroom for them
[13:45:16] <dblosevn> built a hardware kiosk < me and an ipad app < idians
[13:45:30] <dblosevn> now im building an android port of it
[13:45:38] <versatiletech> ooh you into iOS?
[13:45:50] <dblosevn> no sadly they let the indians do that
[13:45:59] <dblosevn> i got paid for being the PM on it though
[13:46:06] <dblosevn> i do droid
[13:46:09] <dblosevn> ios is next
[13:46:35] <versatiletech> programmers say the android platform is a pain compared to ios since it's fragmented
[13:46:47] <dblosevn> i like it actually lol
[13:46:59] <dblosevn> i tried ios and droid a week apart
[13:47:09] <dblosevn> i got a working droid app in less then a week
[13:47:18] <dblosevn> i got nowhere with ios
[13:47:23] <versatiletech> really
[13:47:25] <dblosevn> ya
[13:47:58] <jrockjiggz> I tried android, couldn't get past networking...
[13:48:03] <versatiletech> I've been wanting to get into it, but I've been rather focusing on getting my skills extremely high with my current skillset
[13:48:07] <dblosevn> i guess because java is far more familiar to me then objective c
[13:48:46] <dblosevn> i know so many other laguages that are close to java that java just happened lol
[13:49:28] <versatiletech> I've been wanting to get into python/django too
[13:49:49] <versatiletech> it's so clean
[13:50:56] <dblosevn> i had an issue with ics though
[13:51:00] <dblosevn> with networking
[13:51:14] <versatiletech> ios?
[13:51:19] <dblosevn> i guess its bad practice to block while pulling a request
[13:51:32] <dblosevn> my app worked on everything pre ice cream sandwidch
[13:51:44] <dblosevn> ics and abaove crashed the app
[13:51:46] <jrockjiggz> 2.3 has greater marketshare
[13:52:25] <dblosevn> ya i targeted 2.3 and above but my app pviolated security for networking on ics+
[13:52:49] <jrockjiggz> yea I believe permissions are fragmented more finely
[13:52:58] <dblosevn> had to wrap my requests in another thread so the interface wasnt blocked during the request
[13:53:13] <jrockjiggz> yep
[13:53:18] <jrockjiggz> that got me stumped
[13:53:36] <jrockjiggz> i gave up cuz i couldn't find any answers
[13:53:44] <dblosevn> ya the error isnt very forthcoming lol
[13:53:58] <versatiletech> tobago: also I believe only setInterval in IE only takes two parameters: a function and an interval integer
[13:53:58] <jrockjiggz> theres no one way todo anything i find..
[13:54:01] <dblosevn> i just googled the error and got like 2.5mm results with solutions lol
[13:55:04] <jrockjiggz> as soon as blackberry 10 comes out jan 30th, a whole new platform to suppport (yay...)
[13:55:19] <dblosevn> oh it wasnt security it was netorking policy
[13:55:36] <dblosevn> lol, i thought blackberry died lol
[13:55:39] <platzhirsch> I have attached a function the scroll event in order to fade away a text which is on the top step by step, but if you use Page up or something similar the opacity will obvious stay the same, how can I make this relative to the scrollbar position?
[13:56:07] <jrockjiggz> ?scrollTop
[13:56:08] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[13:56:15] <tw2113> jrockjiggz, you're supporting a fruit?
[13:56:22] <dblosevn> lmao
[13:56:35] <dblosevn> i havent heard anything from RIM in a while
[13:57:13] <platzhirsch> jrockjiggz: thanks
[13:57:16] <dblosevn> RIM hasnt been able to keep up with the market in over 5 years
[13:57:44] <jrockjiggz> bb10 http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/12/blackberry-10-launch-event/
[13:58:01] <dblosevn> is it going to run android?
[13:58:06] <jrockjiggz> yes
[13:58:10] <dblosevn> thats the only thing that would save rim now
[13:58:44] <NoiseEee> its running their own OS, BB 10
[13:59:22] <dblosevn> ya no droid
[13:59:32] <dblosevn> RIM will still be dead lol
[14:00:09] <dblosevn> i used to be a die hard blackberry guy but after the storm failed me horribly i went in search of a better device
[14:00:20] <jrockjiggz> still, looking at this I think they have a fun for their money http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyIq5XeK754&feature=related
[14:00:25] <jrockjiggz> *run
[14:03:00] <versatiletech> jrockjiggz: wow multitasking is incredible
[14:03:57] <dblosevn> ya they got that, but the thing killing them is there market... nobody has cared much about RIM in years and it will take years for there market to catch up with even the android market much less itunes
[14:04:35] <dblosevn> so even if they release a killer device and a killer os it will takes years for them to realize any results from it
[14:07:10] <systemfault> Indeed... see MS
[14:07:55] <dblosevn> ya ms has win 8 to help them get the mobile marketshare though
[14:08:16] <dblosevn> win 8 is now what osx has been for years
[14:08:32] <versatiletech> I'm actually looking forward to the surface pro
[14:08:45] <versatiletech> strange that I want a Windows product
[14:08:46] <versatiletech> LOL
[14:08:49] <dblosevn> osx pushes people into itunes to buy apps which is also where they buy apps for there ios devices
[14:09:10] <dblosevn> ms finally caught on to the idea and implemented it in win 8
[14:09:43] <dblosevn> ittl still take a couple years but i bet the ms store starts seeing numbers like itunes in 2- 3 years
[14:10:46] <dblosevn> and also windows phone will probally make a jump as well in the process, they wont only be a minority anymore lol
[14:11:39] <dblosevn> doubtful windows phone will ever make it to the top of the marketshare though
[14:11:39] <tw2113> hasn't MS been trying to break into the mobile market for a few years already?
[14:11:45] <versatiletech> the only issue I see is .NET developers adapting to the whole mobile thing
[14:12:04] <versatiletech> it's a whole new experience
[14:12:16] <dblosevn> ya but struturing windows 8 after the win mobile interface was genius
[14:12:41] <dblosevn> the os sells the device now and one marketplace for all
[14:12:53] <dblosevn> i wont be buying a win phone but i can see the logic
[14:12:53] <versatiletech> yeah
[14:13:19] <dblosevn> i dont generally fall into marketing traps lol, i buy what i like and whats useful
[14:13:32] <systemfault> Weird that they pushed the zune hd UI that far.
[14:13:46] <versatiletech> dblosevn: yep, same mantra here
[14:14:30] <dblosevn> id bet though the numbers for win phone mobile jump quite a bit over  the next 2 years
[14:15:17] <versatiletech> that's why I'm actually looking forward to the surface pro, because it's a lightweight laptop/tablet which I could use as a digital notebook too with it's stylus.
[14:15:19] <dblosevn> ittl be ios, droid, win mobile within 2-3 years unless people finally grow a brain and realize they have been getting ripped off by apple for years and then it will be droid, ios, win mobile
[14:16:01] <dblosevn> did you watch gates fail when he was presenting it
[14:16:17] <dblosevn> it dead locked and they had to give him 3 different devices in the prelaunch
[14:16:26] <dblosevn> eg... surface
[14:16:45] <systemfault> gates?!?
[14:16:50] <dblosevn> yes
[14:17:04] <dblosevn> eg bill gates lol
[14:17:15] <systemfault> Ahhh, for win mobile
[14:17:18] <versatiletech> ouch, that's not the first time he had a buggy device while presenting it. I wonder if it's a marketing stunt.
[14:17:19] <versatiletech> lol
[14:17:28] <dblosevn> i seem to remember a simlar circumstance with vista
[14:17:35] <dblosevn> and we all rememebr the outcome of it
[14:17:42] <systemfault> Vista... the stupid file copy bug
[14:18:31] <dblosevn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1zxDa3t0fg
[14:18:34] <dblosevn> FAIL
[14:19:34] <versatiletech> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKtGXPfabLQ
[14:19:50] <systemfault> Classic
[14:19:54] <versatiletech> seems like they haven't learned
[14:19:59] <dblosevn> Yes lol
[14:20:51] <systemfault> Well.. that's what programming is... no?
[14:21:12] <versatiletech> whatcha mean?
[14:21:19] <dblosevn> i wouldnt try to do a launch presentation with a buggy device
[14:21:25] <systemfault> Bug.. crashes..
[14:21:48] <versatiletech> that's why you test extensively before a big presentation LOL
[14:21:50] <systemfault> A lot of people here complain when they have bugs in their 50 lines of js..
[14:22:09] <dblosevn> ya lol, but they are getting paid millions to build an os
[14:22:21] <enderx86> I have to ask about my web survey again. I'd like to store questions + answers on the server-side, and render the form on the client-side, that way theoretically different frontends could be substituted. How would I go about generating a survey of N (variable) questions on the client-side? In JavaScript?
[14:22:58] <enderx86> For example, there could be 10 questions for one quiz, 5 questions for another, it's variable. Although all will have numeric answers from 1 to 10.
[14:23:11] <enderx86> Would I use JavaScript and loops to create this?
[14:23:13] <dblosevn> enderx86: youd start with the server generating n random questions and delivering them to the front end to be rendered
[14:23:38] <enderx86> Right. As a JSON. But they have to be rendered client-side. So I'd use JS to do this, or JSP templates? (I have no experience with JSP whatsoever.)
[14:24:00] <enderx86> My thought is that using templates would involve the server-side more than I would like...
[14:24:14] <dblosevn> i wouldnt make the client determine what questions to display id make the client render the questions the server sends to the client
[14:24:19] <systemfault> Why would you use JSP (Java) for a survey?
[14:24:34] <enderx86> I'm using Java servlets, not JSP.
[14:24:37] <systemfault> Masochism?
[14:24:50] <enderx86> Masochism = Java servlets or JSP or both?
[14:24:54] <systemfault> Both.
[14:25:05] <enderx86> B/c my job is Java development
[14:25:27] <systemfault> Ok.. It's just that I'm a fan of the "Use the right tool for the job" philosophy :P
[14:25:53] <enderx86> What would be the right tool here? Python? PHP? Ruby?
[14:26:30] <systemfault> It's not important :P In any case, write your survey without AJAX then use it after to make the UX better
[14:26:45] <systemfault> enderx86: I'd probably use a shitty language like PHP
[14:26:58] <systemfault> I leave Java for important stuff :P
[14:27:13] <enderx86> like what?
[14:27:37] <systemfault> Systems dealing with money... HTTP-based (RESTful) APIs.. etc.
[14:27:58] <enderx86> I see.
[14:28:07] <enderx86> But how would I go about rendering the survey client-side? Using JS?
[14:28:28] <enderx86> Looping through each question in the JSON and rendering it as a form question?
[14:28:52] <dblosevn> if it doesnt have to be async, i would just render the html on the serverside
[14:28:56] <systemfault> enderx86: You would create some HTTP RPCs that would return JSON... then on the client side, you would use something like a backbone.js (Javascript MVC) to create the views
[14:29:05] <versatiletech> enderx86: whatever gets the job done now and in the future and gives you the least amount of headache. Of course, that's if you have a choice of what language to use.
[14:29:19] <systemfault> enderx86: For a survey, I'd probably do everything server-side
[14:29:28] <dblosevn> ^^ ++
[14:29:54] <enderx86> Thanks guys!
[14:29:57] <enderx86> Happy thanksgiving.
[14:29:59] <dblosevn> no need in the extra requests
[14:30:33] <dblosevn> ya happy thanksgiving guys :-)
[14:31:30] <platzhirsch> I have bound a function event to a certain css class and I change with $(this).fadeTo the opacity, however, the opacity of all the elements from this class is changed and not only from the element on which the event is triggered
[14:31:33] <platzhirsch> how can I limit this?
[14:32:23] <systemfault> platzhirsch: Impossible to tell with the huge amount of code we can see.
[14:32:25] <dblosevn> platzhirsch: that shouldnt happen
[14:32:37] <dblosevn> definitely need an example
[14:33:15] <dblosevn> the only way that could happen is if all the other ones were children of $(this)
[14:34:32] <dblosevn> well not necissarily children.... decendants of
[14:35:34] <FrameFever> anybody familiar with css here?
[14:35:53] <dblosevn> i bet theres ton of people familar withh css in #css?
[14:35:58] <versatiletech> platzhirsch: yeah we'll need an example. It could be as simple as adding opacity: 1 to all of the descents selector * {}
[14:36:14] <FrameFever> everybody is sleeping there
[14:36:38] <dblosevn> ?ask @FrameFever
[14:36:38] <bot-t> FrameFever, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:37:04] <dblosevn> if we can help we will :-)
[14:37:37] <FrameFever> http://jsfiddle.net/tJ5gq/1/
[14:37:56] <FrameFever> I applied a margin to div "B"
[14:38:14] <versatiletech> anyone know of reliable sources of passive income using our skills?
[14:38:15] <FrameFever> but why is this margin not inside the childs of A
[14:38:20] <platzhirsch> dblosevn: it was the descendents problem
[14:38:32] <platzhirsch> just didn't notice because I was sloppy
[14:38:39] <FrameFever> so that the C is placed over B
[14:38:46] <dblosevn> platzhirsch: :-)
[14:39:05] <FrameFever> what I want to achieve is that the div C is placed above the div B
[14:39:13] <FrameFever> not over
[14:39:26] <FrameFever> inside
[14:39:53] <dblosevn> looking ...
[14:40:00] <systemfault> FrameFever: add overflow: hidden; to #A
[14:40:49] <systemfault> FrameFever: If you care to know why: http://colinaarts.com/articles/the-magic-of-overflow-hidden/
[14:41:13] <FrameFever> wow
[14:41:37] <FrameFever> but it doesn't make sense
[14:42:40] <systemfault> Read the damn article.
[14:43:07] <versatiletech> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[14:43:19] <dblosevn> ah specifically the section on collapsing margins
[14:43:25] <versatiletech> the article's heading is "But it doesnâ€™t make sense!"
[14:46:01] <dblosevn> thats cool ++ for systemfault: i learned something new today yay
[14:46:49] <versatiletech> systemfault: same here I didn't know overflow:hidden was good for position:absolute. I always used it for floats.
[14:47:05] <versatiletech> because of the margin's collapsing
[14:48:14] <dblosevn> i always just used it to implement my own scrolling on a contaqiner was unaware it had so many other uses
[14:48:24] <systemfault> :)
[14:49:13] <versatiletech> one more cool thing in my CSS toolbox
[14:49:14] <versatiletech> :D
[14:50:24] <dns-away> sounds good
[15:11:09] <sunbeam> when (this) is a ul, and i need to get the direct li child of it with class .opened
[15:11:19] <sunbeam> how can i best get this?
[15:12:55] <dns-away> you can use $('ul li.opened') instead (this)
[15:13:31] <sunbeam> jQuery(this).closest("li.nav-controls").parent("ul").
[15:13:37] <sunbeam> dns-away: how in this context?
[15:13:41] <sunbeam> after parent("ul")
[15:15:54] <dns-away> $(this).children('li').attr('class'))  this shows only the first element of the list
[15:16:55] <dns-away> You can use jQuery(this).closest("li.nav-controls").parent("ul").children('li.ClassName')
[15:17:38] <scathen^C> anybody know how to fit a group of images in a constant size div, removing whitespace by scale/cropping, but in doing so minimising cropping as much as possible?
[15:17:41] <sunbeam> dns-away: yes
[15:17:50] <sunbeam> dns-away: but i only want the first layer
[15:17:53] <sunbeam> so ul li and not
[15:17:55] <sunbeam> ul ul li
[15:18:46] <coldhead> ul > li
[15:19:05] <Hopsy> hi coldhead :D
[15:19:08] <dns-away> .first() ::)
[15:19:10] <sunbeam> ehm
[15:19:11] <sunbeam> yes
[15:19:13] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:19:13] <sunbeam> sorry
[15:19:23] <Hopsy> I am still getting notifications haha
[15:19:48] <oldhead> better?
[15:20:44] <dblosevn> $(this).find('li.opened') @sunbeam
[15:21:40] <dblosevn> would find all decendants of ul (this) with class li.opened
[15:23:03] <sunbeam> its a litte more different
[15:23:05] <sunbeam> jQuery(this).closest("li.nav-controls").parent("ul").children("li.visible-primary").removeClass('visible-primary');
[15:23:20] <sunbeam> this is what i have now, but i only need DIRECT li children from this ul
[15:24:09] <dblosevn> sunbeam: everytime i answer a question for you you always change the question why dont you ask the real question first?
[15:25:27] <dblosevn> .chidren will only give you direct decendants on ul
[15:25:32] <dblosevn> *children
[15:25:43] <sunbeam> hmm strange
[15:25:46] <dblosevn> .find will find all decendants
[15:25:48] <sunbeam> sorry ill try to be more clear
[15:26:07] <dns-away> any twitter dev for small help ? -)
[15:26:23] <dblosevn> eg ul#parent li ul li.opened
[15:26:43] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/fc6ix7Sk
[15:26:48] <sunbeam> this is what i do now
[15:26:52] <dblosevn> $('#parent').children('.opened') will not match anything
[15:27:26] <dblosevn> $('#parent').find('li.opened') will match something
[15:27:43] <sunbeam> dblosevn: you see what i do wrong from that paste?
[15:28:01] <sunbeam> dblosevn: why wont it match?
[15:30:22] <dblosevn> looking
[15:30:30] <sunbeam> for some reason this code
[15:30:33] <sunbeam> removes all .visible-primary
[15:30:43] <sunbeam> also of ul li ul li.visible-primary
[15:31:59] <dblosevn> paste me soem markup too
[15:36:50] <sunbeam> sec
[15:37:32] <versatiletech> systemfault: ah, after messing around with the http://jsfiddle.net/tJ5gq/1/ I noticed that I didn't actually learn something new. The reason the #C is over #B is because the margins on #B are pushing it down to make it look as if #C is over it. Putting overflow:hidden on the parent div just makes sure that the margins don't collapse. I thought #C somehow was put back into the document flow with the overflow:hidden, but that's not the case.
[15:37:49] <versatiletech> http://jsfiddle.net/tJ5gq/2/
[15:38:20] <versatiletech> good reminder for me though
[15:39:42] <versatiletech> dns-away: what's up with twitter?
[15:40:37] <dns-away> nothing, thanks for help. just i'll solve the problem

[15:41:05] <sunbeam> where can i find console.log in chrome?
[15:41:12] <sunbeam> nvm

[16:08:29] <dblosevn> lol i know right
[16:58:11] <khaan> hi everybody - did anyone ever use hammer.js library?
[17:42:35] <coldhead> so quiet
[17:52:45] <[RandomCoder]> I have an input element (type=text) which sits in div (the div expands on click). how can I allow clicking on the input element and using it as normal whilst preventing the click event of the parent div?
[18:06:45] <relipse>  I have an odd question, I am attempting to repaint a input type=submit by doing $(window).resize(function() {  $(".bigButton").css("z-index", 1);  }); in order to change the font size, but it does not get repainted until I click down on the button (then the text size changes) Is there a way to make the text size change without clicking down on the button
[18:12:40] <howardgrigg> hi guys - there is likely a tidier way of doing this rather than using 4 .parent()s in a row http://pastie.org/5421166
[18:12:58] <coldhead> ?closest @ howardgrigg
[18:12:58] <bot-t> howardgrigg, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:13:15] <howardgrigg> oh awesome :)
[18:13:25] <coldhead> also cache the selector
[18:13:35] <coldhead> var $ancestor = $(this).closest('.whatever')
[18:13:43] <coldhead> then just use $ancestor.find(whatever)
[18:13:50] <coldhead> rather than retyping it again and again
[18:14:06] <howardgrigg> perfect I knew i was doing it wrong/ugly
[18:14:10] <howardgrigg> thanks
[18:14:17] <coldhead> good instinct!
[18:14:23] <coldhead> thanks for caring about elegance <3
[18:16:31] <[RandomCoder]>  I have an input element (type=text) which sits in div (the div expands on click). how can I allow clicking on the input element and using it as normal whilst preventing the click event of the parent div?
[18:18:10] <coldhead> $('input').click(function (e) { e.stopPropagation() })
[18:18:16] <coldhead> ?stopPropagation
[18:18:16] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[18:18:20] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[18:18:20] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[18:18:23] <coldhead> ?fweep
[18:18:23] <bot-t> coldhead, BLAM
[18:18:49] <[RandomCoder]> yeah I tried that
[18:19:04] <coldhead> you maybe tried it wrong?
[18:19:06] <[RandomCoder]> it stops the parent event firing but the input element can no longer be used
[18:19:08] <[RandomCoder]> possibly
[18:19:34] <[RandomCoder]> $(this).prev().click(function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); });
[18:21:02] <coldhead> it works here http://jsfiddle.net/NF9fY/
[18:21:41] <[RandomCoder]> hmmm wth is going on then :)
[18:21:54] <coldhead> better example http://jsfiddle.net/NF9fY/2/
[18:21:56] <relipse> hey coldhead: can you do me a favor and login to http://cworklog.com u:test116 p:test116 click the little clock icon with the gray arrow (which will pop up a timer) and tell me why/how to make my start/stop button flush against the top of the window (it has a margin for some reason)
[18:22:04] <coldhead> $(this).next() is probably matching the wrong thing
[18:22:07] <coldhead> oh god relipse
[18:22:10] <coldhead> this again
[18:22:20] <coldhead> I TRY TO MOVE ON BUT YOU KEEP PULLING ME BACK IN
[18:22:48] <relipse> move on?
[18:23:00] <relipse> the problem is my whole site is password protected
[18:23:52] <[RandomCoder]> damn
[18:23:58] <[RandomCoder]> that's exactly what it is, I'm an idiot
[18:24:07] <coldhead> relipse: you have different font sizes
[18:24:13] <coldhead> which is probably changing the spacing
[18:24:25] <[RandomCoder]> because the stoppropagation was working and the input was not, I assumed i'd selected the right thing. thanks coldhead
[18:24:50] <relipse> coldhead: what do you mean?
[18:24:59] <coldhead> 13px/1.231 arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif vs "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
[18:25:17] <coldhead> happy hacking [RandomCoder]
[18:26:24] <relipse> so what should I do?
[18:26:46] <coldhead> i would try adding theme.css to the other page
[18:26:51] <coldhead> which doesn't seem to have it
[18:27:02] <coldhead> or fonts.min.css to the first page
[18:27:12] <coldhead> include the same styles in both is my point
[18:28:30] <[RandomCoder]> got the selector right and problem remains. if I add $(this).focus(); after stopProp... it works. good enough for me
[18:29:44] <scathen^C> hey guys, i am trying to fit a bunch of images within a div (can scale/crop), maximising the aethetic appeal. Surely this has been done before, I just cannot find anything useful. Any ideas?
[18:31:09] <coldhead> scathen^C: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10930783/mosaic-grid-gallery-with-dynamic-sized-images has a few i would have mentioned, and a few i haven't heard of
[18:31:47] <coldhead> i am not aware of something that resizes images for you to make them beautiful, that's too much aesthetics for an unfeeling gombuter
[18:32:10] <scathen^C> thanks coldhead
[18:32:22] <coldhead> good luck sir
[18:32:24] <coldhead> or madam
[18:32:37] <scathen^C> all i meant was visually pleasing (ie. minimise cropping where possible)
[18:33:46] <coldhead> if (! visuallyPleasing()) { moreBeauty++ }
[18:33:55] <coldhead> shoot, that should have been while()
[18:35:36] <relipse> coldhead: ok I added <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/stylesheet.css" /> and it fixed the problem if the button says "Start" but not if it says "Stop" and the background is red
[18:35:47] <coldhead> yeesh
[18:36:08] <coldhead> that's probably because the text has slightly different lengths
[18:36:19] <coldhead> i would assign a specific CSS width to that element
[18:36:24] <coldhead> so it will look the same whatever it says
[18:38:08] <[RandomCoder]> if (! visuallyPleasing()) { $('#wife').divorce(); }
[18:38:42] <relipse> coldhead: i tried 100%
[18:38:57] <coldhead> if (! visuallyPleasing()) { $('#wife').removeAttr('married'); }
[18:39:02] <coldhead> so offensive
[18:39:05] <coldhead> relipse: that is too much
[18:39:12] <coldhead> i would go for 100px or something
[18:40:05] <[RandomCoder]> lol
[18:40:26] <relipse> i need it to resize when the user resizes the window coldhead
[18:40:50] <relipse> like on android
[18:40:52] <coldhead> oh so a percentage then maybe
[18:40:54] <relipse> i need it to fill the whole screen
[18:40:57] <coldhead> 10%
[18:41:11] <relipse> no i need it to fill the whole screen for androids
[18:41:27] <coldhead> try ##css, relipse
[18:41:33] <coldhead> i know very little about CSS or mobile
[18:41:51] <relipse> ok going to try this on my mobile
[19:02:41] <dblosevn> coldhead: if only it were that easy lmao
[19:04:03] <coder7of9> can someone recommend a solid and impressive flip plugin. something which flips the div to reveal its backside. then can flip it back.
[19:04:23] <coder7of9> its backside being another div but it appears like its backside
[19:04:44] <coder7of9> i have searched and tried many. but i cannot find a solid one.
[19:06:19] <dblosevn> ?g jquery flip effect @coder7of9
[19:06:21] <bot-t> coder7of9, Flippy : flip effect jQuery Plugin | Guilhem Marty - http://blog.guilhemmarty.com/flippy/
[19:06:30] <dblosevn> first result on google...
[19:09:12] <coder7of9> mm i will look at this one again
[19:09:21] <coder7of9> thanks
[19:09:29] <dblosevn> the demo seems to work flawlessly
[19:13:31] <coder7of9> yes but no IE support pre 8
[19:13:47] <versatiletech> not surprising
[19:13:54] <dblosevn> your not going to get this efeect pre ie9
[19:14:16] <dblosevn> it can only be achieved with flash before ie9 as it didnt support canvas
[19:15:07] <coder7of9> yes i have it in ie7. even for flippy. but only if i can trust ie virtual browser thing
[19:15:28] <coder7of9> but i can do something alternative for ie7
[19:15:31] <dblosevn> he siad he implemented excanvas for versions of ie before 9
[19:15:42] <coder7of9> mm that is why
[19:20:27] <coder7of9> is excanvas reliable?
[19:20:27] <howardgrigg> hey again - any ideas why the response of this ajax request isn't being inserted into the page? the alert(html) shows me that it's getting the correct response http://beta.pastie.org/5421352
[19:22:53] <howardgrigg> hah the wonders of a missing .
[19:23:06] <howardgrigg> dont worry found the issue
[19:23:17] <versatiletech> yeah I was about to point that out
[19:35:11] <coldhead> when will clients learn
[19:35:16] <versatiletech> never
[19:35:48] <coldhead> it's very sad
[19:39:52] <versatiletech> what they do this time?
[19:47:02] <Heather_> how can remove a specific element inside the matched element and still keep the string e.g <p id="someid"><strong>sometext</strong></p> and I want to remove strong by selecting someid.
[19:48:25] <coldhead> var str = $('#someid strong').html(); $('#someid strong').remove();
[19:48:38] <coldhead> possibly you want to use ?outerhtml
[19:48:38] <bot-t> jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[19:51:57] <coldhead> you are welcome
[19:52:01] <Heather_> thanks
[19:52:21] <jrodl3r> gobble-robbel
[19:52:27] <coldhead> quite

[20:00:55] <jrodl3r> mmmmhm
[20:12:34] <nachooo> Hello!
[20:20:13] <mindful> Hey guys. I understand that making an asynchronous ajax request on page unload is theoretically impossible and I know I'm pushing the limits, but let's say that I needed to transmit information (through ajax) when the page unloads ... I do not need nor care about the answer, would there be a way to make sure the request is at least sent before the page unloads, without blocking the browser until I get an answer ?
[20:22:36] * black_warlock gnight
[20:32:18] * black_warlock im fookin gona splat the bed
[20:33:30] <coldhead> don't make your mother clean it up
[20:33:33] <coldhead> that sainted woman
[20:34:05] <coldhead> mindful: i don't think so, you can only hope for the best
[21:12:59] <enderx86> Question: When everything can be done with single-page manipulation (AJAX), why not just have every website be a single page? What's the need to have more than one URL?
[21:14:17] <coldhead> javascript might be disabled
[21:14:23] <coldhead> sites are crawled better without JS
[21:14:51] <coldhead> cacheing (generally) works better in the traditional model
[21:15:24] <coldhead> the traditional model works better with non-browser clients (scrapers, proxies etc)
[21:15:49] <coldhead> plus sometimes it's nice just to keep things simple
[21:16:55] * coldhead np: tarantel - steede bonnet
[21:29:57] <GoSox> So if i have a box that shows and hides without any animation, should I bother checking if it's already visible or invisible when I'm showing/hiding it. Or does it not matter, and I can just send it a show/hide even if it's already in that state.
[21:40:13] <coldhead> i wouldn't bother checking, GoSox
[21:40:20] <coldhead> that's for jQUery to worry about
[21:40:35] <coldhead> if it's hidden and yu say hide() then everything will work out fine
[21:41:01] <GoSox> i just want to avoid any unforeseen problems, including possible animation flickers, if that would cause any
[21:41:23] <coldhead> no, jquery will see it's already hidden and bail out
[21:41:28] <GoSox> and it all might be for not, because after posting my initial question 13 minutes ago, i've decided that it might look better to use a .show('slow') feature to zoom this box in the first time
[21:41:29] <coldhead> jquery is lazy like that
[21:41:32] <GoSox> good
[21:41:40] <enderx86> coldhead: thanks for the responses. just read them.
[21:42:03] <nachooo> guys, is there any way to improve this code? http://jsfiddle.net/wXgFm/16/
[21:44:08] <coldhead> that's pretty sharp, nachooo
[21:44:17] <coldhead> i would do the last bit this way http://jsfiddle.net/wXgFm/17/
[21:44:25] <coldhead> which might run slightly faster
[21:44:30] <coldhead> but it's a matter of taste
[21:44:41] <nachooo> coldhead: awesome, yeah, I need speed
[21:45:01] <nachooo> coldhead: because it will work with bunch of images and I'm calculating the ratio of each of them, so it's a mess
[21:45:19] <nachooo> coldhead: I spent all day trying to do this with CSS but no luck
[21:45:28] <GoSox> nachooo: i used a similar technique, except I do it in CSS, where the image is the background, and it's bigger than the box so it gets cropped when you resize. not exactly the same thing, but a similar effect and much lighter code
[21:45:57] <nachooo> GoSox: oh yeah, even with a fixed height like my example?
[21:46:13] <coldhead> nachooo: if you're trying to make it faster you might defer the actual CSS manipulations and do them all at the end, after the each loop
[21:46:20] <coldhead> but that will be less readable
[21:46:31] <GoSox> nachooo: yeah, but i don't resize the image
[21:46:31] <GoSox> http://www.fellsbiker.com/photos/
[21:47:04] <GoSox> see for yourself. that's also an old page so I'm sure I could improve it now, if I felt like improving it. but the little tiles resize with the page and just crop their background images accordingly
[21:47:13] <nachooo> GoSox: I see, that's a good solution, but in my case won't work, I need the image to resize
[21:48:02] <nachooo> coldhead: mm, what?
[21:48:33] <coldhead> nachooo: what you have now goes: do some math, set some css, do some math, set some css, etc etc
[21:48:40] <coldhead> it will probably look better to do
[21:48:49] <coldhead> do math, do math, do math, do css, do css, do css
[21:49:08] <coldhead> you might be able to reduce the number of reflows that way
[21:49:09] <nachooo> coldhead: I get it, I also need to fix the selectors here
[21:49:58] <coldhead> this is cool GoSox
[21:50:01] <GoSox> ?
[21:50:12] <coldhead> i am forwarding image resizing/layout questions to you from now on
[21:50:17] <GoSox> me?
[21:50:22] <coldhead> yes
[21:50:29] <GoSox> good luck with that :P
[21:50:46] <nachooo> oh, I have a noob question
[21:51:02] <GoSox> if you want to forward questions to me, forward your "why should I make variable width websites over fixed width websites" questions to me :D
[21:51:04] <dblosevn> go noobs :-)
[21:51:14] <GoSox> and the answer is simple, you don't know how big my browser is
[21:52:11] <coldhead> all browsers are 960
[21:52:15] <coldhead> i read that somewhere
[21:52:19] <GoSox> heh
[21:52:22] <coldhead> possibly on a bathroom wall
[21:52:27] <nachooo> how can I fix these selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/ggLJ9/
[21:52:35] <GoSox> i've always made variable width websites, that's why i still use tables for layout on some older sites
[21:52:49] <GoSox> you can talk floats all you want, that won't make them stop sucking
[21:53:39] <coldhead> nachooo: var image = $('img', container);â€‹
[21:53:39] <dblosevn> nachooo: you definitely didnt lie, that was a noob question how bout telling us what you were trying to do with that?
[21:53:42] <coldhead> slightly faster
[21:54:30] <nachooo> coldhead: $('img', container); ? what's the second value, I didn't know that you could do that
[21:54:46] <dblosevn> the seconr param is the parent
[21:54:53] <dblosevn> *second
[21:55:13] <nachooo> dblosevn: yeah, sorry if it was too noob, but I just learned that 1 min ago
[21:55:14] <enderx86> I want to have five links spaced evenly on the same row across the top of my page. How to do this?
[21:55:17] <coldhead> nachooo: it tells jquery where to start searching
[21:55:59] <coldhead> enderx86: w = $(window).width() / 5; $('#header a').width(w);
[21:56:07] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[21:56:15] <nachooo> thank you guys, I think I'm happy with the code and the results now, thanks
[21:56:21] <enderx86> is it best to do in jquery? or is there a better/faster css solution?
[21:56:28] <enderx86> javacsript* not jquery
[21:56:28] <coldhead> WE'VE TAKEN THIS LONG SO WHY SO STARRY EYED
[21:56:37] <coldhead> i've never found a CSS way to do that, enderx86
[21:56:39] <coldhead> oh wait
[21:56:42] <coldhead> width: 20%;
[21:56:46] <coldhead> lol
[21:56:49] <dblosevn> lol
[21:57:00] <coldhead> sorry, it's my first day using CSS
[21:57:01] <dblosevn> thought you could do math now in css3?
[21:57:08] <enderx86> so just #header a { width: 20% }
[21:57:11] <enderx86> ?
[21:57:19] <coldhead> sure, give that a shot
[21:57:25] <enderx86> but which is faster, more efficient?
[21:57:34] <coldhead> the css!
[21:57:40] <enderx86> in general, which is faster, easier-to-read, easier-to-maintain: javascript or css?
[21:57:43] <coldhead> faster, less code and works without JS
[21:57:45] <dblosevn> css will always be faster then js
[21:57:53] <gear4> CSS
[21:58:00] <enderx86> i see
[21:58:10] <coldhead> guys do you need to look at this again? http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[21:58:23] <coldhead> this thanksgiving i am thankful for ^
[21:58:35] <dblosevn> sick @coldhead
[21:59:22] <GoSox> thats cool
[21:59:56] <GoSox> coldhead: does css have options for timed effects? like a rotation that repeats every # seconds?
[21:59:56] <dblosevn> i would totally make that my desktop background lmao
[22:00:14] <GoSox> i use javascript to rotate an icon to give me an animated spinner
[22:00:16] <coldhead> yes, in css3 GoSox
[22:00:23] <GoSox> works well, but, if i can do it without the JS, even better
[22:00:30] <coldhead> google for css3 transitions
[22:00:43] <coldhead> there's a transition-interval or something
[22:00:45] <GoSox> the transition is easy, what about timing/repeating a transition
[22:00:46] <GoSox> ahh
[22:00:49] <coldhead> transition-repeat
[22:00:56] <coldhead> something
[22:01:05] <GoSox> thats cool
[22:01:08] <GoSox> IE9?
[22:01:21] <ColKurtz> nope
[22:01:25] <GoSox> figures
[22:01:31] <ColKurtz> ie10
[22:01:31] <coldhead> http://cssdeck.com/labs/pure-css3-super-mario-bitmap-graphics
[22:02:13] <ColKurtz> transitions are awesome as hell though
[22:02:33] <ColKurtz> I just implemented this on a website I'm working on: http://sequencejs.com/
[22:02:42] <ColKurtz> it's awesome
[22:06:17] <GoSox> css shadows aren't really shadows, not in the photoshop sense of they word
[22:06:22] <GoSox> they're just outter-glows
[22:06:35] <GoSox> works great over a solid color, looks kind of shitty over content
[22:17:11] <enderx86> coldhead: #header a { width: 20%; } didn't do it
[22:17:55] <dblosevn> #header has to have a width as well as #headers parents
[22:19:00] <dblosevn> otherwise #header a {width: 20%;} is 20% of 0
[22:19:37] <enderx86> i tried #header { width: 100%; } and that didn't work
[22:19:56] <dblosevn> you need body, #header { width: 100%;}
[22:20:39] <dblosevn> assuming #header is a child of only body
[22:21:06] <dblosevn> if #header is inside of a wrapper it also needs a width of 100%
[22:21:32] <dblosevn> otherwise #header { width: 100%; } is 100% of 0
[22:22:24] <enderx86> this is what i have: http://pastebin.com/v922uY9X
[22:24:55] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/8yX6q/
[22:25:03] <dblosevn> padding is whats killing it
[22:27:22] <dblosevn> actually, its the result div killing it
[22:27:33] <zc> ahora que
[22:27:39] <zc> esto que es?
[22:27:50] <coldhead> si amigo
[22:30:18] <GoSox> haha my idea with this new website redesign was to make it like a green facebook
[22:30:31] <GoSox> i might have done TOO good a job :)

[22:31:05] <dblosevn> @enderx86
[22:33:08] <coldhead> great work everyone, why don't you take 5
[22:33:16] <dblosevn> lol
[22:33:29] <GoSox> whats the best 'even't to use when you want to act on something being typed into a form input?
[22:33:31] <dblosevn> 5 matches in bloack ops 2 lol
[22:33:38] <dblosevn> keyup
[22:34:13] <dblosevn> or change if you want to act after they get done typing it and leave the field
[22:36:19] <dblosevn> enderx86: the problem you were having is `a` is not a block level element so you had to change it to display: inline-block as you needed to be both inline and also block
[22:37:08] <coldhead> thanks goddess for inline-block
[22:37:24] <dblosevn> whos the goddess?
[22:37:47] <GoSox> so script tags in my document <head>, does jquery have to come before my own scripts that use jquery, or are browsers smart enough to figure it all otu?
[22:38:12] <dblosevn> javascript is loaded in order
[22:38:12] <coldhead> some kind of cow i believe
[22:38:18] <coldhead> or Isis
[22:38:32] <dblosevn> you must load dependancys first
[22:39:15] <dblosevn> other wise you will get either $ or jQuery is undefined
[22:39:21] <GoSox> yup
[22:39:25] <GoSox> thats what i'm getting
[22:39:35] <dblosevn> then load jquery first lol
[22:39:45] <enderx86> dblosevn: i was able to do it with float: left
[22:39:46] <GoSox> yeah i'm updating all my pages now
[22:40:07] <enderx86> dblosevn: i switched to li's and used display: block and float: left
[22:40:17] <dblosevn> enderx86: ya floating an element makes it block level
[22:40:28] <enderx86> what exactly is 'block level'?
[22:40:41] <dblosevn> can be sized and positioned
[22:41:33] <dblosevn> ?g css block level element @enderx86
[22:41:35] <bot-t> enderx86, CSS 101: block-level elements - http://www.css-101.org/block-level-elements/index.php
[22:44:31] <GoSox> so i'm not getting any console errors, BUT, this simple little line is not activating when I type in the search box?
[22:44:32] <GoSox> $("#search_box").keyup(function()
[22:44:33] <GoSox> 	{ alert("HEY!"); });
[22:47:24] <coldhead> GoSox: try keypress instead of keyup
[22:47:47] <GoSox> nada
[22:49:55] <dblosevn> dblosevn: test
[22:51:45] <GoSox> can you have multiple 			$(function(){}); in a script? one in a script tag in teh header of a page, and another in an included javascript document in a page?
[22:51:50] <dblosevn_test> dblosevn: hey
[22:52:12] <coldhead> weird
[22:52:19] <coldhead> yes you can GoSox
[22:52:22] <coldhead> i often do
[22:52:31] <dblosevn_test> dblosevn: hey
[22:53:22] <GoSox> ok finally i'm getting somewhere
[22:53:30] <dblosevn_test> dblosevn: hey
[22:53:49] <dblosevn> finally got it to work lol
[22:54:56] <dblosevn> GoSox: yes and the will be executed in the order they are called
[22:55:09] <dblosevn> *they
[22:56:29] <enderx86> dblosevn: i got my css code from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/276324/css-horizontal-navigation-spacing. i got it from the second answer by mercutio. i'm curious, though, why you even need to include 'display: block'. it works perfectly fine without it, and 'display: block' seems to be at odds with the purpose of float.
[22:58:16] <dblosevn> enderx86: its best practice to include it as you need to be able to size the element
[22:59:16] <enderx86> why is it necessary to include it for that purpose?
[22:59:24] <enderx86> you can't size the element w/o 'display: block'?
[22:59:27] <GoSox> so here's an odd thing. I have a .keypress() event. And on that even, I assign the value of the input (the one the .keypress() is bound to) to a variable. It appears teh .value of the input doesn't include the new character yet?
[23:00:16] <dblosevn> no keypress is about the equivalent of keydown its not in the box yet
[23:00:41] <dblosevn> you can get the key they pressed from the event object
[23:00:57] <GoSox> so whats the best even to use for a search as you type thing? i want to search for whatever isin the box, any time the contents of the box changes
[23:01:08] <dblosevn> enderx86: no you cant
[23:01:37] <coldhead> no U cant
[23:02:11] <enderx86> coldhead: is there an emphasis on the U?
[23:03:01] <GoSox> so i guess i want onkeyup
[23:03:33] <coldhead> i can emphasise cant if you prefer
[23:03:37] <coldhead> but that's getting offensive
[23:04:01] <GoSox> hmm keyup catches things i don't want, like modifiers and returns
[23:05:24] <GoSox> is there a way I can do a keypress event, then do something like doDefaultAction(), and then do my own stuff?
[23:09:19] <coldhead> isn't that what keypress does? http://jsfiddle.net/rtmpR/
[23:10:57] <GoSox> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/rtmpR/1/
[23:16:08] <coldhead> well i'm stumped
[23:16:16] <coldhead> i don't know my ,s from my .s anymore
[23:16:20] <coldhead> and i miss lisp
[23:24:23] <dblosevn> test
[23:29:37] <coldhead> have fun dblosevn
[23:29:59] <dblosevn> ?
[23:30:18] <dblosevn> im trying to get my irc client acting the way i want it too lol
[23:30:51] <dblosevn> just about go it, just trying to get +nicks to show a different color
[23:32:11] <dblosevn> bot-t: hello
[23:32:12] <bot-t> dblosevn, :)
[23:32:39] <dblosevn> bot-t: yay
[23:32:43] <bot-t> dblosevn, test-case-adamh.html on Ticket #3848 – Attachment – jQuery Core ... - Should alert("Yay, it works"); alerts, "WHY AM I SELECTED?" http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/3848/test-case-adamh.html
[23:33:03] <dblosevn> not exactly what i want but it will do
[23:34:19] <dblosevn> bot-t: hello
[23:34:20] <bot-t> dblosevn, :)
[23:34:41] <GoSox> if i'm using the bind function, hooked to a specific ID, why do I have to specify the html tag too? or do I not?
[23:34:44] <dblosevn> coolness
[23:34:59] <GoSox> oh nevermind forget what i just said
[23:35:15] <dblosevn> GoSox: its pointless to specify the tag name when using an id
[23:35:35] <GoSox> i totally misunderstood what i was doing for a second, my question didn't even make sense
[23:35:44] <GoSox> moving along . . .
[23:35:46] <dblosevn> ^^ I agree lol
[23:37:33] <GoSox> is there a way to add a class that won't duplicate if an element already has that class assigned?
[23:37:58] <GoSox> i mean, without doing a manual hasClass() check first
[23:38:08] <dblosevn> GoSox: explain a bit, i dont think addClass will add the same class trwice
[23:38:15] <GoSox> oh it won't?
[23:38:17] <dblosevn> *twice
[23:38:23] <dblosevn> pretty sure it wont
[23:38:24] <GoSox> i assumed it woudl jsut keep taking it on
