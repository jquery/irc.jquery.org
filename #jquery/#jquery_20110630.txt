[00:11:00] <emil-malmoe> i fucking love jQuery
[00:11:33] <emil-malmoe> or at least i think so. seems like very little code can achive so much :)
[00:12:38] <JKarsrud> emil-malmoe: that's kinda the point :) Remove all the quirks that you shouldn't necessarily have to worry about :)
[00:16:07] <emil-malmoe> thats just so good. it's a waste of time styling for example tables in php (or asp or ruby or whatever)
[00:22:54] <iszak> coldhead, !!!! <3
[00:25:09] <iszak> :< no love
[00:33:43] <Murugaratham> is there any good resource on writing your own javascript library which consists of some jQuery functions?
[00:37:38] <skamikaze> Murugaratham: I'd base that on jqueryui - http://jqueryui.com/docs/Developer_Guide
[00:50:18] <Leak_> Hi
[00:50:31] <toxz> is this right? $('td:not(.noffer)') ?
[00:51:26] <Leak_> What is the way to display a different element when the user select an option from a select (html) ? Need to display it in real time. What I need to use ? Only JS ?
[00:51:27] <bot-t1> Leak_, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[00:52:32] <toxz> my question is answered - i had an typing error
[00:58:11] <coldhead> iszak, !!!! <3
[00:58:20] <iszak> YAY
[00:58:22] <ray73864> i'm having a bit of trouble with a zebra striping, normally i just do: $(".row:odd").css("background-color", "LightGrey"); and it works, however, with this particular table i am working on, i need to have groups of 3 <tr>'s coloured the same
[00:58:24] <iszak> coldhead, I'm leaving you :<
[00:58:33] <coldhead> oh noes
[00:58:39] <coldhead> I CAN CHANGE BABY
[00:58:46] <coldhead> I DIDN'T MEANTA HIT YA
[00:58:49] <iszak> coldhead, no seriously, I'm leaving the country in 2 weeks :(
[00:58:52] <coldhead> I JUST GET SO FRUSTRATED
[00:58:56] <coldhead> where you off too?!
[00:59:01] <coldhead> to*
[00:59:02] <iszak> The UK
[00:59:08] <coldhead> yay!
[00:59:22] <coldhead> whereabouts?
[00:59:25] <iszak> gonna be fun
[00:59:26] <coldhead> wales and northern ireland?
[00:59:33] <coldhead> :D
[00:59:35] <iszak> neither
[00:59:48] <coldhead> so you're going to england
[00:59:57] <coldhead> or possibly the isle of mann
[01:00:12] <abefromann> hi folks - got a jquery.when() question for you
[01:00:18] <iszak> coldhead, Just England
[01:00:36] <coldhead> what you got, sausage king of chicago
[01:00:51] <abefromann> i've got an example working where im passing in 2 deferreds as arguments
[01:01:08] <abefromann> but i want to pass an array of deferreds
[01:01:34] <abefromann> or rather an unknown number of deferreds
[01:01:40] <abefromann> is that possible?
[01:02:17] <coldhead> i have a feeling that's possible, abefromann
[01:02:21] <coldhead> it's ringing a bell
[01:03:06] <abefromann> im getting different results when calling when(dfd1,dfd2) compared to when([dfd1,dfd2])
[01:03:39] <coldhead> abefromann: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5627284/pass-in-an-array-of-deferreds-to-when
[01:04:28] <ray73864> so anyone know how i can do what i need?
[01:05:59] <abefromann> nice one coldhead - who'd have thought that answer would be there on the internet - bah
[01:10:57] <coldhead> ?nth-child @ ray73864
[01:10:58] <bot-t1> ray73864, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[01:12:03] <ray73864> i was thinking that originally, but it is all in one table
[01:12:26] <AnthonyCat> Hello. What's a good file upload plugin? (ajax with PHP)
[01:12:28] <coldhead> use the equation
[01:12:35] <coldhead> you just need to think of a tricky eqn
[01:12:41] <ray73864> so <tr> 1, 2 and 3 should all be called 'group 1', 4, 5 and 6 should be 'group 2', etc... and then the striping should happen on the group itself
[01:12:53] <coldhead> ?g blueimp github jquery file upload @ AnthonyCat
[01:12:54] <bot-t1> AnthonyCat, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[01:13:04] <AnthonyCat> Thanks coldhead :)
[01:13:20] <ray73864> filter() looks like it could work though, as i have an attribute on the <tr> called 'rowid' and each of the 3 have the same rowid as each other, etc...
[01:13:24] <toxz> is thix working? element.parents('tr:first th:first')
[01:13:33] <ray73864> say eg: <tr rowid='1'></tr>
[01:13:51] <ray73864> this is my actual table example: http://jsfiddle.net/trqWv/
[01:18:14] <ray73864> ok, ended up with: $(".row").filter(function(index) { return $(this).attr("rowid") % 2 == 0; }).css('background-color', 'LightGrey');
[01:19:19] <coldhead> thats better than what i was trying, good job ray73864
[01:19:57] <ray73864> yeah, i only ended up finding it because i was looking through the definition for :odd (i think it was)
[01:21:23] <ray73864> and it works, awesome
[01:21:51] <markj> use addClass instead of css and its sorted
[01:21:56] <ray73864> thanks everyone, would have had to of done a backend function up to work out the striping had it not worked
[01:22:44] <ray73864> yeah, will eventually do the addClass with it, that's the last thing to do, gotta actually get the report up and fully running first and make sure the data is all valid
[01:23:09] <aaronmcadam> mornin lads
[01:23:22] <ray73864> afternoon
[01:23:30] <ray73864> almost evenin' :)
[01:23:41] <aaronmcadam> haha aussie?
[01:23:49] <ray73864> yeah, west-aussie
[01:23:57] <ray73864> lower south-west west-aussie
[01:23:58] <aaronmcadam> sound dude i'm irish
[01:24:12] <aaronmcadam> workin in england
[01:24:14] <coldhead> MUSIC FROM PERTH REPRESENT!
[01:24:24] <ray73864> haha
[01:24:34] <coldhead> ray73864: http://jsfiddle.net/62tjj/
[01:24:48] <coldhead> not sure how that works and i have a mathematics degree
[01:25:08] <ray73864> haha
[01:25:11] <ray73864> i suck at math
[01:25:29] <aaronmcadam> isn't there another pseudo selector for stuff like that
[01:25:31] <ray73864> looks better than my solution though, which was to rely on an attribute on the row itself
[01:25:45] <aaronmcadam> but jquery doesn't support it yet without qsa i think
[01:25:59] <ray73864> there is :odd and :even, aaron, but i needed groups of 3 for the striping
[01:26:07] <coldhead> hard to know which is faster
[01:26:33] <aaronmcadam> oh no i'm talkin about nth selectors
[01:26:34] <ray73864> speed isn't an issue, it's a special sales report for a point of sale system
[01:27:00] <aaronmcadam> as in stepping
[01:27:24] <aaronmcadam> why 6n though?
[01:28:04] <ray73864> i'm not even sure what 6n is actually doing
[01:28:15] <coldhead> because you don't really want groups of 3, you want groups of 6
[01:28:19] <aaronmcadam> 6(1), 6(2), ...
[01:28:23] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[01:28:27] <coldhead> and in those groups of six, you want the first 3 of each group
[01:28:31] <aaronmcadam> ah!
[01:28:34] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:28:38] <ray73864> oh?
[01:28:43] <aaronmcadam> induction is crazy though
[01:28:43] <coldhead> so i get to keep my maths degree?
[01:28:55] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:29:02] <ray73864> so long as i get to keep my CS degree :)
[01:29:08] <aaronmcadam> and me shite my comp science degree
[01:29:35] <orl> Hi!
[01:29:45] <aaronmcadam> coldhead, I think there is an nth selector in the spec for stuff like getting blocks
[01:29:52] <ray73864> i'm liking 1.6 too, especially the new .prop() function
[01:29:58] <orl> Always on that History.js thing (I persist)
[01:30:01] <aaronmcadam> ?nth-last-child
[01:30:05] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam, jQuery :nth-last-child selector | jQuery Plugins - Works exactly like jQuerys built-in :nth-child selector , except that it counts from the end. Supports any index/even/odd/equation that :nth-child does. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-nth-last-child-plugin
[01:30:13] <coldhead> i thought so too, aaronmcadam but i couldn't find one that works
[01:30:15] <ray73864> even better was that the jQuery Keys plugin i am using which was designed for 1.4.2 works 100% in 1.6
[01:30:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah support in jquery probably isn't there yet
[01:30:40] <aaronmcadam> well, sizzle i mean
[01:31:23] <aaronmcadam> haha bit funny that you persist with a persistence layer orl :P
[01:31:34] <orl> just to recall: here is basically how my jQuery menu works: http://pastebin.com/mQgeWHuT
[01:31:38] <aaronmcadam> you got nowhere?
[01:31:51] <orl> I didin't find what didn't work
[01:32:02] <toxz> this selection gives me the tr not th... any ideas? 'tr:first th'
[01:32:02] <orl> Actually, the probably is not that much $.ajax() or $.load()
[01:32:08] <aaronmcadam> what happens if in your bind
[01:32:19] <Murugaratham> how normal is it for me to do a setInterval($.each($.getJSON(...)), 50) if there are like 50 nested ajax calls
[01:32:21] <aaronmcadam> you console.log the event object
[01:32:22] <orl> (and I'm way far from understanding sufficiently that $.ajax() thing to make things better than with $.load()=
[01:32:22] <ray73864> oh fudge, good thing i can look through these filter ideas, just remembers i need rows in groups of 5 not 3 :(
[01:32:37] <orl> aaronmcadam: yeah, just to check what it gives
[01:32:48] <aaronmcadam> orl it could be anything though
[01:33:24] <aaronmcadam> have you checked your server side?
[01:33:26] <orl> you want me to log the event object, right?
[01:33:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm yeah but it might not be that useful
[01:33:50] <orl> arronmcadam: this might be the problem, indeed, cause my apache is crappy (or worst)...
[01:34:00] <aaronmcadam> I've got a feeling the problem might not be what you think
[01:34:11] <aaronmcadam> it's easy to get bogged down, done it before
[01:34:22] <aaronmcadam> are you returning json to parse? or just html?
[01:34:26] <orl> but actually, I'm working on a CMS (spip), and am a bit lazy about puttin all online just to check that thing (got a poor Adsl)
[01:34:50] <orl> aaronmcadam: I'm sure the problem is not what I feel! :)
[01:34:56] <aaronmcadam> why do u need the plugin?
[01:35:15] <aaronmcadam> are you using loads of ajax?
[01:35:19] <aaronmcadam> can it work without it?
[01:35:29] <aaronmcadam> your app
[01:35:30] <orl> I made a jQuery menu with animation things. But as I care about accesibility, openweb, w3C, and so on, I just want to make it work with back, next, and url bar
[01:35:36] <aaronmcadam> does it work without ajax/js?
[01:35:50] <orl> it works without, I have raw links
[01:36:14] <aaronmcadam> so you're not going to actual pages? just hash-linking
[01:36:33] <orl> sorry, didn't understand taht sentence (english too bad)
[01:36:53] <aaronmcadam> you are not going to a link like this: '/about/'
[01:36:58] <orl> OK, if you mean I don't load the whole page, no I do not, I just load #mainDiv content
[01:37:01] <aaronmcadam> but instead '#about' ?
[01:37:13] <aaronmcadam> why?
[01:37:18] <orl> I might better pastebin you some snippets of my code?
[01:37:37] <aaronmcadam> it's ok I'm lookin for a more of an overview
[01:37:49] <aaronmcadam> why are you using ajax?
[01:38:01] <orl> because someone told me to! ;)
[01:38:14] <orl> OK, I'm going to pastebin some lines
[01:38:15] <aaronmcadam> as i feared just cuz it looks cool right :p
[01:42:05] <orl> aaronmcadam: here is the html part: http://pastebin.com/GGzKKKwn
[01:42:23] <orl> (might be some errors in the "build by spip part", as it's not copy/paste)
[01:42:43] <orl> and here is the js part (be ready, you can fear now!): http://pastebin.com/3wsWUyQb
[01:43:15] <orl> I've made some attempts in the History.Adapter.bind thing, so if you want/need to know them, just ask

[01:56:48] <dirkpennings> anyone familiar with jqmobile + phonegap? when I build an app through xcode and deploy it to my iPad, the transitions aren't smooth and the destination page (with an image) appears as blocks rendering.. When using safari and my webpage (same code) it's a lot smoother.. anyone got an idea?
[01:56:56] <Lee_msi> basically i see in some widgets. Some elements that are created are assigned a variable like "var x= $()". others use "this.something = $()". Do i need to use "this.something=" if i later want to manipulate the element in the widget options method

[01:57:59] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[01:58:07] <aaronmcadam> #jquerymobile dirkpennings
[01:58:20] <orl> Actually, I feel I didn't understand what that History.Adapter.bin thing was aimed to. I've understood it's fired by statechange which is fired by any new load (link, back, next, url bar, and so on). And I feel I'm suppose to write something in it so that it changes the content in the good way. I though that, basically, loading the new content after getStat() (so that I get the new url) was the way.
[01:58:20] <aaronmcadam> what version are you using?
[01:59:30] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[01:59:38] <aaronmcadam> doesn't sound good
[01:59:48] <aaronmcadam> if you don't understand how to use it
[01:59:53] <aaronmcadam> why not use bbq?
[02:00:28] <aaronmcadam> it's simpler
[02:00:38] <orl> it's simpler, but it doesn't fit exactly the same needs
[02:00:46] <orl> it just does hash, and no html5
[02:01:01] <aaronmcadam> why do you need pushState?
[02:01:18] <aaronmcadam> ah you've got full urls
[02:01:20] <orl> because of that ajax navigation
[02:01:35] <aaronmcadam> does it really add much to the ux?
[02:01:40] <aaronmcadam> doesn't make sense to me
[02:01:56] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with a proper page reload?
[02:02:36] <aaronmcadam> plus the plugin's creator is in the chat here
[02:02:55] <aaronmcadam> but I think you should question whether you should be using ajax
[02:03:04] <orl> aaronmcadam: plugin creator, do you mean history
[02:03:06] <aaronmcadam> too many people just use it just because
[02:03:09] <aaronmcadam> no, bbq
[02:03:21] <orl> actually, there's two points for that: decreasing the load, data transfer and so on, second: having this animated menu terminating its animation while page load
[02:03:35] <dirkpennings> aaronmcadam: yeah I know, but no activity there.. :)
[02:03:36] <aaronmcadam> data transfer? media will be cached
[02:03:42] <aaronmcadam> i know dirkpennings
[02:03:47] <aaronmcadam> it picks up a little bit
[02:03:49] <orl> probably, yeah
[02:04:12] <aaronmcadam> decreasing the load haha
[02:04:48] <orl> actually: the page doesn't have to be load several times, on my machines (with XDMCP and a network we could speak about) it does matte
[02:04:51] <aaronmcadam> i dunno i think you're just complicating it
[02:04:54] <orl> s/matte/matter
[02:05:19] <orl> aaronmcadam: this is compeltely possible, as my knowledges in this is poor, and I just go the way people told me to go!
[02:05:36] <aaronmcadam> well you're obviously going round in circles with it
[02:05:47] <aaronmcadam> just remove the ajax for navigation
[02:06:01] <orl> what should I use then, just a single page load?
[02:06:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:06:09] <aaronmcadam> you can always come back to it
[02:06:38] <orl> actually, the website is already OK with raw links (or standard page load)
[02:06:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:06:55] <orl> and actually, it's already OK with AJAX if I don't care about history (but I do)
[02:06:56] <aaronmcadam> you're not going to add anything to the ux by using ajax
[02:07:10] <orl> what do you call ux?
[02:07:14] <aaronmcadam> you care about history but not seo?
[02:07:17] <orl> user experience?
[02:07:20] <aaronmcadam> yep
[02:07:28] <orl> what do you call seo? (lol)
[02:07:37] <aaronmcadam> ?g SEO @ orl
[02:07:38] <bot-t1> orl, Search engine optimization - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization
[02:08:07] <orl> yeah, that point is true too
[02:08:17] <Samoneill> Is there also a way to parse a date with "parseDate" like the way this function does "$(this).datepicker('setDate', new Date());"
[02:08:18] <orl> but I don't care that much about it
[02:08:25] <Samoneill> and if yes... how?
[02:08:59] <orl> still: the website navigation without js is available, so I suppose the SEO might work a bit at least
[02:09:36] <albacker> $(this).parents('li').siblings('li').each(function() {   will i go through $(this) in this case?
[02:09:36] <aaronmcadam> kk
[02:09:57] <orl> aaronmcadam: it's all about managing to make it works will make me happy and proud!
[02:09:59] <aaronmcadam> orl you should concentrate on the rest
[02:10:00] <orl> ;)
[02:10:10] <jomofcw> Hello !
[02:10:17] <aaronmcadam> eh albacker?
[02:10:58] <orl> aaronmcadam: but the rest is OK, the CMS works perfectly, and it's alright. That's just the next step, ad I'd like to pass it!
[02:11:16] <aaronmcadam> i think you should drop the idea really
[02:11:37] <orl> with no alternative, it's a not a really fun option!
[02:12:02] <aaronmcadam> the alternative is working on something you don't quite understand for little end gain
[02:12:08] <aaronmcadam> it's your time i spose lol
[02:12:16] <orl> hehe, that's it
[02:12:32] <orl> when I'll have understood it a bit more, I would not have lose that time!
[02:12:33] <aaronmcadam> and it's bound to be pretty brittle
[02:12:53] <albacker> aaronmcadam, ?
[02:13:05] <aaronmcadam> albacker, what are you asking?
[02:13:14] <aaronmcadam> how to get at the element in the each?
[02:13:18] <albacker> no
[02:13:35] <aaronmcadam> explain then dude
[02:14:30] <albacker> when i do $(this).siblings('li).each(..  do i go through $(this) too or just the siblings without the current one?
[02:15:20] <aaronmcadam> ah
[02:15:27] <aaronmcadam> just the siblings
[02:16:05] <albacker> thanks aaronmcadam :)
[02:16:12] <aaronmcadam> no prob dude
[02:28:22] <Lee_msi> if im creating a widget with buttons. Would it be best to hardcode image url's for the buttons, or should i use an anchor with a background css ?
[02:28:31] <Lee_msi> whats the best way to do it in regards to portability e.c.t.
[02:30:37] <juria_roberts> please suggest the easiest color picker to use with minimum coding?

[02:31:44] <bot-t1> http://qikr.co/files/pics/c/cavvljpg40802.jpg
[02:31:55] <juria_roberts> well its got to be jquery
[02:32:12] <skamikaze> juria_roberts: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137750/ColorPicker
[02:33:19] <juria_roberts> if anyone has implememnted color picker in jsfiddle i wud like to see it
[02:36:25] <emil-malmoe> is there any editor for os x that gives hints and autocompletes jQuery? i'm on coda right now, but the experience is not as good as when writing html or php in it.
[02:40:23] <jayflux> no editor autocompletes jQuery natively as jQuery is a library/framework not a language
[02:40:41] <jayflux> you would need a plugin for that I think
[02:41:32] <jayflux> textmate maybe easier for you emil-malmoe
[02:42:29] <emil-malmoe> yes, but as it's so popular, i guess there's a need for something that speeds up development :)
[02:42:36] <aaronmcadam> jayflux, you're wrong
[02:42:51] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[02:43:01] <aaronmcadam> pycharm picks up whatever libraries you've included on the page
[02:43:11] <aaronmcadam> and your own external js files too
[02:43:40] <aaronmcadam> pycharm is for django/python dev though
[02:44:12] <emil-malmoe> sounds pretty awesome
[02:44:39] <emil-malmoe> i'll do some googling
[02:44:41] <MoTiOnXml> can you get parents() until a certain criteria?
[02:44:41] <jayflux> yeah not really the sort of editor i had in mind when he asked that question
[02:44:54] <aaronmcadam> aye
[02:45:02] <MoTiOnXml> like "all parents until you find an element with a 'data-jsonID' attribute"=
[02:45:02] <orl> aaronmcadam: hey, I think I got it
[02:45:04] <aaronmcadam> it's an IDE anyways
[02:45:20] <jayflux> MoTiOnXml:  .parentsUntil()
[02:45:20] <orl> aaronmcadam: what I was doing was OK, even in History.Adapter.bind
[02:45:29] <MoTiOnXml> jayflux: lol :)
[02:45:30] <aaronmcadam> ?parentsUntil
[02:45:30] <bot-t1> .parentsUntil([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[02:45:44] <orl> aaronmcadam: but there must be a css rule that tricks me somewhere, and thus I don't get the content displayed.
[02:47:09] <aaronmcadam> i dunno
[02:51:20] <toberger> hey guys, I got a litte problem with a JavaScript function using jQuery: http://pastebin.com/6s3nNngz
[02:52:41] <toberger> When I run this method the first time it runs as expected, but when I run it twice the click function is called 2 times
[02:53:04] <toberger> after the third run it is called 3 times and so on
[02:53:45] <orl> aaronmcadam: I just disable the History.log, so that the console display the GET things (things != repository for that time), and I could verify that the content was correctly loaded. Just a css rule that made it disappear somewhere!
[02:53:49] <orl> Right
[02:53:58] <albacker> how do i get the nth parent?
[02:54:02] <toberger> how can i prevent adding this click event multiple times?
[02:55:59] <skamikaze> toberger: assign live once, just run the ajax part inside the function
[02:56:49] <toberger> skamikaze: I don't understand. What do you mean with, run the ajax part inside the function?
[02:57:13] <skamikaze> ?parents @ albacker
[02:57:14] <bot-t1> albacker, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[02:57:18] <skamikaze> ?:eq @ albacker
[02:57:19] <bot-t1> albacker, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[02:58:00] <albacker> thanks skamikaze :)
[02:58:20] <skamikaze> toberger: onready do $('.el').live( 'click', handler ); handler = function () { $.ajax({
[03:01:02] <toberger> skamikaze: mmh, still the same problem
[03:03:45] <Famic> anyone would know how to detect if jquerymobile is loaded or not ?
[03:04:13] <orl> aaronmcadam: OK, I think I found my way into this. Actually I thought that pushState just change the url bar and the history, but it actually also trigs an changestate events, so the content load should appear only in that History.Adapter.bind
[03:04:49] <skamikaze> Famic: if( ! $.mobile ) { // fallback
[03:05:20] <Famic> skamikaze: thanks
[03:06:15] <skamikaze> toberger: change your code as described or use a singleton to assign the live handler
[03:06:52] <edbaffei> how do i make function2 wait until function1 is done ? http://dpaste.com/561245/
[03:08:35] <skamikaze> edbaffei: call fn2 at the end of fn1 or use deferreds and $.when / then / fail
[03:08:47] <toberger> skamikaze: thx for help, works right now
[03:08:59] <albacker> skamikaze, can i combine :not and :eq ?
[03:09:07] <albacker> i want to get everything except the first child for example.
[03:09:21] <albacker> $(this).children('li:not:eq(0)') ?
[03:09:53] <skamikaze> albacker: $(this).children('li').not(':first').first()
[03:10:24] <skamikaze> or use .eq
[03:10:30] <VictorCL2> fin("div[class~=tab-footer]")  ... doestn seem to work on ie7 .. is it correct?
[03:10:31] <edbaffei> skamikaze: ok.. thnks
[03:10:42] <VictorCL2> find("div[class~=tab-footer]")
[03:11:09] <albacker> $(this).children('li').not(':eq(0)') < skamikaze  ?
[03:11:51] <skamikaze> albacker: try it out :P
[03:12:17] <albacker> im trying it out but it's not working like it should
[03:13:34] <skamikaze> albacker: you can use slice here e.g. : $(this).children('li').slice(1)
[03:14:26] <alexKour> Hello
[03:15:38] <alexKour> Any chances som1 can review this code and tell me why it runs on fiddle but not localy on a template i have created for joomla 1.5?(Note that the "a" will be switched to a dynamic menus link (".menu li") http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/12/
[03:18:04] <solidus-river> hey all, how does jquery get instantiated
[03:18:34] <solidus-river> i inherteted a bunch of jequery code, and they have a lot of classes inside .js, but i cant for the life of me find where thier included or loaded in the actual html files
[03:19:12] <jayflux> alexKour: joomla runs mootools so set yout jquery to noConflict() before you use it
[03:19:24] <jayflux> otherwise the $ shortcut won't work
[03:20:16] <skamikaze> solidus-river: http://jsfiddle.net/rudygotya/kmyj5/2/
[03:20:21] <alexKour> Till now all worked great without using noConflict()
[03:20:29] <skamikaze> solidus-river: that's the basic pattern of jquery core
[03:20:35] <alexKour> I m goin to recheck it ,thanks for the advice
[03:21:49] <solidus-river> skamikaze: so where would the previouse coder have referenced that, wouldn't he or she have to include that code in the html file to have it work
[03:22:17] <skamikaze> ?? don't get your question
[03:22:43] <solidus-river> skamikaze: does jQuery auto probe the /js directory for classes that it can use or does it have to be included
[03:23:08] <solidus-river> skamikaze: they include jquery in the page, and there are a bunch of jquery classes they made, but i fail to see the connection between them and the page i'm viewing in my browser
[03:23:09] <skamikaze> talking bout the git repo?
[03:23:29] <solidus-river> skamikaze: ?
[03:24:10] <skamikaze> what exactly are you talking about? :)
[03:24:25] <wangdoo> Hi..guys
[03:24:52] <skamikaze> solidus-river: about pages in general? about jquery development
[03:24:53] <skamikaze> ?
[03:25:35] <wangdoo> I have toe select box.when i select value from first select box and i do n't change value from second drop box.i should be able to send this through $ajax.how do i do it?
[03:26:25] <skamikaze> solidus-river: "but i cant for the life of me find where thier included or loaded in the actual html files" what do you mean here
[03:26:49] <wangdoo> skamikaze: check this link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6532359/drop-down-box-using-jquery
[03:26:57] <solidus-river> skamikaze: i inhereted a web development project that uses jquery for ajax requests to a restful api. The previouse coder has written some jQuery classes and they are all in a foldier. The page that supposedly uses them includes jQuery, however i fail to see where it instantiates those classes that the previouse coder has written. I was wondering if jQuery does any automagik searching for jquery classes
[03:27:04] <JenniferB2> hi folks... i have an unespaced multiline body in a file that I need to pass to jQuery.. what do I need to do to make it work...
[03:27:46] <skamikaze> solidus-river: no it doesn't
[03:28:12] <clockwize> hey, i want my jquery app to change the url with a # at the end and some paramters so you can send the url around and have it show in the same state, even though it's all on one page. is there a plugin that will aid me in this?
[03:28:34] <codecab> jquery app? :>
[03:28:48] <skamikaze> ?bbq @ clockwize
[03:28:49] <bot-t1> clockwize, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event.

[03:29:08] <clockwize> awesome, thanks
[03:29:24] <solidus-river> skamikaze: :) the more i look at these peoples code base the more i understand just how much trouble their in
[03:29:26] <nyholt> If anyone with some basic math/logic skills wants to advise this rookie, have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6533377/how-can-i-remember-combination-states
[03:29:54] <smali> hey what is a simple jqeuery gallery plugin that any of you can recommend
[03:30:02] <skamikaze> solidus-river: :P
[03:30:59] <iopm> hello, is there an animated jquery tagcloud plugin?
[03:33:42] <krz> the slide effect has a funny way of sliding down
[03:34:32] <krz> at http://www.last.fm/events how can the same effect be achieved when you click on "Jump to another location"
[03:35:20] <solidus-river> skamikaze: holy crap they put the javascript at the bottom of the page, is there any possible reason for this or can i move it to the top of the page like a normal person
[03:35:56] <solidus-river> they put it all at the end of the body
[03:36:01] <solidus-river> why is this?
[03:36:24] <markj> thats best practice
[03:36:28] <hariom> Hi, I have two buttons, one is disabled using .attr('disabled', 'disabled') and another is not disabled. I have catching the click on event on these buttons based on the css class they share i.e. $("input.new-buttons").click(... ); I want to know how can I stop firing click event on a disabled element?
[03:36:42] <krz> anyone?
[03:36:49] <solidus-river> markj: why is it best practice?
[03:36:57] <primepie> if I have <span> <img>  <img> <img> <img class="selected" </span> .. how can I know how many siblbings are before .selected
[03:37:10] <markj> solidus-river http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/07/high_performanc_5/
[03:38:17] <sharat87> hariom: use $("input.new-buttons").not(':disabled').click(... ); see http://api.jquery.com/disabled-selector/
[03:38:57] <hariom> sharat87: oh i see, I never knew that there is ".not(...)" as well.
[03:39:02] <hariom> trying it out
[03:41:08] <hariom> sharat87: Function inside the click(...) still gets executed for the 'disabled' items.
[03:42:21] <hariom> This works for all the buttons irrespective of enabled or disabled      $("input.new-buttons").not(":disabled").click(function() { alert($(this).attr('disabled')) }
[03:42:26] <hariom> sharat87:
[03:43:13] <solidus-river> markj: thats good to know, is there also a reason that they would put all my things in a /desktop/ foldier?
[03:44:08] <markj> no idea about that, probably just how they do things
[03:44:48] <sharat87> hariom: is the button disabled after you are running this piece of code? That would explain the problem
[03:45:31] <sharat87> If you want to check if the element is disabled in the click handler, put in a if(!$(this).is(':disabled)) { /* stuff for enabled elements */ }
[03:46:19] <solidus-river> markj: th ank you, the world makes sense again :), now i can dig into this jquery stuff they have a bit
[03:47:07] <nyholt> adding fiddle to my question at S.O.: http://jsfiddle.net/gnijholt/58zuR/ (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6533377/how-can-i-remember-combination-states)
[03:48:29] <hariom> sharat87: that make sense.
[03:49:25] <hariom> I guess I will need to use live to register events instead of registering at document ready because the buttons are getting disabled bit later on.
[03:49:39] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ hariom

[03:50:13] <hariom> aaronmcadam: thanks.
[03:50:24] <sharat87> hariom: I'd personally not do that. I discourage using live if you can help, but that's personal :)
[03:50:32] <sharat87> yeah, delegate is awesome though
[03:50:49] <doncams> hey. I'm creating a 'lightbox'-like effect. when I click on an element, I am appending a <div> to <body> and have it z-index: 1000; or something. my problem is how to make it have a dynamic width/height same as the viewport

[03:52:47] <sharat87> doncams: why don't you use a plugin for that? like jquery tools' overlay, which is awesome btw
[03:52:50] <doncams> this is my code http://pastebin.com/feNzt7xn

[03:55:12] <aaronmcadam> wait

[03:55:59] <dhruvasagar> Hi, I am trying to use jquery-ui tabs, but when I call .tabs() method, I get an error Uncaught TypeError: Object 1309431242463 has no method 'sort'

[03:56:14] <aaronmcadam> doncams, http://pastebin.com/A9v45uBj
[03:56:41] <laerti> ok let me integrate it
[03:57:02] <aaronmcadam> dhruvasagar, looks like jq ui isn't being included
[03:57:45] <aaronmcadam> clockwize, use the callbacks fancybox provides
[03:57:56] <aaronmcadam> ?g fancybox api
[03:57:57] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam, Fancybox - Fancy lightbox alternative| API & Options - http://fancybox.net/api

[03:58:09] <aaronmcadam> ?g fancybox api @ clockwize
[03:58:09] <solidus-river> thanks all for helping me get to know jquery, i'll probably be back tomorrow :)

[03:58:13] <solidus-river> 'night all
[03:58:24] <aaronmcadam> just bind a click event to it then
[03:58:30] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: no, it is, if it wasn't in that case it would give error no method 'tabs'
[03:58:49] <doncams> thanks
[03:58:55] <clockwize> aaronmcadam: sounds a tad hacky.
[03:59:00] <aaronmcadam> are u sure you've included the sortable part of the library when u downloaded it?
[03:59:07] <aaronmcadam> clockwize, no it doesn't
[03:59:19] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: I included everything, but i'll check again
[03:59:23] <aaronmcadam> just bind an event to the fancybox wrapper
[03:59:29] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: yes I have
[03:59:43] <aaronmcadam> i dunno I've not looked at your page
[03:59:54] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: me ?
[03:59:58] <doncams> aaronmcadam, found something simpler
[03:59:59] <doncams> position: fixed; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; overflow: hidden;
[04:00:05] <doncams> thanks though

[04:00:16] <aaronmcadam> k
[04:00:34] <aaronmcadam> don't chain loads of css() calls together doncams
[04:00:42] <clockwize> aaronmcadam: fancybox wrapper?
[04:00:53] <aaronmcadam> yea
[04:01:14] <aaronmcadam> why don't you just bind to the link
[04:01:20] <aaronmcadam> that opens fb
[04:01:33] <aaronmcadam> is that what u want
[04:01:44] <aaronmcadam> to do something with the link that opens fancybox
[04:01:51] <clockwize> well, i'd like onStart to give me the link that was clicked, i might edit fancybox :p
[04:02:06] <sharat87> laerti: That page throws this error "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'jFlow'"  <-- may be you're missing this jFlow thing?
[04:02:17] <laerti> hmmm
[04:02:22] <aaronmcadam> a simple click event would work
[04:02:26] <laerti> sharat87: let me see
[04:02:35] <aaronmcadam> don't see why you want it in the onStart
[04:02:46] <aaronmcadam> though i don't know what you're tryin to do
[04:02:54] <clockwize> because it's the correct place for it
[04:03:20] <clockwize> i want to know when any fancybox is shown and where it came from, i don't want to bind to 20 odd links all over the site to do this
[04:03:20] <laerti> sharat87: i have it  slider/jquery.flow.1.2.js
[04:04:02] <Raydiation> will jquery integrate css animations?
[04:04:03] <aaronmcadam> ah fuck it then haha
[04:04:14] <laerti> sharat87:  and here  http://rreth.com/testela5/slider/     works ok
[04:04:19] <aaronmcadam> there's a project trying to do that Raydiation
[04:04:34] <VictorCL2> if there is not explicit set width.   .width() will calculate the width automatically?
[04:04:39] <Raydiation> aaronmcadam: ty
[04:04:44] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[04:04:48] <aaronmcadam> there's one on github
[04:05:16] <sharat87> laerti: yeah, but may be you are calling that jFlow method *before* the jquery.flow.js file loads, hence that method is still undefined
[04:05:34] <aaronmcadam> Raydiation, http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[04:05:37] <sharat87> laerti: make sure you call the jFlow method *after* that plugin js file is loaded
[04:05:46] <Raydiation> aaronmcadam: ty :)
[04:06:08] <laerti> can i give u my index.php  so u can take a look?
[04:06:15] <Raydiation> i suppose this is faster than doing it with js
[04:06:22] <aaronmcadam> course
[04:06:32] <aaronmcadam> with js as a fallback
[04:07:15] <aaronmcadam> look identical on ff5 Raydiation
[04:08:11] <laerti> sharat87:  can i give you my index.php so can take a look?
[04:08:26] <aaronmcadam> laerti just make sure the script is included
[04:08:32] <aaronmcadam> before you write your code
[04:08:41] <laerti> aaronmcadam it is included
[04:08:45] <sharat87> put the html that is responsible for loading the js files in a pastebin like paste.pocoo.org
[04:09:00] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ laerti
[04:09:01] <bot-t1> laerti, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:09:14] <sharat87> ah right ^
[04:09:26] <laerti> http://pastebin.com/rv6B7nAE
[04:09:30] <laerti> i have pasted it here
[04:09:37] <aaronmcadam> it's the standard one we use sharat87 is all
[04:10:12] <solidus-river> if i wanted to include jquery code from other files in one main file, whats the best syntax to do this
[04:10:30] <aaronmcadam> laerti you need to organise your includes better
[04:10:31] <laerti> sharat87: i maded the gaps  <!--slider start--> code  <!--slider end-->
[04:10:33] <sharat87> aaronmcadam: yeah, I never remember how to use the bots :)
[04:11:09] <WoShiNiBaBa> 哎！好不容易才找到这儿，诸位大虾辛苦了.......
[04:11:16] <aaronmcadam> that sucks
[04:11:40] <aaronmcadam> you're also including 2 different versions of jquery laerti
[04:11:49] <laerti> yeah i think
[04:12:04] <laerti> cuffon and the site big slideshow
[04:12:27] <aaronmcadam> you need to reorganise
[04:12:34] <WoShiNiBaBa> What do you mean
[04:12:34] <aaronmcadam> include all scripts first
[04:12:36] <aaronmcadam> and then your code
[04:12:50] <laerti> hmmm
[04:13:31] <aaronmcadam> it's all over the place laerti
[04:13:45] <aaronmcadam> you've got code that triggers and then more scripts being included afterwards
[04:14:04] <laerti> can u do smth on that, im new, i have 1 week with this problem
[04:14:14] <aaronmcadam> plus you're including like 8 or 9 bloody scripts
[04:14:20] <aaronmcadam> no
[04:14:33] <aaronmcadam> include css first
[04:14:41] <laerti> yeah than
[04:14:41] <solidus-river> if i have a bunch of $.widget defines in seperate js files and i want to unify them into one include for my page, how would i include them in that main include
[04:14:43] <aaronmcadam> then your scripts starting with jquery
[04:14:57] <laerti> ok  in the <head></head>
[04:15:01] <aaronmcadam> ye
[04:15:28] <aaronmcadam> shite you're using the pngfix.htc too your page must be sloooow
[04:15:38] <laerti> :(
[04:15:40] <aaronmcadam> you are aware of how slow that hack is right
[04:15:48] <laerti> nope
[04:15:49] <laerti> ;(
[04:15:50] <laerti> :(
[04:15:56] <aaronmcadam> every page gets repainted by ie
[04:16:14] <aaronmcadam> whether the image is a png or not it redraws everything
[04:19:05] <solidus-river> is .include default jquery?
[04:19:16] <aaronmcadam> ?include
[04:19:20] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam, include | jQuery Plugins - This jQuery plugin provides browser based file include similar to SSI. The main use is for html prototyping where the files are going to be viewed in a file system rather than hosted. If you are lo... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/include
[04:19:42] <aaronmcadam> nope solidus-river
[04:19:54] <alexKour> Hello,if i replace all "$" symbols inside my jquery lib with "$j" is this a valid way to run in no conflict?Or should i use noConflict()?
[04:19:57] <aaronmcadam> there was a bit of talk about it a while ago
[04:20:06] <aaronmcadam> lol
[04:20:35] <aaronmcadam> should i implement something myself or use a method
[04:20:36] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:21:09] <aaronmcadam> don't edit the jquery source!
[04:21:13] <ravionrails> i am looking for multiselect with checkbox and autocomplete/searching also be there
[04:21:24] <alexKour> So i ll just use noConflict()!
[04:21:25] <aaronmcadam> why are you renaming the dollar sumbols
[04:21:30] <aaronmcadam> symbols*
[04:21:34] <sharat87> alexKour: yes, if you do $j = jQuery.noConflict()
[04:21:47] <alexKour> to prevent a conflict between jq and mootools
[04:22:09] <alexKour> I was just wondering for the right way,i dont really need it now
[04:22:21] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: thanks :)
[04:22:27] <aaronmcadam> np
[04:23:07] <aaronmcadam> laerti, "
[04:23:07] <aaronmcadam> After more searching and testing it turns out that an .htc file was the issue (iepngfix.htc). This DRAMATICALLY slows performance and especially on pages with many controls such as a repeater.
[04:23:07] <aaronmcadam> Hope this helps someone else - went from 7 seconds to 0.3 seconds on complex page by removing."
[04:23:09] <m4rtijn> hi all
[04:23:47] <laerti> aaronmcadam: http://pastebin.com/xfugeWd5
[04:23:50] <WoShiNiBaBa> hi m4rtijn
[04:23:56] <m4rtijn> anyone fammiliar with UI dialog buttons? trying to set an ID for the buttons.. which isnt working at all
[04:23:58] <laerti> i think i organized the code
[04:24:09] <laerti> only like this it works, the slider no
[04:24:14] <aaronmcadam> you're including cufon twice
[04:24:29] <aaronmcadam> and u still have 2 versions of jquery!
[04:24:34] <laerti> only <h5></h5>
[04:24:48] <aaronmcadam> read it agai
[04:24:50] <alexKour> And 1 last question witch f**d up  my sleep time last 2 night. Why this http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/13/ works but when i replace the links "#" href with a real link it dont?
[04:24:54] <aaronmcadam> line 11 and line 16
[04:25:14] <aaronmcadam> line 9 and 21
[04:25:18] <m4rtijn> this is my code: http://www.pastie.org/2144337
[04:25:31] <m4rtijn> and the id: 'bla' is nto working
[04:25:31] <laerti> yeah  <h3> too
[04:25:43] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to include cufon twice
[04:25:57] <aaronmcadam> you're not using cufon properly
[04:26:03] <aaronmcadam> there's an api you know
[04:26:10] <aaronmcadam> read the docs
[04:26:39] <laerti> no i removed the <h3> cuffon
[04:26:46] <laerti> noe i have only 1
[04:27:03] <laerti> i had 2 different fonts  thats why i needed to include twice
[04:27:20] <WoShiNiBaBa> Clever little don't understand (complete) hd version
[04:27:36] <aaronmcadam> that's not  how you do it laerti!!!
[04:27:53] <aaronmcadam> read what i said
[04:28:06] <aaronmcadam> ?g cufon api @ laerti
[04:28:07] <bot-t1> laerti, API - GitHub - https://github.com/sorccu/cufon/wiki/API
[04:29:07] <laerti> ok man u think that cuffon conflicts with the slider
[04:29:08] <laerti> ?
[04:29:09] <aaronmcadam> alexKour, what real link
[04:29:35] <aaronmcadam> you're not returning false or using preventDefault() in your click handler alexKour
[04:29:40] <aaronmcadam> no
[04:29:51] <aaronmcadam> you're just using cufon wrong
[04:29:56] <aaronmcadam> and why are you still using 1.3.2
[04:30:10] <alexKour> http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/13/ this is a sample code.Works fine as long as <a href="#" .When i replace the "#" with ,lets say "http://www.google.com" it gets messed up
[04:30:13] <aaronmcadam> if it's for the slider, use a different slider
[04:30:35] <aaronmcadam> i just told you what to do alexKour
[04:30:37] <laerti> man this is my first site using cuffon and using all this js
[04:30:45] <aaronmcadam> i can tell :p
[04:31:52] <VictorCL2> would this be correct = if (!$.support.borderRadius && ($.browser.msie && $.browser.version !== "9.0")) {
[04:31:52] <aaronmcadam> alexKour, http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/14/
[04:31:55] * WoShiNiBaBa 抽出夺命鞭，当即挥舞起来,只见 #jquery 一片飞砂走石,看到众人眼花缭乱,这种景象入目,更搅得 ChanServ 心头疑念纷坛,莫明其妙。突然烟尘中击出一鞭,一声"咔嚓"裂响, ChanServ 脑瓜破开,死于非命.
[04:32:40] <codecab> WoShiNiBaBa: no
[04:32:52] <alexKour> If i returnfalse the part i want to appear will never reload with its proper content.Basically link and contentwrapper div get their values dynamic throught joomlas php.So if i return false i will never get contentwrapper get refreshed with its proper content. I was trying to setup a cookie witch will Make content stay visible until page exit or something no matter of page refreshes
[04:33:16] <aaronmcadam> what are you talking about
[04:33:35] <aaronmcadam> don't think you're getting how to use it then
[04:33:56] <aaronmcadam> in order to do something other than going to a different page with a link, you have to suppress its default functionality
[04:34:43] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax @ alexKour
[04:34:44] <bot-t1> alexKour, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:34:48] <aaronmcadam> you might have heard of it
[04:34:48] <laerti> aaronmcadam: can u solve my problem, i cant solve it.
[04:35:08] <laerti> aaronmcadam: its complicated
[04:35:10] <aaronmcadam> you're using an old slider then, just use a new one
[04:35:18] <laerti> cause i dont have the basics
[04:35:27] <aaronmcadam> sorry I can't write your code for you
[04:35:36] <laerti> i dont want that
[04:35:47] <laerti> the slider works out of the page
[04:35:51] <laerti> inside nope
[04:35:55] <Lee_msi> if i create a jq ui widget. and inside _create io bind an event like so "this.x.bind(click, this.method)" . within "this.method" how do i get and manipulate the data that was created and assigned to "this" within the create function
[04:35:57] <aaronmcadam> cuz it's such a mess probably
[04:36:19] <aaronmcadam> try using anything slider or something like that that's new
[04:36:52] <codecab> how can i convert an array of regular dom nodes to a set of jquery objects on which i can call a jquery method??
[04:37:10] <codecab> anyone knows a convinient way to do this?
[04:37:14] <laerti> aaronmcadam: i need originally that, because my client wants that
[04:37:41] <aaronmcadam> if it's running off old code who knows
[04:40:23] <alexKour> aaromcadam thanks! i ll take a loot @ ajax !
[04:40:51] <laerti> aaronmcadam: I CANNOT FIX IT :(
[04:41:29] <aaronmcadam> i've got work to do

[04:41:31] <aaronmcadam> sorry
[04:41:50] <laerti> ?
[04:42:22] <aaronmcadam> maybe you need to learn a bit more before you try this stuff for a client
[04:42:36] <m4rtijn> would anyone fammiliar with UI dialog be so kind to have a look here: http://www.pastie.org/2144337 -- why isnt the ID tag working?
[04:42:49] <iman> how can hidden a div when user click outside of the that element in jquery ?

[04:46:33] <laerti> didnt promised anything,  just he gave me that
[04:46:34] <aaronmcadam> i can't teach you the basics of how to include resources and then debug your code and then explain why loading 8 or 9 scripts into a page is bad, etc etc etc
[04:46:58] <laerti> i dont need that, i need only to fix this
[04:46:59] <laerti> nothing more
[04:47:08] <laerti> and i will not disturb you
[04:47:08] <aaronmcadam> that's the worst kind
[04:47:09] <laerti> anymore

[04:47:39] <laerti> all i have done i learned by my self
[04:47:49] <laerti> but now is smth that has to do with time
[04:47:59] <laerti> dont have time to learn
[04:48:02] <laerti> and then do it

[04:54:36] <laerti> ok
[04:58:17] <m4rtijn> would anyone fammiliar with UI dialog be so kind to have a look here: http://www.pastie.org/2144337 -- why isnt the ID tag working?
[04:58:19] <rns> anyone know why this wont set my cookies via ajax?  http://dpaste.com/560942/
[04:59:17] <Axcy> Anyone using the jQuery-Validation-Engine from Position absolute?
[04:59:47] <m4rtijn> Axcy: have you tired debugging with firebug?
[04:59:51] <m4rtijn> tried*
[05:03:16] <wangdoo> http://jsfiddle.net/8q4A8/ this is not working in my local host
[05:03:18] <Axcy> m4rtijn: Not having a problem as such, I'm just kind of debating of I should use that or just the default Jquery validation
[05:05:41] <m4rtijn> oh, i meant rns
[05:06:32] <rns> m4rtijn, yes it looks like the cookies are getting set via ajax, but then they are deleted
[05:07:40] <m4rtijn> ajax doesnt set any cookie imo..
[05:08:01] <m4rtijn> the cookie function does
[05:08:18] <wangdoo> m4rtijn:  http://jsfiddle.net/8q4A8/ this is not working in my local host
[05:08:56] <m4rtijn> wangdoo: i know, you said so before
[05:09:08] <m4rtijn> wangdoo: it seems to work fine in general though
[05:09:46] <wangdoo> m4rtijn: Can i do the same and pass through $ajax {} to other page.
[05:10:18] <wangdoo> m4rtijn: I want to pass toe select box values at a time through ajax{}.
[05:10:28] <rns> m4rtijn, yes, that's why this is odd.  It works perfectly with a full refresh, but not when I submit and return my form via ajax
[05:10:56] <ravionrails> i am looking for multiselect with checkbox and autocomplete/searching also be there to search from the dropdown list
[05:11:05] <m4rtijn> rns.. are yuo using click() function
[05:11:07] <m4rtijn> ?
[05:12:11] <wangdoo> m4rtijn:Did you find where i am going wrong?any alternative to that code.
[05:12:21] <makinen> how can I bound this to the the object which method makes $.ajax query and performs some action according the query inside complete method?
[05:12:57] <rns> m4rtijn, yes this is what I am using - http://dpaste.com/561275/
[05:13:21] <m4rtijn> rns.. k so you use the live
[05:13:28] <m4rtijn> should be fine actually
[05:13:55] <rns> m4rtijn, I am setting cookies to remember the UI tabs selected.  Could it be a bug the JQUI?
[05:14:40] <m4rtijn> rns, i dont think so
[05:14:52] <rns> m4rtijn, what else could it be?
[05:15:17] <m4rtijn> rns: i know there are examples on the UI page to save tabs in a cookie though
[05:15:24] <m4rtijn> I used one once and it worked fine
[05:16:38] <makinen> http://pastebin.com/U34Sy25V
[05:17:08] <rns> m4rtijn, well it does work fine with a full page refresh...
[05:17:22] <makinen> hope an example makes more sense than my poorly stated question :P

[05:18:07] <administrato>     这个文件是用来编辑您所要展示的文章而设计的。如果您想要
[05:18:08] <administrato> 展示自己的或别人的文字才料，008BOT将可以很好的为你提供在聊
[05:18:09] <administrato> 天网络上展示的机会。
[05:18:10] <administrato>     008BOT文章展示选项里为您提供简单方便的展示功能，主要有
[05:18:11] <administrato> 以下几大功能：
[05:18:12] <administrato> 1、编辑展示文章。
[05:18:13] <administrato>     此功能主要是为了很好的在mIRC32上完美的显示文章内容，尽
[05:18:14] <administrato> 量减少文字出现乱码的情况发生。
[05:18:15] <administrato>     编辑方法如下：
[05:18:16] <administrato>     进入编辑前首先设定文章标题，然后才能进入编辑器编辑文章
[05:18:17] <administrato>     在您完全看懂次说明后，将本文件上现有文字删除掉，仅保留
[05:18:18] <administrato> 文件最上一行和最后一行的==号线，因为此线是用来限定每行文字
[05:18:19] <administrato> 数量的比较线，所以以后要将粘贴进来的文字以此线对齐，每一行
[05:18:20] <administrato> 的文字尽量不要超出此线的长度，以免造成显示汉字乱码的现象发
[05:18:21] <administrato> 生。如果你的昵称比较长，那么以此线为基准就有可能出现在一行
[05:18:22] <administrato> 里没有显示完，而另起一行并且出现乱码现象，这时您可以适当减
[05:18:22] <buzzman> i'm trying to hide a menu from loading when a Lightframe loads ... the code works but in a reverse way ... plz take a look here, it's explained in detail:   http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[05:18:23] <administrato> 少每行的文字数量，以保证完整显示。
[05:18:24] <administrato>     你可以在此文件里使用各种文本符号，但不能定义颜色。
[05:18:25] <administrato> 2、设定播放速度。
[05:18:26] <administrato>     这个功能用来设定在大窗和小窗里展示文章时的速度，共有10
[05:18:27] <administrato> 个等级(即1―10)。1级最慢以每行3.5秒的速度显示,以后随着设置
[05:18:28] <administrato> 的级数增加显示速度不断加快。如果您想以最快的速度传输给对方
[05:18:29] <administrato> 就可以用10级。(注意:文章展示功能需要占用大量的网络资源，在
[05:18:30] <administrato> 使用中尽量放慢显示速度，而且要争得屋主或对方同意后再进行播
[05:18:31] <administrato> 放，以免遭到攻击。)
[05:18:32] <administrato> 3、播放展示文章。
[05:18:33] <administrato>     当点击此选项时，008BOT将按照你设定的速度进行播放。
[05:18:34] <administrato> 4、停止播放文章。
[05:18:35] <administrato>     将终止目前播放的文章。

[05:33:54] <IRCOperater> You there?
[05:34:03] <Soothsayer> What's a recommended plugin for overlay boxes?
[05:34:16] <Soothsayer> For example, when you are on this page http://digg.com/submit?partner=addthis&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongodb.org%2F&title=MongoDB&bodytext= and you click the "Join Digg" button
[05:34:27] <Soothsayer> the signup form appears in a popup
[05:35:23] <buzzman> lightbox
[05:35:26] <fire> Hi. Is it better and faster if i create an link with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="myclass.function();">link</a> or with $('a').click() ?
[05:35:33] <buzzman> or rather Lightframe
[05:36:00] <markj> fire always attach events in the second way, dont use onclick
[05:36:15] <Soothsayer> buzzman, can't find lightframe
[05:36:16] <buzzman> can someone plz help with this? it's probably adding / changing a word or 2 for someone who knows jquery well:  http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[05:36:55] <buzzman> Soothsayer:  actually lightframe is part of Lightbox ... sry for the confusion
[05:37:18] <markj> Soothsayer my recommendation would be colorbox
[05:37:25] <markj> ?g colorbox @ Soothsayer
[05:37:26] <bot-t1> Soothsayer, ColorBox - customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 ... - http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[05:38:12] <fire> markj: ok, thank you. Sometimes i want to assign an string or id to the .click(), where should i store this? currently i use <a href="paginate/next/2"></a> and extract the pageno within .click(); but it isn't always good, because if there is an js prob, the browser navigates to url.com/paginate/next/2
[05:38:26] <Soothsayer> markj, ye, had that on my mind
[05:38:50] <buzzman> markj:  hi there ... can u plz help with this issue ... http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[05:38:57] <Soothsayer> but was actually considering facebox - http://defunkt.io/facebox/
[05:39:19] <g0bl1n> can't bind a load() event to a SELECT element, right ?
[05:40:34] <IRCOperater> #windows

[05:45:00] <Lee_msi> in a jquery ui widget plugin. when i bind click event to a plugin method,
[05:46:14] <Lee_msi> in a jquery ui widget plugin. when i bind click event to a plugin method "this" refers to the button element it was fired on, and not the widget. So i cant do "this.headerbar.css()". do i need to pass "this" as a paramaters to the function or is there a better way
[05:47:49] <buzzman> looks like nobody is available for help today ... :(
[05:48:20] <markj> buzzman id try and help but i dont know the plugin
[05:49:11] <Soothsayer> wow, its too difficult to pick an overlay plugin
[05:49:17] <Soothsayer> there's this one too - http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/index.html
[05:49:34] <markj> id still recommend colorbox :]
[05:50:11] <pissypaw> sup
[05:50:32] <Soothsayer> markj: ye, I've narrowed it down to three and colorbox is one of them.. reading further
[05:50:54] <Soothsayer> and colorbox is as recently updated as May 11, 2011
[05:50:56] <buzzman> markj:  hi thnx for replying ... but my Qs was really nothing to do with the plugin ... if u take a look @ this fiddle, then u can see that i have just added simple jq code to get this working ... now all i need is for someone to show me how to have it working inside the lightframe area instead of the code applying to the parent page ... plz take a look here ...   http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[05:53:16] <buzzman> markj:  so basically my Qs is really asking how to have jq code apply to any loaded iframe instead of applying to the parent which is what it does by default ...
[05:54:13] <buzzman> markj:  by "parent" i mean the parent page on which the Lightframe enabled link exists ...
[05:54:16] <smokey_> Hello everyone!

[05:54:44] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps
[05:55:04] <mrmagoo1982> i have some html returned from window.send_to_editor = function(html) {
[05:55:11] <smokey_> I like to know, are there examples, for jquery,
[05:55:19] <buzzman> what's so special about google plus ?
[05:55:26] <mrmagoo1982> the html = <img src="pathtoimage" class="a class name" />
[05:55:28] <smokey_> where I can put up smething, as can be done with CPAINT?
[05:55:51] <mrmagoo1982> i'm trying to access the src and the class value from this code but having troubles
[05:56:06] <mrmagoo1982> var theurl = jQuery('img',html).attr('src');  - url is undefined
[05:56:15] <mrmagoo1982> am i doing this wrong?
[05:56:39] <erichynds> make sure that jquery selector matches an element, mrmagoo1982
[05:57:04] <buzzman> mrmagoo1982:  if it doesn't work it follows that u must b doing smthing wrong ... ;-)
[05:58:00] <coldhead> ?welcome @ pissypaw
[05:58:00] <bot-t1> pissypaw, http://qikr.co/files/pics/c/cavvljpg40802.jpg
[05:58:12] <juria_roberts> is it possible to change the source code of an iframe?
[05:59:43] <Soothsayer> markj, you there? In colorbox, when you are implementing such a login or signup form like that example I showed, would you load the content via ajax ?
[06:00:21] <smokey_> where can i find some examples, where I have a javascript on the client side, that passes some data to serve, where the result, is send to the javascript?
[06:00:51] <smokey_> I've read some things about jquery
[06:00:59] <smokey_> but my english is limited. :(
[06:01:02] <aaronmcadam> read some more :D
[06:01:05] <markj> Soothsayer if the login form needs to be pulled into the lightbox i would either use ajax to grab the content, or use a server side include to add the markup to the page on any pages i need it
[06:01:16] <coldhead> mine too, smokey_
[06:01:20] <markj> if it needs to be on multiple pages anyway
[06:01:22] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[06:01:31] <smokey_> mine too :(
[06:01:32] <wpsmith> @coldhead nice to see you again so early
[06:01:35] <buzzman> he he ...
[06:01:43] <coldhead> it's my 11pm, wpsmith
[06:01:45] <smokey_> I've used with success, Cpaint
[06:01:47] <coldhead> i will fade soon
[06:01:57] <Soothsayer> markj, so you first fetch using ajax $.get ? and then pass it to colorbox ?
[06:02:01] <smokey_> wich can dotthe same as jquery
[06:02:11] <smokey_> but jquery is much more expanded,
[06:02:20] <smokey_> en Cpaint is out of development. :S
[06:02:36] <wpsmith> @coldhead, wow...nice, so how do I get the elements to appear properly when I return to the page? they reveal properly when I am on the page, but when I update and come back to the page the proper elements do not appear
[06:02:41] <IRCOperater> A woman?
[06:02:41] <buzzman> smokey_:  yea like an elastic band ...
[06:02:50] <markj> colorbox has a href option Soothsayer that does it internally
[06:03:10] <Soothsayer> markj: ha, got it. Didn't expect it to be called href.
[06:03:34] <buzzman> markj:  any ida on my issue ... ?
[06:03:45] <buzzman> markj: * idea
[06:03:47] <smokey_> I just want to send an argument, or some data to server, and server sends me back some data
[06:03:49] <markj> sorry i havent looked, someone else might be able to help i need to jumpin the shower
[06:04:25] <buzzman> markj:  k ... nop ... try not to drown in da shower tho ... ;-)
[06:04:37] <Soothsayer> markj: so say the login form is login.php and through colorbox I'd do a $('#loginBtn').colorbox({href:"login.php"})
[06:04:50] <Soothsayer> it will fetch the contents of login.php and inject it within the DOM
[06:05:11] <Soothsayer> but, I've to make sure the javascript that is required for login form validation, etc already exists from before right ?
[06:06:07] <buzzman> Soothsayer:  i think he just said he's gonna jumin da shower ... :p
[06:06:17] <buzzman> Soothsayer:  jumpin
[06:06:45] <Soothsayer> oh, missed that. though, I'd think that was for you :-P
[06:07:57] <buzzman> Soothsayer:  u mean he might just jumpout for u ... rofl ... ;-)
[06:08:05] <Soothsayer> haha
[06:08:41] <buzzman> :p
[06:08:47] <Trudko> guys look here first line is returning null by second I get object http://jsfiddle.net/QFgYE/
[06:09:04] <Trudko> I thought that if jquery .size() return 0 then there was not found object with that id
[06:09:22] <Trudko> but if so document.getELement. etc should retun null
[06:09:57] <coldhead> wpsmith: i'm sorry, remind me which page we are talking about?
[06:10:17] <wpsmith> http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-admin/upload.php?page=wp-accordion username: guest pw: Password1/
[06:10:37] <wpsmith> @coldhead
[06:11:07] <dismist> man u just gave out your damn wp login?
[06:11:10] <dismist> the hell?
[06:11:12] <coldhead> i don't remember images >_<
[06:11:12] <buzzman> can someone plz help with this? it's probably adding / changing a word or 2 for someone who knows jquery well:  http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[06:11:23] <coldhead> lol i am still signed in
[06:12:16] <coldhead> oh okay, wpsmith. maybe what you want is to do $('select').trigger('change')
[06:12:29] <coldhead> which will make your fancy code change run immediately
[06:12:42] <doncams> $('selector').animate({bottom: '0'}, 500); works in FF5 but not in Chrome T_T
[06:12:44] <coldhead> do that just after you bind the change handlers
[06:12:57] <coldhead> lol bottom
[06:12:58] <buzzman> i'm trying to get some feedback on this issue since last 1 hour & 15 mins ... but still no cheeze ... :-(
[06:13:01] <b0ot> Is it possible to use jqgrid without having sql database, but just reading info directly off a json file on the server?
[06:14:01] <wpsmith> @coldhead so do $('select').trigger('change') instead of $(".link-posttypes select").change(function(){
[06:14:21] <coldhead> no no, you still want to do the change(function .. stuff
[06:14:25] <coldhead> pay attention
[06:14:29] <wpsmith> ok
[06:14:30] <wpsmith> ok
[06:14:36] <coldhead> you bind the change function
[06:14:42] <laerti> aaronmcadam: are u there?
[06:14:43] <coldhead> which makes things happen when there is a change
[06:14:57] <coldhead> but you also want to fake like that change happened, to make it all run when the page loads
[06:15:01] <coldhead> and you do that with trigger
[06:15:07] <wpsmith> ok
[06:15:07] <buzzman> b0ot:  my idea wud be to provide the data @ the point where the sql returns the data ...
[06:15:19] <wpsmith> makes sense conceptually
[06:16:29] <buzzman> anyone wants to give this a shot:  http://jsfiddle.net/AgDVb/
[06:17:02] <dismist>       if (e.preventDefault) { e.preventDefault(); }
[06:17:04] <dismist> wtf is that
[06:17:29] <madprops> what can i do to change the .click function of an input button?
[06:17:56] <dismist> $('#button').click(function($) { .... ; return false; }
[06:18:00] <dismist> );
[06:18:09] <smurfke> dismist one is a property the other a function
[06:18:18] <ThiefMaster|work> why would you pass $ to that function?
[06:18:27] <ThiefMaster|work> the first arg is not jQuery but an event object
[06:18:29] <laerti> i have a slider finally make it works but the slides overlap each other  any solution?
[06:18:43] <buzzman> dismist:  yea ... not my code dude ... it's how they wrote Lightframe ... :-)
[06:18:47] <ThiefMaster|work> ew
[06:19:39] <buzzman> ThiefMaster|work:  can we make it work to hide the menu inside the Lightframe ... ?
[06:20:24] <buzzman> dismist:  any idea on how to get this puppy home ... ?
[06:20:42] <laerti> i have a slider finally make it works but the slides overlap each other  any solution?
[06:21:38] <xec> buzzman: could you make a working demo to describe what youre trying to do? i mean, i get to the 4th character in your js and realize there is no <a> element to select...
[06:22:37] <Trudko> guys if $("#someid").size() returns 0 that means for sure that there is no element with this id?
[06:22:48] <xec> buzzman: only thing i understand clearly is the 3rd paragraph question, and i believe you can use the .css() method for that :)
[06:23:35] <markj> Trudko yes, or at least, at the time of calling size() there wasnt an element with that id
[06:24:09] <buzzman> xec:  thnx for replying ... well the code's a big soup cuz this is part of Drupal ... but I can confirm that the code as it is now works fine and does hide the menu BUT does it on the parent page and NOT on the page loaded inside the Lightframe ... does that make sense ... ?
[06:24:48] <Trudko> markJ  but why is that JS call document.getElementById returns with same id on next line object ? -
[06:24:51] <hemanth> Missing something : $('#view-widget').click(function(){$.post("./editor.php", { 'css[]' : ['A','B'] })});  ??
[06:25:02] <Trudko> http://jsfiddle.net/QFgYE/
[06:25:41] <buzzman> xec:  ahh yes, thnx for the CSS heads up ... totally forgot that ...
[06:26:51] <xec> buzzman: im not familiar with lightframe, does it create some <iframe> element inside a lightbox type of thing?
[06:27:00] <Trudko> markj: any idea?
[06:27:12] <buzzman> xec:  yes abso right u r ...
[06:27:15] <markj> Trudko make a working example and ill look
[06:27:20] <rahmen> Hi! I'm making some small jquery+html clients that fetch information from a server with ajax. Cross-site scripting that is. Is there any way I can get rid of warning signs and stuff from the browsers? I tried this: jQuery.support.cors = true; which actually allow me to do the calls. But IE constantly gives me new signs to click ok on. I update the information through the ajax script all the...
[06:27:21] <rahmen> ...time so it's pretty annoying :) Is there a good way or am I walking the wrong path? The goal is to only use client-side code so no php or stuff.
[06:27:55] <Trudko> cant really make working example from this  too complicated, any idea why in principle I am getting size 0 but on next line i find the element?
[06:27:56] <buzzman> xec:  so yes, basically what i'm trying to get done is have that code apply to the loaded iframe instead of the parent page ...
[06:28:05] <markj> urgh, give me a second
[06:28:42] <buzzman> Trudko:  some other JS is adding that perhaps ... ? look into that ?
[06:28:48] <MageHex> hi
[06:28:59] <MageHex> why did not work? http://pastebin.com/TvXeA1wZ
[06:29:05] <raver> help! :) http://jsfiddle.net/vsqaK/ the first ajax runs fine, but the second one (which is virtually identical except the field names and action) does not get hit..
[06:29:05] <Trudko> buzzman: what do u mean some other JS? its on nextt line
[06:29:10] <xec> buzzman: is the js included in the webpage that is loaded inside the iframe?
[06:30:11] <MageHex> buzzman, could you help me please?
[06:30:15] <buzzman> xec:  uh huh ... lemme chk ... sec plz ...
[06:31:01] <buzzman> MageHex:  i'm no jquery expert ... :-) someone here far more knowledgeable will perhaps ... bol ... :-)
[06:31:55] <markj> Trudko there is no reason why you could get 0 then find it no http://jsfiddle.net/QFgYE/3/
[06:31:57] <xec> MageHex: is this php code??
[06:32:08] <markj> unless as buzzman says, some other code is doing something
[06:32:43] <MageHex> xec, yes
[06:32:58] <xec> MageHex: you're in the wrong channel, mate :)
[06:33:10] <MageHex> no xec
[06:33:11] <MageHex> http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/
[06:33:18] <MageHex> Find tags on an HTML page with selectors just like jQuery.
[06:35:59] <xec> MageHex: well, then it could be defined as a css question as well - and "div[id=event_profile_guest_info][class=uiHeaderTitle]" will select a div with both the specified id and class, which does not exist in your html. maybe you want to try putting a space before the class
[06:36:19] <xec> MageHex: like "div#event_profile_guest_info .uiHeaderTitle"
[06:37:52] <raver> http://jsfiddle.net/vsqaK/ the first ajax runs fine, but the second one (which is virtually identical except the field names and action) does not get hit..
[06:37:54] <xec> MageHex: in case you didnt know; #name is shorthand for [id=name] and .name is shorthand for [class=name]
[06:38:27] <Axcy> Is there any way I can specify where a error div with validation should be placed?
[06:38:35] <Axcy> Right now it places itself between two radio buttons
[06:39:48] <xec> raver: try using delegates or .live() rather than .bind()
[06:40:53] <raver> thanks xec, live did the trick :)
[06:41:00] <xec> yw :)
[06:43:27] <buzzman> xec:  me back ... yep, the lightbox.js does get loaded in the iframe page as well ...
[06:43:52] <xec> buzzman: and thats where you have your code?
[06:45:20] <buzzman> xec:  but really strange that it don't execute this code on the ifarme page tho ... but this same code executes in the parent page (from where we click the lightframe enabled link to launch the lightframe) ...
[06:46:26] <buzzman> xec:  just saw ur Qs, yes this lightbox.js is the file where this code snip in the FIDDLE is at ...
[06:50:32] <worm> Hi all, the height of my radioButton is changed when the input box on its right is disabled/enabled, and I don't want that
[06:50:35] <worm> what should I do ?
[06:50:46] <buzzman> xec:  i now think that it maybe cuz the code only runs when u click on a lightframe enabled link ... that wud make sense as to why it runs in the parent and although the lightbox.js file loads inside the lightframe, since there is no lightframe-enabled link we are clicking there, the code therefore don't run there and so the dumb menu don't get hidden ... :-(
[06:52:10] <xec> buzzman: you might be on to something, i'd really have to see the whole thing to get a better picture of the situation, without its really all just guesswork
[06:52:51] <xec> and i should really get back to work ^^
[06:53:48] <xec> buzzman: one thing tho, you do $('#adm-menu').size() and $('#admin-menu').hide() - i assume they are two different elements and not a typo?
[06:54:28] <slartsa> Freaky question: I'm creating dynamic elements with input text inside. But since I need to see from source what I type in those input fields I figured the best way is to make this input also a value of the input fields. Is this the best way?
[06:55:09] <xec> slartsa: could you clarify what you mean by "see from source"?
[06:55:15] <buzzman> xec:  yes ur right ... it's very difficult to guess what's going on under da jquery hood here with so many thing all happening at once on the page ... but can u plz help me with a line of code that would only apply to an iframe if opened from a page (which we call the parent page) ... ?
[06:55:52] <xec> buzzman: hit me, cant guarantee i can help tho :)

[07:01:15] <clockwize_> hey guys, my page has a big of jquery on it, stuff that auto loads images, shows a spinner while it's loading, then fades it in etc.... but when I have like 15 images the page is quite slow and jumpy in chrome..any way to work out what's taking all the powar?
[07:01:59] <aaronmcadam> profiling clockwize_
[07:02:13] <aaronmcadam> you can set a profiler on chrome web tools
[07:02:33] <clockwize_> ah, sweet
[07:02:34] <aaronmcadam> will tell you what functions are taking the longest to run
[07:02:45] <aaronmcadam> you need to set it in your code

[07:05:30] <Absolute0> Is it possible to check where a js script was loaded from with the <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"> tag?
[07:05:32] <clockwize_> the top thing was one of my extensions ..
[07:05:59] <Absolute0> So for the above example 'ajax.googleapis.com' would be returned
[07:06:18] <aaronmcadam> Absolute0, put an id on the script
[07:06:31] <aaronmcadam> and do $( id ).attr( 'src');
[07:06:57] <Absolute0> aaronmcadam: the script is used by the client and I have no control over how they construct the script tag.
[07:07:11] <aaronmcadam> christ
[07:07:27] <aaronmcadam> if you have no idea where the script will appear?
[07:07:57] <lotjuh> heej (-:
[07:08:31] <aaronmcadam> could use a selector like $( 'script[src^="http://ajax.googleapis.com" ]);
[07:09:14] <lotjuh> is there anyone who can tell me if it's possible to create a widget what inherits from another widget with the standard jquery library?

[07:36:18] <jubberrue> Hi, I wrote a jQuery plugin (myPlugin) that needed to expose one of its function (myFunc) to be called from outside of the plugin. I solved the issue by by assigning myFunc to an object that was passed in as one of the options eg var myObj = new Object(); $(".myDiv").scrollAdaptor({proxyFunc:myObj}); then later on I can execute myObj.myFunc() . Is this solution following a design pattern?
[07:36:57] <b-lew> Can I score some jQuery help?

[07:58:13] <bamccaig> But sure enough, if I comment out the line then everything works fine... :\

[07:58:47] <edbaffei> hi guys.. please have a look at this.. what am i missing http://dpaste.com/561327/
[07:59:01] <bamccaig> mapper is a custom class; canvas is a jQuery object matching a <div>.
[07:59:11] <azatoth_work> b-lew, I can't dechipher your question
[07:59:26] <azatoth_work> edbaffei, state an quesiton please
[07:59:48] <gnrlbzik> git://gist.github.com/1056408.git
[07:59:48] <dan-work> azatoth_work, Thanks, but either I am misunderstanding you or it doesn't work: http://jsbin.com/exaqov/edit
[08:00:11] <b-lew> well by default when you load the page there is content then when you over over something on the left it swaps the content in and out
[08:00:29] <b-lew> I need the content to be blank on page load though.
[08:00:53] <bamccaig> edbaffei: Your code doesn't make any sense. Your get_val method is just registering an event handler.
[08:01:11] <azatoth_work> b-lew, that's a matter of css and design, and outside the matter og jQuery directly
[08:01:52] <azatoth_work> dan-work, what I meant is that if your flash has been loaded after document is ready, then you don't need to call js inside an separate closure
[08:01:54] <bamccaig> edbaffei: How is clicking a button going to change its text()?
[08:02:02] <edbaffei> bamccaig: well i want it to return the value of $(this).text() which i later want to use in an unrelated method
[08:02:03] <bamccaig> (Unless you explicitly do so..)
[08:02:06] <b-lew> hummm i'm confused but okay. sorry to bug
[08:02:10] <azatoth_work> np
[08:02:22] <bamccaig> edbaffei: I'm afraid you aren't making any sense.
[08:02:44] <b-lew> jquery ui tabs always defaults to the first one though
[08:02:45] <b-lew> doesn't it?
[08:02:46] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, you can link an http as well :)
[08:03:37] <bamccaig> edbaffei: Why would an unrelated method care about a button being clicked?
[08:03:51] <edbaffei> bamccaig:  yes.. i know.. but say i would like the value of a button's text to be sent to an unrelated method..as an argument
[08:04:13] <bamccaig> edbaffei: Then don't use the click event. Just go directly after the text.
[08:04:24] <dan-work> azatoth_work, So you are saying this should work in theory? http://jsbin.com/exaqov/2/edit
[08:04:27] <gnrlbzik> azatoth_work i cant link http
[08:04:34] <bamccaig> edbaffei: var button = jQuery(".my_button").text(); /* etc... */
[08:04:40] <rahmen> I'm trying to get an xml with ajax and jsonp but I'm not sure how to do this correctly. Details here: http://pastie.org/2145169
[08:04:45] <edbaffei> bamccaig: well am logging what the person has clicked
[08:04:47] <gnrlbzik> its local dev server
[08:04:57] <bamccaig> edbaffei: Then you should do it inside of the click handler.
[08:05:12] <gnrlbzik> so the question is
[08:05:34] <azatoth_work> dan-work, no, unless you know that the flash will only return when document is ready
[08:05:48] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, meant to github gist
[08:05:58] <azatoth_work> ie https://gist.github.com/1056408
[08:06:03] <gnrlbzik> sorry https://gist.github.com/1056408
[08:06:13] <gnrlbzik> plus updated the code too
[08:06:32] <gnrlbzik> so the question is
[08:06:44] <Absolute0> How can I do str.* in js regexp?
[08:06:59] <kborchers> rahmen: if you are trying to retrieve xml, why are you using JSONP as the data type? it should be xml. then in your success handler, do something with that xml
[08:07:01] <Absolute0> str.* doesnt seem to match str followed by anything or nothing
[08:07:08] <gnrlbzik> when i use clone method to clone the jquery object, and i assign that cloned object to variable
[08:07:42] <gnrlbzik> it looks like the previously created jquery object is not discarted
[08:07:43] <edbaffei> bamccaig: ok, but is there a way of making the click event available outside of the click method
[08:08:02] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, what calls createCategoryPage?
[08:08:10] <bamccaig> edbaffei: Not really, unless you store it somewhere. I'm not sure that makes sense though.
[08:08:23] <gnrlbzik> address plug in

[08:11:38] <dan-work> azatoth_work, Sorry but what do you mean by "return when document is ready"? Flash loads and then someone clicks a button, and the function is called. Would that count as "return when the document is ready"?
[08:12:02] <kborchers> rahmen: JSONP is for retrieving JSON data cross-site, not xml. you're telling jquery to try to convert your xml to a javascript object when you do that

[08:24:39] <gnrlbzik> let me include that method in code, one sec
[08:24:47] <edbaffei> bamccaig: aah.. yea.. creating an array outside and pushing to it
[08:25:38] <bamccaig> edbaffei: It depends /when/ you want the code to fire though. If you want it to fire whenever the button is clicked then you can just do it directly from the click handler (have no need for an external array or *ugh* interval).
[08:25:59] <gnrlbzik> azatoth_work refresh code
[08:26:12] <gnrlbzik> let me know once you did
[08:26:52] <rahmen> kborchers: http://pastie.org/2145292 I want to solve this with client-side code only.. so I can't fetch the xml with php or the like. The idea is to fetch stuff from a server just like an API. But only with client-side code.
[08:27:20] <edbaffei> bamccaig: hmnn.. like bind to the click event and keep updating it whenever its cliked
[08:27:24] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, ok, can you recap that actual problem again?
[08:27:42] <gnrlbzik> there a memory leak
[08:27:48] <edbaffei> bamccaig: thanks
[08:27:50] <rahmen> kborchers: so the question is if I have to use jsonp and therefor change my output from the api-server?
[08:27:52] <gnrlbzik> it looks like when i use clone
[08:27:54] <gnrlbzik> method
[08:28:01] <azatoth_work> bamccaig, gnrlbzik, edbaffei: your nicks looks for me just as a bouynch of random letters :-P
[08:28:16] <gnrlbzik> i try : )

[08:29:41] <gnrlbzik> nope, latest
[08:29:47] <azatoth_work> ok
[08:29:59] <gnrlbzik> after 5 clicks
[08:30:06] <gnrlbzik> you can litterly feel that its slow
[08:30:15] <Venkat1> Hi
[08:30:22] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, I think it can be due to some non-local local variables
[08:30:29] <azatoth_work> ?jshint
[08:30:29] <bot-t1> http://jshint.com/
[08:30:33] <Venkat1> I have a redenering issue for thickbox on IPAD
[08:30:41] <azatoth_work> I would suggest testing your code with jshint
[08:30:45] <Venkat1> *rendering
[08:30:57] <gnrlbzik> well i defined application
[08:31:04] <gnrlbzik> and then extend it with prototype
[08:31:20] <gnrlbzik> one sex
[08:31:22] <gnrlbzik> sec
[08:31:23] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, for example you have productLocalLoopElem outside the function
[08:31:32] <gnrlbzik> yep
[08:31:33] <azatoth_work> defined*
[08:31:45] <azatoth_work> and you con'y uses it inside the function, so it should be local
[08:32:07] <gnrlbzik> and it is defined within
[08:32:08] <gnrlbzik> 	Application.prototype.MakePageLive = function(xmlpath, xmlpathrel) {
[08:32:20] <MoTiOnXml> <3 jQuery
[08:32:21] <azatoth_work> remember that scopes in JS isn't similar to other languages like C, java etc...
[08:32:23] <Venkat1> Can some one help me with thick box
[08:32:42] <gnrlbzik> the reason why i moved them out of the actuall function
[08:32:47] <kborchers> rahmen: i assume you don't have control over that server that the xml is coming from, correct? if not, you can't do this. you can't force that server to provide something clientside that it is told not to do. see ?sop
[08:32:48] <bot-t1> rahmen, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:32:54] <gnrlbzik> i gained perfrmance increase
[08:33:03] <kborchers> rahmen: also read this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3068473/use-jsonp-to-get-xml-cross-domain
[08:33:22] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, which browser do you use?
[08:33:40] <gnrlbzik> ie7+, chrome, ff3.6+ safari 5
[08:33:42] <azatoth_work> and could it be possible to gain access to test a working example
[08:33:48] <Venkat1> Positioning issue for thick box on IPAD
[08:34:02] <gnrlbzik> unfortunately no  : /
[08:34:06] <azatoth_work> ok
[08:34:11] <gnrlbzik> i wish
[08:34:19] <gnrlbzik> would solve so much stuff if i could
[08:34:35] <azatoth_work> well gnrlbzik, use jshint and OBEY is something I can tell you at least :)
[08:35:16] <MoTiOnXml> recommended jQuery cookie plugin?
[08:35:43] <gnrlbzik> looking at it right now
[08:35:46] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, you've no access to create a tunnle?
[08:36:08] <gnrlbzik> hope
[08:36:10] <azatoth_work> if you are using *nix, then node-jshint is recommendable
[08:36:27] <rahmen> kborchers: ok then I have to edit the server's output... Correct me if I'm wrong but this is the reason why jsonp exists - I can't fetch my information unless I get jsonp working? I really want  to be sure about this before I edit the server-code..
[08:36:59] <rahmen> kborchers: and according to your link I should be able to fetch xml-data also, right?
[08:37:09] <kborchers> rahmen: do you control the server that is serving the xml?
[08:37:26] <rahmen> kborchers: not right now but I will be able to edit it yes
[08:37:50] <rahmen> kborchers: I would have liked a different way around this that's why I'm asking you so much :P
[08:38:53] <gnrlbzik> azatoth_work is there a way to check wich jquery objects are still in memory
[08:38:56] <gnrlbzik> and delete them?
[08:39:20] <azatoth_work> you get the same issue on all browsers?
[08:39:24] <gnrlbzik> yes
[08:39:28] <gnrlbzik> i am most certain
[08:39:40] <MoTiOnXml> recommended jQuery cookie plugin?
[08:39:44] <gnrlbzik> its becuase jquery object are note grabage collected
[08:39:44] <MoTiOnXml> come on? :)
[08:40:14] <MoTiOnXml> gnrlbzik: so how do you release jQuery objects?

[08:40:44] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, they are gced unless a reference is still locked onto them
[08:41:27] <kborchers> rahmen: ok, then you have two choices. one, leave your data as XML and wrap it in a JSONP callback. two, reformat that data as JSON and wrap it in a JSONP callback. either way, the callback has to be added on the server side to get around the SOP issue. then your ajax call has to set the datatype to jsonp
[08:41:40] <z1000> anyone know an easy way to have 3 elements shown and only scroll 1 at a time? http://p7dev.com/yatco/1/ using the cycle plugin... any suggestions ?
[08:41:41] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, when you said "pages" beforee, I assume you meant that it's not http load of new pages, but the current page is updated with new data?
[08:41:50] <gnrlbzik> yes
[08:41:55] <gnrlbzik> i have placeholders
[08:41:57] <janthony> If I have an element that will be visibile 9 out of 10 times, but I always have fadeIn(), so it's only fading in that 1 out of 10 times, is it better to do a conditional statement with if .is(:visible) or does it really not matter? Are there load considerations when coding that way, or other complications I could run into?
[08:42:06] <kborchers> rahmen: the first option adds a layer of complexity and i have never done it so don't know how it will work. the second is the right way to do it
[08:42:09] <gnrlbzik> into which dynamically generated mark up is palce
[08:42:23] <gnrlbzik> before i generate new mark up and insert all the stuff into it
[08:42:25] <MoTiOnXml> gnrlbzik: thanks, will check it out
[08:42:34] <gnrlbzik> i will invoke, empty()
[08:42:38] <gnrlbzik> on the placeholder
[08:42:39] <MoTiOnXml> gnrlbzik: looking @ https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-Cookie now
[08:42:43] <azatoth_work> ok
[08:42:57] <gnrlbzik> and i assume that it should remove all the jquery objects
[08:43:36] <rahmen> kborchers: ok thanks a alot! I feel pretty confident on what to do now.
[08:43:49] <gnrlbzik> may be i should invoke same principle on three other peice of dynamic code
[08:43:52] <kborchers> rahmen: np, glad to help
[08:43:56] <azatoth_work> ?.empty
[08:43:56] <bot-t1> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[08:45:05] <z1000> any ideas anyone?
[08:45:10] <janthony> Anyone?
[08:45:37] <azatoth_work> gnrlbzik, well, when you have a page like that, try to never use global variables, like pagePlaceHolderCategory for example
[08:46:09] <gnrlbzik> you think thats that issue?
[08:46:32] <gnrlbzik> that i never completely get read of the dom objects that i create?
[08:47:07] <gnrlbzik> even when i apply empty() on that placeholder?
[08:47:45] <azatoth_work> empty only removes the element from the dom and their data, you still might have references to them in your code, and then they're stuck :)
[08:48:27] <z1000> anyone worked well with cycle plugin?
[08:49:07] <azatoth_work> as you've got the variable definitions outside the functions that uses them as internal variables, they will still be referencing the objects after function has returned
[08:49:56] <kborchers> janthony: when you do your fadeIn(), just add :hidden to the selector so do something like ("#hiddenElement:hidden").fadeIn(duration); that way it should only run when it finds that element and it's hidden
[08:50:02] <gnrlbzik> ubt i overwirte the refference each and everytime
[08:50:06] <gnrlbzik> but*
[08:50:37] <janthony> kborchers: But I don't want it to always to fadeIn. My question was based around best practices and performance.
[08:50:38] <gnrlbzik> i call empty on the placeholde which would include new build out
[08:50:57] <gnrlbzik> and then variables also get overwitten with new objects that are created by clone()
[08:51:22] <Axcy> Anyone worked with Jquery and the validation of radio buttons? I'm gonna go crazy soon <<
[08:53:32] <mosez> http://pastie.org/2145399 does this look like a bad wrapper for ui slider? =)
[08:54:05] <kborchers> janthony: without actually looking at fadeIn()'s code, I can't tell you if it runs or not. If it does run on the already visible element, there would be only one step in the animation before it stops. i would say performance wise, the difference is probably negligible. As for best practices, I am not sure there but I would imagine the best practice is to not run fadeIn() if it isn't necessary
[08:54:46] <sadmicrowave> question guys.  I have a list of list-items each of which has an attribute named "completed" which varies between 0 and 1.  I need to get the 'id' of the first-child with completed=0.  This does not work: $("li.foo[completed='0']:first-child").attr('id')
[08:55:12] <sadmicrowave> nor does this: $("li.foo[completed='0']").first().attr('id')
[08:55:15] <janthony> kborchers: Ok, thanks. I didn't know if jquery already had conditional statements built in to not do a fadeIn to increase performance if the element was already visible on the dom.
[08:55:51] <Mindore> hi there :) I want to get the childindex for the parent object
[08:56:40] <Mindore> $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias)   get the object -> div#node-49.node
[08:57:01] <gnrlbzik> alright azatoth_work, thanks for the try  : ) will go bang my head against the wall
[08:57:06] <gnrlbzik> maybe it will help : )
[08:57:26] <azatoth_work> heh
[08:58:17] <Mindore> .view-content .views-row #node-49 is my html structure
[08:58:29] <kborchers>  sadmicrowave: just trying to simplify your question in my head. so you need to select on the foo class as well?
[08:59:23] <Mindore> i need to know the index of .views-row inside the .view-content where the #node-49 exists
[09:00:02] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, well I'm trying to identify the list-item I'm using because I have multiple list items throughout the page so I can't do $("li") or that would confuse the selector
[09:00:27] <sadmicrowave> to answer your question, yes
[09:00:39] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: ok, that's what i figured, just thinking it through because your code looks good
[09:01:20] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: can you give a little more context in a fiddle?
[09:02:33] <alexwait> I'm using the link() library + jQuery templating library. I want to convert a MySQL formatted date as it is put onto the form. Any way to do this?
[09:03:21] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I'd love to but what I posted here is really all there is to it..
[09:03:45] <alexwait> I've put in a convert and convertBack field for this field in question, but neither are called on initial page load (of course)
[09:04:00] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I think there may be something else wrong with this, hold on I'm checking
[09:06:38] <VictorCL2> if  .html() gets the innerHTml  how can I get the element  .. like if I have <img id='image-one' src='../image.jpg' />   and I want to copy that <img so I can reuse it and past it later
[09:06:49] <iEatChildren> is there a way to make datepicker go fullscreen?
[09:07:03] <alexwait> holy moley. full screen!? :D
[09:07:21] <iEatChildren> its strictly for the mobile version of a website im working on
[09:07:38] <alexwait> oh hehe :P
[09:07:42] <Axcy> Would radio buttons be considdered siblings?

[09:09:37] <kborchers> Axcy: only if they are at the same level in the dom. the element type doesn't determine their relationship
[09:10:53] <Mindore> with this selector i get the right object... $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).parent());
[09:11:07] <Mindore> but how can i get which index it has inside its parent?
[09:11:08] <Axcy> kborchers: I'm trying to conjure up some code which'll add the error labels after the last radio button of a grp called "names"
[09:11:34] <Axcy> I found error.insertAfter(element.siblings('input[type="radio"][name="' + element.attr('name') + '":last')); - On google, but can't seem to get it to work
[09:11:56] <Axcy> The radio buttons have different id's - But share the same name(Obviously)
[09:12:50] <kborchers> Axcy: try error.insertAfter($("input[type='radio'][name='names']:last"));
[09:14:28] <sadmicrowave> kborchers[A], I figured it out, my completed attribute wasn't returning into the list what I thought it should
[09:15:12] <sadmicrowave> kborchers[A], just to satisfy my curiosity, which one of the two methods I explained would you choose? which do you believe is better?
[09:16:12] <Mindore> $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).parent().parent().index($('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).parent())
[09:16:19] <Mindore> something like that? but it wont work :)
[09:17:17] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: I would probably go with your first solution. i'm not sure on performance but that seems like you are immediately selecting the element rather than selecting a group and doing another filter. just my opinion though
[09:17:40] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I agree, thanks for your perspective
[09:17:44] <kborchers> np
[09:18:19] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, scratch that, the first method doesn't work lol
[09:19:21] <kborchers> interesting. seems like it's the same thing but maybe it doesn't like the [] notation coupled with the : selector.
[09:19:31] <sadmicrowave> thats what I'm thinking
[09:19:39] <sadmicrowave> either way, .first() it is!
[09:19:42] <kborchers> cool

[09:36:39] <Mindore> theres my code... i get the classes "michael-jackson and james-brown" on the click and saves them in the variable named alias
[09:38:24] <vinmassaro> anyone know how to capture the click and hold then let go action typical on a mac trackpad?
[09:38:45] <sven_oostenbrink> Is this correct?  $.post({url: 'site/ajax/go.php', data: $(this).serialize(), success: function(){}, error: function(){}});
[09:39:11] <lacrymology> how do I change an element's tag? turn a <p> into an <h3>?
[09:39:13] <Mindore> so when i click on the michael-jackson link i want to know the index of .views-row that contains the node with the michael-jacksson class
[09:39:16] <sven_oostenbrink> The chrome console gives me POST http://localhost/k/test/[object%20Object] 404 (Not Found) for that..
[09:40:18] <context-> is there a way to easily 'attach' a js object to a dom object so it can easily be referenced later
[09:40:51] <context-> think i want .data()
[09:41:17] <Dambfhase> Mindore: what is this in your handler? ie. where is the a you bind to?
[09:41:53] <Dambfhase> sven_oostenbrink: what is `this` in your case?
[09:42:35] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: A form which received a submit event
[09:43:03] <guy> I have 4 $.ajax requests.
[09:43:14] <guy> how to trigger an event only when they are all done?
[09:43:23] <guy> i.e. success is triggered on all of them
[09:44:24] <guy> is there a way say to trigger an event when variable foo gets value 'bar'?
[09:44:40] <Dambfhase> sven_oostenbrink: try the data thing without serializing first
[09:44:42] <Mindore> Dambfhase: $('.view-showreferences .views-field-phpcode a').click(function() <- there is my click function and when i click on a link with that selector i get the class from that link and saves it in var alias
[09:44:51] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: doing..
[09:45:20] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: same error: POST http://localhost/k/test/[object%20Object] 404 (Not Found)
[09:45:51] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: Its as if it takes the string as an object... (yeah, strictly speaking it is, etc.. but this should not happen, should it?)
[09:46:13] <Dambfhase> nom this shouldnt happen. which version do you use?
[09:46:19] <kborchers> guy: i would have a var for each request that is set to true on sucess. in each success, call a function that checks those vars and only executes when all are true (i.e. the last one), then sets them all back to false when done
[09:46:23] <Mindore> so either alias is "michael-jackson" or "james-brown"
[09:46:33] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: I dumbed it down to $.post({url : 'site/ajax/logindo.php'});
[09:47:48] <Dambfhase> Mindore: try $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).index() << withou any args
[09:48:21] <Mindore> '#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias <- with this selector i get the right object... but i want to know the index of its parent inside my selectors parent parent
[09:48:37] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: Im being restricted to v1.3.2
[09:49:00] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: how would I, in v1.3.2, be able to specify a success and an error handler?
[09:49:06] <Dambfhase> sven_oostenbrink: ok, it could be the version or the fact that chrome forbids requests to local files.
[09:49:15] <Mindore> .index() returns -1
[09:49:37] <Dambfhase> Mindore: that means your selector is wrong
[09:50:03] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: I think its the version, because when I had it structured with arguments instead of the {a:x, b:x, etc } it was working fine, but failed on .success().error(), which is from v1.5 and up
[09:50:36] <Dambfhase> yeah, 1.3.2 is really really old
[09:50:44] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: and since I need a success and error handler, I thought to rewrite it to be {a:x, b:x, etc}.. but thats not accepted by post :(
[09:50:58] <sven_oostenbrink> Dambfhase: at least not in that version of jquery..
[09:51:15] <Mindore> $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).index()
[09:51:26] <sven_oostenbrink> How would I specify both a success and error handler in v1.3.2 for $.post() ?
[09:51:30] <Mindore> $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).parent().index()
[09:51:31] <acidjazz> lol wat
[09:51:34] <Mindore> $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias).parent().parent().index()
[09:51:37] <acidjazz> jesus
[09:51:43] <Mindore> have tested all those...
[09:51:43] <acidjazz> do u know care about cpus?
[09:52:27] <kborchers> ?demo @ Mindore
[09:52:27] <bot-t1> Mindore, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:52:42] <Dambfhase> Mindore: if $('#ensembleslider .view-showreferences .view-content > .views-row .'+alias) is already empty, doing .parent() will not help!
[09:54:28] <Mindore> console.log(alias) returns "michael-jackson" or "james-brown" depending on which link
[09:55:22] <Dambfhase> Mindore: whay dont you just do only $('.'+alias) ?
[09:55:44] <Dambfhase> or maybe $('div.'+alias)
[09:56:01] <kborchers> Mindore: i was just typing a much longer response with the same point ^^^^
[09:56:06] <Mindore> because my link has the same class. but $('div.'+alias) should work
[09:57:01] <tystr> is it good practice to assign selectors used multiple times in a script to a variable? how noticeable is the performance improvement (if any)?
[09:57:17] <ocf> 'llo all. creating a dynamic table via a $.ajax. I insert that table into a div with min-height: 300px. If the table is too large, the div cuts off at 300px. How does a guy expand that div to fit? display: table-cell?
[09:57:24] <kborchers> tystr: yes, very good practice and big perf improvement
[09:57:30] <ocf> tystr - yes, very good idea
[09:57:32] <ocf> ^^^^ what he said
[09:57:34] <ocf> or she? :)
[09:57:48] <Dambfhase> tystr: caching the strting is not important, saving the selction is vital
[09:58:32] <kborchers> Dambfhase: good point. i assumed tystr meant the selection and not just the string
[09:58:49] <tystr> yeah, the actual selection
[09:58:50] <Dambfhase> you never know
[09:58:55] <Dambfhase> :)
[09:59:11] <kborchers> again, good point. ;)
[09:59:36] <tystr> I didn't know what the overhead was for jQuery to find something...
[10:00:17] <tystr> seemed like common sense to not repeat one's self....good to know it helps performance a bit as well :)
[10:02:39] <dankest> I'm writing a survey for research and I don't have access to the header part of the survey, only the onLoad part.  Can I still use jQuery?
[10:03:12] <tystr> so, being nit-picky now, if I have multiple selectors like $("#searchForm #someField") and $("#searchForm #another field"), would it make any difference to save $("#searchForm") to a variable?
[10:03:39] <Dambfhase> tystr: go to jsperf.com and find out!
[10:04:51] <tystr> Dambfhase: thanks, that site looks pretty cool...ill check it out and stop bugging everyone :)
[10:04:58] <Dambfhase> tystr: btw, you should never( very rarely) do a selectiion via 2 IDs
[10:05:16] <tystr> Dambfhase: really?
[10:05:19] <Mindore> could it be a jquery version problem? using jquery 1.3.2 :/
[10:05:43] <Dambfhase> the #someField ID should be enough since only one element of that ID can be in the document
[10:06:03] <Dambfhase> Mindore: yes it can be. upgrade.
[10:06:32] <tystr> that makes sense
[10:06:49] <Mindore> running drupal 6 so i think im stuck with 1.3.2 :/
[10:07:23] <Mindore> is there any other function to count current selectors parent inside parent parent
[10:07:55] <ocf> creating a dynamic table via a $.ajax. I insert that table into a div with min-height: 300px. If the table is too large, the div cuts off at 300px. How does a guy expand that div to fit? display: table-cell (boo)?
[10:08:48] <Dambfhase> Mindore: did you know, you can update you jquery even though you are on drupal?
[10:09:20] <Mindore> i have used a module called jquery update to get jquery 1.3.2... :/
[10:09:44] <Mindore> think its hard to make it stable on newer jquery version, but i might be wrong
[10:11:16] <ocf> </retard> had my div inside a spacer with height of 10. Durka.
[10:11:19] <Soothsayer> Anyone using jquery tools overlay plugin ?
[10:12:05] <Mindore> moving on to Drupal 7 will eliminate the low version of jquery problem... :)
[10:13:58] <acidjazz> moving to drupal anything sounds bad
[10:15:27] <changerOfSea> hi guys, is there a way i can get a parent thats n generations up from $(this)?
[10:17:52] <Mindore> think this will work... $('div.'+alias).parent().prevAll('div').size()
[10:18:45] <Dambfhase> changerOfSea: $(this).parents().eq( n) this is a bit hickish though. maybe use .closest() ?

[10:19:01] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/QvHej/ -- what am i doing wrong here?
[10:19:22] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/QvHej/1/
[10:19:38] <swiggy> click 'add note' should show a div that has a text area and button
[10:19:41] <swiggy> but its not appearing
[10:20:06] <swiggy> its pretty basic [i thought]
[10:21:30] <kborchers> swiggy: closest() searches up the tree through the elements ancestors
[10:21:37] <swiggy> .closest() doesnt need to be a child element does it?
[10:22:24] <swiggy> explain?
[10:23:02] <swiggy> ?find
[10:23:02] <bot-t1> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[10:23:04] <kborchers> swiggy: your link must be the child of what you are searching for with closest. why wouldn't you just say $(".addnotediv").show()?
[10:23:21] <swiggy> because therer are multiple ones
[10:23:49] <swiggy> i want the one closest to the button that was clicked [which is prettymuch directly below it]
[10:23:59] <kborchers> swiggy: then try changing closest() to siblings()
[10:24:13] <swiggy> its not a sibling tho
[10:24:18] <swiggy> ah
[10:24:19] <swiggy> wait
[10:24:22] <swiggy> you might be right
[10:24:27] <swiggy> ?sibling
[10:24:28] <bot-t1> swiggy, .siblings() - Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[10:25:17] <kborchers> swiggy: actually, looking closer it would need to be parent().siblings(".addnotediv") i think
[10:25:31] <swiggy> yeah sibling did not work
[10:25:46] <swiggy> the <a> tag that is controlling it is in a <legend> tag
[10:25:55] <swiggy> and the actual div is outside the legend tag, but inside the fieldset
[10:26:04] <Dambfhase> swiggy: $this.parent().nextAll('.addnotediv').first().show();
[10:26:05] <leo-rj-br> ~pastebin
[10:26:09] <kborchers> swiggy: right, see my last msg ^^^
[10:26:33] <Mindore> Dambfhase: (and u other) Thanks a lot for your time... :)
[10:26:50] <swiggy> ty Dambfhase
[10:26:54] <swiggy> i tried your kborchers
[10:26:56] <Dambfhase> :)
[10:27:00] <swiggy> but it did no different
[10:27:06] <swiggy> you were on the rigth path though :)
[10:27:08] <swiggy> ty both
[10:29:10] <Dambfhase> wow, i have to update my local copy of the ES5 spec. cool.
[10:32:53] <lacrymology> can someone give me a hand with this? http://pastebin.com/BGkRgggZ I'm having trouble with things not reflecting changes, I think I'm asuming stuff is handled by reference when it's handled by value, but I'm quite lost at this point
[10:33:42] <JAAulde> Hi all, we have a piece of code which does some XML manipulation and it broke in IE (at least 7) between jQuery 1.5 and 1.6. At this link is the chunk of code running on 1.5.2: http://jsfiddle.net/JAAulde/NVpWp/ and at this linke is the same exact code on 1.6.1: http://jsfiddle.net/JAAulde/NVpWp/1  The problem still exists in jQuery 1.6.2.  Has anyone else seen anything like this?
[10:34:11] <mts7> jstree + jquery ui tabs = a mess
[10:34:17] <leo-rj-br> anyone can help me with this ?? http://pastebin.com/mdVehHCY
[10:35:58] <Kambfhase> lacrymology: your `this` in line 21 is wrong, i guess
[10:36:30] <Kambfhase> or maybe not, dunno
[10:36:36] <lacrymology> Kambfhase: I thought that might be wrong, but I don't think it's the only thing.. and how do I solve that? because I need that 'this'
[10:37:06] <lacrymology> this that those them though..
[10:38:04] <kborchers> lacrymology: before entering the each, cache this in another var, like that (hehe), then you can say cnt.append(that) inside the each
[10:39:24] <lacrymology> kborchers: no, I want that this to be that.. I mean I want that this to be each 'content'
[10:39:54] <lacrymology> I guess I could just make var content = this.content before that, just to be sure
[10:40:04] <kborchers> lacrymology: then you are using 'this' correctly in that case
[10:41:07] <Kambfhase> leo-rj-br: what are you trying to do on line 17?
[10:41:17] <Kambfhase> ah, fuck, i mean line 16
[10:41:49] <leo-rj-br> Kambfhase, on line 4 i define a attribute called altfied
[10:42:01] <lacrymology> kborchers: actually, my problem's that ret doesn't reflect what I did AFTER that outer each
[10:42:04] <MoTiOnXml> welcome to the lottery - pick your GUID
[10:42:08] <MoTiOnXml> ready?
[10:42:17] <leo-rj-br> Kambfhase, i verify if this attribute really exists
[10:42:18] <MoTiOnXml> result: fe1abde9-f769-410f-be96-12927dc5e025
[10:42:21] <MoTiOnXml> did you win? :)
[10:42:58] <leo-rj-br> Kambfhase, but my problem even use the option on line 12 does not work with a simple return
[10:43:24] <Kambfhase> leo-rj-br: if an attribute is non existant .attr() will return `undefined` not false
[10:44:06] <leo-rj-br> but undefined === false right right ???!
[10:44:35] <Kambfhase> ?eval undefined === false @ leo-rj-br
[10:44:36] <bot-t1> leo-rj-br: false
[10:44:51] <Kambfhase> lacrymology: i thinnk i got it!
[10:45:11] <Kambfhase> or maybe not.
[10:45:27] <leo-rj-br> Kambfhase, this always make confusion, but why my in line function() does not work?
[10:46:16] <Kambfhase> $(this).attr('altfield') never returns false! therefor you will never enter the if block
[10:46:40] <muzone> How do I do a "PRICE RANGE" thing like on the side menu at http://www.asos.com/Women/Skirts/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=2639 ? That shit looks hot !!

[10:52:49] <Kambfhase> :D
[10:54:47] <timmywil> what's the bot-t1 command for last seen someone
[10:54:50] <Kambfhase> jonkristian: i think that is more like a browser issue. i have noted similar behaviour before

[10:56:44] <Kambfhase> dammit
[10:56:48] <kborchers> ;)
[10:56:50] <IanC> lol nice
[10:57:50] <IanC> very well, jQuery UI's autocomplete.  I have a flat JSON file of the format [ "item1, "item2", "item3"] and I put the URL to that file in the source parameter for autocomplete.  however, it fails to load anything from the file
[10:58:11] <Kambfhase> jonkristian: the code is good. i recommend using mouseenter/mouseleave over mouseover/mouseout though
[10:58:38] <IanC> I have tried a multitude of things, including .getJSON and .ajax to try and grab the contents of the file and stuff it in a string
[10:58:42] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: ok, but isn't that the same as using hover?
[10:59:50] <developerhealey2> A script i am using is messing up for some reason...   its continues adding an extra tag intermittly....      They all have the same ID....   is there a way for me to    cycle through each id....  example:   $("#id").each(function(
[10:59:58] <developerhealey2> but doesnt seem to be working
[11:00:21] <Kambfhase> well, there is small difference between mouseover and mouse enter. btw, why dont you use .fadeIn() ?
[11:00:35] <Kambfhase> ?valid id @ developerhealey2
[11:00:36] <bot-t1> developerhealey2, ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[11:00:48] <muzone> Kambfhase: please accept http://www.brainfeedersite.com/podpress_trac/web/2811/0/georgeduke.mp3 as a token of my appreciation for your support !!
[11:01:12] <jsadam1> Is there away to us ajaxStart on only specific ajax calls if there are more than I possibility on the page?
[11:01:32] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: I'll try that, thanks

[11:03:00] <developerhealey2> hmm.....  Kambfhase... i did not create the script
[11:03:02] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: hm, it appears to work better with fadeIn/Out
[11:03:08] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: -> ailoclothing.com
[11:03:32] <muzone> jonkristian: entreprenr?
[11:03:50] <lacrymology> is there something like x.parent().append(y) ?
[11:03:51] <developerhealey2> I just want to be able to select ALL divs where the ID = "imgPreviewContainer"       to hide it....
[11:03:59] <jonkristian> muzone: h忙?
[11:04:01] <lacrymology> like x.nextSibling(y) or something

[11:05:06] <Whirl3d> what is wrong with this statement:     var currButton=$(".topicButton").filter("a [href='#"+currTopic.attr("id")+"']");
[11:05:09] <Kambfhase> developerhealey2: ok, here comes the hack: $('div[id="foo"]').each()
[11:05:42] <developerhealey2> thanks Kamb...  i knew it was .each...
[11:05:49] <kborchers> Whirl3d: don't put a space after the a
[11:06:08] <developerhealey2> is that a regex is that why it will select all of them...  instead of just doing what i did before
[11:06:39] <Whirl3d> kborchers, still getting the same error: Unrecognized expression ['href']
[11:06:45] <Whirl3d> kborchers, thanks for the reply, btw
[11:07:37] <IanC> Sample: http://jsfiddle.net/KxCp6/
[11:07:47] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: does it appear to work fine for you now? And do you by any chance have ie installed?
[11:08:04] <Kambfhase> only got IE9
[11:11:40] <IanC> the list is kind of... huge.  so ideally I'd want to load that list into a var and just run over that.  but every time I've tried - it fails. ( http://jsfiddle.net/KxCp6/ if you missed it)
[11:11:49] <kborchers> IanC: not sure but it may not like that your link returns the data with a 301 status code, meaning a redirect. probably wants a 200
[11:12:09] <IanC> I am testing locally
[11:12:15] <Whirl3d> maybe there's a problem here: Anybody?  $("<li class='topicButton'><a href='#"+idName+"'>"+title+"</a></li>");
[11:12:34] <IanC> so since I didn't have it up on a server anywhere, I uploaded it
[11:13:14] <Whirl3d> how do I select all anchors with href attributes only
[11:13:17] <IanC> what I'm afraid is happening is that every time a letter changes, it tries to load the list again... and the list is massive. 27kb
[11:13:40] <IanC> $("a:href")
[11:13:52] <IanC> $("a:href") @Whirl3d
[11:13:54] <kborchers> IanC: it does try to reload every time,  i can see that happening
[11:14:00] <ajpiano> no, $("a[href]") Whirl3d, IanC
[11:14:16] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, no quotes around href?
[11:14:51] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thx, IanC, thx   I had single quotes around href.
[11:15:25] <IanC> ajpiano: really? I use $("input:submit").button(); to make all of the submit buttons use jQuery UI.
[11:15:52] <ajpiano> IanC: there's a difference between pseudoselectors that exist (like :submit) and ones that don't (like :href)
[11:16:09] <IanC> ajpiano: ohhh, interesting. didn't know that. thanks :)
[11:16:53] <IanC> kborchers: can you think of a way to turn that JSON file into a straight up array in JS?
[11:21:11] <IanC> doesn't have to be kborchers, ajpiano? got any input?
[11:21:33] <ajpiano> JSON.parse ?
[11:21:45] <ajpiano> the same way you convert any json into meaningful datastructures?
[11:22:04] <IanC> I used .getJSON
[11:22:15] <IanC> didn't seem to work though, maybe I didn't do it right
[11:22:18] <IanC> I can try again
[11:24:48] <ajpiano> i haven't seen your code, i am presently battling my internet connection
[11:25:33] <jonkristian> Kambfhase: Is there any way to make it fade even though the mouse pointer is already ontop of the element?
[11:25:41] <IanC> updated sample: http://jsfiddle.net/KxCp6/1/
[11:26:15] <jonkristian> If i wrap it in a and listen on that somehow?
[11:28:35] <aKou> Hello,Is it possible to parse a links parameters ,prevent it on click from reloading page and then somehow send the parameters result to refresh a div's content?
[11:29:19] <sadmicrowave> aKou, e.preventDefault() will prevent the link from firing
[11:29:40] <sadmicrowave> and which parameters are you trying to capture? href?
[11:30:00] <IanC> @aKou: might be easier just to make an iFrame and set the target of the link?
[11:30:18] <aKou> http://localhost/testsite/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=42&Itemid=2
[11:30:27] <sadmicrowave> ++IanC
[11:30:33] <aKou> I guess i need to parse everything after index.php
[11:30:47] <Kambfhase> jonkristian: not sure. try googling.
[11:31:06] <sadmicrowave> var myurl = myurl.substring( myurl.indexOf("?") );
[11:31:09] <aKou> I ll keep that in mind and try it out soon
[11:31:20] <sadmicrowave> var myurl = myurl.substring( myurl.indexOf("?")+1 );
[11:32:56] <swiggy> anyone familiar with jQuery UI Draggable/sortable & the way iGooogle uses it? I want my draggable items to have that border 'helper' when you are moving a tab conent around
[11:33:09] <aKou> Thanks sadmicrowave
[11:33:28] <dannytran> not sure if anyone's run into issues getting draggable/droppable to work on iPad, just wrote this script, feedback welcome ... https://github.com/digidanny/iPadDraggable
[11:33:37] <sadmicrowave> aKou,  you want it separated even further though right? down to each variable?
[11:34:16] <swiggy> i want that broken border around the area where u can drag the selected content
[11:34:19] <swiggy> but i can figure it out
[11:34:44] <IanC> (not trying to be annoying) still looking for an assist, need to grab the contents of a JSON file and make it into an array - not working. http://jsfiddle.net/KxCp6/2/
[11:35:55] <aKou> I think not.I was thinking of just getting somehow the parameters and then passing their result to a div
[11:36:08] <dannytran> IanC: http://fs08n1.sendspace.com/dl/90c2a185e7d043a4301f5d6abca936e0/4e0cbb061cc40345/weow5d/texas_cities.json ... isn't returning json, it's redirecting to a login page or something
[11:36:17] <Jayflux> ^^
[11:36:27] <Kambfhase> please paste an example of the JSON
[11:36:51] <IanC> ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
[11:37:21] <Kambfhase> mkay
[11:37:31] <IanC> I'm testing locally - so it's not that exact link in my code, the only reason I had the link there was to share with others.
[11:38:41] <Kambfhase> local with chrome?
[11:39:09] <IanC> I've been bouncing between Opera, Chrome, and Firefox
[11:39:55] <rlweb> hey
[11:40:06] <Kambfhase> hmm. dunno
[11:40:26] <rlweb> need a little help here, just wondering why sendData is not sending the note part  - http://pastie.org/2146173
[11:40:43] <NET||abuse> hi there folks..
[11:40:59] <NET||abuse> i'm trying to do an .each on a selection, but i'm not getting any results.
[11:41:22] <NET||abuse> console.log('test1'); $('.collapsable').each(function(){console.log('test2')}
[11:41:29] <NET||abuse> i don't get test2 back on the log
[11:41:37] <b-lew> Hi there, is there a way to have the first jquery ui tab blank?
[11:41:43] <itsaplanstan> I'm trying to duplicate the drawer effect that twitter has but am unable to figure it out or find a tutorial online for this, does anyone here think they can point me in the right direction?
[11:41:43] <Kambfhase> NET||abuse: did you wait for document ready?
[11:41:46] <NET||abuse> there are 3 .collapsable class <pre> tags in the layout
[11:43:00] <Kambfhase> jeresig created tag 1.6.2 at jquery/jquery 24 minutes ago  << w00t
[11:43:47] <IanC> @b-lew: have you tried &nbsp; in the UL link?
[11:44:25] <b-lew> well i'm doing something kind of funky. mind if I show you?
[11:44:42] <b-lew> yes my first li is blank
[11:44:42] <b-lew> <ul class="ui-tabs-nav">
[11:44:43] <b-lew> 	       			<!--blank slide--><a class="blank" href="#fragment-1"></a><!--blank slide-->
[11:44:46] <NET||abuse> Kambfhase: spotted my mistake, i was calling this sub module's init() from outside the normal document ready block,, thanks :)
[11:44:47] <rlweb> sendData : ({'salt':"n67s",'note':$('#body-frame').contents().find('body').html()})    whats the real way of doing this?
[11:45:02] <b-lew> but I don't think my script is picking it up proberly
[11:45:03] <Kambfhase> :)
[11:45:05] <b-lew> properly
[11:45:11] <sadmicrowave> aKou, :) http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/tZULu/
[11:45:17] <sadmicrowave> gotta love it
[11:45:31] <Kambfhase> rlweb: depends on what you really want to do
[11:45:54] <sadmicrowave> aKou, now opt is an array where you can reference whichever parameter you want
[11:46:06] <b-lew> nm fixed it thanks
[11:46:31] <aKou> Thanks!
[11:46:33] <rlweb> Kambfhase: well send what the html from the body-frame
[11:46:37] <sadmicrowave> yea pretty cool
[11:47:01] <rlweb> Kambfhase: what the html *is
[11:47:17] <Kambfhase> so #body-frame is a iframe?
[11:47:21] <staar2> hello
[11:48:05] <rlweb> yes
[11:48:26] <staar2> what jquery plugin would be good for rating ?
[11:49:06] <Kambfhase> rlweb: did you check if $('#body-frame').contents().find('body').html() correctly returns the html?
[11:49:43] <rlweb> it does, thats what i don't understand
[11:49:47] <b-lew> is there a way to do a mouseout event that defaults and goes to the first tab? http://pastie.org/2146229
[11:50:50] <Kambfhase> rlweb: i assume you error is in PeriodicalUpdater. whatever the heck that is
[11:51:33] <rlweb> haha okay thanks. its periodically sends data over but causeing more problems than it solves.
[11:53:51] <vinmassaro> can anyone tell me how to make this code work with my array? http://jsfiddle.net/e7gpR/
[11:54:17] <vinmassaro> it won't addClass on each item in the array.
[11:55:19] <IanC> shouldn't you use a # instead of a . ???  var hide = $('#corporate');
[11:55:57] <Kambfhase> m(
[11:56:08] <IanC> no, what was I thinking?
[11:56:10] <IanC> I got confused
[11:56:17] <vinmassaro> no, it's adding a class.
[11:56:40] <vinmassaro> I just don't know how to make it apply the class to each item in the array that matches that text
[12:02:05] <IanC> lol I just did a test on my problem, it looks like the callback isn't being made from getJSON.
[12:02:18] <IanC> well thanks for the help - I g2g.
[12:02:31] <lacrymology> is there something which work like 'live' whenever smething that matches is added to the DOM that runs on creation? I want to add a <style> block to an uncreated <iframe>
[12:02:42] <kborchers[A]> vinmassaro: just do hide.addClass('hide');
[12:03:26] <lacrymology> can i do .live('ready', function(){})?
[12:03:37] <kborchers> lacrymology: no, ready is not an event
[12:03:56] <lacrymology> kborchers: it's in the list of events...
[12:04:31] <kborchers> lacrymology: what list?
[12:04:42] <lacrymology> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[12:05:08] <Kambfhase> lacrymology: there is a domcontentedited event, it is not cross-browser though. may be google for something like that
[12:05:28] <kborchers> lacrymology: ready is a method, not an event
[12:05:49] <kborchers> the event would be when the dom is ready, which as Kambfhase said, can only be bound to in some browsers
[12:06:09] <rlweb> anyone know how facebook does the comment increasing time?
[12:06:12] <kborchers> lacrymology: what are you trying to do?
[12:06:39] <ocf> curious - I've got a script tag in my header. There are two functions - GetHospitals() & SetHospital(). GetHospitals is called every time I change my search criteria. When I load the page, I can see the script in Firebug. If I call SetHospital once, my js no longer shows up in firebug, and GetHospitals doesn't fire if I change my search criteria.
[12:06:40] <ocf> Any idea why?
[12:07:05] <oDesk> hello all
[12:07:42] <ocf> I should also point out that GetHospitals works, no problem, as many times as I want to fire it, as long as I don't call SetHospitals
[12:08:03] <Kambfhase> ?p @ ocf
[12:08:03] <bot-t1> ocf, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:08:41] <oDesk> i'm calling $.post() on action which required user login, so when the session expires the design is completely messedup with the login form
[12:09:50] <oDesk> which then being loaded into the div which was expected to load the content with other elements
[12:10:34] <lacrymology> kborchers: I want to add a <style> block to a yet uncreated <iframe>
[12:11:36] <Axcy> Is it possible to have all radio buttons have a specific message when using Jquery validation ?
[12:11:41] <kborchers> lacrymology: and how is the ifram created? can't you just add the style in the same process that creates the iframe?
[12:13:22] <lacrymology> kborchers: it depends on a tool I'm using, I could touch the iframe's css file, but I'd have to do it every time on update..
[12:14:59] <Whirl3d> What's the best way to find an item with the largest value for position().top <0?
[12:15:54] <lacrymology> hm.. apparently jQuery doesn't know how to search inside iframes
[12:16:13] <staar2> what jquery plugin would be good for rating ?
[12:16:21] <lacrymology> $('#iframe') returns an <iframe> object, but $('#iframe html') fails
[12:16:54] <Kambfhase> lacrymology: try $('html', $('#iframe')[0])
[12:17:56] <lacrymology> Kambfhase: nope, that's returning the outer html
[12:18:29] <lacrymology> wait, no. It's returning empty
[12:18:33] <Kambfhase> $('html', $('iframe')[0]) maybe?
[12:18:54] <Kambfhase> not sure about iframe, try googling
[12:21:29] <lacrymology> Kambfhase: done, need to do 'content() on it first
[12:26:24] <janthony> http://pastie.org/2146421 - Any idea why the .each() is telling me that my object is not a function?
[12:28:32] <poindontcare> question , i keep finding myself doing $("selector")[0] to get elements am i doing something wrong are do all jquery methods return arrays
[12:30:48] <ocf> Kambfhase - I can't really fiddle this since it's calling ashx files I can't expose without authentication. But the code is here in case it's something obvious in the js: http://jsfiddle.net/ocf_/E3knL/
[12:30:58] <ocf> I dropped in all the js & html
[12:31:24] <kborchers> poindontcare: that is not technically wrong, though it all depends on what you are doing with the element. if you throw out some examples of the way you use it, we can tell you if that's right or if there is a better way.
[12:32:39] <poindontcare> setting inner html of container $('container')[0].innerHTML = "Moo"
[12:32:53] <poindontcare>  $('#container')[0].innerHTML = "Moo"
[12:33:04] <kborchers> poindontcare: you could do that better with $('container').html('Moo');
[12:33:23] <poindontcare> ah thats much better thanks
[12:33:35] <janthony> How would I add items to an object? var validationErrors = {}; validationErrors[] = 'The Name Field Cannot be Left Blank'; gives me a syntax error in console
[12:33:42] <kborchers> obviously with the # you added later ;)
[12:33:50] <poindontcare> kborchers: is this acomplished done by deceratign arrays  ?
[12:33:55] <poindontcare> *decorating
[12:34:54] <kborchers> poindontcare: not sure what you mean
[12:35:24] <poindontcare> does jquery add these methods to the array object returned by the selector ?
[12:35:51] <janthony> Anyone?
[12:36:20] <systemfault> janthony: You want an array or an associative array this time?
[12:36:45] <janthony> systemfault: well, I tried doing .each() with the method we tried and it didn't work, then tried doing a for, and that didn't work either.
[12:36:58] <systemfault> .each is for arrays
[12:37:03] <janthony> systemfault: Other words, can't figure out how to loop through it :P
[12:37:14] <kborchers> poindontcare: i'm not exactly sure of all of the inner workings of jQuery but I know at its most basic, a jQuery object is an array but I don't think they are adding methods to the array object. the jQuery object is it's own entity the way i understand it. if that makes any sense ;)
[12:37:19] <systemfault> janthony: var validationErrors = []; validationErrors.push('ZOMG!!!!! It failed!');
[12:37:35] <janthony> systemfault: ahh, ok, thanks again!
[12:37:39] <poindontcare> interezting
[12:38:19] <systemfault> ?eval var validationErrors = []; validationErrors.push('ZOMG!!!!! It failed!'); $.each(validationErrors, function(i, elem) { console.log(elem); });
[12:38:19] <bot-t1> systemfault: "ZOMG!!!!! It failed!"["ZOMG!!!!! It failed!"]
[12:39:08] <Mobbbb> Hey, can anyone here tell me how to convert 3 varibles into d,m,y
[12:39:42] <kborchers> poindontcare: one other point on my example above, when you do $("#container").html("Moo"); that container's html is set to Moo, if you were to do $(".container").html("Moo"); and there were multiple elements with the class of container, they would all have their html set to Moo
[12:41:18] <janthony> systemfault: wow, that was much easier to work with and was exactly what I wanted. thanks!
[12:41:57] <poindontcare> yeah , kborchers seems like a consequence using lisps as internal object
[12:42:52] <Mobbbb> can anyone hep me?
[12:43:06] <kborchers> Mobbbb: gonna need a little more information than that. see ?demo
[12:43:06] <bot-t1> Mobbbb, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:43:36] <mikeycgto> would $(window).load() be triggered after all my $(document).ready() handlers have finished executing?
[12:43:39] <Mobbbb> well.. i just wanna know how to covnert $month $day $year into m-d-Y format
[12:43:52] <systemfault> mikeycgto: Normally, yes.
[12:44:25] <janthony> systemfault: So why can't I do validationErrors.each(function() { console.log($(this)); }); instead of $.each(validationErrors, function(i, elem) { console.log(elem); }); ?
[12:44:33] <mikeycgto> when would it not? (i could see if my ready handler did a timeout\interval, but i wouldn't consider that part of the handlers code anyway)
[12:45:06] <kborchers> Mobbbb: var mdy = $month+"-"+$day+"-"+$year;
[12:45:32] <systemfault> janthony: Because there's no .each on an array... There is .forEach but it can't be used on older browsers
[12:45:50] <janthony> systemfault: I see.
[12:45:52] <systemfault> janthony: That's why $.each(myArray, function(index, elem) {}); exists
[12:46:19] <systemfault> janthony: Javascript is way nicer to use on the server than in a browser :(
[12:46:30] <NET||abuse> hmm, i'm doing a toggle('slow') on a <pre> in a div, i'm getting glitchy end to the animation
[12:46:55] <NET||abuse> i have a float'd right toggle button to show/hide the content of the <pre> ..
[12:46:58] <sadmicrowave> is there a way to utilize the [] notation in the selector to find an element with two attribute conditions? like so: $("foo[attr1='true'][attr2='false']").size()
[12:47:06] <poindontcare> systemfault: how are you using js in the server ?
[12:47:11] <Mobbbb> thanks kborchers any ideas about in php ?
[12:47:36] <Kambfhase> sadmicrowave: thatsnthe way to do it
[12:47:36] <systemfault> poindontcare: node.js
[12:47:41] <kborchers> Mobbbb try asking in ##php.
[12:47:52] <Mobbbb> i cant get in
[12:47:58] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Yes, it works fine
[12:48:02] <sadmicrowave> Kambfhase, I was afraid you were going to say that...then my problem is somewhere else...
[12:48:13] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: I would switch the " and the ' though
[12:48:14] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:48:19] <sadmicrowave> no T_T
[12:49:01] <systemfault> What...
[12:49:05] <NET||abuse> so the html looks like <div><a href="#" class="collapse_toggle floatright">info toggle</a><pre class="hidden">...load of content</pre></div>    so the pre is display none, and teh anchor is float right, as the pre shows, the anchor slides right as the side of the dig gows, but i get a weird glitch
[12:49:09] <kborchers> ?g php dateformat @ Mobbbb
[12:49:10] <bot-t1> Mobbbb, PHP: date - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php
[12:49:16] <sadmicrowave> systemfault, what what?
[12:49:34] <systemfault> sadmicrowave: Your selector is valid...
[12:49:40] <sadmicrowave> thanks
[12:49:53] <sadmicrowave> you are valid
[12:49:58] <systemfault> I try to.
[12:50:01] <sadmicrowave> :P
[12:50:16] <atxq> having issues with $("body").css("background-color","#0099ff"); doesn't work. how can I fix this?
[12:50:33] <systemfault> atxq: Give us a testcase :(
[12:50:42] <dp> I have a div that I've manually set the height on. is there a way to have jquery set the height (on click) based on the height of the content inside it? it's mostly just text with some br's
[12:50:46] <systemfault> atxq: It's difficult for us to guess :(
[12:50:59] <sadmicrowave> dont use 'background-color' use $("body").css('background', "#0099ff");
[12:51:14] <atxq> just background?
[12:51:18] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[12:51:39] <sadmicrowave> background can be used for url's or color's css knows the difference
[12:51:43] <atxq> let me test it
[12:51:55] <sadmicrowave> sorry (grammar lesson) those arn't supposed to be possessive
[12:52:09] <systemfault> atxq: http://jsfiddle.net/vURYB/
[12:52:19] <systemfault> atxq: See.. it works fine there.
[12:52:45] <sadmicrowave> and what a fine looking color it is
[12:52:48] <sadmicrowave> :)
[12:53:12] <jedimind> can anyone show me a quick and efficient way to do a looping timer?
[12:53:13] <sadmicrowave> no really, thats a nice looking blue
[12:53:20] <sadmicrowave> jedimindtricks?
[12:53:25] <atxq> yeah, its working the example, but I cannot get it to work elsewhere
[12:53:41] <atxq> on my page it does not change the background-color
[12:53:45] <jedimind> jedimindtricks are amazeballs
[12:53:47] <systemfault> jedimind: setInterval?
[12:53:51] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[12:53:56] <atxq> I even paste it at the top of my jquery function
[12:54:04] <atxq> strange, right?
[12:54:16] <sadmicrowave> atxq, perhaps you have something overriding the color later down in your code...
[12:54:24] <SEJeff> When using $.getJSON(url, {}, function(data) {...}), data is populated to essentially the evaled version of jqXHR.responseText
[12:54:57] <sadmicrowave> orl, the order of your link references in your html is wrong. i.e. you have your javascript function link before your css link and your css sets body to white
[12:54:57] <SEJeff> When using $.ajax, how do you get the evaluated data returned from the request? Is eval(jqXHR.responseText) the best way or something like that?
[12:55:04] <jedimind> can you trigger an existing click event with setInterval without having to create another wrapper function?
[12:55:12] <atxq> no, not overriding it. this is the only change I am calling for the background-color or anything on the page
[12:55:20] <atxq> and its the last code on the page too
[12:55:50] <atxq> something so simple just doesn't want to work on my page...
[12:56:04] <sadmicrowave> jedimind, I'm not sure what you mean by "trigger an existing click event". you want the setInterval loop to execute the click function?
[12:56:06] <systemfault> jedimind: Target the element then call .click() on it without handler, it will trigger it.
[12:56:35] <orl> sadmicrowave: er, are you talking about what I've been sending this early afternoon (it's 10 PM here)
[12:56:41] <sadmicrowave> ++systemfault
[12:56:53] <jedimind> basically i have an existing carousel/slider i wrote and i wanted to just trigger the already existing click event binded to .next on repeat
[12:56:54] <jedimind> but yeah
[12:57:00] <jedimind> it works, i just asked before trying
[12:57:02] <jedimind> cardinal sin
[12:57:07] <sadmicrowave> orl, what are YOU talking about?
[12:57:14] <sadmicrowave> lol
[12:57:19] <orl> sadmicrowave: you just ping me a few lines before
[12:57:22] <sadmicrowave> jedimind,  boo
[12:57:27] <kborchers> SEJeff: the success handler in .ajax() is defined as success(data, textStatus, jqXHR) so data is immediately available
[12:57:46] <SEJeff> kborchers, Oh I was doing that totally wrong. Thanks
[12:57:52] <sadmicrowave> orl,  my bad, I was typing 'or,' and xchat thought something else
[12:58:04] <orl> sadmicrowave: oh OK... no worry
[12:58:11] <sadmicrowave> stupid xchat
[12:58:19] <orl> for sure, just use irssi
[12:58:49] <SEJeff> kborchers, I'm trying to do this from the complete handler. Thats the issue
[12:58:51] <SEJeff> Thanks
[12:59:16] <pootpoot> whats the best method for replacing the inside of a div with a block of html (objects for flash)
[12:59:18] <elux> hey guys .
[12:59:28] <pootpoot> would i do .html() and turn the inside to a string?
[12:59:34] <devinrolsen> ok, i'm a litte confused. When ever I fire off a $.post() I see that indeed the post happends and it returns the page data like I want.. but then there seems to be a get request that always follow after the post that screws up the returned data I wanted from my orignal post request.
[12:59:34] <kborchers> SEJeff: yeah, complete is only something you want to do even if the request results in an error. it fires either way
[12:59:41] <elux> how can i convert a json object (simple one) to a string..? ie.. { event: "hi" } to "{ event: \"hi\" }"
[12:59:45] <atxq> systemfault, thanks. the problem was that I had a div tag covering the body tag
[12:59:47] <SEJeff> kborchers, I've got a case statement in the complete handler to do stuff
[12:59:54] <devinrolsen> is it normal jquery behavior to fire off a get directly after a $.ajax or $.post?
[12:59:56] <systemfault> atxq: Ah! :P
[13:00:02] <kborchers> ?parseJSON @ elux
[13:00:02] <bot-t1> elux, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[13:00:15] <kborchers> sorry, wrong way
[13:00:31] <elux> yea..
[13:00:43] <elux> i want to send a json object over the wire .. in json :P

[13:02:18] <Rushing> anyone have an issue with IE9 where the page view doesn't update? the URL changes, Developer Tools shows the new page HTML, but the visible area just doesn't change, and nothing is clickable in it
[13:03:40] <kborchers> Rushing: the issue is ... IE9 ;)  Unfortunately no, I have not seen that
[13:04:08] <systemfault> Rushing: Do you use the latest version of jQuery?
[13:04:13] <systemfault> Might be just that.
[13:04:30] <b-lew> Is there a way to do a mouseout or leave on this function? http://pastie.org/2146229
[13:04:42] <elux> JSON.stringify
[13:04:43] <elux> done deal
[13:05:11] <Rushing> systemfault, it's not really related to jquery
[13:05:26] <Rushing> i just know we all have to debug in IE9 a bit so i didn't know if anyone else had seen this issue
[13:05:26] <systemfault> Ahhh, then sorry, no, I never had that problem
[13:06:03] <systemfault> elux: Be careful with that if you must support older browsers.
[13:06:14] <elux> yea .. i know, this is just for a test client written in js
[13:07:29] <pootpoot> why am i getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <" when i add html with jQuery.html() :(
[13:07:39] <pootpoot> its the start of the first <object> tag
[13:08:02] <kborchers> b-lew: what are you trying to accomplish with your mouseout
[13:08:29] <pootpoot> i feel like i have to add the html line by line?
[13:08:49] <b-lew> I want the mouseout to go to the default tab
[13:09:24] <b-lew> kborchers: which would be tab one. when you first refresh the page it defaults to that tab
[13:09:27] <b-lew> if that makes sense
[13:09:36] <Krambfhase> ?p @ pootpoot
[13:09:37] <bot-t1> pootpoot, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:09:45] <zalun> hi again
[13:10:00] <zalun> please tell me which versions of jQuery should I take down from the drop down
[13:10:07] <zalun> in jsfiddle
[13:10:16] <ajpiano> zalun: 1 sec
[13:10:51] <pootpoot> Krambfhase: http://jsbin.com/ovevuv
[13:10:52] <pootpoot> thanks
[13:11:02] <ajpiano> zalun: once 1.6.2 is up on the google cdn, replace 1.6.1. with 1.6.2
[13:11:05] <ajpiano> that would seem to be the only change
[13:11:10] <pootpoot> it says im not closing the ending ' but in that case i feel like i have to escape certain characters?
[13:11:19] <zalun> ajpiano: it's done already
[13:12:00] <Krambfhase> pootpoot: strings end on linebreak.
[13:12:08] <pootpoot> lol since when
[13:12:12] <pootpoot> ok that makes sense
[13:12:14] <ajpiano> zalun: not showing up for me yet
[13:12:15] <Krambfhase> since, ... ever
[13:12:28] <zalun> ajpiano: aaah - sorry - weird
[13:12:34] <pootpoot> so would i .......... '<object>' + '<other stuff>'
[13:12:44] <ajpiano> don't worry... i also just saw that 1.6.2 isn't up on goog yet so
[13:13:13] <kborchers> b-lew: have you tried just doing it after you create your tabs in a separate call like $("#featured").mouseout(function() {...}); might be something screwy with the object returned after the call to tabs
[13:13:22] <Krambfhase> pootpoot: yeah
[13:13:34] <zalun> I added 1.6.1 today :)
[13:13:46] <b-lew> I tried a couple of things, I'm just guessing at this point though since I'm no jquery expert
[13:13:49] <b-lew> let me try that
[13:13:53] <b-lew> Thanks kborchers
[13:14:02] <timmywil> thanks zalun!
[13:14:03] <kborchers> np, let me know if that works
[13:14:27] <ravenzz> zalun can i ask you, what's the matter?
[13:14:46] <b-lew> how would I get the function to look for the first li?
[13:15:37] <systemfault> b-lew: $('ul > li:first-child')
[13:15:40] <zalun> I just want to slim the libraries list a little
[13:16:06] <ravenzz> oh k
[13:16:19] <ravenzz> then remove the jquery one if you don't need it :p
[13:16:36] <b-lew> does this look right then? I think I have something wrong in my syntax
[13:16:36] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/2146638
[13:17:00] <ravenzz> otherwise your help request is off-topic?
[13:17:04] <systemfault> b-lew: I'm not a magician.
[13:17:16] <b-lew> hummm
[13:17:20] <b-lew> haha
[13:17:24] <Krambfhase> b-lew: line 7 is wrong
[13:17:24] <kborchers> b-lew: just do $("#featured").tabs("select", 0); in your function. also, i would probably change that to mouseleave, it is most likely what you want
[13:17:25] <b-lew> i must have done something
[13:17:31] <timmywil> zalun: I agree with ajpiano
[13:18:31] <zalun> I can't see the 1.6.2 on google API
[13:18:32] <kborchers> b-lew: and also, don't use the comma, do that outside of the tabs call altogether
[13:19:04] <timmywil> zalun: sometimes it takes those google guys a while
[13:19:17] <zalun> ok
[13:19:31] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/ts/ hawt or not ?
[13:19:38] <kborchers> b-lew: try this http://jsfiddle.net/UE2dB/
[13:19:40] <jedimind> the slider more than anything
[13:19:46] <b-lew> syntax kills me
[13:19:52] <zalun> so, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and edge are needed?
[13:20:03] <zalun> I don't believe so
[13:20:25] <ravenzz> :?
[13:20:34] <ravenzz> just include the last version
[13:20:36] <ravenzz> 1.6.1
[13:20:57] <ravenzz> if you are going to use the google CDN hosted one
[13:20:57] <b-lew> Thanks kborchers and krambfhase that worked!
[13:21:08] <kborchers> cool
[13:21:14] <timmywil> zalun: if it has to be shortened, I think 1.2.6, 1.4.4, 1.6.2, edge
[13:21:32] <timmywil> but I like the list as it is
[13:21:33] <Krambfhase> 1.3.2 is common amongst drupal users
[13:21:56] <zalun> there is no "must" just asking if it's needed there
[13:22:25] <Isis___> hello everybody, im in trouble with a fancybox and a datepicker, it yells "f is undefined" from the jquery ui, I updated everyting just in case and it is not working either. Any ideas what it might be?
[13:22:51] <ravenzz> ?p @ Isis___
[13:22:51] <bot-t1> Isis___, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:23:03] <Isis___> thanks
[13:23:20] <ravenzz> Isis___ http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:23:56] <orngchkn_> Can someone confirm this: Given an $element that has an 'auto' width of 200px and has its width set via css to 100px, when I do $element.css({width:'auto'}).width() 100 is incorrectly returned. It should return 200.
[13:24:19] <orngchkn_> If I instead do $element.css({width:'auto'}) then wait some small amount of time and do $element.width(), I get 200.
[13:25:53] <Krambfhase> orngchkn_: maybe try for refresh/redraw before getting the value
[13:26:57] <ravenzz> maybe they (css() and width()) are going to be executed in an asynchronous way
[13:27:08] <ravenzz> but i am not sure about that
[13:27:34] <orngchkn_> Krambfhase: Is there a specific time to wait for that?
[13:27:40] <orngchkn_> Or a method to force it (I doubt it)
[13:29:28] <Krambfhase> you can force flushing the render queue by touching scrollTop according to ncz
[13:30:19] <devinrolsen> I got a weird instance where a submit event keeps building up on forms I'm pulling in via ajax. Is there a way to only allow one event (submit in my case) on these forms at any given time?
[13:30:46] <orngchkn_> Krambfhase: So just chain a call to scrollTop() before calling width()?
[13:31:03] <orngchkn_> (Nope... just tried)
[13:31:26] <ravenzz> orngchkn_ http://jsfiddle.net/aLhJa/
[13:34:23] <BillCriswell> I'm using a jQuery UI slider and I have hidden inputs associated with each slider so I can just run an serializeArray() and access that information quicker. Is there a way to trigger the "slide" event as soon as the script runs to it updates the inputs for me?
[13:34:54] <BillCriswell> $slider.slider( "value", 25 ) didn't. I thought it would.
[13:35:46] <djQuery> ?demo@ BillCriswell
[13:35:47] <bot-t1> BillCriswell, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:36:16] <orngchkn_> ravenzz, Krambfhase: Ah, my CSS3 transitions are probably causing the behavior I'm seeing.
[13:36:21] <kborchers> BillCriswell: do your sliders have more than one handle?
[13:36:24] <orngchkn_> Thanks for the prod in the right direction
[13:36:27] <djQuery> BillCriswell: think you need .slider({value: 24});
[13:36:35] <BillCriswell> kborchers: Just one.
[13:36:55] <ravenzz> hey djQuery hellO, sup
[13:37:20] <kborchers> BillCriswell: hmmm, then I would have said what you already tried. i would say we need to see it then
[13:37:49] <djQuery> ravenzz: just trying to grok jsviews
[13:38:51] <djQuery> BillCriswell: when setting the options you need to use .slider('option', 'value', 37)  unless you are setting them on init then its like I said before
[13:38:54] <b-lew> can you slide right in jquery ui?
[13:40:07] <djQuery> b-lew: you mean like this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#rangemax
[13:40:17] <ravenzz> oh nice
[13:40:50] <djQuery> ravenzz: http://jsbin.com/uxenub/31/edit
[13:41:31] <b-lew> djQuery: I want the content on the right to slide in from the left http://turnpost.com/clients/CSP/index.html -> does that make sense?
[13:41:38] <BillCriswell> djQuery: That seems to be the sale as $('#slider').slider( "value", 1000 ); it doesn't trigger the event but when I run $('#slider').slider("value") to value is right.
[13:41:47] <BillCriswell> seems to be the same as*
[13:41:48] <Isis___> as for my last question, im using jsfriddle, but as a novice on that I cant reproduce the error not even load the datepicker http://jsfiddle.net/8RaZG/light/
[13:41:51] <kborchers> djQuery: the doc lists value and values methods for slider so he doesn't have to use option
[13:42:12] <Isis___> very nice tool btw
[13:42:25] <djQuery> kborchers: hadn't noticed that
[13:42:30] <ravenzz> Isis___ from the left sidebar.. you can add the libraries (Add Resources)
[13:42:33] <kborchers> BillCriswell: so you are updating those fields with the change event handler right?
[13:43:00] <ravenzz> Isis___ http://code.google.com/intl/it/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[13:43:05] <BillCriswell> kborchers: Yes, with "slide".
[13:43:17] <BillCriswell> I didn't see change. I'll try that.
[13:43:17] <kborchers> BillCriswell: move that code to an external function, then you can call it in the create handler
[13:44:03] <BillCriswell> kborchers: The change method did what I wanted. Thanks a lot man.
[13:44:08] <ravenzz> Isis___ anyway you should take a look at fixingthesejquery.com and learn how to debug and blabla, it will help you in figure out how to solve your issues
[13:44:11] <kborchers> BillCriswell: cool
[13:44:31] <ravenzz> bbl
[13:45:36] <KWhat_Work> is there no .hide() fade effect???
[13:46:08] <Woet> KWhat_Work: .fadeOut ?
[13:46:20] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[13:46:21] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: sure there is. .hide('slow');
[13:46:24] <djQuery> ?hide
[13:46:24] <bot-t1> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[13:46:44] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: .hide( [duration,] [easing,] [callback] )
[13:46:54] <KWhat_Work> yah, strange that .fadeout is avaiable with hide
[13:47:04] <savid> I've noticed that  $(document).ready()  seems to fire before images are loaded.  Is there an event I can hook into that'll fire after images are loaded?
[13:47:08] <KWhat_Work> cant do .hide('fade'
[13:47:18] <Woet> KWhat_Work: [22:46:21] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: sure there is. .hide('slow');
[13:47:47] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: .hide('slow', 'fade')
[13:48:00] <KWhat_Work> djQuery: does that work?  Its not listed
[13:48:48] <Woet> KWhat_Work: it's listed in the docs at http://api.jquery.com/hide/ - durationA string or number determining how long the animation will run.
[13:48:49] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: not familar with what all the easing names are and no I havent tested it
[13:49:29] <BillCriswell> kborchers: Weird, when I update it on "create" ui.value is empty even with a value option set.
[13:49:37] <djQuery> KWhat_Work: The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, calledswing, and one that progresses at a constant pace, calledlinear.
[13:49:52] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/2146784 -> does this look right djQuery?
[13:52:11] <kborchers> BillCriswell: that is weird. now that you're using change though, you should be able to keep your change code in change, and just set the value to 0 or what ever works for your situation in crate using "value" and it should fire the change event for you.
[13:52:25] <kborchers> create*
[13:53:49] <BillCriswell> kborchers: Definitely.
[13:55:38] <philosophia> http://pastebin.com/NT5tggBt i need some help.  i'm trying to assign a variable from the results of a jquery function
[13:55:39] <djQuery> b-lew: yes but that would trigger while they are sliding right? wouldnt be better to trigger on stop since you are just manipulating hidden fields?
[13:55:55] <djQuery> or am I gettin confused as to who is doing what with slider
[13:55:57] <philosophia> http://pastebin.com/NT5tggBt it is not populating my form element based on the results of the jquery function
[13:56:07] <philosophia> any ideas?  is this a scoping problem?
[13:56:34] <b-lew> djQuery I'm doing the slide, I want the right fade in content when you hover over the left nav to slide instead of fade http://turnpost.com/clients/CSP/index.html
[13:56:47] <poindontcare> is ther any way to add a listener for waiting for an element to become available ?
[13:57:11] <djQuery> philosophia: doesnt htis require an integer? .elements["callback_form_clairvistaLiveexpert.ipAddress"]
[13:57:17] <smali> anyone here using jQuery UI MultiSelect Widget i got problem getting it to load when loading it in a modal dialog
[13:57:28] <kborchers> poindontcare: what do you mean by "become available"?
[13:57:31] <philosophia> djquery that's a string in the business object
[13:57:40] <poindontcare> kborchers: become appended to the dom
[13:58:04] <kborchers> you may want to see ?live
[13:58:04] <bot-t1> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:58:05] <poindontcare> i am adding a Quick time object to the dom need call he play method when it gets added
[13:58:28] <poindontcare> kborchers: perfect
[13:58:29] <djQuery> poindontcare: can you select it with a jquery statement instead? have you tried console.log to see what the value of it is?
[13:58:50] <poindontcare> it is null , since it takes time to load
[13:59:24] <kborchers> poindontcare: that's only for binding an event once it's in the dom though, if you are trying to actually do something when it's appended, live won't work
[14:00:02] <kborchers> poindontcare: are you loading content via ajax or something?
[14:00:03] <poindontcare> its a video in a popup , i set the popups html to be the Qt object
[14:00:13] <Whirl3d> if you are using .next to iterate through a list and you get to the last item, what does it return? And empty set?
[14:00:14] <poindontcare> then i need to call play on it
[14:00:46] <philosophia> http://pastebin.com/NT5tggBt - i'm having problems.  i'm trying to set a var equal to the results of a jquery function.  then populate a form element with this value.  it looks like there's a scoping?  problem.  the form element is being populated with 'unknown' and not the value from the jquery function
[14:00:55] <kborchers> poindontcare: so is the object being written in by your code or pulled in via ajax?
[14:01:07] <poindontcare> written in the code
[14:02:16] <poindontcare> the formatting is wrong but http://pastebin.com/qdLekf63
[14:02:57] <kborchers> poindontcare: ok, and how do you "call play"?
[14:03:12] <poindontcare> document.qt_player.Play()
[14:03:32] <poindontcare> unfortunateley document.qt_player is not available
[14:05:50] <kborchers> poindontcare: is this an actual popup or a div or something in the page that you are "popping up"
[14:05:59] <poindontcare> its a popup
[14:06:07] <poindontcare> using simple dialog
[14:06:18] <poindontcare> oh not a window popup
[14:07:28] <kborchers> poindontcare: can you just have the qt object in the dialog when the page loads, just hidden. that should then give you access to document.qt_player.Play() i would think.
[14:07:44] <kborchers> then just show() the video
[14:08:34] <poindontcare> yeah unfortunately the dialog removes all its contents , i guess i should have it hidden some where else then pluck it and append it into the dialog
[14:09:10] <kborchers> poindontcare: yeah, i would try that
[14:09:29] <KWhat_Work> is there some reason i wouldnt be able to call a fadeIn from a fadeOut callback?
[14:09:35] <poindontcare> k lets see that
[14:11:02] <b-lew> is there a way to get the content on the right (will show up if you hover on the left nav) to slide in from the left? http://turnpost.com/clients/CSP/index.html
[14:11:53] <kborchers> KWhat_Work: are you actually using the callback or just chaining them? you need to do something like $("#element").fadout("slow", function() {
[14:12:05] <KWhat_Work> yah its the callback
[14:12:10] <KWhat_Work> for some reason its not fading in
[14:12:17] <kborchers> hmmm
[14:14:04] <Sieben> Hi everyone
[14:14:46] <Sieben> I would like to know if it's possible to do an accordion who is draggable ?
[14:14:52] <KWhat_Work> http://pastebin.com/P3D3fm3a
[14:15:01] <KWhat_Work> kborchers: ^^
[14:15:29] <djQuery> Sieben: drag the whole accordion or reorg the items in the accrod?
[14:15:56] <KWhat_Work> kborchers: never mind im retarded
[14:16:46] <sadmicrowave> need help with javascript's 'in' operator.  if( !( iBarCode in BarCodeArray ) ) is not working.... am I doing it right?
[14:17:07] <snover> I dont know. are you?
[14:17:16] <djQuery> Sieben: to drag the whole accord I sugges wrapping it in somethign else. and hopefuly that something else will have a drag handle somewhere.   /div>
[14:17:23] <sadmicrowave> snover, thats what I'm asking
[14:17:38] <snover> sadmicrowave: since you havent said what exactly it is you are trying to do, its impossible for anyone here to say
[14:17:39] <snover> :)
[14:18:09] <sadmicrowave> no actually I just want to know why the if statement doesn't work. I don't need to include the rest of the function to figure out why I can't get into the if
[14:18:20] <Sieben> djQuery, the whole accordion
[14:18:21] <snover> ?xy problem @ sadmicrowave
[14:18:22] <bot-t1> sadmicrowave, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[14:18:35] <KWhat_Work> sadmicrowave: well i dont think  iBarCode in BarCodeArray is valid syntax
[14:18:42] <smali> can someone please tell me why http://pastebin.com/SCJvH9Uw works if i open the .php directly but not if i load it in a nyroModal popup?
[14:18:45] <snover> the syntax is fine
[14:18:46] <Sieben> djQuery, I tried to make a draggable
[14:18:54] <Sieben> and put inside a accordion
[14:18:57] <snover> depending upon what exactly is trying to be done
[14:19:01] <snover> which we dont know
[14:19:04] <Sieben> but each time I try to move it
[14:19:12] <KWhat_Work> smali: wtf is a nyroModal popup
[14:19:15] <Sieben> I activate the accordion
[14:19:34] <sadmicrowave> snover, I'm not asking if there is a better way to do it, I'm asking if the syntax I'm using is correct
[14:19:40] <snover> MAYBE.
[14:19:45] <worm_> Hi everyone. Maybe this is not jquery. But since I found alot of excellent people here, then I ask.
[14:19:45] <djQuery> Sieben: the key will be giving the dragable a handle somewhere
[14:19:50] <sadmicrowave> holy shit forget it
[14:20:00] <smali> http://nyromodal.nyrodev.com/
[14:20:01] <KWhat_Work> smali: is that what your loadin in there ?
[14:20:03] <worm_> if I want to enable/disable a text field, upon the user clicking a radio button
[14:20:10] <worm_> should I use class in HTML ?
[14:20:22] <smali> just some companies
[14:20:29] <smali> it works perfectly if i open the php
[14:20:33] <djQuery> ?demo@ Sieben
[14:20:34] <bot-t1> Sieben, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:20:36] <KWhat_Work> smali: just by looking at it is because its got html and body tags
[14:20:50] <b-lew> can I score some help?
[14:20:56] <KWhat_Work> smali: as far as i know that popup box is not using an iframe
[14:21:20] <smali> which means? i got other forms to load in the popup just fine
[14:21:20] <BillCriswell> worm_: You can just disable the input element. http://www.htmldog.com/reference/htmltags/input/
[14:21:53] <KWhat_Work> smali: take out everything above and below the php tags
[14:22:55] <worm_> BillCriswell: I know that. The thing is, I'd like to make as less JS code as possible, to disable/enable some input text fields, when the user clicks some radio buttons
[14:23:24] <worm_> Imagine I have 100 pages, each page has some inter dependancy between radiobuttons and text input
[14:23:44] <smali> oh yeah i forget to add that it loads the select just fine but when i activate the jquery part of it that doesn't work sorry its late
[14:23:50] <worm_> I wonder if that's elegant to write a generic JS function to handle the class of radio buttons
[14:24:26] <djQuery> worm_: then have someway of defining which inputs are disabled either through a nameing convention of both or through some data-disableinputs="[]" of the checkbox
[14:25:06] <smali> $(document).ready(function(){ if i add that to use the jquery multiselect plugin then it doesn't load the popup anymore
[14:25:28] <worm_> djQuery: is "data-disableinputs" a property of something ?
[14:29:54] <worm_> djQuery: imagine at page N I have 5 radiogroups 1,2,3,4,5. Group 1 has button 1.1 to disable text input 1.1, button 2.2 to disable text input 1.2, ... group 5 has button 5.1 to disable text input 5.1 .... and so on to
[14:30:52] <worm_> I don't know how many page I would have, and at each page how many radiogroups and how many input text fields to be disabled/enabled
[14:33:16] <smali> KWhat_Work it got it to work now thanks i had to add the multiselect.js to the php file from which i'm calling the popup
[14:35:06] <b-lew> can anyone help me out with a small feature i'm confused about but am half way there on?
[14:39:20] <elrise> Hi guys
[14:39:38] <elrise> can anyone recommend me visualization libraries such as d3.js ?
[14:41:59] <Aristata> Is it posible to assign hover css to a jquery element?
[14:42:21] <Aristata> $('a:hover').css('cursor', 'hand');
[14:42:23] <Aristata> Like that?
[14:42:53] <Soothsayer> Aristata, seems right to me.
[14:43:01] <Aristata> hrm
[14:43:05] <Aristata> That's what I thought too.
[14:43:47] <Soothsayer> elrise, still around ?
[14:43:57] <elrise> yup
[14:44:02] <ravenzz> $('a').hover(function() { $(this).css('cursor','hand') });  :?
[14:44:03] <Soothsayer> Aristata, have you wrapped it within a $(document).ready(... ) ?
[14:44:11] <djQuery> worm_: well seeing as I have no idea how you are generating your pages or even what they are being used for I dont think I can provide more insight
[14:44:50] <Soothsayer> elrise, http://www.omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/
[14:45:08] <ravenzz> Aristata $('a').hover(function() { $(this).css('cursor','hand') });
[14:45:09] <Soothsayer> elrise, but I think you are looking for something like this - http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/
[14:45:21] <elrise> yup
[14:45:23] <Soothsayer> oh, I just read that it's now becoming D3
[14:45:33] <elrise> exactly hehe
[14:45:40] <elrise> I was just looking at that one
[14:45:42] <Aristata> ravenzz:  Thanks!
[14:46:02] <Soothsayer> elrise, that's definitely your only choice
[14:46:11] <Soothsayer> there are not many people building a 4 mb javascript library :-P
[14:46:37] * djQuery still failing to grok jsviews
[14:46:48] <ravenzz> gh
[14:46:53] <elrise> Soothsayer: Awesome, looks really nice
[15:22:16] <Sieben> :q
[15:27:55] <phelixx> I am using this jquery script called imageflow. Its located here. http://www.indepthsolutions/us/theteam Does anyone know if its possible to increase the height of that bottom area so that I can add more text? And also how I can go about aligning that text to the left instead of the center?
[15:42:15] <supsup> anyone ever see this issue:  you submit a file to server in IE7...and it sends the whole path as the filename?
[15:42:42] <coreyo> Quick Question, I'm trying to find an html element where class="foo" and attribute bar="fubar".   .find('.foo[bar="fubar"]')  does not seem to be doing the job.
[15:46:29] <supsup> seems to work to me
[15:51:08] <supsup> coreyo: http://jsfiddle.net/mWAAb/
[15:55:22] <devnill> is anyone familiar with Defer?
[15:56:31] <devinrolsen> I love how well the jquery validation fails to work with forms being pulled in via any get or post request.
[15:57:19] <devnill> I'm trying to make a function which returns the value of a cookie but I cant get the callback to fire before the function is finished running. I read on stack overflow that defer doesn't wait for callbacks to fire but I cant think of any other clean way to do it
[15:59:11] <coreyo> supsup, http://jsfiddle.net/mWAAb/5/  check that example
[16:01:19] <supsup> you append to a selector
[16:01:30] <supsup> what are u appending to?
[16:01:43] <supsup> are you trying to change the bar value?
[16:03:08] <coreyo> supsup, whoops!  sorry about that, you are right  I forgot to remove the .find
[16:03:45] <supsup> even without the find your append would make no sense
[16:04:58] <coreyo> supsup, I'm not sure that I follow.  if I remove .find, it will just turn "Foo" into "Foo Bar"
[16:05:51] <supsup> perhaps i thought append required a selector not a variable value.
[16:06:30] <devnill> ^
[16:07:02] <coreyo> as I understand it $('.foo[bar="fubar"]') will return a set of all matching elements, and .append() after it will append to all of those elements.
[16:07:20] <coreyo> there's a hidden .each() assumed
[16:08:09] <supsup> cool never used it like that
[16:08:37] <coreyo> supsup, at any rate, if that simple example is indeed working, there must be a much more complex bug in my code in the original element constructors
[16:08:43] <coreyo> supsup, thanks
[16:09:35] <unclemantis> I am getting the following error but everything looks and works just fine. Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dispatchEvent'
[16:09:36] <supsup> yah np.  funny i've never used append that way looked it up in api. a lways usedd it to attach to existiing dom elements
[16:09:58] <unclemantis> that error is happening on prototype.js line 5653
[16:10:03] <unclemantis> using the latest stable
[16:10:12] <supsup> this is jquery channel bra
[16:10:31] <supsup> use jQuery.noConflict() and use jQuery instead of $
[16:10:41] <supsup> tho better yet choose to use only prototype or jquery
[16:10:43] <supsup> not both
[16:10:45] <supsup> if possible
[16:11:03] <supsup> ? jQuery.noConflict()

[16:11:10] <dismist> any programmers out there able to code adobe air and have a general understanding of expired domains?
[16:11:45] <unclemantis> oh wait a minute. prototype is not jquery? woooops
[16:11:48] <unclemantis> back to #rails i go LOL
[16:11:58] <supsup> wow wow!
[16:19:02] <djQuery> any used jqueryui.position to center an element on the visible screen?
[16:19:18] <dismist> u dont need that
[16:19:29] <dismist> position isnt part of jquery ui
[16:20:18] <djQuery> .position({my: 'center center', at: 'center center', of: ??????});
[16:20:27] <djQuery> dismist: see ?ui.position

[16:28:35] <Mrfloyd_> jquery ajax is not working inside phonegap application iphone ios 3.1
[16:28:43] <Mrfloyd_> whereas normal ajax js code works
[16:31:55] <ejo> Got a problem with a $.ajax POST request here... Firebug shows two different tabs next to the failed request... "params" and "post".  In params all three of my data are there, but in post only two.  The missing one is a URL that I first encoded with encodeURI.
[16:32:50] <ejo> does that ring any bells for obvious mistakes people make?  do encoded URIs just not pass as POST parameters?  Am I supposed to send the information a different way?
[16:33:13] <ejo> (hopefully that isn't a complex enough situation to need a pastebin... all i would paste anyway is exactly what I just described)
[16:34:04] <deadman87> Good Evening people :)
[16:34:47] <ejo> oh, duh.
[16:35:12] <ejo> I needed encodeURIComponent -- not encodeURI since it was only called on a single param.  Sorry this ended up being a pure-JS question.  'later all!
[16:36:26] <joikus> you guys, I have a bunch of urls that end likes this bla.com/cow/32.html or bla.com/chicken/47.html
[16:36:44] <joikus> how can I grab the 32 and 47 from location ?
[16:50:35] <echo66> greetings community
[16:50:40] <echo66> *jquery community
[16:50:43] <echo66> anyone in here?
[16:50:49] <snover> ?anyone @ echo66
[16:50:50] <bot-t1> echo66, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[16:50:52] <lacrymology> is there a way I can call an object's 'click' listeners?
[16:51:01] <snover> lacrymology: yes.
[16:51:11] <snover> lacrymology: the api docs for click actually tell you exactly how to do that
[16:51:12] <echo66> LOL
[16:51:15] <echo66> ok
[16:51:24] <echo66> so...my questions is preeeeeeeeeeettyyyy simple
[16:51:42] <echo66> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-ajax-with-get-method-and-data-in-the-http-body
[16:51:56] <echo66> seriously, i dont know how i can be even more explicit
[16:51:57] <echo66> :S
[16:53:27] <snover> echo66: GET requests have no body.
[16:53:46] <echo66> but...
[16:53:52] <blindMoe> yeah was wondering why you would try to have body content in a request
[16:54:00] <echo66> i can do GET requests, with php, with body content
[16:54:06] <echo66> for example, to use SOAP
[16:54:07] <echo66> o.O
[16:54:22] <echo66> i put the xml structure in the body
[16:54:46] <echo66> or to encrypt certain parameters that can be visible in the querystring
[16:56:13] <echo66> do you guys understand??
[16:56:14] <blindMoe> echo66: did you try:  processData: false   ?
[16:56:25] <deadman87> Hello World :) Can anyone help with this: http://pastebin.com/ScJa5x1Y
[16:56:29] <echo66> hmm no. let me see that
[16:56:31] <blindMoe> yeah I understand.. but it is 5pm and I don't want to do anything right now ;)
[16:56:37] <deadman87> the question is included in the pastebin.. dont wanna spam here lol
[16:56:53] <blindMoe> echo66: if you read the docs for $.ajax.data you would have found $.ajax.processData
[16:58:34] <echo66> so...if i put the value false
[16:58:48] <echo66> will the data be included in the body? or am i getting this wrong? :S
[16:58:59] <imsky> a snaaaake
[16:59:05] <blindMoe> try it out.. I have never tried it but it seems like that is what it does
[16:59:28] <echo66> ok Moe
[16:59:42] <echo66> give me a moment and i will try it
[16:59:47] <deadman87> blindMoe: can u please have a look at http://pastebin.com/ScJa5x1Y :) thanks
[16:59:52] <blindMoe> nope
[17:00:03] <blindMoe> sorry.. late in the day and have work to do
[17:00:21] <deadman87> basically I want to repeat and ajax call as soon as it succeeds or fails
[17:00:31] <deadman87> kinda like.. polling
[17:01:20] <deadman87> right now the calls keep incrementing
[17:01:24] <deadman87> which isnt what I want
[17:09:48] <echo66> back
[17:09:51] <echo66> Moe, you there?
[17:10:09] <echo66> in the serverside, i have these 3 print_r's
[17:10:11] <echo66> var_dump($_GET); 		var_dump($_POST); 		var_dump($requestData);
[17:10:18] <echo66> with processData :false
[17:10:25] <djQuery> deadman87: functionDoAjax(){  $.ajax({ comple: DoAjax} }
[17:10:25] <echo66> none of the have content
[17:10:26] <echo66> LOL
[17:10:33] <djQuery> complete rather
[17:10:50] <deadman87> thanks djQuery.. checking it out now
[17:11:27] <echo66> djquery, can you take a look at this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-ajax-with-get-method-and-data-in-the-http-body
[17:11:38] <djQuery> dang we need to get bot-t to understan ?.ajax#complete kinda syntax
[17:13:26] <deadman87> lol it works djQuery :D
[17:13:38] <deadman87> I was just lazy to go read up.. I admit lol
[17:13:57] <djQuery> deadman87: well yeah thats how complete works
[17:14:12] <echo66> djQuery, now that you are free...
[17:14:14] <djQuery> ?.ajax#complete
[17:14:14] <bot-t1> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#complete
[17:14:15] <echo66> :P
[17:14:42] <echo66> i have been battling with that for hours :S
[17:14:52] <djQuery> well bot-t understands it but there are no links for the individual items
[17:15:27] <djQuery> echo66: probably not. have you tried different browsers to see if it is browser specific?
[17:15:40] <echo66> hmmmm
[17:15:44] <echo66> no, i havent
[17:15:44] <djQuery> why not just use post if you want the items sent in the header?
[17:15:48] <echo66> good idea...
[17:15:52] <echo66> well
[17:16:01] <echo66> because im using the teoric idea
[17:16:06] <echo66> of REST API's
[17:16:08] <djQuery> echo66: or are u trying something rest
[17:16:14] <echo66> yup
[17:16:31] <djQuery> then settle for it being in the querystring
[17:16:46] <echo66> but...there are parameters that i need to encrypt
[17:16:49] <echo66> like username
[17:16:51] <echo66> and password
[17:17:00] <echo66> in authenticated requests
[17:17:01] <echo66> :S
[17:17:17] <echo66> and whatever parameters the services need to have encrypted
[17:17:38] <echo66> that's why i want to use the body in GET requests
[17:17:40] <djQuery> echo66: why are u passing those at all just becuase you are not passing them in the query sting doesnt mean they are safe. are u using ssl even?
[17:17:55] <djQuery> echo66: those should be stored in the session object
[17:18:02] <echo66> no but later, i will activate ssl
[17:18:15] <djQuery> echo66: still
[17:18:56] <dr34mc0d3r> how can i stop other functions from running when more than one function is tied to an eventhandler?
[17:19:08] <echo66> i never used the $_SESSION variable....im a little newbie
[17:19:08] <echo66> x.x
[17:19:44] <djQuery> echo66: still thats a no brainer
[17:20:08] <echo66> but, one detail:
[17:20:58] <echo66> im building an integration platform. So, sometimes, i need to have certain parameters encrypted that are to be sent to the service
[17:21:20] <echo66> that's the main reason i want to put parameters in the body when i do GET requests
[17:21:51] <djQuery> echo66 there are other ways to send em
[17:22:18] <echo66> encrypted??? how? o.O
[17:25:34] <echo66> any clue
[17:25:35] <echo66> ?
[17:25:49] <djQuery> dang this is pretty cool http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[17:26:29] <echo66> :|
[17:27:04] <djQuery> echo66 as part of the headers
[17:27:26] <djQuery> echo66: not the expert here on this
[17:27:32] <echo66> oh ok :/
[17:28:23] <echo66> btw
[17:28:30] <echo66> pretty cool that demo
[17:28:56] <djQuery> echo66: just in time for a database designer I am building
[17:29:53] <echo66> ohhh
[17:31:08] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/uxenub/38/edit
[17:33:55] <echo66> is it supposed to have some connections like in that demo?
[17:34:18] <djQuery> echo66: yeah to demonstrate relationships
[17:34:39] <echo66> i cant see any connection
[17:34:41] <echo66> :S
[17:34:54] <djQuery> echo66: cause I just found plumb.js
[17:34:55] <echo66> im dragging the boxes
[17:35:00] <echo66> oh
[17:45:29] <siebo> I have a page that has an iframe, and inside that iframe is a link
[17:45:51] <siebo> I want to change the target on that link so that it open in the parent window, and simulate a click on that link
[17:46:10] <siebo> but I only have access to the code in the parent page that contains the iframe
[17:46:16] <siebo> is this possible with jQuery?
[17:46:37] <systemfault> siebo: Depends.
[17:46:46] <systemfault> siebo: Is the iframe on the same domain?
[17:46:56] <siebo> systemfault: yes
[17:48:58] <systemfault> I never actually tried that.. but it should be possible, you can target the content of the iframe with $('some selector that selects the iframe').content().find('the link selector').click();
[17:49:20] <systemfault> You would of course add a handler to click
[17:49:43] <siebo> systemfault: cool, thanks
[17:49:44] <systemfault> But to be honest, I'm guessing more than anything, I avoid iframes.
[17:50:12] <siebo> systemfault: yes, I'm not fond of them.  It's a choice my client made...
[17:50:15] <systemfault> If the iframe is on the same domain, you can access it with .content(), that.. I'm sure
[17:50:24] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[17:52:53] <djQuery> siebo: see ?sop
[17:52:53] <bot-t1> siebo, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[17:55:28] <systemfault> siebo: http://jsfiddle.net/DLPW3/
[17:55:54] <systemfault> It's .contents()  :'( sorry
[17:56:27] <siebo> systemfault: cool, thanks!!
[17:56:56] <vindice> If you have a jquery selection as a variable, how to you then select within it with a path like ('.class1 > .class2') ?
[17:57:16] <vindice> You can do collection.children('.class1 > .class2')
[17:57:35] <vindice> you can use .find() but I'd like to be more specifiic
[17:58:06] <systemfault> Sorry.. I'm not getting the idea :(
[17:58:38] <systemfault> Use a more specific selector..
[17:58:43] <vindice> sorry, here's an e.g. var container = $('#container')
[17:59:11] <vindice> inside container say are child  elements with class="class1"
[17:59:29] <vindice> and inside some of the class1 elements are children with class="class2"
[17:59:48] <vindice> you can't do container.children('.class1 > class2')
[18:00:09] <vindice> i.e. I want to specify an absolute path
[18:00:21] <systemfault> $('#container .class1 > .class2') ?
[18:00:25] <vindice> yep sure
[18:00:34] <vindice> but I've already got #container as a variable
[18:00:44] <vindice> and my example is vastly simplified
[18:00:52] <systemfault> You would use find normally.
[18:01:14] <systemfault> Or $('.class1 > .class2', myContainer);
[18:01:16] <systemfault> Same thing.
[18:01:22] <vindice> yep
[18:01:42] <vindice> but I want to avoid container.children('.class1').children('.class2')
[18:01:49] <vindice> but be just as specific
[18:02:17] <systemfault> I don't get the "why"
[18:02:19] <vindice> this is actually traversing an xml doc so it's not as simple to have a workaround as my example suggests
[18:02:27] <systemfault> Ah
[18:02:47] <vindice> and obviously I can use .children().children().children()...... ad nauseum
[18:03:06] <vindice> but surely there has to be a way of using the expressiveness of jquery
[18:03:27] <systemfault> It's difficult to be more expressive than CSS selectors :/
[18:03:45] <vindice> I just want to be able to use the > >  > >
[18:03:46] <systemfault> You could use XPath if you love XML :(
[18:03:59] <vindice> without having to select the top element
[18:04:13] <vindice> I've got loads of xpath in sql
[18:05:14] <systemfault> But jQuery doesn't really do any magic, sizzle is basically a document.querySelector with extensions :(
[18:05:21] <systemfault> *querySelectorAll
[18:05:30] <vindice> it's hardly magic I'm after
[18:06:09] <vindice> why does $(aThing).children('a > b') work?
[18:06:17] <vindice> it's not like it's potentially ambiguous
[18:06:38] <systemfault> It works or doesn,t?
[18:06:55] <vindice> no, that's exactly my point
[18:08:09] <systemfault> If it works, what would it do more than .find?
[18:08:19] <vindice> hmmm or maybe it does work but not on xml
[18:08:25] <vindice> seems to work find on divs for example
[18:08:46] <vindice> .find will return any pattern you give it however deep into the hierarchy
[18:08:48] <vindice> I don't want that
[18:09:04] <vindice> I want an absolute path from the top
[18:09:43] <systemfault> Then use > all the way?
[18:10:09] <vindice> systemfault: The entire point of this conversation is that I can't
[18:10:12] <vindice> it doesn#t work
[18:10:35] <systemfault> 2 seconds, I'll write an example to see  :/
[18:12:13] <vindice> systemfault: ffs, it's an xml thing
[18:12:21] <vindice> it works find with html elements
[18:12:35] <vindice> and why can't I type all of a sudden
[18:12:39] <vindice> *fine
[18:13:46] <vindice> var d = $('#grandparentDiv'); d.children('div > div') //works fine
[18:14:00] <systemfault> Ahh :(
[18:14:09] <systemfault> Sucks if it's a XML problem
[18:14:21] <vindice> aGrandParentXMLNode.children('Parent > Child'); does not work
[18:14:57] <vindice> yep, although jquery's getting better at it. $.parseXML is a big step forward - i.e. not converting tags and attributes to lower case is a nice advance
[18:15:42] <vindice> thanks for talking it through :)
[18:15:52] <systemfault> :P

[18:24:51] <RobW> here's the resize code: http://pastebin.com/ChJZUkYb
[18:31:36] <RobW> nvm got it
[18:44:23] <solidus-river> how do i check the http response code of an ajax request via jQuery?
[18:47:47] <iszak> in the callback args usually
[18:49:39] <solidus-river> is there an example of this?
[18:53:05] <iszak> solidus-river, yes, depends on what method?
[18:53:10] <iszak> what method are you trying to call?
[18:53:32] <solidus-river> isark: i'm trying to check the response cod, ie 200, 201, 202, 100
[18:53:43] <solidus-river> isark: of an ajax request
[18:53:53] <solidus-river> er, and ajax request response
[18:54:39] <iszak> I know.
[18:55:25] <solidus-river> iszak: erm.. what do you mean what method am i trying to call then
[18:55:36] <iszak> Well are you using $.ajax or $.get or $.post
[18:55:38] <iszak> etc
[18:56:56] <solidus-river> $.ajax mostly
[18:57:26] <gnrlbzik> hey azatoth_work
[18:57:47] <iszak> solidus-river, what callback?
[18:59:00] <solidus-river> iszack success, i see it gets a string textStatus
[18:59:15] <solidus-river> is that string generally HTTP/1.1 201, or is it Status: 201 or is it just 201
[18:59:17] <iszak> not what you want.
[18:59:31] <solidus-river> damn, then i'm lost
[19:00:07] <iszak> solidus-river, http://pastie.org/2147929
[19:00:45] <iszak> event should probably be called xhr or so
[19:02:06] <solidus-river> iszak: cool! thanks! so if i get hte xhr from jquery i can call xhr.status to check the code
[19:02:24] <iszak> yeah although as far as I know it's jqXHR not XHR exactly
[19:03:11] <iszak> omg bot-t has been upgraded to bot-t1 !!!
[19:04:53] <solidus-river> iszak: ; thank you for your help :)
[19:06:19] <iszak> no problem
[19:06:29] <coldhead> group hug
[19:06:40] <iszak> how about group sex instead?
[19:06:41] <coldhead> no, i mean groupon
[19:06:55] <coldhead> not tonight, channel, i have a headache
[19:07:05] <iszak> it's day time for us..
[19:07:14] <coldhead> not today*
[19:07:29] <iszak> :(
[19:07:34] <iszak> I was looking forward to it all week
[19:07:58] <iszak> coldhead, how's ruby? jython? wtflanguageyourdoingrightnow going?
[19:08:05] <coldhead> anticipation is better than the real thing
[19:08:58] <coldhead> it's been scheme this week, iszak
[19:09:02] <coldhead> and it's been good
[19:09:15] <coldhead> so much recursion
[19:09:42] <iszak> coldhead, ah right, I spent some time with node.js yesterday after a hiatus on it.
[19:10:05] <coldhead> how was that?
[19:10:25] <iszak> lots of callbacks
[19:10:30] <coldhead> :D
[19:10:32] <coldhead> well summarised
[19:11:26] <iszak> I love being able to use new JS functions like Array.forEach and Array.isArray
[19:12:46] <Patman> does anyone know the best way to wrap a divs contents in a new div <div id="1">Lots of Content</div> to <div id="1"><div id="2">Lots of Content</div></div>
[19:14:41] <iszak> ?wrap @ Patman
[19:14:41] <bot-t1> Patman, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[19:14:49] <iszak> Also pure numerical values for ids is invalid.
[19:14:58] <kurol> not for html5
[19:15:08] <Patman> was just sample real quick, let me check out wrap
[19:15:15] <iszak> there's also
[19:15:23] <iszak> ?wrapAll @ Patman
[19:15:23] <bot-t1> Patman, .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[19:15:31] <iszak> kurol, nice?
[19:15:48] <kurol> convenient? kinda a bad practice usually
[19:15:53] <kurol> but oh well
[19:16:14] <iszak> id="1" isn't very descriptive either.
[19:20:39] <Patman> all i have is the container ID. is there any way to do like a innerWrapALl
[19:21:26] <Patman> wrap would work perfect if the elements were the same
[19:22:19] <Patman> but im looking for like $('div#a').innerWrap($('<div/>').attr({id:'b
[19:22:56] <Patman> or instead of wrapping moving the content of a div to a newly created one
[19:23:43] <Patman> well they have wrapInner lol that may be exaclty what I need
[19:26:45] <iszak> ?wrapInner @ Patman
[19:26:45] <bot-t1> Patman, .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[19:29:05] <Patman> yup that worked perfect, thank you iszak
[19:29:15] <iszak> Patman, you were so close too!
[19:29:39] <Patman> i knew it had to be easy i mean its jquery!
[19:29:52] <iszak> I prefer ExtJS
[19:31:03] <Patman> ill have to check that out
[19:31:42] <iszak> Patman, it's good for rapid UI development, anything else low level like wrapInner, forget about it
[19:45:48] <glaksmono> how do you check for an empty array
[19:45:49] <glaksmono> console.log($('#create_event_eventid')); returns []
[19:46:06] <ryanseddon> .length
[19:46:36] <glaksmono> ah
[19:46:48] <glaksmono> but if it's parameters
[19:46:50] <glaksmono> or object
[19:46:54] <glaksmono> the length is > 0 ??
[19:47:08] <Patman> yes
[20:02:15] <t4nk004> test
[20:03:03] <t4nk004> im a noob
[20:11:25] <glaksmono> how to check "If this variable is not type Array" in PHP?
[20:12:58] <xtrci> glaksmono: you can do if(!is_array($var))
[20:15:58] <djQuery> dang sortable is kinda glitch on a table
[20:20:18] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me
[20:20:22] <coldhead> thx
[20:39:22] <krzkrzkrz> does jquery have this same effect: http://jsfiddle.net/sSnKh/ ?
[20:39:32] <krzkrzkrz> slidein instead of slidedown ?
[20:40:59] <ty2u> hey, is it possible to use jquery to copy contents of a div into an iframe?
[20:41:21] <krz> anyone?
[20:42:40] <systemfault> ty2u: Should be possible as long as you have access to the iframe..
[20:42:49] <systemfault> (If the iframe is on the same domain)
[20:43:55] <coldhead> ?animate @ krz
[20:44:13] <coldhead> you can use animate() to create your own animations
[20:44:27] <evlew> also .slideDown() for simple stuff
[20:44:38] <ty2u> systemfault, yeah its on the same page actually. i just want to put the div contents into an iframe. not the other way around. but for some reason it isn't showing up there.
[20:44:51] <krz> evlew: slideDown doesnt do that same effect exactly
[20:45:05] <krz> coldhead: what is involved for that to work with animate? height?
[20:45:14] <systemfault> ty2u: Is the source of the iframe on the same domain?
[20:45:15] <coldhead> krz: you can read the source for slideDown and it will be obvious what you need to change
[20:45:49] <ty2u> systemfault, well there is no iframe source. i want the source to be the contents of this div.
[20:45:52] <coldhead> probably just need to swap width for height and left for top or somesuch
[20:46:12] <coldhead> that sounds very awkward, ty2u
[20:46:18] <coldhead> why have the iframe at all?
[20:48:21] <ty2u> coldhead, well they have a user pasting in two forms that have to be submitted at once. that was just one solution i could think of.
[20:58:57] <krz> coldhead: why would i need to swap width for height?
[21:06:30] <Tallisman> How do i read ["e".
[21:06:57] <Tallisman> ["e", "a"]
[21:07:32] <sarazeroo> hello everyone...someone knows how to make a hide function at the begin of a document, before all the images has been loaded?
[21:07:34] <Tallisman> currently I am trying json[i'], but this results it getting parsed as a string instead of array
[21:08:02] <Tallisman> you could use css to do so sarazeroo
[21:08:43] <sarazeroo> but in css if I put "visibility:hidden" all the "x.show();" functions doesn't works
[21:08:49] <sarazeroo> :S
[21:09:04] <sarazeroo> its like it hides forever by CSS :S
[21:10:58] <sarazeroo> i dont know what to do u.u
[21:11:14] <Tallisman> display: none;
[21:12:43] <sarazeroo> i tried with an "onload" and a "x.ready.$("div:not(#menu)").css("display", "none");" and works, but at the begin all images load and then they hide
[21:13:17] <Tallisman> well, onload is pretty much the thing that fires when the page is done loading..
[21:13:45] <sarazeroo> i don't want to anyone could see my images
[21:14:44] <Tallisman> best way to do it still is css, but you could try this.$("div:not(#menu)").css("display", "none");  <-- in the script tag, nothing else.
[21:15:35] <sarazeroo> I tried "x.ready.function hideeverything(){$("div:not(#menu)").css("display", "none");"}" and the other "x.ready.function hide() {$("div:not(#menu)").hide();	$("#header").show(); }"
[21:16:33] <sarazeroo> i will try with "this"
[21:19:16] <Whirl3d> sarazeroo, perhaps you could make a css class that had opacity:0 in it's definition, apply it to your images, then fade them in and remove the class. That's how I do it and it works fine
[21:20:27] <sarazeroo> Whirl3d...could u explain me more specific about that?
[21:21:44] <Whirl3d> in your css for your document, create a class called "loading" and in it's definition, say opacity:0. Then you load the images using .load() and with the callback of .load(), you'd fade in the images and remove the class .loading
[21:22:45] <Whirl3d> $("someImage").load(url, function () {$(this).animate({opacity:1},2000,function () {$(this).removeClass('loading')}}));
[21:23:10] <Whirl3d> not sure about the })'s I may have one too many or too few, but you get the point.
[21:23:50] <Whirl3d> You will want to use .load rather than apply the src. attribute to get around a bug in IE<8 that won't fire if the images are cached
[21:23:52] <sarazeroo> Yeah thx...i get it
[21:29:37] <sarazeroo> i think i can apply that to some divs and not images...right?
[21:30:05] <Whirl3d> Yep. I often apply it to the body element so that nothing shows until my key images are loaded/prepped
[21:34:39] <sarazeroo> do i need any specify core to that?
[21:37:48] <Whirl3d> huh?
[21:39:32] <sarazeroo> i mean...i dont have the UI Cores...are they necessary?
[21:40:50] <systemfault> Do you really want an answer?
[21:40:53] <systemfault> Seriously.
[21:41:49] <sarazeroo> no i know it...srry
[21:41:59] <sarazeroo> it was a silly question
[21:42:03] <sarazeroo> srry...realy
[21:46:18] <Whirl3d> how would I select all items of class "topic" that have position().top<0?
[21:48:25] <djQuery> Whirl3d: $('.topic').filter(function(elm){ return (this.css.top ===0); });
[21:49:50] <Whirl3d> djQuery, thank you. So the filter function returns true or false to work, right?
[21:50:47] <systemfault> djQuery: this.css.top?
[21:50:50] <Whirl3d> basically, I am trying to create a simple function that checks if a div contained in a scrolling div is visible or if it is scrolled off the page
[21:51:06] <systemfault> djQuery: this.style.top?
[21:54:32] <djQuery> Whirl3d: systemfault: new it was something like that
[21:56:48] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/uyedi5/edit
[22:00:26] <systemfault> cool :)
[22:02:57] <Whirl3d> djQuery, what is that jsbin, it doesn't do anything for me
[22:04:25] <Whirl3d> Here is kind of what I am trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/GJmbr/13/
[22:05:04] <Whirl3d> I'm just having problems with selecting the "next" and "prev" topics
[22:10:44] <Gates> Ping!
[22:16:01] <Whirl3d> djQuery, systemfault, can you help me figure out why I'm not getting values for first and last visible topics?
[22:23:10] <Engin> I want to get the width of an image... and for that I suppose I have to wait until it is loaded but .load() is not reliable. any idea ?
[22:23:52] <Whirl3d> Why is .load unreliable?
[22:24:03] <dytrivedi> load is the only way AFAIK
[22:24:55] <dytrivedi> welcome, krhebbar
[22:25:29] <dytrivedi> ?weather @ krhebbar
[22:25:30] <bot-t> krhebbar, Bengaluru, Karnataka - Time: 10:55 Friday (IST), Weather: Partly Cloudy, 22C / 71F
[22:25:57] <ussher_> Im almost at where i need to be.  .va().indexOf('someword')  will fire and do what i want  but how do i add multiple words in place of 'someword'?  Ive tried defining an array and using that in place, but its not working.
[22:26:20] <ussher_> The goal is to fire if someword is typed into a textarea.  like AT or @
[22:26:29] <sarazeroo> <Whirl3d> .... i can't make it work....i do everything you said and the body never appears.
[22:27:10] <sarazeroo> srry if i look like a silly boy...but i'll appreciate your help in this.
[22:27:15] <Whirl3d> sarazeroo, are you using display:none? Because that is different than opacity:0.
[22:30:29] <dytrivedi> welcome, Paul__
[22:30:29] <Whirl3d> ussher_, I'm afraid you are going to have to loop through your list of items you want to check against.
[22:30:40] <dytrivedi> yeah, ussher_ you're gonna have to loop
[22:30:47] <ussher_> ahhhh, damn.
[22:30:47] <dytrivedi> indexOf just doesn't work that way
[22:30:54] <Paul__> Hey Dhaval :) thanks!
[22:30:54] <ussher_> thanks though.
[22:31:12] <sarazeroo> srry but i use: $("body").load(function () {$(this).animate({opacity:1},2000,function () {$(this).removeClass('loading')})});
[22:31:26] <sarazeroo> in body: <body class="loading">
[22:31:38] <Whirl3d> I was thinking you could use the [prop*=val] option, but that won't work with multiple vals either.
[22:31:39] <sarazeroo> in css: .loading { 	opacity: 0; }
[22:31:42] <ussher_> Whirl3d++
[22:31:46] <ussher_> dytrivedi++
[22:31:58] <dytrivedi> aww thanks man
[22:32:12] <dytrivedi> NOW WHERE'S LAMPOON
[22:32:15] <dytrivedi> .seen Lampoon
[22:32:16] <hsbot> Lampoon was seen 17 hours, 9 minutes and 28 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: laerti was last seen in #jquery 28 min 11 sec ago saying 'ok'.
[22:32:26] <dytrivedi> ohh ok
[22:32:28] <dytrivedi> he's here
[22:32:30] <Whirl3d> sarazeroo, you don't use body.load(). use $(document).ready(function () {$("body").animate({opacity:1},2000,.....
[22:32:54] <dytrivedi> $(body).load?? huh?
[22:33:18] <dytrivedi> I think we used $(window).load
[22:33:35] <sarazeroo> u.u i feel like stupid...dont say any opinion plz
[22:33:50] <Whirl3d> we were talking about loading images earlier and I said that I use the same trick with the body element. But I meant the idea of setting css to opacity:0 for body and once loaded, fade it in and remove the class
[22:34:06] <dytrivedi> ohh so to avoid FOUC?
[22:34:16] <Whirl3d> precisely.
[22:34:22] <sarazeroo> lol srry :P
[22:34:28] <dytrivedi> well that's good then
[22:34:56] <Whirl3d> sarazeroo, I am sorry I wasn't more clear.
[22:36:24] <Whirl3d> So, I have written a function that determines if a div (within a scrolling div) is visible. It adds a class to the div if visible and returns true. If not, it removes the class and returns false
[22:36:54] <Whirl3d> So, I can have two divs in the visible area and they both get the "active" class added
[22:37:19] <Whirl3d> But I am trying the get the div just before the first active div and just after the last active div. I can't get it to work
[22:38:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/GJmbr/14/
[22:44:50] <Whirl3d> there should be a convention for jquery functions that continue the chain and for those that break the chain.
[22:45:10] <dytrivedi> hmm for now it's just that we have to know!
[22:45:31] <dytrivedi> but it depends on the kind of operation you perform
[22:45:42] <dytrivedi> so should be clear
[22:46:27] <Whirl3d> But with people extending jquery with plugins, you can't always know
[22:46:37] <Whirl3d> so, a convention would solve the problem.
[22:46:59] <tbranyen> Whirl3d: there is
[22:47:01] <tbranyen> a convention
[22:47:08] <Whirl3d> cool, what is it?
[22:47:20] <tbranyen> getters that don't return a jquery collection break, everything returns a jquery collection
[22:47:29] <tbranyen> everything else*
[22:47:43] <Whirl3d> but how do you know by looking at the function
[22:47:50] <Whirl3d> I mean, the naming convention
[22:47:58] <tbranyen> that'll never happen
[22:48:08] <tbranyen> and is rather hungarian notation
[22:48:12] <tbranyen> which is ugly
[22:48:19] <Whirl3d> ?
[22:48:22] <Whirl3d> really?
[22:48:46] <tbranyen> Whirl3d: looking at a function and telling if it returns a jquery collection or not is fairly obvious
[22:48:50] <tbranyen> at least it hasn't really been a problem in core
[22:48:50] <Whirl3d> like the convention a lot of people use for jquery variables by adding $varname=$(".someclass")
[22:49:03] <tbranyen> which is considered hungarian since it infers type
[22:49:18] <Whirl3d> never heard of hungarian before
[22:49:25] <dytrivedi> tbranyen: my point exactly
[22:49:46] <tbranyen> jQuery("#something").attr("id") obviously returns the id and not a jquery collection
[22:49:54] <dytrivedi> it is fairly obvious
[22:50:13] <tbranyen> attrDoesNotReturnjQueryCollection("id") i guess is more obvious
[22:50:14] <Whirl3d> right, but $(".something").max("height")
[22:50:23] <Whirl3d> does that return a height value or a single element
[22:50:29] <Whirl3d> It's unclear
[22:50:31] <tbranyen> Whirl3d: thats a problem with documentation
[22:50:34] <tbranyen> not naming conventions
[22:50:37] <dytrivedi> yep
[22:50:44] <Whirl3d> I didn't say it was a problem, mind you
[22:51:01] <tbranyen> neither did i, i just said its a problem with documentation if you can't tell
[22:52:01] <sarazeroo> ITS WORKING THNKS A LOT TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!! :D
[22:52:17] <Whirl3d> hooray

[22:56:52] <dytrivedi> very carefully!
[22:57:09] <sarazeroo> i had to add some things but its working...thnks alot
[22:57:31] <dytrivedi> krz: show some coads
[22:57:59] <krz> dytrivedi: whats hard to understand with that statement?
[22:58:15] <krz> i need to target all child elements inside a parent element
[22:58:29] <dytrivedi> so you can
[22:58:35] <dytrivedi> if you can't, you're doing somethin' wrong
[22:58:42] <krz> wtf
[22:58:44] <dytrivedi> which is why I asked for coads
[22:58:48] <krz> im asking how to do it
[22:58:51] <krz> i havent done it yet
[22:59:02] <dytrivedi> so

[22:59:29] <krz> thanks
[23:01:02] <Whirl3d> dytrivedi, thanks for the info about hungarian notation. I just read about it and I'm not sure on which side I stand? for or against some form of hungarianism. lol

[23:12:45] <gnrlbzik> i need some help with jquery ui autocomplete
[23:13:38] <gnrlbzik> i need to display list of all items but only start filtering after entry of two characters
[23:14:17] <gnrlbzik> i can display the list right away with minLength: 0, but if i set it to two characters then list is not displayed right away
[23:15:04] <ty2u> how can i preventDefault on a submit button inside an iframe with a local file for src
[23:39:36] <Whirl3d> don't think I've seen it this quiet in here for a while
