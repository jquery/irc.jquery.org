[00:22:37] <Blooxwr> How can I build a dynamic array like this: product[cat][id]=3, product[cat][amount]=5. Data comes from a form by using jquery $.each() to check if conditions match... I can't use js .push either, because that uses incrementing array keys - so they end up like product[0][cat][id]=3, product[1][cat][id]=4 etc...
[01:01:52] <teleyinex> Hi everyone
[01:02:11] <teleyinex> do you know how you can reset the state of a Deferred object?
[01:05:02] <teleyinex> I get it run once, but the second time I want to re-run the function it doesn't work
[01:08:55] <raj> coldhead, still around?
[01:12:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Hello channel! I have a problem that might not be related to jquery, but it is definately related to javascript (and it might be the jquery)... I have a text box that has become uneditable for some reason, but I have nothing in the script that disables anything at all. If I disable CSS, I still have the problem, but if I disable JS it works.
[01:12:59] <coppa> Larholm: I changed my automatic ajac navigation plugin with your advice : target <= content https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[01:13:09] <raj> ChrisTheSorcerer, is there an error in the console?
[01:13:22] <raj> or do you have `debugger;` in your code?
[01:13:33] <raj> or is it breaking on some line?
[01:13:47] <ChrisTheSorcerer> nope, not other than the CSS expecting a color but recievs #333333 warning
[01:14:11] <raj> you haven't set any breakpoints by accident either I presume
[01:14:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I don't even use the firebug for step-by-step, I think it's way too much code to go trough >.<
[01:14:59] <raj> perhaps paste your js code
[01:15:15] <ChrisTheSorcerer> all 500+ lines?
[01:15:40] <ChrisTheSorcerer> :P
[01:16:19] <JaredCE> how can i do a nextUntil(".Subsubhead") OR nextUntil(".Subhead")
[01:17:09] <raj> eek, not sure
[01:17:13] <raj> obv a js problem though
[01:17:17] <Gaia> hey guys
[01:17:32] <Gaia> Was it jsfiddle where i could test my javascript? :>
[01:17:37] <raj> ChrisTheSorcerer, i'd comment out your code section by section until you narrow down where the error is happening
[01:17:42] <raj> Gaia, yes
[01:17:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, the line it keeps breaking on is one that handles the mouseover, but I think that's jut because my mouse have to go over the canvas to get to the text box >.<
[01:17:45] <Gaia> ty
[01:18:05] <raj> thought so :)
[01:18:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> but the text box is nowhere near the canvas, and all other inputs (including other text boxes) works fine
[01:19:00] <raj> breaking always does weird stuff, interaction-wise, on my page
[01:19:07] <raj> removing the break fixed it ChrisTheSorcerer?
[01:19:31] <Xotix> if i have class like class?"someid-22"; is it easy to get the 22?
[01:20:07] <raj> Xotix, yes
[01:20:37] <raj> myarray = myclassvalue.split('-')
[01:20:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> no, it wasn't a break point, I set it to autobreak on first conflict to see if I could spot the problem ;)
[01:20:54] <Xotix> raj thanks nice :)
[01:21:12] <raj> wc
[01:21:12] <caniuse> raj: WEB CLOASED >: |
[01:21:19] <raj> no
[01:21:22] <raj> welcome
[01:22:04] <ChrisTheSorcerer> and it broke there because the mouseover wants to find an element I haven't put out yet, when I put the element there I found what might be the problem... in the body I have onmousedown="return false;" for some reason....
[01:23:16] <raj> cool
[01:23:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> removed it, works fine
[01:23:21] <killer11> hello people, anyone that  knows about the 555 timer calculaton around? im finding multiple calculations around. looking at the first link you see they say that the frequency is the reciprical of t1+t1. but in the second link they say its divided by 1.4
[01:23:22] <killer11> http://www.ecelab.com/circuit-astable-555.htm
[01:23:29] <killer11> http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/555timer.htm
[01:23:50] <killer11> they are the two links. using a 555 as astable.
[01:25:23] <Larholm> coppa, nice! looking good :)
[01:27:01] <optraz> i have $("#id p").text("new text"); the problem right now is that, it change *every* p in #id, how do i only apply the function text() to p which does not have class?
[01:33:19] <subdesign> is it possibla that I can't fadeOut a twitter bootstrap alert window in runtime? I can do it on firefox console
[01:33:23] <subdesign> *possible

[01:37:34] <astropirate> osa1, http://bit.ly/HnpEC0
[01:43:44] <JaredCE> i take it theres no way to do on a nextUntil then?
[01:43:53] <JaredCE> to do an OR
[01:45:42] <ChrisTheSorcerer> is it possible to have a text box run a function when enter is pressed, and only if the text box is being edited? (so it doesn't trigger on every enter press the user makes)
[01:47:15] <Sebah> Hey. I have a table ( it's a pricing page, so don't yell ) and I'm trying to get the width's of the <th> elements ( these have also some padding and borders ). How could I get a width() which is crossbrowser ( currently it's returning different values between the browsers )
[01:48:00] <ChrisTheSorcerer> something like $("textBox1").onEdit(onKeyPress("Enter")) or something like that.... (I know, really bad syntax, but I still don't fully understand the jquery shorthand)
[01:48:55] <astropirate> ChrisTheSorcerer, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5631589/detect-enter-key-is-pressed-with-jquery
[01:50:10] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Wow... almost exactly like I expected... Thanks Astro
[01:51:00] <PavelK> hi :) (ps. topic is outdated since 1.7.2 is out)
[01:51:13] <JaredCE> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9924494/jquery-nextuntil-filtering-for-multiple-classes/
[01:55:48] <john2x> does .each() work with ordinary array objects?
[01:56:02] <Sebah> So no knows how to get a crossbrowser width() for <th> elements?
[01:57:12] <astropirate> john2x, no,  use forEach()  for non jquery objects
[01:57:38] <astropirate> *arrays  not object
[01:57:41] <Sebah> * Forgot to mention that I'm using HTML5 doctype :)
[01:57:58] <Cork> ?jquery.each @ john2x
[01:57:59] <bot-t> john2x, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays.

Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[01:58:18] <john2x> cool. thanks!
[02:11:12] <optraz> apparnetly this is not working, anymore know how to make it work? $('#id').find('option[value="foo"]').change(function () {alert("alrted"); });
[02:14:43] <muszek> hi... is there some event for when the hash part of the URL changes?
[02:14:52] <mindis|wurk> optraz are you sure you're actually finding an element with $('#id')
[02:14:53] <muszek> window.location.hash
[02:15:27] <xec> optraz: maybe you want to listen to the <select> and not the <option>
[02:15:40] <mindis|wurk> that too
[02:17:56] <optraz> mindis|wurk: xec i want to apply find the option in the select. the select has id foo
[02:18:22] <xec> optraz: you mean inside the handler?
[02:18:47] <xec> why are you doing this
[02:19:13] <optraz> xec: when user select different option, i want to change a text in another field. that is what i want to do
[02:19:55] <xec> ok, then listen to change on the select element, and do your thing in the handler
[02:20:13] <optraz> ok, just one moment
[02:20:38] <optraz> wait..
[02:20:42] <optraz> what exactly do you mean by listen to change?
[02:20:49] <xec> optraz: http://jsfiddle.net/Kwyw9/1/
[02:21:52] <xec> optraz: what i mean is that the .change() lets you "listen" to the change event
[02:22:14] <mindis|wurk> someone skipped jquery basics again
[02:24:33] <mindis|wurk> anyone know if http://remysharp.com/2006/12/15/jquery-mousehold-event/ is still the most up to date method of doing mousehold events?
[02:24:43] <optraz> xec: aha.
[02:27:45] <optraz> xec: just one question, is the construct of $('#foo').find('option[value="foo"]').change(function() {}); is correct?
[02:28:26] <xec> optraz: i could be mistaken, but i don't think there is a change event on option elements
[02:29:23] <xec> optraz: if you want something to happen only when a given option is selected, you can check for it with an if inside the event handler
[02:29:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> options never change, so I can't see how there could be one... unless you have a list that changes the option by some other event
[02:29:59] <ChrisTheSorcerer> like e text box where the user gets to chose their own name for that option, but then you could have the event listener on the box instead
[02:30:11] <xec> optraz: which is listening to the select (which is what's changing)
[02:30:22] <ChrisTheSorcerer> exactly
[02:30:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> it's like having an event listener for the value of a paragraph
[02:31:08] <xec> without contenteditable :D
[02:31:25] <xec> optraz: http://jsfiddle.net/Kwyw9/
[02:31:53] * optraz reading
[02:32:45] <optraz> xec: okay, understood
[02:33:02] <ChrisTheSorcerer> you can have contenteditable on paragraphs?
[02:33:10] <xec> i think so
[02:33:16] <optraz> p.text();
[02:33:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I thought you had to have something in between, like a text box or something....
[02:34:42] <xec> ChrisTheSorcerer: .change() won't fire though http://jsfiddle.net/kfQ7Z/
[02:37:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> neither on the div, if you encapsule it: http://jsfiddle.net/kfQ7Z/
[02:38:11] <xec> that's the same link
[02:38:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> hmm, sorry, fiddle is being a bitch >.<
[02:38:26] <xec> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7802784/listening-to-events-of-a-contenteditable-html-element
[02:38:43] <xec> doesn't look promising
[02:38:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> http://jsfiddle.net/kfQ7Z/1/
[02:39:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Pretty sure I botched the syntax again thou >.<
[02:40:05] <xec> syntax looks ok, but i don't think change events bubble?
[02:40:12] <trondf> muszek: seems like there is a window.onhashchange (hashchange in jquery) event in newer browsers read this for more info http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[02:41:55] <xec> trondf, muszek: related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/680785/on-window-location-hash-change
[02:43:09] <optraz> xec: i've improvise :) http://jsfiddle.net/Kwyw9/3/ now how do i using OR so that when radio button is changed or select is change, alter the p text ?
[02:44:14] <xec> optraz: you can use a comma to separate selectors, for instance, if that's what you mean
[02:44:38] <optraz> xec: thought of that too but the find select does not exist in radio button
[02:45:18] <xec> optraz: http://jsfiddle.net/Kwyw9/4/
[02:45:27] <muszek> trondf, xec: thank you
[02:46:36] <trondf> xec: nice link
[02:49:55] <optraz> xec: thank you very much =)
[02:51:04] <Birliban> Hi, i need to fill a table with data from an ajax call. What is better/faster/more efficient? To append every row after the other or to iterate the rows into a var and then appent the whole thing?
[02:51:59] <PavelK> 2nd version got my vote ;)
[02:54:08] <PavelK> since dom manipulation is slow as hel
[02:54:39] <Birliban> PavelK, any other suggestions?
[02:55:48] <PavelK> nope, just the performance issue when there are more than X rows
[02:56:11] <PavelK> iterate, prepare html, inject
[02:56:48] <PavelK> dont know the faster option, besides just loading beforehand prepared html partial from the server
[02:57:05] <Birliban> hmm, what exactly does 'prepare html' mean?
[02:57:28] <mattyh88> I have this html button : <button type="button" onClick="window.print(); return false;">Print</button> But IE 8 is giving me a 'invalid procedure call or argument' error. What could this be?
[02:57:47] <PavelK> i mean u just ajax reload the $(element) from the url, and the url returns exacly what you would insert into the element on the page
[02:57:58] <mattyh88> in chrome, firefox, ie9 it works just fine
[02:59:09] <Birliban> PavelK, ah i see. hm, in this case i just get json data from server. but there are max. 20-30 rows, i think the speed won't be an issue there
[03:01:31] <PavelK> well, if this is an important page, you can always test it, chrome profiler is doing a good job in that field :)
[03:02:26] <PavelK> btw. one row at a time gives the opportunity to make some nifty animations :)
[03:03:18] <Birliban> not that important, but what if? i don't see a faster way... getting data, injecting it. preparing the data at an additional script would make it even slower...
[03:03:32] <Birliban> PavelK, yes, indeed ;-)
[03:09:07] <PavelK> in some cases i found that requesting an html which is returned by outside action of an app is sometimes faster (not in sense of execution) but in enduser point of view
[03:09:54] <PavelK> because if he will see that row nuber is incrementing then its just loading, when he sees spinner for a second, then it is different experience - it really depends on what you want to achieve :)
[03:10:14] <PavelK> but we are getting into ux now instead of performance of the script
[03:22:59] <daftspunk> random question, best mail client?
[03:24:11] <Birliban> PavelK, hmmm. ok, i like the spinner or progress bar best ;-)
[03:24:28] <Birliban> daftspunk, randowm answer: the thundering bird ;-)
[03:27:33] <daftspunk> Birliban: ty :)
[03:44:33] <daftspunk> next random question: best music player? (mp3s)
[03:45:18] <ravenzz> random troll answer: windows media player
[03:45:24] <astropirate> daftspunk, Windows media player
[03:45:28] <ravenzz> lol
[03:45:28] <astropirate> FUUUU ravenzz beat me!!!
[03:45:29] <daftspunk> bwahaha
[03:45:43] <daftspunk> do ppl still use winamp?
[03:45:52] <ravenzz> my father does
[03:46:12] <vishrayne> :)
[03:46:21] <timing> Hi all!
[03:46:43] <ravenzz> I don't know I listen to music from random sources, instead of buy/download it
[03:46:49] <daftspunk> its not itunes and u dont wanna admit it, is it?
[03:46:49] <ravenzz> so it is free and legal
[03:47:22] <timing> I'm using autocomplete with a js array like this: users = [{name: '', email: '', company: ''}, {/*other user*/}]. How can I use this array as source and specify the fields it has to search?
[03:48:18] <ravenzz> i think that it is described on the doc?!
[03:48:37] <daftspunk> with examples
[03:49:15] <astropirate> I listen to classical music. VERY few new good pieces come out. No reason for me to buy music :)
[03:49:32] <ravenzz> ahah
[03:49:45] <daftspunk> timing: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+ui+autocomplete&l=1
[03:49:47] <timing> ravenzz: cannot find it
[03:49:50] <ravenzz> yeah classical music is cool because you can find CDs for $5
[03:49:55] <daftspunk> timing: click "View Source"
[03:50:14] <timing> hehe funny site
[03:50:17] <daftspunk> damn trolls
[03:50:21] <timing> but i'm already at that page orcourse
[03:50:27] <daftspunk> itunes it is then
[03:50:31] <timing> it searches in a flat array
[03:50:35] <timing> I have an array of objects
[03:50:48] <ravenzz> can't you convert it to an array?
[03:50:51] <ravenzz> ?makearray
[03:50:52] <bot-t> jQuery.makeArray(obj): Convert an array-like object into a true JavaScript array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[03:51:05] <timing> ?
[03:51:48] <daftspunk> merge them together first... array = $.makeArray($.merge(true, object1, object2, object3));
[03:52:05] <daftspunk> $.extend rather
[03:53:13] <timing> so when I create the array like this, it works? [['John', 'Doe'], ['Jan', 'Modaal']];
[03:53:38] <astropirate> timing, for sure
[03:53:45] <timing> nice, didn't know that
[03:53:53] <timing> and it's not in the doc, so don't blame me
[03:54:04] <timing> Hmm
[03:54:07] <timing> it's supposed to work:
[03:54:07] <timing> An Array of Objects with label and value properties:
[03:54:08] <timing> [ { label: "Choice1", value: "value1" }, ... ]
[03:54:30] <timing> I will search further, thanks
[03:54:54] <astropirate> good luck
[03:59:24] <shwaiil> hi
[04:00:30] <shwaiil> Q: How to get the val of scrollY ? I've got the following http://jsfiddle.net/hFKdW/ I'm just doing $(window).scrollY, because when console.log( $(window) ); I can see the atribute, but while accessing I get this error. So, I've probably skipped something on the basics and I've carried with me. Can someone explain me what's happening ? Thank you
[04:01:58] <faraway> shwaiil: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[04:02:48] <shwaiil> faraway: tks for looking, but why isn't it working ? What I really want to know is why I can't access "scrollY" if I can see it on the console ?! :T
[04:04:17] <faraway> shwaiil: cause is a property of window object and not of the jquery object
[04:04:55] <shwaiil> faraway: is there a way to access it ?
[04:05:02] <shwaiil> I wont do it, but just to understand
[04:06:04] <faraway> shwaiil: directly access it from the window object and not from the query object !?
[04:06:17] <shwaiil> faraway: oh ok
[04:11:42] * kborchers glares back at gnarf :P
[04:12:13] <omolio> can I use custom post formats?
[04:20:13] <faraway> omolio: what do you mean with custom post format ? not in multipart/form-data ?
[04:20:45] <omolio> faraway: http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats
[04:21:36] <faraway> omolio: ok ..  can't help you there
[04:36:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Totally related to this channel: What music is best for concentrating while programming? I prefer Blues Brothers or things in languages I don't understand
[04:38:18] <stagen> Heh, I prefer upbeat music like dubstep.
[04:39:26] <Eartz> Trance or Dnb :)
[04:40:56] <faraway> totally agree to Eartz :D
[04:41:29] <amit_usual> is there a way to know that whether a request was from inside an iframe or a normal request
[04:43:26] <gyaresu> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9924296/how-can-i-use-jquery-or-javascript-inside-a-google-maps-infowindow Halp!
[04:57:31] <Entomo> ChrisTheSorcerer, anything loud and fast with no words.  Shoutcast has a bunch of stations that I've streamed to disk and put on CD.  Hours of programming concentration.  Trance works well, as Eartz said.
[04:58:05] <Entomo> Also, oddly, Erasure works well for me.  No idea why - usually when there's words I get distracted.
[05:00:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> IKR, Erasure has a soothing voice and it's the perfect programming music
[05:00:38] <Gaia> Hey guys, im using the jquery mobile page transition on dynamic pages
[05:00:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> except Always... too many "memories" and I almost always (*no pun intended*) burst out into a chairdance
[05:00:48] <Gaia> But its not working :[
[05:00:53] <Gaia> Anyone?
[05:02:59] <Jon47> this is the best for programming: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPoqNeR3_UA
[05:03:15] <IRJUN_FEROCI> hi all I met a web application that is making use of jquery 1.2,1.4 and 1.7 im new to javascript ajax etc but does this smell fishy to you? Why would one have a web application using different versions ?
[05:03:38] <Jon47> IRJUN_FEROCI: yeah that's a really terrible practice
[05:04:36] <IRJUN_FEROCI> Ok so lets say I attempt to fix this and make it use the latest version is this possible or different version expose different functionality?
[05:04:54] <Jon47> it should be fixable
[05:05:02] <IRJUN_FEROCI> so its backward compatibility i guess
[05:05:09] <Xotix> easy
[05:05:10] <Jon47> jquery has begun to move towrads deprecating some old APIs
[05:05:18] <Jon47> but in 1.7, so far, they haven't (i believe)
[05:05:18] <Gaia> but it isnt wrking :[ why
[05:05:25] <Xotix> ups
[05:05:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> It's not the proper practice, but with some packs you have no choice. If a later version depricated something you really needed, you would need to use both. Thou jquery is rather good at keeping functionality through versions. I'm using kinetic for canvas handling and that one depricates functions without adding any replacements, so I have to use 3 different versions of that one >.<
[05:06:06] <IRJUN_FEROCI> thats terrible chris :<
[05:06:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> IKR, but well... fortunately there's not that much conflict between versions, so there's no big change if you use more than one version
[05:06:58] <Jon47> IRJUN_FEROCI: probably each version of jquery has a different, non-conflicting name in the global namespace, so probably the hardest part will be sorting all that out
[05:07:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> the annoying part is when you run with the image plugin and the 1.8.x of kinetic, that causes many problems with properties, but there's workarounds for that
[05:07:38] <IRJUN_FEROCI> yea true but using a single version which is latest seems more elegant
[05:07:45] <Jon47> i haven't used Kinetic but jquery has been really good about backwards-compatibility, and they are loudly broadcasting future deprecations way in advance
[05:09:40] <Xotix> if i have class="foo_22 bar" and 22 is variable but foo_ is static. How can i get foo_22 without bar or any oder additional classes?
[05:11:15] <Jon47> Xotix are you actually using those class names to select those elements (in js or css?)
[05:11:30] <Jon47> if the answer is no, I'd recommend using data-* attribtues to store data about the element
[05:11:39] <Jon47> rather than embedding it in the className
[05:13:42] <Xotix> Jon47 I'm having doctype 4.1 since it is a very old application. Data is html5, isn't it? should i still use it?
[05:13:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> If it's an identifying mark, I'd go with id-tag instead. I have an application with a bunch of product images, I use the article number as ID on each div, while their class names remain the same for each of them, just to be able to call on different functions for each individual one without losing the ability to style them the same
[05:15:57] <SVetter> hi guys
[05:16:02] <nacrotic> hello, i'm looking for help on IE6 to 8 compatibility for .attr() method. Someone can help me ?
[05:16:28] <Xotix> ChrisTheSorcerer: thanks for that input
[05:16:39] <Jon47> Xotix yeah data-attribs might be invalid in 4.1.  You could always write your own "getDataFromClassName" jquery plugin to use string functions to parse the className (stored as one long string with spaces in it) for the key "foo" and extract the value (the string after the underscore - in this case 22)
[05:16:51] <jh1> i want to add or change the wmode of a iframe src to wmode=opaque . is there a jquery method to do this?
[05:17:16] <Xotix> nacrotic why are you supporting ie6?
[05:17:24] <jh1> so if it already has a wmode i need to change it, of not i need to add it with & oder ?
[05:17:48] <Xotix> Jon47 i could hmm. anyway thanks!
[05:17:55] <nacrotic> xotix, beacaus i'm in training periode and i haven't choice
[05:18:11] <Jon47> jh1 does this answer it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4050999/youtube-iframe-wmode-issue
[05:18:24] <SVetter> I have a question: I have set up a form, that is submitted via ajax, variables are sent to another php file and processed there, and the  response comes back into my jquery script. The result is displayed using the .html("...") command. now is it possible to get some PHP code into that .html("...") line?
[05:18:31] <Jon47>  don't think wmode is an inherent attribute of iframes
[05:18:57] <Jon47> maybe it is something for flash
[05:18:57] <SVetter> because I have a dynamically filled <select> element, that is supposed to show up
[05:19:25] <nacrotic> xotix: but the troble is same on IE7 en IE8 (work fine with IE9)
[05:19:31] <SVetter> but if I write <?php .... ?> into it, nothing is displayed
[05:19:43] <Jon47> nacrotic what is the problem with .attr?  i thought it worked in IE6 just fine
[05:20:18] <Jon47> Svetter - the browser can't prase php code, only the server can do that
[05:20:46] <Jon47> you can get the server to do some php on the backend before returning the response to your ajax call though
[05:20:46] <nacrotic> Jon47, in my case : (http://pastebin.me/b71e4eb1b0cebb7a8cc7f8cbc600c4d1 line 165 to 175) attr is show as undefined
[05:21:24] <SVetter> okay, but if I have a set of say 5 values that are supposed to show up in the <select> form
[05:21:42] <SVetter> how would I replace the work the 'foreach' loop does for me in PHP?
[05:21:52] <SVetter> ow
[05:21:59] <SVetter> just answered my own question :D
[05:22:03] <SVetter> me = rooky
[05:22:04] <SVetter> hehhe
[05:22:05] <Jon47> nacrotic cmon dude, i don't want to debug 300 lines of js, show us the issue in a concise fiddle please
[05:22:15] <Xotix> nacrotic then the id doesn't exist probably
[05:24:51] <jh1> Jon47: Yeah, thats what i am trying to do. But for example if the domain is youtube.com/embed/12345567 i need to add the wmode with a ? but if its youtube.com/embed/12345567?referer=foo.bar i need to add it with a &
[05:25:31] <jh1> so i need to know if there is a method or plugin, that makes the handling of the url variables nicer
[05:26:30] <nacrotic> ok Jon47, shorter code here : http://pastebin.me/b71e4eb1b0cebb7a8cc7f8cbc6036ede. Xotix, i went to check th class .graph is set
[05:27:30] <Xotix> nacrotic you are getting the id, not the class at line 165
[05:28:16] <nacrotic> id is set too
[05:29:47] <Xotix> maybe at the time he is trying to get it, it isn'. Maybe selector's wrong. Debug it, it's hard to help from nothing.
[05:30:14] <SVetter> and another (probably rooky) question: if I use the .html command, does it replace everything else in the selected item? or does it add it?
[05:30:56] <nacrotic> sorry Xotix, my fault id is not set wen IE execute this part of code. Thank for your help
[05:31:00] <Xotix> SVetter http://api.jquery.com/html/ try it out  read the examples
[05:31:10] <SVetter> thx
[05:32:25] <Xotix> necrotic np didn't do a lot SVetter always read manual and search google also search stackoverflow.com. most things are covered very nice there
[05:34:13] <brettster> Hey guys - I'm looking for a way to, with jquery extend the height of sidebar div to the height of my content div
[05:34:20] <brettster> so if my content div grows
[05:34:27] <brettster> then my sidebar div will grow with it.
[05:34:47] <brettster> I know I could probably accomplish this with css but it just seems a bit hackyy
[05:35:21] <jh1> brettster: i link live can help yout http://api.jquery.com/live/
[05:35:34] <jh1> s/link/think
[05:35:45] <Xotix> brettster: live is deprecated use on
[05:36:02] <Xotix> in jquery 1.7
[05:36:48] <brettster> can't seem to find .on()
[05:36:58] <brettster> ah
[05:36:59] <brettster> found it
[05:37:03] <brettster> this should do what I need?
[05:37:40] <brettster> i notice this is all on click
[05:37:51] <Jon47> brettster you can pass any event to it
[05:38:03] <Jon47> click is probably just used in the examples because it's convenient
[05:38:05] <brettster> i need it to grab the height of my sidebar div and equal it to the height of the main div
[05:38:11] <brettster> hm
[05:38:15] <brettster> i'll try to figure it out
[05:38:29] <Jon47> brettster can't you accomplish this using only css?
[05:38:50] <brettster> If I put my  sidebar inside the main content div then yes
[05:39:00] <brettster> but it just really doesn't look good symantically
[05:39:07] <Eartz> I guess you need to write a function called 'resizeColumn' for example, and to call it when your main div changes
[05:39:13] <Gaia> Hey guys, how can i make it that my menubar always stays on top of the screen?
[05:39:19] <Jon47> why not put both of them inside a container with no semantics, like a div
[05:39:34] <Xotix> Gaia  position fixed css
[05:39:52] <Gaia> That if you scroll down a page tat it stays on top
[05:40:01] <Gaia> only fixed? :O no jquery?
[05:40:20] <Xotix> Gaia yes
[05:40:36] <Gaia> aits thnx
[05:40:39] <Gaia> lets see
[05:42:36] <Gaia> andddeeee
[05:42:50] <Gaia> is there a way to remove my urlbar in mobile browsers?
[05:43:20] <jh1> is there a nice way to make a regex to a string? so that the \ are double and the / at the end and the beginning are deleted?
[05:43:38] <Jon47> Gaia no that would be a grievous violation of the UI
[05:43:41] <sh_sh> when i have a list of similiar dom elements, how can i get a list of the value of a certain attribute those all share?
[05:44:14] <Gaia> orly?
[05:44:15] <Jon47> sh_sh .each and build the array yourself?
[05:44:15] <sh_sh> like i have a list of 300 checkboxes, all with a different name attribute. And I want a list of those names
[05:44:40] <sh_sh> Jon47: yeah sure but i thought there is a better approach in jquery
[05:44:43] <Gaia> Jon47 , www.interdirectnetwork.com , could you open that on your smartphone for me?
[05:44:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Gaia, you can only remove the URL-bar on your own mobile browser, but that mostly includes jailbreaking and modding the hardcoded bits of the browser ;)
[05:44:50] <Gaia> they are like hiding it
[05:45:09] <Gaia> removing, hiding , same sheize
[05:45:09] <Gaia> :P
[05:46:11] <Jon47> Gaia yeah I see that
[05:46:21] <Jon47> i guess it's possible!
[05:46:25] <Jon47> i wouldn't recommend it though
[05:46:37] <Jon47> personally i find it annoying when a site has an inconsistent UI
[05:46:59] <Jon47> they aren't hiding it compeltely though
[05:47:05] <Jon47> you can still scroll back up to get it back
[05:47:14] <Jon47> if you click the top of the page
[05:47:19] <Gaia> yeah true, but the initial state is hide
[05:47:34] <Gaia> since im using a fixed header
[05:47:46] <Gaia> it would be nice that the initial state would be hide
[05:48:04] <Jon47> i guess if you're obligated to get this done as part of a contract, then I wish you luck, but if you're only doing it because you think it looks good, then I'd like to convince you that it does not look good and is bad UI
[05:49:04] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Gaia: The default browser on android gingerbread has an easy sollution for that... Scroll down half a step and the URL-bar is gone :P
[06:11:51] <eworbit> any jquery freelancers?
[06:12:47] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to include a variable in a url, but it doesn't seem to work too well, what have I done wrong here: url:"/matrix/ajax/update/product/"+productId"/stock/"+jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text()+attributeSet
[06:12:48] <fRAiLtY-> +productId is the var. Then I need to append the rest of the URL, "/stock/" to it
[06:12:52] <Misiur> Hi guys. Let's say I have simple ul with 4 elements
[06:14:01] <rroelofs> fRAiLtY-: depending on the contents of productid you might have to escape it.
[06:14:11] <fRAiLtY-> rroelofs: It's a number
[06:14:13] <rroelofs> otherwise make sure it contains what you think it does
[06:14:27] <fRAiLtY-> I've just checked by echo'ing it, it contains 301 in this instance
[06:14:37] <rroelofs> you are missing a + after
[06:15:57] <rroelofs> it should be ".../" + productid + "/stock..."
[06:16:06] <fRAiLtY-> rroelofs: Jeez… must be friday
[06:16:06] <fRAiLtY-> Cheers
[06:16:18] <rroelofs> It is where i am :-)
[06:16:30] <fRAiLtY-> Hehe, with questions like that, I'm glad it is too!
[06:16:36] <fRAiLtY-> Think my brains turned off already
[06:17:00] <rroelofs> Misiur:  ??
[06:19:42] <davetarmac> hi guys
[06:20:17] <davetarmac> I'm going to go out on a limb and say I can't do this: $('#wrapper a').text('<img src="bg-pause.png" alt="Pause" />');
[06:20:35] <aaronmcadam> html
[06:20:43] <aaronmcadam> or append
[06:20:50] <PavelK> ?jquery.html @ davetarmac
[06:20:50] <aaronmcadam> append it is
[06:20:51] <bot-t> davetarmac, .html() - Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[06:21:06] <PavelK> hmm
[06:21:29] <PavelK> full docs are much more useful :)
[06:21:37] <aaronmcadam> aye
[06:21:41] <davetarmac> and that will change the contents of the <a>change this</a> to <img / >
[06:21:47] <PavelK> anyway, you can set html inside by $.html
[06:22:14] <aaronmcadam> do u want to replace the a ?
[06:22:22] <davetarmac> I want to keep the <a>
[06:22:25] <aaronmcadam> ?append
[06:22:26] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:22:32] <davetarmac> but change the current text from 'Pause' to an image
[06:23:11] <PavelK> if you dont want to change insidehtml, you can always switch css classes to hide/show specific content :)
[06:23:12] <aaronmcadam> $('#wrapper a').replaceWith('<a><img src="bg-pause.png" alt="Pause" /></a>');
[06:23:14] <fRAiLtY-> on page load, #matrix-container has content in, this code: http://pastie.org/3697781 replaces that code with fresh data depending on a drop-down, how do I add a loading image (already have) to show in-between the ajax request as there's a 1sec or so pause.
[06:24:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi guys, I have a table row with a certain ID... in this row is a td with a link.... When this link is clicked, it should append a row AFTER the row of the id which was clicked
[06:25:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone has any clue if this is possible without using the table id, but only the row id?
[06:25:27] <aaronmcadam> yup
[06:25:34] <aaronmcadam> you'd want to use closest
[06:25:40] <aaronmcadam> to get back up to the row
[06:25:42] <PavelK> i think it is even easier with row id than table id :)
[06:25:47] <aaronmcadam> and then use next()
[06:25:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I use this now: $('#' + params.id).closest('tr').after(returndata);
[06:26:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> do you have an example with closest?
[06:26:26] <aaronmcadam> that looks good
[06:26:30] <PavelK> closest is pretty selfexplanatory :D
[06:26:34] <aaronmcadam> ?closest @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[06:26:34] <bot-t> ecky--ptang-zoob, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:26:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the returndata is a row
[06:26:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it appends it two times!
[06:27:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It's driving me nuts
[06:27:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> as if i click the link 2 times
[06:27:11] <aaronmcadam> heh that's annoying
[06:27:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can i show you my js code i have?
[06:27:32] <aaronmcadam> ya gotta be careful you're not cloning it
[06:27:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it totally looks like cloning!
[06:28:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> this is what i have: http://pastebin.com/SB8pRCVV
[06:28:23] <PavelK> so check if returndata is correct
[06:28:35] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle or jsbin
[06:28:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> return data just echos one row with stuff in it
[06:29:01] <fRAiLtY-> What's the correct way of formatting this: jQuery("#matrix-container").empty().html('<img src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/sampleimage.jpg') ?>" />'); ?
[06:29:05] <zulu-gula> how to call script from remote server on ajax loaded content ?
[06:29:12] <fRAiLtY-> So the the PHP marks etc don't get upset
[06:29:15] <PavelK> well, im talking about this "stuff in it" - may be it is just the same as previous row content?
[06:30:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the php file just says: echo "<tr><td>test</td></tr>";
[06:31:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the problem is i can't check the html source code with content that was added with jquery
[06:31:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> msgview... might you be doing a script that's supposed to "unhide" a message? Because there are easier ways to do taht ;)
[06:32:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes, but the message gets fetched from DB once it gets unhided
[06:32:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so I need a php script to append the right data
[06:32:47] <Woet> is there any jquery plugin the providers a select functionally by dragging a box like on your desktop? example: http://i.imgur.com/A5kMf.png
[06:33:20] <PavelK> http://jsfiddle.net/pavelloz/h4T95/1/
[06:33:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> So make a div, fetch the message, without any HTML formatting, from the DB and fill the div from the ajax instead of the PHP. Then you'll make the div hidden as standard and when the function in AJAX is executed, toggle the div
[06:33:25] <PavelK> seems to work with a simple demo
[06:34:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, so this: $('#' + params.id).closest('tr').after(returndata); actually already appends a row?
[06:34:20] <PavelK> yep
[06:34:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aah
[06:34:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i got it now, thanks, you're smart! :)
[06:34:51] <ChrisTheSorcerer> document.getElementById('TheDiv').innerHTML = "<p>" + returndata + "</p>"; ??
[06:34:57] <PavelK> well i just copied your code to jsfiddel :p
[06:35:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> been struggling with this stupid problem for 5 hours
[06:35:06] <PavelK> but ur welcome
[06:36:18] <fRAiLtY-> What's the correct way of formatting this: jQuery("#matrix-container").empty().html('<img src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/sampleimage.jpg') ?>" />'); So the the PHP marks etc don't get upset
[06:36:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but should i not do this then? after("<tr><td>" + returndata + "</td></tr>");
[06:37:25] <PavelK> well, its more elegant :)
[06:37:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i don't know if i should add the tr and td in the "after" function
[06:38:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if after() already makes a row .
[06:39:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $('#' + params.id).closest('tr').after("test"); - does this put test inside a <tr><td></td></tr> ?
[06:40:33] <thomb> i want to report an error during an ajax request. i think about raising an header message, but which error code should i use?
[06:41:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> got it working finally
[06:43:29] <killer11> http://www.ecelab.com/circuit-astable-555.htm
[06:44:23] <killer11> didnt mean to paste that
[06:45:35] <VictorCL> hi I am in a complex problem xD
[06:45:41] <VictorCL> I have this background image changer
[06:45:43] <VictorCL> it works fine
[06:45:43] <VictorCL> $('html,body#main_bg_projecte').css("background-image",newimage);
[06:45:52] <VictorCL> but I need to give it some effect . like slide or fadeout
[06:45:56] <VictorCL> how can I accomplish  that?
[06:47:32] <faraway> VictorCL: http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/backgroundPosition/
[06:48:22] <faraway> VictorCL: for fading i don't know if there is something that could work in all browsers with "background-image" only
[06:49:46] <VictorCL> ok thanks
[06:50:36] <rroelofs> fRAiLtY-: did you get an answer?  the php is procssed before the js even sees it, you might need to wrap you php var in {} to get it to evaluate correctly
[06:52:15] <faraway> VictorCL: probably you could do it with a div that holds the background image with absolute position width and height 100% and a negative z-index but not sure if this will work
[06:52:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there any way to make sure that if you upload a javascript file that users automatically receive that updated file instead of a cached version
[06:55:25] <thomb> let me explain my problem: i want to call a php script via ajax. the php script has to report an error, and the html file shall alert that error via jquery. what do i have to trigger?
[06:55:30] <eworbit> ecky: you can put a ?ver=1.0 after the javacsript filename
[06:55:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> eworbit, but then it never gets cached?
[06:55:54] <eworbit> ecky: and bump up the version number each time you change the file
[06:56:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah ok
[06:56:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[06:56:26] <nacrotic> does jquery permit make syncronous request (without $.ajax({async: false}) ) ?
[06:56:28] <overbythere> drupal, when you hit "clear cache" just changes all css and javascript links to contain ?C or ?D
[06:56:34] <overbythere> going up to Z and back to A again
[06:56:38] <herbySk> hello, a quick question pls: is there some cleaner way to $("#foo").html("") or is this the idiom to clear the contents of a selector?
[06:57:03] <nacrotic> herbySk: .empty() i think
[06:57:15] <herbySk> narcotic: thanks
[06:57:56] <eworbit> speaking of empty, is there a way to remove a particular node?
[06:58:04] <Jon47> .remove
[06:58:06] <jh1> remove()
[06:58:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> with jquery, any answer is simple
[06:58:43] <eworbit> ahem, with out deleting it's inner nodes?
[06:59:03] <Jon47> eworbit .unwrap
[06:59:16] <jh1> $(selector).contents().unwrap()
[07:01:07] <Xotix> if i console.log a jquery obj and i get [] how do i check for that?
[07:04:12] <shamess> Xotix: What are you looking to check? When jquery has zero returned results for a selector?
[07:05:00] <eworbit> I have a <span> wrapping an <input>, I can't get it to .unwrap() the span
[07:05:15] <Xotix> shames isEmptyObject()
[07:05:20] <eworbit> or .unwrap() the input, getting rid of the span
[07:05:30] <shamess> Then check the .lenth
[07:05:44] <shamess> *.length
[07:06:27] <Xotix> shamess: thanks
[07:06:54] <shamess> console.log is a bit deceptive when dumping a jquery object. It *knows* it's a jquery object, so just shows you what you want to know - the selected elements.
[07:07:12] <shamess> But $('#blah') actually returns a jquery object, not "[]"
[07:07:35] <shamess> But the length will be zero if there's zero selected elements.
[07:11:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> eworbit: can the same be done for CSS files? (the version nr)
[07:15:42] <eworbit> ecky: no, I'm getting close.  I was using replaceWith: $("span", "#testdiv").replaceWith(function() { return this.innerHTML; });
[07:16:21] <eworbit> but I found out that you will unfortunately LOOSE the user input values if the innerHTML happens to have <inputs>
[07:17:01] <eworbit> so, unwrap() seem to preserve user inputs rather than replaceWidth/innherHTML method.
[07:22:37] <fRAiLtY-> What am I doing wrong here, trying to check the text value of the select, and if it matches echo something out, http://jsfiddle.net/R3Gew/2/
[07:24:19] <Eartz> fRAiLtY: why are you using .text ? you want to replace the select with text ?
[07:25:27] <Haprog> .text('foo') replaces the contents of the selected element with 'foo'
[07:25:41] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, no I just want to print text into the div #test
[07:25:46] <evasivx> Morning!
[07:25:50] <fRAiLtY-> <-- new to JS
[07:26:04] <Haprog> #test is a select the div is #container
[07:26:05] <Eartz> I guess what you want is http://jsfiddle.net/R3Gew/3/
[07:26:19] <niftylettuce> favorite JS date manipulation libraries?
[07:26:29] <niftylettuce> moment.js, datejs, what else?
[07:26:42] <DelTree> how do I set which <option> of a <select> is selected initially ?
[07:26:55] <fRAiLtY-> <-- twat
[07:26:57] <fRAiLtY-> Cheers
[07:27:00] <fRAiLtY-> What a stupid error
[07:27:03] <Haprog> :P
[07:27:07] <PavelK> btw. im looking for alternative to ( https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_jeditable/tree/master/js ) - editing content inline and saving it through ajax - any suggestions [from practice]? the one i pasted is from 5 years ago, I would like to use something more modern
[07:27:22] <Xotix> how can i wait for a function to finish? for proceeding? Kind of callback
[07:27:44] <Xotix> PavelK depends on your needs
[07:27:59] <Jon47> Xotix specify a callback ;)
[07:28:06] <Xotix> div contenteditable and $post and you have the most basic.
[07:28:08] <PavelK> well, i need to edit personal user data, some time dates, user bio
[07:28:09] <Woet> is there any jquery plugin the providers a select functionally by dragging a box like on your desktop? example: http://i.imgur.com/A5kMf.png
[07:28:15] <Haprog> PavelK: I've used that jeditable once or twice nad it worked well.
[07:28:19] <Haprog> *and
[07:28:29] <PavelK> mhm, any compability issues with 1.7+ ?
[07:28:35] <PavelK> *jquery 1.7+
[07:28:53] <Haprog> I think I used it with 1.6. not sure.
[07:28:58] <Haprog> just try it out :)
[07:29:22] <_druu> hey there! I need some creative help I guess… problem: a click-event receives a data object and opens modal box with data objects data, the close event of that modal object should be able to access the same data object now… any ideas on how to solve this?
[07:29:28] <PavelK> yea, i cant afford to spend 2 days on doing it to find out it failed on production :)
[07:29:53] <_druu> *modal box with that objects data
[07:29:59] <_druu> *object's
[07:32:08] <Haprog> _druu: you could just save the data to a global variable my_modal_data or something.
[07:32:26] <_druu> Haprog: fsck that was too easy :D thanks mate
[07:32:33] <Haprog> :P
[07:32:46] <Xotix> Jon47 liek the opposite of setTimeout. start function x, and after it was completed, wait x seconds.
[07:33:42] <PavelK> ah, what the hell, ill try jeditable its just so nice :)
[07:33:56] <Jon47> Xotix i think you just need to use the callback pattern - pass a function as a parameter to the function, and then call that function as the last command before the function closes
[07:34:17] <Jon47> function function function
[07:34:44] <brettster> hey guys
[07:34:57] <tapia> Hi
[07:35:08] <brettster> so this is what im using
[07:35:15] <brettster> and it's breaking my site in safari
[07:35:32] <Xotix> Jon47: hmm, no i want to stop the whole script.
[07:35:38] <fRAiLtY-> Here: http://pastie.org/3698190 on line 21 I need to get the value of attribute129 in the url, how so?
[07:35:46] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3698205
[07:36:00] <brettster> http://arcdc.net.s142783.gridserver.com/index.php/supported-employment/
[07:36:06] <brettster> and thats what it's doing in safari
[07:36:10] <brettster> if you take a look
[07:36:51] <Xotix> Jon47, it's about clicking a button and the ndo something. But the tool is old and got a lot of onclick=""  several general click  event's itself. Very ugly. and i need to make something, which takes some time and then change something before the other stuff comes.
[07:37:31] <Jon47> if you have complete control, you probably want to use promises/deferreds
[07:37:48] <tapia> I'm having a weird problem. I have a DIV with some <tr> and <td> inside of it:  http://pastebin.com/GSD0dBFu
[07:38:11] <Jon47> but there's no inherent way in javascript to bind a handler to execute when an arbitrary function finishes executing
[07:38:14] <tapia> but if I do something like this:
[07:38:24] <tapia>  filebrowser_row_template = $('#filebrowserrow').detach(); alert (filebrowser_row_template.html());
[07:38:34] <Xotix> Jon47: ok thx i'll ake a look at it
[07:38:39] <tapia> I get the content of the DIV, but without any <td> or <tr>
[07:38:51] <tapia> anyone knows why?
[07:39:38] <tapia> the result I get:
[07:39:39] <tapia> <a class="link"><i id="icon" class="icon"></i><span class="path"></span></a>SOMETHING<span class="date"></span>
[07:41:02] <tapia> some help, please?
[07:41:23] <jh1> http://i.imgur.com/IYNRg.png hehe
[07:41:29] <monk12> tapia, whats up?
[07:41:57] <Haprog> tapia: you can only have tr elements inside table, thead or tbody..
[07:42:05] <Eartz> jh1 : lol
[07:42:08] <Haprog> why do you have a div instead?
[07:42:11] <brettster> ANYONE?
[07:42:22] <manins> i have to add html table dynamiclly in jquery
[07:42:35] <AdvoWork> how come when you click a button in chrome, it goes like forward a page when I click it?
[07:43:31] <Xotix> Jon47: got it solved very easyily. Just returned false on my click and when my logic is done click it again. (after my logic runned once it won't run again). :P perfect but thanks
[07:43:50] <fALSO> Hi!
[07:44:07] <fALSO> alert($("input[@name=acao_id]:checked").val());
[07:44:31] <fALSO> how can i make this return the VALUE of the checked item of that input
[07:44:35] <Haprog> tapia: if that html is actually inside a <table> then seems like you should have <tr id="filebrowserrow"> instead and remove the div. tr must be a direct child of table, thead or tbody, same as td must be inside tr.
[07:44:45] <fALSO> and not the index of the selected one
[07:45:23] <Haprog> or if you don't want to have a real table you shouldn't use tr or td.
[07:45:38] <manins> how to add html tabledynamically in jquery<table><tr><th><td>orid</td><td>name</td></th></tr></table> but it will not repeat agin in row
[07:45:53] <tapia> Haprog, if I do it with <tr id="blabla">, after the detach() I get "null"
[07:46:06] <monk12> is there a way to unbind a function. like 'blur.mask', then re-addit later.
[07:46:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Is there any short command to make the last 45 minutes of the last working day of the week go faster?
[07:46:15] <tapia> filebrowser_row_template = $('#filebrowserrow').detach(); alert (filebrowser_row_template.html());
[07:46:18] <monk12> (i want to store the function before i unbind it.)
[07:46:20] <Haprog> tapia: could you put your example on jsfiddle?
[07:46:23] <hurry> hi, i have jCrop, and i show the image that i create when i click on button. for first time i see the correct image, if i re-take image, i see the old picture, but in server i save the correct image...how can i resolve that?
[07:46:24] <tapia> the result of the alert is "null"
[07:46:39] <jh1> ChrisTheSorcerer: kickerbattle!
[07:47:02] <Haprog> monk12: just save it in a variable
[07:47:03] <brettster> jon47 are you there
[07:47:11] <Jon47> yes
[07:47:11] <rroelofs> hurry: you may have to do cache busting to get the browser to re fetch
[07:47:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> hurry: imageName.onload(function{ do whatever you want });
[07:47:49] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I get that all the time, it's because it draws the image before it's loaded
[07:47:50] <hurry> i can use something like live or .on ?
[07:48:02] <monk12> Haprog, think I got it... i can access it from $('myelem').data("events").blur[x]
[07:48:06] <monk12> thanks!
[07:48:13] <Jon47> brettster: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[07:48:20] <rroelofs> hurry: no.  append an extra parameter to the url that gets the image
[07:48:28] <brettster> what line?
[07:48:37] <brettster> of what script
[07:48:40] <rroelofs> maybe current time or smoething.  the server can ignore it
[07:48:42] <brettster> it's only a safari issue
[07:48:51] <hurry> rroelofs: a new image name?
[07:48:54] <hurry> anytime?
[07:48:55] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sorry, correct one should be Image.onload = function() {	draw your image });
[07:49:25] <hurry> ChrisTheSorcerer:  for me?
[07:49:34] <ChrisTheSorcerer> yeah
[07:49:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> without the ");" of course >.<
[07:49:54] <rroelofs> hurry` I'm talking about the src attribute
[07:50:18] <brettster> yeah
[07:50:19] <brettster> fixed it
[07:50:21] <brettster> that wasnt it
[07:50:32] <tapia> Haprog, there is a simplified sample: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/
[07:50:35] <manins> how to add html tabledynamically in jquery<table><tr><th><td>orid</td><td>name</td></th></tr></table> but it will not repeat agin in row
[07:50:57] <Jon47> brettster:  webkit is like, by far the easiest browser to debug
[07:51:13] <tapia> Haprog, sorry, there is a bug :-)
[07:51:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, I'm heading out early today!
[07:51:20] <brettster> yeah
[07:51:21] <Haprog> manins: I don't understand what you're saying. if you just need to add some html you can use .append()/prepend()/html()/after()/before() with html parameter.
[07:51:25] <brettster> i just fixed the error
[07:51:25] <ChrisTheSorcerer> See ya next time
[07:51:30] <brettster> but i'm still having the problem
[07:51:52] <hurry> ok thanks guys
[07:51:55] <brettster> it's creating some weird issue with a float
[07:52:00] <brettster> like it's not clearing
[07:52:10] <Xotix> can i replace the onclick of a button? inline onclick.
[07:52:12] <tapia> Haprog, try this one: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/1/
[07:53:51] <Haprog> tapia: you have the code wrong. this is how you should use jsfiddle. jQuery is selected on the left. then have JS and HTML in their own boxes: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/3/
[07:53:57] <Woet> is there any jquery plugin the providers a select functionally by dragging a box like on your desktop? example: http://i.imgur.com/A5kMf.png
[07:54:10] <Woet> Haprog / tapia: www.jqfiddle.com
[07:54:43] <tapia> Haprog, ok. Try this one: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/5/
[07:54:53] <fALSO> anyone knows why this returns the INDEX of the element instead of the value of the element
[07:54:59] <fALSO> alert($("input[@name=acao_id]:checked").val());
[07:55:11] <fALSO> am i doing anything wrong ?
[07:55:16] <brettster> jon47!
[07:55:27] <Haprog> tapia: you don't need document ready as it can be selected from the left and is wrapped by jsfiddle
[07:55:45] <tapia> Ok, ok
[07:55:57] <Haprog> and no need to include html and body tags
[07:56:07] <Jon47> brettster: i can't help right now, i'm sorry, but my advice remains the same - address the issue with CSS, not JS
[07:56:12] <fALSO> anyone  ?
[07:56:27] <tapia> all right, but do you see the problem I'm having with detach() ? :-)
[07:57:05] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise whether there's a more lightweight/tidy/more efficient way of doing this code: http://pastie.org/3698317
[07:57:12] <fRAiLtY-> I want everything to be as quick and tidy as possible
[07:57:12] <Whirl3d> fALSO, create a fiddle that reproduces the problem and we can check it out
[07:57:14] <fRAiLtY-> Whilst it works
[07:57:15] <Haprog> tapia: as I said, you can't have tr or td without table. see: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/8/
[07:58:10] <brettster> actually
[07:58:21] <tapia> Haprog the content of the <div> is gonna be used by a template system, inside a table
[07:58:23] <brettster> it's applying a height of 808 to the divs in firefox
[07:58:29] <brettster> and of 612 or something and safari
[07:58:29] <tapia> that's why I do the detach()
[07:58:32] <brettster> why the difference
[07:58:51] <tapia> but jquery removes the tds and trs
[07:59:07] <Haprog> tapia: then you should only be dealing with reading and writing it as HTML string and not use detach()
[07:59:10] <Haprog> I guess
[07:59:32] <AdvoWork> how come when you click a button in chrome, it goes like forward a page when I click it?
[07:59:36] <tapia> The problem is not with the detach(), but with the $() selector
[08:00:07] <tapia> If I just do this:
[08:00:08] <tapia> filebrowser_row_template = $('#filebrowserrow'); alert (filebrowser_row_template.html());
[08:00:11] <tapia> the result is the same
[08:01:15] <Haprog> tapia: it's because the browser removes the tr and td elements because they aren't allowed outside a table
[08:01:18] <brettster> could anyone kindly tell me
[08:01:25] <brettster> why this is applying two different heights
[08:01:25] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3698205
[08:01:28] <brettster> in firefox
[08:01:30] <brettster> and in safari
[08:01:56] <Haprog> tapia: you need to store the template in string or other format. not in the actual DOM if it isn't valid.
[08:02:29] <Xotix> can i do setTimeout(function() {}, 500=?
[08:02:43] <Haprog> tapia: wait I think I'll have a solution for you..
[08:03:28] <tapia> Haprog, it would be great :-) :-)
[08:03:50] <Haprog> tapia: see this: http://jsfiddle.net/8QERv/9/
[08:04:51] <tapia> wooooo
[08:04:55] <Haprog> when it's in a script tag it isn't put in the dom and because the type isn't javascript it isn't parsed as javascript either so you can use it as is.
[08:04:59] <tapia> looks great
[08:05:01] <tapia> let me try
[08:05:13] <Haprog> I use that with Mustache templates and Mustache.js
[08:05:43] <Haprog> you should checkout: http://mustache.github.com/ and https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
[08:06:36] <tapia> Haprog, I'm using Transparency.js
[08:06:42] <tapia> http://leonidas.github.com/transparency/
[08:06:57] <hurry> rroelofs: i add " . time() . " to name image with php. Thanks a lot
[08:07:08] <Haprog> tapia: ok, I'll check it out
[08:07:33] <Haprog> tapia: seems very similar to mustache.js
[08:08:18] <Haprog> I like Mustache more though
[08:09:18] <Haprog> there's also Handlebars with more functionality
[08:12:09] <davidw> hi dudes - any pointers on what the difference is between doing canvasElement.width(100) and canvasElement.attr('width', '100px') ? they behave very differently.
[08:12:59] <thang> davidw: when you call width, it changes the width in css
[08:13:07] <Raverix> One sets tha attribute, one is CSS
[08:13:14] <dmsuperman> http://api.jquery.com/width/
[08:13:15] <Raverix> <canvas width="100">
[08:13:24] <Raverix> vs <canvas style='width:100px'>
[08:13:29] <jklmnop> does anyone know why i can't use getElementsByTagName('head') on an iframe in IE when i'm using el.contentWindow.document? it's length returns 0 even though there should be something there.
[08:14:03] <davidw> thang, Raverix I get the superficial differences, but don't understand the different behavior
[08:14:34] <Raverix> Inspect the element in chrome / firefox and take a look under the hood ;)
[08:14:48] <davidw> in my (inherited) code, setting the attribute works, but setting .width() does not
[08:14:56] <Haprog> davidw: when you use attr or actually specify attribute width="x" you shouldn't use "px" suffix
[08:15:03] <davidw> Raverix, I have been, but I think there's some kind of theoreticaly point that I'm missing
[08:15:21] <davidw> Haprog, with .width() you can just pass it a number, which is nice
[08:15:42] <davidw> with .attr, I think you need to pass it 'px' in some cases (IE?)
[08:15:49] <davidw> at least my inherited code did that
[08:15:57] <thang> davidw: is the width attr being declared before you try to change it?
[08:17:06] <Haprog> davidw: I don't think it's valid to supply px with width and height attributes
[08:17:15] <Haprog> but it may work
[08:17:41] <Haprog> in CSS you need px but jQuery.width() works also without it
[08:18:23] <davidw> yeah, ideally I'd use .width() because it's cleaner, x-platform, etc...
[08:18:37] <davidw> but it's got to actually work:-)
[08:18:49] <tapia> Haprog, it works, thank you very much!!!!
[08:19:05] <lduros> $.inArray -- is there a way to know if an object that contains a value for a certain property is in the array, like: $.inArray('value', arr.propertyName)?
[08:19:06] <Haprog> I don't know why you'd want to change width with attr
[08:19:28] <lduros> or do i have to loop for that
[08:19:29] <Haprog> just use .css('width', value) or .width(value)
[08:19:29] <lduros> :-)
[08:19:39] <Haprog> tapia: np
[08:19:41] <dmsuperman> lduros: you could just do prop in obj
[08:19:49] <dmsuperman> if('key' in {key:5})
[08:20:16] <lduros> dmsuperman: but prop in obj checks that the property exist?
[08:20:17] <lduros> no?
[08:20:23] <lduros> dmsuperman: ah ok
[08:20:28] <dmsuperman> yeah isn't that what you want?
[08:20:31] <dmsuperman> or am I mistaken
[08:20:43] <dmsuperman> ohhhhh I see
[08:20:46] <Haprog> davidw: how do they behave differently?
[08:20:47] <dmsuperman> you have a collection of objects
[08:20:55] <lduros> I want to know that 'val' is the value assigned to one property of objects in an array
[08:21:00] <lduros> dmsuperman: yes
[08:21:09] <lduros> i guess underscore does that
[08:21:13] <lduros> or I can just loop
[08:21:17] <dmsuperman> Don't know about any one-liners for it
[08:21:17] <davidw> Haprog, the .attr actually makes the canvas take up the full screen like it's supposed to
[08:21:20] <dmsuperman> I imagine a loop is best
[08:21:41] <davidw> Haprog, .width leaves the thing small and in the corner
[08:21:48] <lduros> for (var i = 0; i > arr.length; i++) { if (arr[i].prop = val) { return true } }
[08:21:50] <davidw> maybe something else is overriding it somewhere....
[08:21:58] <Haprog> davidw: could you show it in a fiddle?
[08:22:01] <lduros> dmsuperman: as above.. not very expensive to write
[08:22:02] <lduros> :-)
[08:22:10] <Haprog> davidw: what value are you setting it to?
[08:22:17] <lduros> of course = should be ===
[08:22:18] <Haprog> 100px as you said? O.o
[08:22:20] <lduros> or ==
[08:22:27] <davidw> Haprog, no, there's too much code... I'll go experiment some more I think
[08:22:48] <monk12> So i have an issue with event ordering i believe: not sure what a good solution would be...  my non-ajax webapp is fine, cause the events are added in the order i want. But for my ajax app, the events are added separately since the elements are dynamically gotten. so forexample i add a masked input to a field, by checking onFocus: http://jsfiddle.net/armyofda12mnkeys/9DGgF/   (but when user types invalid (215)-###-####, i expext masked input to clear it out b
[08:22:48] <monk12> efore my code which doesnt happen). any ideas?
[08:22:50] <dmsuperman> lduros: exactly. I would make that a function and re-use it if I were you ;)
[08:22:52] <esiegel> Hey everyone, I'm trying to create a script that add position:fixed to the css of an element when a user scrolls to (and past) the element. Is there a best practice for doing this? I've seen and played around with waypoints.js, but in Safari the element doesn't scroll down properly. (This is a what I see in the inspector: http://i.imgur.com/NyMgu.png).
[08:22:52] <ircjsbot> esiegel, sorry, I have never seen and.
[08:23:02] <esiegel> Thanks!
[08:23:40] <dmsuperman> lduros: aha, there may be something after all: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[08:23:54] <Haprog> davidw: maybe you have some overlapping css and attributes and one of them takes precedence?
[08:23:57] <lduros> dmsuperman: i did:     isInObjectCollection =  function (arr, searchValue, property) { } but mayeb it would be better to add that to the Array object prototype?
[08:24:04] <davidw> Haprog, could be...
[08:24:07] <monk12> (Typing (215)-###-#### shouldnt populate dayphone since its invalid. Masked Input usually would clear out the field if its invalid, and then my thing would run and see its just a blank string'')
[08:24:10] <lduros> dmsuperman: ah!
[08:24:12] <lduros> looks like it
[08:24:55] <dmsuperman> $.grep([{a:5},{a:6},{a:6,b:7}], function(v){ return v.a == 6; });
[08:25:04] <Cryp71c> Has anyone here used the shadowbox library, by chance?
[08:25:18] <dmsuperman> lduros: that behaves how you want it I believe :)
[08:25:26] <dmsuperman> you would just do return v.a;
[08:25:37] <dmsuperman> to check existence
[08:25:37] <Cryp71c> (or, have a better shadow-box/lightbox type library you prefer over the others [there are certainly numerous options])
[08:26:40] <lduros> dmsuperman: hmm yeh looks like it
[08:26:58] <lduros> dmsuperman: thanks!
[08:27:00] <esiegel> Any ideas about setting position: feed on scroll?
[08:27:04] <esiegel> fixed*

[08:33:23] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise whether there's a more lightweight/tidy/more efficient way of doing this code: http://pastie.org/3698317 I want everything to be as quick and tidy as possible?
[08:34:47] <Haprog> davidw: atleast I found some weird behaviour when you set width in CCS or attribute and height in the other. See this http://jsfiddle.net/SFvVg/1/ On Chrome and Firefox the 2nd and 4th canvas aren't the same size, but on IE9 they are all 100x50. weird.
[08:35:01] <Haprog> this seems to affect only the canvas element
[08:35:31] <Haprog> doesn't matter if you set it with jQuery or plain HTML/CSS
[08:35:41] <anphonic> ok, so I iterate over an xml file with a .each(function ...
[08:35:50] <davidw> Haprog, ugh:-/
[08:35:59] <anphonic> at the end i output the contents to a div
[08:36:08] <anphonic> I can make it output it all just fine
[08:36:37] <anphonic> http://oklahomawelcome.com/xmltest/
[08:36:42] <anphonic> there, thats easier lol
[08:37:57] <anphonic> It outputs the contents of the xml just fine
[08:38:44] <davidw> Haprog, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977741/resizable-canvas-jquery-ui
[08:38:45] <anphonic> I need to detect if there is content there and clear it but ONLY after its output the entire forecast
[08:38:51] <davidw> u-g-l-y
[08:39:24] <fALSO> lol porco
[08:40:19] <anphonic> ,
[08:41:09] <Haprog> davidw: so you need to wrap the canvas in another element that resizes instead of actually changing the width and height of the canvas directly.
[08:41:20] <davidw> Haprog, or use the second way...
[08:41:25] <Haprog> yea
[08:41:47] <Haprog> but on that example it uses the wrapper #resize for both
[08:42:03] <davidw> this is inherited code that a lot of people have messed with... messing with it too much is probably bad
[08:42:06] <Haprog> I meant #strech and #resize
[08:42:45] <Haprog> but seems like a browser bug with the fiddle I made
[08:47:35] <Articate> how can I check if, say, $("input[name=foo]") is disabled?
[08:48:09] <poppiez> anyone familiar with the ajaxForm plugin? I have this modal that uses ajaxForm to upload a file. when submitting, I want it to submit behind the scenes and I want to allow the user to upload another file simultaneously. how may I do so? can I move the form to a container div that I append to each time I submit so that it can submit there? hope it makes sense
[08:49:40] <Articate> if ($("input[name=foo]").attr("disabled") == "disabled")? the problem being that the attr("disabled") will only exist if it's disabled.
[08:50:50] <Haprog> Articate: use .prop("disabled") instead
[08:50:58] <Articate> thanks :)
[08:51:28] <amino_> hi
[08:51:46] <amino_> anyone could help me understand why http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-4/f09/resources/gm_jq_xhr.js (bridge between jQuery and GM_xmlhttpRequest that allows to make cross domains requests in a userscript) works fine with jquery 1.3, but not with versions 1.5 and above?
[08:52:27] <anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/anphonic/MDfNQ/
[08:52:54] <anphonic> I need to clear that data when someone enters a new zipcode, but only after the new data has been returned
[08:55:40] <z0ned> what's the proper way to check/uncheck a checkbox? what does the .is(':checked') selector do to determine?
[08:55:56] <Jon47> z0ned .prop('checked', true/false)
[08:58:29] <z0ned> thanks
[08:58:54] <erebel55> lo
[09:03:33] <esiegel> I have this (basically) this code on my website: http://jsfiddle.net/usTWN/
[09:03:57] <esiegel> In safari the content of the .side-nav does not scroll down
[09:04:12] <esiegel> It's very strange because it becomes fixed, just the content doesn't move.
[09:04:18] <esiegel> http://i.imgur.com/NyMgu.png
[09:04:25] <esiegel> This is what the inspector looks like
[09:04:30] <esiegel> In safari.
[09:04:41] <esiegel> Any help with this would be very greatly appreciated.
[09:06:59] <jita> Which plugin for image galleries with next/previous buttons is best ?
[09:08:45] <RustIndy> new, simple jQuery polyfill plugin for CSS3 min() and mx() functions - https://github.com/indyarmy/jquery.cssMinMax.plugin
[09:08:55] <RustIndy> barely tested though ;)
[09:11:09] <jita> RustIndy, thats for me ?
[09:15:58] <RustIndy> sorry, if anyone said anything to me in the past 5 minutes, i missed it. my irc client went all goofy
[09:25:14] <primeras> hi all. Sorry my English isn't very well. I'm that code with all checkbox checked.
[09:25:15] <primeras> http://pastebin.com/KeyahCZY
[09:25:56] <primeras> but that code in it <input type=checbox disabled ..> checked
[09:26:41] <primeras> example
[09:26:41] <primeras> http://pastebin.com/XLLgKDSZ
[09:26:47] <primeras> 1 checked. 2 checked
[09:27:05] <primeras> but 2 should not be checked

[09:45:17] <stevecrozz> any recommendations on a good jquery tooltip library?
[09:49:47] <haizum> how do i re-initialize a .js script thats been called by my header?
[09:50:15] <haizum> e.g. i have a music player that i want to be re-called when a user scrolls down a dynamically loaded page, so that it re-initializes the player and adds the new mp3s
[09:50:28] <haizum> its a .js file from an external source
[09:50:48] <Jon47> depends on how the js script works
[09:51:05] <haizum> ?
[09:51:08] <stevecrozz> put the player in an iframe and reload the iframe?
[09:51:50] <haizum> it works by gathering all the mp3s on a page and adding them to the list. my parent div is being appended content by infinite scroll, so it should work fine if its re-called
[09:52:01] <anphonic> is there a valid zipcode array for the US?
[09:52:04] <haizum> which i can do with a callback
[09:52:53] <haizum> right now if i just put the <script src="www.player.com/player.js"></script> in my javascript, it doesnt seem to want to be called
[09:57:36] <aarobc_work1> So, in FF it seems if I have a form that contains text itputs that are empty, they won't be picked up by .serialize(). Is there away around this?
[09:59:38] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have any experience with bootstrap not working in tables
[09:59:41] <jeffsmykil> the popover
[10:01:37] <haizum> http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/loadjavascriptcss.shtml
[10:01:40] <haizum> i did it this way and it worked
[10:06:52] <jeffsmykil> how would I do a live for $("#foo").popover();
[10:12:46] <brettster> hey guys
[10:12:55] <Hornet> best way to make a hasAttr()-like statement in query?
[10:12:57] <brettster> what is up with jquerys .height() and safari
[10:13:12] <Hornet> more specifically I need to see if the current checkbox is checked and return true/false
[10:13:17] <haizum> how do i "kill" an already loaded .js script?
[10:13:19] <Hornet> so I suppose a has/is with:selected?
[10:13:25] <Hornet> you don't
[10:13:25] <haizum> i've tried just re-loading it, but it doesnt seem to work
[10:13:35] <haizum> think i need to kill it and then re-call it
[10:13:35] <Hornet> then you're still loading the old one
[10:13:45] <Haprog> Hornet: .prop('checked') == true
[10:14:45] <Haprog> Hornet: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:14:52] <Hornet> yus already there
[10:14:55] <Hornet> interesting
[10:15:23] <Hornet> well that's probably caused some bugs in older code then
[10:15:28] <Hornet> oh well, update custom ahoy
[10:15:47] <Hornet> looks handy, thanks
[10:15:50] <Haprog> np
[10:19:14] <wookiehangover> how do I use window.open and not have it be caught by popup blockers?
[10:19:30] <Haprog> you don't
[10:22:19] <wookiehangover> Haprog: well how do all these awesome porn site do it?
[10:22:23] <wookiehangover> riddle me that
[10:22:53] <LakWork> wookiehangover
[10:23:32] <Haprog> wookiehangover: could you give an example?
[10:23:37] <LakWork> the way popup blockers work is by responding to unsolicited, non-user-action driven events. If you call window.open when the user clicks something, it will not be blocked, but if you call window.open on page load, it will be caught
[10:23:58] <wookiehangover> LakWork: so this is in response to a user interaction
[10:24:01] <LakWork> as long as the user clicked the page somewhere, window.open should work
[10:24:07] <LakWork> which is how all those sites work
[10:24:09] <wookiehangover> but I get the new URL to open from an ajax call
[10:24:18] <jeffsmykil> couldn't you use window.open on mouse move if you wanted to be evil?
[10:24:37] <wookiehangover> so I'm calling it from within a click handler
[10:25:03] <LakWork> jeffsmykil probably not
[10:25:05] <wookiehangover> but its wrapped in a callback from the ajax call that's fired
[10:25:15] <LakWork> i imagine most popup blockers would catch that
[10:25:25] <wookiehangover> LakWork: true story bro
[10:25:39] <LakWork> wookiehangover you can always open the popup with a click then load the new url after
[10:25:55] <wookiehangover> interesting
[10:26:20] <LakWork> i think you can open "about:blank" for example
[10:26:25] <LakWork> then redirect
[10:26:33] <wookiehangover> and then how would I set the url to that window later?
[10:26:48] <LakWork> with a handle to the window you opened
[10:26:57] <LakWork> var mywin = window.open(...)
[10:26:59] <jeffsmykil> why are you asking this, what evil things are you going to do?
[10:27:03] <LakWork> mywin.location.href = ""
[10:27:46] <wookiehangover> LakWork: thanks, I'll try that
[10:28:18] <wookiehangover> jeffsmykil: I'm working for Haliburton, BP, and the Devil... really evil shit
[10:31:18] <anphonic> wookiehangover: at least you werent working for BHP doing title work in AR
[10:32:01] <monk12> is there a way to setup an event where when an ajax element shows up on the page to then run my function?
[10:32:16] <monk12> 'on'/'live' needs events, and not sure there is one for that scenario.
[10:32:38] <monk12> right now, i have a setTimeout checking the page for if that element shows up, then do stuff.
[10:33:08] <wookiehangover> LakWork: that worked great, danke
[10:34:13] <LakWork> bitte!
[10:36:27] <KasperKRK> maybe anybody know where I find goooood tutorial how made ajax file upload? :))
[10:36:39] <erebel55> does anyone know how to get .height() working with groups? <g>
[10:36:42] <LakWork> you might checkout www.uploadify.com
[10:36:48] <LakWork> it's a full featured ajax upload plugin
[10:40:29] <erebel55> or does anyone know how to measure a group height?

[10:41:54] <CodeFriar> I'm trying to figure out how to programattically select a select box option by the option's value any pointers ?
[10:46:01] <Whirl3d> closest includes the element you are checking from, correct? so $("someimgelement").closest("img") would be that element, right?
[10:47:13] <Articate> Is there a way I can append text instead of replacing text with .text("foo")?
[10:47:26] <alexr2> .append()
[10:47:49] <Articate> clue is in the title, eh?
[10:49:55] <anonym00se> hello i am wondering if there is any conflict in using jquery ui tabs within a jquery ui dialog, and if there are any common pitfalls
[10:50:13] <anonym00se> my tabs seem to be broken inside the dialog so i'm wondering if i am initializing the tabs properly
[10:50:48] <gentlemandroid> Anyone savvy MySQL?
[10:51:02] <anonym00se> pretty saavy
[10:51:16] <anonym00se> savvy*
[10:51:21] <anonym00se> how ever the hell you spell that word
[10:51:31] <gentlemandroid> savvy yes
[10:51:32] <anonym00se> where my jquery ui experts at
[10:51:41] <anonym00se> what do you need to know gentlemandroid
[10:52:05] <gentlemandroid> Making a form builder and would like to store the forms in a database
[10:52:12] <gentlemandroid> Then other users fill out the forms
[10:52:16] <Cronoh> anonymouse, i highly doubt that complication exists, i would be willing to be $50 its in your code and im a poor man
[10:52:25] <gentlemandroid> I was thinking I store each form definition as a separate table
[10:52:25] <anonym00se> heh Cronoh
[10:52:30] <anonym00se> i wouldn't take that bet
[10:52:34] <anonym00se> i'm almost certain it's my fault
[10:52:44] <anonym00se> i just have no clue where the issue lies
[10:53:09] <anonym00se> gentlemandroid: and?
[10:53:11] <Cronoh> genlteman it depends on the scope of your project, if all the forms have universal features, if so you might do a forminput table with form ids
[10:53:12] <gentlemandroid> How would I link a user account in one table to a newly created form definition table?
[10:53:25] <Cronoh> form table -> user_id column ?
[10:53:30] <gentlemandroid> That's just it I don't think the forms will be very similar
[10:53:47] <gentlemandroid> Ah yes
[10:53:52] <gentlemandroid> I was thinking about it the wrong way around
[10:53:55] <Cronoh> depends on fif you need one to many or many to many
[10:53:56] <gentlemandroid> Ty
[10:54:09] <Cronoh> if you need many users to be able to access each form you will need a seperate table
[10:54:14] <gentlemandroid> many to many actually
[10:54:21] <gentlemandroid> So I use like a transitional table?
[10:54:27] <Cronoh> form_access, user_id, form_id, link em up
[10:54:27] <gentlemandroid> Or whatever it's called
[10:54:41] <Cronoh> form_access table, and a user_id and form_id columns i mean
[10:54:48] <Cronoh> to link up access
[10:55:06] <gentlemandroid> Okay yea I think that makes sense
[10:55:28] <gentlemandroid> And the user_id/form_id is a compositional primary key?
[10:55:41] <gentlemandroid> I'm new to MySQL
[10:55:42] <Articate> Say I have a <div> that I fill with <span>s with append. Is there a way to clear all the spans in the <div>?
[10:55:49] <Cronoh> all users with access to form: select * FROM form_access where form_id = , user with single access, select * FROM  form_access where user_id = and form_id = , etc
[10:56:08] <Cronoh> no the user_id andform_id are not keys, you can index them if you want but thats it
[10:56:26] <Cronoh> the key is a seperate id field that i didnt list, but should be there, should be in every one of your tables
[10:56:58] <gentlemandroid> So just an auto inc key?
[10:57:04] <Cronoh> yes
[10:57:16] <Cronoh> Articate: http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[10:57:24] <gentlemandroid> Okay that makes sense, thank you Cronoh
[10:57:31] <Nolte-BRB> `..`.`..`. ><((((> Clones Detected in #jquery `..`.`..`. ><((((>
[10:57:32] <Articate> man, I should just stop asking and pretend the most logical word is a function
[10:57:36] <Cronoh> np, goodluck gentlemandroid
[10:57:46] <Cronoh> you should check google before you ask here
[10:57:50] <Cronoh> on just about everything ;p
[10:59:35] <blueadept> anyone know how you can get jquery datepicker to not refresh a page if you click off the calendar?
[11:06:45] <muley> why would my .ajax() call with dataType: 'json' send an extra parameter 'callback' with value 'jQuery1232145132387...'?
[11:07:14] <muley> i thought that was for jsonp
[11:07:41] <alexr2> i'm passing a variable into a function of an object.  the variable is a string that is the name of a function for the object.  is there any way (not eval) to run that function for the object?
[11:08:10] <muley> then the error callback of .ajax() says "jQuery152046530888070752363_1333130870767 was not called"
[11:09:17] <alexr2> muley, what data are you passing in for the ajax call?
[11:09:33] <boltR> is there a way to pass options to a callback function from an ajax call when requesting jsonp?
[11:10:00] <esiegel> Does anyone know why my fixed position element won't move in Safari?
[11:11:40] <Jon47> because it's fixed, duh
[11:11:59] <muley> alexr2: http://pastebin.com/3nBGNsQC
[11:12:16] <gentlemandroid> Cronoh: You still around?
[11:12:16] <muley> the data gets sent fine... the JSON gets returned fine (when i look at it in the firefox NET tab)
[11:12:34] <muley> but it's just expecting me to call that jsonp callback or something?
[11:13:20] <alexr2> weird, that's the same as my ajax calls but i've never had that issue
[11:13:24] <erebel55> does anyone know why when i zoom in on the pink component and then the grey one. it doesn't work correctly? http://jsfiddle.net/d2QDX/10/
[11:13:33] <esiegel> Thanks, Jon47. I'm setting it to become position: fixed when a user scrolls to a certain point and, although the styles attribute in the tag is changing, the element is not staying in it's location in the window, it's just staying in it's place on the page.
[11:13:39] <erebel55> press e to zoom. so click on pink component, press e. click on grey component press e.
[11:13:59] <muley> alexr2: ya... very weird
[11:14:19] <Jon47> esiegel can we see an example?
[11:14:43] <Cronoh> genlteman: yes
[11:14:45] <alexr2> what's the exact error you get?
[11:15:06] <Cronoh> just in a lot of channels pm me if u need me
[11:15:11] <esiegel> Jon47, here's a jsFiddle of the basic setup of the page, although it works in this example (I think because of the frames) http://jsfiddle.net/usTWN/
[11:15:32] <esiegel> Here's what the inspector looks like in safari after scroll down a bit… http://i.imgur.com/NyMgu.png
[11:15:37] <boltR> how do i pass options to a jsonp callback?
[11:15:48] <Jon47> esiegel … I've never heard of frames fixing a problem
[11:16:07] <Jon47> find out what's different between your full page and the example fiddle, and somewhere in there is the issue
[11:16:47] <esiegel> Jon47, as you can see in the screenshot the element seems to be locking to it's proper location in the window, but the content of the element is not.
[11:17:04] <muley> alexr2: the error() callback gets called (the json looks good in the NET tab though), and it says "parseerror" and "jQuery1520618959371908021_1333131074159 was not called"
[11:17:10] <esiegel> I'll work on getting a less-working fiddle.
[11:17:33] <muley> and that's the extra parameter it's sending with my ajax request... "callback" : "jQuery15206...."
[11:17:51] <muley> something must be making it jsonp
[11:20:38] <alexr2> yeah i got nothin, might wanna wait for someone who knows a bit more than me sorry
[11:20:47] <muley> reading here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8084
[11:20:54] <muley> ya thanks for looking
[11:21:42] <alexr2> yikes, why the hell are you on 1.5?  it's on 1.7.2 now
[11:22:10] <gnarf> muley: hrm, i don't see any reason that should go to jsonp
[11:22:24] <gnarf> muley: any chance you can give me a link to the live site, and the line of code for that ajax call?
[11:22:32] <muley> ya this site is older...
[11:22:33] <gnarf> muley: i can try to trace it for ya
[11:22:40] <muley> unfortunately it's on a vpn for testing
[11:22:42] <stan_man_can> can you only have one $(document).ready() per page?
[11:23:00] <muley> i think it's a jquery 1.5.1 bug
[11:23:04] <gnarf> muley: i can ssh tunnel / pptp if need be if you can get an account setup
[11:23:06] <muley> outdated anyway
[11:23:21] <gnarf> if you're on 1.5, you should at least update to the newest 1.5
[11:23:22] <gnarf> :)
[11:23:36] <muley> :d
[11:23:40] <muley> yep
[11:23:48] <muley> trying something... 1 sec
[11:24:54] <muley> this fixed it for me: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8084#comment:14
[11:25:19] <muley> i'm going to try upgrading jquery and see if it's an issue with the latest
[11:25:28] <gnarf> muley: thats a good patch, but if you ever need jsonp you're gonna get screwed :)
[11:25:29] <muley> unlikely
[11:25:46] <muley> ha yea...
[11:26:19] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8084#comment:26
[11:27:09] <gnarf> so if there is an =? or ?? in the url it will cause problems
[11:27:12] <gnarf> but i don't see that
[11:27:26] <muley> we have the jquery form plugin on the page
[11:28:08] <muley> old version of that too.. 2.67. seems they're at 3.02 now
[11:28:30] <jeffsmykil> possible to get width() to return the value without px?
[11:28:41] <muley> ya it's my issue... thanks for all the direction guys
[11:32:54] <stan_man_can> can you only have one $(document).ready per page?
[11:33:14] <stevecrozz> stan_man_can: you can have as many as you like
[11:33:56] <stan_man_can> weird,doesn't seem to be working
[11:34:09] <f0rkn1ght> stafamus,  Example ?
[11:37:58] <boltR> i'm using jsonp to get json data
[11:38:06] <boltR> is there a way to force jquery to read the data as json?
[11:38:13] <boltR> since the response is not wrapped in a callback function
[11:44:10] <Rob_B> Where can I find out what's new in the latest build of jQuery?
[11:45:47] <mr_pinc> Anyone know a good web framework /cms that lets you edit content by defining particular classes in css
[11:47:25] <Eviltwin> Wait, you change the concent by defining classes in CSS?
[11:47:28] <Eviltwin> Explain more
[11:48:06] <Eviltwin> 'Cause if you're asking what I think you're asking, such a thing hopefully does not exist and never should
[11:48:19] <mr_pinc> no, you define editable content by giving it a particular css class - then you login to some script on the site which then will display the content but make those pieces editable
[11:49:12] <xmaddness> hmmm, that seems like you are trying to put the cart before the horse
[11:49:18] <mr_pinc> you then save and then the script will actually modify the static pages
[11:49:43] <mr_pinc> i've seen this done many times before, just not sure if there is a "best" framework for this
[11:49:43] <ircjsbot> mr_pinc, sorry, I have never seen this.
[11:51:20] <Eviltwin> There are limits to what content-editable can do on its own
[11:51:25] <Eviltwin> And they vary by browser
[11:51:59] <mr_pinc> you don't use content-editable - the cms will have it's own hooks you need to work into your markup
[11:54:30] <mr_pinc> http://www.surrealcms.com/how-it-works
[11:54:37] <mr_pinc> http://unify.unitinteractive.com/
[11:55:26] <BigDaddyBates> was up any ladies
[11:56:07] <erebel55> lol
[11:57:33] <RustIndy> mr_pinc: modx does that as well
[11:58:59] <mr_pinc> thanks rust - will check it out
[12:00:30] <mr_pinc> rustindy: that looks a lot more full featured - almost like a wordpress / joomla type app
[12:02:15] <RustIndy> mr_pinc: true, it's a full CMS. there's also http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable, which i've used in the past (worked pretty well)
[12:02:29] <wwwroth> Anyone here farmilar with the qtip plugin? Having trouble when the viewport is flipped the Y axis gets messed up and covers the trigger'd element
[12:03:26] <wwwroth> http://staging.treecycler.com/plantatree/ <- check out the qtip on the map and when there isn't enough room above the viewport it falls below but the TIP covers the marker element.
[12:04:30] <mr_pinc> RustIndy: yeah that one looks like it would do well
[12:04:35] <mr_pinc> thank you
[12:04:40] <RustIndy> no problem
[12:04:40] <rpk_> I'm trying to handle a click event on a checkbox.  I have a live event registered in the checkbox's containers' container, which I'm trying to stop with return false from the click event.  (this works).  However, when entering my click event, I see the checkbox change state to checked.  However, after exiting my click event, the checkbox 'unchecks' itself
[12:05:19] <mr_pinc> RustIndy: i like how they include the phpscripts
[12:05:54] <rpk_> I would guess that this is because stopping propogation means that the action that would normally cause the checkbox to change state will no longer fire.  However, because the checkbox is always cleared after exiting my click event, I cannot change the state of the checkbox (to the correct state) within the click event
[12:06:02] <g0rd0n> i there! i am using the jqueryui tabs in ajax mode, thus the hashes always look like #ui-tabs-1, #ui-tabs-2 etc... i wonder if it is possible to specify the hash names for each tag even when using them in ajax mode?
[12:08:42] <ezioa> is there a way to add html inside a div before or after a specific child element?
[12:10:06] <rpk_> small example: http://jsfiddle.net/MwRtM/
[12:10:49] <ironfroggy> does anyone know why i dont see the method "rotate" in the tabs plugin at github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/ ?
[12:14:05] <rpk_> nvm, fixed with .on instead of .live, always forget that/

[12:33:23] <nishttal2> is there a way to have some color shading in the background
[12:34:06] <supermanjnk> Question: Ideally when using ajax widget type things, should I include the code for the widget in  the head of the page, and apply it after load, or should I apply it from within the page i'm loading?
[12:34:47] <nishttal2> i mean like a glow or gradient
[12:34:54] <nishttal2> or using images in the only option
[12:39:06] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: For modern browsers, you can create a background gradient in CSS. This tool makes it pretty easy - http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[12:45:30] <xSmurf> hey all, so I wana know when my window has or doesn't have focus... but the problem is I embed youtube videos in an iframe and that makes the main window emit the blur event even though it's still technicallu front most
[12:45:38] <xSmurf> any idea how I could go around that??
[12:46:33] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, thats perfect.. exactly what i was looking for.. is there a way for the size to be in percentage though?
[12:46:45] <jonathanj> hello
[12:46:54] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, rt now its just repeating gradient bands and looks horrible
[12:47:02] <jonathanj> how do i set the "disabled" attribute on an element?
[12:47:41] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: You can set color stops with percentage. That's the default. Otherwise you'll need to poke around with it.
[12:47:52] <jonathanj> $(elem).attr('disabled', '') doesn't seem to actually set the attribute (at least according to Firebug) and CSS rules related to the disabled selector don't fire
[12:49:02] <warrenparsons> jonathanj: disabled is a property. Try $(elem).prop('disabled', true);
[12:52:25] <jonathanj> warrenparsons: ah, thanks. what's the difference between a property and an attribute?
[12:52:58] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, no thats not what i meant.. is there a place i can upload/share the an image with you
[12:53:05] <warrenparsons> jonathanj: Mostly that properties are boolean, while attributes have multilple possible values.
[12:54:26] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, if you look at http://i43.tinypic.com/r8t91y.png the background is repeating
[12:54:43] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, i want one gradiant that scales when the browser is scaled
[12:55:58] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: That's what the tool gives you by default. You're doing something wrong.
[12:56:34] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, i didnt touch anything.. just pasted the css under the body tag
[12:56:54] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: CSS goes in the head or preferably an external file.
[12:57:14] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, yeah in a external file.. but inside body { }
[12:57:27] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, bcoz i want it to apply to the body tag
[12:57:39] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: Ahh, misunderstood.
[12:57:54] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: Sorry, but I don't have time to help you diagnose right now.
[12:58:31] * Jonadabe remembers jQuery current release is 1.7.2
[12:59:16] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, no problem.. thanks for your help
[12:59:37] * Eviltwin remembers jQuery only existed in his dream and isn't a real product.
[13:04:59] <nishttal2> here is a part of my page where I am creating a jquery dialog.. http://pastebin.com/TbF4DUj7 .. how do i make it snap to a grid (grid: 50) is not working
[13:06:10] <Jonadabe> `..`.`..`. ><((((> Clones Detected in #jquery `..`.`..`. ><((((>
[13:16:10] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, i fixed it.. just had to add html {  min-height: 100%;} in the style sheet.. pretty cool!!!!
[13:16:23] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: Very good.
[13:17:05] <supsup> anyone know how to pass a selfexecuting anon function from a child iframe to it's parent on same domain?
[13:17:09] <Jonadabe> `..`.`..`. ><((((> Clones Detected in #jquery `..`.`..`. ><((((>
[13:17:23] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, could you help me with my other question above.. should be a simple thing that I am missing
[13:18:09] <warrenparsons> nishttal2: I'm afraid not.
[13:18:17] <nishttal2> warrenparsons, ok np
[13:21:28] <supermanjnk> Anyone around that can answer a question about ajax and best practices?
[13:26:05] <raj> can I listen for class changes on a particular class (which may attain a second class)?
[13:28:58] <nishttal2> how do I make the dialog box snap to grid
[13:31:49] <raj> nishttal2, http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/snap-to.html
[13:32:43] <Eviltwin> raj: Can't listen to class changes no
[13:32:53] <nishttal2> raj, thanks.. this is great
[13:32:55] <Eviltwin> For the most part you can't listen to anything that only JavaScript can cahnge
[13:33:28] <Eviltwin> Since it'd be JavaScript that's changing it, JavaScript can notify anything that's interested in the change
[13:33:45] <raj> k
[13:34:04] <raj> Eviltwin, I was trying not to mix this into that code
[13:34:46] <raj> can i make some custom event happen when the class is changed that I can listen for?
[13:34:53] <raj> cuz I have a few ways the class can change
[13:35:33] <xSmurf> hey all, I'm using $(window).focus/blur to know when my page is frontmost, but I embed a youtube video in my page and the iframe makes the main window looses focus, is there anyway around that???
[13:35:49] <Eviltwin> Well anywhere you do add/remove/toggle for a class, you can also do .trigger("classchange")
[13:35:57] <Eviltwin> And then .on("classchange", function() { ... })
[13:36:00] <Eviltwin> Where you're interested
[13:36:03] <raj> beautiful
[13:36:30] <nishttal2> raj, its not working with dialog
[13:36:58] <Eviltwin> raj: Or you may want .triggerHandler
[13:37:04] <Eviltwin> raj: You can see the differences on the API pages
[13:37:15] <Eviltwin> ?triggerHandler @ raj
[13:37:16] <bot-t> raj, .triggerHandler(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers attached to an element for an event. http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/
[13:37:24] <nishttal2> $('#dialog').dialog({autoOpen: true,width: 600,snap: true});
[13:37:34] <raj> yeah, i was just reading about that
[13:37:46] <o-O-o> hi. how can I use getJSON in a synchronous way?
[13:39:02] <raj> nishttal2, looking
[13:39:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/sCmJ7/48/
[13:39:17] <Seldon75> is there a way to get the background-image of an element to fadeOut()
[13:39:22] <Seldon75> rather than the element itself?
[13:39:44] <raj> nishttal2, http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to
[13:39:51] <raj> click View Source
[13:40:14] <raj> what in the world, there is invalid js in there
[13:40:19] <raj> .draggable {}??
[13:40:28] <raj> a method without an object
[13:40:38] <nishttal2> raj, these are not dialogs
[13:40:40] <Whirl3d> sry. Nvm. Capitlization error
[13:41:14] <o-O-o> hi. how can I use jquery,getJSON() in a synchronous way? I need it to block until the transaction is done
[13:41:34] <NoiseEee> o-O-o: learn how to use callbacks.
[13:44:18] <raj> nishttal2, you can select the element to be draggable and then do that
[13:44:32] <raj> but it's redundant, being that the dialog itself is already draggable
[13:44:44] <raj> i'm not sure how you'd bind something to its drag event
[13:45:15] <nishttal2> raj .. ok i'll google some more.. thanks for your help
[13:45:33] <raj> k
[13:45:36] <raj> np
[13:45:37] <thang> draggable has events you can bind functions to
[13:45:58] <csurap> how can i push out an div with another div (both div`s inside another div)
[13:46:00] <raj> but the jquery ui dialog is already "draggable"
[13:46:04] <csurap> more like a slider
[13:46:12] <shoky> go raj go
[13:46:22] <raj> haha :)
[13:46:27] <shoky> ;p
[13:47:13] <erebel55> i have a handle to a group which contains a rect. i'm trying to get the width of the rectangle but it's returning 0
[13:47:22] <erebel55> selected.find("rect").width()
[13:47:35] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/GRxVC/
[13:47:40] <raj> nishttal2, $('.dlg').dialog().parents('.ui-dialog').draggable('option', 'snap',
[13:47:40] <raj> true);
[13:47:47] <erebel55> am i doing something stupid?
[13:47:53] <raj> so you can just be redundant
[13:49:57] <erebel55> nvm i'll just use selected.find("rect").attr("width");
[13:52:26] <o-O-o> NoiseEee: it NEEDS to be synchronous
[13:52:51] <o-O-o> does anyone knows how can I use jquery,getJSON() in a synchronous way?
[13:53:04] <o-O-o> NoiseEee: I am using callbacks too, but I need that to be synched
[13:55:01] <gehsekky> o-O-o: getJSON is a shortcut for $.ajax
[13:55:12] <gehsekky> use $.ajax and set 'async' to false
[13:55:27] <o-O-o> gehsekky: yeah! I am diigging the docs, so I'll have to use ajax like it was getJSON...
[13:56:23] <FrameFever> how can I get all children of an element
[13:56:28] <FrameFever> also the nested ones
[13:56:28] <NoiseEee> honestly, there's rarely ever a need for async to be false
[13:56:36] <FrameFever> ?
[13:57:06] <gehsekky> NoiseEee: it comes in handy in more complicated web apps
[13:57:11] <o-O-o> gehsekky: is there a way to get the json "data" variable (the one I get on the success callback) on the resulting xhr object?
[13:57:32] <gehsekky> o-O-o: in the success callback?
[13:57:34] <o-O-o> gehsekky: it is necessary if I want to do a proper SAFARI implementation
[13:57:45] <o-O-o> gehsekky: getJSON has a success callback that has a data argument
[13:57:50] <gehsekky> yea
[13:57:57] <o-O-o> is this present also on the xhr resulting object?
[13:58:48] <FrameFever> no idea?
[14:00:19] <gehsekky> o-O-o: like xhr.responseText?
[14:00:59] <o-O-o> yeah, but I want it parsed, since I was doing a getJSON
[14:01:15] <o-O-o> and the data object on the callback was already parsed :-)
[14:02:07] <o-O-o> nevermind. I'll use a closure
[14:03:30] <raj> Eviltwin, is it valid to put .trigger() on a function? or must it be a jquery selector?
[14:03:36] <raj> i mean jquery object
[14:04:18] <culh> Say I wanna select all objects with class 'hidden' in them, I'll do $('.hidden')...   Now if I wanna select all EXCEPT the ones with 'hidden', I'd do... what?
[14:04:32] <imsky> $(":not(.hidden)")
[14:04:32] <bot-t> (64 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky fuk dat
[14:04:39] <culh> thanks
[14:04:51] <culh> why the () ?
[14:05:03] <imsky> ok bot-t do your magic
[14:05:06] <imsky> ?:not
[14:05:07] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[14:05:27] <culh> ah ok
[14:05:41] <z0ned> how can i programmatically call the .change function associated with, for example, a checkbox? and will doing so actually check/uncheck the box?
[14:06:00] <imsky> $("input").trigger("change")
[14:06:04] <imsky> it's not a function, it's an event
[14:06:19] <imsky> and no it won't
[14:06:23] <NoiseEee> also, why not just call the handler?
[14:06:37] <imsky> if the handler is anonymous, going to be hard
[14:06:49] <z0ned> its not, but i need to bind "this"
[14:07:04] <imsky> godspeed z0ned
[14:09:05] <wwwroth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation
[14:09:19] <shoky> it's simple to bind 'this'
[14:09:21] <loffe> Challenge: can you make this a oneliner? http://jsfiddle.net/Kxrrm/
[14:09:37] <yoasif_work> how can i target links that are by themselves in a paragraph, without surrounding strings? eg. <p><a href="#">#</a></p> ?
[14:10:00] <imsky> loffe: sure i can, i can just take out the spaces and newlines
[14:10:05] <z0ned> lol
[14:10:14] <loffe> imsky, that's cheating :P
[14:10:25] <imsky> so what's your definition of oneliner
[14:10:37] <loffe> I feel there is a more jquery-ish way of doing it
[14:10:47] <z0ned> doing it in one line wouldn't be as performant as it is now, because you probably want to cache the $(this) ..
[14:11:03] <loffe> I'm not trying to obfuscate it, just write it cleaner
[14:11:23] <imsky> if i squint hard enough, it seems like you're solving a css problem with javascript
[14:11:29] <imsky> which i'm told by my standardista nazi friends is bad
[14:11:42] <loffe> If I have several <a>, can I somehow get rid of the "each" ?
[14:11:46] <imsky> yes
[14:11:56] <imsky> it's already an array, so .css works on all of them
[14:12:24] <csurap> console.log give position as relative but firebug shows it as absolute any idea?
[14:12:35] <imsky> by definition, the parent will wrap around the child ever so snugly
[14:12:38] <loffe> imsky, yes, it originates from a css-problem, that has cross-browser issues. This is the easy way out after several hours
[14:12:45] <imsky> so..you're doing nothing interesting here
[14:13:01] <imsky> so if it's a hack, why try to hack the hack?
[14:13:18] <imsky> assigning $(this) to self btw is just a waste of space
[14:13:31] <imsky> in fact you shouldn't even be doing that
[14:13:36] <imsky> your selector should target images instead
[14:14:31] <yoasif_work> http://jsfiddle.net/EDHe4/3/ - i want it to target only the second link --  how can i target links that are by themselves in a paragraph, without surrounding strings?
[14:15:33] <imsky> doin some screenscraping eh
[14:16:36] <yoasif_work> any ideas? i was thinking about using innerhtml, but i feel like it should be easier than that
[14:16:54] <shoky> yoasif_work i don't think there is a simple way
[14:17:09] <shoky> you could filter the .contents()
[14:17:18] <imsky> sure there's a simple way
[14:17:35] <Eviltwin> raj: All the event stuff is designed to work on jQuery objects
[14:17:38] <shoky> a simple selector?
[14:17:44] <yoasif_work> i updated the fiddle
[14:17:47] <yoasif_work> http://jsfiddle.net/EDHe4/4/
[14:17:59] <Eviltwin> But that doesn't mean the jQuery object necessarily needs to contain DOM elements
[14:18:11] <yoasif_work> i want it to return only the second link :)
[14:18:54] <imsky> yoasif_work: http://jsfiddle.net/4w2E9/
[14:19:13] <shoky> that's not simple ;p
[14:19:22] <imsky> are we still in "oneliner" mode?
[14:19:27] <yoasif_work> haha
[14:19:35] <shoky> no, we are in 'oneselector' mode
[14:19:44] <imsky> oh ok good luck in fantasyland
[14:19:48] <shoky> ;)
[14:19:56] <yoasif_work> hmm... so i could target the added class
[14:20:06] <yoasif_work> (js beginner here, sorry)
[14:20:34] <imsky> yoasif_work: it's a brittle solution. if you add spaces in the P, it fails. so you have to really extend it
[14:20:56] <yoasif_work> imsky: ok
[14:23:20] <o-O-o> have you getting issues with IE 9?
[14:23:41] <yoasif_work> imsky: i was testing http://jsfiddle.net/EDHe4/5/ but i can't figure out how to return what i find and feed it to .embedly
[14:25:26] <imsky> yoasif_work: yeah i dunno what you're trying to do there
[14:25:51] <yoasif_work> hehe
[14:27:15] <shoky> why does hardly anyone here indent by default :\

[14:30:29] <coldhead> ?ready @ Hypah

[14:36:01] <raj> Eviltwin, so any way to trigger an event anytime a function runs?
[14:36:30] <dismist> yeah
[14:36:37] <dismist> event.go at the end of the function?
[14:37:46] <shoky> at the end? that's hardly satisfactory
[14:37:52] <Eviltwin> Or make a copy of the function and replace it with something that calls the copy then triggers
[14:37:54] <supsup> why if i create an id in a iframe child then append that id to it's parent , then execute a function over it (.dialog) it opens the dialog in the iframe (where the id does not even exist)?
[14:38:18] <supsup> id on a div
[14:38:22] <raj> Eviltwin, not sure what you mean
[14:38:24] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: that must be caused by a bug in your code. we'll need to see the code to work out what it is
[14:38:25] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ supsup
[14:38:26] <bot-t> supsup, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:38:41] <coldhead> ?demo @ SoloDragoon
[14:38:41] <bot-t> SoloDragoon, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:38:42] <supsup> can't create demo since it's using iframes same domain issue.

[14:38:48] <bot-t> everyone, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:38:51] <supsup> maybe i can.
[14:38:54] <Eviltwin> raj: So let's say your function is var doodad = function(x, y, z) { ... };
[14:38:54] <supsup> naw
[14:38:57] <shoky> ?demo @ bot-t
[14:38:58] <bot-t> bot-t, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:39:11] <shoky> bot-t, what's up
[14:39:11] <bot-t> shoky, It is decidedly so.
[14:39:19] <coldhead> OH GOD RAJ THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES
[14:39:23] <Eviltwin> You can do var doodad_copy = doodad; doodad = function(x, y, z) { doodad_copy(x,y,z); object.trigger("..."); };
[14:39:38] <Eviltwin> Now where people were calling doodad(...)
[14:39:54] <Eviltwin> You've actually replaced the function they were expecting with one that does some extra work too
[14:40:01] <dismist> yeah but you're talking about maximizing effeciency from within a FRAMEWORK?  you need to get outside of the damn framework for maximum effeciency man
[14:40:10] <shoky> doodad. is that a cute version of foobar
[14:40:34] <Eviltwin> shoky: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/doodad
[14:40:59] <shoky> so yeah it's a cute version of foobar
[14:41:06] <EugenA> i need a fullscreen slideshow showing images without scaling, only resizing
[14:41:21] <coldhead> cuter AND MORE RACIST
[14:41:36] <multipass> Is this not valid for a selector? $("nav ul ul > li:first-child")    the stuff i am applying is going beyond the child li of the ul ul.
[14:41:44] <shoky> fucken immigrant dads
[14:42:14] <SoloDragoon> @coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/Vx9gp/
[14:42:25] <coldhead> how deeply nested are your ULs, bro
[14:42:44] <yedimind> Jonadabe ?
[14:42:53] <yedimind> oh wow i was scrolled way back
[14:43:14] <shoky> with them fishies
[14:43:30] <raj> ok, so there's no way to just emit some event when a particular function runs
[14:43:45] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: what is this returning? script/getcustomer.php?id=10
[14:43:53] <raj> without doing that weird stuff with the copy
[14:43:54] <coldhead> you probably want to tell jQuery what format to expect
[14:43:58] <coldhead> json or html or w/e
[14:44:00] <raj> which kinda reminds me of a decorator
[14:44:09] <yoasif_work> http://jsfiddle.net/LSnYp/ i want only the second video to appear (.embedly is loading the video in the example)
[14:44:15] <shoky> or a wrapper function
[14:44:57] <SoloDragoon> Just running a PHP script pulling user data from the database. It loads the data properly. Just won't sort it. No special formatting / id's / classes. Just <tr><td></td></tr> data
[14:45:16] <raj> ya
[14:45:30] <raj> but it seems like it shouldn't be so difficult to emit some event when a function runs
[14:45:37] <raj> seems like a straight forward concept
[14:46:10] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: i would try simplifying your code to JUST dump the html straight in the table, then add all the timeout malarkey
[14:46:16] <coldhead> once it's working
[14:46:27] <coldhead> keep it simple, shit-for-brains and all that
[14:47:19] <shoky> raj, it's not a function you're writing yourself/
[14:47:20] <shoky> ?
[14:47:33] <raj> i've already written the function
[14:47:36] <Eviltwin> raj: The only way to have a function emit an event when it runs is to have the function actually emit the event
[14:47:40] <raj> but i don't wanna convolute it too much
[14:47:48] <raj> Eviltwin, how is that done?
[14:47:50] <shoky> should be one line to trigger an event
[14:48:08] <coldhead> this concludes my attention span for the moment, good luck SoloDragoon
[14:48:09] <raj> without setting the function eqal to a variable
[14:48:10] <Eviltwin> Well JavaScript doesn't have an event model you can control
[14:48:11] <coldhead> ?demo @ everyone
[14:48:12] <bot-t> everyone, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:48:23] <Eviltwin> So you can use jQuery's
[14:48:26] <yoasif_work> coldhead: i posted my demo above ;)
[14:48:32] <SoloDragoon> Still no luck with it. I removed all the extra code
[14:48:38] <coldhead> a gold star for you, yoasif_work
[14:48:40] <SoloDragoon> Its now just barebone code
[14:48:46] <yoasif_work> coldhead: woot
[14:48:51] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: same error?
[14:48:58] <SoloDragoon> Yup
[14:49:31] <coldhead> what if you comment out the tablesorter bit
[14:49:41] <coldhead> just to see the post() on its own
[14:50:11] <raj> Eviltwin, so how can a function emit a custom event in its very last line, without changing anything else?
[14:50:16] <o-O-o> have you getting issues jquery and IE 9?
[14:50:31] <SoloDragoon> Prior to having the sorter code in the function, it was its own entity that just loaded with the page, and it worked fine. But I will remove and check to see if it errors.
[14:50:38] <o-O-o> it seems the newer jquery versions don't work well on IE 9
[14:50:52] <Hypah> when does the function execute when you declare something like  $( function () { alert(1); } );
[14:50:57] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: if that tablesorter() call is freaking out i am stumped
[14:51:01] <coldhead> because it's pretty basic
[14:51:05] <coldhead> HOW CAN IT GO WRONG
[14:51:05] <shoky> Hypah, when the DOM is ready
[14:51:25] <Hypah> is it the same as $(document).ready( function () { alert(1); } )  ?
[14:51:29] <shoky> yes
[14:51:31] <Eviltwin> raj: So first, we need to talk about your use case
[14:51:52] <SoloDragoon> lol and thats why I am here. I don't get it either. It works on every other page just fine. Just when I load data from that script it won't sort. Keeps spitting back the same error.
[14:51:53] <Eviltwin> Do you want it to emit a DOM event at some node in the DOM?
[14:52:03] <Eviltwin> Does the event name or data depend on vars in that function?
[14:52:12] <raj> no
[14:52:26] <SoloDragoon> I could toss up the PHP code from the customer script, as its just basic data pulling / displaying
[14:52:30] <raj> i want to emit a custom event 'classChanged'
[14:52:33] <Eviltwin> If it doesn't emit a DOM event at some node in the DOM, where should it emit the event?
[14:52:58] <raj> because that funciton causes changes in classes
[14:53:34] <Eviltwin> Is this a global event? Telling you somewhere in the DOM a class changed?
[14:53:35] <shoky> what do you want happening in the event handler
[14:53:40] <raj> yes
[14:54:07] <Eviltwin> raj: Have you worked with the publish/subscribe model before?
[14:54:12] <raj> the eventhandler is gonna assess how many items within a selector have a particular class
[14:54:21] <raj> Eviltwin, i haven't
[14:54:26] <SoloDragoon> "Cannot read property 'type' of undefined" makes no sense lol
[14:54:33] <Eviltwin> It's basically what you're talking about
[14:54:41] <Eviltwin> Global events within your program
[14:54:48] <raj> cool
[14:54:51] <Eviltwin> Here's an insanely tiny jQuery implementation: https://gist.github.com/661855
[14:54:59] <Eviltwin> With some examples
[14:55:41] <coldhead> SoloDragoon: perhaps the HTML is invalid or perhaps you're nuking the thead or tbody?
[14:56:23] <Eviltwin> raj: So you could publish a classChange event and anything that is subscribed gets run
[14:57:01] <shoky> erm why use that pub/sub terminology and not just speak jquery
[14:57:11] <shoky> on/off/trigger
[14:57:26] <Eviltwin> shoky: Two-fold
[14:57:31] <Eviltwin> pubsub uses a singleton
[14:57:42] <Eviltwin> All events triggered on the same object
[14:57:42] <SoloDragoon> I updated the fiddle script on the top right, is the HTML running through a loop
[14:57:45] <raj> what's a singleton?
[14:57:48] <raj> ?g singleton
[14:57:49] <bot-t> raj, Singleton pattern - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern
[14:58:03] <Eviltwin> And the goal was to implement pub/sub, not jQuery global events
[14:58:24] <Eviltwin> raj: It's a fancy word for one copy of something in a global-ish variable
[14:58:33] <raj> k
[14:58:44] <shoky> hmm kay
[14:58:58] <raj> basically, anytime this function runs, a class is changed, so i wanna detect that class change and run a function
[14:59:07] <Eviltwin> shoky: So you see it uses $.publish and $.subscribe
[14:59:22] <Eviltwin> There is no $.on and $.off
[14:59:26] <Eviltwin> Those are in $.fn
[14:59:34] <SoloDragoon> By nature its supposed to be simple, for editing purposes. So as to why this doesn't work I haven't been able to figure out for a couple hours.
[14:59:53] <Eviltwin> So you need to build the singleton and you need to build the accessors to it either way
[15:00:13] <Eviltwin> But you could name those whatever you want
[15:00:21] <shoky> Eviltwin yeah I guess i should've said: on/off/trigger on a singleton jquery object
[15:00:29] <raj> eek, gotta bring groceries in
[15:00:31] <raj> brb
[15:00:34] <Eviltwin> ?g pub sub @ raj
[15:00:35] <bot-t> raj, Publishsubscribe pattern - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern
[15:04:48] <Hypah> why isn't there some way to check the validity of an ETag at the client-side level for, say, a <script src>, rather than having to send an extra HTTP request to the server to confirm that the browser has the most current resource?
[15:05:15] <Eviltwin> Hypah: I think you might be misunderstanding the purposes of an ETag
[15:05:55] <Eviltwin> How can the client confirm that it has the most current version of a resource without going to the server?
[15:06:10] <Eviltwin> Answer: It can't.
[15:06:18] <Eviltwin> At least not for sure
[15:06:38] <Hypah> Eviltwin, by the ETag of the resource being embedded directly somewher into the content of the html page being delivered
[15:06:42] <Hypah> somewhere*
[15:07:16] <Eviltwin> Well you can go ahead and embed those etags as you want
[15:07:17] <shoky> ?G ETag
[15:07:17] <bot-t> shoky, HTTP ETag - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag
[15:07:28] <Eviltwin> Just add ?{ETAG GOES HERE} to the static URLs
[15:08:04] <Hypah> good point Eviltwin
[15:08:10] <Eviltwin> That's how people do it
[15:08:25] <Eviltwin> If the ETag changes, the URL will look different and the browser will update the resource
[15:08:39] <Hypah> but wait, doesn't that still generate a request, with a 304 Not Modified response?
[15:09:09] <Eviltwin> Not if you use a epiry-based caching policy
[15:09:13] <Hypah> I want to bypass the request altogether if I can determine on the client-side that I already have the correct resource
[15:09:31] <Eviltwin> Hypah: Look at Freshness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache
[15:09:42] <Eviltwin> Under "Cache control"
[15:13:05] <Hypah> nice
[15:13:46] <Eviltwin> Expires-based caching is actually the reason you can have stale scripts displayed with new HTML
[15:16:09] <Barncat> anybody feeling altruistic?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755162/go-through-large-javascript-array-one-item-at-a-time-to-avoid-timeout-errors  making me crazy.
[15:18:22] <Eviltwin> Barncat: Try this: http://pastebin.com/XtvEQDCM

[15:19:44] <danzik17> not very familiar with raphael / svg....can they operate on detached elements?
[15:19:57] <g0th> hi
[15:20:26] <g0th> if I have a html element "el" I get a jquery element by $(el), right?
[15:20:36] <Eviltwin> Barncat: Also, is there a reason these all need to exist drawn at one time?
[15:20:54] <mayhem93> hey does jQuery have a method to get all the data- (HTML5) attributes from an element?
[15:21:00] <Eviltwin> g0th: Yes, you can take an HTML element el and make a jQuery object containing that element via $(el)
[15:21:07] <Eviltwin> mayhem93: see ?.data
[15:21:08] <bot-t> mayhem93, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:21:20] <mayhem93> i'm looking at it
[15:21:25] <mayhem93> before i came here lol
[15:21:28] <mayhem93> i was*
[15:21:29] <Barncat> Eviltwin hang on, trying it out… yeah they're in a scrolling div they kind of all have to be there unless I can lazy load them
[15:21:42] <Eviltwin> mayhem93: Scroll down to "HTML5 data-* Attributes"
[15:21:44] <mayhem93> ah i see
[15:21:55] <Eviltwin> Barncat: I would strongly suggest trying to lazy load them
[15:22:40] <Eviltwin> Or maybe activate on mouseover or something like that
[15:23:04] <g0th> Eviltwin: can I store this jQuery element e.g. in some array, append it to the body and still modify it from the array?
[15:23:38] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:23:48] <g0th> what about adding it with splice?
[15:24:50] <SoloDragoon> Finally got a different error, but it still doesn't make any sense.
[15:24:58] <Barncat> Eviltwin is it even possible to lazy load svgs?
[15:25:09] <Eviltwin> g0th: I think you might have a misunderstanding of how DOM elements work in JavaScript
[15:25:36] <g0th> but jQuery is not in the dom yet
[15:25:40] <g0th> the "el"
[15:25:49] <g0th> I thought it was like a HTML element
[15:26:01] <g0th> for a html element I can store it in an array like that
[15:26:02] <Eviltwin> Barncat: It's possible to lazy-load just about anything as long as you can define the criteria for when you load it in terms of Events and timers
[15:27:23] <Eviltwin> g0th: Do you know what an object is in JavaScript?
[15:27:53] <g0th> the definition of an object?
[15:27:57] <g0th> or how it is stored?
[15:28:22] <g0th> it is a word for a programming structure in the language of js
[15:28:47] <Eviltwin> A jQuery object is an object. Objects can be added to the end of arrays, or in the middle via splice etc
[15:29:02] <Eviltwin> Regardless of whether or not they contain elements that are or aren't in the DOM
[15:29:43] <g0th> ok
[15:29:56] <g0th> I do the following:
[15:30:00] <Eviltwin> I'm really not understanding the confusion
[15:30:11] <g0th>     this.status.actionList.splice(index,0,$(this.actionHtml(index)));
[15:30:17] <g0th>     $(this._bar).append(this.status.actionList[index]);
[15:30:30] <g0th>   (this.status.actionList.splice(index,1)).remove();
[15:30:48] <g0th> but the last command is not working because it tells me that remove is not a function of ...
[15:31:14] <Barncat> Eviltwin thanks, didn't quite work but I'm going to look into lazy-drawing them instead
[15:31:44] <Eviltwin> g0th: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[15:31:51] <Eviltwin> Please look at the return type for splice
[15:32:34] <chilversc> g0th: the jquery object isn't an array, I didn't think it had a splice function
[15:32:52] <g0th> huh, do I call splice on it?
[15:33:03] <chilversc> g0th: so that must mean that actionList is an array, at which point, why do you expect the array to have a remove method
[15:33:06] <g0th> I call splice on the actionList which is an array
[15:33:18] <chilversc> g0th: or did you mean; $(this.status.actionList.splice(index, 1)).remove(); ?
[15:33:19] <g0th> I remove the returned element
[15:33:38] <g0th> (this.status.actionList.splice(index, 1)) <- this is the jquery element, no?
[15:33:44] <g0th> that's what splice says from the documentation
[15:33:49] <g0th> that it returns the element
[15:33:54] <chilversc> g0th: oh, right so actionList is an array of jquery objects?
[15:33:54] <Eviltwin> g0th: No, it doesn't say that
[15:33:58] <rodyhaddad> chilversc, yes jquery has a splice function :)
[15:33:59] <g0th> yes
[15:34:10] <Eviltwin> Okay, let me ask you this
[15:34:16] <Eviltwin> Say I have var x = [document.body];
[15:34:18] <chilversc> rodyhaddad: odd, the jquery docs don't find
[15:34:22] <Eviltwin> And I do x.innerHTML, what do I get?
[15:34:26] <g0th> oh, I see
[15:34:27] <Eviltwin> chilversc: It's not documented for whatever reason
[15:34:38] <g0th> it returns an array, I just found another definition where it is more explicit
[15:34:45] <g0th> but I also tried that and it didn't work
[15:35:06] <Eviltwin> You tried what?
[15:36:49] <g0th>     var removed=this.status.actionList.splice(index,1)[0];
[15:36:49] <g0th>     removed.remove();
[15:36:58] <g0th> so stupid of me
[15:37:13] <g0th> I used this.status.actionList when removing the jquery element
[15:37:20] <g0th> but at that time it was already removed, lol
[15:37:36] <g0th> lost almost 2h on this ^^

[16:37:10] <kippy__> Guys, what is the best way to get involved with jQuery development?
[16:43:24] <magcius> gah, replaceWith is the dumbest API ever -- if it's in the DOM, return the old object. If it's not in the DOM, return the new object.
[16:50:07] <devOlsen> kippy___ depends on how well you are familiarized with JavaScirpt methods such as DOM traversing and attribute / DOM manipulation. If you are not up to speed with that first, I would suggest you read Jeremy Keith's "DOM scripting" book first. then segwaying into jQuery will be much faster.
[16:57:19] <jonathanj> hrm, how would i flash (animating the background colour) an element with jQueryUI?
[17:00:32] <brianloveswords> If anybody's got some cycles to spare, I'd love it if you'd run this perf test: http://jsperf.com/jquery-is-checked-vs-attr-checked
[17:01:15] <piklu> what is suitable TLD for domain for personal educational bloh
[17:01:18] <piklu> bloh
[17:01:20] <piklu> blog
[17:02:01] <rue> Any?
[17:03:26] <chilversc> brianloveswords: wondering, how does that compare to .prop('checked')
[17:03:40] <brianloveswords> chilversc: I was just about to add that
[17:04:22] <chilversc> apparently my chrome is out of date
[17:05:26] <brianloveswords> chilversc: http://jsperf.com/jquery-is-checked-vs-attr-checked/2 $.prop is the unambiguous winner.

[17:25:04] <rich_> hello
[17:25:34] <rich_> i would be very nice if someone could help me out with my problem.
[17:27:23] <g0th> hmm, can I do $(el).click(...) on a html element el, which was not yet inserted into the dom such that it works as expected once I append it?
[17:28:13] <g0th> does it matter how "el" is appended?
[17:28:53] <g0th> I guess it does, i.e. I probably have to append the jquery element and cannot just use "el" anymore
[17:29:07] <coldhead> it depends what el is/was/will be
[17:29:13] <coldhead> but can't you use ?on
[17:29:13] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:30:36] <g0th> ok, so I use on
[17:30:51] <g0th> el is a html element
[17:31:29] <g0th> I plan to do $(el).on("click",someFunction); and then document.body.appendChild(el)....
[17:31:35] <g0th> but I guess this does not work?
[17:31:52] <coldhead> el is like an html string?
[17:32:05] <g0th> el=document.createElement("div"); ....
[17:32:09] <coldhead> ew
[17:32:14] <coldhead> why are you doing that?
[17:32:22] <g0th> because it is like this everywhere
[17:32:30] <g0th> I should change all that to jquery?
[17:32:42] <g0th> is there an easy search and replace script that I can run?
[17:32:54] <coldhead> i would go for $('<div />').appendTo('#wherever').on('click',, ...)
[17:33:18] <Aerathi> It appears that I only needed to add select: true on the binding.
[17:33:18] <g0th> I have a lot of classes and I store variables in other places
[17:33:33] <coldhead> or $(el).appendTo('#wherever').on('click', ...)
[17:33:58] <g0th> so I have to do .on _after_ I inserted it?
[17:34:05] <g0th> it doesn't work if I do it beforehand?
[17:34:05] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[17:34:17] <coldhead> i'm not sure about HAVE to, g0th, but it certainly works that way
[17:34:38] <coldhead> how rude, caniuse
[17:34:57] <g0th> the thing is: it takes a while until everything is finally added to the document body
[17:35:11] <g0th> but I would like to define the click function at the time I define the element
[17:35:29] <g0th> otherwise I have to keep references to all things taht I want to add click functions on
[17:35:59] <coldhead> g0th: the jquery way would be to bind your events using a selector
[17:36:18] <coldhead> like $('div.someclass').on('click', ...)
[17:36:26] <coldhead> and that will work for all matching someclass divs
[17:36:29] <coldhead> whenever they are added
[17:36:45] <coldhead> binding to elements directly is different
[17:36:50] <WebDragon> can a single call to toggleClass() toggle two classes at once? (in my case, one off, and another on) or should I just chain two calls
[17:36:51] <coldhead> and more of a pain in the ass
[17:37:06] <coldhead> WebDragon: toggleClass('aids lol toggle all these')
[17:37:08] <coldhead> it's fine
[17:37:14] <WebDragon> sweetness
[17:37:42] <g0th> coldhead: I would need to go into details to explain...
[17:37:42] <coldhead> fuck you cunning aspirants nearly made me forget the net.art i came online to code >: |
[17:37:43] <g0th> hmm
[17:37:58] <coldhead> g0th: i am going to try a quick experiment
[17:38:25] <g0th> coldhead: I have a visual representation of "actions" (up to 2000), they are all divs, and a click on one of them should select it
[17:38:42] <g0th> or drawing a rectangle should select it if it is "inside" it
[17:39:01] <rich_> Hello. i have a website und and the phpbb forum on a subdomain. forum.website.com. i want to do an login with jquery (.post) from the website. But with jquery it doesent wok, if i build the request with php and fsockopen it works. I hope some could give me tipps what im doing wrong. Here are the two request  http://pastebin.com/kv2CJnr0
[17:39:17] <g0th> also ctrl/shift should act as remove/add to existing selection and otherwise it should just forget the old selection
[17:40:14] <adept-phil> Hi all. I think I've missunderstood something along the way. Can anyone tell me why the following doesn't work? I'm trying to append something to every 1st <li> within every <ul> with the class="portfolio". It works for the first <ul> but not the second?
[17:40:14] <adept-phil> http://jsfiddle.net/PveWT/1/
[17:40:31] <g0th> coldhead: I have code to add/remove action and I planned to add the "click" stuff during the creation in that code
[17:40:36] <coldhead> g0th: http://jsfiddle.net/FfyzP/
[17:41:28] <coldhead> you can bind and attach later
[17:41:31] <coldhead> it works fine
[17:42:02] <coldhead> adept-phil: eq(0) gets the first and ONLY the first of the entire set
[17:42:05] <coldhead> not EVERY first
[17:42:15] <coldhead> for that you something more like
[17:42:18] <coldhead> ?nth-child
[17:42:18] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:42:51] <creative__> hey guys
[17:42:59] <creative__> im having a problem with jquery accordion
[17:43:01] <creative__> :/
[17:43:32] <creative__> do you know the best place to get help
[17:44:22] <coldhead> ?demo @ creative__
[17:44:22] <bot-t> creative__, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:44:32] <coldhead> then share the link here
[17:44:39] <creative__> i can provide the link
[17:44:41] <coldhead> and if no one helps, post to the jQuery forums
[17:44:43] <creative__> i have it live
[17:44:47] <coldhead> cool
[17:44:54] <creative__> can i pm you the link?
[17:44:58] <coldhead> certainly not
[17:45:05] <creative__> oops
[17:45:06] <coldhead> i have to work on something much more important now
[17:45:06] <creative__> sorry
[17:45:15] <adept-phil> coldhead: cheers fella ;)
[17:45:16] <coldhead> but paste it here and someone will help!
[17:45:21] <creative__> sorry
[17:45:22] <creative__> i mean
[17:45:28] <creative__> its safe to post it in this room?
[17:45:31] <coldhead> use bit.ly to obscure the link if you're paranoid
[17:45:41] <coldhead> of course it's safe! it's a room of people who want to help you!
[17:45:45] <creative__> lol
[17:45:46] <creative__> cool
[17:45:54] <tw2113> except for that guy *points*
[17:46:02] <tw2113> he wants to XSS your code
[17:46:04] <coldhead> except for the evil motherfuckers, yes
[17:46:05] <creative__> (:
[17:46:15] <coldhead> but those guys can eat hot dicks
[17:46:26] <creative__> im using a theme, and the theme creator refuses to answer my question
[17:46:30] <creative__> but he answers everyone else
[17:46:30] * tw2113 hopes there aren't any metrosexuals named richard in here
[17:46:36] <creative__> i think because he doesnt know how to fix it
[17:46:46] <creative__> ive tried upgrading jquery accordion but it breaks my css
[17:46:55] <creative__> i'll show you the link
[17:47:36] <g0th> coldhead: and if I change the position it still works on the new position?
[17:47:48] <coldhead> ?tias @ g0th
[17:47:49] <bot-t> g0th, Try It And See
[17:47:54] <coldhead> that's what i'd do :)
[17:48:11] <g0th> what about removal?
[17:48:16] <g0th> will it deactivate the events?
[17:48:24] <creative__> http://demo12.creativestudio.ie/faq/
[17:48:54] <creative__> when the page loads, the accordions all open, and then close once it's fully loaded. i want it to remain closed while loading
[17:52:48] <creative__> i know its not the most up to date jquery accordion
[17:53:12] <creative__> but i think it's something in the jquery-ui.js that needs to be changed
[17:53:22] <creative__> if only i knew which to change
[17:53:35] <creative__> i been playing around with it but cant get it
[17:55:20] <nmittal> i am seeing weird behavior with dialogbox.. it lets me resize the width as much as i want but for height it shows a scroll bar after a point.. does anyone know what this is?
[17:58:20] <coldhead> g0th: depends how you remove
[17:58:25] <coldhead> check the docs
[17:58:26] <coldhead> ?remove
[17:58:26] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[17:58:35] <coldhead> that lets you ditch the events if desired
[17:58:37] <nmittal> here is a screenshot if someone wants to see... http://i43.tinypic.com/29443o3.png
[17:58:43] <g0th> ok
[17:58:58] <coldhead> here is the chrome net.art i had to make http://jsfiddle.net/dPgrX/3/show/
[17:59:02] <g0th> is it a performance issue to add a lot of .on's?
[17:59:24] <g0th> nice
[17:59:27] <coldhead> g0th: if you're planning to add 2000...
[17:59:31] <coldhead> yeah that could be a perf issue
[17:59:50] <g0th> hmm, why?
[17:59:55] <coldhead> g0th: couldn't you have a single function that worked with any element
[18:00:08] <coldhead> and it could acces the specific element with `this`
[18:00:15] <anphonic_> $($dailyOutput).find('http://').replaceWith('https://');  that SHOULD replace all http:// with https correct?
[18:00:16] <coldhead> and toggle whatever you need to toglle
[18:00:19] <coldhead> to include it?
[18:00:26] <coldhead> then you'd only need one function
[18:00:28] <g0th> I would need to go through all or at least quite some elements
[18:00:44] <g0th> and compare their position/etc to check if I matched one when clicking on it or selecting
[18:00:44] <coldhead> well if the 2000 is simpler then do it that way
[18:00:49] <coldhead> i've never tried that many handlers
[18:00:52] <g0th> certainly simpler
[18:00:55] <coldhead> but i expect it might be slow
[18:01:09] <g0th> only 1 of the 2000 will be in range of the click
[18:01:23] <g0th> but will it be O(n) when I click or O(1)?
[18:01:25] <coldhead> but i think jQuery will have to catch each event
[18:01:33] <coldhead> and then test each of 2000 functions
[18:01:35] <g0th> O(n)? omg
[18:01:37] <coldhead> to see if its the one
[18:01:40] <coldhead> BUT
[18:01:45] <coldhead> i don't KNOW that
[18:01:51] <g0th> who knows? ^^
[18:01:59] <coldhead> i don't know how jQuery actually does the event binding when you work with native elements
[18:02:06] <coldhead> g0th: you will know
[18:02:10] <coldhead> you will either tias
[18:02:11] <coldhead> OR
[18:02:14] <coldhead> read the source :)
[18:02:22] <g0th> ^^
[18:02:34] <g0th> that's why I come here, to hopefully get a faster answer :)
[18:02:42] <coldhead> wrong time of day, friend
[18:02:51] <g0th> ok ok, thx anyway :)
[18:02:54] <coldhead> the jQuery devs are all in their friday nights
[18:02:58] <coldhead> after epic work weeks
[18:03:06] <anphonic_> <-- wishes he was on his friday night
[18:03:07] <coldhead> probably drunk off their asses at stripclubs
[18:03:14] <anphonic_> <-- wish that too
[18:03:15] <anphonic_> lol
[18:03:32] <anphonic_> instead, writing an abstract for a database class
[18:03:37] <rich_>  i have a website und and the phpbb forum on a subdomain. forum.website.com. i want to do an login with jquery (.post) from the website. But with jquery it doesent wok, if i build the request with php and fsockopen it works. I hope some could give me tipps what im doing wrong. Here are the two request  http://pastebin.com/kv2CJnr0
[18:04:07] <rich_> here is the way i have tried it with jquery http://pastebin.com/61U8Pm9Z
[18:05:36] <coldhead> ?sop workarounds @ rich_
[18:05:37] <bot-t> rich_, workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[18:05:49] <coldhead> maybe it's that?
[18:06:03] <coldhead> i'm guessing without looking at your code
[18:07:33] <anphonic_> yql is quite nice. i only wish i had paid more attention to it days ago
[18:11:42] <creative__> anyone got an idea of what to do with http://demo12.creativestudio.ie/faq/
[18:11:49] <creative__> accodrion opens when loading then closes
[18:11:54] <creative__> i want it closed while loading page
[18:12:16] <creative__> accordion*
[18:12:49] <creative__> its a lot more noticable on internet explorer and firefox than on chrome
[18:13:35] <Lonestar99> i have the following code which i am adding an image src dynamically but not sure what is going on -->http://jsfiddle.net/SzfBU/
[18:16:37] <Guest56821> Hi. I have a $("#target").mousemove(function(p1) wrapped around a $("#target").mouseleave(function(p2, p1), but p1 is seemingly not being passed to mouseleave(). Im pretty sure Im doing this the wrong way. Could anyone please give me a hand?
[18:24:16] <anphonic_> Lonestar99: http://jsfiddle.net/anphonic/SzfBU/1/
[18:24:56] <anphonic_> creative__: Sorry but that s beyond my ability in the short time i have
[18:25:22] <Lonestar99> anphonic_: thank you very much
[18:25:45] <anphonic_> np, you just had the attr incorrect
[18:25:53] <anphonic_> see the changes?
[18:26:00] <Lonestar99> would have never guessed ,uri0+
[18:26:06] <anphonic_> :)
[18:26:11] <Lonestar99> thanks
[18:26:13] <anphonic_> np
[18:27:23] <anphonic_> $($dailyOutput).find('http://').replaceWith('https://');  that SHOULD replace all http:// with https correct?
[18:30:30] <yoasif> hey -- id like to make it so that only the ron paul link has the class applied (so it only applies to places where the link doesn't have any text nodes surrounding it) -- fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/MzdKT/ any ideas?
[18:34:16] <anphonic_> http://jsfiddle.net/anphonic/MzdKT/1/
[18:34:26] <anphonic_> yoasif: ^^
[18:35:44] <yoasif> anphonic_: yeah --- i wanted to generalize it -- i can't depend on the link to have any consistent value in there -- i need a way to look at the surrounding text nodes
[18:37:15] <anphonic_> ?parent
[18:37:16] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[18:37:36] <Eviltwin> ?contents
[18:37:37] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[18:39:29] <anphonic_> ah i understand what you mean now
[18:40:06] <yoasif> yeah
[18:41:24] <yoasif> basically the use case is that i want to be able to post a link to my cms on a single line (wrapped in a p) and have jquery act on it, but not apply to paragraphs with text surrounding the link
[18:44:04] <nishttal2> guys how do i connect to the processing.js channel
[18:44:21] <nishttal2> i am new to IRC and dont know how to connect to that server
[18:44:23] <nishttal2> can someone help

[18:50:27] <benzrf> hello
[18:50:34] <benzrf> Really stupid question:

[18:51:06] <benzrf> ?
[18:51:25] <benzrf> >:C
[18:51:46] <benzrf> Is anyone here not afk?!?
[18:51:58] * benzrf groans
[19:01:41] <astropirate> 10 billion to the first person to answer why I'm so awesome
[19:02:05] <VernonK> Because you're not only a Pirate but freakin Astro too!
[19:03:06] <astropirate> that is but a small part of the reason
[19:06:33] <jacof> astropirate because you're not not awesome
[19:07:42] <anphonic_> you just robbed a bank with a toothpick, a dirty sock, and a hair with split ends. All while never even knowing the location of the bank?
[19:09:08] <astropirate> jacof, this is madness!
[19:09:32] <astropirate> haha nice one anphonic_
[19:10:31] <anphonic_> :) was i close?!?!
[19:11:40] <astropirate> no

[19:13:21] <anphonic_> thank you.
[19:16:48] <abjorn> imsky: what are you doing here on a friday night, sir, you're never here on friday nights
[19:16:49] <bot-t> (5 hours 12 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn lol i forgot what we were talking about
[19:19:28] <coldhead> you crazy stoners
[19:21:33] <anphonic_> ok so i realized why its not finding any http:// in my script, because when i run the check there isnt any
[19:21:41] <anphonic_> just html and variable names
[19:21:42] <shoky> ok
[19:22:53] <anphonic_> so should i do something like var link2 = $(link1).find('http://'.replaceWith('https://');  ?
[19:22:57] <anphonic_> would that work?
[19:23:33] <shoky> does it
[19:23:53] <anphonic_> dunno yet, working a other things and it just hit me so i tabbed lol
[19:24:22] <shoky> wa
[19:24:22] <shoky> t
[19:24:30] <shoky> ?find
[19:24:30] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:34:42] <imsky> abjorn: lol whats up
[19:38:17] <abjorn> not much, imsky, watching top gear, talking to people, and sippin on some mixed drink my sister made that I forgot the name of
[19:38:51] <imsky> cool story brah
[19:38:57] <Eviltwin> abjorn: Is it a grasshopper?
[19:38:57] <Guest5840> How can I get the return value of the function that jquery's ajax calls on success?
[19:39:02] <imsky> this irc has been running for years apparently
[19:39:14] <Eviltwin> Guest5840: You can't directly
[19:40:46] <Guest5840> hmmm...so any thoughts on how I could do it indirectly? Or is the fact that i'm trying this in the first place a sign of bigger problems?
[19:41:26] <Eviltwin> Maybe you could make a jsFiddle demo of what you have right now
[19:41:30] <Eviltwin> And what you're trying to do
[19:41:54] <Guest5840> ok
[19:43:39] <anphonic_> Sounds kinda how I started with my weather widget
[19:44:19] <anphonic_> i should really convert it to php, now that I have it working in jquery, that way I can cache the results for a bit at least
[19:45:40] <anphonic_> Eviltwin: I did finally get something working :) made the boss super happy. esp since the company we're getting weather from wanted 1k - 1500 to create one for us
[19:46:31] <Eviltwin> anphonic_: I wrote a program that did basically someone's entire job
[19:46:37] <Eviltwin> A full-time salary position too
[19:46:42] <anphonic_> haha nice
[19:46:45] <Eviltwin> I wrote it because I thought it would be helpful
[19:46:53] <Eviltwin> I was worried she would lose her job after I did
[19:46:54] <yoasif> guy got fired?
[19:47:05] <anphonic_> ah yeah that would be a big deal
[19:47:22] <Eviltwin> I think she picked up more work from her coworkers in her department
[19:47:25] <abjorn> Eviltwin: I...don't think so
[19:47:30] <anphonic_> next, i really need to make it into a joomla module really
[19:47:35] <Eviltwin> anphonic_: What's in it?
[19:47:38] <Eviltwin> Err
[19:47:39] <anphonic_> right now, having ti iframe it
[19:47:39] <Eviltwin> abjorn: What's in it?
[19:47:55] <abjorn> dunno!
[19:48:03] <abjorn> alcohol!
[19:48:06] <abjorn> sweet stuff!
[19:48:14] <abjorn> potentially other ingredients!
[19:48:15] <Eviltwin> What color is the mixture?
[19:48:28] <abjorn> brownish
[19:49:03] <Eviltwin> Well that's narrowed the search to about 85% of what it was
[19:49:18] <anphonic_> lol
[19:50:31] <Guest5840> Ok here it is, hopefully clears up what I want to do. http://jsfiddle.net/DD2df/2/
[19:51:50] <Guest5840> It doesn't work of course, just trying to get the idea across.
[19:53:49] <Eviltwin> dude_guy: Okay, this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/DD2df/3/
[19:57:41] <dude_guy> Thanks, trying it out now.
[20:01:22] <chadkouse> hey guys I'm having a problem with a jsonp ajax call
[20:01:30] <chadkouse> i've used jsonlint to verify my json is well formed
[20:01:38] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ chadkouse
[20:01:39] <bot-t> chadkouse, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:01:41] <chadkouse> but I still get into my error handler every time
[20:01:52] <chadkouse> k sec.
[20:03:43] <dude_guy> Eviltwin: hmmm. Getting "cannot call method done on undefined".
[20:05:13] <dude_guy> Eviltwin: I will keep at it, thank you for your help though! :)
[20:06:24] <Eviltwin> dude_guy: Are you sure you copied what I wrote correctly?
[20:08:41] <dude_guy> Eviltwin: derp, didn't see your return result at the bottom....
[20:09:24] <dude_guy> Eviltwin: Thanks so much. That is exactly what I needed.
[20:09:30] <Eviltwin> Cool
[20:12:59] <chadkouse> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/aNNDQ/
[20:17:56] <anphonic_> well darn, looks I get to keep learning more jquery/php/etc since I didn't win the megamillions
[20:19:00] <Eviltwin> chadkouse: Have you read this? see ?ajax
[20:19:01] <bot-t> chadkouse, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:19:29] <Eviltwin> BTW, http://jsfiddle.net/aNNDQ/1/
[20:21:45] <chadkouse> Eviltwin: this is what I get back from my server:
[20:21:46] <chadkouse> http://pastie.org/private/c59wc18qsg16thtq5yhgw
[20:21:55] <chadkouse> it looks legit to me.. and I get a status 200
[20:22:22] <chadkouse> i can make my jsonfiddle work if I add ?callback=? to the url (in my original)
[20:23:18] <chadkouse> and yeah I've read the jquery docs
[20:24:47] <Eviltwin> chadkouse: There's a "?" at the beginning of your callback?
[20:25:05] <chadkouse> it's just the first query string param
[20:25:30] <chadkouse> otherwise it would be ?foo=123&callback=?
[20:26:06] <chadkouse> it's like jquery isn't passing on the callback function to the server.
[20:26:21] <chadkouse> my server comes back with ?({…..})
[20:26:33] <Eviltwin> When you specify "?callback=?", jQuery goes in and replaces that second ? with a real callback name
[20:26:37] <Eviltwin> And your server needs to respect that
[20:27:13] <chadkouse> ah I think I figured it out
[20:27:29] <chadkouse> I was building the URL outside of the $.ajax() context
[20:27:34] <chadkouse> and i guess using the ? there doesn't work
[20:27:54] <Validatorian> anyone know how I would loop over each item under 'facebook'? https://gist.github.com/77ea7ddd9195946806e5 -- doing $(obj.feed.facebook).each(...) doesn't appear to be working.
[20:28:18] <Eviltwin> $.each(obj.feed.facebook, ...)
[20:28:29] <Validatorian> that didn't work either
[20:28:45] <chadkouse> Eviltwin: like this: http://pastie.org/private/3kahcsimsp8m32ucvzmdw
[20:28:53] <Validatorian> and from what I understand $(selector).each() would be fine, as that's specifically for objects
[20:29:09] <chadkouse> oops that was wrong
[20:29:44] <Eviltwin> Try $.each(obj.feed.facebook[""], ...)
[20:29:48] <Eviltwin> I have no idea why you have that there
[20:29:49] <chadkouse> Eviltwin: http://pastie.org/private/tetpnlmvibacwaxo9vgvgw
[20:29:59] <chadkouse> do you know if using the ? outside of the $.ajax context just doesn't work?
[20:30:03] <chadkouse> (it seems like it doesn't)
[20:30:03] <Eviltwin> chadkouse: Okay, the problem is it's going to do this:
[20:30:11] <Eviltwin> ?js $.param({"callback": "?"})
[20:30:14] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "callback=%3F"
[20:30:20] <Eviltwin> It'll escape the ?
[20:30:31] <Eviltwin> That's the reason you actually need to concatenate it yourself
[20:30:38] <Eviltwin> So that it's not escaped
[20:30:43] <Eviltwin> And can be recognized
[20:31:02] <chadkouse> ahhhh
[20:31:11] <chadkouse> you're right.. my function escapes any getParam value
[20:31:21] <chadkouse> thank you very much I can fix this easily then
[20:32:35] <Validatorian> Eviltwin: Me neighther :-/ Dealing with an existing API. Thanks for your help!
[20:53:02] <quuxman> For some reason when I use .hover(), I get hover-intent behavior, where the handlers are called after a short delay, or not at all if the cursor passes over the element quickly
[20:53:06] <quuxman> I don't want this
[20:53:36] <astropirate> quuxman, try mouseover
[20:53:38] <astropirate> or mouseenter
[20:54:06] <quuxman> same thing with mouseover and mouseout (.hover() is an alias for calling both of those), and mousenter and mouseleave
[20:55:14] <astropirate> i got nothing then
[20:55:19] <quuxman> oh duh, I have a plugin that clobbers the original over
[21:04:25] <quuxman> nevermind, it only clobbers .hover. If I use mouseenter and mouseleave, it has the normal responsiveness
[21:12:19] <xxtjaxx> Hi! Can I somehow enforce non-standard href behaviour? As in don't go to #id if href tells you to? Is that possible to do in the click() method?
[21:13:11] <anphonic_> ?preventDefault
[21:13:12] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[21:14:47] <xxtjaxx> anphonic_: thanks!
[21:14:53] <anphonic_> np
[22:06:51] <xxtjaxx> anphonic_: Interesting preventDefault appears to be broken for mozilla
[22:07:25] <Eviltwin> preventDefault is broken for Mozilla?
[22:07:32] <Eviltwin> How have you established this?
[22:26:56] <r500> www.bytecyclist.com/2009/08/09/jmonthcalendar-options-events-methods-documentation/comment-page-1/#comments any idea how do i get the  on click of division(cell) the date of that cell
