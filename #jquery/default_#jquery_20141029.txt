[00:11:26] <Cork> Dxchat: prop('checked', true/false)
[00:12:06] <Dxchat> Thanks cork, but how to get the value from select
[00:12:19] <Cork> Dxchat: .val()
[00:12:22] <Dxchat> can you please give me a working example?
[00:13:55] <Cork> Dxchat: just select the select box and do .val()
[00:14:02] <Cork> it's as simple as that
[00:14:39] <Dxchat> am new to jquery please help..http://jsfiddle.net/mgpswwp5/
[00:15:09] <Cork> Dxchat: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[00:23:30] <Dxchat> i'm dumb enough to understand that..anyway thanks for your hepl ;(
[00:42:31] <soomro786> How can i run a function when append() is run
[00:42:51] <soomro786> Like on click but on append
[00:42:59] <Cork> soomro786: you could try wrapping the append function
[00:43:38] <soomro786> Do u have an example
[00:43:39] <Cork> (function() { var org = $.fn.append; $.fn.append = function() { org.apply(this, arguments); }; })();
[00:44:05] <Cork> note you should try to avoid this if possible
[00:44:14] <soomro786> Yeah i wanna avoid that
[00:44:17] <Cork> have the function calling append notify you instead
[00:44:27] <soomro786> I wanna find another way around if
[00:44:31] <soomro786> It*
[00:44:43] <Cork> there are none cross browsers
[00:45:01] <Cork> some modern browsers has MutationObservers
[00:45:09] <Cork> but ya, not usable yet
[00:45:25] <soomro786> Amd .watch
[00:45:34] <soomro786> But not cross browser
[00:45:38] <Cork> well that is even less supported
[00:45:52] <Cork> and it mainly to watch values not function calls
[00:46:04] <soomro786> There needs to br something like it
[00:46:08] <soomro786> Afterall this is javascript
[00:46:09] <soomro786> Haha
[00:46:15] <Cork> there isn't
[00:46:24] <soomro786> Wish there was
[00:46:24] <Cork> the line i gave you works
[00:46:32] <Cork> and it is the closest you will find
[00:46:50] <Cork> it's only drawback is that you get a new function pointer in $.fn.apply
[00:46:53] <Cork> *append
[00:47:02] <Cork> not a big problem, but a possible one
[00:47:48] <soomro786> I guess wrap append in a function and have that function run something everytime its called
[00:48:39] <Cork> soomro786: the line replaces the $.fn.append function with a new one
[00:48:43] <Cork> and calls the original one
[00:48:54] <Cork> it lets you do things before/after the original function is called
[00:49:16] <soomro786> I dont wanna replace the function
[00:49:26] <soomro786> Need it to be cross platform browser
[00:49:31] <Cork> and is the cleanest you can get if you need to have it happen on calls to $().append
[00:49:48] <Cork> soomro786: your filter results in zero matches
[00:49:55] <Cork> you need to remove one of them
[01:51:48] * CssNoob Could somebody throw me some advice I'm applying for an internship for a front-end developer job how much would it be the exact rate for an internship salary
[01:53:29] <Uhkis> CssNoob: depends on so many things
[01:55:19] <slax0r> why not just ask on the interview?
[01:56:04] * CssNoob Uhkis The HR emailed me today asking how much would be my rate for an internship. I want to be a front end dev though its a home based internship

[01:56:42] <neil2> is there a forum for jtable?
[01:57:38] <slax0r> CssNoob: you do know you don't have to use /me every time you write, right? and it's hard to say how much you can ask, since we don't know where the company is located
[01:57:53] <slax0r> it could be 2keur in once place and it could be only 300eur in other

[02:01:08] <slax0r> hi Cork
[02:01:13] <Cork> o/
[02:07:07] <hactor> Hey guys is there a solid *guarantee* by jQuery that if I select a bunch of nodes, they'll be ordered in the pseudo-array the way they come naturally in DOM?
[02:07:21] <CssNoob> thanks slax0r
[02:07:29] <Cork> hactor: yes
[02:07:48] <hactor> Cork! nice! where in the doc is this described, I can't find it :( ideas
[02:07:48] <Cork> actually the dom does this, and jquery just guarantees not to mess it up
[02:08:27] <hactor> All righ
[02:08:27] <Cork> hactor: ugg was a LONG time since i read this
[02:08:27] <hactor> t
[02:08:32] <hactor> :}
[02:08:35] <hactor> Thanks
[02:08:35] <Cork> can't link you
[02:08:45] <Cork> (try over 5 years)
[02:08:48] <hactor> !
[02:30:19] <BrazenBraden> strange situation.. I have a div and a button. when the button is clicked, I wasnt to append some content which is ajax loaded in into the container div. It does it once for the first click of the button but every click of the button after that, it loads in the ajax'd view overwriting the initial one.
[02:31:01] <BrazenBraden> https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/1fbe431649b01fc9006c
[02:34:52] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you most likely bind the event on the button
[02:34:57] <Cork> and the ajax replaces the button
[02:35:11] <Cork> either don't replace the button, or use a delegated event listener
[02:35:28] <BrazenBraden> the button doesnt change. it's outside of the ajax'd content
[02:35:53] <Cork> is the event handler called on the second click?
[02:36:40] <BrazenBraden> yes. it fires a console.log on every click
[02:41:51] <Cork> BrazenBraden: ok, then start from there and check where it fails
[02:42:39] <BrazenBraden> well, technically it isnt failing. the button click is registered, the ajax call is done and the content is loaded... but its almost like it is doing a container.html() instad of container.append()
[02:43:04] <Cork> BrazenBraden: not sure what AjaxLoad does
[02:43:10] <Cork> that isn't a jquery function
[02:43:14] <BrazenBraden> its basically a wrapper around $.load
[02:43:23] <Cork> why arn't you using it?
[02:43:31] <Cork> $().load that is
[02:43:46] <Cork> also .load replaces the content
[02:43:54] <BrazenBraden> because I add a bit more to what happens after the content is loaded. initializing thingies
[02:44:08] <Cork> BrazenBraden: actually
[02:44:10] <BrazenBraden> oh..
[02:44:15] <BrazenBraden> umm
[02:44:18] <Cork> you run a function in .append
[02:44:26] <Cork> but you never return anything from the function
[02:44:34] <Cork> so .append doesn't do anything
[02:44:39] <Cork> (ajax can't return)
[02:44:43] <BrazenBraden> well, lemme update gist with my AjaxLoad function
[02:44:49] <Cork> what you want to do, is use $.get instead
[02:44:54] <BrazenBraden> it returns the content of the loaded view
[02:44:59] <Cork> and then .append from inside AjaxLoad
[02:45:05] <Cork> you can't return from ajax
[02:45:15] <Cork> you need to move the append
[02:45:52] <Cork> BrazenBraden: AjaxLoad($('.admin_user_permission_system_container'), path, $.noop);
[02:46:20] <Cork> and inside AjaxLoad firstArg.append(html)
[02:46:49] <BrazenBraden> that sounds tricksy
[02:47:02] <BrazenBraden> hist updated with ajaxload btw
[02:47:06] <BrazenBraden> *gist
[02:48:10] <Cork> ok
[02:48:33] <Cork> wait a min
[02:49:01] <BrazenBraden> it used to do things like append a spinner to the element while the content was loading.. remove the spinner afterwards etc.. Reload(); re-initialises a bunch of things like date masks, select2 etc
[02:49:04] <Cork> BrazenBraden: so ya, .load is the problem here
[02:49:27] <BrazenBraden> so if I changed that tro .get it would fix it?
[02:49:28] <Cork> for future reference, use one of these pastbins
[02:49:29] <Cork> ?paste
[02:49:29] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:49:38] <Cork> makes answering your questions MUCH simpler
[02:49:45] <BrazenBraden> really? I thought gist was the general prefered one?
[02:49:50] <Cork> no
[02:49:53] <Cork> cause it is read only
[02:50:03] <BrazenBraden> oh. the guys on #RubyOnRails wont take anything else lol
[02:50:08] <BrazenBraden> ahh right
[02:50:27] <BrazenBraden> but wait... you can edit a gist (or at least comment on it) no?
[02:50:46] <Hejkki> lollards
[02:51:22] <Cork> BrazenBraden: http://jsfiddle.net/seofktc5/
[02:51:28] <Cork> that should solve your problem
[02:51:54] <Cork> BrazenBraden: AjaxLoad($('.admin_user_permission_system_container'), path, function(data) { this.append(data); });
[02:51:57] <BrazenBraden> is there something I would lose out on from using .get instead of .load ?
[02:52:18] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you lost out of the automatic $(target).html(data);
[02:52:24] <Cork> internally it is the same call
[02:54:02] <Cork> to be a bit more precise both $.get and $().load uses $.ajax
[02:54:09] <BrazenBraden> ok. small question. if I left it as el.load() and did the append inside the function, would that still end up replacing the previous content?
[02:54:23] <Cork> yes
[02:54:26] <BrazenBraden> ok
[02:54:27] <Cork> cause .load runs .html
[02:54:39] <Cork> you would end up adding the same content twice
[02:54:44] <Cork> on time replaces the old
[02:54:49] <Cork> and then you append it again after
[02:54:56] <BrazenBraden> I see
[02:55:02] <Cork> BrazenBraden: the entire point of .load is to replace the content
[02:55:26] <BrazenBraden> fun story, now my app doesnt work lol
[02:55:29] <Cork> BrazenBraden: for reference http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=load
[02:55:31] <Cork> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.get
[02:55:53] <Cork> BrazenBraden: did you remove the old .append(function() code?
[02:56:17] <BrazenBraden> yes. it doesnt do the ajax get
[02:57:23] <Cork> how far does it get?
[02:58:26] <BrazenBraden> well,m I have a lot of ajax load going on everywhere. i click a button to "add new user". that loads in the users/new view. in there, there is a button to add permissions. that ajax loads in the permissions view. that has a select. on change, that ajax loads in the specific permission view selected lol
[02:58:48] <BrazenBraden> lol
[02:59:11] <BrazenBraden> just for funsies, i changed it back to $.load in AjaxLoad and left the append code as you suggested it
[02:59:20] <BrazenBraden> it loads the view INSIDE the button :P
[02:59:40] <BrazenBraden> thats my failt
[02:59:43] <BrazenBraden> one sec
[03:02:58] <garethdaine> Guys, I have a multistep form and I want to validate whether a radio button has been selected before moving on to the next step. I’d like to do this on button click (next button). Do you guys have any pointers?
[03:03:09] <BrazenBraden> ya ok. fixed the append into the button but yes you are correct, the .load is still replacing the content.
[03:03:35] <BrazenBraden> Cork, I had an idea...
[03:04:07] <BrazenBraden> what if, on button click, I append an empty div to the container. then I do the AjaxLoad into that empty div instead of directly into the container?
[03:05:11] <Cork> BrazenBraden: its an option, though i don't see the point
[03:05:23] <Cork> it adds extra complexity for little reason
[03:05:55] <BrazenBraden> changing .load to .get seems to change too many things.. would rather just work around it because this is the only instance I have come across so far (in a year of working on this project) that I am doing this
[03:08:15] <hactor> $('<div />') <-- is the XHTML syntax officially supported, even though we no longer use XHTML?
[03:08:28] <hactor> In jQuery specifically
[03:12:09] <davetarmac> hey guys
[03:13:33] <davetarmac> is there a nice easy way to check the id of the clicked element?
[03:15:58] <hactor> davetarmac, this.id  :) or.. $(this).attr('id')
[03:21:09] <Xatenev> Heya
[03:21:27] <Xatenev> A question - how do i set the jquery.datepicker to display the date in another format
[03:25:56] <hactor> folks, I know "this" in a click handler is bound to the element clicked on. I have this bound to something else (typescript), which property in the Event is exactly the same thing?
[03:28:05] <Erwat> i don't understand testing quite well
[03:28:41] <Erwat> like i don't see what i would conceivably write tests for or even how
[03:28:58] <Erwat> i have no clue how i would even access anything in the structure of an application that runs
[03:29:14] <Erwat> i mean sure, ican get some elements but i have no idea how i would even get close to the code that i would want to specifically test
[03:29:24] <Erwat> are some types of applications just much harder to test?
[03:29:38] <hactor> Erwat, why are you asking this here
[03:29:46] <Erwat> nevermind then, sorry for asking
[03:29:48] <Erwat> fuck tests
[03:30:04] <hactor> Erwat, well FYI, UI applications are not supposed to be tested automatically for the most part.
[03:30:14] <hactor> Erwat, here's how to think about it.
[03:30:23] <hactor> Erwat, you want editing code not to break it right
[03:30:30] <hactor> ?
[03:31:29] <hactor> Erwat, I can get you some clarity, play with me
[03:31:33] <Cork> hackeron: there isn't an exact same in event
[03:31:44] <Cork> the closest you can get is event.target
[03:31:54] <Cork> but it is the even source
[03:31:58] <Cork> not the one with the even listener
[03:32:04] <Cork> *event
[03:32:17] <Erwat> hactor: nah, it's okay. sorry for asking.
[03:32:32] <hactor> *shrug*
[03:32:35] <Cork> hackeron: you should prob try to not kill this for event handlers
[03:32:43] <Cork> it isn't a good idea
[03:33:00] <hactor> Cork, I use TypeScript, so it binds it to creation context, which frankly is also useful (not that I have a choice)
[03:33:15] <hactor> Cork, however I found it's identical to event.currentTarget
[03:33:21] <Cork> hactor: you could pass it to event.data
[03:33:47] <hactor> Cork, I don't wrap the handler, just when I type "this" in TypeScript it internally compiles it as "that" (figuratively speaking)
[03:34:14] <Cork> hactor: ah, i expected it to use .bind
[03:34:33] <hactor> Nah TS uses very minimal patterns, it's amazing for the most part.
[03:34:37] <Cork> hactor: i know use js directly instead of abstracting it? ;P
[03:35:05] <hactor> Cork, it doesn't abstract it, it's just arrow functions.
[03:35:11] <hactor> Cork, they'll work like this in ES6 too
[03:35:15] <Cork> i put typescript in the same pile as coffiescript => making things complicated
[03:35:22] <Cork> hactor: no
[03:35:30] <hactor> Cork, don't put it in the same pile, a big mistake.
[03:35:43] <Cork> hactor: i've looked into it
[03:35:48] <Cork> it isn't from an external view
[03:35:59] <hactor> Cork, unlike CoffeeScript, TS *is* JavaScript.
[03:36:06] <hactor> you paste JS in it, it works
[03:36:08] <Cork> no
[03:36:14] <Cork> typescript is a different language
[03:36:21] <Cork> for example it has typed variables
[03:36:25] <hactor> Apparently you haven't looked much into it.
[03:36:28] <Cork> (as the name implies)
[03:36:31] <hactor> Yes this is called a superset
[03:36:31] <Cork> i have
[03:36:38] <Cork> it extends it
[03:37:02] <hactor> I've never, in my life written over 300+ lines of JS and have them run right on first run
[03:37:05] <Cork> typescript is trying to make javascript more comfortable for c++ developers basically
[03:37:11] <hactor> This is normal stuff in TS to happen
[03:37:12] <Cork> and that is about all it does
[03:37:26] <hactor> I write, it catches all my mistakes as I type and tells me how to fix them.
[03:37:31] <hactor> I refresh in the browser, it runs
[03:37:36] <hactor> It's ... startling
[03:38:08] <Cork> and it adds an additional layer of abstraction
[03:38:19] <hactor> Cork, you're mistaken, but I won't argue further. You need to sit down and try it in a real project before you dismiss it so arrogantly. Even Google and Facebook has adopted it
[03:38:20] <Cork> so when you need to debug you have to either convert javascript back to typescript
[03:38:25] <Cork> or learn to debug the generated js
[03:38:28] <Cork> making life hard
[03:38:33] <hactor> Cork, wrong again.
[03:38:35] <hactor> Two things.
[03:38:37] <Cork> heh
[03:38:38] <Cork> no
[03:38:57] <Cork> hactor: if i was wrong the browsers would have to natively support typescript
[03:38:57] <hactor> First, the JS generated by TS is very readable, nesting and all. Even comments. It's 95% your JS. Especially the bodies of methods.
[03:38:59] <Cork> something they don't
[03:39:01] <FilipNortic> Is there a non ajax way to send soap request to another server or do I have to do it server side? I've never dealt with soap before but it seems I have to now
[03:39:07] <hactor> Cork, have you heard of .map files?
[03:39:12] <Cork> hactor: yes
[03:39:16] <hactor> Cork I *am* debugging TypeScript right in my browser
[03:39:19] <Cork> and that is the "convertion" i talked about before
[03:39:33] <hactor> Cork, you make it sound like "work", but it's transparent.
[03:39:42] <hactor> Cork, I save TS file, I debug it in the browser.
[03:39:44] <hactor> That's it
[03:39:45] <Cork> hactor: abstraction languages works well until something breaks
[03:39:55] <Cork> and that is when life becomes a world of pain
[03:39:58] <davetarmac> is there a way to prevent the next function from running?
[03:39:59] <hactor> Cork, it's not an abstraction, it's a tool.
[03:40:03] <Cork> it is
[03:40:06] <hactor> Cork, name one thing that will "break"
[03:40:29] <Cork> hactor: when the typescript generated js isn't what you expected
[03:40:35] <hactor> Cork, like what
[03:40:35] <Cork> and need to debug the generated code
[03:40:44] <Cork> hactor: sigh...
[03:40:48] <hactor> Cork, you don't realize how little TS changes your code.
[03:40:53] <Cork> i hear you haven't ever used something like this before
[03:40:56] <Cork> it always happen
[03:41:13] <davetarmac> I have a button that extends and input field, and I want the input to contract when the input is focusout but clicking on the button does this, but then extends it again
[03:41:27] <hactor> Cork, you evaluate it on conceptual level, which is a big mistake. TypeScript wasn't created by a bunch of amateurs like CoffeeScript.
[03:41:28] <Cork> davetarmac: ajax can't be redirected cross domain as far as i know
[03:41:35] <hactor> Cork, execution mattersn
[03:41:47] <Cork> hactor: no i evaluate it based on what the language brings, and what it costs
[03:41:49] <Woet> hactor: it's made by microsoft, even worse.
[03:41:57] <hactor> Cork, what does it cost, you can't name anything
[03:42:10] <Cork> abstracting the language always makes debugging harder
[03:42:11] <hactor> Just cague threats about terr'ists hidden in my code
[03:42:16] <Cork> this is true for every language
[03:42:17] <hactor> Nothing specific again
[03:42:20] <hactor> Ok.
[03:42:26] <Cork> even asm > c++, go, anything
[03:42:34] <hactor> Cork, just take a step back, and evaluate it some weekend.
[03:42:35] <Cork> at some point things break
[03:42:45] <Cork> and then you have to peal away the abstraction
[03:42:50] <Cork> and things becomes really hard
[03:42:57] <Cork> hactor: been there
[03:43:00] <hactor> Cork, again, this is not some heavy abstraction dude
[03:43:05] <hactor> Cork, it has no runtime
[03:43:10] <hactor> Cork, it has no library
[03:43:11] <Cork> but it is an unneeded abstraction
[03:43:17] <hactor> Cork, it aligns 100% with ES6
[03:43:21] <Cork> no
[03:43:24] <hactor> Cork, productivity is not needed?
[03:43:24] <Cork> again it doesn't
[03:43:31] <Cork> man... read up on your info...
[03:43:49] <Cork> hactor: i've been coding js since the 90's
[03:44:05] <Cork> i can't say variable types has ever been a source of problem for me
[03:44:06] <hactor> Cork, yes, you have this "get off my lawn" attitude, like people who claim syntax coloring makes you stupid
[03:44:13] <Cork> undefined variables; sure
[03:44:20] <Cork> and strict mode fixed that
[03:44:26] <hactor> Cork, it *is* about undefined variables too
[03:44:28] <Cork> hactor: no i don't
[03:44:29] <hactor> Sigh
[03:44:39] <hactor> Ok your loss.
[03:44:39] <Cork> but i'm not "oooh shiny" either
[03:44:45] <hactor> "oh shiny"?
[03:44:53] <hactor> Haha, you have no idea what you're talking about dude.
[03:45:00] <hactor> You keep thinking CoffeeScript
[03:45:02] <Cork> ok, if you please
[03:45:06] <Cork> no i don't
[03:45:09] <hactor> This is saving me HOURS evert day
[03:45:11] <hactor> I value that
[03:45:17] <hactor> You don't value it enough to try it, fine by me.
[03:45:18] <hactor> Your loss.
[03:45:25] <Cork> heh
[03:45:43] <hactor> I have large projects with hundreds of classes.
[03:45:52] <hactor> I won't screw around emulating classes and modules with closures.
[03:46:03] <hactor> I won't type single and double scores to fake protected properties
[03:46:09] <hactor> I'll just focus on what I want to code.
[03:46:24] <hactor> Not much around with ductape and strings faking it
[03:46:35] <Cork> no need to fake it
[03:46:44] <Cork> js don't have classes, it has prototype
[03:46:51] <Cork> you can structure your code with prototype
[03:46:53] <garethdaine> Guys, need some help validating a multi-step form. I’m using fieldsets for the steps and I have an answers array attached to 4 radio buttons on each step, I’d like to validate if a radio button is selected when the user clicks the next button. Here’s my code so far http://laravel.io/bin/Jx3Gj
[03:46:56] <Cork> don't try to emulate another language
[03:46:57] <hactor> Cork, ok ok.
[03:47:00] * hactor pets Cork
[03:47:06] <hactor> Cork, that "other" language is ES6
[03:47:11] <hactor> It's coming anyway, deal with it
[03:47:12] <Cork> that is where things starts to go wrong
[03:47:26] <BrazenBraden> on select change, how can I get the selected value? http://jsfiddle.net/epgyrkwd/
[03:47:27] <Cork> hactor: its just sugar
[03:47:34] <Cork> hactor: js is still not getting classes
[03:47:48] <Cork> it just helps ppl who have to things in classes to write prototype code
[03:47:57] <Cork> *to think in
[03:48:06] <hactor> Cork, so error detection means nothing to you, ok
[03:48:11] <hactor> As I said. You don't value your time.
[03:48:14] <hactor> See ya
[03:48:15] <Cork> lol
[03:48:17] <Woet> hactor: shut up already
[03:48:25] <Cork> you assume alot
[03:48:27] <hactor> Woet, I'm not talking to myself.
[03:48:32] <Woet> we dont need your microsoft advertising here
[03:48:32] <hactor> Cork, so do you
[03:48:35] <Cork> no
[03:48:41] <hactor> Woet, who cares who did it, retard
[03:48:45] <Cork> i don't assume, i base it on evaluation
[03:48:58] <Cork> hactor: don't get abusive
[03:49:00] <Uhkis> Woet: chill out, son
[03:49:04] <Cork> it isn't welcome
[03:49:05] <Woet> Uhkis: pls
[03:49:28] <hactor> Cork, well, fine, our evaluations disagree.
[03:49:44] <Cork> sure, we come from different backgrounds
[03:50:01] <Woet> hactor: you're the one who said "created by a bunch of amateurs like CoffeeScript"
[03:50:07] <Woet> so apparently you're the one who cares who did it
[03:50:15] <Woet> ┐('～`)┌
[03:52:05] <Cork> BrazenBraden: .val() didn't i give you this way back?
[03:52:07] <hactor> Woet, I was talking about this guy, not the company he happens to work for right now: http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Anders_Hejlsberg
[03:52:30] <Cork> BrazenBraden: so http://jsfiddle.net/epgyrkwd/1/
[03:52:42] <hactor> Woet, all his past work is exceptional, and he's among the best in the world to design a language. And TS is a proof he still has it.
[03:52:44] <BrazenBraden> Cork,  you may have given me many things way back.. but thats the problem.. its way back :P
[03:53:14] <Cork> BrazenBraden: way back as in ~ 4h ago
[03:53:32] <BrazenBraden> come again? lol
[03:53:35] <BrazenBraden> Dont recall that
[03:54:39] <Cork> ah ya
[03:54:45] <Cork> it was for Dxchat
[03:54:55] <Cork> exactly the same question though :)
[04:05:02] <BrazenBraden> Cork, solved the ajaxload replacing content issue.. probably not the cleanest solution ever but if you are interested, http://jsfiddle.net/epgyrkwd/2/
[04:05:35] <Cork> ...
[04:05:49] <hactor> Cork, just one example from right this second, and I shut up. I was supposed to write: windowEl.appendTo($('.WindowStack', stackEl)); but I wrote: windowEl.appendTo($('.WindowStack'), stackEl);   TS caught this immediately. How much time you would've spent debugging this? 20 min?
[04:05:50] <Cork> BrazenBraden: that code is broken
[04:06:06] <BrazenBraden> Cork, how so? It works fine.
[04:06:08] <Cork> BrazenBraden: the .append code you wrap AjaxLoad in doesn't do anything
[04:06:25] <Cork> the only thing it does is set this to the dom element
[04:07:10] <BrazenBraden> Cork, true, but does code that does nothing bad (besides the fact that it is a wasted line of space)?
[04:07:30] <Cork> BrazenBraden: it costs quite a bit of cpu
[04:07:43] <Cork> as it need to run all the code for .append that never does anything
[04:07:45] <BrazenBraden> and if i replace it with .html instead
[04:07:55] <Cork> but hay, if you prefer hack and slash; go for it
[04:08:10] <BrazenBraden> always been an rpg fan myself ;P
[04:08:16] <Cork> i could never leave code like that, but its just me
[04:08:40] <garethdaine> Can anyone help me with validating a multi-step form on button click please?
[04:08:41] <BrazenBraden> primary goal, get crap working. secondary goal, make it pretty and efficient
[04:09:10] <Cork> BrazenBraden: its often very hard to do it in that order though
[04:09:21] <Cork> cause the second step often means rewriting everything
[04:09:46] <Cork> so it is best to make things reasonably correct as you start
[04:09:51] <Cork> so you can tweak it later
[04:10:00] <Cork> instead of throwing it all out to get it to be correct
[04:10:08] <garethdaine> I agree with Cork on that one
[04:10:22] <BrazenBraden> Cork, if I didnt have to have this admin user with permissions stuff done by Friday, I would take my time on it. After I have dealt with the next (and pretty much last) task, I will come back to it.
[04:10:51] <BrazenBraden> Cork, this wa just adding new users.. got to make sure the permission divs and embedded ones load up properly when editing a user.
[04:11:09] <BrazenBraden> I have also been told by a friend that I do JS all wrong.. I need to look into JS OOP
[04:11:22] <BrazenBraden> Something I have started reading up on
[04:11:35] <BrazenBraden> Currently I use JS as a functional language
[04:11:50] <Cork> functional is a valid structure
[04:11:58] <Cork> it depends on what the project needs
[04:12:20] <garethdaine> Anyway folks, would really love some help on validating a multi-step form if anyone can offer some advice
[04:12:21] <Cork> as long as you don't get spaghetti code
[04:12:34] <BrazenBraden> Cork, well, the project is rather huge, and because we have done everything functionally, it has resulted in some rediculous function names
[04:13:02] <Erwat> i think your issue rather than it being functional is that you don't use modules (everything is in global scope), right?
[04:13:08] <BrazenBraden> Cork, here is an example:  function operationmod_sale_allocation_handle_asset_cocoon(container)
[04:13:15] <Erwat> so you could technically call any function from anywhere?
[04:13:21] <Erwat> oh, nevermind
[04:13:23] <Cork> BrazenBraden: ok, that is quite horrible
[04:13:30] <BrazenBraden> Cork, yea I know lol
[04:14:13] <Cork> Erwat: ya, that sounds like a good description of the problem
[04:14:25] <Cork> many new languages is quite close to functional actually
[04:14:33] <Cork> go, rust to name two
[04:15:23] <Cork> garethdaine: i don't see any validation code in that paste
[04:15:43] <Cork> garethdaine: also it is quite hard to debug dead code in the head
[04:20:50] <garethdaine> Cork: Yeah, haven’t done any validation code yet mate, that’s what I need help with. I have an answers array on radio buttons in each fieldset in the HTML and I want to check whether a radio button has been selected on .net click before showing the next fieldset
[04:21:28] <Cork> garethdaine: you might want to have a look at the jquery.validation plugin
[04:21:33] <Cork> it is quite popular
[04:21:59] <garethdaine> Yeah, I’m already using that throughout my project, just not sure how to implement validation when not submitting
[04:23:14] <Cork> garethdaine: .valid() on the field
[04:23:17] <Cork> or form
[04:23:57] <garethdaine> Yeah, I’m sort of stuck on how to actually get the field as I’m using an array answers[$id]
[04:23:58] <garethdaine> http://laravel.io/bin/6Lnzr
[04:24:02] <garethdaine> That’s the HTML
[04:24:22] <Cork> garethdaine: simplest is prob to set a class on the active fieldset
[04:24:34] <Cork> and then grab all earlier fieldsets with prevAll
[04:24:42] <Cork> and then select :input from that
[04:27:45] <garethdaine> OK, sounds feasible. I’ll give it a go
[04:27:51] <garethdaine> Thanks Cork
[04:27:55] <Cork> np
[04:43:15] <reuf> can i mix angular with jquery?
[04:45:27] <davetarmac> this is the issue I'm having, you click on the link and it expands the input field, but clicking it again to close it triggers the open script. Is there a way to stop it? http://jsfiddle.net/realchriswells/k88aw7zj/
[04:48:56] <mikecmpbll> davetarmac
[04:49:05] <mikecmpbll> davetarmac: the focusout is happening before the click, i guess
[04:49:14] <mikecmpbll> and the focus out is setting closed = true
[04:50:00] <davetarmac> mikecmpbll: is there a way to fix it so that the click doesn't happen if the focusout has fired?
[04:52:53] <s1m0ne> Hi I use jqueryui autocomplete widget. How can I manually set the focus to a specific element of the result list? "autoFocus: true" focuses the first element automatically. I want to do the same thing but with element x not only element 1.
[04:53:47] <s1m0ne> Basically I am looking for some function myAutocomplete.focusElement(4) or something similar.
[04:55:27] <mikecmpbll> davetarmac: dunno.
[04:58:38] <davetarmac> anyone else know what I cna do to fix that script from firing multiple times? http://jsfiddle.net/realchriswells/k88aw7zj/
[04:59:23] <Cork> davetarmac: what code is firing multiple times?
[05:01:04] <davetarmac> Cork: when you click on the button to extend the input field - that's fine. If you click anywhere other than the button or the input field, that's fine. If you click the button to close the input field, the focusout and the click event trigger - I need just the focusout to trigger
[05:01:31] <davetarmac> actually, the click triggering would be better as that also initiates the search
[05:01:36] <garethdaine> Cork: I’m using var inputs = $('fieldset.active input'); to get all inputs of the active fieldset, how would I now validate if there’s a selected input?
[05:02:06] <davetarmac> TL;DR: so if you click the button to close it, the click even is triggered, not the focusout
[05:03:25] <Cork> garethdaine: why not just bind focus out to the wrapper div?
[05:03:38] <Cork> then you won't get blur from going to the button
[05:03:46] <Cork> sorry focusout
[05:03:51] <garethdaine> Don’t know what you mean Cork
[05:04:03] <Cork> ... wrong nick
[05:04:08] <Cork> davetarmac: ^
[05:04:09] <garethdaine> Ah, thought so
[05:04:39] <Cork> garethdaine: $('fieldset.active
[05:04:40] <Cork> opps
[05:05:05] <Cork> garethdaine: $('fieldset.active').prevAll('fieldset').addBack().find(':input')
[05:05:34] <garethdaine> What is that doing Cork?
[05:06:22] <Cork> garethdaine: find the fieldset.active element
[05:06:34] <Cork> traverse all its previous siblings and grabbing the fieldsets
[05:06:37] <garethdaine> I already have the inputs for the active fieldset using var inputs = $('fieldset.active input');
[05:06:49] <Cork> then adding back it self (the fieldset with the active class)
[05:06:54] <davetarmac> Cork: tried that but it didn't work - unless I didn't understand you correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/realchriswells/k88aw7zj/2/
[05:06:59] <Cork> and then find all the :input fields children of those elements
[05:07:20] <Cork> garethdaine: the one i gave you grabs all current and previous input fields
[05:07:24] <caraconan> Hi there. What's wrong with this panel? (apart from missing assets): http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/r23wLf8u/ I click on "Open/Credits" but nothing happens
[05:07:36] <mikecmpbll> davetarmac: this works, but i dunno how "good" it is! http://jsfiddle.net/k88aw7zj/3/
[05:07:51] <mikecmpbll> tidied up your duplication too.
[05:07:52] <caraconan> OK, let me complete the code, 1 sec
[05:07:56] <Cork> davetarmac: GAH sorry i was thinking of mouseleave...
[05:07:56] <Cork> sorry
[05:08:00] <garethdaine> Cork: No, it only grabs the currently active fieldset inputs, which is fine, I just need to check them to see if one has been selected
[05:08:01] <davetarmac> mikecmpbll: doesn't contract when you click off :)
[05:08:25] <mikecmpbll> ah yes
[05:08:27] <mikecmpbll> woops
[05:08:47] <Cork> garethdaine: ah, so you just want to look in the active fieldset?
[05:09:09] <Cork> garethdaine: $('fieldset.active input:checked').length > 0 should work
[05:09:11] <garethdaine> Yes, exactly Cork. So I have the inpuits in that variable, now I need to check if any have been selected
[05:09:24] <garethdaine> Ah OK, I’ll try that
[05:10:50] <garethdaine> Cork: Easy peasy, works a treat thanks
[05:27:04] <mikecmpbll> davetarmac: eh, just don't trigger the click event if it's visible, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/k88aw7zj/4/
[05:27:52] <hactor> Cork https://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ECMAScript%206%20Status&referringTitle=Roadmap
[05:45:42] <tirengarfio> Im  trying to add a class to an element that at the befining is an string: http://jsfiddle.net/5zxttcjy/1/ but I the class name is not added..
[05:47:18] <Technodrome> what are some good tools to see all event listeners on a page?
[05:55:41] <davetarmac> mikecmpbll: only problem with that fix is that you need to have the option to click the search trigger to initiate a search if there is a value in the input field
[05:55:49] <davetarmac> other than that it works a dream
[05:57:50] <davetarmac> mikecmpb_: ^
[06:20:25] <Nancy2012> hello all.. can you please help me in my conflict that i am having on my jquery code. Actually, i am trying to change the text word of paragrapgh in different color and bold weight.. but it doesnt work when i have more than one paragraphs.. see this code please
[06:20:25] <Nancy2012> http://codepen.io/mel/pen/uAlIn/
[06:21:39] <Woet> Nancy2012: what's wrong with it? it does exactly what you tell it to do
[06:22:10] <Nancy2012> sorry.. my mistake.. but see this code now.. http://jsfiddle.net/6wm6sm73/
[06:22:24] <Cork> Nancy2012: you need this.each(function() { $(this).html() })
[06:22:42] <Cork> else you will replace all of the elements with the sum of all of the elements
[06:23:15] <Cork> this.text() will concat the text from all the paragraphs
[06:23:25] <Cork> and this.html() will append the result to all of them
[06:24:23] <Nancy2012> doesnt seem to work  …  see this now...http://jsfiddle.net/6wm6sm73/1/
[06:24:51] <Cork> Nancy2012: this inside a plugin is jquery
[06:25:17] <Cork> this differs from user exposed calls where this is always a dom element
[06:25:24] <Cork> so you need to wrap this in the inner case
[06:25:31] <Cork> this.each(function() { $(this).html() }) <--
[06:25:44] <Cork> opps sorry you are doing that
[06:25:57] <Cork> Nancy2012: you need to move the var text too
[06:26:25] <Cork> Nancy2012: http://jsfiddle.net/6wm6sm73/2/
[06:27:19] <Cork> Nancy2012: your code should basically always be completely wrapped in an this.each(function() {}); call with you write extensions
[06:27:22] <Cork> *plugins
[06:27:35] <Cork> there is a few exceptions, but in the general case
[06:27:50] <Nancy2012> yes…
[06:28:36] <Nancy2012> you are right.. but i tried in different way  .. .i mean not the different but instead of creating a function.. i just add each on element calling...
[06:28:36] <Nancy2012> http://jsfiddle.net/6wm6sm73/3/
[06:30:05] <Nancy2012> Cork: thanks indeed for your support :)
[06:30:13] <Cork> Nancy2012: ya, that isn't useing a plugin so it should work exactly the same
[06:30:18] <StanAccy> Is it possible to refresh a page (just the <body> ) with jquery rather than using a meta refresh (which causes an awesome page flicker on every update) ?  The server side is sending an entire page - can I retrieve a new page in the background and then just do some jquery manipulation to swap out the old body with the new one?
[06:30:50] <Nancy2012> yes.. :)
[06:31:01] <Cork> StanAccy:not really
[06:31:18] <Cork> StanAccy: you can't refresh the entire body without server support
[06:31:27] <StanAccy> what about a div within the body?
[06:31:32] <Cork> StanAccy: you could add a wrapper element and use the .load hack
[06:31:33] <StanAccy> I can soon wrap the server side output
[06:31:59] <Cork> ya $('body').load(window.location + ' #content')
[06:32:10] <Cork> StanAccy: though i can't really recommend doing it that way
[06:32:23] <Cork> it is better to have the server provide a partial url
[06:32:28] <Cork> where just that content is sent
[06:32:36] <StanAccy> so i cant have some sort of timer that asks for the same page in the bacground via Ajax and then slices and dices that retrieved page, and swaps out the current container div?
[06:32:49] <Cork> jquery has to do a lot of really nasty hacks to wrang out the html from the response
[06:33:02] <StanAccy> Cork: Changing html is easier than changing the server at thsi point, although we're looking at a rest based setup
[06:33:09] <Cork> StanAccy: that is basically what .load does
[06:33:18] <Cork> but it has to parse the docuemnt
[06:33:27] <StanAccy> Cork: I cant say swap(this.#someid, newPage.#someId) ?
[06:33:35] <StanAccy> ah, its the parsing
[06:33:36] <Cork> count on the error correction to rip out the none <body> parts
[06:33:52] <Cork> and then make a selection into the broken blob and jank out that part
[06:33:57] <StanAccy> and until its loaded in to the browser's DOM, its not parsed
[06:33:59] <Cork> then serialize that back to html
[06:34:19] <StanAccy> Hey, I think Ill make a new URL just to serve the DIV...
[06:34:21] <StanAccy> ;-)
[06:34:28] <Cork> so ya, it is much better to have a partial server side that just sends the content of body
[06:34:32] <Cork> without the rest
[06:34:40] <StanAccy> and then just do a simple Ajax timer update on that URL
[06:34:42] <Cork> StanAccy: good choice!
[06:35:15] <StanAccy> Cork: Thanks.
[06:35:20] <Cork> np
[06:36:44] <StanAccy> so the initial page load will contain an empty <div> that the ajax refresh will then load?
[06:37:31] <Cork> StanAccy: just include the partial server side in the initial request
[06:37:51] <Cork> <?php require_once('partial.html'); ?> for a php example
[06:38:08] <Cork> same can be done in all server languages
[06:39:03] <earational> hey
[06:39:36] <jphase> it doesn't support unsupported browser, IE <= 8 are not supported by Microsoft anymore
[06:39:47] <jphase> whooaaa... was scrolled way up.... nothing to see here
[06:39:56] <Cork> lol
[06:40:06] <Cork> what was that in response to?
[06:40:26] <jphase> in response to my lack of coffee and a jQuery 2 question
[06:40:27] <jphase> lol
[06:40:44] <Cork> heh
[06:40:51] <jphase> good morning/afternoon/evening everyone... I'm going to go get more coffee now
[06:40:55] <Cork> the ajax thing?
[06:41:04] <Cork> (or was that yesterday?)
[06:41:57] <jphase> lol, I don't even know - possibly yesterday lol
[06:42:17] <Cork> jphase: the support situation was mentioned
[06:42:20] <Cork> several times
[06:42:46] <jphase> haha, yes yesterday - http://snag.gy/qklT6.jpg
[06:42:53] <jphase> 01:50
[06:44:54] <Cork> ah
[06:44:57] <Cork> interesting
[06:45:06] <Cork> that is a different situation
[06:45:22] <Cork> did anyone answer?
[06:45:42] <jphase> I don't know, clearly that was before I passed out at my keyboard last night so my client signed off right after lol
[06:45:44] * Cork is too lazy to pull up the logs :>
[06:47:41] <Cork> jphase: heh, nope
[06:47:55] <Cork> man i would have loved to answer that one
[06:48:23] <jphase> I can tell lol
[06:48:32] <Cork> only thing after his request until i came on 2.5h later was question after question
[06:48:37] * jphase suggests memoserv - lol
[06:48:42] <Cork> lol
[06:49:04] <jphase> how creepy would that be if we started answering day old questions through memoserv
[06:49:13] <Cork> lol
[06:49:14] <Cork> true
[06:49:17] <Cork> jphase: btw i can recommend znc

[07:02:19] <CaptainJamy> Does anyone know why this jQuery isn't working? I want the page to scroll to the top of content div whenever a pagination is clicked. http://jsfiddle.net/ewnh0djc/
[07:03:16] <dieguezz> hi, how can i exclude a nested selector? for example.. <a href="">Include<span>Exclude</span></a>
[07:03:18] <CaptainJamy> Hmm nevermind. I got it working now.
[07:03:36] <Cork> CaptainJamy: missing jquery? :D
[07:03:57] <CaptainJamy> Yeah lmao.. but yeah It's working in jsfiddle but not in my angularjs app unfortunately
[07:03:57] <Cork> dieguezz: what is the selector
[07:04:30] <dieguezz> i want to get the text inside "a" but not the one inside "span"
[07:04:36] <Cork> dieguezz: basically your question is too generic to answer
[07:04:40] <Cork> ah
[07:04:53] <Cork> dieguezz: you can't really do that
[07:05:08] <P0rk> What is the best way to have a "details" panel slide down when a checkbox is clicked in a form. I've tried about 1000 google results and they all pretty much suck. Any suggestions?
[07:05:11] <Cork> innerText and innerHTML returns children too
[07:05:17] <dieguezz> :(
[07:05:23] <dieguezz> kk.. ill find another way
[07:05:26] <Cork> dieguezz: only option is to clone the element, select all children and remove them
[07:05:27] <dieguezz> ty Cork
[07:05:41] <Cork> dieguezz: best option is most likely to wrap the text in a span
[07:07:05] <doug64k> CaptainJamy: it's a bit wasteful to attach so many separate event handlers
[07:07:41] <doug64k> at least have one on the .pagination click handler, use li selector, and use event.target
[07:08:17] <Cork> or just use delegated
[07:08:38] <Cork> $('.pagination').on('click', 'li', function() {});
[07:08:46] <doug64k> ^
[07:08:55] <CaptainJamy> thanks
[07:10:07] <Erwat> i hope someone pays money to Cork for helping people in this channel

[07:11:24] <Cork> lol
[07:11:38] <Erwat> Cork: if i made significantly more than 500 euros a month working full time then maybe
[07:11:57] <Cork> Erwat: you would have a problem finding a way though ^^'
[07:12:16] <Cork> i do this for my own benefit, and have turned down payment several times
[07:15:35] <doug64k> I agree, time spent working on random problems is great exercise
[07:16:14] <wfq> hi guys
[07:23:40] <reynierpm> hi there, I need some help with this code http://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/1bw3eL17/7/ since the results from the lines 92-109 are not displayed on #ModelBranchManufacturer as should be
[07:25:51] <Absolute0> If I am about to select a bunch of items in a div with $(...). Is it faster to first select the div and then do $(..., div)? Or it makes no difference if I select the items directly $(.item-in-div'
[07:25:56] <Absolute0> )?
[07:26:38] <Cork> Absolute0: that depends on optimizations in the browser
[07:27:00] <Cork> but ya, normally it is better to do $(.., div) or div.find()
[07:27:50] <Absolute0> That's two select calls instead of one.
[07:29:30] <Absolute0> if x is a list of items, what does x.prop('checked') do?
[07:29:50] <Absolute0> http://api.jquery.com/prop/#prop1
[07:29:55] <Absolute0> Description: Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements.
[07:30:27] <Absolute0> how do I do x.prop('checked') such that it would return true if any item in the list is checked?
[07:32:19] <Cork> Absolute0: you would have to loop it
[07:32:30] <Absolute0> or .filter(':checked')
[07:32:31] <Cork> .prop only returns the value of the first element in the list
[07:32:40] <Cork> that would work
[07:32:48] <Cork> or .is(':checked')
[07:33:01] <Absolute0> is ?
[07:33:28] <Absolute0> is is better :D
[07:42:54] <bl4ckdu5t> what's the purpose of "use strict" ?
[07:43:28] <Erwat> bl4ckdu5t: to force potentially bad code to be shown as errors
[07:43:38] <Erwat> so you're more aware of potentially bad areas in your code
[07:44:52] <Absolute0> wc
[07:53:10] <fatmandown> hey guys, i'm using .load() to pull certain divs from external HTML files
[07:53:25] <fatmandown> if those external HTML files contain AJAX calls to an API, will the calls execute after being .load()'ed?
[07:53:55] <NoiseEee> no, why would they fatmandown?
[07:54:05] <fatmandown> new to AJAX scripting
[07:54:25] <NoiseEee> well they're not being executed by a browser, so no.
[07:54:32] <fatmandown> so I'd have to put those api calls in the main document then
[07:54:40] <NoiseEee> i suppose so
[07:54:57] <fatmandown> hmm...shouldn't be a problem, then
[07:54:59] <fatmandown> thanks
[07:55:05] <NoiseEee> np
[07:57:08] <Erwat> html divs can contain ajax calls?

[07:59:48] <DRSK> toFixed breaks when comma is used as delimiter for decimals? => 55,43 etc?
[08:00:04] <aosijdoi> so if i do select.off(); it disables all event listeners but how do i turn them back on? .on() doesn't do the trick
[08:01:06] <DRSK> aosijdoi » tried .trigger?
[08:02:21] <aosijdoi> that's not what i want
[08:02:33] <aosijdoi> basically i have an element that i want to termporarily disbale its event listnerers
[08:02:52] <aosijdoi> i don't know how to turn them back on though
[08:07:33] <DRSK> aosijdoi » got some code?
[08:08:17] <DRSK> I'm thinking there's a change listener somewhere on a select which doesn't function as you might've thought where select.on('change' wont trigger as you'd expect but form.on('change', 'select' would. etc. Hard to say without seeing anything tho.

[08:40:46] <jerry_____> Hello all, I am looking to run a number of $.ajax queries (each data: input is created using entries in an array of unknown length). What is the best way of doing multiple ajax calls and then waiting until they are all done before doing something else?
[08:40:53] <jerry_____> (I am looking to put the results in a table)
[08:46:35] <BillCriswell> jerry_____: Does the order matter?
[08:48:07] <lilsammy> Anyone explain why console.log of a value is outputing it like ["value"] in console?
[08:48:24] <lilsammy> when the key is output as a string, this is an array in a each loop
[08:50:21] <BillCriswell> lilsammy: It looks like key is actually an array.
[08:50:44] <lilsammy> well its the value that has the [""] so you sure you mean the key?
[08:51:09] <BillCriswell> lilsammy: See if you can make a demo at jsbin.com
[08:51:23] <lilsammy> yes its the value ...
[08:51:28] <lilsammy> v[0] is fine omg
[08:51:30] <lilsammy> so stupid
[08:51:43] <LiENUS> aha found my problem
[08:51:51] <LiENUS> is there a built in way in jquery to escape html?
[08:52:56] <jerry_____> Hello Bill, the order of what sorry?
[08:53:10] <jerry_____> At the moment, I have an object which lists all the queries. I am then looking to run them all and save the output.
[08:53:45] <jerry_____> I get the query using objectName.queryValue.toString(); and shoving that in data:
[08:54:46] <shoky> jerry_____: see $.when
[08:54:56] <shoky> `api $.when
[08:54:56] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[08:55:02] <shoky> `api jQuery.when
[08:55:02] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.when(): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred</a> objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[08:55:05] <BillCriswell> jerry_____: The order of the requests. Do you need to do like /1, /2, /3 in order or would /2, /1, /3 be ok.
[08:55:07] <jerry_____> How do I use that for an unknown number of queries though?
[08:55:22] <jerry_____> I would like to do them in order if possible.
[08:55:32] <shoky> $.when.apply($, arrayOfRequests).then(..)
[08:55:34] <BillCriswell> jerry_____: .apply($, [arrayOfQueries])
[08:56:01] <BillCriswell> I'd like to shoky haha
[08:56:20] <robertmaxrees> jerry_____ do they actually need to happen in order? are there cases where some requests rely on others?
[08:56:29] <jerry_____> They don't actually need to happen in order.
[08:56:37] <jerry_____> but it would be preferable.
[08:56:50] <robertmaxrees> errr, why would it be "preferable"?
[08:57:02] <jerry_____> It's to create a table, otherwise when it updates the order would change?
[08:57:15] <shoky> lol, you'd like to shoky?
[08:57:25] <robertmaxrees> oh, include that information in your returned data and order based off that instead.
[08:57:29] <robertmaxrees> don't rely on return order.
[08:57:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: Exactly.
[08:57:46] <BillCriswell> Also listen.
[08:58:25] <shoky> HM
[08:58:56] <jerry_____> I don't know how to get the data from the ajax query? At the moment, I have a function in success that takes the json returned and then appends a div with a new table row and inserts the returned data into that row. I iterate through this process for each query in the javascript object. I really think this is not the right way of doing it though....
[08:59:46] <robertmaxrees> check out the deferred objects syste, - $.when, .then(), etc.
[09:00:03] <NoiseEee> jerry_____: post code
[09:00:20] <jerry_____> Where should I post the code?
[09:00:47] <NoiseEee> yr fave pastebin
[09:01:33] <jerry_____> Give me a few minutes!
[09:01:59] <jerry_____> :)
[09:08:13] <caraconan> Hi there. How can I adjust the height of the <div> containing the google map to the height of the page? Thanks http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/muh1mxcm/
[09:11:49] <Zzaichik> will $(window).height() not work?
[09:12:21] <Zzaichik> You can even subtract the height of the footer and header from it.
[09:14:58] <wa5ted> Zzaichik:  what?
[09:14:59] <catcher> Is regex my best bet for reliably replacing the last segment in a url string?
[09:15:02] <jerry_____> Hello, here is the code that I am struggling with http://jsfiddle.net/Ilmv/6SU89/
[09:15:14] <wa5ted> catcher: yes
[09:15:25] <jerry_____> It's probably not quite complete, but it shows the methods that I am looking to do.
[09:15:28] <wa5ted> unless you know the length of the "last segment of the url"
[09:15:36] <wa5ted> then you get the substring form the last '/'
[09:15:37] <jerry_____> Run every query in that object and then post the result into the table.
[09:15:45] <wa5ted> and then remove the remaining part
[09:15:47] <catcher> wa5ted, I do, but I don't trust it to remain the same. Regex it is.
[09:15:52] <catcher> wa5ted, have any handy? :)
[09:15:59] <robertmaxrees> catcher what do you mean "last segment of a url string"?
[09:16:04] <wa5ted> catcher: are you deleteing something after a slash?
[09:16:28] <catcher> wa5ted, yes, and replacing it with something else.  Basic ajax id stuff.
[09:16:38] <wa5ted> then do a substring
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> catcher can you give an example of what you're working against?
[09:17:17] <catcher> robertmaxrees, domain/photos/view/1,  domain/photos/2014/view/201
[09:17:30] <catcher> The 2nd example shows an important case where '201' could be duplicated
[09:17:47] <robertmaxrees> you can do string.split('/'), then get the last item in that array.
[09:18:26] <catcher> robertmaxrees, & reconstruct the array with elements = array length - 1
[09:18:45] <robertmaxrees> tons of different ways at that point.
[09:19:16] <catcher> Yeah, just looking for a wheel that's already been invented before I write it.
[09:19:40] <catcher> Seems like it'd be a common thing, but I didn't see any reliable examples.
[09:20:28] <robertmaxrees> it's one of those things that's so simple, you can normally just do it yourself.
[09:21:31] <jerry_____> @NoiseEee - Here is the link to the code: http://jsfiddle.net/Ilmv/6SU89/
[09:22:19] <NoiseEee> jerry_____: right, but maybe some code describing what you're trying to do with that returned data?
[09:24:01] <jerry_____> @NoiseEee - I am just looking to put it in a table. There are only certain values from the returned Json that I am interested in.
[09:24:14] <jerry_____> If that's what you mean
[09:25:48] <NoiseEee> jerry_____: so what exactly is your question? it seems like you able to retreive data you are interested in already, no?
[09:26:33] <jerry_____> I have a couple of issues, I would like to close off that table, but if I include it in the success function, then it will run every time.
[09:26:46] <jerry_____> So I need to wait until all the calls have been made before I close off the table.
[09:27:08] <NoiseEee> jerry_____: if thats the approach you want to take, you can look into jquery promises... basically saying 'when all this is done, do this'
[09:27:37] <NoiseEee> so after each call, you could put the data you want into an object, then when its all completed, render the data from that object in some way
[09:27:54] <jerry_____> I'm not sure where to place them given that my ajax query is already within a loop. Thanks for your help by the way.
[09:28:16] <robertmaxrees> joops are the wrong way to handle that btw.
[09:28:33] <robertmaxrees> the queries can complete at different times, regardless of when they were fired off.
[09:28:38] <robertmaxrees> that's why promises are so nice.
[09:28:54] <robertmaxrees> *loops hahahaha
[09:28:56] <jerry_____> @robertmaxrees - I suspected as much :\ what is the correct way?
[09:28:59] <duckxx> hi everyone new to this...
[09:29:09] <NoiseEee> you just need to rewrite them a little bit. see http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises--net-24135 or google about 'jquery promises'
[09:29:15] <robertmaxrees> the deferreds/promises everybody has been telling you about.
[09:29:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:29:23] <jerry_____> How do I deal with promises when the number of ajax queries is unknown?
[09:30:07] <jerry_____> @NoiseEee thanks for the link
[09:30:14] <NoiseEee> np good luck!
[09:30:49] <duckxx> does anyone know how you can add a fade in or duration to blurring background elements? I'm using foggy.js and this is the issue: https://github.com/nbartlomiej/foggy/issues/11
[09:33:47] <dmsuperman> I'm having a brain fart. I have an <ol> with <li>s inside. Each <li> can have another <ol> nested, and it can be nested infinitely deep. Given an $li node, I want to find all of the :inputs in that node that aren't inside any of the nested children
[09:33:51] <dmsuperman> what selector am I looking for?
[09:34:53] <robertmaxrees> you want direct children?
[09:34:54] <robertmaxrees> > iirc
[09:35:03] <dmsuperman> I'm not sure if they're direct though, that's the issue
[09:35:10] <dmsuperman> could be wrapped in a div or anything else
[09:35:16] <dmsuperman> but I don't want any children inside of an <ol>
[09:35:33] <dmsuperman> so basically I want to exclude a specific child from the selector
[09:38:08] <dmsuperman> I guess I could just rework it so the <ol> is always outside of a <div> with a given class so I can filter that way
[09:38:13] <dmsuperman> But I didn't want to :D
[09:38:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to - i'd look at filtering and stuff.
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm in the middle of a small fire at work otherwise i'd kick around ideas :)
[09:39:07] <BillCriswell> duckxx: Ick. That doesn't animate sexy like at all.
[09:39:12] <dmsuperman> no worries, thanks anyway, I'll keep digging :)
[09:39:18] <BillCriswell> Oh, after the first time it's not so bad.
[09:39:32] <dmsuperman> maybe I can use .children().not()
[09:40:08] <duckxx> o so blurring animation doesn't look good?
[09:40:19] <duckxx> i thought it might cuz right now it just pops into the screen as blurred
[09:40:21] <BillCriswell> duckxx: It didn't look good on the first hover to me.
[09:40:28] <duckxx> when u click a  button to show a modal window
[09:40:52] <duckxx> im using it when u have an modal window pop out and everything in the background goes blurry
[09:41:45] <t0astt> Can someone explain to me why my link within a table is still working even though I am using preventDefault()? http://pastebin.com/8DGHq8Dh
[09:42:45] <dmsuperman> oh and Im using this selector for event delegation, makes it even harder ;P
[09:44:17] <guyz> {Q} how can i use something like: var myVariable = 'left'; $("#whatever").animate({myVariable:"0px"});
[09:44:27] <guyz> it doesn't work when i put the var in it
[09:44:30] <t0astt> Nevermind, I had some weird syntax going on in another part of my script that was causing it to fail.
[09:46:24] <NoiseEee> guyz: you cant really, sorry
[09:47:24] <dmsuperman> var myVar = "left"; var options = {}; options[myVar] = "0px"; $whatever.animate(options);
[09:47:29] <NoiseEee> guyz: you could do a workaround but itd be more work. var myVariable = 'left';   var animateObj = {};  animateObj[myVariable] = "0px";
[09:47:37] <BinaryKitten> guyz: myAnimation = {}; myAnimation[$myvar] = '0px'; ...
[09:47:38] <NoiseEee> haha like dmsuperman says,  but what are you gaining?
[09:48:12] <BinaryKitten> heh. 3x the people telling you how.. that's worth the money you've paid to get the answer
[09:48:54] <guyz> well i'm trying to change the direction of a slide effect based on your previous selection without having to duplicate code in an if/else statement
[09:49:12] <guyz> but i'll see what i can make of it
[09:49:43] <dmsuperman> if/else is more explicit, and I generally prefer explicit code
[09:49:55] <dmsuperman> but it's not the end of the world
[09:50:52] <BillCriswell> duckxx: http://jsbin.com/doxapajihi/2/edit?css,js,output ?
[09:51:30] <duckxx> wow
[09:51:33] <duckxx> tats awesome
[09:52:03] <duckxx> o wait
[09:52:05] <duckxx> tats just css
[09:52:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah, a cross browser solution would be more js heavy.
[09:52:33] <duckxx> i see
[09:52:44] <duckxx> yea i think thats why i used foggy.js
[09:52:47] <jerry_____> For a variable to be seen by all functions, it has to be global doesn't it? Can each function then edit it?
[09:52:47] <BillCriswell> Lots of cloning elements and animating their position/opacity slightly
[09:52:51] <dmsuperman> I'm dumb robertmaxrees I just needed to pick the parent properly in my event handler, no need for some big confusing selector
[09:52:53] <duckxx> but thanks for leading me in the right direction
[09:53:00] <dmsuperman> it came to me as I was writing a fiddle ;)
[09:53:05] <duckxx> totally forgot about the transition timing in css
[09:53:37] <BillCriswell> duckxx: This effect is subtle enough that I think less capable browsers can just get a background with transparency behind the overlay.
[09:54:06] <duckxx> yea
[09:57:57] <BillCriswell> duckxx: Just think about all the work that needs to be done for that fallback. Ugh.
[09:57:59] <dmsuperman> Will find always return the closest descendents first?
[09:58:14] <dmsuperman> Meaning if I want to find the top-most <tr> inside a <table> can I do table.find('tr').first() ?
[09:58:21] <dmsuperman> even if there are nested tables
[09:58:26] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: yup.
[09:58:38] <dmsuperman> sweet

[10:15:25] <robertmaxrees> it's more about knowing your various options and picking the right one for the current job.
[10:16:58] <respek> I see. Thanks for the fix. I'd really like to get through this valley of awkward in terms of literacy, can you recommend a method to expose myself to various techniques? Kind of like a musician's etude http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude
[10:17:07] <respek> hi verumequals
[10:46:37] <th3fallen> Hey guys, anyone a deferred master in here?
[10:47:12] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ th3fallen
[10:47:12] <b-ot> th3fallen: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:48:29] <th3fallen> fair enough, https://gist.github.com/th3fallen/5bd7a89463c3eff7b63a got this code on line 74 im attempting to call the .done callback in my ajax method, i have no idea how. Any ideas/
[10:49:18] <th3fallen> This is uncharted territory for me so im at a loss
[11:01:53] <codecutter> load external resources in jsfiddle seems not be opening, anyone else eperiancing this?
[11:02:12] <th3fallen> Guess not, back to digging
[11:09:46] <intothev01d> are you sure you wouldn't wan't to just resolve the promise?
[11:10:38] <intothev01d> jqXHR.resolve(value);
[11:10:49] <intothev01d> th3fallen, ^
[11:11:29] <th3fallen> I'll try that thanks intothev01d
[11:12:05] <intothev01d> basically you wan't your ajax.done to be called if it's in the cache and not actually make the request, correct?
[11:12:19] <intothev01d> or resolve your promise there
[11:16:00] <th3fallen> Yes exacltly
[11:16:03] <th3fallen> intothev01d
[11:16:17] <th3fallen> i want it to just return the value and no make the request
[11:16:43] <intothev01d> did resolving the jqXHR work then?
[11:16:50] <th3fallen> Trying now
[11:18:48] <th3fallen> I get undefined is not a function on jqXHR.resolve
[11:19:40] <intothev01d> hmm, yea ok. it implements Promise but not Deferred
[11:20:20] <th3fallen> If you say so.... Lol
[11:21:34] <scottbuckel> I have a radio button selected, I can confirm by changing any of its attributes EXCEPT selected.....attr('checked',true) will NOT select it...hmm?
[11:22:19] <robertmaxrees> you want .prop()
[11:23:14] <scottbuckel> .prop('checked',true)? I'll give it a try..
[11:24:04] <th3fallen> scottbuckel yes that should work
[11:24:25] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you rarely want .attr() for attributes.
[11:24:33] <robertmaxrees> .prop() is generally what you actually want.
[11:25:01] <scottbuckel> robertmaxrees, th3fallen no luck...what could I be missing here?
[11:25:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?  select a radio?
[11:25:25] <th3fallen> Wait, you're trying to verify it's checked?
[11:25:28] <th3fallen> Or make it checked?
[11:25:31] <th3fallen> scottbuckel
[11:25:32] <scottbuckel> No, I'm trying to make it selected
[11:26:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ayv2wuvw/
[11:26:10] <robertmaxrees> pretty straightforward.
[11:26:18] <robertmaxrees> check your console for errors maybe?
[11:26:34] <th3fallen> Yeah that prop method is what you want maybe you're not selecting the right element?
[11:26:58] <scottbuckel> hahahahah, very straightforward...hmm I'm doing an $(this).parent().filter('input:radio').prop('checked',true);
[11:27:06] <scottbuckel> no errors at all..
[11:27:19] <robertmaxrees> that means your traversal is bad.
[11:27:31] <robertmaxrees> could you create a fiddle with your html and js?
[11:27:33] <scottbuckel> but i can hide/show it or change the background color, etc and it works...
[11:27:34] <intothev01d> th3fallen, do you have a .fail handler on your ajax call?
[11:27:45] <th3fallen> intothev01d i dont
[11:27:46] <scottbuckel> it's mangled in a bunch of other code, but I can try..
[11:27:59] <matthardesty> is there anone that'
[11:28:04] <intothev01d> hmm, but it seems you could call jqXHR.abort(), which would trigger that.
[11:28:13] <matthardesty> is there anyone that's willing to give me a hand with a form submission issue?
[11:28:14] <intothev01d> so it would not actually make the request
[11:28:18] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ matthardesty
[11:28:18] <b-ot> matthardesty: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:28:33] <intothev01d> doh, you're already using that
[11:28:36] <matthardesty> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:28:37] <th3fallen> I already am calling jqXHR.abort on line 79
[11:28:41] <th3fallen> heh
[11:28:47] <intothev01d> right, but you only have a .done handler on the actual call?
[11:28:48] <th3fallen> Let me try adding a fail and see if it works
[11:29:56] <matthardesty> I have an issue that I believe is caused by jquery. I have a form on a page and, while it will return validation errors, it won't actually submit. I do not have any console errors.
[11:30:24] <th3fallen> Yes fail runs intothev01d
[11:30:36] <intothev01d> ok good
[11:30:51] <matthardesty> let me rephrase. validation is working. however, when validation passes, the form still won't submit
[11:31:10] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ matthardesty
[11:31:10] <b-ot> matthardesty: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:31:23] <th3fallen> If you say so intothev01d  lol
[11:33:12] <matthardesty> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/775fx6xh/
[11:33:59] <intothev01d> so in the fail, the first argument is the jqXHR
[11:34:22] <th3fallen> Yes
[11:34:29] <th3fallen> I can already log out the jqHXR
[11:34:34] <intothev01d> in the fail right?
[11:34:48] <th3fallen> Im sure i could but im logging it before i call abort
[11:35:34] <intothev01d> so, jqXHR.value = JSON.parse(value); jqXHR.abort();
[11:35:51] <intothev01d> then in you fail you have access to jqXHR.value
[11:35:55] <intothev01d> your*
[11:35:59] <th3fallen> But thats not going to call my done method?
[11:36:26] <intothev01d> no, it's going to the fail method
[11:36:54] <th3fallen> Wow im stupid....
[11:37:03] <th3fallen> I can just do return jqXHR.done(value);
[11:37:11] <intothev01d> sweet
[11:37:14] <intothev01d> that works too
[11:37:18] <th3fallen> Doh
[11:37:19] <th3fallen> Lol
[11:37:32] <th3fallen> Thanks a ton for the help intothev01d
[11:37:36] <intothev01d> np
[11:37:48] <intothev01d> didn't help much b/c you found a better solution but hey, whatever works :)
[11:37:59] <codecutter> how would you guys share a local file inside jsfiddle?
[11:38:30] <codecutter> i have a json file that I am trying to se inside jffiddle
[11:38:55] <th3fallen> Sometimes you just got to talk through it to find the solution, intothev01d
[11:39:05] <intothev01d> yep
[11:39:10] <intothev01d> rubber duck debugging
[11:39:11] <matthardesty> codecutter, I came across an article that mentioned you could host the json file on dropbox and replace the www with dl
[11:39:21] <matthardesty> codecutter, then, you can reference using that link
[11:39:22] <th3fallen> I was just about to say thanks for being a rubber ducky lol
[11:39:28] <intothev01d> lol np
[11:42:39] <codecutter> <matthardesty>: how would you then reference the data file with a js variable?
[11:43:35] <matthardesty> codecutter, i'm a total code noob and I'm not sure
[11:44:00] <codecutter> :)
[11:44:45] <Baako> Hi guys i have a form http://pastebin.com/knG6BPjC which i want to automatically submit when the input length is > or = to 32
[11:45:05] <Baako> i have try this http://pastebin.com/LEarSueE  but it doesnt seem to do what i want it to do
[11:45:37] <Baako> i am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[11:48:10] <BillCriswell> Baako: What kind of element is #text?
[11:48:16] <t0astt> Can anyone recommend a simple, decent-looking alert plugin?
[11:49:09] <Baako> BillCriswell it is an input field
[11:50:02] <codecutter> I have a json file that i added to jsfiddle via external resources, how would place its contents into a js variable?
[11:50:22] <codecutter> would i*
[11:50:42] <BillCriswell> Baako: and it has id="text" on it?
[11:51:04] <Baako> BillCriswell yes
[11:51:20] <oleole> I have a canvas that I can zoom and pan with the panzoom plugin. When the user clicks on the canvas, I would like the coordinates they clicked on, and it works fine when you have not zoomed in and out. Try my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hugef0c7/ . If you click the upper left corner, it’ll output something close to 10,10 (X,Y), drag the canvas around (without zooming) and click the upper left corner again; again it will show something close to 10
[11:51:20] <oleole> because I can easily track where you click as long as you haven’t zoomed in. But how do I get the relative coordinates when you have zoomed in? The only number I can get is how much it’s zoomed (the first element in the matrix array - so if you’ve zoomed in twice, it would be 2, if you have not zoomed in, it would be 1 etc.). Any ideas?
[11:51:37] <reynierpm> BillCriswell I need some help with some code
[11:51:38] <BillCriswell> Baako: You'll need to prove it with a demo. =)
[11:51:44] <BillCriswell> Baako: jsbin.com
[11:52:35] <reynierpm> BillCriswell I posted here on Stackoverflow since I pass all the nigth trying to get it working and did not here is the link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26636461/create-non-repeated-pairs-between-results-and-manufactures-why-results-are-not can you take a look?
[11:54:04] <Baako> BillCriswell how do i save it so i can give u the link?
[11:54:33] <BillCriswell> Click "Share" at the top.
[11:54:54] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: This is too wordy of a question. You should really make the question a lot simpler to ask.
[11:55:27] <Baako> BillCriswell http://jsbin.com/xotocodola/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[11:56:37] <reynierpm> BillCriswell yes, I know, but then comes people to say I do not understand what you´re looking for and so on for that reason and because Stackoverflow is a jelous on this I do the best try to explain my problem
[11:58:26] <BillCriswell> Baako: http://jsbin.com/pufokucoli/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:58:51] <th3fallen> well crap now its duplicating requests when it does need to make them argh
[11:59:32] <BillCriswell> Baako: Are you waiting for the length of the input to be at least 32 characters long then submit automatically?
[12:00:04] <Baako> Yes BillCriswell
[12:01:08] <BillCriswell> Baako: http://jsbin.com/pufokucoli/2/edit?js,output
[12:03:07] <Baako> BillCriswell thank you so much
[12:03:15] <BillCriswell> Baako: No problem.
[12:03:48] <Baako> the input field will be a code which is sent to another page to check against the database
[12:04:01] <BillCriswell> Baako: Sweet.
[12:42:57] <pixelpr0> hi guys
[12:44:30] <pixelpr0> Maybe someone could help me. Im trying to create a countdown on my website and im using this: http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown/ ---- the problem is, the countdown isnt working - maybe because im using it on a forum. In a standalone its working...
[12:44:32] <pixelpr0> http://www.death-or-glory.de/page/raidplaner.html
[12:44:56] <pixelpr0> thats the website. if you take a look at the sourcecode there is a div #clock
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> can't access that page.
[12:50:49] * CssNoob good morning and goodnight y'all
[12:52:22] <pixelpr0> ah wait
[12:52:23] <pixelpr0> my bad
[12:53:08] <pixelpr0> now you can... the funny thing is, after i set an alert() its going really weird
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> don't use alerts.
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[12:53:22] <pixelpr0> ok
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> actually don't do either right now.
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> making it hard to troubleshoot the issue.
[12:54:53] <pixelpr0> so console.log is working
[12:54:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:54:57] <pixelpr0> but it isnt updating the div
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> could you delete that bit?
[12:55:33] <pixelpr0> i did
[12:55:58] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  something seems off here.
[12:59:45] <pixelpr0> hm?
[13:01:27] <robertmaxrees> can you show the isolated example you have?
[13:02:37] <totesjakey> Hey robertmaxrees? I know this might be offtopic, but do you have any suggestions in terms of learning resources for HTML/DOM organization guidelines?
[13:03:17] <dmsuperman> totesjakey: like what?
[13:03:28] <dmsuperman> stuff like that generally comes with experience
[13:03:31] <dmsuperman> unless you have a specific question
[13:03:44] <dmsuperman> one cannot know which ways are more of a pain in the ass until they have to deal with the pain in the ass they created
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a really generic question.
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> and it's all situational.
[13:04:08] <totesjakey> just a manual or a guide on things like, when to use flexbox, what should be nested inside of what, how to generalize your nesting habits so that css is still targeted yet readable
[13:04:12] <robertmaxrees> get familiar with MDN for everything.  lean about block vs. inline, etc.
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> if you're supporting old IE, you can't do flexbox.
[13:04:43] <totesjakey> IE is dead to me, momma told me in first grade that I can't please everyone and I took it to heart
[13:05:49] <pixelpr0> http://jsfiddle.net/0g244675/2/
[13:07:11] <totesjakey> so strong > b, em > i
[13:07:52] <dmsuperman> totesjakey: practice is really the only way. Especially since your particular use case will be the primary influence for what is better than what
[13:08:49] <totesjakey> Gotcha. I was just going crazy with http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp and I was wondering if people were doing the same thing or just sticking to divs with classes
[13:10:28] <dmsuperman> I think people tend to overblow the importance there. if you can make your website degrade gracefully (assuming you have a need for that), go for it, but I wouldn't let it really influence things on that large of a scale
[13:10:40] <pixelpr0> robert isnt that weird?
[13:10:50] <dmsuperman> Sometimes I write web apps that don't work without JS even D:
[13:11:21] <dmsuperman> I do tend to use <header> and <footer> just because it's more universal than trying to decide on a specific class to use
[13:11:46] <dmsuperman> But for a singular application I don't think it matters between <header> and <div class="header">
[13:12:02] <dmsuperman> but I work on a system that devs use to write hundreds of websites with so that's where it helps
[13:12:02] <totesjakey> but I still have to choose one :(
[13:12:12] <dmsuperman> arbitrary, just go with whatevery ou like
[13:12:15] <dmsuperman> don't spend time on it :)
[13:12:39] <totesjakey> but I dont know what I like
[13:12:41] <totesjakey> oh god
[13:12:45] <dmsuperman> flip a coin
[13:13:03] <dmsuperman> <header> takes slightly fewer bytes
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 sorry handling some other stuff.  somebody else might be able to hgelp you.
[13:14:23] <pixelpr0> ok
[13:14:31] <dmsuperman> I don't see a timer pixelpr0
[13:14:39] <pixelpr0> someone maybe got 2-3 minutes to help me?
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question, pixelpr0
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask - just put it out there ;)
[13:15:09] <pixelpr0> @dmsuperman when im using the console.log it kinda spams the console
[13:15:24] <dmsuperman> what is the problem?
[13:15:42] <pixelpr0> console.log outputs the countdown but the div isnt updating
[13:15:53] <dmsuperman> I don't see any countdown in a console
[13:16:05] <pixelpr0> wait i // it
[13:16:19] <dmsuperman> I don't see a div with an ID of clock either
[13:16:26] <pixelpr0> ok refresh it
[13:16:33] <pixelpr0> the div got the id="clock"
[13:17:29] <dmsuperman> $('#clock').length is 0 for me
[13:17:53] <pixelpr0> y but as you see console.log works
[13:17:57] <dmsuperman> ok
[13:17:59] <dmsuperman> so what is the question?
[13:18:08] <dmsuperman> it appears to be working correctly
[13:18:15] <dmsuperman> you just don't have the right selector to update
[13:18:23] <dmsuperman> there is no node with id=clock
[13:18:35] <pixelpr0> the question or problem is, that #clock should update (countdown) and as you see the console.log() works with the output
[13:18:55] <dmsuperman> the answer, again, is there is no #clock
[13:19:00] <pixelpr0> div#clock
[13:19:05] <dmsuperman> no such thing
[13:19:32] <pixelpr0> 2 lines above the script
[13:19:49] <dmsuperman> something is removing it from the DOM then
[13:20:00] <dmsuperman> because if you check $('#clock').length after the page loads it's 0
[13:20:20] <dmsuperman> oh, lol, you have something else for $ that isn't jquery
[13:20:25] <dmsuperman> sorry
[13:20:56] <pixelpr0> lol?
[13:21:18] <dmsuperman> laugh out loud
[13:21:25] <dmsuperman> your $ was confusing the issue for me
[13:21:37] <dmsuperman> can you comment out the console.log line?
[13:21:45] <pixelpr0> sure
[13:21:47] <dmsuperman> Clearly the clock jquery plugin is emitting the events correctly
[13:21:56] <pixelpr0> i did
[13:22:23] <dmsuperman> div#clock is pointless btw just use #clock
[13:22:40] <dmsuperman> an ID is already unique
[13:23:09] <pixelpr0> ok
[13:23:13] <dmsuperman> actually can you uncomment that entire script block?
[13:23:17] <dmsuperman> comment*
[13:23:23] <dmsuperman> I'll try entering it by hand so I can inspect what's happening
[13:23:50] <pixelpr0> sure
[13:24:01] <dmsuperman> thanks
[13:24:02] <pixelpr0> did
[13:29:50] <dmsuperman> no clue honestly, something else must be conflicting
[13:30:18] <dmsuperman> it makes no sense that updating the HTML of a node within the event handler would behave differently than updating outside the event handler
[13:30:24] <dmsuperman> even jQuery("#clock").countdown("2014/10/30").on("update.countdown", function(event) { jQuery("#clock").html('my tacos are good'); });  doesn't work for me
[13:30:43] <dmsuperman> but jQuery("#clock").html('asdfasdfasdf'); does
[13:32:25] <pixelpr0> would it make sense to save the value in a variable and outside the function set it?
[13:32:51] <totesjakey> globals are generally bad.. callbacks, callbacks are good.
[13:32:56] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple versions of jquery on the page?
[13:32:56] <totesjakey> ro promises
[13:32:57] <dmsuperman> no, there's definitely something else amuck here
[13:33:04] <dmsuperman> you gotta find what it is and fix that
[13:33:21] <dmsuperman> he might robertmaxrees but it's really weird, I even tried this.innerHTML = 'asdf';
[13:33:24] <dmsuperman> no dice
[13:33:33] <dmsuperman> and tcJq which is his jQuery.noConflict()
[13:33:50] <dmsuperman> console.log(this); shows that it is indeed the node in question
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> then something really funky is going on.
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> and the site is fundamentally broken.
[13:34:05] <dmsuperman> maybe that plugin clears the innerHTML or something
[13:34:11] <dmsuperman> but it works in the example...
[13:35:13] <sergey> Hi. Please help me get work jquery validation http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/qexdc55w/ It works fine for button "Invest" but for rest it works partially.
[13:35:55] <dmsuperman> yeah, there's something else fighting your code for sure, or it's the plugin itself
[13:36:01] <pixelpr0> so it seems my jquery is broken everywhere
[13:36:04] <dmsuperman> I just made a <div id="someothernode"></div> on your page
[13:36:10] <dmsuperman> and I modify that node within the event handler
[13:36:11] <dmsuperman> that works fine
[13:36:21] <dmsuperman> so something is clearing the node's innerHTML right after you set it
[13:36:31] <pixelpr0> but im not really able to edit some IPB-jquery files
[13:37:26] <dmsuperman> I doubt it's anything in your IPB
[13:37:37] <pixelpr0> so any tips how i should start? im not really good with jquery
[13:37:38] <dmsuperman> I suspect it's the plugin or you have your code duplicated somewhere else or something like that
[13:37:43] <pixelpr0> just small things like this...
[13:38:16] <dmsuperman> put this stupid snippet in there: jQuery('<div>').css({border: '1px solid black', background: 'white', height: '100px'}).attr('id', 'myshit').appendTo(document.body); jQuery("#clock").countdown("2014/10/30").on("update.countdown", function(event) { jQuery("#myshit").html(event.strftime('%D days %H:%M:%S')); });
[13:38:35] <dmsuperman> as long as you modify any other node beside #clock within the event handler it works
[13:38:43] <dmsuperman> (scroll to bottom of page to see the new clock with this snippet)
[13:39:05] <totesjakey> Ok so when you create an element, $("<div>") == $("<div/>") ?
[13:39:16] <dmsuperman> yeah
[13:40:26] <callidapiaellee> Hi
[13:40:26] <pixelpr0> so you fixxed it?
[13:41:06] <dmsuperman> ?
[13:41:43] <pixelpr0> im a bit confused now
[13:41:45] <totesjakey> http://jsperf.com/jquery-create-element123123
[13:41:55] <dmsuperman> copy the snippet I just gave you and run it in your console
[13:41:59] <dmsuperman> then scroll to the very bottom of the page
[13:42:01] <dmsuperman> there's a timer there
[13:42:07] <pixelpr0> ok
[13:42:18] <dmsuperman> as long as the node with the timer html in it isn't the same node that you attach the countdown plugin to, it appears to work
[13:42:28] <dmsuperman> so something else is fighting with your code to change the countdown node's innerHTML
[13:42:49] <dmsuperman> so you'll have to figure out what's fighting with it ;)
[13:42:50] <pixelpr0> ok... weird shit anyway
[13:45:32] <numproc> can you tell me what is the best way of filtering data, something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/n17u4vgo/embedded/result/
[13:45:34] <totesjakey> no you know what's weird? this site http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/acm/index.html and im in charge of brigning it into the current decade
[13:45:41] <dmsuperman> totesjakey: yeah, the built-in DOM tools are generally faster than the jquery ones
[13:45:44] <dmsuperman> but less featureful
[13:46:00] <dmsuperman> numproc: you're gonna need to provide more details
[13:46:04] <totesjakey> but the results of those functions are exactly the same
[13:46:21] <dmsuperman> but the way they arrive at those results is different
[13:46:28] <dmsuperman> the jquery one has the overhead of first parsing your statement
[13:46:34] <numproc> i have a file in server wich is generated mysql "backend" with name cache_shop_home.html
[13:46:50] <numproc> and in that file cache_shop_home.html i have conttent like i privide in that URL
[13:47:05] <dmsuperman> it has to detect that you want $() to fire document.createElement rather than document.getElementById or document.querySelector or whatever else
[13:47:12] <numproc> now i need to make request in that file on load, and filter that data then append in DOM
[13:47:13] <dmsuperman> since they all run through the same method
[13:47:13] <totesjakey> but the intentions are always the same
[13:47:41] <dmsuperman> numproc: $.ajax to request the file
[13:47:46] <totesjakey> i hear what you're saying im just being a pain
[13:48:00] * dmsuperman stabs totesjakey 
[13:48:02] <numproc> dmsuperman: how can i filter then data how i want
[13:48:25] <numproc> for example to remove all @@@@^0 and some chars
[13:48:36] <dmsuperman> if you want to remove specific characters, you can use regex
[13:48:43] <dmsuperman> it depends on how that data is structured
[13:48:55] <dmsuperman> which isn't something I can tell you since it's your data ;)
[13:48:57] <callidapiaellee> i
[13:49:07] <numproc> yea i understand
[13:49:10] <numproc> thanks
[13:49:40] <callidapiaellee> i'm having an issue with sizing an element with percentages that seems to be due to .load()
[13:50:17] <callidapiaellee> using width: 100% draws nothing, but width: 100px does
[13:50:26] <dmsuperman> code
[13:50:27] <dmsuperman> ?
[13:50:34] <robertmaxrees> has nothing to do with load and everything to do with the containing element ;)
[13:56:37] <sergey> Hi. Please help me get work jquery validation http://jsfiddle.net/Graff/qexdc55w/ It works fine for button "Invest" but for rest it works partially.
[13:57:45] <dmsuperman> "it works partially" meaning what?
[13:58:29] <sergey> dmsuperman: validator shows error messages in wrong place
[13:59:34] <dmsuperman> "wrong place" meaning what?
[14:00:17] <sergey> there 3 almost same forms, and if I move donation dialog instead of investment dialog to first place donation works fine and investment no
[14:00:39] <sergey> I think problem with duplicated input names
[14:02:19] <sergey> dmsuperman: press "invest" button, then press another invest button in dialog
[14:02:55] <sergey> this will show correct result
[14:03:30] <sergey> if you press "Donate" button, then press another Donate button in dialog it will show wrong result
[14:19:58] <jeffmjack>  on the 'submit' event, how do you go about selecting the parent <form> to the <input> element?
[14:20:55] <sergey> var scope = $(this).parent().parent(); if ($(scope).find('form').valid()){}
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean in $('form').on('submit', function() {}); ?
[14:21:03] <robertmaxrees> because $(this) would be the form.
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> .closest('form') would be your best bet for finding the parent that matches a given selector.
[14:21:39] <sergey> submit button is outside form
[14:22:34] <jeffmjack> oh ok
[14:22:44] <jeffmjack> for some reason I thought this would be the event itself
[14:22:54] <jeffmjack> * 'this'
[14:23:00] <sergey> What can you suggest? I want t use same JS code for 3 modal which are almost same
[14:26:09] <jeffmjack> hmmm ok I must be doing something wrong
[14:26:10] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/y81ssrh8/
[14:26:31] <robertmaxrees> err...
[14:26:40] <dmsuperman> jeffmjack: no, event (or whatever you specifyed as the argument name for the callback) is the event
[14:26:42] <robertmaxrees> $(this), not $('this')
[14:27:07] <dmsuperman> this is the form
[14:27:42] <sergey> validation done by http://jqueryvalidation.org/ plugin
[14:28:05] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack remove the quotes around 'this' - it's $(this).
[14:28:17] <jeffmjack> yep that works robertmaxrees
[14:28:24] <jeffmjack> btw robertmaxrees you are my hero
[14:28:31] <dmsuperman> he's the hero we need
[14:28:33] <dmsuperman> not the hero we deserve
[14:28:35] <jeffmjack> you are always here answering questions like a boss I really appreciate it
[14:28:37] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:28:42] <robertmaxrees> hey, thanks!
[14:28:46] <jeffmjack> :D :D
[14:29:34] <jeffmjack> dmsuperman: truth :P
[14:30:43] <dmsuperman> it's a shame IRC helping doesn't have much publicity, I feel like a clever employer would do well to join these channels and just see who helps out a lot
[14:31:18] <respek> ^ truth
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of really smart people.
[14:32:08] <robertmaxrees> though a lot of them have great jobs already.
[14:32:34] <dmsuperman> yeah but the best time to leave a job is when things are going well I find
[14:32:40] <dmsuperman> better than leaving when things are shit.
[14:32:45] <robertmaxrees> depending yeha.
[14:33:18] <dmsuperman> there's always better opportunities, obviously to be weighed against loyalty. but we live in capitalism and loyalty generally only goes one way
[14:33:52] <dmsuperman> so I feel no remorse for leaving something good for something great. I'm always open to interviews haha
[14:34:02] <dmsuperman> on the other hand I always give notice and opportunities to counter offer
[14:34:14] <robertmaxrees> it really depends for me on a lot of factors.
[14:34:44] <dmsuperman> yeah it's not that simple. a good job with good coworkers will always be worth a certain amount of compensation deduction. just in general
[14:35:25] <dmsuperman> at the end of the day I work a job to build up my nest egg and retire and if I can find another opportunity with the same amount of job quality but higher compensation, that's just that much sooner I can retire
[14:35:56] <robertmaxrees> i stash money away for retirement, sure, but I do it because i enjoy the work.
[14:36:06] <robertmaxrees> money is a part of that puzzle, but not the whole point for me.
[14:36:26] <dmsuperman> I definitely enjoy the work but the primary goal is still money. if money weren't a part of it I'd be writing vastly different code
[14:36:55] <respek> like what? art? that's what I'd be doing, I know that's for sure
[14:37:23] <dmsuperman> even if it were like the perfect coding environment, if it's work, it loses its luster for me
[14:37:30] <dmsuperman> an obligation to keep going even when I don't want to
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> i have a lot of autonomy at work, so if doesn't feel like "work" most days.
[14:38:08] <jeffmjack> I have a small business in food that produces 80K/year with basically no work on my part... so I've been playing with computers.  I don't think retirement is all it's cracked up to be, although you certainly learn a lot about yourself when you have 100% free time
[14:38:26] <dmsuperman> I mean something more like partial retirement
[14:38:28] <dmsuperman> I'd still work
[14:38:32] <CorySimmons> Anyone know of a plugin like this http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/ that will make the elements fly back out the way they came in if the user scrolls up?
[14:38:34] <dmsuperman> but it would be nice to not *have* to work
[14:38:43] <dmsuperman> it's the obligation I hate
[14:38:52] <jeffmjack> so if 'this' gives me the form, how do I get to the inputs nested in that form?
[14:39:01] <dmsuperman> jeffmjack: for what?
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('input')
[14:39:09] <dmsuperman> $(this).find(':input') though
[14:39:09] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:39:15] <respek> CorySimmons: anijs perhaps or skrollr
[14:39:24] <CorySimmons> Thanks respek
[14:39:37] <respek> you're welcome
[14:39:53] <dmsuperman> respek: art, motorcycles, music, etc...
[14:39:58] <dmsuperman> the stuff I do with my freetime already
[14:40:01] <jeffmjack> awesome thanks!
[14:40:03] <dmsuperman> I'd do more of it
[14:40:40] <dmsuperman> I DJ and there's so many cool opportunities I see for using my programming background in the DJ world. but there's just not much money in it
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> well yeah, it's music hahaha
[14:41:57] <robertmaxrees> i roughly break even on most gigs.
[14:42:21] <Robdgreat> so it's a sustainable hobby
[14:42:29] <robertmaxrees> barely, but yeah.
[14:43:17] <dmsuperman> yeah I'm at a huge loss with DJing
[14:43:44] <dmsuperman> that's why I put money first with work, to offset the losses in all my hobbies
[14:43:46] <dmsuperman> which make me basically nothing
[14:44:00] <dmsuperman> motorcycles especially lol
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'll bet
[14:46:15] <duckxx> jsbin vs jsfiddle vs codepen... what does everyone prefer and why?
[14:46:49] <robertmaxrees> i personally prefer jsfiddle because it encourages paired down examples.
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> and it's the one i spend the most time in.
[14:47:59] <decx> love fiddle, hate codepen. neutral on bin
[14:48:49] <duckxx> why hate codepen ?
[14:49:05] <decx> it's slow and ugly
[14:49:50] <mchelen1> fwiw i used to use fiddle, and now use jsb
[14:49:53] <mchelen1> *jsbin
[14:50:11] <mchelen1> i like how customizable it is
[14:50:36] <dmsuperman> fiddle seems a little more intuitive for updates and sharing code changes
[14:50:39] <mchelen1> fiddle might be more user friendly though
[14:50:58] <dmsuperman> I like that jsbin has a console built in but it tends to be less usful than the native console
[14:51:04] <dmsuperman> so I end up hiding it and using my native console anyway
[14:51:26] <mchelen1> i like the fiddle ui, but i cant figure out how to show/hide stuff like css
[14:51:31] <mchelen1> for times when im not using it
[14:52:03] <decx> i like the consistence
[14:52:27] <mchelen1> jsbin lets me have more minimalist interface
[14:52:54] <CorySimmons> respek: Eh, neither of those plugins really provide a way to "reverse" the animation on scroll up
[14:53:04] <decx> i iwll always know where html, css, js and output is regardless of who does the fiddle
[14:53:12] <decx> without even looking
[14:53:29] <mchelen1> yeah its more an issue when im working on something
[14:53:35] <mchelen1> and all i care about is js and console
[14:53:39] <respek> skrollr does, if you scroll back up, the affects are reversed
[14:53:53] <mchelen1> dont want to give up the screen space for html & css & output
[14:53:57] <respek> unless I'm misunderstanding you
[14:54:41] <duckxx> so codepen is a no go i guess
[14:55:30] <decx> it's superpopular outside of this channel
[14:56:20] <mchelen1> yeah i see a fair number of ppl use it
[14:56:29] <mchelen1> try them all & see what you like :D
[14:56:38] <CorySimmons> respek: I suppose.... lemme read into it a bit
[14:56:51] <duckxx> i'd like to use what the hardcore js guys use here.... i dont want to go shop around and waste time.. just go with what everyone else uses.
[14:57:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:57:07] <robertmaxrees> we all have our own preferences.
[14:57:15] <robertmaxrees> i just whip open the console half the time and go with that.
[15:01:39] <droid909> is there a way i can send POST to a certain url via jquery?
[15:01:50] <droid909> as if i submited a forM?
[15:01:58] <robertmaxrees> you have to make the form.
[15:02:03] <robertmaxrees> you can make that form via ajax.
[15:02:06] <robertmaxrees> err, via jquery
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need to use ajax
[15:02:24] <respek> CorySimmons:  I guarantee that it does. I've used it personally
[15:02:33] <CorySimmons> respek: Thanks
[15:02:39] <droid909> robertmaxrees: so i create form and then trigger submit via jquery?
[15:02:40] <CorySimmons> Seems like it does.
[15:02:47] <robertmaxrees> droid909 yep.
[15:03:20] <respek> CorySimmons: maybe you'd like this more though: http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[15:03:42] <CorySimmons> hah no
[15:03:51] <CorySimmons> Scrollorama is a bit too complicated for my tastes
[15:04:45] <dmsuperman> robertmaxrees: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/  ?
[15:04:49] <dmsuperman> does that just generate a form?
[15:05:01] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman nope.
[15:05:11] <dmsuperman> what am I missing, isn't that what he's asking about?
[15:05:14] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you what it does :) - "This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:"
[15:05:29] <robertmaxrees> if he can't use ajax, then he can't use $.post()
[15:05:53] <droid909> robertmaxrees: why can't i?
[15:06:03] <robertmaxrees> are you posting cross-domain?
[15:06:09] <dmsuperman> oh I see
[15:06:10] <droid909> robertmaxrees: no
[15:06:17] <robertmaxrees> then give $.post() a try
[15:06:29] <robertmaxrees> that's just a shorthand for ajax.
[15:06:46] <droid909> robertmaxrees: will it work exactlry as if i submited a form?
[15:06:53] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> it'll submit via ajax
[15:06:58] <droid909> :(
[15:07:12] <CorySimmons> respek: Yup skroller works perfect. Cool plugin too. Thanks! =)
[15:07:32] <robertmaxrees> droid909 try it and see - it might work just fine in your case.
[15:07:34] <mooncup> 23:06 < droid909> robertmaxrees: will it work exactlry as if i submited a form?
[15:07:42] <respek> CorySimmons: you're welcome :)
[15:07:42] <mooncup> it works the same from the server's perspective
[15:07:59] <mooncup> except for an extra header sent specifying it was sent via ajax
[15:08:17] <respek> robertmaxrees: it wasn't technical support, but I did offer some support by knowing about a library! w00t
[15:08:18] <dmsuperman> mooncup: that's not "works the same" then ;)
[15:08:27] <robertmaxrees> respek hahaha
[15:08:28] <mooncup> no it's not
[15:08:33] <robertmaxrees> sometimes that's good enough.
[15:08:34] <mooncup> but for all practical purposes it is
[15:09:23] <respek> :)
[15:09:47] <definity> Hi
[15:09:56] <definity> Hi, Is there a lib where i can put content in tiles that have 3 sizes and auto configure themselves to fit together in a enat way?
[15:10:01] <definity> 3 fixed sizes
[15:10:08] <definity> neat*
[15:10:25] <mooncup> bootstrap? Though I guess that's complete overkill
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> masonry and its ilk
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> depending on what exactly you mean, that is.
[15:17:34] <droid909> thank you guyz
[15:19:54] <definity> robertmaxrees: what do you mean by ilk?
[15:21:22] <dmsuperman> similarly related items
[15:23:34] <decx> is there a name for that?
[15:23:48] <decx> justified floats or something ^^
[15:24:12] <respek> CorySimmons: if you're not too far down the rabbit hole, here's a third http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/
[15:25:00] <CorySimmons> respek: Yeah still fooling around trying to get skrollr to do what I'd like for it to do. TBH, I'm surprised there aren't 50 plugins for this already.
[15:25:43] <dmsuperman> I'm glad there aren't, I like my eyes to not bleed
[15:25:44] <dmsuperman> ;P
[15:26:15] <respek> it's because it's hard, and ppl suck at using it usually
[15:26:29] <decx> it's not actually that hard
[15:27:51] <CorySimmons> dmsuperman: You like your eyes not to bleed? From what? SVGs animating in and out depending on scroll position?
[15:28:01] <dmsuperman> yes
[15:28:02] <respek> I was referring to design, which is pretty clearly the case sadly.
[15:28:33] <CorySimmons> Meeeh
[15:28:53] <respek> bye all! wish I could stay for the debate :D
[15:29:02] <CorySimmons> heh later thanks respek
[15:35:25] <Duvdevan> <>
[15:50:17] <cj> so I've done a profile of my page
[15:50:36] <cj> and it says that there is a lot of b.event.add/v.handle happening
[15:50:45] <cj> does this mean that I've got my event handlers hooked up all wrong?
[16:17:56] <rubyonrailed> How can I change my html wiht jquery? I'm trying this, and it's not working https://gist.github.com/anonymous/568937aefac61e0060ad
[16:22:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> what is that trying to do?
[16:25:32] <decx> unless it's a code example for haml i dont get it ^^
[16:26:52] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed are you trying to render something out of ruby?
[16:27:14] <rubyonrailed> Yeah, now i'm just toggling between each different thing I need
[16:27:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[16:27:54] <robertmaxrees> you're JS doesn't know anything about ruby.
[16:27:57] <robertmaxrees> and vice versa.
[16:29:36] <rubyonrailed> Now I have something like this:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1aa75b3f308b749e5a4f  but it will only switch once
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> the event binding is the important part.
[16:42:20] <yoloswaggins> johat’s the name of the design patern where I have functions that do stuff, but then I have click event handlers that find data, and then call the functions. This is in contrast to when the function also finds the data.
[16:46:04] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[16:46:16] <robertmaxrees> because that sounds like it starts getting into functional territory
[17:02:52] <droid909> if to submit button i'll add onclick='' will onclick be executed before the form is submitted?
[17:03:58] <robertmaxrees> don't use that.
[17:04:02] <robertmaxrees> bind using .on()
[17:04:04] <mocsrox> any chance jquery can do complicated selector mechanics? e.g. AND and OR of different class selectors?
[17:04:47] <mocsrox> i know jquery can do things like $('.class1,.class2,.class3')
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> mocsrox just like you would with otherwise.
[17:04:53] <decx> it's all and because or would imply that it matters when nothing is found which it does not
[17:05:05] <mocsrox> which selects by OR
[17:05:05] <decx> man that was a hard sentence
[17:05:21] <mocsrox> and also does $('.class1.class2.class3')
[17:05:24] <mocsrox> which does it by AND
[17:05:33] <decx> yeah but that's juts one selector
[17:05:34] <mocsrox> is it possible to mix the two?
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> mocsrox not without chaining and stuff.
[17:06:04] <mocsrox> how would i chain by AND?
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out using .filter()
[17:06:27] <decx> maybe it's late but i dont get what you try to do ^^
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, what you had before should be sufficient.
[17:06:44] <mocsrox> im trying to get these semantics: (.class1, .class2, .class3) AND (.classA, .classb)
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> $('.class1, .class2, .class3').has('.classA, .classb') might work
[17:07:49] <decx> i think it's supposed to be $('.class1.class2.class3, .classA.classb'
[17:08:21] <mocsrox> @decx does that work? how does it know to group like taht?
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:08:31] <decx> it's just 2 selectors
[17:08:45] <decx> $('a,b')
[17:08:55] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you all elements that have .class1.class2.class3 AND all elements that have .classA.classb
[17:09:12] <Streemo> Hey guys. If I have an element like this: <a href='{{isActive}}'>, where isActive is  a function helper for the template, is there any way I can access, relatively, the encompassing 'a' tag from within that function.
[17:09:29] <Streemo> using jQ
[17:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you're not putting javascript code in the href, are you?
[17:10:01] <Streemo> no
[17:10:10] <Streemo> its the return value of a javascript function
[17:10:14] <robertmaxrees> then i don't know what you're doing.  can you provide an example?
[17:10:43] <droid909> i have a submit button how do i do something and submit it?
[17:11:02] <droid909> upon clicking on it
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> prevent the default event, do your logic, then trigger submit.
[17:12:19] <droid909> robertmaxrees: .submit() ?
[17:12:26] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('submit')
[17:12:27] <Streemo> robertmaxrees do you know how to access an element tag from a certain point within the html?
[17:12:27] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> Streemo that question doesn't make any sense without seeing some code.
[17:13:05] <robertmaxrees> droid909 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h0ypdsnc/1/ something like this.
[17:15:05] <mocsrox> beautiful.  filter does the right thing.  thx @robertmaxrees
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:15:38] <robertmaxrees> btw this isn't twitter - no need for the @ ;)
[17:15:52] <yoloswaggins> What’s the name of the design patern where I have functions that do stuff, but then I have click event handlers that find data, and then call the function. This is in contrast to when the function also finds the data. EX: http://pastie.org/9684537
[17:16:16] <robertmaxrees> yoloswaggins sounds like functional code to me, sort of.
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> you're just being DRY
[17:16:29] <yoloswaggins> Right.
[17:16:40] <yoloswaggins> So I’m not using a specific patern?
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> you're abstracting things the right way.
[17:17:52] <yoloswaggins> I was hoping there was a name for that technique, but it’s the ‘the right way’ then I’m satisfied.
[17:22:42] <Streemo> robertmaxtrees i have a different solution, im ditching the jQ solution since it is brittle in this case
[17:23:38] <Streemo> basically i was just wondering if JQ was aware of the scope of where the code is
[17:24:10] <Streemo> something like <tag> JQ accessing tag via some "parent" keyword or something </tag>
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> Streemo depending on how you're calling it, yes.
[17:24:51] <robertmaxrees> but i have no clue what you're doing, so it's almost impossible to say
[17:25:32] <Streemo> well its simple im just using a template helper function within an A tag to give it a class of 'active' if the current path matches the path that the a tag goes to.
[17:26:31] <Streemo> so i was hoping there was a way to access it a "realtive" way rather than an "absolute" way. it'd be easy to do in the absolute case..
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> how are you using the template helper?
[17:27:18] <robertmaxrees> can you provide code to illustrate what you're doing?
[17:27:28] <Streemo> yeah sure
[17:27:29] <Streemo> one sec.
[17:31:37] <Streemo> https://gist.github.com/Streemo/3a583ea3516401841595
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> this is a question for your templating system.
[17:32:29] <Streemo> pathFor is impletmented by the Router
[17:32:49] <robertmaxrees> it entirely depends on what the templating system is binding the helper to.,
[17:33:00] <Streemo> you could've told me that without seeing my code
[17:33:03] <Streemo> o.o
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> i had no idea what you were trying to do.
[17:33:31] <Streemo> i thought i clearly expresed that what im doing is closely bound to my template
[17:33:38] <Streemo> ^
[17:33:44] <robertmaxrees> "my template" can mean all kinds of things.
[17:33:56] <Streemo> but those things
[17:33:59] <Streemo> are all templates
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter.
[17:34:45] <Streemo> lol
[17:34:47] <P0rk> I should be able to store a regular expression in an elements data-reg attribute like <div data-reg=/(\w+)/i >  ?
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> you could try, but I wouldn't.
[17:37:18] <P0rk> aha, maybe I could store the string "\\w+" and then  use something like : var x=new RegExp($(".el").first().data("reg"));  ?
[17:37:41] <robertmaxrees> why are you storing regular expressions in your markup in the first place?
[17:38:49] <P0rk> I am creating a method to make reusable polymorphic objects for form elements that need to have part of their name attribute updated when the element is cloned.
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> I'd store that logic separately, but i could see where your idea would make sense.
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> data-* attributes need to be wrapped in quotes per HTML iirc.
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> then pass the string to the RegExp constructor to pop out what you want.
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[17:42:55] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ne3mf5gu/
[17:43:26] <robertmaxrees> need to pagg the flags.
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> *pass
[17:43:40] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:51:35] <P0rk> okay, how about this: the names for my elements are ugly in js. They look like: "q[4].roommate[3].name" and I want to add roommate 4...
[17:52:06] <decx> you push() him down the stairs
[17:52:38] <decx> and what's with the regexp for a wordcount
[17:52:49] <P0rk> my holder for the "roommate" object is <div class='roommate expandable'> so I can separate our the "roommate" part to build the regexp
[17:52:52] <decx> what's wrong with string.trim().split(' ').length
[17:53:04] <robertmaxrees> P0rk wait so you want to replace a class?
[17:54:11] <P0rk> no, I am trying to make this thing polymorphic, so I can create a roommate object with a bunch of inputs, then a brothers object with different inputs and be able to clone these things while maintaining a reasonable naming convention
[17:55:03] <P0rk> so, by making my formula iterate over all the inputs in any of these objects, renaming just the "roommate" number or "brother" number it'll work.
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that with your HTML like that, though?  Why not use a tempalting engine?
[17:55:15] <robertmaxrees> *templating
[17:55:25] <P0rk> or hire someone else to do it for me, that's a great idea
[17:55:33] <P0rk> or I could learn a little.
[17:55:38] <P0rk> It's hard to say
[17:55:46] <robertmaxrees> it just feels like you're going about it "the hard way"
[17:56:24] <P0rk> you sound like my mom...she's 80 something
[17:56:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm just speaking from experience.
[17:56:57] <P0rk> that was supposed to be funny, not rude, by the way...sorry if I missed it
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> totally cool
[17:57:22] <decx> i still dont get what's the endgoal
[17:57:25] <P0rk> See, I haven't found any nice tools that do what I want
[17:57:37] <robertmaxrees> part of the problem is you're approaching it very strangely.
[17:57:40] <P0rk> gimme just a second, I'll show you a fiddle
[18:00:45] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5k2pw436/12/
[18:00:53] <P0rk> really bad and rushed example
[18:02:16] <robertmaxrees> you wnat to basically build templating into HTML.
[18:03:53] <decx> i know even less what's going on now
[18:04:07] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5k2pw436/15/
[18:04:23] <P0rk> In seconds, I was able to create a pet object, or really any other object
[18:04:36] <robertmaxrees> imo you're munging logic and data.
[18:04:44] <P0rk> it is expandable, meaning by clicking on the expand button, it shows details
[18:04:44] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best way to prevent $.ajax() to run if a given form element hasn't been defined
[18:05:03] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque by using an if statement
[18:05:09] <P0rk> and now I am trying to make it duplicable (sp?)
[18:05:23] <jeffreylevesque> so, simply wrap $.ajax() with an if statement
[18:05:39] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[18:05:43] <P0rk> but that means that in the name attribute of ever element, I need to change the number in the brackets after the object name
[18:05:48] <jeffreylevesque> easy enough
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> P0rk these little issues are why I suggest you instead use another templating system.
[18:06:19] <robertmaxrees> underscore's are pretty easy.
[18:16:57] <P0rk> decx, split worked. It's not pretty, but it works.
[18:19:46] <doug64k> rapidly changing images aren't annoying at all http://www.jstraight.com/1133/2
[18:26:28] <systemfault> doug64k: optimization :P http://www.jstraight.com/1133/4
[18:26:33] <systemfault> doug64k: Warning, not for people with epilepsy :(
[18:34:42] <doug64k> systemfault: nice
[18:43:01] <fridaynext> What's the easiest image slider plugin I can use to achieve something like this - http://flexslider.woothemes.com/thumbnail-slider.html
[18:45:01] <BillCriswell> fridaynext: They're the docs for an image slider you can use.
[18:46:29] <jeffreylevesque> how can I check whether a string is a valid URL, in the shortest possible way?
[18:46:41] <jeffreylevesque> is there a nice jquery method, or do i have to use regex?
[18:46:57] <fridaynext> BillCriswell: what are the docs?
[18:47:42] <BillCriswell> fridaynext: http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[18:47:50] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Hmmm...
[18:48:24] <BillCriswell> What do you mean by vlaid? Does it need to be a full url or is a relative url all right?
[18:48:50] <jeffreylevesque> full, for now.  Later, i will implement a jquery validation library
[18:49:04] <jeffreylevesque> so, perhaps use regex for now?
[18:50:28] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Hmm
[18:54:14] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: If you look at a <a> element you can get the host, path and crap through that. I'm thinking that might be a little better?
[18:58:21] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Eh maybe a regex would work.
[18:58:26] <BillCriswell> Well, definitely would.
[19:27:24] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/4rb98852/ is this possible? I mean can I address to img#bpluzimg.minus ?
[19:27:51] <Solcero> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0e87aa61f547dabd7acc  hi, someone an idea why this snippet doesn't work ? nothing happens on click..
[19:42:49] <P0rk> Horacsio, I think so..
[19:42:56] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/4rb98852/1/
[19:43:04] <Horacsio> yes it does but...
[19:44:07] <P0rk> ...
[19:45:59] <Horacsio> but: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/4rb98852/3/ what happens is when I click in img#bpluzimg.minus the script repeats all again making it fadein fadeout the backgroundcolor.
[19:47:52] <Horacsio> I need that background color to fadeout: http://baannng.com/land-of-toys/ and fadein when on click
[19:49:35] <P0rk> you have defined a click handler inside of a click handler
[19:50:10] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/4rb98852/4/
[19:50:10] <Horacsio> yes I know but how do I isolate the clicks?
[19:50:37] <P0rk> use classes
[19:51:00] <P0rk> set your css background-color for the two classes and swap classes
[19:51:13] <P0rk> to animate it then, use built-in css transitions.
[19:53:38] <Horacsio> so I need to addClass a new class to #bpluzimg right?
[19:54:20] <Horacsio> or can I work with minus?
[19:57:15] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/4rb98852/9/
[19:57:53] <P0rk> don't use header as an id. it messes things up
[19:58:15] <Horacsio> ok
[19:59:05] <Horacsio> I’m checking for opacity… but that doesnt work well too :D
[19:59:22] <P0rk> huh?
[20:00:14] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/4rb98852/11/
[20:00:43] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/4rb98852/13/
[20:01:11] <P0rk> add some html to your fiddle to make it valid. Its useless as a pastebin copy
[20:01:55] <P0rk> why are you using .data("minus")?
[20:03:53] <Horacsio> did you saw the link I’ve sent?
[20:04:07] <P0rk> there is no html there
[20:04:17] <Horacsio> not the jsfidle
[20:04:23] <Horacsio> http://baannng.com/land-of-toys/
[20:04:35] <Horacsio> it toggles all that information there
[20:06:05] <P0rk> did you load Chrome dev tools and look at the console?
[20:06:18] <Horacsio> no. why?
[20:06:29] <P0rk> You have js errors. self.media_rule_has_columns_selector=function (rules)    is throwing an error
[20:06:39] <P0rk> rules is undefined
[20:12:17] <Horacsio> that’s related to salvatore jq plugin
[20:24:19] <Horacsio> P0rk: I’ve isolated things :D the same effect less code!
[20:24:26] <Horacsio> http://baannng.com/land-of-toys/
[20:29:38] <Horacsio> Thank you for the help ;)
[20:51:17] <P0rk> srry, np
[20:51:53] <P0rk> what is the method to get out of a while loop? I thought it was break, but not so.
[20:53:08] <Jattenalle> it's break
[20:53:46] <Jattenalle> P0rk, ^^
[20:54:12] <P0rk> cool. Must be some other reason I'm getting "invalid break command" in console...
[21:11:56] <BeWilled> why when using jquery mobile with ajax its apends a #/ to the uri and what can I do to stop it?
[21:34:32] <z1haze> when using jquery to slide to id's using anchor tags, is there a way to adjust how far it slides? like typically it brings it to the very top of the viewing window, id rather it display it in the middle of the page
[21:47:27] <Botanic> is there any way to incrimently or realtime load a webpage into a div?
[21:47:49] <Botanic> using jquery? was looking at xmlhttprequest but id rather use jquery if possible
[22:27:32] <jphase> Cork: out of curiosity, re: our znc conversation earlier; you're connecting via your own self-hosted znc bouncer I assume yes? and when you speak of the benefits of logs it's primarily about reading back on logs that are stored post-znc-connection or do you somehow have the znc log chat that I'm not aware of? (znc used to just be a bounced server when I used to use it - didn't really benefit from a bounce server proxy in regards to logging chat)
[22:32:45] * jphase is realizing the log benefits from using now that he reads up - I would have to connect to it prior to connecting to freenode though. so it seems it's still as I remember it
[22:33:01] <Uhkis> screen + irssi ftw
[22:33:13] <jphase> Uhkis: couldn't agree more
[22:33:19] <jphase> I used to use that solely
[22:34:19] <jphase> now that I'm on mac for work I'm accustomed to limechat - not that's it's better by any means, but it's nice in terms of a just-add-water client
[22:34:21] <Uhkis> it's accessible from pretty much anywhere
[22:34:30] <jphase> Uhkis++;
[22:34:54] <Uhkis> macs do have terminal, get that irssi back!
[22:35:00] <jphase> of course
[22:35:33] <Uhkis> connecting to irssi from phone is a bit too easy tbh, just swipe once and irssi is open :D
[22:35:43] <jphase> one of the only things I like about limechat in terms of an irc client is the added "pasted" bells and whistles for rendering images and videos
[22:36:29] <jphase> I used to only connect via screen + irssi in terminal but now I'm trying to us additional client-side apps - limechat is my current
[22:37:03] <Uhkis> why?
[22:37:30] <jphase> well - can never, of course, replace the terminal epic-sauce of irssi - but I'm toying with the added features some other OS-level alternatives have
[22:37:56] <Uhkis> you forgot "pointless" from there ;)
[22:38:03] <jphase> hah
[22:38:38] <jphase> namely the cmd + v (insert option to paste via random gist paste)
[22:41:58] <Uhkis> it uploads to gists and pastes the gist link?
[22:45:48] <ThomasCrown> jphase: thank you for all your help the other night.
[22:45:54] <ThomasCrown> I got my stuff working properly
[22:53:04] <jphase> ThomasCrown: word up
[22:54:10] <jphase> Uhkis: I'm not ever going to say your opinion is wrong btw - because I cmopletely agree with irssi as the common approach - and am subsequently a total terminal fanatic - but I do like to toy with other clients. now that I'm bound to OSX I'm branching out <3
[22:54:55] <Uhkis> macs make ppl dumber, confirmed! ;D
[22:55:27] <ftsf> hi everyone, i'm having an issue where removeClass is not actually removing the specified class.. has anyone experienced this or know how it might happen or be fixed?
[22:55:58] <Uhkis> !paste @ ftsf
[22:55:58] <b-ot> ftsf: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:56:48] <ftsf> hmm I don't have a test case unfortunately, I'll see if I can create one.
[22:57:09] <Uhkis> ftsf: very likely your selector is wrong
[22:57:26] <ftsf> Uhkis, i thought so too, but the selector returns the correct object
[22:59:02] <jphase> lol, Uhkis, mac is just open bsd with a solid OS - you either go linux or you don't imho - the only reason I use mac is to use the adobe suite and still have a unix-based terminal
[22:59:35] <jphase> by solid I literally just mean vigorous testing - I'm a linux guy - not a mac guy </opinion> ;)
[23:05:06] <Uhkis> jphase++ for being a linux guy!
[23:05:52] <jphase> heh, ditto
[23:08:47] <Uhkis> so what's your distro of choice?
[23:10:11] <ftsf> i'm an archlinux person o/
[23:10:41] <Uhkis> i'm also currently totally migrated to arch
[23:11:19] <Uhkis> just like (what it seems) 90% of gentoo people
[23:12:22] <jphase> centos for production
[23:13:29] <jphase> at work I do nginx + php-fpm + memcached ( or batcache on wordpress stuff ) + whatever else I need - node.js and all that jazz
[23:13:49] <jphase> s/or/APC object cache
[23:14:23] <Uhkis> wAPC object cachedpress? ;D
[23:15:00] <ftsf> ok, i was wrong, the class is being removed, it's just being immediately added again
[23:17:22] <ftsf> anyone played with spectrum.js much?
[23:17:40] <ftsf> i'm trying to get it to pop open a color selector when i click an element.
