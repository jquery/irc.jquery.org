[00:03:44] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: console.log(price) at line 652
[00:06:14] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  That just (for me) logs the value of the option price, not the "pink price"
[00:06:29] <fRAiLtY-> If you select all 4 options you get more options, you'll see what I mean
[00:06:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then where are you changing it?
[00:06:57] <Cork> reading through your entire page to try to find where it happens will take quite some time
[00:07:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: : http://pastie.org/6093399 There's the reloadPrice function that, reloads the price I'm pretty sure. You can see line 54 is where I added what you suggested
[00:09:04] <Cork> sure?
[00:09:11] <Cork> but you can't log what the function does
[00:09:19] <Cork> you send it the new value, so just log that
[00:09:25] <Cork> or edit the changePrice function
[00:10:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Hmm, changePrice just is this: this.optionPrices[key] = price;
[00:10:34] <fRAiLtY-> That's all
[00:10:46] <Cork> then i don't see the problem
[00:10:50] <Cork> just log price??
[00:10:56] <fRAiLtY-> in changePrice ?
[00:11:06] <Cork> depends on where you want it
[00:11:32] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Ultimately I want it to display on the page below the pink price, as I'm doing a calc with it
[00:11:38] <DarsVaeda> hi, in a dialog I swap a list element with a input the problem is that I can only write in that input if I keep pressing the left mousebutton
[00:11:48] <DarsVaeda> anyone ever stumbled over this?
[00:11:59] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so have an extra element and set it with the value?
[00:12:31] <fRAiLtY-> $('element').text(price) right? But in changePrice?
[00:12:53] <cyro> how do you make a click call back open a new url?
[00:13:46] <cyro> I want to have $('button.foo').click(function(e) { â€¦ }); have effects on the same page under some conditions and go to a new page under different conditions
[00:13:59] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i don't see why you need it in changePrice
[00:14:02] <Cork> but ya
[00:14:23] <cyro> oh do I use window.open
[00:14:32] <Cork> cyro: window.location = 'new url';
[00:14:54] <cyro> Cork: thx
[00:15:06] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Because if I do it in reloadPrice is just returns the option value, not the overall "pink price"
[00:15:36] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh, you want the original value before the change?
[00:15:52] <fRAiLtY-> No the overall value
[00:15:54] <fRAiLtY-> I can get the original value
[00:16:11] <fRAiLtY-> But if the option is +60, console.log(price) returns 60
[00:16:14] <fRAiLtY-> not the price + 60
[00:24:41] <David> Hello
[00:25:01] <fRAiLtY-> Cork ^^
[00:25:20] <David> I was wondering if anyone was in here that might help with strange issues I'm experiencing with loading the jQuery framework from google CDN
[00:26:00] <gf3> `ask @ David
[00:26:02] <b-ot> David: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:26:31] <mvta> morning all
[00:26:49] <David> okay - we used to load jquery libraries using the google.load("jquery", "1") call
[00:26:56] <David> that should load the latest version
[00:27:22] <David> we also use kendoUI (which to be honest, I'm not such a big fan off)
[00:27:23] <dnl_tp> i'm looking for a splitter in jquery ui, well maintained... any advice?
[00:27:24] <gf3> David: Curious, why don't you simply include the script?
[00:27:28] <David> today, some of the functionality was broken
[00:27:55] <David> gf3 - I don't know why this path was chosen
[00:27:57] <David> anyway
[00:28:25] <David> actually - I know - it's because the loaded frameworks are configured in metadata
[00:28:26] <David> anyway
[00:28:38] <David> today, it loads version 1.7.1
[00:29:18] <jomofcw> Hello !
[00:29:27] <jomofcw> Hello gnarf ! Thanks for your message and your example =).
[00:29:58] <jomofcw> gnarf please, is that' "scrollLeft" properties a css thing ?
[00:39:08] <geiregjo> Morning
[00:39:57] <geiregjo> Does anyone have some in depth knowledge of JQM? I'm trying to understand how the elements are enhanced. I'm looking into initializePage function to find the entrypoint of everything but I can't find it...
[00:40:44] <geiregjo> The reason I'm doing this is because of a controlgroup which is part of a dynamically added page. And it's not enhanced like the other components
[00:55:16] <dblosevn> ?jquery.scrollLeft @ jomofcw
[00:55:18] <bot-t> jomofcw, .scrollLeft() | jQuery API Documentation - Get the current horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[01:00:57] <jomofcw> hello dblosevn, yup but he uses it in an animate function as a propertie.
[01:03:44] <dblosevn> jomofcw: yes you can animate scrollLeft like most other properties in jquery
[01:08:41] <fRAiLtY-> if dynamicPrice returns 24.70 how to round that down and multiply * 10?
[01:09:18] <AdamPDotty> Math.round()
[01:09:33] <AdamPDotty> or
[01:09:34] <AdamPDotty> floor
[01:09:49] <gf3> js> print(Math.round(24.7) * 10)
[01:10:08] <gf3> OR NOT
[01:10:12] <gf3> IT'S COOL b-ot
[01:10:17] <gf3> YOU JUST RELAX, BIG GUY
[01:10:42] <b-ot> gf3: 250
[01:10:56] <AdamPDotty> ok, was a hrad calculation
[01:11:09] <fRAiLtY-> Am trying this: jQuery('#earnpoints').text('You will earn ' +Math.floor(parseInt(dynamicPrice))*10+ ' points when buying this!');
[01:11:25] <fRAiLtY-> dynamicPrice returns 24.70 or other numbers, but I get NaN ?
[01:12:19] <gf3> AdamPDotty: Fuckin' magnets, man
[01:12:48] <gf3> fRAiLtY-: No need for Math.round if you're using parseInt
[01:13:07] <fRAiLtY-> But I need to ensure it's rounded down first
[01:13:09] <fRAiLtY-> then * 10
[01:13:23] <fRAiLtY-> I think because it's a string I need to convert to integer first?
[01:13:39] <AdamPDotty> what happens when you round an integer?
[01:13:54] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[01:14:07] <fRAiLtY-> Ahaa, wait
[01:14:12] <AdamPDotty> maybe dynamicPrice is " 27.40" ?
[01:14:13] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: try var dynamicprice = Math.floor(dynamicPrice) || 0;
[01:14:42] <fRAiLtY-> No, currency sign :D
[01:14:45] <fRAiLtY-> Just realised
[01:14:49] <fRAiLtY-> have to chop the first char off
[01:14:56] <dblosevn> your flooring after type casting to integer
[01:15:09] <dblosevn> floor does nothing in this case
[01:15:31] <dblosevn> as integers dont have a decimal value
[01:16:06] <Qdest> Cork: Thanks for the assistance yday! I'm almost finished, I just need to know how to use the $filteredItems at line 27. If I do $filteredItems.hide(); it won't work. Need to know how to "select" them to in turn send it to quicksand for animation
[01:16:11] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/9/
[01:17:23] <dblosevn> fRAiLtY-: also Math.floor returns an integer so theres no need to parseInt at all
[01:18:49] <dblosevn> and stripping the $ from dynamicPrice wouldnt hurt either lmao
[01:20:17] <Cork> Qdest: .hide() should work
[01:20:41] <Cork> Qdest: how long is $filteredItems.length for you there?
[01:20:45] <Qdest> Cork: I know right, well. I tried adding it after the console.log() but it doesn't seem to be able to "get" the elements in the div
[01:20:46] <Qdest> Cork: 2 sec
[01:21:09] <Qdest> Cork: oh, It's 0
[01:21:19] <Cork> and $data.length ?
[01:21:41] <Qdest> Cork: 1 at all times
[01:22:02] <Cork> console.log(filterClasses.join(','))
[01:22:32] <gf3> ?eval ['a', 'b', 'c'].join()
[01:22:34] <bot-t> gf3: "a,b,c"
[01:22:36] <Qdest> Cork: checking "app, dr" -> .app,.dr
[01:22:50] <Cork> hmm sounds resonable
[01:23:19] <Cork> ah right
[01:23:21] <Cork> $data.find('.project').length
[01:24:20] <Qdest> Cork: seems to be '2' at all times, probably due to 2 divs inside the parent?
[01:24:30] <Qdest> parent = .filter-posts
[01:24:53] <Cork> wait projects was on the li elements right?
[01:25:03] <Cork> * .project was
[01:25:20] <Qdest> Cork: nope, on the "div elements containing the stuff to filter"
[01:25:26] <Qdest> => div class="project kampanj film event">1</div>
[01:25:46] <Cork> well ok divs
[01:26:11] <Cork> and $('.project.app, .project.dr').length > 0 ?
[01:26:53] <Qdest> Cork: 2 sec, fiddle is really slow for me atm
[01:27:05] <Cork> ah.. i though you ran it on your site...
[01:27:07] <Qdest> it's returning true, so it's found
[01:27:18] <Qdest> not yet :)
[01:27:30] <Cork> then i can just as well test it my self >_>
[01:28:06] <Qdest> Well, true but I wouldn't "learn by doing" - I wouldn't have thought of running console.log(filterClasses.join(',')) if you hadn't said so - but now I know (duuh) shoud've thought of it tho :)
[01:28:37] <Qdest> but yeah, you could just do the testing real quick and tell me where the heck I'm going wrong ;D
[01:29:01] <Cork> Qdest: the problem is i don't understand why the selection fails
[01:29:27] <Qdest> That really is the problem isn't it? Cause I don't understand either :P
[01:29:57] <Cork> Qdest: give me a min
[01:30:17] <Cork> or make that 10 mins with the speed of that server...
[01:30:19] <Qdest> Cork: absolutely, I'll grab us a cup of coffee :)
[01:31:01] <Cork> oh shit...
[01:31:08] <Cork> man what a stupid mistake...
[01:31:41] <Qdest> Grabbing coffee? woot! Best mistake I did today
[01:32:08] <Cork> i used .has but i SHOULD know on the back of my hand that it won't work >_>
[01:32:09] <Qdest> While you're at it, how do I, if nothing is "selected" automatically select "all" again?
[01:32:12] <Cork> its .filter >_<
[01:32:15] <Qdest> ooh
[01:32:46] * Cork blames ie8 for it
[01:33:14] <Qdest> So, basically line 27 should be => $filteredItems = $data.find('.project').filter(filterClasses.join(','));  ?
[01:33:21] <Cork> yes
[01:33:34] <Qdest> and, if I do $filteredItems.hide(); and hit "app" the '2' should go away?
[01:33:50] <Cork> yes
[01:33:53] <DarsVaeda> when are selectors evaluated, first time code is loaded or if you call them?
[01:34:15] <Cork> DarsVaeda: every time you run a selector
[01:34:26] <Cork> as in explicitly run it
[01:34:30] <Cork> $()
[01:34:35] <Cork> or variable.find()
[01:35:01] <Qdest> Cork: hmm, seems to be the same as when we had .has(). http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/10/ right?
[01:35:14] <DarsVaeda> that's strange then, I run it and it returns it but the value in that case is empty, but if I do the same in the console it returns what is expected
[01:35:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: are you running it direct in a script tag in the head?
[01:36:04] <DarsVaeda> no it is in a file
[01:36:05] * Qdest thinks jsFiddle is incredibly slow at the moment
[01:38:49] <Qdest> Cork: bah fiddle went down completely for me. I'll get back to you when it has loaded successfully ;p
[01:39:03] <Cork> Qdest: ya i see that
[01:39:15] <Cork> ?p
[01:39:16] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:39:23] <DarsVaeda> Cork: the selector is nested in a .live(), might that be the problem?
[01:39:31] <Qdest> point being, the code I had was at fiddle so I can't fetch it lol
[01:39:46] <Cork> DarsVaeda: live is deprecated and should NOT be used
[01:40:00] <Cork> Qdest: ya
[01:40:05] <DarsVaeda> oh okay what instead?
[01:40:12] <Cork> ?.on
[01:40:14] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:40:14] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:40:15] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:40:18] <Cork> you pick
[01:40:23] <Cork> *your pick
[01:40:25] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks
[01:40:41] <Cork> DarkSector: they do have another syntax though, so make sure to check up on that
[01:40:56] <Cork> Qdest: lovely bad gateway >_>
[01:41:09] <Qdest> haha I got it too, 502 - however I managed to load /10 now
[01:41:23] <jomofcw> In this example (made by gnarf, thanks !) http://jsfiddle.net/ApTG8/ how can I make the carroussel stop when the last element appear ? And not when this last element is on the left "limit".
[01:41:25] <Qdest> unfortunately though it seems to act just as .has() did, it won't hide the 2 when hitting 'app'
[01:41:46] <Cork> Qdest: ya, let me check it, filter should do a much better job
[01:41:49] <Nebros> how i have to change this code http://bpaste.net/show/AtI1efnhziLq9S357Qtq/ when i will have the given value back into the option list with alternating colors?
[01:42:49] <nFFF> Im cannot figure out why, var x = $('.foo'); console.log(x); x.hide() // logs the correct element, but does hide the element?!
[01:42:57] <nFFF> It's only on my local computer
[01:43:06] <nFFF> Any ideas what could be causing this
[01:43:37] <Cork> nFFF: thats not really possible
[01:43:59] <nFFF> Well it's happening :D
[01:44:17] <Cork> and no error in the console?
[01:44:52] <nFFF> nope
[01:45:17] <Cork> put a breakpoint on the .hide() line and inspect what it does
[01:45:36] <Cork> btw have you made sure that the elements listed when you console.log it is the elements you want
[01:45:42] <Cork> and not another element?
[01:46:13] <nFFF> Yes, basically its to hide an element in the header, it works on half the pages in the site, but some it doesnt
[01:46:18] <nFFF> Cant figure out why
[01:46:28] <nFFF> I dont know how to add breakpoints :<
[01:46:36] <nFFF> jsfiddle is down else id show you
[01:46:42] <Cork> ya...
[01:46:43] <nFFF> whats the other site like fiddle
[01:46:48] <Cork> jsbin.com
[01:46:50] <nFFF> tinker?
[01:46:58] <Cork> webdevout.net
[01:47:12] <Cork> http://www.webdevout.net/test
[01:47:41] <nFFF> http://jsbin.com/ejiqiy/1/
[01:48:06] <nFFF> Oh wait, just looked at the console log, its not got any elements in it?
[01:48:37] <nFFF> Have chrome changed their log? im sure empty objects used to just show as <>
[01:49:24] <Cork> ... and now jsbin goes down...
[01:49:29] <Cork> seriusly?!?
[01:49:58] <gianiaz> hi, I want to use the jquery-ui-spinner to change the value in an input text area, the input text could contain px, em, percentage values, but in the example I can see demo only on currency and date time, do you know if there's a way to customize the measurement unit?
[01:51:47] <nFFF> Cork http://www.webdevout.net/test?05
[01:52:09] <nFFF> context: #document
[01:52:09] <nFFF> selector: "#cart-pop-over"
[01:52:09] <nFFF> __proto__: Object[0]
[01:52:14] <Cork> nFFF: i was hoping for a working page not a dump of the data
[01:52:15] <nFFF> that means its an empty object right?
[01:52:26] <Cork> check x.length
[01:55:37] <Cork> gianiaz: https://github.com/jquery/globalize#extend
[01:56:20] <DarsVaeda> I found my error somehow, seem I fail to understand a basic concept: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1623810/
[01:56:48] <gianiaz> Cork thank you, I'll take a look
[01:56:59] <DarsVaeda> can someone tell why in line 4 the output is as expected and line 10 not
[01:57:15] <Cork> DarsVaeda: whats the exception?
[01:57:29] <DarsVaeda> exception? there is none
[01:58:01] <Cork> ah expected... looks like i need to learn to read...
[01:58:15] <DarsVaeda> oh okay, no prob
[01:58:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: what is it saying is undefined?
[01:58:37] <Cork> box?
[01:58:44] <DarsVaeda> "$('#section_type').val()"
[01:58:50] <DarsVaeda> sorry I made that not clear enough
[01:58:55] <Cork> unknown function val on undefined?
[01:59:19] <DarsVaeda> no the value is at that point undefined
[01:59:34] <DarsVaeda> there is an object $('#section_type)
[01:59:41] <DarsVaeda> but the length is 0
[02:00:02] <Cork> wait
[02:00:04] <Cork> ready??
[02:00:18] <Cork> .remove().ready(function() { <-- there is no ready there
[02:01:01] <DarsVaeda> can you not put that behind every function to know when it has finished doing stuff with the dom?
[02:01:08] <Cork> no
[02:01:14] <Cork> ready is ONLY for them the page loads
[02:01:23] <Cork> dom isn't async
[02:01:30] <Cork> then your code continues its done
[02:01:51] * DarsVaeda scratches his head
[02:02:00] <Cork> that also means button: $(this), is pointless
[02:02:12] <DarsVaeda> that always worked ^^
[02:02:16] <DarsVaeda> I mean the ready thing
[02:03:28] <Cork> DarsVaeda: .ready is triggered when DOMContentLoaded is fired by the browser, alternative the load event id DOMContentLoaded doesn't exist
[02:03:47] <Cork> and that only fires when the initial html file is parsed
[02:04:06] * DarsVaeda scratches his head again
[02:04:06] <Cork> DarsVaeda: .ready is after that just run instantly
[02:04:19] <Cork> so ya, you might be able to make this changed though it
[02:04:31] <Cork> but its a side effect, but its not my design
[02:04:39] <Cork> *not by design
[02:05:18] <dogmatic69> Anyone have ideas for managing loads of images? like selecting product images in a cart with 2k+ images?
[02:05:33] <DarsVaeda> for example I use jtemplates to generate content on page, then I added click events to elements that are in that generated content
[02:05:36] <Cork> you should do var input = $('<input id="addLinkInput" type="text" name="url">'); $(this).after(input); ... button: input,
[02:05:51] <DarsVaeda> so I ran into problem that those elements where not there when I wanted to add the click event
[02:06:03] <DarsVaeda> it always worked to day to nest that in .ready
[02:06:12] <DarsVaeda> I'm puzzled
[02:06:32] <Cork> well it might work, but its totally wrong for what that function is for
[02:06:41] <DarsVaeda> I see
[02:06:51] <Cork> and its an effect that might goaway in fugure
[02:06:55] <Cork> *future
[02:07:02] <Cork> as its not in anyway intended
[02:07:25] <DarsVaeda> I seeÂ² ... how do you do that properly then?
[02:07:38] <Cork> and honestly, the way your using it; its completely pointless
[02:07:45] <Cork> like i said a few lines up
[02:08:00] <Cork> you should do var input = $('<input id="addLinkInput" type="text" name="url">'); $(this).after(input).remove(); ... button: input,
[02:08:38] <gotwig> hello
[02:08:47] <gianiaz> Cork do you have any experience about extending globalize? I can't understand if it is possible to manage different simbols on a field...
[02:08:58] <gotwig> I have that statement var content = $('#' + id).text(); how do I can also select onl only tags that are 'p' ?
[02:09:11] <Cork> gianiaz: not at all, haven't heard of it before how
[02:09:21] <gotwig> like var content = $('#' + id + 'p').text(); :/?
[02:09:40] <gotwig> I know how to do it in normal javascript, with getelementbytagname...
[02:09:44] <Qdest> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/10/ does it load for you now?
[02:10:00] <Cork> gotwig: you mean $(('#' + id + ' p') ?
[02:10:22] <gotwig> I just want to select all ones that have p as a tag in that :X
[02:10:30] <Cork> Qdest: nope >_>
[02:10:36] <gotwig> and the id
[02:10:51] <gotwig> because with that combo that I initially used, also the button text got included..
[02:11:04] <Cork> so you want all p's and that specific id?
[02:11:09] <Cork> or all p's in that id?
[02:11:27] <gotwig> there is just one p
[02:11:30] <gotwig> so I want that :)
[02:11:34] <gotwig> the content of that
[02:11:42] <Cork> gotwig: so $(('#' + id + ', p') ?
[02:11:44] <gotwig> like, only go one level deeper, into p, then the content
[02:11:47] <Cork> opps
[02:11:50] <Cork> gotwig: so $('#' + id + ', p') ?
[02:12:05] <Cork> gotwig: what?
[02:12:24] <Cork> gotwig: you can't really limit how deep test() will grab into the element
[02:12:32] <Cork> it will grab all text in all its children
[02:12:49] <gotwig> now I somehow get double results xD?
[02:13:02] <Cork> if p is inside the id ya
[02:13:22] <gotwig> now its fine I guess
[02:13:33] <gotwig> hm...
[02:13:55] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, I try to send a ajax request with $.get() with one parameter and cache=false. But why do I url end up looking like /some/url?var=val& =13603123231488785 (which in turn give a 500 error) ?
[02:14:09] <NeedSomeHelp> *my url
[02:14:32] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: &_=loooong-number
[02:14:46] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: its to bypass the browsers cache
[02:14:49] <Cork> its needed
[02:15:04] <Cork> your server have to deal with it if you want to be able to bypass the cache
[02:15:08] <NeedSomeHelp> but it gives me 500 internal server error
[02:15:09] <gotwig> now everything is pretty much messed up :/
[02:15:12] <NeedSomeHelp> in the console
[02:15:22] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: the server need to be updated to allow it
[02:15:25] <gotwig> Cork, http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[02:16:28] <gotwig> Cork, it seems like , p influences every p, I just want the p that is inside the id
[02:16:38] <nFFF> Cork, ok it's returning 0, doesn't (function($){ }(jQuery) wait for the DOM to load? same as document.ready()?
[02:17:01] <gotwig> I just droped the ,
[02:17:03] <gotwig> it works ;D
[02:17:06] <gotwig> ','
[02:17:42] <Cork> Qdest: your hiding in a clone, thats why it fails
[02:18:13] <Cork> Qdest: http://fiddle.jshell.net/jkMgj/11/
[02:18:15] <Qdest> Cork: it seems to be required for quicksand, so perhaps it will work with it?
[02:18:39] <Cork> Qdest: i don't see how it would
[02:19:01] <Qdest> Cork: then I get the picture. It's only 1 thing left and that's if you "select app" then "deselect it" again, how to 'revert back to 'all''?
[02:20:04] <Qdest> Cork: so going from one specific filter, deselecting it so "none" is selected, go back to 'all'?
[02:20:04] <Cork> Qdest: you need to run .show() on all elements before you hide the ones you don't want to show
[02:20:33] <Cork> $data.find('.project').show()
[02:20:52] <nFFF> Cork ?
[02:20:55] <Qdest> Yeah sure but, nevermind the showing/hiding for now that's up to quicksand. It was just for testing purposes I wanted to see if it worked. Basically what I mean is that $filteredItems should match ".project" as in all of them if "nothing" is selected reverting back to "all"
[02:21:21] <Cork> nFFF: no $(function() {}) and $(document).ready(function() {}); waits for dom load
[02:21:35] <Cork> (function($){})(jQuery) is just a variable wrapper
[02:21:44] <Cork> (to ensure that $ is jQuery
[02:21:45] <Cork> )
[02:22:07] <nFFF> ah thought it also waited for the dom to load
[02:22:22] <nFFF> thanks
[02:22:24] <Cork> nope, that would break most plugins actually
[02:22:40] <Cork> you can do jQuery(function($) {}); if you prefer that
[02:23:38] <Qdest> Cork: I need a way to implement a check if "nothing" is active (hasClass active) in the <li>'s, make "all" the active one and set $filteredItems = $data.find('.project');
[02:23:39] <nFFF> Thanks works now
[02:23:49] <nFFF> Fuck what a silly mistake I wasted time on
[02:23:55] <Cork> gotwig: you have things outside both head and body
[02:24:01] <Cork> gotwig: your closing your head to early
[02:24:14] <Cork> Qdest: why?
[02:24:26] <Cork> just reset the filter, you will have to do that anyway
[02:24:30] <dblosevn> just playing with something in my head... would  it be possible to change the zoom level for one component on the page?
[02:24:49] <Cork> dblosevn: in ie and css3 compatible browsers
[02:24:59] <Qdest> Cork: e.g. at line 19. Cause when you enter the page, "all" is selected automatically. If you switch to viewing "apps". Then you "deselect" apps, "all" wont become selected again automatically unless you press 'all'
[02:25:05] <dblosevn> eg... I want to zoom out on a ckeditor so you can actually see the entire table width they are working on
[02:25:06] <gotwig> Cork, outside body?
[02:25:08] <Cork> dblosevn: transform: scale(2); zoom: 2;
[02:25:27] <dblosevn> im only supporting chrome
[02:25:32] <Cork> gotwig: </head> ... <script type='text/javascript' src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery ... <body>
[02:25:49] <Cork> and your page is in quirks mode
[02:25:55] <Cork> you need a doctype
[02:25:58] <gotwig> Cork, I have changed that
[02:25:58] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[02:26:07] <dblosevn> ya its html5
[02:26:23] <Cork> no
[02:26:24] <dblosevn> main reason im only supporting chrome is for webkit
[02:26:28] <Cork> you just removed the <html> tag >_>
[02:26:37] <gotwig> thx
[02:26:56] <gotwig> Cork, no
[02:27:03] <Cork> gotwig: you need the <html> tag
[02:27:11] <Cork> yes: <!doctype html> <head>
[02:27:12] <dblosevn> <!DOCTYPE html><html>
[02:27:36] <dblosevn> or is that redundant?
[02:27:40] <Cork> no
[02:27:49] <Cork> upcase isn't needed though
[02:27:51] <gotwig> dblosevn, you're right I guess...
[02:28:12] <Cork> oh... no NO NOOO
[02:28:18] <Cork> gotwig: are you writing the page in word?
[02:28:25] <dblosevn> lmao
[02:28:26] <Cork> your using microsoft style attrbutes
[02:28:35] <gotwig> Cork, Word doesnt runs fine under Linux...
[02:28:36] <Cork> <div></div class="new_action">
[02:28:50] <Cork> then your page needs to be validated
[02:28:52] <dblosevn> hmm...

[02:29:16] <Cork> gotwig: its invalid
[02:29:17] <dblosevn> thats as bad as some of the data i have been cleaning up </br> for instance
[02:29:39] <Qdest> lmao
[02:29:51] <gotwig> go home :D
[02:30:23] <dblosevn> well actually to make it wore it was stored in the db as &amp;&lt;/br&amp;&gt;
[02:30:34] <dblosevn> -wore + worse
[02:30:40] <gotwig> Attribute rel not allowed on element button at this point.
[02:30:42] <gotwig> lol really?
[02:30:52] <Cork> dblosevn: prob legacy form the xhtml era
[02:31:03] <Qdest> dblosevn: that doesn't make it worse tho, just search for it and remove from all rows and you're done ;p
[02:31:05] <dblosevn> umm /br?
[02:31:12] <Cork> every thing has to be closed, so lets close them and then send them as invalid data
[02:31:18] <dblosevn> thats never been valid since the beginning of time
[02:31:23] <Cork> <br/> == <br></br> == wrong
[02:31:42] <Cork> i've seen loads of parsers cause that
[02:31:54] <Cork> cause ppl write xhtml tags for html
[02:32:21] <dblosevn> well this was a careless russains fault lol i found it hardcoded in a custom nl2br function
[02:32:23] <Qdest> So cork how can I do an "OR" statement on line 19 so that it would 'reset' the filter if there isn't a .active in any of the <li>'s?
[02:32:35] <Qdest> if(currentItem.data('cat') == 'all' || !$('.filter-list li.active') ) { didn't want to work
[02:32:52] <Cork> Qdest: not an or, i've told you how to do it several times
[02:33:17] <Qdest> Really? O.o Must've missed it! Multiple times!
[02:33:57] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/jkMgj/11/
[02:34:18] <Qdest> You told me to reset the filter cause I'd have to do that anyway, but basically "resetting" the filter is done when 'all' is selected which I'd like to happen as well for when nothing is selected :D
[02:34:22] <Cork> if you don't you will slowly hide all elements, as you never reset the old filter
[02:34:46] <Cork> Qdest: no that resets the vissible display of what to filter
[02:34:50] <dblosevn> Qdest: and id like a beer
[02:35:15] <Cork> Qdest: that also means much of the if case code you have is redundant
[02:35:34] <gotwig> that validator is really stupid
[02:36:02] <Cork> gotwig: no its strict, thats the point
[02:36:10] <Cork> it validates that what you write is valid html
[02:36:10] <dblosevn> lol write valid xhtml and it wont be stupid lol
[02:36:26] <Cork> dblosevn: *html not xhtml
[02:36:42] <Cork> xhtml needs to be served with application/xhtml+xml
[02:36:44] <Cork> else its html
[02:37:12] <gotwig> whats an alternative for rel on a <button> tag o.0?
[02:37:16] <Qdest> Cork: Well, don't mind the showing/hiding at the moment. That's up to Quicksand to handle. I just need to make sure $filteredItems is correct. And it is if I select 'all', it then has all .project in the selection. I wish for this even if "nothing" of the <li> hasClass('active') as well so it would select 'all' .project. Or, am I misunderstanding again? :p
[02:37:24] <Cork> gotwig: todo what?
[02:37:41] <dblosevn> gotwig <button data-your-data="value" >
[02:38:09] <gotwig> I'm loving it...
[02:38:43] <dblosevn> then you can do $(this.data('your-data') to pull it in handlers
[02:39:02] <dblosevn> -. +).
[02:39:36] <gotwig> data-your-data lol?
[02:39:36] <dblosevn> fingers arent working its like 3 degress outside lmao
[02:39:50] <dblosevn> where your-data is the name of the field
[02:39:58] <dblosevn> data-product-id="1"
[02:39:59] <gotwig> like data-id="AWESOMSAUCE" ?
[02:40:01] <Cork> gotwig: data- is a prefix, after it you're allowed to add any attribute name you want
[02:40:23] <Cork> its a namespace reserved in spec for the website developer
[02:40:58] <dblosevn> you can even write selectors to match on it
[02:41:12] <Cork> it won't ever have any meaning to the browser so its safe to use
[02:41:44] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/WpJxn/5/ Is there a way to get this to count up in random blocks, rather than just 1,2,3. Also It "restarts" every time you run. I want to count up to a random stupidly high number in random blocks, like the google quota on gmail
[02:41:51] <Cork> dblosevn: though if you regularly need to select on it you should be using a class
[02:42:08] <dblosevn> ya, very true

[02:42:28] <xhoy> fRAiLtY-: cant you borrow the code from google?

[02:44:10] <Cork> aaaand i think i killed it
[02:44:12] <dblosevn> does he have jquery loaded? lol
[02:44:20] <Cork> it doens't have a dom
[02:44:37] <dblosevn> I know i was totally being silly
[02:44:48] <Cork> dblosevn: not as silly as you think
[02:44:51] <Cork> it did once
[02:44:54] <Qdest> Cork: I can't seem to check whether anything has .active and do stuff based on it. What I want is if nothing has .active, set .active on .all-projects and set $filteredItems = $data.find('.project'); - No idea how to though, don't seem like I can do that on .click()
[02:45:26] <Cork> Qdest: i don't get at all what you're trying to do honestly...
[02:45:58] <Qdest> Cork: http://fiddle.jshell.net/jkMgj/11/ <-- all is selected when entering the Fiddle. Now hit "App". App is now selected. Now hit App again.
[02:46:12] <Qdest> Problem is, "All" doesn't get selected when nothing else is.
[02:46:27] <Qdest> The hiding/showing of the div elements below doesn't matter atm, ignore the .hide()
[02:46:44] <Cork> Qdest: ya, cause you never reset the filtered elements
[02:46:51] <Cork> like i've already said...
[02:46:58] <dblosevn> :-)
[02:47:03] <Cork> *sigh*
[02:47:17] <Qdest> Cork: I know you've said so, but I do if you hit 'all'? $filteredItems then contains all .project?
[02:47:26] <dblosevn> about that beer lol
[02:47:33] <Cork> no you just make sure you select all elements
[02:47:41] <Cork> you never show anything again
[02:48:07] <Qdest> no, I don't have to.. as long as all elements are selected again (that's a reset in my mind) i'm ok. However this doesn't happen if "nothing" is selected - which is what I want
[02:48:41] <gotwig> Cork, what is that?  Line 128, Column 48: & did not start a character reference. (& probably should have been escaped as &amp;.)
[02:48:58] <Cork> gotwig: you want &amp;
[02:49:03] <dblosevn> Well going back to my earlier question, about setting the zoom on an element, can I somehow make it auto fit by width?
[02:49:06] <Cork> &amp; is the escaped form of &
[02:49:24] <gotwig> Cork, so noone can do bad concatation :X?
[02:49:27] <Cork> dblosevn: don't think so
[02:49:58] <dblosevn> :-( I dont really care about the height but id like the width of the table to be visible
[02:50:12] <Cork> gotwig: its not about if it can be fixed or not
[02:50:26] <Cork> browsers do, the problem is, you don't want to count on it
[02:51:25] <dblosevn> ya browsers can improperly detect the & in urls as entities and that reaks havoc
[02:52:00] <dblosevn> always better to entity encode url parameters and the usuage of the & in the body
[02:52:14] <Cork> ya, like ?key=value&aring;input=10 *opps*
[02:53:14] <gotwig> Cork, 2 errors and 1 warning remaining  :> I'm g2g :O

[03:01:40] <dblosevn> Cork: doesnt .text strip the html?
[03:01:45] <Cork> yes
[03:01:48] <Cork> so?
[03:02:18] <dblosevn> oh i would assume if hes using contentEditable he wants it to be html otherwise why not use a textarea?
[03:02:22] <the_dark_knight> Cork: but after the edit, is there a save button, so that I can call my jquery's custom method on it.
[03:04:06] <dblosevn> oh i see hes building a plugin like editable
[03:04:55] <the_dark_knight> dblosevn: yes. like mysql's table, but with every field editable.
[03:05:02] <Cork> the_dark_knight: no, contentEditable is just a core component, all the saving and updating you have to do your self
[03:05:44] <dblosevn> why not just use jeditable on the html table and attach to the listners to writeback to mysql?

[03:09:45] <the_dark_knight> How do I integrate this with my codeIgniter?
[03:10:07] <dblosevn> I absolutely hate CI so I really dont have aa clue
[03:10:34] <the_dark_knight> Cork: how do I put this jeditable into my codeIgniter?
[03:10:48] <g0rd0n> i used to do $("#radio").append('<input type="radio" id="radio'+i+'" name="radio" value="'+value+'"\/><label for="radio'+i+'">'+value+'<\/label>'); and then $("#radio").buttonset('refresh'); which worked fine with jqueryui 1.9, but since 1.10 it does not work correctly anymore :( how can i fix this?
[03:11:06] <g0rd0n> basically now i see readio buttons instead of the rendered jqueryui buttonset
[03:12:55] <dblosevn> g0rd0n: does $('#radio').buttonset('destroy').buttonset(); work? also are you getting any errors in the console?
[03:13:43] <g0rd0n> no errors, but let me try your thing
[03:14:20] <dblosevn> thas not the solution ut just a step to debug, if it doesnt work there my be something wrong with your markup
[03:14:25] <g0rd0n> dblosevn: works, thanks :)
[03:14:28] <Cork> the_dark_knight: not sure haven't used jeditable, so... /me looks at dblosevn
[03:14:56] <dblosevn> jeditable is easy, i just dont know where to put files and how to write the controllers etc for CI
[03:15:26] <grafi> controllers go in the controllers folder
[03:15:27] <grafi> xD
[03:15:35] <dblosevn> lol i would assume lol
[03:15:52] <grafi> could be wrong though
[03:16:02] <dblosevn> but if i remmeber correctly CI has more then one controllers folder
[03:16:14] <grafi> thats not possible

[03:17:37] <dblosevn> ?
[03:17:43] <dblosevn> sorry the same callback?
[03:18:27] <dblosevn> $(selector).on('click mousedown', function () {//dosomething });
[03:18:39] <grafi> seems there is only one controllers folder dblosevn, mystery solved
[03:18:49] <dblosevn> it was 2 of something lmao
[03:18:52] <grafi> i wonder why the CI slogan isnt "get baked"
[03:19:11] <adac> dblosevn, thanks! darn I had a "," in between
[03:19:30] <dblosevn> ya its '
[03:19:37] <dblosevn> 'event event event'
[03:19:53] <dblosevn> , is for selectors
[03:19:55] <Cork> dblosevn: depends what you use for your stirng chars >_>
[03:20:10] <Cork> "evnet evetn event" works just as well :)
[03:20:22] <grafi> O_O
[03:20:23] <Cork> ... except for the typos >_>
[03:20:41] <dblosevn> lol the console hates me ^.^
[03:20:50] <grafi> "click click click"
[03:21:04] <dblosevn> the dom hates you @ grafi
[03:21:07] <Cork> heh that would be one pointless event listener :)
[03:21:08] <grafi> does that triple everything?
[03:21:24] <grafi> its mutual dblosevn
[03:21:27] <Cork> unless jquery removes duplicates; and it don't think it does
[03:21:33] <dblosevn> ya unless you e.stopPropagation
[03:21:43] <Cork> no propagatino has nothing to do with it
[03:21:50] <Cork> ...
[03:21:55] <Cork> propagation! T_T
[03:22:08] <dblosevn> very true return false?
[03:22:16] <benjick> Hi. I have a site with a lot of small "boxes" (divs 200x100px). How would I do to when i click them they become bigger and "push" the other boxes away?
[03:22:18] <Cork> eeh
[03:22:27] <Cork> dblosevn: ya, but its pointless to start with
[03:22:46] <dblosevn> unless your building an alert bomb lol
[03:22:47] <Cork> you could use preventDefault() and isDefaultPrevented()
[03:22:51] <thisboy> hey can someone offer me some clues on why this page crashes on mobile? http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/
[03:22:59] * Cork checks the last value
[03:23:30] <Cork> ha, i remembered correct :)
[03:23:48] <dblosevn> thisboy: which devices?
[03:23:51] <grafi> your memory palace remains intact ._.
[03:24:15] <thisboy> dblosevn: the one im on here is a huawei with android and applewebkit
[03:24:16] <grafi> thats a scary looking kid...
[03:25:22] <thisboy> dblosevn: does it work over there?
[03:25:38] <grafi> works fine for me
[03:25:42] <thisboy> hmm
[03:25:55] <grafi> at least my phone hasnt exploded yet
[03:25:57] <thisboy> its using http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ which should be mobile friendly
[03:26:00] <thisboy> haha
[03:26:08] <thisboy> yeah.. weird
[03:26:28] <thisboy> my browser just crashes
[03:26:29] <benjick> thisboy: isotope looks like masonry on steroids
[03:26:36] <thisboy> benjick: it is :D
[03:26:38] <thisboy> hehe
[03:26:49] <benjick> oh, it's using masonry
[03:26:49] <benjick> cool
[03:26:50] <dblosevn> works great on ipad
[03:26:54] <thisboy> i just needed random shuffling so i figured it was the right thing to do
[03:26:58] <thisboy> cool dblosevn
[03:27:00] <dblosevn> and android ics
[03:27:08] <thisboy> yeah my huawei crashes wiether its isotope or masonry though

[03:36:27] <dblosevn> imagine that lmao
[03:36:40] <Cork> bot-t: ?g jquery plugin virtual tour
[03:36:44] <Cork> bah
[03:36:46] <bot-t> Cork, (expando related problem on removeData()) - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 5 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1675
[03:36:49] <Cork> oh
[03:36:52] <dblosevn> lmao
[03:37:05] <dblosevn> ?english @ bot-t
[03:37:06] <bot-t> bot-t, Ingles por favor English Please Anglais s'il vous plait Englisch bitte..
[03:37:55] <dblosevn> its in there forgot what its called remote resources i think
[03:37:56] <Rufus> reading. Thanks dblosevn
[03:38:20] <dblosevn> b-ot really needs to quite listning to ? g
[03:38:25] <dblosevn> -e
[03:39:18] <Cork> dblosevn: actually i would prefer if it just checked if bot-t is around
[03:39:29] <dblosevn> ++
[03:40:15] <dblosevn> or if they PRIVMSG'd each other every once in a while to see if they were responding
[03:40:59] <Cork> no, thats much more risky
[03:41:09] <Cork> that could get them kicked for flooding
[03:41:18] <Cork> (if a script fails)
[03:41:32] <dblosevn> like /msg ?echo @ bot-t are you alive every 20 minutes or so
[03:42:29] * Cork foresees bot-t hanging and b-t getting kicked for queue exceeding...
[03:42:46] <g0rd0n> oh great, yet another problem... in my .tabs, i have select: function(event, ui) { window.location.hash = ui.tab.hash; }, which worked fine until jqueryui 1.9, does not work with 1.10 though :( what that is supposed to do is change the #hash in the url when klicking on the tabs
[03:42:52] <dblosevn> hmm if the interval was that high?
[03:43:12] <pallet> Hi all
[03:43:16] <Cork> dblosevn: its the fact that you depend on things getting sent over the irc server
[03:43:20] <pallet> does anyone here use jTables ?
[03:43:25] <Cork> dblosevn: and i did say the script fails
[03:43:55] <Cork> dblosevn: i've run a few bots my self so i know how easy it is for that to happen
[03:44:24] <dblosevn> ya, if b-ot doesnt recieve the echo back it starts listening to ?g etc
[03:44:43] <Cork> much better if it just checks if bot-t is marked as in the channel
[03:45:09] <dblosevn> but bot-t sometimes gets stuck in the list for hours even if it isnt responding
[03:45:26] <dblosevn> and vise versa
[03:45:30] <Cork> yes, but its better then both bots going down
[03:45:40] <dblosevn> true
[03:47:04] <dblosevn> oh and the_dark_knight its Add Resources in jsfiddle
[03:48:48] <g0rd0n> damn it looks like ALL the options i use were removed: select, cache, spinner, ajaxOptions
[03:48:52] <g0rd0n> how great is that
[03:49:39] <pythonsnake> hi
[03:49:48] <pythonsnake>     <option value="sydneyBranch">Sydney</option>
[03:50:00] <pythonsnake> how do I get sydney with $(this)?
[03:50:03] <pythonsnake> .text()?
[03:50:10] <Cork> what is this?
[03:50:11] <StPiere> im using ui combobox plugin ... is there a way to check if combobox is already initialized on some element ??
[03:50:11] <dblosevn> ya im thinking about how to implement hash tags for navaigation in my current app
[03:50:13] <Cork> the select box?
[03:50:27] <pythonsnake> Cork: yep
[03:50:51] <Cork> $(this).find('option[value="sydneyBranch"]').text()
[03:51:07] <pythonsnake> thanks

[03:51:15] <pythonsnake> is this neat code?

[03:51:43] <StPiere> thanks .. im gonna check those links
[03:51:46] <Cork> pythonsnake: $(this).find('option[value="' + $(this).val() + '"]').text()
[03:51:47] <Adamantus> I'm trying to find out about the jqeury prototype function (not to be confused with the prototype js framework.) Trouble is I can only find info on the framework not the jquery function.
[03:51:49] <dblosevn> the first one
[03:52:13] <pythonsnake> Cork: just text :D
[03:52:34] <Adamantus> Actually I think it's a property.
[03:52:40] <Cork> pythonirc101: i don't think you can use text on the select element to get the text of the option
[03:52:40] <pythonirc101> Cork: I am a log bot
[03:52:51] <Cork> bah
[03:53:05] <Cork> pythonsnake: btw location is a SCARY variable, i would rename that one
[03:53:17] <Cork> window.location = value would reload the page :)
[03:53:31] <Cork> and so would location = value
[03:54:21] <dblosevn> delete(location) lol even scaryier
[03:54:32] <Cork> don't think you can actually
[03:54:41] <Cork> that would just restore it to the browser default object
[03:54:41] <dblosevn> probally not
[03:54:57] <dblosevn> or crash the browser one lol
[03:55:02] <Cork> no
[03:55:06] <pythonsnake> Cork: thanks
[03:55:37] <dblosevn> oh it returns false
[03:55:40] <pythonsnake> oh wait
[03:55:44] <pythonsnake>   Cork | pythonirc101: i don't think you can use text on the select element to get the text of the option
[03:55:45] <pythonsnake> then how
[03:56:50] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/196684/jquery-get-specific-option-tag-text
[03:57:00] <dblosevn> looks like you can
[03:57:57] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: i need to use $(this)
[03:58:22] <fRAiLtY-> Need to make this not start from 0 on refresh: http://jsfiddle.net/9mCp8/9/
[03:58:50] <dblosevn> reguardless of how you target the option, .text() will work
[03:59:02] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: $(this).text()?
[03:59:23] <dblosevn> thought cork gave you something different earlier
[04:00:20] <pythonsnake> $(this).find('option[value="sydneyBranch"]').text()
[04:00:31] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: <Cork> $(this).find('option[value="' + $(this).val() + '"]').text()
[04:01:33] <dblosevn> if `this` is the option then $(this).text would work
[04:01:37] <pythonsnake> $('#d_' + $(this).find('option[value="'+$(this).val()+'"]').text()).show();
[04:01:39] <pythonsnake> yeah
[04:01:40] <dblosevn> ()
[04:01:41] <pythonsnake> that
[04:01:56] <dblosevn> um
[04:01:59] <dblosevn> that wont work
[04:02:08] <dblosevn> oh ya it will
[04:02:16] <dblosevn> but god id never put that in production
[04:02:20] <dblosevn> :-)
[04:04:23] <dblosevn> is `this` a select element?
[04:04:55] <dblosevn> @ pythonsnake
[04:06:17] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: yes
[04:08:20] <dblosevn> this is a little cleaner but still dirty lol $('#id_' + $("option:selected", this).text()).show();
[04:09:35] <dblosevn> not quite as blinding anyways
[04:10:48] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: how do i show text according to the selected value then
[04:11:30] <pallet> I'm using http://www.jtable.org/ and it's really cool, but I'm struggling with some parts, does anyone use it know of it or anythning about it ?
[04:11:41] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: $("option:selected", this).text() will give you the text of the selected element if `this` is a select element
[04:12:57] <dblosevn> What I was saying was dirty is relying on the text of an option to target an id, not necessarily as much as the method of getting the text
[04:13:57] <dblosevn> me personally I would set the value of the option to the div id so you can do something like $('#' + this.value).show()
[04:15:03] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: value is very long
[04:15:30] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: come again
[04:15:45] <dblosevn> unless you need a value
[04:16:05] <dblosevn> as well as the text
[04:16:29] <ravenzz> pythonsnake what are you trying to do?
[04:17:07] <dblosevn> sounds like hes trying to show a div with the id #d_ + selected option text
[04:17:20] <ravenzz> what a bad idea
[04:17:29] <dblosevn> my thought exactly
[04:18:45] <dblosevn> just wondering if hes thought about the options text having spaces in them, that will break the hell out of the selector
[04:19:27] <dblosevn> eg <option>Orlando Airport</option>
[04:19:51] <g0rd0n> window.location.hash = ui.newTab.hash <- tried to port my functionality to jqueryui 1.10, but ui.newTab.hash always gives me #undefined... :(
[04:19:52] <dblosevn> would generate the id $('#d_Orlando Airport')
[04:20:08] <pythonsnake> ravenzz: show text
[04:20:11] <pythonsnake>  according to the selected value then
[04:20:30] <dblosevn> which would look for an element with an id of Orlando and and element named Airport
[04:20:54] <ravenzz> pythonsnake you could use a data- attribute
[04:21:00] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: thats easy
[04:21:02] <pythonsnake> how
[04:21:03] <fRAiLtY-> Need to make this not start from 0 on refresh: http://jsfiddle.net/9mCp8/9/
[04:21:12] <g0rd0n> aah.... "The tab property is now newTab and refers to the list item instead of the anchor. "  AHHHHHH
[04:21:14] <g0rd0n> this doesnt wstopo
[04:21:15] <g0rd0n> Q§hta4+q9zghs
[04:21:15] <g0rd0n> #pßrtkuj
[04:21:16] <g0rd0n> i+pöt7zjzghs<
[04:21:27] <dblosevn> $('#output').html($('option:selected', this).text());
[04:21:41] <pythonsnake> what is it
[04:21:59] <ravenzz> <p data-text-id="foo1">foo 1</p>  and <option value="foo1">Select foo1</option>
[04:22:02] <g0rd0n> how do i get the anchor of my tab?
[04:22:13] <ravenzz> so the option value match the data-text-id
[04:22:19] <dblosevn> would put the text of the selected option in an element called output
[04:22:39] <ravenzz> or just an id?
[04:23:44] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: not dynamic?
[04:23:49] <pythonsnake> ravenzz: that's all?
[04:23:49] <niels__> im using the jquery validation plugin, it works great with remote and ajax, but instead of just displaying the error message, how do i fire a function whenever that validation fails?
[04:23:51] <dblosevn> why not?
[04:24:09] <ravenzz> ^
[04:24:47] <dblosevn> option:selected, this changes everytime an option is selected if your listening to the selects change event...
[04:25:23] <pythonsnake> so data- or output thingy?
[04:25:34] <dblosevn> depends on what your trying to do
[04:25:39] <ravenzz> actually $('select').on('change', function () { $(this).val(); });
[04:25:51] <ravenzz> returns you the current selected option value
[04:26:03] <dblosevn> if your just trying to display the text in the options node somewhere theres no need for a data- attribute
[04:26:42] <pythonsnake> I just wanna add a description for each option
[04:26:56] <dblosevn> however if your trying to display an element based on the option thats selected a data-attrib is the way to go
[04:27:05] <pythonsnake> data- then
[04:29:07] <pythonsnake> <div data-text-id="1">test</div>
[04:29:24] <pythonsnake> <option value="1">hi</option>
[04:29:33] <pythonsnake> test still shows even if hi is not selected
[04:31:55] <rmb> why do my code loop the same record from mysql? not only the new thing is added.. jsfiddle.net/uSNsY
[04:32:18] <pythonsnake> rmb: ^
[04:32:22] <pythonsnake> ravenzz: ^*
[04:33:21] <ravenzz> pythonsnake can you create a testcase? on jsfiddle.net jsbin.com ?

[04:36:12] <niels__> im using the jquery validation plugin, it works great with remote and ajax, but instead of just displaying the error message, how do i fire an alert() whenever that remote validation fails?

[04:38:03] <dblosevn> grafi: everything is broken on ff
[04:38:05] <pythonsnake> lemme try
[04:38:16] <grafi> is it?
[04:38:26] <grafi> has only been broken a few days ... sooo
[04:38:31] <dblosevn> lol i gave up on ff over a year ago used to be my fav browser
[04:38:40] <grafi> and now you use chrome?
[04:38:52] <nFFF> I want to toggle a margin-left on click, any easy (1 line of code) way to do this?
[04:39:05] <dblosevn> its gotten progressively slower and the crashes have become more frequent and the memory usuage is off the charts
[04:39:08] <dblosevn> ++chrome
[04:39:12] <nFFF> left.animate({width:'toggle'},350); similiar to this
[04:39:52] <grafi> na memory usage got better ;) i just cant bring myself to make the switch
[04:40:02] <grafi> so im stuck with what im used to ^^
[04:40:19] <dblosevn> the chrome inspector is so much nicer after about a weke
[04:40:23] <dblosevn> *week
[04:40:55] <masak> I'm looking around in jQuery UI, but not finding what I'm looking for right away, so I'll ask: is there an established technique for "make this div show up near a button/link that was just clicked"?
[04:41:02] <dblosevn> nFF: the margin-left always the same value
[04:41:04] <dblosevn> ?
[04:41:21] <masak> sort of like jQuery UI Datepicker does it.
[04:41:23] <dblosevn> if so create a class with the margin-left and
[04:41:24] <pythonsnake> oh wiat
[04:41:35] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: can data-id be changed

[04:42:13] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: yes
[04:42:19] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: by value?
[04:42:44] <dblosevn> i hhave no clue what you mean
[04:43:04] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: <option value="#d_buffalo">Water Buffalos</option>
[04:43:22] <dblosevn> I showed you an example that has no chance of breaking if theres invalid characters in the option text
[04:43:33] <dblosevn> hmm
[04:43:40] <dblosevn> pretty sure I didnt write that lol
[04:43:48] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: yeah
[04:43:51] <pythonsnake> <option data-id="#d_buffalo">Water Buffalos</option>
[04:43:55] <pythonsnake> change it to something like
[04:43:58] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: <option value="#d_buffalo">Water Buffalos</option>
[04:44:16] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: <option data-id="#d_buffalo" value="1">Water Buffalos</option>
[04:44:27] <dblosevn> you can set the value to whatever you wish
[04:44:41] <dblosevn> im using the data- param to show the proper div
[04:45:00] <dblosevn> the value is irrelavant in my example
[04:45:21] <pythonsnake> no i mean
[04:45:28] <pythonsnake> I have to use value
[04:45:30] <pythonsnake> not data-id
[04:46:10] <dblosevn> with a little tweaking that could be done, keep in mind though value can only have a-z0-9-_ in it
[04:46:30] <dblosevn> if theres spaces or highbit chars it will be invalid
[04:46:44] <dblosevn> value also has to be unique
[04:48:09] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: yes
[04:48:35] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: http://jsfiddle.net/hdabf/2/
[04:48:37] <AdamPDotty> what about the # ?
[04:49:36] <dblosevn> AdamPDotty: what about it lol I just put the whole selector in my data- param
[04:50:23] <dblosevn> Oh I see what you mean, being hes using the option value in a selector he can only use chars valid in a selector
[04:50:47] <dblosevn> in this case valid for an element id
[04:51:04] <AdamPDotty> might get confusing
[04:51:09] <AdamPDotty> and thats my job
[04:51:20] <dblosevn> i thought so too, i like my implementation better
[04:51:46] <dblosevn> using data- instead of value so the option can have a value and a clean se;ectpr
[04:51:51] <dblosevn> *selector
[04:53:04] <pythonsnake> why # D:
[04:53:25] <dblosevn> ?
[04:54:00] <dblosevn> you mean why #d_ ?
[04:54:21] <dblosevn> I just prefixed it to help avoid a collision with another element in the dom
[04:54:22] <pythonsnake> yes
[04:55:07] <dblosevn> me personally i would have enumerated them
[04:56:15] <pythonsnake> i have links there dblosevn
[04:57:02] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: http://jsfiddle.net/hdabf/5/
[04:58:01] <dblosevn> that way you dont have to worry about sanitizing the stirng before injecting the value into the markup
[04:58:30] <mikl> hmm, once upon a time, there was an experimental date picker for jQuery Mobile: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/experiments/ui-datepicker/ - does anyone know of one compatible with jQMo 1.3?
[04:59:42] <dblosevn> mikl: doesnt <input type="date" /> use the device datepicker?
[05:00:18] <mikl> dblosevn: hmm, good question. I wonder how standardised the output from that is...
[05:00:56] <dblosevn> pretty sure you can specify the format
[05:01:05] <pythonsnake> i have links in value there dblosevn
[05:01:08] <dblosevn> probally returns a js Date object
[05:01:10] <pythonsnake> urls
[05:01:33] <dblosevn> or a vlue you can make a Date object with
[05:02:14] <dblosevn> pythonsnake
[05:02:32] <dblosevn> if you have urls in the value field youll have to use data- attribs
[05:03:11] <Antiga> There's more than one date type in HTML5 sheet. date, datetime, datetime-local, month, week, time. So, you can do some of your parsing at that level.
[05:03:39] <Antiga> I believe "date" is the most standardized right now, though.
[05:04:03] <dblosevn> i like the prospect of using the native date picker over making one for a mobile device as they are already used to it
[05:04:15] <pythonsnake> hmm
[05:06:33] <pythonsnake> ok thanks
[05:06:58] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: anyways im about at the point somebody will shoot me if i dont get back to work, I have given you 3 different examples of how to solve your problem, the only thing left for you to do is to pick one that suits your needs :-)
[05:09:25] <Krambiorix> hi , i have a class like class="test 8938799879"  how do i get my id out of the class?
[05:11:12] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: just for kicks heres one that enumerates the data- attribs and uses urls for the value http://jsfiddle.net/hdabf/7/
[05:12:00] <niels__> Could anyone help me out with this? Open modal when jQuery validation remote fails: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14773262/open-modal-when-jquery-validation-remote-fails
[05:13:29] <Nebros> how i have to change this code http://bpaste.net/show/AtI1efnhziLq9S357Qtq/ when i will have the given value back into the option list with alternating colors?
[05:15:45] <dblosevn> Krambiorix: thats not a valid class, classes cant have spaces in them
[05:17:05] <dblosevn> id use data for that <div data-id="8938799879" class="test"> then you could do something like $('.test').click(function(){console.log($(this).data('id'));});
[05:23:01] <dblosevn> Nebros: var color1 = '#fff', color2 = '#000'; var mOpt = $(option).clone().css('color', (loop %2 == 1) ? color1 : color2); this.selectobj.options[index++] = mOpt;
[05:23:56] <booom> dudes anybody here used or using openlayers.js?
[05:24:11] <booom> i have a really stupid question but i'm not getting any support from #openalyers
[05:24:21] <dblosevn> Nebros: untested but its at least close to right
[05:24:28] <Nebros> thx dblosevn i try it
[05:25:56] <talktokets> How can we give transition effects to butttons and view them in android mobile ?
[05:26:05] <dblosevn> Nebros: sorry dont use loop %2 use index %2
[05:26:20] <g0rd0n> how do i get the anchor name of the selected tab (newTab) in beforeActivate ?
[05:26:47] <dblosevn> hmm
[05:28:04] <dblosevn> g0rd0n: should be buried in the ui object
[05:28:24] <Krambiorix> dblosevn, in steado of data-id , can you do also data-foo ?
[05:28:34] <nathanb> is there a good autocomplete libary for jquery-mobile ?
[05:28:34] <Krambiorix> or does it just work with -id
[05:28:42] <dblosevn> g0rd0n: console.log(ui); inside of beforeActivate
[05:29:01] <g0rd0n> dblosevn: ok thanks ill try that and see what it spits out
[05:29:29] <dblosevn> it could be data-a-super-long-string-nobody-ever-would-use-in-there-life if you wanted it to be just make sure to request the right attrib with .data
[05:29:50] <gotwig> how can I do nice inline textediting of just a single line, the name of the grid?
[05:29:51] <gotwig> http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[05:30:03] <gotwig> Thats finished with like enter..
[05:30:55] <dblosevn> gotwig: i usually use jeditable for easy stuff like that
[05:31:18] <dblosevn> can accomplish it with a couple lines of js and a couple on the backend
[05:31:31] <gotwig> dblosevn, I already use contenteditable
[05:31:45] <gotwig> I dont know how to do it with a simple line, tough... without a button
[05:31:48] <overrider> i have these kind of times on my site: <p class="time">13:29:36</p>, and i would like that when the page finished loading, those times start to run as normal, eg increment one second every second. Does anyone know a plugin that could do this, or what would be a good search term?
[05:32:19] <dblosevn> I saw that, but jeditable already implments the server sided stuff, using contentEditable youll have to do all that on your own
[05:32:45] <gotwig> dblosevn, hm, ddo you know of something like $(".save").click(function (e) {	?
[05:32:48] <dblosevn> *not serversided, the ajax posts
[05:33:02] <gotwig> *just for textchange
[05:33:16] <mvta> hey, I have one stupid question: why is not related .data() with html5 data-* ?
[05:33:26] <gotwig> when i want to use jeditable, I have to rewrite stuff again :X
[05:33:47] <dblosevn> youd need to bind a keydown or keypress listener to the contentEditable field and listen for the enter key then post the contents of the div to the server for processing
[05:34:13] <dblosevn> dude $('#div_id').jeditable() how much simpler can it be?
[05:34:42] <talktokets> the effects of transitions is not visible on chrome ? what to do? can anyone help?
[05:34:56] <gotwig> jeditabble looks  fine...
[05:35:39] <dblosevn> mvta: no clue what your talking about lol .data pulls in the data- attribs
[05:35:57] <uGoMobi> talktokets: can you be a bit more specific?
[05:36:11] <talktokets> I am developing a mobile app
[05:36:12] <uGoMobi> talktokets: do you mean page transition
[05:36:18] <talktokets> yes
[05:36:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:36:28] <g0rd0n> dblosevn: i see it is in newTab -> context -> attributes -> 0 (or "title")... how do i access that=
[05:36:39] <uGoMobi> talktokets: what OS are you testing on?
[05:36:40] <mvta> dblosevn, ?
[05:36:56] <talktokets> so in that i m using page transition. in android mobile its not working
[05:37:05] <talktokets> and sometimes on chrome+windows
[05:37:10] <uGoMobi> talktokets: what Android version?
[05:37:18] <talktokets> 2.3.6
[05:37:38] <gotwig> dblosevn, and how is save.php built..?
[05:38:11] <uGoMobi> talktokets: see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[05:38:15] <dblosevn> mvta: <div data-product="10" class="product" /> $('.product').click(function() { alert($(this).data('product')); });
[05:38:33] <uGoMobi> talktokets: Only seeing fade transitions? To view all transition types, you must be on a browser that supports 3D transforms. By default, devices that lack 3D support (such as Android 2.x) will fallback to "fade" for all transition types.... etc etc
[05:38:36] <dblosevn> would alert 10 when you click on a product
[05:39:09] <talktokets> yeah actually its displaying only fade transition
[05:39:11] <talktokets> correct
[05:39:21] <dblosevn> gotwig: id=elements_id&value=user_edited_content
[05:39:32] <uGoMobi> talktokets: you can override it but that's on own risk
[05:39:51] <talktokets> how to do that? can u tell me?
[05:39:51] <uGoMobi> talktokets: we disable it on Android 2.3 because transitions often look bad there
[05:39:57] <uGoMobi> sure
[05:40:08] <uGoMobi> one sec
[05:40:11] <dblosevn> gotwig: its posted to the server though so in php, $field = $_POST['id']; $value = $_POST['value'];
[05:40:22] <talktokets> ok
[05:41:44] <gotwig> dblosevn, yeah, I know that.. but it still looks a bit complex to me..
[05:41:51] <gotwig> all that dynamic stuff :(
[05:42:15] <gotwig> e.g how can I implement "click me if you dare!"? from here? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html
[05:42:23] <dblosevn> what lol, with input sanitation and everything i could write the whole thing both clientside and server side in about 10 lines of code.
[05:43:56] <beasty> mm
[05:44:02] <dblosevn> gotwig: just add a class to all elements you want editable, set a unique id for each element and $('.classname').jeditable('save.php');
[05:44:28] <dblosevn> simple as that on the client side
[05:44:49] <gotwig> alright, and on save.php, just get the stuff with POST
[05:44:57] <gotwig> and then make e.g a mysql query :X?
[05:45:00] <dblosevn> yep id and value
[05:46:10] <uGoMobi> talktokets: http://jsbin.com/erezak/15/edit
[05:46:25] <uGoMobi> talktokets: see the script in the <head>
[05:46:34] <talktokets> yeah sure
[05:46:39] <talktokets> looking at it
[05:46:45] <uGoMobi> talktokets: this is example for slide transition
[05:46:56] <talktokets> ok
[05:47:10] <dblosevn> gotwig: if you need a rowid as well make the url for it $('.classname').jeditable('save.php?rowid=1'); where 1 is the reow id
[05:47:15] <beasty> hi guys
[05:47:25] <beasty> i have this mobile app that send data towards a webserver
[05:47:32] <beasty> but what should i use to post data from it ?
[05:47:35] <StPiere> does this work in all browser: $('input[type=file]:first').trigger('click')
[05:47:37] <uGoMobi> talktokets: if you use another transition, change or add $.mobile.transitionFallbacks.[transitionName] = "[transitionName]"
[05:47:44] <StPiere> i want to open file dialog dynamicaly
[05:47:59] <Nebros> dblosevn im to bad to use your code correct. i made always errors. ^^ i have made here a better codelink and put your codepart to the top. can you please put it into the correct place and delete the unused part? ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/JBNRj/
[05:48:01] <StPiere> because it's opacity is 0 - design reasons
[05:48:06] <talktokets> so where to add that ? in the <head> of page?
[05:48:10] <pythonsnake> dblosevn: ping
[05:48:22] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: pong
[05:48:34] <uGoMobi> talktokets: in the <head> and before you load jquery.mobile.js
[05:49:03] <uGoMobi> talktokets: exactly where I put it in that JS Bin
[05:49:09] <talktokets> ok thanks. I will try and will ask if needed :)
[05:49:13] <pythonsnake> http://jsfiddle.net/zKW8q/ dblosevn
[05:49:19] <pythonsnake> what's wrong with it
[05:49:24] <uGoMobi> talktokets: ok, good luck
[05:49:43] <talktokets> uGoMobi: thanks
[05:49:56] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: ids have to start with a letter
[05:50:03] <pythonsnake> ok
[05:50:10] <pythonsnake> abc then
[05:51:48] <gotwig> dblosevn, do  need the contenteditable thing anymore?
[05:52:50] <pythonsnake> dblosevn:

[05:54:00] <gotwig> dblosevn, http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php what is wrong :O? http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php

[05:55:14] <pythonsnake> dblosevn:
[05:55:16] <pythonsnake> id is data-id?
[05:55:20] <dblosevn> yes
[05:55:35] <gotwig> dblosevn, I loaded the script before jQuery
[05:55:45] <gotwig> now it works
[05:55:50] <dblosevn> :-)
[05:56:30] <gotwig> how is echo.php built?
[05:56:41] <dblosevn> ?
[05:57:30] <gotwig> .click uses echo.php
[05:57:33] <gotwig> not the normal save.php
[05:57:34] <gotwig> :(
[05:57:41] <Pimpollo> The best jerkoffs? JizzDay
[05:57:47] <dblosevn> I would build an echo like header('Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf8'); echo json_encode($_REQUEST); exit;
[05:58:49] <gotwig> my file looks like that.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[05:58:52] <gotwig> oups
[05:59:14] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1624718/
[05:59:45] <gotwig> dblosevn, why doesnt it just use save.php :/?
[05:59:58] <dblosevn> gotwig: it appears you still have contentEditable on the div
[06:00:08] <gotwig> dblosevn, so what :O
[06:00:52] <gotwig> now its removed
[06:00:53] <gotwig> I g2g...
[06:00:58] <gotwig> see you later, Sir :=)
[06:01:05] <dblosevn> gotwig: before you go
[06:01:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: you might try posting to save.php on your server and not appleinis
[06:01:40] <gotwig> dblosevn, I know
[06:01:51] <dblosevn> $(".editable_textarea").editable("http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/php/save.php"
[06:01:52] <gotwig> dblosevn, send me a mail if you like... gotwig@ubuntu.com
[06:01:55] <dblosevn> that wont work
[06:02:03] <gotwig> dblosevn, yeah I know :D
[06:02:06] <gotwig> bye :X
[06:02:10] <dblosevn> $(".editable_textarea").editable("save.php") that will
[06:02:19] <gotwig> yeah I know xD
[06:02:25] <gotwig> but I still dont know how echo.php is built
[06:03:00] <dblosevn> and ... $(".click").editable("echo.php", {  is why its using echo.php
[06:03:10] <marcdebl> hello guys, can i ask some thing here

[06:05:44] <pythonsnake> btw sorry for bothering you so much :(
[06:06:03] <dblosevn> pythonsnake: that would work if you actually had a div for the second option
[06:06:24] <pythonsnake> mhm
[06:06:27] <pythonsnake> if not?
[06:06:47] <pythonsnake> is there a more versatile alt?

[06:23:09] <dblosevn> t4nk323: quit flooding the channel thats a sure way to get ignored
[06:23:50] <dblosevn> t4nk323: the first argument to .bind is the context, the rest of the arguments are passed to the function
[06:24:21] <dblosevn> so whatever you pass iinto bind as the first argument will be this inside the function
[06:26:09] <t4nk323> dblosevn That is right but the problem is only binded argument is present inside function
[06:26:34] <dblosevn> a is the only thing passed into the function
[06:26:46] <t4nk323> dblosevn  is not present
[06:26:57] <t4nk323> x is not present
[06:27:25] <dblosevn> well sorry x is the only arg passed to the function
[06:27:44] <dblosevn> give me a minute and ill show you
[06:29:27] <t4nk323> <dblosevn>  In firefox it is working i.e b is getting value of x
[06:32:31] <dblosevn> t4nk323: http://jsfiddle.net/wGgny/
[06:33:24] <dblosevn> open the console and you will see what i told you is the expected result
[06:36:39] <dblosevn> it properly set the context (this) to myobj, passed in the arbitrary value that was set in the bind and passed in the argument from abc()
[06:38:24] <t4nk323> <dblosevn> it does does not work in IE
[06:38:39] <t4nk323> that is the problem
[06:39:12] <hemanth_> is there a way to implement a conditional prevent default?
[06:39:28] <t4nk323> <dblosevn> b becomes undefined  inside

[06:48:36] <hemanth_> nah, i want don want to prevent for two spaces in a row dblosevn
[06:49:05] <dblosevn> ?english @ hemanth_
[06:49:26] <dblosevn> oh
[06:49:51] <dblosevn> so if the last char was space and the next char is space preventDefault?
[06:50:00] <hemanth_> dblosevn,  consecutive spaces but result in no prevent default
[06:50:26] <dblosevn> so ' ' ' ' allow ' ' prevent
[06:50:28] <serdem> Dover, done! thanks
[06:50:58] <Qtax> ok to make a plugin callable as $.foo() (without calling on a jquery object)? in that case how? just setting $.foo = function ... ?

[07:17:31] <ner0x> Anyone using dataTables know how to make it only send the search parameters via ajax after a few seconds of "no typing" rather than on keypress?
[07:18:24] <Qtax> does the standard require the quotes there? i thought they were optional
[07:18:27] <dblosevn> ?debounce @ner0x
[07:19:02] <ner0x> dblosevn: Bot command?
[07:19:08] <hemanth_> dblosevn, missing something? http://jsfiddle.net/gSWwp/25/

[07:20:55] <ner0x> dblosevn: That's a definite fix. I was hoping to use a native dataTables command/config
[07:21:19] <itatitat> ey guys,  in the callback function, after call ajax, I compare the value that is returned and I'm comparing to the value "success", but never is the same, and I know is "success"
[07:21:21] <itatitat> what's hapenning?
[07:21:29] <dblosevn> maybe i dont really know the dataTables api :-( but i know that works lol

[07:22:43] <Qtax> np

[07:51:09] <JohnB12> I'm trying to take a div and slide it up when someone clicks on the h2 tag, then slide it down if they click it again. You can see the site here http://imunderdevelopment.com/dev/ The reservations box, I want to move up when it's clicked. I looked into toggleslide, but I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted. Is there a better way?
[07:51:22] <pojo> function functionName(a, b){} var abc = functionName.bind(this, "A"); abc('B'); b is undefined in case of IE
[07:54:07] <gotwig> dblosevn_away, are you there :X?
[07:54:28] <Brodingo> JohnB12 you could make it toggle a class and add a css transition to handle the animation
[07:55:36] <JohnB12> Brodingo: I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Do you have a document or example I could take a look at?
[07:56:32] <zafu> I'm trying to put a variable in $.ajax({data: {this.name: 'remove'}}) but get an error "missing : after property id"
[07:56:58] <zafu> apparently it pukes on  'this.name:'
[07:57:22] <davemo> zafu, what is the value of this.name
[07:57:46] <zafu> an integer
[07:58:50] <davemo> you can't have integers as keys
[07:58:56] <davemo> JS converts them to strings
[07:59:02] <JohnB12> I was able to get it to slide up, using .animate but since the id=go is made to slide up, how to I get .animate to use id=go to slide down, if it's already slid up?
[07:59:13] <zafu> davemo: so this.name+'' ?
[07:59:29] <zafu> hmm, no
[08:00:02] <marek108> here's a style question: how should I camelize jQuery in a function name? I'm naming a function along the lines of "isJQueryLoaded", compare to "isjQueryLoaded" or even "isJqueryLoaded"?
[08:00:06] <davemo> zafu: are you trying to do an AJAX call that removes a resource?
[08:00:12] <zafu> yes
[08:00:25] <davemo> zafu: you should do an HTTP DELETE to the resource url
[08:00:33] <zafu> but the key=>values stuff is reversed
[08:00:54] <zafu> what's an HTTP DELETE?
[08:01:05] <davemo> zafu: are you familiar with HTTP?
[08:01:07] <systemfault> davemo: Only makes sense for REST apis :P
[08:01:10] <davemo> POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, PATCH
[08:01:19] <zafu> okay
[08:01:19] <Brodingo> JohnB12 http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/kZJjE/
[08:01:44] <zafu> davemo: what does it bring beyond POST ?
[08:01:52] <davemo> zafu: if you have the ability to change your API, that is your server side AJAX endpoint, I suggest reworking it so that it uses HTTP verbs
[08:02:21] <zafu> I can do it (mod_perl stuff)
[08:02:42] <davemo> if you jsut want to add the params to $.fn.ajax in the data property, I might rework it like so
[08:03:03] <davemo> $.ajax({ data: { action: 'remove', id: 9 }});
[08:03:05] <JohnB12> brodingo: That is fantastic, Thank you
[08:03:24] <davemo> where id is the id of the thing you want to remove
[08:03:25] <zafu> davemo: so the key can't be a var?
[08:03:36] <zafu> in a js object?
[08:03:55] <davemo> zafu: what are you wanting to parameterize, the action?
[08:04:08] <AskMP> c|_| Morning Allâ€¦
[08:04:25] <zafu> davemo: your example is fine, just wondering about the key not being a var,
[08:04:32] <zafu> in general
[08:04:55] <davemo> you can always do whatever you want, you'll just need to use [ ] lookup notation
[08:04:56] <bdesham> I have an element on my page that I will be hiding and showing with slideToggle(). what's the best-practice css for having the element hidden when the page first loads?
[08:04:59] <davemo> obj[var] = val
[08:05:12] <davemo> obj.var = val <- does not work
[08:05:25] <zafu> I see, thanks
[08:05:53] <zafu> or {obj.var: id } :)
[08:06:31] <davemo> zafu: that won't work
[08:06:38] <davemo> try it in your console
[08:06:43] <zafu> now I get why
[08:07:00] <jrajav> marek108: Why do you have a function named like that at all? Aren't you using .noConflict() + a closure for scoping?
[08:07:21] <davemo> zafu: you'll need to build the object literal before stuffing it into the $.ajax call
[08:07:37] <jrajav> marek108: Anyway, there's no right answer, it's just what looks best to you
[08:08:14] <marek108> jrajav: good question; my script gets inserted into third party pages, which may or may not have jQuery included
[08:08:21] <davemo> bdesham: I usually just create a helper class like .hidden { display: none; } in my stylesheet and apply it to elements that I want to be hidden on page load
[08:09:17] <zafu> davemo: like 'var obj = {}; obj[this.name]=id; $.ajax({ data: obj })' ?
[08:09:24] <bdesham> davemo: ok. how can I specify that when the element is shown, it should have "display: block"?
[08:09:26] <davemo> zafu:  you got it :)
[08:09:28] <fulminator> can someone help me: when I hover on the last item of each row all divs go mad: http://jsfiddle.net/mqBuX/
[08:09:30] <zafu> :)
[08:09:33] <jrajav> marek108: So include it.
[08:09:47] <jrajav> marek108: Do you not know how to add jQuery to a page dynamically?
[08:10:09] <davemo> bdesham: you could do it with jQuery's .css function, or you could assign another class to the element that contains the style information you want
[08:10:24] <davemo> bdesham: ie: $(el).css({ display: block; });
[08:10:28] <jrajav> The class option is much better
[08:10:47] <davemo> or $(el).addClass('block-displayer');
[08:10:53] <marek108> jrajav: that's what I'm doing, but in case it's already there, I skip dynamcally including it, hence why I ask "is jquery already loaded". Am I missing a better way of doing it?
[08:10:53] <davemo> (but with a more semantic name, of course) :P
[08:10:56] <jrajav> Anytime you use anonymous .css() is another liability for debugging
[08:11:01] <bdesham> davemo jrajav: you're right, I do like the class idea better. thanks!
[08:11:27] <davemo> jrajav: normally i agree, but sometimes you do want an inline style to guarantee the information is applied to the renderer
[08:11:30] <jrajav> marek108: I guess not
[08:12:03] <jrajav> davemo: I'm not sure why an anonymous style is any greater a guarantee than a CSS class
[08:12:06] <fulminator> can someone help me: when I hover on the last item of each row all divs go mad: http://jsfiddle.net/mqBuX/ it's because of the float:left css, but
[08:12:27] <fulminator> I can't find any other solutions
[08:12:41] <jrajav> davemo: I mean, you could have a bug in your CSS, of course, but it's definitely more manageable for debugging and maintenance to have everything well organized into class hierarchies
[08:13:01] <davemo> jrajav: inline styles take higher precedence due to the order of specificity
[08:13:45] <davemo> inline > #id > .class > attribute
[08:13:46] <jrajav> Oh, so you just want a shortcut to not have to deal with organizing the hierarchy
[08:14:07] <jrajav> Well, it's exactly shortcuts like that that make most large style bases hell to deal with
[08:14:25] <davemo> jrajav: sometimes an inline style is the best way to guarantee your styling information is applied, especially in a hostile environment where you don't know all the sources of styling information
[08:14:31] <davemo> jrajav: you see it a lot in jquery plugins
[08:14:40] <jrajav> I guess if you're monkey-patching an existing page
[08:14:51] <jrajav> If you're developing something yourself from scratch, I don't see much excuse
[08:14:52] <davemo> jrajav: i'm not advocating it as a best practice, i'm saying it's an option and sometimes it's desirable :)

[08:39:15] <ggherdov> Hi all. Say that you have a collection COLL of stuff (integers, but anyway), and all you want to do with it is to check for membership, i.e. tell if the element FOO is already in COLL or not. What data structure would you use for COLL ? A plain Object? an Array? and what is, then, the method to check for membership?
[08:39:18] <jrajav> Similar to the .textContent = method for escaping for normal HTML?
[08:39:31] <jrajav> textContent/innerText doesn't deal with quotes, that's the problem
[08:39:42] <maxmoore14> so rather than <a href="page.htm" data-reload="true"> or $.mobile.changePage('page.htm', {reload: true})
[08:39:49] <gnarf> jrajav: $("a").text( text ).html() ?
[08:40:07] <maxmoore14> it would be something like <div data-role="page" data-reload="true">
[08:40:18] <maxmoore14> anything like that possible?
[08:40:42] <maxmoore14> essentially prevent the page from living in cache ever

[08:41:28] <jrajav> gnarf: Thanks, I'll look into both of those
[08:41:41] <jrajav> gnarf: Though I assume jQuery is going to just escape those internally, anyway

[09:18:59] <Krambiorix> ok, it adds a context menu to the element

[09:38:08] <rmill> BarryKenobi: wat issue
[09:38:33] <BarryKenobi> yeah like I said, seems to be back online. It looked like a WPMU error - domain mapping problem, obviously temporary :-)

[09:44:54] <snow_> Hello
[09:45:12] <snow_> I had a jQuery UI question if anybody has a moment.
[09:45:41] <benjick> How can I make a div "grow"?
[09:45:53] <benjick> I could just change the css but that would look ugly
[09:52:36] <snow_> The same way normal animations work; you increment the CSS against a timer.
[09:53:05] <snow_> You can use exponential curves to smooth the change or accelerate it at certain intervals.
[09:57:09] <ahimsa> Hi there, is there an md5 implementation available for jquery? I tried searching the plugins registry but didn't find anything.
[09:58:33] <snover> ahimsa: jquery is a dom library, you need a cryptography library. dojo has one.
[09:58:43] <ahimsa> From google I found some jquery-md5 git but it was last updated 2 years ago, so I was wondering if that's still current or if there's something more up to date. Not that md5 implementation itself would change, but... :)
[10:00:11] <snover> what are you trying to use md5 for anyway
[10:00:47] <ahimsa> To make an md5 hash from a string.
[10:01:27] <ahimsa> So I should just use https://github.com/placemarker/jQuery-MD5 ?
[10:01:34] <snover> for what reason are you creating a hash of a string
[10:02:28] <ahimsa> Checksum, sort of.
[10:09:26] <adelgado> Is there a regex operator for something like this? :checkbox[id^='']
[10:10:39] <BillCriswell> adelgado: id starting with nothing is a weird thing to want.
[10:10:50] <BillCriswell> [id='']:checkbox should work just fine.
[10:11:15] <BillCriswell> I have some serious questions about what why you're trying to do that, but I'm also busy... so have fun!
[10:11:26] <adelgado> BillCriswell: Do you know what ^= does?
[10:11:42] <gotwig> eat me, before I eat PHP..
[10:11:56] <BillCriswell> adelgado: It tests the start of a string.
[10:12:08] <gotwig> adelgado, ^ is for the first charachter of the string
[10:12:20] <BillCriswell> The first characterS
[10:17:33] <adelgado> gotwig, BillCriswell: I'm using it as negation and oddly enough, it works. Is there a regex operator like ~= ? I don't control the HTML and I'm trying to avoid looping through every checkbox on the page.
[10:18:22] <BillCriswell> adelgado: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[10:18:32] <jnettik> is .html() supposed to strip out all the markup you pass into it?
[10:18:42] <marek108> no
[10:18:49] <marek108> .text(), yes
[10:19:00] <jnettik> any reason it seems to be doing that?
[10:19:27] <adelgado> BillCriswell: I guess not. Thanks. I'll switch to !=
[10:19:43] <BillCriswell> There's a ~= right on that page.
[10:19:45] <jnettik> i'm getting an html string from an xml feed. if i check my source the html looks fine. but the rendering looks as if there is no markup and none of my css styles take
[10:20:00] <caseyd> hey, I'm having some trouble with z-index on a drop down menu. I'm using a jquery dropdown menu, superfish. http://demo.caseydavis.net/wyattlaw/ - it's the drop down menu from the "Your Rights" button. It pops up under the "practice areas" button and I'd like it to be on top. I've tried forcing a zindex with this code http://pastebin.com/kSSmjpXW and the zindex is there.. its just not working. Any suggest
[10:20:00] <caseyd> ions would be greatly appreciated!
[10:22:31] <adelgado> BillCriswell: Sorry, yes, contains, not regex according to that page.
[10:32:47] <l0cal> Hi, How can i get data from iframe using jquery?
[10:33:35] <BillCriswell> l0cal: .contents()
[10:33:48] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[10:35:28] <l0cal> can you please give me an example?
[10:37:49] <BillCriswell> l0cal: There's examples on that page.
[10:37:53] <l0cal> this doesn't work  var a = $("#frameDemo").contents().find("body")
[10:38:15] <l0cal> it's wrong?
[10:38:47] <BillCriswell> What's the src on the iframe? If it's remote it won't work.
[10:39:05] <l0cal> remote
[10:39:14] <BillCriswell> Well, there you go.
[10:39:42] <l0cal> isn't there a way for work?
[10:41:22] <BillCriswell> l0cal: If you use PHP you can do src="/load_remote_url.php?url=http://remote.com" and in load_remote_url echo file_get_contents($_GET['url']); THis is extremely unsafe and you should sanitize $_GET['url'].. but that's the long and short of it.
[10:43:28] <l0cal> i want to try send client request to server... server will get a code with ipaddress something like that because of this i want to use iframe
[10:43:44] <l0cal> iframe doesn't work local file too?
[10:45:11] <BillCriswell> l0cal: It does work with local file.
[10:45:55] <BillCriswell> PHP can get content from another website, JavaScript can not (easily), so you'd use a local PHP script to grab the remote website and fake it's localness.
[10:51:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come var selectedaccordionid = $("#folders_" + selectedtabid).accordion('option', 'active'); gives me back [object][object] instead of an index value?
[10:58:58] <zfmf> he guys, i'm using jquery validate plugin, i create a new method, $('input[name=Licence]').valid() method is not waiting until the ajax call ended? http://pastebin.com/84MzSrMp how can i do this anyone an idea?
[10:59:32] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: That's what it should be returning as far as I'm aware. Don't have much experience with these.
[11:02:31] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: selectedaccordionid should be a jquery object ( the active one )
[11:05:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how would i define that?
[11:06:38] <snow_> Has anybody had an issue with z-index displaying improperly with jQuery popovers
[11:08:36] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Taking a look now.

[11:16:45] <vedic> I have a nested html pages (i.e. one html page is calling another html page to fill a particular <div>). Both the pages have javascript defined. If a jquery namespace is defined in first page, will that be available in the html coming from another page and filling up <div> inside first page itself?
[11:18:22] <TeckniX> vedic: so you would want the JS within your 2nd html to be executed by the 1st one?
[11:19:01] <vedic> TeckniX: global variable defined in 1st should be accessible in 2nd
[11:19:27] <TeckniX> vedic: define 'calling another html'
[11:20:43] <vedic> TeckniX: get request response brings 2nd page inside 1st
[11:21:56] <TeckniX> vedic: so the request response would need to parse any JS within your 2nd page - correct?
[11:22:30] <vedic> TechniX: yea
[11:25:09] <TeckniX> then why not return the data as json and place the html where needed then parse the JS part of it.
[11:25:50] <TeckniX> so like { html: '<span>Html is here</span>', js: '$("#output span").addClass("red");' }

[11:42:26] <StephenS> grafi, now what ?
[11:43:06] <grafi> im thinking more along the lines of why wouldnt you use jquery when trying to get help in the jquery channel...
[11:43:23] <grafi> why would a sane person even try to make ajax work without jquery

[11:57:10] <gf3> Brodingo: Fuckin' love those shits
[11:57:14] <guideX> thinkerweb: you need a db of tires
[11:57:21] <Brodingo> gf3 i knew you would
[11:57:51] <thinkerweb> guideX, you sure, http://www.dettmertires.com/tirefitmentguide.htm
[11:58:21] <vovva> i have a li list, where all li's have a .click function, but when i add a li (width js) the new li don't get a .click function, how can i fix this? Do i need to run $('li').click(...); every time i add a li?
[11:58:22] <thinkerweb> they both have it, and I think they are using some online source for db.  Some endeaversuite.com
[11:58:48] <Brodingo> ?on @ vovva
[11:58:48] <bot-t> vovva, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:58:56] <Brodingo> check the second example
[11:59:05] <vovva> thanks!
[11:59:42] <guideX> thinkerweb: you can use online sources, either way need a source.. I think all charge for it
[11:59:51] <guideX> i've done fitment websites
[12:00:16] <thinkerweb> guideX, hmm, can you teach me too please
[12:00:53] <guideX> thinkerweb: have you seen tireguides.com
[12:00:59] <thinkerweb> guideX, thx
[12:01:08] <guideX> they have the data your after
[12:02:27] <thinkerweb> guideX, any other sources?
[12:02:42] <thinkerweb> tireguides is the main source everyone is using?
[12:03:57] <thinkerweb> guideX, how many hours will it take me to learn how to make a fitment guide app?
[12:09:37] <thinkerweb> guideX, hey
[12:10:01] <ericelliott> hi
[12:10:37] <thinkerweb> I wanna make a tire fitment guide app, and guideX knows how
[12:10:45] <guideX> thinkerweb... there's more than one source
[12:10:49] <guideX> it may take you about a week
[12:11:06] <thinkerweb> guideX, oooh, what other sources?
[12:11:08] <guideX> or at least it takes me a week
[12:11:13] <guideX> well the other sources charge
[12:11:21] <guideX> so as long as you can pay big bux
[12:11:31] <guideX> the one I gave you is free though
[12:12:04] <thinkerweb> guideX, tireguides.com is free? But I dont really know what I am doing, can you give me a little background or where to start?
[12:12:41] <thinkerweb> guideX, which ones charge for it, how much is it?
[12:13:14] <guideX> hmm 1 sec
[12:14:54] <guideX> so on tireguides.com/products there's a contact us
[12:15:06] <guideX> if you contact them and set it up with them, you'll get the tire data
[12:15:24] <guideX> it's next to free I think (less than 20 buxs (or nothing)) depending on what you want
[12:15:43] <guideX> they give you a sql database, mysql .sql file, or a csv
[12:16:05] <guideX> oh a contact us under "Software (downloadable)"
[12:16:27] <guideX> i've never used it, but i've talked to people who have
[12:16:43] <guideX> after that, you build the front end
[12:17:12] <thinkerweb> guideX, how do  you know they are the cheapest?
[12:17:32] <guideX> a friend told me
[12:17:43] <guideX> the same friend who has us3ed it that I know
[12:18:01] <thinkerweb> guideX, what are some other sources to buy it from, do you know?
[12:20:08] <thinkerweb> guideX, does your friend even come on here, whats his/her handle?
[12:20:46] <relipse> is it possible to make a button a link?
[12:21:50] <thinkerweb> relipse, of course, <button id="something">enter</button> then in jquery you code the button action, otherwise you could just put an <a href="" inside the button, or the button inside the <a href=""
[12:22:51] <relipse> oh i'll try a <a href= inside a button
[12:23:02] <relipse> it is for jqueryui dialog buttons
[12:23:15] <thinkerweb> relipse, probably better if button inside <a anchor but not much difference
[12:23:24] <DrDoom> #css
[12:23:31] <DrDoom> sorry mt
[12:26:49] <relipse> think: it didnt owkr
[12:26:54] <relipse> it didn't work
[12:27:03] <thinkerweb> relipse, what, wierd
[12:27:09] <relipse> well i didnt think it would
[12:27:48] <relipse> i'm using buttons { Cancel: function(){ }, "<a href='blah'>Print</a>":function(){} }
[12:27:53] <thinkerweb> relipse, you must have done something wrong
[12:27:57] <relipse> for a jqueryui dialog initialization
[12:28:04] <relipse> no its jqueryui problem
[12:28:23] <relipse> i think using window.location.href is tacky
[12:28:30] <relipse> but i may have to resort to it
[12:28:37] <thinkerweb> relipse, I don't know what kinda code that is
[12:28:48] <relipse> jqueryUI dialog
[12:28:54] <relipse> initialization
[12:29:03] <relipse> let me show you
[12:29:05] <thinkerweb> relipse, do you know the syntax for jquery scripts?
[12:29:26] <relipse> http://paste.ee/r/wTHCZ
[12:29:28] <relipse> check that out
[12:29:36] <relipse> that doesn't even initialize a button except the Cancel button
[12:33:54] <tpyo> i want to create a dialog that enables me to do a confirm? when someone wants to delete one of any element on the page
[12:34:16] <tpyo> am I able to re-use the same dialog? Im finding it tricky to pass information to the dialog (as its creation logic is init)
[12:34:38] <tpyo> im feeling like i'd have to create a dialog for each separate entity
[12:34:48] <tpyo> that could either submit the relevant (hidden) form
[12:34:56] <tpyo> or redirect to the relevant link
[12:35:03] <tpyo> doers my query make sense?
[12:35:38] <tpyo> ive just been examining the docs at: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[12:35:56] <tpyo> and there isn't any information passing so im a little confused... i am very new to jquery
[12:36:05] <tpyo> so im probably just missing some kind of fundamental technique
[12:38:56] <relipse> typo
[12:39:00] <relipse> i actually did that yesterday
[12:39:06] <relipse> i can give you the code
[12:39:25] <tpyo> really?
[12:39:25] <tpyo> <3
[12:39:50] <relipse> yeah i needed a reusable confirm box dialog
[12:39:56] <relipse> here it is
[12:40:10] <relipse> http://paste.ee/r/DzNjY
[12:40:16] <relipse> i'm going to put it on github for fun
[12:40:28] <relipse> all you do is call that function dlgConfirm('Are you sure?')
[12:40:49] <relipse> like this: dlgConfirm('Are you sure?', function(){ alert('you clicked confirm!'); });
[12:41:10] <relipse> you can even put html in the confirmation box!
[12:41:18] <relipse> i put a verify password confirmation box
[12:41:26] <tpyo> wow this looks pretty sexy
[12:41:35] <tpyo> lemme give it a whirl! thanks a ton! :)
[12:42:23] <relipse> like this: dlgConfirm('Enter your password to confirm <input type=password>', function(dlg){  alert('You entered password ' + $('input[type=password]', dlg).val() ); });
[12:43:02] <relipse> and you don't need any html markup on the page because if it doesnt exist, it will just create it on its own
[12:43:20] <relipse> let me know when you got it working and maybe i can check it out :)
[12:43:22] <tpyo> wow
[12:43:55] <tpyo> well the main thing I want to steal is your precious knowledge from reading this code
[12:44:09] <tpyo> but im sure i'll keep a few of the bits but my use case is a tad more specific
[12:44:58] <tpyo> ... is the code at the top to enable overloads?
[12:46:16] <tpyo> and im glad you use my favourite "are you sure" default for the title :)
[12:46:33] <relipse> oh yes if you want to specify button text you can
[12:46:45] <relipse> dlgConfirm('Are you sure?', 'Confirm Box', ...
[12:46:46] <relipse> etc
[12:46:50] <relipse> it tells you what the params are
[12:47:03] <tpyo> aye aye but the bit at the top seems to allow you to use defaults
[12:47:09] <tpyo> and put the function anywhere you want
[12:47:12] <tpyo> that's kinda cute
[12:47:16] <relipse> yeah those ar athe defaults if you don't specify them
[12:47:21] <relipse> yeah put the function anywhere on the page
[12:47:24] <tpyo> i assume jscript doesn't natively support overloads
[12:47:28] <relipse> no it doesnt
[12:47:38] <tpyo> no I mean the function is just the last param
[12:47:47] <tpyo> irrespective of how many you pass in
[12:47:48] <tpyo> it seenms
[12:47:50] <relipse> oh yeah the function is the last param :)
[12:47:55] <tpyo> ya, that's cute
[12:48:01] <relipse> yeah i thought so, i saw someone else doing it
[12:48:12] <relipse> not sure how they implemented it
[12:48:21] <relipse> but that was the functionality
[12:48:46] <relipse> but you have to at least have the text param
[12:48:53] <relipse> function(c_text, callback)
[12:48:56] <relipse> minimum
[12:49:24] <tpyo> aye for sure
[12:49:39] <tpyo> well jscript is very flexible when it comes to arguments, right?
[12:49:43] <relipse> yep
[12:49:49] <tpyo> so you just skip out what you want :)
[12:49:55] <relipse> exactly
[12:50:01] <relipse> if its not a function it is the normal argument
[12:54:01] <relipse> tpyo: any luck?
[12:54:21] <tpyo> still playing atm
[12:56:59] <relipse> is it possible to use jquery on a popup window?
[12:57:14] <relipse> $('input', popup.document) ?
[12:59:31] <tpyo> relipse, how does one formulate the function argument (the last one?)
[12:59:37] <tpyo> is it just functionName(params)
[12:59:44] <tpyo> or are there {} anywhere?
[13:00:16] <Otineb> Hey guys,
[13:01:48] <relipse> function(dialog_element){}
[13:01:56] <relipse> if you need to manipulate the dialog
[13:02:39] <relipse> i was using ajax in my function so i did something like this: function(dlg){ $.getJSON(function(data){ if (data.success){ $(dlg).dialog('close'); } } }
[13:02:42] <Otineb> I've cobbled a function together that will "Title Case" the value of an input field, but now realize that it breaks when I use "CAPS". http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/31/ I'm pretty noobish to jquery and am having issues with how to actually do that.
[13:03:05] <relipse> oh and you return false inside the function to NOT close the dialog
[13:03:13] <relipse> good for ajax stuff
[13:03:25] <relipse> because if there is a problem, the user still has the dialog open
[13:03:56] <relipse> if you need a sample i can get one of my usage snippets
[13:04:41] <tpyo> its cool i'll figure it :)
[13:09:08] <Otineb> @relipse: Do you know much about what I was talking about? Trying to get my function to take the first char and uppercase it, then take every other character (before a space) and lowercase it. (Resulting in a Title Case Value)
[13:10:20] <relipse> you want me to write that function for you
[13:10:31] <relipse> chances are someone already wrote what you wanted and google would help you?
[13:10:44] <relipse> or you could spend time doing string manipulation, i would start by using regular expressions
[13:10:55] <relipse> regex buddy will help you do that
[13:11:12] <relipse> other than that you'd have to pay me to sit down and write it for you (:
[13:12:47] <masentinel900> Hello everybody
[13:12:56] <masentinel900> I have got a question.
[13:13:11] <masentinel900> I can put this line?  ::  var infoData = $(this).parent().val();
[13:13:22] <Otineb> @relipse I was looking for direction. Not you to write it. I think I'm close now. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/32/
[13:14:27] <relipse> masentinel900: looks fine to me
[13:14:29] <Otineb> I just need this to actually add every char after 1 to the end and I'll be set (i hope!)
[13:14:46] <Otineb> @relipse didn't mean to sound like a loafer
[13:15:03] <Otineb> sorry man
[13:15:03] <masentinel900> I need get this   ::    <a>this value</a>
[13:15:21] <NLZ_13> masentinel900, use .html instead of .val
[13:15:28] <NLZ_13> .html() instead of .val() *
[13:15:49] <relipse> yeah html()
[13:15:52] <NLZ_13> if i think correctly waht you are trying
[13:15:55] <relipse> val() is .value
[13:16:46] <masentinel900> But if I put this get the complete html of the tag
[13:17:40] <T-Co> If you only need the textual representation inside an element, use .text() it's a lot faster: http://jsperf.com/jquery-text-vs-html/3
[13:18:00] <tpyo> omg relipse, that shit is awesome
[13:18:03] <tpyo> works nice
[13:18:22] <tpyo> only a small issue.... being that I added in the style from the ui.jquery example
[13:18:28] <tpyo> and the message is no longer a message
[13:18:33] <tpyo> just a ton of weird symbols
[13:18:36] <tpyo> very odd :D
[13:20:18] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/DgWMj/
[13:20:39] <tpyo> but i just switched to one of my styles
[13:20:45] <tpyo> and now its sexy and sweet
[13:20:52] <tpyo> a thousand thank yous relipse! :)
[13:20:54] <tpyo> much <3
[13:22:47] <relipse> np tpyo: good timing since i just amde it yesterday
[13:23:03] <relipse> you got a public page where it is done?
[13:25:16] <tpyo> not yet
[13:25:28] <tpyo> you usually here?
[13:26:20] <tpyo> if you are then i'll come in here and ping you when its pu
[13:26:22] <tpyo> up(
[13:26:26] <tpyo> up*
[13:27:13] <masentinel900> Now I have this :::  var infoData = $(this).parent().text();
[13:27:32] <Otineb> @relipse: string manipulation was the key. Thanks man
[13:27:35] <Otineb> got it working
[13:28:04] <relipse> usually i try to come up with a regex for something like that
[13:28:26] <relipse> tpyo: yeah i guess
[13:29:21] <masentinel900> But now that is get me the <li> values and the <ul> values because I have got with the same class.
[13:31:26] <masentinel900> I want to know how can I create a rule for that takes just a specific class an only the li tags
[13:34:12] <NoiseEee> $('li.className')
[13:34:54] <vsmith> Hey guys im getting a wierd error on my website and cant figure it out.   here is my site:   http://philoveracity.com/
[13:35:00] <vsmith> can anyone help
[13:36:48] <Brodingo> vsmith you're using 1.9 in which $.browser is removed
[13:36:50] <shoky> vsmith: your site is using jquery 1.9.0 but the plugin jquery.sexyslider doesnt work with new jquery
[13:37:02] <shoky> at least that version
[13:37:11] <Brodingo> yeah go back to 1.8
[13:37:12] <relipse> vsmith: i found your problem
[13:37:30] <relipse> vsmith: you have a smily face at the bottom of your page
[13:37:54] <Brodingo> very troublesome
[13:39:24] <vsmith> Thanks shoky
[13:41:33] <vsmith> Thanks relipse
[13:51:05] <Otineb> in case anyone cares: This script will format input fields onBlur to Title Case reliably. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/
[13:51:26] <b0ot> what is the best way to pass values to a website?
[13:51:30] <masentinel900> With this line takes the <ul> value tag  of <li>  ::  		var infoData = $(this).parent().find('li').parent().find('a').text();
[13:51:57] <b0ot> right now I'm using highcharts and doing something along the lines of $.get('num.txt', function(data) { var theY = data; series.addPoint([x, theY], true, true); });
[13:52:18] <b0ot> and I have a script that just keeps writing to num.txt
[13:52:23] <b0ot> but there has to be a better way to do it
[13:56:06] <Shes> join #html5
[13:56:16] <Shes> sorry about that, missing a /
[14:11:37] <masentinel900> Somebody that help me please!!
[14:11:48] <masentinel900> var infoData = $(this).parent().find('li').parent().find('a').text();
[14:12:33] <masentinel900> that line just get <li><ul>This value</ul></li>
[14:13:55] <masentinel900> <li>I need get the value that goes here<ul></ul></li>
[14:17:53] <relipse> what is the correct way to fix the placeholder problem in unsupported browsers
[14:18:06] <gf3> Ignore them
[14:18:39] <gf3> Or you could use this â†’ https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder
[14:18:46] <gf3> But it's easier to just ignore them
[14:21:55] <raj> ajpiano, ping
[14:25:36] <gf3> ajpingo
[14:44:06] <raj> how can I make the default width for an `input` element be the width of the placeholder, using this function http://stackoverflow.com/a/1288475/997624
[14:45:48] <linusoleander> Anyone know a working plugin for scrolling text horizontal?
[15:21:03] <bradmaxs> I am trying to get the height of an image that resizes dynamically with 100% width of the browser.  I keep getting the real width and not the resized width. http://jsfiddle.net/Y94MF/2/
[15:22:27] <vovva> bradmaxs: try to get the width of the wrapping element
[15:22:39] <vovva> i mean height
[15:23:22] <bradmaxs> hey vovva: thanks for the reply.  Here in lies the rub.  I am trying to set the height of the wrapping element with the height of the image:)
[15:25:44] <vovva> bradmaxs: if the wrapper isn't float:left or position:absolute the width and height will be the same as the image
[15:26:13] <vovva> then take those walues and add to the wrapper yoy want to modify
[15:26:25] <vovva> you*
[15:26:33] <bradmaxs> vovva: it is absolute:(
[15:26:36] <Augnar_The_Barba> any rec's for a nice jquery contact form
[15:27:01] <vovva> then make an other wrapper with out
[15:27:22] <bradmaxs> vovva: good idea.  I'll give ti a try
[15:33:28] <gnarf> linusoleander: http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/ ?
[15:33:50] <linusoleander> gnarf: It's supr laggy
[15:37:00] <gnarf> linusoleander: the demo looks pretty responsive to me
[15:37:13] <gnarf> the demos on the bottom are actual <marquee> tags
[15:37:24] <linusoleander> Then It might had been another problem, I'm not sure
[15:37:31] <linusoleander> I've tried the plugin twice
[15:47:32] <jasonthesensei> just digging into jQuery i have what seems to be a simple question but I cant figure it out. Is there a way to go through an html document and get all the classes and IDs using jQuery
[15:48:46] <vovva> jasonthesensei: $('your css selector') ex: $('#myID')
[15:50:09] <jasonthesensei> yes but say I dont know what the classes or IDs are and I want to get them for all elements on the page not the actual css
[15:50:31] <jasonthesensei> @vovva: thanks,  yes but say I dont know what the classes or IDs are and I want to get them for all elements on the page not the actual css
[15:50:32] <b-ot> jasonthesensei: I am not in I.
[15:51:33] <vovva> hmmm, $('*').attr('id')
[15:52:01] <shoky> jasonthesensei:  $('*').filter(function(){ return this.id }).map(function(){ return this.id })    :\
[15:52:33] <shoky> add a .get()  at the end to get a real array
[15:52:39] <jasonthesensei> @vovva & shoky: Thanks again, but wouldnt this return just the first instance?
[15:52:51] <shoky> jasonthesensei: vovva's would only return the first, yes
[15:53:08] <shoky> jasonthesensei:  mine would return an array.. what do you need this for..?
[15:53:35] <jasonthesensei> A plugin for Brackets
[15:54:02] <raj> yo shoky ;)
[15:54:11] <shoky> ey raj
[15:54:45] <jasonthesensei> @shoky & vovva: Thanks a lot
[16:02:08] <bradmaxs> ugh.  no go on the out div not positioned.  Is there a way to get an 100% image's new height on browser resize?  I have this but it is only getting the images real height and not resized height: http://jsfiddle.net/Y94MF/2/
[16:03:36] <bryanstedman> jasonthesensei: I have been wanting to look at building plugins for brackets, but haven't got around to it. How are you finding it?
[16:04:08] <ogk1000> any ideas how to get this sticky sidebar to stop at the bottom of the content container its in ? http://ogkey.com/s3/
[16:04:45] <jasonthesensei> @bryanstedman Fairly straight forward mostly html css js with some node sprinkled in
[16:05:39] <Whirl3d> ogk, I'd check in #css, they are better equipped to handle that.
[16:06:17] <jasonthesensei>  @bryanstedman: you want the image to scale vert as  well
[16:06:33] <raj> what's a good way to load some json when a page loads?
[16:06:40] <raj> sorry, when's a good time
[16:08:02] <jasonthesensei> @bradmaxs looking at your fiddle now
[16:08:44] <jasonthesensei>  @bradmaxs: you want the image to scale on both axis???
[16:10:07] <bradmaxs> jasonthesensei: yes!
[16:11:35] <bradmaxs> jasonthesensei: I needed to find the height of the image to put that onto the container.  I was having trouble but realized by way of the suggestion of vovva that I could use the outer div height to resize the container since it resizes to the images size.
[16:12:09] <bradmaxs> I am going to save that piece of code you made though for another time:) Thanks jasonthesensei and vovva!
[16:14:24] <bryanstedman> @bradmaxs Maybe I am misunderstanding, but have you tried 'img { min-height: 100%;}' ?
[16:14:41] <shoky> raj: that question doesnt mean much without context
[16:15:03] <shoky> raj: it's a good time to load something when you need it, or before ;P
[16:15:18] <bryanstedman> @bradmaxs http://jsfiddle.net/Y94MF/5/
[16:15:34] <bradmaxs> bryanstedman: It's complicated:)
[16:16:13] <vovva> raj: and as late as possible, so the webpage is loaded as fast as possible
[16:17:08] <StephenS> hello
[16:17:26] <StephenS> I have div id="test" and when I $(div).append(html); I get output 00000000
[16:17:46] <shoky> $(div) ?
[16:17:47] <StephenS> but when I go to url ajax.php I see only one zero, so my question is how to append current value, but to not remain last value?
[16:17:57] <vovva> $('#test').append(html);
[16:18:02] <bradmaxs> bryanstedman: I am using jquery tools scrollable.  You MUST set a minimum height to the wrapper.  My scroller is 100% width of browser and so is the images in each slide.  But when the user resizes I needed to reset the wrapper height to accommodate the new photo height. Was actually easier than I thought.  Just got the size of the slide (div) holding the image and viola!
[16:18:17] <gnarf> `api html @StephenS
[16:18:17] <b-ot> StephenS: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[16:18:23] <bradmaxs> bryanstedman: thanks for helping.
[16:18:40] <gnarf> StephenS: works as a setter too, basically .empty().append()
[16:19:14] <StephenS> gnarf, thank you
[16:19:19] <StephenS> that is what I looked for :)
[16:19:24] <jasonthesensei> @shoky: Thanks again
[16:19:31] <bryanstedman> @bradmaxs Sure thing - sorry I wasn't actually much help, but glad you got it sorted
[16:19:35] <StephenS> $(div).empty().append(html); is working now :)
[16:19:48] <shoky> :\
[16:19:52] <bradmaxs> bryanstedman: Any help is good help.
[16:26:16] <StephenS> one q: how ajax slow down website?
[16:50:39] <jasonthesensei> @shoky: i modified that code slightly to get classes as well as id but I ran in to a new problem I need to exclude the classes applied to the page via modernizr any ideas
[16:56:44] <bradmaxs> I am trying to get a function to delay until all elements are loaded on the page.  Any ideas?
[16:57:38] <raj> shoky, I don't want any delay in when it's requested and when it's retrieved
[16:57:43] <raj> I want it to be immediate
[16:58:55] <raj> by 'it', I mean array
[17:02:09] <disappearedng> Hey if i have this in a script jQuery.fn.extend({jCountdown: does this mean that when the script is successfully loaded $.jCountdown shoould be defined?
[17:04:06] <raj> nm, got it
[17:07:56] <gnarf> disappearedng: that would be jQuery().jCountdown()
[17:08:40] <gnarf> if you want jQuery.jCountdown you can just jQuery.jCountdown = ....
[17:16:08] <xenaxon> hi. how to find out if the current element is the first or last in the dom
[17:16:08] <xenaxon> ?
[17:19:15] <gf3> `api index @ xenaxon
[17:19:16] <b-ot> xenaxon: .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[17:23:15] <xenaxon> how to get last element out of a set?
[17:24:53] <JFranks> With jqueryui's http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#collapsible I've got the desire to load the accordian fully collapsed.. but I don't see any methods?
[17:26:11] <jost> `api last @ xenaxon
[17:26:11] <b-ot> xenaxon: .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[17:31:03] <JFranks> I guess if collapse = true, and then I could send a click event to the first H3 ... that would simulate it.. ;p
[17:32:06] <xenaxon> jost: how do I get index of last element
[17:32:19] <xenaxon> or how do I find out if a selected element is the last one
[17:34:00] <jost> xenaxon, what are you trying to do?
[17:34:12] <xenaxon> I'm doing a slider
[17:34:20] <xenaxon> and I need to check if the current slide is the last
[17:34:26] <xenaxon> the slides are li elements
[17:34:33] <jost> `api length @ xenaxon
[17:34:33] <b-ot> xenaxon: .length: The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[17:34:49] <xenaxon> so I compare the index of the element to the length ?
[17:35:50] <thujone> you can just use :last filter
[17:37:17] <jost> that would probably be better
[17:37:35] <thujone> .is(':last-child')
[17:40:21] <xenaxon> are you sure it's better
[17:40:21] <xenaxon> ?
[17:40:29] <xenaxon> does it work in any situation?
[17:41:17] <thujone> yes, it's better
[17:41:24] <thujone> yes, it works in any situation
[17:42:09] <jost> thujone, are you sure? If the set contains elements with different parents, it does not what is expected... but in this case, it should work.
[17:44:40] <xenaxon> how do I get the last sibling of a child I already have sleected
[17:45:25] <thujone> yes, you should be careful about what you're iterating over
[17:45:58] <sevengraff> hello jquery is awesome please keep being awesome :)
[17:45:59] <thujone> $(this).find('li:last-child')
[17:46:27] <xenaxon> I used: $currentSlide.siblings(":first");
[17:46:37] <xenaxon> hope it's the best solution
[17:46:49] <Qtax> any idea what does jquery (or something else) do that __doPostBack(...) (asp.net) doesn't work from a click handler, but works if done via setTimeout("__doPostBack(...)", 1)?
[17:46:53] <thujone> how is that the last slide?
[17:47:40] <xenaxon> sorry, I copied from the first
[17:47:42] <Qtax> and by doesn't work i mean that the page reloads but doesnt seem to post anything properly.
[17:47:44] <xenaxon> it's the same thing
[17:47:48] <thujone> scope has changed in a timeout?
[17:47:49] <xenaxon> only with last instead of first
[17:47:58] <thujone> that's a fine way to do it, too
[17:48:23] <Qtax> thujone, what would be an issue with the scope of a click handler?
[17:48:47] <Qtax> why do i have to use a timeout(string)? timeout(function) doesnt work either.
[17:49:15] <thujone> are you talking about a particular browser not working?
[17:49:44] <xenaxon> thujone: any idea how I can vertically center an absolutely positioned anchor(block) withing an absolutely positioned li
[17:49:52] <xenaxon> I've tried top 50% with css
[17:49:55] <sevengraff> I have a click and I want to walk up the parents of the clicked element until I find a <table>, what is the way to do that?
[17:50:05] <xenaxon> but it's calculating 50% from whole browser window
[17:50:19] <thujone> so you can't do a setTimeout(function() {...}, 1)
[17:50:22] <thujone> ?
[17:51:58] <Qtax> thujone, latest chrome, not tested in others but i'm expecting same results
[17:52:49] <xenaxon> thujone: any idea how I can vertically center an absolutely positioned anchor(block) withing an absolutely positioned li
[17:52:52] <Qtax> plain call to __doPostBack() doesnt work, setTimeout(function(){ __doPostBack() }, 1); doesnt work
[17:52:53] <thujone> you should be able to put whatever code you want inside the anonymous function (not just a string)
[17:53:06] <Qtax> setTimeout("__doPostBack()", 1) works
[17:53:29] <thujone> it seems like a scope issue
[17:53:57] <Qtax> bleh
[17:54:12] <thujone> pass something into the anonymous function()
[17:54:26] <Qtax> doesnt help
[17:54:41] <thujone> what error are you getting
[17:55:20] <thujone> i don't know .net, but it seems like you shouldn't be messing with __doPostBack()
[17:55:21] <Qtax> no error. page just reloads, but data doesnt seem to be posted, so __doPostBack() is not doing what it should
[17:55:53] <Qtax> i dont know .net either, but this is what was used here before i put it in a click handler
[17:56:05] <Qtax> inside click handler doesnt work, outside of it works
[17:57:21] <thujone> maybe the way to fix it is to fix the aspx control rather than the javascript that it generates
[17:59:47] <thujone> xenaxon: you can wrap the contents of each <li> in a <div> that has position relatvie
[17:59:52] <Qtax> there probably is some workaround, but why does this change in the first place
[18:00:50] <thujone> it's hard to speculate without something to look at
[18:02:17] <xenaxon> I can't do that
[18:02:22] <xenaxon> I'll break the markup
[18:02:26] <xenaxon> needs to be valid html5
[18:02:39] <thujone> <span>
[18:30:08] <Qtax> thujone, seems it was window.event. had to set window.event to null or the original event before the call to __doPostBack()
[19:20:19] <dblosevn_away> Hey guys, quick question
[19:20:21] <dblosevn_away> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/58
[19:21:30] <dblosevn_away> I got this doing almost everything I want it to except the for (key in path ) iterates all the items it should but there is on addtional item remove: function(a) that gets dumped to the log
[19:22:14] <StephenS> WHy does this not work on my website http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Md98w/
[19:22:18] <StephenS> I use jquery ui and such..?
[19:22:33] <dblosevn_away> can i do something like if (typeof path[key] !== 'function') ?
[19:45:10] <coaster> I'm trying to write something to choose an option from a dropdown, but the dropdown is a ul with links in li elements
[19:45:29] <coaster> so in order to make the selection, you click an a element with a rel="" attr
[19:45:38] <coaster> and that makes your selection
[19:45:50] <coaster> I want to make that selection with javascript, any ideas?
[19:46:03] <coaster> I've tried .trigger('click') and no luck
[19:47:22] <pachet> .trigger('click') implies that those elements have had click listeners assigned via $
[19:47:27] <pachet> is that the case :[
[19:47:57] <coaster> I'm not really sure
[19:48:14] <pachet> neither am i
[19:48:15] <coaster> how else could I do it if there's no listener attached?
[19:48:40] <pachet> are you just trying to bind click handlers to those li's?
[19:48:45] <pachet> disclaimer:
[19:48:48] <pachet> i've had too much to drink
[19:48:57] <coaster> no
[19:49:06] <coaster> I want to click the element
[19:49:12] <coaster> i want to simulate the mouse click
[19:49:29] <coaster> when i click with the mouse it selects in the dropdown, I want to do this in code so it is automattic
[19:49:49] <pachet> $('ul li:eq(0)').click()
[19:50:24] <coaster> whats eq
[19:50:58] <coaster> no luck with that
[19:51:14] <pachet> document.getElementsByTagName('li')[0].click()
[19:51:28] <pachet> i'm still not sure what your exact problem is
[19:51:57] <coaster> There is a dropdox on a website, with options inside
[19:52:17] <coaster> it is a ul element with li elements containing a elements
[19:52:32] <coaster> the a elements trigger something when clicked, that then makes the selection
[19:52:37] <coaster> does that make any sense?
[19:54:25] <pachet> $('ul li a:eq(0)').click()
[19:54:42] <coaster> i tried that
[19:54:44] <coaster> no luck
[19:55:07] <pachet> bleh, make a fiddle
[19:58:24] <coaster> thanks for the suggestions, pachet
[20:11:04] <nesoi> so if I have a listview that's ~2000 entries long, and I want to let the user multi-select rows, what's the most efficient way? Should I add a listbox to each entry (worried that will slow everything down a lot) or put some kind of event listener on the entire <div> and then figure out what was touched? (this is for a mobile app)
[20:33:05] <nesoi> if I have something like $('#contactList').tap(function() {selectContact()}); and contactList is a listview UL how do I find the ID of the LI which was tapped? What's the right way to reference it?
[20:34:15] <nesoi> or is there not a way to do that?
[20:37:12] <pachet> $('#contactList li').tap(function ( e ) { console.log(this.id); });
[20:39:18] <nesoi> thanks pachet. so the ID would be $('#contactList li').tap.id? I tried this.id from within the selectContact function which was fired by the above code, but it was undefined
[20:41:52] <pachet> no, you'd do it outside that call
[20:41:57] <nesoi> pachet: hmm.. I tried $('#contactList li').tap but it didn't work. $('#contactList').tap worked, but this.id was undefined
[20:44:25] <nesoi> hm. $('#contactList').tap returns "contactlist" as the id!
[20:44:32] <nesoi> how do I get the ID of what was tapped?
[20:44:42] <pachet> nesoi : try $('#contactList').tap(function ( e ) { console.log(e.target.id); })
[20:46:36] <nesoi> hm... that's not undefined, but it's not returning any value
[20:48:26] <nesoi> wait, that could be another problem :)
[20:49:24] <nesoi> yay! working! thanks pachet!!
[20:51:25] <pachet> yw :]
[20:52:29] <nesoi> hmm... so in a listview, how would I change the color of the row to show it was selected (via this tap event)?
[21:27:58] <NeedAlittleHelp> hey there, created a little animation but having a brainfart, can't figure out how to stop the recursive function on mouseout http://jsfiddle.net/3xgWy/
[21:32:51] <zack> hi
[21:46:29] <nesoi> I know this is lame, but how do I figure out the color of an LI in a listview using data-theme a?
[21:51:30] <nesoi> nevermind :)
[22:04:03] <nesoi> hmm... what would make a footer not show up?
[22:15:38] <dblosevn> nesoi: display: none; :-)
[22:16:07] <Gowthaman> hi
[22:16:15] <dblosevn> nesoi: without the context of your issue thats the best I can come up with
[22:16:32] <Gowthaman> i want user manul for jquery
[22:16:48] <dblosevn> ?g jquery api @ Gowthaman
[22:16:48] <b-ot> Gowthaman: malarvizhi gowthaman - India | LinkedIn â†’ http://in.linkedin.com/pub/malarvizhi-gowthaman/56/bba/263
[22:16:55] <dblosevn> nope lol
[22:17:22] <dblosevn> Gowthaman: http://api.jquery.com/
[22:17:48] <Gowthaman> i want downloadable link
[22:17:55] <dblosevn> good luck
[22:18:20] <dblosevn> I have never seen a downloadable jquery api reference
[22:20:34] <nesoi> dblosevn : it seems to be getting pushed off the page on the bottom (jquery mobile).
[22:20:50] <dblosevn> content too tall?
[22:20:56] <dblosevn> or wide for that matter
[22:21:08] <nesoi> dblosevn : looks too tall... how would I make it fit?
[22:21:17] <nesoi> it's a header and a listview and a footer
[22:21:22] <dblosevn> make the content shorter :-)
[22:21:37] <dblosevn> add scrolling to the listview
[22:21:45] <dblosevn> set a max-height
[22:21:56] <nesoi> hmm... ok, thanks
[22:22:51] <dblosevn> I had a hell of a time with this in the past
[22:23:15] <nesoi> dblosevn : I don't see a way to set a max-height or to turn on or off scrolling... it does already scroll
[22:23:23] <dblosevn> when you want the header and footer to always be displayed and the content to take up the remaining vertical pace
[22:23:35] <dblosevn> *space
[22:23:35] <nesoi> dblosevn : how did you solve it?
[22:24:13] <dblosevn> a lot of heartache, let me see if ica n find that project, it was my first and last jqm project ever
[22:24:47] <nesoi> heh, thanks
[22:25:30] <dblosevn> im pretty sure i recalculated the height of content after render
[22:26:21] <dblosevn> device-height - header-height - footer-height = content-height
[22:27:23] <dblosevn> assuming no padding or margins
[22:27:38] <nesoi> hmm :)
[22:28:29] <dblosevn> there should be a data-role for this interface type as it is quite common to emulate a native app
[22:31:03] <nesoi> hmm
[22:31:04] <dblosevn> ?g jquery mobile freeze header and footer and expand content to fill height @ nesoi
[22:31:05] <b-ot> nesoi: Sorry, no results for â€Ÿjquery mobile freeze header and footer and expand content to fill height @ nesoiâ€.
[22:31:26] <dblosevn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7445977/jquery-mobile-content-area-100-height-between-head-and-foot
[22:31:31] <nesoi> is there only one data-role="content" on a page or can you have more than one?
[22:31:46] <dblosevn> looks like that has been solved
[22:32:02] <nesoi> I actually just tried the answer rated 5 and it didn't work
[22:32:37] <dblosevn> hmm
[22:33:22] <dblosevn> i was experimenting with jqm and phonegap at the time
[22:33:37] <nesoi> yeah, that's what I'm doing
[22:33:47] <dblosevn> didnt really like the outcome so i decided never to do it again
[22:33:53] <nesoi> the code from the rated 5 answer actually crashes my app
[22:34:03] <dblosevn> awesome
[22:34:27] <dblosevn> um
[22:34:36] <dblosevn> what version of jquery you using
[22:34:45] <dblosevn> .delegate has been depreciated
[22:35:00] <nesoi> dblosevn : latest
[22:35:02] <dblosevn> probally why its crashing
[22:35:07] <nesoi> ah
[22:35:13] <dblosevn> rewrite the delegate to use .on
[22:35:13] <nesoi> so what's the alternative?
[22:35:24] <nesoi> just search/replace delegate with on?
[22:35:25] <dblosevn> ? jquery.on @ nesoi
[22:35:27] <bot-t> nesoi, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:35:56] <nesoi> so is there only one data-role="content" on a page or can you have more than one?
[22:36:12] <dblosevn> or load jquery.migrate and test to see if it works with delegate first
[22:36:38] <nesoi> .on didn't crash, but also didn't do anything
[22:37:05] <dblosevn> well the arg order changed
[22:37:08] <dblosevn> read the doc
[22:38:06] <dblosevn> .on doesnt work the same way as delegate did
[22:38:20] <dblosevn> doesnt do the exact same thing either
[22:38:42] <dblosevn> events no longer "have" to bubble up to document now
[22:39:54] <nesoi> hm. trying migrate
[22:40:02] <nesoi> nope that didn't work either
[22:40:26] <nesoi> what about data-role="content" - only one per page? or can you have a few?
[22:40:42] <dblosevn> try $(document).on('pageshow', #page_name', function () {
[22:41:14] <dblosevn> pretty sure only one data-role="content" per page
[22:41:34] <dblosevn> also i nthat example I think #page_name has to be the id of your page
[22:44:43] <nesoi> hm. none of that seems to make any difference at all
[22:44:55] <dblosevn> ?demo @ nesoi
[22:44:55] <b-ot> nesoi: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:45:53] <nesoi> dblosevn : I don't think I can because this is using android contacts retrieved by a phonegap navigator function
[22:47:09] <dblosevn> hmm, just grab the html and dump it into a fiddle, put dummy data in for the list data
[22:52:28] <nesoi> just the html?
[22:55:04] <dblosevn> ya, make it half way work and say my name when your ready so it pops up and lets me know i got a message
[22:56:31] <nesoi> I don't think it will work at all with no content
[22:58:08] <nesoi> dblosevn : cool, I found some code that worked!
[22:58:25] <dblosevn> sweet
[22:58:25] <nesoi> the last comment on this page https://forum.jquery.com/topic/filling-the-visible-content-area
[22:59:19] <dblosevn> nesoi: think thats exacly what i told you an hour ago lmao
[22:59:46] <nesoi> dblosevn : is it?  it's different from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7445977/jquery-mobile-content-area-100-height-between-head-and-foot
[23:00:27] <dblosevn> content-height = device-height - header-height - footer-height
[23:00:39] <nesoi> oh right
[23:00:54] <nesoi> I didn't know how to do it though, and that code did it :)
[23:00:55] <dblosevn> that function just factors in padding and margins as well
[23:01:38] <nesoi> right!
[23:02:16] <dblosevn> nesoi: keep in mind bind has been depreciated
[23:02:26] <dblosevn> a few versions back
[23:02:28] <nesoi> oh nooo
[23:02:36] <nesoi> what do you use instead?
[23:02:39] <dblosevn> .on
[23:03:06] <dblosevn> .on took the place of quite a few methods
[23:03:23] <dblosevn> .delegate, .bind, .live just to name a few
[23:03:33] <nesoi> other things like .keyup .tap, etc. are still ok though?
[23:03:48] <dblosevn> ya they should be mapped to use .on internally
[23:04:20] <nesoi> is it a problem to use .migrate and .bind for now? slows things down?
[23:05:33] <dblosevn> you should try to never use depreciated functions as there is no telling when/if they will actually be removed, case in point .delegate crashed your app
[23:06:28] <dblosevn> im pretty sure itunes will deny your app if it uses depreciated methods as well so keep that in mind if your planning to submit to itunes
[23:07:31] <nesoi> I'm doing android first. assuming I get anything done at all :)
[23:09:02] <nesoi> so dblosevn while I have your attention... how do I control how much padding there is between the listview and the edge of the screen? I had it as its own role=content and it was going to the edges, but now that I nested it within a an ourter data=content div it is too narrow
[23:09:35] <dblosevn> paste me your layout
[23:11:06] <nesoi> dblosevn : sorry I pasted it as an msg
[23:11:14] <nesoi> https://gist.github.com/rlad/5981ec0dec56e0291c0f
[23:11:19] <dblosevn> i got it
[23:11:28] <dblosevn> my autoresponder got you lol
[23:11:36] <nesoi> the inner ul is narrower than I wish it was :)
[23:13:02] <dblosevn> nesoi: is the scroll div wide enough?
[23:13:16] <dblosevn> or is the ul the same width as the scroller
[23:14:27] <nesoi> hmm... I don't know what's too narrow. The only evidence I have of width is what the listview looks like
[23:14:30] <nesoi> and it's a bit too narrow
[23:14:57] <nesoi> if I take zcontent out of the csearch  div and make it also data-role="content" it is full width
[23:15:46] <dblosevn> but breaks the height
[23:16:29] <nesoi> yeah
[23:17:28] <dblosevn> try that
[23:17:29] <dblosevn> $('#zcontent').width($('#cSearch').width());
[23:17:50] <nesoi> hm... makes sense! thanks...
[23:17:52] <dblosevn> in your resize litenser
[23:18:46] <dblosevn> im pretty sure your ul is expanding to full width properly and its the scroll div thats too narrow
[23:19:15] <nesoi> hmm.. you woulda thought that would fix it, but there was no difference!
[23:19:27] <dblosevn> well minor change
[23:19:53] <dblosevn> $('#zcontent, #zcontent ul').width($('#cSearch').width());
[23:21:53] <nesoi> hmm... I think that actually made it narrower on the right!
[23:22:25] <dblosevn> $('#zcontent, #zcontent ul').css('width', '100%');
[23:22:27] <dblosevn> lmao
[23:23:03] <nesoi> yeah!
[23:23:13] <dblosevn> worked?
[23:23:25] <nesoi> dunno yet
[23:24:04] <nesoi> oddly enough, no change!
[23:24:46] <dblosevn> $('#zcontent, #zcontent ul').css('width', '100%').css('margin-left, 0).css('margin-right', 0);
[23:24:51] <dblosevn> double lmao
[23:26:47] <nesoi> stubborn ain't it?
[23:26:55] <nesoi> ah! that worked!
[23:26:57] <nesoi> thanks!
[23:27:04] <dblosevn> np
[23:27:11] <nesoi> oops
[23:27:14] <nesoi> what didn't work was
[23:27:24] <nesoi> if I empty the listview
[23:27:39] <nesoi> the footer doesn't stay at the bottom!
[23:27:39] <dblosevn> try this
[23:27:48] <dblosevn> oh
[23:27:59] <nesoi> hm. I think I did something else though
[23:28:09] <nesoi> I was trying to empty this scrollz thingy I'm using for lazy loading
[23:28:18] <nesoi> and it apparently doesn't like being emptied
[23:28:21] <dblosevn> oh that wont work lol
[23:28:28] <dblosevn> you need to clear the list
[23:28:53] <nesoi> the problem is, if I empty the listview, this scrollz thing still displays a thing which says "pull to refresh" and if it's pulled it somehow has cached the last stuff loaded and displays it
[23:29:11] <dblosevn> most likely scrollz cant be empty
[23:29:34] <nesoi> oh wait
[23:29:36] <dblosevn> clear it by $('#scrollz').html('&nbsp;')
[23:29:43] <nesoi> if I empty a div, I clear out everything including the listview
[23:29:48] <nesoi> which is in it
[23:29:50] <dblosevn> ya
[23:29:54] <nesoi> so then it won't work :)
[23:29:56] <nesoi> heh
[23:29:56] <dblosevn> thats what i said earlier
[23:30:03] <nesoi> right but I didn't understand what you meant
[23:30:29] <nesoi> any idea how I would get rid of the "pull to refresh" thingy that it has?
[23:30:38] <dblosevn> $('#scrollz ul').html('');
[23:30:54] <dblosevn> which isnt really right
[23:30:57] <nesoi> I need to use lazy loading because 2000 or whatever android contacts take a long long time to load in jquery mobile
[23:31:07] <dblosevn> the listview has to have an option to clear the list the right way
[23:31:28] <nesoi> I can clear the listview, but the scrollz thingy I don't know about
[23:31:33] <dblosevn> isnt there a buffered listview?
[23:31:47] <nesoi> not that I know of
[23:32:02] <dblosevn> basically like infinite scroll
[23:32:09] <opus_> is there a cheat sheet that would be useful?
[23:32:32] <dblosevn> opus_: id bet there are a ton of them
[23:32:42] <opus_> yeah, but they are kind of outdated.
[23:32:45] <nesoi> dblosevn : I didn't find one, which is why I looked and came up with this  https://github.com/zippy1978/jquery.scrollz
[23:34:05] <dblosevn> opus_: i dont know what the context of this cheat sheet you are looking for is so i answered with as vague of a response as the question
[23:37:25] <opus_> thanks

[23:38:14] <nesoi> dblosevn : ugh, that on resize thing isn't actually working because if the keyboard pops up, it sees that as a resize event and tries to put the footer above the keyboard, then when the keyboard goes away it doesn't resize it properly
[23:38:45] <dblosevn> appears to be able to extend the listview
[23:39:58] <nesoi> hm... much more complicated than the one I'm using, but maybe it would work better?
[23:40:28] <dblosevn> most likely, being it can turn the listview into a buffered listview
[23:40:29] <nesoi> and the 1st bug seems problematic :)
[23:42:36] <dblosevn> ya just a little but nothing that cant be solved
[23:43:10] <dblosevn> add a dummy item in the list first after the lazy loader loads the first time remove it
[23:43:45] <nesoi> the issue is what happens when the user is searching and they enter a string that's not found, then dismiss the keyboard
[23:45:38] <dblosevn> maybe wrap your resize listener in a timeout of like 500ms
[23:46:02] <dblosevn> im thinking resize is being fired to early when the keyboard is going away
[23:46:19] <nesoi> it's fired when the keyboard appears actually
[23:46:27] <nesoi> so I just took that code out of resize
[23:46:34] <nesoi> then I can rezize only if orientation changes
[23:46:35] <dblosevn> or if the keyboard collapsing is animated then it may be a race condition
[23:46:38] <nesoi> but I'll do that later
[23:46:58] <dblosevn> ?debounce @ nesoi

[23:47:11] <NeedAlittleHelp> if sibilings have a animation via mouseover and they are right next to each other, how can I stop the animation from bubbling up if I mouseover each multiple times
[23:47:24] <NeedAlittleHelp> sorry if bad explanation, new to jquery
[23:47:27] <nesoi> dblosevn : yes, but if the keyboard appearing causes a resize, debouncing wouldn't help would it?
[23:47:49] <dblosevn> debound the resize so it only is fired on the last resize
[23:48:04] <dblosevn> im thinking theres an animation that occurs when the keyboard is displayed
[23:48:19] <dblosevn> and resize is likely being fired multiple times
[23:48:57] <dblosevn> a race condition may occur that is causing the last run on the resize handler to size the page improperly
[23:49:26] <nesoi> you don't think resize is fired when the keyboard pops up?
[23:49:41] <dblosevn> im saying i think its fired a lot as the keyboard pops up
[23:50:08] <nesoi> yes, but I don't want the footer to move up to above the keyboard!
[23:50:31] <dblosevn> then you cant handle the page size on resize
[23:50:44] <dblosevn> *content-height on resize
[23:50:53] <dblosevn> bind to pageload instate
[23:50:59] <nesoi> dblosevn: I think I can, by detecting if the resize is due to an orientation change... and only resizing when that happens
[23:51:28] <dblosevn> well in that case bind to 'pageload orientationchange'
[23:51:52] <nesoi> ah cool
[23:51:53] <nesoi> thanks
[23:53:54] <dblosevn> i guess NeedAlittleHelp didnt need a little help
[23:54:07] <nesoi> :)
[23:54:10] <dblosevn> just went to try to respond to him and boom he quit lmao
[23:54:24] <nesoi> hmm... pageload orientationchange didn't seem to work
[23:54:34] <dblosevn> i might have spelled it wrong
[23:54:36] <dblosevn> lol
[23:54:42] <nesoi> heh
[23:55:12] <dblosevn> its pageshow not pageload
[23:56:10] <nesoi> not just orientationchange?
[23:56:11] <dblosevn> so 'pageshow orientationchange'
[23:56:35] <dblosevn> well the orientation wont change when the page is first loaded unless they rotate there device
[23:56:45] <nesoi> hm. that didn't work either.....
[23:57:50] <nesoi> heh, if I just use orientationchange it kind of works, but not really
[23:57:57] <nesoi> what happens is, it displays properly at first
[23:58:07] <dblosevn> houldnt
[23:58:08] <nesoi> but if I turn it sideways it doesn't put the footer at the bottom but then
[23:58:26] <nesoi> if I turn it portrait again, the footer is just below where it would have been in landscape!
[23:58:28] <dblosevn> it should display wrong at first then display right when you change orientation
[23:58:41] <nesoi> I'm also doing $(window).trigger('orientationchange');
[23:58:53] <nesoi> right under end of the bind function
[23:58:53] <dblosevn> nasty
[23:59:10] <nesoi> oh? should I do something else to get the code to run the 1st time?
[23:59:25] <nesoi> it's not running correctly anyway though
[23:59:45] <dblosevn> $(window).on ('pageshow orientationchange',function(event){
