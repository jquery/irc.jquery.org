[00:00:09] <phrearch> heh yea :)
[00:00:26] <phrearch> gladly i have my nickserv authentication automated :)
[00:03:52] <mazzachre> wkmanire: I would say at least a handfull of places by a handful of developers... There will be a few slight changes to what is should do on some events...
[00:05:36] <wkmanire> mazzachre: What you might want to consider is providng default implementations for those ajax methods
[00:05:41] <wkmanire> but allow them to be easily overridden.
[00:13:07] <mazzachre> wkmanire: Ya, that is probably the best solution... Do I implement these functions in the options object?
[00:14:21] <wkmanire> mazzachre: Thats a matter of personal taste
[00:14:31] <wkmanire> If the widget is relatively small in length that'd probably be ok.
[00:14:48] <wkmanire> But if it will be a few hundred lines of code it would probably be better to do it in the object definition.
[00:21:43] <mazzachre> wkmanire: Well, the functions that I use to transfer data is fairly small...
[00:22:05] <wkmanire> jQuery does most of the work.
[00:22:13] <wkmanire> Are you using JSON or XML?
[00:23:05] <mazzachre> JSON
[00:24:29] <mazzachre> Basically I would supply the object that needs to be send, but I then need a way to put the response into the widget and make it redraw with this new data...
[00:25:02] <wkmanire> Have you looked at backbone.js?
[00:25:09] <wkmanire> It helps with those sort of organizational issues.
[00:25:54] <nkuttler> anybody familiar with ui autocomplete/(position/widget)? the autocomplete input field is positioned so that it's position changes when the page size changes. i kinda assume there's a function to re-position it
[00:28:05] <nkuttler> never mind, fixed through css
[00:28:41] <jomofcw> Hi there =)
[00:28:45] <wkmanire> mazzachre: Keep in mind that there is no need to use every feature of backbone.js, you can just pick the parts that you need and scale up as you go.
[00:29:01] <wkmanire> It sounds to me like you really could use a Model and a View.
[00:30:02] <athst> as opposed to a room with a view
[00:31:24] <wkmanire> athst: He he he
[00:32:37] <sean`> lo lo
[00:32:46] <aidan> I have a youtube embed with an iframe inside a carousell ... how can I stop the carousell when someone clicks play on the youtube video?
[00:33:40] <juha____> morning ppl
[00:33:43] <wkmanire> aidan: Thats going to be a hard one.
[00:35:01] <wkmanire> Juha: Good mourning.
[00:35:17] <wkmanire> aidan: I don't think flash plugin's raise events that you can handle.
[00:35:50] <wkmanire> aidan: Do you get a click event on the container of the youtube video when you click the play button?
[00:35:56] <mazzachre> wkmanire: Never looked at it... Where can I find that?
[00:36:05] <aidan> wkmanire: no :(
[00:36:10] <juha____> how's your aids, people?
[00:36:18] <aidan> wkmanire: and I imagine the cross domain policy stops me from doing anything too
[00:36:49] <wkmanire> aidan: Ok, see if you can get a mouse down event on the window.
[00:38:05] <coldhead> strong, juha____
[00:38:05] <wkmanire> mazzachre: Just do a google search for backbone.js
[00:38:08] <wkmanire> it`ll be in the first page.
[00:38:22] <coldhead> i shouldn't have a notify for aids BUT I DOOO
[00:39:29] <aidan> $(document).live('mousedown', function(event) { console.log(event); }); ...
[00:39:33] <aidan> am I doing that right?
[00:39:42] <DarsVaeda1> hi, how do I get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/7kf7p/
[00:39:56] <coldhead> looks okay, aidan
[00:39:57] <coldhead> ?tias
[00:39:58] <bot-t> Try It And See
[00:39:59] <aidan> I guess I don't need live
[00:40:08] <aidan> AH, it works if I remove the live
[00:40:16] <skylamer`> try with ready
[00:40:31] <wkmanire> coldhead: He wants to stop the carousel when the play button is clicked in an embedded flash youtube video.
[00:40:45] <coldhead> oh um, fuck that :(
[00:40:49] <wkmanire> coldhead: I'm just prodding him to experiment with different things.
[00:41:00] <coldhead> i'll leave it with you!
[00:41:02] <aidan> okay I can get the mousedown!
[00:41:02] <coldhead> good job!
[00:41:08] <wkmanire> Ok
[00:41:38] <wkmanire> If you can get the mousedown, and you know where the youtube video is then you can do a simple bounds check to find if the mouse is where the play button is.
[00:41:43] <wkmanire> Its sort of hackish and you'll really have to test it.
[00:41:55] <wkmanire> But it might just work for you.
[00:42:03] * aidan puts hacker cap on
[00:42:22] <aidan> seems reasonable to stop the carousell whenever the user clicks right?
[00:42:48] <aidan> I wonder if I can get a mouseenter on the bounding box?
[00:43:01] <wkmanire> That'd make it even easier.
[00:43:02] <wkmanire> So you'
[00:43:17] <wkmanire> You'll know ahead of time if the mouse is over the flash object when the click happens.
[00:43:49] <aidan> fuck yeah, that works.
[00:43:57] <aidan> thanks wkmanire
[00:44:06] <wkmanire> :)

[00:55:00] <wkmanire> bot-t: How many vikings have you eaten today?
[00:55:01] <bot-t> wkmanire, Yes.
[00:55:06] <wkmanire> Exactly.
[00:57:53] <coldhead> just the word "viking": could beat me in a bar fight
[00:58:30] <wkmanire> Coldhead isn't a fighter, he's a hater.
[00:58:36] <wkmanire> wait, did I get that saying wrong?

[01:00:00] <DarsVaeda1> somehow I think there is no easy way to get an form into an ajax request with jquery except than fiddling around much :(
[01:00:01] <wkmanire> Watchya drinken?
[01:00:08] <coldhead> vodka and orange
[01:00:15] <wkmanire> DarsVaeda1: You can serialize a form with jQuery
[01:00:31] <juha____> coldhead: you should check this awesome site called juha-online-bass-guitar-store.com
[01:00:33] <DarsVaeda1> but I can't use that, I need json (I guess)

[01:00:37] <wkmanire> coldhead: Screwdrivers eh? I'm sticking with the Sam Adams tonight.
[01:00:46] <coldhead> DarsVaeda1: you can use the ajax form plugin and turn a regular form into an ajax form with ONE LINE OF JS
[01:01:08] <coldhead> thanks juha____, i'll bookmark it and give you time to register the domain :D

[01:03:11] <ravenzz> not 31
[01:03:33] <gianiaz> ravenzz, but setMonth expects 11 for december
[01:03:41] <gianiaz> 0 for january
[01:03:46] <ravenzz> sure?

[01:06:27] <gianiaz> ravenzz, this seems to work
[01:06:31] <gianiaz> but why?!?!
[01:06:34] <gianiaz> :-D
[01:07:36] <RandomSort> Good morning
[01:07:38] <gianiaz> ravenz... I understood
[01:07:52] <gianiaz> we're on june, setDate to 31
[01:08:11] <RandomSort> is it allowed for a subclass's constructor to have a different method signature to that of it's superclass'?
[01:08:12] <gianiaz> set the day to 1
[01:08:22] <gianiaz> cause june has 30 days
[01:08:33] <gianiaz> I have to set the month before the day
[01:08:39] <gianiaz> argh...
[01:08:39] <ravenzz> gianiaz yup. i suppose that you have to set the Month before to use setDate
[01:08:40] <gianiaz> :-D
[01:08:45] <coldhead> and in conclusion, in every programming language, dates suck
[01:08:50] <gianiaz> LOL
[01:08:53] <ravenzz> i am agree!
[01:09:17] <ravenzz> except than php
[01:09:50] <ravenzz> strtotime is pretty nice
[01:10:19] <gianiaz> ravenzz, and I add another thought, I have to set the year before
[01:10:26] <gianiaz> for 29/02/2012
[01:12:11] <coldhead> DarsVaeda1: http://jsfiddle.net/7kf7p/12/ you serialize the form, not the inputs
[01:12:36] <coldhead> and serialize doesn't jsonify
[01:12:45] <coldhead> i think you have to write that yourself
[01:12:47] <DarsVaeda1> yeah I quite know that
[01:13:12] <coldhead> oh okay, sorry
[01:13:15] <DarsVaeda1> now i got it into an object and then get a really unobtrusive error message -.-
[01:13:25] <DarsVaeda1> I hate it *grrrrr*

[01:17:38] <DarsVaeda1> or I am doing something wrong...
[01:20:52] <RandomSort> DarsVaeda1: might the problem be that inputs is an array?
[01:21:27] <DarsVaeda1> I have no idea, it works if I build it as a plain text string json thing
[01:21:58] <coldhead> something is wrong, it keeps crashing my browser >: |
[01:22:05] <wkmanire> same
[01:22:16] <coldhead> impressive, really
[01:22:34] <DarsVaeda1> thanks I did my very best :D
[01:22:49] <coldhead> good work!
[01:25:13] <hmbg> google are such evil geniuses
[01:25:31] <DarsVaeda1> what did they do this time?
[01:25:57] <hmbg> on  my laptop, chrome is always fast. Firefox is ok, while running alone. When both run at the same time, chrome is still fast, while Firefox clogs down like it was 1995.
[01:26:17] <Peter`> Any why is that "evil"?
[01:26:18] <hmbg> I don't know how they did it, but it's clever, very clever
[01:26:38] <hmbg> to design chrome to make firefox slow
[01:26:47] <Peter`> Chrome definitely has not been designed like that
[01:26:51] <RandomSort> to design chrome as to make firefox seem slow :)
[01:26:51] <AdvoWork> is there any way i can have an ajax function to send data, but so i can do  In function1   call ajax sending function,, but return to function1 also, so i can use the returned data in function 1? at the moment my returned data is returned to the ajax call, not the function thats calling it..
[01:26:59] <DarsVaeda1> also its not made by google
[01:27:07] <Peter`> What, Chrome?
[01:27:08] <hmbg> whooosh
[01:27:14] <RandomSort> AdvoWork: it's asynchronous so most likely not
[01:27:28] <AdvoWork> RandomSort, any suggestions?
[01:27:29] <coldhead> DarsVaeda1: http://jsfiddle.net/7kf7p/17/
[01:27:42] <coldhead> $(':input', parent) seems to upset it
[01:27:51] <Peter`> DarsVaeda1: it's mostly made by Google, although there are external contributors
[01:27:52] <mynotes> hello. how to select link 1 on my menu during the page load. http://jsfiddle.net/XauzG/2/
[01:27:56] <Peter`> to Chromium, not to Chrome.
[01:28:24] <coldhead> maybe $(:'input', parent.get(0)) would fix it, but find() is fine
[01:28:28] <RandomSort> Advowork, depends on what you want to do, but you can do the same stuff in your callback function from the ajax call you can do anywhere, so you should just try to use that
[01:29:03] <DarsVaeda1> coldhead: yay this really works :)
[01:31:06] <AdvoWork> RandomSort, basically functionA() {   var customerid=123; functionB(customerid); } now in functionB)(customerid) { im doing an ajax call - inserting a record, getting the returned sequence number) and now i want/need to use that sequence number in functionA. get me?
[01:32:47] <hmbg> AdvoWork: if you describe why you want to use the return value in functionA, perhaps we help you find a way around it
[01:33:31] <hmbg> Ajax being asynchronous, trying to make it synchronous is swimming upstream
[01:33:57] <hmbg> also, that would be called sjax, which is harder to pronounce
[01:33:59] <AdvoWork> hmbg, ill do a quick example, sorry
[01:34:37] <wkmanire> AdvoWork: If you're hell bent on doing that then try using deferreds. You'll still have to refactor your functions a little bit though.
[01:34:45] <stevepiercy> I have a javascript that duplicates a table row containing text inputs, and changes the new row's inputs' names and ids by incrementing a suffix. For example name1 is duplicated and the copy is renamed name2, and so on. 1 of the inputs is a datepicker, and the other 2 are timepickers, by Keith Wood.
[01:35:26] <stevepiercy> However, when I click in the new row's timepicker and try to change the time, the first row's time changes instead
[01:36:07] <stevepiercy> can someone help me troubleshoot or understand what the problem may be?
[01:36:32] <Sid> can somebody help me with .ajaxSubmit() ???
[01:36:53] <coldhead> llololool hmbg
[01:37:11] <Sid> i have used ajaxSubmit to submit a form but everytime it is submitting the form synchronously..

[01:37:36] <os-rescue> Hi, it is possible to extract pictures from video with Jquery?
[01:38:13] <coldhead> stevepiercy: i would suggest having a hidden row that doesn't have any date or time pickers. clone THAT row as needed and add the date/time pickers upon insertion of the cloned row
[01:38:27] <coldhead> that's easier than debugging the weirdo plugin
[01:38:41] <wkmanire> os-rescue: No, but I believe with HTML5 elements and javascript you can.
[01:38:45] <coldhead> capiche?
[01:39:08] <AdvoWork> RandomSort, hmbg, wkmanire here is my example of what im trying to do pretty much: http://pastebin.com/Vz611q01   basically in the loop im looping through data, and inserting it, updating it then adding it to a table, i need to do this for x amount of elements so its not a one off

[01:42:10] <RandomSort> AdvoWork: so you want to take the return value of your ajax, call and depending on that, either call do one thing, or antoher?
[01:42:10] <stevepiercy> @coldhead i should add that there may be an arbitrary number of rows added
[01:42:14] <stevepiercy> not just one
[01:42:17] <wkmanire> AdvoWork: Well aside from following any of the advice anyone here has given you I'm not sure what else to say.
[01:42:26] <coldhead> that's okay, stevepiercy
[01:42:27] <gnarf> RandomSort: sounds like an if statement, and ajax's don't "return" they "respond"
[01:42:36] <coldhead> lemme jsfiddle you a demo, stevepiercy
[01:42:40] <hmbg> AdvoWork: my suggestion: get all the customer ids first, then in the success callback, populate the table
[01:42:48] <RandomSort> AdvoWork: So what you want to do is make a function that inserts the row, and call that in success in stead of returning the data.
[01:43:04] <gnarf> ajax doesn't RETURN it RESPONDS
[01:43:10] <hmbg> AdvoWork: it also looks hugely expensive to do one request per customer id
[01:43:11] <gnarf> ;)
[01:43:12] <RandomSort> AdvoWork: and then in error call another function that handles the error, rather than handling the error in the functino that calls
[01:43:24] <RandomSort> gnarf: I'm not disagreeing with you
[01:43:26] <gnarf> error
[01:43:28] <gnarf> error
[01:43:37] <RandomSort> I'm just trying to coerce it in the right direction one step at a time
[01:43:45] <hmbg> AdvoWork: that should be "get all the sort options for all customer ids first..."
[01:43:48] <gnarf> AdvoWork: are you using 1.5 or 1.6?
[01:44:31] <gnarf> AdvoWork: are you trying to advocate for work?
[01:44:40] <gnarf> ?ud advocate
[01:44:45] <bot-t> gnarf, Advocate - One who speaks on behalf of another. Offer support or to take ones place.
[01:44:45] <Sid> Hi..<coldhead>   , u can check the code at http://jsfiddle.net/47mL4/
[01:45:03] <gnarf> coldhead: i didn't know you were an html tag
[01:45:26] <gnarf> Sid: http://jsfiddle.net/47mL4/1/ fixed it
[01:45:29] <wkmanire> Maybe jQuery should throw an exception if you try to return any arguments passed into an ajax callback.
[01:45:58] <gnarf> Sid: meaning, I hit the "tidy" button
[01:45:59] <gnarf> :)
[01:46:05] <gnarf> Sid: whats your issue?
[01:46:31] <gnarf> boo document.hierarchyAdminForm.hierarchy.value
[01:47:05] <Sid> @gnarf: The problem is I have included jquery.form.js and trying to use .ajaxSubmit()....It is not submitting the form using Ajax but normally
[01:47:13] <gnarf> $("#hirearchyAdminForm input[name='hierarchy]").val()
[01:47:39] <gnarf> Sid: ajaxSubmit()
[01:47:59] <gnarf> Sid: look at the docs for jquery.form.js
[01:48:05] <Sid> @gnarf: I have tried even ajaxForm()
[01:48:22] <coldhead> stevepiercy: http://jsfiddle.net/wuhbV/
[01:48:30] <coldhead> that is a very nice demo, i am your hero
[01:48:35] <gnarf> Sid: ajaxSubmit() is the function that immediately runs an ajax request and takes ajax options
[01:48:38] <AdvoWork> gnarf, 1.5 on this one, and thanks all for the help.. as said, i will move all my stuff into the success, thats the way i was sort of expecting to go unfortunately
[01:49:05] <gnarf> AdvoWork: no!!! You don't need everything in the success... you can call functions outside of success from inside of success
[01:49:33] <gnarf> or even attach extra .success() / .done() functions... see ?jqXHR.success

[01:50:02] <stevepiercy> @coldhead, yes, i have that part already. the cloning is not the issue
[01:50:21] <coldhead> ?p @ stevepiercy
[01:50:23] <bot-t> stevepiercy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:50:26] <stevepiercy> i don't know what the correct term is
[01:50:33] <coldhead> show us the weirdness you have
[01:50:34] <wkmanire> @s are contagious.
[01:50:34] <stevepiercy> ok
[01:50:35] <stevepiercy> jas
[01:50:37] <Sid> Gnarf: I think there is a problem in reading the line .ajaxSubmit(options)
[01:50:38] <AdvoWork> gnarf, so: functionA   call ajax function - inserts record   - call functionwhatever(with the returneddata in success) then so on?
[01:50:49] <coldhead> $cloone.find('input').datePicker()
[01:50:53] <coldhead> is all i thought you would need
[01:51:12] <hmbg> AdvoWork: that would be the general paradigm yes
[01:51:52] <hmbg> AdvoWork: unless I misunderstand you, don't you need the return data to insert the record?
[01:52:09] <hmbg> AdvoWork: in that case you'd insert the record in the result callback
[01:52:46] <AdvoWork> hmbg, basically the first function call inserts a record(that insert gives me a sequence id) i then use that sequence id to do a table update, and then based on that sequence again I will add the table row, get me?
[01:52:53] <stevepiercy> hm jsfiddle does not run it correctly
[01:52:54] <stevepiercy> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw45R/
[01:53:04] <hmbg> AdvoWork: got you
[01:53:06] <gnarf> AdvoWork: you should watch danheberden's talk on deferreds
[01:53:21] <stevepiercy> it's a complicated thing that allows addition and removal of rows
[01:53:38] <stevepiercy> i removed all the time and datepicker kak as a working base example
[01:54:16] * wkmanire needs a drinking partner.
[01:54:19] <coldhead> stevepiercy: you seem to be cloning an existing row which already has datepicker
[01:54:39] <wkmanire> gnarf: That was my first suggestion, using a deferred function to continue the process.
[01:54:41] <coldhead> stevepiercy: i am suggesting you have a hidden row without any stuff bound to it
[01:54:44] <gnarf> http://vimeo.com/22687950 Slides: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#1
[01:55:03] <coldhead> stevepiercy: see the bit about :visible in my demo
[01:55:31] <stevepiercy> oh... i see what you mean. the problem i have is that i bind the time/datepickers to the displayed row
[01:55:39] <coldhead> my code handles that
[01:55:52] <coldhead> first it binds to all the existing visible stuff
[01:55:56] <coldhead> NOT the hidden row
[01:56:18] <coldhead> then subsequent clones take the hidden row, clone it, bind stuff and append
[01:56:29] <gnarf> sean`: you approve?
[01:56:37] <coldhead> that way the naughty date/time pickers needs not ever know about the hidden row
[01:56:41] <coldhead> and they can't get confused
[01:56:42] <stevepiercy> aha! ok, so bind to the new row as it appears
[01:56:46] <coldhead> yes!
[01:56:53] <coldhead> that's what my demo was trying to show
[01:56:59] <coldhead> sorry i should have commented it better
[01:57:04] <coldhead> i'm pretty drunk
[01:57:09] <stevepiercy> yeah, the term bind is new to me

[02:08:19] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: you know there is a UI lib using jQuery already
[02:08:26] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: you might want to look at the widget factory
[02:08:27] * wkmanire was waiting for that.

[02:09:30] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: I'm dissatisfied with all the UI libs out there
[02:09:48] <coldhead> NuckingFuts: use flash
[02:10:09] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: jQuery-UI is top notch. What did you find lacking about it?
[02:10:21] <NuckingFuts> I want a similar set of UI elements to what I'd get in a desktop app, without the bloating of something like Sproutcore.
[02:10:29] <NuckingFuts> So I'm building my own.
[02:10:36] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: look at widgetfactory
[02:10:45] <gnarf>  The jQuery UI Widget Factory - WAT? - Slides: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[02:10:59] <gnarf> http://vimeo.com/22686559
[02:12:02] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: Did you know there is currently in the works a grid control?
[02:12:13] <NuckingFuts> Meh, not a fan
[02:12:15] <wkmanire> And soon there will be a number spinner and a menu widget as well
[02:12:46] <wkmanire> I've heard talk of the possibility of a tree widget somewhere down the line as well.
[02:12:55] <wkmanire> as well, as well.
[02:13:00] <NuckingFuts> All I want is basic UI elements.  Why must all UI libs contain nothing but buttons and calendars?
[02:13:02] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: ignore the widgets for now, look at widget factory
[02:13:18] <NuckingFuts> It seems there's no in-between
[02:13:19] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: it is really damn useful
[02:13:28] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: meh, not a fan
[02:13:58] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: hater
[02:14:04] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: at least say why
[02:14:07] <NuckingFuts> I'm gonna continue my work on my own lib
[02:14:18] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: dislike the style, and I REALLY hate jQuery UI
[02:14:23] <NuckingFuts> Worst. UI lib.  Ever.
[02:14:34] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: we hate you too
[02:14:36] <NuckingFuts> It's a pity too, jQuery is so amazing.
[02:15:16] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: There is a whole lot of refactoring going on underneath 1.9
[02:15:38] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: When you talk about basic desktop widgets, are you talking about more like .Net forms widgets or more like Java Swing widgets?
[02:15:47] <wkmanire> In design pattern that is.
[02:16:16] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: As far as results, I want something with similar common patterns to an iPhone app, with the addition of frames
[02:16:47] <wkmanire> I haven't done any work with iPhones, thats Objective C and Cocoa right?
[02:16:48] <NuckingFuts> jQuery UI is everything I hate in a UI lib.  Replacements for native elements (buttons and whatnot), and over-specific UI elements (does it have a calendar?), and not much in-between
[02:16:49] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: you research mobile framework yet?
[02:17:13] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: It's Obj-C (that ugly mofo)
[02:17:15] <_ramo> hi
[02:17:17] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: huh?
[02:17:23] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: jquerymobile
[02:17:29] <_ramo> how can i implement, that a link with a class is opened in a new tab or in a pop up?
[02:17:31] <NuckingFuts> Well, I'm not coding for a mobile
[02:17:43] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/forms/index.html
[02:17:46] <NuckingFuts> I'm just talking about having similar capabilities, namely the list things
[02:17:54] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/lists/index.html
[02:18:20] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/lists/lists-divider.html
[02:18:25] <NuckingFuts> I know there's lots of UI libs, but I don't think there's any quite how I want
[02:18:39] <inumedia> I'm having a weird issue with the animate function.  When I do a slidedown, the elements after it ( lower down ) is supposed to get pushed down.  And they do.  But it looks kind-of laggy.  Does anyone know a fix for this?
[02:18:42] <NuckingFuts> I looked at SproutCore, and it was TEMPTING, but it was too bloated for my tastes.
[02:19:16] <NuckingFuts> Other thing I hate about jQuery UI: CUSTOM THEMING
[02:19:22] <NuckingFuts> That made me RAAAAAEEEEEEG
[02:19:35] <NuckingFuts> I believe a UI lib should provide me with a UI and nothing more
[02:19:47] <NuckingFuts> I want it to provide the BASICS
[02:19:50] <NuckingFuts> And I'll do the CSS
[02:20:23] <gnarf> the CSS is like 80% of the UI elements, and the classes are overridable in code
[02:20:51] <wkmanire> There are just a few ui classes. ui-widget, ui-widget-header, ui-widget-content I believe.
[02:20:56] <wkmanire> and some helpers
[02:20:56] <gnarf> at least as far as the average consumer of UI libraries is concerned
[02:21:02] <gnarf> wkmanire: and the states
[02:21:05] <gnarf> wkmanire: and the icons
[02:21:06] <wkmanire> Right
[02:21:11] <wkmanire> Some of the widgets have their own classes as well.

[02:21:19] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: The majority of people seem to like what jQuery has going on. Sorry to hear that won't work for you.
[02:21:25] <wkmanire> You might want to look at microjs.com
[02:21:33] <wkmanire> there are a ton of mini libraries there you can pull ideas from
[02:21:37] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: I like jQuery
[02:21:39] <NuckingFuts> I use it
[02:21:46] <wkmanire> Hopefully you can find some stuff that will keep you from reinventing the wheel more than you hav eto.
[02:21:48] <gnarf> NuckingFuts is a hater
[02:21:49] <NuckingFuts> Actually, no.  I LOVE jQuery
[02:21:56] <gnarf> let him hate
[02:21:57] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: A man of a extremes.
[02:22:02] <NuckingFuts> I just cannot stand all these bloated UI libs
[02:22:08] <m4rtijn> hi all
[02:22:09] <gnarf> haters wanna hate, lovers wanna love, i don't even want none of the above....
[02:22:21] <NuckingFuts> We have bloated UI libs and we have crippled UI libs, but nothing in-between.
[02:22:26] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: lemme know when yours bloats
[02:22:27] <wkmanire> coldhead: You still drunk?
[02:22:31] <NuckingFuts> It goes straight from jQuery UI to Sproutcore :V
[02:22:43] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: I'm too lazy to make it bloat
[02:23:00] <gnarf> then good luck
[02:23:09] <NuckingFuts> I've vowed not to write any CSS more than what's needed to make it a UI element.
[02:23:11] <gnarf> enjoy the experience
[02:23:20] <NuckingFuts> Other than that, it'll be black squares
[02:23:21] <NuckingFuts> :P
[02:23:31] <wkmanire> Maybe you would like Closure Library
[02:23:34] <inumedia> Anyone? o_o
[02:23:36] <wkmanire> They really do give you very little.
[02:23:46] <gnarf> ?pe @inumedia
[02:23:46] <bot-t> inumedia, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[02:23:46] <stevepiercy> coldhead, i think i got it working again with the timepickers, thanks to your idea. i basically moved the timepicker within my table row cloning script
[02:23:54] <stevepiercy> thank you, kind drunk sir
[02:24:31] <wkmanire> And their optimizing compiler cuts out dead code, so dead code doesn't go to production.
[02:24:35] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: I've already said I'm quite happy with jQuery >_>
[02:24:54] <NuckingFuts> I'm just building my own UI lib around it
[02:25:00] <m4rtijn> I have the following code: http://www.pastie.org/2046868  -- if I check the firebug 'response' it looks like a nice json array.. but if I check msg the json array is wrapped in " -- " .. should I use the jqXHR instead of msg.. or what am i doing wrong??
[02:25:05] <NuckingFuts> Becuase I am not happy with the current crap.
[02:25:33] <wkmanire> I'm just tired of seeing library after library after library. It seems like half of Javascript Weekly's content is introducing new libraries.
[02:25:48] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: lemme know when your library gets released, and I'll be sure to flame it
[02:25:52] <wkmanire> I want to see more energy devoted to improving what we have.
[02:26:05] <gnarf> wkmanire: its all about approach
[02:26:08] <gnarf> everyone has theirs
[02:26:38] <blackspotwiggins> NuckingFuts, just strip out all the css you don't need from jqueryui, sounds easier than creating a new one from scratch
[02:26:53] <DarsVaeda1> is there a "shortcut" for:  $.someFunction( function() {} ); -> the function() {} part?
[02:27:05] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: i doubt it has most of the elements he is looking for
[02:27:21] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: Meh, I don't contribute to big projects, I make them :P
[02:27:41] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: selfish hater
[02:27:44] <NuckingFuts> And progress comes from replacement
[02:27:47] <blackspotwiggins> Darsain, function MYNAME() {}, $.something(MYNAME)
[02:27:58] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: I'm sure your talents would be put to good use on one of these open source projects.
[02:28:29] <wkmanire> Then we could all benefit from your foresight.
[02:28:34] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: Not my coding styles.  I have comments that talk about rubbing feces on my screen.  Might be considered unprofessional.
[02:28:39] <NuckingFuts> :P
[02:29:02] <wkmanire> So if you aren't a social coder why even bother logging into the IRC to announce your new UI library?
[02:29:09] <wkmanire> I don't mean to start trouble, but your statements beg the question.
[02:29:16] <gnarf> wkmanire: its called "trolling"
[02:29:19] <NuckingFuts> "OH GOD WHY DID YOU RUB FECES ON YOUR SCREEN? Wait... This is your code.  Damn, that's UGLY."
[02:29:28] <NuckingFuts> I'm a social person and a lonesome coder
[02:29:35] <NuckingFuts> Well, actually, I'm a social coder too

[02:32:37] <bot-t> wkmanire, #5553 (What is 'context' , in the context of jQuery ?) ñ jQuery ... - Opened 19 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5553
[02:32:40] <m4rtijn> I noticed using the jqXHR doesnt change a thing
[02:32:53] <m4rtijn> but why is my json array wrapped in ""
[02:33:10] <coldhead> DarsVaeda1: take a look at coffeescript for an alternative way to declare funcions
[02:34:15] <inumedia> gnarf: Nevermind I fixed the issue.  :P
[02:34:18] <gnarf> quentin: I'd probably use two divs on top of each other with background images representing stars, and potentially try to use ?Slider
[02:34:19] <bot-t> quentin, UI/API/1.8/Slider - The jQuery UI Slider plugin makes selected elements into sliders. There are various options such as multiple handles, and ranges. The handle can be moved with the mouse or the arrow keys. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
[02:34:50] <DarsVaeda1> coldhead: ah not thats not...but...I like how the coffeescript site does the scrolling thing at the top
[02:34:51] <DarsVaeda1> neat
[02:35:03] <wkmanire> coffeescript is pretty. It gives me a sense of vicarious deja-vu. Like when assembler programmers first started hacking in C, how they felt guilty about not writing some or all of the app with a magnet and a steady hand.
[02:35:18] <dqminh> m4rtijn, if you expect JSON back, your dataType should be json
[02:36:06] <wkmanire> gnarf: Huh, thats a good idea.
[02:36:17] * m4rtijn slaps himself on the forehead :p
[02:36:23] <m4rtijn> thanks dqminh
[02:36:30] * wkmanire files gnarf's idea under N for gnarf.
[02:36:32] <NuckingFuts> coffeescript makes me wanna vomit
[02:36:43] <NuckingFuts> Then again, I love JS
[02:36:46] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: stop hatin
[02:36:58] <NuckingFuts> I assume the same thing happened when ASM guys moved to C
[02:37:00] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: we only hate IE around here
[02:37:24] <gnarf> free hugs!
[02:37:27] * gnarf hugs NuckingFuts
[02:37:31] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[02:37:31] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: I don't hate IE, I just pretend it doesn't exist.
[02:37:31] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[02:37:40] <quentin> bot-t, gnarf thanks, I will check this out
[02:37:42] <bot-t> quentin, Wednesday, 2011-05-18 - http://services.jquery.com/#jqueryui-dev_20110518.log.html
[02:37:59] <coldhead> i also hate gypsies
[02:38:07] <NuckingFuts> What about Mootools?  Do you guys hate them? :P
[02:38:09] <gnarf> coldhead is a hater too
[02:38:12] <wkmanire> We're always going to have to deal with the older antiquated browsers like IE 9.
[02:38:14] * NuckingFuts used to work in mootools
[02:38:15] <wkmanire> Just a fact of life.
[02:38:15] <DarsVaeda1> but what about them gypsie-fish?
[02:38:21] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: nope, they make jsFiddle awesome
[02:38:25] <NuckingFuts> Then I moved to jQuery :D
[02:38:32] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: lolwat?
[02:38:33] <gnarf> I've never used it
[02:38:37] <coldhead> i hate mootools
[02:38:39] <NuckingFuts> jsFiddle has jQuery
[02:38:42] <coldhead> and gypsy fish
[02:38:43] <NuckingFuts> Mootools is pretty hideous
[02:38:59] <DarsVaeda1> no way anyone would hate gypsy fish!
[02:39:03] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: you need some yay in your life
[02:39:05] <NuckingFuts> Bloated and crippled, like a UI lib
[02:39:07] <gnarf> http://yayquery.com
[02:39:19] <coldhead> A WHOLE LOT OF YAY AND A QUERY TOO
[02:39:32] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: I should make my loaders use the 8========B progress bars, huh?

[02:40:37] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: dude, it has dolphins
[02:40:39] <KingDosser> Is there a way to catch any <a> and prevent it from changing page?
[02:40:41] <gnarf> hiding in the corner
[02:40:41] <coldhead> i have been reading this interview with ableson ALL DAY and i am only half way through
[02:40:49] <coldhead> abelson*
[02:40:49] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: JPEGS of DOLPHINS!

[02:40:58] <NuckingFuts> PNG 4 LIFE
[02:41:03] <gnarf> NuckingFuts: hater
[02:41:08] <wkmanire> ?preventDefault
[02:41:09] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:41:20] <gnarf> bot-t: is NuckingFuts a hater?
[02:41:20] <bot-t> gnarf, My reply is no.
[02:41:29] <gnarf> damn
[02:41:30] * NuckingFuts hugs bot-t
[02:41:31] * bot-t hugs NuckingFuts back
[02:41:33] <gnarf> gotta find a new name
[02:41:37] <wkmanire> KingDosser: $("a").click(function (event) { event.preventDefault() });
[02:41:37] <NuckingFuts> lol
[02:41:51] <gnarf> ?ud hater
[02:41:57] <KingDosser> wkmanire: Cheers, didn't know the same could be possible for anchors :)
[02:42:06] <bot-t> gnarf, hater - A person that simply cannot be happy for another person's success. So rather than be happy they make a point of exposing a flaw in that person. Hating, the result of being a hater, is not exactly jealousy. The hater doesnt really want to be the person he or she hates, rather the hater wants to knock somelse down a notch.
[02:42:06] <NuckingFuts> lol bot-t is a big slow, isn't it?
[02:42:24] <wkmanire> ?diphalia
[02:42:26] <bot-t> wkmanire, Couldn't find "diphalia" in jQuery Docs.
[02:42:29] <NuckingFuts> :lmao:
[02:42:31] <wkmanire> Thats a good thing.
[02:42:35] <NuckingFuts> Wait, this isn't dAmn
[02:42:39] <rbrtw> I'm looking for a plugin to implement a simple product selector like http://ieselect.moxa.com/
[02:42:42] <NuckingFuts> Damnit, deviantART, you spoil me.
[02:43:07] <gouri> hi
[02:43:13] <gnarf> gouri: o hai!
[02:43:14] <wkmanire> rbrtw: That is going to be a series of widgets.
[02:43:27] <wkmanire> rbrtw: Unfortunately there will not be one single plugin you can put in a page to do all of that.
[02:44:25] <wkmanire> Dammit! I ate all my chicken. I knew that was gonna happen.
[02:44:26] <wkmanire> :(
[02:45:11] <wkmanire> gouri the monosyllabic orator.
[02:46:17] <pif> hi, is there a way to easily reset all form elements for their defaut value?
[02:46:44] <gnarf> ?mdc reset @pif
[02:46:45] <bot-t> pif, form.reset - MDC Docs - reset resets the form to its initial state. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/form.reset
[02:47:13] <pif> cool and also individual controls? (one by one)
[02:47:37] <rbrtw> wkmanire: can you recommend some widgets I should check out?
[02:47:57] <gnarf> pif: no, but it wouldn't be hard to write one
[02:48:22] <gnarf> pif: just save the default state
[02:50:24] <Wiz_KeeD> anynoe here ever used kfc file manager?
[02:50:46] <gnarf> $("form").find("input,textarea,select,button").each(function() { var e = $(this), originalValue = e.val(); e.data("restoreVal", function() { e.val( originalValue ); });
[02:51:00] <gnarf> $("input").data("restoreVal")();
[02:51:28] <gnarf> hrm
[02:51:31] <gnarf> wait
[02:51:52] <wkmanire> mmmmm sammich
[02:51:58] <coldhead> i wouldn't use a file manager that condoned cruelty to animals
[02:51:59] <gnarf> maybe $.fn.resetVal = function () { this.val( this.clone(true).val() ); }; maybe
[02:52:02] <wkmanire> rbrtw: Yes, jquery-ui
[02:52:15] <coldhead> where are you wkmanire ?
[02:52:18] <gnarf> maybe $.fn.resetVal = function () { this.val( this.clone(false, true).val() ); }; maybe

[03:11:25] <wkmanire> wookie: thats ok.
[03:11:30] <NuckingFuts> They're gonna each take a night to get me smashed
[03:11:36] <wkmanire> wookie: $( "div.wrap > h2:first" ) and so on.
[03:11:48] <coldhead> good old siblings
[03:11:50] <jrockjiggz> what do you call, a profile with it's respective network.. an account?
[03:11:53] <NuckingFuts> Sounds like fun lol
[03:12:08] <NuckingFuts> Anywho 3AM and I need sleep
[03:12:15] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: Hater and a quitter
[03:12:29] <NuckingFuts> And why does my clock go back 15 minutes every hour?
[03:12:34] <Luuxx> I'm having trouble running this script http://jsfiddle.net/m42Sa/10/ on Wordpress. it works but not te way I expect. it changes every url it seposses to exept the home url. thats changed to the page u are on
[03:12:35] <wkmanire> Using windows?
[03:12:44] <NuckingFuts> Sure am
[03:12:46] <jrockjiggz> 6:11am here ;)
[03:12:52] <NuckingFuts> 3AM here
[03:13:00] <NuckingFuts> But my clock says it's 2AM
[03:13:22] <NuckingFuts> Every so often it jumps backwards
[03:13:28] <wkmanire> Luuxx: seposses?
[03:13:36] * NuckingFuts shrugs and goes to sleep
[03:14:02] <wkmanire> Jeese, Tecate tastes like water compared to Sam Adams.
[03:14:18] <Luuxx> it should
[03:14:43] <wkmanire> Luuxx: I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
[03:16:55] <wkmanire> Yes! 6 scrolls of satisfy hunger!
[03:17:04] <wkmanire> That make half-troll very happy.
[03:22:39] <wkmanire> Alright folks, All out of beer.
[03:22:40] <wkmanire> Time to sleep.
[03:22:42] <wkmanire> goodnight.
[03:23:08] <ravenzz> bye
[03:25:07] <Luuxx> I'm having trouble running this script http://jsfiddle.net/m42Sa/10/ on Word press. It works but not the way I expect. It changes every url it should except the 'Home' url that's changed to the page u are on.
[03:27:34] <sprezzatura> http://pastebin.com/sET3CVMt I have a delete hyperlinking, which on clicking makes this call. this basically deletes the item from the list. now i how do i reload the list?
[03:27:39] <Wipp> How do I send multi dimensional array with ajax post? I need it to be var[arr][arr2]
[03:28:13] <ravenzz> Luuxx uhm why dont you try to make a QUERY and remove the protocol/domain ?
[03:28:29] <RandomSort> Wipp: maybe using json in some clever way
[03:29:34] <sprezzatura> any help?
[03:31:18] <coldhead> sprezzatura: the usual way would be to send the new data back from the server, so then $('#myList').html(response_data) would redraw the list
[03:32:11] <sprezzatura> coldhead: thanks. actually, i am using jquery with django. so the list has to be populated dynamically. cant send static html
[03:33:16] <coldhead> so... you wanna leave the list intact and just remove the deleted item?
[03:33:24] <coldhead> hard to guess without seeing the html
[03:33:26] <coldhead> soz
[03:33:42] <coldhead> THAT CLOUD LOOKS LIKE IRELAND
[03:38:53] <DarsVaeda1> how can I setup jsfiddle so it will actually run when i place a js like "object.click(soStuff)"?
[03:39:30] <sprezzatura> coldhead: one more Q : $('.delete').click(function() {  confirm("Delete this Offer? Action cannot be undone.");   --- so clicking on delete displays this alert ; how do i make the ajaz call only when the user says 'Ok'?
[03:39:44] <sprezzatura> how do i capture that? which place would that be?
[03:40:03] <Luuxx> @ravenzz its to error setsitive to use a QUERY for that.
[03:40:29] <coldhead> if (confirm('etc')) { $.post(etc) } else { somet_thing_else();}
[03:40:53] <sprezzatura> where would that go?
[03:41:03] <sprezzatura> ah. ok. got it
[03:41:43] <DarsVaeda1> http://jsfiddle.net/wNjRF/1 <- how to make the button actually work in jsfiddle?
[03:42:14] <ravenzz> Luuxx maybe something like that $('a').attr('href',$(this).attr('href').replace(/((http\/\/)?(www\.)?([^\/]))/g,''));
[03:42:21] <gnarf> DarsVaeda1: that seems to work to me
[03:42:41] <DarsVaeda1> really? i can click like mad and no alert pops up
[03:42:54] <gnarf> DarsVaeda1: did you block alerts or something?
[03:42:57] <gnarf> try console.log
[03:43:00] <gnarf> its better anyway
[03:43:28] <DarsVaeda1> oh browser restart fixed it
[03:43:53] <iman> what's the best tools for packging jquery lib and css and remove unused function and css?
[03:44:24] <Luuxx> ravenzz: Right now I have this http://jsfiddle.net/m42Sa/10/ .
[03:44:47] <gnarf> Luuxx: wth are you trying to do there?
[03:45:23] <Luuxx> replace the URL in the Wordpress header to match the domain
[03:46:19] <gnarf> Luuxx: can you just like, fix your html?
[03:46:22] <gnarf> that would be way easier
[03:47:42] <gnarf> iman: well, "remove unused" is kinda hard
[03:48:13] <Luuxx> gnarf: would be but can't. its a build in function and I'm not alouwd to alter it :(
[03:48:42] <sprezzatura> how do i pass parameteres to a onClick function?
[03:48:43] <ravenzz> Luuxx you have to convert urls from absolute path to relative?
[03:48:44] <gnarf> Luuxx: who is?
[03:48:48] <gnarf> Luuxx: make them fix your shit
[03:49:01] <iman> greg_f: u know jquery library is very coplex
[03:49:40] <greg_f> iman: i know it :)
[03:49:52] <dipser> $('a:before').css({'top':'-46px'}); how can i change the style of :before?
[03:50:28] <gnarf> iman: yet only 32k gzipped & minified
[03:50:32] <Luuxx> ravenzz: could try thanks
[03:50:45] <jrockjiggz> dipser: the style of befrore???
[03:50:51] <dipser> jooo
[03:50:58] <jrockjiggz> you are selecting before
[03:51:07] <gnarf> dipser: you change it in your cdd
[03:51:10] <gnarf> er css
[03:51:12] <dipser> yes, but i want to change before
[03:51:26] <dipser> i want to change it over jquery
[03:51:38] <jrockjiggz> use css()
[03:51:51] <dipser> how?
[03:51:56] <gnarf> a:before { top: 0; } a.omg:before { top: -46px; } --- $("a").addClass("omg")
[03:52:12] <dipser> ok thx
[03:52:16] <gnarf> you should avoid .css() unless really neccesary
[03:52:28] <gnarf> just use your stylesheet and descriptive classes
[03:52:33] <jrockjiggz> css({ top: '44px'},{ backgroundColor: 'red' },{ float: 'left' });
[03:52:43] <gnarf> css = presentation -- js = interaction
[03:52:48] <jrockjiggz> and i wrote that wrong....
[03:52:50] <jrockjiggz> i do that
[03:53:04] <dipser> thx gnarf
[03:53:07] <jrockjiggz> css({ top: '44px', backgroundColor: 'red', float: 'left' });
[03:53:17] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: you can't target the :before meta-selectors with jQuery afaik
[03:53:19] <dipser> jrockjiggz: that doesnt work
[03:53:40] <dipser> i havent thought about a class ^^
[03:53:57] <gnarf> dipser: don't ever use .css() unless you really need to :)
[03:54:30] <iman> gnarf: i think it's better to zip ang gzip jquery lib then upload it
[03:54:52] <dipser> its just for a mini site. that adds an animation
[03:55:42] <Wipp> is there a native jquery command that allows me to fetch GET param from current url?
[03:55:52] <mgt> newbie question: when using jquery to get a node like $("#nodeid") the returned object does not have an appendChild function ... why ? the element selected is of type <section> and jquery append works fine ..
[03:56:02] <gnarf> Wipp: use ?bbq
[03:56:02] <bot-t> Wipp, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[03:56:17] <gnarf> it has functions for that
[03:56:47] <gnarf> Wipp: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery.deparam.querystring
[03:57:06] <Wipp> I don't think that I'm gonna use plugin for such simple functionality
[03:57:13] <Wipp> gnarf: but thanks anyway
[03:57:30] <gnarf> Wipp: dude, its 4k minified
[03:57:44] <gnarf> Wipp: and you can probably strip it down to just .deparam / what it needs
[03:58:13] <mgt> it was [0] on the returned object ...
[04:00:11] <Luuxx> ravenzz: it wassen't the solution but thanks to thant I found the core of the problem so thanks
[04:00:47] <ravenzz> great
[04:01:41] <ravenzz> btw i think that you can use a (right) regular expression to remove that just in a row of code
[04:02:27] <Luuxx> that would be great
[04:04:01] <Luuxx> not that good in regulat expressions my self yet, so i didn't know.
[04:08:56] <Luuxx> ravenzz: I think you mean this one right ? the one you posted earlyer /((http\/\/)?(www\.)?([^\/ ]))/g
[04:09:34] <ravenzz> yes but that's wrong :[
[04:09:44] <Luuxx> k
[04:10:03] <ravenzz> try to ask to someone else or on #javascript or #posix
[04:10:16] <Luuxx> k thanks
[04:10:19] <ravenzz> i am busy right now
[04:18:19] <ravenzz> Luuxx http://jsfiddle.net/sRbpM/
[04:20:36] <ravenzz> that converts the whole links into a relative ones, if you need it to be absolute you should remove the last \/ from the regular expression
[04:27:05] <astn> hello
[04:28:53] <astn> i have several divs. in each div there is a button and another div. how do i make the the button display only its sibling div and not the other divs?
[04:29:54] <blackspotwiggins> astn, $(this).siblings("div")
[04:30:05] <blackspotwiggins> for selecting from the context of the button
[04:30:35] <astn> thats what i thought but what if the div is not a direct sibling?
[04:30:58] <astn> i mean its in other divs...
[04:32:40] <astn> maybe im not clear enoff - i want to get the div with the mutual parent div, but they are not siblings....
[04:34:26] <astn> blackspotwiggins?/
[04:34:47] <blackspotwiggins> a sec
[04:35:07] <blackspotwiggins> $(this).closest("mutualparent").find("divyouwant")
[04:36:15] <astn> tyvm
[04:36:18] <astn> ill try it
[04:37:48] <astn> gr8 it works, tyvm
[05:01:39] <seutje> print $print->print; /* this is getting confusing >_< */
[05:03:05] <blast_hardcheese> Sorry to ask such a basic question, but I'm trying having a problem finding the answer in the docs
[05:04:06] <blast_hardcheese> I'm defining a callback with .ajax(); Is there a way to pass in arguments (like event.data) in a way that will preserve the values of the variables at the time of function definition?
[05:17:34] <jeffsmykil> Is this not allowed?  $(".genericContainerTabMiddleInactive").parent().previous();
[05:17:40] <jeffsmykil> Traversing is hard mm kay?
[05:19:11] <neology> hi.. is there a way we can avoid script injection in in-place editing
[05:24:27] <neology> most of the plugins I saw succumb to entering <script>alert('hi')</script>
[05:24:42] <neology> example: http://jquery-in-place-editor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/index.html
[05:24:52] <Woet> neology: then strip those things out?
[05:25:13] <Woet> server side, of course
[05:25:17] <Woet> it doesn't matter if it's client side
[05:25:25] <Woet> it's not XSS if the user puts it there himself.
[05:26:06] <neology> yeah.. I dont want the user to run a script from my input box
[05:26:18] <Woet> neology: why not?
[05:27:36] <neology> I am giving user an option to enter a location in textfield.. that is auto populated..
[05:27:55] <neology> I made it in place editable
[05:28:04] <Woet> I was with you that far]
[05:28:39] <Woet> neology: i'm still missing the point why you want to protect against XSS client side
[05:28:55] <neology> i dont want to protect xss on client side
[05:29:03] <Woet> okay, then what is the entire problem?
[05:29:20] <neology> i just dont want the user to run scripts from input boxes..
[05:29:27] <Woet> [14:26:18] <Woet> neology: why not?
[05:29:59] <neology> it will cause my app to behave abnormally.. m not a security specialist.. don't know if it can cause some damage
[05:30:26] <Woet> i can put this in my address bar: javascript:$("body").css('background-color', 'pink');
[05:30:29] <Woet> and the background will be pink
[05:30:31] <bananabroom> is it a convention/recommended to prepend a variable name with '$' if it's a jquery object, e.g. "var $menu = $('#menu')" ?
[05:30:41] <Woet> bananabroom: no
[05:30:49] <Woet> at least, not with all the people i spoke with
[05:30:57] <erichynds> do whatever you want
[05:31:00] <Woet> and not on the jquery examples either :)
[05:31:05] <Woet> but yea, what erichynds said, it's your code
[05:31:38] <bananabroom> ok wonderful, i have seen it frequently, but it reminds me too much of php (i'm a django developer)
[05:31:39] <Woet> neology: you cannot control client side, so don't try to either
[05:32:35] <neology> Woet: the script that user enters, I read it and put it in a html div
[05:33:06] <neology> i agree that I cant control it
[05:33:16] <Woet> neology: if you're really that desperate, use .text
[05:33:24] <neology> was just confirming that if there is a way to avoid that
[05:33:27] <Woet> $("#result").text('hello there <script>alert(1)</script>');
[05:35:05] <neology> i see
[05:35:08] <neology> let me try it out
[05:35:10] <neology> thnx
[05:39:38] <JWay> how can I force a jquery ui tab container to span the whole page width so it adapts to my fluid layout?
[05:39:58] <JWay> width: 100%; does not seem to do the trick
[05:46:58] <PERECil__> de cable
[05:57:33] <dbugger> Hey guys!
[05:57:50] <Deele> hi
[05:58:07] <dbugger> I have a question. Is it worth making var $this = $(this) to improve performance, if im using it a lot?
[05:58:22] <Deele> for what?
[05:58:27] <Deele> for appends or analysis?
[05:58:40] <dbugger> I dont know. Is there a difference?
[05:58:50] <Deele> there is, for performance
[05:58:58] <dbugger> Well... tell me for each, please
[05:59:05] <Deele> wont :P
[05:59:11] <dbugger> -_-
[05:59:23] <Deele> you search by yourself, we are helpers community, not teachers :P
[05:59:23] <dbugger> ok, for appends
[05:59:50] <Deele> if you are going through array, and want to append each item to string
[06:00:01] <Deele> it is much faster to add to variable first
[06:00:09] <Deele> after lopp, append single variable
[06:00:14] <Deele> loop*
[06:00:33] <dbugger> Yeah, well. I get the idea that DOM inserts should be done all at once.
[06:00:43] <Deele> yes
[06:00:52] <alket> Hi, I want to create a simple pagination but Im having problems, how can I load a page like this:  .load(get.php?id=3)
[06:00:55] <Deele> larger chunk added = better performance
[06:01:04] <dbugger> Its more about if making $(this) computationally speaking is more costly than accessing a direct var or not
[06:01:16] <Deele> alket, server side this is client side channel
[06:01:40] <Deele> dbugger, oh, you are about var this = $(this);
[06:01:54] <Deele> its just shorter, nothing more
[06:02:02] <Deele> it is jQ object in any case
[06:02:05] <dbugger> Deele, well... i wouldnt do "var this" ... :P I would do "var $this" :P
[06:02:19] <Deele> its just name, nothing more
[06:02:43] <dbugger> my point is.... let me give you an instance
[06:03:10] <dbugger> if i have 3 operations that use  "$('.myclass')" its clear that is worth it put it inside a variable
[06:03:23] <dbugger> so im wondering if the same applies to "this"
[06:03:24] <Deele> yes
[06:03:25] <aron_> Deele: It depends where you're using "this". Inside an event handler this is an element $(this) wraps it in a jQuery instance
[06:03:55] <aron_> Deele: var $this = $(this) caches that jQuery instance in a local variable
[06:04:10] <Deele> aron_, don't tell it to me, to dbugger
[06:04:33] <aron_> Deele: You said it didn't make a difference, it does
[06:04:57] <Deele> aron_, it always depends on situation, on function, that will use it
[06:04:58] <dbugger> aron_, so you thing that is worth it putting $(this) inside a variable, if Im using it a lot?
[06:05:13] <Danielpk> Guys, sorry for off topic, but some1 already used Custom Variables with Google Analytics? I trying to set custom vars but it wont work.  My Code -> http://pastebin.com/c5uN8pRY
[06:05:15] <Deele> anything that is used a lot, should be stored in local var
[06:05:37] <aron_> Sure if you're using the result of any function multiple times it's worth storing the result locally
[06:06:21] <dbugger> Ok, thanks
[06:11:28] <dbugger> Another question about optimizing. More details in the $ selector make it faster?
[06:11:55] <dbugger> Because Ive read that some yes and some not, and I dont know which one to avoid
[06:14:25] <garbagegod> hey guys, check this script out: http://pastebin.com/q11nzM9E instead of making it expand vertically, i want to make it expand horizontally, although the code makes no mention of direction/size
[06:14:31] <garbagegod> halp :3
[06:15:11] <rajanm> Hi all, is there any method like unPreventDefault(), I didn't get it.. in my case I want to re- enable the links which has event.preventDefault() is true
[06:19:30] <oal> If I have a list of items, and one is clicked, how can I know which number in the list, that item is? 1st, 2nd 3rd...?
[06:19:51] <JKarsrud> ?defaultprevented
[06:20:13] <JKarsrud> what is up with bot-t these daus?
[06:20:27] <rajanm> garbagegod: If u want external plugin... I like this   http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/jQuery-common-accordion
[06:20:31] <hrwath> he's tired
[06:20:31] <JKarsrud> oal. click(function() { $(this).index(); })
[06:20:45] <oal> Thanks JKarsrud :)
[06:20:57] <JKarsrud> zero-based tho, but that shouldn't matter to you :)
[06:21:16] <oal> Nah, that's fine ;)
[06:21:39] <NateW> new to javascript and jquery. I have this: http://www.pasteall.org/22332/javascript currently, the divs start out with a width of 300px, after they are clicked, they change to 600px, when clicked again, they stay at 600px, what is the best way to make them shrink back to 300px?
[06:22:01] <JKarsrud> oal: "this" is always the element that triggered the event :)
[06:24:10] <JKarsrud> NateW: toggle class on click?
[06:25:04] <NateW> JKarsrud: i grabbed the code from a tutorial, I'm trying to learn jquery/js
[06:26:48] <NateW> JKarsrud: I'm guessing the best thing to do is make an if statement and if it is hidden, then have it one size, and if it's not, then another
[06:27:29] <JKarsrud> sure, or store the width in a var
[06:27:34] <JKarsrud> old width that is
[06:27:49] <JKarsrud> so that you can just reset it when it's not visible or whatever
[06:28:42] <NateW> JKarsrud: how would i check to see if it's visible?
[06:29:17] <JKarsrud> depends on how you hide it
[06:29:39] <JKarsrud> you could just check the width of it, if it's 600, then set it to 300
[06:29:47] <JKarsrud> and if it's 300, then set it to 600
[06:29:52] <JKarsrud> I don't know if you hide it or not
[06:30:13] <NateW> okay.. that should work, I'll give it a try
[06:30:40] <blackspotwiggins> class toggling is the way to go tho
[06:32:31] <garbagegod> does the direction of slideToggle() depend on the css attributes for the before/after size? or is it something else?
[06:32:33] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins: yeah, but what if you animate it=
[06:32:45] <JKarsrud> to my knowledge, toggleClass doesn't animate?
[06:32:57] <blackspotwiggins> it does with jqueryui
[06:33:11] <ryanneufeld> ?slideToggle() @ garbagegod
[06:33:15] <blackspotwiggins> or you know, use css3 transitions
[06:33:19] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins: yes, but I doubt it if NateW has jquery ui
[06:33:27] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins: damn straight!
[06:33:28] <ryanneufeld> .seen bot-t
[06:33:28] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 19 minutes and 37 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[06:33:30] <garbagegod> its a pretty easy question thats not mentioned in the api
[06:33:31] <JKarsrud> and polyfill that shit
[06:33:43] <garbagegod> its more fundamental to jqeury than slideToggle itself
[06:34:09] <blackspotwiggins> nobody lost their million bucks because some div didnt bounce/fade/stumble when it changes size
[06:34:24] <garbagegod> you're definitely not understanding me
[06:34:53] <garbagegod> if i have a div with an original width of 100x100, and then i slideToggle it to 100x500, or 500x100,
[06:34:58] <garbagegod> answered my own question. nvm
[06:35:35] <garbagegod> the answer was yes -_-
[06:36:58] <NateW> blackspotwiggins: if I could do this in css3 I'd rather do that
[06:37:48] <blackspotwiggins> you cant do .class1 { width:300px } and .class2 { width:600px } ?
[06:38:47] <NateW> animate the width i meant
[06:38:56] <garbagegod> er, you still dont get it, it probably dosent help im a n00b
[06:39:12] <garbagegod> i think i figured out my solution anyways, ty :)
[06:39:13] <blackspotwiggins> NateW, transition: all 1s;
[06:39:36] <blackspotwiggins> and with prefixes
[06:39:42] <orolo> i'm reading the fundamentals site under the "Conditionals" section.
[06:40:19] <orolo> how is this object literal lookup used?:  if (({ foo : 1, bar : 1 })[type]) { ... }
[06:40:37] <orolo> what does that ask in human?
[06:40:55] <blackspotwiggins> orolo, if type = "foo" or "bar" then it evaluates to true
[06:41:06] <blackspotwiggins> if i can read this right
[06:41:32] <orolo> hmm. what is the [type] in this instance?
[06:41:56] <blackspotwiggins> type is the key you are using on the object
[06:42:10] <blackspotwiggins> any object can be accessed with . or [] syntax
[06:42:22] <orolo> oh.
[06:42:32] <blackspotwiggins> like var a = { abc : 1 }, a["abc"]  and a.abc are equivalent
[06:43:03] <orolo> so ¬†if (({ foo : 1, bar : 1 })[bar]) { ... } would be true.
[06:43:07] <blackspotwiggins> if you need to access a value with a key that's contained in a variable, then [] is the only way
[06:43:18] <blackspotwiggins> ["bar"] actually in this case
[06:43:30] <orolo> cool. thanks.
[06:46:53] <Wizek> hi
[06:59:46] <Valantine> hi all
[07:00:08] <Valantine> why is j incremented by 2 when I click on [add question] by 2?
[07:00:08] <Valantine> http://jsfiddle.net/lonewolfs/ZM8mq/
[07:01:28] <Valantine> anyone?
[07:01:51] <seutje> any1 know of a straight forward plugin to put numbers after all links and then list em at the bottom?
[07:03:31] <jonathansampson> seutje Sounds like something a simple $.each() could handle.
[07:03:49] <seutje> yea, but I'd prefer an already written and tested each ;)
[07:04:03] <jonathansampson> Seutje, i wouldn't expect it to be more than a few lines of code :)
[07:04:17] <seutje> again, I'd prefer to use already written and tested lines
[07:04:29] <jonathansampson> You append the index of the a after it, then clone the a and place it in an ol at the bottom of the page.
[07:05:42] <seutje> something tells me the href will be more useful, considering I'm trying to make print-friendly shits :)
[07:05:53] <seutje> and I don't want the first <a> to have "0" after it ;)
[07:06:01] <phlp> Valantine: ids should be unique. your button has id="add" but the span it is in also has id="add"
[07:06:05] <jonathansampson> Seutje, fine, append the index+1 :)
[07:06:19] <seutje> :P
[07:06:29] <jonathansampson> I'm working up an example.
[07:06:31] <seutje> handling ajax shizzle is gonna be a bitch though
[07:06:44] <seutje> good, maybe we'll have it finished simultaneously
[07:07:37] <phlp> Valantine: http://jsfiddle.net/ZM8mq/1
[07:16:44] <DarsVaeda1> can I add and remove a class by selecting by class? ie "$(".class").addClass("foo");"
[07:16:52] <nbari> hi all, what is the best wayt to bulid a chat, using jquery with ajax calls or to use something like the  node.js, I like the way node.js display very fast the messages avoiding the use ajax calls, but when dealing with tons of users/chatrroms/privatemsss what would be the best way to go =
[07:17:08] <DarsVaeda1> which should add to all elements which have class "class" the class "foo"
[07:17:49] <jonathansampson> DarsVaeda1 Yes.
[07:18:03] <jonathansampson> $(".foo").addClass(".bar") will create .foo.bar
[07:18:16] <DarsVaeda1> okay thanks
[07:18:26] <jonathansampson> $.addClass("bar") actually.
[07:18:30] <DarsVaeda1> then I am doing something wrong ^^
[07:18:59] <jonathansampson> $(".foo").addClass("bar"); // is correct
[07:19:39] <Snugug> Hey all. I've got a question. I have something loading in using AJAX, but don't have control over that set of JS. I want to write a piece of code that will query my page until that JS has run then do something, can someone give me some advice?
[07:20:28] <jonathansampson> Snugug If you're loading it in asynchronously, you can place your code in the callback.
[07:20:35] <jonathansampson> It will be ran once the code as loaded.
[07:20:44] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Don't have access to that
[07:21:00] <jonathansampson> What do you mean?
[07:21:15] <Snugug> A better way to explain, I want to query a page until an element has a height, and then act once that element has a height
[07:21:17] <jonathansampson> Are you calling the function that loads the external data?
[07:21:18] <Snugug> How can i do that?
[07:21:34] <seutje> jonathansampson: where's my example? :P
[07:21:50] <jonathansampson> Seutje Haha. I've got jsbin opened up, but a million things distracting me :)
[07:21:52] <seutje> went to make a doodie, figured u'd be done by now ;)
[07:22:00] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Ignore the first question, much too vague. I want to do the second.
[07:22:06] <jonathansampson> Should have made a bigger doodie :)
[07:22:21] <seutje> I don't have all that much control over the size of my doodies
[07:22:24] <seutje> aside from diet ofc
[07:22:31] <lugzer> hi
[07:22:33] <seutje> and perhaps access to laxatives
[07:22:45] <phlp> Snugug: setInterval and check the height
[07:22:53] <jonathansampson> Snugug Unfortunately there's not a reliable method for listening to changes in an elements height. Instead, what you should do is listen via the methods that will change the height - that, or you could apply a general function to run once all Ajax requests are successful.
[07:23:09] <seutje> dobry wiecz√≥r!
[07:23:16] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Hmm, okay. Thanks
[07:23:28] <jonathansampson> Snugug Check ?$.ajax
[07:24:08] <jonathansampson> Specifically the Success method.
[07:24:29] <jonathansampson> It will let you bind some logic that will be ran after every successful ajax request.
[07:24:42] <kojiro> The Success Method sounds like one of those specious self-help books ;)
[07:25:45] <jonathansampson> I'm sorry, Snugug, what I meant was $.ajaxSuccess() or $.ajaxComplete()
[07:25:54] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Okay, thanks
[07:26:20] <skylined101> hi guys
[07:26:26] <jonathansampson> Hello skylined101
[07:26:41] <skylined101> hey jonathan
[07:26:56] <Snugug> jonathansampson: I don't think those are going to work because I"m not in direct control over the AJAX JS, that's being handled by Drupal
[07:27:56] <skylined101> i have jquery script i want to install on a html template , js folder , css and images . what code shoud i write on html ..
[07:27:57] <jonathansampson> Snugug Those are independent and global.
[07:28:12] <jonathansampson> You don't need to have access to the code making the request. These act globally to all requests.
[07:28:14] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Oh, okay. I'll look more closely at that then
[07:28:18] <Snugug> Thank you very much!
[07:28:30] <BlaDe^> when using e.preventDefault() on an anchor, it stops them being able to open it which is good - but they can't highlight it either, can I make that possible?
[07:28:30] <jonathansampson> $.ajaxSuccess and $.ajaxComplete :)
[07:28:57] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Are you usingit with $.click() ?
[07:29:03] <BlaDe^> yes jonathansampson
[07:30:36] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ I'm able to highlight just fine - http://jsbin.com/ejevi5/edit
[07:30:48] <jonathansampson> Perhaps it's a browser bug? Which browser are you using? (I'm in Chrome)
[07:31:56] <BlaDe^> hmm you're right htat isn't a result of the e.PreventDefault() - what could cause it?
[07:32:48] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Could be any number of things, honestly. No way for me to tell without seeing more code.
[07:35:24] <BlaDe^> jonathansampson: http://pastie.org/2047939 -- is that enough?
[07:36:34] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Nothing there would prevent it from being selected.
[07:36:53] <jonathansampson> I'm thinking you might have some type of event on the parent of the link that responds to clicks, maybe.
[07:37:05] <jonathansampson> Corretion: One ONE OF the parents of the link.
[07:37:47] <kggle> any1 familar with smoothdivscroll.com ?
[07:38:01] <rio{> Is it possible to translate content of fields created with the hook_menu() items
[07:38:30] <rio{> system_settings_form is used to create a form on that page
[07:38:36] <BlaDe^> jonathansampson there's no event listeners on the parent containers
[07:38:47] <rio{> oops
[07:38:51] <rio{> wrong channel sorry
[07:38:53] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Got another one for you, if you can help. How can I select an element based on a partial ID?
[07:39:34] <jonathansampson> $("[id^=foo]"); matches foo_bar, foo, food, foo_bazz
[07:39:45] <Snugug> jonathansampson: Huzzah! Thanks!
[07:40:08] <Snugug> Thank you oh might JS ninja
[07:40:14] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Not sure what would cause it then. Do yo have the page online public?
[07:40:19] <monk14> hey all, quick question... i need to select 150 Employees from a webform to email. and was just curious any cool jquery UI plugins or UI pattern to do so? Only one i seen is the -> and <- buttons to move from a 'not selected' list to a 'selected list'
[07:40:22] <jonathansampson> Snugug You're welcome :)
[07:40:39] <BlaDe^> jonathansampson it isn't ublic, can I notice you a link/login?
[07:40:49] <BlaDe^> public*
[07:41:08] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Do you have a lot of javascript/jquery?
[07:41:13] <BlaDe^> nope
[07:41:32] <jonathansampson> Okay; can you post just the JavaScript online?
[07:42:16] <BlaDe^> I think I found the culprit
[07:42:27] <jonathansampson> W00t.
[07:42:33] <BlaDe^> http://pastie.org/private/lrvfq0t4k9tst2iprosgyq
[07:42:39] <BlaDe^> i think it's to do with that
[07:42:48] <BlaDe^> that's the only JS which acts on the parent
[07:43:30] <BlaDe^> i can't see how it would cause it, but i'll test without that code
[07:44:14] <jonathansampson> Might have something to do with it.
[07:44:28] <BlaDe^> hmm it isn't a JS problem. just tried removing the js
[07:45:37] <odyniec> monk14: http://odyniec.net/projects/selectlist/
[07:46:33] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ I was just about to suggest looking at HTML/CSS :)
[07:47:03] <odyniec> monk14: don't know if it would suit you for selecting 150 items, though
[07:48:06] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ I see what you're talking about now.
[07:48:08] <jonathansampson> Hmm...
[07:48:38] <monk14> odyniec, pretty cool.... well, i guess you'd selected 10 maybe out of those 150... it would be cool if the plugin worked with multiple="multiple" select list so you can scroll down and see everyone more easily. i don't think it does as i just tried adding multiple with firebug
[07:48:39] <jonathansampson> I'm not sure you want people manually selecting the text.
[07:49:04] <jonathansampson> If you do, they will possibly get only a partial bit of the HTML LINK text, or the DELETE FILE LINK.
[07:49:15] <jonathansampson> Probably best if they stick with the Copy Code, in all honesty.
[07:49:24] <BlaDe^> i just wanted a slight work around for non-flash users
[07:49:27] <BlaDe^> or even noscript
[07:50:00] <jonathansampson> Well; if you they don't have flash, you don't need to worry about binding that js logic you have from earlier, do you?
[07:50:02] <odyniec> monk14: right, it does not, just single selection
[07:50:13] <BlaDe^> no I suppose not, jonathansampson
[07:50:21] <BlaDe^> but if they don't hae flash at least they should be able to copy the download link
[07:50:28] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ I wonder if you could invoke that binding from flash.
[07:50:35] <jonathansampson> The fallback would be a standard link, correct?
[07:50:49] <davidmurdoch> Can I get the URI from a jXHR `complete` callback?
[07:50:51] <monk14> odyniec, this seems a lil closer: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/ maybe i'll take a look at athat
[07:51:18] <BlaDe^> jonathansampson as a fallback I wanted the user to be able to select/manually cop ythe download link
[07:52:04] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ Yeah, I would expect that to be done without issue in the absense of any JavaScript modifying the behavior of .urlbox (or whatever that parent was :))
[07:52:11] <jonathansampson> Or did you say the JS changed nothing when removed?
[07:52:28] <monk14> odyniec, woh this is cool: http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect/    you can select and type to find in one list to populate other.
[07:53:42] <grumm3t> got a recommendation for a locale storage plugin? there seem to be a few options
[07:53:55] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ It's a CSS issue.
[07:54:07] <jonathansampson> I began turning off some of your rules in Firebug, and the link became selectable.
[07:54:18] <odyniec> monk14: yeah, this would probably be your best choice for such a long list of options
[07:54:28] <BlaDe^> jonathansampson which element was you turning them off in?
[07:54:35] <jonathansampson> BlaDe^ The links themselves.
[07:54:56] <jonathansampson> I would go to line 292 in sendspace.css, remove all the rules, then slowly build them up again.
[07:55:10] <jonathansampson> Removing the width:410px rule made a big difference I think.
[07:57:15] <le_coeur> test

[07:57:55] <nVee> hey, in jquery, what would be the best way to force decimal numbers?
[07:58:06] <nVee> I know you get num.toFixed()
[07:58:09] <jonathansampson> nVee, that's a JavaScript question - not a jQuery question :)
[07:58:11] <nVee> but would that be the best way?
[07:58:14] <nVee> ah okay
[07:59:51] <orolo> i'm trying to send a spacebar event to a function like so        $(eventTextBox).val(window.event.keyCode=49);
[08:00:06] <orolo> but that isn't working.
[08:00:33] <jonathansampson> orolo You're trying to trigger the keypress method programmatically?
[08:00:51] <orolo> jonathansampson: yes, so it shows up as the event.
[08:01:49] <jonathansampson> orolo See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832059

[08:07:34] <jonathansampson> juha____ That would be cool - from the armpit to the ankle :)
[08:08:03] <davidmurdoch> Can I get the URI from a jXHR `complete` callback?
[08:09:52] <dbugger> is there any advantage of $(".myclass", this) against $(this).find(".myclass") ?
[08:10:42] <phlp> no
[08:11:15] <jonathansampson> dbugger My gut tells me the one uses the other secretly.
[08:13:07] <davidmurdoch> Seriously, can I get the URI from a jXHR `complete` callback?
[08:13:45] <jonathansampson> dbugger Turns out my gut was right - the jQuery development code shows the following when context is provided: } else { return this.constructor( context ).find( selector ); }
[08:13:59] <jonathansampson> So $(".foo", this) is interpreted as $(this).find(".foo") internally.
[08:14:57] <jonathansampson> So, you could escape unnecessary comparisons by just using $(this).find(".foo") right off the bat, but performance advantages would be negligable.
[08:15:47] <juha____> jonathansampson: i started to stalk you on twitter.
[08:16:10] <jonathansampson> juha____ Cool :) Can't have enough stalkers stalking.

[08:28:27] <gopus> quick question because I am at a lost... is there any reason why the triangle icon in an accordion structure would be placed on a different line than the header?
[08:29:12] <gopus> www.millerc.com/index_copy.php <----- the triangle icon appears ABOVE the accordion header  in both Firefox and IE for me, and I don't understand it at all :-(
[08:29:30] <gopus> the code is very framework too

[08:31:49] <blk_panther> heyho, how do I create an element (onload) and change this element (onload, too) -> I want to use the tabs plugin, and create the list for it onload (unobstrusive -> no js = no list)
[08:33:00] <Brodingo> ?load
[08:33:10] <Brodingo> godamnit bot-t
[08:33:11] <Phrogz_> blk_panther: var el = $("<div>hi mom</div>"); Do it whenever you like.

[08:38:40] <zmbmartin> why does returnVal comebask undefined in this --> https://gist.github.com/1019071
[08:38:56] <ch3mical> Isn't there a function to convert a string of, say comma-delimited values, into an array? Or will I just have to do it programmatically with split/push
[08:38:59] <zmbmartin> I want returnVal to change depending on the ajax call
[08:39:14] <m0sphere> I have a php script that loops multiple times creating multiple div tags with the same class name. i'm trying to use jquery to compare if the text in class1 is equal to the text in class2, if it is, then i want to hide class3, but only for that specific loop. I'm having problems targeting class3 within the specific loop. does anyone have an idea how I might do this?
[08:39:33] <ngharo> ch3mical: what do mean? split is a function..
[08:40:06] <blk_panther> hmm, don't get it: http://jsfiddle.net/Cgu9M/
[08:41:01] <jayflux> Does anybody know why this code only works the first time around http://jsfiddle.net/ZLcym/
[08:41:02] <jonathansampson> ch3mical string.split(",") will create an array.
[08:41:11] <ch3mical> ngharo: I mean like .toArray or something
[08:41:24] <phlp> zmbmartin: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:41:28] <jonathansampson> ch3mical .split(",") results in an array.
[08:41:39] <ngharo> ^^
[08:41:40] <jonathansampson> http://jsbin.com/afunu4/edit
[08:41:48] <jonathansampson> See example there.
[08:42:00] <ch3mical> jonathansampson: I thought that just creates an object? If I do someArray = someString.split(',') that will work?
[08:42:17] <jonathansampson> ch3mical Yes.
[08:42:18] <jayflux> jonathansampson:  you know why this only works once for all images then stops

[08:42:23] <ch3mical> Oh sweet
[08:42:28] <jonathansampson> Totally :)
[08:42:32] <ch3mical> I knew it would be something ridiculously simple
[08:42:34] <ch3mical> lol
[08:42:42] <jayflux> click features and benefits
[08:42:46] <ch3mical> Thanks
[08:42:47] <jonathansampson> ch3mical Some of the most perplexing problems usually are :)
[08:42:53] <jonathansampson> jayflux I'll check it out.
[08:42:56] <zmbmartin> phlp: how should I be doing this then?
[08:43:11] <ch3mical> I know, and that's why I asked before I wasted 30 characters of code on a loop
[08:43:12] <zmbmartin> phlp: just joking
[08:43:13] <jayflux> thanks a lot bud, the code that runs it is here http://jsfiddle.net/ZLcym/

[08:43:46] <blk_panther> Brodingo? anyone else? http://jsfiddle.net/Cgu9M/
[08:43:48] <jonathansampson> I did, and rolled over a bunch of images.
[08:43:54] <jayflux> hover over the first image in the thumbnails, you'll see some text on the first one
[08:44:08] <jayflux> underneath the main image - you may have to refresh if you've already rolled over the images
[08:44:21] <jayflux> once refreshed hover over the first image - top left
[08:44:25] <blk_panther> I want to place the list in my code and then make tabs out of the list
[08:44:44] <jonathansampson> jayflux Your problem is that the text isn't showing up consistently?
[08:44:50] <jayflux> yeah it shows up the first time
[08:45:04] <jayflux> then after that it doesnt work
[08:45:20] <jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/ZLcym/ < the code for it is here
[08:45:51] <ch3mical> Except now I have a new problem... Here's what I'm doing... I'm trying to load a cookie and create an array or set the array to default values if the cookie doesn't exist: myArray = $.cookie('myString').split(',') | [false,false,true];
[08:46:08] <ch3mical> But I can't split a null, so the | (or) fails
[08:46:29] <ch3mical> I was really hoping this could all be done with one simple statement
[08:46:46] <phlp> jayflux: you should be doing this with css
[08:46:55] <jayflux> how do you mean phlp
[08:48:08] <ch3mical> Maybe if I do myArray = $.cookie('myString') ? $.cookie('myString').split : [false,false,true]; hmmm
[08:48:21] <ch3mical> (thinking aloud) ;p
[08:48:43] <jayflux> phlp:  I don't know how you would pull that off in just CSS
[08:49:14] <ch3mical> Yep, that works
[08:49:21] <ch3mical> Thanks ch3mical!
[08:50:51] <blk_panther> again: I want to add tabs in my website with jquery, it takes a list and makes tabs via .tabs() ... but I don't want the list to be seen if one has no js enabled, so I want to insert the list with jquery before and after that I want .tabs() it http://jsfiddle.net/Cgu9M/
[08:51:42] <vasocreta> the more I use jquery, the more I am miffed by the idea that plugins do not have to actually check to see if the library is loaded first. Anyone else running into this issue?
[08:51:43] <phlp> jayflux: http://jsfiddle.net/avWVp
[08:52:37] <zmbmartin> phlp: ok so I can't seem to figure this out. I need to return true if the ajax call was successful or false it is wasn't?
[08:53:33] <jayflux> nice phlp  but it wont work if the larger image is in another DIv will it
[08:53:44] <vasocreta> I have several scripts being loaded into a page that require jQuery. How do I get them to wait before execution until the jquery library is loaded first?
[08:54:11] <phlp> jayflux: why would it need to be?
[08:54:20] <blk_panther> inserted wrong, thx all
[08:54:24] <jayflux> because i have it set up
[08:54:38] <jayflux> i want the thumbnails to be on the left and images with text on the right
[08:56:47] <phlp> jayflux: this more like what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/avWVp/1
[08:57:09] <jayflux> yeah thats much closer
[08:57:59] <jayflux> although having the larger image in an asbolute div may harm me later on as the text underneath will be different sizes
[08:58:14] <jayflux> so i will need the parent div to scale
[09:02:37] <ngharo> hey jayflux just a tip.  you should consider wrapping you slider code into a function.  You have lots of code reuse there.  Also, when declaring variables make sure to use 'var foo = bar', rather than 'foo = bar'
[09:07:06] <blast_hardcheese> What am I missing here? http://paste.pound-python.org/show/0oDzwC6yTepFIVdjtpJ3/
[09:07:35] <blast_hardcheese> the <li /> elements don't get added to the <ul />
[09:08:04] <blast_hardcheese> I can $.log() the li and the ul all the way through the loop, everything is correct
[09:08:13] <blast_hardcheese> the lis just don't get appended for some reason
[09:08:41] <zmbmartin> phlp: is my answer somewhere in that documentation you linked me to?
[09:11:49] <phlp> zmbmartin: just says think asynch. do what you need to do in the callback no need to return anything
[09:12:50] <mheap> Evening all
[09:13:15] <zmbmartin> phlp: This is for a form field validation so I am hitting the server the check if something is there. The validation library is expecting me to return true or false.

[09:25:44] <mheap> Has anyone managed to use a custom modal confirm dialog in a .submit() element?
[09:26:36] <janthony> I'm using .cycle() and it works great. I have it cycling through images and flash objects. The images are perfect, however, the flash object is delayed, so when it transitions from an image slide to a flash slide, there is about a 1 second delay before the flash starts playing. I'm using JW Player and here is my .cycle() code $("#backgrounds").cycle({ delay: 0, timeout: 3000, fx: 'none' }) - Any ideas?

[10:02:43] <inc0> hi, I have problem- I have var x with some integer in it, f.e. 3. and I have <select><option value="3"></select> how do I check it with jquery?
[10:03:03] <mxbtty> define it
[10:03:30] <Phrogz_> For "find or create an element and get a jQuery reference to it" is there a better pattern than this:
[10:03:35] <Phrogz_> var rows = body.find('tr'); var row = (rows[s] || $('<tr />').appendTo(body)[0]);
[10:03:51] <Phrogz_> (where 's' is an index in a loop)
[10:04:22] <Phrogz_> ...and where it would help if I had the $ in front of the    (rows[s] || ...)  as intended.
[10:05:20] <gym_jane> is there any way of getting box shadow to work in IE 7?

[10:11:32] <dsdeiz> hello, i've binded an event scroll on 'window' tho the js that comes with an app im using tends to rebind the event.. for elements i just check if it has a specific class; if not, i add a class so that the element now has the class and won't get the event rebinded.. any suggestions?
[10:12:23] <tbranyen> you bound, not binded
[10:13:26] <dsdeiz> oops, my bad.. "i've bound an event..."
[10:19:31] <dsdeiz> for elements i do $('element:not(.class)').addClass('class').click(...) but $(window) i'm not sure how to do this.. any ideas? :D
[10:21:10] <sic1> has anyone been having issues with Chrome 12 (current stable) and large javascript w/jquery apps?

[10:25:38] <nickmeh> so I'm using an iframe, and I need to display it immediately but only after .ready has fired, can't wait for .load
[10:25:48] <nickmeh> I always need to use a .delegate event handler on it's contents
[10:25:54] <nickmeh> can't seem to get this to work
[10:26:11] <nickmeh> $iframe.contents().delegate('a','click',handler) works fine
[10:26:52] <nickmeh> $iframe.ready(function(){ $(this).delegate('a','click',handler) }); doesn't seem to work
[10:27:16] <nickmeh> any ideas?
[10:28:21] <nickmeh> $iframe.ready(function(){ this }); <-- this == HTMLDocument
[10:29:11] <phlp> nickmeh: http://api.jquery.com/contents
[10:31:32] <nickmeh> # phlp right but when I do $iframe.ready(function() { $(this).contents().delegate('a','click',handler); });
[10:31:47] <nickmeh> # phlp my handler never fires
[10:32:30] <nickmeh> phlp: right but when I do $iframe.ready(function() { $(this).contents().delegate('a','click',handler); });
[10:32:39] <nickmeh> phlp: my handler never fires
[10:33:19] <dsdeiz> anyone? :D how do i implement sth like $('element:not(.class)').addClass('class').click(...) to $(window)?
[10:33:48] <phlp> nickmeh: how about .contents().find('body').delegate
[10:35:22] <nickmeh> phlp: still nadda
[10:35:39] <nickmeh> phlp: $iframe.contents().delegate works fine
[10:35:56] <nickmeh> phlp: but I need to have the event handlers in place before I show the frame
[10:36:28] <nickmeh> phlp: and $iframe.contents is firing with $iframe.load(function() { $(this).contents()...

[10:39:21] <dsdeiz> oooh thanks!
[10:45:40] <Alphard> hey, has anyone encountered this weird behavior, when I include jquery before </body> like this: <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.6.1.min.js"></script>
[10:45:57] <Alphard> the background of the body disappears in IE8 and Opera 11
[10:47:06] <Alphard> take a look: http://vtu.aiesec.bg/1/script_bug.html
[10:48:06] <nickmeh> Alphard: I thikn it's the you're trying to append to a elem before it's closed?
[10:48:10] <nym> hey, i'm trying to find a chat room for backbone.js
[10:48:17] <nickmeh> Alphard: that you're*
[10:48:49] <Alphard> nickmeh, same thing happens if I remove the append
[10:49:00] <nickmeh> Alphard: $(document).ready(function(){ $('<p>blah blah</p>').appendTo('body'); });
[10:49:13] <nickmeh> Alphard: try that, see if it still bugs out
[10:49:40] <melvinram> this might sound dumb... but how do I get the division of 2 numbers without the decimal?
[10:49:53] <nickmeh> melvinram: parseInt
[10:50:12] <nickmeh> melvinram: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[10:50:19] <Alphard> ok i updated it
[10:50:26] <Alphard> still have the issue
[10:50:33] <Phrogz_> melvinram: You round or floor or ceil the result.
[10:50:51] <melvinram> nickmeh: thanks... that's what I needed
[10:51:04] <nickmeh> Alphard: is there a reason you have to include jquery in the body rather than the head?
[10:51:22] <tbranyen> nickmeh: because putting it in the head slows down page rendering
[10:51:25] <Phrogz_> nickmeh: Speed
[10:51:26] <tbranyen> it blocks rendering
[10:51:29] <Alphard> yeah
[10:51:47] <nickmeh> lol, brainfart
[10:52:32] <Alphard> any other ideas/suggestions
[10:53:13] <Alphard> tried src="/jquery-1.6.1.min.js"
[10:53:23] <Alphard> but it doesn't include it
[10:53:30] <nickmeh> Alphard: yea that's just a relative link
[10:54:11] <nym> hey does anyone here know what channel the backbone.js guys hang out on?
[10:55:23] <lugzer> what's wrong with this piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/RHknQ/2/ -- the php script i'm calling can't see the dates ($_POST is empty ?)
[10:55:48] <nickmeh> Alphard: function tryit() { var myp = document.createElement('p'); myp.innerHTML = 'blah blah'; document.body.appendChild(myp); } tryit();
[10:55:58] <nickmeh> Alphard: see if that does it as well
[10:56:28] <Alphard> same thing
[10:56:40] <nickmeh> Alphard: alright, well that rules out jquery
[10:56:44] <Alphard> the problem is with the way jquery is included
[10:56:57] <Alphard> i don't need to have any running script
[10:57:12] <Alphard> i tried a different .js file, its fine
[10:57:13] <nickmeh> Alphard: ahh misunderstood the question
[10:57:22] <nickmeh> Alphard: try moving the jquery include after </body>
[10:57:29] <nickmeh> Alphard: just to see what happens
[10:57:33] <Alphard> k
[10:58:39] <eddiemonge> nickmeh: thats not a valid place for files
[10:58:43] <Alphard> now the script doesn't work
[10:59:04] <ryrych> hi, I have two sets of anchors (different class) I have installed my plugin upon. Plugin is run twice on both sets. Is it correct that clicking on the first set returning this.element returns also elements from the second set?
[10:59:16] <nickmeh> eddiemonge: I've done it before, and it works.
[10:59:17] <ryrych> shouldn't they be separate?
[10:59:26] <nickmeh> Alphard: I don't know man
[10:59:49] <Alphard> i'll try posting it on the jquary forums
[10:59:52] <eddiemonge> nickmeh: it may work but its not valid
[10:59:57] <eddiemonge> Alphard: whats the problem?
[11:00:02] <Alphard> jquery*
[11:00:18] <phlp> Alphard: did you try a different doctype like html4?
[11:00:35] <ryrych> please ping me if you know
[11:00:42] <burntflowers> is there someone in here responsible for removing spam posts masquerading as plugins?
[11:00:42] <Alphard> phlp, yep
[11:01:07] <Alphard> eddiemonge, see http://vtu.aiesec.bg/1/script_bug.html - background disappears in IE8/Opera 11
[11:01:23] <Alphard> this line is somehow causing it <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.6.1.min.js"></script>
[11:02:58] <eddiemonge> Alphard: is the background gone completely or does the p tag have the background?
[11:03:25] <monk14> hello all, just curious ive seen in a change event listener for radio button inputs: $("input[@name='size']:checked").val() ... can you check with soemthing shorter like $(this).val() ?
[11:03:32] <Alphard> eddiemonge, in IE8 it's gone, in Opera 11 only the <p> has it
[11:04:01] <eddiemonge> Alphard: add this to your body style:  border: 1px solid green;
[11:04:41] <Alphard> done
[11:05:19] <Alphard> the body seems not to cover the whole page
[11:05:45] <eddiemonge> thats what i thought
[11:05:48] <monk14> looks like $(this).val() works. i just didn't think so initially.
[11:05:51] <Alphard> but in IE8 even this part has no bg
[11:05:54] <monk14> nvm
[11:05:56] <eddiemonge> its not jquery
[11:06:11] <eddiemonge> Alphard: add html, body { height: 100%; } then see what happens
[11:06:17] <monk14> Has jquery always used Sizzle css selector?
[11:06:20] <nguyendh> says $('.special') return 10 inputs, i want to select the 1st and 5th element, how can i do that
[11:06:37] <janthony> Does anyone here have any experience with the .cycle plugin?
[11:06:44] <sorens3n> $container = $('.special')
[11:06:45] <dipser> try using #cccccc
[11:06:49] <sorens3n> $container[0]
[11:06:54] <sorens3n> $container[4]
[11:06:56] <eddiemonge> monk14: yeah why?
[11:06:56] <nguyendh> ic
[11:07:08] <sorens3n> since a class selector will return an array i bleive
[11:07:17] <Alphard> ugly things happen :ƒ
[11:07:18] <eddiemonge> ?,eq() @ nguyendh
[11:07:20] <Alphard> :D
[11:07:30] <eddiemonge> hmm not bot-t
[11:07:35] <eddiemonge> Alphard: like what?
[11:07:41] <sorens3n> which, assigning a 'query' to an object is good practice
[11:07:47] <sorens3n> so you dont over-query the DOM
[11:07:50] <monk14> I was looking in the jquery src and saw it said it included Sizzle. so I was just curious what engine it has used in past. (thought maybe it was homegrown)
[11:08:06] <monk14> eddiemonge, ^
[11:08:16] <Alphard> the body now has a scrollbar, still no bg in IE
[11:08:24] <codinghurts> trying to attach a session cookie to a Promo Ad animation function with the Jquery cookies plugin. I'm having some trouble with the code. Does anyone have a quick second to take a look? Code: http://jsfiddle.net/rfnz8/
[11:08:35] <eddiemonge> monk14: it is pretty much.
[11:08:38] <dipser> background-color:#cccccc; ? :D
[11:08:44] <dipser> go to hell ie
[11:08:54] <lugzer> anyone please take a look? php answers with undefined index for datepicker_begin... why $_POST is empty? http://jsfiddle.net/RHknQ/2/
[11:08:55] <eddiemonge> Alphard: do you have a live link cuz i think something else is wrong with your page
[11:09:01] <eddiemonge> oops jk
[11:09:08] <Alphard> http://vtu.aiesec.bg/1/script_bug.html
[11:09:44] <nguyendh> eddiemonge, how to use your eq() ? $('.special').each(function() {$(this).eq(1) }) ?
[11:10:11] <eddiemonge> nguyendh: use the api docs http://api.jquery.com/eq
[11:10:14] <dipser> alphard have u tried it?
[11:10:29] <Alphard> tried what?
[11:10:38] <Alphard> oh
[11:10:41] <nguyendh> thanks guy
[11:10:43] <phlp> Alphard: try it with this one http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[11:10:46] <eddiemonge> Alphard: you really should be using a css reset
[11:11:00] <eddiemonge> phlp: that wont matter. its just the default css styling
[11:11:03] <sorens3n> coding: not sure, that actually looks like it should work?
[11:11:15] <sorens3n> why are you return false;?
[11:11:37] <sorens3n> not that it matters
[11:11:40] <monk14> lugzer, what happens when you just sub strings into your map?
[11:11:49] <Alphard> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js <-- this fixes it
[11:11:53] <monk14> not sure what happens when supply var1: var1 type format
[11:11:56] <Alphard> what's the difference?
[11:12:22] <Alphard> oh, it's 1.6.2
[11:12:43] <dipser> does someone know what i did wrong with parallax? http://jsfiddle.net/9jYcY/  ( http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html )
[11:12:57] <phlp> i'm guessing its http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.js line 1282 set background:none on body (even though its supposed to be an invis one?) but it's changed in the current build
[11:13:04] <monk14> lugzer, or supply string like  "?test1=blah&test2=foo"
[11:13:08] <lugzer> monk14, php script is supposed to read those dates, if i put strings then php will say that date() function requires date object not string..
[11:13:20] <lugzer> monk14, that would mean there's something wrong with the map assignment...
[11:13:30] <Alphard> phlp, this seems like a major bug
[11:13:36] <janthony> I'm using .cycle() as a rotator to rotate between images and flash objects. However when it rotates to a flash object, it doesn't show the flash object immediately, it's about a 1 second delay. any ideas how to make it show immediately?
[11:13:53] <eddiemonge> lugzer: what does the console say: http://jsfiddle.net/RHknQ/3/
[11:14:00] <phlp> Alphard: well if that is what caused it they seem to be aware of it
[11:14:29] <codinghurts> sorens3n: No clue, didn't write that part :)
[11:14:32] <monk14> lugzer, so if you just post to a simple php page that only just <?php echo "date1:". datepicker_begin; ?> what happens?
[11:14:46] <Alphard> so i guess it should be fixed in 1.6.2 when it's released?
[11:14:57] <sorens3n> coding: try just setting the cookie between 'true' and 'false'
[11:15:00] <sorens3n> instead of deleting it
[11:15:10] <sorens3n> or 'open' 'closed'
[11:15:16] <lugzer> eddiemonge, ha, this is interesting. here's the output: Date {Fri Jun 03 2011 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)} Date {Fri Jun 10 2011 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)}
[11:15:57] <sorens3n> lugzer: can you use the Date().getTime() in JS, or whichever passes in miliseconds
[11:16:03] <sorens3n> so your not dealing with strings, it might help
[11:16:10] <eddiemonge> ok then in your php script do <?php echo print_r($_POST, true); ?> and see what the response is in console
[11:16:55] <sorens3n> coding: https://github.com/sorensen/aebleskiver/blob/master/public/views/appView.js
[11:17:11] <sorens3n> line 148 - 181
[11:17:19] <sorens3n> those work for me everytime
[11:17:22] <lugzer> eddiemonge, it alerts empty array... Array()
[11:18:28] <eddiemonge> lugzer: in the console, what is being shown as being sent? do you have a live link?
[11:19:48] <lugzer> eddiemonge, no live link unfortunately... let me do one thing
[11:20:54] <lugzer> i thought that i need to have a <form> on the page. but that didn't change a thing...
[11:20:55] <lugzer> damn
[11:21:09] <eddiemonge> lugzer: what browser are you using?
[11:21:14] <TheoMurpse> Is setting data via .data() global? Because I seem to be having a scope problem where I do $(selector).data('foo',bar) in one anonymous function, and then in a later anonymous function I try $(selector).data('foo') and get undefined.
[11:21:22] <lugzer> eddiemonge, firefox
[11:21:44] <eddiemonge> TheoMurpse: are the functions actually executing in that order?
[11:21:44] <lugzer> but i get same error in chrome
[11:22:02] <eddiemonge> lugzer: in the console tab, are the post values being sent correctly?
[11:22:28] <lugzer> eddiemonge, that's the problem. they're not there at all
[11:23:39] <ryrych> hey guys, no one knows? :(
[11:23:55] <lugzer> eddiemonge, but only when i change the value to a string, they're there
[11:24:01] <lugzer> looks like some name conflict perhaps
[11:24:20] <lugzer> i will investigate it.. for now i gotta go.. thanks for your inputs guys!
[11:24:32] <monk14> lugzer, can you try hardcoding the varibles in the map then?
[11:24:43] <monk14> if the string works. try the string values but in the map.
[11:24:48] <lugzer> monk14, i will try
[11:24:54] <monk14> maybe it gets confused when u have var1: var1
[11:24:58] <monk14> i dunno. lates
[11:25:19] <lugzer> thanks monk14 , will try that
[11:26:21] <Tallisman> Guys, I am wondering about the use of objects and namespaces combined :P, var namespace = {}; namespace.namespace2 = {};, this is possible. function Cat() { alert("bla") } <-- create the constructor. how can you 'nest' a constructor in an namespace?
[11:28:17] <systemfault> Why don't you try?
[11:28:50] <Tallisman> Can you do something like Namespace.function Cat() { alert("the rest"); } ?
[11:28:58] <systemfault> Sure
[11:29:08] <Tallisman> o.o
[11:29:21] <Tallisman> facepalm*
[11:29:24] <systemfault> var Lulz = {}; Lulz.Cat = function(){ alert('the rest'); };  Lulz.Cat();
[11:30:12] <systemfault> Or var Lulz = {Cat: function(){ alert('the rest'); }};  Lulz.Cat();
[11:30:55] <Tallisman> I deliberatly decided not to use maps :P
[11:31:15] <systemfault> Javascript doesn't have map or namespaes.
[11:31:28] <systemfault> *namespaces, we use objects to emulate them
[11:31:34] <Tallisman> yea :)
[11:32:31] <systemfault> var Lulz = {}; function Cat(){ alert('the rest'); }; Lulz.Cat = Cat;  Lulz.Cat();
[11:32:36] <systemfault> That's another way.
[11:33:17] <TheoMurpse> eddiemonge Yes they actuaully are. I have set breakpoints and verified. One is run at onload and the other is run after an input value is changed.
[11:33:54] <eddiemonge> onload or doc ready?
[11:34:40] <Tallisman> Thanks alot Systemfault, you saved my day :p
[11:35:02] <systemfault> Tallisman: If you use the last one... use a closure to isolate the functions
[11:36:27] <Tallisman> I chose to use var FakeNamespace = {}; FakeNamespace.Function = function() { } ^^
[11:36:37] <systemfault> Tallisman: Then no problem :)
[11:36:54] <systemfault> Don't forget the ; :P
[11:37:46] <phlp> i choose you pikachu!
[11:38:39] <TheoMurpse> eddiemonge whichever one is $(function() {});
[11:38:40] * systemfault uses STFU!, it's very effective
[11:39:11] <Tallisman> hahaha, thanks :P
[11:39:12] <TheoMurpse> .data('foo',bar) is run within $(function() {}) and .data('foo') is run within an event bound to .change
[11:39:30] <TheoMurpse> So I know the setting occurs before the retrieving. Also I've done breakpoitns to verify.
[11:40:35] <phlp> you sure the selectors match up?
[11:41:59] <TheoMurpse> phlp and eddiemonge  Here is the relevant code, snipped to only show the relevant parts. http://jsfiddle.net/LfEb7/ You can see there is a setting of data in $(function(){}) and a getting of data in eventChange(), which is only triggered as per the binding that is set at the bottom of $(function(){})
[11:42:43] <phlp> input[type="text"] != select
[11:43:29] <phlp> nevermind that.. i see what you did there
[11:43:58] <TheoMurpse> OK. Yeah I have both selects and text inputs, and any change of either should trigger the changeEvent. However, the "missing" data is only stored on the text inputs.
[11:44:36] <phlp> one suggestion that i dont think will help is .change(changeEvent) no need for the anon func
[11:45:38] <TheoMurpse> I guess so (I try to always surround my stuff in anonymous functions because I got bitten so many times when learning jQuery with not using them ending up causing tons of problems.
[11:45:55] <TheoMurpse> But it wouldn't matter. It seems to be a scope problem. data is set, and then it somehow gets destroyed.
[11:46:49] <TheoMurpse> Is there a way to make it so I'll get an alert when the value is changed? Some kind of $($(element).data('foo')).change(function() {alert(just got changed, captain)} ?
[11:46:54] <phlp> another one is what eddiemonge said earlier, are you sure the ajax is done when you try it? not the doc.ready but all the ajax calls inside it
[11:48:04] <TheoMurpse> phlp, I will try that now. I just refreshed the page, and I verified all AJAX queries are finished with firebug.
[11:48:43] <TheoMurpse> Nope, didn't help. I just changed a form value, and I'm havint the same problem of .data('nutritionData') being undefined.
[11:49:05] <phlp> did you try and get it back out right after you set it?
[11:49:17] <mlk> Hi guys, I'm somehow stuck using jQuery templates. Getting >>$("#recTempl").templ is not a function<< no matter what I'm trying
[11:49:31] <nail_> and are you sure 'f' is defined at all?
[11:49:35] <TheoMurpse> Yes. I tried alert($(selector).data('nutritionData')['name']) and it alerted the correct 'name'-key's value.
[11:49:39] <eddiemonge> mlk: did you include the tmpl plugin?
[11:49:42] <codinghurts> trying to attach a session cookie to a Promo Ad animation function with the Jquery cookies plugin. I'm having some trouble with the code. Does anyone have a quick second to take a look? Code: http://jsfiddle.net/rfnz8/
[11:50:09] <codinghurts> $20 via paypal to whoever can solve this for me.
[11:50:10] <mlk> eddiemonge: yea, <script type="text/javascript" scr="js/jquery.tmpl.min.js"></script>
[11:50:35] <ryrych> I have one element I add a click handler to. I add it in _create(). There are 4 elements. Is it possible to add the click only once, without queuing but pass it ‚Äòthis‚Äô scope of every element?
[11:50:40] <eddiemonge> mlk: and thats after jquery is loaded? and the script is loading correctly?
[11:51:06] <eddiemonge> ryrych: do what?
[11:51:27] <mlk> eddiemonge: I think so. It's inside $(function() { ... });
[11:53:40] <mlk> eddiemonge: I tried once with the microsoft source link and it worked
[11:53:41] <ryrych> eddiemonge: maximized simplified :D ok, I create a lightbox structure only once. It has a close button. Having ie 4 elements and clicking this button I want to know eg what options are used on this element
[11:53:48] <mlk> with the downloaded one it doesnt
[11:54:05] <mlk> no idea whats going on there
[11:55:03] <ryrych> eddiemonge: adding the click handler (on the first element) I am in a different scope
[11:55:39] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ ryrych
[11:55:42] <ryrych> eddiemonge: adding the click handler on every element, the handler is queued
[11:55:51] <eddiemonge> mlk: its probably not loading correctly
[11:55:57] <eddiemonge> oi bot-t i miss you
[11:56:04] <eddiemonge> ryrych: paste your code to jsfiddle.net
[11:56:31] <phlp> TheoMurpse: must be the ajax http://jsfiddle.net/LfEb7/1
[11:57:33] <mlk> eddiemonge: any idea how to wait for jQuery template to be loaded first?
[11:58:30] <TheoMurpse> phlp it's not, and I'll provide the screenshots to show it's not in just a second. Let me upload the screenshots of my debugger. I've isolated where the problem happepns, but have no idea why it happens.
[11:59:30] <devinrolsen> Hey all, Im trying to get the text of a first level list item while ignoring the text of this list items nested ul.. http://jsfiddle.net/AKxsJ/ anyone able to show me how not to alert any of the nested ul's text?
[12:00:33] <TheoMurpse> phlp, check out these two screenshots: http://kylegoetz.com/debug/Picture%2018.png and http://kylegoetz.com/debug/Picture%2019.png The only thing that happened between the screenshots was me clicking "step into" one time. So right after the data is set, it IMMEDIATELY is unset by whatever jquery is doing next.
[12:00:55] <TheoMurpse> The relevant variable watch is the very top one, the $($(blahblah
[12:01:45] <TheoMurpse> .data() goes FULLY NULL at that point. Not even blanked out. data() ceases to exist.
[12:02:10] <mlk> does the order of <script includes matter when loading jQuery template?
[12:02:14] <amid_hasan> hi
[12:04:12] <livi> devinrolsen: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/AKxsJ/1/
[12:04:30] <devinrolsen> ahhhh
[12:04:37] <devinrolsen> firstChild.nodeValue.
[12:04:39] <devinrolsen> thanks
[12:04:50] <livi> devinrolsen: no probs
[12:12:05] <phlp> TheoMurpse: "{"name":"KIRKLAND organ...":15,"205":..."  isn't valid json
[12:13:05] <TheoMurpse> phlp Even if it is, it's being set and stored (as the screenshot reveals). Then it vanishes. At no point does any of my code in question actually depend on it being JSON.
[12:13:11] <z10000> anyone every done custom select drop down boxes?
[12:13:46] <TheoMurpse> phlp And not to get side tracked, but why isn't it? It's literally the source of PHP saying json_encode(someArray)
[12:15:05] <phlp> should be {"key":"value","key2":"value2"} not "key":"value":15
[12:15:28] <amid_hasan> how do I create a div that continuously shows/hides itself
[12:15:28] <amid_hasan> ?
[12:15:42] <TheoMurpse> phlp that ... indicates there is a bunch of stuff missing from the display, not from teh JSON :)
[12:15:44] <livi> z10000: I've used what jQuery UI provides, written my own and used other plugins
[12:16:06] <phlp> TheoMurpse: yeah i just realized that.. i thought ... was in your text
[12:16:25] <TheoMurpse> Haha yeah, my stuff is very long-winded text. It's database of food nutrients, so there are a lot of detailed food descriptions.
[12:16:59] <TheoMurpse> In any case, side note that may help diagnose the problem: the AJAX calls are executing for every one of a dozen INPUTs. However, the AJAX success function is only executing once, and only for the FIRST input element.
[12:17:19] <livi> z10000: the jQuery UI autocomplete is the one I used very recently and it provides all the features that you'd expect in a select box + autocomplete + customizability
[12:17:31] <TheoMurpse> I had an error: function() {} at one point, but it never executed. So it's not an AJAX error. And besides, I've verified the AJAXed PHP is returning something every time, so no actual AJAX errors
[12:19:04] <amid_hasan> Anyone? I need this flashing animation to continue for a long time. How do I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/AKxsJ/11/
[12:19:32] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan: chain your commands
[12:20:04] <amid_hasan> let's say I want to have it run for 5 minutes?
[12:20:11] <phlp> TheoMurpse: really having that many ajax calls isnt the best way to do it. you should probably send an array of the ids then get back an array of {id:1,data:{name:"asdf"}}
[12:20:34] <TheoMurpse> phlp Yeah, I noticed that earlier this morning. I decided to fix this bug first.
[12:20:48] <TheoMurpse> Oh, WEIRD. I'm actually inspecting each of the INPUTs' data(), and it seems that the first INPUT's data is null, but the rest are correct! I wonder why...
[12:22:42] <phlp> TheoMurpse: didn't you just say only the first ajax completes? wouldnt that be why?
[12:23:16] <TheoMurpse> It seems like it ought to be the reverse, phlp. The one that completes ought to be correct and the rest are missing, but it seems the FIRST is missing and the rest or correct. No idea how that's happening...
[12:23:36] <TheoMurpse> the data is ONLY set in that ajax function and the ajax function ONLY executes for the first element. However, all but the first element have the data.
[12:23:39] <nail_> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/AKxsJ/18/
[12:25:24] <TheoMurpse> Aha! phlp I guess you'rer right about combining them all into one AJAX call. It seems that all the AJAX calls were made, but the VERY FIRST ONE hangs and never completes! So that is why the first is missing!
[12:25:57] <eddiemonge> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/AKxsJ/19/ so you can cancel it if you want by cancelling the settimeout cc nail_
[12:27:41] <nail_> eddiemonge: the fadeOut should be called in the fadeIn's callback instead of being chained :)
[12:28:29] <eddiemonge> nail_: why? they are queued
[12:28:54] <nail_> eddiemonge: you don't notice it in this case, but fadeIn() will return before the end of the animation
[12:29:05] <nail_> that's why there's the callback
[12:29:11] <phlp> TheoMurpse: the fewer the better. a guy i used to work with who had some weird obsession with silverlight made our intranet homepage make 20 ajax calls.. so slow
[12:30:04] <nickmeh> phlp: "loved silverlight" enough said.
[12:30:15] <livi> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/AKxsJ/20/ this flashes for every .5 sec until the duration is elapsed
[12:30:26] <TheoMurpse> Yeah, this app I'm working on, I'm actually considering rolling out to the public at my wife's suggestion. This morning it dawned on me how spectacularly dumb it was to have one page potentially triggering 100 AJAX calls and how it'd be better to combined them all. I planned to fix it after this bug was ironed out. Now I guess it is, but another has cropped up in another place. I'll get on the AJAX fix now. Thanks for your patienc
[12:30:26] <TheoMurpse> e and help!
[12:30:59] <phlp> np :)
[12:33:29] <dipser> yay fixed jparallax :D
[12:34:13] <dnyy> I'm confused. I have an element that starts off with no class on it. On a click event, I run this: http://pastie.org/2049127
[12:34:21] <dnyy> It seems to be working the opposite of how it should be and I'm not sure why. :/
[12:34:25] <dnyy> Anyone have a clue?
[12:34:52] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass
[12:35:05] <dnyy> phlp: I couldn't get toggleClass to work either, though. No errors, but nothing changes. :/
[12:35:29] <phlp> if (!$(element).hasClass('active')) emphasis on the !
[12:35:44] <dnyy> phlp: ?
[12:36:57] <phlp> if NOT hasClass, addClass .. ! is not
[12:37:37] <dnyy> phlp: I know, but that still doesn't work, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't seem to matter how I do it, it's doing the opposite of what it should.
[12:38:41] <ravenzz> who is "element" ?
[12:38:42] <ravenzz> :p
[12:38:52] <dnyy> ravenzz: yeah, about to paste a better example, my bad
[12:38:57] <ravenzz> maybe you are missing the quotes
[12:39:09] <dnyy> so this doesn't work at all: http://pastie.org/2049154
[12:39:11] <phlp> what exactly is the opposite? if it doesnt have the class it removes it? does the universe implode at the same time?
[12:40:41] <dnyy> if ($(x).hasClass('foo')) { console.log('yay') }
[12:40:49] <dnyy> assuming x doesn't have the class foo, it would console.log('yay')
[12:40:54] <dnyy> yet, if foo IS there, it doesn't
[12:41:29] <eddiemonge> dnyy: live link?
[12:41:58] <dnyy> eddiemonge: don't have it setup for that atm. :/
[12:42:02] <phlp> someone edited your jquery as a joke?
[12:42:09] <dnyy> phlp: it seems like it. :/
[12:42:21] <dnyy> it acts like hasClass is returning the opposite of what it's supposed to
[12:42:27] <dnyy> which is confusing and i have no idea why
[12:42:32] <dnyy> also no idea why toggleClass does nothing at all
[12:42:41] <phlp> nothing a ! won't fix
[12:42:49] <phlp> doesnt have to make sense
[12:43:01] <eddiemonge> dnyy: paste your exact code at jsfiddle
[12:43:16] <dnyy> eddiemonge: kk
[12:44:48] <Hoe``> $.param({foo: [1, 3, 4]}) gives me "foo%5B%5D=1&foo%5B%5D=3&foo%5B%5D=4"
[12:44:55] <Hoe``> note that there's no indexes in there
[12:45:07] <Hoe``> It seems to work properly on an object, but not on an array. Is this expected?
[12:45:29] <dnyy> eddiemonge: lol, of course it works on jsfiddle
[12:45:36] <dnyy> straight copy/paste
[12:45:48] <TheoMurpse> So I have an ajax call happening. Is it psosible  to have this happen similar to async:false but without locking up the browser? Basically I have a function to call that updates the display, and I don't want it to execute until the AJAX call is complete. However, I'd like the browser not to be locked up.
[12:46:17] <Hoe``> theomurpse: No, that's the point of async.
[12:46:24] <Hoe``> You just use an event instead
[12:46:28] <snover> Hoe``: there‚Äôs not supposed to be indexes in the keys for an array
[12:46:38] <TheoMurpse> Ideally, what I mean to have happen is: 1. load page; 2. execute AJAX calls; 3. user can interact freely; 4. once AJAX is done, update a graph on the webpage
[12:47:06] <TheoMurpse> Right now, the "update graph" is executing before AJAX is finished, and this is causing a JS error.
[12:47:20] <Hoe``> TheoMurpse: Yes, you just update the graph in the ajax complete event
[12:47:24] <Hoe``> or success, rather
[12:48:07] <Hoe``> $.ajax({ url: whatever, success: function() { graph.update(); }});
[12:48:10] <Hoe``> thanks snover
[12:48:13] <TheoMurpse> Hoe`` Haha, yeah, I just thought of that. Initially there were 10+ AJAX calls and I didn't want to redraw after each AJAX success. However, I managed to combine them into one request just about three minutes ago. Thanks :) :)
[12:48:59] <dnyy> okay, so it does toggle for like a split second
[12:49:18] <eddiemonge> dnyy: you arent binding it multiple times are you
[12:49:40] <dnyy> nope, i had searched for that earlier. at least this narrows it down, though.
[12:50:50] <odyniec> dnyy: maybe you're accidentally calling your event handler twice?
[12:51:57] <eddiemonge> dnyy: add a breakpoint point and walk through what is happening
[12:52:02] <dnyy> well, there we go. changing it to live click works.
[13:00:47] <phlp> just got some weird google results page with a rainbow coming off the search button and the results all shifted to the left over the menu

[13:03:08] <funnylookinhat> Anyone know if you can pass the jquery UI progressbar a color value to override whatever is set in the CSS for the background ON and OFF state ?
[13:24:51] <ch3mical> funnylookinhat: you cannot
[13:25:13] <ch3mical> funnylookinhat: use .css
[13:25:33] <funnylookinhat> Figured as much - thanks
[13:25:35] <ch3mical> Or modify the ui css if you want the change permanent
[13:25:42] <ch3mical> That would be the best way
[13:25:57] <ch3mical> Or, use the theme roller
[13:26:08] <ch3mical> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[13:26:24] <ch3mical> That might be easier than trying to dig through the css file
[13:28:50] <David_Bradbury> I'm using a click event - $('#blah').click(function(e).... | Is there a resource on the site on what 'e' would contain?

[13:31:30] <David_Bradbury> was looking for e.currentTarget.alt :D
[13:31:50] <freedrull> is there anyway to tell when a nomral http request has completed from javascript, or is ajax the only way to do that?
[13:32:09] <ch3mical> David_Bradbury: glad I could help ;)
[13:32:16] <David_Bradbury> ch3mical: :D
[13:32:46] <ryrych> eddiemonge: are you there?
[13:34:21] <ryrych> anyway, can someone take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/96ULK/ I don't know how to set it up in jsfiddle but I get the wrong scope
[13:41:44] <ryrych> ok, i've got it: http://jsfiddle.net/96ULK/1/
[13:52:25] <ShawnRisk> how do I use jquery to add css to an iframe?  	$('iframe').contents().find('#widget').css({ font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif });  Like this?
[13:52:28] <Jantire> hey
[13:52:50] <Jantire> can anyone help me with some stupid jQuery problem, the issue is that it's not registering the .click() event
[13:52:51] <Jantire> http://pastebin.com/Z0DLY7zN
[13:53:02] <Jantire> jQuery is loaded, as the $(document).ready() happens
[13:53:23] <nguyendh> can i have a suggestion on a easy to use (prefer easy to dynamically add ) tab library ?
[13:54:01] <phlp> Jantire: put the clicks in the ready as well
[13:54:53] <Jantire> phplp it still doesn't work
[13:55:24] <Jantire> pastebin is at http://pastebin.com/Z0DLY7zN
[13:55:26] <funnylookinhat> I'm trying to prevent the user from leaving a page through a confirmation message using $(window).unload(function() { ... but return false; within that function seems to still go to the next page
[13:56:11] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[13:56:49] <Phrogz_> I need help. I've created a pared-down test case. Why does my :gt(0) selector not find any cells? http://jsfiddle.net/ynrQz/1/
[13:56:52] <Jantire> ShawnRisk, Have you tried helping yourself?
[13:57:02] <ShawnRisk> Jantire: yes
[13:57:11] <Jantire> ShawnRisk, It doesn't sound like you tried hard enough
[13:57:12] <Phrogz_> ShawnRisk: Because iframes are teh suck.
[13:57:27] <ShawnRisk> Jantire: I have
[13:57:31] <phlp> ShawnRisk: use quotes { "font-family": "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" }
[13:57:39] <ShawnRisk> oh oops :P
[13:57:49] <darkfalz> hello
[13:57:51] <darkfalz> someone here?
[13:58:23] <Phrogz_> darkfalz: On IRC that sort of question is considered rude. Don't ask to ask, don't ask if someone is awake, just ask your question and wait patiently.
[13:58:38] <NickASloan> I'm getting an "Object does not support this method or property" error in IE8 on line 4 of this code: http://paste2.org/p/1463422
[13:58:42] <abjorn> I wouldn't say it's *rude* it's just unnecessary
[13:58:45] <NickASloan> can anyone offer a suggestion
[13:58:48] <johtso> If I'm using checkboxes to control the visibility of certain parts of my webapp, what's the best way to stop their status from being remembered when the user revisits the page?
[13:58:49] <ShawnRisk> phlp: I just tried that with no luck
[13:58:54] <abjorn> Anyways, what do you need, darkfalz?
[13:58:57] <darkfalz> can someone tell me how can i remove the Error Loading Page message on jquery mobile?
[13:59:00] <ShawnRisk> phlp: do you want to see a live example?
[13:59:06] <phlp> sure
[13:59:21] <abjorn> By fixing the errors, darkfalz? lol
[13:59:25] <darkfalz> no
[13:59:27] <darkfalz> not that
[13:59:31] <darkfalz> i really want to disable it
[13:59:51] <abjorn> I wouldn't know, but I can't see why you would want to disable it
[13:59:53] <Phrogz_> johtso: I've never tried, but: $(function(){ $('form').each(function(){ this.reset() }) });   ?
[14:00:05] <darkfalz> because i have my own error handling
[14:00:10] <abjorn> i see
[14:00:14] <darkfalz> but is there a way to do it?
[14:00:41] <abjorn> Maybe. jQuery Mobile is still pretty young so I don't know if everything is there yet, so there may or may not be a way to do it.
[14:00:52] <darkfalz> =(
[14:02:06] <abjorn> lmao he left and i just found the answer to his question
[14:02:18] <nerk> hey <button onclick="window.location.href='http://www.google.ca';">  <-- I want to prevent it from doing that onclick, how?
[14:03:14] <nerk> $(button).unbind().bind('click',function(event) { event.preventDefault(); // my stuff; }); doesn't stop that onclick from running
[14:04:48] <johtso> Phrogz_: that's a great solution, thanks!
[14:05:03] <Phrogz_> johtso: I hope it works. :)
[14:07:25] <systemfault> nerk: I would try $(button).prop('onclick', null);
[14:07:37] <systemfault> nerk: Just a guess, not sure if it actually works.
[14:07:39] <nerk> prop?
[14:07:51] <systemfault> Like "property"
[14:07:53] <nerk> I have $('button').removeAttr('onclick');
[14:07:54] <systemfault> A new 1.6 thing
[14:08:02] <systemfault> nerk: It works^
[14:08:10] <systemfault> Perfect then :)
[14:08:13] <nerk> and also tried $('button').attr('onclick','');
[14:08:20] <nerk> neither worked for me :(
[14:08:31] <systemfault> Then if you use 1.6, try prop
[14:08:57] <systemfault> If it doesn't, I would try $('button')[0].onclick = null;
[14:09:22] <nerk> ok
[14:10:32] <nerk> lol
[14:10:33] <nerk> meh
[14:10:37] <nerk> this seemed so trivial
[14:10:38] <madhat> if i'm using an object literal in javascript and i want to reference a variable in the object literal, how do i do that from within a jquery each loop? when i use this.type it tells me that the object i'm iterating through has no variable 'type'
[14:10:40] <nerk> guess not
[14:11:18] <nerk> check it out
[14:11:21] <nerk> none of this works
[14:11:21] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/7EGsc/2/
[14:11:27] <systemfault> madhat: perhaps jQuery.proxy would fix it
[14:11:35] <David_Bradbury> I'm currently testing in Firefox 4, Windows XP with Cleartype - When fading opacity, the text seems to make sudden jumps in transparency. I've tried removing the 'filter' attribute but it does nothing. Any ideas?
[14:12:05] <systemfault> nerk: Checking
[14:13:43] <systemfault> nerk: http://jsfiddle.net/7EGsc/3/
[14:14:50] <nerk> shit
[14:14:58] <nerk> so it doesn't like it mucked with WHILE being clicked
[14:15:36] <systemfault> :)
[14:16:00] <nerk> that kinda sucks for me lol
[14:16:01] <nerk> meh
[14:16:06] <systemfault> It happens :P
[14:16:16] <nerk> now I have to iterate the buttons
[14:16:17] <nerk> meh
[14:16:44] <systemfault> nerk: You understand that the real problem is your usage of onclick in the HTML^
[14:16:46] <systemfault> ?
[14:17:00] <nerk> not my usage
[14:17:10] <nerk> correcting something that is read in from a third party
[14:17:12] <systemfault> If you want a link, use a link <a> :)
[14:17:19] <systemfault> Ahh, I see :
[14:17:22] <systemfault> (
[14:17:23] <nerk> no doubt
[14:18:44] <madhat> systemfault: i read the documentation on $.proxy, but i don't see how that will solve my issue. my code is constructed in a manner like http://pastie.org/private/oy81w0kv62vnm0gmnuub3g. i want this.f() to reference obj.f(), not v.f()
[14:19:28] <systemfault> madhat: :'( jsfiddle is your friend..
[14:20:05] <madhat> *googles*
[14:20:45] <gym_jane> hi all
[14:20:47] <systemfault> I mean.. jsfiddle.net :/ That way, it's a lot easier for us to help
[14:21:04] <gym_jane> anyone know of any good cross browser 2 level vertical menus?
[14:21:22] <systemfault> madhat: I would do it simply like that http://jsfiddle.net/98ApA/
[14:21:39] <Jantire> Why doesn't previous_article && next_article launch the $.click() function? http://jsfiddle.net/AMabq/
[14:23:31] <Tallisman> I have an odd question, I am trying to 'for ( var i in strings ) { }, strings = [ "bla", "bla1" ];'
[14:23:44] <systemfault> Tallisman: Don't do that.
[14:23:53] <systemfault> Tallisman: for/in is for objects, not arrays
[14:24:02] <Jantire> can someone help me here?
[14:24:07] <Tallisman> so, what iterates arrays? :P
[14:24:36] <systemfault> Tallisman: Well, a simple for loop
[14:24:45] <Tallisman> oh, that easy >.<
[14:24:54] <kranZ> sorry im new to javascript... im currently using a timer and jQuery.load to replace a div, is it somehow possible to reload the div only if the page to load has changed?
[14:24:57] <systemfault> Tallisman: JS also has Array.forEach but you can't use it :P
[14:25:04] <systemfault> Tallisman: Finally, there's jQuery.each
[14:25:09] <Jantire> http://jsfiddle.net/AMabq/ - the <> aren't launching $.click functions
[14:25:19] <Tallisman> ah :), to bad :P
[14:25:37] <necromancer> kranZ: yes, but you will still have to make the ajax call to find out if the page has changed
[14:25:49] <systemfault> Tallisman: IIRC the syntax is: $.each(myArray, function(index, number) {} );
[14:26:00] <systemfault> Tallisman: Check the API doc to be 100% sure
[14:26:12] <necromancer> but you could save the response content in a global variable and compare it to the new version you get from ajax. if it's not the same, update the <div>.
[14:26:15] <Phrogz_> OK, I'll change my implementation, but why does      row.find('td:gt(0)').length  == 7    but   row.find('td').find(':gt(0)').length == 0?
[14:26:58] <necromancer> kranZ: i would recommend using $.ajax() and in the success callback, determine whether you need to load something into the div with .html
[14:27:30] <systemfault> Phrogz_: My guess is that it checks if :gt(0) for every item in the returned array
[14:27:44] <systemfault> Phrogz_: Not sure :/
[14:27:50] <kranZ> necromancer: ok thanks ill try that
[14:27:57] <Jantire> Can you guys read what I'm saying or am I just being ignored?
[14:28:17] <gym_jane> any?
[14:28:34] <Jantire> Can you guys read what I'm saying?
[14:28:39] <systemfault> Yes.
[14:28:43] <necromancer> Jantire: yeah of course
[14:28:54] <Phrogz_> Jantire: Yes, we see you.
[14:28:56] <necromancer> Jantire: you're not being specific enough
[14:28:58] <Jantire> I think I forgot to do /msg nickserv idenfgify
[14:29:01] <Jantire> oh alright
[14:29:18] <systemfault> Jantire: It's easier to get an answer if you ask for something specific instead of "Here my code, make it works bitches!"
[14:29:21] <necromancer> also, your problem isn't a problem on firefox 4, so you clearly forgot to tell us what browser you're experiencing the problem
[14:29:24] <Jantire> The #previous_article && the #next_article aren't registering the $.click() events
[14:29:28] <Jantire> I said that like 4 times though
[14:29:29] <Jantire> http://jsfiddle.net/AMabq/
[14:29:36] <Jantire> Chrome
[14:29:39] <necromancer> oh ok
[14:29:45] <Jantire> Beta version of Chrome
[14:30:11] <gym_jane> Jantire is that a clever way of voting up your submission on Reddit?
[14:30:16] <necromancer> Jantire: what the hell is this? window.headlines = data.items;
[14:30:16] <Jantire> In chrome the article isn't even showing up
[14:30:27] <Jantire> necromancer, global variable
[14:30:29] <necromancer> are you adding stuff to the window object? because if so, don't
[14:30:30] <necromancer> :)
[14:30:44] <Jantire> why shouldn't I create a global variable?
[14:30:51] <necromancer> for one, it's bad practice
[14:31:02] <Jantire> yes, but why?
[14:31:03] <necromancer> secondly, you don't need to add it to the DOM, that's also bad practice
[14:31:20] <Tallisman> so, for( in ) should only be used on objects..
[14:31:21] <necromancer> javascript is very strange when it handles global vars
[14:31:29] <necromancer> it's all based on scope
[14:31:39] <necromancer> like if you declare a variable just in a javascript file, that's a global variable
[14:31:49] <Jantire> That's what I want
[14:31:50] <necromancer> but if you declare it in a function of some sort, it only applies to that function
[14:31:59] <gym_jane> anyone know of any good cross browser 2 level vertical menus?
[14:32:00] <Jantire> I want all functions to be able to access the items
[14:32:05] <Jantire> well the current_item
[14:32:06] <necromancer> so all you have to do to make it a global is var <your-variable> = "blah";
[14:32:11] <necromancer> but just do it outside the DOM ready
[14:32:25] <Jantire> alrgiht
[14:32:32] <Jantire> This isn't working in Firefox though
[14:32:33] <Jantire> WHich is weird
[14:32:36] <necromancer> eyah
[14:32:37] <necromancer> yeah*
[14:32:38] <Jantire> there should be text between the two <>
[14:32:44] <necromancer> there used to be...not sure what happened
[14:32:59] <necromancer> oh there we go. try refreshing
[14:33:29] <Jantire> yeah
[14:33:31] <Jantire> it workes now
[14:33:35] <Jantire> *works
[14:34:00] <Jantire> but it's still not changing
[14:34:03] <Jantire> the <> I mean
[14:34:17] <necromancer> Jantire: do you know how to use console.log?
[14:34:35] <Jantire> no, I'm just learning how to use javascript
[14:34:39] <necromancer> oh ok
[14:34:50] <Jantire> but I"ll google it
[14:34:56] <necromancer> do you know any other programming languages? have you ever done a "trace" to find bad code?
[14:35:00] <phlp> Jantire: http://jsfiddle.net/AMabq/3
[14:35:46] <necromancer> Jantire: your .click() actions are working, it's your SetupHeadline function that's screwed up
[14:35:50] <Jantire> necromancer, I know C# decently, and am learning ruby
[14:35:59] <necromancer> oh ok
[14:36:01] <Jantire> phlp, I take it this is the javascript way of doing things?
[14:36:21] <Jantire> (judging by it looking like JSON)
[14:36:33] <phlp> SetupHeadline(window.headlines.current_item--)
[14:36:35] <necromancer> Jantire: that's a JavaScript object. well, one way of writing it :)
[14:36:44] <phlp> that is the problem.. current_item - 1 works
[14:36:49] <Jantire> ohhh
[14:36:51] <Jantire> okay
[14:37:04] <Jantire> thanks all
[14:37:24] <Jantire> and no, this isn't something for reddit
[14:37:32] <Jantire> I'm making a more readable UI of HN
[14:37:37] <Jantire> (HN == news.ycombinator.com)
[14:37:47] <madhat> systemfault: that worked :) thanks for helping me and introducing me to jsfiddle!
[14:37:59] <gym_jane> anyone know of any good cross browser 2 level vertical menus?
[14:38:52] <NuckingFuts> Hello again peoples.
[14:41:50] <NuckingFuts> I don't know how I could live without self-executing closures.
[14:43:58] <sic1> u know what, i think i would miss them also
[14:44:41] <BrandonZacharie> anyone have expierience with a good history manager?
[14:45:45] <sic1> in what context?
[14:45:55] <sic1> like history of the world? usa? mexico?
[14:46:05] <phlp> sounds like communism
[14:46:25] <BrandonZacharie> browser history
[14:46:37] <sic1> backbone.js comes to mind for single page stuff
[14:46:51] <sic1> ummm
[14:46:56] <sic1> use chrome?
[14:47:57] <BrandonZacharie> browser history management via javascript
[14:48:20] <BrandonZacharie> like hash change handling
[14:48:36] <phlp> u tryin to hax my history?
[14:48:58] <BrandonZacharie> i'm sing jQuery.bbq but i feel like its too buggy
[14:49:02] <BrandonZacharie> using*
[14:49:14] <NuckingFuts> What's this about a bbq in JS?
[14:49:16] <NuckingFuts> :P
[14:50:11] <sic1> then i would look at backbone.js
[14:50:47] <sic1> its controller IS a hash change history manager
[14:50:56] <sic1> would be a good starting point
[14:51:13] <phlp> BrandonZacharie: theres also this https://github.com/balupton/history.js never used it but it looks interesting
[14:51:49] <BrandonZacharie> sic1: i'm checking it out now
[14:53:25] <d1rt> BrandonZacharie: http://tkyk.github.com/jquery-history-plugin/   <-- I've used that one a bit, I like it, works well.
[14:53:39] <sic1> and if you are doing anything that is watching a hash change event in a single page app flow, you might wanna look into actually using all of backbone
[14:54:30] <NuckingFuts> I'm looking at doing a website using NodeJS backend and jQuery-based AJAX-driven frontend
[14:54:32] <sterna> hey how do i $("#idofsomediv").insert($("<p>")); ?
[14:54:47] <sterna> .append inserts a node after the current one, right?
[14:54:54] <d1rt> sterna: .html()
[14:55:14] <sterna> oh
[14:55:17] <sterna> thanks d1rt
[14:55:17] <NuckingFuts> And I was wondering if it's possible to do a selector in Sizzle which will execute the functions if the results change
[14:55:19] <d1rt> sterna: np
[14:55:53] <NuckingFuts> So basically, .live(), but more extensive, and with other functions
[14:56:12] <NuckingFuts> The big thing I'm wanting is a fallback to non-AJAX
[14:56:22] <sic1> im thinking
[14:56:27] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: I've been using delegate more, I like it.
[14:56:31] <BrandonZacharie> sic1, phlp, d1rt: for now i only want to use it on a single page for tracking pagination history here: movieclips.com/GoNjy
[14:56:43] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: http://api.jquery.com/delegate
[14:56:57] <NuckingFuts> Similar to what Facebook has, where it uses normal links, but keeps it from actually navigating, it just AJAXes the stuff, but if you reload, it loads the full page
[14:57:11] <sic1> execute the functions if the results change...? results change from what?
[14:57:13] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: I'm building that exact thing now, and it's a headache
[14:57:38] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: existing architecture needs to be more "AJAXY" to support single sessions without backend overhaul
[14:57:43] <sic1> hehe, im building out that stuff right now also...
[14:57:55] <sic1> built out my own MVC with localStorage backing...
[14:57:58] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: iframes have become the bane of my existence
[14:58:03] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: I would imagine, but .delegate (looks like .live, did it get a name-change?) looks reassuring
[14:58:14] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: frames are horrible
[14:58:18] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: well it let's you target and filter
[14:58:35] <sic1> i need to pop it into github...but all of us are really talking about some sort of MVC system with local storage backing on ajax calls
[14:58:41] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Is .delegate the same as .live?
[14:58:47] <NuckingFuts> Because I used .live before
[14:58:50] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: very similiar
[14:58:53] <sic1> delegate is the -ish
[14:59:24] <sic1> u can bind all ur handlers to the body, then specify which elements inside of the body, have which events
[14:59:26] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: $('body').delegate('a','click',function(evnt) { handleit });
[14:59:34] <sic1> there u go!
[14:59:37] <sic1> :)
[15:00:04] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Ah, that's helpful.  Do you know if the URL changes if I preventdefault?
[15:00:04] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: also nice because you could have a single handler reused for a lot of similar events
[15:00:15] <NuckingFuts> OR will I hafta set it manually somehow?
[15:00:51] <NuckingFuts> I really like the way Facebook does their AJAX more than the usual hashbang
[15:01:18] <NuckingFuts> I mean, hashbangs are nice, but they can be a pain to fallback
[15:01:28] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: so basically how I handled it was dynamic iframe for display and such it's a mess but essentially I load up a blank page, with history object and such, and load new pages in a dynamic iframe that I trash and create on the fly
[15:01:38] <sic1> lol, hashbang just sounds funny
[15:01:58] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: $iframe.load(function(){ $(this).contents().delegate('a','click',handle_click});
[15:01:59] <BrandonZacharie> better than hashnot
[15:02:07] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Ewwww that's ugly
[15:02:13] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: yea, I'm not proud
[15:02:19] <sic1> haha
[15:02:22] <NuckingFuts> I plan to have an API for my site's core
[15:02:26] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: it's either this or A LOT of serverside changes
[15:02:35] <sic1> what are you doin messin around with iframes?
[15:02:36] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: and that's not gonna happen.
[15:02:48] <sic1> iframe is another funny word to me
[15:02:54] <d1rt> sic1: I hate them too
[15:02:59] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: I'm building my thing from the ground up
[15:03:14] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: well then you can skip 90% of the issues I'm having
[15:03:16] <NuckingFuts> I'm debating between PHP or NodeJS
[15:03:31] <sic1> heh
[15:03:44] <NuckingFuts> NodeJS would be nice because it is better suited to the task of building an API, but PHP allows for WAY faster development
[15:03:51] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: been reading up on node, not sold on it _yet_, we debating replacing our ejabberd install with a xmpp node.js library
[15:03:51] <sic1> i've been thinking that one out for a project as well...just dont know if i have the time to learn nodeJS
[15:04:06] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: not sure how it performs against erlang
[15:04:09] <NuckingFuts> Oh, I've been working with NodeJS since 0.2.6
[15:04:13] <NuckingFuts> And I'm in love with it
[15:04:31] <sic1> well there u go
[15:04:35] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: I think erlang beats it in some benchmarks
[15:04:44] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: yea that's what I've read
[15:05:14] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Just remember that V8 is still not entirely done ;)
[15:05:21] <NuckingFuts> So there's a LOT of room to improve it
[15:05:27] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: yea, and it's a production service
[15:05:33] <NuckingFuts> IIRC, it still doesn't compile entirely
[15:05:35] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[15:05:42] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: hallo
[15:06:05] <NuckingFuts> Problem with using NodeJS for this task is having to make my own API skeleton
[15:06:06] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: that ejabberd server has been running for years, so to replace it with something that might not perform as well and is kind of unstable seems foolish
[15:06:09] <NuckingFuts> Which would be a pain :/
[15:06:38] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: as for the client side tho
[15:06:43] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: I'd wait for about 0.8 before using it to replace current systems
[15:07:07] <NuckingFuts> But as far as making new systems, it's stable enough for that.
[15:07:11] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: if your event handler with delegate, evnt.stopPropagation(); should prevent the default link navigating via browser
[15:07:30] <NuckingFuts> Plus the wonderful connections to MongoDB is mouthwateringly great.
[15:07:43] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: and then just pass the new "path" into the history lib, it handles the hashing and such
[15:08:02] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: But I hafta have it handle the history itself?
[15:08:09] <NuckingFuts> The browser doesn't automatically do that for me?
[15:08:13] <necromancer> NuckingFuts: pretty sure V8 is entirely done. it's node.js that isn't done
[15:08:23] <necromancer> i mean, as "done" as it can be
[15:08:33] <necromancer> it's the JS engine in Chrome, i'm sure it's not in a beta state
[15:08:53] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: it does, the library has hooks
[15:09:07] <NuckingFuts> necromancer: As I recall, it still doesn't compile everything.  I think it's still got some parts that are still suboptimal
[15:09:12] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: so you write your handlers there because you'll still need to do some minimal logic I'm guessing
[15:09:33] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Yeah, I'll need to turn a URL into an API call
[15:10:14] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: basically when the "hash" gets updated, you get an event back with the hash, then you make decisions based on it
[15:10:39] <necromancer> NuckingFuts: regardless, if you want to use something to run your whole site all the time i'd suggest PHP, not node.js
[15:10:43] <necromancer> if anything
[15:10:55] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: Wait, as in the #-stuffs?
[15:10:56] <d1rt> necromancer: agreed
[15:10:58] <necromancer> although sinatra/ruby would at least feel more like node.js
[15:11:15] <necromancer> i really like sinatra actually, it feels like you're rolling your own web framework
[15:11:16] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: so let's say for example you're aiming for failover
[15:11:26] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: so all your a tags are valid
[15:11:37] <NuckingFuts> necromancer: I'm thinking I might use a NodeJS API then build a PHP-based webserver
[15:11:49] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: <a href="/some/service/datahere">link</a>
[15:12:05] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: What are these hashes you keep talking about?
[15:12:08] <wkmanire> You use NodeJS because you want to, not because it is the best option.
[15:12:13] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: for the history library
[15:12:17] <TheEric> Is there a live equivalent to always apply a function to an element if the dom changes? e.g. Apply a function to an input element if a new element is added to the document ?
[15:12:17] <wkmanire> It isn't even close to being mature yet.
[15:12:20] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: weren't you the one asking about it?
[15:12:36] <phlp> i use node.js because i am hip and cool
[15:12:39] <Fretta> any idea why this isnt working, trying to use autocomplete: http://pastie.org/2049743
[15:12:49] <NuckingFuts> d1rt: I askedabout link overriding, somebody else asked specifically about the history stuff >_>
[15:13:01] <d1rt> NuckingFuts: ahh my bad
[15:13:05] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: Well, that too.  Also because it lets me have one steady DB connection
[15:13:56] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: And I can build better things in NodeJS than I can in PHP.  I can build API servers which are all independent and can be fired up quickly and shot in the head, etc.
[15:14:52] <NuckingFuts> And NodeJS can handle heavy lourds more effectively than PHP can.
[15:15:01] <wkmanire> Prove it.
[15:15:15] <wkmanire> Let's see the perf tests
[15:15:36] <wkmanire> Most performance problems are caused by developers, not by platforms.
[15:15:44] <Fretta> true
[15:15:52] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: Ummm, just look at any of the perf tests that have been done.  I've seen at least 10 different tests, all agreed that PHP is slower than NodeJS
[15:15:52] <Fretta> very true
[15:15:55] <TheEric> You're an absolute idiot if you think a client side scripting language can replace a server side component.
[15:16:13] <Fretta> no very true to wkmanire its the developer not the platoform
[15:16:18] <NuckingFuts> TheEric: You're an absolute idiot if you think that it makes any difference :V
[15:16:38] <NuckingFuts> Fretta: It's true, but platforms can only go so fast
[15:16:44] <TheEric> There must be a server side component of some sort.
[15:16:47] <NuckingFuts> And PHP isn't exactly the most efficient ;)
[15:17:08] <NuckingFuts> TheEric: That's what NodeJS is.  There's nothing saying you can't use the same language in two places.
[15:17:16] <dipser> TheEric: Youre the idiot #node.js
[15:17:47] <Fretta> any kideas why this autocomplete isnt working http://pastie.org/2049743
[15:19:01] <phlp> is that it guys? was just getting good
[15:19:10] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: PHP spins up new threads (or is it processes?) for requests, whereas NodeJS maintains a threadpool.  This reduces overhead.
[15:19:31] <Fretta> phlp those debates end up going no where  :P
[15:19:39] <Fretta> but are entertaining
[15:19:44] <NuckingFuts> Plus PHP's compiler isn't very fast
[15:19:51] <wkmanire> compiler?
[15:19:52] <dipser> NuckingFuts: I agree, that node.js is cool.... but php is much easier and faster to write code with
[15:19:55] <NuckingFuts> Well, interpreter
[15:20:15] <NuckingFuts> There's a lot of blur between those two things
[15:20:23] <phlp> node.js = single threaded
[15:20:26] <NuckingFuts> dipser: It's easer to code for, I agree
[15:20:33] <NuckingFuts> phlp: Um, no.
[15:20:37] <NuckingFuts> It's got a threadpool
[15:20:41] <NuckingFuts> Like 5-10 thread
[15:20:49] <NuckingFuts> IT pushes I/O onto threads
[15:20:59] <dipser> I have written some node.js  and it gets really unreadable over the time
[15:21:00] <NuckingFuts> The majority of code is on one thread
[15:21:10] <wkmanire> I don't like these debates in here because we have a lot of people pop in, ask a question and pop out.
[15:21:31] <wkmanire> So they come in and see "NodeJS is superior blah blah blah"
[15:21:34] <wkmanire> and then leave.
[15:21:37] <NuckingFuts> lolwat
[15:21:53] <NuckingFuts> wkmanire: Who the hell would leave for such a silly reason? :|
[15:22:07] <wkmanire> NuckingFuts: You misunderstood.
[15:22:10] <gnarf> either way, this isn't a channel about node.js ;)
[15:22:22] <wkmanire> THey come in, ask a basic topic related question get there answer then leave
[15:22:22] <gnarf> debates are cool tho
[15:22:27] <wkmanire> and in between they get a bunch of opinions from *experts*
[15:22:32] <gnarf> thanks for some info in there NuckingFuts
[15:22:38] <gnarf> its nice to see you like something
[15:22:41] * gnarf grins
[15:22:45] <NuckingFuts> gnarf: lol
[15:22:45] * wkmanire chuckles.
[15:22:59] <wkmanire> their*
[15:23:03] * NuckingFuts presses the like button next to jQuery's name
[15:23:38] <Fretta> presses the like button lol!
[15:23:40] <NuckingFuts> I also think NodeJS is better than PHP because their chat has only one # in front lol
[15:24:12] <NuckingFuts> (plus I feel all hipstery with NodeJS) ;-)
[15:24:24] <dipser> not for long ^^
[15:24:29] <phlp> NuckingFuts: i dont know man everything ive seen suggests single thread. even http://nodejs.org says "Aren't threads necessary to scale programs to multi-core computers? Processes are necessary to scale to multi-core computers, not memory-sharing threads."
[15:25:04] <Fretta> how many web frameworks are there these days
[15:25:15] <Fretta> my guess => tons!
[15:25:16] <NuckingFuts> phlp: It's multi-threaded.
[15:25:33] <NuckingFuts> I can tell you that from experience and from having talked to the guys who've worked on building NodeJS ;)
[15:25:49] <Fretta> and NodeJS is just one of the thousands, personal preference....
[15:26:05] <dipser> Fretta wrong
[15:26:40] <NuckingFuts> I've spent years learning JS, and now that I'm fluent, I'm happily using NodeJS for these things :P
[15:26:41] <Fretta> dipser ?
[15:26:42] <dipser> node.js is not like jquery, mootools and co
[15:26:50] <TheEric> still talking about this inane rubbish? blah. You should probably continue it in the appropriate subject chan, eh?
[15:27:10] <Fretta> jQuery isnt a webframework
[15:27:44] <Fretta> dipser ^
[15:27:45] <evilmonkey> I dont know if this is the right place, but I am trying to add a feature to an existing plugin.  Since I dont know the first thing about jquery, I was hoping someone here could help me.
[15:28:07] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: Which plugin/feature?
[15:28:33] <evilmonkey> its sweet pages pagination plugin
[15:28:46] <evilmonkey> i just need to add a next and previous button
[15:28:48] <Tallisman> How do you remove an array element by it's index? (item[2]) or something?
[15:29:11] <evilmonkey> http://tutorialzine.com/2010/05/sweet-pages-a-jquery-pagination-solution/
[15:29:13] <NuckingFuts> Tallisman: IIRC, it's usually done with Array.splice
[15:29:21] <Tallisman> without splice :p
[15:29:28] <Tallisman> it is a chararray
[15:29:29] <NuckingFuts> Since delete doesn't work on Arrays, I think?
[15:29:32] <NuckingFuts> chararray?
[15:29:35] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: Looking
[15:29:39] <evilmonkey> thanks
[15:29:52] <Tallisman> well, string = "bla"; string[0] == "b"
[15:30:04] <NuckingFuts> Tallisman: That's nonstandard, I think.
[15:30:22] <Tallisman> maar .splice doesn't quite exist in that context
[15:30:24] <NuckingFuts> I'm pretty sure there's a way to splice a string or something >_>
[15:30:56] <Tallisman> hmmm
[15:31:37] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: If you look at the source where they are assigning the anonymous click handler to the anchors in the hyperLInks array
[15:31:44] <wkmanire> You will see what is required to show a page.
[15:32:23] <wkmanire> Unfortunately I don't see that they have a "pageNext" or "pagePrev" pair of functions for you to use.
[15:32:31] <evilmonkey> k
[15:32:44] <DewiMorgan> Q: I'm shifting points relative to a background map image, using: $(".point").css({left: $(".point").offset().left + $("#map_image").offset().left + "px"}); but it moves them all relative to the FIRST point. Is there some "each item in the list" identifier I should use instead of the second $(".point")? Or some way of iterating over each item separately?
[15:33:13] <wkmanire> What you can do is run a selector that gets those plugins.
[15:33:17] <wkmanire> sorry, those anchors.
[15:33:39] <DewiMorgan> A selector?
[15:33:58] <Tallisman> $("selector").
[15:34:25] <Tallisman> but he didn't mean that I see now.
[15:34:26] <wkmanire> evilmonkey:  So, after the paginator has finished initializing it self you can get those anchors, then keep an index variable that you move back and forth with a prev and next function.
[15:35:02] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: Then you can do something like pageAnchor[++pageIndex].click()
[15:35:07] <wkmanire> and pageAnchor[--pageIndex].click()
[15:35:21] <wkmanire> To force the widget to switch pages using its internal implementation.
[15:35:45] <Tallisman> does anyone know how to remove an character from a string without build in functions?
[15:35:53] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: He he, got all that?
[15:35:58] <evilmonkey> no
[15:35:58] <evilmonkey> lol
[15:36:03] <Rahly> yes but builtin functions will be faster
[15:36:27] <Tallisman> mwah, that doesn't matter I think, how? :P
[15:36:33] <DewiMorgan> Hrm - I think the answer to my question is a foreach(getElementsByTagName()), looping over them rather than trying to do them all in one fell swoop. I'll try that.
[15:38:06] <Phrogz_> Tallisman: Remove a character from a string "without built in functions"? What does that mean?
[15:38:14] <polyrhythmic> Tallisman: String.replace()
[15:38:24] <wkmanire> evilmonkey: To summarize then, that paginator attaches click events to the anchors which switches the pages.
[15:38:25] <DewiMorgan> Hrm - can you do a foreach over a selector? That would be nice.
[15:38:28] <Phrogz_> "Can someone tell me how to write code without using any built-in code?"
[15:38:44] <Phrogz_> Tallisman: str = str.replace(/a/g, ''); // remove every 'a' character
[15:38:47] <wkmanire> you just to need to manually fire click events on them sequentially with a ford and backbutton.
[15:38:53] <wkmanire> forward*
[15:39:11] <kranZ> im trying to get a script working that only reloads a div with jQuery.load when the content changed... it works for the first time, but when it stats the loop some variables are undefined
[15:39:12] * Phrogz_ prefers his Chevy button.
[15:39:13] <kranZ> http://pastebin.com/jVvDmnWN
[15:41:59] <BrandonZacharie> Tallisman: (function(s,c){ var r = ''; for(var i = 0, l = s.length; i !== l; ++i) if (s[i] !== c) r += s[i]; return r; })('test', 't')
[15:42:15] <Tallisman> O.O
[15:42:31] <BrandonZacharie> Tallisman: no use of builtin functions
[15:42:46] <Tallisman> thanks :O, I'll check it out now ^^
[15:43:41] <evilmonkey> wkmanire: sorry, im not ignoring you, just trying to figure this out
[15:43:41] <BrandonZacharie> Tallisman: doesn't work in IE because you can't treat strings as character arrays
[15:44:32] <BrandonZacharie> Tallisman: you will need to use string.charAt(index) instead of string[index] to solve the IE problem
[15:45:02] <BrandonZacharie> Tallisman: but then you'd be using a builtin function lol :P
[15:46:14] <pl0sh> hey guys, how can I bind this code:?   $("select#tipo option[value=test").attr('selected', 'selected');
[15:46:40] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: what do you mean by bind?
[15:46:49] <pl0sh> I mean, it normally works, but if the html file where I have that code is loaded thrown ajax that piece of code doesn't work
[15:46:50] <BrandonZacharie> ?bind
[15:47:19] <pl0sh> by saying ajax I mean $.ajax( );
[15:47:56] <pl0sh> through*
[15:48:41] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie any idea?
[15:48:47] <Woet> pl0sh: javascript is not executed
[15:48:51] <Woet> if you load it through ajax
[15:48:53] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: if you mean that it doesn't work because has been dynamically replaced via ajax then you can use .live to solve that
[15:48:54] <Woet> generally
[15:49:34] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie yes, I normally use live for clicks, but how can I use live for this piece of code?
[15:49:48] <Tallisman> if ( str[i] !== c ) <-- c?
[15:50:08] <pl0sh> $("select#tipo option[value=test").attr('selected', 'selected'); <-- this needs to be executed on document ready
[15:51:08] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: if you mean that it doesn't work because it is inside the ajaxed page then you will need to refactor that code out and into the parent page making the request first
[15:51:34] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie that's correct
[15:52:16] <pl0sh> how could I do that?
[15:52:33] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: here's an example...
[15:54:39] <sterna> .html replaces content of a dom node
[15:54:49] <sterna> how can i add another sibling to dom node's children?
[15:54:50] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: getNextPage() { ... .ajax(...) ... place html into $('div')... execute bindings... return  }
[15:55:38] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie makes sense, let try it, thank you :D
[15:55:49] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: in essence you can just rebind after each request
[15:58:30] <nguyendh> is there a way to programmatically add a new tab (jquery ui) at specific index ?
[15:59:23] <nguyendh> $("#myTab").tabs("add", newId, newLabel); -> always add the new tab at the end of existing tabs
[15:59:53] <BrandonZacharie> nguyendh: you could just move the tab after that
[16:00:43] <nguyendh> BrandonZacharie, thanks,
[16:01:26] <revnoah> does anyone here have experience with jquery mobile on blackberry os 5.0? I'm having trouble with the back button, and wondering if there is some other way to that event should be called.
[16:03:15] <Ripp__> Does anyone know of an irc-style chat client/frontend written in jQuery? Trying to find one to learn from and figure out how to write my own
[16:04:39] <Tallisman> .append
[16:05:02] <Tallisman> wrong chat, exuse me.
[16:19:14] <BrandonZacharie> Ripp__: i suggest you start here: http://bellard.org/jslinux/
[16:20:23] <Ripp__> BrandonZacharie: Thanks. That looks like a great place to start.
[16:20:32] <BrandonZacharie> Ripp__: you'll need an x86 emulator to start off with
[16:22:45] <Ripp__> Actually, that looks way more advanced than what I'm looking for
[16:23:11] <Ripp__> I'd probably be better off learning to port qwebirc from mootools to jquery, i think
[16:26:37] <sdouble> is there recent documentation to download for offline browsing?
[16:27:20] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie didn't work as expected
[16:27:48] <gym_jane> anyone familiar with superfish menu?
[16:28:22] <devinrolsen> doesn't that come with a lot of wordpress themes gym_jane?
[16:28:34] <devinrolsen> I am not familiar with it, just heard of it.
[16:28:35] <gym_jane> devinrolsen i think so
[16:28:47] <devinrolsen> whats the issue?
[16:29:14] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie http://pastebin.com/6q45pk85 <-- this is the code I am using..
[16:29:52] <gym_jane> i got a 2 level vertical menu. On hover i can see the submenu but i need to make the submenu constantly visible if its parent is set to "active"
[16:30:09] <gym_jane> does that make sense?
[16:30:28] <gym_jane> class="active"
[16:32:37] <devinrolsen> $("select#status option[value="+valEstatus+"]").attr('selected', 'selected'); to $('select#status option[value="'+valEstatus+'"]').attr('selected', 'selected'); will fix who ever just posted that pastebin
[16:32:42] <devinrolsen> sorry ff crashed.
[16:34:19] <devinrolsen> also, please done ever call the element out if its using an id, there is not need and it makes the browsers work harder. #status option should be just fine.
[16:34:20] <pl0sh> devinrolsen thanks
[16:34:29] <devinrolsen> no need*
[16:34:31] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: i'm looking into it
[16:35:00] <devinrolsen> man I can't type today :\
[16:35:23] <devinrolsen> who had the menu issue prior to my ff crashing?
[16:35:46] <devinrolsen> something about class="active" to expose sub menus.
[16:36:39] <devinrolsen> the selectors I would use to do such a thing would be li ul {display:none;} and then with js adding the active class to li, this selector would be the one to expose the submenu li.active ul {display:block;}
[16:36:42] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: do you get the alert that you have on line 10?
[16:37:03] <Phrogz> devinrolsen: gym_jane
[16:37:08] <pl0sh> BrandonZacharie yes, I do, but I think the real issue was the missing ""
[16:37:18] <pl0sh> which was notified by devinrolsen
[16:37:24] <devinrolsen> ahh yes, thanks Phrogz. Did you get that gym_jane?
[16:37:24] <gym_jane> janthony me devinrolsen
[16:38:12] <janthony> huh?
[16:38:38] <Tallisman> hmm, if you hit a infinite loop in jsfiddle, do you lose all your progress?
[16:38:49] <devinrolsen> if I understood you correctly, you wanted the submenu that lives in a list item to be exposed with the list item has a class of "active", correct?
[16:39:06] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: yes, it is
[16:39:11] <DewiMorgan> Q: How do I convert one of the objects returned by .getElementsByTagName() to a jquery object? I could do $("#"+myObj.id) but they don't have IDs. I could *give* them all IDs, but is there a better way?
[16:39:27] <pl0sh> thank you guys, it was really freaking me out, ahaha
[16:39:55] <systemfault> DewiMorgan: Have you tried the obvious?
[16:39:56] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: you probably need quotes around the value with the version of jQuery you are using
[16:39:58] <Tallisman> So, do you lose all progress when hitting an infinite loop in jsfiddle?
[16:40:12] <systemfault> DewiMorgan: $(myObj) ?
[16:40:24] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: that requirement was changed in jQuery this year
[16:41:26] <devinrolsen> BrandonZacharie, you are correct... but I still have yet to run into an instance where using them with out the double quotes works..
[16:41:29] <devinrolsen> so I always use them.
[16:41:55] <gym_jane> devinrolsen i believe it is this part of superfish code that i need to modify http://jsfiddle.net/LJjLr/
[16:42:01] <gym_jane> however am not sure what/how to do it
[16:42:04] <BrandonZacharie> pl0sh: try $('... option[value="' + val + '"]').attr(...)
[16:42:07] <pl0sh> I see, that's why
[16:42:35] <Tallisman> Is it possible to stop an infinite javascript loop? without killing the page?
[16:43:01] <DewiMorgan> systemfault: yeah, tried that and it said it was null... no, thinking about it, it said that the variable I was calling was null. I probably did something wrong. Lemme fiddle a bit and maybe come back with a less stupid question :)
[16:43:01] <Tallisman> because I typed a little to much without saving in jsfiddle.
[16:43:03] <systemfault> Tallisman: No.
[16:43:17] <devinrolsen> Yeah sorry I got nothing from that gym_jane.
[16:43:23] <Tallisman> Soo.. It's gone?
[16:43:26] <systemfault> Tallisman: Then just wait
[16:43:39] <BrandonZacharie> devinrolsen: older versions of jQuery
[16:43:41] <systemfault> Tallisman: After a few second, your browser you give you a prompt
[16:43:49] <systemfault> Tallisman: If you want to stop the script.
[16:43:49] <Tallisman> kill or wait :p
[16:44:04] <pl0sh> that worked, it was the quotes, I was obsolete  :D
[16:45:35] <Tallisman> note to self, Never loop in jsfiddle ever again. >.<, there is no other option than killing
[16:45:51] <Tallisman> it's like the system crash for the web rofl
[16:46:25] <Tallisman> was hoping for a timeout, unfortunatly..
[16:48:23] <Tallisman> okey, that is the last time i'm developing on jsfiddle x
[16:48:37] <Tallisman> I feel like a kid who just lost all his files XD
[16:49:32] <Tallisman> hey wait, I just lost 2 hours of work xD, due to an infinite loop =), first time for everything hehehe
[16:50:13] <gym_jane> hate menus
[16:51:29] <gym_jane> devinrolsen i am using the menu as this guy http://templatesden.com/TF/html/hansum/
[16:51:36] <gym_jane> same*
[16:52:11] <gym_jane> what i want is, if i am on lets say http://templatesden.com/TF/html/hansum/portfolio.html
[16:52:27] <gym_jane> then because "portfolio" is active the submenu should be visible
[16:58:30] <gym_jane> can anyone please help?
[17:00:05] <jonathansampson> gym_jane You can do this with CSS.
[17:00:37] <jonathansampson> In the body tag, append the parent name as a class.
[17:00:44] <jonathansampson> <body class="portfolio">
[17:01:05] <gym_jane> ok
[17:01:11] <jonathansampson> Within your styles do something like this: body.portfolio a.portfolio { /* active styles */ }
[17:01:42] <jonathansampson> Anytime you are are the portfolio page, where "portfolio" is a classname on <body/>, the link with the same class will appear activated.
[17:02:09] <jonathansampson> Anytime you are on a sub-page, set the body to reflect a classname matching the parent of the sub-page.
[17:02:24] <gym_jane> its not about setting the first menu item as active
[17:02:34] <jonathansampson> Hope that makes since. If you're on Portfolio, body.portfolio, and if you're on Portfolio > Portfolio 2, body.portfolio.
[17:02:43] <gym_jane> i am trying to make the submenu visible if its parent is active
[17:03:05] <jonathansampson> body.portfolio li.portfolio ul.submenu { display:block }
[17:03:15] <jonathansampson> Same concept.
[17:07:06] <jonathansampson> gym_jane Any luck implementing that solution?
[17:07:19] <gym_jane> unfortuantely not
[17:07:24] <gym_jane> duh can't even type :/
[17:07:35] <jonathansampson> What seems to be the problem?
[17:07:52] <gym_jane> the thing is this has to be done through jquery
[17:07:52] <jonathansampson> By default you have li ul.submenu { display:none }
[17:08:02] <gym_jane> otherwise it is going to be mess in wordpress
[17:08:10] <jonathansampson> After that add the following: body.product li.product ul.submenu { display:block }
[17:08:31] <jonathansampson> WordPress already adds the class names to the body tag.
[17:08:43] <jonathansampson> I think via the body_class() function.
[17:09:36] <jonathansampson> Just confirmed, WP does provide body_class() to automatically add relevant class names to the body tag.
[17:09:59] <jonathansampson> http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/body_class
[17:11:22] <gym_jane> tried this li.current a ul li {
[17:11:23] <gym_jane> 	display:block
[17:11:25] <gym_jane> }
[17:11:28] <gym_jane> but it doesn't work
[17:12:16] <jonathansampson> Bust open Firebug to get a better feel for which classNames and IDs you should be using :)
[17:16:58] <gym_jane> when i hover on the menu item Superfish adds "sfHover" class to make the submenu fade in
[17:19:58] <Adman65> does live work custom events?
[17:23:31] <gym_jane> this works .sf-menu li.current ul { color:black}
[17:23:40] <gym_jane> but display:block doesn't do anything
[17:33:12] <K1ng> what is the best form validator?
[17:58:40] <K1ng> what is the best form validator?
[18:03:53] <GoGoGarrett> Do you think Templates will ever become apart of core?
[18:09:10] * jonathansampson has returned.
[18:09:15] <jonathansampson> Hello, all.
[18:09:59] <GoGoGarrett> Hewweo
[18:11:50] <sdouble> is there recent documentation to download for offline browsing?
[18:15:30] <GoGoGarrett> I wish there was an online source of test problems to solve using jquery.  if there is..i haven't found it yet haha
[18:17:41] <zeve> hey, anyone with experience using cache.manifest files?
[18:31:39] <devinrolsen> evening all
[19:02:41] <devinrolsen> so quiet in here.
[19:26:22] <GoGoGarrett> For real
[20:03:55] <libertyfire> Hello, I'm using JQuery 1.6.1 and when I call $.ajax with a 'json' dataType it parses the response as text instead of json, what's wrong here? code: http://pastebin.com/2TSSdpPm
[20:06:40] <libertyfire> I also verified the response is Valid JSON
[20:26:00] <sam113101> I have two problems, I get a jump when I slideDown(), and I can't get() ajax, it doesn't work
[20:26:59] <sam113101> http://jsfiddle.net/BJcdP/
[20:27:03] <sam113101> here is my code
[20:34:08] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/BJcdP/1/  this is what i've messed with, nothing major, but the slide up/down looks fine to me
[20:34:42] <GoGoGarrett> Idk, why the ajax isn't working, I think you have to do something specific for ajax in jsfiddle, theres a tab on the left testing ajax request, i'd recommend redaing
[20:37:29] <libertyfire> I'm using JQuery 1.6.1 and when I call $.ajax with a 'json' dataType it parses the response as text instead of json, what's wrong here? code: http://pastebin.com/2TSSdpPm
[20:38:48] <sam113101> the bump is still there
[20:39:10] <sam113101> I read that it's about unknown height
[20:39:40] <sam113101> I found a fix, didn't try it though
[20:40:16] <sam113101> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/slidedown-animation-jump-revisited/
[20:40:32] <sam113101> I'm wondering why it isn't fixed by now¬†?
[20:48:02] <libertyfire> Is JQuery 1.6.1 stable?
[20:49:38] <sam113101> I think that it's my php file
[20:51:21] <txt23> I have a custom.js file and I need to remove only jquery code from it is there an easy way to do this?
[20:53:41] <chovy> can i put html into a data attribute?
[20:58:23] <zoggy> so whats the proper way now in 1.6.1 to see if an option is selected
[20:58:57] <zoggy> this doesnt appear to be right anymore: $("#blah option:selected").length
[21:05:02] <libertyfire> Why do I have to say $.parseJSON(XHR.responseText)); When I already specified 'json' as a dataType and am returning valid JSON?
[21:05:19] <libertyfire> This is after calling $.ajax
[21:21:09] <chovy> libertyfire: why not just .getJSON(url, data, callback);
[21:22:11] <astropirate> does jquery allow one to read/write anobject/hash to the elements data-name attribute?
[21:22:31] <astropirate> when i read it it isn't an object its a type string
[21:38:54] <Hilton> How is this wrong, and how do I make it work? $('#size_'+($(this).attr('name'))).remove;
[21:39:27] <Hilton> The goal is when a button with a name value of, say, "4" is clicked, that the #size_4 div is deleted.
[21:39:49] <GoGoGarrett> not sure, but try this
[21:40:14] <GoGoGarrett> $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#size_'+( $(this).attr('name') ) )end().remoe;
[21:40:19] <GoGoGarrett> crap
[21:40:26] <GoGoGarrett> haha, basically try to add .end() after the attr
[21:40:54] <Hilton> I thought that embedding the second $() in its own parenthesis would solve that...?
[21:41:16] <GoGoGarrett> Perhaps i'm not certian
[21:43:00] <eubey> Can someone please help me with some basic string variable manipulation? need to wrap some a tags in a ul to do a carousel with nivo, having some trouble and I know its not diffucult if you know the right syntax... http://pastebin.com/EAAWn161
[21:45:05] <GoGoGarrett> well for one, it's remove()
[21:45:19] <GoGoGarrett> but i'm not sure, post your code to like jsfiddle so i can look at it
[21:50:06] <GoGoGarrett> Hilton http://jsfiddle.net/kfJpd/
[21:53:40] <mshadle> what's the easiest way for a checkbox to trigger an event only when it's clicked on?
[21:54:16] <_beau> $('.checkboxClass').click()
[21:54:25] <_beau> same as everything else really
[21:54:26] <mshadle> yeah i need to combine :checked in there
[21:54:32] <_beau> why
[21:54:49] <_beau> go caveman on that shit
[21:54:53] <mshadle> ha
[21:55:02] <_beau> unless you dont know if its going to be checked by default on page load
[21:55:10] <_beau> in which case
[21:55:24] <_beau> $('.checkboxShit:checked').click()
[21:55:31] <_beau> which would be unchecking it
[21:55:53] <_beau> or i could be retarded
[21:56:06] <mshadle> got it
[21:56:08] <mshadle> if($(this).is(":checked"))
[21:56:27] <mshadle> i thought i tried that inside of the .click but it wouldnt work. i tried that last one you mentioned it didn't seem to work.
[22:15:02] <Hilton> GoGoGarrett: Isn't that exactly the same code I posted? How come mine doesn't work?...
[22:15:13] <GoGoGarrett> You didn't have remove.();
[22:15:16] <GoGoGarrett> just minior syntax
[22:15:27] <GoGoGarrett> remove() *
[22:15:51] <Hilton> oh ffs
[22:15:54] <Hilton> Okay
[22:16:48] <Hilton> Any way to combine slideUp() and remove()? I just tried .sliedUp().remove(), but it just removes immediately...
[22:16:55] <Hilton> Or do I need to do it on two separate lines?
[22:17:35] <GoGoGarrett> hmm, try putting a .slideUp().delay(2000).remove()
[22:17:37] <GoGoGarrett> perhaps
[22:17:56] <GoGoGarrett> or, slideUp(2000).remove() i'm not sure if that'd do it alone
[22:21:18] <Hilton> toremove = '#size' + ($(this).attr('name')); $(toremove).slideUp(500, function(){$(toremove).remove()});
[22:21:20] <Hilton> that did it
[23:12:02] <zeve> hi folks
[23:12:40] <zeve> im trying to set a timeout paramater on a jquery ajax call
[23:13:30] <zeve> in order to determine whether or not a user is connected to the internet. however, it still runs the success: function instead of going to error: - any idea why?
[23:16:11] <zeve> anyone talk in these rooms lol
[23:17:55] <Hilton> Nope
[23:18:08] <Hilton> The ops are considering changing the name to #idlersonly

[23:18:48] <zeve> =\
[23:20:21] <zeve> any idea on my problem hilton:?
[23:20:50] <Hilton> DEL *.* and forget about it?
[23:21:00] <zeve> ?
[23:21:18] <Hilton> Oh sorry, Linux user? rm * and forget about it.
[23:29:25] <Hilton> What's a quick way to loop through a set of elements and replace "**" with another string in every id/name?
