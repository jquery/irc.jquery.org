[00:45:07] <Lundy> morning guys im just wondering if anyone could give me abit of help here... im looking for a kinda of flip I dont even know what you would call it .. basically when I click on a text input a like "popup" would appear displaying a selection of options ... Iv searched modals but they are all the ones that fade the background and all thats not what im looking
[00:45:48] <[1]PrinceES> yes
[00:45:58] <hooloovoo> Lundy: Jquery UI 1.9 has that.
[00:46:26] <hooloovoo> Lundy: Check if there's a beta or git/svn trunk you can grab.

[00:53:38] <fruitbat> Is there an issue filtering for html5 data attributes in 1.5.1? I'm trying to find items that have data attributes on them but the following doesn't work: $('*[attr^="data"]')
[00:54:35] <Cork> fruitbat: you can't search on atrtibute names
[00:54:39] <Cork> *attribute
[00:54:54] <Cork> the syntax is *[data-something]
[00:55:33] <mytoz> or just $('[data-foo="bar"]')
[00:55:41] <ravenzz> fruitbat $('[data-foo]')
[00:55:58] <Cork> in other words, you can't do a generic search for data-*
[00:56:14] <ravenzz> otherwhise you should select everything and filter that by its attributes
[00:58:13] <fruitbat> ok thanks. Just converting loads of stuff from css classes to data attrbutes, might hace to keep a few classes for identification.
[00:58:47] <fruitbat> *wishes he could type*
[01:02:49] <fruitbat> can I ask people for feedback on a plugin?

[01:30:07] <mattharrison> Why does: alert('something') happen on page load when it's part of a function that hasn't been called?
[01:30:35] <Cork> mattharrison: it doesn't
[01:30:54] <Cork> either you have syntax errors causing it, or its called from somewhere you didn't expect
[01:30:59] <aavikkojootti> function is being called
[01:33:54] <mattharrison> Not sure if I got a reply then, lost connection. Anyone any ideas?
[01:34:26] <fruitbat> point a breakpoint of the line and see whats calling it
[01:34:34] <AdvoWork> Hi there. Ive got some working code: <button id="create-user">Create new user</button> and $( "#create-user" ).button().click(function() {	$( "#dialog-form" ).dialog( "open" );}); which opens a dialog on the button. Any idea how I can use an image instead of a button though? Cant find anything
[01:35:12] <fruitbat> <img id="create-user" src="" />
[01:35:27] <fruitbat> or put an image inside the button

[01:39:51] <B_Lizzard> Hi, I'm trying to use .replace and a regxp to replace every instance of a string in the form "slide-[number]" where number starts from 0 and will probably never go over 99.
[01:39:56] <B_Lizzard> My current code is this:
[01:40:16] <B_Lizzard> .replace(/slide-([0-9]|[1-9][0-9])/g, id));
[01:40:18] <muzone> I'm trying to get the width of an UL, then set that width on it, plus a margin-left: [width/2]. Is this correct? var w = $("ul").width(); $("ul").width(w); $("ul").margin-left(w/2);
[01:41:01] <B_Lizzard> But it only replaces the first digit.
[01:41:46] <B_Lizzard> Or maybe, it alwatys leaves the last digit out.
[01:41:51] <Cork> B_Lizzard: try something like .replace(/slide-([0-9]{1,3})/g, id));
[01:42:02] <B_Lizzard> OK...
[01:42:49] <B_Lizzard> Same thing
[01:43:34] <Cork> ?eval "slide-1 slide-2, slide-3, slide-4, slide-5, slide-56".replace(/slide-([0-9]{1,3})/g, id);
[01:43:35] <B_Lizzard> Replacing a single digit to another single digit or a double digit goes well.
[01:44:05] <Cork> bah the bot is dead
[01:44:12] <B_Lizzard> Heh
[01:44:23] <coldhead> he's not dead, he's just resting
[01:44:28] <coldhead> he's pining for the fjords
[01:44:40] <Cork> B_Lizzard: this works for me "slide-1 slide-2, slide-3, slide-4, slide-5, slide-56".replace(/slide-([0-9]{1,3})/g, "slide-10");
[01:45:04] <B_Lizzard> Lemme see, then.
[01:45:20] <muzone> I'm trying to get the width of an UL, then set that width on it, plus a margin-left: [width/2]. Is this correct? var w = $("ul").width(); $("ul").width(w); $("ul").css(margin-left, w/2);
[01:45:49] <muzone> Please y'all
[01:46:00] <Cork> not interesting in waising my time
[01:46:08] <B_Lizzard> Works for me in Firebug, too.
[01:46:12] <B_Lizzard> :/
[01:46:18] <B_Lizzard> I'll look into it.
[01:46:23] <B_Lizzard> Thanks, Cork.
[01:46:27] <Cork> np
[01:46:34] <muzone> Cork: was that for me or B_Lizzard?

[01:52:18] <muzone> pull that cork outta your ass though, little geek as motherfucker
[01:52:23] <muzone> in real life i'd fuck you up
[01:52:26] <muzone> how is that for rude?
[01:52:29] <muzone> bitch
[01:52:42] <Cork> there you are, now your showing your normal colors
[01:53:04] <blackspotwiggins> it's funny because i don't see what he did/said
[01:53:16] <youngin> yeah me neither
[01:53:24] <youngin> Cork why won't you show us
[01:53:36] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: its been streched out over multible channels, over weeks
[01:53:37] <coldhead> seriously Cork is a shit
[01:53:40] <coldhead> but he's our shit
[01:53:46] <coldhead> our precious darling shit
[01:53:49] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, yeah i know who he is
[01:54:02] <blackspotwiggins> didnt know about multple channels tho
[01:54:13] <youngin> blackspotwiggins: who is he?
[01:54:23] <coldhead> you shouldn't be on multiple channels
[01:54:30] <Cork> lol
[01:54:32] <coldhead> it's treasonous
[01:54:42] <coldhead> stay with your own kind
[01:54:53] <B_Lizzard> INTENSE!
[01:55:02] <B_Lizzard> In any case, it worked perfectly.
[01:55:09] <B_Lizzard> Thanks for the code snippet, Cork.
[01:55:23] <Cork> heh, it was basically your own
[01:56:09] * muzone is now playing: http://home.no/mritz/bitches_brewin.mp3
[01:56:14] <Trisox> any one ever worked with this ? https://github.com/kflorence/jquery-wizard/
[01:56:23] * Cork wonder if he should start giving back users there own code and see if that fixes there problem :D
[01:56:24] * muzone dances around Cork
[01:56:24] <Trisox> i try to get multiple branches
[01:57:18] <Cork> Trisox: wow, nice
[01:57:20] <youngin> muzone: cool song
[01:57:28] <Trisox> thats a plugin..
[01:57:40] <Cork> i that one existed a few months back i would prob have userd it :)
[01:57:52] <Cork> Trisox: ya, i know
[01:57:56] <Cork> http://kflorence.github.com/jquery-wizard/examples/
[01:58:06] <Trisox> http://vospascal.nl/wizard/examples/
[01:58:17] <Cork> but thats fundamentaly what i do my self
[01:58:20] <Trisox> more then one branche ... not posible
[01:58:27] <muzone> I'm trying to get the width of an UL, then set that width on it, plus a margin-left: [width/2]. Is this correct? var w = $("ul").width(); $("ul").width(w); $("ul").css(margin-left, w/2);
[01:58:34] <Trisox> how did you do it?
[01:59:04] <Cork> Trisox: ajax calls, and a serializeArray wrapper
[01:59:27] <Cork> each wizard step stors its form values into a big array, that at the end is sent to the server
[01:59:28] <Trisox> any preview?
[01:59:45] <Cork> pulling the next step in the wizard from the server
[02:00:06] <Cork> and at the end sending the complete array
[02:00:34] <Trisox> i would like it to be not the case..
[02:00:51] <Cork> you want to store it localy?
[02:00:53] <youngin> muzone: whats this http://home.no/mritz/shit_is_pretty.pdf
[02:00:58] <Cork> that is all sent from the start?
[02:01:16] <muzone> oh that, just some notes a friend made
[02:01:59] <Ankabout> can someone help me make a div element change on hovering, but only if you hover on the bottom 50% of the element?
[02:02:03] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/yYwYv/1/
[02:02:28] <Trisox> update 1 sec
[02:03:07] <Trisox> Cork more like this http://vospascal.nl/wizard/examples/
[02:07:27] <Cork> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/yYwYv/2/
[02:08:17] <Cork> Trisox: ya, that just means the parts has to be added to the form
[02:08:20] <dwarder> why is that  when i use .hide my element shows at the bottom of a page
[02:08:24] <Cork> not very complex
[02:08:25] <Ankabout> Cork, thanks
[02:08:30] <dwarder> after hiding it
[02:08:40] <Ankabout> and what about getting it reset when I move out of the box?
[02:08:49] <Trisox> mm
[02:08:57] <Cork> ?.mouseout @ Ankabout
[02:09:02] <Cork> bah...
[02:09:10] <Ankabout> ah yeah damn
[02:09:15] <Ankabout> lol
[02:09:16] <Ankabout> thanks!
[02:09:18] <Cork> Ankabout: bind the mouseout event
[02:09:24] <dwarder> nevermind
[02:09:36] <Cork> Ankabout: or btw no use the mouseleave instead
[02:09:36] <Ankabout> bind?
[02:09:38] <Cork> its better
[02:09:40] <Ankabout> one sec phone meeting...
[02:09:49] <Cork> .mouseleave(function() {});
[02:30:55] <m8> Hi, what is the best jquery plugin for show a calc sheet like ms excel?
[02:35:34] <alaing> grr
[02:35:51] <m8> :E
[02:36:52] <alaing> on my page i'm loading two different versions of jquery ui. I'm using the datepicker widget and have it set to default to show on focus
[02:37:56] <alaing> but when i set focus it does not show the datepicker. I have inspected the DOM using FireQuery and it has all the  datepicker functions attached to the element so its setting it.
[02:40:35] <alaing> in IE 7 i'm getting an error saying $.datepickers is null or not an object
[02:40:46] <alaing> firefox is happy
[02:44:23] <aaronmcadam> 2 versions?
[02:44:27] <aaronmcadam> why the pain?
[02:45:31] <Cork> alaing: check for syntax errors in ie
[02:45:47] <Cork> i get things like that quite a lot from trailing commas
[02:45:50] <aaronmcadam> in ie#s source? :P
[02:45:59] <Cork> no its error dialog
[02:46:07] <aaronmcadam> I mean it's source code :P
[02:46:09] <alaing> Cork I dont think its that
[02:46:15] <aaronmcadam> jokes
[02:46:25] <Cork> aaronmcadam: i got that :)
[02:46:37] <alaing> I t works in of dev enviroment which only uses one version of jquery 1.4.2 and uery ui 1.8.1
[02:46:39] <Cork> but i had already sent the line :/
[02:46:47] <aaronmcadam> heh
[02:47:16] <Cork> alaing: your using multible version of jquery in the same page?
[02:47:38] <alaing> but in our train enviro (which loades in jquery 1.6.2 and jquery ui 1.8.14) as well as our 1.4.2 and 1.8.1
[02:47:46] <alaing> Cork: yes
[02:47:55] <Cork> ouch...
[02:48:18] <alaing> Cork ORACLE application express now includes jquery/ui
[02:48:23] <Cork> i'm not even sure you can load jquery ui with multible versions
[02:48:38] <alaing> our train enviroment is run by an external provider
[02:48:56] <alaing> Cork: I seems to work for the TABS
[02:49:07] <aaronmcadam> *seems to* oh noes
[02:49:21] <alaing> and when I run myJquery.datepicker.version it returns 1.8.1
[02:49:21] <Cork> ya, but what i mean is (i'm like 70% sure) is that jquery checkes if the object exists
[02:49:26] <Cork> and if it does, it doesn't load
[02:50:03] <alaing> *Seems * as in I've had not issues with the functions I've needed to use.
[02:50:03] <Cork> hmm, no thats wrong
[02:50:11] <Cork> it does extend and overwrite the old version
[02:50:44] <Cork> so it was the oposit of what i just said :)
[02:51:20] <Cork> ugg... no
[02:51:33] <Cork> alaing: what does $.ui.version show?
[02:52:00] <Cork> i suspect it shows the version of the lib you load first
[02:52:28] <Trisox> cork i think i'm going to do something like this
[02:52:29] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/ypnv5/
[02:52:33] <alaing> Cork when I've inspected the DOM using FireQuery the datePicker has been applied to my text field but it does not run on focus
[02:52:40] <Trisox> only stepping back doesntg work proper yet
[02:52:52] <alaing> Cork actually it says its undefined
[02:53:45] <alaing> That might be why IE7 is throwing the js error but firefox is failing gracefully
[02:54:08] <alaing> let me see if the apex version is loading in the datepicker
[02:55:06] <Cork> alaing: if $.ui.version is undefined, then jquery ui isn't loaded correctly
[02:55:09] <Cork> none of them
[02:55:27] <alaing> sorry i missed the .ui
[02:56:05] <Cork> Trisox: firstly use .delegate or live instead, then you don't have to bind multible handlers
[02:56:06] <Trisox> lol
[02:56:13] <Trisox> k
[02:56:26] <Cork> and click('change' ??
[02:56:36] <alaing> Cork: $.ui is undefined. I'm just looking through the file that apex loades in
[02:56:36] <Cork> you mean bind('change' ?
[02:56:59] <Trisox> yea
[02:57:43] <Cork> alaing: then you have a lib loading problem http://jsfiddle.net/mp3UZ/
[02:58:09] <Cork> $.ui is where everything jquery ui related is hosted
[02:58:21] <Trisox> if you flow path first time around it works if you change something on top its a mess
[02:59:10] <alaing> Cork: oh APEX have fiddled with the jquery/ui js and added $ to their object. brb just going to see if i can find the version now
[03:00:43] <alaing> Cork: apex.jQuery.ui.version returns 1.8.14 but apex.$.ui.version returns undefined
[03:01:25] <Cork> ugg...
[03:01:31] <alaing> I agree
[03:01:42] <Cork> Trisox: you need to select nextAll and hide all then show the one your after
[03:02:01] <Trisox> mm
[03:02:22] <alaing> could it be somewhere in the jquery that its referring to $ instead of jQuery and thats that is throwing the errror?
[03:04:40] <alaing> my page loades in apex's jquery/ui and then I loading in my jquery/ui and use myJquery = jQuery.noConflict()
[03:04:52] <alaing> Cork ^^
[03:05:04] <Cork> alaing: no jquery safe wrap everything agenst window.jQuery
[03:06:31] <alaing> I bet its Apex thats introduced this error with $.datepicker is undefined

[03:37:58] <AdvoWork> hi, im trying to construct an object full of my data, but for some reason, it just tells me its an object when I alert. Heres a few lines of the code: http://pastebin.com/f1kA44as  any ideas please?
[03:41:34] <Narhir> is that code correct folks?
[03:41:35] <Narhir> link.text(div.css('height','57px') ? "Close" : "Read More";
[03:42:21] <opurdei> Hey. I want to toggle an element between the stylesheet height and an explicit height 'auto'. Going to height 'auto' is easy, but to go back do I have to have stored the original height or is there a more elegant way?
[03:43:18] <opurdei> Narhir: Well youre certainly missing a closing ) ...
[03:46:12] <Narhir> well yeah...
[03:46:14] <Narhir> but beside that
[03:47:57] <AdvoWork> im doing var data = { firstname: $('#firstname').val(), surname: $('#surname').val(),}  but when I alert(data) it just shows: [object Object]  any ideas please?
[03:51:12] <opurdei> Narhir: Well, does css(key, val) not set the the value of the key? Looks like you want to test it, but are actually setting it.
[03:51:36] <opurdei> div.height() == 57 maybe?
[03:51:53] <opurdei> that that seems very fragile even of it dows work
[03:52:50] <opurdei> AdvoWork: data is an object. If you want to inspect it try console.log and look in Firebug or the safari/chrome inspector (IE9 probably shows it too)
[03:54:29] <Narhir> hm
[03:54:34] <Narhir> its trobulesome thingie to do
[03:55:42] <Narhir> I will create jsfiddle
[03:55:59] <AdvoWork> opurdei, ok thankypou
[03:57:49] <AdvoWork> why when a checkbox is not checked, if i send it through as managedby = $( "#managedby" )  it shows as "on" ?
[03:57:55] <RobertoBlanco> Hello - got a Question... I have a <div> with 8 div>img. On document.ready i want these 8 images fadeIn() randomly. Not each after each. Anybody here who might help me with that?
[03:58:54] <Narhir> okay.. anyone ahve any ideas how to make it work ?;/
[03:58:55] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/GM7rM/1/
[04:02:11] <Narhir> sorry for last link it should be jquery chosen: http://jsfiddle.net/GM7rM/3/
[04:05:20] <AdvoWork> whats up with allowedtounorderjobs = $( "#allowedtounorderjobs" ).attr('checked') ?  im passing this data to a php file
[04:07:24] <Spipmalion> hi
[04:07:33] <Narhir> hello
[04:08:00] <Spipmalion> i have an <ul> </ul> with only line breaks and spaces inside, how can i select it to hide it please ? :empty doesnt take it on chrome coz of the linebreaks
[04:13:26] <RobertoBlanco> Hello - got a Question... I have a <div> with 8 div>img. On document.ready i want these 8 images fadeIn() randomly. Not each after each. Anybody here who might help me with that?
[04:15:11] <Narhir> opurdei any ideas mate ?;/
[04:16:13] <rio{> fadeIn(Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min);
[04:17:13] <rio{> that however will start all fadeIns at the same time, but they will fadeIn different speed
[04:17:25] <rio{> other wise you will have to use timeout i guess
[04:18:25] <Narhir> rio any ideas to my problem ?
[04:18:42] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/GM7rM/3/
[04:19:53] <Jon47> RobertoBlanco, why not fade them in as they are loaded (bind to the ".load" event)
[04:20:28] <RobertoBlanco> you mean: fading in every image at the same time?
[04:21:28] <rio{> Narhir: What's not working as expected?
[04:22:18] <Narhir> this is my latest version: http://jsfiddle.net/GM7rM/15/
[04:22:43] <Narhir> basically.. at start you see 2 lines of text when you click on "read more" you should see "all line of text available" if you click on "close" then its trim back to 2 lines of text
[04:23:35] <Narhir> sorry this is the latest one: http://jsfiddle.net/GM7rM/16/
[04:30:49] <rio{> Narhir if you don't want to write a bigger custom slidetoggler, you will have to use a wrapper around the "extra text"
[04:30:58] <rio{> that you hide, and then slides down/up that
[04:32:37] <Narhir> hmm.. cant really do that
[04:32:43] <rio{> why not?
[04:32:48] <Narhir> cant I just change height of this div with overflow hidden ?
[04:33:03] <Narhir> because this "text" would be inputed by someone who doesnt know how to insert divs..
[04:33:13] <Narhir> and I doesnt want to use teasers for that
[04:33:20] <Narhir> I just want to do it by changing the height + overflow hidden
[04:33:41] <rio{> well the slideToggle is going to treat it as 100% slid down
[04:33:44] <Narhir> by default it would be 20px height + overflow:hidden + display:block on blick it will be 100% height ...
[04:33:50] <Narhir> hmm
[04:33:52] <Narhir> really ?
[04:34:11] <AdvoWork> whats up with allowedtounorderjobs = $( "#allowedtounorderjobs" ).attr('checked') ?  im passing this data to a php file
[04:34:13] <Narhir> perhaps Ishould use something else then slidetoggle
[04:34:14] <rio{> thats why it slides up the first time you press it
[04:34:29] <rio{> ye you could as a said write your custom solution
[04:35:04] <alaing> when using two different version of jquery ui on a page does the latest one take ownership?
[04:35:05] <Narhir> I really tough it was simpler
[04:35:24] <rio{> Its kinda simple
[04:35:43] <rio{> bind an event to click, that slideUp/slideDown depending on how the current element is
[04:36:20] <rio{> so that's basically a slideToggle, but with your own logic
[04:36:31] <Narhir> I see
[04:36:45] <Jon47> alaing jquery ui is a pretty big library, and it can be huge if you include all the features, i would think very hard about including two versions of it
[04:37:25] <fruitbat> alaing: if you load jquery or ui twice you will lose any other plugins loaded in between the first and second occurance as it overwrites the old one. That caught me out a while back
[04:37:53] <alaing> Jon47: it only matters on first load else the browser just uses the cached version
[04:38:35] <StPiere> does invoking .live('...', func()) multiple times on the same element coluld have negativ issues ?
[04:38:38] <alaing> fruitbat: even if you use noConflict?
[04:39:15] <Jon47> alaing why are you including two identical versions of the same code?
[04:39:55] <alaing> Jon47:  ORACLE apex has decided to include it in the page and we already using our own version
[04:40:01] <fruitbat> alaing: you should only ever have one version in a page, remove the seconf script include
[04:40:17] <alaing> Jon47: long winded story
[04:40:39] <Jon47> hehe, understood, and you're both including the same components?
[04:40:48] <alaing> fruitbat: I cant because of the CMS we using
[04:41:35] <Jon47> it sounds like your jquery-ui needs to be a superset of the CMS version, or else you may potentially break CMS features for which the components of the original jquery-ui are dependencies
[04:42:21] <Jon47> if both your version and the CMS version use the same components, just stop including your own version and use only the CMS version, right?
[04:42:23] <alaing> APEX is loaded jquery 1.6.2 / jquery 1.8.14 and we loading 1.4.2 and 1.8.1. Our dev/ live uses an APEX version which did not include jquery
[04:42:53] <fruitbat> souns like you should ask at APEX
[04:43:12] <alaing> our training enviroment supplied but an external supplier uses a more recent jquery version
[04:43:38] <alaing> sorry not jquery version i meant apex version which includes jquery
[04:43:43] <Sean-Der> Even though is technically just a Javascript question how can I set a num type, like MySQL float(6,2)?
[04:44:18] <alaing> Sean-Der: ask in #javascript
[04:44:20] <blackspotwiggins> Sean-Der, usual variables do not have type in js
[04:44:43] <lcof> http://jsfiddle.net/2YAxC/ -- "jQuery is undefined" -- Could someone help me with prototype conflicts? I have been fighting for hours now

[04:46:24] <alaing> lcof: try http://jsfiddle.net/2YAxC/1/
[04:51:14] <mark3> hey, i started to use jquery-mobile. how can i disable the ajax request in a list (i included http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b2/#/demos/1.0b2/docs/lists/docs-lists.html) but whenever i click on a link i go to index.html#/acura.html instead if acura.html
[04:51:32] <AdvoWork> whats up with allowedtounorderjobs = $( "#allowedtounorderjobs" ).attr('checked') ?  im passing this data to a php file
[04:52:10] <Narhir> thats treally strange that I cant set "height of hidding toggle to be fixed" :/
[04:53:11] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/ - how do I center the dropdown part of my dropdown menu (#main_menu > li > ul)? Because of the position: absolute, I tried setting left: 50% plus a jQuery calculated width and margin-left: -[width/2], but that didn't go so well: http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/10/
[04:53:24] <lcof> alaing, "$j is not defined"
[04:54:17] <lcof> no wait, syntax error
[04:56:12] <lcof> "c.call is not a function" -- prototype's call() being executed as jquery
[04:57:46] <wernerdev> What is better to do? Using the .live event? Or using the .bind even and unbind/rebind on every ajax request?
[04:58:22] <blackspotwiggins> wernerdev, .delegate is best, .live is also passable
[04:58:49] <wernerdev> blackspotwiggins: Oh didn't know about Delegate yet. Will look into that one...
[05:00:08] <wernerdev> blackspotwiggins: Is it me or is Delegate almost the same as Live at first sight?
[05:00:15] <blackspotwiggins> yeah it is similar
[05:00:22] <blackspotwiggins> it is more specific -> faster
[05:01:22] <wernerdev> blackspotwiggins: Ah ok thanks.
[05:02:41] <lcof> thanks alaing, http://jsfiddle.net/2YAxC/2/ did the trick

[05:09:03] <muzone> I'm trying to get the width of an UL, then set that width on it, plus a negative margin-left: [width/2]. Is this how I do it? var w = $("ul").width(); $("ul").width(w); $("ul").css(margin-left, -w/2);
[05:11:49] <[1]bob> Hi, why i'm gettin an $ is not defined error since i'm using it 2 lines above and it is working :s
[05:12:18] <cole_gillespie> maybe you have an error?
[05:13:32] <muzone> cole_gillespie: any chance you could help me out?
[05:13:47] <cole_gillespie> possibly
[05:13:51] <cole_gillespie> whats uo?

[05:13:54] <muzone> well
[05:13:58] <muzone> I'm trying to get the width of an UL, then set that width on it, plus a negative margin-left: [width/2]. Is this how I do it? var w = $("ul").width(); $("ul").width(w); $("ul").css(margin-left, -w/2);
[05:14:32] <cole_gillespie> why would you set the width = current width
[05:14:54] <muzone> true
[05:14:59] <vs> hi everybody, guys can I use "mm" units in width()/ height()/ offset()  functions somehow ?
[05:15:03] <muzone> probably should take that out
[05:15:10] <muzone> is the margin-left one alright though?
[05:15:20] <cole_gillespie> h/o i will make a jsFiddle to show you how to do it
[05:15:32] <muzone> wait hold up
[05:15:35] <Danny_Joris> Hi all - can anyone tell why flexslider http://flex.madebymufffin.com/ is different than other sliders. I'm not an expert, but isn't responsive design all about html and css?

[05:17:57] <Narhir> to make it work...
[05:18:38] <coldhead> sorry Cork, alaing :(
[05:18:41] <[1]bob> I have 2 html links, one has an id but not the other one , how can I test if the id is set with jQuery ?
[05:21:23] <cole_gillespie> muzone, http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/12/
[05:24:37] <muzone> cole_gillespie: wrong paste probably?
[05:24:48] <cole_gillespie> no
[05:25:01] <muzone> cole_gillespie: http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/11/ is the one where I got the centering JS
[05:25:10] <muzone> cole_gillespie: not sure if it's correct though
[05:25:38] <Rickardo1> is it possible to set a callback when an each iterator is finished?
[05:25:53] <cole_gillespie> Rickardo1,
[05:25:54] <cole_gillespie> yes
[05:26:00] <Rickardo1> cole_gillespie: how?
[05:26:05] <cole_gillespie> just do a simple check to see if you are at the end of your array or object
[05:26:26] <Rickardo1> cole_gillespie: is there any property to read?
[05:26:30] <cole_gillespie> if( i === myArr.length - 1 ){ you are at the end }
[05:27:14] <cole_gillespie> muzone, that looks fine to me
[05:27:27] <cole_gillespie> i do not know how well it will play in a larger dom tree though
[05:27:49] <cole_gillespie> there is probably a better way to do it
[05:27:55] <cole_gillespie> i dunno what you were doing with your css there
[05:27:58] <cole_gillespie> but it looks like it works
[05:28:02] <cole_gillespie> but it may be a bit of a hack
[05:28:56] <nail_> each is not async, there's no need for a callback
[05:29:02] <blackspotwiggins> Rickardo1, who not run something immediately after each
[05:29:07] <blackspotwiggins> why*
[05:29:33] <cole_gillespie> blackspotwiggins, that can be problematic
[05:29:41] <cole_gillespie> you can also use jquerys complete
[05:29:48] <blackspotwiggins> huh?
[05:30:26] <muzone> cole_gillespie: At http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/11/ - I managed centering my absolute-positioned dropdown using some JS - but why do the last columns break off?

[05:31:43] <g0rd0n> i have a problem with the jQueryUI Button on IE. basically the button becomes too big, has a black border and no round corners. but for some reason the jqueryui.com demo page works fine in IE. any idea what could be the cause?
[05:31:50] <blackspotwiggins> cole_gillespie, that's not really a question about each
[05:31:53] <g0rd0n> it works fine in mozilla/webkit
[05:31:59] <blackspotwiggins> more like animation callbacks

[05:33:57] <cole_gillespie> muzone, check your css
[05:34:54] <muzone> cole_gillespie: cool, glad it's not the css
[05:35:06] <muzone> cole_gillespie: offtopic - can you spot what's wrong with the css though?
[05:35:47] <cole_gillespie> muzone, no i am busy at the moment
[05:35:53] <muzone> np
[05:35:56] <muzone> thanks again man
[05:35:59] <cole_gillespie> muzone, probably some widths or something
[05:36:10] <cole_gillespie> muhdick, or padding / margin
[05:36:27] <cole_gillespie> muzone, you want it all to fit in you absolute box
[05:37:12] <dbugger> Hey guys. What is the equivalent in jquery from "request" in prototype?
[05:37:27] <SuperRoach> argh. What's a charecter I can use in a string to represent a new line? \n isn't working.
[05:37:41] <dbugger> SuperRoach, <br> for html
[05:40:59] <blackspotwiggins> dbugger, you mean ajax?
[05:41:34] <dbugger> yes, but it does something weird when applied on forms..
[05:42:48] <[1]bob> screw you $ is not defined >_<
[05:47:29] <adv_> i'm having a form.html with a form action=post to form_process.php. form_process.php does some calculations that take 10sec to complete. when i click the submit button, it doesn't transfer me to form_process.php until the calculations (external system call) are complete. i want to have a jquery ui blocking display 'please wait while we are processing your options', but i dont know where to put it
[05:47:46] <muzone> cole_gillespie: the CSS is ok

[06:13:02] <[1]bob> How can I check if an attribute exists s?
[06:13:56] <Jon47> [1]bob .. type your exact question into google, you'll find lots of good answers
[06:14:03] <[1]bob> I've tried $('#shopLink').length > 0 but doesn"t work
[06:14:43] <[1]bob> it is weird since alert $('#shopLink').length outputs 0 whereas $('#shopLink').length in firebug console returns 1
[06:14:47] <Jon47> .length property of the jquery object will tell you the number of matched elements in the set, if you're using it on an id selector, i hope the answer is 1
[06:14:54] <Jon47> or 0
[06:15:28] <matt_sa> what's the best way to query the value of a css style from a jquery object?
[06:15:34] <Cracker2> is there a way to hide an element but keep it's height?
[06:15:52] <Jon47> Cracker2 visibility:hidden (though it will still take up space in the layout)
[06:16:17] <Cracker2> does jquery hide() visibility:hidden or display:none?
[06:16:21] <Jon47> another idea is to set "height" to "auto" but "max-height" to "0px" although i can't promise that will work ..
[06:16:33] <Jon47> ?hide Cracker

[06:17:21] <Ankabout> does anyone know how I can make this loop through elements, and shuffle the contents of one into the next?
[06:17:21] <Ankabout> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[06:17:25] <Jon47> it shouldn't, when you hide an element it gets display:hidden
[06:17:27] <Jon47> er.. none
[06:17:29] <Cracker2> i'll try visibility:hidden
[06:17:31] <DarsVaeda> I have a function that sends a $.post and in the callback of that I return true on success - yet I get "undefined" if I log the return of the function...I guess that will only work if its a synchronous request?
[06:17:56] <Jon47> DarsVaeda exactly
[06:18:04] <DarsVaeda> or do I have to do something like...return 2;
[06:18:14] <DarsVaeda> return(2);  i mean
[06:18:36] <DarsVaeda> because the return is nested in another function
[06:18:37] <blackspotwiggins> ?ajax101 @ DarsVaeda
[06:18:37] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[06:18:50] <blackspotwiggins> you cant return from one function to another
[06:18:52] <Jon47> it will never work like that asynchronously, you need to put all your success code into the callback function, or mess with deferreds/promises
[06:19:10] <blackspotwiggins> when one of them is async
[06:19:19] <DarsVaeda> hmm hmm thought so
[06:23:25] <SandmanNet> So, jQuery can only tell me the width of an image if its width/height attributes are set?
[06:23:52] <adv_> i'm having a form.html with a form action=post to form_process.php. form_process.php does some calculations that take 10sec to complete. when i click the submit button, it doesn't transfer me to form_process.php until the calculations (external system call) are complete. i want to have a jquery ui blocking display 'please wait while we are processing your options', but i dont know where to put it. can anyone help?
[06:24:06] <Jon47> SandmanNet uh no, it can tell you the dimensions anytime
[06:24:21] <blackspotwiggins> Jon47, SandmanNet after it has been loaded
[06:24:29] <SandmanNet> Jon47: oh, ok, then I'm doing something wrong... I want to find out the width of the first IMG tag in #book
[06:24:41] <Jon47> sandmannet make a fiddle and we'll debug it for ya
[06:24:47] <SandmanNet> blackspotwiggins: Which may or may not occur after .ready() ?
[06:24:52] <blackspotwiggins> after
[06:25:00] <SandmanNet> Jon47: http://sandman.net/test/flipbook.php
[06:25:12] <SandmanNet> Ooops!
[06:25:13] <Jon47> sandmanet $(window).load will fire after all the images load
[06:25:16] <blackspotwiggins> SandmanNet, the img fires either load or error
[06:25:23] <blackspotwiggins> window.load fires when everything is loaded
[06:25:31] <blackspotwiggins> including images
[06:25:32] <Jon47> $(document).ready fires when the DOM is ready, but not necessarily before the resources are loaded
[06:25:46] <SandmanNet> Ok, so the code should be added to window.load ?
[06:26:01] <blackspotwiggins> SandmanNet, that depends on what you want to achieve
[06:26:31] <SandmanNet> blackspotwiggins: I want to determine the width of the first image inside the #book div... The img tag does not have width/height attributes
[06:26:59] <blackspotwiggins> bind to that images load in ready
[06:27:09] <SandmanNet> How?
[06:27:14] <blackspotwiggins> ?bind @ SandmanNet
[06:27:14] <bot-t> SandmanNet, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[06:27:36] <SandmanNet> $("#book img").bind("load", function(){ ....});   <- that?
[06:28:01] <blackspotwiggins> can you please spend 15 seconds thinking/trying it before you ask?
[06:28:42] <SandmanNet> All I have to go on is the strangely worded "bind to that images load in ready"
[06:28:52] <SandmanNet> Which hardly constitutes a parseable English sentence
[06:28:56] <SandmanNet> I'm doing my best here :)
[06:29:14] <[1]bob> $('a[name=myAttribute]').length returns 16 in firebug console but alert($('a[name=myAttribute]').length) output is 0 why ?
[06:29:26] <bartmax> i have $.each('bla') ... but i need it in live, should I use  $('selector').live('load', fn) ?
[06:31:39] <blackspotwiggins> bind a handler to the load event for <img> element you need inside the ready() callback. better?
[06:31:41] <Jon47> sandmannet what may seem strangely worded to you is actually a carefully constructed and precise statement intended to help you, written by a guy who has absolutely no incentive to help you at all
[06:32:37] <SandmanNet> blackspotwiggins: Maybe, I'll check some.
[06:32:52] * blackspotwiggins apologizes for ambiguity
[06:32:53] <SandmanNet> Jon47: Well, I disagree, but hey - we can't all think alike :)
[06:36:19] <SandmanNet> So yeah, my example was seemingly correct, in spite of me not using "15 seconds" to think... http://api.jquery.com/load-event  <- BUt it still won't give me the width of the image widt .width()
[06:36:44] <SandmanNet> I.e. I'm using $("#book img").load(function(){ console.log($(this).width()); });
[06:36:51] <SandmanNet> And I get 30 "0"
[06:37:06] <SandmanNet> Could it be because it is absolutely positioned?
[06:37:15] <SandmanNet> Sound weird, but I suppose it's possible.
[06:37:18] <SandmanNet> Oh wait
[06:37:28] <SandmanNet> Damn, this won't work for me.
[06:37:43] <SandmanNet> It would actually calculate displeyd width - not the width of the actual image file
[06:37:48] <SandmanNet> displayed
[06:38:09] <SandmanNet> Hmmmm
[06:38:32] <SandmanNet> Back to the drawing board.
[06:38:44] <blackspotwiggins> SandmanNet, is the displayed width different?
[06:39:25] <SandmanNet> blackspotwiggins: Well, yeah. The height is set to to 100% in CSS, but the surrounding DIV doesn't have a height, so the values are 0 naturally. But I need the actual width and height
[06:40:07] <SandmanNet> Hmmm....
[06:40:28] <SandmanNet> But still - my entire problem is to set the height of the #book div according to the width/height ratio of the images
[06:41:25] <dbugger> hey guys. Im trying to make a submit button load the result per AJAX but its not working. can someone please tell me what am I doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/w0h22H1J
[06:41:35] <blackspotwiggins> can you not use absolute positioning?
[06:41:41] <blackspotwiggins> the div would size automagically
[06:41:52] <bartmax> i have $.each('bla') ... but i need it in live, should I use  $('selector').live('load', fn) ?
[06:42:03] <SandmanNet> blackspotwiggins: Yes, but that led to my problem. But I did use hieght 100% then, I'll try it again.
[06:42:42] <blackspotwiggins> you can't just set height:100%
[06:42:46] <blackspotwiggins> it wont work
[06:42:47] <SandmanNet> Exactly.
[06:42:55] <SandmanNet> Well, it would had the DIV had a height to it.
[06:43:11] <SandmanNet> But now I can set the DIV height according to the IMG height
[06:43:39] <SandmanNet> I was sort of thinking backwards
[06:47:00] <dabear> hi
[06:47:21] <dabear> I have some text and an image. the text surrounds the image
[06:47:48] <dabear> however, i want some of the text to be written over white space on the image
[06:48:05] <dabear> does anyone know if that is possible, and how to do that?
[06:48:21] <solars> hey, if I have  dates = $("#affected_from, #affected_to").datepicker( - how can I check if they are empty? I don't understand how to use these objects
[06:49:40] <ruby_on_tails> i am using live("submit") on a form, it works in IE :O but not in chrome :O:O
[06:49:42] <ruby_on_tails> why ?
[06:49:44] <ruby_on_tails> WHY ?
[06:56:47] <Dreamstar> Hi there! I want to post some data with a php script then update div without updating the page. This is how I have done it so far https://pastee.org/v2ryw
[06:58:13] <bartmax> how to convert $('selector').each(FucntionName) to $('selector').live('???', FunctionName) ?
[07:01:51] <bartmax> what's the main event of new dom elements?
[07:05:23] <SandmanNet> wtf, why won't it work...
[07:08:01] <solars> dates = $("#affected_from, #affected_to").datepicker( how do I access the second datepicker here?
[07:08:03] <djQuery> bartmax: .live doesnt need anything where you have the ???
[07:08:18] <djQuery> maybe your thinking of .delegate
[07:08:44] <djQuery> dangit yes it does.
[07:09:13] <djQuery> bartmax: $('selector').live('click', functionname)
[07:09:26] <djQuery> where click is the event you want to bind to
[07:10:35] <djQuery> SandmanNet: have you looked in the console and see whats coming back?
[07:10:52] <djQuery> is it returning xml or html?
[07:11:03] <janthony> Any idea why $(this).parents(".insert-offer-to-post"); returns [ ] in console vs the dom object for that selector?
[07:11:36] <Brodingo> janthony it returns a jquery object
[07:11:49] <djQuery> janthony: try using .closest instead? see ?.closest
[07:11:49] <bot-t> janthony, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:11:58] <djQuery> ?.parents
[07:11:59] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[07:12:08] <muay-guy> hello guys, I have a questionm
[07:12:14] <djQuery> bot-t: wakeup
[07:12:15] <bot-t> djQuery, JQuerySprint/docs/irclog - All times are EDT(GMT-4) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/docs/irclog
[07:12:17] <Brodingo> if you want the dom node use .get(0) or [0]
[07:12:31] <muay-guy> I'm using the validate plugin for two forms (which are in the sam page) and I'm not sure how to use the equalTo here
[07:12:35] <muay-guy> I can't use an ID
[07:13:47] <muay-guy> because it's two forms, if I have an id there and I need the user to repeat the email then it's gonna compare the second email of the second form to the first email of the first form
[07:14:39] <djQuery> ?closest@janthony
[07:14:40] <bot-t> janthony, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:15:35] <muay-guy> need a link? I suck at explaining
[07:15:47] <janthony> Thanks!
[07:16:14] <djQuery> ?validate
[07:16:15] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation/validate - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[07:16:37] <muay-guy> djQuery: I got that, but it's explained with an id
[07:16:57] <muay-guy> and there's pretty much zero information about how to use the same for two forms
[07:16:59] <janthony> djQuery: Worked great. Thanks. For some reason I thought parents() did the same thing as I thought I have used it in the past.
[07:18:54] <djQuery> muay-guy: can you come up with a selector that returns just the field that its supposed to be =to?
[07:19:01] <djQuery> think it just uses a selector
[07:19:44] <muay-guy> djQuery: I don't know...http://www.sexitive.com.ar/nuevo/wp-content/themes/sexitive/js/valid-consultora.js  this is the code
[07:19:55] <muay-guy> I'm not sure if I could use a conditional there
[07:20:14] <muay-guy> and I'm not sure how could I ask jQuery to tell me the form id, maybe that could help me
[07:20:33] <alaing> if I load in two versions o jquery ui does the last version get used or the most recent?
[07:20:52] <muay-guy> something like if ($(this) == "idname") {}
[07:21:07] <djQuery> muay-guy: since both forms are on the same page do they both have ids or names that are unique?
[07:21:11] <Dreamstar> Hi there! I want to post some data with a php script then update div without updating the page. This is how I have done it so far https://pastee.org/v2ryw
[07:21:44] <muay-guy> djQuery: yes I gave them different ids
[07:22:07] <djQuery> alaing: have never loaded 2 at once but in theory the last one to load would overwrite the first
[07:22:51] <alaing> djQuery I thought that two but I'm not sure why the ui.datepickers is not working
[07:23:32] <alaing> the page is loading jquery 1.6.2 and ui 1.8.14 and then i'm loading jquery 1.4.2 and ui 1.8.1
[07:24:03] <alaing> I have inspected the dom using firequery and datepicker has been added to the input field
[07:24:18] <muay-guy> djQuery: "consultora-form" and "mayorista-form"
[07:24:30] <djQuery> muay-guy: I hate putting rules like this into place  localidad: "required",
[07:24:46] <alaing> so it is finding the element and applying it but when i set focus the datepicker is not displaying even when i set showOn to 'focus'
[07:24:53] <alaing> whcih si the default anyway
[07:25:19] <djQuery> seems so much nicer to write the element like <input name="localidad" required="required" type="text" />
[07:25:47] <muay-guy> djQuery: I know, I was just trying to follow the plugin rules
[07:25:53] <muay-guy> you can actually put required as a class too
[07:25:54] <djQuery> alaing: what the heck for?
[07:26:21] <djQuery> alaing: are u loading the css for ui?
[07:26:58] <alaing> I am
[07:27:27] <muay-guy> djQuery however I don't know what should I do in equalTo: ... should I write a function there with the conditional?
[07:27:46] <djQuery> muay-guy: by the way jquery 1.6 breaks this but with jquery 1.5 + validation plugin you could do <input type="email" required name="email" />   and it would validate it successfully
[07:28:14] <muay-guy> and how about the re_email?
[07:28:20] <muay-guy> the second email
[07:28:31] <djQuery> think the change in the attr or data in 1.6 breaks validate
[07:29:50] <muay-guy> I'm gonna try getting the id of this and using a conditional there, but I'm still not entirely sure how the final field id would appear there
[07:29:52] <adv_> if i include the same js script from page1 and page2, and it has code like $(document).ajaxStop($.unblockUI); , will it be able to function from both pages? like document becomes global?
[07:30:18] <djQuery> muay-guy: can you throw together a demo with 3 forms that we can play with?
[07:30:49] <muay-guy> djQuery: it's only two actually... http://www.sexitive.com.ar/se-una-consultora-sexitive/
[07:31:26] <djQuery> muay-guy: I ment somethign like jsbin or jsfiddle where I could actualy edit it
[07:34:29] <djQuery> muay-guy: seems like you have found a performance issue \ bug with validate when you do an equalTo it should only search the current form not the whole page.
[07:35:09] <djQuery> muay-guy: I would just suck it up and give both of the email fields distinct ids
[07:35:49] <muay-guy> djQuery: I'm tryuing to do that but I don't know how could I have a conditional in equalTo
[07:37:28] <djQuery> hmmm inside your form each statement you could grab the id of the form then you could make the equalTo: formId + '[name="Email]'
[07:37:40] <muay-guy> something likew this http://jsbin.com/efilak/edit#javascript,html but that would actually work
[07:37:40] <djQuery> muay-guy: ??? that work for you?
[07:38:26] <muay-guy> lets see with your advice..
[07:39:51] <zabka> hi, how can i get the top position from the browser window?
[07:41:09] <Brodingo> ?position
[07:41:09] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[07:41:20] <Brodingo> ?offset
[07:41:21] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:42:38] <dunderline> I'm trying to focus on a text field on an iPad, but it's not working.
[07:42:38] <bartmax> djQuery: i dont want to bind the 'click'
[07:42:43] <muay-guy> djQuery: nope I guess I'm gonna have to write validation for both of them
[07:43:07] <dunderline> My normal, timeouts don't seem to be working either.
[07:43:43] <Ank> why wouldn't this work in IE?  http://pastebin.com/mf0zA47D
[07:43:48] <djQuery> muay-guy: I htought you were looping over each form at some point?
[07:43:53] <Ank> I tried 8, 9 and compatibility modes
[07:44:11] <dunderline> Seems focus is blocked from onload, timeout, and ajax events.
[07:44:13] <muay-guy> djQuery: yeah, I am but that won't work if I have to compare an id
[07:44:29] <muay-guy> so, I really don't know what other solution I coujld use
[07:45:03] <alabd> Good day all , is there any way to makethese charts 3D  http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/download/demo2/
[07:46:17] <djQuery> muay-guy: http://jsbin.com/efilak/3/edit
[07:47:54] <djQuery> muay-guy: now without errors http://jsbin.com/efilak/4/edit
[07:48:22] <zabka> if the document is longer than screen i wanna only the top from the beginning of the part, that i can see
[07:48:41] <zabka> seems, neither position nor offset
[07:49:21] <muay-guy> djQuery: thanmks a lot man...so now equalTo selects according to the form id
[07:49:32] <djQuery> alabd: sure rewrite it
[07:49:52] <alabd> :D
[07:49:59] <Ankabout> why wouldn't this work in IE?  http://pastebin.com/mf0zA47D
[07:50:00] <alabd> easy way
[07:50:01] <Ankabout> I tried 8, 9 and compatibility modes
[07:50:23] <adv_> how can i get into the data field of jquery.post all of the text fields ? like in html form post all the names get sent. how can i send all those with jquery.post?
[07:50:24] <djQuery> anakron: see ?demo
[07:50:25] <bot-t> anakron, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:50:39] <djQuery> Ankabout: put together a demo and I will try it in mine
[07:51:01] <djQuery> adv_: see ?.serialize
[07:51:01] <bot-t> adv_, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:51:27] <djQuery> adv_: there is allso see ?.serializeArray
[07:51:28] <bot-t> adv_, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:51:59] <Ankabout> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rVTNv/22/
[07:52:17] <Ankabout> similar, not exactly the same
[07:52:28] <djQuery> adv_: and if your just lazy there is see ?ajaxForm
[07:52:29] <bot-t> adv_, ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[07:52:50] <adv_> but how can i read them ? i use php as $_POST['name'] in html forms
[07:53:32] <djQuery> adv_: that should do it but I am not that familar with php
[07:56:02] <djQuery> Ankabout: yeah in ie it dont do anything
[07:57:08] <Ankabout> djQuery, just noticed that another version of the code does: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rVTNv/23/
[07:57:11] <Ankabout> can you see why?
[07:58:00] <djQuery> Ankabout: hmmmm If I open the c onsole it works in ie9
[08:00:30] <Ankabout> djQuery ?
[08:02:56] <noob13> hey, for some reason addClass won't work on my div, and i feel like i've had this problem before. what could be a likely reason?
[08:04:07] <dbugger> first of all, console.log the $ selector, to be sure you are getting it right
[08:04:57] <Ankabout> djQuery, it's because of the console.log line
[08:05:04] <Ankabout> apparently, IE can't log it if it's not open
[08:05:07] <Ankabout> IE--
[08:05:09] <djQuery> Ankabout: the first one does work in ie9 without the concole.log
[08:05:36] <djQuery> yeah ie doesnt like console.log if the console is not open
[08:05:53] <zabka>  how can i get the size of visible part of the document?
[08:06:31] <noob13> hm, addClass doesn't seem to override css properties? is this so?
[08:06:32] <Ankabout> djQuery it's amazing how even IE9 is still far from compliant
[08:06:42] <Ankabout> I wonder who would CHOOSE to work on IE?
[08:06:50] <Ankabout> as in work for MS on IE
[08:09:41] <noob13> so i just added !important to some properties of the class and it's working
[08:09:47] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy javascript window size@zabka
[08:09:48] <bot-t> zabka, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+window+size
[08:10:37] <djQuery> Ankabout: for 10 years I did support for a call traking software that would only run in IE whata  pain.
[08:11:05] <djQuery> Ankabout: this year they were supposed to release a version that supported FF and Chrome and they failed miserably
[08:11:32] <Ankabout> lol
[08:12:24] <iszak> Ankabout, it's often the ActiveX part of things which makes IE an attractive option along side the fact that it comes with all windows
[08:12:31] <iszak> djQuery, where are you from?
[08:12:48] <Ankabout> iszak, not in EU anymore
[08:12:55] <Ankabout> pcs come with no browser pre-installed
[08:13:02] <iszak> I don't believe that.
[08:13:06] <Ankabout> you have to choose your browser now, and it gives like 4 options
[08:13:12] <iszak> It's still in there - just deactived/not shown
[08:13:17] <djQuery> Ankabout: when it came out in 99 it was the bomb doing stuff that no one else was doing in a browser. Thier major hold back now is that they are using DATASRC which is an IE only thing <INPUT TYPE=TEXTBOX DATASRC="#dsoComposers" DATAFLD="compsr_last">
[08:13:20] <Ankabout> hmm yeah that's probably true
[08:13:31] <iszak> it's like how I go to disable windows component in the control panel and disable IE and then I can re-enable it without downloadingi t?
[08:13:32] <zabka> hmm, but it seems, that windowsize is the size of the document, not only from the visible part
[08:14:25] <djQuery> that and getting rid of all thier vbscript code
[08:14:32] <Sora-> hiya
[08:14:36] <iszak> zabka, you are mistaken.
[08:14:53] <djQuery> iszak: Dallas
[08:15:00] <iszak> zabka, $(window).height()/width() is the window size.
[08:15:18] <djQuery> iszak: what are u familar with the product that I speak of?
[08:15:23] <iszak> No I'm not.
[08:15:31] <Andy-> hi guys I have $('#foo').animate(function() { height: myHeight, top: myHeight } ....
[08:15:37] <adv_> how do i redirect to some page?
[08:15:43] <Andy-> firbug is kicking off about label "top"
[08:15:47] <Andy-> should I be using something else?
[08:16:05] <djQuery> adv_: see ?101
[08:16:05] <bot-t> adv_, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:16:06] <Cork[home]> adv_: window.location = '<your url>';
[08:16:20] <ChampS_> is there a parameter for show() to add display: table; and not display: block; after the animation?
[08:16:51] <Cork[home]> ChampS_: run .hide instead of setting css display:none
[08:17:10] <Cork[home]> it .hide stores the old display value
[08:17:22] <Cork[home]> and .show reuses it if it exists
[08:18:47] <ChampS_> #div { display: none; }
[08:19:08] <ChampS_> now $('#div').show(1000);
[08:19:26] <ChampS_> <div id="div" style="display: block;"></div>
[08:19:32] <ChampS_> thats the result
[08:19:41] <ChampS_> i want a display: table;
[08:20:00] <Cork[home]> $(function() { $('#div').css('display', 'table').hide().show(1000); });
[08:20:43] <ChampS_> ololol
[08:20:47] <stoned> o/
[08:21:00] <ChampS_> so #div {display: table; display: none; } work, too?
[08:21:01] <djQuery> Cork[home]: ChampS_   wont .show(1000).css('display', 'table')   do the same thing?
[08:21:02] <stoned> Can jQ detect mouse scrolling
[08:21:07] <ChampS_> not the same
[08:21:12] <ChampS_> it looks like
[08:21:13] <ChampS_> mh
[08:21:16] <Cork[home]> ChampS_: no .hide is the key
[08:21:19] <ChampS_> it looks strange ^^
[08:21:46] <Cork[home]> ChampS_: when .hide is run it stors the old display value in an internal variable
[08:22:04] <Cork[home]> djQuery: no show is async
[08:22:12] <stoned> I have to implement a reading of Terms and Conditions for a clients product. The software download link button is right below the T&C box. The button should not be made available until user has scrolled to the end of the T&C box

[08:23:40] <stoned> cork[home], please advise, I'm sure I can figure it out
[08:23:44] <stoned> with your help
[08:23:45] <timing> I found some using google but I want to best one :-)
[08:24:10] <Cork[home]> stoned: .scroll(function() { if(this.scrollTop < this.scrollHeight -10) {} else {} });
[08:24:21] <stoned> ok
[08:24:37] <stoned> I was thinking of scroll and bind to a function
[08:24:42] <stoned> but that is so much simpler
[08:24:52] <stoned> I wonder why this didn't show up in the api docs for me
[08:25:17] <Cork[home]> scrollTop and scrollHeight is native dom variables
[08:25:19] <stoned> <- .
[08:25:24] <Cork[home]> its not added by jquery
[08:26:15] <stoned> ok
[08:30:31] <xid> best way to check if an input is null every time a key is pressed?
[08:30:34] <xid> in that field?
[08:31:09] <xid> should I use $('element').keyup()
[08:31:20] <djQuery> ?mouseScroll
[08:31:21] <bot-t> djQuery, .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[08:31:38] <janthony> Is there a way to use .live() to detect if an iframe has been added to the dom?
[08:32:08] <janthony> According to the .load() documentation it says: Note: The .live() and .delegate() methods cannot be used to detect the load event of an iframe. The load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn't set by Firefox, IE9 or Chrome, which is required to do event delegation. - Which would tell me no.
[08:34:39] <djQuery> janthony: .live doesnt detect if anything is added anywhere
[08:35:18] <taktoa> does anyone know how I can center text within a JQuery button that's been sized to 20x20 px?
[08:35:36] <taktoa> here's the example: http://opennotes1.dyndns.org:1234
[08:35:42] <janthony> I have a click live event setup, but it's not detecting an iframe in the dom that was added via javascript after the dom was loaded.
[08:35:45] <taktoa> the pagination buttons are the problem
[08:35:56] <ravenzz> howdy
[08:36:19] <wib> taktoa: set a padding on the element instead of width/height
[08:36:28] <ravenzz> taktoa remove the padding
[08:36:36] <taktoa> lol
[08:36:38] <ravenzz> yep wib's ^
[08:36:49] <taktoa> k, I'll try that
[08:38:33] <Guest65349> why does the number of calls (reported by firebug) skyrocket when i try to cache a bunch of table cell objects in an array?
[08:41:10] <taktoa> hrm... I can't seem to override the button's text-span properties
[08:41:29] <ChampS_> thanks for help table dont work really but inline-block works great !
[08:41:30] <syte> i'm currently using the jquery plugin. With my selection menus, I have to click somewhere before the error message goes away: it doesn't automatically refresh after I select an option
[08:41:42] <syte> i
[08:42:13] <ravenzz> the jequery plugin?
[08:42:16] <ravenzz> -e
[08:42:20] <ravenzz> the error message?
[08:42:59] <orolo> how do i append a dom element inside of a blank div? (not html because i'm doing a loop and it will replace everytime)
[08:43:33] <ravenzz> ?append @ orolo
[08:43:33] <bot-t> orolo, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[08:43:53] <janthony> Can jQuery traverse through an iFrame?
[08:44:03] <muzone> I'm trying to center my absolute-positioned dropdown (http://jsfiddle.net/HShGz/) by making it left: 50%, and giving it a width and a negative width/2 left margin - but so far it seems to be setting the wrong width: http://jsfiddle.net/gPGt3/ - anybody know why?
[08:44:12] <orolo> yeah! ( i thought append did after();) thanks.
[08:44:13] <jonee> if javascript can then your answer is yes janthony
[08:44:14] <Cork[home]> janthony: no but you can give it the iframe document to work on
[08:44:16] <janthony> I'm getting stopped at the iframeparent, and can't traverse to anything inside the iframe.
[08:44:59] <janthony> Cork[home]: Eh?
[08:45:11] <Cork[home]> $('selection inside the iframe', $('#iframe')[0].contentDocument)
[08:45:32] <djQuery> janthony: see ?sop
[08:45:32] <bot-t> janthony, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:45:34] <ravenzz> janthony in order to access
[08:45:37] <ravenzz> eh
[08:45:41] <ravenzz> ok..
[08:45:48] <ravenzz> read that ^
[08:46:02] <Cork[home]> djQuery: sop doesn't have to be the cause
[08:46:23] <djQuery> Cork[home]: no but its usualy the first thing to rule out
[08:46:23] <Cork[home]> you still can't traverse through an iframe as it dosn't have a direct desendent in the dom
[08:48:45] <xid> is there a way, using some type of multiple union selector, to refine a selector intended to select a single element object?
[08:48:48] <alabd> Good day all , is there any way to make these charts 3D  http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/download/demo2/
[08:48:59] <danzik171> Is there an equivalent .even() method for the :even selector?  Looking thru the API I don't see one and I don't see one on the object, but the comments in the docs hint at it
[08:49:32] <danzik171> xid: What are you trying to select?  Can you give an example?
[08:50:07] <erichynds> danzik171: no, but you can .filter(":even")
[08:51:02] <ravenzz> danzik171 http://code.google.com/apis/chart/
[08:53:15] <danzik171> ravenzz: Ok, but what are you trying to select?  Can you make a jsfiddle test case?
[08:53:30] <xid> danzik171: the input object has no unique id other than its value and onclick attributes, yet input[value="x"] does not seem to select it
[08:53:40] <janthony> Cork[home]: That solution worked great. Thanks!
[08:53:41] <xid> i cannot edit the HTML
[08:53:56] <ravenzz> oh i am so tired, just browse that, time ago I saw something similar
[08:55:00] <ravenzz> danzik171 sorry, my links was for alabd
[08:55:12] <ravenzz> alabd http://code.google.com/apis/chart/
[08:55:18] <Cryp71c> Is there any effective way to alter the history of a page to support ajax?
[08:55:51] <xid> oh... nm
[08:55:57] <xid> danzik171: i was doing something wrong, nm
[08:55:58] <wild_oscar> I was wondering if you could help me. on paper, I have an assessment gauge like http://technabob.com/blog/2009/02/03/pac-man-pain-chart/ (analogue, ie, minus the numbers) where the person draws a line on the gauge to define how pain he is in
[08:56:12] <wild_oscar> I was asked "can this be done on a web page?"
[08:56:25] <wild_oscar> I was wondering if you know of ways to do this
[08:57:18] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/yYwYv/4/
[08:57:28] <wild_oscar> something like a draw area + scale already drawn + way to calculate where in the scale (ie, distance) you click
[08:57:29] <Ankabout> why doesn't the:  $(this).addClass('changed');  work?
[08:57:34] <ravenzz> wild_oscar maybe with a slider http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[08:58:04] <wild_oscar> ravenzz: groovy, that might work
[08:58:24] <Illusioneer> Is anybody familiar with Tache?
[08:58:35] <ravenzz> so the user can move the handler around the desidered value
[09:00:50] <wild_oscar> ravenzz: you can retrieve the value of the slider, right?
[09:01:02] <ravenzz> sure
[09:01:18] <ravenzz> wild_oscar http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#steps
[09:01:22] <danzik171> Ankabout: console.log the variables in the if statement.  Your else will never be hit, at least in the test you provided.
[09:02:01] <Ankabout> danzik171I just noticed it does work, but the element doesn't get the style of the new class... so weird
[09:03:00] <ravenzz> wild_oscar take a look at the source: "View Source"
[09:04:03] <danzik171> Ankabout: Oh, probably because of CSS specificity.http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#value-stages
[09:05:38] <alabd> ravenzz: what's the link for
[09:06:37] <ravenzz> alabd google graph apis, you can build (3D) graphs with that
[09:07:19] <alabd> ravenzz:  cann't see the page si blocked for iran
[09:07:27] <ravenzz> lol
[09:07:34] <ravenzz> usa a proxy then
[09:07:43] <hilko> I've been reading up on jQuery and javascript like crazy these past days, but one of the problems I find is that it's mostly just code snippets. I still run into a problem where my code turns to spaghetti, maybe someone can point in the right direction...
[09:07:45] <alabd> don't want us them at all
[09:08:10] <ravenzz> so I/it can't help you
[09:08:11] <hilko> basically, I find that to make use of animations/ajax, it seems impossible to not get a callback-spaghetti
[09:08:37] <alabd> yes
[09:08:56] <hilko> ideally I'd abstract(?) my code into a bunch of functions, and then have a short, clear bit of code that describes how these functions are executed
[09:09:03] <alabd> is it the only jquery 3d chart choice ?
[09:09:20] <ravenzz> dunno... that isn't jquery
[09:09:21] <hilko> would anyone know of a good resource that specifically discusses how to go about this the best way?
[09:11:22] <wild_oscar> ravenzz: thank you, you've been most helpful :)
[09:12:55] <ravenzz> wild_oscar you're welcome ;)
[09:15:35] <djQuery> alabd: if you keep asking the same question and getting the same answers then maybe you need to ask the question different
[09:15:35] <wild_oscar> since we're discussing ideas and solutions, perhaps the community might also have insight on edit checks. the basic idea is: imagine a questionnaire. I'd like to have some edit checks with some rules (like "date of this answer has to be date of question before +/- 3 days", or "this field must be >20). similar to form validation, but instead of enforcing values, it just warns/sends message if it fails.
[09:16:16] <djQuery> alabd: maybe find an example of what you want and ask how to do that. but of course if find an example you should be able to figure it out fromt hat
[09:17:05] <wild_oscar> now, the questions come from the database, so ideally the edit checks for a page are not hard-coded in the page (different page loads will have different questions, hence different checks). is there any jquery plugin that could help me with it?
[09:17:22] <lduros> hello, I'm writing a jquery plugin, and would like to make it compliant with whatever code style is usually considered best practice for jQuery. Is this what I should be looking at for plugins: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines -- or is this mostly for jquery core?
[09:18:31] <Dirkos> how can i select all divs from a parent div except the first 2 ones?
[09:18:50] <alabd> djQuery: there are some example in word microsoft office
[09:19:46] <djQuery> alabd: ok relevant html\javascript examples
[09:21:06] <ravenzz> wild_oscar if those are "random" rules, i don't think so. the 1st solution i think about, is storing the md5 of the answer on the db, and the compare it with the user input
[09:21:22] <ravenzz> and then*
[09:23:08] <Dirkos> how can i select all divs from a parent div except the first 2 ones?
[09:23:24] <wild_oscar> ravenzz: they're not random. ie, I know that question 2 "age" will always have to be, say between 18 and 30; date2 will always have to be whatever was answered for date1 +- 3 days
[09:24:25] <timing> Dirkos: .not(':eq(0):eq(1)') ?
[09:24:41] <timing> Dirkos: untested :-)
[09:25:07] <timing> or maybe:
[09:25:13] <Dirkos> timing i found :gt(1)
[09:25:18] <Dirkos> but thnx anyway :)
[09:25:19] <timing> even better :-)
[09:25:20] <ravenzz> wild_oscar oh so you can do that by yourself
[09:25:42] <timing> I wonder if this works: $('#parentDiv').not(':first').not(':first')
[09:25:52] <ravenzz> handling the blur() or keyup() event
[09:25:59] <ravenzz> for each field
[09:26:53] <Dirkos> well i now have the collection of 4 divs and i want to add 1 div around them but how?
[09:26:54] <Dirkos> $('div.related-artist .row:gt(1)').wrap('<div class="hidden" />');
[09:27:01] <Dirkos> this will add a div around every single element
[09:27:04] <alabd> djQuery: http://www.amcharts.com/javascript/3d-stacked-column/
[09:33:07] <qvarkk> i can't set a image with position fixed in ie7.. How can i make the image's "top"-value be set to correct value as the users scroll
[09:35:38] <Oggu> Uploadify is working in all browsers except Firefox. It will fire the 'onSelectOnce' event but not the 'onOpen' event. Any ideas?
[09:36:03] <wesada> Hello all.
[09:37:00] <wesada> What's the most efficient way for me to send the html between <body></body> back to the server?
[09:37:22] <Eviltwin> wesada: document.body.innerHTML ?
[09:40:22] <wesada> Eviltwin: I'd like to send it back using an ajax request, but I'd also like to send some form inputs back at the same time. I've tried appending the contents of the page body (which is wrapped in a div)  to the form and submitting it via ajax but the body is butchered.
[09:41:23] <erichynds> why does the server need the html?
[09:42:04] <wesada> erichynds: Front-end editable, need to send it back to the DB on save.
[09:43:52] <Eviltwin> wesada: Try adding a hidden field in the form and putting it in the value
[09:46:51] <kborchers> wesada: my guess is you probably need to see ?mdn escape
[09:46:52] <bot-t> wesada, Namespaced Events - jQuery provides a system for namespacing bound events for easier triggering and removal. Namespaced events were added in jQuery 1.2. http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events
[09:46:57] <kborchers> wtf?

[10:02:00] <Link-> I have a selector (".buttons").click() < with a click event. I'm calling a webservice that will return a new set of elements which have the class button. However the newely added elements aren't binded to the click event. How can i do that?
[10:02:10] <janthony> Is there a way to copy code by binding it to an event with jquery/javascript? The closest I have found is you have to use a third party library such as ZeroClipboard.
[10:03:51] <kborchers> ?live @ Link-
[10:03:51] <bot-t> Link-, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:04:11] <Link-> kborchers: perfect!!! Thank you!
[10:21:32] <eveningsky> is there an easy way to convert a load event into a promise?
[10:28:50] <jedimind_> should if($el.is('select')) be working okay?
[10:29:05] <jedimind_> looking for a <select> obv
[10:31:42] <dabear> eveningsky: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009194/how-to-use-jquery-deferred-with-custom-events
[10:33:17] <endeson> Is there an example of converting form data into json to use it within a POST request?
[10:33:47] <amid_hasan> Does anyone know how to "login" a user using only front end json/js etc
[10:33:55] <manuel_> endeson: i have that, wait
[10:34:45] <dabear> amid_hasan: that depends on your infrastructure. generally you should let the server do the authentication part
[10:34:49] <djQuery> endeson: converti it from what?
[10:35:39] <manuel_> https://gist.github.com/1198341
[10:35:55] <manuel_> you can then do var json = $("form").getAllFormData();
[10:36:11] <manuel_> or var json = $("form").getFormData(["name", "email", "password"]);
[10:36:36] <amid_hasan> dabear: how do you store "session" after you post a request to a server script?
[10:36:42] <amid_hasan> using only js
[10:37:14] <dabear> manuel_: why not just do $("form").serialize() ?
[10:37:28] <manuel_> uh, cause i didn't know that one :)
[10:37:46] <dabear> amid_hasan: your question makes no sense without knowing why you need to do that
[10:37:52] <dabear> there is probably a better way
[10:38:26] <dabear> however, you can echo the session variable in php and combine it with json_encode()
[10:38:28] <manuel_> dabear: it doesn't return json, does it?
[10:38:37] <amid_hasan> dabear: i am restricted to using js/html. i need to "login" someone to associate their profile information with their login information.
[10:38:56] <amid_hasan> dabear: this is for a mobile application
[10:39:52] <dabear> you can act as a proxy, i.e. you can fetch and post to remote sites(using jsonp, or normal json if you use phonegap)
[10:40:08] <dabear> and you can manipulate any data you get back
[10:40:25] <amid_hasan> dabear: do you have resource i can reference for jsonp?
[10:40:34] <dabear> the $_SESSION contents is restricted to the server though.
[10:40:43] <manuel_> amid_hasan: session usually works through cookies, so you should be fine
[10:40:55] <manuel_> i login over json/REST from js, and it creates the session
[10:41:10] <dabear> however, if what you wanna do is persist a form login, then you can look at the cookie sent back in the response
[10:41:48] <dabear> e.g. you need to manually store cookies you get in return and send those cookies with the next request
[10:43:37] <Ankabout> how can I add (hover) this this function, in addition to mousemove() ?
[10:43:37] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/yYwYv/6/
[10:43:56] <Ankabout> basically, if the div appears while the mouse is over it, it doesn't change, only once you move the mouse
[10:44:30] <endeson> dabear: $('form').serialize returns url-encoded string instead of key/value pair or json
[10:46:15] <dabear> endeson: ok, .serializeArray then
[10:46:34] <dabear> but I see that might not be the format you want either
[10:51:30] <endeson> manuel_:  Thank you for this awsome piece of code :) saved me time
[10:53:10] <jpcody> hey all, line 13 here is throwing an odd IE error - https://gist.github.com/63ec7b29f75bd047c310 - the error is "Object doesn't support'getAttribute'" in jquery.min. have y'all run into this before?
[10:53:19] <jpcody> seems using .contents works fine
[10:53:28] <jpcody> but I'd love to understand more of what's up.

[11:07:10] <Naveen_> Ok thank you, I will try it out.
[11:08:20] <seutje> pouledodue: like an image? don't rly see how that's jquery related, but alright: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Standard_time_zones_of_the_world.png

[11:13:54] <mrwbsn> i see at my firebug the class name is turn into a.navbtnnext_1.. but when i clicked it is not work
[11:16:13] <xid> jQuery Validate doesn't seem to be able to validate form content inserted using append()
[11:16:54] <jedimind_> you have to modify when it's triggered, ie not on document.ready
[11:17:12] <jedimind_> but perhaps when you submit the form
[11:17:15] <xid> yeah i used submit()
[11:17:26] <jedimind_> i always hated the jquery validate plugin :\
[11:17:40] <jedimind_> it probably pulls a collection of all inputs on document.ready, and not when attempting to submit
[11:19:44] <djQuery> I got disconnected who was working on a multistep form? http://jsbin.com/oyoboc/2/edit
[11:20:10] <djQuery> that was the most basic example I could come up with
[11:20:19] <Oggu> Uploadify is working in all browsers except Firefox. It will fire the 'onSelectOnce' event but not the 'onOpen' event. Any ideas?
[11:20:19] <jedimind_> i just did a multi step jquery mobile form with custom validation and server-side callbacks for each step it wa sfun

[11:20:49] <drd> what's the canonical way to filter checked checkboxes from a wrapped set of checkboxes?
[11:21:06] <drd> ideally i'd like to do checkboxes.find(':checked') but that doesn't work..
[11:21:22] <erichynds> drd: filter(":checked")
[11:21:23] <jedimind_> checkboxes.is(':checked')
[11:21:26] <mrwbsn> yeah me
[11:21:46] <jedimind_> assuming you're itterating
[11:21:48] <drd> erichynds: awesome!

[11:22:18] <enjoycrf> is there a way to get the function name inside that function
[11:22:26] <mrwbsn> djQuery: yeaj its me :)
[11:24:20] <mrwbsn> djQuery: thx i'll try it
[11:25:25] <djQuery> mrwbsn: went ahead and put an answer on your stackoverflow
[11:26:57] <endeson> I'm using JSON.stringify and I get following array: "{\"id\":\"\",\"version\"... with escaped quotes - this isn't intended to happen right?

[11:31:58] <djQuery> mrwbsn: so that do it for you?
[11:32:25] <IanWizard> Hi all :)
[11:32:49] <mrwbsn> djQuery: still learning how to implement ur codes with mine
[11:34:24] <IanWizard> I'm trying to use an iFrame to render html entered into a text area.  I'm using $('#iframeID').html(contentString);   but it's not working.  I know that I seen an iFrame accessed this way before.  Does anybody have any suggestions?
[11:34:34] <djQuery> mrwbsn: the key is the .closest  you were using divs to put ur stuff in. where as mine was using fieldsets
[11:35:00] <djQuery> so if your containing divs just had a class applied to them that was the same for all steps
[11:35:27] <djQuery> you could do .closest('.containDivClass')
[11:36:42] <djQuery> mrwbsn: also for the .next and .prev it assumes that there wont be anything between the containing divs if there are you may need to do .next('.containDivClass') and .prev('.containDivClass') instead
[11:40:36] <mrwbsn> djQuery: what is mean of .closest() i still dont get it
[11:41:45] <zilly> Is there any reason why $(foo).change() will not trigger the change event for foo?
[11:42:04] <devinrolsen> mrwbsn, i grabs the closest element from your selector.
[11:42:13] <devinrolsen> I think it only looks for closest siblings though.
[11:42:16] <devinrolsen> I could be wrong.
[11:48:21] <IanWizard> I need a way to parse CSS in a textarea, and change the values of certain nodes.  For example,  say my css is   #box { width: 400px; height: 500px; }   I want to be able to change the value for height (within #box), to 400px  without having to write my own parser
[11:48:31] <IanWizard> Something like jquery, but for css (as text) would be nice.
[11:49:05] <IanWizard> I looked at jQuery.Rule, but I don't think that it's what I need.  The great lack of documentation didn't help.
[11:53:15] <djQuery> mrwbsn: .closest searches up the doc heirarchy till it finds something that matches the selector
[11:54:52] <djQuery> mrwbsn: so since the button is inside of a field set clickking on the button $(this).closest('fieldset')  finds the fieldset that the button is wrapped in
[11:55:03] <Jon47> I've used jQuery.Rule, it's pretty nice
[11:56:00] <djQuery> mrwbsn: you could probably use .parent('fieldset') as well
[11:56:08] <djQuery> mrwbsn: see ?.closest
[11:56:08] <bot-t> mrwbsn, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:56:20] <djQuery> mrwbsn: see ?.parent
[11:56:21] <bot-t> mrwbsn, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[11:56:47] <mrwbsn> djQuery : how about the button not inside of fieldset/divclass?! i have 2 button here.. one in divclass, the other ouside the divclass but it has same function?
[11:57:13] <enjoycrf> $('form').serialize();
[11:57:14] <mrwbsn> same function as the button inside divclass
[11:57:20] <djQuery> huh? in my example all are inside a fieldset
[11:57:21] <enjoycrf> anyway to have that an object
[11:57:54] <djQuery> mrwbsn: link to example or overflow ? again
[11:58:33] <mrwbsn> djQuery: just my idea
[11:58:52] <enjoycrf>  $('form').serialize(); anyway to have that come back as object
[11:59:28] <djQuery> mrwbsn: well if you know that the fieldset\div is before the button you could always do .prev instead of .closest
[11:59:54] <mg983> This has to be something basic... http://jsfiddle.net/BtEhv/ if you run it as it is, click OK the "bottomContents" div gets populated as I want it to. However if you remove the alertbox nothing gets populated! What am I doing wrong??  Thanks.
[12:01:43] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ mg983
[12:01:43] <bot-t> mg983, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[12:02:45] <mrwbsn> djQuery: owh okay.. so the easiest way is put the buttons inside the fieldset/div.. thx for ur advice.. :) i will try ur code this morning.. :P
[12:04:12] <Pymous> Hello ! :3
[12:04:28] <mg983> kborchers: hmm... that doesn't quite help me
[12:05:15] <Pymous> Someone can help me about a small issue ?
[12:05:22] <Pymous> Why this is not working ? http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/51/
[12:05:23] <kborchers> mg983: your return videoBoxes; will always be undefined because it does not wait for getJSON to finish. it returns immediately
[12:05:25] <Pymous> Can't figure it out :(
[12:05:45] <mg983> That much I get... how to get it wait is what I am unsure of.
[12:07:53] <kborchers> mg983: you don't get it to wait ... you just do your setting of the html inside the success so it doesn't happen until then http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/BtEhv/1/
[12:07:59] <Pymous> Okay, find out ! Wrong function, it's not next(), it's find()
[12:08:04] <Pymous> But I still have another issue !
[12:08:13] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/53/
[12:08:27] <Pymous> If you try this code, it's work, but if you empty the textarea, and retry
[12:08:32] <Pymous> the button isn't working anymore ! :(
[12:09:25] <Pymous> Someone know why ?
[12:09:29] <mg983> Thx
[12:13:25] <janthony> Does anyone know a native way to do a copy to clipboard function via javascript/jquery that is compatible in all modern browsers w/o using something like zeroclipboard (flash).
[12:14:46] <djQuery> Pymous: so its not appending nothing correctly?
[12:15:03] <djQuery> and why are u using parents?
[12:15:24] <Pymous> djQuery > Sorry for my language, i'm French, but I try to appen the val of the button inside the next textarea
[12:15:36] <Pymous> But when I empty textarea, I can't add the content after
[12:15:44] <djQuery> oh ok I get it now
[12:16:37] <djQuery> Pymous: thats funny if the textarea starts off blank it works fine
[12:16:50] <Pymous> Yep, that's where I totally blackout in fury :P
[12:17:05] <Pymous> I don't know why it's doing this
[12:18:09] <snover> janthony: it is both impossible and user-hostile
[12:18:44] <error> I have an image gallery that when an image is clicked on, i add a selected class to it. How would i limit it to where only one image could have that selected class?
[12:18:47] <janthony> snover: Yeah, tell that to my client. :P
[12:18:50] <sphinxxx> if i have "data" returned from an $.ajax call
[12:18:55] <djQuery> Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/CQKPu/54/  try this instead
[12:19:11] <sphinxxx> how do I find an element (by id) within the data variable (the response)
[12:19:20] <snover> janthony: thats your job, not my job. if you cant do that, get a different client/career :)
[12:19:55] <janthony> Why is it user hostile if it the link says "Copy Code"?
[12:20:15] <djQuery> error:   .click(function(){  $(this).siblings().removeClass('selected').end().addClass('selected');  })
[12:21:01] <djQuery> sphinxxx: what is data json or xml or html?
[12:21:11] <Pymous> djQuery > I will try, thanks you :)
[12:21:13] <danzik171> janthony: You might not be hostile.  Some random site that has access to get/put to your clipboard and wants to let you know that you've "won a free ipod" might be considered hostile.
[12:21:33] <janthony> danzik171: It's within a logged in area of WordPress.
[12:21:52] <djQuery> danzik171: can I trade in the ipod for an android?
[12:22:18] <danzik171> djQuery: Yes, but you'll need to send a 50$ check to our processing agency in Nigeria
[12:22:40] <hariom> I have a page that has 6 links that opens a dynamically created dialog box. When I click on the link, I see that there are 6 dialog open (overlapped, as I need to click 6 times on 'Close' button to close the dialog box). How to make sure that only one dialog box opens up
[12:23:41] <hariom> Clicking on any one of the 6 links should open the same single instance of the dialog box
[12:27:12] <Pymous> djQuery > I'm starting to go berserk.. your code is working on JSFiddle, but not in my own code (still the same issue, textarea empty after load = no bbcode added)
[12:27:19] <hariom> Anybody?
[12:27:28] <hariom> I have a page that has 6 links that opens a dynamically created dialog box. When I click on the link, I see that there are 6 dialog open (overlapped, as I need to click 6 times on 'Close' button to close the dialog box). How to make sure that only one dialog box opens up
[12:27:45] <eveningsky|2> hariom: don't create the dialog inside the click function
[12:28:15] <eveningsky|2> hariom: create the dialog first, then onclick just show it and edit.
[12:28:17] <error> djQuery: that code seems to apply the appropriate class but not remove it from its siblings
[12:28:26] <djQuery> Pymous: lol sorry man I suggest getting one of those rubber wrist rest things for your desk. It hurts a lot less when you bang your head on the desk that way
[12:29:04] <hariom> eveningsky|2, inside click function, I am just calling dialog('open')
[12:29:27] <hariom> On document ready, I create a dialogbox and use that reference in click function to open up
[12:31:00] <thefalling> If i add html to a page dynamically is there an easy way to retain that html through postback?
[12:32:48] <error> djQuery: i got it to work but since my images are in a table how can i limit it by the table rather than the table row, parent() doesn't seem to work.
[12:33:37] <devinrolsen> thefalling, you could setup a global var prior to the "adding html callback", then inside the "adding html callback", assign the desired retained markup to this global var?
[12:33:42] <devinrolsen> untested of course.
[12:34:52] <djQuery> error: http://jsbin.com/ivegok/edit#javascript,html,live
[12:35:02] <Pymous> djQuery > I think it's when I select the textarea, if I try to output the value of the textarea at every click, then, empty the textarea, the output follow the value as normal (without taking my action in count ! )
[12:35:41] <djQuery> error: hmmmm u like to be a pain in the ass dont you
[12:35:49] <error> sorry :-(
[12:35:55] <Pymous> Why ? ^^
[12:36:33] <djQuery> error:    $(this).closest('table').find('image').removeClass('selected').end().end().addClass('selected');
[12:37:24] <djQuery> error: well that should get you started anyway
[12:37:25] <hariom> eveningsky|2: you were right. It is working now. Thanks
[12:37:49] <djQuery> damn I hate tables
[12:38:25] <eveningsky|2> hariom. I dont' really use UI, but I just tested the one on the demos page and it seems to do the way you want. $('#dialog').dialog('open') twice then click close button once to close.
[12:38:33] <djQuery> error: see ?.closest
[12:38:34] <bot-t> error, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:39:00] <sphinxxx> djQuery sry i was away for a bit, the data is html
[12:39:47] <eveningsky|2> hariom: so probably just a typo somewhere in your code causing weirdness
[12:40:06] <error> oh yay i..errr djQuery got it to work ;-D
[12:40:07] <djQuery> sphinxxx: if you just want to limit it to 1 item you can use .load('url  #idofcontainer', function(){});
[12:40:23] <error> thanks man
[12:40:55] <djQuery> error: still dont like it because it doesnt allow you to toggle it if they click on one that is allready selected
[12:42:12] <error> perhaps i could use toggleClass?
[12:42:58] <djQuery> error: its messy but allows toggling    $(this).addClass('current').toggleClass('selected').closest('table').find('.image').not('.current').removeClass('selected'); $(this).removeClass('current');
[12:44:02] <djQuery> error: make sense?
[12:44:45] <djQuery> sphinxxx: think you would need to do $(data).find('#someid')
[12:45:06] <djQuery> not sure though how it will work with the html at that point
[12:45:16] <error> one sec looking over it
[12:46:03] <djQuery> ?.not
[12:46:03] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:50:21] <error> seems to work djquery i will do some more reading up on the closest selector
[12:50:26] <error> thanks for the help man
[12:50:40] <sylphid> :window 3
[12:54:26] <Articate> so, doing .show("slow"); ends up with the element having style="display:block" - any way to change that to style="display:inline-block"?
[12:55:14] <djQuery> error: I got it a little easier for you    $(this).toggleClass('selected').closest('table').find('.image').not(this).removeClass('selected');

[12:58:12] <{-_-\\\> $.get() doesn't work in MSIE if url contains non-ascii characters
[12:58:16] <{-_-\\\> works fine in other browsers
[12:58:18] <{-_-\\\> how can i fix it?
[12:58:39] <djQuery> Articate: .hide stores what it was before it was hidden and .show pulls from that stored value
[12:58:52] <snover> dont use urls with non-ascii characters in them

[13:02:59] <FuzzyNuts> Hi, does anyone know if and how I can get $_SESSION data in jQuery?
[13:03:42] <razzi> lol
[13:03:50] <razzi> FuzzyNuts i hope not..
[13:04:20] <FuzzyNuts> razzi: Why?
[13:04:43] <Articate> Because PHP is never to reach the user
[13:05:40] <FuzzyNuts> I mean so I can get the username stored in the session into a jQuery script
[13:05:45] <razzi> FuzzyNuts sites usually use session to keep track of login state
[13:06:05] <Articate> why do you need it in the jQuery script
[13:06:07] <Articate> ?
[13:06:12] <FuzzyNuts> A shoutbox
[13:06:15] <tiffoknee> hullo
[13:06:30] <{-_-\\\> hi, any internet explorer experts here?
[13:06:46] <FuzzyNuts> I hope it's a compatibility question
[13:07:20] <Articate> but, are you hoping jQuery can help others see what's posted in the shout-box?
[13:07:57] <FuzzyNuts> Articate: I gets the username from POST data in the jQuery, but I want it to get the SESSION data
[13:12:07] <toastyghost> {-_-\\\: what do you need to know?
[13:12:43] <{-_-\\\> toastyghost: $.get('//',function(ret){ alert('asd'); });
[13:12:47] <{-_-\\\> will work everywhere except ie
[13:13:36] <FuzzyNuts> Go cry to microsuck, they don't make gud browser
[13:13:40] <FuzzyNuts> :P
[13:13:46] <FuzzyNuts> Well, complain#
[13:13:50] <{-_-\\\> they banned me ~10 times for such actions
[13:13:57] <FuzzyNuts> Srsly?
[13:14:02] <{-_-\\\> they say that ie is w3c-compatible
[13:14:09] <{-_-\\\> and then ban
[13:14:14] <FuzzyNuts> It obviously isn't then
[13:14:22] <FuzzyNuts> They must me M$ fanboys
[13:14:32] <toastyghost> hm
[13:14:44] <toastyghost> looks like ie doesn't have greatest cyrillic support
[13:15:04] <FuzzyNuts> If it wasn't for the some 45% of people playing Microsoft's Monopoly, I wouldn't bother making IE supported
[13:15:17] <FuzzyNuts> And blast to hell with IE7/6 support
[13:16:07] <toastyghost> i'm googling around a bit and it seems in some circumstances, changing the encoding to utf-8 then back to cyrillic can make it work in ie
[13:17:07] <{-_-\\\> toastyghost: UTF-8 is not cyrillic
[13:17:10] <djQuery> toastyghost: when they said it was compliant they were talking about I.E 13
[13:17:17] <{-_-\\\> it's an international standart for decades
[13:17:40] <matt_sa> is there a method on jquery Objects to detect whether they're shown or hidden?
[13:17:44] <matt_sa> a boolean even
[13:17:54] <Jon47> matt_sa .is(':visible')
[13:17:55] <matt_sa> or do I have to query the "display" css attribute?
[13:17:59] <matt_sa> Jon47: thanks!!
[13:18:05] <Jon47> but read the docs on :visible, it may not be exactly what you think it means
[13:18:17] <Jon47> visibility:hidden, for example, is visible
[13:19:49] <{-_-\\\> fucking hell
[13:19:58] <{-_-\\\> i made a test script that returns QUERY_STRING of ajax request
[13:20:06] <{-_-\\\> and tried $.get with russian links
[13:20:17] <{-_-\\\> all browsers received encoded utf-8 url on response
[13:20:23] <{-_-\\\> ie received just test.php?=
[13:20:31] <{-_-\\\> all russian characters are wiped out on sending
[13:20:33] <{-_-\\\> FUCK IT lol
[13:21:27] <FuzzyNuts> {-_-\\\: In soviet russia, cyrillic doesn't program microsoft
[13:21:34] <FuzzyNuts> *implement
[13:23:18] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to persuade enough people to sign petition for banning internet explorer?
[13:23:27] <razzi> yes please
[13:23:29] <{-_-\\\> EVERY ITS VERSION IS BUGGY
[13:23:37] <razzi> at least up to version 8
[13:23:38] <{-_-\\\> damn, i hoped msie7 will be good
[13:23:40] <{-_-\\\> then - msie8
[13:23:43] <djQuery> {-_-\\\: noooooo http//saveie6.com
[13:23:43] <FuzzyNuts> I hope we can
[13:23:48] <{-_-\\\> now i just hope microsoft will die and create no more browsers
[13:24:11] <FuzzyNuts> Then Linux will be able to get exe/directX support? :D
[13:24:20] <{-_-\\\> for example i can't use fancy links now because IE DOESN'T SUPPORT IT
[13:24:40] <{-_-\\\> ie also DOESN'T SUPPORT IMG INSIDE LABEL
[13:24:42] <{-_-\\\> div inside label
[13:25:00] <{-_-\\\> i have to use jquery to add click() events for all subelements JUST FOR IE
[13:25:02] <FuzzyNuts> IE is the support graveyard
[13:25:23] <{-_-\\\> i spend 80% of my programming time fixing IE bugs
[13:25:40] <FuzzyNuts> http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[13:25:49] <FuzzyNuts> First good thing M$ have done in a while
[13:26:30] <{-_-\\\> so?
[13:26:31] <Lampoon> so are you
[13:26:37] <{-_-\\\> they release shit after shit, shit after shit, ...
[13:26:44] <{-_-\\\> it will never end
[13:27:03] <FuzzyNuts> Ikr
[13:27:05] <{-_-\\\> why can't they just accept that google chrome is 1000000000000000000000000000000000 times better than their crap and bury it
[13:27:10] <FuzzyNuts> Yep
[13:27:11] <{-_-\\\> and firefox, and opera, and safari
[13:27:15] <FuzzyNuts> Yeh
[13:27:24] <bbrandon> can my jquery.ajax sucess function return the div object?
[13:27:27] <{-_-\\\> ok i'm not gonna removing fancy links
[13:27:30] <{-_-\\\> i will just add ie check
[13:27:38] <{-_-\\\> with alert 'IE FUCKING SUCKS, NO AJAX FOR YOU'
[13:27:45] <devinrolsen> Honestly, I'm a little tired of the IE arguments. AND FLOODING!
[13:27:55] <erichynds> IE supports ajax
[13:28:03] <FuzzyNuts> I have a preference for chrome, but I don't bias my opinion over firefox, but I just generally dislike Opera
[13:28:06] <{-_-\\\> erichynds: it doesn't support non-ascii urls in it
[13:28:23] <{-_-\\\> like //
[13:28:29] <djQuery> {-_-\\\: funny this works in ie 9 http://jsbin.com/uneqod/2/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:28:31] <{-_-\\\> ie will just send //
[13:28:50] <devinrolsen> cause M$ hates russia.
[13:29:10] <{-_-\\\> devinrolsen: any other language won't work too
[13:29:12] <{-_-\\\> only ascii
[13:29:17] <erichynds> correct, you have to UTF8 it in IE
[13:29:25] <{-_-\\\> maybe they haven't heard about UTF-8 links yet
[13:29:26] <{-_-\\\> dunno
[13:29:32] <{-_-\\\> erichynds: how?
[13:29:41] <erichynds> UTF-8 is assumed, you are responsible for encoding it
[13:29:50] <{-_-\\\> how?
[13:30:06] <{-_-\\\> browser is responsible for encoding links btw
[13:30:16] <tiffoknee> I am having some trouble with a change()
[13:30:23] <{-_-\\\> your argument was like "http is assumed, you are responsible for encoding it"
[13:30:27] <erichynds> then why do api's like encodeURI/encodeURIComponent exist
[13:30:36] <{-_-\\\> erichynds: they don't work
[13:30:42] <erichynds> k
[13:30:48] <{-_-\\\> $.get(encodeURI(url),...)... fails
[13:31:07] <tiffoknee> I've pasted the relevant-ish code in a fiddle  but it's not functional because the whole thing is a bit huge http://jsfiddle.net/XFMXm/1/
[13:31:31] <tiffoknee> the problem is that the change works fine in page (if selected value is yes then show the second paragraph)
[13:31:50] <tiffoknee> but although I added a .change(), which does run on load, it picks up NO as the value..
[13:31:51] <tiffoknee> :S
[13:32:18] <tiffoknee> oh. hang on. I think I have had a brain fart..

[13:34:49] <{-_-\\\> encodeURI helped
[13:35:04] <devinrolsen> helped? or worked?
[13:35:07] <stoned> hey
[13:35:13] <stoned> why is your nickname so weird looing
[13:35:17] <{-_-\\\> devinrolsen: worked

[13:35:21] <{-_-\\\> stoned: it's a face
[13:35:26] <stoned> your face sucks!
[13:35:28] <stoned> get a new one
[13:35:34] <devinrolsen> so your orignal statement of "$.get(encodeURI(url),...)... fails" was not true all alone?
[13:35:35] <stoned> ohhhh burn!

[13:37:15] <stoned> I make do.
[13:37:20] <devinrolsen> well I'm just comparing all the negative you said (miles worth), when in fact it was working this whole time.. you need to slow your role man before mouthing off about how everything never works.
[13:37:24] <devinrolsen> here and the CSS room.
[13:37:33] <stoned> roll
[13:37:35] <stoned> not role.
[13:37:37] <stoned> :)
[13:37:44] <devinrolsen> that too
[13:38:01] <stoned> yay i corrected something that i knew was correct! i need a cookie.
[13:38:51] <devinrolsen> no, stoned, role is what I meant. "The function assumed or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation. "
[13:38:59] <snover> roll your role right into a hole you mole.
[13:39:05] <Pathos> http://pastie.org/2493626
[13:39:09] <Articate> looking into it, I can't get either .css('display', 'inline-block').hide().show('slow') to have it end up being display:inline-block and not block
[13:39:16] <Pathos> Could you possibly advise how this can be written any better
[13:39:19] <devinrolsen> sup snover
[13:39:21] <devinrolsen> long time no see.
[13:39:32] <snover> oh Im here. watching. WATCHING.
[13:39:38] <devinrolsen> creepy.
[13:39:42] <devinrolsen> yet comforting.
[13:39:44] <Pathos> this is really my noob code for a project
[13:39:51] <tiffoknee> does anyone know why this works: $(".isActive #p_45").removeClass but this does not: $(".isActive select").change(..
[13:39:53] <Pathos> please review it and advise if it can be written better
[13:40:35] <tiffoknee> this does: $("select").change(..   but targets the wrong stuff
[13:40:53] <Pathos> https://www.facebook.com/pages/SkyTestPage/197977350223305?sk=app_277648678928624
[13:40:57] <tiffoknee> I go mad
[13:40:57] <Pathos> viewable here
[13:41:13] <Pathos> everything works ok, I just wonder if I can do better.
[13:41:24] <Pathos> I do mostly serverside, not js.
[13:41:46] <Pathos> in fact, my employer recently asked if i can do node.js stuff, so I'm trying to learn js, but i am using jquery for this particular project
[13:42:11] <Pathos> i would ask in javascript chan, but the code here is written in jq
[13:42:40] <Ankabout> kborchers, ping?
[13:43:29] <kborchers> Ankabout: yo
[13:43:41] <Articate> could anyone help me having show() end up with display:inline-block instead of block?
[13:44:14] <Ankabout> kborchers, pm?
[13:44:15] <djQuery> Articate: that again? scroll back up where I answered you before
[13:44:27] <Articate> I tried it, djQuery
[13:44:33] <kborchers> Ankabout: sure, kinda busy though
[13:44:37] <djQuery> ?demo@articate
[13:44:38] <bot-t> articate, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:45:04] <djQuery> Articate: what version of jquery are u using
[13:45:21] <tiffoknee> my query in more readable form.. http://pastebin.com/E5n5HLmd
[13:45:24] <Pathos> any body?
[13:46:02] <Pathos> is there anyway to consolidate in jquery events the two buttons get the app and watch the video?
[13:46:04] <Articate> 1.3.2.min
[13:46:40] <Pathos> getapp and video click functions in the code
[13:46:45] <djQuery> Articate: that might be the issue
[13:47:03] <Articate> I'll try upgrading :)
[13:47:09] <Pathos> im trying to think how i would write  function to call withint he click event and pass params that way instead of having code duplicated
[13:47:16] <djQuery> Pathos: still not clicking a facebook link
[13:48:04] <tiffoknee> pathos: you need to be a bit more specific, you look like a dodgy spammer atm
[13:48:36] <Pathos> you have some vision
[13:48:46] <Pathos> I didn't know you could see people from IRC
[13:48:48] <Pathos> :)
[13:49:11] <Pathos> http://bit.ly/o9flrB
[13:49:25] <Pathos> please don't paste the real web address in here.
[13:49:30] <Pathos> that's all I request.
[13:49:48] <Pathos> this is me unofficially seeking advise.
[13:50:00] <Pathos> though I haven't signed any NDA or anything
[13:50:44] <vmg> salutare all
[13:52:24] <djQuery> Pathos: so moved from some crap facebook link that I wont click to some url shorting link that I also wont click on, that most likely just goes to the same facebook link
[13:52:38] <Pathos> eh, whatever.
[13:52:49] <djQuery> try jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com instead pathos
[13:52:57] <Pathos> djquery, check msg
[13:54:28] <Pathos> I've already pasted the code on pastebin and linked it as well
[13:54:47] <Articate> djQuery: that worked :)
[13:54:54] <Pathos> djquery, thanks
[13:54:55] <Ankabout> djQuery, what's wrong with a facebook link if I may ask?
[13:55:14] <Pathos> djquery, also, I think my code might be redundant as it seems to be duplicated
[13:55:36] <Pathos> djquery, if you check the functionality by clicking navbar, and the two buttons you'll see it work sfine and it should work like that exactly, but i think my code could be better
[13:56:04] <Pathos> djquery, what is your opinion?
[13:57:13] <Pathos> djquery, also the Cybercrime Index is fairly reasonably accurate
[13:57:17] <Pathos> :)
[13:57:25] <Pathos> or else I failed! haha
[13:57:50] <djQuery> Pathos: have they taken into consideration all the stollen certificates of recent
[13:58:13] <Pathos> djquery, this is the FB front end. The real app can be viewed at http://www.nortoncybercrimeindex.com
[13:58:29] <Pathos> djquery, yes I have.
[13:59:13] <Pathos> I've just always kind of avoided frontend work ... always.
[13:59:23] <Pathos> Now it seems I need to learn it and get on with the show
[13:59:34] <Pathos> any advise would be helpful.
[13:59:43] <riskish> I have an image, and I want to set an origin point (x,y) somewhere on this image, and let the user grab anywhere else on the image and rotate it about that origin point. Is this possible with JQuery?
[13:59:45] <djQuery> Pathos: by the way u need to do some chaining to remove duplicate selectors   or just set multiple css  \ attr at once
[13:59:56] <Pathos> ahh
[13:59:58] <Pathos> ok
[14:00:13] <djQuery> .attr({ 'class': ' ', style: ' '});
[14:00:28] <Pathos> i see
[14:00:39] <djQuery> Pathos: both .css and .attr accept this
[14:01:10] <Pathos> btw
[14:01:23] <vmg> hi valve
[14:01:24] <valve> Hi, I am a pythonic irc bot!
[14:01:25] <Pathos> djquery, I'm sorry to hear about whatever happened to you
[14:01:46] <Pathos> djquery, hasn't happened to me yet. Still I keep my fingers crossed anytime I make online purchases
[14:02:02] <djQuery> Pathos:  2nd time in as many years for me
[14:03:46] <Pathos> am I an idiot?
[14:03:48] <Pathos> $('#getappt').is(':visible') ? $("#getappt").show() : $("#getappt").show();
[14:03:57] <Pathos> could this be replaced with just .show() ?
[14:04:07] <Pathos> I'm not .. I can' think.
[14:04:10] <Pathos> blah!
[14:04:39] <Ankabout> any reason why this would not work in FF?  if(event.offsetY > ($(this).height() / 2)) {
[14:05:47] <djQuery> Pathos: why when you do a toggle right before it?
[14:06:12] <Pathos> is my logic flawed?
[14:07:42] <djQuery> Pathos: well why toggle it if you are just going to show it on the next line?
[14:08:19] <Pathos> I was thinking that too
[14:08:33] <Articate> I have two tables of which only one is shown at a time. So I do hide("slow") on one, and show("slow") on the other, but the hiding and showing overlaps - is there a time to "halt" until the hiding is done?
[14:08:38] <Pathos> I think I might have forgotten to comment that line out/take it out from a previous rev
[14:08:38] <djQuery> ?togglefade
[14:08:40] <bot-t> djQuery, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[14:10:01] <Articate> ok, they're three tables, djQuery :p
[14:10:24] <janthony> I have some images loading a hidden element in the dom that be shown later. They are loaded in via an ajax request. After the POST response in console, it's displaying a red error in Firefox, saying NetworkError: 403 Forbidden. Why is this displaying in the console? Shouldn't this be displayed in the response tab instead from the php response?
[14:10:37] <janthony> loading inside a hidden element*
[14:10:56] <djQuery> Pathos: by the way in your #agree click    $('#agreed').fadeToggle($(this).is(':checked'));
[14:11:02] <janthony> It's displaying the error for some of the images it couldn't load into the dom basically.
[14:11:32] <Articate> djQuery: how can I halt it when there are three buttons and three corresponding tables?
[14:12:23] <Articate> oh, show('slow', function() { }? :)
[14:12:35] <janthony> I don't get why it's not just returning a broken image with the response via AJAX vs having to output an error to console.
[14:12:39] <djQuery> articate .hide('slow', fucntion(){ $('selector').show('slow);})
[14:13:13] <Pathos> ahh
[14:13:14] <Pathos> I see
[14:13:18] <Pathos> cool
[14:13:45] <Pathos> djquery, https://www.nortonsocial.com/download/cci.gadget <- desktop gadget too :D
[14:13:59] <Pathos> btw, I don't work for symantec.
[14:14:27] <Pathos> djquery, that's a cool function fadetoggle
[14:14:33] <djQuery> Pathos: You attempted to reachwww.nortonsocial.com, but instead you actually reached a server identifying itself asnortonsocial.com.
[14:14:46] <djQuery> Pathos: by the way i used to work for McAfee
[14:15:01] <Pathos> oh
[14:15:02] <Pathos> wait
[14:15:11] <Pathos> I'm pretty sure www. active
[14:15:22] <djQuery> laters
[14:15:32] <Pathos> well yeah, anyway, thanks
[14:15:33] <Pathos> now I got more work to figure out
[14:15:34] <Pathos> hah
[14:16:27] <euge> hey guys, been digging around online for a while, anyone have pointers to examples of selectable + dropppable?
[14:16:29] <aavikkojootti> my ajax-requests are not working if there is no trailing / in url. Why and how to fix this?
[14:16:59] <Ankabout> any reason why this would not work in FF?  if(event.offsetY > ($(this).height() / 2)) {
[14:18:26] <Pathos> djquery, thanks for that. fixed. ok bye
[14:18:47] <aavikkojootti> http://samulilager.appspot.com/p/testpage here demostration of the problem
[14:19:50] <Articate> hmmmm
[14:20:15] <Articate> the way I'm doing it is now is iterate over all the tables, check if it's the one to hide or not, then do what needs to be done
[14:20:51] <Articate> instead I need to hide the ones that are not the one I need to show, before showing the one to show..
[14:32:07] <helpcrypto> hi
[14:32:16] <helpcrypto> i have a div with an id, and inner ul
[14:32:28] <helpcrypto> its $("3id ul") goig to select that?
[14:32:35] <helpcrypto> its $("#id ul") goig to select that?
[14:33:54] <helpcrypto> ?
[14:33:57] <somebody__> yes
[14:33:58] <Ankabout> helpcrypto, it should
[14:34:14] <Ankabout> any reason why this would not work in FF (works fine in IE and Chrome)?  if(event.offsetY > ($(this).height() / 2)) {
[14:35:14] <helpcrypto> and to set style width and margin...?
[14:35:32] <helpcrypto> attr("style","width:...");?
[14:36:24] <helpcrypto> or .css(prop, val);
[14:37:07] <helpcrypto> its like this ok?
[14:37:10] <enjoycrf> is there a way to get a functions name inside the function
[14:37:16] <helpcrypto> $("#header ul").css("width","500px");  and $("#header ul").css("margin-left","250px";); ?
[14:37:30] <helpcrypto> or it needs ";" ?
[14:37:41] <enjoycrf> it doesnt
[14:37:51] <helpcrypto> its not ok?
[14:37:54] <enjoycrf> doesnt need px either
[14:38:07] <enjoycrf> or quotes
[14:38:30] <helpcrypto> quotes are ok?
[14:38:51] <enjoycrf> just google jquery css
[14:40:12] <helpcrypto> here they use this: $( this ).css( "width","+=200" );
[14:40:22] <helpcrypto> sio i guess was with "200" at least
[14:40:35] <helpcrypto> not only 200 (without quotes)
[14:45:41] <Ankabout> .mousemove(function(event))  -> event.offsetY doesn't evaluate in FF.  why not?
[14:47:06] <Techdeck> ajpiano, hello there saviour, are you around?
[14:49:18] <DyeA> hey all, kind of tangential to query but I swear i bookmarked a site/page recently that had a really nicely formatted list of regex patterns, now I need it and I can't find it, thought it was from smashing but don't see it in their twitter. Anybody else see something like that in the past month or two?
[14:57:10] <esparkman> hey fellas
[14:57:28] <esparkman> what are some good sites for jQuery resources?
[14:57:45] <esparkman> i looking for some advanced Drag and Drop tutorials
[14:58:51] <Kamakazi_> esparkman: like JQueryUI drag and drop?
[14:59:13] <esparkman> Kamakazi_: yeah
[14:59:28] <esparkman> Kamakazi_: not really looking for any kind of plugins
[15:02:06] <tiffoknee> change will not target any class that's added by js, that seems to be the problem. Has anyone come across this?
[15:03:33] <metropolis> In my css stylesheet, I have ".page-hidden {display: none}" -- is it possible in jquery to change that to be ".page-hidden  {display: block}" so that new elements which are created in the dom and have the "page-hidden" class will be visible ? That is, can I globally change a property of the stylesheet at runtime?
[15:06:24] <mytoz> metropolis: doesn't sound like you're doing it right, but here: $("<style/>").html(".page-hidden {display:block;}").appendTo("body");
[15:07:38] <metropolis> mytoz: I know it feels like there's an impedance mismatch here, or something. basically, I have a bunch of elements, some of which are hidden, and sometimes I want to globally turn off hiding.
[15:08:31] <metropolis> and so I'd like to be able to just add a new element to my page, and not have to pollute my "add an element" logic with my "are we displaying them right now or not" view

[15:22:19] <Shwaiil> Q: I'm wondering if there's a way to remove "autocomplete" from inputboxes ? Thanks
[15:22:20] <eveningsky> metropolis:  keep everything contained in a single element, then show and hide that element as needed. http://jsfiddle.net/sgEr4/2/

[15:28:51] <muzone> Can this be made into a more elegant oneliner?
[15:28:51] <muzone> var h = $("#main_menu > li > ul").height();
[15:28:52] <muzone> $("#main_menu > li > ul > li").height(h);
[15:32:01] <sammmy> oh hai
[15:32:27] <muzone> hey sammmy
[15:32:32] <muzone> so what you think? can it be done?
[15:32:36] <sammmy> muzone: :)
[15:33:01] <sphinxxx> anyone know why this is returning null  console.log($(data).filter('#hour_00').html());
[15:33:07] <sphinxxx> the id is definitely there
[15:33:16] <sammmy> So, I'm using jquery a lot to take an element and add, wrap and minipulate in every which way to create a new, awesome, fully function "complex element"; example being a textarea with a counter.
[15:33:17] <sphinxxx> data is a return from an ajax call, a bunch of html code
[15:34:31] <sammmy> My question is, when a new textarea with a specific class or something is added to the dom, how could I make it to where it runs some code that will manipulate it into the awesome widget-like element thingy?
[15:35:04] <sammmy> in other words, is there a sort of .live handle for when a new kind of element is added to the dom that matches a selector?
[15:39:06] <eveningsky> sphinxxx: I think you mean find not filter
[15:43:10] <imanc> hey folks -     $('ul.categoryitems a').each( function(index, elem) {     which returns an <a href="">assfda</a>
[15:43:37] <imanc> but I can't do elem.attr('href')  I get "uncaught type error"
[15:43:41] <imanc> any ideas how I can get the href?
[15:46:09] <eveningsky> sammmy: I think you would need to wrap $.fn.append with a function that triggers a custom event.
[15:46:35] <sammmy> that is bull$hit
[15:46:42] * sammmy is not serious
[15:46:54] <sammmy> shouldn't jquery have this type of functionality built in? :D
[15:47:07] <sammmy> what if the append function called this special binding event
[15:47:46] <eveningsky> sammmy: i think its an edge case. one of those things that could be useful, but isn't useful enough to enough people to be  worth maintaining.
[15:48:02] <sammmy> so that I could just do $(selector).bind('new', function(){ ... }); and then everytime an new element that matches the selector is appended to the dom, tada!
[15:48:12] <sammmy> eveningsky: aw
[15:48:29] <eveningsky> sammmy: yeah, it sounds cool.
[15:49:02] <muzone> Can this be made into a more elegant oneliner?
[15:49:02] <muzone> var h = $("#main_menu > li > ul").height();
[15:49:03] <muzone> $("#main_menu > li > ul > li").height(h);
[15:49:35] <eveningsky> sammmy: you can build a plugin for it and make people happy with your tada awesomeness
[15:49:39] <muzone> or should i keep it as it is?
[15:49:42] <muzone> eveningsky?
[15:49:45] <muzone> sammmy?
[15:50:01] <eveningsky> muzone: elegant in what way?
[15:50:03] <tiffoknee> goddammit. any ideas why this theu: $(".isActive #id_26 option:selected").attr("title"),    is only returning the first selected value and then never switching? it's delegated on change and fires every time - just only ever returns that first value :S
[15:50:45] <muzone> eveningsky: like simpler or whatever
[15:50:56] <muzone> eveningsky: you know what i mean
[15:51:02] <muzone> eveningsky: "Can it be improved?" rather
[15:51:16] <Blazento> how can i get the result of my ajax request outside of its success function?
[15:51:50] <sammmy> eveningsky: good point
[15:52:04] <sammmy> muzone: ... hmmm... ...
[15:52:41] <sammmy> eveningsky: how'd you go about doing it, you just rewrite the .append method? :P
[15:54:59] <eveningsky> blazento store it in a variable that is outside the functions scope.
[15:55:16] <Blazento> like window?
[15:55:26] <muzone> eveningsky?
[15:55:31] <Blazento> window.data... sorry n/m...
[15:55:39] <eveningsky> muzone. I'm not sure what you're after. it can be made into one line, but it's not any prettier or easier to read.
[15:55:53] <muzone> ok
[15:55:58] <muzone> well thats pretty much what i wanted to know
[15:56:19] <ajpiano> muzone: huh
[15:56:19] <muzone> var h = $("ul").height();
[15:56:21] <muzone> $("ul > li").height(h);
[15:56:26] <muzone> i wanted to take the height of the ul
[15:56:29] <muzone> and apply it to the lis
[15:56:32] <eveningsky> Blazento: that's the idea, though preferably you avoid the window object.
[15:57:08] <ajpiano> muzone: you can do $("ul").height(function(i, h) { $(this).children().height(h);  } )
[15:57:36] <Blazento> the next line of code after the ajax request fires before my ajax call does
[15:58:02] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
[15:58:05] <ajpiano> Blazento:
[15:58:06] <ajpiano> ^^
[15:58:11] <ajpiano> ajax is asychronous
[15:58:13] <muzone> ajpiano: hehe
[15:58:24] <muzone> nice oneliner
[15:58:29] <muzone> although i must admit eveningsky was right
[15:59:04] <muzone> I'm trying to center my mega dropdown menu (http://jsfiddle.net/HShGz/) - by making it left: 50%, and giving it a width and a negative width/2 left margin (with jQuery) - but so far it doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/gPGt3/ - might somebody know why?
[15:59:30] <ajpiano> yea looks like eveningsky has got everything on lock here
[15:59:33] * ajpiano goes back to day off
[16:01:07] <Blazento> cool website
[16:01:13] <muzone> thanks Blazento
[16:01:28] <Blazento> did you make that muzone ?
[16:01:29] <muzone> i've spent a couple of days on this dropdown menu
[16:01:40] <muzone> it's not THAT cool, but i guess it's alright
[16:07:36] <eveningsky> muzone: why are you setting the ul's width to it's own width?
[16:09:26] <muzone> yeah i probably should take that line out:-)
[16:13:48] <enjalot> hello, i'm trying to do an ajax call within my backbone.js app and there seems to be no response: http://www.pasteall.org/24671/javascript
[16:14:03] <enjalot> of all my console.logs i only see the first and last 'sup' and 'done jquerying'
[16:14:09] <mehwork> $.fn and jQuery.fn do the same things right?
[16:18:28] <_numbers> i'm trying to do some client-side scraping of remote domains. is it possible?
[16:18:34] <_numbers> like to have my site test.local    run some .js   that can http GET any public domain like http://www.google.com/  and parse the returned HTML as XML using jQuery selectors?
[16:19:44] <snover> no.
[16:19:56] <eveningsky> muzone, margin-left: (parentwidth - width)/2
[16:20:55] <eveningsky> enjalot, your request is probably failing. does firebug show you what kind of response your getting?
[16:21:29] <MagicFrog> hi all !
[16:21:32] <muzone> eveningsky: what is parentwidth?
[16:21:33] <eveningsky> mehwork: in most setups, $ === jQuery
[16:22:02] <MagicFrog> got one stupid question and i need your advice :
[16:22:22] <eveningsky> mehwork: you can be sure, by wrapping everything you do inside of (function ($){ ... }(jQuery));
[16:22:48] <MagicFrog> $('#testDiv1').css({'background':'#0F0' }); works great but
[16:23:05] <eveningsky> muzone: $("#main_menu > li").width();
[16:23:19] <eveningsky> the parent of what you're trying to center
[16:23:21] <MagicFrog> why does it have to prevent the defaut rendering on :hover specified in the stylesheet to be executed ?
[16:24:06] <muzone> eveningsky: i understand that but i dont see how its width is relevant
[16:24:16] <muzone> eveningsky: its only the dropdown itself im trying to center
[16:26:59] <enjalot> eveningsky: i'm in chrome and safari, neither give any kind of indication of error
[16:27:27] <MagicFrog> in fact : for a dom object dynamically styled with css(), do you think there is a way to handle the :hover style using the stylesheet instead of having to place some listeners everywhere ,
[16:29:40] <EJFox> Hi, I have a string (an SVG file, actually) and I'm looking at changing the header. I ant to find everything before </desc> and replace it with my own string. I'm super bad at regexes and I'm not even sure where to start. How do I search for a string, remove everything that occurs before that string, and replace it with my own?
[16:30:23] <eveningsky> enjalot: look in the network tab of your dev tools. what is the status code?
[16:31:03] <enjalot> eveningsky: its 200, and when i click on it i see my data weird
[16:37:46] <Kamakazi_> slightly more general question, what does everybody use for source control/version control?
[16:37:53] <eveningsky> enjalot: hmm??? you should be good then
[16:38:37] <enjalot> eveningsky: i'm wondering if my data isn't proper json maybe jquery is rejecting it?
[16:41:53] <snover> EJFox: you can not use a regular expression to do that.
[16:43:11] <enjalot> eveningsky: that seems to be the problem. if i switch to $.ajax and specify text format it executes fine
[16:44:41] <eveningsky> yeah, I was just about to say that. use jslint to find the problem with your data
[16:45:45] <bot-t> jQuery 1.4 and Malformed JSON  Katz Got Your Tongue? - http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/15/jquery-1-4-and-malformed-json/
[16:47:06] <snover> wrong tool.
[16:49:14] <eveningsky> snover: what tool do you suggest?
[16:49:41] <snover> jslint is for javascript, and is stupidly prescriptive. jsonlint is for json.
[16:54:55] <EJFox> snover: Why can't I use regex to do that? What would you suggest to use instead?
[16:56:30] <snover> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6751105/why-its-not-possible-to-use-regex-to-parse-html-xml-a-formal-explanation-in-lay
[16:56:53] <EJFox> Thanks for taking the time to look that up, snover.
[16:56:56] <EJFox> I'll take a look now
[16:58:57] <bedspax> hi guys
[16:59:01] <bedspax> i want to know which class have a div
[16:59:19] <bedspax> which is the best and efficient way?
[16:59:24] <coldhead> onwership is not transitive, bro
[16:59:26] <bedspax> faster*
[16:59:26] <coldhead> the div has a class
[16:59:31] <coldhead> the class doesn't have a div
[16:59:44] <bedspax> ok sorry, i'm Nigerian
[16:59:59] <bedspax> my english sucks
[17:00:00] <enjalot> thanks snover, you helped solve my invalid json issue
[17:00:16] <coldhead> $('div').attr('class')
[17:00:29] <bedspax> and for gettin all class?
[17:00:32] <bedspax> that one div, have?
[17:00:59] <coldhead> you can change the $('div') part as needed
[17:01:02] <coldhead> $(this)
[17:01:06] <coldhead> $('div:last')
[17:01:28] <bedspax> because i need to remove one class and adding another
[17:01:31] <bedspax> i have 4 class
[17:01:36] <bedspax> now I use:
[17:01:58] <coldhead> $('div.aids').toggleClass('aids flowers');
[17:02:02] <bedspax> $("#div").removeClass('left right top');
[17:02:07] <coldhead> that turns div.aids into div.flowers
[17:02:27] <bedspax> $("#div").addClass('bottom');
[17:02:36] <bedspax> but i don't know if now is faster..
[17:02:50] <bedspax> because REALLY the div have Only one of that 3 class 'left, right or top'
[17:02:57] <bedspax> but I don't know which
[17:03:00] <EJFox> snover:  Reading through this SO post, it looks like I might have a case where regex is called for. He talks about "When you need a one-time update of your HTML files, and you know the structure is consistent." - that's my case. I basically want to split my string at </desc>- throw out everything before and including </desc> and replace it with my new string- now I admit regex may not be the best solution for this- I'm just not sure what
[17:03:05] <bedspax> you understand me? Sorry for my english
[17:04:10] <coldhead> bedspax: i think you can just removeClass('for classes it may not even have')
[17:04:18] <coldhead> it really isn't going to take long
[17:04:23] <coldhead> or break anything
[17:04:54] <bedspax> for classes it may not even have ?
[17:04:57] <bedspax> sorry i dont understand
[17:05:52] <bedspax> and.. that case that i'v explayned up it's one of 4 cases
[17:06:11] <bedspax> *explained
[17:06:20] <bedspax> the case*
[17:07:19] <bedspax> coldhead, ?
[17:09:16] <danheberden> who do i talk to about sending a check for $3000 so that i can share a large inheritance?
[17:10:17] <jedimind_> me
[17:10:37] <jedimind_> oh wait you said 3,000? not interested, i only deal with scams of 50,000+
[17:11:04] <danheberden> haha, i work on open source software - like i'd have $50k
[17:13:17] <bedspax> di'o por, co
[17:14:01] <buremba> is there a javascript plugin for applying css3 features to all modern browsers?
[17:14:02] <coldhead> bedspax: you can use $('#spam').removeClass('bottom right left top coffee hungerdonger')
[17:14:11] <bedspax> ah
[17:14:14] <coldhead> it will be okay
[17:14:18] <buremba> for example I define box-shadow and during the rendering process javascript detect browser and for example apply -moz-boz-shadow property.
[17:14:25] <coldhead> everything is going to be okay forever
[17:14:27] <bedspax> ok, also if the div spam have only one of that 4 classes?
[17:15:06] <danheberden> div spam
[17:15:20] <coldhead> then afterwards it will have none of those classes
[17:15:26] <coldhead> i don't know what you're worried about
[17:15:35] <danheberden> the apocalypse
[17:15:45] <coldhead> if it doesn't have the class CHAMPAGNE and then you remove that class...
[17:15:51] <coldhead> it still won't have it
[17:15:59] <coldhead> and we can all get on with our lvies
[17:16:01] <aaroninfidel> can someone suggest how I could write this better? https://gist.github.com/1199371
[17:16:02] <coldhead> lives*
[17:16:16] <coldhead> it's not like when you overdraw from your nigerian bank account
[17:16:21] <snover> buremba: this is why lesscss and sass exist
[17:16:26] <coldhead> and the bank manager chases you
[17:16:31] <snover> the solution is not add javascript!!111
[17:17:05] <danheberden> aaroninfidel capture all the events on the top most container of the carousel
[17:17:07] <snover> holy chain from hell
[17:17:12] <danheberden> and handle them form there
[17:17:16] <aaroninfidel> danheberden: then how would I filter?
[17:17:40] <danheberden> if event.target.name === "next" or some shit, i donno
[17:17:51] <danheberden> or use a pre-existing carousel?
[17:17:52] <draginx> Did anyone get jQuery ajax XML to work with MSIE?
[17:18:58] <aaroninfidel> danheberden: this event list isn't just for each carousel item
[17:19:25] <aaroninfidel> its for opening, closing, opening model windows, adding items in the carousel to cart, etc.
[17:19:45] <aaroninfidel> but all buttons are within the container.
[17:19:46] <SIDU> coldhead: i wonder how nigerian withdraw your oz money, when you just told them your bank account number?
[17:20:08] <SIDU> coldhead: is that just a made-up story?
[17:20:09] <danheberden> aaroninfidel your first best step would be to not chain the whole thing
[17:20:22] <danheberden> just assign some top level things to variables and go from there
[17:20:35] <SIDU> coldhead: how can someone withdraw your money if he only knows your acc number?
[17:20:40] <aaroninfidel> danheberden: yes, but this isn't my code, and I'm a long time JS Mobile Ninja, but this is my first time using jQuery.
[17:21:22] <aaroninfidel> so, I'm asking for a recommended way in a work around with jQuery rather then writing my own JS Library :P
[17:21:41] <aaroninfidel> I understand that I need to listen to the parent
[17:21:42] <danheberden> i'm not saying don't use jquery, or to write your own library
[17:21:53] <danheberden> just saying you don't need to chain everything
[17:22:00] <aaroninfidel> but, how would I filter through the elements?
[17:22:10] <danheberden> no to mention that code is wrong
[17:22:13] <danheberden> namely, line 1
[17:22:20] <aaroninfidel> so if (element is clicked check to see if its this element, or this one, or this one)
[17:22:36] <aaroninfidel> danheberden: line 1 is just a placeholder, sorry.
[17:22:45] <aaroninfidel> I didn't wanna paste all 1200 lines of code. :P
[17:22:57] <imanc> get it pasted son
[17:23:06] <danzik17> aaroninfidel: Are all 1200 lines chained?  If so, I wanna see this
[17:23:07] <aaroninfidel> can't my client wouldn't be happy about that.
[17:23:31] <danheberden> just do like $carousel = $( '#omg' ); $carousel.find( 'div.arrow a').click( fn );
[17:23:42] <danheberden> not like 5 finds just to get to div.arrow
[17:24:29] <aaroninfidel> danzik17: well also the query is over qualified, it should just be .arrow a instead of using the div.arrow
[17:24:39] <aaroninfidel> but that will come next
[17:26:37] <danheberden> aaroninfidel using div.arrow vs .arrow is the least of your worries with this code
[17:27:45] <aaroninfidel> danheberden: ok thats great, but this still isn't helping me find a solution for filtering through these elements.
[17:28:05] <danheberden> you're already filtering through them
[17:28:06] <danheberden> with .find
[17:28:12] <danheberden> visit api.jquery.com
[17:28:29] <danheberden> jqfundamentals.com
[17:30:18] <aaroninfidel> ty
[17:33:30] <nichisichi> hello, is there any way to setup a system where there would be an input box, entering a number will take them to the respective post (each number will have the post title same)
[17:38:26] <opius> can someone explain how to do a proper .load.. http://jsfiddle.net/Q3ezr/ the problem is that the data fetched by the load isn't accessible until the second click
[17:42:12] <bbrandon> how would i refactor .removeClass('left).removeClass("indent_button")
[17:44:03] <kkuno> dudes
[17:44:09] <kkuno> I just love js and jquery
[17:44:13] <kkuno> <33
[17:44:41] <danzik17> bbrandon: .removecClass('left indent_button')
[17:45:19] <theCole> kkuno: what makes u say that?
[17:45:56] <kkuno> the fact that I'm becoming addicted to writing new js code
[17:46:00] <kkuno> dunno why
[17:46:09] <kkuno> I was thinking this today ^^
[17:47:00] <jaequery> anyone here use mootools?
[17:48:07] <astropirate> jaequery, <_<
[17:50:29] <imanc> does anyone have an idea about this?
[17:50:30] <imanc> http://www.pastie.org/2494670
[17:53:15] <merhaba> I know cross-domain problems bu is there any way to get a sites content with javascrip? If it's possible, I want to build a website tracking system. Today I saw a few script that do GET and POST requests with remote services that support  json response like FlyJSONP, that's why I'm asking this question?
[17:55:31] <merhaba> anyone: is there anyone?
[17:56:09] <jaequery> merhaba: i never tried flyjsonp, i wonder how it works
[17:56:21] <jaequery> only cross-domain i know of is HTML5 CORS and flxhr
[17:56:43] <jaequery> are you planning to scrape, random sites?
[17:57:32] <merhaba> it append domain like a script for example "<script src="http://storify.com/xdamman.json?callback=flyjsonp_8B02104E25E24BFE8BE40651EF7DEF63">"
[17:57:54] <jaequery> well then that's jsonp
[17:58:13] <jaequery> which means the server you are hitting needs to support it
[17:58:21] <merhaba> jaequery: no, the script will warn user when website content changed
[17:58:23] <merhaba> yes
[17:58:27] <merhaba> jsonp
[17:59:05] <jaequery> if thats the case, thats all you need ,jsonp
[18:00:05] <merhaba> I thought that maybe we can define a variable and assign website's content but it seems unpossible. :)
[18:10:43] <datarecall> when a text box changes what is the best way to get notified of the new value
[18:10:44] <datarecall> keydown ?
[18:13:49] <datarecall> http://jsfiddle.net/qKvK2/1/
[18:15:27] <danzik17> datarecall: keyup
[18:15:41] <datarecall> .change is the same thing is it not ?
[18:16:10] <Kamakazi_> is there a reason my jquery-ui datepicker would be STONKING HUGE
[18:16:10] <Kamakazi_> ?
[18:16:12] <danzik17> datarecall: As far as I know, change only files on blur.  If you want realtime input as their typing, I use keyup.
[18:16:28] <danzik17> s/files/fires
[18:17:13] <datarecall> http://jsfiddle.net/qKvK2/5/
[18:17:17] <datarecall> hmm still not firing properly
[18:17:40] <abjorn> http://thedailywh.at/2011/09/06/nuke-it-from-orbit-of-the-day-4/ this reminds me of the captured T-Rex in Jurassic Park: The Lost World. And we all know how that turned out.
[18:18:21] <Kamakazi_> nvm, StackOverflow to the rescue
[18:18:47] <danzik17> datarecall: Has nothing to do with the event, your parens/braces are all messed up.
[18:20:05] <datarecall> ahh thanks
[18:22:26] <Blazento> anyone use the draggable/dropable jquery plugins? when i drop draggable item A into dropable item B (trash can), how can i get reference to the draggable item that was dropped in... It seems on dropable's built-in events, i can only get reference to the trash can element
[18:32:07] <coldhead> SIDU: i have no idea how these things work
[18:33:08] <mrryanjohnston> if I want to take a large image and slice it up into 50x50 pixel shapes, is there a plugin that exists for this?
[18:33:31] <SIDU> coldhead: me too. i have been working in a bank for dozen years. and i doubt if someone can withraw money only based on your acc number. however there is too much news about it, so i never tell african guys my a/c
[18:36:43] <coldhead> SIDU: there is generally no need to tell anyone your account number, african or otherwise
[18:37:28] <cmal> So I have a string: var f = 'myFunction'
[18:37:44] <cmal> And a function: var myFunction = function () { blah };
[18:37:55] <cmal> How do I call the function using the string stored in f?
[18:38:24] <coldhead> mrryanjohnston: you could render it onto canvas and split that up. there might be canvas based plugins for that kind of thing but they won't work in browsers without canvas
[18:38:34] <cmal> I keep seeing to do something like: window[f]
[18:38:40] <cmal> but that doesn't seem to be working
[18:38:45] <mrryanjohnston> coldhead: yeah. It might be smarter for me to do the slicing serverside.
[18:39:01] <coldhead> (window[f])()
[18:39:01] <mrryanjohnston> I'm thinking about spawning an instance of imagemagick and slicing like that
[18:39:29] <coldhead> that's probably wise, mrryanjohnston
[18:39:31] <coldhead> good luck!
[18:39:51] <mrryanjohnston> coldhead: thanks. I'll need it :p
[18:41:25] <coldhead> cmal: window[f] will just return the function, you'll still need to execute it
[18:41:42] <cmal> and how do I execute the function after I've returned it?
[18:41:57] <coldhead> var invokeme = window[f]; invokeme();
[18:42:05] <coldhead> or what i suggested above, with ()s
[18:42:17] <cmal> oh, sorry didn't see about
[18:42:32] <coldhead> it was easily missed
[18:42:37] <coldhead> good luck!
[18:43:10] <cmal> thanks!
[18:56:27] <Kamakazi_> gotta love those splits
[18:57:26] <newb001> hey there
[18:58:30] <newb001> can some one tell em if when i cache a dom node by doing something like cacheobj1=$(".hitpoints"); , i also cache all of it's children and parent nodes?
[18:58:33] <cmal> coldhead: What if my function is within a function (plugin)? Do I have to use something else in place of window?
[18:59:20] <coldhead> yeah, that window thing assumes it's gonna be global
[18:59:35] <coldhead> can you put the function in an object?
[18:59:41] <coldhead> lemme fiddle
[19:01:09] <cmal> I could put it in an object, but it wouldn't be ideal for what I'm doing
[19:01:41] <coldhead> var funcname = "badger";
[19:01:41] <coldhead> (f[funcname])();
[19:01:43] <cmal> If it helps, both the function declaration AND the place I need to call it are within the same function
[19:01:48] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/Ds9n4/
[19:01:56] <cmal> lemme take a look
[19:02:30] <cmal> does the function have to be declared before the call?
[19:02:44] <coldhead> ?tias
[19:02:45] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:03:30] <coldhead> cmal: window is just taking the place of 'f' in my code, implicitly
[19:03:42] <coldhead> without window you gotta make a thing to put it in
[19:03:49] <cmal> k
[19:05:58] <ispirto> hello, i'm using a function for $('.datatable'), there are multiple tables with this class, i want to get the ids of those tables to use in the function. i've tried $(this).attr('id') but returns undefined
[19:06:22] <ispirto> http://pastebin.com/unzYK1RT
[19:06:47] <coldhead> that is how you should do it...
[19:07:01] <coldhead> 'this' is probably not the thing you think it is
[19:07:14] <coldhead> try console.log(this, $(this), $(this).attr('id'))
[19:07:24] <coldhead> and check what it actually is in the console
[19:08:44] <ispirto> let me try
[19:09:14] <ispirto> coldhead, where should i enter that?
[19:09:27] <coldhead> ispirto: http://pastebin.com/wwU0y9K4
[19:09:36] <coldhead> and if that doesn't work you'll need to use each()
[19:10:14] <ispirto> coldhead, that won't work because i'm getting the tables by $('.datatable')
[19:10:27] <ispirto> yeah, i'm trying to find an easier way, rather than using each
[19:10:39] <coldhead> http://pastebin.com/XtrCAjiu
[19:10:46] <coldhead> it's not a hard way
[19:10:52] <coldhead> and the alternative may not exist
[19:10:59] <coldhead> it's an internal matter for ispirto
[19:11:14] <coldhead> for datatables*, ispirto
[19:14:40] <ispirto> coldhead, thanks that worked
[19:14:59] <ispirto> i was using the var oTable part, too
[19:15:02] <ispirto> where should i define it
[19:17:49] <coldhead> ispirto: before or after, wherever you like, it won't matter
[19:18:08] <coldhead> var oTable = $('.datatable');
[19:18:20] <coldhead> then oTable.each(... if you like
[19:19:06] <ispirto> coldhead, i've tried but didn't work, i guess i've used it in wrong place
[19:19:10] <ispirto> http://pastebin.com/1iaJbLds
[19:19:54] <ispirto> also tried your version, too
[19:21:17] <coldhead> can you be more specific about how it doesn't work?
[19:21:46] <coldhead> i think it's better to do it in two steps: var oTable = $(...); then oTable.each(...
[19:21:49] <ispirto> it returns error, claiming it's not defined
[19:21:58] <ispirto> yeah tried that, too
[19:22:00] <ispirto> same error
[19:24:31] <coldhead> must be a scoping thing
[19:24:52] <ispirto> actually, i believe i have to define the var to datatable function
[19:25:01] <ispirto> since the other function i'm using is in this one
[19:25:14] <coldhead> ohh in which case each() won't work?
[19:25:15] <coldhead> fuuu
[19:25:25] <coldhead> well i hate datatables
[19:25:27] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[19:25:30] <ispirto> lol
[19:25:32] <ispirto> no problem
[19:37:45] <LekeFly> How can i remove all links from a div? :p
[19:38:29] <kborchers> LekeFly: $("#divID a").remove();
[19:38:56] <draginx> is there a way to log all events that are being triggered? O_o
[19:39:08] <LekeFly> kborchers: thanks!
[19:39:24] <kborchers> np
[19:43:04] <coldhead> draginx: if you look at the jquery source you can probably find a common event function that all events fire, and maybe modify it to do some logging
[19:45:33] <draginx> coldhead: thanks :)
[19:45:34] <draginx> doing a click off of a select.. how can i trigger an event with jq? ive tried.. blur, focusout, change, click, and select ;x
[19:46:17] <coldhead> i don't understand
[19:46:22] <coldhead> did you try ?trigger
[19:46:26] <coldhead> ?trigger
[19:46:27] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[19:47:12] <alabd> Good day all , when we select farsi here every thing is ok but the date will be copied into filed is julian ,ou date is in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars
[19:47:38] <draginx> uhhh im trying to trigger an event based off of me clicking on a select then clicking *anything* essentially i guess?
[19:47:47] <draginx> http://buildingblocks.spottedkoi.com/ on chrome.. inspect "Select City"
[19:47:56] <draginx> and ull see what i mean when u click, click again, then click one more time
[19:47:57] <coldhead> ?g outerclick jquery @ draginx
[19:47:58] <bot-t> draginx, jQuery outerClick plugin - http://littleroom.se/playground/outerClick/
[19:48:13] <coldhead> that's more clicking than i have time for sorry draginx :P
[19:48:14] <draginx> eh an entire plugin
[19:48:21] <coldhead> eh it's a 5 line plugin
[19:48:29] <coldhead> you can copy pasta the code if it makes you feel better
[19:48:35] <coldhead> why people gotta hate on plugins!
[19:49:04] <coldhead> brb making hotdogs
[19:49:08] <draginx> lol k
[20:02:54] <LekeFly> kborchers: hmm is there a way i can just remove links that .. dont contain a class eg? right now its removing links on images aswell hehe
[20:04:23] <kborchers> LekeFly: $("#divID a").not(".yourClass").remove();  try that
[20:06:14] <LekeFly> kborchers: Woho! :) thanks again.. had no idea you could just do a "not" :p
[20:06:56] <kborchers> no prob ... fyi, the docs are your friend ;)
[20:11:01] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. When using $.live(), can I use a variable name or do I have to use the raw selector: var something=$(".class"); something.live("click",function) or do I have to $(".class").live("click",function)?
[20:12:05] <Whirl3d> hello?
[20:12:47] <secoif> how can I tell when  specific element has been added to the page?
[20:13:06] <coldhead> it needs to be a selector, Whirl3d
[20:13:29] <coldhead> think about it, if you use a variable of elements already in the page it isn't really live is it
[20:13:55] <coldhead> secoif: there is no "new content" event you can bind to
[20:14:01] <secoif> dang
[20:14:08] <secoif> parent.change or something?
[20:14:14] <coldhead> if you know the data is coming via ajax you can bind to the ajaxCompelte event
[20:14:17] <coldhead> it's similar
[20:14:18] <coldhead> no buddy
[20:14:21] <secoif> :(
[20:14:27] <coldhead> you can't bind to dom modifications
[20:14:38] <Whirl3d> coldhead, thanks.
[20:14:39] <coldhead> (except in the newest shiniest browsers)
[20:14:46] <secoif> thanks coldhead. bugger
[20:15:00] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[20:15:02] <secoif> the event is added to the page by a 3rd party ajax thing
[20:15:27] <secoif> so it's a bit trickier to tap into the success callback
[20:15:34] <secoif> but I guess I could override it
[20:15:35] <secoif> hrm
[20:18:09] <coldhead> no no no, secoif!
[20:18:16] <coldhead> there's a global ajaxcomplete
[20:18:22] <coldhead> that fires when ajax is finished
[20:18:30] <coldhead> so you don't need to mess with their coads
[20:18:38] <coldhead> i use it all the time
[20:18:52] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[20:19:26] <elnoobest> hi
[20:19:48] <elnoobest> is it possible to check for a value on the url im currently at and add it to a series of links?
[20:20:08] <elnoobest> for example checking for &paged=x and x being any number?
[20:20:31] <secoif> ooooo
[20:20:38] <secoif> thanks coldhead I didn't know about that
[20:20:42] <elnoobest> or should I do that with php?
[20:21:27] <coldhead> elnoobest: you can do that in javascript
[20:21:41] <coldhead> window.location.href
[20:22:03] <elnoobest> Cool
[20:22:22] <elnoobest> and how do i search for only the part that i need?
[20:22:27] <coldhead> window.location.search
[20:22:55] <coldhead> i would try something like (window.location.search).split(/&/);
[20:23:04] <coldhead> that will give you an array of key=values to search
[20:23:16] <elnoobest> awesome
[20:25:33] <elnoobest> Should I do something like $link = (window.location.search).split(/&/); and then do something with $link[5] for example?
[20:26:55] <coldhead> yes
[20:27:09] <coldhead> get a working demo up on jsfiddle if you need more halp
[20:27:53] <elnoobest> awesome :) thanks a lot coldhead
[20:34:11] <coldhead> o
[20:35:49] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[20:55:07] <Pathos> o/
[20:55:17] <Pathos> what's going on guys?
[21:00:30] <imanc> not much Pathos - it's going West. rather than on
[21:04:45] <elnoobest> coldhead: are you still around?
[21:08:19] <coldhead> yes
[21:08:37] <coldhead> unfortunately i only have time for one question, elnoobest
[21:08:43] <coldhead> and you just used it asking if i was around
[21:08:45] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[21:08:47] <coldhead> LUNCH TIME
[21:08:51] <elnoobest> :o
[21:08:58] <elnoobest> lol :(
[21:09:30] <elnoobest> will this do the trick $('.test').attr('href'+ url[1]); ?
[21:10:09] <coldhead> no
[21:10:15] <coldhead> you need to get the href out first
[21:10:41] <elnoobest> oh
[21:10:42] <coldhead> var href = $(...).attr('href'); $(...).attr('href', href + url[0]);
[21:10:45] <coldhead> likesay
[21:11:00] <coldhead> capiche?
[21:11:26] <elnoobest> yes!
[21:11:30] <elnoobest> got it!
[21:11:41] <elnoobest> testing it right now
[21:13:08] <elnoobest> awesome :)
[21:13:11] <elnoobest> it worked
[21:13:17] <elnoobest> im just missing the &
[21:13:26] <elnoobest> thanks a lot
[21:13:41] <coldhead> good job
[21:15:34] <elnoobest> aaaaw
[21:15:38] <elnoobest> just one prob
[21:15:46] <elnoobest> i can use var href
[21:15:48] <elnoobest> can't
[21:15:55] <elnoobest> because there is more than one link
[21:15:59] <elnoobest> hmmm
[21:16:01] <elnoobest> plot thickens
[21:16:36] <elnoobest> should i do something like for each?
[21:18:13] <coldhead> sounds good to me!
[21:21:02] <elnoobest> it looks like im missing something here http://pastie.org/2495351
[21:48:10] <simonleojung> elnoobest: your missing the () after function
[21:51:41] <elnoobest> simonleojung: mind taking a look?
[21:52:42] <elnoobest> simonleojung: I've fixed it here http://pastie.org/2495443 but I still get the same href for all of the links
[21:53:04] <simonleojung> elnoobest: your missing the ( ) after the function like this: function()
[21:54:26] <elnoobest> sime
[21:54:31] <elnoobest> sorry bout that
[21:54:55] <elnoobest> yeah, i already fixed that, but I have a new prob :/
[21:57:13] <elnoobest> must be somerhing really dumb
[22:05:29] <simonleojung> elnoobest: try using var url = window.location.search.split("&")
[22:06:13] <elnoobest> ok! i thought there was somrthing wrong with my for each
[22:07:13] <simonleojung> oh ok sorry didn't see that you wanted to change the hrefs
[22:07:36] <elnoobest> yup, I forgot too hehe
[22:07:52] <elnoobest> that would work ok if it was only one link
[22:08:48] <simonleojung> yah just use this.attr('href')
[22:09:20] <simonleojung> sorry kind of trying to do 2 things at once :)   At least you got it :D
[22:10:06] <elnoobest> :D
[22:15:27] <noaXess> good morning -7:15 am here :)
[22:16:20] <coldhead> good morning
[22:16:21] <noaXess> can i change a dialog button function on the fly? maybe if i clicked the button do anything and change it's function?
[22:16:47] <noaXess> maybe with this? $('.ui-dialog-buttonpane').find('button:contains("'+webLanguage["Modul_Ecom_Basket_Next"]+'")').button...
[22:18:51] <elnoobest> i got completely lost
[22:46:21] <speaker123> when using .text(), is &nbsp; converted to a 'space'?  or is it possible to get an array of the symbols where each symbol need not be one character?
[22:47:10] <coldhead> ?eval $('<p>-&nbsp;-</p>').text()
[22:47:11] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: div is undefined
[22:47:18] <coldhead> oh sad
[22:48:34] <coldhead> speaker123: http://jsfiddle.net/mEUjt/
[22:48:37] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:48:38] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:49:32] <speaker123> coldhead, hmm...ok so I am doing some editing on the "text" and i need access to an array of the "symbols".
[22:49:36] <rosieres> hi, how can i delegate an event on load . . . ? http://jsfiddle.net/yZXLn/1/  on mouseover works . . . but i dont get it when the page is ready . . . what do i have to use for this purpose ?
[22:49:44] <speaker123> if i use 'text', i lose information about which was a nbsp and which was not
[22:50:01] <speaker123> if i use 'html', then i have to scan forward and backward to properly read the string
[22:50:02] <coldhead> html will get you the raw stuff with symbols intact
[22:50:07] <coldhead> and you can regex to extract them
[22:50:20] <coldhead> sounds like you're doing something dreadful :(
[22:50:38] <Cork> rosieres: delegate is for catching events
[22:50:41] <speaker123> i am trying to shuffle the elements in a span or something like that
[22:50:58] <Cork> rosieres: just set it to .hidden and then run your effect
[22:51:03] <Cork> or what ever you want to do
[22:51:04] <coldhead> pos856 is the worst variable name i have seen in days
[22:51:38] <coldhead> speaker123: i'd look for an html parser in JS
[22:51:41] <rosieres> Cork: Thought about hasClass but dunno how to use it in this case !
[22:51:49] <coldhead> one that will built you a tree of stuff with entities and all
[22:51:57] <coldhead> rather than slash my OWN wrists
[22:52:01] <Cork> rosieres: what is it you want to do?
[22:52:08] <speaker123> seems like this could become an issue with unicode symbols as well right?
[22:52:49] <rosieres> if an id element has a special class change the background position of another element
[22:53:10] <coldhead> yes, speaker123, there's a lot you might have to deal with
[22:53:19] <coldhead> broken symbols too :(
[22:53:46] <coldhead> scary stuff
[22:54:14] <rosieres> Cork: if an id element has a special class change the background position of another element ...
[22:54:17] <Cork> rosieres: uh.. thats not what your old code does
[22:54:29] <rosieres> Cork: right . . . i know . . .
[22:54:50] <Cork> rosieres: you would have to run a check after you've modified it
[22:55:14] <Cork> theres no cross browser event for modifying attributes
[22:55:26] <rosieres> cork: the problem was for me to combine has class with the function . . .
[22:56:03] <Cork> if($('#id').hasClass('my-class')) {} else {}
[22:56:16] <coldhead> Cork: let's just fork jquery and add a "dommodified" event
[22:56:25] <coldhead> it's easier than having to explain over and over
[22:56:30] <coldhead> (i assume)
[22:57:30] <Cork> coldhead: good luck when its the underlying dom that doens't support it :)
[22:57:57] <Cork> you would have to add a recursive search through the dom and check for modifications >_<
[22:58:07] <Cork> on a setInterval loop
[22:58:15] * Cork pukes in a corner
[22:58:39] <rosieres> Cork: Stupid easy ! - Thank you !
[23:00:04] <tonyjcamp> Can anyone help me understand this syntax? The semi-colon before the opening paren is messing with me.      ;(function() {})();
[23:00:29] <tonyjcamp> I've seen this pattern when creating plugins.
[23:01:58] <tonyjcamp> ajpiano: if you're around, can you drop some knowledge on me about this? I'm staring at it on a plugin template you wrote.
[23:03:29] <coldhead> ajpiano has today off
[23:03:33] <coldhead> also it's 2am for him
[23:03:43] <coldhead> (also he hates you)
[23:03:48] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:04:10] <tonyjcamp> I figured he might not be here :( and he probably does hate me
[23:05:02] <coldhead> no i'm sure he'll be back and refreshed and eager to help in about 7 hours
[23:05:16] <coldhead> in the meantime, perhaps someone else could help!
[23:05:21] <coldhead> not me, obviously
[23:05:28] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:05:41] <tonyjcamp> $.lies
[23:05:56] <coldhead> it's the evening of my first day
[23:06:03] <tonyjcamp> that's more like it
[23:06:53] <coldhead> danheberden wants to help
[23:06:55] <coldhead> he knows things
[23:07:06] <tonyjcamp> orly?
[23:07:35] <coldhead> ?time danheberden
[23:07:37] <bot-t> coldhead, Portland, OR - Time: 23:07 Tuesday (PDT), Weather: Clear, 22C / 71F
[23:08:02] <tonyjcamp> That's rad, didn't know about that command.
[23:09:10] <coldhead> it only works if you've told bot-t your location
[23:09:16] <coldhead> he respects your privacy
[23:09:23] <coldhead> ?botsnack
[23:09:24] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[23:09:35] <tonyjcamp> Hungry bot
[23:10:25] <tonyjcamp> @boaz knows things too, maybe he knows
[23:10:36] <tonyjcamp> Probably hates me though.
[23:10:58] <infid> anyone know why google chrome's Developer Tools refuse to let me edit javascript dynamically? I click and double-click on javascript in the 'Scripts' tab like i'm supposed to and nothing ever happens. I've tried it in ubuntu 10.04 LTS on 3 different machines using different versions of chrome, including the 14.x beta and 15.x developer channel versions.
[23:11:01] <coldhead> he is way too busy sipping champagne and getting handjobs to help out in #jQuery
[23:11:14] <infid> yet somehow it works in my 13.0 chrome install on windows 7 :|
[23:11:19] <coldhead> he has a thuglife tattoo ON HIS TEETH
[23:11:29] <tonyjcamp> Didn't he invent hand jobs or something? I thought I heard someone tell me that.
[23:11:49] <tonyjcamp> What color tattoo?
[23:11:54] <coldhead> white
[23:11:56] <Trisox> coldhead
[23:11:57] <Trisox> :D
[23:12:06] <coldhead> mm, maybe you'd call it "wheat"
[23:12:14] <coldhead> "milky tea"
[23:12:15] <tonyjcamp> eggshell?
[23:12:21] <tonyjcamp> baby batter?
[23:12:45] <coldhead> infid: maybe it's ubuntu 10.04 somehow, it never works for me either
[23:12:51] <coldhead> ew
[23:12:53] <Eviltwin> infid: Is it pretty printed?
[23:16:42] <{-_-\\\> omfg

[23:37:36] <amh345> im lading content into a modal via replaceWith. i find that when i click the link to load the content only a partial content loads.  it takes 2 clicks of the link to load all the content properly.  has anyone seen this before?   .html does the same thing.
[23:38:04] <coldhead> that is bizarre amh345
[23:38:09] <coldhead> i've never seen anything like that
[23:39:59] <amh345> i'm trying to debug it. not having much luck.   for example i have a <p></p> tag in the modal and just after it i have some content that loads in a div. the <p> tag loads on first click and the div content loads on second click
[23:40:07] <ndss56> hi, how to make textarea scroll to bottom on focus?
