[01:07:33] <UltraMC> I am using tooltip(); - when moving mouse fast I can hover the tooltip and it's becoming an active element (other so far active elements becoming unactive). Its irritating - how to prevent this?
[01:08:25] <UltraMC> As you know when tooltip is hovered than element that is responsible for showing tooltip is inactive - so tooltip dissapears, than appears again 'coz mouse is still over element
[01:25:37] <UltraMC> How to show tooltip(); on top of the mouse?

[03:02:39] <Noeble> question: I have a draggable object inside an iframe. As long as I drag it within the iframe it works fine! But if I drag the object and mobe the mouse outside the iframe it hangs up
[03:03:03] <Noeble> what happens is that I can release the mouse and move back into the iframe and the draggable object will follow my mouse until I click again
[03:03:13] <Noeble> anyone know why this happens, and how to fix it?
[03:07:02] <Prost> somebody please help!
[03:07:13] <Prost> I have an autocomplete and its not working !!
[03:07:29] <Prost> i have spend 9 hours on it now.. its frying my mind
[03:07:32] <Prost> *spent
[03:31:17] <shoky> ?demo @ Prost
[03:31:18] <bot-t> Prost, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:31:53] <Prost> gee, its on a clients site
[03:32:12] <Prost> but i can tell you that there is prototype on the page as well
[03:32:23] <shoky> that tells me nothing at all
[03:32:23] <Prost> i've tried using noconflict
[03:33:00] <Prost> but i've now come to know that
[03:33:12] <shoky> good luck getting help with "its not working !!"
[03:33:13] <Prost> .change() .blur() functions etc are not firing
[03:33:36] <Prost> shoky: I'll detail out as much as I can
[03:33:44] <shoky> reproduce the issue in a minimal testcase on jsfiddle
[03:33:52] <shoky> don't need all the client's site
[03:33:55] <Prost> i'll give it a shot, thanks shoky
[03:34:03] <shoky> just the autocomplete and enough to cause the problem to appear
[03:34:14] <Prost> its the default implementation :/
[03:34:21] <Prost> no changes to the demo on jquery ui's site either
[03:34:23] <shoky> that works on jqueryui.com right?
[03:34:27] <Prost> yea
[03:34:33] <shoky> anyway
[03:34:38] <shoky> no jquery works at all?
[03:34:43] <Prost> jquery works
[03:34:53] <Prost> i've tried doing console.log from within the init of the jquery autocomplete
[03:34:56] <Prost> and its fine.
[03:35:11] <Prost> console.log within the change, blur and focus dont seem to be firing
[03:35:29] <Prost> could it be conflicting with prototype?
[03:35:59] <shoky> lots of things could be
[03:37:26] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/8c94s/22/ <-- can someone help me out with this one, trying to trim down the options list
[03:37:29] <shoky> best way to find out.. remove prototype and see if it all works..

[03:47:17] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/8c94s/25/  <-- this one.. it seems working... just want to trim down passed time
[03:47:46] <BinaryKitten> still doesn't help explain .. sorry..
[03:47:56] <BinaryKitten> i see the input fields and a load of time things.
[03:48:01] <BinaryKitten> but what's the end purpose?
[03:48:35] <axscode> BinaryKitten: if you run this, it sets display none, passed time. so only possible time can be choosen..
[03:48:40] <Noeble> question: how can I unbind a draggable hander in an iframe when Iam clicking outside of it?
[03:48:47] <BinaryKitten> ahhh
[03:48:55] <axscode> BinaryKitten:  so i think there's one more problem..
[03:48:55] <BinaryKitten> now i get you
[03:49:50] <axscode> BinaryKitten: i need to put selected=selected on the first option after all hidden ones.
[03:50:05] <axscode> that one aint working.. can you help a bit on that.
[03:50:40] <BinaryKitten> yep
[03:50:48] <axscode> thanks
[03:56:42] <becom33> Im looking for a image upload plugin supported for the latest jquery
[04:03:09] <Noeble> hmm anyone know if its posible to disable/unbind a draggable handler when I move the mouse outside an iframe? I want it to work only inside of it
[04:04:24] <BinaryKitten> axscode so you want the select to only have items > now?
[04:07:10] <axscode> if i have   A B C D E F G as time,    and current time is  D E F G, meaning i already hidden A B C, so i want D to be the new selected time.
[04:07:31] <axscode> ii mean current time is D, meaning i can still selected D E F G.
[04:17:12] <Roey240> some 1 here can help me with jqtouch?
[04:17:36] <BinaryKitten> axscode
[04:17:52] <BinaryKitten> are they meant to be pm?
[04:18:15] <BinaryKitten> ah i see
[04:18:23] * BinaryKitten is in a different timezone
[04:18:29] <BinaryKitten> so the values are not working
[04:23:04] <axscode> it doesnt matter it does not rely on timezone
[04:23:07] <axscode> its not UTC
[04:23:14] <BinaryKitten> no it may not
[04:23:27] <BinaryKitten> but it does hamper my tests as it doesn't work for me
[04:23:27] <axscode> im not using Date.UTC()
[04:23:48] <BinaryKitten> the times are all in the future
[04:25:06] <axscode> ok you can change value of the time on select
[04:25:08] <axscode> options
[04:28:55] <BinaryKitten> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/8c94s/27/
[04:29:07] <BinaryKitten> this has only the items in the future
[04:29:16] <BinaryKitten> no matter what the time of day
[04:29:50] <axscode> what the hell
[04:30:06] <axscode> mine is working already. i just need to set the selected one
[04:30:23] <BinaryKitten> axscode it wasn't working for me at all
[04:30:31] <axscode> look what u did t the time..
[04:30:32] <axscode> 9.25
[04:30:41] <axscode> are u serious?
[04:31:04] <BinaryKitten> ??
[04:31:29] <BinaryKitten> it's not perfect but does work for all times of the day
[04:31:30] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/8c94s/25/ <-- its working well here..
[04:31:50] <BinaryKitten> yes, the outputted values need a little more formatting
[04:32:08] <BinaryKitten> axscode ok .. as i said before that DID not work
[04:32:33] <axscode> anyways nevermind bro. thanks a lot for trying
[04:32:36] <BinaryKitten> it might have worked for you at 7pm your time.. but since it's 12:30pm my time, nothing work
[04:32:42] <axscode> really appreaciate it
[04:32:43] * BinaryKitten aint no bro either
[04:32:50] <axscode> oh sis
[04:33:17] <BinaryKitten> in regards to the 9.25
[04:33:21] <BinaryKitten> that's decimal time
[04:33:46] <axscode> yeah, thanks..
[04:33:47] <BinaryKitten> 9.25 decimal time = 9:15
[04:40:23] <BinaryKitten> what a douche
[04:40:33] <BinaryKitten> i even finished it ... http://jsfiddle.net/8c94s/28/
[04:40:47] <BinaryKitten> now is tidy and outputs correctly
[05:07:55] <aidan> how do I get the index of a node in a list? e.g. if i do $('foo .bar').click(function() { which n'th element was foo .bar in the set foo .bar?
[05:12:27] <aidan> ah, index()
[05:12:37] <aidan> that was easier than I thought
[05:13:08] <BinaryKitten> var collection = $('foo .bar');  collection.click(function() { var idx = collection.index(this); });
[05:13:21] <BinaryKitten> save the double lookup
[05:14:54] <aidan> http://dpaste.com/816230/
[05:15:14] <aidan> does $(this) do another lookup/
[05:15:17] <aidan> ?
[05:15:30] <BinaryKitten> ah no
[05:15:40] <BinaryKitten> i'll look at the past though
[05:17:01] <BinaryKitten> http://dpaste.com/816231/ @ aidan
[05:18:03] <BinaryKitten> no need to pass the largePhotos jQuery collection back to jQuery

[07:58:09] <MasterTroll> assuming the list is a list of <li> tags, did u try just appending to the dom?

[08:23:29] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to target an element loaded by a gmap
[08:23:54] <starsinmypockets> How can I ensure that the gmap is loaded before the jquery is fired?
[08:24:47] <starsinmypockets> I think my jquery is loading before the map is in the dom... it's inside $(document).ready(function () { ('#map-id').ready(function () { //my rules })})
[08:24:59] <starsinmypockets> Bu no worky... it fires on page load
[08:26:49] <xec> starsinmypockets: what is "('#map-id').ready(..." supposed to do?
[08:27:33] <starsinmypockets> xec - it doesn't work. I want the enclosed rules to fire once the map is in the dom
[08:27:36] <xec> Nesh: can't you just add the "see more" thing in that function?
[08:27:51] <Nesh> nope :/
[08:27:55] <xec> starsinmypockets: correct. it doesn't work like that
[08:27:58] <Nesh> Im trying to see for pushing
[08:28:05] <Nesh> new info in the array
[08:28:13] <starsinmypockets> xec - yeah, I can see that - I'm curious how it does work ;)
[08:28:25] <xec> starsinmypockets: you can't (easily) listen for dom changes.
[08:28:59] <starsinmypockets> Also, using 1.3.2
[08:29:00] <xec> starsinmypockets: some script you've written is adding the element with that ID into the dom, right?
[08:29:16] <starsinmypockets> xec: it's drupal views loading a gmap
[08:32:06] <xec> starsinmypockets: i don't know what drupal views (or how it works) unfortunately
[08:32:13] <xec> is*
[08:33:54] <xec> Nesh: sounds like a dirty workaround, but sure, that could work too.
[08:54:06] <gnarf> Nesh: http://jsfiddle.net/brTTd/2/
[08:54:40] <gnarf> Nesh: then you need to work out a way to send a second response with the "more"
[08:58:38] <florence_> anyone knows how to send an id to the server using autocomplete selection
[08:58:39] <gnarf> starsinmypockets: 1.3.2 is so old... Feb 2009

[09:45:27] <black_warlock> nope
[09:45:32] <black_warlock> it should work on both
[09:45:58] <black_warlock> only the css change
[09:46:36] <black_warlock> if the browser used support css3 then will display also effects, or advanced features like radious, and ease in out

[10:58:04] <dakta> ?Dumbledore
[10:58:05] <bot-t> dakta, Couldn't find "Dumbledore" in jQuery Docs.
[10:58:15] <dakta> man, I guess I'm shit out of luck then
[10:58:26] <johnkpaul> dakta: offset is the number of pixels from the top left corner of the document
[10:58:38] <dakta> That was my understanding.
[10:59:08] <dakta> What I want to know is why it's changing.
[10:59:37] <dakta> Could you take a look at this fiddle for me? http://jsfiddle.net/6yBHT/2/
[11:00:24] <dakta> I mean, the object's position isn't changing, but the reported offset value is changing.
[11:04:04] <johnkpaul> dakta: it's because of how animation works
[11:04:19] <johnkpaul> while the scrolling is happening, the fade toggling is also progressing
[11:04:37] <johnkpaul> by the tiime the scroll has finished, there fade toggle has progressed further
[11:04:44] <johnkpaul> so the distance from that element to the top of the doc has inreased
[11:05:43] <dakta> so, if I wrap my code in callbacks all the way through the fadetoggles, it should be fixed?
[11:06:02] <johnkpaul> dakta: "wrap my code in callbacks?
[11:06:18] <johnkpaul> you mean wait until the fadeToggles are finished, before starting the scroll?
[11:06:21] <dakta> I mean, force the scrollTop animation to wait
[11:06:50] <uSMS> I am using jqueryui draggable on my site, how can i tell over which element the draggable has stopped?

[11:08:08] <ryanneufeld> dakta: it
[11:08:13] <ryanneufeld> is a bit of a mind fuck
[11:08:39] <johnkpaul> :) yeah, but you get used to it
[11:08:45] <johnkpaul> it's a js thing, not a jquery thing
[11:09:40] <dakta> Based on how my code is structured, would I be best off putting the callback call in toggle_jobs_display() inside both fadeToggle callbacks, or should I do something else to wait for the fadeToggles to complete?
[11:10:38] <johnkpaul> dakta: have you ever used $.Deferred?
[11:10:44] <johnkpaul> one second, will work on a example
[11:11:13] <ryanneufeld> yes, a deferred/promise would be great for this
[11:11:46] <johnkpaul> dakta: http://jsfiddle.net/6yBHT/3/
[11:11:47] <dakta> Excellent!
[11:12:01] <johnkpaul> dakta: not a big change in code,but large concept to understand
[11:12:09] <johnkpaul> read through the defrred docs to get more
[11:12:11] <johnkpaul> ?deferred @dakta
[11:12:11] <bot-t> dakta, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[11:12:36] <uSMS> I am using jqueryui draggable on my site, how can i tell over which element the draggable has stopped? right now I'm using offset and a ridiculous grid of coordinates to decide where it went. there's got to be a better way
[11:13:53] <Lagger> uSMS look into droppable
[11:14:00] <dakta> johnkpaul: I am pretty sure I understand the concept, it's just the whole non-blocking thing
[11:14:27] <ryanneufeld> dakta: http://confreaks.com/videos/993-jqcon2012-i-promise-to-show-you-when-to-use-deferreds
[11:14:31] <ryanneufeld> watch that
[11:14:43] <ryanneufeld> I saw Alex give his talk in SF
[11:14:53] <ryanneufeld> was very well done
[11:15:03] <Lagger> http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[11:15:11] <dakta> damn, I live near SF
[11:15:18] <uSMS> wow how have I missed droppable all this time
[11:17:30] <dakta> johnkpaul: Well, whaddya know, deffereds solved my problem nicely.
[11:17:41] <johnkpaul> dakta: :) great
[11:17:47] <dakta> johnkpaul, ryanneufeld Thanks
[11:17:56] <johnkpaul> np, have fun dakta
[11:19:42] <Lagger> what is the best server side language for web dev?
[11:25:51] <twisted`> hi, I'm working on a project that has a lot of jQuery stuff going on
[11:26:05] <twisted`> I have 2 pages that do roughly the same, on one page it works without any problems
[11:26:15] <twisted`> second page, same mechanisms it throws errors that don't make any sense to me
[11:26:40] <twisted`> I get on the second one: Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [value=Option waehlen...]
[11:27:03] <twisted`> oddly enough, cause I wanted to know where it's being caused, if I swap out jQuery 1.6.1 minified with the dev version
[11:27:09] <twisted`> the original page doesn't work anymore
[11:27:11] <twisted`> any tips?
[11:29:14] <intellilogic> Google the changes?  I'd honestly rewrite it for the most modern jQuery, but that's just me
[11:30:31] <intellilogic> <div class='count'>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</div>   .count ... click    What would be the best way to go about knowing what star was click assuming they are 1-10 left to right?  Counting the items before it, but using what function?  Suggestions anyone?
[11:31:19] <twisted`> I think I discovered what's up but that would be so shitty if that's true :p
[11:33:03] <intellilogic> twisted` it's always something shitty simple and stupid and then you go *face palm*
[11:33:24] <twisted`> well it seems that it might have to do with the attributes that have a illogical numbering
[11:33:35] <twisted`> gotta check internally in the shop if I can change those so they make more *sense*
[11:33:42] <intellilogic> freeking last night I was testing a query and filled in the data by hand quickly, not thinking and the query failed, was looking for syntax error, I'd made 20 as the month and mysql didn't like that...  LOL
[11:35:35] <twisted`> meh this is a project that has probably seen 4 different development agencies
[11:35:42] <twisted`> and now it lands on my desk, no docs, no specs
[11:35:43] <twisted`> nothing
[11:35:47] <twisted`> just broken pos
[11:38:10] <Lagger> twisted loop through and get index
[11:38:52] <Lagger> errr intellilogic
[11:40:37] <intellilogic> index of?  I also realize I have another problem as I want to use 2 types of stars
[11:40:46] <intellilogic> â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†
[11:41:12] <Lagger> $('.star').each(function(index)){
[11:42:08] <Lagger> brb ill example
[11:42:18] <florence_> i need to pass the id of my selected item in the autocomplete input once i submit my form.. any ideas?
[11:43:03] <rmurphey> florence_: have you posted a demo of what you're trying to do?
[11:43:16] <rmurphey> i know you've asked the same question repeatedly
[11:44:02] <rmurphey> if you can post a demo with jsfiddle, it's more likely that people can help you
[11:45:56] <Lagger> http://jsfiddle.net/q8R8n/

[11:48:00] <Guest1443> Hi there! I just can't seem to select spans according to their text I tried $('span[text()="foo"]') which unfortunately just gives me the same as $('span'). Any help is greatly appreciated!
[11:48:26] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: see ?selectors
[11:48:26] <bot-t> Guest1443, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[11:52:42] <Guest1443> ryanneufeld: Thank you very much...but didn't I use the 'Attribute equals Selector' already?
[11:53:17] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: is text() a valid attribute?
[11:53:29] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: there is no way to select based on the content of a tag
[11:53:34] <ryanneufeld> only it's attributes
[11:53:46] <ryanneufeld> so if you're trying to select <span>foo</span>
[11:53:52] <ryanneufeld> you're out of luck
[11:54:11] <ryanneufeld> what you *can* do though is use ?each
[11:54:11] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:54:19] <ryanneufeld> rather ?map
[11:54:22] <intellilogic> Lagger: my stars aren't marked in any markup, making it tricky...
[11:54:41] <florence_> =/
[11:54:45] <Guest1443> ryanneufeld: To be precise...I want to select spans that have a certain class but NO text.  $('span.some_class[text=""]') fails
[11:54:47] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: you can use the span selector and ?map
[11:55:19] <intellilogic> Lagger:  $(this).index() is pulling the 2 upper spans :-/    am I going to have to wrap them in something?  They are just text characters essentually
[11:55:23] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: you can use the span selector and http://api.jquery.com/map/
[11:55:36] <ryanneufeld> damn you bot-t
[11:56:02] <ryanneufeld> Guest1443: then, you can check $(this).text() === '';
[12:02:18] <Guest1443> ryanneufeld: Thank you very, very much. That actually worked just fine!
[12:02:30] <ryanneufeld> No worries!
[12:03:00] <redlegoreng> hi ! i'm looking for a clean way to send multiple ajax queries at once, each with its own callback, to be sure they are trated at the same time by the server
[12:03:10] <redlegoreng> is there a way to do this with jquery ?
[12:03:16] <florence_> rmurphey:  any ideas?
[12:03:30] <rmurphey> florence_: i'm still not clear on what your problem is
[12:03:38] <rmurphey> what is happening, and what do you want to happen?
[12:04:22] <Lagger> intellilogic send me jsfiddle of your progress
[12:04:39] <florence_> rmurphey:  i want to use my query instead of that items as u can see in the jsfiddle
[12:05:19] <apdmatos> redlegoreng what do you mean? with http you don't have message order guarantee
[12:05:36] <rmurphey> florence_: i am afraid i do not understand
[12:06:31] <redlegoreng> apdmatos, i'm looking for a good way to achieve order guarantee but without having to wait each answer... I was thining of sending an array with each api call, but then I don't know how to manage the callbacks
[12:06:40] <florence_> rmurphey:  that i want to bring results from the server and add the id to server
[12:07:01] <redlegoreng> apdmatos, i thought there'd be a common pattern to do this
[12:07:33] <apdmatos> if the order is important, send a single request with all the information
[12:07:35] <Lagger> i would just wrap them in spans though
[12:07:43] <Lagger> or list or w/e
[12:07:48] <rmurphey> redlegoreng: see deferreds and $.when
[12:08:24] <rmurphey> $.when lets you bind to the resolution of multiple async operations, and respond to them in order
[12:08:31] <apdmatos> I don't know your use case, but with http you don't have guarantees with the message order
[12:09:22] <rmurphey> $.when( req1, req2, req3 ).done(function(resp1, resp2, resp3) { ... });
[12:09:55] <apdmatos> rmurphey: he wants to send multiple ajax requests to his server, and process them in order. I think he cannot archive it with $.when
[12:10:27] <apdmatos> *achieve
[12:10:27] <rmurphey> apdmatos: ah, process them on the server in order?
[12:10:45] <rmurphey> jquery will be of little help with that :)
[12:11:03] <apdmatos> rmurphey: that was what i understood
[12:11:05] <redlegoreng> ok, i'll look at that. the typical case is the following : I send "addPost". After that, I'd like to reload the thread (to update postCount). So I send "getThread/id". I'd like to do those at once. I'd also like to have two different calls (insteand of having updatePost returning the thread) so my API remains clear
[12:11:53] <redlegoreng> the easy way would of course to wait for the answer of addPost before sending getThread, but that's doubling the lag
[12:13:20] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[12:13:21] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/
[12:13:57] <apdmatos> if you do not wait for addPost complete, you can the thread and the post is not there yet
[12:14:06] <apdmatos> so I see two ways
[12:14:09] <gnarf> redlegoreng: you need to chain the callbacks
[12:14:16] <apdmatos> wait for addPost request complets
[12:14:23] <gnarf> like addPost().done( updatePosts );
[12:14:54] <apdmatos> or send a request to addPost and add the post to your page with javascript
[12:15:09] <gnarf> aka "fake it"
[12:15:14] <gnarf> thats always a good choice
[12:16:27] <apdmatos> in the first alternative, you can use callback chain that gnarf suggested
[12:16:32] <gnarf> and ryanneufeld were you maybe looking to use ?filter instead ?
[12:16:59] <redlegoreng> but the callback chain needs to wait for the first answer before sending the second query, no ?
[12:17:08] <apdmatos> yep
[12:17:15] <gnarf> redlegoreng: thats the idea
[12:17:15] <apdmatos> jquery does it by default
[12:17:16] <redlegoreng> well that's what i dont want
[12:17:26] <redlegoreng> let's say i have a 500ms ping
[12:17:33] <gnarf> redlegoreng: if you want to make sure the addPost has finished, thats EXACTLY what you want
[12:17:39] <redlegoreng> no !!!
[12:17:47] <redlegoreng> i need to execute the query in an order
[12:17:55] <gnarf> otherwise, "fake it" -- pretend that the data was actually submitted and update your display
[12:18:04] <redlegoreng> well you don't listen...
[12:18:33] <FrameFever> How can I drag an element, even when the mouse cursor is outside the window?
[12:18:36] <gnarf> redlegoreng: yes, I do -- your server side is going to suffer greatly if you want to make sure it only parses "serial" operations...
[12:19:18] <gnarf> redlegoreng: its actually silly to ask your server to "wait" for another request to finish - it's going to waste so many open connections "waiting", etc
[12:19:32] <gnarf> the "proper" way to do that is when you get the response from addPost, you send the next two queries you want
[12:19:46] <redlegoreng> you don't listen : there would be only ONE ajax call that would wrap both queries
[12:20:27] <gnarf> so you are talking about another API endpoint, or converting the addPost to return the other?
[12:20:29] <gnarf> and wtf
[12:21:02] <FrameFever> anybody?
[12:21:43] <gnarf> FrameFever: once the mouse leaves the "window" you don't get any mouse events -- you might be able to use the html5 draggable api to give a "real" representation of the draggable data
[12:21:44] <redlegoreng> I'd like to have two different queries (instead of having updatePost returning the same as getThread) so my API remains clear
[12:21:57] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: maybe...
[12:21:59] <gnarf> redlegoreng: that sounds like two different ajax requests to me
[12:22:10] <FrameFever> gnarf: http://jsbin.com/ifuma#noedit
[12:22:35] <FrameFever> I don't understand how it is done here
[12:22:41] <gnarf> redlegoreng: so, which is it, one ajax request that does all magic, or multiple ajax requests executed in serial order to ensure each completes before the previous runs
[12:23:17] <redlegoreng> one ajax request that wraps two "methods" or "queries" or "actions" (or whatever you name this)
[12:23:44] <redlegoreng> and two callbacks
[12:23:53] <redlegoreng> one for "addPost" and one for "updateThread"
[12:24:38] <gnarf> redlegoreng: so, you want an "addPostAndUpdateThread" that returns { "addPost": ..., "updateThread": ... }
[12:24:45] <_bart> Does anyone know of a 3D countdown plugin (using CSS3)? I want to create that apple-like date countdown, by flipping the second numbers
[12:25:03] <gnarf> then handle splitting the "result" into "two callbacks" in your "done" function on that request
[12:25:28] <redlegoreng> yes, but i'd like to do that with any two or more "actions"
[12:25:39] <redlegoreng> let's say i want to addPost and then getUser
[12:25:54] <gnarf> redlegoreng: same formula, maybe change it out to be an array of "results"
[12:26:02] <gnarf> rather than a "named object"
[12:26:22] <gnarf> just use [ addPostResult, getUserResult ] as your "output format"
[12:26:43] <gnarf> then write a little helper function to get each part for the callbacks
[12:27:22] <_bart> ah cool: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/17/pfold-paper-like-unfolding-effect/
[12:27:56] <redlegoreng> ok, but there is no existing pattern/architecture to do this ?
[12:29:30] <tipdbmp> If I have two .css files with the same classes/properties defiend but with different values can I just switch between them dynamically or do I need to rerender the page with the switched .css file?
[12:31:11] <gnarf> redlegoreng: not really - most people just make successive api calls
[12:31:16] <redlegoreng> ok
[12:31:42] <gnarf> redlegoreng: i mean, reducing requests is cool, but if it makes it more complex its value is usually not worth it
[12:31:42] <redlegoreng> thanks for your hep
[12:31:44] <redlegoreng> help
[12:31:54] <redlegoreng> well it depends
[12:32:13] <redlegoreng> with a mobilephone, for instance, a request can take quite some time
[12:32:40] <redlegoreng> often more than 1 or 2 seconds
[12:33:05] <redlegoreng> then, if you do two chained requests instead of two wrapped request, you get a response time of 4 seconds or more
[12:33:09] <redlegoreng> which begins to be annoying
[12:33:13] <gnarf> yeah, thats why you make your API return all the useful data you need
[12:33:26] <redlegoreng> yes but then you API becomes too specific
[12:34:02] <gnarf> also, on mobiles - the "fake it" approach is worth it too
[12:34:04] <redlegoreng> and the day you develop a desktop or intranet applicatin for the same API, you don't get why the "addCard" method returns a thread
[12:34:16] <redlegoreng> yes but then you have to develop the logic twice
[12:34:22] <gnarf> redlegoreng: makes sense in those locations too as well
[12:34:33] <redlegoreng> and even exposing some maybe private internal logic
[12:34:43] <gnarf> redlegoreng: if addCard gives you the thread it was added to, the response makes sense
[12:35:01] <gnarf> saves you time on the desk/intra site as well
[12:35:17] <redlegoreng> well it makes only sense if well documented... Why wouldn't it respond the user's post counts ?
[12:35:22] <redlegoreng> il really depends on what you need
[12:35:39] <gnarf> thats why you add options to the returned data format then
[12:35:40] <redlegoreng> the API shouldn't be dependant of the client side program
[12:36:20] <gnarf> redlegoreng: you talk to me like I haven't experienced these things, I've been writing web apps for 15 years now
[12:36:20] <redlegoreng> so you do "addPost(returnGetThread)" which is about what i was suggesting but way more ugly
[12:37:01] <gnarf> mostly database driven / heavy api sites
[12:37:18] <HarryPitfall> lol... one of my 'always coded' lines here is... $('a[href=#
[12:37:26] <HarryPitfall> ops, sorry, wrong place
[12:37:43] <HarryPitfall> damn windows...
[12:38:14] <redlegoreng> gnarf, I don't mean to be rude at all, I'm just trying to learn about the best way to do it. Of course the case (as every case) is specific and that's why I don't want to simply chain queries
[12:38:30] <gnarf> I understand the design principles of API - I'm telling you, you can almost always avoid the "followup requests" by requesting extra data with parameters to the api
[12:38:41] <gnarf> sometimes tho
[12:38:52] <gnarf> you need a generic way to do like 3 queries
[12:39:20] <redlegoreng> yes, 3 or maybe more one day
[12:39:46] <gnarf> then you just provide an endpoint to "aggregate" the queries on the api itself, or you deal with the problem with a higher level / more "recursive" api call
[12:40:26] <redlegoreng> yes i'll try do go that way
[12:40:45] <redlegoreng> i was just thinking that a pattern or something woud already exist
[12:40:48] <gnarf> you might end up running into issues with max length of get requests, etc
[12:41:18] <gnarf> but a "batch API" isn't unheard of -- I just had to write one for something I was doing
[12:42:17] <redlegoreng> "batch API" : exactly :)
[12:43:25] <eizdealer> hey guys, i wonder if the internationalization of the datepicker is broken? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization always displays everything in english for me...
[12:44:17] <ryanneufeld> eizdealer: sounds like you have found a bug!
[12:44:31] <eizdealer> oh noez
[12:44:32] <eizdealer> ^^
[12:44:49] <eizdealer> i wish i hadn't
[12:45:32] <redlegoreng> thx gnarf
[12:45:41] <ryanneufeld> eizdealer: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8005
[12:46:00] <redlegoreng> i'll try to do something with that
[12:46:07] <eizdealer> lol ok thx
[12:46:54] <adam007> can i ask jqgrid in here ?
[12:47:14] <kvikende> hai. i got a stupid question i think. i have created a button in html as a link: <a id="mybutton" href="javascript:myJavascript()" data-role="button">REPLACEMENT_TEXT</a> and now i want from my code to change replacement_text to something sensible, but what happens is that the button shrinks and looks ugly when i use $('#mybutton').text("Sensible text"); :(
[12:47:32] <ryanneufeld> ah, eizdealer I'm gonna go poke someone about that. Good find.
[12:47:45] <eizdealer> thx ryanneufeld!
[12:47:49] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @adam007
[12:47:49] <bot-t> adam007, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:48:21] <kvikende> oh, and adding .button('refresh') doesnt work because its not initialized
[12:49:55] <eizdealer> ryanneufeld: i'm confusedâ€¦ $( selector ).datepicker( $.datepicker.regional[ "fr" ] ); doesn't work for me either
[12:50:11] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:50:20] <ryanneufeld> file a bug at bugs.jqueryui.com :)
[12:50:57] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: is it an issue with the demo or the code?
[12:51:13] <ryanneufeld> seems that he's having issues with it locally as well
[12:51:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna try and repro with a fiddle
[12:52:22] <ltr20> Whats wrong with this code? http://pastie.org/5094841 - getting "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation "
[12:54:56] <ryanneufeld> ltr20: look carefully at line 2
[12:55:01] <ryanneufeld> check your quotes
[12:57:58] <ltr20> ryanneufeld, whats the issue?
[12:58:14] <ryanneufeld> ltr20: Look. At. Your. Quotes.
[12:58:16] <Visigoth_> <div class="box-front"></div>
[12:58:20] <Visigoth_> put that right before box
[12:58:31] <ryanneufeld> Visigoth_: ?
[12:59:02] <guy> how to prevent jquery-ui draggable element from being dragged without unsetting the event? e.g. http://jsbin.com/ufarif/3/edit I want to restrict element from moving to the left more than 100px. (I am aware about the containment option, though the condition is dynamic)
[12:59:06] <ryanneufeld> eizdealer: see http://jsfiddle.net/wRD5N/1/ c/o gnarf
[12:59:34] <ryanneufeld> eizdealer: you need to include the language file https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/master/ui/i18n/jquery.ui.datepicker-no.js
[12:59:39] <ltr20> ryanneufeld, is there a specific issue with the quotes? Not sure i'm following
[13:00:01] <ryanneufeld> ltr20: '<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'
[13:00:08] <ryanneufeld> you don't see the problem with that?
[13:01:01] <kickandrew> ltr20: you'll need to echo bloginfo('url') as well
[13:01:17] <ltr20> should i be using double quotes? The final output looks like - 'url' : 'http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php',
[13:01:21] <ryanneufeld> '<?php echo bloginfo('url'); ?>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'

[13:11:20] <guy> how to prevent jquery-ui draggable element from being dragged without unsetting the event? e.g. http://jsbin.com/ufarif/3/edit I want to restrict element from moving to the left more than 100px. (I am aware about the containment option, though the condition is dynamic)
[13:13:33] <vieuxmike> hi i have got a problem while using jQuery.get with a webservice, in my FF console I can see "200 OK" but it's always in error(...) which happens
[13:13:48] <vieuxmike> and i don't have a xhr.responseText grrrr
[13:19:59] <ltr20> ryanneufeld, thanks for your help... took the time to debug this properly and it was because i forgot to attach .val() on the postalcode input
[13:20:12] <guy> well, I put my question up here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13001787/how-to-lock-freeze-temporary-disable-jquery-ui-draggable-event
[13:20:14] <ltr20> will use the link you provided, thx for your help
[13:20:19] <ryanneufeld> ltr20: cool
[13:20:42] <ryanneufeld> vieuxmike: see ?sop
[13:20:43] <bot-t> vieuxmike, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[13:21:28] <vieuxmike> thanks ryanneufeld
[13:22:07] <vieuxmike> and there is no way to avoid this problem with an other domain name ?
[13:22:33] <kickandrew> unless you proxy the request
[13:22:40] <kickandrew> server-side
[13:23:11] <vieuxmike> by calling my own script and calls the webservice from PHP rather than javascript ?
[13:25:50] <kickandrew> yes
[13:27:09] <kickandrew> There a lot of convenience rest client libraries out there that all for fairly effortless request capabilities for external webservices with minimal effort.
[13:29:31] <kickandrew> vieuxmike: http://phphttpclient.com/ for example, although you might want to ask around in #php
[13:47:09] <kopf> I'm using https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload to do drag-n-drop file uploads (dragging a file off your desktop into the browser window, etc). Does anyone know if there's any way, using this library, jQuery or pure javascript, to detect when a file is being dragged over the window? (I'd like to display some sort of visual indication, like is done on imgur.com, when a file is dragged over the window)
[13:50:35] <ryanneufeld> kickandrew, vieuxmike you can also us ?jsonp
[13:50:42] <ryanneufeld> if the server supports it
[13:57:20] <FrameFever> is there something like capture mouse for jquery?
[14:00:30] <guy> mousemove?
[14:01:05] <guy> like to take over control of the mouse? no. you could hide the cursor and animate a fake cursor, though.
[14:03:39] <FrameFever> guy: no I want to get the mousemove event, even when the mousecursor is outside the  browser
[14:03:57] <guy> That's not possible either (using javascript at least.)
[14:04:19] <FrameFever> with FF and IE you can call setCapture
[14:04:33] <FrameFever> then it works
[14:04:40] <FrameFever> but maybe there is eomthing from jquery
[14:04:45] <kickandrew> kopf: you can bind the element to the "dragenter" event.
[14:04:57] <kickandrew> the element being the div that you'd want to be able to drag the file into
[14:07:52] <guy> what... you are telling me there is a way to track mouse movement outside browser window?
[14:12:02] <FrameFever> guy: sure man
[14:12:13] <FrameFever> guy: run this http://jsbin.com/ifuma#noedit
[14:12:54] <guy> Thank you for pointing out. I wonder how could this be put into a use.
[14:13:34] <guy> localStorage + this = dragging element from one screen to another in real time.
[14:13:45] <guy> some social media freak, maybe.
[14:14:37] <FrameFever> guy: I use it for a slider
[14:14:49] <guy> oh, yeah. obviously.
[14:15:26] <guy> I love how bugs become features.
[14:15:36] <FrameFever> guy: ?
[14:15:45] <guy> FrameFever: That's not about the cursor movement.
[14:15:51] <FrameFever> this is no bug
[14:15:55] <guy> ryanneufeld: https://dev.anuary.com/c5e22f1a-e772-5ad6-afff-9202af28e644/
[14:16:23] <guy> I left a bug in the infinite drag, though it turned out to be a nice UX feature. : )
[14:16:39] <guy> (if you drag far enough, you will see the two freaky characters from the movie)
[14:18:53] <FrameFever> guy: It don't drag the mouse movement outside the browser
[14:20:33] <ryanneufeld> guy: neat
[14:20:44] <kickandrew> kopf: http://jsfiddle.net/wQrDY/
[14:21:29] <kickandrew> stupid example, but just showing you the event binding
[14:26:15] <deweydb> hello
[14:27:14] <deweydb> i'm having some trouble with a jquery plugin called flexslider and a responsive design.  If the page load starts big, and is resized smaller it all works fine. but if the page starts small and is resized bigger the slider doesn't get bigger, just the space it is in and the images double up. see: http://cux.waspdigital.com/case-study/warner-brothers
[14:27:57] <kobra> fluid width layout
[14:29:37] <kobra> alright, if someone can help me, i have used this code http://pastebin.com/3THYpmLY to hightlight the menu items on http://whistlersfishandchips.co.uk/wordpress/ but the removeclass doesn't seem to be working, whats wrong?
[14:30:03] <kopf> kickandrew: nice one, thanks
[14:30:07] <deweydb> you have two ss in this
[14:30:34] <kobra> You can access the clicked element using "thiss." or "jQuery(thiss)"
[14:31:15] <kobra> it is declared thats why
[14:31:31] <kobra> dew: its a wordpress plugin Ajax Page Loader
[14:32:03] <deweydb> this one?
[14:32:04] <deweydb> http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-ajax-page-loader/
[14:32:13] <kobra> yea
[14:33:03] <deweydb> dunno
[14:34:04] <kickandrew> deweydb: maybe an alternative plugin would be a good option?  Even the demo page @ woothemes doesn't work very well...
[14:35:12] <kickandrew> lots of wonkiness on resize for me.
[14:35:19] <deweydb> what browser?
[14:35:37] <kickandrew> Chrome V. 22.0.1229.94 OSX
[14:36:03] <deweydb> strange i don't get any wonkyness in the same browser on their demo
[14:36:12] <deweydb> but yeah. maybe i should find another plugin
[14:36:59] <kickandrew> super strange!  I resized and when I went from small to large, the images didn't resize properly.
[14:37:12] <deweydb> ahhh
[14:37:33] <deweydb> right
[14:37:33] <deweydb> yeah
[14:37:48] <deweydb> thwat was what was funky on my implementation of their plugin
[14:37:52] <deweydb> i guess you're right it is just buggy
[14:38:10] <kickandrew> I PMd you a link
[14:38:18] <kickandrew> http://marktyrrell.com/labs/blueberry/ looks good.
[14:42:54] <deweydb> kickandrew: thanks! that fixed it
[14:43:06] <deweydb> fuck this is why i usually write stuff like that myself
[14:43:32] <deweydb> everytime i use one of these jquery plugins i end up getting stuck on it for hours
[14:43:37] <deweydb> because of some bug in its code
[14:44:22] <kobra> jquery wordpress plugin?
[14:45:07] <deweydb> damm that flexslider worked a lot better on mobile though
[14:45:18] <deweydb> it supported swipe and all that jazz
[14:45:54] <Tom______> Hello, I'd like to use .on() with mouseenter/leave but as I used to with live, what's the syntax for that?
[14:47:29] <kickandrew> Tom______:  $(element).on('mouseenter', function(){ alert('doingsomething'); });
[14:48:44] <Tom______> kickandrew: I tried that, it's a dynamically added element, so it doesn't pick it up.
[14:48:52] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[14:49:08] <deweydb> kickandrew: went back to flexslider. found my problem too, was overthinking it. didn't need to specify a width parameter at all
[14:49:22] <shoky> Tom______:  $(selector).live(type, function) === $(document).on(type, selector, function)
[14:49:44] <sebfz1> Hi, question about jQuery UI 1.9. Seems that ui.options.active is not avalaible anymore in accordion :s what can replace it ?
[14:50:17] <Tom______> shoky: Ah, so the selector needs declaring after the type. I see.
[14:53:48] <Tom______> shoky: Thanks, worked a charm.
[14:57:15] <sebfz1> nobody about my accordion ?
[15:01:44] <Tom______> sebfz1: Looks like it's still there according to the documentation. http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[15:04:22] <sebfz1> Hi Tom, thanks a lot. Seems that the browser and my firebug do not agree with that... I am still investigating...
[15:05:49] <emr> Hi, i have select box, multiple, and trying to select elements with jquery, how i can perform?
[15:07:21] <sebfz1> on event beforeActivate & activate, 'options' are not an object of 'ui' anymore... don't know where it gone..
[15:08:04] <Tom______> emr: .attr('selected', true);
[15:08:48] <emr> well Tom______ , its working but if i select multiple elements in loop only selects last element
[15:35:32] <skypce> hello guys, how can i show a menu when hover over top region of a page?
[15:35:35] <skypce> i have this
[15:35:36] <skypce> $("nav").hover(
[15:35:37] <skypce>   function () {
[15:35:37] <skypce>     $(this).addClass("hover");
[15:35:37] <skypce>   },
[15:35:37] <skypce>   function () {
[15:35:38] <skypce>     $(this).removeClass("hover");
[15:35:40] <skypce>   }
[15:35:42] <skypce> );
[15:35:44] <skypce> and in hover class : visibility:visible
[15:40:25] <xec> skypce: a hidden div won't trigger any mouseover (hover) events
[15:41:04] <skypce> ok thank you
[15:41:08] <xec> skypce: so add/remove the class on what you want to hide, instead of what you're attaching the .hover() to
[15:41:47] <skypce> how can i do it?xec
[15:42:10] <xec> skypce: it really depends on your html structure
[15:45:09] <xec> skypce: essentially, avoid hiding the element that you have the show method attached to ;)
[15:45:40] <skypce> ok thank you xec
[15:47:11] <rmurphey> skypce: http://jsfiddle.net/wyAVY/
[15:48:20] <xec> or even better, just use css http://jsfiddle.net/wyAVY/1/
[15:48:52] <rmurphey> :)
[15:49:29] <skypce> very thank you rmurphey
[15:51:23] <rmurphey> skypce: please do not PM
[15:52:13] <xec> ... but if you absolutely positively HAVE to PM, make sure to PM rmurphey :D
[15:52:34] <xec> sorry, i'm bored. and tired.
[15:52:41] <xec> i should go to bed :P
[15:54:15] <skypce> how can i know if jquery core is working?
[16:15:01] <mikeumus> Howdy. Had a quick question about the way to call multiple functions off one selection.
[16:15:10] <mikeumus> For example: $('#box1copy').function(){ this.click(); this.done(); }
[16:15:50] <mikeumus> so that I don't have to keep using $('#box1copy') on every line.
[16:16:28] <mikeumus> just seems like there is a smarter way to do it.
[16:17:56] <razzi> mikeumus can you be a bit more clear?
[16:18:21] <mikeumus> yeah
[16:19:37] <mikeumus> is there a technique for calling multiple functions from a single selection. For example $('div).function(){ this.click(); this.done();}
[16:19:38] <mikeumus> versus
[16:19:51] <mikeumus> having to call the selector twice like this:
[16:20:17] <mikeumus> $('div').click(); $('div').done();
[16:20:29] <razzi> yeah, $(this)
[16:21:01] <razzi> or
[16:21:15] <mikeumus> so it starts off like this then?:     $('div).function(){ $(this).click()};
[16:21:19] <razzi> perhaps you mean this: $('div').click().done();
[16:21:29] <razzi> it's called chaining
[16:21:30] <mikeumus> hum
[16:22:17] <mikeumus> can you chain with new lines?
[16:22:21] <mikeumus> line breaks in the code?
[16:22:37] <razzi> yeah sure
[16:22:44] <mikeumus> interesting
[16:23:06] <mikeumus> alright cool
[16:23:20] <mikeumus> thanks razzi
[16:23:33] <mikeumus> I'll give it a shot
[16:24:24] <skypce> hello
[16:24:36] <skypce> can you help me please: http://www.r8.cl/victor
[16:24:55] <skypce> i need show and hide menu bar with hover event
[16:28:03] <rmurphey> skypce: you should have your code in a document ready wrapper
[16:28:36] <skypce> $('nav').hover(function() {
[16:28:36] <skypce>     $(this).toggleClass('hover');
[16:28:36] <skypce> });
[16:28:55] <rmurphey> yes, that needs to be inside $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[16:29:00] <rmurphey> also your css is not accurate
[16:29:06] <skypce> :D
[16:29:14] <skypce> very thank you rmurphey
[16:29:40] <rmurphey> nav .hover is different from nav.hover
[16:30:01] <rmurphey> if you are adding the hover class to the nav, your css needs to be applied to nav.hover #top
[16:30:43] <skypce> ok very thank you rmurphey
[16:30:51] <myrman> If you want to skip the javascript just use this style:
[16:30:51] <myrman> nav:hover #top {
[16:30:51] <myrman> display: block;
[16:30:51] <myrman> }
[16:32:02] <myrman> Simpler and doesn't depend on js being available
[16:32:23] <skypce> nav:hover #top {
[16:32:23] <skypce>     display: block;
[16:32:23] <skypce> }
[16:32:25] <skypce> doesnt work
[16:32:27] <skypce> :S
[16:33:33] <myrman> I just tested it and it works. Did you modify it at all?
[16:34:38] <skypce> yes it is work
[16:34:38] <skypce> :D
[16:34:39] <skypce> sorry
[16:34:42] <skypce> very thank you
[16:34:49] <myrman> You're welcome :)
[16:35:26] <myrman> Don't forget to remove the JavaScript, skypce
[16:35:34] <myrman> Unless you still need it for something.
[16:36:47] <skypce> thank you myrman :D
[16:37:30] <skypce> myrman, it is much complicated add a fade in and fade out?
[16:37:39] <skypce> i will answer in google :D
[16:39:10] <skypce> myrman if you need help with something in drupal theming i can help you :D
[16:39:44] <myrman> I'll be alright, but thank you for the generous offer
[16:43:56] <myrman> Still there skypce?
[16:44:16] <skypce> hello
[16:44:17] <skypce> yes
[16:44:28] <skypce> i am searching transitions in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331353/transitions-on-the-display-property
[16:45:25] <myrman> You can try this code, skypce http://p.thomasmyrman.com/508488bf288a9
[16:46:31] <myrman> You will need to replace the current selectors
[16:48:11] <myrman> Also, check out this article to ensure that the opacity works cross-browser: http://css-tricks.com/css-transparency-settings-for-all-broswers/
[16:49:59] <skypce> very very thank you myrman i am in dubt with you ;P
[16:50:49] <black_warlock> any pro with jq-ui ?
[16:51:23] <black_warlock> how can i open a menu on mouseover
[16:51:36] <black_warlock> and only when drag and drop it active
[16:51:38] <myrman> Don't worry about it skypce. Check out #css, it's a better channel for your questions
[16:51:53] <skypce> ok :D
[16:52:00] <skypce> that have a nice day :D
[17:10:43] <diverdude> Whats the difference between .html('').append(img) and .html(img)  ?
[17:14:05] <black_warlock> .append = postpone img
[17:14:23] <black_warlock> .html = replace the html content of a tag
[17:14:35] <black_warlock> are 2 different things
[17:14:44] <black_warlock> .append goes with .prepend
[17:15:00] <black_warlock> if you have a div
[17:15:28] <black_warlock> .append  <div></div>img <<<<<put yout content here
[17:15:59] <black_warlock> .html(img) <div>img</div>  put content inside div
[17:16:38] <black_warlock> .prepend   img<div></div>
[17:17:22] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys! I have http://pastebin.com/asURn8e0 , what should I put in the specified part if I want to change the image that is at the beginning?
[17:17:32] <black_warlock> understand diverdude ?
[17:17:48] <diverdude> black_warlock: ahh sry didnt see you wrote
[17:19:01] <diverdude> black_warlock: i see..so ELM.html('').append(img) clears the content of ELM and then adds img inside ELM afterwards?
[17:19:32] <black_warlock> yep
[17:19:51] <diverdude> thx
[17:19:58] <black_warlock> .html('') empty the tag
[17:20:21] <diverdude> black_warlock: so same as ELM.remove().append(img); ?
[17:20:29] <black_warlock> no
[17:20:39] <black_warlock> that remove tag
[17:20:43] <JoseeAntonioR> anyone has an idea of ^ ?
[17:20:55] <black_warlock> if you have a div with class ELM
[17:21:21] <black_warlock> <div class="elm"> content html </div> img afterwords
[17:21:33] <black_warlock> if you put remove elm
[17:21:41] <HarryPitfall> .html('') ?
[17:21:56] <HarryPitfall> why not just... ELM.empty().append(img);
[17:21:58] <black_warlock> you will not be able to put append()
[17:22:08] <black_warlock> because tag is removed
[17:23:08] <black_warlock> .empty sound good
[17:24:00] <black_warlock> but you cant .remove elm or will not .append
[17:24:06] <black_warlock> the img
[17:24:26] <black_warlock> diverdude
[17:25:02] <diverdude> ahhh i see
[17:25:20] <diverdude> but empty does not remove the ELM tag, just the children. no?
[17:25:28] <black_warlock> the content
[17:25:44] <sha1sum> Anyone run into an issue with jqplot not rendering a chart inside of a JQM collapsible set?
[17:25:47] <black_warlock> its exactly like .html('')
[17:25:50] <diverdude> yeah so you can do ELM.empty().append(img)
[17:25:51] <sha1sum> It renders fine outside of the set
[17:26:06] <sha1sum> (and the div wrapping it is there)
[17:26:06] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/c5e22f1a-e772-5ad6-afff-9202af28e644/ any idea why the end element (5th) cannot be dropped on the 1st one? using jquery ui sortable.
[17:26:16] <black_warlock> yes diverdude
[17:26:24] <diverdude> thx
[17:27:47] <black_warlock> the element number 5 its dropble
[17:28:42] <black_warlock> and i can drop it on the 1st element
[17:29:59] <black_warlock> wtf are you tring to do ?
[17:30:06] <black_warlock> guy ?

[17:39:19] <Visigoth_> im drunk as fuck dude
[17:39:20] <buu> Unless you meant the literal language pearl
[17:39:23] <Visigoth_> and that was back in the 90s
[17:39:31] <Visigoth_> know misstype
[17:39:31] <buu> Visigoth_: Things have changed slightly =]
[17:39:42] <adyeah> tried node.js?
[17:39:56] <Visigoth_> im in that irc right now bugging the hell out of them
[17:40:00] <Visigoth_> :FD
[17:40:02] <Visigoth_> :D
[17:40:30] <Visigoth_> ill look into it more thanks
[17:40:42] <Visigoth_> was thinking python too ?
[17:41:09] <Visigoth_> sorry this really is the wrong irc to be askin this
[17:41:15] <adyeah> wouldnt waste my time with python/django...
[17:41:17] <Visigoth_> thanks for ur input
[17:41:21] <Visigoth_> ahh kk
[17:41:28] <adyeah> python dont really seem set on becoming anything great in regards to web
[17:41:36] <adyeah> ruby on rails would be a better alternative
[17:41:42] <adyeah> but its basically the same shit as php + mvc framework
[17:41:59] <Visigoth_> adyeah: yeah i think ill read up on rails more - seems to be fairly popular
[17:42:35] <adyeah> ruby on rails is slow as shit
[17:42:38] <adyeah> just so you know
[17:44:14] <Visigoth_> haha lol
[17:44:26] <Visigoth_> c++, node.js  ??
[17:44:37] <Visigoth_> i think ima start there :p
[17:46:38] <adyeah> Visigoth_ : http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/php_needs_to_die_what_will_replace_it
[17:48:17] <adyeah> you can write modules for node.js in c++ so that should be pretty darn fast, if done right
[17:48:31] <adyeah> it's probably cool to have a use for c++ again as well
[17:48:43] <adyeah> or a reason to learn it
[17:53:34] <buu> adyeah: haha that article you linked is pretty hilarious
[17:53:52] <adyeah> heh I guess one can find all sorts of things amusing about it
[17:54:06] <buu> " The language was full of anachronistic features -- pointers (update: sorry, references), inconvenient hash structures, and a dozen other little language quirks"
[17:55:55] <adyeah> hmm
[17:56:27] <adyeah> if I knew php I'm sure I'd find it funny as well
[17:56:44] <buu> I love how the dude doesn't know what pointers are but thinks they're anachronistic
[17:56:51] <adyeah> hah
[17:56:54] <buu> And the idea that you could usefully program without something similar is just mind blowing
[17:57:28] <buu> The main humour in the article comes from the idea that "well if php doesn't have it, it must not be useful"
[17:57:54] <Visigoth_> interesting read - i was trying to find this breakup letter this dev wrote leaving php to node
[17:58:02] <adyeah> heheh
[17:58:07] <buu> Despite php spending the last 10 years desperately trying to add all of the features from perl it missed copying the first go-round
[17:58:20] <Visigoth_> yeah PHP has come a long way even in the last 5 years
[17:58:30] <aniasis> how can I get the request parameters from the jqXhr object?
[17:59:01] <mib_mib> would it be a bad idea to use jquery in an advertisement javascript?
[18:00:22] <aniasis> mib_mib, no
[18:00:23] <Visigoth_> $.ajaxSetup({     "error": function(jqXHR, status, thrownError) {         alert('error');         var responseText = jQuery.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseText);         console.log(responseText);     } });
[18:00:27] <adyeah> buu: the article might be right in that php + mvc framework doesnt have a proper successor though?
[18:00:40] <adyeah> buu: at least not one worthy of just writing php off
[18:00:41] <aniasis> mib_mib, I don't know why you would though.
[18:00:54] <mib_mib> because its easier
[18:01:02] <aniasis> easier to do what?
[18:01:06] <mib_mib> to implement stuff
[18:01:19] <buu> adyeah: Sure, if we assume php has finally gotten all the features/frameworks/libraries that other languages have had for a while, then no, there's not really a successor
[18:01:27] <aniasis> implement what stuff Mr. Ambigous
[18:01:33] <aniasis> ?
[18:01:36] <Visigoth_> for serious - PHP isn't going anywhere anytime soon
[18:01:45] <adyeah> visi sure... that's a given
[18:01:48] <aniasis> PHP is dead
[18:02:09] <buu> adyeah: I'm not sure we're at the point in computer language development where we're likely to get 'successors' in a meaningful way
[18:02:12] <Visigoth_> weird how some of the largest websites on the net use it still
[18:02:12] <buu> I mean, look at apache
[18:02:14] <aniasis> Anything you can do with PHP you can do with java
[18:02:17] <mib_mib> aniasis: lol - you know, searching through the DOM, implementing listeners / bindings, searching text, etc
[18:02:21] <adyeah> people will work on php, java, perl, objective c and all kinds of shit for many, many years to come
[18:02:31] <buu> Sure, people are still maintaining cobol
[18:02:38] <Visigoth_> haha yeah
[18:02:41] <aniasis> mib_mib, why would you want that in an advertisement?
[18:02:44] <buu> I mean, maybe perl6 will finally get done, in 10 years or so, and blow our pants off
[18:02:53] <mib_mib> aniasis - the ad has targeting logic
[18:03:02] <buu> But it seems unlikely we're getting a major change in how programming works
[18:03:23] <adyeah> buu: hehe.... it's all conditional statements anyway...
[18:03:28] <buu> heh
[18:03:35] <Visigoth_> lolol
[18:03:44] <aniasis> ahh
[18:03:48] <adyeah> what is the term....
[18:03:50] <adyeah> turing complete?
[18:03:52] <aniasis> mib_mib, understandable.
[18:03:53] <buu> The next big change might be a language that's more fully integrated with a database
[18:03:58] <adyeah> you cna do the same thing in all languages
[18:04:23] <aniasis> mib_mib, yes I would but I would load a lite version on jq and then add it all to the same javascript file you are loading on the page
[18:04:23] <adyeah> but ofcourse frameworks makes all the difference...
[18:04:30] <coldhead> how much more done do you need perl6 to be?
[18:04:43] <buu> coldhead: Uh, a released non-beta version would be a start?
[18:04:59] <coldhead> beta is just a label
[18:05:05] <mib_mib> aniasis: have you used a CDN before
[18:05:22] <buu> adyeah: Yeah, for me it's just impossible to leave cpan behind
[18:06:12] <aniasis> mib_mib, yes
[18:06:40] <adyeah> buu: the way you speak of perl i'm getting a really oldschool vibe
[18:06:47] <adyeah> buu: you can't be a young dude? no offense meant
[18:07:01] <buu> Heh, I'm 26
[18:07:02] <Visigoth_> hes prolly mid twenties :D
[18:07:04] <adyeah> what
[18:07:06] <adyeah> that is crazy
[18:07:11] <Visigoth_> ahhh i was right!
[18:07:12] <Visigoth_> haha
[18:07:20] <adyeah> that is too young
[18:07:21] <mib_mib> aniasis: if i have a script that just loads a seperate javascript from say mysite.com/script2.js, and I want this script to load fast and be cached on the browser so i load it from a CDN, but eventually I want to make changes to script2.js, how can I invalidate it so the persons browser needs to redownload script2.js?
[18:07:26] <adyeah> too young for perl
[18:07:35] <buu> I learned perl after most of the perl4 cruft had died out
[18:07:37] <aniasis> mib_mib, My point being is that if you are loading jq you don't know if jq is already loading on the page.  Loading it twice is bad practice.  You have to determine if the jq object exists and load if it doesn't
[18:07:40] <Visigoth_> dude i was using perl in AOL days shit man
[18:07:42] <buu> So from my perspective it's a pretty modern language
[18:07:53] <Visigoth_> fuckin compuserv
[18:07:54] <adyeah> well
[18:07:55] <adyeah> it is from the 80s
[18:07:56] <adyeah> :D
[18:08:08] <buu> Yeah, but it's been changing pretty constantly, perl5 is certainly not from the 80s
[18:08:28] <adyeah> what year did you start learning it
[18:08:31] <buu> A couple of years ago someone implemented a pretty major object system in perl, called moose, that's more 'modern' than just about any other object system
[18:08:54] <buu> adyeah: Uh, 2000 or so?
[18:09:00] <mib_mib> aniasis: isnt it the browser that determines whether a file is cached locally or not? I.e. you send the expiration headers for a downloaded file....
[18:09:32] <coldhead> i have a feeling there'll be a mass migration to perl6 from JS once JSers realise that JS is mostly used for text processing and really sucks at text processing
[18:09:40] <buu> haha
[18:09:45] <adyeah> buu: hehe, ok... I had to quickly browse wikipedia
[18:10:00] <buu> coldhead: I'd love to see perl6 get the hype going like ruby did
[18:10:18] <Visigoth_> well you guys have convinced at least one dev to check it out :p
[18:10:26] <buu> Yay!
[18:10:46] <adyeah> now adays
[18:10:51] <adyeah> i think actually i was using asp
[18:10:53] <adyeah> when you was using perl
[18:10:57] <adyeah> and it was shit
[18:10:59] <coldhead> perl is a lot of fun
[18:11:00] <buu> haha
[18:11:19] <buu> I enjoy perl because it's much closer to english, or at least, a human language, than, say, C
[18:11:29] <coldhead> well said!
[18:11:32] <adyeah> but now adays, people are actually talking favorably about asp net mvc
[18:11:35] <coldhead> praise to the natural linguists
[18:11:38] <buu> =]
[18:11:53] <buu> adyeah: I'm sure asp has evolved to be not completely awful
[18:11:59] <adyeah> hehehe
[18:12:02] <adyeah> they say so
[18:12:47] <coldhead> with enough glitter, any turd can shine
[18:12:51] <adyeah> personally i dont like anything requiring a windows server
[18:13:01] <buu> Yeah, I'm pretty addicted to bash + vim
[18:13:01] <adyeah> and yes i know about mono
[18:13:06] <coldhead> but if you eat the glitter first the glitter goes ALL THE WAY THROUGH
[18:13:13] <buu> adyeah: I've heard some pretty good things about C# really
[18:13:24] <buu> I really wish java was much closer to C#
[18:13:31] <adyeah> hmm
[18:13:45] <adyeah> well writing the code is very similiar
[18:13:50] <adyeah> functionality i dunno...
[18:13:57] <buu> C# has a lot more syntactic sugar
[18:14:02] <buu> I guess java is getting there also
[18:14:19] <adyeah> you hardly need to write code anymore with eclipse or visual studio or the likes
[18:14:22] <buu> haha
[18:14:24] <adyeah> it's all code snippets and shit
[18:14:27] <buu> That's kind of worrying
[18:14:40] <adyeah> at least its useful for things like properties
[18:14:44] <adyeah> just saving some time
[18:15:07] <buu> Well yeah, but I'd much rather have that built into the language
[18:16:05] <aniasis> mib_mib, the browser caches based on the request not the response.  So it would not know whether your file is the same file.
[18:16:20] <adyeah> the thing about c#... i dont have anything against it... i've used it a bit, but used java more...
[18:16:34] <adyeah> i just don't have any use for it, what would i use it for....  i'm not making desktop apps
[18:16:42] <adyeah> i don't even have use for java anymore
[18:17:10] <mib_mib> hmmmmm.... no browser caches based on response for SURE
[18:17:24] <adyeah> c#, as for web, again, windows servers....
[18:18:03] <adyeah> for web now i'd much rather just go javascript/node/mongodb
[18:18:26] <buu> I like a lot of things about javascript but some of its nits just drive me nuts
[18:18:42] <adyeah> proper classes would be nice
[18:19:03] <buu> Well, yeah, but I mostly just want a foreach loop that doesn't involve a closure
[18:19:07] <buu> And proper variable scoping
[18:19:47] <adyeah> how bout some floats
[18:19:48] <adyeah> lol
[18:20:25] <buu> Possibly that also! And a sane version of cpan
[18:22:01] <coldhead> npm is supposed to be that
[18:22:04] <coldhead> and bower
[18:22:24] <Visigoth_> wow you guys are entertaining as hell and i love it - but i must go have a good night everyone :)   thanks for the help
[18:23:56] <adyeah> i actually think its the closures that get me the most, as far as syntax errors go
[18:24:06] <adyeah> i mean there's a lot of curly bracing and shit in java as welll
[18:24:22] <adyeah> but come on javascript is at times just... blah
[18:24:48] <adyeah> and debugging just by browser consoles
[18:24:50] <adyeah> i waste a lot of time
[18:32:47] <black_warlock> arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[18:32:51] <black_warlock> damed ui
[18:32:57] <black_warlock> dameeeeeeeeeeed UIIIIIIIIIIIIII
[18:49:38] <coldhead> so things are going well then huh black warlock?
[19:04:08] <rmurphey> brutal, coldhead, brutal
[19:10:31] <aniasis> does anyone know how I can view the request headers of my $.ajax call?
[19:15:03] <gnat_x> hey folks, i'm looking for a jquery based slideshow that will let me continually keep adding images. the use case is that we're doing this event where we want people to send their pics of the event. we've already got images going into a directory, but i'm having trouble finding a gallery tool that can handle me appending more images on the fly.
[19:15:21] <gnat_x> anyone tried anything that works for that?
[19:15:35] <gnat_x> i would like to avoid writing yet another slideshow.
[20:02:33] <azbyin> hi all..
[20:03:20] <azbyin> is there a page where I can download a customised jquery-ui 1.8.24?
[20:05:01] <vladikoff> azbyin, one sec
[20:05:42] <vladikoff> azbyin, so 1.9.0 http://jqueryui.com/download/ is no good for you?
[20:06:10] <azbyin> nope.. i need 1.8.24 custom..
[20:09:05] <vladikoff> azbyin, here you go buddy https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.8.24/ui
[20:09:41] <vladikoff> azbyin, hopefully that works for you
[20:10:19] <azbyin> vladikoff, no worries mate. its available at old.jqueryui.com/download  (from #jqueryui-dev)
[20:10:54] <vladikoff> azbyin, oh ok :) perfect, but in case that goes away, all versions are tagged on github
[20:43:25] <mikeumus> maybe a silly question but is there a way to chain if statements? I have to if statements that if true are going to call the same function so I figured if I could chain the somehow I should.
[20:44:15] <versatiletech> mikeumus: combine the conditions into one if statement
[20:44:27] <mikeumus> hum
[20:44:43] <mikeumus> let me see what it'd look like,  1 sec
[20:45:07] <versatiletech> if( condition1 || condition2 ){ // blablabla }
[20:46:00] <mikeumus> if($('.adinkIcon').is(':visible') || window.location.hash='#start'){ function(); }
[20:46:16] <versatiletech> that should work just fine
[20:46:31] <mikeumus> cool
[20:46:48] <mikeumus> told you it was a silly question, but thanks versatiletech
[20:46:52] <mikeumus> 8)
[20:46:55] <versatiletech> np
[20:47:43] <mikeumus> just starting to go beyond just animate() and css() into more logicy type stuff
[20:48:10] <versatiletech> have you done programming before?
[20:50:11] <mikeumus> for a while actually I can understand it good, the concepts that is
[20:50:24] <mikeumus> but just need some muscle memory and getting the hands dirty.
[20:50:40] <mikeumus> managing a cool node.js project actually
[20:50:54] <versatiletech> yeah, once you get some hands on experience it starts coming naturally
[20:50:54] <mikeumus> I'm more of a ront end guy so I'm making a mockup frontend for the product now
[20:50:59] <mikeumus> yeah
[20:51:05] <versatiletech> oh yeah?
[20:51:09] <mikeumus> I've been looking forward to getting good at it for a while
[20:51:10] <mikeumus> yeah
[20:51:13] <versatiletech> UI dude?
[20:51:32] <mikeumus> that's my forte I guess but I'm the type that know a little of everything
[20:51:39] <versatiletech> PM me
[20:52:00] <mikeumus> 1 sec
[20:52:11] <mikeumus> I always forget the irc commands
[20:52:22] <versatiletech> ha you need a good GUI
[20:52:43] <versatiletech> you could just probably right click my name
[20:52:44] <mikeumus> yeah I'm just using webchat.freenode
[20:52:54] <versatiletech> oh try clicking my name
[20:53:09] <mikeumus> it gives me your WHOIS
[20:53:37] <versatiletech> you on Windows or Mac?
[20:54:05] <mikeumus> windows
[20:56:38] <mikeumus> I've tried a few commands with no luck so far. embarrassing .
[20:57:07] <mikeumus> got it
[21:33:13] <raj> is using the name attribute not recommended?
[21:33:14] <raj> http://geekswithblogs.net/SanjayU/archive/2010/02/03/jquery-get-value-of-checked-checkboxes-by-name--classname.aspx
[21:33:35] <raj> should I use class instead?
[21:37:51] <versatiletech> raj: you can use name. If you have a form and javascript is turned off you can at least consume the form. In general in jQuery you want to use the fastest method to get an element, class is good, but using an id selector is the fastest if you can use it.
[21:39:20] <raj> got it, thanks
[21:39:57] <raj> let me also ask this then, what would be the most efficient way to make this an array of all found values? `var somearray = $('.someclass:checked').val()`
[21:41:11] <Eviltwin> With a .amp
[21:41:14] <Eviltwin> .map*
[21:41:19] <raj> aah, there it is
[21:41:30] <raj> i couldn't remember the freaking method
[21:41:34] <raj> thank you
[21:41:40] <raj> ...i'm so freaking rusty
[22:01:02] <raj> so I can't JSON.stringify(somearray) ?
[22:01:17] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:01:28] <Eviltwin> You can
[22:05:47] <raj> Uncaught TypeError: Accessing selectionDirection on an input element that cannot have a selection.
[22:18:47] <raj`> sorry, got disconnected
[22:18:51] <raj`> anyway, that's the error I get
[22:21:27] <raj> var data = {}, somearray = $('input.somecb:checked').map(function(i,el) {return $(el).val()}); data['somearray'] = JSON.stringify(somearray)
[22:22:04] <raj> --> Uncaught TypeError: Accessing selectionDirection on an input element that cannot have a selection.
[22:25:12] <raj> anyone?
[22:25:36] <vladikoff> raj, what's your end goal in one sentence?
[22:26:01] <raj> I want an array that I can $.POST
[22:26:15] <raj> so I believe I must JSON.stringify
[22:26:26] <Eviltwin> raj: What happens if you leave off the data['somearray'] = JSON.stringify(somearray)?
[22:26:36] <Eviltwin> Oh
[22:26:42] <raj> I get another error regarding $.post
[22:26:43] <Eviltwin> .get() method after .map()
[22:26:49] <raj> what's that do?
[22:26:56] <Eviltwin> Look it up :P
[22:27:25] <raj> gets an index
[22:27:32] <raj> but why isn't .val() just collecting values?
[22:27:37] <raj> as in, just the strings
[22:27:50] <Eviltwin> raj: .get() not .get(...)
[22:27:51] <raj> as opposed to a jquery object
[22:28:06] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:29:07] <raj> don't get it
[22:29:13] <raj> don't get why it's required here
[22:30:35] <raj> I suppose everyone is just as perplexed :)
[22:33:14] <vladikoff> raj, one sec
[22:34:17] <vladikoff> raj, does this help http://jsfiddle.net/GbfRn/ ?
[22:37:31] <raj> why does .map() create an array with other jquery stuff in it? http://jsfiddle.net/GbfRn/1/
[22:54:22] <NexHD> hi
[22:54:47] <Whirl3d> any possible chance that someone could recommend a simple CMS that would allow me to use jquery to instantiate pages/elements/posts/etc.?
[22:55:21] <Whirl3d> hi NexHD
[22:55:33] <NexHD> i want to ask how i do with regex to restrict in input this [aaaaaa] or [bbbb] .... [zzzzz]
[22:55:33] <NexHD> ?
[22:55:43] <Whirl3d> Sunday nights/MOnday mornings are the worst here
[22:55:55] <Whirl3d> Especially for a regex question   try #regex
[23:03:55] <hanson> NexHD:  /^([a-z])\1+$/
[23:15:31] <Cork> \1??
[23:17:06] <hanson> ye
[23:17:23] <Cork> that'll just match the number 1
[23:17:45] <hanson> have a try
[23:19:12] <raj> is there any easy way to make my page not refresh when clicking a link, but instead load that page via javascript so I can leave the topbar in place with its notifications and async connection?
[23:19:13] <Cork> whats its meant to do then?
[23:19:30] <Cork> raj: no
[23:19:38] <coldhead> ?ajax.load
[23:19:38] <raj> therefore, no disconnection from sockjs required
[23:19:41] <bot-t> coldhead, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[23:19:46] <Cork> raj: that would be code injection
[23:19:56] <Cork> you could do that ca 13 years ago
[23:20:09] <raj> but what about what coldhead is saying?
[23:20:15] <coldhead> oh ignore me
[23:20:19] <coldhead> i assumed you meant the same domain
[23:20:20] <Cork> thats not reloading the page
[23:20:28] <Cork> it just loads the content through js
[23:20:30] <coldhead> i defer to Cork's wisdom
[23:20:33] <coldhead> do whatever he says
[23:20:36] <Cork> <_<'
[23:20:45] <coldhead> HE OR SHE
[23:21:03] <raj> so can't I just load the content onto #content?
[23:21:19] <Cork> raj: you have two options; 1. do a full page reload and deal with it; 2. prevent links from reloading and insted fetch it through js and replace the parts you want
[23:21:33] <coldhead> or 3. use flash
[23:21:48] <Cork> raj: ugg i miss read you question
[23:22:10] <Cork> raj: i read it as reload the page but, not "not reaload the page" :)
[23:22:19] <raj> :)
[23:22:29] <Cork> raj: so ya, ajax load or similar is what you want
[23:22:34] <raj> so basically, I can leave my notification bar as is
[23:22:46] <raj> and no disconnection happens from sockjs
[23:22:52] <raj> ...is there a downside to this?
[23:22:58] <raj> is it slow or anything?
[23:23:15] <hanson> \num Matches num, where num is a positive integer. A reference back to captured matches. For example, '(.)\1' matches two consecutive identical characters.
[23:23:22] <Cork> raj: the url won't change
[23:23:34] <coldhead> you might want to watch for memory leaks if you leave it running a long time, raj
[23:23:52] * Cork nods
[23:24:00] <raj> hmm, k, that seems like reason enough not to do it
[23:24:10] <raj> why would it cause a memory leak?
[23:24:12] <coldhead> it seems like reason to do it properly
[23:24:20] <coldhead> and make sure you don't leak memory
[23:24:26] <raj> how can I do that?
[23:24:45] <Cork> hanson: interesting, what regex standard is that?
[23:24:56] <Cork> raj: its not that it causes
[23:25:02] <Whirl3d> Hey guys, If you have a semi-learning disabled artist friend ( i know retarded is the new "n" word) and they want a simple gallery with their images and some data about each, is there a jquery based or jquery friendly cms to do this?
[23:25:03] <Cork> its that your never unloading your page
[23:25:24] <Cork> raj: so if something leaks, it won't get purged just cause you follow a link
[23:25:34] <Cork> raj: additionally, it won't work for external links
[23:25:56] <raj> k, these are all internal links
[23:26:27] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a:not(a[href^="http"])', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $('#container').load(this.href); })
[23:26:31] <Cork> raj: ^
[23:27:46] <raj> beautiful! thank you :)
[23:27:47] <hanson> Cork: find out http://www.regextester.com/jssyntax.html
[23:28:30] <Cork> hmm that one talks about jscript
[23:28:38] <Cork> i would be careful with cross browser support
[23:29:23] <raj> also, is there a test for memory leaks in my page?
[23:29:29] <Cork> raj: no
[23:29:39] <Cork> testing memory leaks is quite hard
[23:29:58] <Cork> only way to test it is to see if the page uses more memory then you expect
[23:30:25] <Cork> and even then you can't really be sure thats a leak
[23:31:01] <Cork> raj: but if you talk pure javascript, a variable you haven't defined in your scope is a good example of a leak source
[23:32:12] <raj> meaning a global variable?
[23:32:13] <Cork> browser dom can leak in some browsers too, when you do certain actions
[23:32:17] <Cork> raj: yes
[23:32:28] <raj> I have a couple window variables
[23:32:45] <Cork> or of you define a variable in a scope and keep a reference to a function that reaches that scope around
[23:32:52] <Cork> that means that memory won't ever be released
[23:33:40] <zest> help
[23:33:46] <Cork> so ex. event listeners is another harry thing to be careful about
[23:34:02] <Cork> or specially the callback functions
[23:34:14] <Cork> *specifically
[23:34:29] <Cork> ?ask @ zest
[23:34:29] <bot-t> zest, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:40:21] <GoSox> is there a jQuery function i could use to move an element from one parent to another?
[23:43:46] <hanson> GoSox appendTo
[23:44:07] <GoSox> wouldn't that just duplicate?
[23:46:58] <hanson> no duplicate
[23:58:25] <raj> Cork, even with $.history I can't change the url?
[23:58:32] <raj> only the hash
[23:58:32] <raj> ?
