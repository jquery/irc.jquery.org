[00:18:56] <[1]domino> is possibe to use 2 form one inside other?
[00:19:08] <[1]domino> with jquery
[00:19:34] <[1]domino> i need to put at certain point of a form a photo upload form
[00:20:09] <[1]domino> but seems that the jquery can't recognize the form when i put it inside the main form
[00:20:50] <ph88> is there any way jQuery can help making this code smaller and more elegant ??  http://jsfiddle.net/bZ6WV/1/
[00:58:07] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to display a returned ajax data but I can't do. http://pastebin.com/GNJKxZgh If I see the response on the firebug I see that is returns data, but I don't know how to print. Any help please?

[02:08:16] <uskerine> =
[02:08:18] <uskerine> ?
[02:15:19] <uskerine> is this .value usage correct?
[02:15:22] <uskerine> $(this).closest('tr').find('input[name="qty"]').value.trim().replace(/ /g,'')
[02:17:06] <krambiorix> uskerine, val()
[02:18:25] <uskerine> can .value be used in any case?

[03:58:30] <ZP18> sorry
[03:58:32] <wa5ted> doesnt matter
[03:58:34] <wa5ted> be considerate
[03:58:36] <wa5ted> anyways
[03:58:38] <ZP18> can you help me?
[03:58:39] <wa5ted> wahts your issue
[03:58:42] <wa5ted> illtry
[03:58:42] <ZP18> ok
[03:59:00] <ZP18> I have a navigation thing with buttons...
[03:59:12] <ZP18> when you click a button it does the effect puff
[03:59:38] <ZP18> got it so far?
[04:00:14] <ZP18> wa5ted: I'll make a fiddle first
[04:00:17] <ZP18> one sec
[04:01:10] <[1]domino> what is the right contenttype for sending file quit xml request?
[04:01:15] <[1]domino> *whit
[04:01:44] <wa5ted> ZP18: sure
[04:01:53] <ZP18> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/VzGWK/
[04:02:19] <ZP18> I want to prevent the second button from moving when the other one does puff
[04:02:47] <wa5ted> okay
[04:02:47] <wa5ted> whats uppose to happen
[04:02:54] <decx> first of all get rid of that mouseenter fadeTo nonsense and do that with css
[04:03:17] <ZP18> decx: I'm doing with jquery because it looks better
[04:03:23] <wa5ted> do a custom animation
[04:03:27] <wa5ted> and do a fade
[04:03:28] <ZP18> instead of straightaway to something
[04:03:30] <wa5ted> ofteh opacity
[04:03:33] <wa5ted> instead of the display
[04:03:36] <decx> transition
[04:03:39] <ZP18> ok
[04:03:42] <wa5ted> youll have to create your own "puff" animation
[04:03:54] <wa5ted> decx: but he needs jquery ui's puff animation
[04:04:00] <ZP18> good idea wa5ted didn't think of that
[04:04:05] <wa5ted> yup
[04:04:20] <decx> it's ineffective anyway
[04:04:25] <wa5ted> is it supose to puff and come back wheni click it?
[04:04:37] <wa5ted> well decx we dont nknow he use case
[04:04:40] <ZP18> only if you keep your mouse there
[04:05:34] <ZP18> well thanx guys imma start on making my own animation
[04:06:01] <ZP18> just ping me if you want to tell me something
[04:06:12] <decx> judging by the ample duplication of js and css i'd say the use case doesnt matter as of yet wa5ted
[04:06:44] <arschmitz> ZP18: this does basicly what you want i think http://jsfiddle.net/VzGWK/2/
[04:07:12] <arschmitz> ZP18: though you would want to remove the clone after which that does not
[04:07:35] <ZP18> ok I'll check now
[04:08:01] <wa5ted> decx: gg
[04:08:42] <ZP18> arschmitz: that is perfect! thanks man
[04:11:47] <decx> ZP18 here's a simplified example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/VzGWK/4/
[04:14:45] <ZP18> decx: thats nice but I can't make it link to a page after the animation finishes, or can I?...
[04:15:09] <decx> sure
[04:15:20] <decx> you can do anything you want
[04:15:36] <decx> the world is your oyster and stuff
[04:15:58] <ZP18> decx: yeh I'll just do a setTimeout
[04:16:10] <decx> when i said anything you want i didnt mean that
[04:16:44] <decx> there is a transitionEnd event
[04:16:59] <ZP18> decx:  ok
[04:17:26] <decx> then again if you just want to link i wouldnt bother offsetting that to the end of the animation
[04:17:46] <ZP18> but I am trying to test my skills with jquery so Imma stick with the setTimeout
[04:18:00] <marko-_-> hey guys just a question
[04:18:11] <marko-_-> $("div#intro .head") this selects all div's with either id intro or class head?
[04:18:27] <ZP18> no
[04:18:29] <decx> putting timeouts anywhere isnt something you want to get used to
[04:18:37] <decx> everywhere*
[04:18:42] <marko-_-> ZP18, then it has to select all divs with the id intro and class head
[04:19:14] <ZP18> marko-_-: if done like that they both have to be present on the div
[04:19:33] <marko-_-> yes i know it's just a question from a quiz
[04:19:39] <ZP18> oh ok
[04:19:59] <decx> it's just like in css
[04:20:05] <decx> element descendent
[04:20:20] <decx> if you want ot select multiple use , to separate
[04:20:25] <decx> $('element,element')
[04:20:34] <ZP18> ^
[04:22:06] <ZP18> decx: can you do the transitionend event to take it to a site (just to google will be fine for the test) because I'm not advanced css I'm only very basic
[04:23:19] <decx> i wouldnt rely on it because then you have to include fallbacks for the basic function of a link
[04:25:21] <decx> ZP18 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/VzGWK/6/
[04:25:37] <ZP18> thnx decx
[04:34:24] <marko-_-> $("div").height(100) is this the right jquery syntax for setting height to 100 for divs?
[04:34:33] <marko-_-> 100px*
[04:35:04] <slax0r> yes
[04:35:06] <slax0r> default is px
[04:35:45] <marko-_-> thanks slax0r
[04:35:52] <slax0r> np
[04:35:53] <decx> either .height(100) or .height('100px')
[04:36:10] <marko-_-> thanks :)
[04:36:21] <slax0r> decx: you can ommit the px, you need the unit only if you want something else, like em or % or whatnot
[04:37:11] <decx> ah
[04:42:56] <ZP18> decx:  when I copy it to local it isn't workin
[04:43:13] <ZP18> the hover is but not the click
[04:46:00] <ZP18> nvm I found problem

[05:21:13] <Radditz> Hello
[05:21:22] <Radditz> how can I set input to checked without triggering the click trigger
[05:21:24] <Radditz> ty
[05:21:50] <decx> didnt i tell you that 3 days ago?
[05:21:51] <silverdust> <input type="checkbox" checked>
[05:22:07] <silverdust> Amnesia :P
[05:22:11] <decx> $('input').prop('checked',true)
[05:22:21] <Amnesia> silverdust: ?
[05:22:40] <Radditz> decx: and what won't trigger the click?
[05:22:48] <silverdust> lol someone actually owns that nick :)
[05:23:14] <Radditz> decx: how do I get my state (when I check a checkbox, how do I know if it's checked or unchecked?
[05:23:42] <decx> .prop('checked') will return true or false
[05:24:06] <Radditz> decx: so this will be the checkbox itself?
[05:24:22] <decx> yes
[05:24:41] <Radditz> thank you decx ,Ill go test this, bbl
[05:27:19] <silverdust> decx: I asked this yesterday but didn't get a clear response
[05:28:02] <silverdust> I have been using $(document).on('event','.class'); to pick even elements that are not ready on page load. I'm using a  plugin with a function like $('.class').pluginFunction() and it doesn't affect the contents that were included with  javascript
[05:28:33] <decx> either rewrite the plugin to delegate itself or run it after you add new stuff
[05:30:05] <silverdust> decx: how do I do that? I added <script>$('.class').pluginFunction(); </script> to the inserted template
[05:30:12] <silverdust> and it didn't still pick it
[05:32:33] <silverdust> then I edited my JS like http://jsfiddle.net/d7jKC/
[05:32:41] <Hyperking> greetings, when using jquery .on() method does the container div need to be the parent?
[05:33:34] <silverdust> thinking by doing that, I'm making it available to the newly inserted innerHTML
[05:33:42] <silverdust> but it still failed
[05:34:08] <silverdust> Hyperking: how?
[05:35:30] <decx> i dont think the script gets executed
[05:36:25] <silverdust> It's working for the elements that are readily available
[05:36:40] <silverdust> I wonder why it's not for this
[05:37:43] <Hyperking> silverdust: http://jsfiddle.net/VZYzE/3/ seems to only work on parent div
[05:37:59] <Hyperking> by changin #child to #papa
[05:40:06] <silverdust> you mean you want to change id="child" to id="papa" ?
[05:40:33] <Hyperking> no, im wrong...it seems to work on child http://jsfiddle.net/VZYzE/4/
[05:40:47] <silverdust> oh I get it now
[05:41:05] <Hyperking> weird that im my production app it doesn't work unless its the parent element
[05:41:07] <silverdust> yea it should as far as li a is contained in #child
[05:42:03] <silverdust> I love to put it as $(document) most times though I'm still a JS noob and that way I think it's best for me

[05:47:55] <nicolas_FR> hi there, I've a problem with IE11 and jQuery 1.8.2 (tried too with 1.11.1) + validation plugin (v1.11.1) : when validating a file form, I've a message saying the size method is not available on a null object. But this works with FF30, chrome, IE8+ etc. Only IE11 seems to crash on it. Any known issue with validation and IE11 ?

[05:59:09] <el_inventor> good mornign :)
[05:59:26] <el_inventor> from Venezuela :)
[06:01:21] <decx> there's a difference between attributes and data aleray
[06:17:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can anyone help me with this issue? http://jsfiddle.net/QDhqa/
[06:18:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I can't override the width of the button because it's not know upfront how long the text will be, and the base button style is 30px
[06:18:00] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: width: auto;
[06:18:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> for some reason that is not working in my project. Using bootstrap button classes
[06:19:05] <BillCriswell> You're probably not being specific enough.
[06:19:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the button is directly under #wrapper
[06:20:11] <BillCriswell> Understood...
[06:20:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it does override because when i put 200px, the size adjusts
[06:20:42] <DelphiWorld> var language = 'en';
[06:20:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I can't reproduce that in jsfiddle, annoying
[06:20:57] <DelphiWorld> how to change the variable using a combobox language selector?
[06:22:17] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://jsbin.com/vufoxuhi/1/edit?html,css,output
[06:22:43] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Look at the dev tools, see why "width: auto" is crossed out or see if there's something else on it like a max-width.
[06:22:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes it works there
[06:22:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[06:22:56] <jangoh> i am trying to add css handler with submit handler http://dpaste.com/38T3RMM
[06:22:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sec
[06:23:02] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell, http://www.webgeekly.com/tutorials/jquery/how-to-make-your-site-multilingual-using-xml-and-jquery/
[06:23:44] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell, is there the pocibility to select the language using a combobox and not  staticaly define it using vars?
[06:24:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> BillCriswell,; this is what it says: header #actions #you .you-content button{border:0;width:auto}
[06:24:49] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Get this.value of the select and then when the select changes run that request.
[06:24:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how can it be?!
[06:25:12] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: what widget you recomand for the select
[06:25:15] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I don't know. Doesn't look like bootstrap css to me. Way too specific.
[06:25:32] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I don't haha, just plain jQuery.
[06:25:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's inside a btn-group
[06:26:06] <BillCriswell> $('select[name=language]').on('change', function () { var lang = this.value; $.ajax({...}); });
[06:26:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
[06:26:44] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Figure out what's over riding it and be more specific than it. Inspect the element and figure out what's going on.
[06:26:51] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell ... the select in this case is a combobox?
[06:27:04] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I don't know what a combobox is.
[06:27:16] <DelphiWorld> lol BillCriswell
[06:27:40] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: is a  list where you select stufs
[06:27:56] <BillCriswell> <select><option>Hello</option></select> like this?
[06:28:28] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: mmmmmmmm... i belieuv its a form element
[06:28:40] <BillCriswell> form elements don't have a value.
[06:29:09] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: you see when you register to a site they ask you about your country?
[06:29:19] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: http://jsfiddle.net/ go here and paste the relevant html, css and js and it'll be much clearer.
[06:29:22] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Yes.
[06:29:42] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: that component what you call it
[06:30:03] <BillCriswell> A select element usually.
[06:30:08] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/4CKuD/ this thing?
[06:30:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> When I take it out of the wrapper and put it elsewhere width: auto does work
[06:30:26] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I just showed you it does work, right?
[06:30:33] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: i dont think you remember but jsf make me mad... due to bad accessibility
[06:30:50] <BillCriswell> I don't know what jsf is.
[06:31:05] <ocm> jsf, joint strike fighter? :P
[06:31:10] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: jsfiddle
[06:31:17] <DelphiWorld> lol ocm
[06:31:32] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhh ok.
[06:31:46] <BillCriswell> It's 99% of the time a <select> element.
[06:32:03] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswelllet me read about it
[06:33:43] <Amnesia> question, is there some way to select elements based on certain properties, just like attributes, the reason I'm asking is because I'd like to check whether a div contains an input element with a particular value
[06:34:51] <ocm> amnesia, I would suggest loop through the divs and check for the input and given value within this loop
[06:35:19] <ocm> if the input/value is there, add the div to an object array
[06:35:19] <Amnesia> ocm: hm, isn't there an alternative, I'd like to use has()
[06:36:22] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You can't use has there since an attribute selector won't get the updated value.
[06:37:43] <Amnesia> hm ok
[06:37:46] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: http://pastie.org/pastes/9331195/text this is basically what they're suggesting for the JS.
[06:38:38] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: ok, just the name was confusing someone call it listbox... someone combobox someone selectbox;)
[06:38:43] <BillCriswell> Then use <select name="language"><option value="en">English</option><option value="es">Spanish</option></select> and the variable lang would be en or es as the select changes.
[06:39:11] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Yeah, a combo box to me would basically be a select box with an input box built into it.
[06:39:28] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: lol right
[06:39:31] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You'd have to use .filter() which would behave vet similarly.
[06:39:37] <BillCriswell> very*
[06:40:01] <BillCriswell> .has() is probably just .filter() with a simple .find().length inside.
[06:40:09] <Amnesia> ty
[06:40:15] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell, what's the official naming of selectbox in jquery
[06:40:35] <BillCriswell> The select box isn't a jQuery thing, it's just an element in HTML.
[06:41:06] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: ah. i love using jquery stufs like listviews
[06:41:14] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: i am more concerned about accessibility
[06:41:40] <BillCriswell> I figured a select would be really accessible since it's been around probably as long as me haha
[06:41:51] <DelphiWorld> looooool BillCriswell
[06:43:56] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: ok, stupid me... got it now
[06:44:59] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: http://jsbin.com/zocaqori/1/edit?html,js,output This is how it would work if the value can be changed and you need to select it. If the value won't be changed when you're selecting it you can do $('div').has('input=[value="Item 4"]') though.
[06:47:21] <BillCriswell> Basically, you can use the attribute selector on the actual attribute value and not what the user updates the value to.
[06:48:28] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: ty
[06:48:33] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: No problem.
[06:49:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok I have the width correct, but now the content inside the button has to float to the right, it contains a picture and a text, the text goes on the right side of the pic, left aligned
[06:52:00] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Sounds like fun.
[06:54:15] <decx> where's the jquery part
[06:55:35] <BillCriswell> Not even sure that part would require CSS.
[06:56:28] <decx> hehe that's right
[06:58:04] <BillCriswell> That's the only use case I can think of for images being inline elements by default.
[06:59:55] <BillCriswell> Otherwise I am always setting them block.
[07:00:28] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: what's the difference between $(this) and "this" (without $())
[07:00:43] <decx> this is this and $('this') is this in a jq object
[07:00:48] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: this is the raw dom element, this wrapped with $() is a jQuery object.
[07:00:53] <decx> $(this)*
[07:01:07] <Amnesia> ah ok
[07:01:20] <Amnesia> ty
[07:01:21] <decx> this is not always a raw dom element
[07:01:36] <BillCriswell> decx: True.
[07:01:45] <decx> dare i say i most cases it isnt
[07:01:45] <BillCriswell> Usually?
[07:01:46] <decx> :>
[07:01:53] <BillCriswell> decx: What would it be usually?
[07:02:03] <BillCriswell> I might just be using the wrong terminology.
[07:02:18] <decx> function context?
[07:02:31] <decx> dont ask me about terminology
[07:02:35] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[07:02:40] <decx> i'm just winging it here
[07:02:55] <Amnesia> dafuq:P
[07:03:12] <BillCriswell> Well... with jQuery I feel like most the time it's a dom element unless it's in ajax or animation stuff.
[07:03:19] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[07:03:31] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: so why does the inner filter callback return the length?
[07:03:31] <BillCriswell> I know how to use it usually is all I know haha
[07:03:48] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Just something truthy to know that filter should return that element.
[07:04:03] <decx> technically this is window most of the time ;D
[07:04:10] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: well, when I ommit it, everything gets matched:)
[07:04:41] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Yes. Because $() will always be true. Have to look at lenght.
[07:05:03] <Amnesia> I see
[07:05:05] <BillCriswell> Doing return $('input').filter().length > 0; would probably be clearer.
[07:05:20] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Well, in a truthy / flasey sense.
[07:05:24] <BillCriswell> See, this is why I shouldn't talk.
[07:05:29] <Amnesia> yeah I guess it makes sense now:)
[07:05:31] <decx> no need for > 0
[07:05:38] <Amnesia> since $ has been defined by jquery:)
[07:05:49] <BillCriswell> decx: I didn't use it, but was just trying to be more explicit.
[07:06:24] <decx> i use still use length > 0 out of habit all the time
[07:06:28] <decx> .-.
[07:07:47] <Amnesia> next challenge, filter tr's that contains two inputs with specified values:D
[07:07:58] <Amnesia> ty for your time btw decx/BillCriswell
[07:08:05] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: No problem.
[07:08:38] <BillCriswell> Second thing shouldn't be too bad knowing that you can't use attribute selectors on the value PROPERTY and you know about .filter()
[07:08:57] <decx> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).find('input[value='blah']').length > 1 })
[07:08:59] <decx> or something
[07:09:20] <decx> "blah" even
[07:09:25] <decx> dat doublequote nightmare
[07:09:39] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, works if the value on the input hasn't been touched.
[07:10:10] <decx> checking val and length would make it a bit too involved for one line
[07:10:16] <decx> ^^
[07:10:17] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[07:10:50] <onethfour> What is the best way to clone a tr and then insert it next
[07:11:25] <BillCriswell> $(this).clone().after(this); ?
[07:11:42] <decx> var mytr = $('.mytr'); mytr.after(mytr.clone())
[07:12:35] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: http://paste.debian.net/107027/
[07:12:43] <DelphiWorld> its not changing
[07:14:17] <BillCriswell> decx: You say potato.
[07:14:25] <decx> i dont think yours works?
[07:14:55] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: You have <select name="langs"> but the code is looking for <select name="lang"> without the S.
[07:15:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Hmm... let me see.
[07:15:10] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: just discovered! :P
[07:15:21] <decx> BillCriswell :
[07:15:25] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Y6u2R/
[07:16:21] <BillCriswell> decx: I meant insertAfter
[07:16:53] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/riciragu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:17:14] <decx> hehe
[07:17:16] <decx> salvaged it
[07:17:30] <BillCriswell> decx: I actually didn't mean that, just switched it when I realized it didn't work.
[07:17:32] <BillCriswell> Shhhhhhhh
[07:17:54] <decx> have a bunch of straight lines http://jsfiddle.net/decx/sq3tE/
[07:18:09] <BillCriswell> decx: Teach me math.
[07:18:23] <decx> anything going beyond 10 is a magic
[07:18:33] <BillCriswell> I'm already lost.
[07:19:10] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: same, but still not switching
[07:19:32] <DelphiWorld> oh wait
[07:19:37] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Is the chang eveent firing? Try putting an alert() or something in there.
[07:20:07] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: lol hold, maybe cache in browser... killing & restarting
[07:21:16] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: where you want me to put alert
[07:21:34] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: The callback for the change event.
[07:21:51] <BillCriswell> $('select').on('change', function() { alert('Yes, I am working');}); like that.
[07:21:55] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: alert 'hi!'; ?
[07:22:08] <Radditz> decx: prop.attr('checked') trigger the click function
[07:22:22] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Need the ()
[07:22:31] <decx> prop.attr() really?
[07:22:36] <decx> really
[07:22:37] <Radditz> yes
[07:22:43] <BillCriswell> Really?
[07:22:47] <Radditz> I just tested, yes
[07:22:55] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: text to speech dont read (), so needed to manualy scrol to read ;)
[07:23:14] <BillCriswell> Open Parenthesis, Close parenthesis... hopefully I spelled that right.
[07:23:45] <grkblood13> I'm having trouble listening to event on dynamically added elements with append. How do I access these events? In the following example I want h1 to change when textareas are clicked. http://jsfiddle.net/BRwfX/
[07:23:46] <BillCriswell> Radditz: Can you show us in a demo?
[07:23:47] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: yep dont wory when i move right & left i can heare the simbols
[07:23:58] <Radditz> BillCriswell: I am still trying to figure out what is going on
[07:23:59] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Nice.
[07:25:08] <Radditz> BillCriswell: something is wrong, I don't understand what tho
[07:25:18] <decx> neither attr nor prop trigger a click, reproduce your thing
[07:25:18] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: in term of view, its good to put the language selector in top?
[07:25:33] <Radditz> it seems to trigger it tho
[07:25:41] <Radditz> BillCriswell: that may take a time to create, such demo
[07:25:56] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: top... === (HEADER)
[07:26:06] <decx> it doesnt http://jsfiddle.net/decx/b86KK/
[07:27:38] <onethfour> thanks
[07:28:04] <onethfour> is there a way to change all my inputs after I clone the tr
[07:28:52] <decx> change to what
[07:29:49] <grkblood13> anyone?
[07:30:37] <decx> the textarea you append doesnt exist when you use on click
[07:30:43] <decx> delegate before you generate
[07:30:58] <BillCriswell> Boyyeeee
[07:31:32] <decx> like this a
[07:31:42] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BRwfX/2/
[07:31:48] <decx> my clipboard is broken today
[07:31:56] <decx> boyyeee indeed
[07:32:18] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: pastebining new code
[07:32:43] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: http://paste.debian.net/107030/
[07:33:31] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Are you getting the alert?
[07:33:48] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: now yes, but the content of that div "home" is empty
[07:34:12] <decx> who thought that pink was a good primary color
[07:34:33] <treehau55> hello, when I give the success: option in the $.ajax two functions, the second functions  seems to get called regardless of whether it was an actuall success or not.
[07:34:42] <treehau55> this does not seem correct to me
[07:34:44] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: The code you have is looking for an element with an id that matches, not a class.
[07:34:53] <BillCriswell> Wait I lied.
[07:35:01] <BillCriswell> #('.' + id) is just confusing lol
[07:35:11] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: so suggest?
[07:35:13] <decx> :O
[07:35:21] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: What does the XML file look like?
[07:35:34] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell:  hold off:P
[07:36:49] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: http://paste.debian.net/107033/
[07:37:56] <Bray90820> I am doing a lightbox and it is telling m to define an href for every image of the set but correct me if i am wrong wouldn't that show each image on the page
[07:38:03] <Bray90820> Or would it just show one image for the set
[07:38:10] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: It seems like it should work. I'd need to play around with it a bit and look for the common causes of issues.
[07:38:28] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: i changed class to id now but still no result:P
[07:38:30] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Ph wait.
[07:38:36] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: No you did want class.
[07:38:48] <decx> Bray90820 that would just add a link
[07:38:50] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: i didnt yet past the new code lol
[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: The value attribures inside the HTML select should be en, ar and tur
[07:39:14] <BillCriswell> not the whole language name.
[07:39:26] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell:  mean?
[07:39:51] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: <en>Hello there, how are you?</en>
[07:40:01] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: <select name="langs"><option value="en">English</option></select> and not <select name="langs"><option value="English">en</option></select>
[07:40:09] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: <ar>arabic</ar> is just a false translation test
[07:40:22] <DelphiWorld> oh
[07:40:25] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: I mean in your HTML, not the XML.
[07:40:29] <Bray90820> decx: would it need it to be linked to another image in the page or what?
[07:40:39] <BillCriswell> this.value would be what's in the value attribute, not between the option tags.
[07:40:51] <decx> Bray90820 jquery lightbox 2?
[07:41:21] <Bray90820> 2.7 but yes
[07:41:31] <decx> it needs a set of links to big images to initialize a set, depending on the lightbox you can feed it an array of urls as well
[07:42:43] <Bray90820> So i don't need thumbnails for EVERY image just the one for the set right?
[07:42:59] <decx> you dont NEED thumbnails at all
[07:43:15] <Bray90820> Well i need something to click on
[07:43:51] <treehau55> when I give $.ajax success option two callback functions, the second one gets executed regardless of an actual success everytime, why is that?
[07:44:23] <DelphiWorld> no... no result BillCriswell
[07:45:14] <Amnesia> hm, sorry to bother you once again, but how would I be able to filter a tr that contains two specific inputs?
[07:45:20] <systemfault> treehau55: No code, no help.. paste your code on jsfiddle.net
[07:45:52] <Amnesia> the previous example actually had one single condition, but I'm somehow looking for a way to have to conditions
[07:46:33] <treehau55> I dont need to paste, its pretty simple $.ajax({ url: 'whatever/whatever/', success: [this.firstCallBack, this.secondCallback] })  secondCallback is always executed
[07:47:46] <DelphiWorld> yooooooooooo systemfault !
[07:48:01] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: Hey :D
[07:49:08] <michael_mbp> hi all
[07:49:19] <michael_mbp> could someone help m with this please https://gist.github.com/bsodmike/94bd8630533db361648a
[07:49:20] <slax0r> hi you
[07:49:22] <DelphiWorld> michael_mbp: hello mr mavrics
[07:49:29] <michael_mbp> hey slax0r
[07:49:45] <systemfault> treehau55: Even if the transaction fails?
[07:49:47] <michael_mbp> I tried setting a global var, assigning to that, setting a var on window, assigning to that; no luck.
[07:50:05] <slax0r> because it's async
[07:50:17] <michael_mbp> slax0r: ...!!!
[07:50:21] <slax0r> readImage will be processed before onload fires, most probably
[07:50:27] <michael_mbp> obv, that's a callback.
[07:50:35] <michael_mbp> what if I use a promise?
[07:50:56] <systemfault> michael_mbp: Doesn’t change anything.
[07:50:58] <slax0r> then don't use a return, have onload do what you would do with the readImage return
[07:51:34] <michael_mbp> slax0r: this is being called from another jquery event btw.
[07:51:48] <treehau55> systematik: no, if the transaction fails, nothing happens, but if the status code is anything between 200 - 400, it calls it. I also have a dummy error call back, which just console.log's the status, and that, in addition to the second callback in success are being executed
[07:51:59] <slax0r> michael_mbp: so?
[07:52:11] <michael_mbp> slax0r: I want that event to receive that info.
[07:52:36] <michael_mbp> so right now I'm one callback inside another.
[07:52:58] <systemfault> treehau55: I’m having a hard time understanding what you expect… if you pass an array to “success”, ALL the handlers are going to be called one after the other.
[07:53:31] <treehau55> systematik: even if its not a success?
[07:53:45] <systemfault> treehau55: No, if it fails, it shouldn’t be called.
[07:54:03] <treehau55> systematik: okay well thats exactly what I am saying is happening. The second function is being called
[07:54:13] <treehau55> systematik: regardless of whether its a failure
[07:54:38] <treehau55> systematik: the first function is not being called, but the second function is. If I add a third, that too gets called.
[07:55:17] <systemfault> treehau55: Strange… I know it’s not a solution but as a workaround, you could try to use the promise interface.
[07:55:39] <treehau55> treehau55: that is what I was thinking, or just annon function inside success and explicit check the status code
[07:56:13] <treehau55> systematik: I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this before because that seems like its not how its suppose to work
[07:59:18] <systemfault> treehau55: I never used the success +  array syntax ever :/ Started using the more flexible promise interface once it was released. What is your jQuery version BTW?
[07:59:31] <treehau55> systematik: the promise interface also seems to call the function incorrectly. I am now wondering if this is a problem with the rest endpoint I am using that is somehow confusing jquery
[07:59:57] <treehau55> systematik: 1.11.1
[08:00:00] <systemfault> Latest.
[08:00:10] <Tomashe> Hey guys i want to ajax request to retry if fail...
[08:00:13] <Amnesia> question, using the following: https://privatepaste.com/17ddfe5517 how would I be able to filter rules that have inputs with the values a AND b ?
[08:00:29] <Tomashe> so i was wondering if i can .fail() { run my function again of the ajax ..}
[08:00:31] <Tomashe> will that work?
[08:03:18] <systemfault> Tomashe: You could probably write a nice function with promises to do it.
[08:04:09] <[1]domino> hello
[08:04:50] <[1]domino> anyone can help with XMLHttpRequest and php://input
[08:05:43] <systemfault> [1]domino: I would try the PHP channel
[08:06:35] <[1]domino> i think the problem is just set the right contet-type in the request
[08:06:50] <[1]domino> xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type',  'application/form-data');

[08:42:42] <ciqsteve> the style stays on the element until the function exits, then it disappears... ??
[08:42:51] <ciqsteve> cant think of why it would do that
[08:42:59] <ngirot> Is it possible that Sizzle getText fn have really bad Perf on IE8 ?
[08:43:45] <decx> doesnt everything?
[08:44:08] <ciqsteve> thoughts / ideas greatly appreciated
[08:44:12] <ciqsteve> :)
[08:44:47] <duch_kazatel> getText shouldn't be too bad.  ngirot what selector are you using?
[08:44:51] <decx> what's that supposed to be ciqsteve a fixed nav?
[08:45:33] <ciqsteve> I have a scroll with a header that needs to 'stop' at the top.. but not at the top of the viewport, as there is a permanent header
[08:45:40] <ciqsteve> so I need it to position just below it
[08:45:53] <ciqsteve> I don't want to hard code the size of the header
[08:46:04] <ciqsteve> the permanent heaer
[08:46:05] <ciqsteve> header
[08:46:10] <ngirot> duch_kazatel, i use contains and text() on object already selected before. But i use this function many time and in IE8 debugger i have very poor perf on getText
[08:46:52] <ngirot> duch_kazatel, i make my own function with innerText for ie and it's really better
[08:47:21] <ciqsteve> decx- so I'm positioning an element to sit right below the nav mar
[08:47:23] <ciqsteve> bar
[08:47:24] <duch_kazatel> can you show us a jsperf proving that or showing the issue, ngirot?
[08:47:27] <ciqsteve> or at least trying to
[08:48:22] <ngirot> duch_kazatel, mmh. I can do that this week maybe. Are you here all the time :p ?
[08:48:31] <duch_kazatel> almost every weekday :)
[08:48:50] <arschmitz> ngirot: what version of jQuery
[08:49:17] <arschmitz> ngirot: there were some major improvements to that function a while back
[08:49:18] <ngirot> the last of branch 1.x
[08:50:30] <ngirot> arschmitz, i can make some test this weekend to be more specific
[08:50:58] <ngirot> arschmitz, and i come back with

[09:16:14] <qiller> hi friends, can i sum 65 + 65 each mouse click using: $('body').stop().animate({ scrollTop: 65}, 500);
[09:16:50] <duch_kazatel> qiller not like that,'
[09:17:09] <qiller> duch_kazatel: when i use it, scrollTop 65, its 65 only and stop
[09:17:25] <qiller> i want go to 65 + 65 + 65 etc, each click
[09:17:28] <duch_kazatel> right.  you need to store a variable that persists that value.
[09:17:56] <duch_kazatel> and then do theVar += 65, then animate using that variable.
[09:18:02] <BillCriswell> Dam. Almost dozed off there.
[09:18:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you asleep?
[09:18:30] <duch_kazatel> it's friday

[09:21:47] <BillCriswell> Fuck man.
[09:21:52] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha

[09:23:36] <decx> what is that, birdflu?
[09:23:42] <umberleigh> hi. i'm using .load() to put content in a div in the keyup() event. is there any way to only execute the last request if the user presses the key multiple times in short succession?
[09:23:50] <decx> swolen brain
[09:24:16] <Katharsis> http://wklej.to/yw6tR
[09:24:35] <decx> it's called debounce Katharsis
[09:24:41] <Katharsis> it works on Chrome
[09:25:02] <Katharsis> decx: ?
[09:25:28] <decx> there are several helper functions availabe to alleviate that problem, the technique is called debouncing
[09:25:39] <decx> google that
[09:27:08] <Katharsis> why I need $.debounce or other libs for that?
[09:27:19] <Katharsis> my function works on Google Chrome
[09:27:27] <decx> it's not a lib, it's just a timeout
[09:27:36] <Katharsis> I know, I read about it
[09:27:44] <umberleigh> decx: well, that's rather fortunate timing. seems to answer my question too
[09:27:52] <umberleigh> thanks
[09:27:54] <Katharsis> but don't understand why it works on Chrome and not on Firefox
[09:28:03] <decx> ha!

[09:28:38] <Katharsis> ;)
[09:28:48] * umberleigh facepalms
[09:29:18] <decx> i had that problem with a captcha though Katharsis
[09:29:35] <decx> i think yslow was the culprit
[09:30:01] <Katharsis> decx: i see that post and get request works (on debug level), but don't understand why image not refresh
[09:30:37] <decx> maybe add a randomized parameter to your request?
[09:31:25] <Katharsis> decx: i can but what for?
[09:31:49] <AusME> I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to JQuery and JavaScript. I've got a click event being registered twice. The result is the getTemplatesFromPackageReboundFromPackageSetId() is being called twice when it shouldn't. I've looked at the code for an hour or so and I can't see any way that the method from within the JS can call the function twice. So it must be JQuery, but I don't know why or how. JS here http://pastebin.com/2hFqayvp If anyone has a chance to loo
[09:31:56] <Katharsis> placeholders and class changes like I want it
[09:32:08] <Katharsis> but image is still the same
[09:32:10] <AusME> I'm currently trying to put this in JSFiddle but the HTML is very beefy.
[09:33:42] <AusME> Actually JSFiddle doesn't make any sense since I'm using an AJAX call which is only on Localhost.
[09:34:41] <systemfault> AusME: line 48 and 77 perhaps.
[09:35:16] <AusME> Those, I thought, were necessary to tell JQuery to set the click event on that link to that function?
[09:35:46] <AusME> and I've put alerts near them and 48 only gets called once (the document is only ready once).
[09:36:03] <AusME> and 77 isn't calling getTemplatesFromPackageReboundFromPackageSetId().
[09:42:01] <zizzl> Hey guys I want to have a "view more" button show more items.. Is there a way I can only show the first, say 9 items, and have the view more button show the rest?
[09:42:13] <zizzl> just not sure how to specify amount of divs in jquery
[09:42:25] <decx> there's a plethora of ways to go about this
[09:42:42] <tyrionlanister> using this menu http://tympanus.net/Development/ResponsiveMultiLevelMenu/ how would I reset the menu and close it after clicking the menu link
[09:43:41] <elzid_> hi all, Im opening a modal window using jqueryui dialog and loading an iframe of an external site in it. The 3rd party site once completed its processing redirects to another site within the dialog, at which point I need to close the modal window and refresh the parent window - does anyone have any idea of how to achieve this?
[09:45:38] <elzid_>  If I understand correctly, because the final page isn't the page that opened the modal dialog, I can't issue a close to it?
[09:47:08] <zizzl> decx you talking to me?
[09:47:32] <zizzl> I see that I can get the number of child items with .length ...
[09:47:50] <decx> yes zizzl sorry i always forget to add the name, that lack of irc nettiquette -.-
[09:48:58] <decx> you can hide children from a certain position onwards, you can stick your optional children in a wrapper that you toggle and i bet there's 10 other ways
[09:50:12] <zizzl> decx you keep telling me how many ways there are, that doesn't help haha
[09:50:24] <zizzl> so can I set the length of the child elements?
[09:50:27] <zizzl> I know how to pull it
[09:50:29] <decx> i'm writing an example as well :>
[09:50:34] <decx> don't go that way
[09:52:27] <elzid_> guys can I close a modal dialog from another page that did not open the modal dialog in the first instance?
[09:53:10] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:53:30] <duch_kazatel> "guys can i control one page from another arbitrarily?"
[09:54:56] <decx> zizzl here's one way http://jsfiddle.net/decx/t2Dg5/
[09:55:16] <elzid_> so how can I get around the issue where a modal dialog loads an external page, which then redirects back to my page, which loads *within* the dialog, but I need the dialog closed and the page to be loaded on the parent page - this is a common usecase no?
[09:55:25] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ wut
[09:55:32] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ modal, or popup?
[09:55:44] <elzid_> .dialog modal:true
[09:55:59] <elzid_> @duch_kazatel: from jqueryui
[09:56:05] <zizzl> decx, sorry maybe I didn't make it clear, but I already have the child elements loaded
[09:56:24] <decx> i know that's why i commented // actual start
[09:56:30] <zizzl> they're dynamically pulling child pages sort of like how a blog would work, just pulls the thumbnails and titles etc..
[09:56:32] <decx> i'm not going to write 50 divs by hand :D
[09:56:35] <duch_kazatel> something here smells funny to me.  you're opening a modal, which "loads" a page (this an iframe?  ajax?), but it sounds like what you really want is to send the user to a different page.
[09:57:01] <decx> the actual thing is the filter&toggle
[09:57:59] <elzid_> @duch_kazatel - yeah its loading an iframe, my only goal is to present an external page, think PCI compliant credit card page, which the user completes and submits and processor then returns the user to another page on my site
[09:58:12] <elzid_> but this is loading within the modal - is that the wrong approach?
[09:58:30] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ that is entirely the wrong approach imo.  we're PCI complaint and don't do anything like that.
[09:58:39] <duch_kazatel> if you need to ship them elsewhere, do that.
[09:59:02] <UDD_2> hi
[09:59:05] <elzid_> @duch_kazatel - we're not PCI compliant, hence we load a compliant CC processing page
[09:59:22] <UDD_2> i am used monthpicker
[09:59:32] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ drop the @ btw :) my client notifies me when you mention my name.  putting the @ in front breaks that :)
[09:59:38] <duch_kazatel> and you need to not use a dialog for that.
[09:59:40] <duch_kazatel> ship them to the page.
[09:59:42] <decx> happy to meet you used monthpicker
[09:59:43] <duch_kazatel> let them come back.
[09:59:57] <duch_kazatel> decx nonono - he IS a "used" monthpicker
[09:59:58] <decx> what an odd first and last name though
[10:00:02] <duch_kazatel> very zen
[10:00:02] <decx> ^^
[10:00:10] <elzid_> sorry
[10:00:33] <duch_kazatel> no need to apologize.  newer folks usually don't know that
[10:00:33] <UDD_2> with jquery and try 'blocks'  month  but i have a error : ' undefined apply'
[10:00:34] <UDD_2> http://jsfiddle.net/HXwBv/2/
[10:00:50] <elzid_> ok, but how do I keep the page under the theme of the site? loading an iframe presents the same issue?
[10:00:53] <duch_kazatel> UDD_2 load the plugin via the "external resources" instead.
[10:01:14] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ the processor should have a way for you to do that.
[10:01:26] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ if you need to ship them elsewhere, do that.
[10:01:49] <duch_kazatel> but you lose the ability for a "theme" probably, unless they have a way for you to upload assets.
[10:01:50] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:02:08] <UDD_2> duch_kazatel, ok
[10:02:48] <elzid_> they can return the user, but isn't that a little unclean i.e. the user leaves the branded site, goes elsewhere completely and then returns... ideally I'd like to keep everything within my site by using something like a modal window - is that technically not possible?
[10:06:17] <UDD_2> duch_kazatel, you known server for upload file 'raw' '
[10:06:43] <UDD_2> is for linked in resource jsfiddle.net
[10:06:58] <Katharsis> decx: using base64 format fix my problem
[10:07:04] <zizzl> decx so should the divs var just be my wrapper?
[10:08:19] <decx> Katharsis firefoxs cache probably ignored ajaxes cache: false. makes sense that base64 would solve that. nicely done
[10:08:34] <decx> zizzl divs contains all the children that you want to control
[10:08:53] <UDD_2> in paste.debian.net duch_kazatel  :p
[10:10:31] <UDD_2> duch_kazatel, i have ok in http://jsfiddle.net/fdXc9/1/
[10:11:24] <decx> what's monthpicker anyway?
[10:11:40] <decx> is that like datepicker but not as datey?
[10:12:16] <UDD_2> in "console debug from browser" when i change for example of 2000 later 2014  want 'block' the month , but in event onchange : "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined "'
[10:12:27] <zizzl> decx looks like you have it as (childelemtns,parentelement) no?
[10:12:48] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ not in the way you want.
[10:12:53] <duch_kazatel> sorry I was away.
[10:12:53] <UDD_2> decx, http://lucianocosta.info/jquery.mtz.monthpicker/
[10:13:02] <decx> zizzl yes that's just syntax flavor, same as parent.find(descendant)
[10:13:36] <duch_kazatel> elzid_ you need to either do an actual integration or give up on your theming :
[10:14:05] <decx> in this context parent.children() would be the same, point is, all your items are inside a var that you can filter through easily
[10:14:12] <UDD_2> the last example page 'disable' the months, but this no work for my
[10:14:23] <zizzl> decx so this is ok?? var divs = $('.work_thumb','#work-items');
[10:14:42] <decx> if you want to use that syntax yes
[10:15:16] <elzid_> duch_kazatel - ok, many thanks for your time
[10:15:40] <Katharsis> decx: yea, but captcha_image.attr("src", "/captcha.png?timestamp=" + new Date().getTime()); works too ;)
[10:16:10] <decx> Katharsis i guess firefox doest care about your cache: false if it's a picture request
[10:17:00] <zizzl> decx awesome thanks
[10:17:13] <zizzl> lastly what would I use if I don't want it to toggle
[10:17:28] <decx> you can toggle a class and do whatever
[10:17:31] <decx> with css
[10:17:36] <zizzl> I'm gonna hide the button after the click which I can do, but wondering what i need to take off the toggle option
[10:17:50] <zizzl> well no I just want it to view more and then thats it
[10:18:12] <decx> that would probably require a little rewrite
[10:18:27] <decx> because we hide them first with the trigger('click')
[10:20:20] <decx> if you just want to show then you can lose the whole filter
[10:23:11] <zizzl> decx hmm alright
[10:24:07] <decx> zizzl http://jsfiddle.net/decx/t2Dg5/2/
[10:26:14] <zizzl> decx you're hte man
[10:26:16] <zizzl> the
[10:26:35] <decx> heroic truthiness expert
[10:26:37] <BillCriswell> He's all right.
[10:26:51] <zizzl> hahah
[10:27:19] <zizzl> I always thought $('elem','elem') was just used if you wanted multiple elements
[10:27:29] <zizzl> didn't know it was for child/parent
[10:27:52] <duch_kazatel> zizzl in that case, yes.  you're thinking of  $('elem, elem')
[10:28:05] <zizzl> ahh ok
[10:28:12] <decx> it's either that or making a flyer for an agriculture firm
[10:28:13] <zizzl> is there docs on the previous one?
[10:28:20] <decx> i'm not in the mood to illustrate a cow
[10:28:21] <zizzl> well I know there are, can you tell me what to search
[10:29:14] <decx> zizzl https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-selector-context
[10:29:22] <decx> that's what it's called, selector context
[10:30:17] <Amnesia> decx: could you tell me how I can use a callback in conjuction with the filter function to filter stuff based on two conditions?
[10:30:53] <decx> you can put as many conditions in there as you like
[10:31:10] <decx> BillCriswell is the filter expert here ^^
[10:32:38] <ChocoPants> filter experttttt
[10:32:44] <Amnesia> decx: https://privatepaste.com/ec25ddbeb6 thats the code
[10:33:19] <BillCriswell> I love filterzing
[10:33:28] <Amnesia> orly:D?
[10:33:29] <duch_kazatel> filterification
[10:33:42] <decx> Amnesia http://jsfiddle.net/decx/wubbm/
[10:34:15] <Amnesia> *click*
[10:34:46] <Amnesia> decx: yeah, I've tried that aswell
[10:35:05] <Amnesia> point is, I want to filter all tr's that contain inputs that matched the value of "pname" and "act"
[10:35:41] <Amnesia> and "return this.value === pname || this.value === act is an or
[10:35:58] <Amnesia> but obviously "return this.value === pname && this.value === act" doesn't make sense
[10:36:37] <BillCriswell> What's wrong with using the or?
[10:37:26] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: well, from how I understand it, the or would select tr's that contain an input with an input with the value 'pname' OR act
[10:37:52] <Amnesia> and what I'm trying to do, is filter out all tr that have got two inputs in which the first one has the value 'pname' and the second one 'act'
[10:38:04] <BillCriswell> Ohhhh.
[10:38:06] <decx> but when you filter you go through each separately
[10:38:14] <decx> so or is right
[10:38:15] <Amnesia> decx: yep, exactly
[10:38:42] <Amnesia> that's why I used the pname_matched variable
[10:43:09] <decx> i conveniently left the apartment to bring down garbage, only to not have to look at that double filter myself, get to it BillCriswell ;>
[10:44:11] <Amnesia> heh
[10:44:22] <Amnesia> it actually does feel like inception:P
[10:44:51] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: Put the values you want to match into an array, the remove that item from the array as you come across that value, when that array is empty return true;
[10:47:02] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: hm, isn't that the same as what I'm doing with the boolean?
[10:47:03] <Automatik> hi
[10:47:38] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: http://jsbin.com/fucoveli/2/edit?js,output this basically.
[10:47:47] <BillCriswell> I didn't text it though.. think I'm using splice right haha
[10:48:23] <decx> inventive
[10:48:49] <Automatik> why an instruction like
[10:48:49] <Automatik> $.ajax(url)
[10:48:49] <Automatik>     .done( function(jqXHR) {
[10:48:49] <Automatik>         alert(jqXHR.responseText);
[10:48:49] <Automatik>     });
[10:48:50] <Automatik> doesn't return the text from the server?
[10:49:24] <decx> i wanted to help and then you pasted 4 lines, now i am obliged to hate you
[10:49:26] <sumperson> missing brackets?
[10:49:34] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[10:50:04] <GnuBoi> how i link the text in column header in data table to some a link other area than text to sort the column?
[10:50:32] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: http://jsbin.com/fucoveli/3/edit?html,js,output
[10:50:45] <Amnesia> BillCriswell: ty, I'll have a look at it
[10:51:30] <BillCriswell> decx: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/ I read through this, and didn't understand like any of the words, but I think it made me smarter.
[10:52:40] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: No problem.
[10:52:48] <BillCriswell> Now you have a solution if you even want to add more values.
[10:52:50] <BillCriswell> or less values.
[10:52:58] <Automatik> here is the pasted code (sorry) : http://pastebin.com/MfQg4yms ; where missing brackets furthermore?
[10:53:41] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: You could even break that each when the values array is empty to speed it up a bit.
[10:53:58] <Amnesia> interesting..
[10:54:13] <Amnesia> I'm diving into it atm, sorry for my slow response^^
[10:55:20] <BillCriswell> No worries.
[10:55:35] <Hacym> Hi, I am pretty new to jQuery but had a quick question... Is there an easy way to use toggle in an inline onClick and toggle everything else in the div off? So for example, I have three columns, the first with links, the second will change based on what the click in the first, and then the third will change based on what they click in the second... But I want to make it so that only one div in the second column will show at a time
[10:55:42] <Hacym> as well as the third column
[10:58:22] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: http://jsbin.com/fucoveli/4/edit?js,output that's howy you'd get out early.
[10:58:43] <Amnesia> ty
[11:01:21] <GnuBoi> Hey folks, how i link the text in column header in data table to some a link other area than text to sort the column?
[11:02:17] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: No problem.
[11:03:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Pretty hypnotizing, eh?
[11:05:10] <decx> what is?
[11:05:19] <BillCriswell> The link I showed you earlier.
[11:05:28] <BillCriswell> "decx: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/ I read through this, and didn't understand like any of the words, but I think it made me smarter."
[11:05:47] <decx> ah, just came back into the room
[11:05:54] <decx> yeah i read that yesterday on hn
[11:05:56] <decx> ^^
[11:06:15] <BillCriswell> I felt pretty dumb throughout.
[11:06:40] <decx> hehe
[11:06:45] <decx> agreed
[11:08:04] <Amnesia> hm, it's not working yet, but I'll work it out, ty for your time once again
[11:08:10] <Amnesia> http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/ <- interesting read btw
[11:08:58] <decx> what a waste, there is no boll subdomain on there
[11:09:08] <Automatik> an answer?
[11:10:34] <BillCriswell> Amnesia: It's working in the demo I posted.
[11:10:49] <Amnesia> yep, I bet something else's wrong in my own code:)
[11:11:08] <BillCriswell> Oh haha.
[11:12:03] <hcker2000> any one know how I could use a promise and done methods on a foreach to know when it has finished?
[11:12:22] <decx> foreach isnt async
[11:12:44] <hcker2000> decx, ahh ok so I can just plop my code after it then
[11:12:54] <decx> indeed
[11:13:10] <hcker2000> decx, just curious is there a way to for each that is async?
[11:13:31] <decx> life will find a way so probably
[11:13:39] <decx> but i don't have an example
[11:13:46] <hcker2000> decx, fair enough
[11:20:52] <BillCriswell> hcker2000: I think you want when() with an array of promises.
[11:21:11] <BillCriswell> Not sure decx was following you right haha
[11:23:40] <decx> maybe, maybe not
[11:26:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[11:26:42] <decx> either way http://i.imgur.com/otxPZjf.gif
[11:27:23] <decx> man i fucked up somewhere
[11:27:27] <decx> whatever

[11:29:11] <thebope> hahaha
[11:29:52] <thebope> "So you guys... you guys dig up jquery functions?"
[11:30:48] <decx> i actually use mootools http://i.imgur.com/l7NDr9Y.png
[11:31:33] <Xliff> decx: What is that? A big mound of moo poop?
[11:31:48] <decx> thats the js garbage collector
[11:32:03] <thebope> lol
[11:33:37] <duch_kazatel> mootools :(
[11:34:05] <duch_kazatel> some beautiful things going on in here today though.
[11:34:07] <decx> there, fixed it http://i.imgur.com/8QqMaec.gif
[11:34:26] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[11:34:30] <Xliff> Heh.
[11:34:40] <Xliff> What beautiful things, duch_kazatel?
[11:34:47] <thebope> oh man it's all over
[11:34:48] <decx> well i'm here
[11:34:49] <decx> so
[11:34:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah basically.
[11:34:59] <duch_kazatel> if decx is here i feel comforted.
[11:35:04] <thebope> the ##javascript channel is pretty humorous right now too
[11:35:08] <decx> i'm like a pillow
[11:35:12] <decx> in shape and function
[11:35:22] <Automatik> how can i have the result from this request : '//fr.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=mangues&action=raw&templates=expand' please? I tried many methods but none works
[11:35:28] <Xliff> decx: I had no idea you were so soothing.
[11:35:45] <hazardous> Automatik what are you trying to do
[11:36:04] <Automatik> retrieve a raw text of a wiki page
[11:36:11] <hazardous> in.. what
[11:36:17] <decx> ♪ it's business, it's business time ♪
[11:36:18] <hazardous> you can't do that in 100% client side js
[11:36:34] <hazardous> it's not your domain
[11:36:43] <duch_kazatel> and they probably don't allow cross-site.
[11:36:47] <Xliff> I'ts not his domain and it's not JSONP
[11:36:53] <duch_kazatel> so?
[11:37:05] <hazardous> they don't have CORS headers, it's not his domain, and it's not jsonp
[11:37:09] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[11:37:10] <hcker2000> ok sill js question I want to do a case insensitve .search on a string which I know is .search(/termhere/i)
[11:37:10] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:37:18] <hcker2000> how could I replace termhere with a variable
[11:37:41] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 check out the regexp object.
[11:37:42] <BillCriswell> hcker2000: .indexOf(var.toLowerCase())
[11:38:04] <duch_kazatel> or if you just need to see if it's in there, do BillCriswell's solution.
[11:38:42] <hcker2000> BillCriswell, let me give that a go does it return the same thing as .search?
[11:39:01] <duch_kazatel> nope.  indexof and regex are distinct, hcker2000
[11:39:12] <duch_kazatel> what are you currently using out of the regex?
[11:39:19] <hcker2000> duch_kazatel, is .search regex?
[11:39:19] <BillCriswell> Not sure, but it'll return something greater than -1 if it exists in the string.
[11:39:28] <hcker2000> and -1 if it dosnt exist?
[11:39:33] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:39:36] <duch_kazatel> and yep.
[11:40:19] <hcker2000> ok thats close
[11:40:27] <hcker2000> ups is not matching UPS though
[11:40:39] <Xliff> Case insensitive.
[11:40:44] <BillCriswell> hcker2000: Lowercase both.
[11:41:02] <hcker2000> ok thats what i figued. can I chain .toLowerCase().indexOf?
[11:41:09] <Xliff> So .toLowerCase().search(termvar.toLowerCase()
[11:41:17] <BillCriswell> Yesh.
[11:41:27] <hcker2000> perfect
[11:48:36] <Rawrrrrrrr> Hello, can someone take a look at this an help me figure out what is not working with it? It should just show and hide divs...
[11:48:47] <Rawrrrrrrr> http://pastebin.com/dBjW1hBC
[11:49:26] <duch_kazatel> what version of JQ?
[11:49:35] <Rawrrrrrrr> Me??
[11:49:38] <duch_kazatel> yes
[11:49:41] <Rawrrrrrrr> 1.4.4
[11:49:43] <duch_kazatel> setting up a fiddle to play with.
[11:49:44] <duch_kazatel> holy shit.
[11:49:52] <duch_kazatel> that version is ancient
[11:49:56] <duch_kazatel> can you use anything more recent?
[11:50:10] <Rawrrrrrrr> Sure. What version should I use?
[11:50:23] <ChocoPants> anything
[11:50:29] <duch_kazatel> most recent is 1.11.0 if you need to support old IE.
[11:50:39] <duch_kazatel> 2.1.0 if you dont.
[11:50:43] <Rawrrrrrrr> Gotcha. switched to that
[11:51:01] <duch_kazatel> also, don't use value attributes on lis, use data-* attributes instead.
[11:51:33] <duch_kazatel> and finally, you can't have more than one thing with a given ID.
[11:51:47] <duch_kazatel> your example has two divs with an ID of 1
[11:52:27] <Rawrrrrrrr> should be "category2"
[11:52:35] <Rawrrrrrrr> the first one
[11:52:36] <duch_kazatel> which should?
[11:52:40] <Rawrrrrrrr> ^
[11:52:47] <duch_kazatel> the first one what?
[11:53:02] <duch_kazatel> oh i see now.
[11:53:08] <Rawrrrrrrr> <div id="1"> <div id="1" style="display:none;">
[11:53:14] <Rawrrrrrrr> the first of those should be category2

[11:55:03] <decx> that's not valid sgml
[11:55:21] <decx> id and classes cant start with a number
[11:55:32] <duch_kazatel> in html5 they can.
[11:55:38] <decx> oh?

[11:56:12] <Automatik> but I can do it with an other js method, but I want to do it with $.ajax, more properly. So I misspoke. but why it's not my domain? I do this request on the site fr.wiktionary.org, in my console
[11:56:44] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Automatik

[11:59:49] <duch_kazatel> Automatik what version of jq are you using?
[12:00:09] <duch_kazatel> Automatik also, that url doesn't allow CORS.
[12:01:05] <hazardous> Automatik console is not browser domain restrictions
[12:01:41] <Automatik> and scratchpad?

[12:03:45] <duch_kazatel> who was it here that had that awesome toggle button with animations?
[12:04:05] <duch_kazatel> Rawrrrrrrr could you re-share the page code then?
[12:05:30] <BillCriswell> Dam duch_kazatel relax.

[12:07:53] <duch_kazatel> update and paste the new link ;)
[12:08:28] <Rawrrrrrrr> still that link but it's working in fiddle... which makes me think I just have an issue with my jquery include...
[12:08:29] <thebopeAFK> lol
[12:08:42] <thebopeAFK> Oh god this nick is but a lie
[12:08:50] <Automatik> now I tested the code directly from the server (the script is loaded by the server) and the alert return a blank string, but I don't understand why
[12:08:54] <duch_kazatel> Rawrrrrrrr hit the "update" button and copy/paste the new link.

[12:11:36] <Rawrrrrrrr> It works with the floats too though in the fiddle, just not my local copy
[12:11:47] <duch_kazatel> doesn't work with the floats in the fiddle for me.
[12:12:21] <Rawrrrrrrr> can you scroll all the way to the right in the display?
[12:12:41] <duch_kazatel> woah okay nvm
[12:12:56] <duch_kazatel> create a new pastebin with all of the page's code, then.
[12:13:55] <Rawrrrrrrr> http://pastebin.com/NQVaHmCL
[12:15:14] <duch_kazatel> okay, and your jquery file is in that same folder, and it's named just "jquery.js"?
[12:15:41] <Rawrrrrrrr> yes
[12:15:44] <duch_kazatel> oh, and put main.js after your jquery include.
[12:15:46] <Rawrrrrrrr> shows up in my developer tools
[12:16:19] <Rawrrrrrrr> did that, nothing.
[12:17:09] <duch_kazatel> i just copied that HTML to my desktop and created a file named jquery.js - everythng worked fine for me.
[12:17:30] <Rawrrrrrrr> soooooooo weird
[12:17:57] <Rawrrrrrrr> my jquery.js is the downloaded copy of jquery 1.11
[12:18:25] <duch_kazatel> what does your console report when you click on a link?
[12:18:55] <Rawrrrrrrr> nada
[12:19:55] <duch_kazatel> and you tried putting a console log after your click handler binding?
[12:20:03] <duch_kazatel> just to make sure that part is actually firing?
[12:22:07] <Rawrrrrrrr>     	console.log("test"); on line three of my main.js
[12:22:17] <duch_kazatel> and?
[12:22:23] <Rawrrrrrrr> Didn't do it...
[12:22:24] <Rawrrrrrrr> Weird

[12:40:06] <Whirl3d> I am trying to write a simple $.toDiv() function that converts any elements in a conversion table to divs (with recurse option).
[12:40:46] <Whirl3d> has anyone done this before? Is it a stupid idea? Any input?
[12:42:30] <Whirl3d> I tried to make the function more polymorphic by creating toType(targ,tbl,rec)
[12:43:03] <Whirl3d> then of course, $.fn.toType=function (tbl, rec)
[12:44:00] <thebope> fix bug... break something else... fix bug... break something else... fix bug... break something else
[12:44:19] <thebope> Systems that break the minute you need to do something with them that is slightly different
[12:44:19] <thebope> suck
[12:44:25] <thebope> jquery
[12:44:49] <thebope> jquery doesn't suck... just trying to make my statements on topic
[12:50:23] <tejas-manohar> yo
[12:50:51] <tejas-manohar> jquery in titanium?
[12:54:13] <jenia`> hello
[12:54:50] <jenia`> how do i load a page into the browser? that is, when I do a ajax call, sometimes the server returns a httprespoonseredirect 302 basically
[12:54:59] <jenia`> how do i catch it and redirect the user to the correct page?
[13:07:06] <NoiseEee> i don't get the issue jenia
[13:07:21] <NoiseEee> the ajax requests follows it correctly, no?
[13:18:40] <BillCriswell> Testing on iOS6... feels ancient.
[13:19:25] <BillCriswell> I do miss that shift key though.
[13:19:34] <NoiseEee> all my devices are iOS6
[13:20:36] <NoiseEee> 2nd gen ipad, iphone 4
[13:20:59] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Those are the devices I'm actually testing on haha.
[13:21:17] <NoiseEee> yeah i think you'd have to be nuts to put iOS7 on either of those
[13:21:34] <bfig> hello, how can I find all descendants that have a certain class?
[13:21:42] <BillCriswell> I still love the weight of the iPhone 4.
[13:21:55] <BillCriswell> bfig: $something.find('.foo');
[13:22:16] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: The iPHone 5 is a little too light weight for me.
[13:22:24] <bfig> it's not working, i need all descendants, direct or indirect
[13:22:28] <BillCriswell> I can't tell if it's in my pocket or not.
[13:22:31] <bfig> that only gives me the children
[13:23:03] <BillCriswell> bfig: That would give you all descendants.
[13:24:03] <BillCriswell> $ul.find('li') would get you all <li>s no matter how deep they're nested.
[13:24:36] <bfig> ahh sorry i was using .children
[13:25:01] <BillCriswell> I can see how you can typo .children() and .find() ;)
[13:25:14] <BillCriswell> They look almost identical.
[13:25:25] <BillCriswell> They both have an n!
[13:26:33] <jeffmjack> could somebody tell me why $('#myInput').on('submit') isn't working here? http://jsfiddle.net/p8rfB/
[13:28:29] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: The input doesn't get the submit event, the form does.
[13:28:46] <BillCriswell> Also, you have an error in the code.
[13:28:57] <BillCriswell> jeffmjack: http://jsfiddle.net/p8rfB/1/ would be it working.
[13:30:55] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: ah
[13:30:59] <jeffmjack> BillCriswell: thanks!
[13:34:20] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/23Ccf/ Could someone help me figure out why the comma is only being added on every second item instead of every 3rd like it should be?

[13:39:18] <ChocoPants> ok
[13:53:40] <kingjoffery> is this the correct way to get a link's title? $("#mapper a").data('title')
[13:54:03] <duch_lunch> .attr('title')
[13:54:09] <duch_lunch> .data() is for data attributes.
[13:55:43] <kingjoffery> duch_lunch: right, using .attr('title') console says undefined
[13:56:11] <duch_kazatel> okay.  that means you don't have a title attribute, or your selector is bad.
[13:57:40] <kingjoffery> duch_kazatel: well my link definitely has a title attribute, but not sure if the selector is working
[14:01:09] <kingjoffery> duch_kazatel:i have a nested submenu that i want to select. the menu has an id of mapper. should i use document.getElementById("mapper").attr('title') ?
[14:01:30] <BillCriswell> Laterrrrrrr
[14:01:38] <systemfault> kingjoffery: You’re mixing pure DOM and jQuery
[14:02:02] <systemfault> kingjoffery: With jQuery, you want $("#mapper").attr('title')
[14:02:07] <systemfault> If the idea is to get the title.
[14:02:59] <kingjoffery> yes but the mapper has list elements with the attr('title') not the selector element
[14:06:26] <shoky> then select the elements that do have the title attribute
[14:26:18] <Whirl3d> shoky! How are you?
[14:33:01] <kingjoffery> duch_kazatel:can you help me? im very close
[14:33:27] <kingjoffery> or anyone for that matter. here is a plunk http://plnkr.co/edit/a1W10tYH5QFk4WhrEFQj?p=preview
[14:34:00] <kingjoffery> I need the marker links to open for each item not just 1 as shown
[14:43:21] <shoky> heys Whirl3d. am oks thanks. sup with you
[14:43:30] <kingjoffery> why would this only work for the first link? http://plnkr.co/edit/a1W10tYH5QFk4WhrEFQj?p=preview
[14:45:38] <tiblock> Hi. I have question. I make button = $('<input type="button" id="mybtn">'); $('body').append(button); what is better, remember variable button and do bitton.remove() or do $('#mybtn').remove()? What is better?
[14:45:40] <Whirl3d> kingjoffery, did you try clearing the default anchor behavior on the click handler? e.preventDefault();
[14:46:37] <shoky> kingjoffery: first of all, you're adding 8 click handlers for each link
[14:46:42] <kingjoffery> Whirl3d: yes that didn't work
[14:47:13] <shoky> kingjoffery: calling .on('click'     adds an event listener, and you're calling that from inside "onEachFeature" thing which i guess is a loop of sorts.
[14:47:14] <kingjoffery> shoky: o__O so should i be using a .each() methdo
[14:47:48] <kingjoffery> shoky: yes onEachfeature loops every marker in the collection
[14:47:57] <shoky> so you're adding click listeners, multiple times
[14:48:11] <shoky> see how you're getting 8 logs for each click..
[14:49:29] <kingjoffery> shoky: no i have it now, the title wasn't matching
[14:49:47] <kingjoffery> you've helped your king well.
[14:50:38] <shoky> kingjoffery: yes that too
[14:51:08] <shoky> kingjoffery: this is better  http://plnkr.co/edit/calwzaVVzwBln4NhDnES?p=preview
[14:51:35] <shoky> there's probably a better way if you know the leaflet api better
[14:51:46] <djBuss> hey guys, how can I make sure that a when a user hit the tab key its not going to give focus to elements behind my lightbox ?
[14:51:50] <djBuss> like this http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals

[15:11:34] <dude94954> can anyone provide some insight?
[15:15:08] <decx> what do you expect it to do?
[15:15:26] <systemfault> lol. idiot.
[15:15:45] <systemfault> Love the 1) Ask a question 2) wait one minute 3) leaves
[15:15:47] <systemfault> pattern
[15:16:14] <Whirl3d> kingjoffery, how about this for a solution: http://plnkr.co/edit/calwzaVVzwBln4NhDnES?p=preview
[15:16:14] <decx> i should reenabled j/p messages
[15:16:35] <decx> but then again, being able to read the channel has it's advantages too
[15:16:39] <decx> its*
[15:16:43] <hifire> decx: i'm trying to get the offset of the element relative to the viewport
[15:16:46] <systemfault> decx: True :) What is your IRC client?
[15:17:01] <decx> i paid for mirc like 50 years ago so i still use it
[15:17:09] <systemfault> hifire: Don't ask a question and then change your nick...
[15:17:22] <systemfault> hifire: Else, we'll think you're an idiot for asking a question and then leave.
[15:17:33] <systemfault> hifire: http://jsfiddle.net/pK5ku/1/ Look at that
[15:17:53] <systemfault> hifire: Is that doing what you expect?
[15:18:52] <Whirl3d> kingjoffery, I can't get it to save the contents. so the text I pasted into a jsfiddle (IT DOES NOT WORK IN JSFIDDLE) but you could copy/paste to plink and it will work. Sorry, I have  to run
[15:19:46] <decx> hifire so you know you want the offset, how did you arrive at scrollTop() and not offset()
[15:21:51] <hifire> decx: offset is relative to the document, i want the offset relative to the viewport
[15:22:23] <hifire> systemfault: sorry went experimenting - i'm not trying to hook scoll event - just get the top and left position relative to the viewport
[15:22:25] <decx> you get offset and then substract scrollTop
[15:24:44] <hifire> decx: thx http://jsfiddle.net/pK5ku/2/
[15:27:49] <systemfault> decx: Would using .position instead of .offset make it easier or I miss something
[15:28:07] <systemfault> I mean, using .position, he wouldn't have to substract, no?
[15:28:13] <systemfault> Not sure..
[15:28:31] <decx> position is relative to the nearest parent that has a position property
[15:28:35] <decx> afaik
[15:38:38] <LeBlaaanc> Hey guys, how can I make the my .each() update the object it's foreaching? http://jsfiddle.net/WVt87/1/
[15:39:02] <LeBlaaanc> ( thought using $(this) would directly update the object but this isn't the case :(
[15:39:28] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the current object, not what jquery returned.
[15:39:33] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you can update it.
[15:40:06] <LeBlaaanc> Ah so not the current object in context of the other object?
[15:40:12] <LeBlaaanc> (seems odd)
[15:40:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:41:22] <LeBlaaanc> duch_kazatel: maybe a quick peak at the code (even just the giant comment I put) might be the best way to explain.

[15:41:56] <LeBlaaanc> Okay let me elaborate on your example even a bit.
[15:42:50] <ZP18> anyone here good at css?
[15:43:06] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 most of us are pretty cood, but ##css might be more help for that :)
[15:43:17] <ZP18> oh ok ty
[15:43:26] <ZP18> duch_kazatel: #css or ##css
[15:44:09] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 should be ##, but it might be just #
[15:44:38] <LeBlaaanc> duch_kazatel: this is kinda what I'm trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/8mt7H/1/ but it doesn't work
[15:44:45] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/8/ I am using this to try and remove the comma's from an input field as I need to do some addition with those numbers and the commas are messing it up.

[15:46:53] <LeBlaaanc> http://jsfiddle.net/8mt7H/5/ hah
[15:47:31] <duch_kazatel> because mutated_name doesn't change?
[15:48:04] <LeBlaaanc> haha yep that replace doesn't work
[15:48:09] <LeBlaaanc> nice catch
[15:48:38] <duch_kazatel> you want .replace(/^admission_/, "internship_");
[15:48:58] <duch_kazatel> no quotes around regular expressions except in some cases.
[15:48:59] <LeBlaaanc> son of a bleeeitch
[15:50:05] <LeBlaaanc> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[15:50:11] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[15:53:37] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I have a input field where as its typed it adds comma's to it.So people can see it with commas. But the value I am get from that field I need to have it back without comma's. I am doing some replace stuff but it seems to be splitting the number where the comma is instead of just removing it. Do you have any advice on how to do this properly?
[15:53:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:53:56] <duch_kazatel> sure, one sec.
[15:54:04] <duch_kazatel> woah why the old jqwuery version?
[15:55:10] <phelix> ohh not sure. I don't think that matters to much.. here is my most recent code. http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/9/
[15:55:11] <duch_kazatel> phelix first off "/,/g" isn't a valid regex.
[15:55:16] <phelix> well that is how I am adding it anyway
[15:55:21] <duch_kazatel> you mean /,/g
[15:55:39] <duch_kazatel> and you said you want to "add" to it - you mean add numbers?
[15:55:57] <phelix> No the adding it to the numbers as they  type is working fine by the most recent example
[15:56:09] <duch_kazatel> go back to the original example pls :)
[15:56:16] <phelix> but now I am having to do some addition with it. So in the jquery side I need to revert it back to a digit without ocmmas
[15:56:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/10/
[15:56:49] <duch_kazatel> numbers can't have commas.
[15:57:03] <IceTrAiN> duch_kazatel's official job is removing quotes from around regexes.
[15:57:08] <duch_kazatel> apparently
[15:57:19] <duch_kazatel> phelix you can just do val = parseInt(val.replace(/,/g,""), 10);
[15:57:54] <duch_kazatel> unless you're going to have decimals in there, in which case you want parseFloat.
[15:58:14] <phelix> Well, since I have this being called as its being typed. Once the comma show up it is stripping the number to where the comma was. So in that instance it would work fine as you typed 123 then as soon as you added the 4 to make it 1,234 my value would then just be 1
[15:58:32] <phelix> if that made any sense at all lol
[15:59:15] <duch_kazatel> can you make http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/9/ function?
[15:59:36] <duch_kazatel> wait wtf this this for?
[15:59:44] <phelix> that is how I am adding the comma
[15:59:47] <phelix> and that works great
[15:59:54] <phelix> http://calc.tributemedia.com
[16:00:05] <phelix> look at Step 2 you can see what its doing on console log
[16:00:05] <duch_kazatel> you're munging logic.
[16:00:09] <phelix> yes
[16:00:14] <duch_kazatel> separate things out.
[16:00:18] <phelix> k
[16:01:31] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.tompawlak.org/number-currency-formatting-javascript
[16:01:34] <duch_kazatel> you want something more like this.
[16:02:21] <phelix> yes exactly, its just getting complicated since everything updates as its being typed. So it has to actually remove the commas as they are being typed in
[16:02:45] <IceTrAiN> capture the value for use prior to inserting the comma
[16:03:08] <IceTrAiN> then you don't have to worry about removing it
[16:03:17] <duch_kazatel> or don't update live.
[16:03:47] <phelix> Yah, its gotta update live. Its how the client wants it. I have a function that works perfect in adding the comma. Would just be nice to figure out a function that just removes it the same way.
[16:03:54] <phelix> it adds the comma while its being typed in
[16:04:02] <duch_workbeer> don't even parse in the front of it.
[16:04:08] <phelix> just need a function that removes the comma while its being typed in
[16:04:09] <duch_workbeer> just do the replace always.
[16:04:15] <duch_workbeer> brb
[16:04:19] <phelix> ahh hmm.. yah actually that might work good idea
[16:20:25] <ZP18> Hi
[16:20:49] <ZP18> does anyone know if there is a scrollEnd/scrollStop event?
[16:20:57] <phelix> when using val().replace(/,/g,''); to remove the comma. Its splitting up where the comma is at. For example 13,234 it will only return 13 and then if i change it to 133,245 it will just return 133 and if its 1,323 it will only return 1 how can I take the 2 values that its splitting and add put them back together without the comma?
[16:22:17] <ZP18> systemfault: Hi
[16:26:08] <IceTrAiN> phelix: it works fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/9/
[16:26:29] <IceTrAiN> whoops.. didn't save my changes
[16:27:36] <IceTrAiN> http://jsfiddle.net/XL5dn/11/
[16:29:14] <phelix> IceTrAiN: If ya don't mind look at it here. calc.tributemedia.com on step 2 change "Vendor Manager's average hourly salary:" the value of that and look in console
[16:29:16] <phelix> you will see what I mean
[16:30:35] <phelix> I think its because its being adjusted in real time as you type by the function that adds the comma in
[16:40:48] <rhg> warning
[16:40:48] <rhg>  you may be  watched
[16:40:48] <rhg> do usa&israel use the internet(facebook,youtube,twitter, chat rooms ..ect)to spy??
[16:40:48] <rhg> do usa&israel use the internet 2 collect informations,,can we call that spying??
[16:40:48] <rhg> do they record&analyse everything we do on the internet,,can they harm you using these informations??
[16:40:48] <rhg> 
[16:42:35] <shoky> rhg: yes. got a jquery question?
[16:48:47] <systemfault> shoky: That retart also did it on other channels… like #Haskell.
[16:48:55] <systemfault> *retard :/
[16:49:37] <shoky> i understand spam.. but these kinds of people, i never will
[16:50:33] <systemfault> Neither I. And even if it's true… the spamming isn't going to solve it.
[16:51:13] <systemfault> So… Better leave the computer alone, drink a glass of milk and go to sleep..
[17:14:53] <duch_workbeer> nah man you just... like... don't get it man...
[17:56:49] <Whirl3d> phelix, could you have a <span> element that represented the visual display of the number, and just capture keystrokes? If it's a number, add it to the data-numberstring property and add the commas ($euro,whatever)
[18:18:52] <djQuery> bored someone give me something hard to fix
[18:26:04] <tw2113> IE6 djQuery
[18:26:55] <djQuery> ie 6 rocks
[18:27:46] <tiblock> since you all free, can you tell me difference between a="/" and a="\/"
[18:28:04] <djQuery> tiblock, the 2nd one works
[18:28:12] <tiblock> djQuery, same as 1
[18:29:18] <systemfault> tiblock: The second is only needed in regexes.
[18:29:42] <tiblock> systemfault, so if its not /regex/ then i dont need do \/
[18:29:45] <djQuery> yeah just tried it they the same
[18:29:59] <tiblock> systemfault, it was question
[18:30:08] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/peyuw/1/edit
[18:30:31] <systemfault> tiblock: Right, you need to use \/ if you need a slash in a regex or else it's going to conflict.
[18:30:41] <tiblock> systemfault, okay, thank you
[19:39:41] <inDux> Hi I'm having trouble selecting an <i> element inside of a div
[19:39:51] <inDux> trying to use sibilings();
[19:49:08] <BillCriswell> inDux: You'd want to use .find('i') or .children('i')
[19:49:23] <Jon30> what's the difference between javascript's .map and jquery's $.map?
[19:49:27] <BillCriswell> .siblings() would be the elements before and after the div.
[19:49:51] <systemfault> Jon30: Beside the different syntax, none.
[19:49:59] <naeluh> yo !
[19:50:07] <BillCriswell> Jon30: I think it's mostly there for browser support.
[19:50:12] <Jon30> ahhh
[19:50:12] <systemfault> ^
[19:50:13] <Jon30> gotcha
[19:50:23] <naeluh> looks like js irc has turned into a #sexytime
[19:50:31] <naeluh> haha
[19:50:32] <systemfault> Array#map is ES5, wouldn't work on IE8
[19:50:41] <BillCriswell> I feel so dumb in #javascript haha.
[19:51:02] <BillCriswell> Not as bad as #maths, but still pretty dumb.
[19:51:13] <BillCriswell> ##math*
[19:52:03] <inDux> BillCriswell: thanks for the tip. Just figured it out, it was children('a')
[19:52:24] <BillCriswell> inDux: Word.
[20:05:44] <rahuldroy_> hey guys, I was hoping someone could help me find a better way to find the index of checked radio buttons - http://jsbin.com/nocekufa/1/
[20:10:08] <systemfault> rahuldroy_: Can you give us a useful URL?
[20:10:16] <systemfault> Ah.. nvm
[20:10:27] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy_: http://jsbin.com/nocekufa/2/edit is what I find myself doing when I need the index... Why do you need the index?
[20:10:52] <systemfault> Same question as BillCriswell … that's kind of an evil use of .index
[20:11:33] <rahuldroy_> systemfault: oops the url - http://jsbin.com/nocekufa/1/edit
[20:12:42] <rahuldroy_> BillCriswell: is there a way to get it from a specific one. One liner if possible
[20:12:48] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy_: Why do you need the index?
[20:13:31] <rahuldroy_> BillCriswell: I am writing an application that based on index, it grabs values from arrays
[20:14:38] <rahuldroy_> I can't user value as that is going to be stored in database and this isn't
[20:14:49] <systemfault> rahuldroy_: The nicest way I can think is to use a custom attribute
[20:16:21] <systemfault> rahuldroy_: http://jsbin.com/nocekufa/3
[20:16:48] <systemfault> That way, you don't rely on .index which was bad code.
[20:17:13] <rahuldroy_> systemfault: That did cross my mind but then had to discard it because there is a lot of values based on other values. Actually those arrays are being generated by php classes
[20:17:48] <systemfault> rahuldroy_: Using index is awful because the day the order change, your code is broken.
[20:17:57] <systemfault> It's fragile code.
[20:18:14] <systemfault> And with PHP, it's not difficult to just add the index as a custom attribute
[20:21:06] <rahuldroy_> hmmm, coming to think of it, you are right. Changing the order in my design will also involve changing the order in two other places as well
[20:21:37] <rahuldroy_> very easy to make a mistake when doing maintenance
[20:39:49] <Guest30086> Hi, all. I was wondering about the architecture of jquery, and one thing i wonder about is how can jQuery pass on their own version of this / $(this) inside their closed function callbacks like $('selector').each(function(key, value) {this refers to .selector element});
[20:41:01] <systemfault> Guest30086: .call/.apply
[20:42:01] <Guest30086> ahh. So how would it look like if i'd call onto a closure ? : var closure = function() { console.log(this) } -> closure.apply(args_that_get_placed_into_this?); closure(args) ?
[20:42:04] <systemfault> Guest30086: function lol() { console.log(this.toString()); } lol.call('Hello World');
[20:42:17] <Guest30086> ic
[20:42:35] <Guest30086> lemme try :o brb
[20:42:35] <systemfault> Guest30086: .call and .apply are the same beside one difference.
[20:42:44] <Guest30086> yeah i know the difference
[20:42:48] <systemfault> Ok cool
[20:43:04] <Guest30086> I think -> .call has seperate args, whereas apply passes it on as an object right?
[20:43:28] <Guest30086> like.. .apply({Object}) .call(multiple, args, here, please)
[20:43:37] <systemfault> call = normal args, apply = argument array
[20:43:43] <Guest30086> yep^^
[20:44:04] <systemfault> .call(theThis, arg1, arg2, arg3…….)   .apply(theThis, arrayOfArgs)
[20:48:52] <Guest30086> systemfault: How intriguing; It works but.. If i call the closure, and the only code inside the closure is console.log( this ); i get 2 entries in my log, one is the object literal of what i passed on using .call, and the second one is Window new. Any idea why ? :/
[20:49:49] <systemfault> Guest30086: Not sure what you mean, paste your line of code
[20:50:04] <Guest30086> alright, ill try recreating the scene, one sec. Fiddling
[20:51:53] <Guest30086> http://jsfiddle.net/kGsN9/
[20:52:05] <Guest30086> bit different result here. : Object +  Window /kGsN9/show/
[20:52:37] <systemfault> Guest30086: Ah
[20:53:11] <Guest30086> explain :o
[20:53:21] <systemfault> Guest30086: If you're not in strict mode, if "this" is not defined, it is set to the global object… which is Window in a browser
[20:53:33] <systemfault> In strict mode, you'd get an error
[20:53:49] <Guest30086> hmm, in the fiddle it is not a strict mode.. But the example im having is inside a strict mode closure
[20:54:04] <Guest30086> Or does the strict mode in the main closure not affect anything inside the secondary closure callback ?
[20:54:23] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/kGsN9/1/
[20:54:38] <systemfault> See how this is now undefined?
[20:54:42] <Guest30086> yah
[20:56:32] <Guest30086> soo. The code tree is .. (function() {..main closure using "use strict" -> (function() {another closure where an object is created. (I don't like using constructors} -> Then the call to the closure is happening inside the main Object of this closure)
[20:56:36] <Guest30086> Hope that makes sense..
[20:57:11] <systemfault> Difficult to imagine without seeing the code… I'm a bit tired :/
[20:58:05] <Guest30086> hehe, well its ok. But i just noticed that jquery isn't getting two results, not even 'undefined' right?
[20:58:10] <Guest30086> or am i wrong there... :X
[20:58:58] <systemfault> Guest30086: Where do you get two results?
[20:59:11] <systemfault> If that fiddle, you call the function twice… so you get two results.
[20:59:49] <Guest30086> you call the function using callback.call() ?
[21:00:13] <systemfault> .call() calls the function.
[21:00:22] <Guest30086> i just mean that console.log( this ) ouputs 2 lines 1x Object literal that we set. And once the Window
[21:00:39] <Guest30086> ic.. But why doesn't that happen in jQuery then? If they use the same method
[21:00:44] <el_inventor> hi
[21:00:50] <systemfault> No, you call the function twice.. once with .call and another with the normal () operator
[21:01:20] <Guest30086> is there a way to call it once? All whilst applying with call?
[21:01:30] <Whirl3d> are you asking why jquery never returns an undefined set?
[21:01:41] <Guest30086> Whirl3d; yes.
[21:01:44] <systemfault> Guest30086: You're not clear.
[21:01:57] <systemfault> Guest30086: If you don't want a function to be called twice… call it only once.
[21:02:11] <Whirl3d> because it is more effective to allow chaining if you always return a set even a set of 0 results
[21:02:29] <Guest30086> When for example. I use the $(selector).each(function() {console.log(this) }) only gives me 1 result, and that is their custom Object literal. So techinically they only call it once? :x
[21:02:46] <Guest30086> Whirl3d; not exactly what i meant sorry=p Thanks for the answer anyway
[21:02:50] <el_inventor> i have a cuestion, Does anyone know how I can convert text to speech using jquery javascript?
[21:03:05] <Guest30086> were talking about passing a custom object literal (this) to a callback, without using an argument
[21:03:24] <el_inventor> i have a cuestion, Does anyone know how I can convert text to speech using jquery javascript?
[21:04:57] <systemfault> Guest30086: It's so simple… I don't understand what you don't understand.
[21:05:06] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/kGsN9/2/
[21:05:19] <Whirl3d> console.log(this) logs the html element selected by the selector
[21:05:23] <Guest30086> maybe im just overcomplicating things myself; dunno =p
[21:05:25] <Whirl3d> not the jquery object
[21:06:33] <Guest30086> Whirld3d; i know, but i mean if you would want to create a method that works equal to that. var callback = function() { console.log(this) -> "object, literal, args, go, in, here"} callback.call(object, literal, args, go, in, here)
[21:07:58] <Whirl3d> Are you trolling? I mean what's stopping you? What to do you want "this" to be ?
[21:08:34] <el_inventor> Whirl3d:
[21:08:34] <el_inventor> What's that?
[21:08:46] <Whirl3d> When you say a method, do you mean by extending jquery?
[21:08:49] <Guest30086> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/kGsN9/3/ i think youll get what im trying to do if you see that.
[21:09:40] <Whirl3d> you aren't returning anything to apply the callback to
[21:09:56] <systemfault> Guest30086: http://jsfiddle.net/kGsN9/4/
[21:10:25] <Guest30086> oh, uhh.. Oops :/
[21:10:59] <Guest30086> Is the first argument you give on to .call always going to be the object literal ?
[21:11:04] <el_inventor> i have a cuestion, Does anyone know how I can convert text to speech using jquery javascript? Please...
[21:11:44] <el_inventor> or html5 or anything
[21:11:53] <Whirl3d> el_inventor, sorry I have no clue.
[21:12:08] <Whirl3d> ?.call
[21:12:13] <Whirl3d> doh!
[21:12:22] <el_inventor> :(
[21:12:26] <el_inventor> or html5 or whatever works in all browsers
[21:12:35] <systemfault> Guest30086: It can be anything… it's whatever you want "this" to be inside the function
[21:12:43] <el_inventor> Nothing?
[21:13:00] <Whirl3d> .call is a javascript method, not a jquery method.
[21:13:14] <Guest30086> xD
[21:13:29] <Whirl3d> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[21:14:08] <Guest30086> Whirld3d; i think im just too tired to explain it better, but systemfault; is head on. He gave me exactly what i was searching for; I still thank you very much for your time :)
[21:14:58] <Whirl3d> though none will doubt systemfault's genius and generosity, I still think you are trollin. 8)
[21:15:27] <Guest30086> ps: i know .call including .apply is a javascript method and not a jquery method; Long story short; i was just emphasized / astonished about the functionality of jquery and i wanted to know how they did it!
[21:16:09] <Whirl3d> The code is open source. Check it out.
[21:17:03] <Guest30086> yeah, true that. =) But i can't save all information at once. I mostly check it out once i come across something. And then ill never forget.. If you know what i mean^^ If i just go browse through the open source code to learn without a specific goal of what to learn in mind, ill just be wasting my time with Information overload..
[21:17:47] <Guest30086> << Too chaotic for that.
[21:18:08] <Guest30086> anyway, thanks for your help's guys! Ill be off now :) gnight. or gmorning whatever^^
[21:18:55] <systemfault> We'll never know if he was a troll or not :/
