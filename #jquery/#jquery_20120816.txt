[00:02:53] <juha_> Cork: weren't there a picture of mr. t in the past?
[00:03:14] <zapsoda> cork
[00:03:18] <zapsoda> hows this
[00:03:20] <zapsoda> * cognominal (~cognomina@82.67.232.89) has joined #jquery
[00:03:23] <zapsoda> not that
[00:03:31] <zapsoda> var images = new Array()
[00:03:31] <zapsoda>     function preload() {
[00:03:31] <zapsoda>         for (i = 0; i < preload.arguments.length; i++) {
[00:03:31] <zapsoda>             images[i] = new Image()

[00:03:37] <zapsoda> That ^
[00:03:42] <Cork> zapsoda: pleas don't post multible lines in the channel
[00:03:46] <Cork> *please
[00:03:48] <zapsoda> Ok sorry
[00:03:50] <Cork> ?p @ zapsoda
[00:03:50] <bot-t> zapsoda, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:04:09] <Cork> zapsoda: that will only handle the network and cache load time
[00:04:30] <Cork> not the decoding and rendering time
[00:04:30] <zapsoda> Can you please explain?
[00:04:52] <Cork> if you go back say 5 years
[00:05:33] <Cork> the flow was: 1. the browser finds the image url; 2. it checks if it has the image in cache; 2a. if not fetches it from the source and stores it in cache
[00:05:44] <Cork> 2b. loads it from disk cache if its not in ram cache
[00:06:03] <Cork> 3. decodes the image to a bitmap (one value for each pixels)
[00:06:22] <Cork> 4. when the area where the image is used is shown render it
[00:06:27] <Cork> now days its:
[00:07:25] <Cork> 1 and 2 is the same; 3. when an area where the image is used is shown decode that section of the encoded image and render it
[00:07:51] <Cork> zapsoda: that code helps with 2, but not 3/4
[00:07:56] <zapsoda> Thanks for explaining
[00:08:04] <zapsoda> Very helpful
[00:09:14] <Cork> well modern flow has a 4 too
[00:09:34] <Cork> 4. if the decoded section isn't used in x seconds discards it
[00:11:45] <zapsoda> Ok thanks
[00:15:44] <zapsoda> Cork, will you help me make it so it displays a loading page for 5 seconds
[00:16:11] <zapsoda> Static 5 seconds not until its done loading or anything
[00:16:23] <Cork> .delay(5000).show()
[00:16:31] <Cork> $().hide().delay(5000).show()
[00:18:12] <bigLanky> can someone help me out here? I am currently using this exact example but am getting js errors on my imageflow.js - http://web.enavu.com/tutorials/making-a-jquery-infinite-carousel-with-nice-features/
[00:18:14] <zapsoda> Cork why does JS hate me? http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/
[00:18:19] <zapsoda> its not working ^
[00:18:24] <bigLanky> and here is the page its on - http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/dwight-d-opperman
[00:20:22] <NodeX> bigLanky : you're jquery is not loading
[00:20:30] <NodeX> or it's not assigned to $
[00:20:33] <coldhead> your*
[00:20:37] <Cork> zapsoda: dom ready
[00:20:46] <Cork> zapsoda: without that you won't find #container
[00:21:11] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/sites/all/themes/dwight/js/image_flow/imageflow.js
[00:21:17] <bigLanky> that is loading in the source code
[00:21:51] <NodeX> cool story, either wrap it in an anonymous function with the dollar or change the references from $ to jQuery
[00:23:12] <zapsoda> Still not working :'( Cork
[00:23:20] <DarsVaeda> is there a release timeline?
[00:23:23] <bigLanky> will $(document).ready(function(){ work better?
[00:23:55] <zapsoda> http://puu.sh/VOcv     Cork thats the code
[00:24:54] <NodeX> you can move the slide funciton into the document ready enclosure
[00:25:06] <Cork> zapsoda: document not window
[00:25:10] <NodeX> or change the references to jQuery inside the function
[00:26:13] <zapsoda> Still not working :'( Cork , do you need another pic of my code?
[00:27:17] <bigLanky> ok let me move it up
[00:27:37] <Cork> zapsoda: ugg right .delay() doens't work without animation
[00:28:11] <Cork> zapsoda: you need: $("#container").hide(); setTimeout(function() { $("#container").show(); }, 5000);
[00:28:31] <zapsoda>  ok ill try it
[00:29:00] <Cork> zapsoda: but remember though the image won't render until the .show() happens
[00:29:12] <Cork> so you will still get the flicker
[00:29:16] <zapsoda> Ok
[00:30:01] <Cork> uh sorry *won't decode until
[00:30:08] <zapsoda> Cork, http://puu.sh/VOgB
[00:30:36] <Cork> still need dom ready
[00:31:02] <onats> hi all
[00:31:34] <onats> I'm looking at this file uploader http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/ i was wondering if there's a way to add / edit metadata will the images are still uploading?
[00:32:53] <DarsVaeda> where do I find information on how to use the new grunt-based building system of v1.8?

[00:34:16] <DarsVaeda> seutje: thanks!
[00:35:23] <Cork> zapsoda: uh... your code isn't the same as you just showed me -_-'
[00:35:55] <zapsoda> my code is http://puu.sh/VOkr
[00:36:19] <zapsoda> Sorry
[00:36:25] <zapsoda> forgot to press upload back to server
[00:36:28] <zapsoda> in filezilla
[00:36:56] <juha_> what's with this puush service, you should use jsfiddle to enable us to help you fix your code :P
[00:37:24] <zapsoda> I thought it worked just as well
[00:37:24] <Cork> ya
[00:37:31] <zapsoda> but ill put it in jfiddle
[00:37:33] <Cork> it doesn't
[00:37:34] <zapsoda> jsfiddle
[00:37:49] <juha_> zapsoda: well we can't help you much from a screenshot :P
[00:38:15] <juha_> zapsoda: jsfiddle enables us to play around the code and give you a link to "working" code
[00:38:49] <zapsoda> http://jsfiddle.net/5eaQM/
[00:38:50] <zapsoda> oh
[00:38:58] <zapsoda> ok let me add the rest
[00:39:00] <zapsoda> 1 sec
[00:41:51] <seutje> don't add the script tags
[00:42:08] <zapsoda> http://jsfiddle.net/5eaQM/2/
[00:42:21] <juha_> http://jsfiddle.net/5eaQM/3/
[00:42:32] <juha_> zapsoda: check this
[00:43:07] <seutje> or try actually adding jQuery ;) http://jsfiddle.net/5eaQM/4/
[00:43:09] <juha_> zapsoda: you had mootools selected there
[00:43:28] <zapsoda> mootools?
[00:43:49] <juha_> another js library
[00:44:12] <seutje> it selects mootools by default, doesn't it?
[00:44:23] <seutje> yea, it does
[00:45:09] <zapsoda> ok it works here http://jsfiddle.net/5eaQM/6/ but not ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[00:47:03] <juha_> zapsoda: have you checked console for errors?
[00:47:27] <juha_> zapsoda: also you could have wrong selector or errors somewhere before that snippet
[00:47:31] <seutje> like that syntax error
[00:50:27] <Cork> zapsoda: you have an unprintable character after your ready event
[00:50:33] <Cork> zapsoda: thats why its not running
[00:50:34] <seutje> zapsoda: there seems to be some invisible character after that last semicolon
[00:50:48] <seutje> damn you Cork :P
[00:50:52] <Cork> ;P
[00:51:10] <zapsoda> Ty
[00:51:12] <zapsoda> both
[00:52:24] <bigLanky> i am getting error: slide is not defined
[00:52:40] <bigLanky> http://pastebin.com/rknPZauU
[00:53:17] <NodeX> that's what you get for using a POS like drupal
[00:53:49] <zapsoda> Cork, fixed that but still not working :'(
[00:54:13] <seutje> bigLanky: what line does it flag?
[00:54:40] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/dwight-d-opperman#
[00:54:42] <bigLanky> doesn't flag anything
[00:54:46] <Cork> zapsoda: wfm
[00:54:51] <bigLanky> in my chrome it puts this under the stylesheets tab
[00:54:54] <bigLanky> weird
[00:55:08] <zapsoda> WFM?

[00:55:32] <Cork> bah...
[00:55:37] <Cork> zapsoda: Works For Me
[00:56:01] <zapsoda> On my server or yours?
[00:56:07] <Cork> min?
[00:56:10] <Cork> *mine
[00:56:13] <Cork> i don't have your code
[00:56:34] <zapsoda> I thought you were saying it work for you in jfiddle
[00:56:42] <seutje> bigLanky: then it's probably the implied eval in your setInterval
[00:56:49] <Cork> zapsoda: http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ wfm
[00:57:12] <Cork> zapsoda: though it looks like ready triggers at a weird time in chromium
[00:57:30] <zapsoda> Yha it loads
[00:57:38] <zapsoda> then it goes blank for 5sec
[01:00:03] <zapsoda> Cork, how do i get it to trigger as soon as the file opens?
[01:02:05] <ezotrank> Good day folks. How I can get event when I do $("blabla).val("something"), bind change not work
[01:02:35] <zapsoda> Cork, ?
[01:02:50] <seutje> zapsoda: put it at the bottom and remove doc.rdy
[01:03:03] <Cork> well that might still give the same effect
[01:03:18] <Cork> looks like chrome likes to start to render the page as soon as it reads the dom
[01:03:23] <Cork> and... thats weird
[01:03:24] <seutje> yeah, but that's about the fastest you can do it, right?
[01:03:41] <Cork> sure, but it makes it impossible to do what we'r trying to do
[01:04:32] <seutje> or you could look into the FF technique outlayed here: http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/
[01:04:50] <seutje> or laid out for people who aren't grammatically impaired
[01:05:20] <seutje> pretty much created a style block that hides the body before anything is rendered
[01:05:38] <seutje> creates*
[01:06:39] <Narhir> hey seutje :>
[01:06:42] <Narhir> how are you doing mate?
[01:06:51] <seutje> Narhir: ohai
[01:07:20] <zapsoda> Cork, it doesnt seem to work at all in FF
[01:07:31] <Narhir> remmber me seutje ? -.-
[01:08:08] <seutje> name sounds familiar
[01:08:15] <zapsoda> nvm Cork
[01:08:42] <seutje> Narhir: doing pretty shitty, but not going to go into detail, how's yourself?
[01:08:50] <Narhir> even worse :D
[01:09:11] <Narhir> I'm in tottaly.. bad situation
[01:09:21] <timing> Hi all!
[01:09:24] <Narhir> created new portfolio, which is good thing
[01:09:59] <zapsoda> Grrrrrr
[01:10:06] <zapsoda> This stupid thing
[01:10:18] <timing> I'm currently creating a small piece of javascript to be includeded by other sites from our server. How do I go about updating the file once we have a new version? Just cache a day? A week? Or no cache at all? We expect to have a lot of users
[01:10:43] <zapsoda> the chrome problum still happens if firefox to Cork do you have any ideas?
[01:11:24] <ezakimak> does your server provide 304 status?
[01:11:53] <timing> well not yet :-
[01:11:53] <zapsoda> What?
[01:12:25] <ezakimak> http 304 status. i should hope most modern browsers issue conditional GETs, so they won't actually download the file if it hasn't changed
[01:12:42] <timing> ezakimak: and apache supports that as well I believe?
[01:13:02] <ezakimak> yes apache does
[01:13:50] <timing> ezakimak: sometimes while developing and I hit ctrl+r not all javascript files are re-downloaded
[01:14:03] <ezakimak> if they haven't changed, it doesn't need to
[01:14:40] <ezakimak> watch your server logs and see what the response code is for each request
[01:14:49] <timing> ok thanks
[01:14:57] <ezakimak> i see 200s for files i change and 304s for files i didn't
[01:15:06] <ezakimak> i'm not using apache atm though
[01:15:16] <ezakimak> i should think apache does it right though
[01:16:09] <Cork> zapsoda: uh.. ya, now it does
[01:16:18] <Cork> zapsoda: not i don't have any other idea how to solve it
[01:16:22] <Cork> *no i
[01:16:34] <ezakimak> anyone know of a good jquery plugin that does mega menus and is jq ui themeroller ready?
[01:17:01] <zapsoda> :'(
[01:17:03] <ezakimak> or is trying to stick to themeroller more trouble than it's worth?
[01:21:24] <rahmen> Hi! I'm trying to send a file with ajax but I can't make it work. Does any of this look strange? http://pastebin.com/aGkRukKX# I want it to work cross domain.
[01:35:10] <DarsVaeda> somehow I do not get this modularisation in 1.8, what is the use? I just build my own custom jquery but the space saved is very minimal, I wonder if it is worth it, did I miss something?
[01:36:46] <ezakimak> i can't use 1.8 yet--it breaks things on me
[01:37:03] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: it is a first step on the process
[01:37:10] <ajpiano> not everything has been broken apart
[01:37:34] <DarsVaeda> I see so in future you will be able to exclude anything and just have what you actually use?
[01:37:48] <ajpiano> in theory
[01:38:06] <ajpiano> we will see in time how the core team is able to break the deps apart
[01:38:22] * DarsVaeda nods
[01:38:24] <ajpiano> but it's something people have been asking for for a long time so the idea was to take steps toward that in 1.8
[01:38:36] <DarsVaeda> I see
[01:38:55] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: and there isn't an official "release timeline" but if you've seen the blog post on 1.9/2.0 it sort of makes it clear
[01:39:02] <ezakimak> it's usually a good exercise in any codebase--forces you to reexamine things and you wind up with refactoring and better code overall
[01:39:23] <clocKwize> whats the difference between Something.something.something and Something.something["something"] ? I've changed it (refactoring) and now tests are failing
[01:39:31] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/
[01:39:47] <DarsVaeda> ajpiano: yes just reading it, thanks :) did not see it before
[01:48:08] <faraway> DarsVaeda: i made the experience from my coding that writing the code modular has the big advantage that maintaing is easier, because the dependencies of the code parts are clearer and you are really forced to keep the modules separated. otherwise you could be  be tempted to relax the boundaries. But this is just my personal experience.
[01:49:21] <DarsVaeda> I really like it too but I'm not advanced enough in js :( I read the brilliant book "JavaScript Patterns" unfortunately many examples are too far away for me to get them (yet)
[01:54:11] <faraway> DarsVaeda: for js i prefer event driven communication (pub/sub system) and composition. i think it reflects the prototype language better then attempts to emulate class base oop with inheritence. i also think that lazy loading and remote data can be implemented better this way.
[01:55:25] <DarsVaeda> as far as I got it, the book does not want to emulate the usual oop patterns :)
[01:56:36] <faraway> DarsVaeda: that was just about the libraries that emulate the support of inheritance with super calls
[01:59:45] <faraway> DarsVaeda: i definitely like the observing and binding pattern, but as long defineProperty is not widely supported i would have to use the get/set function fallback which is not very elegant
[02:07:33] <jrockjiggz> i'm getting ajax form with any amount of checkboxes.  I can ID them by starting at 0, but on a new ajax request, the checkboxes start at 0 again
[02:08:53] <faraway> jrockjiggz: hmm .. i'm not sure what exactly the problem is
[02:10:47] <jrockjiggz> the data loading into DIV is a list of checkboxes, starting at id="checkbox0".  but if I load another set of checkboxes, they again will start at 0, causing a conflict in the DOM
[02:11:20] <jrockjiggz> i'm thinking using php $randomId = rand(0, 999); and assinging the id="checkbox<?php echo $random.$i; ?>"
[02:11:23] <jrockjiggz> i guess that works..
[02:12:01] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: Or just add a timestamp?
[02:12:05] <faraway> jrockjiggz: ah ok now i know what you mean â€¦ random is a bad idea :D
[02:12:32] <mazzachre> jrist-afk: Adding random is a bad idea ya... sooner or later you will get a conflict and it will be next to impossible to debug
[02:12:43] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: that was for you ^^
[02:12:52] <jrockjiggz> there will probably only be request, maybe up to 5..
[02:12:53] <faraway> jrockjiggz: yes either timestamp or do the the numbering when you received the data
[02:13:08] <jrockjiggz> ok, thanks you're right
[02:13:48] <mazzachre> jrockjiggz: There is nothing in random that stops it from returning the same number 100mio times in a row (although unlikely...)
[02:14:49] <wingy> I have a HTML string and within this string there is one element with an id .. how do I insert elements within this element using html()?
[02:16:07] <faraway> wingy: create the dom elements then add the elements to the element with the id and then convert it back to html
[02:16:07] <mazzachre> wingy: $(yourhtmlstring).find('#yourid').html(morehtml) ought to work...
[02:16:52] <mazzachre> wingy: But adding it first to the dom and them manipulating definitely work (You can always add it to an invisible temporary div)
[02:17:11] <ak> is there some crossbrowser solution to get the "difference" of two arrays?
[02:17:32] <faraway> ak: define differences :D
[02:18:09] <faraway> ak: there are js implementions around that implement the diff algorithm
[02:18:27] <ak> no jquery alternative here huh?
[02:18:51] <mazzachre> Is there an event or some other way to get that text have been pasted into an input field?
[02:19:05] <mazzachre> ak: Not in std. jquery, but there are plugins for it
[02:19:39] <faraway> ak: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1187518/javascript-array-difference
[02:19:48] <ak> thanks
[02:20:11] <ak> maybe i go with underscore's _.difference()
[02:20:27] <faraway> ak: there is an Jquery sample on that page
[02:22:26] <faraway> mazzachre: the change event ?
[02:23:45] <Yield> Hello
[02:24:31] <mazzachre> faraway: I am already listening to keyup and change, none of them fires when I paste into a field... Neither to they trigger when using the browsers autocomplete
[02:36:31] <seutje> mazzachre: common problem, only solutions I've seen use intervals or something similar
[03:09:14] <mazzachre> seutje: Hmmm... ya, that is a pita... It is kind of bad having to do something like setInterval(function(elem) {return function() {$(elem).trigger('change');}(this), 250); on each input field where this can happen... sigh
[03:10:44] <mazzachre> Is there anything about ordering in JSON? I am sending a json object from my server, and just want to make sure the properties are in the same order after decoding?
[03:15:49] <ak> how can i select all the input fields with empty values in a form (.val() === '') ?
[03:16:10] <faraway> mazzachre: why does the ordering of there property matter to you ?
[03:18:22] <Ayush> Hello can anybody help me in how do i delete all script tag from ajax responce data ?
[03:18:58] <zfkevin> I made a fiddle, dit put in the things i did try and the result i want. Can anyone help me out ?
[03:19:02] <zfkevin> http://jsfiddle.net/zQbNw/
[03:19:35] <zfkevin> * I want the divs to fadein x seconds after each other ( more info + markup is in the fiddle)
[03:20:08] <faraway> Ayush: $(response).find("script").remove();
[03:20:37] <faraway> Ayush: afaik the script will be only exectued at the point where you add it to the document
[03:21:20] <Ayush> i dont want to add the script i just want to remove script tag from the responce string.
[03:21:36] <Ayush> i dont want to add the html on dom*
[03:22:10] <faraway> Ayush: what do you want to do with it ?
[03:23:20] <faraway> Ayush: that is the purpose why you want to remove it?
[03:23:30] <faraway> Ayush: -that +what
[03:23:54] <Ayush> i am writing a jQuery plugin and i want to filter the html.
[03:24:15] <seutje> mazzachre: think somebody made a plugin for it though
[03:24:29] <faraway> Ayush: i make a jsfiddle
[03:25:08] <seutje> mazzachre: http://furrybrains.com/2009/01/02/capturing-autofill-as-a-change-event/
[03:25:18] <seutje> it's not ideal, as he repeats some selectors and stuff, and I haven't tried it
[03:26:31] <Ayush> thanks
[03:26:34] <Ayush> in advance
[03:27:53] <Ayush> zfkevin : http://jsfiddle.net/zQbNw/342/
[03:29:12] <zfkevin> Ayush thnx but i am sorry. I just found out i did paste the wrong fiddle :S
[03:29:14] <zfkevin> http://jsfiddle.net/GwXHA/
[03:29:33] <zfkevin> i will give your solution on the other fiddle a try anyway :)
[03:29:34] <faraway> Ayush: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/ap3Py/2/
[03:29:37] <tehcyx> is it possible to access a popup windows url in the closing event?
[03:30:48] <faraway> Ayush: i hope your aim is not to use this to filter out script tags before sending to the server for storing
[03:30:52] <Ayush> Wow Thanks faraway
[03:31:04] <Ayush> no no..
[03:31:43] <zfkevin> works :)
[03:31:49] <faraway> Ayush: i used the additional div cause i currently don't know which browsers support outerHtml
[03:31:54] <Ayush> i am making one jQuery plugin in which i dont want script tag.. and other like noscript
[03:32:24] <zfkevin> @ayush: thnx http://jsfiddle.net/GwXHA/1/
[03:32:25] <Ayush> i was doing same like this but i was not adding that div wrap ...
[03:32:43] <Ayush> welcome.
[03:32:44] <faraway> Ayush: yeah html only returns the innerHtml
[03:32:52] <seutje> ?g outerhtml
[03:32:54] <bot-t> seutje, element.outerHTML | Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.outerHTML
[03:33:08] <zfkevin> is there a quick explanation why
[03:33:09] <zfkevin> $(".name-item").each(function(){ $(this).delay(3000).fadeIn(300); });
[03:33:09] <seutje> I was actually looking for the cross-browser plugin, but alright
[03:33:14] <zfkevin> did not work
[03:33:21] <Ayush> dont paste code here.
[03:33:34] <zfkevin> :) ok won`t do it again
[03:34:19] <seutje> one-liners are fine imo
[03:34:40] <seutje> reason that doesn't work like you expect is cause they all have their own queue, sorta kinda
[03:34:41] <faraway> seutje: yes i wrote that some lines before â€¦ i used the <div> cause didn't know the browser what does the (11) mean for FF
[03:34:48] <Ayush> coz its not correct to do that task..
[03:35:09] <faraway> seutje: * that supports it
[03:35:54] <seutje> zfkevin: try using the callback with next()
[03:36:13] <zfkevin> ok so the .each() will execute the function all on the time on all the elements matched
[03:36:16] <tehcyx> is it possible to access a popup windows url in the closing event? http://jsfiddle.net/LE3PR/1/
[03:36:26] <zfkevin> *same time
[03:38:20] <seutje> zfkevin: http://jsfiddle.net/GwXHA/2/
[03:38:20] <faraway> tehcyx: if it is cross domain you cannot
[03:38:55] <seutje> zfkevin: basically, grab the first, do the fadeIn, when done, grab the next one, see if there is a next one, do fadeIn on that, rinse+repeat till you're out of next ones
[03:39:47] <wingy> is there a way to get whatever content inside an element not just the text?
[03:39:48] <seutje> you could probably avoid the repetition of the delay and fadeIn calls by clever use of function.call or something
[03:39:59] <wingy> and then paste it inside another element
[03:40:00] <zfkevin> Thnx now i see why it didnt work. but i think http://jsfiddle.net/GwXHA/1/ is a better solution ?
[03:40:08] <tehcyx> faraway: i open a cross domain which redirects me to a .html which closes my popup. still not possible?
[03:40:15] <seutje> wingy: $('.element').html($('.otherelement').html());
[03:41:05] <Ayush> zfkevin both are diff way.. to do same task
[03:41:17] <Ayush> both are good
[03:41:29] <seutje> zfkevin: iono, jsperf it
[03:42:02] <r500> if there is one class attach to a list element. can i append one more class to list element while code executing. ?
[03:42:23] <seutje> ?addclass @ r500
[03:42:23] <bot-t> r500, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[03:42:48] <faraway> tehcyx: you could try the check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.closed with. setInterval , but i don't know in which browsers this works
[03:43:05] <zfkevin> ill take a look at jsperf(.com) later.
[03:43:17] <zfkevin> thnx for the help guys ! and for the explanation
[03:43:31] <wingy> seutje: thanks!
[03:43:41] <r500> seutje:  thanks :)
[03:43:48] <wingy> are there good books you recommend for learning jquery?
[03:44:26] <seutje> nope
[03:44:31] <tehcyx> faraway: thanks, i'll try that.
[03:44:46] <Ayush> i know today about http://jsperf.com/ its cool :D..
[03:45:01] <Ayush> Thanks for info now m out bye..
[03:45:02] <seutje> I guess "learning jquery" should be good, comes rather highly recommended... not sure how up-to-date it is
[03:45:19] <seutje> but learningjquery.com is also a nice resource, prolly somewhat more up-to-date
[03:46:14] <seutje> wingy: also: jqfundamentals
[03:46:45] <seutje> and fixingthesejqueries is a must-read for debugging
[03:47:14] <Misiur> Hello. Is there way to set default method for all ui dialogs? http://jsfiddle.net/XjEsn/ more or less?

[03:51:15] <Raydiation> how do i get the first listem when i have $listItems = $('ul.list');
[03:51:39] <faraway> $('ul.list li:first');
[03:51:40] <Raydiation> $listItems[0] does return a dom item right?
[03:51:49] <Raydiation> faraway: ty
[03:51:53] <seutje> yeah, but that'll still return the UL
[03:57:08] <rahmen> Anyone who knows a jquery plugin that handles cross domain file uploads? I've found a few demos/examples but can't make them work...
[03:58:17] <mink> Hello. How I can execute function on document load, looks like $(elem).ready(function(){}); ?     element.ready(function(){     console.log($(this));       });  return #document, not $(element)
[04:01:53] <Birliban> hi, how can i manage that a gif loader stops when all ajax requests are finished? If i put it at the end of the trigger event the loader doesn't even appear, if i put it into the ajax function, the loader stops just after the first request is finished...
[04:02:38] <faraway> mink: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[04:03:27] <mink> noo way faraway :D
[04:03:45] <faraway> Birliban: remainingRequests = 10; and in each callback if( --remainingRequests == 0 ) hideLoader();
[04:03:57] <faraway> Birliban: something like this
[04:05:24] <mink> faraway, I want to make function looks like this ->>         \checkbox.bind("ready", update_checkbox);
[04:06:26] <Birliban> faraway, good idea! thought there was something built in with eventhandles e.g. Thanks!
[04:07:34] <shwaiil> hi

[04:10:27] <shwaiil> sahbeewah: thanks for looking ;)
[04:10:50] <sahbeewah> np, looking is what i do best
[04:19:45] <Gargoyle> Is there a way I can create dom elements that contain <script> tags and add them to the page dynamically?
[04:30:40] <jita> What does return false signify in this context onclick="accuracy(1); return false;" ?
[04:31:55] <nFFF> stops the event from bubbling up the dom tree or default actions
[04:37:38] <jita> nFFF, thanks
[04:48:24] <faraway> Birliban: you could make your own function that calls the original ajax and add something like a namespace or id and automate this if you need it multiple times with different counters
[04:49:56] <faraway> Birliban: it isn't build in cause there are so many different use cases that it is nearly impossible to create the one solution that will fit all needs
[04:53:38] <beepbeep_> When using .ajax is it possible to specify which parts of the page need reloading? I'd like to only reload a certain div.
[04:55:02] <mink> beepbeep_, Can you paste your ajax function?
[04:55:26] <mink> beepbeep_, In succeess function you can define what div should be reloaded
[04:56:12] <faraway> beepbeep_: or you can use this http://api.jquery.com/load/  if you only return the data that should be replaced
[04:56:29] <Teduardo> two questions 1) does anyone know if it's possible to fix jquery ui slider so that it can slide on drag like on a phone or tablet 2) does anyone know of a nice way to make graphs/charts using jquery, or should this be done server side?
[04:57:06] <faraway> Teduardo: http://code.google.com/p/flot/
[04:58:11] <faraway> Teduardo: you want to make the ui usable on mobile devices ?
[04:58:27] <beepbeep_> mink: I haven't written it yet :)
[04:58:58] <beepbeep_> faraway: don't think it'll reload data, it reloads the current page, but I only want to refresh a certain div.
[04:59:07] <beepbeep_> it'll return data*
[05:00:39] <faraway> beepbeep_: with $(someSelector).load("url/to/data.html") the data the is returnd by the request is loaded into the element that matches someSelector
[05:01:59] <beepbeep_> faraway, okay. thx
[05:17:30] <beepbeep_> mink: how do I define what div should be reloaded?
[05:18:19] <beepbeep_> aha found
[05:18:20] <beepbeep_> :)
[05:31:51] <martisj> morning
[05:33:04] <darkfrog> hey guys, I've got a listener: jQuery(document).on('focus', '*', function(event) { ... }); that works perfectly on Firefox, but on Chrome it doesn't fire when I click a button.  Why is this?
[05:33:21] <darkfrog> is it because the button doesn't receive focus?
[05:41:47] <faraway> darkfrog: that depends on the browser/system, it the callback will be called if the button receives focus via tab
[05:42:34] <faraway> darkfrog: it is not defined that a button needs to get the focus on a click
[05:42:58] <darkfrog> faraway: yeah, I simply added 'click' to fire the same functionality and that seems to have resolved it.
[05:43:24] <Jon47> make sure it doesn't fire twice in the other browsers where both "focus" and "click" occur
[05:43:58] <darkfrog> Jon47: actually it doesn't matter if it does considering this is just modifying a hidden input to be able to tell the server which field is focused
[05:53:58] <Gargoyle> Any thoughts on why this isn't working? http://pastie.org/private/czmzxf6lcox4jzmcwnn5ew
[05:54:37] <Gargoyle> In other places, I call $('selector').html(item['html']) and it works.
[05:54:42] <LordThumper> Is it possible to follow a link with javascript?
[05:54:58] <Gargoyle> but when I look at the code for the pastie example, there is no script tag.
[05:55:00] <LordThumper> $("a").click() fires click event handlers, but doesn't open the href
[05:55:33] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: you can manually navigate to the href using window.location.assign
[05:55:46] <johnkpaul> or you can create an _actual_ click event, using document.createEvent
[05:56:24] <LordThumper> The problem is, the href has target="_blank"
[05:56:31] <TheFuzzball> I have a jQuery plugin using this pattern - http://pastie.org/4521283
[05:56:42] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: so window.open rather than window.location.assign
[05:56:48] <TheFuzzball> How can I extend this plugin to add methods?
[05:56:51] <LordThumper> and when I try to replicate with window.open("link", "_blank"), at least chrome blocks the popup
[05:57:06] <LordThumper> Well that is intended behaviour i guess
[05:57:11] <Gargoyle> LordThumper: And so it should! :)
[05:57:19] <LordThumper> hehe
[05:57:58] <Gargoyle> LordThumper: What's the need for pretending to click a link?
[05:58:16] <LordThumper> I was overthinking things
[05:58:34] <LordThumper> I have an element that shows a qTip (tooltip) on hover
[05:59:13] <LordThumper> and I wanted to allow the user to follow the link by clicking the element
[05:59:38] <LordThumper> And instead of wrapping the element with <a>, stupid me was trying to attach an onclick event handler :P
[05:59:40] <Gargoyle> so put the a tag round the element!
[05:59:44] <Gargoyle> :)
[05:59:54] <LordThumper> hehe
[06:00:14] <Gargoyle> So any thoughts on why .append() is stripping my <script> tags?
[06:02:16] <LordThumper> Gargoyle
[06:02:18] <LordThumper> $("<script type='text/javascript'>function hello () { console.log('hello') }</script>").appendTo("body");
[06:02:20] <LordThumper> Worked for me
[06:02:26] <faraway> Gargoyle: well the script tags aren't added , thats correct. but they are executed
[06:03:11] <faraway> Gargoyle: so you won't see them in the dom if you mean that
[06:03:36] <Gargoyle> faraway: That's odd. because I use the same html snippet elsewhere by using .html('snippet') and I see the script tags in the dom
[06:04:32] <LordThumper> Yeah for some reason the script element doesn't appear in the DOM inspector
[06:04:34] <LordThumper> atleast in Chrome
[06:04:39] <LordThumper> but I can run the script i added
[06:06:52] <faraway> Gargoyle: in which browser ?
[06:07:13] <Gargoyle> maybe notâ€¦ might have been seeing cached results - or just going mad! :P
[06:07:30] <faraway> Gargoyle: hehe ok
[06:08:30] <faraway> LordThumper: that reason it does not appear is that it is removed before adding and the content is evaluated. afaik this is the only way to get the same behavior cross browser
[06:08:45] <LordThumper> Ah I see
[06:10:54] <a7p> hi everyone - does some kind of compressed diff-log exist for jquery? I've got a menu which works fine on touch devices with query 1.4.2 but breaks with 1.8.0 - touch events seem to get handled differently.
[06:11:19] <kkuno> hi
[06:11:34] <ak> a7p: try github?
[06:11:44] <kkuno> I need a way to determine if a text element is selected by the mouse
[06:11:55] <a7p> ak: I was afraid it'd come to that ;).
[06:11:56] <a7p> thx.
[06:12:04] <kkuno> I can get the text of the selection with window.selection()
[06:12:21] <kkuno> but I need to highlight the text selected by the mouse
[06:13:51] <LordThumper> kkuno: You can apply some background-color css to your text element
[06:17:32] <agileadam> I've been struggling with closest(), parent(), prev() etcâ€¦ can someone explain to me how to hide any <h3> tags whose text matches the text of the nearest <h3> before the current one?  Simple code example: http://jsfiddle.net/rxxSM/
[06:17:42] <agileadam> Looking to have the second "My title" <h3> hidden
[06:18:25] <agileadam> closest('h3') matches the current h3, so that doesn't work. I've tried all sorts of variations of parent with findâ€¦ using each as well. Can't get it to work :(
[06:18:48] <kkuno> LordThumper, yeah, but I don't know how to detect it
[06:19:02] <kkuno> I don't know which DOM element has been selected
[06:20:09] <LordThumper> kkuno: I'm not sure you can get the element directly
[06:20:26] <LordThumper> Does something like this work for you $(":contains(selectedText)")
[06:20:50] <Gargoyle> \O/
[06:21:26] <kkuno> LordThumper, it works, but doesn't work for not unique text
[06:21:35] <kkuno> i.e. I selected "and"
[06:21:42] <kkuno> btw, I think I solved
[06:21:55] <kkuno> document.getSelection() has nice properties
[06:21:58] <Gargoyle> Getting closer. Makes sense that the JS is executed and not appended to the dom - I obviously cant use the swfmedia js on an element that isn't in the DOM yet!
[06:23:34] <LordThumper> $(document.getSelection().baseNode).parent()
[06:23:36] <LordThumper> Try that
[06:24:31] <LordThumper> Doesn't work perfectly if text spans multiple elements
[06:26:10] <LordThumper> But yeah think you're getting close
[06:26:24] <kkuno> document.getSelection().anchorNode.parentNode
[06:26:26] <kkuno> yeah :P
[06:28:39] <darkfrog> is there any way to tell an HTML INPUT *not* to click a button or which button to click when enter is pressed on the input?
[06:29:15] <darkfrog> oddly hitting enter on my input is clicking the button above it instead of the one beside it
[06:29:16] <parrott> Traditionally, that's what the "submit" button is reserved for, right?
[06:29:32] <darkfrog> parrott: alas there are several submit buttons on this page
[06:29:35] <parrott> Is the button above it of type "submit"?
[06:29:39] <darkfrog> yes
[06:30:01] <parrott> Feh. Downgrade all of them to mere buttons except the one you wish to be the enter button. :l
[06:30:37] <parrott> It may just be going for the first submit that it comes across.
[06:31:16] <darkfrog> perhaps
[06:31:31] <darkfrog> how do I determine the form that a button is attached to?
[06:31:39] <LordThumper> darkfrog: either type='button' or $("button").on("keypress", function (e) { if (e.which === 13) { return false; } });
[06:32:04] <LordThumper> should stop the submit behaviour
[06:32:41] <LordThumper> then if you want to submit manually $("button").find("form").submit();
[06:32:55] <darkfrog> LordThumper: I want the form to submit when the button is pressed, just not for hitting enter on the INPUT not to click the button
[06:33:00] <LordThumper> closest not find *
[06:33:12] <a7p> ah, the deprecation of "hover" destroyed my website.
[06:33:29] <LordThumper> oh yeah my mistake
[06:33:37] <LordThumper>  $("input").on("keypress", function (e) { if (e.which === 13) { return false; } });
[06:33:39] <LordThumper> should work
[06:33:52] <darkfrog> LordThumper: ah, that would be easier...let me try that. :)
[06:35:21] <darkfrog> LordThumper: will $("button").find("form").submit(); submit the form this button is attached to if there are multiple forms on the page?
[06:36:22] <LordThumper> yes
[06:36:28] <LordThumper> but use .closest not .find
[06:36:31] <LordThumper> my mistake
[06:36:39] <LordThumper> $("button").closest("form").submit()
[06:36:43] <nFFF> your form is within button?
[06:37:00] <LordThumper> ^
[06:37:08] <darkfrog> nFFF: hehe...no, the reverse
[06:38:00] <LordThumper> Well I'm kinda not sure how multiple forms work, in asp.net you can only have one form
[06:38:20] <LordThumper> But that should do the trick
[06:38:38] <alcuadrado> is focus always trigered before blur while changing the selected element?
[06:38:44] <Macca-> asp.net webforms** can only have 1 form. mvc you can have many
[06:39:31] <LordThumper> Right ^
[06:41:10] <mikehaas763> Good morning, I am using jquery tools tooltip for forms. How can I position it relatively to the form input beneath the input?
[06:41:40] <Macca-> hi apathy-! welcome to #jquery !
[06:41:56] <apathy-> hey guys, got a quick question about jqueryui/datatables, specifically the mdataprop function
[06:41:59] <LordThumper> alcuadrado:
[06:42:03] <apathy-> hey brendan :)
[06:42:06] <LordThumper> $("#foo").on('change blur focus', function (e) { console.log(e.type) });
[06:42:12] <LordThumper> See for yourself
[06:42:44] <apathy-> if i pass a function name to mDataProp, and dump the data argument, i get the entire row's data back, not just the columt to which the mDataProp column pertains
[06:42:50] <apathy-> is there any way of getting around this?
[06:43:36] <alcuadrado> LordThumper, that would only tell me how it works in my browser, nothing about the specs
[06:44:19] <LordThumper> Well browsers should have same behaviour if they follow the standard
[06:44:56] <LordThumper> Try the code in your target browsers if you're paranoid
[06:45:35] <LordThumper> Or is installing Opera too much hassle for you?
[06:47:40] <BBJames> anyone any idea how to debug an error that happens the I evalScripts()?
[06:47:40] <apathy-> Macca-: fix my datatables :D
[06:51:11] <shiftingcontrol> I am trying to disable a button if text field is empty, on loading the page button like submit is disabled, when during key press if text input is empty button is disabled, when user types button is enabled, how to detect if user deletes all the chars and submits the button ,should i look inside .focus or .blur to see whenever inout field is null
[06:52:05] <Macca-> ok!
[06:52:09] * Macca- goes to fix
[06:52:31] <beepbeep_> Hey all, I'm trying to load a certain div on ajax success using replaceWith but get "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .parents(table)", can anyone take a look? http://codepad.org/AsVrZlLl
[06:52:33] <mikehaas763> Hi, can someone look at this fiddle for me? (http://jsfiddle.net/dKf7r/1/) I have some tooltip code that displays a nice looking tooltip when a form input is selected. However, at page load I have a form input autofocus. I am at a loss as to how I can make the tooltip also display when a form field is auto focused to.
[06:52:47] <rwparri2> how to I find all <a> tags that have an element data-elementguid? Neither 'a [data-elementguid]' and '[data-elementguid] a' works
[06:52:59] <etisfo> How can I prevent form submission unless a text field has a value greater than 1?
[06:53:00] <Macca-> a[data-elementguid]
[06:53:02] <Macca-> drop the space
[06:53:24] <Macca-> the first looks for elements that are children of an <a>, the latter looks for <a>'s that are a child of the element
[06:53:31] <LordThumper> shiftingcontrol: if ($("element").text() == "") { console.log("empty") }
[06:53:44] <rwparri2> ah!, I should have realized that   thank you Macca-
[06:54:06] <darkfrog> LordThumper: that did the trick...thanks for the help. :)
[06:54:15] <LordThumper> or ($("input").val() == "") { console.log("empty") }
[06:54:27] <LordThumper> darkfrog: np :)
[06:55:35] <LordThumper> shiftingcontrol: Ups misread your message
[06:56:04] <beepbeep_> Hey all, I'm trying to load a certain div on ajax success using replaceWith but get "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .parents(table)", can anyone take a look? http://codepad.org/AsVrZlLl
[06:56:21] <LordThumper> shiftingcontrol: Check the code in the "keypress" event
[06:56:35] <etisfo> How can I prevent form submission unless a text field has a value greater than or equal to 1?
[06:56:39] <LordThumper> $("input").on("keypress", function () {  });
[06:57:00] <shiftingcontrol> LordThumper, ok , I am doing that but $('#speaker_name').keypress(function(){
[06:57:01] <shiftingcontrol>       if ($("#speaker_name").val() !== ''){
[06:57:01] <shiftingcontrol>         $('#add-speaker').removeAttr('disabled');
[06:57:01] <shiftingcontrol>     } else {
[06:57:01] <shiftingcontrol>       if (!$("#add-speaker").attr("disabled")){
[06:57:02] <shiftingcontrol>         console.log("inside removal");
[06:57:04] <shiftingcontrol>         $("#add-speaker").attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[06:57:06] <shiftingcontrol>       }
[06:57:08] <shiftingcontrol>     }
[06:57:10] <shiftingcontrol>   });
[06:57:27] <shiftingcontrol> well , sorry for that https://gist.github.com/3370309
[06:58:53] <shiftingcontrol> I am not sure that is right way to check, since there are events like blur, focus, keypress etc ,,,
[07:00:18] <darkfrog> is there any way to differentiate between "click" on a submit button from a user directly or one that comes programmatically by submitting the form?
[07:00:59] <agileadam> Still no luck. Can someone explain to me how to hide any <h3> tags whose text matches the text of the nearest <h3> before the current one?  Simple code example: http://jsfiddle.net/rxxSM/
[07:01:52] <agileadam> I'd like the second "My title" hidden...
[07:05:52] <beepbeep_> Can anyone take a look at http://codepad.org/AsVrZlLl ? I get a syntax error, "unrecognized expression: .parents(table)"

[07:10:12] <etisfo> How can I prevent form submission unless a text field has a value greater than or equal to 1? :)
[07:10:26] <agileadam> faraway: whoa. I wasn't even closeâ€¦. :(
[07:10:34] <seutje> beepbeep_: no syntax error here
[07:10:35] <alcuadrado> any way to focus a jquery ui autocomplete itme programatically?
[07:11:00] <agileadam> faraway: so weirdâ€¦ I never thought to go from top to bottomâ€¦ instead of bottom to topâ€¦
[07:11:10] <beepbeep_> seutje, if u open the codepad again, the syntax error happens on line 11, not line 3. Should have mentioned that.

[07:11:44] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/pg72t/
[07:11:49] <faraway> agileadam: shell i write the correct if clauses instad of the and operators or do you understand that syntax ?
[07:11:49] <LordThumper> hacky as hell but it works
[07:12:02] <agileadam> faraway: I'm thinking I get it.
[07:12:33] <faraway> agileadam: it is just a short cut for if ( last )  if( â€¦ === â€¦ ) hide
[07:13:06] <agileadam> faraway: awesome.
[07:13:09] <seutje> etisfo: $('form').bind('submit', function(e) { if (parseInt($(this).find('.textfield')) < 1) { e.preventDefault(); } }); or something?
[07:13:16] <shiftingcontrol> LordThumper, Thanks, should work,  Is there way to bind all event to input tag ?
[07:13:23] <seutje> crap, add a .val() after that .textfield
[07:13:52] <agileadam> faraway: very interesting. I like it! Thanks!
[07:13:57] <etisfo> seutje, will that do it for all forms, or can I specify using an id/class?
[07:14:16] <seutje> uhm... yes :D
[07:14:24] <seutje> to both
[07:14:55] <seutje> also, I'm assuming textfield is the class of your textfield and I'm assuming it resides within the form being submitted
[07:15:07] <etisfo> seutje, how can I make it specific to a form with an id of "dmns"
[07:15:48] <faraway> agileadam: It was not intentional that i wrote that. i just switch from my code to here and in my code if often use e.g. ( test || {}  ) for default values if the and also && in instead of if clauses
[07:15:48] <seutje> you change the selector from the form tag to that id
[07:16:22] <faraway> agileadam: -"if the"
[07:16:23] <agileadam> faraway: (rereading that message a few times ;)
[07:16:35] <LordThumper> shiftingcontrol $(element).on("blur, focus, focusin, focusout, load, resize, scroll, unload, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave, change, select, submit, keydown, keypress, keyup, error", function (e) { });
[07:16:43] <LordThumper> Couldnt find direct link
[07:16:49] <seutje> you need to use commas in that?
[07:16:52] <shiftingcontrol> LordThumper, wow
[07:17:03] <LordThumper> ah right
[07:17:04] <LordThumper> no commas
[07:17:07] <LordThumper> copy-pasta
[07:17:23] <faraway> agileadam: sorry â€¦ :D doing multble things the same time isn't good
[07:17:53] <agileadam> faraway: no worries! I appreciate the assistance (and explaination)
[07:18:14] <etisfo> seutje, http://trashb.info/3b911616
[07:18:19] <etisfo> Isn't working :(
[07:18:28] <faraway> agileadam: using && and || instead of if  isn't always a good style but in some cases it is more reable
[07:18:45] <agileadam> faraway: yeahâ€¦ takes an extra second to make sense of it.
[07:19:01] <shiftingcontrol> LordThumper, how about this http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[07:20:55] <faraway> agileadam: depends http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/cdp7c/
[07:21:16] <agileadam> faraway: oh wow.. yeah.
[07:21:21] <agileadam> huge readability difference.
[07:21:41] <faraway> agileadam: ok width height is not the best example because then width and height could not be 0
[07:21:41] <agileadam> that's crazy
[07:21:53] <agileadam> faraway: I get the point though
[07:22:06] <faraway> agileadam: but general this looks clearer in most cases
[07:22:59] <kontoo> herro! is there a way to make the jQuery UI radio button widget more responsive? toggling between two states A and B has some significant delay, if you click too fast it won't switch states at all
[07:23:18] <kontoo> I can provide an example if that helps
[07:24:15] <pachet> kontoo: yeah, that would help
[07:25:32] <kontoo> pachet: http://134.102.106.5/chat/
[07:25:36] <seutje> etisfo: ugh, guess I'll hold your hand the entire way: http://jsfiddle.net/spHsz/2/
[07:25:45] <seutje> go ahead, copy/paste, learn jack shit
[07:25:47] <kontoo> try toggling the buttons fast
[07:26:02] <kontoo> sometimes it won't change anything ("feels laggy / getting stuck")
[07:27:08] <EnginA> what would be a very good service provider with very good redundancy ?
[07:27:09] <alisson> I have a jquery code who need run only afther some codes and  iframes content are ready. I've tryed the load() event, but the load do not consider the iframe content loading. Here is an example:  http://jsbin.com/oweyih/1/edit
[07:27:16] <alisson> Somebody can help me with this?
[07:27:57] <EnginA> you control the iframe content ?
[07:28:46] <LordThumper> alisson: from iframe
[07:28:47] <etisfo> seutje, is there a way to popup a message saying it needs to be above or equal to 1?
[07:28:51] <LordThumper> top.readyFunction()
[07:28:58] <LordThumper> Doesn't work cross-domain
[07:29:06] <seutje> etisfo: yes
[07:29:38] <pachet> kontoo: i can't get it to replicate what you're describing
[07:29:46] <pachet> kontoo: maybe my click-foo isnt fast enough
[07:29:48] <etisfo> seutje, how? :)
[07:29:53] <EnginA> LordThumper: well, if you can control the iframe cotnent (as in your example), you can call a proxy page on the originating domain to call JS of the originator.
[07:30:01] <EnginA> the famous iframe hack
[07:30:02] <kontoo> pachet: hmmmm :P
[07:30:08] <seutje> etisfo: alert
[07:30:13] <seutje> hahahaha :')
[07:30:30] <alisson> LordThumper: But the iframes are from social networks, like Facebook and Pinterest
[07:30:32] <etisfo> seutje, can I pm quickly?
[07:30:38] <seutje> noplz
[07:30:45] <seutje> and not slowly either plz
[07:30:46] <LordThumper> LordThumper: Like I said doesn't work cross-domain
[07:31:01] <kontoo> pachet: well if I click on online, then all, then online again really fast
[07:31:04] <etisfo> seutje, okay.
[07:31:10] <kontoo> pachet: it sometimes does not change anything
[07:31:13] <LordThumper> LordThumper: You cannot interact between iframes easily cross-domain
[07:31:22] <seutje> there's a whole flippin channel here, stop asking me specifically
[07:31:47] <LordThumper> uff why am i talking to myself...
[07:31:51] <LordThumper> alisson:
[07:32:45] <etisfo> seutje, well is it possible to disable a button and add a class when it is not = or > 1? and remove when it is?
[07:32:57] <seutje> omfg

[07:35:46] <beefz0r> hi people
[07:35:58] <beefz0r> wow its dead here haha
[07:36:39] <beefz0r> can someone help me ?
[07:38:15] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm working on a magento site (which uses prototype). i've used jQuery.noConflict(), but when i try to call elements inside jQuery(function($){... i'm still not accessing them?
[07:38:24] <EdwardIII> it's like jquery is still getting called before the dom is ready
[07:39:14] <beefz0r> wait for the document to get ready ?
[07:39:59] <EdwardIII> beefz0r: isn't that what jQuery(function($){... does?
[07:40:40] <beefz0r> not sure, I'm kindof a jquery rookie
[07:41:18] <LordThumper> the noConflict shouldnt be in the dom.ready handler
[07:41:36] <LordThumper> read the docs
[07:42:00] <LordThumper> probably have the run it before loading other scripts
[07:42:04] <LordThumper> to run it*
[07:42:11] <EdwardIII> it's not: https://gist.github.com/3370673
[07:42:22] <beefz0r> I tried noconflict too and it didn't solve my problem
[07:42:25] <EdwardIII> #search-help is the element it can't find
[07:42:43] <EdwardIII> beefz0r: what's your issue?
[07:42:59] <beefz0r> it's solved already, problems with jquery not being loaded
[07:43:25] <beefz0r> now heres my problem today : I need to trigger a function when the innertext of an element changes
[07:44:23] <beefz0r> never mind, I found .change();
[07:44:42] <EdwardIII> awesome
[07:46:51] <beefz0r> oh great, what could possibly be wrong ?? $(".timer:first").change(function (){alert("lol")});
[07:48:02] <pachet> beefz0r: is '.timer:first' a form element that's being changed?
[07:48:11] <beefz0r> yes, the value
[07:48:28] <pachet> manually, or programmatically?
[07:48:29] <beefz0r> its a span
[07:48:31] <LordThumper> beefz0r: Are you changing with $(".timer").html() or .text() ?
[07:48:40] <pachet> a span is not a form element
[07:48:42] <LordThumper> If you use need to fire "change"
[07:48:53] <LordThumper> $(".timer").html("hello").change()
[07:48:59] <xckpd7> what's the best way to do 2 ajax requests? I'm using a url for a jsonp request, but I need to do a different path after the initial request. Not asking for the answer, just any resources would help
[07:49:02] <LordThumper> If so you*
[07:49:09] <pachet> beefz0r: what LordThumper said
[07:49:19] <xckpd7> I could easily do another ajax request, but don't know if there is a better way
[07:49:31] <pachet> then again, in that case using 'change' as your event name is an arbitrary choice
[07:50:01] <PKKid> xckpd7, Just call $.ajax twice?  They will both run at the same time, unless you put one inside the callback for the other.
[07:50:16] <LordThumper> ^ $(ele).on('hello', function () { }).trigger('hello')
[07:51:25] <beefz0r> well I am not sure how it is changed
[07:51:29] <lduros> any way I could simulate a rightclick on an element? The same way you do $('a').click()?
[07:51:56] <LordThumper> lduros: google
[07:51:57] <LordThumper> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6250447/trigger-right-click
[07:52:02] <LordThumper> 1st result
[07:54:27] <lduros> :-P
[07:54:37] <lduros> why would I google if I can just ask on the channel
[07:56:59] <faraway> why should the channel answer if you could google
[08:10:03] <codepython777>  I need a form where some of the elements are editable and some are not. The ones that are editable, I would like to provide a "edit-icon" on the left, and only when the user clicks that it shows the editable box with the value. Whats a good way to achieve this ?
[08:11:13] <Jon47> codepython777: there is a "disabled" property of inputs that can be toggled
[08:11:50] <Jon47> not actually sure if it's standard or well implemented in all browsers..
[08:11:51] <codepython777> Jon47: I did read about that -- and the browser side effect problems it causes
[08:11:57] <codepython777> was hoping someone had a JS library to do this?
[08:13:35] <Jon47> codepython777: what side effect problems does "disabled" cause?
[08:15:13] <cambazz> hello, i am using jquery validation, and using digits: true
[08:15:14] <codepython777> I dont remember right now
[08:15:29] <cambazz> while this works for positive numbers, it wont work for negative numbers
[08:15:31] <LordThumper> codepython777: You can try that with css
[08:16:05] <LordThumper> ele[disabled='disabled'] { background-image: 'edit-icon.png' }
[08:16:17] <LordThumper> ele[disabled!='disabled'] { background-image: 'edit-icon.png' }
[08:16:20] <LordThumper> last one
[08:17:09] <LordThumper> That way leave it up to the browser to display/hide the image
[08:17:32] <LordThumper> And just toggle the 'disabled' attribute when you need
[08:19:04] <LordThumper> Now that I read your message again, this won't work, as you cannot interact with the image
[08:30:09] <icjs> hi, any idea why the jquery typed into the console works, but doesn't work with out it (even when the same code is present in the source is in the page source)
[08:30:55] <timing> maybe because you run the jquery in the site to soon?
[08:31:11] <timing> before jquery is actaully initialised
[08:31:29] <icjs> timing, hmm, the function comes after the jquery src definition
[08:33:52] <rahmen> Can anyone explain this for me? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9395237/send-raw-file-data-from-input-type-file-over-ajax Was the extra information (3 first lines in second code paragraph) not sent pre html5? I don't get it... did they change how things are done or is he doing it the wrong way? I get the same extra info as he gets.
[08:36:56] <pachet> icjs: is the function dom-dependent? if so, you'll have to wait for the dom to be loaded
[08:37:04] <pachet> (or at least, the parts of it you need to touch)
[08:37:10] <timing> icjs: what pachet says
[08:37:51] <rgr> possibly/hopefully on topic but if it cant be done with jquery what do you recommend for a field I can freetype in OR select from a drop down?
[08:38:47] <icjs> pachet, sorry not sure what you mean by "dom-dependent". its referencing a select that occurs in the body code after
[08:39:11] <pachet> icjs: dom stands for Document Object Model
[08:39:22] <pachet> its the interface that javascript leverages to manipulate elements in the page
[08:39:22] <timing> icjs: does the code run in $(document).ready(function(){ /* here */ });
[08:39:29] <icjs> pachet, i wat for the page to be loaded, then change whats in the select list. but no alert or console.log is fired
[08:39:41] <icjs> when it ype the exact same code into the console i do get stuff happening
[08:40:29] <pachet> icjs: 99% sure that you're trying to call your function before that select has been added to the DOM
[08:40:47] <pachet> icjs: it would help if you could post your code somewhere for us to look at
[08:41:07] <icjs> pachet, ok thanks. let me pastebin
[08:42:52] <icjs> pachet, http://pastebin.com/yzZTkhzK
[08:43:37] <icjs> pachet, it's the id="quick_jumps" select list thats the problem
[08:43:46] <buscape> in my jQuery plugin i try to use .live( 'click', function()...)  in my init method but its not working... .click() works fine though
[08:43:57] <pachet> icjs: yeah, you're just trying to bind to that element before it exists in the dom
[08:44:23] <buscape> any thoughts?
[08:44:32] <pachet> icjs: wrap that code in $(function ( ) { /* dom-dependent stuff here */ }); like timing said, or just throw it before your </body> tag
[08:44:59] <buscape> if i trigger .live() on the same element in the console it works :O
[08:45:11] <icjs> pachet, ok thanks, will give it a try
[08:45:32] <pachet> buscape: i recommend using .on instead of .live
[08:45:37] <pachet> .live is deprecated
[08:45:37] <b-ot> pachet, memorised â€œliveâ€.
[08:45:42] <pachet> gah
[08:45:53] <pachet> ?forget .live
[08:45:56] <icjs> i reached for jquery here because i want the onchange to be corss-browser and the way it's currently implemeted is broken in firefox (ok in chrome/ie)

[08:46:26] <cambazz> -10, 10 ok, but 10.1 or aa is not
[08:47:11] <faraway> cambazz: value < 0 ?
[08:47:46] <faraway> cambazz: AH INTEGER
[08:48:00] <faraway> cambazz: damn caps lock :D
[08:48:56] <shoky> ?js [parseInt(-10) == -10, parseInt(-10.1) == -10.1]
[08:48:57] <bot-t> shoky: [true, false]
[08:48:59] <cambazz> faraway: yes, since jq validation plugins method for digits work wrong
[08:49:09] <faraway> cambazz: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/XcMGD/
[08:49:13] <cambazz> no that was not the question
[08:49:26] <icjs> ok i progress i get working alert onchange now, thanks timing and pachet . i went for the $(document).ready option
[08:50:31] <faraway> cambazz: what shoky wrote is the same i wrote in jsFiddle and it tests if it is an integer
[08:51:36] <pachet> no radix on those parseInts
[08:51:36] <pachet> zz
[08:51:47] <pachet> >>function check_int(string){return !isNaN(+string.replace('.','x')); }; (['foo', '-5', '5', '5.1']).map(check_int)
[08:51:52] <pachet> oh bleh
[08:51:54] <pachet> ?function check_int(string){return !isNaN(+string.replace('.','x')); }; (['foo', '-5', '5', '5.1']).map(check_int)
[08:51:55] <bot-t> pachet, Couldn't find "function check_int(string){return !isNaN(+string.replace('.','x')); }; (['foo', '-5', '5', '5.1']).map(check_int)" in jQuery Docs.
[08:52:03] <pachet> well, you get the idea
[08:52:39] <cambazz> faraway: shoky: yeah that worked nice. thank you
[08:52:47] <xckpd7> you can't do a click event on select options?!
[08:52:59] <xckpd7> not individial options, just select elements
[08:53:16] <faraway> cambazz: pachet is right add parseInt(value,10)
[08:53:34] <pachet> xckpd7: click event on an option will fire in some browsers, not all
[08:53:44] <pachet> xckpd7: as such, best not to rely on it
[08:54:09] <xckpd7> aww man, what the heck
[08:54:23] <pachet> .change() wont work for you?
[08:54:41] <xckpd7> pachet: I have 2 options... the 2nd option is populated with ajax based on the first element
[08:54:51] <xckpd7> when I click the first option again, I want the 2nd option to disable
[08:55:06] <xckpd7> otherwise it's not entirely obvious that the 2nd element was populated again
[08:55:24] <xckpd7> so I'm going to have to wrap it in a div and target that I suppose
[08:55:32] <pachet> xckpd7: when you say you have two options... do you mean you have two select elements?
[08:55:40] <pachet> or two options within a single select element :[
[08:56:14] <chrisbc> Does jquery work in mobile?
[08:56:21] <xckpd7> pachet: sorry 2 select elements
[08:56:30] <xckpd7> 2 select elements, one populates the other
[08:57:00] <xckpd7> when I reclick on that select element after the first time, I want the 2nd select element to disable
[08:57:09] <lduros> so no way to make something like this work: $('#blah').delay(1000).click();
[08:57:20] <lduros> it won't delay the click
[08:57:21] <pachet> ?g jquery mobile @ chrisbc
[08:57:22] <bot-t> chrisbc, jQuery Mobile | jQuery Mobile - http://jquerymobile.com/
[08:57:37] <xckpd7> pachet: and I just wrapped it in a div and targeted that... and it doesn't work...I have to do some sort of propagation / bubbling?
[08:58:03] <lduros> $.delay(function () {}); would work I guess
[08:58:24] <shoky> lduros: setTimeout(function() { $('#blah').click(); }, 1000)
[09:00:11] <batdorf> is there anything that would block .css('height', '100') from working? if I switch it to .css('color', blue') it works as expected
[09:00:32] <shoky> batdorf: you need 'px' or something
[09:00:38] <shoky> '100px'
[09:01:09] <shoky> (or 100%..)
[09:01:11] <pachet> lduros: $('#foo').delay(1000).queue(function(){$(this).click();});
[09:01:26] <shoky> don't you need to call next() or smth
[09:01:55] <pachet> yeah
[09:04:00] <pachet> lduros: what shoky's saying is this:   $('#foo').delay(1000).queue(function(next_queue_item){ $(this).click(); next_queue_item(); }).fadeOut()
[09:04:21] <pachet> calling that next_queue_item argument at the end of your queued function triggers the next item in the queue
[09:04:39] <pachet> means you can do all sorts of wacky stuff with passing around that callback ref
[09:04:51] <pachet> actually that's how promises work, if you've used those
[09:05:27] <pachet> lduros: alternatively you can omit that argument and just call .dequeue on the element
[09:06:20] <pachet> lduros: eg: $('#foo').delay(1000).queue(function(){ $(this).click().dequeue() }).fadeOut();
[09:06:37] <batdorf> px doesn't work either
[09:06:50] <jedimind> everyone remain calm, i am now here
[09:07:34] <pachet> batdorf: what's wrong with passing in an int
[09:07:43] <batdorf> actually though, shoky, i'm starting to think it's the order events are being called
[09:08:18] <shoky> calling .css('height',0) right afterwards, is an example of something that would "block" it, yes :P
[09:08:25] <batdorf> pachet: nothing should be wrong, but it doesn't work. i know there is a conflict going on, but i can't figure out what. i was hoping it was some known bug
[09:08:52] <batdorf> height: 100 is the last thing that should execute in my code
[09:08:57] <batdorf> *should*
[09:09:02] <shoky> batdorf: if you inspect your element in the elements/html view, what is its computed height?
[09:09:11] <shoky> or well, just its height
[09:09:36] <batdorf> something other than 100
[09:09:43] <batdorf> 448
[09:09:51] <batdorf> which is set prior to 100
[09:09:56] <batdorf> as expected
[09:09:57] <batdorf> but
[09:10:12] <batdorf> maybe the set to 448 is being done after, even though its earlier in the code?
[09:10:38] <shoky> depends on the order your functions/code parts are being called in
[09:11:06] <batdorf> the height:100 is last
[09:11:36] <batdorf> there is one line after that, which isn't related an .on('load) event
[09:11:48] <shoky> would need to see more code/a demo to help..
[09:11:53] <batdorf> where the height adjusts a third time
[09:12:04] <batdorf> i can visually see the third adjustment
[09:12:41] <batdorf> ok hold on
[09:14:15] <lduros> pachet: ah thanks
[09:15:22] <batdorf> it might be hard to follow through the code though
[09:15:25] <batdorf> http://kevinbatdorf.com/coda-slider-beta-dev/#5
[09:16:04] <batdorf> also, the 100px will eventually be dynamic, but i put it there just to get it to work
[09:16:10] <batdorf> which it doesn't
[09:16:50] <batdorf> it basically should do this. if there are no images in the div, immediately fix the height to match the height of the contents
[09:17:12] <batdorf> else if { fix it after, on load}
[09:21:57] <faraway> hmm, how can i access the native XMLHTTPRequest object in 1.8 ?
[09:22:02] <Atty> Im working with fullcalendar. I have a dialog and Im wanting to display all the slotMinutes  but im confused on how to put all this in a drop down any help.
[09:22:12] <shoky> batdorf: isn't the height being animated?
[09:22:17] <faraway> ideally in the beforeSend
[09:22:50] <shoky> batdorf: and the animation completes _after_ you set it to 100px
[09:23:31] <batdorf> it should only be animating after the page fully loads
[09:24:09] <batdorf> until then, the height of each panel is set to the height of the largest panel
[09:24:20] <batdorf> so it should be like this
[09:24:34] <batdorf> 1) set the height to the longest panel's height
[09:24:50] <batdorf> 2)immediately adjust panels with no images to their natural height
[09:24:57] <batdorf> 3)finally adjust loaded panels
[09:25:12] <shoky> is that a yes or no?
[09:25:30] <shoky> so what if it only animates after the page is fully loaded?
[09:25:40] <batdorf> sorry, i didn't read the second ques
[09:25:52] <batdorf> it should only animate after fully loaded, yes
[09:26:05] <shoky> so you have your answer?
[09:26:09] <batdorf> no
[09:26:10] <batdorf> haha
[09:26:16] <shoky> you set it to 100
[09:26:21] <shoky> and then it gets animated to something else
[09:26:22] <shoky> no?
[09:26:36] <batdorf> if you watch it, it never goes to 100
[09:26:40] <shoky> sure it does
[09:26:55] <shoky> you even console.logged it being 100
[09:26:58] <batdorf> what browser/os
[09:27:06] <shoky> win7 chrome..
[09:27:07] <batdorf> it doesn't show in chrome
[09:27:15] <batdorf> do you visually see it happening?
[09:27:41] <batdorf> yeah, the logs say 100, which makes me believe that it's happening out of turn
[09:27:49] <shoky> donno what im supposed to be seeing. i see the height animating
[09:27:53] <batdorf> perhaps there is a delay of some sort
[09:27:56] <SkiOne> hi, I am using the jqueryui modal dialog with tablesorter and the pager plugin, everything works except the pager plugin does not display the pages past page 1.
[09:28:03] <mikehaas763> I'm using jquery tools. I have figured out how to use the overlay. However, I would like to change the attribute that defines what "overlay" is displayed from rel="" to data-modal="". How do I do this?
[09:28:15] <batdorf> yeah, its animating from a height larger than 100px (448px i think)
[09:28:42] <batdorf> it should be 448 -> no animate 100 - > then animate to 88px
[09:34:54] <decoy98> hi everyone
[09:34:57] <shoky> batdorf: well that's sort of what's happening.. (just with different values here)
[09:35:04] <shoky> well the 100 is the same of course.
[09:35:18] <decoy98> does anyone here have a test script available to tes $.getScript?
[09:35:22] <shoky> batdorf: here after 100 it animates to 122 though
[09:36:35] <decoy98>  anyone here?
[09:36:36] <batdorf> i think its acting differently for me
[09:36:47] <batdorf> are you on panel 5 when you lad the page?
[09:37:02] <batdorf> load*
[09:37:06] <decoy98> panel 5?
[09:37:55] <shoky> batdorf: yeah
[09:38:30] <batdorf> so you see it moving up to 100px then back down to 122px?
[09:38:38] <batdorf> is it animating up?
[09:38:44] <batdorf> or are you going by the logging?
[09:38:50] <shoky> by debugging, yeah..
[09:39:03] <shoky> i don't see the jump
[09:39:22] <ScottG> How do I get the value of a checkbox? I could have sworn that $('.foo').val() works. I know I can use $('foo')[0].checked but I'd rather use the former.
[09:39:48] <LordThumper> $("#foo").is(":checked")
[09:39:51] <LordThumper> returns boolean
[09:40:33] <ScottG> LordThumper: Ahh ok I like that. What's the proper way to check a checkbox? I think that might be the issue I was having. I've previously checked it differently.
[09:40:54] <LordThumper> Not sure, I usually use that when I'm checking the state
[09:43:00] <LordThumper> Maybe $("#foo").attr("checked")
[09:43:32] <LordThumper> Or .prop even
[09:47:46] <ScottG> I'll make sure I standardize everything. Thanks for the help!
[09:50:44] <LordThumper> np
[09:53:02] <mikehaas763> I have the code $("tr").click()... What would I use to get a value from a certain td in that row?
[09:53:26] <mikehaas763> ^ * in the row that was clicked
[09:54:08] <LordThumper> $("tr").click(function () { console.log($(this).find("td.class").text()) });
[09:54:12] <kkuno> mikehaas763, $(this)
[09:54:26] <garciawebdev> +1 LordThumper
[09:54:29] <BillCriswell> You can also do $(this).find('td').eq(2).text();
[09:54:41] <mikehaas763> Ok thank you
[09:55:11] <mikehaas763> I didn't realize the $(this) object would refer to the tr
[09:55:31] <LordThumper> In the anonymous function this is the event caller
[09:55:35] <LordThumper> "this"
[09:57:13] <LordThumper> element that triggered/fired event
[09:57:15] <mikehaas763> Ah ok, the whole anonymous function are still really new to me one of these months I need to sit down with an advanced jquery/javascript book and catch up on these things.
[09:57:54] <garciawebdev> mikehaas763, there's not much science to it, they're just... well, functions without name...
[09:57:58] <LordThumper> Well an anonymous function is just a function without name
[09:58:15] <LordThumper> ^
[09:59:21] <LordThumper> Trying to do some node.js coding, that is when the fun starts. I cannot code async, all those callbacks
[09:59:26] <LordThumper> :/
[09:59:34] <mikehaas763> I understand that, but I could use some training in JS. I am a good OO programmer but it seems like when I look at inter-twined JS/jquery code it just makes me feel lost. Idk if it has to do with events throwing me off or what
[10:00:12] <snover> mikehaas763: maybe you want to use a toolkit that actually follows OOP principles
[10:00:16] <snover> instead of jQuery
[10:00:24] <snover> which is One Object To Rule Them All
[10:00:51] <mikehaas763> snover, I know but I'm afraid to leave the industry standard!
[10:01:05] <snover> what industry standard is that
[10:01:49] <mikehaas763> snover, just the fact that it is the most used by far and is used in the largest use cases
[10:02:10] <snover> largest use cases?
[10:02:40] <garciawebdev> mikehaas763, also, you may feel lost because most JS programmers or jQuery users are very disorganized in their messy code
[10:03:08] <garciawebdev> specially jQuery users
[10:03:10] <mikehaas763> as in, the largest projects typically use jquery.. I'm not making the statistics I'm just repeating them!
[10:03:36] <garciawebdev> well, the most used is not the best
[10:03:44] <garciawebdev> it's just, the most used
[10:03:55] <danzik17> mikehaas763: it may be the "standard" for DOM manipulation, but that doesn't mean it's the only thing you use.
[10:04:01] <garciawebdev> and that doesn't makes a standard
[10:04:03] <danzik17> backbone, underscore, ember.js, etc...
[10:04:12] <garciawebdev> right
[10:04:41] <mikehaas763> It's an "industry standard", which means the "industry" uses it the most by standard.
[10:04:54] <garciawebdev> there's lot of people using jQuery because it's the easiest and using jQuery plugins you don't have to learn JS
[10:05:07] <mikehaas763> What would you recommend?
[10:05:35] <garciawebdev> and there's a lot of people don't wanting to use it (like me) but had to bacause sharing codebase with coworkers
[10:05:47] <garciawebdev> but I drop it sometimes
[10:06:03] <garciawebdev> mikehaas763, well, it depends on what you need each time
[10:06:32] <batdorf> Where's a good resource to learn node.js ?
[10:06:55] <mikehaas763> danzik17, are you saying those all use jquery as their base?
[10:07:11] <NoiseEee> mikehaas763: you might also want to look into dojo and http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.8/declare/
[10:07:20] <danzik17> mikehaas763: they use jquery yes, but they don't have the same use case
[10:07:26] <danzik17> jquery solves dom manipulation really well
[10:07:31] <danzik17> it does NOT solve application structure
[10:08:19] <mikehaas763> There's just sooo many frameworks IDK where to start or pick one. I would like to start building RIA's but have a framework that handles the tedious tasks for me.
[10:08:23] <garciawebdev> Dojo seems great
[10:08:48] <garciawebdev> well, RIA concept is not hardly defined, but you can try Dojo or YUI
[10:08:51] <garciawebdev> for that
[10:08:53] <NoiseEee> mikehaas763: google google google, read opinions, and just make the plunge
[10:08:53] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: jQuery isn't a "framework" per se
[10:08:59] <ajpiano> mikehaas763: jQuery is more like a swiss-army knife
[10:09:07] <garciawebdev> +1 ajpiano
[10:09:08] <mikehaas763> ajpiano, ya I realize that
[10:09:18] <ajpiano> a very useful tool, but you can't use it alone to build an entire house
[10:09:18] <garciawebdev> as NoiseEee said, read a lot
[10:09:20] <mikehaas763> NoiseEee, I'm scared lol :(
[10:09:41] <mikehaas763> I'm off for lunch but I'll check the backlogs if anyone has anything else to say
[10:10:01] <garciawebdev> also, you can make your own glued toolkit, like picking libraries at hand for each task
[10:10:29] <garciawebdev> ie, Backbone for the MVC structure, Handlebars for templating, Sizzle for DOM querying
[10:10:58] <garciawebdev> $script.js or Loadrunner for dependency loading
[10:11:05] <snover> i would recommend not doing that. i have done that. it does not work out terribly well in the long run.
[10:11:08] <danzik17> or requirejs
[10:11:12] <garciawebdev> it depends on the level of control you want
[10:11:23] <snover> but it is an option.
[10:11:26] <garciawebdev> Dojo and YUI has everything in one package for you
[10:11:56] <garciawebdev> snover, would you prefer choosing something like Dojo or YUI?
[10:12:23] <snover> If you are making a web app, as opposed to a web site, dojo is probably the best choice
[10:12:28] <snover> but i might be biased
[10:12:56] <NoiseEee> heh ;)
[10:13:01] <danzik17> can't imagine why.
[10:14:07] <danzik17> ember.js looks tempting as well, but i can't get past the lack of really good documentation for it
[10:14:22] <garciawebdev> danzik17 same here!!
[10:14:50] <garciawebdev> had a week trying to figure out the beyond basics
[10:14:54] <garciawebdev> but couldn't
[10:15:00] <garciawebdev> so switched to Backbone
[10:15:15] <danzik17> garciawebdev: right.  the only examples i've really found are of TodoList style apps for ember
[10:15:21] <danzik17> but come on, no one writes stuff that simple.
[10:15:32] <garciawebdev> right
[10:15:38] <garciawebdev> I like Ember being more opinionated
[10:16:11] <garciawebdev> I like opinionated frameworks more than flexible-figure-out-architecture-yourself style of frameworks
[10:16:22] <garciawebdev> the problem is
[10:16:30] <garciawebdev> I found Ember tutorials for routing
[10:16:37] <garciawebdev> and for connecting with REST
[10:16:54] <garciawebdev> but that connectOutlets thing seems very esoteric for not being documented
[10:17:18] <garciawebdev> and couldn't glue all the concepts from two or three tutorials together
[10:17:56] <snover> chanserv so mean
[10:18:02] <danzik17> right.  nor do i really want to head to IRC or have to read the code every time i need to do something, simply because it's not documented.
[10:18:49] <ajpiano> danzik17: ya, stuff like that sounds more like a series of incantations that conjures a dragon, rather than opinionated :p[
[10:23:31] <Yield> is it a bad pratice to use only 1 accessor for each property ? (for instance, attribut: _x, getter X (), setter X(value)) ?
[10:26:41] <garciawebdev> danzik17, well, actually, you don't get too much help on the #emberjs channel
[10:26:48] <garciawebdev> they seem busy
[10:27:07] <danzik17> garciawebdev: even worse then ( i idle there, but don't actively read it )
[10:27:48] <Kolorbon> Can someone help me? I want to load a file by clicking on a button, then, with the same button to toggle the files display/visibility. http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/
[10:28:20] <garciawebdev> danzik17, the good thing is that they plan releasing the final 1.0 on september and also update the docs for that
[10:29:12] <garciawebdev> I was on the channel saying "hey, I want to write tutorials about Ember and spread the word, but help me understand it!"
[10:29:40] <garciawebdev> let's see what happends after the 1.0 comes out
[10:29:48] <garciawebdev> *happens
[10:30:05] <danzik17> yup.  for  now, i'm personally just sticking with backbone and backbone.marionette.
[10:30:31] <lilred> I'm using $.post to send stuff server side, but something bizarre happens - no matter what the response is, both the error() and success() callbacks are executed. Code sample: http://pastebin.com/FjjeT9bU
[10:30:35] <lilred> Any idea?
[10:30:44] <garciawebdev> danzik17, hey, I looked over Marionette on GitHub, but didn't tried it yet, is it good?
[10:31:28] <danzik17> garciawebdev: i just started using it like 2 days ago, so im not that deep into it.  let's just say i was extending Backbone.Views a lot and what i ended up with was really similar
[10:31:36] <danzik17> so i just scrapped my stuff and went with marionette
[10:31:44] <garciawebdev> nice
[10:31:58] <ajpiano> i use Backbone LayoutManager
[10:32:15] <garciawebdev> I didn't used Backbone too much yet, so leaved Marionette for later
[10:32:17] <danzik17> ajpiano: how does that compare?  ( if you've used marionette at all )
[10:32:24] <ajpiano> i haven't used marionette
[10:32:36] <ajpiano> but i really like layoutmanager :p
[10:32:47] <ajpiano> and i'm not biased cause i sleep on tbranyen's couch all the time
[10:32:53] <ajpiano> for the record :p
[10:34:31] <darkfrog> when you hit enter on an INPUT it simply clicks the closest button?
[10:34:56] <darkfrog> I would assume it should click the closest submit button
[10:37:35] <batdorf> what kind of webapps are you making?
[10:37:48] <Kolorbon> Can someone help me? I want to load a file by clicking on a button, then, with the same button to toggle the files display/visibility. http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/
[10:40:03] <darkfrog> batdorf: me?
[10:40:30] <garciawebdev> Kolorbon, updated your fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/1/
[10:40:33] <batdorf> anyone, just asking. I'd like to get into it but don't know what types of things you can build
[10:40:44] <garciawebdev> you can select the library on the left panel
[10:40:48] <darkfrog> ah, I figured it out...it was submitting a different button than I thought. :o
[10:40:59] <darkfrog> batdorf: you can build pretty much anything...
[10:41:09] <jedimind> anyone familiar with qwery selector engine ?
[10:41:25] <Kolorbon> garciawebdev, I dont see any change, except the removed jquery-file.
[10:41:34] <garciawebdev> look at the panel on the left
[10:41:42] <garciawebdev> it says jQuery 1.8.0
[10:41:44] <PKKid> jedimind, There are different levels of familiar, what are you trying to figure out?
[10:41:47] <Kolorbon> Ah.
[10:42:46] <jedimind> PKKid, something i wrote using qwery and ender is not working in safari
[10:42:53] <batdorf> darkfrog: what are you making?
[10:42:55] <jedimind> and it looks like its a core qwery selector issue
[10:43:11] <Kolorbon> garciawebdev, http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/2/ i changed the file to a link, does not work, also there is no error.
[10:43:12] <jedimind> selector.match(easy)
[10:43:17] <jedimind> but it could be any number of things im trying to eval through it
[10:43:28] <darkfrog> batdorf: well, I'm creating a web framework at the same time I'm writing an advanced web application for speaking events
[10:43:38] <empyreal> can I do an .each(function(){}) on a global variable?
[10:43:51] <nevin> Hello, is it possible to set and get cookies with javascript for a jquery plugin or just use jquery.cookie plugin since i'll be using jquery anyway?
[10:44:23] <batdorf> interesting
[10:44:38] <batdorf> how should I get started? backbone.js?
[10:45:06] <darkfrog> batdorf: but I'm primarily a Scala developer, so my web framework is meant to get around dealing with HTML and JavaScript as much as possible. :-p
[10:45:32] <batdorf> ah ;-)
[10:45:42] <darkfrog> batdorf: just learn jQuery and basic JavaScript to begin...if you want to add another framework later then do so, but jQuery and JavaScript directly should most likely be sufficient
[10:45:54] <garciawebdev> Kilorbon, http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/3/
[10:45:59] <garciawebdev> you had a extra semicolon
[10:46:00] <garciawebdev> also
[10:46:10] <darkfrog> at least to get you to the place where you can make better choices of what you want to learn next
[10:46:59] <garciawebdev> it returns a jQuery object, not true or false
[10:47:07] <batdorf> I think I have jQuery down pretty much, and I'm decent enough at vanilla javascript
[10:47:10] <Kolorbon> Ah.
[10:47:16] <garciawebdev> so you can't put a $.load() call inside a if
[10:47:25] <Kolorbon> Ok, and how then?
[10:47:47] <darkfrog> batdorf: why do you want to use something else?
[10:48:25] <garciawebdev> batdorf: learn vanilla JavaScript to the extent that you don't need any framework to do a project
[10:48:35] <Kolorbon> How can i check, if it is loaded, and, if it is, it should not load anymore, but toggle that loaded element.
[10:48:46] <batdorf> I want to build something more advanced
[10:48:56] <garciawebdev> batdorf: then, you can choose whatever you like but with plenty of experience for choosing right
[10:48:58] <batdorf> garciawebdev: good idea
[10:49:28] <batdorf> i bet this sounds dumb, but what can javascript do that jquery cannot?
[10:49:38] <batdorf> (on the front end)
[10:49:46] <garciawebdev> well, jQuery IS JavaScript
[10:49:53] <garciawebdev> so the answer is, yes
[10:50:01] <garciawebdev> it's not another language
[10:50:07] <garciawebdev> it's just a toolkit
[10:50:15] <garciawebdev> of convenient functions to use
[10:50:18] <batdorf> well i know that much
[10:50:19] <Zzaichik> dude, JavaQuery is it's own animal.
[10:50:25] <Zzaichik> ;p
[10:50:28] <batdorf> its cross-browser
[10:50:39] <batdorf> and easy to use
[10:51:30] <garciawebdev> yes, but if you want to dig deeper, you should know how to make an AJAX call without jQuery
[10:51:42] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: technically that is false.  jQuery is not JavaScript, but a framework built on top of JavaScript.  So, to a degree there is functionality jQuery as a framework lacks that can be accomplished in straight JavaScript, but the comingling of the framework should create no visible hindrance.
[10:51:47] <Zzaichik> jQuery is a JavaScript Library. So the answer is nothing. AJAX and JSON are
[10:51:48] <garciawebdev> and do it cross-browser
[10:52:09] <Zzaichik> â€¦good to know / use.
[10:52:37] <darkfrog> and alas jQuery is not perfectly cross-browser. :o  I seem to have a knack for finding those cases. :o
[10:52:54] <Zzaichik> Well, that's if you consider IE a browser I guess.
[10:52:56] <batdorf> lol true
[10:52:59] <garciawebdev> darkfrog, well, anything built on top of a language, is that language
[10:53:09] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: indeed...I wish I did not have to
[10:53:17] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: that is false
[10:53:20] <Zzaichik> haha - me too
[10:53:32] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: built using is not the same as being the language itself
[10:53:33] <batdorf> maybe better phrased "it's written in that language"
[10:53:37] <batdorf> but i get both points
[10:53:48] <garciawebdev> come on, you can't go out saying jQuery is not JS!
[10:53:57] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: I can
[10:54:13] <garciawebdev> ok, do it, no respected developer will talk to you, haha
[10:54:16] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: does Firefox have JavaScript support?
[10:54:34] <Zzaichik> It's built in JavaScript, you can write straight JavaScript in a jQuery script..
[10:54:37] <Kolorbon> darkfrog, uhm, jQuery is JS, doesnt matter, what anyone else says.
[10:54:40] <batdorf> So beyond learning vanilla javascript, should I look into backbone.js, node.js, or any of the above?
[10:54:44] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: this means I can invoke JavaScript on any page and it will work?
[10:55:00] <Zzaichik> batdorf: you should look into both of those
[10:55:04] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: however, since I cannot invoke jQuery in Firefox without the jQuery framework it is not the same thing
[10:55:18] <garciawebdev> I don't know where do you want to go
[10:55:21] <ajpiano> wat
[10:55:22] <b-ot> How can make this mutually exclusive using a jquery? Please help
[10:55:36] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: are you turning into Microsoft? :o
[10:55:43] <Kolorbon> garciawebdev, so can you help me with my problem?
[10:55:45] <garciawebdev> darkfrog: if you have 10 JS functions, are they JS function?
[10:55:48] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: "Where do you want to go today?" :o
[10:55:58] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: of course
[10:56:06] <batdorf> I think darkfrog is trying to say: you can use a jquery plugin without the jquery framework ;-) the syntax (language) isn't javascript
[10:56:13] <garciawebdev> darkfrog: if you namespace those functions, are they still JS functions?
[10:56:19] <batdorf> cant*
[10:56:23] <darkfrog> batdorf: he knows what I'm saying, he's just arguing against basic logic
[10:56:53] <darkfrog> garciawebdev: of course
[10:56:56] <batdorf> Zzaichik: where is a good place to start? Do you know any good books or any good websites?
[10:57:10] <Zzaichik> jQuery is a js LIBRARY - it's not a framework. Backbone is a framework. Angular is a framework.
[10:57:37] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: library and framework are synonymous in this area of programming
[10:57:40] <Zzaichik> batdorf: I think a good place to start would be Node.JS
[10:57:57] <Zzaichik> darkfrog: yeah I guess so. It was bothering me though. lol
[10:58:35] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: hehe, fair enough...I would agree in a more global programming context that "library" is more appropriate for the functionality that jQuery provides
[10:58:48] <Zzaichik> batdorf: I changed my mind. Getting familiar with a good MVC framework might be a better beginning route.
[10:59:27] <Zzaichik> â€¦so check out backbone.js
[10:59:30] <darkfrog> it's a shame they don't explicitly provide logic training to kids in schools these days...
[10:59:38] <Zzaichik> haha ^^^
[11:00:05] <wenzhixue> is there anyone built a facebook app before?
[11:00:16] <darkfrog> okay, back to work. :)
[11:00:25] <Zzaichik> fine. If I have to
[11:00:29] <Zzaichik> ;p
[11:01:26] <batdorf> Can anyone recommend a good place to pick up backbone? I don't want to just pick something off google if someone has any experience with something else
[11:02:32] <darkfrog> batdorf: go to their web site...they have tutorials there
[11:03:39] <Zzaichik> took the words right out of my mouth. AND, batdorf, familiarize yourself with MVC
[11:04:29] <batdorf> i should learn what MVC stands for first ;-)
[11:04:48] <batdorf> Thanks guys (girls?)
[11:04:57] <darkfrog> batdorf: and read up on why MVC is a deprecated pattern. :-p
[11:05:02] <CodesStuff> MVC = cancer
[11:05:13] * CodesStuff grabs popcorn to watch the rage rise within you
[11:05:17] <darkfrog> CodesStuff++
[11:05:46] <CodesStuff> Since I'm on a roll, nodejs sucks too, as does RoR
[11:05:49] <darkfrog> CodesStuff: at least they'll bring their torches and pitchforks to bear on both of us. :)
[11:06:24] <CodesStuff> If we're lucky they'll have to create a manifest file before they initialize the mob
[11:06:30] <CodesStuff> Giving us ample time to escape
[11:06:48] <darkfrog> hehe
[11:07:07] <CodesStuff> That was a mediocre joke at best. Don't patronize me with a "heh" :P
[11:09:08] <codepython777> does currentTarget have .text() always defined?
[11:10:18] <batdorf> what is everyone using to connect here on IRC?
[11:11:15] <Kolorbon> So can now someone help me?
[11:11:27] <aniasis> what do you need help with
[11:12:49] <Kolorbon> [19:37:46] <Kolorbon> Can someone help me? I want to load a file by clicking on a button, then, with the same button to toggle the files display/visibility. http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/3/
[11:13:12] <wenzhixue> i have a problem here, i built facebook app by iframe, its purely based on html5 and javascript, so when u go to www.cornerstore.me/priceit/ it will read the index.html , but after the facebook auth dialog and redirect to the original site, it will show "can not connect "
[11:13:39] <Kolorbon> I know now, that the code does not work in the if, but i dont know, how to write it correctly, aniasis
[11:14:38] <batdorf> I thought someone already helped you out
[11:14:53] <Kolorbon> Just with the if.
[11:14:54] <codepython777> $(".emailslist").on("click", "a.reqemail", function(e) {    e.preventDefault();    var emailclicked = e.currentTarget.text(); --> Will this work? Or this --> $("this").text() --> ? I'm trying to get to the email from the list emailslist
[11:16:22] <aniasis> yo jedimind.
[11:16:36] <batdorf> Kolorbon: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:16:41] <batdorf> i think that's what you want
[11:16:53] <batdorf> then you can remove the event from the button with off
[11:17:28] <Kolorbon> Ah, thanks, ill try it now.
[11:18:11] <batdorf> and i think you should use .on('load', instead of .load()
[11:18:53] <Symbi0nt|GER> is there one way/tool to check if a certain handler or event listener is bind to an object?=
[11:18:57] <Symbi0nt|GER> via console
[11:20:32] <echobravo> Symbi0nt: it's not via console, but i use http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[11:25:24] <jedimind> sup aniasis
[11:27:46] <Symbi0nt|GER> is there a way in firebug to see bound events?
[11:28:03] <Symbi0nt|GER> like functions in the jQuery object or something
[11:29:07] <codepython777> $(".emailslist").on("click", "a.reqemail", function(e) {    e.preventDefault();    var emailclicked = e.currentTarget -- what node does this refer to? Can I apply .text() to it?
[11:36:03] <gnarf> codepython777: $(e.currentTarget).text()
[11:36:14] <gnarf> codepython777: but it might not be what you want it to be
[11:36:20] <gnarf> $(this).text() is prolly what you want
[11:36:34] <gnarf> assuming you want the text of the "a.reqemail" that was clicked on
[11:36:49] <gnarf> where if there were any children that got clicked on, they would be the e.currentTarget
[11:37:58] <codepython777> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/VhBu3/16/
[11:38:04] <codepython777> Works on chrome, but not on firefox
[11:39:16] <codepython777> gnarf: $(this).text() works on both
[11:39:30] <codepython777> Why doesnt e.currentTarget.text() or innerText work?
[11:40:05] <CodesStuff> codepython777: use innerHTML for firefox
[11:40:14] <CodesStuff> just tested and it works fine.
[11:40:37] <CodesStuff> codepython777: http://blog.coderlab.us/2005/09/22/using-the-innertext-property-with-firefox/
[11:40:38] <CodesStuff> read that
[11:40:58] <codepython777> does that work with chrome and other browsers as well? It seems $(this).text() is cleaner?
[11:41:25] <CodesStuff> To be honest I'm not entirely sure, so if/when you find out, let me know :P
[11:42:02] <gnarf> codepython777: $(e.currentTarget) --- you can't call .text() (a jquery function) on a DOMElement
[11:42:33] <CodesStuff> GNARF HATH SPOKEN.
[11:42:52] <CodesStuff> I'm going to do that everytime you say something informative.
[11:43:12] <Kolorbon> xD
[11:43:15] <codepython777> gnarf: so in this situation $(this) is the right way to go?
[11:46:29] <Yiq> jQuery.get( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)] [, dataType] ) # can someone explain this to me? i dont get the types
[11:46:43] <Yiq> Cant I just link jQuery, do I have to download it?
[11:46:43] <codepython777> gnarf: so one could do $(e.currentTarget).get(0).text()?
[11:47:03] <codepython777> Yiq: you can link it from googles servers cdn
[11:49:26] <Yiq> what -?link
[11:50:16] <zoned> .live() documentation says it is deprecated and should be replaced with .on() ... however, for content dynamically inserted in the future, .on doesn't work. .live still does. what's the proper way to do this?
[11:52:40] <Yiq> Can i ask about d3 here?
[11:57:41] <Kolorbon> I rewrote it with .on, .off, but the .hide() does not work. http://jsfiddle.net/k9Zdu/7/
[12:02:14] <johnkpaul> Kolorbon: off is not the same as mouseup
[12:02:21] <NoiseEee> Kolorbon: its worth doing some tutorials before just mashing some code up
[12:03:00] <NoiseEee> i mean, mash/experiment away, but in terms of asking for help in a public channel... when folks see you are missing basic fundamentals, they will be much less inclined to help.
[12:03:53] <Kolorbon> ... I never heard from .on and .off ...
[12:05:10] <NoiseEee> Kolorbon: thats why there's documentation to help you along!  http://api.jquery.com/
[12:05:13] <Kambfhase> ignorace doesn't save you from penalty
[12:05:49] <Kolorbon> Uhm, I used the documentation du know how to use .on, how could i else bring that .on to work?!
[12:06:34] <Kolorbon> to*
[12:07:18] <ak> hm?
[12:08:18] <tubbo> hey guys, i can't get JSONP to work
[12:08:24] <tubbo> jQuery keeps trying to send my request over CORS
[12:08:29] <tubbo> using Chrome
[12:09:19] <tubbo> $.getJSON("#{root}/lead/new.json", {callback: "?"}, function(form) { tag.replaceWith(form.html));
[12:09:42] <tubbo> shouldn't that make a jsonp request, which is immune to CORS?
[12:12:00] <ak> Kolorbon: http://jsfiddle.net/tBEJL/2/
[12:12:01] <garciawebdev> shouldn't the server support JSONP?
[12:12:26] <tubbo> the server supports CORS, not JSONP. JSONP is basically a browser hack
[12:12:30] <tubbo> but i figured it out
[12:12:40] <Kambfhase> tubbo: wild guess: instead of having the callback in the object append it to the url
[12:12:42] <tubbo> you have to add ?callback= to the end of the URL param, not in the data object.
[12:12:49] <tubbo> haha Kambfhase good guess!
[12:13:06] <tubbo> i would say great minds think alike but i am an idiot so that would not be a compliment to you ;-)
[12:13:06] <Kambfhase> :D
[12:13:38] <Kambfhase> well, i just read the docs.
[12:14:36] <tubbo> and i have to use .ajax
[12:14:40] <tubbo> for some reason
[12:14:42] <Kolorbon> ak, thanks ;).
[12:14:49] <tubbo> using .getJSON is taking me back to CORS
[12:16:54] <zapsoda> Cork, do you rember my problum from last night? would this work? $(img).load(
[12:17:17] <Kolorbon> ak, the "gallery" that is loaded, is called "Supersized". So, when i click again onto the button, just the interface gets hidden, the fadeshow goes on.
[12:17:50] <ak> okay
[12:18:05] <Kolorbon> Is it possible, to remove the whole one?
[12:18:11] <ak> yes
[12:18:19] <Kolorbon> Or do I have to modify the gallery myself?
[12:18:38] <ak> you could just remove the gallery, and load it again ...
[12:19:02] <Kolorbon> Thats all i wanted xD.
[12:24:00] <hvgotcodes> is it possible to find out by how much an element is overflowing its parent?
[12:24:26] <hvgotcodes> i have a  div in a div.  The parent has a set height, the child expands to fit text.  Can i get how much over the child is going?
[12:25:02] <Brodingo> child height minus parent height
[12:26:18] <hvgotcodes> Brodingo: when i get the child, the height is the height of the visible part
[12:26:59] <hvgotcodes> oh maybe not
[12:27:58] <ak> Kolorbon: http://jsfiddle.net/tBEJL/4/
[12:28:08] <tubbo> so now i get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :" in my json endpoint route
[12:28:13] <tubbo> does JSON have string size limits?
[12:28:34] <tubbo> in Chrome, it cuts off HTML syntax highlighting inside the JSON String response after a certain point
[12:28:44] <tubbo> this is really a huge pain in the ass
[12:29:20] <dogarrhea2> so. facebook.  death by a thousand "lock up expirations" ?
[12:30:37] <zoned> .live() documentation says it is deprecated and should be replaced with .on() ... however, for content dynamically inserted in the future, .on doesn't work. .live still does. what's the proper way to do this?
[12:32:57] <Brodingo> zoned .on() should work, but the way theyre called is different
[12:33:10] <Brodingo> ?on
[12:33:10] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:33:11] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised â€œon()â€.
[12:33:12] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised â€œon()â€." in jQuery Docs.
[12:33:21] <jita> Why does $(this).closest('.class').attr('id') works but not (this).closest('.class').id ?
[12:34:02] <Brodingo> .id is not a method
[12:34:03] <b-ot> Brodingo, memorised â€œidâ€.
[12:34:19] <Brodingo> b-ot forget id
[12:34:20] <b-ot> Brodingo, I have forgotten â€œidâ€.
[12:34:34] <Brodingo> l
[12:35:40] <jita> so attr('id') is the way to go ?
[12:35:50] <Brodingo> yep
[12:36:30] <jita> ok thanks
[12:37:17] <Kolorbon> Thanks again ak, but all the pics where shown onto the page after the second click.
[12:40:04] <Kambfhase> tubbo: try this: http://jsonlint.com/
[12:49:46] <Eviltwin> ?on
[12:49:46] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:49:47] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised â€œon()â€.
[12:49:47] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised â€œon()â€." in jQuery Docs.
[12:50:24] <Kambfhase> -bot
[12:52:15] <zoned> Brodingo, http://pastebin.com/Tg9fj2Hb
[12:52:39] <zoned> replace .on with .live, it works. currently it only works with images loaded with the page but not dynamically inserted content
[12:53:13] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[12:53:15] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[12:53:27] <Eviltwin> Use .on or .delegate instead
[12:53:37] <zoned> ...i know. i am asking how to make .on work with dynamically inserted elements in the future
[12:53:44] <zoned> because it doesn't, unless i'm using it wrong
[12:53:58] <Kambfhase> read the docs
[12:54:07] <Eviltwin> It's explained on see ?.on
[12:54:08] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:54:10] <NoiseEee> zoned: you went backwards.  $('#someCommonParent').on('mouseenter','img.rollover',function() { etc } );
[12:54:12] <Brodingo> yeah, it tells you how to do delegated events
[12:54:28] <Eviltwin> And on ?see .live
[12:54:34] <Eviltwin> Err see ?.live
[12:54:34] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[12:55:15] <scientes_> how do i get an exact rev of jquery?
[12:55:22] <scientes_> i need rev 38 of 1.2.6
[12:55:25] <zoned> there's no commen parent... so just $("html") i guess?
[12:55:32] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery ?
[12:55:47] <Eviltwin> zoned: They tell you to use $(document)
[12:56:07] <scientes_> Eviltwin, this is 2008
[12:56:07] <Kambfhase> rev 38 of 1.2.6? Are you dealing with antiques?
[12:56:15] <scientes_> Kambfhase, dfsg
[12:56:22] <scientes_> i'm not even shipping it
[12:56:27] <Eviltwin> scientes_: Why in God's name are you trying to get an ancient version of jQuery?
[12:56:31] <scientes_> i'd just rather not repackage the source no not include the minified version
[12:57:33] <ajpiano> scientes_: jQuery 1.2.6 is jQuery 1.2.6, the rev # is irrelevant
[12:57:41] <scientes_> ajpiano, oh ok
[12:57:55] <scientes_> then illl just use the version from google apis? how is the rev irrelevent?
[12:58:13] <ajpiano> it's a historical artifact of when we were on svn
[12:58:18] <Eviltwin> Because you should never be using anything other than a release?
[13:01:50] <knite> how can I add an attribute to an element? in particular, I'd like to add "required" to some inputs in a form. the removeAttr() function works as advertised, but attr() will only add an attribute with a value. e.g., required="some_value", which isn't valid.
[13:03:09] <Kambfhase> try required=required
[13:08:54] <knite> Kambfhase: hm, that does seem to pass in an online validator.
[13:08:55] <knite> thanks!
[13:08:56] <Guilherme> is it possible to animate background-position?
[13:09:13] <Brodingo> Guilherme yep
[13:09:20] <Guilherme> how?
[13:09:28] <haizum> i have a dropdown menu that i'm activating by using the hover event (making its css display value turn to 'block' from 'none'). problem is, once i take my mouse off the link which triggers the event, it obviously disappears. i need for the hover event to remain active until my mouse leaves the new menu
[13:09:34] <Kambfhase> knite: you could also use .prop()
[13:09:55] <Brodingo> Guilherme https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[13:10:02] <Guilherme> i already try backgroundPosition, background-position-y
[13:10:08] <Kambfhase> ?demo @ haizum
[13:10:08] <bot-t> haizum, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:13:27] <w00nzs> heeeeeeeeeelpppppp
[13:13:30] <Guilherme> Brodingo, it's a plugin, right?
[13:13:44] <Brodingo> correct
[13:13:45] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ w00nzs
[13:13:45] <bot-t> w00nzs, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:13:53] <w00nzs> i need an function to end with my hangover
[13:13:58] <Brodingo> well, kinda
[13:14:05] <w00nzs> hangover.js
[13:14:11] <Brodingo> it just provides css hook support for background position
[13:14:57] <Kambfhase> w00nzs: $(this).on('hangover',function(){ $(this).end(); return false;}); TIAS
[13:15:09] <Yiq> whats the address to jQuery?
[13:15:11] <Yiq> url
[13:16:35] <Brodingo> Yiq see topic
[13:17:45] <Kambfhase> Mmmm, Guinness
[13:28:10] <daurnimator> if I have an input (text) element; how do I fill it in?
[13:30:19] <mysphyt> ? val @ daurnimator
[13:30:19] <bot-t> daurnimator, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:32:09] * daurnimator finds .attr("value","something else")
[13:32:21] <daurnimator> mysphyt: I wanted to edit it; not grab the value?
[13:32:53] <daurnimator> oh that works too (.val)
[13:33:49] <mysphyt> daurnimator: Click the link. There's an optional value parameter that allows you to pass a new value. So .value("Bananas") will set the contents to "Bananas."
[13:42:07] <Trisox> any one know how to use on() and touch events?

[13:48:46] <ryanneufeld> weeeeeeee
[13:57:24] <jita> whats wrong with this code http://dpaste.org/7NaZ0/ ?
[13:57:56] <Kambfhase> what the problem?
[13:58:21] <jita> Kambfhase, the div will slide up, and slide down again
[13:58:46] <jita> Kambfhase, http://jsfiddle.net/N7tvx/ can make this work though
[13:59:41] <Kambfhase> toggleUp()? did you mean slideToggle() ?
[14:00:36] <jita> Kambfhase, it does not work either
[14:01:01] <jita> Kambfhase, its SlideUp i think
[14:02:10] <jita> Kambfhase, ok i made it work by using .css(display: none)
[14:02:43] <Kambfhase> pro tip: use .hide()
[14:04:13] <jita> Kambfhase, doesnt work
[14:04:47] <Kambfhase> doesn't work is not a valid problem description.
[14:06:05] <jita> Kambfhase, even if i do this $(this).closest(".box").css(''); it works
[14:06:29] <Kambfhase> you should not do that.
[14:06:31] <jita> Kambfhase, but if i use hide, toggle or anything, it just does not disappear
[14:07:07] <jita> Kambfhase, i will show you the problem then wait
[14:07:12] <Kambfhase> That is weird, to say the least
[14:12:25] <Ziggy`> I need a plugin for autogrow on textareas, I need it to support submit on enter, and shift+enter to make a new line, Any suggestions?
[14:15:01] <michel_v> yo
[14:15:42] <imsky> hay dawg
[14:16:14] <jita> Kambfhase, you there ?
[14:16:21] <Kambfhase> nope
[14:16:25] <jita> lol
[14:17:46] <jita> Kambfhase, once you login the page, you will see  the flag icon
[14:17:51] <jita> Kambfhase, thats where the problem lies
[14:17:54] <konr_trab> A checkbox has the value "on" no matter if its on or not. Any idea of what is going on?
[14:18:15] <Kambfhase> konr_trab: go for 'checked'
[14:18:48] <konr_trab> Kambfhase: thanks!
[14:19:44] <Jon47> Kambfhase: .prop('checked')
[14:19:55] <Jon47> er.. konr_trab
[14:20:02] <Kambfhase> :/
[14:21:59] <chovy> i have an array of objects...i want to loop through each object and figure out if one of the items has a value. If it does...I want to set a flag. Is there a way to do this?
[14:22:22] <chovy> imagine a list of books. and there is a flag isEbook.
[14:22:38] <chovy> I want a flag that says "collectionHasEbook" if there is one found.
[14:25:10] <jrockjiggz2> var collectionHasEBook = false; $.each(booksObj, function(i, e){ if(e.isEbook){ collectionHasEBook = true; } }); //something like this....
[14:29:51] <TheWarden> Hi, can one use jQuery to produce a layer like the famous lightbox?
[14:30:28] <TheWarden> If I can do this, can this be done using jQuery or jQuery UI or do I need a plugin? Any direction on this would be greatly appreciated.
[14:30:43] <jita> Kambfhase, i fixed the issue
[14:30:49] <chovy> jrockjiggz2: yeaht. thatnks.
[14:31:10] <Kambfhase> okay
[14:31:46] <TelFiRE> Hi guys. is there any way in jquery to target only immediate children? Eg, I have <ul class="top"><li><ul><li> and I want to select immediate LIs within .top but NOT LIs within ULs that are in .top
[14:32:26] <Kambfhase> "ul > li"
[14:32:28] <antishok> ?child-selector
[14:32:30] <bot-t> antishok, Child Selector (“parent > child”) - Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[14:32:40] <Kambfhase> "ul.top > li"
[14:34:02] <jita> Kambfhase, if i use event.stopPropagation it works then
[14:34:56] <Kambfhase> then do that. i think the rpbolem is that you toggle upen the click on a parent element
[14:35:04] <Kambfhase> *problem
[14:35:51] <jita> yeah
[14:36:01] <TelFiRE> as simple as that eh? sweet, thanks Kambfhase
[14:36:23] <Kambfhase> warnign: orthokraphy levell down too 10%. Please refilll!
[14:37:50] <TheWarden> anyone?
[14:38:35] <Eviltwin> TheWarden: You can but jQuery itself doesn't have anything built-in for it
[14:41:43] <ta> guys, i am looking at the following jquery code snippet:
[14:41:51] <ta>    printf("<script> \
[14:41:51] <ta>           $(function() { \
[14:41:51] <ta>                 $( \"input:submit\" ).button(); \
[14:41:51] <ta>                 $( \"input:reset\" ).button(); \
[14:41:51] <ta>              }); \
[14:41:52] <ta>       </script>\n");
[14:42:05] <ta> what does the .button method do?
[14:42:22] <TheWarden> Eviltwin: okay, so what would you suggest to use then for a plugin or don't bother and use lightbox or something else without jQuery?
[14:42:28] <ta> i looked at the jquery documentation, but that method is documented to have arguments
[14:42:44] <ta> in this code there are no arguments
[14:44:11] <ta> i am guessing the .button() puts the button into a default state, but i'm not sure ...
[14:45:43] <Eviltwin> ta: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[14:45:59] <Eviltwin> You need jQuery UI's JavaScript and CSS to give it style
[14:48:02] <ta> EvilTwin: thanks for the link. I am looking at the documented methods, but all of them have some argument
[14:48:36] <Eviltwin> Click "View Source" below the example box
[14:55:09] <sunbeam> how can i best include google maps (with provided address) with 200x200px in my site?
[15:01:45] <Eviltwin> sunbeam: That's not a jQuery question but I'll point you at some examples anyway: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/
[15:02:59] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:03:30] <sunbeam> Eviltwin: i dont see any js code
[15:03:47] <sunbeam> or e xamples of embed code
[15:03:56] <Eviltwin> Then you need to learn how to view the source of a website
[15:04:58] <sunbeam> of a flash page
[15:05:03] <sunbeam> i dont see, i cannot right click
[15:05:26] <Eviltwin> Good thing there's no browser where right clicking is the only way to view the source of a web page
[15:05:56] <sunbeam> I don't see how in firefox
[15:06:08] <sunbeam> Apart from Firebug which i havent installed here

[15:07:03] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ strglin_jqry_usr
[15:07:04] <bot-t> strglin_jqry_usr, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[15:07:56] <strglin_jqry_usr> Okay, yes
[15:08:07] <strglin_jqry_usr> Assuming the two URLs are the same (host, and iframe)
[15:08:25] <strglin_jqry_usr> the contents().find('#some_id').html('test'); is not working
[15:08:49] <strglin_jqry_usr> is there a delay that is impacted
[15:09:02] <strglin_jqry_usr> when you do, $(function(){, does that also wait for the iframe to load
[15:09:28] <TelFiRE> Hi guys.... Anyone mind checking out my fiddle and seeing if you have an idea for what approach I should use http://jsfiddle.net/EQzM7/
[15:10:50] <TelFiRE> Obviously all buggy right now but the idea is to drill down into the sub-links, like mobile interfaces. Not sure how to properly select and animate the sub-uls, and make it work infinitely without a ton of manual code for specific cases
[15:11:23] <Eviltwin> strglin_jqry_usr: No, it does not wait for the iframe to load
[15:11:35] <TelFiRE> Oh and my slide toggle is jumpy. Not my main concern but if anyone can see why it'd be appreciated
[15:11:38] <Eviltwin> You need to find the frame and do .load(function() { ... })
[15:11:41] <strglin_jqry_usr> Eviltwin: so thats the issue probably
[15:11:48] <strglin_jqry_usr> $('#preview').load(function(){ });
[15:11:48] <strglin_jqry_usr> ok
[15:12:27] <strglin_jqry_usr> lmao
[15:12:42] <strglin_jqry_usr> $(function(){ $('#preview').function(){  ... }) }) worked
[15:12:46] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:13:01] <strglin_jqry_usr> okay, new issue
[15:13:25] <Zzaichik> aye aye aye
[15:13:58] <strglin_jqry_usr> this is not working:http://pastie.org/private/bk0jy7mdes7mrybbhypya
[15:14:12] <strglin_jqry_usr> well, it works, but basically when a user changes a textarea, it will only append the LAST change
[15:14:33] <strglin_jqry_usr> so if user1 replaces "A" with "B" and then "B" with "C", the iframe will show "B"
[15:14:40] <strglin_jqry_usr> it's not live, immediate, etc
[15:15:00] <strglin_jqry_usr> it makes the previous change, not the immediate change
[15:15:38] <Yiq> can someone show me how to jQUery a site? for exmaple: http://perstajson.appspot.com/
[15:19:46] <TelFiRE> lolwut
[15:20:16] <Yiq> jQuery.get that is
[15:20:26] <Yiq> or .getJson
[15:20:39] <strglin_jqry_usr> $.get
[15:20:46] <strglin_jqry_usr> if you wanna be a cool kid
[15:21:46] <Yiq> params?
[15:22:28] <Yiq> $.get("http://perstajson.appspot.com/", ...?
[15:22:47] <TelFiRE> not sure if this will work but
[15:22:48] <TelFiRE> get?
[15:22:54] <TelFiRE> nup
[15:23:05] <TelFiRE> ?get
[15:23:05] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[15:24:06] <Yiq> $.get("http://perstajson.appspot.com/", "", callback, "json");
[15:25:01] <MistuhKurtz> A common problem with on/event delegation is that 'this' no longer refers to the element that was clicked, but the parent element you're looking for the event to bubble up to. How do you access the element that was clicked? is it event.currentTarget ?
[15:28:23] <MistuhKurtz> ?tias
[15:28:23] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:28:26] <TelFiRE> I've had lots of problems with slidetoggle before, but they always relate to padding or margins or something and the animation is just jumpy, but basically works. Now on this one, it opens and closes with absolutely no animation. Any clues or has anyone seen this before
[15:28:28] <MistuhKurtz> works :P
[15:31:15] <Yiq> $.get("http://perstajson.appspot.com/", "", callback, "json"); ?? i get an object back but i dont know if it works, i tried to print it it is just object then
[15:32:55] <NomadJim> when using .append(), which thing is the most standard for adding an item to a list: jQuery generated element, an HTML string, javaScript DOM generated element?

[15:35:15] <TelFiRE> I don't like sushi, but this is some oksushi
[15:36:56] <Zzaichik> you shut your mouth when you're talking to me
[15:37:02] <TelFiRE> Is there a way to get the "width including border" on a percentage-based div
[15:37:17] <Zzaichik> outerWidth() ??
[15:38:26] <TelFiRE> can I say animate({left:'-=outerWidth()'},1000); or something similar
[15:39:08] <Zzaichik> I would set the element's outer width to a variable
[15:39:28] <TelFiRE> my concern is setting that variable on document load, then they resize their browser and it's no longer correct
[15:39:45] <Zzaichik> it should actually adjust.
[15:39:58] <Zzaichik> or no - you'll have to have it recheck
[15:40:09] <Zzaichik> so you'd have to capture that resize event  .resize()
[15:40:36] <TelFiRE> well actually
[15:40:40] <TelFiRE> if I set the var inside the click function
[15:40:45] <TelFiRE> it would recalc every time they click right?
[15:40:50] <Zzaichik> right
[15:41:04] <TelFiRE> oy but if they do click, then resize, then click down further that could cause extreme weirdness
[15:41:11] <TelFiRE> i'll just tias I guess lol
[15:41:38] <Zzaichik> yeah there are lots of scenarios that could cause craziness - but it sounds like you are on the right path.
[15:43:03] <manster1> I'd like to know how to prevent the letter spacing attribute from creating additional padding at the blank space at the end of the words in my menu
[15:43:23] <manster1> if you try shrinking my site, you'll see that as the pages width shrinks, the links with the most wordspacing are pushed down to the bottom
[15:43:54] <manster1> if you shrink the page horizontally, first the browser pushes the "h  e  y" link down because it has the most trailing space, then when the "d r a w" trailing space exceeds its contaier: "d  r a w" "s h o o t" and "b o u t" links are all pushed down at the same time  http://jordanstabile.webu.us
[15:44:51] <TelFiRE> I don't know if I can ever get these calculations correct... I really wish I could just say "-100%" which is exactly what I want, but it's not really doing 100% it's more like 95%
[15:47:09] <Lanubya> Hello i have a problem: I wanna open a jQuery UI Dialog from another jQuery UI Dialog. The first Dialog opens with no problems. but if I click on the next button to open the next dialog nothing happens. any ideas?
[15:47:37] <garciawebdev> is there any way with jQuery selector to select an element that's not the child of another?
[15:48:03] <garciawebdev> like ":not(:childOf(.container)) .container"
[15:48:12] <garciawebdev> sorry
[15:48:21] <garciawebdev> like ".container:not(:childOf(.container))"
[15:48:25] <garciawebdev> something like that
[15:48:39] <garciawebdev> I need to select a container that's not child of another container
[15:48:52] <TelFiRE> ?not
[15:48:52] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:49:10] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE, how can I apply that?
[15:49:46] <garciawebdev> to my case?
[15:50:00] <TelFiRE> jQuery('div').not('.green') I don't really know what your case is
[15:50:09] <TelFiRE> that would select all divs that don't have the class 'green'
[15:50:38] <garciawebdev> I know not(), but I need elements that are not child of a selector
[15:50:47] <garciawebdev> like ".container:not(:childOf(.container))"
[15:51:01] <garciawebdev> all .container that are not child of .container
[15:51:07] <garciawebdev> is that possible?
[15:51:13] <garciawebdev> with selectors?
[15:51:24] <TelFiRE> well with what you just said it would be
[15:51:37] <TelFiRE> jQuery('.container').not('.container .container') I think?
[15:52:24] <TelFiRE> as to whether you can use childOf inside of a not, I'm not sure, but wouldn't that basically be the same thing
[15:52:28] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE nope
[15:52:47] <garciawebdev> didn't worked
[15:52:58] <garciawebdev> :childOf is an example of what I would need, it doesn't exists in jQuery API
[15:53:22] <TelFiRE> so you want to select .containers that are inside other .containers, but just not the immediate children?
[15:53:24] <Zzaichik> $('.element').not('.element').children('child');
[15:53:29] <Zzaichik> kind of?
[15:53:44] <Zzaichik> that doesn't look right..
[15:53:46] <TelFiRE> well nothing would ever match that
[15:53:50] <ajpiano> garciawebdev: use .filter(function() { });
[15:53:50] <TelFiRE> all .elements are .element lol
[15:53:57] <garciawebdev> TelFiRE, I need .container that are not inside of another .container
[15:54:10] <ajpiano> or not
[15:54:24] <TelFiRE> ok well that's what jQuery('.container').not('.container .container')  should do.... it will select every ".container" on the page that is not inside another '.container'
[15:54:26] <ajpiano> $(".foo").not(function() { return $(this).closest(".bar"); });
[15:54:35] <ajpiano> $(".foo").not(function() { return $(this).closest(".bar").length; });
[15:54:35] <Zzaichik> ^^ nice
[15:54:43] <Zzaichik> That looks better.
[15:55:04] <ajpiano> and you can do any sort of complex filtering in that function that you need
[15:55:15] <ajpiano> so you can actually check if it's physically in a particular element, not just in a selector, for instance
[15:55:25] <Zzaichik> garciawebdev: ^^
[15:55:45] <garciawebdev> ajpiano, thanks, let me check
[15:57:25] <garciawebdev> ajpiano, seems not working: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xIhzf
[15:57:51] <ajpiano> garciawebdev: cause .closest checks the element itself
[15:57:56] <ajpiano> as it turns out
[15:58:01] <ajpiano> yuo'll have to use .parents()

[16:56:01] <ryanneufeld> acid, twice
[16:56:04] <coldhead> not very common round these parts
[16:56:11] <ryanneufeld> would not recommend
[16:56:25] <coldhead> i did acid most weekends for a few years
[16:56:32] <coldhead> it made me the fine figure of a man i am today
[16:56:44] <Zenoture> hey all, first time here asking a question so, hello! ^__^ Anyways, I have a question about a demo I saw on the jquery website (date picker). How would I go about using that exact ui and everything on my website?
[16:58:20] <Zenoture> the link to the date picker in question: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[16:59:06] <coldhead> Zenoture: if you copy their code, include the same JS files and include the same stylesheet you should see the exact same thing
[16:59:41] <ifdef42> Chrome is suddenly driving me insane: i save a .js file, and hit f5 and it still sees the old version... unless i clear cache in settings
[17:00:01] <Zenoture> ah tyty coldhead
[17:00:25] <coldhead> shift refresh, ifdef42 ?
[17:01:02] <ifdef42> yeah, doesn't seem any different than f5. shift, ctrl, ctrl-shift... same with the clicking the reload button. nothing.
[17:01:32] <ifdef42> i upgraded from ubuntu 11.04 to 12.04 recently, but my chromium 18 and chrome 21 haven't changed. both doing this now.
[17:01:37] <zapsoda> Why isnt the loading screen coming up first thing? my site is: http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ my code is: http://pastebin.com/vjW6XWL3
[17:01:38] <coldhead> damn
[17:01:52] <coldhead> ifdef42: something awful in the cache header from the server perhaps?
[17:02:12] <ifdef42> this started off with file:, local files...
[17:02:30] <ifdef42> i tried moving it into a web dir on the same machine through Apache and disabling cache, doesn't seem to help
[17:02:35] <coldhead> guh
[17:02:42] <coldhead> ask in #chromium maybe?
[17:03:00] <antishok> ifdef42 you can always disable cache temporarily in the devtools options
[17:03:03] <ifdef42> ooh thx, i looked for #chrome and #googlechrome but didn't try #chromium :)
[17:03:45] <zapsoda> ifdef42, maybe  #chromium-support
[17:06:34] <zapsoda> Why isnt the loading screen coming up first thing? my site is: http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ my code is: http://pastebin.com/vjW6XWL3
[17:06:45] <oojacoboo> so, can you edit your js in Chrome's console and test the changes?
[17:07:00] <oojacoboo> or do you have to edit the file and reload it in
[17:07:30] <oojacoboo> I'm pretty sure I saw a video cast on editing in the console
[17:08:54] <oojacoboo> but it seemed like it was more about writing new code, not editing existing code
[17:09:53] <antishok> zapsoda: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/20/
[17:10:00] <antishok> oops i meant Zenoture ^^
[17:10:13] <coldhead> oojacoboo: i think i saw a paul irish demo of saving out CSS but i don't think i've seen it with JS. i've never used it in either case
[17:10:38] <oojacoboo> coldhead, yea, I think we might seen the same video
[17:11:06] <oojacoboo> editing ajax UI's sucks though b/c you have to refresh the page and load get back to where you were
[17:11:09] <Lanuyba`> i have a problem: I wanna open a jQuery UI Dialog from another jQuery UI Dialog. The first Dialog opens with no problems. but if I click on the next button to open the next dialog nothing happens. http://pastebin.com/uz3xqyDp
[17:11:24] <oojacoboo> it'd be AMAZING if you could edit the js and have the browser load the assets into memory
[17:11:34] <oojacoboo> without having to make a new httpd request
[17:11:49] <zapsoda> Why isnt the loading screen coming up first thing? my site is: http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/ my code is: http://pastebin.com/vjW6XWL3
[17:20:42] <antishok> zapsoda: your html file is 390kb, it takes a while until the DOM is ready
[17:21:01] <oojacoboo> when someone builds an IDE extension that allows you to edit files inside the browser's memory, then invoke the browser to refresh them somehow, without having to pull in all the assetsâ€¦ web dev will be awesum
[17:21:12] <zapsoda> Is 390kb alot for a html file?
[17:21:21] <antishok> i'd say so
[17:21:37] <antishok> anyway if you want something to be shown right away
[17:21:40] <zapsoda> How can i make it start right away
[17:21:41] <antishok> then don't load it with javascript
[17:21:48] <zapsoda> How do i load it?
[17:21:54] <antishok> put it on the page with html/css first thing, then remove it with javascript..
[17:22:01] <antishok> or something
[17:24:04] <antishok> or show it with javascript in a script tag up top, would prolly be better
[17:26:06] <ThrushAAX> oojacoboo: you can do that through any browser dev console
[17:26:25] <ThrushAAX> oojacoboo: it just needs to be on the window object or a global variable
[17:32:37] <oojacoboo> ThrushAAX, that sounds pretty limited
[17:32:45] <ThrushAAX> it is
[17:33:05] <ThrushAAX> I would only really use it for like one function at a time
[17:33:57] <ThrushAAX> although if I was using a subscribe/publish model it would be really easy to swap functions in and out
[17:35:05] <oojacoboo> then it's pretty much worthless
[17:35:09] <ThrushAAX> or anything event driven
[17:35:10] <ThrushAAX> just unbind
[17:35:17] <ThrushAAX> then copy in your new function and rebind
[17:35:20] <ThrushAAX> pretty simple
[17:39:17] <twisted`> yo I'm using a script on a side that seems to conflict... now I thought ok jQuery.noConflict(); should fix this -but- it just somehow breaks the code. This is the code in question: (it's gpl code so no worries) http://pastebin.com/QQ5LGL6V
[17:39:50] <twisted`> but, I can't figure out why it wouldn't work. If I place jQuery.noConflict(); in front of it the site works normally like it did (mootools) but then this script just... doesn't
[17:40:24] <ThrushAAX> you are using jQuery inside of the script body
[17:40:26] <ThrushAAX> line 6
[17:40:42] <oojacobo_> twisted`, use namespaces/scopes
[17:41:14] <twisted`> ThrushAAX: so all the jQuery bits need to be replaced with a $ ?
[17:41:27] <twisted`> I'm just tryin to hotfix a script :) didn't write it myself!
[17:41:30] <ThrushAAX> with an `a` apparently
[17:41:41] <ThrushAAX> to start with
[17:43:23] <twisted`> I'm terribly sorry I know your just trying to help but I have atm NO idea what your talking about :D haha I guess those few months I didn't do JS is now biting me in the ass
[17:43:43] <twisted`> I find this code horrible to read so...
[17:45:05] <ThrushAAX> in line 6 replace the 'jQuery' with an 'a' and see if it helps
[17:45:06] <raj> antishok = shoky?
[17:45:25] <antishok> lul ye
[17:45:28] <shoky> didn't notice
[17:45:47] <shoky> sup rajy
[17:46:39] <twisted`> ThrushAAX: nope... it still works if I don't type in the jQuery.noConflict(); so it's on the right track :)
[17:48:09] <twisted`> I now tried: var $j = jQuery.noConflict(); and replace the jQuery with $j
[17:49:28] <twisted`> (also didn't work)
[17:49:51] <twisted`> well it's no real biggie I can replace the menu system with a CSS based one and then the mootools dependency is gone
[17:50:14] <ThrushAAX> always the best idea ;)
[17:50:44] <twisted`> still loads for reasons unknown but who cares
[17:51:11] <codepython777> apart from firebug, is there any other firefox plugin that you guys recommend using for jquery?
[17:53:21] <rgr> possibly someone here can help. Ive created a pop up editor with a z index of 9999 using jquery but a control with an embedded flash slideshow (picasa slideshow) that lies under the editor is STILL showing the slideshow on top of the editor thus obscuring the editor controls. Any know workaround/fix preferably using jq?
[17:54:32] <ThrushAAX> rgs: you need to use the iframe fix
[17:54:56] <rgr> ?
[17:55:19] <rgr> or maybe I can disable the underlying fields (all tagged with a certain class so trivial with jquery)
[17:55:46] <ThrushAAX> bgiframe is a good plugin
[17:56:39] <oojacobo_> rgr there is a flash command for that
[17:56:54] <ThrushAAX> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515939/flash-on-top-of-jquery-dialog
[17:56:57] <oojacobo_> it's been a whileâ€¦ wg_transparent
[17:57:00] <oojacobo_> or something like that
[17:57:21] <oojacobo_> wmode="transparent"
[17:57:48] <oojacobo_> flash variable rather*
[17:58:17] <rgr> ThrushAAX: thanks didnt spot that one
[17:58:38] <oojacobo_> you do NOT need to use some iframe fix
[17:58:43] <oojacobo_> that's just incorrect and bad advice
[17:59:23] <ThrushAAX> yeah, that was the old way of doing things
[17:59:35] <ThrushAAX> iframe fix is for other ie6 zindex issues
[17:59:52] <oojacobo_> yep 8 years ago
[17:59:56] <oojacobo_> :P
[18:01:06] <rgr> so how do I set wmode? I can also do it in my hierarchy like this : $(".centercontainer .embed > *").css("display","none");
[18:01:17] <oojacobo_> rgr, it's a FLASH variable
[18:01:19] <rgr> but thats turning off them all
[18:01:20] <oojacobo_> like I stated
[18:01:30] <oojacobo_> rgr #flash
[18:01:35] <rgr> right, and that means nothing to me. I dont know anything about flash.
[18:01:42] <oojacobo_> rgr, then don't use it
[18:01:45] <rgr> so theres no built in jquery interface
[18:02:02] <oojacobo_> rgr, you are using flash, either deal with it or use something else
[18:02:12] <rgr> You're onstructive and rude.
[18:02:39] <oojacobo_> Oo
[18:02:49] <ThrushAAX> its an attribute for the flash embed tag
[18:03:03] <ThrushAAX> read tghe stackoverflow link
[18:03:04] <rgr> (for others less abrasive, Im not personally using flash : flash is one possibility of whats in an embedded dive put in there by the user)
[18:03:14] <Lanuyba`> i have a problem: I wanna open a jQuery UI Dialog from another jQuery UI Dialog. The first Dialog opens with no problems. but if I click on the next button to open the next dialog nothing happens. http://pastebin.com/uz3xqyDp
[18:03:16] <rgr> ThrushAAX: I will, thanks.
[18:03:56] <oojacobo_> rgr, allowing the user to put flash on your system sounds like a pretty nice security risk to me
[18:04:03] <oojacobo_> but I'm sure you know all about that already
[18:04:04] <ThrushAAX> Lanuyba`: does it open behind that one? does the attributes in the html viewer of your console change?
[18:05:19] <Lanuyba`> ThrushAAX no it doesnt open behind the first one. i checked firebug and nothing happens if i press the button to open the second dialog
[18:05:51] <Lanuyba`> if i would switch the two dialogues the *second* one would open but the *first* one not
[18:06:18] <ThrushAAX> and you put a log in the click handler to make sure they are being fired?
[18:07:25] <ThrushAAX> er, in that first file, all of that js is in a document ready block right?
[18:07:32] <Lanuyba`> no how can i do that?
[18:07:45] <ThrushAAX> $(function(){ that thing
[18:07:55] <ThrushAAX> you have it in the second file, so it binds the dialog and events
[18:08:00] <ThrushAAX> but not in the first file?
[18:08:00] <Lanuyba`> yep
[18:08:09] <Lanuyba`> but not in a on document ready
[18:08:40] <ThrushAAX> sorry, doing $(function(){}) is the same as a document ready
[18:08:43] <Lanuyba`> i have the "$(function(){" in both files but i just shortened it
[18:08:48] <ThrushAAX> ok
[18:08:49] <Lanuyba`> ah okay
[18:08:54] <Lanuyba`> hmm :/
[18:09:39] <ThrushAAX> and both dialog div's are getting the base classes in firebug?
[18:10:39] <ThrushAAX> oh wait
[18:10:42] <Lanuyba`> how can i check that?
[18:11:07] <ThrushAAX> are you loading the button that is being clicked to open the second dialog through ajax?
[18:11:15] <Lanuyba`> yup
[18:11:26] <ThrushAAX> use .on instead of .click then
[18:11:48] <ThrushAAX> you need to bind the .click after it is has been loaded
[18:11:51] <ThrushAAX> you can't do it before
[18:11:58] <ThrushAAX> but .on can
[18:12:38] <Lanuyba`> ill check that...
[18:13:19] <rgr> ThrushAAX: thanks for the pointers. Done with jquery here - http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/change-wmode-with-jquery/
[18:13:26] <rgr> works great.
[18:13:38] <Lanuyba`> ThrushAAX it seems like there is no difference
[18:14:05] <ThrushAAX> Lanuyba`: well, you can't jsut replace it, it works a bit different
[18:14:17] <Lanuyba`> oh okay
[18:14:41] <ThrushAAX> $("#musicwish_l").on('click','#open-musicw_l', function(){} )
[18:14:44] <ThrushAAX> or something like that
[18:14:56] <Lanuyba`> k sec :)
[18:14:57] <Lanuyba`> thanks
[18:16:10] <Lanuyba`> still no change :(
[18:16:26] <ThrushAAX> have to do it with both click events
[18:16:26] <Lanuyba`> is the "e.preventDefault();" necessary?
[18:16:32] <Lanuyba`> okay
[18:16:41] <ThrushAAX> probably not
[18:16:54] <ThrushAAX> it depends on what you are clicking
[18:17:35] <ThrushAAX> shouldn't be necessary because you are returning false
[18:18:49] <Lanuyba`> okay here are my changes
[18:18:53] <Lanuyba`> 	$("#open-musicw_l").on("click", function () {
[18:18:58] <Lanuyba`> $('.open-loeschen').on("click", function(){
[18:19:02] <Lanuyba`> but no effect
[18:19:07] <ThrushAAX> nope, not how .on works
[18:19:08] <ThrushAAX> ?on
[18:19:09] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:19:09] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised â€œon()â€.
[18:19:11] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised â€œon()â€." in jQuery Docs.
[18:24:00] <Lanuyba`> okay be patient...i need a while to understand this :D
[18:24:36] <ThrushAAX> yeah, its a little weird
[18:24:44] <ThrushAAX> the basic idea is you bind it to a parent element
[18:25:06] <ThrushAAX> then the second paramater is what you want to actually fire the event
[18:25:11] <Lanuyba`> i need this for both dialogues?
[18:25:58] <ThrushAAX> well, the current thing is to use it for pretty much all events
[18:26:08] <hanitavssol> yoooooooooooooohooooooooooo
[18:26:19] <ThrushAAX> you need it for any time you add content to the html
[18:26:19] <hanitavssol> only jquuuuuuuuuuuery!!!
[18:26:39] <hanitavssol> help help some body help
[18:27:05] <ThrushAAX> if you put a console.log($(".open-loeschen")) before your current click events, you would see an empty array
[18:27:12] <ThrushAAX> as the item doesn't exist yet
[18:27:12] <razzi> hanitavssol with what?
[18:27:27] <Lanuyba`> okay
[18:27:40] <Lanuyba`> ill try to change it ^^
[18:27:54] <hanitavssol> i going to creat a gallery
[18:28:09] <hanitavssol> but i dont know
[18:28:37] <hanitavssol> how can create with jquery and connect to DB
[18:29:07] <Lanuyba`> ThrushAAX but i dont get it: I have for one dialog two commands...one for the click which will start the second one and one for the dialog itself
[18:29:50] <Lanuyba`> if i say now, that the first command $('.open-loeschen').on("click", function(){} ... what should i change in the second one to fire the event?
[18:30:13] <ThrushAAX> .on takes three paramaters
[18:31:45] <ThrushAAX> I believe it should be $("#musicwish_l").on('click', '.open-loeschen', function(){} ) in dialog_loeschen
[18:32:19] <Lanuyba`> but then its only one "command" for each dialog right?
[18:32:59] <Lanuyba`> aaah
[18:33:06] <Lanuyba`> waiiiit a second :D
[18:35:53] <Lanuyba`> wow it works! :D
[18:35:58] <Lanuyba`> thanks you very much
[18:36:12] <ThrushAAX> yay
[18:36:56] <Lanuyba`> okay but it doesnt work completely ^^
[18:37:22] <Lanuyba`> now the button reacts but it doesnt open a new dialog...it just writes it below the ajax event
[18:38:54] <Lanuyba`> okay i just pasted the <div> container in the index.php :)
[18:38:58] <Lanuyba`> it works
[18:39:17] <ThrushAAX> also, um, IIRC, if that update() is being loaded by ajax it won't work  I think
[18:40:05] <Lanuyba`> huh? it works..but it refreshes all 10 seconds
[18:40:10] <ThrushAAX> oh, ok
[18:40:18] <ThrushAAX> I didn't remember correctly then
[18:40:38] <Lanuyba`> it would be better if it refreshes additionally after the deletecommand..
[18:40:42] <Lanuyba`> no idea howto
[18:44:24] <Parhs> hello guys.. is this correct for launching colorbox gallery with jquery ?
[18:44:31] <Parhs>  $("#gal-launch").click(function () {

[20:40:09] <tocka> i used it like a couple of months back for my uni project
[20:40:13] <tocka> its pretty easy to use
[20:40:19] <haizum_> ya
[20:40:27] <tocka> glad you like it
[20:40:29] <haizum_> i just had a project where that would have come in handy. used isotope instead
[20:40:36] <haizum_> it has a cool filter effect that i like
[20:41:04] <tocka> uuu
[20:41:07] <tocka> looks cool

[20:47:56] <zapsoda> ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout      How do i get the stupid loading screen  to come up before it shows the page at all?
[20:50:22] <jqueryTest> http://www.iv.com.cn  This is my project
[20:52:54] <zapsoda> Can anyone please tell me how to fix this
[20:56:47] <sparuvu> how to fix what ?
[20:57:34] <oojacoboo> how can I set a timeout onBlur
[20:58:18] <oojacoboo> .blur().delay()  or something?
[20:58:46] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Read the bolded block here: http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[20:59:01] <oojacoboo> nice
[20:59:19] <oojacoboo> so, I have an issue where I have a blur event that removes a button but when you click the button there needs to be an action
[20:59:32] <oojacoboo> so, when clicking it triggers blur which prevents the button click
[21:01:04] <oojacoboo> can I doâ€¦ if($("#foo").click()) {} ?
[21:02:05] <zapsoda> ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout      How do i get the stupid loading screen  to come up before it shows the page at all?   sparuvu
[21:02:10] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: What do you think?
[21:02:23] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin, yes, b/c it works
[21:02:47] <haizum_> then why ask? lol
[21:03:05] <oojacoboo> b/c I asked before I
[21:03:09] <oojacoboo> ?tias
[21:03:09] <bot-t> Try It And See
[21:03:40] <sparuvu> zapsoda: looks like
[21:03:46] <sparuvu> all your stuff is static
[21:03:49] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Then why are you asking here?
[21:03:57] <zapsoda> Yha?
[21:03:58] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin, keep you busy
[21:04:02] <haizum_> lol
[21:04:03] <sparuvu> and you are loading the plugin on document. ready
[21:04:10] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: My day job already does that for me
[21:04:11] <zapsoda> Yep?
[21:04:19] <zapsoda> What should i do it on?
[21:04:29] <sparuvu> if you wantâ€¦ hide the static contentâ€¦ initially
[21:04:42] <sparuvu> then load your loader and on callback
[21:04:47] <sparuvu> fadeIn your content
[21:05:03] <sparuvu> though this sounds stupid
[21:05:13] <haizum_> ok i can't get infinite scroll to work for the life of me... here's my code:
[21:05:14] <haizum_> http://jsfiddle.net/TCh9n/1/
[21:05:19] <sparuvu> usually â€¦ you put loader for dynamic content
[21:05:21] <haizum_> here's my site: http://www.ibuho.com.ar/ejemplo.php
[21:05:25] <haizum_> anyone who can figure it out gets a cookie :)
[21:05:36] <oojacoboo> haizum_, I could look up our code for it
[21:05:45] <oojacoboo> basically just checking on the position of the scrollbar IIRC
[21:05:54] <haizum_> documentation here: http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[21:05:57] <oojacoboo> or an element in the DOM to come into view
[21:05:57] <haizum_> followed to a key.
[21:05:59] <oojacoboo> I forget
[21:06:11] <oojacoboo> ohâ€¦ there is a site dedicated to itâ€¦. wow...
[21:06:22] <oojacoboo> peeps can't just dev?
[21:06:38] <oojacoboo> and it's a wordpress plugin lmfao
[21:07:01] <oojacoboo> I need a wordpress plugin that does my taxes for me
[21:08:33] <tw2113> except that page lists a non-wp version as well
[21:08:35] <jqueryTest> Infinite scroll you first calculate the browser main body height, and then determine the height of the scroll bar~~~~~
[21:08:56] <jqueryTest> This is my usual train of thought
[21:09:10] <Ayush> oojacoboo #wordpress
[21:09:20] <oojacoboo> Ayush, thanks man
[21:10:51] <jqueryTest> Who is using PHP???
[21:11:31] <haizum_> im not using the infinite scroll wordpress plugin
[21:11:34] <haizum_> im using the jquery plugin
[21:11:57] <Eviltwin> jqueryTest: I heard the people in ##php do
[21:12:37] <jqueryTest> Eviltwin  OK~ï¼
[21:13:50] <jqueryTest> bey~! guys
[21:14:07] <fitsum> @jqueryTest yo
[21:15:28] <oojacoboo> butblack, make up your mind yo
[21:15:52] <butblack> oojacoboo: sorry lol, i was having a convo in another channel..
[21:29:19] <mfoxdogg|work> anyone know how to escape a string, as im posting a string with \n's  in it and the .ajax call is getting upset
[21:55:45] <devslash> hey is anyone here ?
[22:18:16] <p3rsist> Hi guys. Is there a way to combine sortable and selectable so I can sort multiple selected items?
[22:19:20] <prs> Hi.
[22:28:02] <granden> If I want one part of my front-page to update dynamiclly. With new scores as they are updated in the database. How would I do that? a setInterval(function(){ //Ajax call here },1000); or is there any way?
[22:30:36] <Eviltwin> I would avoid setInterval and instead do something like function update() { $.ajax({..., success: function(data) { ...; update(); }}); } update();
[22:30:47] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you could get requests stacking up
[22:31:11] <granden> oh ok.
[22:31:26] <granden> So basiclly what you do is
[22:31:29] <Eviltwin> Or rather function update() { $.ajax({..., success: function(data) { ...; setTimeout(update, 1000); }}); } update();
[22:31:42] <p3rsist> so no one has an idea on how to have multiple selected items sortable?
[22:31:59] <granden> you create a function called update, and that calls itself and then I call it when I want it to start auto update?
[22:32:26] <Eviltwin> Effectively, yes
[22:33:02] <granden> newer done any ajax before, so this might sound pretty stupid. But in my PHP file should I use return or echo?
[22:33:12] <granden> to have a response sent to the function update.
[22:33:13] <Eviltwin> echo
[22:33:41] <granden> Ok, cool.
[22:34:47] <granden> Eviltwin: Those ... after the function(data){.... there.
[22:35:08] <granden> Is there where I put my code for handling the ajax return?
[22:35:09] <Eviltwin> That's the part where you use that data to update the page
[22:35:16] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:35:19] <granden> Great
[22:35:46] <granden> And I can use jquery freely there, no restrictions?
[22:35:50] <Eviltwin> Yup
[22:36:05] <tw2113> anyone have any idea why this error would start showing up with no line number or anything? "Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'"
[22:36:11] <tw2113> in console
[22:36:22] <granden> Eviltwin: Great thanks a lot, now I just have to figure out how to make the ajax call.
[22:36:38] <Eviltwin> tw2113: I'd set the console to break on uncaught exceptions and see what's causing it
[22:38:42] <tw2113> my dumb moment: how do i do that
[22:39:22] <Eviltwin> It's explained here for Chrome: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints
[22:39:24] <tw2113> nevermind, i think i got it
[22:39:48] <tw2113> i checked one of the "show?" on the console tab
[22:39:49] <granden> Eviltwin: Hmm, when reading about ajax calls on the jquery webpage they use .done(funciton(html){ and no success.
[22:39:52] <granden> Is there any difference?
[22:40:21] <Eviltwin> Just a different way of writing the same thing
[22:40:25] <granden> ok
[22:40:36] <Eviltwin> Might be clearer because then there's less clutter in that $.ajax({...}) object
[22:40:41] <Eviltwin> Up to you
[22:41:04] <granden> I think I prefer the other way, the way you showed, just got confused.
[22:41:25] <nofxx> anyone using ko, angular new databinding fads? Experimenting in a new project and having hell of a bad time.
[22:42:49] <tw2113> ugh <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:45:32] <tw2113> *facepalm*
[22:45:48] <tw2113> 2 copies of jquery enqueued, and 2 copies of jquery cycle enqueued
[22:47:53] <coldhead> redundancy: best practice
[22:48:24] <granden> Eviltwin: Something like this? http://pastebin.com/zSUvC0cU would it work? My friends server, where I got my webserver, is down. So can't try but in theory does it look correct?
[22:49:30] <granden> Woops, fixed a few misstakes in this one, http://pastebin.com/ntE3McLw
[22:50:19] <Eviltwin> Yeah, theoretically
[22:50:35] <granden> perhaps update, should be update(), in the setTimeout function
[22:52:41] <granden> Eviltwin: Thanks a lot for the help.
[22:57:22] <shellokx> hi
[22:58:12] <shellokx> i use the jquery modal dialog and want to center it on the screen, not the site
[22:58:19] <shellokx> whats the best way to do so?
[22:58:56] <coldhead> make the site the exact same size as the screen
[22:58:59] <coldhead> center on both
[22:59:06] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:59:07] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:59:12] <shellokx> $("#about").dialog({   minWidth: 700, minHeigth: 700, modal: true,  position: "center"    });
[22:59:54] <shellokx> coldhead: no, there are a lot of data, so i have to scroll on the page ;)
[23:00:33] <coldhead> oh that sounds hard :(
[23:04:24] <shellokx> coldhead: got it :)
[23:04:28] <shellokx> stackoverflow ;)
[23:04:37] <shellokx> open: function(event, ui) {     $(this).parent().css('position', 'fixed'); }
[23:05:05] <prs> shellokx: isn't it like a default behaviour?
[23:05:48] <prs> i belive that every window that I was working with in past two weeks, was centered on the screen.
[23:06:09] <shellokx> prs: nop
[23:07:26] <ejcweb> I'm looking for a lightweight jQuery plugin which emulated the behaviour of the Facebook compose message 'To' field, where once you have entered a name, it will put it in a blue box, and let you type more. I don't care about the auto-complete name functionality.
[23:07:56] <ejcweb> Does anything like this exist? If not I don't think it would be too tricky to make.
[23:08:17] <dormancy_> hi , how jquery achieve cors in ie6 or ie7
[23:21:33] <adlwalrus> dormancy_: very interesting question.
[23:21:36] <adlwalrus> maybe flash?
[23:28:02] <dormancy_> flash
[23:28:05] <dormancy_> ?
[23:28:31] <Eviltwin> It's that thing Adobe owns now
[23:28:49] <dormancy_> but I think is not
[23:29:03] <Eviltwin> IE6 and IE7 don't support CORS, sorry
[23:29:10] <Eviltwin> They're ancient browsers
[23:30:41] <nprice> Quick question - how do i do this:  http://pastebin.com/YewaDkCq  (just add a .change trigger to each input with a rel attribute)
[23:31:10] <dormancy_> I know ,but in ie6 ,jquery can achieve cors through "jquery.support.cors=true"
[23:32:31] <dormancy_> so , i want how it achieve
[23:34:20] <faraway> nprice: whats wrong with this code? excpet that it could be written that way: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/cPptk/
[23:40:05] <nprice> faraway: it just doesn't seem to be firing
[23:40:27] <faraway> nprice: change event fire on blur
[23:40:51] <faraway> nprice: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/cPptk/1/
[23:41:32] <faraway> nprice: with an additinal keypress it will be a live feedback
[23:41:54] <bigLanky> http://screencast.com/t/8ex9pkLkqRVD <--- anyone know a slider that can do this?
[23:42:20] <nprice> faraway: strange
[23:42:27] <faraway> nprice: what is strange ?
[23:42:31] <Atty> well if its not firing you just might be out of ammo or its jammed..
[23:42:35] <nprice> i put it into document.ready and now it works :P
[23:42:38] <nprice> all it was
[23:42:54] <Atty> If its raspberry jam then it was lonestar..
[23:43:06] <faraway> nprice: well that is not strange â€¦ a selector only sees what it in the document at the time you query
[23:43:15] <nprice> true but it was in the footer
[23:43:27] <nprice> bigLanky: i think flexslider can
[23:45:42] <faraway> nprice: either this or a syntax error. but useing the dom ready event is alway a good idea
[23:45:58] <bigLanky> not seeing a slider handle anywhere on flexslider
[23:49:16] <nprice> faraway: i'll remember that for the future
