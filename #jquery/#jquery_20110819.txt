[00:01:46] <fireh> sevenpluseight, there is #codeigniter or ##php
[00:02:20] <sevenpluseight> fireh, danheberden and I are on the verge of a breakthrough, but this is simply jQuery anyway
[00:02:28] <sevenpluseight> nothing to do with CI
[00:02:56] <danheberden> sevenpluseight you could use CI though - just add the active class when you render the view
[00:04:00] <sevenpluseight> something like this?

[00:16:47] <SIDU> $('#ftpmm').click(function(){$('#ftpmm2').toggle()});
[00:16:59] <xec> good morning #jQuery!
[00:17:02] <SIDU> howto rewrite above to tidy code ?
[00:17:38] <xec> $('#ftpmm, #ftp, #ftpm').click(function(){$(this).toggle()});
[00:17:55] <xec> something like that?
[00:18:01] <coldhead> you are ignoring the "2"s, xec
[00:18:10] <xec> right
[00:18:16] <SIDU> coldhead: :)
[00:18:25] <xec> $('#ftpmm, #ftp, #ftpm').click(function(){$(this.id + "2").toggle()});
[00:18:27] <xec> ? :D
[00:18:36] <SIDU> coldhead: ah. that's right
[00:18:48] <SIDU> this.id ?
[00:19:05] <SIDU> will this.id works ?
[00:19:11] <coldhead> should do!
[00:19:16] <SIDU> ok let me test
[00:19:19] <xec> should return the id of what youre clicking, yes, if i remember correctly
[00:19:44] <SIDU> coldhead: i was usiing: $(this).attr('id')
[00:20:24] <xec> yeah, thats the jquerified way, this.id is native javascript
[00:20:48] <newhere> hi, my form on submit is not triggering jquery:$('form[frmList]').submit(function() {
[00:21:19] <newhere> also tried: $('#frmList').submit(function() {
[00:21:46] <xec> what is frmList?
[00:21:54] <newhere> the ID of my form
[00:22:28] <xec> then the latter should work, the former is trying to find an attribute named frmList
[00:22:36] <SIDU> xec not working
[00:22:46] <xec> SIDU: what happens
[00:22:48] <newhere> both r not working
[00:22:58] <Cros79> what's the prefered way to call .data()? .data('list-id') or .data('listId') ?
[00:23:05] <SIDU> $(this.id + "2").toggle() not working
[00:23:29] <xec> SIDU: if you call console.log(this.id)
[00:23:34] <xec> ahh nevermind
[00:23:41] <xec> $('#ftpmm, #ftp, #ftpm').click(function(){$("#" + this.id + "2").toggle()});
[00:23:45] <xec> forgot the #
[00:24:03] <xec> early bird gets the bugs
[00:25:02] <xec> newhere: are you including your script at end of page (or at least after the form) or wrapped it in a document ready?
[00:25:04] <danheberden> wtf
[00:25:09] <SIDU> xec: wow - that's smartly working :|
[00:25:24] <newhere> prior the form
[00:25:24] <danheberden> why in the hell would you do $( '#' + this.id
[00:25:31] <danheberden> crazzzzzy shit
[00:25:35] <danheberden> CRAAAAAZY
[00:25:43] <newhere> does it need to be after the form?
[00:25:51] <xec> ok sorry, what would you do danheberden
[00:25:57] <newhere> ill try
[00:26:00] <PERECil> does someone knows a good tool to check for javascript memory leaks? I tried drip, but it reports lots of memory leaks...
[00:26:08] <danheberden> xec, i'd have more manageable markup
[00:26:15] <danheberden> but don't mind me, it's the rum talking
[00:26:50] <SIDU> xec: howto rewrite this to jq: parent.document.body.cols='0,*';
[00:27:05] <SIDU> xec: glad jq understands js
[00:27:20] <danheberden> SIDU hate to break it to you, but jq IS js
[00:27:30] <danheberden> it's just a function
[00:27:34] <danheberden> $ - that's all it us
[00:27:36] <danheberden> *it is
[00:27:39] <danheberden> a glorified function
[00:27:43] <SIDU> danheberden: really wow .
[00:28:04] <danheberden> a bad-ass well made function, mind you
[00:28:37] <newhere> no success
[00:29:19] <newhere> ok
[00:29:20] <newhere> $('#frmList').submit(function() {
[00:29:22] <newhere> works
[00:29:25] <newhere> after the form
[00:29:25] <SIDU> danheberden: i made this in js: var $=function(id){return document.getElementById(id);} also works
[00:29:29] <newhere> thx
[00:29:41] <danheberden> aye
[00:29:47] <FiSHNUGGET> Is there a way I can use .change() on a text input w/o having to wait for the user to naviagte away from the input field?
[00:30:11] <danheberden> SIDU though the best qsa wrapper ever is https://github.com/danheberden/Quewery
[00:30:15] <SIDU> howto rewrite this in jq: parent.menu.window.location='menu.php'
[00:30:17] <danheberden> 4 serious
[00:30:24] <danheberden> SIDU why?
[00:30:28] <danheberden> you already have it in js
[00:30:33] <SIDU> ah. ok
[00:30:37] <blackspotwiggins> SIDU, are you high or wat?
[00:30:44] <danheberden> MOAR HIGH
[00:30:47] <SIDU> i thought jq is shorter danheberden
[00:30:55] <danheberden> SIDU meh, if it helps it helps
[00:31:19] <SIDU> glad again jq can mixed with js
[00:31:39] <danheberden> yes, just like steel can mix with metal
[00:31:47] <blackspotwiggins> i think he's just trolling
[00:31:58] <danheberden> with one of those little trolling motors?

[00:40:01] <coldhead> oh no
[01:02:39] <amit_usual> does somebody know of a code example of loading a remote rest resource and showing it using xslt and jquery
[01:05:22] <courpse> $('.avatar').hover(function() { alert(this); }); Anyone know why this does nothing when hoving over a span with class of avatar?

[01:22:00] <Woet> does anyone know why the slide effect at https://www.snelserver.com/?sennehosadamsinyav starts half way? - http://i.imgur.com/TpGGo.png
[01:22:45] <Aamir> Nooooo http://nooooooooooooooo.com
[01:25:45] <alabd1> Good day all , while New account is pressed nothing happens , http://pastebin.com/nKnQ8FjY
[01:37:03] <xec> Woet: it's got a float: left;
[01:37:15] <Woet> xec: else it will go to a newline instead of next to 'discount'
[01:37:40] <xec> sure you do, the discount is floated too
[01:37:53] <xec> float only the discount, not the sliding text box
[01:37:56] <Woet> okay
[01:38:29] <Woet> xec: see what happens now
[01:39:10] <xec> Woet: you have a margin-right: 20px; on #banner
[01:39:15] <xec> why
[01:39:49] <Woet> xec: to make it align with the social media buttons at the right top
[01:40:05] <Woet> xec: removed it though - same problem
[01:40:40] <xec> ok, what is the same problem
[01:40:48] <Woet> xec: that it goes to a newline during the effect
[01:41:00] <Woet> xec: just refresh the page and you'll see
[01:41:05] <xec> what browser?
[01:41:13] <Woet> xec: oh, i see it doesn't happen on firefox 4
[01:41:21] <Woet> it happens on latest chrome and safari
[01:41:29] <exitdescription> Woet: the sidebar floats above some elements as well
[01:41:38] <Woet> exitdescription: how do you mean?
[01:42:01] <xec> haha nice
[01:42:20] <Woet> xec: i don't think webkit is to blame though, probably silly css
[01:42:21] <Woet> but i can't find it
[01:42:34] <Woet> xec: that problem doesn't happen with float: left; though
[01:42:46] <exitdescription> if i go to the snelserver.com page, and scroll up or down, some background elements are above the sidebar
[01:43:10] <Woet> exitdescription: which browser?
[01:43:27] <exitdescription> i'm on chrome
[01:43:43] <Woet> exitdescription: weird, i'm on chrome too and i've thoroughly tested it with 800 x 600 reso and above
[01:43:48] <Woet> not happening to me
[01:43:49] <xec> yeah the border of the red bar for instance
[01:43:52] <sasori> hi everyone, any idea why the line 57  of this code of mine pops up twice? like when i submit the form,it pops,then when i already click "ok", it still there, after clicking the 2nd alert,that's the only time it disappers
[01:43:55] <sasori> http://pastebin.com/bKUi6aKW
[01:44:15] <Woet> xec / exitdescription: oh, i see it
[01:44:25] <exitdescription> woet: just try resizing your chrome chrome.
[01:44:31] <xec> lol
[01:44:35] <Woet> exitdescription: yea, i did, i see what you mean
[01:44:42] <exitdescription> :)
[01:45:10] <Woet> fixed that
[01:45:13] <Woet> banner still annoying me though
[01:45:22] <xec> could you reproduce just the banner and animation in jsfiddle.net
[01:45:52] <Woet> xec: i don't think it's a jquery bug, it's related to my css
[01:46:08] <exitdescription> just out of curiousity, is it a general trend to have really big buttons and fonts ?
[01:46:16] <Woet> xec: putting it on jsfiddle probably solves the issue - i'll try
[01:46:29] <anli_> exitdescription: seems like that, check google+
[01:46:34] <Woet> exitdescription: yes, it is lately
[01:46:43] <anli_> Or twitter etc
[01:46:51] <Woet> exitdescription: see http://mailchimp.com/ and https://mailchimp.com/signup/ for example
[01:47:02] <xec> exitdescription: yeah, seems inevitable, people getting higher and higher resolutions, and smaller and smaller displays
[01:47:02] <exitdescription> yeah maybe it translates better to a mobile device
[01:48:00] <exitdescription> woet: i like your colour scheme
[01:48:45] <Woet> exitdescription: i'm not a designer, but thanks i guess
[01:50:18] <Woet> xec / exitdescription: http://jsfiddle.net/GMTg8/
[01:50:20] <Woet> happens there too
[01:50:34] <Woet> but probably makes it easier to debug
[01:51:01] <xec> it resizes window?
[01:51:16] <xec> on firefox
[01:51:22] <xec> no nevermind
[01:51:28] <xec> mouse acting up lol
[01:53:27] <silv3r_m00n> why does this issue occur >> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5470843/jquery-live-return-false-issue
[01:53:30] <xec> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/GMTg8/1/
[01:53:33] <silv3r_m00n> the api says that return false should work
[01:53:47] <Woet> xec: awesome - what did you change?
[01:54:06] <xec> Woet: put overflow: hidden; on #banner_content
[01:54:16] <Woet> xec: awesome
[01:55:07] <exitdescription> ah ok overflow hidden would align the banner content
[01:55:08] <siovene> Hi.
[01:55:37] <siovene> Why does .css("width") always returns 0px for items I have just created (and put some text inside)?
[01:56:18] <mmokrysz> sioevene Have you added it to the DOM?
[01:56:26] <kalvin> hello
[01:56:33] <siovene> mmokrysz: its not visible yet.
[01:56:41] <Woet> xec: a minor issue on your revision at http://jsfiddle.net/GMTg8/1/
[01:56:43] <siovene> So I guess not.
[01:56:48] <Woet> xec: near the end of the effect, it shoots to the left
[01:56:52] <Woet> instead of fluent
[01:57:03] <siovene> kalvin: but the CSS width should be a static property, shouldn't it?
[01:57:36] <kalvin> yes it should be
[01:57:51] <siovene> kalvin: the problem is probably that the creation of this object happens when the user clicks something.
[01:58:26] <siovene> so, I am adding this object I just created to some parent, but debugging, the thing is not really drawn on the screen until my *after* my function exits.
[01:59:06] <exitdescription> this could be a little sacrilegeous, but is there a free adobe flash compiler ?
[02:00:15] <xec> Woet: remove margin-left on #banner_content - try padding instead
[02:00:44] <Woet> xec: ah, i tried that already
[02:00:50] <Woet> xec: but margin-left was two times in the css, fixed too
[02:00:53] <Woet> xec: thanks a lot
[02:02:44] <chjj> exitdescription: im pretty sure flash is "sacreligious" anyway
[02:03:03] <exitdescription> oh yeah .... but i love timeline based programming snippets  ...
[02:03:26] <exitdescription> there should be a javascript based ide with this paradigm
[02:05:31] <mndar> I am using the layout plugin from http://layout.jquery-dev.net   is there a way to get rid of the resize bars ?
[02:14:11] <mndar> or even a way to adjust its thickness ?
[02:21:36] <Narhir> hmm can I write code like this one:
[02:21:36] <Narhir> div.is(":hidden");
[02:22:12] <dr0id> $('div').attr('hidden') === true
[02:22:28] <dr0id> wait, no
[02:22:29] <dr0id> lol
[02:22:38] <dr0id> use .css
[02:22:40] <Narhir> hmm well It is connected to class .showmore
[02:26:01] <SugaSlide> lol http://i.imgur.com/wXGub.jpg
[02:26:38] <dr0id> lol
[02:29:38] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/9R5zm/

[02:41:11] <boghog> does anyone know of common ways in which the fadeIn/fadeOut effect can break in IE9? on a site I am working on I am using those to transition between two <p>s of text, and it works great in most browsers except IE9 (and presumably lower, but I suppose those don't support opacity anyhow). In IE9, the text that is being faded in or out is shown/hidden right away without a gradual transition of its opagueness. I tried to create a little test
[02:41:11] <boghog> -case but those all seem to work fine in IE9
[02:44:27] <Narhir> k found solution
[02:52:28] <PeeterWork> courpse
[02:52:39] <PeeterWork> look at live or delegate methods
[02:56:47] <courpse> PeeterWork, Not much of a difference, :/
[02:56:54] <courpse> The event is just not fireing.
[02:57:51] <PeeterWork> Replicate it at jsfiddle.net
[02:58:41] <Narad> hi
[03:02:27] <Narad> please someone help, I got an interesting "bug", I'm not sure whats wrong with that, so here is the code: http://pastebin.com/ZAC94y8J
[03:02:45] <Narad> add section is working properly, but by the update part I have an issue...
[03:03:39] <Narad> when I want to select the Y var, I mean when I do $("#" + data[i].key) then it says unhandled expression 30 syntax error...
[03:03:51] <Narad> but it works with for example .resource
[03:04:14] <Narad> I just can't understand whats wrong with that... any ideas please?
[03:04:18] <ravenzz> console.debug(data[i])
[03:04:18] <ravenzz> ?
[03:06:04] <Narad> ravenzz: well.... I see an object with the items I want
[03:06:17] <Narad> Object { changePercent="<span style="color:red">-19,37%</span>", key="index:30:1843", operation="update", több...}  etc..
[03:06:39] <ravenzz> ok
[03:07:33] <ravenzz> $("#index:30:1843") is clearly unacceptable
[03:07:48] <Narad> why?
[03:07:54] <Narad> : ?
[03:08:01] <ravenzz> do you have an element with that ID?
[03:08:28] <Narad> yes... its built by the add section, first part of the code
[03:08:43] <Narad> forthe first run we got a complete json thing with add operation
[03:08:47] <Narad> and code is built
[03:09:03] <Narad> then for other refreshes it sends only those which were updated
[03:09:07] <Narad> with update operation
[03:09:14] <courpse> PeeterWork, Got it, :D
[03:09:16] <courpse> Thanks m8.
[03:11:09] <Songo> how can i achieve this : find("tr:slice(1,20), tr:slice(22,35)")
[03:14:17] <m8> courpse, np :)
[03:15:06] <Narad> ravenzz: no idea? :$
[03:15:33] <xtrci> hi guys, anyone give me help here? when i have two forms i can get the right attributes clicking in the submit button with jquery, but i can't get the right input's :( i'm only getting the first one
[03:15:42] <xtrci> here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/kzWWH/11/
[03:15:47] <ravenzz> mmm dunno, do you have a live example? as i can debug it?
[03:17:55] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/ECdqR/9/  <-- my table rows sortable.... like tree behaviour.... now what I'd like to achive is that dragging rows is confined within their scope... in my case... if I am dragging row 2.2 it should be allowed only between rows 2 and 3 ...hope you get the logic
[03:24:55] <nail_> xtrci: val() returns value of the first element, and you select by classname, so target that to the relevant form.. eg. $(this).find('.id_inviter').val() (besides, I'm not sure what you expect with $(this).attr("value"), and there's no element with an id_event class)
[03:25:55] <xtrci> ah that was a mistake <:
[03:25:58] <xtrci> thx nail_  gonna try
[03:27:23] <amit_usual> xtrci look at your classnames
[03:27:37] <nail_> Narad: that's what ravenzz said, you can't use ':' in ids, it's not valid and it's used by jquery for expession selectors
[03:28:03] <amit_usual> xtrci : ur function runs for only one submit
[03:28:04] <xtrci> yes they are the same, because i wanted to have that function to all forms
[03:28:37] <xtrci> i don't know if this is the right way anyway, just started jjquery yesterday x)
[03:29:13] <amit_usual> xtrci : one of them is named formsubmit and the other is formsubmitss
[03:29:44] <amit_usual> xtrci :and your function will run only when formsubmitss is run
[03:29:58] <nail_> no, that's class names
[03:30:00] <xtrci> class form is form-submitss
[03:30:09] <xtrci> form class
[03:30:10] <xtrci> i mean
[03:30:23] <nail_> xtrci: see http://jsfiddle.net/kzWWH/14/
[03:31:03] <xtrci> thanks nail_ :D
[03:41:20] <CKIDOW> hi
[03:41:55] <CKIDOW> $("body").delegate("form#my-id", "submit", function(e){e.preventDefault();}); - can it be that live and delegate doesn't trigger the form submit event?
[03:42:10] <CKIDOW> for future elements
[03:42:12] <CKIDOW> ?
[03:48:46] <nail_> CKIDOW: what do you mean by "trigger" ? delegate/live is to handle events, they won't trigger anything
[04:05:52] <Link-> a click event is triggered when a button is clicked, how can I prevent the execution of the event's payload before the previous queue is cleared?
[04:10:01] <Link-> nvm
[04:10:03] <Link-> fixed
[04:11:16] <Narad> how can I write an infinite loop which calls a function in every 10sec?
[04:11:33] <Narad> setInterval("myfunc()",10000); freezes my FF
[04:11:52] <boghog> I would think setInterval would do it
[04:12:03] <boghog> does you myfunc happen to have some debugging alert()s in it?
[04:12:47] <Narad> I put one, sec.
[04:12:53] <boghog> as there's some bug with FF that can make it freeze when doing alerts at inopportune times that I've ran into a couple of times
[04:16:17] <Narad> boghog: I've now put it in, but with/without that It freezes... :/
[04:16:55] <Narad> is that a problem that the myfunc I'm invoking is doing an async json req?
[04:17:35] <boghog> does firefox just become completely unresponsive when it freezes?
[04:18:14] <Narad> yep, I have to kill-restart it
[04:18:31] <Narad> but I tried with chrome, it dont crash, but says that cant show the page
[04:18:42] <Narad> with some "x" eyed guy figure :D
[04:18:53] <Jakey> FIREFOX ROCKS!!
[04:19:01] <boghog> strange
[04:19:15] <Narad> yep... :/
[04:19:27] <Narad> if you wish I can show you the complete code
[04:19:28] <boghog> can't really say anything useful without seeing your code, but I'm really too busy to be looking at someone else's code right now :P
[04:19:36] <Narad> ah, ok :)
[04:19:52] <Narad> good work anyways, I play with it, and say if new thing is up
[04:21:35] <htlia> hi, I have a question about a selector... if I use input[class*=noValidar] I will get all input elements with class containing "noValidar"... but if I want to get the elements that DOESN'T contain this string?
[04:21:47] <boghog> and in reply to my own earlier question about fadeIn/fadeOut not working in IE9, this turns out to be because the opacity wasn't applied to absolutely positioned child elements inside the element that I was calling fadeIn/Out on, fixed it by calling fadeIn/Out on thise child elements directly
[04:22:36] <Joancreus_> i seem to have a problem with slidedown/up. when i click over the elements fast, the animations stops. when i click slowly again to go back to bottom again, it just doesn't go to the button. it stops in the middle
[04:22:45] <Joancreus_> any help would be appreciated
[04:23:30] <nail_> htlia: input:not([class*=noValidar])
[04:24:37] <htlia> thank you nail_
[04:24:40] <nail_> np
[04:26:16] <Joancreus_> it seems i got it fixed, by adding .stop(true,true). thanks anyway
[04:29:16] <intellilogic> I need this to work as an inline element(like its setup), what's preventing it from firing?  http://jsfiddle.net/intellilogic/VK6dQ/34/
[04:43:00] <Dziubus> hello
[04:43:52] <nail_> intellilogic: when registering your handler inline, "this" will refer to the window
[04:44:12] <nail_> inside the function you call, that's it
[04:46:45] <nail_> so either you use onclick="JustThisRow(this)" or preferably you take that out of your html and bind using js
[04:53:27] <Dziubus> hello, i've problem, this tiny function havent work since i've added lightbox http://jsfiddle.net/9QFbC/
[04:54:25] <Dziubus> i have this error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'fadeOut' of null"
[04:54:28] <Guest77691> hi, how can i apply an animation to two jquery objects simultaneously? and how can i ensure that the callback will only be called a single time?
[05:06:59] <nail_> Guest77691: one way is to use a counter: http://jsfiddle.net/UaHJX/
[05:10:16] <xxiao> a real basic php question $tmp=$line[1]*10 worked fine, but $tmp=$line[1]/10 gave out wrong result
[05:11:00] <xxiao> $line[1]+10; $line[1]-10; $line[1]*10 all ok, but not $line[1]/10, why is that?
[05:11:24] <xxiao> i know this is a php question...hope someone here can help
[05:11:30] <Bower^> xxio this is a JS library channel, probably better to ask in #php
[05:11:47] <xxiao> Bower^: yeah i could not get into php channel somehow
[05:12:01] <tbranyen>  /join ##php
[05:12:08] <Bower^> you have registered your user name?
[05:12:13] <Bower^> with nickserv?
[05:12:46] <ravenzz> xxiao you have to register your nickname
[05:12:49] <Bower^> Some channels, such as #php and #javascript, only allow users who are identified with nickserv
[05:13:22] <xxiao> ravenzz: what do you need...i registered at freenode and xxiao is my id
[05:13:34] <xxiao> i'm on javascript, but not php for some reason
[05:13:42] <Bower^> ./nickserv register
[05:13:44] <Bower^> i think
[05:14:05] <xxiao> Bower^: just checked, php must be invited
[05:14:18] <Bower^> or /msg nickserv register
[05:14:23] <Bower^> dude I'm in there now and I wasn't invited
[05:14:28] <Bower^> you need to register with nickserv
[05:14:29] <Bower^> then login
[05:14:38] <Bower^> (or /msg nickserv identify)
[05:14:43] <xxiao> ok let me try
[05:14:52] <xxiao> thought i did it already which is why i am even ehre
[05:14:56] <xxiao> s/ehre/here
[05:15:24] <xxiao> Cannot join to channel php (You must be invited)
[05:15:52] <Bower^> you can connect to the freenode network without being registered and some channels such as this will allow you entry whereas channels like #php require you to register with nickserv and /msg nickserv identify *password* when you connect
[05:16:25] <natrixnatrix89> how do the brackets work?
[05:16:25] <natrixnatrix89> I mean in this example: $(this)[0]
[05:16:28] <natrixnatrix89> what do they do?
[05:17:27] <xxiao> Bower^: looks like i had to re-register, now i'm in php, thanks
[05:17:32] <Bower^> np
[05:17:35] <Bower^> gl solving your issue
[05:18:51] <natrixnatrix89> guys.. can someone please help me understand what do those brackets do?:
[05:19:28] <zoggy> reference the first index of the array?
[05:20:07] <natrixnatrix89> riight
[05:20:13] <natrixnatrix89> and what would that be?
[05:20:38] <Bower^> Unless he can read code he hasn't seen he can't say
[05:20:55] <natrixnatrix89> so. if I have $('#box')[0]
[05:21:10] <natrixnatrix89> then it would be the dom element box?
[05:21:22] <Bower^> I'm not sure, I've never used jquery like that
[05:21:44] <natrixnatrix89> because there's an interesting way to prevent the context menu..
[05:22:00] <natrixnatrix89> $('#box2')[0].oncontextmenuÂ =Â function(){returnÂ false;}
[05:27:57] <linsms> Hi
[05:28:26] <linsms> I've problems setting a div's html content with .load or with .html functions
[05:31:14] <linsms> the html I want to load is http://pastebin.com/KyW5aUYG
[05:31:35] <seutje> can some1 explain the this.complete === undefined in https://gist.github.com/268257 ?
[05:34:22] <Bower^> linsms, $('#divID').html('<p> lol i'm setting stuff </p>');
[05:34:44] <Bower^> you can also .empty() a div or .append() to it
[05:35:01] <xec> seutje: i'm not sure, but im gonna guess it's in there for browsers that don't set the complete property on image elements
[05:36:00] <linsms> Bower^: If I set a simple string it works
[05:36:58] <Bower^> linsms, what are you trying to set?
[05:37:02] <Bower^> sorry you code is a bit messy
[05:37:57] <xec> "a bit" is a bit of an understatement :)
[05:37:58] <linsms> it's a fieldset with 3 ul's, and some script
[05:38:56] <xec> linsms: may I suggest you move all your javascript to a separate file, your life will be easier, I promise :)
[05:39:20] <linsms> xec: I know, but it is not as simple...
[05:39:53] <xec> linsms: okay, but then at least use *one* script tag?
[05:40:14] <xec> now you have html, javascript and styles in one big soup
[05:40:19] <linsms> It's a bit more simple...
[05:40:48] <Bower^> It's a bitch to read when you personally seperate this stuff
[05:41:19] <xec> Bower^: you mean the other way around? a bitch to read if you *don't* separate? :D
[05:41:48] <Bower^> haha :D
[05:43:51] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, i guess complete === false represents a hung state?
[05:44:01] <blackspotwiggins> the case when load doesnt fire
[05:44:12] <blackspotwiggins> and === undefined for browsers that dont have it at all
[05:44:30] <linsms> Bower^: xec: I've just try it without script and it still doesn't load
[05:44:56] <FishKAA> hi, I'm having really weird behavior with jquery $.ajax() both POST and GET method when using proxy, looks like sometimes my requests got multiplied few times
[05:45:14] <xec> blackspotwiggins: i think complete === false would be when the browser has not yet downloaded the image?
[05:45:29] <FishKAA> could you plz point me direction where to dig this problem?
[05:45:39] <xec> i'm just guessing, but that would make sense to me ;)
[05:46:15] <xec> linsms: have you cleaned up your code? html one place, javascript separated?
[05:46:53] <linsms> xec:  I've delete the javascript
[05:47:31] <xec> um ok?
[05:48:41] <linsms> this is the server response now: http://pastebin.com/dSYMsd3h
[05:48:48] <linsms> sorry for the format
[05:48:58] <xec> oh, right, and what is your code?
[05:49:35] <xec> the javascript youre using to load all this
[05:53:44] <linsms> xec: http://pastebin.com/KcGc1PsY
[05:54:35] <linsms> as you can see, as the .load function is not working, I'm traying to set the div's content with .html function
[05:54:36] <xec> ok, what happens, do you get any error?
[05:54:55] <linsms> adding the "a" string
[05:55:07] <xec> yeah i see it, line 22
[05:55:08] <linsms> I'f I add the "a" string, it works
[05:55:32] <linsms> but without adding it, the div keeps void
[05:56:37] <linsms> I clear it in line 20, and I check that it's void in 21
[05:57:02] <xec> but you're using .load() so you should not need to use .html() at all
[05:57:24] <linsms> It sould, but as I say, it doesn't work
[05:58:09] <linsms> the response can't be inserted if I don't concat an string
[05:59:05] <xec> what happens if you do typeof result
[06:00:34] <xec> does it work if you don't supply any arguments other than url to .load() ?
[06:00:39] <linsms> hazme en el javascript un typeof(response)
[06:02:14] <linsms> xec, thaks a lot, but it's time to lunch. Tomorrow I'll keep investigating it, and I'll return to chat
[06:02:17] <linsms> greets
[06:04:17] <Bower^> I'm trying to query the youtube API but it doesn't accept strings with certain characters such as . and '. Is there a jQuery library method that makes appropriate changes to the string?
[06:12:07] <ravenzz> Bower^ did you try encodeURIComponent(queryString);
[06:12:07] <ravenzz> ?
[06:12:40] <Bower^> Yup, I've tried encode too. Wtf am I doing wrong? console.log(encodeURIComponent('N.W.A')) just returns N.W.A
[06:13:20] <Bower^> Shouldn't it be N%2EW%2EA
[06:13:20] <ravenzz> btw i think that in a query string dots are not relevant
[06:14:37] <Bower^> Well my site works fine but if I select an artist like N.W.A or any track with special characters in, the query fails
[06:14:54] <Bower^> and the API says it only accepts URL escaped characters
[06:15:58] <Bower^> I could write a function that does this but I really would have thought something like this would be quite common
[06:17:30] <Bower^> You're right about the . btw ravenzz, the function works if I add whitespace for example
[06:17:46] <Bower^> but it seems google regards a . as a character that needs to be encoded
[06:19:55] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/h2Nwh/
[06:20:50] <Bower^> I don't do my query like that
[06:20:52] <Bower^> Does thst work?
[06:21:27] <ravenzz> yes
[06:21:29] <ravenzz> :?
[06:21:37] <ravenzz> do your tests
[06:21:43] <ravenzz> there
[06:22:19] <ravenzz> you should finalize the query string, putting the parameters you need
[06:22:32] <ravenzz> orderby..max-results etc
[06:23:51] <Bower^> I'm so confused as to why your method works and mine doesn't
[06:24:45] <ravenzz> what's your method?
[06:26:14] <Bower^> http://pastebin.com/kxCQ4yhq - All of the tracks call youtubeAPI.getData() when clicked on
[06:26:29] <Bower^> like I said it works absolutely fine when the artist name and track contain just numbers and letters
[06:27:19] <Bower^> So I wonder why you get a response when queries containg "N.W.A" but I get nothing back
[06:27:50] <ravenzz> there is no encoded query string there
[06:28:07] <Bower^> Yeah, the tracks call it with an encoded string
[06:28:50] <Bower^> I also appreciate it doesn't handle server failures
[06:28:54] <Bower^> But I was gonna look into that in a bit
[06:29:12] <MCerFromDetroit> Yo, I'm a Jquery coder and my code is cancerous

[06:32:13] <Altreus> google shows me a few things about creating nodes with namespaces
[06:32:26] <Altreus> I just want to know whether it does or not really

[07:27:52] <lexflex> hello everybody
[07:29:18] <lexflex> i have a question: how do i get the width of the whole content (also the area that is hidden and can only reached by scrolling)? the page and the width are built up dynamically (share point)?
[07:30:01] <MCerFromDetroit> Okay, I loaded an XML document with XHR. Why would a node have a null nodeValue, but have textContent set to a string?
[07:35:48] <phlp> MCerFromDetroit: because textContent includes child nodes (such as a text node) and nodeValue only works on text nodes
[07:37:14] <Rushing> you're probably better off using jquery's text() or attr()
[07:40:42] <MCerFromDetroit> phlp: I see
[07:41:30] <MCerFromDetroit> How can I best convert a string to a boolean? The string value is "true"
[07:41:53] <Rushing> var is = str == "true"
[07:42:42] <Rushing> in XML, 1 is also a valid boolean, so you may want to do var is = str == "true" || str == "1"
[07:43:38] <lexflex> hello everybody
[07:44:02] <lexflex> how to get the width of the whole document (incl. scroll area)?

[07:47:11] <testify> Hi. Is there any way to prevent an event with a namespace from bubbling, but not the same event with a different namespace? For some reason an event handler is being bound to the root(?) event, not the specific namespaced event. Is that normal? http://jsfiddle.net/ynmZz/
[07:47:12] <lexflex> so many people connected and nobody can help a jQuery noob
[07:48:01] <kborchers> stupid bot :(  groenroos see http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[07:48:11] <groenroos> kborchers, currently I'm using $(this+":focus") but that don't seem to be working
[07:48:46] <lexflex> does nobody know how to get the width of all content when its super large and there is scrolling ?
[07:49:12] <kborchers> groenroos: try $(this).is(":focus")
[07:50:54] <kborchers> lexflex: have you tried $(document).width() or $(window).width() ?
[07:51:04] <misterm> groenroos: you can't really mix passing an object plus a string selector like that, so unless "this" is a string selector, that wouldn't work
[07:51:48] <groenroos> misterm, yeah I kinda figured that wouldn't work, but I thought it wouldn't cost anything to try
[07:56:33] <Nikro_md> hey guys, how can I disable middle-mouse click functionality?
[07:59:43] <madherchod> hello, how can i resize a text area on hover using jqeury
[08:01:00] <xrated> jQuery(textareaselector).hover(function(){ jQuery(this).css({width:foo, height:foo}) });
[08:01:34] <madherchod> is that for me ?
[08:01:43] <madherchod> sir
[08:01:55] <misterm> madherchod: yes
[08:02:04] <madherchod> is there a working demo for it ?
[08:02:09] <madherchod> or a tutorial
[08:02:19] <madherchod> or something i can read
[08:02:27] <madherchod> google is giving me stupid results
[08:02:27] <lexflex> kborchers: yes i did, both do not work but give me only the size that is also visible. i might add that some of the content streching is dynamically done (sharepoint)
[08:02:51] <xrated> madherchod: http://api.jquery.com/hover/ in tandem with http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:02:59] <misterm> madherchod: just look for "jquery tutorial" to learn the basics of jquery
[08:04:04] <groenroos> kborchers; got it working! Thanks a bunch!
[08:04:10] <kborchers> cool, np
[08:04:53] <zabka> hi, http://pastebin.com/fyRXb1SW <-- im getting re response ["ir.support@quartal.com"," "] but the autocomplete is not popping anyting.
[08:05:01] <zabka> *anything
[08:05:04] <kborchers> madherchod: here is a quick working example using hover and animate http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YeGVL/
[08:05:08] <theagiles> Hi everyone, I am in the end of finishing a component for Joomla.  And I am in desperate need of learning how to 1. call a php file that contains the data manipulation 2. Reload a HTML tag to display the updated information. Hoping someone knows of a generic script that will handle this? From what I've read jquery seems to be the way I should go, but javascript has been a struggle for me.
[08:05:58] <xrated> theagiles: jQuery.load seems to be what you want.
[08:06:00] <kborchers> madherchod: there are other things to take into consideration when using animate but just wanted to give you something to look at
[08:06:09] <xrated> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[08:06:49] <theagiles> xrated: Ok, I have very little knowledge in the jquery area.  Hoping there would almost be some sort of generic script I could use.
[08:07:33] <xrated> theagiles, jQuery.load is pretty much it, jQuery(function() { jQuery(selector).load(urlToScript); });
[08:08:25] <xrated> That'll make an ajax call to your script and replace the element's content with what ever the ajax response is.
[08:09:11] <misterm> zabka: are you sure the request is succsefull, have you tried logging the resp variable to see what it is, why are you doing  return [resp] ?
[08:09:31] <zabka> misterm: yes. it is succesful
[08:09:48] <zabka> misterm: im motitor it with firebug
[08:10:40] <zabka> misterm: i get this for example ["ir.support@quartal.com"," "]
[08:11:21] <misterm> zabka: and have you checked the actual resp variable inside the success callback?
[08:11:51] <misterm> zabka: what is it? why are you sticking it in an array? does autocomplete want an array of arrays?
[08:12:47] <zabka> misterm: yes, alert(resp) gives me :["ir.support@quartal.com","ir.support@investis.com"," "]
[08:13:23] <misterm> zabka: don't use alert in the future, learn to use console.log()
[08:13:31] <theagiles> xrated: Ok, at the top of my main file, I php require once, all of the variables and functions.  Would I also need to put that into a html tag and reload that too, so that the php variables are holding the correct data?
[08:13:33] <misterm> zabka: ok, so does autocomplete expect an array of arrays?
[08:13:56] <zabka> misterm : yes, i must give soemthing like : source: ["c++", "java", "php", "coldfusion", "javascript", "asp", "ruby"]
[08:14:09] <misterm> zabka:
[08:14:11] <misterm> z
[08:14:16] <misterm> sorry, keyboard
[08:14:26] <misterm> zabka: read carefully what I am asking
[08:14:51] <misterm> zabka: does it expect an ARRAY *of* ARRAYS, that is an array containing other arrays...I don't know I've never used that plugin
[08:15:01] <testify> Does event.namespace really not work in chrome?
[08:15:14] <misterm> zabka: the example you just gave is a regular array, not an array of arrays
[08:15:42] <zabka> yes, it expects     String, Array or  Callback
[08:16:17] <xrated> theagiles: put what into the html tag? A require directly within the html tag? Why would you if you've already done so.
[08:16:24] <misterm> zabka: so you are saying [ ["foo", "bar"], ["bizz", "bazz"] ] is an acceptable input?
[08:16:48] <zabka> misterm: ok, i will try to change it. thank you. and no
[08:17:46] <misterm> zabka: also, double check the resp object to make sure you have an actual array and not just a string
[08:20:41] <theagiles> xrated: at the top of this file you will see, the require_once that brings in all my php data gets and variables.  Then at the bottom is the actual view of the application.  For now I would just reload the span tag id="like-container".   Which is the selector in the jQuery function.  My question do I need to place that require_once into a div and also reload that so the database calls can be made again to update the variables? http:/
[08:26:17] <surfdue> I am trying to use ui datepicker, and everything jquery is working fine and jquery ui is included, but it is saying that datepicker is not a function that is the only error.
[08:26:58] <xrated> theagiles: no, as long as the script you're calling to outputs what you want in the html tag it'll show up there.
[08:27:15] <xrated> If you want to do it every so often, you'll need to use setTimeout magic since setInterval is a POS
[08:28:41] <theagiles> xrated: Ok, I don't understand why I need setTimeout
[08:29:17] <xrated> You want the content to update every so often or just make a single ajax call?
[08:29:41] <theagiles> single call onClick="function()"
[08:30:04] <xrated> ah okay, then never mind that.
[08:30:20] <misterm> surfdue: do you have the scripts in the right order?
[08:30:30] * xrated hopes you're not using shitty inline javascript like that though
[08:30:30] <surfdue> misterm: yes could jquery tools interfere?
[08:31:04] <surfdue> That was it..
[08:31:09] <surfdue> WTF...
[08:31:18] <surfdue> I just loaded jquery ui after jquery tools.. :/
[08:31:19] <misterm> surfdue: there could be conflicts, yea
[08:31:24] <surfdue> that is stupid
[08:31:33] <surfdue> but then jquery tools breaks :(
[08:32:19] <xrated> Why do you need two UI libraries?
[08:32:24] <kborchers> surfdue: what do you need from jquery tools that UI can't do?
[08:32:34] <surfdue> kborchers: tabs, it looks better. ;)
[08:32:38] <misterm> yea I wouldn't really expect to be able to just throw two UI libraries together and have it work
[08:32:39] <surfdue> kborchers: i suppose i could just take the css
[08:32:58] <misterm> I mean, sure it would be nice, but I wouldn't expect it
[08:33:21] <theagiles> xrated: since I'm really new to the jquery deal, if I just put the function you gave me into script tags, changed the selector the HTML tag reference, and put the function into onclick="".  That's all I need right?
[08:33:22] <xrated> Style the tabs to your liking, like misterm I wouldn't try to use two UI libraries in tandem without getting ready to work out conflicts.
[08:34:51] <xrated> theagiles, I think this is what you're looking for: http://pastebin.com/WaZmM5R9
[08:35:30] <kborchers> surfdue: like others have said, just modify the UI CSS to make your tabs "prettier", just don't use background images like jquery tools does
[08:35:49] <surfdue> kborchers: yuck i saw that
[08:35:53] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/wsXtt4XH <-- i have still no luck
[08:37:17] <theagiles> xrated: 'a#ID' would stand for the the tag where the onclick is located and '#htmlelement' is for the tag being reloaded?
[08:37:18] <misterm> surfdue: what are you getting for arr[0]?
[08:37:25] <xrated> theagiles: yes
[08:37:57] <surfdue> now i cant get tabs to work.. :/
[08:38:08] <zabka>  misterm ir.support@quartal.com
[08:38:31] <zabka> aaa, maybe lack of "
[08:38:33] <xrated> zabka, if the form is small why not just serialize it and pass it as GET arguments in a url?
[08:38:44] <misterm> zabka: what happens if you replace arr with a litteral array?
[08:38:44] <xrated> jQuery autocomplete supports a url as an argument for source
[08:39:02] <theagiles> xrated: but I would have to create multiple functions, because there are different tags for onclick depending on php variables.... see here http://pastebin.com/h6qR66AP
[08:39:57] <misterm> zabka: it looks like the plugin expects the source function to return an array...which is *not* what you are doing
[08:40:43] <darren_p> Hi guys.... I'm trying to write a function which looks for all checkboxes which are checked... then for each of these is put in to an array...
[08:41:25] <darren_p> http://pastebin.com/N4NDbmEb
[08:41:29] <darren_p> I have that so far...
[08:41:33] <xrated> theagiles: You can manage that from within JS. Bit more contrued though.
[08:41:46] <misterm> darren_p: and what's the problem
[08:42:00] <darren_p> it doesn't seem to be loading each value in to the array
[08:42:28] <zabka> misterm: would you mind to give me more clue?
[08:42:29] <misterm> darren_p: can you describe exactly what this selector does?
[08:42:41] <zabka> yes, it expects     string, array or callback
[08:42:47] <misterm> zabka: did you try changing return arr to a literal array?
[08:43:03] <misterm> zabka: to return ["this", "should", "work"]
[08:43:04] <zabka> misterm: yes, still no luck
[08:43:08] <misterm> zabka: exactly
[08:43:16] <darren_p> Ah right... what Im trying to to (i've pasted above), is load the values in to an array... I'm then going to send this via ajax to a php script...
[08:43:18] <misterm> zabka: that shows you something is fundamentally wrong here
[08:43:35] <darren_p> I just need to send an array of the ':checked' values
[08:43:43] <darren_p> I know how to do the ajax part..
[08:43:44] <misterm> zabka: what you have to understand is return, "returns" out of the **immediate function it is inside**
[08:43:53] <misterm> zabka: you are not returning out of the "source" function
[08:43:59] <xrated> darren_p, is your code waiting for the document to load?
[08:44:06] <darren_p> It's just iterating over each checked checkbox, getting the value, and loading it in to an array
[08:44:11] <misterm> zabka: you are returning out of the "success" function...the "source" function returns nothing...so the plugin gets nothing
[08:44:16] <darren_p> no....
[08:44:19] <darren_p> On a click
[08:44:32] <misterm> darren_p: for questions like this it helps a lot to make a jsfiddle
[08:44:35] <misterm> darren_p:
[08:44:43] <misterm> what is this selector supposed to select?
[08:45:00] <darren_p> misterm: checkboxes which are checked..
[08:45:07] <zabka> misterm: but if the plugin expects callback. is it also wrong?
[08:45:14] <theagiles> xrated: anyway you could give me some building blocks to "managing" that through JS?
[08:45:32] <misterm> darren_p: this selects elements *with the classname* "check"
[08:46:04] <misterm> zabka: let me put it this way
[08:46:12] <darren_p> misterm... yes, which are checked
[08:46:39] <misterm> zabka: when you do return arr inside the success function... *you aren't returning to anywhere*
[08:46:54] <misterm> zabka: imagine that when you do that, you are just throwing arr off into outerspace
[08:47:10] <misterm> zabka: it's not going anywhere...you're not giving it to the auto complete function
[08:47:26] <misterm> zabka: the auto complete function is back on earth wondering where it's data is
[08:47:29] <zabka> misterm: ok, thank you very much
[08:50:09] <z0ned> i am programatically calling .change() on a group of text fields in a loop, each .change() calls an "update" method which performs an ajax query. i have set async to false, yet it seems that things still happen out of order. if i put in some alerts, or manually fire the .change() events by typing in the input boxes manually, everything works just fine. does jquery's ajax async=false have some problems with it? what can i do?
[08:50:18] <obscureVar> how do i escape the @ in this: $('#@foo')?
[08:50:25] <misterm> darren_p: what do you expect itemz to be?
[08:51:03] <zabka> how can i access parent vars from callback ?
[08:51:05] <darren_p> a list of values..
[08:51:20] <darren_p> basically, each checkbox will be given a value..
[08:51:38] <darren_p> all selected checkboxes, I need to send the selected values
[08:52:40] <darren_p> I  k now php better... normall I would do a foreach ($blah as $item) {$myarray[] = $item}
[08:53:03] <darren_p> But I'm no expert with javascript.. just trying to figure it
[09:00:02] <misterm> darren_p: http://jsfiddle.net/vrMbx/
[09:02:26] <darren_p> misterm: Thank you, wow.. :)
[09:02:42] <darren_p> misterm: so 'itemz' would hold the array?
[09:03:58] <misterm> darren_p: itemz is an array, yes
[09:04:20] <darren_p> misterm: thank you so much, you've been a really big help
[09:04:53] <misterm> darren_p: np
[09:07:30] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/nJ1i8wk5 <-- could someone help me (line 8)
[09:12:02] <shaft0> Having a weird issue with the validation plugin.  It's telling me that "validate" is not a function, but I have both libraries (jquery and validate) loaded before the call to the function.  The page in question is http://www.indybike.ca/donate does anyone have any ideas why?
[09:13:33] <theagiles> x|food: Can't wrap my head around how to handle multiple onclick links in that javascript
[09:16:58] <kborchers> shaft0: you have included jquery twice on your page. once before validate and then once at the end of the page.
[09:17:59] <shaft0> yep, just noticed that... *facepalm*
[09:19:01] <surfdue> using jquery tabs, how can I update one tab with an ajax post call? i targeted the div created by jquery but my ajax script is notupdating..
[09:19:06] <surfdue> it runs fine no errors
[09:19:53] <kborchers> surfdue: can you create a fiddle or give us a link to your site?
[09:20:14] <surfdue> cannot its under nda
[09:20:38] <zoned> can anyone direct me to a php and/or apache channel?
[09:20:44] <surfdue> kborchers: im using the demo of tabs exactly except put a form in a tab and am trying to update it on submit
[09:20:45] <kborchers> ##php
[09:20:55] <BillCriswell> #httpd is apache I believe.
[09:21:41] <zoned> yeah you need to be registered to get on both of those... and nickserv tells me my password is wrong. how about a way to reset it or get it sent to my email? sendpass doesn't work... i'm getting frustrated.
[09:21:53] <danheberden> i hear they like if you ask apache questions in #nginx
[09:23:05] <theagiles> xrated: what syntax do I use to call the function onclick="WhatGoesHere"?
[09:23:29] <BillCriswell> fucntionname(param); ?
[09:23:32] <surfdue> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/sTfEXK47
[09:24:06] <BillCriswell> zoned: /msg NickServ help
[09:24:53] <kborchers> surfdue: what is #demos?
[09:25:09] <surfdue> its created by jquery tabs according to firebug
[09:25:30] <surfdue> kborchers: http://cl.ly/3X2d471G3b2D1H3h1A26
[09:28:24] <kborchers> surfdue: i think you need to create a div inside your <div class="css-tabs"> after the ul to hold the content of your ajax loaded tabs. then you should be able to target that div with your post content.
[09:28:51] <surfdue> kborchers: how do i define that div when i load tabs
[09:29:07] <kborchers> i think tabs will handle that for you
[09:30:12] <kborchers> surfdue: no, that's not right .... hmmm, let me think a sec
[09:30:49] <surfdue> kborchers: i am using live but someone how i believe ineed to use parent or something iuno..
[09:31:58] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/TZuYEY4g <-- sorry for beeing stupid. could someone look at this again? array contains string values
[09:33:12] <splic> Hello, I'm trying to select all images with a certain width and height but I'm not getting any nodes, am I doing something wrong with my filters? $('img [width="144"][height="216"]');. Thank you
[09:33:14] <surfdue> kborchers: i got it.
[09:33:28] <kborchers> surfdue: what was it?
[09:33:50] <surfdue> kborchers: so i made titles, which were Demos etc.. I had to make divs inside the css-tabs for each one with proper capitalization.
[09:33:54] <surfdue> You were correct, semi. :)
[09:33:57] <BillCriswell> splic: You have a space in there.
[09:34:11] <kborchers> surfdue: makes me feel a little better ;)
[09:34:18] <surfdue> kborchers: smooch :)
[09:34:32] <BillCriswell> splic: You ant img[width=144][height=216]
[09:34:38] <BillCriswell> s/ant/want
[09:34:50] <splic> BillCriswell: Thanks so much
[09:35:07] <BillCriswell> splic: No problem.
[09:37:25] <kborchers> zabka: there are a number of things wrong there ... first, please use semicolons. though JS let's you get away with not using them, when something breaks because of a missing semicolon, it makes it really hard to debug.
[09:37:40] <kborchers> second, you can't just return the array like that
[09:38:50] <zabka> kborchers: i will put the semicolons. how should i return array?
[09:39:02] <kborchers> just a sec, writing up an example
[09:39:18] <zabka> kborchers: thank you
[09:44:04] <kborchers> zabka: without seeing your data or having a way to test it, i'm not sure this will work exactly but it should be close http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/CeSnA/
[09:44:16] <kborchers> just replace your success callback with that
[09:44:31] <kborchers> and get rid of return arr;
[09:44:48] <zabka> thank you, kborchers. let me check it
[09:47:04] <zabka>  thank you so much , kborchers. it works
[09:47:08] <kborchers> cool
[09:54:48] <zabka> and one last question... http://pastebin.com/VBwDqd2q (line 7)
[09:57:00] <kborchers> zabka: tid is available at that point is your code as you have it written. also, don't forget your var statement so that tid is not created as a global.
[09:57:44] <zabka> kborchers: stupid me. thank you again
[09:58:47] <thefalling> In a jquery statement i change the font for the table elements, and if u choose to make the font bigger, the table adjusts the column widths, but if i lower the font size, the table doesnt adjust the column size. Is there anyway to fix this so it resizes the column sizes when i lower the font size?
[09:58:55] <thefalling> so it snaps in so to speak
[10:01:25] <zabka> kborchers: still not available
[10:01:57] <zabka> kborchers: my falutl
[10:02:02] <zabka> fault
[10:02:17] <zabka> tahnk you very much
[10:04:34] <csdco> Can anyone suggest a method of "weighting" draggable elements without using tabledrag?
[10:04:45] <csdco> i.e. divs being dragged around in a containment div
[10:09:20] <kborchers> csdco: not sure what you mean. what are you trying to accomplish?
[10:09:37] <csdco> I have a wrapper that contains 8 square div "boxes"
[10:09:55] <csdco> The user needs to be able to drag and drop them into a "holder" div above, in their preferential order.
[10:10:11] <csdco> I have used tabledrag to do this in the past, but in this instance I cannot use <table>s because of the particular layout.
[10:10:30] <csdco> The only value that I see readily available to me is their absolute positioning coordinates.
[10:10:42] <csdco> and that seems a little sloppy, but I will calculate their weights based upon those if need-be.
[10:11:36] <zabka> and one last question... http://pastebin.com/VBwDqd2q must ask again... how can i figure out what is id of the object, that have called autocomplete
[10:11:39] <kborchers> csdco: have you looked into jQuery UI's draggable, droppable and sortable widgets?
[10:12:37] <csdco> Droppable might be just what I need! Thanks!
[10:12:44] <kborchers> np
[10:17:14] <kborchers> zabka: you need to do this instead var tid = this.element.attr('id');
[10:19:21] <zabka> kborchers: no, getting undefined
[10:20:21] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure then
[10:21:07] <misterm> zabka: you're hitting a similar problem to what you were before
[10:21:17] <misterm> zabka: or at least it looks like it
[10:21:37] <misterm> zabka: you need to be very aware of what function you are inside for a given piece of code
[10:22:05] <zabka> yes, i dont know how can i call the parent var from callback
[10:22:10] <misterm> zabka: things like what exactly "this" is and how "return" behaves are determined by **what function you are inside**
[10:22:34] <sphinxxx> how can you show html code in "text", instead of having the browser actually interpret it?
[10:22:36] <misterm> that is, the "closest" function
[10:23:01] <misterm> zabka: what do you expect "tid" to be?
[10:23:32] <bricker> does anybody have an idea of how I could assign the new object (created in createEvent) to a variable so I can use it in the select callback? http://pastie.org/2397617
[10:24:08] <zabka> i have an event for class $('.autocomplete') . i wanna know the id of object, that called autocomplete
[10:24:39] <insign> has an easy way to insert an image on a input[type=submit]?
[10:25:32] <misterm> zabka: have you checked the docs on the autocomplete plugin?
[10:25:45] <zabka> yes
[10:26:43] <misterm> zabka: I'm pretty sure your answer is in there
[10:27:09] <zabka> i dont see anything similar
[10:27:17] <misterm> zabka: where did you look?
[10:27:38] <zabka> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete
[10:27:47] <misterm> zabka: sure, and did you read all the tabs?
[10:27:49] <zabka> this is what im using
[10:28:42] <thefalling> if i lower the font in td elements in a table, how do i redraw the table so the td heights/widths adjust to the new font size? It works automatically when making the font larger, just not when i lower the font
[10:28:44] <thefalling> any ideas?
[10:28:51] <misterm> zabka: source is just a functiont that returns what data to use for a given string, so the element that caused the autocomplete may not have anything to do with it
[10:29:07] <misterm> zabka: there may be some other *event* that you can check
[10:30:23] <zabka> misterm: other event?
[10:30:51] <zabka> misterm: can i check the id?
[10:31:06] <misterm> zabka: well lets check this first
[10:31:15] <misterm> zabka: do you know what "this" is inside of source?
[10:31:39] <zabka> cant i check the parent attribute?
[10:31:51] <misterm> zabka: maybe
[10:32:03] <misterm> zabka: it all depends on what exactly "this" is inside of source
[10:32:25] <zabka> i dont know what is this in source
[10:32:29] <misterm> zabka: I don't know off hand, but if you do console.log(this) inside the function you should find out
[10:35:30] <misterm> zabka: if you log it, you can explore it, and you'll find the property of it that you need
[10:36:02] <zabka> misterm : ic . thank you very much!
[10:36:22] <misterm> zabka: you want this.element.id
[10:37:27] <misterm> or maybe this.element[0].id
[10:37:45] <misterm> zabka: if you check the console you'll see
[10:59:52] <animus_> Anyone here knowledgable about cross-domain requests?
[10:59:55] <animus_> :D
[11:00:13] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is therea way to match the innerHtml of an element?  (plain text)  without just looping through it and testing?
[11:00:22] <k1ng> hey, i was wondering what would be the best dialog for showing iframe?
[11:00:30] <VeXii> im not unknow to the concept animus_ :)
[11:01:12] <misterm> IanWizard-Cloud: not really
[11:01:51] <IanWizard-Cloud> misterm: yeah, I just thought of another way ;)
[11:01:57] <IanWizard-Cloud> misterm: thx :)
[11:02:11] <xrated> IanWizard-Cloud: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:02:12] <animus_> Haha, well I was just curious about two things, how does the internet function if cross-domain requests aren't allowed (i.e. Stock websites, RSS Feeds, Weather, etc).  How can requests be made if cross-domain requests aren't allowed...?!  I'm new to this, so I looked into it and basically you have to scrape it or use a proxy, is this correct?
[11:02:15] <VeXii> IanWizard-Cloud: what way?
[11:02:23] <xrated> It still does what you said internally though.
[11:02:40] <k1ng> anyone?
[11:02:53] <xrated> What?
[11:03:01] <k1ng> hey, i was wondering what would be the best dialog for showing iframe?
[11:03:05] <k1ng> was my question
[11:03:07] <IanWizard-Cloud> VeXii: it's specific to my code,nothing in general though :(
[11:03:10] <jmar777> animus_: when referring to cross-domain requests, limitations are usually within the context of javascript (e.g., Ajax requests)
[11:03:10] <k1ng> shadowbox?
[11:03:11] <enjoycrf> helo my java friends
[11:03:18] <xrated> I use ColorBox for just about everything
[11:03:27] <animus_> How else can you make requests?
[11:03:39] <k1ng> php proxy?
[11:03:42] <animus_> If you want XML, or want to GET/POST
[11:03:57] <jmar777> animus_: so in general cross-domain requests are perfectly acceptable, but in the context of ajax, there are limitations in place for security reasons (e.g., not making XSRF-style requests too easy)
[11:04:03] <enjoycrf> ppl need to start building their own stuff
[11:04:08] <enjoycrf> stop freeloading
[11:04:19] <VeXii> k1ng: think all block level elements are alle equal good for it
[11:04:32] <xrated> enjoycrf, bit random, no?
[11:04:43] <enjoycrf> i like randomnes
[11:04:51] <jmar777> animus_: you're not going to be able to post cross-domain (if you need support in oldish browsers, anyway). for gets, you can look into JSONP
[11:04:58] <animus_> So what are the other options regarding cross-domain requests.  Like an XML get
[11:05:07] <k1ng> VeXii, i dont know what you mean
[11:05:12] <animus_> But JSONP is server side no?
[11:05:23] <animus_> If it isn't supported you're SOL?
[11:05:23] <k1ng> no
[11:05:33] <VeXii> didnt you wanner show a iframe in a dialog box?
[11:05:34] <xrated> animus_: http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Ajax#Cross-Domain_getJSON_.28using_JSONP.29
[11:05:37] <jmar777> animus_: sort of. the service needs to know how to properly format the response for jsonp
[11:06:04] <animus_> Right, all it does is wrap JSON in script tags, I've looked into it
[11:06:16] <animus_> But I wasn't sure if it's commonly supported
[11:06:24] <xrated> No
[11:07:00] <jmar777> animus_: most "public" APIs will offer JSONP if they're intended to be exposed cross-domain. if JSONP isn't exposed, then there's a good chance that you're using it in a way other than how it was intended
[11:07:21] <animus_> Ahh, that makes sense.  How was this all done prior to JSONP?
[11:07:38] <VeXii> get requests me thinks :D
[11:07:41] <jmar777> animus_: proxies generally (or java applets if you really wanted to get nasty)
[11:08:31] <jmar777> animus_: so, on the domain that served the page needing to make the cross-domain request, you would have something like http://example.com/ajax-proxi?target=http://example-other-domain.com/foo
[11:09:03] <jmar777> that would allow the browser to make a request to the same domain, and the server would make the cross-domain request on the browsers behalf
[11:09:10] <animus_> Yeah, I set up a simple PHP Proxy.  They're everywhere
[11:09:22] <animus_> Just don't care for the whole idea
[11:09:35] <animus_> Seems like more a "work-around" than the correct way
[11:09:52] <jmar777> ya, there are more elegant solutions now that require support for cross-domain request policies, but browser support isn't quite there yet
[11:10:23] <animus_> Hmm, well thanks everyone :D
[11:10:30] <TrueColors> Is it possible to do: $.post ( "process.php?action=contact&hash=2f8a6bf31f", ...
[11:10:34] <animus_> I guess I'll just have to setup JSONP server end
[11:11:10] <jmar777> animus_: that would definitely be my advice
[11:11:51] <animus_> Thanks for the help!
[11:11:55] <jmar777> np
[11:12:00] <animus_> I love when IRC channels are useful :P
[11:12:05] <TrueColors> I realised, .serializeObject() doesn't include the submit button... damn
[11:12:08] <animus_> Never really spent much time in them
[11:12:15] <jmar777> #jquery delivers. ALWAYS. :p
[11:12:28] <animus_> Haha, hyping it up
[11:13:18] <IanWizard-Cloud> Ok, any way to select elements that don't have an attribute (id) set, without using a loop?
[11:13:43] <TrueColors> How can I verify a form has been submitted if the submit button doesn't get transferred into serializeObject()
[11:14:02] <jmar777> IanWizard-Cloud: is that the actual requirement - objects with no id, or are there other things you could target (e.g., class names)?
[11:14:16] <jmar777> IanWizard-Cloud: if the only requirement is that the object doesn't have an id, then you'll need to loop
[11:14:30] <xrated> IanWizard-Cloud: jQuery('el:not([thisallattribute])')
[11:14:49] <TrueColors> $.post ( "process.php?action=contact&hash=2f8a6bf31f", $(this).serializeObject(), function ( data ) { }); ... serializeObject doesn't include the submits, so my php fails because I tend to check if the form was submitted but.. not.. ahhhhhh
[11:14:50] <IanWizard-Cloud> jmar777: nope, lack of an ID, and innerHTML is the only thing that differs.
[11:15:10] <TrueColors> well I guess I could have a hidden field..
[11:15:17] <jmar777> IanWizard-Cloud: hm... there's probably a nice terse jquery syntax for it, but in terms of raw machinery, there will be some looping going on
[11:15:27] <IanWizard-Cloud> xrated: I almost put "il" in there :P
[11:15:37] <IanWizard-Cloud> *"el"
[11:15:43] <xrated> lol
[11:15:52] <xrated> If that doesn't work
[11:16:05] <xrated> You can select the general element, li for examples sake, and use the filter method
[11:16:08] <xrated> It's still a loop
[11:16:13] <xrated> It just looks pretty.
[11:16:50] <IanWizard-Cloud> xrated: I just want to save having the loop in my code...  (and it is a li )
[11:17:57] <xrated> Either of these: http://pastebin.com/3nKTgzjm "should" work
[11:18:27] <TrueColors> <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="1" /> did the trick..
[11:18:28] <TrueColors> blah
[11:20:02] <ravenzz> IanWizard-Cloud http://jsfiddle.net/CB2gG/
[11:21:44] <ravenzz> or $('div:not([id])')
[11:21:45] <ravenzz> of course
[11:35:35] <enjoycrf> (title.search(/[\w\d\s_-]/) > -1)

[11:45:55] <Cap_Africa> hello
[11:46:08] <Cap_Africa> do any one use quicksand arouund here
[11:47:03] <Cap_Africa> i need a little help here
[11:51:02] <theagiles> Is it possible to call a PHP function inside of jquery?
[11:51:26] <aka-> theagiles: no
[11:51:42] <k1ng> aka-, yes
[11:51:46] <k1ng> with ajax
[11:52:01] <aka-> you can make a request to a web server and get the response from a php script but you can not call PHP functions directly
[11:54:38] <theagiles> I have developed a Joomla component, and onClick="" I need to do a specific action, and then refresh either the page or a specific div.
[11:55:33] <k1ng> theagiles, call the php using ajax, then reload the page or whatever
[11:55:34] <aka-> theagiles: then you should create a PHP script that returns your values and make an ajax request to get that value dynamically
[11:55:53] <kaeno> Hi, I have a problem figuring out the width of an element after it has been animated / resized ... the width() function returns the same width before and after the anim ... strange no ?? here is a pastie of what I do

[11:56:22] <theagiles> But I can't use Joomla syntax in that php script right?
[11:57:17] <Cap_Africa> hello
[11:57:30] <Cap_Africa> i want to make a pop out in quicksand on click
[11:57:35] <Cap_Africa> any ideas or help
[11:57:37] <aka-> theagiles: I would assume Joomla has some type of support for handling ajax request but I have no experince with Joomla so I can't say for sure
[11:57:41] <diimdeep> ats/join #apple

[11:58:38] <kurtis> Hey guys, what's the preferred pastebin for this channel?
[11:59:39] <k1ng> kurtis, jsfiddle
[12:00:12] <k1ng> kurtis, http://jsfiddle.net
[12:02:37] <kurtis> k1ng: thanks. i'm going to try to paste my code and then ask for some help -- if I can figure out this complex pastebin, haha
[12:03:30] <rns> anyone know why this isn't changing my select menu to the option that is set with the cookie? http://dpaste.com/598369/
[12:06:34] <kaeno> thanks aka- it worked
[12:06:46] <kurtis> Okay, adding the dependencies would be too hard to get working ? anyways, the code is at http://jsfiddle.net/ShJw8/ ? I think my trouble is in the onchange function with the way I am trying to change that div's background. It just stopped working while changing CSS and I'm not sure why
[12:07:02] <aka-> kaeno: no problem :)
[12:07:52] <obscureVar> kurtis you have mootools loaded fyi.
[12:07:55] <kurtis> I can click, the color changer comes up, I can pick different colors so the alert box goes off ? but it just won't manipulate that Div's CSS background color
[12:08:13] <kurtis> obscureVar: haha yeah ? just ignore those :) It's all jquery, jquery-ui, and this jquery colorpicker plugin I found
[12:09:04] <kurtis> I think my problem is something dumb that I'm overlooking.
[12:09:13] <obscureVar> kurtis is it ('background-color',
[12:09:15] <obscureVar> ?
[12:09:37] <thepacmanfan> anyone here familiar with Colorbox?
[12:09:52] <kurtis> obscureVar: I think you're right that it should be. I just took this straight from the plugin's example. let me change that and give it a try
[12:12:34] <kurtis> obscureVar: nope, didn't work, but still a good suggestion
[12:12:40] <Gary_B> if i add handlers to click events, will they disappear after postback?
[12:12:54] <Gary_B> add handlers dynamically that is
[12:13:07] <misterm> thepacmanfan: did you have a question about it?
[12:13:47] <thepacmanfan> yes i did. it's kind of convoluted, because i'm using a Colorbox plugin for Drupal. galleries are being a PITA.
[12:14:07] <obscureVar> kurtis what if you pass in 'background-color', 'pink'); does that hardcoded color work?
[12:14:07] <misterm> thepacmanfan: if you have a question, just go ahead and ask it, anyone who can answer will
[12:14:11] <thepacmanfan> i cannot force things into galleries like i'd like.
[12:14:37] <thepacmanfan> just wondering if anyone is very familiar with using galleries for classes
[12:14:53] <thepacmanfan> well, because i don't have a particular question, i'm looking for a little troubleshooting help.
[12:15:12] <kurtis> obscureVar: good idea!
[12:15:34] <obscureVar> kurtis: 'hex' may already contain that '#' and not need one appended.
[12:16:05] <obscureVar> er. prepended.
[12:18:22] <kurtis> obscureVar: Okay that didn't change anything ? so my problem must lye in the tree parsing. I changed it to $(this).find('.colorBox').css?. (and added the class colorBox to that div) and still no cigar. Is there a way to debug with firebug so that it skips all of the breakpoints until I'm actually ready to start debugging? It hits a million breakpoints while loading jquery and everything else
[12:19:09] <obscureVar> kurtis i don't know about that.
[12:19:53] <obscureVar> kurtis oh. you can try turning off javascript warnings and using debugger(); in your code. that might work.
[12:20:04] <obscureVar> or is it debugger;?
[12:20:07] <obscureVar> ?debugger
[12:21:18] <kurtis> haha cool, I'll give that a quick google. thanks :)
[12:23:23] <kurtis> obscureVar: Ahh I see the problem!
[12:23:33] <obscureVar> kurtis:  :)
[12:24:04] <sparuvu> hey all,
[12:24:10] <kurtis> obscureVar: when I do $(this).ColorPicker -- I am losing my 'this' context. I did a simple alert and found out the new (this) class is colorPicker (the jquery plugin) ? anyway to get the previous this context?

[12:44:29] <Rushing> IE8 has a decent inspector
[12:44:32] <Rushing> just click the refresh button
[12:44:40] <Rushing> the refresh button in the inspector, i mean
[12:46:02] <Rushing> thanks snover, that clears some things up for me
[12:47:18] <joebott> :Rushing Thanks, I didn't even think to try that button as I assumed it would refresh the page and not just the DOM in the inspector!

[13:30:32] <JJMalina> is there a way to input data in JS into a form field using jQuery?
[13:33:15] <codingrobot> i want do display (construct) different form (in a fieldset) based on a selection in a <select/> element. is there any plugin or a 'pattern' for doing that or should i just do it the usual way by wiping the content of a <div/> and then constructing and appending the form inside?
[13:33:47] <balgarath> JJMalina: $('input#query').attr('value', 'blah')
[13:33:59] <Bower^> JJMalina, I've never done it personally but I imagine if you give the particular <input> field an ID you can just select it and call .attr('value', 'key')
[13:34:36] <JJMalina> Bower^: if it's in JSON I'm assuming I'd have to decode first right?
[13:35:07] <Bower^> Don't think so
[13:35:20] <JJMalina> err sorry, it's just a big javascript object
[13:35:23] <JJMalina> holding all the data
[13:38:52] <David_Bradbury> http://jsfiddle.net/dzhDN/5/ - Alright, why is this animation acting all skippy and getting text stuck in place? :P
[13:39:10] <kborchers> JJMalina, balgarath, Bower^: fyi, when setting the val, no need to do attr('value', 'newval') when you can just do .val('newval')
[13:39:29] <Bower^> oh. nice :)
[13:39:44] <balgarath> kborchers: thanks, good to know - I had tried .value first lol
[13:39:51] <balgarath> which of course did nothing
[13:52:57] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i do sth when an element was removed?
[13:53:22] <Rushing> sth?
[13:54:53] <yan_nick> Rushing: execute code
[13:55:55] <enjoycrf> dun make bad coed ok
[13:56:07] <enjoycrf> ull maek erors
[13:57:22] <rhizmoe> yan_nick: don't remove the element, remove/replace its contents
[13:57:34] <rhizmoe> (inferring the real issue)
[13:58:15] <yan_nick> rhizmoe: hm...and it isn't possible to add a listener if the evnet is deleted?
[13:58:17] <yan_nick> removed*
[13:59:05] <rhizmoe> not really sure what you're talking about, but it seems reasonable that you can't attach behavior to something that isn't there.
[14:03:04] <yan_nick> rhizmoe: but if a script wants to remove an element i can do sth or?
[14:04:19] <kborchers> yan_nick: there is a DOMNodeRemoved event that you can bind to but as usual, IE doesn't like to cooperate with that. This might be helpful http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1623-Ask-Ben-Detecting-When-DOM-Elements-Have-Been-Removed-With-jQuery.htm
[14:04:40] <kborchers> yan_nick: ps, google is your friend ;)
[14:04:53] <yan_nick> kborchers: what would you searching for?
[14:04:55] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't some user action cause that node to be removed?
[14:05:50] <tomkane> anyone: I'm using $.ajax to post to a server. To send the data, I'm using $('#myform').serialize(), but the data is not arriving on the server. The server is being reached and sends its correct (dummy) response. note that  I'm using onsubmit="return false;" in the form html. Is there an inconsistency with that?
[14:06:35] <kborchers> yan_nick: jquery element removed event
[14:06:49] <kborchers> 3rd result
[14:06:49] <tra> tomkane: show the code
[14:07:15] <tomkane> tra: be back in a sec: will paste it.
[14:07:39] <yan_nick> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/McnWT/
[14:07:51] <yan_nick> kborchers: strange or?
[14:08:56] <danzik171> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/McnWT/1/
[14:09:42] <yan_nick> danzik171: yeah got it!"
[14:11:37] <tomkane> tra: here it is -- very brief test case: http://jsfiddle.net/R64xr/
[14:15:48] <kborchers> tomkane: $('#myform').serialize() is case sensitive and your form's id is myForm ... capital F
[14:16:51] <tomkane> kborchers: I can't believe I did that. thanks. Another pair of eyes is what I needed :-)
[14:16:57] <kborchers> np
[14:18:11] <yan_nick> kborchers: but ... how can i get information about the removed element?
[14:18:44] <kborchers> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/McnWT/2/
[14:19:24] <yan_nick> kborchers: and what's about the class?
[14:19:26] <yan_nick> or id?
[14:19:32] <kborchers> yan_nick: so if you do $(event.target) you can use attr, prop what ever to get id, name classes etc.
[14:19:46] <kborchers> $(event.target).attr('class');
[14:20:01] <danzik171> yan_nick:  'this' in the handler is the element that threw the event
[14:20:19] <kborchers> or if you're checking for a specific class  $(event.target).is(".className") will return true or false if the class is there or not
[14:21:42] <mod_cure> fancybox... the 'X' top right corner(close button) it doen'st work with multiple pages
[14:21:57] <kborchers> yan_nick: danzik171 is also right so you could replace event.target in my example with this and still be ok
[14:22:19] <yan_nick> all is fine
[14:22:21] <yan_nick> kborchers++
[14:22:24] <yan_nick> danzik171++
[14:28:19] <gho5t> hi
[14:28:38] <gho5t> i don't understand why my li's are still there after running this in firefox console: $('ul').remove('li');
[14:29:15] <rns> anyone know why this isn't setting my cookies properly on my dropdown menu? http://dpaste.com/598471/
[14:31:44] <snover> gho5t: reading the api documentation would probably be illuminating for you.
[14:31:48] <mod_cure> how do put a link at the top right corner of fancybox ?
[14:36:16] <gho5t> uhh i did
[14:36:58] <gho5t> snover: what is wrong with it
[14:38:10] <gho5t> their example is $('div').remove('.hello');
[14:38:26] <gho5t> how is that different than $('ul').remove('li')
[14:38:45] <gho5t> don't waste my time if you don't know jquery please
[14:48:09] <enjoycrf> hi
[14:48:17] <enjoycrf> how do i add a ' to a char class
[14:48:21] <enjoycrf> regexp
[14:53:05] <sbp> hi. I detached some elements, var elems = $('body').children().detach(); and then used elems.find('#example') to select <div id="example">...</div> in the detached elements. but it doesn't find the div, the .find(...) returns an empty list
[14:53:24] <sbp> so is it not possible to use selector based search on detached elements? or am I doing something wrong?
[14:54:13] <peol> sbp: if it's a direct child of body, you'll have to use .filter
[14:55:45] <sbp> peol: appears to work. thanks very much!
[14:59:48] <wootworks> I'm having trouble understanding how to work with some HTML retrieved with $.get()
[15:00:43] <enjoycrf> u have to woot
[15:00:45] <mod_cure> for some reason this does not close the fancybox window.  $.fn.fancybox.close();
[15:01:31] <wootworks> I'm able to take something and throw it into a div (or whatever), but how can I then manipulate it once it's loaded?
[15:01:59] <enjoycrf> do it inside oncomplete
[15:02:06] <enjoycrf> or success
[15:02:19] <enjoycrf> just google $.ajax
[15:02:26] <enjoycrf> or $.get
[15:02:30] <enjoycrf> or $.post
[15:03:39] <wootworks> Yeah, but once I get a big chunk of HTML (and, yeah it has to be HTML) if I wanted to go in and change something like some text, for instance before I add it to the page
[15:03:59] <wootworks> how would I get that in the success?
[15:05:35] <wootworks> I have something like $.get('tracking.html', function(data) {
[15:05:35] <enjoycrf> just look at the jquery example
[15:06:29] <peol> wootworks: just do var $data = $(data); $data.find('.some-class').text('bla bla'); $data.appendTo('#target-id');
[15:07:25] <wootworks> oh, that makes a lot of sense, thanks peol, I'll give it a shot
[15:07:41] <enjoycrf> yeah see
[15:11:51] <Mac_Weber> is there a specific channel for jquery-mobile?
[15:12:52] <enjoycrf> dood stop making mobile stuff diff from the web
[15:13:02] <enjoycrf> how old is ur dam phone jeez
[15:14:51] <thatryan> anyone know of a plugin to do a full screen site intro? need a static image to fade to a full screen video to fade to a homepage...
[15:15:11] <Mac_Weber> encompass: if you think like this you dont understand a shit about mobile marketing
[15:15:47] <enjoycrf> plz no more marketing
[15:15:58] <enjoycrf> its so annoying
[15:16:17] <David_Bradbury> So I have a section where I'm doing - to $("#logo-slider-body a").stop(); - And it is stopping other things besides "#logo-slider-body a" - Ideas?
[15:17:42] <peol> David_Bradbury: queued? try .stop(true)
[15:18:08] <David_Bradbury> I tried true, true earlier and it froze everything up

[15:18:37] <David_Bradbury> I'll show the actual page in a moment

[15:19:44] <David_Bradbury> At the very bottom
[15:19:48] <David_Bradbury> click the "sort by league"
[15:19:54] <David_Bradbury> ignore the broken images
[15:20:27] <t`owen> what's the problem
[15:20:28] <David_Bradbury> It like stops the animation half way through
[15:20:37] <David_Bradbury> click on a few of the thing
[15:20:46] <t`owen> clear your cache
[15:20:47] <David_Bradbury> the nba, then sort by league
[15:20:54] <David_Bradbury> I just did
[15:21:11] <t`owen> oh i see what you're saying
[15:21:38] <David_Bradbury> It should show all the leagues, then return to the "sort by league" state
[15:21:44] <David_Bradbury> then switch back to the items
[15:21:55] <t`owen> once you've clicked on a league?
[15:21:57] <David_Bradbury> something is stopping the animation though, and I'm not sure what
[15:22:01] <David_Bradbury> Yup
[15:22:10] <David_Bradbury> Once you click on a league it should go back to "Sort by league"
[15:22:23] <t`owen> put it on jsfiddle.net
[15:22:30] <t`owen> kind of hard to debug from the browser
[15:25:23] <David_Bradbury> Hmm, so I added "queue: false" to the animations
[15:25:27] <David_Bradbury> and it seems to have fixed i t
[15:35:42] <kasad> can anyone help me with a regexp, i'm terrible at it :( http://pastie.org/2399080
[15:35:58] <t`owen> David_bradbury, i was in the showre. did you get that up on jsfiddle
[15:36:23] <David_Bradbury> Adding "queue: false" to the animation seems to have fixed it t`owen
[15:36:47] <kasad> so basicaly i need to match the word after > and before word "console"
[15:36:49] <David_Bradbury> The only problem I'm having now is a minor opacity animation but I'm sure I'll figure it out
[15:37:05] <peol> kasad: does username ever have spaces?
[15:37:24] <t`owen> ok, good luck
[15:37:50] <kasad> peol: you're right usernames on windows can have space right?
[15:38:06] <peol> kasad: probably, yes
[15:38:12] <kasad> lemme try
[15:38:16] <kasad> to create user with spaces
[15:39:13] <peol> something like this might work...
[15:39:15] <peol> ?eval ">zch                   console             1  Active      none   19/8/2011 11:48 PM".match(/>(\w+)\s{2,}/)[1]
[15:39:20] <peol> oh, no bot
[15:39:33] <peol> .match(/>(\w+)\s{2,}/)[1]
[15:39:49] <zZzch> peol: soz jdownloader disconnected me
[15:40:03] <zZzch> peol: yes windows allow spaces in username :(
[15:40:10] <peol> .match(/>(\w+)\s{2,}/)[1]
[15:40:12] <peol> zZzch: ^
[15:40:30] <peol> or, wait, there might be loads i guess
[15:40:41] <zZzch> yes?
[15:42:43] <sk8ball> hey what's up people, do you think there is room to compete in the freshbooks, cashboard, odesk, etc... online time management/invoicing niche? There seems to be only a few real players in the market and a quality solution w/ competitive pricing should be able to compete.  What do you all think?  for that matter... what are you all using?
[15:45:23] <kasad> peol: thanks man
[15:46:07] <t`owen> sk8ball, there's always room for newcomers if you have a good product and competative prices
[15:46:27] <t`owen> also try to find something that none of the others do and do that
[15:47:39] <orentanay> is there a way to make a chain pause in the middle until a variable changes from false to true? thanks.
[15:49:23] <t`owen> orentanay - can you put an example on jsfiddle
[15:49:52] <orentanay> sure, one sec...
[15:50:35] <ChrisJ_> can anyone here try to help out with a jqGrid issue?
[15:51:21] <t`owen> chris - what is your isue
[15:52:38] <ChrisJ_> I've got several hidden columns, and their data is not posting when editing a row
[15:55:08] <t`owen> so a PHP problem?
[15:55:40] <ChrisJ_> No... I figured I was doing something wrong in jqGrid. I'm not using PHP
[15:56:08] <ChrisJ_> all of the columns that are visible to the user are posting just fine...
[15:56:18] <orentanay> t`owen: http://jsfiddle.net/vJVL7/ this is the easiest way I would think if showing you what I was hoping to accomplish.
[15:59:59] <discountrobot> what about a while loop?
[16:00:26] <Dr4g> I've included jquery-ui and it says my element has no method "effect()"
[16:00:34] <Dr4g> What did i miss ?
[16:00:35] <t`owen> chris - when you say 'aren't posting' you don't mean by means of the php $_POST ?
[16:01:08] <t`owen> or did you mean something else by 'aren't posting'
[16:01:29] <ChrisJ_> What I mean to say is that on the server side when I dump what is the equivlant of $_POST in my language, the hidden column values are not there, but the visible column values are.
[16:01:46] <t`owen> oh, i see
[16:01:48] <t`owen> what language are you using
[16:01:52] <ChrisJ_> ColdFusion
[16:01:56] <t`owen> O_O
[16:01:58] <t`owen> foreign to me
[16:02:09] <ChrisJ_> Shouldn't matter, I think this is a jqGrid issue...
[16:02:10] <t`owen> the columns are just table elements?
[16:02:20] <t`owen> i've never used jqgrid
[16:02:24] <ChrisJ_> I've posted in a couple of their forums, but gotten no responses so far...
[16:02:29] <Dr4g> What did i do wrong? :P
[16:02:39] <t`owen> are you posting some certain attribute, like value
[16:02:43] <discountrobot> What is the best way to navigate around ones site, i am currently using GET. but i am not sure that it is the most secure thing to use.
[16:02:45] <t`owen> or html
[16:03:01] <ChrisJ_> ah... yeah, you'd have to be familiar with jqGrid. it's a pretty complex little plugin for jQuery.
[16:04:39] <Dr4g> Guys, i've included jquery 1.4.2 and then jquery ui 1.8.13 and then my custom JS file. I try .effect() on my dom element and it says the method .effect() doesn't exists - here is my code: http://pastebin.com/LutUJ9KY
[16:05:30] <ChrisJ_> Dr4g I can't get there because of a company firewall... wanna try jsfiddle.net?
[16:05:40] <ChrisJ_> I have to leave soon, but I might be able to help quickly.
[16:06:19] <ChrisJ_> also, is there a reason you're using 1.4.2 instead of 1.6.2??
[16:09:21] <ChrisJ_> no, Dr4g?
[16:10:19] <ChrisJ_> okay, i'm out. good luck Dr4g... hope you find help.
[16:13:11] <Dr4g> I'm back, sorry.
[16:20:48] <Techdeck> hey guys, I need a way to load an image in the background and once done, set the CSS background of a div to it. I used:  $('<img />').attr('src', url).load(function() { ... } -- but it doesn't seem to work very well in some cases (some images just wont load because I get 302 found)
[16:21:06] <Techdeck> so I tried using $.ajax .. in that case it works, but it seems to always go to the server, even if I have local cache of the image
[16:21:08] <Techdeck> any ideas?
[16:21:39] <Techdeck> Also, seems that $.ajax only accepts 4 dataTypes: (xml, json, script, or html) :(
[16:22:37] <cheesecow> check for local cache first and if it isn't there make the ajax call
[16:22:48] <cheesecow> otherwise just throw the img in there
[16:24:24] <Techdeck> cheesecow, how do I check local cache?
[16:25:22] <cheesecow> hrrm
[16:26:47] <cheesecow> yea disregard that
[16:27:15] <cheesecow> i was thinking about localstorage
[16:27:23] <cheesecow> could maybe use that
[16:27:34] <cheesecow> but its only html5
[16:28:59] <cheesecow> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2446740/post-loading-check-if-an-image-is-in-the-browser-cache
[16:29:02] <cheesecow> maybe?
[16:33:01] <jeffreyjames> hi jquery community. please don't flame me too much for being OT, but I was wondering if anyone know if there are more modern/better alternatives for a web forum than simplemachines/phpbb/etc.
[16:33:13] <jeffreyjames> (and what they are called)
[16:33:26] <jeffreyjames> I know of vanilla forums, but they're not quite robust enough
[16:40:01] <fairwinds> hi. how can I get list of files I have chosen from <input type="file" name="file" multiple>
[16:57:30] <tmayr> is there any good plugin to manage inputs with tags and autocomplete?
[17:03:19] <insign> tmayr, is likely that there has already used Google?
[17:04:43] <tmayr> yeah ive looked around, have some reults but was wondering what most people use tbh :P
[17:21:25] <SIDU> $(this).parent().children().input[checkbox]=this.checked()
[17:21:50] <SIDU> coldhead: hi, can you fix above for me ?
[17:22:17] <coldhead> i'm with you up to the point where it says children()
[17:22:21] <coldhead> the rest i don't get
[17:22:45] <coldhead> $(this).siblings(':checked') ?
[17:23:04] <SIDU> in a form: when you click the checkbox, and checkAll, uncheckall of any checkbox in the form
[17:23:39] <SIDU> coldhead: jq master :D
[17:23:52] <coldhead> hardly :P
[17:24:09] <coldhead> that willl probably need some work but it's a start
[17:25:18] <SIDU> $('#formID').AllInputCheck.each=$('#checkAll').checked ?
[17:26:08] <SIDU> how to set all checkbox of formID ?
[17:27:09] <SIDU> $('#formID').children(':checked')=$(this).checked ?
[17:27:22] <coldhead> $('#checkAll').click(function () {if ($(this).is(':checked')) $('#formID inputptype=checkbox]').attr('checked', 'checked');})
[17:27:42] <coldhead> except like syntactically correct
[17:28:18] <SIDU> let me test ..
[17:30:44] <SIDU> coldhead: i find this is smart:
[17:30:47] <SIDU> $(function () {
[17:30:49] <SIDU> 	$('#checkall').click(function () {
[17:30:50] <SIDU> 		$(this).parents('fieldset:eq(0)').find(':checkbox').attr('checked', this.checked);
[17:30:52] <SIDU> 	});
[17:30:53] <SIDU> });
[17:31:17] <SIDU> what does line 1 means : $(function)
[17:31:29] <Eviltwin> $('#formID :checkbox').each(function(){$(this).attr('checked','checked')});
[17:31:30] <SIDU> http://briancray.com/tests/checkboxes/index.html
[17:31:32] <Eviltwin> Please don't paste code here
[17:31:37] <Eviltwin> Paste links to pastebin or something
[17:32:10] <Eviltwin> $(fn) is an alias for $(document).ready(fn)
[17:32:13] <SIDU> :)
[17:32:26] <SIDU> ah.
[17:32:30] <coldhead> SIDU: you must never ever use that shorthand form for ready()
[17:32:43] <coldhead> because someday someone will read it
[17:32:48] <coldhead> and come to #jQuery asking what it means
[17:32:54] <coldhead> and i will have to tell them to never ever use it
[17:32:57] <Eviltwin> That's exactly why I use it
[17:33:02] <coldhead> you are so evil
[17:33:06] <Eviltwin> Check the nick
[17:33:16] <coldhead> it's fine for quickies but it's not readable code
[17:33:22] <coldhead> eschew obfuscation!
[17:33:27] <Eviltwin> It's lazy is what it is
[17:33:48] <SIDU> 2 masters fight :D
[17:34:09] <Eviltwin> We're actually agreeing
[17:34:18] <Eviltwin> We're agreeing that you shouldn't use it
[17:34:21] <Eviltwin> Specifically you
[17:34:22] <SIDU> where are you ? coldhead and Eviltwin  ? which city ? am i in your city as well ?
[17:34:33] <Eviltwin> Urbana, IL
[17:34:43] <SIDU> ah the states.
[17:34:46] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:34:49] <SIDU> too far away
[17:34:51] <coldhead> i am in the host city for the 2000 summer olympics
[17:35:01] <coldhead> i <3 IL though
[17:35:07] <SIDU> coldhead: well we are in the same city
[17:35:18] <SIDU> coldhead: i m going to meet u one day :D
[17:35:26] <coldhead> where abouts are you, SIDU ?
[17:35:37] <SIDU> sutherland
[17:35:46] <coldhead> the shire
[17:35:51] <SIDU> yep
[17:35:55] <SIDU> where are you ?
[17:36:10] <coldhead> inner west
[17:36:14] <coldhead> SIDU: http://sydjs.com/
[17:36:23] <coldhead> you have a month to prepare for that :)
[17:36:41] * Techdeck pokes ajpiano
[17:36:49] <Techdeck> ajpiano, hey man, are you around by any chance?
[17:37:24] <SIDU> coldhead: can not open the web
[17:38:56] <coldhead> oh no :(
[17:40:48] <bricker1> is this a hash? (I'm new to jquery/js): { key: value, key2: value2 } I'm using jQuery.rest and it takes an option for data in either string or hash format, I'm wondering if I should be able to pass that in
[17:41:29] <coldhead> you can think of it as a hash, bricker1
[17:41:38] <coldhead> that will work provided value and value2 are defined
[17:42:44] <bricker1> coldhead: Thanks. It's not accepting the option (supposed to pass it into params, but just leaving it out)â¦ perhaps I'm doing something else wrong.
[17:42:59] <coldhead> ?p @ bricker1
[17:43:04] <coldhead> oh no bot >: |
[17:43:14] <coldhead> pastebin it somewhere, bricker1
[17:43:21] <bricker1> coldhead: okay, one second
[17:45:52] <bricker1> coldhead: http://pastie.org/2399502 This is using fullcalendar and jquery.rest. There are no errors, but the second option in $.read should pass that hash into the url query string. If I change it to a string, it gets passed through. Mostly I'm just curious why it won't accept that hash.
[17:46:52] <bricker1> the jquery.rest documentation says that it should accept a hash
[17:47:00] <bricker1> (https://github.com/lyconic/jquery.rest)
[17:50:36] <Eviltwin> bricker1: I guess that's the first time documentation has ever lied :P
[17:50:50] <bricker1> Eviltwin: heh, you're probably right
[17:51:48] <coldhead> this is the relevant line in rest https://github.com/lyconic/jquery.rest/blob/master/jquery.rest.js#L47
[17:52:11] <coldhead> it looks like it's expecting the url to be in the hash
[17:52:36] <coldhead> if you have more than one arg it assumes you're not using a hash
[17:53:01] <coldhead> capiche?
[17:53:18] <Eviltwin> Well you can still probably have a hash for data
[17:53:33] <Eviltwin> bricker1: Let's see your code as a pastebin
[17:53:51] <Eviltwin> (Or as a link from wherever)
[17:54:44] <bricker1> coldhead: yeah I think I understand. Eviltwin: Thanks for the offer, but it's working as a string so I don't really want to spend any more time on this.
[17:55:10] <bricker1> I just thought the hash looked a little nicer but it's not a big deal
[17:56:27] <SIDU> i often have this line many places, can it be rewrite shorter: document.seekform.submit()
[17:57:06] <SIDU> $('formID').submit() ?
[17:57:11] <SIDU> #
[17:59:49] <coldhead> that should work
[18:00:44] <Mark___> hello? anyone there?
[18:01:03] <Mark___> any devlopers OL?
[18:01:17] <Mark___> i have a question regarding recaptcha thingy when loaded using jquery .load()
[18:01:44] <Mark___> anyone who knows about this problem please do...
[18:03:26] <Mark___> hellow?
[18:03:29] <Mark___> hello?
[18:04:27] <Eviltwin> Mark___: Please describe your problem
[18:04:36] <Eviltwin> People who can help you will speak up
[18:05:07] <Mark___> hmmm let me see...
[18:05:26] <Mark___> i have a recaptcha code snippet inserted in on a page....
[18:05:35] <Mark___> its the ajax part of recaptcha thingy...
[18:05:53] <Mark___> then that page is loaded into a bigger page using .load()
[18:06:10] <Mark___> but it wont display the widget when loaded into the bigger page...
[18:07:57] <coldhead> Mark___: i don't think load() will execute any javascript in the pages it loads
[18:08:03] <Mark___> lets put it this way... recaptcha widget is inserted into the "sample.html" then sample.html is loaded into a <div> in "index.html" but when that happens it wont show the widget
[18:08:04] <coldhead> might that be the problem?
[18:08:13] <Mark___> ohh?
[18:08:48] <Mark___> but i also tried inserting the php code of the recaptcha change the sample.html into php but stil it wont
[18:09:05] <Mark___> does load() loads iframes??
[18:09:29] <Mark___> cuz i read the php lib of the recaptcha it shows that the image from the recapthca is iframes
[18:11:54] <coldhead> Mark___: it probably uses javascript AND an iframe
[18:12:26] <Mark___> hmmm yeah and it wont load in a div
[18:12:41] <Eviltwin> Read the comments for http://api.jquery.com/load/
[18:12:50] <Eviltwin> People talk about reCaptcha
[18:13:06] <Eviltwin> Or person rather
[18:13:10] <Mark___> yep already did theres this guy talks about recaptcha but no one replied :D
[18:13:28] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you're out of luck
[18:14:53] <Mark___> :D
[18:15:06] <Mark___> sir do you know anyother recaptcha widgets?
[18:15:23] <Mark___> aside from that of google
[18:18:02] <SIDU> php: echo 'A'; PK echo "A"; //is it really good to use ' instead of " ?
[18:18:27] <SIDU> sorry , wrong question :)
[18:18:58] <SIDU> php: echo 'A',$a; PK echo 'A'.$a; //is it really good to use . instead of , ?
[18:19:28] <SIDU> my lazy style = echo "A$a";
[18:21:32] <coldhead> this is a better question for the fascist jerks in ##php
[18:23:45] <SIDU> coldhead: #php is very selfish, i can only watch other talk, i can not ask

[18:43:28] <nul0op> yeah. how the hell can I download the *source* non-minified code of a jquery plugin ?
[18:43:36] <nul0op> hu ? that's seems impossible !!
[18:44:27] <kborchers> nul0op: what plugin? it's only possible if the author provides the non-minified version for download
[18:44:49] <nul0op> bubblepopup for example.
[18:46:51] <nul0op> that's a shame. the guy who is distributing this plugin only in .min version doesn't want others to improve it ?

[20:32:25] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I check if an element is disabled ?
[20:33:13] <kborchers> tomoyuki28jp: $("#element").is(":disabled");
[20:33:49] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: thanks, let me try that one.
[20:34:39] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: On FF3.6 on mac, it always return false.
[20:37:53] <kborchers> then the element isn't disabled or you're not selecting it correctly. does this return true http://jsfiddle.net/Pw4Jn/ ?
[20:38:18] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: But Firebug shows me the element is disabled.
[20:39:07] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: Perhaps disabled does not work in a links?
[20:40:14] <kborchers> i don't think that prop is available for anchor elements
[20:41:10] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: oh really. Thanks a lot for your help.

[21:27:22] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there any way to uniquely identify a particular element as a selector?
[21:27:49] <min|dvir|us> Particularly, I'd like to get the next sibling element of a particular element matching a criterium.
[21:28:21] <letterpress1> an idâ¦?
[21:28:32] <min|dvir|us> letterpress1: What if it doesn't have an ID, as in my case?
[21:29:51] <letterpress1> what criterium would you be matching?
[21:42:46] <min|dvir|us> I'm really sorry. I got kicked off my Internet.
[21:42:49] <min|dvir|us> Someone was talking to me.
[21:43:16] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to uniquely refer to an element without an ID.
[21:43:33] <min|dvir|us> My goal is to get the element's next sibling matching a certain criterium.
[21:44:52] <min|dvir|us> Anyone have any thoughts?
[21:47:13] <lenswipe> hey guys
[21:47:21] <lenswipe> http://95.146.92.53/stpeters2/
[21:47:33] <lenswipe> anyone able to tell me why my jquery code aint working?
[21:47:58] <lenswipe> for instance $("table tr:even").addClass("gray") has no effect in my html, but pasting it into the browser console works perfectly...
[21:48:02] <lenswipe> anyone any ideas?
[21:48:56] <lenswipe> actually scratch that, that works
[21:49:01] <lenswipe> but theres something else that aint workin
[21:51:08] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to uniquely refer to an element without an ID. How?
[21:53:36] <min|dvir|us> Anyone?
[21:57:57] <letterpress1> min|dvir|us what's the criterion for matching?
[21:58:13] <min|dvir|us> letterpress1: #content a[name] or #content a[name] h2.
[21:58:58] <letterpress1> and you just need to get the next element that has that name?
[21:59:30] <min|dvir|us> letterpress1: Well, that fulfills that criterium.
[22:00:11] <min|dvir|us> *the element that
[22:00:19] <letterpress1> what criterium?
[22:02:56] <min|dvir|us_> letterpress1: Sorry.
[22:02:58] <min|dvir|us_> What did I miss?
[22:03:08] <letterpress1> i asked what criterium?
[22:03:15] <letterpress1> the name?
[22:03:36] <min|dvir|us> letterpress1: the criterium is either "#content a[name]" or "#content a[name] h2".
[22:05:40] <letterpress1> sorry man, off to bed for me. good luck!
[22:05:47] <min|dvir|us> .... Thanks.
[22:10:46] <min|dvir|us> Does anyone know how I can uniquely identify an element without an ID?
[22:11:18] <min|dvir|us> I just need to get the element directly after it matching "#content a[name]" or "#content a[name] h2".
[22:47:37] <cordoval> I am trying to set the date select elements on a form ').val(data.month);
[22:47:42] <cordoval> but it is not working
[22:47:54] <cordoval> i think the data.month is a month name
[22:48:02] <cordoval> whereas the value requires a number i think
[22:48:07] <cordoval> anyone has a hint?
[22:53:38] <madprops> how can I check of im at the top of the page? $(document).position().top?
[22:53:48] <cordoval> gah
[23:21:08] <javaman> hmm
[23:21:13] <dr0id> hmm
[23:21:17] <javaman> ahoi
[23:31:39] <cordoval> I have a date I assigned to data.dob
[23:31:55] <cordoval> when I passed it to a variable how can i split these into month year and day?
[23:32:06] <cordoval> it does not seem to accept data.dob.day or .month
[23:32:09] <cordoval> etc
[23:32:12] <cordoval> :( anyone
[23:32:15] <cordoval> ?
[23:34:33] <cordoval> oh getMonth

[23:34:51] <progrock> anyone familiar with somethign that allows you to get functionality like defineProperty to work cross browser?

[23:40:29] <progrock> I take that as a no, damn :(
[23:40:36] <silv3r_m00n> is this correct >> input[name*=rate][name*=_hint]   ? I want the input control which has both rate and hint in its name
[23:43:45] <t`owen> probably have to do two declarations
[23:44:43] <t`owen> input[name*="rate"], input[name*
[23:44:53] <t`owen> "hint"]
