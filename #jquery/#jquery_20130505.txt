[00:07:53] <wer0ckz> <Gazpacho> then you probably want more than one dialog element <- may i ask why? i can create 3 dialog box using 1 element
[00:08:40] <Gazpacho> you asked how to go "back" from one dialog to another
[00:08:50] <wer0ckz> yes
[00:08:55] <Gazpacho> you can't go "back" if you don't have an element that keeps the settings for each dialog
[00:09:02] <wer0ckz> i can do tha by calling a function
[00:09:08] <wer0ckz> is there a way to go back not calling a function?
[00:10:40] <Gazpacho> seems like a pointless question, honestly
[00:10:50] <Gazpacho> is there something wrong with functions?
[00:11:41] <Gazpacho> "I can travel into space, but how do I do it without a rocket?"
[00:16:13] <Gazpacho> you can't go "back" by calling a function if you only use one element, by calling a function or any other way
[00:16:53] <diverdude> Hello, when i right click here: http://jsfiddle.net/ATyjn/7/ the menu appears as desired. However if i dont hold down the tight mouse button and drag it away from the menu, the menu disappers again. How do i avoid that?
[00:18:17] <Gazpacho> i'm not seeing thta in chrome
[00:20:30] <diverdude> Gazpacho, im using chrome
[00:20:41] <diverdude> Gazpacho, it happens all the time :(
[00:21:07] <diverdude> Gazpacho, its because the click event is invoked also
[00:21:10] <Gazpacho> wer0ckz: what I mean is that when you call dialog on the same element many times, you are just creating a new dialog over and over
[00:21:36] <Gazpacho> I right-click, move the mouse away, and the menu just stays there forever
[00:21:39] <diverdude> oh not for me
[00:21:55] <diverdude> Gazpacho, yeah, but dont move the mouse
[00:22:00] <diverdude> just right click
[00:22:21] <Gazpacho> yeah, still stays open
[00:22:22] <diverdude> the menu just disappears again then
[00:22:40] <diverdude> in my computer it disappears
[00:24:47] <diverdude> Gazpacho, i dont understand it

[00:40:11] <phiz> vi
[00:48:13] <Gazpacho> agreed
[00:51:11] <wer0ckz> Gazpacho: thanks for helping me earlier
[00:51:30] <wer0ckz> one more please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/BPXW7/3/ - the 2nd dialog, show: fade is not working.
[00:52:12] <Feliciana> is ape-project.org good for a real time chest browser game ?
[00:52:12] <introom> hi this is my data http://bpaste.net/show/96479/
[00:52:35] <introom> I wanna get the values of <td>0<td> inside each tr
[00:53:27] <introom> i've set that <td> with display:none, so I can successfully select all those tds with $('td:hidden')
[00:53:58] <introom> when I run $('td:hidden').text(), it just returned [000000], but I wanna something like [0, 0, 0, 0,0] a list not a string
[00:58:28] <okdamn> hi there
[00:58:33] <okdamn> i got a strange problem
[00:59:12] <okdamn> i defined function loading(){ return somenthing; } and i have $.ajax({ //... beforeSend:function(){ loading(); }});
[00:59:22] <okdamn> first time i launch the request all works perfect
[00:59:34] <okdamn> second time it returns always loading() is not a function :/
[00:59:38] <okdamn> how it could be??
[01:03:38] <Gazpacho> can't really tell without seeing how you make the calls
[01:06:03] <Gazpacho> introom: $.map($('td:hidden').toArray(), function() { return $(this).text(); })
[01:06:14] <Gazpacho> oops
[01:06:24] <Gazpacho> introom: $.map($('td:hidden').toArray(), function(elt) { return $(elt).text(); })
[01:06:31] <introom> elt?
[01:06:48] <Gazpacho> short for element
[01:06:55] <Gazpacho> could be anything
[01:09:43] <okdamn> can someone take a look at this please http://pastebin.com/fHuiMDhs
[01:09:58] <okdamn> when i launch the ajax for the second time it returns error "loading is not a function"
[01:10:02] <okdamn> wtfff ??? :O
[01:10:14] <okdamn> first time i launch it's everything ok
[01:13:02] <Gazpacho> okdamn: it's probably not the best idea to have two global things that are both called "loading"
[01:13:10] <Gazpacho> the function and the timer
[01:14:03] <introom> Gazpacho: thanks, how do you debug the js files. I find everytime wrap it in console.log cumbersome
[01:14:30] <Gazpacho> introom: I use the chrome debugger too
[01:14:45] <introom> Gazpacho: console.log ?
[01:14:49] <okdamn> Gazpacho:  uhmm oh damn you're right
[01:14:49] <Gazpacho> breakpoints
[01:14:54] <okdamn> damn right
[01:14:56] <okdamn> let me try
[01:18:41] <tab1293> how can I store a json object to an element with the data function?
[01:19:15] <tab1293> im trying to do $("#idname").data("keyName", jsonObject)
[01:19:38] <tab1293> and then retrieve it like var obj = $("idname").data("keyName")
[01:19:44] <tab1293> obj is coming back undefined
[01:20:00] <Gazpacho> tab1293: obviously
[01:20:03] <tab1293> $("#idname").data("keyName")
[01:20:05] <Gazpacho> proofread your code
[01:20:07] <Gazpacho> oh
[01:20:32] <tab1293> yeah that was just a typo
[01:20:32] <Gazpacho> well, I don't know
[01:21:27] <okdamn> i fixed Gazpacho you were right
[01:21:36] <okdamn> thanks
[01:24:02] <Gazpacho> tab1293: are you deleting and re-creating the element in between?
[01:24:24] <tab1293> i got it working Gazpacho it was another typo in my code
[01:28:59] <diverdude> i have x and y coordinates from a mouseclick. how can i figure out which element on the page those belong to?
[01:30:14] <Abbas5> i have a div with <input[file]><br><input[text]><br><input[file]><input[text]>, i've set it so when a file is chosen, using the input[file], it shud add its path in the input[text] field right next to it
[01:30:34] <Abbas5> right now, if one file is changed, its path is duplicated on both the input[text] fields
[01:31:05] <Abbas|> how do i tell jQuery that on file-change, update the path only in the input[text] field RIGHT AFTER that specific input[file] field?
[01:38:37] <Gazpacho> diverdude: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.elementFromPoint but getting the element to handle the click itself would be a better approach
[01:39:31] <Gazpacho> diverdude: you might look at the source code of Kick Ass to see if they use some other approach
[01:41:40] <diverdude> Gazpacho, yeah ok...i found a way : http://jsfiddle.net/46QV7/
[01:41:54] <Gazpacho> Kick Ass uses elementFromPoint
[01:41:57] <diverdude> Gazpacho, but for some reason the text moves into the box when right clicked..hmm why?
[01:42:57] <Gazpacho> the text is in the box the whole time. the box moved because you moved it
[01:43:38] <diverdude> Gazpacho, no im adding a new div
[01:44:46] <Gazpacho> no you're not
[01:44:55] <Gazpacho> $('div') doesn't create a new div
[01:45:41] <diverdude> ahright
[01:45:45] <diverdude> got it now :)
[01:45:46] <diverdude> thx

[05:10:37] <simpleirc> hi
[05:33:20] <hazamonzo> Howdy folks. So im working on a project that requires a build a UI of sorts using bootstrap. With this UI i want to "load in" other HTML documents (these html documents already have their own CSS and javascript within the head). The problem im getting is when i use $.get(), the html CSS os overriding the bootstrap CSS. Whats the best way to go about avoiding this?
[05:33:37] <hazamonzo> Im guessing something like using an iframe would work but i'd like to think of a better solution if there is one
[05:33:55] <hazamonzo> And feedback would be much appreciated :)
[05:39:15] <RNT> !topic
[05:42:18] <pfFredd> what's the best way to pass a parameter from a link in a list view (<ul><li>) to a a new data-role:page within the same html file?
[05:55:23] <hazamonzo> Okay how about this. How might i go about loading in a HTML document into my site and remove its <head><style> tags BEFORE it screws with the main site CSS?
[05:56:16] <hazamonzo> IM thinking i'll want to store the $.get HTML document into a var, strip the head > style HTML from that var string and THEN load the resulting styleless HTML to the page / div
[06:06:22] <sacho> sounds good.
[06:08:20] <diverdude> hmm how do i align the dates under each other here: http://jsfiddle.net/apaxr/3/ ?
[06:22:37] <wilkinsmc> does chaining things and caching things really improve performance?
[06:22:54] <wilkinsmc> caching = making a selector a variable if accessed more than once
[06:27:48] <sacho> "really improve performance"?
[06:32:20] <wilkinsmc> does it actually improve peformance
[06:32:24] <wilkinsmc> grammar nazi
[06:33:01] <sacho> What do you mean by "actually improve performance"
[06:33:05] <sacho> it's a nonsensical question
[06:33:33] <sacho> if you're asking whether creating multiple objects instead of reusing one is better performance, then duh.
[06:33:53] <sacho> If you're asking whether it'd impact your specific project, then you've given little to no information to give a response to that
[06:35:22] <wilkinsmc> i guess i'll have to test
[06:35:44] <wilkinsmc> but i have at least thirty instances where I can cache a selector
[06:35:51] <wilkinsmc> where I use it two or more times
[06:36:45] <sacho> That doesn't really mean anything
[06:58:09] <tryggvib> hi, is there a way to use jQuery.extend() but only overwrite values with the latter object's 'defined' properties (i.e. not undefined properties)
[06:58:58] <tryggvib> I want to allow html5 data-something attributes to be used for configurations
[06:59:10] <gvo> I'm loading a dynamic image into a div and it takes a while.  Is there an event I can hook to that will tell me when it is done?
[07:00:51] <rue> tryggvib: extend(a, b)  doesnâ€™t overwrite any values where in b itâ€™s undefined, I donâ€™t think?
[07:00:57] <tryggvib> I can also just build up the data attribute object via a lot of ifs (there might also be a way to skip undefined values in the object constructor)
[07:01:21] <tryggvib> rue: hmm... ok, I just assumed it (try before you ask eh?)
[07:01:29] <rue> Yep :)
[07:05:20] <gvo> I tried change but that didn't work.
[07:06:42] <tryggvib> rue: thanks a lot, you were right :)
[07:09:09] <stewarf> Hi
[07:27:32] <hugo_moss> when you're creating a plugin, and you create a function definition like $.fn.myPlugin = function(){..., inside that function this refers to the jquery object referring to all elements in the dom, what actually sets the this object to be those elements?
[07:34:08] <kosibar1> hugo_moss: jQuery('div.myPluginElements').myPlugin(); The 'div.myPluginElements' sets them.
[07:35:09] <hugo_moss> ahh ok
[07:35:12] <hugo_moss> thank you

[07:53:04] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I have a jQuery plugin that loads jQuery if it's not already loaded. Now, I would like to create a hook like MyPlugin.loaded(fucntion(){ some stuff that is called once my plugin is up-and-running }); ... Would anyone know what this is called so I can find some tutorials on Google? Cheers in advance :)
[07:55:15] <JD-Robbs> Thing is: I can only think of storing callbacks in an object and then calling them once the plugin is running... No idea if that's best practice though.
[08:04:52] <pfFredd> do jquery plugins work with jquerymobile as well?
[08:26:05] <jop008> best way to check online offline?
[09:03:18] <jBryan> hi, question about bootstrap popover. how can I preserve popover when I hide it? because it was automatically remove from dom
[09:10:25] <SmokingSlim> how can i target elements loaded with load() in jquery ?
[09:11:06] <SmokingSlim> like $(element).load(' #content', function() { $('target').doSomething(); })
[09:11:12] <shoky> JD-Robbs: you can use deferreds:   var loadDfd = $.Deferred();   and when your plugin is loaded:  loadDfd.resolve();     and the loaded function:  MyPlugin.loaded = function(callback) { loadDfd.done(callback) };
[09:11:14] <SmokingSlim> it just returns [Object object]
[09:12:38] <shoky> SmokingSlim: what do you mean? whatcha trying to do
[09:14:15] <SmokingSlim> shoky I'm dynamically loading content into a div with jQuerys load() function. Problem is tho, i want to target some elements within the load(data) to run a function on
[09:14:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to enlarge the "toggle" area? The toggle now happens immediately when the user goes over the edge of the contaainer... Is it possible to only hide it on container + 100px or something?
[09:14:52] <SmokingSlim> click() dosn't work as its dynamically loaded. I've tried on('click', function()) too without success
[09:15:16] <shoky> SmokingSlim: and where are you getting [Object object] ..?
[09:15:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This is what I currently use to toggle on a submenu... http://pastebin.com/KnxR1e5p
[09:16:02] <SmokingSlim> shoky if i console.log($('target element')) within the load() function, it returs [Object object] instead of the element
[09:16:33] <shoky> SmokingSlim:  console.log( $('target element').length )
[09:17:45] <shoky> SmokingSlim:  also if you just wanna add event handlers on the new elements, you might wanna read about event delegation , so you can setup your event handlers on page load and forget about it
[09:18:38] <SmokingSlim> yea but those delegations are no longer supported as jQuery 1.7.2
[09:18:46] <shoky> SmokingSlim: sure they are
[09:18:51] <SmokingSlim> you're talking about live() right ?
[09:18:53] <shoky> SmokingSlim: you just have to read about how to d oit.
[09:19:11] <shoky> SmokingSlim: no, about on() if you read about how to do event delegation with it
[09:19:22] <shoky> just doing on('click', func)  is not using event delegation
[09:19:56] <shoky> more like:  $('#container').on('click', '.dynamicContent', function() { ... })
[09:21:09] <SmokingSlim> shoky thanks dude, will try it and see what happends ;)
[09:21:45] <real_eyes> live is depreciated as of 1.7
[09:24:11] <SmokingSlim> $('#content, #content2').on('click', '#filters', function() { console.log('wzuup')} yeah, that didnt console log out anythang
[09:24:32] <SmokingSlim> I think it has to be within the load() function
[09:24:42] <SmokingSlim> or the success parameters
[09:24:58] <shoky> are #content and #content2 part of the ajax load?
[09:25:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to enlarge the "toggle" area? The toggle now happens immediately when the user goes over the edge of the contaainer... Is it possible to only hide it on container + 100px or something?
[09:25:18] <jop008> what is a good way to check online status?
[09:25:38] <SmokingSlim> shoky, they are, but i tried to target $(document) also without luck
[09:27:06] <diverdude> hi, if i have <ul class="outer_list"><li><ul class="inner_list"><li></li></ul></li></ul> and i do .outer_list li{ color:red;} this rule will apply both to elements in the outer and the inner list. How do i make a rule that only applies to elements in the outer list?
[09:27:08] <wer0ckz> Hi Guys. help please - ui dialog show: fade and modal: true are not working on my second dialog. Please see my jsfiddel: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/GGLpT/
[09:28:06] <shoky> SmokingSlim: do you have more than one '#filters' element?
[09:28:29] <SmokingSlim> shoky, no good sir, it's an #id...
[09:33:31] <shoky> SmokingSlim: oh you said they are. you need to call .on()  on an element that already exists in the DOM
[09:34:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to keep an element permanently visible after a toggle?
[09:34:56] <SmokingSlim> ecky--ptang-zoob fadeIn ?
[09:35:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in css it has visibility hidden
[09:35:33] <SmokingSlim> why not set the css to display:none ?
[09:35:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and on hover, in css the visibility is set to visible
[09:35:41] <tharkun> Good $date I'm trying to runn flexigrid but it does fail by looking at an error console on Firefox's Firebug I get $.browser is undefined Where to go from here? I'm a neewby at jquery

[09:37:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok smokingslim, I changed that from display:none goes to display:block on hover
[09:37:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It should fade back out, except for 1 element...

[09:40:50] <FrameFever> I have a mouse delta position, how can I make a drag animation?
[09:40:56] <SmokingSlim> shoky, thanks dude but thats using the $.ajax and not the load() function tho
[09:41:04] <wer0ckz> <shoky> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/GGLpT/1/ <- so you need to close the dialog first?
[09:41:06] <shoky> SmokingSlim: it's the same thing.
[09:41:42] <shoky> wer0ckz: yes
[09:41:42] <SmokingSlim> shoky, yes i know, but that means I have to rewrite ALOT of code, while I think there is a more simple and elegant solution
[09:41:58] <shoky> SmokingSlim: you dont have to rewrite the .load man, i just couldnt use .load in jsfiddle
[09:41:59] <SmokingSlim> to my on() clicks
[09:42:07] <wer0ckz> thank you shoky
[09:42:52] <shoky> SmokingSlim: event delegation is usually the more elegant solution. but i dont really fully know what you're doing, so you're the best judge for now ;p
[09:43:15] <SmokingSlim> shoky thanks dude, will look in to that :) thanks for the time
[09:43:16] <shoky> (elegant and simpler solution)
[09:45:27] <FrameFever> does anybody know what I mean?
[09:45:54] <shoky> doubts
[09:46:57] <FrameFever> I want to drag an image with the mouse cursor, and when I release the mouse cursor the image should be slide some distance
[09:47:13] <FrameFever> depending on the mouse speed
[09:47:27] <mashlol> inertia
[09:47:29] <FrameFever> can anybode give me a hint how to implement this?
[09:48:08] <mashlol> keep track of the mouse speed while dragging (distance / time).  use this number to calculate the distance the image should slide after the mouse lets go.  animate the image to that location
[09:48:21] <mashlol> mouse velocity* as a vector
[09:49:39] <FrameFever> mashlol: can I use the mouse delta position?
[09:50:12] <mashlol> possibly if you calculate the time between events?  then you can get the instantaneous velocity.  might not be that accurate though
[09:50:56] <jop008> very hard to find browser is offline online x browser
[09:52:35] <JD-Robbs> Thanks shoky! I'll have a quick google and try it out :-)
[09:52:49] <SmokingSlim> shoky dude.... i've miss typed my selectors all along... LOL. dafuqé...
[09:53:51] <shoky> SmokingSlim: yehh
[09:58:01] <FrameFever> mashlol: ok when I have the mouse speed, how can I then create the animation?
[09:58:18] <recon_lap> bit lost here, http://pastie.org/7804979 , anyone know why the bind onSelect not working? the effect works and the datepicker slides in and out, but clicking dates does nothing?
[09:59:23] <Maffelu> has anyone ever had a problem with the delegate function in animate being fired multiple times?
[09:59:40] <wilkinsmc> is it ok to set $('*') as a variable?
[09:59:47] <JD-Robbs> Maffelu: maybe call stop before re-animating
[09:59:53] <wilkinsmc> trying to make code more efficient, but that seems like such a quick one to access neways
[10:00:09] <wilkinsmc> dunno if it'll help caching if i use it like 20 times
[10:00:25] <Maffelu> JD-Robbs, what do you mean?
[10:01:07] <JD-Robbs> Maffelu: http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[10:01:10] <JD-Robbs> i.e. stop()
[10:01:37] <JD-Robbs> Since multiple animations are usually a sign of animations queueing up
[10:01:55] <Maffelu> JD-Robbs, it's not the animation, it works well, it is the function afterwards. After the animation is finished it freezes for a while and then calls the animation multiple times
[10:02:04] <Maffelu> Ah, you mean it might animate even though it's not visible
[10:02:09] <mashlol> FrameFever: $("img").animate({top: y + "px", left: x + "px"});
[10:02:23] <mashlol> where x and y are the new location after sliding
[10:02:38] <mashlol> check http://api.jquery.com/animate/ for proper details
[10:04:33] <wilkinsmc> caching stuff doesn't appear to be improving speeds
[10:04:35] <jop008> no one a solution for check on of line?
[10:04:42] <wilkinsmc> i think these guys professing this stuff are just looking for hits on their site
[10:06:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Grr, I gave a submenu a position absolute and left:-150px in css, so it shows up directly under the main menu item... I added a click handler so the submenu shows correctly under the menu item when its clicked... but whenever I hover out of the submenu it shifts all the way to the left of the page at -150px relative to the document
[10:06:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why??!
[10:07:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> .mlogin			{ width:300px;left:-150px;  }  that's the submenu
[10:07:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shows at the right position when the main menu item is clicked, when I hover out of the submenu, it completely shifts to the left of the document!
[10:08:17] <FrameFever> mashlol: yeah I know this function, but what is the forumlar for the end position?
[10:08:34] <FrameFever> I have the current position, the mouse velocity
[10:08:43] <FrameFever> and thats it
[10:10:13] <recon_lap> ok, was missing a ) to close the .bind , but still not working as expected
[10:11:37] <mashlol> FrameFever: multiply the mouse velocity vector by a certain amount
[10:11:54] <mashlol> the amount is the amount of inertia you want, you'll have to experiment
[10:11:59] <mashlol> then add that to the current position
[10:15:14] <wilkinsmc> caching and linking don't appear to make my jquery run any faster in internet explorer
[10:15:18] <wilkinsmc> i would advice not to do it
[10:15:35] <wilkinsmc> from this all-encompasing and ever-relevant experience of mine
[10:17:23] <recon_lap> does JQuery datepicker have any events even?
[10:20:42] <jBryan> how can I preserve contents of bootstrap popover when I hide it?
[10:21:47] <wilkinsmc> omg
[10:22:07] <wilkinsmc> just made my jquery like 500% faster by replacing $('*') with $(this)
[10:23:40] <recon_lap> wilkinsmc: $('*') = whole dom i think
[10:24:30] <wilkinsmc> i didn't realize you could $(this) coordinates
[10:24:46] <wilkinsmc> so i was like, ok, so, EVERYTHING in these coordinates should be operated on
[10:25:09] <wilkinsmc> i found a plugin that is supposed to get around activex authorization
[10:25:19] <wilkinsmc> wonder if that's a bit shifty to google
[10:25:35] <wilkinsmc> it's messing up my formatting bad tho
[10:25:41] <wilkinsmc> activex authorization
[10:27:37] <real_eyes> jBryan:  var popoverContent = $("#bootstrap_popover_contents").html();
[10:28:37] <jBryan> real_eyes: whre do I put that? inside popover content?
[10:29:11] <real_eyes> jBryan: then --->  $("#bootstrap_popover_contents").html(popoverContent);
[10:32:50] <real_eyes> jBryan: just put it before you hide/remove it
[10:33:43] <jBryan> have you done this before?
[10:35:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Got a parent element with several child elements... I want to add a click handler to the parent element, but it fires also when click on any of the child elements... is it possible to bind the hanlder only to the root element?
[10:35:53] <jBryan> real_eyes:have you done this before?
[10:35:54] <sacho> .on('click', undefined) ?
[10:36:07] <sacho> .on('click', undefined, handler) rather
[10:36:45] <real_eyes> not with bootstrap popover, but the logic should still work
[10:36:49] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, aha, as per the documentation, undefined or null both work.
[10:36:55] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:36:55] <Guddu> Dear friends...I am using the datatables jquery plugin to create Paginated tables. The link to plugin is http://www.datatables.net/usage I have a table which gets populated dynamicaly (Ajax fetch) an that table is supposed to be paginated via this pkugin but that is not happening. Please tell me if I have to do something special for dunamically generated HTML elements?
[10:37:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sacho: I'm using on()
[10:37:34] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, good.
[10:37:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Like this: http://pastebin.com/1QdgjMHB
[10:37:40] <wilkinsmc> does jquery performance depend also on how fast a person's pc is?
[10:37:56] <real_eyes> wilkinsmc: yes
[10:37:59] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, well, use it the way I described, or read the documentation I linked you :)
[10:38:17] <deadlugosi> hi, I've got a project where tooltips on image map elements in a dialog all appear in the far upper left of the browser window.  Same image map not in the dialog the tootips work/position fine.  Can anyone point me at what might be jacking the position and/or how to fix it?
[10:38:40] <sacho> wilkinsmc, insomuch as the browser's performance depends on the machine it's running.
[10:39:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sacho: I already tried to stopPropagation :(
[10:39:35] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, I never said to use stopPropagation.
[10:39:48] <sacho> <sacho> .on('click', undefined, handler) rather
[10:39:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what's undefined then?
[10:40:18] <sacho> The delegate selector. You should read the documentation for specifics
[10:40:22] <real_eyes> wilkinsmc: jQuery is CLIENT side code, meaning the code is executed on the CLIENTS machine
[10:40:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right
[10:42:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event. If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element.
[10:42:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> But I already do it like this: $("#loginlink").on
[10:42:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> isn't that the selector already?
[10:45:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sacho: I don't get it, can you help me out?
[10:45:05] <mashlol> you can include a second selector ecky
[10:45:40] <Abbas5> how do i set a delay so if a user hovers away from my drop down menu, instead of hiding it, it shud wait like 400ms (and not hide the menu if the user hovers over the drop down again)
[10:45:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so the second argument is the child ID for example?
[10:45:52] <mashlol> yeah
[10:46:06] <mashlol> then the element doesn't have to exist when you bind the event
[10:46:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I tried, can you have a look at the code?
[10:46:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I know, but that's not what I'm trying to achieve... the element does exist
[10:46:45] <mashlol> then don't include a second selector
[10:46:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have structure like this <li><div>...</div></li> with a click on() bind to the li...
[10:47:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it fires also when I click on inside the div
[10:47:53] <mashlol> because the div is inside the li, and events bubble upwards afaik
[10:48:19] <real_eyes> well the <div >lives INSIDE the <li>
[10:48:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah so the event is handled!Ã¨
[10:48:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but i don't want it to be handled!
[10:49:26] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, hrm, just a sec.
[10:49:35] <sacho> I think I might have suffered a brain fart.
[10:50:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> lol
[10:51:09] <sacho> yeah.
[10:51:14] <mashlol> I think you can check event.target ecky--ptang-zoob
[10:51:19] <sacho> You may have to discard events in the handler
[10:51:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> for each child individually then?
[10:51:49] <sacho> check if event.target is event.currentTarget, for example
[10:51:55] <sacho> nah.
[10:52:17] <sacho> if (event.target === event.currentTarget) // the click originates from the element the handler was placed on, not one of its children
[10:53:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I do that, no events are caught
[10:53:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastebin.com/yfNMEgT2
[10:55:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> maybe I should wrap a span around the text inside li ?
[10:55:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and put the click handler on that span
[10:55:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is that ethical?
[10:57:21] <mashlol> http://jsfiddle.net/mzkfE/
[10:57:23] <mashlol> works for me
[10:57:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok let's try
[10:58:06] <Guddu> Dear friends...I am using the datatables jquery plugin to create Paginated tables. The link to plugin is http://www.datatables.net/usage I have a table which gets populated dynamicaly (Ajax fetch) an that table is supposed to be paginated via this pkugin but that is not happening. Please tell me if I have to do something special for dunamically generated HTML elements?
[11:00:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> mashlol: it doesn't get passed if (e.target === e.currentTarget) :(
[11:00:38] <mashlol> sure it does
[11:00:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> not in my case :(
[11:00:50] <mashlol> clicking on the grey works, clicking on the black doesn't
[11:00:52] <mashlol> what browser?
[11:00:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> chrome
[11:01:07] <mashlol> works fine for me
[11:01:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes it does in your code
[11:01:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> just not in mine
[11:01:37] <mashlol> oh
[11:01:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm doing exactly the same
[11:02:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'll make a fiddle of it
[11:02:32] <mashlol> must be something else wrong
[11:04:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Look: @122.
[11:04:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/mzkfE/3/
[11:06:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What's the difference with your code? I don't see it
[11:08:38] <mashlol> http://jsfiddle.net/mzkfE/9/
[11:08:42] <mashlol> does that work
[11:08:53] <mashlol> works for me
[11:09:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes it works in the fiddle
[11:09:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> let me try in the site
[11:09:52] <mashlol> the .toggle("class1", "class2") doesn't seem to work
[11:09:57] <mashlol> not sure if thats supposed to be valid query
[11:09:58] <mashlol> jquery*
[11:11:22] <wilkinsmc> just use add class/ remove class then?
[11:12:23] <wilkinsmc> IE seems to be reformatting my css when run outside of visual studio
[11:12:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it works here on your fiddle
[11:12:35] <wilkinsmc> i don't know if it's just a local file problem or what
[11:12:49] <wilkinsmc> whether it'll disappear once i get it on a server
[11:12:54] <wilkinsmc> just in the menu bar
[11:13:07] <rednovae> i want to dynamically generate a series of links that, when clicked, open a dialog with link-specific information
[11:13:32] <rednovae> this would be easy if i could do a onclick="somefunction('thetext')"
[11:14:38] <sacho> The best solution would be to place them in a container and put a handler on that container.
[11:15:25] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, you want .toggleClass('visible hidden')
[11:15:32] <sacho> ecky--ptang-zoob, although I think mashlol's solution is better.
[11:18:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[11:19:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok thx
[11:21:00] <real_eyes> rednovae: somthing along the lines of: <a href="#" id="link_one" onclick="alert($(this).attr('id'));">This is a link</a> ??
[11:22:16] <rednovae> real_eyes yes, but in a dialog capable of displaying multiple lines in a formatted box
[11:24:24] <cdkKk> Hi all, i have a question about jquery UI. With jquery ui i can style my forms? (inputs, radios, selects..)
[11:24:40] <real_eyes> rednovae: maybee use a absolutely positioned hidden div then $('#divID').html('whatever');
[11:24:47] <rednovae> i mean i'd be happy if i could get onclick="$('#someid').text('thetext');" to work
[11:26:43] <real_eyes> rednovae: what about that doesn't work?
[11:27:05] <rednovae> it isn't changing the contents of the div
[11:27:14] <rednovae> i don't get any errors either
[11:29:26] <mashlol> does `#someid` already exist? or do you have a script to create it maybe
[11:29:35] <rednovae> it already exists
[11:29:59] <rednovae> i can do an alert($('#someid')); and see that it finds the object
[11:30:52] <mashlol> http://jsfiddle.net/ra8Q3/
[11:30:56] <mashlol> works here
[11:31:16] <JosephSilber> rednovae, alert($('#anything')) will always alert an object. Try alert($('#someid').length);
[11:32:09] <rednovae> ohhhh a length of 0
[11:32:10] <rednovae> ok
[11:32:15] <rednovae> this is helpful
[11:33:19] <ctienrsg> Someone knowing how to write: if someone scrolls to 300 pixel away from bottom of browser window?
[11:34:30] <rednovae> hah ok got it
[11:35:42] <mashlol> ctienrsg: $(document).outerHeight() - $(window).innerHeight() - $(window).scrollTop() >= 300
[11:35:52] <mashlol> should work
[11:38:49] <ctienrsg> You are truly a skilled coder mashlol. I will try it and hope it tunes my slider.

[14:07:55] <BalthaTczar> Hello everyone... I've bought a book to learn jquery which is up to date with version 1.4 of jquery i realize thats a little dated at this time .. but would it still be reasonable to just get started with using/learning jquery at this time ?
[14:07:57] <Croves> Guys, how do I use .change() to force the selection on a option inside a <select> ?
[14:10:30] <ctienrsg> BalthaTczar: you better start today the never. I learnt html&css with books 5 years too old and it still worked well for the beginning
[14:11:15] <ctienrsg> How fast and good you learn depends on many factors, this shouldn't be the most important one
[14:11:40] <ctienrsg> BalthaTczar: For beginner, I strongly recomment http:try.jquery.com and codecademy.org
[14:11:54] <ctienrsg> Those are excellent tutorials for the beginner
[14:16:46] <ProLoser> hallo
[14:17:05] <ProLoser> what kind of object can i pass to triggerHandler?
[14:19:45] <BalthaTczar> ctienrsg: I'm already pretty knowledgeable when it comes to html/css and generally programming knowledge.. This book only cost me 8 euros which made decide to go with that :)
[14:19:54] <BalthaTczar> ctienrsg: Thanks very much for the links also.
[14:20:06] <ctienrsg> They are good for the beginner, trust me :)
[14:20:35] <ctienrsg> BalthaTczar: you code responsive, mobile first and such stuff already? Damn, I have so much to do in this section stillâ€¦
[14:20:55] <BalthaTczar> ctienrsg: No not that at all
[14:21:45] <BalthaTczar> ctienrsg: I need to get started with that as well
[14:23:23] <ctienrsg> I decided first to achieve excellence in 'old' technology which should enable me to make good use the benefits of 'new' technology then. But time's running and I'll have to hurry for there's so much news and competitionâ€¦
[14:39:12] <ProLoser> anyone here use triggerHandler?
[14:39:21] <ProLoser> i'm trying to figure out what i should be passing to the event
[14:39:30] <ProLoser> like what a fake event would be
[14:42:24] <FrameFever> mashlol: how do I calculate the mouse speed?
[14:43:57] <ProLoser> FrameFever: there are plugins that do that for you
[14:44:26] <FrameFever> I would like to avoid using a pluging, it can't be that many code
[14:44:45] <ProLoser> you'd have to measure velocity manually
[14:45:06] <tw2113> FrameFever, worst case, look at the code to see how they did it
[14:45:32] <FrameFever> tw2113: do you have a snippet?

[14:47:09] <FrameFever> tw2113: what pluging are you talking about?
[14:47:11] <zeita> rabbitface's cock continued to expand, massive veins bulged across the surface like snakes, winding their way up the gleaming tower of flesh.
[14:47:14] <zeita> "Holy shit! How much bigger is that thing gonna get?" asked froggytoad, his jaw slack at the sight of the towering cock.
[14:47:17] <zeita> "Fuck if I know," grunted setient, sweating with the effort of pumping yardena's gigantic tit.
[14:47:20] <zeita> rabbitface didn't seem to mind the massive new developments in his cock, he seemed to have finally lost himself in the pleasure of the world's biggest titfuck.
[14:47:23] <zeita> yardena, meanwhile, was more than enjoying herself. The combined thrill of setient and froggytoad stroking her colossal nipples and the growing warmth in her crotch was driving her insane with pleasure.
[14:47:27] <zeita> "Yes! Oh yessss!" she moaned, fondling the growing bulge in her own pants.
[14:47:30] <zeita> She'd never gotten around to wiping the cream off her gloves, by now her clit had received a double dose of the supercharged cream. The once tiny nubbin of flesh had expanded into a full blown sausage, and it was only a matter of time before she gave into the temptation to just whip it out and start jerking off like a dude. Her pussy, too, had puffed up to nearly twice its size and her swollen labia were putting a pleasurable pre
[14:47:36] <zeita> rabbitface began to groan and his yoga-ball sized nuts began to contract, hugging his shaft like a pair of bears snuggling up against an oak tree.
[14:47:39] <zeita> "I think he's getting close," panted setient, watching rabbitface's eyes as they rolled back in his head.
[14:47:42] <zeita> froggytoad nodded and the pair began to stroke faster, driving rabbitface inexorably toward climax.
[14:47:45] <zeita> yardena purred hungrily as she felt rabbitface's shaft grow hot and bulge in anticipation of orgasm. She reached up and grasped the trunk of his shaft, pulling it down with all her weight and inching backwards until the gargantuan cockhead was right in her face.
[14:47:49] <zeita> "What the hell are you doing?" grunted froggytoad. "This angle is really difficult."
[14:47:52] <zeita> "Just keep it up a little longer," yardena instructed. "He's close, I can feel it..."
[14:47:55] <zeita> She gazed into rabbitface's gaping cumslit. It was like looking down the barrel of an artillery piece.
[14:47:57] <tw2113> i dunno FrameFever, ProLoser said there are plugins for that. Find one and look at its code to see how it's done
[14:47:58] <zeita> rabbitface moaned again and his balls tightened further.
[14:48:00] <zeita> "Oh yeah, cum for me, baby," yardena licked her lips, gripping rabbitface's cockhead firmly behind the flared edges of the broad mushroom and opening her mouth wide.
[14:48:03] <zeita> "Don't tell me you're gonna try and swallow that load?" asked froggytoad, his eyes bugging in disbelief. "There's no way you could take it all!"
[14:48:06] <zeita> "I dunno, man," said setient, "she did chug like, two gallons of protein shake without taking a breath. I think she might be able to handle this."
[14:48:07] <tw2113> ping ajpiano danheberden
[14:48:09] <zeita> "There's no way I'm gonna pussy out on taking the world's largest cumshot," said yardena.
[14:48:12] <zeita> rabbitface grunted and his abs tightened as a visible bulge began to climb the twelve and a half foot pillar of his cock.
[14:48:16] <zeita> "Here we go!" yardena grinned and plunged her face into rabbitface's cockhead. His cumslit was actually larger than her mouth, so she stuck her whole face in and opened wide...
[14:48:18] <zeita> This is the part where yardena almost died.
[14:48:21] <zeita> rabbitface let out a terrific howl of pleasure and let loose with a blast of jizz that, for a moment, looked like an explosion of white.
[14:48:24] <zeita> Cum flooded into yardena's mouth, filling her cheeks and spraying out her nose. Her years of experience in sucking cock were the only thing that saved her; if she'd hesitated to swallow for only a split second, three gallons of spunk would have flooded into her lungs instead of her stomach.
[14:48:29] <zeita> The pressure was enough to knock her off her feet, she hit the wall behind her with enough force to crack the drywall, held momentarily in midair by a stream of jizz that would have shamed a fire hose.
[14:48:33] <zeita> setient and froggytoad, still gripping yardena's now eighteen inch nipples, were yanked off balance and flung to the ground as the wet splatter of semen cascaded off the wall and pattered all over them in heavy globs.
[14:53:04] <tw2113> that was interesting
[14:54:04] <Trical> I want to make a js object that can later be turned into a json object with this structure: http://pastebin.com/5M8tiWeM but how do I nest things in my js object?
[14:54:59] <Trical> this is what I have so far: http://i.imgur.com/3yRUnxX.png
[14:58:00] <gvo> Trical: You're on the right track.  Just keep going.
[14:59:08] <Trical> gvo, uhm it goes wrong when I try to put something in melding.auteru.naam
[14:59:19] <Trical> because auteur = undefined
[14:59:40] <gvo> start from the inside and work out.
[14:59:43] <Trical> should I make an object into an object or something(I don't really have much js experience, figuring this out on the go)
[15:00:41] <gvo> Build an object with the contents of auteru then assign it as auteru.
[15:01:06] <Trical> aight
[15:01:41] <jordotech> is there a minimum version of jquery needed to use jquery-ui tooltip?
[15:02:10] <simonowen> Hi, please can someone help if they have a min - http://jsfiddle.net/kEYKq/ - trying to get it, so, if you click an element, the className shows up in 'output'.
[15:02:50] <gvo> Trical: Give me a minute or two and I'll jsfiddle some sample code.
[15:03:24] <Trical> that would be nice gvo a minimalistic example should be enough :)
[15:06:37] <gvo> http://jsfiddle.net/Q9AbC/
[15:06:53] <gvo> Trical: Didn't try it, but you get the gist of it.
[15:07:46] <gvo> y is the thing you're going to jsonify.
[15:08:37] <Trical> yes
[15:08:41] <Trical> ty
[15:08:46] <gvo> np
[15:12:14] <gvo> what's this line do?  $(this).attr('class');
[15:12:46] <gvo> simonowen: ^^
[15:12:56] <simonowen> ?
[15:13:08] <simonowen> ah missed the link!
[15:15:00] <simonowen> sorry got confused... let's start again :p
[15:15:25] <simonowen> I'm trying to get the class attribute from the element clicked
[15:15:51] <simonowen> e.g. body has a class of 'selector'
[15:16:29] <simonowen> so the aim, is that if body is clicked, the class attribute is then written out at the top in the .output div
[15:16:34] <simonowen> that make sense?
[15:19:04] <danheberden> simonowen: so what method would you use to get an attribute of a dom node?
[15:19:40] <danheberden> and then a step further, what does that attribute turn into when the html gets parsed ?
[15:20:53] <simonowen> guessing the method is .attr() ?
[15:21:22] <danheberden> and after the html gets parsed, that "class" attr gets turned into a property of the dom node
[15:21:27] <danheberden> which is called "className"
[15:22:15] <danheberden> so you would first get the body as a jQuery object  `$('body')` and then get a property on that using the `.prop` method
[15:22:24] <danheberden> $('body').prop('className')
[15:22:55] <danheberden> if you're looking for a class in particular, you can `hasClass`, `is`, etc
[15:23:29] <danheberden> for body, though, you could also get that directly with `document.body.className`
[15:23:58] <danheberden> since $('body') makes a jQuery object using document.body, and .prop simply gets a property of that dom node
[15:24:04] <simonowen> thanks, will look into the .prop method, I'm not looking for a particular class, I'm looking to return the class name of the element that has been clicked
[15:24:17] <danheberden> of any element?
[15:24:49] <danheberden> that'd be more like $(document).on('click', function(event) { console.log( e.target.className ); });
[15:24:58] <danheberden> where e.target is the element that triggered the click event
[15:25:04] <simonowen> to start off with I was looking for that, then I'd want to confine it to anything including or within .rule-selector
[15:26:36] <simonowen> shouldn't that be: $(document).on('click', function(e) { console.log( e.target.className ); });
[15:26:58] <simonowen> otherwise e is not defined ?
[15:29:47] <simonowen> sorted it I think :)
[15:29:47] <simonowen> http://jsfiddle.net/kEYKq/1/
[15:31:48] <danheberden> simonowen: my apologies, i meant event.target; but yeah, you got the point
[15:32:27] <simonowen> danheberden: yup, didn't know you could do it like that, thanks for the help
[15:34:19] <Guest33116> How should I go about measuring the dimensions of an element with a box-shadow applied to it? .width() and .height() both don't seem to include the shadow.
[15:34:48] <danheberden> the shadow isn't part of the element, it's rendered after its creation
[15:35:24] <danheberden> i don't have any creative ideas, aside from getting the width height and the dropshadow offsets
[15:35:59] <mmiller_> the reason I need to measure the dimensions is that I'm including the box-shadowed element in an SVG foreignObject, and the browser won't show the element unless I set width/height on it.
[15:36:43] <mmiller_> is there a library/plugin that will abstract the measurement away?
[16:01:17] <fizz> anyone on who could help me with some ajax problems?
[16:07:04] <fizz> anyone on who could help me with some ajax problems?
[16:09:46] <JosephSilber> fizz: maybe. What is it?
[16:10:12] <fizz> basically can't get the correct json response from a php file
[16:10:58] <JosephSilber> Does it work correctly without AJAX (if you just enter the URL directly in the browser)?
[16:11:30] <fizz> not sure how i'd test that because i use the response to dynamically update js vars and a div
[16:11:35] <fizz> heres the php http://pastebin.com/chPWDaTj
[16:11:44] <fizz> i've just set arbitrary vars to even see if the js is receiving an array
[16:12:12] <fizz> this is the js : http://pastebin.com/Fe5ZHBf4
[16:13:04] <JosephSilber> Are you sure the server is expecting a GET, not a POST? try using $.post() instead of $.get()
[16:13:10] <fizz> i have
[16:13:11] <fizz> nothing changes
[16:13:20] <fizz> the input array contains both GET and POST requests anyway
[16:14:03] <JosephSilber> I have no idea what input is. How come it's not $input?
[16:15:13] <fizz> it is i accidentally cut that part off i think when i pasted
[16:15:36] <fizz> $input is an associatvie array containing all get and post requests
[16:15:50] <JosephSilber> fizz: so again, what happens when you visit that URL directly from the browser?
[16:16:49] <fizz> nothing joseph
[16:17:15] <JosephSilber> Then the problem is server side, and has nothing to do with AJAX
[16:18:40] <fizz> hmm
[16:19:53] <fizz> yep you're right, hah i fixed it!
[16:19:55] <fizz> thanks a bunch
[16:21:21] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/GGLpT/12/  - the 2nd back button is not erasing the text area. first 'back' button is working
[16:30:51] <fizz> well nevermind i'm getting a problem with it again
[16:31:08] <wer0ckz> help please
[16:31:08] <fizz> it's properly echoing out the data i want if i visit the ajax.php file directly
[16:31:13] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/GGLpT/12/  - the 2nd back button is not erasing the text area. first 'back' button is working
[16:31:13] <fizz> but it won't return to the js file
[16:34:26] <fizz> If you're still there JosephSilber
[16:38:17] <fizz> or anyone that could help me with some AJAX problems
[16:39:26] <sunbeam> if i would like to post some data to a link, what can i best use? not $.post because i am not posting a form
[16:39:29] <sunbeam> $.ajax?
[16:39:51] <fizz> $.get or $.post
[16:40:10] <fizz> get would be url.com/file.php?var=something
[16:40:26] <fizz> .get and .post are just simplified versions of .ajax
[16:43:06] <mashlol> using $.post has nothing to do with forms fizz
[16:43:14] <mashlol> POST is just a request type
[16:43:27] <mashlol> POST/GET/PUT/DEL
[16:43:57] <fizz> indeed
[16:44:41] <mashlol> sumbeam rather* not fizz :p
[16:45:03] <fizz> mash you think you could help me with an ajax problem?
[16:45:18] <mashlol> possibly
[16:45:52] <fizz> alright the php file isn't the problem
[16:45:55] <sunbeam> ok
[16:45:58] <sunbeam> so i should use $.post
[16:46:10] <mashlol> if you want to send a post request, $.post seems easiest
[16:46:23] <sunbeam> ok
[16:46:29] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/GGLpT/12/  - the 2nd back button is not erasing the text area. first 'back' button is working - im using
[16:46:35] <sunbeam> this request will need to give me back a download link
[16:46:38] <sunbeam> is that possible?
[16:46:38] <wer0ckz> window.TextAreaOldValue = txt.val(); - multiple 'back' button not working properly.
[16:46:56] <mashlol> the request can return data, yes
[16:47:04] <mashlol> so a string being a link, sure
[16:47:08] <fizz> mash here's the js file http://pastebin.com/3z3EqGxa
[16:47:19] <fizz> i've tried using .get and .post before this
[16:47:26] <fizz> but it just won't return the json array
[16:48:29] <mashlol> looks okay to me.  possibly cross-domain issue?
[16:48:40] <fizz> http://pastebin.com/7B67jkaz
[16:48:45] <fizz> i have no idea why it won't work
[16:48:48] <fizz> it's all on localhost right now
[16:48:58] <fizz> if i visit the php file directly it correctly outputs the json array
[16:49:52] <mashlol> try appending the data in the url
[16:49:53] <mashlol> instead of in the {}
[16:50:20] <JosephSilber> fizz, you're using getJSON, which makes a GET request
[16:50:38] <mashlol> browser is also a get request
[16:50:53] <fizz> yeah i'm aware
[16:51:00] <fizz> but i'm using a get ajax request
[16:51:04] <fizz> so why won't it return the data
[16:51:27] <JosephSilber> What are you tring to do with the data in your success callback?
[16:51:48] <fizz> append it to a textarea
[16:52:17] <mashlol> does the success callback get called?
[16:52:30] <fizz> doesn't appear to
[16:52:51] <mashlol> try to add a failure callback and see the error
[16:53:12] <JosephSilber> The code you posted doesn't do that.
[16:53:42] <fizz> doesn't do what
[16:54:53] <JosephSilber> Doesn't show how you're appending it to the textarea
[16:55:37] <fizz> No it doesn't but i just discovered that the query is failing
[16:56:45] <fizz> .fail(function(e) {alert('FAILED: '+e)}); gives me FAILED: Object object
[16:57:03] <fizz> or [object Object] rather
[16:57:14] <mashlol> do console.log(e)
[16:59:30] <fizz> hmm
[17:00:00] <fizz> gives me this: http://pastebin.com/GRbr3N0e
[17:00:29] <fizz> although before that it shows it's sending the correct GET request
[17:01:20] <mashlol> `responseText:"pid: 1{\"username\":\"fizz\",\"dateline\":\"1367725225\"}`
[17:01:35] <mashlol> looks like invalid json?
[17:03:20] <fizz> how would that be occurring? all it does is echo json_encoded array
[17:03:55] <mashlol> what text do you see in your browser when you visit it
[17:04:47] <MobCat> i put dragenter and dragleave on document and when i drag something into my website they both fire at the same time
[17:04:56] <MobCat> anyone familiar with that?
[17:06:34] <fizz> {"username":"fizz","dateline":"1367726978"
[17:06:40] <fizz> }
[17:08:18] <mashlol> actually go to your site with the $.ajax request and in chrome dev tools go to the network tab and check the response there
[17:08:39] <fizz> oh actually hango n it's giving me the right stuff
[17:09:17] <sunbeam> btw, why use the shorthand $.post instead of $.ajax
[17:09:22] <sunbeam> i mean, why is it recommended?
[17:09:30] <Z3R0> just less to code...
[17:09:36] <fizz> it does a lot of the work for you sunbeam, less code
[17:09:43] <Z3R0> $.post still uses $.ajax I think
[17:09:51] <fizz> @mash how would i access the success() vars outside thes uccess function?
[17:09:52] <sunbeam> Z3R0: yes, thats why i am asking
[17:10:04] <Z3R0> again, it's jst less codd
[17:10:06] <Z3R0> code*
[17:10:09] <fizz> http://pastebin.com/EFF5k2hA
[17:10:23] <JosephSilber> $.get and $.post directly call $.ajax
[17:10:23] <JosephSilber> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.post
[17:10:34] <Z3R0> yep, they just use less args'
[17:10:52] <mashlol> so you're gonna use the fail method to get the data?  seems like playing with fire a bit.
[17:11:07] <JosephSilber> fizz, you're trying to use the data returned asynchronously outside of the success handler...
[17:11:14] <fizz> nope the success is working now
[17:11:28] <mashlol> oh, why not just move the reply stuff into the success callback then?
[17:11:48] <JosephSilber> You'll have to move $("#message").append(reply); into your callback
[17:12:17] <fizz> yeah i just realiazed that thanks
[17:12:20] <fizz> working finally jesus
[17:12:40] <mashlol> what was wrong originally fizz
[17:13:33] <fizz> the first time i wasn't hooking into the php file properly
[17:13:39] <fizz> so the json wasn't even getting processed/echoed
[17:13:56] <fizz> the second time i think i was echoing out a statement on accident and it was picking that up as an improper json array
[17:14:26] <mashlol> glad you fixed it
[17:15:56] <fizz> same hah, although now it's appendign to the textarea twice...
[17:22:04] <poop202> Not working on GC - http://pastebin.com/uXwRwqcm - help please?
[17:25:20] <JosephSilber> poop202, use style['-webkit-filter']
[17:26:14] <blackmad> hey all, I'm trying to get a jqueryui button to work, and it's just â€¦ not â€¦ when I do $("<a>").button() in the console, I get back an element that looks like [<a></a>] -- no button decoration
[17:26:43] <blackmad> I'm including "http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css" /> and   <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[17:29:39] <poop202> JosephSilber , thanks, but it still won't work onmouseout
[17:30:40] <JosephSilber> poop202, pass the change functions instead of calling them $('#pic').fadeTo('slow', 0.5, change) $('#pic').fadeTo('slow', 0.5, changeb)
[17:30:49] <JosephSilber> so change, not change()
[17:32:38] <poop202> okay..
[17:32:38] <poop202> hm..
[17:34:37] <poop202> woot thanks! it's working now!
[17:56:06] <sunbeam> what type of data should i send with $.post?
[17:56:31] <sunbeam> I am trying to send someArray[1] = $("tr.class");
[17:56:40] <sunbeam> should i convert it to some other type ?
[17:56:46] <sunbeam> because in php i dont see this data
[17:57:42] <hillct> Good evening all. I'm trying to do some trivial tempting using query, where I have a DOM node, I've cloned (a form with a few elements needing populating) and am trying to populate input and text area elements using .val() but can't seem to get the syntax right for updating my dom node clone 'dynode' for example
[17:57:58] <hillct> Any guidance, or pointer to docs/examples
[18:09:33] <lenswipee> howdy all!
[18:33:16] <relipse>  How can i get similar arrows on right and left as on http://www.usatoday.com/life/
[18:35:34] <madprops> does blur triggers before the other element is focused?
[18:36:01] <relipse> can you show me by editing this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/k_rma/VmSX4/ to add arrows like on  http://www.usatoday.com/life/ (right and left sides)
[19:01:37] <Gazpacho> relipse: so you want someone to turn that into a next card / previous card animation and you don't even have next and previous cards to go to
[19:01:47] <Gazpacho> sure someone will get right on that
[19:59:38] <Sadtaco> How do I find how far down an element is from the top of a scrollable div?
[19:59:48] <Sadtaco> when its parent is a scrollable div
[19:59:55] <Sadtaco> As I want to set the scrollTop to that
[20:03:27] <Sadtaco> position i guess
[20:10:43] <linuxviewer> I have an ajax page that passes a form to 'submit.php'.  The 'submit.php' page checks the data and inputs it into the database.  I then want it to send back to the javascript success function something like if there was a particular error or datatype.  What is the best way of transferring data from php to javascript?  I am reading up on json_encode but do not know how to call it on the javascript
[20:10:43] <linuxviewer> ajax success function side.  Any suggestions?
[20:11:46] <Mage> you'd setup your ajax request to be a json response type
[20:11:51] <Mage> and in php you'd have something like
[20:11:57] <JosephSilber> The JSON that you echo with json_encode will be passed into your success callback
[20:12:07] <Mage> $out = array('success' => true); echo json_encode($out);
[20:12:48] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: you echo json_encode($php_data); and then deal with it in the success function
[20:13:19] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: success: function(data) {}
[20:13:29] <linuxviewer> Mage - The current ajax type is 'post' since it is submiting form data to submit.php to put into the database.  What I am trying to do is get it to send something back to jquery if there is an error connecting to database (like wrong username/password as an example) so that the success : function(data) changes the page to an error page rather than a success page.
[20:13:34] <Sadtaco> Is there a way to force focus a scrollable div so the up and down arrows will scroll it?
[20:14:12] <Mage> linuxviewer: yeah, echo things out
[20:14:16] <Mage> make sure the 'type' is json
[20:14:19] <linuxviewer> lenswipee - that is what i'm trying to do.  json_encode is successful going to the success function (i have tested it using console.log) but then I want to use an if/then conditional statement in the success function to give appropriate changes to page of Success or Failure
[20:15:10] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: then do that.
[20:16:53] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: btw you handle errors in error: function(){}
[20:18:36] <linuxviewer> lenswipee - but using error: function, from my understanding, isn't appropriate for php/mysql errors (such as can't connect to database).
[20:19:12] <linuxviewer> lensipee - I am trying to pass an alert message to the user saying like "success!" while also passing the json_encode array that I have success=>true
[20:19:54] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: what's the php array?
[20:20:03] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: Sorry, what's in the php array?
[20:20:06] <linuxviewer> lensipee = http://pastebin.com/rDM43Uhd
[20:20:42] <linuxviewer> If you look at that pastebin, that is how i am attempting to pass it to jquery.  However, I'm not sure exactly how to properly utilize it in the jquery
[20:21:21] <JosephSilber> linuxviewer, echo json_encode(array('success'=>true,'message'=>'Thank you for the submission, we will process your application shortly.'));
[20:21:55] <linuxviewer> JosephSilber = hahahahaha, that makes so much more sense. :)  Then how do i call it from the jquery side in the success function?
[20:23:17] <JosephSilber> linuxviewer,  it'll be passed into your success callback success: function (data) { /* use data.success & data.message */ }
[20:24:26] <linuxviewer> do i have to do data.success.name  or data.success.value?
[20:25:12] <linuxviewer> because when I did it the console for either data.success and data.message said undefined
[20:26:03] <lenswipee> try data['success']
[20:26:28] <lenswipee> failing that data[success]
[20:26:38] <lenswipee> failing that data[0]
[20:26:46] <lenswipee> failing that data['0']
[20:29:09] <Gazpacho> failing that, jump out a window
[20:29:42] <linuxviewer> lenswipee = when doing data['0'] it produces "n" and '1' is "u" and when I keep going it spells out null  (data[0 - 4])
[20:32:19] <lenswipee> failing that try data{0}
[20:32:30] <lenswipee> failing that try data {'0'}
[20:32:46] <lenswipee> failing that try data{'success'}
[20:32:49] <linuxviewer> i'm confused.  I have success : function(data) { alert(data);  .......   that reflects the {"success":true, "message":"string message goes here"}.  But when I try to do alert(data.message) it does NOT pull the message data.  It only says undefined
[20:33:54] <JosephSilber> Did you set the type to JSON?
[20:34:17] <linuxviewer> yes   type : 'json',
[20:34:29] <JosephSilber> Are you setting the JSON header?
[20:34:40] <linuxviewer> that i'm not sure of.  can you explain?
[20:34:43] <JosephSilber> header('Content-type: application/json');
[20:34:52] <JosephSilber> Before you echo the json_encode
[20:34:56] <linuxviewer> let me try
[20:34:59] <linuxviewer> because it is not there
[20:35:22] <relipse> tabBugNotes = new SBETabs({container: $('#divBugNoteTabs').get(0), OnSelect: OnBugNoteTabSelect}); <-- what is the "this" keyword inside of OnBugNoteTabSelect function ?
[20:35:50] <linuxviewer> JosephSilber = that worked!  Thanks lenswipee and JosephSilber!
[20:36:11] <lenswipee> linuxviewer: which one worked?
[20:36:15] <lenswipee> :)
[20:36:16] <linuxviewer> adding header
[20:36:23] <linuxviewer> then i could call by data.message
[20:36:24] <linuxviewer> data.error
[20:36:31] <lenswipee> lol ok
[20:36:35] <linuxviewer> thanks :)
[20:56:22] <wilkinsmc> is there any way to run some jquery code only for a specific browser?
[20:56:51] <Sadtaco> modernizer
[20:59:06] <wilkinsmc> ah, found a way to only rotate for firefox
[20:59:07] <wilkinsmc> through css
[20:59:19] <wilkinsmc> i figure that if someone is using firefox they're probably using the latest version neway
[20:59:25] <wilkinsmc> cuz it pounds you over the head to do so
[20:59:27] <wilkinsmc> like hitler
[20:59:29] <Sadtaco> How do I stop the default behavior of pageup/down?
[20:59:48] <wilkinsmc> .unbind
[21:00:02] <Sadtaco> what
[21:00:13] <wilkinsmc> nvrmind
[21:00:30] <wilkinsmc> isn't there a prevent default function in jquery?
[21:12:33] <Sadtaco> Oh right
[21:12:36] <Sadtaco> that's whati wanted rfl
[21:14:33] <Sadtaco> That doens't do it
[21:15:34] <aid_> if i do form = $('form').attr('id');  is the same than doing  form = $('#formProjectAdd');   ??
[21:16:32] <Gazpacho> aaaaahhhh stupid w3schools
[21:19:14] <Sadtaco> How do I disable to default behavior of pageUp on a scrollable div?
[21:26:24] <wilkinsmc> is there a way to call in css after a javascript docload in a css document or in the html?
[21:31:21] <wilkinsmc> nvrmind, found something betta
[21:31:24] <wilkinsmc> froshetta cheese
[21:37:58] <wilkinsmc> avg is really starting to piss me off
[21:38:00] <wilkinsmc> installing toolbars
[21:38:03] <wilkinsmc> and bein a bitch
[21:42:17] <aid_> wilkinsmc: punch it up
[21:42:52] <wilkinsmc> YES
[21:42:59] <wilkinsmc> FIXED MOZilla BEIN A BITCH
[21:43:12] <wilkinsmc> sadtaco: you can separate out browsers with jquery
[21:43:18] <wilkinsmc> why you saying use modernizer?
[21:43:27] <Sadtaco> I thought they were removing lots of that
[21:44:15] <wilkinsmc> it doesn't appear to select chrome outright
[21:44:29] <wilkinsmc> but selecting and not selecting firefox and IE works great
[21:47:05] <Dantman> Agh... friggin cops... I got ran over by a police car.
[21:48:13] <aid_> drugs?
[21:48:21] <Dantman> Saints Row 2
[21:49:01] <Dantman> *facepalm* wrong channel to
[21:51:55] <paulvd> i am using the following plugin to make a scrollable area, http://www.convergent-evolution.co.uk/resources/jquery-plugins/scrolling-carousel/ if you over the mouse over "1" you will see it moves to "6" or loops, but i tried this same thing on a page, it doesn;t go back http://pza.com.au/
[22:16:26] <wilkinsmc> can't seem to make the mouse cursor turn into a pointer for all of the coordinates in the selector when i reference $(this) inside of it, only $('*'), but $('*') is very slow
[22:16:29] <wilkinsmc> any alternatives?
[22:22:03] <Cork> wilkinsmc: set it in the css file
[22:22:12] <Cork> and control it through a class
[22:23:17] <wilkinsmc> i can add coordinates to a class?
[22:23:26] <Cork> that way you only have to set it for body and those selectors that explicitly set tge cursor
[22:23:31] <Cork> no
[22:23:33] <wilkinsmc> because it's inside of a if (x > 10 && y < 10) sorta thing
[22:23:43] <Cork> why?
[22:23:54] <wilkinsmc> because the animations break hover detection
[22:24:19] <tw2113> Cork, my online friend...it feels like it's been hours since i last saw you
[22:24:22] <aid_> anybody knows why im not getting form = $('form').attr('id'); in this example  http://jsfiddle.net/ua4kZ/20/
[22:24:28] <Cork> tw2113: it's been days
[22:24:40] <tw2113> where has my mind been
[22:24:46] <tw2113> it must be hanging out with Doc Brown again
[22:24:49] <tw2113> that crazy guy
[22:25:33] <Cork> aid_: WFM http://jsfiddle.net/ua4kZ/21/
[22:26:06] <aid_> Cork:  ?
[22:26:10] <rosieres> can somebody tell me why variable is NaN ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/9eGG9/
[22:26:13] <Cork> wilkinsmc: animation shouldn't affect hover as long as you bind the hover on an element that isn't leaving the mouse cursor
[22:26:36] <Cork> aid_: wfm == Works For Me
[22:27:00] <Cork> rosieres: function isn't a number
[22:27:29] <Cork> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/9eGG9/1/
[22:27:50] <aid_> Cork:  the append of the hidden field is not working
[22:28:01] <aid_> Cork:  sorry the text field
[22:28:05] <Cork> aid_: well that isn't what you asked :)
[22:28:11] <rosieres> Cork: ouch ! Thanks
[22:28:34] <aid_> Cork:  when i do $('<input type="text" id="id_employee[]"  name="id_employee[]" value="' + ui.item.value + '"/>').appendTo(form);
[22:28:44] <Cork> rosieres: you're appending to a textstring
[22:28:48] <Cork> that won't work
[22:29:02] <Cork> aid_: http://jsfiddle.net/ua4kZ/22/
[22:29:21] <wilkinsmc> cork: do you think caching $('*') would work?
[22:29:27] <wilkinsmc> to speed up things, i maen
[22:29:28] <Cork> rosieres: sorry wrong nick
[22:29:30] <wilkinsmc> mean*
[22:29:35] <Cork> aid_: you're appending to a textstring
[22:29:47] <tw2113> ouch, that selector makes me cringe wilkinsmc
[22:29:50] <Cork> wilkinsmc: no
[22:30:04] <aid_> Cork:  but why it doesnt work with the id attr?
[22:30:26] <Cork> wilkinsmc: if you need to just handle mouse positions use $(document).on('mouseover', function(event) {})
[22:30:49] <Cork> aid_: $('f-fix') isn't a valid element
[22:31:20] <aid_> what would be a valid element then
[22:31:20] <wilkinsmc> ya, but the thing is i have an area of the animation i don't want to trigger hover
[22:31:38] <Cork> aid_: you have an id but you're selecting on it as if it was an element
[22:31:40] <wilkinsmc> but if mouseover overrides that, then shiiiiit
[22:31:46] <wilkinsmc> i mean, if it sees through it
[22:32:00] <aid_> i see
[22:32:05] <Cork> wilkinsmc: mouseover on document should trigger what ever you do
[22:32:24] <Cork> so you would have to grab the position and exclude the area for the animation
[22:32:43] <Cork> i don't see why you need to overdo it like this; but if you're set to do it, it can be done
[22:33:04] <wilkinsmc> well, i have a menu with an arrow animation over the top
[22:33:08] <wilkinsmc> i was trying to use on hover
[22:33:12] <wilkinsmc> but if something can see through the arrow
[22:33:15] <wilkinsmc> then i can just use that
[22:33:23] <wilkinsmc> but hover doesn't
[22:33:30] <wilkinsmc> it gets blocked by the massive arrow
[22:34:12] <Cork> wilkinsmc: so you have gaps, then you can use a wrapping element to cover that gap
[22:34:24] <Cork> or you can check what element you move between and grab it that way
[22:34:47] <wilkinsmc> ah ya, i should have definitely done a div
[22:34:50] <wilkinsmc> thought about that earlier at work
[22:35:04] <wilkinsmc> but it can't be that much more efficient than coordinates if i already have the coordinate work done
[22:35:33] <wilkinsmc> well, i guess it might if i don't have to use $('*'), but eh
[22:35:36] <wilkinsmc> next project perhaps
[22:35:45] <Cork> wilkinsmc: you will have to have something that triggers everytime the mouse is moved on the page
[22:35:53] <Cork> wilkinsmc: ...
[22:35:58] <Cork> docuemnt!
[22:36:00] <Cork> not *
[22:36:38] <tw2113> document
[22:36:45] <tw2113> typo fixed that for you Cork
[22:36:50] <Cork> there is absolutely no reason what so ever to bind eventlisteners to every element on the page
[22:36:57] <tw2113> torture
[22:37:02] <Cork> none
[22:37:08] <tw2113> sadism
[22:37:09] <Cork> N-O-N-E...
[22:37:17] <tw2113> the devil's work
[22:37:34] <tw2113> i'm done
[22:39:08] <wilkinsmc> cork:
[22:39:29] <wilkinsmc> $(document).mousemove
[22:39:34] <wilkinsmc> is what i have now to check coordinates
[22:41:08] <Cork> wilkinsmc: ya, that should be what you need
[22:41:50] <wilkinsmc> i wonder i caching $('*') will help at all with speed
[22:41:57] <wilkinsmc> i'm guessing prolly
[22:42:01] <Cork> why do you need *
[22:42:04] <Cork> i don't get it
[22:42:14] <wilkinsmc> to make the mouse change to a pointer
[22:42:25] <Cork> just set a class on the body
[22:42:34] <Cork> and use you're css file
[22:42:47] <wilkinsmc> ah, good idea
[22:42:49] <wilkinsmc> nyce
[22:42:52] <Cork> ....
[22:43:04] <Cork> it would be nice if you read the responses to you're own questions...
[22:43:05] <wilkinsmc> haha, i was thinking, "but, i can't put classes on coordinates"
[22:43:21] <tw2113> i have to agree with Cork
[22:43:24] <wilkinsmc> i got like no sleep and worked for ten hours
[22:43:31] <wilkinsmc> but i appreciate teh help
[22:43:31] <tw2113> why would anyone need to use $('*') for anything
[22:43:58] <Cork> there are situations, but.. that is extremely rare
[22:44:03] <Cork> ex $('*').off()
[22:44:14] <Cork> of you want to kill every event listener on the page
[22:44:23] <tw2113> mass suicide
[22:44:25] <tw2113> gotcha
[22:44:41] <tw2113> i'm morbid tonight o.O
[22:44:49] <Cork> heh
[22:45:36] <wilkinsmc> the only digital death that truly pains me is dead pixels
[22:45:47] <tw2113> you're a designer aren't you
[22:45:47] <wilkinsmc> and when my digimon died when i was fifteen
[22:46:15] <wilkinsmc> just designing for my business site for the first time (if you're talking to me)
[22:46:37] <wilkinsmc> but i've messed with jquery in the past just to learn it for no reason
[22:46:39] <tw2113> devs only care about pixels if they're constantly repainting them :D
[22:47:01] <wilkinsmc> I'm an OCD gamer, so dead pixels kill me
[23:07:03] <wilkinsmc> soi guess it's faster in all cases to add a class instead of changing css properties?
[23:08:00] <Cork> wilkinsmc: it makes it cleaner
[23:08:21] <Cork> and if you want to affect child elements then definitely
[23:09:45] <jop008> I have this $("#online_status").append("xxOnline"); my content is not updated
[23:09:57] <jop008> I tired .html as well
[23:10:13] <wilkinsmc> ty
[23:10:14] <jop008> <div id='onlne_status'
[23:10:28] <Cork> jop008:  console.log($("#online_status").length)
[23:11:03] <Cork> also if that isn't 0 try  $('[id="online_status"]').length
[23:12:42] <jop008> length = 0
[23:12:50] <Cork> so the id isn't in the page
[23:13:03] <Cork> that's why it isn't updating
[23:13:28] <jop008> but I have this  <div id='#online_status'>yxxxOnline/Offline status</div>
[23:13:38] <Cork> id='#online_status' <--
[23:13:52] <Cork> that would be $('##online_status')
[23:13:56] <jop008> Okay stupid
[23:21:27] <develkar> hello all, I am trying to make a slideshow responsive with the help of jquery, for that I make all images to have width and height
[23:21:32] <develkar> with the code http://pastie.org/7807146
[23:21:49] <develkar> this sets the attributes correctly
[23:21:57] <wilkinsmc> watch the marquee video on lynda if you don't get a quick fix
[23:22:04] <wilkinsmc> marquee jquery
[23:23:02] <develkar> but after sometime the height of image is returned as 0
[23:24:24] <develkar> the output of console.log is 0. my recent code is here : http://pastie.org/7807152
[23:25:20] <Cork> develkar: if the image hasn't rendered yet the img tag will have 0 height
[23:25:34] <relipse> can someone help me get a div and image right aligned and vertically centered? go to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ > org: test_test_test user: admin pw: testtest --> click "Add Bug" on that dialog there is supposed to be a tall div aligned to the right with an <img> in the center, and when you click it, it changes tabs
[23:25:50] <Cork> you might have to wait for the load event to trigger on the img tag before you do you're calculations
[23:27:39] <develkar> Cork, thank you that was surely helpful. Only 3 images are being loaded on the slideshow which means that the code is applicable to only those images
[23:28:06] <develkar> how can I make sure I apply this code to all images?
[23:28:39] <Cork> you most likely have to apply it as it's added
[23:29:01] <Cork> there isn't a way to watch the page for changes, so you can't do it that way
[23:31:37] <develkar> Cork, thank you. I will try for some more time, and will get back here if I get stuck anywhere. I appreciate your willingness to help :)
[23:33:31] <tw2113> Cork deserves commission
[23:42:30] <domino14_> i created an img like $("<img/>, {"src": url});
[23:44:05] <domino14_> how does it strip the URL of bad stuff? for example if i make the URL 'x" onerror=prompt(1);"' it will not prompt, but if i just do $(blah).append('<img src="' + url + '"/>') it injects the script
[23:44:23] <domino14_> i can't find where in the code it sanitizes the el
[23:49:14] <leeyo> hi room
[23:49:20] <leeyo> $('room').hi();
[23:49:27] <leeyo> $('.room').hi();
[23:49:54] <domino14_> are you using the hi plugin?
[23:50:52] <leeyo> yes I created it just today
[23:52:07] <domino14_> how do i escape $("<img/>", src: url} where url is user-inputted?
[23:52:20] <domino14_> is that already vulnerable to xss? can someone show me a proof of concept
[23:52:22] <domino14_> for url
[23:53:44] <Cork> domino14_: the volnerability is in the possibility to post javascript: url's
[23:54:03] <domino14_> oh
[23:54:20] <Cork> xss is that another site through some means can run js on you're page
[23:54:32] <Cork> ... *your page
[23:55:06] <Cork> someone looking for a new keyboard? http://www.designhead.net/cdimino/typewriters4.html
[23:55:07] <Cork> :D
[23:55:07] <domino14_> i tried a url of javascript:alert('hi'); and it doesn't pop up
[23:58:42] <leeyo> how come?
[23:58:47] <leeyo> http://jsbin.com/ifamej/1/
[23:59:20] <Cork> how come what?
[23:59:50] <domino14_> i'm trying to see if $("<img/>", {src: url}) is xss-vulnerable
[23:59:52] <leeyo> i mean how come nothing popped out of the screen?
[23:59:55] <domino14_> if 'url' is user-provided
[23:59:59] <leeyo> oh i see
