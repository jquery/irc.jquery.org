[00:13:00] <SuperPhly> Hey guys, what does a line of js that starts with a "(" mean?
[00:13:16] <SuperPhly> is it a macro for after page load?
[01:36:00] <platinoid> I am trying to add a row to a form by button click, for some reason it wont run. here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/HCder/
[01:39:10] <platinoid> anyone?
[01:41:34] <samuel02> platinoid: where's the js?
[01:46:03] <platinoid> samuel02:sorry, hadnt updated. check now
[01:46:22] <platinoid> http://jsfiddle.net/HCder/1/
[01:48:57] <samuel02> platinoid: a good ideas is usually to start by including jquery, next step; write valid html. http://jsfiddle.net/HCder/2/
[01:49:55] <greg5green> looks pretty valid to me
[01:49:58] <samuel02> platinoid: now, if you want to be able to keep adding forms you will have to use other selectors and bind new click events to the new buttons
[01:50:04] <greg5green> but thats neither here nor there
[01:51:38] <samuel02> greg5green, you're right, technically it isn't invalid. I just prefer self closing tags when there's not a separate closing tag
[01:51:45] <samuel02> i.e. for the inputs
[01:51:57] <greg5green> yeah, i like xhtml too :)
[01:58:44] <greg5green> platinoid, i'd probably assign a classname to the button and use event delegation
[01:58:49] <greg5green> like
[01:59:10] <greg5green> $('form').on('click', '.addMoreFieldsets', function() { })
[02:00:15] <greg5green> id show you the example i started to do, but for some reason .append will only append once
[02:00:22] <greg5green> and i dont feel like debugging it
[02:00:49] <platinoid> ok I have dynamic rows working now
[02:01:00] <platinoid> add button generates the fields
[02:01:20] <platinoid> now the problem is that I have a jquery and javascript running on one of the select fields
[02:01:41] <platinoid> when I change it say for the first row, then all the new generated rows get affected too
[02:02:01] <platinoid> can I fix this?
[02:02:53] <greg5green> yes
[02:06:17] <spanglesontoast> anyone know how to do notifications with long polling :S ?
[02:10:09] <motox> Is there a reason that hover no longer works with .delegate() in jquery 2.x?  I just noticed some hover effects weren't working.  I went back to 1.8.3 and it works fine again          $('#someDiv ul').delegate('li', 'hover', function (e)
[02:10:59] <platinoid> greg5green: Heres what I have now http://fracktal.in/tms/addhours.php
[02:11:38] <platinoid> once you choose a project the jquery puts an extra select field everywhere
[02:11:45] <platinoid> :|
[02:12:03] <greg5green> is delegate still in 2.0? it was superceded by on a while ago
[02:14:26] <motox> greg5green> Ah, that could be it.  It would be nice if there was a note at the top of the delegate documentation then :-/.   I will convert the old code to .on() and see if that fixes it
[02:14:27] <motox> thanks
[02:14:38] <greg5green> yeah, its in there, just not at the top :)
[02:14:51] <greg5green> platinoid
[02:15:23] <greg5green> its because you are using the same id for everything
[02:16:16] <greg5green> instead of targeting specific stuff
[02:16:28] <greg5green> (also, you shouldn't ever have more than one element with one id)
[02:17:30] <platinoid> how can I have the addrow button generate rows with different Id and traget them by the jquery and scripts I am running
[02:18:23] <platinoid> gre5green?
[02:18:59] <platinoid> greg5green: any directions?
[02:19:09] <greg5green> im not going to completely do it for you
[02:19:11] <greg5green> but for example
[02:20:02] <greg5green> for the change event
[02:20:13] <greg5green> youd want to listen for the class projects
[02:20:15] <greg5green> instead of the id
[02:20:24] <greg5green> (and obviously add the class to the html)
[02:20:42] <motox> greg5green: That fixed it, thanks.  I new delegate was deprecated, but I didnt see it was removed.  It was some old code that I was just too lazy to update until now, hehe
[02:21:03] <greg5green> and then instead of $('.tasks').show(); do $this.find('.tasks').show()
[02:21:10] <greg5green> good looks motox
[02:21:40] <greg5green> I'm not terrible familiar with it, but there is a migrate script that can help you know when things are deprecated
[02:21:55] <greg5green> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[02:24:36] <motox> Sweet, thanks
[02:25:17] <motox> Actually, delegate isnt removed yet from the looks of it.  Just hover method is.   I had to switch to on() and use 'mouseenter mouseleave' instead of 'hover'
[02:25:26] <greg5green> ah
[02:25:37] <motox> hover keyword was removed in 2.x
[02:25:59] <motox> Again, it was noted way further down, hehe
[02:26:41] <greg5green> i should have known that
[02:26:59] <greg5green> but havent built/started any projects with jquery since 1.9 or 2.0 came out
[02:27:23] <greg5green> well, thats not entirely true, i did start one, but used dojo
[02:53:10] <DelicateFlower> where can i find the list of how i can select elements with $?

[04:47:49] <platinoid> Hello people, I have a time entry form where 4 inputs exist, select project based on which select task is generated, 3rd is a hidden text input which shows when option "Add task is selected" This is being achieved with jquery & js. Fourth and last is time entry for each day of week .Now what I did is included an "Add Row" button that replicates these 4 fields on click. The change in one select field is mirrored across all of them. How can I have them t

[05:24:31] <lenswipee> hey guys, i got a problem with replacing .live() with .on(). The .on() no longer registers a click event when the element is replaced. Though it works fine with .live().
[05:26:09] <lenswipee> ... replaced with an identical element that is
[05:35:54] <lenswipee> ? .on
[05:36:01] <bot-t> lenswipee, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:36:01] <lenswipee> ?on
[05:36:02] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[05:53:08] <Renari> Does anyone know how passing css an array works? I read that you can do it but couldn't find an example anywhere, so I tried this http://jsfiddle.net/qLnWs/ but it doesn't work.
[05:58:31] <boytoy> At http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/ or my own example: http://jsbin.com/ayulow/5/edit -- if you scroll all the way down, how to prevent the content from jumping back up once you load the side panel?
[06:10:35] <Renari> boytoy, you could use .scrollTop to get the current scroll position and then set the value to be the same.
[06:11:54] <dabear> Renari: css is empty. arrays are indexed. you cannot do css["width"] = ... on an array.
[06:12:02] <dabear> Renari: you want an object
[06:12:10] <dabear> css = {};
[06:12:17] <lenswipee> hey guys, i got a problem with replacing .live() with .on(). The .on() no longer registers a click event when the element is replaced. Though it works fine with .live().
[06:12:42] <boytoy> Renari: cool
[06:12:50] <boytoy> Renari: sorry set the value to be the same where?
[06:12:53] <lenswipee> i tried .delegate() but that didn't work either
[06:13:22] <Renari> boytoy, .scrollTop() returns the current scroll position, .scrollTop(value) sets it.
[06:14:15] <Renari> Also thanks dabear.
[06:15:34] <Ansikt> lenswipee:  The problem might be that you're not delegating the event far enough up.  Can you show us actual code?
[06:17:06] <lenswipee> Ansikt: My $.ajax replaces the element with another same element, which worked fine in .live() but not .on() or delegate
[06:17:15] <boytoy> Renari: ah like that - thank you
[06:18:54] <lenswipee> Ansikt: Registering a bunch of events in the call back function is annoying.
[06:19:14] <Ansikt> lenswipee:  Exactly, which is why I'm saying you're not delegating the element far enough up.  Try it like this $('body').on('click', '.some-class',function(){/*do stuff here*/})
[06:19:28] <Ansikt> Where .some-class is the selector you want to target, of course.
[06:20:17] <Ansikt> Granted, this is a very inefficient way of doing this, probably, and you're going to want to choke up as close as possible to the element you're replacing with ajax, BUT, it should show if this is your problem or not.
[06:21:26] <lenswipee> Ansikt: Right, how do you work out how far up it suppose to be?
[06:21:59] <lenswipee> Ansikt: Above the replaced elements?
[06:23:24] <Ansikt> lenswipee:  Exactly.  That's how delegated events work.  Since you can't (on load) attach an event to an element that's going to be added after load, you have to attach it to a parent which you can trust will always be there, then determine if the target is the selector you want or not.
[06:24:54] <lenswipee> Ansikt: probably good to use id then
[06:25:28] <lenswipee> Ansikt: might be slow if the element is way at the bottom
[06:26:09] <lenswipee> Ansikt: Thanks for the tip.
[06:26:45] <Ansikt> lenswipee: There's no reason to ever use an ID.  But yeah, that's how it works.
[06:27:34] <lenswipee> .live() was smarter but was not reliable hence it was deprecated
[06:34:17] <Ansikt> lenswipee: actually, the opposite is true.  live is exactly the same as the example code I posted: it always delegates events from the html element.  It was deprecated because it was slow, not because it was unreliable.
[06:38:54] <Kuifje111> hi all
[06:40:00] <Kuifje111> I have a question regarding collapsible lists. is it possible to have the list opened when the page is loaded instead of collapsed?
[06:42:02] <Kuifje111> never mind

[06:45:56] <JaxTrust> Hi, i'm trying to run two different jquery plugins in succession but it looks like it's not working if i put them on different lines. Right now I tried to use end but that doesn't seem to work either. Any hints how i should go about something like this?
[06:46:33] <christophler_> hello #jquery
[06:46:43] <christophler_> anyone know much about threading and scheduling?
[06:50:04] <JaxTrust> Would a queue enable me to have have function X execute only after Y finishes?
[07:17:57] <kahunau> Im building a web app and do everything through ajax after page load. So when i do an http post jquery.ajax request, and the user presses the browser backbutton, does the resubmit form dialog show up or not (since it's ajax) ?
[07:20:52] <christophler_> im looking for a multithreading solution for javascript
[07:22:33] <_rgn> kahunau: no
[07:24:27] <kahunau> thank you _rgn ;)
[07:25:41] <velcrow> Is it possible to run a command (say, console.log(..)) as soon as $(document).ready(function(){ is started?
[07:25:49] <velcrow> I am trying, but no luck.
[07:27:24] <bealtine> of course its possible
[07:39:01] <velcrow> bealtine, So any reason why it wouldn't work?
[07:39:36] <bealtine> i'm not psychic
[07:41:24] <bealtine> define "not work"?
[07:42:50] <velcrow> bealtine, Sure. So I have $(document).ready(function(){ console.log("test") }); this doesn't work. But ..
[07:43:18] <bealtine> have you "included" jquery?
[07:43:19] <Kuifje111> do you get any error messages in the console?
[07:44:01] <velcrow> If I have soemthing like  $(document).ready(function(){     $("#test_p").click(function() {console.log("test") });     });      it works
[07:44:10] <velcrow> Yes, I have included jquery
[07:44:17] <velcrow> No, no error messages
[07:45:34] <velcrow> I have the entire script inside <script type="text/javascript"> </script> tag, and above it, I have <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/third_party/jquery-1.10.1.js"></script>
[07:46:09] <velcrow> Which I know is the correct path, because other Jquery stuff works fine.
[07:47:28] <velcrow> I am just unable to call any type of operation inside document ready function unless I bind something to an action (e.g. .click).
[07:48:35] <bealtine> make a jfiddle to demonstrate...otherwise we're just guessing
[07:49:15] <velcrow> bealtine, Sure.
[07:54:08] <gry> what do i use to change the href in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/gryllida/Ej23x/

[08:02:29] <gry> http://jsfiddle.net/gryllida/Ej23x/1/ is an updated version, i am still clueless as to why it doesn't update the href as i expected

[09:01:58] <shoky> on a jquery object you mean ;P
[09:05:29] <gry> shoky: no, on a non-jquery object but i was thinking it was a jquery one and that function name is okay ... then what you said too
[09:06:02] <shoky> element objects (non-jquery) DO have a getAttribute method

[09:16:16] <RonWhoCares> I was wondering how to trigger a jQuery AJAX with text ?  What changes need to be made to:   <input type="text" class="edit" id="41" value="The Verse of the Day" />    I want the user to click on ' The Verse of the Day' as a link    I am using this for editing a directory
[09:17:52] <shoky> RonWhoCares: what do you want to do exactly? very unclear so far
[09:18:13] <shoky> you want the user to click on the textbox  and have that trigger some ajax?
[09:18:45] <RonWhoCares> I want the user to be able to click on " The Verse of the Day " in the form of a text link triggering an ajax
[09:19:06] <shoky> in the form of a text link?
[09:19:14] <shoky> you want a link saying ‚ÄúThe Verse of the Day‚Äù ?
[09:19:17] <shoky> why not make one?
[09:20:20] <RonWhoCares> I know how to trigger an ajax using a graphic as the input
[09:20:21] <RonWhoCares> (what the user clicks on)
[09:20:28] <RonWhoCares> I don't know how to start an ajax with text
[09:20:41] <shoky> what does ‚Äúwith text‚Äù mean
[09:21:11] <shoky> you showed a textbox. do you want something else instead of that textbox or not
[09:21:21] <RonWhoCares> I don't want a textbox
[09:21:26] <shoky> ok, what do you want
[09:21:33] <shoky> just text?  make a <span>
[09:21:34] <RonWhoCares> I want to use the words as the link
[09:21:42] <shoky> if you want a link, make an <a>
[09:21:56] <RonWhoCares> I don't want the web page to re-load
[09:22:14] <shoky> then give it href=‚Äù#‚Äù  or event.preventDefault() when clicked
[09:22:29] <RonWhoCares> ahh
[09:22:48] <shoky> (‚Äúevent‚Äù being the argument sent to the click handler)
[09:33:24] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Am I missing something simple?  Clicking the text ' The Verse of the Day ' doesn't bring up the alert  http://jsfiddle.net/ac3qm/
[09:33:51] <shoky> RonWhoCares: didn‚Äôt include jquery
[09:34:16] <shoky> RonWhoCares: also you didn‚Äôt put ‚Äúevent‚Äù as first argument to the click handler
[09:35:21] <shoky> RonWhoCares: also:  this.id  is so much nicer than  $(this).attr(‚Äòid‚Äô)
[09:40:31] <RonWhoCares> ok

[09:49:26] <HiDensity> hello
[09:49:55] <HiDensity> i am having problems with JSON on IE8
[09:51:05] <HiDensity> here is my json file:
[09:51:06] <HiDensity> http://pastebin.com/rwTWwnjp
[09:52:33] <HiDensity> Here is my html:
[09:52:34] <HiDensity> http://pastebin.com/QepWGHQi
[09:53:27] <HiDensity> it seems the issue is when I try to get info from an nested object within the json
[09:55:37] <shoky> HiDensity: what‚Äôs the problem?
[09:56:12] <HiDensity> well‚Ä¶when I had a simple json structure like this:
[09:56:59] <HiDensity> http://pastebin.com/zXk08jYU
[09:57:06] <HiDensity> it worked fine in IE8
[09:57:37] <HiDensity> but as soon as I made the json more complex it broke in IE8
[09:57:56] <HiDensity> i verified that the json is valid‚Ä¶at least according to http://pro.jsonlint.com/
[09:58:02] <shoky> that‚Äôs not proper JSON
[09:58:14] <shoky> it‚Äôs a bunch of JSON objects with commas between them
[09:58:17] <HiDensity> and it works in modern browsers‚Ä¶just fails in IE8
[09:58:37] <HiDensity> this is my first time experimenting with json
[09:58:55] <HiDensity> so i was relying on the online validator
[09:59:32] <shoky> well that validator fails if you put in this JSON  http://pastebin.com/zXk08jYU
[09:59:49] <shoky> as it should. but anyways
[09:59:52] <shoky> ?doesn‚Äôt work

[10:00:47] <shoky> oops
[10:01:38] <shoky> ?doesn't work
[10:01:38] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[10:01:41] <shoky> yay.
[10:08:43] <HiDensity> shoky: so this is valid JSON‚Ä¶but IE8 says the data object is undefined:
[10:08:44] <HiDensity> http://pastebin.com/HR0uYk4V
[10:09:39] <HiDensity> works as expected in FF, Chrome and Safari
[10:16:42] <shoky> HiDensity: seems to work fine for me
[10:23:20] <HiDensity> shoky:  on IE8?
[10:24:46] <shoky> ya
[10:24:55] <shoky> ?demo
[10:24:55] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:25:04] <shoky> got a link?
[10:28:37] <Ungy> you wouldn't be attempting to you teh JSON.parse object in IE8 woud you
[10:29:05] <Ungy> or should I say function
[10:29:49] <shoky> HiDensity: btw this is what worked fine for me: http://jsbin.com/ekizeh/3   i commented out the columnize stuff
[10:33:57] <HiDensity> shoky:  thats great!
[10:34:28] <shoky> it is?
[10:34:45] <HiDensity> looks like just putting the $(document).ready(function ad the end of the file fixes it?
[10:35:17] <shoky> i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it...
[10:36:33] <HiDensity> hmm‚Ä¶just did that to my local copy and it is not working on all browsers
[10:37:05] <shoky> uhm. are you running it on the local filesystem? not on a webserver?
[10:37:19] <shoky> like.. a file:// url
[10:37:20] <HiDensity> with this JSON:  http://pastebin.com/0GTzEcvm
[10:37:33] <HiDensity> no using mamp
[10:37:37] <shoky> k
[10:37:57] <shoky> then i donno what problem you‚Äôre seeing. set up a live link reproducing the issue
[10:38:56] <HiDensity> i think it was invalid JSON actually
[10:39:19] <HiDensity> arghhh‚Ä¶dunno how I missed that
[10:39:23] <shoky> eh.
[10:39:43] <HiDensity> shoky: thanks for your help!

[10:47:01] <ner0x> Has anyone in here successfully used jQuery FileUploader to upload multiple files directly to S3?
[11:10:57] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) I have 4000 elements. For each element i make an ajax call to put data into it. That works, but the problem is, that the calls dont happen parallel, so until all data is in those elements, it takes a few seconds. Is there a possibility to make those calls parallel?
[11:13:14] <hemanth> Kolorbon, http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/ ?
[11:14:59] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: if you use more async things within your app/website I'd use async.js (in this example asyn.parallel)
[11:15:47] <hemanth> MaddinXx, how about taskjs.org ?
[11:17:41] <MaddinXx> hemanth: don't know this. you're using it? there are several libs out there but personally I found async.js the easiest, most powerful and most active developed :)
[11:18:13] <Kolorbon> Ok, but how can I use those with $.each?
[11:19:47] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: if they are independent you could split them into say 8 groups of 500 and run 8 parallel jobs (see here: https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel))
[11:20:10] <hemanth> MaddinXx, ok :) I liked taskjs
[11:20:50] <MaddinXx> anyway - I'm not sure if splitting/running async make things faster as this isn't like having multiple threads in Java etc...
[11:21:11] <MaddinXx> I've seen an article about spotting multiple JS workers some days ago...you might want to research on that too
[11:21:41] <MaddinXx> depending if you're using it client or server side..
[11:22:14] <Kolorbon> But my problem is, idk. how to use it with $('...').each(ajaxRequest);
[11:24:40] <ggdevelop> hey i have ajax call inside a function thet returns boolean value. and in the callback function(data) i have if(data==0) return true else return false. but its not working.
[11:25:58] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ee59506a079a7633219c
[11:26:07] <hemanth> ggdevelop, did you console.log(data) ?
[11:26:33] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: not sure about the splitting part (not so familiar with JS in general and it's data types) but you see how it could work
[11:27:29] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Thanks ;)
[11:34:54] <ggdevelop> hemanth: no. whats that?
[11:38:50] <hemanth> ggdevelop, it's not working, means?
[11:42:12] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: I tried it with all 4000 elements, but the code does not seem working.
[11:42:34] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: you fixed length to length - 1
[11:42:35] <MaddinXx> ?
[11:43:17] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Does not change anything.
[11:43:41] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: would you mind uploading your code somewhere so we can inspect it?
[11:43:57] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: http://jsfiddle.net/DjuS2/
[11:47:15] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/805dc945ba17ad368778 -- does it reach the success callback on bottom that way?
[11:47:57] <Kolorbon> Nope.
[11:48:25] <Kolorbon> the function(err, results) just logs "undefined:({})"
[11:48:50] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: well but it reaches it
[11:49:05] <MaddinXx> so the flow is correct
[11:49:11] <Kolorbon> Ah, the second function is the callback, or what?
[11:49:41] <MaddinXx> the one at bottom, yes. it's called when ALL parallel functions have finished (e.g. all have called callback(null)
[11:49:57] <Kolorbon> Ahh.
[11:50:46] <MaddinXx> so line 2-16 is 1 parallel job; 3-15 is this job and 18-20 is called when all jobs are done
[11:51:07] <Kolorbon> Ok, now it works.
[11:51:14] <Kolorbon> I just forgot [ and ].
[11:51:44] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: but keep in mind. you have another settimeout within your job -> this won't block...
[11:51:53] <MaddinXx> this one: IkariamLittleTweaks.xhrFunctions.getMineLevels(g)
[11:52:12] <Kolorbon> That has to be in timeout.
[11:52:34] <Kolorbon> Because of GreaseMonkey.
[11:53:25] <MaddinXx> but isn't it somehow logic-less than. I guess this function does the main work and you don't wait for it...e.g. the final callback (line 18-20) will most likely be called before those have finished
[11:54:08] <Kolorbon> And how to do it then?
[11:56:43] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: one moment
[12:01:27] <ggdevelop> i hava an ajax call to php and its not work. and when i put .fail(alert "fiailing") , its call the php like it should. without it it dosent. dose someone know way?
[12:01:38] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/366575d64b4d4b6375b1 does this help?
[12:02:30] <MaddinXx> ggdevelop: sure it's not a syntax error then?
[12:02:31] <Patrycjusz> Hi All, Can i toggle PHP code snippet in document ?
[12:03:29] <Patrycjusz> i want to add php code on 700px document width and remove if widht is over 700px
[12:04:09] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: you might want to add a callback to your getMineLevels function, you understand?
[12:04:20] <Kolorbon> Ah, yes.
[12:07:35] <MaddinXx> good. check here for another example: https://github.com/MaddinXx/ch.schwingenonline.android/blob/develop/assets/www/assets/js/cordova.js#L33-L61 && https://github.com/MaddinXx/ch.schwingenonline.android/blob/develop/assets/www/assets/js/app.js#L176-L217
[12:10:05] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: so I come to your page with my browser being 900px wide...when I resize down to 650 something changes.
[12:10:18] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: ?
[12:11:16] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx: something like this i want remove or add PHP code to my document
[12:11:21] <Patrycjusz> using jQuery
[12:11:32] <ggdevelop> MaddinXx: yes im sure
[12:11:54] <Patrycjusz> for example when document width is 700 or less i want change php code
[12:13:02] <Patrycjusz> i use $(window).width()
[12:13:15] <Patrycjusz> it is ok for css
[12:13:19] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Now everything works fine, but now I just need a solution that the calls go faster. The best would be, that every call runs parallel the other one.
[12:13:41] <Kolorbon> *to the other one*
[12:14:31] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: what makes me confused is "add PHP". PHP is executed on open, e.g. when I visit your site. later on you can make ajax calls and get their result... is it that you want?
[12:14:57] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx agrr im so stupid
[12:15:01] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx right
[12:15:46] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx what i want to do is swap navigation on wordpress for responsive design
[12:16:23] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: let me check that for you...if you want all to be parallel... you might need async inside the each loop then and not outside
[12:19:33] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: The ajax request is inside it. For each element a request.
[12:19:45] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: I wouldn't do that with Ajax...juse use CSS/JS
[12:20:19] <ggdevelop> MaddinXx: i was worng there was a syntax error in the fail function. but now the fail function works, the ajax call is failing but i have no clue why
[12:20:21] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: jujup. just checking if you can dynamically create "jobs"
[12:21:42] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: async.each might help -> https://github.com/caolan/async#each
[12:22:16] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: as you know have the basic understanding of the async lib I'm sure you manage to get it working
[12:22:36] <MaddinXx> ggdevelop: paste somewhere so we can see
[12:22:44] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Thanks
[12:23:10] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: if you want to, do like so:
[12:24:17] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: window resize event -> check width -> do ajax request passing true/false (for <700 | >700) and the Ajax call/php script will return the html for the nav -> e.g. #ul.html(the result)
[12:25:50] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: but I wouldn't do it that way.... I'm pretty sure if can more or less easily be done using CSS/basic JS/jQuery onl
[12:25:51] <MaddinXx> y
[12:26:07] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx: thanks ill go for css, problem i have is in my menu i have submenu so i think i need use js to remove some classes
[12:27:32] <MaddinXx> Patrycjusz: or just override it's css... @media screen and (max-width: 700px) { /* styles for < 700px screens go here */ }
[12:30:03] <Patrycjusz> MaddinXx: thanks
[12:34:42] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: coming back to you. as said, it won't help much running them all async -> it's not real multithreading...better do ase we did with one final callback when all is done...that way the rest doesn't block (e.g. other JS continues to work/run) and you can show the result when everything is don
[12:34:42] <MaddinXx> e
[12:36:03] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: that's how it is...I had the same problem with a PHP script I coded....PHP doesn't support multithreading by default so I can just make sure my script doesn't block while this long-going action is running
[12:36:52] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: you'd better go off doing the multithreading on server side (if you use Python, Ruby, Java or anything like that)...
[12:37:03] <Eviltwin> Please tell me this isn't a discussion about async: false for $.ajax
[12:38:10] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Ok, but why do I anyway need a callback, when I just add text into each element? And, I do nothing serverside. Remember: I use GreaseMonkey.
[12:40:37] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: callbacks are only needed if you want to do things async (meaning while this operation runs, it won't block the rest of your code ... as code proceeds from top to bottom) but want to do something as soon as this async operation has finished
[12:41:06] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: let me write down an example before I leave
[12:43:41] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: you have a UI with 2 tabs named "Main" and "Upload". main just shows some text and upload contains a form for uploading files. when user A switches to tab "upload" and uploads a file you should run this async -> the upload should do it's job in background. why? if you don't do it that way user A can not switch tab while the file is uploading. but probably he wants to check something there wh
[12:43:41] <MaddinXx> ile the file is uploading..... and now: why you need the callback? well, you could inform him as soon as it's done so he can switch to upload tab again where you tell him like: "thanks, file is uploaded".
[12:45:06] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: this may be a stupid example but I guess it does a good job to make things clear(er)
[12:45:47] <Kolorbon> Yes, it does. But in this case I dont need a callback. The elements should just be there as soon as possible.
[12:49:13] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: then yes. If you don't want to do something when ALL have loaded you don't need this :)
[12:49:38] <MaddinXx> Kolorbon: so I'm leaving. have fun finding a good solution for your problem :)
[12:49:49] <Kolorbon> MaddinXx: Thanks, bye ;)
[12:53:14] <dwarder> <button onmouseover="myJsStuffHere();"> is the same as .on({mouseenter       , right?
[12:57:54] <momomomomo> dwarder: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/ - your <button onmouseover=""> binds that object to the javascript event. From the JQ docs: "Description: Bind an event handler to the "mouseover" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element."
[13:00:34] <dwarder> momomomomo: is there something for .on that resembles mouseover ?
[13:01:13] <momomomomo> dwarder:  Did you even open the link to that doc page?
[13:06:39] <dwarder> momomomomo: i need .on 'cause i need a delegate
[13:07:10] <momomomomo> ok dwarder I'll do the reading for you: "This method is a shortcut for .on('mouseover', handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger('mouseover') in the third."
[13:07:51] <Eviltwin> dwarder: mouseenter and mouseleave bubble
[13:08:02] <dwarder> momomomomo: why i don't see mouseover on this page http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:08:50] <momomomomo> dwarder: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[13:09:03] <dwarder> ohh, me sucks, sorry
[13:09:10] <dwarder> momomomomo: thank you
[13:09:23] <momomomomo> No problem dwarder, next time read a lil more thoroughly :p
[13:10:44] <dwarder> momomomomo: just to clarify, i can use something like this $('#outerDiv')on('mouseover','#innerDiv',function ?
[13:10:47] <dwarder> right
[13:10:48] <dwarder> ?
[13:12:00] <momomomomo> dwarder: For my health, just open the page and read it. http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[13:12:42] <dwarder> momomomomo: i have a huge headache, can you just say yes? ;)
[13:14:00] <momomomomo> no.
[13:14:21] <dwarder> ;( haha ok
[13:23:22] <Ansikt> momomomomo, you can, except for the missing . before on.
[13:24:47] <momomomomo> Ansikt: I'm saying no to spoon feeding him/her, not the direct question. He/she can read a doc page or two
[13:25:27] <Ansikt> Oh, I was answering their original question, but directing it at the wrong person.  Mah bad
[13:28:50] <snkcld> with $.on('unload'), can i see when the page is changing, and add a value to the URL?
[13:29:00] <snkcld> how do i get the destination URL?
[13:30:35] <momomomomo> snkcld: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1686687/how-can-i-get-the-destination-url-in-javascript-onbeforeunload-event
[13:31:11] <snkcld> ah yes, of course... i just want to append the music players current time, so that i can pick up at that point in the new page ;(
[13:31:36] <snkcld> i would say to add to the POST data, but if the request isnt a POST...
[13:31:51] <snkcld> does the hash of a URL persist?
[13:32:15] <momomomomo> Sounds like this would be a great place for a function to handle the link request
[13:32:40] <momomomomo> rather than trying to quick catch the page info before it loads. IE: this should be part of your post data from the beginning.
[13:33:08] <snkcld> would i have to modify the anchor links? or just add a jQuery event handler for when a link is clicked?
[13:33:18] <snkcld> and attach it to all anchors?
[13:34:08] <momomomomo> Up to you
[13:39:56] <dysf> would anyone have a moment to help me with an async postback question?
[13:41:16] <shoky> dysf: not if you don't ask it
[13:44:37] <dysf> I am using an updatepanel, that on partial postback has been causing me to lose my active jquery ui tab.  I am using a body onload javascript function to trigger loading the tabs again, but am having trouble setting the active tab.  I am using a hidden field and can successfully change its value.  The onload correctly recreates the tabs including the active tab if I hard code 'active: 1' but
[13:44:37] <dysf> not if I use 'active: getElementById("hdnSelectedTab").value'
[13:46:53] <dysf> here is a snapshot of the code: http://jsfiddle.net/5eP9Q/
[13:48:12] <shoky> got a live link? cause that doesn't really show what you're doing
[13:48:19] <dysf> nevermind...amateur hour.  Missing 'document.'
[13:48:30] <shoky> heh
[13:48:58] <dysf> nothing like beating your head against something for 30 minutes, asking for help, then figuring it out 5 seconds later
[13:49:42] <shoky> console is your friend
[13:54:31] <dysf> good call, I've never used console before.  Just tried it by breaking the code again. Works nicely :)
[14:00:23] <freebir> you guys, I'm trying to validate my form, using jquery for error messages, and the form is being sent even if there's an error, it's like I need to stop it in there, and it doesn't, http://www.advocaciagg.com.br/claro/ajaxpost.php  , notice that if you only fill the first field, and send it shows a message that the next field is empty, than another message saying the form was sent
[14:01:07] <freebir> I want to stop the script after the error message, not send the form, and insert in the database
[14:02:11] <momomomomo> freebir: First, there are plenty of jquery plugins that do this for you, secondly, if you want to roll your own: check out a tutorial like this http://www.camcloud.com/blog/jquery-form-validation-tutorial
[14:04:05] <freebir> momomomomo, how do I stop the script, and not allow the same to be sent ? like after the error message, please
[14:04:58] <inthl> I am using jquery 1.6.2 and I am really getting annoyed about a simple tiny thing. There is a table that is normally visible and should vanish when someone clicks a link. The thing is when I use $(document).ready(function(){ $(".table_123").fadeOut("slow", "swing"); }); - then it works, as mentioned, at document ready (when the site is loaded)
[14:05:27] <inthl> but when I replace that with $(".showmenu_123").click(function(){ - where some link has the class showmenu_123, then nothing happens. Any ideas why?
[14:08:13] <momomomomo> inthl: post your code to http://gist.github.com
[14:11:05] <inthl> well there is nothing much to say, but here it is: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5892683
[14:11:51] <freebir> momomomomo, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5892688
[14:12:53] <momomomomo> inthl: You're trying to fade out an element which has already been hidden
[14:14:06] <momomomomo> If you're showing it earlier, make sure that the second function also runs after doc load, otherwise the element might not exist in the DOM yet.
[14:14:08] <momomomomo> inthl:
[14:14:10] <inthl> sry, this one script above is being replaced entirely by that second <script>, this was for you to compare - the first <script>...</script> works, the second which replaces the first, dies not
[14:14:35] <momomomomo> freebir: http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:15:11] <momomomomo> inthl: Same answer: make sure that the second function also runs after doc load, otherwise the element might not exist in the DOM yet.
[14:16:19] <inthl> cool, that is the answer :> thank you very much
[14:44:18] <b0fh_ua> Hi! quick noob question - how do I find all radiobuttons with certain ID and remove 'checked' attribute?
[14:51:21] <shoky> b0fh_ua: ID's should be unique
[14:51:30] <shoky> b0fh_ua:  $('#mycheckbox').prop('checked', false)
[14:57:53] <freebir> I'm reading the link, trying to modify, but I got stucked, the first input text is called input:first, what about the second one ? how do I refer to the second input type text by a name or id ? if ($("input:first").val() == "correct"), I would like to do something like this: if ($("input:first").val() == "correct" && $("input:field2").val() == "abc") {...
[14:58:00] <freebir> momomomomo,
[14:59:01] <momomomomo> input:first just returns the first input on the page
[14:59:07] <momomomomo> or, the first input that jquery finds, actually
[14:59:24] <momomomomo> $('#my_input_id').val()
[15:05:39] <__matias__> I haven't found a clear answer anywhere as to whether it is possible to build jquery api docs for offline consultation. I guess it would be documented if possible, but just in case I have not looked properly, I am asking here :)
[15:05:50] <__matias__> note: I build my own dist files through git sources + npm + grunt
[15:10:39] <b0fh_ua> shoky: okay, thats clear
[15:11:06] <b0fh_ua> shoky: but how do I find all items of specific type?

[15:54:51] <grafi> that doesnt seem right :P
[15:55:03] <grafi> 24.0a2 (2013-06-28)
[15:55:08] <hypebadger-h> ahh i'm on 21
[15:55:10] <hypebadger-h> sec
[15:55:11] <grafi> maybe thats why
[15:55:24] <hypebadger-h> working ok for me and on chrome
[15:55:25] <grafi> but it usually doesnt break things being on aurora
[15:55:31] <grafi> jep for me too
[15:57:27] <shoky> b0fh_ua: what do you mean "items of specific type"?  to find all checkboxes you can do $('[type=checkbox]')  though that's inefficient. better to give them a class
[16:00:23] <platinoid> why isnt this simple 2 line jquery not working onclick http://jsfiddle.net/
[16:03:19] <grafi> lol
[16:03:26] <grafi> platinoid its empty ^^
[16:08:46] <platinoid> grafi: whoops, my bad http://jsfiddle.net/3pAZj/
[16:10:37] <grafi> no such thing as onclick in jquery platinoid
[16:12:35] <tw2113> ?on
[16:12:44] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:29:44] <Birliban> Hi, i have one little script that uses jquery and jquery mobile. This script is finished and wont be modified anymore, now i want to put everything into this one html file (without including the jquery from an extra file), how to do this? is it really copying all the jquery.js content into script section in <head>?
[16:30:49] <tw2113> you could link to a CDN provided copy of jquery
[16:31:32] <Birliban> the point is i need to use that offline. so i want to have all the code just in one offline file...
[16:32:18] <tw2113> must it absolutely be 1 single html file?
[16:32:25] <tw2113> or can it be a directory with a js file + html file?
[16:32:28] <megalomix> hello everybody
[16:33:03] <Birliban> tw2113, directory is an 'unwanted' option ;-)
[16:33:09] <megalomix> guys, i get the text of and input text doing:  $('input[name=myname]').val()
[16:33:22] <tw2113> then yes, you'll need to paste in the entire jQuery library into a script tag
[16:33:25] <megalomix> now, i would like to get the id of the form that has this input
[16:33:27] <megalomix> how can i do it ?
[16:34:13] <megalomix> or better...i would like to submit that form
[16:34:16] <megalomix> how can i do?
[16:34:28] <megalomix> i do not know the name, id or class
[16:34:38] <Birliban> tw2113, hmm, ok! Thanks anyway....
[16:34:38] <megalomix> i only know that there is a field named "myname"
[16:34:56] <Birliban> tw2113, maybe ther is a tool for that... gonna look for it
[16:35:09] <tw2113> a tool that would do what?
[16:35:25] <sahbeewah> megalomix, $('input[name=myname]').closest('form').submit()
[16:35:27] <tw2113> you either need to have it be a separate file, or pasted into the 1 file
[16:35:31] <tw2113> no other way around it
[16:35:42] <megalomix> sahbeewah, thank you!!
[16:38:18] <Birliban> tw2113, a tool that is doing this by parsing the file, finding the externally included files and put everything together in one big file ;-)
[16:38:33] <tw2113> so you want to compile an html file
[16:38:42] <Birliban> tw2113, but you'll be right... there wont be such a 'tool' yet ^^
[16:38:55] <Birliban> tw2113, yes, kind of this...
[16:38:56] <tw2113> i think you're needlessly complicating shit
[16:40:51] <Birliban> tw2113, yes, maybe... but what other way round? i need that script in my phone, even when i'm offline...
[16:42:06] <Birliban> so the best would be one single html file
[16:42:36] <tw2113> so copy/paste the whole lib into the file
[16:42:52] <Birliban> ok. ;-) will try this.
[16:46:04] <duanemoody> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFUI591WhI&feature=youtu.be&a
[16:46:10] <duanemoody> did anyone else watch this
[16:48:03] <tw2113> i'm on the keynote right now duanemoody
[16:48:45] <duanemoody> nathan's solution seems to be "instead of coding something to solve this problem, here's how you can make more work for yourself"
[16:49:06] <duanemoody> i mean he does show you how to solve the problem
[16:49:10] <duanemoody> but it's scutwork
[16:49:54] <duanemoody> wouldn't it make more sense to just add a method to methods that says "use the factory installed version of this method"
[16:50:45] <duanemoody> i
[16:51:04] <duanemoody> i'm all for making code sentient enough to avoid contextual problems
[16:51:48] <duanemoody> but if i have to put every single built-in into a wrapper, there's something wrong with the language, not my code
[17:00:42] <Codaraxis> I have a set of inputs that I'm working with and I want to define a set of responses dependant on which input has lost focus, with a default case for any non-specific inputs. What's the most effective way to go about this?
[17:01:21] <Codaraxis> I can't do a series of blur calls because $("input").blur(...) would call on all of them
[17:02:21] <bcham> Would someone mind helping me out with a quick question? I can't seem to figure out the equivalent of the now deprecated http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:02:22] <Codaraxis> Is there a way to check if $(this) matches $("input[name=blah]") ?
[17:03:09] <shoky> ?is
[17:03:10] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[17:04:32] <shoky> bcham: the direct equivalent to $(selector).live(events, fn)  is:   $(document).on(events, selector, fn)
[17:07:02] <Codaraxis> shoky: Excellent. Thank you. Just what I needed.
[17:08:06] <bcham> shoky, thanks
[17:11:53] <Skullclown> I've gotten so used to jQuery that I forgot how to bind events via regular javascript.. I want to bind a function to onchange without inline code
[17:12:50] <Skullclown> never mind, I'm an idiot :) .change vs .onchange
[17:14:11] <shoky> Skullclown: you mean .change vs .addEventListener('change', ..
[17:14:35] <shoky> (cause that's how you should do it in "regular" javascript)
[17:14:36] <Skullclown> shoky: is addEventListener the recommended cross-browser way?
[17:15:05] <shoky> cross-browser... no
[17:15:21] <shoky> that's what jquery (or alternative) is for
[17:15:23] <Skullclown> shoky: well I wouldn't know, I've mainly used jQuery in the past but I'm trying not to use it for a single event..
[17:15:26] <shoky> not plain javascript :P
[17:15:42] <shoky> but addEventListener works on everything except oldIE
[17:16:28] <Skullclown> is there a website that displays browser status on these things? addEventHandler vs document.getElementById('status').onchange
[17:16:51] <Skullclown> EventListener * it's getting late
[17:17:42] <shoky> MDN isn't bad for that.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Event_handlers
[17:18:22] <shoky> but addEventListener and onxyz  aren't the same thing. you can't set more than one event handler with .onchange, for example
[17:18:44] <Skullclown> true
[17:20:23] <Skullclown> thanks :)
[17:27:10] <Zesty> http://pastie.org/8095676
[17:27:21] <Zesty> How can I make all selects mirror the other one's selection?
[17:27:25] <Zesty> thats the error my code returns
[17:27:39] <Zesty> I'm assuming because by setting the value maybe thats triggering a change event recursively?
[17:28:15] <shoky> .val should be .val()
[17:28:24] <Zesty> ugh, derp
[17:28:48] <tw2113> taze me shoky
[17:29:09] <shoky> no, you'll perv on me
[17:29:16] <tw2113> promise i won't
[17:29:26] <tw2113> you can have me perma-banned if i do
[17:29:30] * shoky lobotomy tw2113
[17:29:51] <tw2113> that works
[17:30:33] <shoky> go eat an uncooked spaghetti & jelly sandwich
[17:30:47] <tw2113> mmm crunchy
[17:31:06] <shoky> i knew you'd appreciate the texture

[18:27:01] <ule> $("#moveDireita").click(function() {
[18:27:01] <ule> 					$.scrollLeft( $.scrollLeft()+500 );
[18:27:15] <ule> Why it isn't works well?
[18:27:29] <shoky> ule: there is no $.scrollLeft function
[18:27:51] <ule> shoky: what?
[18:28:06] <shoky> what what?
[18:28:10] <ule> shoky: As I read, $. is the same of $(window).
[18:28:26] <shoky> then you read lies, or you read wrong
[18:28:30] <ule> shoky: scrollLeft() is a function from jquery default
[18:28:39] <ule> shoky: ow.. sure?
[18:28:40] <shoky> $. is NOT the same as $(window).
[18:28:43] <shoky> 100% sure
[18:28:48] <ule> ow..
[18:29:21] <ule> lets try $(window)
[18:29:24] <ule> just a minute

[18:33:57] <freebir> shoky, I'm using this exaple: http://clareslab.com.br/learn/valida/
[18:34:31] <freebir> but after it validates, I want to send to enviar.php, like this: $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response) })
[18:34:35] <freebir> shoky,
[18:34:40] <ule> shoky: you right man!
[18:36:29] <shoky> freebir: why are you calling this..  $.validator.addMethod("cpf", function(value, element, type) {

[18:37:59] <shoky> freebir: not sure? why did you put it there...
[18:38:36] <freebir> shoky, I just copyed, should I remove ?
[18:38:45] <freebir> shoky, I'm still learning jquery
[18:39:18] <shoky> freebir: i dont know if you should remove, you're the one that put it there, i guess you had a reason. if there was no reason, then sure.. remove it
[18:39:37] <shoky> you can't expect to just copy stuff from other sites and have it work for your site
[18:39:47] <freebir> shoky, I need to validates CPF's
[18:40:04] <shoky> so?
[18:40:09] <shoky> not that i know what a cpf is\

[18:44:55] <freebir> shoky, ok, I get it, it seems it's sendin to enviar.php when the form is not validated, get it ? if you fill everything, there's an email field that we can't see it, in the end, that, it doesn't send, I need the oposite of that
[18:45:19] <shoky> whatever.
[18:45:38] <freebir> don't send to enviar while it's not validated, after it validates, sends to enviar.php, and echos the POSTS
[18:45:44] <freebir> shoky, get it ?

[18:46:10] <freebir> tryed everything
[18:46:26] <shoky> sorry, that's too messy for me and you're just copying shit from other sites not knowing wtf you're doing
[18:46:41] <shoky> and on top of that it's hard to understand your english
[18:47:29] <AWarrad> hi everybody
[18:47:37] <shoky> if you make a MINIMAL demo of the problem, with only what is needed for the specific problem you're trying to solve now, maybe me or someone can help you
[18:48:09] <shoky> minimal meaning it should be maximum ~20 lines of code. and 20 is a lot too
[18:49:11] <shoky> e.g. the page should be blank, with maybe one input and one submit button
[18:50:02] <freebir> ok, shoky, here it's problem minimized: http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[18:50:46] <freebir> shoky, after this validation, I want to make an ajax insert, that's inside enviar.php,  enviar.php is a fila that's in the same dir as index.php.
[18:51:10] <wh0ami> hi
[18:51:18] <wh0ami> any way to get with jquery a php data? like http://wotlk.openwow.com/?npc=37972&power=1
[18:51:19] <freebir> the validation is ok, now, after that, I want to send the values, inputs, to enviar.php, to make an ajax insert
[18:51:22] <freebir> shoky,
[18:51:22] <wh0ami> console says:  GET http://wotlk.openwow.com/?npc=37972&power=1 302 Moved Temporarily 94ms
[18:52:12] <shoky> freebir: i'm getting   CPF informado √© inv√°lido!
[18:52:22] <freebir> shoky, 29663668857
[18:52:27] <freebir> try this one shoky
[18:52:59] <AWarrad> freebir: are you brazilian?
[18:53:06] <freebir> AWarrad, yeah
[18:53:30] <shoky> freebir: ok it submitted.. and it reloaded the page i think
[18:53:35] <AWarrad> o que precisa?
[18:54:07] <freebir> shoky, yeah, at that time, I need the information to be sent to enviar.php so it gets inserted into the database
[18:54:42] <shoky> freebir: ok, i don't see that you're doing that on this page.
[18:55:45] <freebir> shoky, that's what I need to do,
[18:56:01] <shoky> then do it
[18:56:11] <freebir> a piece of code that sends the information to enviar.php so it inserts in the db
[18:56:14] <shoky> i need to see the problem...
[18:57:39] <wh0ami> any way to get with jquery a php data? like http://wotlk.openwow.com/?npc=37972&power=1
[18:57:42] <wh0ami> console says:  GET http://wotlk.openwow.com/?npc=37972&power=1 302 Moved Temporarily 94ms
[18:57:47] <freebir> shoky, I've showed to you man, all I need is after it validates to sendo to enviar.php the iinfo that was sent thru the form
[18:58:16] <shoky> freebir: you didn't show it to me in this "minimal" testcase. i dont care about the previous page, that was too messy to look at
[18:59:16] <freebir> shoky, that's why I created http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/ , after the validation, I want to send all the POST information to enviar.php that's inside the same dir man, what am I missing ?
[18:59:51] <shoky> freebir: you're missing that send..
[19:00:00] <shoky> freebir: i dont see the text "enviar.php" anywhere
[19:00:23] <freebir> shoky, yeah, i know, that's what I don't understand how to get it done
[19:00:44] <shoky> freebir: with $.post  for example
[19:02:27] <freebir> shoky, that line is in the other example, I'm not being able to undestand that, shoky , do you have this information ? where do I change, to make the post go to enviar.php after validated
[19:02:39] <shoky> freebir: remove lines 60-62 from jquery.validate.js
[19:02:45] <shoky> they're causing a double-submit
[19:03:01] <freebir> shoky, done
[19:03:48] <freebir> shoky, still doesn't send to enviar.php =(
[19:04:16] <shoky> freebir: i dont see that you removed it (from that claro3 page)
[19:04:21] <shoky> and i still dont see "enviar.php" there
[19:05:06] <freebir> shoky, http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro2/enviar.php
[19:05:11] <shoky> ?
[19:05:28] <shoky> seeing it when you say it is not seeing it in the code...
[19:05:49] <freebir> shoky, that's exactly my problem, I don't know how to add that line that sends to enviar.php, that's what I need
[19:05:57] <freebir> after it's validated shoky
[19:06:02] <shoky> with $.post for example
[19:06:12] <shoky> i'm not going to write it for you, if you haven't understood that yet
[19:06:14] <freebir> shoky, where ?
[19:06:24] <shoky> wherever you want it to be sent
[19:06:30] <freebir> $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response) })
[19:06:35] <freebir> shoky, this line works ?
[19:06:58] <shoky> i dont know, why dont you put it in there so we can see if it works :\
[19:07:07] <freebir> shoky, it doesn't
[19:07:13] <shoky> then why did you ask
[19:07:14] <freebir> didn't in many places
[19:07:18] <shoky> we're not talking about many places
[19:07:28] <shoky> there is only http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[19:08:00] <shoky> that's what you told me to look at
[19:09:03] <freebir> ok, they are the same shoky , where do I add a line to send everythin to enviar.php
[19:09:08] <freebir> enviar.php is here: http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/enviar.php shoky
[19:09:13] <shoky> wherever you want it to be sent
[19:09:22] <shoky> it doesn't help if the php is there, if you dont post to it
[19:09:36] <freebir> shoky, how do I post to it ?
[19:09:39] <freebir> please ? shoky
[19:09:39] <shoky> if you don't show me the problem happening, i can't help
[19:09:45] <shoky> with $.post for example
[19:10:18] <freebir> shoky, why are you doing this  ?I'm askin for help here, you are acting like if I knew, but I don't that's exactly why I'm asking
[19:10:46] <shoky> you want me to help with a problem i can't see?
[19:11:22] <freebir> shoky, man, there is no problem, no ERRORS, I just want to send the post info to enviar.php after that validation I showed you inside jquery.validate.js,
[19:11:25] <shoky> obviously if there is a problem, that means you dont know what to do. but i need to SEE the problem. so put that damn $.post in there already, where you think it should be, and we'll take it from there
[19:11:27] <freebir> that's it,
[19:11:32] <shoky> and i told you how
[19:11:36] <shoky> with $.post
[19:11:41] <shoky> and you didnt say what the problem with that is
[19:11:47] <freebir> shoky, that'1s the link ? $.post ???
[19:11:58] <freebir> should I try to place this exatly line anywhere ? shoky  ?
[19:12:09] <shoky> wherever you think it should be
[19:12:17] <shoky> it doesnt have to be the RIGHT place
[19:12:24] <shoky> but if its not anywhere, i cant see the problem, can i?
[19:12:39] <shoky> if you want it to be after the validation, put it after the validation
[19:12:46] <shoky> what's the problem?!
[19:12:51] <freebir> $.post won't know where to post
[19:13:10] <freebir> shoky, $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response) })
[19:13:26] <freebir> ?? this line ? how's the line I should try to insert in th ecode ?
[19:13:51] <shoky> <shoky> i dont know, why dont you put it in there so we can see if it works
[19:17:30] <shoky> i still didn't understand what the problem is. in your original page i submitted the form, and it posted just fine to enviar.php and gave a response which you said was good.
[19:19:09] <shoky> anyways if you can't follow a simple instruction like "PUT IT IN THERE" then i think we're done here
[19:21:00] <blockworks> hi how can i access a function foo that is defined like this in jquery: $(function() { function foo() {..} } ); ?
[19:21:06] <blockworks> i mean where in the namespace is it?
[19:22:08] <freebir> shoky, I did it, but the cache wont update,
[19:22:23] <tw2113> wouldn't it be $.foo() ?
[19:24:34] <Eviltwin> tw2113: No...
[19:24:45] <Eviltwin> blockworks: It's by default in a private and inaccessable scope
[19:24:46] <tw2113> i tried
[19:24:56] <blockworks> WOW THIS SUCKS SO MUCH
[19:25:00] <blockworks> Eviltwin: no chance?
[19:25:04] <Eviltwin> blockworks: You can put it in a more global scope if you want
[19:26:24] <blockworks> Eviltwin: how?
[19:26:30] <blockworks> note tht i am not controlling that site
[19:26:34] <blockworks> i am trying to debug it
[19:26:43] <freebir> shoky, done man, look what hapenned: http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[19:28:36] <Eviltwin> blockworks: http://jsfiddle.net/Fv5MJ/
[19:28:37] <Eviltwin> Like that
[19:28:44] <shoky> freebir: you made it post on page load..
[19:28:56] <freebir> shoky, where should I post that man ?
[19:29:11] <shoky> freebir: you said you wanted it to happen after validation
[19:29:20] <freebir> yeah
[19:29:29] <shoky> so why would you put it on page load?
[19:30:07] <blockworks> Eviltwin: i dont control the source
[19:30:10] <shoky> especially if you already had it sort-of working on submit in the other messy page..
[19:30:32] <Eviltwin> blockworks: So the function is defined inside a $(function () { ... }) and you don't control that code?
[19:30:41] <freebir> shoky, because I don't know where to put it, do you ?
[19:30:54] <shoky> freebir: after the validation?
[19:31:05] <Eviltwin> blockworks: If so you are shit out of luck, sorry.
[19:31:10] <imjakechapman> can anyone point me in the direction of getting the effect this website is getting on the first two slides??  http://editsquarterly.com/
[19:31:12] <blockworks> wow sucks
[19:31:15] <blockworks> thanks though
[19:31:19] <freebir> shoky, yeah
[19:31:27] <imjakechapman> or a plugin that allows multiple panels to do this?
[19:31:48] <shoky> freebir: cool. btw, if you don't want the form to actually submit, you need to return false from the submit handler
[19:31:58] <shoky> freebir:  or call event.preventDefault() on the event argument
[19:33:13] <imjakechapman> anyone?
[19:33:21] <freebir> shoky, you don't know shit man, go back to your family, I've some hard work in here
[19:33:30] <freebir> wasted my time, go play some where else
[19:33:44] <shoky> freebir: ok thanks for dropping by
[19:34:08] <miketaylr> wat
[19:34:13] <tw2113> alrighty then
[19:34:17] <tw2113> oh hi miketaylr
[19:34:20] <freebir> 30 minutes trying to get help from you, and all you do is, say things that make no sence, if you know, help, if you don't , just don't
[19:34:22] <miketaylr> sup tw2113
[19:34:31] <shoky> freebir: what did i say that doesn't make sense..?
[19:34:57] <shoky> freebir: i cant know without seeing the problem, and it took you 30 min just to finally put the code that actually does the post in there
[19:35:00] <tw2113> not much, it's saturday
[19:36:01] <freebir> shoky, if you knew, you would just say, put this line, in line ....
[19:36:06] <freebir> but you don't, like me
[19:36:11] <imjakechapman> awesome, well thanks guys lol
[19:36:23] <freebir> it's ok, the problem is you wasted my time pretending you knew
[19:36:25] <shoky> freebir: how can i know, without seeing the problem.  you talk about some .php but your code doesnt even call that php
[19:36:36] <freebir> shoky, there ISNT A PROBLEM man
[19:36:42] <shoky> good.
[19:36:43] <shoky> `cc
[19:36:43] <freebir> I need a lline to make a post to ENVIAR.PHP
[19:36:45] <shoky> ?cc
[19:36:46] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:36:53] <freebir> what's wron with that ????? what's so difficult ?
[19:37:05] <shoky> freebir: and i told you that you could do that with $.post   what's so difficult ?????
[19:37:09] <tw2113> wouldn't the call to the php file be part of the form's action attribute?
[19:37:26] <tw2113> or what shoky said too
[19:37:29] <shoky> tw2113: maybe, but he didn't have it there.. and he said he wanted ajax anyways
[19:37:31] <freebir> i know that, but I'm trying and I'm not being able to do it, that WHY IM HERE
[19:37:43] <miketaylr> lol irc
[19:37:57] <shoky> freebir:  you weren't trying, you were just asking the same questions over and over again, instead of trying to do what i asked you to do
[19:38:25] <shoky> freebir: and just when you finally did it and i started giving more useful advice, you get all pissy.
[19:39:33] <freebir> shoky,  you told me to do something I've on idea how, and you know I don't, so you are just tryingn to make things complicated, so I give up, and you don't have to say, ' I DONT KNOW'
[19:39:39] <freebir> loool, but tks for your time anyway
[19:39:54] <shoky> i told you to try... you didn't
[19:40:02] <freebir> 2 days trying man, 2 days
[19:40:06] <freebir> say anything, but that
[19:40:33] <tw2113> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYIW6MTigGQ
[19:40:37] <tw2113> *runs away*
[19:40:43] <shoky> wow, 2 days.
[19:40:59] <freebir> yeahhh, 2 days
[19:41:04] <freebir> going to 3
[19:41:08] <shoky> freebir: anyways. did you listen?
[19:41:12] <shoky> <shoky> freebir: cool. btw, if you don't want the form to actually submit, you need to return false from the submit handler
[19:41:13] <freebir> monday is my deadline
[19:41:16] <shoky>  <shoky> freebir:  or call event.preventDefault() on the event argument
[19:43:00] <freebir> shoky, can we talk abot lines ? I'm really new to jquery,
[19:43:15] <freebir> I'm lookin in here, have no idea about what you are talkin about
[19:43:26] <freebir>         $('form').attr('onsubmit','return false'); ?
[19:43:26] <shoky> freebir:  right now you're doing:  "return valid;"
[19:43:38] <shoky> i said:  return false;   if you dont want the form to actually submit
[19:43:40] <freebir> ok
[19:44:09] <tw2113> is onsubmit an attribute?
[19:45:08] <miketaylr> yeah, like an inline event handler
[19:45:22] <tw2113> gotcha, learning here
[19:45:24] <miketaylr> $('form').submit(fn) is the more jQuery way
[19:46:03] <freebir> shoky, now it looks like this: http://pastebin.com/FgHH96sN
[19:46:39] <shoky> freebir: i dont want to look at code. put the changes in our testcase  http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[19:46:48] <shoky> so we can RUN the code
[19:47:14] <shoky> freebir: and you still need to put the post somewhere
[19:47:29] <shoky> like, after the validation
[19:47:44] <freebir> shoky, I did it, in the bottom, near to the last return
[19:48:08] <shoky> in the bottom where..
[19:49:04] <imjakechapman> can anyone lead me in the right direction of how this website is doing what they're doing with the first two panels?? I want to do the same thing but with 8 panels ---> http://editsquarterly.com/
[19:50:27] <miketaylr> imjakechapman: looks like each "panel" is an <article> stacked on top of one another w/ z-index
[19:50:37] <imjakechapman> yea, I've got that far
[19:51:49] <imjakechapman> here is my current code
[19:51:55] <imjakechapman> it's only working for the first slide
[19:51:58] <imjakechapman> that's where I get stuck
[19:52:04] <tw2113> my guess is the js is in lib/js/edits.iancoyle.js?0.0.0.9
[19:52:20] <imjakechapman> yea I looked at his code and it's basically unreadable for me
[19:52:27] <imjakechapman> the way he set it all up
[19:52:53] <miketaylr> kinda weird how he puts everything on $
[19:53:07] <miketaylr> lol $.Tablet = ((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)));
[19:54:07] <imjakechapman> doesn't that just create a new jQuery object each time?
[19:54:22] <freebir> shoky, AWarrad found the problem, but tks for you help anyway man, tkss
[19:54:42] <tw2113> share the solution?
[19:54:47] <tw2113> don't leave us hangin' bro
[19:54:47] <freebir> shoky, where you told me to change to false, he told me to : 			if(valid){    $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response) });    return false;   }else{    return valid;   }
[19:55:02] <shoky> freebir: that was exactly the next step i would've told you to do
[19:55:06] <tw2113> better
[19:55:12] <freebir> shoky, okkkkkkkk,
[19:55:19] <freebir> I believe you
[19:55:54] <tw2113> i'm full of pizza and other things
[19:56:10] <miketaylr> imjakechapman: nah, you can put anything on $... it's just kind of weird to use jQuery as a namespace
[19:56:30] <imjakechapman> I get stuck because of the scrollTop, once the first slide goes out of view and I add the class of current-slide to the next 'panel' and then margin-top value is set to windowScroll thats like 1400px depending on browser size
[19:58:04] <miketaylr> oops, battery died
[19:58:18] <tw2113> lols
[19:58:42] <tw2113> you didn't miss anything mike
[20:03:18] <Codaraxis> I previously had a statement of the form, $("foo").blur( function() {$(this).bar()}, and I wanted to separate the contents of the function into its own declared function. However, "this" has a different meaning within the scope of a dedicated function.
[20:03:43] <Codaraxis> I also tried to pass "this" as a parameter to said function, and to replace instances of "this" with that paramater within the function code. Didn't work.
[20:04:00] <Codaraxis> What's the proper way to pass the necessary information to the function to be used?
[20:04:12] <tw2113> assign the proper $(this) to a variable
[20:04:15] <tw2113> and pass the var
[20:06:54] <Codaraxis> $("foo").blur( function() { var target = $(this); myFunc( target ) });  <-- does work, but it annoys me that I have to put in a function at all. Is there a nicer way than that?
[20:08:41] <wanderingwonderi> Anyone know of a script that automatically slides in a small DIV element (for example, a mailing list signup form) after spending X number of seconds on the page?
[20:12:38] <tw2113> wanderingwonderi, http://www.elated.com/articles/javascript-timers-with-settimeout-and-setinterval/
[20:15:21] <wanderingwonderi> tw2113: Great, thanks. Only solves a bit of the problem, though... I'm looking for a preexisting script that will somewhat unobtrusively slide a preexisting DIV element onto the page.
[20:15:48] <tw2113> and what part of those two functions wouldn't solve that?
[20:15:57] <TeddyMurray> anyone here familiar with webRTC?
[20:16:13] <tw2113> specifically setTimeOut()
[20:17:22] <cusco> hi
[20:17:38] <cusco> TeddyMurray: I'm familiar only with the concept
[20:18:05] <cusco> would like to read some experienced user talk about it tho
[20:18:14] <imjakechapman> http://jsfiddle.net/rT5Wb/6/embedded/result/ incase you want to check what I have so far and could help out on that 'panel' issue
[20:18:55] <wanderingwonderi> tw2113: Unless I'm missing something, this is just a timer.
[20:19:05] <tw2113> yeah
[20:19:12] <tw2113> that you can run code with after X time
[20:19:26] <tw2113> like moving in a div off screen
[20:19:38] <wanderingwonderi> Right... so it's a start, but specifically I'm looking for code that will move a div on screen.
[20:19:48] <tw2113> the code you put inside this timer
[20:19:53] <wanderingwonderi> Right
[20:19:59] <tw2113> that's simple css
[20:21:26] <freebir> shoky, all fine now, but after it's all done, I would like to redirect the page to another link, header location, using php, html, js wont work, any ideas ? anybody ?just a redirection   http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[20:26:30] <freebir> you guys, how to redirect my form after all ?? verifies ok, sends to database using ajax, but wont redirect after all, any ideas ?
[20:27:43] <cusco> location.replace()
[20:28:23] <freebir> cusco, where ?
[20:28:31] <freebir> I've tryed using js, wont go
[20:28:58] <cusco> what do you mean?
[20:29:04] <cusco> on the success: from ajax
[20:29:40] <cusco> window.location.replace("something.html");
[20:33:07] <freebir> cusco, http://pastebin.com/7cmtvGjp  wont reload
[20:33:36] <freebir> inserted the code in the end, after sending the email, it's inserting in the database and sending email, but wont reload
[20:33:38] <shoky> freebir: he means in the javascript file, after  $('html').append(response);  for example
[20:33:50] <shoky> freebir: you shouldn't put <script>s in the ajax response
[20:36:28] <freebir> shoky, 			if(valid){    $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response) }); window.location.replace("www.claro.com.br");    return false;  }else{    return valid;
[20:36:30] <shoky> er and appending to <html> doesn't seem right anyways
[20:36:31] <freebir> wont go, cusco
[20:36:57] <shoky> freebir: i said after $('html').append(response);
[20:37:04] <shoky> freebir: not after $('html').append(response);  });
[20:37:04] <cusco> freebir: is that php loaded via ajax?
[20:37:28] <shoky> freebir: inside that function(response) {  ... }
[20:37:53] <freebir> cusco, yes
[20:38:01] <shoky> why go to all this trouble to make it ajax, if you're gonna redirect anyway :\
[20:38:26] <cusco> freebir: ajax loaded file's javascript will not be executed
[20:38:39] <freebir> cusco, how should I proceed ?
[20:38:44] <cusco> normally, in the ajax request we read the response as json
[20:38:46] <freebir> shoky, not sure what you mean man
[20:38:48] <shoky> freebir:  you put it in the wrong place
[20:38:58] <freebir> shoky, where is the right place ?
[20:39:09] <shoky> freebir:  INSIDE  function(response) {  ... }
[20:39:10] <cusco> and in the page that calls ajax, reading the response will do stuff with it
[20:40:02] <Codaraxis> Is there a nicer way to pass the necessary information to myFunc than to do the following?   $("foo").blur( function() { var target = $(this); myFunc( target ) });
[20:40:14] <freebir> shoky, 			if(valid){    $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { $('html').append(response). window.location.replace("www.claro.com.br"); });  return false;  }else{    return valid;
[20:40:28] <freebir> shoky, can you please show me how ?
[20:40:30] <shoky> freebir:  what's that .  ?
[20:40:46] <shoky> freebir:   function(response) {  window.location.replace("www.claro.com.br");   }
[20:42:00] <shoky> freebir:  and add http://
[20:42:28] <freebir> 			if(valid){    $.post("enviar.php", $('form').serialize(), function(response)  { window.location.replace("http://www.claro.com.br"); $('html').append(response) });  return false;  }else{    return valid;
[20:42:33] <freebir> shoky,
[20:43:12] <shoky> freebir: if it doesn't work, we need to see it. put it on the live site so we can see..
[20:44:23] <cusco> freebir: look how I use ajax: http://ovh.tretas.eu/~cusco/test/a.html
[20:44:26] <shoky> still donno why you need this ajax at all, if you're redirecting.  a regular form submit would do that just fine with a simple redirect from the php
[20:44:57] <freebir> shoky, i know, the redirect came later, he asked that later, it's in here, but the cache is not updated
[20:44:57] <freebir> http://advocaciagg.com.br/claro3/
[20:45:05] <cusco> shoky's answer might be the fast aproach. just use header(location..)
[20:45:06] <cusco> in php
[20:45:14] <freebir> cusco, wont wo
[20:45:18] <freebir> cusco, wont work
[20:45:24] <freebir> I've tryed
[20:45:34] <cusco> why?
[20:45:37] <cusco> ah
[20:45:38] <cusco> yes
[20:45:40] <shoky> freebir: then let us know when it's updated
[20:45:46] <cusco> headers can only be sen't before text
[20:46:15] <cusco> also after header redirection, always terminate the script .. die()
[20:46:28] <cusco> so you cannot sent 'ok inserted in bd' and then redirect
[20:46:38] <cusco> yoou need to redirect before echo, or print
[20:46:46] <cusco> but that is a #php issue
[20:47:01] <cusco> to do it nice in js, look at my ajax example
[20:47:12] <cusco> a.php returns json_encode(stuff)
[20:47:30] <freebir> cusco, no way man
[20:47:33] <cusco> youmay check http://ovh.tretas.eu/~cusco/test/a.php.txt
[20:47:40] <cusco> no way..? ... .. ok!
[20:47:41] <shoky> freebir: ok it works..
[20:48:34] <freebir> shoky, yeah, tks, funny, wont work in my localhost
[20:51:00] <freebir> tks a lot you guys, shoky cusco tks a lot
[20:51:08] <cusco> boa sorte
[20:51:19] <shoky> ^^
[20:51:44] <freebir> cusco, ahah, olha os carasss
[20:51:56] <freebir> so tem brasileiro nessa porra
[21:44:17] <dman7> hello
[21:45:53] <dman7> Anybody know why the jQuery.html() method removes <html> tags when setting HTML of a node?
[22:21:16] <wanderingwonderi> I'm trying to create a mailing list signup form that slides onto the homepage a few seconds after the website loads and slides back off if the user clicks an "x." This is what I have so far... http://jsfiddle.net/8jEtd/1/ Any suggestions?
[22:22:50] <wanderingwonderi> At this point, the form only slides on with a mouse hover... I'd like it to happen automatically... also, I'd prefer that the div is not attached to the right side of the page, but instead slides in like a small, floating window.
[22:37:35] <grafi> wanderingwonderi automatically? when?
[22:37:55] <wanderingwonderi> graft: x seconds after the page loads
[22:39:13] <wanderingwonderi> So, in theory, the user is looking around the website, and a mostly-unobtrusive div element slides out asking them to sign-up for the website's mailing list.
[22:39:36] <grafi> hm
[22:39:48] <grafi> still sounds obtrusive to me
[22:40:07] <wanderingwonderi> well, it is, a bit.
[22:41:31] <grafi> so when the div "magically" shows up
[22:41:52] <grafi> i have to push a close button to get rid of it?
[22:42:47] <wanderingwonderi> or ignore it and continue exploring the site -- or, perhaps it could go away after y number of seconds if the user doesn't enter an email address.
[22:43:07] <wanderingwonderi> right now, I'm just trying to come up with the simplest solution as a proof-of-concept
[22:43:46] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/8jEtd/2/
[22:44:39] <wanderingwonderi> wow, thanks.
[22:44:45] <grafi> no problem
[22:48:26] <grafi> wanderingwonderi why is the email field a textarea o√¥
[22:48:44] <wanderingwonderi> It was originally a comment box :-p
[22:49:15] <grafi> ah ;)
[22:51:39] <grafi> wanderingwonderi http://jsfiddle.net/8jEtd/3/ comes in after 2s, goes out after 2s unless the user click the field
[22:54:15] <wanderingwonderi> That's exactly what I was hoping for.
[22:54:54] <SuperPhly> How do I set the onopen trigger for a websocket if by the time my code sets the action it's already open?
[22:55:01] <SuperPhly> I'm having a race condition.
[22:56:50] <grafi> wohoo race conditions
[22:57:15] <SuperPhly> Is there any way to set the onopen trigger before it connects?
[22:57:34] <grafi> probably maybe i have absolutely no idea :)
[23:13:33] <Codaraxis> Regarding  html( content )  , is there an advisable size constraint on the amount of content to pass into it or a more appropriate function to use for 100+ lines being added?
[23:19:41] <Auctus> i have a button whose css is display:none, and if I call $("#thing").show(); when I load the page, sometimes it shows and sometimes it does not. if I call $("#thing").css("display","inline-block"); it works every time. Why?
[23:29:09] <grafi> Codaraxis i have used html with fairly large portions of html, had no problems with it yet
[23:29:34] <Codaraxis> grafi, Awesome, thanks.
[23:30:34] <grafi> Auctus when .show() gets called is the document fully loaded?
[23:31:17] <Auctus> well its inside $(document).ready(function(){
[23:31:59] <Auctus> wel it's inside a $.getJSON which is inside $(document).ready(), idk if that makes a difference
[23:32:35] <grafi> hm thats probably fine then
[23:35:05] <Auctus> i left it as .css("display","inline-block") since .show() only seems to work 50% of the time for some reason that I don't know.
[23:36:19] <Auctus> docs say "This is roughly equivalent to calling .css('display', 'block'), except that the display property is restored to whatever it was initially. "
[23:37:10] <Auctus> so i guess .show() sometimes just puts it back to display:none, but that doesnt explain why it sometimes works? is the JS happening before the CSS is downloaded and applied? Is that possible? Idk.
