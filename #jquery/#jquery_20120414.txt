[00:05:01] <f0rkn1ght> http://pastebin.com/FibWi8f4 Need to know why updatePosts is undefined in line one after <Script>
[00:19:59] <Arimil> Hm can anyone tell me how to do this: $('#article').val() = $('#article').val().replace(/\[video\](http:\/\/(www\.)?youtube\.com\/watch\?v=([a-zA-Z0-9]+))\[\/video]/g,'[video=youtube;$3]$1[/video]'); apparently you can't assign the value of a textarea to it's contents after using .replace on it :<
[00:23:04] <Arimil> So my question is how to assign the value to a textarea rather than read it.
[00:28:34] <Arimil> http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/
[00:28:38] <Arimil> is an example
[00:29:07] <Arimil> basically clicking the "test" button should replace the video tags
[00:29:12] <Arimil> however it doesn't :<
[00:33:30] <Arimil> nvm got it
[00:35:42] <Arimil> or not
[00:35:43] <Arimil> :\
[00:36:30] <Arimil> http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/1/
[00:38:08] <radiantstatic> I currently have a little code I wrote in my wordpress blog that is currently conflicting with other jquery plugins. looking for a way to solve without digging too far i thought id show you my little snippet and you could tell me if theres something obvious that would conflict? i don't think there is but - http://pastebin.com/J8p717Lf
[00:39:04] <radiantstatic> I'm dumb, figured it out.
[00:40:20] <vl1234> how to check array of 0 length else check the empty r not
[00:40:40] <vl1234> for exp var a ==[" "]
[00:40:46] <vl1234> for exp var a = [" "]
[00:41:53] <Arimil> oh, jsfidle doesn't like onclick events :S
[00:41:55] <Arimil> http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/2/
[00:42:22] <vl1234> here am getting a.length is 1 but i want to charater length of that
[00:43:02] <Arimil> and type >.> http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/3/
[00:46:40] <Arimil> ok this is realy weird now
[00:46:45] <Arimil> the jsfiddle copy works
[00:46:50] <Arimil> however my local one doesn't
[00:47:25] <Arimil> http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/6/ works
[00:48:26] <Arimil> however in my local copy $('#article').html(text) doesn't replace the text
[00:49:13] <Arimil> i've check and text is what I want the new text to be :\
[00:49:23] <Arimil> checked*
[00:53:19] <Arimil> I don't understand it's the same exact code
[00:53:41] <Arimil> if I copy paste it to jsfiddle it works
[00:53:44] <Arimil> if I don't it doesn't
[00:57:39] <Arimil> I've come to the conclusion that for some screwed up reason
[00:57:50] <Arimil> .html() on a textarea doesn't work on this page
[00:58:16] <Arimil> if I change the selector to a random div and put it in that it outputs the right code
[00:58:22] <Arimil> if I change it to the textarea
[00:58:28] <Arimil> the textarea doesn't change
[00:59:01] <Mayazcherquoi> Similar to CSS (#id .class1 .class2), can we do the same in jQuery?
[01:12:19] <Hereisanotherlie> Mayazcherquoi: yep
[01:12:52] <Mayazcherquoi> Hereisanotherlie: So just $('#id .class1 .class2') ?
[01:13:22] <Hereisanotherlie> yep try it out
[01:13:46] <Mayazcherquoi> Hereisanotherlie: Okay, thank you :-)
[01:14:22] <Hereisanotherlie> try something simple like $('#id .cl1 .cl2').hide();
[01:17:00] <Mayazcherquoi> Hereisanotherlie: Ta :-)
[01:17:38] <Hereisanotherlie> np :)
[01:18:09] <Hereisanotherlie> Mayazcherquoi: I'm a big fan of this tutorial btw http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[01:18:15] <Hereisanotherlie> he's a great teacher
[01:18:54] <Mayazcherquoi> Ohk. Thank you for that. :)
[01:20:50] <Arimil> So does anyone know why this wouldn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/kPQag/8/
[01:20:54] <Arimil> this example is working
[01:21:03] <Arimil> however when I use the same code on my page it doesn't work
[01:21:19] <Arimil> if required I can give you access to the page in question temorarily
[01:37:09] <hyperstream> Arimil, link to page?
[01:40:48] <f0rkn1ght> hyperstream, http://pastebin.com/sZbWGv7u mind checking why the ajax works but the php doesnt echo anything
[01:46:07] <hyperstream> one sec
[01:48:29] <hyperstream> friggen phone
[01:49:31] <hyperstream> f0rkn1ght, right so you are posting but sending exid as a GET method
[01:49:42] <f0rkn1ght> hyperstream,  No POST
[01:49:44] <hyperstream> so when you see $_GET its in the url, and when you see $_POST its posted as data
[01:50:09] <hyperstream> f0rkn1ght, on your php page try this: var_dump($_GET);
[01:50:18] <f0rkn1ght> checking
[01:50:20] <hyperstream> f0rkn1ght, and try var_dump($_POST);
[01:50:28] <hyperstream> get will have exid = 5 and your POST will have nothing
[01:50:54] <hyperstream> It f@#$ed me a great many of times when php'ing
[01:51:23] <f0rkn1ght> hyperstream, lol yeah its returning GET
[01:51:25] <hyperstream> f0rkn1ght, when you post data, it normally comes from a <form> browser packages it all up and sends it
[01:51:34] <hyperstream> f0rkn1ght, so you need to set var: "value"
[01:51:40] <hyperstream> or change your POST to GET :)
[01:51:51] <f0rkn1ght> alright checking
[01:52:36] <hyperstream> $_POST becomes $_GET in php, or change the ajax to send a GET method instead of POST, or just keep it the way you have it but us $_GET in php LOL
[01:52:54] <f0rkn1ght> alright got it to return $_POST
[01:52:56] <hyperstream> Or make it POST the data
[01:53:03] <f0rkn1ght> by using data:
[01:53:08] <f0rkn1ght> ^^ :)
[01:53:11] <hyperstream> :)
[01:53:24] <f0rkn1ght> sweet works peachy
[01:53:33] <hyperstream> noice one bru :)
[01:53:59] <f0rkn1ght> is /* */ comments in j/jquery?
[01:54:06] <hyperstream> i just use //
[01:54:11] <f0rkn1ght> sweet
[01:54:17] <hyperstream> Annoying, but im not sure :)
[01:54:30] <hyperstream> shit that ends up // ends up removed shortly after in most cases ahaha
[02:00:57] <f0rkn1ght> hyperstream, wanna checkout these descriptions ive made see if there accurate
[02:01:17] <hyperstream> Sure
[02:01:19] <hyperstream> why not

[02:03:57] <raj> is the recommended way to have a loading gif to just .show() when I want, and then .hide() it?
[02:12:07] <Eviltwin> raj: Typically, yes
[02:12:28] <raj> k
[02:12:37] <raj> I dunno why I expected it'd be something automated
[02:12:42] <raj> that did it anytime there was "waiting"
[02:12:44] <raj> :)
[02:20:36] <guy__> https://gist.github.com/e263a9044ddac11b3f4c is this a bug? (This doesn't work)
[02:20:49] <guy__> The timed animation is ignored.
[02:25:33] <Arimil> hyperstream: nvm I got it by using val instead of html
[02:28:04] <guy> Not sure if my message got through:  https://gist.github.com/e263a9044ddac11b3f4c is this a bug? (This doesn't work) The timed animation is ignored.
[02:28:20] <hyperstream> Arimil, noice
[02:28:54] <hyperstream> guy, its just pretty quite round here atm
[02:32:38] <guy> Error. Cannot reproduce the error.
[02:32:45] <guy> This blows my mind.
[02:33:39] <Arimil> hyperstream: what was really annoying was that for some reason it worked on jsfiddle using .html() or .text() to replace the textarea but on my page the same was not ture
[02:33:42] <Arimil> true*
[02:49:18] <g0rd0n> i have a small problem... i have a click event set on <tr> of a table... however inside that tr i have an icon, and i want to avoid that when clicking on that icon the tr events fires up... is this possible?
[03:01:19] <raj> Eviltwin, are you still around?
[03:02:40] <raj> g0rd0n, check out .not() for your selector
[03:02:45] <raj> ?not
[03:02:45] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[03:03:13] <g0rd0n> raj: just found a solution using stopPropagation bound do the <a> element
[03:03:16] <g0rd0n> works like a charm :)
[03:03:25] <raj> k, great :)
[03:04:10] <Eviltwin> raj: ish
[03:04:17] <Eviltwin> In and out
[03:04:41] <raj> k, so I'll ask :)
[03:08:31] <raj> I've got jQuery-File-Upload plugin (with DropZone option set to true, allowing for files to be drag/dropped onto the browser for upload), and I've got ThreeDubMedia's selection plugin for jquery ( http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drop/demo/selection ). However, when DropZone is set AND ThreeDubMedia's plugin is included, I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'dataTransfer' of null jquery.fileupload.js:723 . This is supposedly because TDM's ...
[03:08:37] <raj> ... plugin modifies the drop event. I'm trying to figure out if this is in fact the case, but I'm not sure what I'm looking for in the source:
[03:08:40] <raj> https://github.com/threedubmedia/jquery.threedubmedia/blob/master/event.drop/jquery.event.drop.js
[03:08:52] <raj> or even https://github.com/threedubmedia/jquery.threedubmedia/blob/master/event.drop/jquery.event.drop.live.js
[03:14:34] <Eviltwin> Can I see the page with both of them?
[03:15:40] <raj> oddly enough, when I put them both on fiddle, there was no issue. I'll have to finish a few things up and I can show you the live site
[03:16:02] <raj> so I guess I'll catch you on your way back "in"? :)
[03:16:19] <Eviltwin> If you're lucky
[03:17:11] <raj> well, hope I am =P
[03:35:04] <raj> Eviltwin, still here?
[03:35:25] <Eviltwin> Not 100%
[03:35:43] <raj> k, well, I've got it up fo ryou
[03:35:48] <raj> omg, that sounded bad
[03:36:00] <Eviltwin> Little bit
[03:36:00] <raj> but if we can solve this, I will probably have it up for you anyway
[03:36:01] <raj> ;)
[03:36:11] <raj> http://68.46.138.78:8080/testdrop
[03:36:24] <raj> just drag your mouse around and you'll see the error
[03:36:38] <raj> error happens when you let go
[03:38:28] <monster-p> HI everyone - I have an issue with .toggle - so, I want to use it on a page, but I have 3 sections that require separate triggers. as it stands, i've hard-coded the show/hide sections as .toggle1, .toggle2, and .toggle3 - but i'd prefer it if there was a more dynamic way.  i'm a total n00b at this, can someone help?
[03:38:49] <raj> monster-p, got some code
[03:38:50] <raj> ?
[03:38:55] <monster-p> sure hold a sec
[03:39:01] <monster-p> thx!
[03:39:52] <Eviltwin> raj: Do you have unminified event.drag and event.drop that you can put here instead?
[03:40:08] <raj> oh, so sorry, didn't realize i did that
[03:40:10] <raj> one sec
[03:41:21] <raj> Eviltwin, updated
[03:42:35] <monster-p> http://codepad.org/07Wyow5Q
[03:43:16] <raj> monster-p, you'll find jsfiddle.net far more useful in troubleshooting
[03:43:19] <monster-p> Is there a better place to paste it to te
[03:43:20] <raj> www.jsfiddle.net
[03:43:23] <monster-p> was just typing that
[03:43:23] <raj> yep
[03:43:25] <monster-p> :)
[03:43:35] <monster-p> i'll do that now
[03:43:38] <raj> that way it's live
[03:47:02] <monster-p> http://jsfiddle.net/aWm84/
[03:47:31] <Eviltwin> raj: Well what you suspected is correct
[03:47:33] <raj> ok, so what do you want to happen?
[03:47:43] <Eviltwin> With the events crossing over
[03:47:54] <raj> hmm k
[03:47:55] <Eviltwin> If you look at the callstack when it errors
[03:48:09] <Eviltwin> fileupload is gettind a drop event that originates in drag/drop
[03:49:04] <raj> right
[03:49:19] <raj> jquery.event.drop-2.0
[03:49:53] <raj> Eviltwin, so what would be the solution?
[03:49:58] <monster-p> So, what I would like is to learn how to make this dynamic.
[03:50:10] <raj> what do you mean by that?
[03:50:19] <monster-p> 1) so i don't have to run inline code
[03:50:25] <raj> like, tell me in lamens terms what you want to happen, looking at your html
[03:50:35] <raj> laymen
[03:50:40] <monster-p> ok so i want to separate the js from the page
[03:50:45] <raj> oh, i see
[03:50:50] <raj> that's good :)
[03:51:19] <monster-p> i want it to show/hide like it's doing, without having to explicitly write it out each time
[03:51:22] <monster-p> :)
[03:51:25] <raj> basically, we're gonna take all your stuff within 'onclick' and put it in the 'Javascript' box
[03:51:38] <monster-p> yeah i know what i *should* be doing‚Ä¶just not sure how to get there
[03:51:38] <raj> one sec
[03:53:39] <Kn|t3> Hi
[03:53:49] <Kn|t3> is there a way to get richtext from browser selection.
[03:53:59] <Kn|t3> Same that copy would give?
[03:54:36] <Eviltwin> raj: I'm thinking the only way is going to be to modify one of these libraries
[03:54:50] <Eviltwin> At least fileupload is binding to the namespace
[03:54:55] <raj> right
[03:55:05] <Eviltwin> But drag/drop is triggering in the global
[03:55:07] <raj> so I don't mind modifying drag/drop
[03:55:18] <Eviltwin> .trigger("drop") -> .bind("drop.fileupload")
[03:56:59] <raj> Eviltwin, that's modifying fileupload though, no?
[03:57:00] <Eviltwin> raj: I think by changing references to drop in drop will fix it
[03:57:19] <Eviltwin> Oh, I'm saying that .trigger('drop') will trigger a listener bound by .bind('drop.fileupload',...)
[03:57:59] <Eviltwin> The first will be changing $.event.special.drop to $.event.special.{something else}
[03:58:41] <Eviltwin> Probably the hijack call on 156
[03:58:51] <raj> monster-p, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/aWm84/2/
[03:58:54] <Eviltwin> That might be all you need to change
[03:59:33] <raj> Eviltwin, in drop-2.0.js?
[03:59:40] <Kn|t3> Still waiting if someone had an idea on how to deal with rich text with ranges and browser selection
[04:00:58] <Eviltwin> raj: Yeah
[04:01:02] <raj> monster-p, i commented it for you http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/aWm84/3/
[04:01:12] <raj> Eviltwin, drop.timer = clearTimeout( drop.timer ); // delete timer    ?
[04:01:29] <raj> that's what I'm seeing as line 156
[04:03:38] <raj> unless you mean $special.drag.hijack(event, "drop", dd)
[04:04:05] <raj> and also, changing $.event.special.drop to something else won't break everything?
[04:04:05] <vl1234> gud even
[04:06:10] <vl1234> i have  var farray = ["20","30","40","50","60"]  ; var sarray = ["20","30","40","50","70"];
[04:07:41] <vl1234> compare this two array and i want the result shout be resultarray = ["","","","","70"]......same value should replace empty
[04:07:48] <vl1234> its possible in jquery
[04:08:26] <Eviltwin> raj: You just need to change references to it
[04:08:29] <vl1234> am used inArray function jquery but it given only 70
[04:08:32] <Eviltwin> Places where "drop" events are generated within that code
[04:09:09] <ijse> ..
[04:09:24] <ijse> anyone?
[04:10:26] <raj> Eviltwin, to be honest, I'm not sure what exactly to do
[04:10:46] <ijse> What is the disadvantage of JQueryUI?
[04:10:46] <raj> change EVERY instance of the word 'drop' to 'selectdrop'
[04:10:47] <raj> ?
[04:11:03] <Eviltwin> They probably don't all need to change
[04:11:11] <Eviltwin> I don't have time to look at this in detail at the moment
[04:11:20] <Eviltwin> But might tomorrow
[04:11:28] <xec> ijse: that's a very general question and therefore impossible to answer. in what sense?
[04:11:30] <raj> I'd really really appreciate that
[04:12:12] <ijse> What is the disadvantage of JQueryUI?
[04:12:18] <xec> ijse: what are your concerns? what are you trying to achieve?
[04:12:29] <raj> ijse, it's a good library, I'm not sure what kinda info you're looking for
[04:12:32] <raj> it's useful
[04:12:46] <raj> a disadvantage is it's large and you'd have to include it to use it, of course
[04:13:01] <ijse> I just want to know what need to concern if I use JQueryUI
[04:13:19] <ijse> any others?
[04:14:12] <ijse> what does it best suit for?
[04:14:24] <raj> whenever you need it
[04:14:27] <raj> what're you looking to do?
[04:14:52] <ijse> create some websites ..
[04:15:10] <xec> sigh
[04:15:23] <ijse> ...
[04:15:56] <ijse> Just want to know more..  I am preparing a PPT about JQueryUI.
[04:16:31] <xec> ijse: i suggest you look at what it can do yourself: http://jqueryui.com/
[04:16:55] <xec> PPT = powerpoint?
[04:18:26] <ijse> yes.. we just call it ppt,, a presentation
[04:19:22] <ijse> I've seen that site many times. but it seems no shortcomings about JQueryUI on it.
[04:19:48] <raj> xec, duh, that's what we in the Biz call it
[04:20:31] <xec> ijse: of course you don't - it says what it can do. if you need something else, jquery ui is not for you. if you don't need what it can do, jquery ui is not for you.
[04:20:59] <ijse> reasonable
[04:22:11] <ijse> Reasonable.. but, I think I still need to tell my listeners what JQueryUI is not suit for..
[04:22:48] <DannyZB> ijse : you're a radio host ?
[04:23:57] <ijse> DannyZB: no..
[04:23:59] <DannyZB> * have a podcast
[04:25:03] <xec> DannyZB: he's making some sort of presentation for some sort of unspecified audience
[04:26:39] <ijse> any way, thank you all. I will do some more google.
[04:33:29] <xec> vl1234: is this what you meant earlier? http://jsfiddle.net/Q6pVH/
[04:36:57] <vl1234> @xec.....
[04:37:04] <vl1234> @xec.....thankzzzzzzzzzzzz
[05:12:40] <raj> does jquery's .last() work with arrays?
[05:12:57] <raj> regular arrays with strings, or whatever
[05:16:07] <dabear> raj: why would you do that? but yeah, it would sorta work
[05:16:15] <dabear> $(["s", 3, 23, 23, "a", 23]).last()[0] //==23
[05:16:48] <raj> dabear, cuz i feel like it'd be cleaner than myarray[myarray.length-1]
[05:16:59] <dabear> nope, it wouldn't
[05:17:46] <raj> $.last() perhaps?
[05:18:07] <raj> doesn't look like it exists
[05:18:41] <dabear> nope
[05:18:46] <dabear> don't do it
[05:21:05] <DannyZB> thats just silly ...
[05:21:44] <DannyZB> you create a jquery object , put a regular array in it , then convert it back to a regular array and get an element out of it ( with .last() )
[05:26:39] <dabear> lol
[05:26:43] <dabear> had to try it
[05:26:45] <dabear> Array.prototype.eq = $.fn.eq;Array.prototype.filter = $.fn.filter;Array.prototype.pushStack = $.fn.pushStack;Array.prototype.set = $.fn.set;Array.prototype.last = $.fn.last;
[05:27:10] <dabear> now ["foo", "bar", "last element"].last() would actually work :p
[05:27:50] <dabear> lame, I know
[05:35:29] <Parhs> hello guys
[05:35:44] <adac> I'd like to resize a textarea on click. any ideas how to do that at best?
[05:36:21] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/aboutus , is there a way to make the slideshow smoother ? increase performance somehow..
[05:37:34] <monster-p> raj - thank you so much!
[05:37:59] <raj> np
[05:38:11] <monster-p> i had to step away for a bit, i just saw the code you wrote - extremely handy
[05:38:21] <raj> do you understand what's going on in the code?
[05:38:24] <monster-p> i'm testing it now
[05:38:41] <monster-p> yeah totally - in layman's terms
[05:38:43] <monster-p> :
[05:39:09] <monster-p> you're looking for any element with a class of .showhide
[05:39:17] <raj> yup
[05:39:26] <monster-p> then you're running the function e
[05:39:33] <monster-p> which targets the next element?
[05:39:38] <monster-p> with a class of toggle
[05:39:42] <raj> no, `e` is an argument for the function
[05:39:56] <raj> javascript has unnamed functions...so that function has no name
[05:40:02] <monster-p> oh ok
[05:40:19] <raj> e.target is the target of your click
[05:40:22] <monster-p> how would i know that.
[05:40:47] <raj> function somename (e) { dosomestuff } <-- that's a named function
[05:40:49] <monster-p> (that the function is unnamed_
[05:40:53] <monster-p> oh ok
[05:40:54] <raj> unna,med just doesn't have 'somename'
[05:41:26] <monster-p> so the unnamed arg in this case does whatever is defined by the next line?
[05:41:31] <monster-p> sorry
[05:41:34] <monster-p> the unnamed function
[05:41:51] <raj> there are no named/unnamed arguments
[05:41:55] <raj> only named/unnamed functions
[05:42:05] <raj> I said `e` was the argument of the unnamed function
[05:42:14] <monster-p> right - i made a mistype
[05:42:21] <monster-p> i meant the function
[05:42:23] <raj> btw, have you ever worked with any programming languages in the past?
[05:42:34] <monster-p> a little here and there
[05:42:41] <raj> k
[05:43:00] <raj> anyway, so anyway, e.target is referring to whatever was clicked
[05:43:01] <monster-p> i'm taking a class right now
[05:43:05] <monster-p> php
[05:43:09] <raj> cool
[05:43:15] <monster-p> just started this week
[05:43:29] <monster-p> so this is great, i really appreciate it.
[05:43:40] <raj> so i then get to the .toggle div by saying .next()
[05:43:57] <monster-p> e.target - so, target is something built into query?
[05:44:00] <monster-p> jquery
[05:44:05] <monster-p> or js
[05:44:09] <raj> I refer to the thing clicked with $(e.target) and then get to the very next element in the page by putting .next() on it
[05:44:14] <raj> monster-p, yes
[05:44:20] <raj> js
[05:44:23] <monster-p> ok
[05:44:40] <monster-p> so you're defining the target of the action?
[05:44:47] <raj> because I already knew the very next element was the .toggle div
[05:44:47] <monster-p> click?
[05:44:49] <monster-p> right
[05:44:51] <raj> yes
[05:44:59] <monster-p> but if i wanted‚Ä¶i could skip to the next one
[05:45:55] <monster-p> ok that's great
[05:50:58] <ak87> Hello,any idea why height() and css('height' not working on IE?
[06:01:43] <Mayazcherquoi> somasin:
[06:14:22] <arphen> hey guys, really noob question but im just starting to get into the whole css thing
[06:14:42] <arphen> if i want to make an element stick to the right edge of its parent, i would use "float:right"?
[06:19:21] <ak87> Depends on what u wanna do.U could do it this way or set position:relative for the parent container and use position:relative/absolute and right:0 for the element.
[06:19:47] <ak87> arphen:
[06:22:34] <arphen> thanks
[06:28:42] <DannyZB> Guys : what are the best places to push a jQuery plugin forward ?
[06:35:35] <brrc> can anyone help me with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/8AvMV/
[06:37:45] <dabear> brrc: fix your syntax issues
[06:38:01] <dabear> line 93 lacks as slash before the star
[06:44:04] <DannyZB> brrc: it's not jQuery code
[06:44:18] <DannyZB> "document.getElementById("map_canvas")"
[06:45:44] <brrc> DannyZB updated
[06:46:19] <brrc> dabear: where exactly ? can't seem to find that star on line 93
[06:47:43] <DannyZB> brrc : you used jsFiddle yet you STILL put "initialize()" in the body
[06:47:50] <DannyZB> jsfiddle already takes over the onload thing
[06:48:04] <DannyZB> remove that from the "body" tag and just put "initialize()" in the bottom of the script
[06:48:36] <dabear> DannyZB: initialize function is not defined
[06:48:41] <dabear> so that wouldn't work
[06:49:14] <DannyZB> yes it would
[06:49:18] <DannyZB> I just checked and -it does-
[06:49:43] <DannyZB> not everything is the same in jsfiddle  .. it does some stuff in the background to load the code
[06:49:55] <dabear> not in this fiddle at least: http://jsfiddle.net/8AvMV/
[06:49:59] <dabear> it is not defined
[06:50:10] <dabear> as there is a syntax error just before the function
[06:50:58] <DannyZB> http://jsfiddle.net/8HFBG/1/
[06:50:59] <brrc> hummm
[06:51:36] <DannyZB> and the other functions aren't even there so it's obvious why they don't work
[06:51:57] <DannyZB> you took over body.onLoad instead of jsFiddle so the function was never loaded
[06:52:55] <brrc> so i just need to load them like you loaded initialize() ?
[06:53:17] <DannyZB> what? they're not even there do whatever you want
[06:53:22] <DannyZB> I just pointed out your error
[06:53:53] <brrc> i would like some help please
[06:54:21] <DannyZB> you're not asking a question you're asking us to write your code for you , thats different
[06:54:43] <brrc> not really...
[06:54:57] <brrc> just to point out what a i doing wrong..
[06:55:40] <brrc> *what am i doing
[06:56:53] <DannyZB> jsFiddle loads all your code onLoad
[06:57:11] <DannyZB> the moment you set that variable to something else the JS code you write there isn't loaded
[07:24:42] <bobbytek3> ? exec 1 + 1

[07:24:49] <bobbytek3> thanks bud!
[07:30:23] <c0d3rg1rl> what would be the best way to extract an 'a href' and wrap it around an 'img' just before the 'a href'? I have: <li><h4>Heading</h4><img src="images/some-img.jpg" /><a href="pdf/some pdf.pdf">Download PDF (xx KB)</a></li> - I need <li><h4>Heading</h4><a href="pdf/some pdf.pdf"><img src="images/some-img.jpg" /></a><a href="pdf/some pdf.pdf">Download PDF (xx KB)</a></li>
[07:38:38] <c0d3rg1rl> I tried this but it's wrong: $("#downloads li img").each(function() { alert($(this).next('a').attr('src')) });
[07:38:48] <c0d3rg1rl> to get the src
[07:39:29] <c0d3rg1rl> fsck, just after posting I realize it must be href instead of src... lol: $("#downloads li img").each(function() { alert($(this).next('a').attr('href')) });
[07:39:40] <c0d3rg1rl> thanks for listening ;-)
[07:39:41] <sgp913> hi everyone, i'm pretty terrible at writing/copy-pasting jquery and was wondering if someone could help. i'm using drupal views and i want to have a div containing an image rise up when it is hovered over. http://jsfiddle.net/BjZ3B/ i'm not sure if the code is anywhere near correct
[07:40:01] <sgp913> basically it's div containing an image within an anchor
[07:40:14] <sgp913> when you hover over it, i want it to raise up a few pixels
[07:54:20] <Iarfen> Hi!!!

[07:59:10] <minna> Hello, i'm learning to use arrays and wan't to run a function for each object in an array of items. Any pointers to where i should start?
[08:00:47] <majd> Hey #jquery - i need to mask the input to an input field, including a time field. maskedinput plugin doesn't support time,  https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput/issues/49  and meio mask is not supported anymore: http://www.meiocodigo.com/projects/meiomask/
[08:00:49] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #49 on jquery.maskedinput (pgherveou; 7m, 1w ago): time mask
[08:01:32] <majd> can someone recommend an alternative?
[08:03:30] <minna> majd: Had the same problem, unfortunately i found no alternative
[08:04:37] <majd> minna: hmmm - that's strange... i think i'll go with meio mask for now. Thanks for letting me know
[08:05:12] <minna> majd: No problem.
[08:05:34] <minna> majd: there was a mootools mask plugin that could do it
[08:06:08] <majd> minna: yeah, but i don't think it's a good idea to load both mootools AND jquery on the same page...
[08:06:40] <minna> majd: No it's really not.
[08:09:31] <coachz> hi

[09:20:35] <faryshta> Is there any function to select a checbox? $("input[type='checkbox']").check(); ?
[09:21:52] <jrockjiggz> :checked
[09:22:12] <jrockjiggz> $('input:checked')
[09:26:01] <toothr> jrockjiggz, no, he wants to change the checkbox's state
[09:26:11] <jrockjiggz> ok
[09:26:52] <toothr> which should be cbox.attr('checked', true);
[09:27:00] <toothr> faryshta, ^
[09:27:02] <jrockjiggz> $('input').attr('checked',true)
[09:43:15] <Tomasso> this expresion works: $("#results input[value!=0]")   but this one $("#results input[value > 0]") doesnt... is there some other syntax for the greater than operator?
[09:44:15] <alexr2> ?selectors@Tomasso
[09:44:15] <bot-t> Tomasso, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1ñ3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[09:44:29] <Tomasso> thanss
[09:44:47] <alexr2> Essentially though, no, you can't do a selector like that
[09:44:58] <alexr2> it's a string, not an integer
[10:00:02] <Bartzy> Can I select an element by a data-* attribute ?
[10:00:14] <alexr2> Bartzy, yes.
[10:00:53] <Bartzy> alex1: Is it extremely slow ? :|
[10:01:16] <alexr2> Just as fast as any other selector i think?  Can't imagine why it would be any slower
[10:02:01] <ThiefMaster> it's as slow as any other argument selector
[10:02:08] <ThiefMaster> i.e. not as fast as selecting by id/class/tagname
[10:02:28] <wardi> would someone give me a hint as to what is going on in the first two lines of https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js
[10:03:02] <ThiefMaster> line 1: it wraps the code in a closure where $ points to the jQuery instance used by django
[10:03:16] <wardi> oh, nevermind I think I've got it
[10:03:19] <ThiefMaster> line 2: it creates a new jquery member function, i.e. to be used in a $(...).actions() way
[10:03:23] <wardi> have to read from the bottom too
[10:03:39] <wardi> ThiefMaster: thanks!
[10:03:57] <ThiefMaster> and whoever wrote that code... wtf
[10:03:58] <ThiefMaster> if (!event) { var event = window.event; }
[10:04:00] <ThiefMaster> why oh why
[10:04:06] <ThiefMaster> as if jquery doesn't do that already...
[10:04:25] <wardi> ThiefMaster: you've lost me
[10:04:41] <ThiefMaster> the guy who wrote that uses cross-browser stuff that is already taken care of by jquery
[10:04:54] <wardi> ah. line 84?
[10:05:15] <ThiefMaster> and 85, too
[10:05:51] <wardi> I think this code was written without jquery initially
[10:06:09] <zekritek> just upload a file
[10:06:17] <zekritek> http://joekuan.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/ajax-a-simplified-version-of-file-upload-form-using-iframe/
[10:06:20] <zekritek> or ...
[10:06:36] <ThiefMaster> yeah, probably
[10:06:45] <zekritek> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[10:07:01] <ThiefMaster> but that kind of code.. i'd except that from php people, not python devs :p
[10:07:06] <ThiefMaster> *expect
[10:07:14] <zekritek> i don't choose jquery so
[10:07:18] <Bartzy> I have 2 jquery objects , I want to get all elements in both objects that are direct children and are li[data-id="28"] . How do I do that? A single one is: $object1.children('li[data-id="28"'). But how do I do 2 objects at once ?
[10:07:56] <zekritek> document.getElementById or http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[10:08:06] <zekritek> just don't chosse jquery
[10:08:10] <zekritek> ;)
[10:08:25] <ThiefMaster> so wth do you want?
[10:08:38] <zekritek> i want js ;)
[10:08:39] <Maino> hi i have a little porblem can some1 help me plx? :>
[10:09:13] <Bartzy> Anyone? :)
[10:09:16] <Maino> http://mitin2.net/darkshadowmystic/ when you click on "Userpanel" in the Navi nothing happens, but it should show the div "#userpanel" :>
[10:09:25] <xec> ?add @ Bartzy
[10:09:26] <bot-t> Bartzy, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[10:10:39] <xec> Bartzy: the idea is that you add one collection to the other and then perform whatever on that
[10:11:06] <Bartzy> xec: So $object1.add($object2).children('li[data-id="28"]') ?
[10:11:19] <xec> right
[10:11:53] <Maino> can someone help me pls? :3 i tried everything and it is not working
[10:14:23] <alexr2> Maino, an id can only appear once on a page
[10:14:35] <alexr2> You have the id as your actual content and as the li nav
[10:14:54] <Maino> one mom i'll change that and try it again thanks!
[10:14:55] <Bartzy> xec: Thank you.
[10:15:04] <wardi> next question re https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js -- is there a way to modify actionCheckboxes (line 4) after this code runs?
[10:15:39] <ThiefMaster> no, you would do so before calling .actions() on a jquery object
[10:16:09] <wardi> ThiefMaster: can I undo the effects of calling it the first time and call it again?
[10:16:40] <Maino> alexr2 i changed the id and it's still now working for me :>
[10:17:25] <wardi> ThiefMaster: like, remove all the functions it added?
[10:19:00] <xec> Maino: still now?
[10:19:23] <Maino> i pasted the code here http://jsfiddle.net/gUpDG/
[10:19:25] <ThiefMaster> won't be easy unless you can safely unbind *all* events from those elements
[10:19:26] <Maino> so yoou can see it better
[10:19:37] <Maino> yep still not working xec :(
[10:19:39] <wardi> ThiefMaster: delete django.jQuery.fn.actions; ?
[10:19:48] <ThiefMaster> well that would break stuff
[10:19:51] <ThiefMaster> but you can replace it
[10:19:57] <ThiefMaster> that would be an easy "fix"
[10:20:02] <wardi> :-)
[10:20:10] <ThiefMaster> then you lose all functionality of it though
[10:20:15] <wardi> I would like to clean up properly if possible
[10:20:17] <ThiefMaster> but if you just want to modify the set, simply do something like this:
[10:20:26] <alexr2> Maino, you didn't specify jquery... it's trying to run mootools
[10:21:03] <ThiefMaster> var tmp = django.jQuery.fn.actions; django.jQuery.fn.actions = function() { return tmp.call(this.filter(...)); };
[10:21:04] <Maino> alexr2 how to fix that? thats in my head tag    ->  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
[10:21:06] <xec> Maino: you can use http://validator.w3.org/ to validate your html, you won't get reliable resuls from javascript (or css) with invalid html
[10:21:22] <alexr2> No i mean in the jsfiddle
[10:21:27] <alexr2> It works in there
[10:22:18] <Maino> yes in the jsfiddle it works for me, too :>
[10:22:28] <Maino> i'll fix the html code one moment
[10:22:42] <wardi> ThiefMaster: that would let me remove things from the set?
[10:22:57] <wardi> (or pretend that they're not there)
[10:23:04] <ThiefMaster> yes, it'd be like adding a custom method in the call chain before actions is called
[10:25:27] <wardi> I'd like to just remove all the .click and .change events it created..
[10:25:51] <wardi> how many .click or .changed callbacks can there be on a single input
[10:26:12] <wardi> does installing a new one replace the old, or do they all get called?
[10:26:26] <Maino> alexr2 sex My HTML code is now valid and it's not working
[10:26:26] <alexr2> They all get called, you can have as many as you want
[10:26:31] <Maino> xec*
[10:27:31] <alexr2> Maino, http://jsfiddle.net/gUpDG/2/
[10:27:41] <alexr2> It works fine...
[10:28:04] <Maino> for me in the jsfiddle, too but not on the page http://mitin2.net/darkshadowmystic/#
[10:28:17] <alexr2> Then it's something else that's causing the issue
[10:28:38] <alexr2> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL custom.js:16
[10:29:05] <Maino> custom.js:16Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[10:29:08] <Maino> yes for me too
[10:29:23] <alexr2> Put the click event inside your document.ready
[10:29:38] <xec> Maino: you can call me sex, it's fine. it's actually my middle name
[10:29:50] <Maino> xD sorry i misstyped it xec
[10:30:15] <Maino> alexr2 http://jsfiddle.net/5wFqK/
[10:30:32] <Maino> and chrome gives me the same error
[10:30:32] <Maino> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[10:30:36] <alexr2> Dude, look on the left... you'll see choose framework.
[10:30:42] <alexr2> It shouldn't be mootools
[10:30:44] <alexr2> select jquery
[10:31:00] <Maino> yes only for the paste
[10:31:30] <xec> Maino: try to put a console.log($("#userpanel1")); as first line of your click function, then you'll see if the click handler actually runs, and what it selects
[10:31:40] <Maino> okay mom
[10:32:11] <xec> you can call me mom, it's fine. it's actually my last name
[10:32:12] <Maino> custom.js:16Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[10:32:15] <Maino> same
[10:32:28] <xec> that's right! my name is sex mom
[10:33:03] <xec> Maino: open the cusom.js file and remove all whitespace at end and start of file
[10:33:08] <alexr2> ^^
[10:33:48] <Maino> it says
[10:33:49] <Maino> []
[10:33:52] <Maino> nothing else o.O
[10:34:23] <xec> its not inside the click handler
[10:35:18] <xec> its at top of file, theres not gonna be anything in DOM matching that ID before document ready. so. put your selectors in the ready event
[10:35:33] <xec> you got it right with .hover() but your .click() is outside for some reason
[10:36:16] <Maino> ok im not an english pro, what should i do now? :x
[10:36:21] <Maino> xec
[10:36:28] <xec> you know what document ready is?
[10:36:42] <Maino> not really
[10:36:59] <xec> http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#Launching_Code_on_Document_Ready
[10:38:07] <Maino> LOOOL its working sec alexr2
[10:38:13] <Maino> xec *
[10:38:26] <Maino> omg yeaaaah
[10:38:35] <Maino> finally
[10:38:36] <Maino> *_*
[10:38:38] <xec> you can call me sec, it's fine. it's actually my first name
[10:38:42] <Maino> xD
[10:39:14] <Maino> you guys are awesome
[10:39:14] <Maino> bye
[10:39:38] <xec> haha, i misread that as Quit: Rage closed
[10:46:09] <aJacom> hi. I'm trying to set the src parameter of an a.image element according to the closest 'h3.post_title a' src it can get, for several a.images. I'm trying with $('.portfolio li a.image').each($(this).attr('src',$(this).closest('h3.post_title a').attr('src'))); but I'm not getting anything. Any tips pls?
[10:47:25] <xec> define "closest"
[10:47:48] <xec> maybe paste a snippet of relevant html?
[10:48:17] <aJacom> xec: one of the siblings..
[10:48:22] <aJacom> OK
[10:48:47] <xec> .closest() will look at ancestors only (like .parents())
[10:49:11] <aJacom> so that's my problem.
[10:49:19] <aJacom> .find maybe?
[10:49:50] <xec> for siblings you might want something like nextAll() see ?nextAll
[10:49:50] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[10:50:06] <xec> or prevAll
[10:51:04] <delaney> is it more performat to create 100 divs at load and hide as needed or clear and create them as you go? (showing only 15 or so at a time)

[11:04:13] <_radu> Hello there. I have an issue when attaching a handler to a 'click' event. The problem is I thought that by binding an action to the 'click' event repeatedly, then the latter handler/action would replace the former, but they seem to sum up, eg: el.click(function(){console.log('foo')}); el.click(function(){console.log('bar')}); -> I get logger both 'foo' and 'bar' upon clicking on the element
[11:04:42] <_radu> Thanks in anticipation for any help
[11:09:50] <shoky> indeed they don't replace each other
[11:12:02] <mike> Hi Ladies and Gents
[11:12:32] <Guest24668> Could anyone tell me if there is anything wrong with this
[11:12:34] <Guest24668> $('#single-dataset-btn').click(function(e) { 		 		 		var selectedMarket = null; 		console.log($selectedMarket); 		 		selectedMarket = $('#marketSelect').val(); 		console.log($selectedMarket); 		 	}
[11:13:06] <shoky> what is $selectedMarket
[11:13:06] <Guest24668> I can't for the life of my figure out why my select option value isn't being set to in #selectedMarket
[11:13:58] <Guest24668> #marketSelect is an option select list
[11:14:13] <shoky> you're not setting any value here
[11:14:20] <shoky> just a local variable..
[11:15:25] <shoky> i didnt ask what #marketSelect is..
[11:15:37] <_radu> Guest24668, the '$' in here doesn't look good: console.log($selectedMarket)
[11:16:00] <Guest24668> oh fml
[11:16:15] <_radu> shoky, thanks for the reply man, I've looked up that behavior in the meanwhile: seems to be the right way events function in js. I've been living in darkness :)
[11:16:28] <shoky> ;)
[11:17:19] <Guest24668> i know the scopes local shoky, thats not the issue, radu pointed out the issues. Mainly I'm a tard :p
[11:17:34] <Guest24668> i guess thats what your get for staring at the code for hours
[11:17:59] <_radu> you like that feeling, don't you? :)
[11:20:52] <Guest24668> don't push me closer to edge radu!
[11:20:58] <Guest24668> <= man on ledge
[11:22:28] <_radu> ok man, take it easy; speak your demands :)
[11:23:11] <_radu> shoky, no really, were you aware of this cumulative event assignment behavior before?
[11:23:47] <shoky> yep
[11:26:40] <_radu> shoky, I see... So what would be a clean approach for repetitive event actions reassignment? something like el.off('click').click(function(){console.log('bar')}); would do?
[11:32:23] <shoky> sure
[11:47:25] <ninjaprecision> Is there a standard way of using jQuery to decide if an element is no longer visible in the window?
[11:49:05] <jrockjiggz> like $('div:visible') ?
[11:50:04] <jrockjiggz> or $('input').is(':visible')
[11:50:24] <jrockjiggz> :hidden viseverca
[11:51:11] <ninjaprecision> I am thinking in terms of scrolling, so if the element is scrolled out of the frame
[11:51:17] <ninjaprecision> then I could make something appear
[11:51:42] <jrockjiggz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-to-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport
[11:51:58] <jrockjiggz> also inview plugin: http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/

[11:55:02] <coachz> Any know a jQuery audio player with playlist and volume control ?
[11:56:20] <Hopsy> hey how can I stop loading my webpage using javascript?
[11:57:51] <jrockjiggz> window.stop() or document.execCommand('Stop')
[11:58:19] <jrockjiggz> use both
[11:58:52] <Hopsy> why both jrockjiggz
[11:58:57] <Hopsy> one is for ie?
[11:59:09] <jrockjiggz> yea execCommand is ie
[11:59:14] <jrockjiggz> but neither work in safari
[11:59:20] <Hopsy> lol
[11:59:38] <Hopsy> I need only window.stop
[12:00:07] <Hopsy> It should be firefox compatibilty
[12:00:11] <Hopsy> and it is
[12:00:15] <Hopsy> so thankss
[12:13:36] <catcher> Hey guys, having problems with prettyphoto in firefox. There's another iframe embed on the page, and it ends up on top of my prettyphoto popup. I've tried a low z-index on my embedded iframe (with position: relative) with no luck. Any ideas?
[12:19:24] <shoky> does that iframe have flash?
[12:28:55] <lyrae> when i alert something and it says [Object object]..how do i look into this object? what it is, etc
[12:30:59] <macmartine> Is there a way to keep the same event from getting bound multiple times?
[12:38:53] <catcher> shoky, can't be positive, but I'm pretty sure it does.
[12:39:54] <catcher> shoky, actually, I can be positive, and it does.
[12:40:02] <shoky> lyrae in firebug or chrome developer tools console , if you console.log() instead of alert()
[12:40:09] <shoky> you can check out the object
[12:40:47] <shoky> catcher i think flash plays on top by default unless the <OBJECT> tag has some WMODE property
[12:40:52] <shoky> set to opaque or transparent
[12:41:43] <catcher> shoky, does the flash element need to be watching for it? Or is that just part of flash? I know youtube does..
[12:42:02] <shoky> the flash plugin watches for it
[12:43:16] <catcher> shoky, it's an embed from another site, so I don't have access to the object itself. Am I SOL in that case?
[12:43:38] <shoky> i dunno ;)
[12:45:14] <lyrae> shoky: ty
[12:51:42] <lyrae> So when i click on an input field, which is inside a td which is inside a tr, i want to select the tr. Is this the right way?a = $(this).parent().parent()
[12:51:47] <lyrae> it works but it just doesnt look right
[12:51:58] <lyrae> the first .parent() is the td, the second is the tr
[12:53:06] <kf420> where do you guys think it's better to include js code - header or footer? and why?
[12:58:02] <jrockjiggz> kf420: header is correc. but in some situations you want your js to load after your content.. depends on what the code does
[12:59:03] <jrockjiggz> kf420: theres lots on google http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?663717-Scripts-in-Head-or-at-end-of-Document-Pros-Cons
[12:59:13] <lyrae> and then to select the table i do table = $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent()     that just looks wrong
[13:00:01] <lyrae> table = $(this).parents().filter('table')[0] did it
[13:01:44] <RPkS> Found an effect on a website I'd like to adapt to a button on my site. On click I want an info field to slide open with text. I'm not sure if it's ok to post the link directly, so I'm asking first.
[13:02:16] <smplstk> RPkS: link away
[13:05:20] <smplstk> kf420: footer seems to be the general trend (just before the closing /body tag)
[13:05:46] <smplstk> kf420: the reason for this is speed, if you look at projects like HTML5 boilerplate, that's what they do.
[13:05:51] <smplstk> kf420: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1013112/where-should-i-declare-javascript-files-used-in-my-page-in-head-head-or-nea
[13:10:52] <kf420> smplstk: thanks. all valid points. it seems the general consensus is it depends on individual situation.
[13:12:47] <smplstk> kf420: correct, if you read that link I posted it goes into a lot of the detail concerning when/why you would do either.
[13:13:28] <smplstk> footer is faster, but sometimes, depending on how a project is structured, you need to have your JS in the <header>
[13:13:45] <smplstk> and the speed gain is pretty minimal.

[13:23:15] <faryshta> Is there any function to select a checbox? $("input[type='checkbox']").check(); ?
[13:23:39] <ThiefMaster> .prop('checked', true)
[13:23:44] <devOlsen> $("input[type='checkbox']").attr('checked',true);
[13:23:49] <devOlsen> err sorry prop
[13:23:56] <Woet> attr will work too
[13:23:58] <ThiefMaster> Dev0n: $('input:checkbox') is shorter
[13:24:05] <ThiefMaster> Woet: not in 1.6.0 i think ;)
[13:24:34] <Woet> ThiefMaster: works in 1.6.4 for me
[13:24:43] <ThiefMaster> yeah, it's only "broken" in .0
[13:24:51] <Woet> jquery doesn't make many non-backward compatible changes
[13:24:55] <Woet> as far as i know
[13:25:10] <ThiefMaster> (it didn't have the fallback to properties when using .attr() for e.g. checked, iirc. that's why 1.6.1 was released shortly after .0)
[13:25:13] <faryshta> Dev0n, ThiefMaster thanks

[13:33:26] <shoky> lyrae you don't need to .filter(), you can just .parents('table')[0]
[13:33:46] <lyrae> shoky: oh. thank you
[13:33:54] <ThiefMaster> why not .closest('table')?
[13:34:11] <shoky> indeed ;>
[13:34:21] <ThiefMaster> that'll always give you only one element, so the [0] is not necessary unless you want the actual DOM node anyway
[13:40:13] <jiggz> hello.. is there a way to merge 2 jquery objs for the same .each() function?
[13:40:28] <jiggz> obj1.extend( obj2 ); ?

[14:35:06] <abnormalex> i did .next('pageID'
[14:35:21] <abnormalex> then I did .next(.page .pageID), which I thought would go to the next class before getting the next ID
[14:37:00] <alexr2> abnormalex, your html doesn't match up the code you wrote, there's no way to test it with what you put in the jsfiddle
[14:38:16] <abnormalex> ok alexr2 now it does
[14:38:17] <abnormalex> http://jsfiddle.net/NWjTT/1/
[14:38:41] <abnormalex> ifyou click on either 'Down'
[14:39:51] <bobbytek3> ? exec 1 + 1

[14:40:02] <bobbytek3> thanks bud!
[14:40:27] <shoky> abnormalex that's not how it works
[14:41:33] <abnormalex> shoky: can you explain how it works?
[14:41:33] <shoky> oh
[14:41:44] <abnormalex> I need to go to the next .page, and get that pages pageID
[14:42:52] <shoky> ok but .next and .nextAll look for siblings of the current element
[14:43:06] <shoky> so it doesn't even look in the next .page
[14:43:31] <abnormalex> so I need to go back to parent?
[14:44:13] <shoky> see http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/NWjTT/2/
[14:44:17] <shoky> that's one way
[14:44:26] <shoky> yeah back to the parent
[14:44:58] <shoky> the '.page' selector in .parent() isn't required in this case
[14:45:19] <abnormalex> awesome thank you very much

[15:00:18] <ZoiX> Hi there :)
[15:02:32] <fotoflo> hey all, any jquery mobile folks? i have a problem with the simplest of click()'s firing twice
[15:02:37] <ZoiX> I'm trying to use .load to load a <div>, and it is working. I have a custom scroll in the content I'm loading, but when I load, the scroll doesn't work it :/
[15:03:21] <ZoiX> Here the website: http://psiquiatrascolombia.org/web/revista/volumen-38-no-1-marzo-2009/    |    Please click on Grace Burbano ‚ÄúUn silencioso grito del alma‚Äù in the sidebar
[15:04:01] <ZoiX> And here the site I'mloading: http://psiquiatrascolombia.org/web/revista/volumen-38-no-1-marzo-2009/nuestra-portada/grace-burbano-un-silencioso-grito-del-alma/   |   the scroll works perfectly
[15:11:18] <shoky> fotoflo just ask
[15:12:07] <fotoflo> is there any reason that $("#submitButton").button().click() would behave differently in jquery mobile (aka get fired twice on click?)
[15:12:47] <blendedbychris> can i send an json object to .data() and have it turn the keys and values to data?
[15:20:01] <fotoflo> oh oh oh, i figured it out --- $(document).bind("pageinit", function(){} runs ever time you load a data-role="page" div‚Ä¶ so my listener was getting added to my element twice.
[15:20:18] <fotoflo> because it was in an inner apge
[15:20:19] <fotoflo> page
[15:26:57] <shoky> blendedbychris donno but why not just have one .data() object set to your json obj
[15:28:27] <toothr> can anyone recommend an autocomplete plugin that does not depend on jquery UI?
[15:37:51] <DubsteppinGreekG> hello.

[17:00:47] <raj> if I do `var myvar=$('<select><option value='abc'>abc</option><option value='xyz'>xyz</option></select>')` can I select one of the options before adding it to the dom (and not altering the original myvar definition)
[17:03:17] <Jon47> raj yes, try this maybe: var myvar=$('<select><option value='abc'>abc</option><option value='xyz'>xyz</option></select>').find('option[value=abc]').prop('selected', true)
[17:03:44] <Jon47> but if you know which one you want to be selected, why not just declare it that way in your html string
[17:05:31] <jerry_> guys i am trying to replace <h3>+Expand</h3> to <h3>-Expand</h3>
[17:05:39] <jerry_> What function shoulkd i use
[17:08:53] <raj> Jon47, so I can just do mvar.find('option[value='abc']').attr('selected', 'selected') ? (I've never used prop, not sure what the difference is)
[17:10:26] <jerry_> can someone help me with this example..i am trying to replace +Section to -Section when user clicks on it
[17:10:37] <jerry_> http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/5
[17:11:43] <Jon47> raj  prop is designed specifically for accessing and modifying properties of the elements (checked, disabled, selected, etc)
[17:11:47] <Jon47> check out the docs
[17:12:48] <Jon47> those properties are often initially set via HTML attributes in the source, but in a live DOM the property is the correct way to modify them
[17:15:56] <jerry_> can anyone show me how to swap text in this example please
[17:16:03] <jerry_> http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/5
[17:17:39] <Jon47> jerry_ read the docs on jquery ui's accordion method, i'm sure it will give you some ideas
[17:18:05] <jerry_> Jon47: i know how to get accordion working...i am trying to replace piece of text inisde <h3>
[17:19:03] <shoky> raj you can also just $('<select>....</select>').val('abc');
[17:19:44] <Jon47> jerry_:  i understand, but if you read the docs you'll find that the accordion has a lot of options that you're not using - you can bind handlers to the "change" event, for example, or use the "ui-state-active" css class to apply your styles
[17:20:17] <jerry_> Jon47: thanks
[17:20:17] <raj> word
[17:20:17] <caniuse> raj: bond
[17:20:18] <Jon47> it's all there in the docs, read through that stuff first and if you ahve questions after that, then come ask in irc
[17:20:39] <raj> so I can do myvar.val('abc')

[17:57:17] <jenkinsd> A vessel prevails. The dilemma dances.  An incorporate tea cup stumbles next to the contempt man.

[17:57:21] <jenkinsd> A sentence suffers behind the sure drill.  A brown vendor dashes.  Not ngrdly brown but black ass brown.
[17:57:23] <jenkinsd> The integrated packet strikes opposite the spit.  A cry mints the scenery.
[17:57:25] <jenkinsd> Near the lurking nun shifts an unhelpful blade.  The blade then pierces the nun's heart killing her.  How does the psychologist beam?
[17:57:27] <jenkinsd> The cry stretches!  Whatever key purges!
[17:57:29] <jenkinsd> An addict profiles the linked automobile behind the diameter.
[17:57:30] <jenkinsd> When will the humble peanut turn without a dip?  Below, an acquaintance decides each disaster.
[17:57:32] <jenkinsd> When can a tag fool the checked mailbox?
[17:57:33] <merlin1991> the first div contains some image, which aligns to the top, second div is empty, and last div has a single p inside, but that text isn't aligned to the top
[17:57:34] <jenkinsd> The saddening advice parts the vegetarian throughout a designate purple.  The crushed dread gangs the everyday liaison.
[17:57:36] <jenkinsd> When will another groan screen the horrified plastic?
[17:57:38] <jenkinsd> A stress rattles throughout the bat!
[17:57:40] <jenkinsd> The sterling arch starves the domestic opposite of any honest animal.  The appearance decays?
[17:57:42] <jenkinsd> The radical stamps! The daylight ranks the writer throughout the oriental warehouse.
[17:57:44] <jenkinsd> The frog doses a squad against the staring soul.  The blackmail pants around the cuddly box.
[17:57:46] <jenkinsd> Why can't the unspecified prisoner settle an ambient secretary?  A discontinued gown degrades the squeeze.
[17:57:48] <jenkinsd> Before the lifetime noses a discarded biography.  The budget sighs below our water!
[17:57:50] <jenkinsd> The ingenious dominant boxes the passage.  A handbook slashes the traveling cynic.
[17:57:51] <jenkinsd> A fourteen year old scanner assaults the knowledge underneath the longer girl.
[17:57:53] <jenkinsd> Over her pardon mutters the sharp enemy.  Can a lively car cable the severe playground?
[17:57:55] <jenkinsd> The friendship parades in a discipline!  A poem conforms beneath a flower!
[17:57:57] <jenkinsd> The fiddle contents the paranoid.  This orientating collar faints over whatever unpredictable dialect.  The handful advances an alert above the fascist documentary.  The missile smiles!]
[17:57:59] <jenkinsd> Beneath the engine reverts a sung verdict.  An ingredient approaches its attendant in a tough manner.
[17:58:01] <jenkinsd> A spoof burns the constraint around the numerical concern.
[17:58:03] <jenkinsd> What is a peculiar mainframe?  I don't know.
[17:58:05] <jenkinsd> Birds vats the pet above the internal essence. On top of birds interferes a mutual pant. Turds bowl birds after the thesis. Birds migrate! Turds revolt across birds.
[17:58:07] <jenkinsd> Illegal bows. Why won't drugs decline when they are near illegal?  Drugs mature past a partner. Why do drugs farm the farewell effort?
[17:58:09] <jenkinsd> Ban they cry next to the channel. Bans tender a paper spur outside the bigotry. Bans fund the channel opposite a piano. Another vile wife points to my reactionary.
[17:58:11] <jenkinsd> The dubious refund cheats the taste of semen.  Will the wondrous estate punt with a penis? Penis treasures spit. Penis tires spit. Spit trails penis above an eager belt. Spit employs penis next to the noticeable onion.

[17:58:49] <jenkinsd> I spend money.  I kicked a ball.  That manager opened the door.
[17:58:51] <jenkinsd> That gardener washed a car.  Those flight attendants picked a peach.  Those bus drivers ride a bus.
[17:58:52] <jenkinsd> I wore a hat.  That photographer drives a car.  I set an alarm clock.
[17:58:54] <jenkinsd> The numb sheep freezes with the northern servant.  The gutter elaborates?
[17:58:56] <jenkinsd> The lyric orders dog. The wrath opposes a barrier. A dog initializes a substitute editor. Dog forwards a cat beside gibberish.
[17:58:58] <jenkinsd> Our tribe discharges the unsure basket above the charm.  Can a wise behavior graduate after the vehicle?  A degenerate house piles a panic.
[17:58:59] <merlin1991> dang he left
[17:59:00] <jenkinsd> A process cautions the demise.  The degree gradual dashes after a preceding choral.  The carpet explodes under this dealer.
[17:59:02] <jenkinsd> Whatever thrown molecule colors hover above a deadline.  Can the library fault the classic?  My budget indents a strangest glass.  A purge concatenates the still interpreter into the boundary.
[17:59:04] <jenkinsd> Rumina bibbidle people wont answer MY QUESTIONS.
[17:59:06] <jenkinsd> The juvenile toy cases the desperate diagonal.  The volunteer width dodges throughout the feeling kidney.  Should a minor jargon scream with the numeral?
[17:59:08] <jenkinsd> Does each garble ace the drama?   Our frowning festival congests the under ego.  Any silicon bobs outside a bought winter.
[17:59:10] <jenkinsd> A fourteen lion rants before an effect.  The expired discovery composes within the misery.  The vote founds the poorly sectored megabyte.
[17:59:12] <jenkinsd> Reck teck to the heck teck reck
[17:59:14] <jenkinsd> A jungle breaks a jet.  The amended recorder authorizes the thesis.  Should the bundle trek?  Without the scope raves the knife.
[17:59:16] <jenkinsd> The meaningless gibberish shouts.  Whatever lenient leaf pants beneath the lip.

[18:02:38] <merlin1991> since I now have the chance that people actually answer: any ideas why a p inside a right floated div would align itself to the verical center? (no styles apart from float right affect the container div)
[18:02:44] <rmurphey> didn't even realize i still had ops here :)
[18:03:13] <merlin1991> or rather how do I get it back to the top of the container?

[18:05:07] <techouse> man...i just can't get the submit button bound to jquery :/ it simply reloads the page :/
[18:05:50] <hyperstream> techouse, e.preventDefault();

[18:06:22] <techouse> hyperstream: have it
[18:06:29] <hyperstream> techouse, reals?
[18:06:30] <techouse> and return false at the end
[18:06:41] <techouse> wait, i'll pastebin the js

[18:10:35] <jerry_> Jon47?
[18:10:41] <jerry_> Jon47: stil there?
[18:12:43] <merlin1991> hrm, I'm starting some serious headscratching here
[18:12:49] <merlin1991> can't reproduce in jsfiddle
[18:13:10] <shoky> rmurphey!
[18:13:16] <shoky> when's next yayquery ;)
[18:13:25] <techouse> http://jsfiddle.net/PJGvd/1/
[18:14:35] <Jon47> jerry_: ya what's up
[18:14:48] <jerry_> Jon47: i added this but no luck..
[18:14:59] <jerry_> Jon47: `http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/75/
[18:15:03] <techouse> hyperstream, rmurphey: the thing is, i got the form open in a fancybox and that ajax is being called in the success part of another ajax
[18:15:12] <techouse> so dunno, might be messing it up there
[18:15:12] <jerry_> i tried to add icons instead but doesnt seem to be working
[18:17:07] <shoky> techouse
[18:17:37] <Jon47> jerry_: I don't have a lot of experience wiht jquery-ui to be honest, but a few ideas for how to proceed:
[18:17:37] <Jon47>   1. bind a handler to the "change" event on the accordion and within that function, adjust the +/- on the accordion headers
[18:17:37] <Jon47>   2. use pure css, add a pseudo-element :before the headers and use the ui-active-state to set the generated content to "+" or "-"
[18:17:37] <shoky> you're binding the submit inside an if {} block that runs on page load..
[18:18:15] <Jon47> or maybe the way you're doing it makes sense from the standpoint of a jquery-ui user, i can't speak to that, good luck dude
[18:18:33] <jerry_> k
[18:18:48] <techouse> shoky: oh
[18:19:22] <shoky> so it runs once, doesn't bind, and never runs again
[18:19:37] <hyperstream> techouse, maybe use an click event
[18:19:43] <hyperstream> oh nvm, shoky  got it down :)
[18:21:42] <merlin1991> hm I fixed my problem by setting an explicit margin-top, can it be that p elements have some default top margin, or even have margin: auto by default?
[18:21:58] <shoky> lots of things can be lots of things by default
[18:22:21] <techouse> shoky: yea, that was it
[18:22:24] <shoky> conclusion: best not to count on default
[18:22:26] <techouse> thanx<3

[18:27:20] <shoky> you're not following the jqueryui accordion docs
[18:27:25] <shoky> you dont have any <a> tag
[18:27:36] <shoky> in your <h3>
[18:27:58] <jerry_> ok look at this example...

[18:29:32] <shoky> jerry look at your own example with the <a>'s added: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vG8rt/76/
[18:30:03] <shoky> he gets the arrows in the headers by following the docs..
[18:30:25] <jerry_> shoky:where does actual arrow image comes from
[18:30:26] <shoky> i also added the .css resource in jsfiddle
[18:30:33] <shoky> from jqueryui

[19:17:12] <Guevara> hi! how to get html values from "data" in function(data)?
[19:24:08] <lyrae> hi. i basically select an input of type text and copy the object, and display it again on the page under the original. problem is, it copies with whatever text the user typed. I try to clear it but it doesn't work.  doing this: tr.children().eq(0).attr('value', '').css('display', 'none')
[19:24:08] <Guevara> is possible get html from "data" in function(data)?
[19:24:25] <lyrae> ignore the css() part, its because i make it fade in
[19:24:31] <someprimetime> Guevara: if you send back html as data, yes
[19:24:41] <lyrae> howcome it doesnt set the value to '' ?
[19:24:53] <Guevara> yes someprimetime, data is the back value form controller
[19:25:09] <Guevara> and is a form
[19:25:22] <Guevara> i nedd extract the input, td, tr,etc
[19:25:51] <Guevara> instead print the html form in template

[19:45:54] <jrockjiggz> you can also use .parseXML( data ) or set datatype in your ajax to datatype: 'xml'
[19:48:34] <lsone> ah ok
[20:15:51] <avdeveloper> using jQuery, how do I turn xhr.responseText to a JSON object

[21:42:14] <someprimetime> thanks man i've never seen that used before

[21:43:04] <someprimetime> (switched it to off() since i'm using on()) but thanks
[21:43:54] <raj> anton000, what does that mean to "parse" a string as a function?
[22:07:09] <raj> can I simulate a .click() on a hidden element? $('myhiddenelement').click()

[22:23:23] <billygalbreath> ok, so I ha trying to animate many element's background color inside a for loop, and then run this loop inside another loop. Its behaving rather odd, though. The main loop runs fine without the color change effects. And the color change effects work fine inside the main loop as long as the for loop isn't there. Anyone want to take a crack at this and shoot me some advice?
[22:24:17] <devOlsen> depends, do you have a say jsfiddle.net running?
[22:24:22] <devOlsen> or some kind of link?
[22:24:50] <billygalbreath> http://billy.pl3x.net/test/3.php
[22:25:05] <billygalbreath> theres an example with main loop, for loop, and color effects running
[22:25:21] <billygalbreath> 2.php is no colors with for loop.
[22:25:28] <billygalbreath> 1.php is colors, but no for loop.
[22:27:53] <devOlsen> I know this is not realted, and I'm still readying the code.. but is there a reason you added this style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" to your jquery script include in the header?
[22:29:19] <billygalbreath> i didnt write that script. havent even looked at it to be honest.
[22:29:40] <devOlsen> also, is the order in whice you loop over these arrays of importance?
[22:30:31] <devOlsen> like you are looping from top to bottom right now, you could speed it up if you looped the other direction for(var i=100;i--;)
[22:30:49] <devOlsen> that kind of looping is going backwards, but only has to perform one condition check.
[22:30:58] <billygalbreath> i didnt know that
[22:31:09] <devOlsen> might be useful for you since you are looping in a loop ;)
[22:31:53] <billygalbreath> the loop is only there to manipulate more elements per cycle of the main loop
[22:32:10] <billygalbreath> if there's a better way, I'm definitely all ears
[22:32:20] <devOlsen> word. still reading.
[22:33:15] <devOlsen> also why are you using the setTimeout in the populate callback?
[22:33:23] <devOlsen> is that to allow the loop time to finish?
[22:33:35] <billygalbreath> its what creates the main loop
[22:33:43] <billygalbreath> without that it only runs once and stops
[22:33:57] <billygalbreath> basically it calls itself over and over and over
[22:35:48] <devOlsen> here is a crazy idea.
[22:36:10] <devOlsen> so you have these three lines in the loop of populate that point to the same element and sets its html, css and then animates right?
[22:36:38] <devOlsen> whos to say these arnt trying to fire at the same time.. if this indeed is the same element on all three lines, you should chain this together.
[22:36:58] <billygalbreath> its the same element, yes
[22:37:12] <devOlsen> $j('#'+x+'-'+y).html((z=='1')?'0':'1').css('background-color','rgba(40,40,40,1)').animate({backgroundColor:'rgba(0,0,0,0)'},2000);
[22:37:18] <billygalbreath> sets its html value, colors it, and then starts the animation to fade that color back to transparent
[22:37:21] <devOlsen> again, no clue what the results will be.
[22:37:45] <billygalbreath> i'll try that
[22:37:59] <amit_usual> how do i use jquery ui timepicker on dynamic form ... it throws an error inst is undefined
[22:41:58] <billygalbreath> nothing seemed to change at all
[22:43:28] <devOlsen> give me a sec, setting up something I can play with.
[22:44:01] <devOlsen> wait hold on a sec.
[22:44:10] <devOlsen> throwing hundreds of errors
[22:44:19] <devOlsen> line 7 b is not defined.
[22:44:26] <billygalbreath> thats always fun
[22:44:42] <StevenCodes> sup everyone
[22:52:18] <devOlsen> billygalbreath you still there?
[22:52:22] <billygalbreath> yes
[22:52:27] <devOlsen> http://jsfiddle.net/G5LM3/9/
[22:52:48] <devOlsen> that is using a new color animate resource, as well as no rgba.
[22:52:54] <devOlsen> both have troubles with rgba man.
[22:53:02] <devOlsen> not with hex colors however.
[22:53:24] <StevenCodes> there whoever needs it jquery autocomplete example http://www.stevencodes.com/autocomplete-example-php-jquery-mysqli-ajax
[22:53:32] <StevenCodes> yippy
[22:54:32] <billygalbreath> hmm. still pretty jerky over here
[22:54:47] <StevenCodes> damn storming bad
[22:54:48] <StevenCodes> now
[23:03:37] <devOlsen> little faster billygalbreath? http://jsfiddle.net/G5LM3/26/
[23:04:51] <billygalbreath> sadly no. :( is it smooth for you? or does the fade back to black stop half way and then jump into th enext cycle after a short "
[23:04:55] <billygalbreath> hang"
[23:06:03] <devOlsen> http://jsfiddle.net/G5LM3/27/ little more optmizing.
[23:06:08] <devOlsen> it fully fades for me.
[23:06:13] <devOlsen> in firefox.
[23:06:19] <devOlsen> even better looking in  chrome.
[23:06:39] <StevenCodes> Dev0n,  Nice
[23:06:47] <StevenCodes> dev0lsen
[23:06:48] <billygalbreath> hmm
[23:06:59] <billygalbreath> you running a super computer over there? lol
[23:07:11] <billygalbreath> i have an 8 core 3.6ghz amd with 16gb ram and this is still jerky to me
[23:07:24] <StevenCodes> works fine for me and im on a laptop
[23:07:31] <billygalbreath> using chrome 19 on debian OS
[23:07:34] <StevenCodes> depending on how fast its suppose d to be going
[23:07:34] <StevenCodes> lol
[23:07:51] <devOlsen> true
[23:07:53] <devOlsen> http://jsfiddle.net/G5LM3/29/
[23:07:56] <devOlsen> is a speed change in the animate.
[23:08:15] <devOlsen> thus you are going to have to find a fine point of how fast to animate the color and when to start the next group.
[23:08:17] <devOlsen> but
[23:08:36] <StevenCodes> way better
[23:08:39] <devOlsen> no more left to optimize unless you try a different approach, but this logic seems fine.
[23:08:51] <billygalbreath> better.. hmm
[23:08:51] <StevenCodes> do a random hex
[23:08:58] <StevenCodes> and set it when it loads
[23:09:10] <devOlsen> I removed all the scope creep and changed the loopings to only use one condition.
[23:09:15] <billygalbreath> theres no way to start a new group of animations before the first one starts?
[23:09:22] <StevenCodes> hmm
[23:09:38] <billygalbreath> *before the first one stops
[23:09:49] <devOlsen> yes I'm sure.
[23:09:54] <billygalbreath> thats my goal here
[23:10:07] <billygalbreath> like one animation could be 50% faded and another one starts
[23:10:08] <StevenCodes> make the text unselectable using css
[23:10:13] <StevenCodes> slows it down that much mrope
[23:10:33] <billygalbreath> the text will be covered by another div in production, steven
[23:10:39] <devOlsen> http://jsfiddle.net/G5LM3/30/
[23:10:46] <billygalbreath> this is a type of animated "background" for a site i'm doing
[23:11:01] <billygalbreath> but its got to be smoother and less CPU hungry before i move forward with my idea
[23:12:00] <StevenCodes> why are you setting it to use whole body inside the jsfiddle set a default height and width and itll run smooth
[23:12:00] <devOlsen> well you do realize the animate is very cpu hungery and even worse in IE.
[23:12:47] <billygalbreath> so its not wise to use animate all the time like i'm attempting, huh?
[23:13:06] <devOlsen> well to be honest man.
[23:13:12] <billygalbreath> *le sigh*
[23:13:13] <billygalbreath> quantum computing needs to get here faster
[23:13:32] <devOlsen> I would have made a 0 1 animated gif sprite that does this fade effect.
[23:13:32] <StevenCodes> billygalbreath,  not for people without the standards to run it which is about 85% of the world
[23:13:43] <StevenCodes> ^^
[23:13:48] <devOlsen> then use JS to random a class of 0 1 background property.
[23:13:50] <StevenCodes> but will kill loading the page
[23:13:50] <StevenCodes> lol
[23:14:13] <billygalbreath> what steven said ^^
[23:14:14] <billygalbreath> lol
[23:14:20] <billygalbreath> 1920x1080 animated GIF
[23:14:23] <billygalbreath> i could see the hate mail now
[23:14:25] <devOlsen> no no
[23:14:27] <devOlsen> god no
[23:14:29] <StevenCodes> could preload and cache
[23:14:29] <devOlsen> here I will show you
[23:14:30] <billygalbreath> lol
[23:14:33] <StevenCodes> but thats if they keep there cache
[23:14:42] <StevenCodes> hhes talks about making a small one and repeating
[23:14:43] <StevenCodes> it
[23:14:46] <StevenCodes> that might work
[23:14:57] <billygalbreath> hmm
[23:15:05] <devOlsen> yea just a single like 50px x 20 px animated gif
[23:15:05] <StevenCodes> but wont get randomness
[23:15:09] <devOlsen> one side has 0
[23:15:12] <devOlsen> the other has 1
[23:15:19] <devOlsen> then the boxes that will have this gif background
[23:15:23] <devOlsen> is half the width of the sprite
[23:15:26] <billygalbreath> :O!!!!
[23:15:28] <StevenCodes> ah
[23:15:31] <billygalbreath> that WOULD work!
[23:15:31] <StevenCodes> that might work
[23:15:32] <devOlsen> you use a css class to distribute over these spans.
[23:15:37] <devOlsen> that will random the sprite
[23:15:47] <devOlsen> 100% performance increase.
[23:15:50] <devOlsen> ;)
[23:15:55] <StevenCodes> :D
[23:16:02] <StevenCodes> dev, have a site ?
[23:16:03] <billygalbreath> i would kiss you if there wasnt this internet in the way

[23:23:55] <StevenCodes>  lol
[23:29:20] <HorizonXP> hey guys, i have a div with an id of profileView. within that div, there is an img tag that I want to modify the src of
[23:29:39] <HorizonXP> $('profileView > img').attr('src') seems to return undefined
[23:29:51] <HorizonXP> I'm a jquery noob, so i'm sure I'm doing something wrong here
[23:30:01] <devOlsen> $('#profileView > img').attr('src')
[23:30:24] <HorizonXP> ugh, should've seen that
[23:30:27] <HorizonXP> thanks :)
[23:30:30] <devOlsen> np
[23:31:36] <HorizonXP> wait, that didn't work.
[23:31:44] <HorizonXP> that's weird, it should've tho..
[23:32:08] <devOlsen> still an error
[23:32:11] <devOlsen> or just not work
[23:32:24] <HorizonXP> yeah, still says undefined when i alert(...) it.
[23:32:31] <devOlsen> have a link?
[23:32:47] <HorizonXP> yup, http://www.pulsecode.ca/moto/
[23:33:03] <HorizonXP> click the profile part, where it says Ritesh-Kawasaki..
[23:33:08] <HorizonXP> then click Save
[23:33:14] <devOlsen> umm
[23:33:15] <HorizonXP> the alert should pop up there.
[23:33:17] <ruby_on_tails> how can i get the width of a div as the percentage value(the width is specified as 100%) ?
[23:33:25] <devOlsen> the image is not an imediate child of profileView man.
[23:33:36] <devOlsen> > img is false.
[23:33:49] <HorizonXP> agh
[23:33:56] <HorizonXP> my eyes aren't working right, lol
[23:34:00] <devOlsen> $('#profileView div > img').attr('src')
[23:34:02] <HorizonXP> it's probably time for bed soon
[23:34:06] <devOlsen> heh
[23:35:10] <devOlsen> ruby_on_tails var width = ( 100 * parseFloat($('.largeField').css('width')) / parseFloat($('.largeField').parent().css('width')) ) + '%'; ?
[23:35:17] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
