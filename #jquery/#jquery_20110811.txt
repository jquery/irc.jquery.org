[00:00:02] <coldhead> it could be a CSS problem then, quarkimedes
[00:00:13] <coldhead> scrollTo is pretty sensitive about such things
[00:00:26] <coldhead> you know who is gonna help you with this is Cork
[00:00:32] <quarkimedes> is there an easier lib to use?
[00:00:35] <coldhead> because he's a swell guy
[00:00:58] <Cork> scrollTo works well, and as far as i know the only one that exist
[00:01:04] <Cork> never had a problem with it
[00:01:19] <coldhead> quarkimedes: see what i mean? :D
[00:01:24] <webguynow> anyone available to coach me thru sprites, as described on  alistapart
[00:01:25] <coldhead> Cork++
[00:01:40] <Lochlan> like css sprites, webguynow?
[00:01:43] <Lochlan> well
[00:01:47] <Lochlan> to be used in css?
[00:01:51] <webguynow> I think I'm just missing one part of it.... most of the article, I'm following
[00:02:09] <webguynow> yes
[00:02:29] <webguynow> PM's welcome -  if you have a moment
[00:02:35] <Cork> quarkimedes: wasn't with you from the start, whats the problem your seeing?
[00:02:55] <Lochlan> I don't think I've read the article, webguynow
[00:03:01] <Lochlan> but I often use sprites in projects
[00:03:38] <quarkimedes> well i'm not getting the same error anymore
[00:03:44] <quarkimedes> its just not scrolling at all
[00:03:51] <quarkimedes> i've got this thing we are calling a card
[00:04:05] <quarkimedes> and in each card there will be 4 "slides"
[00:04:13] <quarkimedes> and whenyou click the slide it scrolls to the next
[00:04:23] <quarkimedes> from right to left
[00:04:32] <quarkimedes> but i can't get it to scroll at all
[00:04:38] <quarkimedes> and my list goes from bottom to top
[00:05:00] <quarkimedes> his demo works really well
[00:05:27] <Cork> your example misses the scrollTo extension
[00:05:31] <Cork> but i donno why...
[00:06:20] <quarkimedes> what do you mean?
[00:06:24] <webguynow> re: sprites -  I'm wayyyy back to the 1st article, but it's all informative
[00:06:27] <webguynow> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites
[00:07:08] <Lochlan> yeah I just had a quick scan
[00:07:46] <Lochlan> what don't you understand?
[00:08:41] <dr0id> $('input[name^="created_at"], select[name^="created_at"]') <-- can I merge this selector somehow ? the only diff is input and select
[00:08:52] <webguynow> I get the vertical thing - they're just bring the overlay up -  what's the horizontal movement on Hover ?
[00:08:59] <webguynow> why is it needed ?
[00:09:01] <quarkimedes> Cork: no other ideas?
[00:09:11] <webguynow> http://www.alistapart.com/d/sprites/test-3.jpg
[00:09:23] <Lochlan> dr0id, i think what you have there is the best way to do it..
[00:09:38] <dr0id> ok
[00:10:33] <Lochlan> which example are you talking about webguynow?
[00:11:23] <Cork> quarkimedes: have you tried running this outside of jsfiddle?
[00:11:51] <quarkimedes> yeah
[00:11:54] <quarkimedes> thats where i'm running it
[00:11:57] <Cork> cause it looks like it doesn't add the js for scrollTo for some reason, and i can't see why
[00:12:13] <quarkimedes> i'm just running it there so i could show you guys
[00:14:06] <Cork> quarkimedes: i think i found something
[00:14:20] <Cork> are you loading the file from that server or are you hosting it localy?
[00:14:23] <webguynow> Lochlan: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites    hovers  section
[00:14:44] <webguynow> checking out the example with firebug - proof is in the pudding - brb
[00:15:22] <RubyTN> when at least one checkbox is selected, I want to highlight a span the previous div(the previous div has a class of '.folder').  if none of the checkboxes in the div, I want to toggle/remove the the clas.  here is my fiddle so far:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/
[00:16:50] <quarkimedes> Cork: please share
[00:17:01] <quarkimedes> Cork: i'm hosting it locally
[00:17:06] <RubyTN> anybody?
[00:17:36] <Lochlan> webguynow: yeah I had a look, just loading the image on hover with an adjusted Y axis?
[00:17:45] <siovene> Hi again. How can I make a jquery animation so that when I make an element .slideDown, it will push the page down instead of simply appearing on top of other existing elements?
[00:18:15] <Lochlan> is the element have a float?
[00:18:33] <siovene> Lochlan: is the question for me?
[00:18:35] <Lochlan> excuse my poorly constructed sentence
[00:18:36] <Lochlan> haha yeah
[00:18:51] <Lochlan> it should push the content down, as it expands
[00:18:52] <quarkimedes> Cork: were you thinking there was something wrong with the hotlinking
[00:18:54] <siovene> Lochlan: no, the element doesn't have a float
[00:19:13] <Lochlan> does the container it's in have a float?
[00:19:19] <siovene> Lochlan: no
[00:19:23] <Lochlan> weird
[00:19:26] <Lochlan> got a link for us?
[00:20:16] <Lochlan> not absolutely positioned either?
[00:20:20] <siovene> Lochlan: wait I'll show you a screenshot
[00:20:26] <siovene> not absolutely positioned
[00:20:53] <siovene> Lochlan: sorry for the reverse order: http://imgur.com/a/B2Xck
[00:21:03] <siovene> You're looking at AFTER first and then BEFORE :)
[00:21:15] <siovene> the pink box didn't push the content down
[00:21:26] <Lochlan> the container have a fixed height?
[00:21:30] <siovene> yes
[00:21:36] <Lochlan> that'd be it then
[00:21:41] <siovene> thanks! Let me try
[00:21:48] <ximarin> hi, more a javascript-question: i want to calculate smth like amount = 1 + -1; this results in a string 1-1 and not in 0. Why? what am I doing wrong?
[00:21:59] <Lochlan> maybe change height to min-height
[00:22:00] <siovene> fantastic, thanks Lochlan!
[00:22:09] <siovene> right, good idea
[00:22:11] <Lochlan> glad I could help
[00:22:38] <Lochlan> ximarin, google parsefloat parseint
[00:22:40] <Lochlan> might help you
[00:22:58] <Lochlan> 1 + -1? why not 1 - 1 ?
[00:23:14] <amit_usual> How can i report errors in ajax using jsonp
[00:23:21] <ximarin> the 1 and the minus one are vars
[00:23:30] <Lochlan> try doing
[00:23:34] <ximarin> sometimes positive, sometimes negative
[00:23:43] <amit_usual> for a cross domain cal
[00:23:44] <Lochlan> parseInt(1) + parseInt(-1)
[00:23:53] <xec> ximarin: any chance the type of one or more of the vars are strings? :)
[00:23:54] <RubyTN> can anyone please tell me why my second toggleClass function isn't working?  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/
[00:24:31] <ximarin> xec: the vars are also being calculated and they look fine, its the '-' that messes everything up ;p
[00:25:01] <Lochlan> RubyTN, what's the prob?
[00:25:12] <Lochlan> i click billy joel, it collapses, click again, it expands
[00:25:41] <Lochlan> oh
[00:25:45] <Lochlan> expand isnt being added?
[00:26:06] <Lochlan> $(this).toggleClass(".expand");
[00:26:08] <Lochlan> should be
[00:26:10] <Lochlan> $(this).toggleClass("expand");
[00:26:14] <Lochlan> you don't need the .
[00:26:15] <xec> ximarin: well if you end up with "1-1" its because one (or more) of the vars are not numbers, you can check with typeof, and convert with parseInt() like Lochlan said
[00:26:16] <quarkimedes> Cork: i'm guessing you've given up
[00:26:19] <Lochlan> since you're already telling it that it's a class
[00:27:01] <Lochlan> xec, how's typeof work? like if i wanted to check what a variable was
[00:27:26] <xec> Lochlan: just do: typeof variableName
[00:27:31] <Lochlan> console.log(typeof myvar)
[00:27:33] <Lochlan> cool
[00:27:34] <Lochlan> didn't know
[00:28:12] <xec> Lochlan: there are some caveats though, arrays are reported as objects for instance
[00:28:20] <Lochlan> ok, sure
[00:28:24] <Lochlan> ive noticed
[00:29:17] <Lochlan> RubyTN: you can also make that first line: $(this).toggleClass("active expand").next().slideToggle("slow");
[00:29:20] <Lochlan> just put them together
[00:29:35] <ximarin> xec: Lochlan: parseInting every single var works... thats what Iove about php...
[00:29:40] <RubyTN> Lochlan:  I can't seem to toggle a class on a span within a parent div that has already had its clas toggled.  Basically i need to toggle the class of div with a class of 'filehover' if any of the checkboxes are checked, else it needs to revert back to its normal state
[00:29:41] <ximarin> thx :)
[00:30:16] <Lochlan> RubyTN, i'd help you but I'm bout to leave work
[00:30:25] <Lochlan> ximarin: good to hear!
[00:30:28] <xec> ximarin: yes, the ambiguity of the + operator is sometimes considered one of the weaknesses of javascript
[00:30:32] <Cork> quarkimedes: i can't get my head around why it's not working...
[00:30:42] <RubyTN> Lochlan:  how can I get the parent level span inside the div to highlight if a box is checked?
[00:31:01] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I am loading some axternal content through PHP file. There is some special carecters in text part of the content. Now problem is when I am tasting it in local server it is shoing special carecters but when at live server, it is showing blocks instead of special carecters.
[00:31:28] <Paveloosha> shoing *showing
[00:31:32] <Lochlan> RubyTN, sorry, clocking off! good luck
[00:31:35] <Lochlan> ill be back here tomorrow
[00:31:37] <Cork> quarkimedes: the googlecode server uses the wrong mimetype so the script won't parse
[00:31:37] <Lochlan> aus time
[00:31:39] <Lochlan> laters
[00:31:42] <Paveloosha> any ideas?
[00:31:44] <bricker> I'm trying to set up draggable… the dragging works okay, but the classes aren't getting automatically assigned to the div's, which I think it causing some issues besides just styling (like revert options not working properly). I tried using "addClasses: true" even though that should be default, with no luck. https://gist.github.com/1139089 any ideas?
[00:31:45] <RubyTN> k, tnx
[00:32:02] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[00:32:12] <Cork> quarkimedes: but i tried changing url, but it still fails, (and the only url i have is for a minimized one)
[00:32:14] <tuxx-> Double_Rainbow all the wayyyy
[00:32:22] <Cork> quarkimedes: http://jsfiddle.net/qPNMe/4/show/light/
[00:32:38] <Cork> quarkimedes: that one should work, and i have no clue why it doesn't
[00:32:53] <Double_Rainbow> everybody go to this link: concorde-travel.mu/dev
[00:33:01] <Double_Rainbow> http://concorde-travel.mu/dev
[00:33:04] <tuxx-> sounds like spam.
[00:33:12] <Double_Rainbow> and tel me why when i do the previous arrow
[00:33:17] <Double_Rainbow> it breaks
[00:33:50] <Double_Rainbow> Discover shanghai -> click on the left arrow (previous)
[00:33:53] <asher^> hi
[00:34:26] <Double_Rainbow> anyone?
[00:34:27] <asher^> if i have a function like $("a").click and i want to limit it only to <a>s inside an element with a particular id, how would i do that?
[00:34:37] <twoface> Hi. I have a table where the rows are sortable. It works fine with the rows that I can see in my view, but when i try to drag some of the rows that are not withing view from start, the helper gets positioned about 200px too high. I can't reproduce in jsfiddle, and it happens even i don't pass any options to .sortable(); Any ideas on what CSS/JS I should look for, that might be culprit?
[00:35:22] <RubyTN> why does this code:
[00:35:24] <RubyTN>     test = $(this).closest('.folder').attr('id');
[00:35:24] <Double_Rainbow> anyone??
[00:35:25] <RubyTN>     alert(test);
[00:35:34] <RubyTN> alert 'undefined'?
[00:35:51] <twoface> RubyTN, because you don't find anything, or the element has no id
[00:35:58] <twoface> the latter, actually
[00:36:37] <quarkimedes> Cork: it doesn't throw an error right? it just doesn't do anything
[00:36:41] <Double_Rainbow> RubyTN: because you touch yourself at nigt
[00:37:31] <austen> Question: I'm using Andreas Lagerkvist's plugin dragToSelect (http://andreaslagerkvist.com/jquery/drag-to-select/#jquery-plugin-source) and I'm trying to do a "multiple drag and select" by preventing deselecting when the control key is pressed while selecting a new area.
[00:38:11] <Double_Rainbow> !ping
[00:38:14] <austen> I've tried passing event data to the onShow: config, but all I get is an 'undefined' error on ctrlKey
[00:38:39] <austen> Any suggestions on how to incorporate this behavior into the plugin? Or how to do this properly?
[00:39:02] <Paveloosha> gnarf, any ideas?
[00:42:41] <RubyTN> twoface:  I'm trying to highlight a span in a div based on whether or not a checkbox within the div is checked:  can you help me out?  here is my fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/
[00:43:25] <twoface> RubyTN, it works fine here
[00:43:28] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: why is your name not three face?
[00:43:50] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, why are you asking stupid questions?
[00:43:57] <austen> Works for me too. :)
[00:44:14] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: because i am still waiting for an answer to my problem
[00:44:26] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, then wait in silence, and stop bugging the rest of us
[00:44:46] <Double_Rainbow> woah woah woah, no need to get all fired up for tha
[00:44:48] <Double_Rainbow> that*
[00:45:00] <twoface> RubyTN, you are trying to highlight the artist name as well? .next() might not be the right method for you
[00:45:21] <twoface> RubyTN, .next() selects the next sibling, not child
[00:45:52] <RubyTN> yes, I am trying to highlicht the title, so how do I highlight it?
[00:45:58] <Double_Rainbow> you remember this scene from "Empire strikes back" where skywalker is hanging there and he uses the force to call Leilia back?
[00:46:06] <Double_Rainbow> this is what i will do
[00:46:17] <Double_Rainbow> TML-prv
[00:46:28] <Double_Rainbow> TML-prv:
[00:47:04] <bricker> are jquery-ui draggable elements styled by default by ui thenes?
[00:47:05] <Double_Rainbow> coldhead:
[00:47:11] <bricker> or should they be?
[00:47:20] <RubyTN> I tried $(this).closest('.folder').toggleClass('highlightselected2');, but it doesn't work either
[00:47:52] <twoface> RubyTN, you can't use .closest('.folder'), as your checkbox is not a child of the .folder
[00:48:19] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I am loading some axternal content through PHP file. There is some special carecters in text part of the content. Now problem is when I am tasting it in local server it is showing special carecters but when at live server, it is showing blocks instead of special carecters.
[00:48:32] <RubyTN> twoface, so is it at all possible to highlight that span in the div at all?
[00:49:27] <RubyTN> twoface: so is it at all possible to highlight that span in the div at all?
[00:50:11] <Double_Rainbow> djQuery:
[00:50:12] <twoface> RubyTN, http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/1/ not pretty, but it works
[00:50:42] <bricker> and now my 'revert' option is reversed… set to 'invalid' but it only reverts on a successful drop…
[00:50:47] <austen> Paveloosha: stupid question, but are your special characters html escaped?
[00:51:17] <RubyTN> twoface: tnx!
[00:51:28] <Double_Rainbow> yeah thanks twoface
[00:51:45] <Double_Rainbow> gnarf:
[00:52:13] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, would you mind not spamming the channel?
[00:52:18] <Double_Rainbow> lemme ask my question again, http://concorde-travel.mu/dev/ when i click the previous areow, it breaks
[00:52:35] <Paveloosha> <austen>, I tried but didnt worked. but everything is working fine in local.. it is not shwing single dots too.. Sorry for the stupid question but I am stucked.
[00:53:04] <Double_Rainbow> its not spam if you cannot use the website
[00:53:13] <Double_Rainbow> its not made for foreign people
[00:54:40] <davidw> hrm
[00:54:42] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, nothing breaks, it just doesn't work - probably because your code for it is commented out
[00:55:01] <davidw> trying to figure out the fastest/most efficient way to find paragraphs that contain only <br> and or blank space...
[00:55:22] <austen> Paveloosha: Default behavior of html is that if it isn't UTF-8 it needs to be escaped. Make sure you're defining the charset in the <meta> seciton of the header and use the html special chars escaping. Also look at php's htmlspecialchars function.
[00:55:33] <davidw> $("p br").parent()... hrm
[00:56:12] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: there is no commented code
[00:56:17] <Double_Rainbow> check again please
[00:56:33] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, don't bs me - it was commented before
[00:57:25] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: ya sorry, i was testing
[00:58:08] <Paveloosha> Austen, I am using UTF-8 but didnt checked for php's htmlspecialchars, thank you for lightening this. Can it be happend if any one copieng texts and putting into database?
[01:00:56] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, your selectors searches the entire site - not just the '.block' you need to show/hide.
[01:01:16] <twoface> and thus hides the first .block it finds (pretty much)
[01:02:40] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: hmmm, lemme try somethin
[01:08:31] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: i changed the code, but its still the same error
[01:08:38] <Double_Rainbow> can you please check again
[01:10:03] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, it is the same code - $('.block:visible:first'); on line 162
[01:10:59] <Double_Rainbow> ya, only one class is name bloc
[01:11:07] <Double_Rainbow> jquery sees that
[01:11:46] <Double_Rainbow> block that is
[01:11:51] <Double_Rainbow> then there is block2
[01:13:47] <twoface> ah, i think i know
[01:13:59] <twoface> if($block2.prev().length) should be if($block2.prev().length > 0)
[01:14:26] <twoface> nah, doesn't make sense
[01:15:36] <twoface> but for some reason, that evaluates to true
[01:16:21] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: that length > 0 did not work
[01:18:25] <Double_Rainbow> the thing is i want to tell jquery that if there is notthing left in the .block class, do nothing
[01:18:41] <Double_Rainbow> AFK
[01:18:57] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, use .prev('.block') instead of just .prev()
[01:21:07] <sasori> can someone tell me what's wrong with my code ? http://jsfiddle.net/87vpc/  when i commented the buttons at the $('div#registerpopup') part..the supposedly hidden divs are hidden but when I uncommented the buttons, the divs appear again on the page :(
[01:21:44] <gnarf> ?js if ( 0 ) { console.log(" is true "); }
[01:21:45] <bot-t> gnarf: undefined
[01:21:56] <gnarf> twoface: note, 0 is false, so length > 0 is pointless
[01:22:07] <twoface> gnarf, i know - i withdrew my statement :)
[01:27:10] <bricker> how do I change the javascript_include_tag :defaults? It's looking for jquery.js but there is no jquery.js
[01:27:15] <bricker> oops
[01:27:17] <bricker> wrong channel
[01:28:16] <blackspotwiggins> bricker, its wrong channel, but config.action_view.javascript_expansions[:defaults]
[01:28:33] <bricker> hey thanks :)
[01:28:41] <blackspotwiggins> or just dont use :defaults
[01:28:50] <bricker> I like that idea better
[01:28:53] <bricker> thanks
[01:30:52] <ribot> hey
[01:31:18] <ribot> other than including the jquery script on a webpage, is there something i need to do to initiate jquery functionality?
[01:31:58] <blackspotwiggins> ribot, no
[01:33:33] <ribot> i'm trying this code a page where jquery is included, but the alert doesn't happen: $(document).ready(function() {alert("Hello world!");});});
[01:33:56] <bricker> my draggable element keeps reverting before the event is rendered on fullcalendar… this plugin is very frustrating
[01:34:37] <bricker> ribot: you have one too many )}; at the end there.. a JS error will prevent the alert from happening
[01:35:07] <Birliban> hi, is there a short way, if i want to select all <td> in a table colum when i click on a <th>? : $("th").click( function() { $('td:nth-child('+($(this).parent().index()+1)+')').css("background-color","red"); });
[01:35:55] <quicksilver> Birliban: that is about as easy as it gets, I think.
[01:35:59] <quicksilver> nth column is fiddly.
[01:36:44] <Birliban> hmm, ok ;-) then it should be... thanks
[01:36:49] <bricker> Birliban: you also give a class to each nth column
[01:36:54] <bricker> if that's an option for you
[01:37:42] <ribot> bricker: thanks for noticing, but still the alert doesn't come when i load the page
[01:37:54] <ribot> after fixing it
[01:38:12] <Birliban> bricker, no, not an option because it must be dynamic...
[01:38:18] <Birliban> but thanks though
[01:38:19] <bricker> okay
[01:38:45] <bricker> ribot: perhaps you aren't including the JS properly?
[01:40:02] <ribot> bricker: i'm including this file (and it exists on the server in the correct location): jquery.js?ver=1.6.1
[01:41:08] <bricker> ribot: where does the alert code exist?
[01:41:28] <ribot> bricker: in the body, while the include is in the header
[01:42:23] <frrril> Hey guys, I'm adding a css class to a div that does not match a prerequisite css class already $("div.project:not(."+$(this).attr("data-label")+")").addClass("projectUnimportant"); works fine
[01:42:35] <frrril> inside that div is also an unordered list containing links
[01:42:43] <frrril> how would I add a class to one of those links?
[01:42:59] <frrril> I thought would just be $("div.project:not(."+$(this).attr("data-label")+")+a").addClass("projectUnimportant"); but that doesn't work
[01:43:01] <siovene> Hi. Is there a channel for jquery-mobile or do questions go here?
[01:44:13] <blackspotwiggins> siovene, read /topic
[01:44:21] <SIDU> coldhead: what's the chatting history for this channel? lost code for: $('[id^="Hpop"]') ?
[01:44:36] <siovene> blackspotwiggins: thanks.
[01:45:08] <bricker> ribot: put the JS in the header… <head><script>$(document).ready(function() { alert('hello world'); });</script></head><body> ...
[01:46:25] <ribot> bricker: actually it worked if i used jQuery() instead of $()
[01:46:37] <bricker> ribot: oh yeah, I forgot that
[01:46:41] <bricker> I missed it too
[01:46:59] <bricker> ribot: you can use a . (period) instead of jQuery… $.(document).ready ...
[01:47:18] <bricker> actually
[01:47:23] <bricker> I guess that shouldn't matter
[01:47:28] <bricker> but at least you got it working
[01:47:47] <gnarf> ?logs @SIDU
[01:47:48] <bot-t1> SIDU, Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[01:48:34] <bricker> frrril: check your double quotes...
[01:48:54] <SIDU> thanks gnarf
[01:49:18] <Bhavesh> Is there some way to get Hex value of a Pixel from an Image if I have its coordinates?
[01:49:57] <gnarf> Bhavesh: not "easily" - at least I'm not aware of a method
[01:50:10] <gnarf> I would think using the image in like canvas would be the only way
[01:50:45] <bricker> is it possible to have javascript perform two things at once? I ask because it's annoying how everything pauses while a draggable element is reverting
[01:51:14] <bricker> it's a neat effect but not worth the waiting, in my opinion
[01:51:48] <Bhavesh> gnarf: User uploads the image > It goes into canvas > and then I get value from that canvas like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667045/getpixel-from-html-canvas ?
[01:52:09] <gnarf> Bhavesh: your guess is as good as mine
[01:52:35] <Bhavesh> gnarf: lol (http://jsfiddle.net/MhVgC/9/)
[01:52:39] <gnarf> bricker: huh?
[01:53:34] <bricker> gnarf: I'm using full calendar with drag/drop, and when I drag an element onto the calendar, the element reverts back to it's spot before the event is rendered on the calendar… I assume this is normal behavior?
[01:53:50] <bricker> if I set revertDuration to 0, the event renders immediately
[01:54:05] <gnarf> bricker: i don't know, but its probably animated, which shouldn't "block" anything really
[01:54:46] <bricker> well that seems to be the case, not sure why though
[01:54:53] <gnarf> bricker: see ?p
[01:54:54] <bot-t1> bricker, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:55:58] <ribot> bricker: thanks for your help :)
[01:56:43] <frrril> I fixed the quotes but that didn't seem to be the problem, this doesn't work either $("div.project:not(." + $(this).attr('data-label') + ")+a").addClass("labelUnimportant");
[01:57:35] <Flobbington> Hi, having some trouble with Kwicks accordion slider. The last list item resizes bigger than the rest, can anyone help?
[01:59:58] <luke_66> HI EVERYONE
[02:00:33] <Narhir> Hi
[02:00:59] <Narhir> I have a question, can I create soemthing like http://uvumitools.com/dropdown.html uvumi dropdown (which is based on mootools in jQuerry?
[02:01:14] <Narhir> I was thinkig about using a superfish but it only "animates in" it doesnt "animates out"
[02:01:22] <Narhir> in taht case it slide in but doesnt slide out....
[02:01:27] <Narhir> please help..
[02:03:25] <jovrtn> frrril: still there?
[02:03:31] <frrril> yeah
[02:04:25] <frrril> Narhir there's any number of jquery dropdown menu plugins that do just that
[02:05:06] <luke_66> a question about jstree, i have some issues with IE(7 and 8): after tree loading, all the non-leaf nodes are open (the tree is loaded from a json data structure, with only one non-leaf node with the "state" object setted to "open" and all the other to "closed"). the same code work properly on ff, opera and safari
[02:05:09] <frrril> jovrtn still here
[02:05:12] <bricker> gnarf: should I just include all the relevant files? there are a lot of them.
[02:05:20] <Narhir> : frrril could you please point me soemthing?
[02:05:27] <Narhir> Im.. so mad after integreating motools + jquerry..
[02:05:36] <Narhir> and in the end making core fucntions of drupal beign disabled..
[02:05:38] <jovrtn> frrril: still having trouble? just curious what $(this) was pointing to in your script
[02:05:38] <gnarf> bricker: minimalistic is best
[02:06:35] <frrril> jovrtn each div has a number of links each with their own data-label custom property
[02:07:03] <frrril> if you click on one of those a function is executed that adds a class to each project classed div that does not have a link with that matches the one clicked
[02:07:27] <frrril> basically a labeling system that greys out any div not that doesn't have a label link with the property of the one clicked
[02:07:39] <frrril> and yes I'm still having my problem, I just don't know js syntax well enough
[02:10:21] <bricker> gnarf: okay, well this shows the behavior that I'm talking about. skip to the bottom of the JS section to see the 'revertDuration' part http://jsfiddle.net/eGMQ6/#run The draggable elements are the black boxes at the bottom, try dragging them into the calendar area
[02:10:38] <seutje> Narhir: Drupal 6 rly wasn't designed to support any other library
[02:10:55] <seutje> 7 should work fine with noconflict
[02:10:59] <bricker> change it to "0" to see that the event render can be immediate
[02:11:09] <gnarf> bricker: thats way too much code for me to try to debug - sry
[02:11:53] <bricker> gnarf: all the stuff at the top doesn't need to be debugged, neither does the CSS, it's just the JS at the bottom that is causing the problem apparently
[02:12:06] <bricker> I just had to include that stuff so the demo worked
[02:13:00] <rethus> i use ui-theme. i have fieldset-labels thats looks pretty nice. Question. can i toggle fieldset vvisible and hidden, but keep the fieldset-label visible, to use it as toggle-button?
[02:13:11] <bricker> well I'm just setting the revertduration to 0, it works kind of so I'll stick with that
[02:21:05] <Mariaa`> would show() show a div with type="hidden"
[02:21:06] <Mariaa`> ?
[02:21:17] <twoface> no
[02:22:16] <seutje> a div with type hidden would always be shown o.O
[02:22:31] <Haprog> there is no such attribute as type for a div..
[02:22:52] <twoface> hah, i just saw type="hidden" and thought input :)
[02:23:07] <seutje> I saw div type="hidden" and my head asploded :(
[02:23:15] <Mariaa`> i mean visibility:hidden
[02:23:18] <Mariaa`> sorry
[02:23:21] <seutje> oh, sure
[02:23:56] <SIDU> how do i select all .class inside this.parent ?
[02:24:14] <ravenzz> ?find @ SIDU
[02:24:15] <bot-t1> SIDU, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[02:24:25] <seutje> actually, I don't think it does
[02:25:13] <SIDU> $(this).parent().$('.tab').hide(); ?
[02:25:24] <SIDU> does not work :D
[02:25:38] <ravenzz> $(this).parent().find('.tab').hide();
[02:25:48] <Haprog> Mariaa`: I think show() only affects the css display property. it would only occupy space but would still be hidden if it was had visibility:hidden (I think). I'm not sure though, but it's easy to try out.
[02:25:49] <SIDU> ok ...
[02:27:21] <SIDU> ravenzz: what about: $(this).parent().find('[id^="tab"]').hide();
[02:27:36] <Mariaa`> Haprog: http://pastie.org/2354831 is this correct?
[02:27:51] <seutje> SIDU: attr selector aren't cheap
[02:28:10] <Mariaa`> and is there a way to find out i have the right jquery file linked to my page?
[02:28:35] <seutje> Mariaa`: why are u using visibility?
[02:28:42] <codecab> can anyone tell me whats up with #javascript ???
[02:28:50] <Mariaa`> seutje:  how can i hide the div then
[02:29:04] <ravenzz> Mariaa` display:none
[02:29:05] <seutje> Mariaa`: display: none
[02:29:08] <ravenzz> lol
[02:29:10] <Mariaa`> oh k
[02:29:14] <seutje> Mariaa`: or opacity if u want it to occupy space
[02:29:22] * codecab asks: why is #javascript set +i ?
[02:29:25] <Haprog> Mariaa`: seems mostly correct, but I'm no expert in jQuery yet. why don't you try it out in jsfiddle (without the php stuff)
[02:29:45] <ravenzz> codecab because you need to have a registered nick to join that
[02:30:18] <Mariaa`> seutje: http://pastie.org/2354831 have a look please and also tell me a way to find out the right jquery file is linked in or not
[02:30:29] <ravenzz> Mariaa` do you know the main difference between display:none and visibility:hidden?
[02:30:37] <Mariaa`> because its wp and has so many jquery files linked
[02:30:39] <seutje> Mariaa`: what do u mean, the right jquery file?
[02:30:48] <Haprog> Mariaa`: what do you mean the right jquery file? you want a specific version to be loaded or what?
[02:30:53] <Kennie> hey, does anyone know if there any libs that make a textfield a 'datefield'? user sees: YYYY-MM-DD, as he starts to enter things in the field they will be entered like this: 2011-2M-DD (not sure how else to call it :))
[02:31:10] <codecab> ravenzz: #javascript Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
[02:31:11] <seutje> what is a jquery file? a file containing jquery core, or some script that depends on jquery?
[02:31:19] <Mariaa`> i mean the jquery needed to execute the show() function
[02:31:26] <ravenzz> codecab i am in.
[02:31:32] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: you still here dude ?
[02:31:37] <seutje> Mariaa`: if it doesn't error out, u got the right one?
[02:31:39] <codecab> ravenzz: but +i is invite only ?
[02:31:59] <Mariaa`> what if it doesn't work
[02:32:08] * codecab ravenzz: invite me ;)
[02:32:31] <ravenzz> yes ok, i told you. you need to identify yourself. you must have a registered nickname on freenode
[02:32:37] <ravenzz> to join that channel
[02:32:45] <seutje> isn't that +R?
[02:32:46] * codecab i have.
[02:32:47] <codecab> i have.
[02:33:24] <ravenzz> than, it is not +i
[02:33:26] * codecab dunno, but +i is invite only :)
[02:33:34] <Double_Rainbow> anyone can help me understand http://concorde-travel.mu/dev/ why when i click the previous arrow, it breaks
[02:33:47] <ravenzz> ok
[02:33:51] <Double_Rainbow> not its not spam if you cannot use the website
[02:33:57] <Double_Rainbow> note*
[02:33:58] <ravenzz> codecab your hostname mask is banned
[02:35:29] <Mariaa`> http://pastie.org/2354860 seutje it doesn't do anything
[02:35:56] <seutje> Mariaa`: ur cake is still in the oven :P
[02:36:03] <ravenzz> Mariaa` the DIV closing tag is wrong
[02:36:11] <ravenzz> </div
[02:36:14] <ravenzz> you miss an >
[02:36:15] <seutje> Mariaa`: when u try to access $('button'), it hasn't parsed the <button> element yet
[02:36:25] <Mariaa`> ravenzz:  no i missed it while pasting
[02:36:31] <seutje> Mariaa`: either put ur scripts at the bottom of the page, or wrap shit in doc.rdy
[02:36:32] <ravenzz> k
[02:36:37] <quicksilver> Mariaa`: you have to put your handlers into a $(document).ready(...)
[02:36:50] <Haprog> Mariaa`: see this http://jsfiddle.net/26mXn/ it doesn't show the contents of the div that has visibility:hidden.
[02:37:04] <Mariaa`> doc.ready comes in the <head> ?
[02:37:29] <ravenzz> Mariaa` look, the problem is that...the script is being executed...before you print the HTML by php
[02:37:35] <ravenzz> than it doesn't work
[02:37:47] <quicksilver> if you use $(document).ready(..) it doesn't matter if it's in the head or not
[02:37:48] <Mariaa`> so it should be there when the body loads
[02:37:51] <ravenzz> so you can place the js after the if statement
[02:37:52] <ravenzz> or
[02:37:55] <quicksilver> but it's often better style to put it in the head.
[02:37:57] <ravenzz> use $(document).ready(..)
[02:37:59] <austen> How can I globally catch a control key hold and change the cursor while the control key is pressed?
[02:38:14] <Double_Rainbow> seutje: seutje my good old friend
[02:38:24] <Double_Rainbow> how are you?
[02:38:54] <ravenzz> Mariaa` <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function(){  /* yourcode */ }) </script>
[02:39:03] <Haprog> you can just use $(function () { /*code here*/ }); instead of $(document).ready(function () { /*...*/ });
[02:39:40] <ravenzz> also i would print that js snippet only "if ( p2_user_can_post() && !is_archive() )"
[02:39:51] <seutje> Mariaa`: allow me to illustrate: http://jsbin.com/azepes/edit
[02:39:56] <seutje> OHAI Double_Rainbow
[02:40:46] <Double_Rainbow> seutje: dude can you help me with http://concorde-travel.mu/dev/
[02:40:59] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, i already answered you
[02:41:17] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: oh hey there, no your method did not work
[02:41:36] <seutje> Double_Rainbow: not a big fan of debugging minified javascripts on a page with 2 versions of jquery in it
[02:41:45] <Double_Rainbow> no wai
[02:41:51] <Double_Rainbow> 2 versions....
[02:42:50] <_dave_h_d> hi all when using jquery post which in inside a function such as saveDetails, is it possible to do this: function (data) { return data }? If not, what is the best way around this?
[02:42:58] <SIDU> how to see: this.parent.next.allChild.hide() ?
[02:43:51] <SIDU> $(this).parent().next().child().hide() ?
[02:44:29] <ignotus> hi, how can I match the first tr of a table that doesn't have "foo" class?
[02:45:30] <hrwath> ignotus, $('table:not(.foo) tr:first')
[02:45:45] <ignotus> hrwath: thanks!
[02:45:55] <SIDU> found :D
[02:45:58] <Double_Rainbow> this: .classname.visible:first < what is this?
[02:46:19] <Double_Rainbow> this: .classname.visible:first < where can i find more information about it?
[02:46:28] <Cork> ?:first
[02:46:28] <bot-t> :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[02:46:42] <Cork> Double_Rainbow: .classname and .visible is just class names
[02:46:45] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, you don't even know how your own code works? :/
[02:46:47] <Douglish> Hello everybody, is possible to prevent click event when clicked to child of element, where click event was bound?
[02:46:48] <Double_Rainbow> .block:visible:last < does this work
[02:46:49] <Cork> if its :visible its something else
[02:46:50] <seutje> Double_Rainbow: my bad, 3 versions
[02:46:55] <seutje> 1.2.1, 1.4.1 and 1.5.1
[02:46:59] <seutje> 1.4.1 seems to get loaded last
[02:47:00] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: no, i took it from stackoverflow
[02:47:06] <quicksilver> hrwath: is that the first tr of every non-foo table, or the first tr of the first non-foo table?
[02:47:06] <seutje> along with the first copy of cycle
[02:47:39] <Cork> quicksilver: first tr from the list of matches
[02:47:45] <hrwath> quicksilver, good point, I think that every
[02:47:57] <quicksilver> I've always wondered that about :first ;)
[02:47:59] <hrwath> oh
[02:48:01] <Cork> quicksilver: so first it finds all tables without the class, then all the tr, then the first from that
[02:48:05] <Mariaa`> ah
[02:48:09] <seutje> oh no wait, that first cycle.js doesn't contain a cycle, just jQuery core again
[02:48:11] <quicksilver> Cork: *nod*
[02:48:14] <Mariaa`> doesn't work on my page
[02:48:22] <Mariaa`> but works on jsfiddle
[02:48:29] <seutje> Mariaa`: what does?
[02:48:43] <Mariaa`> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/26mXn/
[02:49:04] <seutje> Mariaa`: prolly because jsfiddle loads that javascript at the bottom
[02:49:13] <seutje> where in your page did you put your javascript?
[02:49:21] <seutje> <head>?
[02:49:39] <Mariaa`> ok i will put in <head>
[02:49:41] <austen> Changing the cursor when a keydown/keyup event happens: http://ideone.com/V1q68
[02:49:47] <seutje> Mariaa`: what? no -_-
[02:49:53] <austen> How can I do this?
[02:50:00] <seutje> Mariaa`: put it at the bottom, right before </body>
[02:50:09] <seutje> ?g javascript at the bottom @ Mariaa`
[02:50:10] <austen> Trying to change the cursor for a drag to select feature
[02:50:11] <bot-t> Mariaa`, Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site - http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[02:50:18] <quicksilver> Mariaa`: or just put it in $(document).ready()
[02:50:22] <quicksilver> as has been suggested many times.
[02:50:34] <Mariaa`> quicksilver:  its in doc.ready
[02:50:41] <Haprog> it doesn't matter where you put it if you just put it in $(function(){ /*code here*/ }); so it's loaded when the DOM is ready.
[02:50:59] <seutje> Mariaa`: rly? should work then, jsfiddle isn't in a doc rdy though
[02:51:10] <quicksilver> Mariaa`: it's not in document.ready in the jsfiddle you pasted.
[02:51:11] <seutje> Haprog: bottom of page fires faster
[02:51:41] <Haprog> Mariaa`: it should work then if jquery is loaded and you have the correct html and jquery selectors
[02:51:41] <seutje> Haprog: http://jsbin.com/azepes/edit <- note how 3 gets logged before 2
[02:52:21] <Mariaa`> well quicksilver  $(document).ready(function() isn't this doc.ready?
[02:52:31] <Mariaa`> sorry been to query after long time
[02:52:50] <quicksilver> yes, but that's not what the jsfiddle you pasted does.
[02:52:54] <seutje> yea, but in recent versions, u can just pass a function to the jquery function and it'll know u mean doc rdy
[02:53:20] <Mariaa`> http://jsfiddle.net/26mXn/ quicksilver
[02:54:01] <quicksilver> yes, Mariaa`
[02:54:04] <seutje> no doc rdy there
[02:54:10] <quicksilver> there is no document ready in that jsfiddle
[02:54:29] <Haprog> well I made that jsfiddle and pasted it here in the first place
[02:54:32] <seutje> Mariaa`: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/26mXn/1/
[02:54:44] <Haprog> only tested that it works there
[02:55:15] <ravenzz> Mariaa` http://pastie.org/2354926
[02:55:21] <Mariaa`> http://jsfiddle.net/26mXn/2/
[02:55:47] <seutje> why first, there's only 1 in there o.O
[02:56:04] <quicksilver> yes, like that, Mariaa`
[02:56:15] <ravenzz> dunno what locate_template( array( 'post-form.php' ), true ); is going to output
[02:56:56] <seutje> ravenzz: well, it's nested withing the div, so u can just .children('div') instead of .find('div:first'), no?
[02:56:59] <ravenzz> or she should replace find('> div')
[02:56:59] <seutje> within*
[02:57:07] <ravenzz> k
[02:57:12] <seutje> rly? not just children('div') o.O
[02:57:13] <ravenzz> same
[02:57:28] <seutje> why u gotta make it hard on the selector engine? :(
[02:58:21] <ravenzz> because sometimes i forget things :f
[02:58:51] <Mariaa`> thank you ravenzz
[02:58:59] <Mariaa`> thanks quicksilver  seutje
[02:59:09] <ravenzz> anyway i think that you should mark the button with an ID
[02:59:16] <Mariaa`> but i think the jquery file isn't linked
[02:59:24] <Mariaa`> ravenzz:  doesn't work on page
[02:59:47] <ravenzz> fixingthesejquery.com
[03:00:18] <Mariaa`> http://pastie.org/2354899 this is a list of jquery files i have there
[03:00:25] <Mariaa`> so many of them
[03:01:30] <ravenzz> Mariaa` try this code
[03:01:30] <ravenzz> if (jQuery)
[03:01:30] <ravenzz>        alert("Yuppy");
[03:01:32] <Haprog> Mariaa`: you see the first one is jQuery (version 1.4.4 presumably) and rest are just plugins.
[03:01:47] <_dave_h_d> gonne try again :-)
[03:01:48] <_dave_h_d> hi all when using jquery post which in inside a function such as saveDetails, is it possible to do this: function (data) { return data }? If not, what is the best way around this?
[03:02:31] <ravenzz> return to whom?
[03:04:22] <RubyTN> I have a list of items with checkboxes, how can I hide the divs containing the inputs as well as the parent, if it has no remaining children?  here is my code:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/2/
[03:06:05] <Mariaa`> ravenzz:  yuppy the alert works!
[03:06:10] <hooloovoo> RubyTN: if($(container).length == 0) $(container).hide()
[03:06:14] <Mariaa`> Haprog:  jquery is there
[03:06:17] <hooloovoo> I think
[03:06:49] <Haprog> Mariaa`: yes.. that's what I said.
[03:06:58] <ravenzz> Mariaa` and what about
[03:07:03] <Mariaa`> may be its php that makes it so
[03:07:17] <ravenzz> if($)
[03:07:17] <ravenzz>     alert("Yuppy");
[03:07:40] <Double_Rainbow> ravenzz: hey you seem to be very good with jquery rite?
[03:07:55] <ravenzz> Double_Rainbow no. :p
[03:07:57] <hooloovoo> RubyTN: On second thought that won't work. It's if ($(container).children().length == 0) $(container).hide();
[03:08:08] <Mariaa`> ok lemme do that too
[03:08:13] <ravenzz> this is basic logic :f
[03:08:37] <Double_Rainbow> what is :f ?
[03:08:56] <ravenzz> buh an undefined face
[03:09:01] <RubyTN> hooloovoo:  first of all, I need to .remove(), but onclick, I think I need to create an array of all of the checked elements and then loop throgh the array to hide them.  Is this possible?  Her is the test code I'm working with:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/2/
[03:09:26] <ravenzz> Double_Rainbow do you need help?
[03:10:23] <Double_Rainbow> ravenzz: yes with http://concorde-travel.mu/dev/ when i click the previous arrow, it breaks
[03:10:26] <Mariaa`> ravenzz: no alert with ($)
[03:10:34] <ravenzz> ok
[03:10:39] <Mariaa`> but if i have jqeury why not $
[03:10:43] <Mariaa`> strange
[03:10:43] <hooloovoo> RubyTN: Yes it's possible. I'm not sure it's the best solution but it works.
[03:10:45] <ravenzz> then you should replace any $ with jQuery
[03:10:50] <Mariaa`> ok
[03:11:03] <hooloovoo> RubyTN: Don't have time to write the code for you though since i'm at work. Sorry.
[03:11:20] <Mariaa`> jquery(document). ?
[03:11:39] <ravenzz> Double_Rainbow dunno. maybe because you don't have "previous posts"
[03:12:08] <Haprog> Mariaa`: must be correct case jQuery uppercase Q
[03:12:13] <ravenzz> and you aren't handling that case
[03:12:14] <muzone> Hello!
[03:13:03] <ravenzz> Mariaa` http://pastie.org/2354926
[03:13:19] <muzone> How do I go about doing a product zoom similar to http://www.theoutnet.com/product/242067 - where when you click on the product, the right column fades away and is replaced by a zoomed in version?
[03:15:05] <Haprog> Mariaa`: like this http://jsfiddle.net/Haprog/8yfhn/
[03:16:00] <VictorCl2> whats the J stands on Jquery
[03:16:28] <VictorCl2> javascript? xD
[03:18:50] <Mariaa`> thank you so much ravenzz  and Haprog  :)
[03:18:54] <Mariaa`> that worked perfectly
[03:18:57] <Mariaa`> :D
[03:19:11] <ravenzz> great
[03:19:44] <austen> goootit
[03:19:44] <Mariaa`> another thing i wanna ask is that when i have more than one jquery plugins, they seem to conflict, how can i see what cause it?
[03:20:31] <Haprog> Mariaa`: usually when you use jQuery but no other libraries it's aliased to $ so you can use $ instead of jQuery, but in some cases you may have to use jQuery if $ is used bu some other library. see http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[03:21:10] <Haprog> or if you are sure other scripts don't use $ as a global variable you could try setting it yourself first like $ = jQuery and then using $ instead.
[03:21:47] <Haprog> Mariaa`: you would probably need to check the documentation of each plugin you're using.
[03:22:27] <Mariaa`> Haprog:  i have dont that
[03:22:47] <Haprog> what?
[03:25:05] <Mariaa`> sorry i meant i have done that
[03:25:11] <Mariaa`> read the documentation
[03:26:47] <Haprog> You need to be more specific if you want help. I don't think there's muc hgeneral advice for conflicting plugins. You can always try to debug with Firebug or similar.
[03:27:52] <quicksilver> Haprog: no no no
[03:27:55] <quicksilver> don't use $=jQuery
[03:27:57] <quicksilver> use:
[03:28:11] <quicksilver> function($) { ... code which uses $ ... } (jQuery);
[03:28:18] <quicksilver> this trick is in the docs somewhere.
[03:28:32] <Haprog> right. forgot about that.
[03:28:47] <quicksilver> point being that's lexical
[03:28:51] <quicksilver> doesn't affect other subs you call
[03:29:13] <quicksilver> whereas $=jQuery actually changes the global, which might affect other subs which call other subs which are using prototyp
[03:29:21] <Haprog> yup
[03:30:08] <quicksilver> document.ready has this trick 'built-in' in a sense
[03:30:28] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:40:17] <iivvoo> is there a .serialze that produces json in stead of an encoded string?
[03:40:36] <iivvoo> ah.. .serializeArray
[03:40:42] <iivvoo> and then do the encoding step myself.
[03:40:57] <ignotus> hi I have a jQuery object that contains a single element.  I would like to do remove those elements from another jQuery result set, like $('div').removeThese($object) is it possible?
[03:43:52] <quicksilver> ignotus: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[03:45:14] <ignotus> quicksilver: I see, thanks!
[03:45:59] <quicksilver> yw
[03:46:47] * Double_Rainbow looks around for a helpful person
[03:47:36] <quicksilver> just ask your question, if you have one.
[03:47:40] <quicksilver> it's much quicker that way.
[03:48:33] <coldhead> lol quicksilver talking quickness
[03:48:37] <coldhead> i love it <3
[03:48:49] <johanhar> Hi.
[03:48:56] <johanhar> wrong channel sorry
[03:49:07] <quicksilver> yes. Polite greetings are way off limits here.
[03:49:21] <RubyTN> if I have an input, inside of a div that has a class of '.files', how can I get the id of the container div?
[03:50:08] <Double_Rainbow> quicksilver: yes with http://concorde-travel.mu/dev/ when i click the previous arrow, it breaks
[03:50:09] <juha_> someone being polite here?! gtfo!
[03:50:15] <muzone> How do I go about doing a product zoom similar to http://www.theoutnet.com/product/242067 - where when you click on the product, the right column fades away and is replaced by a zoomed in version?
[03:50:23] <Double_Rainbow> i mean the second rows
[03:51:49] <Double_Rainbow> near Air Austral, when you reach the end of the the array, the arrows disappears
[03:51:51] <quicksilver> Double_Rainbow: what are promotion_cycle_1.js and promotion_cycle_2.js?
[03:52:06] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, i told you - use .prev('.block') on line 171 - and you seem to use .next() instead of .prev('.block') on line 172 and 173
[03:52:08] <Double_Rainbow> quicksilver: the slideshows
[03:52:37] <quicksilver> Double_Rainbow: why two ?
[03:52:50] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: i tried it, it blanks the whole thing out
[03:53:05] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, humor me - add it again, and we can take a look at it
[03:53:33] <silv3r_m00n> is it possible to know whether an element is hidden or visible ? (its parent div might be display:none;) ?
[03:53:48] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: there you go, check air austral
[03:54:31] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, you didn't change it in the if()! and you need to use .block, not just block
[03:54:37] <twoface> and you are selecting the wrong classes
[03:54:58] <twoface> please read your own code
[03:55:24] <twoface> http://jsfiddle.net/fLXyd/
[03:55:29] <twoface> gah
[03:55:37] <twoface> http://jsfiddle.net/fLXyd/1/
[03:57:15] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: re-uploaded, please check again
[03:57:39] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, yes - now it doesn't break
[03:57:45] <twoface> you need to apply the changes to all four buttons though
[03:57:49] <Double_Rainbow> twoface: its does not even work
[03:58:08] <twoface> yes it does - there are not previous, and thus clicking previous doesn't do anything
[03:58:39] <Double_Rainbow> by the gods, there are 3 rows there, when i click next, something must happen
[03:58:49] <Double_Rainbow> it must go to the next row
[03:58:55] <twoface> *sigh*
[03:59:06] <twoface> let me spell it out for you
[03:59:18] <twoface> i posted the code that would make your second previous button work
[03:59:22] <twoface> and it seems to
[03:59:44] <twoface> now you need to take what i have been trying to tell you, and apply it to the code for other three buttons as well
[03:59:51] <twoface> before you do that, they will not work
[04:00:30] <Double_Rainbow> ok...
[04:01:30] <Double_Rainbow> omg it works twoface
[04:04:14] <Aquaguy> Hey there ;)
[04:04:39] <Aquaguy> is there any way to get the scroll offset?
[04:05:08] <Aquaguy> I want a sidebar to move down and up while the user scrolls the page (it has to be always visible)
[04:05:35] <twoface> Aquaguy, sure, but you might be better off with a position:fixed div
[04:07:39] <Aquaguy> twoface: I've tried, but using position: fixed it overlaps the header and footer, I want the scrolling to be contained inside a section with id "mainContent"
[04:09:26] <twoface> ah - well, the docs has everything you need then
[04:10:42] <muzone> To do a product zoom like http://www.theoutnet.com/product/242067 - can somebody point me in the right direction?
[04:10:44] <Aquaguy> twoface: I've tried but screenY, pageY and offsetY are all undefined in the $(document).scroll( function (e) { console.log(e) });
[04:10:45] <muzone> I have no idea where to start. Like Dam-Funk said, show me the way! http://soundcloud.com/user4438121/show-me-the-way-d-m-funk-full
[04:11:34] <osmosis_paul> hi
[04:11:35] <osmosis_paul> how can i made an ajax call to the controller when already render the page
[04:11:43] <RubyTN> how can I get this to work:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/2/  ?  I am trying to get the id of the closest div, but can only get the id of the input checkbox
[04:11:54] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[04:11:57] <muzone> come on yall
[04:12:21] <twoface> Aquaguy, .scrollTop() - it was my first hit on google
[04:12:24] <muzone> How do I do a product zoom like on http://www.theoutnet.com/product/242067 ? Where do I start?
[04:12:31] <quicksilver> muzone: you are likely to get good help for specific questions on specific jQuery functions / features.
[04:12:37] <RubyTN> twoface:  any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/2/
[04:12:52] <quicksilver> muzone: you are not likely to get any answer for "I need to solve the following large problem from javascript and have made no attempt to start"
[04:12:52] <muzone> quicksilver: True that, but what specific jQuery functions / features would relate to such a product zoom?
[04:13:24] <quicksilver> muzone: I recommedn the following four-step plan. step (1) learn javascript. step (2) learn jQuery. step (3) make some attempt at solving this yourself. step (4) then come back and ask specific questions.
[04:13:29] <twoface> RubyTN, i can't really see what you are trying to accomplish
[04:13:52] <PatrickBregman> Hi, I have a little problem with my jQuery code. I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mfm9T/2/ and somehow I can't bind the event to the checking/unchecking of the checkbox... I also tried it with .bind() but that didn't work either :(
[04:13:56] <muzone> lmao
[04:13:57] <quicksilver> muzone: your alternative approach of re-asking the same question every 20-30 minutes and getting cross when you don't get an answer *probably* won't work.
[04:14:00] <quicksilver> but who knows.
[04:14:03] <muzone> talk to the hand bitch
[04:14:23] <muzone> what an asshole. the time it took you to lecture me with your bullshit you might as well have helped me.
[04:14:23] <PatrickBregman> entering the show/hide directly in Firebug does work, so that part seems to be ok
[04:14:33] <RubyTN> twoface:  I am trying to remove the parent divs of the input checkboxes that are selected onclick of the submit button
[04:15:06] <twoface> RubyTN, but there are no code where you are trying to - did you post the wrong link?
[04:15:41] <twoface> muzone, but he does have a point - and namecalling really won't help your cause
[04:15:56] <RubyTN> twoface:  make sense?  I can remove the checkbox itself, but can't remove it's container.  sry, wrong link, here is the good link:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/3/
[04:16:21] <RubyTN> twoface:  see it now?
[04:17:22] <twoface> RubyTN, yes - don't use .id, but .attr('id')
[04:17:31] <quicksilver> muzone: in fact, no. helping you would take much longer. My tone might have annoyed you but nonetheless my advice is the right one. This is a channel for programming *help* when people are stuck - not a channel where people write entire programs from scratch for you.
[04:17:35] <quicksilver> PatrickBregman: missing }
[04:17:41] <muzone> would you shut up PLEASE
[04:17:43] <blackspotwiggins> quicksilver++
[04:17:46] <muzone> wait i might as well just put you on ignore
[04:17:54] <muzone> twoface: i understand you're trying to stand up for your friend here
[04:17:54] <quicksilver> PatrickBregman: you don't close the } from the else
[04:17:55] <PatrickBregman> really? that is stupid of me >_< gonna check that now quicksilver
[04:18:08] <quicksilver> actually I don't think twoface has ever met me before today.
[04:18:23] <blackspotwiggins> muzone, would you give me some direction on how to clean my room
[04:18:30] <blackspotwiggins> actually come over and do it!!!11 naoo!!1
[04:18:38] <PatrickBregman> nice :D thanks quicksilver ! Why didn't I see that myself
[04:18:49] <RubyTN> twoface:  tnx
[04:18:55] <twoface> RubyTN, np
[04:19:02] <quicksilver> PatrickBregman: easy to miss these things; there was an error in the Chrome JS console which is what I saw.
[04:19:14] <quicksilver> (other browsers have equivalent JS error places)
[04:19:17] <PatrickBregman> I'm too used to Python, I guess :P
[04:19:25] <PatrickBregman> though Firebug didn't report it
[04:20:32] <muzone> blackspotwiggins: harr harr
[04:20:49] <blackspotwiggins> thats exactly what you sound lik
[04:20:55] <blackspotwiggins> like*
[04:20:55] <muzone> and you sound like a little fag
[04:21:04] <blackspotwiggins> oh wow
[04:21:09] <muzone> thats right
[04:21:09] * twoface just felt the maturity level drop about 20 years
[04:21:31] <muzone> twoface: thats what you say
[04:21:59] <muzone> what i say is, if you're nasty to me, i'll be nasty to you
[04:22:38] <muzone> the fact that i have blunt, hard-hitting punchlines might be the result of 20 years experience in dealing with uptight geeks like yourself
[04:22:46] <muzone> uptight geeks thinking they're better than all others
[04:22:58] <blackspotwiggins> muzone, seems like we are better than you
[04:23:01] <muzone> trying to condescend beginners
[04:23:03] <twoface> *sigh*
[04:23:05] <muzone> "kill them before they grow"
[04:23:18] <muzone> twoface: cat got your tongue now?
[04:23:34] <blackspotwiggins> you deserve to "die" if you cant help yourself in most trivial of problems
[04:23:55] <twoface> I would answer "No, but your mom does" - but I'm not going to that level
[04:24:00] <muzone> i've already solved my problem
[04:24:09] <blackspotwiggins> finally managed to spell "google" ?
[04:24:13] * blackspotwiggins claps
[04:24:35] <kornfield> nice twoface :))
[04:24:38] <kornfield> you should have gone to that level
[04:24:39] <twoface> why can't i just ignore the trolls :/
[04:24:44] <kornfield> would be more "street"
[04:24:46] <PatrickBregman> nice one blackspotwiggins :D
[04:24:50] <coldhead> sometimes they're fun
[04:25:08] <muzone> sometimes they wern't the ones who started it
[04:25:12] <muzone> read the logs coldhead, damn
[04:25:23] <twoface> sometimes, sure - sometimes it's just sad :)
[04:25:26] <coldhead> i read enough, you're the one i saw making personal attacks
[04:25:31] <coldhead> but it's all gonna be fine now
[04:25:35] <coldhead> we can all get along
[04:25:54] <coldhead> we should unite against our common enemies: ignorance and gypsies
[04:26:11] <twoface> uh, and the clowns
[04:26:13] * twoface hates clowns
[04:26:13] <muzone> coldhead: i attacked after being attacked
[04:26:21] <coldhead> never attack
[04:26:34] <coldhead> this is just some dumb awesome irc channel
[04:26:38] <coldhead> don't sweat it
[04:26:42] <muzone> coldhead: i attacked with funny words that don't mean nothing. i was attacked first with a condescending, arrogant attitude that warrants the playing of this song
[04:26:46] * muzone is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/user4438121/we-should-kill-all-azzholez
[04:26:50] <muzone> yeah, i digress
[04:27:01] <muzone> i can dig that coldhead
[04:27:05] <coldhead> thanks for rejoining, muzone
[04:27:11] <muzone> i hope its okay
[04:27:19] <kornfield> yo nice track muzone
[04:27:24] <coldhead> it's all okay
[04:27:24] <juha_> zomg, the ircwars is on again?
[04:27:29] <juha_> i'm betting for the big guy
[04:27:38] <blackspotwiggins> always bet on douk
[04:28:03] <kornfield> man this is some FUNKY SHIT!!!
[04:31:52] <aro> is there an IE hack to make animate() work in 8?
[04:33:40] <sean`> aro, should work
[04:33:44] <sean`> out of the box
[04:33:49] <aro> it doesnt
[04:34:30] <aro> i get this: Line: 7971
[04:34:31] <aro> Error: Invalid argument.
[04:35:03] <aro> this line in jquery.js: 				fx.elem.style[ fx.prop ] = (fx.prop === "width" || fx.prop === "height" ? Math.max(0, fx.now) : fx.now) + fx.unit;
[04:37:25] <coldhead> can we see your code that is provoking that error?
[04:37:41] <aro> sure:http://www.chapmanfamilyalbum.com/pfl/users/login
[04:38:27] <seutje> I don't see no error
[04:38:35] <aro> click on the nav bar
[04:38:39] <aro> one of the menu items
[04:39:00] <seutje> I get an alert and then the menu slides out
[04:39:02] <seutje> no error
[04:39:14] <aro> does the drawer pop out?
[04:39:34] <seutje> yea
[04:39:39] <aro> seutje: are you in IE8?
[04:39:55] <seutje> aro: how would that test an error in IE9?
[04:40:12] <mazzachre> I have a problem setting an image background for an element... From my script file I do $('#myelem').css('background', 'transparent url(images/counter.png) 0 0 no-repeat;'); but nothing happens (it is run from withing document ready) Then when I call that same function from the console in firefox, PLING image loaded and set...
[04:40:15] <aro> whats IE9 have to do with it?
[04:40:18] <seutje> oh wait, u said 8
[04:40:22] <seutje> I can't even read anymore -_-
[04:40:26] <coldhead> :D
[04:40:36] <aro> sleep
[04:40:39] <seutje> time for some serious R&R
[04:40:39] <kornfield> lol
[04:40:40] <mazzachre> I have tried setting the entire image as src in an image from the script and it works nicely, no problem
[04:40:43] <kornfield> cockhead
[04:41:04] <aro> so why do i get that error?
[04:41:18] <kornfield> i didnt mean it like that coldhead but you gotta admit the two names bear striking resemblance:-)
[04:41:28] <coldhead> aro: where in the code is the bit about butts?
[04:41:57] <coldhead> which file
[04:42:02] <aro> it is in http://www.chapmanfamilyalbum.com/pfl/js/jquery/lib/suckerpunch.js
[04:42:04] <RubyTN> twoface:  I am now able to remove the div that contains the input.  I am having trouble removing the parent div with the class of '.folder' if it contains no inputs.  Any idea how to accomplish this?  here is my fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/4/
[04:42:26] <aro> line 67
[04:42:34] <Lochlan> hey it's RubyTN, you're still going!
[04:43:30] <coldhead> aro: there's some weird crap in that suckerpunch code about an IE7fix
[04:43:41] <aro> yeah thats not it.. i tried disabling all those
[04:43:46] <coldhead> my guess is that has something to do with it
[04:43:56] <coldhead> maybe it needs to be not disabled? applied to ie8?
[04:43:57] <coldhead> idk
[04:44:01] <Lochlan> RubyTN, you don't need to put the '.active', just 'active' for the class functions
[04:44:05] <coldhead> but i don't think it's jQuery's problem
[04:44:18] <coldhead> jQuery fully supports ie6 and up
[04:44:26] <aro> does it matter that the element i am trying to animate is absolutely positioned
[04:44:30] <RubyTN> Lochlan: yup, still having a go at it.  Any ideas on how to remove the parent div when there are no more inputs in it:
[04:44:32] <coldhead> suckerpunch isn't uhh great
[04:44:42] <twoface> RubyTN, http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/5/
[04:44:59] <coldhead> aro: it should work the same in all browsers. i think suckerpunch is trying to work around ie in some weird/horrible way
[04:45:24] <coldhead> if you just want to scroll that element down why don't you just do that?
[04:45:27] <RubyTN> twoface:  tnx a bnch!
[04:45:32] <coldhead> ?slidetoggle
[04:45:32] <bot-t> .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[04:45:36] <coldhead> something like that
[04:46:03] <aro> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333911/jquery-animate-doesnt-work-as-expected-in-ie
[04:46:07] <twoface> RubyTN, no problem :)
[04:46:19] <coldhead> well that shuts me up, aro
[04:46:40] <coldhead> but i have spent a lot of time here and have never heard people complain about ie animations
[04:46:55] <Lochlan> good job twoface
[04:47:28] <coldhead> ah okay, so it sounds like you can't animate the position property in IE because IE ignores it
[04:47:59] <mazzachre> Why is there difference in what happens when I run a command from the console and when it is run from a script?
[04:48:02] <twoface> Lochlan, ? :)
[04:48:29] <mazzachre> And more to the point... why does my script not want to set an image backgound?
[04:48:36] <coldhead> mazzachre: the DOM might be in different states, at the console most stuff will already have loaded
[04:48:49] <Lochlan> twoface, good job fixing up RubyTN
[04:49:07] <coldhead> aro: it looks like there's some good advice in that thread for you to try but i stand by my suggestion to ditch suckerpunch
[04:49:11] <mazzachre> coldhead: I run this from inside document ready... So the DOM should be loaded?
[04:49:19] <coldhead> mazzachre: yes
[04:49:32] <coldhead> otherwsie you may be trying to manipulate elements the browser hasn't heard of yet
[04:49:37] <mazzachre> coldhead: I can also set different stuff successfully... Like changing a color
[04:50:08] <coldhead> well it may be something else, i haven't seen your code. but ready() is almost always a good idead
[04:50:13] <coldhead> idea*
[04:50:32] <coldhead> sorry for the death threat
[04:51:05] <mazzachre> Well... My problem... $('#myelem').css('border-color', 'red'); works. yet $('#myelem').css('background', transparent url(images/counter.png) 0 0 no-repeat;'); does not
[04:51:37] <coldhead> mazzachre: does it work if you don't use the background shorthand?
[04:51:52] <coldhead> if you specify the properties individually?
[04:52:08] <coldhead> background-image, background-position blah blah blah
[04:52:25] <mazzachre> OMG.... omg omg omg... Found error... semi-colon after the line...
[04:52:29] <coldhead> or uh if you just remove the ; after no-repeat
[04:52:30] <coldhead> hahah
[04:52:34] <coldhead> yah

[04:52:54] <seutje> oh, u found it already
[04:54:02] <luke_66> I have some issues with JSTree IE(7 and 8): after tree loading, all the non-leaf nodes are open (the tree is loaded from a json data structure, with only one non-leaf node with the "state" object setted to "open" and all the other to "closed"). the same code work properly on ff, opera and safari.
[04:54:22] <luke_66> *JSTree and IE

[05:00:07] <sean`> aro, you should set up a fiddle
[05:02:18] <rethus> is there a way to fit the size of the textarea to the size of its value?
[05:07:16] <aro> set up a fiddle
[05:07:16] <aro> ok
[05:08:07] <sean`> ?g auto resize textarea @ rethus
[05:08:10] <bot-t> rethus, jQuery plugin: 'autoResize'  James Padolsey - http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
[05:09:21] <Birliban> hi, what tooltip plugin would you suggest?
[05:09:27] <tdskate> anybody know of a shorter way on how to do this?
[05:09:27] <tdskate> blocks = $('#main, #header, #highlight');
[05:09:27] <tdskate> height = 0; blocks.each(function(){ height += $(this).height() });
[05:09:29] <ravigehlot> quick question. check this out: www.recruitpreps.com/dev1/ How do I make that menu show over the image below. Both are jquery. thanks.
[05:10:16] <tdskate> need to get the combined height of all elements in "blocks"
[05:11:48] <aro> it works fine in jsfiddle
[05:11:48] <aro> weird
[05:13:00] <ravigehlot> Anybody can help me??
[05:13:50] <twoface> tdskate, not much shorter no - but you could do: var sum = eval($.map($('...'), function(e) { return $(e).height(); }).join('+'); if you really want a one-liner :)
[05:14:27] <twoface> tdskate, otherwise implement your own Array.sum() function for it - that would be prettier :)
[05:15:18] <tdskate> twoface: hmm :) that won't be necessary, i just thought there could be a function already out there that could do what i needed :)
[05:15:36] <twoface> tdskate, not i javascript, unfortunately
[05:15:57] <gnarf> twoface: not in JavaScript that is supported by IE unfortunately ;)
[05:16:11] <gnarf> ?mdc Array.reduce
[05:16:12] <tdskate> twoface: i feel like  $('#main, #header, #highlight').height() should return the combined height...
[05:16:18] <bot-t> gnarf, reduce - MDN Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/array/reduce
[05:16:43] <tdskate> in stead it only returns the first element's height
[05:16:49] <tdskate> instead* :)
[05:16:54] <twoface> gnarf, fair enough :)
[05:16:59] <Aquaguy> When an element's position is set to 'fixed' position() and offset() are the same?

[05:17:14] <bot-t> gnarf: 600
[05:17:22] <twoface> gnarf, js 1.7 will also have list comprehensions, i saw
[05:17:30] <gnarf> if only we could use JS1.8 in browsers ;)
[05:18:33] <Taggnostr2> if I have two arrays, how can I add all the elements of the second in the first?
[05:18:50] <adv_> anyone knows how can i add extension type checking and mime type checking and also verify that uploaded file is an image with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload ?
[05:18:53] <gnarf> Taggnostr2: literal arrays?
[05:19:08] <gnarf> ? [1,2,3,4].concat([5,6,7,8]);

[05:19:24] <gnarf> ?mdc Array.concat
[05:19:26] <bot-t> gnarf, concat - MDN Docs - Returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other array(s) and/or value(s). https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat
[05:19:26] <Taggnostr2> will that add it to the first array or return a new array?
[05:19:50] <gnarf> ?js var a = [1,2,3,4]; a.concat([5,6,7,8]); console.log(a);
[05:19:51] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[05:20:03] <gnarf> ^^^ returns new array
[05:20:20] <Taggnostr2> I guess I could loop through the elements of the second and push them in the first then
[05:20:35] <gnarf> ?js var a = [1,2,3,4]; a = a.concat([5,6,7,8]); console.log(a);
[05:20:36] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[05:20:48] <Aquaguy> Is there any way to get the an objects relative position even if it's set to fixed?
[05:20:52] <Taggnostr2> or that
[05:21:18] <gnarf> ?offset @Aquaguy ?
[05:21:20] <bot-t> gnarf, Monday, 2011-06-27 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110627.log.html
[05:21:24] <gnarf> ?offset
[05:21:25] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[05:21:55] <gnarf> you can compare the offsets of two elements to get the relative position between the two
[05:21:59] * twoface wonders if gnarf is a bot for using bots
[05:22:05] <twoface> botception!
[05:22:17] <gnarf> but i dunno if fixed returns based on "scroll"
[05:22:43] <gnarf> but you can easily add $(window).scrollTop()  and .scrollLeft()
[05:26:23] <Taggnostr2> can I do something like "if (supports_html5_storage() && (var users = localStorage['users']) != null))"?
[05:28:52] <gnarf> Taggnostr2: that "var" is in a dangerous place
[05:29:13] <gnarf> also, use Modernizr for the feature detect
[05:29:29] <Taggnostr2> I need to use 'users' only inside that if, if that's the danger
[05:29:49] <gnarf> then its var users = Modernizr.localStorage && localStorage["users"];  if ( users ) { }
[05:29:55] <rethus> sean`: would this autoresize text area also work for init-time?
[05:30:57] <Taggnostr2> ok
[05:34:18] <sean`> rethus, effing TIAS baby
[05:34:23] <sean`> ?tias @ rethus
[05:34:24] <bot-t> rethus, Try It And See
[05:34:59] <sean`> Taggnostr2, you shouldn't use functions in if statements
[05:35:15] <Taggnostr2> sean`, why not?
[05:35:27] <sean`> Taggnostr2, because you'll have to run them again and again
[05:35:32] <sean`> Just run them once, and save their value
[05:35:44] <Taggnostr2> this should be run only once
[05:35:50] <blackspotwiggins> isn't that for loop conditions?
[05:35:53] <gnarf> hence the Mondernizr suggestion anyway :)
[05:36:00] <sean`> support.localStorage = (function () { return window.localStora... })();
[05:36:15] <sean`> Taggnostr2, yes, but it's not scalable!
[05:36:18] <sean`> A varabile is
[05:36:39] <Taggnostr2> that supports_html5_storage comes from here btw: http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html
[05:37:00] <sean`> Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.
[05:37:03] <sean`> quoted from that page
[05:37:14] <sean`> it uses the best practices gathered from years of experience
[05:37:29] <sean`> there is a reason it's not Modernizr.localStorage ()
[05:37:36] <Taggnostr2> sean`, I'm just trying to figure out if I have the data already in the data storage and read them or request them if they are not there
[05:37:43] <sean`> Ik no
[05:37:45] <sean`> I know*
[05:37:53] <sean`> and I'm just saying something that's on my mind
[05:39:29] <RubyTN> twoface:  apparently  the remove code works too quickly, b/c it doest allow my array to be generated and allow the files to be deleted.  see any ways around this?
[05:39:53] <twoface> RubyTN, what array?
[05:39:57] <sehh> hey people
[05:40:42] <sehh> q: I noticed that jquery UI 1.9 (unreleased) has a "menu" feature, is that for drop-down menus or just sidebar menus?
[05:42:38] <RubyTN> twoface:  In the example:  http://jsfiddle.net/J6bAV/5/, onclick, an array of checked values would be sent to the server to be deleted.  this works if I don't use the code you created for me, but when I use your code, my array of values to be sent to the server is not being created/passed.
[05:42:38] <Narhir> what is the best way to create that kind of "Read more sliding" in jQuery? http://www.mediamind.com/content.aspx?page=executive_management
[05:43:07] <RubyTN> twoface:  any idea how to fix this or find a workaround?
[05:43:30] <twoface> RubyTN, if you submit the form, i don't see why you would want to remove the items at all - isn't the page being reloaded?
[05:44:07] <twoface> Narhir, .slideUp() / .slideDown()
[05:45:26] <RubyTN> twoface:  no, I'm using ror, and the code is used to prevent page refresh.  If they relaod the page, they will get data from the server, but it will be exactly what was previously on the screen
[05:45:30] <Narhir> twoface nothing more?
[05:45:43] <twoface> Narhir, not really - you could settle for .slideToggle() actually
[05:45:49] <RubyTN> by the way, ror stands for Ruby on Rails.
[05:46:09] <twoface> RubyTN, so how is the server alerted? via ajax?
[05:46:10] <aro> why the hell isnt this working
[05:46:18] <gnarf> sehh: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/
[05:47:08] <RubyTN> no, the data is sent to the server like it normally would be
[05:47:30] <twoface> so the page is reloaded, right?
[05:47:35] <gnarf> sehh: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[05:47:51] <sehh> gnarf: I've seen those, but they are all left-to-right menus, not real drop-downs
[05:48:05] <sehh> thats why I am asking, in case there is such a limitation
[05:48:24] <iamtony> Hey all, Does anyone know of any examples of using jQuery templates within a plugin?
[05:48:30] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu ?
[05:49:09] <pr0ton> how do i do this?
[05:49:22] <pr0ton> so i've got a bunch of events fired very quicky... each of them makes an ajax call
[05:49:36] <pr0ton> but i want to induce a delay between 2 such ajax calls (so as to not screw my server)
[05:49:53] <sehh> gnarf: thanks for that, I'll take a look at selectmenu
[05:50:18] <blackspotwiggins> pr0ton, http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#throttle
[05:51:22] <pr0ton> blackspotwiggins, ok
[05:51:25] <gnarf> pr0ton: do you want a delay, or do you want to queue them?
[05:51:47] <gnarf> because throttle/debounce will actually "throw away" events
[05:51:48] <blackspotwiggins> there are also debounce and friends to (ab)use
[05:52:09] <gnarf> ?g benalman debounce
[05:52:11] <bot-t> gnarf, Ben Alman  jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[05:52:20] <pr0ton> gnarf, queue them, but only pick ones which are having a delay of x between them
[05:52:49] <blackspotwiggins> pr0ton, you may need a separate ajax queue
[05:53:09] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[05:53:10] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/
[05:54:33] <sehh> q: are there plans to create a jQuery like we can do with jQueryUI? So we can include a smaller version when we only use 1-2 features?
[05:54:44] <pr0ton> gnarf, i dont want to make all the ajax calls
[05:54:51] <pr0ton> the thing is, i'm using a jquery UI slider
[05:54:53] <sehh> I mean create a custom jQuery .js file
[05:55:00] <pr0ton> so when i'm sliding, it shows way too many events
[05:55:46] <blackspotwiggins> pr0ton, isnt there a change event for slider?
[05:56:08] <gnarf> use the throttle
[05:56:08] <pr0ton> blackspotwiggins, there is, and that sends too many events
[05:56:13] <pr0ton> i'm having a range from 0 to 100000
[05:56:17] <pr0ton> and increment is 100
[05:56:22] <pr0ton> so if i change it to say 90,000
[05:56:26] <blackspotwiggins> change triggers when the slider is stopped
[05:56:28] <pr0ton> there are like 10 events
[05:58:18] <fris> anyone use http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped/ ?

[06:01:12] <Woet> which useless highlight, BlaDe^?
[06:01:20] <Woet> your actual question isnt "has anyone used openid-selector"
[06:01:38] <blackspotwiggins> the answer would be yes
[06:01:41] <blackspotwiggins> someone has used it
[06:01:49] <seutje> BlaDe^: I can say with almost complete certainty that someone has used openid-selector at some time
[06:01:54] <seutje> does this answer your question?
[06:01:57] <Woet> yea, if that is your actual question
[06:01:58] <Woet> then sure
[06:02:02] <Woet> people have used it
[06:02:16] <seutje> even if that use would just be the demo page :P
[06:02:25] <blackspotwiggins> seems super useless tbh
[06:02:50] <seutje> yea, I don't rly get the use
[06:03:17] <blackspotwiggins> it comes bundled with jquery 1.2.6
[06:03:20] <blackspotwiggins> SWEET
[06:03:42] <seutje> heh
[06:03:47] <seutje> last commit was july 6th
[06:04:31] <fantasybei> hey, guys
[06:04:37] * codecab can anybody please ask on #javascript if its possible to remove the banmask for webchat.freenode.net ?
[06:04:51] <Woet> try not using the webchat, codecab
[06:04:57] * blackspotwiggins can you stop using /me all the time?
[06:04:59] <fantasybei> typeof Function.prototype is function, but Function.prototype instanceof Function is false
[06:05:21] <Woet> welcome fantasybei, this is #jquery
[06:05:27] <Woet> not prototype.
[06:05:28] <fantasybei> i know
[06:05:44] <codecab> well, using the webchat is most convenient for me
[06:05:49] <fantasybei> but my question is about javascript, not prototype framework
[06:05:56] <codecab> why shouldnt i use it?
[06:06:06] <blackspotwiggins> codecab, you want to get the #javascript?
[06:06:08] <Woet> codecab: cause you can't enter #jvascript, apparently
[06:06:29] <fantasybei> but jquery is based on javascript,
[06:06:31] <codecab> blackspotwiggins: yes, and ive been there a thousand tmimes
[06:06:34] <codecab> *times
[06:06:40] <codecab> via the webchat
[06:06:58] <gnarf> fantasybei: the prototype object itself isn't an instance
[06:07:01] <fantasybei> do your guys don't care about javascript?just use jquery?
[06:07:12] <blackspotwiggins> fantasybei, relax, it was a misunderstanding
[06:07:20] <fantasybei> -_-!!!
[06:07:33] <blackspotwiggins> but yeah i think prototypes are not instances
[06:07:37] <gnarf> ?js function a() {}; a.prototype={}; a.prototype instanceOf a;
[06:07:38] <bot-t> gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[06:07:48] <gnarf> ?js function a() {}; a.prototype={}; a.prototype instanceof a;
[06:07:49] <bot-t> gnarf: false
[06:08:07] <gnarf> ?js function a() {}; a.prototype={}; a instanceof a;
[06:08:08] <bot-t> gnarf: false
[06:09:12] <codecab> Woet: why do u suggest to avoid the webchat?
[06:09:28] <fantasybei> i mean, in theory, if Function.prototype is a function, then, it's prototype should be Function.prototype
[06:09:39] <fantasybei> then, that would be a circle
[06:09:42] <Woet> [15:06:08] <Woet> codecab: cause you can't enter #jvascript, apparently
[06:09:55] <BlaDe^> ok great - now allow me to be more specific
[06:09:56] <gnarf> the prototype isn't a function, its should be object
[06:10:02] <BlaDe^> has anyone -here- used openid-selector?
[06:10:10] <Woet> BlaDe^: stop being so stubborn
[06:10:14] <BlaDe^> :)
[06:10:15] <Woet> what is your actual question
[06:10:22] <BlaDe^> I want to ask about implementing oauth selectors into it
[06:10:23] <fantasybei> hi gnarf, thanks
[06:10:28] <BlaDe^> not just openid
[06:10:31] <Woet> great, we're getting close now
[06:10:40] <Woet> did you ever realize people who don't even use it would be able to help you?
[06:10:43] <fantasybei> but, you can try to print it in firebug
[06:10:49] <fantasybei> it's indeed a function
[06:10:51] <blackspotwiggins> BlaDe^, what?
[06:10:56] <Woet> i don't have to drive your specific car model to tell you how to drive a car.
[06:11:14] <blackspotwiggins> it's a glorified linkmap anyway
[06:11:16] <blackspotwiggins> wtf is the point
[06:11:29] <codecab> Woet: ye, but i used to. wtf changed since 2 weeks ago?
[06:11:38] <gnarf> fantasybei: well, functions are also objects, so there is nothing stopping a prototype from being a function i suppose
[06:11:50] <gnarf> its just not how an "end user" would use it
[06:11:58] <Narhir> Im trying to... create sliding down and up for content that is dynamicly created
[06:12:21] <Narhir> in most slideUp's and SlideDowns it is based by ID.. how can I achieve it if my items that I want to sldie in and slideout
[06:12:29] <Narhir> have dynamicly created classes with their id's
[06:13:00] <blackspotwiggins> Narhir, based by id?
[06:13:04] <blackspotwiggins> you mean the selector is
[06:13:13] <blackspotwiggins> you can select by anything you want
[06:13:20] <Narhir> yes.. uhm can I put inside a .js file code like <?php ?>
[06:13:27] <Narhir> will it be executed?
[06:13:32] <blackspotwiggins> no
[06:13:42] <codecab> stuo
[06:13:45] <blackspotwiggins> well it could be, but not in the browser anyway
[06:13:54] <codecab> stupid ignorants
[06:13:55] <Narhir> the classes that I want to refer to is created int hat kind of way
[06:13:56] <Narhir> <div class="manager-slide manager-slide-<?php print $fields['nid']->content ?>">
[06:14:42] <silv3r_m00n> I need to check if an element has a parent div with a certain class , anywhere in the ancestral tree , how ?
[06:15:24] <Narhir> the thing is that I would have a few of those per page...
[06:15:55] <Narhir> and last time I created it wheneve rI clicked on "read more" it was closing and opening all read more content not only the clicked one
[06:19:22] <Sean-Der> Does anyone know of a way I could get for example 12 out of asd1asd2 ?
[06:19:38] <Sean-Der> Something along the lines of only grabbing numbers out a string?
[06:19:54] <aro> use regex
[06:21:06] <Sean-Der> Is jQuery's similar to PHP, doesn't really matter I will just find some cheat sheet
[06:21:06] <aro> var numbers = string.match(/\d/g);
[06:21:55] <aro> or : alert("#div-name-1234-characteristic".match(/\d+/));
[06:22:16] <blackspotwiggins> Sean-Der, regexes are pretty universal
[06:24:20] <gnarf> ?js "asd1asd2".replace(/\D/g,"");
[06:24:21] <bot-t> gnarf: "12"
[06:25:35] <Sean-Der> It looks like .text() doesn't accept arguments?
[06:25:58] <Narhir> ekhm.. anyone up for helping ?
[06:26:37] <gnarf> SilentPenguin: item.closest(".class").length
[06:26:41] <gnarf> er srr
[06:26:55] <gnarf> i guess the guy who asked that one was impatient
[06:27:12] <fantasybei> -_-!!!
[06:27:15] <gnarf> Sean-Der: it most definately does
[06:27:23] <gnarf> ?text
[06:27:23] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:27:30] <gnarf> ?text( value )
[06:27:31] <bot-t> gnarf, .text() - Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:27:36] <gnarf> boo bot-t
[06:28:17] <Sean-Der> I see how to select an element?
[06:28:39] <Sean-Der> Do I run the returned string through regex to a new string?
[06:31:41] <Sean-Der> Am I completely off with this? It looks like .text just uses a selector. So I am selecting my div,class and so on?
[06:31:56] <blackspotwiggins> Sean-Der, wtf?
[06:32:03] <blackspotwiggins> .text() doesnt select shit
[06:32:15] <blackspotwiggins> if look up 10 lines you'll see what it does
[06:32:57] <Sean-Der> var price = $(div).text();?
[06:33:54] <albertosh> Hello!
[06:34:07] <albertosh> what's the best shadowbox type plugin out there?
[06:34:19] <Brodingo> probably colorbox or fancybox
[06:34:33] <Brodingo> i recommend colorbox
[06:35:07] <albertosh> nice! will check them out, thanks!
[06:35:25] <fris> albertosh http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/
[06:35:53] <albertosh> WOW!
[06:35:56] <albertosh> thanks fris
[06:36:02] <fris> i like highslide myself
[06:36:15] <fris> colorbox is nice too, not too intrusive
[06:36:20] <fris> prob my top 2
[06:36:45] <albertosh> i'm looking for one that allows me to show images of around 1050 px height
[06:36:55] <albertosh> even if the image is bigger than screen size, without resize
[06:37:10] <albertosh> you know if any of those would do the trick?
[06:37:10] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[06:37:24] <Brodingo> haha wuttt
[06:37:24] <blackspotwiggins> image bigger than screen and without resize?
[06:37:34] <albertosh> yeah, so that the user will have to scroll down
[06:37:37] <albertosh> to see the rest
[06:37:55] <albertosh> i know it sounds really weird... but cant resize that image cause it has a lot of text
[06:38:06] <fris> albertosh you can set that via the width and height variable, the lightbox usally is just activated via the class
[06:38:07] <Brodingo> this all sounds terrible
[06:38:13] <blackspotwiggins> why not just link to the image?
[06:45:33] <juha_> i'm so evil that i edited our internal tool to contain lyrics of rebecca blacks friday song in a marquee in the top of the page :D
[06:46:38] <Sean-Der> I figure it out you can't use regex in .text() I selected my text applied regex to it and then put it out to my final variable
[07:01:52] <saba> I need to temporarily hide options in a select, however $('select option').hide () only works in FF. What would be the best workaround for this?
[07:02:04] <saba> I'm thinking using .data () and .detach ()
[07:02:21] <Brodingo> go for it
[07:02:40] <sphinxxx> saba: visibility?
[07:02:59] <sphinxxx> .css('visibility','hidden')
[07:02:59] <gnarf> saba: I assume you have at some point gotten all the "option" in a select right?
[07:03:12] <gnarf> sphinxxx: you have to remove the <option> from the dom for most browsers
[07:03:25] <sphinxxx> oh
[07:03:47] <saba> gnarf: yes, at the beginning I've got all of them. And depending on another select I'll only show a subset
[07:04:01] <gnarf> saba: keep the reference to "all of them"
[07:04:40] <gnarf> then select.empty().append( options.filter( fn ) );
[07:04:48] <gnarf> each time
[07:04:56] <gnarf> or you can maybe skip the empty
[07:05:11] <gnarf> select.append( options ); options.filter( fn ).detach();
[07:05:13] <saba> gnarf: and first var options = $('select') more or less?
[07:05:27] <gnarf> options = $("select").find("option")
[07:05:31] <saba> hm, that is better than using .data
[07:05:41] <saba> it's a good approach, thanks gnarf
[07:06:01] <gnarf> no need to store it on an element, you can just store it in a closure var
[07:06:14] <kborchers> gnarf occasionally has some good advice ;)
[07:07:10] <fantasybei> good
[07:07:28] <gnarf> kborchers: We should set up a jQuery UI JAM in rawkford ;)
[07:07:38] <kborchers> that would be kool
[07:08:00] <plombardi> Is there an equivalent of .listview('refresh') for collapsible-sets in jquery mobile?
[07:08:29] <kborchers> i'm actually thinking about going to the js.chi(); meetup next week ... it's a backbone.js hack night. figured it would be a good way to dive into backbone
[07:08:53] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[07:09:21] <kborchers> gnarf: you think we could get a crowd up there?
[07:09:31] <Mateo_> In a purpose of testing (i have a bug in my script that i can't identify), is there a way to unbind EVERY event that i have previously bind please ?
[07:09:31] <gnarf> prolly not
[07:09:35] <kborchers> heh
[07:09:41] <gnarf> but 2 heads + good food + beer
[07:10:30] <kborchers> = UI awesomeness!!
[07:10:57] <fantasybei> = _ =!
[07:11:28] <blackspotwiggins> Mateo_, $("*").unbind() ?
[07:12:11] <Mateo_> blackspotwiggins: looks like $.unbind() without argument should do the same thing.. i have to try thanks :)
[07:12:21] <blackspotwiggins> could be
[07:12:27] <tra> * might be a bit heavy operation
[07:12:35] <blackspotwiggins> it is
[07:12:45] <blackspotwiggins> but noone really does that in production anyway
[07:17:32] <bamccaig> I'm doing something like:  jQuery("#foo").trigger('custom', [ { 'foo' : 'bar' } ]);
[07:17:39] <Zzarkc-20> Hey. I'm having an issue with the .ajax url field. I have a js file in domain_here.com/directory/js/file.js that handles the ajax call, and a php file in domain_here.com/directory/site/other_file.php. How do I correctly fill in the url field for the ajax request?
[07:17:45] <bamccaig> The event handler is only getting { 'foo' : 'bar' }.
[07:17:56] <adamramadhan> hello
[07:18:05] <gnarf> ?trigger
[07:18:19] <gnarf> omg - bot-t!!!!
[07:18:21] <kborchers> lazy bot
[07:18:22] * gnarf cries
[07:18:23] <seutje> ?bot
[07:18:23] <ccmonster> hah
[07:18:29] <gnarf> .seen bot-t
[07:18:29] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 21 minutes and 9 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Disconnected by services
[07:18:29] <seutje> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[07:18:35] <adamramadhan> what is the main diffrence when im useing getscript or either append the javascript useing DOM ?
[07:18:42] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/trigger
[07:19:23] <adamramadhan> the olny diffrence that i see is that when we append the javascript we can see it after it loads the DOM, and if we use getscript it will get then execute but no javascript is appended.
[07:19:28] <ccmonster> hey, i am having an with if(page.State.indexOf('-') != -1) {// and it's saying Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'State' of undefined
[07:19:34] <ccmonster> but when i log it out, it's not undefined
[07:20:19] <bamccaig> Ah, I need to wrap my argument in an array... >_<
[07:21:47] <bamccaig> It doesn't really make complete sense to me, but it's working at least. :D
[07:22:10] <daveb> hi. I have a div that is draggable. contained witin that div, i have a smaller div, that i need a click handler on. it seems the click handler for te draggable fires and the click for the div does not.
[07:22:14] <daveb> any way to fix this?
[07:22:26] <ccmonster> any idea guys?
[07:22:40] <adamramadhan> ah here i found it here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5791279/jquery-getscript-vs-document-createelementscript is there anything else ?
[07:22:48] <adamramadhan> i still cant see any diffrence
[07:23:12] <Zzarkc-20> I'm pretty new to jquery, and don't even have a handle on where to start in fixing the syntax for my above question in the url field. I'm hoping it's not to complicated of a fix?
[07:23:42] <kborchers> daveb: from the way you describe it, you might need to check out http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:24:37] <gnarf> daveb: can you get a demo of that on jsfiddle? cuz I'm pretty sure that the innerMost click should happen before the outer container gets the click
[07:24:52] <daveb> gnarf: ok i'll do that. thanks.
[07:24:54] <gnarf> unless the outer container is trapping a mousedown
[07:25:20] <kborchers> which i think draggable does grab mousedown, doesn't it?
[07:25:23] <kborchers> to do the drag?
[07:25:48] <jeffsmykil> I would like to use the same xml call numerous times in a document from different functions
[07:25:54] <ccmonster> i'd think so kborchers
[07:26:06] <jeffsmykil> how can I do this, do I create a variable consisting of the function?
[07:26:11] <ccmonster> ok jeff, then call myxmlcall(){}
[07:26:15] <jeffsmykil> I need to obviously pass the xml parameter
[07:26:21] <ccmonster> ok jeff, then call myxmlcall( *
[07:26:27] <ccmonster> damn typos
[07:26:34] <ccmonster> nvm, my fingers wont work
[07:26:35] <ccmonster> lol
[07:26:50] <jeffsmykil> my brain doesn't, so we might be on the same page
[07:27:16] <ccmonster> from any other function, just put myxmlcall();
[07:27:18] <daveb> kborchers: i see two click handlers on the inner div I want to be clickable. 1 for draggable and 1 for my click handler.
[07:27:46] <kborchers> so you made that inner div draggable as well?
[07:28:04] <kborchers> as gnarf said, seeing your code would help us out a lot
[07:28:04] <ccmonster> function myfirstfunction(){ // do some stuff here myxmlcall();}
[07:28:12] <ccmonster> rinse, and repeat jeffsmykil
[07:28:39] <jeffsmykil> but fi the xml call is getting the same data every time
[07:28:52] <jeffsmykil> i dont want to have to go type url datatype in everyone
[07:28:52] <ccmonster> pastie jeffsmykil ?
[07:29:01] <jeffsmykil> yeah let me thing for a second
[07:29:04] <ccmonster> huh, you shouldn't have to
[07:29:05] <jeffsmykil> how to make it into one
[07:29:15] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: im just learning to pass parameters
[07:29:21] <jeffsmykil> so that may be the gap
[07:29:31] <ccmonster> myxmlcall(myxmlfilename.xml)
[07:30:01] <ccmonster> var file = 'StringNameOfXMLFile'; myxmlfunction(file);
[07:30:24] <jeffsmykil> and you can use find on that variable?
[07:30:30] <ccmonster> or however you decide to set it up. lots of options jeffsmykil .
[07:30:44] <ccmonster> find? um. give us a pastie first.
[07:30:51] <ccmonster> im sure we can guide your hand.
[07:30:57] <ccmonster> ? ajax xml
[07:31:16] <ccmonster> ?ajax
[07:31:21] <ccmonster> bots dead? BOOo
[07:31:42] <kborchers> ccmonster: bot-t had a little too much to drink last night and he's sleeping it off right now
[07:31:53] <ccmonster> kborchers, or gnarf : any chance you can help me with line 15/16 in this : http://pastie.org/2355966
[07:31:57] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster so I have an two menus both of which are populated from an xml file
[07:32:03] <daveb> danr! it works great here.
[07:32:04] <ccmonster> im geting a State is Undefined error
[07:32:06] <daveb> http://jsfiddle.net/SDsuh/2/
[07:32:07] <ccmonster> which makes no sense.
[07:32:27] <ccmonster> is their structure the same, just different content jeffs?
[07:32:30] <gnarf> ccmonster: page isn't declared in this paste
[07:32:47] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[07:32:51] <ccmonster> one sec gnarf . that's just one piece of code. let me pastie the outer part
[07:32:52] <jeffsmykil> but the second relies on the first
[07:33:02] <ccmonster> hmm.. pastie it then jeffsmykil

[07:34:47] <blackspotwiggins> suddenly, spam

[07:34:55] <jeffsmykil> there must be a name for that
[07:35:25] <ccmonster> what do you mean by 'menu'
[07:35:41] <jeffsmykil> to selects
[07:35:48] <gnarf> ccmonster: is the load_page being called before the init by any chance?
[07:35:51] <jeffsmykil> the second relies on what is displayed in the first
[07:36:10] <Narhir> anyone ? please? http://jsfiddle.net/RA3nL/ advice?
[07:36:18] <ccmonster> i dotn think so. I am double checking.
[07:36:22] <RubyTN> gnarf:  tnx
[07:36:43] <ccmonster> just pastie something jeffsmykil ,
[07:36:47] <ccmonster> it will help out
[07:36:49] <gnarf> ccmonster: also, I am noticing that it seems you are passing page.State into that function as "obj" why not just keep referencing "obj" ?
[07:36:55] <jeffsmykil> i know it will
[07:37:19] <ccmonster> so just ref page.State within the obj, instead of passing it ?
[07:37:30] <jeffsmykil> fiddle needs an xml box
[07:38:05] <ccmonster> in your js just do a var xml = 'paste some xml in here' then just reference it in your code so we can see the xml structure
[07:38:10] <gnarf> ccmonster: no, inside of the error callback, why are you digging to page.State instead of just using "obj"
[07:38:31] <jeffsmykil> ccmonster: basically on success I want to define a variable with the xml contents
[07:38:43] <gnarf> isn't obj (from the load_page: function( obj ) ) the page.State anyway?
[07:38:56] <ccmonster> yes, but i have two diff fall back cases.
[07:39:10] <gnarf> but yeah, its weird that you're having an undefined issue there, it seems like it should be set
[07:39:14] <ccmonster> 18WABB9W3, the page name has a structure like Sports-Basketball , and i split at the - and retry
[07:39:20] <gnarf> but you are probably messing it up somehwere else ;)
[07:39:23] <ccmonster> that's what i'm saying gnarf.
[07:39:26] <ccmonster> hahahah :) probably
[07:39:43] <Narhir> anyone could check this out and suggest what I did wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/RA3nL/
[07:39:59] <gnarf> Narhir: it might help if we knew what you were trying to do
[07:40:11] <Narhir> gnarf thank you!!!
[07:40:30] <Narhir> gnarf Im trying toa chieve something like that: http://www.mediamind.com/content.aspx?page=executive_management
[07:40:33] <ccmonster> i am goign to try the obj.cat within the function, but i'd rather keep referencing the same piece, tbh, but i seemed to be  having issues
[07:40:39] <kborchers> Narhir: is this more like what you want
[07:40:40] <Narhir> but.. for right now Im only able to hide content...
[07:40:48] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/RA3nL/1/
[07:41:10] <Narhir> kborchers : well.. it is a lot better then mine version
[07:41:20] <Narhir> altough few of those read mores should be available to be open
[07:41:27] <Narhir> or close.. right now we can open only one
[07:42:12] <gnarf> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/RA3nL/3/
[07:42:29] <ccmonster> ahh, i see what's happening...gnarf.
[07:42:35] <Narhir> wow ...
[07:42:37] <kborchers> gnarf: you beat me to it
[07:42:43] <Narhir> awesome ;dd
[07:42:46] <Narhir> one more.. question
[07:42:56] <Narhir> is there a way.. to change the text in "read more" ?
[07:43:02] <Narhir> based on if it is open or closed ?
[07:43:28] <ccmonster> if the page is bad, and diff than the default (which it's overwriting via the $.extend), then on the initial load there is no page.State set perhaps?
[07:45:12] <gnarf> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/RA3nL/4/
[07:46:23] <Narhir> thats awesome :DD
[07:46:46] <Narhir> thanks soo much :D
[07:47:06] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/RA3nL/5/
[07:47:12] <gnarf> kborchers: sorry, didn't mean to make it a race ;)
[07:47:27] <Brodingo> small revision, do it on complete so multiple clicks dont muck it up
[07:47:46] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, Narhir http://html5doctor.com/the-details-and-summary-elements/
[07:48:05] <Narhir> okay.
[07:48:06] <Narhir> I broke it
[07:48:20] <Narhir> can I put "readmore" after "manager-slide"
[07:48:23] <Narhir> and still make it work ?
[07:48:40] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: nice
[07:48:53] <Narhir> I can! I used prev insteda of next :)
[07:48:55] <gnarf> Narhir: use prev() instead of next() ?
[07:49:09] <Narhir> yea :D
[07:49:13] <Narhir> Figured it out ! :)
[07:49:32] <Brodingo> Narhir, did you see my fiddle?
[07:49:45] <blackspotwiggins> beside the accessibilty issue, it looks hot
[07:50:09] <ccmonster> Ok gnarf : http://pastie.org/2355966 , i added the output. Not sure why I am getting this problem. It seems it's set in the obj that's passed but then gone in the error: function
[07:50:41] <Narhir> Brodingo : Yes I did :)
[07:50:44] <Narhir> thank you :)
[07:50:52] <Brodingo> ;)
[07:50:56] <Narhir> Im going to sue your vesion actually
[07:51:13] <Narhir> if ti will work
[07:51:25] <Narhir> it doesnt
[07:51:27] <Narhir> Im soo lucky
[07:52:06] <kborchers> bot-t: Nooooooooooooooo
[07:52:11] <kborchers> come back!!!!
[07:53:00] <daveb> ok so the issue is in my _real_ code which has a large canvas with a lower z-index than the clickable div.
[07:53:01] <xec> maybe if we all shout "bot-t" at the same time it will come back
[07:53:02] <ccmonster> haha kborchers
[07:53:16] <daveb> so I am not sure why its not letting the click through.
[07:53:40] <daveb> i think I figured it out.
[07:54:14] <tdskate> hello again
[07:55:23] <ccmonster> anyone able to jump in on this? : http://pastie.org/2355966 , i added the output. Not sure why I am getting this problem. It seems it's set in the obj that's passed but then gone in the error: function
[07:58:43] <phlp> ccmonster: the problem is line 76. page doesnt have .State
[07:59:15] <Narhir> Brodingo : I tried to implement this cod.e. but it doesnt work Imnot srue why maybe you have some idea? http://173.203.218.231:81/company/about-us/executive-management
[07:59:29] <ccmonster> i am getting an error even before that
[07:59:37] <ccmonster> on 71
[07:59:53] <Narhir> what kind of error?
[08:00:04] <phlp> the output shows those logs working though?
[08:00:14] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2355966 , Narhir
[08:00:40] <kborchers> ccmonster: that pastie shows 71 working and erroring on 76
[08:00:45] <ccmonster> one sec.
[08:00:53] <Brodingo> Narhir need a doc ready i think
[08:01:13] <Narhir> hm ?
[08:01:17] <Narhir> Ah
[08:01:21] <Narhir> maybe DOM thingie ?
[08:01:41] <Brodingo> well your scripts are in your head
[08:01:53] <Brodingo> and that click handler isnt wrapped in a doc ready
[08:02:35] <Brodingo> i put my scripts at the bottom of the page before </body> on my page.tpl.php
[08:02:58] <Narhir> clever...
[08:03:22] <Narhir> is wraping it better now ?
[08:03:26] <Narhir> I wraped it in: window.addEvent('domready',function() {
[08:04:07] <Brodingo> jquery doc ready is $(document).ready(function(){ //code });
[08:04:20] <Brodingo> or short $(function(){ //code });
[08:04:56] <Narhir> the script that you provided seems to be in that format ?
[08:05:32] <kborchers> ccmonster: your error is on 77. how would page have page.State.cat when it's just a string? i think you want obj.State.cat = page; there
[08:06:00] <Brodingo> jsfiddle can wrap it automatically with some options on the left
[08:06:20] <windsurf_> I'm using .ajax() and have a beforeSend handler in which I add a header, but i don't see my header showing up. What am I doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/jegtXdm3
[08:06:37] <Narhir> got it !
[08:06:38] <Narhir> it works:D
[08:06:42] <Narhir> thanks againa  ton Brodingo ! :D
[08:08:05] <Brodingo> Narhir you may notice particularly on a beta site with performance options turned off that lots of scripts in the head blocks the rest of the page loading
[08:08:38] <Brodingo> if you move scripts to the bottom there may be a flash of unbehaviored content but the page shows up quicker
[08:09:23] <seivan> Hmm, does anyone know how the get the responseHeaders from a success call that returns json ?
[08:09:26] <blackspotwiggins> "flash of unbehaved content" sounds cool
[08:10:15] <Narhir> hmm
[08:10:17] <djQuery> typicaly to remove the flash I add <body class="nojs">   then using css hide items that are required for the javascript version of the page.  in the $(document).ready  I remove teh nojs class from the body after I have my stuff ready
[08:10:18] <Narhir> good idea Brodingo :)
[08:10:46] <blackspotwiggins> why should there be a flash caused by js ?
[08:11:08] <djQuery> blackspotwiggins: because the html is displayed before the javascript is run
[08:11:32] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[08:11:32] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 19 minutes and 44 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[08:11:44] <blackspotwiggins> js should not influence how page looks
[08:11:46] <djQuery> every time I come on bot-t leaves
[08:12:19] <djQuery> blackspotwiggins: depends on what u are doing. jqueryui for example?   .tabs()
[08:12:28] <windsurf_> what are the restrictions of setting custom headers with jsonp if any?
[08:12:32] <kborchers> djQuery: so stop coming here for the common good ;)
[08:12:39] <blackspotwiggins> windsurf_, you cant set anything
[08:12:47] <blackspotwiggins> it works using a script tag
[08:13:53] <jeffsmykil> how come a parameter i pass to the success function in an ajax call gets changed to success?
[08:14:56] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil, because you can't "pass" a parameter to a function that ends up getting invoked with specific arguments
[08:15:02] <windsurf_> blackspotwiggins: well the docs seem to suggest that I can set request headers, but the headers I've tried don't show up (see pastebin above)
[08:15:27] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano
[08:16:35] <jeffsmykil> nm figured it out
[08:18:13] <spacemunkay> Hi
[08:18:34] <hokapoka> Anyone used aloha much?  Looking for soem feed back as to how goo dit it.
[08:18:55] <hokapoka> s/goo dit it/good it is/
[08:19:55] <hokapoka> It appears that the default settings use <b> and <i> tags, for bold and italic respectivly.  Whereas, I would have expected the use of strong and em.
[08:20:05] <djQuery> hokapoka: I find it confusing as I never know if someone is coming or going
[08:20:05] <Hoe``> hey guys, what's the best way to pass data back from a dialog to a script?
[08:20:19] <Hoe``> I've been using .data() on the dialog, but I dislike this
[08:20:44] <hokapoka> djQuery: eh?
[08:21:04] <hokapoka> oh, you're making a reference to the name?
[08:21:05] <djQuery> ?g define aloha
[08:21:12] <ajpiano> hokapoka: i have never used it beyond experimentation... it is certainly a bit on the heavy side
[08:21:31] <hokapoka> ajpiano: yes that's another aspect that I've noticed.
[08:21:31] <ajpiano> but it's pretty cool
[08:21:36] <djQuery> Hoe``: I usualy just create a var before calling the dialog.
[08:22:03] <hokapoka> I need to get a WYSIWYG editor plumbed into an app.  Any suggestions?
[08:22:15] <Hoe``> djQuery: In the 'window' scope?
[08:23:07] <djQuery> Hoe``: or in a custom scope   var myVars = {};
[08:23:10] <ajpiano> hokapoka: all wysiwygs are pretty ... large and cumbersome however... i'd say go with aloha or CKEditor..
[08:23:22] <hokapoka> I've used (f)CKeditor and TinyMCE a whole bunch, but that was a while back.  Wondered if there are any new ones that are... i dunno more modern maybe
[08:23:22] <Hoe``> djQuery: What if two instances of the same dialog happen?
[08:23:29] <rumblejungle> hi! i'm having trouble with the jquery ui kit... i get the ui.panel is undefined error all the time... how can i fix that?
[08:23:37] <ajpiano> CKEditor is still pretty modern, i'd say
[08:23:56] <djQuery> Hoe``: at the same time? I thought that was the point in a dialog is that there was only one?
[08:24:15] <Hoe``> That's a modal dialog
[08:24:15] <hokapoka> ajpiano: okay.
[08:24:24] <Brodingo> markitup is pretty nice, not a wysiwig but a markup helper with a preview
[08:24:27] <djQuery> Hoe``:   $('.someDiv').data('myDialogVar', soemthing).dialog()
[08:24:41] <hokapoka> I've found the WordPress one extreamly nice to use, much nicer than when I've used CK in the past.
[08:24:50] <Hoe``> ya, that's how I've been doing it :) I was wondering if there was a better way
[08:24:52] <kborchers> rumblejungle: gonna need a little more info. which widget are you using? what are the events leading up to this error?
[08:25:08] <Hoe``> I meant like a way the jQuery designers intended, I honestly was not sure
[08:25:35] <hokapoka> I heard that WordPress uses a modified version of TinyMCE.
[08:25:36] <djQuery> Hoe``: think you can pass it in the .dialog options as well.
[08:26:11] <ccmonster> hey kborchers and phlp , the thing is line 11 shows me setting up page.State
[08:26:11] <rumblejungle> kborchers: .tabs(add: xxxx)
[08:26:14] <djQuery> Hoe``: .dialgo({customData: 'whatever' }); then it will still be accessable inside the dialog callbacks
[08:26:14] <ccmonster> how does it become undefined?
[08:26:16] <Hoe``> oh ,hmm, interesting idea
[08:26:32] <Hoe``> ah, that's a cool idea :)
[08:27:13] <kborchers> ccmonster: but you have defined page as a string locally ... that is the page var you are referring to, not the one on 11. either use obj instead of page or change var page inside of error
[08:27:42] <ccmonster> so var state = page.State you are saying?
[08:28:03] <kborchers> no, var state = obj.cat.slice(0, obj.cat.lastIndexOf('-'));
[08:28:04] <rumblejungle> kborchers: $('.tabs').tabs({add: function(event, ui) { $(this).tabs('select', '#' + ui.panel.id);}});
[08:28:27] <Hoe``> dQuery: how would I access that after it's been constructed?
[08:28:43] <ccmonster> on which line kborchers ?
[08:28:50] <kborchers> 76
[08:29:16] <ccmonster> i updated the pastie with some tweaks i've done.
[08:29:24] <ccmonster> i think i did what you are referring to, if you could check
[08:30:33] <phlp> ccmonster: just dont reuse the variable name 'page' you defined it on 4 then redefined it on 78
[08:30:37] <lacrymology> is there an easy way of sending a complex (JSON formatted, preferrably) object as a GET parameter?
[08:31:34] <ScottO_> will the validationplugin work with jquery 1.5.1 ?
[08:31:56] <kborchers> ccmonster: i don't see where obj is defined
[08:32:02] <ccmonster> ok, i changed it to newcat
[08:32:05] <ScottO_> im using 1.3 and couldnt upgrade to 1.4 because of an issue
[08:32:12] <ccmonster> it's passed in to the load_page function
[08:32:24] <kborchers> gotcha
[08:33:15] <toastyghost> this probably isn't the greatest place for this, but i have a flowplayer instance im loading via a jquery ajax call, and when it loads it only shows flowplayer, not any of the other content.  it's there in the markup, the relevant css properties (display, opacity, visibility, z-index, height, width) appear to be set in a way that it would be visible, it just isn't.  does anyone know what might
[08:33:15] <toastyghost> be causing this? i am out of ideas
[08:33:47] <kborchers> ccmonster: ok, now where is page.State defined?
[08:34:23] <toastyghost> http://redesign.ivygroup.com/portfolio, click on the first or third video.  the way it looks when it first loads, before the ajax requests, is what it's supposed to look like.  the lion face and the question mark (top left and right corners) are the thumbnails that have videos associated with them.
[08:34:27] <kborchers> i see it
[08:34:49] <ccmonster> in the init()
[08:35:21] <ScottO_> correction, im on jquery v1.4
[08:39:08] <kborchers> ccmonster: so you're using bbq too, right?
[08:39:23] <ccmonster> for the deparam.
[08:39:27] <kborchers> right
[08:39:36] <ccmonster> i was using it initially, but moved to history.js instead
[08:40:19] <spacemunkay> Hey, wondering if using a timeout is the only way to detect a connection loss with a jQuery ajax call.  Basically I'm looking to see if an external script is available, if not, resort to a local script.  I've tried .ajax({ error: function}) and .ajaxError, both seem only to trigger on status code errors.
[08:40:57] <phlp> my work forces windows updates + restart at 10:30am while everyone is working. so stupid
[08:41:10] <ccmonster> hah
[08:41:14] <spacemunkay> nice
[08:41:20] <kborchers> phlp: really? wow
[08:42:03] <phlp> yep. installing more updates too so probably about to get another restart
[08:42:25] <kborchers> everyone wave bye-bye to phlp ;)
[08:42:34] <sphinxxx> wtf, do it at 4am
[08:42:36] <sphinxxx> lol
[08:44:12] <kborchers> ccmonster: just to humor me, can you console.log obj, obj.cat, and page just as you enter the error callback and show me the output?
[08:44:48] <ccmonster> sure
[08:45:45] <spacemunkay> I guess they know most of the comps are on at 10:30, but why not over lunch if that's the case.
[08:46:26] <ccmonster> yea, one sec
[08:47:31] <zmaril> Is there a way to prevent jquery mobile from automatically doing stuff to a webpage?
[08:47:56] <twoface> you could stop using it? :)
[08:48:02] <phlp> they do require everyone to leave their computer on all the time so they shouldnt be off. they also restart over night fairly often so they probably do updates then too.
[08:49:10] <zmaril> twoface: nah they have some neat stuff. It's just that it comes with a bunch of agressive defaults.
[08:49:41] <djQuery> Hoe``: it would be inside the this.options at that point.   or console.log this and see where its at
[08:49:48] <twoface> zmaril, you mean your webpage changes just by including jquery ui?
[08:50:23] <zmaril> twoface: Nah we already use UI. Jquery mobile changes things though.
[08:50:46] <twoface> really? didn't know - havent tried it yet, though
[08:50:57] <zmaril> The background color changes and many of the controls get messed with just by loading it into the page
[08:51:12] <zmaril> Yeah, query mobile seems like something that was meant to be included at the start of the project.
[08:53:21] <thefalling> Im using a load method on one of my divs when i select an item in a select, but it doesnt retain post vars from one of the forms, how would i get the form to post w/o a postback?
[08:53:47] <thefalling> not sure if that made any sense :S
[08:55:25] <ccmonster> wow, kborchers  you there?
[08:55:40] <kborchers> yep
[08:55:56] <ccmonster> this is so weird dude.
[08:56:11] <kborchers> not what you expected in those objects?
[08:56:40] <zmaril> #jquerymobile
[08:56:50] <ccmonster> yea, totally odd.
[08:57:16] <ccmonster> history.getState shows the cat as Sports-Error, but the obj shows Sports, but it's before I've ever chopped it
[08:57:18] <ccmonster> SO strange.
[08:58:11] <zoned> is false == undefined?
[08:59:03] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2355966
[08:59:18] <ccmonster> huh zoned? false is false, undefined is undefined
[08:59:28] <zoned> i have a boolean that is false, then i have a check to see if it was set or not if (it == undefined) it = true; and it always turns out true at the end...
[08:59:59] <DukeDrake> why is $("#mydivid") null? -.-
[09:00:01] <ccmonster> it's getting overwritten somehow ?
[09:00:06] <ccmonster> because it's null?
[09:00:08] <kborchers> ccmonster: you are calling load_page multiple times most likely. i see you are calling it in few places, probably need to check the order of when those are executed and if obj is updated in between
[09:00:17] <DukeDrake> no, it's not :/
[09:00:49] <zoned> ccmonster.... var test = false; alert(test); if (test== undefined) test = true; alert(test);         the alert goes 'false' then another one 'true'
[09:01:09] <zoned> how do i fix this? and why is false = undefined? confused...
[09:01:38] <swiggy> I am trying to create a form validation script, but my validation process requires a JSON request to check a CAPTCHA image/answer (using $.ajax) -- the problem is, if they click 'submit' immidately after finishing the captcha answer textbox, even if they have the right answer, it says they do not - BUT if they click submit AGAIN it will say they have the right answer (because the JSON request would be finished at this poi
[09:01:38] <swiggy> nt)
[09:01:39] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/dFY6e/
[09:01:54] <swiggy> I have tried everything i can think of.. a timer to check their answer, onblur event, on change event
[09:01:57] <swiggy> on submit event
[09:02:02] <djQuery> hmmm how do I make a ui.dialog come to the top of several dialogs?
[09:02:05] <swiggy> but nothing will give enough time
[09:02:09] <swiggy> anyone have any ideas??
[09:02:22] <ccmonster> the top?
[09:02:26] <swiggy> even putting return false, or return true in the $.ajax() success method wont work
[09:02:27] <DukeDrake> everything is null ........ this reminds me of something ...
[09:02:31] <ccmonster> yea kborchers i am calling it.
[09:02:43] <ccmonster> on page load, then if the state changes.
[09:02:46] <swiggy> because $.ajax always returns true (if they request hits the page successfully)
[09:05:07] <phlp> swiggy: if you rely on the client side to block the form until your captcha ajax works out that will be easy to bypass. you need to check the captcha on the server side with the post
[09:05:32] <djQuery> anyone know how to force a dialog to come to the top of all the dialogs? http://jsbin.com/ejojuq/2/edit
[09:05:39] <swiggy> i have serverside check aswell
[09:05:57] <swiggy> but i want the clientside to work too
[09:06:51] <swiggy> oo i got an idea!
[09:07:00] <swiggy> is there a way for me to know if all the $.ajax() requests are finished??
[09:07:19] <swiggy> like if its in an active ajax request - wait until its finished
[09:07:28] <swiggy> that should solve my problem!
[09:07:35] <ccmonster> any other ideas kborchers ?
[09:08:32] <djQuery> swiggy: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[09:08:41] <kborchers> ccmonster: not really, sorry. :( it looks like somewhere obj is being updated, but then needs to be reinitialized before your ajax call happens again
[09:09:33] <ccmonster> yea, which is STRANGE no?
[09:11:05] <kborchers> ccmonster: well not strange if you expect it to have values similar to its initialized state at that point. otherwise, your code needs to be prepared for it to not be in that state at the point.
[09:11:32] <ccmonster> yea. i am just not sure where and under what circumstance exactly it's being overwritten or not available
[09:11:55] <swiggy> ugh :-\ using 1.4
[09:12:11] <kborchers> neither am i, gonna just have to trace it through and log obj a million times until you find what's changing it and when
[09:12:17] <swiggy> i am creating a ajax counter right now
[09:12:20] <swiggy> not to difficult
[09:12:25] <swiggy> ill post it when im done
[09:13:37] <ccmonster> yea. I am seeing if i can get away without storeing my own state and just reusing the History.getState() , and only working about massaging the state on init()
[09:14:00] <ccmonster> i figure if i coerce the url correctly on init(), then History.getState() she be all good thus forth
[09:14:14] <kborchers> that sounds reasonable
[09:15:25] <ccmonster> interesting. i got it working perfecty, but aesthetically (code) I just dont like it
[09:15:36] <ccmonster> I like the idea of actually storing the obj, but ....w/e clever
[09:17:09] <DukeDrake> this doesn't work at all -.-
[09:17:18] <DukeDrake> I can't get my jquery function running
[09:17:24] <ccmonster> hmorrisMT, i need to remove the last state though if it misses
[09:18:08] <DukeDrake> it keeps on claiming that it can't address the DOM elements -.-
[09:18:17] <letterpress> what should i look for when jquery doesn't pull the html5 data elements into the jquery object? some elements on the page are working fine. and my jsfiddle works fine.
[09:18:44] <letterpress> but in real life, the jquery object for that element has no data attributes
[09:19:08] <letterpress> and i have to access the value data-rowbodyid="TICKET_ROW_BODY_0" through .attr() for instance
[09:19:46] <ccmonster> i am going to shoot this thing. bahh
[09:20:14] <mixmasterxp> I want to create a full browser postback to the server by just clicking a link, is there a way to do this?
[09:20:27] <mixmasterxp> not with ajax
[09:20:46] <donburks> mixmasterxp: Define 'full browser postback', please?
[09:21:03] <mixmasterxp> donburks: clicking the submit button on a form
[09:21:09] <DukeDrake> how can I check with a function if jquery is loaded at all?
[09:21:15] <djQuery> Hoe``: http://jsbin.com/ejojuq/3/edit
[09:21:28] <DukeDrake> (it says "$(document) is null" )
[09:22:42] <DukeDrake> $(document).ready(function() { alert('check'); });  works however
[09:23:13] <hhdk> I have multiple buttons and each of them has a unique class and a "global" class. How can I scan and detect which button is clicked? Instead of doing a if($(this).hasClass('someClass')) { something() } ...
[09:23:26] <donburks> mixmasterxp: And you want everything in the form to post?
[09:24:02] <donburks> DukeDrake: How about if(window.jQuery) { //foo }
[09:24:44] <hhdk> I want to search for 4 different classes, when there is a match, I want to know what the match was.
[09:24:46] <donburks> hhdk: Bind a click action to the global class. Then, the one that was clicked will be $(this)
[09:25:32] <swiggy> djQuery, http://pastebin.com/rTjeQi4F -- will my checkAjax() function return true/false correctly in that pastebin?
[09:25:38] <DukeDrake> donburks: works
[09:25:50] <swiggy> ie: if it returns true = submit form; if it returns false = dont submit
[09:25:54] <DukeDrake> but why does addressing not work -.-
[09:26:08] <swiggy> (thats not the exact validation code btw.. just a quick example)
[09:26:18] <donburks> DukeDrake: Do you have a fiddle or pastie with the code?
[09:26:29] <hhdk> @dunburks Yeah, they all have a "global" class. $('p.sortButton').click(function() {} );
[09:26:33] <DukeDrake> the "code" is alert($(document).html());
[09:26:45] <DukeDrake> it says "$(document) is null"
[09:26:49] <donburks> Try $(body).html()
[09:26:57] <donburks> Er: $("body").html()
[09:27:29] <donburks> hhdk: In your click function, $(this) will refer to the one that was clicked. Then you can just do $(this).attr('class') and figure out which one it is.
[09:27:49] <DukeDrake> $("body") is null
[09:28:08] <donburks> DukeDrake: At the risk of asking a dumb question....is there anything in the body of the webpage?
[09:28:09] <swiggy> can someone confirm that -->  http://pastebin.com/rTjeQi4F <-- will return true or false if            return checkAjax();     is used??
[09:28:21] <DukeDrake> donburks: of course!!!!
[09:29:06] <hhdk> @dunburks Each button has multiple classes. I need to search for 4 unique classes. Hm.. But I guess, that I can give the buttons unique ID's instead.
[09:29:44] <swiggy> no one?
[09:29:56] <donburks> swiggy: Looking. Patience, grasshoppah.
[09:30:44] <djQuery> swiggy: yes it will but I dont think that it will do it for you
[09:31:11] <djQuery> swiggy: maybe in the ajax before send check that and then do a wait there
[09:31:12] <donburks> DukeDrake: Can you post a fiddle with samples, please?
[09:31:25] <donburks> swiggy: Also make sure you're setting async: true
[09:31:37] <djQuery> swiggy: but that will just cause all of them to spool up
[09:33:03] <djQuery> swiggy: what you want is to only allow 1 at a time so it realy only needs to be a boolean. in the success callback set the boolean to true. when you start it set it to false. before you set it check to see if it is false and cancel out?
[09:33:39] <djQuery> DukeDrake: sounds like bad html to me
[09:33:45] <zoned> can i add a .change function to each of my text inputs in a loop? can someone tell me why this doesn't work? or is there a better way? http://pastebin.com/9NbShadk
[09:33:45] <zoned> thanks
[09:33:46] <swiggy> hmm
[09:34:19] <djQuery> swiggy: is the goal to only allow 1 at a time or to only allow 1 once the other has completed?
[09:34:56] <djQuery> var x = $.ajax({options});  if (ajaxrunning) x.cancel()?
[09:35:06] <djQuery> so only the newest one is running?
[09:35:10] <cherish> Hi all.. just wondering if you could help with a bit of code to change the contents of a div on click by pulling info from an image var.
[09:36:24] <djQuery> only 10 more votes till my answer surpasses the crappy css answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/remove-close-button-on-jqueryui-dialog/5301251#5301251
[09:36:38] <swiggy> the goal is to only allow the form to be submitted once the ajax/json request has finished and checked that the answer matches the captcha (original code: http://jsfiddle.net/dFY6e/)
[09:36:52] <zoned> cherish, $('#divId').click(function(e) { $('#divId').html('some stuff'); });
[09:36:55] <swiggy> "  I am trying to create a form validation script, but my validation process requires a JSON request to check a CAPTCHA image/answer (using $.ajax) -- the problem is, if they click 'submit' immidately after finishing the captcha answer textbox, even if they have the right answer, it says they do not - BUT if they click submit AGAIN it will say they have the right answer (because the JSON request would be finished at this
[09:36:55] <swiggy> point "
[09:37:14] <djQuery> swiggy: only 1 successfull post? or only 1 post?
[09:37:26] <cherish> I have a image wrapper and some mousetraps that act as cursors prev and next.. upon clicking these they load the next or prev image in my img var but I have a longDescription: in there which holds some info for the product.  I need to get it so that when cursor is clicked it changes the info
[09:37:54] <cherish> <zoned> hi.. would you mind having a quick look at my source and see what I mean.. ?
[09:38:30] <djQuery> swiggy: then just have the ajax set a boolean when it is done? disallow the submit button till it is done? easy enough to mark the submit button as disabled then enable it in the success funciton?
[09:39:05] <cherish> <zoned> hi.. I have got it to work on the thumbnail click but not sure how to do the cursors one..
[09:39:10] <djQuery> cherish: ?tooltip?
[09:40:14] <cherish> <djQuery> its just some product information that is inside a longdescription.
[09:40:38] <cherish> <djQuery> its just some product information that is inside a longdescription.  its at http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride.html
[09:40:48] <djQuery> cherish: then use one of the hundreds of tooltip plugins to display it?
[09:41:01] <zoned> ?pastebin
[09:41:01] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:41:06] <zoned> cherish ^
[09:41:20] <swiggy> yeah i guess thats an easy solution djQuery
[09:41:23] <djQuery> bot-t: welcome back
[09:41:24] <bot-t> djQuery, Get - It can be: http://docs.jquery.com/Get
[09:41:28] <swiggy> just set the beforesend to set the button to disabled
[09:41:41] <datlap> i m using formset. when a user add a new form, it shows all the existing objects (objects he added before), which I dont want. How can I limit it to just 1
[09:41:54] <swiggy> or set the button to disabled from the beginning until all the required fields are set and then enable it
[09:42:03] <djQuery> swiggy: I would probably just have it disabled completly
[09:42:12] <djQuery> yeah
[09:42:13] <swiggy> only problem with that is, that would require the user to have javascript enabled
[09:43:03] <swiggy> my plan was just to have 'additional' security by havign a clientside check before the post, so they do not have to re-enter all the info they submitted
[09:43:09] <swiggy> but not require javascript
[09:43:46] <djQuery> swiggy: not realy  <body class="nojs">
[09:44:01] <swiggy> eh?
[09:44:41] <djQuery> the nojs css would set it to enabled remove the nojs class via javascript and add a js class.  the js .btnSubmit would disable it
[09:45:18] <cherish> <zoned> http://pastebin.com/zqxuR6Nw
[09:45:37] <swiggy> im confused, if the client doesnt have javascript enabled - how would that work?
[09:46:06] <djQuery> swiggy: because it would only be disabled if they had javascript enabled
[09:46:07] <cherish> <zoned>:  or source is at http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride.html
[09:46:10] <zoned> can someone please tell me why i can't add .change functions in a loop like this? this doesn't work.... see comments and code: http://pastebin.com/WLn7gcFw
[09:46:53] <zoned> cherish, what's the problem exactly?
[09:47:06] <swiggy> oh i see what your saying now, i gotcha i gotcha
[09:47:09] <djQuery> zoned: why would you want to?
[09:47:41] <zoned> because i don't want to type it out 30 times, and the number 30 could change. i'd actually like to be able to dynamically create the text inputs themselves too, if possible..
[09:47:57] <djQuery> zoned: add a class to the steps then add the change to the class?
[09:48:24] <djQuery> $('.steps').change()
[09:48:42] <cherish> <zoned>:  I need the dressinfo box to also update with the relevant description for the image selected..  when you click on a left or right cursor at the moment, the image change but the info stays the same so I need it to change to show the relevant images longdescription
[09:48:44] <zoned> djquery, the problem is the number needs to change, if you change '#step5PC' it needs to call updateFromPC(5, #step5PC.val())
[09:49:36] <djQuery> zoned: so?   inside the change you would be able to get all that information.
[09:49:39] <cherish> Can anyone also suggest a good jquery image library for use with the ipad and iphone. ?
[09:50:11] <cherish> for use with jquery mobile obviously.
[09:50:40] <djQuery> updateFromPC(this.id.replace('step', '').replace('PC', ''), this.value);
[09:50:44] <zoned> djquery, i would have to give each input its own class?
[09:50:52] <afeijo> I've just got an stupid request, after laghing a lot, I had to come here
[09:51:19] <zoned> cherish, there's too much code for me to look at there.... but this should be pretty simple, give me a sec
[09:51:24] <afeijo> an client asked me to disable the mouse scroll !!! their users use the scroll while in a <SELECT>, changing the value, and hit the save button... omg!!!
[09:51:28] <djQuery> zoned: no just give all the step ones the same class. then you can also us .live instead of .click to bind to all of them even ones that are not created yet
[09:51:33] <afeijo> can jquery disable stupid users????
[09:51:45] <cherish> <zoned>:Thanks :)
[09:51:47] <Aquaguy> is there any way to stop a .each( function (){ some code }) with a break or something ?
[09:52:07] <djQuery> afeijo: dont think that is possible.
[09:52:25] <afeijo> djQuery, ok, what about do what he asked for? disable the scroll button? :)
[09:52:31] <djQuery> afeijo: and dont think it is the user that is stupid in this case
[09:52:41] <afeijo> I do
[09:53:34] <djQuery> Aquaguy: suround it with a while(x)   then set x = false inside the .each
[09:53:47] <djQuery> no dont think that will do it
[09:54:40] <djQuery> Aquaguy: you can reduce the overhead of the each by checking some other var before doing anything else
[09:54:52] <PooBakery> Hi guys.. I'm a bit lost here. I am using the jquery template system. It's working fine so far, but there's one thing I could not figure out.. how do I do a for (var i = 0; i < foo; i++) loop in a template? I don't want to create an array and use a foreach loop for doing simple things like numbering fields
[09:54:57] <djQuery> zoned did that make sense
[09:55:00] <zoned> cherish, does this make sense? http://pastebin.com/UaJbCsXA
[09:56:31] <zoned> djquery, not really lol.
[09:57:00] <cherish> <zoned>:Ta will have a look at it
[09:58:35] <zoned> djquery, all i know is everything works perfect if i manually type the .changes individually..... i'm just trying to do that in a loop. is that not possible?
[09:59:12] <djQuery> zoned yes it is but its crap.
[10:00:05] <PooBakery> or to rephrase my question. does jquery template allow me to do simple for loops instead of foreach loops.. or does foreach also work with an integer as argument?
[10:00:17] <datlap> i have this formset that user can create new object and edit existing object. is there a way to delete an object in a formset?
[10:00:34] <zoned> ok, so can we go over this one more time.... i want to create X amount of text inputs all with the same class, then i want to add a .live function to that class which calls my update function? and i get the index by parsing the string of the text inputs id (since its in there)?
[10:00:59] <zoned> djquery^
[10:01:01] <swiggy> fuck it
[10:01:06] <swiggy> im just goign to check it on serverside
[10:01:08] <zoned> cherish, did you get it?
[10:01:12] <swiggy> this is a pain in the ass fuck the client!!!!! lol
[10:01:22] <zoned> swiggy, we've all been there... haha
[10:01:22] <swiggy> client = clientside*
[10:01:28] <zoned> oh
[10:02:35] <cherish> <zoned>:not quite.. tried it but may have got it wrong ..  http://pastebin.com/H1ZDgJQW
[10:03:46] <zoned> cherish, can you give each image a unique id? instead of #displayed img
[10:03:59] <zoned> what does 'desc' alert to?
[10:05:40] <djQuery> zoned: kinda. can you put together a jsbin or jsfiddle of the html at least?
[10:05:51] <Aquaguy> I have a bunch of 'a' elements in a variable called links. is there any way to get the link with the id 'foo' without using a for? something like links.('#foo') or whatever
[10:06:17] <Aquaguy> mm filter maybe?
[10:06:22] <zoned> the html is nothing more than a bunch of <input type='text' id='step0PC' /> ..... <input type='text' id='step30PC' />

[10:07:05] <djQuery> zoned: still dont want to have to type them out to create an example for you

[10:15:20] <bakers> Is there an opposite of closest? That descends the tree and finds all the matches?
[10:15:21] <zoned> zeropx, 'set in an extension' ??
[10:15:26] <bakers> children only goes one level deep?
[10:15:40] <djQuery> bakers: yes
[10:15:43] <zeropx> zoned: yeah. There are variables that I would like to call for another plugin
[10:16:00] <zeropx> something like this plugin https://github.com/zeropx/sliderton/blob/master/sliderton/sliderton.js
[10:16:03] <djQuery> bakers: .find goes infinite
[10:16:21] <zeropx> but would like to call current varaible out of there.
[10:16:33] <bakers> djQuery: Ahhh sweet
[10:18:53] <zeropx> It seems easy enought o create an extension, but still got a lot to learn with other things. such as calling those variables or sharing them

[10:24:50] <Jonah11_> For jquery tabs, what is the minimum set of googleapi includes I need?
[10:26:11] <kborchers> Jonah11_: if you are using the google cdn's you just use jquery, jqueryui and jqueryui css cdn's. if you want to minimize size, go to jqueryui.com and use the download builder and you can build a download that only includes the pieces you need for tabs.

[10:35:17] <njero> I can't figure out why.. or even where it goes
[10:35:38] <djQuery1> Jonah11_: well did you try copying and pasting the links into your browser? http://jqueryui.com/latest/themes/base/ui.all.css   doesnt work for me
[10:36:18] <Jonah11_> djQuery1, i got that from an example on the jquery site i believe
[10:36:25] <Jonah11_> how should i correct it?
[10:36:28] <kborchers> Jonah11_: if you aren't going to download the css use http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.15/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:37:03] <kborchers> and you can change base to any standard theme you want

[11:03:02] <djQuery1> here is the one I was looking for http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[11:04:50] <djQuery1> kborchers: ^^^  Iarfen:
[11:05:13] <djQuery1> and here http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[11:05:58] <djQuery1> kborchers[A]: ?
[11:06:19] <kborchers> ?
[11:08:01] <kborchers> djQuery: yeah, i know when to use each, what i was saying is below 1.6 i think it should be attr("checked", "checked")
[11:08:28] <djQuery> kborchers: to tell the truth dont remember
[11:08:46] <djQuery> kborchers: this [A] guy is annoying
[11:09:17] <kborchers> what do you mean?
[11:09:23] <djQuery> kborchers: I believe that attr('checked', 'anything you want here') is valid.
[11:10:00] <kborchers> meh, what ever. i'll just stick with latest and prop ;)
[11:10:04] <djQuery> kborchers: html just cares if the attribute is there or not. to uncheck something .removeAttr('checked')
[11:10:27] <djQuery> kborchers: yeah newest version for the win
[11:11:59] <datlap> How can I display {{ form.accountfirstname }} not as a form but just as a string
[11:12:05] <kborchers> what did you mean by <djQuery> kborchers: this [A] guy is annoying
[11:14:03] <djQuery> kborchers: when I type kb it autcompletes it with kborchers[A]
[11:14:28] <cherish> I have a image wrapper and some mousetraps that act as cursors prev and next.. upon clicking these they load the next or prev image in my img var but I have a longDescription: in there which holds some info for the product.  I need to get it so that when cursor is clicked it changes the info ... can anyone help?
[11:15:08] <kborchers> hmmm, really? my name switches to that when i mark myself as away ... need to just have it stop doing that. but it should autocomplete to the name that exists, no?
[11:15:11] <IanWizard> I know that I've seen a .timer() function before, but can't find it in the docs now.  (Maybe I'm just missing it.)  Can anyone confirm my sanity?
[11:15:32] <djQuery> dont even see you on the list of people
[11:15:42] <kborchers> weird
[11:15:46] <Patabugen> What did it do, IanWizard?
[11:16:04] <Patabugen> ( How did it differ from setTimeout() )
[11:16:16] <Aple> Hey guys, trying to .load(). Seems simple enough. I just can't get it to load anything. http://pressedweb.com/samples/glass4beer/details.php (click "The Eye")
[11:16:31] <BinaryKitten> IanWizard are you sure it wasn't a plugn?
[11:16:33] <Aple> $('#details_box').load('glass_data.html');
[11:16:35] <IanWizard> Patabugen, it repeated automatically.
[11:16:47] <Patabugen> Ah
[11:16:50] <Aple> It should be loading glass_data.html in #details_box right?
[11:17:22] <Patabugen> I've no idea then I'm afraid
[11:17:29] <IanWizard> Patabugen, you could set a timer to run some code every so often, without adding another setTimeout at the end.
[11:17:46] <BinaryKitten> IanWizard  like this? http://www.evanbyrne.com/article/jquery-timer-plugin
[11:18:37] <kborchers> djQuery: you see me now?
[11:19:53] <IanWizard> BinaryKitten, I sure thought it was a built-in.  (Like your nick BTW)
[11:20:17] <BinaryKitten> (thanks) not seen a timer one since it would be pointless in core
[11:20:28] <BinaryKitten> js handles that perfectly by default..
[11:20:36] <BinaryKitten> setTimeout for 1 shot
[11:20:41] <BinaryKitten> setInterval for repeat
[11:21:02] <BinaryKitten> both of which return a reference for the timer call..
[11:21:24] <BinaryKitten> to clear/stop them you can use clearTimeout and clearInterval passing it the reference
[11:22:09] <BinaryKitten> eg var myTimer = setInterval(function() { console.log('hey'); }, 5000);
[11:22:31] <BinaryKitten> will log out "hey" every 5 seconds
[11:24:29] <ccmonster> hows things going peoples
[11:24:53] <Brodingo> very well
[11:27:34] <dr34mc0d3r> is there an event handler i can attach to dor detecting when .data  changes ite value?  $("div").data("lastValue")
[11:30:11] <b1lly> var orderNeedBy = 'Date\(1234)\';                             i basically want to parse it and return '1234'. i'm doing this, which is returning '1234)\'... thoughts? orderNeedBy.substr(orderNeedBy.indexOf('(')+1, orderNeedBy.indexOf(')')-1))
[11:37:11] <donburks> b1lly: orderNeedBy.split('(')[1].split(')')[0]
[11:38:54] <Cherish_> I have created an image array which provide the src images to a script. I have then appended some information to image and when the thumbnail is clicked it adds the relevant information into a div I have called #dressinfo  I have some cursors that work as a kind of mousetrap which are .cursorLeft and .cursorRight.   What I need is when the cursor is clicked I need the previous infomation or the next information to replace the curren
[11:39:11] <Cherish_> could anyone help?
[11:40:43] <donburks> Cherish_: What do you mean by 'appended some information to image'?
[11:41:45] <Cherish_> <donburks> sorry wrong word really..  I need to be able to when a cursor is clicked , it shows the relevant information from the image var.
[11:42:21] <donburks> Cherish_: URL? Fiddle? Pastebin?
[11:42:43] <Cherish_> <donburks> I can pastebin some of the info ....
[11:43:06] <donburks> Please.
[11:44:23] <ccmonster> dr34mc0d3r, what you need again?
[11:44:28] <ccmonster> just do a check.
[11:44:34] <Aple> Anyone know why these aren't fading out, clearing the div, loading new content, then fading back in (in that order)? http://pressedweb.com/samples/glass4beer/details.php
[11:44:47] <ccmonster> if( data is diff than my last saved ver. of data){// do something}
[11:44:48] <Aple> $('#detail_box').fadeOut().html('').load('glass_data.html #eye').fadeIn();
[11:45:07] <ccmonster> throw in a bounce/debounce or delay
[11:45:17] <ccmonster> there is lots on this online about animations chaining
[11:45:41] <b1lly> donburks: why wasnt my substring method working?
[11:45:45] <ccmonster> and you aren't clearing there. you are are just fadingout, then loading ew stuff
[11:45:49] <donburks> Put everything after the fadeOut() in a callback function to run when it finishes.
[11:46:09] <ccmonster> $('#detail_box').fadeOut().empty().load('glass_data.html #eye').fadeIn();
[11:46:39] <donburks> b1lly: Because the number of characters you need isn't the same as the position of the last ) character.
[11:46:53] <Aple> ccmonster: So how does that bounce/debounce stuff work? What is that? What's causing this problem?
[11:47:02] <donburks> b1lly: My way is string-length agnostic.
[11:47:51] <Aple> ccmonster: With .delay(500) chained in there, it still "bounces"
[11:48:08] <ccmonster> as donburks is suggesting, $('#detail_box').fadeout(function(e){$self = $(this); $self.empty();$self.load('stufftoload.html')}).fadeIn()
[11:48:12] <ccmonster> i think is what he means
[11:48:40] <donburks> ccmonster: Yep, that's what I meant. :) Thank you for translating.
[11:48:59] <Bruce_> HELLO ALL . Can anybody can tell me how to send a resize command to a JQ resizable box , from a js code (ex : resize(x,h)) THANKS
[11:49:01] <donburks> You could even put the .fadeIn() inside the function.
[11:49:16] <roger_padactor> trying this. $('input [name="token"]')  i get  [] but if i jsut do $('input') the one im trying to get shows up in the list of inputs.  the name is token. don't know what im doing wrong
[11:49:18] <ccmonster> yep. i just want to show him that way.
[11:49:28] <ccmonster> so he could see the logic
[11:49:35] <donburks> roger_padactor: Take out the space between input and [
[11:49:38] <Cherish_> <donburks>:if your on the site you will see that if you click the thumbnail .. I have got the dressinfo div to update with the longDescription but not sure how to do the same when cursorLeft and cursorRight are clicked.
[11:49:43] <ccmonster> Aple, do you understand what we mean by callback?
[11:49:54] <Aple> Not really :)
[11:49:58] <ccmonster> haha
[11:49:59] <Aple> They've always eluded me
[11:50:00] <ccmonster> ?callback
[11:50:00] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[11:50:01] <Aple> lol
[11:50:06] <donburks> Cherish_: What site?
[11:50:08] <ccmonster> booh. damn bot
[11:50:23] <ccmonster> callback basically means, this is what will happen after this function occurs
[11:50:33] <Cherish_> http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride.html
[11:50:39] <Aple> So I don't need that debounce plugin right?
[11:51:06] <ccmonster> so in out .fadeOut(speed,callback) example, all that stuff I did in the function(e){....} part occurs AFTER the fadeOut finishes.
[11:51:09] <cherish> <donburks> some more info at http://pastebin.com/eGCEnyNE
[11:51:14] <ccmonster> when you chain, sometimes things get 'jumpy'
[11:51:19] <ccmonster> when it comes to animations
[11:51:27] <Aple> Gotcha
[11:51:32] <Bruce_> HELLO ALL . Can anybody can tell me how to send a resize command to a JQ resizable box , from a js code (ex : resize(x,h)) THANKS
[11:51:50] <ccmonster> so if you properly utilize the callbacks, you are ensuring the process is better 'stepped through'
[11:52:19] <ccmonster> animations + (callbacks||delays|debounces) = smooth animations + happy dev
[11:52:50] <ccmonster> just chaining animations one after another just isn't guarenteed to work smoothly, even though it's suppose to.
[11:53:20] <Bruce_> HELLO ALL . Can anybody can tell me how to send a resize command to a JQ resizable box , from a js code (ex : resize(x,h)) THANKS
[11:53:22] <ccmonster> and Aple , dont get the debounce plugins until you try the callback method
[11:53:38] <ccmonster> did you read the jquery-ui resizable docs?
[11:53:50] <Aple> $('#detail_box').fadeOut( 'slow', $('#detail_box').empty().delay(2000).load('glass_data.html #eye').fadeIn() ); doesn't work much better
[11:54:11] <Aple> As in, doesn't fade out
[11:55:19] <Bruce_> ccmonster : yes i read but a do not understand, im newbee in js. U just want to risize my REZISABLE when i clic a buton ex resoze(w,h)
[11:55:30] <kborchers> Aple: do $('#detail_box').fadeOut( 'slow', function() {$('#detail_box').empty().delay(2000).load('glass_data.html #eye').fadeIn();} );
[11:56:38] <Aple> I got it to work by putting it in an actual function
[11:56:40] <ccmonster> ok
[11:56:44] <cherish> <donburks> not sure if you got any of that as my browser was  playing up
[11:56:49] <Aple> kborchers: yah :)
[11:57:14] <Aple> Anyone have time to explain why $('#detail_box').empty().delay(500).load('glass_data.html #eye').fadeIn() doesn't work, but wrapping it as a function does?
[11:57:19] <ccmonster> you could make a function that takes a element, and a speed and does a fade & empty
[11:57:25] <ccmonster> nice little util functino to reuse possible
[11:57:30] <ccmonster> possibly*
[11:57:47] <ccmonster> because it's in the callback
[11:57:52] <ccmonster> the way kborchers is showing you
[11:58:00] <kborchers> Aple: because you are defining a callback function there, not just providing arbitrary code.
[11:58:08] <Bruce_> HELLO ALL . Can anybody can tell me how to send a resize command to a JQ resizable box , from a js code (ex : resize(x,h)) THANKS
[11:58:23] <kborchers> you have to pass a reference to a function
[11:58:37] <ccmonster> Bruce_, ...dont keep reposting so frequently pleae
[11:59:07] <ccmonster> what do you want to do that is different than the demos? or what demo are you trying to duplicate?
[11:59:35] <Bruce_> helpme please, i so simple for guys like you, just want to do a resize(w,h)
[12:00:22] <Bruce_> the demo creates a bloc with size. done. but i whant to change dynamicly the size, by code
[12:00:29] <zoned> .
[12:01:01] <ScottO_> does jquery UI often come with trailing whitespace?
[12:01:44] <aaronw-1> soooo
[12:01:52] <aaronw-1> how do I do a 'not' regex?
[12:01:59] <Aple> Cool, thanks guys.
[12:02:05] <aaronw-1> I want all elements of an array that do not include the word 'failed'
[12:02:05] <Aple> Works smooth now.
[12:02:08] <ccmonster> neg lookahead
[12:02:14] <ccmonster> wrap it in a NOT
[12:02:15] <aaronw-1> where choices could be primary, secondary, tertiary, failed, allowed, etc
[12:02:25] <Bruce_> ccmonster, help me in private irc please
[12:02:32] <Aple> So a rule of thumb is, "If something is 'bouncing', look for the fadeout and add a callback function
[12:02:38] <sirblade> halp, are the ajax shorthand methods .get .post .getscript .getjson etc deprecated?
[12:02:52] <aaronw-1> sirblade, not to my knowledge, why do you ask?
[12:02:56] <aaronw-1> I use .getjson frequently
[12:03:13] <ScottO_> where is the developer channel for UI?
[12:03:15] <sirblade> my colleauges @work swear they  are
[12:03:24] <sirblade> orly
[12:03:35] <aaronw-1> what do they advocate instead of .getjson?
[12:03:42] <aaronw-1> using .ajax and filling out all the fields manually?
[12:03:44] <sirblade> .ajax
[12:03:47] <aaronw-1> that seems.... lame and stupid
[12:03:48] <sirblade> yeah
[12:04:03] <sirblade> is it more efficient maybe
[12:04:05] <ScottO_> sirblade: be sure not to trust some random person on the internet also
[12:04:08] <aaronw-1> well
[12:04:12] <aaronw-1> define 'more efficient'
[12:04:26] <aaronw-1> if you wanted to do everything efficiently, you wouldn't even use a framework
[12:04:27] <sirblade> less function stacks
[12:04:29] <donburks> cherish: Sorry, got called afk. Will look in one sec.
[12:04:44] <ccmonster> #jquery-ui i think
[12:04:58] <Cherish_> <donburks> Thanks.. its much appreciated..
[12:04:59] <sirblade> hmm ok
[12:05:03] <aaronw-1> sirblade, if your application is such that using .getjson vs .ajax will make a substantial difference in execution time, you're optimizing in the wrong way
[12:05:03] <sirblade> tx
[12:05:09] <b1lly> is there a way to format a javascript Date object? to look like this (Aug-11/3:05PM)
[12:05:11] <some_random_pers> ScottO_: y? not trust me?
[12:05:15] <acochran> anyone know how I can simulate a window resize (so I can fire a function that only gets called on window resize)?
[12:05:16] <janthony> If I have character-count-255 - is there a way to grab only the 255?
[12:05:25] <ccmonster> ?jquery date format
[12:05:27] <bot-t> ccmonster, jquery-dateFormat | jQuery Plugins - The jQuery Date Format plugin enables the formatting and parsing of dates. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-dateFormat
[12:05:50] <janthony> Like with php I would explode by - and grab the last index, but not sure how to do that with javascript/jquery
[12:05:54] <ccmonster> just google jquery date formatting, there is a string representation you can pass that changes the input/output of the date obj
[12:06:08] <ccmonster> .slice & indexof?
[12:06:55] <Cherish_> Can anyone tell me the best image gallery plugin  for use on Iphone or Ipad..  for a webapp when I get round to it using JqMobile
[12:07:20] <donburks> Cherish_: A couple of style/syntax notes to begin with. When setting multiple attr's, you can pass an object: .attr({src: foo.src, title: foo.title, alt: foo.alt})
[12:07:22] <ccmonster> var newstr = myString.slice(0,myString.indexOf('-'))
[12:07:52] <Cherish_> <donburks> ah sorry.. should have already changed that sorry
[12:08:02] <donburks> Cherish_ : NP. Just sayin'
[12:08:29] <Cherish_> <donburks> thanks for pointing out..
[12:08:51] <djQuery> Cherish_ you can even do $('<div></div>', {title: 'hey', text: 'hello world'}).appendTo('body');
[12:10:12] <Cherish_> <djQuery>, thanks thats one worth remembering.
[12:10:57] <donburks> Cherish_: Also, instead of doing $(this).is('.cursorRight') more syntactically correct would be $(this).hasClass('.cursorRight')
[12:11:50] <Cherish_> <donburks> thanks will amend that one.. :)
[12:12:05] <donburks> Cherish_: You seem to already have a fn for displaying the longDescription. In your .click for the cursorLeft/Right, you just need to call that fn and pass it the index.
[12:12:57] <Cherish_> <donburks> thats where I am failing.... just need a little assistance..

[12:17:04] <initself> i want to do something like data.matches
[12:17:08] <initself> what would be the right syntax?

[12:18:51] <initself> djQuery: I am not sure I am following
[12:19:00] <initself> for (var key in data('matches')) { is what I tried.  .data is syntax error?
[12:19:30] <djQuery> Cherish_ why not just create a global var $thumb  then later you can get it via $thumb.get(somenumber)
[12:20:17] <initself> data is not a function. :(

[12:31:06] <ccmonster> you doing cross domain json call blindMoe ?
[12:31:13] <brianpWins> When you bind a method to a form input element does it also bind to the form element itself?

[12:31:23] <jugstah> wtf is #php invite only
[12:31:26] <jugstah> that's dumb
[12:31:36] <ccmonster> you need to be identified on the netword jugstah
[12:31:40] <ccmonster> that's all
[12:31:54] <ccmonster>  . /nickserve identify your username password
[12:31:59] <brianpWins> jugstah:  I just joined php no problem
[12:32:05] <ccmonster> and if you havent, you gotta set up your nickserve account
[12:32:10] <jugstah> what? my identd's broke?
[12:32:22] <albertos_> any idea blindMoe??
[12:33:03] <brianpWins> werid if I unbind the event then bind it doesn't fire twice. but I'm only binding it once so thats pretty messed up
[12:33:10] <janthony> Is there a way to do a wildcard with hasClass? if($(this).hasClass('count-max-*')) { console.log('test'); } for example. the star representing the wild card.
[12:33:18] <blindMoe> albertos_: sounds like there is an option to switch between images using the mousewheel ( same as the trackpad )
[12:33:34] <Xeon06_> Hey all
[12:33:45] <Xeon06_> Is there any way to test for selector equality? ie: $("body") == $("body")
[12:33:49] <albertos_> i just went through all the options in the docs and nothing :(
[12:33:50] <blindMoe> ccmonster: is there an actual .getJSONP function?  I don't find much on the net for it.. seems like everything points towards .getJSON
[12:33:54] <ccmonster> callback=?
[12:33:59] <ccmonster> you need that at the end of your url
[12:34:15] <ccmonster> or, use the $.ajax method and set the type as jsonp
[12:34:15] <jugstah> bah, i dont own this shell box so i dont know about nickserve
[12:34:21] <jugstah> but any php-fu guys here?
[12:34:24] <ccmonster> sorry to here jugstah
[12:34:31] <blindMoe> ccmonster: that is what I was trying initially and I got the same result :/
[12:34:57] <jugstah> i need the ability to go back and forth between pages using a prev/next button and not have the browser ask me if i need to reload the page
[12:36:07] <ccmonster> look up the $.ajax docs, and check out the cross-domain and jsonp parts specifically
[12:36:25] <ccmonster> jsonp / cross domain stuff can be wonky, because it's sort of a hack in general.
[12:36:30] <ccmonster> if i understand correctly.
[12:39:15] <djQuery> Cherish_: something like this http://jsbin.com/omusiw/edit#javascript,html,live
[12:40:02] <djQuery> Cherish_ small correction http://jsbin.com/omusiw/2/edit
[12:41:27] <prax> is there anything like jslint to check jquery for errors?
[12:41:52] <djQuery> prax: well theres jslint?
[12:42:10] <ccmonster> jquery is javascript, so you can look at some douglas crockford stuff
[12:42:15] <janthony> $(this).attr('class'); - this returns 'character-count max-count-255 clear-fix form-field field-couponname form-field-textarea' - any idea how I can grab max-count-255 from this where max-count is the only it's looking for, leaving out the -255?
[12:42:16] <prax> hmm okay I guess I am just really bad at this.. =)
[12:42:29] <prax> it didn't seem to like my code because it was jquery
[12:42:47] <ccmonster> you can also audit(chrome)|profile(firefox firebug) your js in the browsers
[12:43:02] <djQuery> janthony: by putting it where it goes in the  first place? <input max-length="255"
[12:43:16] <ccmonster> did it throw up on everything? and are you including your jquery library before your script?
[12:43:38] <janthony> djQuery: That is not what this does. The selector is used for something else.
[12:43:39] <prax> yes, I included it
[12:44:00] <prax> have to use jquery over prototype for magento Go.. not sure if that is what the problem is
[12:44:00] <ccmonster> before the script you've written?
[12:44:03] <prax> $.noConflict();
[12:44:03] <prax> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[12:44:03] <prax> if ( $("body").hasClass("catalog-product-view") ) {
[12:44:03] <prax> / Basically Find out if this is a product page then do stuff
[12:44:03] <prax> var checkedArray = {
[12:44:04] <prax> 'checkedIDOne',
[12:44:06] <prax> 'checkedIDTwo',
[12:44:08] <prax> 'CheckedIDThree'
[12:44:10] <prax> };
[12:44:12] <prax> $.each(checkedArray, function() {
[12:44:14] <prax> if ( $("input#"+this).prop("checked") == false ) {
[12:44:15] <ccmonster> $?
[12:44:16] <prax> / If the checkbox is not checked
[12:44:18] <prax> $("input#"+this).prop("checked", true); // Check it
[12:44:18] <ccmonster> ?demo
[12:44:19] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:44:20] <prax> }
[12:44:22] <prax> });
[12:44:24] <prax> }
[12:44:24] <ccmonster> do not paste in the room please
[12:44:26] <prax> o crap sorry
[12:44:30] <prax> mean to post link
[12:44:32] <prax> I'm sorry I know I didn;t mean to
[12:44:36] <djQuery> prax: well I assume that the 255 part is a variable so it shouldnt be in the class it shoule be in data then data-maxlength="255"
[12:44:39] <Snerf> $.getJSON parses from a URL, any way I can just parse it with JSON data I already have in a local variable?
[12:44:48] <prax> http://piratepad.net/NnKYajZPTY
[12:44:54] <janthony> Any other answers? I'm thinking I need to use regex
[12:45:02] <prax> http://shop.vapelicious.com/oakwood-tobacco
[12:45:38] <prax> just trying to set some default values.. think I might need to go re-enable jquery at this moment but thought I might just be missing a }); in the code someone could identify
[12:45:52] <ccmonster> use jsfiddle.net praz
[12:45:54] <ccmonster> prax
[12:46:47] <hiosilver> Hello
[12:47:43] <hiosilver> How can I make that $('element').click(function() {} makes all of the elements of input[type=checkbox] value is checked?
[12:48:34] <prax> jsfiddle is turning one set of curly braces green.. what does that mean? sorry for the uber-noobishness
[12:48:46] <prax> http://jsfiddle.net/uzSau/
[12:49:48] <hiosilver> prax: I think that's normal
[12:49:58] <hiosilver> it's like a friendly helper
[12:51:20] <prax> it's only one set though and firebug tells me the error is "missing } after function body"
[12:52:03] <prax> yeah I see what you mean now though
[12:52:14] <prax> as I clicked around it shows each set of braces
[12:52:59] <prax> I think maybe Magento Go just doesn't like what I am trying to do maybe
[12:53:13] <prax> it's very weird it doesn't like minified jQuery
[12:53:26] <ccmonster> dont use min during dev
[12:53:36] <prax> I have some weird 1.4.2-min someone else made and it is like minified but broken up into some arbitrary lines
[12:53:50] <prax> oh okay.. well separate issue I spose
[12:53:54] <ciss> i'm dynamically loading multiple script files via getScript()/ajax() inside each(). how can i fire a single callback after *all* scripts have been loaded?
[12:54:01] <ccmonster> cant yo use the newer stuff? like ..1.6*?
[12:54:09] <ccmonster> complete?
[12:54:22] <ccmonster> calback
[12:54:31] <prax> yes, I guess I will do that now. I just expected the min 1.6.2 to work fine but I will try that
[12:54:49] <ccmonster> and what sort of errors are you geting ?
[12:54:50] <djQuery> prax: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[12:55:07] <ciss> i could use queue(), but then i'd lose the advantage of loading multiple files simultaneously
[12:55:21] <hiosilver> What I actually meant is that I need to make all of input type check box checked when I click a button, how should I do that?
[12:56:26] <djQuery> ciss: var completecount = somearray.lenth;   then in the success of each one decrement completecount and check to see if it is = 0 then do something else
[12:57:07] <ciss> djQuery: sounds good, thanks
[12:59:11] <prax> nope, non-minified is throwing what looks like the same errors
[12:59:17] <prax> http://shop.vapelicious.com/oakwood-tobacco
[12:59:20] <ccmonster> what ar ethose errors again?
[12:59:31] <ccmonster> nvm, going there
[13:00:04] <prax> thanks so much, my support basically refused to help me even when I said I couldn't even just get basic jquery to load
[13:00:44] <initself> this appears to only want to replace the first +
[13:00:45] <initself> q.prod_num = q.prod_num.replace("+", " ");
[13:00:49] <initself> how do i replace all of them?
[13:00:59] <initself> replaceAll maybe!
[13:01:06] <ciss> initself: /+/g
[13:01:07] <austen> I need to add some ctrlKey + keycode combinations, I was wondering if I can override browser default behavior like ctrlKey+S
[13:01:11] <janthony> Does .eq only work on element objects? I'm getting a .eq is not a function error in console when I do var test = $(this).attr('class').split(' ').eq(1);
[13:01:13] <ciss> initself: /\+/g
[13:01:54] <austen> Trying to keep the browser "save page as" dialog from coming up.
[13:02:27] <initself> ciss++ # q.prod_num = q.prod_num.replace(/\+/g, " ");
[13:06:37] <Danny_Joris> Hi all. In a jQuery function how would you put $(this) into a variable if you have to use $(this) multitple times?
[13:06:42] <Danny_Joris> var this wouldn't work right?
[13:06:48] <Danny_Joris> or var $this?
[13:07:34] <prax> can you tell what is going on ccmonster?
[13:07:36] <phlp> var $this = $(this);
[13:08:17] <Danny_Joris> phlp: thanks, I wasn't sure about that one, because in zend 'this' still changes markup color to blue...
[13:08:37] <ciss> Danny_Joris: also common: var obj, var el
[13:08:38] <Danny_Joris> as an example, 'var' lights up blue
[13:13:04] <ccmonster> whats the best way to check if a object is undefined?
[13:13:26] <Danny_Joris> phlp , ciss: thanks!
[13:13:42] <janthony> var maxcount = $(this).attr('class').split(' ')[1].split('-')[2]; - got working. Thanks anyways.
[13:14:07] <prax> still makes no sense to me why Magento Go only likes this weird "minified" 1.4.2 but nothing else http://jsfiddle.net/32B6J/
[13:14:35] <prax> it's like it needs to be broken up some certain way??
[13:14:40] <ccmonster> no clue prax.
[13:16:57] <ccmonster> prax, line 99, 214, 593, and 607 in your .html seem to start the error
[13:17:32] <prax> hmm okay I will check that out but there is so much stuff hardcoded I can't touch
[13:17:34] <ccmonster> prax, i would put in a break point on line 99, and walk through it
[13:18:04] <prax> well I found somethign new and interesting
[13:18:29] <prax> went back to the 1.4.2 that doesn't give errors and added a }); at the end of my custom script and I get a new error
[13:19:38] <prax> also since I don't even have access to the HTML I can't easily tell what line 99 is
[13:20:32] <devinrolsen> prax having worked with Magento for least a few years now.. that is the least weird thing you will run into.
[13:20:38] <devinrolsen> especially with the GO version ;)
[13:21:00] <prax> I really think I should give up hope and stop messing with this
[13:21:07] <prax> it just seems like it should be so easy to do
[13:21:13] <devinrolsen> you do know that Mage was bought by ebay last month right?
[13:21:17] <prax> yes
[13:21:35] <devinrolsen> I anticipate it to be dissolved and sold by this time next year.
[13:21:52] <prax> I don't follow
[13:22:54] <meredydd> hey, any jq-mobile people here? (I might possibly want a dev)
[13:22:55] <necromancer> can I separate classes in .addClass or does it just take 1 per ()?
[13:22:59] <prax> anyhow thanks for trying to help guys, I give up
[13:23:03] <necromancer> like can i do .addClass('active button play')?
[13:23:20] <Sean-Der> if ($product == "edge")  {numloop = numloop + 20}
[13:23:32] <meredydd> I can't seem to successfully add a <li> into an existing <ul> with jQuery Mobile
[13:23:34] <chovy> meredydd: i've used it.
[13:23:43] <chovy> meredydd: http://clsearch.org/m
[13:23:51] <Sean-Der> Is this the proper way to check if var $product == the string edge?
[13:24:00] <Sean-Der> and if so do the math following?
[13:24:11] <Sean-Der> It wrecks everything don't get what its doing
[13:24:15] <meredydd> Triggering the 'create' event works when adding other sorts of content
[13:24:24] <mrgreenfur> I have a quick, maybe stupid question. What do ya'll do with jquery-ui tabs and inline anchors? Is there a way to simulate inline anchors instead of letting the browser do it?
[13:24:44] <phlp> ?js $('<div>').addClass('foo bar dog').hasClass('bar') @ necromancer
[13:24:45] <bot-t1> necromancer: false
[13:25:03] <phlp> bot-t1: i was looking for true
[13:25:04] <bot-t1> phlp, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[13:26:04] <meredydd> chovy, Have you ever inserted list items dynamically?

[13:50:31] <iateadonut> sigboxid is a variable.  how would i write this: getElementById(sigboxid)   in jquery?
[13:50:58] <kborchers> $("#sigboxid");
[13:51:05] <erichynds> $("#" + sigboxid);
[13:51:07] <iateadonut> sigboxid is a varialbe, though
[13:51:09] <iateadonut> thanks.
[13:51:14] <kborchers> doh, my bad
[13:51:19] <erichynds> $(document.getElementById(sigboxid))
[13:51:35] <iateadonut> ooh... that easy, huh?  thanks.
[13:51:49] <erichynds> did you are unimpressed? and now?
[13:52:43] <z3yo> Hi there
[13:52:58] <z3yo> How to take off the css of DOM elements ?
[13:53:13] <iateadonut> i am extremely impressed with jquery.
[13:53:31] <iateadonut> when i learned about jquery ajax, i think i might've cried.
[13:54:03] <erichynds> z3yo: removeClass or change the css properties via .css()
[13:54:09] <erichynds> you can't just blow it away
[13:58:21] <kborchers> z3yo: i wonder if you could do something like $("elementToRemoveCSSFrom").replaceWith($("elementToRemoveCSSFrom").clone().attr("style", "")[0]);
[13:58:28] <kborchers> not tested, just off the top of myhead
[13:59:56] <watchedman> hey jQuery fam
[13:59:57] <watchedman> i'm having a confusing issue...i have a URL that when visited, generates a CSV file on the backend based on some session variable values. I want to use jQuery to trigger this via Ajax when a button is clicked. I can't figure out how to get that to work, is it simple to do so?
[14:00:30] <watchedman> when i put the url directly into the browser address bar it works, but when i call it via $.post nothing happens
[14:00:43] <ravenzz> ?ajax @ watchedman
[14:00:43] <bot-t1> watchedman, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:00:54] <ravenzz> ?demo @ watchedman
[14:00:55] <bot-t1> watchedman, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:01:51] <iateadonut> try $.post
[14:02:00] <iateadonut> oh, woops.
[14:02:42] <iateadonut> can you show us in a pastebin the line that works in the browser, and also what you are calling with post?
[14:02:53] <iateadonut> with $.post, rather
[14:02:57] <james13433> if Im using an "a" tag just to be clicked, say to show a popup, should I have the href as "#" or "" or have no href?
[14:04:07] <ravenzz> james13433 place the correct href..you need that to respenct the web standards, and then look at this
[14:04:12] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ james13433
[14:04:13] <bot-t1> james13433, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[14:05:24] <james13433> revenzz whats the correct href "#" ?
[14:05:59] <ravenzz> dunno... you should think at the worst environment, where you will not have css an JS
[14:06:24] <ravenzz> what that link is supposed to do?
[14:06:25] <james13433> right ok, so just pretend its a text only browser
[14:06:48] <z3yo> kborchers, .attr("style","") works ;) thx
[14:07:00] <james13433> well its a few things, images and to show tooptips
[14:07:01] <watchedman> Hey all i did the best to explain my problem on this pastebin:
[14:07:02] <watchedman> http://dpaste.com/592326/
[14:07:18] <kborchers> that by itself won't remove styles applied but a stylesheet though z3yo
[14:07:27] <iateadonut> i have a problem where i'm using draggable on two graphics that rest on a third graphic.  graphic2 has a higher z-index than graphic1, so when graphic1 is dragged and the cursor is on top of graphic2 when the mouse button is let go, the function that is called by clicking on graphic2 is not called.
[14:08:09] <iateadonut> using jquery UI, of course, for draggable.
[14:09:33] <chovy> meredydd: yes
[14:10:11] <kborchers> iateadonut: do you want 1 behind 2 while dragging? seems like you should swap z-indexes in the start event to make sure the one dragging is higher
[14:10:42] <iateadonut> definitely want 1 behind 2
[14:11:04] <ravenzz> james13433 then you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/jeNMa/
[14:11:05] <iateadonut> just figured out a simple solution, though - i'll have both the functions that are triggered by both graphics called when either of them is onclicked.
[14:11:48] <james13433> ok thanks ravenzz, what about if it was just an "x" to close the tooptip?
[14:12:07] <james13433> ahh just dont have it as a link
[14:12:08] <iateadonut> which happens to work in this situation, but might not work in a lot of other ones.
[14:12:09] <james13433> ok cool;
[14:12:46] <ChrisBuchholz> I wonder, is my only chance of finder a good "drag-to-sort" plugin for jquery, by using one from jquery ui? I really want a plugin that only depends on jquery, since i dont need jquery ui for anything else,
[14:13:30] <kborchers> ChrisBuchholz so use the download builder to only pull the pieces need for sortable
[14:16:14] <iateadonut> d'oh!  that made a huge loop.  is there a onclickup kind of function?
[14:16:48] <kborchers> iateadonut: check out the stop event in draggable
[14:16:58] <IanWizard-Cloud> iateadonut: weird nick.  Yes, I believe it is buttonup
[14:17:12] <IanWizard-Cloud> iateadonut: I may be wrong though.
[14:18:30] <kborchers> IanWizard-Cloud: you are thinking of mouseup but that won't work either ... it will fire on the top image, not the one that was dragged. iateadonut: use draggable stop event
[14:23:13] <teamcoltra_work> I am looking for a simple way to remove a class if there is anything in it. Basically something like class=redbackground when there is no text/dropdown (value != "")
[14:24:06] <teamcoltra_work> I hacked together some examples and got http://paste2.org/p/1579272 but that doesn't work
[14:25:08] <dabear> teamcoltra_work: ok, it doesn't work. so why are you using $(this) there?
[14:25:23] <dabear> $(this) will be the same as $(window) in that context
[14:25:40] <teamcoltra_work> I don't know thats just what the example used :\
[14:25:57] <dabear> right
[14:26:09] <dabear> we are not here to code for you
[14:26:21] <dabear> but to help
[14:26:25] <teamcoltra_work> I am a complete idiot when it comes to javascript (probably one of those things that I should learn). I am not asking for people to do the work for me, but put me in the right direction
[14:26:33] <dabear> to help you, you must your self understand the basics
[14:26:36] <kborchers> teamcoltra_work: $("input[type='text'], select").change(...
[14:26:44] <kborchers> i'm feeling generous
[14:27:28] <teamcoltra_work> kborchers: not to sound like orphan annie but would that work on drop-downs?
[14:27:46] <kborchers> uh ... select
[14:28:19] <kborchers> as long as the selected option has a value other than ""
[14:28:52] <iateadonut> one right direction is to get o'reilly's books on jquery and javascript, i particularly like the cookbooks - a half off e-books coupon is '4cast'
[14:29:01] <iateadonut> the definitive guides are also good, and they might be at your library.
[14:29:23] <iateadonut> those you can sit down and read.  the cookbooks are useful as a reference, so they are good to have an e-copy
[14:29:44] <iateadonut> and of course, kborchers seems pretty helpful
[14:29:51] <kborchers> ;)
[14:30:16] <kborchers> i'm about to sign off though ... books don't do that ;p
[14:31:34] <teamcoltra_work> kborchers: thanks. iateadonut: I normally don't use javascript, I just work on actual code. Also I appreciate you guys helping, though I think it is a little bit.... aggressive... to just say "wow you suck, go read a book and come back" I thought I was getting the understanding right, so had someone said "well this is wrong because of this" it becomes much easier to learn
[14:32:07] <teamcoltra_work> none the less I appreciate the help
[14:32:13] <kborchers> javascript isn't actual code
[14:32:15] <kborchers> ?
[14:33:15] <teamcoltra_work> LOL sorry
[14:34:09] <iateadonut> well, didn't mean to offend if i did, but those books have been invaluable to me.
[14:34:21] <kborchers> and not to be too ... aggressive ... but no one said you suck. i thought iateadonut was actually very helpful in his book suggestions
[14:34:22] <teamcoltra_work> I meant I work on actual backend code (Which I guess JS could do backend stuff too on rare occasion) I hardly even work with HTML.
[14:34:26] <iateadonut> plus oreilly pays me to be in these chatrooms and give out the discount coupons.
[14:34:36] <iateadonut> (not really)
[14:34:41] <teamcoltra_work> iateadonut: was great, thats not who I was pointing out
[14:35:28] <teamcoltra_work> I just keep fumbling over my words, I am not upset at anyone. I don't care, I just came in to get some help, and I was put on the right direction. I am happy for that.
[14:35:53] <kborchers> oh, i see. yeah, sometimes people do get frustrated in here (me included sometimes) since a lot of people just want us to do the work for them
[14:36:01] <kborchers> glad we could help you though
[14:36:07] <necromancer> lol
[14:36:28] <necromancer> "yeah i work on REAL programming languages"
[14:36:34] <necromancer> "unlike your script kiddie bullshit"
[14:36:43] <teamcoltra_work> LOL certainly not what I meant.
[14:36:45] <necromancer> ;)
[14:36:52] <necromancer> teamcoltra_work: what languages do you work in normally?
[14:37:15] <iateadonut> necromancer, my handle used to be 'secretlydead', and one time someone insulted me by calling me a necromancer.  i was like, 'what the hell is a necromancer and why do i have to use a dictionary to understand when someone insults me?'
[14:37:18] <teamcoltra_work> I do shitty PHP backend work for my job (mainly interfacing with MySQL)
[14:37:48] <kborchers> later all
[14:37:50] <teamcoltra_work> :) Now they said "oh you do PHP our other guy isn't doing so good we want you to do it" and so... now I am lost
[14:40:28] <grid_> i just used document.getElementById('bgimg').src = ""; instead of this i now use $('#bgimg').attr('src', ''); but that will not work with chrome, what could i use?
[14:40:47] <donburks> Of course it will work with Chrome.
[14:41:24] <grid_> i'm using it because i later set a var for the div, later i change it back to another img with other dimensions
[14:41:50] <grid_> otherwise the img will get other dimensions, that won't be good for visitors to see
[14:41:50] <iateadonut> teamcoltra_work, wow, that's great.
[14:42:00] <grid_> donburks: got a better solution?
[14:42:09] <iateadonut> so if you just study your butt off, you'll be a pretty good php programmer within a few months.
[14:42:30] <donburks> grid_: Yes. Use a class for the dimensions. Unset one and set the other.
[14:43:01] <grid_> i'm working with a very nice jquery plugin, http://nanotux.com/plugins/fullscreenr/index.html (the only one that i found that works even with ie8 too)
[14:44:04] <grid_> donburks: it's like 	<img id="bgimg" src="img/bg.jpg" /> and the script will work with that settings, i don't want to spend to much time to change everything
[14:45:50] <grid_> donburks: i'm doing now like http://jsfiddle.net/CrWUm/ and i want the second line to be jquery too
[14:46:39] <donburks> grid_: So rather than blanking the src and then resetting it, why not just reset it?
[14:50:15] <grid_> donburks: how you do that with jquery?
[14:51:23] <BinaryKitten> why use jquery at all?
[14:51:39] <BinaryKitten> seems a bit overkill for 1 attribute change
[14:51:45] <donburks> You're already doing it. That's your like $("#bgimg").attr('src', 'blahblahblah');
[14:51:46] <grid_> good question, atleast i think because my site is full of it
[14:51:58] <donburks> Biggest rock is not always best rock.
[14:52:04] <z3yo> good night all
[14:53:03] <grid_> BinaryKitten: well, ok it is less code, it's also a reason, but i could hook up with document.getElementById('bgimg').src = ""; too
[14:53:08] <grid_> but jquery i like more
[14:53:40] <teamcoltra_work> Hey guys... couldn't I just do onchange="removeClass('redwarning')" on my dropdowns and text forms?
[14:53:59] <BinaryKitten> grid_  less code != better code
[14:54:10] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/CrWUm/1/
[14:54:38] <BinaryKitten> in reality that's the fastest code version you can get for what you're after
[14:55:03] <BinaryKitten> oops
[14:55:12] <BinaryKitten> var bgimg   instead of var img
[14:55:17] <BinaryKitten> sorry it's late here
[15:00:46] <grid_> BinaryKitten: it seems like it will first resize the old background before it will switch a millisecond later to the other, i use it with http://nanotux.com/plugins/fullscreenr/index.html
[15:02:56] <Cherish> <djQuery> apologies for dissaperaing earlier...  We had a powercut..
[15:03:35] <BinaryKitten> JakeSays nothing but changes names lots
[15:04:15] <Cherish> <djQuery> dissapearing even...    I just noticed you sent me a snippet of code..   thanks.. I will have a quick look at it
[15:05:06] <ch3mical> Ok, this is retarded. I can't seem to make delegate work only on ul's and not bubble up to the li's in them
[15:05:16] <JakeSays> BinaryKitten: lol friggin' network was messing with me
[15:05:48] <JakeSays> Cherish: where are you located? (i think we had a power issue here as well)
[15:06:26] <Cherish> near Manchester in the UK.. you?
[15:06:39] <JakeSays> little west of there
[15:06:43] <JakeSays> utah, usa. lol
[15:06:47] <Cherish> haha..
[15:06:56] <ch3mical> Practically the same
[15:07:38] <Cherish> why is that also full of mindless idiots too with all these riots at the moment..
[15:07:40] <Cherish> ?
[15:08:24] <Cherish> nothing but silly little boys with nothing better to do..  take it you must have seen the news about it
[15:09:09] <TehShrike1> It sounds like angry people breaking things that aren't directly related to the things that are making them angry
[15:10:07] <chjj> TekShrikel: i think that is the definition of a riot
[15:11:00] <TehShrike1> No, a riot is angry people breaking things :-P
[15:11:08] <donburks> Yeah, it was fun here in Vancouver back in June...but we only rioted for a few hours. The Brits had to (ironically) pull a Dundee on us: "That's not a riot! THIS is a riot!"
[15:12:08] <Cherish> its literally kids who have no respect or discipline. No reasoning..  I think we have certain pockets of society which are unfortunately kids who are having kids of their own at a young age and have no morals...
[15:12:46] <zoned> i've noticed that the text input's "size" attribute appears to be a different size depending on which browser you're using... is there some sort of way to standardize or keep this consistent that anyone knows of??
[15:13:05] <zoned> that is, size=10 in chrome looks different than size=10 in firefox
[15:13:19] <donburks> zoned: Good luck. Wait til you get to IE.
[15:13:25] <chjj> yes, dont use @size
[15:13:28] <Cherish> believe me, we are not all like that and its very shameful and embarrassing for our country..
[15:13:32] <donburks> zoned: Use CSS for width of the input.
[15:13:48] <zoned> thanks guys :)
[15:13:52] <donburks> That way it's consistent.
[15:13:52] <Cherish> anyway.. is <djQuery> on still?
[15:14:14] <zoned> cherish, have you still not figured out your problem? sorry i had to run to a meeting
[15:14:48] <Cherish>  <djQuery> sent me  a snippet of code earlier but we have had a powercut..  so only just come back on
[15:14:57] <Cherish> but no.. not sorted yet.
[15:15:13] <BinaryKitten> djQuery  ping
[15:15:14] <zoned> cherish it seems to be such a simple problem....
[15:15:28] <Cherish> I know.. tell me about it.
[15:15:39] <zoned> you bind a click handler to your arrow, use a selector to get the description from whatever image, and set the html of the 'info' box.........
[15:15:59] <Cherish> yep
[15:16:03] <zoned> lol
[15:16:17] <zoned> so what's happening?
[15:16:28] <Cherish> have a look what i was sent .. http://jsbin.com/omusiw/2/edit
[15:17:23] <zoned> does that not work?
[15:17:26] <Cherish> that was what djQuery sent me before my problem earlier.    I just changed my code to that but now that seems to have broken my script.
[15:17:56] <zoned> do you understand what he's doing? admittedly it's the 'better' way, but slightly more confusing.
[15:18:50] <Iarfen> How can I make that a radio button appears equal that when I have the cursor inside it?
[15:19:06] <TehShrike|Work> hurr?
[15:19:14] <Cherish> <zoned>  could you have a look at the source to see if I have implementd correctly?   http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html
[15:19:39] <Cherish> for some reason its not loading the images up so somethings now broke somewhere..
[15:20:08] <zoned> cherish, you don't have the images array in a jquery $function() block
[15:20:37] <zoned> any time you write jquery, everything needs to be wrapped in a $function() { // other functions and stuff here
[15:21:27] <zoned> it seems to me like you're pretty good at javascript, but you maybe need to do a couple jquery tutorials or something??
[15:23:04] <JakeSays> Cherish: well, we're still silly little boys over here, just less.. energetic.
[15:24:17] <zoned> Cherish ^^
[15:24:26] <Cherish> <zoned>  deffo agree...   So could you look again and see if I have done right now... if I have it still doesnt seem to work
[15:25:00] <Cherish> I need to make the time for jquery ... just had a baby not too long ago so a little short on time at the mo..
[15:25:59] <zoned> Cherish, the second $function() should just be a regular function
[15:26:13] <zoned> and everything inside <script> should be inside the first $function(){
[15:27:41] <zoned> Cherish, do you know how to use firebug?
[15:27:51] <Cherish> <zoned> pretty much
[15:27:57] <zoned> did you fix it yet
[15:29:28] <zoned> Iarfen, a radio buttom appear equal? english please?
[15:29:39] <TehShrike|Work> zoned: what do you mean, "appear equal"
[15:29:43] <TehShrike|Work> Oh, hah
[15:29:45] * TehShrike|Work looks dumb
[15:29:50] * TehShrike|Work coughs
[15:29:51] <zoned> lol
[15:29:54] <TehShrike|Work> Hey, look over there
[15:30:24] <Iarfen> zoned: I need t hat the radio button looks likeI focus him
[15:30:54] <zoned> $('#buttonId').attr('checked','checked');
[15:31:10] <zoned> Iarfen^
[15:31:56] <Iarfen> zoned: I don't want to check it, I just want that it turns a little "blue", before checking
[15:31:58] <Cherish> <zoned> nearly ... still getting this though missing : after property id [Break On This Error] data-longdesc: value.longDescription});
[15:32:16] <Cherish> where should I be putting the semi col
[15:32:22] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: can you take a screenshot of this "focus" behavior?
[15:32:33] <zoned> Iarfen, you'll probably have to do it with css.
[15:32:49] <TehShrike|Work> Does he want a mouseover effect?
[15:33:08] <zoned> Cherish, $function();{ = $function(){
[15:33:10] <zoned> take the ; out
[15:33:28] <Iarfen> where I upload the screenshot?
[15:33:32] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: the internet
[15:33:48] <zoned> and i told you to make the second $function() just function(), no $ and  no }); to end it, just }
[15:33:51] <zoned> cherish^
[15:33:56] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: google "image dump" mebbe
[15:34:22] <joetoday> hello, i've got a fancybox pop up with a target = _blank link inside it that opens a target in a new tab, but also forces the original page onto the clicked link too.  Any ideas on how to make a link behave correctly within a fancybox popup?
[15:35:19] <Iarfen> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/19/screenshotkwk.png/
[15:35:38] <zoned> cherish: i usually don't spoon feed or completely fix someone's code for them if i can tell they don't at least understand how to fix it... but you've been on this channel for hours, so here: http://pastebin.com/29pU3cy0
[15:35:53] <Iarfen> the button who says "perfil pblico" is focused
[15:38:34] <zoned> Iarfen, how the hell do you make it do that?
[15:38:50] <zoned> is that what happens when you hover over it?
[15:39:13] <Iarfen> zoned: yes
[15:39:33] <zoned> Iarfen, I still think you should just do it in CSS
[15:39:42] <Iarfen> zoned: how??
[15:39:53] <Iarfen> I need that when selecting a div, the radio button appears focused
[15:42:00] <zoned> $('#theDiv').click(function(e) { $('#theBtn').attr('class','focused') });      then in your css, create a class called focused, and figure out how to change the color of a radio button. i've never done it, but i am sure it's possible. google "how to change color of radio button with css" and you should find some info?
[15:42:03] <zoned> Iarfen^
[15:42:42] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: that's a bad idea
[15:42:46] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: from the UI perspective
[15:42:48] <Cherish> <zoned> sorry ...  :(  really appreciate it ..  your code looked exaclty like mine but I just pasted it in and uploaded but firebug is still throwing up an error..
[15:42:58] <TehShrike|Work> Iarfen: There's a reason that non-hover, hover, and selected all look different
[15:43:54] <zoned> cherish, add <script type="text/javascript">
[15:44:14] <Iarfen> TehShrike|Work: yes I don't want to change the look
[15:49:28] <hiosilver> Is there any way to keep the first box checked in this example http://jsfiddle.net/uUmG7/ ?
[15:50:08] <hiosilver> The first checkbox is like a trigger, to check all of the other boxes, but when clicked it won't remain checked :/
[15:51:24] <Cherish> <zoned> nah that makes no difference.  still saying missing ; before statement [Break On This Error] $function(){   :(
[15:51:49] <Cherish> brain just isnt functioning.. :(
[15:54:12] <zoned> cherish: i am sure you have got a missing/extra ( ) { } ; ' " somewhere in your code
[15:54:20] <zoned> starting ripping stuff out, try again, etc.
[15:55:04] <zoned> or just study it, it might be obvious
[15:55:10] <zoned> it might not
[15:55:51] <zoned> i would start by removing the entire images array section, test it, see if you get a new error, if not, cut something else out, etc. isolate what chunk of code is causing the error, then find out why
[15:55:54] <zoned> cherish^
[15:56:14] <BinaryKitten> hiosilver  ... http://jsfiddle.net/uUmG7/1/
[15:57:00] <hiosilver> BinaryKitten: Wow
[15:57:12] <hiosilver> BinaryKitten: Thanks a lot! It was driving me crazy
[15:57:14] <BinaryKitten> you might also want to change that.. as well to this... http://jsfiddle.net/uUmG7/2/
[15:57:37] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/uUmG7/2/ makes it so that it doesn't search the dom every time the box changes
[15:57:58] <hiosilver> nice, that way it will be faster?
[15:58:14] <BinaryKitten> 2 searches instead of 1 and 1 every click..
[15:58:26] <BinaryKitten> click 6 times, = 7 searches
[15:58:32] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/uUmG7/2/ = always 2..
[15:58:43] <hiosilver> I see
[15:58:48] <BinaryKitten> depends on what you want though..
[15:58:48] <hiosilver> never had thought of that
[15:58:54] <hiosilver> that's perfect
[15:58:58] <BinaryKitten> if you're adding more later
[15:59:06] <BinaryKitten> then searching would be ok..
[15:59:20] <hiosilver> they will be added, but automatically
[15:59:24] <BinaryKitten> but the general rule is the less you search the dom the better
[15:59:47] <BinaryKitten> how will you be adding them automatically?
[16:00:02] <hiosilver> Through php loop
[16:00:31] <BinaryKitten> oh so not after load
[16:00:35] <BinaryKitten> then no worries then
[16:00:52] <hiosilver> exactly
[16:01:02] <BinaryKitten> another small tip
[16:01:06] <hiosilver> they load with the page, and then it checks for all items with .marcar
[16:01:13] <BinaryKitten> the 1 master checkbox, give it an ID rather than a class
[16:01:16] <hiosilver> so the second example should still work right?
[16:01:24] <BinaryKitten> yep 2nd will work
[16:01:35] <hiosilver> Oh, sure. It's only one, so it's ok for it to have and id!
[16:01:44] <BinaryKitten> precisely
[16:01:56] <BinaryKitten> and ID based searches are faster than class based
[16:02:30] <hiosilver> great :)
[16:02:38] <hiosilver> really kinf of you
[16:02:40] <hiosilver> *kind
[16:02:42] <BinaryKitten> in the end you might not see the difference, but when you get to large apps and more code, small tips like this can save you a lot
[16:02:54] <hiosilver> exactly
[16:03:04] <hiosilver> It's better to be neat at the beginning
[16:03:15] <BinaryKitten> actually i go the opposite..
[16:03:17] <BinaryKitten> get it working
[16:03:21] <BinaryKitten> then improve..
[16:03:39] <BinaryKitten> sometimes you don't have the time to get it 100% perfect off the bat
[16:03:57] <BinaryKitten> anyways.. time for bed
[16:06:12] <hiosilver> have a good sleep!
[16:08:54] <Cherish> <zoned> nah that makes no difference.  still saying theres a problem at 		$function(){
[16:09:08] <Cherish> cant see why its wrong
[16:09:17] <BinaryKitten> what is $function
[16:09:47] <BinaryKitten> $function does not exist unless you create it
[16:09:57] <BinaryKitten> do you mean $(function(){   ??
[16:10:53] <Cherish> <BinaryKitten> http://pastebin.com/29pU3cy0
[16:11:48] <BinaryKitten> so the original question stands
[16:11:51] <BinaryKitten> what is $function
[16:12:34] <BinaryKitten> in if $function is a function which is being called with ()  then the { after it is broken code
[16:12:58] <BinaryKitten> if, however, you are wishing to use document ready jquery methodology
[16:13:13] <BinaryKitten> then you need to change $function(){ to $(function(){
[16:13:37] <Mexican> Does anyone have any experience using Tipsy (tooltip), it messes up my div's and I don't know how to solve it
[16:15:19] <zoned> cherish, what binarykitten said^^
[16:15:28] <zoned> i am apparently dyslexic
[16:17:51] <Cherish> <zoned> ok so should it be $(function(){ instead then ?
[16:19:18] <aro> is there an IE hack to make animate() work in 8?
[16:19:27] <aro> when elements are positioned absolutely
[16:21:09] <owen`> Yoooo
[16:21:16] <The_Janitor> yoooooooooooooooo
[16:21:46] <owen`> best way to say if target is this, do this, otherwise do this?
[16:21:55] <owen`> i have: var targ = $(e.target);
[16:21:56] <owen`> 		if(e.target = $(this)) {
[16:21:56] <owen`> 			return true;
[16:21:56] <owen`> 		} else {
[16:22:02] <owen`> oops
[16:22:04] <aro> PASTEBIN
[16:22:18] <owen`> that's not what i have
[16:23:02] <BinaryKitten> owen` if ($(this).is(e.target))    or even if (this == e.target
[16:24:50] <zeropx_> does jquery have a clock option once a time has been pulled from server?
[16:25:06] <zeropx_> NM
[16:25:08] <zeropx_> never mind
[16:26:05] <owen`t> what was that again? mirc quit on me..
[16:27:57] <BinaryKitten> owen`t   if ($(this).is(e.target))    or even if (this == e.target
[16:28:26] <BinaryKitten> no need to wrap for that check
[16:29:39] <owen`t> BinaryKitten, when i apply that to a mousedown on the element it's giving me the else..
[16:29:58] <Cherish> <zoned> changed to $(function(){ but still hasnt resolved it http://pastebin.com/nTe6U56q
[16:30:00] <owen`t> i have else {console.log('other target')}
[16:30:05] <BinaryKitten> jsfiddle owen`t
[16:30:12] <owen`t> ok
[16:30:35] <BinaryKitten> also console.log("this", this); console.log('other',e.target)
[16:30:42] <BinaryKitten> you can then see what is what
[16:30:52] <Cherish> <BinaryKitten>changed to http://pastebin.com/nTe6U56q..  can you advise if it is still wrong?
[16:31:33] <BinaryKitten> ye[
[16:31:35] <BinaryKitten> yep
[16:31:52] <BinaryKitten> you aren't telling js where the end of the array is
[16:32:25] <BinaryKitten> also you have a function inside a function that is never called
[16:32:52] <BinaryKitten> also, do you need to use live?
[16:33:09] <BinaryKitten> (i think not in this case)
[16:33:16] <owen`t> BinaryKitten, it's because I have elements inside '.window' and the target is those, obviously.
[16:33:27] <BinaryKitten> also you can't use - in keys without quotes
[16:33:27] <owen`t> can i somehow say this and all children
[16:33:45] <Cherish> I believe so with part of the  script this is tied into..
[16:34:40] <BinaryKitten> Cherish also you are appendingto a elemen on every loop
[16:34:53] <BinaryKitten> which will cause the browser to redraw
[16:35:37] <Cherish> <BinaryKitten> this is just what was sent to me earlier by <zoned>
[16:36:06] <owen__> gd mirc keeps quitting
[16:36:10] <Cherish> <BinaryKitten> I really appreciate both of your help..
[16:36:32] <Jarred> Can I make jQuery's getJSON method synchronus?
[16:36:50] <coldhead> async: false in the settings object, Jarred
[16:36:57] <coldhead> but you better have a damn good reason
[16:37:09] <Jarred> coldhead To make you angry of course
[16:37:18] <owen__> i'm pretty stupid, i'm trying to put the click elsewhere than the window inside the window mousedown..
[16:37:43] <coldhead> oh i won't be angry, i'll just sadly close the browser and go outside
[16:37:46] <owen__> i dunno how that would work though :D
[16:38:37] <AdAlpha> Hello jquery folks, I got a reluctant div that drop down perfectly, but I'm struggling to make it coming back. http://jsfiddle.net/sxHKp/12/
[16:39:16] <AdAlpha> any help appreciated
[16:42:24] <owen__> AdAlpha, wheres the js for sliding it down in the first place
[16:42:37] <owen__> i only see animate top -17
[16:42:42] <owen__> -18*
[16:42:45] <danielt> can a pro please tell or direct me to some information
[16:42:50] <danielt> var Packs1 = parseInt(getIsagrafString("1.SorterStatistics[1].PacksReq"));
[16:42:56] <danielt> i want to do this but for a string
[16:43:58] <AdAlpha> owen__ it's this one yeah, that's the odd part..
[16:44:48] <BinaryKitten> Cherish http://pastebin.com/VtCZmzwf
[16:45:02] <AdAlpha> even w/ something like top:100, still. http://jsfiddle.net/sxHKp/16/
[16:46:06] <t`owen> hm
[16:46:13] <t`owen> i don't see how it's sliding down :D
[16:47:34] <BinaryKitten> cherish?
[16:47:47] <AdAlpha> same, strange is that It's a 6 line script. should be easy, but I'm stuck. condition maybe ?
[16:48:52] <t`owen> can you give me the link again
[16:49:19] <AdAlpha> sure, http://jsfiddle.net/sxHKp/17/
[16:51:20] <BinaryKitten> Cherish for you perusal .. http://pastebin.com/VtCZmzwf  i'm going to sleep
[16:52:04] <coldhead> sweet dreams BK!
[16:52:12] <t`owen> AdAlpha, your CSS seems a bit unnecessary. the absolute positioning
[16:52:16] <coldhead> happy riots!
[16:52:27] <t`owen> is it necessary to have the tab be absolute positioned?
[16:53:56] <Cherish> <BinaryKitten> Thanks... just pasted it in.. unfortunately it still seems broken
[16:54:25] <coldhead> BinaryKitten still expects you to do SOME of the work yourself
[16:54:31] <coldhead> she's just a guiding light
[16:54:35] <coldhead> you're the details person
[16:54:52] <AdAlpha> owen I've tried without, but can't get it work.
[16:55:01] <Cherish> could you suggest someone on here that may be able to relook over this ?
[16:55:27] <coldhead> Cherish: get your code into the best possible state you can and then ask your question and link it here
[16:55:33] <coldhead> interested parties will volunteer
[16:56:23] <coldhead> oh god you killed BK
[16:57:02] <Cherish> <coldhead>  BK has just posted me some code to try and sort a image var  to change some image descriptions on click. to get some image cursors to work
[16:57:18] <t`owen> AdAlpha: http://pastebin.com/aqnZwne2
[16:57:36] <t`owen> I hope that will work for your purpose
[16:57:38] <coldhead> ?csb @ Cherish
[16:57:39] <bot-t> Cherish, cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[16:58:01] <Cherish> <coldhead>  he posted this http://pastebin.com/VtCZmzwf but it didnt see, to work .. the images are now not loading into the thumbswrapper
[16:58:36] <Cherish> haha  nice gif
[16:59:16] <AdAlpha> t`owen thks a lot mate, clean, simple.
[16:59:26] <t`owen> YW, gl
[17:00:52] <coldhead> looks good to me, Cherish
[17:01:21] <coldhead> that was nice of BK
[17:01:41] <coldhead> do you have a link to an actual webpage Cherish ?
[17:01:49] <coldhead> otherwise we just have to imagine how it works
[17:01:55] <coldhead> and i imagine it works great
[17:02:02] <coldhead> can you set it up on jsfiddle?
[17:02:05] <coldhead> ?p @ Cherish
[17:02:06] <bot-t> Cherish, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:03:06] <Cherish> <COLDHEAD> yes  I will send you the one thats working at the mo... http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride,html
[17:03:13] <danielt> can a pro please tell or direct me to some information
[17:03:16] <danielt> var Packs1 = parseInt(getIsagrafString("1.SorterStatistics[1].PacksReq"));
[17:03:19] <danielt> i want to do this but for a string
[17:04:13] <Cherish> here is the one that <zoned> and <BinaryKitten> tried to resolve .  http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html
[17:04:15] <coldhead> danielt: i don't know what that does, for a string or otherwise >: |
[17:04:46] <danielt> getIsagrafString is for parsing data from a microcontroller
[17:04:53] <coldhead> i can't look at this at work, Cherish, people will think i'm getting married
[17:05:07] <danielt> but it throws a wobbly if the data isn't a int or float
[17:05:43] <coldhead> so like parseInt(getIsagrafString(parseInt(1.SorterStatistics[1].PacksReq))); ?
[17:05:51] <coldhead> man that is a beast of a statement
[17:05:54] * coldhead shudders
[17:06:16] <danielt> oh it's a hell of a project
[17:06:18] <Cherish> <coldhead> the idea is basically the description thats in #dressinfo needs to change when the cursor is clicked.. as at the moment the image changes but the info stays the same and doesnt change atpresent where at present it only does it when the thumbnail is clicked..
[17:06:21] <dabear> 1.SorterStatistics?
[17:06:25] <dabear> that's not valid?
[17:06:35] <danielt> for tracking packages on a conveyor belt through a factory
[17:07:33] <danielt> @dabear it's a valid data source
[17:07:44] <DerNalia> hey, been having problems getting jQuery to load. My Page: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/331982/Sandbox/comsat.html
[17:07:58] <danielt> it'll spit out the data in console.log
[17:08:06] <macabre> i have a contact form written in php, works fine, once the user has submitted their info i'd like a jquery pop up to appear to confirm, where would i place the jquery snippet?
[17:08:19] <dabear> danielt: huh. isn't it a js variable? those cannot start with a number
[17:08:34] <coldhead> Cherish: all i can tell you is that binarykitten's code looks very good, and you should fire up your debugger and see what it needs to get working
[17:08:34] <danielt> i just wanna know if there is something like parseInt for string like parseString (which obv doesnt work)
[17:08:42] <dabear> oh, wait, you had quotes
[17:08:48] <dabear> coldhead did not
[17:08:50] <coldhead> ?eval 1.toString
[17:08:50] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[17:08:53] <coldhead> ?eval 1.toString()
[17:08:54] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[17:08:56] <coldhead> lol
[17:09:10] <dabear> ?eval (1).toString()
[17:09:11] <bot-t> dabear: "1"
[17:09:33] <coldhead> zuh
[17:09:36] <danielt> @dabear no it's a get location
[17:09:42] <coldhead> good work, dabear
[17:11:02] <dabear> http://pastie.org/2342336
[17:11:05] <dabear> that oen yours?
[17:11:12] <dabear> one
[17:11:28] <danielt> yup
[17:11:48] <danielt> thats a pretty old version
[17:12:05] <dabear> had to google getIsagrafString :p
[17:12:11] <Taggnostr2> is there an effective way to use getJSON in combination with localStorage? i.e. making it use the localStorage if it pulled the data already otherwise get them from the server
[17:12:12] <coldhead> macabre: bind a submit event handler in a ready function
[17:12:17] <coldhead> ?submit @ macabre
[17:12:17] <bot-t> macabre, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[17:12:20] <danielt> unfortunately i can't get it live for the people of the internet
[17:12:21] <coldhead> ?ready @ macabre
[17:12:21] <bot-t> macabre, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:12:38] <DerNalia> hey, been having problems getting jQuery to load. My Page: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/331982/Sandbox/comsat.html
[17:13:26] <Cherish> <coldhead> this is where it seems to be breaking , [Break On This Error] });.appendTo(container);
[17:14:33] <coldhead> Cherish: that's the bit i didn't understand. try commenting that out and rewriting it
[17:14:45] <danielt> @DerNalia roll back to 1.4
[17:14:46] <coldhead> this will require you to understand what it's meant to do
[17:15:08] <DerNalia> @danielt, what's wrong with jQuery 1.6?
[17:15:28] <danielt> @DerNalia line 18 apparently
[17:15:41] <DerNalia> hmm
[17:15:52] <danielt> download firebug and check the console
[17:15:57] <danielt> the script loads but it has errors
[17:16:22] <DerNalia> yeah, yeah, I am using inspector on chrome. But I just always think the problem is with my code
[17:17:27] <danielt> try just going back to 1.61 the lastest realses aren't always stable
[17:17:36] <danielt> latest*
[17:17:38] <DerNalia> hmm
[17:23:05] <DerNalia> @danielt 1.6.1 has the same problem
[17:24:12] <danielt> hang i'll give you a hand in  a sec
[17:24:43] <macabre> coldhead: thanks, i look into those two
[17:25:18] <DerNalia> @danielt: excellent, 1.4.2 has the same problem
[17:29:50] <danielt> @Dernalia be with you in a sec
[17:30:20] <DerNalia> excellent
[17:31:30] <SIDU> coldhead: hi ~ you stay overnight ?
[17:33:12] <SIDU> <div id='x'><b>A</b><b>B</b></div>==>$('#x>b').click(function(){...})
[17:33:24] <SIDU> how do i find out which index is clicked ?
[17:33:33] <SIDU> $(this).parent().index(this);
[17:33:36] <SIDU> return -1
[17:33:40] <SIDU> seems wrong
[17:34:44] <coldhead> $(this).index()
[17:34:50] <coldhead> ?index @ SIDU
[17:34:51] <bot-t> SIDU, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[17:35:01] <coldhead> ignore that spurious summary
[17:35:43] <SIDU> coldhead: glad to see u again today :D
[17:36:03] <SIDU> coldhead: i copied code from above page, but always return -1
[17:36:20] <coldhead> that really shouldn't be >: |
[17:36:42] <coldhead> in the bad old days you could get the index with $(this).prevAll().length
[17:37:25] <SIDU> coldhead: cool that works
[17:37:38] <SIDU> coldhead: but why you said old days. it is going to die ?
[17:38:03] <SIDU> coldhead: could i still use it ?
[17:39:48] <coldhead> SIDU: index didn't used to work like that
[17:39:52] <coldhead> maybe you're in an old jQuery
[17:39:55] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/juQeR/2/
[17:40:08] <coldhead> you can see that index and prevAll both work there
[17:40:41] <SIDU> coldhead: well i download jq just 2 weeks ago, should be new
[17:41:05] <SIDU> anyhow works, so i do not care which is which .
[17:41:08] <coldhead> should work then
[17:41:13] <coldhead> oh well, onwards and upwards
[17:41:24] <bitwise_> hi, im trying to build jquery from github bc i need a fix that was recently commited. however when the script tries to minify itself i see a node error: Cannot read property 'reason' of null. any ideas on that
[17:41:36] <coldhead> i think red_square on twitter came up with prevAll().length if you want to shout out to him
[17:41:48] <SIDU> coldhead: ok. since i get the index. how to toggleClass of it's all brothers/sisters ?
[17:42:02] <coldhead> ?siblings @ SIDU
[17:42:02] <bot-t> SIDU, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[17:42:17] <coldhead> $(this).siblings().tooggleClass('rolf aids')
[17:42:24] <SIDU> ok ...
[17:43:01] <coldhead> you want to get into the habit of thinking jQuery will usually have an easy way to do whatever you need to do, element selection-wise
[17:43:34] <juso> If i wanted to do this how would I accomplish with jquery - Have a client set at a webpage and me remote trigger something for it to refresh the page.
[17:43:41] <SIDU> coldhead: yeah. jq can also train your brain for a better design of your code.
[17:43:54] <juso> s/client/browser
[17:45:11] <coldhead> juso: the page would need to poll the server via AJAX every so often
[17:45:28] <coldhead> you can't reliably push to browsers yet
[17:45:34] <coldhead> the browser has to "pull"
[17:45:46] <juso> coldhead, right.
[17:46:14] <juso> Do you mean poll for a variable response of "ok refresh now" ?
[17:46:24] <coldhead> yes
[17:46:37] <coldhead> you could just have it fetch a JSON status
[17:46:49] <coldhead> {refresh: false}
[17:46:51] <coldhead> {refresh: false}
[17:46:54] <coldhead> {refresh: true}
[17:47:25] <coldhead> and your code would be like if (data.refresh == true) {location = location;}
[17:47:27] <coldhead> or w/e
[17:47:37] <danielt> @Dernalia you still here?
[17:47:55] <juso> ok awesome - this monitor is hooked up to display in a clothing store, i wanted a way to update the page. this should work it looks like
[17:48:02] <juso> Or do you suggeat another option?
[17:48:14] <DerNalia> @danielt yes
[17:48:50] <danielt> sorry had to deal with supervisor
[17:48:55] <coldhead> its not a bad solution, juso
[17:48:57] <DerNalia> it's cool
[17:49:12] <danielt> ok so there is an error line 143 of your script could be causing the problem
[17:50:03] <juso> coldhead, awesome, thanks coldhead.
[17:50:12] <danielt> cs_players is undefined
[17:50:32] <DerNalia> it's defined on line 38
[17:51:41] <SIDU> coldhead: i did a very cool jq for the first time in my life: and it works
[17:51:58] <danielt> i'm just gonna chuck it into jsfiddle
[17:52:07] <SIDU> coldhead: however it looks long, please check it for me :
[17:52:14] <DerNalia> aight
[17:52:16] <SIDU> 		$(this).siblings().removeClass('On');		$(this).addClass('On');		$(this).parent().next().children().removeClass('On');		$(this).parent().next().children().eq($(this).prevAll().length).addClass('On');
[17:52:39] <DerNalia> jsfiddle is legit. But I have issues with moving things over to files, because jsfiddle is really good about how it instantiates js libs
[17:52:53] <SIDU> coldhead: this is my tab code :D
[17:53:05] <coldhead> that's okay, SIDU
[17:53:18] <SIDU> coldhead: glad you agree :D
[17:54:45] <danielt> yeah and your using a plugin i don't know
[17:55:43] <DerNalia> @danielt, but isn't the problem with jQuery or something in my code, just by looking at the errors
[17:56:59] <danielt> no i was wrong on the first guess
[17:57:07] <coldhead> SIDU: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/456963/
[17:57:10] <coldhead> slight refinements
[17:57:25] <danielt> the problem is that cs_players is not being passed to your initPlayerSelect function
[17:57:56] <danielt> fixing that should also fix the other error
[17:58:26] <DerNalia> it shouldn't need to… cause it's global?
[17:58:37] <DerNalia> all the cs_vars should be global =\
[17:58:38] <danielt> try putting it into $(document).ready(function () { and passing it directly to that function?
[17:58:50] <DerNalia> putting what into ready?
[17:59:24] <DerNalia> the whole thing? maybe?
[17:59:33] <danielt> so that the var is define once the page has loaded
[17:59:40] <DerNalia> oh
[18:00:16] <danielt> prehaps your defining cs_players before the raphel script has loaded
[18:00:47] <SIDU> coldhead: ok that's great. so you can do $(this).addClass('a').whatever().whatever2() ?
[18:01:32] <DerNalia> woah… what does unexpected end of input mean?
[18:02:09] <SIDU> coldhead: fantastic, i tested works just connect them in one line :D
[18:03:16] <danielt> it's a syntax error
[18:03:22] <DerNalia> balls
[18:03:27] <DerNalia> those are hard to find sometimes
[18:03:34] <SIDU> coldhead: now changed to:
[18:03:39] <SIDU> 		$(this).addClass('On').siblings().removeClass('On');
[18:03:41] <SIDU> 		$(this).parent().next().children().removeClass('On').eq($(this).prevAll().length).addClass('On');
[18:03:44] <SIDU> works as well.
[18:04:30] <SIDU> coldhead: but looks bizzare to me :)
[18:04:40] <coldhead> SIDU: yeah, chaining is a big deal in jQuery
[18:04:58] <coldhead> you have a couple of days of wondering then a few weird dreams then you won't be able to stop
[18:05:17] <coldhead> i guess that's the same for serial killers
[18:05:39] <SIDU> coldhead: feel like sitting in a spaceShipCar now
[18:06:01] <SIDU> powerful
[18:06:18] <beasty> evening
[18:06:26] <beasty> coldhead: do you ever sleep ?
[18:07:14] <coldhead> i was sleeping until 4 hours ago

[18:13:50] <beasty> belgium
[18:14:00] <coldhead> Lampoon: YOU ARE SO RUDE

[18:15:42] <beasty> coldhead: you're from the sydney area ?
[18:16:20] <coldhead> yes of course, beasty
[18:16:45] <coldhead> the rest of the country is wild beasts and mutants
[18:16:57] <beasty> haha
[18:16:59] <DerNalia> @danielt, thanks! now my problem is with Raphael
[18:17:13] <beasty> coldhead: do you know a 'rebecca mason' ?
[18:17:14] <beasty> :p
[18:18:04] <coldhead> i don't believe so
[18:18:07] <coldhead> i wish i did
[18:18:10] <coldhead> she sounds nice
[18:18:23] <coldhead> http://www.physiol.usyd.edu.au/~rebeccam/ her?
[18:19:33] <beasty> coldhead: http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/22764_289166816983_505091983_3540763_8334060_n.jpg
[18:23:27] <coldhead> YOW
[18:23:30] <coldhead> she seems much nicer
[18:23:49] <coldhead> but i bet she has contributed less to the treatment of cancer with vitamin D
[18:23:53] <coldhead> no offence
[18:24:02] <beasty> np
[18:24:13] <beasty> she's a ginger by nature btw :p
[18:24:21] <coldhead> how do you know her?
[18:24:51] <beasty> met her on irc years ago
[18:25:20] <beasty> en we kept contact
[18:25:46] <coldhead> ha
[18:25:51] <coldhead> actual women on IRC
[18:25:56] <coldhead> it's so unbelievable
[18:27:16] <austen> IRC is definitely NOT the place for straight guys to meet potential chicks... :)
[18:27:26] <beasty> sure it is
[18:27:31] <beasty> years ago
[18:27:44] <beasty> we had chatrooms on all the big site's for teens
[18:27:45] <austen> Aah, yes. Time travel. :)
[18:27:49] <beasty> lot's of girls there
[18:27:59] <coldhead> well it's all a heartbreaking tragedy in any case
[18:47:17] <jellosea> hey, it seems that jquery doesn't append a timestamp to the ajax call evne though i set cache: false
[18:48:27] <jellosea> does anyone know why this is?
[18:49:03] <danielt> @DerNalia no problem good luck with your project
[18:49:19] <chs> how apply jQuery.noConflict()
[18:51:14] <DerNalia> $j = jQuery.noConflict()
[19:15:24] <Zoidfarb> Does anyone know how to make it possible to move a draggable OUT of a sortable?
[19:15:45] <Zoidfarb> What I'm looking for is basically the opposite of the connectToSortable() option
[19:21:56] <asadpakistani> anyone here experienced with jqzoom?
[19:28:48] <bfred> any quick way to convert {a:'foo' , b:'bar'} into [ {a:'foo'} , {b:'bar'} ] ? I'm using this, currently: http://d.pr/rcqN
[19:29:16] <bfred> I'm doing this so I can sort it via Array.sort(fn)
[19:46:55] <jjb1231> What do you guys think is the best way to display a wide table on mobile devices using jquery mobile? I tried to find a horizontal scroll script but it doesn't look like there are any for jquery mobile.
[19:47:02] <jjb1231> Any input would be appreciated.
[19:47:28] <geekbuntu> jjb1231, what does the table look like in screen mode?
[19:48:48] <beasty> bah don't feel like working
[19:48:49] <beasty> nn
[19:48:58] <jjb1231> geekbuntu: What's screen mode?
[19:49:10] <geekbuntu> what would a person see in a regular web browser?
[19:50:58] <jjb1231> geekbuntu: It's pretty normal table but the number of columns can vary greatly depending on how the user has it set up (i.e. it can be very wide)
[19:52:16] <geekbuntu> jjb1231, depending on the situation, i would put a warning (mobile display device will be effected [because of your preferences])... the only other choice would be to have an abridged version for mobile devices
[19:53:02] <geekbuntu> jjb1231, one thing i do when i have to cram data into a tight space, is i go tot netflix and other accounts i have on my android... i look to see how they handle it
[19:53:23] <geekbuntu> theyve done the work - might as well learn from it
[19:53:33] <jjb1231> geekbuntu: Hum, that's a good idea, I'll look around and see what I can find. Thanks for your input!
[19:53:42] <geekbuntu> you're welcome
[20:07:38] <Dravekx> anyone home? :)
[20:11:27] <miketaylr> hardly
[20:11:36] <coldhead> shh
[20:13:06] <Dravekx> I have this design with faux columns, and I've decided to use jQuery for even height instead of images. I was wondering if this is the best way? http://jsfiddle.net/dravekx/rwqkk/2/
[20:14:42] <miketaylr> ?g ba equalize bottoms
[20:14:43] <bot-t1> miketaylr, jQuery equalizeBottoms - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-equalizebottoms/docs/
[20:14:48] <miketaylr> like that? ^
[20:15:16] <Dravekx> ahh. that looks easier :)
[20:15:22] <miketaylr> but yeah, what you have works
[20:15:47] <miketaylr> better link http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-equalizebottoms-plugin/
[20:15:50] <Dravekx> miketaylr, I need to subtract 1 from the right, how would I do that? I'm a noob. lol
[20:15:51] <jaggz> how do I make a small area at the side or top of a page which, when mouseover'ed, it expands outwards showing an area of .. stuff
[20:16:03] <AnthonyW> Hi guys, I've been searching everywhere and I can't seem to find a way to load Non-DOM HTML into jQuery and then execute a series of jQuery calls against the new loaded html
[20:16:55] <AnthonyW> Is there some way to do this? It'd be neat if I could create a new jQuery object that would then load specified HTML and then I would process against that... or maybe I'm thinking about this all wrong
[20:17:09] <solidus-river> how do you use a filter to select one attribute out of a bunch?
[20:17:14] <miketaylr> soooo like ajax?
[20:17:21] <solidus-river> eg, i'm trying to get one element out of this but i don think its doing what i think it is
[20:17:23] <miketaylr> Dravekx: what do you mean subtract 1?
[20:17:31] <solidus-river> var thread = $('li.thread', t.element).filter("[thread-id^='" + thread_id + "']");
[20:17:45] <AnthonyW> Yeah, actually. Exactly AJAX. I'm loading AJAX and I want to only process the resulting data.
[20:18:00] <Dravekx> miketaylr, the way I have it makes the heights even. I need #right to be 1px less on height.
[20:18:33] <miketaylr> AnthonyW: so you want to make a jquery object of the responseText?
[20:20:19] <Dravekx> or not. I think i can manage. :)
[20:20:29] <miketaylr> i think you can do get that from the jqXHR object in the success handler
[20:20:35] <miketaylr> cool Dravekx
[20:20:46] <Dravekx> miketaylr, thanks! :)
[20:21:17] <AnthonyW> miketaylr: I guess. Basically, I have a huge set of plugins and jQuery code that runs on document.ready. It all worked fine until I started loading with Ajax... now obviously my ajax loaded code isn't jQuery processed. I need to run my initial operations but only on the new code.
[20:21:33] <miketaylr> oh right
[20:21:40] <miketaylr> so like, event handlers aren't bound, etc
[20:21:57] <miketaylr> do you know about live()?
[20:22:00] <AnthonyW> yeah
[20:22:06] <AnthonyW> I'm using that where relevant
[20:22:18] <AnthonyW> but I'm making somewhat heavy use of  data-tags
[20:22:36] <AnthonyW> so like,    data-autocomplete="url_for_autocomplete_values"
[20:22:47] <miketaylr> ya
[20:22:47] <AnthonyW> I have a selector for data-autocomplete that sets all that up
[20:23:50] <miketaylr> iunno, if you've got some kind of init() fn, you could re-run that when your new AJAXy stuff comes in
[20:23:59] <miketaylr> where relevant
[20:24:33] <AnthonyW> yeah, the problem is that I'm using certain init function that can only be executed once.
[20:25:07] <miketaylr> function init2() {} !
[20:25:09] <miketaylr> lol
[20:25:29] <AnthonyW> haha- yeah
[20:25:32] <AnthonyW> that's what I'm arriving at
[20:25:48] <miketaylr> i gotta bail
[20:25:50] <miketaylr> good luck
[20:25:59] <AnthonyW> thanks for trying
[20:27:07] <coldhead> that guy hosts my website
[20:27:15] <coldhead> http://coldhead.miketaylr.com/
[20:27:29] <coldhead> he's a champ
[20:28:17] <AnthonyW> yeah, he seemed cool/nice/smart
[20:28:19] <AnthonyW> oh well
[20:29:53] <coldhead> i have his cell phone if you want to call him
[20:30:02] <coldhead> ?time miketaylr
[20:30:05] <bot-t1> coldhead, New York, NY - Time: 23:30 Thursday (EDT), Weather: Partly Cloudy, 23C / 74F
[20:30:17] <coldhead> nearly midnight, better to wake him in a few hours
[20:31:16] <AnthonyW> this just seems like such a fundamental feature
[20:31:22] <AnthonyW> I'm surprised there isn't an easy way of doing this
[20:32:37] <coldhead> i think jQuery is trying to stop you running code repeatedly
[20:32:40] <jaggz> if I set an explicit width on a floated element, how do I undo that and set it back to its normal calculated state?
[20:32:47] <coldhead> and to force you to run it explicitly when you need it
[20:33:04] <AnthonyW> well, I am trying to run it explicity... I know when I need to run it
[20:33:13] <AnthonyW> it would just be nice to run it on exactly the code I want to run it on
[20:33:14] <coldhead> .css('width', 'auto'), jaggz
[20:33:44] <coldhead> AnthonyW: if you load the code via ajax you can attach anything you need to it before you actually insert it in the DOM
[20:34:03] <coldhead> $(ajaxdata).click(function () {etc}).appendTo('#newstuff')
[20:34:03] <AnthonyW> coldhead: Can you elaborate?
[20:34:10] <jaggz> thanks
[20:34:14] <AnthonyW> hmm
[20:34:17] <coldhead> assuming your ajaxdata is html
[20:34:20] <coldhead> but something like that
[20:34:28] <coldhead> in your callback
[20:34:55] <AnthonyW> coldhead: the problem is that I have a few hundred lines of code that do things like    $("data-calendar").each(...)
[20:35:27] <AnthonyW> I suppose I can go through and update all those to do    $(ajaxdata, "data-calendar")...
[20:35:30] <AnthonyW> if that would even work
[20:35:37] <AnthonyW> but that's still pretty lame
[20:36:17] <coldhead> you should be able to do it all at the end of your callback
[20:36:18] <jaggz> shouldn't this expand this area <ul class="menu"> when I mouseover the UL area?  http://bdh.voyager.com/j.txt
[20:36:22] <coldhead> if you need to
[20:36:33] <coldhead> but i suppose it depends on the code
[20:36:38] <AnthonyW> it would kind of be cool to do something like     jQuery.SetDOM(ajaxdata);   call my usual init() function,    then call jQuery.SetDOM(document);
[20:36:45] <AnthonyW> if that makes sense
[20:37:09] <AnthonyW> that way all my usual selectors are relative to the current SetDOM() node
[20:37:16] <coldhead> yeah, it sounds like you might have a plugin brewing AnthonyW :)
[20:37:29] <coldhead> i often add a class "processed" to my elements
[20:37:56] <coldhead> then when i add new stuff i go $('whatever').not('.processed').doStuff().addClass('.processed')
[20:37:59] <AnthonyW> so you understand the issue and see value in the solution?
[20:38:15] <coldhead> i didn't look at any of your code
[20:38:18] <AnthonyW> yeah, your solution would work perfectly
[20:38:22] <AnthonyW> I think you get it
[20:38:30] <coldhead> i've seen similar problems
[20:38:33] <AnthonyW> because that's a solid solution, it's just obviously less than idea
[20:38:38] <AnthonyW> ideal*
[20:38:51] <coldhead> you just get into the habit of avoiding the predicament with experience i guess
[20:39:14] <AnthonyW> I'm admittedly relatively new
[20:39:24] <AnthonyW> I've used jQuery for fancy effects and what not for quite a whlie
[20:39:39] <AnthonyW> but as far as developing full web apps with Ajax and what not... I'm a newb
[20:39:58] <coldhead> the further you get into full web app stuff the more off the beaten path you are
[20:40:02] <coldhead> in jQuery
[20:40:13] <coldhead> lots of people move to Dojo or backbone for that
[20:40:16] <coldhead> which is sensible
[20:41:25] <bbrandon> jquery can do it just fine
[20:41:45] <AnthonyW> interesting...
[20:41:50] <AnthonyW> I was just looking at the code
[20:41:58] <AnthonyW> jQuery already has a rootjQuery variable internally
[20:42:22] <AnthonyW> and there's actually a line that does almost exactly what I would've expected my jQuery.SetDOM(node) to do
[20:42:27] <AnthonyW> rootjQuery = jQuery(document);
[20:42:38] <coldhead> jaggz: i don't think you can animate to 'auto'
[20:42:53] <AnthonyW> seems like if I could just set rootjQuery = jQuery(ajaxdata);     ... everything else might just work
[20:43:00] <jaggz> I set it to 300px too.. it's not doing anything...
[20:43:13] <coldhead> ?p @ jaggz
[20:43:13] <bot-t1> jaggz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:43:21] <coldhead> get it up at jsfiddle
[20:43:46] <coldhead> good luck with that, AnthonyW :)
[20:43:50] <jaggz> ooh, neat site.. figuring out how to use it :)
[20:43:52] <coldhead> that's voodoo to me
[20:44:09] <AnthonyW> bbrandon: what do you mean
[20:44:29] <coldhead> he's dissing dojo and backbone
[20:48:05] <bbrandon> AnthonyW: sorry, i was responding to coldhead
[20:49:00] <coldhead> aren't we all
[20:49:53] <coldhead> welcome back, Dossy
[20:49:56] <jaggz> dissing dojo and backbone??
[20:50:18] <Dossy> coldhead, thanks - darn irc proxy doesn't rate limit well enough :(
[20:50:33] <coldhead> jaggz: get back to work :)
[20:52:22] <jaggz> trying to.. making this into a test page
[20:53:27] <coldhead> excellent
[20:54:04] <jaggz> I can't seem to paste into jsfiddle
[20:54:23] <jaggz> maybe vimperator is interfering
[20:54:40] <jaggz> interferring..  .. my spelling has gotten bad -- what do I do about that?
[20:55:33] <coldhead> read more
[20:55:48] <wesbos> get lion, built in spell check
[20:56:43] <jaggz> http://jsfiddle.net/g6NQw/
[20:59:53] <jaggz> got it there.. hmm.. did I do it right?  just a small section of <div> and <ul> html code, picked jquery (although I'm not sure if it's in there)
[21:01:17] <wesbos> jaggz http://jsfiddle.net/g6NQw/2/
[21:01:57] <wesbos> had to cleanup your markup a little and close some function callls. Make sure when you open things that you close them again
[21:02:19] <coldhead> that's what she said
[21:02:24] <coldhead> lonchtime
[21:02:27] <wesbos> heyyyooooo
[21:02:34] <wesbos> http://jsfiddle.net/g6NQw/5/ this is better
[21:04:04] <jaggz> oh man.. I thought I checked that (working in vim)
[21:04:47] <jaggz> why stop() ?
[21:05:10] <wesbos> because if you over in and out quickly, the animation will trigger a bajillion times
[21:05:16] <wesbos> try it o http://jsfiddle.net/g6NQw/2/
[21:05:42] <jaggz> I also updated my markup to make it more representative of the ul layout .. (although I have no padding and stuff so it doesn't look proper anyway)
[21:05:50] <wesbos> .stop() jumps to the end of the animation if you prematurely hover in or out
[21:06:17] <jaggz> http://jsfiddle.net/g6NQw/10/
[21:06:34] <wesbos> you have the skills jaggz!
[21:06:42] <wesbos> lookin good
[21:06:55] * jaggz smiles at wesbos
[21:07:02] <jaggz> I need to learn how to encourage people like that.. how do you do that?
[21:07:37] <wesbos> look at code I wrote three years ago
[21:07:44] <wesbos> cry a little
[21:07:54] <wesbos> I'm going to bed though
[21:07:56] <wesbos> seee yaa guys

[21:27:22] <jaggz> It's okay to animate a child element (by class name) when I hover over the parent element right?   $('.subnavigation').hover(function(){     $('.menu').stop().animate({ width: '350px' }, 250);  ....
[21:27:36] <sk8ball> Anyone familiar w/ WOW Slider?
[21:27:38] <jaggz> it's a <div class=subnavigation><ul class=menu>

[21:28:21] <leecj2> Hello, is it possible to select an element that has multiple classes in a selector?
[21:28:21] <jaggz> trying to make it be the width of the black "Articles" text, and when you mouse-over the Articles, it expands the UL list of articles
[21:28:46] <leecj2> i.e. if one div class="a b c", and another has class="a c"
[21:29:00] <leecj2> can I match just the one that has the combo "a b"?
[21:30:24] <coldhead> $('.a.b:not(.c)')
[21:30:25] <sk8ball> i've been having a lot of problems with jquery plugins (admittedly a jquery/somewhat js newbie) conflicts... where trying to run multiple instances of the same plugin on the same page just doesnt work
[21:30:52] <sk8ball> is there any rules to keep in mind when doing this?
[21:30:58] <leecj2> coldhead: cheers, I'll give that a whack
[21:31:24] <coldhead> the rule is that plugin makers often won't expect you to use multiple instances :(
[21:31:33] <coldhead> complain or find better plugins
[21:57:57] <cedrichurst> hi all.. is there a way to do an HTTP PUT that preserves the format of a json object in data?

[22:04:42] <Thomas`-> Hey all.  From within an iframe context is it possible to find the closest div with class "i"? <div class="i"><iframe></iframe></div> <div class="i"><iframe></iframe></div>
[22:07:34] <zoidfarb> Does anyone know why the ID on my draggables disappears when they get added to a sortable using connectToSortable? Example here: http://craxz.com:5000/
[22:07:45] <AfroTurf> is there a better way i can get all the $("input").val() w/out doing .each()?
[22:08:12] <Cork> ?.serializeArray @ AfroTurf
[22:08:13] <bot-t1> AfroTurf, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[22:08:33] <AfroTurf> thanks
[22:13:48] <coldhead> are there any black people in #jQuery?
[22:14:11] <cedrichurst1> i'm mixed race, does that count?
[22:14:13] <bbrand0n> me too
[22:14:52] <coldhead> i have to check
[22:15:20] <jaggz> coldhead, you experiencing a style issue?
[22:15:43] <Thomas`-> is there any way to tell closest() to work from inside the iframe progressing up to the parent?
[22:18:39] <coldhead> i'm not sure what you mean Thomas`-
[22:18:42] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[22:19:28] <Cork> Thomas`-: $('', ifram window).cloases() should work
[22:19:35] <Cork> *iframe
[22:19:40] <coldhead> closest*
[22:19:45] <Cork> ouch...
[22:19:58] <coldhead> it's an obscure word
[22:20:05] <Cork> lol
[22:22:25] <Thomas`-> $(".the-parent-class", iframe window).closest() -- like this?
[22:22:51] <Cork> Thomas`-: no you need to grab the contentWindow
[22:23:28] <Cork> something like $('', $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow)
[22:23:55] <Cork> ugg no not window >'<
[22:24:14] <Cork> Thomas`-: it should be document, sorry $('', $('#iframe')[0].contentDocument)
[22:25:01] <Thomas`-> oh i see. should it be $('iframe') instead of $('#iframe')?
[22:25:21] <phoe6> $('#site-select').bind('changeData', function() -
[22:25:23] <tbranyen> iframes are my favorite element to hate
[22:25:30] <phoe6> is changeData supposedly jquery thing?
[22:25:36] <Cork> you shoud prob optimize it by doing somethig like var $ifDoc = $($('#iframe')[0].contentDocument); $ifDoc.find(''=
[22:25:44] <Cork> Thomas`-: ^
[22:26:18] <Cork> uh... * $ifDoc.find('');
[22:26:26] * Cork fumble finger...
[22:27:01] <Cork> phoe6: on a jquery ui element?
[22:27:03] <Cork> sortable?
[22:27:31] <phoe6> Cork: bind I can see it is a jquery method/function
[22:27:47] <Cork> phoe6: i meant what element are you using it on
[22:27:50] <phoe6> but I am trying to figure out, what 'changeData' could possibly be coming from
[22:27:59] <phoe6> yes, ui element.
[22:28:21] <Cork> phoe6: its a faked event, comming from the ui widget
[22:28:28] <Cork> _trigger('changeData')
[22:28:49] <phoe6> what would _trigger do?
[22:28:53] <Cork> phoe6: look at the docs for the element your using
[22:29:11] <phoe6> okay.
[22:29:19] <Cork> phoe6: its a widgetfactory internal function you can call from your widget (if your create one)
[22:29:34] <Cork> phoe6: it creates a event that bubbles out from the element
[22:29:52] <phoe6> okay.
[22:30:10] <Cork> and you catch them with .bind just like you do with normal native events
[22:30:20] <phoe6> hmm
[22:30:33] <phoe6> I am going to play with it to understand it bit better.
[22:30:44] <Cork> ?.trigger
[22:30:44] <bot-t1> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[22:31:07] <Cork> theres the jquery basic function
[22:31:32] <phoe6> Cork: thanks.
[22:39:32] <Thomas`-> Cork with $('', $('#iframe')[0].contentDocument) was this example to look for a div inside an iframe (from the parent) or inside the parent (from the iframe)?
[22:41:30] <Cork> Thomas`-: inside the iframes document from the parent document
[22:41:57] <Thomas`-> Cork, oh i actually need the reverse, sorry i might have explained it poorly
[22:42:10] <Cork> Thomas`-: then its even simpler :)
[22:42:51] <Cork> one sec i just need to test the code
[22:43:21] <Thomas`-> k
[22:44:28] <Cork> bah i don't have an iframe at hand
[22:44:48] <Cork> its window.parent.contentDocument or window.parent.document
[22:45:01] <Cork> i don't remember witch one is correct for iframes
[22:45:29] <Cork> so ex. $('', window.parent.contentDocument)
[22:46:35] <Cork> ah, its window.parent.document
[22:46:55] <Cork> Thomas`-: so the correct frace is $('', window.parent.document)
[22:48:47] <Thomas`-> thanks Cork.  any chance you know how to find the closest class to the iframe?
[22:49:17] <Cork> Thomas`-: thats tricky
[22:49:29] <Cork> do you have something to identify the iframe?
[22:49:48] <Thomas`-> maybe the src attribute
[22:49:57] <Cork> ugg..
[22:50:19] <Cork> well it can be done but...
[22:50:23] <Thomas`-> i can create another identifier tho
[22:50:36] <ndss56> Is it safer to generate HTML code on the server-side and return it the AJAX response function to insert the HTML OR generate HTML code in the AJAX response function to insert the HTML?
[22:50:36] <Cork> if you have an id that ya its simple
[22:51:05] <Cork> Thomas`-: basically when you reach from inside the iframe you run selectors from the document root
[22:51:30] <Cork> ndss56: no its not
[22:51:50] <Cork> ndss56: but depending on what you need to do it might be slower to generate it on the client side
[22:51:58] <Thomas`-> Cork, i know what you mean. thank you for the ideas. i will implement it now :)
[22:52:39] <raiun> how do i create elementB as the first child of elementA
[22:52:52] <ndss56> Cork: responding to a click which opens a drop down menu.
[22:52:52] <raiun> if elementA already has contents and i dont want to mess with that
[22:52:59] <Cork> ?.prepend @ raiun
[22:52:59] <bot-t1> raiun, .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[22:53:15] <raiun> ty
[22:53:38] <Cork> ndss56: then its about the same
[22:53:54] <Cork> ndss56: if your server can send json i would most likly generate the option element on the client side
[22:54:08] <Cork> if not, then i would prob send the <option> tag
[22:54:42] <ndss56> Cork: sorry i didnt follow the json and option tag comment...??
[22:57:03] <ndss56> Cork: i was just thinking of using $('foo').html($html for select box)....
[23:06:03] <austen> Having a strange IE issue: I have a select element with a default option 'selected="selected"'. If I change the selected option and refresh the page (which should reset it to its default since I'm not caching or setting anything yet), IE defaults the selected option to the last selected option regardless of which option has the selected attribute. IE does reset to the default if I hard-refresh the page.
[23:06:39] <austen> The other bizarre thing is that IE doesn't send the "onchange" event when it "sets" the select to the previous value...
[23:07:14] <austen> Does anyone have any experience with this? If not, can someone recommend someone at Microsoft who is responsible I can go and shoot?
[23:13:17] <austen> Also, annoyingly, IE is "resetting" the select element *AFTER* it runs all my script, so it seems I have *NO WAY* to force the onchange event and have my script run properly...
[23:13:49] <Cork> austen: after onchange??
[23:15:07] <Cork> austen: at least firefox does the same
[23:15:38] <Cork> if you reload a page where you have changed the selection value, other then the default, it will keep that selection
[23:15:58] <Cork> austen: but its farly simple to fix
[23:16:12] <austen> Cork: The order of loading and execution is as follows: HTML defined including the select, js object loaded, event handlers bound to onchange, msie check to force the onchange event, THEN IE "switches" the element and doesn't trigger the onchange event when it does...
[23:16:21] <psino> is it possible in jquery to convert a self-closed tag into an explicitly closed one? (e.g <object foo="bar"/> -> <object foo="bar"></object>)
[23:16:25] <Cork> just run $('select selector').change()
[23:17:02] <Cork> austen: when the selection from the last time onchange isn't triggered
[23:17:33] <austen> Cork: I am doing that. :) I then "alert" the status of the object state after that call, and it is after the alert that IE changes the select to a different option.
[23:17:35] <Cork> psino: dom don't have that notion so its not a problem
[23:17:51] <Cork> ?p @ austen
[23:17:51] <bot-t1> austen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:18:20] <Cork> austen: i've done that exact trick before, and it has at least worked in ie < 9
[23:18:39] <austen> Then it should work for me, I'm testing in 8...
[23:18:50] <austen> GAH. IE is so damn FRUSTRATING!!
[23:18:57] <Cork> it is
[23:19:13] <Cork> psino: what is it you need to do?
[23:21:34] <psino> I'm receiving malformed html from a service (an object-tag that is self-closed, but that is not allowed in html), and I would like to fix it clientside with jquery
[23:22:02] <Cork> psino: fixing it in jquery isn't meaning full
[23:23:34] <Cork> psino: jquery handles it as dom objects anyway, and you don't have tags then
[23:24:16] <psino> good point
[23:29:11] <Weasel1991> Hey, I have a really weird problem and I was hoping someone could help me out on this one...
[23:30:39] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[23:30:41] <Weasel1991> IE8 is seriously killing me here. I'm working on this application which seems to work perfectly in all browsers, even IE7. Just not in IE8. In IE8 I have to click my scrollbar for actions to take effect. Examples being: Animated gif (in order for it to actually animate I have to scroll, or click the scrollbar. As soons as I stop scrolling it stops animating.)
[23:31:05] <Weasel1991> A setTimeout, doesnt get called unless I click or scroll the scrollbar (or change tabs..?)
[23:31:12] <coldhead> woah
[23:31:20] <coldhead> have you tested on other IE8s?
[23:31:32] <Weasel1991> coldhead: Yes I have, exactly the same issues there.
[23:32:32] <coldhead> man that's harsh
[23:32:37] <Weasel1991> I know.
[23:32:42] <coldhead> i don't have IE handy to test
[23:32:50] <coldhead> but got a link?
[23:33:21] <Weasel1991> coldhead: I do, problem being it's "live" for a company so I can't actually let you log on I'm afraid...
[23:34:19] <Weasel1991> I know it's near impossible for you to help without it, I was just hoping someone in here had the same IE8 problems, with a solution or identification for the problem
[23:43:30] <WOverdijk> Sorry, browser crash.... phpVirtualBox is utter crap.
[23:46:26] <Weasel1991> So, how can I find out what it is that IE8 does on scroll?
[23:47:03] <Cork> Weasel1991: only way is to disect the page, and try to find what causes it
[23:47:19] <Cork> there isn't really any shortcuts
[23:48:45] <coldhead> alert("This page works best not in IE8")
[23:48:47] <coldhead> ?cc
[23:48:47] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:51:08] <Weasel1991> haha
[23:51:11] <Weasel1991> Well yeah
[23:51:13] <Weasel1991> Probably
[23:52:26] <Weasel1991> I have "profiled" the page with the awesome IE dev tools
[23:52:35] <Weasel1991> Maybe an export of this would help?
[23:52:47] <durre> hi! I have a popup which is opened with jquery on click. when it opens I attach a listener to close when someone clicks on $('html')... but I don't want it to close when the click is inside $('.popup'). how can I detect if the click was inside popup?
[23:54:00] <Weasel1991> durre: $(this).parent('.popup').length > 0 ?
[23:54:29] <Weasel1991> coldhead: http://pastie.org/private/evpacpbtokazmmlidkqnuq Don't you just love how fancy this looks :p
[23:54:40] <Cork> Weasel1991: just bind an event listner on the dialog and do event.stopPropagation()
[23:54:43] <durre> Weasel1991: what is weasel in this case? all I have (that I know of) is the event
[23:55:02] <durre> Weasel1991: sorry, what is THIS in this case, not weasel :)
[23:55:23] <Weasel1991> durre: I guess this would be the click event
[23:55:38] <Weasel1991> You bind the click event on some element
[23:55:40] <Weasel1991> right?
[23:55:43] <Cork> Weasel1991: this is the html element
[23:55:54] <Weasel1991> ah.
[23:55:56] <Cork> you have to grab the first argument to the event callback
[23:55:59] <Cork> its the event object
[23:56:19] <Cork> Weasel1991: but really, a simpler solution is to just block the event
[23:56:37] <Weasel1991> Yeah sorry I didn't know that
[23:56:40] <Weasel1991> My bad
[23:56:59] <Cork> $('.popup').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[23:59:33] <durre> Cork: yeah, that was the way I did it before and I can almost swear it worked. now someone has refactored my code so I dont understand it :)
