[00:12:41] <Nindustries> Hi, I'm trying to figure out why my first webapp's navigation isn't working out.. I'm using Cordova/jQuery Mobile/Handlebars. Clicking on a navigation item blanks the page out, but manually typing #register in the address bar works. Suggestions?  https://github.com/HazCod/Quackr/blob/master/js/index.js   live: d00med.net/cordova
[00:15:36] <Nindustries> If someone could solve this, I'd be forever gratefull
[00:15:46] <Nindustries> * help me solve this
[00:16:19] <Nindustries> I disabled jQuery mobile navigation in index.html; 	$.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; 			$.mobile.linkBindingEnabled = false;  			$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false;
[00:19:37] <Nindustries> I navigate using hashChange listening. I know the rendering works because the initial page is displayed. Only when a new page should be shown, it doesn't work. I don't have to refresh anything, do I?
[00:21:20] <indn1234> Does Jquery-mobile work with Phonegap?
[00:21:34] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[00:22:02] <Nindustries> indn1234: I found a bunch of tutorials with it, so I suppose it does. Phonegap itself doesnt work tough, the webapp is put online for the moment.
[00:22:03] <fRAiLtY-> Is it possible to watch for an event/function happening then do something after it?
[00:23:09] <indn1234> Nindustries: can you link me to the tutorials? What do you mean "the webapp is put online for the moment"?
[00:23:47] <Nindustries> indn1234: Well, phonegapp is supposed to be installed on a mobile device but I'm hosting it on a web server to fix this; https://github.com/d4kris/phonegap-tutorial
[00:38:33] <indn1234> Nindustries: I am actually talking about using Jquery-mobile and PhoneGap to create a mobile app, for Android iOS and WinPho8
[00:38:48] <Nindustries> good :)
[00:39:24] <indn1234> Nindustries: my question still stands, is this plausible?
[00:39:38] <Nindustries> Sure
[00:40:16] <indn1234> Nindustries: would you care to elaborate on that, my good Sir?
[00:41:35] <Nindustries> indn1234: I'm not really in the position to do that, I'm afraid. I'm just starting on my first webapp, and confusing the different libraries. I recommend you to look it up ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW0Trnx7Yjo
[00:56:51] <Nindustries> This is a good example https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-backbone-browserify
[01:10:42] <dutch_me_the_cod> Hello People !!
[01:10:58] <blackkbot> Hello Alien!!
[01:11:09] <dutch_me_the_cod> say whaaa ?
[01:14:54] <dutch_me_the_cod> Hey, just researching and wondering, if it is possible to have a web based document (.docx, .xls, etc) Editor with Jquery-HTML5 ? Like we upload a file through form and can Open/Edit on browser too ?
[01:31:19] <drupol> hello all
[01:31:46] <drupol> I'm looking for a way to use jQuery().data() with AJAX calls.
[01:31:56] <drupol> I'm mostly looking for examples
[01:33:29] <NETim> morning. Array question. I have i multidimensional array arr[region][row$i] = data. I can get the content of the region level, but if i try to use a nested $.each to get the row level, i just get the ID, any ideas?
[01:35:59] <Cork> NETim: please provide a jsfiddle with the code
[01:36:29] <NETim> will do
[01:38:47] <NETim> Cork, it seems i was short of coffee. putting the code into a fiddle, I may have found the solution
[01:38:51] <NETim> thanks though.
[01:39:00] <Cork> NETim: perfect
[01:39:19] <NETim> yup.
[01:45:15] <NETim> Cork, would this be a good place to get some underscore help?
[01:46:09] <Cork> => #documentcloud
[01:46:26] <NETim> Cheers, been looking for a channel for that.
[01:53:26] <jop008> Anyone a CDN for jquery mobile 1.3.2 I can find them on google CDN
[01:58:47] <jop008> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js found
[02:00:20] <Cork> jop008: that is jquery not jqm
[02:01:07] <Cork> jop008: if you don't explicitly need goods cdn http://code.jquery.com/mobile/
[02:01:39] <jop008> I have performance issues on my site http://www.happyaway.nl
[02:01:51] <jop008> so try to make it greased lightning
[02:02:36] <Cork> jop008: well the jquerys cdns are fast
[02:03:20] <PersonX> http://pastebin.com/4NBKAPFi If b.htm is an IFrame inside a.htm, then is there any way for jQuery to detect if the value inside the <title> element of b.htm changes anytime after being loaded inside the IFrame?
[02:03:26] <jop008> what's better google or jquery cdn?
[02:04:09] <Uhkis> google
[02:04:16] <jop008> okay
[02:04:26] <jop008> I will focus on that 1st
[02:07:02] <PersonX> http://pastebin.com/4NBKAPFi If b.htm is an IFrame inside a.htm, then is there any way for jQuery to detect if the value inside the <title> element of b.htm changes anytime after being loaded inside the IFrame?
[02:08:34] <Guest64540> I need some quick help.
[02:11:30] <Guest64540> http://jsfiddle.net/7o41o4gt/
[02:15:19] <jop008> when I change <script	src="./include/jQuery_mobile/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.js"></script>  this to this     <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script> my page is broken
[02:16:00] <jop008> I see 1.3.2 is not the mobile version
[02:16:22] <Woet> indeed
[02:16:40] <Cork> jop008: the first one is jquery mobile and the second is the core jquery lib
[02:16:44] <jop008> on this page https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide?csw=1#jquery-mobile 1.3.2 is not mentioned
[02:17:10] <jop008> so how to find that cdn file
[02:17:21] <Cork> jop008: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery-mobile
[02:17:56] <Cork> they don'tso google doesen't host that old jqm version
[02:18:05] <Cork> *so google doesen't host that old jqm version
[02:19:01] <jop008> is not here //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquerymobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile.min.js
[02:19:07] <Cork> like i said
[02:19:26] <Cork> if you need 1.3.2 use jquerys cdn
[02:20:10] <jop008> but how relaible is this if google stops hosting 1.3 versions?
[02:20:30] <Cork> google hosts the libraries they see want to
[02:20:32] <jop008> Okay and jquery is faster then on my own server?
[02:20:41] <Cork> its a cdn
[02:20:53] <jop008> meaning faster
[02:20:58] <Cork> so it depends on where your server are, and the user
[02:21:16] <Cork> but ya, generally cdns is meant to be closer then you are
[02:21:23] <Cork> and that means faster
[02:23:08] <jop008> is it bettr to have less include files?
[02:23:13] <Cork> yes
[02:23:24] <Cork> each file you include results in a separate round trip
[02:23:29] <jop008> so store them in 1 file helps maintenance will be harder
[02:23:45] <Cork> there are server scripts you can use to concat the scripts
[02:24:27] <Cork> meaning you have the files separate but run a preprocess script to merge them into the file used for production
[02:24:44] <Cork> many frameworks does this by default nowdays
[02:25:00] <jop008> and jquery is faster then MSDN?
[02:25:03] <jop008> CDN
[02:25:09] <Cork> uh
[02:25:19] <Cork> if you mean code.jquery.com it IS a cdn
[02:25:38] <Cork> maxcdn to be precise
[02:25:45] <Cork> http://www.maxcdn.com/
[02:25:57] <jop008> but 1 file is a disadvantage if you want to defer js files
[02:26:27] <Cork> well using a common cdn for something like jquery
[02:26:41] <Cork> helps by making it likely that the lib is in the browsers cache
[02:26:52] <Cork> so there the browser might not even use the network
[02:27:33] <dutch_me_the_cod> btw, you can also use Y-Slow Add-on for your browser, and it will let you know how slow or fast is your website, and the reasons for it. There are lots of reasons for a page to be slow
[02:28:01] <Cork> true
[02:34:15] <jop008> How to minimise a js file?
[02:34:43] <jop008> http://jscompress.com/
[02:34:51] <MacroMan> I'm capturing the mouseup event on the up/down arrows in a number input. Is there an easy way to determine if I click the up or down arrow?
[02:35:04] <MacroMan> e.which only tells me which mouse button I pressed
[02:35:20] <Cork> jop008: the are lots of tools on the web you can use
[02:35:39] <jop008> okay
[02:35:39] <Cork> jop008: that said, most of the time it is more efficient to just gzip the script instead
[02:35:58] <jop008> gzip or any zip format?
[02:35:59] <Cork> one difference is that you save some memory in the client if you minify
[02:36:03] <Cork> gzip
[02:36:09] <Cork> gzip is not zip
[02:36:16] <Cork> it is a stream compression standard
[02:36:33] <Cork> ?g gzip http
[02:36:35] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP compression - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression
[02:36:41] <jop008> Okay I will minimise
[02:38:04] <MACscr> two quick questions: I am emptying a div and then populated it each time i submit it. Any idea why it doesnt repopulate the correct way when i do it for the second time? http://jsfiddle.net/xy23rLky/3/
[02:38:15] <MacroMan> This is my simple code that I'm working from: http://jsfiddle.net/rzrb9bjh/
[02:38:25] <Cork> MacroMan: simplest is prob to bind an input event, and store the old value and compare it
[02:38:37] <MACscr> actually thats the only question i can think of right now. lol
[02:38:39] <MACscr> i know i had another
[02:38:55] <MACscr> oh yeah, why isnt my 2 second delay working either
[02:39:40] <MacroMan> Cork, That's what I was thinking, but sometimes there is an event value that tells you some things.
[02:40:35] <Cork> MACscr: item is a dom element
[02:40:47] <Cork> so you first append it wait 2 seconds then move it to the end of the parent
[02:40:57] <Cork> append doesn't clone elements
[02:41:26] <Cork> MacroMan: there isn't a special event for the buttons as far as i know
[02:41:26] <Xatenev> hey
[02:41:28] <Xatenev> One question
[02:41:29] <Xatenev> http://pastebin.com/enc3JEvG
[02:41:41] <Xatenev> Im trying to adjust the height of all my iframes dependent on their
[02:41:46] <Xatenev> content
[02:41:56] <Xatenev> I always get this error: "index.height is not a function"
[02:42:02] <Xatenev> But i dont see the error...?
[02:42:10] <Xatenev> anybody might help? :P
[02:42:13] <Cork> use $(this).height()
[02:42:18] <MACscr> Cork: im not trying to clone. im trying to create
[02:42:22] <Cork> secondly are the iframes from the same domain?
[02:42:35] <Xatenev> nope they are from same
[02:42:38] <Xatenev> otherwise it doesnt work i know :P
[02:42:44] <Cork> MACscr: you don't create dom elements of a dom element by append
[02:42:45] <Xatenev> so it hsud be fine
[02:42:49] <Cork> you append the element to the parent
[02:42:52] <MacroMan> Hmm. I've noticed the clientY property of the event object which shows where the box was clicked. As long as my input doesn't change height, I could determine from that.
[02:43:13] <Cork> MACscr: and an element can only have one parent, so when you append it the second time you move it
[02:43:15] <Xatenev> omg it worked halfway
[02:43:15] <Xatenev> xD
[02:43:28] <Xatenev> Cork: U got an explanation why it doesnt work with .index.height?
[02:43:55] <Cork> Xatenev: why would 1.height() give you the height of some dom element?
[02:44:03] <Cork> or 0.height() for that matter
[02:44:03] <Xatenev> oooooh
[02:44:08] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. I am writing a plugin http://jsfiddle.net/kehjaLoh/ when I click on a slot from the lower items, everything works fine, however with each click, the event is triggered multiple times. can anyone help out?
[02:44:08] <Xatenev> I thought i get the whole element
[02:44:09] <Xatenev> in index
[02:44:10] <Xatenev> :X
[02:44:12] <Xatenev> k thank you
[02:44:22] <Xatenev> ur my hero of the day xD
[02:45:09] <Xatenev> Just another question, its owrking halfway now
[02:45:17] <Xatenev> Its resizing the iframe, but the iframe is gone
[02:45:46] <Xatenev> iframe is still there
[02:45:50] <Xatenev> has a height of 600px in firebug
[02:45:55] <Xatenev> but i dont see anything on the page anymore
[02:46:05] <Cork> JustMozzy: you would have to dissect the script your self, but something is causing you to add the event listener to the elements over and over again
[02:46:30] <Cork> Xatenev: you never answered my second question
[02:46:39] <Cork> is the content of the iframe from the same domain as your page?
[02:46:53] <Xatenev> (11:42:39) Xatenev: nope they are from same :) i did
[02:46:56] <JustMozzy> Cork: hmm... thanks, I'll dig into it
[02:47:15] <Cork> ok
[02:47:26] <Cork> then add a console.log() for the height
[02:47:32] <Cork> and see what jquery finds
[02:47:43] <Cork> might be you run it too early
[02:47:51] <Cork> so the iframe haven't loaded or something like that
[02:47:54] <Xatenev> 21 1 and 600
[02:47:56] <Xatenev> thats okay
[02:48:09] <Xatenev> thats the right values
[02:49:46] <Xatenev> but the height of the content
[02:49:48] <Xatenev> is just 8 obviously
[02:49:52] <Xatenev> twice 8 and once 0
[02:50:00] <Xatenev> so it reduces the height to almost nothing :x
[02:50:22] <jop008> Not faster http://www.happyaway.nl with CDN hosting
[02:50:38] <jop008> Is it slow in your opinion?
[02:51:11] <jop008> Is it wise to zip the json data at the server and unzip it at client?
[02:51:16] <Xatenev> It takes 10 seconds for me
[02:51:18] <Xatenev> to load the page
[02:51:26] <jop008> that is slow imho
[02:51:30] <Cork> wow
[02:51:30] <Xatenev> yap :P
[02:51:34] <Cork> ya, definitely
[02:51:50] <jop008> So how can I optimize?
[02:52:23] <Xatenev> Ur loading jquery more than once
[02:52:50] <Cork> one of the scripts took more then a second for your server to send it
[02:53:00] <Xatenev> u have to optimize the thumb generation
[02:53:05] <Cork> say /index.php?-action=vw_listentry 1.12s
[02:53:09] <Xatenev> aswell as deleting the multiple jquery requests
[02:53:21] <Xatenev> GET 370404_thumb... 2,75s
[02:53:28] <Cork> /index.php?-action=get_session&var=userID&_=1410429114992 2.67s
[02:53:40] <Cork> so, ya you have to performance problems
[02:53:49] <Xatenev> thumb generation is the slowest for me
[02:53:58] <Xatenev> took 6 seconds for me to generate all those thumb images
[02:53:58] <CodeGosu> i type in debug console $.ajax({dataType:'blob',type:'GET',url:'hum3.md2'}).done(function(blob){alert(42);});
[02:53:58] <CodeGosu> i have file named hum3.md2, it is requested and recived, as i see in chrome network tab, but callback is never called
[02:53:58] <CodeGosu> what is wrong?
[02:54:14] <Cork> welll the scripts gets blocked for a long time
[02:54:22] <Cork> so sure
[02:54:35] <Cork> but it takes 2s+ before the content is shown
[02:54:40] <Cork> not to mention the thumbs
[02:54:56] <Xatenev> Cork U have an idea about my iframe problem? .p
[02:55:04] <Xatenev> seems like the content finding doesnt owrk :((
[02:55:10] <Cork> i would say that is ~2s to long for the longest one
[02:55:12] <MACscr> Cork: im completely lost, mind showing me what you are talking about? http://jsfiddle.net/xy23rLky/3/
[02:55:13] <Xatenev> i get 8 height 8 height and 0 height xd
[02:55:39] <Uhkis> jop008: every index.php request takes ~700ms, i think the optimization should be done on the php side
[02:55:57] <MACscr> nvm, i think i figured it out
[02:56:04] <Cork> MACscr: no cause i can't say what is causing it without dissecting the script
[02:56:07] <Cork> and i don't have time for that
[02:56:20] <Xatenev> the find("html") doesnt seem to owrk :(
[02:56:51] <Cork> Xatenev: the only thing i can guess at is that you run the script before the iframes has loaded
[02:57:01] <Cork> so there is no content in the iframe
[02:57:39] <Xatenev> i put it into $(document).ready
[02:57:45] <Xatenev> so it should work  ithink
[02:57:49] <jop008> The json data it self is like this  http://www.happyaway.nl/index.php?-action=vw_listentry
[02:57:50] <Cork> no
[02:58:00] <Cork> ready fires as soon as the initial page is parsed
[02:58:00] <jop008> It is fast generated
[02:58:06] <jop008> so backend is okay
[02:58:19] <Cork> that means it will fire before the iframes has even tried to fetch the content
[02:58:20] <Xatenev> oh
[02:58:25] <Xatenev> so what condition can i put
[02:58:30] <Cork> try with .load in stead
[02:58:37] <Xatenev> iframe.load or document.load ?
[02:58:57] <Uhkis> jop008: that took 1.5sec to load
[02:58:59] <Cork> $(window).load() or $(window).on('load')
[02:59:33] <Xatenev> doesnt seem to work
[02:59:36] <jop008> here in 0.3 seconds (Netehrland
[02:59:52] <Xatenev> http://pastebin.com/UfVUfnE6
[02:59:54] <Xatenev> my code ^^
[03:00:12] <jop008> So the most part is on the js site of my page
[03:01:29] <jop008> I don't like the formatting of the page in PHP bad design and testing will be much harder
[03:03:14] <Xatenev> holy crap, it cant be that hard to just resize an iframe xd
[03:03:41] <jop008> My header files are optimized for CDN and have min.js option Not needed js are defered
[03:04:54] <jop008> is the  parsing of json data slow?
[03:07:42] <jop008> is it a good way to zip json data and extract at client?
[03:09:55] <Cork> jop008: depends on the size of the json
[03:10:11] <Cork> jop008: the browser does the ungzip so you don't need to care client side
[03:10:17] <jop008> this size http://www.happyaway.nl/index.php?-action=vw_listentry
[03:10:20] <Cork> and no parsing is normally not costly
[03:10:28] <Cork> what costs is how you add the data to the page
[03:10:51] <Cork> jop008: no that isn't even close to big
[03:11:08] <Cork> though the server seams to take a long time to send the response
[03:11:10] <jop008> So my php generates json I gzip it and my ajax calls doesn't have to change?
[03:11:17] <Cork> ya
[03:11:28] <jop008> the response of ajax is not affected?
[03:11:30] <Cork> the browsers network stack will unpack it
[03:11:34] <Cork> no
[03:11:41] <jop008> in all browsers sounds great
[03:12:17] <Cork> well all desktop browsers and all smart phone browsers
[03:12:22] <Cork> not sure about feature phones
[03:12:44] <jop008> But you say it makes no sense since it is small data package
[03:12:58] <Cork> it might make sense
[03:13:05] <jop008> I can try
[03:13:21] <Cork> depends on if gziping it will reduce the number of packages needed to send the response
[03:15:54] <Snoopal> hey guys im using $('.ui-datepicker-next').on('click',function() {  after the first load it triggers once but then it doesn´t trigger anymore
[03:15:56] <Snoopal> any ideas?
[03:16:18] <Cork> Snoopal: most likely cause the element is replaced
[03:16:27] <Cork> try delegate the event handler to a parent
[03:16:50] <Snoopal> i also tried $('body').delegate('.ui-datepicker-next','click',function() {}); doesnt trigger at all :/
[03:16:58] <decx> read this http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[03:19:16] <jop008> No success gzip ��`�w����	E��=;�UPTA�mP���g�A� parsererror
[03:19:17] <jop008> Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token x
[03:19:18] <jop008>  url: ./index.php?-action=vw_listentry
[03:19:28] <jop008> So ajax is broken with gzip
[03:19:34] <Cork> you haven't set the gzip header
[03:19:48] <jop008> No I didn't
[03:19:57] <jop008> How to specify?
[03:20:06] <Cork> depends
[03:20:10] <jop008> in a meta tag you mean?
[03:20:12] <Cork> you can do it in the server config
[03:20:14] <Cork> no
[03:20:26] <Cork> you can do it with a header() command from php
[03:20:31] <Cork> it depends on how you want to do it
[03:20:42] <Cork> most webservers has built in support for gzip
[03:20:46] <jop008> Send gzip data to browser
[03:20:50] <Cork> and then they add the header automatically
[03:21:06] <jop008> now I have this at server site print gzcompress(json_encode($rows), 9);
[03:21:14] <Cork> ok so you do it in code
[03:21:20] <Cork> then you need to set the header manually
[03:21:29] <jop008> yes 1 line I can handle
[03:21:29] <Cork> header('Content-Encoding: gzip'); should work
[03:22:13] <MacroMan> quit
[03:22:56] <jop008> GET http://localhost:8080/rental/index.php?-action=vw_listentry net::ERR_CONTENT_DECODING_FAILED :-(
[03:23:10] <jop008> at the top of php file i added header('Content-Encoding: gzip');
[03:23:31] <Cork> i would prob with setting the server to do the gzip
[03:23:39] <Cork> *prob go with
[03:24:40] <jop008> I think this is better ob_start("ob_gzhandler"); at the start of the page
[03:27:15] <jop008> yes that did the trick Iit feels faster am I right? http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[03:30:59] <Fraz> hi
[03:31:10] <Fraz> is this a decent approach at oop with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/LauqcuL9/
[03:36:59] <Fraz> wait no its not:(
[03:41:47] <Fraz> can i use extend so vehicle contains what object contains but object stays as is?
[03:45:12] <Vasa> Fraz are you tryin to clone an object?
[03:45:37] <Vasa> if so then yes
[03:45:38] <Fraz> im trying to create some form of inheritance
[03:45:44] <jop008> Can you also gzip your css files?
[03:46:41] <Vasa> Fraz for instance you got an object vehicle but you wish to make a new object, car with the exact same properties/values, but when you edit car it doesnt change vehicle?
[03:47:42] <Fraz> i want vehicle to have addition properties and functions, and extension of object
[03:48:03] <Fraz> for example object doesnt have wheels
[03:48:07] <Fraz> but vehicle does
[03:48:32] <Vasa> what is the source object tho?
[03:48:41] <Vasa> what does vehicle extend
[03:48:50] <Fraz> var object
[03:49:23] <Vasa> well just do
[03:49:31] <Vasa> var vehicle = jQuery.extend(true, {}, object);
[03:49:45] <Vasa> it will clone object into vehicle, editing vehicle wont change object
[03:51:07] <Fraz> no, but for example jQuery.extend(true, {setWheels: function(w) {this.wheels = w;}}, object); << i can now call setWheels on an object
[03:52:24] <Vasa> are you saying that it affects the source object ?
[03:53:28] <Vasa> in my test it doesn't
[03:53:52] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/LauqcuL9/2/
[03:55:06] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/LauqcuL9/2/
[03:58:24] <Fraz> yeh it affects the source object, as you can see in that fiddle i can set and log the wheels of obj
[03:58:54] <Vasa_> http://pastebin.com/s3uxMPBh
[03:59:51] <Vasa_> Fraz you should do deep clone
[03:59:53] <Fraz> oh yeah but youre logging the original object. I want to create instances of them
[04:01:10] <Fraz> i am using a deep clone in my last fiddle
[04:02:11] <Nomikos> I love the out-of-context potential or irc messages
[04:02:25] <Nomikos> *of
[04:02:36] <Kingsy> is it possible using .get() to submit a form? rather than just pass a URL ?
[04:02:58] <Fraz> Vasa, <Fraz> oh yeah but youre logging the original object. I want to create instances of them
[04:12:04] <mukeshJq> how to validate youtube url using javascript
[04:12:22] <Woet> mukeshJq: what have you done yourself to get an answer?
[04:14:24] <mukeshJQ_> how to validate youtube website url
[04:14:33] <mukeshJQ_> i wish to insert url into my db
[04:14:47] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: what have you done yourself to get an answer?
[04:15:19] <mukeshJQ_> woet: ??
[04:15:30] <Woet> and please tell me you are 1) not solely relying on client-side validation and 2) not doing this to prevent MySQL injection
[04:15:34] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: it's a simple question
[04:15:43] <Woet> what have you done yourself to get an answer to your question
[04:15:51] <Nomikos> friendlier wording would have been "what have you tried so far?"
[04:15:55] <mukeshJQ_> client-side validation
[04:16:00] <Woet> Nomikos: ty
[04:16:17] <Nomikos> (or "less open to misinterpretation")
[04:16:50] <Nomikos> is it even possible I wonder? on the server side I'd check http headers for status
[04:17:11] <Woet> well you can't check whether it's an actual video
[04:17:17] <Woet> but you can validate the URL I suppose
[04:17:30] <mukeshJQ_> i m asing about url in text format
[04:17:36] <mukeshJQ_> when insert to db
[04:17:37] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: what have you tried so far?
[04:18:04] <sahbeewah> Fraz: That is the worst, please read up on prototypical oop
[04:18:07] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: do you also have server-side validation? you can't rely on client-side validation for anything more than UI
[04:18:21] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: and I assume this is just for basic validation, not for preventing SQL injection
[04:18:45] <mukeshJQ_> yes basic validation
[04:19:49] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: okay, have you tried Googling your question
[04:19:55] <Woet> e.g. "validate youtube url using javascript"
[04:20:30] <mukeshJQ_> woet: have auy idea for that
[04:20:46] <Woet> mukeshJQ_: any idea for what? using Google?
[04:21:14] <mukeshJQ_> woet:ok thanx
[04:59:37] <jop008> my page http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm throws errors at IE 8.06/7 On the console there is no error so where to begin?
[04:59:53] <Woet> it throws errors but there is no error
[04:59:55] <Woet> you confuse me
[05:00:56] <jop008> talking to me?
[05:01:02] <Woet> well yes
[05:01:14] <jop008> What is the confusion?
[05:01:33] <Woet> you said "throws errors"
[05:01:36] <Woet> and "there is no error"
[05:01:38] <Woet> in the same sentence.
[05:01:51] <jop008> in the way that the layout is not what is expected
[05:02:01] <jop008> So visual errors
[05:02:03] <Woet> okay
[05:02:14] <jop008> The page stops loading in the middle
[05:02:15] <Woet> so how is it related to jQuery if it's visual
[05:02:19] <jop008> or @beginneing
[05:02:38] <jop008> The page is not rendered as it should
[05:02:45] <jop008> looking in other browser
[05:03:20] <jop008> maybe jquery version issue i use 1.3.2 mobile and 1.9.1. core
[05:03:32] <jop008> is this IE8 compatible?
[05:04:26] <Woet> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/1.3/
[05:04:43] <jop008> it looks fine

[05:11:49] <rajlaksh> hi
[05:12:20] <rajlaksh> what is called no page refresh posting reply?
[05:12:31] <Woet> .. AJAX?
[05:12:47] <rajlaksh> ajax
[05:12:50] <rajlaksh> yeah
[05:13:12] <rajlaksh> i don't know Keyword
[05:16:07] <rajlaksh> Submit form without refreshing page ajax,php,javascript and retrive it
[05:16:22] <Woet> is that a question?
[05:16:33] <rajlaksh> Yeah
[05:16:54] <Woet> .. okay
[05:16:56] <Woet> what is the question?
[05:17:00] <Woet> "Submit form without refreshing page ajax,php,javascript and retrive it" is not a question
[05:17:04] <decx> copy your last line, enter into google -> success
[05:17:30] <decx> or rather... done() ^^
[05:18:12] <rajlaksh> I'm working on Social Networking script
[05:23:40] <bl4ckdu5t> I have this filter http://jsfiddle.net/wsfvtgng/1/
[05:24:00] <bl4ckdu5t> It works fine but there's one problem
[05:24:37] <bl4ckdu5t> If I filter female, and I'm to filter based on experience, It will general seek everyone with that experience
[05:25:00] <bl4ckdu5t> meanwhile it should at this point it should filter only females with that experience
[05:25:28] <bl4ckdu5t> I wrote this and I've been thinking of a way to implement it to retain filters that had been made
[05:25:54] <bl4ckdu5t> Because of this, I set a class 'filtered' to the filterers as soon as they are used
[05:26:12] <bl4ckdu5t> but I can't still figure out how to have them exactly as I need
[05:27:06] <Kuurde> I have a problem with autocomplete not shooting a select event on IE8. Known problem? Other browsers work. Version 1.10.2 of jQuery UI
[05:28:11] <Kuurde> Problem only occurs when selecting an item from the autocomplete with mouse click. By keyboard the select event is called
[05:30:41] <sahbeewah> bl4ckdu5t: you’re using a function that handles the event of a particular select element across multiple select elements
[05:33:11] <bl4ckdu5t> sahbeewah: I had it for various before and Cork suggested I made it that way
[05:33:40] <bl4ckdu5t> It looks better that way to me. I don't think that should affect anything
[05:34:00] <bl4ckdu5t> All the select elements have the class 'filter' and that's my selector
[05:34:57] <bl4ckdu5t> so in a way, after a change event on the select, I want it to check for all the ones with the class 'filtered' and obey their present values to give me filter results
[05:35:33] <sahbeewah> well… you can make it look as nice as you want, doesn’t change the fact that the logic is completely wrong
[05:36:53] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: build a list of filters from the select elements
[05:37:00] <Cork> (i told you this last time)
[05:37:13] <Cork> you need to refilter everything every time
[05:38:37] <bl4ckdu5t> I thought you said I should make one event call handle all
[05:38:48] <prohobo> god damn you frank
[05:38:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I'll try that now
[05:43:51] <sahbeewah> bl4ckdu5t: there’s nothing wrong with an event handler being shared across multiple event listeners, you just shouldn’t be applying logic inside of it that is specific to a single element/event (in your case, anyway)
[05:44:56] <bl4ckdu5t> sahbeewah: I've been beating myself on this for 2-3 days now. Please can you help me modify it for better
[05:46:09] <krambiorix> hi, i have a cloned div element , and i want to select all divs except the 1st level divs... How can i get them? $(contenthtml).find('div').find('div') looks a bit amateuristic i'd think?
[05:47:58] <helvetet> how can you make an easing call a function?
[05:48:12] <sahbeewah> bl4ckdu5t: um okay, give me a sec
[05:48:16] <helvetet> like it calls a function at every step
[05:48:26] <bl4ckdu5t> thanks

[06:03:41] <bob___> Hii everyone. I have a question to ask. I dont think its doable woth css only.  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Atliq the thing that i want is to put the green boxes in the white spaces.
[06:06:56] <rgman> bob___: Think it's a float issue. An element can't float above another one that's before in the HTML.
[06:11:22] <decx> somebody hasn't used the order property
[06:14:41] <litropy> Hi, all - how do I $( $(this)  > "span" ) again?
[06:15:19] <litropy> Ah, I suppose I could $(this).children('span')
[06:16:51] <rgman> decx: Good Lord... Thank's for the tip.
[06:17:12] <Cork> litropy: ya, children is the cleanest one
[06:17:22] <Cork> litropy: or you can do $(this).find('> span')
[06:18:20] <litropy> thx Cork

[06:32:57] <jop008> strange message
[06:34:21] <alienatu> hello, I have a small problem
[06:35:18] <alienatu> I have this function that works in firefox but does not work in chrome
[06:35:21] <alienatu> $(".scateg").bind("click", function(){
[06:35:21] <alienatu> 	var id = "."+$(this).text();
[06:35:21] <alienatu> 	alert(id);
[06:35:21] <alienatu> 	$(".box").hide();
[06:35:21] <alienatu> 	$(id).show();
[06:35:21] <alienatu> 	});
[06:35:30] <alienatu> here is the website
[06:36:49] <alienatu> bmm.f87‌.info
[06:43:08] <john-dev> alienatu: .scateg? which button is this?
[06:43:38] <alienatu> .scateg are the options in the select object
[06:44:49] <alienatu> which is right aboce the audio part of the portofolio
[06:45:06] <john-dev> try var id = "."+$(this).val();
[06:46:35] <john-dev> hm.. chrome show en error in your main.js here -> return $('.list').position().left; (line 18)
[06:46:42] <john-dev> show an error*
[06:48:04] <alienatu> the val() doesn't work
[06:49:22] <john-dev> yeah..
[06:49:24] <jop008> what is the right tag for js ? this <script type="application/javascript"> ?
[06:49:45] <john-dev> jop008: <script type=„text/javascript“>
[06:49:45] <jop008> or type="text/javascript
[06:50:13] <jop008> Okay I had problems in IE8 pointing to that direction
[06:50:14] <john-dev> alienatu: your main.js causes an error chrome doesnt like
[06:50:19] <alienatu> i the error in main.js but it still doesn't work
[06:50:22] <alienatu> *fixed
[06:52:16] <john-dev> give that .scateg class to your select and try this: alienatu: try this http://pastebin.com/dLGsqMgN
[06:52:52] <john-dev> ah, its option:selected not select
[06:55:35] <alienatu> it doesn't work
[06:55:41] <alienatu> not even in firefox
[06:58:14] <john-dev> http://jsfiddle.net/3kt4zvpu/
[06:58:23] <john-dev> this one is working in both browsers..
[07:01:38] <john-dev> you forgot to replace $(".scateg option:selected").bind("change", function(){ with $(".scateg").bind("change", function(){
[07:03:42] <BillCriswell> Also want to use .on instead of .bind more than likely.
[07:04:41] <alienatu> it works, thank you very much john-dev
[07:04:46] <john-dev> you are welcome
[07:04:54] <john-dev> using .on would require him to use jquery 1.9 and higher
[07:05:12] <john-dev> he is using 1.8.3
[07:08:03] <BillCriswell> john-dev: Ah, got in late.
[07:08:12] <john-dev> ;-)
[07:08:19] <BillCriswell> Oh, .on is for 1.7+
[07:08:31] <BillCriswell> So they can still use .on
[07:08:50] <john-dev> hm true, .live is no more working since 1.9.. whatever, bind is working ;)
[07:09:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah, .on is "recommended" though.
[07:09:57] <Cork> not really
[07:10:11] <Cork> it super seeds
[07:10:11] <john-dev> yepp
[07:10:21] <BillCriswell> The docs literally say that though.
[07:10:25] <john-dev> well, he is gone anyway
[07:10:42] <BillCriswell> Eh, "preferred".
[07:10:46] <BillCriswell> Not recommended.
[07:10:58] <Cork> ya
[07:11:43] <Cork> basically bind and delegate is tiny shims that the browser will remove when they jit the code
[07:11:59] <Cork> so it really doesn't matter if you use .on or .bind/delegate
[07:13:53] <BillCriswell> .bind and .delegate just call .on anyway.
[07:14:00] <BillCriswell> I love that we can argue about this shit.
[07:14:03] <BillCriswell> Well, not argue.
[07:14:10] <BillCriswell> You know what I mean though.
[07:14:41] <Cork> BillCriswell: well that is exactly what i just said so, i would say we are agreeing more then anything :)
[07:15:48] <BillCriswell> Well, it's still your fault somehow.
[07:16:59] <krambiorix> i clone a whole html page. I want to remove all hidden elements... It seems that in the clone, almost all elements are hidden which is not like that in the original... How can i solve this?
[07:43:05] <sanman_> hi, I wanted to know if jquery can prepend some html before each occurrence of a particular element/class ?
[07:43:15] <Jattenalle> sanman_, yes
[07:43:19] <sanman_> I don't want to prepend inside of something, I want to prepend before it
[07:43:32] <sanman_> would you know how I can do this?
[07:43:48] <Jattenalle> http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/
[07:44:10] <sanman_> thanks!
[07:44:22] <Jattenalle> $(the thing you want to insert).insertBefore(the selector);
[07:44:39] <jop008> Running IE8 trhrows this message   Unexpected call to method or property access.  jquery.js, line 5951 character 5 no call stack so how to find the cause?
[07:45:01] <Jattenalle> jop008, which version of jQ?
[07:45:03] <jop008> I have linenumber in the jquery file it is in append
[07:45:16] <jop008> JQ 191 + jQM 1.3.2
[07:45:32] <jop008> hosted by Google/jquery (CDN)
[07:45:36] <sanman_> hmm, it caused everything not to display :/
[07:45:47] <litropy> Can I select using a variable? e.g. $( 'p.' + myvar ).css( ... );
[07:45:56] <Jattenalle> litropy, yes
[07:45:59] <sanman_>   var $buttons = $(this).find(".hotbutton");
[07:46:00] <sanman_>   $buttons.each(function(i,button){$(this).insertBefore("<input/>").attr({type: 'checkbox', id: button.alt });});
[07:46:22] <BillCriswell> sanman_: You're making the same mistake I corrected for you last night.
[07:46:30] <sanman_> hhm, which one?
[07:46:36] <litropy> Jattenalle, just like I wrote it? I'm trying to select <p class="myvar">
[07:47:04] <Jattenalle> litropy, oh, $('.myvar')
[07:47:23] <Jattenalle> if it's an actual variable holding a classname you'd just do: $('.'+myvar)
[07:47:26] <jop008> it is this iste http://www.happyaway.nl in IE8 IE9 10 and 11 runs fine
[07:47:56] <litropy> Jattenalle, thx it's the latter. so $(p+'.'+myvar) right?
[07:47:57] <BillCriswell> sanman_: http://jsbin.com/wicurapijofu/2/edit?html,js,output
[07:48:20] <Jattenalle> litropy, $('p.'+myvar) yeah
[07:48:34] <litropy> Jattenalle, thx
[07:49:12] <BillCriswell> Damn autorun.
[07:50:13] <BillCriswell> sanman_: http://jsbin.com/wicurapijofu/3/edit?html,js,output with insertBefore instead.
[08:01:04] <jop008> the issue I have is on the same line 5951
[08:01:35] <jop008> but no iframes
[08:01:40] <jop008> in my code
[08:03:47] <qdk> Im using jquery 2.1.1 and UI 1.11.1 I have a zdiv clas="ui-selectable"> with a lot of <div class="ui-selectee">. When I drag-select several <div> objects in one direction the ui-selected class sticks to the selected <div>s, but making the same select starting in the other direction makes the <div>s lose/drop the ui-selected event though the selected event triggers correctly... ANY input to what __I__ could be doing wrong?
[08:04:56] <qdk> As far as I can tell, is totally out of my hands and the problem seems very likely within the jquery selectable function itself.
[08:08:32] <brollypop> hm im using var category = $('#search-category').val();  where search-category is my select, but whatever i choose in select it always returns value of first option
[08:08:39] <brollypop> any ideas what i could be doing wrong ?
[08:09:47] <decx> you get the val at pageload
[08:09:53] <decx> get it on change
[08:10:06] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:10:28] <DGDeveloper> test
[08:10:57] <igcewieling1> Not sure where to ask, but thought someone here might know where to ask.   I'm getting this message "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/octet-stream"   in the browser debug.
[08:11:16] <igcewieling1> I'm pretty sure it isn't an html or jquery issue, but no idea where to even look
[08:11:21] <qdk> hmmm, think I found the problem... Something seems to be removing all selection afterwards.
[08:24:48] <Kartagis> hi

[08:36:59] <fission6> I have the return object from an ajax call, is there a way to get access to the json structure returned, i see responsetext but i want the json form which is passed to my done() handler
[08:37:56] <Nomikos> fission6: pastebin/jsfiddle? most likely you should either specify 'json' as the return type in the ajax call, or set application/json header on the server side
[08:38:33] <decx> Kartagis http://jsfiddle.net/decx/r3j4yrrw/3/

[08:39:12] <Nomikos> right
[08:39:54] <Nomikos> fission6: can you pastebin the code? maybe that'll help clarify
[08:39:55] <fission6> so you need code for that?
[08:40:32] <Nomikos> fission6: otherwise I'd have to just guess at a lot of things, seeing what you have now saves a lot of questions
[08:40:54] <Nomikos> just the relevant parts of course
[08:41:55] <fission6> i mean i am getting a jqXHR object, i am just asking how to get the responseJSON
[08:42:45] <Nomikos> hrm, I mostly use the shortcuts .get/.post, where the json part ends up as argument in the callback
[08:43:44] <Nomikos> "The parsed JSON object is made available through the responseJSON property of the jqXHR object"
[08:43:49] <Kartagis> decx: what does parseInt(f.val() || 0) do?
[08:44:15] <decx> parseInt makes it a number and || 0 sets it to 0 if it's empty
[08:44:24] <Nomikos> fission6: that's from http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/, under data types. does that help?
[08:44:54] <Nomikos> Kartagis: the || 0 part is in case f.val() returns undefined
[08:45:02] <Nomikos> or anything falsy, I guess
[08:45:20] <Kartagis> decx: so, parseInt is equivalent to .toInteger()
[08:45:25] <Kartagis> okay, got it
[08:45:34] <DGDeveloper> part #jquery
[08:46:05] <decx> could be done smarter to default all nonnumbers to 0 too but i'm hungry so there's that
[08:46:19] <fission6> Nomikos: it should help but for whatever reason i don't see that property on my jqXHR object
[08:47:17] <Nomikos> fission6: are you specifying dataType: 'json' in your request object?
[08:48:21] <krambiorix> when i put my selected option in my html page like <select class="foo"> <option selected="selected"></..... -> $('select.foo option:selected').val()   -> val is always empty... What can i do?
[08:49:05] <fission6> yes Nomikos
[08:49:09] <fission6> this is 1.9 btw
[08:50:10] <Nomikos> fission6: could be invalid JSON, are there any errors on the console?
[08:50:20] <decx> <option selected="selected"> i dont see any value here so val empty seems about right krambiorix
[08:50:29] <fission6> seems to pass to my done() method fine as a js object
[08:50:35] <Kartagis> jquery doesn't have decimal?
[08:50:52] <Kartagis> something like parseDec() ?
[08:51:22] <Nomikos> parseInt(), specify base 10 as second parameter
[08:51:33] <qdk> How do you make sure a ui-selection in an element doesnt randomly fires a click event too? (after the selection is done and mousebutton is released)
[08:52:08] <fission6> ah its 1.8 Nomikos
[08:52:14] <fission6> haha
[08:52:15] <fission6> damn it
[08:53:08] <krambiorix> decx, ow i'm sorry, paste is wrong, there is a value
[08:57:24] <decx> well then you do something wrogn somewhere else
[08:57:50] <Kartagis> Nomikos: you mean radix, right?
[08:59:00] <Tumulte> Hello !
[08:59:09] <Tumulte> is there a way to use css() with em ?
[08:59:27] <Nomikos> Kartagis: yeah, that thing
[08:59:51] <Nomikos>  Tumulte I think it's {fontStyle: 'italic'}
[09:00:17] <Nomikos> basically use the CSS equivalent of <em>
[09:00:39] <fission6> what are you guys using these days backbone, angular, something else?
[09:01:11] <Tumulte> Nomikos: wut ?
[09:01:32] <Tumulte> em the measurement unit
[09:01:36] <Tumulte> not italic
[09:01:38] <Nomikos> Tumulte: I must have misunderstood your question, can you elabo.. ah. yes
[09:01:39] <Nomikos> right
[09:02:07] <Nomikos> I should stick to backend :-p like {width: "3em"} ?
[09:02:14] <Tumulte> cause css('top', '2em') gives -> style="top:2px"
[09:02:26] <Nomikos> huh
[09:02:38] <Tumulte> yeah. I thought so too
[09:03:19] <fission6> Nomikos: are you using angular or backbone or something else
[09:04:12] <Nomikos> fission6: I'm a backend guy really, so.. no
[09:05:07] <fission6> yea, me too, the front end is currently showing about 4 different views and its a spagetthi mess of jquery
[09:05:09] <Nomikos> Tumulte: when I use it for marginLeft it does make a difference. maybe 'top' isn't working the way you expect it to?
[09:05:15] <fission6> looking for advice to bring some structure to it
[09:07:38] <Nomikos> I know shit about front-end structure >.<
[09:11:04] <NETim> morning anyone used jQuery tablesorter?
[09:11:27] <NETim> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/?
[09:19:14] <Kartagis> what's the event for when we use jquery datepicker on a field?
[09:19:29] <Kartagis> .change() didn't work
[09:20:37] <decx> it's change
[09:21:41] <Kartagis> od.add(cd).change(function() {
[09:21:41] <Kartagis>           nod.val = diff/1000/60/60/24,
[09:21:41] <Kartagis>         })
[09:22:01] <Kartagis> I probably did something wrong
[09:22:26] <decx> i have no idea what's going on there
[09:23:07] <Kartagis> decx: I have two date fields, and I want the difference in days in another field
[09:23:13] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jw0e00m1/
[09:32:20] <jop008> Any hellp on this error in IE8 http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-09-11_at_18.30.57-qRWYo5hg.png
[09:32:49] <jop008> Hard to find a hook to start debugging all other browsers are okay
[09:35:15] <NoiseEee> jop008: perhaps you're using a library that is non ie-8 compat?
[09:41:28] <jop008> okay but how to find that library
[09:41:39] <jop008> 1.91 jquery and mobile 1.3.2
[09:41:52] <jop008> must be working in IE
[09:42:02] <NoiseEee> those are the only two libraries you are using?
[09:42:13] <drej> we miss you NoiseEee
[09:42:30] <jop008> No I am using more libs
[09:42:33] <NoiseEee> drej: ah shit i always forget
[09:42:58] <NoiseEee> jop008: then you should look at those other libs and their requirements
[09:43:57] <jop008> this is my header http://pastebin.com/MxMDvand
[09:44:14] <NoiseEee> jop008: so look up the documentation to all those libraries
[09:44:56] <jop008> Yes yes
[09:51:16] <davygshotme> So, I'm using the Thumbnail Grid from Typmanus and extened it to include videos on wordpress. My issue is when the video goes into full screen and exits, the jquery acts funky (wont open the next video clicked) and the images get pushed. http://davygomez.com/film/
[09:54:46] <davygshotme> any help would be appreciated
[09:58:22] <jop008> a lot of hist on the error SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.
[10:00:26] <Distorzion> Why this doesn't working? $(".menu").bind('click','test'); and define the function later
[10:02:55] <jop008> On the console there is a Call stack but that stays empty
[10:04:36] <NoiseEee> Distorzion: you don't get to define the function later.
[10:06:11] <Distorzion> So i've to define the function in the scope? I know it's better, just curious for learning
[10:06:44] <NoiseEee> well the scope is up to you really
[10:06:53] <NoiseEee> but you do have to define it in the handler, yes
[10:08:52] <Distorzion> So, the only way around it would be $(".menu").bind('click', function(){ foo(); });  ?
[10:09:04] <wodim> or put the function before the bind call
[10:10:09] <blackkbot> var closed = (function(){var closurevar= "closed",count = 0;return function(){console.log(closurevar);return count++;};}())
[10:12:09] <Distorzion> I see, thanks
[10:17:07] <Distorzion> Another begginer question, I've problems understanding how I would call specific elements of  a class. For example $(".menu li").bind('click','test'); would call all li elements of menu
[10:18:02] <Distorzion> even the nested ones, anyway to don't do it? and anyway to call only nested elements?
[10:18:15] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: .menu > li instead.
[10:18:41] <BillCriswell> The > means to only select the children and not any descendent.
[10:20:10] <jop008> I am getting further I know the error line fillin_title("Zoeken happyAway.nl"); an own made function
[10:23:12] <Distorzion> Ok, for example $(".menu ul > li").bind('click','test');  and $(".menu > ul > li").bind('click','test'); both calls all li nested on ul
[10:24:12] <Distorzion> what would be the difference between those and how would I call li nested only in the first ul
[10:24:52] <BillCriswell> .menu ul > li would select all nested lis still. .menu > ul > li would only get the first level of lis.
[10:26:18] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: http://jsbin.com/mojazudapore/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:26:24] <Distorzion> .menu > ul > li calls the second level lis too
[10:27:40] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: Your Then ou must be doing like <li><div class="menu"><ul><li>...</li></ul></div></li>
[10:28:19] <Distorzion> don't, for example in http://jsbin.com/mojazudapore/1/edit?html,js,output if you delete the first sentence, all lis become blue
[10:28:37] <BillCriswell> The firest sentence?
[10:28:39] <BillCriswell> first*
[10:29:11] <decx> maybe get more familiar with the intricacies of selectors
[10:29:28] <decx> .menu ul applies to .menu>ul as well as .menu>ul ul
[10:29:44] <Distorzion> decx, thats what i'm trying
[10:30:07] <decx> maybe i dont get the problem here
[10:30:16] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/mojazudapore/1/edit?html,js,output should they all be blue?
[10:30:29] <BillCriswell> decx: ^^
[10:30:41] <BillCriswell> OH DUH
[10:30:44] <BillCriswell> I'm an idiot.
[10:30:51] <decx> so what's new?
[10:31:00] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: The color is inherited, it's not actually selecting the second level lis.
[10:31:24] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[10:31:47] <Distorzion> Ohhhh, I got, $('.menu > ul > li').css('color', 'blue'); would select all li below ul, even those after another ul right decx?
[10:31:57] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: http://jsbin.com/mojazudapore/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:32:17] <decx> no
[10:32:27] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: No, CSS is reponsible for the second level lis being blue, not the selector.
[10:32:56] <decx> i guess that can be confusing
[10:32:57] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: The link I just posted should clear it up.
[10:33:06] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, totally slipped my mind for second.
[10:33:22] <decx> dont worry, nobody understand inherit
[10:33:27] <BillCriswell> Forgot that CSS cascades somehow after 12 years.
[10:36:45] <Distorzion> then, why would this happen? http://distorzion.com/u3.html , $(".menu > ul > li").bind('mouseover', function(){}); call all lis
[10:37:15] <BillCriswell> Distorzion: Because you're still hovering over the li since they're nested.
[10:38:43] <Distorzion> BillCriswell, u.u you're right sorry never tryed to see what was triggering
[10:38:46] <Distorzion> thanks
[10:38:54] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:44:30] <davygshotme> So I narrowed it down to be an issue with chrome
[10:55:50] <Xtreme> hey guys. How to detect onbeforeunload on iframe?
[10:55:59] <Xtreme> none of the solutions work for chrome which are available on net
[11:00:09] <alinou> any idea guys how could i get http://i.imgur.com/Xrtg47Q.png the text premium or standard in jquery ui picker
[11:00:17] <alinou> any idea guys how could i get http://i.imgur.com/Xrtg47Q.png the text premium or standard in jquery ui date picker
[11:02:45] <gurke_> hi@all
[11:04:53] <BillCriswell> alinou: I'd check to see if there's a method that's called after it pops up and maybe look through the date picker html.
[11:05:47] <alinou> BillCriswell, here is http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ api i couldnt find any method here
[11:07:49] <BillCriswell> alinou: Hmm
[11:08:04] <sanman_> how can I use jquery to find an image inside of a div having a certain class?
[11:08:07] <decx> you can set a daterange and then use css content to sneak text in there
[11:08:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha just looking at that.
[11:08:48] <alinou> decx, before or after
[11:08:52] <decx> no idea if you can set multiple date ranges though
[11:09:06] <decx> and from that screenshot it looks more like specific dates and not a linear range
[11:09:47] <alinou> decx, yes it is like this
[11:10:14] <decx> i dont think datepicker can do that out of the box then even with css hacks
[11:10:28] <decx> gotta extend it or use an actual calendar script
[11:10:47] <BillCriswell> [data-month=3][data-day=23][data-year=2014]:before { content: "PREMIUM"; } can work... but seems pretty wild haha
[11:11:16] <decx> yeah that looks like something you could hack in there in a <style>
[11:12:09] <alinou> decx, BillCriswell okay thank you
[11:12:59] <BillCriswell> Oh weird there's no data-day on there, just month and year.
[11:20:41] <litropy> How do I get all xml, including tags?
[11:20:53] <sanman_> can the string for an id on an element have spaces in it?
[11:21:06] <sanman_> does anyone know?
[11:21:26] <sanman_> <div id="blah blah">
[11:21:30] <Florin_Salam> sanman_: it can have spaces but then each word is a different id
[11:21:31] <BillCriswell> sanman_: No.
[11:21:46] <litropy> $(this).children('info').text() is of course only outputting the text, no tage
[11:21:48] <litropy> tags
[11:22:01] <BillCriswell> litropy: .html() ?
[11:22:01] <drej> so use .html()
[11:22:14] <litropy> Ah. of course.
[11:22:16] <Florin_Salam> sanman_: sorry, it can't, i'm tired, my mistake, that's for classes
[11:23:28] <BillCriswell> Florin_Salam: #foo\ bar { color: red; } that works scarily lol
[11:23:52] <BillCriswell> sanman_: Still shouldn't use that though.
[12:05:31] <jop008> I got oel filled then I use oel.html and then an error in IE8
[12:05:37] <jop008> can't see why
[12:06:58] <jop008> This was the issue http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5005
[12:20:04] <jdo_dk> I have a form with multiple buttons, when i push "enter" inside some of the inputs fields, it "push" the first button. I want to "push" button number 3 by default. What to do? The button is "pushed" before the form is submitted.
[12:23:27] <jeffmjack> is there a best practice for handling HTML inputs and submits?  It would be easy to forego the HTML methods with jquery or JS; anyone know anything about best practices for that sort of thing?
[12:23:48] <BillCriswell> jdo_dk: You can make them all buttons and the third one submit maybe?
[12:25:02] <jdo_dk> BillCriswelll: Will try, thanks.
[12:27:23] <jdo_dk> BillCriswell: I looks like it work, when using: <button type="button"... (number 1 and 2) and <button type="submit"...>
[12:27:53] <BillCriswell> jdo_dk: Nice.
[12:33:27] <Jaayyyy> Whats wrong with this code?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d9f789d282c46b631bd2
[12:35:00] <NoiseEee> Jaayyyy: i give up, what?
[12:35:26] <Jaayyyy> apparently tons of things
[12:35:45] <NoiseEee> what's the URL garbage about Jaayyyy, what are you trying to do?
[12:35:53] <NoiseEee> what is my_path?  what is params?
[12:36:21] <NoiseEee> start with the errors you're getting i suppose
[12:36:37] <Jaayyyy> params is rails stuff.  I'm trying to send google virtual pageviews with form submission success and errors
[12:37:03] <NoiseEee> well traditionally you send data via the "data" key in the ajax call
[12:37:15] <NoiseEee> i guess it would be wayyyyyy more helpful to pastebin the rendered javascript, no?
[12:41:20] <Jaayyyy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1574014299488cf25b4f
[12:42:19] <NoiseEee> Jaayyyy: seems like a rails problem, no?
[12:42:24] <saucey> hey guys
[12:42:39] <Jaayyyy> The javascript wont work in javascript console either
[12:42:42] <saucey> anyone know the best free tile manager for tinymce
[12:42:48] <NoiseEee> Jaayyyy: *what* javascript?
[12:42:57] <saucey> file
[12:42:58] <NoiseEee> Jaayyyy: you've pasted some stuff, but just about 0 legit javascript
[12:43:22] <Jaayyyy> lol
[12:43:39] <scrud> i confirm it's a rails problem and more exactely from haml
[12:43:50] <NoiseEee> Jaayyyy: i dont do rails but it looks like that last paste is a rails issue
[12:43:53] <NoiseEee> oh there ^^
[12:44:00] <Jaayyyy> Ok thanks
[12:44:07] <scrud> i have had that problem before, you just have a syntax error in your haml file, try to find it
[12:44:21] <Jaayyyy> Cool
[12:44:40] <saucey> hey guys
[12:45:00] <saucey> ive downloaded tinymce and im having problems upoloading images from my desktop
[12:45:24] <saucey> for starters the image uplod button doesnt work
[12:55:06] <saucey> is there anyone here that can help with tinymce
[12:56:21] <NoiseEee> saucey: your best bet is tinymce support forums i would think.
[12:56:39] <saucey> ok
[12:59:40] <davygshotme> Is there a way to create an event listener for when some one exits an iframe from fullscreen mode?
[13:01:40] <sanman_>     function addChkbx($button){
[13:01:41] <sanman_>     
[13:01:43] <sanman_>     var $input = $("input[type='checkbox']");
[13:01:44] <sanman_>       $input.attr( 'id', $button.find('img').attr('alt'));
[13:01:46] <sanman_>       $input.change(function(e) {
[13:01:46] <NoiseEee> sanman_: STOP
[13:01:47] <sanman_>     alert(e.type);
[13:01:49] <sanman_> });​
[13:01:50] <sanman_>     }
[13:01:55] <sanman_> how come this won't work?
[13:01:58] <sanman_> oops
[13:01:59] <sanman_> sorry
[13:02:09] <NoiseEee> sanman_: i won't even look at it until you give it to a proper pastebin :)
[13:02:19] <sanman_> I don't know how to use pastebin
[13:02:28] <sanman_> :)
[13:02:32] <NoiseEee> sanman_: https://gist.github.com/
[13:03:07] <davygshotme> Hey NoiseEee, can you check my question out?
[13:03:46] <davygshotme> Oh, nvm
[13:03:50] <davygshotme> I may have found it
[13:03:51] <NoiseEee> davygshotme: ok.
[13:03:54] <sanman_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/002bd23dfaba0e436bb6
[13:03:57] <NoiseEee> davygshotme: yeah im not aware of one
[13:03:59] <sanman_> is this ok?
[13:05:27] <NoiseEee> sanman_: what is that code supposed to do?
[13:05:51] <sanman_> it's supposed to add a checkbox which has a function bound to the Change event
[13:06:25] <sanman_> it adds the checkbox in front of a button
[13:06:55] <NoiseEee> if you want a new checkbox, then its:  var $input = $('<input>',{type:'checkbox'})
[13:07:13] <sanman_> but how do I control the placement of that checkbox?
[13:07:14] <NoiseEee> provide the full tag (ie: <>) when you want to create new DOM elements sanman_
[13:07:17] <sanman_> ie. where it's added
[13:07:43] <NoiseEee> sanman_: http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/ or any other DOM manipulation method that suits your fancy
[13:08:42] <sanman_> how about .before()  ?
[13:09:21] <NoiseEee> sanman_: yeah if you look at the documentation on the before() page you'd see "The .before() and .insertBefore() methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content and target."
[13:09:28] <NoiseEee> the documentation answers all
[13:09:43] <sanman_> hmm
[13:09:46] <sanman_> lemme try it
[13:10:17] <sanman_> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[13:10:39] <NoiseEee> sanman_: look at the examples and follow, good luck
[13:10:41] <sanman_> it doesn't like this:
[13:10:43] <sanman_> });​
[13:11:18] <NoiseEee> sanman_: fwiw when i copied and pasted your code, there was a hidden character in it
[13:11:26] <NoiseEee> so try typing fresh or something
[13:11:48] <sanman_> oh, ok
[13:12:42] <sanman_> oh wow, it works!! :)
[13:12:47] <sanman_> thanks for finding that hidden character
[13:12:49] <sanman_> now it works fine
[13:14:17] <davygshotme> NoiseEee it's done with javascript :l
[13:14:24] <davygshotme> just for future references
[13:16:24] <davygshotme> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10706070/how-to-detect-when-a-page-exits-fullscreen - pretty good to trigger certain events after an exit
[13:18:16] <NoiseEee> sweet thanks davygshotme
[13:18:30] <NoiseEee> np sanman_
[13:18:59] <davygshotme> it's a simple fix to my problem until I find the real issue ;(
[13:39:43] <philfromheck> Question, when using an attribute selector, how do you escape illegal characters? ie. $("[href='/&._']");
[13:42:42] <philfromheck> it's "\\" I hate you all.
[13:57:40] <datazombie> hi, I been trying to include foundation, query and slick.js into a project and when im doing the accordion and putting a slick.js div inside I dont the default behavior for this. Anyone have any opinions?
[14:15:46] <Raydiation> hi, i have a list of entry and when you click on them they expand
[14:16:05] <Raydiation> so my issue is: i have keyboard shortcuts that jump to the next/previous item
[14:16:23] <Raydiation> they should expand the entry so i simulate a trigger('click') on all open items
[14:16:39] <Raydiation> then i scroll the the previously stored next item and expand it
[14:16:51] <Raydiation> the issue is though that closing all entries moves the scrollbar
[14:16:59] <Raydiation> and its off somehow
[14:18:05] <Raydiation> so after the second jump im not at the second entry
[14:19:33] <Raydiation> it seems as if the position of an entry is calculated async
[14:22:12] <scrud> first of all did u use e.preventDefault() in your click handler(s)? because if not, it could lead to unwanted scrolling in the page
[14:23:46] <Raydiation> nope, dont use that
[14:23:50] <Raydiation> unwanted scrolling?
[14:24:00] <Raydiation> i dont have hash tags on them
[14:24:26] <scrud> ah ok, so this is not it
[14:25:26] <Raydiation> this is the code https://dpaste.de/WotY#L63
[14:28:21] <Raydiation> the interesting thing is: it works if i go backwards
[14:28:33] <Raydiation> ah right, the content above does not change
[14:28:39] <Raydiation> so the content is not being pushed down
[14:30:14] <scrud> do you have the same problem when actually clicking too?
[14:30:19] <Raydiation> no
[14:32:01] <wfq> hi guys
[14:32:19] <sekjal> hello, wfq
[14:33:21] <wfq> how coudl I handle the "OK" button of a dialog that is showing a result. For example, there  is a button on my form that says "Send". That goes to the server and bring back a result. When the user please on "OK", I'd like the page to reload. How could I do that last step please?
[14:34:30] <sekjal> location.reload() ?
[14:34:53] * sekjal doesn't know from experience, just guessing
[14:35:08] <wfq> sure but only when ok is pressed
[14:35:24] <wfq> I don't know how to know when OK is pressed
[14:36:06] <sekjal> $('#id_of_OK_element').on('click', function() { location.reload(); });
[14:36:15] <sekjal> I would think
[14:37:28] <wfq> sekjal, hmm that means that within the same function that I handle the success of the dialog I would call myself?
[14:38:11] <sekjal> oh, alert box elements?  I'm not really sure, then.  perhaps.
[14:38:12] <Raydiation> scrud: i think i solved it using a setTimeout for the scroll and expand, it looks quite ugly and flickers but well :P
[14:38:21] <sekjal> ::shrug::
[14:38:38] <wfq> I am meaning line 26 here: http://pastie.org/9546189
[14:38:39] <scrud> good then
[14:38:47] <wfq> That code is not mine by the way
[14:40:03] <TheSin> coudl someone tell me what i"m doing wrong, I'm setting autocomplete on a many fiels using a class, but I need to use _renderItem, the odd part is that it only applies the renderItem to the first autocomplete the rest work but now with teh custom renderItem
[14:40:50] <sekjal> wfq: looks like it a place to start, at least.  never tried anything like that before.
[14:41:04] <TheSin> I'm using $('.class').autocomplete(setupobject).data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = function (ul, item) {};
[14:41:16] <sekjal> i'm here to find out why my $(element).on('click', function()) is binding to pageload instead of click
[14:42:29] <TheSin> does somthing trigger a click on pageload?
[14:42:47] <sekjal> TheSin: nothing that I'm aware of
[14:44:07] <TheSin> that would be my first guess, specially since i have never had this happen to me before
[14:45:06] <sekjal> subsequent clicks go unregistered
[14:47:35] <sekjal> ah, got it.  I was calling the funciton directly, instead of wrapping it like on('click', function() { my_function(); });
[14:47:38] <bongjovi> Can anyone tell me why this is adding the class "visible" to the document body? : $('.info').toggleClass("visible"); $('body').toggleClass("info");
[14:47:50] <dmsuperman> sekjal: you can just do on('click', my_function)
[14:48:01] <dmsuperman> sekjal: I'm guessing you were doing on('click', my_function()) ?
[14:48:27] <sekjal> dmsuperman:  yes, I had the ().  that would make the code much cleaner
[14:48:31] <sekjal> thanks!
[14:52:46] <Distorzion> why if I do $(".menuCont").css('display', 'block'); .menuCont won't  change the way it's displayed when risize the window even if declared in css?
[15:10:08] <ripdog> i have a table inside of a div which has a height, display:relative; and overflow-y:auto;, making it a scrollable table. I am positioning absolute divs on top of that table, aligning with specific rows using jquery's .position(). This worked well when the table was not scrollable, but now that it is, it causes the .position() calls to give different results. I thought this wasn't supposed to happen,
[15:10:08] <ripdog> because position() returned positions based on distance from the top of the parent object.
[15:11:12] <ripdog> it works fine if I scroll to the top before placing the divs. there must be a better fix
[15:11:43] <bracky_> anyone good with crypto-js?
[15:11:51] <bracky_> specifically AES using crypto-js
[15:16:06] <scrubfest> What am I doing wrong here? https://bpaste.net/show/78661f6d55ce
[15:16:15] <scrubfest> Has to do with the .css
[15:21:10] <scrubfest> back :)
[15:27:51] <scrubfest> no1 knows?
[15:42:15] <ripdog> I found a solution for my issue with .position() - dont use jquery. the plain dom value offsetTop does what I want - ignore scroll position
[15:49:52] <ripdog> wow, bugs.jquery.com is really slow right now
[16:36:59] <P0RK> hey all, anybody know of a way to use jquery in a PDF?
[16:38:29] <thinkxl> P0RK: what do you mean?, jQuery is only used on the browser
[16:39:18] <P0RK> You can  use Javascript in pdf documents and jquery is javascript. I know it's been done, just not sure the best way to approach it.
[16:42:13] <drej> P0RK yes, pdfs (in adobe acrobat only) have some rudamentary javascript capability
[16:42:21] <drej> no, its nowhere near what a browser has in terms of a javascript engine
[16:42:31] <drej> therefore it cannot come close to running jquery in it
[16:42:44] <thinkxl> http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf
[17:00:44] <P0RK> with .filter() method, do you have to return an   element in the original jquery object being filtered or can you return any object?
[17:03:41] <ISmithers> Can anyone explain this: http://pastebin.com/N5HxQGeP ? (brb so please forgive my slow reply)
[17:09:04] <P0RK> ISmithers, did you try console.log(this)? It maybe be the html element rather than the jquery selection.
[17:10:31] <Prometheian> I'm trying to setup a bootstrap modal for a url, but the url is set using knockout. How can I set a data-remote to my element's href?
[17:24:39] <xMopxShell> Could anyone reccommend a jQuery plugin to organize content into a grid?
[17:24:55] <xMopxShell> kind of like how pinterest looks
[17:25:57] <unruthless> xMopxShell: check out masonry.js: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[17:26:34] <xMopxShell> unruthless: that looks absolutely perfect. thanks!
[17:28:25] <BostonGeorge2k> i know it's offtopic but could some1 help me out real quick. i am not a native english speaker and i need this sentence to be checked: Upon graduating, I will apply for a master degree in ... and I hope to eventually work for an innovative company in the ... industry.
[17:28:40] <BostonGeorge2k> does this make sense somehow? :) sorry for offtopic again
[17:31:35] <ISmithers> Perfect BostonGeorge2k :>
[17:32:19] <BostonGeorge2k> oh that's nice to hear!
[17:32:26] <Distorzion> why this is always false the first time? if($(this).attr('collapse')=='off'){
[17:32:32] <krizSol> hi folks
[17:32:47] <Distorzion> even if I set data-collapse="off"
[17:33:53] <tw2113> wouldn't it be attr('data-collapse')
[17:34:00] <tw2113> or data('collapse')
[17:34:50] <Distorzion> i know sorry i was trying to debug by myself
[17:35:05] <Distorzion> I'm using data('collapse'), but it's always empty first time
[17:35:11] <Distorzion> even if I set data-* tag
[17:35:34] <unruthless> Distorzion: you need to get the value of the `data-collapse` attribute, like this: $(this).attr(‘data-collapse')
[17:35:48] <krizSol> got a question which is sure easy for you guys, but i’m a jquery noob: i’ve got a json return like {„1“ : „First“} - i can output the „First“ by using „ui.item.label“ as well as „ui.item.value“ but how can i output the „1“??? is there something like „ui.item.key“?
[17:36:04] <Distorzion> I know, it was data not attr
[17:36:47] <unruthless> Distorzion: so, does if($(this).attr(‘data-collapse')=='off'){ work for you?
[17:36:58] <tw2113> with the missing '
[17:37:13] <BostonGeorge2k> Distorzion the problem is that you are checking for "data-collapse" and setting "collapse"
[17:39:46] <xMopxShell> unruthless: in masony.js, do you know if it's possible to set the number of columns and let it size cell widths accordingly? glancing over the docs point to no...
[17:40:37] <Distorzion> BostonGeorge2k, if($(this).attr('data-collapse')=='off'){ this is always false first time even if I set data-collapse="off"
[17:40:39] <xMopxShell> nevermind found how :)
[17:41:23] <unruthless> xMopxShell: :thumbs up:
[17:41:39] <Distorzion> even if I do if($(this).data('collapse')=='off'){ , same thing with
[17:42:23] <BostonGeorge2k> hmm could you provide you setup as a fiddle?
[17:42:35] <BostonGeorge2k> http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:44:17] <Distorzion> BostonGeorge2k, it's live here http://distorzion.com/u3
[17:44:34] <Distorzion> witdh <=767
[17:45:21] <Distorzion> just happens the first time, I guess i'm not looking correctly for the data-* tag
[17:46:48] <Distorzion> first time return undefined value
[17:47:03] <BostonGeorge2k> i remeber using true and false instead of on / off
[17:47:10] <BostonGeorge2k> but i dont know if this could cause it
[17:47:42] <Distorzion> would be the same, the problem is not finding the value i guess
[17:49:33] <BostonGeorge2k> so collapseAll();
[17:49:33] <BostonGeorge2k>  gets called the first time you open the pag
[17:50:28] <Distorzion> no, it's only declared there
[17:51:17] <BostonGeorge2k> hm i'm not much of a js coder but lets try to face this
[17:51:30] <BostonGeorge2k> we are talking about line 603-615 ?
[17:51:50] <Distorzion> yup
[17:52:12] <BostonGeorge2k> have you already made sure that vpwg is 1 ?
[17:53:01] <BostonGeorge2k> so the comparsion takes place?
[17:53:11] <Distorzion> yes
[17:53:32] <Distorzion> if you add console.log($(this).attr('data-collapse')); to the func it returns "undefined" in console
[17:54:28] <Distorzion> so it's not off nor on, thats why collapseAll() is being called, and sets "off" to the attr, and the next time you click, the value is found
[17:57:16] <BostonGeorge2k> what are you expecting
[17:58:48] <Distorzion> to retrieve the initial value <li class="sep"><a data-collapse="off"></a>
[17:59:20] <Distorzion> I can get around it easily, but I just want to know why this is happening
[17:59:38] <Distorzion> nvm... u.u im dumb
[17:59:48] <Distorzion> li has no data-collapse D: just saw
[18:00:19] <BostonGeorge2k> ok^^
[18:02:38] <sammych> does it matter if we use null or undefined for removing the value or reference for a variable?
[18:02:47] <sammych> obviously, null is less typing ;)
[18:23:59] <krizSol> hi. according to the docs (http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source) the ‚label‘ is used for the suggestions. how do i use ‚value‘ instead??
[18:25:07] <shoky> why not set the label to be the same as the value
[18:26:25] <shoky> oh actually you can just use only 'value' or only 'label' according to the docs
[18:28:42] <krizSol> i need the „label“ for the hidden-field i’m updating in the background
[18:30:12] <krizSol> infact „label“ is only the id of a record while „value“ holds the name. i need the ID to continue the form with
[18:30:17] <shoky> in any case, you can render the suggestions however you want by overriding _renderItem
[18:30:22] <shoky> example here  http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[18:51:17] <Getty> i am officially confused by the timeline of x-men days of the future past... but i think thats what they wanted to express with the title
[19:00:30] <jquery> hi all
[19:26:41] <ISmithers> Hey all, is there a way to get the width/height of an element that is only the content, not the additional values added by things like borders/drop-shadows?
[19:28:59] <ISmithers> Oh, innerWidth/innerHeight
[19:29:07] <ISmithers> Oh jQuery, you so smarts.
[19:37:32] <ISmithers> Hmm, that didn't work as planned. :<
[19:38:36] <sc_> hello, any performance hit from using multiple resize binds?
[20:01:19] <tw2113> you break the internet sc_
[20:06:47] <ISmithers> If I do: var borderCss = img.css("border"); how do I then access the properties of the returned property-value pairs?
[20:07:05] <ISmithers> Er, the values not the properties. So if I want borderTopWidth say, how does one get that from borderCss?
[20:07:41] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: You'd have to do .css('border-top-width') as far as  I  know.
[20:09:16] <ISmithers> OK, is there a shorthand way to get all the border values or it has to be done on a per case basis BillCriswell?
[20:10:33] <BillCriswell> I don't believe so. .css('border') doesn't seem to return anything at all.
[20:10:46] <BillCriswell> Oh, doesn't seem to all the time.
[20:11:52] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/heluvutuxusi/1/edit?html,css,js,output if you uncomment the second css property .css('border') doesn't return anything.
[20:14:29] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: Ah, so if you have different border widths .css('border') won't return anything.
[20:16:38] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: You can give an array to CSS and it'll return an object of the properties: http://jsbin.com/heluvutuxusi/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[20:34:27] <BillCriswell> Oh cool Bill thanks.
[21:05:27] <ISmithers> Hey sorry, I was out at lunch! Thanks BillCriswell :D
[21:05:36] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[21:07:53] <ISmithers> Yeah that's good I think. That way at least I dont' feel like I'm doing a lot of pointless queries.
[21:11:20] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[21:11:25] <BillCriswell> Bed time.
[21:22:03] <MapGuy99> I can't seem to update a value in a select box via jQuery - Example:   http://laudontech.com/kaecshiptracker/dropdown_test.php Code: http://pastebin.com/67cuvU0T
[21:22:39] <MapGuy99> Dropdown text should be set to "Select a floor plan"
[21:32:34] <ISmithers> var box = $('.item').css("boxShadow"); returns "rgb(136, 136, 136) 5px 5px 5px 0px" but is there a way to get the px sizes rather than just a string return?
[21:32:41] <MapGuy99> Perhaps if I populate the select via PHP, it isn't available to jQuery?
[21:43:38] <MapGuy99> Can you apply jQuery to HTML generated by PHP?
[21:43:50] <tw2113> yes
[21:43:58] <tw2113> the html will already be rendered and sent to the browser
[21:44:02] <tw2113> before jquery is even run
[21:53:04] <MapGuy99> >>tw2113 - that's what I thought, but does not appear to be the case here:  http://laudontech.com/kaecshiptracker/dropdown_test.php
[21:53:23] <tw2113> what type of jquery are you trying to run?
[21:53:28] <MapGuy99> >>tw2113 http://pastebin.com/67cuvU0T
[21:53:32] <tw2113> ajax?
[21:53:37] <MapGuy99> update a select
[21:55:19] <tw2113> no idea why, but i'm getting jQuery is not defined errors when i try to use dev tools
[21:55:38] <tw2113> and jquery isn't showing up in the debugger tab
[21:56:21] <tw2113> so that's your primary issue right there
[21:57:07] <MapGuy99> Seems Ok in Firefox?
[21:57:18] <tw2113> that's the browser i tested in
[21:57:25] <MapGuy99> I would get erros if jquery did not load
[21:58:27] <tw2113> in Chrome, any time i try to use a selector, i get an empty array
[21:58:28] <tw2113> []
[21:58:39] <MapGuy99> >>tw2113 - Are you using this URL?  http://laudontech.com/kaecshiptracker/dropdown_test.php
[21:58:48] <tw2113> yep
[21:59:30] <shoky> MapGuy99: #selectFloor is for id="selectFloor"
[21:59:34] <shoky> MapGuy99:  $('select[name=selectFloor]').val('Select a floor plan')
[21:59:55] <shoky> jQuery working fine for me there btw
[22:00:15] <tw2113> TypeError: $(...).val is not a function
[22:00:38] <shoky> works fine here
[22:01:00] <tw2113> not working in any browser for me
[22:01:36] <MapGuy99> <shoky> - thanks, just needed a second set of eyes...been up way too late!
[22:02:51] <tw2113> my computer is a freak apparently
[22:03:07] <shoky> takes after you
[22:04:28] <tw2113> *shrug*
[22:06:16] <tw2113> I made a funny earlier shoky https://twitter.com/tw2113/status/510220680533536769
[22:06:18] <b-ot> tw2113: @tw2113: I love a man…his name is JSON. He's nice. He's handsome. He plays well with both PHP and Javascript. it's a match made in heaven.
[22:10:43] <shoky> you a funny freak

[22:39:03] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:58:23] <Kartagis> hi
[23:00:04] <Kartagis> I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'm going to ask this straight. I'm looking for a dependent dropdown where the second menu items should be pulled from database. I found an example but it doesn't involve in a database. can you help?
[23:03:43] <Kartagis> I think I got one, I'll try that first
[23:06:39] <Kartagis> what's the difference between jQuery(document).ready(function() { ... } and $(document).ready(function() { ... } ?
[23:16:03] <abailarri> Hello. I'm tryin to delete an element of array with splice, but I not get any result. Anyone can help me please? http://jsfiddle.net/zpfy6az2/
[23:16:39] <abailarri> is http://jsfiddle.net/zpfy6az2/1/
[23:19:16] <Cork> abailarri: Object { 1={...}} is not an array
[23:19:25] <Cork> as the output states it is a object
[23:19:49] <Cork> if you want an array you need to get the (i suspect json) input to use an array instead
[23:19:56] <Cork> { 1: value }
[23:20:02] <Cork> vs [value]
[23:20:10] <abailarri> Cork, yes, the output of value is a object
[23:20:12] <Cork> the second one will be zero based not one based
[23:20:50] <Cork> abailarri: you have one array and three objects
[23:20:53] <Cork> not three arays
[23:20:57] <abailarri> yes I see
[23:21:16] <Cork> if you splice an object you will crash
[23:21:21] <abailarri> I want to delete the user object of value object
[23:21:26] <Cork> cause you can't splice an object
[23:21:27] <Cork> no
[23:21:32] <Cork> you can set the key to undefined
[23:21:38] <Cork> well actually
[23:21:45] <Cork> you can do delete obj.key
[23:22:04] <Cork> but a better solution is to fix the broken source you have
[23:22:24] <alexw> is it possible to json_encode a field upon submission?
[23:22:28] <alexw> sorry
[23:22:37] <alexw> Is it possible to encode a group of fields on submit?
[23:22:51] <Cork> alexw: what do you mean by group
[23:23:13] <Cork> and actually, what do you mean by fields
[23:23:17] <alexw> I have fields like shares_0_unpaid shares_0_paid and shares_1_unpaid shares_1_paid
[23:23:26] <alexw> I want to group them into an array on form submit
[23:23:52] <alexw> <input name="shares_0_unpaid">
[23:24:02] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com serializeArray
[23:24:04] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[23:24:24] <alexw> I'm not using ajax - just good old fields
[23:24:28] <alexw> forms*
[23:24:39] <alexw> can I add it as an hidden field maybe?
[23:26:01] <jop008> IE8 rendering my site on IE8 is rendered poorly http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-09-12_at_08.16.44-E6QUqexM.png looks like the CSS is treated differently
[23:26:25] <jop008> Normal lookout of the site is http://www.happyaway.nl
[23:28:49] <Cork> alexw: ah, now i get the question
[23:29:00] <Cork> alexw: http form submission isn't json encoded
[23:29:22] <Cork> alexw: so ya, you would have to do it in js and store it as a hidden field
[23:29:32] <Cork> but that would break without js
[23:29:42] <Cork> so i wouldn't recommend that solution'
[23:32:39] <alexw> The entire form relies on JS :P
[23:32:43] <alexw> So I'm not concerned
[23:33:43] <Cork> pity
[23:33:51] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/120497/ <--- hi. I have this code. if I remove the comments, it doesn't work. if I leave it as is, it works. why do they conflict?
[23:35:09] <Cork> Kartagis: your trying to date diff = elm1 - elm2
[23:35:13] <Cork> and that isn't possible
[23:35:22] <Cork> you can't subtract a dom element from another dom element
[23:35:40] <Cork> or rather one jquery wrapped dom element from another jquery wrapped dom element
[23:35:48] <Cork> Kartagis: so what is it your trying to do?
[23:35:54] <Cork> *you're
[23:36:05] <Kartagis> Cork: you know what? I've just realised that, one second before you told me
[23:36:50] <Kartagis> Cork: in the commented out parts, I'm trying to calculate the number of days selected
[23:37:08] <Cork> so you missed the .val() call
[23:38:13] <Kartagis> nod.val you mean?
[23:38:25] <Kartagis> Cork: or the fields?
[23:38:48] <Cork> parseInt(jQuery('#edit-field-number-of-days-und-0-value').val(), 10)
[23:38:59] <Cork> Kartagis: also on line 12 never EVER do parseInt(val)
[23:39:05] <Cork> you should always add the base
[23:39:11] <Cork> parseInt(val, base)
[23:39:49] <Cork> also remember to replace the ; with , in your code
[23:39:54] <Cork> or you will create global variables
[23:40:21] <Kartagis> you mean var foo = bar, ?
[23:40:44] <Cork> that or the var foo = bar, foo2 = bar2;
[23:40:56] <Cork> you use the later in the code your modifying
[23:41:26] <Kartagis> I though , was used just to save time and space
[23:41:41] <Cork> you save three chars
[23:41:51] <Kartagis> var foo=bar,food=fruit;
[23:41:57] <Cork> not so it matters
[23:42:12] <Kartagis> but this usage is correct?
[23:42:15] <Cork> but yes the var statement is what you need
[23:42:16] <Cork> yes
[23:42:29] <Cork> you can linebreak after the , too
[23:42:33] <Cork> like you do
[23:42:49] <Kartagis> var f = new Date(jQuery('#edit-field-opening-kilometer-und-0-value')), <--- is this acceptable?
[23:43:11] <Cork> no
[23:43:19] <Cork> you can't convert a dom element to a date element
[23:43:23] <Cork> *object
[23:43:36] <Kartagis> so I need .val() ?
[23:43:39] <Cork> ya
[23:43:50] <alexw> should we be using $(document).ready(function() {
[23:43:53] <Cork> and the string in the field needs to be in a format that date can pase
[23:43:58] <Kartagis> var f = new Date(jQuery('#edit-field-opening-kilometer-und-0-value').val()), <--- is this acceptable?
[23:44:25] <Cork> Kartagis: possibly, depending on what value you have in the field
[23:44:37] <Cork> alexw: too generic a question to answer
[23:44:41] <Kartagis> Cork: I have 2014-10-12
[23:44:42] <Cork> depends on where and when
[23:44:50] <Cork> Kartagis: then i think no
[23:44:52] <Cork> let me check
[23:45:53] <Cork> Kartagis: ya, you can't give that to new Date and get a consistent result
[23:46:35] <Kartagis> var start = new Date("2010-04-01"), I got this from a SO post, and it works
[23:47:10] <Cork> well as long as you never touch timestamp, hours, minutes or seconds
[23:47:25] <Cork> you might be safe
[23:47:42] <Cork> but different browsers handles the missing time and timezone areas differently
[23:48:14] <Cork> (and yes date handling in js SUCKS)
[23:48:27] <Kartagis> Cork: so I think I need split() as well
[23:48:42] <Kartagis> because I remembered it also includes time
[23:49:11] <Cork> Kartagis: ya, you're prob better of parsing the string yourself
[23:49:23] <Kartagis> is there a bot here on which I can test?
[23:49:32] <Cork> there is, but please don't
[23:49:37] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
