[00:04:22] <mwdev> Cork, wow cork that was everything in one? ive been working on this for 6hours. is the true or false you were talking about the (width <=499) ?
[00:05:26] <IamTrying> mwdev: that is the difference between Guru Cork and normal developers.
[00:09:50] <mwdev> just started on irc this week and my god this is so much different and helpful then like stackoverflow lol. will be here for the rest of my life
[00:10:12] <Uhkis> yet another soul lost to irc
[00:11:31] <Xenith88> Hello world!
[00:59:00] <froginvasion> Does anyone have an idea how this is possible with jquery validator? I use .rules("add", ...) and .rules("remove") on input elements, but it adds it to the complete form
[03:01:10] <vespadj> Hi! Best way to work with an Array of Objects? e.g. people contains many person{name:'...' , age: '...'} .  How get the item (person)  'John' (name=='John') for using it?
[03:03:13] <Cork> vespadj: don't double post
[03:16:23] <Guddu> Why does a List Item show up as Object Object instead of the text that I am getting from the server?
[03:16:29] <Guddu> The server get returns [{"pk": "AAAA11", "match": "AAAA11 - A&amp;D EMBALAJE LTDA.", "value": {"transporter_name": "A&D EMBALAJE LTDA.", "vehicle_plate_number": "AAAA11"}, "repr": "AAAA11 - A&amp;D EMBALAJE LTDA."}]
[03:16:59] <Cork> Guddu: guessing, but most likely cause you do alert(data)
[03:17:13] <Cork> and json is parsed to an object by jquery, so you can work with it
[03:17:39] <Cork> Guddu: do console.log(data) instead
[03:17:52] <Cork> and you should get a more useful output of the content
[03:18:50] <Guddu> Cork, Thanks a lot for your response.
[03:18:57] <Guddu> I saw that content in JS Console. I went to Network tab and selected the network call corresponding to the ajax call to get that text.
[03:19:11] <PCatinean> hey guys, can one do "$( ".product_config_form select" ) ?
[03:19:15] <PCatinean> .each()
[03:19:23] <Uhkis> of course
[03:19:24] <PCatinean> for all selects in that element with that class?
[03:19:31] <PCatinean> so it works just like css selectors nice!
[03:19:46] <Omar-> yup
[03:19:53] <Uhkis> it is css selector engine
[03:20:02] <PCatinean> ahh nice :D
[03:20:03] <Cork> PCatinean: it works like css selectors cause they are :)
[03:20:04] <Uhkis> sizzle or something
[03:20:38] <Cork> sizzle is just the compatibility layer that lets jquery extend it
[03:20:48] <Cork> but the core of it is document.querySelectorAll
[03:24:18] <PCatinean> so much knowledge here :O
[03:24:20] <PCatinean> :D
[03:28:24] <jgl> I have a textarea with 3 buttons, btn A displays text A in textArea, same with btn B, btn C deletes all content in textArea. If textarea is filled using btn A or B, works ok, but if text is edited manually, delete button does not delete the text. Anyway, when I see the html code,  the code is updated In the correct way.
[03:30:20] <Guddu> Please help
[03:30:53] <Uhkis> !ask @ Guddu
[03:30:53] <b-ot> Guddu: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:31:32] <Omar-> jgl how to you delete textarea's text? $("foo").val("")?
[03:33:18] <jgl> Omar-:  $('#textAreaMsg').contents().filter(function() {return this.nodeType == 3; }).remove();
[03:35:32] <Guddu> I posted my question earlier. Here it is. Why does a List Item show up as Object Object instead of the text that I am getting from the server?
[03:35:33] <Guddu> The server get returns [{"pk": "AAAA11", "match": "AAAA11 - A&amp;D EMBALAJE LTDA.", "value": {"transporter_name": "A&D EMBALAJE LTDA.", "vehicle_plate_number": "AAAA11"}, "repr": "AAAA11 - A&amp;D EMBALAJE LTDA."}]
[03:35:40] <Guddu> I saw that content in JS Console. I went to Network tab and selected the network call corresponding to the ajax call to get that text
[03:35:57] <jgl> Oh I have to leave for today, thank you for your help Omar- I will try again tomorrow.
[03:37:13] <Uhkis> Guddu: you were also answered earlier
[03:38:30] <Guddu> Uhkis, Sorry bt i did nt get a answer. There was also a moment that i got disconnected. Could you please resend the answer?
[03:44:33] <Guddu> Cork, Please don't mind. I am not sure if you answered something back to me again. There was a moment that i got disconnected from IRC.
[03:47:04] <Omar-> is is recommended to call a function from with a function? e.g. function foo() { $ajax(); bar(); }
[03:47:24] <Cork> Guddu: like i said last, make sure you check the response data with console.log
[03:47:27] <vespadj> Guddu: something like [ {...}, {...} ]   is un array of object.   Try  .done(function(response){ console.log(response) ;  })
[03:47:42] <Cork> Guddu: also is this call cross domain?
[03:48:36] <Guddu> Cork, No. This is on local host.
[03:48:49] <Guddu> cork vespadj I saw that content in JS Console. I went to Network tab and selected the network call corresponding to the ajax call to get that text
[03:48:49] <froginvasion> Omar it depends, do not call jQuery event binding inside functions you might call multiple times, as that will mess up
[03:48:50] <Cork> Guddu: same port?
[03:49:04] <Guddu> cork Apache is on port 8999
[03:49:11] <Cork> then it IS cross domain
[03:49:15] <Cork> and that means you can't get to the data
[03:49:22] <Cork> the browser will block you
[03:49:58] <Cork> prot://fqdn:port has to match exactly or you have cross domain
[03:51:05] <Guddu> Cork, vespadj My Ajax Lookup URL is this
[03:51:06] <Guddu> http://127.0.0.1:8999/GDD/autocomplete/lookup/ajax_lookup/VehicleLookUp?term=AAAA1
[03:51:16] <Guddu> If i paste it in Browser directly I do get a response
[03:51:28] <Cork> Guddu: what url is the page loaded from?
[03:51:41] <Guddu> http://127.0.0.1:8999/GDD/ is the home URL
[03:51:49] <Guddu> Cork ^
[03:52:00] <Cork> so you basically make an ajax call to /GDD/autocomplete/lookup/ajax_lookup/VehicleLookUp?term=AAAA1 ?
[03:52:44] <Omar-> froginvasion those functions are ajax calls only
[03:53:10] <Guddu> Cork yes. And that's what the Ajax lookup field should show. It shows Object Object instead . . . Image at http://imgur.com/BFAN60W
[03:54:02] <froginvasion> Omar, yes, but bear in mind that bar() will be directly executed after $ajax(), and cannot access the data from the request
[03:54:05] <Cork> Guddu: you have to convert the object to string if you want to take the json response and put it in a text field
[03:54:18] <Cork> Guddu: JSON.stringify(data) should work
[03:54:41] <Omar-> froginvasion well, I'm calling bar() on complete
[03:55:01] <Cork> Omar-: what are you trying to do exactly?
[03:55:11] <froginvasion> so then $.ajax({complete: bar}); ?
[03:55:51] <froginvasion> if the function you are calling is something you'd use elsewhere than just your ajax request, then you could do something like that yes;
[03:56:15] <froginvasion> i.e. function bar(data) { ... }; and somewhere else $.ajax({complete: bar});
[03:56:43] <Cork> or $.ajax().always(bar)
[03:58:04] <Omar-> froginvasion Cork http://jsfiddle.net/oopskva2/ the code works well
[03:58:35] <Omar-> i'm asking if the way i'm doing it is correct/recommended
[03:58:36] <Cork> Omar-: you wrote it after the ajax call
[03:58:40] <Cork> not in the callback
[03:58:44] <Omar-> whether it has any cons
[03:58:49] <Cork> so ya, that is a different thing
[03:58:56] <Cork> no it should be fine
[03:59:03] <Omar-> exactly, I want to execute a callback
[03:59:10] <Cork> Omar-: i would recommend not using the .append in a loop though
[03:59:31] <Cork> also x isn't defined
[04:00:03] <Omar-> it's defined at the beginning of the function
[04:00:03] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/f3vve6ks/1/
[04:00:18] <Omar-> underneath var subs = []
[04:00:23] <Cork> why would you want to have it leak outside the callback?
[04:00:26] <ij> "$('.bunch > .form').formset({...});") works differently than "$('.bunch').find('> .form').formset({...});" Why could that be so?
[04:00:49] <Cork> ij: it shouldn't
[04:01:14] <ij> That's what I thought. I'll check it one more time.
[04:01:25] <Omar-> Cork, thanks for the fiddle, looks cleaner
[04:01:36] <Cork> it isn't so much cleaner, but faster
[04:01:50] <Omar-> Cork how can I convert it into a callback?
[04:01:51] <Cork> as you don't do multiple dom modifications
[04:02:03] <Cork> Omar-: convert what into a callback?
[04:02:19] <Omar-> and what should I run in the callback? bar() or the appending code?
[04:02:31] <Cork> Omar-: convert what into a callback?
[04:02:36] <ij> Okay, that works, I messed up.
[04:02:42] <Omar-> Cork I mean, how to use callback
[04:03:03] <Cork> Omar-: just take an argument to the function and call the name you gave it
[04:03:08] <Cork> callbacks isn't more then that
[04:03:10] <PCatinean> How do I select a tag by it's name?
[04:03:18] <Cork> PCatinean: you write it
[04:03:27] <PCatinean> what do you mean?
[04:03:28] <Cork> or did you mean the name="" ?
[04:03:49] <Cork> $('div') will select divs
[04:04:05] <Cork> $('input[name="user"]') will select the input with the name user
[04:04:19] <PCatinean> ahh that's it, great thanks Cork !
[04:04:34] <PCatinean> and I can insert a variable there in stead of string "user" with + var + "] ?
[04:04:52] <Cork> ah ya, but...
[04:04:57] <PCatinean> not good?
[04:05:08] <Cork> it isn't normally a grate idea to concat selectors
[04:05:26] <Cork> unless you're sure the data you concat is controlled
[04:05:36] <Cork> and it still normally make the code harder to read
[04:06:02] <PCatinean> I have like 10 select boxes and some values can only be available if certain other value from another box it depends on has those values
[04:06:18] <Cork> something like var form = $('#form'); form.find('input').filter(function() { return this.name == variable; });
[04:06:21] <Cork> is normally safer
[04:06:24] <PCatinean> So it should limit the options when a field is changed and deselect the value if the option is no longer available after a parent has been changed
[04:06:42] <PCatinean> Ah so you are sure it's there in the DOM and doesn't break
[04:07:07] <Cork> well no so you know it doens't get random weird characters you need to escape into the selector string
[04:07:11] <Cork> kinda like sql injection
[04:07:48] <PCatinean> Surely it cannot be done with js, XSS or something similar
[04:08:15] <Cork> it isn't isn't a security problem
[04:08:22] <Cork> as $() doesn't execute the code
[04:08:38] <Cork> but you could still get a selector breaking cause the content of the variable needs to be escaped
[04:08:40] <PCatinean> But more like a reliability/stability issue
[04:08:47] <Cork> ya
[04:08:52] <PCatinean> That makes sense
[04:08:56] <Cork> i used the sql injection as a reference
[04:09:00] <Cork> cause you have the same escape problem
[04:09:12] <Cork> while .filter doesn't
[04:09:27] <Cork> the name either matches or it don't
[04:09:31] <PCatinean> At the end of the day I'm not even sure if this is the best thing to do, encode the dependencies in the dom and use jquery to manipulate the selection fields, I think ajax calls to the server would be safer but
[04:09:38] <Cork> you can't break cause of the content of the name
[04:10:17] <Cork> PCatinean: if it isn't too much data i would use the data- prefix
[04:10:20] <Cork> and just store it there
[04:10:49] <PCatinean> Though for someone experiencing some issues with internet connection it would be neat to have it all client-side
[04:10:57] <PCatinean> Thought checks must be made server-side so no dirty data can come in
[04:11:06] <Cork> yup
[04:11:11] <PCatinean> Btw how do I select the parent? I have .class_of_form select
[04:11:18] <PCatinean> how do I do it $(this).parent() ?
[04:11:21] <PCatinean> so I refer to the form
[04:11:22] <Cork> you don't
[04:11:29] <Cork> css never ever selects backwards
[04:11:48] <PCatinean> I remember there was a way to get the parent of the element in jquery, I could be wrong
[04:11:57] <Cork> so in jquery you have to do $('.class_of_form select').parent()
[04:12:21] <Cork> or $('.class_of_form select').closest('.class_of_form')
[04:12:31] <Cork> depending on how far up you need to go
[04:12:40] <PCatinean> $(this).parent().find('input').filter(function() { return this.name == variable; }); so this won't work?
[04:12:58] <Cork> it would
[04:13:06] <Cork> or you could just use .siblings('input')
[04:13:13] <PCatinean> siblings as well yeaa right
[04:13:28] <PCatinean> and in the find I can do the search by attribute thing
[04:13:38] <Cork> sure
[04:13:43] <PCatinean> $(this).siblings().find('select[name="'+ depends_id +'"]').filter(function() { return this.name == variable; });
[04:14:01] <Cork> the idea was to not have the name filter in the find :)
[04:14:04] <Cork> uh
[04:14:06] <Cork> wait no
[04:14:09] <Cork> what?
[04:14:17] * PCatinean gets tense
[04:14:20] <PCatinean> what did I do? XD
[04:14:23] <Cork> PCatinean: that line looks weird
[04:14:45] <Cork> $(this).siblings() will collect all the siblings of the current element
[04:14:48] <PCatinean> I need to look for the sibling select field that has the name set on this select fields "depends" attribute
[04:14:58] <Cork> and then .find will search through there children for a select element
[04:15:11] <Cork> and then you filter that again based on the name
[04:15:22] <Cork> even though you used that in the find selector
[04:15:32] <Cork> it feels very redundant on several levels
[04:15:56] <Cork> $(this).siblings('select').filter(function() { return this.name == depends_id; });
[04:15:59] <PCatinean> So the task is basically to find a sibling select field that has name == $(this).attr('name'])
[04:16:00] <Cork> is what i would guess at
[04:16:22] <PCatinean> wouldn't that return a expression True/False?
[04:16:27] <Cork> no
[04:16:39] <PCatinean> ah okay was thinking in python terms
[04:16:41] <Cork> the filter filters the set of elements in the array
[04:16:51] <Cork> if you return false the element won't be included
[04:16:58] <PCatinean> ah wait now I looked at it a bit better, the callback is set on the filter
[04:17:09] <PCatinean> kinda like inheriting the sort function in python
[04:17:56] * PCatinean tests
[04:18:15] <PCatinean> smth went wrong
[04:18:15] <froginvasion> PCatinean, are you a python programmer? ;)
[04:18:35] <PCatinean> froginvasion, yup :)
[04:18:37] <Cork> PCatinean: could you write a jsfiddle on the dom structure you're trying to work with
[04:18:39] <PCatinean> var dep_attr = $(this).siblings().find('select').filter(function() { return this.name == depends_id;});
[04:18:51] <Cork> would make this much less of a guess work
[04:19:11] <froginvasion> PCatinean, I advise you to read "JavaScript the good parts", it will help you understand JS much better if you ever have trouble
[04:19:26] <PCatinean> froginvasion, thanks for the suggestion
[04:19:36] <PCatinean> Wow people here are a lot more helpful and nice than I remember
[04:19:47] <froginvasion> filter is am ethod on a jQuery element, and it passes a function as in a higher-order function. I think you can do stuff like that as well in Python right?
[04:19:48] <PCatinean> or was it #javascript where it was filled with aholes?
[04:20:09] <PCatinean> froginvasion, exactly, you can pass a function as a parameter to the sorting function
[04:20:12] <Cork> PCatinean: javascript is usually ok too
[04:20:15] <PCatinean> that is used to do the sorting
[04:20:17] <Cork> #css has a bad prep though
[04:20:24] <Cork> *rep
[04:20:32] <PCatinean> It was one of them can't remember exactly
[04:20:36] <Cork> and php has among the worst
[04:20:47] <froginvasion> I can imagine some of them have jerks in them...
[04:20:51] <PCatinean> i didn't have issues there if I remember, I used it for like 5 years
[04:20:56] <froginvasion> #ruby is friendly as well normally
[04:21:01] <PCatinean> python is like the best
[04:21:04] <Cork> ya
[04:21:11] <PCatinean> super awesome helpful people
[04:21:14] <Cork> rubyonrails is more of a hit an miss though
[04:21:21] <PCatinean> hehe :))
[04:21:40] <froginvasion> rails is.. a special beast
[04:21:50] <PCatinean> so this should take all siblings of the element, take all selects and filter the ones that have name == depends_id: $(this).siblings().find('select').filter(function() { return this.name == depends_id;});
[04:21:58] <PCatinean> in theory
[04:22:04] <PCatinean> though no way
[04:22:06] <PCatinean> you just explained that
[04:22:08] <PCatinean> sorry!
[04:22:11] <Cork> PCatinean: no
[04:22:18] <PCatinean> searches the children
[04:22:25] <Cork> that finds all siblings then in that set of siblings search for select elements
[04:22:44] <Cork> meaning the select can't be sibling it would have to be children of the siblings
[04:22:54] <PCatinean> $(this).parent().find('select').filter(function() { return this.name == depends_id;});
[04:23:02] <PCatinean> Then if I do it through the parent...
[04:23:11] <Cork> PCatinean: could you please provide the fiddle i asked for
[04:23:37] <Cork> we are not psychics
[04:23:49] <Cork> to say what you need we would need to see the structure
[04:26:10] <PCatinean> Make sense, hold on I don't think I've done this before
[04:27:33] <PCatinean> Cork, I most likely messed up: https://jsfiddle.net/LuxkLn99/
[04:28:23] <Cork> and you need to find the next select box in the list?
[04:28:44] <Cork> PCatinean: also don't invent random attribute names outside the data- scope
[04:28:59] <Cork> so prefix depends so you get data-depends
[04:29:12] <PCatinean> Sorry I didn't get that?
[04:29:25] <Cork> <option depends="[]" name="6"> => <option data-depends="[]" name="6">
[04:29:28] * PCatinean already owned Cork a beer for the support he got so far
[04:30:02] <PCatinean> ah it is like a convention to make it easier to read?
[04:30:08] <PCatinean> to prefix with data-?
[04:30:21] <Cork> no it is to prevent name conflicts with the html standard
[04:30:34] <PCatinean> there is a depends standard html?
[04:30:36] <PCatinean> or could be?
[04:30:41] <PCatinean> ok fair point will change
[04:30:42] <Cork> it might be in the future
[04:30:51] <Cork> anyway $(this).closest('.form-group').nextAll('.form-group').first().find('select')
[04:30:59] <Cork> something like that should work
[04:31:03] <Cork> anyway i got to run
[04:31:20] <PCatinean> Cork, thanks a lot for your help so far!
[04:31:24] <PCatinean> Much appreciated
[04:33:59] <Omar-> .push() with strings, how to make it work with jquery object?

[05:04:43] <neanderslob> hi all; I'm attempting to compare two strings as described in this gist: https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/457db45accf22c42fa55
[05:05:35] <neanderslob> it's basically taking a string of letters and seeing if they compare to the first n letters of a particular string
[05:06:09] <neanderslob> if anyone knows a slick way to do this, I'd appreciate it!
[05:10:38] <Lebbe> neanderslob: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/uz8jh8uL/
[05:10:59] <neanderslob> Lebbe: thanks for the response, let me have a look
[05:13:01] <Lebbe> i dont do it with jquery though. since string comparison would be a strange thing to do in jquery.
[05:14:06] <neanderslob> Lebbe: sorry, I didn't mean for the n to be a predetermined constant; if the test variable is 4 letters long, then n would be 4
[05:14:18] <Lebbe> ah ok
[05:14:26] <Lebbe> give me 2 sec
[05:14:48] <neanderslob> Lebbe: cool thanks
[05:15:10] <Lebbe> what should happen if test string is longer than template string?
[05:15:28] <neanderslob> Lebbe: would return false
[05:15:54] <neanderslob> Lebbe: also would return false (in terms of the example) if the test string is texthere
[05:16:19] <neanderslob> Lebbe: so, in a manner of speaking. the wildcard is only to the right of the test string
[05:16:38] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/fjm42sxq/
[05:18:31] <Lebbe> but you could also use
[05:18:38] <Lebbe> template.indexOf(test) === 0
[05:19:15] <neanderslob> Lebbe: which one would you recommend?
[05:19:20] <Lebbe> the last one
[05:19:34] <Lebbe> because that is probably what your teacher was after in the first place
[05:20:08] <neanderslob> Lebbe: hah, wish I was learning under a teacher; unfortunately those days are long gone
[05:20:22] <Lebbe> okay. it was a shot in the dark :P
[05:20:32] <neanderslob> Lebbe: no worries
[05:20:33] <Lebbe> sounded like a typical home assignment
[05:20:41] <neanderslob> Lebbe: hey thanks a lot; I really appreciate it
[05:21:21] <Lebbe> but the indexOf trick is neat for this case
[05:21:56] <neanderslob> Lebbe: right on; seems nice and concise
[05:23:53] <Lebbe> if you want to be devious you can do something like this
[05:23:54] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/7ps0jdzz/
[05:27:33] <neanderslob> Lebbe: wow that's slick
[05:28:36] <neanderslob> Lebbe: and that's just javascript; no library?
[05:28:43] <Lebbe> pure javascript
[05:28:49] <Lebbe> the best language ever
[05:29:04] <Omar-> Lebbe that is neat ;)
[05:31:14] <Lebbe> thank you. though not everyone likes the idea of extending native types like that.
[05:32:33] <Cork> Lebbe: ya, that has already bit the es standard body several times
[05:32:38] <Cork> so... not the best idea
[05:33:02] <Cork> latest was with Array.contains if i remember correctly
[05:33:38] <Lebbe> yeah
[05:33:45] <Cork> (and they had to rename the functions to .includes instead)
[05:34:01] <Cork> and we'll have to see if that name sticks
[05:34:21] <Lebbe> so dont do stuff like that in librarier meant to be used by others etc
[05:34:28] <Cork> ya
[05:34:42] <Lebbe> but in private code for your own apps. go ahead, and take the hit yourself if/when conflicts occur.
[05:34:48] <Cork> i think it was... bootstrap extending array with .contains
[05:34:59] <manrajgrover> Hi. I have just submitted a pull request. May I know why I got CLA-Error label?
[05:35:04] <Cork> but not with a compatible solution to what the standard designed
[05:35:27] <Cork> manrajgrover: #jquery-dev
[05:35:27] <Lebbe> i think it is pretty pretty safe to define String.startsWith for your own use.
[05:35:37] <Cork> sure
[05:35:41] <manrajgrover> Cork: Okay thanks :)
[05:35:51] <Cork> its when it ends up on large quantities of sites it becomes a big problem
[05:36:20] <Cork> and why the way jquery does these things is a better solution (the ex prototype does)
[05:36:38] <Cork> it's actually one of the reasons i moved to jquery way back
[05:49:45] <PCatinean> How does one introduce a jquery breakpoint
[05:49:50] <PCatinean> so I can print variables and such
[05:49:50] <PCatinean> ?
[05:50:07] <Cork> PCatinean: not sure what you mean
[05:50:15] <Cork> that is a browser feature not a jquery one
[05:50:33] <PCatinean> Like a python breakpoint, execution stop at the place where you insert the code and can execute stuff from the scope where it stopped
[05:50:47] <Lebbe> you can write "debugger" in t he part of the code you want it to stop
[05:50:49] <Lebbe> as an expression
[05:51:03] <PCatinean> just debugger?
[05:51:06] <Lebbe> yes
[05:51:08] <Cork> debugger;
[05:51:22] <Cork> and it depends on the browser supporting it
[05:51:28] <Lebbe> you can also set breakpoints in you browser debugger
[05:51:28] <Cork> it most likely does though
[05:51:40] <Lebbe> you have to have the browser javascript console up for it to work
[05:51:59] <Cork> it depends on the browser actually
[05:52:04] <Lebbe> oh
[05:52:12] <Lebbe> fuck are you sure?
[05:52:17] <Lebbe> i have production code with debugger in it
[05:52:19] <Cork> yes
[05:52:36] <Lebbe> haha, well i have some commits to do
[05:52:37] <Cork> the debugger listener needs to be active in the browser though
[05:52:38] <Lebbe> l8r
[05:52:45] <Cork> but the console doesn't have to be open
[05:52:53] <Lebbe> hmm
[05:53:16] <Cork> so ya, leaving debugger around in production is prob a bad idea
[05:53:43] <Lebbe> i have it some places where the code shouldnt have come, like in the end of a switch statement
[05:53:44] <Cork> not a catastrophe, but you should prob plan for removing it
[05:53:51] <Cork> ah
[05:53:54] <converge> is there a better way to center this window ? http://paste2.org/Mtgf3J8b
[05:53:56] <Cork> well ya then it's fine
[05:54:05] <Cork> that would basically just be like an exception anyway
[05:54:13] <Lebbe> places where, if you come there, there must be a bug some where
[05:54:24] <Cork> converge: css3 transform?
[05:54:44] <Lebbe> should perhaps do a console.log instead if any clients browsers suddenly goes into debugger mode
[05:54:50] <Cork> Lebbe: the question is if that should just silently be handled one way or another though
[05:55:20] <converge> Cork: attribute transform to center ?
[05:55:28] <Cork> no
[05:55:31] <Lebbe> I have two cases of debugger, they are places so severe that it should be fixed right away if you end up there
[05:55:37] <Cork> converge: one min
[05:56:02] <Lebbe> one is where i do some sort of save against the server, and with a switch try to figure out what kind of saver
[05:56:05] <Lebbe> save*
[05:57:00] <Cork> converge: http://jsfiddle.net/h4ozjdzL/
[05:57:27] <converge> Cork: wow, perfect ! thanks
[05:57:54] <Cork> converge: note though transform doesn't work in older ie
[05:58:02] <Cork> so you might have to have a js fallback for them
[05:58:30] <Lebbe> if you know the width of the element you can do a margin-left instead
[05:58:43] <Cork> ya
[05:58:49] <Cork> but you often don't
[05:59:03] <Lebbe> true
[05:59:10] <Lebbe> how old is old in ie?
[05:59:17] <Cork> ie9 i think
[05:59:18] <Heishiro> Hello everyone!... I'm trying to use ajax for the first time ever and need some help. I'm trying to do an autocomplete, and it works just fine, BUT if the user types 5 letters, ajax does 5 queries to the server. Is there a way to start the query once the user stops typing? My code is here... http://jsfiddle.net/Lgc8vkw0/ Thanks in advance!!!!
[05:59:18] <Lebbe> i havent seen the translate trick
[05:59:38] <Lebbe> i dont think we support ie 9
[05:59:44] <Cork> ah
[05:59:46] <Cork> interesting!
[05:59:51] <Cork> ie9 works
[05:59:55] <Cork> you just have to prefix it
[06:00:00] <Lebbe> oh
[06:00:04] <Cork> -ms-transform: translate();
[06:00:08] <Cork> didn't know that
[06:00:14] <Cork> i like that a lot
[06:00:25] <Cork> ie9 might be worth supporting i don't care about ie8
[06:00:42] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to make an ajax get request to etherpad that I have installed on my server and listening on port 9001
[06:00:49] <Lebbe> we sell an application. this aplication happens to run in the browser. but not if you use ie 9
[06:00:56] <Lebbe> i like this approach very much :P
[06:01:02] <abailarri> But browser blocks saying thaht I need CORS
[06:01:07] <Cork> Lebbe: ya, i use it a lot
[06:01:08] <abailarri> how can I enable?
[06:01:21] <Lebbe> abailarri: that have to be enabled on the server
[06:01:33] <Cork> Heishiro: i would recommend using a timer instead
[06:01:41] <abailarri> Lebbe, in my case I se apache, then I need to config apache for this¿
[06:01:52] <Cork> Heishiro: and reset the timer on each keydown and schedule a new one
[06:02:04] <Cork> Heishiro: and on say 300ms of inactivity fire the ajax
[06:02:06] <Lebbe> yes. i dont know how you do it though. #jquery is not the right channel for this i guess.
[06:02:18] <Cork> Heishiro: that is usually how rate limiting is done
[06:02:28] <Heishiro> Thanks Cork... Do you have any examples that i can read?
[06:03:14] <Cork>  var old;  on(.., func() { clearTimer(old); old = setTimeout(function() { /* code */ }, 300); });
[06:03:48] <Cork> it is really quite simple
[06:04:09] <Heishiro> OK Cork... I'll try to apply it to my code... Thanks!

[06:04:25] <Cork> Heishiro: np
[06:04:45] <Cork> Heishiro: opps a typo it is clearTimeout not clearTimer
[06:06:08] <Heishiro> OK Cork... Thanks a lot.
[06:09:14] <abailarri> Cork, I readed, but where I need to manipulate, in the requester server or in the requested server?
[06:09:34] <Cork> you typed request twice :)
[06:09:51] <Cork> it needs to be in the response header
[06:10:08] <Cork> from the server you request data from
[06:14:05] <abailarri> Cork, ok, in my case is the same server, but different port, then, same domain but different port
[06:14:19] <abailarri> Then, where is necesary to config this?
[06:14:38] <Cork> abailarri: cross domain is sectioned based on protocol://fqdn:port
[06:14:57] <Cork> if any of those aren't the same on both sides, you are doing cross domain calls
[06:16:01] <Cork> so yes, from one port to another on the same server is cross domain
[06:18:43] <abailarri> Cork, I know that is a cross domain, but my question is where I need to manipulat to allow this
[06:19:15] <Cork> abailarri: cors for get calls works by the browser sending a request to the server
[06:19:30] <Cork> it then checks if the server allows the host the request comes from
[06:19:49] <Cork> if it doesn't set a header to explicitly allow it, the browser won't hand over the response data to the site
[06:20:05] <Cork> (the page i linked you to does explain this)
[06:20:16] <abailarri> then, is necesary to config the requested server to allow cross domain requests
[06:21:09] <Cork> uh
[06:21:22] <Cork> wither no, or you use the terms weirdly
[06:21:32] <Cork> a server rarely do requests
[06:21:41] <Cork> unless you proxy or cache data for later use
[06:22:01] <Cork> wither==either
[06:23:07] <STFUn00b> hi guys... how to remove active state on 'a' element when you click on it, then move outside that element and release the mouse button.
[06:23:17] <STFUn00b> Chrome handles that well, it removes the focus
[06:23:31] <STFUn00b> but IE9 for example, leaves the focus on the element
[06:23:54] <Cork> STFUn00b: not sure you have control enough to do anything about that
[06:23:59] <STFUn00b> the problem is, my button (it's actually an 'a' element) stays pressed in
[06:24:04] <Cork> how focus works is meant to be platform dependent
[06:24:15] <decx> a clients seo agency just sent me some doubleclick codes with a bunch of global variables and document.write. Does it make sense to send them a sane rewritten version back or is that a lost cause?
[06:24:16] <Cork> though chrome normally ignores that part
[06:24:27] <STFUn00b> hm... i thought about using mouseup
[06:24:35] <STFUn00b> but mouseup doesn't get fired at all
[06:24:36] <Cork> decx: lost cause
[06:25:02] <abailarri> Cork, I'm creating a web app and throught the web I need to make an ajax call to the same server but in diferent port, then, the config I need to put in the requested part, no?
[06:25:03] <decx> that was my first thought as well -.-
[06:25:10] <Cork> doubleclick has the worst code on the market
[06:25:20] <Cork> they are renounced for it
[06:25:34] <Cork> why would they remove something that makes a vital part of there brand?
[06:25:42] <decx> renowned? ^^
[06:25:50] <Cork> :/ ya
[06:26:03] <decx> damnit
[06:26:14] <decx> "add this document write directly after the body tag"
[06:26:15] <notchris> So I have no choice, but I have to edit a super antiquated system that has no ability for customization
[06:26:19] <STFUn00b> cork thx for your help. bye!
[06:26:24] <notchris> So Iâ€™m using jquery to replace the content generated by the system
[06:26:27] <Cork> abailarri: you are messing up the terms
[06:26:48] <Cork> abailarri: the side that wants the data is sending a request
[06:26:59] <Cork> abailarri: the server then responds to it, so it sends a respond
[06:27:13] <Cork> if a server sends a request it would mean it starts the connection
[06:27:28] <Cork> and that never happens if the browser is part in the connection
[06:28:53] <abailarri> I understand, then, where is necesary config to allow cross domain?
[06:29:42] <Cork> uh
[06:29:46] <Cork> i already told you
[06:29:50] <abailarri> in script that makes the request?
[06:29:54] <Cork> it needs to be in the response header
[06:30:01] <abailarri> in response header ok
[06:30:07] <Cork> -_-'
[06:30:25] <abailarri> then, I need to manipulate the script that sends the response
[06:37:15] * Heishiro sighs
[06:45:07] <anli> Can I get the actual css rules from a link tag without using ajax?
[06:46:18] <Cork> the link rule?
[06:46:45] <anli> <link rel="stylesheet" href="foo.css">
[06:46:47] <anli> I want the contents of foo.css without fetching it, does the browser have it already?
[06:46:53] <Cork> no you can't you can access it in document.styleSheets though

[06:46:59] <b-ot> Cork: Document.styleSheets - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/styleSheets
[06:47:02] <anli> Ah
[06:47:18] <anli> Will I also get inline styles that way?
[06:47:31] <Cork> yes
[06:47:34] <anli> thx
[06:47:44] <Cork> anli: though you should be very careful modifying that object
[06:47:48] <Cork> it is very expensive
[06:48:07] <anli> You mean that I will actually affect the style directly?
[06:48:18] <Cork> yes
[06:48:28] <Cork> it will modify what rules is used in the page
[06:48:35] <Cork> and there for trigger a full page reflow
[06:48:41] <anli> yeah
[06:48:45] <anli> powerful
[06:49:02] <anli> Styles added with style="" attribute is a different story, I suppose
[06:49:16] <Cork> ya, those aren't stylesheets
[06:49:32] <Cork> that is just lose css properties on an element
[06:49:34] <anli> Can I get a list of rules that affects a certain element?
[06:49:37] <Cork> you don't have any selectors for those
[06:49:40] <anli> ok
[06:49:41] <anli> true
[06:49:56] <Cork> anli: not really
[06:50:07] <Cork> you would have to check that manually
[06:50:07] <anli> I am working right now by modifying a text document then reload browser, then modify text document etc etc
[06:50:13] <anli> I do not like the method
[06:50:25] <anli> I will need to write a css parser then
[06:50:26] <Cork> all you get is an "array" of stylesheets and in each one a list of all the selectors
[06:50:33] <Cork> and from there the rules in each selector
[06:50:36] <anli> yeah
[06:50:47] <anli> media queries will also be important
[06:50:52] <randomguy> it's more typical to check existance of classes on an object to know what styles are effecting it, no?
[06:51:12] <Cork> randomguy: ya
[06:51:23] <anli> Is there a media query for css rules that are not actually put in a media query?
[06:51:28] <anli> A top level mq
[06:51:31] <Cork> but that depends on you knowing what the class does :)
[06:51:33] <anli> ok
[06:51:41] <anli> hehe
[06:51:43] <randomguy> true
[06:51:50] <anli> -ok
[06:51:51] <Cork> anli: not really, there is .supports
[06:51:55] <anli> ok

[06:52:15] <anli> cool
[06:52:18] <Cork> but that isn't really media queries, even though it depends on the same backend
[06:52:38] <Cork> i think there is a mediaQuery too...

[06:52:46] <anli> What I actually want is a decent css editor that sits on top of a webpage
[06:52:54] <anli> Maybe a bookmarklet
[06:52:55] <Cork> hmm might be remembering wrong...
[06:53:20] <decx> look into the firefox developer edition
[06:53:39] <anli> Did not know there was one
[06:53:42] <anli> nice
[06:53:42] <Cork> decx: that isn't erally an editor
[06:53:55] <decx> it comes with one
[06:53:58] <decx> what'S it called
[06:54:00] <Cork> it is just a specially themed alpha version of firefox
[06:54:05] <anli> But it maybe was a good tip for a browser
[06:54:09] <Cork> decx: so does all firefox versions
[06:54:19] <decx> i wanted to include it in my workflow but havent had the time to adapt yet
[06:55:00] <Cork> firefox dev edition is just a rebranding (and theming) of firefox aurora (alpha version)
[06:55:18] <anli> So it does not add a lot then?
[06:55:31] <decx> WebIDE, that's what it was called
[06:55:53] <anli> I like how it is in reverse video
[06:56:12] <decx> there are also some snippets to automatically reload a page when you edit its file in an editor
[06:56:25] <anli> But I really do not want to reload the page
[06:56:28] <decx> and i think brackets has that included already
[06:56:45] <anli> But to edit css measurements live
[06:56:58] <decx> well all devtools do that
[06:57:20] <decx> i know that firebug has an option to output changed css somewhere
[06:57:21] <anli> Not visual studio, I have a text editor and I modify a css file and reload the browser
[06:57:49] <anli> I do not want to search a long list of css rules like I have to do now, using firebug
[07:00:01] <Cork> anli: i would recommend looking at stylish
[07:00:15] <decx> cork, just sent out an email with doubleclick stuff in iife and no document.write wish me luck ;)
[07:00:16] <Cork> anli: it lets you add "new" rules to the page and preview the effect
[07:00:31] <Cork> then you can just copy the changes when you like the result
[07:00:37] <anli> I have tested that, I use that to get rid of rubbish on imdb.com
[07:00:55] <Cork> it is my number one hack tool :)
[07:00:59] <anli> :)
[07:01:04] <Cork> i use it a lot to modify both sites and the firefox ui
[07:01:33] <anli> But there is a problem, first I need to identify which css rule to change
[07:01:47] <anli> Which takes awful long time, having a some thousand of lines css file
[07:01:59] <Cork> anli: just inspect the the element with ctrl+shift+i
[07:02:04] <anli> right click in the browser will give me a list of 100 lines where I can find the rule however
[07:02:07] <Cork> and the copy the selector from the right side column
[07:02:17] <Cork> should be a matter of 5-10 seconds
[07:02:18] <anli> That is also consuming a lot of time
[07:02:22] <Cork> O_o
[07:02:25] <decx> the solution is to have specialized css files that aren't 1000s of lines
[07:02:32] <anli> Thats 4.5-9.5 seconds too much
[07:02:47] <anli> That could be a solution, but not to my problem
[07:06:29] <anli> Seems I cannot use cssRules on a stylesheet from document.styleSheets: "the operation is insecure"
[07:06:35] <anli> Cross domain
[07:06:53] <Cork> heh
[07:06:55] <Cork> ya
[07:07:03] <anli> Can I turn off the security then?
[07:07:08] <crillegustafsson> hi
[07:07:21] <Cork> anli: depends on the browser, but... not a good idea
[07:07:33] <anli> It is, I do not want it, thats why :)

[07:08:46] <crillegustafsson> if I delete multiple the filter not work.. anybody knows why ? =)
[07:08:50] <Cork> anli: and that would mean a site can ajax files from your local disk
[07:09:02] <anli> Can I pick a site to disable cors security for?
[07:09:06] <Cork> no
[07:09:16] <Cork> and as far as i know only chrome has an option to disable it
[07:09:22] <anli> Oh, then I can disable it and then enable it
[07:09:25] <anli> aha
[07:09:29] <anli> ffs
[07:09:35] <Cork> --no-websecurity or something like that (a boot option)
[07:09:44] <anli> found something like chromium-browser --disable-web-security
[07:10:04] <Cork> i strongly recommend NOT to touch that one
[07:10:13] <anli> yeah, you do that ;)
[07:10:14] <crillegustafsson> here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Z6uQ2/26/

[07:12:16] <anli> I will only surf my own site
[07:12:17] <randomguy> crill: oh, my bad, i was using the datatable filter.. nvm, lets see...
[07:12:21] <crillegustafsson> randomguy... You need to delete it and then click RUN
[07:12:31] <Cork> any site that loads third party .js would be my red haring
[07:12:44] <anli> computers can be reinstalled
[07:12:45] <emx> hi. is there a function that allows me to search textnodes for a pattern? the textnodes are children of elements that are children of the same parent element.
[07:12:57] <Cork> anli: but stolen data can't be unstolen
[07:13:06] <anli> True, do you want some of the data?
[07:13:07] <anli> :)
[07:13:19] <anli> I am a bit relaxed about it (right now at least)
[07:13:58] <anli> I am allergic to security right now, it stopped me from doing what I wanted
[07:14:15] <anli> btw, I only get null from cssRules
[07:15:40] <randomguy> crille: http://jsfiddle.net/Z6uQ2/32/
[07:16:11] <randomguy> crille: ruff change.  something different between values used for multiple and not.  changing it to use $(this).val() gets you the new single value
[07:16:50] <anli> Seems like there is some security left, I got the message "font from origin foo.com" has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Policy
[07:17:14] <crillegustafsson> randomguy: that worked
[07:17:33] <PCatinean> How does one go through all the options of a select field and check that if it's active?
[07:17:47] <anli> What is an active option?
[07:17:52] <PCatinean> selected option
[07:17:53] <crillegustafsson> randomguy instead of select I want ul and for option I want li
[07:18:05] <BillCriswell> PCatinean:
[07:18:28] <anli> var option = $('select option:selected');
[07:18:29] <crillegustafsson> so it be <ul> <li> instead of <select> <option>
[07:18:31] <BillCriswell> You can do like.. $('select option:selected') I think? Might even be something shorter with serialize.
[07:18:32] <anli> I think it was like that
[07:18:41] <anli> yeah
[07:18:50] <crillegustafsson> can u please show me in fiddle?
[07:18:59] <PCatinean> anli, yes that's to pick out the selectd one, but if I loop through them and I want to check on each one if it's selected I just do that first and compare the value?
[07:19:24] <anli> Is it multi select?
[07:19:36] <PCatinean> yes
[07:19:51] <anli> var options = $('select option:selected'); then
[07:20:00] <PCatinean> ah so store in var and then compare
[07:20:10] <anli> options.each(function(){ var option = $(this); /* more crap */});
[07:20:13] <randomguy> crille: ul and li version   http://jsfiddle.net/Z6uQ2/33/
[07:20:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/durade/1/edit?html,js,output there's also this
[07:21:00] <PCatinean> how do I access the options once I have the select object by the way?
[07:21:41] <crillegustafsson> randomguy - thx! that was clever =)
[07:21:41] <randomguy> PCatinean: .children() i believe or .find('option')
[07:21:55] <PCatinean> ah find will do, thanks randomguy !
[07:23:42] <BillCriswell> PCatinean: The link I gave you would probably be a bit easier.
[07:23:53] <PCatinean> which one BillCriswell ?
[07:24:02] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/durade/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:24:38] <BillCriswell> Don't forget to click "Run with JS" button though.
[07:28:03] <crillegustafsson> randomguy ... can I have a text value inside <li> ?
[07:28:37] <crillegustafsson> like <li class="text">Hello</li>
[07:28:42] <randomguy> crille: sure
[07:28:43] <crillegustafsson> and it look for text
[07:28:53] <crillegustafsson> and not hello
[07:29:11] <randomguy> crille: in that case go with something like data-text
[07:29:27] <crillegustafsson> ok.. like $("#dbox > li > datatext").click( function ()
[07:30:11] <randomguy> crille: someone may correct me on the selector but <li data-text="Home"></li> could be accessed with $('li').data('text')
[07:30:56] <crillegustafsson> for example.. can u show in fiddle
[07:31:05] <randomguy> crille: sure one sec
[07:31:25] <crillegustafsson> thx =)
[07:31:46] <BillCriswell> PCatinean: Chances are if you're working with a form you'll want to familiarize yourself with serializeArray(), extremely useful function.

[07:53:05] <decx> what's up bill
[07:53:32] <decx> i took like a 4 month break from dev
[07:53:55] <decx> recharging those batteries
[07:55:07] <Omar-> arschmitz come one man, that was a typo. you're underestimating me ;)
[07:55:18] <Omar-> one*
[07:55:20] <Omar-> grrr

[07:55:35] <decx> i'm beginning to see a pattern here
[07:56:03] <fatmandown> it's okay. I spent twenty minutes debugging an ajax call yesterday until I realized $.ajax(function() { }) isn't a real thing
[07:56:22] <arschmitz> Omar-: are you sure im underestimating you your track record in the last half dozen messages would say otherwise :-)
[07:56:32] <decx> ohhhhhhhhhh
[07:56:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you do anything fun with the 4 months off?
[07:56:57] <decx> only design
[07:57:16] <decx> nothing interesting, print work for clients
[07:57:23] <decx> mostly just doing nothing thouigh
[07:57:24] <BillCriswell> Oh interesting.
[07:58:02] <decx> like 300 hours of catching up on games i bought over the last years ;)
[07:58:13] <randomguy> nice
[07:58:21] <BillCriswell> Haha. I couldn't imagine not coding for 4 months.
[07:58:30] <decx> working 12 month crushes my spirit
[07:58:33] <randomguy> my roommate needs to do that with all his gog games

[08:01:42] <bePolite> Hello
[08:01:57] <bePolite> Can I talk about GSOC stuff here?
[08:02:55] <arschmitz> bePolite: this is not really the place but i will get you to the right place
[08:03:04] <arschmitz> bePolite: which task would you like to help with?
[08:07:13] <bePolite> arschmitz: QUnit - Better diff output
[08:07:25] <bePolite> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364 in particular
[08:09:21] <arschmitz> bePolite: lets go to #jqueryui-dev
[08:10:11] <DEA7TH> Does jQuery Mobile support applications which allow only one aspect ratio to prevent stretching, making everything outside the page a background? Because that's what my customer wants.
[08:14:18] <BillCriswell> So you want the page to like, run in the center of the screen with nothing outside of it?
[08:15:18] <Omar-> DEA7TH this meta tag does     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
[08:16:00] <DEA7TH> BillCriswell: Yes. And if someone views it with an unusually wide screen, there will be quite a large area on the sides which is plain black.
[08:16:07] <Omar-> DEA7TH http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/pages/#Viewportmetatag
[08:16:54] <randomguy> how does viewport compare to using flexbox?
[08:17:00] <DEA7TH> Omar-: you mean with a different parameter for width and/or height? because device-width is not what I want - I want it to be independent of the device resolution
[08:17:28] <Omar-> randomguy flexbox isn't supported by all browsers
[08:17:54] <Omar-> http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox
[08:18:33] <Omar-> well, if you still want to support IE 10 and below
[08:19:51] <Omar-> DEA7TH you mean you want to fit element based on screen's width/height? to fill all space?
[08:22:04] <DEA7TH> Omar-: I want to avoid all stretching, only scaling is ok. If my app is 600x800, then it can support 60x80, but not 600x900 - if someone views it with 600x900, only 800 of the 900 will be used, the rest will be in plain black.
[08:22:41] <BillCriswell> DEA7TH: http://jsbin.com/vubika/1/edit?css,output something like this?
[08:22:43] <DEA7TH> and I just tried <meta name="viewport" content="width=300, initial-scale=1"/> - this didn't enforce any ratio.
[08:22:56] <DEA7TH> BillCriswell: exactly.
[08:24:20] <DEA7TH> I knew it can be achieved with body { background-color: #000; } but is this the conventional way? is there some more supported way to do it?
[08:25:29] <BillCriswell> DEA7TH: You want to achieve a background color in a way that isn't background color?
[08:26:15] <DEA7TH> BillCriswell: I'm checking whether there is a higher-level way because if yes, it would take care of more things for me than if I implemented it myself.
[08:28:13] <Omar-> DEA7TH jQM is responsive to any screen resolution, with or without meta viewport
[08:28:59] <Omar-> if you want a responsive app, use percentage as in BillCriswell's example
[08:29:25] <DEA7TH> was just checking if there was a more supported way to do what I'm doing
[08:29:26] <Omar-> media queries will help you too
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> DEA7TH: Not sure I'm really following. =(
[08:29:41] <robertmaxrees> I was late to the party.  DEA7TH can you explain what you're trying to do?
[08:29:44] <Omar-> DEA7TH show us what you're doing
[08:30:08] <Omar-> a simple example will help us get what you want to achieve
[08:30:12] <DEA7TH> robertmaxrees: like BillCriswell coded, this: http://jsbin.com/vubika/2/edit?html,css,js,output but.....
[08:32:39] <robertmaxrees> ... waiting
[08:33:35] <DEA7TH> (where the inside area is my application, and it has always the same aspect ratio, regardless of the device you're using to view it; the remaining part gets filled with black) however...
[08:33:35] <DEA7TH> I'm checking if what I'm doing is supported and if there is a conventional way to do it - if nobody knows of such way then I will assume there isn't a convention.
[08:33:58] <robertmaxrees> he just showed you how do to it.
[08:34:08] <DEA7TH> Got disconnected. Here is what I wrote:
[08:34:12] <robertmaxrees> it's doable, though normally you wouldn't go about it the way you're doing it.
[08:34:12] <DEA7TH> I'm checking if what I'm doing is supported and if there is a conventional way to do it - if nobody knows of such way then I will assume there isn't a convention.
[08:34:18] <DEA7TH> robertmaxrees: like BillCriswell coded, this: http://jsbin.com/vubika/2/edit?html,css,js,output but.....
[08:34:22] <robertmaxrees> we saw it before you disconnected.
[08:34:24] <DEA7TH> (where the inside area is my application, and it has always the same aspect ratio, regardless of the device you're using to view it; the remaining part gets filled with black)
[08:34:52] <DEA7TH> ah okay, if someone replied then I didn't receive the messages
[08:35:16] <robertmaxrees> i pointed out that he showed you how to do exactly what you want to do, but that you're king of going about it weird.
[08:35:23] <robertmaxrees> *king = kind

[08:55:38] <knownasilya> I'm trying to download an .xlsx file via a post, but I get a parse error, invalid xml
[08:55:47] <knownasilya> seems like the data shouldn't be read..
[08:56:16] <BinaryKitten> knownasilya you can't download via AJAX
[08:56:28] <BinaryKitten> you'll need to point the browser to the file
[08:56:38] <BinaryKitten> or create an iframe
[09:24:28] <Utils> My heads hurting over this. I'm using .find to find an h3 element: votes = $this.parent().find("h3"); but then I want to change the text of the h3 so I do votes[0].text('stuff'); and then it says "undefined is not a function". I did do console.dir(votes) and I see in dev tools the 0 index points to h3. I'm very confused.
[09:24:51] <robertmaxrees> votes.text()
[09:24:55] <robertmaxrees> no [0]
[09:25:53] <jnor> hello im a bgeinner, how can I make these 3 lines less redundant? http://pastebin.com/G1NzSZ11
[09:26:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you adding it if it already has that class?
[09:27:02] <Utils> I tried that too robertmaxrees and it sets the text value to NaN. The text value of h3 is "0" and then I do this: votes.text(parseInt(votes.text) + 1);
[09:27:11] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Utils
[09:27:11] <b-ot> Utils: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:27:59] <Utils> http://fixee.org/paste/0vfbyha/
[09:28:32] <robertmaxrees> Utils then the parseInt call is broken.
[09:28:36] <robertmaxrees> what's the value of votes.text ?
[09:28:43] <Utils> "0"
[09:29:16] <AssWagon> can anyone help me figure out how to make a custom jquery scroll bar 'feel' smoother? it seems to be not so smooth and chops down the page
[09:29:37] <robertmaxrees> you might be running into a bug here, Utils.  try parseInt(votes.text, 10) + 1
[09:30:14] <robertmaxrees> jnor http://fixee.org/paste/266d8zq/
[09:30:27] <Utils> wait I'm mistaken. It should be parseInt(votes.text()) I was playing around in the console and I noticed the inconsitency
[09:30:38] <robertmaxrees> you still need that second arg fwiw.
[09:30:38] <AssWagon> is there any "optimization" methods for something like that?
[09:30:40] <jnor> was suppose to be if not, thansk for catching that robertmaxrees
[09:30:52] <robertmaxrees> jnor you don't need to check.
[09:30:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks for you.,
[09:31:04] <daveaway> having problems with position()
[09:31:16] <daveaway> i cant make its container position relative...
[09:31:16] <jnor> Ohhhh
[09:31:24] <jnor> well... :D great thanks
[09:31:55] <AssWagon> any ideas guys
[09:32:27] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ AssWagon
[09:32:27] <b-ot> AssWagon: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:32:39] <AssWagon> www.elpasoconcretecontractor.com
[09:32:47] <AssWagon> i know you guys are goign to tell me to just ditch the scroll bar
[09:32:53] <AssWagon> but i want to make it work
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> why do you have the custom scrollbar in the first place?
[09:34:37] <daveaway> cos the normal scrollbar is ugly probably
[09:34:45] <daveaway> what's wrong with teh scroll bar?
[09:34:46] <AssWagon> just for asthetic reasons
[09:35:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're going to have perf issues with stuff like this (shrug)
[09:36:03] <AssWagon> there's no way to make it just a little smoother?
[09:36:26] <AssWagon> works smooth when the physical browser is in a smaller window
[09:36:32] <AssWagon> but full screen'd it drags
[09:37:07] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/malihu/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin/issues/139
[09:37:34] <robertmaxrees> there are a few reports about bad performance for that particular plugin it l;ooks like.
[09:38:41] <Utils> Ok robertmaxrees everything works ... sort of. However when I click two vote buttons after each other... the variables are overwritten so it will appear as if one idea has 2 votes. Is there a way to rpevent this?
[09:39:00] <robertmaxrees> ... i have no clue what your code looks like.
[09:39:05] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're expecting.
[09:39:16] <knownasilya> BinaryKitten: yeah, went the normal url route.. alternative is also to use Blob, and URL.createObjectURL and then to put it on a link and trigger a click..
[09:41:06] <Utils> robertmaxrees: I've already pasted it. Imagine I have multiple ideas on my page and users can vote for each one. I will have multiple vote buttons. When you click on a vote button, it will grab the id of the idea and find the h3 which displays the number of votes. When you click on another vote button, these variables defined prior to the $.post call are overwritten. So now, the h3 points to the last ideas h3 that I voted on. http://fi
[09:41:13] <robertmaxrees> that cut off fwiw.
[09:41:29] <Utils> where does it cut off.
[09:41:37] <robertmaxrees> the fixee link it looks like.
[09:41:44] <robertmaxrees> and i don't play the imagining game well.
[09:41:46] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[09:41:48] <Utils> http://fixee.org/paste/b90yd5q/
[09:41:52] <Utils> same as before pretty much.
[09:42:06] <robertmaxrees> btw your $this, id, and votes vars are global there.
[09:42:52] <Utils> How do I make them non-global?
[09:42:52] <robertmaxrees> you need http://fixee.org/paste/b90yd5q/#url=x02zbf2
[09:43:12] <Utils> oh, oops.
[09:43:31] <robertmaxrees> also you need to supply the second arg to parseInt() or you'll cause issues in FF.
[09:44:23] <robertmaxrees> also you can shorten if (json.errors.length > 0) { to just if (json.errors.length)
[09:44:31] <robertmaxrees> same with the success and votes lengths
[09:48:29] <Utils> Ok thanks, made those changes and now it works. I don't normally make variables global, I just forgot to stick var infront this time ha. thanks again.

[10:21:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:22:09] <Omar-> skypce should be if ( $(this).attr("aria-expanded") ) returns value of aria-expanded
[10:22:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to do === "true" or === "false" btw.
[10:22:29] <robertmaxrees> .attr() returns strings.

[10:39:17] <BillCriswell> skypce: Do you have aria-expanded="true" ?
[10:39:37] <BillCriswell> skypce: You should really be showing the HTML as well and putting it into like jsfiddle.net or soemthing.
[10:40:05] <skypce> BillCriswell, http://skypce-sandbox.com/repo/paynet-corporate-website-designs/new/business.html

[10:40:33] <skypce> i have js code for work normally the arrows then expand and collaps
[10:42:30] <BillCriswell> ok.
[10:44:17] <BillCriswell> skypce: So what are you asking exactly?
[10:44:29] <skypce> the initial state when loads page
[10:44:40] <skypce> is aria-expanded=true
[10:44:44] <skypce> the first item of menu
[10:45:05] <skypce> i need the arrow point in oposite direction
[10:45:06] <skypce> mmm
[10:45:15] <skypce> i think that i will use css for initial state
[10:47:19] <BillCriswell> Sounds good.

[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> "not being received" meaning that they're not working?
[11:49:18] <jasonPNew> robertmaxrees: yeah
[11:49:33] <robertmaxrees> all sorts of things can break that.
[11:49:46] <jasonPNew> robertmaxrees: it's like i never registered them
[11:50:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that can be caused by other code removing event bindings or binding before you and running a few different methods
[11:50:25] <jasonPNew> robertmaxrees: hmm, i know you can stop events from bubbling up, but i thought lower level nodes always get the events first. I can't think of how I'd prevent that if I wanted to
[11:50:43] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopimmediatepropagation/
[11:51:03] <jasonPNew> ahhh, i suppose the event handler registering methods could be overriden
[11:51:22] <robertmaxrees> or your code adds things after the aforementioned method is run.
[11:52:00] <jasonPNew> ok, i guess it doesn't matter how, there's no way to change it without the site changing it's code, right?
[11:52:20] <robertmaxrees> you could try using delegated listeners and seeing if those work.
[11:52:20] <jasonPNew> no way to change it *within reason*
[11:52:45] <jasonPNew> i tried doing $('body').on('click', ...) and i get nothing
[11:53:05] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', 'element', function() {}); is what i'd try, but if that doesn't work...
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> can you confirm the bindings are even there?
[11:55:24] <jasonPNew> i don't think they are
[11:55:34] <jasonPNew> probably about time to give up :)
[11:55:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> you can open your dev tools and confirm.
[11:57:49] <jasonPNew> doesn't look like it :)
[11:57:56] <robertmaxrees> then you have another issue going on.
[11:58:42] <jasonPNew> alright, there's only so much you can do on a page that doesn't belong to you i suppose
[11:58:45] <jasonPNew> thanks a lot for your help
[12:30:05] <sash_> When I register $('body').click(), all links on a page won't work anymore. How can I prevent that?
[12:30:37] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> share your code.
[12:31:42] <sash_> https://bpaste.net/show/3f915745623c
[12:32:12] <sash_> When the menu is opened I want a click anywhere on the screen to close it
[12:32:45] <sash_> But I also want the links to still be functional.
[12:33:46] <sash_> Atm, I just have the title enabled to close the menu, but imho it would be nicer that any click would trigger the slide.
[12:34:01] <sash_> The slide is from jquery-ui, but that doesn't matter.
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:34:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, return false; is probably your problem.
[12:35:05] <sash_> Oh, okay.
[12:35:11] <sash_> That could beâ€¦
[12:35:27] <sash_> I just set that everywhere to prevent some weird behaviourâ€¦
[12:35:42] <claytonzaugg> How can I make the following work?   if (this.options.height !== "100%")
[12:35:44] <robertmaxrees> that runs e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropatagion().
[12:36:28] <sash_> robertmaxrees: I should read http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/ I guess
[12:37:05] <claytonzaugg> Because no matter the case, it runs like it isn't equal to 100% always
[12:37:31] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg console.log(this.options.height); before that and see what the value it.
[12:37:47] <claytonzaugg> okay lemme try, thank you
[12:41:50] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, okay it's returning an object, not a value... how would I determine it's height?
[12:42:06] <claytonzaugg> or how would I determine if it's 100% height or not?
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> you have a .css('height') check you can use.
[12:42:49] <sash_> No, you don't want to do this.
[12:42:55] <sash_> This can be em, px, %
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> this has code smell imo.
[12:43:25] <claytonzaugg> okay thank you robertmaxrees, I'll try that and see if it works
[12:43:30] <sash_> You want to use $(selector).height()
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not what he's asking for ;)
[12:44:15] <sash_> That's what he wants, implicitly ;)
[12:44:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a bit of an assumption i'd say.
[12:44:33] <sash_> Of course.
[12:44:48] <sash_> But .css('height') can cause problems
[12:45:13] <Guddu> I posted my question earlier. Here it is again. Why does a List Item show up as Object Object instead of the text that I am getting from the server? I can now confirm that this behavior is seen only when the element in question is loaded in a JQuery modal dialog. If loaded on a normal page it works fine. WHat could be the issue?
[12:45:21] <sash_> You can check for 100% by calculating the relation of the element's height and the parent's height
[12:47:11] <sash_> ratio I meant
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> Guddu probably not setting text the way you think you are.
[12:47:33] <cjohnson> Guddu: if you're getting Object then you're passing an object, not text
[12:48:59] <Guddu> cjohnson, robertmaxrees Thanks for the response and apologies that I won't be able to create a JSFiddle for this. Server is returning exactly this
[12:48:59] <Guddu> [{"pk": "AAAA11", "match": "AAAA11 - A D Embalaje Ltda.", "value": {"transporter_name": "A D Embalaje Ltda.", "vehicle_plate_number": "AAAA11"}, "repr": "AAAA11 - A D Embalaje Ltda."}]
[12:49:45] <Guddu> I have on the page the same widget inside a div. And it works fine. Then on same page i have a button which launches a modal on the same div. And it starts showing object Object.
[12:50:44] <cjohnson> you would have to make a fiddle
[12:50:47] <Guddu> I think Jquery modal dialog adds something over and on the top. I just can't figure out what. Its been 2 days :(
[12:51:17] <Guddu> cjohnson, The server that returns the response is a Django App on my Laptop. I am not sure how I will be able to recreate this on Fiddle
[12:51:36] <Guddu> I generally try to create fiddles but with this one I am in a situation.
[12:51:44] <cjohnson> you can copy its response and mock up the part that feeds the response into whichever code you're using
[12:52:03] <Guddu> cjohnson, I will try
[12:52:03] <cjohnson> at the very least paste your code even if you can't make it work
[12:53:39] <Guddu> Here is the widget code on the normal page
[12:53:40] <Guddu> http://dpaste.com/3FEMJ4X
[12:55:23] <Guddu> And here is the code of Modal Dialog that gets generated as captured in Chrome Inspector
[12:55:23] <Guddu> http://dpaste.com/3AM5SSC
[12:56:46] <cjohnson> so your issue is with autocomplete right? if that's the case your server data is not formatted correctly for what autocomplete expects
[12:56:55] <cjohnson> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[12:57:32] <Guddu> cjohnson, Server is returning same data. The widget is same.Only when its opened in JQuery Modal it presents this problem
[12:57:35] <cjohnson> also that data-plugin-options attribute looks suspecious
[12:58:06] <cjohnson> I don't even see where a modal comes into play
[12:58:24] <cjohnson> regardless, the data that you pasted above is *definitely* not the right format for autocomplete's source
[12:58:41] <cjohnson> and your value is an object.
[12:58:55] <cjohnson> which would prob be where you're getting "Object" from
[13:15:20] <Guddu> cjohnson, If i use semanticui modal instead of jqueru dialog it works fine. But it kind of hides the select list dropdown in the background
[13:37:52] <sshaun> Anybody have a clue why a JSON object in $.ajax's `done` callback would differ from the responseText? Does the underlying JSON parser have an internal cache or something?
[13:38:58] <sshaun> Looking at the arguments in the done callback shows the proper responseText from the AJAX endpoint, but the responseJSON object does not match up
[13:42:35] <cjohnson> Guddu: your data is not formatted correctly for autocomplete, and you *still* haven't explained how modals come into play here
[13:47:39] <notchris> hey
[13:49:45] <cjohnson> is for horses
[13:50:52] <hackal> Hello, what would be the best way to target element with jquery which has attribute ' data-option-key="test" ' ?
[13:52:15] <cjohnson> $('[data-option-key=test]')
[13:52:43] <cjohnson> ideally with a tag name before that
[13:53:17] <hackal> Now I see thank you. Do you think this will work on newer browsers?
[13:53:19] <cjohnson> mind you that only searches attributes. if you change the data value using .data() the selector won't reflect that change
[13:53:27] <cjohnson> yes it should work fine on all browsers that jquery supports
[13:53:44] <hackal> cjohnson: I dont need to change the value I just need to add class to that element.
[13:55:36] <cjohnson> right I'm just saying that this won't work: http://jsfiddle.net/gwon44t9/
[13:58:54] <Emn1ty> so, I'm trying to use the draggable + sortable and was wondering if there's a simple way to make it so only my draggable items cn sorted?
[13:59:05] <Emn1ty> can*
[14:03:39] <mwdev> maybe attach a class or id to the ones you want to sort? im no expert in jquery yet tho
[14:04:07] <mwdev> and then you would specify in the jquery which ones can be sorted by those classes
[14:06:09] <Emn1ty> adding item: 'div:not(.ignore)' doesn't work :/
[14:10:26] <jonez> greetings. is there any rule that says I cannot animate() an <li> element?
[14:10:51] <mwdev> i would be more focused on making the other one searchable with a class or data attribute then putting a ignore. <div searchme> then search dom for all things that have searchme
[14:11:19] <Emn1ty> I got it working
[14:11:35] <mwdev> jonez, you can. you just need to make sure your targeting properly (basic css properties)
[14:11:35] <Emn1ty> but I can't sort at all anymore... which is odd
[14:11:43] <mwdev> what did you add it it Emn1ty
[14:11:57] <Emn1ty> well, the items in my sortable are <div>
[14:12:02] <Emn1ty> the draggables are li
[14:12:07] <Emn1ty> <li>*
[14:12:15] <Emn1ty> so I did: items: 'li'
[14:12:37] <Emn1ty> so now I can drag and drop without the other elements being sortable BUT you also can't sort the dropped items
[14:12:38] <jonez> mwdev, in this case my js is creating the element at run time. this is for a notify system
[14:12:48] <hackal> cjohnson: I see now. Looks like in my case I have the same problem. Html elements are being added by jquery .load(). What would be the best way to add class to elements created by .load()?
[14:13:24] <notchris> .addClass after load
[14:13:32] <jonez> what happens is that I don't see the animation.. the li basically pops onto the screen right away. I have some code that fades out the li when a button is clicked, and that works great.
[14:13:56] <notchris> jonez: Animate opacity and set the duration
[14:14:16] <notchris> jonez: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:14:23] <jonez> notchris, I'm setting speed to "slow"
[14:14:39] <mwdev> Emn1ty, i would personally keep them all as li's and just use data attr
[14:14:40] <notchris> Try milliseconds
[14:14:42] <Emn1ty> figured it out
[14:14:47] <Emn1ty> I think...
[14:15:01] <jonez> ok
[14:15:05] <notchris> fast = 200, slow = 600
[14:15:09] <Emn1ty> yeah, got it
[14:15:16] <Emn1ty> needed to use cancel
[14:15:25] <Emn1ty> { cancel: '.ignore' }
[14:15:29] <mwdev> ahh
[14:15:34] <Hereisanotherlie> I am trying to find an alternative to hasManyThrough for many to many relationships
[14:15:45] <notchris> jonez: Perhaps you need to trigger something upon the completion of another animation?
[14:16:05] <cjohnson> hackal: you just need to delay the code that adds the class until after the load completes
[14:16:43] <Hereisanotherlie> modal a has a many to many relationship with model b and model a has a many to many relationship with model c I would like to find out how to connect model b to model a
[14:16:52] <Hereisanotherlie> or i mean model b to model c*
[14:17:07] <Hereisanotherlie> when they both connect to model a
[14:17:44] <Hereisanotherlie> oh whoops
[14:17:48] <Hereisanotherlie> wrong channel sorry :/
[14:31:18] <s3shs> I want to list all ids of elements that have "google" in their id.  Why is this spewing all elements to the console?  $("[id^=google]").each(function() { console.log($(this).attr('id')) })
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> $('[id*="google"]') maybe?
[14:32:34] <cjohnson> s3shs: it's not: http://jsfiddle.net/ntufewgd/
[14:33:43] <s3shs> Huh.  I'm on a web page.  I inspected an element.  And I utter that jq in to the console.  And I tons of stuff that I don't want.  I want just the ids.
[14:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you sure jquery is loaded into the page?
[14:34:01] <s3shs> Is that chrome doing that?
[14:34:04] <robertmaxrees> try jQuery instead
[14:34:10] <s3shs> Yeah, I hit $ and get a function.
[14:34:22] <robertmaxrees> chrome has a $ if jquery isn't loaded ;)
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> try using jQuery instead of $ and see if that works.
[14:34:52] <s3shs> $ === jQuery -> true
[14:35:22] <robertmaxrees> it was worth a shot.
[14:35:29] <s3shs> Ok, the stuff it's spewing is a bunch of iframes.
[14:35:46] <s3shs> And it's spewing an array of iframes.  It's trying to be helpful and it's not.
[14:35:47] <s3shs> :-)
[14:38:09] <s3shs> Bak, I just locked up chrome.  It's gonna be one of those days.
[14:40:38] <jonez> I fixed my bug.. I added a call to css() to set opacity to 0.00 and the fade works great now
[14:50:44] <skypce> guys what can be the problem of this code, doesnt work fine:http://pastebin.com/ufTugVXJ
[14:51:10] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?

[14:52:04] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/pkwbcu2/ this is probably closer to what you want.
[14:52:05] <skypce> see the right block menu
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> a small, self-contained example would be best.

[14:56:44] <crillegustafsson> hi. here is my code : http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/yy2q9pga/3/
[14:56:45] <crillegustafsson> my problem: I want my tabs start with "see all" everytime I click on someone of the top tabs
[14:57:17] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson okay.  what have you tried for the JS?
[14:58:08] <crillegustafsson> none javascript.. just angularJS
[14:58:22] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees
[14:58:25] <robertmaxrees> well, the short answer is you want an event binding, crillegustafsson
[14:58:43] <crillegustafsson> yes. =) it is.. Im a bit lost how to code it
[14:58:56] <robertmaxrees> check out jquery's on() method.
[14:59:44] <robertmaxrees> you'll wind up with something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yy2q9pga/4/
[15:00:26] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees oh.. thats exacly what I ment =)

[15:25:06] <OnceMe> after some time scrolling/being on my website, jquery slows down my website, why and how to profile it with chrome dev tools?
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> the "profiles" tab
[15:27:21] <OnceMe> not timeline tab?
[15:28:59] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling
[15:29:30] <OnceMe> ok and how to see bottleneck
[15:29:35] <OnceMe> whats not normal ms time?
[15:30:08] <robertmaxrees> http://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-optimisation-with-timeline-profiles/ is another option.
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> plenty of reading out there.
[16:24:51] <skypce> i need whe aria-expanded= true

[16:31:06] <skypce> very thank you kevireilly
[16:31:08] <kevireilly> might be wrong though, I'm not really familiar with ARIA
[17:11:18] <BlaDe^> typically for elements that are entering/leaving the DOM i use $('body').on('click', '.dynamic', function(e) { ... });
[17:11:39] <BlaDe^> it appears for scrolling, that doesn't work - is there a reason why?

[21:31:08] <Nash303> I've always wondered, when I include jquery and various plugins, does the ?ver=### have any effect on the scripts at all?  ie js/jquery/ui/slider.min.js?ver=1.11.2  vs just slider.min.js
[21:34:57] <Nash303> oh, it's probably just for caching, isn't it

[23:47:48] <Unopoo> what's this code is trying to do?
[23:47:48] <Unopoo> http://jsfiddle.net/azqgt4ea/
[23:49:06] <Unopoo> and the (function(){}()) structure is rather comfusing to me
[23:49:37] <sacho_> why is it confusing?
[23:51:09] <Unopoo> (function(a){code}(A))
[23:51:09] <Unopoo> is it mean pass A as a and run code once only?
[23:53:13] <sacho_> sure
[23:54:51] <Unopoo> I'm digging hardly to this code snippets, now I seems see what it is trying to do
[23:57:45] <Unopoo> it's trying to set the clicked item to `selected` and unset other `selected` item's select status
[23:58:15] <Unopoo> such a simple functionality, why bother the complicate code, showing off
[23:59:44] <sacho_> there's nothing complicated about the code
