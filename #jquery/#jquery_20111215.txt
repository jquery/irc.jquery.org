[00:00:48] <Cork> poppiez: you don't need to null it
[00:01:01] <Cork> its a local variable it will be gc'ed when your done
[00:01:02] <poppiez> Cork: yes, otherwise onload might fire twice in some cases
[00:01:11] <Cork> uh... no
[00:01:17] <poppiez> yes, check the last line
[00:01:36] <poppiez> don't think the gc'er is that fast
[00:01:42] <Cork> why do you want to trigger the event if the load failed?
[00:02:16] <poppiez> Cork: what do you mean? reason why I'm doing the last line is because some browsers don't fire the onload event if the image is cached
[00:02:26] <Cork> img.complete shouldn't be a consern if you bind the event before you set the src
[00:05:24] <Cork> poppiez: an example http://jsbin.com/ideqan/edit
[00:05:29] <Cork> it will trigger every time
[00:08:09] <poppiez> Cork: right, okay. I've been benchmarking a bit. it seems like my method of firing onload() manually if 'complete' is true is faster for cached images. anyway, thx a lot. I've learned a lot after your feedback
[00:08:44] <Spadeski> Cork Strikes Again!
[00:09:41] <poppiez> Cork: this is my proposed solution: http://pastie.org/private/zlfzaxyzwxhvn9ak9elvnw
[00:10:44] <Cork> uh.. if you don't want to know when its loaded... don't use onload -_-'
[00:11:09] <Cork> the reason you get faster effect through .completed is cause the image isn't loaded yet
[00:11:28] <Cork> the network socet is closed thats more or less all you know
[00:11:43] <Cork> *complete
[00:12:25] <poppiez> Cork: I can see a delay north of 100ms for images already cached if I don't check for the 'complete' prop
[00:12:56] <Cork> might be, and if thats the case it prob means it loaded the image from disk cache
[00:13:06] <poppiez> yeah, I think you're right
[00:13:17] <Cork> the load event is triggered when the image is ready to be used
[00:13:25] <Cork> its a big difference
[00:13:58] <poppiez> Cork: it's actually inserted instantly but the onload event has this small delay
[00:14:02] <poppiez> but I get your point
[00:14:04] <Cork> ontop of that, if your doing this in a loop
[00:14:18] <Cork> the onload events won't trigger until all your image element has been created
[00:14:27] <poppiez> I am but it's only two images at a time :)
[00:14:27] <Cork> as events can't intercept a loop
[00:14:55] <poppiez> well, it's not actually a loop. I'm running through the array and only proceeding when the image has loaded
[00:15:16] <Cork> running through it with what?
[00:15:21] <Cork> setTimeout?
[00:15:33] <Cork> onload callbacks?
[00:15:41] <poppiez> Cork: no I have a function that calls itself when each image has loaded and then removes from the array until it's empty
[00:15:51] <Cork> ah
[00:16:00] <Cork> so onload callbacks then :)
[00:16:08] <poppiez> right
[00:16:43] <Cork> well if your ok with not garanteeing the dimentions are correct, your solution should be ok
[00:17:48] <Cork> garantee as in the actual image dimantion differing from the stored dimention informaiton
[00:18:19] <poppiez> Cork: true, there might be a race condition there but I'm ok with that
[00:19:00] <Cork> no not race
[00:19:33] <Cork> until the image is loaded, the browser gives you the dimention the image had last time it was loaded, that can change if the image has been updated
[00:19:50] <poppiez> ah
[00:19:51] <poppiez> right
[00:20:00] <poppiez> that's no problem though. they never change
[00:20:19] <Cork> it can actually be to the extent that your getting the image of an old cached image, while a new one will be fetched from the server
[00:22:00] <poppiez> Cork: good observation
[00:22:18] <Cork> na, just old experience
[00:22:24] <poppiez> hehe :D
[00:22:36] <Cork> i used to fiddle with things like this a long time a go with slow connections
[00:22:44] <Cork> things where much simpler to se back then :)
[00:39:19] <ajaxbud> Hi guys, I have two different div ids of two textboxes which dynamically generate an li tag with same id  (when something is entered in to the textbox). I need to access the li tag to extract the entered values and build an array out of them. Right now I use the $(#tagname).each and  store the values.While constructing the array it concatenates the values entered in both the textboxes.this is
[00:39:20] <ajaxbud> not the intended behavior..I want the arrays to hold texts from respective textboxes
[00:40:52] <ajaxbud> anybody there?
[00:42:51] <ajaxbud> hey guys..
[00:43:07] <ajaxbud> could someone address this issue please?
[00:43:18] <Zogot_> Get a working example
[00:45:05] <ajaxbud> its huge..
[00:48:50] <ajaxbud> hello guys.. anybody out there?
[00:56:58] <ajaxbud> bad timing
[00:57:00] <ajaxbud> guess
[01:00:07] <Xotix> Hi, im using datatables. While it renders the table it addes some html. It  does this in the ready(). I know want to access that added html by a class, but i can't since when my $(class) get called, the table hadn't added this html yet. How can i check if it has finished rendering?
[01:10:48] <ajaxbud> Xotix we are abandoned :(
[01:11:22] <sente> Xotix: can I see an example?
[01:13:10] <Xotix> i got it
[01:14:00] <Xotix> but thanks :)
[01:28:16] <dov23> Hi, is there a way I can do something liks $('#hello*')….
[01:28:30] <dov23> and wildcard match all ids starting with hello ?
[01:28:44] <Xotix> i have a table. This is updateable via ajax by calling customerTable.fnReloadAjax(). In the table a have an icon. If you click on this icon, a laye pops up loading the edit view via an iframe. Is it possible to call the update function within this iframe so it affects its "parent" page?
[01:34:34] <edgardo> dov23, you can. To get all id elements starting with hello: $('[id^=hello]') ... to get all id elements ending with hello: $('[id$=hello]')
[01:35:11] <qawsedrf> how do i convert an obj into json ?
[01:35:50] <qawsedrf> well, an array not an obj
[01:38:17] <AdvoWork> if ive got a function that is checking for errors and will return true or false if found, is it best doing function main_fun() { if(check_for_errors() == false) { //carry on } ?
[01:38:44] <dov23> edgardo: what if my ids are all hello_1, hello_2, etc., and I want to do something with the number value.  Is there a way to grab the number part easily?
[01:41:54] <noaXess> hey all
[01:42:05] <noaXess> scrollTo isn't a jquery main function, right?
[01:42:16] <noaXess> is there a way to scroll to a element?
[01:42:48] <Cork> [0].scrollTop
[01:42:58] <Cork> its a dom propert
[01:43:09] <noaXess> hey Cork... so [0] is the element?
[01:43:13] <Cork> oh wait to :)
[01:43:36] <Cork> noaXess: scrollTo doesn't exist at all as far as i know
[01:43:40] <Cork> you need a plugin for that
[01:43:54] <Cork> thought you asked about scrollTop ;)
[01:44:09] <edgardo> dov23, you _could_ add a data-attribute to each element
[01:44:19] <Cork> ?g jquery scrollTo @ noaXess
[01:44:21] <bot-t> noaXess, jQuery.ScrollTo - http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[01:44:34] <dov23> edgardo: is there an example you can point me to?
[01:44:55] <edgardo> dov23, just a sec.. will jsfiddle
[01:45:55] <noaXess> Cork: and with scrollTop() i can't scroll to/teh element?
[01:49:22] <edgardo> dov23, http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/vpafk/
[01:50:32] <AdvoWork> does jquery have a better way than doing: var field1 = $('field1').val(); var field2 = ... and so on? ive got about 20 fields
[01:50:36] <edgardo> data-attributes can be added to any element, and can be named whatever.. as long as it starts with data-
[01:51:35] <edgardo> AdvoWork, if they are named the same I guess you could do an .each and insert them into an array?
[01:52:22] <edgardo> how to do it I don't know, but that's just what popped into my mind first :)
[01:53:19] <AdvoWork> edgardo, all different names :s ie description, price, value, quantity etc etc
[01:55:09] <ximarin> Hi all, what is wrong with this selector? $("tr[class^=detailsFor_]").hide();
[01:55:20] <edgardo> are going to validate them or just send them through somewhere?
[01:56:11] <ximarin> it is not applied to tr's with classes like detailsFor_1, detailsFor_2
[01:56:13] <edgardo> remove the tr?
[01:57:28] <edgardo> we just talked about this a while ago too. :) --> <edgardo> dov23, you can. To get all id elements starting with hello: $('[id^=hello]') ... to get all id elements ending with hello: $('[id$=hello]')
[01:57:32] <AdvoWork> edgardo, i need to validate each one, so gather the data, make sure some contain stuff(ie mandatory) and then pass it somewhere after that
[01:57:44] <AdvoWork> things like, if this field is filled in, then this other field should be etc
[01:58:14] <ximarin> edgardo: hmm, still does not work
[01:58:32] <EdwardIII> hey
[01:58:56] <ximarin> maybe the error is somewhere else, I used this selector hundreds of times before, thats what confuses me...
[01:59:23] <edgardo> what does the console say?
[01:59:51] <EdwardIII> i've got a lib here that says it's accepts themeing, i'd like to hijack that to trigger a function on every image change, but i can't figure out how to get the theme variable inside the lib? https://github.com/buildinternet/supersized/blob/master/slideshow/js/supersized.3.2.6.js
[02:00:04] <ximarin> erm, I'm stupid... I had a condition set that wasn't hit...
[02:00:16] <edgardo> AdvoWork, if they are to be related like that then you really should keep then apart and do each one by one, I guess
[02:00:25] <edgardo> if you have to cross-check/validate them
[02:01:10] <EdwardIII> i've tried defining this, but no luck: $j.themes.beforeAnimation(function(){ console.log("before animation") });
[02:01:54] <EdwardIII> that's based on what i saw here: http://keith-wood.name/themes.html
[02:06:38] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/wxzSX5gn take a look at line 19 and it's function and the onClosed. Is this okay? Creating a dataTables object for calling the function or is it somehow bad?
[02:16:03] <codeho> morning
[02:17:30] <dov23> edgardo: thanks a lot… one more question… how do I get my 'nephew'?  I have an <a> element as a sibling of a <div> in which I have an <input>  How do I get the <input> from the <a> ?
[02:19:27] <edgardo> I think children() would be the way to go
[02:19:55] <edgardo> or find()
[02:20:33] <Stooge> how to call a function that resizes some object and hides some parts of the object as well and it is executed from execute on load?
[02:20:33] <bot-t> (62 hours 30 mins ago) <Hopsy> tell Stooge to came back
[02:21:49] <jqrd> hi
[02:22:12] <jqrd> anyone having trouble with trigger() not passing the custome event data to the handlers?
[02:22:19] <jqrd> *custom
[02:22:28] <Stooge> ignore my question
[02:22:47] <jqrd> this is what i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/HN7q3/13/
[02:24:11] <noaXess> Cork: ave you ever used scrollTo()?
[02:25:40] <Cork> noaXess: sure
[02:26:25] <noaXess> Cork: i'm inside a div with id content_1 and have a link with onclick="$('#content_1').scrollTo(50,500)"... but doesn't scroll anything
[02:26:56] <noaXess> myabe i missunderstand something :]
[02:27:52] <kuya> hi, im tring to post some data to a service with a content-type of text/html, but as soon as i set that content type in the ajax request it immediatly returns without actually doing any requests. if i set the content type to anything else it does do the request... any ideas?
[02:28:05] <kuya> $.ajax('http://html5.validator.nu/', {data:'<html></html>', processData: false, type: 'POST', contentType: 'text/html', converters: {}}).error(console.error)
[02:28:08] <kuya> for example
[02:28:35] <AdvoWork> I've got: <dd><button type="button" name="add_product" id="add_product" >Add Product</button></dd> And $(document).ready(function(){ $('#add_product').click( function(){  alert("here1"); });  but it never alerts here1. Any ideas please?
[02:30:52] <guy> how do I filter element by data()? entries.filter(function(){ $(this).data().id == activeElement.id })
[02:30:56] <guy> is that the right way?
[02:35:14] <noaXess> Cork: it seems that scrollTo maybe only works with jq 1.3.x and not 1.4+
[02:38:11] <AdvoWork> argh, what else could cause a button, and .click to not work, if firebug isnt show any errors what so ever?
[02:38:26] <Cork> noaXess: your sure?
[02:38:36] <noaXess> Cork: not really.. hm.. testing it.
[02:39:32] <alex88> i can ask for jqueryui too?
[02:40:19] <pr06z3r> Excuse me, if I've selected an element using something like '#question > ul > li' and am implementing a .click function on (them). How can I access that particular element's child of type say 'ul'.
[02:40:51] <crab> pr06z3r: .children('ul')
[02:40:54] <crab> alex88: sure
[02:41:08] <pr06z3r> Perfect, Thank you crab
[02:42:11] <alex88> i've a datepicker, which format for example dd MM yy with custom month names, php script uses different format and it wouldn't parse it, is possible to get the current datepicker date in another format?
[02:44:00] <crab> alex88: $.datepicker.formatDate('some format', elem.datepicker('getDate'))
[02:44:14] <crab> where elem is the element you have attached your datepicker to.
[02:44:52] <noaXess> Cork: ok, my test case says.... it works with 1.4+ .. so another issue ;)
[02:44:54] <noaXess> human one ;)
[02:45:51] <Cork> interesting...
[02:46:10] <alex88> crab: oh, great! thank you
[02:46:23] <Pallet> Hi all
[02:46:51] <crab> you're welcome.
[02:48:40] <zfstephen> jQuery isn't a moon! It's a space station!
[02:49:18] <Cork> noaXess: where are you testing this?
[02:49:23] <Cork> 1.7.1 works fine here
[02:49:24] <Gavrisimo> anyone knows how to get jparallax 0.9.9 (webdev.stephband.info/parallax.html) to work in jquery 1.7.1? or maybe someone can suggest some other parralax plugin?
[02:49:31] <EdwardIII> hrm chaps, any idea how i can inject my function into line 524? i can't figure out where the object theme comes from
[02:49:35] <EdwardIII> https://github.com/buildinternet/supersized/blob/master/slideshow/js/supersized.3.2.6.js
[02:49:37] <noaXess> Cork: in the moment with 1.4.2...
[02:50:04] <Cork> noaXess: i meant where
[02:50:08] <Cork> and on what server?
[02:50:18] <Cork> and==as
[02:50:23] <noaXess> Cork: local machine

[02:51:58] <Pallet> I know I've got my syntax wrong, but can someone point me in the right direction of 	jQuery('#boilerplate').fadeIn('200').idle(2000).fadeOut('200');
[02:52:01] <Xotix> i have a <a href> and i want a confirm() on it. If it is true, it should link to the href specified. Is there a easy way for this? Don't want to get the clicked href and so on. Isnt there something?
[02:53:02] <poppiez> any info on how to do mousewheel zooming in the origin?
[02:53:25] <poppiez> (like gmaps)
[02:53:52] <EdwardIII> Xotix: well you can use $('.widget').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); /* Your confirmation box here */ })
[02:54:15] <Cork> Xotix: $('a').click(function(event) { if(!confirm('your sure')) { event.preventDefault(); } });
[02:54:42] <Xotix> ah
[02:54:43] <Xotix> thanks
[02:55:01] <EdwardIII> Cork: you got any idea on this jquery theme obj. thing?
[02:55:08] <EdwardIII> you aboslute jQuery hacker
[02:55:17] <Cork> obj thing?
[02:55:27] * Cork scrolls up
[02:55:58] <EdwardIII> Cork: "any idea how i can inject my function into line 524? i can't figure out where the object theme comes from: https://github.com/buildinternet/supersized/blob/master/slideshow/js/supersized.3.2.6.js"
[02:56:19] <Xotix> works like a charm thanks! i should read more about js's event stuff
[02:56:49] <noaXess> Cork: thx.. don't know why it won't work in my case.. hm... maybe ajax problem.. cause the content where the scroll button/script is in, will be showed as ajax response.. but all ohter, fancybox, gallery, and and and works fine..
[02:56:52] <Cork> EdwardIII: best is prob to copy the base.netSlide function and overide it in an extending script
[02:57:38] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrmm... but it looks like the ability to extend it is already there within the theme obj?
[02:57:57] <EdwardIII> Cork: or am i missing the point?
[02:58:25] <Cork> heh, looks like i need to read the code a bit more :)
[02:59:43] <noaXess> i'm inside differents div's.. can that be a problem with scrollTo?
[03:00:11] <noaXess> cause there is wrapper, heder, navigation, content, footer.. insode content i need to scroll to a specific position..
[03:00:17] <noaXess> shouldn't be a probem, right?
[03:00:20] <noaXess> problem
[03:00:29] <Cork> EdwardIII: ugg, looks like it looks for a global variable (window.theme = { beforeAnimate: function() {} }
[03:01:55] <noaXess> lunch time.. bbs..
[03:02:51] <RLa> anyone experienced highslide and jquery conflict, seems like the both use $ variable?
[03:04:06] <Xotix> jquery.conflict()?
[03:06:24] <Zauberfisch> Xotix isn't it noConflict?
[03:06:58] <Zauberfisch> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:06:59] <Xotix> Zauberfisch: probably he will find iit anyway
[03:09:00] <vmasto> hello guys, quick question: With the $.delegate() and $.on() methods, does the container element need to be existent upon page load? Because I'm trying to delegate an event on a container that gets inserted into the DOM with Ajax and the event delegation just doesn't work.
[03:14:12] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrm, how did you spot that?
[03:14:33] <bLUEE> hi there. i am using jquery.tmpl to add extra form fields, and jquery.validate to form. but my dynamically added fields dont seem to get validated ?
[03:15:31] <bLUEE> any ideas ?
[03:18:18] <EdwardIII> Cork: tried adding this to the page but no show: window.theme = { beforeAnimate: function() { console.log('before animate...'); } };

[03:40:39] <AdvoWork> if im doing $('#price_break_price_' + count).val()  how can i remove all non-numeric characters?
[03:42:01] <edgardo> AdvoWork, do you have an input field which should only contain numbers?
[03:44:01] <AdvoWork> edgardo, its a field thats going to conrtain a character also, such as £123 or $123 but the first char could be anything, so i want to remove everything thats not a number
[03:44:28] <AdvoWork> my value is in $('#price_break_price_' + count).val()  and i could do myString.replace(/\D/g,"")  but wondering if there is a better way?
[03:44:48] <edgardo> ok.. I just thought about <input type="number"> which only takes numbers
[03:45:00] <xec> AdvoWork: i was about to suggest the .replace() ;)
[03:45:01] <edgardo> but if you need to include £ then it won't work
[03:46:22] <xec> ?eval "$17.00".replace(/[^0-9.]/g,"")
[03:46:24] <AdvoWork> edgardo, it only shows the £ etc to the user so they know what currency to enter the value in, but when im passing it to a DB i need to remove all non-numerics
[03:46:26] <bot-t> xec: "17.00"
[03:47:16] <edgardo> I hate regex ;)
[03:47:32] <EdwardIII> i like it
[03:47:35] <EdwardIII> when used appropriately
[03:47:50] <edgardo> I mean.. I bet it can be handy once you get your grip around it.. but man it looks and feels so hard
[03:47:59] <xec> kinky
[03:47:59] <edgardo> given it a go a few times
[03:48:04] <edgardo> always had to ask for help hehe
[03:48:12] <EdwardIII> yes it's got a bit of a tendency to be write-only
[03:49:25] <risky_s> hi
[03:49:28] <risky_s> html related question
[03:49:49] <risky_s> how do I get a url parameter using a hidden field
[03:50:49] <risky_s> I am currently doing <input type="hidden" id="name" value="<?php $_GET['name']" ?>" />
[03:50:55] <AdvoWork> so is "$17.00".replace(/[^0-9.]/g,"") the best way to do it?
[03:51:46] <edgardo> risky_s, shouldn't you value="<? echo $_GET['name']; ?>" ?
[03:52:02] <edgardo> or rather<?php in the beginning.. not <?
[03:52:22] <risky_s> thanks working now
[03:52:42] <edgardo> np
[03:54:09] <RLa> AdvoWork, what if user enters 17.00.00.00?
[03:54:17] <RLa> AdvoWork, is that valid input?
[03:55:22] <RLa> also, how can you ignore currency symbol, $17.00 does not have exactly same value as £17.00
[03:57:15] <edgardo> can't the currency be placed in a dropdown menu before/after the input field for the numbers?
[03:57:29] <edgardo> so that it isn't in the input field at all
[03:57:37] <djcoin> Damn, i have an html template in some var, say: tmpl
[03:57:45] <djcoin> $('#my_id', tmpl)
[03:57:49] <djcoin> Should work no ?
[03:58:01] <djcoin> if its contained in the tmpl, that is not part of the dom yet
[03:59:55] <aslant> I'm trying to use jquery to copy xml nodes from one xml document "Doc1" into another xml doc, "Doc2". I can use clone() on xml nodes from Doc1 which is great. However in IE6/IE7 I get errors inserting the clones into Doc2. Is this because the cloned nodes belong to Doc1???
[04:00:11] <aslant> If so, how do I clone a node from Doc1, and insert it into Doc2?
[04:01:34] <poppiez> how can I scale a div in its origin using the mousewheel?
[04:01:40] <djcoin> Can someone help me ? im in a hurry :|
[04:02:09] <RLa> aslant, how are you constructing those documents?
[04:02:44] <RLa> djcoin, create fragment from that template
[04:02:52] <aslant> RLa: from strings using parseXM()L. (Also I should have mentioned that I'm using jquery 1.6.1)
[04:02:53] <djcoin> RLa: I have a String
[04:03:06] <aslant> s/parseXM()L/parseXML()
[04:03:07] <djcoin> Isn't it enought ?
[04:03:37] <RLa> $('<div/>').html(tmpl). <- constructs fragment from tmpl
[04:03:51] <djcoin> RLa: great, thanks
[04:04:05] <djcoin> Hope I could use a string directly
[04:04:22] <RLa> if that's valid html it will work
[04:04:40] <amirite> hurrying makes bad programming
[04:04:41] <James13433> Why ie why!
[04:04:58] <RLa> amirite, tell that to the client
[04:07:09] <aslant> RLa: I can't do something like clonedXmlNode.ownerDocument = Doc2 it seems
[04:07:37] <aslant> which is not surprising as you can't do that with any C Xml libs that I know
[04:07:42] <RLa> aslant, a quick hack would be to serialize dom and deserialize in other doc
[04:08:15] <speyburn> u guys know any good and free programs / sites to test crossbrowser support?
[04:09:01] <RLa> install virtualbox and windows with different ie versions
[04:09:02] <aslant> RLa: I can deserialize with js / jq?
[04:09:09] <RLa> that's how we do it here
[04:09:13] <aslant> speyburn: what RLa said. Definitely the way to go
[04:11:24] <RLa> aslant, seems to be not so easy
[04:11:55] <RLa> aslant, another solution would be to make copy of dom with the context of other doc
[04:12:03] <aslant> RLa: Ouch!
[04:12:35] <aslant> RLa: Actually I've misunderstood I think
[04:12:45] <RLa> with a recursive walker
[04:13:12] <RLa> i.e copy elements and other nodes using createElement function of the other doc
[04:13:39] <James13433> Any one any idea how to debug somecode, thats not working in ie8 and below?
[04:13:45] <James13433> that has no error in firebug
[04:14:06] <aslant> James13433: I take it you don't have Visual Studio?
[04:14:37] <James13433> no I dont aslant
[04:15:20] <aslant> James13433: you'll find various plugins proposed on StackOverflow.com but Visual Studio is the only option I've found that is close to satisfactory
[04:16:58] <pr06z3r> James13433 you could begin with the Developer Tools (F12) in IE8?
[04:17:13] <Spadeski> sup everyone
[04:17:43] <Spadeski>  sup pr06z3r like the name
[04:18:14] <James13433> Ok, ill do that pr06z3r, just have to work out how to downgrade my ie9 first..
[04:18:16] <James13433> thanks
[04:18:32] <pr06z3r> IE8/9 have document modes
[04:19:02] <pr06z3r> You can 'simulate' IE9 to IE7 in IE9
[04:19:12] <aslant> James13433: If you've got a retail version of windows xp you can install virtualbox and have a virtual machine for each version of IE6/7/8
[04:19:57] <aslant> but still, without a console debugging is not going to be at all easy
[04:20:00] <James13433> pr06z3r how do I do that simulate thing?
[04:20:13] <pr06z3r> Visit the page you want to debug. Press F12. Change the 'Browser Mode' to IE8 and 'Document Mode' to 'Internet explorer 8 standards' (etc).
[04:20:29] <pr06z3r> This will reload the page and treat it as if you're using the older browser
[04:20:50] <pr06z3r> It's got a console
[04:20:57] <pr06z3r> You can set breakpoints, watch variables etc.
[04:21:04] <RLa> btw, why test with ie8 when page works in ie7 and ie8?
[04:21:09] <RLa> ie9*
[04:21:27] <James13433> pr06z3r, I know the code causing the issue I just have no idea why as it works fine in jsfiddle
[04:24:34] <James13433> solved allready, that was easy :)
[04:31:55] <ximarin> question: I'm triggering two events and after these, I want to set focus on a specific field. the triggers work fine, but the focus is not working. I try to focus an input that is made visible by the second trigger. why does the focus not work in this case?
[04:35:03] <soee> hi, how can i access lets say 5th image inside div?
[04:35:55] <Spadeski>  soee example ?
[04:35:56] <Stooge> soee (div>img).eq(5) mhm something like that :/
[04:36:04] <Stooge> or eq (4)*
[04:36:15] <Spadeski> stooge Wow I didnt even know that lol
[04:36:15] <soee> ok ill try
[04:36:35] <Stooge> i am not checking it online may not work but its something like that..
[04:39:19] <logicrises> does any1 know how to make draggable work simular to how the iphone scroll works.
[04:49:56] <Pallet> hi all
[04:52:15] <Pallet> can anyone point me in the right direction on how to acheive the way the "feedback & support" tab slides out on the right hand side
[04:52:19] <Pallet> at http://failblog.org/
[04:53:04] <winterdj> is it possible to turn off a bound event to a delegated event binding on a single item?
[04:53:41] <winterdj> $('ul').on('click', 'li', function() {}); and I then want to remove a click event for just one li item
[04:53:49] <Eviltwin> Pallet: I don't see any sliding here
[04:54:09] <Eviltwin> winterdj: $('#specificli').click(false);
[04:54:14] <Eviltwin> Will work
[04:54:33] <Pallet> Eviltwin, on the right, there's a "feedback & support" tab
[04:55:06] <Pallet> and it slides in the outside
[04:55:09] <Eviltwin> Pallet: Yeah, I see it, and if I mouseover it or click it, there's no "sliding"
[04:55:21] <Eviltwin> You mean the fact that it's fixed on the side bar like that?
[04:55:27] <poppiez> how can I scale a div in its origin using the mousewheel?
[04:55:36] <Pallet> yeh, I'm mean slide in at page load
[04:55:58] <Eviltwin> Pallet: That's actually CSS
[04:56:01] <Eviltwin> position: fixed;
[04:56:04] <Pallet> ok
[04:56:11] <Pallet> no
[04:56:19] <Pallet> when toy load the page,
[04:56:28] <Pallet> the tab slides in
[04:56:43] <Eviltwin> Didn't for me
[04:56:55] <Pallet> ah ok
[04:57:51] <Pallet> Eviltwin, http://uservoice.com/
[04:57:55] <Pallet> bottom right
[04:58:13] <Pallet> does the Feedback & Support button rise up
[04:58:13] <Pallet> ?
[04:58:29] <Eviltwin> Pallet: That was not the site you linkde me
[04:58:59] <Pallet> no, that was a different site with the same tab on it
[04:59:04] <Eviltwin> But say that that tab is 25px high
[04:59:17] <Eviltwin> What you would do is have CSS position: fixed with bottom: -25px
[04:59:41] <Eviltwin> Then $("#feedback").animate({bottom:0},"normal");
[04:59:50] <Pallet> ah ok
[04:59:55] <Eviltwin> ?.animate @ Pallet
[04:59:56] <bot-t> Pallet, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[04:59:56] <Pallet> it's the animate bit
[05:00:14] <Pallet> Thanks, that'll be enough for me to be getting on with
[05:02:35] <Eviltwin> You can use animate on any numeric CSS property and a few other things as well like scrollTop etc.
[05:03:07] <Pallet> Eviltwin, the reason I asked is that we have a product, thats similar http://www.purchaseseal.com/staticseal.php
[05:03:21] <Eviltwin> Cool
[05:03:27] <Pallet> and i'd like the to make the side tab slide in
[05:07:26] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[05:07:32] <Pallet> Eviltwin, thanks dude
[05:07:33] <Pallet> http://www.purchaseseal.com/staticseal.php
[05:07:39] <Pallet> have a look at the page again
[05:08:37] <mathi> hi!
[05:08:56] <gyzmodo> I've a link "Show popup" and hidden div with class popup how can i show this div.popup by clicking link "Show popup"
[05:08:57] <mathi> how do I know which is the last element in an each() loop?
[05:08:57] <gyzmodo> :)
[05:10:19] <Pallet> gyzmodo, jQuery("#showpopuplink").click(function() {jQuery(".popup").fadeIn(500);
[05:10:45] <mathi> anyone
[05:11:01] <Pallet> gyzmodo, jQuery("#showpopuplink").click(function() {jQuery(".popup").fadeIn(500);}); even
[05:11:26] <Eviltwin> mathi: var last; $(".foo").each(function() { ...; last = this; }); last.css("color","red");
[05:12:52] <Eviltwin> mathi: Or perhaps var c = $(".foo"); c.each(function(i) { if(i+1) == c.length) { ... } else { ... } });
[05:14:52] <Eviltwin> Or if you're really just trying to do something to the last element in a preexisting collection
[05:14:57] <Eviltwin> $(".foo:last")...
[05:15:05] <Eviltwin> Or $(".foo").last()
[05:15:10] <Eviltwin> Or var c = $(".foo"); c.last()
[05:19:37] <mathi> thank you
[05:19:43] <mathi> :)
[05:19:49] <gyzmodo> Pallet, it doesnt work for me
[05:22:35] <gyzmodo> Pallet, look here http://jsfiddle.net/eTyNT/1/
[05:22:49] <minna> how do i run a function on success when using .ajax?
[05:23:15] <Cork> $.ajax({ success: function() {}});
[05:23:27] <minna> Cork: Outside of the ajax call?
[05:23:29] <Cork> yay netsplit
[05:23:39] <minna> looks more like a netbomb :)
[05:24:22] <minna> Cork: If i wan't to run the function outside of the ajax call?
[05:24:39] <poppiez> how can I scale a div in its origin using the mousewheel?
[05:24:53] <Cork> minna: what do you mean?
[05:25:36] <Cork> poppiez: you could try using zoom  in ie and transform scale in other browsers
[05:25:43] <Cork> and bind it to the mouseweel event
[05:26:21] <minna> Cork: i have myfunction = function () {.ajax call}; and then the function i wan't to run when ajax have success. runthisonsuccess()
[05:26:33] <edgardo> gyzmodo, you have # in the id of the element in the html code
[05:26:41] <edgardo> remove that and you'll be laughing
[05:26:46] <poppiez> Cork: thx :)
[05:26:57] <Cork> minna: $.ajax({ success: runthisonsuccess }) ?
[05:27:28] <minna> Cork: I tried that, hm, maybe im missing something.. brb
[05:27:46] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps $.ajax({..., success: function(data) { runthisonsuccess(data.foo,data.bar); }});
[05:27:47] <Cork> minna: remember to NOT include the () when you give it your function
[05:27:51] <Eviltwin> Depending on what you're trying to send to the function
[05:28:10] <minna> Cork: oh?
[05:28:22] <Cork> ya, if you want special parameters you need to anonymus wrap the function
[05:28:35] <Cork> minna: ya you want to give your function as a reference, not the return from it :)
[05:28:49] <minna> Cork: Oh, yes, of course :)
[05:29:00] <gyzmodo> edgardo
[05:29:01] <gyzmodo> thanks
[05:29:02] <gyzmodo> hahaha
[05:30:14] <gyzmodo> oops
[05:30:20] <frenocha> how would I trigger a function on window close? unload() seems to trigger on any type of page change
[05:30:24] <gyzmodo> anyways
[05:30:46] <gyzmodo> edgardo, it doesnt help
[05:31:10] <Cork> ?.beforeunload
[05:31:12] <bot-t> Cork, .unload() - Bind an event handler to the "unload" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[05:31:25] <Cork> ?mdc beforeunload @ frenocha
[05:31:31] <bot-t> frenocha, beforeunload - MDN - The beforeunload event is specific to Internet Explorer. It is fired before a resource is removed from the environment (unlike unload , which is fired afterward). https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_event_reference/beforeunload
[05:31:32] <Cork> sigh...
[05:31:39] <Cork> man its slow...
[05:32:15] <Cork> ie only...
[05:32:18] <Cork> wtf...
[05:32:29] <frenocha> like anyone uses anything else
[05:32:32] <frenocha> isn't it 1997? ;)
[05:32:35] <edgardo> why do you write out jQuery instead of putting a dollar sign btw?
[05:32:40] <Cork> lol
[05:32:56] <Cork> i was sure it wasn't ie only... >_>
[05:33:14] <edgardo> gyzmodo, you have to change to jquery and on dom ready to the left also :)
[05:33:22] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, it's not
[05:33:29] <Cork> ya, i see that XD
[05:33:31] <blackspotwiggins> works for chrome/firefox too afaik
[05:33:53] <Cork> mdc might be out of date...
[05:35:00] <frenocha> Cork: I need just close though, not submit/new link/refresh/et cetera
[05:35:18] <Cork> frenocha: there is no way to make that destinktion
[05:35:34] <Cork> frenocha: you would have to validate that your self
[05:35:46] <frenocha> if(event.clientY < 0) is suggested on stackoverflow somewhere
[05:35:53] <frenocha> but it seems a bit hack'y, to say the least :)
[05:36:10] <Cork> that won't even always work
[05:36:23] <Cork> frenocha: best is to just set the exceptions you want to work
[05:37:04] <gyzmodo> edgardo, when script in the head tag, script doesnt work, why?
[05:37:49] <Cork> frenocha: you can for example bind a generic submit handler that check the action section to see if its a different domain
[05:38:04] <Cork> and set a global varialbe if it is/isn't
[05:38:44] <jmaister> Hi! Will $(selector).children also list nested children, e.g. td in a table?
[05:39:09] <Cork> and then do a simple $(window).bind('beforeunload', function() { if(!glob_var) { return false } });
[05:39:13] <Cork> frenocha: ^
[05:39:20] <Cork> jmaister: no
[05:39:40] <Cork> if your looking for elements anywhere inside the selector you want .find
[05:39:46] <xh> hi! i am trying to append a '<style>' tag to every frame in a frameset by doing `myFrame.$('head').append($('<style .....'));`but this gives an error, what is the correct way?
[05:39:53] <jmaister> Cork: Right. Thanks
[05:40:21] <Cork> xh: $('head', myFrame.document).append(
[05:40:38] <edgardo> gyzmodo, you have to wrap it in $(document).ready( function() { ----your code here---- });
[05:40:53] <xh> Cork: great! thanks a ton!
[05:40:58] <Cork> np
[05:44:05] <jmaister> Cork: Do you know how the list of tds is organized? if i perform $('#mytable').find('td') is there a logic to how the results are sorted (e.g. column by column, left to right)?
[05:44:56] <Cork> jmaister: sure its in dom order
[05:45:15] <Cork> index(0) is the first td in the table
[05:45:21] <Cork> index(1) is next and so on
[05:45:24] <minna> Cork: I must be missunderstandting something here.. Is it because of my namespaces that this does not work? http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/edit#javascript,html
[05:46:14] <MorpheusXNL> goodafternoon all
[05:46:23] <Cork> minna: wrong scoping
[05:46:37] <Cork> minna: onSuccess is local to removeThenAdd
[05:46:48] <MorpheusXNL> i was wondering if someone could help me on a matter which i can't find out on google
[05:47:02] <Cork> minna: you should prob pass onSuccess as a parameter to myAjaxCall instead
[05:47:19] <minna> Cork: How do i do that?
[05:47:33] <edgardo> MorpheusXNL, we cannot tell if we can help or not if you don't ask your question :)
[05:47:40] <Cork> myAjaxcall = function(dataJson, callback) {}
[05:47:46] <Cork> minna: ^
[05:47:53] <MorpheusXNL> i use jquery to calculate remaining browser height when loading the page. but now i wish that it would recalculate when certain divs or windows changes.
[05:47:59] <Cork> and just pass the function as the second parameter
[05:48:10] <MorpheusXNL> now i have tried to use to resize function but it is not working
[05:48:37] <MorpheusXNL> now i have read that resize only work on window. so how should i go into this matter to make that work
[05:48:50] <Cork> minna: http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/2/edit
[05:49:17] <Cork> minna: btw you need to have () after onFailure too
[05:49:25] <Cork> else its not a function call
[05:49:46] <MorpheusXNL> edgardo, do you maybe have a suggestion
[05:50:12] <minna> Cork: Hm. I think i need to read up a lot on callbacks.
[05:50:18] <frenocha> Cork: sorry for my lack of response, but I just realised I have an actual job I need to attend
[05:50:23] <frenocha> Cork: will be back later, thanks for your help! :)
[05:50:24] <MorpheusXNL> for example i have a dive that grows when the menu expands so i tried it with that so if that changes it would recalculate heights but it doesn
[05:50:31] <Farooq> hi
[05:50:51] <minna> Cork: Thanks for helping me grasp this :)
[05:50:59] <Cork> minna: its farly simple function som(callback) {}; som(function() {}); is the same as function() { var callback = function() }
[05:51:19] <Cork> you just move the declaration out to the caller of the function
[05:51:25] <Cork> its simple
[05:52:26] <MorpheusXNL> edgardo, for example what i do is $("#menu").resize(function(){ recalcheight()})
[05:52:43] <edgardo> never done anything like that, sry
[05:53:03] <MorpheusXNL> anyone else that can help me out
[05:53:32] <minna> Cork: Ah, of course!! Now it makes sense! :-) Gah, i really need to read more JS books.
[05:54:02] <MorpheusXNL> Cork, can you help me maybe
[05:54:29] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: whats the question?
[05:54:59] <sone> Hello, anyone user jsrender ?
[05:55:06] <gyzmodo> edgardo, thanks
[05:55:07] <MorpheusXNL> well i have a function that calculates the remaining size of my browser windows which works perfectly. now i want to fire this function when a certain div grows or shrinks
[05:55:30] <Cork> ah, thats tricky
[05:55:32] <blackspotwiggins> MorpheusXNL, use css for that
[05:55:37] <MorpheusXNL> cork, so i thought $("menu").resize(function(){ recalcheight() });
[05:55:41] <MorpheusXNL> but that is not working at all
[05:55:49] <Cork> ya, but they don't have a resize event
[05:56:11] <Cork> for example why ui dialogs fire resize events is cause the js for the dialog fakes them
[05:56:25] <Cork> normaly only the main window has them
[05:56:35] <MorpheusXNL> aha i see. well do you know of a way to do it becausei i  have been searching on google for days now
[05:56:57] <sone> hello, I want to render 1 or more data using jsrender, but if I use {{each}} the 1 won't be rendered, can someone help me ?
[05:57:05] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: only way is to track when something changes the size of the div
[05:57:06] <MorpheusXNL> is there a jquery function that detects a size change of a div so i can trigger my function?
[05:57:12] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: that is track those functions
[05:57:26] <Cork> and track the resize of the main window if that affects it
[05:57:35] <Cork> theres no other way
[05:57:55] <AdvoWork> if i have an array called testtypes, how can i loop through that? I'm trying $.each(test_types,function( intIndex, objValue ){alert("PT TEST:" + objValue);}); but it wont alert anything
[05:58:03] <MorpheusXNL> i can use the resize function on the window when the user changes itś browser size.
[05:58:17] <Cork> exactly
[05:58:48] <Xotix> jquery tabs. Can i specify the tabes wherevery i want or need they some kind of html structure?
[05:58:54] <MorpheusXNL> but then i need a second one which tracks the divs size how do i go about that
[05:59:00] <Cork> AdvoWork: is testtypes and test_types a typo?
[05:59:11] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: you can't
[05:59:23] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: the events there only exists if js creates them
[06:00:14] <MorpheusXNL> so i should track an onclick event on the menu and let it recalc then.
[06:00:33] <AdvoWork> Cork, test_types is the correct one
[06:00:36] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: if the click causes the resize. ya
[06:00:44] <Cork> AdvoWork_ so its a typo
[06:00:50] <Guest68220> hi @ all
[06:01:08] <MorpheusXNL> because in my case when you click an item in the menu it will expand. of course i don't know if it would cause a scrollbar on the right but that doesn matter as long as it always recalcs. i am going to try that
[06:01:11] <Cork> AdvoWork: no that should work
[06:01:11] <AdvoWork> Cork, i mean, my example there where im using test_types is correct
[06:01:24] <AdvoWork> hmm, i wonder why its not
[06:01:28] <Guest68220> someone here, willing to hel me ?
[06:01:28] <minna> Cork: There's still something i don't understand, if i try doing at like in you'r change i get success() is not a function.
[06:01:38] <Guest68220> help*
[06:01:48] <Cork> AdvoWork: if what you copied is correct you use two different variable names

[06:03:17] <Guest68220> okay so here's my problem
[06:03:37] <sone> hmm nobody use jsrender ? what template are you using guys ?
[06:04:10] <Guest68220> i am working on a Jquery Dropdown... the content comes via Ajax out of my database... works fine this far, but the animation of the sub menu lacks one attribute to work fine
[06:04:22] <Guest68220> I want to add the mouseout function
[06:04:25] <Guest68220> to slideUp
[06:04:43] <Guest68220> but mouseout for the parent and the sub at the same time
[06:04:46] <MorpheusXNL> Cork, if i would like to save a height from a certain div for comparison reasons later on in the click event is that possible. As in letś say containerheight =30 menu getś clicked and then i want to compare that height with the new height
[06:04:47] <Zogot_> ? .hover()
[06:04:48] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:05:00] <Guest68220> how should I do that
[06:05:54] <Guest68220> my final selector looks like this : $("#sub_"+parent+",#"parent).mouseleave(function() {
[06:06:03] <Guest68220> but its only triggered by the parent link
[06:07:09] <Guest68220> i tried &&, AND, ("#sub_"+parent).add("#"+parent) and nothing works
[06:07:17] <Guest68220> do you guys have an idea ?
[06:08:16] <MorpheusXNL> Cork you still here?
[06:08:54] <Cork> MorpheusXNL: yes
[06:08:56] <quicksilver> Guest68220: comma is right. Your variables or IDs must be wrong.
[06:09:10] <MorpheusXNL> Cork, did you see my question
[06:09:10] <MorpheusXNL> ?
[06:10:15] <MorpheusXNL> Cork, if i would like to save a height from a certain div for comparison reasons later on in the click event is that possible. As in letś say containerheight =30 menu getś clicked and then i want to compare that height with the new height
[06:11:04] <Xotix> does jquery tabs need some html structure or can the elements be wherevery they want?
[06:12:37] <XMan2012> how to fillup 2 input field values at the same time...
[06:13:09] <Xotix> $(#input1, #input2).val(xxx); probably
[06:13:29] <XMan2012> thanks
[06:13:45] <MorpheusXNL> anyone has got any idea how to keep data stored in a var for use in a later possible event where this value will get changed?
[06:13:53] <XMan2012> will it be realtime
[06:13:54] <XMan2012> ?
[06:14:11] <MorpheusXNL> XMan2012, are you refering to my question
[06:14:27] <XMan2012> nooo
[06:14:39] <MorpheusXNL> XMan2012, sorry
[06:14:41] <jimmysparkle> I'm creating a jquery plugin. inside my plugin I have a function called configureMasks, when I run it for some reason this becomes DomWindow rather than the element I'm expecting...
[06:14:52] <AdvoWork> Cork, this is what im trying to do http://pastebin.com/xYqAzVdJ  the alert works and alerts my values, but when I alert on line 12, its empty, any ideas?is it not setting the array for some reason
[06:15:21] <Xotix> Cookies or html5 local storage. maybe js got some public thing, im not a pro. XMan2012 just try it. But if you click a button and apply this code both should change instantly
[06:15:45] <XMan2012> i tried it but it doesnt work
[06:15:46] <XMan2012>  $('#buyername', '#name').val();
[06:16:22] <XMan2012> i am writing value of name but it wouldnt come up on the buyername field
[06:17:03] <XMan2012> a kind of autofill
[06:18:23] <AdvoWork> hmm, doing printing_types['id'][printing_type_count] = $(this).attr('id'); works fine as i do: alert("test:"+printing_types['id'][printing_type_count]);  but as soon as Im out of the each function, its blank. Any suggestions?
[06:18:56] <Raverix> Might be a scope issue.
[06:19:13] <Raverix> The value of printing_type_count isn't kept local to your function.
[06:19:21] <Raverix> As a result, it changes with a for loop?
[06:19:41] <Raverix> Obviously, these are just guesses without seeing more of your code.
[06:20:00] <Raverix> But, 'if it works here', and 'not here' - then scope seems to be an obvious culprit.
[06:20:21] <AdvoWork> Raverix, thats my small code example http://pastebin.com/Cf2Sasz4
[06:20:27] <Xotix> XMan2012: http://jsbin.com/elumak
[06:20:47] <Xotix> ur selector is wrong sry, put both in one ''
[06:20:58] <XMan2012> yes....
[06:21:07] <XMan2012> but i dont want to click on do it button
[06:21:13] <XMan2012> it should be automatically
[06:21:20] <XMan2012> without clicking on a button
[06:21:49] <Raverix> What happens when you alert the array?
[06:22:34] <XMan2012> for example... i need to know the calculation of 3 + 2 without clicking anything and another field will get 5 automatically
[06:22:51] <Xotix> XMan2012:  its an example. it always the same jsut edit it to your needs
[06:23:47] <AdvoWork> Raverix, do you mean  alert(printing_types);// DOESNT WORK  if so, its blank
[06:24:08] <XMan2012> maybe... it would be great to use unfocus
[06:24:28] <XMan2012> when user fillup 2 another field get 2 automatcially
[06:24:35] <XMan2012> without any action
[06:25:38] <Xotix> make a function call it on each key down or something. google it, there must be plenty of exmaples.
[06:25:52] <JackJones> hi all, i had a little problem with my json and autocompler
[06:25:52] <JackJones> http://pastebin.com/njRtrL8x
[06:26:02] <JackJones> how i have to parse my json file ?
[06:26:59] <astropirate> JackJones, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[06:27:19] <RLa> you do not parse jsonp
[06:27:25] <RLa> you execute it
[06:27:37] <AdvoWork> Raverix, any suggestions?
[06:27:51] <JackJones> stropirate: thank you, yes i found already to this site, but somewhere i have a little mistake
[06:27:56] <JackJones> but i can't find it
[06:28:54] <astropirate> RLa, say what?
[06:29:06] <JackJones> maybe some one this it
[06:30:14] <astropirate> JackJones, sorry can't help, i need to see it running to be able to debug it
[06:30:22] <astropirate> jsfiddle maybe
[06:30:55] <RLa> JackJones, are you using json or jsonp?
[06:31:20] <JackJones> json
[06:31:38] <RLa> then why are you requesting jsonp from jquery
[06:31:58] <JackJones> i change it from jsonp to json, and i receive now in my autocompleter "undefined, undefined"
[06:33:17] <AdvoWork> RLa, any suggestions about this, its a scope issue but I dont see how because the array is defined outside of the each function http://pastebin.com/Cf2Sasz4  when i alert on line 12, its blank.. but the other alerts have the information..
[06:34:35] <RLa> alert(printing_types); <- this gives undefined?
[06:35:32] <AdvoWork> RLa, alert(printing_types);// DOESNT WORK  just shows as blank, so a blank alert window
[06:36:28] <RLa> that is funny
[06:36:52] <RLa> what if you use alert('This is something: ' + printing_types)
[06:39:11] <winterdj> how can I remove all events bound to an item? even if delegated with on() ?
[06:42:50] <minna> Cork: I still cannot get it to work.. http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/3/edit I have read a lot on this topic, but the alert just doesn't show, and i get "success(); is not a function"..
[06:48:22] <AdvoWork> RLa, it says This is something:   and thats it
[06:49:03] <JackJones> to problem seems be the array: http://pastebin.com/DQ3A9cQ7
[06:50:19] <minna> Ah, i think you missunderstood me.
[06:50:40] <minna> or not
[06:51:03] <JackJones> sometimes, i would jump out of the window if i have to debug js !
[06:51:03] <JackJones> arg
[06:51:55] <Azrael_-> hi
[06:52:13] <Azrael_-> i hide a div like this: $("#ClassificationAndMeasures").animate({ height: 'hide' }, 500);   how can i lateron determine wether it is visible or not?
[06:52:41] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: you can't alert objects (printing_types is an object)
[06:53:05] <quicksilver> well worse than that, it's an array and you're storing stuff in it as if it was a plain object.
[06:53:28] <quicksilver> try alerting printing_types['id'][0]
[06:53:53] <minna> I'm trying to show the alert on success, but something is wrong: http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/4/edit
[06:55:09] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, if thats the case, why wouldnt my next each work? when im trying to do: http://pastebin.com/TY5DMDFQ
[06:55:20] <AdvoWork> it never alerts line 18 at all
[06:56:02] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: because you're not using printing_types as an array
[06:56:06] <quicksilver> as an array it has 0 elements
[06:56:09] <quicksilver> so the each does nothing.
[06:56:31] <quicksilver> call $.each on printing_types['id'] instead
[06:56:39] <quicksilver> since you *are* using that as an array.
[07:01:39] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, well spotted thankyou
[07:02:40] <Webpoacher> hi guys, i have a performance related question; does it hurt to call $(function() { do stuff } ); at several places in the code? E.g. would performance be better if I avoid this?
[07:03:49] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: welcome.
[07:04:00] <quicksilver> Webpoacher: not significantly.
[07:05:41] <Webpoacher> quicksilver: okay, that saves me some investigation. Second question :) We are trying to boost performance on jquerymobile. We see for example that the Event.click method takes about 650milliseconds when we click on an item (in chrome profiler). Any clue why that takes so much time?
[07:06:06] <minna> Can anyone help me? I'm stuck: I'm trying to show the alert on success, but something is wrong: http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/4/edit
[07:08:55] <Webpoacher> minna: putting () after a method name means invoking the function
[07:09:10] <Webpoacher> if you leave out the (), it means a reference to that function
[07:09:33] <Webpoacher> i guess your snippet goes wrong in that area
[07:11:07] <minna> Webpoacher: If i do that, the alert never executes.
[07:13:21] <Webpoacher> minna: did you validate if your json file is correct itself?
[07:14:09] <minna> Webpoacher: If you mean if there is a "success", yes there is.
[07:14:20] <minna> Webpoacher: This is how i have it now. http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/5/edit
[07:15:50] <Webpoacher> well, the .ajax function in fetching a json file
[07:16:08] <Webpoacher> mine failed because my json file itself contained incorrect characters
[07:17:03] <minna> Webpoacher: The json is not the issue here, even if i request custom json string, the alert wont run
[07:17:17] <minna> Webpoacher: cork mentioned something that the scope was wrong
[07:17:53] <quicksilver> minna: you haven't pasted enough code to understand and you also haven't said what actually happens.
[07:18:04] <quicksilver> therefore it is impossible for anyone to help you.
[07:18:26] <Cork> minna: sorry had to go for a whle
[07:18:28] <Cork> *while
[07:18:40] <Cork> minna: where are you stuck at now?
[07:18:44] <Webpoacher> minna: try http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/5
[07:18:56] <Cork> *what
[07:19:30] <AdvoWork> if i need to send multiple values to a php file(most are single fields, but there are some arrays, how would I send both single fields an arrays to a php file? i can use post() to send them, but not sure how, normally id do: data : { new_record: new_record, table: table, column_name: column_name },  but each of those are invidivual variables
[07:19:31] <Cork> minna: as i said you can't call a function without () after them
[07:19:39] <quicksilver> Webpoacher: that's definitely wrong.
[07:19:50] <Cork> minna: callback; won't execute the function
[07:19:56] <Cork> it needs to be callback()
[07:20:23] <Cork> or callback.call(this); if you want to set the this variable
[07:20:47] <minna> Cork: What i wan't is the alert to execute.
[07:21:05] <minna> Cork: not to run a function on the ajax success:
[07:21:06] <Cork> minna: replace callback; with callback();
[07:21:09] <Cork> and try again
[07:21:33] <minna> Cork: On the ajax success: parameter?
[07:21:55] <Cork> minna: http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/6/edit
[07:22:18] <Cork> that should execute the function your passing; that calls the alert
[07:22:45] <Webpoacher> Cork: question from my side: I am trying to boost performance on jquerymobile. I see for example that the Event.click method takes about 650milliseconds when we click on an item (in chrome profiler). Any clue why that bit takes so much time?
[07:23:47] <minna> Cork: Yes, now i get the alert, the problem was that i was running the same function again, and then i get "callback is not a function". Am i required to supply the function parameter for the obj.myAjaxcall function?
[07:24:40] <Cork> yes, or you need to define the function in the global scope
[07:25:09] <minna> Cork: Ok, that makes sense. Thanks again :-)
[07:25:32] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/ezaxex/7/edit
[07:25:36] <Cork> alternative 2
[07:26:27] <minna> Cork: Nice, thank you!
[07:26:46] <Cork> np
[07:28:37] <AdvoWork> im im passing variables to an array, theres no reason why I cant do the same with an array is there? ie  myfunc(var1,var2,array, var3) ?
[07:31:13] <minna> Cork: Can i set an empty function for callback so i don't have to call it?
[07:32:00] <AdvoWork> I've basically got 22 variables (some are single variables, some are arrays, that I need to pass to a function called myfunc(), would i still do them one by one? ie myfunc(var1,var2,var3,array1,var4,array2.....?

[07:34:03] <Alfie> I need to know if there is a way to actually make tabs(); and the scrollbar thingy to work after the load(), any idea?
[07:34:30] <Alfie> wth
[07:34:44] <Alfie> so
[07:34:47] <Alfie> any ideas anyone?
[07:34:56] <Xotix> Why doesnt it?
[07:35:14] <Alfie> Xotix ? ._.
[07:37:00] <Xotix> Whats your problem? and whats the scrollbar thingy?
[07:39:36] <davetarmac> I'm trying to create a little debug output for some thing I'm working on with parallax and need to update a value in a div. I'm doing something wrong, but can't figure it out… My line is: Scroll position: <script>document.write($(window).scrollTop());</script>
[07:40:18] <McBoingBo> sorry for the noob question but I am looking for some code that will clean ALL microsoft code on a paste, any help is much appreciated
[07:40:57] <Eviltwin> What?
[07:41:02] <Eviltwin> "clean ALL microsoft code"
[07:41:04] <Eviltwin> WTF does that mean?
[07:41:22] <PrgmrBill> presumably he means the markup that comes with pasting from MS word
[07:41:34] <PrgmrBill> it's often a problem for WYSIWYG interfaces like tinyMCE
[07:41:56] <Webpoacher> quick question: i have a multipage document, the first time I visit a page, it takes like 3 seconds on my iphone 3g, the second time it takes only 1 second. Is there a way I can speed this up?
[07:41:57] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: Don't use document.write...ever
[07:42:11] <davetarmac> I remember that's how it was done "back in the day"
[07:42:13] <Eviltwin> Webpoacher: That's because your device is caching it
[07:42:14] <astropirate> Webpoacher, yes, many
[07:42:23] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: It was never actually the right way to do it
[07:42:26] <astropirate> lrmmr hry you link
[07:42:29] <astropirate> *lemme
[07:42:36] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: no?
[07:42:42] <davetarmac> well shut my mouth
[07:42:45] <AdvoWork> I've basically got 22 variables (some are single variables, some are arrays, that I need to pass to a function called myfunc(), would i still do them one by one? ie myfunc(var1,var2,var3,array1,var4,array2.....?
[07:42:53] <Eviltwin> Webpoacher: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[07:42:56] <davetarmac> what is the correct way to do it?
[07:43:20] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: If you're trying to pass 22 vars to a function, you're doing it wrong.
[07:43:35] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: Why don't you explain what you're trying to do
[07:43:40] <Webpoacher> Eviltwin: Are these caching principles relevant when the application is wrapped in a phonegap project? (e.g. there is no webserver communication?)
[07:43:45] <astropirate> Eviltwin++
[07:43:50] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, why though? i have 22 elements on the page, i need to add these to a database, why is this wrong?
[07:44:12] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: I'm building a one page site that is going to have parallax so bits and bobs are floating up and down inside different sections
[07:44:17] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Why don't you show us some of the relevant code
[07:44:50] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: unfortunately, Some of it isn't working and without knowing that the position from the top of the page is, I can't do the maths correctly
[07:44:54] <astropirate> davetarmac, yes they are very relivent, as phonegap is only a browser widget wrapping for your web application that provides hooks into the system
[07:45:34] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: I don't understand how document.write comes into this?
[07:45:50] <davetarmac> so what I am trying to achieve is have a div in a fixed position at the top of my page to spit out the value of $(window).scrollTop()
[07:46:16] <davetarmac> so I was tying to document.write() it in to position
[07:46:17] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, i dont get why the code would make any difference? there are 22 elements on the page, a mixture of text inputs, text areas, and list menus, that i've then passed to variables. So i now have 22 variables that have exactly the data I need to add to a table(some are single values, some of the variables are now arrays, so now i need to insert the records)..
[07:46:24] <davetarmac> Hence: Scroll position: <script>document.write($(window).scrollTop());</script>
[07:46:34] <quicksilver> davetarmac: this is not what document.write does.
[07:46:35] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready(function(){$("#mydiv").text($(window).scrollTop())});
[07:46:41] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: functions that take 22 arguments are generally considered to be wildly unmaintainble
[07:46:56] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: you should make the function take a single argument of an options object, or something
[07:46:58] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: This is why I'm asking for code
[07:47:09] <quicksilver> davetarmac: put a div in your document in the normal way. Position it using CSS. update it to contain the value of scrollTop using .text() like Eviltwin just showed.
[07:47:15] <ajpiano> 22 arguments is not even borderline insane, it's way past the threshold
[07:47:29] <davetarmac> just giving that a go now :)
[07:47:36] <Eviltwin> I'd say 6 is going on crazy
[07:47:37] <Spadeski1> Sup everyone
[07:47:40] <Eviltwin> And going past that...
[07:49:17] <davetarmac> hmm - no joy
[07:49:18] <appel> Hello. I'm having difficulty applying stuff to generated html.   I render some html using: $('#mydiv').html(contents);  and then afterwards do: $('#mydiv ul li').focus(function() { alert("works"); });   but it's not getting applied
[07:49:25] <appel> however, if I wait for a couple of seconds then it works
[07:49:37] <appel> is there a way to check if it's ready in the dom?
[07:50:39] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Do you know what .focus does?

[07:54:20] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Solution: Variable scope
[07:54:29] <Eviltwin> Instead of passing all of those in
[07:54:36] <Eviltwin> Simply refer to test1, test2, test3, and test4
[07:54:37] <ajpiano> and um, don't use an array as an object

[07:57:33] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: there is all sorts of trickery you can do with arguments instead of literally stating that a function has 22 arguments
[07:57:37] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/2/
[07:57:47] <ajpiano> you  can either iterate over the 'arguments' as an array, or pass in an options object
[07:58:00] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: Do you mean you want it to continuously update?
[07:58:06] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: I do
[07:58:21] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: So A: There's no way in hell that can be done with document.write
[07:58:32] <Eviltwin> B: You need to retrigger that code with every scroll
[07:58:36] <Eviltwin> So we're going to use a scroll event listener
[07:58:49] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you need to learn a bit more about JavaScript
[07:58:54] <davetarmac> $(window).scroll(function(e)
[07:59:02] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, i know my exmaple didnt show this, but what if they are 2 seperate functions, ie http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/3/
[07:59:17] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, got an example of what you mean?
[07:59:20] <davetarmac> yup - that works :)
[07:59:25] <Eviltwin> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/kxQM8/1/
[07:59:27] <davetarmac> thanks for the help
[07:59:32] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: have you ever used jquery ui
[07:59:38] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Use console.log or something else
[07:59:41] <Eviltwin> I'm tired of all of these alerts
[07:59:47] <ajpiano> or actually, have you even used $.ajax() ? AdvoWork
[08:00:32] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, yeah, for some bits and pieces as im using to migrate to jquery if you get me
[08:00:36] <vovvawrk> how can i do this: $(this).parent().children('.class').children('class2')..html('foobar');
[08:00:56] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, ive commented out all alerts http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/4/
[08:01:11] <crab> it's too bad jquery-ui has so many combinations (as in the jquery-ui builder) that the google cdn can't host some cut-down variants.
[08:01:16] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: you know how instead of doing $.ajax("url.php", "get", {data: "something"}, false, function() { }, function() { }, "json")
[08:01:23] <ajpiano> you pass an object and the parameters are named
[08:01:36] <davetarmac> Eviltwin: I do need to learn more about it to be hoenst, it's on my list of things wot I need to do betta
[08:01:39] <ajpiano> $.ajax({url: "foo.php", success: function() {}), etc ?
[08:01:46] <ajpiano> tha's "using an options object"
[08:02:05] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: i don't have time right now to explain other techniques in more detail at the moment, sorry
[08:03:09] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/5/
[08:04:15] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, the example that Eviltwin did http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/5/  is that what you mean?
[08:04:35] <Eviltwin> Not exactly the same
[08:05:07] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, can that printing types be put into the cluster also, or would that normally be seperate?
[08:05:50] <XMan2012> my code is not working .... i am just passing value from one input field to another http://jsfiddle.net/YHMnB/
[08:05:50] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: He probably wanted more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/6/
[08:05:58] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: It totally depends on what you're trying to do
[08:06:04] <Eviltwin> What you need to learn about is data structures
[08:06:08] <XMan2012> want to make something autofill
[08:06:33] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Uu9Nw/41/ how can i apply the function to each value in the list ?
[08:06:36] <XMan2012> if somenow will write something on the first input .. so another will get it automatically
[08:06:48] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: The reason functions accept more than one argument is because it doesn't always make sense group data together into an object like that
[08:07:11] <Eviltwin> But it also doesn't make sense to send everything individually either
[08:07:21] <Eviltwin> Especially if you might have a dynamic or very large number of things to send
[08:07:39] <AdvoWork> so how would you know/decide how to do that? if ive got a mixture of single element(input text fields), text areas, and arrays of selected items?
[08:07:57] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: This isn't even close to syntactically correct
[08:08:10] <black_warlock> =(
[08:08:21] <barbagallo> =X
[08:08:24] <Eviltwin> You've got mismatched brackets all over the place
[08:08:25] <Eviltwin> Try again
[08:08:32] <black_warlock> i must insert the function under the comment
[08:08:38] <Eviltwin> And hit the TidyUp button at the top
[08:08:41] <black_warlock> inside the loop
[08:08:48] <barbagallo> black_warlock: put it through a linter to fix your syntax
[08:09:13] <XMan2012> my code is not working .... i am just passing value from one input field to another http://jsfiddle.net/YHMnB/
[08:09:31] <alex88> hi guys, i'm using http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and i've a column with dates in another format, so it doesn't work due parsing, in docs it says "Support secondary "hidden" sorting (e.g., maintain alphabetical sort when sorting on other criteria)" means i can add an attr for example with the timestamp so it sort by that?
[08:09:40] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: First, why are you going and selecting all of these right away?
[08:09:46] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: And not selecting them when you need them
[08:09:58] <black_warlock> i forgot some )
[08:10:40] <barbagallo> black_warlock: http://www.jslint.com/ -- works wonders. :)
[08:10:49] <XMan2012> how can i pass one input value to another input field
[08:10:50] <XMan2012> ?
[08:11:06] <black_warlock> keypress
[08:11:08] <Eviltwin> XMan2012: You mean copy the value of one input into another?
[08:11:15] <XMan2012> yes
[08:11:16] <XMan2012> yes
[08:11:28] <Eviltwin> $("#dest").val($("#source").val());
[08:11:42] <XMan2012> let me try
[08:11:49] <XMan2012> but i think it did but it was working
[08:12:43] <XMan2012> nope
[08:12:46] <Spadeski1>  Eviltwin you busy ?
[08:12:48] <XMan2012> it doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/YHMnB/2/
[08:12:58] <Eviltwin> Spadeski1: Currently helping about 12 different people
[08:13:03] <Eviltwin> I guess 13 can't be much worse
[08:13:18] <alex88> lol
[08:13:34] <Spadeski1> Eviltwin dont need help but you can tell me how http://75.241.124.254/Gotactics/ Looks so far
[08:13:45] <XMan2012> Eviltwin: Sorry if you are very busy
[08:14:22] <Spadeski1> XMan2012:  What do you want this too do ?
[08:14:25] * EdwardIII looks
[08:14:30] <black_warlock> set it onkeypress
[08:14:42] <EdwardIII> hey this is nothing to do with the anchient oriental game of go!
[08:15:12] <XMan2012> i want to copy the one input value into another input value
[08:15:22] <Spadeski1> ah XMan2012 use .text()
[08:15:29] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/Uu9Nw/44/
[08:15:37] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, this is what im thinking of doing: http://pastebin.com/bWLbXx2v   basically i have loads of elements on the page, ALL must be filled in(so ive got various bits of error checking) but after that, I need to add that item to the system. Any comments?
[08:16:05] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: That looks better
[08:16:15] <risky_s> hi anyone used Google Line Chart API?
[08:16:25] <Eviltwin> Spadeski1: Are you using Firebug or something?
[08:16:30] <Spadeski1> See I didnt even know that was a game when i made htis
[08:16:51] <Spadeski1>  Eviltwin Notepad++
[08:16:56] <Spadeski1> no external tools
[08:16:57] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, it looks better anyway and makes a little more sense to me..
[08:17:09] <Eviltwin> Spadeski1: Okay, use your browser
[08:17:16] <Eviltwin> If it's Firefox, get Firebug
[08:17:21] <black_warlock> XMan2012: http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/YHMnB/7/
[08:17:23] <Eviltwin> If it's Safari or Chrome, use Developer Tools
[08:17:48] <Spadeski1> alright
[08:17:49] <black_warlock> you have to use the ids not the names of inputs
[08:17:53] <Spadeski1> Any other suggestiosn ?
[08:17:56] <XMan2012> yess
[08:18:13] <XMan2012> Eviltwin: thanks
[08:18:39] <black_warlock> wtf ?_?
[08:18:44] <Eviltwin> Spadeski1: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:18:54] <Eviltwin> you have some errors. It'll help you find them
[08:19:06] <Spadeski1> Eviltwin :)
[08:19:41] <Spadeski1> Eviltwin only errors I see are the ones inside Coremorrir and other third parties
[08:19:45] <black_warlock> XMan2012 : WTF i wrote your fiddle -.-
[08:19:47] <Spadeski1> Codemirror
[08:20:33] <XMan2012> )
[08:20:34] <XMan2012> :)
[08:20:40] <black_warlock> -.-'
[08:22:21] <AdvoWork> if ive got records in printing_types['id']  and records in printing_types['names']  is there a way I can loop through those and somehow merge to one thing, so i can go printing_types[0]['id'] and printing_types[0]['names'] so i know that both records are for the first item and so forht?
[08:23:15] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: see ?cik
[08:23:16] <bot-t> AdvoWork, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[08:23:33] <Eviltwin> I'm having a lot of trouble understanding what you're asking. If you can show what you'd like to accomplish in code, that would help me help you
[08:23:58] <Eviltwin> Code + comments explaining the parts you don't know how to do
[08:26:09] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: yes, you could do that easily
[08:26:12] <vovvawrk> how can i do this: $(this).parent().children('.class').children('class2').html('foobar');
[08:26:20] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: but why not put the information in that more sensible structure in the first place?
[08:27:07] <PilotBob> I am trying to select an option in a multi-select using $("#BankAccounts").val(ui.item.id).attr("selected", true) however it deselects other selected items. How can I just add a secltion.
[08:27:30] <Eviltwin> vovvawrk: You do a line of code by doing the line of code
[08:27:34] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the question
[08:28:05] <Eviltwin> PilotBob: I think you can do $("#BankAccounts").val($("#BankAccounts").val().push(ui.item.id))
[08:28:05] <alex88> i'm trying to  use $.datepicker.formatDate, how can i get date from a string like "24/12/11 11:11", i've tried with "dd/mm/y" but how can i set to skip everything after that?
[08:28:08] <black_warlock> halps
[08:28:45] <PilotBob> eviltwin: thanks, I'll try that.
[08:30:25] <beasty> jquery site down ?
[08:30:46] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, Eviltwin sorry, code example is here http://jsfiddle.net/GVkWr/
[08:30:54] <gkatsev> beasty: up for me
[08:31:06] <AdvoWork> see at the moment, that array is sort of seperate, but i'd like to link them somehow so i know that the quantity 1000 is for the price 10 if you get me?
[08:32:28] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: hm... nope that just cleared all the selections.
[08:33:13] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: http://jsfiddle.net/GVkWr/1/
[08:38:01] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, ahh that looks good, so from that can i know how many elements are in there(specific records - in this case 3) ? and from that, can I access 1, 2, 3 seperately?
[08:39:59] <Eviltwin> .length
[08:40:09] <Eviltwin> === 3
[08:43:55] <PilotBob> Anyone else know how I can add a selection to a multi-select <select> item?
[08:45:29] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Uu9Nw/48/
[08:45:34] <black_warlock> halps =(
[08:47:44] <Eviltwin> PilotBob: http://jsfiddle.net/FPTWT/
[08:48:14] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: Dude, I sent you code for this
[08:48:36] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/Uu9Nw/44/
[08:51:09] <black_warlock> nice :d
[08:52:08] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: If you actually try it there, they toggle open and closed with each click because *both* of those things are running
[08:52:18] <Eviltwin> If you remove the old stuff, you should see that it works properly
[08:54:56] <beckyisabunny> if you call .html() on something is it meant to return the surrounding tags?
[08:55:16] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: ah thanks, that works. The previous didn't because push returns the length, not the array.
[08:55:17] <Eviltwin> No, it's the effective equivalent of the .innerHTML
[08:55:29] <Eviltwin> PilotBob: Yeah, forgot about that
[08:55:31] <Eviltwin> Too used to chaining
[08:55:40] <beckyisabunny> Eviltwin: is there a way to get those tags?
[08:56:00] <Eviltwin> beckyisabunny: Why?
[08:57:05] <beckyisabunny> Eviltwin: i'm writing a function to add additional fields to a form which are based on a set of fields that are already on the page when you click an add link.
[08:57:07] <necromancer> beckyisabunny: you can select a tag with an attribute, like using section#articles or header.front-page
[08:57:19] <Eviltwin> beckyisabunny: I suggest you see ?.clone
[08:57:22] <bot-t> beckyisabunny, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:57:25] <necromancer> there ya go
[08:57:26] <necromancer> :)
[08:58:16] <beckyisabunny> Eviltwin: can i then edit the innerhtml of the clone before its displayed?
[08:58:55] <beckyisabunny> okay thanks necromancer and eviltwin : )
[08:59:18] <AdvoWork> if this tells me how many checked elements I have within the table var row_count = $("#add_product_printing_type :checkbox:checked").length;  can I somehow get all id's of the checked elements?
[09:00:45] <Eviltwin> var ids = $("#add_product_printing_type :checkbox:checked").map(function(){return this.id}).get();
[09:00:51] <Eviltwin> ids is now a list of their IDs (in DOM order)
[09:02:00] <Spadeski1> Eviltwin: There a way to say get an id from a URL that the user inputs
[09:02:17] <Spadeski1> if you dont know the parameters?
[09:02:30] <Eviltwin> Spadeski1: URLs don't have IDs...
[09:02:39] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by ID?
[09:02:47] <Spadeski1> ummm
[09:02:50] <Spadeski1> let me show you example
[09:03:09] <Spadeski1> http://www.hulkshare.com/gmyjqnbbaa2l
[09:03:26] <Spadeski1> Get the string at the end or whatever its called
[09:03:39] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, that gives me the ids thanks, what im trying to do is link that to what you mentioned earlier: printing_types[count - 1] = {id: $('#price_break_quantity_' + count).val().replace(/\D/g,"")};  so i want to assign the values of all the elements in that table with the id if you get me?
[09:03:51] <Eviltwin> Well consider this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVNYwC4Iwf0&feature=related
[09:04:07] <Eviltwin> The unique ID for that video is actually WVNYwC4Iwf0
[09:04:29] <Eviltwin> If in that case you wanted "watch?v=WVNYwC4Iwf0&feature=related"
[09:04:32] <Eviltwin> That would be called the path
[09:04:56] <Eviltwin> I suggest you take a look at this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[09:05:10] <Eviltwin> If you need to trim it down more, regular expressions are your best candidate
[09:06:02] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, can i somehow loop though ids and say for $('#tableid (id).val() type of thing?
[09:06:09] <AdvoWork> where (id) is one of the looped through ids?
[09:06:49] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: This isn't parsing for me: $('#tableid (id).val()
[09:06:50] <Eviltwin> What do you mean there?
[09:07:08] <arpegius> i'm not sure if this is best done w/ pure javascript or jquery, but i'm looking to scroll an element whenever the user scrolls anywhere on the page. thoughts?
[09:07:57] <Eviltwin> arpegius: To scroll it how?
[09:08:11] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, this is perfect:  var ids = $("#add_product_printing_type :checkbox:checked").map(function(){return this.id}).get();  it gives me a list of ids that are checked(within my table) such as 1,3, 5.  What im trying to do now is, get the value of that id element within that table, so i can do: printing_types[count - 1] = {id: $('#table' + the id).val() ?? get me?
[09:10:43] <Eviltwin> So you are building a list of IDs of these then want to look them up by ID?
[09:10:47] <Eviltwin> I'm not entirely sure I follow
[09:11:58] <Eviltwin> I think perhaps you're looking for something more like this: http://pastebin.com/iQdN6Die
[09:12:02] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:12:12] <Eviltwin> This: http://pastebin.com/RheTHFfs
[09:12:40] <Eviltwin> Try that and then console.log(stuff) or alert(JSON.stringify(stuff));
[09:13:24] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: why store the ids? why not store the actual DOM elements or the jQuery obejct and then you don't have to look them up again?
[09:14:12] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, if you see http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/8/  im trying to get this bit working id: $('#add_product_printing_type id' + ids).val()
[09:14:41] <Eviltwin> You do understand ids is a list of IDs, right?
[09:15:38] <quicksilver> I have a feeling you want $('#'+ids[count-1]).val();
[09:15:52] <quicksilver> I have a further feeling there are quite a few bits you're not quite following.
[09:15:58] <Eviltwin> "string"+["list"] usually makes bad things happen
[09:18:58] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: I suspect you're looking for something more like: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZpG3/9/
[09:20:05] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to do something that's not built into jQuery for a bunch of different elements, you're probably going to need a .each or .map
[09:20:14] <Eviltwin> Or some kind of loop over all of those things
[09:20:19] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I gotta go
[09:20:21] <Eviltwin> Best of luck.
[09:24:22] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, that works perfectly as far as I can see
[09:24:23] <AdvoWork> thanks
[09:24:31] <AdvoWork> and quicksilver thanks also for the help, really apprecaite it
[09:28:39] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: :)
[09:31:01] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, one query, if doing alert(JSON.stringify(array_elements)); gives: {"printing_types":[{"id":"1","val":""},{"id":"9","val":""},{"id":"12","val":""}],"price_break_details":[{"quantity":"1000","price":"1"},{"quantity":"2000","price":"2"}]}  how would I break that out? or would I pass it that way to php and break it out in php(which I assume makes more sense) ?
[09:31:57] <quicksilver> passing it to PHP as JSON makes sense.
[09:32:05] <quicksilver> PHP must have JSON parsers
[09:32:08] <LekeFly> Can i use jQuery to transform a dropdown (option/select) into lis? :s
[09:33:43] <phatboi> i can't get jquery ui sortable to work in older versions of ff 3.*, but it works in new versions and chrom and ie9, is ff3 just out of it's scope
[09:34:25] <phatboi> oh and php has encode_json() and decode_json()
[09:36:14] <polygon-pusher> is there a way to see what an images original width / height  after css has been applied?
[09:36:36] <polygon-pusher> in short is the a source width / height
[09:37:06] <phatboi> just check the containing div/span's .height() or .width()
[09:37:57] <quicksilver> polygon-pusher: you mean the natural width/height ignoring scaling?
[09:38:02] <polygon-pusher> the thing is I have a div where I'm using overflow hidden and its a fixed width height. I want to check the image and have it fix this whole div proportionately
[09:38:21] <polygon-pusher> fill* not fix
[09:38:39] <quicksilver> naturalWidth and naturalHeight https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Image
[09:38:47] <quicksilver> not supported in old,crappy browsers though
[09:38:57] <polygon-pusher> how old? IE 7
[09:39:05] <quicksilver> no idea :)
[09:39:19] <polygon-pusher> oh thats the dom not jquery
[09:40:04] <polygon-pusher> any one have any good links to having and image of arbitrary size fill a div?
[09:41:43] <phatboi> dom is good
[09:41:46] <polygon-pusher> I have done this in flash many times. Bascily I look to see which is greater ("width or height") then I match the lesser to the closes size of the div. the I off set the remaining image out side of the div
[09:41:46] <phatboi> jquery is bad
[09:41:49] <phatboi> lmao
[09:42:48] <Chopps> hey guys, need help with my function to enable/disable a bunch of select elements, i have 3 select elements, the primary one will enable the other 2 selects if the option selected is different than default, and it will disable if option selected is default, this is what i got http://jsfiddle.net/ZCP7B/ hope u guys can help me out, thanks
[09:43:30] <Chopps> i forgot to mention the select elements i want to enable/disable, all have the same class slct
[09:44:02] <Eviltwin> Chopps: So undisable the first disabled one if you select one
[09:44:08] <Eviltwin> And the second if you select 2?
[09:45:23] <Eviltwin> Chopps?
[09:45:46] <Chopps> no, if selection on main select is default, then the other 2 selects get disable, if selection != default, both selects will get enabled
[09:48:32] <Eviltwin> Chopps: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCP7B/1/
[09:48:38] <Eviltwin> Don't use onchange=""'s
[09:49:09] <Chopps> well i have to, cause i have other functions that need to be triggered onchange
[09:49:40] <Eviltwin> You never need to have an on<event>="" in an element
[09:49:47] <Eviltwin> You can always bind after page load
[09:50:05] <Eviltwin> Which is exactly what I did in this version
[09:51:02] <Chopps> i see, but can i still use onchage for my other functions(other functions are not jquery, just plain old js)
[09:51:38] <NoiseEee> Chopps: same advice
[09:51:56] <NoiseEee> Chopps: inline JS is about as relevant in 2011 as <font> tags
[09:52:04] <NoiseEee> s/relevant/recommended/
[09:52:20] <Eviltwin> Chopps: .addEventListener / .attachEvent
[09:52:23] <Eviltwin> Look 'em up
[09:52:55] <Chopps> ty for the advice guys :D
[09:53:07] <Eviltwin> You can also pack it a bit more if you want: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCP7B/2/
[09:55:11] <Chopps> hehe nice one :D why you guy are so awesome?
[09:55:24] <Eviltwin> Lots of training
[09:56:43] <Chopps> i bet, well this is new for me, but i hope i can get good at it soon
[10:24:09] <justin_donaldson> hello room
[10:25:18] <justin_donaldson> does anyone have experience with truncated ajax responses?
[10:25:35] <justin_donaldson> I've done some googling, and found some other cases, but nothing that matches my own.
[10:25:41] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[10:25:56] <justin_donaldson> I mean that I make a simple ajax post request
[10:26:07] <justin_donaldson> and the result that comes back is incomplete
[10:26:18] <justin_donaldson> I can't reproduce it from curl
[10:26:18] <Eviltwin> And you're sure that the server's sending the whole response?
[10:26:32] <justin_donaldson> yes
[10:26:37] <Eviltwin> Are you using jQuery's $.ajax or $.post ?
[10:26:41] <justin_donaldson> $.ajax
[10:26:46] <Vaerros> any decent cross-browser(in other words, old IE -supporting) way to get amount scrolled vertically on page? was thinking $('body').scrollTop
[10:26:48] <Eviltwin> And it's in the success?
[10:27:08] <justin_donaldson> for simple requests yes
[10:27:30] <Eviltwin> Um...
[10:27:39] <justin_donaldson> it's failing on me for json parsing, naturally
[10:27:44] <Eviltwin> I mean it's triggering the success function?
[10:27:51] <Eviltwin> And you're accessing in there?
[10:27:58] <justin_donaldson> yeah
[10:28:12] <NoiseEee> you're probably sending back bad/invalid data
[10:28:19] <Eviltwin> And it's truncated?
[10:28:23] <Eviltwin> After how many bytes?
[10:28:27] <Eviltwin> How are you generating the JSON on the back end?
[10:28:38] <Eviltwin> Does it always cut off at the same place?
[10:31:03] <justin_donaldson> looks like it does
[10:31:09] <justin_donaldson> I'm checking different browsers
[10:31:14] <Eviltwin> After how many bytes?
[10:31:51] <Eviltwin> Dump the headers with curl and see if the Content-Length is correct
[10:32:47] <justin_donaldson> 44.08KB
[10:32:47] <justin_donaldson> 43.74KB
[10:33:21] <justin_donaldson> the strange thing is that it will occasionally succeed
[10:33:41] <Eviltwin> Did you check to see if the Content-Length is correct
[10:34:35] <RLa> justin_donaldson, what technology is on the server side?
[10:34:45] <justin_donaldson> nginx 0.8 and django
[10:35:07] <Eviltwin> Are you using a library to generate the JSON?
[10:35:23] <RLa> he probably is since he uses django
[10:36:15] <justin_donaldson> I'm talking with one of our backend devs
[10:36:29] <justin_donaldson> now it sounds like the server could be the cause
[10:37:40] <Eviltwin> To be honest that's what I suspected from when you first asked
[10:37:46] <RLa> tho i cannot imagine what could go wrong there
[10:38:12] <Eviltwin> Plenty
[10:38:25] <Eviltwin> Giving a Content-Length in characters instead of bytes
[10:38:28] <Eviltwin> Etc.
[10:40:24] <justin_donaldson> thanks for all the help
[10:40:51] <justin_donaldson> checking some server settings now
[10:42:44] <Pallet> Hi there
[10:42:55] <Pallet> is there a good way to see if jquery is loaded ?
[10:43:13] <Pallet> I'm doing if(typeof(jQuery) == 'undefined') {.... but I'm not sure it's workling
[10:45:57] <joelataylor> hi - I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction:
[10:46:12] <joelataylor> I have a page that loads, then inside that there's an iframe which loads.
[10:46:33] <joelataylor> both pages pull in a js file which has a jquery bind event on the window load
[10:46:40] <joelataylor> however, I only want ONE of them to run
[10:46:47] <sanjayb> Pallet: that seems like a reasonable way of doing it
[10:47:18] <joelataylor> I have limited ability to change the html that is being pulled into both the parent page and the iframe
[10:53:11] <bbonora> how do I find the closest sibling based on the class of the div? I've tried this but it returns a null value $(this).closest('.selector')
[10:58:23] <watermark> So I'm doing a project with EXT (huge javascript library) but many things would be easier to do if jquery were loaded too.  But I only need some very basic jquery functionality.  Can I build a simplified jquery and would it be worth doing so, or am I killing myself for nothing?
[10:58:52] <ajpiano> watermark: there are no build tools for "custom jquery" at the moment
[10:58:54] <NoiseEee> watermark: i would guess there are 'easier' ways to do what you want with EXT
[10:59:06] <ajpiano> but if you're loading all of EXT, then trying to trim down jQuery...
[10:59:23] <ajpiano> it's kind of like, optimising the wrong part
[10:59:30] <watermark> fair point
[11:00:08] <watermark> just trying to find a way to justify loading jquery...but perhaps NoiseEee has a point too and I should just suck it up
[11:00:27] <ajpiano> it's pretty easy to justify it
[11:00:39] <ajpiano> figure out the marginal percentage increase in size of your page
[11:00:41] <ajpiano> from adding jquery
[11:01:32] <watermark> thanks for the advise
[11:01:38] <watermark> *advice
[11:01:39] <danzik17> or depending on what parts of jquery you need, figure out the dependencies and roll your own custom deal
[11:02:12] <watermark> danzik17: sounds like there are no tools to do this and I'm not too interested in hacking something together
[11:02:39] <danzik17> watermark: yea if you don't want to dive into the source a bit, then thats not for you
[11:02:53] <watermark> danzik17: not for this project, thanks anyway
[11:06:25] <operator1> can somebody look at my code. I'm stumped.....
[11:12:56] <KWhat_Work> anyone have any idea why this doesn't work:  http://jsfiddle.net/W73gD/2/   I expected that .next would return the div with Latin in it.
[11:13:04] <Pilate> operator1: after careful analysis ive determined your code is broken
[11:13:55] <DanielP> hello
[11:14:40] <DanielP> I am wondering if there is any way to build html5 apps for linux - like hta for windows
[11:14:51] <Pilate> KWhat_Work: im guessing its because there is no .next of an element you removed
[11:14:53] <operator1> http://jsfiddle.net/1designs/Y2DWK/embedded/result/
[11:14:54] <DanielP> I do not like Appcelerator
[11:15:13] <Pilate> operator1: missing ) after condition
[11:15:17] <Pilate> read your error log
[11:15:19] <DanielP> so I hope you may know some more
[11:15:34] <KWhat_Work> jesus can jsfilddle get any slower
[11:16:50] <halcyon1234> How come I can never seem to get jQueryUI working on jsFiddle. Am I doing something supremely wrong?
[11:16:51] <KWhat_Work> Pilate: there is no element removed in that code
[11:16:51] <Pilate> KWhat_Work: http://jsfiddle.net/W73gD/6/
[11:16:51] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/ktMCF/1/
[11:17:06] <Pilate> KWhat_Work: yes, there is, what do you think .replaceWith does?
[11:17:12] <ngharo> DanielP: have you looked into xulrunner?
[11:17:42] <KWhat_Work> Pilate: replace with a new element
[11:17:56] <Pilate> exactly, so what do you think is happening with the old element, which $(this) refers to?
[11:17:59] <Pilate> its being removed from the dom
[11:18:32] <DanielP> ngharo: I read about that but not yet tried it
[11:19:01] <KWhat_Work> so i need to rerun the selection or do what you did
[11:19:11] <DanielP> do you think it is good for building small Apps / Widgets ?
[11:19:17] <Pilate> either way
[11:19:24] <Pilate> just need a reference to the new element instead of the old one
[11:19:26] <KWhat_Work> Pilate: thanks
[11:20:05] <ngharo> DanielP: it's pretty good.  you define a <browser> element and then just set the src to a local html file.  It's essentially firefox without a gui
[11:20:06] <Engin> is there a thing like dom insertion event ?
[11:20:53] <Pilate> there are mutation events, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents
[11:21:42] <DanielP> any more alternatives I can also google for ?
[11:21:42] <DanielP> then I will take a closer look at it
[11:23:16] <ngharo> mozilla prism
[11:26:13] <necromancer> is there any way to detect whether a browser supports HTML5 placeholder?
[11:26:24] <necromancer> i'd rather not do User-Agent checking as it's unreliable
[11:26:58] <ngharo> ?g html5 placeholder
[11:27:00] <bot-t> ngharo, HTML5's placeholder Attribute - http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder
[11:30:20] <jeffsmykil> @ Eviltwin you around?
[11:32:39] <kukulissimo> hey.. :p  any idea why $(element).height(value) works only once in a row? i've got a thing where i'm using setTimeout to periodically set the height of an element until the mouse button comes up..  everything is fine, except that the height setting only works once
[11:33:25] <jeffsmykil> anyone know the correct syntax for this?  $(".page").append(slideOut).animate({height: 'show'});
[11:35:03] <Anime> is there a way to make drag&drop stuff without jquery ui or other plugins?
[11:35:21] <jeffsmykil> with just plain js yes
[11:35:23] <jeffsmykil> but its a pita
[11:35:23] <kukulissimo> ah nevermind, i've lost the reference to "this"
[11:35:49] <Anime> hm..
[11:36:03] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: $(".page").apend(slideOut).slideDown("slow")
[11:36:07] <rroelofs> ??
[11:36:15] <jeffsmykil> ty
[11:36:40] <jeffsmykil> oh too soon
[11:36:41] <jeffsmykil> doesnt work
[11:36:52] <jeffsmykil> oh you spelled append wrong
[11:37:32] <rroelofs> sorry.  it was only a guess since I can't see the page
[11:38:49] <walid_> Anime: you'll prob end up rewriting the jquery plugin ^^
[11:38:57] <walid_> why you don't want to use a plugin?
[11:40:12] <walid_> Anime: http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/dnd.html
[11:40:16] <walid_> ^^
[11:40:26] <kavelot> is it possible to do $('#a .b .c .d, #a .c .d') more efficiently?
[11:40:43] <Anime> thanks walid
[11:41:25] <Anime> because i wanna learn how to do stuff instead of just tossing everything and prentending to know what's happening
[11:41:31] <ngharo> kavelot: cache $('#a') as a var, and call find() on it
[11:41:40] <kavelot> hm, actually
[11:41:45] <kavelot> by more efficiently I mean with less code :P
[11:41:56] <walid> Anime: hm. been there.
[11:42:02] <walid> Anime: if you got time, good
[11:42:05] <walid> like, a lot
[11:42:38] <ajpiano> kavelot: all you need is $("#a .c .d") ostensibly.   any .c .d that are inside of a will be picked up, regardless of whether they're in b
[11:43:05] <ajpiano> Anime: there's a difference between not using a plugin and not using a plugin FOR REFERENCE*
[11:43:08] <walid> but in the end you(i) end up writing huge modules that are barely reusable, so when i create a new site i have to remodule the whole thing. plus it's generally less efficient than an already made on
[11:43:19] <walid> ajpiano: what's the difference?
[11:43:29] <ajpiano> Anime: you have to learn stuff from somewhere, existing drag and drop implementations are a good starting point for that
[11:43:49] <ajpiano> walid: one is reasonable, the other isn't :)
[11:45:01] <walid> but what is using FOR REFERENCE* ?
[11:45:28] <jeffsmykil> ty rroelofs
[11:45:28] <ajpiano> Anime: for what it's worth, the basic building block of "drag and drop" is a mousedown listener that sets a "dragging" state, then a mousemove handler that moves around some element based on where the mouse is in in the mousemove  handler, and then killing the "dragging" state on mouseup
[11:45:35] <ajpiano> walid: using it as a point of reference
[11:45:44] <ajpiano> as in, reading the code and using it as a learning tool
[11:46:09] <walid> oh sry
[11:46:12] <walid> yep
[11:46:59] <Anime> hmm
[11:47:10] <Anime> is jquery ui from the same people that code jquery?
[11:47:13] <ajpiano> yes
[11:47:15] <Anime> or an external project?
[11:47:18] <ajpiano> well, it's from the jquery project
[11:47:33] <ajpiano> most people who work on core don't actually write code on ui, and vice versa
[11:47:37] <ajpiano> but it's an "official project"
[11:47:40] <ajpiano> if that's what you're asking
[11:47:41] <Anime> why isn't it included in jquery itself?
[11:47:57] <ajpiano> because it's a ui library that is magnitudes larger than just jquery core
[11:48:04] <Anime> got it
[11:49:10] <necromancer> ngharo: thanks man, but do you know why this isn't included in jQuery.support?
[11:50:42] <ajpiano> necromancer: jQuery.support is feature tests that are required to allow jQuery to make the xbrowser normalisations that it does in the course of operating
[11:51:00] <ajpiano> it's not Modernizr
[11:51:02] <necromancer> ajpiano: ah so placeholder isn't part of that
[11:51:02] <ajpiano> which is what you want
[11:51:17] <necromancer> no, what i want is jQuery.support to BE modernizr, so i don't need to load another lib ;-)
[11:52:19] <ajpiano> cool story
[11:52:20] <ajpiano> !
[11:52:35] <necromancer> lol
[11:53:07] <snover> while we’re at it would you like us to add jquery ui to jquery core so you do not have to do load another library for putting dialogs on your page too?
[11:54:00] <ajpiano> snover: i've always wanted to visit venice, but i also have always wanted to visit tokyo.  it it possible to just like, flood the streets of tokyo and boat everwhere, so i don't have to make two different flights?
[11:54:17] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: epcott duh!
[11:54:43] <snover> ajpiano: No, but you could compromise and visit Fukushima
[11:54:53] <jeffsmykil> booooo too soon
[11:54:57] <necromancer> ^^ nice
[11:55:02] <necromancer> not at all jeffsmykil
[11:55:04] <necromancer> PERFECT timing
[11:55:37] <necromancer> snover: no, because jQuery UI is a bloated piece of garbage that I never use
[11:55:46] <necromancer> ;-)
[11:55:52] <necromancer> nah i shouldn't say that
[11:55:54] <ajpiano> you are chock full of cool stories today
[11:55:56] <ajpiano> :D
[11:55:58] <necromancer> lol
[11:56:02] <necromancer> it's nice for what it does though for real
[11:56:06] <necromancer> i just never need to use it
[11:56:17] <necromancer> i tried using progressbar but i found making my own was quicker and easier
[11:56:21] <necromancer> dialog and tabs are the same
[11:56:29] <jeffsmykil> dialogs are so much nicer
[11:56:33] <necromancer> plus i dunno...i never liked the "themeroller look"
[11:57:05] <necromancer> however, UI's widgets do have more ability than mine. like mine can't be dragged around the screen
[11:57:18] <shodan45> hrm, what's the difference between .find() & .children()?
[11:57:38] <NoiseEee> shodan45: find goes all levels deep
[11:57:58] <glauco29> hi
[11:58:01] <glauco29> Can I convert a object to array?
[11:58:15] <glauco29> I need use .join function
[11:58:57] <groovetrain> shodan: find() traverses down the tree getting all descendants, whereas children() just gets first descendant
[11:59:35] <groovetrain> err, gets the first level of descendants (with optional filter)
[12:00:26] <groovetrain> glauco29: is this what you're needing: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[12:11:31] <jeffsmykil> can i do a on click of anything but this element?
[12:11:34] <jeffsmykil> somehow
[12:12:05] <manuell_> hi
[12:17:21] <groovetrain> jeffsmykil: check out the :not pseudoclass in the jquery doc
[12:17:33] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[12:17:38] <jeffsmykil> ty
[12:17:39] <gyzmodo> i've this code: http://pastebin.com/pCCABjiN
[12:17:44] <gyzmodo> it works very well
[12:18:05] <gyzmodo> how can i add here removeClass function?
[12:18:34] <BarelyFitz> gyzmodo: do you want it to be a toggle?
[12:18:55] <gyzmodo> yeah
[12:19:01] <gyzmodo> but without toggleClass
[12:19:02] <gyzmodo> :)
[12:19:18] <hdon> any jquery ui guys here?
[12:19:30] <hdon> i don't need help i just want to discuss possible changes to jqui
[12:19:50] <BarelyFitz> why without toggleClass?
[12:19:57] <groovetrain> hdon: should go to  #jqueryui-dev
[12:20:18] <barbagallo> hello jQueryiers :)
[12:20:27] <hdon> groovetrain: ah thanks :)
[12:20:40] <gyzmodo> because .popup is a div and he has close link
[12:20:50] <gyzmodo> moment
[12:23:16] <gyzmodo> BarelyFitz, http://jsfiddle.net/HzYeG/
[12:23:19] <gyzmodo> look here
[12:24:46] <gyzmodo> i want to hide .popup when user clicks to Show popup/Close link
[12:24:51] <gyzmodo> how can i do it?
[12:24:59] <yamahaalex> iit seems the only way i can load global variables is to put my script at end of html body
[12:25:09] <yamahaalex> is there another way to have the entire ext js file execute, rather than just a function
[12:26:08] <cloke> does anyone know of a may to use an event delegate on draggables?
[12:27:01] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[12:27:36] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you have time for a question?
[12:27:58] <ajpiano> ask it and we'll find out
[12:29:55] <jeffsmykil> i have this search menu that slides out, and im trying to get it to hide only when you click off of it
[12:30:01] <jeffsmykil> but im having a hell of a time
[12:32:28] <necromancer> gyzmodo: ?toggleClass
[12:32:34] <necromancer> wtf
[12:32:56] <gyzmodo> okay, toggleClass
[12:33:06] <necromancer> lol i was trying to link to the docs
[12:33:08] <gyzmodo> how can i close .popup when user clicks to Close link
[12:33:09] <necromancer> ?toggleClass
[12:33:09] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[12:33:30] <necromancer> gyzmodo: how did you set up the click action for .appointment?
[12:33:40] <necromancer> it's the same thing
[12:33:59] <necromancer> just replace .appointment with .close. you'll also need to add the "close" class to the <a> you want to activate the close action
[12:34:02] <solidus-river> is there a good plugin for stylable scroll bars?
[12:34:08] <solidus-river> is this part of the css standard now?
[12:34:08] <necromancer> solidus-river: jScrollPane
[12:34:13] <necromancer> not at all
[12:34:33] <gyzmodo> necromancer, how can i get same effect with removeClass?
[12:35:04] <solidus-river> necromancer: damnhit htis is such a waste of time... i hate google for stylizing gmail scroll bars
[12:35:07] <necromancer> gyzmodo: have you read the docs for removeClass, addClass and toggleClass?
[12:35:44] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ jeffsmykil
[12:35:44] <necromancer> solidus-river: oh yeah that's SO ugly!!
[12:35:44] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:35:48] <necromancer> especially on OS X Lion
[12:35:56] <eddiemonge> ^^^ you two gyzmodo
[12:36:06] <necromancer> eddiemonge: he's asking very obvious questions that can be answered with a simple peruse of the docs.
[12:36:28] <necromancer> eddiemonge: his demo is @ http://jsfiddle.net/HzYeG/
[12:36:29] <eddiemonge> necromancer: to me it sounds like a different question than whats being asked
[12:36:39] <necromancer> lol maybe
[12:36:45] <necromancer> you're better at this than i am haha
[12:40:02] <insign> in jquery validation, how can I inform a min lenght inline?
[12:40:20] <gyzmodo> necromancer, http://jsfiddle.net/HzYeG/1/
[12:40:23] <gyzmodo> look here
[12:40:23] <insign> <input type="text" name="cpf" value="" class="input mask-cpf valid" minlength="5"> arent working
[12:40:31] <gyzmodo> for first time in works well
[12:41:56] <necromancer> gyzmodo: you don't need two classes
[12:42:03] <necromancer> gyzmodo: you just need to removeClass('show')
[12:42:26] <necromancer> gyzmodo: http://jsfiddle.net/HzYeG/2/

[12:58:44] <Raydiation> this is not interpreted by $.getJSON
[12:59:13] <yamahaalex> can anyone please help me why my canvas wont resize
[12:59:18] <yamahaalex> the height
[12:59:20] <yamahaalex> its really short code: http://jsfiddle.net/eUSn3/
[12:59:45] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: try var canvas = $('#canvas')[0]
[12:59:55] <polygon-pusher> I'm new to js and jquery. As a tool for learing I'm making a jq plugin. my question is a noob one so forgive me but how do I make a constant var in js for uses in a plugin
[13:00:13] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: or var canvas.attr("height", height)
[13:00:55] <yamahaalex> hmm
[13:01:04] <yamahaalex> first one didnt work, dont think
[13:01:09] <yamahaalex> maybe ill use normal js to get canvas id
[13:01:13] <jackweb> Hello! How to send using $.ajax variable x using POST and y using GET?
[13:01:18] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: no wait^^
[13:01:33] <Raydiation> what your doing is: you get a jquery object in the canvas var
[13:01:38] <NoiseEee> jackweb: why?
[13:01:52] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: to get the dom element use canvas[0]
[13:02:08] <jackweb> because my file gets type of action in GET variable
[13:02:12] <Raydiation> like you did with context
[13:02:13] <donCams> polygon-pusher: var MY_CONTANT = 1
[13:02:29] <jackweb> NoiseEE: data are received from POST
[13:02:30] <donCams> const myVar = 1
[13:02:36] <yamahaalex> like that?
[13:02:36] <yamahaalex> http://jsfiddle.net/eUSn3/4/
[13:02:36] <NoiseEee> jackweb: url:'something.php?action=whatevs'
[13:02:48] <NoiseEee> jackweb: just a guess though, tias
[13:03:00] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: yeah, but fix var ctx = canvas[0].getContext("2d");
[13:03:15] <polygon-pusher> I was just reading that this is const but its not wildly supported yet.
[13:03:15] <Raydiation> you dont need [0] any more
[13:03:25] <jackweb> NoiseEee: I tried it, but GET variable in URL is ignored :(
[13:04:20] <jackweb> when I am mixing POST and GET, no variable is 'transfered'
[13:04:29] <jackweb> (data → POST, url → GET)
[13:04:33] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: ah yeah, and you need to get the canvas with jquery
[13:04:43] <yamahaalex> why
[13:05:07] <yamahaalex> http://jsfiddle.net/eUSn3/9/
[13:05:09] <yamahaalex> still not working
[13:05:13] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: http://jsfiddle.net/eUSn3/11/
[13:05:17] <yamahaalex> but i did use ordinary js getdocument etc
[13:06:33] <NoiseEee> jackweb: what lang is the backend
[13:06:39] <yamahaalex> thank you Raydiation
[13:06:43] <jackweb> PHP :>
[13:06:50] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: did you understand the problem?
[13:07:05] <jackweb> on the top I am using var_dump($_GET, $_POST); and it returns empty arrays
[13:07:35] <jackweb> * empty arrays when I use GET in 'url' and POST in 'data' ('type': 'POST')
[13:08:07] <donCams> use $_REQUEST *evil grin*
[13:08:22] <yamahaalex> yeah i do understand, im not sure why jquery turns it intoan arry and js not though
[13:09:50] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: imagine there are 2 canvas elements
[13:10:01] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: then $("canvas") would match 2 canvas elements
[13:10:46] <yamahaalex> not if its by id Raydiation
[13:11:00] <Raydiation> yamahaalex: yeah, but i guess they just want to stay consistant
[13:11:27] <yamahaalex> yeah, i do understand whats happening now though, i appreciate your help
[13:11:41] <Eviltwin> What do you mean
[13:11:49] <Eviltwin> Why it's an array if it's only one element?
[13:11:56] <yamahaalex-brb> lol
[13:13:22] <Raydiation> yamahaalex-brb: yw
[13:13:41] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: just because its 1 element doesnt mean it cant be in an array
[13:14:04] <Eviltwin> I never said anything to the contrary
[13:14:10] <Raydiation> btw i found my json problem. why tf do single quotes not work in json
[13:14:15] <Eviltwin> The misunderstanding is that it is an array
[13:14:31] <Eviltwin> 'Cause it's JSON not JavaScript
[13:14:39] <Eviltwin> http://www.json.org/
[13:14:50] <Eviltwin> Conveinent little diagrams explaining exactly what is and isn't valid
[13:15:13] <Eviltwin> Bare keys also technically aren't valid
[13:16:02] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: kinda reminds me of pl sql where only ' is a valid quote
[13:16:30] <jackweb> NoiseEee: I forgot to write '&' as first letter in 'data'; thanks! :)
[13:16:53] <Eviltwin> Well for one thing, there's nothing that says all programming languages must support '' and "" for strings
[13:17:10] <Eviltwin> In C, "" refers to a string and '' refers to a character
[13:17:53] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: well, but it makes debugging hell
[13:17:54] <Eviltwin> There's never strictly a need to have both for strings
[13:17:57] <Eviltwin> How?
[13:18:16] <Raydiation> because its a special exception for which you dont look for
[13:18:24] <Eviltwin> What's a special exception?
[13:18:25] <Raydiation> its not the first thing that comes to your mind
[13:18:43] <Raydiation> well, that the $.getJSON does not work because i used ' instead of "
[13:18:44] <mightym> hey guys, i need a hint, i have this function which fades in a label on mouse in, and fades it out if the mouse leaves the element, my problem is, that if i hover let us say 10 times over the element, the fadein/fadeout is executed 10 times and takes several seconds till it stops. but i just want to fade out 1 time if the mouse left the element and nothing more. i tried stop() before fadeIn() and fadeOut() but that doesn't give a good solution …
[13:18:44] <mightym> someone a hint for me? thx in advance
[13:18:50] <Raydiation> also theres no error msg
[13:18:55] <snover> Raydiation: life is hard.
[13:19:02] <mightym> here is my code http://www.pastie.org/3023031
[13:19:03] <Eviltwin> There absolutely are error messages
[13:19:09] <Eviltwin> Unless you're using a crap parsing library
[13:19:09] <Raydiation> not in firebug
[13:19:25] <Eviltwin> Use jsonlint
[13:19:49] <Eviltwin> mightym: see ?.stop
[13:19:50] <bot-t> mightym, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[13:19:57] <Eviltwin> There are two boolean flags
[13:20:06] <Eviltwin> Understand what they do
[13:20:41] <Eviltwin> You can put a stop before the fadeIn or a stop before the fadeOut or both or neither
[13:20:47] <Eviltwin> They all produce different behaviors
[13:20:57] <Eviltwin> And for those toy can use any combination of the flags
[13:22:55] <mightym> Eviltwin, yes that was i trying, i tried also this http://www.pastie.org/3023031 but the result is: yes it stops complete after mouse out, but the fade in also stops again when die fadeout stops, an after several mousin/mousesouts there is no more animation
[13:23:08] <Eviltwin> mightym: Why don't you do this in a jsFiddle
[13:23:16] <Eviltwin> So we can see what's happening
[13:23:28] <Eviltwin> And you can tell us what you don't like about it
[13:23:38] <Eviltwin> And we can play with it
[13:23:56] <mightym> Eviltwin: oh sry, ok ill try
[13:28:35] <Eviltwin> I don't mean reproduce your whole page
[13:28:46] <Eviltwin> Just like one or two elements and slab your pastie JS in there
[13:30:22] <unclemantis> how can i make the background image of a container scroll up and down?
[13:30:35] <Raydiation> btw is there a plugin for firefox which shows html errors?
[13:30:38] <Eviltwin> You mean change the offset?
[13:30:51] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: Almost all HTML errors are non-fatal
[13:31:15] <manuell_> hi, i have some trouble with .getScript, if i try .getScript('http://pastebin.com/yW8kq94Y') it works with firefox, but not with IE,
[13:31:16] <Eviltwin> I thought Firebug did something
[13:31:18] <Eviltwin> But maybe not
[13:31:23] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: i just oversaw a / in a <td> which caused ff to render to <td>s
[13:31:28] <Eviltwin> I usually use http://validator.w3.org/
[13:31:40] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: i deploy locally
[13:31:52] <Eviltwin> It lets you upload a file
[13:31:56] <Eviltwin> Or paste in HTML
[13:32:02] <Raydiation> to much of a hassle
[13:32:07] <Eviltwin> Pfft
[13:32:13] <Eviltwin> So's helping you :P
[13:32:26] <Eviltwin> ;)
[13:32:28] <Raydiation> :_D
[13:33:51] <manuell_> sry, my link was wrong, the script looks like: http://pastebin.com/yW8kq94Y
[13:33:56] <jetienne_> q. i got the jquery( liElement ) of a given item in a <ul>, but i would like to know the position of this <li> in the <ul>, how can i do that ? i mean i want to know if it is the first, or the 3rd etc...
[13:34:58] <dandrinkard> jetienne_: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:36:18] <jetienne_> dandrinkard: thanks it does the job
[13:36:42] <manuell_> nobody an idea ?
[13:37:13] <Eviltwin> manuell_: This? http://pastebin.com/yW8kq94Y
[13:37:23] <Eviltwin> That was the same link you sent before
[13:37:49] <manuell_> yes, but there was an ' after the link
[13:38:05] <Eviltwin> So you're using getScript on that URL?
[13:38:21] <Eviltwin> Or that's the actual code you're using
[13:38:36] <manuell_> thats my code iam using
[13:38:45] <mightym> Eviltwin: here you see my problem, hover several times over the box, and you will see the effect http://jsfiddle.net/kNyNV/6/
[13:38:46] <Eviltwin> Okay
[13:38:55] <Eviltwin> manuell_: Count your {'s and }'s
[13:39:17] <manuell_> it works with chrome and firefox
[13:40:03] <jetienne_> dandrinkard: if i do a jquery(myselector) and it returns several elements, is there a function to get the 3rd for example ?
[13:40:28] <Eviltwin> mightym: How about this: http://jsfiddle.net/kNyNV/7/ ?
[13:40:29] <dandrinkard> jetienne_: jQuery('selector').eq(2)
[13:40:43] <jetienne_> dandrinkard: thanks again
[13:40:45] <dandrinkard> np
[13:40:47] <Eviltwin> manuell_: You have mismatched {}'s there
[13:41:00] <mightym> Eviltwin: wow, thats it
[13:41:09] <mightym> Eviltwin: thy a lot mate!
[13:41:28] <Eviltwin> mightym: I've had to write that code many times so it was no problem
[13:41:49] <mightym> but no I'm going to read it and try to understand it, thanks a lot!
[13:42:05] <Eviltwin> mightym: see ?.stop and see ?.fadeTo
[13:42:05] <bot-t> mightym, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[13:42:05] <bot-t> mightym, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[13:42:42] <manuell_> Eviltwin: at which line ?
[13:42:48] <manuell_> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/i5kBuZfD this also wont work
[13:43:21] <Eviltwin> manuell_: I want you to start at the beginning of that file
[13:43:27] <Eviltwin> Proceed character by character
[13:43:32] <Eviltwin> Start with a counter at 0
[13:43:38] <Eviltwin> Every time you see a { increase it by 1
[13:43:42] <Eviltwin> Every time you see a } decrease it by 1
[13:43:55] <Eviltwin> Tell me what number your counter ends at
[13:45:17] <manuell_> oh shit
[13:45:32] <Eviltwin> The problem is line 8 in the first link
[13:45:34] <Eviltwin> Line 3 in the second
[13:45:38] <Eviltwin> Just remove the }
[13:45:43] <Eviltwin> And everything should be fine
[13:46:53] <manuell_> okay, it was just an past failure
[13:47:06] <pentarex> hey guys I am having some problem with my script.. can someone help me http://jsfiddle.net/PWCwJ/  ,please if someone bother helping me, see the code then I will explain further.. thank you :)
[13:49:58] <unclejerk> looking for a jquery effect that allows a background image to scroll back and forth within a container. Kinda like what last.fm does
[13:50:04] <borillion> can someone explain to me the diff between $(var) and $var
[13:50:30] <borillion> is $(var) a de-reference?
[13:51:50] <pentarex> anyone ?
[13:52:02] <BarelyFitz> borillion: $(var) means take var and pass it to jquery. $var is just a variable named "$var". usually if a variable name starts with $ assume it contains a jquery object.
[13:52:07] <manuell_> Eviltwin: i tried http://pastebin.com/RbHAnuaC , no problems with ff, but with IE
[13:52:07] <unclejerk> that's a big 10-4 on that goose egg good buddy!
[13:52:13] <andrew9183> pentarex: why not use ' and " to not have to use \" \"
[13:52:50] <BarelyFitz> pentarex: ids must be unique, you are creating multiple divs with the same id
[13:53:52] <pentarex> andrew9183: it is because of the jsp... i forgot to fix it after posting it into jsfidle :)
[13:53:52] <borillion> right so if I say alert($(event.target).next()); why do I see [object Object]
[13:54:28] <pentarex> BarelyFitz: yeah but as you can see there is no problem, the problem is I think with this after going to mouseover then into another anonymous function that comes from the get
[13:54:44] <BarelyFitz> borillion: because .next() returns a jquery object
[13:55:10] <borillion> so I have to say $(event.target).next()[0]?
[13:55:16] <pentarex> I am trying to use ¨this¨ into this anonymous function.... I think this is the problem
[13:55:58] <pentarex> BarelyFitz: ahh my comments are gone.. why is that
[13:56:10] <unclejerk> looking for a scrolling background plugin.
[13:56:12] <unclejerk> anyone?
[13:56:38] <yamahaalex-brb> what is jquery equivalent of evt.keyCode
[13:56:43] <borillion> nm got it
[13:57:01] <yamahaalex-brb> if i want a switch case for keydown events
[13:57:15] <manuell_> @ yamahaalex-brb keyCode
[13:58:05] <manuell_> ('#yourElement').keypress(function(e) { if(e.keycode == 13)}; for Enter
[13:58:25] <yamahaalex> why do i need an element?
[13:58:35] <yamahaalex> if i just want a function to execute on keydown
[13:59:17] <pentarex> BarelyFitz: http://jsfiddle.net/pentarex/PWCwJ/1/ see the code now with the function... it´s not working now but still the java servlet is returng result :)
[13:59:19] <hightekvagabond> if you use keyup instead of keydown or keypress you avoid repeat characters from people holding down a key for an extended period of time
[13:59:26] <manuell_> keydown on what ?
[13:59:35] <BarelyFitz> yamahaalex: you can probably do $(document).keydown() to catch any keydown event?
[13:59:35] <yamahaalex> i need keydown for character to move while held down
[13:59:48] <hightekvagabond> ah
[14:00:23] <hightekvagabond> then I'm with BArelFitz, put it on the document
[14:00:54] <multipass|2> anyone know how i can fix this...IE tries to save Ajax response as file. Trying to ajax submit info-- works on all but one form on site. has multipast coding
[14:00:54] <yamahaalex> so (document).keypress(function etc?
[14:01:25] <manuell_> but $(document) catch also typing in textarea, select, input...
[14:01:34] <yamahaalex> hmm
[14:03:00] <solidus-river> told my boss's implimenting a scroll bar theme is a bad decision relying on hacked together implimentations in jquery and is non standards compliant
[14:03:03] <solidus-river> i hope they fold
[14:04:58] <BarelyFitz> pentarex: that code is all fubar
[14:05:17] <manuell_> no one an idea about getting this: http://pastebin.com/RbHAnuaC via .getScript with IE ?... works with ff and chrome... this damn IE...
[14:06:07] <yamahaalex> do i need a listener for jquery keydoen
[14:06:08] <yamahaalex> down
[14:06:37] <pentarex> BarelyFitz: tell me something that I dont know :)
[14:07:56] <pentarex> BarelyFitz: so you cannot tell me where is the problem coming from
[14:08:16] <yamahaalex> i dont understand, what if i dont want a #target
[14:08:18] <yamahaalex> $('#target').keydown(function() {
[14:08:25] <yamahaalex> i just want on .keydown, function to happen
[14:08:59] <BarelyFitz> pentarex: you have numerous basic syntax errors, and have not explained what it is you're trying to do. and I gotta go soon, sorry
[14:09:17] <BarelyFitz> yamahaalex: $(document).keydown(function(){ ... });
[14:09:43] <yamahaalex> BarelyFitz, what if i want it to happen while an area is active
[14:09:48] <yamahaalex> because its for a game
[14:09:54] <yamahaalex> hmm... maybe i should just leave it on document
[14:10:20] <yamahaalex> i was thinking i should have it only while they are clicked in the game area
[14:10:26] <yamahaalex> and if they click outside, the controls dont work
[14:10:29] <yamahaalex> like most flash games
[14:10:30] <BarelyFitz> yamahaalex: bind the event while the area is active. unbind it when the area is no longer active.
[14:11:55] <yamahaalex> thank you BarelyFitz
[14:11:57] <unclejerk> sorry guys but wtf is this talking about? I don't have a reference to scrollSpy anywhere. Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'scrollSpy'
[14:13:03] <yamahaalex> BarelyFitz, is there jquery code i should search for detecting if canvas is active
[14:13:48] <manuell_> okay, its late, i think i ask again tomorrow
[14:13:54] <manuell_> gn8

[14:23:08] <LordThumper> Does anyone use Fancybox? Is there any way to show a box from javascript without linking the box with a link?
[14:23:55] <chuck_tes> hi. this isn't really a jqeuery question as much as it is a generic question. i just finished my site and  I forgot what I am supposed to name the main page on when I upload it via FTP. It should be named like index.htaccess or htaccess.html? I forgot. Thanks.
[14:23:56] <rolnxyz> how do i know if any of the parents of div with id "a" has a click event bound to it?
[14:25:13] <LordThumper> index.html
[14:25:38] <chuck_tes> oh ok thanks.
[14:26:53] <jeffsmykil> how do i measure the height of an element that is placed after dom load?
[14:27:12] <LordThumper> chuck_tes: Open your FTP client
[14:27:33] <LordThumper> open .htaccess in the directory with a text editor
[14:27:42] <LordThumper> DirectoryIndex index.html
[14:27:46] <LordThumper> Should be something like tht
[14:27:49] <LordThumper> that*
[14:28:32] <LordThumper> If you are using php you should name your main file something like index.php or default.php
[14:29:32] <chuck_tes> I don't think im using php. I'm tyring what you said now. brb
[14:30:29] <jeffsmykil> LordThumper: You have any idea how to meausre the height of an object after the dom loads?
[14:30:37] <jeffsmykil> err thats placed after the dom loads
[14:31:43] <LordThumper> jeffsmykil: No idea mate, I am very new to javascript/jquery
[14:31:51] <jeffsmykil> thanks anyways
[14:38:51] <borillion>     $p.children('img')[0].attr('background-color','red'); gives me the error Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method 'attr'
[14:39:21] <jeffsmykil> because you need to use .css
[14:39:23] <jeffsmykil> not attr
[14:39:48] <borillion> same issue
[14:40:05] <jeffsmykil> um you need brackets
[14:40:08] <jeffsmykil> around p
[14:40:11] <jeffsmykil> and quotes
[14:40:20] <jeffsmykil> $("p").children
[14:40:23] <borillion> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method 'css'
[14:40:35] <jeffsmykil> wait its not an object
[14:40:37] <jeffsmykil> its an element
[14:40:41] <jeffsmykil> what are you trying to do
[14:40:44] <borillion> ohhhh dur yea lol
[14:40:56] <borillion> get the img element inside of a div
[14:41:10] <jeffsmykil> whats the zero for?
[14:41:11] <helpcrypto> hi
[14:41:27] <helpcrypto> could you please tell me why, a so simple thing doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/ ?
[14:41:51] <borillion> cause $p is a event.target
[14:42:15] <jeffsmykil> borillion: make a fiddle
[14:42:59] <borillion> jeffsmykil, http://jsfiddle.net/efPqw/
[14:43:57] <necromancer> how would i alter the following CSS rule with jQuery? "input[type="search"]::-webkit-search-decoration"
[14:44:07] <necromancer> also is it possible lol
[14:44:21] <helpcrypto> using firebug it says "login is not defined". maybe the js jquery file is breaking my dom?
[14:46:15] <DukeDrake> If I do var myvar = $('#somvar).val() - how do I check if myvar is undefined?
[14:46:15] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me
[14:46:22] <borillion> necromancer, look at .css
[14:46:26] <coldhead> myvar === undefined
[14:46:32] <DukeDrake> coldhead: thanx
[14:46:37] <coldhead> pleasure
[14:46:58] <necromancer> borillion: i know what .css() does, but that rule is non-standard and i'm not sure how to select it. notice the "::-webkit-search-decoration"...how do i access that property in .css()?
[14:46:58] <helpcrypto> could you please tell me why this "hello world" thing doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/ ?
[14:47:40] <borillion> yea you want the part after the :: right?
[14:50:52] <eggsby> is there a reason that document.querySelector('#myid') would work with a library where $('#myid') wouldn't ?
[14:50:58] <borillion> necromancer, split it and then append it
[14:51:24] <helpcrypto> eggsby: i dont know if it is what you are asking
[14:51:49] <helpcrypto> but i have found that jquery.ajax works where $.ajax
[14:51:50] <polygon-pusher> I need to wrap a new div around my img tag in jquery?  how do I do it
[14:51:59] <necromancer> borillion: that wouldn't make sense. there needs to be a way to select that, you can't do that from just within CSS
[14:52:10] <helpcrypto> (in our case, cause our development framework uses/requires $
[14:52:28] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you there?
[14:52:32] <borillion> necromancer, you want to change that to something else after the colons right
[14:52:35] <necromancer> like if i do $('input[type="search"]').css({color: '#FFF'});, it will find the rule for input[type="search"], not the "::-webkit-search-decoration"
[14:52:44] <necromancer> those are two separate rules
[14:52:45] <polygon-pusher> $(img).html("<div>"+$(this)+"</div>");
[14:52:48] <necromancer> from what it looks like
[14:53:47] <eggsby> I suppose my question is can document.querySelector and jquery selection be used interchangeably or is there some sort of way to get the same representation of the data?
[14:55:09] <helpcrypto> afaik, jquery. and $. are the same with two names
[14:55:18] <helpcrypto> btw, could yo check this: http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/5/ ?
[14:55:51] <helpcrypto> i thinks its code blind
[14:55:58] <helpcrypto> 'cause i dont see the problem
[14:56:07] <borillion> necromancer, have you tried to change the class to one with only that line changed?
[14:56:26] <necromancer> borillion: i don't think you understand my problem
[14:56:27] <necromancer> hold on
[14:56:34] <borillion> jeffsmykil, any idea?
[14:56:49] <borillion> necromancer, set up a jsfiddle
[14:57:08] <jeffsmykil> sorry I stopped looking been at work since 7:30 and no sight of going home
[14:57:11] <jeffsmykil> and skipped lunch
[14:57:48] <borillion> oh kk thats cool, dont stress so much jeffsmykil
[14:58:44] <necromancer> borillion: http://jsfiddle.net/KRZe6/
[14:58:45] <sylvieg> what does $row=$('<tr/>'); mean?
[14:59:35] <necromancer> sylvieg: it means someone is setting the variable $row to the jQuery object for a created <tr> element. this element has not been added to the DOM, just created in the "ether" of your JS code. until you .append($row) somewhere, it's not a "real object" on the page.
[15:00:08] <sylvieg> thx necromancer
[15:00:40] <sylvieg> btw do you recommend a good book to learn? I am still strungle soemtimes
[15:03:27] <eggsby> more specifically... does anyone know why 'getComputedStyle' doesnt work on a jquery selection
[15:04:26] <helpcrypto> please!!! whyu this doesnt work on my computer? does anyone see what im unable to see? damm code blindness!!! http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/8/
[15:06:16] <LordThumper> .trigger('click') is firing a link's onclick event but not actually clicking it (following the link)
[15:06:18] <LordThumper> Any ideas?
[15:06:18] <sylvieg> when I do $row.append($('<a/>').text('ccc').attr('href', ...) , I have an error attr is not a function. Is it because I do this after the text and not after the <a> stuff?
[15:06:29] <helpcrypto> please!!! whyu this doesnt work on my computer? does anyone see what im unable to see? damm code blindness!!! http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/8/
[15:07:05] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: do you have <a href=... +click event ?
[15:07:14] <LordThumper> ye both
[15:07:21] <LordThumper> href and onclick
[15:07:26] <LordThumper> onclick is firing
[15:07:53] <helpcrypto> try return true or something oposed as preventdefault...but i dont see the point of have both of them
[15:08:28] <LordThumper> no point
[15:08:29] <helpcrypto> onclick="return yourfunc()";
[15:08:31] <LordThumper> the link was not working
[15:08:36] <LordThumper> so i added onclick to test
[15:08:53] <helpcrypto> just the 2a" is not working?
[15:09:11] <helpcrypto> paste your <a href line
[15:09:14] <helpcrypto> and...
[15:09:18] <LordThumper> sure
[15:09:22] <helpcrypto> please!!! why this doesnt work on my computer? does anyone see what im unable to see? damm code blindness!!! http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/8/
[15:09:45] <LordThumper> <a id="fancybox_handler" href="http://www.google.com" onclick="alert('hello');">Hidden Clicker</a>
[15:09:46] <LordThumper> </div>
[15:09:52] <LordThumper> sorry about that div...
[15:10:04] <helpcrypto> remove the onclick
[15:10:19] <helpcrypto> that should go to google
[15:10:40] <helpcrypto> if not, you are probably messing some events with $("a")
[15:11:27] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone know how to get the height of an item that is appended after the DOM loads?
[15:11:28] <LordThumper> ye nothing
[15:12:16] <LordThumper> The link is in a hidden div
[15:12:20] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: jsfiddle your page...but believe me, a simple <a> should work, unless you make some crap
[15:12:22] <LordThumper> Could that be a problem?
[15:12:28] <LordThumper> ok will do
[15:12:32] <helpcrypto> no, show the div to check
[15:12:43] <DukeDrake> What's the select for all input elemnts of type 'radio'?  $('input[type=radio]') ?
[15:12:44] <helpcrypto> if its hidden, how can you test it?....
[15:12:55] <helpcrypto> or...are you invoking a click from js?
[15:13:06] <helpcrypto> DukeDrake: try ;)
[15:13:07] <LordThumper> yes
[15:13:13] <LordThumper> .trigger('click')
[15:13:23] <DukeDrake> do not waaaant! =)
[15:13:39] <helpcrypto> have u ever header about REDIRECTING location
[15:13:46] <borillion> necromancer http://jsfiddle.net/kEEuE/
[15:13:52] <helpcrypto> instead of "clicking a link from js", just redirect
[15:13:52] <borillion> thats your solution
[15:14:00] <LordThumper> Div is now visible
[15:14:04] <LordThumper> not working either
[15:14:10] <helpcrypto> borillion: please!!! why this doesnt work on my computer? does anyone see what im unable to see? damm code blindness!!! http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/8/
[15:14:14] <LordThumper> .trigger('click') is probably the problem
[15:14:28] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: paste your code on jsfiddle
[15:14:30] <DukeDrake> works ...
[15:14:37] <helpcrypto> DukeDrake: :P
[15:14:51] <necromancer> borillion: no, it's not. i want javascript to change the placeholder text color.
[15:15:04] <helpcrypto> please!!! why this doesnt work on my computer? does anyone see what im unable to see? damm code blindness!!! http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/8/
[15:15:18] <justin_donaldson> hi folks
[15:15:30] <justin_donaldson> I was asking questions about truncated ajax earlier
[15:15:35] <justin_donaldson> I figured out the problem
[15:16:03] <necromancer> helpcrypto: http://jsfiddle.net/vFLMV/10/ does that work?
[15:16:09] <borillion> necromancer, lol kk you want it to be red before you type?
[15:16:12] <justin_donaldson> http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2011/05/13/gunicorn-apache-zero-length.html
[15:16:24] <justin_donaldson> it was gunicorn + nginx related
[15:16:50] <hdon> hi all :) i've implemented a "resizer bar" that bisects an area into two areas whose share of the total area can be adjusted by grabbing the "resizer bar" and dragging it left or right
[15:17:13] <necromancer> borillion: that's right. but i want JS to control it. it's for a cross-browser plugin i'm writing that leverages placeholder="" in HTML5 browsers, but if it's not available it falls back to a JS implementation of the same concept. but what i want is to be able to set the placeholder color from within JS so it can be applied to either the ::webkit-placeholder thing or the CSS of the actual element.
[15:17:19] <hdon> does anyone know how to prevent the browser from trying to highlight the contents of the page that the user might be inadvertently selecting?
[15:17:21] <justin_donaldson> the solution was to disable proxy_buffering in nginx: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule
[15:17:44] <helpcrypto> necromancer: not working :(
[15:17:47] <justin_donaldson> thanks again to @Eviltwin and others for their help
[15:17:53] <necromancer> helpcrypto: what's your browser?
[15:17:57] <helpcrypto> ff
[15:18:00] <helpcrypto> 801
[15:18:04] <helpcrypto> my mistake

[15:18:17] <necromancer> oh wait n/m i'm using chrome
[15:18:44] <helpcrypto> necromancer: encoding?
[15:18:57] <helpcrypto> what format should i save the doc...ut8-without BOM?
[15:19:10] <necromancer> i have no idea what you're talking about
[15:19:25] <helpcrypto> lol
[15:19:39] <helpcrypto> doesnt work on ie either
[15:19:41] <necromancer> helpcrypto: works for me in 8.0.1
[15:19:49] <necromancer> clear your cache
[15:20:32] <helpcrypto> still here?
[15:20:53] <helpcrypto> ...
[15:21:36] <helpcrypto> well...i think strange things start to appear. cleared my cache and wasnt disconnected from webchat?
[15:21:38] <helpcrypto> hmmm
[15:22:43] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/TwbBM/1/
[15:22:49] <LordThumper> Thats the code
[15:23:16] <helpcrypto> necromancer: ok...now i know why the error
[15:23:22] <helpcrypto> im printing the dom from php
[15:23:32] <necromancer> yeah don't ever do that
[15:23:37] <necromancer> ;-)
[15:23:45] <yamahaalex-brb> is there a way i can detect if a canvas is active
[15:23:53] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: when do you want to redirect to a's url....on ready?
[15:23:53] <yamahaalex-brb> ng. (B-side: Tired of Fighting))

[15:23:54] <yamahaalex-brb> <yamahaalex-brb> is there a way i can detect if a canvas is active
[15:23:54] <yamahaalex-brb> <yamahaalex-brb>
[15:24:09] <helpcrypto> define "active"
[15:24:15] <necromancer> you can do stuff like <?php if ($someCondition) { ?><div id="message">sup</div><?php } ?>
[15:24:42] <necromancer> helpcrypto: another way to test if elements are included in the page is by just doing $('#your-element') in console
[15:24:56] <necromancer> it should return an actual object, if it returns [] the element doesn't exist on the page
[15:25:07] <LordThumper> helpcrypto: No, I will try to explain my problem
[15:25:38] <LordThumper> I am trying to open a FancyBox not by attaching it to a link but during code execution if a condition is met
[15:25:43] <andrew9183> can you do one() without an event ?
[15:25:48] <LordThumper> However the only solutions i found was by attaching it to a link
[15:26:02] <LordThumper> So I tried creating a link and firing that with Jquery using .trigger('click')
[15:26:09] <LordThumper> However that isn't working either
[15:26:09] <helpcrypto> necromancer: thats not the issue. im writing the code from php DOM, so my js is poisoned with some <![[CDATA
[15:26:28] <helpcrypto> FancyBox= ??
[15:26:30] <necromancer> helpcrypto: oh you're using the dom functions in php to write your code?
[15:26:34] <necromancer> yeah don't do that either lol
[15:26:38] <helpcrypto> necromancer: thats the point
[15:26:43] <necromancer> bad idea
[15:26:43] <LordThumper> http://fancybox.net/
[15:26:53] <helpcrypto> necromancer: :(
[15:27:14] <gnarf> dont include JS directly in the html, reference external JS files
[15:27:21] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: give me an example to open a fancybox
[15:27:27] <helpcrypto> (link , js or whatever)
[15:27:59] <necromancer> helpcrypto: you don't need to do that, it's actually adding extra overhead to PHP...
[15:28:01] <gnarf> helpcrypto: too lazy to click on the "how to" ??? http://fancybox.net/howto
[15:28:32] <LordThumper> ok I will create an example in pastebin
[15:28:34] <yamahaalex-brb> <yamahaalex-brb> is there a way i can detect if a canvas is active
[15:30:11] <yamahaalex-brb> im not really sure what to search for that...
[15:31:24] <helpcrypto> gnarf: no...its not my code, and im going to chow him how its done
[15:31:34] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: better in jsfiddle
[15:32:17] <LordThumper> http://pastebin.com/pCyYcVkm
[15:32:30] <LordThumper> Ok ill clone it in jsfiddle
[15:33:57] <helpcrypto> after helping yopu, im going to be, so please, be fast
[15:34:18] <helpcrypto> necromancer: solved. i was using saveXML instead of saveHTML
[15:34:31] <helpcrypto> someone said code blindness?

[15:45:22] <helpcrypto> ok
[15:45:27] <helpcrypto> than its working for me
[15:45:31] <LordThumper> Yes
[15:45:36] <helpcrypto> when i click, i see a fancybox
[15:45:41] <helpcrypto> now....what do you want?
[15:45:41] <LordThumper> I need to launch that popup without clicking a link
[15:45:46] <helpcrypto> ok
[15:45:49] <helpcrypto> on which event?
[15:46:16] <helpcrypto> "when" are you going to show the box?
[15:46:34] <LordThumper> Ok, user click a button, an if statement is done
[15:46:41] <LordThumper> if it passes the fancybox should be displayed
[15:46:47] <helpcrypto> ok...hold a sec
[15:46:53] <LordThumper> ok
[15:50:41] <helpcrypto> LordThumper: do you know what function is invoked on #fancy?

[16:00:53] <LordThumper> Try to find some optimisation tools
[16:01:05] <LordThumper> But IE9 will still be faster than current Chrome

[16:12:59] <Snerf> I am using a $.ajax call and get json data, in success function.. if I alert(response) it looks like proper json data, but when I use $.each() on it, I get a jquery error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[16:14:17] <prabh> hi
[16:14:29] <prabh> can any one tell me how jquery works
[16:16:03] <Snerf> prabh, go to website and read the documentation
[16:16:19] <LordThumper> By magic I think
[16:16:38] <prabh> ohk
[16:16:41] <prabh> i got it
[16:17:07] <award85> I used the scientific method to determine how jquery works, and LordThumper is actually correct: magic.
[16:17:28] <VooDooNOFX_> I've got 2 calls to load jQuery happening on some pages of a web application that's sort of out of my control. How can I ensure the second load doesn't clobber the defined addons to the first load?
[16:17:40] <Snerf> could it be that I am trying to use $.each on json which is not an array?
[16:18:04] <LordThumper> Same jQuery or different versions?
[16:18:32] <VooDooNOFX_> LordThumper, same.
[16:18:44] <VooDooNOFX_> well, I think. :)
[16:19:04] <LordThumper> Well than you don't have a problem
[16:19:06] <LordThumper> I think
[16:19:08] <LordThumper> :P
[16:19:45] <LordThumper> I don't think a browser makes multiple requests for the same resource
[16:21:06] <LordThumper> Or you could tell the other developers to just remove the extra loads?
[16:21:21] <LordThumper> And use Google API to load jQuery
[16:21:34] <LordThumper> http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[16:22:56] <VooDooNOFX_> LordThumper, That's the issue. It's loading 2 seperate jQuery libs from 2 parts of the site. One is a site-wide jQuery call using Google's loaders, but that happens at the start of the body
[16:23:09] <VooDooNOFX_> Sometimes, jerks inject another jQuery call at the bottom of the head tag
[16:23:56] <LordThumper> I see. Asp.net?
[16:26:41] <LordThumper> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1356279/prevent-jquery-multiple-reference
[16:27:11] <LordThumper> That loads jQuery if it hasn't been loaded yet
[16:27:46] <LordThumper> Either that or punish the developers when they try to add jQuery
[16:32:51] <Snerf> I am using a $.ajax call and get json data, in success function.. if I alert(response) it looks like proper json data, but when I use $.each() on it, I get a jquery error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined. Could this because response is not an array ?
[16:34:14] <chovy_> Snerf: yes
[16:34:34] <Snerf> well, thats a pain in the neck.. it looks like an array..
[16:34:50] <mansoor> Snerf: jqury comes with json parsing method, you can use that
[16:34:53] <chovy> Snerf: got an example?
[16:35:14] <chovy> you could paste the response in jsonlint too and be sure it's valid json.
[16:36:05] <LekeFly> Can i use jQuery to transform a dropdown (option/select) into lis? :s
[16:36:05] <Snerf> oh. didnt know of a website for that.. let me see
[16:37:00] <Snerf> yes, its valid..
[16:38:29] <Snerf> so it should response.data 'should' be an array.. but its not..
[16:42:46] <mansoor> Snerf: what is its type?  typeof (var)
[16:42:56] <PPaul> i have a select box, when i do $("#sbox").val() i get it's selected value. is there a way for me to get other attributes from the selected item? (tried .attr('name') and it doesn't work)
[16:43:15] <Snerf> well, not for some reason its spitting out invalid json error.. something broke.. grr..
[16:43:25] <Snerf> s/not/now
[16:44:35] <PPaul> halp
[16:44:57] <Snerf> oops.. cuz I logged out..
[16:47:46] <Snerf> mansoor, type string
[16:49:13] <mansoor> Snerf: use firebug(or eqv.) to capture the incoming information and validate that with jsonlint, i have a feeling the server is sending you malformed json
[16:49:14] <ragas> var els = document.querySelectorAll("ul li:nth-child(odd)"); Is jQuery becoming part of html5 or is it just borrowing from it?
[16:49:26] <Snerf> mansoor, its valid JSON
[16:49:35] <Snerf> according to that website
[16:49:49] <mansoor> Snerf: try running http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[16:50:56] <Snerf> oh.. gotcha.. because it should be type 'object', shouldnt it?
[16:51:16] <Jhelpme> can someone help me for a moment, im trying to get my slider to work and I cant figure out why it is not working to save my life
[16:51:55] <Snerf> ah, perfect...response = JSON.parse(response); worked like a charm
[16:52:16] <Snerf> ok.. and my hairline receeded about 1" there..sheesh
[16:55:54] <Jhelpme> someone?
[16:56:17] <Snerf> just ask dude.. dont ask to ask
[16:56:42] <Jhelpme> glad someone is paying attention to me
[16:58:11] <Snerf> you dont need to hold your hand up to ask a question, ask it or be ignored
[16:58:41] <Jhelpme> im trying to make my slider work this is my url but it isnt working for some reason http://dev.usbuildingdigest.com/
[16:59:22] <aaairc> if i wanted to add a calendar similar to the one shown here: http://www.zvents.com/z/los_angeles_ca/iris-from-cirque-du-soleil--events--195073366#tickets, that would be a fairly large calendar that could be populated with date/times of events as shown in the link, would anyone recommend a specific plugin?
[17:00:12] <Jhelpme> aaairc i think they have one at htmldrive.net
[17:00:37] <aaairc> Jhelpme: checking it out
[17:00:44] <Snerf> what doesnt work?
[17:01:01] <Jhelpme> you see the big image under the nav
[17:01:04] <Jhelpme> that doesnt work
[17:01:14] <Jhelpme> its suppose to be switching images
[17:01:22] <Eviltwin> ragas: jQuery's query syntax is taken from Sizzle, the selector engine that powers it
[17:01:37] <Eviltwin> ragas: Sizzle's syntax is a supserset of full CSS3 selectors
[17:01:38] <Jhelpme> its using nivo slider but stupid thing may be clashing with something and i have no idea what it is
[17:03:34] <ragas> so, when someone asks about my css3 familiarity, those selectors are a good chunk of what they are referring to, eviltiwn?
[17:03:41] <ragas> eviltwin
[17:04:04] <Eviltwin> Not really
[17:04:25] <Eviltwin> These are the CSS3 selectors: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/
[17:04:40] <Eviltwin> But there's a hell of a lot more to CSS3
[17:05:00] <Jhelpme> any ideas Snerf?
[17:05:05] <Eviltwin> Like animations, MathML etc
[17:08:41] <dogarrhea2> hrm. why does animate make .css("top") and the inline style on google chrome differ?
[17:11:47] <Edler> hey guys
[17:11:53] <Edler> how can i catch a browser back button event
[17:12:05] <Edler> do to event.preventDefault() and do whatever i want then
[17:12:27] <FerchoLP> Do you know if http://slidesjs.com/ would work with swf files instead of images?
[17:12:54] <Eviltwin> Edler: You can't generally
[17:13:06] <Edler> if i'm making an ajax based webapp
[17:13:06] <Eviltwin> It's not a feature of the document or window
[17:13:10] <Edler> and i want that when the guy clicks back
[17:13:17] <Edler> i want to capture it and do something accordinfly
[17:13:19] <Edler> accordingly
[17:13:21] <aaairc> Can anyone recommend a plugin that would make it easy to replicate this calendar:  http://www.zvents.com/z/los_angeles_ca/i-love-lucy-los-angeles--events--210848145#tickets
[17:13:25] <Edler> am i forced to use the history states ?
[17:13:39] <Eviltwin> Or hashes
[17:13:48] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[17:13:58] <Edler> thanks
[17:14:11] <Eviltwin> That's limited to certain modern browsers though
[17:14:16] <Eviltwin> Won't work in IE6 etc.
[17:14:33] <Edler> IE6 is gone
[17:14:38] <Eviltwin> No, no it's not
[17:14:42] <Eviltwin> We all wish it was
[17:14:51] <Edler> it is
[17:15:02] <Edler> http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/springboard/archive/2011/12/15/ie-auto-updates-good-news-for-businesses-too.aspx
[17:15:26] <Eviltwin> Edler: http://static.arstechnica.com/11-01-2011/browser-stats/internet-explorer-transition.png
[17:15:42] <Edler> check the new microsoft blogpost
[17:15:55] <Edler> automatic update for IE6 IE7, plus it's silent like chrome
[17:15:59] <Edler> so now we start at IE8
[17:16:23] <Eviltwin> So, what? If they open IE6 they now magically get upgraded to IE8?
[17:16:34] <Edler> http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/microsoft-decides-to-automatically-update-internet-explorer-for-everyone-20111215/
[17:16:34] <Eviltwin> Don't they still need to install the update?
[17:16:42] <Edler> it's automatic and silent
[17:16:46] <Edler> at least that's what i read
[17:17:00] <Edler> i know that you can install a toolkit to prevent it from upgrading
[17:17:02] <Edler> for enterprises
[17:17:05] <Edler> who rely on ie6
[17:17:14] <Edler> "And so from now on, Internet Explorer will quietly update itself just as Windows does. Starting in January, users in Australia and Brazil will be the begin receiving automatic IE updates. Microsoft will then gradually extend coverage to other parts of the world as time goes on."
[17:17:25] <Eviltwin> So without authorizing it, my computer is going to go out and automatically replace installed software because Microsoft flipped a switch at their headquarters?
[17:17:32] <snover> I hope so
[17:17:41] <snover> fuck you if you are still running IE.ancient :)
[17:17:42] <Edler> well considering you have a valid windows liscence
[17:17:49] <Edler> and have not completely disabled windows update
[17:18:00] <Eviltwin> That's shockingly dangerous
[17:18:14] <Edler> most dumbasses old IE6 using people have windows update on
[17:18:24] <Edler> because they are afraid of getting viruses blablabla
[17:18:34] <Edler> so it will update for them to IE8 on XP and IE9 on Vista+
[17:18:53] <snover> Eviltwin: what are you kidding me?
[17:18:55] <snover> how is it dangerous?
[17:19:10] <Edler> :D "With today?s internet threat landscape, there?s no question that using an outdated browser is a fool?s errand. And you won?t find a web developer anywhere who?s sad to learn that Internet Explorer 6 (and even 7) will soon disappear from Windows XP machines around the globe."
[17:19:51] <Eviltwin> snover: Having my computer download and execute arbitrary code from Microsoft without any action from me?
[17:20:01] <Eviltwin> Works as long as that code is flawless
[17:20:05] <Edler> it's installing an update from windows update center
[17:20:07] <Eviltwin> And let's face it
[17:20:09] <Eviltwin> It's Microsoft
[17:20:13] <Eviltwin> The ones who made IE
[17:20:18] <Eviltwin> Which is nowhere near flawless
[17:20:23] <Edler> but marked as urgent and high important
[17:20:28] <Edler> so you won't be prompted to decline
[17:20:33] <Edler> unless you disabled update all together
[17:20:39] <kborchers> guarantee all large corps still on xp/ie7 are working on plans to roll those blocking tools out as we speak to prevent the upgrade :(
[17:20:56] <Eviltwin> Probabl
[17:20:57] <Eviltwin> y
[17:20:59] <Edler> yeah M$ released that toolkit
[17:21:07] <Edler> so those enterprises can block the upgrade
[17:21:09] <Edler> ll
[17:21:12] <Eviltwin> There are plenty of things that work in IE6 that don't work in newer versions
[17:21:22] <Eviltwin> Because they were designed using all of that IE6-specific bullshit
[17:21:28] <Edler> "he Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 Automatic Update Blocker toolkits prevent automatic upgrades of IE for Windows customers who do not want them"
[17:21:43] <snover> Eviltwin: I assume you don’t ever update anything then
[17:21:50] <snover> because that happens every single time you run windows update
[17:21:51] <snover> or google chrome
[17:22:44] <snover> or when you turn on your xbox
[17:22:56] <Eviltwin> At least for the Xbox it asks me
[17:23:12] <snover> and you say no every time, right?
[17:23:28] <Eviltwin> Sometimes I do
[17:23:38] <Eviltwin> And usually the worst that happens is I can't go on Xbox Live
[17:24:09] <Eviltwin> I like to have heard a lot of success stories about an upgrade before I apply it myself
[17:24:12] <snover> seems worse than the alternative, which is to do the update and then everything still works
[17:24:29] <Eviltwin> There have been upgrades that break shit in a profound way
[17:25:27] <snover> but you update anyway eventually because you have to in order to use xbox live
[17:25:38] <Guest40600> I just want to play skyrim
[17:25:43] <Guest40600> for the rest of my life, until the day i die
[17:26:20] <snover> play skyrim nonstop without sleeping for a week and your wish will be fulfilled
[17:26:22] <Guest40600> i married my girlfriend - big mistake, i should have married skyrim
[17:26:48] <Guest40600> snover: good idea. but i don't have time. i have to work, to pay for skyrim.
[17:27:19] <snover> it’s only a week! just start on your payday.
[17:28:20] <Guest40600> i would be too stressed about work
[17:28:23] <Guest40600> even knowing i was going to die
[17:28:26] <Guest40600> i'd still be stressed
[17:28:31] <Guest40600> i wish they would make a jquery version of skyrim
[17:28:41] <Guest40600> i wish jquery were called jskyrim
[17:30:00] <imsky> abjorn: wat
[17:30:08] <imsky> wat is this new twitters about you emo bastard
[17:30:22] <abjorn> http://rt.com/usa/news/indefinite-detention-bill-senate-905/
[17:30:23] <abjorn> dat
[17:30:28] <abjorn> iMad
[17:30:41] <freenodiz> hi,i'm flash/action script veteran.just started using jquery.My interest is mostly using this type of functions: function animate_element(){ $("#element").animate({left:"+=100px"},1000).animate({left:"-=100px"}, 1000)  setTimeout("element()",2000);}  .I would use Catalyst,to apply such animation.Is there some app to help me explore this side of jquery?not talking about li's or links,etc...
[17:30:43] <imsky> haha
[17:30:44] <imsky> obama
[17:30:49] <abjorn> ^
[17:31:08] <abjorn> "Change! Progress!"
[17:31:10] <abjorn> rly nao
[17:31:47] <dogarrhea2> so what exactly is animate doing?
[17:31:54] <dogarrhea2> i see some inline style in developer tools
[17:32:02] <imsky> i thought you were mad that the iraq war ended
[17:32:26] <imsky> right before election season >_>
[17:32:46] <freenodiz> is there a GUI for jquery "animation" style like action script ,catalyst?
[17:34:28] <freenodiz> i have one app to animate css3 :)
[17:34:38] <freenodiz> exchange links?lol
[17:37:02] <dogarrhea2> bah why does console.log(element.css("top")) give a different value than what is shown inline in developer tools?
[17:37:08] <dogarrhea2> this happens when i animate. Bug?
[17:37:17] <imsky> abjorn: one term president
[17:37:34] <abjorn> fosho
[17:39:04] <imsky> though it's just senate so far
[17:39:07] <imsky> wat about congress
[17:39:39] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Can you make a jsFiddle example illustrating this "bug"?
[17:39:39] <imsky> oh wait
[17:40:10] <imsky> house already voted, daaamn
[17:40:25] <dogarrhea2> i will try later Eviltwin.. dont wanna spend too much time now
[17:40:39] <freenodiz> somenthing like http://www.sencha.com ,but to edit jquery,as an "artistic" action script like animation?
[17:41:05] <Eviltwin> imsky: http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=144591
[17:41:24] <imsky> what's this
[17:43:48] <imsky> i haven't clicked on it, so it's not self-evident to me
[17:44:12] <Eviltwin> Oh, disregard
[17:44:23] <imsky> yeah i usually will disregard you from now on
[17:44:53] <Eviltwin> Fine by me
[17:46:14] <imsky> abjorn: i'm reading that clause in the bill, doesn't seem to be too broad
[17:47:15] <imsky> "a covered person under this section is either a) someone who helped with 9/11 or b) terrist, or terrist-related lifeforms"
[18:00:54] <td123> Hi, I'm trying to save and load a sortable element's order. I see that I can save the order using serialize, but how would I load the resulting string?
[18:03:35] <imsky> td123: where are you saving the string to
[18:05:18] <td123> imsky: database
[18:05:33] <Eviltwin> Use JSON instead? :D
[18:05:38] <imsky> awesome. so do you know about .get() or .post()?
[18:06:07] <Eviltwin> Is your question about getting the string into the browser or, once you have the string, using it to arrange the sortable?
[18:07:26] <td123> basically, once I have the string, how would I load it?
[18:08:09] <imsky> wat
[18:08:19] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you've chosen to use the .serialize() method for storing it?
[18:10:37] <td123> Eviltwin: I'm kind of a noob :P
[18:10:54] <td123> no reason, and if there's another way to do what I'm trying to do please let me know
[18:11:14] <td123> imsky: no I never used .get or .post
[18:11:25] <imsky> how do you store it in database then?
[18:12:05] <td123> imsky: I haven't coded it yet, I'm trying to figure how to save and load it
[18:12:08] <wpsmith> I have a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/wpsmith/Zvedm/ which I am trying to add disabled to the submit button and enable it after the person scrolls through my readonly textarea.
[18:12:20] <imsky> td123: gotcha buddy, good luck
[18:13:47] <wpsmith> any help?
[18:14:11] <imsky> wpsmith: let me guess, are you a rails guy?
[18:14:19] <td123> imsky: thanks, I'm trying to find the get and post functions, initially they looked like the http actions, but it seems they might be doing something else :)
[18:14:33] <dogarrhea2> is it possible to set via position()?
[18:15:06] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: ?
[18:15:11] <Eviltwin> You mean use .position as a setter
[18:15:15] <dogarrhea2> yea
[18:15:35] <Eviltwin> Don't believe so
[18:15:38] <Eviltwin> see ?.position
[18:15:38] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[18:15:51] <someprimetime> without using jquery ui, is it possible to not have that "flicker" which happens when trying to fade in an addClass()?
[18:15:51] <Eviltwin> However I think .offset has a setter
[18:15:57] <Eviltwin> see ?.offset
[18:15:57] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[18:16:09] <wpsmith> imsky no, trying to learn jquery and AJAX but I am a PHP guy. for some jquery eludes me
[18:16:25] <wpsmith> for some reason jquery eludes me
[18:16:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Well you can't actually fade a class without CSS3 animations
[18:17:11] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: So jQuery and jQuery UI "fake" their animations
[18:17:14] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what do you think the best way to handle it would be?
[18:17:27] <someprimetime> ah hm
[18:17:34] <Eviltwin> My many times per second updating to be approximately what it would look like at that time
[18:17:41] <Eviltwin> For example if you fadeOut
[18:17:54] <Eviltwin> It sets the opactity to 0.99 then 0.98 then 0.97 etc
[18:18:00] <Eviltwin> Every fraction of a second
[18:18:01] <tw2113> anyone know of a way to remove a <link rel="stylesheet" ...> link from the head tag on click?
[18:18:02] <Eviltwin> Until its faded out
[18:18:13] <tw2113> i know how to append it, but i want to be able to remove it too
[18:18:16] <Eviltwin> td123: You can easily remove it by selecting it and doing .remove()
[18:18:26] <Eviltwin> But that doesn't undo the CSS it added AFAIK
[18:18:38] <Eviltwin> Hence the reason for using "namespace" in CSS
[18:18:50] <tw2113> damn
[18:19:10] <Eviltwin> tw2113: Take a look at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.styleSheets
[18:19:14] <Eviltwin> Might have some insights there
[18:19:26] <Eviltwin> Or on the linked paged
[18:19:27] <tw2113> thanks
[18:19:29] <Eviltwin> pages*
[18:20:19] <wpsmith> does this look correct? $('input[id^="gform_submit_button"]').attr('disabled');
[18:22:14] <wpsmith> does this select all inputs with ids begginning with gform_submit_button? $('input[id^="gform_submit_button"]').attr('disabled');
[18:23:13] <Eviltwin> Should, yes
[18:23:19] <imsky> wpsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/Zvedm/1/
[18:23:40] <td123> oh I realize there might have been some confusion earlier
[18:23:51] <td123> .get and .post are what I thought they were
[18:24:48] <td123> ok, after saving the sortable ordering with .serialize, is there a similar function which loads the data that serialize outputs?
[18:25:02] <Eviltwin> Can't recall one off hand
[18:25:11] <Eviltwin> I usually see people do it with regular expressions
[18:26:56] <wpsmith> imsky thanks! does that capture all textareas that I may have in the form? I only want to grab those which begin with the id "tos"
[18:27:28] <imsky> wpsmith: you can modify the selectors however you want bud, though you should just probably give your fields a class
[18:35:35] <catcher> I've got a selector running like $('a[href*=URLsegment]')  which works well, but I only want to match links with more after the URLsegment..
[18:35:48] <catcher> Is that doable with a selector? Or do I need a filter/regex?
[18:36:30] <wpsmith> imsky thanks for the tip
[18:36:34] <catcher> I want to match anything that has http://domain/controller/action, but not just http://domain/controller
[18:36:54] <Eviltwin> $('a[href*=URLsegment]:not([href$=URLsegment])')?
[18:37:16] <catcher> Eviltwin, Ah, I like - can I do multiple :nots though? Some may have a trailing slash..
[18:37:17] <Eviltwin> BTW, when []'s and pseudo selectors get involved, queries frequently end up getting slow
[18:37:25] <Eviltwin> Sure, go for it
[18:37:44] <catcher> Eviltwin, slowness could be a factor, is there a better approach?
[18:38:10] <toastyghost> give them different classes when you render the page
[18:38:20] <toastyghost> select by .class:not(.other-class)
[18:38:24] <catcher> Oh how I wish I could :)
[18:38:36] <toastyghost> well that's a bummer
[18:38:41] <Eviltwin> Depending on the browser $('a').filter(function(){/*return true/false depending on whether it's a link I want or not*/})... might be faster
[18:39:20] <Eviltwin> Every operator you add to the selector means it has to apply another filter
[18:39:24] <toastyghost> you can use jsperf.com to compare speed of different methods
[18:39:25] <Eviltwin> And it applies the filters in serial
[18:39:29] <Eviltwin> That's what I suggest
[18:39:35] <Eviltwin> And it may vary by browser
[18:39:47] <Eviltwin> Although with a :not() in there it probably needs to rely on Sizzle
[18:40:08] <catcher> aha..
[18:51:09] <Eviltwin> Looks like the selector's actually winning in this case
[18:52:52] <Eviltwin> Except in Chrome...
[18:54:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsperf.com/crazy-selectors
[18:54:43] <Eviltwin> And the filter was optimized
[18:55:28] <Guest40094> Hey, I need help, I got a div with  a css of display:none; and height:50px; and when I hover over it it doesnt' show with my jquery code
[18:56:18] <Eviltwin> Guest40094: Good thing you showed us your jQuery code so we can see where the problem is :P
[18:56:27] <Guest40094> Oh sorry
[18:58:07] <Guest40094> http://jsfiddle.net/AYPDX/
[18:58:24] <Eviltwin> Okay, do you know what display:none does?
[18:58:43] <Guest40094> Something like that, Yeah, makes it invisible and takes 0 room
[18:58:49] <Guest40094> No room up
[18:59:02] <Guest40094> But thats what I want
[18:59:06] <Eviltwin> http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/f/blfaqhidden.htm
[18:59:17] <Eviltwin> So you want to hover over something that takes up no room
[18:59:18] <Eviltwin> And have it show
[18:59:26] <Eviltwin> How exactly are you going to hover over something that takes up no room?
[18:59:26] <Guest40094> Yes, for now
[18:59:32] <Guest40094> I might change it later
[18:59:43] <Guest40094> but I want to know how to do it this way
[18:59:59] <Eviltwin> Give me a number that's greater than 2 and less than 1
[19:00:13] <Guest40094> 1.75
[19:00:20] <Eviltwin> That's not greather than 2 or less than 1
[19:00:43] <Guest40094> oh opps, there isn't one
[19:00:49] <Eviltwin> Correct
[19:00:53] <Guest40094> so there isn't a way of doning this
[19:00:53] <Eviltwin> And when you set display:none
[19:01:04] <Eviltwin> There's literally nothing you can hover over to hover over the display: none element
[19:02:43] <Eviltwin> So what do you want them to hover over to make the buttons appear?
[19:03:02] <Eviltwin> It needs to be something that takes up space
[19:03:05] <Eviltwin> It doesn't make sense otherwise
[19:03:09] <Eviltwin> Do you follow?
[19:03:26] <Eviltwin> You can't hover over something that doesn't take up any space
[19:05:13] <jquery102> EvilTwin: I;m back
[19:05:34] <jquery102> I'm the one with visibility/display problem
[19:05:52] <Eviltwin> Did you see my follow up questions?
[19:06:06] <jquery102> No
[19:06:20] <Eviltwin> What do you want them to hover over to make the buttons appear?
[19:06:22] <Eviltwin> You can't hover over something that doesn't take up any space
[19:07:04] <jquery102> the area if the btns
[19:07:26] <jquery102> of the btns
[19:07:42] <Eviltwin> But the buttons don't have any area, remember?
[19:07:45] <Eviltwin> They have display:none
[19:07:50] <Eviltwin> So they don't take up any area
[19:07:59] <Eviltwin> Which is where the dilemma comes in
[19:08:09] <jquery102> Will I set that to visibility hidden then
[19:08:24] <jquery102> *I will
[19:09:55] <jquery102> so
[19:09:56] <Eviltwin> I think you might want to do opacity: 0
[19:10:02] <Eviltwin> And then set it to opacity: 1 when you hover
[19:10:07] <jquery102> oh ok
[19:10:15] <Eviltwin> I don't think hover events trigger on visibility: hidden elements
[19:10:18] <Eviltwin> Even though they do take up space
[19:40:01] <tw2113> would anyone know why added CSS links stop responding after using a plugin that alters the font size in the dom?
[19:40:19] <tw2113> or point me in a direction that would help solve this?
[19:44:06] <tw2113> basically i'm trying to add some accessibility to a site in two ways. First way being with a basic plugin that increases font size manually, the 2nd being adding a css <link> to the head and having the CSS in it override the default
[19:44:15] <tw2113> if i use the manual font resizing first, the <link> doesn't apply like expected
[20:33:32] <dnsdds> I have an array of homogeneous objects. How can I remove duplicates?
[20:47:40] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: Are they comparable with == ?
[20:49:38] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: http://jsfiddle.net/TYm4R/
[20:49:41] <dnsdds> Eviltwin: Hmm... why yes they are
[20:50:19] <dnsdds> Intriguing... thanks, Eviltwin!
[20:51:29] <Eviltwin> Do you understand what's happening there?
[20:54:19] <dnsdds> If previous object is a duplicate of current object, do not pass go, do not collect $200 and move back one space(s)
[20:55:07] <Eviltwin> Splice it out of the array, move back, then the for loop advances us forward so we're checking the same index again
[20:56:54] <dnsdds> That's pretty primo
[20:57:43] <dnsdds> Would it be easy to plug this into the Array.prototype as a function?
[20:58:11] <Eviltwin> You could do that although I consider it a bad practice to manipulate the prototypes of built-ins
[20:58:15] <danzik17> Eviltwin: that'll only work on a sorted array unless im mistaken, right?
[20:58:36] <Eviltwin> That loop solution I have, yes
[20:58:53] <Eviltwin> It can be made to work on unsorted ones though
[20:58:56] <Eviltwin> But will take longer
[20:59:28] <Eviltwin> I believe in (almost) every browser, the .sort() isn't actually done by JavaScript
[20:59:29] <danzik17> yea, generally i use a separate object to track "seen" elements
[20:59:46] <Eviltwin> That's one solution however it only works on string-able items
[20:59:57] <Eviltwin> You won't be making a unique set of DOM elements that way any time soon
[21:00:09] <dnsdds> But would it actually sort it, since it's, y'know, objects and not numbers?
[21:00:13] <danzik17> depends on your solution - generally anything i'm operating on has some property that i can consider to be unique
[21:00:23] <danzik17> so i sort and filter on that prop
[21:00:36] <Eviltwin> I don't like to deal in generallys
[21:00:53] <Eviltwin> And I like to write my code to not be specific to one use case
[21:02:38] <danzik17> if thats your style, go for it.  underscore's _.uniq essentially does the same thing
[21:04:24] <Eviltwin> danzik17: http://jsperf.com/uniquify-2
[21:06:34] <danzik17> Eviltwin: thats a pretty small case though - does that perf case hold true when you have hundreds or thousands objects that need to be sorted and then filtered? ( which is generally what i'm working with when i am trying to get distinct sets )
[21:07:47] <Eviltwin> Something to play with
[21:08:01] <Eviltwin> The thing is that an object requires a hashtable lookup
[21:08:28] <Eviltwin> Where as an array only requires addition to find the address of the element
[21:08:37] <danzik17> pick your poison, hash table lookups or a potentially large and expensive sort
[21:08:43] <danzik17> i really don't know which is worse
[21:09:18] <Eviltwin> I added another method so I'm rerunning the test cases
[21:09:23] <Eviltwin> Then I'll fork and use a larger data set
[21:09:46] <danzik17> if your method is faster ill definitely be replacing my implementation - not too happy with the speed of it
[21:10:37] <danzik17> but that said, probably 80% of the performance issues occur when making the DOM elements out of the resulting array which is why i never spent much time on it
[21:26:06] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Interesting results: http://jsperf.com/uniquify-2/3
[21:26:31] <Eviltwin> Still relies on a .toString
[21:26:55] <danzik17> Eviltwin: yep :)  which one relies on a toString?
[21:27:04] <danzik17> seen & push?
[21:27:39] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:28:01] <Eviltwin> All object keys must be strings
[21:28:03] <danzik17> depends on what you're comparing against.  consider something like { name: "foo", id: 1 }
[21:28:08] <danzik17> id being the unique thing
[21:28:30] <danzik17> although i miswrote that, id in my case is passed down as a string in my actual implementation
[21:28:32] <Eviltwin> So your uniquify would have to know to look at item.id
[21:28:50] <Eviltwin> And if you have a function for that, it means another function call
[21:28:57] <danzik17> it does.  that's how i wrote it, and later found out that _.uniq does the same thing
[21:29:18] <danzik17> wait why is this another function call?
[21:29:49] <danzik17> if i want to filter on complex objects, i pass a property name to the function so it looks at the appropriate prop
[21:29:54] <danzik17> no additional funcs
[21:31:43] <Eviltwin> So you can only sort on that particular property
[21:31:47] <Eviltwin> Meaning if you have DOM elements
[21:31:54] <Eviltwin> You need to go through and assign them a unique property
[21:36:07] <danzik17> that's true.  i havent had a need for that to this point that i can think of.
[21:37:27] <danzik17> any kind of unique operation is generally operating on a list of emails or ids, or some other complex object - i can't think of a time i've needed to do an operation like that on DOM elements.
[21:37:42] <danzik17> (in my case, not saying for all cases of course)
[21:37:53] <Eviltwin> Right
[21:38:02] <Eviltwin> And the best solution for any case is the best solution for that case
[21:38:10] <Eviltwin> Regardless of how similar it is to a more abstract notion
[22:46:13] <dnsdds> Is there some clean way to make sure with jQuery that two adjacent divs are the same height at all times, even if the inner content changes, or the div size gets animated or anything else?
[22:56:27] <MeirD> hey
[22:56:46] <MeirD> how do I add an attribute to an object based on a string? i.e. obj.set("attribute_name","value") ?
[22:57:06] <MeirD> (a javascript object, not a DOM element)
[22:58:24] <coldhead> MeirD: obj["lol"] = "aids" ?
[22:58:50] <coldhead> ?eval obj = {}; obj["lol"] = "aids"; obj.lol
[22:58:52] <bot-t> coldhead: "aids"
[22:58:57] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[22:58:58] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:59:08] <coldhead> fascinating
[23:36:32] <FearMoth> if i set var data = $(this).data({title: 'title!'}); should I be able to use alert($(this).data('title')); ? it just says 'undefined
[23:36:35] <FearMoth> am i doing this wrong?
[23:37:01] <coldhead> .data('title', 'title!')
[23:37:27] <coldhead> if you do data({foo:bar}) is takes {foo:bar} to be the key, and you're not passing a value
[23:37:34] <coldhead> it expects 2 arguments for setting
[23:37:40] <coldhead> key comma value
[23:39:02] <FearMoth> howcome I can have var data = { title: 'title!', something: 'something!' }; $(this).data(data); and then once i load it up with data = $(this).data(); alert(data.title); it seems to work?
[23:40:35] <coldhead> wow, that works?
[23:40:42] <coldhead> sorry, it's my first day using jQuery
[23:40:55] <Eviltwin> This is bizarre: http://jsperf.com/crazy-selectors
[23:40:56] <coldhead> if that's the case then your example should work
[23:41:22] <FearMoth> it seems to, i was just reading on the .data() doc page that the keys and values should both be quoted so i'll give that a shot
[23:42:53] <dr0id> its my first hour using jQuery
[23:47:12] <coldhead> right, fuck all this then
[23:47:20] <coldhead> have good weekends, you y'all
[23:48:52] <purefusion2> how come I can't find any description on the "swing" easing function? I'm curious how it differs from linear, because I don't see a noticeable difference... at least not when using with fadeIn()
[23:49:32] <purefusion2> or maybe it's just not working for me? :\
[23:50:15] <purefusion2> well, now I've tried it with slideDown() and still not seeing any noticeable difference between it and the default: http://pinkcocoon.com/
[23:50:30] <purefusion2> SFW :P
[23:52:56] <woozly> guys, which plugin for number picker? with arrows up&down
[23:55:54] <Zogot> Morning all
