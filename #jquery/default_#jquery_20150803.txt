[00:52:20] <poko> Hi. I need a solution to a little problem with DataTables. Problem is that I have multiple data-tables on one page with same columns structure and on changing hidden/shown state of columns I need to hide/show columns on every table... Is there a reliable solution to this issue?
[00:54:45] <limpep> Hi, I am having trouble getting to parse a json string with highcharts, https://jsfiddle.net/mxz5cgxr/16/
[01:32:03] <Whiskey> does jQuery has any hash it can generate from content
[01:32:24] <Whiskey> it don´t has to be md5 crc32 or anything just a hash for content of some kind,
[01:34:46] <arc_> no, use javascript http://werxltd.com/wp/2010/05/13/javascript-implementation-of-javas-string-hashcode-method/
[01:34:53] <arc_> or similar
[01:35:03] <arc_> pure javascript*
[01:38:35] <arc_> "This demonstrates my lack of understanding hashes probably…but, how do you reverse the process. Once you’ve converted the string to a hash, how do you turn it back into a string?"
[01:38:37] <arc_> HAHA
[01:46:03] <Whiskey> hehe

[04:09:37] <Abhijit> how can I troubleshoot why my <button> on click event not working?
[04:10:11] <taplar> check your console for errors.  console log in your event handler
[04:10:19] <taplar> console log before you bind the event
[04:10:22] <taplar> various things
[04:10:50] <Abhijit> i have console log inside it which is the only statement and it do not print anything on console.
[04:11:05] <Abhijit> the code  is like this $('.clparts').click(function(){
[04:11:11] <taplar> so console log immediately before the bind, giving it what your binding to, to make sure it is being found
[04:11:23] <Abhijit> its the first function in my document ready
[04:11:38] <taplar> is the element created dynamically?
[04:11:41] <Abhijit> yes
[04:11:46] <taplar> so, yes, console log it
[04:12:04] <Abhijit> i put console log before it and it prints.
[04:12:11] <Abhijit> inside it do not work.
[04:12:17] <taplar> it found the element?  length is 1 or >?
[04:12:59] <Abhijit> norc, i mean i wrote like this $(document).ready(function(){console.log("first");$('.clparts').click(function(){ and it prints "first"
[04:13:17] <taplar> console.log($('.clparts'))
[04:13:18] <`ULT> hello, i`m also a beginner in jquery.
[04:13:30] <Abhijit> taplar, thats outside the click function?
[04:13:41] <taplar> doesn't matter.  your verifying that it is created
[04:13:48] <taplar> if your trying to bind before it is created it will not work
[04:14:05] <norc> http://jsfiddle.net/chox1bLt/1/   - I want only the target next to the button to update. Is using proxies a wise idea here?
[04:14:08] <taplar> unless you use a delegate on a preexisting parent
[04:14:17] <Abhijit> taplar, it prints object []
[04:14:28] <taplar> what about
[04:14:33] <taplar> console.log($('.clparts').length)
[04:14:41] <Abhijit> taplar, i first dynamically create it and then write the on click function
[04:14:59] <Abhijit> taplar, length is 0
[04:15:02] <MagePsycho__> jquery mobile or bootstrap for mobile theme development?
[04:15:04] <taplar> it does not exist yet
[04:15:07] <taplar> atleast in the dom
[04:15:13] <Abhijit> let me change position
[04:15:43] <`ULT> I have a toggle and a function and i need that the part in the function is running together with the toggle animation
[04:15:47] <`ULT> look also: http://prntscr.com/80a392
[04:16:04] <Abhijit> taplar, how do I solve this problem?
[04:16:37] <taplar> Abhijit: make sure the element exists before you bind, or use a delegate bind on a pre-existing parent element
[04:16:53] <`ULT> on the api.jquery.com i read something about the start
[04:17:03] <Abhijit> taplar, can i insert first js file which create element and then insert second js file which has on click event?
[04:17:08] <Abhijit> will that work?
[04:17:11] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/80a3xf
[04:17:12] <hellyeah> hey can i construct a table like that https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/4/
[04:17:14] <`ULT> is this what i need?
[04:17:15] <taplar> norc: for yours from your html structure, i'm pretty sure you'll want to find just the target in relation to the button you clicked
[04:17:43] <Abhijit> taplar, actually there are more than 10 such buttons
[04:17:48] <norc> taplar: Except that information is lost in the callback.
[04:17:49] <Abhijit> generated dynamically
[04:18:06] <taplar> norc: you can store the reference to the button clicked and then find off of that in your inner function
[04:18:10] <norc> taplar: Usually Id look at using proxy / bind here, but Im wondering whether Im looking at this from the wrong waz
[04:18:34] <norc> taplar: Okay maybe Im massively confused about scope here..
[04:18:51] <taplar> variables of functions are available to child functions
[04:19:14] <taplar> unless you do something with maybe the let prefix, which i don't use much so i'm not sure there
[04:19:39] <`ULT> can someone look to this? http://prntscr.com/80a392
[04:20:08] <norc> taplar: Ah, its just the this that changes?
[04:20:30] <taplar> you store the this into a variable so you can use it in the inner function
[04:20:55] <hellyeah> inner function is in scope of outer function right
[04:21:46] <taplar> hellyeah: your append nesting is wrong
[04:22:04] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:22:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:22:30] <hellyeah> which line is wrong? all of it?
[04:22:41] <taplar> starting at ln 3
[04:23:07] <taplar> remember, x.append(y) -> x
[04:24:07] <hellyeah> but at the same time x contains y as a child yes?
[04:24:16] <taplar> after the operation, yes
[04:25:04] <hellyeah> so we add tr to thead and th to tr
[04:25:18] <taplar> no
[04:25:21] <hellyeah> but lasly we will have thead they have child tr and child th
[04:25:23] <taplar> your always adding to X
[04:25:37] <hellyeah> X is table in this case right?
[04:25:38] <taplar> untill ln 5
[04:25:41] <taplar> yes
[04:25:58] <hellyeah> hmm i just add tbody to table
[04:26:07] <hellyeah> because tbody is child of table
[04:26:16] <taplar> why are you finding table in table?
[04:26:39] <taplar> append adds children, it does not adjust context
[04:26:41] <hellyeah> hmm someone said append function is just adding element to table
[04:27:00] <taplar> unless you tell it otherwise, append will keep appending to the same element in a chain as the one you started with
[04:27:02] <hellyeah> so i supposed all element i appended will be child of table
[04:27:09] <taplar> thus the x.append(y) -> x designation
[04:27:15] <taplar> yes
[04:27:17] <taplar> as is
[04:27:33] <hellyeah> i mean first degree child
[04:27:43] <taplar> yes
[04:27:53] <hellyeah> all thead tbody tr td th  are in same level?
[04:27:58] <taplar> yep
[04:28:00] <hellyeah> is that like that?
[04:28:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:28:30] <hellyeah> thats not we want i guess
[04:29:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/6/
[04:29:54] <`ULT> hi! Can someone help me with a small problem?
[04:30:20] <taplar> `ULT: just ask.  if we can, we'll pipe up
[04:30:44] <`ULT> yeah, my english (and also my jquery) skills are not that good
[04:31:01] <`ULT> but in this screen my problem is mentioned: http://prntscr.com/80a392
[04:31:02] <taplar> it's ok, i'm a native and mine are not that good either, ^_~
[04:31:51] <hellyeah> this
[04:31:57] <hellyeah> prop function seems useful
[04:32:30] <taplar> according to the documentation, the function your using is called once the animation is done
[04:32:44] <hellyeah> seems wrong
[04:32:48] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/
[04:33:13] <`ULT> yeah, can i use the start option for it?
[04:33:31] <taplar> sure
[04:33:32] <`ULT> i dont know how i can implement that in the function
[04:33:42] <taplar> it won't be in a function like you have it
[04:34:00] <taplar> it will be like .slideToggle({ start: function(){ ... }})
[04:34:28] <`ULT> oke, thanks. I tried something like that before. But maybe i made a syntax error.
[04:34:31] <`ULT> i would try again
[04:34:41] <taplar> your existing function would be provided as done: function(){} if you still wanted something once it's finished
[04:35:17] <`ULT> aah thanks. that sounds understandable
[04:35:24] <`ULT> i would give it a try
[04:41:44] <hellyeah> the result looks so weird i dont understand why it looks like that https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/11/
[04:45:54] <`ULT> hi taplar, it is working almost
[04:46:30] <`ULT> some little questions: how did you know the syntax for that part of code?
[04:46:38] <`ULT> can I read something more about that?
[04:46:51] <taplar> `ULT: i was just going off of the api documentation
[04:46:52] <`ULT> I can`t find that in the api
[04:47:00] <taplar> the second part that talks about options being passed in
[04:47:08] <`ULT> yes, but how can i read that?
[04:47:21] <`ULT> i`m a noob at programming
[04:48:02] <taplar> the second version of the function has options passed in.  below it says options is a PlainObject which in javascript terms just means a {} with key value pairs in it
[04:48:10] <taplar> so each one of the options is a key in the object
[04:48:17] <`ULT> i mean this part: http://prntscr.com/80aewr
[04:48:42] <taplar> what about it?
[04:48:52] <`ULT> i forgat that but i can not find that in the api
[04:48:57] <`ULT> *forgot
[04:49:16] <taplar> it talks about start on the api
[04:50:23] <taplar> if your saying that literal line is not on the api, then that is true
[04:50:35] <`ULT> yes, but how can you know that than? :p
[04:50:47] <`ULT> i can not make the switch from api to correct code
[04:50:50] <taplar> it says start takes a type of Function
[04:50:50] <`ULT> how can i learn that
[04:51:06] <`ULT> aah oke
[04:51:43] <`ULT> that makes something clear
[04:52:16] <taplar> hellyeah: your still always adding all those children to table
[04:52:40] <taplar> your not appending strings
[04:52:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  i realized :D
[04:53:03] <taplar> you also do not have to append the closing tags
[04:53:17] <hellyeah> okey
[04:53:18] <taplar> when you append an html object with jquery it will automatically put the close tag in for you
[04:54:25] <hellyeah> var table = $("<table>") .append("<thead>") .append("<tr>")
[04:54:33] <hellyeah> thead seem closer to me?
[04:54:45] <taplar> huh?
[04:55:25] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[04:55:54] <hellyeah> fot <tr> tag, <thead>seems close to me but it seems it add <tr> to <table> right
[04:56:53] <hellyeah> or may be i got it wrong
[04:57:03] <taplar> everything is being added to table, at least in your last fiddle
[04:57:10] <taplar> nothing is been nested any deeper
[04:57:28] <hellyeah> humm
[04:57:39] <hellyeah> once i remembered yo use .end()
[04:58:00] <hellyeah> but not for this case i think
[04:58:08] <taplar> not yet
[04:58:15] <taplar> your not doing any traversals
[04:58:31] <`ULT> hi tapler, the first part of the code is not working, but by implementing the start: the second part is not working anymore. Look also: http://prntscr.com/80aicm
[04:59:08] <taplar> `ULT: please don't put the red lines, makes it harder to read
[04:59:51] <`ULT> oke
[05:00:01] <taplar> also, could you put that in a jsfiddle.net please?
[05:00:05] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/80aj5r
[05:00:07] <`ULT> yes i would
[05:00:30] <hellyeah> do i  need method?
[05:00:36] <hellyeah> other method?=
[05:01:05] <taplar> hellyeah: if your going to do it all in one statement your going to have to adjust your context with find() and end()
[05:03:30] <`ULT> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/
[05:04:45] <taplar> k
[05:04:56] <taplar> i would think it would always be visible
[05:05:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  am i close? https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/15/
[05:05:04] <taplar> to be able to click on something, it has to be visible
[05:05:36] <taplar> hellyeah: you can't find elements before they exist
[05:05:45] <`ULT> i think i see the problem taplar
[05:05:50] <`ULT> i miss a }
[05:06:14] <`ULT> hmm no that is also not working
[05:06:53] <taplar> `ULT: what are you trying to achieve?
[05:07:43] <hellyeah> i am kinda stucked
[05:08:18] <hellyeah> pls give me little tip :D
[05:08:30] <taplar> why are you stuck?
[05:09:45] <hellyeah> hmm i just have to traverse i mean when i add some tag i need to go down right
[05:10:01] <hellyeah> when i add tr i need to traverse table - thead - tr
[05:10:11] <taplar> right
[05:10:17] <taplar> find() does a traversal
[05:10:19] <hellyeah> when i add th i have to traverse table-thead-tr -th
[05:10:40] <`ULT> when clicking on the link: Klik en selecteer uw uitvoering, toggle content, highlite the row (lightgrey) and changing the link in: klik en verberg opties. (WORKING)
[05:11:18] <hellyeah> i understand
[05:11:26] <hellyeah> after appending element
[05:11:34] <hellyeah> we find that element and we add spesific element
[05:11:37] <hellyeah> a sec
[05:11:42] <`ULT> when clicking on the link: klik en verberg opties. Disable content (working) changing text in klik en selecteer uw uitvoering (NOT working) and chaning the background color to white (not working)
[05:11:43] <taplar> `ULT: first, in your start function, console log $(this) to make sure it is what you think it is
[05:12:26] <taplar> oh
[05:12:37] <taplar> you may actually have just an issue with your css stuff
[05:13:00] <`ULT> no, i dont think that that is the problem. the linktext is also not chaning
[05:13:15] <`ULT> and without start: it is working correct.
[05:13:23] <taplar> ah
[05:13:33] <taplar> so yeah, console log your $(this) to see what it is
[05:13:37] <`ULT> how can i console log? :$
[05:13:46] <taplar> console.log( <whatever> );
[05:14:02] <`ULT> on the end of code?
[05:14:14] <taplar> first line of your start function
[05:14:19] <`ULT> thanks
[05:15:50] <norc> taplar: How does the asynchronous behavior affect the scope of the outer variable? What if it gets changed before the request completes and fires the success callback?
[05:16:19] <hellyeah> getting close https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/17/
[05:16:30] <taplar> 'this' is scoped to that given invocation of your outer event handler
[05:16:59] <taplar> if you mean what if something on the element itself changes, well, that could happen
[05:17:08] <`ULT> you mean this taplar? console.log ($this);
[05:17:25] <taplar> `ULT: wrap your this in parentheses
[05:17:37] <taplar> like you are in your usages
[05:18:34] <`ULT> ofc. yes.
[05:18:42] <`ULT> and know how i can read the log?
[05:19:02] <`ULT> element inspect i guess
[05:20:11] <taplar> yeah, then switch to the console tab
[05:20:37] <hellyeah> so
[05:20:41] <hellyeah> end() method
[05:20:50] <hellyeah> tell i am done with this tag or operation
[05:20:56] <taplar> traversal
[05:20:57] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/80aqui
[05:21:01] <hellyeah> i will work with one above tag or operation?
[05:21:09] <taplar> find().blah().blah().blah().end()
[05:21:22] <hellyeah> i put two end there
[05:21:41] <hellyeah> one end() for th
[05:21:48] <hellyeah> the other end for tr right
[05:21:54] <taplar> `ULT: not the element browser, the console tab
[05:22:02] <taplar> it will print out what you told it to log
[05:22:25] <`ULT> oow haha
[05:22:27] <taplar> hellyeah: i'd have to see your logic again
[05:24:03] <`ULT> taplar, i dont know how exactely i can find the consolelog
[05:24:13] <`ULT> you mean in the element inspectator?
[05:24:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  my logic is just creating table with structure.
[05:24:33] <`ULT> this? http://prntscr.com/80asa4
[05:24:44] <`ULT> or do i need to find another console tab
[05:25:13] <taplar> try clicking that show all messages link
[05:25:32] <taplar> and unclick your preserve log option for now
[05:26:24] <taplar> hellyeah: in this case by logic i mean your append logic
[05:26:35] <hellyeah> humm
[05:26:56] <norc> taplar: Is this a race condition then? http://jsfiddle.net/chox1bLt/3/
[05:27:10] <norc> taplar: Because if it inspects the variable at invocation, this should really be a bad idea
[05:27:19] <hellyeah> x.append(y) is x(root element)->y(child element) this is my logic?
[05:28:22] <`ULT> [tr.more-info, context: tr.more-info]
[05:28:32] <taplar> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/chox1bLt/4/  what are you thinking is wrong with that?
[05:28:42] <taplar> hellyeah: yes
[05:28:51] <hellyeah> this is my logic
[05:29:43] <taplar> `ULT: alright, make sure that is what you want.  also you can do other things to debug.  log your conditional for instance.  see what is happening
[05:30:51] <norc> taplar: By the time the ajax callback is called, .each might have gotten the next element, setting wrap/val to new variables.
[05:30:52] <`ULT> thank you, i think this is very useable. to know how you can log some things.
[05:31:11] <norc> taplar: In fact that would be a rather likely thing considering HTTP, network etc...
[05:31:20] <taplar> norc: when you do the ajax, it makes a copy of what the variable was.  it will not be altered by later iterations
[05:31:36] <taplar> norc: due to how you have it scoped
[05:31:56] <norc> taplar: That sounds like some dark magic right there.
[05:32:03] <taplar> well think about it
[05:32:12] <taplar> your variable is a local variable right?
[05:32:18] <norc> I mean I understand what you are saying.
[05:32:21] <taplar> your each could end before your ajax comes back
[05:32:28] <taplar> which would cause local variables to be deleted
[05:32:35] <taplar> but the ajax still needs it
[05:32:40] <taplar> so it keeps it, :)
[05:33:12] <taplar> next iteration creates a new variable with the same designator, but different meemory all together
[05:33:35] <norc> taplar: At what point is that variable bound? When the local function is built?
[05:33:50] <norc> Or is that actually $.ajax ?
[05:34:13] <taplar> ajax gets its own copy/reference when you create the closure for it's success
[05:36:05] <norc> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/chox1bLt/5/
[05:36:42] <norc> Im trying to figure out what mechanism does this.
[05:36:51] <taplar> your missing all your semicolons, btw
[05:37:08] <`ULT> taplar, how can i log the conditional?
[05:37:37] <taplar> `ULT: console.log( $('your selector).is(':visible') );
[05:37:53] <norc> taplar: It absolutely makes no sense that outer variables get copied into a closure.
[05:38:07] <taplar> why not?  just how javascript works
[05:38:30] <taplar> the variable belongs to the function
[05:38:37] <taplar> the inner function belongs to the same scope
[05:38:42] <hellyeah> is function a variable?
[05:38:44] <taplar> why can't they share variables?
[05:39:32] <`ULT> allright taplar, there is going something wrong, the first click is true, right.
[05:39:45] <`ULT> but when i click again, also true, thats not right.
[05:39:50] <taplar> :)
[05:39:52] <szwetsloot> Hey guys
[05:40:05] <taplar> `ULT: so now you have a starting point to figure out why
[05:40:10] <szwetsloot> Is it possible to make a function in jquery which runs whenever an ajax call starts till it finishes?
[05:40:23] <taplar> szwetsloot: yes
[05:40:23] <szwetsloot> I want to show a loading gif whenever ajax is busy till it is done
[05:40:27] <`ULT> yes hahaha, thanks for your guide.
[05:40:38] <taplar> szwetsloot: there are options for providing before and after functions
[05:40:39] <szwetsloot> taplar: Could you tell me what function to look for?
[05:40:41] <taplar> check the api
[05:40:49] <szwetsloot> taplar: thanks
[05:42:01] <norc> taplar: http://pastie.org/10327376
[05:42:12] <norc> taplar: That conflicts with what you said.
[05:42:31] <taplar> how so?
[05:43:10] <norc> taplar: The closure seems to use a reference to the outer variable, rather than keeping a copy itself.
[05:43:21] <szwetsloot> taplar: Thanks a lot, that is exactly what I needed
[05:43:24] <norc> taplar: If what you said was true, I would expect to see 0 in the log.
[05:43:47] <taplar> it's using the n it has in scope
[05:44:10] <taplar> check my scope, n exist? no
[05:44:15] <taplar> check parent scope, n exist? yes
[05:44:16] <taplar> use it
[05:44:58] <norc> taplar: Im unsure why you are evading the issue here. You claimed closures copy the value of a variable and provide that same value later on, regardless of whether the variable changes.
[05:45:37] <taplar> if the variable is defined in a function with var, it's existance goes no higher than that function
[05:45:47] <taplar> if that function terminates, that variable is also deleted
[05:46:00] <taplar> anything that referenced that variable will still have a reference to it's memory location
[05:46:05] <taplar> so the cleanup will leave it
[05:46:11] <taplar> until it no longer has a reference
[05:46:23] <norc> taplar: Im well aware how GCs work thank you.
[05:46:25] <taplar> an each loop invokes a function multiple times
[05:46:32] <taplar> so each variable is it's own instance
[05:46:35] <norc> Can someone competent please give me some assistance?
[05:46:44] <taplar> i'm not understanding your confusion
[05:47:57] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13784998/js-nested-functions-gain-a-copy-of-the-outer-functions-parameters
[05:49:16] <norc> taplar: Yes, that document is talking about binding, which Im not.
[05:49:53] <taplar> seems like your talking about that.  closues having access to outer variables
[05:51:41] <`ULT> taplar, the problem is in the start
[05:52:27] <`ULT> i think i need to close the toggle, and run it again.
[05:53:31] <`ULT> because the animotion is running, while toggeling, i think the if else is not working correct.
[05:54:15] <taplar> interesting
[05:54:27] <taplar> `ULT: you may have to do your visible check before the toggle
[05:54:31] <taplar> check this out
[05:54:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/2/
[05:55:56] <taplar> so start is probably happening once animation begins, not before
[05:56:55] <Kartagis> Uncaught ReferenceError: getDiscount is not defined
[05:59:04] <taplar> that sux
[05:59:08] <taplar> lol, question?
[06:00:49] <Kartagis> taplar: that fiddle you linked
[06:01:26] <taplar> the last one?
[06:01:41] <Kartagis> aye
[06:02:09] <taplar> i don't see that error
[06:02:25] <taplar> nor do i see getDiscount in the logic...
[06:06:48] <xvure> taplar -  its an inline keyup on the quantity boxes
[06:07:23] <taplar> ah
[06:07:35] <taplar> *shrug* not the issue he was asking about, :)
[06:08:19] <hellyeah> this is preferred way to make a table on js https://jsfiddle.net/ayrL8v3d/20/
[06:08:49] <szwetsloot> taplar: If I place a show even within the beforeSend: function() it does not take effect
[06:08:51] <xvure> Haven't caught up on what was being asked yet; had a great morning wrestling with highcharts
[06:08:53] * xvure sighs
[06:08:55] <szwetsloot> taplar: can you tell me why?
[06:09:07] <szwetsloot> taplar: I'll put my code in a pastebin
[06:09:11] <taplar> szwetsloot: k
[06:09:29] <taplar> hellyeah: not sure there is a preferred way, other than using fragments
[06:09:30] <szwetsloot> http://pastebin.com/CM6tD0BH
[06:09:39] <hellyeah> fragments?
[06:09:43] <hellyeah> what is fragments?
[06:09:44] <taplar> hellyeah: preferred is if it can be built on initial page load by the back end, then do that
[06:09:55] <taplar> hellyeah: building page content with javascript is mainly for dynamic things
[06:10:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  i built a table which can be big
[06:10:16] <taplar> a fragment is a detached dom element that you can operate on
[06:10:24] <hellyeah> if you remembed i want to split into small ones
[06:10:38] <hellyeah> in part of algoritm if there is no table create once
[06:10:46] <taplar> and i remember telling you that you should split it up on the backend, or use ajax to retrieve the smaller subsets
[06:10:52] <hellyeah> so i try to learn how to create html table fully structured.
[06:11:07] <hellyeah> taplar:  step by step
[06:11:07] <hellyeah> :D
[06:11:31] <hellyeah> no ajax here http://jsfiddle.net/f0pxmkvn/25/ :D
[06:11:49] <hellyeah> i guess i will write this function with ajax right
[06:11:51] <taplar> that was to get you to work through the logic
[06:11:58] <taplar> never said that was a best solution
[06:12:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  sure
[06:12:09] <szwetsloot> taplar: Can you see why the .show() doesn't work?
[06:12:18] <hellyeah> i just try to learn part of this algorithm
[06:12:21] <hellyeah> it make sense
[06:12:30] <MikeD_> nobody really wants to see a big table ... in html or anywhere else.
[06:12:42] <hellyeah> taplar:
[06:12:52] <hellyeah> you know what i like most in that algoritm
[06:12:59] <hellyeah> i can have seperate table
[06:12:59] <taplar> szwetsloot: you do a console log in your beforeSend to make sure your executing that function?
[06:13:10] <hellyeah> and i will give data-id same with buttons
[06:13:18] <szwetsloot> taplar: Tried that, it works correctly but doesn't show the #Processing
[06:13:20] <hellyeah> and check if button.data(
[06:13:34] <taplar> szwetsloot: console log your selection of that element and make sure it is finding it
[06:13:35] <hellyeah> and check if button.data(id) === table.data(id)
[06:13:38] <hellyeah> thats all
[06:13:39] <hellyeah> :D
[06:13:39] <szwetsloot> placing $('#Processing').show() before the Ajax() call does work correctly
[06:13:58] <szwetsloot> taplar: Yeah tried that. It returns the correct object
[06:13:59] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[06:14:04] <taplar> hmm
[06:14:32] <taplar> szwetsloot: if your selector is returning a length of 1, not sure why the show is not working
[06:15:16] <szwetsloot> Is there a way to run the show first in this function, then the ajax and then the hide and still get the function output?
[06:15:27] <szwetsloot> I tried doing that, but I couldn't get the scope of the ress variable right
[06:16:08] <taplar> success should execute when your function finishes with a 200
[06:16:18] <taplar> err 2XX
[06:17:01] <szwetsloot> taplar: I'll rewrite it and show you what I mean
[06:17:05] <gagiD> can i disable accordion style?
[06:19:22] <jak2000> my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zymzLr7v/8/ click on Ver Inventario Button, then Click on Cancel Button and again press Ver Inventario Button, at this point not display again the form here i smy problem, how to fix?
[06:19:54] <szwetsloot> I tried this: http://pastebin.com/wSHe9iSx
[06:20:20] <szwetsloot> Taplar: But console.log('test') will output after $('#Processing').hide() ran
[06:20:30] <taplar> szwetsloot: move your success login into the ajax call, using the success option
[06:20:41] <taplar> as is that piece can happen before the ajax finishes
[06:21:11] <szwetsloot> taplar: what do you mean?
[06:21:14] <taplar> success is an option just like beforeSend
[06:21:23] <szwetsloot> Yeah, I am familiar with it
[06:21:31] <szwetsloot> Just scope of the variable didn't work out
[06:21:42] <taplar> which one?
[06:22:14] <szwetsloot> ress
[06:22:33] <taplar> the response would be the first parameter passed into the closure
[06:22:48] <szwetsloot> You mean like this right? http://pastebin.com/hqUkNCLq
[06:23:11] <taplar> yes, but you do not need to check state
[06:23:18] <taplar> oh well
[06:23:21] <taplar> your doing something custom
[06:23:28] <szwetsloot> ah true. But the function now returns null
[06:23:43] <taplar> you don't return from an ajax handler
[06:23:46] <taplar> it's async
[06:23:59] <taplar> oh, your doing false.  avoid that
[06:24:24] <taplar> why are you wanting to return it?
[06:24:24] <szwetsloot> okay, I changed async to true. So how do I return the value out of this function?
[06:24:38] <szwetsloot> I need the ress in another script
[06:24:46] <szwetsloot> several other scripts
[06:25:00] <taplar> so call the functions that you need, passing in the response
[06:25:30] <szwetsloot> er... I think I'm not being clear.
[06:25:57] <szwetsloot> The goal of this function is to make the syntax in the main webpage pretier. I want it to acces pages and return information.
[06:26:27] <taplar> what i'm saying is this.  by doing async false, you stop your processing until that request finishes
[06:26:31] <szwetsloot> But I can't seem to extract the information out of this function. It should be in the ress variable, but it is emptied outside ajax
[06:26:34] <taplar> holds up the user a bit
[06:26:43] <szwetsloot> Yeah, I removed that
[06:26:50] <`ULT> hi taplar
[06:26:54] <taplar> instead, you leave it async, make your request.  then on success or whatever, you invoke whatever you want to happen next
[06:26:59] <taplar> event based logic
[06:27:00] <`ULT> i made something what is working
[06:27:04] <`ULT> but i changed alot code.
[06:27:06] <szwetsloot> http://pastebin.com/xQHRSW6L
[06:27:09] <`ULT> can you take a look?
[06:27:19] <`ULT> if think some code i can better store in a variable.
[06:27:30] <`ULT> so i can use it more than 1 time.
[06:27:32] <taplar> `ULT: i'll try, but ask the room.  lots of peeps here who can pipe in, :)
[06:27:40] <szwetsloot> but placing the return ress; in success doesn't work ?? :(
[06:27:54] <`ULT> this is what i have made
[06:27:55] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/1/
[06:28:13] <`ULT> shit
[06:28:15] <`ULT> thats wrong one
[06:28:24] <`ULT> aah
[06:28:26] <taplar> szwetsloot: ok, you can do that, but there is no guarentee that future code will access the object until after the ajax finishes
[06:28:30] <`ULT> i didnt saved it :o
[06:28:57] <taplar> so when they do, ress could still be an empty object
[06:29:06] <szwetsloot> Yeah, that appears to be happening
[06:29:42] <taplar> when dealing with ajax you have to get into the mindset of events, not procedural
[06:29:58] <`ULT> oke i write it again.
[06:30:03] <szwetsloot> So I need to add a callback to the function?
[06:30:08] <taplar> success is a callback
[06:31:06] <szwetsloot> I'm really confused....
[06:31:25] <hellyeah> success is call back is confused?
[06:31:34] <taplar> so my assumption is your thinking about it like, step one happens, then step 2, then step 3
[06:31:45] <taplar> when it's more like, i do ajax, when it finishes, i do ....
[06:32:04] <szwetsloot> Yeah
[06:32:40] <taplar> so you chain them.  success happens when the ajax completes with success, so whatever you want to happen once that happens, the success needs to invoke it
[06:33:08] <taplar> like wise for error or whatever
[06:33:22] <hellyeah> so error is like exception handling?
[06:33:28] <taplar> yeah
[06:33:39] <hellyeah> so
[06:33:42] <hellyeah> if you write
[06:33:49] <taplar> anything other than a 200 response code is considered an error i believe
[06:33:50] <hellyeah> success: .... error:.. . ,
[06:33:58] <taplar> yes
[06:33:59] <hellyeah> it tried to make function success
[06:33:59] <szwetsloot> Hmm, I think I understand
[06:34:03] <szwetsloot> Thanks, I'll try rewriting
[06:34:05] <hellyeah> it it doesnt success
[06:34:10] <hellyeah> it tries error
[06:34:14] <taplar> no, not try
[06:34:16] <hellyeah> so it is like code block
[06:34:21] <hellyeah> ?
[06:34:24] <taplar> success and error are in relation to the ajax response code
[06:34:31] <taplar> the request handling
[06:35:00] <taplar> if ajax gets a response code of 200-299, it's a success and will do the success callback
[06:35:00] <`ULT> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/3/
[06:35:06] <taplar> anything else, it will do error
[06:35:12] <hellyeah> so
[06:35:26] <hellyeah> error: if you get 404 do that if you get 503 do this
[06:35:28] <hellyeah> can i this
[06:35:36] <hellyeah> can i tyep like that?
[06:35:50] <`ULT> I use this part three times. so i need to make a variable of it?
[06:35:51] <`ULT> ($(this).parents("tr").next('.more-info')
[06:35:54] <taplar> yes, that can be done in different ways
[06:36:09] <taplar> you can either have one function that interrogates the code or you can acutally have separate functions for each code
[06:36:23] <taplar> the api should talk about that
[06:36:36] <hellyeah> i guess my function will have success, error and load
[06:36:36] <taplar> `ULT: good idea.
[06:36:38] <szwetsloot> taplar: Ah great. I got it. Thanks a lot!
[06:36:53] <taplar> cool
[06:36:55] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i use load for loading elements
[06:36:59] <`ULT> is this some correct code taplar?
[06:37:02] <hellyeah> like divs?
[06:37:17] <taplar> i'm not that familiar with the load event, others may can advise
[06:37:24] <hellyeah> ic
[06:37:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  so i can use success, errors as code block
[06:37:41] <taplar> `ULT: it appears to work, :)
[06:37:43] <hellyeah> they own scope
[06:37:50] <hellyeah> they have own scope
[06:38:00] <hellyeah> they are function actually
[06:38:03] <taplar> they're callback options to the ajax function
[06:38:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:38:46] <hellyeah> so
[06:39:13] <hellyeah> you mean wwith callback try this if it is not succesfull (response) do that option
[06:39:30] <hellyeah> actuallt in the first line of ajax i remembered like
[06:39:34] <taplar> in this case your telling ajax what to do
[06:39:36] <hellyeah> you are doing request to url
[06:39:41] <hellyeah> right
[06:39:54] <hellyeah> and it answered you 200 300 400 or 500
[06:39:57] <`ULT> yeah taplar, thanks alot for your help
[06:40:00] <`ULT> I learned alot
[06:40:05] <taplar> good deal
[06:40:10] <hellyeah> so after getting response you do something in callback option
[06:40:20] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[06:40:33] <taplar> ajax gets the response, checks the response code and executes the callback it associates with that code
[06:41:35] <hellyeah> taplar:
[06:41:45] <hellyeah> is success html status code
[06:41:50] <hellyeah> can i think like that?
[06:41:57] <taplar> http
[06:42:01] <taplar> usually
[06:42:08] <hellyeah> sorry http yeah
[06:42:08] <taplar> though you can do other protocols, probably
[06:42:27] <hellyeah> like ftp, sftp, https?
[06:42:32] <hellyeah> ssh?
[06:42:39] <taplar> https yes, probably not the others
[06:42:51] <taplar> maybe i'm just being stupid.  it may be restricted to http and https
[06:43:11] <hellyeah> infos i got from very valuable
[06:43:16] <hellyeah> you are so good person
[06:43:24] <hellyeah> hoping you find the best in your life
[06:43:32] <taplar> :), danka
[06:44:02] <hellyeah> can i use ajax for everything? Every possible secenerio
[06:44:08] <taplar> no
[06:44:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:44:20] <hellyeah> what is the restriction?
[06:44:24] <taplar> it has limitations, such as for file uploads i believe
[06:44:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will have to do in final stage
[06:44:51] <hellyeah> think about a page with pop ups
[06:45:02] <taplar> modals, :)
[06:45:05] <hellyeah> and your page is refreshed in one means
[06:45:09] <hellyeah> sorry modals
[06:45:22] <hellyeah> you have 10 modals all of them is open
[06:45:33] <taplar> sounds cluttered
[06:45:37] <hellyeah> and the page looks with button at the first place
[06:45:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[06:45:52] <hellyeah> you will get first modal by clicking button
[06:46:09] <hellyeah> and you reach another modals with clicking another buttons
[06:46:11] <hellyeah> anyway
[06:46:20] <hellyeah> you page is refresehed
[06:46:20] <taplar> i would suggest using one modal
[06:46:24] <hellyeah> everying is loaded
[06:46:27] <taplar> replace the contents for each button
[06:46:37] <hellyeah> but you got page still modals open
[06:46:50] <hellyeah> is that related with AJAX?
[06:46:57] <taplar> no
[06:47:02] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:47:07] <taplar> 'everything loaded' does not reflect ajax
[06:47:12] <hellyeah> hope you understand the problem?
[06:47:19] <hellyeah> do you understand
[06:47:26] <taplar> maybe not
[06:47:37] <hellyeah> okey let me show my example
[06:47:58] <hellyeah> a sec
[06:48:51] <hellyeah> click the animated button and then click hand button and click square button on the table you will get three modals http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/74/embedded/result/
[06:49:27] <hellyeah> you clicked?
[06:49:38] <taplar> yep
[06:49:43] <hellyeah> okey
[06:49:57] <hellyeah> we can criticize my code later if you dont mind but later
[06:50:01] <hellyeah> click f5
[06:50:06] <hellyeah> you will turn to button right
[06:50:14] <taplar> yep
[06:50:47] <hellyeah> so
[06:51:03] <hellyeah> when i click f5 i want to page loaded and return to last state i have
[06:51:10] <hellyeah> it is like saving the state i guess
[06:51:35] <taplar> you'll have to store something related to each of the opened elements to know that you need to re-open them.  possibly in localStorage
[06:51:48] <taplar> then evaluate that each time the page loads and if there is something, reopen them
[06:51:52] <hellyeah> html local storage?
[06:51:56] <taplar> hold on
[06:52:05] <hellyeah> you mean like bool value?
[06:52:13] <hellyeah> check if true or false
[06:52:15] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[06:52:16] <hellyeah> i am waiting
[06:52:25] <taplar> no, not a boolean
[06:52:35] <taplar> an identifier for the element like an id or something
[06:52:47] <taplar> that you can use to know which element you need to reopen
[06:53:29] <hellyeah> anyhow it is supported by ie8
[06:53:45] <taplar> according to that page yes
[06:54:06] <hellyeah> taplar:  can you give me quick fiddle if you dont mind
[06:54:17] <hellyeah> or
[06:54:26] <hellyeah> iw ill keep it in my mind
[06:54:32] <hellyeah> and dig it little bit
[06:54:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:54:46] <hellyeah> dialog has open and close function
[06:54:50] <hellyeah> callbacks*
[06:56:52] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/z96wh57o/1/
[06:57:17] <taplar> change the value, then rerun the script
[06:57:56] <hellyeah> wow
[06:58:00] <hellyeah> i am seeing thee text
[06:58:04] <hellyeah> after refreshing
[06:58:12] <taplar> localStorage is persisted at the browser/tab level
[06:58:27] <taplar> so you can refresh all day, it will still exist
[06:58:34] <taplar> until the user closes their browser/tab
[06:58:45] <malcolm2> is it true you can just do: " $(function() " instead of " $(document).ready(function(){}; " etc?
[06:58:54] <taplar> yes
[06:59:01] <malcolm2> why
[06:59:03] <hellyeah> so
[06:59:11] <hellyeah> this will chekc input has a value
[06:59:19] <taplar> gah, don't ask me that, lol
[06:59:24] <taplar> it does though
[06:59:29] <malcolm2> k
[06:59:29] <hellyeah> no
[06:59:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:59:46] <hellyeah> malcolm2:
[06:59:47] <taplar> hellyeah: it's checking if city is set in localstorage
[06:59:52] <hellyeah> you ask why it is true?
[06:59:57] <malcolm2> yeah
[07:00:27] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:00:31] <malcolm2> ?
[07:00:33] <malcolm2> no
[07:00:33] <hellyeah> do you understand the code?
[07:00:38] <malcolm2> no
[07:00:42] <hellyeah> or it is just copy and paste
[07:00:48] <malcolm2> are you talking to me?
[07:00:51] <hellyeah> so you want expalanation of the code
[07:00:53] <hellyeah> yes
[07:01:04] <malcolm2> yeah why does $(function() work
[07:01:50] <hellyeah> it may be shortcut
[07:01:56] <malcolm2> no shit
[07:02:00] <malcolm2> are you retarded?
[07:02:05] <hellyeah> check here http://jsfiddle.net/10r8upvu/48/
[07:02:09] <malcolm2> thanks
[07:02:13] <hellyeah> malcolm2:  i am beginner
[07:02:17] <hellyeah> so i try to help you
[07:02:23] <hellyeah> i am learning at the same time
[07:02:31] <hellyeah> this is not good to use "foul word"
[07:02:34] <malcolm2> dont worry about it, thanks
[07:02:40] <hellyeah> i am just the person in front of keyboard
[07:02:45] <hellyeah> so be nice
[07:02:49] <malcolm2> you are mexican in front of keyboard
[07:03:03] <hellyeah> mexican people are smart
[07:03:07] <hellyeah> you know that
[07:03:12] <malcolm2> i do know that
[07:03:20] <hellyeah> okey
[07:03:23] <malcolm2> okey
[07:03:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i check if dialog box is open
[07:04:07] <hellyeah> if it is open setItem to lcoal storage
[07:04:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:04:12] <hellyeah> i will search it
[07:04:19] <hellyeah> so it seems the way to go
[07:06:35] <taplar> sorry, stepped away
[07:07:22] <taplar> yeah, on dialog box open you'd want to store in localStorage something identifying it, and remove it when your close it
[07:07:38] <taplar> so if they hit refresh you'd check that to know which ones to reopen
[07:09:09] <taplar> also please avoid making derogatory statements in chat please.  public place
[07:12:18] <taplar> looks like he left, but for anyone who is interested: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.init
[07:12:36] <taplar> towards the bottom you can see where the logic handles for the document ready for you if you use the shortcut
[07:16:04] <taplar> afk for a bit
[07:24:07] <hellyeah> deragatory
[07:24:11] <hellyeah> what does that mean
[07:24:25] <taplar> may be spelled wrong
[07:24:50] <taplar> basicly putting another person down based on racial sterotypes
[07:25:02] <hellyeah> void making derogatory statements in chat please.
[07:25:12] <hellyeah> i didnt do that
[07:25:16] <hellyeah> did it?
[07:25:19] <taplar> wasn't to you
[07:25:23] <hellyeah> ah okey
[07:25:39] <hellyeah> chat is not the place for doing this anyway
[07:26:07] <taplar> shouldn't happen in any case, but it happens
[07:26:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i ask your idea? My code looks terrible http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/74/
[07:27:19] <taplar> any part in particular?
[07:28:20] <hellyeah> in general?
[07:28:26] <hellyeah> Do you have a suggestion
[07:28:30] <taplar> ah, well
[07:28:34] <hellyeah> if you have suggestion i will take a note
[07:28:55] <taplar> ln 9, 12, 15
[07:29:22] <hellyeah> you suggest prop?
[07:29:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:29:29] <taplar> you could put those css styles in classes, put the classes on the elements instead.  then your conditionals could be changed to check hasClass()
[07:29:33] <hellyeah> yeah i am loking for it
[07:29:57] * hellyeah taking notes
[07:30:52] <taplar> classes are also easier to add/remove than straight up style elements
[07:31:11] <taplar> imho
[07:31:48] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:31:53] <hellyeah> i am sorry i disconnected
[07:32:00] <taplar> np
[07:32:04] <hellyeah> the last message i got about line 9,12,15
[07:32:08] <taplar> oh
[07:32:13] <taplar> you could put those css styles in classes, put the classes on the elements instead.  then your conditionals could be changed to check hasClass()
[07:32:16] <hellyeah> write css rule and check with hasClass method
[07:32:22] <taplar> yeah
[07:32:36] <hellyeah> okey is there anything else?
[07:32:44] <taplar> do that first, then lets see what you go
[07:32:47] <taplar> got
[07:32:50] <hellyeah> i just try to learn it properly
[07:33:17] <taplar> k, but just so you know, you may not be learning properly.  your just learning taplar, :)
[07:34:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  :D
[07:34:33] <hellyeah> you are master right now :XD
[07:37:29] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:37:47] <hellyeah> actually it doesnt work righ now probably i did mistake but this is what you meant http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/95/
[07:38:28] <taplar> you have a console error
[07:39:03] <hellyeah> fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/96/
[07:39:39] <hellyeah> but counter is gone :D
[07:40:18] <derstrom> hellyeah: you *might* be able to shorten ln 50 to ln 53 by concatenating the different methods into one like this: .appendTo(buttonToTheHead).removeClass('hideButton').show(). I might be wrong; I don't know if appendTo() returns the object that you are appending the button to or not.
[07:40:55] <hellyeah> hmm so
[07:41:05] <taplar> appendTo() returns the parent operated on
[07:41:06] <hellyeah> by connection to methos each other
[07:41:12] <hellyeah> i will give it a try
[07:41:22] <taplar> err, sorry, child
[07:41:27] <taplar> i would think
[07:41:39] <derstrom> I'm thinking that too, I'm not sure though. documentation doesn't say
[07:44:14] <hellyeah> anything else
[07:44:24] <hellyeah> do i need to change for loop to forEach
[07:44:26] <derstrom> hellyeah: yeah, this is possible because the same object is returned each time (the button). if it doesn't work, then the button isn't being returned on appendTo I imagine
[07:44:27] <taplar> hold on, i'm having to fix something of mine
[07:44:30] <hellyeah> is it necessary to do that?
[07:44:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  sure
[07:44:37] <taplar> derstrom can probably point out more
[07:45:14] <derstrom> hellyeah: what line are you referring to?
[07:45:17] <derstrom> ln 7?
[07:45:55] <hellyeah> derstrom:  http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/97/
[07:46:05] <hellyeah> this is what you meant
[07:46:28] <hellyeah> derstrom:  there are 3-4 for loop in my code
[07:46:57] <taplar> another thing, your constantly repeating $(table[i])
[07:47:03] <taplar> store that in a variable and use the variable
[07:47:13] <hellyeah> global variable?
[07:47:16] <taplar> no
[07:47:18] <taplar> local to the loop
[07:47:27] <hellyeah> which line?
[07:47:38] <hellyeah> ic
[07:47:38] <taplar> you could do it immediately inside the loop if you wanted
[07:47:40] <hellyeah> oke
[07:47:40] <hellyeah> y
[07:48:06] <craftbynick> Hey guys, quick question.  Am I allowed to post projects here incase I need help with one of my projects?  Willing to pay ofcourse.  I dont want to mess with the TOS of this channel thus I am asking first.
[07:48:08] <hellyeah> does it make any difference?
[07:48:09] <derstrom> hellyeah: for each loops were deprecated a long time ago I think - they aren't supported in any browsers
[07:48:33] <hellyeah> derstrom:  so forEach(function(){ ..  })
[07:48:38] <taplar> craftbynick: typically we ask for small examples of issue we can provide input to
[07:48:55] <taplar> craftbynick: entirely a free channel
[07:49:55] <craftbynick> taplar: I was asking regarding outsourcing basically I am working on some projects as I started a small company and everything is going well however I can personally only work in so many projects at a time but I am getting too many requests so thought instead of rejecting project requests I could simply document it and post it here so others can earn as well while I can build my company.
[07:50:16] <taplar> oh, not sure that this is the proper place then
[07:50:50] <hellyeah> derstrom:  line 9-18 didnt work can you look at this http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/98/?
[07:50:54] <hellyeah> derstrom:  line 9-18 didnt work can you look at this http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/98/ ?
[07:51:22] <craftbynick> taplar: gotcha I tried freelancer websites but most of the resources there are not exactly very good lol I learned development through freenode where people actually know what they are doing lol
[07:51:33] <hellyeah> #freelancer may be
[07:51:36] <derstrom> hellyeah: yes, there is .forEach() but is only supported in IE 9 and above
[07:51:42] <hellyeah> there is a channel for that
[07:51:52] <hellyeah> derstrom:  also need i.e.8
[07:52:01] <taplar> this is just me spitballing, but you might could post something on the jquery forums, if they have any.  or maybe on their facebook/google+ pages to get more eyes on it
[07:52:06] <derstrom> yep, so for loops are just fine then
[07:52:09] <craftbynick> tried that but hard to find someone with specific knowledge... oh well ill try and figure something out
[07:52:23] <taplar> gl
[07:52:27] <craftbynick> taplar: thanks
[07:52:28] <hellyeah> derstrom:  for loop works on chrome it seems
[07:52:45] <arckai> craftbynick how much are you willing to pay per hour/project?
[07:53:02] <hellyeah> derstrom:  but my target i.e. 8 - 9 - 10 - 11
[07:53:03] <derstrom> hellyeah: it's just IE that's bad
[07:53:11] <derstrom> IE 8 and below - forEach isn't supported
[07:53:26] <hellyeah> instutional preference
[07:53:30] <hellyeah> noitthing i can do
[07:53:35] <hellyeah> IE
[07:54:02] <derstrom> It's Microsoft's way of causing pain and suffering to the world's developers :)
[07:54:58] <hellyeah> edge will beomc e good as people said
[07:55:33] <taplar> is 98 the latest version of the fiddle?
[07:57:44] <derstrom> hellyeah: It's IE 9 and below that are the main problems for development. However if you can drop IE 8 support, trust me you'll notice how much less work is involved if you're working on any kind of sizeable project.
[07:58:11] <derstrom> I convinced my boss to let me drop IE 8 support and it has saved me a lot of compatibility work.
[07:58:46] <taplar> we pretty much changed to chrome once google mail was adopted as the company email provider
[07:59:06] <taplar> still some older apps that are written for ie though
[07:59:22] <hellyeah> well
[07:59:34] <hellyeah> derstrom:  i hear dusing jquery 1.9 or 1.0
[07:59:42] <hellyeah> and es5-shim
[07:59:49] <hellyeah> can help me with i.e. 8 issue
[08:00:34] <derstrom> hellyeah: if you are having problems with your JavaScript code, activate your browser's Developer Tools and see if there are any errors being output in the "Console" tab (make sure JavaScript is selected). You can activate your browser's Developer Tools by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (if you're using a Mac, Cmd + Option + I).
[08:00:56] <hellyeah> i dont have problem right now
[08:01:14] <derstrom> Ah OK. what's your question?
[08:01:31] <hellyeah> actually i have a problem i used hasClass
[08:01:36] <hellyeah> but counter didnt work here
[08:01:58] <hellyeah> inf ace i cannot increase redCounter, orangeCounter or grayCounter
[08:02:04] <hellyeah> can you tke a look http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/98/
[08:03:17] <taplar> you probably want to move your counter checks outside of your loop
[08:03:34] <taplar> they're happening every time
[08:03:44] <hellyeah> well
[08:03:55] <hellyeah> this check if is there any red field on the table
[08:04:05] <hellyeah> in this case my table has two records
[08:04:10] <hellyeah> so counter will be two
[08:04:10] <taplar> no, the !== 0 checks
[08:04:52] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:05:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  problem is counter must be visible
[08:06:08] <hellyeah> there is 2 red, one orange and one gray records
[08:06:35] <taplar_> sorry, disconnected
[08:06:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  problem is counter must be visible [15:06:07] <hellyeah> there is 2 red, one orange and one gray records
[08:07:22] <taplar> my point is as you loop your continuously checking them each time and re-setting them
[08:07:29] <taplar> where as you could just set them at the end
[08:07:41] <taplar> it's going to happen so fast the user isn't going to she incrementing
[08:07:50] <taplar> she = see
[08:08:14] <hellyeah> at the end
[08:08:20] <hellyeah> you mean outside the for loop
[08:08:21] <hellyeah> ?
[08:08:23] <taplar> yes
[08:08:45] <hellyeah> ha yeah sorry
[08:08:55] <hellyeah> i moved those checks outside for loop http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/99/
[08:12:24] <taplar> your counter is not working as the trs don't have the classes on them
[08:12:33] <taplar> they still have the css on them
[08:12:52] <hellyeah> yes you are right
[08:13:02] <hellyeah> girst i need to add this class
[08:13:04] <hellyeah> and check it
[08:13:10] <hellyeah> i can do that later
[08:14:20] <taplar> also you don't have to do a loop for your counters
[08:14:26] <taplar> you could just use a filter
[08:15:38] <hellyeah> i should check filter
[09:00:21] <subsonic> I have a list on the left and right, when I double click an item, I want it to go to the other list (not that difficult for me), however, it would be nice for each item to go in alphabetically.   Can anybody offer a suggestion on the best way to so this?
[09:09:04] <robertmaxrees> subsonic you could have 2 arrays behind the scenes and sort them whenever they're modified.
[09:09:10] <robertmaxrees> then render them out.
[09:10:32] <subsonic> robbyoconnor: totally forgot about javascript sort :)
[09:46:34] <esaym153> I am trying to submit a form a json. This is what I have and what I get: http://pastie.org/private/3za12vuz2lr42cwrvexug It should be obvious based on my input names what I am trying to do. I had hoped jquery would be 'automatic' but it is not.
[09:47:01] <esaym153> so what is the best way to get an array of objects from a form input and then submit it as json to a url?
[09:48:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not something jquery does automatically.
[09:48:10] <taplar> what does the intended json result look like?
[09:48:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's shown below.
[09:48:36] <taplar> i thought that's what he's saying he's getting now
[09:48:41] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[09:48:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not the format they're expecting.
[09:48:51] <taplar> right, i'm asking what he's expecting
[09:49:03] <robertmaxrees> for item to be an array.
[09:49:30] <taplar> ah, yeah, that'll take a little fanagling
[09:49:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:49:42] <esaym153> taplar: the actual result that is posted is something like: item[0][part_number]=1234&item[0][name]=stuff
[09:49:56] <esaym153> so, not json at all.
[09:49:57] <robertmaxrees> esaym153 yeah, you'll need to build out what you want mnanually.
[09:51:57] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: hmm, so what is the best way to name the input fields? instead of item[0][part_number], should I just have 'part_number'?
[09:52:13] <robertmaxrees> can you show a fiddle of wht you're trying to do?
[09:52:49] <robertmaxrees> because if you're expecting multiple part_number fields, that might not work very well.
[09:54:19] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: yes, I am submitting an 'item', but it has attributes. And there are many of these 'items' that are submittied together to make up an assembly
[09:54:28] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fiddle?
[09:54:56] <esaym153> the process that will receive the POST, will assemble the items into an assembly (which is part numbers and stuff like that)
[09:56:09] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: well I am still planning this, so nothing is concrete yet. What I want is an array of these items, each element of that array being an 'item object' basically
[09:56:19] <robertmaxrees> then use $.fn.map()
[09:56:31] <esaym153> which this is supposed to be the point of json I thought,
[09:56:44] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: yea was going to start messing with map
[09:56:57] <robertmaxrees> it can be - jquery doesn't know how to guess your format.  that's not how it works ;)
[09:57:59] <robertmaxrees> something like var my $('.formGroup').map(function() { return { $(this).find('part_number').val(), $(this).find('quantity').val()} }).get();
[10:00:25] <lyhr> if i have an EventListener for window resize that has a statement with an addClass method in it for a specific id of course and i have that in a function that gets run on pages that do not have that id is that super bad or not a major deal?  I want this code to be in a component that will be dynamically added to all of my pages so I can maintain it in one place vs. on each page but would need that statement in it
[10:00:42] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: ok, but what is the best way to name each input element to make for an easy map? You saw my current example of item[0][part_number], item[0][name], ect. I am guessing that is not the best way
[10:01:20] <taplar> lyhr: so it's potentially trying to add a class to something not found?
[10:01:29] <taplar> not really a problem i wouldn't think
[10:01:34] <lyhr> correct
[10:02:09] <taplar> iirc, the first statement of jquery usually is a length cheeck
[10:02:10] <taplar> check
[10:02:54] <lyhr> this would be the statement that possibly would not find a #responsiveTable id $('#responsiveTable').addClass('table-responsive');
[10:03:10] <taplar> yeah, i wouldn't think it's a biggie
[10:03:45] <lyhr> ok i will go with it. thanks for the feedback taplar
[10:06:17] <robertmaxrees> esaym153 just name them according to what they hold.
[10:06:18] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:19:13] <oste> anyone ever experience an element returning 0 width in chrome?
[10:19:36] <taplar> an element without content can be zero width
[10:19:55] <oste> no this is 100% width
[10:20:08] <oste> it only happens sometimes
[10:20:23] <taplar> what element?  got a fiddle?
[10:20:29] <abishek> can anybody advice on how to implement aligning rules using jquery draggable. Ex. http://screencast.com/t/MGjZ1mej3be
[10:20:50] <oste> i opened a issue a while back
[10:21:01] <oste> probably the worst thing i have ever come across in all my days
[10:22:10] <taplar> you must not watch the news much
[10:22:14] <oste> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2191
[10:22:23] <oste> as a dev :)
[10:22:39] <oste> i am not using jquery in my current test
[10:22:46] <oste> so i don't think it is jquery related
[10:22:48] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a jquery problem?
[10:23:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds liek a race condition.
[10:23:18] <oste> seems to be a browser issue
[10:23:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:23:36] <oste> it is easier to produce when opening in a new tab
[10:23:43] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[10:27:07] <oste> crazy its not fixed by now :(
[10:27:24] <oste> i guess if you have a ton of crap on the page maybe it doesn't happen
[10:29:10] <taplar> maybe you could do a vid capturing the issue for documenation purposes
[10:30:02] <robertmaxrees> oste welcome to chrome - they don't fix issues like this very often.
[10:30:28] <oste> so are we supposed to add timeouts?
[10:30:30] <robertmaxrees> popstates were bugged for like 5+ years and webkit ignored it for sexy new features.
[10:30:39] <taplar> lol
[10:30:55] <oste> i think i need a timeout to check for width for crying out loud
[10:31:03] <oste> if its 0 keep checking
[10:31:24] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish here?
[10:31:27] <oste> how this is not more of an issue is beyond me, seems so simple
[10:31:28] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to know the width?
[10:31:44] <arc_> i never knew this existed, but it's quite a useful resource http://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/windows/
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:31:51] <oste> so i can determine how many children can fit in there
[10:32:04] <robertmaxrees> oste huh?
[10:32:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a job for CSS>
[10:32:39] <robertmaxrees> arc_ modern.ie is a fantastic resource that not enough people use.
[10:32:46] <taplar> interesting.  doesn't require any licenses?
[10:33:00] <robertmaxrees> you occasionally have to re-arm/reinstall the vm.
[10:33:13] <robertmaxrees> but the images already have the licenses in them.
[10:33:53] <taplar> is it on vmware or, whatever that other one is i'm forgetting.  starts with a P
[10:33:53] <arc_> doing that once every 90 days isn't a bad price to pay
[10:34:02] <arc_> taplar it has images for any software you want
[10:34:10] <taplar> nice
[10:34:35] <arc_> well maybe not any software. but several different ones
[10:34:44] <taplar> hah, starts with a P.  yeah, VirtualBox starts with a P...
[10:34:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar http://i.imgur.com/9Goh37a.png
[10:34:49] <arc_> lol -_-
[10:34:58] <robertmaxrees> hyperv, virtualbox, vmware, and vpc
[10:36:04] <taplar> i really wish our shop did vms.  would really help new people coming on teams if they could just download an image and already have the ide and environment setup
[10:36:23] <robertmaxrees> taplar huh?
[10:36:28] <taplar> just talkin
[10:36:29] <robertmaxrees> VMs for your entire setup?  yuck.
[10:36:39] <taplar> just the ide
[10:36:47] <taplar> and any related local servers
[10:36:58] <robertmaxrees> a vm to run the application in is awesome, but the IDE inside of a VM sounds like too much work imo.
[10:37:03] <robertmaxrees> just pass around config files.
[10:37:37] <taplar> eh some of the groups have build servers with the cookbooks and stuff to build boxes automatically
[10:38:00] <robertmaxrees> sure - requiring somebody to run an OS inside their host OS to do work seems really overkill imo.
[10:38:35] <taplar> not so bad, :)
[10:39:06] <robertmaxrees> eh.  that seems like it'd get really old - lots more resources than necessary just to run an IDE.  plus your IT staff should be setting all that up for new hires anyway.
[10:39:27] <taplar> we are the IT staff, :P
[10:39:49] <robertmaxrees> so you have developers provisioning machines and whatnot?
[10:40:00] <arc_> well, upgrading to windows 10 seems to have gotten rid of all my vmware virtual ethernet adapters
[10:40:24] <oste> Vagrant is awesome for setting up VM environemnts
[10:40:37] <taplar> some do, but no, they aren't the defined IT's IT staff.  but they have leeway to do some things that they want
[10:40:42] <taplar> yeah, some use Vagrant
[10:40:46] <taplar> too
[10:40:46] <robertmaxrees> oste absolutely.  we use it here religiously.
[10:40:47] <oste> we use Ansible to provision them, then can take that same Ansible config and use it for prod server setup
[10:41:16] <oste> all environments are excactly the same from dev to prod :)
[10:41:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:46:32] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: sorry for all the questions. So if I have many 'items' in the form, and each has its own attributes, what is the best way to group them so I can easily get an array? I am thinking 'fieldset'? $('form fieldset').each() maybe?
[10:47:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use .each()
[10:47:02] <robertmaxrees> use .map()
[10:47:04] <robertmaxrees> i showed you earlier.
[10:47:35] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: hmm, I was thinking .each, and each one of those I would .map..
[10:47:46] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[10:47:48] <robertmaxrees> just .map()_
[10:47:54] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle of your form at all?
[10:48:15] <oste> .serialize() can also be useful https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:48:21] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: fiddling right now, got sidetracked with the fieldset idea
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> oste they want a particular format for their data that serialize doesn't give them :)
[10:50:45] <Trieste> hiya, how can I ensure that the "complete" callback after say, .fadeTo() only runs once after all the items that are covered by the selector have finished animating?
[10:50:52] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: ah, in your example up top, you used hardcoded names, each of my 'items' has 3 attributes, but sometimes there is an optional 4th or 5th
[10:52:37] <taplar> Trieste: have you tried using a function like then() ?
[10:52:51] <robertmaxrees> Trieste .done() - that's the callback you want.
[10:53:10] <taplar> yeah, just saw the 'or in progress' in the api
[10:53:12] <Trieste> oooh, thank you!
[10:53:50] <arc_> oh yeah that reminds me. is there any reasonable way to prevent manual scrolling only during a scroll animation
[10:55:20] <robertmaxrees> esaym153 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wnav6wpt/
[10:56:15] <Trieste> taplar, robertmaxrees: however, the animation methods don't return a jqXHR object
[10:56:27] <robertmaxrees> Trieste they return a deferred.
[10:56:31] <robertmaxrees> which is where .done() comes frome.
[10:56:55] <Trieste> I'm getting a "foo.done" is not a function error
[10:57:04] <Trieste> I'm probably missing something obvious
[10:57:11] <arc_> where did you put it
[10:57:16] <taplar> fiddle
[10:57:44] <taplar> por favor
[10:58:11] <Trieste> var foo = $('selector').fadeTo(200, 0);
[10:58:15] <Trieste> foo.done(...
[10:58:25] <Trieste> k
[10:59:07] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: ty, that is kind of what I was thinking
[10:59:20] <taplar> hmm, faidTo returns a jQuery object
[10:59:23] <taplar> not a deferred
[10:59:57] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/promise/ fwiw
[11:00:20] <taplar> ah, boom
[11:02:56] <Trieste> yep, that works, thanks robertmaxrees & taplar
[11:04:48] <robertmaxrees> esaym153 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wnav6wpt/3/ for when you have optional extras.
[11:34:28] <abishek> can anybody advice on how to implement aligning rules using jquery draggable. Ex. http://screencast.com/t/MGjZ1mej3be
[11:52:52] <GreatDanton> how do I select td in table with certain id? Is it $('td').find(...)?
[11:56:38] <Pazician> Hello, why do I get an error saying "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'slideDown' of undefined" when I try to run this code: http://paste.ofcode.org/3zUUEy2s94tHr59ckEdHP9
[12:02:49] <taplar> GreatDanton: if your selecting by ids, you can just select with the id
[12:03:03] <taplar> $('#id')
[12:03:12] <GreatDanton> oh okay, thanks Tadas
[12:03:13] <GreatDanton> taplar,
[12:03:27] <GreatDanton> sry pressed tab to fast
[12:03:30] <taplar> np
[12:03:57] <taplar> Pazician: that error happens when the element your trying to operate on does not exist
[12:05:56] <Pazician> taplar: But it does exist, right? It's working on a wider screen than 600px, I don't really understand why I get that error?
[12:06:36] <taplar> not sure what you mean.  the element in question is header
[12:07:14] <taplar> oh, lol
[12:07:23] <taplar> your defining header inside your top if
[12:07:29] <taplar> it's not defined in your else
[12:07:37] <Pazician> taplar: Godd*mn....
[12:08:02] <taplar> chiiiiiiiiil man, :)
[12:08:13] <Pazician> taplar: Hmm... CodeKit tells me that it's already defined
[12:08:23] <taplar> codekit lies then
[12:08:33] <Pazician> taplar: Hold on, let me try it
[12:09:05] <Pazician> taplar: Grr, CodeKit... Works perfect! Thank you, bud
[12:09:12] <taplar> :)
[12:10:58] <Pazician> taplar: One more thing, when I try it on my phone the "main-header" goes up and down while I scroll, but it doesn't do that when check it on my computer screen - what could be the problem?
[12:11:33] <taplar> not sure, not really a mobile guy myself
[12:11:56] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, I'll try to figure it out then. Thanks anyways
[12:13:45] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: so to make whaat you posted a little more dynamic: https://jsfiddle.net/sqnc7rf3/  could you look it over/point out errors?
[12:18:32] <taplar> esaym153: what errors you got?
[12:19:10] <esaym153> taplar: none other than I have no idea what I am doing :p
[12:19:52] <taplar> your binding an event to a button
[12:19:52] <esaym153> (well actually I took two jquery classes, but don't really know JS. Things were going really well the last few days until I got to this each(), map() stuff...)
[12:20:10] <taplar> when that is clicked, it selects all the fieldset objects
[12:20:24] <taplar> and iterates over them, translating them with your function
[12:20:40] <taplar> which is building an object and putting all the input key values into it and returning it
[12:20:51] <taplar> so at the end of the map, you have a list of all your translations
[12:20:58] <taplar> your then logging that
[12:21:09] <esaym153> indeed :)
[12:21:24] <taplar> so what is it you don't have an idea about?
[12:22:58] <canine> I have 3 divs in a parent div called "line" - I have something working using prependTo but it will inserts the new div I want as first child inside line. I want to be able to insert a div as sibbling instead as child
[12:23:03] <esaym153> taplar: oh, well by that I meant I wasn't sure if it was the approved 'jquery way', since robertmaxrees  used 'this' here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wnav6wpt/3/  a little different (and I know 'this' is a confusing thing to many)
[12:23:08] <canine> So this works but it places the new div as a child instead of sibbling
[12:23:16] <canine> $('.col-1').last().prependTo($(this).closest('.line'));
[12:23:28] <taplar> esaym153: if it works and you understand it, it's all good
[12:23:46] <canine> basically i want the 	$('.col-1').last() to be inserted inside line but as the 2nd element child
[12:24:00] <canine> little help would be much appreciated
[12:24:24] <taplar> inserting siblings you can use insertBefore() or insertAfter()
[12:24:55] <canine> I tried but for some reason it wont work
[12:25:56] <canine> $('.col-2').last().insertAfter($(this).closest('.line'));
[12:25:57] <canine> wont work
[12:26:02] <canine> what am i doing wrong
[12:26:12] <taplar> your operating off of the line element
[12:26:20] <canine> $('.col-2').last().insertAfter($(this).closest('.line.col-1'));
[12:26:21] <canine> sorry
[12:26:29] <canine> thats what i have, still no go
[12:26:37] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[12:27:29] <taplar> and .line.col-1 is looking for an element that has both line and col-1 classes
[12:27:34] <canine> http://pastebin.com/VUBNXQrc
[12:27:37] <taplar> your missing a space if your looking for nesting
[12:31:33] <canine> the classes was wrong indeed, but still no go
[12:31:36] <canine> $('.col-2').last().insertAfter($(this).closest('.col-1'))
[12:32:16] <taplar> according to your selector, your this is a span under a col-2
[12:32:21] <taplar> there will not be a closest col-1
[12:32:44] <taplar> closest looks for a match in the parent element only
[12:32:51] <taplar> elements
[12:32:54] <canine> oh
[12:33:20] <taplar> you'll want to go up to the line level and then find the col-1
[12:33:21] <canine> can i use .next together with that
[12:33:33] <canine> right thats exactly what i want
[12:34:11] <taplar> so closest('.line').find('.col-1')
[12:34:23] <canine> is find and next the same?
[12:34:38] <taplar> no, find searches all (nested) children for a match
[12:34:44] <taplar> next() goes to the next sibling
[12:35:30] <taplar> $('.line') is the same as $('body').find('.line')
[12:36:07] <canine> $('.col-2').last().insertAfter($(this).closest('.line').find('col-1')); - still no go
[12:36:35] <canine> i will have multiple <div class="line"><div col1><div col2><div col2></div>
[12:36:42] <canine> sorry col3 last div
[12:36:56] <canine> anyway that line still wont work
[12:37:23] <taplar> canine: can you create a fiddle of the issue?
[12:37:35] <canine> yeah hold on
[12:37:48] <taplar> also you don't have to do the detach
[12:37:59] <taplar> moving an element automatically detaches it from the old parent
[12:38:08] <taplar> dom elements can only have one parent
[12:43:50] <canine> https://jsfiddle.net/n8x5cr1o/
[12:44:18] <canine> basically i have 3 columns with divs(boxes) when I close one by pressing X it will move the last div to its place
[12:44:24] <canine> col-1 col-2 col-3
[12:44:38] <canine> i click on col-2, it will delete that element and place the last col-2 in its place
[12:46:15] <canine> for colum 1 it works
[12:46:30] <canine> column1 it works with the current code, because it places the new div as first child of div line
[12:46:52] <canine> which is correct, but for col-2 and col-3 it does not, because the new div needs to go the right place
[12:46:57] <canine> i hope i am being clear
[12:47:00] <canine> thanks so much btw
[12:47:05] <taplar> np
[12:48:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/n8x5cr1o/1/ just to see it a little better, heh
[12:49:13] <canine> right on
[12:50:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/n8x5cr1o/2/
[12:58:13] <taplar> so take a look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/n8x5cr1o/3/
[12:58:35] <taplar> notebly the second binding
[12:58:43] <taplar> notably, however it's spelled
[13:00:42] <blinky_> hi all, wondering if someone could help a minute please.  I am trying to place a pin into an embedded google maps.  I will be getting the long and lat from a database that is being supplied via a mobile phone.  I am trying every way I can find to get the script to work but nothing is displaying.  If I do it as as a single string then I get an error, if I break it down into two and place the variables in I get a map canvas without a 
[13:00:44] <blinky_> http://pastie.org/10328061
[13:02:37] <nevillechosenone> canine: Just a thought on what you're working on... if it's not important that you know which col/row a button is in, you can use a fixed width UL and each button could be a LI display inline-block. Removing a LI (button) then would automatically move the next LI up for you.
[13:03:26] <canine> i want to copy the last div to its place and the other divs stay in place
[13:03:55] <canine> Similar to facebook friend suggest, when you add one and another one shows up in its place, without moving the other elements around
[13:04:03] <blinky_> nevermind, got it
[13:04:17] <nevillechosenone> OK I gotcha, forget my comment then since it doesn't quite apply to your situation.
[13:04:55] <canine> not copy, move. But thanks for the suggestion, would work great but i wouldnt want the other elements to move place
[13:05:04] <taplar> canine: you see my last link?
[13:05:18] <canine> oh looking now
[13:05:19] <canine> :)
[13:07:30] <taplar> i'm out for the day, but take a look at that.  also something to think about, there is the jquery function replaceWith() you should take a gander at
[13:08:06] <taplar> and the edge case of what if they click the bottom most button of a column
[13:08:20] <canine> it is finding the right element, but how to i insert it in the right place
[13:08:32] <taplar> look at replaceWith()
[13:08:51] <taplar> i'm out.  l8r!
[13:08:56] <canine> ok thanks
[13:09:00] <canine> much appreciated
[13:16:46] <robertmaxrees> weee
[13:21:27] <canine> got it taplar, i had to use   var lastColumn = $('.col-3').last(); instead of var lastColumn = column.closest('.suggested-friends').find('.line:last .col-3');
[13:21:31] <canine> but seems to work now
[13:21:32] <canine> thanks alot
[13:21:40] <canine> replacewith did the job, thats what i needed
[13:32:09] <taplar_tmp> you get it canine
[13:32:10] <taplar_tmp> ?
[13:33:07] <canine> yea
[13:33:15] <canine> well just about
[13:33:30] <canine> it wont work if there is only 1 column left
[13:33:36] <taplar_tmp> got home and my curiosity got the better of me so i hopped back in, :)
[13:33:59] <canine> i had to use   var lastColumn = $('.col-3').last(); instead of var lastColumn = column.closest('.suggested-friends').find('.line:last .col-3');
[13:35:07] <taplar_tmp> oh!
[13:35:16] <taplar_tmp> so your not shifting by relative column
[13:35:21] <taplar_tmp> but by all of them
[13:35:55] <taplar_tmp> is that true?
[13:37:58] <canine> well, i want to stick to the right column
[13:38:28] <taplar_tmp> so move all the col 3's before moving the 2's and 1's?
[13:38:33] <canine> But what i will do is I will show 6 columns, 3 lines
[13:38:42] <canine> and then the other ones will be hidden, and will replace the ones i X out
[13:38:51] <canine> once there is only 6, i do not want those to shift around
[13:39:03] <canine> might be a little complicated but thats what I would optimally want
[13:39:09] <canine> yeah
[13:39:30] <taplar_tmp> that's a little weird to me
[13:39:58] <canine> I dont want them to move around, but i will only show 3 lines worth
[13:40:03] <taplar_tmp> 6 column, 3 lines
[13:40:13] <canine> so if someone closes all the divs on col-3
[13:40:14] <taplar_tmp> what is hidden?
[13:40:36] <canine> i will have 30 divs, 10 lines
[13:40:44] <canine> 3 lines will be displayed
[13:40:46] <canine> the others hidden
[13:41:03] <canine> so if you x out all the ones on column 3
[13:41:12] <canine> i need the ones on the other columns to show up
[13:41:17] <canine> in column 3
[13:41:29] <canine> well, I just need the first 3 lines not to shift
[13:41:34] <canine> the other ones does not matter
[13:41:38] <taplar_tmp> so that's what confuses me
[13:41:43] <taplar_tmp> if the others are hidden
[13:41:49] <taplar_tmp> why does it matter which one you pick?
[13:42:08] <canine> it doesnt, aslong as it is not from the first 3 lines
[13:42:20] <canine> i just thought last would make sense
[13:43:16] <taplar_tmp> ok, so once your down to only 3 lines of 6, and you remove one, what should happen?
[13:45:01] <canine> remove the div
[13:45:07] <canine> and keep the other ones in place
[13:45:19] <canine> or hide it
[13:45:22] <taplar_tmp> divs adjusting?
[13:45:27] <canine> perhaps visibility hidden
[13:45:41] <canine> id rather not have them adjust once they are down to 6
[13:45:49] <taplar_tmp> so there will be blank spaces
[13:45:54] <canine> yeah
[13:45:59] <canine> well i still havent decided
[13:46:10] <canine> i will probably end up doing whatever is easiest for now
[13:46:17] <canine> cant lose too much time on this heh
[13:46:36] <taplar_tmp> then really what i think you should consider doing is building your 3 rows of six, and then stick all the others in some single container
[13:46:48] <taplar_tmp> when you remove, remove or hide the clicked one
[13:46:55] <taplar_tmp> and if you still have one in your other contaienr, get one
[13:47:36] <taplar_tmp> then you don't have to care about which column
[13:47:41] <taplar_tmp> just hide me, and get another
[13:47:43] <taplar_tmp> if available
[13:51:25] <mentoc> I want to create a div with content from an ajax request. I want this div to be appended to another div and slide toggled down. Anyone know where do I start with this?
[13:51:38] <taplar_tmp> your ajax request
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> .done(function(data) {$('.theDiv').append(data)});
[13:51:47] <mentoc> I guess my first question is how do I dynamically create a div to fill with content?
[13:52:01] <robertmaxrees> var $myNewDiv = $('<div>');
[13:52:01] <mentoc> robertmaxrees: the div doesn't exist yet
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> $myNewDiv.append(data);
[13:52:19] <mentoc> wow
[13:52:25] <mentoc> it was that easy?
[13:52:28] <taplar_tmp> you blew his mind, :)
[13:52:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:53:12] <mentoc> lol he really did taplar
[13:53:20] <taplar_tmp> robert is a mad blower
[13:53:22] <taplar_tmp> of minds
[13:53:34] <mentoc> Okay now how do I slide toggle this content onto the end of my div?
[13:54:07] <robertmaxrees> you set display: none; on it, append it, then slideToggle() it.
[13:54:31] <taplar_tmp> display:none you can do with hide()
[13:55:17] <taplar_tmp> canine: you good?
[13:55:27] <mentoc> Okay, I have one more question.
[13:55:37] <notchris> It’s like…..a div inside a div
[13:55:47] <canine> yeah im trying some things
[13:55:48] <notchris> *Queue inception music*
[13:56:33] <taplar_tmp> oh no, notchris is hitting the hash again
[13:56:50] <notchris> -_-
[13:57:04] <Dr-007> good evening. i've got a question. i'm using a plugin called tagit. in one document i'm binding the plugin to a textfield. in another document i'd like to add a callback to the already bound tagit.
[13:57:38] <taplar_tmp> canine: cool, we'll now i'm out for good for today, :P  later and good luck
[13:57:45] <canine> thanks again
[13:57:49] <taplar_tmp> sure
[13:58:43] <notchris> Dr-007: That plugin has callbacks...
[13:58:46] <notchris> Dr-007: afterTagAdded (function, Callback)
[13:59:17] <notchris> They also have… onTagExists (function, Callback)
[13:59:37] <notchris> Dr-007: https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it/blob/master/README.markdown#events
[13:59:54] <canine> taplar_tmp, it is all working fine, except when removing the last column
[13:59:59] <canine> im trying this:
[14:00:14] <canine> 			if (column == lastColumn || !lastColumn.length) {  $(column).detach(); }
[14:00:44] <n00bdev> can anyone explain to me how i get these 404 errors regarding 2 files? ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png and ui-bg_glass_100_fdf5ce_1x400.png?
[14:01:04] <notchris> Probably because either the file names are too intricate
[14:01:10] <notchris> Or because they are not linked correctly
[14:01:10] <canine> but not working
[14:01:16] <canine> oh he left
[14:01:34] <notchris> n00bdev: How are you refrencing the files?
[14:01:51] <notchris> referencing*
[14:02:00] <n00bdev> well im using autocomplete with jquery,jquery-ui and jquery-ujs
[14:02:10] <n00bdev> and rails-autocomplete
[14:02:12] <notchris> Did you check to see if the files exist
[14:02:19] <notchris> In the locations they are linking too
[14:03:11] <notchris> n00bdev: Here’s someone with your same issue - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9341794/jquery-datetimepicker-gives-404-not-found-png-files-error-on-firebug
[14:03:20] <notchris> And it’s answered too. Looks like a referencing issue.
[14:07:37] <n00bdev> notchris: cheers mate that was the fix
[14:45:51] <Dr-007> in one document i'm binding a plugin to a textfield. in another document i'd like to add a callback to the already bound plugin. is this possible?
[14:46:20] <Dr-007> when trying to do this. i override the already bound plugin in the first document
[15:08:03] <esaym153> Is JSON.stringify reliable on most browsers?

[22:18:47] <BenL90> hello, I want to ask, how to select element that after some id and before some id?
[22:18:58] <BenL90> is that possible?
[22:19:18] <nodist> yes
[22:19:35] <BenL90> nodist: How then?
[22:19:43] <nodist> but i would do as a child or a parent not both
[22:20:02] <nodist> so you would do $('#id').find(elm)
[22:20:13] <BenL90> nah that's the problem through
[22:20:26] <BenL90> I have quite problem with it :s
[22:20:34] <nodist> do you have a paste?
[22:20:36] <BenL90> I use Table to make some invoice work
[22:20:42] <BenL90> nodist: wait
[22:22:43] <BenL90> nodist: But I have some js plugins. AutoNum, is that possible to put it in fiddle anyway?
[22:22:48] <nodist> yes
[22:22:57] <BenL90> nodist: How :o
[22:23:00] <nodist> you could use a cdn and link to the plugin
[22:23:14] <nodist> its under external resources
[22:23:22] <BenL90> ok
[22:27:44] <BenL90> nodist: http://jsfiddle.net/cywfhwks/ Under update_total() function. I want to count the jumlah, PPN RP,diskon rp, and total rp only for item, the problem is they don't have same parents.. I need suggestion maybe?
[22:28:21] <BenL90> nodist: because when I choose the item, whole page change event the next item
[22:28:22] <nodist> im gonna need a minute to look
[22:28:32] <BenL90> nodist: Ok. Thanks!
[22:37:04] <nodist> theres alot here, im not sure if I can help within the next few minutes
[22:37:35] <BenL90> nodist: Can we do hack on it? I mean make the that some tr having same parents?
[22:37:51] <BenL90> nodist: I think that's the simplest option
[22:38:24] <nodist> you could try that
[22:38:49] <BenL90> I'm curious, But is that possible :s
[22:39:07] <BenL90> a <tr> under <tr> ?
[22:39:27] <nodist> yeah it would be $('tr > tr')
[22:39:59] <BenL90> but in HTML firefox that's not shown :s they seperated :o
[22:40:46] <nodist> you could do :nth-child
[22:41:03] <nodist> eg the second tr in the table would be $('tr:nth-child(2)')
[22:44:16] <BenL90> nodist: So the selector with select the second tr right? after the TR
