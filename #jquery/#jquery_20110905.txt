[00:01:41] <wkmanire> Is it really possible to survive on just beans, rice and potatos?
[00:02:00] <dr0id> yes
[00:02:02] <wkmanire> I've heard a person could survive on beans and water but that can't be tree.
[00:02:03] <wkmanire> true*
[00:02:05] <wkmanire> or tree
[00:07:25] <wkmanire> goodnight folks.
[00:14:46] <Thomas`-> coldhead, i've been trying to load a font from googles webfonts and only render text to the page when i know that font is set up for sure (so the user can't see it switch)..   found a javascript loader http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader.html and tried setting the font-font family and show the text in the completed callback but it still takes a few seconds to switch after that.  any chance you know any ideas which could make this
[00:14:46] <Thomas`->  transition nicer?
[00:21:03] <stede> hello, on which event i should bind to add post-data for an request of an ajax tab?
[00:22:19] <stede> if i bind it on tbasselect it works, but on first load it wont work because no tab was clicked
[00:23:10] <jrockjiggz> you can bind to a 'click' and then onDomReady $('tab').trigger('click')
[00:23:49] <ryanseddon> stede: do it on the tabscreate event
[00:24:24] <stede> jrockjiggz, the tab itself was show()'ed on a other click event. depending wich item is clicked i hafe to provide an id to the ajax request for the tab
[00:24:37] <stede> ryanseddon, i will test it ...
[00:27:44] <stede> ryanseddon, hmm .. wont work, because tabs are loaded already but hided. i use the tabs as a kind of slave-information from a master table. tabs are hide()'ed as long the user clicked a row of the master table. on that click i call .tabs('load',tabindex)
[00:29:46] <stede> so first time ele.tabs('load',0) was called together with ele.show()
[00:30:21] <jrockjiggz> $('#tabId').click( function(){ $.ajax({ url: 'http://', type: "GET", success: function(data){ $('table tbody tr td:first').html(data); }}); });
[00:30:47] <jrockjiggz> stede: post your code
[00:31:13] <stede> pastebin?
[00:32:57] <jrockjiggz> jsfiddle
[00:33:30] <stede> i will try
[00:34:08] <stede> i not used it very often - don't knwo how and which code to put there
[00:35:31] <coldhead> it has labels, you'll figure it out :D
[00:37:23] <stede> coldhead, sure ... but i wont get it to work anyway
[00:39:13] <stede> anyway ... hiere is the pastebin of the relevant code. http://pastebin.com/xtz24Lc9  i mean it is not necessary to post whole dom ... its not an issue of selectors are something else

[01:01:30] <carpediambaby> hi. is there a way to capture a click event using a div wrapping around an iframe? the iframe is not from the same domain.
[01:10:29] <jomofcw> Is it right : I cant put a null value in a JSON data format ?
[01:12:08] <nail_> no it's not
[01:13:24] <nail_> '{"a":null}' or even 'null' are perfectly valid
[01:14:23] <juha_> coldhead!
[01:14:24] <Lampoon> coldhead is great
[01:20:01] <jomofcw> thanks nail_ !
[01:20:35] <pom> I have an <a>-tag in the <th> of a table and want it to check all checkboxes in the corresponding <td> below. Anyone know a neat trick for this?
[01:24:25] <redfox75> hi, if I make $('#valoreMed_8').html("D") I can change the content of a cell, but How I can make if I have the ID element's name and id element's value in an array value?
[01:25:59] <redfox75> I would like to change using a intax like ...  $(this[2]).html(this[3]);
[01:26:09] <redfox75> sintax, sorry
[01:28:15] <muzone> At my mega dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/PQEq2/13/ - why does the JS calculate so much extra height at the bottom?
[01:31:00] <nail_> pom: something like $('.a_in_tr').click(function() { var $tds = $(this).parents('table').find('td:nth-child(' + ($(this).parent().index() + 1) + ')'); });
[01:31:03] <nail_> (to test)
[01:31:40] <nail_> maybe there's something shorter :)
[01:45:02] <pom> nail_: Thanks. you really hit the nail on the head there with that :nth-child. Success!
[01:49:17] <rickup> I actually have (what should be an easy jquery question) if anyone is up for it...  I have a select box  <select id="edit-attributes-43" name="attributes[43]">   I need any .live or .bind or whatever to a.) reload the page or b.) clear or reset the form
[01:58:57] <DarsVaeda> how can I find out why a selector does not select?
[02:10:22] <nail_> pom: welcome :)

[02:22:52] <TheDemz> Question: (This includes some ASP) I add an dynamic control inside a Dialog. The Problem is that the javacode isnt executed directly but first after i close then open the dialog. http://jsfiddle.net/JFTah/ what could cause to block the javascript som being executed? THX
[02:23:02] <Mike2k12> i have a site http://amigo.md/test/
[02:23:02] <Mike2k12> and i need to animate the circules
[02:23:02] <Mike2k12> the animation would look like its starts spining in a spiral from the center to the sides
[02:23:02] <Mike2k12> question -- how do i reveal the tail of the circle
[02:23:02] <Mike2k12> http://amigo.md/test/
[02:24:41] <Mike2k12> circles*
[02:25:00] <TheDemz> The javacode that is inside the dynamic control is what i want to be executed directly.
[02:28:17] <jrockjiggz> TheDemz: what js isn't being executed?  in the dialog?
[02:28:29] <jrockjiggz> buttons?
[02:29:41] <jrockjiggz> TheDemz: something liek this? http://weepy.github.com/jquery.path/
[02:30:51] <Mike2k12> cmon ppl
[02:31:22] <jrockjiggz> Mike2k12: http://motyar.blogspot.com/2010/04/jquery-animate-with-custom-paths.html
[02:31:26] <jrockjiggz> sorry the link was for you
[02:31:36] <jrockjiggz>  http://weepy.github.com/jquery.path/
[02:31:43] <jrockjiggz> its late...
[02:32:23] <Mike2k12> thanks
[02:34:23] <Mike2k12> the animation is cool but how do i reveal the background so it would look like the circles has a tail?
[02:34:53] <HBD> I'm writing a jquery plugin. Can I call another plugin (say display a jquery dialog) from my plugin?
[02:35:26] <DarsVaeda> I'm looking for a method to turn input fields into valid json, I most struggle with array fields now
[02:37:38] <Pitel> http://jqueryui.com/download -> quick download, still contains 1.8.15 in js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js !!!
[02:39:21] <Mike2k12> how can i reveal a image by moving a div(square) thru it?
[02:43:48] <Mike2k12> its like http://minimal.be/lab/jQuery.eraser/
[02:44:05] <Mike2k12> but instead of the mouse i would like to use a div
[02:44:22] <Mike2k12> no ideas?
[02:50:39] <cesera> I'd liek to serailize my sortable to something like the following: phones[][id]=<ID>&phones[][position]=<POSITION>. Do you think there's any point trying to get the serialize method to do this or should I just roll my own?
[03:16:05] <chachan> guys, how could I edit a CSS with this selector: "header .name:hover" ?, I tried overriding the hover event but it works only if I trigger it by myself. Any idea?
[03:19:28] <xec> chachan: this is a css question? do you have a live example of what you've tried?
[03:21:41] <chachan> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/8DDf2
[03:22:12] <chachan> xec: I want to edit/remove the :hover style
[03:22:38] <helpcrypto> hi...im using $("#formRequest").submit(function(){....and i have resturn false...should it cancel the sending?
[03:23:15] <xec> chachan: after you click on something? you're missing a . in ".name"?
[03:24:13] <chachan> xec: right, http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/8DDf2/1
[03:24:40] <helpcrypto> has anyone idea how to remove mozilla's/HTML5 keygen option "high"?
[03:24:57] <chachan> xec: do the click, and you will see that the border isn't removed
[03:25:30] <chachan> xec: you have to make the hover by yourself to trigger it =/
[03:25:53] <xec> chachan: like so? http://jsfiddle.net/8DDf2/3/
[03:26:01] <chachan> xec: is there a way to call the handlerIn?
[03:26:50] <xec> chachan: .hover is just a shortcut for .mouseenter() and .mouseleave() afaik
[03:26:58] <chachan> xec: yes, I don't know I just didn't do that before
[03:27:14] <chachan> xec: thanks!
[03:27:48] <xec> chachan: you could also do this: http://jsfiddle.net/8DDf2/4/
[03:27:51] <helpcrypto> ...im using $("#formRequest").submit(function(){....and i have resturn false...should it cancel the sending?
[03:27:53] <helpcrypto> has anyone idea how to remove mozilla's/HTML5 keygen option "high"?
[03:28:41] <xec> chachan: but you're going to stack events on top of each other for each click, maybe you'll want to unbind the click event after
[03:29:22] <chachan> xec: yes, I'm doing it :)
[03:29:30] <xec> right :)
[03:31:11] <xec> helpcrypto: assuming the submit event works, return false should stop the submission, yes
[03:31:36] <helpcrypto> doesnt...maybe its because my form has an action?
[03:32:07] <xec> no, that shouldn't matter afaik, what is "#formRequest"?
[03:33:01] <helpcrypto> the id of the form
[03:33:36] <xec> is it wrapped in ondomready?
[03:33:47] <Cracker2> ( var c = table.config; console.log(c); ) why console.log is returning 2 times, first an Object(it's ok) and then 2nd time 'undefined'
[03:33:48] <helpcrypto> maybe i should try using $.post or .ajax() to make the call...
[03:33:55] <Cracker2> if it's just a var
[03:34:01] <helpcrypto> its an "empty" html page...the only one form found
[03:34:14] <helpcrypto> and, the script is adding some inputs on it, so its woking
[03:34:43] <helpcrypto> lets check the html part....
[03:35:05] <helpcrypto> form method=post action=url...", and a submit button or a button with onclick?
[03:35:12] <helpcrypto> or form with onsubmit?
[03:36:04] <Cracker2> ohh nvm
[03:36:38] <xec> helpcrypto: paste your code into jsfiddle.net ?
[03:37:01] <xec> afk a little while
[03:37:25] <helpcrypto> xec...strat to think the problem is on the keygen object...
[03:39:10] <helpcrypto> ok...seems the keygen code wasnt working properly
[03:39:15] <helpcrypto> now it works
[03:39:31] <helpcrypto> thx for your help...now to check the next problem...
[03:40:03] <helpcrypto> consider i have an object
[03:40:11] <helpcrypto> and when i alert .html()
[03:40:31] <helpcrypto> i get 2 options <option>alto</option><option>bajo</option>
[03:41:00] <helpcrypto> should .remove(":contains('alto')") delete the first one?
[03:41:20] <B_Lizzard> Why does displaying a value of a JSON object with alert() work but returning the value returns "undefined"?
[03:41:30] <B_Lizzard> I am about to kill myself
[03:41:43] <helpcrypto> B_Lizzard: im almost sure, code blidness
[03:41:52] <B_Lizzard> Want the code snippet?
[03:42:05] <helpcrypto> you have alert(asdf); return asdf; ?
[03:42:19] <B_Lizzard> http://pastebin.com/NsHmzchZ
[03:42:41] <blackspotwiggins> B_Lizzard, ajax is async
[03:42:59] <blackspotwiggins> use deferred or pass the data on manually
[03:42:59] <B_Lizzard> Yeah, I know.
[03:43:08] <B_Lizzard> But it's in the callback function
[03:43:12] <blackspotwiggins> you cant return from success handler to the main function
[03:43:16] <B_Lizzard> The value exists, alert works every time.
[03:43:19] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[03:43:21] <helpcrypto> B_Lizzard: you cannot make a return for each
[03:43:22] <muzone> At my mega dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/PQEq2/14/ - I'm using height() to set my columns straight, but unfortunately it seems to catch some extra height at the bottom.
[03:43:25] <muzone> I tried with innerHeight() http://jsfiddle.net/PQEq2/15/ - but that had its own set of problems.
[03:43:38] <huma> toggle doesn't work with clicks anymore?
[03:43:39] <helpcrypto> B_Lizzard: you have to return "only once"
[03:43:46] <blackspotwiggins> ?ajax101 @ B_Lizzard
[03:43:47] <bot-t1> B_Lizzard, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[03:43:49] <B_Lizzard> Yeah, obviously.
[03:44:12] <helpcrypto> Put the return outside the each
[03:44:14] <B_Lizzard> Wouldn't the each loop just hit the return statement and then exit the function?
[03:44:22] <B_Lizzard> I did, but that didn't help.
[03:44:34] <xec> B_Lizzard: your return is inside the callback, so num_comments function has no idea what the value is
[03:44:36] <helpcrypto> B_Lizzard: ok...just think the following
[03:44:45] <blackspotwiggins> ugh, you cant return num_comments from ajax, period
[03:44:49] <helpcrypto> this line: $.getJSON('https://graph.facebook.com/?ids=' + url + '&callback=?', function(data) {
[03:44:54] <blackspotwiggins> handle it in the callback
[03:44:55] <helpcrypto> returns a json data, right?
[03:45:02] <B_Lizzard> Yes.
[03:45:10] <blackspotwiggins> helpcrypto, no
[03:45:11] <helpcrypto> then...DONT do the each
[03:45:13] <blackspotwiggins> it returns jqxhr
[03:45:35] <B_Lizzard> I use each because the key is a weird url
[03:45:36] <helpcrypto> return the data, and then process it
[03:45:52] <B_Lizzard> OK...
[03:45:56] <xec> sigh
[03:46:10] <B_Lizzard> I thought values were values.
[03:46:21] <xec> B_Lizzard: look at the link you got from bot-t1
[03:46:25] <helpcrypto> not if executed in other place
[03:46:32] <B_Lizzard> I'm not too experienced in javascript, but I'd guess it would work as in C.
[03:46:44] <blackspotwiggins> values are values, you dont understand async and/or closures
[03:46:49] <helpcrypto> if i send the callback an object, its a "copy", cause we dont share memory
[03:47:18] <helpcrypto> so, it should return data to a function on my client, and my function should handle that data
[03:47:49] <helpcrypto> anyway...ill ask my question again
[03:47:54] <B_Lizzard> OK, lemme try with .complete then.
[03:48:23] <helpcrypto> i have an html5/mozilla keygen element on my code. I want to remove the "high" option. can i?
[03:48:41] <helpcrypto> i tried $("#fieldKeyGen").remove(":contains('high')");
[03:48:54] <helpcrypto> but the keygen is removed, not the option
[03:49:11] <helpcrypto> its my selector incorrect?

[03:57:49] <helpcrypto> muzone...do you mean the blank space before first item on each submenu?
[03:58:13] <muzone> helpcrypto: no, inside the dropdown
[03:58:39] <helpcrypto> which one (i see it normal...)
[03:58:43] <muzone> helpcrypto: if you see the first space there, there's some extra space at the bottom there
[03:58:57] <muzone> helpcrypto: if you see the first JSFIDDLE there, there's some extra space at the bottom there
[03:59:20] <muzone> there's more space at the bottom than there is at the top
[03:59:21] <helpcrypto> no...i dont see it
[03:59:27] <helpcrypto> browser?
[04:01:46] <muzone> helpcrypto: firefox

[04:02:43] <edbaffei> I have some elements that are created via ajax, so they don't exist when the page loads. I'd like to add a click listener to these,.. but nothing happens since they don't exist when the page loads. How would one go about doing something like that.
[04:03:12] <helpcrypto> edbaffei: add the listener when created
[04:03:22] <blackspotwiggins> ?live @ edbaffei

[04:03:38] <blackspotwiggins> or slightly better, ?delegate @ edbaffei
[04:03:43] <helpcrypto> like $(button).click(function(){...});
[04:03:50] <blackspotwiggins> ehh

[04:06:49] <deam> does anyone know of a jquery workflow designer/tool?
[04:08:19] <muzone> helpcrypto: did that make sense?
[04:09:13] <helpcrypto> muzone: i see your problem, but dont see anything...
[04:09:29] <muzone> ah ok
[04:11:19] <helpcrypto> in fact, this: $("#main_menu > li > ul").height() seems to be returning too much size, isnt it?
[04:11:38] <muzone> yeah i think so
[04:11:39] <helpcrypto> if you use firebug, yull see what im talking about
[04:11:54] <muzone> i use firebug but i dont see what you're talking about
[04:13:04] <helpcrypto> i think the problem its the ul
[04:13:48] <B_Lizzard> The thing I don't understand is how do I pass the json data from the success handler to the .completed callback.
[04:14:10] <B_Lizzard> If the data is received async, I cannot just declare a var and assign it to the value I want
[04:14:20] <helpcrypto> muzone: until fixing...use h-30 :P
[04:14:25] <helpcrypto> i gotta go
[04:14:27] <B_Lizzard> And I cannot do var data = $.getJSON(...)
[04:14:28] <MatBoy> mhh I cannot find any dynamic inbox example using jquery :(
[04:14:48] <B_Lizzard> I think I need a coffee
[04:15:01] <Cork> B_Lizzard: why do you need to pass it cross those calls?
[04:15:01] <MatBoy> B_Lizzard: I have a jura ;)
[04:15:30] <B_Lizzard> Well, I need to return it from somewhere and I can't do it in the success handler
[04:15:50] <muzone> helpcrypto: thanks though
[04:15:50] <Cork> B_Lizzard you can just as well as you can from completed
[04:16:02] <Cork> B_Lizzard: its just a defered
[04:16:38] <MatBoy> mhh weird. Simple message system where you have your inbox is nowhere to find
[04:16:49] <Cork> B_Lizzard: and you can do success handling in completed if you prefer that
[04:16:58] <Cork> B_Lizzard: just check what result it has
[04:18:52] <B_Lizzard> The data is lost outside the success handler, no?
[04:19:14] <B_Lizzard> I mean, the getJSON function doesn't return it or anything.
[04:19:24] <blackspotwiggins> B_Lizzard, it doesnt have to return anything
[04:19:36] <blackspotwiggins> you deal with the data in the success/complete handlers
[04:20:50] <B_Lizzard> Under what name? The name I give to the success handler?
[04:21:03] <B_Lizzard> Sorry if I sound stupid, it's probably because I am.
[04:21:14] <Cork> B_Lizzard: its retured as an attribute to the function
[04:21:16] <muzone> At my mega dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/PQEq2/14/ - I use height() to make my column borders stretch all the way down - but unfortunately it adds some extra space at the bottom: http://home.no/mritz/megamenu.png. Is there any way to fix that?
[04:21:32] <B_Lizzard> Oh, shit
[04:21:37] <B_Lizzard> Just saw that.

[04:28:42] <zephir> hey guys
[04:28:50] <zephir> im using jquery mobile and have a basic question
[04:29:02] <zephir> my footer is not at the bottom of the screen
[04:29:10] <zephir> it seems to simply append to the height of the page div
[04:29:37] <zephir> how do i make it always appear at the very bottom of the screen ( no matter how much content i got)
[04:31:05] <B_Lizzard> Nope, can't find it.
[04:31:05] <B_Lizzard> nothing is returned other than the jqXHR object.
[04:31:05] <B_Lizzard> The examples in the docs don't help much either
[04:33:48] <Cork> zephir: you would have to use position: absolute or position: fixed
[04:35:57] <zephir> Cork:  solved it
[04:36:14] <zephir> by using footer div attribute --> data-position="fixed"
[04:37:08] <dismist> data-position?
[04:39:56] <zephir> yey
[04:40:02] <zephir> html5 jquery mobile stuff
[04:54:28] <larsemil> muzone: height() - 30 ?
[05:10:09] <noaXess> hey all
[05:12:15] <DarsVaeda> how do I select all fieldsets in a div (I know the id of the div)?
[05:12:41] <Cork> $('#id fieldset')
[05:13:12] <DarsVaeda> oh that easy? thanks
[05:16:51] <atmaniak> hi
[05:17:19] <atmaniak> how can i get the value of an input ?
[05:17:32] <damian004> .val()
[05:17:32] <atmaniak> (i want to add the value to my table after form submission via ajax)
[05:17:58] <damian004> var value1 = $('.element').val();
[05:18:00] <damian004> \o/
[05:18:02] <damian004> ~o~
[05:18:28] <atmaniak> damian004: ok, any way to access the element from another way ?
[05:18:46] <atmaniak> (i mean, i have to set an id to each form input ?)
[05:19:11] <damian004> hum
[05:19:29] <damian004> hm, id too
[05:19:59] <damian004> imo this is the best way
[05:20:59] <atmaniak> damian004: ok thx :)
[05:21:02] <donCams> atmaniak, $('form#yourformid input').val(); but id's the best way
[05:21:22] <donCams> since it just reverts to a native js method = document.getElementById
[05:22:13] <atmaniak> donCams: so, an id by input is the best way ?
[05:22:35] <donCams> yes. as damian004 has said. :)
[05:23:31] <donCams> atmaniak, also http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ haven't used that though.
[05:31:07] <damian004> donCams: thanks for serialize() ;>
[05:31:10] <damian004> it useful to me
[05:33:21] <donCams> damian004, cool :3
[05:43:55] <lux`> hi all
[05:44:13] <lux`> Is there a selector to select an option box with a determinated value attr?
[05:44:32] <lux`> e.g. <option value="10"></option>,  I need something like $("option value['10'])
[05:44:37] <lux`> ")*
[05:45:09] <angelkoilov> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[05:46:12] <lux`> thx
[05:52:03] <B_Lizzard> I finally found some kind of solution, but my problem is that the success or complete handlers still do not return correct data
[05:52:16] <B_Lizzard> Even if I just have it return an arbitrary static value
[05:57:04] <B_Lizzard> Isn't the .complete handler only launched after the getJSON request is finished and all data has been received?
[05:58:10] <Cork> its called when the connection is closed
[05:59:36] <B_Lizzard> So the data should all be there.
[06:00:18] <B_Lizzard> But even if it's not, why am I getting an undefined return value if all I'm doing is "return 20;", for instance.
[06:00:53] <B_Lizzard> Anywhere in the function after the getJSON call
[06:02:06] <B_Lizzard> async or not, I'm not asking it to return a variable.
[06:06:28] <tomasm-> once i have a field selected via field.select(), how do I UNselect it?
[06:06:49] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/ypnv5/ any one idea's i'm i on the good way?
[06:13:28] <B_Lizzard> This is retarded.
[06:13:29] <B_Lizzard> Or me.
[06:13:47] <B_Lizzard> It doesn't work even with async: false
[06:14:48] <MatBoy> does someone know an example that is completely free like this ? http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml?pr

[06:34:12] <kaolti> hey guys
[06:36:34] <kaolti> I have a form with 3 dropdowns, custom styled with jqtransform and I have to check if more than one dropdown is changed. The idea is that the user can submit the form only if only one dropdown has been changed
[06:36:54] <kaolti> I think it should be pretty easy to do with jQuery, any ideas?
[06:44:38] <Wiz-KeeD> Under SEH Team
[06:46:17] <Ankabout> can I use jquery (or even just css) to target the top 50% of an image for hover ?
[06:48:00] <Jonz> ankabout you can use jquery for that..
[06:48:24] <Jonz> you'd need to put in some code to figure out the height of the image and the coordinate that is being hovered over, and then execute your handler conditionally ..
[06:48:27] <Ankabout> Jonz, how would I go about that?
[06:49:02] <Jonz> events keep a .pageX and .pageY property
[06:51:31] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have elements that have two different classes, elements that only have class1 and elements that have class1 and class2...I want to select both variants seperatly, can I do that?
[06:54:42] <hooloovoo> DarsVaeda: Yes, yes you can.
[06:55:13] <DarsVaeda> I have no idea how, I have a selector for the case when an element has both classes $('element .class1 + class2)
[06:55:23] <hooloovoo> $(".class1:not(.class2)") for the ones only with class1 and $(".class1.class2") for the others
[06:56:00] <hooloovoo> or just $(".class2")
[06:56:03] <hooloovoo> could work too
[06:56:32] <Ankabout> Jonz, sorry but that's a bit beyond my knowledge... mind helping me if I set up a fiddle?
[06:56:32] <DarsVaeda> uhh yeah this works :)
[06:56:44] <hooloovoo> Goodie! =)
[06:56:59] <Jonz> ankabout sure, let me know when you've got one set up
[06:57:44] <Ankabout> Jonz, shouldn't take long, I have one almost ready
[07:02:54] <Ankabout> Jonz: http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/11/
[07:03:30] <Ankabout> the idea is that in the end, if I click the top half of the gray box, it will go up, and if I click the bottom half, it will go down
[07:04:43] <MoTiOnXml> isn't it good practice to assign explicit global vars to windows.*?
[07:04:53] <MoTiOnXml> i mean window.* obviously
[07:07:52] <Jonz> MoTiOnXml I don't think it's really required, "window." is assumed, unless you're in a scope where you might accidentally have something with the same name as the global..
[07:09:18] <kaolti> how can I check if 3 out of 4 phrases are present in a string?

[07:23:49] <Jonz> that should get you started
[07:27:16] <kaolti> I have 4 spans and I want to store the text from each span in a different variable, how can I?
[07:28:10] <muzone> fuck why is jsfiddle so damn slow??????????
[07:28:31] <muzone> it takes 30-60 seconds just to update the code!
[07:29:23] <Trisox> indeed slow shit
[07:29:25] <Trisox> got the same

[07:51:06] <espressive_> Hey there
[07:51:21] <espressive_> Which documentation tool does jQuery use?
[07:51:32] <Ankabout> Jonz, do you understand the rest of the code in that scrip?
[07:51:36] <Ankabout> script*
[07:51:37] <espressive_> I am trying to figure out what the 'standard' is, so to speak
[07:51:46] <espressive_> JSDoc or ....
[07:51:53] <Ankabout> kbochers helped me with it, and I get most of it, but there's something I can't figure out
[07:55:32] <Soothsayer> How do I decode a url encoded string? for example 'Let+the+PM+resign+first%2C' should become "Let the PM resign first "

[08:05:49] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with this script? http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/16/
[08:08:11] <hooloovoo> jsfiddle is slooow today.
[08:10:55] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, very
[08:15:02] <TrueColors> this isn't quite a jquery question, though sites like google and facebook usually have a static.url.com and their js and css files are often with random combination of characters - can someone explain why they do this?
[08:15:26] <TrueColors> for me... 19r2n2_12fewh9.css makes no sense to me and wouldn't make sense in my code unlike... core_site.css
[08:16:51] <Ankabout> TrueColors, I think it's cached css files
[08:17:28] <TrueColors> whats a static.url.com and random combination of characters got to do with cache?
[08:18:05] <blackspotwiggins> TrueColors, they are probably processing their static assets like css and js
[08:18:16] <nail_> it could be a new name for each new version of the file
[08:18:19] <Ankabout> the cached files have strange names and stuff
[08:18:21] <blackspotwiggins> the filename is meant to be unique so it can be cached
[08:18:32] <nail_> or a cached version of something generated server side
[08:18:49] <blackspotwiggins> and another domain is probably cdn or just another server for faster asset serving
[08:18:51] <Haprog> you can force "re-"download of any file (like css) by changing the filename/url when the file changes but have caching headers for a long period if the file stays the same.
[08:18:55] <hooloovoo> Ankabout: What are you trying to do?
[08:18:59] <TrueColors> yeah, it is generated serverside. Facebook uses rsrc.php and process a css url and js url in that.
[08:19:06] <Ankabout> when I have caching turned on, my css is cached and the names are like: css_7fN0P2FgqX-UTnEjtBuEOvfNeeVVVJBupLq56sZpKmA.css
[08:19:12] <Ankabout> TrueColors ^
[08:19:21] <TrueColors> and obviously php can send out a cached header.
[08:19:40] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, on each click, the boxes should move up one by one, like in thid fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/14/
[08:19:42] <TrueColors> i don't cache my css and js..
[08:19:44] <TrueColors> i don't believe.
[08:19:52] <blackspotwiggins> TrueColors, if you have old version of html in cache, it references old css - so that when you release an update old and new dont get mixed
[08:20:04] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, but I changed the markup a little, and moved the named anchors, and I can't get it to work now
[08:20:09] <TrueColors> i see.
[08:20:12] <blackspotwiggins> you should cache everything if you can
[08:20:26] <TrueColors> so when you see something like..
[08:20:27] <TrueColors> <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yh/r/u2OL99TwlfU.css" />
[08:20:40] <TrueColors> do they actually type that into the html?
[08:20:42] <hooloovoo> Ankabout: Why are you using mouse positions and stuff in there?
[08:20:43] <blackspotwiggins> no
[08:20:44] <blackspotwiggins> ofc not
[08:20:56] <Haprog> it's all automated ofc
[08:21:00] <Haprog> as much as possible
[08:21:09] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, because eventually, clicking in the top half will make it move up, and clicking in the bottom half will make it move down
[08:21:24] <hooloovoo> I see!
[08:21:50] <Ankabout> the solution, or just what I want to do?
[08:22:02] <hooloovoo> Ankabout: If no one has helped you by the time i get home from work i'll take a closer look.
[08:22:11] <hooloovoo> In 30 mins or so.
[08:22:15] <Ankabout> thanks
[08:23:14] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, just saw I have an error in my markup too
[08:23:18] <Ankabout> lemme fix that as well
[08:31:09] <adv_> i want to append a string like $('#footag').append( "<td>bar1</td><td>bar2</td>" ); only when the string "hey" is selected in a dropdown list
[08:31:12] <adv_> how can i do this?
[08:33:18] <adv_> what's the opposite of the append command? can i somehow remove what was appended?
[08:35:25] <thinkt4nk> adv_ remove the last children() element
[08:36:02] <adv_> thinkt4nk, how?
[08:36:04] <Haprog> thinkt4nk: not exactly the same if you appended more than one element
[08:36:37] <thinkt4nk> if you appended more than one direct child?
[08:36:45] <Haprog> yes
[08:36:47] <thinkt4nk> yes, that's true
[08:36:55] <Haprog> adv_: you would need to know what was appended, select it with a selector and remove
[08:37:21] <Haprog> easy if you append stuff with an easily identified wrapper or something like that
[08:37:38] <thinkt4nk> but adv_, if you only appended one element, you could simply remove the last element in children()
[08:37:48] <adv_> i append like $('#footag').append( "<td>bar1</td><td>bar2</td>" );
[08:38:11] <nail_> var foo = $( "<td>bar1</td><td>bar2</td>" ).appendTo('#footag')
[08:38:15] <thinkt4nk> in that case, use Haprog's approach
[08:38:16] <nail_> so you can play with later
[08:38:27] <nail_> with foo
[08:38:34] <thinkt4nk> ooh, even better
[08:39:02] <Haprog> like $('#footag').append('<div id="appended1">...</div>'); $('#appended1').remove();
[08:40:06] <Haprog> or if you append to an empty element you could just $('#footag').empty();
[08:42:14] <adv_> Haprog, can i have div inside a table element?
[08:42:40] <nail_> just use appendTo instead, no need of such workarounds
[08:42:40] <Haprog> hmm.. maybe not as a direct child
[08:43:29] <nail_> and that will work no matter how many elements your insert, and no matter _to_ how many you do too
[08:43:51] <Haprog> nail_: good solution. just read it.
[08:44:01] <adv_> nail_, so in your example i can do  foo.remove?
[08:45:44] <nail_> adv_: yes
[08:48:23] <adv_> how can i check if foo is defined?
[08:49:15] <thinkt4nk> adv_ typeof foo!=== 'undefined'
[08:49:20] <thinkt4nk> oops
[08:49:26] <thinkt4nk> typeof foo !== 'undefined'
[08:51:08] <MoTiOnXml> typeof(object) == typeof object?
[08:51:14] <MoTiOnXml> don't you need the parenthesis?
[08:51:19] <thinkt4nk> nope
[08:51:27] <MoTiOnXml> looks weird imo
[08:51:50] <thinkt4nk> I just got used to it with server-side js, since it's in wide use in that domain
[08:53:19] <thinkt4nk> I think ppl use it that way because it's close relative, instanceof is an operator
[08:56:36] <helpcrypto> hi again
[08:56:52] <Ebonwumon> Okay, so I have this site with a menu, essentially when you hover over #qod, #leaderboard pops up, and I want to make it so when you hover over #leaderboard it doesn't disappear in a couple seconds (as it would if you didn't hover over it)
[08:56:57] <helpcrypto> this morning i get stuck with a form that is not working when i send it using $.ajax
[08:57:05] <Ebonwumon> http://pastie.org/2486432
[08:57:16] <helpcrypto> so, my form sends the vars to the page and the page returns me a html with a code
[08:57:24] <Ebonwumon> That's my code, and it works except for hovering over #leaderboard doesn't stop the animation
[08:57:44] <helpcrypto> i want to call the page in the background, parse the result and, if correct show the code on my own
[08:57:57] <helpcrypto> is $.ajax what i have to use?
[09:02:53] <adv_> nail_, http://pastebin.com/Pdh6cvjv
[09:02:56] <adv_> doesnt work
[09:03:05] <beute> anyone here familiar with how i can make a cookie work globally (through my entire site) instead of just a single page?
[09:03:29] <beute> currently I am using $.cookie
[09:04:42] <nail_> adv_: where is that defined? if it's in a function foo2 won't be defined anymore if you call it another time
[09:04:54] <TrueColors> I did think of something to allow me to cache files, not sure if it actually works but: http://77.86.6.216/lastmod.php - php basically gets the last modified unix
[09:04:58] <TrueColors> timestamp of the file.
[09:04:59] <nail_> adv_: and foo2 is already a jquery object btw, no need to $()ize it
[09:05:20] <nail_> adv_: and I'm not sure to understand the logic in your "if it's not defined, remove it"
[09:05:22] <TrueColors> and puts that in a fake url, which the rsrc.php actually ignores that and only grabs the last element in the url (style.css)
[09:05:44] <adv_> nail_, well i want only to append that string if the dropdown list option selected is "list"
[09:06:58] <adv_> nail_, so i have a .change() with var option = $(this).attr("value"); . if list it should append, else it should remove (so page returns to the initial state)
[09:07:40] <beute> win. nvmd
[09:09:23] <nail_> adv_: that will give you an idea: http://jsfiddle.net/csJub/
[09:09:36] <rickup> If anyone is up for it...  I have a select box  <select id="edit-attributes-43" name="attributes[43]">   I need any .live or .bind or whatever works to a.) reload the page or b.) clear or reset the form
[09:09:45] <nail_> so you don't have any scope issue, but still don't use a global variable
[09:11:38] <rickup> ... that is whenever anyone selects any option
[09:11:53] <Ebonwumon> Does anyone have any idea why in this batch of code hovering over #leaderboard doesn't stop the animation?
[09:11:54] <Ebonwumon> http://pastie.org/2486432
[09:12:11] <Ebonwumon> the showing and the hiding works fine.
[09:12:52] <TrueColors> provide a jsfiddle of it
[09:12:56] <TrueColors> so we can see it in action.
[09:13:02] <TrueColors> that's how i work best ^.^
[09:13:20] <Ebonwumon> http://depotwarehouse.net
[09:13:31] <Ebonwumon> hover over "today's qod"
[09:13:38] <Ebonwumon> That's it in action
[09:14:19] <TrueColors> okay.. when i hover it drops down and when i go off of it..
[09:14:20] <TrueColors> it goes up?
[09:14:30] <Ebonwumon> Yep.
[09:14:39] <TrueColors> so whats the problem?
[09:14:50] <Ebonwumon> But what SHOULD happen is that when you hover over it, leaderboard drops down, then when you hover over leaderboard, leaderboard STAYS there.
[09:15:05] <TrueColors> oh yes i see.
[09:15:29] <Ebonwumon> The function itself works right, because if I change it so that it calls stopAnim when you hover over that stop button there, it works.
[09:15:47] <Ebonwumon> So it's something to do with hovering over leaderboard not actually calling the function, but I have no idea why.
[09:17:07] <pom> Is it possible to attach .live() before other .live() that has already been attached?
[09:17:27] <TrueColors> yeah it's not calling the function
[09:17:38] <TrueColors> I just placed an alert but that didn't do shit.
[09:17:45] <sean`> pom, nope
[09:18:13] <Ebonwumon> Yeah TrueColors I've tried that too. But I don't understand WHY it's not calling the function or how to go about fixing it.
[09:19:19] <lastent> Hi, do you know if there is any default method that checks if the key you pressed is a char key
[09:19:55] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, ping?
[09:20:23] <adv_> thanks nail_ !
[09:20:28] <Ebonwumon> lastent, I'd imagine you'd just have to get an onkeypress event and compare that to the unicode values for chars.
[09:25:25] <TrueColors> I'm not sure, I tried to do somethin Ebonwumon... but couldn't figure something out
[09:25:25] <TrueColors> but
[09:25:29] <TrueColors> you can do something with the html.
[09:25:58] <Ebonwumon> what is this something I could do?
[09:26:21] <Ankabout> can someone help me with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/17/
[09:26:25] <rickup> to make the select even show me an alert
[09:26:30] <rickup> oops
[09:26:38] <Ankabout> I want to find out how to change the cursor depending on where on the element you are
[09:26:40] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/3/
[09:26:45] <Ankabout> (different cursor for top half)
[09:26:54] <TrueColors> something like that Ebonwumon
[09:27:08] <TrueColors> of course I used divs for that, but yeah
[09:27:19] <TrueColors> of course, that's hardcoding and you can do it more dynamically
[09:28:07] <Ebonwumon> Actually...
[09:28:13] <Ebonwumon> That probably works out BETTER.
[09:28:21] <Ebonwumon> Thanks man.
[09:29:13] <TrueColors> let me try figure out the dynamic idea.
[09:32:04] <TrueColors> here we go Ebonwumon
[09:32:04] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/5/
[09:32:07] <TrueColors> two menu links
[09:32:27] <TrueColors> two drop downs... but same amount of code.
[09:32:53] <Ebonwumon> Man, if I implement this it's going to make the rest of the code in the project look like garbage =P
[09:32:54] <Ebonwumon> Thanks.
[09:33:15] <TrueColors> of course, I didn't use the two extra functions because I needed to access the hovered element by doing $(this)
[09:33:21] <TrueColors> so I did it like that
[09:34:31] <TrueColors> for the sake of it, I'm going to mess around a bit and make an actual nav ;P
[09:34:36] <tash1> would someone mind explaining to a newb how to setup a tooltip? If I hover over something with id of "test" ... would I do $("#test").tooltip("This is a test"); ?
[09:38:42] <angvent> How do I call a function with parameters in a callback? when i do  "Add": addConsentToList,  it works... but if i do  "Add": addConsentToList(id),   it doesnt work without any error...
[09:39:24] <Ankabout> tash1, I'm stealing a fiddle from TrueColors here, hope he doesn't mind, but I think if you have the plugin installed, this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/6/
[09:40:00] <Ankabout> sorry TrueColors, I should have copied it not saved, was too late when I noticed :S
[09:41:50] <tash1> Ankabout, what plugin are you referring to?
[09:42:10] <Ankabout> I think tooltip() is a plugin, not standard in jquery
[09:42:18] <Ankabout> ?tooltip
[09:42:18] <bot-t1> Plugins/Tooltip - Display a customized tooltip instead of the default one for every selected element. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip
[09:42:26] <Ankabout> tash ^
[09:43:02] <tash1> oh, gotcha, didn't realize that
[09:43:03] <tash1> thanks
[09:43:08] <Liveman> Hey guys
[09:43:14] <Liveman> can someone take a look at this for me?
[09:43:15] <Liveman> http://jsfiddle.net/9DDnL/8/
[09:48:48] <Ankabout> can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/19/
[09:49:35] <rickup> How can I cause a form or even a page reload if Value 2 3 or 4 are selected?  I finally got an alert out of this http://jsfiddle.net/vTssx/
[09:50:57] <adv_> nail_, http://pastebin.com/T2spf0Am why won't that wokr?
[09:51:00] <adv_> work *
[09:54:25] <gnarf> angvent: thats because you're passing the result of addConsentToList( id ) as the callback
[09:54:28] <gnarf> not the function
[09:55:14] <gnarf> angvent: try { Add: function() { addConsentToList.call( this, id ); } }
[09:55:15] <Ankabout> .animate({ scrollTop: 600 }, 1000);   how can I do the opposite of this?
[09:55:26] <gnarf> Ankabout: what would the opposite of that be?
[09:55:41] <Ankabout> well right now this makes an element move up in my page
[09:55:44] <Ankabout> I need it to move down
[09:55:53] <gnarf> you can't animate scrollTop below 0
[09:56:05] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/19/
[09:56:10] <Ankabout> gnarf ^
[09:56:29] <Ankabout> if you click the top of the image, it moves up (yay). how do I move it down when you click the bottom?
[09:56:48] <gnarf> Ankabout: so, animate it to the other position?
[09:57:11] <TrueColors> finally, here we go Ebonwumon: http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/24/
[09:57:18] <TrueColors> I messed up the html and css
[09:57:22] <TrueColors> too tired...
[09:57:24] * TrueColors yawns
[09:57:24] <Ankabout> gnarf, I'm not really sure how to do that...
[09:57:43] <gnarf> Ankabout: scrollTo = nextImage.length ? $this.outerHeight() * imageNum + imageNum * 20 : 0;
[09:57:57] <gnarf> you should be able to use a different "imageNum" there right?
[09:58:02] <Ebonwumon> TrueColors, you didn't have to do that >.<
[09:58:08] <Ebonwumon> Divs worked fine.
[09:58:11] <TrueColors> I was bored but I messed up badly during it
[09:58:15] <Ankabout> hmmm that's an idea
[09:58:17] <gnarf> i mean, imageNum = 0 gives you the first
[09:58:17] <Ankabout> lemme try that
[09:58:25] <gnarf> imageNum = 2 gives you the "last
[09:58:45] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/uy8en/ why wont that work?
[09:58:52] <gnarf> i would say you rewrite that function to take an image number
[09:59:04] <gnarf> and then call it from your click handler
[09:59:20] <gnarf> instead of making the click handler be the thing actually doing the animation
[09:59:28] <eighty4> Could anyone explain this "because the jquery has to respond to an event rather than execute as its fed into the interpreter" Would this mean that if I do $.somefunction() that won't trigger directly?
[09:59:42] <Ankabout> gnarf, I didn't write this, someone helped me with it... so I'm not sure how to go about that
[09:59:52] <gnarf> write like function setImageNum( number ) { number = number % images.length }
[09:59:58] <gnarf> then do the rest of the shit
[10:00:10] <gnarf> Ankabout: well, no time like now to try to figure it out right? :)
[10:00:24] <Ankabout> lol true
[10:02:54] <adv_> anyone?
[10:03:47] <Ankabout> adv_ you need a document ready don't you?
[10:04:01] <adv_> Ankabout, hm?
[10:04:37] <TrueColors> Ok there Ebonwumon, http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/33/ same result - divs.
[10:05:14] <Ebonwumon> I think you need a personal project.
[10:05:21] <TrueColors> i've got a few
[10:05:22] <TrueColors> drive me nuts
[10:05:26] <Ebonwumon> You seem to have a lot of love to give out, and it should be on your baby, not mine.
[10:06:04] <Ankabout> adv_, oh nevermind, that doesn't work either... no idea
[10:09:28] <TrueColors> and to go even further, Ebonwumon ... http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/41/
[10:09:29] <TrueColors> lol
[10:09:32] <TrueColors> imma stop now.
[10:10:47] <TrueColors> I would also recommend doing a position: relative; z-index: 1; on the subnavs.
[10:10:54] <TrueColors> no, a z-index: 2;
[10:11:37] <nail_> adv_: well first "alltag" will try to select <alltag> elements, you probably want .alltag or #alltag, then id="recttag alltag" is wrong too
[10:12:00] <TrueColors> I mean a position: absolute
[10:12:48] <adv_> nail_, why is it wrong?
[10:13:17] <TrueColors> Like this Ebonwumon: http://jsfiddle.net/q6wUE/49/ - so the dropdowns don't effect the rest of hte page.
[10:13:17] <nail_> space is not a valid character in an id
[10:13:20] <adv_> with #alltag it fails too
[10:13:28] <nail_> maybe you meant class instead of id ?
[10:14:15] <adv_> oh yes
[10:14:38] <nail_> then select '.alltags' and wrap that in a <table> and that will work
[10:14:55] <nail_> alltag
[10:16:44] <adv_> thanks nail_ !
[10:17:06] <nail_> np
[10:18:34] <rickup> anyone interested in making a few bucks today take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/vTssx/3/  and let me know
[10:19:44] <TrueColors> whats it meant to do
[10:19:56] <nail_> I took a look, how do we arrange? :-)
[10:20:01] <rickup> TrueColors, was that to me?
[10:20:04] <TrueColors> yea
[10:20:14] <rickup> yeah I need it extended a bit
[10:20:15] <gnarf> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/20/ maybe my suggestion makes more sense now?
[10:20:19] <nail_> I can refresh for 5 more bucks
[10:20:20] <nail_> oh
[10:21:37] <Ankabout> gnarf, your suggestion made sense already, I just don't have the know-how, so was trying to figure out how
[10:21:42] <Ankabout> but thanks, this should help a lot
[10:21:43] <rickup> ok this is the problem - 1 .) the demo works fine but on the real page not yet and 2.) make it first alert  then clear / refresh page or form
[10:22:02] <Ankabout> not 100% yet (should only go up one image or down one image) but I can figure that out I hope :)
[10:22:16] <gnarf> like you don't want the loop around?
[10:23:08] <gnarf> replace imageNumber = ( imageNumber + images.length ) % images.length;  with imageNumber = imageNumber < 0 ? 0 : imageNumber >= images.length: images.length - 1 : imageNumber;
[10:24:08] <gnarf> sry - typo: imageNumber = imageNumber < 0 ? 0 : imageNumber >= images.length ? images.length - 1 : imageNumber;
[10:24:31] <gnarf> or even Math.min( Math.max( 0, imageNumber), images.length - 1 )
[10:27:04] <Ankabout> I copy-pasted that gnarf
[10:27:11] <Ankabout> have to leave for an hour, but will check when I get back
[10:27:13] <Ankabout> thanks a lot@
[10:27:16] <Ankabout> @ = !
[10:29:03] <adv_> i want to execute a line only when the page loads (once)  , how can i do this?
[10:30:18] <djQuery> adv_: then just do $(document).load(funciton(){ /* your line */})
[10:32:16] <gnarf> adv_: um <script>doSomething()</script>
[10:32:21] <gnarf> executes as it is read
[10:32:28] <gnarf> if you want the doc ready, use the doc ready
[10:32:40] <gnarf> doc load isn't as useful
[10:43:29] <TrueColors> My new ram is in. Who bets I'll have problems when I turn it on?
[10:56:01] <helpcrypto> hi again
[11:00:17] <helpcrypto> i have a POST form with some fileds. its working if i simply send, and im trying to do it "background", using ajax and retrieving the result in jquery, to parse it
[11:00:26] <helpcrypto> is $.ajax the correct way of doing it?
[11:00:57] <djQuery> helpcrypto: sure u can use post to do it.
[11:01:04] <djQuery> also see ?ajaxform
[11:01:05] <bot-t1> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[11:01:52] <helpcrypto> i have both used post and ajax
[11:01:57] <helpcrypto> and all i get is "error"
[11:02:15] <helpcrypto> (even, i dont receive any throwError info)
[11:02:53] <djQuery> ?demo@helpcrypto
[11:02:54] <bot-t1> helpcrypto, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:03:07] <helpcrypto> ok
[11:04:10] <helpcrypto> ill do it tomorrow (i dont have the code here), but more or less the question is: a common post form with inputs...should i use $(form).serialize to send the data?
[11:04:28] <helpcrypto> should i parte the data to an string(as seen on some examples)?
[11:06:03] <djQuery> $('#myform').post(function(){   $.post(this.action, $(this).serialize(), function(){/* do something here when its done.}   });
[11:06:27] <djQuery> helpcrypto: something like that ^^^
[11:06:41] <djQuery> ?.post@hepcrypto
[11:06:41] <bot-t1> hepcrypto, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:06:59] <djQuery> although I typicaly like the way that .ajax gives you more control
[11:07:19] <helpcrypto> thats what i got...but i always get error function callback run, with "error" and nothing on thrownError
[11:07:40] <helpcrypto> going to check it
[11:08:25] <helpcrypto> the only difference i have, its i use $.post
[11:15:52] <helpcrypto> thx all. going to review the code. will tell you tomorrow
[11:16:02] <helpcrypto> thx for your help
[11:16:05] <helpcrypto> nice day!
[11:18:06] <ryrych> I hope you will be interested: a jQuery UI mediabox  nice features and highly customizable  http://ryrych.github.com/rlightbox2/
[11:18:08] <ryrych> enjoy!
[11:20:13] <djQuery> ryrych: why does it scroll to the top when opening?
[11:21:05] <ryrych> djQuery: it's not a bug, it's a feature :D
[11:21:27] <djQuery> ryrych: how do I move to the next video in a set?
[11:21:45] <ryrych> djQuery: [N], []
[11:22:02] <ryrych> djQuery: I going to add little buttons in the bar
[11:22:09] <ryrych> in future
[11:22:22] <ryrych> but now it's time for feedback :)
[11:24:47] <ryrych> djQuery: do you like it? :D
[11:26:59] <ryrych> and where can I announce availability of a new jQuery UI widget?
[11:30:11] <djQuery> ryrych: you can put it on the plugins page?
[11:30:15] <djQuery> ?plugins
[11:30:17] <bot-t1> djQuery, Project types | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/
[11:30:44] <ryrych> sure
[11:31:27] <djQuery> might wanna see if you can get it posted to here http://www.jqueryplugins.com/
[11:31:54] <ryrych> djQuery: I don't want to bother you, but do you like it or not? I would like to get feedback :)
[11:32:06] <djQuery> it looks fine but to compete with the other plugins of this type think you hve a little work todo
[11:32:33] <djQuery> at least maybe since you are using the widget factory you can give a few more callbacks that others are missing
[11:33:14] <jrockjiggz> thats a nice domain name u got there
[11:33:26] <ryrych> djQuery: as far as I know there are very few pure UI widgets, almost basic jQuer
[11:34:02] <ryrych> *rather there are basic jQuery
[11:34:13] <djQuery> agreed I havent seen a slide show that uses ui yet
[11:34:43] <ryrych> djQuery: and thanks for the link :)
[11:34:48] <ryrych> I didn't know it
[11:36:21] <Axcy> Hello, can I ask validation questions here as well?
[11:36:33] <djQuery> without the ability for it to be embeded  and cylcing I dont know how many people will use it.
[11:36:59] <ryrych> djQuery: embedding? what do you mean?
[11:37:05] <djQuery> ryrych: ^^^
[11:37:49] <ryrych> djQuery: me is confused :)
[11:38:15] <muay-guy> hello nguys, I'm working with two forms (on the same page) and I use the same validator because they're practically the same, now when I get the error message, I get it for both forms, how can I tell jQuery to affect only the form I'm using? this is the code btw: http://jsfiddle.net/Wgj6K/
[11:38:28] <ryrych> djQuery: I gonna to improve it, this is only a starting point :)
[11:38:48] <djQuery> ryrych:    check out this one for some more ideas I particulary like the way it  autoplay next video when vid is finished http://css-tricks.com/examples/AnythingSlider/
[11:39:15] <imsky> :V
[11:39:46] <ryrych> djQuery: ah, I see, you mean a video queue?
[11:40:00] <djQuery> ryrych: kinda yeah
[11:40:23] <riskish> hi
[11:41:05] <djQuery> ryrych: also notica how it will pause a vid if you go to the next item in the show.
[11:41:47] <ryrych> djQuery: for me it rather falls under carousel category but I will take your advice into account :)
[11:43:24] <SinnerNyx> ok, so I'm new to jQuery in general. I'm trying to figure out how to get a jq-ui object into a variable so I can directly access it's properties. My code is "this.pb=$(id+' .pb').progressbar()", however when I later try "this.pb.value(50)" it fails
[11:43:46] <muay-guy> is there a way to select only the div.class I have in the current form I'm working on?
[11:44:16] <muay-guy> I have two forms and they share a warning message so right now when there's validation problems in one of them, the error messages show up in both
[11:44:23] <SinnerNyx> muay-guy, if you have the form then do this $(frmvar).children('div.class')
[11:44:26] <djQuery> SinnerNyx: see ?demo
[11:44:26] <bot-t1> SinnerNyx, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:45:26] <Axcy> Is there any way that in the "messages" part of the validation that I can make all radio buttons have a specific message?
[11:46:02] <Axcy> Like when validating my form, if the element is a radio button, it'll show the Message "Radio button must be chosen" instead of the default
[11:46:28] <djQuery> ?ui.progressbar
[11:46:29] <bot-t1> The progress bar is designed to simply display the current % complete for a process. http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/
[11:46:45] <djQuery> dangit where did bot-t go
[11:47:23] <muay-guy> SinnerNyx, I don't understand how would that apply. Did you see the code I sent?
[11:48:30] <djQuery> SinnerNyx:  get  $('selector').progressbar('value')       set $('selector').progressbar('value', 50)
[11:49:02] <SinnerNyx> muay-guy, i did not. apologies. just thought that would help.
[11:49:15] <SinnerNyx> djQuery, i'll try that one sec.

[11:49:58] <adv_> what does this do?         $.ajax({ url: 'wait.html', cache: false });
[11:50:15] <djQuery> adv_: nothing much
[11:51:29] <adv_> djQuery, meaning?
[11:51:46] <adv_> does it load wait.html?
[11:53:09] <djQuery> adv_: well since it doesnt have a :success or a error:    it just touches the wait.html and doesnt do anything regradless of wether it finds or theres an error
[11:54:04] <adv_> djQuery, but what does 'touches' mean?
[11:54:22] <riskish> what is the jquery function to do a mousehover and mouseclick state change of an image?

[13:02:40] <alabd1> djQuery: when we choose it return 09/13/2011 to filed but we want just return 13
[13:03:00] <Ankabout> gnarf, works perfectly, thanks a lot!
[13:03:05] <djQuery> alabd1: the formating options can do that
[13:03:17] <alabd1> djQuery:
[13:04:19] <alabd1> djQuery: which option
[13:05:30] <djQuery> alabd1: did you look at the see ?ui.datepicker page at all?
[13:05:31] <bot-t1> alabd1, The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[13:05:38] <djQuery> its the dateFormat option
[13:05:58] <alabd> yeah looked at it
[13:06:16] <djQuery> looks like you want $( ".selector" ).datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd' });
[13:06:26] <alabd> but someone told me it's not possible to return only day
[13:08:58] <djQuery> alabd: well its not imposible just stupid http://jsbin.com/onijij/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:09:15] <jdevel> you can get the day from the date..
[13:09:25] <djQuery> alabd: as the day has no bearing without the year and month
[13:09:36] <jdevel> ^
[13:09:52] <alabd> djQuery: thanks
[13:10:11] <jdevel> the date is taken from a timestamp anyhow.
[13:10:15] <Ankabout> gnarf, ping?
[13:10:23] <gnarf> sup?
[13:10:50] <Ankabout> I just tried the code from the fiddle (which worked perfectly there) on my site
[13:11:04] <Ankabout> and I ran into a problem, I think with the container.find() part...
[13:11:22] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/rVTNv/21/
[13:11:48] <Ankabout> problem is, on my site, the container being clicked is container .foo img
[13:12:17] <Ankabout> so one extra level down... should this work? images = container.find(".item img"),
[13:13:08] <gnarf> well the "container" should point to the outer scrolling thing
[13:13:13] <gnarf> cuz thats what it animates scroll on
[13:13:23] <Ankabout> yep, that works so far
[13:13:32] <gnarf> the "images" should point to whatever the inside object you want to count is
[13:13:34] <gnarf> like .item
[13:13:35] <Ankabout> and it scrolls, but it's not calculating the distance correctly
[13:13:52] <TrueColors> off-topic question: Why do people have urls like http://static.site.com ? what's the static all about?
[13:13:53] <gnarf> whats the height of .item?
[13:14:07] <gnarf> Ankabout: that distance calculation was a bit silly anyway
[13:14:16] <gnarf> lemme see if i can come up with a more accurate one
[13:14:37] <Ankabout> the height is variable
[13:14:40] <jdevel> sounds like the contents should be the same size as the container
[13:14:41] <Ankabout> pm?
[13:15:18] <jdevel> then make an inner div to contain the elements.. set the width or height = the total combined width or height plus their padding/margins no?
[13:15:58] <jdevel> the increment by the width/height of the container
[13:16:13] <djQuery> damn I hate it when I open a page and it takes 20 secs before I can scroll on it
[13:16:16] <Ankabout> oh wait... I'm an idiot... it should always scroll the same amount
[13:16:26] <jdevel> yes
[13:16:28] <TrueColors> idiot in the house :O
[13:16:31] <Ankabout> at the beginning it was variable, but we decided on a set height now
[13:16:31] <jdevel> +=amount
[13:16:36] <jdevel> -=amount
[13:17:20] <Ankabout> arg all this time to calculate it, all it needs to do is scroll the number * height
[13:17:42] <jdevel> indeed
[13:18:01] <jdevel> depending on the script you only need to use +=amount
[13:18:15] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/HMpKz/ - how do I center the dropdown menu (#main_menu > li > ul)?
[13:18:19] <muzone> Vaerros told me that since it's absolutely-positioned, I could give it a width, put left: 50%, margin-left: [width/2] on it - but I need something that works with all widths, as the menu might gain or lose another column.
[13:18:24] <muzone> Do I need jQuery for this?
[13:18:52] <djQuery> muzone: ?ui.position
[13:18:54] <jdevel> muzone, you can do left:50% padding-left: -(width/2)
[13:19:03] <jdevel> wait
[13:19:07] <jdevel> margin not padding
[13:19:13] <djQuery> muzone: see ?ui.position
[13:19:14] <bot-t1> muzone, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[13:19:38] <alabd> djQuery: how to remove September2011 above that windows ?
[13:19:54] <jdevel> aladb, check out the documentation
[13:20:04] <jdevel> they have all that on the UI docs
[13:20:19] <djQuery> alabd: what are u trying to accomplish?
[13:21:21] <jdevel> djQuery, it's fantastic that you are telling these guys how to do everything, but it is sort of giving a man a fish rather than teaching them how to fish..
[13:21:35] <muzone> thanks guys
[13:22:04] <gnarf> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rVTNv/22/
[13:22:12] <alabd> djQuery: a windows come up with just 1-30 number
[13:22:33] <muzone> djQuery: jQuery is my only option?
[13:22:37] <muzone> I cannot do this with CSS?
[13:22:48] <jdevel> muzone, I just told you how in CSS
[13:23:16] <glaksmono> anyone is here?
[13:23:17] <jdevel> position:absolute; left:50%; margin-left:-(half the width);
[13:23:25] <gnarf> jdevel: um... left/padding left? for
[13:23:30] <jdevel> margin..
[13:23:39] <gnarf> margin: 0 auto; width: whateverpx;
[13:23:42] <mytoz> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2963237
[13:23:55] <TrueColors> auto margins don't work with absolutes.
[13:23:57] <dcode> I got a question that I'm sure is something *very* simple, but I can't figure out how to even search for the answer. I have a div with several article children. Using jQuery, I append several more article children to this div. I know want to manipulate the entire set of articles (namely sort and some other stuff).
[13:24:09] <dcode> When I apply selectors, it only sees the stuff that is hard coded in the HTML
[13:24:15] <muzone> jdevel: You just repeated what I already said
[13:24:31] <dcode> how do I tell the selectors to look at the *current* state of the DOM?
[13:24:41] <jdevel> what's the issue?
[13:24:50] <muzone> I said my friend told me that since it's absolutely-positioned, I could give it a width, put left: 50%, margin-left: [width/2] on it - but I need something that works with all widths, as the menu might gain or lose another column.
[13:25:21] <dabear> man, didn't you just ask this question in ##javascript, muzone
[13:25:25] <jdevel> then take the computed style of the width and alter the CSS through javascript
[13:25:30] <jdevel> but the same logic applies.
[13:25:46] <jdevel> pretty simple
[13:26:10] <alabd> djQuery: like this but don't want year and month in title(orange)
[13:26:32] <alabd> don;t want the title at aall
[13:26:36] <jdevel> aladb, goto documentation on jquery UI
[13:26:51] <jdevel> read a little
[13:26:59] <gnarf> you could use { left: 25%; right: 25%; } and get a 50% wide centered box.
[13:27:16] <gnarf> with position absolutes
[13:27:21] <alabd> djQuery:  would you remove the part related to the title ?
[13:27:58] <djQuery> alabd: would I do it:? no I wouldnt
[13:28:41] <jdevel> you can also simply wrap it in a center tag..
[13:28:50] <jdevel> <center> this crap</center>
[13:28:57] <dcode> can anyone point me in the direction of documentation that explains how I can apply a selector to the current DOM after loading HTML and appending items using jQuery?
[13:29:50] <djQuery> if you incorrectly want to list the days of month why dont you just list a select with 0-31 or an <input type="number" min="1" max="31"  name="day"/>
[13:29:56] <alabd> djQuery: don't know java scripting to understand it , if could find the code related to orange bar would remove it
[13:30:15] <djQuery> alabd: we are here to help you not do it for you.
[13:30:22] <jdevel> probably handled in CSS no?
[13:30:30] <djQuery> alabd: see ?101

[13:32:32] <mytoz> does paul irish come around here often anymore?
[13:32:49] <Ankabout> thanks gnarf, I see what you did.
[13:33:20] <Ankabout> but I think I can get away with always scrolling 570px of height... we decided yesterday (me and the designer) that the height won't be variable any more, just the width
[13:33:35] <djQuery> .seen pual_irish
[13:33:36] <hsbot> pual_irish was seen 10 months, 2 weeks and 5 days ago, quitting with the message: Remote host closed the connection

[13:35:56] <alabd> is it possible to make these chart 3D ? http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/download/demo2/
[13:36:16] <alabd> if yes is there any guide?
[13:37:02] <djQuery> alabd: well anything is possibel
[13:37:41] <alabd> is there any guide for it ? how to 3d it
[13:38:29] <muzone> jdevel: Thanks man
[13:38:38] <amid_hasan> Does anyone know how to implement the real-time feed (fade-in fade-out records) thats shown on sites like foursquare and untappd?
[13:38:44] <muzone> jdevel: I still need UI's Position plugin though?
[13:40:17] <djQuery> alabd: http://www.jqplot.com/tests/   has some 3d pseudo effects applied to them
[13:43:20] <muzone> djQuery: At http://jsfiddle.net/HMpKz/ - I have some JS calculating the height of my columns. Couldn't I use something similar to calculate the width of the whole dropdown so I can center it?
[13:43:25] <muzone> jdevel?
[13:43:50] <muzone> My original question was: At http://jsfiddle.net/HMpKz/ - how do I center the dropdown menu (#main_menu > li > ul)? Friend of mine told me that since it's absolutely-positioned, I could give it a width, put left: 50%, margin-left: [width/2] on it - but I need something that works with all widths, as the menu might gain or lose another column.
[13:45:47] <alabd> djQuery: thanks
[13:46:09] <muzone> don't you all talk at once!!
[13:46:12] <alabd> djQuery: but there is no 3d example in link is there?
[13:47:53] <muzone> alabd: why you need that fake 3d?
[13:49:43] <alabd> muzone: because am asked
[13:49:51] <muzone> alabd: perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away
[13:50:12] <muzone> i say save time, look more pro and use 2d
[13:50:29] * muzone works at http://www.newtek.com so he could get fired for saying this:P
[13:50:59] <kh4n> hello guys, i'm trying to build a little bit more complex domobject with jquery, can u tell me what's the best practise here ? the chain of appends just doesn't seem right, or is it ok?
[13:51:01] <muzone> (we make the software that was used to make Avatar etc.)
[13:51:37] <dabear> how nice for you, and clearly relevant in this channel
[13:52:12] <kh4n> the other approach i think would be constructing strings representing desired html and after that create a jquery object from the raw html
[13:52:36] <kh4n> i'm kinda lost here, i need the code to be as clean as possible and i just cant figure out which solution is better
[13:52:52] <mytoz> kh4n: you could use templates, or do appends, or concatenate html
[13:53:26] <kh4n> mytoz: and from your point of view, which of those is the cleanest?
[13:53:31] <mytoz> if you're aiming for speed, concatenation works. if you're aiming for readability, templates are probably the best way
[13:53:41] <djQuery> ?tmpl@kh4n
[13:53:42] <bot-t1> kh4n, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[13:53:53] <dabear> kh4n: do as few appends as you can. raw string manipulation is way faster than creating many jquery objects
[13:54:03] <mytoz> but if you're not creating that many elements, and it won't make the code particularly complex, and performance isn't an issue, go with appends
[13:54:22] <mytoz> I'd go for templates
[13:54:57] <kh4n> detain: yeah i understand that the direct dom manipulation doesn't get me the best performance, yet creating raw html strings seems kinda messy, dunno why
[13:55:23] <djQuery> dabear: didnt think that .append had an issue until you actualy put the elements into the dom   $('<div></div>').append('wwwwwww').append('<ul'</ul>')
[13:55:39] <kh4n> mytoz: bot-t1: templates are looking as best option so far, however they're still beta, i don't like that that much
[13:56:07] <dabear> djQuery: not an issue, but string manipulation is still faster
[13:56:18] <dabear> ?bot @ kh4n
[13:56:18] <bot-t1> kh4n, sentient but living in the machine locale.
[13:56:30] <djQuery> kh4n: they are very stable. and there are some oterh great plugins built on top of them see ?knockout.js
[13:56:31] <bot-t1> kh4n, knockoutjs | jQuery Plugins - This plugin is meant to be used with KnockoutJS . http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/knockoutjs
[13:56:37] <mytoz> kh4n: yeah, beta is a slight issue
[13:56:38] <hooloovoo> Ankabout: I'm sorry, i was held up until now. I'll still help you out tho unless you've solved it. =)
[13:56:46] <Ankabout> haha no problem
[13:56:54] <Ankabout> i've gotten further, but I'm breaking it for some reason
[13:57:05] <Ankabout> gnarf did a great job cleaning it up for me, but 1 or 2 things don't work
[13:57:07] <kh4n> bot-t1:  djQuery: plugins is something i want to avoid as much as possible
[13:57:07] <bot-t1> kh4n, Stored "djQuery: plugins".
[13:57:14] <kh4n> those templates thou, are looking very good
[13:57:38] <dcode> So...I guess there's no way to use a selector on DOM elements inserted using jQuery? I've tried using holdReady() and live() but no dice. live() doesn't really seem to apply anyway because I don't have an event to listen for
[13:57:43] <davidw> hi - is there a way to get the text of a node, and only that node?
[13:57:43] <mytoz> tmpl lib seems stable regardless of beta
[13:57:49] <dabear> bot-t1: forget djQuery: plugin
[13:57:49] <bot-t1> dabear, I don't remember "djQuery: plugin".
[13:57:52] <dabear> bot-t1: forget djQuery: plugins
[13:57:53] <bot-t1> dabear, Forgot "djQuery: plugins".
[13:57:54] <davidw> .text() seems to include children; likewise contents()
[13:58:02] <jferg> Hi all - can anyone think of why the simplefade jquery plugin would cause a form input to not allow spaces?
[13:58:25] * mytoz has been working on a templating lib
[13:58:35] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, here's the code I have now: http://jsfiddle.net/G9mjQ/
[13:58:54] <dabear> davidw: not using jquery. but you can hack it
[13:59:10] <mytoz> it's still rather conceptual, and makes heavy use of the underscore lib
[13:59:27] <Ankabout> not the fiddle, this is when I copied it to my site, the working fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rVTNv/22/
[13:59:32] * djQuery bot-t forgot me :(
[13:59:51] <dabear> EVERYONE forgets about you

[14:01:46] <dmtrs> Hello people how are you doing?
[14:02:06] <kh4n> anyway, thanks for help guys
[14:02:07] <dmtrs> Is there any oficial resource to get a 32x32 jquery logo icon?
[14:02:24] <Ankabout> hooloovoo, pm?
[14:02:59] <hooloovoo> Ankabout: Sure
[14:05:24] <gnarf> Ankabout: why did you change it from a click on the container, into a click on the image?
[14:06:03] <gnarf> also - did you try looking for the outer thing not the img itself?
[14:06:07] <alabd> djQuery: thanks how to change 30 choice in this table to 12 choice ?mean it's enough for me to have 1-12 http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[14:06:17] <gnarf> the "div" that contains the image is as good as the actual image
[14:06:42] <djQuery> alabd: by rebuilding it from scratch
[14:06:55] <left-blank> hey guys, i'm looking to build an animation like this http://bit.ly/nZY4MW ... but using jQuery. i figured i will need to use some fancy maths to animate the curves, the scaling of the images, the speed at which they move any ideas how i could do this in jQuery?
[14:07:22] <left-blank> i was looking at jQuery.path, but that just seems to be for the path on which objects move...
[14:07:26] <Ankabout> gnarf, the image can be smaller in height than the container
[14:07:59] <Ankabout> I can send you the live link in pm, then you'll understand
[14:09:03] <dabear> davidw: iterate over its childNodes and check that childs nodeType
[14:09:39] <davidw> dabear, but I dont' want the childNodes
[14:10:18] <dabear> davidw: childNodes includes text children. those text children have a different nodeType than normal html elements
[14:10:41] <davidw> ah...aha
[14:16:51] <alabd> djQuery: thanks
[14:16:52] <dabear> davidw: http://jsfiddle.net/ccJcF/1/
[14:20:24] <djQuery> left-blank: you would have to use a canvas to do something like that I would think
[14:21:06] <davidw> dabear, thanks
[14:21:35] <dabear> np, actually quite fun to do things like that
[14:35:09] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/GQjp3/ - my JS changes "#main_menu ul" from "display: none" to "display: block" when hovered right? Is there any way to change it to "display: inline-block" instead?
[14:35:41] <djQuery> muzone: apply a css class to it?
[14:36:20] <muzone> djQuery: to what?
[14:36:42] <muzone> I haven't specified display: block, the JS does that.
[14:36:45] <muzone> (I think)
[14:37:58] <djQuery> $("ul",this).stop(true,true).slideDown(100).addClass('inlineblock')
[14:38:20] <djQuery> muzone: or $("ul",this).stop(true,true).slideDown(100).css('display': 'inline-block')
[14:38:39] <muzone> aaah
[14:38:45] <muzone> real nice djQuery !!
[14:38:46] <muzone> thanks man
[14:39:38] * muzone runs over to djQuery, hugs him and shakes his hand repeatedly while putting on a sick smile
[14:40:02] * muzone hands djQuery this as a token of his appreciation: http://home.no/dwaynie
[14:53:28] <marshy> i'm having a bitch of a time with variable scope
[14:53:59] * djQuery needs to go take a show to get rid of sick feeling now
[14:54:34] <djQuery> muzone: ^^^^
[14:54:42] <marshy> i define certain variables inside $(document).ready
[14:54:57] <marshy> and then i call a function
[14:55:04] <marshy> specifically jsTree
[14:55:11] <marshy> and then I bind some events to jsTree
[14:55:16] <marshy> and inside those event functions
[14:55:21] <marshy> i call the variables i defined
[14:55:24] <marshy> but they're undefined
[14:55:31] <marshy> i would expect them to be defined
[14:55:43] <marshy> since i defined them in the same $(document).ready
[14:55:52] <marshy> that i call those functions
[14:56:11] <djQuery> marshy: if you define the var as    var x = 1 inside of .ready it will only be available inside of the .ready
[14:56:30] <marshy> even if i call it from a function inside .ready
[14:56:48] <djQuery> if you define them as    x=1   then they will be available globaly     or even window.x = 1
[14:57:10] <marshy> interesting
[14:57:46] <marshy> omg ur right djQuery
[14:57:55] <marshy> i <3 u man
[14:58:02] <djQuery> marshy: yes its called scope
[14:58:33] <marshy> yes i know, but didn't realize the difference between var and no-var
[14:58:36] <returnMyRhino> hello, what is the best use of jquery on a website you guys have seen?
[14:59:09] <marshy> returnMyRhino: just google awesome jquery
[14:59:13] <marshy> and you'll get lots of good stuff
[14:59:17] <dcode> Hmmm....so in Firebug, I'm able to run a sort all DOM elements via a selector, both HTML in the webpage and those added via jQuery.....but I put that code in the webpage and it only sorts the elements that are in the HTML...
[14:59:34] <marshy> thank you djQuery
[14:59:48] <dcode> my guess is that because the other elements aren't loaded by the time the ready event is fired, I can't manipulate them directly
[15:01:04] <dcode> is there a way to get around this?
[15:03:24] <dcode> specifically...i have a div...with id "example". This div has some children article tags....I use jQuery to append to div#example...then after that, I try to do something simple like, $.("div#example").slice(5).hide(), but it only affects elements that were in the HTML webpage
[15:04:11] <dcode> sorry.... the selector is $("div#example>article").slice(5).hide()
[15:05:15] <flayks> hi there

[15:07:41] <dcode> It seems most people want to perform some event on inserted elements and so they're told to use live(), but I want this to happen when everything is done loading and sorted...is there an event for that?
[15:10:39] <dcode> Is it possible to re-trigger the ready event?
[15:11:30] <brennannovak> happy holidays, any of y'all "laboring" away at the codez? :P
[15:15:43] <dcode> AHA!!!  Got it. I put the additional code in $(window).load()...which fires after $(document).ready()
[15:18:23] <snover> thats not right at all. but enjoy.
[15:19:06] <SigmaProjects> If anyone has a second, is there any native (non-plugin) way to do something like $('#id').ready()?  An event register for when an element is added to the dom?
[15:21:36] <Jonz> SigmaProjects no not really
[15:21:42] <Jonz> thats not how events work in the document
[15:22:04] <Jonz> you could run an interval that constantly *checks* for that element
[15:22:24] <Jonz> but why can't you just attach your handler to the same code that adds the element with that id?
[15:23:09] <djQuery> SigmaProjects: gnarf has somethign that can handle that
[15:23:33] <djQuery> paging gnarf
[15:23:36] <SigmaProjects> Wanted to advoid doing it that way, but if its the only way its not a big deal
[15:23:49] <djQuery> SigmaProjects: its not
[15:24:00] <gnarf> sup
[15:24:14] <SigmaProjects> In a non-plugin way?
[15:24:23] <gnarf> ?newContent
[15:24:24] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[15:24:34] <gnarf> SigmaProjects: there is nothing native
[15:24:40] <djQuery> SigmaProjects: there ya go  very small plugin
[15:24:40] <gnarf> SigmaProjects: although you can trigger an event
[15:25:00] <gnarf> SigmaProjects: it will NEVER happen automaticall
[15:25:31] <dcode> snover, were you saying what I was doing isn't right?
[15:25:37] <SigmaProjects> hmm small
[15:25:46] <flayks> it's possible to detect the beginning of the panorama and the end when we scroll ? http://projets.flayks.com/pyreneesgraff/
[15:26:04] <SigmaProjects> thanks, newContent seems small enough
[15:26:12] <SigmaProjects> (tiny)
[15:26:54] <gnarf> SigmaProjects: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/crf3t/ take a look at that too
[15:27:19] <gnarf> SigmaProjects: .newContent() will work with content inside or outside of the dom
[15:27:28] <gnarf> though
[15:27:33] <gnarf> and its a little simpler
[15:27:41] <djQuery> gnarf: have you thought about putting together a fiddle or jsbin for that?
[15:27:52] <gnarf> what, newContent?
[15:28:25] <djQuery> yeah
[15:28:44] <djQuery> or a blog post
[15:28:49] <gnarf> *shrug* don't really see how one is needed
[15:29:12] <gnarf> i might put up a blog post about it at some point
[15:29:35] <gnarf> honestly though, i kinda take it for granted
[15:29:39] <david542> Hi, I am a newcomer to jquery...I have an input field like so -- <input type="text" name="key" value="" id="file_extension_input"> -- and I am using jQuery to populate the value. My question is how would I pre-pend a value to value, so the input value would be "david/$file_extension_input"
[15:29:40] <david542> instead of just the variable ?
[15:29:49] <gnarf> the gist does what i need it to for now
[15:31:09] <gnarf> i still gotta fix a "minor" bug in that imp
[15:31:12] <david542> basically, I nee to get file_extension_input as a variable instead of something that is automatically inserted into the input value. How would I do this?
[15:31:34] <gnarf> i don't know if the docready should be there or not
[15:31:37] <gnarf> prolly not
[15:32:07] <djQuery> david542: $('#file_extension_input').val('david/' + somevar)
[15:32:18] <gnarf> basically the problem with it is if you $("something").newContent( fn )
[15:32:24] <gnarf> it will call fn for any "something" it finds
[15:32:30] <gnarf> then on doc ready it will do it again
[15:32:46] <brennannovak> has anyone ever tried using jQuery UI Dialog with Plupload (an ajax file uploading plugin) ?
[15:32:47] <gnarf> just seems a little overkill
[15:32:54] <david542> djQuery: thanks
[15:33:05] <gnarf> actually, lemme remove the docready part right now
[15:33:18] <dcode> gnarf: btw, your gist is exactly what I needed
[15:33:22] <dcode> fixed my problem more cleanly
[15:34:31] <gnarf> i removed the document ready call
[15:34:36] <gnarf> at the bottom of the "plugin"
[15:35:08] <gnarf> but yeah, dcode its like live only not
[15:35:15] <gnarf> uses the same calling convention
[15:35:17] <gnarf> which i dig
[15:35:41] <dcode> gnarf: right
[15:35:54] <gnarf> just requires notifying newContent() of any new content
[15:36:50] <gnarf> some minor differences from .live --
[15:36:53] <gnarf> not many tho
[15:37:24] <gnarf> you can't like $("#container something").newContent( fn ); $("<something>").appendTo("#container").newContent()
[15:37:28] <gnarf> cuz it won't "find" it
[15:38:06] <gnarf> but it works for really simple selectors
[15:38:29] <gnarf> i kinda wish there was a .find() that would take a "full path" css selector instead of a "child selector"
[15:38:34] <gnarf> but we got what we got :)
[15:40:32] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/9/ for an example of what I'm talking about failing
[15:40:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[15:40:37] <ProLoser|Mobile> who's around?
[15:41:23] <gnarf> .find("*").filter( selector ) works though
[15:41:31] <gnarf> but i mean, do i really want to do that?
[15:41:53] <aaronmcadam> eeeee
[15:42:02] <gnarf> rrrrrrr
[15:42:33] <aaronmcadam> you not talking about the cb func you can pass to $.fn.html gnarf?
[15:43:16] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: nah, just like selector issues
[15:43:44] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:43:51] <aaronmcadam> you only wanna set the html once?
[15:44:03] <gnarf> no - dunno what you're talking about now :)
[15:44:10] <aaronmcadam> but implicit iteration is killing you?
[15:44:27] <aaronmcadam> I'm just surmising what I read on scrolling up
[15:44:34] <aaronmcadam> ignore me if i'm far off
[15:44:52] <gnarf> i was just saying I hate the fact that you can't $("<div id='container'><div></div></div>").find("#container div")
[15:45:03] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:45:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah you need to append to the dom before u can query it
[15:45:18] <aaronmcadam> spose that makes sense
[15:45:18] <gnarf> not true
[15:45:32] <aaronmcadam> well yeah actually
[15:45:32] <gnarf> you can't query that because "#container"  is [0]
[15:45:51] <gnarf> so #contianer).find("#container div") wont match
[15:46:09] <aaronmcadam> really now
[15:46:14] <gnarf> because "find" assumes all the selector parts MUST be children
[15:46:21] <gnarf> so its looking for a child #container div
[15:46:30] <aaronmcadam> I never realised that
[15:46:45] <aaronmcadam> what does filter do in this case?
[15:46:45] <gnarf> you can $("<div id='container'><div></div></div>").find("*").filter("#container div") and it works
[15:47:01] <aaronmcadam> you need that find step inbetween?
[15:47:13] <gnarf> yeah cuz its a child
[15:47:22] <gnarf> try it on console
[15:47:26] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:47:35] <gnarf> its just silly
[15:47:42] <aaronmcadam> tried any other libs?
[15:47:52] <gnarf> i just want a way for .find's selector to be a "root selector"
[15:47:57] <gnarf> instead of a "child selector"
[15:48:20] <aaronmcadam> hmm aj's not around to chip in
[15:48:51] <gnarf> the distinction makes sense
[15:48:55] <aaronmcadam> find* is a bit horrible
[15:49:02] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[15:49:07] <gnarf> calling the querySelector on the node
[15:49:10] <aaronmcadam> it's kind of "within this set, find this"
[15:49:13] <gnarf> it only looks at children
[15:49:19] <gnarf> yeah
[15:49:29] <gnarf> but the selector can't match parents "above"
[15:49:30] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:49:35] <gnarf> either
[15:49:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:49:47] <gnarf> even if its "#contained a"
[15:50:01] <gnarf> unless #contained is a child of the thing, .find() wont find it
[15:50:09] <gnarf> sucks
[15:50:11] <aaronmcadam> what does parent return in that case
[15:50:22] <aaronmcadam> or closest #container
[15:50:37] <gnarf> well closest("#container") is the actual container
[15:50:41] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:50:43] <gnarf> parent is null
[15:50:47] <aaronmcadam> and that returns?
[15:51:12] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[15:51:14] <gnarf> its in a doc frag off the edge of the dom, it has no parent
[15:51:18] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[15:51:26] <aaronmcadam> because it's not been appended?
[15:51:42] <gnarf> why should i need to append it then run a full selector
[15:51:43] <aaronmcadam> interesting idea
[15:51:48] <gnarf> i should be able to .find it
[15:51:50] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:51:51] <gnarf> but i can't
[15:52:00] <gnarf> i mean
[15:52:06] <gnarf> i wrote something a REALLY long time ago
[15:52:10] <gnarf> that split the selector on spaces
[15:52:12] <aaronmcadam> I'd try to do that same thing
[15:52:37] <gnarf> then did a bunch of .is() checks to see if the "parent" element was one of the parts of the selector
[15:52:50] <gnarf> but silly
[15:52:53] <gnarf> and buggy
[15:53:02] <aaronmcadam> well depending on what you want to do with #container
[15:53:28] <aaronmcadam> I'd usually use the $( '#container', { html : 'blabla', click : func() } ); pattern
[15:53:52] <gnarf> i'm talking on like an abstract level
[15:53:55] <aaronmcadam> but i get your point on arbitrary
[15:53:57] <aaronmcadam> yep
[15:54:02] <gnarf> ?newContent
[15:54:03] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[15:54:05] <gnarf> is what its related to
[15:54:21] <aaronmcadam> yeah I've always wanted to see if that was possible
[15:54:29] <aaronmcadam> firing an event on child mutation
[15:54:39] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: you have tomanually trigger it
[15:54:42] <gnarf> but its doable
[15:55:00] <gnarf> no good browser support for that event
[15:55:26] <gnarf> heres a use case
[15:55:33] <aaronmcadam> and delegate might not be what you want here either
[15:55:46] <aaronmcadam> i'd probably just use pubsub
[15:56:06] <aaronmcadam> in the method that adds the content
[15:56:15] <gnarf> $("#contentArea div.somethingSpecial").newContent( fn ); -- $.ajax("/url", function (data) { $(data).appendTo("#contentArea").newContent(); });
[15:56:21] <aaronmcadam> or else do something with backbone
[15:56:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah essentially that's what ur doing
[15:56:39] <aaronmcadam> publishing a newContent topic
[15:56:43] <gnarf> now in that particular case
[15:57:12] <gnarf> IF "data" contains "<div><div class='somethingSpecial'>" it will never find it
[15:57:15] <aaronmcadam> actually that *is* a pubsub pattern
[15:57:27] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: not really, there aren't more than one topic
[15:57:49] <aaronmcadam> still observer though
[15:57:57] <gnarf> sure
[15:57:57] <aaronmcadam> same thing hah
[15:57:59] <gnarf> not really
[15:58:13] <gnarf> pub/sub works on a published / subscribed "topic"
[15:58:15] <aaronmcadam> you don't necessarily need multiple topics
[15:58:24] <kkuno> hi
[15:58:35] <gnarf> also it doesn't take any extra arguments
[15:58:36] <gnarf> or data
[15:58:39] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:58:46] <kkuno> I need to toggle an element with animation
[15:58:57] <aaronmcadam> do u use phiggin's dojo port?
[15:59:15] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: nah, but its the pubsub i know
[15:59:33] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: i don't use pubsub anywhere right now, its a cool concept but i never really need it
[15:59:37] <david542> Hi, I am using django and trying to concatenate strings, with one variable from jquery, and another a python variable, how would I combine the strings, for example -- var filename = 'test'; $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#file_extension_input').val( {{ template_variable }} + filename) ?
[15:59:41] <kkuno> I want to use fade, hide, or slide using a var to decide
[15:59:43] <gnarf> none of my apps are large enough that it saves much of anything
[16:00:34] <kkuno> since the function is long, I need a var that can call the proper method
[16:00:48] <gnarf> ?p @kkuno
[16:00:49] <bot-t> kkuno, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:00:57] <aaronmcadam> you're lucky then gnarf ;)
[16:01:00] <gnarf> ?slideToggle @kkuno
[16:01:00] <bot-t> kkuno, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/

[16:01:08] <bot-t> kkuno, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:01:27] <aaronmcadam> I'm using pubsub for inter-view stuff with backbone
[16:01:34] <gnarf> yeah
[16:01:38] <gnarf> useful pattern for sue
[16:02:06] <kkuno> gnarf, yeah but I need something like:     func = hide;      func("slow",function(){........})
[16:02:11] <kkuno> but it doesn't work
[16:02:19] <aaronmcadam> it's nice that it's just pure func js, nothin to do with dom
[16:02:31] <kkuno> so I can set func as   hide, slide or fade
[16:03:17] <gnarf> something[func]("slow", callback);
[16:03:24] <gnarf> func="hide"
[16:03:43] <kkuno> what is something?
[16:03:50] <aaronmcadam> your object
[16:03:55] <aaronmcadam> with your funcs defined
[16:04:00] <gnarf> ?js func="test"; a={test: function() { console.log("called") }}; a[func]();
[16:04:01] <bot-t> gnarf: "called"
[16:05:01] <aaronmcadam> you use [] notation to programmatically call a key from an object literal kkuno ]
[16:05:06] <kkuno> ok
[16:05:12] <gnarf> s/literal//
[16:05:20] <aaronmcadam> a.test == a[test]
[16:05:27] <gnarf> a["test"]
[16:05:42] <aaronmcadam> or test as a var yepyep
[16:05:48] <kkuno> yeah but I don't think this can work with hide function
[16:05:55] <gnarf> kkuno: bullshit
[16:05:57] <kkuno> wait I'm trying
[16:05:59] <aaronmcadam> hahaha :D
[16:06:03] <kkuno> -.-
[16:06:06] <gnarf> ?tias
[16:06:07] <bot-t> Try It And See
[16:06:08] <gnarf> :)
[16:06:12] <aaronmcadam> a function is a function is a function
[16:06:13] <gnarf> if it doesn't work

[16:06:32] <aaronmcadam> yay
[16:06:39] <aaronmcadam> first class baby
[16:08:30] <kkuno> I am confused
[16:10:18] <aaronmcadam> aren't we all
[16:14:08] <kkuno> aaronmcadam, gnarf
[16:14:09] <kkuno> 							func = hide()
[16:14:09] <kkuno> 							$(trg).func('slow',function(){ (alert("hi!!!")) })
[16:14:17] <kkuno> tried this
[16:14:22] <kkuno> doesn't work
[16:15:26] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[16:15:48] <aaronmcadam> think bout that for a min
[16:16:00] <kkuno> mmmh
[16:16:29] <aaronmcadam> you're assigning the result of a hide function to a variable
[16:16:39] <aaronmcadam> var func = hide;
[16:17:18] <aaronmcadam> why aren't u using a toggle method for this
[16:17:31] <aaronmcadam> if you're switching between functions?
[16:17:38] <kkuno> toggle?
[16:17:48] <aaronmcadam> the api is your friend

[16:19:41] <kkuno> yeah, but... I didn't understand very much :|
[16:19:43] <gnarf> kkuno: func = "hide"; $(trg)[func]('slow', function(){ alert("test") });
[16:19:55] <gnarf> you can use a STRING to access the FUNCTION from the OBJECT and then CALL IT
[16:19:58] <kkuno> oh
[16:20:01] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:20:01] <gnarf> simple enough?
[16:20:07] <aaronmcadam> using () calls the method kkuno
[16:20:12] <aaronmcadam> that's not what u want

[16:21:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah it suckos
[16:21:07] <aaronmcadam> I want to adopt it tho
[16:21:16] <aaronmcadam> but can't find the source of it anywhere
[16:21:19] <gnarf> .toggle( speed, callback ) is basically either .hide( speed, callback ) or .show( speed, callback )
[16:21:32] <muay-guy> hey guys, can somebody tell me how should I have my invalidHandler lambda here so the error only works for the current form? http://jsfiddle.net/Wgj6K/5/
[16:21:34] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: its maintainer is afk for the last few months
[16:21:43] <aaronmcadam> yeah temp01
[16:21:53] <muay-guy> right now, when there are errors in one of the forms, both forms show error messages
[16:22:00] <aaronmcadam> gnarf can you change the event emitter?
[16:22:13] <aaronmcadam> ie. change the toggle from a click to something arbitrary?
[16:22:33] <aaronmcadam> ah, in your cb funcs right?
[16:22:34] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: .toggle( speed, callback ) is different than .toggle( callback, callback )
[16:22:35] <aaronmcadam> duh
[16:22:41] <aaronmcadam> aah cool
[16:22:50] <aaronmcadam> ah!
[16:22:51] <aaronmcadam> yeah :D
[16:22:54] <gnarf> but no, .toggle( cb, cb, cb ) only works on click i think
[16:22:54] <aaronmcadam> gotcha
[16:23:03] <aaronmcadam> right!
[16:23:05] <gnarf> the code for it is tiny though,
[16:23:55] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:24:03] <aaronmcadam> you'd think that should be an option
[16:24:20] <aaronmcadam> the event binding I mean
[16:24:28] <gnarf> $.fn.bindCircular = function ( eventType ) { var funcs = [].slice.apply( arguments, 1 ), current = 0; this.bind( eventType, function(){ funcs[ current++ ].apply( this, arguments ); }); };
[16:24:45] <gnarf> oops
[16:24:51] <gnarf> forgot the current = current % funcs.length
[16:24:55] <aaronmcadam> what is that [].slice.apply I've seen it loads
[16:24:59] <aaronmcadam> I did read it somewhere
[16:25:05] <gnarf> takes the "slice" function off an empty array
[16:25:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:25:10] <gnarf> and the applies it to the "arguments"
[16:25:14] <gnarf> which doesn't have "slice"
[16:25:16] <kkuno> ok thanks very much... I didn't know  that obj[func]  notation
[16:25:17] <muay-guy> how should I have my invalidHandler lambda here so the error only works for the current form? http://jsfiddle.net/Wgj6K/5/
[16:25:18] <aaronmcadam> instead of Array.prototype.slice
[16:25:32] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: compare the number of characters you needed to type for that
[16:25:34] <gnarf> :)
[16:25:37] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:25:45] <aaronmcadam> functional js ftw :)
[16:26:22] <aaronmcadam> cheers dude
[16:26:32] <gnarf> $.fn.bindCircular = function ( eventType ) { var funcs = [].slice.call( arguments, 1 ), current = 0; this.bind( eventType, function(){ funcs[ current++ ].apply( this, arguments ); current = current % funcs.length; }); };
[16:26:33] <gnarf> thre
[16:28:02] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/11/ @aaronmcadam
[16:28:09] <aaronmcadam> arguments, the Array-like object, like a fuckin super hero
[16:28:49] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: that's awesome!
[16:28:51] <Xenc> is function(blah) { if (blah) {  a good way to check for "blah"?
[16:29:11] <Xenc> or should i be doing typeof !== 'undefined'
[16:29:15] <aaronmcadam> yea
[16:29:20] <gnarf> Xenc: if you don't mind falsy values also failing
[16:29:27] <aaronmcadam> blah || return
[16:29:41] <Xenc> right
[16:29:47] <aaronmcadam> will work
[16:29:51] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: if(blah){} vs blah||return
[16:29:52] <aaronmcadam> meaning
[16:29:56] <gnarf> which is longer? :)
[16:30:03] <aaronmcadam> if !blah, return out
[16:30:19] <aaronmcadam> I like my whitespace gnarf ;) :D
[16:30:30] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: think minified tho
[16:30:31] <Xenc> so if (blah) is ok if i just wanna check for stuff, i dont want false or null to trigger it
[16:30:57] <gnarf> Xenc: also, easier to check blah !== undefined if you want 0 and false and null and shit
[16:31:04] <aaronmcadam> what we're saying is the other way around Xenc
[16:31:08] <Xenc> oh whoops
[16:31:18] <aaronmcadam> there's usually no need toh
[16:31:20] <aaronmcadam> tho*
[16:31:29] <Xenc> yeah i dont want 0 or false or null to be valid
[16:31:33] <aaronmcadam> if !var or if var is usally enough
[16:31:39] <gnarf> then if (blah) {}
[16:31:47] <gnarf> or even blah || return;
[16:31:52] <aaronmcadam> I do the other way around yeah
[16:31:54] <Xenc> but i get the difference now
[16:32:04] <aaronmcadam> cuz then you don't have to encapsulate ur code in a block
[16:32:28] <aaronmcadam> if blah is falsy, then the rest of ur code won't run Xenc
[16:32:35] <Xenc> oh really?
[16:32:36] <aaronmcadam> using blah || return;
[16:32:40] <Xenc> oh
[16:32:43] <Xenc> i see
[16:32:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah, it's doing it the other way around
[16:32:46] <Xenc> yea i want it to continue
[16:32:47] <aaronmcadam> see?
[16:32:57] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[16:32:57] <Xenc> thanks guys :D
[16:33:02] <gnarf> blah || continue; would work too i think
[16:33:18] <Xenc> yeah i cant use return as i want the statement to function even if it gets false or null
[16:33:22] <aaronmcadam> really?
[16:33:29] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[16:33:37] <coldhead> you guys are doing good labour
[16:33:39] <Xenc> { title: (text) ? text : 'default' }
[16:33:40] <coldhead> good work
[16:33:53] <gnarf> Xenc: { title: text || 'default' }
[16:34:00] <aaronmcadam> so why are you doing if (blah) then Xenc? something special if blah is truthy but otherwise do something else as well?
[16:34:01] <Xenc> even better
[16:34:05] <gnarf> if text is falsy, use 'default'
[16:34:12] <coldhead> text = 'default'; title = text;
[16:34:13] <aaronmcadam> yeptep
[16:34:15] <Xenc> aaronmcadam: it's a function input
[16:34:23] <aaronmcadam> cool braaah
[16:34:43] <Xenc> got it
[16:34:48] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:34:51] <Xenc> :D
[16:34:59] <gnarf> || and && are like twice as useful in js as most other languages
[16:35:05] <gnarf> cuz they return left and right side
[16:35:10] <gnarf> not bools
[16:35:27] <Xenc> yeah i like js
[16:35:29] <gnarf> ( a || b ) === a if its truthy, otherwise b
[16:35:37] <coldhead> i like turtles
[16:35:46] <gnarf> ( a && b ) === b if a is truthy, otherwise a
[16:36:09] <gnarf> and the RHS of those isn't evaluated in the second conditions either
[16:36:23] <gnarf> so ( a || func(b) ) wont call func if a is truthy
[16:36:27] <coldhead> ?eval (true && b)
[16:36:28] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: b is not defined
[16:36:34] <coldhead> :(
[16:36:47] <aaronmcadam> guys who don't kno this stuff: http://code.google.com/p/jslibs/wiki/JavascriptTips
[16:36:51] <coldhead> i'll never learn to script java!
[16:36:53] <gnarf> and ( a && func(b) ) wont call func >unless< a is truthy
[16:37:14] <aaronmcadam> coldhead check that page
[16:37:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah gnarf
[16:37:26] <aaronmcadam> I use that all over the place
[16:37:28] <aaronmcadam> for running funcs
[16:37:31] <aaronmcadam> cb funcs
[16:37:43] <gnarf> ?js function func( arg ) { console.log( arg ); }; a || func("||"); a && func("&&");
[16:37:44] <bot-t> gnarf: ReferenceError: a is not defined
[16:37:47] <gnarf> oops
[16:37:53] <gnarf> ?js function func( arg ) { console.log( arg ); }; a=true; a || func("||"); a && func("&&");
[16:37:55] <bot-t> gnarf: "&&"
[16:37:57] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: callback && typeof callback === 'function' && callback();
[16:38:09] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: callback & callback.call
[16:38:23] <gnarf> if you wanna check for ducks
[16:38:24] <gnarf> :)
[16:38:24] <aaronmcadam> I want the typeof check in there
[16:38:39] <aaronmcadam> and no need to change the this of it
[16:38:51] <gnarf> yeah, but if it has a "call" its prolly a function
[16:38:59] <aaronmcadam> ah yes
[16:39:04] <aaronmcadam> but not as obvious
[16:39:06] <gnarf> checking for ducks
[16:39:11] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:39:28] <aaronmcadam> what if some prick has added call to the prototype ;)
[16:40:40] <aaronmcadam> anyway think that's enough for me tonight
[16:40:54] <Xenc> cool link cheers
[16:41:03] <aaronmcadam> got what I wanted done: ubuntu notifcations for compass/sass compilations :D
[16:42:19] <aaronmcadam> anyone interested: https://gist.github.com/1195687
[16:42:33] <coldhead> thanks aaronmcadam
[16:42:52] <aaronmcadam> for saving you lines of code coldhead? :P
[16:43:24] <coldhead> for making me a better developer
[16:43:31] <coldhead> AND A BETTER CHRISTIAN
[16:43:34] <aaronmcadam> :O
[16:43:40] <coldhead> sorry i didn't mean to type that last part
[16:43:46] <aaronmcadam> damn u had to spoil it
[16:44:03] <aaronmcadam> I'm not a christian :P
[16:44:16] <coldhead> all JS devs are christian
[16:44:18] <coldhead> as far as i can tell
[16:44:25] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[16:44:33] <aaronmcadam> jesus.stringify()
[16:44:37] <aaronmcadam> nope
[16:44:50] <aaronmcadam> jesus.crucify() mmm :D
[16:44:56] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:45:02] <coldhead> so offensive :D
[16:45:08] <aaronmcadam> that's me :D
[16:45:19] <coldhead> allah.gravenimagify() // balance
[16:45:20] <aaronmcadam> are you using compass colhead
[16:45:36] <coldhead> actually allah.stringify() is probably offensive
[16:45:40] <coldhead> compass?
[16:45:44] <aaronmcadam> if u don't know what I'm talking bout
[16:45:47] <aaronmcadam> you should be
[16:46:03] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: http://compass-style.org/
[16:46:57] <aaronmcadam> you'll not want to write normal css again
[16:47:01] <coldhead> oh i misread you
[16:47:02] <aaronmcadam> get the fuck on it
[16:47:04] <aaronmcadam> :P
[16:47:10] <coldhead> i thought you asked if i WAS compass
[16:47:17] <aaronmcadam> :o hahah
[16:47:19] <coldhead> and i thought it might be some kind of christian sect
[16:47:31] <coldhead> and i was going to try offending them
[16:47:32] <aaronmcadam> so u are then
[16:47:37] <aaronmcadam> using it
[16:47:39] <gnarf> hrm
[16:47:47] <gnarf> why do i recognize felixge on github
[16:47:47] <coldhead> no i'm not allowed to use it
[16:48:12] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: is he a node guy
[16:48:18] <gnarf> yeah
[16:48:22] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: wtf? is ur mommy stopping u
[16:48:26] <gnarf> i think i've seen him around here tho
[16:48:31] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: guy from transloadit?
[16:48:42] <gnarf> maybe not the same github i'm thinking of then
[16:48:42] <aaronmcadam> he's on the nodeup podcast, really good
[16:49:03] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: nothin stoppin u using it for yourself
[16:49:38] <coldhead> a lack of ambition and talent that i could apply to my own hypothetical projects is stopping me
[16:49:55] <aaronmcadam> anyway if anyone is on ubuntu/mint, maaaybe debian and using compass check my gist

[16:53:37] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Ishmael - http://ishteva.tripod.com/ishmael.htm
[16:53:38] <lduros> hello, if I'm adding a function to my jquery plugin, should I use: var myFunc = function() { } or function myFunc() { }?
[16:54:00] <aaronmcadam> lduros I always use var myfunc = func...
[16:54:16] <aaronmcadam> because it makes it obvious that funcs are just objects
[16:54:21] <lduros> ok
[16:54:34] <lduros> so when you do function blah() {} within the plugin, it belongs to the plugin scope right?
[16:54:38] <aaronmcadam> mainly for teamwork reasons
[16:54:40] <lduros> I use var blah also
[16:54:56] <aaronmcadam> it's still scoped the same
[16:55:22] <aaronmcadam> anything defined under the plugin will be scoped to the plugin
[16:55:44] <lduros> ok, gotcha. thanks, i'll use var .... ;-)
[16:55:46] <aaronmcadam> actually I wonder if function myfunc.. gets hoisted into var myfunc - func
[16:55:51] <aaronmcadam> *= func
[16:56:06] <aaronmcadam> gnarf? ideas?
[16:56:16] <lduros> aaronmcadam: also, currently to refer to the this element of the plugin within that function, I use: var that = this;
[16:56:22] <lduros> and then use that within those functions
[16:56:23] <SIDU> coldhead: hi~
[16:56:26] <aaronmcadam> lduros: yeah it makes it obvious for people who don't really know js
[16:56:48] <aaronmcadam> lduros fine yeah, I use "self"
[16:56:52] <lduros> is this the proper way to refer to "this" within those functions, or is there a more "jquery" way?
[16:56:52] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: functions hoist
[16:57:00] <lduros> aaronmcadam: you mean var self = this?
[16:57:04] <aaronmcadam> aye
[16:57:19] <lduros> ok got you. thanks, still new to js in a way :-)
[16:57:35] <aaronmcadam> it's just conventions n stuff
[16:57:44] <aaronmcadam> the key is to pick one and stick to it
[16:57:46] <gnarf> ?js (function() { var test; console.log( test ); function test() {} })()
[16:57:47] <bot-t> gnarf: <function test() {}>
[16:57:53] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: did that answer your question?
[16:58:02] <aaronmcadam> gnarf I knew they would hoist
[16:58:27] <SIDU> howto get this: $('parent.main #id').html() ?
[16:58:35] <aaronmcadam> but I'm wondering if essentially, the parsers makes a function func into var func = function
[16:58:44] <SIDU> is jq working for a frame ?
[16:58:46] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: not quite, but sorta
[16:59:09] <gnarf> they interpret function statements as named functions which are assigned to the current scope
[16:59:21] <aaronmcadam> so defining a function like that inside an if statements will mean the func is undefined outside
[16:59:34] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: yes, as a statement
[16:59:37] <aaronmcadam> yep
[16:59:58] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: if you use a function expression, named - in IE6 it will pollute
[17:00:02] <gnarf> everywhere else your cool tho
[17:00:14] <aaronmcadam> i always use var f = func
[17:00:29] <gnarf> ?js (function() { var test = 1, test2=function test() { }; console.log(test); })();
[17:00:30] <bot-t> gnarf: 1
[17:00:35] <gnarf> in IE6 that would be the function
[17:00:42] <gnarf> as lame as that sounds
[17:00:43] <gnarf> :)
[17:00:59] <gnarf> ?g ie named function expression
[17:01:00] <bot-t> gnarf, Named function expressions demystified - http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
[17:01:09] <gnarf> http://kangax.github.com/nfe/#jscript-bugs
[17:01:30] <aaronmcadam> luckily I'm not writing code as silly as that :P
[17:01:39] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: :)
[17:01:52] <aaronmcadam> i don't tend to name the func inside
[17:01:59] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: i usually do
[17:02:09] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: makes console.log outputs of the function have a name
[17:02:11] <gnarf> which i like
[17:02:11] <aaronmcadam> var f = func f()
[17:02:15] <gnarf> yeah
[17:02:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah firefox already adds name property tho
[17:02:31] <gnarf> but you might as well just func f() at that point
[17:02:51] <aaronmcadam> yeah but var f = func f2()
[17:02:56] <aaronmcadam> which is what u were doing
[17:02:59] <aaronmcadam> that's silly
[17:02:59] <gnarf> right
[17:03:15] <aaronmcadam> surely that'd create 2 variables or something weird
[17:03:24] <gnarf> i prefer named function statements over anonymous function expressions
[17:03:27] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: only in ie6
[17:03:28] <gnarf> :)
[17:03:30] <aaronmcadam> f would be a reference to f2
[17:03:44] <aaronmcadam> right
[17:04:02] <aaronmcadam> that's cool
[17:04:15] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: in a "function expression" the name of the function should NOT be promoted to to the current scope
[17:04:25] <gnarf> but thats the bug
[17:04:32] <aaronmcadam> yes
[17:04:35] <gnarf> it also shouldn't act like a function statement -- hoisting -- etc
[17:04:44] <gnarf> but again, ie fails there
[17:04:48] <aaronmcadam> i thought the func name wasn't supported cross browser anyway
[17:05:06] <aaronmcadam> name property I mean
[17:05:20] <aaronmcadam> or is it not part of the spec can't remember which
[17:05:39] <aaronmcadam> but useful tip about the console.log
[17:05:42] <danieliser> using a custom modal script to load many types of content.. for example list of clients, click on a client and another modal loads with the client info. click the edit button to load an edit form etc.. how can i add a refresh to the client info when the edit closes? refresh the clients list when i add a new one etc
[17:06:11] <gnarf> aaron -- you'd only really do that when you want a nice name to refer to the function inside of the function
[17:06:20] <gnarf> like ?js (function a() { a() })()
[17:06:40] <aaronmcadam> could you do this.call for recursion?
[17:06:52] <gnarf> no
[17:06:53] <aaronmcadam> would that make sense?
[17:06:56] <gnarf> this != the function
[17:07:00] <aaronmcadam> ah
[17:07:18] <aaronmcadam> how would u do that with an anon func
[17:07:19] <aaronmcadam> ?
[17:07:22] <gnarf> NFE's are decent use, but IE behaves badly with em
[17:07:29] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: in strict mode, you can't
[17:07:35] <aaronmcadam> righttt
[17:07:36] <gnarf> but arguments.callee
[17:07:39] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[17:07:46] <aaronmcadam> that's on the road to deprecation right
[17:07:48] <gnarf> right
[17:07:58] <gnarf> which is why NFE's are useful
[17:08:12] <aaronmcadam> hmm but as long as you're smart and know what ur doing... ?
[17:08:39] * coldhead groans at Hornet
[17:08:43] <aaronmcadam> the problem for me is, the guys I work with barely know js
[17:08:54] <aaronmcadam> there's some really really shit code
[17:09:28] <aaronmcadam> so if I was depending on patterns like that which could break it's probably not wise
[17:10:17] <aaronmcadam> had one of em whinge at me for half a day about the context of this within callbacks
[17:10:27] <danieliser> any ideas on mine?
[17:10:37] <SIDU> coldhead: howto make parent.fr2#id.show() ?
[17:10:40] <aaronmcadam> to me it makes complete sense, but he was complainin all day
[17:10:57] <SIDU> coldhead: i guess jq does not support html frame ?
[17:11:59] <coldhead> it does, SIDU, but iframes are tricky
[17:12:07] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: are u gnarf.net?
[17:12:16] <coldhead> there are security issues
[17:12:17] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: yah
[17:12:30] <dnlmzw> Anyone can test something for me in IE8? I have been trying to handle this problem for almost 5 hours straight and im almost crying. http://swisscosmolab.com/temp/#/key-ingredients The different images disapeers when you go to another page and back again. I have traced in the console (IE developer tool) that the div .images goes outside of the window. I have tried everything, and it only appeers 2nd time you visit the page. Please. Someone help. I will be fore
[17:12:30] <dnlmzw> grateful!
[17:12:38] <aaronmcadam> cool dude just gonna give ye a wee follow, cheers for the clarification
[17:12:50] <coldhead> SIDU: if you have a reference to the frame try $('#someid', reference_to_frame)
[17:12:51] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: $.proxy :)
[17:13:02] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: if he has callback this issues
[17:13:09] <aaronmcadam> ah he just didn't understand it
[17:13:11] <aaronmcadam> simple as
[17:13:14] * gnarf grins

[17:13:28] <aaronmcadam> one of those blaming js things
[17:13:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah already gotcha
[17:13:47] <aaronmcadam> didn't kno u were on jq ui
[17:13:51] <coldhead> my site is still under construction
[17:14:04] <aaronmcadam> lol
[17:14:08] <aaronmcadam> dude are u serious :D
[17:14:30] <danieliser> my site is always under construction.
[17:14:32] <SIDU> coldhead: i made it this way : works :

[17:15:34] <coldhead> that's great, SIDU
[17:15:46] <aaronmcadam> what's ur twitters coldhead
[17:15:48] <coldhead> i just avoid frames altogether
[17:16:00] <coldhead> aaronmcadam: i'm not allowed on twitter
[17:16:11] <aaronmcadam> what *are* u allowed on
[17:16:15] <aaronmcadam> ur mammy is very strict
[17:16:23] <imsky> lol
[17:16:25] <danieliser> anybody have any ideas how i can solve my question above?
[17:16:30] <imsky> where's that banhammer
[17:16:43] <SIDU> coldhead: but: .find('#id') looks funny, is it  the correct way ? or better way ?
[17:17:10] <lduros> if you define a function as var blah = function() {} how can you call this very function from within itself (for recursive purposes)? tried "blah()" but it doesn't work
[17:17:15] <SIDU> coldhead: however it is a working way
[17:17:18] <danzik17> SIDU: Why does that look funny?
[17:17:22] <coldhead> SIDU: the way i showed you is better: $('#id', that.framey[0].documentystuff)
[17:17:23] <aaronmcadam> SIDU there is another way
[17:17:23] <dnlmzw> Someone here a master of IE8 optimization?
[17:17:31] <lduros> when you use function blah() {} then you can use blah(); within the function. but not with var blah = function() {}
[17:17:37] <aaronmcadam> SIDU, coldhead, that evaluated exactly to $.find
[17:17:47] <gnarf> lduros: untrue, it works for either
[17:17:57] <lduros> gnarf: really?
[17:17:58] <coldhead> it looks nicer
[17:18:01] <gnarf> ?p
[17:18:02] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:18:06] <gnarf> if you have a case it isn't working
[17:18:07] <aaronmcadam> lol coldhead
[17:18:11] <gnarf> let me see and i'll tell you why
[17:18:27] <lduros> gnarf: then why when I do: setTimeOut(addLetter, 500); I get setTimeOut is not defined? I guess ith as nothing to do with addLetter then
[17:18:35] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: after us talkin bout funcs for half an hour :D
[17:18:35] <gnarf> lduros: setTimeout?
[17:18:42] <danzik17> lduros: setTimout.
[17:18:45] <SIDU> danzik17: aaronmcadam . ok what will you write in jq: $(parent.frames['main'].document).find('#sql').show();
[17:19:00] <SIDU> danzik17: aaronmcadam . above is working though
[17:19:08] <lduros> gnarf: what?
[17:19:10] <aaronmcadam> so?
[17:19:10] <Lampoon> so are you
[17:19:11] <gnarf> lduros: case sensitive... setTimeout
[17:19:12] <SIDU> danzik17: aaronmcadam . i m trying to do the correct jq
[17:19:15] <lduros> ohhh
[17:19:23] <lduros> gnarf: got it :-)
[17:19:31] <gnarf> lduros: the error was quite descriptive
[17:19:37] <gnarf> setTimeOut wasn't defined
[17:19:39] <aaronmcadam> don't wanna even know why ur using frames
[17:19:57] <aaronmcadam> also, try to use window.setTimeout at least
[17:20:04] <lduros> gnarf: ok, funny that i guess timeout is one word then
[17:20:05] <lduros> :-)
[17:20:09] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: *shrug* window === global scope anyway
[17:20:18] <aaronmcadam> yeah but I like to be explicit
[17:20:23] <aaronmcadam> mainly for clearing them
[17:20:32] <danzik17> SIDU: That's correct pretty much.  Or you can do $('#main').contents().find('#sql').show(), but it has the same effect.
[17:20:44] <aaronmcadam> cuz it can get a bit unclear
[17:20:57] <SIDU> danzik17: ok thanks. looks like mine is better and shorter.
[17:21:13] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with just $('#sql')
[17:21:22] <gnarf> it doesn't search frames?
[17:21:22] <aaronmcadam> or are you searching within a bloody frame hehe
[17:21:41] <aaronmcadam> frames. let's go back to 97 :)
[17:21:42] <danieliser> calling a modal from a modal..the second is a form to update the first. how can i call back to the first to refresh itself?
[17:21:46] <SIDU> aaronmcadam: it is in another frame: parent.main.#sql
[17:21:57] <aaronmcadam> you're telling me too much about those damn frames :P
[17:22:11] <SIDU> aaronmcadam: calm down boy
[17:22:19] <aaronmcadam> phpmyadmin ripoff? :P
[17:23:05] <SIDU> aaronmcadam: but, what's wrong with frame? and i see html5 drop frame -- however i do not know the exact reason.
[17:23:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[17:23:17] <aaronmcadam> man
[17:23:27] <aaronmcadam> they're awesome
[17:23:30] <aaronmcadam> if u like shit
[17:23:36] <aaronmcadam> and working in 1997 :)
[17:23:39] <aaronmcadam> go for it :D
[17:23:50] <mytoz> personally, I like marquee and blink tags.
[17:24:06] <aaronmcadam> is blink still in ff6?
[17:24:09] <SIDU> aaronmcadam: there is only one reason i use frame , is that i can resize frame easily.
[17:24:15] <mytoz> aaronmcadam: not sure
[17:24:17] <aaronmcadam> ...
[17:24:20] <white_magic> how would i refer to a DOM element that has no 'name' or 'id' tag specified (but does have some specific tag 'x' specified)?
[17:24:44] <aaronmcadam> frames might still be acceptable for API docs at best
[17:24:55] <SIDU> aaronmcadam: ok hope you are happy
[17:25:11] <aaronmcadam> haha nevermind me
[17:26:09] <aaronmcadam> SIDU: http://apptools.com/rants/framesevil.php
[17:26:54] <white_magic> for example, if i had '<form class="xform" method="post" action="my.php">', how would i refer to THIS form, if the action="my.php" was the only unique thing about it?
[17:27:14] <aaronmcadam> form[action="my.php"]
[17:27:23] <white_magic> aha
[17:27:32] <aaronmcadam> no prob.
[17:27:37] <white_magic> thanks man
[17:27:43] <aaronmcadam> welcomeeee
[17:28:20] <white_magic> so would this statement be correct then: $(form[action="my.php"]).submit(function){DO STUFF();}; ?
[17:28:26] <white_magic> im very new to jquery
[17:28:28] <aaronmcadam> wrap selector in quotes
[17:28:29] <aaronmcadam> single
[17:28:55] <aaronmcadam> do u kno any js tho?
[17:29:10] <white_magic> yea
[17:29:13] <aaronmcadam> cool
[17:29:26] <coldhead> SIDU: frames are hard to work with, as i said
[17:29:35] <aaronmcadam> does it work yet
[17:29:40] <white_magic> so maybe like this: $('form[action="my.php"]').submit(function){DO STUFF();}; ?
[17:30:54] <gnarf> your () are all fed up white_magic
[17:31:00] <aaronmcadam> ur func definition is wrong
[17:31:01] <SIDU> coldhead: ok i with u
[17:31:03] <gnarf> .submit( functio() {} )
[17:31:07] <gnarf> .submit( function() {} )
[17:31:10] <aaronmcadam> hahe
[17:31:29] <aaronmcadam> var function = functio
[17:31:32] <SIDU> coldhead: thank you really very much . i think i have made my new boy now
[17:31:40] <gnarf> your passing a function to submit
[17:31:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah you don't need to put it in an anon
[17:32:00] <white_magic> yea had a few typos here in irc
[17:32:02] <aaronmcadam> if u define it
[17:32:04] <coldhead> you're*
[17:32:07] <white_magic> didnt copy & paste
[17:32:09] <aaronmcadam> submit( do_stuff );
[17:32:29] <aaronmcadam> see white_magic?
[17:32:36] <white_magic> yea
[17:32:48] <SIDU> coldhead: however it look urgly in windows. what's the best looking font in windows ? mono and non-mono
[17:32:52] <aaronmcadam> feck I need to go bedddd
[17:33:13] <aaronmcadam> consolas
[17:33:19] <aaronmcadam> monospace
[17:33:21] <SIDU> coldhead: what os are u on? windows or mac or linux ?
[17:33:23] <coldhead> SIDU: you should look at the google fonts, use something beautiful and unique
[17:33:32] <coldhead> i use linux
[17:33:45] <aaronmcadam> anyway, cheers gnarf I'm away
[17:33:48] <aaronmcadam> night guys
[17:34:08] <coldhead> gnight aaronmcadam
[17:34:38] <coldhead> SIDU: http://www.google.com/webfonts
[17:35:19] <SIDU> coldhead: that's a beautiful page. thanks
[17:35:46] <coldhead> http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono
[17:36:29] <SIDU> coldhead: well. i m choosing a better font for dummy like me who are using windows and who do not know what font is
[17:37:02] <SIDU> coldhead: sometimes i received complaints saying that my toy does not look good :)
[17:37:51] <SIDU> coldhead: so the best way is to include some nice font-family into css for windows users
[17:41:01] <SIDU> coldhead: thanks again 88
[17:43:51] <aro> how do i 'each' over a nested JS object?
[17:46:58] <aro> nvm
[17:50:23] <coldhead> aro: what's your solution?!
[17:53:04] <coldhead> heya Iszak

[18:07:51] <j2000> hi
[18:08:32] <j2000> i'm struggling to get some transparent PNGs doing an opacity fade in IE8. all the pngFix() type code I've tried crashes the browser (sometimes)
[18:08:39] <j2000> anyone any ideas please?
[18:15:07] <iMagdy> Hi
[18:15:12] <iMagdy> Anyobe available?
[18:15:27] <coldhead> sexually?
[18:15:35] <coldhead> pm me for cyber
[18:15:46] <iMagdy> I have a question regarding jQUery
[18:15:51] <iMagdy> *jQuery
[18:15:55] <coldhead> oh okay
[18:16:00] <iMagdy> Thanks
[18:16:03] <coldhead> and what is your question?
[18:16:23] <iMagdy> How do I set classes to list items dynamically
[18:16:28] <iMagdy> For example:
[18:16:49] <iMagdy> <li class="item-1"></li> <li class="item-2"></li> ...etc
[18:17:02] <iMagdy> In an unordered list
[18:17:06] <danzik17> iMagdy: see ?addClass
[18:17:08] <bot-t> iMagdy, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[18:17:31] <coldhead> $('li').each(function (i, elem) {$(elem).addClass('item-' + i);});
[18:17:56] <iMagdy> Thanks very very very very very much coldhead
[18:17:57] <buremba> Can I use live function with cookies?
[18:17:58] <iMagdy> :)
[18:18:13] <buremba> is there any way to track cookies lively
[18:18:51] <coldhead> you mean to bind events to fire when cookies are changed?
[18:19:16] <buremba> coldhead: yep
[18:19:24] <buremba> or setted
[18:19:46] <gnarf> buremba: you're the one setting them right? or are you talking about them being changed server side?
[18:19:52] <madprops> any idea why i'm getting a stackoverflow when trying to apply the timeago plugin from yarp, to approx 60 dates at once?
[18:20:29] <coldhead> madprops: sounds like a buggy plugin
[18:20:36] <buremba> I'm talking about client side
[18:20:44] <j2000> it seems if i want to lose the crashing, i need to lose my opacity fades, or drop the browser down to IE7 mode which seems to work ok
[18:20:53] <gnarf> buremba: the answer is still "no" but if you're the one setting them you can easily trigger an event
[18:21:09] <buremba> have have a cookie and when the cookie is setted I show a message and delete the cookie
[18:21:53] <iMagdy> Hi coldhead
[18:22:03] <iMagdy> I don't know why it didn't work :(
[18:22:18] <iMagdy> The element is selected using: .items ul li
[18:22:30] <iMagdy> So I did $('.items ul li').each(function (i, elem) { 	$(elem).addClass('item-' + i); });
[18:23:02] <coldhead> iMagdy: hold up
[18:23:10] <coldhead> i'll do you a demo
[18:23:16] <iMagdy> Ok, thank you :)
[18:23:31] <iMagdy> That's very very appreciated, thanks :)
[18:24:53] <iMagdy> My markup is <section class=items> <ul><li>Lorep ipsum....</li><li>Lorep ipsum....</li></ul></section>
[18:25:30] <coldhead> iMagdy: http://jsfiddle.net/vN5Lv/
[18:25:33] <coldhead> that works for me
[18:25:46] <coldhead> except it starts with item-0 because it's 0-based
[18:26:16] <coldhead> try reproducing your code on jsfiddle if it still doesn't work for you
[18:26:35] <iMagdy> You're awesome! :)
[18:31:46] <coldhead> To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to
[18:32:34] <iMagdy> coldhead: Works like a chart
[18:32:38] <iMagdy> *charm
[18:32:45] <iMagdy> Thanks so much for your help
[18:32:47] <coldhead> a charming chart
[18:32:49] <coldhead> good work
[18:32:51] <coldhead> my pleasure
[18:32:55] <iMagdy> :)
[18:37:52] <j2000> ;(
[18:38:33] <rickup> hello again
[18:38:50] <rickup> I have actually somehow solved my problem with a really ugly hack http://pastebin.com/SYS3Lfwc
[18:38:53] <courpse> how can i do: $('button').click(function() { alert($($(this).parent()+' .pages').html()); }); ?
[18:40:35] <rickup> it seems I must use the plugin that             $('form').clearForm()  calls as well as          	window.location.reload(); and the other stuff you see but this is so far from the point of ajax I feel like a moron
[18:40:45] <rickup> and I might be... its too soon to tell
[18:41:43] <rickup> so my question is "is there a better way than both clearing the form and reloading the page? "
[18:42:27] <danieliser> how can i test if an element has a specific .data() set?
[18:43:29] <coldhead> it's full of stars, my god, it's full of stars
[18:44:32] <danzik17> danieliser: Just call $(element).data('foo') - if it's undefined, it's not set.
[18:47:17] <danieliser> will if($(this).data('foo')){} work?
[18:47:51] <danzik17> danieliser: Sure.
[18:48:07] <danieliser> awesome..
[18:49:02] <gnarf> danieliser: var data = $(this).data(); if (data.foo) {} works too ;)
[18:49:08] <danieliser> what about checking if this has a parent with class of .container?
[18:49:09] <gnarf> then  you can save extra calls to .data()
[18:49:42] <gnarf> danieliser: .closest('.container').length
[18:49:53] <gnarf> ?closest
[18:49:53] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:50:02] <gnarf> that checks itself too
[18:50:04] <gnarf> just fyi
[18:50:11] <gnarf> if you specifically want parents only
[18:50:16] <gnarf> .parents('.container').length
[18:52:06] <coldhead> ?w check your head
[18:52:07] <bot-t> coldhead, Check Your Head - Check Your Head is the third studio album by the Beastie Boys, released on April 21, 1992. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Your_Head
[18:52:10] <danieliser> nice
[18:53:47] <danieliser> basically i have a method for my modals.. i set data on the link that opens it. the container.. so in my refresh function i check if this is the link, the container or the child of a container. i can then refresh the content in that one.
[18:54:16] <courpse> var y = $(this).parent().children('.pages'); i need to get the table which is the first child of the div with class pages
[18:54:37] <courpse> I tried with .get(0), i tried with .children('.pages table');
[18:54:42] <courpse> But both give errors, :/
[18:59:13] <ridethefire122> HELLO JQUERY! I have a brainteaser for you: Why does the first function cease to work properly when functions 2 and/or 3 are invoked? http://pastebin.com/HsiyjZzx
[19:00:34] <cpgo> how come doing a outerHeight() on a table that has a cpation returns the height of the thead and tbody only, it doesn't account for the height of the caption
[19:01:00] <coldhead> courpse: $('.pages table:first') ?
[19:01:08] <madprops> anybody knows an alternative to the yarp timeago plugin?
[19:01:12] <coldhead> you might want to try find() in place of children()
[19:01:16] <coldhead> they're different
[19:01:27] <courpse> Aww kk.
[19:01:49] <courpse> first or first-of-type?
[19:02:27] <courpse> first, awesome thanks m8.
[19:03:25] <coldhead> ridethefire122: i would guess it's because the first function is changing the DOM so the elements you're binding your handlers to are no longer in existence
[19:03:44] <coldhead> specifically this bit:  $(wrapper).find('a.jp-next')
[19:04:09] <coldhead> i would try $('a.jp-next').live('click', function () {... etc
[19:04:11] <coldhead> instead
[19:04:28] <coldhead> but then it will need some extra code to work out which elements to work on, probably
[19:04:32] <coldhead> see how you go
[19:04:41] <coldhead> ?live @ ridethefire122 HAPPYFUNBRO
[19:04:43] <bot-t> coldhead, Couldn't find "live @ ridethefire122 HAPPYFUNBRO" in jQuery Docs.
[19:04:49] <coldhead> ?live @ ridethefire122
[19:04:49] <bot-t> ridethefire122, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:04:51] <coldhead> lol
[19:04:56] <coldhead> ghosts of a once pagan place
[19:06:47] <coldhead> high in the architecture, something is moving
[19:08:44] <coldhead> peace, colkurtz
[19:16:02] <ridethefire122> coldhead I was wondering that as well
[19:16:18] <ridethefire122> I sorta verfied that changed handlers is not the case, but give me a sec
[19:17:16] <danzik17> ridethefire122: Can you make a jsfiddle test case?
[19:17:33] <ridethefire122> never used jsfiddle before
[19:18:08] <coldhead> you'll love it
[19:18:50] <ridethefire122> oh
[19:18:51] <ridethefire122> found it
[19:19:23] <ridethefire122> the next / previous click removes the span element
[19:20:21] <ridethefire122> ok
[19:20:22] <ridethefire122> cool
[19:20:28] <ridethefire122> now I can take the player live!
[19:21:52] <reedyseth> Have any of you have problemes with $(this) or html() in IE 9, it returns undefine
[19:24:46] <coldhead> reedyseth: eek, i've never seen that
[19:25:03] <coldhead> and i don't believe it's a known problem or people woulda fixed it quick smart
[19:25:10] <coldhead> can you get a demo up at jsfiddle?
[19:26:49] <reedyseth> coldhead: I have that problem, trying to get an info from a <p> and it returns undefine
[19:27:57] <coldhead> yes, that sounds terrible reedyseth
[19:28:33] <reedyseth> I know this is why I ask
[19:30:48] <coldhead> do you see what i'm asking?
[19:31:03] <coldhead> a test case will let us reproduce the problem and see what you are doing to trigger it
[19:31:18] <coldhead> otherwise we have to imagine, and it works fine when i imagine it
[19:32:11] <reedyseth> coldhead:Is part of a huge program, but I can paste where the problem fires
[19:33:08] <coldhead> if you can reproduce the problem on jsfiddle with as little code as possible, that would be best
[19:33:20] <coldhead> you can usually find and fix the problem when you reduce it
[19:37:58] <reedyseth> coldhead: you can see some part here http://jsfiddle.net/e4AMv/
[19:41:46] <reedyseth> coldhead: thanks anyways
[19:43:12] <coldhead> reedyseth: http://jsfiddle.net/e4AMv/1/
[19:43:20] <coldhead> oh
[19:43:26] <coldhead> bye forever, reedyseth
[19:43:29] <coldhead> you massive cunt
[19:50:08] <buremba> I delay an element like this: $(".box").delay('5000').slideUp('slow');
[19:50:21] <buremba> and I want to display another element after slideUp
[19:50:35] <buremba> what's the best way to do this?
[19:51:08] <buremba> Another delay function sounds like silly way to me.
[19:51:27] <coldhead> .slideUp('slow', function () {alert('i show when the slideup is done');})
[19:52:23] <buremba> hmm
[19:52:47] <buremba> coldhead: I couldn't think this way, thanks a lot
[19:53:15] <coldhead> ?slideup
[19:53:15] <bot-t> .slideUp([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[19:53:31] <coldhead> it's the callback, above, buremba ^^
[19:53:43] <coldhead> most jQuery animations let you provide one :)
[19:54:27] <buremba> I couldn't remember, sometimes it happens to me. :)
[19:54:47] <coldhead> brain injury?
[19:54:48] <coldhead> me too
[19:57:55] <coldhead> the future's hinting at itself

[20:21:05] <sixohquad> hey all, I'm having an issue with the validate plugin for jquery. I have a form that the user can choose the measurement units for, either metric or imperial. I want to be able to validate the form with different range's based on whether they chose metric or imperial
[20:21:27] <sixohquad> for instance, metric minimum width should be 200mm and imperial minimum width should be 8"
[20:21:50] <sixohquad> can anybody suggest how to change the validation rules based on which is selected?
[20:23:22] <coldhead> i think that's a case for the custom rules
[20:23:43] <coldhead> you will need to read the not so great docs on that
[20:28:53] <sixohquad> http://pastebin.com/wSa4L9b5
[20:29:00] <sixohquad> yeah, i've been racking my brain over them honestly
[20:29:11] <sixohquad> i just dont know how to change the options on the fly, you know?
[20:29:20] <jrockjiggz> or you can change the range based on the selection.. so imperial as default and if metric, divide the input by 25.4 and that is your imperial equivalent
[20:29:50] <jrockjiggz> or, metric as default, if imperial divide by .03937
[20:29:53] <sixohquad> you'll see i'm passing an object validOptions to the validation script, but it doesn't seem to change when i switch the radio buttons between metric and imperial
[20:32:01] <coldhead> you awesome nerd, jrockjiggz
[20:32:04] <coldhead> <3
[20:33:07] <sixohquad> how do i change the range based on whether metric or imperial are chosen, thats what im having issue with mainly
[20:35:00] <sixohquad> how to change the range based on radio buttons
[20:35:45] <sixohquad> lol this part feels so difficult and it shouldn't i dont think
[20:36:21] <jrockjiggz> can u not remove and add rules?
[20:36:40] <sixohquad> lol yes i can
[20:36:43] <sixohquad> im sure i can
[20:36:58] <sixohquad> i was thinking of declaring whole new options, but instead i should remove and re-add
[20:37:01] <sixohquad> right?
[20:37:46] <jrockjiggz> .rules('remove', {range})  .add('add',{range: '33'})
[20:39:28] <sixohquad> notice mine is rules: "width[]": range, how would i target that specifically?
[20:40:44] <jrockjiggz> $('#QuoteForm').rules('remove', {"width[]"}).rules('add',{"width[]" : {required: true, range: [204,915});
[20:40:54] <jrockjiggz> oops
[20:41:14] <jrockjiggz> $('#QuoteForm').rules('remove', {"width[]"}).rules('add',{"width[]" : {required: true, range: [204,915]}});
[20:41:36] <sixohquad> thanks for the curly ;)
[20:41:44] <sixohquad> i'm gonna try this now, your a genius
[20:42:07] <jrockjiggz> im not sure if quoting width is going to work
[20:42:08] <snover> {"width[]"} makes absolutely no sense.
[20:42:33] <sixohquad> i want to pass an array of width's to the php file
[20:42:39] <sixohquad> can i drop the []'s?
[20:43:03] <jrockjiggz> if its a name then its ok?
[20:43:43] <DyeA> question: is there a document ready event AND a dom ready event? Are these two separate events or are they equivalent
[20:44:37] <coldhead> they're equivalent
[20:44:56] <coldhead> at least in so far as the DOM /is/ the document
[20:45:07] <coldhead> for js's purposes
[20:45:09] <DyeA> arch! well is there no way to hide elements before they are rendered?
[20:45:21] <coldhead> css, baby
[20:45:30] <coldhead> or style="display:none" in the html
[20:45:52] <jrockjiggz> or generate the html in js and append
[20:45:52] <DyeA> ok, I mean visible for non js clients and hidden by js on load for clients with hs
[20:46:46] <DyeA> best practices: I want search engines and non js clients to be able to access the content but maybe I want a slick show/hide going on in js for the js clients
[20:46:47] <jrockjiggz> so .hide() inside .ready() isn't working?
[20:47:07] <DyeA> I am seeing a flash of content unload, then the js hides it
[20:47:22] <DyeA> this is using jquery's document rady
[20:48:15] <DyeA> I had thought we could access and manipulate the dom tree before the browser started painting
[20:48:53] <DyeA> scuse me: flash of content onload
[20:48:59] <jrockjiggz> DyeA: you can put your hide(); outside of document ready
[20:49:00] <DyeA> frickin Lion auto correct
[20:49:11] <jrockjiggz> http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/10/1-way-to-avoid-the-flash-of-unstyled-content
[20:49:32] <DyeA> jrockjiggz: thanks! I will check that out
[20:50:51] <jrockjiggz> DyeA: this is the same answer, bit with the exact question that you have   ---   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3131392/how-does-one-hide-content-from-a-user-until-a-stylesheet-is-loaded-and-executed
[20:51:30] <sixohquad> hey jrockjiggz im getting a javascript error on that
[20:51:32] <sixohquad> invalid object initializer			$('#QuoteForm').rules('remove', {"w... : {required: true, range: [8,36]}});
[20:52:37] <sixohquad> and the form is posting
[20:54:10] <DyeA> jrockjiggz:Righteous!  Thanks again!
[20:54:42] <lduros> hello, when I do $.get() and try to get a .txt file which only contains plain text (an excerpt of a story in one single line)
[20:54:59] <jrockjiggz> check your syntax
[20:55:01] <lduros> I can't seem to get to the text, the data variable returned by the callback is an XML object
[20:55:38] <lduros> but how do I get the actual text?
[20:55:40] <sixohquad> ok i got that part working, but it still won't update my validation ranges
[20:55:46] <sixohquad> it was syntax
[20:57:06] <jigz> sixohquad: prove your ranges have not changed
[20:58:50] <lduros> got it, i had to do $.ajax and set dataType as text ;-)
[20:59:17] <sixohquad> it remains between 8-36 no matter what
[20:59:31] <sixohquad> the error will not go away, the form will not validate until it meets that range, no matter what you do
[21:00:02] <sixohquad> :w
[21:00:18] <sixohquad> http://clients.codyhalovich.com/excel/www/?page_id=198
[21:00:26] <sixohquad> there it is in action
[21:01:47] <sixohquad> hrm, he's gone
[21:02:33] <sixohquad> ah nice
[21:02:37] <jrockjiggz> ;)
[21:03:00] <lduros> is there a more efficient way to add a letter to a string than my_text.text( my_text + my_character); ?
[21:03:04] <sixohquad> did you catch my message with the link to the form?
[21:03:31] <sixohquad> its erroring out and submitting the form without validating
[21:03:36] <jrockjiggz> yea is it bind to both metric or inch?
[21:03:52] <sixohquad> http://clients.codyhalovich.com/excel/www/?page_id=198
[21:04:38] <sixohquad> you can see the error, i dont see any syntax issues, maybe you do?
[21:05:04] <jrockjiggz> syntax error
[21:05:35] <jrockjiggz> ('remove', {"width[]"})   should be   ('remove', "width[]")
[21:06:17] <sixohquad> still doesn't change
[21:06:28] <sixohquad> different errors now tho ;)
[21:08:57] <jrockjiggz> ok try getting .rules('remove') working on something simple first
[21:13:53] <sontek> Any of you guys use mediaelement? I'm trying to figure out how to tell it what mimetype i'm sending it
[21:14:02] <sontek> It seems to not like files without an extension
[21:14:12] <sontek> but i'm using s3 to store it, so I get a weird URL
[21:15:09] <sixohquad> lol i cant get rules remove working
[21:15:31] <jrockjiggz> <source type="video/mp4"> ?
[21:15:35] <sixohquad> this is the very last piece to this form, its killing me
[21:16:23] <zilly> How do you create an element with after and have after return the created element?
[21:17:25] <jrockjiggz> sixohquad: ohhh rules() is related to elements
[21:18:18] <jrockjiggz> var html = "<b>";  .after(html); return html;
[21:19:19] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: ok, im not sure fully what that means, do i have to target differently?
[21:19:23] <jrockjiggz> sixohquad: nm i was wrong.. rules should work?
[21:19:52] <sixohquad> maybe my rules are setup incorrectly?
[21:20:05] <sixohquad> i dont think so tho, cuz they work lol
[21:20:25] <jrockjiggz> check if rules() is a function
[21:23:42] <sixohquad> how?
[21:23:49] <sixohquad> is_function()?
[21:28:56] <jrockjiggz> $.isFunction(rules);
[21:30:47] <sixohquad> var isit = $.isFunction(rules);         alert(isit);
[21:31:14] <sixohquad> i get "rules is not defined" in firebug
[21:31:50] <sixohquad> and no alert
[21:33:23] <Chri_____>  /nick k1t
[21:33:55] <jrockjiggz> what exact plugin you are using?
[21:34:18] <sixohquad> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[21:34:27] <sixohquad> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[21:35:51] <sixohquad> * jQuery Validation Plugin 1.8.1
[21:37:01] <jrockjiggz> include the adition methods http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.8.1/additional-methods.js
[21:37:42] <jrockjiggz> actually rules function should be part of core
[21:37:52] <sixohquad> thats what i was thinking
[21:39:06] <jrockjiggz> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules
[21:39:34] <sixohquad> yeah thats where i've been working from
[21:41:05] <jrockjiggz> you might need to $(#QuoteForm').validator.rules(...);
[21:46:31] <sixohquad> what about targeting the field itself rather than the form?
[21:46:36] <sixohquad> will that work?
[21:49:45] <jrockjiggz> are you adding the validate() before applying the rules
[21:50:00] <sixohquad> no
[21:50:24] <jrockjiggz> do so
[21:50:25] <sixohquad> its after the rules, and the change function
[21:50:27] <sixohquad> ok

[21:52:04] <bobdobbs> Anyone know if there is a tool that can take my javascripts, and squish them into a single file?
[21:52:17] <sixohquad> yeah linux
[21:52:22] <sixohquad> cat * > bigdamnfile.js
[21:52:23] <sixohquad> lol
[21:52:45] <bobdobbs> sixohquad: I'm a dumbass. I've been doing that, and messing it up somehow
[21:52:57] <bobdobbs> My concatenated file never works
[21:53:08] <sixohquad> dang
[21:53:18] <bobdobbs> I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Maybe catting them in the wrong order or something.
[21:53:28] <sixohquad> cat * >> bigdamnfile.js ? lol
[21:53:34] <sixohquad> just a guess
[21:53:58] <bobdobbs> I think that would just about garuntee a breakage
[21:54:12] <bobdobbs> 'cos, they would be catted in alphabetical order.
[21:54:21] <coldhead> bobdobbs: use the google closure compiler
[21:54:28] <coldhead> concat and compress
[21:54:35] <coldhead> and it does it safely
[21:54:37] <bobdobbs> coldhead: thanks. checking it out now...
[21:55:36] <bobdobbs> coldhead: wow. It comes with a firebug extension too
[21:55:45] <coldhead> yeah it's the future
[21:57:16] <bobdobbs> dammit. closure inspector not compatible with firefox 6.
[21:57:19] <bobdobbs> sadface
[21:59:29] <bobdobbs> gawd. also the ff plugin for pagespeed is hidden away.
[21:59:34] <testuser12345> In https://gist.github.com/1196611,  they are extending ':' to have containsignore case, I am not able to understand how the argument a,i,m are used and passed  I mean function(a,i,m)
[22:19:17] <sixohquad> bad news. i followed that code and got nothing
[22:19:24] <sixohquad> same kind of error
[22:22:12] <jrockjiggz> =/
[22:22:44] <jrockjiggz> quote: "I see the error in my code. It turns out that I wasn't adding the validate() before applying the rules. That makes all the difference :)"
[22:23:38] <jrockjiggz> the last example on that stackoverflow page is good, define the validation inside the submit event within an if statement
[22:38:42] <pouledodue> how can I find a checkbox by its name and value ?
[22:45:03] <sixohquad> http://pastebin.com/F0XmWBrj
[22:45:06] <sixohquad> i've updated the code
[22:45:10] <sixohquad> still not working
[22:45:43] <sixohquad> i made a couple comments to clear things up as well
[22:45:48] <jrockjiggz> pouledodue:   $('*:checkbox').find('[name="elementName"]')
[22:46:47] <jrockjiggz> $("input:checkbox[name='elName']");
[22:47:31] <pouledodue> jrockjiggz: thx
[22:47:54] <jrockjiggz> sixohquad: is it not working
[22:49:08] <sixohquad> no
[22:50:53] <jrockjiggz> i fixed ur syntax errors here http://jsfiddle.net/baEXj/
[22:51:52] <sixohquad> wow, jsfiddle is cool
[22:53:17] <jrockjiggz> and your :checked value may not work with radio options.. i will fix
[22:55:10] <sixohquad> but it works above that to change the units from in to mm and vice versa
[22:55:21] <sixohquad> the :checked value's i mean
[22:55:33] <sixohquad> and for some reason, still won't update my validation rules
[22:58:06] <sixohquad> this is going to drive me mental
[22:58:08] <sixohquad> i think
[22:59:45] <jrockjiggz> you were missing a ' in [name='measurement']
[23:00:14] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/baEXj/1/
[23:01:41] <sixohquad> ok, even in your code there is still only uses the metric rules
[23:01:44] <lng> hi! is it possible to execute ajax call w/o waiting the response?
[23:01:45] <sixohquad> will not use imperial rules
[23:01:45] <jrockjiggz> something is failing inside the validate() function
[23:02:14] <jrockjiggz> lng: ajax is by default async: true (meaning it doesn't wait)
[23:02:15] <timjs> question about jquery.load():
[23:02:25] <lng> jrockjiggz: true
[23:02:45] <timjs> I'm using .load() to replace the <body> of a page, and the new page includes script tags
[23:02:47] <lng> jrockjiggz: thanks
[23:02:53] <timjs> in most browsers, this is fine
[23:03:04] <timjs> but in FF 3 (at least), the scripts don't seem to run
[23:03:07] <timjs> any ideas?
[23:03:41] <timjs> works fine in latest Chrome and latest FF
[23:04:14] <jrockjiggz> timjs: weird
[23:05:40] <timjs> jrockjiggz: I'm thinking of making a minimal test case and submitting a bug report - unless anyone has a better next step?
[23:06:01] <timjs> (and assuming the minimal test case shows the same behaviour ;)
[23:06:23] <lng> how do I execute ajax call n times with certain interval?
[23:06:47] <lng> do I need queue()?
[23:08:01] <jrockjiggz> sixohquad: your "width[]" in your rules is breaking the plugin
[23:08:21] <jrockjiggz> ?g setTimeout with jquery
[23:08:22] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, javascript - JQuery, setTimeout not working - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1495903/jquery-settimeout-not-working
[23:08:40] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: if i remove the [] will it still pass an array to php from the form?
[23:09:06] <jrockjiggz> you probably should escape the [ ]    "width\[\]"
[23:12:05] <sixohquad> escape them in the javascript and the html or just the javascript?
[23:12:31] <jrockjiggz> not html
[23:12:34] <jrockjiggz> i'm still not sure
[23:12:43] <sixohquad> just making sure
[23:12:45] <sixohquad> its still broken
[23:13:14] <timjs> jrockjiggz: the FF 3 issue doesn't happen in the latest jQuery. I guess I
[23:13:19] <timjs> 'll upgrade :)
[23:16:57] <sixohquad> k i changed it all from width[] and depth[] to widthField and depthField
[23:16:59] <sixohquad> still broken
[23:18:23] <jrockjiggz> sixohquad: trying something else...
[23:19:12] <sixohquad> im surprised there's no easy solution to this yet
[23:21:53] <lng> why does hi wrap jquery code with $(function() {...}? http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=1948
[23:23:20] <Cork> ?.ready @ lng
[23:23:20] <bot-t> lng, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:23:24] <lng> normally I use $(document).ready(function() {
[23:23:45] <lng> is it the same?
[23:23:46] <Cork> lng: $() is a shorthand for among other .ready
[23:23:51] <lng> ah
[23:23:54] <lng> cheers
[23:23:55] <lng> :-)
[23:23:58] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: any other idea's?
[23:26:27] <Trisox> any one ever did form with conditions and branching?
[23:27:45] <jrockjiggz> k got it
[23:30:20] <sixohquad> got a link?
[23:30:46] <jrockjiggz> i fibbed the numbers u can fix it, http://jsfiddle.net/baEXj/3/
[23:30:50] <Cork> Trisox: with conditions?
[23:31:13] <Trisox> yea if answer is a take branche A else B
[23:31:34] <Trisox> depending on user question ask them te folowing question
[23:31:38] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: that seems to work great for figuring out imperial, but wont do metric
[23:31:50] <jrockjiggz> sry http://jsfiddle.net/baEXj/4/
[23:32:26] <Cork> Trisox: and by branch you mean different urls?
[23:32:38] <Cork> or different code paths in the submit handler?
[23:32:44] <Trisox> no different question path
[23:32:57] <Cork> question paths??
[23:33:50] <Trisox> yea
[23:34:01] <Trisox> like survey
[23:34:22] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: it doesn't do anything for me now
[23:34:26] <Trisox> if answer is A go to answer c not B
[23:34:30] <Cork> you leaving out way to mouch context
[23:34:31] <sixohquad> when it doesn't validate i dont get a message
[23:34:31] <Trisox> question c.
[23:34:39] <Trisox> something like this
[23:34:44] <Cork> where does the question come from?
[23:34:51] <Cork> how do you want to serv them to the user?
[23:35:14] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/ypnv5/17/
[23:35:16] <Cork> is it hidden parts in the page or is it loaded through ajax
[23:35:34] <Trisox> hidden
[23:36:20] <Cork> Trisox: id's can only exist once in the page
[23:36:33] <Cork> opps and it would be nice if i learn to read
[23:36:34] <Trisox> yea i know not using them now..
[23:36:44] <Trisox> :D
[23:36:58] <Cork> b and a looked the same with the font used >_>
[23:37:34] <Cork> Trisox: ok, looks like you have what you want so whats the question?
[23:37:35] <Trisox> srr
[23:37:53] <Trisox> no this is to simple its going to be waaay larger so..
[23:38:41] <Cork> Trisox: just put the sub elements inside the parent questions div
[23:38:47] <Trisox> mm
[23:38:49] <Cork> and use class instead of id
[23:38:56] <Trisox> ill think of it
[23:39:17] <Trisox> the way i got it now is not realy flexible when going back
[23:39:18] <Cork> Trisox: then you can use deligate on the base, and catch them all
[23:41:07] <Trisox> mm
[23:42:48] <sixohquad> jrockjiggz: i gotta go to bed man, thanks for your help, can you drop me a quick pm if this bugs you and you decide to solve it?
