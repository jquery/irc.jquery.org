[00:06:51] <mementomori> hi
[00:27:23] <Suppa_Spic> hello, I need help to get the value from a specific element http://jsfiddle.net/X2FEv/
[00:27:45] <Suppa_Spic> I get an empty value, but I am not sure if I am using the correct selector
[00:29:19] <Suppa_Spic> well nvm I got it
[00:47:59] <danbeam_> hello, I was wondering if there was the equivalent to goog.async.DeferredList.gatherResults() in jQuery.Deferred? or put another way, if there is simply a way to do something when a lot of asynchronous operations are done using jQuery.Deferred
[00:49:13] <danbeam_> i.e. /* start loading lots of scripts asynchronously in parallel */.done(function(){ alert('all done!'); })
[00:57:00] <danbeam_> nvm, found the example on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[01:00:25] <Krambiorix> hi guys
[01:00:37] <Krambiorix> when i execute following code, my page get refreshed.... http://pastebin.com/UHweCQ13
[01:14:16] <b2l> Krambiorix, I don't think the code you paste is the problem
[01:14:41] <b2l> you probably trigger this ajax call on click on some <a/> or button element
[01:15:01] <b2l> and don't prevent the browser default action
[01:16:38] <granden> Anyone here who have used highcharts? I mailed there technical support but thought I at least could give it a try here.
[01:17:53] <Krambiorix> b2l so, i have to call preventDefault before the ajax call?
[01:18:04] <b2l> yes
[01:26:06] <Krambiorix> b2l , but i don't have an event object to call it on
[01:26:08] <granden> I got problems with my pie-charts. The label/text show per pie piece is cut of at the end of the divs.
[01:27:16] <b2l> Krambiorix, can you create another pastebin or a jsfiddle with the code that wrap your ajax call
[01:27:48] <b2l> granden, don't know this project, maybe you can create a jsfiddle so we can try to help
[01:28:57] <Krambiorix> b2l, please: http://pastebin.com/UQziyM6c
[01:30:45] <granden> b2l: Sure, will do it in a minute. With a JS-fiddle could I use 3rd party jquery plugins?
[01:31:00] <b2l> granden, I'm not really sure
[01:31:07] <b2l> Krambiorix, you should have an event handler which call the convertToTask function
[01:34:43] <Rudeboy> I'm trying to replace the parent menu item link to a "#" using: $('a.menuparent').attr('href', '#');           It's not working though, could someone here help?
[01:35:44] <Krambiorix> b2l, it's like this http://pastebin.com/dpazyX0L
[01:36:54] <mdik> Rudeboy: put your code in a pastebin (like http://pastie.org) and post teh link
[01:39:41] <granden> b2l: http://jsfiddle.net/nHxkH/
[01:39:45] <b2l> Krambiorix, the problem is in you callback function. You recieve key and options as arguments. you should have and event so you can prevent it
[01:39:47] <granden> Tere is my pie-chart.
[01:39:49] <granden> There'
[01:40:08] <Rudeboy> mdik: Well it's just this one line that needs work, more specifically the selector. It works using $('.menuparent a').attr('href', '#');  but then the top menu items of the menus are assigned the "#" link too. I only want the PARENT links to have the "#" link assigned
[01:40:09] <granden> As you can see, BERGEN (DAHLS) is cut off.
[01:40:10] <b2l> Krambiorix, try to debug it with firebug or equivalent if you can, or just console.log arguments
[01:42:29] <Krambiorix> b2l, can't i just add event to the parameters
[01:42:32] <b2l> granden, http://jsfiddle.net/nHxkH/1/
[01:42:50] <granden> b2l: Yeah I can adjust the width.
[01:42:56] <granden> But thats not the way I want to do it.
[01:43:16] <granden> Rather someway get smaller pie-charts
[01:43:25] <granden> Becasue 400px is my maximum with
[01:43:27] <granden> width*
[01:43:27] <b2l> I guess you have to hack you pie chart to handle this case
[01:43:43] <b2l> granden, I was sure you were restricted
[01:44:03] <b2l> Krambiorix, you can try
[01:44:09] <mdik> Rudeboy: sorry, i don't get it. i would need more text to look at. but i'm no good a JS anyway...
[01:44:24] <Krambiorix> b2l , damn "event is undefined"
[01:45:19] <b2l> Krambiorix, console.log(arguments) so you can see what you got
[01:46:10] <b2l> granden, there's no option in highcharts for the label ?
[01:48:29] <granden> b2l: I'm trying to find something in the api right now.
[01:48:32] <granden> Cant do it though.
[01:48:42] <Krambiorix> b2l no event object
[01:50:37] <Rudeboy> mdik: Ok no worries, thanks though :)
[01:56:34] <Krambiorix> b2l, ok so i can't use preventDefault then
[02:05:17] <b2l> Krambiorix, strange, is you $.contextMenu a plugin you made, or a third party one .
[02:05:18] <b2l> ?
[02:07:30] <Krambiorix> b2l third party one  : http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/index.html
[02:10:36] <b2l> Krambiorix, is you look at this demo : http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html
[02:10:44] <void> hello. I have a stupid question: what is the best (on your opinion) lightbox plugin for today?
[02:11:09] <b2l> you see that there using an event handler to $('.context-menu-one').on('click', function(e){ ...
[02:11:25] <b2l> you have to do the same thing so you can do you e.preventDefault
[02:11:54] <Krambiorix> b2l , the click function is there for when the user clicks the area, not right clicks
[02:12:11] <granden> Is it possible using javascript or jquery to detect if the user came from a file called kommande.php or from bokaaktivitet.php both of the referers may have different GET variables
[02:12:20] <granden> but just want to know which the source file is.
[02:13:13] <b2l> Krambiorix, in your case, it should be something like : $(".context-menu-item").on("click", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[02:13:21] <b2l> Krambiorix, it should do the trick
[02:18:04] <Krambiorix> b2l, context-menu-item is the area . But the user doesn't click it, it right clicks the area.
[02:18:28] <b2l> Krambiorix, it's the right click that redirect you ?
[02:18:41] <b2l> I was thinking it was when you click on some context menu link
[02:19:31] <Krambiorix> b2l nope
[02:19:55] <b2l> so it refresh when you click on the .message tag
[02:20:01] <b2l> even right click
[02:20:56] <Krambiorix> b2l nope
[02:21:15] <b2l> Krambiorix, explain when the refresh occurs then
[02:21:59] <Krambiorix> b2l i right click on the .message area , then a menu appears and when i click a menu option, then the refresh occurs
[02:26:36] <b2l> Krambiorix, I try this on the demo page, and it work  $('.context-menu-item').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[02:26:52] <b2l> sorry, I put an alert in the eventHandler, and the alert popup
[02:44:36] <gfdg> sdfsf
[02:47:20] <Imaginativeone> how do I switch to an alternate index.html file?
[02:50:37] <teleyinex> Hi there
[02:50:47] <Bonson> Hello
[02:50:50] <teleyinex> I'm building a progress bar using Deferred.notify and progress
[02:50:57] <teleyinex> and for the Bar twitter Bootstrap :-)
[02:51:10] <teleyinex> there are 3 async deferred
[02:51:19] <teleyinex> that will return notify the progressBar
[02:51:31] <teleyinex> everything works, but there is a minor issue :-)
[02:51:44] <teleyinex> the bar increases and decreases its size
[02:51:54] <teleyinex> 2 of the async calls are canonical
[02:52:03] <teleyinex> however the 3rd one will be called 20 times
[02:52:09] <teleyinex> thus, I've totalSteps = 22
[02:52:19] <teleyinex> and I compute the pctComplete based on that
[02:52:48] <teleyinex> basically each deferred notifies this: deferred.notify(steps++)
[02:53:02] <teleyinex> why I'm seeing the bar decreasing?
[02:53:15] <teleyinex> in the console log all the values are correct
[02:53:24] <teleyinex> according to the pctComplete and the steps value
[02:53:53] <teleyinex> could it be because an old deferred is resolving to a previous value?
[02:56:53] <teleyinex> never mind
[02:56:57] <teleyinex> I did a quick fix
[02:57:07] <teleyinex> only update the bar if the value is greater than in the previous step
[02:57:08] <teleyinex> :D
[03:01:09] <Krambiorix> b2l it's not like that
[03:03:01] <[ric]> guys, was looking at using the data-* attribute to store stuff. I was reading this... http://blog.mitemitreski.com/2012/06/html-5-data-attributes-how-to-use-it.html
[03:03:09] <[ric]> and I have several questions about it
[03:03:51] <[ric]> first off is it better to use the .attr("attrname") or .data("name") methods?
[03:04:08] <[ric]> in the comments sections it gives a good argument for using attr over data
[03:05:06] <Aprendiz1234> hi all
[03:06:11] <[ric]> secondly in that article it states if I use the .data("name") I can pick up JSON data as part of the return, my attribute is data-size="{'width':0, 'height':0}" when I query myjQel.data("size") it returns only the string, not the json data.. ie: doing myjqQel.data("size").width returns "undefined"
[03:06:16] <Aprendiz1234> i have several divs with the same class and a select inside. I am working with .each to access each div but I don't know how to access to the value of the select
[03:06:38] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234 .val() is the method for returning the value set
[03:07:33] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: gives me undefined => console.log($(this).filter("#leave_day_chosen_options").val());
[03:07:33] <Aprendiz1234> leave_day_chosen_options is the class of the select
[03:07:51] <[ric]> # is for id
[03:07:53] <[ric]> . is for class
[03:08:01] <[ric]> .leave_day_chosen_options
[03:08:02] <Aprendiz1234> ups, sorry :(
[03:08:04] <[ric]> np
[03:08:52] <[ric]> technically if there is only one select in your div, you could as easily done ... filter("select").val()
[03:10:41] <[ric]> If anyone is reading my question, the thing relates to the a animated hide show layer so I am planning in storing the original rendered size in the data-size attribute
[03:10:45] <Aprendiz1234> undefined, I don't know why
[03:11:05] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234: try a simple test case then post it to jsfiddle or somewhere
[03:12:09] <fotoflo> hmm, is there any problem with this jqueryui code?       $('#contentFrame').show( "slide", { direction: "up" }, "slow" );
[03:12:17] <[ric]> in regards to the JSON on my query I could as easily run it through a JSON parser, just that the blog seems to imply it is already returned as JSON object
[03:14:00] <[ric]> fotoflo does it work without the easing?
[03:14:53] <Aprendiz1234> ric console.log($(this)) gives me the right element but console.log($(this).filter("select")); is null
[03:14:59] <fotoflo> [ric]: you mean without the direction?
[03:15:33] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234: without seeing code I can't comment
[03:15:52] <fotoflo> [ric]: its the same with and without, it hides and shows (the hide code is pretty much the same), but it just disappears, it doesn't have any animation
[03:15:59] <[ric]> fotoflo: .show( duration [, callback] )
[03:16:59] <fotoflo> rick: oh it seems to work better just that way
[03:17:04] <fotoflo> sorry [ric]
[03:17:09] <[ric]> np
[03:17:20] <fotoflo> [ric]: but its not the effect I want
[03:17:52] <[ric]> fair enough, just you need to check if the problem is with the UI or the jQ
[03:18:22] <Aprendiz1234> ric => http://pastebin.com/FZTEa7jH
[03:18:41] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: http://pastebin.com/FZTEa7jH
[03:19:01] <fotoflo> [ric]:      $('#contentFrame').hide( "slow" ); hides with an animation that doesn't appear broken
[03:20:19] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234 if you debug, then query what $(this) is, what does it return is it what you expect?
[03:20:49] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: yes, $(this) is the right div
[03:20:50] <[ric]> fotoflo: is this happening in isolation, or do you need to .stop() before running your animation
[03:21:08] <fotoflo> [ric]: i think i found the problem
[03:21:24] <fotoflo> i am running a reduced version of jqueryui
[03:21:33] <fotoflo> not the whole package
[03:21:36] <[ric]> no effects I presume, fotoflo
[03:21:43] <fotoflo> right
[03:21:56] <[ric]> yeah, hence the reason to check with and without the UI easing call
[03:21:57] <fotoflo> which effects do i need?
[03:22:09] <fotoflo> slide? or just core?
[03:22:12] <[ric]> not sure to be honest mate, just grab the fucking lot.. :P
[03:22:42] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234 have you checked the actual HTML output you are building
[03:24:03] <[ric]> as I can see the code, but in cases like this it's best to take the html off to a separate page and run a few jQ queries at it
[03:24:03] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: yes and when I debug $(this) gives me the right div and all the inside elements but I can't access to them(an input and a select)
[03:25:12] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234: and that is definitely being added to the page as you would expect
[03:25:24] <[ric]> it's difficult to see just via the code and not the HTML
[03:25:34] <fotoflo> upgrading
[03:27:17] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234: so if you were to do ... $(this).html() you would get <div> .. <select> .. <option>
[03:27:27] <fotoflo> hmm
[03:27:27] <[ric]> oh, and you have a typo... Solicitar is Solicitor.. :)
[03:27:39] <fotoflo> [ric]: so down is working, but up isn't now
[03:28:27] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: yes
[03:28:32] <fotoflo>       $('#contentFrame').hide( "slide", { direction: "down" }, "slow" );   to hide
[03:28:38] <fotoflo>       $('#contentFrame').show( "slide", { direction: "up" }, "slow" );
[03:28:41] <fotoflo> to show
[03:32:16] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234, I realise I said you could use filter("select") but you were previously using a className
[03:32:26] <[ric]> returning it to the className does it work then
[03:32:41] <[ric]> maybe I am being retarded here, "select" should work but maybe not
[03:32:57] <[ric]> fotoflo so "down" works but "up" doesn't?
[03:33:17] <[ric]> sounds more like the logic going wrong somewhere rather than the actual effect
[03:37:08] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: the same, this breaks when I use filter ..
[03:37:42] <fotoflo> [ric]: right… fixed
[03:37:45] <[ric]> perhaps use find then Aprendiz1234?
[03:38:13] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: yes, that works
[03:38:16] <[ric]> fotoflo: the animation stuff can be a bit tricky, and when things go wrong it's always the first thing you point your finger at
[03:38:42] <[ric]> Aprendiz1234: :)
[03:38:49] <Aprendiz1234> [ric]: thanks
[03:38:52] <[ric]> np
[03:38:57] <Tomashe> hey guys
[03:39:01] <Tomashe> if (image.next(".BLIM")) {
[03:39:19] <Tomashe> im trying to do if statement that if this element exist then...
[03:39:21] <[ric]> now if anyone else is alive I'd be interested to know their opinion of using .data("name") over attr("data-name")
[03:39:29] <Tomashe> but this not working when its not exists
[03:39:34] <[ric]> .length Tomashe
[03:39:39] <Tomashe> ohh yes
[03:39:41] <Tomashe> idiot me
[03:39:44] <Tomashe> i forgot about that
[03:39:55] <[ric]> np, imo jQ needs a .ifExists()
[03:40:03] <[ric]> as .length seems a little hacky (imo)
[03:40:56] <lund> hello, i have a wrapper width 1000px, i want to calculate the rest of the window width, i know .width() can do it, but i don't know how to pass that function, for example, window width - 1000 / 2
[03:42:06] <[ric]> are you trying to position layer underneath something, separating the content from a popup for example?
[03:42:08] <fotoflo> ric… one more thing
[03:42:09] <fotoflo>       $('#contentFrame').hide( "slide", { direction: "down" }, 400 );
[03:42:10] <fotoflo>       $('#top-panel').animate( {top: topPanelTop }, 400 );
[03:42:17] <[ric]> fotoflo: wtf are you columbo? ;)
[03:42:39] <fotoflo> haha im a jquery detective
[03:42:49] <fotoflo> i have these two things happening in parallel… and there appears to be a little lag between them
[03:43:47] <[ric]> hmm, animation and javascript are never the best bedfellows. technically they should run asynch to each other but with a tiny delay as the first statement needs to be interpreted
[03:44:32] <[ric]> if there is a bigger delay then it's down to the jQ taking time to build it's animation timeouts
[03:44:36] <[ric]> it's all I can think of tbh
[03:44:48] <[ric]> you could perhaps put a delay on both starting
[03:44:57] <[ric]> but then you have the delay at the start of both
[03:45:14] <[ric]> it should give the jQ enough time to build the animation
[03:45:24] <[ric]> at least that's what I would guess is the issue
[03:45:50] <[ric]> lund: as I say, are you building a "cover" that needs to be stretched across the whole screen?
[03:46:17] <Schrostfutz> hi, im trying to insert an element before an specific child element, but the child element isnt on a fix position (first or second), how can i do that?
[03:48:08] <[ric]> schoppenhauer doesn't before() fit what you need?
[03:48:19] <[ric]> oops, Schrostfutz
[03:49:02] <Schrostfutz> there are many elements in the website, which have the childs class and it has no id. i only want to insert at that specific elements position
[03:49:43] <[ric]> you need to find some way to uniquely identify it
[03:50:00] <[ric]> without seeing any code I can't comment on that
[03:52:05] <[ric]> luchtime people.. have a good one..
[03:52:30] <lund> ric: yes but certain position from right
[04:12:47] <trinadh> lund: (window.width() - 1000)  ..?
[04:14:28] <trinadh> Schrostfutz: there must be something with which you identify which element it is...
[04:29:31] <azbyin> hi all..
[04:30:02] <azbyin> How do I make an element fade in when it is just about to be added to the doc tree?
[04:30:46] <azbyin> I tried li.hide().appendTo(ul).fadeIn(800);  this makes the li fadein, but it also adds a new style="display:block;"  attr
[04:31:08] <azbyin> which messes up the rendering as my css does special things to display:blocks
[04:37:41] <azbyin> li.hide().appendTo(ul).fadeIn(800).css({"display":""});  seems to work. but what a rubbish workaround!
[04:48:56] <fotoflo> how do i check if a JQuery ui slider is initiated
[04:49:00] <fotoflo> ?
[04:49:04] <granden> Hmm, ok guys, I got a bit of a problem. I got a mobile web page. With a form with multiple fields. And wonder if it is possible to disable the submit of the form using the Go/Enter button on an Android/iPhone?
[05:05:18] <granden> $(document).keydown(function (e){ if(e.keyCode == 13){ //What to do here  }});
[05:05:31] <granden> I thought something like that could work. But dont know how to disable that button.
[05:10:45] <granden> Want to disable all enter key presses.
[05:20:51] <Schrostfutz> can someone tell me how i can pause the execution of a javascript until a callback is finished?
[05:21:12] <chilversc_> Schrostfutz: why would you want to?
[05:24:55] <Schrostfutz> im receiving the locale of a website via a request and i want to wait until i have the locale before i use it
[05:26:23] <Bravo_> Hiho. Can i use else if in jQuery like this : http://pastebin.com/jUC5KGe3 ? :)
[05:27:26] <Saaether> sure, why not?
[05:28:02] <Bravo_> Ok =) i just wondered if there isnt any other function for that.
[05:35:57] <Schrostfutz> is there a way to access the sourcecode of a javascript which is defined in the head of a website?
[05:37:28] <Saaether> most browsers will allow you to do so
[05:42:22] <Schrostfutz> Saaether, i meant from within an extension
[05:58:37] <fabioportieri> how to use named functions inside plugin's anonymous function? it seems reference to paramers isn't passed through
[06:01:55] <fabioportieri> here the testcase http://pastie.org/5588736
[06:05:06] <fabioportieri> anyone?
[06:09:43] <Schrostfutz> where did you define x?
[06:10:27] <fabioportieri> outside
[06:10:54] <fabioportieri> my issue is how do i convert anonymous to named function with parameters
[06:11:25] <fabioportieri> doesn't seem to work:   change: function(event, ui) {   spinnerLogic(event, ui);
[06:14:37] <ajpiano> that works fine, there's nothing to "convert"
[06:14:47] <fabioportieri> right that worked
[06:14:50] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: i think the problem is that you are expecting "change" to fire at a different time than wen it does
[06:14:51] <fabioportieri> nevermind
[06:15:05] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: strictly speaking though it's completely unecessary
[06:15:11] <ajpiano> you can just do change: spinnerLogic,
[06:15:12] <fabioportieri> i saw x nan and ui.value undefined so i worried
[06:15:47] <fabioportieri> right, thanks ajpiano
[06:15:52] <fabioportieri> i remember you btw
[06:15:58] <jammanbo> So, I can use stopImmediatePropagation to have one event handler stop other event handlers. But after I've done that, is there some way to start them again? (Context is I'm trying to implement a modal confirmation dialog to optionally cancel the handlers bound to an event)
[06:16:01] <fabioportieri> where is temp01
[06:17:27] <ajpiano> he disappeared into the ether
[06:18:18] <fabioportieri> aw too bad
[06:21:02] <jammanbo> Or is there some other way one event handler could pause other handlers for the same event, and later resume them?
[06:24:30] <Schrostfutz> if i want to check wether a value is used as a key in an object and i check for it with this: if(!object[key]) what happens if the key is undefined?
[06:24:55] <ajpiano> it will still work
[06:25:08] <ajpiano> however if the the key is actually boolean false or any falsy value, you'll be screwed
[06:25:18] <ajpiano> Schrostfutz: you should use if (key in obj)
[06:25:37] <Schrostfutz> ah! didnt know that existed. thanks
[06:25:55] <Schrostfutz> undefined will never be in any object, will it?
[06:26:10] <ajpiano> of course
[06:26:12] <ajpiano> that's the whole point
[06:27:09] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {bar: undefined}; "bar" in foo;
[06:27:11] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[06:27:17] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {bar: undefined}; foo[bar]
[06:27:18] <bot-t> ajpiano: ReferenceError: bar is not defined
[06:27:20] <ajpiano> whoops
[06:27:24] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {bar: undefined}; foo["bar"]
[06:27:25] <bot-t> ajpiano: undefined
[06:31:08] <Schrostfutz> crazy! there is a javascript bot in here!
[06:32:57] <Schrostfutz> ?eval var foo = {bar: undefined}; if(undefined in foo) echo 'yes'; else echo 'no'
[06:32:58] <bot-t> Schrostfutz: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[06:33:06] <Schrostfutz> ?eval var foo = {bar: undefined}; if(undefined in foo) echo 'yes'; else echo 'no';
[06:33:06] <bot-t> Schrostfutz: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[06:33:19] <Schrostfutz> =/
[06:33:54] <ajpiano> there's no "echo" in javascript
[06:34:07] <ajpiano> Schrostfutz: in checks for keys, not values
[06:34:22] <ajpiano> you're not going to have a key named undefined
[06:34:34] <fabioportieri> still don't understand why x and ui.value are undefined :|
[06:35:00] <Schrostfutz> ah okay
[06:35:13] <Schrostfutz> but the if(foo in bar) syntax is correct?
[06:36:06] <ajpiano> if ("bar" in foo)
[06:36:20] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: the ui hash is empty for the spinner change event
[06:36:53] <fabioportieri> ajpiano: but now i'm calling it from the stop event, that is always triggered
[06:38:04] <ajpiano> it's also empty there, you just read the input's value
[06:38:05] <ajpiano> http://jsbin.com/efamad/1/
[06:38:29] <fabioportieri> ok then.. why x (global) is set to NaN?
[06:38:41] <ajpiano> how are we supposed to know
[06:39:41] <fabioportieri> after refactoring from anonymous function to named one
[06:39:55] <rindolf> Hi all. Do you think http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/_data/nav.json 39,184 bytes is excessive for that? Should I try to shorten/filter the keys?
[06:40:56] <Clex> rindolf: excessive for what?
[06:41:03] <ajpiano> that
[06:41:16] <rindolf> Clex: for a common JSON file retrieved using AJAX.
[06:41:28] <rindolf> Clex: hopefully, the browser will download it only once.
[06:41:35] <rindolf> Clex: and it might be served compressed.
[06:41:41] <Clex> Well, it's pretty light compared to let's say an image.
[06:43:24] <rindolf> Clex: OK.
[06:43:45] <rindolf> JSON has a little overhead with the various "’s
[06:44:24] <pmercado> Hi, how to traverse the " $inputs jquery object " from here https://github.com/nervetattoo/jquery-autosave#conditions  ?
[06:44:55] <pmercado> still can't understand how to deal with it
[06:46:43] <pmercado> console.debug($inputs) throw this: Object[input#idpac 889, input#nombre1 1er Nombre2, input#nombre2 2do Nombre2, input#apellido1 1er Apellido2, input#apellido2 2do Apellido2, input#sexo M, input#nacimiento 1922-02-02, input#edad 90, input#edad_meses 10, ........
[06:47:21] <pmercado> $inputs.find('#idpac') find an empty object
[06:47:41] <ajpiano> pmercado: $inputs.filter("#idpac")
[06:47:58] <ajpiano> find is for looking at the descendants of the set, filter is for filtering the existing set
[06:48:38] <pmercado> let me see.....
[06:50:12] <pmercado> ajpiano: what is a "jquery object that represents a set of DOM elements"?
[06:50:22] <pmercado> is an array of object ?
[06:50:26] <ajpiano> it's a jQuery object
[06:50:35] <ajpiano> it's an array-like structure
[06:50:46] <fabioportieri> http://pastie.org/5588904
[06:50:50] <ajpiano> it's an array of DOM elements "wrapped" with jQuery functionality for working with those elements
[06:51:27] <mikef> how would i give a newly genrated element a particular class name?   var $output = $("<p/>", { type:  options.type, id  :  options.id,  // class : options.class } ;   that last part how  do i achieve that.
[06:51:44] <ajpiano> mikef: "class" in quotes
[06:51:58] <mikef> ajpiano: thanks
[06:52:36] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: a static paste really doesn't help anyone help you, make a live demo of it failing
[06:54:22] <pmercado> " it's an array of DOM elements "wrapped" with jQuery functionality for working with those elements"  the whole array wrapped with jQuery functionality? or each array elements with jQuery functionality?
[06:55:09] <ajpiano> the whole array, but you can use methods to refine it (like filter)
[06:55:19] <pmercado> aah, ok
[06:55:21] <ajpiano> pmercado: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/jquery-object/ might help
[06:55:40] <pmercado> ajpiano: bookmarked!
[06:56:05] <pmercado> and filter doesn't return input
[06:56:07] <pmercado> :(
[06:56:25] <pmercado> i mean... return an empty object
[06:56:42] <ajpiano> is there actually an element with the id "idpac"
[06:57:23] <pmercado> yes and is hidden
[06:58:11] <pmercado> aaahhh refreshing page now return correctly
[06:58:13] <pmercado> uhm....
[07:03:54] <pmercado> ajpiano: seems work, thank you )=)
[07:06:38] <jammanbo> Is it possible to "reraise" an event? I'd hoped $(e.target).trigger(e) would work, but doesn't seem to...
[07:08:45] <gvo> Does anyone know how to correct this error?  Error loading /usr/local/freeswitch/mod/ftmod_wanpipe.so [/usr/local/freeswitch/mod/ftmod_wanpipe.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory]
[07:08:59] <gvo> Oops sorry wrong group.
[07:11:52] <Saaether> jammanbo your example worked for me
[07:12:15] <jammanbo> oO
[07:12:15] <jeffsmykil> So I have a development machine and I am making requests to a service on another machine.  If I use the volumes/ path to the project the cross domain problem does not arise, but if I use the IP or localhost it does, I am using jsonp and crossDomain: true
[07:12:24] <pmercado> ajpiano: yes now it works, thank you very much!
[07:13:05] <Saaether> jammanbo  http://jsfiddle.net/QfyxS/
[07:13:43] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you ready for the Michael Vick era for your beloved Jets?
[07:13:47] <jammanbo> Saaether: hrmmm… must be something else afoot in my code so.
[07:13:57] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: oh come on
[07:13:58] <ajpiano> anything but that
[07:14:11] <jeffsmykil> Sanchez again?
[07:14:19] <jeffsmykil> maybe you could pick up cassell or lienart
[07:14:28] <ajpiano> i'm hoping we get alex smtih
[07:14:30] <ajpiano> or draft....
[07:14:48] <jeffsmykil> no one really in the draft, and smith struggles without consistancy, he has shown that
[07:14:56] <jeffsmykil> you have too many holes, time to blow it all up
[07:15:12] <jeffsmykil> and your cap situation sucks
[07:15:16] <ajpiano> confirm
[07:15:22] <ajpiano> but we still need a quarterback after that
[07:15:30] <jeffsmykil> and the mets traded dickey
[07:15:32] <ajpiano> lol we should get matt barkley
[07:15:36] <jeffsmykil> not a ood time to be a nets jets mets fan
[07:15:37] <ajpiano> try the NEXT usc quarterback
[07:15:46] <jeffsmykil> but when is it?
[07:15:57] <ajpiano> heh
[07:16:01] <velcrobots> i have some jquery functions that manipulate things like classes and/or hrefs.  they work.  for the most part.  the thing is the functions that are coded to work on those altered values aren't.  i originally wrap everything in (document).ready but i guess once the DOM changes, all bets are off?
[07:16:13] <DukeDrake> hi
[07:16:22] <jeffsmykil> jump ship
[07:16:38] <jeffsmykil> come to the less often maligned giants side, I will welcome you with open arms
[07:16:53] <ajpiano> haha
[07:16:58] <jeffsmykil> come to the dark side
[07:17:04] <jeffsmykil> we have superbowl trophies
[07:17:32] <ajpiano> i know, shiny new ones too
[07:17:35] <DukeDrake> velcrobots: check .live('click', function() {});  ... although I heared, you should'nt use .live()
[07:18:09] <jeffsmykil> and no ryan borthers
[07:18:24] <jeffsmykil> live is depreciated DukeDrake you should use .on
[07:20:08] <velcrobots> .on?  ok, i'
[07:20:12] <velcrobots> i'll look it up
[07:20:21] <fabioportieri> i manually put value="403" inside an input field, but when i retrieve it via jquery it shows me NaN ?? it worked fine till 10 minutes ago :(
[07:20:38] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: it isn't a number
[07:20:39] <ajpiano> it's a string
[07:20:52] <ajpiano> when you get a value from an input box, it's a string, even if it is numeric
[07:20:58] <fabioportieri> i didn't ask for a number, but for val()
[07:21:05] <ajpiano> if you actually want a number you have to parseInt or whatnot
[07:21:11] <ajpiano> val gives you a string, you can't do math with it
[07:21:11] <jeffsmykil> parseInt(value, 10) fabioportieri
[07:21:17] <fabioportieri> i can't parseint nan!
[07:21:47] <sacrilicious> good morning
[07:21:48] <fabioportieri> $("#myinput").val() -> "NaN"
[07:21:50] <jeffsmykil> you can if you get the value and parseint the value before you do something with it thinking its an int
[07:22:02] <jeffsmykil> fabioportieri: jsfiddle?
[07:22:04] <ajpiano> fabioportieri: you are gonna have to come up with a test case that proves that
[07:22:38] <sacrilicious> i have a file input box, how do i recover the filename of the file being uploaded ? currently the value is "C:\fakepath\bp3.jpg", how do i get just the bp3.jpg part ?
[07:23:17] <jeffsmykil> string.split("\") and then refer to it as string[2]
[07:24:28] <sacrilicious> wow
[07:24:30] <sacrilicious> thanks
[07:24:31] <fabioportieri> maybe it's a cache issue
[07:25:12] <jeffsmykil> clear your cache
[07:25:20] <fabioportieri> indeed now it's ok
[07:25:26] <fabioportieri> pheww
[07:25:38] <jeffsmykil> if shit breaks clear your cache
[07:25:43] <fabioportieri> i can't handle too many bugs
[07:25:43] <jeffsmykil> ive beaten that into QA
[07:26:45] <sacrilicious> fabioportieri: you heard about triage ?
[07:26:58] <sacrilicious> patch most high level bugs first
[07:27:02] <fabioportieri> nop what is it
[07:27:26] <sacrilicious> then continue on with the medium and finally low level bugs
[07:27:34] <fabioportieri> what is high level bug?
[07:27:56] <sacrilicious> high level = anything that makes the website unusable -> breaks with huge ass server error
[07:28:01] <velcrobots> member:jeffsmykil: so that function with "on" goes outside of the document ready functions, correct?
[07:28:13] <DukeDrake> I'd like to learn about the animation capabilities of jquery .... or canvas ... anyone got me a website?
[07:28:30] <jeffsmykil> lol velcrobots I'm kind of a hypocrite, I have used .on once
[07:28:39] <jeffsmykil> you can bind to something elese
[07:28:48] <DukeDrake> e.g. for start I'd like to have  a circle transform to a line and back
[07:28:57] <fabioportieri> sacrilicious: lol i have tons of those
[07:29:19] <jeffsmykil> DukeDrake: first figure out the target browser, then figure out tech
[07:29:33] <velcrobots> lol no worries.  here's my code.  i'm getting a "not a function" error on the very last piece http://pastebin.com/psWzhqyM
[07:30:02] <DukeDrake> jeffsmykil: well ... it should work across browsers, of course =)
[07:30:10] <jeffsmykil> well which browsers DukeDrake
[07:30:19] <jeffsmykil> velcrobots: you can use $ instead of jquery
[07:30:45] <velcrobots> i'm doing this in Drupal and alway shave issues with the $, even with no conflict stuff, just seems to be safer
[07:30:46] <jeffsmykil> velcrobots: try that inside of the document ready and see what happens
[07:30:57] <jeffsmykil> fair enough
[07:30:58] <velcrobots> ok
[07:32:03] <velcrobots> jeffsmykil: no, still getting error.  is the syntax correct?
[07:32:42] <jeffsmykil> like i said velcrobots i have used it once, so am not sure on the intricacies, I am being summoned to the conference room for a meeting I have to run
[07:32:49] <velcrobots> k
[07:32:51] <DukeDrake> jeffsmykil: well, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE
[07:32:53] <shoky> velcrobots what jquery are you using
[07:33:03] <velcrobots> um, lemme see.
[07:33:08] <shoky> .on is from 1.7
[07:33:08] <b-ot> shoky, memorised “on”.
[07:33:15] <jeffsmykil> DukeDrake: what versions of IE canvas is tricky in some browsers depnding on what you want to do
[07:33:29] <velcrobots> ah so maybe drupal is running an older version
[07:33:36] <DukeDrake> 9 and up should be alright I guess
[07:33:52] <shoky> velcrobots if you're using smth older then just use  .click(function...   or  .bind('click', function..
[07:34:43] <velcrobots> sholy: 1.4.4
[07:34:47] <velcrobots> *shoky
[07:34:57] <shoky> velcrobots : and it SHOULD go inside document ready..
[07:35:30] <jeffsmykil> DukeDrake: I use kinetic.js for my canvas needs, I like it
[07:35:41] <jeffsmykil> but there is raphael too
[07:35:43] <jeffsmykil> which is svg
[07:36:56] <jeffsmykil> DukeDrake: you should probably read up on SVG versus Canvas and decide your course of action from there
[07:38:11] <velcrobots> shoky: it's weird though, that works, but then once i run code that changes the dom, that shouldn't apply anymore, and it does.
[07:38:55] <DukeDrake> jeffsmykil: cool =)
[07:39:00] <shoky> velcrobots: why shouldn't it apply anymore?  .bind('click'  or .click(  or .on('click', function...   bind the event to the element(s) you selected
[07:39:02] <DukeDrake> thanx for the hints =)
[07:39:14] <shoky> velcrobots: it doesnt matter if their ids/classes/whatever changes. the event is already bound to that element
[07:39:27] <velcrobots> shoky: oh.  sh*t
[07:39:33] <shoky> velcrobots: you might be looking for event delegation
[07:39:42] <shoky> ?delegate @ velcrobots
[07:39:42] <bot-t> velcrobots, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:40:08] <BillCriswell> Should that be updated to .on?
[07:40:22] <velcrobots> yeah i basically have a left and right arrow - and i am changing the class of the container they're in.  and depending on that container class, i want those same arrows to do different things.
[07:40:50] <rabbi1> how can i show a element with a variable cloned --> cloned.('.closeClone').show();  ??  previous code before this line cloned = $('.contacts').first().clone(); cloned.appendTo($(this).parent());
[07:41:55] <BillCriswell> rabbi1: Not sure I'm following you.
[07:42:15] <rabbi1> BillCriswell: just a sec
[07:43:46] <rabbi1> BillCriswell: I am trying to clone a fieldset having class name '.contacts' .... I also trying to show the hidden element called '.closeClone' to the cloned fieldset.....
[07:45:43] <BillCriswell> var $clone = $('.contacts').clone(); $clone.appendTo($('.container')); $clone.find('.closeClone').show();
[07:48:30] <sheilablackrose> can someone please take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/wA8NT/1/. the success function is being called before the ajax post is completed
[07:53:16] <rabbi1> BillCriswell: works great, thanks... the difference is $clone and just clone...... is it about the object ?
[07:54:07] <BillCriswell> rabbi1: Not sure I'm following you. I just use $foo so I know it's a jQuery object.
[07:54:19] <BrutusUnix> http://pastebin.com/DpYApMLD    click td get value of other td in same row
[07:58:57] <sheilablackrose> can someone please take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/wA8NT/1/. the success function is being called before the ajax post is completed. ive tried complete: as well but it didnt work
[08:01:57] <fabioportieri> ok solved the bug invasion
[08:02:05] <fabioportieri> i need some massive refactoring
[08:04:29] <aJacom> Does anyone know a good plugin for profile image upload / crop / resize / etc.
[08:04:32] <aJacom> ?
[08:06:04] <fabioportieri> i'm doing it :p
[08:06:31] <fabioportieri> aJacom: you might want to check jcrop out
[08:14:02] <velcrobots> shoky: delegate does exactly what i need.  and i learned a bit more on Jquery.  very much appreciated.  happy new year
[08:14:53] <shoky> velcrobots: glad to hear. happy happy merry merry
[08:17:46] <hiall> is it possible to use jquery/javascript to set a input field as invalid/valid so css can pick it up through the :valid :invalid pesuedos
[08:34:01] <fabioportieri> aJacom: are you dead?
[08:35:02] <GoGoGarrett> Is there anyway to serialize file inputs?
[08:35:29] <BillCriswell> hiall: Hmmm.... I'm looking through the properties and I see a validity object. What happens if you log .prop('validity')
[08:37:07] <hiall> will check BillCriswell second
[08:37:13] <BillCriswell> hiall: input.validity.valid = false does not appear to work.
[08:38:44] <hiall> it does come back as false though
[08:39:18] <BillCriswell> It doesn't seem to effect the style on the element or anything.
[08:39:56] <hiall> no :/
[08:40:02] <hiall> hmmn maybe its not possible
[08:40:36] <hiall> bizarre its not hough
[08:40:38] <hiall> though*
[08:41:07] <BillCriswell> hiall: It seems like it can get messy quickly.
[08:41:29] <BillCriswell> This is one of those times where I feel like it's a bad idea but I can't think of a reason haha.
[08:41:43] <hiall> hahaha ;)
[08:42:04] <hiall> yea ill just do it via add classes etc and doing a check. Just odd that its not made simple
[08:52:21] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: that tweet was about me :(
[08:53:58] <ajpiano> accurate

[08:57:17] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: careful Im like a little kid, I might just keep misbehaving so you tweet about me more
[08:57:33] <ajpiano> haha yeah i love the aot

[08:57:43] <ajpiano> alot of fire

[09:19:30] <Whirl3d> it'd porbably cost a lot of money.
[09:32:54] <pmercado> Hi, i'm using an autosave plugin https://github.com/nervetattoo/jquery-autosave
[09:33:48] <therealklanni> With $.Callbacks is there a way to set the scope of the callback? I want to set the scope, similar to Function#bind. Using Function#bind doesn't work because then I can't remove the callback.
[09:34:06] <therealklanni> Case in point: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/4/ another example: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/5/
[09:34:08] <pmercado> to bind autosave to the form I have to write this: $("form").autosave( ... )     is there a way to unbind autosave from the form
[09:34:09] <pmercado> ?
[09:35:24] <therealklanni> Depending where I bind the function, I either can't bind the object, because it's trying to reference itself outside of it's own scope, or I can't unsubscribe my callback because of how Function#bind works
[09:37:16] <charas> Is it possible to get select menu just like MS Word in jquery
[09:37:16] <sheilablackrose> hi guys im trying to pass a sting as an ajax post. but it keeps coming up as name instead of value
[09:37:42] <charas> Basically a select menu which lets you select from predefined values as well as let them input a value they want
[09:38:29] <therealklanni> In short the goal is to fulfill 2 conditions: "this" === the object itself, the callback can be unsubscribed
[09:39:58] <catcher> sheilablackrose, what do you mean it's coming up as a name instead of value?
[09:40:14] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/eaVJ3/
[09:40:21] <sheilablackrose> when i check in fiddler
[09:40:36] <sheilablackrose> there two column right one name n one value
[09:40:45] <sheilablackrose> usually the name is the variable n value is the data
[09:40:55] <sheilablackrose> in this case the name is the data
[09:40:58] <sheilablackrose> n value empty
[09:41:14] <catcher> sheilablackrose, are you meaning to form an array?
[09:41:23] <sheilablackrose> nope just a normal string
[09:42:11] <catcher> sheilablackrose, but if you want a key/val pair, aren't you meaning to form an array?
[09:42:25] <sheilablackrose> no i dont need a key value pair
[09:42:31] <sheilablackrose> i just want to past a normal string
[09:42:38] <sheilablackrose> which usually seem to work
[09:42:44] <sheilablackrose> but for some reason its not working
[09:43:28] <sheilablackrose> is there anything wrong with the code?
[09:43:34] <catcher> sheilablackrose, ajax's data expects a key/val pair.
[09:43:42] <catcher> sheilablackrose, I'm not sure how else to say it :)
[09:43:57] <sheilablackrose> oh you mean the post methods wants a key value pair
[09:43:57] <sheilablackrose> ?
[09:44:31] <sheilablackrose> so do i do like var data=[]; data[0] = "new name"
[09:44:32] <catcher> You're passing 'results', which contains a string.
[09:44:32] <sheilablackrose> ?
[09:44:34] <sheilablackrose> like that
[09:45:02] <sheilablackrose> so what do i do if i just want to pass a string with th evalue "new flag"
[09:45:06] <catcher> It'd make more sense to form flagname properly
[09:45:35] <catcher> just give it a key.
[09:45:50] <sheilablackrose> sorry how do you give it a key?
[09:46:30] <catcher>     flagName['key'] = "new flag";
[09:46:40] <sheilablackrose> ohhh
[09:46:45] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[09:46:49] <catcher> np
[09:47:35] <therealklanni> No one with $.Callbacks and/or Function#bind experience?
[09:47:41] <therealklanni> (read up)
[09:52:10] <sheilablackrose> hi catcher at least now im getting two values but both are undefined http://jsfiddle.net/eaVJ3/1/
[09:52:13] <sheilablackrose> please check
[09:54:47] <sheilablackrose> ahh nvm i got it
[09:54:48] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[09:57:49] <catcher> sheilablackrose, np, glad it's worked out
[10:06:31] <M4d3L> hi. how I play with the current item in like :  $(".login input[type=submit]").live('click', function(){ ... }
[10:07:56] <catcher> M4d3L, $(this)
[10:08:30] <unblockgames> hi all
[10:12:01] <unblockgames> i have programmed a live search with ajax and jquery. i have it set to query on keyup. the issue is i wish it didn't query until there was some delay to prevent it from trying to query so often
[10:12:05] <unblockgames> like a delay of some kind
[10:12:20] <ajpiano> like when they "stop typing?"
[10:12:31] <unblockgames> i dont want it spamming my server with request while they are trying to type ya know
[10:12:39] <ajpiano> unblockgames: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[10:23:59] <Caelum> I need to make a form that looks like this; http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3793/screenshot20121228at102.png can jqueryui help me?
[10:24:12] <Caelum> or is this something you do in pure css
[10:24:35] <systemfault> Normal HTML + CSS
[10:24:45] <systemfault> A bit of JS for the behaviors...
[10:25:16] <systemfault> You "could" use jQuery UI to make some elements look nicer but it's optional in your case.
[10:26:35] <Caelum> I see, that's going to be a bitch, especially since my CSS is very weak
[10:28:59] <Caelum> maybe I should look into extjs designer or something
[10:29:13] <systemfault> Take your time to learn CSS, it will also make you a better JS (DOM) programmer.
[10:29:51] <Caelum> yah, I got some css ebooks on amazon, it's definitely an area I want to improve
[10:31:28] <Kakera> is there a way to set children directly
[10:31:44] <Kakera> something like $(parent).setChildren(arrayOfElements)
[10:32:07] <systemfault> Depends... .html() in some cases, .append in others.
[10:32:25] <systemfault> $(parent).html('<span>LOL</span>');
[10:34:48] <Kakera> I have an array of objects (non-jQuery) and I want to first map them into HTML elements
[10:36:05] <systemfault> Kakera: You're not helping us to help you :/
[10:36:07] <systemfault> More info.
[10:36:19] <Caelum> Kakera: http://jsfiddle.net/dsZ2n/
[10:37:54] <Kakera> Caelum, thanks, that should work
[10:38:15] <therealklanni> With $.Callbacks is there a way to set the scope of the callback? I want to set the scope, similar to Function#bind. Using Function#bind doesn't work because then I can't remove the callback.
[10:38:19] <therealklanni> Case in point: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/4/ another example: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/5/
[10:38:57] <Kakera> Caelum, any reason to use html('') over empty()?
[10:40:21] <Caelum> Kakera: none, I'm still not a jquery expert :)
[10:40:57] <therealklanni> where is aj when you need him? ;p
[10:41:04] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/1/ I am trying the hide a cloned element, but unable to. kindly suggest what is going wrong ?
[10:43:05] <Caelum> rabbi1: you are creating a new element, so you have to bind a click handler to it
[10:43:20] <Caelum> rabbi1: put your .click() code in a function and call that function after creating a new element
[10:43:38] <systemfault> Or use event delegation instead (The second form of .on)
[10:43:55] <Caelum> rabbi1: otherwise the .click() handler will only bind to the elements that exist at the time
[10:44:13] <Caelum> or what systemfault said :)
[10:44:33] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/2/
[10:44:38] <therealklanni> I'm beginning to wonder if Addy is the only person to ever use $.Callbacks
[10:45:01] <rabbi1> delegate and on were in place of live().... go to check more docs... :) thank you guys
[10:45:21] <systemfault> therealklanni: What's the problem again?
[10:45:45] <therealklanni> With $.Callbacks is there a way to set the scope of the callback? I want to set the scope, similar to Function#bind. Using Function#bind doesn't work because then I can't remove the callback.
[10:45:48] <therealklanni> Case in point: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/4/ another example: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/9qgxR/5/
[10:46:18] <rabbi1> *got to, sorry mistyped ...
[10:46:34] <systemfault> therealklanni: Would it work with $.proxy
[10:46:40] <therealklanni> Basically I want to be able to maintain my widget's scope in the callback but also still be able to unsubscribe the callback. Right now I can only do one or the other
[10:48:00] <therealklanni> Hmm I didn't know about proxy. Can you look at my example and see how I am trying to do it? The issue seems to largely be that this all happens in a jqui widget factory object
[10:48:18] <therealklanni> Maybe you can quickly determine if $.proxy would be any different?
[10:48:33] <shoky> therealklanni: http://jsfiddle.net/9qgxR/6/
[10:48:35] <KarateKip3> Hallow! Is it possible to drag & drop a bookmark from Firefox on the webpage, and then jQuery uses that bookmark for some purpose? For example, jQuery will put that bookmark into a nicely decorated christmas tree or something. As far as I know drag & drop is only possible from file broswers or drag & drop from / to the page itself.
[10:48:53] <systemfault> therealklanni: I don't think so to be honest.
[10:49:36] <therealklanni> systemfault: You don't think it will help, you mean?
[10:49:53] <shoky> therealklanni: it works fine, no?
[10:50:03] <therealklanni> shoky: checking
[10:50:10] <shoky> you were removing a new function..
[10:50:16] <shoky> trying to remove, that is
[10:50:31] <systemfault> therealklanni: I think $.proxy will do the same as Function.bind
[10:50:50] <systemfault> shoky's right :)
[10:50:54] <systemfault> (He always is)
[10:51:01] <therealklanni> shoky: that isn't an option, because the function has to be within the widget definition, so imagine those calls to topic function are part of an init function in the widget definition (myObj)
[10:51:14] <therealklanni> systemfault: I suspected as much
[10:51:40] <shoky> gtg
[10:51:56] <therealklanni> shoky: in other words, I don't have the option to define the function outside of the object, I only did it there for the example
[10:52:07] <therealklanni> bleh
[10:52:39] <therealklanni> The only thing I've found that works is defining all my callback functions in the create method of the widget :/ so not elegant
[10:53:21] <therealklanni> Anyway, I knew that example was removing a new function, that was the point of that example, to show why it doesn't work
[10:53:50] <therealklanni> If you look at example 4, I show another way that resolves that, but has the issue of not being able to assign the scope properly
[10:54:40] <therealklanni> Guess I'm just stuck doing it the ugly way
[10:58:22] <tripflex> so i'm using php to upgrade a file on the server and want to display the progress using jquery/ajax
[10:58:31] <tripflex> right now i have it working correctly using .load
[10:58:45] <tripflex> but that loads the entire page and just pulls the selector #theresult
[10:59:15] <tripflex> well i think i answered my own question in my head
[10:59:15] <tripflex> hahah
[10:59:43] <systemfault> We're your rubber duck :)
[11:00:16] <therealklanni> Also, we make bathtime fun
[11:00:23] <tripflex> haha well i'm just gonna go ahead and write everything using this method and then i can look at it later to optimize it
[11:00:47] <tripflex> i do have a question someone might know though
[11:00:54] <therealklanni> 42
[11:01:00] <tripflex> so using .load it replaces whatever the selector is
[11:01:08] <systemfault> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[11:01:10] <Schrostfutz> can i create elements from plain html code with jquery?
[11:01:14] <tripflex> so when i use .load('upgrade.php', 'step=1')
[11:01:27] <systemfault> Schrostfutz: var fragment = $(html_here);
[11:01:31] <tripflex> it changes the selector to that output
[11:01:38] <tripflex> is there a way to have it append instead of replace?
[11:01:56] <tripflex> so in theory is something like this possible
[11:02:01] <therealklanni> systemfault: my rubber duck is a little Tux figurine :)
[11:02:21] <Schrostfutz> systemfault: does that accept complexer html as well? something like $('<div><div....iv></div>')....?
[11:02:38] <rabbi1> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/3/  used slideUp and slideDown instead of show() and hide() but the Clone doesn't work after closing all cloned element and re cloning it.... little strange
[11:02:41] <systemfault> Schrostfutz: Yeah.
[11:02:52] <Schrostfutz> systemfault: thats great, thanks!
[11:03:04] <tripflex> $('#result').load('upgrade.php #status', 'step=1')
[11:03:13] <tripflex> but instead of replacing what is in #result
[11:03:15] <tripflex> append it instead?
[11:04:07] <systemfault> tripflex: Not sure .load does that.. perhaps you could write a http service that returns json and build your markup from it
[11:04:30] <Whirl3d> tripflex, load into a hidden div and swap them
[11:04:35] <tripflex> well using that code above, whatever is returned from #status replaces what is in #result
[11:04:35] <Whirl3d> or append them
[11:04:50] <Caelum> tripflex: $.ajax('upgrade.php', { dataType: 'html', success: function(data) { $('#result').append(data) } })
[11:05:00] <Caelum> tripflex: something like that
[11:05:03] <noregret> does anyone use the fineuploader plugin ?
[11:05:21] <systemfault> rabbi1: Your code is weird...
[11:05:30] <tripflex> yeah right now i'm having to first load into a different div
[11:05:33] <tripflex> then append it
[11:05:56] <tripflex> i was just wondering if there was a way to do it all in one
[11:05:58] <systemfault> rabbi1: give me a minute
[11:07:19] <tripflex> Caelum, could that be used in a .load setup?
[11:07:27] <tripflex> just trying to not confuse myself too much still learning
[11:07:30] <rabbi1> systemfault: :) yeah, no probs.....
[11:08:39] <tripflex> so here's what i have to do right now
[11:08:42] <tripflex> 	$('#upgraderesult').load(loadUrl + ' #statusreturn', 'section=upgrade&step=1', function(){
[11:08:43] <tripflex> 		$('#upgradestatus').append('<p>Step 1 Complete...</p>');
[11:09:15] <tripflex> but i would like to use what is in #statusreturn and append it to #upgradestatus
[11:09:30] <tripflex> that way i can have it dynamically output what is coming from the php file
[11:09:38] <tripflex> instead of hard coding it into the js file
[11:09:43] <systemfault> rabbi1: Wouldn't that work http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/5/ ?
[11:12:36] <rabbi1> systemfault: sorry, that's entirely wrong, its cloning only the <a> tag.... checking it out
[11:13:04] <rabbi1> systemfault: guess, a little typo
[11:13:10] <rabbi1> will be right back
[11:13:11] <Whirl3d> tripflex, use ajax (like Caelum said) since load is a shortcut for .ajax (or perhaps it's the other way around, can't remember) but even if you insist on using load, in your callback, just $("#upgradestatus").append($("#upgraderesult'));
[11:13:26] <systemfault> rabbi1: Wrap the content in a span/div, text nodes are difficult to work with.
[11:14:34] <tripflex> Whirl3d, thanks i'll read up on the documentation, i don't really care the method used i just wanted to keep it as simple as possible as i'm still learning
[11:14:40] <tripflex> trying not to get myself too confused yet :)
[11:15:04] <Whirl3d> ajax is really simple, seriously
[11:15:17] <systemfault> Async can be difficult for beginners..
[11:15:33] <rabbi1> systemfault: sorry, that's getting totally wrong, its actually cloning 2x of the cloned element....
[11:15:36] <systemfault> But once you get that part... AJAX is easy.
[11:16:13] <Whirl3d> I guess I never learned sync? I started with AJAX and just assumed that it was all like that. haha
[11:16:19] <tripflex> yeah well i understand that now and i figured it out after i was wondering why it wasn't waiting for the script to complete haha
[11:16:49] <tripflex> so i'll do some reading up on ajax and datatype
[11:16:52] <tripflex> thanks for your help guys
[11:17:47] <Caelum> argh, I can't figure out jsfiddle's echo api
[11:18:26] <tripflex> can i pass the options
[11:18:27] <tripflex> ie
[11:18:33] <tripflex> $.ajax('upgrade.php?step=1',
[11:18:38] <unblockgames> ajpiano, thank you very much for assisting me. The link you provided me with enabled me to do exactly what i needed to do
[11:18:40] <tripflex> i would assume yes?
[11:18:40] <unblockgames> thanks again
[11:18:50] <ajpiano> unblockgames: quite welcome
[11:22:34] <Caelum> tripflex: sure
[11:23:02] <Caelum> tripflex: but even better, you can do: $.ajax('upgrade.php', { data: { step: 1 } ...
[11:24:02] <tripflex> awesome, thanks for your help Caelum
[11:25:21] <Caelum> tripflex: does it work? I'm not sure if in the success handler you have to do .append($(data)) to make it an element or if just .append(data) would work. I was going to do an example on jsfiddle but I can't figure out their echo api
[11:26:11] <tripflex> lol i appreciate it, i'm putting together some code to test i'll report back in a couple minutes
[11:27:49] <tripflex> from reading through the jquery ajax page though ajax is definately the way to go
[11:29:31] <manster> hey guys do divs register the hover event?
[11:29:41] <manster> i'm trying to use this line $('div.quicklink-row').hover(function().... to get a simple window alert to pop up on hover, but this is not working
[11:30:15] <Caelum> tripflex: http://jsfiddle.net/HCCYv/1/
[11:30:23] <NickWebman> hi. I have an iframe in a lightbox. I want to be able to get the contents of a div FROM the page under the lightbox, and do stuff with it on the iframe itself. Is that possible?
[11:30:29] <Caelum> fuckers, they made /echo/html/ work but not /echo/html
[11:30:40] <rabbi1> systemfault: i guess you can please ignore if you are still with that.. i think i can live now with show() and hide()
[11:30:44] <tripflex> sweet
[11:31:13] <Caelum> NickWebman: if they are in the same domain
[11:31:23] <NickWebman> Caelum: they are
[11:31:40] <Caelum> NickWebman: then yeah, you can poke into the iframe's document and do stuff with it
[11:32:11] <Caelum> also, does anyone else find jsfiddle's auto-indent absolutely infuriating?
[11:32:21] <NickWebman> Caelum: i want to do the opposite. Poke into the page below the light box's iframe.
[11:33:58] <thirdender> NickWebman: parent.document?
[11:34:05] <thirdender> (coming in late to the convo)
[11:34:23] <tripflex> Caelum, i was using .load('upgrade.php #statusreturn')  how would that be converted to using .ajax to get only #statusreturn
[11:34:39] <NickWebman> thirdender: I will check that out. I'm still a newb w/ query. Thanks
[11:34:47] <rabbi1> good night
[11:35:01] <raj> if I save a reference to an element in an array, and I move that element, will that reference still work?
[11:35:03] <systemfault> tripflex: Can be a pain, you have to first strip out the scripts, then create a DOM fragment then select the required nodes
[11:35:21] <systemfault> raj: Yeah.
[11:35:29] <raj> $('#someparent #myelement') which then moves to $('#anotherparent #myelement')
[11:35:32] <thirdender> NickWebman: you can pass an element as context when creating a jQuery object... try $("your selector", parent.document) and see if it works. Remember, both documents are subject to cross-domain restrictions (have to be same domain/subdomain)
[11:35:33] <raj> ok
[11:35:37] <raj> thanks systemfault
[11:35:38] <tripflex> hmm
[11:36:14] <Caelum> tripflex: what does that do, select a div in the html you are loading?
[11:36:17] <NickWebman> thirdender: excellent. I will try that. thank you.
[11:36:25] <tripflex> Caelum, yes correct
[11:36:30] <tripflex> since this is for a plugin for another software
[11:36:40] <tripflex> there's a lot of other bs data returned
[11:36:59] <tripflex> so i was using php to put the status into a specific div
[11:37:08] <systemfault> tripflex: You could .load in a hidden div then get the nodes you need, append them to the results and finally remove the useless nodes from that hidden div
[11:37:11] <tripflex> then pulling it using .load('upgrade.php #status'
[11:37:35] <Caelum> tripflex: easy: http://jsfiddle.net/HCCYv/2/
[11:37:55] <tripflex> ah filter
[11:38:07] <tripflex> awesome, Caelum you're the man you don't know how much i appreciate this
[11:38:14] <tripflex> would have taken me an hour at the least just to figure it out
[11:38:47] <tripflex> systemfault, i appreciate it but i'm trying to avoid having mutlipel divs
[11:39:03] <tripflex> .filter works perfect
[11:39:24] <systemfault> Caelum's way is good if the page doesn't contain script tags..
[11:39:57] <tripflex> i may just create a separate php file and strip all the formating from the application
[11:40:02] <tripflex> that way there's less data to process
[11:40:39] <tripflex> systemfault, what do you mean?  how would that cause a problem?
[11:40:50] <systemfault> tripflex: Usually, for dynamic applications like that, you would have a service returning JSON, then you would dynamically create your markup from it.
[11:41:23] <tripflex> oh man so much to learn :)
[11:42:30] <systemfault> tripflex: Not sure how jQuery.ajax handles script tags, if it simply uses innerHTML, it might die.
[11:42:48] <M4d3L> "Failure"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 2"  data: no] what this mean?
[11:43:30] <M4d3L> code : http://paste2.org/p/2661655
[11:43:30] <tripflex> well from a server point of view looks like you have a nameserver failure
[11:44:59] <M4d3L> if I use the link in the browser it work. (its hybridauth login script)
[11:45:07] <M4d3L> same link in this ajax call is not work
[11:45:31] <tripflex> because in your browser you're using your nameservers configured on your computer
[11:45:45] <tripflex> when running through server you use server dns
[11:45:49] <tripflex> my assumption
[11:46:09] <M4d3L> its both client side.
[11:46:25] <tripflex> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5686377/0x80004005-ns-error-failure-nsidomhtmlformelement-submit
[11:46:33] <tripflex> maybe?
[11:46:47] <tripflex> oh yeah that's right! haha oh man obviously i'm still learning
[11:50:04] <manster> any thoughts on the ability to apply the hover effect to a div??
[11:50:06] <tripflex> ah yes it is very simple with json and php
[11:50:12] <tripflex> can convert array into json very easy
[11:50:31] <tripflex> manster, what do you mean..thoughts?
[11:51:55] <manster> i'm wondering if the code i posted earlier should work http://pastebin.com/vDkMFGe4
[11:52:08] <manster> i'm trying to have the hover event fire when the mouse hovers over a div
[11:54:02] <systemfault> manster: If you want help, use a live pastebin like jsfiddle.
[11:56:06] <tripflex> could maybe use .mouseenter .mouseleave?
[11:56:28] <tripflex> i don't know enough to help but from what i found on google it should
[11:56:45] <manster> systemfault: alright here it is. http://jsfiddle.net/.  code seems to work fine here. perhaps the problem is coming from using drupal 7
[11:56:56] <tripflex> lol
[11:57:05] <manster> http://jsfiddle.net/tmXfW/ *
[12:00:21] <NickWebman> thirdender: I gave your suggestion a go. It doesn't appear to be working. Did I do it correctly? -> http://jsfiddle.net/hnwyh/
[12:00:22] <systemfault> manster: Seems to work here...
[12:05:50] <NickWebman> thirdender: i'm an idiot. figured it out :)
[12:06:11] <thirdender> NickWebman: lol, I was just about to re-work it :-p It's working correctly now?
[12:06:42] <NickWebman> thirdender:  yea. i had parent.document on the wrong selector.
[12:07:22] <thirdender> cool :-p
[12:09:33] <NickWebman> thirdender: thanks again. how many pages back can parent.document go? e.g. can I go back two parent documents?
[12:10:46] <thirdender>  NickWebman: if I remember right, you just keep adding parent.parent.parent... or if you're looking for the top-most document, just use window.top (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.top)
[12:11:06] <NickWebman> thirdender: oh awesome. that is super useful. thanks again.
[12:11:11] <thirdender> np
[12:31:20] <Caelum> systemfault: if you're just creating a wrapped set from raw html, script tags shouldn't matter
[12:32:21] <Caelum> systemfault: apparently it automatically removes script tags
[12:33:12] <systemfault> Ah, good then :)
[12:35:21] <BillCriswell> I love me some underscore. I just wish i didn't need to load another library.
[12:36:23] <Caelum> I'm pondering using ext designer for this project
[12:36:38] <Caelum> anyone try that?
[12:37:29] <BillCriswell> Caelum: I have not. It looks neat though. I'm just skeptical of everything I come across that seems too good to be true.
[12:39:00] <Caelum> BillCriswell: yeah, I tried some gui makers like wxGlade, and they were crap
[12:41:18] <BillCriswell> Caelum: Yeah. I need to use something a lot to get good things out of it. I just need to make sure that initial time investment is worth while, you know?
[12:44:05] <M4d3L> is there a way to make crossdomain ajax request?
[12:44:27] <meckanism> M4d3L: use jsonp
[12:44:35] <systemfault> M4d3L: Only on modern browsers... it also needs server-side modifications.
[12:44:46] <M4d3L> ... :/
[12:45:01] <meckanism> security sucks :)
[12:45:19] <systemfault> JSONP works on all browsers but is very limited
[12:45:27] <systemfault> (It's an ugly hack)
[12:46:01] <skypce> hello people
[12:46:04] <skypce> can you helpme please
[12:46:23] <skypce> how can i fix the background of this page?http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/as/node/4
[12:46:33] <skypce> i try with clear
[12:46:37] <skypce> but nothing appends
[12:47:52] <systemfault> skypce: background-attachment: fixed; on the body?
[12:48:01] <innociv_> Ehh.  How can I get this code to go "in order" without using a callback? indexeddb is asynchronous.   http://pastebin.com/WH2Kjd8T
[12:48:07] <skypce> very thank you systemfault
[12:48:57] <systemfault> innociv_: You cannot make an async function... sync.
[12:49:29] <innociv_> Is there a way I can have ev.source.postMessage() not fire until stating it's ready to? Sort of like a while() but in reverse?
[12:49:51] <skypce> systemfault:  very thank you works very fine :D happy new year
[12:49:57] <systemfault> innociv_: By adding it inside the callback
[12:50:11] <systemfault> skypce: You're welcome.
[12:50:44] <innociv_> But I have a ton of things, that all end with "ev.source.postMessage()".  I'll have to put a callback for every single one then.
[12:50:45] <systemfault> innociv_: You could wrap that code into a nicer function
[12:52:19] <systemfault> innociv_: I would definitely wrap that code into a nice function taking a callback or using $.Deferred (Or another promise library)
[12:55:05] <systemfault> innociv_: Something more or less like that would be the simple approach http://jsfiddle.net/PfUtF/
[12:56:21] <systemfault> A promise implementation can make the code a lot nicer
[13:00:02] <innociv_> systemfault, it'd be easiest to wrap the end in a function, and just do end() after the indexeddb stuff is finished.  I just have to put end() behind like 20 things.
[13:00:08] <innociv_> I just hate repeating things over and over.
[13:04:18] <noregret> does anybody use the fineuploader plugin ?
[13:05:32] <Caelum> can anyone explain this: http://jsfiddle.net/AE2a3/
[13:06:43] <Caelum> I should see the <span> tags in the alert box
[13:07:24] <snollux> Hello! I'm trying to make a sprite animation, and I'm wondering how I can actually get the timeout/delay to work. http://pastebin.com/iPALHCG7  <<-- evidently the setTimeout is just scheduling something elsewhere, not really doing a wait / lock.
[13:07:59] <snollux> Basically, I want there to be a delay between the execution of the .css() statement and the next iteration of the loop
[13:08:01] <Innocentus> hi
[13:08:19] <Innocentus> I heard that jquery can also do a AJAJ (JSON instead of XML) - how to switch this on?
[13:08:29] <Caelum> snollux: why don't you use animate
[13:09:08] <Caelum> Innocentus: dataType: 'json' in .ajax
[13:09:17] <snollux> Caelum: can I do discrete steps in .animate()?
[13:09:27] <Caelum> snollux: I believe so yes, look at the docs
[13:09:34] <snollux> as in, not move smoooothly between 0px and 100px, but a whole jump
[13:09:43] <snollux> and then jump to 200,px 300px and so on
[13:10:01] <Innocentus> Caelum: I guess AJAJ requests are smaller than AJAX requests?
[13:10:05] <Caelum> snollux: if not, there's .delay and .done
[13:10:29] <Caelum> Innocentus: these days, by AJAX everyone means JSON, no one uses XML
[13:12:03] <Caelum> Innocentus: if you're writing an API, see this really awesome document: http://www.scribd.com/doc/115434545/Untitled?secret_password=1k0wg8312b9c87ai0y84#full
[13:12:04] <Innocentus> AJAJ
[13:12:27] <Caelum> Innocentus: right, even though the X in AJAX stands for XML, no one uses XML
[13:12:37] <Caelum> Innocentus: and no one says AJAJ
[13:12:53] <Innocentus> Caelum: you made theat book?
[13:13:02] <Caelum> Innocentus: hell no
[13:16:31] <systemfault> Caelum: REST is sexy even if nobody does it.
[13:18:42] <Innocentus> I would use REST for an api
[13:18:47] <Innocentus> currently I use soap
[13:19:37] <Caelum> systemfault: what do you mean? and what do you mean by REST? I try to write REST routes for my API, but the people in #rest mean something completely different by REST that has nothing to do with APIs
[13:19:38] <systemfault> SOAP is the classic :P
[13:20:20] <systemfault> Caelum: Well... REST is the level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model.
[13:20:33] <systemfault> Verb+resources+mime-types+hypermedia
[13:20:44] <systemfault> What some also call HATEOAS
[13:20:54] <Caelum> systemfault: yeah I understand that
[13:21:14] <Caelum> systemfault: but the people in #rest say "URLs are an implementation detail, your APIs should be accessed by robots"
[13:21:49] <Caelum> systemfault: well some do, half the time you get helpful people there :)
[13:22:28] <systemfault> Caelum: That's true because what you use are links.. not the urls themselves
[13:22:54] <systemfault> The API should be autodiscoverable using links
[13:23:18] <Innocentus> systemfault: soap provides autodiscoverability
[13:23:21] <systemfault> Those links can be part of the payload envelope or by using the Link HTTP header for example
[13:23:40] <systemfault> Innocentus: In REST, it's not as well specified... there's more than a single way to do it.
[13:24:14] <systemfault> Innocentus: With XML, it's a bit easier because you can base your REST API on ATOM
[13:25:24] <noregret> does anybody use the fineuploader plugin ?
[13:31:49] <systemfault> Zz
[13:36:20] <Caelum> Innocentus: you mean the WSDL which gives you the functions, you still need to know what function to call. For a JSON API you just write an API reference doc.
[13:36:55] <Caelum> systemfault: is there a book on this or something?
[13:40:25] <systemfault> Caelum: Unfortunately... I never found a definitive source on that... I read "REST in Practice", "RESTful web services" and everything I was able to find on google... then I watched a few videos on the subject
[13:41:01] <systemfault> It was a presentation on hypermedia+restfulie that made me understood how nice discoverability and links are.
[13:41:25] <systemfault> And also that urls shoud be well-formed but that in fact, they don't matter for an API
[13:41:31] <systemfault> *should
[13:42:03] <Caelum> systemfault: I see, thanks
[13:43:54] <systemfault> The googlecode link on the #REST's topic contain most of the resources I've seen :/ (I wish I knew about it before)
[13:47:36] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: have you had much experience with backbone?
[13:49:05] <BillCriswell> Ugh. Listening to SEO talk makes me want to vomit.
[13:52:27] <wroathe> BillCriswell: +1
[13:55:30] <Fidelix> Help! I'm calling this function from an ajax success callback, and and by the time it reaches line 13, events.click no longer exists. http://paste2.org/p/2662046
[14:05:35] <wroathe> Fidelix: var events = delete_bt.data('events').clone();
[14:07:02] <shoky> BillCriswell: +100
[14:07:12] <Fidelix> wroathe: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'clone'
[14:07:38] <Fidelix> Let me try delete_bt.clone().data('events');
[14:07:38] <Eviltwin> var events = $.extend({}, delete_bt.data('events'));
[14:07:46] <BillCriswell> When you guys are coding do you have people constantly talking in the office with you?
[14:08:10] <BillCriswell> There's never silence here. It's driving me nuts.
[14:08:11] <anew> lol
[14:08:16] <Fidelix> wroathe: nope.
[14:08:19] <anew> headphones
[14:08:20] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: I tried that before
[14:08:26] <Fidelix> It only works once
[14:08:32] <gen0cide> Im using jquery ajax to post a email to a php script, I dont think its working, what could be wrong?  http://pastebin.com/ZsXqznvX
[14:09:07] <BillCriswell> My boss likes to randomly speak to me and get pissed when I don't hear him. Not sure headphones will work. I think I need a different office.
[14:09:26] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: apparently, it cloned it as an empty array
[14:09:40] <Eviltwin> Fidelix: Then there were no events at that time
[14:09:45] <wroathe> Fidelix: What does .data('events') return for you?
[14:11:05] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: this one actually worked once: var events = $.extend(true, {}, delete_bt.data('events'));
[14:11:16] <Eviltwin> Then use that
[14:11:29] <Fidelix> But it only works once.
[14:12:07] <Fidelix> I guess that's because the events var is only populated once?
[14:12:23] <Fidelix> wroathe: an object full of stuff.
[14:12:24] <Eviltwin> As opposed to?
[14:13:33] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: undefined after the first time?
[14:15:08] <Fidelix> I guess I'm approaching this the wrong way. Eviltwin, I can't get .delegate with the load event to work. Is there a load event for .delegate?
[14:17:23] <Eviltwin> Fidelix: Answered in the "Additional notes" section here: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:17:25] <systemfault> Fidelix: The load event doesn't bubble AFAIK so it shouldn't work with delegate
[14:18:02] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: sorry I can't access jquery.com for some reason. My ISP blocks it, or the other way around. I can't even ping it.
[14:18:04] <systemfault> Useless note: .delegate is dead, use the second form of .on
[14:18:17] <Fidelix> systemfault: I only have jQuery 1.5 available.
[14:18:45] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/4FaTA7ey
[14:18:52] <systemfault> Then .delegate is the way to go
[14:19:32] <systemfault> Fidelix: Try that one: http://jqapi.com/
[14:19:38] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: pastebin is blocked too. Apparently, anything hosted in MediaTemple
[14:20:03] <gen0cide> My function http://pastebin.com/ZsXqznvX isnt submitting to my simple php script <? $userEmail = $_POST['email']; ?> What could be going wrong?
[14:20:11] <tw2113> Fidelix, try jsbin.com
[14:20:24] <Fidelix> tw2113: I use paste2.org. Works wonders.
[14:20:41] <tw2113> jsbin is like jsfiddle though
[14:20:43] <tw2113> interactive
[14:20:50] <Fidelix> tw2113: I know.
[14:20:54] <tw2113> just checking

[14:22:11] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: I managed to read it using a proxy. Thanks.
[14:22:59] <Fidelix> Unfortunately this won't help me.
[14:23:16] <Eviltwin> It means you can't .delegate the "load" event
[14:23:18] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[14:23:28] <Fidelix> Eviltwin: is there something similar?
[14:23:57] <systemfault> .load only works when binding on the node directly..
[14:23:59] <systemfault> Err
[14:24:01] <Fidelix> I could use .click, but Drupal is already binding the .click event, so my code does nothing
[14:24:04] <systemfault> The load event, not .load
[14:24:30] <Fidelix> Thats why I have to store the event somewhere, unbind it, and then run .click
[14:27:18] <superthefredbob> How can I watch for element creation and execute some code when it is created?
[14:27:38] <Fidelix> superthefredbob: that would help me as well
[14:27:57] <Fidelix> superthefredbob: that's usually done with .on()
[14:31:22] <gen0cide> I found my problem, I wasnt calling the function in one of my if else staments lol
[14:31:28] <superthefredbob> yeah, watching for stuff is done with on.  can I also watch for element creation where it has a given class?
[14:31:29] <gen0cide> Thanks for your help
[14:32:04] <Eviltwin> superthefredbob: There's no good way to watch for element creation
[14:32:22] <Eviltwin> Some browsers have or used to have support for it but it has been recognized as a terrible idea
[14:32:35] <Eviltwin> Since frequently your event listener would go and create another element
[14:32:44] <Eviltwin> At which point you'd trigger your event listener again
[14:33:09] <superthefredbob> hm.
[14:33:17] <Eviltwin> Since JavaScript is the thing creating the element, you should be able to use signaling to notify any relevant code
[14:33:49] <superthefredbob> I'm not controlling the code that is doing the creating
[14:33:59] <superthefredbob> it's a plugin
[14:35:37] <superthefredbob> So, I need some way to capture that creation and just attach some css to the element in question.
[14:37:50] <catcher> superthefredbob, many plugins provide a callback after an action like that
[14:38:22] <superthefredbob> catcher: yeah, I'm actually looking right now for one.  This is the jplayer plugin.
[14:38:35] <catcher> superthefredbob, I'd bet it does
[14:38:37] <superthefredbob> once it's playing, I'm golden, but I must be missing the callback
[14:40:04] <superthefredbob> There *is* a discussion on this for initialization of the plugin (https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/pull/63)  but I'm not seeing that it has been included...
[14:40:06] <innociv_> I'm sorry, I'm sure this is documented somewhere but I just can't find it.  With indexeddb, how do I tell what the previous version was onupgradeneeded()?  If someone has a specific version, I need to do one thing.  If it's brand new or a different version, I need to do another.
[14:41:34] <catcher> superthefredbob, what element is jplayer creating that you need to know about?
[14:41:55] <superthefredbob> jp-progress.  I need to be able to make changes to its attributes
[14:43:13] <catcher> superthefredbob, can't you just make your changes after you initialize the player, load the playlist, or whatever?
[14:43:42] <superthefredbob> One would think, but I seem to be running into a race condition
[14:46:13] <catcher> superthefredbob, you've got all kinds of events, ready looks good: http://jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/#jPlayer-events
[14:48:51] <superthefredbob> looking now.
[14:48:56] <innociv_> nvm i thinki found it
[14:53:30] <superthefredbob> catcher: this may work.  thank you :)  and thank you all else that helped
[14:53:39] <catcher> np
[14:54:38] <otherj> hey guys, can anyone help me know why this doesn't prevent the page from acting on the default when i click? https://gist.github.com/8cc2d71b522b8adde41e    … resulting in the page moving down to the anchor
[14:54:40] <innociv_> What is oldVersion set to when indexedDB is opened for the first time?
[14:55:03] <innociv_> ah 0
[15:03:11] <RonWhoCares> I am receiving this error "   NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument   "   I pasted the portion of code directly related to this at http://jsfiddle.net/LcVzT/   Is there something obvious I am missing?
[15:03:47] <catcher> innociv_, you're setting location.hash yourself..
[15:04:02] <innociv_> ?
[15:04:08] <ggdevelop> hello i just getting started and wrote html file but it dosent display as beutiaful app it looks like a standart html.. why?
[15:05:09] <otherj> ggdevelop: i don't know how you expect us to answer that
[15:05:26] <catcher> ggdevelop, did you forget to add magic?
[15:15:57] <nerk> this is a pretty decent irc client.
[15:15:59] <nerk> limechat
[15:19:38] <someprimetime> why the F when using .done() chained to $.post() it sends data back in a malformed JSON string that I need to parse?
[15:26:24] <shoky> someprimetime: maybe that's what your server respondds with..?
[15:26:42] <shoky> are you specifying a dataType
[15:27:42] <someprimetime> oh crap
[15:27:45] <someprimetime> yes i was
[15:27:56] <someprimetime> removed 'json' everything went better than expected; thanks shoky
[15:28:16] <someprimetime> i just found out about done() and fail() and i quite like them
[15:28:17] <shoky> someprimetime: with 'json'  jquery just does the parsing for you
[15:28:26] <shoky> someprimetime: and what you'd get in your callback is the parsed objet
[15:28:28] <shoky> object
[15:28:34] <shoky> not a malformed JSON string..?
[15:28:35] <someprimetime> yeah i needed the object, and not the string
[15:28:45] <shoky> dataType: 'json' should be fine
[15:28:53] <shoky> assuming your server responds with proper JSON
[15:31:28] <RonWhoCares> Hi Shoky
[15:32:26] <shoky> RonWhoCares: hi, you're passing a jquery object as data to an ajax post
[15:32:37] <shoky> RonWhoCares: that can't be good.
[15:32:48] <RonWhoCares> What does this mean in English shoky?
[15:33:03] <shoky> RonWhoCares:  var special_instructions = $("#special_instructions");
[15:33:07] <shoky> special_instructions is a jquery object.
[15:33:21] <shoky> you can't pass that as data to send in an ajax request..
[15:33:36] <shoky> maybe you want its' text, or its value
[15:33:45] <shoky> get those with .text()  or with .val()
[15:33:51] <someprimetime> RonWhoCares: he means grab a value and send that with your ajax post instead of a jquery wrapped object like $('bar')
[15:33:54] <shoky> yea use .val() , i see it's an input
[15:34:17] <shoky> RonWhoCares: http://jsfiddle.net/LcVzT/1/
[15:34:21] <shoky> just added that .val()
[15:34:54] <shoky> prolly more readable like this  http://jsfiddle.net/LcVzT/2/
[15:37:07] <RonWhoCares> ok
[15:44:44] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Thank you VERY much

[15:58:42] <coldhead> that's how i drive out the voices in MY head
[15:58:47] <Hopsy> what
[15:58:49] <Hopsy> :p
[15:59:01] <veQue> ive thought about that
[15:59:09] <veQue> i just makes sense
[15:59:16] <veQue> back on qwerty btw
[15:59:20] <coldhead> hahahah
[15:59:22] <veQue> dvorak 1 me 0
[15:59:23] <coldhead> that was brief
[15:59:26] <shoky> LoL.
[15:59:27] <RonWhoCares> shoky: One last question.  Why aren't the result's posting to:   <div class="ebay_wallet_card_selections_error_container"></div>  ,function(data) { $(".ebay_wallet_card_selections_error_container").html(data);
[15:59:31] <veQue> i do better in the morning
[15:59:33] <tw2113> save me coldhead
[15:59:35] <veQue> my brain is tired
[15:59:40] <coldhead> it was brave of you to try
[15:59:49] <coldhead> what's killing you, venkman
[16:00:01] <tw2113> i'm going through a little bit of Android withdrawl
[16:00:09] <coldhead> innnteresting
[16:00:21] <shoky> RonWhoCares: i don't know.. debug it. console.log stuff, put breakpoints see what's happening, what selectors are working, what 'data' is, etc.
[16:00:23] <veQue> coldhead: numbers exist because if you have five kids and you leave with just four
[16:00:35] <veQue> your cave wife will be very mad
[16:00:49] <coldhead> but, right
[16:00:54] <shoky> RonWhoCares: look at your devtools network tab to see what's up with the request
[16:01:07] <coldhead> do numbers exist independently of this physical world
[16:01:09] <RonWhoCares> ok
[16:01:17] <shoky> RonWhoCares: and put an error handler on the .post
[16:01:35] <coldhead> and if so, how is it that these non-physical things are so involved in this physical world
[16:01:37] <shoky> RonWhoCares:  $.post(...).fail(function(a,b,c) { console.log('post error',a,b,c) })
[16:01:48] <coldhead> able to count it and predict velocities and shit
[16:02:13] <shoky> eh, existence independently of this phsyical world
[16:02:17] <shoky> as if.
[16:02:34] <coldhead> no mathematics is dependent on matter?
[16:02:48] <coldhead> i don't even
[16:03:01] <coldhead> all i know for sure is you can make mathematicians very upset if you ask them about it
[16:03:09] <shoky> first you need to say which sort of "existence" you're talking about
[16:03:18] <coldhead> if you say "do numbers really exist" they will say "i have to go now"
[16:03:27] <shoky> because existence  was first physical-only
[16:03:48] <shoky> until people made up spirit and shit, and the word existence was started to be used in realms not meant for it
[16:03:56] <shoky> and everyone's pretty much confused since
[16:03:59] <shoky> (me included)
[16:04:24] <veQue> coldhead that's like asking if time exists
[16:04:36] <veQue> of course
[16:04:44] <coldhead> yes i suppose it is
[16:05:07] <veQue> it'll take a real abstract view on the mind to not see a way in which time or numbers exist
[16:05:15] <veQue> dont
[16:05:22] <veQue> exist i mean
[16:05:26] <coldhead> but take your einstein relativity stuff, time and matter and energy are all interlinked
[16:05:28] <shoky> pretty simple..
[16:05:35] <coldhead> mathematics seems to model that stuff very well
[16:05:39] <coldhead> but independently
[16:05:41] <shoky> we only experience the present moment
[16:05:44] <shoky> that's all the exists for us
[16:05:54] <coldhead> you can't actually find the number 7
[16:05:57] <shoky> the past is memory that's included in the present moment
[16:06:04] <coldhead> you can find sets with 7 members
[16:06:13] <coldhead> but you can't find Seven
[16:06:18] <veQue> but memory matters
[16:06:25] <veQue> memory of the past
[16:06:31] <shoky> sure does
[16:06:36] <veQue> which is a definite definition
[16:06:41] <shoky> it doesnt matter for the past though
[16:06:47] <coldhead> the past is independent of memory
[16:06:52] <shoky> is it
[16:06:58] <coldhead> if no one remembers a guy falling out of a plane
[16:06:59] <veQue> yes ,, the past can often predict the future
[16:07:05] <coldhead> he's stil going to hit the ground later
[16:07:27] <coldhead> memory is mostly for poets
[16:07:34] <veQue> untrue
[16:07:36] <shoky> derp..
[16:07:43] <coldhead> and old people
[16:07:59] <veQue> if you experience something bad you will be aware of it in the future
[16:08:00] <coldhead> MY MAIN POINT is there's plenty to think about that isn't code
[16:08:11] <veQue> OKAY!
[16:08:13] <coldhead> which might be random but isn't worthless
[16:08:16] <shoky> but you'll only be experiencing it in the present
[16:08:31] <veQue> that's the stuff i usually think about... my main point is it's not productive enough
[16:09:30] <coldhead> if you come up with a good account for the applicability of mathematics to so-called reality i'll give you a shiny penny
[16:09:48] <coldhead> so it won't be totally unproductive
[16:09:54] <coldhead> let me know how that works out
[16:09:54] <shoky> we dont apply things to reality
[16:09:58] <shoky> there is nothing outside reality
[16:10:04] <coldhead> mathematics might be
[16:10:04] * monk3y clears throat
[16:10:43] <shoky> if mathematics wre "outside" reality
[16:10:49] <coldhead> yes?
[16:10:59] <shoky> then that realm that includes this "reality" and that part thats outside, is what i mean by, reality
[16:11:09] <coldhead> i was being a dick to use the word "reality" like it meant something
[16:11:13] <shoky> and if there are other shit, they're real too
[16:11:13] <coldhead> i apologise
[16:11:19] <shoky> otherwise, there aren't other shit
[16:11:54] <shoky> i forgive you coldhead
[16:12:06] <coldhead> what i mean is like, if you have 2 eggs, and another 2 eggs, for a total of 4 eggs, where and how are these rules about 2 + 2 = 4
[16:12:18] <coldhead> and how do they apply themselves to our eggs
[16:12:20] <monk3y> Mathematics is simply a measurable quantification of dimensions and objects so that - like memories - we can use them to communicate/compare/act/react/predict what to do with objects/amounts/measurements in our current reality/realities.
[16:12:32] <shoky> there is no egg
[16:12:36] <shoky> there's just energy and matter
[16:12:40] <shoky> (or just energy?)
[16:12:45] <shoky> in the physical sense, anyway
[16:12:47] <monk3y> .. and the measurements thereof?
[16:12:49] <coldhead> right monk3y but in the absence of dimensions and objects, do numbers still exist?
[16:13:05] <monk3y> If those things were absent, then no.
[16:13:09] <coldhead> you can do it all with set theory
[16:13:15] <coldhead> sets of empty sets
[16:13:27] <coldhead> 4 is the number of elements in { {}, {}, {}, {} }
[16:13:33] <shoky> anyways. i only take to "exist" what is in my experience
[16:13:38] <shoky> which is images around me
[16:13:41] <coldhead> that doesn't seem to require dimensions or objects
[16:13:41] <shoky> no matter where i turn
[16:14:18] <coldhead> so you're saying, shoky, that everything everywhere, mathematics and physics and everything, is something you invented
[16:14:22] <coldhead> and it's all in your head
[16:14:24] <monk3y> coldhead: in your power-set, there is the dimension of number of elements.  And you could say each element is a dimension again (of length/magnitude zero)
[16:14:25] <shoky> invented?
[16:14:31] <shoky> i didn't say who put it there, if anyone..
[16:14:41] <shoky> and i'm only talking about me.
[16:14:49] <shoky> for me, the world revolves around me, LITERALLY
[16:14:56] <shoky> i turn around, and the world literally revolves around me
[16:15:02] <shoky> this world is about me. that is my experience
[16:15:07] <coldhead> right monk3y, so it's not really sensible to say :in the absence of dimensions:
[16:15:11] <coldhead> it can't be done
[16:15:14] <shoky> so sure, i invented it, if you want to put it that way.
[16:15:37] <shoky> of course, i have no reason to believe that your expreince is any different
[16:15:37] <coldhead> i always suspected you were the messiah and the fulcrum of the world, shoky
[16:15:43] <coldhead> i hope nothing bad happens to you
[16:15:49] <shoky> but as far as im concerned, there is only MY experience.
[16:16:00] <coldhead> that's true for me too, shoky
[16:16:04] <shoky> im sure it is
[16:16:05] <shoky> ;]
[16:16:08] <coldhead> all that exists is whatever shoky experiences
[16:16:11] <shoky> heh
[16:16:18] <coldhead> could be worse
[16:16:22] <shoky> not much :(
[16:16:55] <monk3y> Gentlemen (and any lurking gentlewomen); I think we're all missing the bigger question.  If there were no dimensions; could jQuery still select anything?
[16:17:17] <shoky> yeah <head> elements and <scripts> and stuff
[16:17:38] <shoky> deities.
[16:18:36] <monk3y> But without dimensions, there is no energy, no matter, no atmosphere, no materials, no servers, no electricity, no "innernet", no clients, no browsers, no code to server and no browsers to request jQuery nor execute it to 'select' anything.
[16:19:13] <shoky> <head> dont need no energy man.. i can hold dozens of them on my pinky
[16:19:57] <coldhead> a platonic jquery can still select platonic DOM nodes in a platonic realm
[16:20:13] <monk3y> ? .platonic
[16:20:14] <bot-t> monk3y, Couldn't find ".platonic" in jQuery Docs.
[16:20:16] <monk3y> :/
[16:20:19] <coldhead> i don't think they have CSS transitions in the platonic realm though
[16:20:22] <shoky> that's not for beginners tho
[16:20:54] <monk3y> And let's be honest if they did have CSS transitions in the platonic realm, it still wouldn't follow standards.
[16:21:10] <monk3y> Ever tried to get platonic realm browsers into quirks mode?
[16:23:09] <shoky> `k boobies
[16:23:09] <b-ot> (╯°□°）╯︵sǝıqooq
[16:24:13] <jamesaa> any idea why $(".post[data-id=+var+]") isn't working?
[16:24:35] <jamesaa> by not working it doesn't select anything
[16:24:59] <coldhead> javascript doesn't have variable interpolation
[16:25:08] <coldhead> you have to terminate and restart the "string"
[16:25:33] <coldhead> $(".post[data-id="+var+"]")
[16:25:53] <jamesaa> oh. thanks
[16:27:49] <coldhead> in conclusion, http://people.umass.edu/klement/russell-imp.html
[16:28:42] <shoky> oo i've read parts of that
[16:29:34] <shoky> tractatus is cooler tho
[16:29:56] <shoky> or whatever its called. wittgenstein's shit
[16:30:10] <coldhead> that sure is heavy going
[16:48:48] <monk3y> Uh .. anyone know of a/the best place that shows a visual map of all the javascript-based technologies, just to get my head around how much is out there and WHY there's so much?  ie. Javascript->jQuery, Node.js, Backbone, Underscore, CoffeeScript, etc?
[16:51:50] <tw2113> it's all javascript monk3y
[16:52:00] <tw2113> just different libraries/frameworks
[16:52:03] <monk3y> Heh, thanks, I know..
[16:52:03] <zg> is there a selector that removes certain elements from within that selector
[16:52:09] <coldhead> i don't think anyone is foolish enough to try to track all that
[16:52:20] <monk3y> As I said; I know they're all javascript-based..
[16:52:21] <tw2113> 2nd day project for you coldhead
[16:52:28] <coldhead> this is kind of nice http://jster.net/
[16:52:30] <monk3y> But they've been made for shortcuts/convenience/code clarity  etc etc etc
[16:52:32] <zg> like if I have <span class="input">sometext<span class="cursor">&nbsp;</span></span>, what would be the easiest way to get the input text without the cursor
[16:52:37] <coldhead> not really a map but a nice catalog
[16:53:07] <tw2113> i like leaflet
[16:53:40] <coldhead> zg: $('.input').find('.cursor').remove()
[16:53:57] <zg> ah
[16:54:19] <zg> how about gettine ghe fcharacter before a selectd element?
[16:54:21] <systemfault> monk3y: There's too many :/
[16:54:27] <monk3y> I hear ya, systemfault.
[16:54:29] <zg> how about getting the character before a selected element?*
[16:54:30] <monk3y> That's why I asked.
[16:54:45] <systemfault> monk3y: If you have a question about a specific one.. we might be able to help
[16:54:49] <monk3y> It's like I'm just getting back into building, and I find out there's so many new kinds of hammer.
[16:55:13] <tw2113> monk3y, i think you're asking things in the wrong order
[16:55:17] <systemfault> monk3y: The thing is that they're not all hammers..
[16:55:25] <tw2113> maybe better to ask "what do i want to do, and what tools are there to help?"
[16:56:18] <systemfault> monk3y: jQuery abstract the DOM/BOM, Node.js is server-side Javascript, Backbone is a framework that helps dealing with large javascript applications, underscore is a utility library, Coffeescript is a language that compiles to javascript.
[16:56:24] <monk3y> tw2113: of course, I completely agree, but I kept my question project-agnostic because I wanted to know if there was a project-agnostic breakdown out there.
[16:56:55] <monk3y> systemfault: thanks.  I'd found all of their pages and other discussions.  Was looking for a general breakdown.
[16:57:10] <monk3y> coldhead: jster looks like a great start - at least a central place to summarise some/a lot of them.
[16:58:02] <zg> coldhead: what about grabbing the first immediate character before the cursor span? <span class="input">asdf<span class="cursor">&nbsp;</span></span>
[16:58:17] <tw2113> assuming jster covers "most" of them
[16:58:32] <tw2113> :D
[16:59:37] <monk3y> Nah, as I said it looks like "some/a lot", but I'll never assume it covers everything.  Like other languages out there; there are new frameworks spawning all the time, and most of them are simply a subset of improvements over another.
[17:00:25] <coldhead> i'm not sure, zg
[17:00:38] <coldhead> i think you'd either want to use text()
[17:00:42] <zg> coldhead: you're awful
[17:00:46] <coldhead> and then string manipulations
[17:00:56] <coldhead> OR some native text fragment stuff
[17:01:03] <zg> OR stackoverflow
[17:01:03] <coldhead> from the DOM
[17:01:07] <coldhead> which i know nothing about
[17:01:17] <coldhead> it's my first day using the DOM API
[17:01:22] <zg> hi5
[17:01:24] <zg> ##javascript
[17:01:32] <coldhead> yeah good luck with THOSE jerks

[17:03:46] <coldhead> are you on twitter monk3y?
[17:03:53] <monk3y> I  .  .... am.

[17:04:12] <zg> o.o
[17:04:12] <coldhead> can you be more specific monk3y
[17:04:22] <monk3y> More specific about whether I'm on Twitter?
[17:04:25] <monk3y> .. 1?
[17:04:30] <monk3y> (as opposed to 0)
[17:04:33] <coldhead> be more specific about HOW you are on twitter
[17:04:35] <coldhead> and WHO
[17:04:40] <monk3y> Oh heheh.
[17:04:44] <shoky> monk3y, you want a nice overview of the most popular javascript MVC frameworks?
[17:04:45] <coldhead> be specific, give examples
[17:04:54] <shoky> its not what you asked for i know.. but you wont get what you asked for
[17:05:03] <coldhead> zg: that is exactly the kind of thing i had in mind and am afraid of
[17:05:25] <monk3y> shoky: sure.
[17:05:28] <coldhead> shoky: if you are about to recommend something addyosmani wrote...
[17:05:33] <zg> coldhead: lol
[17:05:53] <shoky> coldhead nope..
[17:05:57] <monk3y> coldhead: I use Twitter infrequently through the web.

[17:06:32] <coldhead> kudos shoky
[17:06:41] <coldhead> yeah i respect that monk3y
[17:06:45] <Hopsy> kudos does that still work?

[17:07:28] <snover> BinaryKitten: isn’t it adorable?!
[17:07:30] <monk3y> The question is; if dimensions and objects didn't exist, could I expect you to pay for dinner?
[17:07:55] * monk3y uses a light-comedy back-reference from earlier in the buffer
[17:07:57] <BinaryKitten> snover i do believe that hell hath frozen over
[17:08:08] <gvo> If they didn't exist, then I didn't either and couldn't pay!
[17:08:11] <snover> shoky: that is a terrible article
[17:08:15] <coldhead> wait i have a date? i thought i was chaperoning #jQuery's date with monk3y
[17:08:24] <coldhead> i have no idea what i'm doing
[17:08:30] <coldhead> but i hope someone gets pregnant
[17:08:35] <shoky> snover: what makes it terrible?
[17:08:45] <monk3y> Oh jQuery and I have already dated, married, done our honeymoon and now over the magic.
[17:08:55] <zg> coldhead: it got worse: (((($('.cursor')[0] || {}).previousSibling || {}).nodeValue || "").match(/.$/) || [""])[0]

[17:09:01] <snover> shoky: well, the blatant omission of dojo is probably a good starting point
[17:09:10] <shoky> snover: i thought you'd say that ;]
[17:09:11] <coldhead> that is less readable than perl, zg
[17:09:15] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss
[17:09:28] <snover> “seven top JavaScript frameworks/libraries”
[17:09:31] <zg> lmao
[17:09:33] <coldhead> SHE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE
[17:09:57] <monk3y> Who?  Who doesn't?  What's happening?
[17:10:15] <coldhead> snover doesn't even go here
[17:10:19] <coldhead> she just has a lot of feelings
[17:10:21] <snover> what
[17:10:22] <snover> wat
[17:10:23] <b-ot> yeah i wear on my left but i cant wear ladies watch cause of to much electricity so i wear huge ac/dc watch is cool.
[17:10:23] <snover> wt
[17:10:24] <snover> w
[17:10:44] <snover> shoky: oh well. it just kind of sucks for people that think this list is all that is out there
[17:10:47] <mykul> stash
[17:11:01] <coldhead> guys i am listening to a piano arrangement of beethoven's pastoral symphony SO LET'S ALL JUST TAKE IT EASY
[17:11:15] <mykul> sash
[17:11:15] <mykul> ash
[17:11:15] <mykul> as
[17:11:15] <mykul> a
[17:11:19] <monk3y> I'm listening to the same arrangement, w/Dubstep.
[17:11:21] <coldhead> quite
[17:11:33] <monk3y> It's called: BeetStep.
[17:11:46] <gvo> and this is related to jquery how?
[17:11:50] <monk3y> Uh.
[17:11:51] <monk3y> Sorry.
[17:12:02] <coldhead> what are you, the related to jquery police, gvo ?
[17:12:03] <snover> no yui either but i find less fault there since i’ve never heard of anyone outside of yahoo using it seriously
[17:12:09] <snover> i mean i am sure someone does
[17:12:10] <gvo> lol no
[17:12:27] <coldhead> ?w 9 beet stretch
[17:12:27] <mykul> <joke about facial arrangement>
[17:12:28] <bot-t> coldhead, 9 Beet Stretch - 9 Beet Stretch, by Scandinavian sound artist Leif Inge, is a soundscape made of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Beet_Stretch
[17:12:42] <gvo> I just dropped in to learn about jquery not Beetoven...   ;)
[17:13:10] <coldhead> the two are inextricably linked, gvo
[17:13:31] <gvo> coldhead: OK go for it...
[17:13:52] <monk3y> The irony is that if Beethoven *had* have existed today, he could have transposed any of his works by simply calling $('#stave note').transpose('Fmaj');
[17:13:58] <shoky> snover: well yeah i can't argue with that point.. still what he does have to say is to the point, imo. hopefully people read more than one article ;]
[17:14:17] <coldhead> had existed/were alive
[17:14:19] <coldhead> it's all good
[17:14:36] <gvo> So is there an app that will generate reasonable music randomly?
[17:14:42] <coldhead> the main thing is he didn't link to something addy wrote, snover
[17:14:48] <coldhead> it's nice that that is still possible
[17:14:52] <snover> heh.
[17:15:03] <snover> you scamp.
[17:15:22] <coldhead> gvo: http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/music/
[17:15:24] <shoky> donno about addy's articles, but i'm not a fan of his presentations
[17:17:03] <coldhead> credit where credit is due, he invented MVC
[17:17:17] <coldhead> and the TODO MVC
[17:17:34] <coldhead> and that thing where people shave little strips out of their eyebrows
[17:17:59] <shoky> invented MVC?
[17:18:15] <coldhead> just go with it, shoky
[17:18:25] <shoky> i intend to
[17:18:37] <gvo> coldhead: OK that was interesting, however I gotta think that someone has sucked in a bunch of music, analyzed it and synthetically generated similar original music.  If not, I see my next project.
[17:18:42] <coldhead> is there a drink where you put chocolate syrup in pineapple juice?
[17:18:55] <snover> gvo: it doesn’t work very well.
[17:19:20] <gvo> snover: It's been done?
[17:19:30] <shoky> i'll go play an old jazz standard.. on my guitar.. that instrument thing
[17:19:45] <coldhead> gvo: there is aat least one project that genetically "evolves" music and lets people pick their favorite variations to mimic natural selection
[17:19:59] <coldhead> it sounded awful and i hate everyone who was involved in the enterprise
[17:20:19] <coldhead> i didn't know you played jazz, shoky
[17:20:22] * coldhead takes notes
[17:20:32] <shoky> sure do
[17:20:37] <coldhead> charming
[17:20:43] <shoky> ;D
[17:20:55] <zg> coldhead: anyway to split string by html tag
[17:21:10] <zg> <span class="input">as<span class="cursor">&nbsp;</span>df</span>
[17:21:16] <coldhead> if snover weren't here i'd say you can do it via regular expression
[17:21:21] <coldhead> but as he is, i won't
[17:21:22] <gvo> snover: coldhead  I'm surprised.  Music theory is pretty advanced and I would have thought AI would have been able to grok it.
[17:21:44] <snover> that’s very cowardly of you coldhead
[17:21:53] <coldhead> gvo: it's artificial intelligence, not artifical aesthetic sense
[17:22:06] <gvo> coldhead: You got a point.
[17:22:13] <coldhead> MAYBE IF YOU'D BEEN KINDER TO ME SNOVER
[17:22:50] <tw2113> don't be an ass to coldhead, snover
[17:23:00] <snover> imagine an infinite number of variations of Friday
[17:23:01] <coldhead> no, i deserved it
[17:23:02] <tw2113> he's very used to people being a dick to him
[17:23:11] <coldhead> it's just a shame that zg has to suffer because of it
[17:23:14] <tw2113> you being an ass just confuses him
[17:23:19] <zg> .contents()
[17:23:45] <zg> ???? ????
[17:23:47] <zg> holy shit
[17:23:58] <zg> $('.eleem').contents());
[17:24:00] <zg> lmao
[17:24:04] <zg> wow, this is gonna be fun :)
[17:24:10] <tw2113> you had an extra ) on there
[17:24:18] <zg> yeah, i see
[17:24:32] <coldhead> nothing escapes the righteous vigilance of tw2113
[17:25:08] <zg> bastard
[17:25:12] <zg> I MEAN UH
[17:25:27] <tw2113> it's because it's my 2nd day coldhead
[17:25:32] <tw2113> you level up a lot at that point
[17:25:56] <gvo> tw2113 second day of sobriety?
[17:26:09] <tw2113> 2nd day of jQuery
[17:26:18] <gvo> same thing.
[17:26:30] <tw2113> yeah, true
[17:27:10] <coldhead> i long for that day
[17:27:27] <gvo> sobriety?
[17:27:28] <tw2113> maybe tomorrow coldhead
[17:27:55] <zg> what's nodeType 3
[17:27:56] <coldhead> day two of sobriety is the last thing i need
[17:28:00] <coldhead> waaay too much reality
[17:28:02] <gvo> lol
[17:42:39] <systemfault> Zzz
[17:45:41] <coldhead> bye Hopsy
[17:45:45] <coldhead> bye forever
[17:50:09] <monk3y> That's all a bit final, coldhead.
[18:09:26] <LakWork> is it view all events associated with a dom object?
[18:09:33] <LakWork> is it possible to*
[18:09:52] <LakWork> i used to be able to call $('.selector').data('events')
[18:12:49] <coldhead> that was naughty of you
[18:43:06] <astropirate> Greetings jQuery ninjas and rockstars
[18:44:02] <tw2113> you can see ninjas?
[18:45:24] <jrajav> Me -> http://stanfordflipside.com/images/110ninjaRockstar.png
[18:49:17] <gen0cide> I'm having a small problem, Im trying to POST a string to a php script, It looks like its sending according to tamperdata with "email=email@test.com" , but the script isnt recieving the data
[18:49:17] <gen0cide> http://pastebin.com/y9QgkgWf
[18:49:33] <gen0cide> <? $userEmail = $_POST['email']; ?>
[18:50:48] <monk3y> Aren't you supposed to serialise data to an ajax call?
[18:51:14] <monk3y> So it should be coming through to the PHP page as "&email=blah@blah.com" ?
[18:52:43] <monk3y> gen0cide: meaning - your data property should look like "data: email=a@b.c", or data: jsonVariable.serialise();
[18:53:03] <monk3y> (if there's going to be more info in that structure in the future)
[18:53:53] <monk3y> And have you tried, in the PHP page, dumping all the post vars that are coming through?
[18:55:12] <someprimetime> isn't it $_REQUEST['email'] from the php side? i've been out of it for awhile but i use $this->request->is('ajax') with cakephp
[18:55:25] <Ziber> $_POST
[18:55:28] <Ziber> wouldn't it be?
[18:55:33] <someprimetime> pretty sure either works
[18:58:14] <gen0cide> monk3y: the email is a simple string
[18:58:54] <gen0cide> Should I change the line to: data: { "email": theEmail.serialise() }  ?
[19:10:02] <relipse> i have a list of projects, do I use ajax to add a new product and then repopulate the datatable or do I just submit to a new page and the datatable refreshes upon page load thus showing the new project?
[19:10:34] <gen0cide> Hmm, I got it to work, I removed the line:                  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
[19:22:46] <tripflex> so in theory this is what i am trying to do, but im guessing that won't work because of js being async?
[19:22:48] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/D4kkf/
[19:24:52] <cusco> tripflex: I don't see what's wrong with it
[19:25:05] <cusco> ahh
[19:25:06] <cusco> nvm
[19:25:07] <cattleFraud> tripflex: can you explain the problem?
[19:25:20] <tripflex> well i'm trying to next another ajax inside one another
[19:25:23] <tripflex> *nest
[19:25:32] <cusco> you need to watch for $('#upgradestatus') change, before looping over
[19:25:34] <tripflex> as in to replicate "steps" for the upgrade progress
[19:29:55] <Forrestr> I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this Q.. but has anyone used xeditable, http://vitalets.github.com/x-editable within wordpress? I'm getting a "Cannot read property 'defaults' of undefined" error. I'm Not sure what that means or how to remedy..
[19:29:57] <superthefredbob> how would one remote load an image with jquery and once it's loaded, change the background url of a div to it?
[19:30:19] <superthefredbob> (or to load a "default" image, should that image fail)
[19:32:30] <tripflex> cusco, where would i do that at though?
[19:32:39] <tripflex> should that be before or in that function itself
[19:33:43] <tripflex> would it matter if i used a while loop instead?
[19:52:50] <gen0cide> Should I use .done() instead of success ?
[19:55:54] <monk3y> That's a simple Google question dude.
[19:55:55] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8840257/jquery-ajax-handling-continue-responses-success-vs-done
[19:56:14] <relipse> how do i add one function event for onkeydown and onchange?
[19:56:37] <relipse> i want to verify the username while the user is typing
[19:57:05] <Ziber> .bind(), maybe?
[19:57:25] <tw2113> $('input').on'('keydown',function(){ //validate });
[19:58:16] <relipse> last time i remember there was a problem, it wasn't sending the last character
[19:58:32] <relipse> maybe i need keyup?
[20:07:50] <Ziber> relipse: http://development.jkode.us/js/index.php
[20:08:30] <Ziber> using keyup.
[20:13:30] <relipse> yeah keydown doesnt work
[20:14:11] <Ziber> keyup seems to work just fine.
[20:14:14] <Ziber> :)
[20:19:46] <oojacoboo> how can I build out a post data property with serialize and an array/object I have besides manually appending the values to the xhr?
[20:20:31] <oojacoboo> xhr string*
[20:20:45] <monk3y> oojacoboo: Are you serialising from selected form-fields, or from a JSON object?
[20:21:12] <oojacoboo> serializing with $ DOM obj
[20:21:15] <oojacoboo> the form
[20:21:18] <monk3y> Gotcha.
[20:21:31] <monk3y> If it was a JSON object you could have added the extras straight to it.
[20:21:37] <oojacoboo> right
[20:21:56] <oojacoboo> but I'd rather leave that to be a bit automated so I can always edit the form fields
[20:22:21] <oojacoboo> I have a manually built array as well, that I need to pass along
[20:22:30] <monk3y> Sure.
[20:22:55] <monk3y> I know exactly what you intend to do, and I think I had to do it once .. but not confident I know the 'best 'way.
[20:22:58] <monk3y> h2
[20:23:45] <oojacoboo> yea… I've passed all kinds of things, but this one is a bit unique, the array is currently built as an object and passed with the data property of the $.post method
[20:24:01] <oojacoboo> which of course works great, but I don't have a way to get in my form values as well
[20:24:44] <monk3y> Here's a few links I've found before that helped.
[20:24:44] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5477540/jquery-ajax-data-field-with-mixed-data
[20:25:16] <oojacoboo> monk3y: yea, I've done that before, that's what I was getting at, building it out on the xhr string
[20:25:22] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6627936/jquery-post-with-serialize-and-extra-data
[20:25:48] <oojacoboo> the issue is that I have an array though, and I'd think I'd need to at least url_encode it
[20:25:52] <monk3y> Yeah; but you didn't want to specify the field names specifically, right?  So you can extend it later without having to update the call?
[20:25:53] <oojacoboo> if I went that route
[20:26:19] <monk3y> Look at serializeArray().  The serialize*() functions are supposed to URLencode.
[20:26:19] <oojacoboo> monk3y: well, the array I have to specify b/c it's built in js
[20:26:28] <oojacoboo> but of course for the form, no, I don't want to specify
[20:27:24] <oojacoboo> xhr string building it is I guess :/
[20:28:15] <oojacoboo> wait, that second link was the ticket monk3y
[20:28:24] <oojacoboo> I was thinking that push() might work
[20:28:27] * monk3y nods like he knew all along
[20:28:38] <oojacoboo> :P
[20:29:19] <astropirate> Hello jQuery wielding ninjas
[20:34:46] * monk3y aligns to astropirate's perception that we are, indeed, jQuery 'ninjas', and hides in the shadows
[20:35:54] <gen0cide> My php script is getting the post data and putting it into my db fine, but done() isnt firing but fail() always does:  http://pastebin.com/FZmc8UJf
[20:36:18] <gen0cide> Could it be because Im using method chaning
[20:36:22] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: what's your webserver returning?
[20:36:26] <gen0cide> 200
[20:36:34] <oojacoboo> are you sure?
[20:36:38] <gen0cide> Ya
[20:36:51] <gen0cide> Im using tamper data
[20:37:11] <astropirate> monk3y, with the pay i get for coding jquery stuff, i have no choice but stay in the shadows :(
[20:37:18] <astropirate> they call us ninjas to make us feel good
[20:37:26] <astropirate> about being stuck int the basement cubical
[20:37:51] <monk3y> Basement?  I'm in a small office off a hallway which is off an underground carpark.
[20:38:18] <monk3y> I'm not sure what kind of ninja that makes me .. but I'm pretty sure I'd be heckled by the other ninjas.
[20:38:45] * astropirate is looking for node.js related work
[20:39:31] <gen0cide> oojacoboo: This is the Response => Status=OK - 200 Date=Sat, 29 Dec 2012 04:37:17 GMT Server=Apache Vary=Accept-Encoding Keep-Alive=timeout=10, max=30 Connection=Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding=chunked Content-Type=text/html
[20:40:05] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: I'm not quite sure what to tell ya
[20:40:22] <oojacoboo> I'd have to see it in action and with an ajax call that's hard to do
[20:41:15] <monk3y> Instead of Pastebin, throw it in jsFiddle with a buttload of console.logs and throw it at us.
[20:41:32] <monk3y> (and I mean no less than a metric buttload)
[20:43:33] <astropirate> monk3y, did you hear about the perfect sphere which weighs exactly 1 metric buttload
[20:44:04] <monk3y> Of course.  I have one and use it as my bowling ball.
[20:44:17] <gen0cide> monk3y: How do you get the console logs off of firefox?
[20:44:26] <monk3y> Paint stripper.
[20:44:29] <monk3y> Wait.
[20:44:33] <monk3y> Sorry, it's the coffee talking.
[20:44:35] <gen0cide> I have firebug on here
[20:44:51] <monk3y> You mean for getting this into jsFiddle for us to look at?
[20:44:57] <gen0cide> Ya
[20:45:02] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:45:27] <monk3y> Uh.  You just have console.logs all throughout, then throw that code into jsFiddle, and it just reports it to whomever's reviewing/running your code .. right?
[20:45:34] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: console.log("error");
[20:45:37] <monk3y> I haven't dabbled in this too much, but that's my understanding ..
[20:48:54] <gen0cide> Could I just post the link of the page Im working on?
[20:50:37] <oojacoboo> it's a start
[20:53:55] <gen0cide> http://goo.gl/DC4jj
[20:56:17] <oojacoboo> yay, the Chinese fire balloons :)  I did that in Taiwan, amazing seeing them in the sky
[20:56:45] <gen0cide> Heh ya that pic is from taiwan
[20:56:57] <oojacoboo> it's the only place that does it AFAIK
[20:57:03] <cattleFraud> gen0cide: what's the issue with that link??
[20:57:07] <gen0cide> Someone else picked it to be up there.
[20:57:14] <oojacoboo> and they're thinking about banning it b/c of how it pollutes the hillsides
[20:57:45] <gen0cide> cattleFraud: When you enter an email, it sumbits to the database, but .done() doesnt fire but .fail() does
[20:57:48] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: where is the call?
[20:57:50] <monk3y> gen0cide: this is probably unrelated to your issue (since you're getting a failure), but remember to preventDefault when you're reacting to submit buttons.
[20:57:51] <oojacoboo> k
[20:58:28] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: return something other than the 200
[20:58:31] <cattleFraud> yeah monk3y is probably right
[20:58:48] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: put something in the response back
[20:59:00] <monk3y> It's like your ajax call will be waiting for a response, but the submit button will be trying to reload the page .. even though you don't specify an action.
[21:00:01] <monk3y> Yeah; can we see the code of the PHP page?  Or at least your return statement(s)?
[21:00:53] <gen0cide> This is what I have as of now: http://pastebin.com/3XxUkE3M
[21:01:08] <gen0cide> I now Im using depreciated functions, the new versio nof the site will not
[21:01:15] <gen0cide> know*
[21:01:31] <gen0cide> oojacoboo: How would I do that?
[21:01:46] <oojacoboo> return json_encode(array("success" => true));
[21:02:27] <oojacoboo> then in done(if(success) { console.log("yay") });
[21:02:35] <monk3y> And try changing the .ajax data_type to 'text', so it doesn't expect/try to infer anything from (non-existent) mime-types/headers.
[21:02:39] <oojacoboo> response.success*
[21:03:05] <oojacoboo> set your headers to application/json too on the return
[21:03:06] <gen0cide> oojacoboo: That worked heh
[21:03:10] <oojacoboo> ;)
[21:03:12] <gen0cide> the return statement
[21:03:14] <gen0cide> Thanks heh
[21:03:16] <oojacoboo> yes
[21:03:21] <monk3y> 'cause currently you're saying the data_type is 'json' - which I think you might be assuming is the data_type of what you're *sending*, but it's what you *expect back*, then you're sending "200" back .. but it's not formatted 'json'.
[21:03:28] <gen0cide> Im a newb at web programming
[21:03:40] <oojacoboo> monk3y: na
[21:03:42] <cattleFraud> well this is how you learn!
[21:03:48] <oojacoboo> response back doesn't expect the same
[21:03:58] <monk3y> Doesn't . . . ..... ?
[21:04:04] <oojacoboo> why would it?
[21:04:09] <gen0cide> cattleFraud: Learning on the job heh
[21:04:26] <oojacoboo> it certainly wouldn't cause a fail either
[21:04:35] <oojacoboo> the reason it failed is b/c the response didn't have anything in it
[21:04:52] <oojacoboo> he could have done… return "foo"; and it'd work
[21:05:22] <cattleFraud> Yeah, usually I have PHP either return the string "success" or "fail" and then I let jquery deal with it
[21:05:43] <oojacoboo> cattleFraud: I use to do that, I now return json objects
[21:05:48] <oojacoboo> it's much more elegant
[21:05:49] <cattleFraud> sweet
[21:06:05] <oojacoboo> and I can include all kinds of things in it as well
[21:06:11] <oojacoboo> plus a custom error message ;)
[21:06:19] <cattleFraud> hmm, you got me thinking oojacoboo
[21:06:24] <oojacoboo> yes yes
[21:06:43] <monk3y> Sorry guys, got a phonecall before I could come back with an awesomely damning response to oojacoboo
[21:06:55] <oojacoboo> json_encode(array("success" => false, "error" => "unable to save this b/c of this"));
[21:06:59] <monk3y> Re: data_type/expected return.
[21:07:27] <gen0cide> oojacoboo: Ya that looks sexy
[21:07:30] <gen0cide> Ha.
[21:07:52] <monk3y> I just thought .ajax's data_type is described to be what it expects back, so it might have a problem if it's 'not' that.. etc.
[21:08:02] <oojacoboo> ya, and you set multiple return points too so it returns on error and doesn't fire the rest of the code
[21:08:05] <gen0cide> I made it so !userEmail then return that json object
[21:08:25] <gen0cide> if userEmail is not empty in the php
[21:08:36] <oojacoboo> monk3y: you're correct
[21:08:39] <oojacoboo> sorry
[21:09:00] <oojacoboo> The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4 JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the script, and anything else will be returned as a string). The available types (and the result passed as the first argument to your success callback) are:
[21:09:22] <oojacoboo> I always allow the response headers to set that
[21:09:37] <monk3y> Oh hey no apologies needed .. every time I say something on here I hit enter with crossed fingers, hoping that I'm even roughly correct.
[21:09:47] <gen0cide> So if I I had the datatype set as text, I wouldnt have encountered this problem, as the server was giving me a text 200 status?
[21:10:08] <monk3y> gen0cide: that's my assumption, and hence why I suggested you temporarily change it to text.
[21:10:16] <oojacoboo> maybe...
[21:10:19] <monk3y> (it was just a quick test to see if it fixes it, or changes the issue)
[21:10:19] <gen0cide> OK let me see if that works
[21:10:21] <oojacoboo> I'd still return something though!
[21:10:28] <oojacoboo> but curious :)
[21:10:54] <cattleFraud> yeah returning something is a good idea
[21:10:57] <monk3y> But as oojacoboo suggests, returning a json package is awesome.  You can put anything* in there and introspect it on the client.
[21:11:02] <monk3y> * by anything, I don't mean anything.
[21:11:16] <oojacoboo> gen0cide: https://gist.github.com/4404719
[21:11:34] <gen0cide> I changed the datatype to text, and commented out that return statement in the php, and it also worked
[21:11:35] <oojacoboo> example of a $.post I'm currently working with, showing the response being handled with a json object
[21:12:08] <oojacoboo> github does a bad job on predicting the gist :/
[21:12:12] <oojacoboo> indention that is
[21:12:46] <cattleFraud> what is the difference of using .done as opposed to not using it??
[21:12:47] <gen0cide> Ya returning json objects seems cooler
[21:12:56] <oojacoboo> cattleFraud: deferreds ftw
[21:13:08] <gen0cide> Hides the error messages in the php so users cant see it
[21:13:48] <gen0cide> Thanks, I've learnt a lot with this problem.
[21:15:36] <cattleFraud> Wow you're using javascript to do everything in the dom
[21:15:48] <oojacoboo> you have no idea
[21:16:04] <oojacoboo> it's a full blown ajax app
[21:16:13] <cattleFraud> I wish I had that much time! :)
[21:16:27] <cattleFraud> I do, I'm just lazy :|
[21:17:23] <oojacoboo> I like to return back Ids and things I'm saving with json objects as well
[21:17:33] <oojacoboo> it's extra reinforcement that the save worked
[21:17:43] <monk3y> Yeah oojacoboo: I've only just seen the light wrt ajax apps, and I'm loving it.
[21:17:58] <monk3y> And it saves all the horrors/overhead around page submits and reloads.
[21:18:06] <monk3y> It's so - so much cleaner, and sexier to work with.
[21:18:11] <oojacoboo> yea
[21:18:17] <monk3y> Anyways.
[21:18:34] <monk3y> It's midnight here so I've gotta turn into a pumpkin.  Thanks for the chats fellas.
[21:18:34] <cattleFraud> cleaner is better
[21:18:40] <oojacoboo> and if you take your time creating lots of nice systems in your js, you can dev pretty rapidly
[21:18:49] <oojacoboo> nite
[21:19:43] <cattleFraud> I have a question for yal...
[21:21:05] <cattleFraud> I'm running into a problem where ajax loaded dom elements don't acquire any js functionality. I've used .live to bind the events..
[21:21:31] <oojacoboo> cattleFraud: you need to bind them to a parent element that STAYS in the DOM
[21:21:35] <cattleFraud> So I've resorted to loading js for each element added via ajax. sucky
[21:22:01] <coldhead> live() or on() is how you're meant to do that, and if you do it right it works
[21:22:14] <oojacoboo> $("#parent-element").on("click", "#element-clicked", function(event) { //do stuff });
[21:22:22] <cattleFraud> is that what "bubbling" is for??
[21:22:40] <oojacoboo> cattleFraud: it's binding
[21:22:52] <oojacoboo> bubbling is for events
[21:22:55] <coldhead> bubbling is when you draw smoke through a bong
[21:22:59] <cattleFraud> lol
[21:23:18] <coldhead> it often helps when understanding event binding
[21:23:19] <oojacoboo> also, don't use live()
[21:23:22] <oojacoboo> use on()
[21:23:26] <coldhead> i guess that is why the two are often mentioned together
[21:23:51] <cattleFraud> ok, i've never even used on()
[21:24:09] <oojacoboo> coldhead: is there a selector for attr values?
[21:24:51] <coldhead> $('[title="Some title"]')
[21:24:54] <coldhead> is that what you mean?
[21:24:58] <oojacoboo> ><
[21:25:02] <oojacoboo> bed time
[21:25:06] <oojacoboo> ...
[21:25:12] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[21:25:18] <cattleFraud> I'm confused, why would I attach events to the parent element of ajax loaded stuff in order to get the ajax loaded stuff to work??
[21:25:23] <coldhead> cattleFraud: on() is modern live()
[21:25:35] <oojacoboo> cattleFraud: b/c it stays in the DOM and events are attached to DOM nodes
[21:25:41] <coldhead> cattleFraud: you can't bind to stuff that isn't in the page yet
[21:25:46] <oojacoboo> so if you attach it to an element that gets removed, it goes bye bye
[21:25:46] <coldhead> so you bind to something that is in the page
[21:25:48] <cattleFraud> right, that's the problem
[21:25:54] <cattleFraud> hmm, interesting.
[21:25:59] <coldhead> and when it notices that the event occurs in a child
[21:26:06] <coldhead> if the child matches the selector
[21:26:09] <coldhead> the handler can run
[21:26:25] <cattleFraud> ooohhh, [light bulb goes on in brain]
[21:26:26] <coldhead> binding new handlers when you ajax add stuff isn't THAT icky
[21:27:18] <cattleFraud> That makes perfect sense now! Thank you!
[21:27:44] <coldhead> happy hacking, cattleFraud
[21:30:31] <oojacoboo> shouldn't you use prop with selected?
[21:34:39] <coldhead> probably
[21:34:45] <oojacoboo> definately
[21:35:19] <oojacoboo> I swear, SO seems to have some of the worst responses when it comes to jquery
[21:35:31] <coldhead> because all the best answerers are on IRC
[21:35:39] <oojacoboo> you know it
[21:38:08] <systemfault> oojacoboo: what else? :P
[21:38:46] <oojacoboo> systemfault: what else what?
[21:39:03] <systemfault> oojacoboo: Than prop to use with selected
[21:39:09] <systemfault> .attr? ewww
[21:39:19] <oojacoboo> that's what I'm sayin yo
[21:39:48] <oojacoboo> except resig went back on attr with the hacks
[21:40:28] <oojacoboo> I guess the issue is that, when inspecting an element, it's not always clear that elements have been updated
[21:40:48] <oojacoboo> since the property setting on the object isn't visible in the DOM but within the object's properties
[21:41:14] <oojacoboo> I personally think inspectors should do a better job with this somehow, but w/e
[21:42:04] <systemfault> just select the element to check it yourself :/
[21:42:23] <oojacoboo> and dig through the node properties?
[21:42:48] <oojacoboo> kinda obnoxious and if you're new-ish, that's not obvious
[21:44:07] <systemfault> Select the element with the inspector then…. $0.selected
[21:44:30] <oojacoboo> yes, I know how systemfault, that's not the point
[22:57:05] <innociv_> http://pastebin.com/ay2Jm6h1 Occasionally I'm getting a "idb is undefined' on line 26, which makes no sense to me.  It's a callback that runs after idb is set...
[23:36:33] <relipse> can someone help me with fixing the editor in this: double click a field: http://jsfiddle.net/HS2vk/
