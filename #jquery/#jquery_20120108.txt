[00:04:55] <GoddeR> ^.^ Y_Y
[00:05:44] <coldhead> not many people here work with flash much, GoddeR
[00:05:54] <coldhead> i can only suggest asking google and stackoverflow
[00:06:03] <coldhead> for jquery flash opacity fixes
[00:06:13] <GoddeR> I have :(
[00:06:16] <GoddeR> and still am
[00:06:37] <GoddeR> just figure i would post it here if anyone found it interesting enouhg to look at
[00:07:18] <coldhead> it's the weekend, not a great time for flash :(
[00:07:43] <coldhead> i looked but i don't have fx9
[00:07:43] <GoddeR> i can't really ask in the flash channel
[00:07:58] <GoddeR> you see the issue?
[00:08:19] <eggnogg> i notice that if i click it once, FIRST slides down but not the content until i click again
[00:08:23] <eggnogg> is that intentional?
[00:08:39] <GoddeR> yea
[00:08:47] <GoddeR> to make it collapse click top right
[00:09:15] <GoddeR> i already know the flash works i just stuck in 2 flash files i had
[00:09:38] <GoddeR> then i noticed the flickering
[00:10:39] <eggnogg> im pretty sure it's a problem with queuing/callbacks
[00:11:36] <GoddeR> if possible can you elaborate?
[00:12:01] <GoddeR> once they are on the page nothing is attached to them cept jquery().click
[00:13:45] <eggnogg> the names you gave them confuse me a little but
[00:13:48] <eggnogg>  $(expandCont).animate({
[00:13:52] <eggnogg>   $(container).animate({
[00:14:05] <eggnogg> at the end of your code
[00:14:32] <GoddeR> the expand conter is floating overlayed on the collapsed swf
[00:14:33] <eggnogg> I'm pretty sure your issue is in there
[00:14:44] <GoddeR> the container animate is to push content down
[00:15:43] <eggnogg> No idea man.  All I know is working with flash with js sucks :P
[00:16:10] <GoddeR> Sorry if I sound confusing, The expandCont code is to resize the floating element, the container is to resize the div that is a part of the document and push the content down
[00:16:36] <GoddeR> Thanks for taking a look atleast :)
[00:17:39] <solidus-river> whats the equivalent of unbind for on?
[00:17:44] <GoddeR> off
[00:17:45] <solidus-river> if we on something twice will it get called twice?
[00:17:55] <solidus-river> if we off something thats not on will it throw an error?
[00:18:17] <GoddeR> Not sure.
[00:18:23] <GoddeR> Why would it O:
[00:18:52] <solidus-river> dunno o_O just want to know if its going to stop execution of my code if it doesnt hav it on :P
[00:19:17] <GoddeR> You alway know who your offing ;)
[00:19:22] <GoddeR> you should**
[00:19:22] <GoddeR> :D
[00:20:12] <eggnogg> on stacks
[00:20:47] <eggnogg> offing doesnt throw an error afaik
[00:20:53] <eggnogg> if there are no ons
[00:22:23] <Jeremiah_> Hello

[00:52:19] <Jeremiah_> LOL
[00:52:21] <Web> you homo :|
[00:52:47] <coldhead> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING A HOMO, WEB
[00:53:06] <coldhead> homosexuality is responsible for much of the jQuery we know and love today
[00:53:08] <Web> coldhead, i never said there is a problem, i was just stating he is homo and im not so i dont want to cyber ^-^
[00:53:09] <Jeremiah_> You told me you was a an 20 year old chick in private...
[00:53:16] <Jeremiah_> Faggot.
[00:53:26] <Web> Jeremiah_, show a screen grab if so.
[00:53:35] <Jeremiah_> That is ok though....
[00:53:36] <coldhead> oh please, you two are terrible at cyber
[00:54:04] <sente> this is the worst channel on all of freenode right now
[00:54:04] <Web> ^-^
[00:54:09] <Jeremiah_> I am ok with you young people and your homo crap...
[00:54:17] <Web> sente, i actually like this channel ^-^
[00:54:28] <sente> Web: usually its reasonable
[00:54:37] <Jeremiah_> Is this a lol channel?
[00:54:47] <Web> he started it ^-^
[00:55:49] <tfittsy> is there an obvious way to bind something using on() and have the selector be a parent?
[00:56:07] <Jeremiah_> Web.....Just stop it.......
[00:56:13] <Web> okay
[00:56:18] <tfittsy> right now I have $('.qi').parent().hover(function(),function());
[00:56:20] * Web backs out and sits quietly 
[00:56:43] <sente> tfittsy: not easier than that, that I know of
[00:56:50] <sente> tfittsy: I'm also hardly a pro,though
[00:56:56] <sente> if that works, what's wrong with it?
[00:57:03] <coldhead> are you using hover or on, tfittsy?
[00:57:05] <Web> so sente i have a project, are you interested ;) *WINKS*
[00:57:14] <sente> Web: no
[00:57:14] <tfittsy> coldhead, I'm using hover, I want to change it to on
[00:57:23] <Web> -______
[00:57:26] <tfittsy> because I'm loading data with ajax and don't want to rebind it every page load.
[00:57:43] <Web> tfittsy, seems tough hmm
[00:58:12] <GoddeR>  Hello, I am experencing an issue in FF9 where when I use jQuery Animate to change the opacity of a div it flickers. The div contains a flash object, which is overlayed on top of another div which contains a flash object. Let me know if you need any more information. Any help would be appreciated. [Related Code]: http://pastebin.com/ynczA7zD [Issue in FF9]: http://elidoruiz.com/pagepush.html
[00:58:17] <tfittsy> it works as a hover, but I'm about to have to move it to a function and call the function on every ajax page.  I'd rather use the new on method but I'm not sure how it works when you're binding to a selectors parent
[00:59:05] <coldhead> i don't understand, why don't you just select the parent directly in your selecor
[00:59:08] <coldhead> selector*
[00:59:13] <coldhead> if that's what you want to work with
[00:59:57] <coldhead> ?:has
[00:59:58] <bot-t> :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[01:00:37] <coldhead> $('div:has(.qi)').on('hover', ...
[01:01:13] <tfittsy> coldhead: I'll go with your first idea and just rewrite some code so I can select the parent
[01:01:16] <Web> wow you jquery pros <3

[01:16:01] <Zauberfisch> is there a way to make :empty ignore \s ?
[01:16:21] <Zauberfisch> i have <ul>   </ul> which I want to match with $('ul:empty')
[01:16:32] <Zauberfisch> but since there are some spaces it does not match
[01:17:11] <Zauberfisch> I found http://stackoverflow.com/a/744158/1119263 but thats not working with jquery.entwine
[01:20:21] <coldhead> i think you will
[01:20:44] <coldhead> Zauberfisch: i think you will need to use ?filter
[01:20:44] <bot-t> Zauberfisch, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[01:21:38] <GoddeR> ?eval ++[[]][+[]]+[+[]]
[01:21:39] <bot-t> GoddeR: "10"
[01:23:07] <Zauberfisch> coldhead thanks, but I think .filter() doesn't work with entwine eighter
[01:23:24] <Zauberfisch> awww, entwine is awesum, but this sucks :/
[01:29:55] <coldhead> Zauberfisch: you can define a custom pseudoselector
[01:30:06] <coldhead> that works like :empty except does what you need
[01:30:12] <coldhead> would that work?
[01:30:38] <Zauberfisch> hmmm, not sure, I am quiet new to entwine, the :has() selector for example does not work.
[01:31:01] <Zauberfisch> but thanks for the tip, I will try it
[01:31:07] <coldhead> oh no
[01:31:19] <coldhead> this is the first i have heard of entwine
[01:31:22] <coldhead> it sounds awful
[01:31:36] <Zauberfisch> hmm?
[01:31:45] <Zauberfisch> no, entwine is awesome
[01:31:50] <Zauberfisch> I really like it
[01:31:57] <coldhead> it's not awesome if it breaks jquery
[01:31:58] <Zauberfisch> but yeah, that selector thing sucks
[01:32:10] <Zauberfisch> https://github.com/hafriedlander/jquery.entwine
[01:34:32] <coldhead> weird
[01:36:20] <Zauberfisch> I thought the same when I first saw it
[01:36:49] <Zauberfisch> but now that I tried it, I wouldn't make another project without it :D
[01:37:02] <coldhead> strong words!
[01:37:11] <coldhead> i will have a look on company time tomorrow
[01:39:59] <Zauberfisch> but well, please note I am not that much of an javascript expert
[01:40:06] <Zauberfisch> more in php
[01:42:30] <Zauberfisch> ok, i found a way to work around my :empty thing by just hooking into some other functions that remove and add children
[01:42:37] <Zauberfisch> not ideal i think, but it works
[01:42:56] <Zauberfisch> but I will check out making my own pseudo selector later
[01:43:00] <Zauberfisch> just to try it
[01:45:17] <GoddeR> that dude was a genius
[01:45:58] <GoddeR> it seems animating the relative container while animating a childs position is absolute can cause flickering in ff O:
[01:46:04] <Zauberfisch> coldhead you mind telling me what you think of it once you found time to look at it?
[01:55:51] <coldhead> Zauberfisch: i will try to think of something interesting to tell you about it
[01:56:40] <GoddeR> i solved the issue! i should never doubt the almight wisdom of #jquery
[01:56:44] <GoddeR> :)
[01:57:15] <coldhead> good job, GoddeR
[02:00:10] <Zauberfisch> coldhead thanks
[02:06:49] <LearnerJq> is jquery official website in drupal?
[02:07:51] <_zoggy_> wordpress i thought
[02:08:44] <LearnerJq> no seems to be drupal
[02:10:22] <GoddeR> joomla!
[02:45:13] <geoid> I have this: http://pastie.org/3147832
[02:45:14] <geoid> Why is my [name] always the last value in my actions array when passed into my event listener?
[02:45:14] <geoid> like this, it works, but then I can't pass my second argument to the listener: http://pastie.org/3147843
[02:53:56] <geoid> Here's my problem illustrated in jsfiddle - so you can fiddle :) http://jsfiddle.net/kySjY/

[03:03:32] <GoddeR> mine is better
[03:03:33] <GoddeR> :D
[03:04:58] <geoid> Anime thx.. that makes sense, use the DOM :)
[03:05:08] <GoddeR> nooo
[03:05:12] <GoddeR> should use closure
[03:05:13] <geoid> GoddeR it works, but I don't know that I understand your code :-/
[03:05:26] <GoddeR> basically the name value is being overwritten every loop
[03:05:45] <geoid> ya, figured as much, but .. er.. um..
[03:05:51] <GoddeR> so you store it in anonymous
[03:05:54] <GoddeR> function
[03:06:14] <GoddeR>  then you have the anonymous functioner return the handler function that references the stored value
[03:06:25] <GoddeR> since a new anonymous function is created on every loop
[03:07:07] <geoid> v clever, but I'm a bit lost... what exactly does returning a function do? Does it execute it?
[03:07:40] <GoddeR> so
[03:07:53] <geoid> why is it wrapped in brackets?
[03:08:02] <GoddeR> (function () {})() executes a function immediately
[03:08:05] <GoddeR> without giving it a name
[03:08:14] <geoid> ok I c
[03:08:19] <GoddeR> so imagine you have a function
[03:08:23] <GoddeR> that returns
[03:08:26] <GoddeR> a function
[03:08:38] <geoid> which is what then get's executed when you click
[03:08:51] <geoid> ok. So why do you call this "closure"?
[03:08:52] <GoddeR> (function (n) {       })(name);
[03:09:04] <GoddeR> when you do that
[03:09:10] <GoddeR> you are passing the value of name
[03:09:13] <GoddeR> to the function
[03:09:28] <GoddeR> anything within that function can get the value by n
[03:09:37] <GoddeR> so
[03:09:49] <GoddeR> (function (n) {  console.log(n);     })(name);
[03:09:55] <GoddeR> would show the name
[03:10:19] <GoddeR> next you want to get the jquery click a function to call when someone clicks
[03:10:42] <GoddeR> (function (n) {  return function (e) {}     })(name);
[03:11:02] <GoddeR> within that function you would like to call the doIt function
[03:11:15] <GoddeR> (function (n) {  return function (e) {doIt(e,n);}     })(name);
[03:11:38] <GoddeR> now because its wrapped within a annonymous function
[03:11:49] <GoddeR> its references to n is stored with that function
[03:12:01] <geoid> I get it! :D   But what if you've previously set a variable called "n"   will the function (n)  get confused?
[03:12:26] <GoddeR> no it check local vars before global
[03:12:38] <GoddeR> so you could call it name if you wanted
[03:12:50] <GoddeR> (function (name) {  return function (e) {doIt(e,name);}     })(name);
[03:12:59] <GoddeR> but thats confusing
[03:13:02] <GoddeR> :P
[03:13:09] <geoid> awsome... this is a new trick for my magician's hat.
[03:15:12] * coldhead puts on your robe and wizard hat

[03:27:38] <GoddeR> I would go back to sleep to sovle your problem
[03:27:39] <walid> what's wrong here?? i'm trying to accomplish some kind of stamp effect
[03:28:12] <walid> GoddeR: i wish life was made of choices
[03:28:23] <walid> with no consequences
[03:28:26] <walid> :D
[03:29:01] <walid> but more seriously, i can't even get the dom loaded in jquery. what's wrong? i called it via $('#myid')
[03:29:08] <walid> has this changed overnight? :D
[03:31:34] <GoddeR> Your page-title div
[03:31:42] <GoddeR> is in front of your stamp div
[03:31:47] <GoddeR> in chrome
[03:32:45] <walid> oh.
[03:32:46] <walid> right.
[03:32:50] <walid> makes sense.
[03:32:52] <walid> thanks
[03:32:53] <walid> :)
[03:33:02] <GoddeR> you have firebug?
[03:34:49] <walid> GoddeR: i use the chrome dev tool, i like it better for my use
[03:47:47] <walid> i'm trying to create this stamp effect, that i need to be able to activate on demand
[03:47:49] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/gygCZ/5/
[03:48:31] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/gygCZ/
[03:48:52] <walid> the way i did the anim is either via css-transition or css-animation
[03:49:52] <walid> to 're'activate the animation, i need to removeClass, and then addClass. however, if i do this in 1 go, it won't work. i tried introducing a delay between removing and adding class, but no luck there..
[03:52:51] <walid> any help appreciated ;)
[03:53:20] <GoddeR> add a class that sets it to what you want it to do
[03:53:27] <GoddeR> then remove the old class
[03:53:43] <GoddeR> should have animate in class
[03:53:45] <GoddeR> animate out class
[03:53:50] <GoddeR> default class
[03:54:01] <GoddeR> well thats would i was working with css transitions
[03:54:14] <GoddeR> thats how**
[03:54:58] <walid> GoddeR: that's what i do, but imagine i want to run the anim again. then i do removeClass('anim').addClass('anim')
[03:55:06] <walid> not working.
[03:55:14] <walid> i have a transition version here: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/LZsGH/1/
[03:55:17] <GoddeR> add a class to animate in
[03:55:34] <GoddeR> then add a class that overrides the animate in class to be the next state
[03:55:48] <GoddeR> then remove both classes and use the animate in again
[03:55:49] <GoddeR> :O
[03:56:16] <GoddeR> but i suck at css maybe thats the wrong way
[03:57:09] <walid> and this is an animation-only version:
[03:57:10] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/gygCZ/
[03:59:36] <walid> GoddeR: hm. that seems wrong, but what i'm doing seems wrong as well. I feel like delay() is not working, though..
[03:59:52] <walid> i should see the class disappear for 1 sec, right??
[04:00:27] <GoddeR> not sure its 7 am here I havnt slept
[04:00:30] <GoddeR> I'm going to pass out
[04:00:32] <GoddeR> later

[05:17:26] <walid> hi guys
[05:17:41] <walid> i get this werid thing. i have a div id'd: backalamaisonhomegoing
[05:17:52] <walid> when i do $('#backalamaisonhomegoing').hide()
[05:18:10] <walid> it doesn't hide it. however, the console outs the div, WITH display:none
[05:18:19] <walid> try it: http://moijconnais.com
[05:20:48] <walid> the var i get to use as id is used in many other ways, successfully, but apparently just this one div seems immune to changes!
[05:21:08] <walid> but no one is around today :(
[05:28:24] <randoms> hi, i have an array of currency rates (from $.getJSON), what is the best way to find an element with a specific name if i dont know the index?
[05:32:04] <astropirate> randoms: indexOf
[05:32:21] <astropirate> array.indexOf('name')
[05:32:53] <astropirate> ohh you asked in #javascript <_<
[05:39:17] <walid> would someone mind running this code on that page, and tell me why it's not working?
[05:39:19] <walid> $jq('#backalamaisonhomegoing').hide()
[05:39:23] <walid> try it: http://moijconnais.com
[05:40:13] <walid> the div id='backalamaisonhomegoing' does exist, but it's not reacting to any jquery command! :( (similar/brother divs work just fine)
[05:41:56] <Wizek> Hey! What do you guys think about this: http://jsfiddle.net/KeREY/ ? What do you like/dislike about it? Tree.js is a fresh new unit testing framework. I'd love to hear your feedback on it!
[05:44:49] <StPiere> is there some method to wrap element in other element, like $(<el>).wrap() .. ?
[05:45:22] <StPiere> or $(<el>).wrap('<div class="wrapper"/>')
[05:45:48] <walid> ?wrapAll
[05:45:49] <bot-t> .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[05:45:57] <walid> ?wrap

[05:48:23] <walid> apparently some of my divs don't accept modification through addClass(), hide(), etc.. the selector is fine, i logged it and it returns the right object. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? it's like the divs are locked or smth.
[05:48:45] <walid> anyone experienced that before? or care to take a look?
[06:12:11] <Rayden[MODx]> why does this gets called twice?

[06:15:36] <astropirate> Rayden[MODx]: maybe your are calling the ajax function multiple times?
[06:16:23] <astropirate> and thats not a smart-ass answere :)

[07:06:21] <Patabugen> Hey, I'm just starting to use .on(), am I right in thinking that it's meant to work for objects created after my code to do the binding?
[07:06:45] <Anime> make a fiddle with it nvee

[07:07:56] <Patabugen> e.g $('.some_selector').on('click', function) followed by a $('<div class="some_selector"></div>').appendto(body) will work?
[07:08:28] <Anime> dreamstar: http://jsfiddle.net/rjmEA/2/ you could do this if the divs to be shown are to be strictly placed after what you click
[07:08:55] <Dreamstar> Anime: Nice

[08:11:39] <nmee> DatePicker options, sorry
[08:15:13] <kborchers> ?ui.datepicker @ nmee
[08:15:14] <bot-t> nmee, The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[08:15:24] <kborchers> Look at the option method
[08:22:08] <nmee> kborchers: ah, got it now! thanks :)
[08:22:17] <kborchers> np
[08:23:28] <MoTiOnXml> is there a function in jQuery to check if a value exists in an array?
[08:23:55] <MoTiOnXml> like ["page"].jQueryMethodHere("page") ?!
[08:28:13] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=JQuery+inarray
[08:29:16] <sunscreen> hrm
[08:29:54] <sunscreen> is there something wrong with jq 1.8.16's  on('click','function {}..') ?
[08:30:44] <sunscreen> i have it set on one of my divs and it triggers on page load
[08:30:52] <kborchers> sunscreen: 1.8.16 is jQuery UI. .on is jQuery 1.7+
[08:31:11] <sunscreen> er yea 1.7.1 one
[08:31:39] <kborchers> function doesn't go in quotes
[08:32:04] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: thanks \o
[08:32:25] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: what I ment was a function that returns a bool
[08:32:41] <sunscreen> $('#dashoption1').on('click', handlepannelcfg());
[08:32:53] <sunscreen> is what i actually have kborchers
[08:33:28] <kborchers> sunscreen: handlepannelcfg ... No parens
[08:34:27] <sunscreen> ah
[08:34:30] <sunscreen> thnx kborchers
[08:34:57] <reecefowell> why does this not work? $('form input:text[id="Profile_avatar"]').prop("disabled", false);
[08:35:02] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: Like the docs say, just check >= 0 for existence
[08:35:18] <kborchers> sunscreen: np
[08:36:10] <reecefowell> anyone can tell me please how to make this work?
[08:36:11] <reecefowell> $('form input:text[id="Profile_avatar"]').prop("disabled", false);
[08:40:44] <kborchers> reecefowell: $("#Profile_avatar").prop("disabled", false);
[08:41:08] <reecefowell> kborchers: i cannot use that because there are 2 fields with the same ID
[08:41:26] <reecefowell> the form is generated by a framework so there is nothing i can do about the 2 matching IDs
[08:41:27] <kborchers> that is invalid. don't do that
[08:41:50] <reecefowell> there is the label and the text input, they match in ID
[08:43:05] <reecefowell> so <label id="Profile_avatar"><input type="text" id="Profile_avatar">
[08:43:23] <reecefowell> as this is done by the Symfony PHP framework i cannot change this
[08:43:39] <reecefowell> so how can i work around it?
[08:44:35] <kborchers> that is just so wrong ... you could do $("#Profile_avatar").children().eq(0).prop("disabled", false); I make no guarantees though since your markup is wrong. your best fix is don't use Symfony since that is just amazingly bad
[08:45:23] <reecefowell> kborchers: Symfony is the framework that powers my entire site, cannot simply not use it
[08:46:03] <reecefowell> and in spite of this set back it is still one of the best and currently most popular MVC frameworks out there for php
[08:47:23] <reecefowell> kborchers: as ID has to be unique, there are other fields, such as field name
[08:47:49] <reecefowell> again though they both have the same matching name value, but maybe JQS would not get hung up on that?
[08:48:28] <reecefowell> so <label name="Profile[avatar]"><input type="text" name="Profile[avatar]">
[08:48:49] <reecefowell> the name has the square brackets inside because thats just what symfony outputs
[08:48:55] <reecefowell> can we work with that?
[08:50:35] <kborchers> $("input[name='Profile[avatar]']")
[08:50:59] <reecefowell> i tried testing it like this, but nothing happens
[08:51:03] <Anime> it stops working with repeated ids
[08:51:09] <reecefowell> 	$('form input:text[id="Profile[avatar]"]').value = "hello"; OR $('form input:text[id="Profile[avatar]"]').text("hello");
[08:51:09] <Anime> if they're unique, that code is right
[08:51:31] <Anime> is already* right, in fact
[08:51:53] <reecefowell> Anime: so the 2 IDs are legit?
[08:52:10] <reecefowell> despite matching on form elements of label and input?
[08:52:27] <Anime> what do you mean on being legit?
[08:52:39] <reecefowell> its acceptable by standards
[08:52:47] <Anime> nope?
[08:52:52] <reecefowell> <label id="Profile_avatar"><input type="text" id="Profile_avatar">
[08:53:07] <Anime> ids are unique, period
[08:53:13] <reecefowell> ok
[08:53:20] <reecefowell> but they do have the name value also
[08:53:25] <reecefowell> again both match
[08:53:29] <reecefowell> but can we work with that?
[08:53:46] <Anime> name being repeated is ok
[08:54:01] <Anime> i guess...
[08:54:17] <reecefowell> something like $('form input:text[name="Profile[avatar]"]')..prop("disabled", true);
[08:54:50] <kborchers> i already told you how to select by name
[08:56:28] <reecefowell> kborchers: thanks
[08:56:31] <reecefowell> it works now :)
[08:58:53] <dizzyone> does anyone know how to do something similar in jquery mobile as .live('pageinit'), but one that works even when you load that page from URL

[09:30:21] <IWillNotChange> can someone point me in the right direction as to what to change in my two css's to get juts one submit button? lol http://justin.derp.us/
[09:35:32] <dogan> hello! if a variable have code inside that calls a function how can I run it?
[09:37:36] <radarig> you mean like var x = function(){...}; ?
[09:38:51] <dogan> not exactly. i have onlcik code of an element and I get it with .attr("onclick"). i want this code to run it but not with $(element).click()
[09:39:30] <radarig> Eh, ew.
[09:40:50] <sweetgrass> Hello. Anyone know if there's a jquery-tools channel?
[09:41:28] <radarig> dogan: sounds like you'd have to use eval() or $.globalEval() in that situation, but hopefully you don't have to...
[09:41:36] <Anime> you either call element.click() or define that function outside, place it inside .click and call it wherever you want
[09:47:40] <sweetgrass> I am trying to add a delay to a carousel as it;s currently moving on too fast. In the options for the plugin im using, there's no 'pause'
[09:48:20] <sweetgrass> the library I am using has an api that has pause but i cant work out how to get it to do what I need
[09:54:45] <cuppsy> I have an image, and I'
[09:55:06] <cuppsy> m using jQuery to add a div over top of it on hover (absaolutely) placed. When I hover though, the div blinks rapidly...?
[09:55:47] <cuppsy> Wait, nvm. I'm thinking it's because as soon as the div is created over top, I'm no longer techinically hovering... duh.
[10:01:29] <IWillNotChange> http://justin.derp.us/ any suggestions on how to fix the submit buttons ;)
[10:01:44] <dizzyone> whats wrong
[10:02:21] <IWillNotChange> There is two, because its pulling from two css's but I cant figure out what to edit in the first css to change it to the second.
[10:03:47] <IWillNotChange> It seems no matter what I change in firebug both still stay too, so I'm lost.
[10:04:26] <dizzyone> hmm one sec
[10:05:22] <IWillNotChange> http://justin.derp.us/mobile/jquery.mobile-1.0.min.css  // http://justin.derp.us/css/styles.css // are the conflicting css's.
[10:07:02] <dizzyone> well first of all, I think it's supposed to be a button
[10:07:04] <dizzyone> not an input
[10:07:08] <dizzyone> not sure if that makes a difference
[10:07:22] <dizzyone> <button type="submit"
[10:08:08] <IWillNotChange> Maybe, lets see.
[10:09:02] <IWillNotChange> input type="submit"
[10:09:13] <dizzyone> which one do you want to keep?
[10:09:21] <IWillNotChange> the little blue one.
[10:09:25] <dizzyone> oh wait I see
[10:09:33] <dizzyone> the little blue one just seems to be an image?
[10:09:42] <IWillNotChange> but the big one is also making the positioning of the little one wrong.
[10:09:44] <IWillNotChange> and yes,
[10:09:45] <klafka> so if i'm doing foo = $.each(bar,func) where bar is an object and I want foo to be an array how would I do that?
[10:10:04] <dizzyone> I would drop the little one, you're using jquery mobile, you're supposed to theme their buttons
[10:10:17] <dizzyone> just drop the background-image in css and theme the big button
[10:10:30] <dizzyone> don't know why it's doing that though
[10:10:36] <IWillNotChange> Alright.
[10:10:39] <klafka> it seems to auto associate what i'm returning iwth the previous key
[10:11:02] <sweetgrass> can someone help me get the right syntax for pausing my carousel for a specified length of time: http://pastie.org/3149735 the api is here:http://flowplayer.org/tools/documentation/scripting.html#api
[10:11:17] <dizzyone> use the theme roller IWillNotChange
[10:11:38] <IWillNotChange> I have been, it doesn't let me adjust postioning/size.
[10:11:43] <Soopaman> hola all
[10:12:06] <Soopaman> has anyone ever attempted to do container specific dimension scaling?
[10:12:35] <Soopaman> playing around the idea of scaling content and font sizes to fix a container with fixed dimensions
[10:12:53] <xarxer> Hello.. I have a container centered via margin:0px auto; and when I use slideToggle(300); it slides up and down in the center of the page. But when I use toggle('blind', 300); it moves to the left of the page just before it starts sliding up, and likewise it slides down in the left of the page before it moves to the center.. Why is that?
[10:15:36] <dizzyone> IWillNotChange
[10:15:45] <dizzyone> I don't know whats going on with your button, but just wrap it in a div
[10:15:47] <dizzyone> inside the form
[10:15:56] <dizzyone> and position the div absolute/relative
[10:16:09] <dizzyone> I find it strange though that the button they make is not the same as the input
[10:16:27] <dizzyone> I'm pretty sure doing <button> works better than doing an <input?
[10:16:53] <cuppsy> Anyone use the Mosaic plugin?
[10:17:15] <dizzyone> oh wait
[10:17:20] <IWillNotChange> Hah, I might just have to just take it out, because the javascripts are intefering with each other too..
[10:17:42] <IWillNotChange> would it be easier to just use frames, and make each frame pull different css/javascript? (would it work like that)
[10:18:09] <IWillNotChange> because clicking submit just messing with the countdown too.
[10:18:15] <IWillNotChange> messes*
[10:18:25] <dizzyone> iframe is very easy if you want to seperate things, don't know if it's a good idea though
[10:18:28] <dizzyone> just a beginner myself
[10:18:41] <dizzyone> remove the border
[10:18:45] <dizzyone> and nobody notices a difference
[10:18:56] <dizzyone> but still, don't know if its a good thing to do
[10:19:25] <IWillNotChange> well, I'm not sure how else to do it..because the way its set up, all hte javascripts and all the css's are messing with each other
[10:19:41] <dizzyone> if css is messing up, try to be more accurate
[10:19:45] <dizzyone> with your selector
[10:20:25] <dizzyone> instead of having say #myTitle {}, do it accurate like: div#mainPage h1#myTitle {}
[10:20:47] <sweetgrass> Hello! Anyone done anything with 'flow player' from jquery tools?
[10:22:34] <Anime> dizzy, there's no difference since ids are meant to be unique
[10:22:48] <Anime> unless those were classes or plain tags
[10:23:00] <dizzyone> true
[10:23:03] <dizzyone> but just saying though
[10:23:13] <dizzyone> I think theres another rule though
[10:23:26] <dizzyone> where if you have 2 css definitions
[10:23:28] <dizzyone> of an ID
[10:23:32] <dizzyone> the one that is the most accurate
[10:23:39] <dizzyone> has the most accurate selector*
[10:23:41] <dizzyone> receives priority
[10:23:54] <dizzyone> not 100% on that, but its good practice anyway
[10:23:57] <Anime> hm
[10:24:14] <IWillNotChange> Well i got rid of the smaller on using opacity: 0;, but its not helping with the size/postioning lol, i have no idea what to edit its all so pushed together.
[10:24:34] <dizzyone> IWillNotChange, the smaller one is just the backround-image you gave
[10:24:38] <dizzyone> remove it
[10:24:44] <dizzyone> stick the input into a div, and position the div
[10:24:54] <dizzyone> jquery mobile somehow makes the button around the damn input
[10:24:58] <dizzyone> not sure why
[10:25:15] <dizzyone> you can't position the input, because the button jquery made is its parent
[10:27:40] <IWillNotChange> but will it move depending on screen position?
[10:27:59] <dizzyone> if you want to you can, position:absolute
[10:28:05] <dizzyone> not sure what you mean
[10:28:20] <dizzyone> if the button isn't meant to be a form
[10:28:28] <dizzyone> like yours doesn't seem to be part of a form
[10:28:32] <dizzyone> use <a> buttons instead
[10:28:36] <dizzyone> they don't have this problem
[10:28:50] <dizzyone> they look and behave the same
[10:29:10] <dizzyone> but they put the jquery mobile button graphics INSIDE the a, not as its parent
[10:33:52] <IWillNotChange> it is part of the form, justin.derp.us/coming-soon.php
[10:39:23] <Matiasu> Hello guys
[10:39:38] <Matiasu> is it possible to specify the context of the handler in .keypress?
[10:39:54] <Matiasu> I would like to change the "this" variable within the handler/callback
[10:44:10] <IWillNotChange> dizzyone
[10:44:23] <IWillNotChange> is it safe to put an iframe in an iframe? lol
[10:45:58] <IWillNotChange> dzzzyone
[10:45:59] <IWillNotChange> lol
[10:54:45] <SparkOut> hello
[10:57:05] <Kvark> Guys how to set text of selected option of select? $("#mySelect option:selected").val("Test"); does not work it changes the value not text of option
[10:57:36] <IWillNotChange> dzzzyone
[10:57:37] <IWillNotChange> lol
[10:58:07] <IWillNotChange> stupid iframe won't get rid of the border >.>
[11:00:29] <madsara> Hey, quick question... I have node1.mydomain.com and node2.mydomain.com... Am I correct in my belief that I'm not able to call contents() on an iframe of node2 from something running on node1?
[11:01:19] <madsara> I know flash has a crossdomain.xml file to define crossdomain relationships, I'm curious if mydomain.com is sufficient to allow contents() to work, of if the hostname (node1 vs node2, etc) prevents it.
[11:05:42] <ravenzz> madsara no, you should allow the domain1 to access the 2nd
[11:07:11] <ravenzz> madsara https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Server-Side_Access_Control
[11:07:50] <cybersholt> i would download html5 boiler plate it has the crossdoamins.xml and a htaccess file that fixes the issue too
[11:10:17] <madsara> ravenzz:
[11:10:27] <madsara> ravenzz: How do I do that exactly?
[11:11:25] <cybersholt> madsara: seriously check out html5bp it would fix ya problem
[11:11:42] <IWillNotChange> ITS NO GOOD GUYS! lol >.> this sucks -_-
[11:11:45] <madsara> cybersholt: Ok... but crossdomain.xml appears to only be for flash, I'm more interested in javascript.
[11:11:49] <madsara> http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/crossdomain.xml/
[11:12:02] <cybersholt> yea thats in the htaccess
[11:12:17] <cybersholt> it allows cross domain requests and multi port too
[11:12:54] <nVee> hey guys. How can I create a function which uses jquery and have the function available outside of that particular script?
[11:12:59] <madsara> See, I'm working in Elgg, so knowing just the actual feature to enable is what I'd prefer.
[11:14:32] <SparkOut> I have a question about inserting a dom element, I am creating a div to insert where I need to attach a unique id. The element definitiion begins:
[11:14:35] <SparkOut> var newDiv = '<div class="data_container" id="data_container-'+newId+'" data-profile_seg="user_work" data-sort="'+String(newSort)+'" >\n';
[11:14:46] <SparkOut> and builds the rest of the div ok
[11:15:11] <SparkOut> then when I use appendTo to attach the new div to the parent it is created ok but
[11:15:32] <madsara> Looks like the htaccess trick is actually a mod_proxy cybersholt .
[11:15:40] <SparkOut> there is a whitespace between the id "data_container-" and the new id
[11:15:45] <madsara> I actually contemplated that earlier.
[11:15:57] <cybersholt> its the best solution for my situation
[11:15:59] <SparkOut> so the id looks like "data_container- 27" for instance
[11:16:12] <madsara> Yeah.
[11:16:26] <cybersholt> i not only had cross domain issues with subs but also with ssl and non ssl
[11:16:28] <SparkOut> that means when I want to retrieve the id, it breaks because of the whitespace.
[11:16:35] <cybersholt> it really saved me
[11:16:42] <SparkOut> replace does not help
[11:16:46] <SparkOut> any ideas?
[11:17:05] <cybersholt> + it comes with gzip and a few other helpful functions
[11:17:30] <madsara> Yeah, my issue was basically this... I had an iframe "widget" that I wanted to act upon when it finished it's work. I think the iframe is possibly going to have to go away and I include the stuff natively.
[11:18:04] <madsara> In the meantime, I'm doing a setinterval to wait 25 seconds before going to the next step. Not as nice, but it works.
[11:18:08] <cybersholt> yea thats the other way, have you tried doing it with an ajax request?
[11:18:37] <madsara> I can't really... it's a speedtest widget I wrote, so a single ajaxified request isn't going to cut it.
[11:18:46] <cybersholt> ahhh i see
[11:18:58] <cybersholt> yea thats a tricky one then
[11:19:32] <madsara> Yeah, unsure how much more work I'm going to put into engineering this differently, it's temp. as is.
[11:20:00] <cybersholt> might be a good time to hold off on it till u decide a better solution
[11:20:38] <madsara> I'm running a wireless network, unsure how many people have bad throughput, so I'm measuring it at login now.
[11:21:02] <madsara> Of course, people were just clicking past it, so I'm pseudo enforcing it now
[11:22:34] <cybersholt> cool i wrote a little speed test a while back might help ya http://demo1.x10.bz/speed/
[11:25:46] <madsara> Yeah, we're using a similar methodology, I'm doing image loads hooking into .load() and preventing image cache (same thing that speedtest.net appears to do based on pcaps).
[11:26:01] <madsara> You're calling a GET on a file.
[11:26:33] <nVee> hey guys, I need to have a 10 second delay between array itteration in a for loop
[11:26:33] <cybersholt> yeah with random data no cache
[11:26:35] <nVee> any help?
[11:26:57] <madsara> cybersholt: Yeah, absolutely.
[11:27:06] <cybersholt> :)
[11:27:31] <madsara> There's no mechanism to hook into bytes xferred so far in javascript is there?
[11:27:54] <madsara> Flash appears to have something to hook into bytes xferred so far, apparently (based on my disections)
[11:28:10] <cybersholt> i dont think so
[11:28:36] <madsara> Me neither. Should be doable in the upload post (the receiving PHP or whatever script should be able to count bytes).
[11:29:14] <Matiasu> is there any stable project with UI plugins? jqueryui doesn't seem that active
[11:29:26] <madsara> Actually, based off that, you could hook in via the PHP script to see how many bytes it's sent at various times.
[11:29:43] <cybersholt> yea
[11:29:43] <madsara> Really? I thought jqueryui was pretty active.
[11:29:53] <silverwind> Matiasu, if you ever find one, tell me.
[11:30:00] <cybersholt> any nodejs experts here?
[11:30:15] <silverwind> cybersholt, I would try the nodejs channel
[11:31:01] <cybersholt> yea probly so
[11:31:05] <Matiasu> silverwind, I have found the tooltip and validotr tools from http://flowplayer.org are pretty good but I also use some plugins from jqueryui, I just don't like having to use plugins from many different places
[11:31:48] <silverwind> Matiasu, jqueryui actually works if you don't like flexibility.
[11:32:00] <Matiasu> haha I usually like flexibility
[11:32:14] <silverwind> For example, I use it for admin sections...
[11:32:23] <silverwind> Where I don't care about the look
[11:36:00] <sweetgrass> can someone help me get the right syntax for pausing my carousel for a specified length of time: http://pastie.org/3149735 the api is here:http://flowplayer.org/tools/documentation/scripting.html#api
[11:36:15] <sweetgrass> sorry http://flowplayer.org/tools/documentation/scripting.html#api
[11:37:28] <Matiasu> alright! I will use http://flowplayer.org/tools/
[11:40:28] <Alex2000> does anyone know how I could create this menu in CSS/jQuery? http://i.imgur.com/d8Vgj.jpg <--- any examples or any suggestions?

[11:43:49] <IWillNotChange> google;)
[11:44:19] <IWillNotChange> Just make the menu's then add images to them.
[11:44:59] <IWillNotChange> something like #32 maybe.
[11:45:59] <IWillNotChange> http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/36-eye-catching-jquery-navigation-menus/
[11:46:01] <IWillNotChange> taht might be helpful too.
[11:49:23] <Matiasu> seriously, we need a official UI library with tons of... things u.u
[11:49:27] <Matiasu> an*
[11:50:07] <IWillNotChange> Google will find most of them for you. just a matter of looking.
[11:50:58] <Alex2000> IWillNotChange, There is spacing between the items
[11:51:26] <Alex2000> Its hard to explain, but if oyu look at the image i provided.. when you go to each item there won't be any spacing between then avigation and the menu item
[12:18:30] <mayhem93> $() can take HTMLElement as an argument ?
[12:30:13] <dabear> mayhem93: yep, it can take an htmlelement for sure
[12:30:49] <mayhem93> and if it's undefined, it doesn't do anything?
[12:32:36] <mayhem93> and another question, how do i set useCapture to false in $.on() ? (event bubbling)
[12:42:09] <IWillNotChange> I need like 30  seconds of someones time, anyone around?
[12:42:41] <shesek> IWillNotChange, just ask
[12:43:17] <IWillNotChange> kinda wanted to take it to a private chat, but http://justin.derp.us/ i just need to find a work around for that submit button.
[12:43:36] <IWillNotChange> its pulling from two css's.
[12:43:44] <IWillNotChange> i tried adding .ui-btn-inner {
[12:43:51] <IWillNotChange> display: none;
[12:44:06] <IWillNotChange> but, it still doesn't move the blue one back to place, nor keep it the right colours.

[12:44:16] <IWillNotChange> (is what its supposed to look like)
[12:45:19] <shiftins> i'm using the jsonp datatype in a request, and the content type response is text/plain..
[12:45:53] <shiftins> I'm getting a parsererror as a result
[12:46:36] <shiftins> is there any way to force jquery to parse the response as jquery regardless of the response headers for jsonp requests?
[12:46:43] <shiftins> lol.. to parse the response as json..
[12:47:13] <shesek> shiftins, last argument to $.get/post, or the dataType property for $.ajax
[12:48:23] <shiftins> dataType in $.ajax is jsonp or script for crossdomain..
[12:48:39] <cybersholt> you could always use php or something and set the right headers
[12:48:48] <shiftins> i'm setting it to jsonp.. it looks like this expects the response header to be something other than text/plain
[12:48:59] <shiftins> *the content type response header
[12:49:27] <cybersholt> should be something like this application/json
[12:49:47] <shiftins> yes, it should be application/json but it's not :D
[12:50:10] <cybersholt> u php or what ?
[12:50:44] <shiftins> i tried setting dataType = "jsonp text json" as it looks like you can do this..
[12:51:25] <shiftins> cybersholt: this is all client side..
[12:51:38] <shiftins> the api I'm hitting is php, but it's not mine
[12:51:50] <cybersholt> ahh got ya
[12:51:59] <shiftins> i've let them know they should inspect the accepts header, and if it's application/json the response content type should be application/json
[12:52:14] <cybersholt> good thinkin
[12:53:37] <cybersholt> hell i still get the occasional Resource interpreted as Other but transferred with MIME type undefined. with me forcing the headers
[12:53:38] <jrm2k6> hi all
[12:55:07] <shiftins> hi jrm2k6
[12:55:25] <cybersholt> hello jrm2k6

[13:13:19] <`Korvin> get hashtags from the URL
[13:13:23] <`Korvin> he doesn't need a plugin for that
[13:15:50] <mayhem93> hmmm...this is a bit wierd, if an element has some elements within it, then i overwrite them with $.html()
[13:16:02] <mayhem93> the elements that were there before are still in the DOM
[13:16:09] <mayhem93> cuz i get double events
[13:16:17] <mayhem93> triple, quadruple and so forth
[13:16:27] <mayhem93> for each $.html() i apply on it
[13:17:27] <mayhem93> there's an element in that big element which has an event attached, but after i overwrite the elements with $.html() the event somehow is stil there and so must be the element
[13:24:29] <`Korvin> how can I break out of "ant = setInterval(function() { }"

[13:33:04] <Krazylegz> Hi.
[13:39:28] <qom2> I want a div to fade out when a it's assigned fade class, the class is given dynamically based on some criterias. What should I be working with to "look" for if a div has a certain class on site render and "live"?
[13:42:01] <cybersholt> qom2 try $('#fade').each()
[13:42:11] <cybersholt> then apply whatever
[13:44:23] <qom2> I'll try that, thanks!
[13:45:01] <cybersholt> no problem
[13:45:50] <jrm2k6> It is possible to do $('#test').click(test()) instead of $('#test').click(function(){ test();}); ?
[13:46:08] <diamondbilliard> hey all

[13:46:37] <cybersholt> qom2 i pmed ya some code
[13:52:26] <diamondbilliard> anyone ever had that problem? when i inpect my target div, chrome dev tools tells me one height, but console.log (target.height()) gives me a value thats more than double
[13:53:04] <cybersholt> thats crazy
[13:53:43] <cybersholt> have u tried this tool for chrome ? http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/

[14:08:03] <rzen> So I have a simple script here: http://demo.wpstartbox.com/wp-content/themes/startbox-phlog/phlog.js that powers an animation over the thumbnails on this page here: http://demo.wpstartbox.com/phlog/
[14:08:26] <rzen> works beautifully but very randomly it will fail in webkit
[14:08:39] <rzen> refresh a few times, and all is fine
[14:08:53] <rzen> anyone have any insight?
[14:09:51] <rzen> when it fails, all the thumbnails look like http://demo.wpstartbox.com/phlog/
[14:09:54] <rzen> er, http://d.pr/9vfJ
[14:46:56] <cornfeed> this is just a snip of what is going on so i hope it is enough to troubleshoot. when i hit a delete button, it loops for how ever many boxes are below it. i know it has to do with the .each() structure but I am not sure what would be better. http://jsfiddle.net/5WDzg/1/

[15:05:42] <cybersholt> very nice
[15:06:02] <snover> madsara: you could have saved yourself a lot of time by just using easyxdm
[15:06:22] <madsara> Just got it working on my stuff,... so from node1.mydomain.com I have an iframe of node2.mydomain.com. With document.domain="mydomain.com" on node1 (also node2 in javascript, unsure if that's necessary)... but I can access via $('#iframeid').contents().text()
[15:06:44] <madsara> snover: Yeah, I got a suggestion earlier about html5boilerplate that got into how this works.
[15:07:09] <madsara> I'm modifying an existing system, unsure how easy or wise it is to inject boilerplate or other into it.
[15:07:29] <madsara> From scratch, I'd probably go your route.

[16:00:11] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/quran - how do I assign a SlideUp click function to [+] once its content has been displayed?
[16:01:42] <Patabugen> Krinkle: Thanks again for your suggestion of yesterday, I've ended up with a much nicer solutuon than I had before:)
[16:01:52] <Krinkle> Patabugen: Great :(
[16:01:55] <Krinkle> Great :) *
[16:01:57] <coldhead> can you just have one function bound to that element that shows or hides as required, muzone?
[16:02:04] <coldhead> slideToggle?
[16:03:43] <Krinkle> muzone: Use $(this).parent().children('ul') instead of $(".debate ul")
[16:03:56] <Krinkle> otherwise they all toggle instead of just the one you want
[16:04:54] <Krinkle> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/pKg8c/
[16:06:00] <muzone> nice!!
[16:06:02] <muzone> hold up
[16:07:03] <muzone> Krinkle: very cool - thanks man!
[16:07:11] <thebignoise> qom2: did you mean to use mootools
[16:07:22] <qom2> oh, nope
[16:07:26] <qom2> but I solved it :)
[16:07:37] <thebignoise> oh ok
[16:08:01] <Krinkle> muzone: example: http://jsfiddle.net/pKg8c/1/
[16:08:33] <whoever> i am having trouble with a listener , the id is correct because i copied and pasted it, but nothing happens when i click the button $("#showInstallHelpBtn").click(function(){alert("test");});
[16:08:40] <Krinkle> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/pKg8c/3/
[16:08:41] <whoever> can someone assist?
[16:09:00] <Krinkle> whoever: Please show us context in jsFiddle

[16:09:12] <Krinkle> -_-
[16:09:27] <whoever> Krinkle: what is jsfiddle
[16:10:12] <Krinkle> google it
[16:10:18] <muzone> Krinkle: gorgeous piece of code - thank you so much !!
[16:10:46] <thebignoise> you better add e.preventDefault(); ;)
[16:11:27] <Krinkle> thebignoise: guess what, /3/ added that :)

[16:12:32] <muzone> (its this mixtape my brother made before he died, since then he's become known as "your favorite producer's favorite producer" and what not.. who know, if you're into good music you might like it)
[16:12:33] <coldhead> that's a very nice set muzone
[16:12:36] <muzone> no guarantees though
[16:12:52] <coldhead> i don't usually go for that kind of music but it plays well
[16:13:06] <muzone> im glad coldhead
[16:13:07] <Krinkle> muzone: thx
[16:13:49] <muzone> the beginning is not my brother it's some artist interpretation.. but yeah lemme know if you want more
[16:14:03] <muzone> it's the least i can do for y'all
[16:16:52] <whoever> Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/LCnUp/1/
[16:17:59] <Krinkle> whoever: that JavaScript is executed before the page exists
[16:18:29] <Krinkle> <html><head><script>..</script></head><body><button id=".></button></html>
[16:18:38] <Krinkle> You need to wrap in jQuery(document).ready(
[16:19:25] <Krinkle> whoever: http://jsfiddle.net/LCnUp/2/
[16:21:35] <whoever> Krinkle: even if the only way the code and be execuded is with a button that is set in a nother script to document.ready()
[16:22:02] <Krinkle> whoever: I have no idea what you mean, can you rephrase ?
[16:22:09] <Krinkle> or show examples
[16:32:14] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/quran - how do I make the JS not scroll up to the top when [+] is clicked?
[16:36:55] <Krinkle> ?clone

[16:39:26] <muzone> Krinkle: for me you mean?
[16:39:54] <Krinkle> no
[16:40:01] <whoever> Krinkle: i have another file "init.js" that is wraped with document.ready()  and the function i just posed is in a seperate js file, and the only way the function in that second file can be called is if the document is ready , so do i need to wrap all js file that contain jquery in document.ready()  ?
[16:41:06] <Krinkle> whoever: No, the way I recommend you do it is as follows: Create your methods in an object oriented manner, and in the last file (or in the html file it self simply do jQuery( document ).ready( myApplication.start );
[16:42:54] <Krinkle> so myApplication.js might contain window.myApplication = { doStuff: function(){  }, somethingElse: function(){ .. } }; and in init.js you have myApplication.init = function(){   ./* can call other functions */ .. }; and then in index.html <script>jQuery(document).ready( myApplication.init );</script>
[16:43:11] <whoever> Krinkle: is myapplication a string ie: index.htm or is myapplication more like a reserverd word
[16:43:30] <Krinkle> a string
[16:43:35] <Krinkle> just like jQuery
[16:43:42] <BassPlaya> Hey guys, I'm using the overlay function on a site but my background doesn't show as it supposed to. Although when I work in a test environment it does show.. here's the link http://www.sagatactical.com
[16:45:02] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: What are we supposed to see ?
[16:45:30] <BassPlaya> an overlay popup window and that shows but it's the background that should mask out all the other stuff on the site that isn't visible
[16:45:43] <BassPlaya> thank you for inspecting Krinkle ;-)
[16:47:09] <sphinxxx> i always thought href works on <button>
[16:47:12] <sphinxxx> :\
[16:47:19] <Krinkle> sphinxxx: Nope
[16:47:40] <Krinkle> but since <button> is a freeform button you can put a <a> inside of it
[16:47:49] <sphinxxx> ah
[16:47:51] <Krinkle> of course make sure you remove the ugly default styling if you do so
[16:47:55] <sphinxxx> right
[16:48:07] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: I don't know, but this is not going well
[16:48:34] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: you can see the popup overlay, right?
[16:48:45] <Krinkle> I see "SAGA Tactical "For the Pleasure of Survival" 2012 Luxury Calendar now available!" and a close button, yes
[16:49:17] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: Where is the code that should make it work ?
[16:49:25] <Krinkle> there's a gazillion files loaded on that page
[16:49:35] <Krinkle> consider minification/combincation in production mode, but that's another talk.
[16:49:41] <sphinxxx> Krinkle, need to do something like width:100% and display blcok on the <a> ?
[16:49:48] <whoever> Krinkle: in my init.js, it is wrapped in document.ready, and it sets elements visible/ or not , and my second file contains all my functions, so do I want to  ad at the buttom of my function file  $(document.ready("init.js")) or am i understanding this wrong
[16:49:50] <sphinxxx> otherwise the outside of the button is still clickable, but doesnt go anywhere
[16:50:10] <BassPlaya> Krinkle:  I know, because I need to see which files are loaded and which not so before I minify everything to speed up I have to see them first ;-)
[16:50:35] <Krinkle> sphinxxx: no, just <button class="my-button"><a href="http://jquery.com">Click here</a></button> and in your CSS file ".my-button a { text-decoration: none; color: black; }"
[16:50:50] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: like I said, production mode. no probem.
[16:51:05] <Krinkle> whoever: yes very wrong
[16:51:51] <Krinkle> whoever: I think you better learn javascript before you advance further with jQuery. jQuery doesn't require learning JavaScript if you just do a couple of simple effects, but your situation sounds like you're building a more javascript-based thing.
[16:52:00] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: hold on for the working code
[16:52:40] <Krinkle> whoever: Learn how to create objects in JavaScript, how to create methods in methods and then create an "init" function that does everything with the functions of the other file, and pass that function by reference to jQuery(document).ready( .. )
[16:53:50] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: that page is making a request to 4 in existing font files every few minutes, you're aware of that ?
[16:53:54] <Kichael> I have a button, I added some funcationality to it using .on, and I'm returning false. Problem is, sometimes the button actually submits when clicked on it, sometimes it does the action, what could be going wrong?
[16:54:13] <Krinkle> Kichael: Why are you returning false ?
[16:54:24] <whoever> Krinkle: actuly no, i am just tring  to keep functions seperaate from page initialization
[16:54:27] <sphinxxx> Krinkle, exactly what i did, but only the text is linkable
[16:54:32] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: what do you mean every few minutes?
[16:54:33] <sphinxxx> the button space isn't
[16:54:57] <BassPlaya> I'm aware of the font files but that it requests them every few minutes.. not sure why that would be
[16:55:04] <Kichael> so that the button doesn't so a submit of the form
[16:55:09] <BassPlaya> maybe that is because there's a slideshow playing?
[16:55:21] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: GET http://www.sagatactical.com/sites/all/themes/mono74/type/EBGaramond-webfont.eot 404 (Not Found) GET http://www.sagatactical.com/sites/all/themes/mono74/type/EBGaramond-webfont.ttf 404 (Not Found) GET http://www.sagatactical.com/sites/all/themes/mono74/type/EBGaramond-webfont.svg 404 (Not Found) ; this is repeated several dozen times
[16:55:32] <Krinkle> There should be no need to request that more than once a page, but whatever.
[16:55:49] <BassPlaya> Oh..
[16:56:07] <Krinkle> whoever: that's good, so you've got a file with functions and a file with initialization. And you load them as 1: jquery, 2: your functions, 3: init
[16:56:12] <Krinkle> and init uses the functions from file 2
[16:56:13] <Krinkle> right ?
[16:56:24] <Krinkle> whoever: so 3 <script src> tags
[16:56:57] <whoever> Krinkle: correct
[16:57:12] <Krinkle> whoever: number 3 (init) should have 1 function then, and pass it by reference to jQuery(document).ready( .. ); the other file doesn't have to contain document ready or whatever, as those functions are only called (in)directly by your init function.
[16:59:11] <whoever> Krinkle: ok, thx will give it a shot
[17:02:29] <whoever> Krinkle: i had the order of the scripts wrong, its jquery, init, funcions
[17:02:38] <Krinkle> aha
[17:04:22] <whoever> Krinkle: so i should just load init after my functions and problem solved
[17:04:29] <Krinkle> whoever: try
[17:06:45] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: I've tackled the webfont thing that was always shown a not found error. Thanks for pointing that out!
[17:07:25] <Krinkle> ok :)
[17:10:24] <Kichael> Another thing, I'm using node = $(li).last().clone() and node now has two li's instead of just one, anyone know why that is?
[17:11:12] <Kichael> hmmm maybe not, maybe it's the way I
[17:11:15] <Kichael> 'm appending
[17:12:30] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: if I use (locally) this line: 	<script src="jquery.tools.min.js"></script> then it doesn't work, but if I use this one: 	<script src="http://cdn.jquerytools.org/1.2.6/full/jquery.tools.min.js"></script> it works. Although I have a copy in the same directory as my html file..
[17:13:37] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: That doesn't help me much, can't see that
[17:14:08] <Krinkle> BassPlaya: Are you sure they are the same version ? And no 404 error ?
[17:14:57] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: I understand. Well, flowplayer lets me put in that version what I need to make it even smaller. http://flowplayer.org/tools/download/index.html
[17:15:55] <Krinkle> I don't know flowplayer. Going back to my own project for a few minutes, if you need anything else please show concise examples, preferably in jsFiddle and dump it in the channel :)
[17:16:17] <BassPlaya> Krinkle: will do. Thanx a bunch already
[17:16:23] <Krinkle> oki :)
[17:17:27] <Kichael> okay I got it, why does it when I click on a button, it gets clicked twice, so the js gets executed twice? I'm using $("#add_goals").on('click', function() {
[17:22:47] <magnus___> Hello people! I have a small problem. I have built a validation script for the input fields of my form. It validates on blur. However, one of the input sometimes freaks out, removes characters in it's value and does on "blur", even though it hasnt been blured. I believe this is because the password-field below it tries to autocomplete the password (turned off). Anyone knows the solution to this problem?
[17:23:44] <Krinkle> magnus___: Can you show the problem in action ? (i.e. reproduce it at jsFiddle.net )
[17:24:28] <magnus___> I will try! thanks
[17:24:54] <aca20031> isnt there a name for that pseudo-disabled look where a pagei s covered with a grey overlay so you cant click on anything?
[17:25:08] <aca20031> ie i want to 'disable the page' while waiting on getJSON to return
[17:31:35] <Zackko> how can I check if an element is actually in the dom, like if it has ACTUALLY been appended somewhere and not just sitting in memeory?
[17:32:29] <coldhead> $('.something').closest('body').length > 0 ?
[17:33:20] <aca20031> nevermind btw, i found BlocKUI :)
[17:33:35] <zkirill> What's the difference between $(document).on("click", "a", ) and $("a").click(  ) ?
[17:34:50] <coldhead> zkirill: the click() form will only apply to elements already in the page
[17:35:03] <coldhead> .on will work for elements now and elements added later
[17:35:10] <zkirill> coldhead: brilliant, thanks mate
[17:35:42] <magnus___> it seems that my problem with the blurring input isnt reproducable @ jsFiddle :). I am pretty sure that it is the passwords problem tho, it flickers while the input above it is being blurred...
[17:36:46] <magnus___> actually, it seems that whenever I start typing in the field about the password, the entire field gets marked somehow.
[18:13:24] <gao> hello, adding jquery to my site makes it really slow to load the first time
[18:13:56] <gao> and it causes the rendering of my webpage to be delayed
[18:23:25] <cuppsy> Anyone know why FadeTo doesn't affect absolutely positioned items in IE7/8?
[18:28:15] <supermoose> Hi, can anyone suggest a rich text editor (plugin maybe) that doesnt show a text area but simply lets the user edit text on the page?
[18:33:00] <Patabugen> supermoose did you find your rich text editor?
[18:33:27] <supermoose> I found about contentEditable html5 property, seems interesting
[18:33:54] <Patabugen> Ah ok, I'm doing a similar thing but using WYMEditor and skinning it
[18:34:17] <Patabugen> Though it's harder to detach the toolbar than it is with TinyMCE
[18:34:38] <ndss56> what does MCE stand for?
[18:34:56] <ndss56> i assume something like ... code editor
[18:35:06] <Patabugen> I have no idea, though I did ponder
[18:35:16] <Patabugen> perhaps My Content Editor
[18:35:25] <Patabugen> or Tiny Mini Content Editor lol
[18:35:37] <Patabugen> Tiny Moxiecode Content Editor, says Wikipedia
[18:35:54] <aaroninfidel> in jQuery how can I create an element to manipulate then append it to the dom?
[18:35:55] <ndss56> what is Moxiecode? :D
[18:36:02] <Patabugen> Moxiecode being the company who develops it
[18:36:08] <Patabugen> Moxiecode Systems AB
[18:36:23] <ndss56> ah, all clear now :D
[18:36:37] <Patabugen> haha yep
[18:36:50] <gao> hello, adding jquery to my site makes it really slow to load the first time
[18:36:52] <gao> and it causes the rendering of my webpage to be delayed
[18:37:25] <y3di> $(document).on('click', '.post-button', function() {} -- is there a way I can get access to the .post-button element in my call back function?
[18:37:35] <Patabugen> gao You could try using the Google CDN (or another CDN) to host it, then your visitor will more likely have it cached, perhaps
[18:37:56] <onykage> what is the correct way to call jquery when using a dynamic id?
[18:37:58] <Patabugen> y3di does $(this) not give you it?
[18:38:28] <y3di> i actually didn't try. but i assumed itd give me the document object. but imma go try right now
[18:38:32] <gao> Patabugen: i am
[18:38:33] <y3di> its foolish to make assumptions
[18:38:37] <coldhead> gao: that shouldn't be happening, perhaps you are loading it or using it in some weird way?
[18:39:00] <gao> 	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[18:39:00] <gao> 	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[18:39:04] <onykage> i tried $("#dynamicid"+x).action() but it doesnt appear to be working
[18:39:14] <Patabugen> There's a page on the jQuery website which explains what $(this) is and when
[18:39:30] <coldhead> gao: so just including those two files, with no other jquery code, is slowing the site load?
[18:39:41] <coldhead> is it the same if you move those to the bottom of the page?
[18:39:49] <coldhead> they're supposed to load in the backgrond >: |
[18:39:58] <Patabugen> onykage By dynamic ID do you mean using a variable in the $()?
[18:39:59] <coldhead> while everything else continues >:|
[18:40:13] <y3di> Patabugen: yea sorry about that. You're right. Thanks
[18:40:15] <onykage> Patabugen: yessir
[18:40:36] <Patabugen> gao It might be worth using the Net tab of Firebug (in Firefox) to check that it is the JS being slow
[18:41:00] <Patabugen> onykage That is the correct way
[18:41:06] <gao> ahh thx coldhead it worked
[18:41:51] <coldhead> hooray!
[18:42:04] <onykage> Patabugen: let me go up a pastie then, cus something is a miss then
[18:42:24] <Patabugen> gao If moving it to the bottom worked (you shouldn't need it there) then perhaps the server's not configured correctly (i.e concurrent connections?)?
[18:44:55] <imsky> ?js "hello world"
[18:44:55] <onykage> Patabugen: http://www.pastie.org/3151995
[18:44:58] <bot-t> imsky: "hello world"
[18:45:03] <imsky> thank you
[18:46:04] <gao> it just starts rendering the page earlier
[18:46:46] <onykage> Patabugen: the vars that are inline work fine, the dynamic statement using val() does not, and the datepicker also is not called to the best of my knowledge
[18:46:53] <Patabugen> The jquery bit should be in the head, and it should be able to work there
[18:48:36] <Patabugen> onykage if you do console.log($("#sdate_"+x)) do you get your items listed?
[18:49:14] <onykage> let me try that, ive used alert to check the callback and it works perfectly
[18:51:13] <onykage> Patabugen: jQuery(input#sdate_1.datacell) is what the console returns
[18:52:14] <Patabugen> And that's the correct item?
[18:52:48] <onykage> i believe so, im not sure how to read the console notation like that, ive never used it like that before
[18:53:01] <onykage> datacell is the class for that input item
[18:53:06] <Patabugen> What browser are you using?
[18:53:15] <Patabugen> It's the same as CSS
[18:53:25] <Patabugen> it's an input with an ID of sdate_1 and a class of datacell right?
[18:53:26] <onykage> FF
[18:53:33] <onykage> yes
[18:53:36] <Patabugen> Using Firebug?
[18:53:43] <onykage> thats correcto
[18:53:45] <Patabugen> If you click on it, it'll take you to the HTML tab and highlight the item
[18:53:49] <onykage> yep
[18:53:52] <onykage> it does
[18:53:57] <Patabugen> It looks like it's working
[18:53:58] <onykage> but the value is null
[18:54:04] <Patabugen> What value?
[18:54:11] <Patabugen> which*
[18:54:12] <onykage> $("#sdate_"+x).val(val.sdate);
[18:54:26] <Patabugen> val.sdate is null?
[18:54:38] <onykage> not if i put it to the console or alert it no
[18:54:38] <Patabugen> or the return of val(val.sdate)?
[18:55:39] <onykage> it supposed to be setting the value which is returned from a json array
[18:55:59] <Patabugen> The problem isn't your selector
[18:56:18] <onykage> setting the value, formatting the date, and adding datepicker to that input id
[18:56:51] <onykage> well thats what i thought
[18:56:54] <onykage> but get this
[18:57:03] <onykage> if i set teh value inline like the rest of the fields
[18:57:08] <onykage> it works fine
[18:57:35] <Patabugen> howd you mean inline?
[18:57:48] <onykage> same with the datepicker, I just cant apply the setDate method using $(this)
[18:58:04] <onykage> you looking at the pastie?
[18:58:07] <Patabugen> yeah
[18:58:18] <onykage> look at line 12
[18:58:24] <onykage> the append statement
[18:58:46] <Patabugen> ooh I see
[18:59:07] <Patabugen> I'd create the element at the start of the loop and hang on to the regerence to it
[18:59:28] <onykage> you  know
[18:59:48] <onykage> when the answer is found i feel like a complete retard at times
[18:59:52] <onykage> thats exactly the problem
[18:59:52] <Patabugen> var newPicker = $('div...'); newPicker.appendTo() newPicker.dateThingie()
[19:00:04] <onykage> you cant apply the target because it doesnt exist yet
[19:00:32] <onykage> props Patabugen: ,uch appreciated
[19:00:36] <onykage> much*
[19:00:51] <Patabugen> nw, glad it's working :)
[19:01:21] <onykage> havnt tested it yet but im sure that was the problem
[19:01:31] <onykage> i knew it was something retorical
[19:08:39] <BassPlaya> hey guys, my mask is covering my overlay. can anyone have a look at what I'm doing wrong here? http://www.sagatactical.com/
[19:15:02] <brenbren23> I've got an absolutely positioned div floating on top of another div. I want the topmost div to always be visible (with a really high z-index), but I only want the bottom div to be clickable. I was wondering if there was some way to pass the top div's click event to the element below it? They are on completely different branches, node-wise, mind.
[19:21:03] <Patabugen> brenbren23 I don't know much about it, but the click event is meant to Bubble down I believe, so perhaps you could make the top one ignore it?
[19:21:39] <brenbren23> Patabugen: how can I do that?
[19:22:09] <Patabugen> No idea off hand ;) Checkout the docs for Click
[19:22:17] <brenbren23> i tried event.preventDefault and event.stopImmediatePropagation
[19:22:59] <Patabugen> that's further ahead than I've gone
[19:32:07] <Danny_B|backup> hi. i have <div id="foo"><div id="bar">(some dom content here)</div></div>. is it possible to duplicate the entire div and then change its (and its child) id (since id must be unique)? or is it necessary to create the clone manually?
[19:38:13] <brenbren23> Danny_B|backup: shot in the dark here, but the first thing i'd try:  var baz = $("#foo").clone(); baz.attr('id','newid1').children().first().attr('id','newid2');
[19:38:51] <brenbren23> Danny_B|backup: then you'd need to replace the old dom element with the new one. but this might be asinine. i'm a newb.
[19:41:49] <Danny_B|backup> the deal is that idk if the new element is created, if it is appended to dom on creation or after using stuff like appendchild etc. if the former, then cloning of elements with id (or having children with id) would produce invalid dom structure, i think
[19:42:13] <Danny_B|backup> s/if the new element/when the new element/
[19:42:22] <Zackko> does anyone know what channel is ckeditor?
[19:42:40] <Zackko> im using the jquery extension if anyone knows enough to help too
[19:43:25] <Danny_B|backup> Zackko: now channel matching the *ckedit* mask
[19:43:39] <Danny_B|backup> *no
[19:44:27] <Zackko> grrwell does anyone know enough to help me with ck via the jquery extension
[19:46:20] <simpleirc814> bzzz
[19:47:25] <brenbren23> Patabugen: found a really elegant solution with CSS... pointer-events:none; . :D:D:D
[19:48:30] <onykage_droid> is there an elegant way to import whole chuncks of xml without using sa template?
[19:52:02] <Zackko> ?
[19:52:15] <onykage_droid> ??
[19:53:17] <Patabugen> brenbren23 Excellent :)
[19:55:32] <onykage_droid> Patabugen: that was the problem.  cant reference something that has yet to be called.  wouldnt have seen that anytime soon if you haddnt mentioned it.  thanks bunches
[19:56:56] <Patabugen> onykage_droid Glad to hear it :)
[20:08:34] <rknLA> hey, so, i'm trying to implement a facebook-style autocomplete and i'm generating a div with a ul without any problems, but i have a function linked to the search field's blur event that deletes the div.. unfortunately, clicking in the div qualifies as a blur, so the li is getting remove()'d before the .click is getting propagated and according to what i've seen on stack overflow, i can't control the event binding order.  anyon
[20:08:35] <rknLA> any solution ideas?
[20:12:39] <onykage> rknLA: dont remove the div until after the even propogates
[20:12:50] <onykage> event*
[20:13:08] <rknLA> onykage: thanks.  how do i do that?
[20:13:18] <onykage> rknLA: jsut change your order of opperation
[20:13:34] <rknLA> onykage: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/290254/how-to-order-events-bound-with-jquery
[20:13:41] <rknLA> (tl;dr = you can't)
[20:14:08] <onykage> yes you can i do it all the time
[20:14:33] <rknLA> well it doesn't work with blur.  cause the click handler is declared before the blur handler
[20:14:34] <onykage> toss up a pastie and i'll point it out
[20:14:37] <coldhead> FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
[20:14:41] <rknLA> and i suspect it'll be browser dependent.
[20:14:46] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[20:14:58] <onykage> They'll keep on fighting, and they'll win
[20:15:04] <onykage> =)
[20:15:58] <rknLA> hope you don't mind coffeescript ;)
[20:15:58] <rknLA> https://gist.github.com/1581048
[20:16:29] <rknLA> shit, hold on,
[20:16:34] <onykage> which func is the one your using
[20:16:36] <rknLA> i cut the previous binding out of the file
[20:17:15] <rknLA> check again
[20:17:28] <markatto> e/bbret
[20:17:29] <rknLA> bindings are handled in the updateBindings function
[20:21:14] <onykage> ok correct me if Im wrong here.  what your doing is user clicks on fieldA to search for itemA which causes autocomplete and hides fieldA in the process
[20:22:31] <rknLA> slightly wrong.
[20:23:30] <rknLA> user clicks fieldA, user types, autocompletion pings the server, the response is an html snippet (ul inside a div), which gets appended to the DOM.  onBlur of fieldA deletes the snippet
[20:25:28] <onykage> ok i see your problem, your using an 'action' to trigger a timeout which removes items appended to the DOM
[20:25:52] <coldhead> you're*
[20:26:11] <onykage> your you're you are same difference
[20:26:37] <rknLA> no, the timeout is so that the server isn't hit for every character
[20:26:46] <rknLA> blur is removing the items appended to the DOM directly
[20:27:11] <rknLA> (unless people type slowly, but whatever)
[20:27:40] <rknLA> i think i might have an idea of how to solve this..
[20:28:02] <onykage> i know nothing of coffee but why dont you use the autocomplete package that comes inside the jquery ui? it has a setting for that
[20:28:30] <rknLA> combination of laziness (ha) and discontent with how it looks
[20:30:27] <rknLA> oh, it's customizable.. go figure
[20:30:34] <onykage> aye
[20:30:45] <onykage> you can theme anything in the ui
[20:30:57] <onykage> or plugin your own css
[20:32:03] <rknLA> ok ok, convinced.
[20:32:06] <onykage> i dunno mate, i dont know anything about coffee so i dont know if you have a oopsie there or not, but it sounds like from what your describing that you have your events triggering out of order
[20:32:51] <rknLA> coffee is basically just a javascript abstraction layer, sort of like haml
[20:33:08] <rknLA> i'm pretty sure it's events out of order, cause if i remove the deselected binding, it works
[20:33:16] <rknLA> (works being my breakpoint gets hit)
[20:33:26] <rknLA> s/being/meaning
[20:33:42] <onykage> aye .. the markup is still greek to me tho =/
[20:35:05] <rknLA> i suppose i could paste the javascript output ;)
[20:45:06] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[20:45:06] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus hangin n chillin
[20:45:13] <coldhead> cool babe
[20:48:07] <rknLA> hmm, so the other part of this that's kindof tricky/annoying: the input field can be created multiple times on the same page, which is why i  had all that unbind bind crap in the code
[20:48:58] <rknLA> (i.e. the autocomplete is for a person's name, and the user can add more people, which are identical rows in a table, each one having an input field.
[20:48:59] <rknLA> )
[20:49:01] <coldhead> sounds like a good use case for on()/off()
[20:51:03] <rknLA> can you on()/off() .autocomplete?
[20:53:36] <tomw_> What's the most succint alternative to empty(), but which retains event bindings. I want to remove all the children of an element, but keep the all the event bindings on those children. So far the best I've got is $(something).children().detach(). I'm wondering if I could do $(something).deatch(<some selector>) which would achieve the same result?
[20:54:26] <tomw_> It's padantic I know, but I want to get a solution as close to empty() as possible.
[20:54:54] <rknLA> why are you keeping event bindings to elements that no longer exist?
[20:55:27] <coldhead> pedantic*
[20:55:47] <tomw_> Because they'll be re-insert into the DOM about two lines down from where the parent is emptied.
[20:56:01] <rknLA> o_O?
[20:56:25] <tomw_> I'm basically emptying a dom element, then repopulating it with new elements. Some of those elements may have previously been children, and thus I don't want to remove their behaviours.
[20:57:25] <rknLA> interesting approach
[20:58:27] <tomw_> It's part of a render() method in a Backbone.js view.
[20:58:52] <rknLA> aah
[20:58:58] <coldhead> i would control the behaviours generically with on() and use data() to get the relevant info per element
[20:59:07] <rknLA> what about parent.text('')
[20:59:13] <rknLA> or parent.html('')
[20:59:26] <coldhead> few function, many data, instead of many functions, many datas
[21:00:43] <tomw_> parent.html('') and parent.text('') seem to have the same behaviour as empty()
[21:00:56] <khurram> hello
[21:02:04] <tomw_> coldhead: Using jQuery methods like on() isn't an option. The framework I'm using, backbone.js, uses delegate() to auto-bind events, thus I need a solution that works with that.
[21:02:12] <khurram> i am debugging a javascript application and  when i console.log( arguments ) i get Object Object  can some one please tell me how to further go into Object Object
[21:03:42] <coldhead> it's a shame tbranyen isn't around to advise you, tomw_, that guy knows all about such things
[21:08:56] <dr0id> is .on() used in favour of .event() and .delegate() these days pretty much ?
[21:09:17] <tomw_> khurram: If you're using firebug, it'll allow you to drill down into the object returned by console.log(). Other debuggers may not offer this functionality.

[21:11:49] <muzone> nevermind i got this
[21:12:33] <khurram> coldhead: you are NO. 1
[21:12:42] <coldhead> no one indeed
[21:12:56] <dr0id> cool
[21:13:24] <dr0id> I use .on() but was wondering whether people are replacing events like .click() with .on('click'...) too or not

[21:17:09] <dr0id> Yapsee: I am not interested.
[21:18:50] <coldhead> thanks for stopping by, Yapsee
[21:19:03] <coldhead> bot-t: tell Yapsee GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR STACK!!1
[21:19:04] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:19:08] <coldhead> bot-t: thanks

[21:38:32] <rknLA> ok, so, now how do i debug jquery ui autocomplete?
[21:38:38] <rknLA> the server appears to be rendering json
[21:40:58] <rknLA> (it is, i can curl it and get the proper result.. it's just not rendering to the html)
[21:47:15] <Matiasu_> why .val() doesn't work for checkboxs? it always returns the useless value of 'on'!
[21:48:08] <Matiasu_> I know I can use checkbox[0].checked, but I needed a standard way to get input's value. I will have to add a bifurcation based on the type now :|
[21:52:31] <Matiasu_> ahh, I got it! the "value" of a checkbox is the attribute "value", no if it's checked or not!
[21:52:49] <rknLA> so, can i modify two input fields from one autocomplete?  i.e. modify a hidden field in addition to the text field?
[21:53:23] <coldhead> ?:checked
[21:53:23] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[21:53:31] <coldhead> ?:czech
[21:53:35] <bot-t> coldhead, #3072 ([validate] czech localization)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3072
[22:05:32] <Matiasu_> is there a way to attach a handler to two events but execute just one of them (the first one triggered, the second one shouldn't be executed)?
[22:06:50] <nVee> I need to set a pause interval between iterations of a for loop. In short, in the example I have attached a new banner needs to show for 10 seconds, then after that, it can go to the next loop and have the same happen. Anyone keen to help? http://jsfiddle.net/tkwch/
[22:07:42] <cornfeed> i just finished this code, it works the way i want it, but I feel like it could be a bit cleaner. for example, by .extend function has to use jQuery, is there a way i can remove that? etc
[22:07:46] <cornfeed> http://jsfiddle.net/xkL5m/
[22:11:15] <coldhead> cornfeed: extend() works well and is widespread, i wouldn't worry about that
[22:12:11] <coldhead> cornfeed: what you might like to do is cache your selectors better
[22:12:36] <coldhead> so instead of jQuery(el).whatever() you do var $el = jQuery(el); and then $el.whatever()
[22:12:49] <coldhead> ditto for var $this = jQuery(this);
[22:12:54] <aple> Does anyone know if there is a nice plugin that filters results with checkboxes (similar to Magento's layered nav)? I found this tut (http://askthecssguy.com/articles/checkbox-filters-with-jquery/) but the author openly admits it's not a good solution, so I was just wondering if there was something really nice already out there.
[22:20:47] <aple> Bleh, I'll make one from scratch. Doesn't look that hard.
[22:21:09] <coldhead> good luck aple!
[22:21:12] <coldhead> hope it goes great
[22:24:14] <cornfeed> coldhead: yeah i know that, but i have no clue how to do that
[22:24:18] <nVee> I need to set a pause interval between iterations of a for loop. In short, in the example I have attached a new banner needs to show for 10 seconds, then after that, it can go to the next loop and have the same happen. Anyone keen to help? http://jsfiddle.net/tkwch/

[22:40:21] <han_shot_first> nvm, found a guide!
[22:43:57] <nVee> I need to set a pause interval between iterations of a for loop. In short, in the example I have attached a new banner needs to show for 10 seconds, then after that, it can go to the next loop and have the same happen. Anyone keen to help? http://jsfiddle.net/tkwch/
[22:44:27] <rknLA> so, is jquery unfriendly to $('#idsWith[arrays]')?  i can't seem to get it to return a value even though the id matches
[22:44:49] <coldhead> you need \s, rknLA
[22:44:54] <coldhead> some number of \s
[22:44:59] <coldhead> \\s even, sometimes
[22:45:07] <rknLA> ah, got it
[22:45:21] <GoddeR> \\\\s
[22:45:33] <nVee> can you use jquery .delay() to pause iterations in a for loop?
[22:46:21] <GoddeR> ahhhhhh
[22:46:23] <GoddeR> O:
[22:46:50] <nVee> can you use jquery .delay() to pause iterations in a for loop?
[22:47:04] <coldhead> don't use a for loop, nVee
[22:47:07] <coldhead> use recursion
[22:48:05] <nVee> coldhead: I am really having a tough time to get my script working
[22:49:11] <nVee> It works, but not the way it should. In short, a) I get a json array with banners from the db, b) I currently run a for loop to iterate between them and then c) I need to show a banner, and 10 seconds later, take it off and replace it with a new one (go to the next iteration in the loop)
[22:49:23] <nVee> currently it only shows the last banner
[22:49:47] <nVee> here is my script: http://jsfiddle.net/tkwch/
[22:49:52] <coldhead> nVee: for loops are not good for this kind of thing
[22:49:55] <coldhead> recursion is very good
[22:50:01] <coldhead> look at this convenience: http://jsfiddle.net/Hj9Rk/
[22:50:14] <coldhead> you'll see "thing!" appear 5 times in your console
[22:50:16] <nVee> I'm sure im screwing it up with logic :)
[22:50:19] <coldhead> at an interval of 1 second
[22:50:27] <coldhead> yes, using for is making your life difficult
[22:52:03] <nVee> hmm
[22:52:06] <nVee> let me try that quick\
[22:52:07] <nVee> brb
[22:52:07] <nVee> :)
[22:52:38] <coldhead> good luck babe!
[22:53:09] <aple> You guys are Chrome fans right? Is there any way to get Inspector to update it's view as the page changes? For instance, if I addClass "bar" to #foo, how do I get Inspector to show that change (live)?
[22:54:53] <coldhead> my inspector does that already, aple
[22:55:12] <aple> Well........ crap.
[22:55:15] <aple> Mine doesn't.
[22:55:25] <aple> Trade ya?
[22:56:54] <coldhead> which chrome are you using?
[22:57:12] <aple> I dunno, Chrome on Win7
[22:57:23] <coldhead> that should be good in the hood
[22:57:26] <coldhead> i'm on an old version
[22:57:28] <coldhead> 18.0.996.0 (Developer Build 116287 Linux) Ubuntu 10.04
[22:57:34] <coldhead> and all is well
[22:57:46] <aple> 16.0.912.75 m
[22:58:01] <coldhead> ack
[22:58:06] <coldhead> doesn't it autoupdate?
[22:58:16] <aple> I dunno, I haven't told it not to :(
[22:58:39] <coldhead> try using the latest from the developer channel
[22:58:55] <coldhead> http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
[22:59:16] <aple> Hm, actually, I think I turned "Google Update" off in my startup apps. :)
[22:59:19] <aple> Maybe that broke it.
[23:00:51] <aple> 17.0 now
[23:02:34] <aple> Eh, still not able to see that change in Inspector.
[23:05:55] <dov23> Hi, I am having a strange problem.  I have some jQuery code http://pastebin.com/AWepxTx5 .  For some reason, my editClickAction() never gets bound.  Am I doing something wrong here?
[23:06:25] <lc3> word
[23:06:48] <dr0id> letter
[23:07:09] <lc3> so like, if i have a page "/questions/", i do a jQuery.ajax request to "/questions/ask/ajax/", is that considered cross-origin and therefore forbidden?
[23:07:38] <lc3> the awesome part: it works locally (127.0.0.1) in chromium, doesn't work in any other browser, doesn't work on chromium on the live site
[23:09:25] <_ikke_> lc3: cross-origin only applies to things like hostname, protocol and port
[23:09:33] <_ikke_> s/hostname/domain/
[23:10:15] <lc3> _ikke_: okay, that's what i thought
[23:12:58] <lc3> so okay, there's jquery ajax code on /questions/, which is meant to post to /questions/ask/ajax/, it doesn't, but i fired up wireshark and i did notice chromium randomly making another request to /questions/
[23:13:06] <lc3> so, i don't even
[23:14:35] <lc3> also watching wireshark, firefox is actually doing nothing
[23:14:39] <lc3> :/
[23:15:00] <aple> coldhead: lol, nm, works, my code just sucks.
[23:15:32] <dr0id> so do you
[23:22:39] <liam> any ideas how  to have a lightbox style dim effect when using the blockui plugin?
[23:26:03] <eggnogg> if (action==0 && this.hasClass(className))
[23:26:04] <eggnogg> 			this.removeClass(className);
[23:26:15] <eggnogg> should I bother checking for hasClass before I run removeClass?
[23:26:36] <eggnogg> performance-wise
[23:28:25] <aple> Ah damn. I was so close.
[23:28:47] <dr0id> yet so far
[23:41:54] <ce_pemalu> hm
[23:45:47] <rknLA> ugh, so this works in my code, but not really in js fiddle.. i'm trying to illustrate my problem.. maybe it will be clear in the code?
[23:45:54] <rknLA> fiddle here:  http://jsfiddle.net/rknLA/A7tEm/5/
[23:46:07] <rknLA> it's based on http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[23:46:19] <rknLA> which uses the input's id to update the field
[23:46:54] <rknLA> the problem is finding which field was clicked and updating the right field without duplicating the code once for each field..
[23:56:14] <raj> is .val() = .value()?
[23:58:13] <lc3> raj: no
[23:59:14] <raj> is there a such thing as .value() ?
[23:59:44] <lc3> nope
