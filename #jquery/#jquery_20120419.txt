[00:05:03] <sarsntony> wow this is alot of ppl..
[00:05:18] <sarsntony> Can anybody please help me figure out how to implement a slider to my site?
[00:05:44] <sarsntony> it's giving me $("#slider").slider is not a function
[00:06:01] <Whirl3d> yup
[00:06:14] <Whirl3d> What's up billygalbreath_?
[00:06:27] <billygalbreath_> http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/6/ <- Whirl3d
[00:06:28] <sarsntony> I just copy pasted the source code from http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#steps
[00:07:24] <gf3> sarsntony: Make a JSFiddle
[00:07:30] <sarsntony> working on it
[00:07:32] <billygalbreath_> i'm pretty satisfied with that one, Whirl3d
[00:07:33] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath_, what about using .index() instead?
[00:07:34] <ravenz> or gtfo
[00:07:35] <ravenz> :d
[00:07:42] <billygalbreath_> show me
[00:07:46] <Defrothew> Can anyone guide on making like "Facebook like" style of clicking tutorials? I want to make my own but the same concept as the fb like button. Does anyone have any tutorials? Seems like I've having problem on finding a good tutorial.
[00:07:48] <Whirl3d> brb
[00:09:38] <sarsntony> hmm
[00:10:08] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/p8Yuw/9/
[00:10:10] <gf3> billygalbreath_: your doBlink function is terribly inefficient
[00:10:22] <billygalbreath_> gf3: i know, which is why i'm asking about it
[00:10:33] <sarsntony> gf3/ my site has a  $("#slider").slider is not a function problem, should I still fiddle with JSFiddle?
[00:10:35] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath_, by using index(), you don't need to rely on class names or numbers
[00:10:54] <gf3> billygalbreath_: why not use a CSS animation based on a class, then simple add/remove the class?
[00:11:11] <Whirl3d> gf3, easing
[00:11:38] <billygalbreath_> well, Whirl3d. the thing is the number is a unique id of a user, and these blinking boxes are tabs in a chat window (for private messages) and they are to blink when not in focus and a message comes in.
[00:11:39] <Whirl3d> I suppose you could do animated transitions in css3
[00:11:41] <gf3> Whirl3d: Exactly, CSS animation
[00:11:58] <gf3> see: http://daneden.me/animate/
[00:12:36] <Whirl3d> even more reason to avoid using classnames as numeric selectors for your divs/buttons
[00:12:52] <gf3> Indeed
[00:12:57] <Whirl3d> but that may be jsut for the fiddle is what you are saying, I think
[00:13:10] <gf3> If you really need to animate with JS, then you should pass the element in question to the function
[00:16:17] <billygalbreath_> gf3: those css animations seem cool. i'll see what i can throw together with them
[00:16:42] <gf3> billygalbreath_: I assure you a basic colour fade will be straight-forward in comparison
[00:16:58] <billygalbreath_> i wouldnt know where to begin with that
[00:17:03] <gf3> billygalbreath_: and the cool part is that you can simply add a class to start the animation, and remove the class to stop it
[00:17:23] <gf3> billygalbreath_: The Google™ has lots of great resources on CSS3 animations
[00:20:40] <sarsntony> grr how is $("#slider").slider not a function when I explictly import jquery.ui.slider...
[00:21:10] <Cork> sarsntony: you need jquery ui core
[00:21:35] <Cork> and draggable if i remember correctly
[00:21:40] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:40] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery_ujs.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:40] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery-1.7.2.min.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:40] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery-ui-1.8.19.custom.min.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:40] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery.ui.slider.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:41] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery.effects.slide.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:41] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/all.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:42] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/application.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:21:52] <sarsntony> oops, too long sry about that
[00:22:09] <Cork> if you have custom you don't need ui.slide
[00:22:36] <sarsntony> adding the ui.slide didn't make any difference
[00:22:49] <Cork> is $.ui.version defined?
[00:23:07] <Cork> sarsntony: its already part of the ui-custom file
[00:23:10] <Cork> so ya
[00:23:38] <sarsntony> I mean, I just threw the last ui.slider in there just for the heck of it
[00:23:41] <sarsntony> to see if it would do anything
[00:31:33] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath_, maybe it would be good to do something like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/p8Yuw/20/
[00:31:52] <Whirl3d> then you can just tell anything to blink by calling $(el).blink();
[00:32:16] <Whirl3d> then to turn it off, remove the blinking class or $(el).blink("stop");
[00:32:42] <Whirl3d> that way if you decide to go with CSS3 transforms, just change that portion of the blink plugin
[00:33:21] <Ricaz> I thought .toggle() could take 3 arguments. The two first being the two states to toggle between, and the last one is the animation duration?
[00:33:26] <Ricaz> Is that not correct?
[00:33:46] <billygalbreath_> Whirl3d: gf3: http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/21/
[00:34:06] <gf3> billygalbreath_: yayyyyy
[00:34:18] <Whirl3d> doesnt work in ie
[00:34:21] <gf3> billygalbreath_: Now you just need to add the -moz and -o versions and you're all set
[00:34:31] <gf3> Whirl3d: might work in IE10
[00:34:35] <coldhead> lol -o
[00:35:35] <Ricaz> Anyone? :)
[00:35:49] <billygalbreath_> http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/22/ <- gf3 like that? what about IE? I'm trying to support at least down to IE8 if possible.
[00:35:52] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, have you looked it up?
[00:35:56] <coldhead> ?toggle
[00:35:56] <bot-t1> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[00:36:31] <Ricaz> It says .toggle( [duration] [, easing] [, callback] ) on the documentation
[00:36:32] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath_, there are great animation replacements that automatically replace jquery animate with css3 when possible
[00:36:59] <Whirl3d> okay, did you try that?
[00:37:27] <gf3> billygalbreath_: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/02/02/css3-3d-transforms-in-ie10.aspx
[00:37:30] <Whirl3d> perhaps you are thinking about toggleClass
[00:37:36] <Whirl3d> ?.toggleClass
[00:37:37] <bot-t1> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[00:39:24] <Ricaz> Hmm. Let me make a jsfiddle, maybe I did something wrong
[00:40:06] <gf3> U DONE BROAK IT
[00:40:36] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath_, look up transitions.js (i think) on GISTHub, it describes how they extended the effects module rather than monkey patch the animate function  to enable css transforms to take the place of animate in jquery
[00:43:14] <Ricaz> http://jsfiddle.net/XrBXd/ - here it is
[00:44:47] <billygalbreath_> Whirl3d: so.. with transitions.js i could still use .animate() like I did earlier, and its going to do all the magic of using css3 animations?
[00:45:05] <Whirl3d> You will need to test it, but that's what they claim
[00:45:11] <coldhead> that's the dream
[00:45:13] <Ricaz> Well, the class disappeared
[00:45:17] <billygalbreath_> interesting
[00:45:22] <Whirl3d> so you get hardware accelleration on IOS
[00:45:33] <samzhao_> Hey everyone
[00:45:41] <Whirl3d> hey
[00:45:57] <samzhao_> Hey coldhead, hey Whirl3d
[00:46:10] <coldhead> hallo
[00:46:12] <samzhao_> Trying out irc on android
[00:46:24] <sarsntony> we got any RoR developer here?
[00:46:32] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, I've never tried to animate relative sizing for border-radius period.
[00:46:34] <samzhao_> U
[00:46:54] <billygalbreath_> i'm gonna test it. if it does work i could definitely use this on another project where i had to remove a _lot_ of my animations due to them eating up cpu so badly
[00:47:01] <Ricaz> Well, it's just an example, it's not going to be border-radius
[00:48:03] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/XrBXd/1/
[00:48:20] <Ricaz> wow
[00:48:29] <Ricaz> Why does that work >.<
[00:48:51] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, cause toggle is triggered by clicking?
[00:48:54] <samzhao_> Why??!
[00:49:07] <Ricaz> It was on mine too
[00:49:19] <Ricaz> Oh
[00:49:21] <Whirl3d> I don't define a click handler, though
[00:49:28] <Ricaz> I see
[00:50:02] <Whirl3d> you might even be able to add a third or more states to toggle
[00:50:11] <samzhao_> Whirl3d: is it safe to use?
[00:50:33] <Whirl3d> I know there was a bug for a while, but it seems to work now
[00:51:20] <Ricaz> Thank you, Whirl3d
[00:51:28] <Whirl3d> np
[00:54:23] <Whirl3d> browsers suck that they refuse to serve up local versions of content because of SOP that's BS
[00:54:55] <gf3> It's for your safety
[00:55:08] <Whirl3d> Don'te rewrite my relative urls then
[00:56:00] <coldhead> tell it to einstein
[00:56:43] <Whirl3d> I also can't believe that hackers have the ability to hack into high security companys and yet no one has hacked the SOP BS for local testing? Really?
[00:58:09] <jrockjiggz> hey.. i'm odly discovering <button> is submitting my form... any way to check it's bindings?
[01:01:51] <Ricaz> Selectors confuse me. How do I select all <p>-elements within a class?
[01:01:59] <gf3> jrockjiggz: But that's what buttons do :-/
[01:02:09] <gf3> Ricaz: What have you tried?
[01:02:29] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, use $(".class").find("p")
[01:02:40] <Ricaz> $("item").$("p") :D
[01:02:48] <Ricaz> thanks
[01:03:32] <gf3> Why not simply ".class p"?
[01:04:16] <Ricaz> oh
[01:04:21] <Ricaz> That works as well?
[01:04:24] <Whirl3d> Sure
[01:04:35] <coldhead> the only limit is yourself
[01:04:38] <gf3> ?g selectutorial @ Ricaz
[01:04:39] <bot-t1> Ricaz, Selectutorial: CSS selectors - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/
[01:04:51] <coldhead> AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE
[01:04:58] <jrockjiggz> gf3: since when did <button> submit? e.preventDefault() doesn't seem to stop it
[01:04:59] <gf3> Ding ding dingo
[01:05:16] <gf3> jrockjiggz: Since always
[01:05:22] <jrockjiggz> wow.. mind_blown
[01:05:48] <coldhead> your mind clearly needs blowing if that's all it takes
[01:05:50] <Ricaz> Thanks, I just didn't know it worked like css
[01:05:58] <jrockjiggz> what's the best way to have a <button> in a form not submit it?
[01:06:06] <coldhead> its EXACTLY like CSS only better, Ricaz
[01:06:17] <Ricaz> Sweet :)
[01:06:21] <coldhead> take everything you know about CSS selectors AND CHERISH IT DEARLY
[01:07:35] <billygalbreath_> gf3: thanks man - your css solution is working perfect - the way I have my tabs currently setup I dont even have to ever call a stop to it or change the class again, because when you click on the tab it was already setting a new class to a highlight color :D awesome!
[01:07:52] <gf3> billygalbreath_: Yayyy, the future is now
[01:07:57] <billygalbreath_> hehe
[01:08:28] <gf3> jrockjiggz: Intercept the event before it submits
[01:08:46] <coldhead> <=> interceptor <=>
[01:10:54] <dontbecold_> what is the jquery for getting the "foo" here? <a href="/bar">foo</a>
[01:11:08] <dontbecold_> I can't seem to find the right place to look in the docs because I don't know what this is classed as
[01:11:09] <NodeX> .text*(
[01:11:12] <NodeX> .text()
[01:11:13] <Whirl3d> what browser extensions do you use to analyze css and where something is being defined?
[01:11:42] <coldhead> ?text
[01:11:43] <bot-t1> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[01:11:53] <coldhead> i just use web inspector for that, Whirl3d
[01:12:09] <coldhead> the right hand pane in the element tab has files and line numbers
[01:12:26] <NodeX> firebug ftw
[01:12:45] <Whirl3d> web inspector?
[01:12:48] <coldhead> quite
[01:13:01] <coldhead> in chromium
[01:14:10] <dontbecold_> NodeX: Thank you, I was using the wrong "this" so text didn't originally work
[01:15:21] <Ricaz> So can I do something like $(this p)?
[01:15:32] <Ricaz> or $(this "p")
[01:15:46] <Whirl3d> no. $(this).find("p");
[01:15:55] <Ricaz> Alright
[01:16:13] <coldhead> or $('p', this) if you're very clever
[01:18:15] <billygalbreath_> gf3: Whirl3d: before I get started with my next step I guess I'll ask the best way of doing it. I would like to make an audible sound (nothing bothersome) and/or the title to flash in an attention getting way (like facebook chat does when you dont have focus on that window). Got anything for me?
[01:18:51] <billygalbreath_> i'm willing to let go of the sound ideo because it does seem a bit intrusive and bothersome, though
[01:18:54] <Whirl3d> sorry. Never did a thing with sound of any sort
[01:18:55] <billygalbreath_> *idea
[01:19:33] <jrockjiggz> billygalbreath_: just found this https://github.com/heyman/jquery-titlealert
[01:19:48] <gf3> billygalbreath_: http://caniuse.com/#search=audio
[01:20:39] <billygalbreath_> sweet deal guys! :D
[01:20:55] <gf3> billygalbreath_: http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/
[01:21:49] <coldhead> billygalbreath_: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/
[01:21:53] <EdwardIII> hey sorry, just being dumb here, but how come this click event is getting executed 3 times? http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/1/
[01:23:15] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, isn't it funny how people degrade themselves to the gods for support?
[01:23:27] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, 'just learning here'
[01:23:47] <Whirl3d> coldhead, the smite-ing please
[01:23:50] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[01:24:50] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, its because you are running  $('#imageSwap').find('div') which is finding 3 divs in total on the page
[01:25:07] <coldhead> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/2/
[01:25:15] <coldhead> the actual click is only happening once
[01:25:19] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[01:27:21] <EdwardIII> right you are
[01:27:23] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, you could track the last div used by adding a random class. "Fresh" then when a new click occurs, check to see if its 'Fresh' beign clicked(do nothing)
[01:27:24] <EdwardIII> hehe, a woman's love
[01:27:53] <Whirl3d> meaning you only get it once?
[01:28:02] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, if its new, fade out the 'Fresh' class, then remove it (as its the old one) than you can add it to the new clicked item
[01:28:08] <Ricaz> I have no idea why this doesn't work, then: http://jsfiddle.net/XrBXd/3/
[01:28:54] <Whirl3d> syntax errror
[01:29:01] <Whirl3d> do you have chrome or firefox?
[01:29:05] <Whirl3d> look in the console
[01:29:08] <someprimetime> what is your event you are binding to?
[01:29:18] <someprimetime> you just want it to toggle onload?
[01:29:22] <hyperstream> Ricaz, how is it being triggered?
[01:29:53] <Ricaz> By clicking the div
[01:30:09] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, you have a } before your duration
[01:30:36] <Ricaz> Yeah? to end the function :s
[01:30:54] <Whirl3d> But you can't add a duration like that
[01:30:54] <hyperstream> Ricaz, i dont see any click event, I'm most likely missing something here (doesnt make sense here lol) - at same time im not any good at anything. just average at most things lol
[01:30:59] <someprimetime> you need to add it to a click event
[01:31:02] <Whirl3d> What does the , 400 do?
[01:31:14] <Ricaz> Oh wait
[01:31:31] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/XrBXd/6/
[01:31:32] <Ricaz> Yeah that's just me messing up I think
[01:31:40] <Whirl3d> It's all clearly outlined in the console error messages
[01:31:52] <coldhead> Ricaz: http://jsfiddle.net/XrBXd/7/
[01:32:00] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, toggle works with click events
[01:32:04] <Ricaz> Yeah, the 400 was just waste from a previous mistake
[01:32:07] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: yep
[01:32:10] <someprimetime> which is why he needs to add it to one
[01:32:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/XrBXd/6/
[01:32:19] <Whirl3d> no he doesn't
[01:32:20] <hyperstream> LOL
[01:32:23] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:32:34] <someprimetime> weird
[01:32:37] <someprimetime> never knew you could do that
[01:32:44] <hyperstream> Now thats neat
[01:32:47] <someprimetime> then again i always just use toggleClass('foo bar')
[01:32:52] <hyperstream> someprimetime, same, but +1 for the comment back lol
[01:33:07] <Ricaz> Thank you :D
[01:33:18] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, if you want to add duration (or easing) to your show and hide functions, add it in the show() and hide() functions.
[01:33:29] <Whirl3d> show(400); hide(400);
[01:33:29] <coldhead> as uh i think coldhead demonstrated
[01:33:38] <coldhead> in his fiddle
[01:33:41] <Whirl3d> As uh, we both did
[01:33:44] <coldhead> which I MAY AS WELL FUCKING NOT HAVE BOTHERED WITH
[01:33:46] <Ricaz> Yes, I just messed up, because I thought toggle would take an animation duration
[01:33:47] <coldhead> APPARENTLY
[01:33:55] <coldhead> BECAUSE YOU JERKS HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL
[01:33:59] <Whirl3d> Coldhead, you know you'se my hero
[01:34:03] <someprimetime> where is Eviltwin
[01:34:06] <someprimetime> he's the mayor around here
[01:34:07] <coldhead> IF ONLY I HAD THE STRENGTH TO LOAD MY BUCKET BONG
[01:34:10] <coldhead> AND PLAY ZELDA
[01:34:19] <someprimetime> who the fuck saw refused tonight?
[01:34:20] <someprimetime> anyone else?
[01:34:24] <someprimetime> what an excellent show
[01:34:36] <Whirl3d> TV?
[01:34:39] <Whirl3d> how 80s
[01:34:56] <someprimetime> wat
[01:34:58] <someprimetime> nope
[01:34:59] <someprimetime> warfield
[01:35:01] <someprimetime> http://instagr.am/p/Jl8TskvaDh/
[01:35:23] <coldhead> oh nice
[01:35:27] <coldhead> actual shows
[01:35:30] <coldhead> those were the days
[01:35:43] <coldhead> like the buddy holly used to do
[01:35:50] <someprimetime> yep. "the" buddy holly
[01:36:27] <someprimetime> yo coldhead you gonna be hologrammed @ jquery con this year in SF?
[01:37:00] <Whirl3d> Oh, I thought you meant "rejected" LOL
[01:38:14] <devOlsen> Anyone know how to indeed find the last elements that contains a particular class? http://jsfiddle.net/EQ36U/15/ try checking off each checkbox from one to three, then un-check them from three to one.. notice how I lose my 'last-full' class?
[01:38:40] <Cork> $('.my-class').last() ?
[01:39:40] <EdwardIII> did some mad tweakage to get it working as desired, but the active classes aren't goign away, man i am dumbers today: http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/4/
[01:41:31] <thomb> hey all. what is the best way to find out the function that will be triggered on clicking an element? can firebug solve that e.g.?
[01:41:33] <EdwardIII> also... zelda?
[01:41:53] <EdwardIII> thomb: in chrome you can setup a breakpoint on all 'click' events
[01:42:44] <thomb> EdwardIII: hm chrome, im not using it. maybe i should give it a try
[01:42:48] <EdwardIII> ah wait, disregard that, should be .removeClass('active')
[01:42:49] <coldhead> hahaha i can only hope, someprimetime
[01:42:54] <Cork> devOlsen: it works for me
[01:43:09] <EdwardIII> thomb: i only say that because i don't use ff, but maybe you can use those keywords to find out how to do the same thing in firebug
[01:43:11] <Cork> devOlsen: is it that you expect the class to be on p perhaps?
[01:43:12] <EdwardIII> whatever works!
[01:43:33] <gf3> someprimetime: I think coldhead would have to die first, non?
[01:43:55] <someprimetime> gf3: i delegate that task to you
[01:44:06] <devOlsen> naw, I expect the last element that indeed will contain content to carry this class. .last() I will try again, but have already ran into issues with it in IE7.
[01:44:10] <gf3> someprimetime: Thank you, the honour is mine.
[01:44:30] <coldhead> fine by me
[01:46:27] <EdwardIII> hrm one last issue - if you click 'em really fast you end up with multiple images at the same time: http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/5/
[01:46:32] <EdwardIII> should i be using .promise() instead of the callback?
[01:46:59] <devOlsen> duh I just solved it by explaining my needs.
[01:47:06] <devOlsen> just condition off the content length.
[01:47:25] <StevenCodes> Sup devOlsen  hows your day been ?
[01:47:25] <coldhead> great work devOlsen
[01:47:45] <coldhead> EdwardIII: alert('please don\'t click these really fast')
[01:47:50] <devOlsen> lol thx coldhead. Long, yourself?
[01:47:55] <Dr-Bombay> coldhead: ship it!
[01:48:00] <coldhead> ?cc
[01:48:00] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[01:48:24] <EdwardIII> devOlsen: often the case - sometimes the act of breaking your problem down to put into a jsfiddle itself helps show the issue too
[01:48:27] <EdwardIII> coldhead: haha
[01:48:49] <Ricaz> So I have something like $("img").slideUp(200).addClass("hidden");, but it executes both at once. Can't I make it wait until slideUp() has completed?
[01:48:55] <Ricaz> I tried delay() but to no avail
[01:49:03] <devOlsen> yeah EdwardIII I did both ;)
[01:49:24] <coldhead> EdwardIII: you can either investigate the noetic mysteries of the jQuery animation queue or use something like ben almond's debounce plugin
[01:49:51] <devOlsen> Ricaz
[01:49:59] <devOlsen> use the callback of slideUp.
[01:50:05] <EdwardIII> heh
[01:50:05] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/6/
[01:50:12] <Spabby> hi there, I am using .children('input') to get all input elements in a div, but some are in a div themselves, is there a shortcut way to select all child and subchild elements please?
[01:50:18] <Ricaz> I'm not too familiar with callbacks :(
[01:50:31] <devOlsen> slideUp(200, function(){ //STUFF TO DO WHEN DONE  SLIDING });
[01:50:32] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, dont wait on the fade out , just call it and move on
[01:50:41] <Ricaz> aaah
[01:50:50] <Ricaz> Thank you, devOlsen
[01:50:53] <devOlsen> NP
[01:50:53] <Spabby> please excuse me, I rtfm and found .find
[01:50:56] <devOlsen> oops hehe np
[01:51:08] <EdwardIII> hyperstream: i may do that instead... but i was hoping i could ensure the old one was gone first
[01:52:39] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, I guess the ugliest issue would be multiple boxes as mentioned before
[01:53:31] <mikkelb> Oh boy what a weather ;)
[01:53:41] <EdwardIII> hyperstream: duplicate the boxes? i think i missed that one
[01:53:48] <EdwardIII> hyperstream: i saw the noetic mysteries heh
[01:54:17] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, multiple images @ same time *
[01:54:47] <raj> do I need js to make a link give you the file browser, vs the usual button?
[01:54:52] * mikkelb blasts the channel with: http://home.no/reddvinylene/work_or_go_out_enjoy_the_sun.mp3
[01:56:23] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, its not working, but you get the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/7/
[01:57:02] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, or disable the buttons (a links) during the fadeout
[01:57:08] <hyperstream> set the going just before the fadeout is called
[01:57:45] <coldhead> Committed revision 160801.
[02:02:27] <thomb> EdwardIII: how do you add a chrome breakpoint for every click event?
[02:04:39] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, http://jsfiddle.net/yH6V2/10/ got it working i think. cant click if its in process of changing
[02:04:53] <EdwardIII> thomb: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints#listeners
[02:05:20] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, to test, add an alert("Never reached"); after return false; watch the status, and when it it set to true, it'll exit and never reach the alert :)
[02:05:25] <EdwardIII> hyperstream: curious!
[02:05:51] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, multiple ways to skin the cat
[02:06:05] <hyperstream> still never enough cat to skin though :(
[02:06:24] <EdwardIII> heh
[02:06:26] <EdwardIII> or too much
[02:06:33] <hyperstream> never!
[02:06:44] <EdwardIII> so that just halts execution if it's in progress?
[02:06:50] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, pretty much
[02:07:03] <hyperstream> EdwardIII, i'd be going with the other way, call the fadeout and continue
[02:07:22] <hyperstream> its a fast enough fade out had hard time clicking it fast enough using fadeout setting of 'fast'
[02:09:34] <thomb> EdwardIII: thx
[02:19:01] <ximarin> hi all, question: i have checkboxes with a custom attribut called "bla": <input type="checkbox" bla="something">. Does anyone why $("input:checkbox[bla=something]") does not return any result?
[02:19:19] <gf3> ximarin: You should use data-bla
[02:19:38] <EdwardIII> hyperstream: haha yeah should've slowed it down
[02:19:44] <ximarin> gf3: thats what I did first, didntwork either
[02:19:59] <gf3> ORLY
[02:19:59] <caniuse> gf3: http://i.imgur.com/K1D2C.jpg
[02:22:10] <ximarin> hm, my 'something' is created like: var someData = doStuff(); $("input:checkbox[bla=someData]"). Could this be the cause?
[02:22:12] <gf3> ximian: http://jsfiddle.net/YNCpR/
[02:22:57] <gf3> ximian: http://jsfiddle.net/YNCpR/1/
[02:24:43] <ximarin> gf3: http://jsfiddle.net/YNCpR/2/
[02:24:52] <ximarin> thats the same situation as I have now
[02:25:27] <gf3> ximarin: Well it should be apparent from the syntax highlighting that it's just a plain string
[02:25:44] <ximarin> yeah, I've seen it...
[02:25:44] <gf3> ximarin: You're not actually interpolating `wat` into the string
[02:25:49] <ximarin> yep
[02:26:00] <gf3> ?eval var wat = "LOL"; "pee-wat"
[02:26:01] <bot-t1> gf3: "pee-wat"
[02:26:05] <gf3> ?eval var wat = "LOL"; "pee-" + wat
[02:26:06] <bot-t1> gf3: "pee-LOL"
[02:26:13] <gf3> ximarin ↑
[02:26:48] <hyperstream> ximarin, like: $("input:checkbox[data-bla="+wat+"]").length
[02:26:55] <hyperstream> ?
[02:27:25] <ximarin> yes, got it working, tx all
[02:27:38] <ximarin> I switched my highlighting now to js first...
[02:28:53] <gf3> Yayyy

[02:38:42] <faraway> hi. i have a custom input element, and a $("body").on("change",….) now i'm wondering it i can create a custom on change event for this element that will trigger the callback of the body. i tired trigger("change") but that does not seem to work.
[02:40:02] <Cork> faraway: its a jquery ui element?
[02:40:09] <Cork> or just native jquery?
[02:40:12] <Dr-Bombay> was the input element's event handler attached by jquery?
[02:40:53] <faraway> Cork: just a native jquery
[02:41:11] <Cork> and what do you run trigger on?
[02:41:25] <Cork> (and where)
[02:42:05] <DelTree> 71
[02:42:08] <DelTree> oops...
[02:42:23] <Dr-Bombay> deltree: correct, you win!
[02:42:25] <Cork> hmm i think the answer is 42623
[02:42:27] <Cork> :D
[02:43:05] <DelTree> :)
[02:43:22] <faraway> Cork: oh sorry … it has thrown an exception which was catched so i didn't see it
[02:59:27] <rethus> whats the best covverflow plugin ffor jquery?
[03:08:35] <EdwardIII> hrm when using jQuery it's a pain in the testes trying to figure out which function is bound to the click on a particular button because i have to click 'step into next function call' 1,0000,000,000,001 times
[03:09:14] <EdwardIII> and if i just step out of current function i never see the actual code i'm hunting for (the actual user-written code, not the innards of jquery.min.js)
[03:09:33] <Pallet> hi all
[03:09:48] <Pallet> my code in FB keeps refering to https://d3lvr7yuk4uaui.cloudfront.net/items/loaders/loader_1036.js?aoi=1311798366&pid=1036&zoneid=12768
[03:10:01] <Pallet> but I can't see what it is, does anyone have any idea
[03:10:02] <Pallet> please
[03:10:20] <Pallet> is it something being called from jQuery
[03:11:32] <xec> EdwardIII, Pallet: try looking at the stack trace?
[03:12:20] <Pallet> xec, sorry, where ?
[03:12:55] <EdwardIII> xec: hrm, i can't see the stack trace in the debug panel on the right. i can see the call stack but nothing that points outside of jquery.min.js
[03:13:15] <xec> Pallet: jQuery is not going to load some arbitrary url on its own, some jquery method/function is being called from somewhere else
[03:14:42] <xec> EdwardIII: yeah call stack is what i meant, is your site live somewhere?
[03:15:13] <EdwardIII> xec: hrm not right now, but i am talking in general terms
[03:15:35] <EdwardIII> i don't see it in the stack trace until after i've clicked step into muchos
[03:15:49] <phrozen_> hello, I have a problem http://pastebin.com/H0ZNB5f3 how to tell jQuery should submit clicked form ? I have few forms with deleted_confirmation class
[03:17:50] <xec> EdwardIII: i'm not sure i understand what your situation is, maybe you could whip up a demo in jsfiddle and explain some steps?
[03:19:24] <Trisox> where looking for a junior / senior web developer in the netherlands any one intrested? pm me
[03:29:59] <phrozen_> hello, I have a problem http://pastebin.com/H0ZNB5f3 how to tell jQuery should submit clicked form ? I have few forms with deleted_confirmation class | one more time ;>
[03:34:03] <EdwardIII> xec: let's say this bit of javascript is burried deep amidst thousands of lines of code written by someone else: http://jsfiddle.net/sWxPL/
[03:34:51] <EdwardIII> xec: i need to track it down, so i add a breakpoint on chrome on all click events. i click the button, but to try and track down the relevant pony-making code i have to click 'step into' many times before i even get out of jquery.min.js
[03:35:12] <EdwardIII> xec: is there an easier way to filter out the lower level stuff to get to the higher stuff?
[03:36:24] <xec> i'm usually in firebug, how would you  set a breakpoint on all click events in chrome?
[03:37:57] <EdwardIII> xec: you click the 'scripts' tab, then on the right column expand Event Listener Breakpoints -> Mouse -> Click
[03:38:54] <Pallet> can anyone with FF and FB please go to https://uk.purchaseseal.net/blank.html
[03:39:02] <Pallet> its just a blank page
[03:39:15] <Pallet> but it's throwing errors
[03:39:23] <Woet> the page is blank, Pallet
[03:39:31] <Woet> which errors?
[03:39:38] <Pallet> Woet, do you have FB, console open ?
[03:39:46] <Woet> Pallet: FB meaning facebook?
[03:39:51] <Pallet> firebug
[03:40:08] <Woet> well, it shows no errors in google chrome console
[03:40:12] <Pallet> no
[03:40:12] <Woet> but let me check
[03:40:38] <Woet> no errors in firebug either
[03:40:47] <Woet> as expected
[03:40:57] <Pallet> event is not defined
[03:40:57] <Pallet> https://d3lvr7yuk4uaui.cloudfront.net/items/loaders/loader_1036.js?aoi=1311798366&pid=1036&zoneid=12768
[03:40:57] <Pallet> Line 1
[03:41:03] <Pallet> keep getting that
[03:41:16] <Woet> well, that is not about that page
[03:41:28] <Defrothew> Whats wrong of my code?
[03:41:28] <Defrothew>         $("#myModal-2").modal({show:true, backdrop:true, keyboard: true});
[03:41:48] <Pallet> apreciated, but when I click on the Blank page, that's what I get
[03:41:58] <Pallet> if Firebug screwed ?
[03:42:01] <Woet> Pallet: http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/797547
[03:42:10] <Woet> seems to be a virus.
[03:42:14] <Woet> or rogue addon
[03:42:50] <Pallet> Woet, I owe you a beer !!!!!
[03:46:37] <xec> EdwardIII: ah, i see. not sure how you could get around that. if you have a few suspect handlers you could throw some debugger statements and see when/if your code stops. or mabye have a look at the element's jquery event handlers directly
[03:47:26] <`poo> poo
[03:47:28] <xec> EdwardIII: something like http://jsfiddle.net/sWxPL/2/
[03:50:52] <Pallet> Woet, disabled ALL my addons except Firebug and it's all good ;)
[03:51:59] <EdwardIII> xec: yeah, sometimes i just have code though and i'm not sure where to start looking, though there might be a way to exclude particular files from triggering breakpoint checks
[03:52:02] <EdwardIII> or something sexy
[03:52:29] <xec> yeah that would be cool
[03:54:53] <sunbeam> how can I remove a class (with its contents) from a page after the page is loaded (with web developer bar or firebug)( ?
[03:55:28] <unCork> you mean remove the element with a specific class=
[03:55:30] <unCork> *?
[03:55:31] <kingnebula> sunbeam, $('.mytargetclass').remove()
[04:00:13] <sunbeam> thanks
[04:00:14] <sunbeam> yep
[04:01:32] <sunbeam> $(".form_error_text").remove();
[04:01:39] <sunbeam> TypeError: $(".form_error_text") is null
[04:01:41] <sunbeam> hmm
[04:02:26] <Cork> sunbeam: then $ isn't jquery
[04:02:37] <Cork> try jQuery('.class').remove()
[04:03:55] <sunbeam> oh also the class is at the begin of the file (before html)
[04:04:11] <Cork> uh what?
[04:04:15] <`poo> uh what do i do when i tried to register with nickserv with the wrong email ; \
[04:04:15] <xec> o.O
[04:04:16] <Cork> thats not valid
[04:04:30] <Cork> `poo: ask in #freenode
[04:04:44] <`poo> tnx
[04:04:47] <Cork> i think its something about letting it expire
[04:04:57] <`poo> ah right
[04:05:04] <sunbeam> Cork: i know, i am just debugging a site
[04:05:07] <Cork> but ask them, they might have a way
[04:05:14] <`poo> nah i'll wait it out i guess. thx
[04:05:26] <Cork> sunbeam: how can a class be before html??
[04:05:41] <Cork> you have a div before it or something?
[04:06:33] <sunbeam> nvm i found another way to test it and properly display
[04:09:01] <wodemaye_> how come this doesn't work? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0o
[04:10:36] <xec> wodemaye_: because you have </script> in your inline script
[04:11:02] <Cork> wodemaye_: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0q
[04:11:14] <`poo> you can write javascript: inside the script tag??
[04:11:21] <Cork> sure
[04:11:35] <wodemaye_> wait, what?
[04:11:52] <Cork> wodemaye_: the parser will find the </script> tag
[04:11:57] <Cork> so your script gets cut off
[04:12:08] <wodemaye_> ahhh...
[04:12:38] <Cork> but ya, the javascript: part isn't needed
[04:12:52] <wodemaye_> still doesn't work as expected.
[04:13:18] <Cork> it won't work on that site as your doing xss
[04:13:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Nothing ever works as expected :P
[04:13:32] <Cork> but if your ran it on tiswww.case.edu it would work
[04:14:14] <wodemaye_> even simpler http://www.webdevout.net/test?0s
[04:14:34] <wodemaye_> also doesn't work.
[04:14:55] <Cork> sure dom ready will be missed as your loading jquery after its loaded
[04:15:12] <Cork> so the $ won't be defined
[04:15:32] <xec> why are you using document.write() anyway
[04:15:37] <`poo> ^^
[04:16:29] <Acrack> hellow
[04:16:41] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Hey Acrack
[04:16:48] <xec> helhigh
[04:17:02] <Cork> O_o
[04:17:27] <Acrack> :D
[04:18:01] <wodemaye_> Cork, can you elaborate a bit?
[04:18:30] <Cork> wodemaye_: flow is: page start loading, it hits the document write, that writes to the body
[04:18:40] <Cork> then it hits the $(document).ready thats undefined
[04:18:50] <Cork> then it starts parsing the body and loads jquery
[04:19:09] <xec> wodemaye_: step 1. include jquery first, without document write!
[04:19:11] <Cork> you need to delay your use of jquery until its loaded
[04:19:21] <Cork> or add jquery to your header
[04:19:24] <xec> wodemaye_: step 2: do jquery on ready stuff
[04:19:35] <xec> wodemaye_: step 3: ?
[04:19:42] <xec> wodemaye_: step 4: profit!
[04:19:54] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Step 5: World domination!
[04:19:56] <wodemaye_> Corey, how do i delay till its loaded?
[04:20:09] <xec> i feel ignored =(
[04:20:23] <Cork> wodemaye_: use the js native event handlers
[04:20:24] <wodemaye_> sorry xec
[04:20:30] <ChrisTheSorcerer> wodenmaye_ What was the reason to not include the jquery link in the header?
[04:20:41] <wodemaye_> ChrisTheSorcerer, complicated. :-\
[04:20:45] <Cork> ya, that would be the best solution
[04:20:53] <wodemaye_> but there is one, i assure you.
[04:21:06] <wodemaye_> Cork, w/o doing that though...
[04:21:12] <Cork> you can't
[04:21:26] <xec> no profit
[04:21:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> My puny brain can't figure one out, but I believe you... but you have to make sure it is included before you use any jquery :P
[04:22:05] <Bauer> using http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ and .error() method, how do I print an alert with the actual cause of the error? and not just invoke some error function which doesnt know what caused the problem?
[04:22:19] <Cork> wodemaye_: listning to DOMContentLoaded and/or load is the only way to get it to work without jqeury
[04:22:26] <wodemaye_> i thought the order was... load head, open body, hit <script> run 1st js line, which is document.write... jq <script> gets written into the document, and part of that process is to run thru jq.min.js and exec all of it, defining $, then move on to next inline js line, which starts relying on jq...
[04:22:28] <Cork> *jquery
[04:22:34] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/ how to select a div when answerid = 6 ?
[04:22:45] <Acrack> or 5 or w/e ^^
[04:23:07] <Cork> wodemaye_: no document.write adds to the END of the document
[04:23:11] <xec> wodemaye_: if you really really really need to document.write() the jquery inclusion (i don't believe you, but that's beside the point) why don't you just document.write() include the rest of your script as well
[04:23:27] <Cork> wodemaye_: so you would have to document.write your js to the document to run it after jquery
[04:23:47] <Cork> and that would really make your page confusing to read
[04:24:33] <Cork> wodemaye_: and honserly, you shouldn't be using document.write at all
[04:24:57] <xec> EVER!
[04:24:59] <xec> :d
[04:25:10] <Cork> not to add scripts or add things to the page
[04:25:14] <xec> stupid caps lock
[04:25:33] <Cork> it fitted so :)
[04:27:06] <xec> but it messed up my smileyface! *frown*
[04:27:55] <wodemaye_> still dont work http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E
[04:27:55] <xec> maybe i should just spell out all my smileys from now on *smile with a wink*
[04:28:22] <Cork> xec: don't make me hit you...
[04:28:48] <xec> *gasping frowneyface*
[04:28:52] <wodemaye_> Cork, i'm not trying to "get that code to run without jq" - i'm trying to "get jq to load for the sake of subsequent jq-dependent code"
[04:29:01] <wodemaye_> that's just filler to figure out how to load up jq in js.
[04:29:20] <Bauer> guys, this is the jquery script: http://pastebin.com/vBwJzwSd when it is invoked, I get error: object Object - how to figure out the cause of the error? why the request is being cancelled? I see this in Network tab in Chrome
[04:29:37] <Acrack> guyz i want to give points when someone click on a link, im stuck can somebody look to this little easy code please ?
[04:29:37] <Acrack> when i someone click on "plus" i want the zero to become 1 http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/1/
[04:30:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> wodemaye_: How about something like <script id="script1"></script> in the head and in your script later have getElementById('script1').src = "jquery-link-here";?
[04:30:09] <Cork> wodemaye_: you can't linebreak your strings
[04:30:31] <wodemaye_> Cork, ugh.
[04:30:36] <wodemaye_> ChrisTheSorcerer, unfortunately, no.
[04:31:03] <wodemaye_> Basically, I'm working on paring down my app's embed code as much as possible.
[04:31:14] <wodemaye_> like, REALLY, REALLY paring it down.
[04:31:15] <xec> wodemaye_: maybe have a look at http://requirejs.org/ or http://ender.no.de/
[04:31:36] <Cork> wodemaye_: your over complicating things
[04:31:49] <Cork> doesn't see how this changes anything
[04:32:19] <Cork> wodemaye_: anyway this would work http://www.webdevout.net/test?0F
[04:32:22] <Myx0x3> im trying to select an input inside an radio without sucess, heres what i do: "$('[name=type][value="traffic"]').prop('checked',true)"
[04:32:28] <Cork> but theres many other ways to do this
[04:32:30] <wodemaye_> Cork, basically my users will have a snippet to put into their webpages.
[04:32:45] <Cork> wodemaye_: theres still better ways to do this
[04:32:45] <StevenCodes> anyyone got a sample of a button that floats on bottom of page and slides out as a dialog
[04:33:10] <wodemaye_> and ideally i want to reduce that to a single line that isn't ugly/intimidating/unwieldly/likely to be mangled in any way for them...
[04:33:19] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: What is answer-votes? I see no such class in there
[04:33:22] <wodemaye_> Cork, like what?
[04:33:57] <wodemaye_> xec, thanks i'm checking out endernode.
[04:33:58] <Cork> wodemaye_: to start with, don't use code.jquery.com if you want to distribute the script
[04:34:07] <wodemaye_> requirejs was a pain in the ass, i'd seen it before.
[04:34:08] <xec> Myx0x3: "input inside an radio"? what?
[04:34:10] <Cork> wodemaye_: that url is meant for downloading its not a cdn
[04:34:19] <wodemaye_> Cork, i know, i know.
[04:34:29] <wodemaye_> this is just a sloppy test thing for me to hash this out.
[04:34:40] <wodemaye_> Cork, although out of curiosity, why can't it be used that way?
[04:34:54] <Cork> give me a sec and i'll give you an example
[04:35:18] <Myx0x3> xec: an input field within an radio type.. but i found an answer.. useing attr() instead
[04:36:02] <ChrisTheSorcerer> wodemaye_: for one, it would slow down the servers by having milions of pings to it if everyone linked to it, and that's no fair for people trying to use the server. Secondly, the server might not be up forever, and the file might someday be corrupted or removed, and then your site would break
[04:36:04] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: sec gonna make the html better
[04:36:32] <Cork> wodemaye_: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0G
[04:36:51] <granden>   //$.getJSON(url, {tags: "newNews"}, function(data) { if( data[0] ){ // do stuff here }});
[04:36:55] <granden> could I do like that?
[04:37:14] <granden> it is that if( data[0] ) that is not working for me for some reason
[04:37:30] <granden> oh, and it is not commented in the code :)
[04:38:06] <Cork> wodemaye_: thats a sain way to do it if you really need to load the script through js
[04:38:22] <xec> granden: is data an array? with one or more values?
[04:38:49] <wodemaye_> Cork, thank you very much, that snippet is a lifesaver.
[04:39:10] <granden> xec: data is an array yes, with only 1 value as of now.
[04:39:13] <xec> granden: if you want to check for contents of an array you could do if (array.length)
[04:39:17] <wodemaye_> xec, i really appreciate the actual help to the q i asked as opposed to lecturing and grilling me for not doing something how you would.
[04:40:00] <wodemaye_> (i don't minnd mentioning that, it could actually be helpful to. but it's not a substitute for what the person is looking ofr)
[04:40:07] <QWeb> Hi guys
[04:40:09] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/7/ when i click on "plus" i want the content of "answer-rate" to go 1
[04:40:14] <wodemaye_> and xec sorry it was a typo+tab completion to address your nick.
[04:40:36] <wodemaye_> Cork, altho your code still doesn't work.  try clicking the button.
[04:41:15] <Cork> wodemaye_: your not adding any code for the button :)
[04:41:30] <xec> he removed your function in favor of a simple hello world
[04:41:42] <Cork> no it was already removed
[04:42:04] <QWeb> I'm trying to find the href attribute of a clicked link, but I have to use .live or .on as the links are injected sometimes. I'm somewhat baffled as to why this won't work though: $('.jsHideWidget').on('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); alert($(this).attr('href');); });
[04:42:09] <xec> oic
[04:42:26] <Cork> wodemaye_: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0H
[04:42:36] <granden> xec: I-m not looking for the length of an array, maybe I was not clear with what I meant
[04:42:37] <QWeb> Basically, $(this).attr('href') is returning an object instead of the value
[04:43:12] <wodemaye_> still don't work Cork
[04:43:18] <wodemaye_> try clicking the button.
[04:43:19] <Cork> wfm >_>
[04:43:34] <Cork> i do and "This is Hello World by JQuery" is added
[04:43:41] <xec> granden: if (arr.length) { /* this will be executed if the array has any members */ }
[04:44:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: checking it out (haven't forgotten you :P)
[04:44:09] <wodemaye_> with the 0H link?
[04:44:15] <Cork> yes
[04:44:23] <Cork> click display if you've already clicked the link
[04:44:26] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: thanks mate
[04:44:28] <Cork> s/link/button/
[04:44:45] <xec> granden: it's a common way to check if an array is empty or not, as 0 is falsy and 1,2,3 etc are truthy - but maybe this isn't what you were after?
[04:45:28] <wodemaye_> ok, sweet.  just tried it in epiphany, was in icemonkey b4.
[04:45:33] <granden> I dont want to check if it is empty or not, I would like to retrive a certain element in my jsonp
[04:45:34] <wodemaye_> Cork, thanks a lot, again.
[04:45:42] <Cork> np
[04:45:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: It works fine as you wrote it, but you forgot to set jsfiddle to jquery ;)
[04:46:29] <xec> granden: okay... why the if() ?
[04:46:37] <Acrack> rofl.....
[04:46:53] <Acrack> but my main problem is
[04:47:15] <Acrack> that i dont want all 0 to go 1
[04:47:38] <Acrack> if u got me ^^
[04:47:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Trying to play around right now to see if I can think of something... but bear in mind that I haven't really done much jquery, or JS at all... just started a month ago, so my sollution might not be the most efficient ;)
[04:48:20] <xec> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/9/ ?
[04:48:22] <Acrack> i started jquery a week ago :D
[04:48:41] <granden> xec: Because if that element in the jsonp is "0" it should not do anything if it is "1" it should execute some code
[04:48:46] <granden> but I found another error in my code
[04:49:00] <Acrack> xec yes this ^^
[04:49:01] <granden> not closing all [{( and stuff
[04:49:04] <Acrack> what next() do?
[04:49:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> xec: wouldn't that only work if answer-rate was the very next HTML element?
[04:49:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?next
[04:49:17] <bot-t1> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[04:49:20] <xec> ChrisTheSorcerer: indeed
[04:49:23] <Acrack> cause i have many elements
[04:49:24] <Acrack> ^^
[04:49:26] <Acrack> look
[04:49:42] <xec> Acrack: then you could group them and look for a common ancestor
[04:50:32] <ChrisTheSorcerer> could do this thou: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/11/
[04:50:51] <ChrisTheSorcerer> .next('.answer-rate') ;)
[04:50:52] <Acrack> xec what you did is good ^^ i was wrong :p
[04:51:03] <Acrack> answer rate is the next element anyway
[04:51:03] <Acrack> ^^
[04:51:23] <Acrack> yep ok thanks to both of you :)
[04:51:28] <xec> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/13/
[04:51:28] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yeah, but what if you want to put it in another div, or add a linebreak or whatever at some point?
[04:51:49] <Acrack> is there previous ?
[04:51:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> *prev
[04:52:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> ?prev
[04:52:01] <xec> Acrack: yes, see ?prev
[04:52:02] <bot-t1> Acrack, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[04:52:02] <Acrack> cause i made wrong html my answer rate is before :p
[04:52:02] <bot-t1> .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[04:52:05] <Acrack> ok
[04:52:17] <Acrack> perfect :p
[04:52:19] <Acrack> ty
[04:52:26] <xec> the last link i made would work for both
[04:52:40] <xec> but you would need to group them
[04:53:06] <Acrack> i think i ll use prev ^^
[04:53:28] <Acrack> answer-rate is always on top of answer-plus in any case
[04:53:36] <xec> yeah, it's fine as long as you can depend on the html to stay the same
[04:54:14] <ChrisTheSorcerer> if nothing else, just write .next('.answer-rate') and you'll be sure it's that div that's changed
[04:54:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> *.prev of course
[04:54:53] <Acrack> ^^
[04:58:41] <Acrack> gtg cya
[04:58:45] <Acrack> ty
[04:59:42] <wodemaye_> Cork, it's only working in epiphany - not icemonkey.
[04:59:46] <wodemaye_> i wonder why that is.
[05:00:04] <Cork> wodemaye_: funkar find i firefox here
[05:00:09] <Cork> bah cross language >_<
[05:00:17] <Cork> works fine here in firefox
[05:01:39] <wodemaye_> Cork, meh. i'm in a debian livecd so maybe something's weird.
[05:01:56] <wodemaye_> i guess i wont worry abt it.
[05:02:19] <ChrisTheSorcerer> lol Cork, didn't know you were swedish too... I'm starting to think this chan can be switched to swedish soon :P
[05:02:38] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: ya, its quite a lot of sweds here :)
[05:02:40] <StevenCodes> lol
[05:02:58] <Cork> depending on the time of day though
[05:03:22] <egsome> When I make GET AJAX Request using jQuery, I get not <script ..> in the response, although I see them in Network tab of Developers Tools !
[05:03:32] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: Might be the time thou, it's prime work time here, so it's us, the dutch and the germans that have this time, UK in an hour and Finland/austria an hour ago
[05:03:50] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem when I do an AJAX call using jquery: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://operations.ccccloud.com/API/InternalStore/CheckUsername.php?username=34534. Origin https://internet-store-dev.ccccloud.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. even though I have set document.domain = "ccccloud.com"; as explained in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[05:03:55] <Bauer> any ideas how to solve it?
[05:04:30] <egsome> Bauer, Domain is Different !
[05:05:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Bauer: It's not the same origin, one is in subdomain operations and the other in subdomain internet-store-dev
[05:05:37] <Bauer> egsome and ChrisTheSorcerer : yes but the wiki page says you can work around that by setting document.domain = "ccccloud.com";
[05:07:01] <egsome> Bauer, So, What is the use of Same Origin Policy if there's such workaround ?
[05:07:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Bauer: Did you do this on both?
[05:07:48] <T-Co> I have a troubling issue... Would someone care to take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/egLByANe The promises array is not passed in second round because it's not in scope. What would be an easy way to achieve this?
[05:08:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> egsome: The use of the policy is to prevent people from working around security by using httprequest, if you can manipulate both documents and set them to the same domain, then you clearly have that access and a workaround would be perfectly valid
[05:08:32] <Bauer> ChrisTheSorcerer: no, the operations is only an API call server, it does not load scripts which need to do XHR request elsewhere
[05:08:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> T-Co: Without even looking, I'd say make it global
[05:08:36] <egsome> ChrisTheSorcerer, Umm, That's good point ..
[05:09:02] <Bauer> egsome: appearantly there is a workaround I was suggested to try, reading over it now: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing
[05:09:32] <ChrisTheSorcerer> T-Co: After looking, I still say make it global!
[05:10:19] <ChrisTheSorcerer> http://pastebin.com/BB7B515b
[05:11:37] <wodemaye_> Cork, schweet! http://www.webdevout.net/test?01i&raw
[05:13:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> wodemaye_: Yaay
[05:15:40] <Cork> wodemaye_: ah, you got it working (i got stuck in a phone call)
[05:16:09] <wodemaye_> Cork, yup. no worries :0
[05:16:11] <wodemaye_> :)
[05:20:02] <newcode> if I do this.container.append(this.item), how can I later retrieve item to do something like item.show() ?
[05:20:16] <newcode> it seems like if I do this.item.show() it does not do anything
[05:20:41] <px12> could someone tell me how to unbind all events related to keyboard from document?
[05:23:08] <ChrisTheSorcerer> newcode: this is only for the currently used object/element, you can't use that later unless you bind it to a variable. Try something like "var savedItem = this.item;"
[05:23:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> then you'll just use savedItem.show()
[05:23:24] <Cork> px12: you mean every element in the document or on the document element?
[05:23:51] <px12> well.. just take an element with id x. now how do i unbind all keyboard related events from it?
[05:24:05] <newcode> ChrisTheSorcerer: ok, or I guess I could use a class or id to retrieve them, one they are added to the dom
[05:24:26] <Cork> px12: $('#x').unbind('keydown keyup keypress')
[05:24:40] <px12> okay. thanks. :P
[05:27:25] <D4> I'm in a section > nav > ul > li > a :: .on('click' function() { $(this).next('aside') }) <-- how can I target the "aside" in the same 'section'?
[05:27:33] <px12> Cork: could you help me out a bit? check out http://blog.crister.tk/web/alphainside/index_new.htm all js is still on the same page.. and there's this $('#top-blc').click(function(){... even if i do this unbinding.. i still cannot enter spaces in the contact us form :/ and i do remember that earlier when i added just unbind('keydown'); it worked perfectly and for some reason its not working now :/
[05:29:16] <D4> as in there's also a section > aside .. ?
[05:29:50] <D4> .parent().parent().parent().find('aside') doesn't seem optimal to me ;o
[05:31:44] <D4> Tried .closest('aside') as well, doesn't give anything when console.log()'ing it :/
[05:32:43] <pachet> D4: .closest('section').next('aside')?
[05:32:54] <D4> Oh, good idea lemme try :)
[05:33:01] <px12> COrk: ? :P
[05:33:07] <px12> Cock: ? :P
[05:33:12] <px12> sorry. :P
[05:33:16] <px12> Cork: ? :P
[05:33:34] <D4> pachet  Still only getting [] in the console log
[05:33:43] <Cork> px12: one sec
[05:34:06] <D4> var details = $(this).closest('section').next('aside'); console.log(details);
[05:34:17] <px12> hmm
[05:34:39] <Domino> hi!
[05:35:17] <Cork> px12: your running it on document
[05:35:28] <px12> yeah.. so?
[05:35:32] <Cork> px12: the thing a gave you only works on the specific element it was binded to
[05:35:56] <pachet> D4: oh i'm sorry, that'd be children, not next
[05:36:01] <pachet> still having my coffee :[
[05:36:13] <D4> pachet  I did .find() and it seems to work, should I be using .children('aside') ?
[05:36:16] <Domino> i need help for get the idname out of an object
[05:36:29] <pachet> D4: http://jsfiddle.net/J2huq/
[05:36:33] <pachet> yeah, children is faster
[05:36:36] <D4> Does .find have to search th, ok thanks
[05:36:44] <px12> see.. this plugin called boutique bind keypresses for space and arrow keys to this slideshow on the homepage.. so.. what i want to do is unbind the presses when someone opens the contact us form. how do you suggest i do it?
[05:36:47] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Domino: How do you mean?
[05:36:49] <pachet> yes, .find loops through all child elems
[05:36:56] <px12> Cork: ^
[05:37:05] <pachet> well, there are optimizations when you map to a tag name
[05:37:18] <pachet> since that's a single method call in most browsers
[05:37:19] <pachet> but
[05:37:40] <Domino> var pass1 = $("#" + "Password"); if i do pass1.val() i get the value in the input box
[05:38:01] <Domino> but if i want to retrive the name of the input field?
[05:38:14] <pachet> Domino: $(foo).attr('name')
[05:38:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Domino: pass1.attr('name')
[05:39:19] <ChrisTheSorcerer> or rather $('#Password').attr('name')
[05:39:23] <Domino> tnks
[05:40:21] <Domino> where i can find documentation on all command (.attr, .val etc.. ) that i can use with element
[05:40:23] <px12> Cork? :P
[05:41:18] <collypops> Domino, every time you use the $() function, a jQuery object is returned, so you can use _any_ of the library functions on it.
[05:41:25] <Cork> px12: look into the plugin what element it binds the listner to
[05:41:29] <Cork> px12: and unbind them
[05:41:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Domino: Try http://api.jquery.com
[05:42:03] <collypops> Nearly all of those functions return the same jQuery object (or an updated one if it performed modifications or did any traversal), so you can keep chaining the functions.
[05:42:26] <px12> lemme try that.
[05:42:53] <Domino> many tnks for the help
[05:43:33] <px12> Cork: nope it doesnt help :/
[05:43:48] <px12> Cork: any idea how could i unbind all keypress events from the document?
[05:45:59] <pachet> $('*').unbind('keypress')
[05:46:14] <pachet> but that's like blasting the soil of an archaeological dig with a shotgun because you can't find your chisel
[05:46:15] * Cork nods
[05:46:23] <StevenCodes> pachet,  neat never thought of using the * in jq
[05:46:27] <Cork> and its likly to be madingly slow
[05:46:47] <Cork> px12: have you tried to do the unbind on the field it self?
[05:47:16] <Cork> if so you can try to bind a listner and prevent det propagation to prevent the listner from killing the default action :)
[05:47:31] <px12> Cock: btw, i found it, it bind keydown to document. and no i didn't tried it yet.. lemme do that now.
[05:47:52] <pachet> you have to start hitting that 'r' key properly ...
[05:47:59] <Cork> px12: $('input, textarea').keypress(function(event) { event.stopPropagation() });
[05:48:00] <`poo> lol@Cock.
[05:48:26] <px12> hehe.. sorry. :P
[05:51:18] <D4> pachet  Mind taking a look and see if you could help me? -- http://npp-dev.se/sciencepark/new/index3.html :: I'm trying to make the "More" button animate some content from the right to left replacing what's already there.. It does that but it's as if the space the initial content is still taken for some reason. Any ideas? :D
[05:53:50] <D4> I've got the "hidden" content set with a width of 0, and on click it animates it from float: right to 100% width, so it feels as if it comes from the right.. Not sure this is the best way but, nonetheless the "space" from the other content is still present for some reason. Any idea how I could do it otherwise?
[05:54:11] <suedoh> anyone can point out to me why sometimes stylesheet and javascript are included with two slashes?  such as   src="//path/here/"  and href="//hostname.com/path/here.css" ?
[05:54:37] <px12> well i found a fix now how do i unbind such that i only unbind spacebar?
[05:54:55] <Cork> uh...
[05:55:02] <Cork> you would have to check the pressed key
[05:55:02] <collypops> suedoh, that's a trick used to load resources over the same protocol
[05:55:23] <px12> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7501019/unbind-special-keypress-event
[05:55:24] <collypops> so if you're using https, the resource will also be loaded over https
[05:55:29] <px12> what is that? o.O
[05:55:31] <suedoh> i'm not sure i understand, but do you mean over http:// protocol or https?
[05:55:31] <suedoh> oh
[05:55:32] <suedoh> okay
[05:55:36] <dwarder> jquery ui plugins (i.e. widget factory) they trigger arbitrary events by this._trigger('myArbitraryEvent'),this.element, date); what the point? they(events i.e. myArbitraryEvent) are not defined anywhere? how are they used?
[05:55:37] <collypops> yes
[05:55:52] <suedoh> thanks
[05:55:56] <collypops> sometimes you need to load things over the same protocol, such as google analytics
[05:56:14] <dwarder> ohh nevermind, i got it
[05:56:16] <gnarf> dwarder: it lets you bind to those events - although they usually have a prefex as well
[05:56:32] <collypops> by removing the protocol from the URL, you can still make cross-domain requests without knowing the current protocol
[05:57:38] <dwarder> gnarf: the plugin that i look at has no prefixes, and as i understood i can subscribe to this events by $( "#something" ).bind( "myArbitraryEvent", function( event ) {} );
[05:58:15] <collypops> suedoh - some more reading on the subject: http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/
[05:58:41] <steveccc> I have an li with an a within it with a class of menuparent. within this li with a another ul with li items but these do not have the menuparent class. Its a hover menu and hence I wanted to remove the click event from the first li item - I have done this with e.preventDefault(); with the selector of .menuparent - however it seems to be taking click events away from the ul within it - is this normal?
[05:59:33] <dwarder> gnarf: right? :)
[05:59:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> steveccc: Yes, that would be because children inherits from its parent
[06:00:02] <suedoh> collypops, what's the support browser wise?
[06:00:15] <suedoh> will it work across older browsers like IE6?
[06:00:32] <ChrisTheSorcerer> steveccc: Try giving the menu items a class and give that class a onclick event
[06:00:41] <gnarf> dwarder: which plugin?
[06:00:41] <collypops> it'll work in all browsers
[06:00:46] <gnarf> dwarder: and which event?
[06:00:49] <collypops> there's only one quirk though
[06:01:52] <collypops> in IE versions up to and including 8, if you use it on a <link> tag (i.e. to load a CSS file), it'll get downloaded twice
[06:01:59] <collypops> not a big problem though
[06:02:15] <dwarder> gnarf: weekcalendar and it has several events like: reachedmindate, reachedmaxdate, resize, changedate
[06:02:40] <Domino> there is something like print_r in jquery?
[06:02:43] <gnarf> dwarder: hrm - third party plugin - i'm not really sure
[06:02:47] <gnarf> Domino: console.log
[06:02:56] <dwarder> gnarf: https://github.com/robmonie/jquery-week-calendar/wiki/
[06:03:14] <dwarder> gnarf: i beleive it comply to widget factory
[06:03:16] <collypops> suedoh, the article I linked you to explains the situation
[06:03:22] <dwarder> coplies*
[06:03:25] <steveccc> christhesorcerer: is there a better method - basically they are all a href link elements but I want to remove the click from the parent elements but not the children - is there a way I can select just the top level elements?
[06:03:36] <Acrack> back :D
[06:03:42] <Acrack> with more problems hahaah
[06:04:07] <gnarf> dwarder: that code is so legacy it hurts
[06:04:35] <gnarf> dwarder: My experiences with UI are mostly 1.8 and our development 1.9 branch
[06:05:11] <dwarder> gnarf: well, i have it already working in the project, i need to modify it in certain way, thank you )
[06:05:22] <gnarf> ?glwt
[06:05:23] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[06:05:30] <dwarder> :)
[06:05:39] <gnarf> I would almost suggest going to that fork he mentions that supports jQuery 1.4+ and UI 1.8
[06:06:09] <Domino> gnarf tnks
[06:06:28] <dwarder> yes, i'm using this fork ...
[06:06:36] <sifi> hey guys, is there a way to uninitialize a plugin?
[06:06:39] <dwarder> sorry i didn't notice it
[06:07:14] <collypops> sifi, only if it's built into the plugin
[06:07:50] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: still here ?
[06:07:50] <nathanstaines> are you able to animate the change in width on toggleClass?
[06:07:55] <sifi> collypops: that is what I thought, I was just making sure.  Thanks.
[06:08:07] <collypops> sifi: no worries
[06:08:16] <FernandoBasso> For some reason "hash" is not being assigned a value: window.location.hash = $(this).attr("href"); I'm sure $'(this).attr('href'); has a value.
[06:09:28] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/2420864
[06:09:38] <Acrack> can somebody tell me what is the difference between those 2 fonctions ? http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/14/ first one work but not the second one
[06:09:40] <px12> $(document).unbind('keydown'); removes all keydown handlers.. how do i remove only the one for spacebar?
[06:10:05] <FernandoBasso> I tried debugging with firebug, but newHash is always == "".
[06:10:22] <FernandoBasso> And indeed, all the links have class='case'.
[06:10:28] <cstanton> I am having a strange issue with "accordion"
[06:11:31] <collypops> px12, you can't unbind individual keys. all you can do is bind to the keydown event, and check which key was pressed by exploring the event object
[06:12:04] <cstanton> If I have a set of "tabs" created with ".tabs()", if the accordian is on the visible/active tab when the page is loaded, it behaves correctly. If it is on one of the "closed" tabs it does not display its body information properly
[06:12:21] <cstanton> Has anyone on the channel seen this sort of behaviour?
[06:12:25] <px12> collypops: i'd be happy to have an example code for that.
[06:14:23] <cstanton> For somereason the element height style does not get set above zero when an accordian element is activated if it had been created on a non-active tab when the page was loaded.
[06:14:57] <cstanton> Any ideas? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have the test site running on a public server if anyone would like a demo of the issue.
[06:14:59] <collypops> px12: the function you bind to the event is passed an argument (which is an instance of jQuery.Event)
[06:15:18] <saml> herror
[06:15:44] <px12> lemme do something with it.
[06:15:44] <collypops> px12: you can check that event.keyCode == 32
[06:15:51] <collypops> px12: that's a spacebar
[06:16:03] <px12> thanks
[06:16:06] <steveccc> cant the css selector > be used in jquery to just select the immediate child ie $('.menuparent>a').click(function(e)
[06:16:07] <`poo> cstanton: link
[06:17:32] <collypops> FernandoBasso: I think the problem you're having is because you can't assign any string to window.location.hash. It is restricted to alphanumeric keys, so URLs with : and / in them won't get assigned
[06:17:53] <`poo> steveccc: it's allowed
[06:18:04] <FernandoBasso> collypops: Also, I was refreshing the page, and the code is for a '.click' event.
[06:18:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: Sorry, had a panic call from a client!
[06:18:53] <FernandoBasso> collypops: Thanks for the info.
[06:18:54] <Acrack> ah ok ^^
[06:18:56] <steveccc> `poo: thanks - it seems to be ignoring the jquery and the immediate href is still clickable?
[06:19:10] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/17/ could you look at this please ?
[06:19:14] <`poo> steveccc: you're asking?
[06:19:28] <Acrack> my second $(this) doesn't seems to work
[06:19:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: Sure, give me a second
[06:19:58] <collypops> if you want to stop the link you're clicking on from causing the browser to navigate elsewhere, prevent its default action inside your event handler: event.preventDefault();
[06:20:00] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: i'm sure its a empty $(this) because of a new function
[06:20:10] <collypops> if you want to stop the link you're clicking on from causing the browser to navigate elsewhere, prevent its default action inside your event handler: event.preventDefault();
[06:20:30] <`poo> Acrack: what is that anonymous function doing there
[06:20:31] <swe_ET> or return false;
[06:20:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: I'm pretty sure you can't bind the same event on the same element twice, they would get in conflict
[06:21:12] <`poo> sure you can
[06:21:15] <collypops> ChrisTheSorcerer: Acrack: they don't conflict, they just both get applied
[06:21:41] <steveccc> `poo: I have an li with a class and under that an a href which I want to disable the link on - the following isnt removing the click action http://pastebin.com/frdgbaFk
[06:21:51] <Acrack> actually this is an ajax function
[06:21:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> collypops: That's what I mean with conflict, they would both get applied and you'd get unwanted results
[06:22:13] <Acrack> thing is
[06:22:15] <Acrack> if
[06:22:39] <Acrack> $('.answer-plus').prev('.answer-votes').html(answerrate);
[06:22:51] <Acrack> i got 6 everywhere... by click on one only
[06:22:59] <`poo> Acrack: you can't declare an anonymous function like that.........
[06:23:05] <Acrack> i can
[06:23:08] <Acrack> sec
[06:23:20] <collypops> ChrisTheSorcerer: Sorry, I would define 'conflict' as getting in the way of each other. In this case, they don't care about each other and are both executed in the order they were bounf
[06:23:26] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3816622
[06:23:34] <Acrack> look poo
[06:23:55] <`poo> like that you can, not like in your fiddle....
[06:24:02] <collypops> ChrisTheSorcerer: It's not always an unwanted result. It depends on the situation. In this case though, I doubt he/she wants it! haha
[06:24:12] <ChrisTheSorcerer> collypops: you're right, I thought the first one manipulated the same element, but it doesn't, it just sets both to answerid 6
[06:24:14] <`poo> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/18/
[06:24:33] <`poo> Acrack: check your browser's console for errors
[06:24:41] <`poo> (not in the new fiddle)
[06:24:44] <`poo> but generally
[06:25:32] <Oniklus> hello all. I have an add button in my jqgrid, but I want to return an error from the server if something goes wrong. how do I do this?
[06:25:39] <collypops> Acrack: if you're checking your browser's console for errors, ensure you're looking at the output from the Result pane. Chrome lets you switch which <iframe> you get output from.
[06:26:01] <`poo> huh how?
[06:26:05] <`poo> oh i see
[06:26:05] <px12> collypops: what should i do inside if(event.keyCode==32){ to stop it from doing anything?
[06:26:07] <collypops> Oniklus, which ajax method are you using?
[06:26:10] <Acrack> i don't get any errore guy
[06:26:11] <Acrack> z
[06:26:21] <collypops> px12: yes
[06:26:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/19/
[06:26:22] <`poo> Acrack: in the fiddle you pasted
[06:26:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> since you can't declar anon functions like that
[06:26:44] <px12> collypops: what should i do inside it?
[06:26:45] <Acrack> {"answerRate":1}
[06:26:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I just made a separate function of it ;)
[06:27:06] <`poo> the name is the issue
[06:27:23] <collypops> px12: this should help: http://jquerybyexample.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-to-disable-spacebar-in-text-box.html
[06:28:02] <px12> i tried it already but it didn't do the job :/
[06:28:07] <collypops> px12: you want to call preventDefault() on the event object to stop the default behaviour
[06:28:23] <Acrack> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://pastie.org/3816622 did you check this mate ?
[06:28:29] <Oniklus> collypops: not sure what you mean. $().jqGrid({ //properties });
[06:28:49] <px12> collypop: it didn't work.
[06:29:42] <px12> collypops: actually is there a way to not do ANYTHING at all if spacebar is pressed except doing what it is intended to do, that is adding white spaces?
[06:29:50] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Acrack: I think you need to rethink that this-declaration there... Are you sure the AJAX returns the object you think it does?
[06:30:03] <Acrack> it does return it
[06:30:04] <swe_ET> px12: return false, tried that?
[06:30:09] <Acrack> as a proof that it is working
[06:30:25] <`poo> change $(this) to valuer
[06:30:29] <Acrack> i replace $(this) by $('.answer-votes)
[06:30:30] <px12> swe_ET: yeah.. doesn't work. :/
[06:30:34] <collypops> Oniklus: ah you're not making the server call yourself. the plugin is doing it for you. I'm not sure how you'd catch errors then
[06:30:34] <Acrack> and all get replaced
[06:30:42] <Acrack> so we indeed enter in that function
[06:30:51] <`poo> Acrack: change $(this) to valuer, inside the ajax callback
[06:31:01] <Oniklus> collypops; yes, that's right. ok, thanks for your help
[06:31:07] <Acrack> poo ?
[06:31:07] <collypops> you can bind to the 'global' ajax error event
[06:31:14] <`poo> oh sorry
[06:31:18] <collypops> then you just check that the URL matches your server resource
[06:31:27] <`poo> Acrack: save $(this) before the ajax call
[06:31:38] <Acrack> `poo: i don't understand what u meant
[06:31:45] <collypops> Oniklus, have a look at this: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[06:32:01] <px12> ?
[06:32:17] <collypops> bind that event to $("body") and you can hook into any ajax error in your page
[06:32:42] <Acrack> `poo: ah ok sec
[06:33:15] <`poo> Acrack: http://pastebin.com/j4PxFaaD
[06:33:30] <`poo> er
[06:33:52] <`poo> this: http://pastebin.com/hXCwwiDj
[06:35:26] <Acrack> ok lemme try :p
[06:36:08] <Acrack> perfect guyz
[06:36:09] <Acrack> thanks a lot
[06:37:36] <`poo> Acrack: remember that if you are in a new/different function (even an internal anonymous one) then 'this' might not be what it was outside that function
[06:41:03] <Wiggin> Hiya
[06:43:54] <Acrack> `poo: http://pastie.org/3816744
[06:44:15] <Acrack> `poo i did same functions
[06:44:19] <Acrack> but minus one doesn't work
[06:44:27] <Acrack> am i doing this right ?
[06:44:45] <sarsntony> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10224184/jqueryui-for-rails3-assets
[06:44:52] <sarsntony> anbody familiar with assets/jqueryUI problem?
[06:45:15] <`poo> Acrack: it looks ok....
[06:45:20] <Acrack> ^^ wierd
[06:45:38] <Acrack> and i get JSON answer with the value of answerRate ^^
[06:45:46] <Acrack> wich -1
[06:46:02] <`poo> are you sure that .prev() is what you want also in the minus button?
[06:47:06] <shmup> if i'm doing a .each on a table based on a td class, say .foo
[06:47:16] <shmup> how can i look at the prev .foo
[06:47:57] <`poo> $(this).prev('.foo') ?
[06:48:09] <shmup> i'll try that hah, i tried something similar
[06:48:14] <djbokkeman_> Hi! In a jquery.each I'm making an array. it looks like [value1, value2, value3, value4] in the console. But when i push it out of the function i get [value1, value2, value3, value4] on a new line. I need it to be separated like this [value1, value2, value3, value4],[value1, value2, value3, value4],[value1, value2, value3, value4]
[06:48:27] <Acrack> sec
[06:48:40] <djbokkeman_> so [],[],[],[]
[06:48:45] <`poo> huh?
[06:48:50] <`poo> one array or 4?
[06:48:59] <djbokkeman_> 4
[06:49:12] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/20/
[06:49:13] <`poo> problem is?
[06:49:24] <Acrack> plus is working, minus isn't working dunno why ^^
[06:49:40] <`poo> Acrack: .prev() is wrong in the minus
[06:50:01] <`poo> read .prev() docs
[06:50:42] <djbokkeman_> well I'm generating this in a .each function. and each [1,2,3,4] it generates it needs to be separated out of the function like this [1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]
[06:50:49] <shmup> `poo: alert($(this).prev('.xmldata').val());
[06:50:57] <`poo> separated out of the function?
[06:50:57] <shmup> alerts undefined, so
[06:51:09] <djbokkeman_> yes
[06:51:10] <Trisox> (   . )_( .   )
[06:51:12] <shmup> hm that does seem like it'd work
[06:51:19] <`poo> shmup: see ?demo
[06:51:20] <bot-t> shmup, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:51:23] <`poo> o
[06:52:00] <`poo> djbokkeman_ you need to re-explain your problem so that someone can understand what you want without knowing it in advance.
[06:52:33] <`poo> or better yet jsfiddle your problem
[06:52:46] <djbokkeman_> i will jsfiddle it.
[06:53:35] <Wiggin> sarsntony: the other parts of jqueryui work?
[06:53:45] <sarsntony> I believe not
[06:53:59] <sarsntony> I tried copy pasting the script portion of index.html
[06:54:06] <sarsntony> (the one you get when you download jqueryUI)
[06:54:09] <sarsntony> and none of those worked
[06:54:15] <Wiggin> hmm
[06:54:25] <ruby_on_tails> hello guys
[06:54:32] <ruby_on_tails> i just thought i will say a hello
[06:54:37] <sarsntony> not sure if it's assets pipeline doing some stupid garbage..
[06:54:56] <Wiggin> umm I have no idea whether this is the problem, but the javascript might not have loaded yet
[06:55:01] <Wiggin> use $(document).ready
[06:55:22] <Wiggin> or is $( a shortcut for that
[06:55:40] <Wiggin> ah it is
[06:55:42] <sarsntony> !topic
[06:55:47] <shmup> `poo: http://jsfiddle.net/JtHDv/
[06:55:55] <sarsntony> so, no need for document.ready
[06:55:58] <sarsntony> right?
[06:56:08] <Wiggin> yup
[06:56:16] <Acrack> poo : $(this).closest('.test').find('.answer-rate').html(answerrate); i used this instead of prev ^^
[06:56:24] <djbokkeman_> http://jsfiddle.net/a92B6/
[06:56:30] <Wiggin> so even if you have the html hardcoded to include the javascript files, it still doesn't work?
[06:56:53] <sarsntony> well the html already has the javascript files written in
[06:57:12] <sarsntony> it has the weird ?body=1 or w/e
[06:57:29] <Wiggin> but that shouldn't affect it..
[06:57:32] <sarsntony> <script src="/assets/jquery-ui-1.8.19.custom.min.js?body=1" type="text/javascript">  </script>
[06:57:33] <sarsntony> yeah
[06:57:38] <`poo> shmup: you want .text()
[06:57:46] <Wiggin> unless your web server does something with it
[06:57:53] <zatan> Hi I am learning jquery, is there any better way to write this code ? As its look that I am repeating all the same
[06:57:54] <zatan> http://jsfiddle.net/BUq6n/
[06:58:00] <djbokkeman_> poo could you take a look at my jsfiddle ?
[06:58:00] <gho5t> in some code I found a function called init. above it I see this: $(init); what does this do?
[06:58:02] <sarsntony> I'm pretty sure ?body=1 won't affect it..
[06:58:16] <Parhs> hello guys.. http://parhs.no-ip.org  i have there a left navigation.. the problem is that when aboutus expands and services then expand the bar at right remains at wrong position..
[06:58:18] <Parhs>  $("#main-menu-wrapper .top-menu  .sub-menu").stop().hide(0,function(){
[06:58:18] <Parhs>                     $("#main-menu-wrapper .bar").css("top" ,$(this).parent().position().top + 10);
[06:58:26] <Parhs> isnt always updated to correct value
[06:58:38] <gho5t> sarsntony: use .toggle
[06:58:45] <sarsntony> ?
[06:58:55] <`poo> djbokkeman_: i'm looking at it. now what?
[06:59:03] <sarsntony> a bit more clarification on .toggle please.
[06:59:05] <shmup> `poo: it's not like that was the only problem though. that was just the obvious one. ;P
[06:59:21] <gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[06:59:28] <`poo> shmup: ok ;p
[06:59:31] <djbokkeman_> poo you have a suggestion how i can sepereat each [] by a comma ?
[06:59:38] <djbokkeman_> as output ?
[06:59:43] <`poo> what [] ?
[07:00:48] <shmup> `poo: it seems like i have to use the previous index
[07:01:01] <djbokkeman_> can you see the difference between //This is the output i need. and //This is the output that it wil generate ?
[07:01:04] <`poo> djbokkeman_:  someArray.join(', ')
[07:01:20] <djbokkeman_> poo thanks
[07:01:37] <`poo> shmup: ok ;p
[07:01:54] <shmup> ah yes, .index() - 1
[07:02:18] <Wiggin> oh sarsntony
[07:02:22] <sarsntony> yeah?
[07:02:28] <Wiggin> you said that javascript is in /assets/javascript
[07:02:32] <sarsntony> yes
[07:02:34] <`poo> shmup: why .index() ?
[07:02:41] <Wiggin> but the scripts are imported from /assets/
[07:02:51] <Wiggin> "/assets/jquery.js?body=1"
[07:02:59] <Wiggin> should it be "/assets/javascript/jquery.js?body=1" ?
[07:03:19] <sarsntony> I can still access
[07:03:22] <gho5t> in some code I found a function called init. above it I see this: $(init); what does this do?
[07:03:22] <sarsntony> the javascript
[07:03:24] <sarsntony> via /evaluation_instances/1
[07:03:28] <sarsntony> oh I mean
[07:03:31] <sarsntony> http://0.0.0.0:3000/assets/jquery-ui-1.8.19.custom.min.js?body=1
[07:03:58] <gho5t> zatan: use toggle
[07:03:59] <Wiggin> I'll assume you can see it
[07:04:00] <Wiggin> >.>
[07:04:02] <sarsntony> [I thought that was the issue as well]
[07:04:08] <sarsntony> u want a screenshot? lol
[07:04:13] <gho5t> sorry sarsntony toggle was for someone else
[07:04:20] <sarsntony> yeah I thought so..
[07:04:23] <zatan> gho5t,  cheers i will look it
[07:04:24] <sarsntony> didn't really make sense, lol
[07:04:30] <gho5t> lol
[07:06:12] <djbokkeman_> foo .join is removing the []
[07:06:38] <djbokkeman_> i want to add a comma after "[]" so it looks like "[],"
[07:07:11] <Tasser> I'd like something that's on the bottom of the page, but sticks if you scroll, but only the top part ( 20% )
[07:09:18] <misutowolf> So, I'm having a bit of a problem with this page I'm working on (prototype), anyone care to take a look at it?
[07:09:25] <Nece228> how to disable links
[07:09:35] <misutowolf> I know I'm not traversing the DOM tree like I need to to get the effect taht I want, but I'm sorta not sure how I should do it:
[07:09:37] <Nece228> i mean i could click them but the shouldnt link to webpage
[07:09:50] <Wiggin> Nece228: href="#" ?
[07:10:08] <Nece228> not what im searching for
[07:10:13] <Nece228> i still need link data
[07:10:22] <Nece228> but i dont want to open it webpage
[07:10:23] <Wiggin> ah so it doesn't actually load the page?
[07:10:40] <Wiggin> uh bind a click event to the link and use preventDefault
[07:10:44] <Nece228> when i press on link it should execute jquery function not open the link
[07:11:06] <misutowolf> http://remnant-gaming.net/a3dev/window-prototype.html
[07:11:12] <`poo> djbokkeman_: just use $.each and you can format it however you like
[07:11:18] <beancurd> href = '#' onClick="jsFuction()"
[07:11:26] <Wiggin> Nece228: just $("a .selectorclass").preventDefault()
[07:11:48] <misutowolf> I now realize that I can't use .next() to get what I want, but I'm not sure how to navigate the DOM tree properly to get the intended DIV selected for the .click() thing
[07:12:10] <Wiggin> sarsntony: I have no idea what's wrong
[07:12:21] <FernandoBasso> I am using hash-change plugin, and I have a little piece of code that should smoothly scroll back to top. It works if I open the files themselves, then it works. It is the code on line 59: https://gist.github.com/2420864
[07:12:28] <sarsntony> yeah.. this sucks :/
[07:12:33] <misutowolf> i'd have to up to the parent, then the sibling of the parent, THEN down to the div i want, I think
[07:12:39] <Wiggin> you're sure jqueryui is being loaded?
[07:12:48] <sarsntony> jquery is, for sure
[07:12:51] <sarsntony> jqueryui, not sure
[07:12:58] <sarsntony> [I think that's the problem]
[07:13:03] <Wiggin> what's jquery_ujs?
[07:13:29] <sarsntony> rails speciailty again
[07:14:40] <Wiggin> buh?
[07:14:52] <FernandoBasso> I mean, if the new url is provide by the plugin, then clicking the "Topo" link doesn't work.
[07:14:55] <Wiggin> is rails modifying the javascript files?
[07:16:28] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/BadSites/intro.htm <-- If someone wants to take a look.
[07:16:44] <FernandoBasso> html*
[07:17:14] <gho5t> in some code I found a function called init. above it I see this: $(init); what does this do?
[07:18:24] <`poo> creates a jquery object witih whatever init returns
[07:18:31] <`poo> ah no.
[07:18:35] <`poo> SRY
[07:18:42] <gho5t> IS OK
[07:19:02] <gho5t> is it a shortcut for calling init() on document load?
[07:19:09] <gho5t> doc ready
[07:19:20] <`poo> oh
[07:19:26] <`poo> yes, of course ;)
[07:19:40] <gho5t> ...
[07:19:51] <gho5t> that was a test
[07:20:01] <`poo> wat
[07:20:12] <gho5t> wrapping something in jquery doesn't make it automatically call it on dom ready
[07:20:26] <`poo> go back to the test part
[07:20:32] <gho5t> ok
[07:20:32] <myusuf3_> i am looking got a good cookie plugin for jquery
[07:20:34] <myusuf3_> thoughts?
[07:20:40] <Nece228> how to select certain attribute in certain id
[07:20:45] <gho5t> i'm back there now
[07:20:48] <myusuf3_> I am taking a look at https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[07:20:51] <Nece228> $('#links,a[href]') this is invalid
[07:20:52] <myusuf3_> but the tests are failing
[07:21:22] <`poo> gho5t: hi from here
[07:21:34] <gho5t> but srsly you guys
[07:21:44] <gho5t> what would $(init) do to a function called init()
[07:21:50] <`poo> call it on dom ready..
[07:22:03] <`poo> just like $(function() { ... })
[07:22:08] <`poo> calls that anonymous function on dom readty
[07:22:20] <myusuf3_> anyone/
[07:22:24] <`poo> like you said, it's a short cut for $(document).ready
[07:23:06] <gho5t> you mean $(function(){ ... }) (jQuery));
[07:23:14] <`poo> no, i dont
[07:23:24] <gho5t> can you point to some documentation
[07:23:33] <`poo> yes http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[07:23:38] <gho5t> here we go
[07:23:39] <`poo> see jQuery(callback)  version
[07:23:42] <gho5t> ok
[07:24:19] <gho5t> gotcha
[07:24:21] <gho5t> thanks man
[07:24:34] <`poo> ok you passed
[07:24:39] <`poo> np
[07:24:47] <gho5t> you too
[07:24:52] <`poo> tnx bro
[07:24:53] <gho5t> double test just happened in here ppl
[07:25:04] <gho5t> remember this day
[07:25:12] <`poo> i will avenge.
[07:26:23] <Nece228> whats the correct syntax for this
[07:26:24] <Nece228> $('#links,a[href]')
[07:26:45] <Nece228> i want to select link url which are in #links id
[07:27:32] <myusuf3_> hmm
[07:27:42] <gho5t> use .attr
[07:27:54] <gho5t> $("#links a").attr("href");
[07:28:02] <Nece228> ah thanks
[07:30:09] <Nece228> hmm doesnt work
[07:30:13] <Nece228> need to examine
[07:30:30] <Acrack> how to stop a function if another one is already started ?
[07:31:05] <`poo> Acrack: you don't
[07:31:24] <mattyh88> can i add an eventlistener (change) on a hidden input field?
[07:31:33] <`poo> yes
[07:32:16] <zivester> is there a way to load a page's HTML into a div with ajax?  say load google.com into #mydiv ?
[07:32:17] <mattyh88> okay thx .. will search some more to solve my problem then .. :p
[07:32:25] <Wiggin> zivester: .load
[07:32:48] <Wiggin> or for your example, #("#mydiv").load("http://google.com");
[07:32:53] <Wiggin> ?load
[07:32:53] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:33:00] <Wiggin> huh
[07:33:01] <Wiggin> the other one
[07:33:12] <Wiggin> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:33:30] <Caribou|> hello, i'm having an issue with jquery ui i'm playing with droppable & draggable but the drop event in my case is not triggered once i'm trying to move elements from the second list > http://jsfiddle.net/cG3NK/
[07:33:46] <Acrack> lemme explain u my weird problem, for exemple i want to delete and comment, so i click in the "X", so during the suppression instead of "X" we see a loading.gif, but i have another function that refresh comment list every 5seconds, so that function will overwrite the existing list and stop the loading.gif, the comment will still get deleted thaught.
[07:33:59] <zivester> Wiggin: http://jsfiddle.net/LtgR8/  doesn't work?
[07:34:16] <FernandoBasso> In jQuery, can I have a click event attached to things that are not anchors, like, a paragraph, for instance?
[07:34:26] <`poo> Acrack: then have that other function NOT do what you dont want it to do
[07:34:28] <johnkpaul> FernandoBasso: yes, that is probably the more common use case
[07:34:31] <StevenCodes> FernandoBasso,  Yeah
[07:34:32] <`poo> instead of 'stopping' it
[07:34:36] <StevenCodes> ^^ :p
[07:34:50] <Wiggin> zivester: oh yeah you can only call from the same domain due to security restrictions
[07:34:54] <Wiggin> :P
[07:35:03] <Wiggin> same origin policy
[07:35:15] <Wiggin> to prevent XSS
[07:35:16] <Wiggin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[07:35:20] <Acrack> `poo i don't understand you :s
[07:35:35] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/BadSites/intro.html#intro.html <-- Then why isn't this working? If I click "topo", nothing happens....
[07:36:02] <`poo> FernandoBasso: asking questions like that here is the best way NOT to learn jquery
[07:36:10] <`poo> (sorry i was scrolled up)
[07:36:35] <zivester> so does this only work because this site has somehow allowed it? http://jsfiddle.net/LtgR8/1/
[07:36:36] <`poo> Acrack: you can have a global flag variable that tells that refresh function if it should refresh...........
[07:36:45] <`poo> Acrack: or whatever. if you want more help fiddle it
[07:37:09] <johnkpaul> FernandoBasso: because you're already scrolled to the top of the page
[07:37:59] <FernandoBasso> johnkpaul: But even when I scroll down a little again, and try the button, it just doesn't go to top.
[07:38:30] <Caribou|> woahhh that's stupid, i was trying to use a drop event on a draggable object, allright sorry :)
[07:38:31] <`poo> didn't we fix this yesterday ; (
[07:38:37] <johnkpaul> FernandoBasso: scrollTop isn't a css property you can animate
[07:38:56] <FernandoBasso> The problem is when I have, for instance, intro.html#intro.html (done by the hashchange plugin).
[07:39:02] <Acrack> `poo do you have exemple of that flag thingy ?
[07:40:12] <`poo> Acrack:  var doRefresh = true;
[07:40:48] <FernandoBasso> johnkpaul: When my url ends with intro.html (without #intro.html added), then it works.
[07:41:16] <johnkpaul> oh I see, I'm wrong, you can animate that way, I didn't realize
[07:41:30] <FernandoBasso> No problem.
[07:41:52] <FernandoBasso> Bad communication from my part, sorry.
[07:42:09] <Acrack> `poo so for exemple when my suppresion start i put var doRefresh = false, then at the end of it var doRefresh = true, and in refresh function i put condition if doRefresh is true or false do this or that right ?
[07:42:22] <`poo> yep
[07:42:44] <johnkpaul> so span.topo isn't a link, and shouldn't change the hash
[07:42:45] <Acrack> ok thanks gonna try it now
[07:42:50] <johnkpaul> how do you get to #intro.html, FernandoBasso
[07:43:33] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/2420864 <-- johnkpaul
[07:43:42] <FernandoBasso> The first half of the code.
[07:44:31] <shmup> `poo: any clue why this doesn't see '2'
[07:44:32] <shmup> http://jsfiddle.net/JtHDv/2/
[07:44:36] <johnkpaul> that's not the code that's on the page you linked, FernandoBasso
[07:44:38] <johnkpaul> it's slightly different
[07:45:11] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/2420864
[07:45:19] <FernandoBasso> I've just pasted this new one, then.
[07:46:18] <johnkpaul> so FernandoBasso, it has something to do with the page loading
[07:46:23] <johnkpaul> does span.topo get recreated somehow?
[07:46:36] <johnkpaul> ah yes, you have a .load()
[07:46:51] <johnkpaul> FernandoBasso: when you attach an event handler to an element, it's only attached to that element
[07:47:02] <johnkpaul> when you remove all of that html, and load new html, that event handler is no longer in place
[07:47:26] <johnkpaul> so you need to use something like delegate, or, preferrably, on
[07:47:28] <johnkpaul> ?on
[07:47:28] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:47:30] <johnkpaul> ?delegate
[07:47:30] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:47:43] <johnkpaul> delegate will be deprecated eventually, so learn how to use on in a similar fashion
[07:47:59] <PeeterWork> Hello
[07:48:06] <PeeterWork> Im running into an issue with jquery.ajax
[07:48:25] <Ste_uk> why is live deprecated and delegated not already? whats the live function main issue?
[07:48:27] <PeeterWork> Im loading some html into a div tag, the html includes script tags
[07:48:28] <FernandoBasso> johnkpaul: You mean, instead of my ('span.topo').click... stuff?
[07:48:33] <johnkpaul> FernandoBasso: yes
[07:48:35] <Ste_uk> the fact it watches the DOM all the time?
[07:48:49] <johnkpaul> Ste_uk: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[07:48:49] <FernandoBasso> johnkpaul: All right. Thanks. I'll what I can come up with.
[07:48:51] <shmup> that jsfiddle was not right heh
[07:48:57] <johnkpaul> no problem, FernandoBasso
[07:49:33] <Acrack> `poo http://pastie.org/3817075 this isn't working im doing it wrong for sure could check lines : 2 , 130 , 148 , 160 please
[07:49:41] <johnkpaul> Ste_uk: I think that live is being deprecated because it is preferred to use .on() to achieve the same a/effect, I don't know why that is
[07:49:55] <johnkpaul> affect or effect, I can never remember
[07:53:12] <misutowolf> So, I'm having a bit of a problem with this page I'm working on (prototype), anyone care to take a look at it?   I need to modify how it's looking for the class to toggle, because obviously next() won't work:
[07:53:14] <misutowolf> http://remnant-gaming.net/a3dev/window-prototype.html
[07:54:52] <px_> heya.. see i have this $('#md-event .event-name').click(function() {...... now what i'm trying to do is do this manually.. like there's some element '#x' and its class is event-name, now i want to trigger the click manually.. something like $('#x').click(); and on this i want the $('#md-event .event-name').click(function() { to trigger.. any ideas how i could do this?
[07:55:14] <mattyh88> hi, why isn't 'testing' being displayed in an alert box? http://jsfiddle.net/cWHqK/
[07:56:18] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: programmatically changing the value does not trigger the change event
[07:56:26] <mattyh88> ah
[07:56:35] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/cWHqK/1/
[07:56:37] <johnkpaul> @ mattyh88
[07:56:49] <px_> yo? :P
[07:56:50] <mattyh88> okay thx !
[07:57:06] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @px_
[07:57:07] <bot-t> px_, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:57:38] <px_> lemme try that.
[07:57:56] <johnkpaul> px_: you can alsotake a look at the example I just sent mattyh88
[07:58:02] <johnkpaul> it uses trigger in a similar fashion to what you need
[07:58:09] <px_> okay. thanks :)
[07:58:13] <johnkpaul> n
[07:58:14] <johnkpaul> p
[07:58:23] <johnkpaul> misutowolf: can you please make a jsfiddle of your problem
[07:58:26] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @misutowolf
[07:58:27] <bot-t> misutowolf, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[08:00:02] <misutowolf> Alright, gimme a minute.
[08:01:19] <PeeterWork> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10230945/jquery-ajax-loading-scripts-in-wrong-order
[08:02:16] <px_> johnkpaul: according to that, calling $('#x').trigger("click"); should be equal to clicking on the div with class 'xyz' whose click handler is $('.xyz').click(function(){..... right? but this doesn't work :/
[08:03:06] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/4u9HG/
[08:03:07] <misutowolf> though
[08:03:27] <misutowolf> it doesn't seem to be rendering the page properly (bottom bar isn't there, and it's not loading the button that's supposed to be clicked?)
[08:03:42] <px_> johnkpaul??
[08:03:46] <PeeterWork> MissionCritical
[08:03:55] <PeeterWork> misutowolf
[08:03:56] <PeeterWork> $(this).next(".thecontent")
[08:04:03] <PeeterWork> .next wont find the next .thecontent
[08:04:16] <PeeterWork> it will look IF the next element is a .thecontent
[08:04:32] <misutowolf> yeah, i know, i said that, i guess i need to navigate up the tree then back down and shit
[08:05:10] <misutowolf> I just have little to no experience with DOM, this is my first real attempt at screwing with jQuery, so yeah.
[08:05:18] <misutowolf> But yeah, I need to find the next ".thecontent"
[08:05:20] <misutowolf> that's the goal
[08:05:38] <PeeterWork> .closest(".postcontainer").next().toggle()
[08:06:30] <johnkpaul> px_: equivalent with respect to the handlers that have been added using jquery
[08:06:52] <johnkpaul> $('#md-event .event-name').trigger("click")
[08:07:10] <johnkpaul> px_:  $("#x").click(function(){$('#md-event .event-name').trigger("click")})
[08:07:23] <johnkpaul> this isn't really the best way to thandle this though, px_
[08:07:40] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/26/ why this code is working only if i delete 3 last line of javascript ?????
[08:07:43] <johnkpaul> why not pass the same handler function to $("#x") as you did to #md-event
[08:08:34] <andrew9183> Acrack: what do you mean? it works for me.
[08:08:53] <Acrack> unscomment
[08:08:58] <Acrack> the 3 last lines
[08:09:02] <Acrack> and tell me if it works
[08:09:03] <px_> johnkpaul: actually i dont think i described myself properly. :P see.. $('#md-event .event-name').click(func.... in this it has somewhere $(this).attr('id')... so do you think it will still get the id if i call it from inside $("#x").click(function(){$('#md-event .event-name').trigger("click")}) ?
[08:09:03] <andrew9183> Acrack: you are missing ); from your document.ready
[08:09:24] <andrew9183> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/27/
[08:09:25] <Acrack> oh yea
[08:09:27] <Acrack> lool
[08:09:28] <johnkpaul> ?tias @ px_
[08:09:28] <bot-t> px_, Try It And See
[08:09:33] <andrew9183> are you new? LOL jk
[08:09:48] <px_> bot-t, are you a bot or 'what'? :P
[08:09:49] <bot-t> px_, Outlook not so good.
[08:10:20] <misutowolf> ...hmmmmmmm
[08:10:31] <misutowolf> it's still not working properly.
[08:10:54] <misutowolf> i replaced that line with:
[08:10:56] <misutowolf> $(this).closest(".contentcontainer").next(".thecontent").toggle() <--
[08:11:05] <misutowolf> err
[08:11:08] <misutowolf> that's still wrong
[08:11:10] <misutowolf> never mind
[08:12:16] <px_> ohh.. i didn't had to do anything else :P simple $("#"+hash_sp[1]).trigger("click"); did the trick.. i figured out i wasn't giving this select "#" so it wasn't working and now its working great :D thanks :)
[08:12:25] <px_> johnkpaul: ^^
[08:12:56] <johnkpaul> no problem, px_
[08:13:10] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/28/ how to stop the function loadChirps to execute ? i tried this but...
[08:13:38] <misutowolf> it's not even registering the button click
[08:15:35] <gho5t> i forget - which is faster: $("#foo").find("a") or $("a", "#foo") ?
[08:16:34] <burlyscudd> I'm hoping someone can help me understand some jQuery behavior.  I have a form that I AJAX load into a jQuery UI dialog.  The idea is that the user fills out the form and hits "OK"  the dialog lives in the DOM so that a subsequent need to alter the form doesn't require another AJAX load.  My problem is that the values I put into textarea elements aren't respected.  They stay as the default values that the form has when it's loaded
[08:17:23] <mehale> how can I find the first radiobutton in a fieldset which is not disabled? $('fieldset.f_whatFieldset input[disabled=false]:first '); //does not do it
[08:18:18] <wodemaye__> Cork, are you there?
[08:18:35] <wodemaye__> do you have that last link I gave you? my comop crashed and i lost it :(
[08:21:36] <wodemaye__> has anyone on here been in the chan for the last 6-7 hours?
[08:22:26] <jwg2s> hey all, can anyone help me with a login slide bar question?  it's about shifting content downward smoothly
[08:23:11] <misutowolf> This sucks.   For some reason, clicking the image that's supposed to be triggering this event isn't even triggering at all.   I was trying to debug and stuck an alert() in the function that's supposed to do this toggle() stuff and it's just not happening.
[08:23:34] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/4u9HG/ <-- That's what I'm working on (i fixed the toggle() line, I think, so ignore that)
[08:25:12] <misutowolf> it's just reacting to button clicks at all, i don't know why
[08:27:18] <IconicSchema> misutowolf: your trying to traverse up then to a sibling then to a descendant with next()
[08:27:53] <IconicSchema> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[08:27:55] <misutowolf> IconicSchema: I said ignore that, I fixed it.  My problem now is the .click() not even registering.  The alert doesn't even come up when I click the image it's supposed to work on
[08:28:01] <PeeterWork> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10230945/jquery-ajax-loading-scripts-in-wrong-order
[08:28:13] <misutowolf> I fixed the traversal thing, I think, but I can't test it if it won't even register the .click :x
[08:29:01] <IconicSchema> click registers fine here
[08:29:06] <misutowolf> huh
[08:29:08] <IconicSchema> http://jsfiddle.net/kwilliams_texstarweb/4u9HG/1/
[08:29:45] <misutowolf> I wonder if it's my browser, but I wouldn't think
[08:30:07] <IconicSchema> the .minbutton only exists in your top container
[08:30:59] <misutowolf> hm
[08:33:07] <Cork[home]> misutowolf: side note, when your pasting things in the html secion of jsfiddle, only include the body section
[08:33:34] <IconicSchema> ^ jsfiddle lets you load external resources too
[08:34:01] <Acrack> can some help me with this little code ? how to make loadChirps function start again : http://jsfiddle.net/vn4n4/29/
[08:34:50] <IconicSchema> IE9 doesn't support drag/drop uploading?
[08:36:06] <Cork[home]> the d&d upload needs the File api, and i don't think ie has that
[08:36:24] <take_it_t> can anyone suggest an efficient way of constantly computing and checking for changes to a particular attribute of an element, for example the body width?
[08:37:07] <sphinxxx> take_it_t:  you can check it in a setInterval
[08:37:55] <take_it_t> sphinxxx: that was my first thought, but surely there's already an active run loop or something that would be more efficient
[08:38:05] <Cork[home]> Acrack: you want the if statement inside the timer
[08:38:14] <sphinxxx> not really, unless theres an event that is triggered from the change
[08:38:19] <sphinxxx> like when the window is resized
[08:38:53] <natrixnatrix89> hi guys.. I've been desperately fighting with this one and don't know what's the problem..
[08:39:10] <natrixnatrix89> whenever I load my iframe and it loads jquery
[08:39:15] <IconicSchema> if you want to deal with resize go this route: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[08:39:15] <natrixnatrix89> I get the following error: Permission denied to access property 'nodeType'
[08:39:31] <Cork[home]> natrixnatrix89: what element?
[08:39:44] <Cork[home]> or just when it loads?
[08:39:54] <natrixnatrix89> just when I load
[08:39:58] <natrixnatrix89> On all pages
[08:40:07] <natrixnatrix89> when it inits jquery
[08:40:12] <Cork[home]> you have a link?
[08:40:25] <natrixnatrix89> error is on jquery line 108
[08:40:32] <natrixnatrix89>         if ( selector.nodeType ) {
[08:40:39] <tomasm-> hi, how can i tell whether a click event happened outside of a container or not? I want to react to a click event only when it's outside of the container, ie to hide the container
[08:41:07] <natrixnatrix89> a link.. well then I'd need your facebook account, because its an app in sandbox mode in facebook
[08:41:27] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: you listen for a click on the document, and check if its from that element
[08:41:28] <natrixnatrix89> and As I understand permission denied means that the domains do not match
[08:41:39] <Cork[home]> or you can block clicks from bubbling past the container
[08:41:41] <natrixnatrix89> but on chrome it works just fine
[08:41:57] <natrixnatrix89> but in FF I get this error and jquery doesn't work
[08:42:38] <Cork[home]> natrixnatrix89: its impossible to say without seeing the page in action
[08:43:09] <natrixnatrix89> ok. can you give me your facebook id, so I can add you as tester please?
[08:43:41] <Cork[home]> don't have one :)
[08:43:57] <IconicSchema> natrixnatrix89: try checking if nodeType is undefined first
[08:44:16] <Cork[home]> natrixnatrix89: but your doing some form of selection, else that line wouldn't be hit
[08:44:34] <Cork[home]> that section is for $() wrapping dom elements
[08:44:36] <natrixnatrix89> nope. the error is on jquery init
[08:44:42] <Cork[home]> so ex your doing $(document).ready
[08:45:07] <Cork[home]> might be facebook replaces the document object
[08:45:10] <natrixnatrix89> yeah
[08:45:13] <natrixnatrix89> maybe
[08:45:27] <Cork[home]> and if it does, you can't work with the dom
[08:45:32] <natrixnatrix89> ok. I'll replae $(document).ready with facebook init
[08:45:43] <natrixnatrix89> thanks for the advice!
[08:45:45] <zerobeholder> I did think about this before coming back. These elements have two classes applied, .separatediv and !lowercase-person-name-a-through-z. I have tried googling various combinations of jquery, regex, match, class, and other less useful terms. Time to beg for smarter people to point me in the direction of enlightenment.
[08:46:02] <zerobeholder> http://pastebin.com/4JvADzXH
[08:46:38] <natrixnatrix89> http://pastebin.com/pmn4W5tz
[08:46:38] <natrixnatrix89> here's the jquery part for my issue
[08:46:48] <zerobeholder> I am trying to show a display:none; div based on a regex with the value of a text box.
[08:47:07] <zerobeholder> *divs, plural
[08:47:40] <nFFF> >eval var s = '!lowercase-person-name-a-through-z'; s.match(/^!.*/);
[08:47:49] <nFFF> ?eval var s = '!lowercase-person-name-a-through-z'; s.match(/^!.*/);
[08:47:50] <bot-t> nFFF: ["!lowercase-person-name-a-through-z"]
[08:48:23] <nFFF> zerobeholder what are you trying to do?
[08:49:42] <zerobeholder> There is a text input. I .hide() all the divs, then I want to .show() the divs that match the value in the text box in part or whole.
[08:50:15] <zerobeholder> somebody said use indexOf, but I have only used that on arrays...
[08:50:41] <zoned> .
[08:51:00] <nFFF> 'the divs that match the value in the text box in part or whole.' -> you want the value to match the div's class?
[08:51:08] <zerobeholder> the exclamation point in the class is just there because none of my other divs begin with an exclamation point. correct.
[08:51:42] <zoned> vernondotjpg, is so cool!
[08:52:00] <zerobeholder> o in the text box should match Cork, zerobeholder, bot-t, and zoned-- but not nFFF...
[08:52:05] <vernondotjpg> zoned, is so 90's
[08:52:32] <zerobeholder> ro should only match zeRObeholder... and so on
[08:52:51] <gho5t> in a widget I see a dev is setting variables without declaring them e.g. x = "foo" with no preceding var. Isn't this creating global variables?
[08:53:13] <zerobeholder> I add a class based on lowercase ! + firstname + lastname
[08:53:21] <MeXTuX> I have a div with two hidden fields and I'm executing this $(this).closest('div.container').find('input[type=hidden]').val(); How many fields is this statement retrieving??? Only one or two??
[08:54:16] <zerobeholder> so, I am just not sure how to select elements based on the regex-- it could as easily be plain substring matching in a string. I would happily ditch the regex as long as the end result worked.
[08:54:24] <nFFF> zerobeholder
[08:54:24] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/4rexm/
[08:54:29] <nFFF> you dont need any regex
[08:54:36] <nFFF> or moreso so little its not even regex
[08:54:38] <motaka2> why $('#divContent').width() is equal to the window width?
[08:54:50] <nFFF> your just trying to match one string within another is simply /string/
[08:55:35] <zoned> MeXTuX, "The returned jQuery object contains zero or one element" http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[08:56:08] <zoned> .find on the other hand returns an array
[08:56:08] <zoned> so two
[08:56:34] <zerobeholder> Let me play with that, I think I can use the container to limit which divs it acts on.
[08:56:46] <zerobeholder> I may not need the exclamation point.
[08:59:08] <zivester> anyone have a recommendation for an $.ajax timeout that would be appropriate with regards to mobile phones?  Currently I have it set to 10 seconds, but I'm thinking this might be too low?
[08:59:19] <nFFF> well even if you do, to match an exclamation at the beginning is ^\!
[09:04:31] <sunbeam> does anyone know how i can best have this script (handling a form) be able to handle ajax calls aswell as regular POSTs for this script (with JS disabled) ? http://pastebin.com/nqxDsZrt
[09:05:17] <roswell> hi everyone. is it possible to force $( selector ).accordion( 'option', 'active' ); return an active tab as a jquery object instead of its number?
[09:06:04] <zoned> roswell, what is an active tab?
[09:07:23] <roswell> zoned, an expanded accordion tab
[09:07:47] <zoned> why don't you just select it yourself afterwards?
[09:08:46] <roswell> zoned, nm it seems i've found the solution
[09:09:24] <roswell> $( '#accordion .ui-state-active' ) may return me the desired context
[09:22:03] <zivester> is this valid:  $('img')[ someboolean ? 'show' : 'hide' ](); ?
[09:23:01] <roswell> zivester, $( img ).toggle( someboolean );
[09:23:14] <shoky> but it's valid ;p
[09:24:21] <sunbeam> why if sent with an ajax call $_POST['submit'] isn't sent?
[09:24:27] <sunbeam> : $.ajax({type: 'POST', url: 'index.php?action=subscribe&ajax=true', data: $('#subscribe').serialize(), success:
[09:24:31] <sunbeam>  shouldn't it grab all form controls of #subscribe?
[09:25:03] <roswell> sunbeam, try using '#subscribe :input' as selector
[09:25:37] <sunbeam> roswell: same
[09:27:04] <PeeterWork> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10230945/jquery-ajax-loading-scripts-in-wrong-order
[09:35:41] <flecha> Hi, is there a way to make the server update the client? Instead of the client asking the server if it needs to update?
[09:36:09] <smearcampaign> longpull
[09:36:12] <smearcampaign> websockets
[09:36:20] <ngharo> carrier pidgeon
[09:36:29] <flecha> ??
[09:36:45] <smearcampaign> there are several ways
[09:36:50] <flecha> humm
[09:37:09] <smearcampaign> for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket
[09:37:40] <flecha> I am making a card game. It is easy to know thatyou need to update the board when I am the player playing the card. But I never know when another player played a card
[09:38:09] <flecha> So someone told me to use a timed funcion
[09:38:18] <flecha> (because I am using AJAX)
[09:38:23] <smearcampaign> Here is another one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)
[09:38:24] <devOlsen> why don't you setup a hidden input on the page, that gets populated with the valued of the last player?
[09:38:35] <systemfault> Beside websockets.. they're all hacks :/ And websockets are not supported everywhere..
[09:38:36] <devOlsen> that way you dont have to do work around timeouts.
[09:39:10] <flecha> devOlsen, but how would I populate it?
[09:39:34] <devOlsen> well don't you have a function that gets called or some sort of code that gets performed when the player does indeed play their turn?
[09:40:00] <devOlsen> I would at that point repopulate that value of the hidden input with that players information or id if you have one.
[09:40:06] <smearcampaign> devOlsen: I don't think you understand what he's asking
[09:40:11] <devOlsen> maybe not.
[09:40:38] <smearcampaign> when someone else on a different client does something, the server needs to push that info to all clients
[09:40:42] <devOlsen> ohhhh like a chat room sort of deal, when do I update client when another user has played.
[09:40:44] <devOlsen> gotcha.
[09:41:06] <smearcampaign> yeah, there are web sockets, which have bad support, or some hacks
[09:41:23] <ajpiano> flecha: http://socket.io
[09:41:37] <smearcampaign> I think MS said they were never going to support web sockets, but that was a long time ago
[09:41:57] <ajpiano> socket.io abstracts away all that crap and Just Works™
[09:41:57] <quicksilver> internet networking is just hacks built on hacks anyway
[09:42:03] <quicksilver> so I wouldn't let things put you off
[09:42:17] <quicksilver> long poll and stuff are quite reasonable technical solutions
[09:42:29] <systemfault> smearcampaign: MS is okay with websockets, they even made an implementation with a silverlight polyfill
[09:42:29] <quicksilver> but you need to understand your serverside and the resource implications.
[09:42:41] <systemfault> smearcampaign: It's really webgl that MS doesn't like or want to implement.
[09:42:42] <smearcampaign> really? oh, sweet.
[09:42:55] <smearcampaign> oh right! I am so wrong.
[09:43:04] <smearcampaign> Mixed those two up
[09:43:12] <flecha> What would be better than? Websockets, long pull, or timed funcion?
[09:43:33] <smearcampaign> what browsers do you need to support?
[09:43:53] <sunbeam> Is there a nice jquery function that makes it possible to nicely fade in a div?
[09:44:04] <zerobeholder> var searchterm = $('#searchinput').val();    $('.seperatediv').attr('class').match(searchterm).show();
[09:44:07] <systemfault> sunbeam: .fadeIn(500);
[09:44:18] <zerobeholder> what am I doing wrong?
[09:44:22] <Cork[home]> sunbeam: div.hide().fadeIn('slow')
[09:44:38] <flecha> smearcampaign, FF at least
[09:44:51] <flecha> chrme would me good too
[09:44:53] <Tsddfa> anyone know why submitting a form using jquery-ui autocomplete() clears the form even though submit() should return false?
[09:44:56] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: that code doesn't make sence
[09:45:05] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: what are you trying to do?
[09:45:15] <smearcampaign> flecha: I would go with web sockets but maybe do some research
[09:45:16] <zerobeholder> get the div with the class .separated div.
[09:45:34] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: thats plain $('.seperatediv')
[09:45:43] <Cork[home]> * $('.seperate div')
[09:45:43] <flecha> What if I want this thing to run in cel phones
[09:45:49] <zerobeholder> then check that div's class attribute for the search term
[09:46:01] <ThiefMaster> why are you abusing the class attribute like this?
[09:46:05] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: and?
[09:46:08] <ThiefMaster> use data attributes for things like this
[09:46:09] <zerobeholder> because I'm a newb
[09:46:28] <zerobeholder> probably should be using a data tag
[09:46:33] <zerobeholder> data attribute
[09:46:34] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder:  var searchterm = $('#searchinput').val();    $('.seperate div.' + searchterm).show();
[09:46:44] <smearcampaign> felcha: I dunno, really. google around for support for the different ways.
[09:47:02] <zerobeholder> will it match the substring in part or whole?
[09:47:22] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: it will match divs that has the class
[09:47:29] <sunbeam> systemfault: (first write it at the end of a <form>?
[09:47:37] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: if thats not what you want, you shouldn't be using class
[09:48:43] <dethkrieg> Is it possible to bind an event handler for an object to perform an action both on "change" and also when the object is loaded?
[09:48:52] <Cork[home]> man mozilla update server are SLOW today >_<
[09:48:57] <zerobeholder> eventually as I type it should reduce the results based on fewer and fewer substring matches. I suppose I can put the concatenated and specialcharacter removed names anywhere. I just happened to put them in class for lack of a better idea.
[09:48:57] <ThiefMaster> .on('load change', function() {})
[09:49:15] <Cork[home]> opps wrong channel
[09:49:19] <dethkrieg> will try, ThiefMaster
[09:49:49] <sunbeam> how can i first write a new div with a class and then fill its contents with a code like $('html').find('.form_result').html(response); ??
[09:49:52] <flecha> ok, thanks for the tips, guys. I will study them
[09:49:52] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: it looks like you should store that somewhere other then in the dom
[09:50:15] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: cause you would be doing a lot of selection and thats quite costly if you need to traverse the dom each time
[09:50:29] <zerobeholder> where should inexperience over here be looking to store that information?
[09:50:51] <zerobeholder> data attribute?
[09:51:05] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: i would store it as pure js variables
[09:51:11] <sunbeam> Cork[home]: do you maybe know this?
[09:51:13] <Cork[home]> with a reference to the html
[09:51:57] <zerobeholder> but I want it to modify the dom css stuff based on that. via hide and show...
[09:52:17] <Cork[home]> sunbeam:  $('<div/>').addClass('some-class').append(html).appendTo('target')
[09:52:24] <Joeytje50> hey, I was using AJAX and I got an error in what seemed to be a correct AJAX request, but it gives http://pastebin.com/AktDRKU0 as error
[09:52:26] <zerobeholder> it is a list of facebook users that I am iterating over.
[09:52:44] <Joeytje50> I am using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js as JQuery import
[09:52:46] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: yes, but thats where the reference comes in
[09:52:48] <sunbeam> Cork[home]: why </div> ?
[09:53:01] <Cork[home]> sunbeam: <div/> not </div> :)
[09:53:06] <Cork[home]> sunbeam: its the new object
[09:53:10] <Cork[home]> uh, *element
[09:53:18] <sunbeam> Cork[home]: oops sorry
[09:53:22] <Joeytje50> does anyone know if this is a common thing? and what is the cause?
[09:53:33] <zerobeholder> Initially all 'people silly enough to friend me' are shown
[09:54:09] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: what your getting from the server?
[09:54:39] <Joeytje50> I get the error before I can even get any data back from the server
[09:54:40] <zerobeholder> PHP dumps everything into the dom via and appendChild loop with the two classes one static to find them, and one variable based on the fb user name.
[09:54:48] <Joeytje50> I get that within a millisecond after the request
[09:55:09] <zerobeholder> *an -- not and appendChild loop
[09:55:13] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: var filters = [{ filter: 'some thing to filter on', id: '#mike54'}, ...];
[09:55:22] <Cork[home]> something like that is what i would do
[09:55:50] <Cork[home]> then you would just loop over the array each time you want to regulate the filters
[09:56:24] <Joeytje50> Cork[home]: the error is on the line with return (match === "*" && elem.nodeType === 1) || elem.nodeName.toLowerCase() === match;
[09:56:25] <Cork[home]> zerobeholder: what happens on line 63 in your page?
[09:56:30] <Cork[home]> opps wrong nick
[09:56:42] <zerobeholder> This so at the edge of my capabilities...
[09:56:44] <Joeytje50> probably because elem.nodeName is undefined or something
[09:57:03] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: in what file?
[09:57:06] <zerobeholder> *current capabilities
[09:57:19] <Joeytje50> in http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js Cork[home]
[09:57:31] <Joeytje50> that's where the error occurs
[09:57:38] <Joeytje50> http://pastebin.com/AktDRKU0
[09:58:04] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: the data has been returned from the server
[09:58:16] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: jquery is trying to select in it it looks like
[09:58:53] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: but i need the code from submitOfferindex.php:63
[09:59:07] <Cork[home]> cause thats prob where it comes from
[09:59:14] <aksnowman> does IE + latest jquery not support $('input').on({ change: function(){} }); ? it doesn't seem to be working for me in ie8 or ie9
[10:00:35] <Joeytje50> Cork[home]: that would be the function submitOffer() in index.php, which is http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.js/shops.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript
[10:01:01] <Joeytje50> and that script also uses the callAPI function on http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript
[10:01:57] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: var amount = parseInt($(this).attr('data-amount')); won't work
[10:02:09] <Joeytje50> why?
[10:02:22] <Cork[home]> cause your passing this as thisid
[10:02:30] <Cork[home]> this isn't defined, its just a function
[10:02:43] <Cork[home]> *thistd
[10:03:53] <Joeytje50> no Cork[home], I want to get the data-amount attribute's value from the $('.buy b, .sell b') that is clicked on
[10:04:05] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: then you need to pass that to the function
[10:04:24] <Cork[home]> this isn't inherited by just calling a function
[10:04:40] <Cork[home]> you can set it with .call if you like
[10:04:49] <shoky> aksnowman it works fine
[10:04:49] <Joeytje50> okay, so I'd need var thisb = $(this); above the function, then call the function with submitOffer(itemtd,thisb);
[10:04:50] <Cork[home]> ?mdc call
[10:04:52] <bot-t> Cork[home], call - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[10:05:03] <Joeytje50> and then use parseInt($(thisb).attr('data-amount')); ?
[10:05:15] <Cork[home]> thats an alternative yes
[10:05:26] <Cork[home]> but it needs to be passed one way or another
[10:05:39] <Joeytje50> okay
[10:06:42] <Cork[home]> Joeytje50: i would put a breakpoint where it crashes and backstep out of it until you get to where the falty variable comes from
[10:07:14] <Cork[home]> (if that fix i gave you didn't fix it)
[10:07:27] <Joeytje50> I changed the $(this) to $(thisb), and it does work now
[10:07:30] <Joeytje50> thanks for the help
[10:07:34] <Cork[home]> heh
[10:07:35] <Cork[home]> np
[10:08:37] <zoned> if i have 3 radio buttons.... when i select one, its "change" event is fired. but when i select another one, is there any event or some way i can know which one just got deselected then?
[10:09:14] <Cork[home]> zoned: no
[10:09:38] <Cork[home]> you would have to store a cache and update on change
[10:10:13] <devOlsen> or condition agains them with unique ids and a single bound click event to all three, while tapping into e.target.. but to each his own.
[10:11:11] <zoned> basically my problem is that i have a bunch of groups of radio buttons, and at all times i need to maintain an up to date array of which ones are selected. but i don't want to iterate over ALL of them every time a change event is fired. what's the most efficient way?
[10:12:40] <Cork[home]> zoned: well if you store the values by the input options name
[10:12:46] <Cork[home]> you could just replace it
[10:12:54] <akahn> can I only cancel a form from being submitted via enter key with the keypress event, not with keyup?
[10:13:10] <Cork[home]> akahn: keypress or keydown yes
[10:13:14] <Cork[home]> keyup is too late
[10:14:05] <catcher> wouldn't change be better so you're not firing events when they haven't changed?
[10:14:34] <Cork[home]> change fires when you move away from a text field you've changed
[10:14:49] <catcher> ah right, with lost focus
[10:15:15] <akahn> Cork[home]: thank you. do you have any advice for how to handle this? http://pastie.org/3817866 my disabling/enabling code needs to use keyup, but the enter stuff needs keypress or keydown
[10:16:11] <Cork[home]> ah
[10:16:24] <Cork[home]> akahn: do you need the form?
[10:16:46] <Cork[home]> that is is this ajax or not?
[10:16:46] <akahn> Cork[home]: it's where I put method and action, so kinda, but go on
[10:16:50] <akahn> it's ajax
[10:17:07] <Cork[home]> then you could just have the url else where and skip the form
[10:17:20] <akahn> what would that do for me?
[10:17:23] <Cork[home]> then there is nothing to trigger on enter
[10:17:33] <akahn> hm, what do you mean?
[10:17:55] <Cork[home]> <form></form> is what makes submit on enter happen
[10:18:10] <Cork[home]> if you tirgger the ajax submit when you want it from your code instead
[10:18:13] <akahn> okay, so you're saying I could add the enter on submit behavior myself, rather than trying to negate the browser's behavior
[10:18:22] <Cork[home]> exactly
[10:18:44] <Cork[home]> that only works if your soly ajax thought
[10:20:19] <Cork[home]> akahn: another option would be to prevent always prevent enter submit
[10:20:30] <Cork[home]> akahn: and instead trigger form.submit() when you want it
[10:20:38] <Cork[home]> that might be a nicer solution
[10:20:45] <akahn> Cork[home]: i think i'm gonna go with http://pastie.org/3817866
[10:21:47] <Cork[home]> that should work
[10:22:21] <aftab> Hello, is it possible to target the script element which loaded the function to find it
[10:24:47] <Cork[home]> aftab: after the script tag has been parsed, it has no meaning to js anymore
[10:25:28] <Cork[home]> you can remove the tag for all js cares :)
[10:25:32] <aftab> Cork[home]: How do I create a div tag just next to the script element which has loaded the javascript please ?
[10:25:43] <Cork[home]> you can't
[10:25:55] <Cork[home]> you can hack it with the old dom1 document.write
[10:25:58] <Cork[home]> but thats it
[10:26:14] <Cork[home]> use a class or id to reference the location instead
[10:26:29] <aftab> Cork[home]: Actually the script element doesn't have any reference
[10:26:35] <aftab> that is the main problem
[10:27:03] <Cork[home]> i meant an element located where you want an output
[10:27:27] <Cork[home]> aftab: you should thing of js and html as two separate entities
[10:27:31] <Cork[home]> *think
[10:27:51] <Cork[home]> and js can only access html if html provides ways to find where to put it
[10:28:35] <aftab> Cork[home]: Ok I understand, but in my case there is no id and class for that script element, I tried $(this) but it doesn't work
[10:28:53] <Cork[home]> aftab: your missing the point a bit
[10:28:56] <aftab> Cork[home]: I see there is no way to add element without proper referencing
[10:29:01] <Cork[home]> aftab: add an element where you want the output
[10:29:17] <Cork[home]> ignore the existence of the script tag
[10:29:46] <m3t4> Hello, i have a problem with a toggle() function, after page refresh first time user has to double click the button, other clicks work fine need only one time click http://jsfiddle.net/NgDnj/
[10:30:21] <aftab> Cork[home]: That is the problem the code has been placed by users on their websites with just the script tag without id so I am now working on it to load the content of that script tag using ajax but displaying the content loaded by javascript document.write isn't working until I have a target element on the web page
[10:30:44] <devOlsen> m3t4? intresting way to close off your anchor tag /></a>
[10:30:52] <Cork[home]> aftab: then you can't really do it
[10:31:15] <Cork[home]> js has no consept of "where the script tag was"
[10:31:16] <devOlsen> ahh nm haha just woke up, sorry I see the image now.
[10:31:32] <aftab> Cork[home]: Ok then is there any other way please let me explain what I am doing here please
[10:32:02] <aftab> Cork[home]: This tag is placed on website1.com <srcript src="http://www.website2.com/widget.js"></script>
[10:32:05] <Cork[home]> aftab: you need the user to provide you with a canvas
[10:32:51] <Cork[home]> simplest would be to ex not do anything from the loading of the script, just define a function
[10:33:02] <Cork[home]> and then let the user run the script with the element it want it in
[10:33:16] <m3t4> devOlsen yes, it is image tag
[10:33:22] <aftab> Cork[home]: website2.com/widget.js uses jquery to load website2.com/widget2.js content which has this output document.write("alert('hey');");
[10:33:27] <Cork[home]> aftab: and as we'r in jquery you can attach it to $.fn.mywidget
[10:33:36] <aftab> yes
[10:33:42] <devOlsen> ahem and also using php that makes this example un-usable m3t4.
[10:33:55] <aftab> the alert works here
[10:34:11] <aftab> but when i output some html tags with it it doesnt' work
[10:34:16] <Cork[home]> aftab: you shouldn't document.write js
[10:34:31] <Cork[home]> i can't even think of how that can actually work
[10:34:37] <aftab> ah got it
[10:34:48] <aftab> i was actually displaying it as javascript
[10:34:55] <aftab> i should display it as plain text
[10:35:05] <Cork[home]> aftab: to be honest you should NEVER use document.write
[10:35:19] <devOlsen> I agree with Cork[home] 100% there.
[10:35:48] <m3t4> any ideas how fix this bug?
[10:35:50] <Cork[home]> document.write is a function that exist cause of legacy
[10:35:54] <aftab> Cork[home]: I will not use it now as its solved I don't have to use it anymore
[10:35:58] <aftab> Cork[home]: thank you
[10:35:59] <Cork[home]> its dead old and a louse idea
[10:36:06] <Cork[home]> np
[10:36:11] <nathanstaines> are you able to animate the width of an element that is being changed by toggleClass?
[10:36:12] <devOlsen> m3t4 no cause your example is not going to show us the "bug" persay in jsfiddle.
[10:36:15] <devOlsen> you have  PHP in there man
[10:36:25] <devOlsen> that echos out ids that this JS function you wrote uses.
[10:36:31] <Cork[home]> nathanstaines: you need jquery-ui core for that
[10:36:49] <m3t4> aa..
[10:36:58] <Cork[home]> ?g jquery ui addClass animate
[10:37:00] <bot-t> Cork[home], jQuery UI - AddClass Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/addClass/
[10:37:01] <aftab> Cork[home]: one more question though, if i can't use document.write how can I display html tags on that page thn ?
[10:37:34] <Cork[home]> aftab: if your using jquery .html/append/prepend/...
[10:37:45] <Cork[home]> if native appendChild or innerHTML
[10:37:49] <nathanstaines> thanks Cork[home] i'll take a look at that
[10:37:58] <devOlsen> &lt;html&gt; ?
[10:37:59] <aftab> great thx
[10:38:02] <devOlsen> hehe
[10:38:14] <Jon47> here's a good synopsis of why document.write is bad: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/04/10/dont-docwrite-scripts/ (and I'll add, it also results in really hard to maintain code)
[10:38:56] <Jon47> i guess that's just for a specific use-case, but still
[10:38:58] <Jon47> worth a read
[10:41:10] <devOlsen> "I have a great site with great markup in my documents body, now lets use document.write... OH GOD all my markup is gone cause document.write has just wrote away all my document's body markup with non-parse able text..." face palm.
[10:49:59] <Mkop> anyone know of a company selling IE punching bags or dartboards?
[10:50:01] <Morbus> evening. js/jquery newb. jsfiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/P9twu/
[10:50:09] <Morbus> i'm trying to make the JS more elegant. it feels ooky.
[10:50:19] <Morbus> i don't like the three sets of dupe code
[10:50:54] <Mkop> Morbus: option 1: use jquery-ui tabs
[10:51:02] <Morbus> i don't want to load that entire thing in.
[10:51:11] <Mkop> option 2: I'll throw together a fiddle now to illustrate
[10:51:13] <Morbus> i don't need 6 million lines of CSS and UI stuff for this.
[10:51:18] <Morbus> Mkop: ok, cool, thanks.
[10:51:42] <Morbus> i HAVE done this in jquery UI before, when I did need other UI elements.
[10:51:50] <Morbus> but these buttons are the only thing that will ever exist.
[10:51:56] <Morbus> there's not even notions of tab groups or anything.
[10:52:45] <quicksilver> Morbus: toggleSection could be written as $('.section').not('#'+section).hide(); $('#'+section).show();
[10:52:51] <quicksilver> Morbus: bit shorter.
[10:53:21] <Morbus> i'll roll with that, sure, but doesn't repair the repeated button toggles.
[10:53:28] <quicksilver> no, I think Mkop is working on that ;P
[10:53:32] <Morbus> :)
[10:53:37] <quicksilver> you can regexp 'button-' into 'section-'
[10:53:49] <Morbus> quicksilver: i was thinking of something like that, but i don't know how to do it myself.
[10:54:49] <Mkop> not quite working yet but here's the gist: http://jsfiddle.net/P9twu/1/
[10:55:39] <Morbus> mmM.
[10:55:42] <Morbus> i see what you're doing.
[10:56:16] <Mkop> oh, here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/P9twu/2/
[10:57:10] <Mkop> not sure whether I'd prefer this over regexing
[10:57:33] <Morbus> yeah, at the moment, i'm trying the regex thing'
[10:57:36] <quicksilver> Morbus: I'd do it like this : http://jsfiddle.net/MXQWZ/
[10:57:36] <Cork[home]> quicksilver: or you could just do  $('.section').hide(); $('#'+section).show();
[10:57:38] <Morbus> with
[10:57:38] <Morbus>   function toggleSection(section) {
[10:57:38] <Morbus>     section.replace('button-', 'section');
[10:57:44] <quicksilver> Cork[home]: indeed.
[10:57:47] <Mkop> the data-section="#bla" method is more powerful in that it allows you to have arbitrary associations between buttons and sections, but that also introduces the chance for bugs
[10:57:47] <Cork[home]> quicksilver: that will give the same result :)
[10:57:47] <Morbus> but, i dunno how to take the .button and pass in the ID.
[10:57:57] <Cork[home]> with even less code and work
[10:58:39] <quicksilver> Morbus: http://jsfiddle.net/MXQWZ/1/
[10:58:53] <Morbus> quicksilver: that's what i just saved and am about to test :D
[10:59:06] <Morbus> yeah, that works great. thanks.
[10:59:08] <Morbus> and i understand it! ;)
[10:59:37] <Morbus> thanks guys.
[11:00:24] <ezio> how do i make the date picker appear in another div?
[11:00:46] <ezio> instead of the same div as the click target
[11:02:15] <Cork[home]> ezio: check container
[11:03:05] <Cork[home]> bah...
[11:03:12] <Cork[home]> its not exposed on datepicker >_>
[11:04:51] <ezio> yeah ... kinda weird ... why would anyone want it in the same div as the click
[11:06:01] <aksnowman> http://jsfiddle.net/DWSUQ/ <-- in ff both the keyup and the change are working, but in IE 8 and IE 9, only the keyup seems to be running, can anyone confirm and possibly help me figure out wtf I'm doing wrong? haha
[11:08:51] <Cork[home]> ezio: its normally meant to be located related to an input field
[11:09:04] <Cork[home]> ezio: and then it just hooks to the closest parent
[11:09:16] <ezio> yeah but then it would push everything down
[11:09:19] <Cork[home]> ezio: is overflow hitting you?
[11:09:20] <ezio> i couldn't make ti float
[11:09:31] <Cork[home]> thats not expected
[11:09:42] <Cork[home]> you sure you've loaded the jqeury ui css?
[11:09:50] <ezio> and <div>Pick a date<div class="date_picker ... is not valid html
[11:09:50] <Cork[home]> *jquery
[11:09:54] <misutowolf> Hm.   What's a quick way to make sure that jQuery is getting properly incorporated into my page correctly?  And...since Javascript is client side...do I need to be hosting shit on a local apache server to have work, or not?   my local pages aren't working correctly
[11:09:56] <misutowolf> >=/
[11:10:31] <ezio> Cork[home], yup
[11:10:32] <Cork[home]> misutowolf: jquery works just fine from file://
[11:10:53] <Cork[home]> misutowolf: thought yes, if your developing a webpage you should set up a development server
[11:11:07] <warrenparsons> misutowolf: It's generally good practice to attempt loading jQuery from a common CDN (such as Google) with a local fallback. Example code - http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/ad6cD/
[11:11:17] <Cork[home]> or you risk getting hit with loads of annoying stuffs
[11:11:43] <Cork[home]> ezio: could you provide a link?
[11:11:56] <ezio> i'll jsfiddle it
[11:12:03] <aniasis> Hey I am performing a removeClass on an element.  When I look at the element through firebug the classes are gone but when I check the DOM they are still there
[11:12:21] <NoiseEee> aniasis: "check the DOM"?
[11:12:23] <Cork[home]> aniasis: check the dom?
[11:12:34] <Cork[home]> aniasis: you mean check the source code?
[11:12:37] <aniasis> the dom tree
[11:12:41] <aniasis> no
[11:12:59] <Cork[home]> the tree in firebug?
[11:13:02] <jmonreal> Hi guys, I have a question about jqueryui autocomplete
[11:13:06] <aniasis> yes
[11:13:13] <jmonreal> if I have a word with accent, like Hóla
[11:13:18] <jmonreal> and i write ho
[11:13:23] <jmonreal> it doesnt show
[11:13:26] <jmonreal> why would that be?
[11:13:33] <Cork[home]> aniasis: how are you selecting the element?
[11:13:38] <aniasis> but I just do jQuery('#element').attr('class');
[11:13:40] <Cork[home]> is it id based?
[11:13:46] <warrenparsons> jmonreal: Because they're different characters.
[11:13:47] <ezio> Cork[home], http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:13:53] <ezio> and it shows up on start, too
[11:13:59] <jmonreal> warrenparsons: but how the examples in the web work?
[11:14:03] <aniasis> and the classes I removed are still there.
[11:14:09] <misutowolf> Hm.
[11:14:09] <ezio> and my font em and line-size is messing things up
[11:14:14] <ezio> so i want it in a different div
[11:14:15] <Cork[home]> aniasis: check $('[id="element"]').length
[11:14:23] <Cork[home]> it should be 1
[11:14:24] <warrenparsons> jmonreal: Which example?
[11:14:26] <Whirl3d> Are there other GUI frameworks that are less involved than jquery UI?
[11:14:26] <aniasis> it is there
[11:14:32] <Cork[home]> aniasis:  if its > then you have problem
[11:14:33] <aniasis> it is one
[11:14:55] <misutowolf> People keep telling me that this click event (when I put the code up on JSFiddle) works, but locally...it doesn't.   This is dumb.
[11:15:04] <jmonreal> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/folding.html
[11:15:04] <Cork[home]> aniasis: you forgot to save ;)
[11:15:09] <aniasis> ??
[11:15:14] <Cork[home]> opps wrong nick
[11:15:15] <jmonreal> warrenparsons: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/folding.html
[11:15:17] <jmonreal> that one
[11:15:23] <Cork[home]> ezio: you forgot to save
[11:15:36] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/YsPQu/
[11:15:47] <warrenparsons> jmonreal: Are you including the accentMap functionality in your own code?
[11:15:49] <ezio> did i seriously just paste the root to js fiddle?
[11:16:01] <jmonreal> warrenparsons: I believe the accent folding is for when entering a word with accent, isnt?
[11:16:01] <ezio> holy crap that's dumb
[11:16:35] <aksnowman> http://jsfiddle.net/DWSUQ/ <-- in ff both the keyup and the change are working, but in IE 8 and IE 9, only the keyup seems to be running, can anyone confirm and possibly help me figure out wtf I'm doing wrong? haha
[11:17:05] <jmonreal> warrenparsons: yes I am
[11:17:11] <aniasis> Cork[home]: I'm jQuery('.class').each(function() { jQuery(this).removeClass('random') });  But I come back and do a jQuery('#id').attr('class') and random is still there.
[11:17:16] <Cork[home]> ezio: datepicker is meant to take an input field, not a div
[11:17:31] <Cork[home]> ezio: its added as ui-datepicker-inline
[11:17:34] <ezio> that's not what the docs say
[11:17:40] <ezio> yeah
[11:17:44] <aniasis> or even a jQuery('#id').hasClass('random') and it is true
[11:17:55] <jmonreal> could it be the encoding?
[11:17:56] <ezio> it says if you attach it to a div it will -inline style
[11:18:10] <warrenparsons> jmonreal: Possibly. Are you using UTF-8?
[11:18:26] <Cork[home]> aniasis: what your describing is the symtoms of multible id's in the page
[11:18:40] <Cork[home]> there can't really be anything other then that
[11:19:26] <misutowolf> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
[11:19:50] <aniasis> Cork[home]: not related the actual elements I am evaluating?
[11:19:53] <Cork[home]> ezio: ya, so the div you give it should be the div you want it in
[11:20:12] <ezio> Cork[home], yes but then how do you attach the click event?
[11:20:31] <Cork[home]> aniasis: id's are uniq it can only exist once in a page, if it exists more then one time, only one of them can be selected by id
[11:20:41] <aniasis> No
[11:20:44] <aniasis> I know this.
[11:20:44] <Cork[home]> yes
[11:21:14] <Cork[home]> ezio: click event for what?
[11:21:28] <aniasis> I mean if there are other elements than the ones I am evaluating with the same IDs will it affect me code
[11:22:02] <warrenparsons> aniasis: That can have unpredictable side effects, and different browsers can treat it differently since it's not valid code.
[11:22:03] <ezio> Cork[home], for the calendar to show ... http://jsfiddle.net/YsPQu/1/  ... here's what i was trying to do before i realized i couldn't select the taarget div for the datepicker
[11:22:24] <Cork[home]> ezio: its inline, its always shown
[11:22:27] <ezio> Cork[home], another thing is ... the datepicker is supposed to start display none
[11:22:36] <Cork[home]> not when its inline
[11:22:52] <ezio> Cork[home], it's still inline
[11:23:12] <Cork[home]> yes, what i mean is; when its inline it starts shown
[11:23:37] <ezio> well that's a problem ... how does it blur?
[11:24:03] <Cork[home]> $('#start_date').hide()
[11:24:12] <ezio> how do i detect a lbur
[11:24:14] <ezio> blur
[11:25:49] <ezio> i find it strange that even if you're using the input box, that you just have to simply accept the fact that it will push everything down once it shows
[11:26:10] <Cork[home]> not if its hovering
[11:26:14] <Jon30> Is there such thing as a hidden attribute for an anchor tag, one that I can retrieve using jquery? right now I am doing the trick with the title attribute, but the problem with title is that it pops up when you hold the mouse over the object. any ideas?
[11:26:32] <aniasis> warrenparsons: I removed all duplicate IDs.  Still doesn't remove the classes
[11:26:38] <warrenparsons> Jon30: The HTML5 data attribute is your friend.
[11:26:44] <Cork[home]> ezio: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#animation
[11:26:50] <warrenparsons> ?data @ Jon30
[11:26:51] <bot-t> Jon30, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:27:06] <aniasis> warrenparsons: they were IDs not related to the elements I was evaluating also
[11:27:15] <aksnowman> so nobody has any ideas to help me with my .on() `change` IE issues? :(
[11:27:21] <Jon30> warrenparsons: what would happen if i load it into a html4 browser?
[11:27:36] <Cork[home]> Jon30: its backwards compatible
[11:28:06] <ezio> Cork[home], is there a hover option?
[11:28:07] <Cork[home]> Jon30: and data-<what ever> attributes is reserved so its safe to use
[11:28:15] <Jon30> Thank you warrenparsons and Cork[home]
[11:28:26] <warrenparsons> aniasis: Debugging is a multi-step process. Removing duplicate IDs helps rule out certain causes.
[11:28:28] <Cork[home]> ezio: bind mouseenter and mouseout on the div
[11:28:49] <ezio> Cork[home], okay
[11:29:09] <Cork[home]> ezio: but ya, theres some events for the widget if its the none inline version
[11:29:26] <warrenparsons> aksnowman: Your syntax for .on() is wrong.
[11:29:59] <andygraybeal> is there a php hook i need to install to get jquery working?
[11:30:07] <devOlsen> anyone got a good lib for custom styled scroll bars that and be introduced or removed on elements via some kind of edge detection for when screen height is smaller than allowed real-estate?
[11:30:17] <devOlsen> can be*
[11:30:24] <NoiseEee> andygraybeal: hmmmmm?
[11:30:41] <andygraybeal> NoiseEee, yyes, that is the answer i expected. i'm totally confused and this has nothign to do with PHP correct?
[11:30:59] <andygraybeal> i don't need to install something like php5-jquery
[11:31:06] <aksnowman> warrenparsons: really? that's how it shows in the 2nd to last example on the docs, and I've used taht same syntax for plenty of other sets of events (though I guess I've never confirmed those in IE)
[11:31:07] <NoiseEee> AndrewX192: no, im not sure what that would be
[11:31:10] <aniasis> warrenparsons: I found it.  I was binding and event to that class on page load, and I had a live bind on an adjacent class.
[11:31:14] <aksnowman> or did I typo something somewhere?
[11:31:15] <NoiseEee> andygraybeal: : no, im not sure what that would be
[11:31:17] <aksnowman> :(
[11:31:24] <andygraybeal> NoiseEee, okay awesome thank you.
[11:31:47] <andygraybeal> i'm having an issue with a gallery that uses jquery and i don't know where the problem stems, i'm sure it's not your problem.  i'll stop bothering you guys.  thank you.
[11:32:37] <arcanin> hi
[11:32:53] <arcanin> is there a way to trigger a callback before and after a keypress event ?
[11:33:02] <arcanin> I would like to get the old value and the new one
[11:33:12] <arcanin> (of an input field)
[11:34:06] <aksnowman> lmao, he told me my syntax was wrong, and disappeared XD
[11:34:08] <Cork[home]> arcanin: keydown and keyup
[11:34:27] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: was it you with the on problem?
[11:34:57] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: yes
[11:35:05] <Cork[home]> can you send the link again
[11:35:08] <aksnowman> change isn't working on IE
[11:35:13] <Cork[home]> never had time to look at it before
[11:35:15] <aksnowman> http://jsfiddle.net/DWSUQ/
[11:35:44] <aksnowman> basically, the latter inputs should only allow numeric + period (which is the keyup)
[11:36:00] <aksnowman> and on change, it does some more numeric checks and calls a function for me
[11:36:12] <aksnowman> but the change event is never being triggered in IE 8 or 9 for me
[11:37:56] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: i don't have access to a windows maching right now, but let me look around a bit
[11:38:02] <panzi> I haven't used jQuery UI DnD before and I wonder if this would be possible with it: I have a source list of items and a (initialy empty) target list. I drag items from source to target, but they also stay in the source list (copy). you can resort the items in the target list (also by droping someting from source that is already in there at another place)
[11:38:03] <Cork[home]> *machine
[11:38:30] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: thanks, appriciate it :)
[11:38:36] <panzi> and can I somehow generate drag start/drag move/drop events?
[11:38:41] <jholloman> has anyone built jquery-ui recently? I'm trying to do it with grunt (first time using grunt) with no success
[11:38:45] <zerobeholder> I am spectacular at failing! http://pastebin.com/Cu1NWWGD
[11:38:56] <panzi> because I want to use certain user definded gestures for that on iOS
[11:39:14] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: the syntax is correct at least, i can give you that much :)
[11:39:23] <ezio> Cork[home], thanks buds
[11:39:48] <Cork[home]> ezio: np
[11:39:51] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: thought so, haha, he had me double-checking everything when he said that
[11:40:21] <Cork[home]> i need to check if ie9 supports for(in)
[11:40:26] <Cork[home]> i think it does, but not sure
[11:40:56] <zerobeholder> Still cannot get divs that contain a substring (found as user input of a text box) to .show()
[11:44:54] <misutowolf> So, I get this feeling that jQuery isn't loading properly when I run this script outside JSFiddle.
[11:44:55] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/GC2mp/
[11:45:12] <misutowolf> On my local box, I get no window when I click the images that are supposed to be used for the event in question
[11:45:13] <misutowolf> AND
[11:45:52] <misutowolf> Apparently I'm still having problems when it comes to grabbing the right div traversing around.
[11:46:02] <misutowolf> Anyone have any insight why it wouldn't work locally?
[11:46:41] <Parhs> hello guys
[11:46:41] <shoky> what is your feeling based on
[11:46:51] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: ok, this is what i think happens
[11:47:10] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: i suspect that input change events doesn't bubble in ie
[11:47:36] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: the event listner is bound so jquery has done its job
[11:47:48] <Cork[home]> its just not getting any child events
[11:48:14] <Parhs> i wont to have an attribute like   data-offered="3 5 12 54"  and then select with jquery those that dont have the number i want.. how can i do that?
[11:48:44] <shoky> misutowolf where are you linking to jquery..
[11:49:02] <zerobeholder> so, I figured out .attr() was only giving me the first element and crapping out -- as documented
[11:49:26] <shoky> you can read hurrah
[11:49:33] <misutowolf> In the version on my webpage (I removed it from the Fiddle, since it does it automatically), I have this:
[11:49:49] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: so I'd have to do a seperate: $('.itemRow input').on({ click: so the listener is on the inputs themselves? and just add the listener to each item I add dynamically to the page?
[11:49:51] <shoky> why would you remove that? to confuse us? wtf
[11:50:08] <misutowolf> I'll just put it back.   It's not like I intentionally did it to confuse people.
[11:50:10] <zerobeholder> following a suggestion I $(.separatediv).each() so that I could work with the elements one at a time
[11:50:12] <misutowolf> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <--   What I'm using
[11:50:16] <tw2113> $('#shoky').confuse('fast'); shoky
[11:50:27] <shoky> i mean, either paste the whole html , or dont
[11:50:36] <shoky> but dont paste the whole thing and then remove the one thing that has to do with your question
[11:51:09] <shoky> misutowolf, and what is your feeling based on
[11:51:09] <misutowolf> I'll throw it back.  That's the connection to jQuery though.
[11:51:29] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: donno yet, still checking
[11:51:52] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: k, thanks :)
[11:52:24] <shoky> hi tw2113
[11:52:33] <zerobeholder> inside of the each I am putting a function that has a single if to check whether $(this).attr().match(regexpr) is true or not. If it is true, $(this).show().
[11:53:33] <kalleth> anyone know why, on jquery 1.7.2, $("#element").fadeIn(); isn't working?
[11:53:43] <shoky> ?demo @ kalleth
[11:53:43] <bot-t> kalleth, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:53:45] <kalleth> well, it works, the element shows itself after the requisite amount of time, but it doesn't actually fade
[11:53:53] <zerobeholder> --hmm better make sure the regexp I defined is in the function's scope. It should...
[11:54:03] <kalleth> I can PM a demo link, but the site isn't supposed to be live, shoky, so I can't say it publically, that OK?
[11:54:15] <shoky> make a new simple fiddle demonstrating your problem
[11:54:27] <shoky> oh, PM
[11:54:30] <shoky> no prob..
[11:54:42] <shoky> but fiddle is better :P
[11:54:55] <drummer306> hi, more css issue, looking for the dialog popup UI but without the popup.  Is there a setting for that, or just grab the classes ?
[11:54:56] <shoky> because you'll prolly figure out by the time you finish making it
[11:55:19] <kalleth> yeah, shoky, i'll look at fiddle right now while you check out that link I sent :)
[11:55:55] <z1000> I added a simple anchor link in jquery fancybox..I cannot seem to attach any jQuery to it... seems like fancybox wont allow me to do that, any ideas? Click a photo then hit book room..
[11:56:07] <z1000> http://ogk123.com/private-dining/
[11:56:42] <jstout24> i i have a jquery plugin that is like, $('a.item').dialogable()…. within it, it basically binds $(this).bind(this.action….. { … })
[11:56:49] <jstout24> how can i make this work for all future a.item elements?
[11:56:55] <jstout24> live works but it's depreciated?
[11:56:58] <jstout24> on isn't working
[11:58:13] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: ok, its the delegate selector breaking things; need to check in jquery.js to find what that might be
[11:58:34] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: this looks like a bug or similar in jquery actually
[11:59:09] <gho5t> what's the jquery function to break the current chain and go back to the first item selected
[11:59:31] <gho5t> end
[12:00:55] <jstout24> this works though: https://gist.github.com/e875adc6ffec281bb9dd
[12:01:01] <jstout24> which route should i take it
[12:07:22] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/GC2mp/2/
[12:07:42] <misutowolf> That's with the jQuery load (google cdn) thrown in there, etc.  Still not working as intended.
[12:07:45] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: so for now, I'll probably just have it ccall my function on keyup, and comment out the rest, and will see if you come up w/ anything else or will wait for the next version of jquery? lol
[12:07:57] <misutowolf> When I load this locally or anywhere outside JSFiddle, the ready event doesn't fire, so it never handles clicks
[12:08:02] <misutowolf> >=/
[12:08:36] <misutowolf> And even when it loads in JSFiddle, it still doesn't toggle the DIV i want it to toggle.
[12:11:00] <misutowolf> :(
[12:11:46] <VernonK> Anyone have intimate knowledge of Widget Factory?  We're having an issue with a widget built as a widget factory widget that has another instantiation of the same type of widget within.  Clicks at times are taking two actual clicks to fire the event.  Any ideas?
[12:12:17] <nVee> evening, I have a input within a form inside of a table. I am trying to get the value of the 1st td in that specific table row (one the input is in). I have tried $("selector").parent("tr").find("td:eq(0)").html() but it returns blank
[12:12:20] <VernonK> I'm wondering if the second instantiation of the same type of widget within another widget may be getting jQuery UI confused.
[12:12:34] <nVee> if I change parent to parents it however works but it does not return the correct content
[12:13:24] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: ok, this is weird http://jsfiddle.net/DWSUQ/2 works...
[12:15:19] <misutowolf> Ugh.   I don't know what the hell I should be using to find these divs that need toggled.
[12:15:19] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: its $(this).val( $(this).val().replace( /[^0-9\.]/g, '') ); that breaks ie
[12:16:09] <aksnowman> Cork[home]: ahh! ok
[12:16:48] <aksnowman> wow, that's weird, 'cause the keyup part is actually executing properly, haha
[12:17:00] <aksnowman> so it's just killing what comes after the line then?
[12:17:03] <Cork[home]> ya, but its prob resetting the trigger for change
[12:17:20] <Cork[home]> i think ie just doesn't trigger the change event
[12:17:34] <aksnowman> ahh, ok
[12:17:47] <aksnowman> so I'll just get rid of the keyup part, and put it all in the change section
[12:17:59] <aksnowman> won't work quite as perfectly, but will be good enough for our purposes
[12:18:05] <aksnowman> thanks a ton for the help :)
[12:18:52] <Cork[home]> aksnowman: http://jsfiddle.net/DWSUQ/4
[12:19:00] <Cork[home]> yup no change event what so ever
[12:19:29] * Cork[home] takes a note on that
[12:21:39] <zerobeholder> This jsfiddle thing is really slick, http://jsfiddle.net/vT7eH/12/
[12:21:58] <zerobeholder> The regex is ?good?. But it isn't showing up.
[12:25:18] <nVee> can someone please help me here
[12:25:19] <nVee> http://jsfiddle.net/qtA4P/1/
[12:25:41] <Cork[home]> ?.closest @ nVee
[12:25:41] <bot-t> nVee, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:26:07] <Cork[home]> $(this).parent("tr") won't match anything
[12:26:22] <nVee> :/
[12:26:30] <nVee> how else do I do it?
[12:26:39] <nVee> please help me I really dont understand why not
[12:26:40] <Cork[home]> see the link bot-t gave you
[12:26:53] <Cork[home]> just above my comment :)
[12:26:55] <nVee> i tried closest
[12:27:03] <nVee> it returned null as well
[12:27:14] <nVee> I said closest "<tr>"
[12:27:16] <nVee> well
[12:27:21] <nVee> closest("tr")
[12:27:24] <nVee> to be exact

[12:29:18] <misutowolf> Okay, so
[12:29:19] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/GC2mp/10/
[12:29:31] <misutowolf> The effect (toggling) works great, but it still doesn't function outside JSFiddle, no idea why.
[12:29:57] <pawl> i was trying to put the fullcalendar on my jquery mobile page, but it won't load.. i'm thinking it's a problem with ajax and the document.ready javascript code
[12:30:00] <pawl> any quick fixes?
[12:30:37] <misutowolf> The ready event refuses to trigger it seems outside JSFiddle. =/
[12:30:52] <shoky> refuses?
[12:31:58] <Acrack> anyone know a good bbcode thingy with jquery ?
[12:32:11] <Acrack> a light one if possible
[12:33:14] <Raydiation> am i doing anything wrong? it doesnt excute the alert: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/584247/
[12:34:17] <misutowolf> Well, i guess it's not refusing to do it, but either way, it's not working locally.
[12:35:26] <misutowolf> it doesn't make sense why the ready/load event won't trigger
[12:35:34] <misutowolf> what would cause that?  :(
[12:37:41] <Raydiation> damn it, i used <link> tags for sourcing js
[12:39:30] <Joeytje50> what was the syntax to select only the xth match of a selector?
[12:39:45] <tw2113> nth-child ?
[12:39:46] <Joeytje50> so instead of $('.test')[0] what was the correct syntax?
[12:40:08] <Joeytje50> because $('.test')[0].html() won't work
[12:40:27] <Joeytje50> but I saw a way that does work somewhere, but I can't remember what it was
[12:41:12] <LessSeen> Joeytje50: this? $('.test:first').html()

[12:59:34] <bjensen> Shouldn't   $('.modal-btn').unbind("click") remove all click handlers on the elements with the modal-btn class?
[12:59:55] <bjensen> I assigned them using $(".modal-btn").click()

[13:01:50] <thomedy> http://www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[13:02:04] <redfox> google translate is not very helpful
[13:02:09] <systemfault> CaoYoussef: "Warranty is void is the seal of broken"

[13:02:22] <thomedy> you will notice that if you click on an arrow it moves 2x

[13:07:06] <thomedy> not a very busy room right
[13:09:19] <bjensen> http://pastie.org/3818817 can someone please tell me why the .off isn't working? the previous event handlers aren't removed :-/
[13:12:43] <kolix> hey guys
[13:12:50] <kolix> I'm going to use the jquery plugin
[13:13:01] <bjensen> ffjdskafjkdsaf
[13:13:16] <kolix> how do i submit post data without halting the execution of code? i.e. run in the background?
[13:13:37] <bjensen> $('body').off("click", ".modal-btn") doesn't disable the events Ive assigned using  $('body').on('click', '.modal-btn'
[13:13:39] <systemfault> kolix: You serialize the form with .serialize() then send the data with ajax
[13:13:56] <systemfault> kolix: The form must not contain file inputs though..
[13:17:18] <kolix> systemfault, no
[13:17:30] <kolix> I guess what I'm looking for is asynchronously requests
[13:18:00] <kolix> i have an option select, and on the onchange event i need to update/save the data in a mysql database
[13:18:44] <kolix> BUT, i do not want to halt/wait for the ajax function to finish before the user is allowed tod o anything else, i just want it to do it's thing silently in the background
[13:18:49] <DJ_Conner> $.post is asynchronous by default http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:18:50] <kolix> this is asynchronous request, correct?
[13:19:05] <DJ_Conner> shouldn't keep the user from doing anything
[13:19:28] <DJ_Conner> it'll only wait to execute code you pass as a callback to $.post
[13:19:28] <systemfault> Yes...
[13:19:36] <systemfault> What do you think the A means in AJAX :(
[13:19:44] <DJ_Conner> which one? ;)
[13:19:55] <Theowning> ha
[13:23:13] <tehfedaykin> i have a jquery ui issue - has anyone ever had issues with the slide effect and the direction being "down" specifically?
[13:23:17] <DJ_Conner> bjensen: you might need to post a longer example
[13:23:49] <raj> is there a nice, compact script that'll allow me to clear a textarea as expected when clicked inside, and it'll put the original text back when clickoutside occurs (unless any new text is entered)
[13:24:06] <raj> and input
[13:24:18] <systemfault> raj: Search for a html5 placeholder polyfill
[13:24:30] <systemfault> I don't know any "by heart"
[13:25:33] <Whirl3d> What is everyone's preferred "reset" css or equivalent?
[13:26:02] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/
[13:26:25] <Whirl3d> perfect! Thanks ajpiano
[13:29:55] <raj> systemfault, why doesn't that count as the one you know by heart?
[13:30:10] <unclemantis> how do i test of Jquery is loading using the browser address bar?
[13:30:14] <unclemantis> i am using chrome
[13:30:29] <systemfault> unclemantis: You would use the dev chrome tools
[13:30:43] <systemfault> unclemantis: In the "script" tab, you can see all the scripts that were loaded
[13:30:46] <unclemantis> ok, using them what do i do? I have looked and i can't find anything.
[13:30:56] <unclemantis> i don't think i see it loading
[13:31:01] <systemfault> Must be some typo in your html I guess :(
[13:31:06] <Validatorian> I'm trying to add a click handler to an element on plus.google.com (the 'share what's new...' dialog at the top ($('.e-dd')), but it seems the my click handler won't fire (mousedown fires, but not click or mouseup) - anyone have any ideas on how to bind with click?
[13:31:11] <unclemantis> i just want to be sure by sending a test command
[13:31:20] <DJ_Conner> type $ into the console
[13:31:29] <DJ_Conner> $('body') should get you the body tag
[13:31:31] <raj> systemfault, this is great
[13:31:35] <raj> I wish I knew about this earlire
[13:31:36] <DJ_Conner> if jquery is loaded
[13:31:37] <raj> earlier
[13:31:45] <raj> can I style the placeholder text to make it darker?
[13:31:59] <unclemantis> it returned the body html
[13:32:28] <unclemantis> i am trying to debug why twitter-bootstrap dropdown works in development but when i deploy it and view it on my browser it doesn't work
[13:32:30] <DJ_Conner> then jquery is likely loaded, and you should see jquery.min.js (or something like that) in the script that like systemfault said
[13:33:12] <systemfault> Validatorian: If the button in is an iframe, you won't be able to attach an handler on it because it's a different domain
[13:33:36] <Validatorian> systemfault: It's for an extension, so I have full access to the DOM
[13:33:41] <systemfault> ahhh, sorry
[13:33:46] <Validatorian> np, should have specified
[13:34:27] <raj> systemfault, this thing requires a lot of crap
[13:34:37] <Validatorian> I think something on google is unbinding my click handler -- is there any way to ensure a handler does not get unbound?
[13:35:14] <raj> jquery, modernizr, fontresize,jquery-resize, requestanimatinoframe polyfill
[13:35:20] <systemfault> raj:  https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills
[13:35:35] <systemfault> raj: There's like 10 of them on that page..
[13:36:15] <raj> which do you prefer systemfault ?
[13:37:57] <systemfault> raj: I don't really use placeholders…
[13:38:03] <raj> why not?
[13:38:24] <systemfault> Because I never needed them so far..
[13:38:31] <systemfault> I mean, I have nothing against them…
[13:38:34] <thomano> banned for what? good sound?
[13:38:48] <systemfault> systemfault: The first one seems nice
[13:38:54] <systemfault> Err
[13:38:58] <systemfault> raj: :/
[13:39:48] <thomano> banned for what? good sound?
[13:40:00] <raj> systemfault, this list you linked me is a lot more than what I'm looking for
[13:40:10] <raj> it includes links for hash and a million other things :)
[13:40:21] <thomano> banned for what? good sound?
[13:40:41] <nFFF> raj, you could write that script in around 10 seconds yoursel
[13:40:49] <nFFF> I doubt one exists
[13:40:53] <thomano> banned for what? good sound?
[13:41:06] <raj> nFFF, but if browsers have it natively built in, wouldn't that be better?
[13:41:16] <raj> accessibility-wise, perhaps
[13:42:34] <DJ_Conner> raj: you can use the html placeholder attribute in all modern browsers
[13:42:34] <DJ_Conner> http://caniuse.com/input-placeholder
[13:43:48] <DJ_Conner> html5please.com recommends this polyfill: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder
[13:43:54] <DJ_Conner> to support older browsers
[13:44:08] <systemfault> Lulz… Exactly what I suggested :(
[13:44:09] <raj> DJ_Conner, but I like the idea of fallbacks for older browsers
[13:45:18] <raj> cool, I like
[13:46:05] <DJ_Conner> systemfault: my bad, i didn't actually look at which one you picked
[13:46:24] <systemfault> DJ_Conner: It's not your fault :/
[13:46:36] <jeffsmykil> is there some sort of app or script that i can enter a url in and it opens that url in a number of diferent browsers all at once?
[13:47:30] <DJ_Conner> maybe this: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/shadow.html
[13:47:43] <DJ_Conner> mainly for mobile though
[13:48:08] <m3t4> is posible get multiple parameters from one id atribute using attr function ?
[13:48:56] <systemfault> m3t4: That doesn't make sense :/ an ID is a unique single value…
[13:49:52] <m3t4> hm..
[13:59:34] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!!!! :))))))
[14:00:40] <Whirl3d> Hello, mr. I did too much prozac today.
[14:00:52] <Lurzino> anyone could tell me if I can use .dialog() without applying any theme but just calling that <div> block I made and already styled as a dialog window?
[14:01:15] <zerobeholder> I am going home a happy man, the search box works...
[14:01:18] <zerobeholder> http://jsfiddle.net/vT7eH/26/
[14:01:35] <systemfault> Lurzino: Your problem is probably the main reason why I hate jQueryUI so much.
[14:02:10] <Lurzino> systemfault uhm do you have a possible alternative suggest?
[14:02:12] <zerobeholder> I felt pretty alone these last three hours, but I doesn't really matter.
[14:02:23] <biberao> byebye
[14:02:27] <zerobeholder> Thanks for the help I did get...
[14:02:29] <systemfault> Lurzino: At work.. I just use fancybox 2 nowadays… far more flexible.
[14:02:52] <Lurzino> fancybox 2 ?
[14:03:13] <Lurzino> it is something similar to dialog() stuff?
[14:03:21] <kolix> hi guys quick question
[14:03:28] <Whirl3d> Did someone just waft a big ole stinky cloud of imposed guilt for implied negligence in this room?
[14:03:48] <systemfault> Lurzino: It's a overlay plugin… http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/
[14:04:17] <systemfault> kolix: Your question is not that quick… right?
[14:04:21] <Lurzino> ok lemme take a look a bit... thank you, systemfault :))))
[14:04:32] * Lurzino hands a fresh beer to systemfault
[14:05:03] <kolix> so this is my code
[14:05:04] <kolix> http://pastie.org/3819144
[14:05:09] <zerobeholder> No, I wouldn't have gotten it period. If it weren't for the help earlier.
[14:05:37] <kolix> is that how the jqeury ajax function works?
[14:06:00] <zerobeholder> And I am grateful for it.
[14:06:24] <dogarrhea2> Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'html'
[14:06:32] <systemfault> kolix: Pretty much yes… but you have no "handlers"
[14:06:39] <kolix> what are handlers?
[14:06:57] <kolix> do i send "POST" variables like GET paramters?
[14:07:02] <zerobeholder> Somebody suggested I use a function and match. And once I stopped using .match wrong I was able to get the final workings right enough so that the users won't know it's all hacked together...
[14:07:20] <systemfault> kolix: Your code calls the page you specified with "url" but you don't verify if it failed or succeed
[14:07:29] <kolix> ok
[14:07:32] <kolix> that was my next question
[14:07:35] <kolix> how do i do this?
[14:07:51] <Dr-Bombay> what do you mean "like GET parameters"
[14:08:19] <systemfault> kolix: $.ajax({configuration like you did here}).done(function(data) { console.log('success'); }).fail(function() { console.log('fffffuuuuuuuu'); });
[14:08:33] <kolix> haha
[14:08:51] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: GET parameters are part of the query string
[14:09:18] <Dr-Bombay> never ind, I thought you said "how do i send"
[14:09:22] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[14:09:41] <kolix> sweet it works
[14:09:43] <kolix> !!
[14:09:44] <kolix> awesome
[14:10:04] <systemfault> kolix: Wonderful :)
[14:12:14] <kolix> thanks
[14:13:22] <gf3> NO U
[14:14:06] <simmerz> HI, is it possible to know when the fx queue has run out of things to do?
[14:14:58] <thomedy> is this room occupado or no one working in here
[14:15:32] <systemfault> Or everyone is working...
[14:15:45] <zerobeholder> Well, night all. I think I am going to go from retarded to super retarded tonight-- you didn't think it was possible. But less thinking from now until bedtime.
[14:18:02] <Raydiation> do i have to use a full domain for a websocket? cant i just say var exampleSocket = new WebSocket("ws:///socketserver");  
[14:18:16] <Raydiation> i mean use the same domain as the site
[14:35:42] <JakeCattrall> almost double the people in here then in #javascript :|
[14:37:21] <tw2113> does that make you sad where it counts?
[14:38:56] <gf3> IN THE BUTT
[14:39:15] <jaha> How can I URL encode a JSON string?
[14:39:27] <jaha> that will work with $.load()
[14:39:48] <jaha> ex: {"type":"video"}
[14:40:01] <Whirl3d> gnite zerob
[14:40:07] <gf3> jaha: You can pass $.load an object
[14:40:16] <gf3> jaha: No need to encode
[14:40:21] <jaha> gf3: i need to use GET
[14:40:33] <gf3> jaha: That's fine
[14:40:40] <Whirl3d> is there any way to distrbute the space between elements using css or do I have to use jquery?
[14:40:46] <gf3> jaha: Just pass it your data, it'll take care of it for you
[14:41:03] <jaha> oh… well…..damn…. haha ill try
[14:41:08] <gf3> Whirl3d: You can use percentages w/ CSS
[14:42:16] <Whirl3d> So I'd set padding to (100/(2*#elements)-1) % ?
[14:43:12] <gf3> Also: box-sizing: border-box; is your friend
[14:43:36] <Whirl3d> never heard of it. What is that?
[14:44:08] <gf3> It's awesome.
[14:45:40] <systemfault> It was unusable in real projects before… before it doesn't work on Ie7
[14:46:01] <tw2113> IE7 isn't usable
[14:46:08] <systemfault> But If you don't need to support it, border-box gives use at last a non-retarded box model
[14:46:31] <systemfault> tw2113: But people use that shitty browser… so a lot of companies have to support it
[14:46:42] <tw2113> they're all doing it wrong
[14:46:51] <systemfault> Who?
[14:46:55] <systemfault> Companies who want money?
[14:46:59] <tw2113> everyone still on that browsers
[14:47:04] <systemfault> Ahh, right
[14:49:57] <simmerz> is there a way to determine when an effects queue has reached the point where it has no more effects to perform?
[14:50:09] <Axsuul> How can I use .on() to achieve .load().. $(document).on('load', '#foo', ...) doesn't appear to work
[14:50:37] <DJ_Conner> you want $(document).ready(function(){//statements});
[14:50:52] <Whirl3d> simmerz, I'm sure there is a better way, but you could always do a 0 duration animation with a complete callback
[14:51:21] <simmerz> Whirl3d: that's an interesting idea. Hadn't thought of that one
[14:51:28] <simmerz> it'd work at least
[14:51:55] <Whirl3d> But I think you can just use .promise()
[14:52:20] <Whirl3d> which will resolve immediately if there is nothing in the fx queue.
[14:52:49] <Whirl3d> But I am still really unclear about all that...someone in here will know for sure though
[14:54:04] <simmerz> ah, promise() looks more interesting. thanks for the pointer. I'll have a play
[14:54:46] <Axsuul> DJ_Conner: i'm trying to bind to when an image is loaded
[14:56:05] <Carlitta87> am i allowed to assign a variable like this "item = $('#TextBoxesGroup').html(response);"?
[14:56:58] <gf3> ?tias @ Carlitta87
[14:56:59] <bot-t> Carlitta87, Try It And See
[14:58:22] <Gates> I have a nav menu with 3 menu items, each of the 3 have 3 subs menu items
[14:58:32] <Gates> how can i make the sub fold up and defaul hidden
[14:58:33] <DJ_Conner> oh i see...i think you can use .load directly on a $('img'), but i'm not sure, sorry
[14:58:36] <Gates> and show hen click?
[14:58:37] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/
[14:58:38] <Gates> heres a fiddle
[14:59:16] <Gates> I feel like this is really easy but im feeling dumb
[14:59:24] <jaha> gf3: looks like as soon as you pass .load data it uses the POST method
[14:59:49] <gf3> jaha: Have you tried $.get ?
[15:00:11] <Gates> actaully maybe i know it >.<
[15:00:25] <jcp_> which of these is better: http://jsfiddle.net/JnHWC/1/
[15:00:46] <gf3> jcp_: They're the same
[15:01:21] <jcp_> ya, but i mean, two ways to do the same thing… is it simply stylistic preference?
[15:01:26] <jcp_> or perhaps there's more to it
[15:01:28] <gf3> Yes
[15:01:33] <gf3> Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
[15:01:44] <jcp_> cool thanks
[15:03:36] <Gates> Rather
[15:03:38] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/
[15:03:44] <Gates> Why doesnt this hide/show work :\
[15:05:14] <Gates> augh
[15:05:33] <Whirl3d> is ":hidden" a valid pseudo-selector?
[15:05:45] <gf3> Define valid
[15:05:57] <raj> does it work?
[15:06:04] <gf3> It works in jQuery
[15:06:04] <Whirl3d> if ($(el).is(":hidden"))  {do something
[15:06:12] <gf3> It's not a real pseudo-selector
[15:06:22] <Whirl3d> Gates, that's your answer
[15:06:46] <raj> how is it not a real psuedo-selector?
[15:07:00] <Whirl3d> Gates, try $("#nav li ul").is(":visible") { do stuff} else { do stuff}
[15:07:10] <systemfault> raj: Because it's a jquery-ism...
[15:07:14] <ajpiano> is returns a booleans bros
[15:07:23] <ajpiano> oh yea with if
[15:07:34] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, sorry in his code he has the if.
[15:07:37] <Gates> Whirl3d: its so weird, i cannot like its making weird errors
[15:07:51] <Gates> like if i try to pre-hide it, it shows 2 not 3
[15:08:50] <Gates> ..the problem is theres too many elements?
[15:09:19] <Gates> it has to be? $(this + "li ul") ?
[15:09:31] <Gates> the sub of "this"
[15:09:47] <gf3> Gates: Do you mean $(this).find("…")
[15:09:48] <gf3> ?
[15:09:53] <Gates> no
[15:09:56] <Gates> look at this code
[15:09:59] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/
[15:10:36] <Gates> when u click on of the "ul li a" it should show the "ul li ul"
[15:11:15] <ML74> Could anyone help me with the image scrolling plugin on http://www.designbyml.com/photogems/ ? There's 10 <li> elements yet it only throws 3 images in.
[15:11:16] <simmerz> Whirl3d: really odd. if i want to call the same animation a few times, and then after the loop I call .promise().done() on one of the elements I've animated, it returns once for every time i've looped through and added the animation to the queue
[15:11:26] <simmerz> I'd have thought it would only return the once for a given queue
[15:11:28] <gf3> Gates: I believe you want to select the sibling UL
[15:11:49] <gf3> Gates: http://jqapi.com/#p=next
[15:12:06] <gf3> Gates: e.g. var $ul = $(this).next("ul")
[15:12:29] <Gates> or i can just put it in the a i guess
[15:13:11] <gf3> With HTML5 you can
[15:15:28] <Gates> gf3: what u mean
[15:15:51] <gf3> Gates: Previously, <a> elements could not contain block-level elements
[15:15:58] <gf3> Gates: But this has been changed in HTML5
[15:17:31] <Gates> well its all html5 so yea
[15:19:29] <Whirl3d> Gates, here is kinda what you want. Maybe a step in the right direction--not sure: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gaHPN/13/
[15:19:34] <catcher> Trying to remove all <tr class="item_row"> elements, anything wrong with $('.item_row').remove();?
[15:19:45] <Whirl3d> oh, I messed up your styling...but you get the idea
[15:20:42] <arguser> hello, i have no idea about js nor jquery, but i want to make something (i think) simple: For every link inside a div, i want them to take a color value A and in every instance, increase that value until it's equal to value B
[15:20:58] <arguser> making sort of a gradient
[15:21:05] <Gates> OMFG
[15:21:12] <gf3> arguser: Interpolation
[15:21:15] <Gates> Whirl3d: the reason my didnt work is because i didnt have easing script included
[15:21:17] <Gates> thus it couldnt ease
[15:21:21] <Gates> -_______-
[15:21:40] <jcp_> Gates: this is how i'd do it: http://jsfiddle.net/gaHPN/14/
[15:21:51] <Whirl3d> simmerz, like I said, I'm not an expert here on deferred's but perhaps just before you loop, create a deferred object and then on your last animation resolve the deferred
[15:21:54] <arguser> gf3: any example of something similar?
[15:22:17] <jcp_> well i removed easing but you can just add that
[15:22:33] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/
[15:22:37] <Gates> I got it to work
[15:22:37] <Gates> BUT
[15:22:44] <Gates> its openning BOTH not just ONE
[15:22:44] <gf3> arguser: The google will help you learn about interpolating colours
[15:22:52] <Whirl3d> Gates, you forgot to close one UL
[15:22:54] <Gates> yea
[15:22:59] <Gates> why cant i do
[15:23:06] <Gates> $(this + "ul")
[15:23:12] <Whirl3d> sry you mustive fixed it
[15:23:14] <ML74> Could anyone help me with the image scrolling plugin on http://www.designbyml.com/photogems/ ? There's 10 <li> elements yet it only throws 3 images in.
[15:23:18] <arguser> gf3: ok, jquery is the right tool for this?
[15:23:27] <Whirl3d> $(this).find("ul");
[15:23:31] <gf3> arguser: Sure
[15:23:40] <Gates> thnx
[15:23:48] <Gates> Whirl3d: thnx
[15:24:07] <arguser> gf3: thanks :)
[15:24:21] <Whirl3d> and if you click on a sub element, it closes all sub menus. Was that intended?
[15:24:25] <Gates> there we go :]
[15:24:36] <arkascha> Go a probem with jquery::chosen: I have a clean html select with 3 options. I call chosen(...) on it, but it reanders like readonly string.
[15:24:37] <arkascha> When I check the generated source I can see that the chzn-drop exists, but does not hold any entries in the ul-list.
[15:24:42] <Gates> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/
[15:24:45] <arkascha> Anyone willing to give me a hand in this ?
[15:24:46] <Gates> its working, thnx
[15:25:41] <arkascha> here is the html: http://paste.opensuse.org/32050374
[15:25:57] <Gates> Whirl3d: wait youre right
[15:26:04] <Whirl3d> Gates, it might still be a good idea to investgate apply .on to this solution
[15:26:31] <Whirl3d> THen you have one handler for your menu (not one per button) and you have much more uniform control over the menu's appearance
[15:26:41] <arkascha> here is the js call: $('.shorty-dialog select').chosen();
[15:28:37] <wodemaye__> and does php soft quoting get thrown off by a jquery selector? echo "$('div.$actual_php_var_with_div_class_name')......jqcodelsdljkalsdfkjasdklfj";
[15:29:10] <arkascha> This is the generated html I get: http://paste.opensuse.org/968765
[15:29:29] <arkascha> anyone got an idea what I am doing wrong ?
[15:29:58] <Gates> Whirl3d: well crap
[15:30:09] <Gates> what was needed from - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/17/
[15:30:12] <Gates> to make the sub links work
[15:30:27] <Gates> the 2nd line of javascript NEEDS to be "#nav ul li a" not "#nav ul li"
[15:30:46] <Gates> so then the next line needs to font the "ul" that is a sibling not a child
[15:31:58] <Gates> parent().find maybe?
[15:32:36] <ML74> Could anyone help me with the image scrolling plugin on http://www.designbyml.com/photogems/ ? There's 10 <li> elements yet it only throws 3 images in.
[15:33:30] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/22/
[15:33:32] <Gates> why doesnt that work :\
[15:33:34] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gaHPN/21/
[15:33:35] <jcp_> ML74: not even sure what you're referencing on that site
[15:33:50] <ML74> jcp_: on the right sidebar
[15:33:57] <raj> is there something similar to nextUntil([selector]) that includes the selected element?
[15:34:11] <ML74> the three images that are sitting stationary at the minute are meant to scroll horizontally across
[15:34:30] <Whirl3d> Gates, it appears to work on mine (your link that is)
[15:34:45] <raj> i basically want the very next selected element, from the element I'm currently at
[15:34:46] <jcp_> ML74 under latest events? i see scrolling images…
[15:34:52] <ML74> yeah
[15:34:54] <Gates> Whirl3d: no cuz the sub pages dont work
[15:34:55] <ML74> what browser?
[15:34:59] <jcp_> chrome what are you using
[15:35:02] <raj> although there are 3 other elements with that selector, I want only the very next one
[15:35:08] <Gates> Whirl3d: here is YOUR code, all i editted was the HMTL => http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/23/
[15:35:14] <raj> i'd rather not do .next().next().next().next()
[15:35:14] <jcp_> ML74: you have a bunch of js errors too. prob want to fix those
[15:35:49] <raj> i want to automatically do .next('.myselectedelement) until myselectedelement shows up
[15:36:05] <Whirl3d> Gates, isn't that what you were looking for?
[15:36:18] <ML74> jcp_: where are js errors?
[15:36:36] <Gates> The sub links do not actaully work now
[15:36:46] <Gates> it needs to expand yes, but the sublinks need to go to a url as well
[15:36:48] <jcp_> ML74: i'm looking in chrome's console…
[15:36:54] <Whirl3d> You just need to add the handler for them. Sorry. one minute
[15:37:05] <Gates> Whirl3d: / ML74: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gaHPN/22/
[15:37:07] <ML74> same. i just see two 404 error sand something about YAHOO?
[15:37:11] <Gates> that works except the sub
[15:37:26] <Gates> Whirl3d: why isnt it auto handled :\
[15:37:50] <jcp_> ML74: ya, that's what i mean. anyways, your scroller isn't working anymore. it was a minute ago though
[15:38:12] <Whirl3d> I put the return false in the general scope of the 'on' statement. That prohibits the default action
[15:38:18] <ML74> jcp_ i didn't change anything...
[15:38:31] <Relter> Hi guys. I was wondering if someone knows how to make buttons for "next/previous" in js/jquery. (check out the  menu to the left) madvertising.no/ultimaterainfall/html/
[15:38:42] <Whirl3d> move the lower return false to just below slideUp (inside the if submenu.length
[15:39:39] <Gates> Whirl3d: yes but its at a differnt level
[15:39:48] <Gates> the link for the expand is "ul li a"
[15:39:55] <Gates> the sub links are "ul li ul li a"
[15:40:10] <Whirl3d> doesn't matter. they bubble up
[15:40:16] <Gates> prob easier just make it a span instead of a href
[15:40:18] <Gates> for the parents
[15:40:21] <Whirl3d> this allows you to have lots of submenus
[15:40:21] <jcp_> ML74: you also have an extra }); in there
[15:40:30] <Gates> Whirl3d: bleh
[15:40:43] <Whirl3d> doesn't mean you have to have submenus
[15:41:19] <Gates> Whirl3d: yea, so how to i force it to work?
[15:41:37] <Gates> "add the handler for them"
[15:41:46] <Gates> if u are doing it for me, sorry and thank you!
[15:41:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/gaHPN/26/
[15:42:09] <Gates> youre amazing
[15:42:10] <Whirl3d> It won't actuall go because of jsfiddle
[15:42:16] <Gates> doesnt work =[
[15:42:20] <Gates> oh
[15:42:28] <Gates> but if i hold cmd and click
[15:42:29] <Gates> ..it does
[15:42:40] <Whirl3d> try it outside of jsfiddle
[15:42:42] <Gates> which proves it works
[15:42:43] <raj> there's a way to get a boolean for a checkbox, if I recall correctly
[15:42:53] <raj> instead of "on"
[15:42:55] <raj> for its value
[15:42:57] <jcp_> prop('checked')
[15:43:01] <raj> yeahhh
[15:43:02] <raj> prop
[15:43:03] <raj> thanks
[15:43:27] <Whirl3d> raj....on is an event handler not a way of checking properties of things.
[15:43:53] <raj> Whirl3d, i mean .val() returns "on"
[15:45:33] <Gates> Whirl3d: yes thank you so much
[15:45:42] <Gates> can i buy u a beer?
[15:46:23] <Whirl3d> That's sweet of you to offer. Just give back to the community when you can. Help someone else when you got some free time.
[15:47:27] <ML74> jcp_: any idea how to fix the YAHOO error? :/
[15:48:24] <ML74> jcp_: Also, the scroll works when it's loaded first time. If i refresh, goes back to 3 images. WTF lol
[15:49:00] <nocturne7> this code prevents the checkbox from being checked but executes the assign events correctly http://jsfiddle.net/w7eFb/
[15:49:03] <jcp_> ML74: did you get calendar.js from somewhere? I think you need yahoo's ui library
[15:49:09] <nocturne7> assigned*
[15:49:26] <ML74> jcp_: i can't remember. pulled it off a website i made a year ago :/
[15:49:46] <jcp_> ML74: maybe add in yahoo's ui lib and see if it goes away (before the calendar.js script)
[15:49:54] <jcp_> or get a new plugin lol
[15:50:10] <ML74> lol ok
[15:51:32] <Gates> Whirl3d: alway do, thnx again
[15:53:08] <ML74> jcp_: Have a look at console now :/
[15:53:32] <jcp_> lol
[15:53:38] <jcp_> never did like yahoo :P
[15:53:53] <raj> i'm looping over some elements with .each() and adding values to an object via abc['thing1'] = $(el).val(); abc['thing2'] = $(el).next().val()... etc. And then (within .each() function), I do motherload.push(abc)...but I always only get shown duplicates of the very last element iterated over
[15:54:04] <raj> cuz its using the reference
[15:54:11] <Gates> Whirl3d: would u be able to help me with a small css quesiton related to that script?
[15:54:17] <raj> but how can I get it to actually do what I'm expecting
[15:54:18] <raj> ?
[15:54:38] <jcp_> ML74: do you need calendar.js for anything? if not, just removed it
[15:54:58] <ML74> hmmmm… i thought i did. but now you mention it, no lol
[15:55:16] <jcp_> ya get rid of that and yui also move your scripts to the bottom
[15:58:08] <IconicSchema> http://jsbin.firejune.com/CnC/13/edit#preview
[15:58:21] <IconicSchema> :D
[15:58:48] <Relter> Is there any chance anyone would help a helpless designer with a website problem? :P
[15:59:30] <ML74> jcp_: any idea what the problem is with the refresh thing?
[15:59:37] <dwarder> is JQuery.proxy like apply function?
[15:59:59] <systemfault> dwarder: More of less.. instead of calling, it returns a function with bound arguments
[16:00:42] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a reason why tables aren't sortable with jQuery UI?  they always go back to their old position ?
[16:00:48] <dwarder> systemfault: thanks
[16:01:03] <FunnyLookinHat> i.e. $('#wrapper > table').sortable({axis:'y'}); keeps resetting them after I am done dragging
[16:01:28] <Whirl3d> Gates, I am the worst at CSS, but I can try. I'm walking out the door, so ask quick
[16:02:08] <FunnyLookinHat> oh
[16:02:09] <FunnyLookinHat> I did it wrong.
[16:02:10] <FunnyLookinHat> LOL
[16:02:33] <Whirl3d> raj, look at .map
[16:02:39] <Gates> Whirl3d: i got it, i knew it but i got it thnx
[16:02:45] <raj> Whirl3d, can't be done the way I'd like?
[16:02:48] <raj> (without map)
[16:02:49] <Gates> making the parent ul not hover, got it
[16:03:29] <Whirl3d> .map is what you are looking for. It's like .each  in so much as it loops, but it allows you to return a value for each element. Then combine the values AFTER done looping
[16:04:01] <raj> Whirl3d, ok, fine
[16:04:03] <nocturne7> solved the problem with $.change
[16:04:08] <raj> but how can it be done with .each?
[16:04:13] <raj> i've done it before, just don't remember how
[16:04:37] <raj> like, if I wasn't using jquery, how would I do it with a for-loop?
[16:04:39] <Whirl3d> Sorry. I'm not gonna play "how do I fit a round peg in a square hole for fun" I gotta run. Maybe later
[16:05:25] <Gates> lol
[16:05:29] <raj> that makes no sense
[16:05:33] <Gates> yes it does
[16:05:36] <raj> no, it doesn't
[16:05:39] <raj> what if I wasn't using jquery
[16:05:53] <Gates> it deosnt matter cuz it works
[16:05:57] <Gates> then you wouldnt be in this channel
[16:06:08] <dwarder> what does it mean: this.items = this.items || $();
[16:06:13] <dwarder> ?
[16:06:53] <raj> Gates, that's a dumb reason too
[16:07:00] <raj> stop being a follower
[16:07:04] <systemfault> this.item is equal to this.item if it's not falsy or else it's equal to the result of $()
[16:07:38] <dwarder> systemfault: what is $() ?
[16:08:03] <systemfault> dwarder: An empty jquery function call..
[16:08:15] <dwarder> hmm
[16:08:22] <dwarder> what the point?
[16:08:32] <systemfault> dwarder: Returns an empty jquery object.
[16:08:39] <dwarder> ohh i se
[16:08:40] <dwarder> e
[16:09:05] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to remove .sortable() ?  Or once it's set it's there until the page reloads ?
[16:09:13] <dwarder> thank you
[16:09:20] <systemfault> dwarder: You're welcome.
[16:10:33] <Gates> raj: u man
[16:10:39] <Gates> umad? **
[16:10:48] <raj> huh?
[16:29:38] <catcher> Is there any reason I shouldn't be able to modify elements that are display:none ?
[16:29:44] <hacks> I'm building an extension. How do I know if a variable is a jquery object or just a regular element DOM object?
[16:33:47] <devOlsen> use the typeof operator hacks.
[16:34:02] <hacks> devOlsen: example?
[16:34:08] <devOlsen> if(typeof var == 'object'){}
[16:37:31] <Krinkle> catcher: should work just fine
[16:38:24] <catcher> Krinkle, think I figured it out - there's a brief moment in time when my object doesn't exist, so a new one ends up being made.
[16:38:44] <Krinkle> hacks: The best way I know is one of these three: isjQuery = myVar instanceof jQuery; or isDom = !!myVar.nodeType; or isJQuery = !!myVar.jquery;
[16:38:48] <catcher> I hate to store the contents in a global var, am I better off keeping the element around regardless and keeping it hidden?
[16:39:03] <Krinkle> devOlsen: Both jQuery objects and Dom elements are of type 'object'
[16:39:44] <Krinkle> catcher: I don't see how storing contents in a global var and hiding an element to be manipulated are related, fill me in?
[16:41:12] <catcher> Krinkle, long story, but I'll try - I'm attaching one element to another, and that other is rendered selectively. My element needs to remember its contents across those different ajax loads, while the other does not.
[16:41:46] <Krinkle> define 'attaching'  in this context
[16:41:53] <Krinkle> appending as a child?
[16:42:07] <catcher> Krinkle, proximity only, and currently they're rendered at the same time. Sibling I believe, I'll check
[16:42:31] <Krinkle> how is that related to storing content (what kind of content, html?) in a global variable
[16:42:55] <Krinkle> so aren't storing innerHTML and then innerHTML = old content + newInnerHTML
[16:43:02] <catcher> Krinkle, it's a child of the same container..
[16:43:04] <Krinkle> because that I would consider harmful
[16:43:22] <Krinkle> catcher: okay,cool
[16:43:41] <Krinkle> catcher: Can you maybe show some code on jsfiddle?
[16:43:44] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/
[16:44:05] <catcher> Krinkle, the trick is I need to operate on the html contents of my element while it's not in the DOM (or I need to keep it in the DOM and operate on it while it's hidden)
[16:44:52] <Krinkle> sure, you can do that using detach() and then any of before/after/prepend/append()
[16:45:17] <Krinkle> and if you need to store the content somewhere, you can use a local variable in the callback of whatever asynchronous action you are performing
[16:45:19] <catcher> Krinkle, you'd suggest keeping it in the DOM over the global var option?
[16:46:09] <Krinkle> catcher: There is no rationale whatsoever using a global variable for anything in this case
[16:46:18] <Krinkle> at the very least, make it a local variable in the function you are in
[16:46:24] <Krinkle> why would it have to be global variable?
[16:46:56] <Krinkle> if you are having problems accessing it after the ajax request, use a callback
[16:47:09] <Krinkle> it will make things a lot smoother and easier to follow
[16:47:17] <Krinkle> I can show you if you add a little base to a jsfiddle
[16:47:34] <catcher> Krinkle, ty, I'll see if I can get something going on jsfiddle.
[16:47:49] <Krinkle> alrighty, I'll take a quick snack, ping me :)
[16:48:12] <Krinkle> (or someone else, of course)
[16:52:39] <catcher> Krinkle, I see it now - the parent element I'm inserting mine under does the global variable thing and nullifies the html of the entire container (including my element)
[16:53:18] <catcher> Is there a selector that will grab everything other than a specified child element?
[16:55:58] <Krinkle> catcher: everything as in all direct childs or recursively everything in it
[16:55:58] <Krinkle> (both childs and childs of childs)
[16:56:45] <catcher> I'd like to modify the current container selector to ignore my element, which appears to always be the 2nd child.
[16:56:53] <Krinkle> catcher: $foo.children().not( bar )
[16:57:07] <Krinkle> Or if you have a set already, just $foo.not( bar )
[16:57:17] <Krinkle> that reduces the set to exclude the node(s) in bar
[16:57:58] <catcher> so if I have <foo><bar><bas></bas></bar></foo>, and the selector is #foo, I can do #foo.not(bas)?
[16:58:29] <catcher> Or maybe I could just pull my element out of the container and rework a bit.
[16:58:40] <coldhead> sounds like a plan
[16:58:47] <Krinkle> catcher: No
[16:59:10] <Krinkle> catcher: $( '#foo' ) will give you a jquery collection with 1 node
[16:59:21] <Krinkle> namely the <div id="foo">..</div> node
[16:59:40] <Krinkle> trying to exclude <bas> is pointless as bas is not in the selection
[16:59:43] <catcher> Ah, I see.
[17:00:04] <Krinkle> catcher: I think it's easier if you some something :) it gets blurrier
[17:00:45] <BryanRuiz> $('td input[type="radio"]', $_clone).click(); this means click both elements, right?
[17:00:58] <BryanRuiz> well any elements that match both of those selectors?
[17:00:59] <catcher> Krinkle, I'll try reworking quickly, thanks for the advice.
[17:01:03] <Krinkle> BryanRuiz: No
[17:01:31] <Krinkle> BryanRuiz: That will start with $_clone, then find all <td>s and then find all input-radio's inside that, and it clicks those
[17:01:43] <BryanRuiz> thanks much Krinkle
[17:01:51] <Krinkle> BryanRuiz: Better write $_clone.find('td input[type="radio"]').click()
[17:01:56] <Krinkle> same thing but easier to read
[17:02:01] <BryanRuiz> agreed
[17:02:12] <Krinkle> (and slightly faster too!)
[17:02:21] <BryanRuiz> wow, double whamy
[17:02:29] <Krinkle> yeah B)
[17:08:08] <catcher> Krinkle, coldhead, already behaving as expected, now to get the thing positioned back where it was :-P
[17:08:42] <hacks> .children(0) get the first index?
[17:13:26] <spoonybard> http://jsfiddle.net/HQemc/ text() is giving me all the text but i only want the text in the td tag. how do i go about doing that?
[17:13:34] <Krinkle> ?eq | hacks
[17:13:35] <bot-t> Krinkle, .eq() - Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:13:49] <Krinkle> ?eq @ hacks
[17:13:49] <bot-t> hacks, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:14:04] <Krinkle> ?children

[17:14:13] <hacks> Krinkle: ok
[17:16:13] <dkdang> need help with jquery ui autocomplete. tried google, can't pinpoint my isse :(
[17:17:18] <dkdang> i can get jquery ui autocomplete working but requires json with "label" result
[17:17:35] <dkdang> my php for autocomplete pulls data directly from mysql using field names
[17:17:41] <Krinkle> dkdang: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[17:17:46] <dkdang> no field name called label
[17:17:46] <Krinkle> what format are you using?
[17:17:50] <dkdang> json
[17:18:02] <dkdang> field name i want displayed is ProdCODE
[17:18:03] <Krinkle> I mean what source format
[17:18:12] <Krinkle> ['foo', 'bar']
[17:18:21] <Krinkle> [ "Choice1", "Choice2" ]
[17:18:25] <Krinkle> [ { label: "Choice1", value: "value1" }, ... ]
[17:18:27] <Krinkle> one of those two
[17:18:39] <Krinkle> if you have a different format, use a function callback, and transform it into that
[17:18:45] <dkdang> last one
[17:19:06] <dkdang> according to example i need it in the last format
[17:19:09] <Krinkle> it has to literally be "label" and "value", not some other word
[17:19:11] <dkdang> and label:
[17:19:19] <dkdang> yeah that's what i mean
[17:19:27] <dkdang> is it possible to be something else?
[17:19:30] <Krinkle> if you have a different format, either change your json input or use a callback to format it it into label/value
[17:19:57] <dkdang> or do i need to iterate through json result and change ProdCODE to label?
[17:19:58] <Krinkle> dkdang: can you show the code please?  (jsfiddle.net or pastie.org)
[17:21:13] <dkdang> krinkle sorry don't know how to use either one.
[17:21:24] <dkdang> it's basically an exact copy of the demo you linked
[17:21:35] <Krinkle> dkdang: it doesn't have to work, just dump the code :)
[17:21:47] <Krinkle> pastie.org is ideal for that sort of thing, just dump
[17:21:47] <BryanRuiz> (i have two text boxes with the same name) and i want to get the value of the text box of the keyup
[17:22:03] <dkdang> krinkle ok php code or json code?
[17:22:07] <dkdang> i'll dump both
[17:22:10] <Krinkle> dkdang: sure
[17:22:59] <BryanRuiz> s/keyup/keyup event/
[17:23:09] <BryanRuiz> how do i do that?
[17:24:03] <dkdang> http://jsfiddle.net/YkAcT/
[17:24:23] <dkdang> it currently looks up php/prodinfo.php?term=RI for example
[17:25:01] <dkdang> and sends results back to other text fields.
[17:25:40] <BryanRuiz> in this defintion of keyup, what does handler mean? .keyup( handler(eventObject) )
[17:26:03] <dkdang> also appends customer code to the lookup as results will depend on the customer
[17:27:19] <Krinkle> dkdang: One totally unrelated piece of advice, start ( and { on the same line as the command, not on the new line. Unlike some languages (like php), in javascript it does matter where you put them, the program can behave broken in cases where semi colons are involved, just pretend the program will throw a SyntaxError exception if you put them on the left on a new line
[17:27:33] <dkdang> krinkle: sorry i'm gonna have to go. i guess i'm gonna have to cycle through php result and change ProdCODE to label. thanks for the heads up.
[17:27:52] <Krinkle> dkdang: http://jsfiddle.net/YkAcT/1/
[17:27:53] <Krinkle> etc.
[17:28:51] <dkdang> cool ok thanks Krinkle.
[17:28:53] <dkdang> bye
[17:28:56] <Krinkle> dkdang: and quote attribute values, foo[id=x] -> foo[id="x"], without them, the selector can break at random
[17:29:02] <Krinkle> alrighty, bye :)
[17:29:19] <dkdang> sorry my javascript knowledge is next to zero!
[17:29:27] <Krinkle> step by step
[17:29:30] <dkdang> looks like i'm gonna have to come back for some schooling from you!
[17:29:34] <dkdang> thanks again
[17:33:49] <BryanRuiz> jquery says that this was added in 1.43, but I cnat seem to use eventData?  .keyup( [eventData], handler(eventObject) )
[17:33:54] <BryanRuiz> im using it like this:
[17:34:23] <BryanRuiz>  $('voucher-recipient-name').change(eventData, function(eventObject){ console.log(eventData) });
[17:34:36] <savid> When I use jquery-ui-dialog,  it overrides a ton of styles within my dialog box.  For example, my site-wide font, link colors, etc.  How can I make it so that it doesn't override those?
[17:35:06] <savid> I don't want to have to re-define all the styles in my CSS
[17:36:54] <hacks> does jquery add fallbacks to the input event for older browsers?
[17:38:40] <syborg> hacks: define older browsers
[17:39:07] <syborg> jquery works with IE 6+, ff 3.6+ opera, and chrome
[17:39:33] <hacks> syborg: duh IE
[17:39:48] <hacks> The browsers that don't support oninput
[17:39:59] <catcher> reminder what === is?
[17:40:34] <syborg> catcher: values must be equal in type as well as value
[17:40:41] <catcher> right, ty
[17:41:39] <StevenCodes> don't really know if this is stupid question or not but are jsfiddles useable like the code is it legal to use
[17:44:04] <beancurd> what do you mean.
[17:44:26] <Whirl3d> evening all. can you extend "location" using location.prototype?
[17:44:47] <StevenCodes> beancurd,  Like if i use examples off there and change the code can i use that code online
[17:46:29] <Stew-a> how can i create a selector for the attribute yt:name without it throwing an error?
[17:46:50] <Whirl3d> yt:name?
[17:47:13] <ML74> Could some one help me with the image scroller here: http://designbyml.com/photogems/ ? It works fine when I first load the page, but if I refresh it stops working.
[17:47:15] <Stew-a> i get an error saying 'unrecognised expression [yt:name=...]'
[17:47:25] <Whirl3d> what is yt:name?
[17:47:58] <Stew-a> it's an attribute on an element in an xml document
[17:48:18] <Whirl3d> so, it's not a standard html element?
[17:48:38] <Stew-a> no
[17:49:09] <Whirl3d> Then, I can't help you. I don't know that jquery selects for non-standard elements.
[17:49:30] <billygalbreath> i heard jquery doesnt work right with xml
[17:49:35] <billygalbreath> but i might have heard wrong
[17:50:02] <Whirl3d> I am sure there are plugins that parse xml, but right out the box...I don't think it's equipped to do it.
[17:50:08] <Stew-a> ah ok, i was under the impression i could use it to handle xml fetched over ajax, but i guess i was mistaken
[17:50:27] <billygalbreath> Stew-a: i believe the standard practice is to use json
[17:50:30] <Whirl3d> You can parse it into an object and then maninpulate it with jquery
[17:51:36] <beancurd> StevenCodes: i don't see a problem with it, unless there're comments in the jsfiddle stating otherwise.
[17:52:19] <beancurd> personally if i make my snippets public, i wouldn't mind if someone stumbled upon them and used them for their own benefit.
[17:53:20] <billygalbreath> people are still worried about others "stealing" their code on the web? I thought this was an old battle that ended in the late 90s..
[17:53:42] <StevenCodes> beancurd, yeah I know just i dont wanna take it if its copyrighter or someshit like that
[17:54:21] <billygalbreath> StevenCodes: everything is copyrighted
[17:54:24] <StevenCodes> billygalbreath,  lol yeah idk just wondering really
[17:54:43] <billygalbreath> what matters is the license attached to it on how you can _use_ it
[17:55:43] <dwbear> is there a way to get the 'id' of the object you mouseover ?
[17:56:09] <dwbear> I'd like to do something like the.mouseover(function())..
[17:56:19] <dwbear> or this.mouseover(function())
[17:56:32] <billygalbreath> dwbear: depends on your setup, really. there are lots of ways. give us a jsfiddle of what you got and i'll show you
[17:57:11] <dwbear> billygalbreath: okay - I'm new to jquery and don't know what a jsfiddle is.. sorry.
[17:57:18] <billygalbreath> jsfiddle.net
[17:57:56] <dwbear> billygalbreath: cool -- will try to understand how to use it.
[17:58:21] <billygalbreath> dwbear: here's an example of something I did last night on it: http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/22/
[17:59:31] <billygalbreath> StevenCodes: so what chunk of code are you worried about?
[18:00:41] <StevenCodes> billygalbreath,  simple example http://jsfiddle.net/KbCDs/5/ and i made http://jsfiddle.net/KbCDs/13/
[18:02:11] <billygalbreath> yeah - no worries. you wont be sued over something like that
[18:02:17] <billygalbreath> lol
[18:02:50] <hacks> How can I build up an array of elements and then append all of them into a jQuery object?
[18:03:20] <StevenCodes> lo
[18:03:21] <hacks> $myListElement.append([$li1, $li2, ...]); chokes
[18:03:21] <StevenCodes> lol
[18:03:44] <hacks> Of course I'm "building" this array, so it's not a array literal like that
[18:04:16] <hacks> It's more like $myListElement.append(listItems); Where listItems is an array of elements.
[18:04:57] <billygalbreath> hacks: sounds like a foreach loop is what you need
[18:05:23] <Whirl3d> hacks, just concat your array into one long string and append it
[18:05:27] <hacks> billygalbreath: meh, I'll just create a $newList = $('<ul>'); then append to that.
[18:05:43] <hacks> Whirl3d: the elements are actual jquery objects, not strings
[18:05:50] <ML74> Could some one help me with the image scroller here: http://designbyml.com/photogems/ ? It works fine when I first load the page, but if I refresh it stops working.
[18:06:20] <Whirl3d> .map is what you want, I think
[18:06:43] <coldhead> don't you know the president is super super sexy
[18:07:30] <Whirl3d> var str=$.map(arr, function (elem, i) {return (elem.html());}).get().join(""); $(ul).append(str);
[18:07:33] <billygalbreath> coldhead: i can see that.. if you like skinny old liars. definitely.
[18:07:59] <Whirl3d> that's inappropriate and inflamatory. Take it to #pettybiggots
[18:08:24] <billygalbreath> :)
[18:08:28] <coldhead> wait i meant clinton
[18:09:21] <coldhead> the most important thing is for presidents to be good dancers
[18:10:16] <Cyber-Dogg> I'm looking for a plugin or an example of having a "show more" function on a text box
[18:10:29] <Cyber-Dogg> well - not text box... but div with text in it
[18:10:47] <Cyber-Dogg> so, I was like 3 lines of text to display initially, then have a "show more" link that causes it to expand
[18:11:13] <Cyber-Dogg> doing a toggle on the height in an animate would be perfect except I don't want it to take height to 0
[18:11:18] <Cyber-Dogg> just like 60px;
[18:11:31] <Cyber-Dogg> although, I want it to start "collapsed" as well
[18:12:12] <billygalbreath> Cyber-Dogg: thats a little simplistic, imho, to be a full plugin. have you even tried to roll your own?
[18:13:01] <Cyber-Dogg> billygalbreath: I agree (but there are a lot a very simple plugins out there, imho, and I use them :-))
[18:13:09] <Cyber-Dogg> I wouldn't mind rolling my own
[18:13:13] <Cyber-Dogg> just need a little guidance
[18:13:27] <Cyber-Dogg> so, I can get it to "start" the way I want
[18:13:33] <dwbear> clearly, I don't know what I'm doing becuase http://jsfiddle.net/MCtTL/ doesn't behave the way I want.
[18:13:44] <Cyber-Dogg> height: 60px; overflow: hidden;
[18:14:03] <Cyber-Dogg> how do I calculate the height needed ot fully expose the text that is hidden?
[18:14:04] <dwbear> I just want when a mouseover happens to 'unhide' 'this->div'
[18:14:14] <coldhead> dwbear: you can't hover over something that isn't visible
[18:14:20] <coldhead> there's no where to hover!
[18:14:47] <dwbear> coldhead 'this' is visibile but the child div of this is hidden
[18:15:03] <dwbear> wait..
[18:15:06] <dwbear> I see my error
[18:15:08] <dwbear> arg..
[18:15:12] <Cyber-Dogg> the css is display: none
[18:15:21] <Cyber-Dogg> so it wouldn't be available for mouse over either right?
[18:15:24] <ML74> Could some one help me with the image scroller here: http://designbyml.com/photogems/ ? It works fine when I first load the page, but if I refresh it stops working.
[18:16:09] <Cyber-Dogg> billygalbreath: any help or suggestions on how to do that calculation?
[18:18:47] <billygalbreath> dwbear: http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/MCtTL/6/
[18:20:05] <dwbear> billygalbreath: yes... approaching what I what.
[18:20:08] <dwbear> thank you
[18:20:09] <billygalbreath> Cyber-Dogg: you dont need to know the height. If its a standard block DIV it should expand once you remove a restrictive height and overflow by clicking on a "show more" button.
[18:20:48] <Whirl3d> Cyber-Dogg, have you tried any of the hundred of readmore plugins for insight?
[18:20:49] <Cyber-Dogg> billygalbreath: true - but I was hoping to have it ease
[18:21:35] <billygalbreath> Cyber-Dogg: use two css classes. one restrict height and overflow hidden. the other unrestrictive. use a css transition animation and toggle between the two classes using jquery.
[18:22:07] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath, gotta love css transition animations, huh?
[18:22:40] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  Got any kewl examples ?
[18:22:42] <billygalbreath> Cyber-Dogg: look at this i made last night http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/22/ <- it uses transition animation with css and toggles two classes with jquery. its colors though, you'd have to use heights and overflows.
[18:22:47] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: hells yeah
[18:22:54] <billygalbreath> thanks again for showing me that last night :D
[18:23:16] <dwbear> billygalbreath: I think I have what I want http://jsfiddle.net/MCtTL/9/
[18:23:22] <dwbear> many thanks.
[18:23:39] <billygalbreath> np, dwbear
[18:23:54] <hacks> $ele.data('value') is completely different from $ele.val() or $ele.attr('value'), correct?
[18:24:19] <billygalbreath> .data() is meta-data, i think.
[18:24:20] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, if there's any question about the occasional improvement in speed: http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/demos/speed.php
[18:25:30] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: too bad CSS cant change content
[18:25:43] <billygalbreath> you should see one of my projects cpu usage lol
[18:27:17] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  I'm likin it alot
[18:28:20] <Whirl3d> I was planning to use transit.js until Cork noted that the demo doesn't use the plugin...which kinda made me uneasy.
[18:28:36] <ML74> Could some one help me with the image scroller here: http://designbyml.com/photogems/ ? It works fine when I first load the page, but if I refresh it stops working.
[18:29:08] <brokenflipside> hey I have a weird problem, my CSS breaks on my jquery powered slider when you load with ctrl + shift + r in FF.... any ideas?  it only happens in FF, from what I can tell.
[18:29:50] <ML74> brokenflipside: Kinda the same problem here!
[18:29:56] <brokenflipside> i see that
[18:30:02] <brokenflipside> i am trying to load your link
[18:30:27] <brokenflipside> it sends me to a 404
[18:31:28] <ML74> a 404? you sure? working for me when i click it
[18:31:28] <billygalbreath> brokenflipside: ctrl+shift+r reloads the page, overriding the cache
[18:31:56] <ML74> billygalbreath: Mine's breaking on just cmd+R
[18:32:41] <Whirl3d> without the un-minified source for your Cross-slide, it's not easy to troubleshoot
[18:32:47] <billygalbreath> ML74: each browser has their own shortcut for reloading without cache
[18:32:53] <brokenflipside> it clears the cache and reloads, Shouldn't it work on reload?  Wouldn't this happen to anyone who visits the page for the first time.
[18:33:13] <billygalbreath> brokenflipside: how are you loading the css file?
[18:33:44] <brokenflipside> it is linked at the top of the index.php or html depending on if its live or local
[18:33:56] <brokenflipside> either way same result upon cleared cache reload
[18:33:59] <brokenflipside> only in FF
[18:34:19] <billygalbreath> try putting it in the header (not an external file) just to test
[18:34:31] <brokenflipside> ok
[18:34:31] <billygalbreath> <style></style> instead of <link />
[18:34:55] <Whirl3d> brokenflipside, ML74, if you are loading images and the slider plugin relies on the load.complete method to trigger the slider execution, you could run into problems as well with cached/non-cached images
[18:35:16] <ML74> Whirl3d: What's the best solution? :/
[18:35:35] <Whirl3d> well, first of all. Start with unminified plugin code
[18:35:46] <Whirl3d> then, when all the bugs are worked out, switch to minified
[18:35:58] <Whirl3d> otherwise you are just going to be chasing your tail
[18:37:06] <Whirl3d> Also, if possible use a CDN for jquery. I prefer Google's cdn. It's easy to get the latest version
[18:38:44] <brokenflipside> Well it doesnt do anything for me to put the styles in the head and as I wrote this plugin myself it isn't minified.  http://star-power.mapstone.biz/leather-home-cinema-seating  don't judge its just the leather and chair slider I did EVERYTHING else on this site is NOT mine.
[18:39:47] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure why, ML74, but I see dozens of scripts loading: event_bindings, apitest, i18n, sendRequest....that don't show up on my other tabs, do those things sound familiar to you?
[18:40:09] <Whirl3d> might be me, but it's weird
[18:40:29] <ML74> Whirl3d: Nope :/
[18:40:51] <brokenflipside> http://star-power.mapstone.biz/templates/jxtc_espresso/js/jq-LWI-slider.js here is my source for my slider
[18:40:57] <ML74> Whirl3d: There's only 3 scripts set to load in the header :/
[18:42:38] <Whirl3d> it's word perfect
[18:42:42] <Whirl3d> wordpress
[18:42:45] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:43:42] <brokenflipside> ?
[18:44:21] <brokenflipside> i dont know why but I cannot load ml74 site.
[18:44:34] <ML74> brokenflipside: where are you based?
[18:44:40] <brokenflipside> US
[18:44:48] <ML74> Whirl3d: huh?
[18:44:58] <ML74> hmmmm… you just get a 404 error?
[18:45:02] <billygalbreath> brokenflipside: i cant recreate your issue. but i'm not using a "real" firefox. I have Iceweasel.
[18:45:18] <Whirl3d> iceweasel?
[18:45:26] <systemfault> Firefox for freetards.
[18:45:30] <brokenflipside> hmmmm anyone else with FF willing to try?
[18:45:38] <billygalbreath> it's Debian's version of firefox, with lots of bug fixes mozilla is too slow to do.
[18:46:53] <billygalbreath> I dont use it, I'm a Chrome fanboy thru and thru. Its just installed by default on here, and I use it to test my pages against FF
[18:46:54] <Whirl3d> brokenflipside, it appears that your plugin looks for instances of itself up to 3 times and then just fails?
[18:49:17] <Whirl3d> so, brokenflipside, this is not so much a jquery extension or plugin as just a javascript script that produces a SLIDER object
[18:49:29] <brokenflipside> true
[18:49:38] <brokenflipside> it relies on jquery though
[18:49:52] <Whirl3d> and where is this being implemented?
[18:50:18] <brokenflipside> how do you mean, where is live?
[18:50:27] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/p8Yuw/22/
[18:50:40] <Whirl3d> I think you may have to put all of your SLIDER methods inside doc ready. Perhaps it's failing because it can't access jquery on reload
[18:51:17] <brokenflipside> oh on the actual page as opposed to a link doc?
[18:51:41] <billygalbreath> doc ready is a method
[18:51:56] <billygalbreath> it fires when the page is fully loaded
[18:52:11] <billygalbreath> to prevent things from firing before they are actually loaded on the page
[18:52:12] <Whirl3d> If your script loads before jquery, all of it's methods will fail if it depends on jquery
[18:52:18] <brokenflipside> oops duh... let me do that
[18:52:23] <ML74> Whirl3d: So where's mine messing up? I can't find anything :/
[18:52:48] <Whirl3d> I'm gonna say that it might have something to do with your wordpress theme. I'm still looking
[18:54:31] <Whirl3d> if you click on the "view galleries" link on the home page, you get a whole lot of errors
[18:55:21] <ML74> Whirl3d: Fixed! 	jQuery(window).load(function() {
[18:55:22] <brokenflipside> Well I moved the doc.ready from the slider.js file to the head of the index.html on my local machine and it results in the same bug...
[18:55:40] <ML74> Whirled: Oh, I know. I've only done work on the homepage really.
[18:55:59] <Whirl3d> Here is what I am saying brokenflipside, try putting all of your code for the SLIDER inside a closure.
[18:56:20] <brokenflipside> oh ok
[18:56:29] <billygalbreath> be safe. wrap it before you tap it.
[18:56:34] <brokenflipside> haha
[18:56:55] <Whirl3d> This ensures that jquery is loaded before your plugin is iniitailized
[18:57:54] <scram> hello, question: I have a jquery  slider (filament plugin). How can I get my url to change to something like u.com/?rich=4&sweet=1 if I have an HTML select . I think something is wrong with my get statement because I use get for the url and the form. http://www.resumeicons.com/test1/index.php
[18:58:05] <Whirl3d> That's going to be my first guess. If that doesn't work, I'll need a link to the source page. But I may have to step away
[18:58:52] <scram> I want the url to change when I move the slider alone, i should say
[18:59:35] <Whirl3d> ?.bbq@scram
[18:59:36] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".bbq" in jQuery Docs.
[18:59:42] <thomedy> i am doing something right now in jquery and i cant figure out what my error is..
[19:00:07] <thomedy> i dont know what to google. or correct im confused entirely and have no idea where to go where to correct this
[19:00:17] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[19:00:39] <Whirl3d> scram, your best bet is going to be to use hashchange. Lookup jquery bbq or jquery hashchange.
[19:01:19] <Whirl3d> thomedy, there's no content there
[19:01:20] <thomedy> i have created a slide show that runs perfectly except ever click increments
[19:01:28] <scram> ok, yummly.com uses hashes, that's what Im aiming for, let me look
[19:01:44] <thomedy> http://www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[19:02:03] <thomedy> thats copied off my url so that should work
[19:02:23] <Whirl3d> weird, it opened a blank page for some reason. I got it now.
[19:02:37] <billygalbreath> its slow to load. images took about 5 seconds each for me
[19:02:38] <thomedy> okay if 0you clic
[19:02:44] <thomedy> 3333333333333333333333.
[19:02:45] <thomedy> 24888888.936+
[19:02:59] <billygalbreath> thomedy must have a cat or kids
[19:03:13] <thomedy> kids]
[19:03:15] <billygalbreath> lol
[19:03:22] <thomedy> 'sorrry
[19:03:56] <Whirl3d> wow. Very perceptive billygalbreath, I wouldn't thought epilepsy or parkinsons...lol
[19:04:04] <Whirl3d> just kidding
[19:04:15] <billygalbreath> that was my next thought
[19:04:17] <Whirl3d> but I wouldn't have thought kids or cats, thats for sure. LOL
[19:04:25] <billygalbreath> stroke
[19:04:49] <billygalbreath> i only know cause i have a cat and kids
[19:04:50] <Whirl3d> if it was coldhead, I'd swear it was that he got his bucket bong loaded
[19:04:53] <billygalbreath> both do that to me sometimes
[19:05:26] <thomedy> omy 8 month old is requiring alot of attention right now sorry guys
[19:05:37] <thomedy> hes eating my ear
[19:05:43] <billygalbreath> nom nom nom
[19:06:02] <thomedy> okay... yes there is quite time im hoping i can reduce that
[19:06:38] <thomedy> i am not entirely sure how right now
[19:06:45] <thomedy> but i need to
[19:07:54] <thomedy> click on an image 2 or 3 and then click on the far left image it will create small thumbs at the bottom which include a slide show
[19:07:56] <dogarrhea2> hrm. i have left in some debugs on my application. some times alert boxes show up with the word "shit" on it.. time to grep all alerts out of my files..
[19:09:48] <bregoldae> can anyone tell me why this wouldnt output something:: http://jsfiddle.net/MVm7y/
[19:10:47] <billygalbreath> bregoldae: i get a 404 in console, but not from console.debug()
[19:10:53] <Whirl3d> thomedy, got it. Sort of. What is it supposed to do?
[19:12:17] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: my guess is i see the same picture in all of them, so its most likely an array issue
[19:12:28] <bregoldae> billygalbreath im just running that script locally, do I need to have it in a local webserver since its a json thing
[19:12:29] <bregoldae> ?
[19:15:08] <billygalbreath> bregoldae: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/jquery-json-error-catching/
[19:15:38] <thomedy> alright hes asleep for now
[19:15:53] <thomedy> sorry about the numbers my son is like the rain man
[19:16:01] <thomedy> and he communicates through numbers
[19:16:13] <thomedy> that was a message of love, i have learned to understand im his father
[19:16:28] <billygalbreath> nice cover
[19:18:31] <billygalbreath> thomedy: its difficult to help debug your page. that middle picture is rather distracting for me :p
[19:18:46] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: you wanna mess with something more fun that blinking divs?
[19:22:01] <thomedy> yeah i didn't mean to but common'
[19:22:16] <thomedy> but its a fashion site in the end im trying to focus on the goal at hand
[19:22:27] <thomedy> okay what i did was add some more dummy content
[19:22:31] <thomedy> to the middle image
[19:22:54] <thomedy> so click onthe left image and try the slide show that appears under the main image
[19:23:01] <thomedy> and then click the middle image again
[19:23:12] <thomedy> now it slides 2x
[19:23:20] <thomedy> then click the left and it slides 3x
[19:23:25] <thomedy> i have no idea why
[19:24:30] <billygalbreath> i dont think i'm seeing it the way you're wanting. the slides are going vertical for me in Chrome v20 on Debian
[19:24:51] <billygalbreath> so the left/right arrows are making the slide disappear out of the containing box
[19:24:54] <thomedy> crap i have to admit... im still a bit new at this i have to check
[19:24:57] <thomedy> my css
[19:27:02] <thomedy> i saw that on my phone okay let me do this... it all has to be fixed any way so before i get my jquery
[19:29:07] <Horizons>  [ $.each(ddi['this.val()'], function (iselect) { ] - I'm trying to get the value of the selectbox this .change code is triggered by and use it to look up a value in a multi array by its key and yes ddi is an array. this.val is the option selected form the dropdown.
[19:29:15] <thomedy> going to w3validator should fix all that right
[19:29:49] <Horizons> err... tring to get value from arrray by key lookup using this.val
[19:29:53] <Horizons> trying*
[19:30:36] <poot> whats the best way to define a function outside of jquery(document).ready() that uses jquery?
[19:30:40] <billygalbreath> thomedy: not always, but its a start
[19:30:52] <thomedy> this is my 2nd site
[19:31:16] <thomedy> im pretty psyched im teaching  myself php, jquery, all the web stuff but i have c++ from college to get me going
[19:31:21] <thomedy> so im already oop
[19:34:11] <coldhead> thomedy: do you need anyone to talk you out of php?
[19:34:54] <thomedy> well what got me started last year was drupal so i have to learn php but i hear some chatter that its not as good as others
[19:35:03] <thomedy> basically drupal is teaching php
[19:35:07] <coldhead> thomedy: http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
[19:35:27] <coldhead> it has a nice low barrier to entry but you'll grow to hate it
[19:35:50] <thomedy> more or les but they dont really like me sometimes becaust i insist on learning  actuall php and not just api
[19:37:22] <billygalbreath> i honestly dont have a problem with php and love it to death
[19:38:39] <billygalbreath> anyone i've ever seen that knocks php is an elitist hipster just knocking you because you use something they feel is inferior. every crowd has these people though, not just php. i've learned to ignore them and go on my merry way.
[19:38:46] <Christophe_v_e> Hi, I was wondering if it's possible to make an if statement based on the parent's ID/Class, something along the lines of if( *a preceeding div's class/id* == something ){} - the * a preceeding div's class/id * is where I'd want jQuery to come in..
[19:39:14] <coldhead> thomedy: if you like javascript you might like to mess around with node.js, then you can use javascript everywhere
[19:39:48] <coldhead> billygalbreath: did you just say that ANYONE who knocks php is a hipster?
[19:39:57] <billygalbreath> i didnt say that
[19:40:01] <coldhead> oh good
[19:40:03] <coldhead> just checking
[19:40:13] <billygalbreath> i said the people i've seen - this is far from everyone
[19:42:34] <billygalbreath> i'm not saying that php is the holy grail either. its far from perfect. but it has its place in the world, and people should be talking others out of using it just because its php. thats my point.
[19:42:50] <billygalbreath> every language serves its purpose as has a place.
[19:43:12] <coldhead> i would like to talk people out of it so i don't have to help them with it later
[19:43:26] <coldhead> and so i can do consulting jobs and not have to fix someone else's php
[19:43:45] <Whirl3d> except for icelandic. I saw this guy with learn conversational icelandik in an hour.
[19:44:05] <Whirl3d> it's supposedly the hardest language to learn/speak/read ever
[19:44:33] <TuckerWhitehouse> Hey, i've got a quick question about how jQuery mimics an array in the console, and was curious if anyone could explain to me why it seems a length object and splice object are all that are required to mimic an array in javascript? I made a quick example of the code i'm talking about at http://jsfiddle.net/WbkMq/.
[19:45:49] <Whirl3d> huh?
[19:46:11] <hobs> coldhead is a man who is hard as ice and his heart reflects that, so dont be upset if he calls what you are doing poop
[19:46:16] <hobs> he means it in the nicest way possible
[19:46:22] <hobs> (its still poop though)
[19:47:06] <hobs> I like going to that I h8 php page and reading until I get tired, and I rarely get to past half the page
[19:47:21] <digitalrain> Hello all
[19:47:47] <coldhead> its a sure cure for insomnia
[19:47:55] <optraz> i select a attribute title from an input type = text like so, $('#id').attr('title') but how do i show this value on top of the input field?
[19:48:30] <digitalrain> can someone point me to an example of tabbed horizontal navigation that works within the jquery themeroller framework? Not tabbed content, but main horizontal navigation
[19:49:08] <Whirl3d> jquery ui?
[19:50:19] <digitalrain> no, it doesn't have what I'm looking for. It has the tabbed content areas. That's not what I mean
[19:51:11] <digitalrain> like the navigation here http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/ but themeroller compatible
[19:53:19] <dschuett> I know how to use maxDate and minDate with datepicker. Does anyone know how to only count business days? e.g. maxDate: 2 business days
[19:57:26] <bregoldae> can anyone tell me why firebug tells me: syntax error [ in reference to the start of my json file?
[19:57:34] <coldhead> dschuett: i assume you've seen this $(".selector").datepicker({ beforeShowDay: $.datepicker.noWeekends })
[19:57:39] <Whirl3d> digitalrain, you just want a glorified dropdown menu (with a big ole dropdown)
[19:57:44] <coldhead> i'd poke around in the code for something related
[19:58:00] <coldhead> bregoldae: does the code validate with jsonlint?
[19:58:05] <coldhead> http://www.jsonlint.com/
[19:58:29] <digitalrain> Whirl3d - but it has to be themeroller ready
[19:59:12] <bregoldae> coldhead, yes it validates
[19:59:24] <billygalbreath> digitalrain: http://www.codingwhiz.com/jqueryui/jquery-ui-themeroller-enabled-dropdown-menu.html
[19:59:41] <coldhead> weird, bregoldae
[19:59:45] <coldhead> how are you loading it?
[19:59:51] <bregoldae> and this is how i load it: http://jsfiddle.net/E8F6x/
[20:00:05] <abjorn> :o
[20:00:51] <coldhead> i don't suppose you have a live demo, bregoldae?
[20:01:24] <bregoldae> I dont :\ The code seems to work, firebugs console just outputs that syntax error :\
[20:01:42] <coldhead> i've never seen that
[20:01:55] <coldhead> does chrome throw a similar error?
[20:02:13] <billygalbreath> i get 404 in chrome with his fiddle
[20:02:22] <billygalbreath> not syntax err
[20:02:32] <coldhead> because the json is not hosted
[20:02:49] <billygalbreath> i know that - just saying its not detecting a syntax error
[20:02:59] <coldhead> the error appears to be in the json
[20:03:04] <coldhead> somehow
[20:03:23] <bregoldae> checking in chrome
[20:04:11] <coldhead> the json shouldn't even be evaluated
[20:04:19] <coldhead> so lawd knows why it's gomblaining
[20:04:29] <bregoldae> chrome is giving me a: XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/engineer-training/driving-quiz/resources/js/addresses/pv.json. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[20:05:06] <coldhead> oh bregoldae, AJAX doesn't work with file:///
[20:05:12] <coldhead> For Your Safety
[20:05:17] <coldhead> you need to localhost that shit, at least
[20:05:23] <bregoldae> ah see <— new guy, localhosting it now
[20:05:28] <Forbidd3n> Why is it firebug doesn't show every ajax call?
[20:05:37] <abjorn> Oh lawd, tomorrow is 420. Pretty sure 90% of the other devs at my work are gonna be away from work for most of tomorrow on "car rides" or "at the park"
[20:05:50] <abjorn> I ALONE WILL BE PRODUCTIVE
[20:05:54] <coldhead> Forbidd3n: you right clicked and Show(ed) XHR requests?
[20:06:17] <Forbidd3n> If I put an alert in the change function it alerts, but doesn't show the ajax call
[20:06:21] <Forbidd3n> right click where?
[20:06:35] <coldhead> in the console
[20:06:38] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: it does it on some pages, just not all of them
[20:06:44] <Forbidd3n> and I know the ajax call is sent
[20:06:47] <coldhead> gross
[20:06:53] <coldhead> are some of them jsonp?
[20:07:23] <Forbidd3n> yeah
[20:07:30] <coldhead> jsonp is not really ajax
[20:07:35] <coldhead> they'll show in the script tab
[20:07:35] <Forbidd3n> the ones that aren't working aer json
[20:07:37] <Forbidd3n> area
[20:07:41] <Forbidd3n> are ugh can't type
[20:07:48] <bregoldae> coldhead, thanks for opening my eyes lol, localhosting it obviously worked
[20:07:53] <Forbidd3n> they were showing up, and it just stopped showing
[20:07:55] <coldhead> good work bregoldae!
[20:07:58] <Forbidd3n> but the call does get made
[20:08:12] <coldhead> i'm out of ideas, Forbidd3n, move to chrome? :P
[20:08:44] <Forbidd3n> does firebug work on chrome
[20:08:54] <coldhead> no, chrome has a built in Web Inspector
[20:08:57] <coldhead> that is very similar
[20:09:03] <coldhead> except maybe it won't fuck up on you
[20:09:13] <Forbidd3n> ok thanks I have chrome installed already
[20:09:55] <billygalbreath> ctrl+shift+j in chrome ;)
[20:11:06] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: where would I see the call in chrome?
[20:11:43] <bregoldae> thanks again coldhead
[20:12:16] <coldhead> Forbidd3n: if you right click on the console you can enable Show XHR (or words to that effect)
[20:12:22] <coldhead> and you'll also see the Scripts tab
[20:12:35] <coldhead> wherein all things are shown
[20:12:53] <coldhead> bot-t: tell bregoldae i will never forget you
[20:12:53] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[20:14:47] <billygalbreath> i like how chrome lets you right click an element on the page and chose "inspect element" and it instantly goes to that line in the code. very helpful when you have a page full of dynamically created content
[20:16:42] <Bankzilla> firefox is better for pin pointed content
[20:16:59] <Bankzilla> chrome never seems to get the exact line you're needing
[20:20:18] <dschuett> coldhead: i have seen the noweekends, but when doing maxDate it still counts the weekends
[20:22:48] <dschuett> coldhead: as you can see here: http://jsfiddle.net/nsP3L/
[20:23:48] <coldhead> sorry, dschuett, i haven't used datepicker in many years
[20:23:57] <coldhead> i only found that noweekends thing with a google
[20:24:33] <coldhead> i imagine you will have to write a custom day counter that does modular arithmetic
[20:24:46] <coldhead> i'm sure there'll be one already written somewhere
[20:25:20] <dschuett> coldhead: yeah, that is actually what i've just started. i just wanted to make sure there wasn't an easier way. Thanks for you help!
[20:25:50] <coldhead> good luck babe
[20:35:47] <billygalbreath> my stupid cat just figured out how to open my pantry door. i learned of this new feat from the sound of the catfood slamming against the floor and spreading _everywhere_ it possibly could. great..
[20:36:21] <coldhead> inconvenience aside, marvelous ingenuity
[20:36:33] <billygalbreath> indeed
[20:41:58] <billygalbreath> coldhead: you seem to know a thing or two about coding. mind looking over something for me and possibly giving me some pointers on how to improve it?
[20:46:04] <beancurd> eat it.
[20:46:07] <beancurd> eat it all.
[20:47:27] <coldhead> i don't know much billygalbreath
[20:47:30] <coldhead> but i can look!
[20:47:33] <billygalbreath> k
[20:47:34] <billygalbreath> http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/RV6KA/2/
[20:47:47] <billygalbreath> this eats about 25% of one of my cpu cores.
[20:47:56] <billygalbreath> maybe you know a way to make it more efficient?
[20:48:01] <coldhead> neat!
[20:48:23] <Bankzilla> you're building a matrix?
[20:48:29] <coldhead> yeah sure thing, billygalbreath
[20:48:37] <coldhead> the first thing i'd do is not bother giving the elements IDs
[20:48:54] <coldhead> i'd just save the actual object returned when you create them
[20:49:07] <neohunter> i have a input[type=file], i want to use a image to activate it so i have $('#myInput').click(). it works on firefox but not on chrome, any ideas?
[20:49:18] <coldhead> like um $entry = $('<p>etc</p>')
[20:49:34] <coldhead> and then i'd store each $entry in an array that mirrors the stuff you have on the page
[20:49:41] <coldhead> then you can iterate through the saved $entries
[20:49:44] <coldhead> and do waht you need
[20:49:52] <billygalbreath> you think that would be faster?
[20:49:54] <coldhead> rather than looking them up by ID again and again
[20:49:57] <coldhead> and recreating them
[20:49:59] <coldhead> totally faster!
[20:50:05] <billygalbreath> hmm. interesting
[20:50:12] <coldhead> one instantiation per element
[20:50:14] <coldhead> reused for life
[20:50:24] <coldhead> rather than making a new one every manipulation
[20:50:30] <coldhead> that's more memory expensive
[20:50:31] <coldhead> but
[20:50:37] <coldhead> not ridiculously
[20:51:08] <billygalbreath> well, its not recreating them (or so i think) but changing the html inside each run
[20:51:11] <coldhead> that's the most obvious optimisation i can see
[20:51:26] <coldhead> yeah but $('#foo') has to create a new jQuery object
[20:51:35] <coldhead> and look up #foo each time
[20:51:41] <billygalbreath> ah - i see now
[20:51:50] <coldhead> compared with already having it at the ready for reuse
[20:52:27] <billygalbreath> ok cool. i'll make that change and see how it compares. thanks :D
[20:52:39] <coldhead> cool
[20:52:42] <coldhead> sure looks fine
[20:53:16] <coldhead> if that's still slow i would maybe put both 0s and 1s in each element
[20:53:26] <coldhead> and use css to change the bit that's shown
[20:53:39] <coldhead> that should be less CPU intensive than manipulating the dom
[20:53:48] <coldhead> just toggleClass
[20:55:26] <billygalbreath> will toggleClass allow me to use multiple classes?
[20:55:38] <billygalbreath> like, i eventually want to add a fading highlight to each element when it changes
[20:55:43] <coldhead> yes, .toggleClass('foo bar baz')
[20:55:49] <billygalbreath> cool
[20:55:53] <coldhead> will do whatever it needs to do to toggle those guys
[20:56:07] <coldhead> oh you know what
[20:56:14] <coldhead> you could just do it simply with 2 classes
[20:56:22] <coldhead> and use CSS transitions for the fade
[20:56:37] <coldhead> that would be the neatest way and fuck you IE
[20:56:42] <billygalbreath> hehe
[20:56:54] <coldhead> and on that bombshell, time for lunch
[20:56:57] <coldhead> adieu
[20:57:26] <Horizons> had to say it: Internet Exploiter sux
[21:07:37] <hobs> I disagree
[21:07:52] <hobs> just kidding nobody fucking disagrees with that what are you, a dingus
[21:11:06] <vernondotjpg> How do I make an image have a .click hide function? I can only get it to work with buttons.
[21:13:58] <billygalbreath> coldhead: i'm not seeing any significant improvements. I'm gonna go ahead and try that css part you mentioned.
[21:28:55] <joobie> hey guys.. ive included jquery.js in my html, i want to now call a function in it.. in the body i did onload="myFunction();" and i wrote a sepearte .js and created function myFunction() { .. } .. how can i call jquery from within myFunction now? It looks different how i should be calling it
[21:31:24] <Whirl3d> billygalbreath, what are you trying to do?
[21:31:59] <Zed7> joobie: take a look at this example
[21:31:59] <Zed7> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp
[21:32:51] <Cork> ?g w3fool @ Zed7
[21:32:52] <bot-t> Zed7, W3Fools  A W3Schools Intervention - http://w3fools.com/
[21:34:35] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/BillyGalbreath/RV6KA/4/
[21:34:59] <Whirl3d> I saw that, but what are you trying to accomplish?
[21:35:02] <billygalbreath> coldhead: swapping classes seems to be more cpu intrusive. i'm now ~30%
[21:35:13] <billygalbreath> Whirl3d: make it more efficient
[21:35:22] <Whirl3d> but what is it?
[21:35:36] <billygalbreath> just something i'm doing for fun
[21:35:40] <billygalbreath> pm me and i
[21:35:47] <billygalbreath> 'll link you to the real thing
[21:37:45] <abjorn> (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻)ﾟДﾟ)彡☆
[21:38:50] <Zed7> Yea I agree that w3school needs to wikify their content, some of it is wrong, however the example I linked joobie to is correct ^_^
[21:52:50] <Cork> Zed7: the point is, don't link to w3schools, use one of the modern trust worthy sites
[21:53:45] <Cork> Zed7: if ppl keep linking to it, it will keep beeing on the top of searches and spread miss information
[21:56:01] <BryanRuiz> there is something i dont understand about radio groups
[21:56:29] <BryanRuiz> when i click a radio, the html doesnt change to checked="checked" in chrome
[21:56:41] <BryanRuiz> for some reason i thought this would change
[21:57:17] <Cork> BryanRuiz: no attributes doesn't change
[21:57:28] <Cork> the properties on the element does though
[21:58:15] <BryanRuiz> Cork: i need to somehow make the radio button switch programatically.  i already tried .attr('checked', 'checked') but i see this doesnt work as i expected
[21:58:29] <BryanRuiz> is this stuff i need to do the dom element .checked property?
[21:58:39] <Cork> .prop('checked', true)
[21:58:55] <joobie> Zed7, what im trying to do is when the page loads, PHP will decide if the jquery code is called or not and which element it runs on. The way i was going to do it was have PHP add onload="function()" to <body> if PHP wants the JS function to run.. and then within function () call my jquery.. how could i achieve the similar if i use just jquery?
[21:59:12] <BryanRuiz> Cork: and what about shutting others off, does that happen automatically or do i need to set false
[21:59:36] <Cork> BryanRuiz: yes, as long as they have the same name
[21:59:47] <BryanRuiz> thanks Cork, beer++ for you
[22:02:33] <Zed7> Cork: Point taken :)
[22:06:56] <Zed7> joobie: this is possible with just jquery depending on the condition that your current php code is using to determine if the onload="function()" will be added to the <body> or not
[22:07:51] <joobie> Zed7, how can i target a specific element in the DOM for my JQuery to apply on?
[22:08:01] <joobie> much like document.getElementById("id) ?
[22:08:50] <joobie> I was going to do somethign like this http://pastebin.com/L5vrwpyQ but within that function i want to hide a particular element in the dom.. i only know it's id
[22:10:08] <Dr-Bombay> I might be misunderstanding, do you wnat something different from $('#anId')
[22:11:41] <joobie> trying to do this essentially http://pastebin.com/LCzJLDV3
[22:11:49] <joobie> where login is the id of the element in the dom that i want to hide
[22:12:03] <Zed7> joobie: to target / select a sepecific element in the DOM using jQuery you use $('#elementId')
[22:12:10] <joobie> I get an error back saying $ is not defined when i do http://pastebin.com/LCzJLDV3
[22:12:48] <jcp_> joobie: you need to include jquery before your script
[22:13:00] <joobie> ahh
[22:13:02] <joobie> that might be it
[22:13:02] <joobie> sec
[22:13:42] <Zed7> joobie: yes you will need to include jquery before your script in the header
[22:13:57] <Zed7> you can use this <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:14:23] <Dr-Bombay> aaaaah don't tell people to leech :-O
[22:14:28] <jcp_> lol
[22:14:30] <Zed7> wait, this one <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:14:32] <Zed7> lol :P
[22:16:57] <coldhead> billygalbreath: i am very upset that didn't make it any quicker
[22:17:01] <coldhead> everything i know is wrong
[22:17:10] <billygalbreath> lol
[22:17:12] <coldhead> if i wasn't at work i'd actually profile it and see what's the dealio
[22:17:56] <billygalbreath> you must be in europe?
[22:18:08] <billygalbreath> its just after midnight here in Texas
[22:19:14] <Defrothew> Guys, I got a question. I have dynamic contents and I'm using popover twitter bootstrap to show my content. What is the appropriate code for having dynamic content $("#mypopover" + num) ----- num = my dynamic post id.

[22:23:11] <billygalbreath> its about to be summer, and i'm already missing winter. :'(
[22:23:21] <hyperstream> Defrothew, did you try the example you posted? looks correct
[22:23:51] <hyperstream> billygalbreath, what temps C max you get?
[22:23:55] <Zed7> I want summer back
[22:24:03] <hyperstream> NZ winter is the best
[22:24:09] <hyperstream> Hood up crank that rugged
[22:24:22] <Zed7> its true :P
[22:24:27] <hyperstream> Beanies
[22:24:32] <hyperstream> cher brother
[22:24:37] <Zed7> chur
[22:24:51] <joobie> BTW, is there a way to make sorta a wobble effect? im using $("#login").animate({paddingLeft:"+=15px"},200); which slides the item to the right, then i need to slide to the left and then the right and then the left again.. is the only way to do this just to put multiple lines of this animate function one after another, or is there a smarter way to do it?
[22:24:53] <billygalbreath> hyperstream: idk C, but we hit about 110F every year for 3 months straight.
[22:25:09] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Yeah, my question is I'm using wordpress and then I have different contents displayed at once and uses popover to show my content. I want to have like popover-11231, popover-1231. My problem is how to return my wordpress IDs. :)
[22:25:10] <hyperstream> Someone please do the conversion ^_^
[22:25:28] <billygalbreath> 43.33333C
[22:25:34] <Zed7> wow!
[22:25:37] <Zed7> that's hot
[22:25:38] <hyperstream> Defrothew, out of my league never really messed with word press
[22:25:54] <hyperstream> billygalbreath, damn frig that, i hate them spot 38's we get here
[22:25:58] <Zed7> joobie: there is a better way to do that, 1 sec ill try find it
[22:25:59] <billygalbreath> we're also right by a gulf, so humidity is always 80% +
[22:26:12] <hyperstream> billygalbreath, sounds like Australia on steroids over there
[22:26:14] <billygalbreath> we get the best of both worlds
[22:26:16] <billygalbreath> i hate it
[22:26:17] <billygalbreath> lol
[22:26:29] <thomedy> okay after falling asleep, waking up 2 a son who woke up yada yada yada i was able to look into it i found out that if i over load the width on css in chrome it basically denies me so i dont know about full cross brower compatability but i should have fixed the horizontal thing
[22:26:32] <Defrothew> @hyperstream I see. Thanks for your concern. :)
[22:26:33] <hyperstream> billygalbreath, but then again thats what the beaches are for ^_^
[22:26:45] <billygalbreath> not ours :/
[22:26:58] <hyperstream> ??
[22:27:02] <billygalbreath> if you're bored enough look up Galveston, Texas, USA
[22:27:12] <billygalbreath> you'll see what I mean. nastiest waters ever.
[22:27:22] <joobie> thanks Zed7
[22:27:38] * hyperstream looks
[22:27:41] <billygalbreath> not only from being dirty, but you'll catch diseases too like hepatitis B/C
[22:28:02] <hyperstream> wtf, why is that?
[22:28:06] <billygalbreath> idk
[22:28:12] <billygalbreath> i dont think anyone knows
[22:28:19] <hyperstream> heaps of dead bodies i think.
[22:28:23] <hyperstream> to much mafia lol
[22:28:27] <billygalbreath> but its so bad they have to put out flags on days when its too bad for anyone to go out safely
[22:29:08] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[22:29:17] <thomedy> please help me with my slide show..
[22:29:34] <hyperstream> I was reading, the nuclear disaster in japan has spread through oceanic ocean and into north america as well. hitting the foods and live stock ;/
[22:29:40] <Zed7> joobie: would this work http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Shake?
[22:29:44] <Zed7> oops http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Shake
[22:30:05] <Defrothew> @hyperstream What is the solution for having dynamic contents and using ids as unique indicator? I'm using Twitter Bootstrap Popover.
[22:30:15] <hyperstream> Defrothew, O
[22:30:18] <joobie> hmm possibly, it seems to shrink the element width though.. let me try in my code
[22:30:47] <hyperstream> Defrothew, I've never used bootstrap Popover, are you jsut having issues selecting something with a var in the "string"+var ?
[22:30:54] <Zed7> yea I noticed that too
[22:31:03] <hyperstream> Defrothew, have somewhere i can view it in action perhaps ?
[22:31:49] <joobie> Zed7, for some reason that's not working at all..
[22:31:50] <joobie> http://pastebin.com/J0MLGbem
[22:31:57] <joobie> the other example worked using #login
[22:32:23] <joobie> actually it wont work - the #login is position:absolute
[22:32:33] <Zed7> o ok
[22:32:52] <Zed7> and for that I forgot to say that you will need to include the jquery-ui script in the header
[22:33:21] <joobie> is that a different one to jquery-1.7.2.min.js ?
[22:33:46] <Zed7> yes
[22:33:48] <Zed7> 1 sec
[22:33:48] <Defrothew> @hyperstream I got the var working but my problem is it only work for 1 element. My only concern is I name my dynamic contents with popover-IDNUMBER --- where IDNUMBER = a unique ID.
[22:33:49] <Defrothew> $("#mypopover-" + num) ---- My var num = ??? --- I don't know how to unique ids as they are unique.
[22:34:41] <Zed7> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[22:34:45] <Zed7> that one
[22:34:54] <hyperstream> Defrothew, give me a sec just doing up a jsfiddle to clear things up
[22:35:14] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Thanks so much. :)
[22:35:26] <Zed7> It might work on an element that has position absolute, not sure though as I haven't tested it
[22:37:19] <joobie> Zed7, works after that include
[22:37:26] <Zed7> sweet :)
[22:37:37] <joobie> are they just extra custom functions so need to include it?
[22:38:17] <hyperstream> Defrothew, ok so you are trying to say, you need help selecting everything that has popover-* and looping through them and doing stuff?
[22:38:46] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Yep.
[22:38:49] <hyperstream> Defrothew, where IDNUMBER could be anything, and your code has no idea what these IDNUMBER's are.
[22:39:10] <hyperstream> Defrothew, good question, let me investigate that - I'm interested to know also
[22:39:21] <DrBombae> defrothew: numbers. there are always more of em
[22:39:22] <Zed7> yea, jquery ui is like an add-on to the main jquery framework. jquery-ui includes all of the effects and transitions and also pre-made elements like sliders, accordians, tabs etc
[22:39:39] <DrBombae> bah stupid scroll
[22:40:03] <hyperstream> Defrothew, var $eles = $(":input[name^='q1_']").css("font-color","yellow");
[22:40:12] <hyperstream> Defrothew, got from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617480/how-to-get-all-elements-which-name-starts-with-some-string
[22:40:23] <hyperstream> Defrothew, where q1_ would be your popover-
[22:40:33] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Wow, thanks!
[22:40:51] <hyperstream> Defrothew, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/ for docs
[22:40:53] <joobie> ahh
[22:40:54] <joobie> thanks Zed7
[22:41:01] <joobie> i usually write all this crap in JS directly
[22:41:02] <Zed7> your welcome joobie :)
[22:41:06] <joobie> but it seems a heap easier
[22:41:17] <coldhead> that's the idea joobie :)
[22:41:18] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Thanks so much! :D
[22:41:19] <hyperstream> Defrothew, and just for reference on keywords i used with google: jquery select which start with
[22:41:27] <hyperstream> Defrothew, not a problem champ! enjoy :)
[22:41:37] <Zed7> oh wow, yea jquery is definitely easier
[22:41:43] <Defrothew> @hyperstream Ok. :D
[22:41:56] <joobie> i wrote a wobble function in JS with a timer.. works OK but many more lines required :P
[22:42:07] <Zed7> oh I see :P
[22:42:32] <hyperstream> Zed7, been to opo bro?
[22:42:33] <joobie> btw, if i have this http://pastebin.com/vQpFhaF8 and i want to select every <input> below #loginForm excluding the submit one, what selector could do this?
[22:43:20] <Zed7> hyperstream: Opononi ?
[22:43:29] <hyperstream> Zed7, Opotiki
[22:43:35] <hyperstream> Zed7, 30 mins from whakatane
[22:43:42] <Zed7> yep ive been there
[22:43:47] <hyperstream> Home town ^_^
[22:43:59] <Zed7> nice bro ^_^ its nice up there
[22:44:07] <hyperstream> yah drug cap of NZ - atleast it was
[22:44:18] <jcp_> joobie: give them a class like "input" and then do $('.input')… otherwise something like $('input[type=text], input[type=password])
[22:44:26] <jcp_> ehh $('input[type=text], input[type=password]')
[22:44:29] <Zed7> haha sounds about right :P
[22:44:30] <hyperstream> Remember being a kid and being taught how to trim up the buds lol
[22:45:00] <Zed7> haha nice :)
[22:45:23] <hyperstream> I played touch once, got the bash so i joined them and played rugby, year later smashed most of em on the field - awesome place
[22:45:49] <hyperstream> Zed7, pitty John Keys is running it into the ground
[22:45:54] <coldhead> you guys are so new zealish, beauty and violence
[22:46:06] <hyperstream> LOL
[22:46:14] <Zed7> lol oh true, yea touch seems pointless compared to rugby
[22:46:21] <Zed7> coldhead: lol!
[22:46:24] <hyperstream> Staunch kiwi is staunch
[22:46:34] <hyperstream> meat sacks lol
[22:46:47] <Zed7> yea John key isn't do the best job
[22:47:11] <hyperstream> Zed7, he's doing heaps of fracking and crap, all that natural gas. all our rivers gonna get owned like in the states :x
[22:47:29] <hyperstream> Zed7, flameable water - watch Gaslands on youtube - freakkky shit
[22:48:00] <hyperstream> Wont need a gas flame to have spots, just light the tap on, put the knives under and away you go LOL
[22:48:24] <Zed7> hyperstream: yea man, Ive been watching it on the news lately about bringing in fracking and another similar practice, its crap! its going to destroy our land
[22:48:33] <becom33> can I ask mobile jquery questions in this channel ?
[22:49:03] <Zed7> yea bro Ive seen that Gaslands movie, its freaky as! I hope it doesn't get that bad over here
[22:49:04] <hyperstream> Zed7, if you watch gaslands you'll cry, then go take on John ^_^
[22:49:12] <hyperstream> Zed7, nice, yeah it is
[22:49:38] <Zed7> haha mean spots :), yea man that flammable water is insane
[22:49:57] <hyperstream> mean maori mean ahaha
[22:50:06] <Zed7> haha :P
[22:50:18] <hyperstream> kia kaha
[22:50:52] <Zed7> kia kaha :)
[22:51:55] <joobie> thanks jcp_
[22:52:12] <joobie> can i reference #loginForm and within that input[type=text], input[type=password] ?
[22:52:31] <joobie> ie not across the entire dom
[22:52:44] <Zed7> yes you can
[22:53:13] <joobie> how is this done Zed7? $("#loginForm").('input[type=text], input[type=password]') ?
[22:53:26] <jcp_> var form = $('#loginForm'), input = form.find('.input');
[22:53:27] <Zed7> $("#loginForm  input[type=text], #loginForm input[type=password]")
[22:53:49] <jcp_> (assuming you added a class "input" to the fields you want)
[22:53:58] <joobie> i see
[22:53:59] <joobie> interesting
[22:54:18] <joobie> so with the syntax similar to Zed's above
[22:54:38] <joobie> you cant reference a point in the DOM and different types of child elements below?
[22:54:59] <joobie> you have to reference via the full path to each child type or use a method like jcp's?
[22:55:44] <jcp_> you don't need a full path
[22:56:20] <joobie> sorry, the id even
[22:56:33] <joobie> like you can't do a syntax similar to Zed's but only mention #loginForm once?
[22:56:41] <joobie> just curious more than anything..
[22:56:52] <Zed7> I don't think you can
[22:58:24] <joobie> ahh k
[22:58:26] <joobie> thanks :)
[22:59:08] <Zed7> no problem :)
[23:00:55] <Zed7> i guess you could do it like this: $("#loginForm").find("input[type=text], input[type=password]");
[23:01:55] <lijzz> zed7, is there any jquery available for doing sorting and paging together in a ul li list
[23:03:12] <Zed7> lijzz: by paging do you mean pagination?
[23:03:17] <lijzz> yes
[23:03:41] <lijzz> i googled and was able to find one or the other
[23:03:49] <Zed7> There a few good pre-made jquery plugins that do this nicely
[23:04:00] <Zed7> 1sec ill find some
[23:04:05] <lijzz> could you please give me the link
[23:04:11] <lijzz> thanx
[23:04:39] <lijzz> i have a drop down which wil contain the sort conditions, based on that i need to sort on a ul li list
[23:04:48] <lijzz> there should be paging as wel
[23:05:25] <Zed7> oh ok nice :)
[23:05:46] <Zed7> for jquery pagination here are a few: http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-pagination-plugins/
[23:06:24] <Zed7> regarding the drop down sorting, I think you will need to write your own jquery for this
[23:06:47] <Zed7> as I am not sure if there are any pre-made solutions for that
[23:07:34] <lijzz> zed i wil show you what i did till now
[23:07:39] <Zed7> ok sure
[23:10:10] <coldhead> Ka Pīrangi koe ki te kanikani tahi tāua?
[23:12:42] <lijzz> cold head ur head is hot today?
[23:14:09] <coldhead> yes, these headphones are too tight
[23:14:16] <abjorn> lukewarmhead
[23:17:01] <coldhead> i've just listened to an entire album of dance music
[23:17:04] <lijzz> cold head put those in refrigerator
[23:17:05] <coldhead> how do you people live like this
[23:17:27] <lijzz> ilive where
[23:17:46] <lijzz> like wat
[23:18:05] <Zed7> coldhead: I wish I could read maori fluently so I could understand what you said lol
[23:18:10] <lijzz> zed, i am preparing a fiffle for you
[23:18:20] <lijzz> fiddle
[23:18:20] <Zed7> ok cool :)
[23:19:08] <lijzz> zed this is the link http://jsfiddle.net/kD5sF/
[23:19:15] <Zed7> ok
[23:19:35] <lijzz> i have used easyPaginate
[23:20:13] <lijzz> do you want that code
[23:20:50] <Zed7> yes plz
[23:21:13] <lijzz> zed my problem here is , it is sorting, if i select sort by albhabetic order
[23:21:17] <Zed7> is .sSelect some sort of plugin function ?
[23:21:46] <lijzz> .sSelect is the dropdown i used
[23:22:35] <lijzz> zed, that is a select plugin i sed for <select> element
[23:23:01] <Zed7> right ok
[23:23:52] <Zed7> so its sorting but only if you sort by alphabetical order? is that correct?
[23:30:57] <lijzz> zed sorry for delay, my wife called
[23:31:42] <lijzz> zed, this is the easy paginate jquery plugin , i altered littl bit
[23:31:45] <lijzz> http://jsfiddle.net/nbXAL/
[23:32:08] <lijzz> my problem is that it is sorting based on what i select in select
[23:32:32] <lijzz> but when i do paging it is loosing the sorting which i did b4
[23:33:36] <Zed7> no problem :)
[23:33:38] <LukeNukem> anybody here that does realtime stuff?
[23:33:55] <Eviltwin> "realtime stuff"?
[23:33:57] <boogyman> How can I break out of a deferred done object $.when(promise).done(function(){ if(condition) {/* exit deferred */};  I've tried /continue/ and /break/ but they don't seem to work appropriately
[23:33:59] <Eviltwin> Explain further
[23:34:08] <LukeNukem> realtime exchange of data b/w client and server
[23:34:13] <Eviltwin> boogyman: It's a function...
[23:34:21] <Eviltwin> boogyman: How do you break out of functions?
[23:34:37] <LukeNukem> cuz fuck nodejs
[23:34:39] <DrBombae> with a sledgehammer
[23:34:49] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: What's wrong with nodejs?
[23:35:07] <LukeNukem> all the tutorials are outdated
[23:35:12] <LukeNukem> i cant write shit in it
[23:35:19] <Eviltwin> Um... it worked fine for me
[23:35:25] <boogyman> arg, so I guess I need to chain another deferred, because depending on the condition, I may want to exit out of an "outer" loop
[23:35:26] <Eviltwin> I started a project in it two weeks ago
[23:35:33] <Dr-Bombay> nice master's thesis project, bad production platform
[23:35:34] <LukeNukem> i can create a server right
[23:35:42] <Eviltwin> boogyman: Um... deferreds don't really "loop"
[23:35:49] <LukeNukem> i need to do some realtime stuff, i came across nowjs library
[23:36:05] <boogyman> I mean i have a loop encapsulating a deferred
[23:36:09] <LukeNukem> i use their source code, error, error, error! No support from their channel either
[23:36:35] <Eviltwin> I don't see how that's a nodejs problem
[23:36:57] <Dr-Bombay> I'm not eager to start writing all my code in continuation style
[23:37:03] <Dr-Bombay> when I am, maybe I'll look at node
[23:37:09] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, is there any other realtime thingie
[23:38:38] <Dr-Bombay> also not eager to start inserting calls to nextTick everywhere like I'm programming Windows 3.1
[23:39:08] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: If your goal is to have some kind of shared scope between client and server where you only have to write one piece of code and it can run stuff on the both client and server without being a security risk...
[23:39:12] <Eviltwin> You're SOL
[23:39:28] <LukeNukem> SOL>
[23:39:28] <LukeNukem> ?
[23:39:33] <Eviltwin> Shit Out of Luck
[23:39:38] <coldhead> how crude
[23:39:50] <Dr-Bombay> I think Philip Wadler published a paper on a project that did just that
[23:39:59] <Dr-Bombay> hasn't been adopted for production use though
[23:42:02] <Defrothew> I'm still stuck with $("#mypopover-" + num) -- Seems like I can't make it to work with dynamic divs.
[23:42:40] <beancurd> Defrothew: what are you trying to do?
[23:43:12] <Defrothew> @beancurd I'm trying make Twitter Bootstrap Popover to work with dynamic content.
[23:43:54] <Defrothew> @beancurd My idea was to use unique ids foreach of the div contents like for example #mypower-91223
[23:44:19] <astropirate> Defrothew, look at  .on() or .live()
[23:44:30] <Defrothew> @beancurd I see.
[23:44:39] <Eviltwin> No, son't look at .live
[23:44:51] <astropirate> :O
[23:44:56] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[23:44:57] <astropirate> has it lost its grace?
[23:44:58] <Defrothew> So will be looking at on(); instead?
[23:45:00] <astropirate> ohh
[23:45:02] <Eviltwin> And will be removed in a future release
[23:45:09] <astropirate> sorry didn't know :)
[23:45:13] <boogyman> astropirate: use 'delegate'
[23:45:19] <Eviltwin> The syntax is and always has been misleading
[23:45:26] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate if you have a version <1.7
[23:45:36] <Defrothew> I see so instead of live(), I will be using delegate()?
[23:45:37] <Eviltwin> If you have a version >=1.7, there's no reason not to use .on
[23:45:41] <thomedy> okay one final try before i have to go to bed for work in the morning
[23:45:44] <Eviltwin> In fact .delegate will call .on in 1.7+
[23:45:56] <thomedy> if someone wouldn't mind going to www.thesartorer.com/?q=admin
[23:46:00] <thomedy> dont do that
[23:46:01] <thomedy> sorry
[23:46:12] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com/?q=menswear
[23:46:14] <beancurd> delegate has been suprceded by on in >1.7
[23:46:19] <thomedy> that other one was habit
[23:46:20] <astropirate> thomedy, just got hacked by 20 people
[23:46:24] <thomedy> ha ha
[23:46:43] <thomedy> the jokes on you by going to that site you  just downloaded 20 viruses
[23:46:48] <thomedy> okay on the real now
[23:46:55] <astropirate> thomedy, sorry i'm not on a mac :p
[23:47:04] <thomedy> im working on a slide show on my for sale page
[23:47:26] <thomedy> and the more images you click on the more .animate({}) it does at a time
[23:47:45] <thomedy> i thought maybe event.stopPropogation but i dont think thats it now
[23:48:28] <lijzz> i need a plugin which implements both sorting and paging in a ul li list
[23:49:05] <Defrothew> Still stuck. :D
[23:49:19] <thomedy> any any suggestions
[23:49:23] <boogyman> what does "on" provide that "delegate" lacks?
[23:49:45] <thomedy> i dont know what it lacks but i know its the prefered method for 1.7
[23:50:12] <thomedy> and i know that delegate cant chain but that shouldn't matter because the way you call on is way different anyway
[23:50:16] <boogyman> a name change alone does not warranty a method change :| so i'm hoping there's some actual functionality differences
[23:50:38] <thomedy> yeah your right im just sharring
[23:51:10] <boogyman> warrant* Gah, it's too early to type
[23:51:41] <Eviltwin> boogyman: There's no functionality differences except that now .delegate calls .on and on does the work
[23:51:52] <Eviltwin> So it's technically slower to use .delegate
[23:52:01] <Eviltwin> Function calls aren't cheap in JavaScript
[23:52:24] <thomedy> then why is it the prefered method it says that in the docs
[23:52:44] <boogyman> but the purpose to change method names was what? a shorter declaration?
[23:53:14] <thomedy> the one word declarations in jquery arent really that difficult that would seem silly to me
[23:54:07] <coldhead> delegate is older
[23:54:15] <coldhead> on is a refactor
[23:54:51] <boogyman> so there are internal method changes
[23:55:15] <thomedy> i dont know what a refactor is but i do have to apologize for repeating myself has anyone gone to that page... im interested in going to bed and if i can (i understand if not) i would like to get a bit of  help
[23:55:18] <Eviltwin> thomedy: The other reason is that before we had a series of pairs .delegate/.undelegate, .live/.die, and .bind/.unbind
[23:55:30] <thomedy> oh i didn't know that
[23:55:39] <Eviltwin> These three things all operated on the events object associated with the element
[23:55:41] <thomedy> im still kind of new to delegate and live
[23:55:43] <Eviltwin> In very slightly different ways
[23:55:51] <thomedy> in fact this site i have built is the first time i have used it
[23:55:52] <Eviltwin> But could only be used with the appropriate pair
[23:55:58] <Eviltwin> Now it's very simple
[23:55:59] <Eviltwin> .on and .off
[23:56:09] <Eviltwin> Have the functionality of all three
[23:56:18] <thomedy> oh thats cool
[23:56:21] <boogyman> so pardon the analogy, but jq is moving towards the yui model?
[23:56:23] <Eviltwin> That's why
[23:56:36] <thomedy> i havent even touched yui yet
[23:56:48] <Eviltwin> boogyman: What do you consider the YUI model?
[23:57:02] <boogyman> regards to on/off
[23:57:14] <Eviltwin> I'm not terribly familiar with YUI
[23:57:26] <Eviltwin> So I don't know what that means
[23:57:31] <Eviltwin> "Moving towards the YUI model"
[23:58:28] <systemfault> boogyman: YUI kept a clear separation between even handling and event delegation...
[23:58:35] <systemfault> boogyman: That's not the jQuery approach
[23:59:06] <systemfault> But jQuery also using .on is a great idea imho.. looks nicer than .bind
[23:59:22] <thomedy> what is imho
