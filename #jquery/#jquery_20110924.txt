[00:27:11] <booboonathan> Hey giys
[00:27:14] <booboonathan> guys*
[00:27:20] <booboonathan> anyone up?
[00:27:31] <booboonathan> Trying to think of a name of a plugin but need some help jogging my memory :P
[00:35:23] <thinkclay> I'm up, whats the plugin?
[00:42:57] <coldhead> ask more specific questions >: |
[00:55:50] <stradade> i have a problem with this code http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1335242
[00:56:01] <stradade> anyone can say me something about ?
[00:56:18] <ravenzz> which part of that code ?
[00:57:11] <ravenzz> uhm
[00:57:16] <stradade> i write there the line that don't work
[00:57:55] <ravenzz> there are a lot of validation plugins
[00:58:14] <stradade> datastr have a limit  ???
[00:58:36] <ravenzz> also, you should handle the submit event
[00:58:46] <ravenzz> not the click one
[00:58:52] <ravenzz> ?serialize @ stradade
[00:58:53] <bot-t> stradade, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[00:59:41] <ravenzz> and of course, you need to sanitize/validate each field on the backend side
[00:59:46] <RubyTN> how can I get this phone regex to accept both x and ext. ^([1]{1}( |-|.)?)?([0-9]{3})( |-|.)?([0-9]{3}( |-|.)?[0-9]{4})(\s+|\s*[-\.x]{1}\d{1,6})?$
[01:00:10] <ravenzz> wat?
[01:00:35] <ravenzz> which is your phone numbers format?
[01:02:11] <ravenzz> 1-800-888-8888 -x48569
[01:02:12] <ravenzz> :?
[01:02:28] <RubyTN> ravenzz:yes
[01:02:53] <ravenzz> you can have an 1 or any number from 0 to 9 as 1st number?
[01:03:01] <RubyTN> I also want it to be able to accept 1-800-888-8888 ext. 48569
[01:03:20] <RubyTN> the first number must be a 1
[01:03:26] <ravenzz> is it mandatory?
[01:04:12] <RubyTN> ravenzz:no, its optional, the middle 10 are required and the extension is optional
[01:04:54] <RubyTN> ravenzz:  I have it all working except for allowing both -x and ext. for the extension
[01:06:08] <RubyTN> ravenzz:  this is what I am having trouble with:  (\s+|\s*[-\.x]{1}\d{1,6})?$
[01:06:32] <ravenzz> let me check
[01:06:45] <RubyTN> ravenzz:  k
[01:08:20] <stradade> serialize don't work ??? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/696045/
[01:09:11] <stradade> my mail is without data
[01:11:41] <coldhead> which seems more likely: that serialize is broken or you are doing it wrong?
[01:12:08] <ravenzz> stradade http://jsfiddle.net/MbSk5/
[01:12:23] <ravenzz> oh sorry
[01:12:29] <ravenzz> that was for RubyTN
[01:12:35] <ravenzz> RubyTN http://jsfiddle.net/MbSk5/
[01:16:07] <stradade> coldhead but what is the problem the dimension of datastr ???
[01:16:38] <stradade> coldhead why i cant store inside datastr more than 5 words ?
[01:17:54] <coldhead> stradade: maybe your html is broken
[01:19:33] <coldhead> stradade: http://jsfiddle.net/7fZLr/1/
[01:20:28] <Zxurian> assuming i'm only using "foo" once, is there any performance difference between var foo=$("#foo"); foo.find("li").each(function(){ do stuff });      and     $("#foo").find("li").each(function(){ do stuff });     ?
[01:21:56] <coldhead> not a significant one, Zxurian
[01:22:26] <coldhead> everything on the LHS of each() will have already been selected in either case
[01:25:57] <stradade> coldhead how can i use var s in the other my function ??
[01:30:55] <coldhead> either put the second function inside the first function
[01:31:00] <coldhead> or use a global variable
[01:31:11] <coldhead> window.__global_s = ...;
[01:31:13] <Zxurian> thank you
[01:32:55] <RubyTN> ravenzz:  I am getting a empty range in char class error msg
[01:33:55] <stradade> coldhead ur function reload sit too same errore thet give me the long string before
[01:34:08] <stradade> coldhead ur function reload entire site too same errore thet give me the long string before
[01:34:31] <RubyTN> ravenzz:  any ideas what could cause that?  it works perfectly when I use a regex tester, but when plugged into code I get that error
[01:55:03] <ravenzz> ?demo @ RubyTN
[01:55:03] <bot-t> RubyTN, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[02:44:03] <jajmon> how can i select, say all children of an <ul> except the first 10 ?
[02:44:44] <jajmon> i want to collapse a long list of items into just a few, for better display
[02:45:13] <jajmon> and have a clickable area where the user can expand the list to show all items
[02:45:17] <jajmon> whats the best practive?
[02:45:24] <jajmon> *practice

[02:49:18] <Servercrash> how to merge similar elements, i have something like <ul><li><ul>....</ul><ul>....</ul></li><li><ul>....</ul><ul>....</ul></li></ul>         i want to make it <ul><li><ul>..</ul><li><ul>..</ul></li></ul>, thats is merge the consecutive <ul> elements
[02:49:49] <vlt> jajmon: How about a foreach loop on the ul selection that checks whether the index is greater than 9?
[02:50:16] <Servercrash> index is greater than 9? whats 9 here
[02:50:27] <Servercrash> oh thats for jajmon ..
[02:50:54] <Servercrash> i read about extend
[02:51:36] <vlt> jajmon: Or even one that removes all elements below 10 and then breaks (for better performance)
[02:52:41] <jajmon> vit, the current list have +700 items and it can grow a lot. right now looping through it takes a few sec, which i think is too slow..
[02:53:04] <jajmon> and i want to be able to show them again
[02:53:18] <vlt> jajmon: See my 2nd idea.
[02:53:22] <jajmon> how would you write your 2nd idea?
[02:53:36] <jajmon> without a loop?
[02:55:12] <kontain> Hey guys, When I click on one of the thumbnails it 'refreshes' and then refreshes again then goes inside the inner page. Does anyone know why it's doing that? -http://www.kamranmotors.com/Core/index.php
[02:56:26] <vlt> jajmon: I have absolutely no jquery and only little js experience â€¦ but Iâ€™d fetch all the elements into an object, then run foreach (youâ€™ll have to find out how), check if(.index() < 10) and if yes, remove it from the object. Then if .index() >= 10 break that foreach loop.
[02:56:34] <Nuck> jQuery is too big for mobile (even if it *can* cache, it's still Too Damn Big) so what frameworks do people think I should use?
[02:57:19] <Nuck> I've been looking at Zeptojs, and it seems like a nice base, but it's not all that powerful sadly
[02:57:36] <kontain> can anyone help?
[03:00:45] <jajmon> vit, ah you mean like that
[03:02:16] <Nuck> Actually
[03:02:25] <Nuck> Zepto is fine and dandy for me >_>
[03:03:34] <Nuck> If Zepto provides me with everything I need, I'll just use that instead of jQuery lol
[03:04:09] <Nuck> Since it's compatible in APIs, and I mostly use jQuery for Sizzle and the shorthands (IDC about chaining, I don't use it that much)
[03:21:42] <Servercrash> how can i merge all consecutive <ul>..</ul> elements in a given section
[03:22:05] <Servercrash> with nested depth
[03:27:36] <dabear> Servercrash: get all uls, create one master ul with one li for each following ul, and add to the master uls li
[03:40:42] <dabear> Servercrash: this might work: http://jsfiddle.net/rdUn5/
[03:43:14] <snoy_ms> Hey there. I saw a line like "jQuery.ready();" (empty brackets) within some code. What could be the reason?
[03:46:57] <itmeoverHere> Hi all.
[03:48:13] <dabear> hola
[03:48:23] <itmeoverHere> wondering if there was a simpler, and more jQuery way to do this: $("#staticheader").get(0).childNodes[1].firstChild.nodeValue
[03:48:32] <dabear> is it you over there?
[03:48:52] <itmeoverHere> Want to get only the text out off the first found element.
[03:49:11] <itmeoverHere> Yeah, it's just me myslef and I ;)
[03:49:44] <dabear> wait, you have multiple elements with id="staticheader" ?
[03:50:04] <itmeoverHere> Nope, but it contains some other stuff.
[03:50:59] <dabear> $("#staticheader").children(":first").text()
[03:51:14] <dabear> children().first().text() will also work
[03:51:22] <itmeoverHere> I just _knew_ it would be simpler ;)
[03:53:05] <itmeoverHere> Works like a harm, thanks <dabear>!
[03:55:09] <itmeoverHere> hmm, was quite sure I tried your second suggestion. tried again, now it does work... ?!?!?.
[04:01:36] <itmeoverHere> Ok, now that I'm over here anyway. I was playing with this http://jsfiddle.net/k6wsg/24/ However, I don't get why the text doesn't fit!
[04:02:34] <itmeoverHere> Have been poking arround in there with innerHeigth() innerWidth etc, but not getting it working well.
[04:36:33] <snoy_ms> Sorry to ask again, but anyone knows if a line like "jQuery.ready();" (with empty brackets) makes sense? I saw this within some code.
[04:37:53] <rgr> when using jquery ajax call do I still need to manually encode the data as I would for an xmlhttprequest using POST ? e.g "var jsonreq = 'jsonsave=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(event));' for the data passed?
[04:38:09] <astropirate> rgr, nope
[04:38:24] <rgr> (the whole encoding/decoding/POST things is a real headache ;))
[04:38:47] <Servercrash> $("#nav li >ul").add($(this).next("ul"))   is this right method to merge to consecutive ul
[04:38:48] <rgr> astropirate: what about at the php back end? POST is still normal POST right?
[04:39:01] <astropirate> yup
[04:39:47] <dabear> rgr: Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs.
[04:39:54] <dabear> see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:40:18] <Servercrash> ??
[04:40:42] <dabear> Servercrash: didn't I give you a solution earlier?
[04:41:19] <dabear> Servercrash: see http://jsfiddle.net/rdUn5/ - it merges multiple uls into a single ul
[04:41:19] <rgr> astropirate: hmm, no.
[04:41:28] <astropirate> o_O
[04:41:40] <rgr> with that line above it works, if I remove the encode and jsonify it doesnt.
[04:41:54] <rgr> (brand new to this so bare with me ;)
[04:42:29] <Servercrash> dabear, sorry i guess i messed that
[04:42:39] <astropirate> rgr, which ajax method are you using?
[04:42:41] <astropirate> .post() ?
[04:43:34] <Servercrash> dabear, i am not trying to merge with parents, i am trying to merge consecutive
[04:43:52] <rgr> astropirate: http://pastebin.com/f8cZ2CEy
[04:44:20] <dabear> Servercrash: that's what my code does
[04:44:38] <astropirate> rgr, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:45:09] <dabear> or you could just do .not(":first") if you want a maximum total of two uls on the page, Servercrash
[04:45:25] <rgr> ?
[04:45:33] <astropirate> rgr, if a POST is what you want. else use GET
[04:45:40] <Servercrash> ok
[04:45:42] <rgr> That doesnt say anything about the issue of encoding.
[04:45:52] <rgr> cant use get as the data might be too big
[04:45:59] <rgr> (afaik)
[04:47:32] <rgr> ok, so it seems I do indeed have to encode manually in the data field. if I do so it works fine.
[04:48:29] <dabear> rgr: what are you trying to do?
[04:48:50] <rgr> simply use jquery ajax with post. Its working.
[04:48:52] <Elephant> rgr: you're using firebug/web inspector right?
[04:48:58] <rgr> yes.
[04:49:03] <rgr> I mean no.. chrome
[04:49:20] <Elephant> web inspector is built into chrome
[04:49:27] <rgr> yes I know. And?
[04:49:49] <rgr> The main confusion I have is when to escape/encode with POST.
[04:50:04] <rgr> And bringing jquery into it added another layer of obfuscation.
[04:50:16] <dabear> you shouldn't have to do any escaping with jquery
[04:50:47] <rgr> Mabye noe escaping but I DO have to do this for it to work :     var jsonreq = 'jsonsave=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(event));
[04:50:58] <rgr> where jsonreq is the "data" component to the ajax post call.
[04:51:08] <rgr> and event is the data to be sent
[04:51:45] <rgr> Aha! I see where I got confused. All is clear now. Thanks.
[04:52:04] <dabear> cant you set data to {"jsonreq": JSON.stringify(event)} ?
[04:52:15] <dabear> jsonsave*
[04:52:15] <Elephant> he can certainly leave super quickly.
[04:52:23] <dabear> gah
[04:52:25] <dabear> yeah
[04:54:13] <rgr> Hmm maybe not. If the event record which I stringify contains "&" etc it still needs to be processed before the jquery post with encodeURIComponent.
[04:55:01] <rgr> Or is there a better way to build up my "data" field for the jquery ajax post call?
[04:56:44] <ciss> rgr: a common way to populate the data property is to use $('#my-form').serialize()
[04:59:32] <rgr> aha, the correct way is simply :         data: {jsonsave : JSON.stringify(event)},     in the ajax constructor.
[04:59:32] <rgr>  
[05:02:42] <ciss> i take it event is not an event object passed to a handler?
[05:06:40] <Andri_> anybody implementing jquery tabs as megamenu?
[05:11:18] <dabear> rgr: yeah I said that earlier but you left :p
[05:11:29] <dabear> <dabear> cant you set data to {"jsonreq": JSON.stringify(event)} ?
[05:11:58] <rgr> heh : boy does jquery tidy up my junk.
[05:12:53] <troubleman> rgr: i hear that :)
[05:12:55] <ciss> that's what she said
[05:13:01] <troubleman> lololol
[05:13:22] <troubleman> jquery sure is popular among the females
[05:24:15] <delfis> hello :)
[05:24:26] <delfis> could you suggest me what to use for showing poll results?
[05:24:34] <delfis> something simple with graphical columns :)
[05:27:38] <troubleman> delfis: elycharts
[05:29:03] <delfis> i thinks its too difficult :)
[05:29:38] <troubleman> well i think you're an idiot
[05:31:47] <troubleman> sorry i said that delfis
[05:31:50] <troubleman> i have an anger management problem
[05:35:36] <Elephant> lol
[05:36:57] <delfis> troubleman i just need one type, and there is huge thing :)
[05:41:07] <ciss> i'd love to have your opinions on code readability when working with configurable class or element names. i've provided examples for two slightly different approaches: http://jsfiddle.net/pKsaA/
[05:43:01] <PrgmrBill> how can I change this selector to only include visible rows: $('#table tr:not(.listingShadowRow):nth-child(even)') ?
[05:46:27] <dabear> PrgmrBill: :visible
[05:46:42] <dabear> ?:visible @ PrgmrBill
[05:46:43] <bot-t> PrgmrBill, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[05:46:59] <PrgmrBill> I knew about that, but where do I put it?
[05:47:18] <PrgmrBill> I tried at the end, and inside of the parenthesis. both broke it
[05:59:15] <rgr> whats the jq function to display/hide an element based on a true/false parameter? show() takes a duration and I dont necessarily want to toggle.
[05:59:53] <ciss> rgr: you can use show without any arguments
[06:01:09] <rgr> no, I need to pass a "hide" or "show" bool/flag or do I misunderstand you?
[06:01:30] <rgr> currently based on the flag in my own func I set the display property to block or none.
[06:09:49] <Elephant> ?demo @ rgr
[06:09:49] <bot-t> rgr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:10:31] <rgr> seems pretty obvious to me. Dont worry, I use my own func and switch to show or hide.
[06:10:48] <kontain> Hello, can anyone help me ?
[06:10:52] <rgr> just ask
[06:11:05] <kontain> http://www.kamranmotors.com/Core/index.php - The left section where it lists all the tags
[06:11:23] <kontain> When 'user' clicks on "BMW" for instance it should only show it's thumbs.
[06:11:38] <kontain> The function use to work before but it's not displaying it anymore.
[06:11:43] <Connor_> Performance question, when I want to pass a dom element to a function, which is faster; to pass a jQuery object or a plain object?
[06:11:54] <Connor_> Eg, someFunction($(this)); or someFunction(this)
[06:12:45] <kontain> rgr: it's in corefunction.js
[06:13:21] <rgr> I meant "just ask" dont ask to ask .. ;) dabear might help ;)
[06:14:09] <dabear> what?
[06:14:45] <kontain> dabear: can you help?
[06:15:04] <dabear> with what?
[06:15:46] <dabear> rgr: use .toggle() ? or use $("foo")[ yourflag ? "show" : "hide"]()
[06:16:18] <kontain> dabear: It's there in corefunctions.js but for some reason something is interrupting.
[06:16:20] <rgr> toggle doesnt take a flag : it just toggles. the other one is nice though! teaches me a lot thanks!
[06:16:22] <kontain> dabear: can you please check
[06:16:58] <stevehartley> Hi, Having problems with css conflicts using liferay 5.2.3 and jqueryui trying to use dialog widget. Application.css from liferay's classic theme is applying styles as the class names used are same as jqueryui. Anyone else got experience of using jqueryui with liferay 5.2.3?
[06:17:57] <dabear> rgr: basically $("foo")["show"]() === $("foo").show()
[06:18:57] <rgr> sure, nice. And thanks.
[06:21:41] <Connor_> http://stackoverflow.com/q/7539272/471134 - If anyone could help with that, I would be most appreciative :)
[06:22:33] <dabear> Connor_: generally don't worry about it
[06:22:52] <Connor_> Is there any performance benefit at all or is it pretty similar?
[06:23:04] <dabear> but avoid using $() too much
[06:23:15] <dabear> you shouldn't worry about performance
[06:23:20] <dabear> it does not matter in this case
[06:23:29] <Connor_> Fair enough
[06:23:37] <Connor_> Thanks :)
[06:23:49] <dabear> this is micro optimization
[06:23:58] <paul23> hi
[06:24:10] <kinga> hi, in the callback function from complete: function(response){} in order to alert the response from the script, i would just alert(response);
[06:24:23] <kinga> but now, i don't know what happened, i have to type alert(response.response)
[06:24:31] <kinga> because response is a xmlhttprequest object
[06:24:40] <dabear> ?complete
[06:24:42] <bot-t> dabear, Plugins/Autocomplete - Autocomplete an input field to enable users quickly finding and selecting some value, leveraging searching and filtering. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete
[06:25:01] <paul23> I'm doing a proof of concept, to see what I need to fill my needs - but I'm wondering, can jquery be used to handle connections to another server?
[06:25:45] <Guest29151> i need something to select only elements that contain an exact value (:contains will not work here)
[06:25:55] <paul23> IE: my html5 game is posted at a portal site. However it interacts with a personal server (hiscores, chat etc) - is this possible?
[06:26:46] <dabear> Guest29151: $("foo").filter( function(){  return this.innerHTML === "your value"})
[06:26:52] <kinga> paul23, afaik the browser won't let you do requests from a different domain, that's a standard security rule
[06:27:02] <Guest29151> thanks dabear =]
[06:27:32] <rgr> dabear: keeping in mind I'm new to js in general and jq only today, is this "tight" or am I getting my "types" wrong. Simply want to show/hide a field based on whether another one is empty or not. Or do I need to use length()?     $("#duration")[ $("startdate").val() ? "show" :"hide"]();
[06:27:39] <paul23> hmm not even with postMessage? - Or after a confirmation? Seems html5 is quite limiting compared to flash then :(
[06:28:07] <kinga> i'm not an expert at jquery, i just know that
[06:28:40] <kinga> you can't make requests or load DOM elements from another document that's on another server
[06:28:50] <rgr> ack. is(":empty")
[06:29:01] <paul23> kk np, searching a bit more.. If all else fails I'll write a java layer I guess.
[06:29:21] <rgr> oh maybe not.
[06:29:22] <dabear> rgr: that would work, if startdate is really an element that exist
[06:29:31] <dabear> I guess you want #startdate though
[06:29:34] <rgr> yes it is. But is it "clean"?
[06:29:55] <Connor_> Do you want to see if its empty, or if it exists?
[06:29:55] <rgr> I mean I can use the string val() as a bool in the ?: swicth.
[06:30:15] <rgr> pretty clear from the code I want to see if its empty.
[06:30:40] <Connor_> if($('select').html().length) { //stuff in it } else { }
[06:30:44] <rgr> but thats more a script syntax/semantics Q I guess rather than jquery
[06:30:45] <dabear> rgr: any empty string is false
[06:30:54] <rgr> Connor_ thats horrible ;)

[06:31:11] <rgr> thanks a lot once more. All coming together now.
[06:31:52] <ciss> is there a noticable difference between "context.find(selector)" and "$(selector, context)" ?
[06:32:12] <Connor_> Never use the context argument
[06:32:28] <Connor_> $(contentElement).find('.selector');
[06:32:38] <ciss> why?
[06:32:51] <Connor_> Paul irish did a good few slides on it, one sec
[06:33:43] <kinga> can some1 answer my inquiry ? :)
[06:33:53] <kinga> hi, in the callback function from complete: function(response){} in order to alert the response from the script, i would just alert(response);
[06:34:04] <kinga> but now, i don't know what happened, i have to type alert(response.response) because response is a xmlhttprequest object
[06:34:08] <Connor_> @ciss
[06:34:08] <Connor_> <kinga> but now, i don't know what happened, i have to
[06:34:12] <Connor_> Whoops

[06:34:34] <Connor_> @ciss http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[06:34:36] <kinga> np, i just copy pasted what i said initially
[06:34:45] <Connor_> Around slide 20
[06:35:11] <Connor_> Also the video is good too (y)
[06:35:58] <kinga> my script has a lot of inconsistencies lol
[06:36:06] <kinga> some functions use response other use response.response
[06:36:13] <Connor_> Time to have a spring clean @kinga :P
[06:36:21] <ciss> Connor_: you don't happen to remember the slide index, do you? :)
[06:36:32] <Connor_> The slide number?
[06:36:33] <Connor_> 20
[06:36:56] <Connor_> Not sure where abouts in the video he talks about it though
[06:37:31] <kinga> not to mention the fact that even if i specify dataType: json
[06:37:38] <kinga> jquery doesn't automatically parses it
[06:37:53] <kinga> and i have to revert back to dataType: text, and parse it with parseJSON()
[06:38:06] <kinga> and it worked before, so i don't know what happened
[06:38:36] <kinga> i'm using $.ajaxSetup() in the beginning of the script
[06:39:13] <kinga> dataType is text by default, but when i need json, in a specific function, i just type dataType: 'json' there... does this overwrite the default? or appends it ?
[06:39:14] <ciss> Connor_: the slides only mention readability as an argument for using find() over context
[06:39:38] <Connor_> It's more of a convention, no-one really uses context anymore
[06:40:18] <Connor_> because doing $('.selector', context) is the EXACT (I mean, jQuery translates it and does the this) $(context).find('.selector');
[06:40:44] <ciss> Connor_: thanks, good to know :)
[06:41:16] <Connor_> Np :)
[06:41:40] <kinga> no one can help me :( ? so it seems like that my issue is weird enough
[06:41:43] <rgr> kinga: you know the default type is "clever guess"? Works for me..
[06:41:48] <kinga> i know
[06:41:56] <kinga> but i'm a perfectionist :D
[06:42:20] <kinga> clever  guess relies on content-type ?
[06:42:29] <kinga> or does it really analyses the string ?
[06:42:42] <kinga> analyze*
[06:54:47] <jedimind> wrong button
[07:01:13] <Connor_> Does anyoen know what version of JS IE 7,8 and 0 use
[07:01:15] <Connor_> 9*
[07:08:29] <rgr> erm, I need to use $("#field")attr({value : VAL}) to set the value of a field? nothing shorter?
[07:11:13] <pachet> rgr: $('#field').val('foo')
[07:11:33] <rgr> thanks. my google fu is not strong today.
[07:11:41] <MeirD> Hello
[07:11:42] <rgr> but should have seen that in the val api
[07:11:55] <MeirD> What is the jQuery way to create a class with methods/properties?
[07:14:06] <pachet> same as the js way, except that you can use $.extend to situationally modify prototypes
[07:14:06] <rgr> I guess I cant use val() for check boxes too where any non nil value means checkde?
[07:17:02] <MeirD> ok.. I see many uses of var something = { first_name: something, second_name : something , someFunction : function () {...} }
[07:17:13] <MeirD> It looks like kind of a static class
[07:23:17] <pachet> rgr: with checkboxes, the val (at least from jquery's perspective) corresponds to the value attribute hardcoded for that element, not the actual checked state
[07:24:24] <pachet> you'll notice that if you omit the explicit "value" attribute from your html and run a $(':checkbox').eq(0).val(), it will return 'on' regardless of the checked state
[07:25:20] <pachet> so to your point, you can use .val() on checkboxes, but unless you've set value="something" in the element, or with .val('something'), then calling that method will return 'on'
[07:25:32] <pachet> which is kind of pointless
[07:26:20] <pachet> $('foo').is(':checked') will return the actual checked state
[07:40:14] <solsTiCe> how do you bind a key to a button ? for example when I press Enter I want a given button to behave as if it got a click . is it possible ? I need a plugin for that ?
[07:41:00] <solsTiCe> ooops keydown event will do that
[07:54:14] <Servercrash> dabear, this is all i need to merge the consecutive <ul>..</ul> <ul> ...</ul>,  probably can be done in better way too  $('#nav li').each(function(){	   foo=$('> ul:first',this);          $('> ul:first',this).next('ul').children().prependTo(foo); 	   $('> ul:first',this).next('ul').remove(); });
[07:54:58] <dabear> uh
[07:55:00] <dabear> ugly
[07:55:07] <Servercrash> ya might be very ugly
[07:55:16] <Servercrash> but does the job :D
[07:56:44] <compact> http://www.irchorseracing.net/new/index2.php?page=getting_started <--- any idea when page opens, all tabs are open
[07:57:11] <Servercrash> dabear, anyway thanks :) got this done...time to move out :D
[07:58:06] <ciss> any recommendations for a plugin that can perform a string search on set of elements and their children and return matching elements?
[07:58:45] <ciss> something a little more advanced than :contains, but still fast?
[07:59:12] <rgr> anything obviously wrong with this : $("#search").click(function(){alert("!");this.select();});
[07:59:21] <rgr> (trying to select all contect when I click in)
[07:59:24] <rgr> content
[07:59:35] <ciss> wouldn't even mind if it creates an internal index on activation
[08:00:18] <ciss> rgr: $(this)
[08:01:09] <rgr> $(this).select(); ?
[08:01:29] <rgr> still not working. bet its something silly.
[08:03:13] <ciss> rgr: care to provide a fiddle?
[08:03:29] <compact> rgr any idea with me :P

[08:33:30] <Segaja> find the row you want to insert the row after and do elem.after('<tr />');, webguynow
[08:34:43] <webguynow> ah yes - can I also do  elem.before  to put the row 1st  ?
[08:35:10] <Segaja> http://api.jquery.com/before/
[08:35:32] <Segaja> so the answer is: yes you can
[08:36:53] <webguynow> I think I'm almost there.  thx
[08:47:39] <ciss> is there any easy way to determine if an element A appears before an element B in the dom? the elements don't have to be siblings

[08:55:32] <friskd> Question about what error codes should be sent for correct UI flow.
[08:56:02] <friskd> I have an API built. image my customer wants to process an order. they call the api to process. But they don't have shipping info on file.
[08:56:21] <friskd> so i need to return a json response as well as an http status code
[08:57:10] <friskd> Im not quite sure if it should be a 200, 304, 400 or 500.
[08:57:44] <friskd> The request is good. But the user needs to do more.. which to me means in the normal flow i would redirect... hence 300.
[09:00:18] <webguynow> I've got something weird going on with my page, and my .before  test prototype (good to view source)
[09:00:28] <webguynow> http://208.116.60.233/OSR/Clients/banddatt2.php
[09:00:39] <webguynow> console error  bugging out
[09:06:22] <webguynow> unterminated regular expression literal
[09:06:57] <webguynow> but I think the reason why - is it's in an XSLT page - maybe something different about that
[09:07:28] <webguynow> probably have to use  special entity for  <  and >
[09:08:03] <webguynow> not sure, yet
[09:17:50] <webguynow> banddatt2  works not - I'm not sure why I had to separate and concat each <td> for it to Not Bug
[09:17:56] <webguynow> works now
[09:18:47] <ciss> cool... memory profiling for firebug ...
[09:22:46] <Xenc> heya! does anyone know how to trigger the autocomplete event in UI
[09:24:52] <JohnnyDavidson> how do i rotate elements?
[09:25:06] <friskd> I have an API http status code question. Imagine my customer wants to process an order. they call the api to process. But they don't have shipping info on file. So i need to return a json response as well as an http status code Im not quite sure if it should be a 200, 304, 400 or 500. The request is good. But the user needs to do more.. which to me means in the normal flow i would redirect... hence 3xx In my case the API is used for both
[09:25:06] <friskd> jquery, and mobile and i'm trying to determine the proper flow for all this.
[09:26:24] <Elephant> friskd: if it's not a connectivity or HTTP problem, I would just stick to 200.
[09:26:35] <LoG1c\0x\> hi
[09:26:40] <r1ch> hey, does anyone know whats wrong with this  buttons: { price+" \u003E\u003E": function () { $(this).dialog('close'); } }             Error Msg: missing : after property id
[09:26:46] <LoG1c\0x\> I have an array, how do I count it?
[09:27:03] <LoG1c\0x\> .length returns them in arrays, and doesnt increment it
[09:27:21] <Elephant> LoG1c\0x\: .each()?
[09:27:31] <friskd> Elephant:  So then what else would i provide so that the client can then decipher how to respond. I suppose i would then need another error code
[09:27:51] <Segaja> r1ch: try to put buttons in ' '
[09:28:00] <Elephant> Well what is the expected output?
[09:28:12] <friskd> that distguishes between Success order processed vs. Success: You need to update your shipping info.
[09:28:39] <friskd> Thus the client would need to also know that its like Success: 84393 = require shipping info.
[09:28:43] <Elephant> Well it's not a success if you don't have shipping ingo?
[09:29:07] <friskd> right but 200 dictates a success
[09:29:08] <friskd> right?
[09:29:12] <Elephant> in HTTP
[09:29:15] <r1ch> Segaja: that doesn't seem to workâ€¦ the error has only appeared after i tried to print the variable price before that string
[09:29:23] <Elephant> it means that HTTP was able to deliver the page from the web server
[09:29:38] <Elephant> not that the server-side script completed without issues.
[09:29:42] <Elephant> well, it completed.
[09:29:54] <Elephant> just not "sucessfully"
[09:30:39] <friskd> right. So im trying to decide a solid methodoly for this because if i return a 400 or 500 jquery will detect it as an "error" and thus call the error callback
[09:31:13] <Elephant> Yeah, so why not return an array with your own error code, and the results.
[09:31:32] <r1ch> frisked - why don't you just return an error handler with your json response?
[09:32:00] <r1ch> *friskd - why don't you just return an error handler with your json response?
[09:32:21] <Elephant> ala array("Status" => 1, "Results" => "Super Cool Text") | array("Status" => 404, "Results" => "Shipping Info not found.")
[09:32:27] <friskd> because this is a standard api that will also be used for mobile etc.
[09:32:43] <Elephant> so make that the standard...
[09:33:13] <r1ch> Im with elephant on this one you will save yourself a headache further down the line if you define your own error handling
[09:34:45] <friskd> Ok. So basically a successful http request should respond with 200
[09:34:55] <friskd> but could also have its own subcode/message
[09:35:04] <r1ch> yes
[09:35:27] <friskd> fair enough
[09:40:49] <wilrod> I noticed that in the PRISM Stocktrader sample they have references to Service classes in their viewModels that seem to do some fetching of data, is this approach considered ok?
[09:41:42] <wilrod> It just feels a bit wrong having that kind of logic in the model classes
[09:42:13] <wilrod> Uhm, wrong channel :D

[09:59:59] <RandoMMeR> hi, i have page where gallery is being animated to hide and another one is being animated to show up, function is called from menu to show different galleries. but if you click more times across menu buttons, it shows more than one gallery, despite the script closing all visible divs in the beggining. can you help me somehow?
[10:05:52] <djQuery> RandoMMeR: see ?demo
[10:05:53] <bot-t> RandoMMeR, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[10:06:38] <RandoMMeR> gallerific plugin also has this problem
[10:08:04] <djQuery> Xenc: go look at the demos. there is one that has a button next to the input that shows the autocomplete. That should get you started. see ?ui.autocomplete
[10:08:05] <bot-t> Xenc, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:08:23] <Xenc> thanks djQuery, it turns out i was looking at the wrong documentation
[10:08:28] <Xenc> i was looking at plugins/autocomplete
[10:08:32] <Xenc> which is something else :/
[10:09:37] <djQuery> Xenc: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[10:09:57] <djQuery> Xenc: yeah think that one is depreciated
[10:10:04] <Xenc> indeed
[10:11:34] <RandoMMeR> djQuery: will you look at the issue? but i will need your ip, so i can grant you the access to the server :-/
[10:11:53] <djQuery> RandoMMeR: probably not
[10:12:24] <RandoMMeR> djQuery: just give it a shot, you will probably know what is the problem right away
[10:12:36] <RandoMMeR> i just cant figure it out
[10:13:01] <Layke> Whats the element called, where it's like a menu, and is hidden until you click on it?
[10:13:04] <djQuery> then put together a public demo
[10:13:18] <Layke> So you might have a long bar, and when you click it drops down and reveals it's contents.

[10:18:28] <ZGirl> Anybody have any recommendation for an inheritance pattern that works with jQuery? I have read a ton of articles about this, but most include a "magic" function to create classes. Any snippets that use jQuery to do the magic (to avoid the extra JS)? Thanks!
[10:21:24] <RandoMMeR> pls go to http://88.212.33.244/archima then click on "projekty" in the top menu. gallery will open with menu on the right side. click any item and then immediately click another item. two galleries will appear despite fact that script should be closing one gallery
[10:25:15] <rgr> does the bot have a stock response for recommended advanced jquery references?

[10:35:45] <ciss> i always keep forgetting this: how can i json-encode an object with jquery or javascript?
[10:36:05] <ngharo> you can only call each directly on a jQuery object, else you must do $.each(var, function() {})
[10:36:26] <ngharo> ?stringify @ ciss
[10:36:27] <bot-t> ciss, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.

[12:18:58] <guy> ?
[12:19:16] <Hooloovoo> guy: you're trying to make a plugin?
[12:25:12] <pulse00> hi all. anyone knows how to make a div fire a custom event when it's being loaded via ajax?
[12:25:21] <pulse00> so i can use .live() with that event?
[12:25:52] <guy> Hooloovoo: sort of.
[12:26:00] <guy> learning/making plugin
[12:26:28] <Hooloovoo> guy: ahhh. have a look at this then
[12:26:42] <Hooloovoo> http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/jquery-plugin-boilerplate-revisited/
[12:27:04] <Hooloovoo> that's a ok boilerplate for plugins
[12:27:29] <Andrevan> pulse00, you could do something like $('div').live(function() { $(this).trigger('customEvent') }); I think
[12:28:29] <pulse00> does .live(function()) work? i'm getting errors when the first argument is not a string literal
[12:28:33] <Andrevan> ah right
[12:28:34] <Andrevan> try this
[12:28:36] <Andrevan> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery
[12:28:58] <pulse00> hm, okay thanks. thought this plugin was replaced by .live() completely
[12:29:01] <newb001> hey people, does anyone have idea why a hover method of an id might not work inside an object method?
[12:29:14] <Andrevan> the difference is that you don't need to pass it an event at all
[12:29:26] <alexandroid> live needs to be a comma separated list of selectors for the first argument, and an anonymous function or whatever for the second argument
[12:29:35] <newb001> i get Uncaught TypeError: Object #xy, #yx has no method 'hover'
[12:29:36] <alexandroid> hm never tried livequery
[12:29:50] <Andrevan> alexandroid, first argument is the event I believe
[12:30:03] <ArchAdmin> hi
[12:30:05] <ArchAdmin> anybody alive?
[12:30:09] <Andrevan> ie .live('change', function() { doUpdate() });
[12:30:26] <guy> Hooloovoo: looks pretty boring.
[12:30:27] <ArchAdmin> can somebody help me?
[12:30:29] <Andrevan> livequery can take one argument
[12:30:36] <Andrevan> ArchAdmin, just ask
[12:30:43] <ArchAdmin> i have a div with variable height
[12:30:48] <pulse00> i'm trying to attach a custom plugin to divs which are being loaded via ajax. is this possible with .live()? or do i need livequery for that?
[12:30:48] <ArchAdmin> i have a guestbook inside
[12:31:05] <ArchAdmin> i want to make it without scrolls, and so that it occupy all available height
[12:31:06] <guy> also, I don't get it why they are extending jQuery in that boilerplate $.pluginName
[12:31:15] <ArchAdmin> and so it will paginate if it doesn't fit
[12:31:25] <ArchAdmin> are there any ready to use plugins for that?
[12:31:42] <alexandroid> Andreven the event yes sorry
[12:31:46] <alexandroid> keyboard slip
[12:31:58] <Andrevan> pulse00, I think the issue is that you can't trigger live on a load event
[12:32:31] <Guevara> Hi guys! I have this pagination in tab, if i click in "proximo"(next), back to the first tab, how fix this?http://postimage.org/image/1682p0kjo/ code: http://dpaste.com/620341/
[12:34:42] <pulse00> that seems like not such an unusual task: attaching some behaviour to dom elements which are being loaded via ajax. surprises me that .live() can't do this.
[12:35:00] <Eviltwin> What can't .live do?
[12:35:09] <Andrevan> $live('load'
[12:35:24] <Eviltwin> You mean listen for anything to load?
[12:35:27] <Andrevan> right
[12:35:34] <Eviltwin> I don't believe load events bubble
[12:35:34] <alystair> while debugging in chrome, is there a way to disable caching in the browser temporarily?
[12:35:39] <Andrevan> Eviltwin, right
[12:35:58] <pulse00> so how do people invoke their plugins on ajax-loaded elements?
[12:35:59] <Andrevan> the solution I've used is the livequery plugin
[12:36:29] <pulse00> ie. $('.someDiv').myPlugin() <--- does only work for elements which exist on document.ready.
[12:36:30] <Eviltwin> pulse00: You use $.ajax : success, and then $.html
[12:37:00] <pulse00> i'm not firing the ajax request. a java webframework does that for me
[12:37:10] <Eviltwin> A *JAVA* webframework?
[12:37:20] <pulse00> indeed
[12:37:24] <Eviltwin> Wow
[12:37:31] <RandoMMeR> hi, i have page where gallery is being animated to hide and another one is being animated to show up, function is called from menu to show different galleries. but if you click more times across menu buttons, it shows more than one gallery, despite the script closing all visible divs in the beggining. can you help me somehow?  demo: pls go to http://88.212.33.244/archima then click on "projekty" in the top menu. gallery will open w
[12:37:35] <pulse00> amazing, isn't it?
[12:37:41] <Eviltwin> Amazingly terrible, yes
[12:37:56] <Andrevan> pulse00, just try livequery dude
[12:38:17] <pulse00> Andrevan: kk, thanks
[12:49:16] <RobW> Hi, does anyone have any functions/sliders/etc executed before dom displays it? That way there's no "flash" of lists then it turns into a slider?
[12:49:34] <RobW> does anyone know how to have functions/sliders/etc built before dom displays them*
[12:49:39] <RobW> does this make sense..
[12:50:20] <alexandroid> um
[12:50:33] <alexandroid> display:none maybe in css?
[12:50:43] <alexandroid> then change it back when the dom is loaded?
[12:51:16] <RobW> so it will still be built even though it's hidden?
[12:51:21] <RobW> guess I can try one sec
[12:52:05] <Eviltwin> $("element").plugin(...).show();
[12:52:09] <Eviltwin> Afterwards
[12:52:45] <RobW> sorry?
[12:52:54] <RobW> oh , yea. chaining
[12:53:03] <Eviltwin> element { display: none; }
[12:53:09] <Eviltwin> Then in your JavaScript $("element").plugin(...).show();
[12:53:12] <RobW> well there's a few plugins being executed after every ajax page load, so I just have it $('div').show
[12:53:19] <Eviltwin> Well I guess "selector" instead of "element"
[12:53:46] <RobW> heh
[12:54:00] <Eviltwin> It's generally bad to make assumptions at the element level
[12:54:05] <Hooloovoo> guy: well, it's extending jquery because it's a jquery plugin
[12:54:12] <Hooloovoo> and that's pretty much what those does.
[12:54:21] <guy> that's not what I've meant...
[12:54:23] <geekbuntu> anyone know how much different a theme-rolled ui pkg is than a regular? is it just css?
[12:54:47] <jrockjiggz> RobW: if you google, theres lots of info about this prob. http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/10/1-way-to-avoid-the-flash-of-unstyled-content
[12:55:17] <jrockjiggz> simple solution tho :)
[12:58:33] <bapi_> I'm looking for a text animation of some sort, basically I want one of my links to "glow" or that is, go from 0.4 opacity to 1 in durations
[13:01:14] <bapi_> you could say glowin gtext
[13:01:18] <bapi_> glowing text*
[13:05:26] <alexandroid> google for jquery animate
[13:05:50] <alexandroid> or if you want to use css3, google for css3 keyframe animations and, if necessary, pseudo selectors
[13:06:27] <alystair> Is there any way using JS to check if a file is already in the browser cache?
[13:32:11] <quuxman_> I've got an interested issue with sellections
[13:34:09] <quuxman_> If I have a one word anchor tag, and that word is sellected, range.commonAncestorContainer is the anchor's parentNode, not the anchor like I'd expect
[13:40:55] <quuxman_> it's actually even more subtle than that. If I drag a selection over the word, it's fine, and what I'd expect
[13:41:10] <quuxman_> if I double click on the word, then the commonAncestorContainer is wrong in my opinion
[13:43:45] <Tangaroa> http://pastebin.com/H6TPGAbT  When I use addClass() and removeClass() inside a .find().each() callback, no changes are made to the elements in the DOM. Is it possible that find+each works on copies of the nodes rather than references? And could someone suggest a working alternative for what I am trying to do?
[13:45:21] <ajpiano> Tangaroa: that certainly isn't the case.
[13:47:44] <ajpiano> Tangaroa: can you show a live demo of this failing?
[13:47:55] <dabear> document.body.innerHTML +=
[13:48:05] <dabear> ^^that should have sideeffects
[13:48:27] <ajpiano> Tangaroa: there are other ways to debug things besides append debug messages to the bottom of the DOM
[13:48:44] <Tangaroa> dabear: good catch, I'll change that and check it again
[13:48:56] <ajpiano> Tangaroa: see ?demo
[13:48:57] <bot-t> Tangaroa, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:50:35] <Tangaroa> The problem was the buggy debugging method. It works now. Thanks for the help.
[13:51:51] <ajpiano> ahhh the classic heisenbug
[13:55:50] <dabear> I like SchrÃ¶dinbugs
[13:55:53] <dabear> those are more fun
[14:27:19] <alystair> is there a way to detect if an item is located in cache via js?
[14:44:07] <johnywp> hey all
[14:44:14] <johnywp> i am using a plugin to style a form
[14:44:28] <johnywp> and i get a flicker of the unstyled form before it loads
[14:44:48] <johnywp> after research i found that this is reffered to as FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
[14:45:03] <johnywp> and was told that it could be avoided by hiding the unstyled element
[14:45:49] <johnywp> i tried it, but my plugin doesn't really unhide the element - it styles on top of the element... so if i hide the main element then nothing will show. Any ideas?
[14:48:56] <Moridine> johnywp: possibly use the show callback?
[14:51:14] <ciss> johnywp: if for some reason your plugin is unable to style the form while it is set to display: none, use visibility:hidden in combination with a loading animation
[14:58:13] <johnywp> thank you both for the suggestions
[14:58:22] <johnywp> here is where it gets complicated
[14:58:31] <johnywp> moridine: not sure how to do that :S
[14:59:00] <johnywp> ciss: i have the plugin styling the form and then i have the form fading in (using opacity 0 to opacity 1,3000)
[14:59:37] <johnywp> if i use visibility hidden and switch it after the plugin has loaded, then the fading part doesn't work
[15:00:09] <ciss> johnywp: it does: just make sure you set the opacity to 0 before you start fading
[15:01:04] <ciss> 1. opacity: 0 - 2. visibility: visible - 3. fade in
[15:01:12] <johnywp> oh... hmm
[15:01:16] <johnywp> let me see
[15:02:02] <ciss> you can alternatively skip visibility:hidden and set opacity: 0 initially
[15:04:11] <ryrych> hi
[15:04:57] <ryrych> chrome canâ€™t change cursor when mouse is down and it doesnâ€™t move: http://jsbin.com/iqadep/6
[15:05:10] <ryrych> is it a browser bug or jQueryâ€™s?
[15:06:22] <gaiada> hi all, could anyone tell me how do i parse json using post instead getJSON?
[15:07:33] <ciss> gaiada: $.parseJSON
[15:07:49] <ciss> or simply use .ajax()
[15:08:03] <gaiada> hmm
[15:08:11] <Blaster> whats the best way to test posting to a url?  For ajax
[15:08:25] <gaiada>  im tryin something like this but without success
[15:09:07] <ciss> ryrych: you need to consider mouseout as well
[15:09:08] <gaiada> but thanks now i think im in the right way :)
[15:10:08] <ciss> Blaster: jsfiddle.net provides an api for that
[15:10:59] <ryrych> ciss: but it works in firefox and mouseout is when mouse is released
[15:11:32] <ciss> ryrych: mouseup is only detected if it happens inside the element
[15:12:11] <ciss> ryrych: attach the mouseup event to body, do that inside your mousedown event handler
[15:12:12] <ryrych> ciss: but thatâ€™s mousedown which is affected in chrome
[15:13:00] <ryrych> ciss: the cursor is not changed when mousedown is fired
[15:13:04] <ciss> ryrych: btw, i strongly recommend that you use jquery ui if you want to implement complex interactions
[15:13:16] <ciss> ryrych: it is, in firefox and chrome
[15:13:43] <ciss> hm, you're right
[15:13:44] <ryrych> ciss: do you have â€˜moveâ€™ cursor when you hold your mouse?
[15:13:46] <ciss> hold on a sec
[15:13:49] <FNTom> Blastar, as ciss said jsfiddle or get Firebug for Firefox
[15:17:52] <johnywp> tried visibility hidden and then .attr("style", "visibility:visible"); but it still flickers the unstyled version first
[15:17:53] <johnywp> :S
[15:18:50] <ciss> ryrych: it changes as soon as you move the mouse
[15:19:13] <ryrych> ciss: yes, I know, but in firefox it changes immediately
[15:20:05] <ciss> ryrych: looks like a chrome bug to me
[15:20:39] <ciss> ryrych: btw, may i recommend that you use jsfiddle instead of jsbin? with jsfiddle you don't have to switch between code and render view
[15:20:55] <ciss> johnywp: got a live example?
[15:21:00] <ajpiano> johnywp: just an idea, but why don't you do .css({ opacity: 0, visibility: "visible"})
[15:21:06] <ajpiano> and then fade it in
[15:21:09] <johnywp> let me try it :)
[15:21:17] <ciss> johnywp: use css('visibility', 'visible')
[15:21:21] <johnywp> ciss - no it's local :(
[15:21:23] <johnywp> ok 1 sec
[15:22:54] <ciss> ryrych: take a look at a few jquery ui examples like draggable. see if the bug occurs there too
[15:28:02] <ciss> can someone recommend a text search plugin (no ajax) that allows filtering of matching elements and provides an api or simple ui to step through the results?
[15:28:27] <ciss> i'd hate to implement this myself if there's already a working solution
[15:29:05] <FNTom> Text / textarea or something like autocomplete?
[15:30:00] <ciss> autocomplete is not required. it just needs to search all children of a given element for the search string
[15:30:32] <johnywp> no luck
[15:30:36] <johnywp> still doing the same thing
[15:30:43] <johnywp> flicker and then shows it styled
[15:30:55] <FNTom> ciss, if you're talking about non-editable elements why not use jQuery contains() selector?
[15:31:06] <FNTom> To highlight the text by adding <span>
[15:31:24] <ciss> FNTom: because 1. it doesn't work across multiple elements and 2. i still have to implement it myself
[15:32:23] <ciss> johnywp: consider reordering your stylesheets and javascript in head. what browsers are affected?
[15:32:26] <FNTom> It's actually something I could do with too thinking on it
[15:32:30] <johnywp> just IE
[15:32:42] <ciss> which one?
[15:33:40] <ciss> FNTom: i know that it's not too hard to implement it. still it takes some hours to do that, so a working plugin would be nice
[15:34:27] <FNTom> Would the end result not have to rely on contains() anyway? Just spanning across multiple elements
[15:34:39] <FNTom> Or using wildcards, can't think of a more efficient way to do it off the top of my head
[15:36:28] <FNTom> http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html
[15:36:31] <FNTom> No step-through though
[15:38:35] <ciss> FNTom: seems to work quite fast considering it does a lot of dom operations. thanks for the link
[15:38:36] <johnywp> IE 8
[15:39:14] <FNTom> I think it just iterates through the whole DOM tree and looks to see if the data matches text type then compares
[15:39:16] <ajpiano> ciss: see ?g ba-replaceText jquery
[15:39:18] <bot-t> ciss, jQuery replaceText: String replace for your jQueries! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-replacetext/docs/
[15:39:19] <johnywp> a quick flicker of unstyled... for like a second... and then it works
[15:42:44] <ciss> ajpiano: thanks, a good source to incorporate
[15:43:16] <ajpiano> yeah don't think it's exactly what you need but worth a look for sure
[15:45:12] <ciss> definitely, short, efficient and well documented code is always worth a look :)
[15:46:08] <FNTom> Too many comments!
[15:46:22] <ciss> FNTom: not at all. there's a minified version
[15:46:32] <Logikos_> hi, i'm kinda new to javascript, and very new to jquery, i made a test page here: http://logikostech.com/test.htm to try to use jquery to show/hide a div within a div when the outer div is clicked, and then disapear when the mouse goes out of the outer div which expands arround the inner div
[15:46:39] <ciss> FNTom: there's no such thing as "too many comments"
[15:46:43] <FNTom> I know, I'm kinda bad at comments :(
[15:46:55] <Logikos_> but it disapears even while the mosue is still in the outer div, but over the inner div
[15:47:00] <FNTom> I'm the type that writes code and then thinks "Oh.. no comments" and goes back over the code to add comments
[15:47:02] <Logikos_> where have i gone wrong please?
[15:47:41] <ciss> FNTom: sounds familiar. adding function descriptions has the benefit of structuring your code :)
[15:48:03] <FNTom> Logikos_, the only thing that's not working is that it collapses when the mouse is outside the inner div, not the outer div?
[15:48:13] <FNTom> ciss: Self documenting code ftw.
[15:48:25] <muzone> is there anything better than http://jsbeautifier.org/?
[15:49:08] <Logikos_> FNTom: it collapses when the mouse goes bellow the origional size of the main div, but when the inner div is display:block, and i move my mouse down over the inner div (still within the outer div) it collapses
[15:49:15] <ciss> FNTom: imho javascript is not exactly ideal for self documenting code :)
[15:49:16] <FNTom> muzone: A good IDE will do similar, not sure how you want it better though.
[15:49:25] <Logikos_> i have a .mouseout() on the outer div...
[15:50:21] <FNTom> I could be wrong, but create your mouse-out code inside your click function code
[15:50:31] <ajpiano> muzone: yeah i just have it integrated in my vimz
[15:50:52] <muzone> FNTom: well for pastebins there are pastebin.ca (good) and gist.github.com (bad)
[15:50:55] <FNTom> ciss, that's actually very true. Thought I was chatting in ##php :P
[15:50:58] <muzone> ajpiano: nice
[15:51:23] <Logikos_> FNTom: i'll try that, but i dont see how it would mater....
[15:51:25] <FNTom> muzone; Oh I thought you were talking about formatting JS code (considering the site name, next time be a bit clearer ;)
[15:51:26] <ajpiano> http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2727
[15:51:38] <muzone> FNTom: i was
[15:51:45] <muzone> FNTom: just illustrating the difference between good and bad
[15:51:47] <muzone> oh fuck
[15:51:50] <muzone> wait it was the other way around
[15:51:59] <muzone> gist.github.com (good) and pastebin.ca (bad)
[15:52:01] <muzone> :D
[15:52:12] <ajpiano> lol i think a lot of people would disagree ahahhaa
[15:52:14] <ajpiano> ok phew
[15:52:22] <ajpiano> i was like, janky ass BS vs gist??! wtf
[15:52:30] <FNTom> I let Aptana IDE format my Javascript before I pastebin :P
[15:52:31] <muzone> haha
[15:52:34] <FNTom> So I can't really help there
[15:52:36] <Logikos_> tryed it, it didnt mater
[15:52:48] <muzone> hey thanks for introducing me to the world of vim scripts
[15:53:11] <lecoeur> Hi, how to wish a nice viewing of performance in english(official language)? :)

[15:56:08] <ciss> lecoeur: can you repost that without using google translate? :)
[15:56:33] <muzone> wait that actually sounds kinda cool
[15:57:46] <ciss> it's the last, triumphant breath of a dying man
[15:58:12] <muzone> hahaha
[16:01:01] <FNTom> Logikos_, you there?
[16:02:27] <troubleman> why do the jquery ui tooltips have so many different demos and syntaxes?
[16:02:57] <ciss> because they're versatile?
[16:03:54] <ciss> if they didn't, you would be bragging about why they don't do what you want them to ;)
[16:05:05] <ciss> er, complaining, not bragging
[16:12:09] <realpap> hi
[16:13:04] <realpap> how could i indicate the find selector to find <li>s that dont have <ul>s under it?
[16:14:42] <ciss> realpap: use :not()
[16:15:45] <realpap> im ultra noob to objects
[16:16:26] <realpap> let me see if i can put together the code
[16:17:17] <realpap> $('ul.menu').find("lis that dont have uls").css('background-color', 'red');
[16:17:53] <realpap> that is, i dunno how to write the find line
[16:20:04] <realpap> $('ul.menu').not(ul).css('background-color', 'red'); ?
[16:21:38] <ciss> realpap, hint: :not() is a jquery selector
[16:22:06] <FNTom> Isn't it a jQuery function too, just not in that context?
[16:22:31] <ciss> FNTom: of course, but i cant be used in selectors
[16:22:33] <FNTom> Also you have no quotes around your not(ul)
[16:22:48] <ciss> anyway, the docs suggest using .not() instead: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[16:23:15] <realpap> im on that url
[16:23:24] <realpap> i just dont understand :/
[16:24:10] <ciss> realpap: you're basically doing $('ul.menu').not(elements that *have* ul's).css(...)
[16:24:34] <ciss> er, there's an error in there anyway
[16:24:44] <ciss> $('ul.menu li')
[16:25:31] <nathggns> What would be an easy way to wait until all child elements have loaded?
[16:25:35] <nathggns> (not the whoe page)
[16:25:47] <ciss> realpap: first you select all list items. then you use .not() to strip all those elements that you *don't* want to have in your selection. then you apply your rules
[16:26:23] <realpap> so $(ul.menu li')not('ul').css(...)?
[16:26:34] <ciss> realpap: exactly :)
[16:26:39] <ciss> but your forgot the dot
[16:26:53] <realpap> oh
[16:27:00] <realpap> $(ul.menu li').not('ul').css(...)?
[16:27:04] <ciss> yip
[16:27:17] <realpap> still im not sure if that whats i need leet me try THANKS A LOT IN ADVANCE
[16:27:32] <ciss> go easy on the capslock
[16:27:39] <realpap> sorry
[16:28:18] <nathggns> anyone?
[16:29:46] <realpap> $(ul.menu li').not('ul').addClass("test");
[16:29:56] <realpap> that its what im trying but its not working
[16:30:18] <ciss> realpap: to narrow down a problem, it's always good to dumb down your code (simplify it). jsfiddle.net is a great tool. go to the site, create an example list in the html pane, write your javascript in the bottom html pane, select the jquery library on the left and hit run. if somethings not working you can provide as with the link to a working example that we can tweak
[16:30:46] <ciss> -"bottom html pane" +"bottom javascript pane"
[16:31:08] <ciss> darn... -"as" +"us"
[16:31:11] <ciss> getting late ...
[16:31:37] <ciss> wow, a chainfire of disconnects
[16:35:32] <realpap> ciss
[16:35:41] <realpap> can i explain u what i need?
[16:35:56] <realpap> im on that page but i cant workaround my problem

[16:43:03] <johnywp> i am talking about jquery versions
[16:43:15] <johnywp> can anybody tell what the problem is?
[16:48:18] <troubleman> Is anybody using jQuery UI Tooltip?
[16:48:37] <ciss> realpap: in case you haven't received an answer yet, here are some corrections: http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/
[16:49:40] <realpap> let see
[16:50:18] <realpap> thanks man
[16:50:51] <ciss> take your time to understand the changes i made
[16:51:39] <realpap> yes
[16:53:12] <johnywp> ciss, could you take a look? with 1.5.2 it works, but with anything newer, the selected value is not showing

[17:05:06] <johnywp> ciss: would you please take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/AKPnX/9/ - i am stumped... would really appreciate some help if you can :)
[17:12:39] <nathggns> Is there a way we can check the loaded state of an img?
[17:13:00] <Eviltwin> Like if it is loaded?
[17:13:23] <muzone> Is it possible doing JS in PDF files? Adobe Illustrator has a very tricky and ugly way of generating graphs. If I could just use JS, I could perhaps use gRaphaël: http://g.raphaeljs.com/barchart2.html - what y'all think?
[17:13:31] <Eviltwin> nathggns: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534359(v=vs.85).aspx
[17:13:46] <Eviltwin> muzone: Kind of a security issue if it can
[17:14:30] <muzone> i see
[17:15:24] <realpap> im back
[17:20:04] <realpap> ciss
[17:20:21] <realpap> first think i dont know its the > u added
[17:20:37] <realpap> it works without it but for sure u put it there for something
[17:21:50] <realpap> im reading the has selector docs
[17:27:08] <ciss> realpap: that's a "child selector". it makes sure that only those li elements are selected that are direct children of your ul.menu
[17:28:29] <realpap> ul.menu.li would be the same?
[17:28:48] <ciss> no
[17:28:50] <realpap> ok not
[17:28:53] <Haprog> a dot "." is a classname selector
[17:28:54] <realpap> i just tried it
[17:29:03] <Haprog> > is _direct_ child
[17:29:04] <hsbot>   Not in scope: `is'Not in scope: `_direct_'Not in scope: `child'
[17:29:49] <Haprog> a whitespace is decendant (either direct child or grandchild)
[17:30:32] <Haprog> just basic css selectors
[17:32:57] <realpap> oh now i understand
[17:33:06] <realpap> > applys ONLY for direct child
[17:33:07] <hsbot>   Not in scope: `applys'Not in scope: data constructor `ONLY'Not in scope: `for'Not in scope: `direct'Not in scope: `child'
[17:33:16] <realpap> and whitespace also to grandchild... etc...
[17:34:15] <johnywp> can someone please take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/AKPnX/9/ - i am stumped... would really appreciate some help if you can :) the selected value is not being displayed when using any jQuery version newer than 1.5.2
[17:39:00] <amon293> hi! i'm having trouble here with nested tabs on easytabs. can anyone please help me?
[17:42:24] <amon293> easytabs anyone?
[17:43:07] <Krinkle> > 'test';
[17:43:08] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:3: lexical error in string/character literal at character 'e'
[17:46:26] <Logikos_> hi, i'm kinda new to javascript, and very new to jquery, i made a test page here: http://logikostech.com/test.htm to try to use jquery to show/hide a div within a div when the outer div is clicked, and then disapear when the mouse goes out of the outer div which expands arround the inner div
[17:47:31] <Krinkle> Logikos_: Now it's collapsed by default, expands on click, and repeats on hover
[17:48:22] <Krinkle> Logikos_: The problem is that you are binding inside the click handler
[17:48:29] <Logikos_> default is good, expand is good, but it re colapses when you mouse down to the newly shown text
[17:48:29] <Krinkle> you add a listener every time it is clicked
[17:48:50] <Krinkle> click(function(){ .. }) is called every time a user clicks on it
[17:48:50] <Logikos_> i didnt have it like that at first, someone told me to do that and i tryed it, i'll put it back
[17:48:51] <Krinkle> that's good
[17:49:15] <Krinkle> mouseout(function(){ .. }) is called every time a mouse leaves the element
[17:49:25] <Krinkle> but you're adding a mouseout() every time it's clicked
[17:49:31] <Krinkle> move that outside the click function
[17:49:37] <Logikos_> done
[17:49:58] <Logikos_> i understand your point and agree, i only put it in the other event caus esomeone else told me to... lol
[17:50:04] <Logikos_> the problem is still there however
[17:50:59] <Krinkle> Logikos_: http://jsfiddle.net/aaKdQ/
[17:51:01] <Krinkle> I moved it there
[17:51:18] <Krinkle> That makes it easier to edit :)
[17:52:51] <Krinkle> Logikos_: http://jsfiddle.net/aaKdQ/1/
[17:52:54] <Krinkle> something like that ?
[17:53:39] <Logikos_> yes, not sure why its so wide in that thing but yes
[17:53:46] <Logikos_> ty, now let me read to see what you did lol
[17:55:58] <Krinkle> Logikos_: What about this ? http://jsfiddle.net/aaKdQ/2/
[17:57:55] <Logikos_> thats cool
[17:58:24] <Logikos_> what is .stop(true,true)
[17:58:34] <Eviltwin> ?.stop @ Logikos_
[17:58:35] <bot-t> Logikos_, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[17:58:48] <Krinkle> Logikos_: I added some comments: http://jsfiddle.net/aaKdQ/3/
[17:58:57] <Krinkle>  The stop() call is to avoid an animation queue when some one hovers twice before the first animation is ready.
[17:59:23] <Krinkle> So when you hover your mouse a few times in/out, it should not make more slides. It just kill the one that's happening and start a new silde
[17:59:41] <Krinkle> otherwise you could have a situation where the animation goes on for a long time even when the user doesn't do anything
[18:00:33] <Logikos_> i c, ty
[18:00:34] <Krinkle> Logikos_: Here is an example of why stop() is needed: http://jsfiddle.net/aaKdQ/4/
[18:00:54] <Krinkle> Hover over the box like 5 times in and out. Then watch and see the box continue animating up and down
[18:00:57] <amon293> does anybody here knows easytabs? i need help with something please
[18:01:12] <Krinkle> amon293: Please show an example on jsfiddle
[18:01:30] <Krinkle> Just include that easy tabs plugin and show an example of your problem in there.
[18:02:17] <amon293> Krinkle: i'm trying to do working nested tabs but i can't...
[18:04:55] <amon293> http://jsfiddle.net/Pt2PW/
[18:05:25] <Eviltwin> Oh my God...
[18:05:31] <Eviltwin> That's some ugly code
[18:06:33] <amon293> Eviltwin: is that about my code?
[18:06:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:07:12] <amon293> i know... i didn't wrote it... i'm working on a pre made template
[18:07:59] <amon293> i'm trying to clean the page and the code but i'm lacking some knowledge on javascript
[18:08:24] <amon293> please visit http://www.ecosta.pt/site.html for more information about the website
[18:08:33] <amon293> what i'm trying to do
[18:08:45] <Eviltwin> I reformatted it: http://jsfiddle.net/Pt2PW/1/
[18:08:50] <Eviltwin> This will help debugging significantly
[18:09:41] <Eviltwin> And switched it to jQuery... http://jsfiddle.net/Pt2PW/2/
[18:10:04] <amon293> is to make the nested tabs under the page about ecosta to work properly
[18:11:06] <Eviltwin> I only see one tab content...
[18:11:30] <amon293> please visit http://www.ecosta.pt/site.html for more information about the website
[18:11:51] <amon293> as you can see, there is a tab "about ecosta" with nested tabs
[18:12:06] <amon293> those are the tabs that doesn't work properly
[18:14:03] <amon293> do you see what i mean?
[18:15:02] <Eviltwin> Like I said, I see *ONE* tab
[18:15:07] <Eviltwin> Curabitur cursus arcu in augue aliquam quis ullamcorper neque pellentesque. Nulla in mauris at tortor feugiat bibendum.

[18:16:58] <Guevara> Hello! I have a list and pagination in second tab, clicking in "proximo"(next page) jquery back to the firs tab. Why? =/ print http://postimage.org/image/1682p0kjo/ code: http://dpaste.com/620341/
[18:17:20] <bapi_> what's the best way of retrieving the html data from a span? (<span class="number">10</span> )
[18:17:24] <bapi_> I want to retreieve 10
[18:17:36] <coldhead> ?text @ bapi_
[18:17:36] <bot-t> bapi_, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[18:17:49] <coldhead> or html()
[18:18:55] <amon293> Eviltwin: did you visit http://www.ecosta.pt/site.html ?
[18:21:02] <bapi_> ?val
[18:21:02] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[18:21:11] <bapi_> ?html
[18:21:11] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[18:21:21] <bapi_> ok thanks
[18:22:33] <Eviltwin> amon293: I think I have an idea
[18:23:13] <Eviltwin> Actually that's probably not it
[18:23:34] <amon293> Eviltwin: you visit the site and click the tab about ecosta and see the nested tabs below it right?
[18:27:11] <Eviltwin> Dude
[18:27:16] <Eviltwin> You are reusing ids all over the place
[18:27:23] <coldhead> lol
[18:27:51] <amon293> you mean "tabs" on the ul lists?
[18:28:29] <Eviltwin> Two elements with id aboutmenu
[18:28:52] <Eviltwin> 4 with sales, salesmore, salesmore-hide, and salesmore-show
[18:29:25] <poincare101> Whoa. Jquery is pretty dang popular.
[18:30:07] <amon293> wait, but in sales, that works fine. it's just for the read more & less links
[18:30:20] <amon293> my problem is with tabs
[18:30:39] <amon293> when i click in mission, the tab don't go to mission
[18:30:42] <Eviltwin> amon293: This may be causing your problem
[18:30:49] <Eviltwin> Fix this issue wit the aboutmenu
[18:30:52] <Eviltwin> At least
[18:30:55] <amon293> ok
[18:30:59] <amon293> what do you suggest?
[18:31:13] <amon293> aboutmenu and aboutmenu2 for example?
[18:31:17] <Eviltwin> Not reusing IDs since they can only exist once in a given document
[18:31:20] <poincare101> What does jquery use as  code hosting/bug tracker? AKA where do I submti pull requests?
[18:31:23] <Eviltwin> What you use is completely up to you
[18:31:34] <Eviltwin> poincare101: I believe jQuery is Git-hosted
[18:31:35] <coldhead> github, poincare101
[18:32:09] <bapi_> If I retrieve a numeric value from a div for example $n = $('number').text();
[18:32:21] <bapi_> How can I convert the var n to a number
[18:32:29] <bapi_> $n should be "var n"
[18:32:30] <amon293> Eviltwin: i've changed to aboutmenu and aboutmenu2 and did nothing
[18:32:43] <Eviltwin> bapi_: parseInt if it's an integer, parseFloat if it's decimal
[18:33:07] <poincare101> Eviltwin: thank you.
[18:33:13] <poincare101> coldhead: thanks.

[18:35:11] <coldhead> is anyone listening to anything good?
[18:39:15] <Eviltwin> amon293: I'm still reading source
[18:40:21] <Eviltwin> amon293: I see this $('#aboutmenu').easyTabs({tabs: 'ul#aboutmenu2> li' });
[18:40:31] <Eviltwin> As far as I can tell, the tabs parameter doesn't get used for anything
[18:40:38] <Moridine> coldhead: there's a damn owl that keeps cooing outside my window
[18:40:54] <Moridine> very distracting, I wouldn't recommend it at all
[18:41:22] <amon293> the tabs is used in ul class=tabs
[18:41:28] <stilzinsk> hello. i'm developing a plugin that needs to move elements around the page in absolute coordinates, using css transforms in this case. my current design is to reposition the elements fixed at 0, 0 and translate from there. is there some jquery magic i'm overseeing that would make this easier?
[18:41:56] <amon293> what am i doing wrong? i don't understand...
[18:46:28] <Eviltwin> Oh, duh
[18:46:30] <Eviltwin> Oh not
[18:46:32] <Eviltwin> Or not*
[18:48:26] <amon293> i'm new at jquery and this easytabs thing... sorry... but i want to learn. what am i doing wrong?
[18:49:32] <Eviltwin> Okay, I can see what's happening
[18:53:26] <amon293> what?
[18:53:38] <slavka`> hey guys, having this strange issue where i am adding jquery ui buttons to the page and the icons on them dont show up... if i click on editcss from webdeveloper plugin the icons show up, the css code shown in the edit css view is identical to the one i am editing in the my editor... is it possible that i am adding those buttons before the css has finished loading and thats why the button icons dont show up?
[18:54:12] <Eviltwin> amon293: I know what's happening but not why it's happening
[18:54:18] <Eviltwin> Did you read the easytabs.js source?
[18:54:34] <amon293> yes, but i don't quite get it
[18:54:39] <amon293> if you read it
[18:54:58] <amon293> you'll see that i've tried to create a exactly new function with a new id
[18:55:12] <amon293> but that didn't do nothing
[18:55:23] <Eviltwin> You see the .click() towards the end?
[18:56:22] <amon293> yeah
[18:56:28] <Eviltwin> That's binding a click listener
[18:56:49] <Eviltwin> Now click listeners are supposed to be fired in order from most specific to least specific
[18:57:02] <Eviltwin> i.e. it should be called for the element itself all the way up to the body
[18:57:11] <Eviltwin> then all the way up*
[18:57:33] <Moridine> I never knew that
[18:58:18] <amon293> so, i should change the substr to (2);??
[18:58:56] <Eviltwin> No...
[18:59:00] <Eviltwin> Why would you do that?
[18:59:40] <Eviltwin> Oh shit
[18:59:46] <Eviltwin> No wonder why
[18:59:50] <Eviltwin> It's binding straight to the LI's
[18:59:56] <Eviltwin> It's a bug in the implementation of easytabs
[19:00:15] <Eviltwin> Quick fix should work
[19:00:16] <Moridine> uneasytabs >:[
[19:00:21] <coldhead> IN YOUR FACE, EASYTABS!
[19:00:26] <Eviltwin> Move the $('#aboutmenu').easyTabs above $('#container').easyTabs
[19:00:26] <amon293> lol
[19:00:29] <coldhead> NOW WHO IS EASY
[19:01:02] <Eviltwin> Also all of those $(document).ready(function() { can be combined
[19:01:59] <Eviltwin> Did you make that fix?
[19:02:02] <amon293> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rdNw6/
[19:02:16] <coldhead> $(document).ready(...).ready(...).ready(...)
[19:02:23] <amon293> i add the other menu's
[19:02:25] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/rdNw6/1/
[19:02:35] <amon293> the original menu was the #container
[19:02:37] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Stop trolling the newbs
[19:02:54] <Eviltwin> amon293: Listeners are fired in the order they are bound
[19:03:07] <Eviltwin> All of the li's in #container are getting bound first
[19:03:12] <Eviltwin> Then all the ones in #aboutmenu
[19:03:20] <Eviltwin> So #aboutmenu is winning
[19:03:39] <Eviltwin> Have you ever coded JavaScript before?
[19:04:20] <amon293> so, this tell's to the browser, first look for the tabs in the #menu3 if that menu doesn't exist's try #menu2, if not go to #menu1?? something like that?
[19:04:36] <amon293> Eviltwin: what do you think? :D
[19:05:26] <Eviltwin> This may actually be impossible without changing easytabs.js
[19:05:28] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[19:06:11] <amon293> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rdNw6/2/
[19:06:45] <Eviltwin> Looks right to me
[19:06:52] <amon293> let's try
[19:06:55] <Eviltwin> However it still may not fix it
[19:07:04] <Eviltwin> Since they're bound separately
[19:07:13] <Eviltwin> I don
[19:07:21] <Eviltwin> 't think the normal UI tabs have this problem
[19:07:28] <amon293> no....
[19:07:40] <coldhead> who are the real easy tabs, easytabs
[19:08:08] <Moridine> sleasytabs
[19:08:12] <amon293> can't we add another class to easytabs.js like tabs2?
[19:08:18] <Moridine> okay 20 hours of coding... god damn evil clients
[19:08:29] <Simone> Hello!
[19:08:29] <Eviltwin> amon293: Have you ever written JavaScript before?
[19:08:35] <amon293> no
[19:08:51] <amon293> i'm trying to learn by doing
[19:08:52] <Eviltwin> Have you written CSS selectors before?
[19:08:53] <amon293> :D
[19:09:07] <Simone> In JQUERY, how do you get the details of a file that has been posted via HTML input type="file"?
[19:09:08] <amon293> css selectors yes
[19:09:24] <Eviltwin> Simone: It's actually not allowed by most clients
[19:09:43] <Simone> awww
[19:10:04] <Eviltwin> amon293: What is #container .tabs li ?
[19:10:14] <Simone> well if I am doing some file handling, and I want to use $.ajax ({ blah blah blah how can I pass my file data into the data:
[19:10:35] <Eviltwin> Simone: That's a security risk
[19:10:38] <Eviltwin> Simone: So it's not possible
[19:10:41] <Moridine> Simone: do you mean how can you upload the file via ajax?
[19:11:01] <Simone> well i understand the upload of the file via ajax
[19:11:16] <Simone> I just don't understand how the script will know which file I am referring to if I am doing multiple files
[19:11:33] <Simone> I figure I should be able to do a for loop
[19:11:34] <Eviltwin> amon293: Do you understand the selector #container .tabs li?
[19:11:41] <Simone> But that will require me to have all the file data
[19:11:47] <amon293> Eviltwin: yes
[19:11:53] <amon293> what do you want to know
[19:11:56] <Eviltwin> What about #aboutmenu .tabs li
[19:11:56] <Simone> and I don't understand how to pass form file data into the ajax statement
[19:12:05] <Moridine> Simone: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[19:12:12] <Moridine> not sure if that is useful for you, I found it very useful
[19:12:24] <amon293> i've created aboutmenu
[19:12:50] <Eviltwin> amon293: Those are the selectors the tabs are using internally
[19:12:51] <Simone> been there.
[19:12:53] <amon293> i was trying to replicate the original tab menu
[19:12:55] <Eviltwin> They're waiting for clicks on those elements
[19:13:09] <Eviltwin> The problem with nested tabs
[19:13:17] <Simone> I have such a specific task at hand that i must pull from several different resources
[19:13:22] <Eviltwin> Is that #container .tabs li also matches the elements in #aboutmenu .tabs li
[19:13:39] <Eviltwin> So when you're clicking the subtabs, it's triggering logic in the parent tabs
[19:13:41] <amon293> ok. so, were do i change this elements?
[19:14:49] <Simone> In short, if I have an input type="file" name"whocares"
[19:15:04] <Simone> in php I could use the $FILES[] to get all the information
[19:15:17] <Simone> $_FILES[]['name']
[19:15:20] <Simone> etc.
[19:15:30] <Simone> I thought there was something like that in JS or JQUERY
[19:15:33] <Simone> where it would be
[19:15:36] <Simone> file.name instead
[19:15:50] <Simone> file of course being the object
[19:15:53] <amon293> Eviltwin: ok. so, were do i change this elements?
[19:16:22] <Eviltwin> You see references to $(thisId+" .tabs... ?
[19:16:34] <Eviltwin> Try replacing those with $(thisId+">.tabs
[19:16:54] <Eviltwin> Instead of any successor, the immediate child
[19:17:26] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[19:17:29] <Eviltwin> Do you understand why?
[19:18:26] <amon293> this changes on easytabs.js right?
[19:18:29] <Eviltwin> Yep
[19:18:35] <amon293> one sec please
[19:19:03] <nathggns> I have a wrap (content wrap) which the only styling it has is position:relative; I'm using it to calculate the natural size of everything within it. My problem is, is that it will only become taller than the parent div, not thicker, screenshot - http://s.nath.is/25_09_11_03_18_59.png
[19:19:15] <Eviltwin> You can literally find and replace
[19:19:19] <nathggns> Anyone have any idea?
[19:19:24] <amon293> what do you mean with any sucessor? the imediate child?
[19:19:45] <slavka`> can anyone shed some light on this... having this strange issue where i am adding jquery ui buttons to the page and the icons on them dont show up... if i click on editcss from webdeveloper plugin the icons show up, the css code shown in the edit css view is identical to the one i am editing in the my editor... is it possible that i am adding those buttons before the css has finished loading and thats why the button icons dont show up?
[19:19:48] <Eviltwin> Do you know the difference between .a .b and .a > .b ?
[19:20:00] <slavka`> weirdest thing eva!
[19:20:05] <nathggns> any successor means any child, so parent>child>child would work. with immediate, parent>child>child doesnt
[19:20:27] <Eviltwin> nathggns: That's needlessly misleading with the >'s in there :P
[19:20:47] <nathggns> lol Eviltwin, i was just trying to represent a hierachy
[19:21:25] <nathggns> my problem is really confusing :(
[19:21:37] <Eviltwin> nathggns: What's your problem?
[19:21:47] <nathggns> I have a wrap (content wrap) which the only styling it has is position:relative; I'm using it to calculate the natural size of everything within it. My problem is, is that it will only become taller than the parent div, not thicker, screenshot - http://s.nath.is/25_09_11_03_18_59.png
[19:22:00] <nathggns> wider*
[19:22:03] <Eviltwin> Do you have a CSS reset?
[19:22:16] <nathggns> no
[19:22:20] <Eviltwin> Start with that
[19:22:28] <nathggns> I can't, this is for a jquery plugin
[19:22:29] <Eviltwin> Browsers have sucky built-in stylesheets
[19:22:38] <nathggns> can't effect anything but the element
[19:22:49] <nathggns> if I have a css reset added in, it will affect the whole page
[19:22:53] <Eviltwin> Okay, find a CSS reset, and replicate the logic for that element
[19:23:02] <Eviltwin> Via .css
[19:23:11] <slavka`> Eviltwin:  you seem like a bright spark :) maybe you can work out why the background images only show up when i have the editcss panel open
[19:23:20] <slavka`> on firefox
[19:23:32] <slavka`> if i close the panel.. background images dissapear
[19:23:39] <amon293> Eviltwin: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rdNw6/3/
[19:23:58] <slavka`> more specifically the icons
[19:24:04] <compufreak> slavka`: think?
[19:24:07] <compufreak> whoops, link
[19:24:10] <compufreak> getting tired -.-

[19:28:28] <Simone> So there is no way to get all the information of a file and store it in some javascript variable? to be accessible through dot association (i.e. file.name)??
[19:28:32] <amon293> Eviltwin: it seems it worked!
[19:28:40] <amon293> thanks a lot
[19:29:10] <slavka`> compufreak: one sec...

[19:56:51] <whomp> im having some troubles with this site
[19:57:01] <whomp> it doesnt seem to be doing anything in the onLoad block- http://www.freshnewtracks.com/feedback/
[19:58:23] <nathggns> onload *
[19:58:32] <nathggns> js = case sensitive
[19:58:54] <coldhead> and jQuery is just plain sensitive
[19:59:01] <coldhead> sensitive to people using onload and onclick
[19:59:06] <coldhead> like it's still the motherfucking 90s
[19:59:19] <coldhead> don't do that!
[19:59:23] <nathggns> an eww obtrusive js
[20:00:25] <whomp> so its onClick?
[20:02:19] <coldhead> ?click @ whomp
[20:02:19] <bot-t> whomp, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[20:02:22] <coldhead> it's that ^^
[20:05:38] <whomp> what i also want to do is pass in two strings to the function, for a number of items calling the same function
[20:06:16] <whomp> would i need to make a separate instance of the same method for every single item
[20:06:17] <whomp> ?
[20:58:41] <AliG1000> I playing with http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/.  I'm trying to make an input for store hours.  For example, you open from 8 til 5 but shut at lunch, you just select those hours.
[20:58:45] <patrick99e99> exit
[20:58:54] <AliG1000> I'm having a couple of problems:
[21:00:29] <AliG1000> 1) I want to store the results in a database.  Of course when you open the page back up again to edit the hours, I want the previous hours to show
[21:00:38] <AliG1000> what's the best way to do this?
[21:01:57] <coldhead> maybe with ajax?
[21:01:59] <AliG1000> also, if I select #2, #3, #4 for example, I want to display the text, "7am-9am" rather than #2, #3, #4 - what is the best way to do this?
[21:02:35] <AliG1000> @goldhead  go on
[21:02:53] <coldhead> you could have an ajax method that sends the hours to the server
[21:03:01] <coldhead> and another that retrieves the stored hours
[21:03:12] <coldhead> and have the page request those hours when it is first opened
[21:03:29] <coldhead> but it's a matter for yourself how you store that in the db
[21:03:36] <coldhead> the 2nd problem is hard
[21:03:41] <coldhead> contiguity
[21:03:48] <AliG1000> e.g. within an option select, I can input 'selected' into the drop-down box.  But I don't know how to do it with the <li> elements
[21:04:04] <coldhead> what <li> elements?
[21:04:16] <coldhead> you might wanna paste a working demo at jsfiddle
[21:04:22] <coldhead> ?p
[21:04:22] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:04:36] <AliG1000> if you look at http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/, Item1, Item2 are all <li> elements
[21:05:09] <AliG1000> e.g.      <li class="ui-widget-content">Item 1</li>
[21:05:17] <coldhead> http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#serialize
[21:05:24] <coldhead> look at the view source link there
[21:05:28] <coldhead> see how that does it
[21:06:14] <AliG1000> yes, I'm using the serialize one so that I can capture the events and then send them to the server later
[21:06:38] <coldhead> that sounds good
[21:07:35] <AliG1000> what I am having trouble with:  say I select the hours from 7-9.  and then save them.  when I open the page back up again, I don't want a blank set of hours again - I want the hours that I saved to show up again
[21:09:01] <coldhead> and that is what i am saying you can retrieve via ajax
[21:09:51] <AliG1000> how?
[21:10:08] <coldhead> it depends how you've stored them
[21:10:12] <nathggns> Can you guys look at http://pastebin.com/axEL0fwh - when methods.move is called with the X axis, nothing happens, as in, the css doesn't change
[21:10:21] <nathggns> ive tried calling it manually via the console
[21:10:23] <coldhead> assume the server sends back a list of hours that it's open for
[21:10:31] <coldhead> "9,10,11"
[21:10:37] <nathggns> the code is ran, ive tested with console.log
[21:11:17] <coldhead> your code could say "give me the hours pls" then split() on ',' to get each hour and then it would select the 9th, 10th and 11th <li>s andgive them the class "iassureyouweareopen"
[21:12:17] <AliG1000> so  on the onLoad event?
[21:13:03] <coldhead> ?ready @ AliG1000
[21:13:03] <bot-t> AliG1000, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[21:13:16] <coldhead> that happens sooner than onLoad
[21:13:19] <AliG1000> of course
[21:14:28] <nathggns> Does no one see why?
[21:15:55] <nathggns> oh nvm
[21:15:58] <AliG1000> my second question - on converting #2, #3, #4 to show 7-9am... I can probably get away without showing that live - the select boxes do that anyway
[21:17:22] <AliG1000> I mean, the selectable boxes merely show it in graphic form.  I can output the 7-9 using some PHP coding - it has to appear on a different page anyway.
[21:19:26] <AliG1000> I'll play with the Options, Events and Methods that jQuery provide for the Selectable widget to see if I can get ajax to pre-select the hours
[21:23:26] <coldhead> AliG1000: if you get stuck, put a live demo up somewhere
[21:23:29] <coldhead> and link to it here
[21:23:36] <coldhead> for best results
[21:26:01] <AliG1000> here it is so far http://pastie.org/2587409  I've just played with the css and laid the time-slots out
[21:35:22] <realpap> i want to animate the rollovers in this menu http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/1/ should i use slideUp/SlideDown ?
[21:39:34] <nathggns> $(ele).height() is returning 0
[21:41:47] <coldhead> ?slidetoggle @ realpap
[21:41:47] <bot-t> realpap, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[21:42:09] <coldhead> nathggns: that means the ele doesn't exist OR it's not visible for some reason
[21:42:12] <coldhead> so it can't be calculated
[21:42:55] <realpap> i tried slidetoggle
[21:42:57] <realpap> but
[21:43:06] <realpap> i couldnt get it done right
[21:43:12] <coldhead> oh no :(
[21:43:14] <coldhead> programming is hard
[21:43:25] <realpap> ill try again
[21:43:36] <nathggns>  hm
[21:46:06] <sequencers> Can anyone point me to a command, or reference on a how to :
[21:46:25] <Eviltwin> How to colon?
[21:46:30] <sequencers>  how to use jQuery to process a user input, with a ruby method, which is in a module in the library, not an Active Record method.
[21:46:34] <sequencers> thank you.
[21:47:21] <sequencers> i know ajax should be able to do it, but .. i have been unable to make it work.
[21:47:35] <Eviltwin> What does the Ruby URL need?
[21:47:58] <sequencers> the 'action', and the input serialized, which i can do that part.
[21:48:41] <Eviltwin> Can you give an example?
[21:48:50] <sequencers> i can serialize the input, but .. i have never been able to get the ajax({ url: to be found.
[21:48:58] <sequencers> yes, .. hold on thank you
[21:49:48] <sequencers> var lexigrams = $j.ajax({ url: "http://localhost:3000/lib/lexigram_sequenced", type: "GET", action: 'lexigram_sequenced', data: $j('data-remote#sequencetext').serialize()}).responseText;
[21:50:43] <Eviltwin> There's no "action" param to jQuery.ajax
[21:50:47] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[21:51:10] <sequencers> Eviltwin, please forgive .. i have a thousand variations of this and that was a very wrong one.
[21:51:11] <realpap> i made this but its buggy, any help ? http://jsfiddle.net/PA87B/
[21:52:04] <sequencers> var lexigrams = $j.ajax({ url: "http://localhost:3000/app/helpers/lexigram.rb", type: "GET", data: $j('input#sequenceEntry').serialize()}).responseText;
[21:52:17] <sequencers> there, i placed it in the helpers directory.
[21:53:43] <Eviltwin> Have you ever done asynchronous programming before?
[21:53:58] <nathggns> done - http://jsfiddle.net/PA87B/2/
[21:54:21] <sequencers> NO, and .. please know i am an autodidact, with no formal training ..
[21:54:34] <nathggns> first time ive ever come accross code in spanish
[21:55:03] <sequencers> i have a mountain of jQuery working, and the ajax usage to run a Ruby method has stumped me.
[21:55:52] <Eviltwin> realpap: Your :hover's in your CSS are fighting with your jQuery animations
[21:55:57] <sequencers> i have tried .getScript, and same thing .. i cannot get the method found and processed.
[21:56:12] <realpap> yes
[21:56:23] <Eviltwin> sequencers: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[21:56:26] <sequencers> i also cannot find any examples of this in the wild ...
[21:56:29] <sequencers> sweet, thank you.
[21:56:36] <realpap> btw thanks nathggns
[21:57:04] <Eviltwin> realpap: You need to remove the :hover display changes from the CSS
[21:58:30] <realpap> i just tried and the dropdown stopped working
[21:58:38] <sequencers> Eviltwin, what do i do with that ? use it as a template to write my method ? or .. use it to show you my codes ?
[21:58:50] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:58:57] <sequencers> If you want me to post the codes there, i have to join ... i guess
[21:59:07] <Eviltwin> It's an example of asynchronous programming
[21:59:12] <sequencers> ok
[21:59:17] <Eviltwin> Read all the comments and stuff
[21:59:36] <Eviltwin> Rather than a function call returning the result, asynchronous programming uses the notion of a callback function
[21:59:37] <sequencers> okay ..
[21:59:49] <Eviltwin> A function that will be sent the result when the result is ready
[21:59:55] <sequencers> yes
[22:00:18] <Eviltwin> $.ajax is asynchronous
[22:00:42] <Eviltwin> The first A stands for asynchronous
[22:00:55] <sequencers> unless set to async: set to false
[22:01:10] <Eviltwin> Which you didn't do
[22:01:16] <Eviltwin> But it's also bad practice
[22:01:25] <sequencers> which .. i thought is best to do per what i have read as it keeps the flow on this one odd method going
[22:02:07] <sequencers> okay .. i will study this link, thank you.
[22:02:07] <Eviltwin> What have you read about this?
[22:02:26] <Eviltwin> Anyone who advocates synchronous AJAX is an idiot
[22:02:26] <sequencers> several newer book, at jQuery 1.4 level,
[22:03:03] <sequencers> the think ajax book, which .. with all the changes up to 1.6 has kept me somewhat confused ... on this one issue.
[22:03:14] <sequencers> everything else i LOVE about jquery. wow
[22:03:28] <Eviltwin> Which one issue?
[22:04:24] <sequencers> ajax, the definitive guide, by anthony t. holdener III     957 pages
[22:04:32] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[22:04:37] <Eviltwin> Why the hell did you get that?
[22:04:45] <sequencers> bookstore ..
[22:04:48] <sequencers> smile ..
[22:05:15] <Eviltwin> Everything you need to know to use AJAX can be summed up in like 2 pages
[22:05:22] <sequencers> also, jQuery in Action, by Bear Bibeault and Yehuda Katz, 2nd edition
[22:05:30] <sequencers> where are those two pages ?
[22:05:41] <sequencers> and .. does it include how to run a ruby method in the mix ?
[22:05:45] <sequencers> grin ..
[22:05:53] <Eviltwin> How do "run a ruby method"?
[22:06:00] <Eviltwin> I don't think you understand web programming
[22:06:18] <sequencers> ya know ... there might be a better way to attack this problem.
[22:06:49] <sequencers> if the .merge() method could do a comparison of the items in the merge, and their values, that would do what i need to do.
[22:07:06] <sequencers> but .. best i can tell, the jquery .merge() just merges, with no comparison.
[22:07:26] <Eviltwin> Are you a native english speaker?
[22:07:52] <sequencers> run a Ruby method .. i say it that way i have four other jquery methods doing their thing, processings wise, with the user input, but those do it with pure javascript.
[22:07:57] <sequencers> yes.
[22:08:02] <sequencers> i an a native Englisher.
[22:08:05] <sequencers> smile ..
[22:09:11] <Eviltwin> Are you planning to use AJAX to have the server merge two arrays instead of doing it in the browser?
[22:10:36] <sequencers> no ...
[22:11:23] <sequencers> Eviltwin, this next is a pure Ruby method, and does the trick.  If i could accomplish the same with the use of the merge in jQuery, that would work.
[22:11:24] <Eviltwin> Please attempt to explain what you mean by "run a Ruby method"
[22:11:32] <sequencers> @lexigram_hash1 = @keys_values1.merge(@keys_values2) do | key, first, second | (first > second)? first : second end unless nil
[22:11:41] <sequencers> see how the values are compared ..
[22:12:21] <sequencers> however, that is part of a Ruby method that is 30+ lines long.
[22:12:22] <Eviltwin> I don't know what that does
[22:12:27] <sequencers> okay ...
[22:12:32] <Eviltwin> Can you explain it?
[22:12:41] <danieliser> im loading images in a modal by just adding an img tag with a src.. Any way to cache the images in case they get loaded again?
[22:12:43] <sequencers> yes, i am pondering how to do so succintly.
[22:13:07] <sequencers> i will find my example, hold on a minnie please
[22:13:21] <Eviltwin> Can you please try to speak proper English?
[22:13:28] <Eviltwin> This is testing my patience
[22:13:36] <sequencers> minnie is minute, please forgive.
[22:13:38] <sequencers>   def lexigram_sequenced
[22:13:39] <sequencers>     @lexigram_sequenced = lexigram_sequencer(@sequencetext)
[22:13:39] <sequencers>   end
[22:13:43] <sequencers> that is a ruby method.
[22:13:48] <Eviltwin> I understand that much
[22:13:54] <sequencers> okay.
[22:14:35] <sequencers> i need to be able to call that method, on the user entry, which is picked up by jquery.
[22:15:02] <Eviltwin> So you're saying that within JavaScrupt, you need to run Ruby?
[22:15:06] <sequencers> i will study the link you gave me. ..
[22:15:08] <sequencers> YES
[22:15:10] <sequencers> that is it.
[22:15:16] <Eviltwin> That's not possible
[22:15:24] * FNTom holds up a door for Eviltwin.
[22:15:24] <sequencers> Wow
[22:15:31] <Eviltwin> JavaScript runs in the browser
[22:15:35] <Eviltwin> On the client side
[22:15:41] <Eviltwin> Ruby runs on the server
[22:15:47] <sequencers> ajax can go run a script ..
[22:15:53] <coldhead> coffeescript runs in the browser
[22:15:59] <coldhead> and it's like ruby
[22:16:11] <Eviltwin> AJAX can send data to a URL in a limited capacity
[22:16:13] <Eviltwin> And receive it
[22:16:24] <FNTom> sequencers, you can send your values to your server, have ruby do what you want and return it sure.
[22:16:26] <sequencers> coldhead, does that mean, to run a Ruby method, i should learn Coffescript.
[22:16:31] <Eviltwin> If you don't know how to make that work Ruby side, you should talk to #ruby
[22:17:27] <FNTom> sequencers; http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[22:17:36] <sequencers> FNTom : how can i  send user input value to our server, and have Ruby process that data, and return a new value, and this is not involved with the MODEL.
[22:18:03] <sequencers> THANK YOU
[22:18:39] <sequencers> I HAVE NOT studied this link, because, i am not getting JSON data.
[22:19:18] <Eviltwin> sequencers: AJAX sends and receives data to/from a particular URL
[22:19:38] <sequencers> I am sending the Ruby Method a key/value pair with .serialize() , and getting back a string of text, after the Ruby method processes the value.
[22:19:48] <FNTom> sequencers; Ruby likes JSON as does Javascript - seems ideal.
[22:19:56] <Eviltwin> sequencers: If you don't know what data the URL needs to receive, then we can't help you
[22:20:00] <Danny_Joris> Hi all, I'm trying to figure this out: http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/vm7qP/6/ Issue is in the info tab.
[22:20:09] <sequencers> Eviltwin, yes, and at that url is an action that calls itself, and should run, I thought.
[22:20:25] <danieliser> im loading images in a modal by just adding an img tag with a src.. Any way to cache the images in case they get loaded again?
[22:20:32] <Danny_Joris> it's based on this navigation: http://dorchester.dannyjoris.ca/
[22:20:32] <sequencers> I do know what the url needs to receive, the key/value pair.
[22:20:40] <Eviltwin> danieliser: Images are automatically cached by the browser
[22:20:58] <Danny_Joris> so if I press down, I want the 'active' state (light grey) to stay until the page refreshes
[22:20:59] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Does this use POST? GET?
[22:21:02] <FNTom> Danny_Joris; I don't see an info tab on that jsfiddle link?
[22:21:23] <Danny_Joris> FNTom: in the left sidebar?
[22:21:31] <Danny_Joris> under Add resources?
[22:21:34] <danieliser> Eviltwin: you know what lol.. had firebug set to disable cache.. doh
[22:21:47] <FNTom> Oh, gotcha
[22:21:57] <nathggns> After minifying my script i get unexpected identifier
[22:22:19] <Eviltwin> Danny_Joris: You shouldn't bind new event listeners within an event listener
[22:22:26] <sequencers> FNTom, it should be a POST, i believe, tho i have tried both ways.  the problem is this does not involved the ACTIVE RECORD resources, no database call, just run a processing on the value of the key/value pair, and return the result.
[22:22:42] <Danny_Joris> Eviltwin: that might be a good start
[22:22:48] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Get your Ruby working first
[22:22:52] <Danny_Joris> Eviltwin: had no idea if this was OK or not
[22:22:54] <Eviltwin> Test it using cURL or wget or something
[22:23:03] <sequencers> okay ..
[22:23:21] <Eviltwin> Danny_Joris: Every time there's a mousedown, you're adding a new event listener
[22:23:21] <sequencers> i do have my Ruby working, the methods i am calling work like a charm in console and on the browser.
[22:24:14] <sequencers> the one thing i cannot fathom yet how to do is run a ruby method with ajax making the call to the method and getting the result.
[22:24:18] <nathggns> anyone know why i would get unexpected identifiers in minified js?
[22:24:29] <sequencers> i will study the links you and Eviltwin gave me ..
[22:24:32] <sequencers> Thank you.
[22:25:14] <FNTom> Danny_Joris: Your logic is a bit all over the place. Can you type it like this please? I want X to happen if mouse out while mouse down. I want Y to happen if mouse out while mouse down.
[22:25:27] <FNTom> It's late!
[22:27:50] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Change this HTML to make it such that clicking the "Go" button will do what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/nzxyq/
[22:28:05] <sequencers> hold on ...
[22:29:38] <Eviltwin> What I want you to do is construct the request that makes your ruby thing fire
[22:29:41] <Eviltwin> An example
[22:29:47] <sequencers> okay
[22:30:03] <sequencers> yes .. thank you, so sorry i am so slow
[22:30:29] <Eviltwin> Fill it out, press update
[22:30:38] <Eviltwin> Then press Go
[22:31:11] <sequencers> EvilTwin .. are you good on me showing it in haml ?
[22:31:18] <sequencers> i have a widget with the input form in haml
[22:31:52] <coldhead> mark haml?
[22:31:57] <Eviltwin> No, I will read HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
[22:31:58] <Eviltwin> Nothing else
[22:32:06] <sequencers> okay ...
[22:34:28] <Danny_Joris> FNTom: this works: http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/vm7qP/8/
[22:34:33] <Danny_Joris> FNTom: but is the code OK?
[22:34:38] <sequencers> i pressed go, and got back an error 404
[22:34:57] <Danny_Joris> FNTom: I based it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1572483/jquery-mousedown-mousemove
[22:35:13] <Danny_Joris> loosely
[22:35:19] <Danny_Joris> the click variable
[22:35:38] <Eviltwin> Danny_Joris: jQuery.event.global.click is true when the mouse is down and false when it is up
[22:35:41] <Eviltwin> Particularly useful
[22:35:44] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Then you did it wrong
[22:35:52] <sequencers> hmmm ...
[22:36:00] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Did you hit update?
[22:36:05] <Eviltwin> At the top?
[22:36:24] <FNTom> Danny_Joris, apart from Eviltwins suggestion, it looks fine :P
[22:36:27] <sequencers> no. just go.  redoing it now.
[22:36:59] <Danny_Joris> FNTom, Eviltwin  ... thanks guys. I gotta look up this global event click thing.
[22:40:40] <sequencers> Eviltwin, i pressed Go and it looks good.
[22:41:17] <sequencers> that's just the input, tho.
[22:41:56] <Eviltwin> You know action is a URL, right?
[22:42:07] <Eviltwin> The point was to get example data
[22:42:08] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[22:42:22] <sequencers> yes ..
[22:42:56] <Eviltwin> Do you have a webserver?
[22:43:04] <Eviltwin> A live, running webserver right now
[22:43:09] <Eviltwin> That you're setting this up on?
[22:43:11] <sequencers> i do.
[22:43:16] <sequencers> i do.
[22:43:23] <sequencers> and i am a member of git ...
[22:43:39] <sequencers> tho, i have not pushed this particular problem up there yet .. hoping to solve it first.
[22:43:47] <Eviltwin> I'd like you to fill in that form so that it actually makes a good example request to your actual running code
[22:43:57] <Eviltwin> With an actual good response
[22:44:03] <sequencers> i do not have this on a live website, on the net.  my server is on my computer.
[22:44:05] <Danny_Joris> Eviltwin: thanks for that tip. I think not going to use it though, because I want to prevent the 'active' state from being removed even if there has been a mouseup again and moved out the element.
[22:44:18] <Danny_Joris> but there still might be a way to integrate it?
[22:44:31] <sequencers> Eviltwin .. okay ...
[22:44:33] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Fine, make it submit to 127.0.0.1
[22:44:36] <Danny_Joris> very cool tip anyways
[22:44:47] <Eviltwin> Danny_Joris: Actually it looks pretty good as is
[22:45:16] <Danny_Joris> thanks for your help
[22:54:23] <ArchAdmin> hi
[22:54:27] <ArchAdmin> i have a strange problem with jquery
[22:54:35] <Eviltwin> Guess sequencers solved his problem
[22:54:40] <ArchAdmin> i have a login box with ajax auth checking
[22:54:55] <ArchAdmin> in case of failure it shows an error, which then fades out
[22:55:12] <sequencers> Eviltwin, i am very sorry i am not fast enough to make it happen at your speed.
[22:55:16] <ArchAdmin> everything worked fine, however i left website open for a night, now i try to login and error just isn't showing
[22:55:25] <ArchAdmin> after page refreshing everything is fine again
[22:55:34] <ArchAdmin> wtf is going on
[22:55:53] <sequencers> i am having to convert a Ruby Widget, which is in haml, to a normal everyday form, which .. because i am working with two forms, it is a bit difficult to transpose all this at a really fast speed.
[22:56:09] <amid_hasan> is there a way to create a javascript/jquery image filter (i.e. adding an effect)
[22:56:47] <Eviltwin> ArchAdmin: Code?
[22:57:08] <sequencers> Eviltwin, Tell you what ... i will sign off and not press this query right now.  i don't have all my ducks in a row as required to be a complete professional and speedy!
[22:57:09] <Eviltwin> sequencers: All I want is an example of the data being sent to the server
[22:57:12] <sequencers> thank you for trying ..
[22:57:24] <sequencers> i am trying to do it, and i am not fast enough.
[22:57:27] <sequencers> sorry.
[22:57:33] <Eviltwin> You don't need to pixel-for-pixel create a copy of your widget
[22:57:52] <ArchAdmin> Eviltwin: function showerror(f,b,a){var d=$(b).offset();if(!d){return false}$("#errormsg").stop().hide().css("opacity","1").html(f);var
[22:57:54] <ArchAdmin> e,c;if(a=="left"){e=d.left+$(b).outerWidth();c=d.top+(($(b).outerHeight()-$("#errormsg").outerHeight())/2)}else{if(a=="top"){e=d.left+(($(b).outerWidth()-$("#errormsg").outerWidth())/2);c=d.top-$("#errormsg").outerHeight()}}$("#errormsg").css("top",c+"px").css("left",e+"px").show().animate({opacity:1},errorfadedelay,function(){$(this).animate({opacity:0}),errorfadespeed,function(){$(this).hide()}})}
[22:58:03] <Eviltwin> ArchAdmin: Please use pastebin or jsFiddle
[22:58:06] <ArchAdmin> too late
[22:58:09] <Eviltwin> And unminified code if possible
[22:58:16] <ArchAdmin> um, it isn't minified
[22:58:19] <ArchAdmin> i always write code like that
[22:58:24] <ArchAdmin> takes less space
[22:58:24] <Eviltwin> Then unpack it
[22:58:28] <Eviltwin> Use jsbeautifier or something
[22:58:29] <ArchAdmin> how?
[22:58:35] <ArchAdmin> lol
[22:58:39] <ArchAdmin> isn't it readable or what?
[22:58:50] <Eviltwin> Not really, dude
[22:58:54] <ArchAdmin> it is
[22:59:10] <Eviltwin> Well good luck getting help
[22:59:10] <ArchAdmin> maybe you just haven't much jquery / js experience if you can't understand this simple code
[22:59:44] <Eviltwin> If I can't at a glance tell how many layers of curly braces deep a function call is, I can't really debug it effectively
[22:59:47] <Eviltwin> And it is not worth my time
[23:00:01] <ArchAdmin> Eviltwin: it has 3 layers of braces
[23:00:07] <sequencers> Eviltwin .. my problem is one part is in a widget, one part is in a form, and the jquery is in two js.files, and .. having to convert is for me, a slow gig.
[23:00:15] <coldhead> shut it down
[23:00:17] <coldhead> SHUT IT DOWN
[23:00:24] <bbrandon> gordan ramsay?
[23:00:32] <Eviltwin> ArchAdmin: You are coming here for free help, convenience us
[23:00:42] <ArchAdmin> ?
[23:00:44] <ArchAdmin> what do you mean
[23:00:53] <bbrandon> ArchAdmin: GTFO
[23:01:11] <bbrandon> Eviltwin is being nice.
[23:01:11] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Do you know what HTTP is?
[23:01:22] <sequencers> yes ...
[23:01:28] <Eviltwin> Do you know how to speak HTTP?
[23:01:38] <sequencers> well i think so.
[23:01:47] <sequencers> test me, if you like to see
[23:01:51] <sequencers> quick questio ?
[23:02:02] <sequencers> quick question for me ? to see ?
[23:02:12] <Eviltwin> Okay, http://apple.com/ipod/
[23:02:16] <Eviltwin> What does that turn into in HTTP?
[23:02:57] <ArchAdmin> can i speak HTTP on this channel?
[23:03:04] <sequencers> turn into ? hmmm ... a GET request with the uri given.
[23:03:24] <Eviltwin> What are the bytes sent to the server?
[23:03:36] <Eviltwin> Somehow your browser gets the information it wants from the server
[23:03:44] <Eviltwin> I'm asking if you know how that exchange happens
[23:03:48] <ArchAdmin> Eviltwin: GET /so%20can%20you%20help%20me HTTP/1.1
[23:03:58] <amid_hasan> does anyone know if its possible to create image filter like instagram with jquery?
[23:04:02] <Eviltwin> ArchAdmin: Once you have run your code through jsbeautifier
[23:04:15] <ArchAdmin> 404 Not Found
[23:04:34] <Eviltwin> ArchAdmin: 406 Not Acceptable
[23:04:37] <ArchAdmin> GET Eviltwin/what%20is%20jsbeautifier HTTP/1.1
[23:04:48] <Eviltwin> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[23:04:56] <ArchAdmin> 200 OK
[23:05:06] <sequencers> yes ... i think i know what you are saying
[23:05:25] <sequencers> it is the serialized request, fit for server consumption.
[23:05:29] <nathggns> Does anyone see why minifying http://pastebin.com/aAskvNJa introduces the eror "missing ; before statement"?
[23:05:41] <Eviltwin> sequencers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Example_session
[23:05:48] <sequencers> okay
[23:06:09] <Eviltwin> nathggns: Try throwing in a leading ";"
[23:06:15] <Eviltwin> Before anything else
[23:06:40] <nathggns> nope
[23:06:57] <Eviltwin> nathggns: Are you using Chrome or something?
[23:07:05] <Eviltwin> Or do you know any more details about where the error is?
[23:07:08] <nathggns> I checked in both chrome and firefox
[23:07:17] <Eviltwin> Chrome Debug Tools has a pretty print option
[23:07:23] <Eviltwin> Might allow you to see specifically where the error is
[23:07:38] <nathggns> chrome gives Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[23:08:01] <Eviltwin> nathggns: Have you used the Developer Tools before?
[23:08:14] <nathggns> http://s.nath.is/25_09_11_07_08_09.png
[23:08:15] <nathggns> that?
[23:08:35] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:08:59] <nathggns> yes
[23:09:00] <Eviltwin> Click over to the script view for the script with the error
[23:09:35] <Eviltwin> Do you see a little icon like "{ }"?
[23:10:04] <nathggns> 0.o my script isn't even in the scripts lis
[23:10:05] <nathggns> t
[23:10:35] <Eviltwin> How ancient is your Chrome?
[23:11:03] <nathggns> not vert
[23:11:05] <nathggns> not very*
[23:11:27] <nathggns> http://s.nath.is/25_09_11_07_11_20.png
[23:11:44] <Eviltwin> So your script isn't in the list?
[23:11:46] <Eviltwin> Try refreshing
[23:11:55] <nathggns> nope
[23:12:15] <Eviltwin> Well can I see the source for the minified? pastebin it or something
[23:12:46] <nathggns> http://pastebin.com/apNZbzBV
[23:13:04] <nathggns> http://pastebin.com/aAskvNJa is the original
[23:13:21] <Eviltwin> Maybe try doing a find and replace with ; to ; with a newline after
[23:13:34] <nathggns> kk
[23:13:35] <Eviltwin> At least then you could narrow it down
[23:14:18] <Eviltwin> Also none of your variables are scoped
[23:14:27] <nathggns> so?
[23:14:28] <Lampoon> so are you
[23:14:47] <Eviltwin> So that's bad practice :P
[23:15:09] <nathggns> now what am I looking for?
[23:15:15] <FNTom> nathggns: Basically your variables and functions spill out and polute!
[23:15:32] <nathggns> hm
[23:15:33] <Eviltwin> nathggns: What line the error is on?
[23:15:38] <nathggns> err
[23:16:09] <nathggns> line 80
[23:16:12] * nathggns looks
[23:16:14] <Eviltwin> Okay, and that is?
[23:16:26] <nathggns> ahh found it
[23:16:48] <Eviltwin> What minifier did you use?
[23:17:07] <nathggns> multiply ones
[23:17:08] <nathggns> lol
[23:17:25] <nathggns> that one was my own to see if it was a problem with the minifiers
[23:20:19] <Eviltwin> sequencers: Still working on that?
[23:21:28] <sequencers> yeah, i don't know how to convert some of the widget to normal form, plus, i am working with two forms, one for that one text entry, which is processesd by the ruby method, then the result of that is placed into the real data entry form, the one that is processed to the database.
[23:21:56] <Eviltwin> What you need to figure out is an example working HTTP request
[23:22:06] <sequencers> i was using a jquery prompt, and putting the text entry into a variable, but that gets old, and the prompt isn't the way i want to work it.
[23:22:07] <Eviltwin> If you have the working Ruby form, change it to point to postbin or something
[23:22:40] <Eviltwin> Okay, postbin is down
[23:22:41] <Eviltwin> So not that
[23:22:53] <sequencers> i did'nt know what that mean, anyway.
[23:24:15] <Eviltwin> Honestly, I think you're in over your head
[23:24:25] <sequencers> i am going to show you what i have, in cluding the working jquery code that is processing four of the other results i need.
[23:24:48] <sequencers> i am in over my head, but .. i have gotten this far and everything in my app works and tests out, except for this last major method, which ..
[23:25:05] <sequencers> is the only method i need to run ruby in the middle of the jquery.
[23:25:39] <sequencers> okay, i pressed go and it shows, and that's cool .. it is showing the boxes that get filled in, and the data entry box.
[23:25:59] <sequencers> so, i go that much right in the jsfiddle, something i haven't used before.
[23:26:08] <Eviltwin> Can you paste the link?
[23:26:24] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle keeps things very clean for debugging and demonstrating
[23:26:40] <sequencers> i am sorry, i thought you would see it automatically !!!! because you originated the first link.
[23:26:41] <sequencers> http://jsfiddle.net/nzxyq/2/
[23:27:28] <sequencers> i just recently discovered jshint, and Love it .. i knew about jsfiddle but haven't signed up yet.
[23:28:50] <sequencers> that's cool .. it is working, with the exception of the one missing result, the sequence lexigram
[23:29:20] <sequencers> which, is not in the jquery yet as i don't know how to write it.
[23:31:15] <sequencers> Eviltwin, i am being called away for a few minutes.
[23:33:37] <Eviltwin> $.ajax({url:"/lexigram_sequenced",method:"post",data:$("form").get(0).serialize(),success:function(data){alert(data)}})
[23:33:40] <Eviltwin> Try that
[23:35:49] <Rich_Morin> Is there a simple way to undefine all of the handlers on nodes that have (say) a particular class?
[23:36:18] <Eviltwin> I don't think you can just unbind *everything*
[23:36:34] <Eviltwin> But if you want to unbind like click, mouseup, mousedown
[23:36:45] <Eviltwin> I think you can $(".class").unbind("click,mouseup,mousedown")
[23:37:10] <Rich_Morin> That looks quite promising; thanks!
[23:37:40] <Eviltwin> Sorry, spaces instead of ,'s
[23:38:24] <sequencers> Eviltwin, i am back.
[23:38:52] <Eviltwin> Try this: $.ajax({url:"/lexigram_sequenced",method:"post",data:$("form").get(0).serialize(),success:function(data){alert(data)}})
[23:39:07] <sequencers> wow . okay, thank you
[23:41:01] <Eviltwin> Correction $.ajax({url:"/lexigram_sequenced",type:"post",data:$("form").get(0).serialize(),success:function(data){alert(data)}})
[23:41:06] <Eviltwin> type instead of method
[23:41:13] <sequencers> okay
[23:42:56] <Eviltwin> I gotta go, it's almost 3am here
[23:43:01] <sequencers> Eviltwin, i will have to let you know how this works tomorrow.
[23:43:06] <Eviltwin> Okay
[23:43:11] <sequencers> thank you so much
[23:43:18] <sequencers> i have high hope.
[23:43:19] <sequencers> smile ...
[23:43:24] <sequencers> i will let you know tomorrow
[23:43:29] <sequencers> be well
[23:46:40] <Rich_Morin> If I want to use a JS object as a hash, do I have to define it first or can I simply use it, eg:  a['foo'] = 42
[23:47:39] <snover> Rich_Morin: define what first?
[23:48:37] <Rich_Morin> Do I have to define the object first, eg:  var a = {}
[23:49:31] <snover> that seems like a question you could easily answer by trying it and seeing what happens :)
[23:54:12] <ArchAdmin> what is the syntax for .replace() to replace all occurences?
[23:54:15] <ArchAdmin> without using regexps
[23:54:32] <ArchAdmin> somestuff.replace('a','b'); will replace only one occurence
[23:55:01] <ArchAdmin> my php js interpreter doesn't understand .replace(/a/g,'b'); syntax
[23:55:15] <snover> ArchAdmin: there is no other syntax to replace all occurrences.
[23:55:27] <snover> what the fuck is a php js interpreter
[23:55:34] <coldhead> lol
[23:55:37] <snover> I am pretty sure that is the worst idea ever
[23:55:39] <ArchAdmin> http://j4p5.sourceforge.net/index.php
[23:55:43] <ArchAdmin> no, not worst
[23:55:52] <ArchAdmin> i have extremely useful js code, but it is hardly obfuscated
[23:55:54] <snover> the worst idea Iâ€™ve heard so far today?
[23:56:00] <snover> or this month?
[23:56:01] <ArchAdmin> so it can't be ported to php
[23:56:02] <snover> or ever?
[23:56:13] <ArchAdmin> but i could run it through j4p5
[23:56:13] <snover> yeah, definitely am still going with â€œeverâ€
[23:56:21] <snover> it just feels right
[23:56:53] <ArchAdmin> snover: if so clever you are
[23:56:59] <ArchAdmin> why won't you help me port this code to php - http://dpaste.org/oHwTe/
[23:57:46] <snover> that would be trivial except for the fact that php is a piece of shit and still doesnâ€™t know how to deal with unicode
[23:57:53] <snover> Iâ€™m sure php6 will be out real soon now
[23:57:57] <ArchAdmin> snover: yes
[23:58:04] <ArchAdmin> well i don't have time to sit and wait for php6
[23:58:12] <snover> I am pretty sure the solution is â€œstop using phpâ€, not â€œwrite a js interpreter in phpâ€
[23:58:17] <ArchAdmin> lol
[23:58:23] <ArchAdmin> maybe stop web developing aswell?
[23:58:32] <ArchAdmin> go to work as builder/janitor etc
[23:58:47] <ArchAdmin> because php5 doesn't support unicode and use js interpreter in php is bad
[23:59:02] <snover> well, there is this magical thing that is totally not popular or talked about at all ever called server-side javascript that works kind of well for running javascript on the server
[23:59:12] <snover> you know, using a real javascript engine
[23:59:14] <ArchAdmin> what is it?
[23:59:17] <ArchAdmin> how can i use it?
